<h3 id="c1">新形勢下的重慶 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>甲：自從盟邦軍隊協助印度國民軍進兵印度以來，大東亞戰爭局面又為之一變，敵方的惶恐失措，更為明顯，在此新形勢下的重慶地位如何？</p>
<p>乙：重慶自開羅會議以來，標榜所謂「四大强國」的團結合作，特別着重於對緬甸方面的軍事行動。道次日軍新行動，確乎出於意外，所有開羅會議以來的軍事計畫，幾乎陷於全部失敗的窘境。閏國赫斯特系報紙紐約日報，紐約美國人報等近日先後發表社論，指出「日本在緬甸之攻勢，竟能突破印度邊境，此事已證明吾人如忽視太平洋戰事，實為愚蠢之至」。美國人自己這樣悲觀，則倚美國如泰山的重慶之不安與恐懼，當然不難想象了。</p>
<p>甲：軍事形勢固然蒙受絕望的打擊，但是有些人說，重慶最近的外交是相當成功的哪，你說怎樣？</p>
<p>乙：這問題須得平心靜氣地研究一下。重慶本來無所謂外交政策，辦外交不過是仰承英美的鼻息而已。然而重慶政權內一部分人士，心目中有兩大企圖却很顯然，第一是獲得美國更多的支援，第二是挑撥日蘇感情，發生戰事。這是所謂「以夷制夷」政策，也就是所謂「以不變應萬變」政策中比較具體的內容。</p>
<p>甲：這種自輕自卑的外交方針，不是曾經中共一流批駁得體無完膚的嗎、但是實際上似乎美國方面也確會假與顏色呢？</p>
<p>乙：在本質上，美國的對渝外交，可說完全以「謀略」為中心，重慶方面，實在談不到什麼平等，更說不上什麼「成功」。正如林語堂近著「又哭又笑的人生」中露骨表示的，英美人對中國人根本米曾改變其鄙視的觀念，同時中國人對英美人的印象也决不會良好。最近威爾基在他的美國總統競選演辭中，也痛斥羅斯福在內政及外交上的失策，特別提出東方人對於所謂大西洋憲章的懷疑，無異美國對東亞民族欺詐行為的自供。而重慶尙自詡對美外交的「成功」，豈不可笑？</p>
<p>甲：那麼，重慶關於日蘇衝突的幻想，一定更加失望了，前幾天不是公布了日蘇間關於延展漁約及移讓油煤權利的協定了嗎？</p>
<p>乙：正是。重慶這幾年來，始終在做日蘇戰爭的噩夢。這次日蘇新協定之成立，比較一九四一年四月十二日的日蘇中立協定，所給與重慶的打擊，實在更為嚴重，因為這次新協定不僅打擊了重慶，並且打擊了重慶所倚仗的英美當局，這幾天英美重慶關於日蘇新約所作的論調，便可看出他們如何慌惶！</p>
<p>甲：軍事外交旣然如此，重慶在內政方面所說還比較有些辦法的樣子，不是最近正在閙着普遍設立地方民意機關積極準備實施憲政了嗎？</p>
<p>乙：關於這些消息，事實上近於誇張。姑以憲政運動為重慶最近內政上最重要最良好表現的話，我想，除了極少數亳無政治認識與政治活動經騐者以外，恐怕誰也會認淸這又是重慶企圖挽回人心的新魔術而巳，實則那裹會眞正尊重民意，眞正準備還政於民？新自英國訪問返渝的「參政員」杭立武在第一次公開發表的談話中，就要求重慶當局尊重人民合法的自由，勿越法妨害人民身體居住言論出版集會的權利，這正是對重慶欺詐政策的間接的指斥（因為所謂「參政員」也沒有批評政府的發言權的）。不僅杭立武，甚至重慶的喉舌—「中央通訊社」，在舉行成立廿週年紀念會中，「社長」蕭同茲自己就提出要求在不達國法黨紀之下予該社處理新聞之自由，以免過分拘束阻其進步云云，正好揭去重慶所謂尊重民意。推行法治。準備憲政等假面具。</p>
<p>甲：這樣說來，重慶政權不是臨於外無奧援，內失威信，竟至自己的喉舌與腹心也起來反對的危險地步了嗎？</p>
<p>乙：我們在今日所可得到的結論，不過如此而已，讓我們看事實的演化吧！</p>
<p>譯評</p>
<h3 id="c2">重視視重慶與不信重慶的矛盾 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>尼米資，史蒂威爾，麥克沃塞等美國太平洋戰城的指揮者們，於侵攻馬紹爾羣島後，各自發表其對日戰略，而其戰略的基礎，都不約而同的要與渝軍協力。美國所期待於重慶者愈殷，重慶的態度愈妄自尊大不遜，不肯在美國之前低頭，互相的信賴如其崩潰，協力就不成立。並且從美國來的情報，要求重慶協力的需要愈切，美國不信任重慶，不滿意重慶之念也愈增。我們敢說，對渝軍補給的困難，及淪軍素質的惡劣，除了使尼米資和麥克沃塞在作戰的進行上感到困雖以外，更因為喪失了互相的信賴，而使反軸心軍的共同作戰歸於失敗。</p>
<p>美國所期待於重慶者，乃蘇聯在歐洲戰綫的貢獻，希望重慶在亞洲戰綫上亦有同樣的貢獻。然而從美國看來，重慶並沒有全面協力遂行戰爭的意圖。美國對重慶應允予以永久援助，有二個惡劣的影饗。其一，使重慶感到沒有盡其最大力量的必要；其二，拒絕與中國共產黨合作，不講求結集總力的方策。蔣介石以其部下最精銳的胡宗南，蔣鼎交部隊，如萬里長城般包圍共產軍，而忽視對日戰爭，美國對此極表忿懣。從美國看來，不管共產軍怎樣傾全力繼續抗戰，渝軍則僅袖手旁觀，不以戰爭為念。因而感到焦燥的美國，竟至於主張支持中共，打倒重慶。</p>
<p>最近出版的「新共和」雜誌上，有一篇題為「東亞的糾紛」的社評，引南斯拉夫的例警吿重慶。在南斯拉夫，英美獲悉了契特與德國交戰，而密哈洛維齊不與德國交戰的事實以後，就支持前者打倒後者。這先例也可適用於重慶。</p>
<p>美國要打敗日本，除了在中國大陸獲得基地以外，沒有別的方法。如依尼米資所聲明，非要求重慶全面的協力不可。凡為遂行戰爭之障碍者，必須完全排除。該誌說：蔣介石如果利用美國的援助，並利用戰爭而企圖即帝位，則不能不用別的方法加以壓迫。所謂「別的方法」者，大約就是停止援助重慶，全面支持中共。任何人不能否定，這警吿不受美國官方的授意。在開羅會談中，羅斯福和邱吉爾對蔣介石聲明，除非與中共密切合作，將停止援助重慶，此說足以證明近來的消息。美國的不信任重慶，已發展到打倒重慶論。重視重慶論的最後，就是打倒重慶論。尼米資作戰的基礎，在這裏崩潰了，美國的勝利之夢，如幻境般消逝了。（翔：譯自三月二十日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c3">昨最高國防會議通過裁撤糧食部　所有主管事務由實部接辦 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　今（十三）日最高國防會議舉行第四十五次會議，決議要案多件，茲摘錄如左，討論事項，　主席交議，擬將糧食部裁撒，所有該部主管事務劃歸實業部辦理，決議通過。　主席交議，據行政院呈為二〇三次院會通過社會福利部呈送修正勞資爭議處理法條文草案呈請鑒核，決議原則通過，交立法院審議。　主席交議，秘書處案呈，准軍委會函，為本會第一五八次常會通過，修正本會組織法一案，請轉呈鑒核，決議修正通過。　主席交蓋，據監察院梁院長摺呈，為本院監察委員尙有缺額。擬以王漢良充任，呈請鑒核，決議通過。　主席交議派趙慕儒·黃慶中·奚則文·陳端志為新國民運動促進委員會委員，決議通過。</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　最高國防會議於十三日第四十五次會議中，決議通過將糧食部裁撤，至所有該部主管事務，則由實業部接管辦理。此舉在强化戰時下糧政前途，實具有重大意義，我朝野上下對此無不異常重視。按國府還都後，即以安定民生為施政第一重點，故首先對糧食問題加以統制管理，先有糧食管理委員會之設置，進至正式參戰後，為適應戰時體制，乃將糧管會擴組為糧食部，除辦理糧食統購統配工作外，更置重點於增產方面。政府當局以數年以來對於糧食行政竭力推進者，厥在謀軍秣民食之圓滑供應，此為全國人民所一致共認者。此次當局毅然將糧食部予以裁撤，而將所有事務移歸實業部接管，足證當局對今後糧政作更進一步之推進。際此戰時下一切行政之簡素化，乃為必要之措置，故此次糧部之裁撤，實為政府實行行政簡素化之先聲。今後糧政由實業部接辦後，非但人力資力可以集中，一切事權亦可賴以統一，此於行政效率之促進上，實為不可忽視之要着。於此足證此次糧政機構之變更在表面上雖為裁撤，而在實質上則因此而增强行政效率，相信於實業部當局統一運籌之下，對於確保軍糈安定民生兩大目標，在各方熱烈期待之下，定能克底於成。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日島田少佐　闡述印緬戰况 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　日派遣軍總司令部報道部島田少佐於昨（十二日）日下午四時接見首都我國記者，就印緬曁太平洋作戰情况，闡述至為詳盡，歷一小時餘始畢，茲將島田少佐談話錄後：日印聯軍進入印度西方國境，其意義有二，一·在該方面之英渝軍被驅逐，二·日本東條目相曾經說過「要造成印度人之印度」，茲列舉印境的戰事四要點如下：　北方富貢河邊，該方面渝軍，在美史蒂維爾將軍統治下，日軍現正沿鐵道向該方面進攻中。　加薩方面敵軍，在該方面曾有四千降落傘部隊降下，唯此種戰法，因日軍憑過去對殲減小部隊之經騐，及該地敵軍給養之困難而觀，不久即可消減了。　伊姆法爾方面，戰爭現極激烈，日軍採取三方面包圍戰術進攻，該地陷落即在目前，敵人後方亦將蒙重大打擊，日軍現正向伊姆法爾前衛勒特公路及摩爾公路進攻中。勒特公路為渝空中輸送路曁陸上輸送之唯一命脈，如遭切斷，渝方將遭重大威脅。　哥希馬方面日軍戰爭已獲戰功，日軍現沿治勒特曁摩爾兩公路向伊姆法爾進攻中。</p>
<h3 id="c5">太平洋戰爭 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>方面，敵軍甚希望於短時期內結束戰爭，因此乃向中部太平洋進攻，此為極明瞭之事實，其希望短期結束戰爭之原因有三：　反軸心國作戰未能達其目的。　美國生產力已達最高潮。　長期戰爭其國內將發生厭戰及其他不利戰爭之思想，因之敵軍甚希望能於短時期內結束戰爭。敵軍將太平洋小島逐個占領，施用跳島戰術，認為是達到大陸戰的成功，敵甚欲在大陸上獲得空軍基地，所以預料今後大陸沿海轟炸，或將日益激烈。蓋駐渝美空軍不能不作困獸之鬥也。至於西南太平洋之新不列顚渡根維爾新幾內亞等各島方面目前無激烈戰爭，總之，由於此次印境作戰，日本所獲得之成功，其於整個大東亞戰局之影響，實甚為重大。</p>

<p>廣州十三日中央社電　據此間情報傳稱，重慶軍於三月上旬已將魯蘇戰區及豫魯蘇院邊區正式解消，而劃歸第一戰區，並任命豫魯蘇皖邊區長官湯恩伯為第一戰區司令長官云，蓋於于學忠指運下之魯蘇戰區軍因日軍屢次之討伐，及中共軍爭奪地盤之關係，該軍屢次失利，早已士氣不振，更因去歲吳化交榮子恒兩將軍之來歸及第八十九軍之解體，七十九軍五十一軍之移防等原因，該軍實力大減，雲歲已有將該戰區解消之訊，至本年入春以來渝軍首腦又與湯恩伯作種種協議之結果，終以此次三月中旬之改編為契機，將該地戰區實行解消。邇來蔣介石對在華北仍保持實力之舊東北軍系雖已使之中央化，達到指揮系統簡化之企圓，但亦未嘗不可謂係為彌補戰力低下而縮小戰綫之一露骨表示，同時亦可謂此舉無異對該地區內之中共勢力表示屈服，總之此次重慶軍自蘇皖地區之全體撇退，殘存於華北之唯一對日反攻據點，己終吿喪失云。</p>

<p>本市　機運動，發動以來，各界紛紛響應，踴躍捐款，頃悉本市民衆獻機委員會，為使一般國民澈底瞭解起見，特印發「獻機運動與國民的責任」一文，吿合市民衆，茲誌其全文如下：</p>
<p>盡國民的責任</p>
<p>國家興亡，匹夫有責，就是指着各個國民而言，因為國家與國民是有密切關係的，國家沒有國民，就不是一個國家，國民沒有國家，也就不能算是一個國民，尤其是國家到了危急存亡的關頭，這個保衛國家的責任，各個國民都要盡力來担負的！現在中國到了什麽時候了，是不是到了危急存亡的時候呢？大東亞的戰爭，我們中國業巳宣佈參戰了，大凡參戰的國家，不僅在口頭上宣佈就算參戰，一定要將各個國民的力量貢獻給政府，來援助政府參戰，這才算是盡了國民的責任！獻機運動，就是盡國民的責任，也就是愛國運動的表現，國家的强盛，完全在民衆的熱心和力量，國家是人民整個的集團，各個國民必須認淸自己的義務和責任，各就本位努力負担起來，誰都不能推卸這個天職，國家有了力量，當然可以强盛，如果國民放棄本位的責任，那末，國家的力量，就要逐漸衰弱，國民的命運和財產，却要陷落到悲慘的地步。</p>
<p>全力爭取勝利</p>
<p>最近還有一種人，對於自己旣不能認淸應盡責任和義務，對於國家當然不能盡量的貢獻，他的希望和口號，也不外「獨立自主」，「自由平等，」他自以為這就是愛國，其實這種態度，不但是無益於國，簡直是誤國，試聞國家强盛和復興，誰應該負担這個責任？友邦日本怎麼能為世界的强國呢？戰無不勝，攻無不克，又是他不但是器械優勝，第一是國民心理一致，愛國心普遍熱烈，各個國民都願以盡力貢獻於國家，情願自己受苦，那當然是有辦法，可以爭取勝利，不但是爭取勝利，還可以扶助東亞其他國家，爭取獨立，爭取解放。現在大東亞戰爭，已達到最後決勝階段，我們中國旣然是參戰國，故對於爭取勝利，當然有共同的責任。</p>
<p>保衛後方基地</p>
<p>際此危急存之建國大，計絕不容許各個國民，置身事外，袖手旁觀，而友邦的海陸空武裝同志，在最前綫光榮殺敵，我們應該保衛着後方。上海地方是後方最重要的基地，現在的軍事，空軍威力不可預料的，隨時都可以發生戰爭狀態，更無謂後方前方，希望上海人士，對於獻機運動，切實捐輸，勿再觀望，為國家打算，就是為自己打算，縱不為大東亞戰爭勝利着想，也應為增强國防着想，或為保全本身生命財產着想。要知道我政府在這個參戰時期，絕不容許任保居住上海的市民，袖手旁觀，置身事外。獻機運動，是每一個市民表現愛國思想，發揮各個人的力量，以整個的力量，貢獻於國家，完遂大東亞戰爭，「最後勝利。」</p>

<p>波根灣前綫　日陸海軍奪戰記　　擁有大船團的敵軍，在新不列顚烏西端登陸那一天早晨，有一個參加邀擊戰的海軍基地隊員，送一驚難得的實戰記給記者，以下就是：　　準備登陸的敵軍，開始大規校的轟炸，是在登陸前的一個月，即於去年十一月二十九日以後，白天的轟炸每日五次至六次，至多的日子，一共前後來了六百架的飛機。某山爲其轟炸的主要巨標，因爲遭受猛烈的空襲，山形幾乎改雙面目。某山居中央位置，可望波根灣，海拔二百米突，或可望到西方格羅斯達角至坦皮爾海峽。所以成爲日軍重要的陣地，全山的草木被焚境得焦　，化爲緖赤色禿山了。敵機來襲前後均有p三八型及小型飛機常常在空中哨戒飛得與森林一般的低，向各出施行機會掃射，所以不能稍有不注意。倘看見有一道烟昇起，該地附近一帶一完是被炸得一草一木也沒有。　　砲擊下敵軍登陸　　連日的飛機都是敵機，只轟着友軍飛機的來援而已，無論敵機怎樣投下作彈，冒着一切的危險，繼續修理着飛機塲，十二月十五日敵軍在馬加斯角登陸的時候，我們己察覺敵軍將在我正面實行登陸　　十二月二十六日敵軍登陸那大，夜裹三點半聽到有搖動地動的大音響發出，我軍全員跳起了。因爲這音響與普通炸彈的音響完全不同，不久監視員来報吿说是敵巡洋艦的跑擊。全員立刻配於各人的位置，敵軍的砲擊似乎以我基地爲目標，極其熾烈，砲彈在近傍炸裂了，好像頗近海岸來。雜在砲彈炸裂聲中，機槍向我兵會掃射，經過半個鐘頭，上午四點鐘的時候，大將明龍界也漸漸明瞭，離海岸綫約十浬乃至二十浬附近，看得有黑黝的船團，運輸船一萬噸級及五千噸及約有十數艘，護衛巡洋艦若干艘，大型驅逐艦若十艘，海上似乎還有其他的船團。　　邀擊準備完妥　　可以看得出敵船團紛紛放出舟艇，再經過半小時至四時半，有敵轟炸機及戰鬥機通合約八十架飛來，天已很亮了。巡洋艦及驅逐艦的砲門，繼續射擊而來，敵軍在艦砲與飛機的掩護下，開始第一次的登陸了。登陸用舟艇內大軍，全部向着飛機塲及格羅斯達角的登陸地點，我海軍基地正面有若干艘的敵艦進來，我們到於登陸而來的敵軍，無論何時都可加以射擊，各到陣地待機着。　　友軍飛機雄姿　　敵軍第一次登陸，乃於開始登陸後約五小時，即於午前九時四十分結束。我基地的西方，由格羅斯達角有猛烈的砲嚮。因爲與陸軍部隊的聯絡被其切斷，陷入獨力狀態，所以不能探知戰鬥展開的狀况。在海空控制下，敵軍白書堂棠等陸而來，如果我們有飛機的後援，決不使敵軍踏上此島。至十二點半鐘第二次的敵船團來了，渾輸船若干艘，護衛的巡洋艦若干艘，大型驅逐艦若干艘。運輪船在離格羅斯達東方海岸五里乃至十里的水面停錨，船的間變左不多一千米突，護衛艦即在海上游弋，後方有機關部之接岸用特殊運輸船，將開始登陸，船上滿載着戰車，汽車及兵員。正在這時候，由東方海上來了一車猛烈的新分級聲，一瞬間，只期待着友軍飛機的出現。我陣地的東方，正與格羅斯達岬相對有一個岬突出，由那岬的對方，出現了飛機編隊，隊伍整然，飛機與飛機之間隙差不多有一千米突，對敵運轍船猛搏而去。呀，這是友軍的飛機，呌喚的聲從機槍陣地的隊員而出。在空中哨戒中的敵機與友軍飛機，開始劇烈的空戰。我轟炸機只直接作低空飛行，向目標突進而去。不一會，敵大型運輸船二艘被我飛機擊沉，接著有端由五千噸級敵船及格羅斯達岬一萬噸級的敵船兩艘，吐出黑烟，相繼沈沒，一方面將要登陸的敵兵數千及數萬噸的器材，被我海軍飛機猛攻之下，瞬息之問，沉滅於波根灣的海底了。敵巡洋艦及驅逐艦，在運輸船遭受攻擊之後，才開始砲擊我機，敵艦在黝黑的彈幕中，以全速力逃向海邊區。我轟炸機的第二編隊，襲擊遁逃的敵艦羣，因爲有敵機的妨碍與敵艦的防擊砲火，友軍我飛機突破了猛列的火網，向敵艦突進的姿容，確是「神救」。尤其是對敵巡洋艦猛撞而自炸的我飛機之勇敢，眞是可歌可頌，向着敵艦搏去的我轟炸機，蒙受砲彈似的，吐出了一條的黑烟，機體上看見着火，的是危險，要發火的瞬間，該號即抱着炸彈向敵艦的中央部艦橋下邊撞去，濛濛的黑烟與永烟並起，敵艦終於爆炸而沈。此外與斗這並排的另一艘巡洋艦，亦遭受致命的炸彈沉沒下去。更有其他的巡洋艦及驅逐艦三艘，也蒙受彈片，一面吐出黑烟，一面拼命而逃。自我飛機開始攻擊以來，僅十五，六分之間，這麼收到偉大的戰績。　　控制敵機採取反攻　　我們全員在陣地觀看每看了敵船被我機炸沉，發出大音響時，我們無不拍手稱快。過去幾個月間，我們畫夜被敵機威脅。現在却可洩恨而無這了。而轟炸敵軍登陸地點的海岸綫，可望見數處捲起黑烟，在我機控制敵機的中間，陸上的友軍部隊勇氣百倍，轉守爲攻，對敵軍加以猛烈反擊。　　敵登陸地點的方向聽到活潑的槍砲聲響來，北美利堅型飛機，在我們眼前一架一架的吐出火焰而墜。待到由海岸突進三千米突前方海面的我飛機飛走以後，前方又來了一批新敵機約一百架。和以前的敵機差不多有二百架，這些敵機，再開始向其山附近海岸綫一帶的友軍陣地狂擊了。　　某隊員的報吿就在這襄結束，波根灣的戰鬥，由我陸海軍的勇敢挺戰，雖在敵機的控制下，予敵軍以重大損失之後，現在一後方整理戰綫中。（譯自三且十五日朝日新聞。）德英防禦空襲的方法　　自從德空軍於去年十月重行猛炸倫敦以來，以德軍對英美軍的首都爲中心目標之都市轟炸的互和酬答，日趨熾烈。兩軍都盡其死力，竭人智之所能，從事攻防。由於新銳飛機，新兵器的出現，攻擊方面有長足的進步。而防禦方面。亦同樣愈趨周密而有効。茲試介紹最近德英的防禦戰術之一端：　　英　　英國對空防禦的最大長處，是從一九四〇年秋倫敦大火時代的艱苦經騐中所產生的官民一體的防空機構。如圖中的說明，防空觸角的最前端杜佛海峽岸邊的哨戒機，巡邏船，海岸監視哨（主力為電波探知機），將「敵機到達」的警報迅急傳達至先頭區部。其方法是用電報，電話，發火信號等。警報從先頭區部隊防空國部—戰門機隊司令部—地區委員會—團本部—而遠地方統管局。這時候各單位一接警報，就照下面步驟行動。卽先頭區部向前進戰門機隊，防空團部向阻塞氣球隊，戰鬥機隊司令部向英空軍省並航空隊司令部，地區委員會向特殊任務班（包括民間防空團體），並炸彈處理班，特方統管局向救急班，特殊任務班，監視哨，及其他團體，報告並發佈必要的命令，直接防空活動由戰門機隊司令部處理，地區委員會及其他組織則担任預防並處理災書的工作。　　德　　德國的防空陣勢，因英美軍的轟炸，士氣愈爲激易，擁有遠較英國爲龐大的防空機構。且不同於英國者，從海岸到德國本土主要提防的距離頗達，故其防空機構亦達較英國偉大而周密，加以德國關機隊的「空中要塞」邀擊戰法，即英美本身也承認漸趨巧妙而有效。去年秋聞，以英國爲基地的美轟炸機隊，空襲德國的許華印夫爾特時，美空軍以舉被擊落六十架，而相顯失色。這大打擊是圖中所示德國的新兵器與新戰術所造成的。那就是火箭機與「銀片」。轟炸機隊要安全且有效的襲擊敵土，非編成緊密的隊伍不可。火箭機就是爲了攪亂這編隊而產生的。尾追在飛翔中的「空中要塞」背後的火箭機（有雙發的，也有四發的，其詳細不明），向這隊伍的正中放射速射砲彈、隊伍散亂了，德國戰關機乃從上空飛下攻擊。另一新兵器是「銀片一。飛向美轟炸機隊上空的德機，突然放射靑白色的光，捲成一團·這銀片羣中間的一個碎減時，「空中要塞」就意架一架的被包圍在火焰中墜落下去了。此外，從地上發射的速射砲彈，和新型空中定時炸彈，德軍用后獲效頗大。關於「銀片」，在美空軍尙是一個迷，見之頗為頭痛。即在德國亦因爲是一種秘密的武器，此後似乎不常見使用。（譯自三月二十八日西部每日新聞）敵美飛機裂造近況　超等重轟炸機將出現　　美國「波音」式。B29長距離轟炸機，有「超空的要塞」之稱，現正遂漸進入大規模製造的階段。本年初重轟炸機製造公司統一公司董事長赫里·島特海特惠宣稱：「合克撤斯州的福特滑斯廠，已生產新式四發動機的超等長距離飛機，並將完成B32式飛機的生產。」敵美企國利用長距轟炸機對日空襲，其野心的具體化，於是可見。B29的出現和B32的計　，可以顯示敵美飛機的生產，正朝着超巨型機的方向。補充現用的B17「空中要塞」，統一式B24等，舉全力從事長距離轟炸機的製造。自去年秋天，供給吉爾具特爲尼米茲（美國太平洋艦隊司令）攻勢入於轟炸陛段，襲擊特　克·隊巴恩·特尼盎等處，一方面强化中國內地的基地，企圖　機空製日本本土。所謂「超空的要塞」「空中戰艦」等重轟炸機羣的出現，自屬醫療中事。　　向以製造「飛剪」號等巨型飛機著名的美國波音飛機製造公司，自一九三六年年試造「空中要塞」B17以來，更參酌實戰的經騐，完成同樣的E型和F型，其主要部份爲十五米厚的主板裝甲，機首裝十二·七米厘口徑的砲座五挺，共完成重武裝的重轟炸機約十三四架，但在廣漠的太平洋戰局之前，最大速率每小時四八八公里美國軍事當局乃鼓勵國內航力達一萬公里的重轟炸機，波音式B29，統一式B32，洛基特式B49的機羣，由是而生，茲就B29加以　則。　　波音式B29巨型轟炸機，裝有二千五百匹馬力的發動機四座，全部重量四十　，最大速率每小時六百公里，上升限度一萬五千公尺，續航距離八千公里，具備種種優點。但據外電所傳，這種行將出世的飛機，全部重量約四十五噸乃至五十噸，製數炸彈八噸時，可行千六百公里，裝戰二噸時，可行五千公里，巡航速度，高度八千公尺弱，每小時速四百公里。　　開戰后的美國，已到達生產技術和學理的最高水準，但是否配合馬澤不計較，畢竟因為裝有重二千匹馬力的發動機四座，績航距離不能延長，現用的長距離轟炸機，欲其一備爾維眞政超長距離轟炸機尙未成功，在實際戰爭上，可以活用至何項程度，也是疑問。況且自距離東京四千公里的密特威島岸邊，對日恩本土作空襲等，尙不過是幻想而已。（譯自三月二十四每日新聞）白茅竹靑之死  朱麟　　「竹青自殺了！　　「死在無錫。」　　當中午蔣霞泣不成聲的在電話裹這樣吿訴我時　我簡直震驚得呆住了。　　還是十天之前，她爲了和命遝抒扎，帶着楚痛的心從無錫出來會過幾個相熟的人，但殘酷的現實和無力的友人所回答她的祇是失望的愁苦。　　是悄然地送別，悄然地離去，誰知這默默地分離竟是我們的永訣？　　二年前竹靑在靑女中念書時，我是她們高二級的導師，孩子們以奔放的熱情，純潔的理想，開拓自己的生活，我從靑年羣流的勇猛進取中得到了熱和力，回返了自己年輕的心。　　事變失去了我們的學校，但孩子們沒有離開我，在我的小屋子裹，還是洋溢着同學們健壯的笑聲，學校才停頓的幾個月中，我的家無形中變成了同學們聚會的中心。　　在成天的漫談中，竹靑是最吸住我注意的一個，藍布火褂裹者裏矮小的身艦，一對光亮的黑眸子嵌在沉實的臉龐中，說話時老帶着江陰口氣的語尾，她是一個思想淸淅，行動爽快，有識見，有理想的好孩子，是在同輩中頗顯得不平凡的一個好靑年。　　隨着時局的安定，同學們都找到了新的歸宿，竹靑也於二月中回到故鄉無錫去了。　　黑暗的社會所給予靑年的，像永遠祇有苦悶，對於正直如竹靑的，當然更會感到煩惱，年靑人都懷着美麗的夢想，但現實展示的却祇是醜惡的黑暗面，烏烟瘴氣的家鄕，固然使竹靑失望，而由父親頑固，母親懦怯，姨娘嬌寵，兄長墮落所組成的家庭，更使她無可奈何地忍受着悲憤。　　她第一次來信會這樣損壞訴我。　　「……姨娘整天發脾氣，爸爸始終陪笑臉，媽生病了，爸連藥賬都不肯付，哥哥成天酗酒胡鬧，嫂嫂祗是躲在屋角裹哭，在全世界的漫天烽火裹，時代儘管動盪，却搖撼不　　「書是幾乎讀不成，媽在爸頤指氣使下陪小心，終見讓她的女兒進了學校。　　「爸爸說：「再讀一年盡要嫁了你的。」不是，管她呢？顧了眼前再說吧！　　接着，我收到了幾期他們在鄕間自辦的油印文藝週刊「南光」，我太高興了，因爲雖然袛是薄薄的一本油印刊物，但對面的設計，版式的編排，印刷的精細，內容的豐富，都使我感到驚奇，靑年的創造力是偉大的，靑年人自己在摸索着前進的道路，竹靑向我索稿，我寫了一篇「致年靑者」，同時還附了一封信告訴她：「不要太露鋒芒，否則是會遭逢困難的。「果然，來信證實了我的憂慮，以後就沒再看見「南光」了　　夏天以後的半年中，竹青給了我很多的信，每次都沉重地吐露着被壓抑的熱情，對於苦難的現實，發出正義的控訴。　　今年春天，却又爲了姑媽的死，白熱起她蟄伏着的正義感了；　　「姑媽病了，不請醫生不吃藥，她自從做「姑夫」背棄回來已經十幾年了，祖母死後，爸爸從沒有好待過她，就在病中，也從沒提起過她一次。　　「街上的彭巫婆說：「祖墳不安逸，要送鬼。」千是就在喧擾的送鬼聲中，姑媽給送進了鬼門關　　「其實，吝　的爸是不肯爲姑媽化錢，她是嫁出的妹子，早不姓×了，犯不上替她化錢醫病。　　「但，姑媽死後的喪事到辦得體面，化了一筆相當的款子，那是爲了碍于爸爸在郷間的地位與面子，也未了能陶醉于淸客們一聲：「這老兄眞有良心」的阿誤。　　「有「良心」的父親不就是殺死姑媽的眞眞的兇手？」　　「所以我寗願做沒有良心的叛逆女兒，我憎恨他們。」　　於是他開始不安於鄉居了，一連寫了許多憤激的信，要我帮助他離開家。　　我去信希望她冷靜，希望她能把憤激轉化爲深刻的理解去帮助自己懂得更多和更透澈。但也許是因她失望於我這「樣健派」，（她來信曾這麼這麼呼過我）以後竟有三四個月中斷了她的音訊。　　直到今年七月初，我才又意外興奮地接獲她的來信，和我商討投考醫專的事情，原來，她將從中學舉業了。　　「回鄕侯的一年多來，痛苦的現實給了我許多磨折，我像瞎子在暗中摸索似的失去了方向有時像在什麼地方閃現着星星之火，待到把捉時它又遙遠地躲起來了，我想，與其讓自己的思想在無邊的海洋裹衝撞，還是脚踏實地去學習一種專門技術吧　　「因此，我選擇了醫科。」　　「聽說，約翰的醫科不收女生，那麼替我要一張同德的章提來吧！」　　可是，我還沒有來得及回信，一連的快信又接着飛來了，因爲她發現了父親正進備着嫁走他的女兒。　　「父親本來從沒贊成過女孩子念書的，學醫的事，原祇是媽的心軟，經不起女兒一再苦苦哀求才答允了的，媽替我打算過，就說爸爸不肯肯出錢來，典買首飾也夠我念完六年醫科的，她三十年來在丈夫的淫威下，嘗夠了做「太太」的滋味了。　　「可是當爸爸發覺了我升學的準備時，他聲色俱厲的對媽說：「你要讓竹靑出去念火學，你帶他滾！」　　「媽有什麼辦法呢？忍氣吞聲地被凌辱了三十年了，她還能和自己的命運去抗爭嗎？何况爸更獰笑着對我說：「老實告訴你，趙家已經來提過了，今年是一定得把你娶過去的。　　「這一下像對我判決了死刑，我戰慄了。」　　我眞惶恐極了。面對着還個現實的難題，如果僅僅發斗通空論，對於竹靑會有什麼帮助）？當然，我更不忍心看兌一個好孩子被結婚葬送了她光輝的前途，於是，我會試着希望她：　　「千萬不要感情用事，鎭定起來冷靜地去應付事情·對於爸爸要體貼，也在不必要的塲合可以現得非常柔順，待姨娘也得親切些，拉住媽媽在實際上支持自己，不要從正面去反對說事，祗要想法延遲一年半載再說，到延遲成功了，再慢慢爭取升學。」　　怎奈，現實是越來越無情：　　「媽呌了漆匠在光『我的』桶器傢具了，這表示她已光我屈服，爸近時也對我現出從未有的關心與體貼，你會知道那是爲甚麼的，時機急迫極了，聽說日子就在陰歷九月底。　　「叛逆吧！走！可是上那兒去？丟下了苦命的娘又怎麼辦？爸是頑固到連走都嚇不退他的，剩下的祗是娘受累，「看你生的好女兒！」順從吧！我愛我自己其於一切，我不忍燬了自己去成全那些憎恨的人。　　「詐病，恐嚇，哭泣，對於父親都不會發生絲毫效力，於是有一天我說到了死！可是媽說：「讓娘先走一步」！」　　「媽決不是胡說，茍活忍辱了三十年了，除了惟一的女兒存在之外，她有甚麼留戀的；自我有記憶的十幾年來，已經不止一次看見媽從死神手裏奪回了生命。」　　「我這才懂得了女人和淚水為甚麼結了不解綠，媽的淚水和我的淚水流在一起，她常常在我與她相偎對泣的時候顫動起說。「竹靑！爲甚麼不投個男胎替媽爭。氣呢？」　　「現在眞是山窮水盡的絕境了，生命的路太窄了，寬廣的時間，竟容不下我這渺小的女孩子？」　　這凄切的低訴，像巨石似的壓在我胸口，我奮然地鼓起勇氣來要和竹靑找一個可以離開家的前提——一個可以暫時生活的辦法，怎奈，出路之對於不幸的人竟表現得非常吝嗇。　　於是就在十天之前那一次，她突然出現在我眼前了，深陷在憔悴的雙頰中的眼珠已失去了昔日充滿希望的光彩，收歛的嘴角邊逃走了曾經洋溢着生命力的笑聲，現實的皮鞭殘酷地在磨折着一個有爲的靑年。　　在上海的幾天中，我們會見了三次，大部分的時間都在沉歟中，我沒有說什麼安慰的話，當一個人需要事實帮助的時候，空言安慰對別人是欺驅，在自己是恥辱。　　可是，重行奔走的結果，却不能給竹靑有什麼帮助，職業的大門之對於女子是不容易敲得開的。　　最後，還是勉强同意了章體的意見，在必耍時候到他們夏溪去住一下再說。　　竹靑要走了，先得再回一次家，才偷偷地躲到夏溪去，我懷着沉重的憂　送她，臨行，我緊緊地握着她的手，怨憤和內疚交織的情緒阻塞勒沃的喉嚨，像送走一投無辜的羔羊去受屠似的，我禁不住飽含了一眶淚水。　　「過幾天我帶幾個同學到夏溪來瞧你！」　　我好容易才迸出了這句話，她已掉頭上車去了　　「寫信來：事在人爲，一切終有辦法的。」　　她回過來和我點電頭　　這最後的一瞥，我祗見她在蒼白的臉上展現出一絲　笑。　　像一股冰流沁入我的心底。　　記憶是那麼淸晰，竹靑的印象生動地在我眼前閃現，而對着她一字一句用心血嘔成的一堆信件和文稿，我不能相信一個活潑聽明的女孩子已經悄悄地離開了朋友，離開了世界，永遠不再回到這醜惡的人間來了。　　但，千眞萬確的，她死了，她被這可咀咒的社會以血盆大口活生生地吞食了，她被頭固的對建家庭絞殺了她的呼吸，我悲哀，自己失去了一個難得的學生，我痛惜，祖國犧牲了一個優秀的子孫，我憤恨，陰霾的時代替孩子們安排的祇是悲慘的命運　　用死來逃避慘痛的現實，本不應該頌贊，但我能以懦怯來誣蔑竹靑嗎？當多少人今天迷糊於生命的行程需變成行屍時，竹靑的死還至少表示了對於時代的抗議，保持了生的意志的完整。　　因此，我不能不對長眠黃土的竹靑，寄予無限崇敬的悼念。　　安息吧：竹靑：你　星的殞落，將導着我們的行進。讀書  勞碌　　我恨的是讀書的消遺者。（尼采）　　休假日是呌我們不讀學校中的教科書，而讀更偉大的社會的　。（蕭曼）　　關於書本的事我只有一句話要說，即讀書並不是學問的主要部份。（洛克）　　盡信書不如無書。（我國古諺）　　如果誰要讀好書，誰就要應該避免壞書。（叔本華）　　我謮了許多惡書。惡的東西和善的東西一樣，都有實際而正確地知道的必要。（高爾基）　　有些書是靑該淸嘗的，有些是應該整吞的，又有少數的書是應該細嚼。應該小伙的。（倍根）　　謮書這一件事，和所謂用功，是決不相同的，這正如散步的事，不必定是休息一樣。讀書的眞的意義，是在於我們怎樣地讀書。（鶴見　輔）風箏  蘭　　　是春天了呢，已頗有點陽春溫暖的感覺了。却是並不少掉刺人的風，應該是東南風呢，感不到多大冷。如果你　寂寞，走上街頭，漫步於溫和的陽光下，抬頭看靑藍色的天，於是，一個個風箏在你眼　中出現了，它更使你明顯地感到，是春天了呢。　　憑了一點兒聰明，憑了一點兒物理的作用，一些紙張一些竹層與一點漿糊，就給做出些奇禽異　來。沒得福份領受教育的兒童們，上天就賦給了他們這聰明的技能。樸質的小靈魂喲！護着這氣質，該黨有更偉大的成功與發明。　　那　在一根弱而細的　　上的風箏，任是風兒如何能施盡戰迫與摧殘，彷彿是一個具有犧牲精神的業術的殉道者，要完成一幅自然圖書中的最後的一筆，不屈不　地直上靑雲，以不負所應盡的使命：這頁是最好的人生象徵形容人生，春天該是最得意的時候，個人事業的成功，雖說是有得美滿的環境，然而不可免的有得意外的波折，這其問是要具有幾許能耐；這其問是要施展幾許才智：不怕打擊，不怕失敗，不愁自已不會成功，只愁自已不能努力。然後，穩可地得到一條平坦的階梯，扶搖直上青雲。　　往往風箏放到雲際，它已是不受任何牽制，似乎是要求最后的解脫一般，未了，竟是乘風飛逝！我感慨到個人的事業，地位，名譽，到得一個相當的時期，應該有一個　止，讓自己得以反省，不至陷入於驕傲狂逸的境地。庶幾尙能保存原來的自己，無求諸全，無求諸毀，中庸之道，應該壞有保存的價值。</p>

<p>體育北星隊　丙戰印象記  梅必賢　　華北藍球素稱雄全國，於是衆口一辭，認為華北籃球係我國發祥地。滬上獨多球迷，且愛看北派者更多。蓋南開良華征滬後留人之印象太深，且自良舉隊之後，倐已十餘戰，從華北籃球隊來滬，此所以此次北星隊之征滬。轟動整個球壇，造成中靑球房空前之盛况。按目下北星已出戰二仗，對西靑華聯藥廠俱吿敗挫，然我人決不能以成敗諭英雄，該隊自有其令人滿意之處，反之，亦不乏可以指摘之點。鄙人不避井底之見，作北星征滬印象記不當之詞，尙祈該隊當局球壇前輩及各界人士，予以指導，則不負本意，茲逐　分析各點：　　戰術新穎　一挽頹氣　　夫北方籃球在我人所見到者均為五人聯防法一種戰術，回憶世運會我國籃球隊之失敗，絕非人村之不如人，厥為董守義之墨守陳法，不知臨時改變策略。我盡至此，猶覺抱恨無窮。而此次北星隊突表現採用人釘人戰術，不論其是否成功，然其原則已足徴富有進取，一洗陳舊頹稱心如意，為我人所最値得稱頌者。　　體力充沛　道德優良　　體力充沛因為北方之特點。該隊全體當亦具此條件，且各個甚見平均，其運動道德，尤為有目共賞之事。夫北方球隊，舉動粗野者，非無之，而觀乎北星隊作戰時之沉着鎭靜，毫無一般習氣。故余信雖連敗二場，而今晚戰中北之役，其號召力決不稱弱，此運動道德感人之深。　　姿態美觀　演出平淡　　此點應為北方人之環境逼使而成，我人觀乎北派球迷觀球者，終以「幹脆：」「這玩意兒不差」，故北隊太多用單手表演式傳遞，為北地傳統思想，遺傳至今，在姿勢方面，不失美觀，亦正足以為呌好之表演。唯查嚴格基本訓練籃球中，絕無單手傳遞動作，此僅為美觀，而無把握之動作也。故整個隊伍之演出，不免因而現出平淡，亦因以傳遞失的後，復猛力以冀搶圓，造成犯規，為不可取也。　　球路狹窄　尙少變幻　　北方球隊特別優良者較少，不若滬上之普遍。據該隊范隊長云：在北平天津用人釘人者，可說絕無僅有。在滬連戰中，頗覺始終有一敵人死釘在本人面前，頗覺異樣，究之此為少切磋而致此，綜觀其二塲中，退守時用人釘人，其地位未能立在敵人敵籃之間，以致有過於近身之時，則易犯規或為　進。過遠之時，則被遠射。更之，其　路綫時，未能依大弧小弧而走，極致洛於人後，進攻時，側重兩角，不注重中路進攻，中鋒太落後，前鋒與後衛缺少連繫，兩塲中，均有此種極顯明之情形。　　指導乏從　後備不足　　夫籃球隊應為「三一化」。云何者：即一球隊一指導一條心，可以此喻：兩鋒猶手，兩衛猶足，中鋒猶頭。一指導即為教導此人應如何上軌進。北星隊頗擬做到此點，亦極似已經做到此點，賞則頗嫌不足，其場外指導，實未能盡事前以及半塲時，終場後，在各方面，予以諄諄指點為憾事。而該隊後備人員之不足，亦為最大之缺點，旣為還征軍，非有適當之後備人員不可，簡而言之，萬一以水土不服等情形下，如人數不足時，將以何應付耶？　　浪擲過多　獲球太少　　記者曾注意該隊在滬兩賽中，其投籃之次數，並不少於西靑及華聯。因此一般批評謂：籃圈不熟，地板不慣，此實誤解。夫籃圈離地之尺寸，固南北無分，即圈兒大小，亦無分別。况據記者所知，北方亦極多室內比賽，然則其所以投而不中者，應歸咎於角度不準，時間不對耳。心理變態，容或有之。又該隊對於獲球權之重要性，似未能深切領會。故時見其得球後在輕易中喪失，射籃不中後，亦不能全力雲跟進，此亦為其失敗之焦點也。　　鄙人對於北星隊之印象，大致如上。唯綜觀二場比賽，予我之印象確極深切，故敢以至誠之心作結論。以該隊之人村平均，體力充沛，富進取心，以及優良道德，則假以時日克苦訓練，決可蔚成全國最强隊之一。語簡意長，顧北星健兒，三復斯言！　　書至此，對於今夜該隊三度出兵，迎戰中北，不得不賞獻數點，以供參考，不顧遺笑大方也。現略述下列六點：　　　利用其短小精悍之身材，可多作下路傳遞。　　　不必過於拘泥，以及强作鎭靜，發揮北方之「勇」字。　　　謹防對方速攻時之籃下偸襲。　　　進攻時應多用阻擋法，中距離投射，以及製造空隙籃底　入法。　　　守衛時用人釘人，地位絕對立得不錯。（前段所謂敵人敵籃之間）　　　必要時可利用後衛偸襲。　　上述六點，該隊極可做到，能如斯，則未始無取勝之機會也。北星　華聯藥廠兩籃球隊合影（康祖藝君攝）最近上海籃壞賽中　各球隊攻勢方式（下）　　除速進遠擲外應另採四種突破陣法　　　洽當的障蔽　　障蔽（Block　Screen）在攻用人釘人之防綫時，效用很大。但在地域防裹，也可以應用。我國人大都不考究　種技術。惟有很簡單的這種方法，常見人應用。例如：甲得球，擬前進投籃，過敵衛則回身　給後面同伴。同時自憶站定，橫伸雙臂，保護同伴，讓他從容投籃。障蔽方法如用得不妥當，則很滑稽。常見一人裝腔作勢，奔到敵方守衛之身後一站，意在為被此衛所監視之同伴設障，使他脫身。而此同伴，莫明其妙，不能領會這番好意。有時吃力不討好，反受犯規之處罰。障蔽之花樣很多。有外障，內障，人障，障人，或掩護。帶球之同伴進攻，或用以擺脫敵衛之監視，在地域防衛的陣綫內，各守衛均嚴守各人陣地，很難調虎離山。如障蔽用得洽當，能佔光一步之便宜，籃球在緊要關頭，缺少一步則差之毫厘，失之千里。　　　有組織之陣法　　慢進急攻，是很時髦的攻勢。木隊得球時前鋒馳往敵之塲角二衛，一運球，一在旁照料。在十秒鐘內攻入敵區球的進行很慢。領隊則大動腦筋，用那種陣方Formation呢？中央突破呢？還是兩翼包抄呢、决定之後，即發信號通知各隊員，球過中綫，攻擊開始。常見一防衛嚴密之塲面，守衛均劍拔弩張的等在那裏，無孔可入。但經過數次傳球幾記穿挿，再加上一點障蔽，則門戶洞開，局面大變矣。這種戰略，是有組織的。預先計劃好了的，每人在一定時間內，在每種塲合，須執行某種任務。時間與空間，必須合拍。下棋有棋譜，打球有球譜，五花八門，各有千秋。名敎練均有幾套得意的球譜，我國人打球，不相信這一套。打起來再說，有時信手拈來，盡是佳搆，有水到渠成之妙，往往很高深的陣方能於無意中得之。要照這樣再來一次，則不可能。有時則東奔西跑，毫無頭緒。這種攻勢等於遊擊戰，陣方不容易練。筆者曾見一個球隊，照着圖樣死練。上塲時莫明其妙，滿頭大汗，球在手裏不能脫手。巨人練了六七年，也常常不能得心應手。但是基本技術完善的球隊，就能當研究，加强其攻勢。曾見善用有組織攻勢之球隊，能在地城防綫內，來去自如。使五個守衛，等於五根柱子，立在那裏。　　全篇大意，希望滬上籃球隊，除了用遠射和速進，對付地域防衛外，能有　高速度之傳球，　巧妙之切入，　洽當之障蔽，和　有組織之進攻，侵入敵籃下投籃。體壇花絮　　北星籃球隊征滬第一戰，雖其票價，超過已往任何比賽。然于二小時內，八百張票立刻買光，乃臨時又發現不少黑巿票囊者，其價有抬至四百元以上者。　　此次球迷竭盡捧北星隊之能事，猶觀京戲之情形，如出一轍。　　聞華影籃球隊決邀北星隊至該公司作表演賽，以為同人無機前往觀球者，一增限界。唯日期極為秘密，不識球迷有福一　北星隊之硬地作風否？　　無錫體育場已有戰迎北星隊蒞錫比賽之舉動。　　遠征健兒在滬消遣，極為正當，此為最値得稱頌者。　　聯誼足球隊因退出滬足聯賽，乃有出征華北之舉，日內即將啓程，預祝一帆風順，奏旋而回：　　一部份新聞記者組織之天光藍球隊加入中靑二組，現已有隊員離滬，故希望仝人中好手，踴躍參加，以厚實力。　　三省女子籃球隊隊長史瑞娟，忙于球事之外，亦在忙置嫁粧，聞新人係四明銀行行員。時事画刋　　　1準備出擊之日重轟炸機　　2自同印度國民軍領袖鮑斯氏發表進兵祖國聲明時情形　　3向伊姆法爾急進的印國民軍機械化部隊　　4與日軍駢肩作戰的印度國民軍步兵隊　　5片刻不懈的日軍防空隊　　6在飛行甲板上整隊的日新銳機　　7日本馬隊於本月七日愛馬　在上海靜安寺路游行道旁日僑觀者如堵</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chongqing Under the New Circumstances <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>A: Since the Allied forces assisted the Indian National Army in advancing into India, the situation in the Greater East Asia War has undergone another change, and the enemy's panic and helplessness have become even more obvious. What is the status of Chongqing under this new situation?</p>
<p>B: Since the Cairo Conference, Chongqing has emphasized the unity and cooperation of the so-called "Four Great Powers," especially focusing on military operations in Myanmar. The sudden actions of the Japanese army indeed came as a surprise, and all military plans since the Cairo Conference have almost fallen into a complete state of failure. Hearst newspapers such as the New York Journal-American and the New York American have recently published editorials, pointing out that "Japan's offensive in Myanmar has actually broken through the Indian border, which proves that it is extremely foolish for us to ignore the Pacific War." If the Americans themselves are so pessimistic, then it is not difficult to imagine the unease and fear of Chongqing, which relies on the United States like Mount Tai.</p>
<p>A: Although the military situation has suffered a devastating blow, some people say that Chongqing's recent diplomacy has been quite successful. What do you say?</p>
<p>B: This issue requires calm and dispassionate study. Chongqing has no so-called diplomatic policy of its own; its diplomacy is simply following the lead of Britain and the United States. However, it is very obvious that some people within the Chongqing regime have two major goals in mind: first, to obtain more support from the United States; and second, to provoke conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, leading to war. This is the so-called "using barbarians to control barbarians" policy, which is also the more concrete content of the so-called "responding to all changes with invariance" policy.</p>
<p>A: Isn't this self-deprecating and self-abasing diplomatic approach something that the Chinese Communist Party has criticized thoroughly? But in reality, it seems that the United States is indeed pretending to be friendly?</p>
<p>B: In essence, the United States' diplomacy towards Chongqing can be said to be completely centered on "strategy." Chongqing cannot really talk about equality, let alone "success." As Lin Yutang bluntly stated in his recent book "The Gay Genius", the British and Americans have fundamentally not changed their contempt for the Chinese, and at the same time, the Chinese impression of the British and Americans will never be good. Recently, Wendell Willkie, in his US presidential campaign speech, also denounced Roosevelt's failures in domestic and foreign policy, especially mentioning the Eastern people's doubts about the so-called Atlantic Charter, which is tantamount to an admission of American fraud against the nations of East Asia. And Chongqing still boasts of the "success" of its diplomacy with the United States, is it not ridiculous?</p>
<p>A: Then, Chongqing's fantasy about a Japanese-Soviet conflict must be even more disappointing. Wasn't the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on extending the fishery treaty and transferring oil and coal rights announced a few days ago?</p>
<p>B: Exactly. For the past few years, Chongqing has been having nightmares about a Japanese-Soviet war. The establishment of this new Japanese-Soviet agreement, compared with the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact of April 12, 1941, has given Chongqing an even more serious blow, because this new agreement not only hit Chongqing, but also hit the British and American authorities that Chongqing relies on. The tone of the British, American, and Chongqing authorities on the new Japanese-Soviet agreement these past few days shows how panic-stricken they are!</p>
<p>A: Since the military and diplomatic situation is like this, Chongqing seems to be saying that it has some methods in domestic affairs. Isn't it currently clamoring for the universal establishment of local public opinion organs and actively preparing to implement constitutional government?</p>
<p>B: These messages are in fact close to exaggeration. If we take the constitutional movement as the most important and best manifestation of Chongqing's recent domestic affairs, I think that except for a very small number of people who have no political awareness or political activity experience, I am afraid that everyone will recognize that this is another new magic trick by Chongqing to try to regain popular support. In reality, where will they truly respect public opinion and truly prepare to return power to the people? Hang Liwu, a "councilor" who recently returned to Chongqing from a visit to the United Kingdom, in his first public speech, demanded that the Chongqing authorities respect the people's legitimate freedoms and not violate the people's rights to physical integrity, residence, speech, publication, and assembly, which is precisely an indirect accusation of Chongqing's fraudulent policies (because the so-called "councilors" do not have the right to criticize the government). Not only Hang Liwu, but even Chongqing's mouthpiece - the "Central News Agency," at its 20th anniversary celebration, the "president" Xiao Tongzi himself requested that the agency be given the freedom to handle news without violating national laws and party discipline, so as to avoid excessive restrictions hindering its progress, which just tears off the mask of Chongqing's so-called respect for public opinion, promotion of the rule of law, and preparation for constitutional government.</p>
<p>A: Does this mean that the Chongqing regime is facing a dangerous situation where it has no foreign support, has lost prestige at home, and even its own mouthpiece and confidants are rising up in opposition?</p>
<p>B: The only conclusion we can draw today is this. Let us watch the evolution of the facts!</p>
<p>Translator's Comments</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Contradiction Between Attaching Importance to Chongqing and Distrusting Chongqing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nimitz, Stilwell, Marc Mitscher, and other American Pacific War commanders, after invading the Marshall Islands, each published their strategies against Japan, and the basis of their strategies was to cooperate with the Chongqing army. The more the United States expects from Chongqing, the more arrogant and disrespectful Chongqing's attitude becomes, refusing to bow before the United States. If mutual trust collapses, cooperation will not be established. Moreover, the more information comes from the United States demanding Chongqing's cooperation, the more the United States distrusts and is dissatisfied with Chongqing. We dare say that the difficulty of supplying the Chongqing army and the poor quality of the army, in addition to making Nimitz and Mitscher feel difficult in the conduct of operations, also led to the failure of the joint operations of the anti-Axis forces because of the loss of mutual trust.</p>
<p>What the United States expects from Chongqing is the contribution of the Soviet Union on the European front, hoping that Chongqing will also make the same contribution on the Asian front. However, from the American perspective, Chongqing does not have the intention of fully cooperating in carrying out the war. The United States' promise to give Chongqing permanent assistance has two bad effects. First, it makes Chongqing feel that there is no need to exert its greatest efforts; second, it refuses to cooperate with the Chinese Communist Party and does not seek ways to gather all forces. Chiang Kai-shek uses his most elite troops, Hu Zongnan and Chiang Ting-wen's troops, to surround the Communist army like the Great Wall, while neglecting the war against Japan. The United States is extremely angry about this. From the American perspective, no matter how hard the Communist army continues to resist Japan with all its strength, the Chongqing army only stands by and watches, not taking the war to heart. Therefore, the anxious United States even went so far as to advocate supporting the CCP and overthrowing Chongqing.</p>
<p>A recent editorial in "The New Republic" magazine, entitled "The Trouble in East Asia," warned Chongqing by citing the example of Yugoslavia. In Yugoslavia, after Britain and the United States learned that Chetniks were fighting Germany while Mihailović was not, they supported the former and overthrew the latter. This precedent can also be applied to Chongqing.</p>
<p>The United States must defeat Japan, and there is no other way except to obtain a base on the Chinese mainland. As Nimitz stated, Chongqing's full cooperation is required. Anyone who hinders the war effort must be completely eliminated. The magazine said: If Chiang Kai-shek uses American aid and uses the war to attempt to ascend the throne, other methods must be used to suppress him. The so-called "other methods" are probably to stop aiding Chongqing and fully support the CCP. No one can deny that this warning is not authorized by the US government. In the Cairo Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill declared to Chiang Kai-shek that unless he cooperated closely with the CCP, aid to Chongqing would be stopped. This statement is enough to prove the recent news. The United States' distrust of Chongqing has developed into a theory of overthrowing Chongqing. The end of the theory of attaching importance to Chongqing is the theory of overthrowing Chongqing. The foundation of Nimitz's operations collapsed here, and the American dream of victory disappeared like a mirage. (Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, March 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Yesterday, the Supreme National Defense Council Passed a Resolution to Abolish the Ministry of Food; All Management Affairs Will Be Handled by the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. Today (13th), the Supreme National Defense Council held its 45th meeting and resolved on several important cases. Excerpts are as follows: Matters for discussion: The Chairman submitted for discussion a proposal to abolish the Ministry of Food, with all matters under the Ministry's jurisdiction to be handled by the Ministry of Industry. The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion the Executive Yuan's submission of the draft amendments to the Law on the Handling of Labor-Management Disputes, which were passed by the 203rd Yuan meeting and submitted by the Ministry of Social Welfare for review. The resolution was passed in principle and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. The Chairman submitted for discussion a case submitted by the Secretariat approving the Military Affairs Commission's letter on the amendment to the Council's organizational law, which was passed by the Council's 158th standing committee meeting, requesting transfer for review. The resolution was passed with amendments. The Chairman submitted for approval a memorial submitted by Liang, President of the Control Yuan, stating that there were still vacancies for members of the Control Yuan, and proposing Wang Hanliang to fill the position. The resolution was passed. The Chairman submitted for discussion the appointment of Zhao Muru, Huang Qingzhong, Xi Zewen, and Chen Duanzhi as members of the New Life Movement Promotion Committee. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. At the 45th meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the 13th, a resolution was passed to abolish the Ministry of Food, with all matters under the Ministry's jurisdiction to be taken over and handled by the Ministry of Industry. This move is of great significance in strengthening the future of food administration during wartime and is universally valued by all sectors of society. After the National Government returned to Nanjing, stabilizing people's livelihoods was the top priority of governance. Therefore, the first step was to control and manage the food issue, first with the establishment of the Food Management Committee, and then, after formally entering the war, the Food Management Committee was expanded into the Ministry of Food to adapt to the wartime system. In addition to handling the unified purchase and distribution of food, more emphasis was placed on increasing production. The government authorities have made every effort to promote food administration over the years, seeking to smoothly supply the military and the people, which is universally recognized by the people of the country. The authorities' resolute abolition of the Ministry of Food this time and the transfer of all affairs to the Ministry of Industry demonstrates the authorities' further promotion of food administration in the future. At this time of wartime, the simplification of all administration is a necessary measure. Therefore, the abolition of the Ministry of Food this time is the first sign of the government's implementation of administrative simplification. In the future, after the Ministry of Industry takes over food administration, not only can manpower and resources be concentrated, but all powers and responsibilities can also be unified, which is an indispensable factor in promoting administrative efficiency. This shows that the change in the food administration organization, although superficially an abolition, will in fact enhance administrative efficiency. It is believed that under the unified management of the Ministry of Industry authorities, the two major goals of ensuring military supplies and stabilizing people's livelihoods will be achieved under the enthusiastic expectation of all parties.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Major Shimada Explains the Situation in the India-Myanmar War <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 12th. Major Shimada of the Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Army Headquarters met with reporters from the capital yesterday (12th) afternoon at 4 o'clock and explained the situation in the India-Myanmar War and the Pacific War in detail, which lasted for more than an hour. The transcript of Major Shimada's speech is as follows: The entry of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces into India's western border has two meanings: first, the British-Chongqing forces in that area have been driven out; second, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has said that "we want to create India for the Indians." The four main points of the war in India are listed as follows: On the banks of the Fugong River in the north, the Chongqing forces in that area are under the command of American General Stilwell. The Japanese army is currently advancing along the railway towards that area. In the area of ​​Kasa, the enemy forces in that area have had 4,000 paratroopers descend, but this kind of warfare, given the Japanese army's past experience in annihilating small units and the difficulty of supplying the enemy forces in that area, will soon be reduced. In the Imphal area, the war is currently very fierce. The Japanese army is adopting a three-pronged encirclement tactic to attack. The fall of that area is imminent, and the enemy's rear will also suffer a major blow. The Japanese army is currently attacking the Ledo Road and the Moore Road, the forward of Imphal. The Ledo Road is the only lifeline for Chongqing's air and land transportation. If it is cut off, Chongqing will be greatly threatened. On the Kohima front, the Japanese army has achieved military success. The Japanese army is currently advancing along the Ledo and Moore Roads towards Imphal.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Pacific War <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In terms of the Pacific War, the enemy forces hope to end the war in a short period of time. Therefore, they are advancing into the central Pacific, which is a very clear fact. There are three reasons why they hope to end the war in a short period of time: The anti-Axis countries' war effort has failed to achieve its purpose. US productivity has reached its peak. A protracted war will cause war-weariness and other ideas unfavorable to the war to arise in the country. Therefore, the enemy forces hope to end the war in a short period of time. The enemy forces are occupying the small islands of the Pacific one by one, using the island-hopping strategy, which they believe is the key to achieving success in the mainland war. The enemy is eager to obtain air bases on the mainland, so it is expected that bombing of the mainland coast will become increasingly fierce in the future. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing cannot but fight like a cornered beast. As for the islands of New Britain, Bougainville, and New Guinea in the southwestern Pacific, there is currently no fierce war. In short, due to the success achieved by Japan in the India war, its impact on the entire Greater East Asia War situation is very significant.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Central University Implements Military Training <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The National Central University, in view of the extreme importance of student military training during wartime, began to implement strict training on the 10th of last month, and the results were very satisfactory. It is learned that the academic plan for military training is tentatively scheduled for the second semester of the 32nd year, with one semester consisting of ten weeks. The progress will be from basic training to combat training, which will be completed. Intensive training will be provided by personnel sent by the Gendarmerie Command to serve as instructors, and 30 outstanding soldiers selected from the Gendarmerie Training Institute will serve as training squad leaders.</p>

<p>Zhaonan, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to information arriving here: Mountbatten's army, which attempted to recapture Myanmar last year, had its Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in Delhi. It is rumored that the headquarters has recently moved to Ceylon Island.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base on the Indian Front Line, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The enemy forces south of Meilang have now received reinforcements. To cover up the general mobilization of their retreat, they are fiercely resisting with artillery fire, but a unit of the Japanese-Indian army is planning to maneuver around the hills northwest of Meilang to cut off the enemy's retreat route. Another powerful northward-bound unit is luring the enemy to the vicinity of Tairubon, where it is subjected to intense artillery bombardment. The northward-bound Japanese army has occupied a corner of the Imphal Basin and is now threatening a large force on the right flank of the 23rd Division, pursuing it near Meilang on the shores of Lake Loktak. Another vanguard unit of the Japanese army crossed the Leimanan Highlands northwest of Meilang and continued to advance towards a certain area. The final strategic posture of the northward-bound Japanese-Indian army is now complete.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Indian front, the first phase of the mop-up operation in Kohima has now reached its climax. Elite troops of the Japanese-Indian army, in order to respond to friendly forces attacking Assam, have wiped out 5,000 defeated enemy troops in the mountains north and northwest of Kohima. Currently, only about 500 enemy troops (including 100 British) remain in the highlands northwest of Kohima. The enemy forces relied on highland fortresses and artillery positions in the Jotsoma area to mount a stubborn resistance, but elite troops of the Japanese-Indian army launched continuous night attacks on them from the night of the 9th to dawn on the 10th, occupied their fortresses, and gradually narrowed the encirclement. Another powerful unit of the Japanese-Indian army is currently advancing along the Kohima-Dimapur road. The Japanese-Indian army, which started from a certain place eight kilometers northwest of Kohima on the 9th, strongly attacked a certain key point between Kohima and Dimapur via Kadwima, 15 kilometers northwest of Kohima, defeated the enemy garrison, and pursued the enemy forces that fled north along that road.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The Nanjing-Tangshan Highway Begins Operation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Highway Administration Office of the Department of Roads and Bridges of the Ministry of Construction, in order to facilitate land traffic between Nanjing and Tangshan, undertook the construction of the Nanjing-Tangshan Highway. After the project was launched, it was actively carried out by the authorities, sparing no effort. It was completed in full a few days ago and has begun operation. The authorities are now working on the repair of other highways according to the planned schedule. The entire plan for the construction of the highway between Bengbu and Datong has also been drafted, but due to the huge cost, which exceeds the budget by a large amount, it has been temporarily shelved and will be started once funding is available.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Ministry of Social Welfare Convenes a Working Meeting <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Ministry of Social Welfare convened the directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities to Nanjing on the 12th to hold a working meeting. The attendees included Minister Ding Mochun, Vice Minister Xi Zewen, directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities Mao Ziming, Wang Xiwu, Zao Shuqin, Xi Mingqi, Jiang Wenbao, Director of the Shanghai Office Chen Dongbai, as well as Chief Secretary Huang Qingzhong, Director Zhou Yuying, and more than 30 other people. On the morning of the 12th, the directors of social welfare bureaus from various provinces and cities reported on the work situation in their respective regions.

<h3 id="e10">The Yu-Lu-Su War Zone is Officially Dissolved <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to information from here, the Chongqing army formally dissolved the Lu-Su War Zone and the Yu-Lu-Su-Wan Border Region in early March and assigned them to the First War Zone, and appointed Tang Enbo, commander of the Yu-Lu-Su-Wan Border Region, as the commander of the First War Zone. The Lu-Su War Zone army under the command of Yu Xuezhong had suffered repeated defeats due to repeated punitive expeditions by the Japanese army and the Chinese Communist army's struggle for territory. Its morale had long been low. Furthermore, due to the return of generals Wu Huajiao and Rong Ziheng last year and the disintegration of the 89th Army, the relocation of the 79th and 51st Armies, the strength of the army had been greatly reduced. There had been news of the dissolution of the war zone last year. Since the spring of this year, the Chongqing army leaders have reached various agreements with Tang Enbo. As a result, the reorganization in mid-March was used as an opportunity to implement the dissolution of the war zone. Although Chiang Kai-shek's attempt to centralize the old Northeast Army faction, which still maintains its strength in North China, to simplify the command system, it cannot be said that it is a frank expression of reducing the front line to compensate for the decline in combat power. At the same time, it can be said that this move is tantamount to surrendering to the CCP forces in the area. In short, the Chongqing army's overall retreat from the Su-Wan area has brought about the loss of the only base for counter-offensive against Japan in North China.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Rome Will Not Suffer from War; Spain is Negotiating; Herderna Claims to Have a Clue <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a dispatch from Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Herderna told reporters on the 12th that the Spanish government had previously negotiated with the belligerent countries to ensure that the city of Rome would not suffer from the evils of war. Although the situation was satisfactory at the time, negotiations were still needed, and now there is a slight clue. The Pope's worry is the worry of the Spanish people. Therefore, the Spanish government's move is purely based on the hope of Christians, recognizing the privileges of the Vatican and the privileges of the city of Rome, where the Vatican is located.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Chongqing's Coal is Lacking; Many Factories are Shut Down <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. According to a broadcast from Chongqing, most of the small coal mines along the Jialing River have closed down recently due to transportation difficulties and the impact of rising prices. Although the wages of the miners have been increased by the government's adjustment, they still cannot obtain any profit due to the soaring prices. In addition, the coal prices stipulated by the authorities have only increased by 60%, which is not enough to cover the cost, and transportation is also extremely difficult. Therefore, military factories near Chongqing have long felt insufficient capital and materials and have fallen into a state of difficult maintenance. Now, due to the changes in the main supply area of coal, there is really no other way but to close down.</p>

<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Anti-Axis authorities have recently made various speculations about the future operational plans of the German army. The People's Observer published an editorial on the 12th entitled "Waiting Tactics," which stated that the German Supreme Command is actively expanding the reserve army in preparation for future operations. The German army's well-equipped divisions are still taking a waiting stance. German technicians and workers have been engaged in improving weapons for a long time. These reserve combat capabilities and technical capabilities must be seen in future battlefields to see the exertion of their power.</p>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency dispatch, 13th. The Sea Communication Agency's military correspondent, Lieutenant Colonel Ohrberg, said: There is fierce fighting south of Lake Peipsi and on the Crimean front on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Fourth Island Kerran Army is attacking the German positions in Crimea from the east and north. The German army has withdrawn from the Perekop region. The Soviet army is still increasing its troops to attack the West Sidech border and the German army in the city of Korsch after the German army withdrew from the city of Korsch. The Soviet attack on the Nava front has not yet succeeded. The focus of the attack has shifted slightly south, and the fighting is fierce, but they have all been repelled by the German army. The vanguard of the Soviet army that pursued the German army southwest of Odessa has been wiped out. The Soviet army attempted to cross the river in the Akkerman area downstream of the Dniester River, but has not yet succeeded. The Romanian army repelled the Soviet army northwest of Puyasi. The German and Romanian allied forces are holding the highlands at the foot of the Carpathian Mountains. The German army north of Senowitz has made considerable progress in its attack. The German army southeast of Stanislav has surrounded the Soviet army and is rescuing the defenders of Ternopil. The German army in the western part of the city is engaged in fierce street fighting. The German army is advancing east near Broddy and northwest of Kovel. The German army on the line from Stanislav to Kovel has begun a counteroffensive.</p>

<p>Following the authorities' strict crackdown on hoarding and speculation, prices in the city have stabilized. In particular, the Central Bank's tightening of interbank lending and restrictions on financial institutions' lending business have been highly effective in curbing inflation. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank continues to inspect the business accounts of various financial institutions at any time. Those found to be engaged in speculative or hoarding lending activities will be dealt with immediately according to law. According to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, since the Central Bank authorities restricted the lending business of financial institutions, various financial institutions have complied by changing their lending targets. Recently, the loans issued by various banks and firms have all been for the purpose of increasing industrial production, and a portion of the funds has been transferred to rural loans.</p>

<p>National Forum: Cracking Down on Disguised Gambling Dens</p>
<p>The harmful gambling dens were completely closed down on the evening of March 28th, which is a very gratifying event. However, after the gambling dens were closed, I went to Nanshi for a tour and found that there were still many open-air gambling dens near the gambling venues. It is said that these open-air gambling dens only emerged after the gambling venues were closed. The gambling venues were closed on the evening of March 28th, and these temporary gambling dens started operating on the morning of March 29th.</p>
<p>Returning from Nanshi, I walked to the vicinity of the Great World in the old Eighth District and saw "slot machines" still squatting there with their claws out. I don't know if the authorities consider slot machines to be beneficial and harmless? Or are gambling dens allowed to be closed while slot machines are not?</p>
<p>Then I walked to Fuzhou Road and saw people setting up chess stalls in front of the old World Games Bureau, with several accomplices enticing people to bet, with bets of three hundred or five hundred yuan, which is not a small amount of money. However, in broad daylight, how can these gambling stalls be considered less significant than a minor sorcerer compared to a great one? Why don't the authorities prohibit them?</p>
<p>"To cut grass, you must remove the roots, and to eliminate harm, you must be thorough." It is already wrong to prohibit the grand gambling dens while ignoring these "slot machines" and chess stalls. Moreover, allowing small-scale gambling to proliferate around the gambling venues is like chopping down the trunk of a tree while allowing the seeds to spread around. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." Perhaps the future gambling trend will be even worse than in the past! (Qichong)</p>
<p>Municipal Government Announces Protection of Wharf Service Centers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Social Welfare, in view of Shanghai being a major port for trade between China and foreign countries, and the wharves of various ports often being occupied by hooligans and thugs who extort, deceive, and humiliate, has specially ordered the China Social Work Association to organize the Shanghai Wharf Service Center to thoroughly rectify the procedures at all wharves in the city, eliminate long-standing malpractices, improve the welfare of dockworkers, register dockworkers, issue numbers and certificates, and implement management. Anyone without a numbered uniform, armband, or badge is not allowed to enter the wharves to provide services. Since the implementation of the service on March 15th, the order has been greatly improved and travel has become more convenient. However, Shanghai is a city with a mix of people from all walks of life, and the situation at the wharves is complex. It is inevitable that unscrupulous people will spread rumors and seek to issue notices to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Battle Report from the Bougainville Front: Japanese Army and Navy Seize</p>
<p>One morning, when the enemy with a large fleet landed at the western end of New Britain, a member of the naval base unit participating in the counterattack sent a surprising and rare battle report to the reporter. The following is the report:</p>
<p>The enemy preparing to land began large-scale bombing a month before the landing, that is, after November 29th of last year. The daytime bombing occurred five to six times a day, and on the most days, a total of 600 aircraft came back and forth. A certain mountain was the main target of the bombing. Due to the fierce air raids, the shape of the mountain almost changed beyond recognition. The mountain is located in the center, overlooking Bougainville Bay, at an altitude of 200 meters, and can also overlook the west Cape Gloucester to the Dampier Strait. Therefore, it became an important Japanese position. The vegetation on the entire mountain was burned to ashes and turned into a reddish-brown bald mountain. P-38s and small aircraft often patrolled in the air before and after enemy aircraft attacks, flying as low as the forest, conducting opportunistic strafing. Therefore, one could not be careless. If one saw a plume of smoke rising, the area around that place would be completely destroyed, with not a single blade of grass or tree left.</p>
<p>Enemy Landing Under Bombardment</p>
<p>The aircraft day after day were all enemy aircraft, only bombing the support of friendly aircraft. No matter how the enemy aircraft dropped bombs, we continued to repair the airfield at the risk of everything. On December 15th, when the enemy landed at Cape Magas, we already realized that the enemy would carry out a landing directly in front of us.</p>
<p>On December 26th, when the enemy landed, at 3:30 in the middle of the night, we heard a loud sound shaking the earth, and all our soldiers jumped up. This sound was completely different from the sound of ordinary bombs. Soon, the observer reported that it was the bombardment of an enemy cruiser. All soldiers immediately took their positions. The enemy's bombardment seemed to target our base, and it was extremely fierce. The shells exploded nearby, seemingly very close to the coast. Mixed with the sound of exploding shells, machine guns strafed our soldiers. After half an hour, at 4:00 in the morning, General Ming Longjie also gradually understood that about ten to twenty miles off the coastline, there was a black fleet, including transport ships of 10,000 tons and 5,000 tons, about a dozen ships, several escort cruisers, and about ten large destroyers. There seemed to be other fleets at sea as well.</p>
<p>Counterattack Preparations Completed</p>
<p>It could be seen that the enemy fleet was releasing boats one after another. After another half hour to 4:30, about 80 enemy bombers and fighters flew in, and the sky was already very bright. The gun ports of the cruisers and destroyers continued to fire, and under the cover of enemy naval guns and aircraft, the first landing began. The large numbers of troops in the landing craft all headed towards the airfield and the landing points at Cape Gloucester. Several enemy ships came in front of our naval base. We could fire at the landing enemy troops at any time, and we were waiting for an opportunity in our respective positions.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Appearance of Friendly Aircraft</p>
<p>The enemy's first landing ended about five hours after the start of the landing, that is, at 9:40 in the morning. There was fierce gunfire from Cape Gloucester to the west of our base. Because the connection with the army units was cut off, we were in a state of isolation, so we could not know the situation of the battle unfolding. Under naval and air control, the enemy landed in droves. If we had air support, we would never have allowed the enemy to set foot on this island. At 12:30, the second enemy fleet arrived, including several transport ships, several escort cruisers, and several large destroyers. The transport ships anchored in the waters five to ten miles off the eastern coast of Gloucester, with a gap of no more than one thousand meters between the ships. The escort ships patrolled at sea. Behind them were special transport ships with mechanized units for landing, which were about to begin landing, full of tanks, cars, and soldiers. At this moment, a fierce new roar came from the eastern sea. In an instant, we only hoped for the appearance of friendly aircraft. To the east of our position, directly opposite Cape Gloucester, there was a protruding cape. From the opposite side of that cape, a formation of aircraft appeared, the ranks orderly, with a gap of almost one thousand meters between the aircraft, rushing fiercely towards the enemy transport ships. Ah, these are friendly aircraft! The cry came from the members of the machine gun position. Enemy aircraft patrolling in the air and friendly aircraft began a fierce air battle. Our bombers only flew directly at low altitude, advancing towards the target. Before long, two large enemy transport ships were sunk by our aircraft. Then, an enemy ship of 5,000 tons and two enemy ships of 10,000 tons off Cape Gloucester spewed black smoke and sank one after another. At the same time, thousands of enemy soldiers and tens of thousands of tons of equipment that were about to land were annihilated in the depths of Bougainville Bay by the fierce attack of our naval aircraft in an instant. After the transport ships were attacked, the enemy cruisers and destroyers began to bombard our aircraft. In the dark barrage, the enemy ships fled to the sea at full speed. The second formation of our bombers attacked the fleeing enemy fleet. Because of the interference of enemy aircraft and the anti-aircraft fire of enemy ships, our friendly aircraft broke through the fierce fire net and rushed towards the enemy ships. Their appearance was truly "divine." In particular, the bravery of our aircraft that rammed the enemy cruiser and self-detonated was truly commendable. The bomber that rushed towards the enemy ship was hit by a shell, spewing a stream of black smoke. It was seen that the body of the aircraft was on fire, which was dangerous. At the moment of ignition, the aircraft hugged the bomb and crashed into the central part of the enemy ship under the bridge. Dense black smoke and permanent smoke rose together, and the enemy ship finally exploded and sank. In addition, another cruiser lined up next to it also suffered a fatal bomb and sank. Furthermore, three other cruisers and destroyers were also hit by shrapnel, and fled desperately while spewing black smoke. In just fifteen or sixteen minutes since our aircraft began the attack, such a great achievement was achieved.</p>
<p>Controlling Enemy Aircraft and Taking Counteroffensive Measures</p>
<p>All our soldiers watched from their positions. Every time we saw an enemy ship being sunk by our aircraft and making a loud noise, we couldn't help but clap our hands and cheer. In the past few months, we had been threatened by enemy aircraft day and night. Now we could vent our hatred. And bombing the coastline of the enemy landing point, we could see several places rolling up black smoke. While our aircraft controlled the enemy aircraft, the friendly army units on land were a hundred times more courageous, turning from defense to offense, and launching a fierce counterattack against the enemy.</p>
<p>The sound of lively gunfire could be heard in the direction of the enemy landing point. North American-style aircraft crashed in front of our eyes one by one, spewing flames. After our aircraft that had advanced three thousand meters from the coast to the sea flew away, a new batch of enemy aircraft, about one hundred, came again. These enemy aircraft, almost 200 with the previous enemy aircraft, began to frantically attack the friendly army positions near the mountain and the coastline again.</p>
<p>The report of a certain member ended here. In the Battle of Bougainville, our army and navy bravely fought and, although under the control of enemy aircraft, inflicted significant losses on the enemy. Now, we are reorganizing the battle line in the rear. (Translated from the March 15th Asahi Shimbun.)</p>
<p>German and British Methods of Defending Against Air Raids</p>
<p>Since the German Air Force resumed its heavy bombing of London in October of last year, the mutual and retaliatory bombing of cities, centered on the capitals of the British and American armies, has become increasingly fierce. Both armies are doing their best, exhausting human intelligence, and engaging in offense and defense. Due to the emergence of new aircraft and new weapons, there has been significant progress in the offensive. And the defense is also becoming more and more thorough and effective. Here, we will try to introduce one aspect of the recent German and British defense tactics:</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>The greatest strength of British air defense is the air defense mechanism integrating officials and civilians, which was produced from the difficult experience of the London Blitz in the autumn of 1940. As shown in the diagram, the most advanced air defense sensors, such as patrol aircraft, patrol boats, and coastal observation posts (mainly radio wave detectors) on the shores of the Strait of Dover, quickly transmit the "enemy aircraft arrival" warning to the advanced district headquarters. The method is by telegram, telephone, and flare signals. The alarm is transmitted from the advanced district headquarters to the air defense national headquarters - the fighter squadron headquarters - the district committee - the regimental headquarters - and the remote local control bureau. At this time, each unit takes the following steps upon receiving the alarm. That is, the advanced district headquarters informs the advancing fighter squadron, the air defense regimental headquarters informs the barrage balloon team, the fighter squadron headquarters informs the British Air Force Ministry and the air force headquarters, the district committee informs the special task force (including civilian air defense groups) and the bomb disposal team, and the remote local control bureau informs the emergency rescue team, the special task force, the observation posts, and other groups, reports and issues necessary orders. Direct air defense activities are handled by the fighter squadron headquarters, while the district committee and other organizations are responsible for preventing and handling disaster relief work.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>Germany's air defense posture has become more passionate due to the bombing by British and American armies, and it has a much larger air defense mechanism than Britain. Unlike Britain, the distance from the coast to the main defenses of the German mainland is quite long, so its air defense mechanism is also greater and more thorough than Britain's. In addition, the German Air Force's "air fortress" interception tactics are also becoming more and more skillful and effective, as even Britain and the United States themselves admit. In the autumn of last year, when a US bomber squadron based in England raided Schweinfurt, Germany, the US Air Force was shot down by 60 aircraft and was noticeably overshadowed. This major blow was caused by the new weapons and new tactics of Germany shown in the figure. That is, rocket aircraft and "silver paper." To safely and effectively attack enemy territory, bomber squadrons must be organized into tight formations. Rocket aircraft were created to disrupt these formations. Rocket aircraft (some with twin engines, others with four engines, the details of which are unknown) chasing behind the flying "air fortresses" fire rapid-fire shells into the center of the formation. The formation is scattered, and the German fighter aircraft then fly down from above to attack. Another new weapon is "silver paper." German aircraft flying over the US bomber squadron suddenly release Qingbai-colored light, which rolls into a ball. When one of the fragments in this silver paper cloud is reduced, one "air fortress" after another is surrounded by flames and falls down. In addition, rapid-fire shells fired from the ground and new types of aerial time bombs have been very effective for the German army. Regarding "silver paper," it is still a mystery to the US Air Force, which finds it quite a headache. Even in Germany, because it is a secret weapon, it seems that it is not often used thereafter.

<p>Recent Developments in Enemy American Aircraft Manufacturing: Super Heavy Bombers to Appear</p>
<p>The American "Boeing" B-29 long-range bomber, known as the "super-sky fortress," is now gradually entering the stage of large-scale manufacturing. At the beginning of this year, Harry Woodhead, chairman of the board of directors of the Heavy Bomber Manufacturing Company, declared: "The Fort Worth plant in Texas has produced a new type of four-engine super-long-range aircraft and will complete the production of the B-32 aircraft." The enemy American ambitions to use long-range bombers to carry out air raids against Japan are thus becoming concrete. The appearance of the B-29 and the planning of the B-32 can show that the production of enemy American aircraft is moving in the direction of super-giant aircraft. Supplementing the currently used B-17 "air fortresses" and Consolidated B-24s, they are fully engaged in the manufacture of long-range bombers. Since the autumn of last year, providing Gilbert to Nimitz (Commander of the US Pacific Fleet) The offensive entered the bombing stage, attacking Truk, Saipan, Tinian, etc., while strengthening bases in mainland China, attempting to control the Japanese mainland by air. The emergence of heavy bomber groups such as the so-called "super-sky fortress" and "air battleship" is naturally a matter of medical care.</p>
<p>The American Boeing Aircraft Manufacturing Company, famous for manufacturing giant aircraft such as the "Flying Clipper," has been test-manufacturing the "Air Fortress" B-17 since 1936, and has further refined the E and F models with practical experience. The main parts are 15 mm thick main panel armor, and the nose is equipped with five 12.7 mm caliber gun emplacements. A total of about 13 or 14 heavily armed heavy bombers have been completed. However, in the face of the vast Pacific theater, with a maximum speed of 488 kilometers per hour, the US military authorities encouraged domestic long-range bombers with a range of 10,000 kilometers. The Boeing B-29, Consolidated B-32, and Lockheed B-49 aircraft groups were born as a result. The following is an analysis of the B-29.</p>
<p>The Boeing B-29 giant bomber is equipped with four 2,500 horsepower engines, with a total weight of 40 tons, a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a service ceiling of 15,000 meters, and a range of 8,000 kilometers, possessing various advantages. However, according to foreign news reports, this aircraft, which is about to be launched, has a total weight of about 45 to 50 tons. When carrying 8 tons of bombs, it can travel 1,600 kilometers. When carrying 2 tons of combat supplies, it can travel 5,000 kilometers. The cruising speed is slightly less than 8,000 meters in altitude, and the speed is 400 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>The United States after the start of the war has reached the highest level of production technology and theory, but whether it matches Mazer's disregard, after all, because it is equipped with four 2,000 horsepower engines, the range cannot be extended. The currently used long-range bombers want to be equipped with a true ultra-long-range bomber that has not yet been successful. How far it can be actively used in actual warfare is also a question. Moreover, attacking the Japanese mainland from the shores of Midway Island, 4,000 kilometers from Tokyo, is nothing more than a fantasy. (Translated from the March 24th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>The Death of Bai Maozhuqing by Zhu Lin</p>
<p>"Zhuqing committed suicide!"</p>
<p>"Died in Wuxi."</p>
<p>When Jiang Xia told me this on the phone in tears at noon, I was simply shocked.</p>
<p>Just ten days ago, she had left Wuxi with a heartbroken heart to meet a few acquaintances in order to express her life's challenges, but the cruel reality and the powerlessness of her friends only gave her disappointment and sorrow.</p>
<p>It was a quiet farewell, a quiet departure. Who knew that this silent separation would be our eternal farewell?</p>
<p>Two years ago, when Zhuqing was studying at Qing Girls' High School, I was their senior second-grade teacher. The children used their uninhibited enthusiasm and pure ideals to explore their lives. I gained heat and strength from the brave and progressive youth currents, and returned to my own young heart.</p>
<p>The incident lost our school, but the children did not leave me. In my small house, there was still the healthy laughter of the students. In the few months that the school was suspended, my home became the center of the students' gatherings.</p>
<p>In the endless chatting, Zhuqing was the one who attracted my attention the most. A small figure wrapped in a blue cloth jacket, a pair of bright black eyes embedded in a firm face, speaking with the Jiangyin accent at the end of her sentences, she was a good child with clear thinking, quick action, insight, and ideals, and was quite an extraordinary young person among her peers.</p>
<p>With the stability of the situation, the students all found new homes, and Zhuqing also returned to her hometown of Wuxi in February.</p>
<p>The dark society always gives youth only depression. For someone as upright as Zhuqing, she would naturally feel more troubled. Young people all have beautiful dreams, but the reality shows only the ugly dark side. Zhuqing was certainly disappointed in her smog-filled hometown, and the family composed of a stubborn father, a cowardly mother, a doting aunt, and a degenerate brother made her helplessly endure grief and indignation.</p>
<p>She first wrote to me to tell me like this.</p>
<p>"... Auntie is always throwing tantrums, Daddy is always smiling, Mom is sick, Dad is not even willing to pay the medicine bill, Brother is drinking and making trouble all day long, Sister-in-law just hides in the corner and cries. In the world's all-encompassing war, the times are turbulent, but they can't shake the "home" of my tiny self..."</p>
<p>"I can hardly study. Mom is careful under Dad's commands, and finally let her daughter into the school."</p>
<p>"Dad said: 'I'll marry you off after another year of study.' No, never mind her! Take care of the present first!"</p>
<p>Then, I received several issues of the mimeographed literary weekly "Nanguang" that they ran themselves in the countryside. I was so happy, because although it was only a thin mimeographed publication, the design on the opposite side, the layout of the format, the precision of the printing, and the richness of the content all surprised me. The creativity of youth is great. Young people are exploring the road forward themselves. Zhuqing asked me for contributions. I wrote an article "To the Young" and also attached a letter telling her: "Don't be too exposed, otherwise you will encounter difficulties." Sure enough, the letter confirmed my worries, and I never saw "Nanguang" again.</p>
<p>In the half year after summer, Zhuqing gave me many letters, each time heavily revealing her suppressed enthusiasm, and issuing righteous accusations against the suffering reality.</p>
<p>This spring, she was once again ignited by her dormant sense of justice because of the death of her aunt;</p>
<p>"Auntie is sick, she doesn't ask for a doctor or take medicine. She has been back since 'Uncle' abandoned her for more than ten years. Since Grandma died, Dad has never treated her well, and even in her illness, he has never mentioned her once."</p>
<p>"Peng the witch on the street said: 'The ancestral grave is not peaceful, we need to send ghosts.' So, in the noisy sound of sending ghosts, Auntie was sent to the ghost gate."</p>
<p>"Actually, the stingy Dad is not willing to spend money for Auntie. She is a married sister, and she is no longer surnamed ×, so it is not worth spending money to treat her."</p>
<p>"However, the funeral after Auntie's death was handled decently, spending a considerable amount of money. That was to avoid affecting Dad's position and face in the countryside, and also to indulge in the compliments of the guests: 'This old brother really has a conscience.'"</p>
<p>"Isn't the father with "conscience" the real murderer who killed Auntie?"</p>
<p>"So I would rather be a rebellious daughter without conscience, I hate them."</p>
<p>So he began to be uneasy about living in the countryside, and wrote many angry letters asking me to help him leave home.</p>
<p>I wrote back hoping that she would calm down, hoping that she could transform her anger into a deep understanding to help herself understand more and more thoroughly. But perhaps because she was disappointed in me as "such a healthy派" (she called me that in her letter), she stopped sending news for three or four months.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the beginning of July this year that I unexpectedly and excitedly received her letter, discussing with me the matter of applying for a medical school. It turned out that she was about to graduate from middle school.</p>
<p>"In the year or so since returning to the countryside, the painful reality has given me many twists and turns. I have lost my way like a blind person groping in the dark. Sometimes it seems that a spark of fire flashes somewhere, but when I try to grasp it, it hides far away. I think, instead of letting my thoughts collide in the boundless ocean, I should study a specialized skill step by step."</p>
<p>"Therefore, I chose medicine."</p>
<p>"I heard that John's medical school does not accept girls, so please get me a charter from Tongde!"</p>
<p>However, before I had time to reply, a series of express letters flew in one after another, because she discovered that her father was preparing to marry off his daughter.</p>
<p>"Dad never approved of girls going to school. The medical school thing was originally just Mom's soft heart, and she only agreed after the daughter repeatedly begged bitterly. Mom planned for me, saying that even if Dad was unwilling to pay for it, selling jewelry would be enough for me to finish six years of medical school. She has tasted enough of being a "madam" under her husband's tyranny for thirty years."</p>
<p>"But when Dad discovered my preparations for going to school, he said to Mom sternly: 'If you want Zhuqing to go out to study medicine, you take her and get out!'"</p>
<p>"What can Mom do? She has been humiliated for thirty years, can she still fight against her own destiny? What's more, Dad smiled maliciously at me and said: 'To tell you the truth, the Zhao family has already come to propose marriage. This year, I will definitely marry you over.'"</p>
<p>"This was like a death sentence to me, and I trembled."</p>
<p>I was really terrified. Facing such a realistic problem, what help would it be to Zhuqing if I only issued empty theories? Of course, I couldn't bear to see a good child being buried by marriage and ruining her bright future, so I tried to hope that she:</p>
<p>"Never act emotionally, calm down and deal with things calmly. Be considerate to Dad, and in unnecessary occasions, you can appear very gentle. You also have to be kind to your aunt, and get Mom to support yourself in reality. Don't oppose things from the front, just try to delay it for a year or six months, and then slowly strive for further education when the delay is successful."</p>
<p>However, reality is becoming more and more ruthless:</p>
<p>"Mom called the painter to lacquer 'my' buckets and furniture. This means that she has succumbed to me. Dad has recently shown me unprecedented concern and consideration. You will know why that is. The timing is extremely urgent. I heard that the date is at the end of the ninth lunar month."</p>
<p>"Rebel! Leave! But where to go? What about leaving the poor Mom behind? Dad is so stubborn that even running away won't scare him. All that's left is for Mom to suffer. 'Look at the good daughter you gave birth to!'" Obey! I love myself more than everything else. I can't bear to destroy myself to fulfill those who hate me."</p>
<p>"Feigning illness, threats, crying, none of them will have the slightest effect on my father, so one day I spoke of death! But Mom said: 'Let Mom go first!'"</p>
<p>"Mom is definitely not talking nonsense. She has been enduring humiliation for thirty years. Apart from the existence of her only daughter, what does she have to miss? In the teens of years that I have memory, I have seen Mom snatch back her life from the hands of death more than once."</p>
<p>"Only now do I understand why women and tears have an inextricable bond. Mom's tears and my tears flow together. She often trembled when I leaned against her and cried, saying, "Zhuqing! Why didn't you reincarnate as a boy to fight for Mom's dignity?'"</p>
<p>"Now it is really a dead end. The road of life is too narrow. In such a vast amount of time, there is no room for me, a small girl?"</p>
<p>This sad low voice pressed on my chest like a huge stone. I bravely mustered up the courage to find a prerequisite for Zhuqing to leave home—a way to live temporarily. However, the way out is very stingy for the unfortunate.</p>
<p>So, that time ten days ago, she suddenly appeared before my eyes. The pupils sunk deep in her haggard cheeks had lost the hopeful light of the past. The corners of her closed mouth had escaped the laughter that once radiated vitality. The whip of reality was cruelly tormenting a promising youth.</p>
<p>During the few days in Shanghai, we met three times. Most of the time, we were in silence. I didn't say any comforting words. When a person needs factual help, empty words of comfort are deceit to others and a disgrace to oneself.</p>
<p>However, the result of running around again could not give Zhuqing any help. The door to employment is not easy for women to knock open.</p>
<p>Finally, I勉强 agreed with Zhang Ti's opinion to stay in their Xiaxi when necessary.</p>
<p>Zhuqing was about to leave. She had to go home once more before secretly hiding in Xiaxi. I sent her off with heavy worries. On the eve of her departure, I held her hand tightly. Feelings of resentment and guilt blocked the throat of Luwo, and as if sending an innocent lamb to slaughter, I couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>"I'll bring a few classmates to Xiaxi to see you in a few days!"</p>
<p>I managed to blurt out these words. She had already turned her head and got on the bus.</p>
<p>"Write to me: Man can conquer nature. There is always a way."</p>
<p>She turned back and nodded to me.</p>
<p>In this last glance, I only saw a trace of a smile on her pale face.</p>
<p>Like a stream of ice flowing into the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>The memory is so clear, Zhuqing's impression flashes vividly before my eyes, and facing a pile of letters and manuscripts that she meticulously composed with her heart, I cannot believe that a lively and intelligent girl has quietly left her friends, left the world, and will never return to this ugly world.</p>
<p>But, it is absolutely true that she is dead. She was swallowed alive by this cursed society with its blood basin mouth. She was strangled to death by the stubborn and decaying family. I grieve that I have lost a rare student. I lament that the motherland has sacrificed an excellent descendant. I resent that the cloudy era has arranged only tragic fates for the children.</p>
<p>It is not right to praise escaping the painful reality with death, but can I slander Zhuqing with cowardice? When so many people today are confused about the journey of life and need to become walking corpses, Zhuqing's death at least expresses a protest against the times and maintains the integrity of the will to live.</p>
<p>Therefore, I cannot but offer my infinitely respectful condolences to Zhuqing, who is sleeping in the yellow earth.</p>
<p>Rest in peace: Zhuqing: Your the fall of the star will guide our progress.</p>
<p>Reading and Labor by Nilin</p>
<p>I hate those who use reading for entertainment. (Nietzsche)</p>
<p>Holidays call us not to read textbooks from school, but to read the greater society. (Schumann)</p>
<p>Regarding books, I have only one thing to say, that is, reading is not the main part of learning. (Locke)</p>
<p>To believe everything written in books is worse than having no books at all. (Ancient Chinese proverb)</p>
<p>If anyone wants to read good books, they should avoid bad books. (Schopenhauer)</p>
<p>I have read many bad books. Bad things, like good things, must be known practically and correctly. (Gorky)</p>
<p>Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested. (Bacon)</p>
<p>The matter of reading is by no means the same as so-called diligence, just as the matter of taking a walk is not necessarily rest. The true meaning of reading lies in how we read. (Tsurumi Yusuke)</p>
<p>Kites by Lan</p>
<p>It is spring, and there is already a feeling of warm spring. But it is not less stinging the wind, it should be the southeast wind, not feeling too cold. If you are lonely, walk on the street, stroll in the warm sunshine, and look up at the azure sky, then, one by one, kites appear in your eyes, and it makes you clearly feel that it is spring.</p>
<p>Relying on a little bit of intelligence, relying on a little bit of physical action, some paper, some bamboo layers, and a little paste, some strange birds and beasts are made. Children who have no fortune to receive education, God has given them this clever skill. Simple little souls! Protecting this temperament, there should be even greater success and inventions.</p>
<p>The kite on a weak and thin line, no matter how the wind can exert all its force to persecute and destroy it, is like a martyr of the professional art with a spirit of sacrifice, to complete the last stroke in a natural picture book, unyielding to soar straight into the clouds, so as not to fail to fulfill its due mission: This page is the best life symbol to describe life, spring should be the most proud time, the success of personal career, although it is said to have a satisfactory environment, but inevitably there are unexpected twists and turns, how much ability is needed in this question; How much talent is needed to display in this question: not afraid of setbacks, not afraid of failure, not worried about whether you will succeed, only worried about whether you can work hard. Then, you can steadily get a flat ladder, and soar straight into the clouds.</p>
<p>Often, when a kite is released into the clouds, it is no longer subject to any restraint, as if it is asking for a final liberation, and finally, it flies away with the wind! I feel that a person's career, position, and reputation should come to a halt at a certain period of time, so that they can reflect on themselves and not fall into a state of arrogance and extravagance. In this way, one can still preserve the original self, without seeking perfection, without seeking destruction, and the doctrine of the mean should have the value of preservation.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Economic Security Office Officially Established Yesterday; Deputy Directors Su and Du Issue Statements <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city was officially established yesterday (the 13th). A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Deputy Director Su Chengde yesterday, who issued a statement regarding the establishment of the Economic Security Office, stating: "In order to adapt to the needs of the situation, this Bureau, after careful consideration and meticulous organization, formally established the Economic Security Office today (the 13th). In the past, there were three units in this city responsible for economic management: the Economic Bureau, the Economic Section, and the Economic Division of this Bureau. In the future, they will be unified. The Economic Bureau will be responsible for economic administrative matters, and the Economic Security Office will be responsible for economic investigation and enforcement, cracking down on illegal economic activities such as materials, prices, and finance. The sole purpose is to balance prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. A country should have an economic management agency to handle national economic administration, and allied advanced countries have long established such economic institutions. In a wartime state, Shanghai is an indicator of prices in four provinces and two cities, so the establishment of the Economic Security Office is a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>Strictly Investigate Economic Crimes</p>
<p>Now that it has been established, we will implement strict measures to thoroughly investigate economic crimes. Anyone who commits illegal economic crimes, regardless of their status, will be severely punished. Regarding personnel, after careful consideration, we are very pleased to have Mr. Wu Dao Mao and Yao Yunbo appointed as directors. Both have considerable experience and are very dedicated. In particular, Mr. Wu Dao Mao has been working with allied countries and relevant authorities and has made many contributions to the establishment of the Economic Security Office. I believe that under their leadership, we will not disappoint the public. At the same time, I hope that all citizens will assist us at any time and report illegal merchants. I also hope that knowledgeable people in society will supervise us. I believe that with the cooperation of officials and civilians, Shanghai's wartime economic situation will be brought back on track, and people's livelihoods will be stabilized."</p>
<p>Public Service, Law-Abiding, and Integrity in Policing</p>
<p>The Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city was officially established yesterday. Senior officials above the section chief level paid respects to Deputy Directors Du Zhengjian and Su Chengde yesterday morning, who gave them instructions. Du Zhengjian said in his instructions: "You are responsible for the important task of economic security and must strive to stabilize people's livelihoods at all times. You must also serve the public honestly, abide by the law, and maintain integrity in policing. Clearly identify goals, focus on facts, and never distort right and wrong. Your actions must be in accordance with public opinion. Although public opinion may not always be perfect, you must adhere to the principle of adopting public opinion."</p>

<p>To commemorate the Amritsar massacre 25 years ago and to praise the glorious victories of the Indian National Army, which entered India together with the Japanese army, the Indian community in Shanghai solemnly held an Indian mass meeting at the Yokohama Bridge Youth Hall at 2:00 p.m. yesterday (the 13th). After the meeting began, they first paid respectful silent tribute to the war dead of Japan and the Indian National Army. Then, Mr. Bao Bi, Liaison Minister of the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League, gave a speech, encouraging the Indian people to be determined to achieve independence. The gist of his speech was as follows: Twenty-five years ago, in Punjab and Amritsar, a rare historical incident of British humiliation of Indians occurred. This is a fact that the Indian people will never forget. The time for revenge has now come. The key to defeating the British is in the hands of our leader, Jiangtela Bose. At the same time, we cannot forget Japan's material and spiritual assistance. The realization of permanent peace in East Asia will certainly not be possible if British forces remain in India. We must rise up together and drive out the Anglo-Saxons.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Aircraft Donation Committee Issues Letter to Citizens <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since the launch of the aircraft donation campaign in this city, various circles have responded enthusiastically and donated generously. It is understood that the Citizens' Aircraft Donation Committee of this city has specially printed an article entitled "The Aircraft Donation Campaign and the Responsibilities of Citizens" to inform the citizens, and the full text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fulfilling the Responsibilities of Citizens</p>
<p>National prosperity and decline are the responsibility of every citizen, which refers to every individual citizen, because the nation and the citizens are closely related. A nation without citizens is not a nation, and a citizen without a nation cannot be considered a citizen. Especially when the nation is at a critical juncture of survival, every citizen must do their best to shoulder the responsibility of defending the nation! What time is it for China now? Has it reached a critical moment of survival? In the Greater East Asia War, our China has already declared war. Generally, a country that participates in a war not only declares war in words, but must contribute the strength of every citizen to the government to assist the government in the war. This is considered fulfilling the responsibilities of a citizen! The aircraft donation campaign is fulfilling the responsibilities of citizens and is also a manifestation of patriotism. The strength of a nation lies entirely in the enthusiasm and strength of the people. The nation is the entire group of people. Every citizen must clearly recognize their obligations and responsibilities and work hard to shoulder them in their respective positions. No one can shirk this duty. A nation with strength can of course be strong. If citizens abandon their responsibilities in their positions, then the nation's strength will gradually weaken, and the fate and property of the citizens will fall into a tragic situation.</p>
<p>Striving for Victory with All Efforts</p>
<p>Recently, there are still some people who cannot clearly recognize their responsibilities and obligations, and of course cannot contribute to the nation as much as possible. Their hopes and slogans are nothing more than "independence and autonomy" and "freedom and equality." They think this is patriotism, but in fact this attitude is not only useless to the nation, but simply misleading the nation. May I ask, who should bear the responsibility for the nation's prosperity and revival? How can friendly nation Japan be a world power? Invincible in every battle, not only is its equipment superior, but the first thing is the unity of the national mindset, the widespread and enthusiastic patriotism, and every citizen is willing to contribute to the nation at all costs, willing to suffer themselves, then of course there is a way to strive for victory. Not only can it strive for victory, but it can also support other countries in East Asia to strive for independence and liberation. Now that the Greater East Asia War has reached the final decisive stage, since our China is a participating country, we of course have a common responsibility for striving for victory.</p>
<p>Protecting the Rear Base</p>
<p>At this critical moment of national construction, it is absolutely not allowed for every citizen to stand aside and watch, while the armed comrades of friendly nations are gloriously killing enemies on the front lines. We should protect the rear. The Shanghai area is the most important base in the rear. In today's military, the power of the air force is unpredictable, and a state of war can occur at any time, regardless of the rear or the front. I hope that the people of Shanghai will make practical donations to the aircraft donation campaign, and stop hesitating. Planning for the nation is planning for yourself. Even if you don't think about winning the Greater East Asia War, you should think about strengthening national defense, or think about preserving your own life and property. You must know that our government will never allow any citizen residing in Shanghai to stand aside and watch during this wartime period. The aircraft donation campaign is a way for every citizen to express their patriotic thoughts, exert their individual strength, and contribute their entire strength to the nation to complete the Greater East Asia War with "final victory."</p>
<h3 id="e34">Various Trade Associations Establish Mediation Committees to Handle Black Market Disputes <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the authorities' rapid progress in the investigation work has posed a serious threat to general speculative merchants. They are eager to lower the prices of long-stocked goods for sale, and even refuse to accept goods purchased on the black market in the past. As a result, disputes have arisen one after another, and the situation is quite embarrassing. They are now successively requesting their respective trade associations to take into account the welfare of their fellow traders, and to send personnel as soon as possible to impartially mediate the situation in order to achieve a satisfactory solution. However, each trade association only accepts mediation for its own trade members, and at the same time conducts a detailed review of the requests made by members in order to find a solution. It is understood that each trade association has separately established a "Mediation Committee" in order to be dedicated to the job. As soon as it receives a letter requesting mediation from a fellow trader, it will review each of the points raised and then notify each of the fellow trade members to attend the meeting on the specified date. Responsible persons will then be appointed to impartially mediate the situation. After both parties' representatives approve, the mediation record will be signed and the association will issue an execution order. However, in addition to all directors and supervisors being ex-officio members, each trade association's Mediation Committee will also hire experienced people from the industry to participate in order to achieve perfection.</p>

<p>Since the official opening of the South City Special Consumption Tax Collection Office, the tax revenue in the entire district has been extremely strong. The office yesterday ordered all its personnel to restrain themselves and not to arbitrarily inspect businesses and other entities on the pretext, causing harassment incidents. Otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law.</p>
