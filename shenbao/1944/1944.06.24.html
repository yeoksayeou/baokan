<h3>社評　愼用縣長官</h3>
<p>最近中樞當局對於地方行政之革新，逐漸實施。前有省行政機構之合併調整，近復有縣行政改革方案之擬定。地方行政機構之調整以及行政官東職權地位之提高，固極重要，而行政官吏之人選銓衡尤為重要。如果人選不當，則機構調整仍無實效，而職權地在　衡省政長官人選之時，必須為全省人民利益著想，除學識經驗以外，尤須注重操守廉潔。過去袛為一己一派之私，罔顧全省人民之痛苦者，萬萬不可輕易任命。至於縣長</p>
<p>從前某省對於任用縣長的人選，提出三個前提條件：「一支筆，一張嘴，一雙腿」，一支筆可以下筆千言，傳僥民衆，草擬計劃，有條不穩。一張嘴可以口若懸河，說服民衆，會議辯論，侃侃發言。一雙腿可以步行百里，深入民間，登山涉水，以赴事機。什麽？人民所不需要者是什麽？怎樣做是人民所不能接受的？怎樣做是人民所能夠接受的？一一都能瞭如指掌，成竹在胸。於是，對於上級政府的政令，認為推行時有所窒礙者，可以建議修正；認為推行時無所窒礙者，可以獲順利成效。一方面，縣長能深切體騐人民疾苦，凡百措施，在在為人民利益打算，那末，人民對於這個縣長當然也會發生信仰與愛護。萬一遇到中央爲實現某種政策而必須人民增重負擔時，經縣長對人民　解曉喻，不難使人民勉力接受了。</p>
<p>所以，縣長人選之適當與否？對於地方政治之良　，關係至鉅。目前和平區內，各縣縣長之委任，能取人才主義者，並不多見。大率遷統當地具有潛勢力者充任縣長，或不學無術之單，　祿鎭營。遂致地方政治不上軌道，民生疾苦愈益加深。此於改革縣行政之際，霄應注意之問題。</p>
<p>其次，一部分粗曉日語之通譯人員，藉與盟邦各地常局接觸之便利，經盟邦當局之推　，擔任縣長。若帶並無政治學織興行政經騐，而共目的又不正常，一旦走馬上任，更是狐假虎威，氣燄萬丈，人民所受痛苦之深，可以概見。</p>
<p>現在政府當局旣經決定改革整行政方案，且將强化並統一縣政，集中事權於縣長，及提高縣長地位，是則今後對於縣長之責任益見重大，因此，縣長人選之　衡尤應，愼重，不論任何方面推舉保　，均應由中央嚴格甄選，即省縣政府各級佐治人員，亦須一律經過嚴格甄選，以符用人唯才之旨。不合標準，絕不勉强任用。以期地方政治，因各級官吏人選之得當，而收革新之實效。</p>

        <h1>1944.06.24</h1>
<h3>Mariana Sea Area: Japanese Fleet Achieves Great Victory; Sinks or Destroys Six Enemy Warships and Over a Hundred Aircraft [F] Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 23rd that a portion of the Japanese Combined Fleet, on the 19th, in the western sea area of the Mariana Islands, surrounded an enemy mobile unit composed of three fleets and launched a preemptive attack. By the 20th, they had sunk or destroyed five enemy aircraft carriers and one or more battleships, and shot down over a hundred enemy aircraft. In this battle, the Japanese side lost one aircraft carrier, two auxiliary oil tankers, and fifty aircraft.</h3>
<p>Kurihara Colonel's Remarks Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Kurihara Colonel, head of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, recently made a statement regarding the situation on Saipan Island. He stated that the scale of the battle around Saipan Island is unprecedented since the start of the war. The enemy's intentions, use of forces, and intensity of fighting spirit are also unique since the beginning of the war. If the enemy establishes a strong air force base on Saipan Island, it will have a significant impact on control of the sea and air in the Western Pacific. Therefore, the Japanese side is mobilizing mobile units, air force units, and fleets in that area to launch attacks against the invading enemy. The enemy's forces in that area include over twenty aircraft carriers and over ten battleships, forming a large mobile unit. On June 11th, they appeared off Saipan Island with over a hundred transport ships, turning Saipan Island into a battlefield. Since the 15th, two enemy divisions have landed on Saipan Island, intensifying the war on both the sea and land fronts. The Japanese mobile unit engaged the main enemy fleet on the 19th, launching a preemptive attack. The damage inflicted on the enemy as of the 23rd is substantial, as announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. However, compared to the enemy forces that invaded this time, the enemy's losses are only a part of their overall strength and cannot determine the outcome of the war. Therefore, in the future, it will be necessary to thoroughly eliminate the invading enemy with all sea, land, and air forces in that area. The entire Japanese nation and the world will pay close attention to the developments in that area. Frontline soldiers in that area and in various southern regions, such as the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Solomon Islands, and New Guinea, are closely monitoring enemy actions. The battle on Saipan Island is a difficult situation for the enemy. This difficulty can be understood from the battle reports in that area. Every time we receive reports of the Japanese army's frontline commanders (brave warriors), it greatly increases our excitement and encouragement.</p>
<p>Matsushima Department Head's Remarks Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatches The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced yesterday that the U.S. mobile unit around the Mariana Islands is under close surveillance by the Japanese Combined Fleet. Now, the Japanese military, with battle opportunities ripe, resolutely dispatched a portion of its fleet to break into the enemy fleet, demonstrating past bravery, and after two days of fierce fighting, defeated the enemy. At a time when the world is focused on the Pacific war situation, the announcement of the Mariana battle has caused amazement among Chinese and foreigners here. Colonel Matsushima, head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, recently made a statement on this matter, saying: The Japanese Navy, with its complete strategic posture, consistently carries out independent operations, repeatedly catching the enemy by surprise and causing them to rush around exhaustedly. With battle opportunities ripe, on June 19th, a portion of the Combined Fleet intercepted the enemy mobile unit in the waters west of the Mariana Islands. After two days of fierce fighting, yesterday, the General Headquarters announced that it had sunk five aircraft carriers, one battleship, and shot down over one hundred aircraft. This naval battle is likely to be the most elite operation of both armies. The damage suffered by both sides can be estimated from this, but because the enemy retreated, they were not given a thorough beating. Combining the results of the battle in the Mariana area since June 12th, the enemy warships sunk and destroyed include more than four battleships, more than nine aircraft carriers, six cruisers, one destroyer, one submarine, six transport ships, and one ship of unknown type. More than four hundred aircraft were shot down, which can be described as a great victory since the Battle of Hawaii. However, one point is particularly noteworthy: it is too early to say that this naval battle is the end of the decisive battle. In the future, the enemy may repeatedly attack with its remaining forces. Currently, the enemy is still propagating that there are about one hundred aircraft carriers operating in the Pacific, which is naturally a smokescreen for the enemy's attempts to cover up their defeat. However, this point shows that the enemy harbors the intention to counterattack in the Central Pacific.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a recent report in the New York Times, a well-informed source in American military affairs stated that the propaganda of American planes bombing the Japanese mainland from mainland China has caused great unease in Chongqing, because the Japanese army will therefore exert more pressure on Chongqing. The United States is not very clear about this psychology in Chongqing. From this, we can see that the United States is unwilling to let Chongqing sacrifice to the end in everything, and its goal is to turn Chinese territory into a battlefield.</p>
<p>Japanese Naval Forces Cooperate in Fierce Fighting in Hunan After the start of operations in Hunan, Japanese naval units in China maintained close contact with the army units, bravely carrying out their missions and currently ensuring the smooth progress of the war. The situation of cooperation with army units up to the fall of Yingtain, a key point in the Ninth War Zone, is as follows: In early May, a powerful unit that had been organized, departed from the 〇〇 base together with the army, and took the lead in carrying out sweeping operations in the Yuezhou and Leishi Mountain areas. The enemy had set up about twenty or more underwater mines and obstacle facilities under Leishi Mountain. Disregarding the great danger, the Japanese forces cleared them, rushed to the foot of Leishi Mountain, and continued their attack. When traveling up the Mishui River, they fought with the U.S. aircraft that were fiercely attacking the Gaoshan area, repelling them. Despite the bombing, they resolutely cooperated with the army's boats to travel upstream, capturing and thoroughly annihilating the defeated enemy near Pingjiang. When the Japanese army advanced to the vicinity of the upper reaches of the Hebo River, twelve enemy P-40 aircraft attacked again, but after the Japanese army responded bravely, they quickly fled. In early June, operations towards Xinshi began, and the 〇〇 unit successfully landed near Yingtain. Prior to this, the Chongqing army, entrenched in the lower reaches of Yingtain, in order to stop the Japanese army's momentum of rapid advance, either set up numerous machine guns on the river or used obstacles to fortify their defenses, and launched fierce attacks. The Japanese army continued its brave advance, carrying out sweeping operations near Xiapiaolao, and silenced the attack of the Chongqing army in the Qingshan area. On the morning of June 6, they captured Yingtain. After learning that Yingtain had fallen, the Chongqing army attempted to harass everywhere, and the offensive also strengthened in response to this. Especially when opening the waterway from Yingtain to Lugong Temple, eleven or eight P-40 aircraft attacked the sweeping unit, causing them to fall into a bitter battle, but they finally repelled them with artillery fire, and the operation progressed according to the planned procedure, removing the strong obstacles and minefields in front of Yingtain, advancing to Xiangyin, and continuing to expand the battle results. Since the sweeping unit of the Japanese army's upstream operation in the Yangtze River in 1937, due to the ardent operations and the use of new weapons, it skillfully cleared numerous obstacles. However, the situation is different now. The Chongqing army is stubbornly resisting on both sides of the river, and there are frequent air raids by the so-called U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing, making the difficulties even greater. However, the morale of the sharp soldiers is increasing, and they are not allowing the army to lose a single soldier on the water, completing the actual results of cooperation, and unfolding a vivid model of sea-land cooperation in various places. According to reports, more than 600 mines and nearly 300 obstacles have been cleared in this area, and the damage to the Japanese army is extremely slight. Furthermore, when the Japanese naval unit advanced to Jingjiang on June 17, the Chongqing army attacked with a formation of 34 fighters and bombers, but they were repelled. When searching for enemy aircraft shot down by friendly forces, they engaged dozens of defeated soldiers and annihilated them. They are currently continuing to advance in cooperation with the army. The Japanese army will advance to Pingxiang (about 30 kilometers south of Liling). "Hunan Battle Line" Japanese Telegram From the Pinghan Line, the army advanced westward and broke into Shangshui on the night of the 18th (about 200 kilometers southeast of Ezhou). Most recently, the Japanese army broke into Zhoujiakou (north of Shangshui), and street fighting is underway.</p>
<p>Luoyang, June 23rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese army's elite troops, with the Chongqing army's 89th Division, 4th Division, and Provisional 16th Division under Tang Enbo, attempted to recapture Luoyang County, and began attacking in early June, launching an annihilation battle in the southwest of the county. After three strong attacks by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army's attempt was crushed. The comprehensive results of the Japanese army are recorded as follows: 1,351 bodies abandoned, 164 prisoners, and many seized supplies.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Mountainous Area of Southern Hunan Japanese Army Attempts to Encircle Hengyang Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to a Reuters correspondent in Chongqing, the situation in Hunan is as follows: The Japanese army advanced southward along the Yuehan Railway from Changsha and is currently engaged in large-scale battles with the Chongqing army in the mountainous area of southern Hunan. The Japanese army is currently attempting to encircle Chongyang (a major air base in southern Hunan) in three routes. The Japanese army closest to Chongyang is currently advancing south along the Yuehan Railway. This unit is approaching Shiwan (northeast of Chongyang), a distance of 48 kilometers from Chongyang. The railway is entirely mixed gauge, and the road is also divided into upper and lower tiers. Another Japanese army advancing west of the Yuehan Railway occupied Xiangxiang on the 21st. This unit is now encircling Hengyang from the west and has moved to the outside of the western side of the Weishan Mountains. Another Japanese army, intending to encircle Hengyang from the east, is advancing from Liling along the eastern road of the Yuehan Line towards You County and has now reached Sifen (south of Liling). A portion of the army on the land is currently advancing east along the forced road towards Pingxiang (a coal and iron ore producing area in the border area of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces).</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Military Affairs Bureau announced the situation in Henan and Hunan on the 22nd as follows: "Hunan battles" have engaged in close-range combat in the Sifen area south of Liling.</p>
<p>The Moment a Mine Explodes: Japanese Navy Severely Damages Enemy Aircraft in the Indian Ocean Penang, 23rd (Central News Agency) More than thirty enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked Port Blair in the Andaman Islands on the morning of the 21st. The Japanese units stationed there shot down six and destroyed four of them. One Japanese small boat was bombed and caught fire.</p>
<p>Japanese Scientific Circles Announce New Weapons Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Japanese scientific circles are engaged in a life-and-death battle with American scientific circles, working tirelessly and dedicating themselves to the invention of new weapons. Last May, when the U.S. military attacked Attu Island, the Japanese army carried out accurate artillery fire on the U.S. military in the thick fog, which can be attributed to the efforts of the Japanese scientific circles. Colonel Hanada, head of the technical research mobilization section of the Japanese Navy, said that at this time, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of aircraft, because aircraft are changing rapidly, so basic research and its application cannot be delayed for a single day. Japan is currently working together with military officials and civilians to conduct research. Regarding the situation of aviation research, the so-called comprehensive organization of Japanese aviation technology has emerged, and specialized research institutes have also been established one after another, and their effectiveness is being reported daily. Manufacturing aircraft is a comprehensive industry, and each department must conduct precise research. Japan's new organization for aviation research can complete its mission without regret.</p>
<p>Japanese Government Promotes Increased Mineral Production Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Since 1941, the Japanese government has formulated periods for increased production of important minerals every year, and this year it was decided to implement them in August and September. The outline was formally decided at the vice-ministerial meeting on the 22nd. Iron, copper, zinc, mercury, manganese, barite, and lead are all basic mineral materials for various important weapons, military supplies, and production materials, and are indispensable for enhancing combat power. As the war situation gradually intensifies, it is necessary to rapidly increase production. Therefore, a period for increased production of important minerals is specially formulated to advance towards rapidly breaking through the production goals of the extraordinary period. During this period, special measures will be requested for the following points: Ensure labor force and fully utilize diligence, Ensure raw materials, operating supplies, and essential living materials, Strengthen special transportation of ore and raw materials, Recognize and commend those who have made outstanding contributions to good mine workers and related personnel.</p>
<p>Meeting of Finance Ministers of Japanese Southern Military Administration Areas Shonan, 23rd (Central News Agency) The first meeting of finance ministers of the Japanese Southern Military Administration Areas for this year was held on the 22nd at the Shonan Military Administration Department. The meeting preliminarily passed a comprehensive low-price policy, which is based on the points of operation and military administration, including actively absorbing capital, suppressing capital outflow, and rapidly producing war materials.</p>

<p>Maintain Supply and Demand Balance: Increase Issuance of 500 Yuan Savings Bonds; Severely Punish Profiteers Who Raise Prices Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) The National Government ordered on June 23, 1944, that Article 19 of the Central Reserve Bank Law be amended and promulgated. This order is attached to Article 19: The Central Reserve Bank shall issue exchange notes in seven denominations: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, one hundred yuan, two hundred yuan, and five hundred yuan, and may issue decimal auxiliary coin exchange notes. This Dispatch The Central Reserve Bank, in order to meet the needs of merchants and adjust the balance of funds, has issued a new edition of the ochre 500 yuan note, which will be circulated in the market from today. The announcement is as follows: From today, the Bank will issue a new edition of the ochre 500 yuan note, with a portrait of the founding father of the Republic on the front, red note numbers printed on the upper left and right, and the seal of the president and vice president of the Bank printed at the bottom. The back is printed with an image of the mausoleum of the founding father of the Republic, with the signatures of the president and vice president of the Bank in Western characters at the bottom. This ochre 500 yuan note is universally valid with all types of banknotes already issued by the Bank.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) Since its establishment, the Central Reserve Bank has shouldered the mission of a national bank, striving to develop the economy, consolidate finance, and enrich the people's livelihood. The expansion of the financial network, in addition to the head office in the capital, has seen the establishment of branches or offices throughout the country. The government has granted the bank special issuance rights. In accordance with the law, it has issued one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan banknotes, which are used for all public and private economic activities, market financial circulation, such as tax revenue, government expenditures, and other commercial transactions. It has already achieved great results in financial circulation, industrial and commercial prosperity, and agricultural production, laying a solid foundation for the entire economic recovery of China. Shanghai's banking and money industries believe that now is the peak season for agricultural products from various regions to enter the market. Shanghai businesses need a large amount of cash to purchase wheat, silk cocoons, and other goods from other places. However, the cash reserves in the market are not abundant, and large denominations are particularly lacking. Therefore, acceptance and delivery are cumbersome, and transportation and remittance are inconvenient. Therefore, they specially submitted a document to the Central Reserve Bank, requesting consideration of the supply and demand situation, and to expand the denomination of the banknotes to facilitate adjustment. After considering the matter, the financial authorities believe that in order to achieve a balance between supply and demand, it is indeed necessary to issue large-denomination currency, and decided that the Central Reserve Bank will issue 500 yuan notes. The development of commerce will gain greater convenience, and it is firmly believed that it will also become more active in consolidating finance, enriching the people's livelihood, inspiring national strength, and applying wartime economic operations. It is believed that it will inevitably become more active. It can be asserted that the main purpose of this issuance of large-denomination banknotes is to adjust market finance and maintain a balance between supply and demand, so its benefits to the prosperity of industry and commerce, and even the entire economy, will be many. There are two things that we earnestly hope for here: First, the people should have a deep understanding of the purpose and effect of the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of large-denomination notes, and should know that it is by no means the result of malignant inflation. Second, after the issuance of large-denomination notes, some profiteers will inevitably take advantage of this opportunity to raise prices. It is hoped that the authorities will pre-plan effective countermeasures. First, strictly punish those who take the opportunity to spread rumors and confuse public opinion. Second, resolutely punish profiteers who take the opportunity to raise prices. Then, the authorities' intention to stabilize the people's livelihood will be clear, and the plans of ignorant villains can be defeated without attacking.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) Regarding the Central Reserve Bank's issuance of 500 yuan notes, Finance Minister Zhou has made a statement. The statement of Finance Minister Zhou and the original letter from the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association to the Ministry of Finance, regarding the request to increase the issuance of large denominations, are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Finance Minister Zhou Specially Issues a Statement "Since the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the government has granted it the right to issue currency, and in accordance with the law, has issued one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan exchange notes as the only currency. All public and private economic uses, such as tax revenue, government expenditures, and transactions and payments by other businesses, and the circulation of market finance, are mediated by it, promoting industrial and commercial prosperity, agricultural production, and economic recovery. The business of the Central Reserve Bank has also developed rapidly with the general trend of progress. Whether in urban or rural areas, the demand for Central Reserve Bank notes is increasing daily. According to a recent letter from the Shanghai Banking and Money Industry Association, Shanghai businesses need a large amount of cash to purchase wheat, silk cocoons, and other goods from other places. Considering the supply and demand situation, how should the denomination of banknotes be expanded to facilitate adjustment, etc. It is clear that the need for cash and the expansion of the denomination of banknotes have become urgent. Moreover, this year's wheat and silk harvests are abundant, and the wheat production in the Huaihai region is greater than in the Yangtze River basin. In the past, the Huaihai region used the Joint Savings Bank notes, but now it has switched to the Central Reserve Bank notes. However, because of the denomination of the banknotes, it is still difficult to match them. Therefore, all sectors of the Huaihai region hope to have Central Reserve Bank notes with a denomination similar to the 100 yuan notes of the Joint Savings Bank to cope with the situation. After repeated and careful consideration by the government, and in view of the hopes of all sectors, the injection of rural economy, and the adjustment of market funds, it was decided to adopt a discretionary approach. The Central Reserve Bank will issue a 500 yuan note to adapt to the balance of all supply and demand. It is expected that finance and economy will become more convenient in the future. The government and the Central Reserve Bank will continue to follow the past financial policies to make it sound and strong, so as to develop national power, and the application of wartime economy can become more active."</p>
<p>Letter from the Central Reserve Bank to the Ministry of Finance "Central Reserve Bank Official Letter, General Dispatch No. 1392. According to a letter from the Shanghai Special City Money and Banking Industry Association, 'It is found that the agricultural products in various places are now in the peak season for entering the market. Shanghai businesses need a large amount of cash to purchase wheat, silk cocoons, and other materials from other places. However, the cash reserves in the market have been insufficient recently, and large denominations are particularly lacking. The acceptance and delivery are cumbersome, and the transportation and remittance are even more inconvenient. In fact, the need for large denominations is becoming more urgent. Therefore, we hereby submit a letter stating the actual situation, please consider the actual situation of the supply and demand of cash in the market, and how to expand the denomination of banknotes to facilitate adjustment and enrich turnover,' etc. This matter concerns the national currency issue and should be referred to your department for consideration and reply. This is directed to the Ministry of Finance."</p>
<p>Construction Department Reports on Administration Overview Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Construction held a regular meeting with Chinese and foreign journalists at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 23rd) to report on the recent administrative overview of the Ministry. The records are as follows: (A) Pre-allocation of flood control subsidy funds. In order to strive for thorough flood control, the Ministry intends to temporarily allocate the flood control funds to the provinces and cities this year before the flood season, totaling 2 million yuan, in order to prepare materials early and facilitate flood control. (B) Spring repairs of the canal dikes in northern Jiangsu. (C) Inspect the situation of the Jiangpu dam and sluice gates. (D) In order to increase production, temporarily restrict water supply. The source of chemical drugs for water purification is lacking, and it is now the summer season, and water consumption is even greater. For the sake of increasing production, purely consumers will be stopped from receiving water, and the rest will temporarily reduce the water supply to 75% of the highest monthly water consumption in the past. (E) Regarding the improvement of highways. The section from Shangmei Road trestle bridge to Wangbang was previously requested by the Ministry to the Shanghai Municipal Government to order repairs. The repairs have now been completed. The Jingju Highway and the Yangliu Highway have been damaged for many years and urgently need repair. The Ministry has allocated subsidies separately to order the relevant county governments to rush repairs, and they should be completed in the near future. (F) Comprehensive implementation of road protection team member training and education, and allocation of welfare services. In order to enable road protection team members to understand the concept of road protection and be proficient in necessary skills, the training and education work will be implemented comprehensively. Excellent cadres among the team members will be taught reconnaissance techniques, sentry duty, and communication methods to make the team members act alert and quickly.</p>

The "Panther" tank can be built in just eight days, and has a crew of six, including the driver and commander. Its turret is mounted on a movable platform, and when deployed, it maintains contact with the entire air force artillery unit, etc. with wireless electricity.</p>
<p>Military Facilities All Destroyed: German Army Withdraws from Cherbourg; Powerful Reinforcements Heard from Paris Approaching the Front Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to frontline news: The anti-Axis forces on the Cotentin Peninsula had completed the encirclement of Cherbourg by the 22nd, and the total counter-offensive against the fortress was approaching. The anti-Axis forces surrounded Cherbourg with a semi-circular encirclement of 10 to 15 kilometers. The U.S. commander in that area, Bradley, assigned the entire army, including artillery and tank units, to adopt a general offensive posture on the front line. Before launching a general attack on Cherbourg, the U.S. military actively conducted reconnaissance activities to discover the weak points of the German defense. The U.S. naval and air forces also cooperated with the ground forces in combat, and fiercely bombarded Cherbourg from the 21st to the 22nd. German coastal artillery also launched fierce attacks against it. In view of the fact that the Cotentin Peninsula was cut off, and the initial operational objectives of the fortress had been completed, the German army withdrew from the port after a final fierce resistance. The German army completely destroyed important military facilities and port equipment. The occupation of the port by the anti-Axis forces is of no value, and it will take a long time to rebuild the port.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to the Haitong News Agency: London news: After fierce bombardment, the U.S. military launched a full-scale attack on Cherbourg at 2:00 PM yesterday. The German army has retreated from the outer defense line to the inner defense line, which is about seven kilometers deep. The anti-Axis forces declared that they had occupied Saint-Pierre-Église, cutting off the connection between Cherbourg and the northeast end of the peninsula, while the anti-Axis forces were threatening Beaumont on the northwest end of the peninsula. The current general situation of the anti-Axis line of defense is from Saint-Pierre-Église via Martinvas, south of Cherbourg, to Montebourg.</p>
<p>Another dispatch stated that the anti-Axis headquarters announced on Thursday night that the Cherbourg encirclement was nearing completion. German reinforcements have moved west from Paris, and there is nothing to mention in other battle zones.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) Haitong News Agency: During the second phase of the anti-Axis forces' offensive in Europe, the attempt to seize suitable territory to launch a decisive offensive has not yet been realized, and it is difficult to predict how long this phase of the war will last. Even if the U.S. military can seize Cherbourg in the short term, it is still questionable whether the anti-Axis forces will be able to completely take control of the Cotentin Peninsula to deploy their forces and launch a large-scale offensive. The peninsula is only 65 to 70 kilometers long and 35 to 40 kilometers wide, surrounded by the sea on three sides and land on one side. The German side only needs to deploy heavy troops here and carry out collective bombing from the air, making it an excellent target. Moreover, deploying a corps of troops on the Cotentin Peninsula can only carry out positional attacks against the German defense line facing south. The German army will not easily allow the anti-Axis forces to succeed in this. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's occupation of the Cotentin Peninsula has not helped them launch a decisive offensive. The U.S. military has not yet been able to control the battle situation on the peninsula, and the Anglo-American forces have not been able to break through the German defense. The Anglo-American generals have deeply felt the difficulty of the offensive, and the rate of progress of the U.S. military has also slowed down. Their vanguard troops no longer dare to advance rashly towards the German positions, and seem to be gathering a large army before launching another offensive. The U.S. military in the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula is exerting stronger pressure on the area around Valognes, but the anti-Axis forces have made no progress. In the Sanglo area, there has been no change in the battle situation since the U.S. military failed to break into Villiers-Fossard. There were only small-scale battles between Trun and Aunay yesterday, and the British army's attempt to attack the highway from Camembert to Caen failed.</p>
<p>Soviet Army on the Eastern Front Launches Summer Offensive Fierce Fighting on the Orsha Highway Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to German news agencies, the long-awaited Soviet summer offensive began yesterday. The Soviet army, with strong rifle and tank units, launched a large-scale attack on the wide front from south of Mogilev to the Vitebsk area. The focus of the Soviet large-scale attack was on both sides of the highway from Smolensk to Orsha. The German army detected the concentration of strong Soviet artillery units there several days ago, but all Soviet heavy attacks were broken by the German army, and small-scale local incursions were immediately filled by German counter-attacks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) The German-Soviet war has reached its third anniversary. The German invasion of the Soviet Union was on June 22nd three years ago, and now it has entered its fourth year. In this fourth summer, the dynamics of the battle situation on the Eastern Front can be generally divided into two points: First, the Soviet Union may use two major fronts to launch a major offensive on the Eastern Front, while the offensive against Finland may only be a small-scale operation. Second, the calm Stalin may fuel the German-Finnish conflict, and wait for both countries to be exhausted before attempting to recover lost territory in the east. However, the German side believes that the former is more likely. German intelligence claims that the Soviet army has indeed been preparing for an offensive on the Eastern Front since the first ten days of May, and its offensive deployment is completely ready. However, it is still difficult to determine whether the Soviet army will be satisfied with simply recovering lost territory. The Soviet Union is quietly watching the landing operations in northern France and taking the initiative to advance, occupying the most advantageous position. However, its quiet observation also has a certain limit. If the German army completely drives back the Anglo-American forces, it will inevitably turn to the Soviet Union. Conversely, if the Anglo-American second front succeeds, then competition will inevitably arise between the Anglo-American and Soviet countries. Under any circumstances, the Soviet Union cannot adopt a quiet observation attitude. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Soviet Union will begin a major offensive at a certain time, and that time must be when the Anglo-American landing operation is gradually progressing and the German army is focusing all its efforts on Western Europe. There are also two theories about the Soviet offensive. One is that it will happen after Cherbourg falls, and the other is that it will happen when a decisive battle unfolds in the French central plains near Paris. The German army has prepared for this, so it can cope with the Soviet offensive at any time. Although it is difficult to predict where the Soviet offensive will be launched, the Soviet army has deployed a large offensive army on the entire line of 2,000 kilometers and is waiting for an opportunity in the following four locations, Northern battle money from Pskov and Otrov Local Strike Riga, Vitebsk and Gomel places, from Rovno and Tarnopol Local attack Roblin front, from Southern Iasi and Chisinau Local attack Romania. In short, the Soviet summer offensive can be launched anywhere. Among them, the German army is most concerned that Stalin may try to launch a central breakthrough operation, storming the Minsk and Roblin fronts and heading straight for the plains. The Soviet army has deployed more troops on this line than on any other line. The German air force's heavy bombing of Vitebsk, Gomel, and other places is probably also an attempt to hinder the Soviet offensive. The Eastern Front is the main battlefield of the German army, and this is probably well known by European countries.</p>
<p>Anti-Axis Forces in Italy Begin General Offensive German Right Wing Continues to Move North Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to German news agencies, the German military authorities said that after adjusting their forces, the enemy in Italy began a full-scale general offensive yesterday. The German army north of Grosseto retreated several kilometers to the north after fierce fighting. The enemy was defeated in the remaining Italian battle zones.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) Haitong News Agency: The German army on the Italian front used bad weather to hinder the advance of the anti-Axis forces. The German army used more artillery and mortars to resist the attack of the U.S. Fifth Army, and the British Eighth Army was also hindered by German minefields. After occupying Perugia, the British army split up and advanced. The troops advancing to the northeast have reached Nocera Umbra and Camerino. It is now believed that the German army is retreating to Ancona, an important port on the Adriatic Sea. The troops advancing to the northwest have advanced several miles towards Umbertide. The Magione town in the Lake Trasimeno area has been occupied, and it has crossed Lago by two miles. The German army is very active in the area around Chiusi.</p>
<p>Meteor Bombs Continuously Attack England Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) The German leader's headquarters announced on the 22nd that the German new weapon, unmanned aircraft, has been used continuously for more than 160 hours, with only a short interval in between. London is still under major attack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) The German military authorities met with reporters to describe the continuous bombardment of London by meteor bombs in recent days and have renamed it "simultaneous attack," which shows that the situation has become more intense. The changing of the firing method of meteor bombs can be said to have entered a new stage. A reporter from the German News Agency's air force reported on the power of meteor bombs, saying that one meteor bomb can match the power of a Flying Fortress fully loaded with bombs, but the manufacturing cost is very low, and it does not require a large number of air force personnel and air force support staff.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Aircraft Squadrons Attack Germany, Losing Over a Hundred Aircraft Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) The German military authorities announced that: On the night of the 21st, an English bomber squadron of about 150 aircraft attacked western Germany, and the German army shot down 62 of them. The high rate of damage was unprecedented. U.S. aircraft attacked Berlin on the morning of the 21st, suffering losses of up to 77 aircraft, including 16 that landed in Sweden.</p>
<p>Many Killed and Injured in Paris Air Raid Paris, 23rd (Central News Agency) Haitong News Agency: Anti-Axis aircraft raided the northern and western districts of Paris yesterday.

Bombs were also dropped in the 5th arrondissement of Paris. A nursing home in Saint-Denis was destroyed, and 11 bodies and 2</p>
<h3>Editorial: Cautious Use of County Magistrates</h3>
<p>Recently, the central authorities have gradually implemented reforms to local administration. Previously, there was the merging and adjustment of provincial administrative institutions, and recently, there has been the formulation of county administrative reform plans. While adjusting local administrative institutions and increasing the power and status of administrative officials are extremely important, the selection and assessment of administrative officials are even more crucial. If the selection of personnel is inappropriate, then the institutional adjustments will still be ineffective, and the authority will be... When assessing candidates for provincial chief executives, one must consider the interests of the people of the entire province. In addition to academic knowledge and experience, particular attention should be paid to integrity and honesty. Those who in the past only served their own selfish interests or the interests of their faction, disregarding the suffering of the people of the entire province, must not be easily appointed. As for county magistrates...</p>
<p>In the past, a certain province proposed three prerequisites for selecting county magistrates: "a writing brush, a mouth, and a pair of legs." A writing brush means being able to write thousands of words, communicating with the masses, and drafting plans in an orderly and stable manner. A mouth means being able to speak eloquently, persuading the masses, and debating in meetings with confidence. A pair of legs means being able to walk hundreds of miles, delving into the lives of the people, climbing mountains and wading through water, to attend to matters at hand. What are the needs of the people? What can the people not accept? What can the people accept? All of these should be known like the back of one's hand, with a clear plan in mind. Therefore, if one believes that the policies and orders of the higher-level government are obstructed during implementation, one can suggest revisions; if one believes that the implementation is unimpeded, one can achieve smooth results. On the one hand, if the county magistrate can deeply understand the hardships of the people and plan for the benefit of the people in all measures, then the people will naturally develop trust and love for this county magistrate. In the event that the central government needs to increase the burden on the people to implement a certain policy, it will not be difficult for the people to accept it willingly after the county magistrate explains and informs them.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether the selection of county magistrates is appropriate is of great importance to the quality of local politics. Currently, within the peaceful areas, it is rare to see the appointment of county magistrates in various counties based on meritocracy. Mostly, those with potential influence in the local area are appointed as county magistrates, or ignorant and incompetent individuals are appointed to seek official salaries. This leads to local politics not being on the right track, and the people's hardships are increasingly deepened. This is an issue that should be paid attention to when reforming county administration.</p>
<p>Secondly, some translators who have a rudimentary understanding of Japanese, taking advantage of their access to the local authorities of allied nations, are recommended by the allied authorities to serve as county magistrates. If they lack political knowledge or administrative experience, and their goals are not proper, once they take office, they become even more arrogant and overbearing, and the depth of the people's suffering can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>Now that the government authorities have decided to reform the entire administrative plan and will strengthen and unify county administration, concentrating power in the county magistrate and raising the status of the county magistrate, the responsibility of the county magistrate will be even greater in the future. Therefore, the assessment of county magistrate candidates should be more cautious. Regardless of any recommendations or guarantees, the central government should conduct strict screening, and all assisting personnel at all levels of the provincial and county governments should also undergo strict screening to meet the purpose of employing people based on talent. Those who do not meet the standards should never be forced to be appointed, so that local politics can achieve the practical effects of reform due to the appropriate selection of officials at all levels.</p>
