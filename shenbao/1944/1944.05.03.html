<p>社評</p>
<h3>增强科學教育</h3>
<p>東京電訊，日本文部省當局根據前決定之學校整頓要綱，會將官立學校整頓竣事，茲復準備全國之私立大學高專學校，以確立決戰體制實施整理，縮減文科系學校學生入學定額，順應科學戰之需要，增强理科系學校。又日本天長節天皇頒賜大學敎授六人文化勦章，其中研習自然科學，有特殊成績者計佔共四。日本政府當局對於科學的注意，一面訓練後進，一面獎勵先進，造成全國重視科學人才，信仰科學學術的風氣，誠是値得欽佩。日本提倡近代科學的時問，並不比中國爲早，可是因爲朝野一致的注意，敎育的普及，從明治維新（一八六八年）到現在，不過七十餘年，科學的成效大見，國家也因此就走上現代化的途徑。道些都是給我們一般講「迎頭趕上去」的人們，一個最切實最明顯的教訓。</p>
<p>科學人才要培養，要保護。培植和保護科學人才的地方就是科學教育機關。怎樣增進科學教靑機關，所以是目前最要的課題。我們的唯一主張是很簡單的，就是，多設獨立學院。我們不願意在現在戰時狀態之下，有許多「百科俱備」「組織龐大」的犬學，我們只希望有許多「組織簡單」的專科學院。我們更希望盟邦日本，在設備上，師資上予多我們以助力。</p>
<p>這個提議，一方面希望政府竭力利用已有的生產機關，或已接管的敵性生產機關設立學院。一方面希望工商企業冢，自動的請求大學敎授和學生們的合作，依照其本身事業性質，規定計劃，協助某一科某一部份的推進。譬如以紡織事業而論，財政部敵產委員會管理的敵性紗廠和中國人自辦的紗廠，雖然在目前原料動力等等困難之下，生產不易增進，但是這些至少是紡織業的基礎。這些基礎至少要負兩個責任，一是物質的生產，二是人才的培養。利用這個設備至少可以辦一個紡織學院，敎授們利用這個學院可以做上進的研究，可以訓練一般新人才。物質的困難是暫時的，國家的存在是永久的，戰時狀態一定要終止的，到了一切恢復正常的時候，國家耍復興，要建設，而找不到人才，那真是全國的慚愧。而且就在戰爭時期，因為有研究機關的設立，集中科學研究人才，更可以從事解決一切因戰事而感得困難的物質問題，盟邦日本和德國對於科學研究，均有驚人成績，沒有了汽油，就發明從煤裏面取油，缺少了淡氣原料，就發明從空氣裏取淡氣，一切的一切，只有從科學研究能够得到解決。全中國許許多多的工商企業，都可以合作起來，替未來中國造成這個百年樹人」之計。</p>
<p>科學人才的培植是目前中國最緊要的一件事。中國今後要成爲現代化國家，中國今後要想和先進國家並立，除了科學化以外，別無他路。要使中國科學化，就得先要人才，所以，今後中國立國之基，就在中國科學敎育的怎樣推進。</p>

<h3>渝疏散人口</h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電據渝電台廣播稱：渝市長賀國光特公布緊急布吿，嚴命普通市民，限由五月一日起至十日止，向各地疏散。</p>
<h3>重慶立憲問題的透視</h3>
<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>重慶允許中國民衆在戰爭結束後一年內成立立憲政府，四月二十九日的重慶贗播，大事宣傳全國對此的反響。這次廣播詞中，先述及中央社所報道的消息，繼線合各方面對憲法草案的反響。大意謂：「從本年起至今日止，這幾個月來，我們已經搜集了全國各方面對憲法草案的反響，從各地來的答覆，不下二百餘通」。</p>
<p>這廣播詞中，說這些答覆表示民衆在戰時極關心國家復興，因而頗致讚美。最後，他歸結人民的態度如下之三點：　三民主義響為憲法的基礎。　憲法的基本理念，　爲人民及國家的福利着想。　對於憲法的尊敬，應深入民問成為一種習慣。</p>
<p>現在我們不想指摘重慶贗播中分析時事的笑談，但有幾點很足引起關心這問題的人們之注意。</p>
<p>徵求民意結果</p>
<p>重慶廣播中說向全國徽求意見；又說，他們的答覆，表示人民對此極爲熱心，並充分認識他們的眞意。但事實上，從四萬萬以上的人口中，僅得到二百通答覆，似乎不能說是十分滿意罷！</p>
<p>關於這報告中另一件頗為希奇的事，即答覆的截止期爲五月二日。可是，重慶贗播不等到截止期，在三天前就條分樓析的報吿道些答覆信伴的內容了。</p>
<p>假使重慶廣播眞能如他們所說，從全國各方面搜集意見，那自然很好。可是，老實說，我們的印象適得其反，——那反響並不是從全國而來的，而重慶的官員們在那裏弄鬼</p>
<p>制憲問題</p>
<p>再循理研究下去，我們又想到另一事實：中國制憲問題雖然已經討諭好幾年了，雖然一次又一次的答應有一個立憲政府，但那仍舊是一紙空頭支票</p>
<p>一九三一年，中國進入了訓政時期，她開始預備按照國家憲法成立政府。迨至次年，（一九三二年），國民政府允許三年後（一九三五年）組織一國民會議，並成立一立憲政府。這在事實上是很奇笑的舉動，因爲像中國的這種國情，究有多少人受過立憲政治的初期訓練呢？然而人民却深信這諾言了。接着，一九三九年又發生類似的事情，第六屆國民參政會舉行第五次全體會議，又提起這問題，經決定「民國二十九年（一九四〇年）十一月十二日將組織一人民議會，頒布憲法，並决定正式成立立憲政府。</p>
<p>那時候關於這問題，——中國政治的中心問題！又引起一次更大的討論，爭　最烈的是國民黨與共產黨之間．可是討論儘管討論。到一九四〇年，却宣布無限期展延了。</p>
<p>到去年的第十一屆人民參政會，又提起這問題，並決定「戰爭結東後一年內成立立憲政府」。並且從本年起，重慶動員在其指揮下的每個宣傳機關——報紙·雜誌·無綫電——大事宣傳，讓人民知道，當立憲政府終於成立的時候，他們將獲得怎樣的待遇。</p>
<p>立憲的背景</p>
<p>我們在這裏要研究的，乃是重慶允許在中國正式成立一立憲政府的政治背景在那裏？因爲事實上中國的國內情形，和人民的政治訓練，都還不曾進步到足以實行這一步的程度。</p>
<p>讓我們略爲回顧一下最近中國的歷史以資說明。從一九三二年到一九三五年，國民黨在和共產黨的門爭中，遇到了幾次險境。一九三四年二月，蔣總司令到南昌指揮國民黨七分政治」的標語。</p>
<p>大約在那時候，立憲政府的問題又復活了。在某種意義上，那是一種轉變失敗命運的計謀。同時句話說，國民黨領袖承認共產黨用公開政治的政策擴充其勢力。</p>
<p>一九三九年，重慶政權覺得又須作同樣諾言了。他們覺得必須增強其經濟管理，集中其政治權力，以增加其削弱中的抵抗力，要有效地這樣做，必須動員全國民眾。但大業都已經疲倦了，並且表示倔強的態度，所以重慶領袖揭起了民主政府的旗號，計劃動員人民從事長期戰爭。</p>
<p>今天，我們又看見過去歷史的重演。重慶又允諾立憲政府——這次是戰爭結束一年後，——但這次戰爭的結束尙遙遙無期——那不靑說人民的精神已背離重慶了。</p>
<p>重慶在憲法問題上所費的時間與空間　多，那就是表示重慶的國內紛爭愈深。知通這情形之後，對於重慶廣播的一再分析憲法問題，就更覺得有興趣了。</p>

<h3>一區經濟處改採　綜合配給制度　市糧食局亦將逐步推行</h3>
<p>本市第一區公署經濟處，為適合戰時體制，　節人力物力起見，特將原有之物資配給辦法予以調整，改採綜合配給制度，自本月份起，予以實施，以期配給物資之圓滑，機構之週密，同時，市糧食局方面亦將逐步推行是項綜合配給制。茲將各情分誌於後：查第一區公署經濟處所辦理之物資配給，迄今共計七項：　食米，　麵粉，　食糖，　食油，　肥皂，　火柴，　煤球，均為市民日常之主要必需物品。過去配給物蹬均經分類規定，</p>
<p>樽節物力改採新制</p>
<p>憑房捐票及戶籍設向指定之發證處計口具領，但種類旣多，蹬紙不一，不獨發證每感繁瑣，而市民保管亦感易於散失，殊有另行調整之必要，是以該處為撙節人力物力以及時間起見，迭經硏討，決自本月份起實施綜合配給制度。</p>
<p>新證使用極為簡便</p>
<p>按綜合配給制，係將經濟處所實施配給之七項主要物資配給證，予以綜合發給，改成一種配給證，每一全張自一號至卅號，共分卅紙，並不印明配給物品項目，市民領得是項配給誼後，只須根據該區署佈告所指示之某號得購取某種教品，即可持取該某號證紙至指定之零賣處憑證購取配給物品，例如一號購米，一一號勝油，三號購糖，四號購肥皂，五號購麵粉，六號購火柴，七號購煤球，依次類推，並不先事規定，市民使用固極簡便而又易於保管，且免時時領發之繁瑣，蓋一全張之配給證。足可使用卅次，使人力物力時間均極撙節。</p>
<p>重行條中國年零賣商號</p>
<p>該經濟處為推行是項綜合配給制度起見，特將所有指定之零賣處登記號碼重行調整，包括米店烟紙店南貨店煤球店在內，在同一地區各該店之零賣處號　完全相同，是以綜合配給證听標明之零賣處碼，亦悉數先行指定，市民憑證購買配給物品，例如一號證購米，而證上零賣處號碼為一百號，則可向第一百號之米店購米，二號證購油則向策一百號之油店購油，其他煤球肥皂火柴等等均依次方式購取，蓋各該零賣處商店，均調整在鄰近地區，市民不致有往返跋涉之虞。</p>
<p>本月份起實施新制</p>
<p>此種健全之　口配給綜合制度，第一區公署經濟處本月份起予以實施，分別發給市民領用，但過去各項物資配給證，在未完全使用完罄前，各該證等仍屬有效，蓋綜合配給證上並未刋明物資項目，所有米粉油糖煤球火柴肥皂等原有配給證。在完全使用告罄後，關以新證使用，市民切勿悮解，致遭意外損失。市糧食局方面對於所配給之米粉油糖四項，亦將採取逐步推行是項綜合配給制度，惟過去該局對於油糖米粉等證，早已大批印就，如邃行新制，則各該證等勢必廢粱，物質上之耗損至鉅，殊失增節物力之旨，是以決採逐步推行制度。</p>
<h3>盟邦治外法權　決定本年撤銷　張司法部長發表談話</h3>
<p>司法行政部長張一鵬氏，於昨（二）日上午十時半，在該部駐滬辦事處接見本市各報社記者，發表就任以來之自信及感想如次：略謂余就任已歷三個半月，今日發表就任之自信及感想，歡迎諸位批評及糾正。本人就任時曾聲明以六個月為期，現巳及半數，近因辦事頗不順手，晚間不能入睡，致右腦質痛及有頰面部發腫，故為健康計，或未届六月，即行告退，惟現尙未能決定。在未離任前，對本年職務決不稍懈，所以三個半月來所為各事，自信足以告人者有下列數點：</p>
<p>因糧配給</p>
<p>囚糧問題，曾數度向米糧統制愈接洽，結果已領得一月份至四月份之四個月配給米糧，因去年十一月份，十二月份及本年一二月份之囚糧，均未獲得配給，而購之於黑市，以維囚糧，故領得之四個月配給米糧，可移下兩月，因此余在任時囚糧已無問題。　關於法院及檢察署之人事問題，在上海·首都·江蘇三省一市之人事調整計劃，幾已完成，此後對三省市各地推事檢察官之辦案問題，甚予注意，隨時吊閱案卷，親自審查辦案，有無錯誤。</p>
<p>整理鑒於</p>
<p>監獄，看守所之整理問題，監獄及看守所可分新舊兩種，新者已進行整理，舊者在各縣實無法整理。上海監獄之設備尙稱完善，如監獄戒護科長之撤銷，看守所弊畫較監獄為大，尤其是病犯每易死亡，如二月份死亡四五十人，三月份死亡三十剩人，一方面由社會人士捐助醫藥費及設法增加醫生，死亡已減去不少，病犯因營養不足，且缺乏運動，故病後每易死亡，現巳與廣慈醫院接洽就緒，由該院供給百剩病床給病犯醫治，如此當可為病犯造福。　法院所辦各案，有否不妥之善，本人曾吊閱較重火之案件，親自詳細審查。　前任羅部長曾應盟邦之請，成立法規編　委員會，另設顧問所，聘請盟邦人士為顧問，由日大使館推薦久禮田益喜為顧問，現已將「戰時租賃特別法」戰時民事刑事特別法」請其修改。</p>
<p>視察華北</p>
<p>最近本人將乘機至華北視察當地司法行政，以作統一華北司法之準備，蓋前與華北曾訂立司法協定，定于今年十月正式實行司法統一。　盟邦政府及大使表示，決定于今年下半年實行撤消治外法權，日僑之民事刑事，將均歸我國法院辦即，惟按照國際私法，如繼承法及家族法仍應用本國法，故派法官專門硏究，俾設專門推事，辦理日僑之民事刑事案件，現正積極籌備中。繼由各報記者提出各項問題，均由張部長圓滿答覆，直至十一時半始興辭而退。</p>
<h3>本報科學獎金　各界概助同業新聞報獨捐欵</h3>
<p>本報為獎勵華民國國民對於自然科學之硏究及發明，設置「申報科學獎金」，獎金部分，除由本報捐助十萬元，略示提倡外，為斯共策進行，增强效能，更歡迎各界人士自由捐助。昨承同業新聞報首先響應，捐助鉅款，並承社會人士紛紛捐助，均是感佩。仍盼各界踴躍推動，共策進行。茲將昨日捐助者合銜列后：</p>

<h3>戶口米供給　方法應改善　記者例會問題解答</h3>
<p>市宣傳處昨在市府召開第十三次記者例會，茲將各報社記者提出問題解答，分誌如下：</p>
<p>戶口米脫期</p>
<p>中華日報社問：一區六十七期口米，於四月廿一日開始發售，然當局布告含混，規定購領自米或糙米或糯米，一般市民無法得悉，米店領得之口米究為白米抑糙米，結果米店均以糙米配給市民，如商量改領白米，須按七折換取，其問非法利潤實可觀，此舉無異當局授米商舞弊之機會。猶憶月前商統會曾有建議主張戶口米配給白米，即或採購之米糧中確有　米在內，某勢又不能不充配給之用者，可凑滿一期後，同時一律配給，並於公告聲明，以杜流弊，米統會主委袁履登氏亦表贊同，函　主管機關督促，經正改善，言猶在耳，而現復如此規定，實屬令人費解，請關係當局有以答復之，同時該期口米據布告稱於廿一日發售，然至今各米店均稱尙未領到，其中是否有無其他情事，亦請明白答復，以重功令，而安民食。</p>
<p>第一區公署經濟處答：奔出所配戶口米，係向華中米　配給組合購進總　單，然後簽發分棧單給各食米零賣處，換言之本處所經手者，祇有棧單，貨物並不經手，故米質為白米抑糙米，事先本處無從知曉，蓋總棧單上並無詳細註釋也，須俟各零賣處將米領到後，方能肯定為白米抑糙米，若米統會今後對於供給華總米　配給組合之民食米，能詳細注明為白米或糙米，則本處得由依據報告民衆，否則奔出實無法更改也。至於各米店食圖非法利潤，有以糙米按照七折換取白米之舉，實堪痛恨，希望各界協力艱巨報告本處，自當依法究辦而社流弊。同時本處亦當通令各米店，將其所領到之米，在店門之前張貼通告，書明米質以免含混取巧。此次六十七期食米配給廷期，原因實係華中米榖配給組合出貨延緩之故，且其棧單又分數批繳來本處，則太處所簽發之分棧單，亦不得不隨之延期。自後米統會對於供給方法能注意改良，尤其對於配給數量，倘能如期充分供給，則此種現象當可避免。</p>
<p>夜總會逾時營業</p>
<p>中央社上海分社問：滬西各夜總會，營業仍屢超過當局規定時間，雖迭經處罰金，而冥頑如政，未悉當局將如何加以取締，以維法令威信</p>
<p>第一警察局答：警局對於各夜總會超過規定時間營業，定有四項處置辦法：　初犯者以書面警吿，　再犯者處以五千元以下罰金，　第三次犯者予以十天以下停止營業處分。　第四次犯者吊銷營業執照，勒令歇業。滬西各夜總會如法倫斯伊文泰等均一犯再犯，故最近曾以停業十天處分，尙有其他二家巳第四次超過規定時間營業，已準備按章予以歇業處分。</p>
<p>配給物亦漲價</p>
<p>平報社問：物價狂漲，漫無止境，當局正圖抑平，以蘇民困，何以近來配給物品之價格反形提高，如油價由二十剩元漲至五十剩元，火柴由一元漲至三元，限價香烟亦漲三倍，此項配給物品之漲價理由安在？</p>
<p>經濟局答：此次火柴配給，每小盒由一元漲至三元，完全因成本關係，經有關當局商定者，至油及香烟兩項之配給，則並非由本局辦理。</p>
<h3>法規編修會顧問　久禮田抵滬</h3>
<p>司法行政部法規編修委員會顧問久禮田益喜博士，上月下旬由日抵京就任。茲為料理公務，於昨日下午二時半自京乘事到滬。日大使館方面後藤，日總領事館中島領事等，暨司法行政張部長代表均往車站歡迎。久禮田氏係盟邦日本司法界耆宿，歷任日本大審院判事等要職，法學淵博，頗著聲譽。聞在滬勾留數日後，將返日一行。</p>
<h3>經濟處重申前令　商品須標價</h3>
<p>本市關係當局為穩定物價起見，曾規定各零售商店門市陳列貨品，皆須逐件標明價格，是項標籤並須置於顯者地位，且不得在　上加記暗號，唯邇來日久玩生，第一區公署經濟處，為持久穩定百物售價起見，爰特重申前令，各商號發售無論何種商品，均須標明每件每打或每一單位之價格，是項標藏須用中文，或阿拉伯字母　寫，頃經濟處巳訓令各業同業公會，令飭所屬會員一體知照。</p>

<h3>Enhancing Scientific Education</h3>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: Based on previous decisions regarding school reorganization guidelines, the Japanese Ministry of Education will complete the reorganization of government-run schools. Furthermore, it is preparing to reorganize private universities and higher vocational schools nationwide to establish a wartime structure. This includes reducing enrollment quotas in liberal arts programs and strengthening science and engineering programs to meet the needs of scientific warfare. Additionally, on the Emperor's Birthday, the Japanese Emperor awarded cultural medals to six university professors, four of whom had achieved exceptional results in natural science research. The Japanese government's attention to science, simultaneously training future talent and rewarding pioneers, is creating a national atmosphere that values scientific talent and believes in scientific knowledge, which is truly admirable. Japan's promotion of modern science did not begin earlier than China's, but due to the unified attention from both the government and the public and the widespread promotion of education, in just over seventy years from the Meiji Restoration (1868) to the present, significant scientific achievements have been made, and the nation has embarked on the path of modernization as a result. These are all practical and clear lessons for those of us who talk about "catching up."</p>
<p>Scientific talents need to be cultivated and protected. The place where scientific talents are cultivated and protected is scientific education institutions. How to enhance scientific education institutions is therefore the most important issue at present. Our only suggestion is very simple: establish more independent colleges. We do not want to see many "all-encompassing" and "hugely organized" universities during this wartime state. We only hope to have many specialized colleges with "simple organizations." We also hope that our ally, Japan, will provide us with more assistance in terms of equipment and faculty.</p>
<p>This proposal hopes that the government will make every effort to utilize existing production facilities or enemy-owned production facilities that have been taken over to establish colleges. On the other hand, we hope that industrialists and entrepreneurs will voluntarily request the cooperation of university professors and students, formulate plans according to the nature of their own businesses, and assist in the advancement of a certain subject or a certain part of it. For example, in the case of the textile industry, although production is not easy to increase under the current difficulties of raw materials and power, the enemy-owned yarn factories managed by the Enemy Property Committee of the Ministry of Finance and the yarn factories run by the Chinese themselves are at least the foundation of the textile industry. These foundations must bear at least two responsibilities: one is the production of materials, and the other is the cultivation of talent. Utilizing this equipment can at least set up a textile college. Professors can use this college to do advanced research and train new talents. Material difficulties are temporary; the existence of the nation is permanent. The wartime state will surely end. When everything returns to normal, if the country wants to revive and rebuild but cannot find talent, that would truly be a national disgrace. Moreover, even during the war, the establishment of research institutions can concentrate scientific research talents and engage in solving all the material problems caused by the war. Allied nations like Japan and Germany have made astonishing achievements in scientific research. When there is no gasoline, they invent oil extraction from coal; when there is a shortage of nitrogen raw materials, they invent nitrogen extraction from the air. Everything, everything, can only be solved through scientific research. Countless industrial and commercial enterprises in China can cooperate to create this long-term plan for cultivating talents.</p>
<p>The cultivation of scientific talent is the most urgent matter for China at present. If China wants to become a modern country in the future, if China wants to stand alongside advanced countries in the future, there is no other way but to embrace science. To make China scientific, we must first have talent. Therefore, the foundation of China's nation-building in the future lies in how to advance China's scientific education.</p>
<h3>Great War Results Obtained by Japanese Forces in Southern Sea Area of Caroline Islands; Three Enemy Ships Sunk and Twenty-Three Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 2nd: On the night of April 27th, Japanese air units launched an offensive against an enemy task force off the western coast of Hollandia, sinking one enemy cruiser and destroying one large warship (believed to be an aircraft carrier). On April 30th, an enemy task force appeared in the southern sea area of the Caroline Islands and attacked Truk Island on the 30th and May 1st, shelling Torok Island on May 1st. As a result of the counterattack by the local Japanese air units and ground defense forces, one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed and 23 enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy US forces are aggressively attempting to attack the Japanese strategic location in the central Pacific, the Caroline Islands, repeatedly bombing Truk and other islands almost daily. On the one hand, they are assembling a task force in the Marshall Islands area, waiting for an opportunity to invade. Until the 21st of last month, they once again dispatched more than ten aircraft carriers and battleships, attempting a risky attack on the Caroline Islands. On the 30th of last month and the 1st of this month, they used naval aircraft to bomb Truk Island, and on the 1st, they also shelled Torok Island with naval guns. The Japanese army, navy, and air force units in that area have established a strong defensive posture to prepare for an enemy attack. At this time, they received information that an enemy task force had appeared and immediately launched an attack, immediately destroying one enemy aircraft carrier and shooting down more than thirty enemy aircraft. After the Japanese forces' courageous and fierce attack, the enemy task force eventually collapsed and retreated.</p>
<h3>Landing Enemy Troops Suffer Blows</h3>
<p>Furthermore, on the morning of the 22nd of last month, an enemy force of approximately one division landed near Hollandia and Aitape in New Guinea. Later, they gradually increased their forces, a message that has already been released by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. In order to coordinate operations, the enemy task force has been attempting to invade the New Guinea area since the 22nd of last month. On the night of the 27th, Japanese air units ambushed the enemy forces, sinking one enemy cruiser and sinking one large aircraft carrier with a torpedo. Since the enemy troops began landing on the 22nd, the Japanese forces in that area have been receiving information about the enemy's presence, but because of the bad weather, the attacks have been difficult, so they have been waiting for an opportunity. On the 27th, the weather cleared, and as the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced, the Japanese air units bravely took off, achieving great war results on the western coast of Hollandia that night.</p>
<h3>Retreating Enemy Forces at Palel Attacked by Japanese and Indian Forces; Imphal Overwhelmed with Casualties</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The main force of the enemy 20th Division and a portion of the 23rd Division are attempting to break through the Palel Pass and are still resisting within the crisscrossing defensive positions. Elite Japanese units are currently launching a courageous attack against them, and the enemy forces at the Sebaum and Senaam 4562 high ground have been completely isolated. In addition, Japanese heavy artillery and infantry units cooperated to launch a fierce artillery attack on the enemy's Palel barracks and airfield northwest of Palel. As a result, the barracks and airfield caught fire on the 29th. At the same time, another unit emerged on the eastern side of the road from Palel to Imphal, seven kilometers northeast of Palel, and launched a fierce artillery attack on the enemy forces retreating north, causing confusion. The enemy forces in Imphal have been cut off from external support since March 28th, when the Japanese forces cut off the Kohima-Imphal highway near Mithub, relying solely on air supply to prolong their survival. They are currently anxiously struggling under the north-south pincer attack of Japanese and Indian forces. Since the attack began on March 8th, the enemy's Fourth Corps has suffered more than 30,000 casualties, and the streets of Imphal are now filled with casualties.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Bombs Tingshai Airfield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the night of the 1st, Japanese aircraft attacked the enemy airfield in Hengyang, which the enemy air force is actively building, destroying a portion of its runway, setting fire to one enemy aircraft parked on the field, and widely dropping large bombs on nearby military facilities, causing them to burn. At that time, the enemy attempted to intercept with fighter aircraft and responded with intense anti-aircraft fire, but the Japanese aircraft suffered no damage and safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Hankou, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the afternoon of April 30th, Japanese air units, with a combined formation of fighter-bombers, bombed the Yu airfield (200 kilometers south of Xi'an) in Shaanxi Province. The Japanese fighter squadron first engaged seven Yu aircraft that were attempting to intercept them in a fierce aerial battle, shooting down one of them. The Japanese bomber squadron aimed at the airfield runway and dropped bombs, all of which hit the target. In addition, they destroyed one transport plane that was attempting to flee the airfield. The Yu anti-aircraft fire was very weak, so the Japanese aircraft all returned safely to base.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a broadcast from Chongqing Radio, Chongqing Mayor He Guoguang specifically issued an emergency announcement, strictly ordering ordinary citizens to evacuate to various locations from May 1st to the 10th.</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Constitutional Issue in Chongqing</h3>
<p>— Jiangnan Hermit</p>
<p>Chongqing's allowance for the Chinese people to establish a constitutional government within one year after the end of the war, broadcast on April 29th, was heavily promoted throughout the country, along with reactions to it. The broadcast first mentioned the news reported by the Central News Agency, then summarized various responses to the draft constitution. The gist was: "From the beginning of this year to today, in these past few months, we have collected reactions from all over the country regarding the draft constitution. The replies received from various locations number no less than two hundred."</p>
<p>The broadcast stated that these replies indicated that the people were extremely concerned about national restoration during the war, and therefore elicited much praise. Finally, it summarized the people's attitude in the following three points: The Three Principles of the People should be the foundation of the constitution; the basic idea of the constitution should be for the welfare of the people and the nation; and respect for the constitution should deeply permeate the people and become a habit.</p>
<p>We do not want to criticize the jokes made in Chongqing's broadcast when analyzing current events, but there are several points that are worth noting by those concerned about this issue.</p>
<p>Results of Seeking Public Opinion</p>
<p>The Chongqing broadcast said that it sought opinions from all over the country; it also said that their replies showed that the people were extremely enthusiastic about this and fully understood their true intentions. But in fact, only two hundred replies were received from a population of over four hundred million, which does not seem to be very satisfactory!</p>
<p>Another peculiar thing about this report is that the deadline for replies was May 2nd. However, Chongqing's broadcast, without waiting for the deadline, analyzed and reported on the contents of these reply letters three days in advance.</p>
<p>It would naturally be very good if Chongqing's broadcast could, as they say, collect opinions from all over the country. But frankly speaking, our impression is quite the opposite - that the reaction did not come from the whole country, and that Chongqing officials were playing tricks there.</p>
<p>The Issue of Constitution-Making</p>
<p>Further logical research leads us to another fact: although the issue of constitution-making in China has been discussed for several years, and although a constitutional government has been promised time and time again, it is still just a blank check.</p>
<p>In 1931, China entered the period of political tutelage, and she began to prepare to establish a government in accordance with the national constitution. By the following year (1932), the National Government allowed the organization of a National Assembly three years later (1935) and the establishment of a constitutional government. This was in fact a ridiculous move, because given the national conditions of China, how many people had received early training in constitutional politics? However, the people deeply believed this promise. Then, in 1939, a similar thing happened again. The Sixth National Political Council held its Fifth Plenary Session, raising the issue again, and decided that "on November 12, 1940, a People's Assembly would be organized, the constitution would be promulgated, and a constitutional government would be officially established."</p>
<p>At that time, this issue - the central issue of Chinese politics! - sparked an even greater discussion, with the fiercest debate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. But despite all the discussion, in 1940, it was announced that it would be postponed indefinitely.</p>
<p>At last year's Eleventh People's Political Council, the issue was raised again, and it was decided that "a constitutional government would be established within one year after the end of the war." And from this year onwards, Chongqing mobilized every propaganda machine under its command - newspapers, magazines, radio - to heavily promote and let the people know what kind of treatment they would receive when the constitutional government was finally established.</p>
<p>The Background of Constitutionalism</p>
<p>What we want to study here is the political background of Chongqing's allowance for the formal establishment of a constitutional government in China. Because in fact, China's domestic situation and the political training of the people have not progressed to the point where they can implement this step.</p>
<p>Let us briefly review China's recent history to explain. From 1932 to 1935, the Kuomintang encountered several dangerous situations in its struggle with the Communist Party. In February 1934, Commander-in-Chief Chiang went to Nanchang to direct the Kuomintang's slogan of "70% Politics."</p>
<p>Around that time, the issue of a constitutional government was revived. In a sense, it was a strategy to reverse a failing fate. In other words, the Kuomintang leaders recognized that the Communist Party was expanding its influence by using a policy of open politics.</p>
<p>In 1939, the Chongqing regime felt that it had to make the same promise again. They felt that they had to strengthen their economic management, concentrate their political power, and increase their weakening resistance. To do this effectively, they had to mobilize the people of the whole country. But the masses were already tired and expressed an attitude of stubbornness, so the Chongqing leaders raised the banner of a democratic government, planning to mobilize the people to engage in a long-term war.</p>
<p>Today, we see the recurrence of past history. Chongqing is promising a constitutional government again - this time one year after the end of the war - but this time the end of the war is still far away - not to mention that the people's spirit has already turned away from Chongqing.</p>
<p>The more time and space Chongqing spends on the constitutional issue, the deeper Chongqing's domestic disputes are. Knowing this situation makes one even more interested in Chongqing's repeated analysis of the constitutional issue.</p>

<h3>First District Economic Office Adopts Comprehensive Rationing System; City Food Bureau to Gradually Implement as Well</h3>
<p>In order to suit the wartime system and conserve manpower and resources, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office of this city has adjusted its original material rationing methods and adopted a comprehensive rationing system, which will be implemented starting this month, in order to streamline the rationing of materials and ensure the thoroughness of the organization. At the same time, the City Food Bureau will also gradually implement this comprehensive rationing system. The details are as follows: The First District Public Office's Economic Office currently handles the rationing of seven items: rice, flour, sugar, cooking oil, soap, matches, and coal briquettes, all of which are essential daily necessities for citizens. In the past, the allocation of items was categorized,</p>
<p>Adopting a New System to Conserve Resources</p>
<p>and issued based on household tax tickets and household registration at designated issuance points. However, with so many categories and different forms, the issuance process became cumbersome, and citizens found it easy to lose the tickets. There was a need for a new adjustment. Therefore, the Economic Office, in order to conserve manpower, resources, and time, has repeatedly discussed and decided to implement a comprehensive rationing system starting this month.</p>
<p>New Permits are Extremely Convenient to Use</p>
<p>The comprehensive rationing system involves issuing a single consolidated permit for the seven major rationed items managed by the Economic Office, replacing the previous individual permits. Each full sheet contains 30 tickets, numbered from 1 to 30, without specifying the item to be rationed. After receiving this permit, citizens only need to refer to the district office's announcement to find out which numbered ticket can be used to purchase which item. They can then take the appropriate numbered ticket to the designated retail outlet to purchase the rationed item. For example, ticket number 1 is for rice, number 2 for cooking oil, number 3 for sugar, number 4 for soap, number 5 for flour, number 6 for matches, and number 7 for coal briquettes, and so on. This is done without prior specification, making it extremely convenient and easy for citizens to use and store. It also eliminates the cumbersome process of issuing permits frequently. A full sheet of permits can be used 30 times, saving manpower, resources, and time.</p>
<p>Re-Registering Retail Shops</p>
<p>In order to implement this comprehensive rationing system, the Economic Office has re-adjusted the registered numbers of all designated retail outlets, including rice shops, tobacco shops, dried goods stores, and coal briquette shops. The retail outlet numbers for each type of store are completely identical within the same district. Therefore, the retail outlet numbers marked on the comprehensive rationing permit are also pre-assigned. Citizens can purchase rationed items with their permits. For example, if ticket number 1 is for rice and the retail outlet number on the ticket is 100, then they can purchase rice from rice shop number 100. For ticket number 2 for cooking oil, they can purchase cooking oil from oil shop number 100, and so on for coal briquettes, soap, matches, etc. All of these retail stores have been adjusted to be in neighboring areas, so citizens do not have to worry about traveling long distances.</p>
<p>New System Implemented This Month</p>
<p>This sound, streamlined, and comprehensive rationing system will be implemented by the First District Public Office Economic Office starting this month and will be distributed to citizens for use. However, all previously issued item-specific rationing permits will remain valid until they are completely used up. The comprehensive rationing permits do not specify the item, so all original rationing permits for rice, flour, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, matches, and soap will be used up first before the new permits are used. Citizens must not misunderstand this, lest they suffer unexpected losses. The City Food Bureau will also adopt a gradual implementation of this comprehensive rationing system for the four items it rations: rice, flour, oil, and sugar. However, the bureau has already printed a large number of permits for oil, sugar, rice, and flour. If the new system is implemented immediately, these permits would inevitably be wasted, resulting in a significant waste of resources, which would defeat the purpose of conserving resources. Therefore, a gradual implementation system has been adopted.</p>
<h3>Allied Powers' Extraterritorial Rights to be Abolished This Year; Justice Minister Zhang Announces</h3>
<p>Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng met with reporters from various newspapers in the city at the ministry's Shanghai office at 10:30 AM yesterday (the 2nd) and expressed his confidence and thoughts since taking office, as follows: "I have been in office for three and a half months. Today, I am expressing my confidence and thoughts since taking office and welcome your criticism and corrections. When I took office, I stated that I would serve for six months. Half of that time has now passed. Recently, I have not been able to sleep well due to difficulties in my work, resulting in right-brain pain and swelling in my cheeks. For health reasons, I may retire before June, but I have not yet decided. Before leaving office, I will not slacken in my duties this year. Therefore, I am confident that I can report the following points regarding the work I have done in the past three and a half months:</p>
<p>Prisoner Food Rationing</p>
<p>Regarding the prisoner food rationing issue, I have contacted the Rice and Food Control authorities several times. As a result, I have received four months of rationed rice and food from January to April. The prisoner food rations for November and December of last year and January and February of this year were not received and had to be purchased on the black market to maintain prisoner food supplies. Therefore, the four months of rationed rice and food received can be carried over to the next two months. As a result, there are no issues with prisoner food supplies during my term. Regarding the personnel issues of the courts and prosecutor's offices, the personnel adjustment plans for the three provinces and one city of Shanghai, the capital, and Jiangsu are nearly complete. Hereafter, I will pay close attention to the handling of cases by judges and prosecutors in the three provinces and one city, reviewing case files at any time and personally examining whether there are any errors in the handling of cases.</p>
<p>Rectifying Prisons</p>
<p>Regarding the rectification of prisons and detention centers, prisons and detention centers can be divided into two types: new and old. The new ones have been undergoing rectification, while the old ones in various counties cannot be rectified. The facilities of the Shanghai Prison are fairly complete. For example, the position of head of the prison security section has been abolished. The abuses in detention centers are greater than in prisons, especially the high mortality rate among sick inmates. For example, 40 to 50 people died in February, and 30-odd people died in March. On the one hand, medical expenses are being subsidized by donations from the community, and efforts are being made to increase the number of doctors. The mortality rate has already been reduced significantly. Sick inmates suffer from malnutrition and lack of exercise, so they are prone to death after becoming ill. Arrangements have now been finalized with the Guangci Hospital to provide over a hundred beds for the treatment of sick inmates, which should benefit them. I have personally reviewed serious cases to see if there are any improprieties in the cases handled by the courts. Former Minister Luo responded to the request of the Allied Powers and established a laws and regulations revision committee and a consultancy, hiring Allied personnel as consultants. Mr. Kureta Masuki, recommended by the Japanese Embassy, ​​is a consultant, and I have asked him to revise the "Wartime Rent Special Law" and the "Wartime Civil and Criminal Special Laws."</p>
<p>Inspect North China</p>
<p>Recently, I will take a plane to inspect judicial administration in North China to prepare for the unification of judicial administration in North China. A judicial agreement was previously signed with North China, which is scheduled to be officially implemented in October this year. The Allied governments and embassies have stated that they have decided to abolish extraterritorial rights in the second half of this year. Civil and criminal cases involving Japanese residents will be handled by our courts. However, according to international private law, national law will still apply to inheritance law and family law. Therefore, judges have been assigned to specialize in the study of these laws to establish specialized judges to handle civil and criminal cases involving Japanese residents. Preparations are currently being made. Reporters from various newspapers then raised various questions, which Minister Zhang answered satisfactorily, and he left at 11:30 am.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper's Science Award; All Sectors Contribute; The News Daily Donates Exclusively</h3>
<p>In order to encourage the citizens of the Republic of China to study and invent in the natural sciences, this newspaper has established the "Shen Bao Science Award." In addition to the 100,000 yuan donated by this newspaper to show its initiative, we also welcome contributions from all sectors to enhance the effectiveness of this effort. Yesterday, The News Daily responded first by donating a large sum of money, and members of society have also contributed generously, all of which is appreciated. We still hope that all sectors will actively promote and jointly advance this effort. The names of those who donated yesterday are listed below:</p>

<h3>Methods for Supplying Household Rice Should be Improved; Answers to Questions at Reporters' Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>The City Propaganda Office held its 13th regular press conference at the City Hall yesterday. The answers to the questions raised by reporters from various newspapers are recorded below:</p>
<p>Household Rice Delivery Delay</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Daily asked: The 67th installment of household rice in the first district began to be sold on April 21st. However, the announcement from the authorities was ambiguous, stipulating that either white rice, brown rice, or glutinous rice could be purchased. The general public had no way of knowing what kind of rice the rice shops received. As a result, the rice shops distributed brown rice to the citizens. If they wanted to exchange it for white rice, they had to exchange it at a 70% discount. The illegal profit was considerable. This move was tantamount to the authorities giving rice merchants the opportunity to engage in corruption. I remember that the Business and Trade Association made a suggestion a month ago to distribute white rice for household rice. Even if there was brown rice among the purchased rice, if it had to be used for distribution, it could be distributed at the same time after a full installment, and the announcement should state this to prevent malfeasance. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Rice Control Association, also expressed his approval and sent a letter to the responsible authorities to urge them to improve the situation. The words are still ringing in my ears, but now the situation is the same again, which is really puzzling. Please have the relevant authorities respond to this. At the same time, the announcement said that the installment of household rice would be sold on the 21st, but so far, all the rice shops have said that they have not received it. Please also provide a clear answer as to whether there are any other circumstances in this matter, in order to emphasize official regulations and reassure the people.</p>
<p>The Economic Office of the First District Public Office answered: The household rice distributed by this office is purchased from the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination on a general voucher, and then a distribution voucher is issued to each rice retail outlet. In other words, this office only handles the vouchers, and the goods do not pass through it. Therefore, this office has no way of knowing in advance whether the rice is white rice or brown rice, as there is no detailed note on the general voucher. It will not be known whether it is white rice or brown rice until each retail outlet receives the rice. If the Rice Control Association can specify in detail whether the civilian rice supplied to the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination is white rice or brown rice, then this office can report to the public based on the information; otherwise, this office has no way to change it. It is regrettable that some rice shops are illegally profiting by exchanging brown rice for white rice at a 70% discount. We hope that all sectors will work together to report this to this office, and we will investigate and deal with it according to the law to eliminate malfeasance. At the same time, this office will also order all rice shops to post a notice in front of their stores stating the quality of the rice in order to avoid ambiguity and fraud. The reason for the delay in the distribution of the 67th installment of rice was due to the delayed delivery of goods by the Huazhong Rice Distribution Combination, and its vouchers were submitted to this office in batches, so the distribution vouchers issued by this office had to be delayed accordingly. In the future, if the Rice Control Association can pay attention to improving the supply methods, especially the quantity of rations, and can supply them fully as scheduled, then this phenomenon can be avoided.</p>
<p>Nightclubs Operating Past Hours</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency asked: Nightclubs in western Shanghai continue to operate beyond the time stipulated by the authorities, and although they have been repeatedly fined, they remain stubborn. I wonder how the authorities will crack down on them to maintain the authority of the law?</p>
<p>The First Police Bureau replied: The police bureau has four measures to deal with nightclubs that operate beyond the stipulated hours: 1. A written warning for first-time offenders; 2. A fine of up to 5,000 yuan for repeat offenders; 3. A suspension of business for up to ten days for third-time offenders; 4. Revocation of the business license and forced closure for fourth-time offenders. Nightclubs in western Shanghai, such as the Faluns, Ivantage, etc., have been repeat offenders, so they were recently suspended for ten days. There are also two other establishments that have exceeded the stipulated operating hours for the fourth time, and we are preparing to close them down according to the regulations.</p>
<p>Rationed Items Also Rising in Price</p>
<p>The Pingbao Daily asked: Prices are rising wildly and endlessly. The authorities are trying to suppress prices to alleviate the suffering of the people. Why have the prices of rationed items recently increased instead, such as the price of oil rising from 20-odd yuan to 50-odd yuan, the price of matches rising from 1 yuan to 3 yuan, and the price of price-controlled cigarettes tripling? What is the reason for the price increase of these rationed items?</p>
<p>The Economic Bureau replied: The price of matches this time has risen from 1 yuan to 3 yuan per small box entirely due to cost factors and was determined by the relevant authorities after consultation. The distribution of oil and cigarettes is not handled by this bureau.</p>
<h3>Kureta, Consultant to the Laws and Regulations Revision Committee, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Kureta Masuki, consultant to the Laws and Regulations Revision Committee of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, arrived in Beijing from Japan at the end of last month to take office. In order to handle official business, he took a plane from Beijing to Shanghai at 2:30 PM yesterday. Mr. Goto from the Japanese Embassy and Consul Nakajima from the Japanese Consulate, as well as representatives from Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang, all went to the station to welcome him. Mr. Kureta is a senior figure in the Japanese judicial world of the Allied Powers and has held important positions such as judge of the Japanese Supreme Court. He is a scholar of law and is well-known. It is reported that he will return to Japan after staying in Shanghai for several days.</p>
<h3>Economic Office Reaffirms Previous Order; Goods Must Be Priced</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize prices, the relevant authorities of this city have stipulated that all retail stores must mark the price of each item displayed in the store. These labels must be placed in a prominent location and must not be marked with hidden codes. However, as time has passed, some have become lax. In order to maintain the stability of the prices of all goods, the Economic Office of the First District Public Office has reaffirmed its previous order that all businesses must mark the price of each item, each dozen, or each unit for all goods sold.
