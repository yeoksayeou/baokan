<h3 id="c1">提倡搭吃雜糧 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近來米價黑市已入於靜止狀態，縱不再昇，而目前價格，對於一般市民，尤其薪水階級者，殊感難以應付的威脅。米價波動，已遂兩旬，在此期內，大多數富有家庭，或有積糧，尙未受到高價米的直接痛苦。但普通住戶，積糧不致有逾週之量，所以，今後的一日三餐，完全取之於目前的高價米了。薪水階級的收入，一般的說，不過三五千元，一月所入，僅能換取三五斗米，試問如何贍養一家生活？如何度過今後的歲月呢？</p>
<p>米價黑市之高，十之七的原因是人爲的。農民成本實際上不會超過海石三千元。最爲遺憾者，在五月二十四日政府公布京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要後，未會同時規定產地米的最高限價，遂予各當地不肖米商以投機暴利的機會，乘機抬價。在政府當局的原意，按照實際成本，附加合理利潤，完全顧到農民辛勞的利益。不意產米地區存米數量，實際在米商手中者多於農民所有，不肖米商遂伺隙得逞，所以，一且政府公布新辦法後，狂抬倍蓗，就本市而言，原與產地不肖米商聲氣相通，彼此呼應，竭盡投機暴利之能事，黑市狂跳遂至不可收拾。對於這輩只顧私利的投機暴利者，查明確據後，應卽處以戰時極刑，以爲後來者烱戒。</p>
<p>爲今之計，在積極方面，我們一再建言對策，疏運來源，以期穩定米價。在消極方面，必須提倡搭吃雜糧，以减少米之需要。雜糧在營養價値上言，比之白米爲佳。很多不產米區域，以雜糧爲日常食料者，人民一般體格反見强健。譬如苞米元麥均可磨粉煮飯。上海人稱苞米粉爲六谷粉，以爲牲畜所食。但江北專產苞米區域，自每年七月至翌年四月，人民均以之爲經常食糧，一年之中，三年賴以爲生。其製飯之法，以苞米磨粉，經二三次之研磨篩勻，粉極細膩，拌於沸水中，稍頃卽成熟飯，原極味香可口。如在白米飯中搭拌二五成，則更爲香適。如食同樣數量之苞米粉飯與白米飯比較，則苞米粉飯更爲耐飢。其次，如元麥亦爲雜糧中主要之一種，每年四月至七月，亦爲產地人民經常食糧，同樣可以磨粉煮飯。小麥磨成麵粉，僅可做爲麺食品，不能煮飯，南方人不慣每餐麵食者，元麥之應用實較小麥爲大。產米區域，原以米爲經常食糧，華中華南大多爲產米區域，遂不知苞米與元麥之價値，更以賤視眼光以爲牲畜所用。現在環境推移，白米取給困難。希望上海市民，注意雜糧同樣可貴，同時搭食。希望當局採辦苞米等雜糧，大規模應粉，代米配給。惟採辦時須注意乾潔，不被　雜攙水，不使發獎。磨粉時務求細膩，保持苞米粉足爲食糧的價値，引起市民搭食的興趣與習慣。如此，對於白米可以减少需要程度；對於民食，可以多關調節途徑。</p>
<p>最後，希望市政當局從速舉辦平　，與雜糧記給同時實施，俾於糧價得到切實的壓力，使之逐漸趨回。</p>
<h3 id="c2">國立各學校經費　將照新槪算發給　敎育部規定增收學費辦法 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京十九日中央社電教育部於十九日下午三時，接見中外記者，李部長派高等教育司司長朱鈺代見，並發表談話如左：　寬驚國立學校下學期經費。本部直屬地國立學校經常費，邇來物價高漲，與日並進，故此次編造下半年經常費概算，均酌量增加數額。自下學期起，各校經費可照核定新概算分別發給，俾資維持。　規定各級學校徵收學費辦法。本部規定自下年度起，爲提高教職員待遇計，除師範學校不予微收學費，另行籌劃補助外，其餘各級學校，均准徵收學費，以資挹注，至各校家境淸寒學生，以及教育文化界人員，或低級公務員之子弟，應酌設免費學額，以示體恤。</p>
<p>停辦國立浙江大學經過，及結束辦法。國立浙江大學自復校以來，校舍迄未收回，購置困難，設備簡陋，各院系敎授人才亦感缺乏，投考學生甚少。在現情勢下之該校　實無存在之必要。業經本部呈奉院令停辦。該校本學期考試及格各生，予以優先收容，俾資繼續肄業。其結束辦法，大略如下：（甲）該校現有之教職貝，由本部設法安置，或介紹至其他大學，擔任教職。（乙）該校本學期提前舉行學期考試，凡考試反格之學生，均由該校給予修業證書，俾能轉入其他大學。另由本部分令京。滬各國立大學，優先收容。（丙）該校所有全部校產，資由浙江省教育應接收保管，聽候處置。（丁）該校儘於本年六月十五日以前結束完竣，呈報備案，　調整留日學生事宜。最近友邦爲適應戰時環境起見，商得本部同意，規定本年度華中方面留學生，除大東亞省補助二十五名外，其餘公私費生名額，以五十人爲限，業經本部咨達各省市政府　飭敎育廳局遵辦，並已登報公吿，　籌編民國三十四年國民歷。民國三十四年國民歷，已於本年三月間開始籌編，業經編造預算呈奉行政院核准。</p>
<p>南京十九日中央社電　國府教育部茲與日政府折衝決定，本年度中國各地留日學生之數目，定華中爲七十五名，華北百五十名，華南三名，共二百八十八名。內由日大東亞省給費學生百五十名，中國公私費生一百八十三名。茲悉此等留日學生，定八月士旬於各省及各時別市政府實施學科試騐後，即於九月中旬赴日。</p>
<h3 id="c3">冒岳麓山重砲射擊　日軍包圍長沙市街 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>漢口十九日中央社電　總攻長沙之日軍部隊，冒岳麓山渝軍砲兵陣地之重砲射擊，向長沙猛撲，遂於十七日晨，越過粵漢綫，攻入長沙城南側，佔頒其一角。按自日軍實行第一次第二次長沙作戰以來，渝軍即在該地築有堅固之防禦陣地，使其成爲一大要塞，渝軍之抵抗，極其頑强。但日眾各部隊繼續猛攻，其艱苦實非言語可能形容，刻正在長沙市內，展開激烈之巷戰中。</p>
<p>（又電）進攻長沙之日軍部隊，於十八日上午八時，攻入長沙市街東南角之城壁，刻日軍已將市街八公里完全包圍，以致渝第四軍二師命遝已危如彙卵。又渝軍再自岳麓山及其東側之天馬山野山砲陳地，纔續作頑强掩護砲擊，然經日軍地上部隊及日機協力，已完全制壓長沙上空，對渝軍陣地以巨彈加以轟擊，刻長沙攻防戰，已達最高潮。</p>
<p>日軍某基地十九日中央社電　日華中軍先進部隊，現已達到渝第四軍根機地長沙城外。日軍於十四日夜，首將長沙對岸岳麓山方面馬警川之渝有力第一綫陣地佔領後，同時其他部隊，於十六日黎明，亦冒雨攻佔岳麓山南面之渝軍第一錢陣地。更於同日傍晚，復佔領長沙城外之警戒前行陣地。按現防衛長沙之渝第四軍，包括第九十六師等三師，及暫編第五十四師等四師，據天然形勢，構立重砲陣地及山砲陣地，以及號爲鐵壁之防衛要堤，企圖死守長沙。此渝第九戰區重要據點長沙，自前年一月長沙作戰以來，業已三年，今該地於第三次作戰之下，已陷於日軍之範圍，目下砲聲隆隆兩方正在激戰中。</p>
<p>對天馬山猛烈攻擊</p>
<p>湖南日軍前綫基地十九日中央社電　第九戰區最大據點長沙，現已完全陷於重圍中。渝第四軍雖欲突破日軍之包圍網，作必死之頑抗，但日軍冒岳麓山之前哨陣地天馬山渝軍機槍與山確射擊，勇猛前進中。天馬山位於長沙市街南端之對岸，爲一標高一六七公尺周圍二公里半之丘陵，形成岳麓山之外圍陳地。自長沙南方進攻，俯瞰日軍部隊，一望而見，爲敵極有利戰略之要點。天馬山之奪取，即可制長沙之死命，在日軍精銳空陸軍相呼下，向該山展開最後之猛攻。</p>
<p>勸告城內渝軍停戰</p>
<p>日軍某基地十七日中央社電　猛攻長沙之日軍，於開始攻擊渝第四軍以前，爲免使長沙市街遭受戰禍，保存各勝古跡，及免傷害無辜民衆起見，自十七日以來，以飛機散發傳單，勸城內渝軍停戰。按日軍前於河南作戰，不忍古都洛陽遭受戰禍，前曾忍受作戰上之不利，今對長沙又取此種正義之措置。</p>
<p>渝軍退路已被截斷</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電據天聯社重慶電，湖南戰錢戰况如次：日軍曾繞至長沙東方，寶行進攻，刻正攻淥口車站（粵漢綫及湘桂綫接繼點之要衝，距衡陽最近）。渝軍事委員會曾發表，刻正於淥口北方，繼續作戰中云云。長沙現雖仍在渝軍手中，然由該市之退路，殆被日軍遮斷，故守備該市之渝軍，己陷絕望。</p>
<p>日機猛炸渝軍基地</p>
<p>中國方面日軍基地十九日中央社電　日轟炸機隊爲澈底擊減在渝美空軍，乃於十七日下午一時五十分，分兩隊急襲江西省玉山飛機塲，及浙江麗水飛機塲，炸戰基滑定路，及附設軍事設施，使陷於一時不能使用狀態，日機均安返基址。</p>
<p>擊落擊毀美機多架</p>
<p>漢口十九日中央社電　日航空部隊新銳，爲擊減駐渝美空軍及掩護日軍進攻起見，連日大舉出動轟炸。十七日又空襲渝軍根據地長沙，於長沙上空，遭遇渝美戰鬥機加齊斯P40型及P51型機七架，即展開空戰，擊第P40型一架，重創一架。</p>
<p>安慶十九日中央社電　十八日下午十時，有敵機P38型P25型機組成之敵戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊中餘架，來襲安慶。但經日戰鬥機隊邀擊後，擊落基P8壞機五架（其中朱證實者一架），整毀其二架，是役日軍無損害。</p>
<h3 id="c4">南方各土侯　協力日軍　自動增加生產 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>峇厘把板十九日中央社電當日軍進駐南婆羅洲之塔拉坎與峇厘把板時，婆羅洲之第一土侯田加倫侯及其他各土侯，即迅速身臨峇厘把板，欣然表明原居民對日本誓盡忠誠之決心。蓋當荷蘭爲政時，由彼等手內剝奪一切之教育，更盡其無限度之壓榨，彼等唯有忍耐祈禱救濟之神到來。洽當此時，被等之前突有日軍降臨，一舉粉碎荷蘭勢力，故彼等莫不異常感奮，此後二年餘之軍政推展彼等之教育，爲期彼等衣食之自足，更不惜與以任何援助，日本決無如英美荷對其他民族之壓榨及種族之偏見，常以深厚之誠意。指導彼等向上發展，故田加倫侯及布倫剛侯等，今對日本溫存之指導倍極感激，乃協力日軍完遂大東亞戰爭。各土侯更爲開發戰力資源，增加生產，正當動與原居民同立陣頭，執誠工作中。</p>
<h3 id="c5">無情的判斷 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>英美近會盡情地攻擊重慶，他們非難重慶的不現代化，無權力，不傾向民主化，及缺乏內部的團結。在另一方面，華萊士身爲美國副總統的要職，而被派赴重慶。美國並已與重慶簽訂一新的信用協定，允增加租借法中的援助。英國自也不甘落後，譽重慶爲「四强之一」。她并且用更聰明的方式，不着多字的指出封建性重慶的許多過失的性質，正是使重慶成爲有力的因素。逍些都是英美對重慶所慣施的「威迫」與「利誘」的手段。</p>
<p>但本月份在莫斯科出版的蘇聯雜誌「戰爭與勞働階級」，考察並分析重慶的抗戰力筱，立刻非難謂：「重慶的精銳軍隊在河南戰役中，遭受最大的慘敗。重廢當局用中國經濟的落後，軍備的缺乏，與英美軍事援助的不充分等，作爲解釋此次慘散的理由。在抗戰區內，曾草擬了許多計劃，但沒有一個計劃是爲建設重慶的軍事與工業的基礎」。重慶國民黨近曾秘密舉行中央執行委員會第十二屆全體會議，通過復興方案，而由重慶常局披露，這批評即發表在該次會議之後。</p>
<p>該誌在另一節中又稱：「重慶官吏中失收主義的傾向頗爲濃厚。過去二年內有二十個司令官帶了他們的兵士參加和平陣營，觀此，則重慶軍隊在河南的敗北，是不足爲奇的，在重慶目前的情勢下，自有其原因在。」</p>
<p>河南戰役之後，湖南長沙附近又展開激戰，渝軍節節敗退。但正如該誌所指出：軍事的失欺，「在重慶的目前情勢下，自有其原因在」，所以那結果自在意料之中。</p>
<p>蘇聯雜誌的這種詳盡的分析，與英美的「威迫利誘」政策截然不同，他的觀測是實際主義的。英美對重慶的批評，是要驅使重慶爲了他的戰爭與政治的利益而抗戰到底。反之，蘇聯刊物的批評，純用第三者冷靜的態度，指出重慶的錯誤。我們不欲多所述及「戰爭與勞働階級」听作的分析，但我們想指出，當世界戰爭進展到決定階段，而由蘇聯的出版物說這積話，實是直刺重慶心臟的一下銳利的突刺。在重慶抗戰的初期，蘇聯曾稱頌重慶爲英雄，有時候甚至帶着傳奇色彩，我們請蘇聯再回想一次當時的情景。</p>
<p>「戰爭與勞動階級」創刊於去年六月，自那時候起，該誌上祗有二篇文章涉及重慶。第一篇是洛古夫寫的，他是一個銳整的新聞記者，曾爲塔斯通訊社的上海通訊員，該文發表於去年八月，討論重慶的抗戰力量。第二篇就是上文所說的那篇。這二篇文章並未意外地爲了失敗的戰鬥者而放鬆他們的拳頭，也並未表明莫斯科出亟物在重慶初期抗戰中所觀察到的傾向。其故究安在？</p>
<p>沿着這綫索。不難一步一步的解決日本與蘇聯在遠東的權利，及外蒙古與新疆省的邊境事件。在一篇評論日蘇簽訂漁業條約的論文中，該誌說：「我們必須注意，這條約的成立，顯然表示這二個國家願意遵守中立條約的精神，並平等解決兩國間各項主要問題。這言論是重慶的負資者應該注意的。從重慶所走的路推斷起來，渝政權對蘇聯是無意義的，莫斯科宣言中雖曾承認重慶爲四强之一，但克萊姆宮僅視重慶爲一地方政權罷了。</p>
<p>戰事的發展正以驚人的速度進行中。在這時候，一方有力而公正的鄰國，對曾被列爲四强之一的重慶，下這種無情的判斷，那是重慶的主戰份十所應該深思的。</p>

<p>仰光十九日中央社電恕江前綫渝軍，迄今已喪失將兵至大，犧牲武器甚大，其後又來進攻，然日軍之防禦堅如鐵辟，日軍之作戰尤稱巧妙，故渝軍之來襲惟有徒遭失敗，並無若何收獲。本月十日，渝軍企圖奪回龍陵一帶，乃以約二師之兵力來襲，日軍當即反擊，迫其向東方敗退。又日軍對來攻　頭街附近之渝兵數百，曾加以殲減，此役渝軍遺屍二百三十三具，日軍鹵獲迫擊砲，重機關砲，目動步槍及其他軍需無數。又十四日正午，日軍部隊與來襲江萱街之渝眾潰成激烈砲戰，渝之山砲，野砲等，全被擊毀，又收拾空輸物資之渝軍，亦遭痛擊，因而渝軍之企圖已化泡影。此時，密芝那方面之敵，爲奪面北緬陣地，亦呼應來襲，然日軍新銳亦陸續到達，至十二日判明之戰果，僅敵屍即　二千五百具。</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德國又一秘密武器，不久恐亦將出現。德權威方面謂德國流星炸彈不停轟炸倫敦及英南部之後，將再有另一種新武器出而協助之。此次侵歐敵軍百分之七十係屬美人而非英人，然此次德國新武器之轟炸倫敦，則正中英國之心臟，欲逃避亦已不可能矣。倫敦方面曾每日發表轟炸德國所投炸彈之噸數，據云在柏林一地投彈已逾五萬噸，德國今當加倍奉還矣。聞施放流星炸彈之人員，在每一炸彈之上均以粉　書有「為科隆復仇」「爲柏林報復」等字樣。</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據倫敦電：英政府對於德國以無人飛機作報復攻擊事，深感狼狽，並知素日之防空組織不能收效，決急速改革。十七日晚間發表謂，英南部高射砲隊爲截擊德國之無人飛機，應革新組織，在無人飛機到達人烟稠密地區之前，則應集中最大火力，儘力阻攔。聞該無人飛機，並無普通飛機墮伴。</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：無人飛機及流星炸彈，原係少數工人所製造，此輩工人曾與外界隔絕多月，以免洩漏秘密。此項新武器攻擊倫教及英南部，已奏膚功，現已大規模製造矣。</p>
<p>沮里希十九日中央社電德軍之無人飛機，己使英國國民陷於極度恐怖中。至其正體究係何物，德軍曾宣稱，為最大口徑之新式爆炸體。機瑞士報訪員報稱，此種火箭式飛機，有破壞原子之爆炸力，乃自遠距離以電波操縱之自動式爆炸彈，由高空投下，且於數百公里之後方向目的物射去。此種炸彈兩側有翼，外形酷似飛機。英國各報對於此物之正體，正作極種推測，據稱有兩種形狀，一為長約六碼乃至八碼，兩側有翼，一為較普通戰關機稍小與自由式飛機類似。其爆炸力雖尚不明，然因操縱方法之不同，即發生二可能性，一，即在後方自特殊飛嘰上由人手以無綫電操縱，二，則為自大西洋海岸基地以大炮射出，其塲所距海岸大約三十至四十公里。至於如何瑮縱，尚屬疑問，此種自動式飛機於此次戰爭中，究有何等影響，實屬一重要問題。然德國何以不早使用此種新穎兵器。或因技術困難，抑或鑒於繽曼第戰局重大，為發揮戰略效果而使用者，若果如此，德軍將必與其他兵器同時長久供用。德政府當局日昨發表聲明，請此種　兵器非為一次二次示威之用，今後決繼機應用於作戰方面，由此可知對於此種兵器之質與量，德軍當局極具相當自信。</p>

<p>侵歐軍抵坦汀西岸</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電海通社訊：反軸心軍在法國登陸之第十三日，得佔領若干地方，但仍未獲得進攻德軍防綫之適當根據地，因此，反軸心軍竭力爭取大海港，進取哈佛既未獲逞，唯有進攻瑟堡而已。其進取瑟堡之圖與切斷克坦汀半島，同時呼應發動，但取瑟堡需付重大代價。勃拉特萊將軍全力進行切斷半島計劃，週五日進抵維康特（Vicomte）後，次日即以全部美軍預備隊應戰，繼續西進，刻在劇戰中，德軍堅强抵抗，但以相對少數全部隊作戰。反軸心軍向卡倫坦至普斯之公路增加壓力，但進展甚微。美第一軍左翼，於前午在維爾與特羅姆間向桑洛進攻，德軍在城郊迎擊，美軍倉皇潰退。柯蒙之英軍第二軍右翼及奧納河以東之左翼均取守勢，在柯蒙以東之部隊已退至里夫萊（Livry）。英軍第二軍中路向蒂萊進攻，亦爲德軍所阻，蒂萊及克恩前綫，戰局無變化。</p>

<h3 id="c19">車上所見 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>乘上了松江二十點五十分開的列車。記者為了觀察米糧搬運的實際情形，佔領了車箱外面的升降口，張大了眼睛，深恐忽視了一個人，一袋米。已是夜色蒼茫的時候，站員手中的電筒光，在月合上忽明忽減。在兩節二等車的常中，一個新聞記者虎視眈眈地站着，為了覓取記事的材料。這時，他們，單幫客人，却迅速大膽地開始行動。從月台的反對方面，忙着裝上一袋一袋的米。剛看見有一個在車門邊接受米袋的男子，不料還有一個男人竟以那個男子的肩和頭當做踏脚，像猿猴一樣敏捷地爬上車頂，大約裝上了四袋米吧，電筒光突然一閃　「那樣混雜，擠不下人了，還要上去！」站員這樣說着走了開去。記者想打開門來看一看全部裝載的狀况，握住把手一拉，軋的一聲，門依舊未曾打開。開不開是有道理的。原來入口的階級上有一個小孩將身體掛在門紐上。此處是我的陣地，決不讓敵人窺覷。他是和米一同頑强地固守着。</p>
<p>忽然有一個三十四五歲的女人負了兩個米袋走到這裹來，將四斗米光景的袋塞入對面二等車中的坐席深處，自己則遁入了二等車。之後，車掌發見了，將它拖出來問道：「這是誰的？」誰都是「不曉得」。車掌發怒了，將那些米袋曳到車箱外面。車頂上的男子恰巧從上而垂下兩隻腳，悠悠然吸着香烟。「呃哼，眞太放浪啦，米數子！」車掌用小棒打了那兩隻腳一下。那個男十像上陸的蛙一般，忽的將足縮了上去，悄情地藏過了身體。一陣難以表現的悲喜之感兜上了記者的心頭。「今天的事情至此已做到九分九了，以後祗要在上海的收票處付三十元行李費就得了。哈哈，又可賺一筆錢啦！」他或許在安全地帶如此笑着想吧。</p>
<h3 id="c20">車中所聞 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>我一定要將米糧列車的實感忠實地報告讀者——</p>
<p>記者和一個女人展開了一問一答的舌戰。在車下閃閃飛出火花，轟轟響着輪聲。男的是記者，女的是米販；記者感到心庠庠地。</p>
<p>「你有了票子嗎？」記者用生硬的上海話問道。</p>
<p>「自然有的，先生。不過有雖有，此處是二等三等交界的地方，車掌也許會來嘩啦嘩啦的，眞担心事呢！」她說。</p>
<p>「一直跑到那裏？買了幾斗？」</p>
<p>「到楓涇哩，祇有三斗。一袋她自己坐着，另一袋她讓記者坐。從前水戶黃門因為坐在草包上被老嫗所打而喜，但在火車的升降口內，却沒有打記者的人。記者安心坐下，開她講種種事情。由於言語不能全懂，頗有入虎穴不得虎子之感。這的確遺憾之至，她的話大要如次：</p>
<p>「我是兩個月以前開始販米的。丈夫在事變後死在寗波，遺下兩個孩子，大的十二歲，小的八歲，都沒有進學堂。我們一共有五個夥伴。幹這行生意如果五六個人合夥做，比較有照顯些。一個月的收入雖說可有一萬元以上，但實際上是沒有如此多的，因為不是每天都跑的，而且米價雖漲，火車費和「開銷」也大起來了，所以收人多了以後，支出也大了。起初祗跑松江，現在是跑楓涇了，因為楓涇的米便宜一點。米是從楓涇的米行收來的。米行向種田人買，我們向米行買。米行門檻很精，祇想抬高米價。我們是要上海米價特別高，楓　米價特別低才可賺錢的，世土的人總是想自己獨賺的。最難的就是三等車少，不大容易趁得上，車票也不容易買到。而鐵路公司又規定無票乘車或三等票趁二等車要加十倍罰款，這眞為難呀！不過，有錢的話付了也就沒事啦。可是將米拿去抵充，那不長太無法無天了嗎？我們幹這項生意也長出於不得已，鐵路方面不嘩啦嘩啦豈不好嗎？這門生意最大的難關是上火車。如果容易上車，跑的人一定還要多。當然，明日也是要去的。」</p>
<p>她拿出香烟，向記者討一個火。她的香烟似乎是三炮合哩！紫當色臉孔的女人，吸着烟，談着米的事情。這個印象是太深刻了。</p>
<h3 id="c21">偷米賊 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>列車駛抵徐家派。米和人下軍的很多。到了西上海也是一樣。徐家滙·西上海，北站三個車站，合計總有五百名下去的人吧。車頂上的勇士到了車近西上海時，也從上面爬下來。帮他下來的夥伴接着一個一個　開了車頂。地除去搬下來的數袋米以外，還穿着「米的背心」。背上是米，胸前也是米，眞是一件米的防彈馬甲。這個大漢，我想，總帶了合計二石光景的米吧。</p>
<p>到了西上海站，忽然發生了一大事件。記者正和那個要到北站下車的女人談得起勁的時候，突然聽到女子的笑聲。向那邊一望，是一個年約十八九歲姿色尚佳的少女，衣著也漂亮，雖然哭得很悲切，却不失其美麗。車掌走出車箱外面，又跑進了別一節二等車。似乎有一個壞人偷了放着的四斗米，先一脚在徐家滙下了車。少女一面哭泣，一面數說鐵路職員的不法。兩個年輕的路警和一個彷彿是車掌助手的人，似乎因為妙齡女郎的嬌啼而晨出了男子氣概，三人一同去請日本車掌來。車掌是來了，可是失去的東西並未出來。少女滿面嬌嗔，攻擊車掌。車掌弄得沒有法子，祇好說了一聲「混賬」，採取三十六計走為上策的戰略，狼狽地避了開去。餘下的三個年輕人和美麗的少女再在那一帶仔細搜尋了一回兒，但失去了的東亞終於失去了。記者不禁想起了那個在松江車站　失竊了五千元而坐在地上「唉唉，家裏還有五個小孩哩，唉唉」痛哭的農民。這個病了的中國哪！記者的胸中起了一陣深刻莫名的感覺。</p>
<h3 id="c22">待米之羣 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>走出收票處時，記者以為記述萊糧撮運狀况的材料至此已經完了。豈知並未完畢。在外面正等着一大羣收買米販所帶値來的米的另一羣米販。他們恐怕是將它再轉賣給囤積者的吧。人數很多，他們追隨在歸來的米販後面，大聲問道：「米賣嗎？」</p>
<p>從松江到上海，記者在二等車的升降口仔細察看米糧搬入上海的實際情形。但這是從二等車看的，而且是日本人所見的狀况。如果中國幹練的記者走入三等車內，穿細入微地觀察，則更可深切痛感米糧對策的重大。雖則指定了十二處搬入口，米糧問題却祇有更趨重大吧</p>
<p>「奮戰的時候到了！」記者出了北站之後，感到報道戰士在米糧對策成功以前有寫關於米糧的文章的責任，依然不易從緊迫的心情中解放出來。</p>
<p>現在是我們應該注意米糧的時候，（究）（吉：譯自六月十二日「大陸新報」竹本特派員通訊）</p>

<h3 id="c27">陳彬龢詞 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>論由陳常委彬龢致詞略謂：　深信諸君對於近來本市市民生活之困難，極為開心。同時，市民亦十分關心警察之生活。如果市民生活得不到安定，則影藝治安匪淺。而警察生活得不到安定，則不能專心盡職，治安不上軌道。今年三月間，第一警察當局發起組織警察消費合作社，至目前為止，各界墊借資金已超過三千萬元，連同中儲華興復興各銀行借款，總數將達四千萬元，從此可證市民對於警察生活之改善，頗知稍盡棉薄。最近更再四向市政當局建議，對於警察經費，自下年度起，必須充分增加，以期整個解決警察生活間題。　過去英美人管理之「巡捕」，對於市民取對立態度，市民對之咸抱畏懼心理。本人曾三度赴日，目擊日本警察對待民衆和靄可親，充分流露警察與人民相處如一家人。自從大東亞戰爭發動以後，本市警政，有日本高級警官參加工作。吾人寄予深切期待，改變過去英美治理時代之種種不合理事態。　本市警察實有重新訓練之必要。在服務態度，忠勤職守方面，均應澈底改進。試舉一例，外白渡橋四川路橋等處，以往原由日本海軍設崗駐守，我們往來其間，無時無刻不見站立崗位，執行職守。現在改由警察駐守，往往不見崗位有人，甚至憑　眺景，猶之路人無異，而放棄崗位職守。所以，希望在日本專家指導之下，重新訓練，中心動職守，改善態度，深盼在日本國內所見之警察對人民和藹態度，在上海普遍實現。　警察消費合作社，原以改善警察生活為主旨，所以，該社工作，應以處理迅捷，實粵藝察生活為兩大原則。要求市政當局對於警察食糧充分配給，使之安定生活。　經濟保安處之成立，由五島先生担任處長，本市工商大為放心，因為五島先生公正廉潔，素為工商界推重。在上海目前環境中，經濟保安處成立，已感必要。過去經濟行政機稱設立，往往利未見而弊先見，或者弊多利少。希望經濟保安處注意及之。我們並有數點期待：第一，充分保護正當商人。第二，充分保護生產工廠。第三，重親中國工商界之習慣，特別在接觸時的態度和藹。第四，嚴厲制裁只顧私利的暴利主義者。同時，不僅對於中國人士如此，即日本人士，無論任何關係，均應一律秉公處置。　最後，可以順便報告者，諮詢委員會近正向當局建議　改變糧食配給方式，對於公務人員，警察，保安隊·交通職工，生產職工，以及一般勞動者儘先或增加配給。　無職業而並非上海篇人民，當局資助疏散返鄕，請保甲處特別注意。　市政常局從連籌款採　米糧及雜糧，開辦平　，對於上述第　項人員儘先平　。</p>
<h3 id="c28">渡正監詞 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>第一警察局渡副局長詞略謂：今承市政結詢委員會之邀請，我以警幹部人員的資格參加，深感榮幸。本人來滬三載，從事警察工作，目擊過去英美所管理下之警察，與人民對立之情形，竭力予以糾正，使人民與警察共同一致協力。次如過去上海成為恐怖都市，不良份子匿跡　日有發生恐惟行為，自保甲制度成立後，賴人民之協力合作，治安日漸改善。惟自上海租界返還中國後，閱時一战有餘，詎一般奸商之活躍，致使物價動達，因此警察之最大任務，首須確保治安，希望人民予以協力，促成安居樂業，今觀目前情形，與四十年前之日本明治維新時代相同。當時日政府聘請警察專家亨氏改善國內警察制度，今則上海警察由吾日人協助。本人既承中國政府之聘請，當協力中國警政，以樹立新中國之警察制度，此乃本人之重大責任。次乃本人期望者，冀盼今後本市一般人士，加以多多運絡，相互商討，對警察制度之改善，盡量提出，好在貴會諸君都為本市素孚衆望之名流，當樂予贊助者。此外關於提高警察之待過及生活問題，最近已提高百分之六十，惟値茲目前物價暴貴，當設法將廉價之物，充分配給警察。關於警察消費合作社，又承市民福利會協助，譯劃資金，本身已做到生活必需品之配給，業已向外埠採購大批米糧，供給警士，並配給家屬，最後對上海治安，亦已縝密計劃完備。</p>

<p>— 裕農</p>
<p>本市米價，每石竟達一萬數千元，為有世以來所未聞之米價，人心惶惶，大有不可終日之勢。推闕原因，不外戶口米之不能按期配給，若有若無，忽增忽減，旣不實布任何理由，以安人心；更無相常辦法，以資補救，使一般民衆以為配給制度之即將無形消減無疑，以致紛紛爭購黑市米為救濟，此其一。而自政府公布京進兩市食米臨時摧置綱要，及其第五條規定無運米護照入口者，以私米論一節，民衆多以為此後農民自種米穀，本可自由運入三五斗者，亦將受此限制，不能源源接濟，則市上所賴以救濟之黑市米，亦將大生問題，於是搜購尤急。而農民亦對所謂請領運米護照一點，莫明其妙，深恐一有錯誤，又將充公被罰，農民本為驚弓之烏，何敢嘗試，裏足不前，因此來源更稀，此其二。</p>
<p>所以補救之道，沐統會似應對症發藥，第一，須鼓勵採辦商之眅運，增加來源，而作合理之微購軍警米及戶口米，使戶口米得以按期配給（價格當然另定），以安人心。第三，農民之自由搬入米榖，不但當增加其數量至少至一石，並須在手續方面，予以簡單汝自由，無諭直接間接凡足以妨礙農民自由搬入米穀之任何手續，均應廢除，以增來源。茲讀米统會為米糧搬入滬市護照聲請辦法之通告，分甲乙丙三種，其丙種設明單篇專對五斗以下之農民搬入米榖使用，並限一日有效，隔日作廢一節，覽有商榷之必要。</p>
<p>第一原則旣為鼓勵農民自由搬入米殼，所限數量何其微小，何以必須有證明單，所證明者為何事，若欲證明其來歷，則旣至搬入口處，亦無從證明，若爲統計數字起見，不妨即在搬入口處派人登記己足，旣已入口，准其自由買責，更無證明之必要。況各種護照旣規定不眅任何費川，則在此紙張昂貴印刷原料缺乏之時，亦大可省此一筆開支。第二，農民搬運米殺入市，大都肩挑背負，徒步褕送，不但出售其米穀，同時亦等於出售其勞力時間，其入口處人必擁擠，若必須一一詢問，填發說明單，其手續之延緩，時問之浪費，將為何如。深信屆時不但有爭先凌亂情狀，恐必混水提魚弊賓業至，其結果非使農民盛覺絕大之病苦，即使其搬人米價成本倍增，似非鼓勵農民與抑平沐價之道。第三農民文盲者居多，且言語口齒不淸，所携米穀及所填證明單，極易發生錯誤，况負重徒步汗流交背之農民，對此證明單，更易遭遺失汝污損情事，其遇市內五步一崗，十步一警之盤查挑剔與留難，農民之痛苦將何如，其弊病有不堪言者。第四市內移動之米，旣有證明單之發，則所有移動之米，均將有證明單，是則戶口米將如何移動，而工廠團號等配發職工之補助米，又將如何移動。況證明單如果實行，沿途警捕對於執行此等職務最為勤嚴，勢皆將有袋米，無包不查，將來種種罪惡，似皆將假查證明單之名以行。</p>
<p>故照上述四點情形，對於證明單之發，似覺有弊無利，實可免除。至於米統會規定「民食米存量以三個月為限，逾限作囤積論罪」一節，觀其立法主旨，原在防止囤積投機，居奇暴利，未可厚幷。但我們以為合理之「積」與非法的「囤」，其問大有差別，不可一槪而論。「積穀防飢」古有明訓（告時各地均有積榖倉之設即本此意），則人民囚食口所需而存儲較多米糧，似不能即認其為囤積操縱，自屬可知。例如八口之家，其能力可儲食米六個月與一年者，或所在而有（但事實上食米除　羅西負米外，亦不能貯藏至半年之久）。時至今臼，正以其有準備遂不若一般無準備者之易於恐慌。即如此次米價騰貴至萬數千元之巨，其促成者大致皆爲日盼戶口米不得而無準備之家，其已有準備者不與也。否則羣相爭購，米價一蹴至五萬元，亦屬可能，事實具在，無從諒言。故當局似非但不應取締存儲，更當獎勵積穀，以減輕意外時期（如運轍交通突然發生問題等等）之嚴重性，更或在不得已時，向貯藏盟厚者賒借聍糧作一部份之救濟。救困血鄰，古有明訓，臨時征求，定有可能，故其存糧目的汝行為，確在防飢自用，並非囤積操縱，投機暴利，即爲合理的「稅」，雖超過三個月存量，亦不應以為罪。倘其目的及行爲確為囤積操縱投機暴利，使為非法的「囤」，其所囤之數量，飲不滿三個月，亦應處以囤積之罪，以符法理。且食糧存貯一經限制為三個月，逾限即為非法，是則家家戶戶必須經過嚴密檢查，一升之出入，即為牢獄之出入，而人口多少，年齡，長幼，食糧大小親友留餐等等，均成絕大問題，家宅從此多事，其流弊所至何堪設想，為政者不可不慎之於始。抑又有進者，今當局突然下令存糧限制三個月，並無猶豫期問，對於現在存糧在三個月以上者，其多餘之糧，倘依然保存則為犯逾限之罪，若即價貿，又坐團積暴利之罪，進亦罪，退亦罪，進退維罪，不知其將如何處置。粽上所述，存對限制一節，似可不必，况兩市米穀之不能久貯，更不能過雨李，己成天然之限制，更可不必有法令之規定，以　反致流弊。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Promoting the Consumption of Coarse Grains <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the black market price of rice has entered a state of stagnation. Even if it doesn't rise again, the current price poses a threat that is difficult for the average citizen, especially those in the salaried class, to cope with. The fluctuation of rice prices has continued for two weeks. During this period, most wealthy families either have stored grain or have not yet suffered directly from the high price of rice. However, ordinary households do not have more than a week's worth of stored grain. Therefore, the three meals a day from now on will be completely dependent on the current high-priced rice. The income of the salaried class is generally only three to five thousand yuan. What they earn in a month can only be exchanged for three to five "dou" (a unit of dry measure) of rice. How can they support their family life? How can they get through the years ahead?</p>
<p>Seven out of ten reasons for the high black market price of rice are man-made. The actual cost for farmers should not exceed three thousand yuan per "dan" (another unit of dry measure). What is most regrettable is that after the government announced the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" on May 24th, it did not simultaneously stipulate the maximum price for rice in the producing areas. This gave unscrupulous rice merchants in various localities the opportunity to speculate and make exorbitant profits by taking the opportunity to raise prices. The original intention of the government authorities was to fully consider the interests of the hard-working farmers by adding reasonable profits based on actual costs. Unexpectedly, the amount of rice stored in the rice-producing areas was actually more in the hands of rice merchants than farmers. Unscrupulous rice merchants took the opportunity to succeed. Therefore, once the government announced the new measures, they raised prices wildly. In the case of our city, they colluded with unscrupulous rice merchants in the producing areas, echoed each other, and exhausted their ability to speculate and make exorbitant profits. The black market skyrocketed and became uncontrollable. After verifying the evidence against these speculators who only care about private interests, they should be immediately punished with wartime capital punishment as a warning to those who come after.</p>
<p>For the present plan, on the positive side, we have repeatedly suggested countermeasures to dredge the sources of supply in order to stabilize rice prices. On the negative side, we must promote the consumption of coarse grains to reduce the need for rice. In terms of nutritional value, coarse grains are better than white rice. In many non-rice-producing areas, people who use coarse grains as their daily food generally have stronger physiques. For example, corn and naked barley can be ground into flour for cooking rice. Shanghai people call corn flour "six-grain flour" and think it is food for livestock. However, in the areas of Jiangbei that specialize in corn production, people use it as a regular food from July to April of the following year, relying on it for a living for three years out of the year. The method of making rice is to grind corn into flour, grind and sift it evenly two or three times, the flour is extremely fine, mix it in boiling water, and it will mature into rice in a short while. It is originally very fragrant and delicious. If you mix two to five percent of it with white rice, it will be even more fragrant and suitable. If you eat the same amount of corn flour rice compared to white rice rice, corn flour rice is more filling. Secondly, naked barley is also one of the main types of coarse grains. From April to July every year, it is also a regular food for people in the producing areas, and it can also be ground into flour for cooking rice. Wheat ground into flour can only be used as noodle food and cannot be cooked as rice. Southern people are not accustomed to noodle meals every meal, so the application of naked barley is actually greater than wheat. Rice-producing areas originally use rice as a regular food. Most of Central and Southern China are rice-producing areas, so they do not know the value of corn and naked barley, and even look down on them as used for livestock. Now the environment is changing and white rice is difficult to obtain. We hope that Shanghai citizens will pay attention to the equal value of coarse grains and eat them together. We hope that the authorities will purchase coarse grains such as corn on a large scale and distribute them as flour in place of rice. However, when purchasing, you must pay attention to dryness and cleanliness, and do not allow adulteration with water or mildew. When grinding flour, you must strive for fineness to maintain the value of corn flour as a food and arouse the interest and habit of citizens to eat it together. In this way, the degree of demand for white rice can be reduced, and there can be more ways to regulate food for the people.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the municipal authorities will promptly organize price stabilization, and implement it at the same time as coarse grain distribution, so that the grain price will receive real pressure and gradually return.</p>

<p>Hankou, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese troops, in the general offensive against Changsha, braved heavy artillery fire from the Chongqing troops' artillery positions on Mount Yuelu and pressed towards Changsha. On the morning of the 17th, they crossed the Yuehan Railway, attacked the southern side of Changsha, and occupied a corner of it. Since the Japanese army carried out the first and second Changsha operations, the Chongqing army has built solid defensive positions in the area, making it a major fortress. The Chongqing army's resistance is extremely tenacious. However, the Japanese troops continue to attack fiercely, and the hardship is beyond description. Fierce street fighting is currently taking place in Changsha City.</p>
<p>(Another dispatch) The Japanese troops attacking Changsha broke into the city wall in the southeast corner of Changsha City at 8 a.m. on the 18th. The Japanese army has completely surrounded the city for eight kilometers, so the situation of the Chongqing 4th Army, 2nd Division is in imminent danger. The Chongqing army continues to provide stubborn cover with artillery fire from Mount Yuelu and its east side Tianma Mountain artillery positions. However, with the cooperation of the Japanese ground troops and Japanese aircraft, the airspace over Changsha has been completely suppressed, and the Chongqing army positions are bombarded with huge shells. The Changsha battle for defense has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The advanced troops of the Japanese Central China Army have now reached the outer city of Changsha, the Chongqing 4th Army's base. On the night of the 14th, the Japanese army first occupied the strong first-line position of the Chongqing army led by Ma Jingchuan on the Yuelu Mountain side of the Changsha River. At the same time, other troops also attacked and occupied the Chongqing army's first-line position on the south side of Yuelu Mountain in the early morning of the 16th, braving the rain. Later, on the evening of the same day, they occupied the forward position guarding the outside of Changsha City. The Chongqing 4th Army, which is currently defending Changsha, includes four divisions, including the 96th Division and the Provisional 54th Division. They have built heavy artillery positions and mountain artillery positions based on the natural terrain, as well as a defensive embankment known as the "iron wall," attempting to defend Changsha to the death. Changsha, an important stronghold in the Chongqing 9th War Zone, has been under the third Japanese operation since the Changsha operation in January of the year before last and is now within the scope of the Japanese army. The sound of artillery is deafening, and the two sides are engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Fierce Attack on Tianma Mountain</p>
<p>Hunan Japanese Army Frontline Base, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Changsha, the largest stronghold in the 9th War Zone, is now completely surrounded. Although the Chongqing 4th Army wants to break through the Japanese army's encirclement, it is desperately resisting, but the Japanese army is bravely advancing through the Chongqing army's machine guns and mountain artillery fire on Tianma Mountain, the outpost position of Yuelu Mountain. Tianma Mountain is located on the opposite bank of the southern end of Changsha City, a hill with an elevation of 167 meters and a circumference of 2.5 kilometers, forming the outer perimeter position of Yuelu Mountain. Attacking from the south of Changsha, overlooking the Japanese army, it can be seen at a glance, making it a strategically advantageous point for the enemy. The capture of Tianma Mountain can control Changsha's lifeline. Under the joint efforts of the elite Japanese air and ground forces, the final fierce attack on the mountain has begun.</p>
<p>Advising the Chongqing Army in the City to Ceasefire</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base, 17th (Central News Agency dispatch) Before launching the attack on the Chongqing 4th Army, the Japanese army, in order to avoid war damage to Changsha City, preserve the scenic spots and historic sites, and avoid harming innocent civilians, has been distributing leaflets by aircraft since the 17th, advising the Chongqing army in the city to cease fire. Before the Japanese army operated in Henan, it could not bear to see the ancient capital of Luoyang suffer war damage, and it had previously endured operational disadvantages. Now it is taking such just measures for Changsha again.</p>
<p>The Chongqing Army's Retreat Route Has Been Cut Off</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan front is as follows: The Japanese army has circled around to the east of Changsha and is advancing fiercely. It is currently attacking Lukou Station (a key point where the Yuehan Railway and Xianggui Railway connect, closest to Hengyang). The Chongqing Military Commission has announced that it is continuing to fight north of Lukou. Although Changsha is still in the hands of the Chongqing army, the retreat route from the city has been cut off by the Japanese army, so the Chongqing army defending the city is in despair.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Southern Local Chieftains Cooperate with the Japanese Army and Voluntarily Increase Production <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Balikpapan, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) When the Japanese army entered Tarakan and Balikpapan in South Borneo, the first local chieftain of Borneo, Tengarun Hou, and other local chieftains quickly went to Balikpapan to express the natives' determination to pledge allegiance to Japan. When the Netherlands was in power, they were deprived of all education from their hands and squeezed to an unlimited extent. They could only endure and pray for the arrival of a god of salvation. At this time, the Japanese army suddenly descended before them, shattering the Dutch forces in one fell swoop. Therefore, they were all extremely excited. In the more than two years of military administration that followed, they promoted their education in order to make them self-sufficient in food and clothing, and did not hesitate to give them any assistance. Japan has never had the oppression and racial prejudice of the British, Americans, and Dutch against other nations, and always uses deep sincerity to guide them to develop upward. Therefore, Tengarun Hou and Bulungan Hou are now extremely grateful for Japan's gentle guidance and are cooperating with the Japanese army to complete the Greater East Asia War. The local chieftains are also working with the natives to develop war resources and increase production.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Ruthless Judgment <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>— Hermit of Jiangnan</p>
<p>Recently, Britain and the United States have been unsparingly attacking Chongqing, criticizing it for being unmodern, lacking power, not inclined to democratization, and lacking internal unity. On the other hand, Wallace, as the U.S. Vice President, was sent to Chongqing. The United States has also signed a new credit agreement with Chongqing, promising to increase assistance under the Lend-Lease Act. Britain has also followed suit, praising Chongqing as "one of the four powers." She also used a cleverer way, pointing out the nature of the many faults of feudal Chongqing without saying much, which is precisely what makes Chongqing a powerful factor. These are all the means of "coercion" and "inducement" that Britain and the United States have habitually used against Chongqing.</p>
<p>However, the Soviet magazine "War and the Working Class," published this month in Moscow, examined and analyzed Chongqing's resistance, and immediately criticized: "Chongqing's elite troops suffered the greatest defeat in the Henan campaign. The Chongqing authorities used the backwardness of China's economy, the lack of military equipment, and the inadequacy of British and American military assistance as reasons to explain this disastrous failure. Many plans have been drafted in the anti-Japanese war zone, but none of them are for building the military and industrial foundations of Chongqing." Chongqing's Kuomintang recently held a secret 12th plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, passing a plan for revival, and this criticism was published after it was disclosed by the Chongqing Standing Committee.</p>
<p>The magazine also stated in another section: "There is a strong tendency of defeatism among Chongqing officials. In the past two years, twenty commanders have led their soldiers to join the peace camp. Seeing this, it is not surprising that the Chongqing army was defeated in Henan. Under the current situation in Chongqing, there is a reason for it."</p>
<p>After the Henan campaign, fierce battles broke out near Changsha, Hunan, and the Chongqing army retreated steadily. But as the magazine pointed out: The military defeat, "Under the current situation in Chongqing, there is a reason for it," so that result was expected.</p>
<p>This detailed analysis by the Soviet magazine is completely different from the "coercion and inducement" policy of Britain and the United States. Its observation is realistic. The criticism of Chongqing by Britain and the United States is to drive Chongqing to fight to the end for its war and political interests. On the contrary, the criticism of the Soviet publications, purely from the perspective of a third party, pointed out the mistakes of Chongqing. We do not want to say much about the analysis made by "War and the Working Class," but we want to point out that when the world war has progressed to a decisive stage, and this word is spoken by the Soviet publications, it is really a sharp stab straight into the heart of Chongqing. In the early days of Chongqing's resistance, the Soviet Union praised Chongqing as a hero, sometimes even with a legendary color. We ask the Soviet Union to recall that scene once again.</p>
<p>"War and the Working Class" was founded in June of last year. Since that time, only two articles in the magazine have involved Chongqing. The first was written by Loguf, a sharp news reporter who was a Shanghai correspondent for TASS. The article was published last August and discussed Chongqing's resistance strength. The second is the one mentioned above. These two articles did not unexpectedly relax their fists for the defeated fighters, nor did they show the tendency observed by the Moscow publications in the early days of Chongqing's resistance. What is the reason?</p>
<p>Along this line, it is not difficult to gradually resolve the rights of Japan and the Soviet Union in the Far East and the border incidents in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang Province. In an essay commenting on the Japan-Soviet fishery treaty, the magazine said: "We must note that the conclusion of this treaty clearly indicates that the two countries are willing to abide by the spirit of the neutrality treaty and resolve all major issues between the two countries equally." This remark should be noted by Chongqing's supporters. Judging from the path Chongqing has taken, the Chongqing regime is meaningless to the Soviet Union. Although the Moscow Declaration has recognized Chongqing as one of the four powers, the Kremlin only regards Chongqing as a local regime.</p>
<p>The development of the war is progressing at an astonishing speed. At this time, a strong and fair neighbor makes this ruthless judgment on Chongqing, which was once listed as one of the four powers, which is what the pro-war elements in Chongqing should think deeply about.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Japanese Army Employs Clever Tactics in Northern Burma Chongqing Counterattack Fails on the Salween River Front <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Chongqing army on the Salween River front has lost a large number of soldiers and weapons, and its subsequent attacks have been in vain. The Japanese army's defense is as solid as an iron wall, and the Japanese army's operations are particularly clever, so the Chongqing army's attacks can only be met with failure and gain nothing. On the 10th of this month, the Chongqing army attempted to recapture the Longling area, and attacked with about two divisions. The Japanese army immediately counterattacked, forcing them to retreat eastward. The Japanese army also annihilated hundreds of Chongqing soldiers who attacked near the Datoujie area. In this battle, the Chongqing army left 233 bodies behind, and the Japanese army captured mortars, heavy machine guns, automatic rifles, and countless other military supplies. Also, at noon on the 14th, the Japanese army troops and the Chongqing troops attacking Jiangxuanjie engaged in a fierce artillery battle. The Chongqing mountain guns, field guns, etc., were all destroyed. The Chongqing army, which was collecting supplies airdropped, was also severely attacked, so the Chongqing army's attempt has vanished. At this time, the enemy in the Myitkyina area also launched an attack in response in order to seize the northern Burma position. However, new Japanese elites also arrived one after another. According to the battle results ascertained on the 12th, the enemy corpses alone numbered 2,500.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Germany Attacks the Heart of Britain With New Weapons Emerging Endlessly British Authorities Urgently Seek to Reform Air Defense Institutions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News: Another secret weapon of Germany may appear soon. German authorities said that after the German Meteor bombs have been constantly bombing London and Southern England, another new weapon will come out to assist. Seventy percent of the enemy troops currently invading Europe are Americans rather than British. However, the bombing of London by the German new weapon is precisely hitting the heart of Britain, and it is impossible to escape. London has announced the number of tons of bombs dropped on Germany every day. It is said that more than 50,000 tons of bombs have been dropped in Berlin alone. Germany will now repay them double. It is heard that the personnel releasing the meteor bombs have written the words "Revenge for Cologne" and "Retaliation for Berlin" on each bomb with powder.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to London reports: The British government is deeply embarrassed by Germany's retaliatory attacks with unmanned aircraft and knows that the usual air defense organization is ineffective. It has decided to reform rapidly. It was announced on the evening of the 17th that the British Southern anti-aircraft gun teams should innovate their organization in order to intercept the German unmanned aircraft, and concentrate the maximum firepower to try to block them before the unmanned aircraft reach densely populated areas. It is heard that the unmanned aircraft have no ordinary aircraft accompanying them.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Mysterious Weapon's Structure and Power <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) Huitong News: Unmanned aircraft and meteor bombs were originally manufactured by a small number of workers. These workers have been isolated from the outside world for many months to prevent the leakage of secrets. These new weapons attacking London and Southern England have been effective, and are now being manufactured on a large scale.</p>
<p>Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German unmanned aircraft have plunged the British people into extreme terror. As for what they really are, the German military has declared that they are new types of explosive bodies of the largest caliber. A reporter from a Swiss newspaper reported that this rocket-type aircraft has the explosive power to destroy atoms. It is an automatic explosive bomb remotely controlled by radio waves, dropped from high altitudes, and fired at the target after hundreds of kilometers. This type of bomb has wings on both sides, and its appearance is very similar to an aircraft. The British newspapers are making all kinds of speculations about what it is. It is said that there are two shapes, one is about six to eight yards long with wings on both sides, and the other is slightly smaller than an ordinary fighter plane and similar to a free-style aircraft. Although its explosive power is still unknown, there are two possibilities due to the different methods of manipulation. One is that it is manually controlled by radio from a special aircraft in the rear, and the other is that it is fired by artillery from a base on the Atlantic coast, about 30 to 40 kilometers from the coast. How it is manipulated is still a question. What impact this automatic aircraft will have in this war is an important question. However, why did Germany not use this novel weapon earlier? Perhaps because of technical difficulties, or in view of the importance of the Normandy battle, it was used to exert strategic effects. If so, the German army will definitely supply it together with other weapons for a long time. The German government authorities issued a statement yesterday, asking that this kind of weapon is not for one or two demonstrations, and will continue to be used in combat operations in the future. This shows that the German military authorities have considerable confidence in the quality and quantity of this weapon.</p>

<p>Allied Forces Landing on the West Coast of Cotentin</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): On the thirteenth day of the anti-Axis forces' landing in France, they have occupied some areas but have yet to secure a suitable base for advancing against German defense lines. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces are making every effort to seize major seaports. Having failed to capture Le Havre, they have no choice but to attack Cherbourg. The plan to take Cherbourg and cut off the Cotentin Peninsula is being launched simultaneously, but capturing Cherbourg will come at a heavy cost. General Bradley is fully engaged in the plan to cut off the peninsula. After reaching Vicomte on Friday, he used all of the American army's reserves the next day to continue the westward advance. Fierce fighting is currently underway, with the German army putting up strong resistance, but they are fighting with a relatively small number of troops. The anti-Axis forces are increasing pressure on the Carentan-to-Périers highway, but progress is minimal. The left flank of the U.S. First Army launched an attack towards Saint-Lô between Ville and Torigni-sur-Vire the day before yesterday, but were met by German forces on the outskirts of the city and suffered a hasty retreat. The right flank of the British Second Army at Caumont and the left flank east of the Orne River are both adopting defensive positions, with troops east of Caumont having retreated to Livry. The British Second Army's central forces are attacking Tilly-sur-Seulles, but are also being blocked by German forces. There has been no change in the battle situation on the Tilly-sur-Seulles and Caen front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): The anti-Axis headquarters announced that the anti-Axis spearhead forces have reached the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, near Barneville.</p>

<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch via Hai Tong News Agency): Well-informed sources here believe that it is not impossible for American forces from the Vicomte area to reach the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula, as there are very few German troops stationed in that area. However, the general view is that even if the American forces reach the west coast, it will not affect the overall war situation, as there are no important transportation facilities in the area west of Vicomte. It has also been learned that a large army is stationed in the Cherbourg fortress, and it contains a large amount of military supplies and food, in case the area is cut off.</p>

The enemy also attempted to break through towards Perugia but was repulsed. However, the enemy reinforced with more tanks, and it is expected that the fighting there will soon reach its peak. Lake Trasimeno, with an area of 129.6 square li, is the site of the meeting between Hannibal and the Roman Empire in 217 BC. As for the German army's right flank at the city of Grosseto, the withdrawal has been completed, and the American forces are advancing north from there.</p>

<p>Makassar, 19th (Central News Agency Dispatch): The trans-Celebes highway connecting North and South Celebes was opened to traffic on the 8th of this month. From now on, various materials will be continuously transported from Central Celebes. Although a certain area in the interior of the island was once isolated, it will now serve as a crucial hub for the collection and distribution of materials, centered on Central Celebes, since the completion of the road. The current situation there is as follows:</p>
<p>Industry: The production of both paddy rice and dry rice in the area can exceed self-sufficiency. Timber and livestock production are the leading industries. Before the war, the production of ebony was 250 tons and ironwood was 375 tons, with a total value of 270,000 guilders. Resources for exporting resins are also abundant. There are tens of thousands of livestock, including cattle, wild goats, and pigs. The aborigines have stated that if leather is needed, it can be supplied in large quantities locally. There is only one existing lumber mill. To actively enhance combat power, a new one, similar in size to the existing mill, is being built and is expected to be completed in September of this year. At the same time, it is planned to purchase a large number of circular saws, band saws, and other equipment. In addition, lumber mills operated by overseas Chinese are being mobilized to expand lumber production to three times the current amount. There are several existing shipbuilding docks, and all of the newly added ones will be completed by the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e19">What I Saw on the Train <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>I boarded the train that departed from Songjiang at 8:50 PM. To observe the actual situation of rice transportation, I occupied the elevator entrance outside the carriage, keeping my eyes wide open, fearing that I might miss a person or a bag of rice. It was already dusk, and the station staff's flashlight flickered intermittently in the moonlight. Among the two second-class carriages, a news reporter stood watchfully, looking for material for his report. At this time, they, the small-scale traders, began to act quickly and boldly. From the opposite side of the platform, they were busy loading bag after bag of rice. I had just seen a man accepting rice bags by the carriage door when another man used that man's shoulders and head as a stepping stone, agilely climbing onto the roof of the carriage like an ape. He probably loaded about four bags of rice. Suddenly, the flashlight flashed. "It's already so crowded, there's no room for more people! And they're still going up!" the station staff said, walking away. I wanted to open the door to see the overall loading situation. I grabbed the handle and pulled, but with a creak, the door remained closed. There was a reason why it wouldn't open. It turned out that a child had hooked his body onto the door hinge on the steps of the entrance. This is my territory, and I won't let the enemy peek in. He was stubbornly guarding it along with the rice.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman in her thirties or forties carrying two bags of rice came over, stuffing a bag of about four dou (a unit of dry measure) of rice deep into the seat of the second-class carriage opposite, and then slipping into the second-class carriage herself. Later, the conductor discovered it, dragged it out, and asked, "Whose is this?" Everyone said, "I don't know." The conductor got angry and dragged the bags of rice outside the carriage. The man on the roof of the carriage happened to dangle his feet down, leisurely smoking a cigarette. "Ahem, you're really too reckless, rice thief!" The conductor tapped the man's feet with a small stick. The man quickly retracted his feet like a frog landing on land, quietly hiding his body. A feeling of mixed joy and sorrow welled up in the reporter's heart. "Today's work is 99% done, all that's left is to pay 30 yuan for luggage at the ticket office in Shanghai. Haha, I can make another profit!" He was probably thinking this with a smile in a safe place.</p>
<h3 id="e20">What I Heard on the Train <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>I must report the real feeling of the rice train to the readers faithfully—</p>
<p>The reporter engaged in a verbal battle with a woman. Sparks flew from under the train, and the wheels rumbled. The man was a reporter, the woman was a rice trader; the reporter felt itchy in his heart.</p>
<p>"Do you have a ticket?" the reporter asked in awkward Shanghainese.</p>
<p>"Of course I do, sir. But even if I do, this is the border between second and third class, and the conductor might come and make a fuss, I'm really worried!" she said.</p>
<p>"Where are you going? How many dou did you buy?"</p>
<p>"To Fengjing, only three dou. She sat on one bag herself, and she let the reporter sit on the other bag. In the past, Mito Komon was happy to be hit by an old woman for sitting on a straw bag, but in the elevator entrance of the train, there was no one to hit the reporter. The reporter sat down peacefully and started talking to her about various things. Because I couldn't understand everything she said, I felt like I was entering a tiger's den without catching the tiger cubs. It was truly regrettable. The gist of her words was as follows:</p>
<p>"I started selling rice two months ago. My husband died in Ningbo after the incident, leaving behind two children, one twelve years old and the other eight years old, neither of whom have attended school. We have a total of five partners. If five or six people work together in this business, it's easier to take care of each other. Although the monthly income is said to be over 10,000 yuan, it's not actually that much, because we don't run every day, and even though the price of rice has gone up, the train fare and 'expenses' have also increased. So even though income has increased, expenses have also increased. At first, we only ran to Songjiang, but now we run to Fengjing, because rice is cheaper in Fengjing. The rice is bought from the rice shops in Fengjing. The rice shops buy from the farmers, and we buy from the rice shops. The rice shops are very shrewd, they only want to raise the price of rice. We can only make money if the price of rice in Shanghai is especially high and the price of rice in Fengjing is especially low. People in this world always want to make a profit for themselves. The most difficult thing is that there are fewer third-class carriages, so it's not easy to get on. And the railway company stipulates that riding without a ticket or riding second class with a third-class ticket will be fined ten times the fare, which is really difficult! But if you have money, it's okay to pay it. But if you take the rice to offset the fine, wouldn't that be too outrageous? We do this business out of necessity, wouldn't it be better if the railway didn't make a fuss? The biggest difficulty in this business is getting on the train. If it were easy to get on the train, there would definitely be more people running this business. Of course, I'm going again tomorrow."</p>
<p>She took out a cigarette and asked the reporter for a light. Her cigarette seemed to be a "three-gun" brand! The woman with a purplish-red face, smoking and talking about rice. This impression was too deep.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Rice Thieves <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The train arrived at Xujiahui. Many rice and people got off. It was the same at West Shanghai. Xujiahui, West Shanghai, and North Station, there were a total of about 500 people getting off at these three stations. The warriors on the roof of the carriage also climbed down from above when the train approached West Shanghai. His partners helped him down, one by one opening the top of the carriage. In addition to the bags of rice that were carried down, he was also wearing a "rice vest." Rice on his back, rice on his chest, truly a rice bulletproof vest. I think this big man was carrying a total of about two shi (a unit of dry measure) of rice.</p>
<p>At West Shanghai Station, a major incident suddenly occurred. Just as the reporter was chatting excitedly with the woman who was getting off at North Station, he suddenly heard a woman's laughter. Looking over there, it was a beautiful young girl, about eighteen or nineteen years old, nicely dressed, although she was crying very sadly, she did not lose her beauty. The conductor walked out of the carriage and ran into another second-class carriage. It seemed that a bad person had stolen four dou of rice that had been placed there, and had gotten off the train in Xujiahui with one foot first. The girl, crying, recounted the illegal behavior of the railway staff. Two young railway police officers and a man who seemed to be the conductor's assistant, seemed to have shown their manhood because of the beautiful girl's coquettish cries, and the three of them went to ask the Japanese conductor to come. The conductor came, but the lost item did not appear. The girl, full of anger, attacked the conductor. The conductor, unable to do anything, had no choice but to say "damn it," and adopted the Thirty-Six Stratagems and ran away in a state of disarray. The remaining three young men and the beautiful girl searched carefully in that area again, but the lost item was finally lost. The reporter couldn't help but think of the farmer at Songjiang Station who had lost 5,000 yuan and was sitting on the ground crying, "Alas, there are still five children at home, alas." This sick China! A deep and inexplicable feeling arose in the reporter's heart.</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Waiting Crowd for Rice <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>When I walked out of the ticket office, the reporter thought that the material for describing the situation of transporting rice to Shanghai was finished. Little did I know that it was not over. Outside, a large crowd of another group of rice merchants was waiting to buy the rice brought by the rice traders. They were probably going to resell it to hoarders. There were many people, and they followed behind the returning rice traders, asking loudly, "Are you selling rice?"</p>
<p>From Songjiang to Shanghai, the reporter carefully observed the actual situation of rice being transported into Shanghai from the elevator entrance of the second-class carriage. But this was from the perspective of the second-class carriage, and it was the situation seen by a Japanese person. If a capable Chinese reporter were to enter the third-class carriage and observe with great detail, he would be able to deeply feel the importance of the rice policy. Even though twelve import points have been designated, the rice problem will only become more serious.</p>
<p>"The time for fighting has come!" After leaving North Station, the reporter felt that, before the success of the rice policy, the reporter's responsibility to write about rice had not been lifted from his pressing mood.</p>
<p>Now is the time we should pay attention to rice. (End) (Translation by Ji, from the June 12th "Mainland News" dispatch by Special Correspondent Takemoto)</p>

<h3 id="e23">Municipal Advisory Committee Hosts Police Chiefs for Cordial Discussion on Police Duties and Compensation <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Municipal Advisory Committee has been actively assisting the municipal government's work in various areas. Yesterday afternoon (the 19th) at 4:30 PM, the committee hosted senior officials from the city's First and Second Police Bureaus at the First District Public Office for a discussion on issues such as the duties and compensation of the city's police. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e24">Officials from Both Bureaus <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>From the First Police Bureau, Deputy Bureau Chiefs Masao Watanabe and Chengde Su, Chief Secretary Rifu Sun, General Affairs Section Chief Ji Lin, Deputy Section Chiefs Nikko Nakano and Zhiliang Xue, Special Higher Police Section Chief and Economic Security Section Chief Shigeru Goshima, Deputy Section Chief Yunbo Yao, Administrative Section Chief Qi Lv, Deputy Section Chief Watanabe, Judicial Section Chief Shiyu Li, Deputy Section Chief Kenjiro Kan, Baojia Section Chief Wu Xian, Deputy Section Chief Mitsuharu Shigeta, Fire Department Chief Kiyomi Ide, Deputy Section Chiefs Guocan Xia and Longquan Chen, Police Section Chief Huimo Yao, Training Section Chief Kenkichi Ninomiya, and chiefs of the Huangpu, Laozha, Xinzha, Jing'an, Jiangning, Putuo, Hongkou, West Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Xinshijie, Tilanqiao, Yulin, Yangshupu, Taishan, Lujiawan, Changshu, Huashan, and Changning Branch Bureaus attended. From the Second Police Bureau, Chief Shao Jieren, Secretary Chief Yitang Shi, Section Chiefs Yuzhai Zhang, Benyuan Yao, Pei Chu, Chief Inspector Jisheng Chen, Shaosheng Zhu, Delin Wang, Inspection Section Chief Shaoyi Guo, Liang Chen, Police Brigade Chief Tingdong Wang, Detective Brigade Chief Qiutan Su, Water Patrol Brigade Chief Dianjia Zhang, and chiefs of the Municipal Center, Zhonghua Road, Xieqiao, Hubei, Yulin Road, Yimiao, Xujiahui, Zhabei, Dongchang Road, Yangsi, and Gaoqiao Branch Bureaus attended, totaling over one hundred people.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Details of the Discussion <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The Advisory Committee was represented by Standing Committee Director Sihao Li, Standing Committee members Kanghou Lin, Jinxian Zhao, Riping Chen, Benhe Chen, Kangyuan Xiang, and Kailiang Shen. Committee member Kanghou Lin presided over the meeting, which began promptly. First, Director Li explained that he was unable to attend due to illness and requested Lin to chair the meeting in his stead and report on the current status of the Advisory Committee's work. Lin then elaborated on the work of the Advisory Committee since its establishment and the purpose of inviting the attendees for discussion. Subsequently, Committee member Benhe Chen expressed his hope for future police-civilian cooperation and provided his views on improving police compensation and the Economic Security Section. Then, Deputy Bureau Chief Watanabe, Bureau Chief Fu, and Economic Security Section Chief Goshima successively expressed their aspirations to fulfill the police's natural duty of protecting the people and to do their utmost for local security. Finally, acting Chairman Lin expressed his gratitude on behalf of all the citizens to the chiefs of both police bureaus for their enthusiasm in defending the region. Tea and refreshments were then served to all attendees, and the gathering concluded amicably after two hours.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Speech by Kanghou Lin <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Kanghou Lin said in his speech: "We are holding a tea party today, and we are very grateful for the presence of senior officials from both bureaus. The main work of our committee has been disclosed in the newspapers. First, we discussed the issue of daily necessities, as well as issues such as finance, education, and rural security. Today's invitation to you is directly related to you, that is, the security issue that you all want to discuss. Although the Security Committee of our committee has not yet started work, we sincerely hope that the senior officials of the police bureau will cooperate with us, exchange ideas, and make Shanghai's security more substantial. This is the common desire of our committee and the police authorities. Secondly, since its establishment, our committee has been deeply concerned about the police's compensation and the current status of the work of the Economic Security Section, and hopes that all relevant officials will express their opinions. I recall that when I first met Deputy Bureau Chief Watanabe, I mentioned that the police in the West are best managed in Germany, and in the East, Japan is the most complete. Now, with the cooperation of Japanese police officers and our country's police officers in this city, we will be able to rival the police in Germany and Japan in the future. I also hope that we can meet often in the future and review each other. At the time of the Greater East Asia War, if security is poor, it will have a significant impact on the war. This is the first time we have hosted you, and we represent the people's sincere hope. Thank you for your hard work."</p>
<h3 id="e27">Speech by Benhe Chen <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Standing Committee member Benhe Chen said in his speech: "I firmly believe that you are very aware of the recent difficulties in the lives of the citizens of this city. At the same time, the citizens are also very concerned about the lives of the police. If the lives of the citizens are not stable, it will affect the security of the city. And if the lives of the police are not stable, they cannot concentrate on their duties, and security will not be on track. In March of this year, the First Police Bureau initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative, and so far, the funds borrowed from all sectors have exceeded 30 million yuan. Together with loans from the Central Reserve Bank, the China Hsing Bank, and the Fuxing Bank, the total will reach 40 million yuan. This proves that the citizens are willing to do their part to improve the lives of the police. Recently, we have repeatedly suggested to the municipal authorities that police funding must be fully increased from the next year onwards in order to completely resolve the issue of police living conditions. In the past, the 'patrolmen' managed by the British and Americans took an antagonistic attitude towards the citizens, and the citizens were afraid of them. I have been to Japan three times and witnessed that Japanese police officers treat the people kindly and show that the police and the people are like one family. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, senior Japanese police officers have participated in the police work of this city. We have high expectations that they will change the unreasonable situations of the past era of British and American rule. The police in this city really need to be retrained. Their service attitude and their loyalty to their duties should be thoroughly improved. To give an example, the Waibaidu Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and other places were originally guarded by the Japanese Navy. When we passed by, we always saw them standing at their posts and performing their duties. Now that the police are stationed there, we often don't see anyone at their posts, and they are even just standing there looking at the scenery, just like passers-by, abandoning their posts. Therefore, we hope that under the guidance of Japanese experts, they will be retrained to be loyal to their duties and improve their attitude. We deeply hope that the kind attitude of the police towards the people that we have seen in Japan will be universally realized in Shanghai. The police consumer cooperative was originally intended to improve the lives of the police. Therefore, the work of the cooperative should be based on two major principles: handling matters quickly and truly improving the lives of the police. We request that the municipal authorities fully allocate food to the police to ensure a stable life. The establishment of the Economic Security Section, with Mr. Goshima as the director, has greatly reassured the business community in this city, because Mr. Goshima is fair and honest and has always been respected by the business community. In the current environment in Shanghai, the establishment of the Economic Security Section is necessary. In the past, the establishment of economic and administrative organizations often had more drawbacks than benefits, or more drawbacks than benefits. We hope that the Economic Security Section will pay attention to this. We also have several expectations: First, fully protect legitimate merchants. Second, fully protect production factories. Third, respect the customs of the Chinese business community, especially the attitude when dealing with them. Fourth, severely punish profiteers who only care about their own interests. At the same time, not only should Chinese people be treated this way, but Japanese people, regardless of their relationship, should be treated equally. Finally, I can also report that the Advisory Committee is currently suggesting to the authorities that they change the food distribution method and give priority or increase the allocation to civil servants, police, security teams, transportation workers, production workers, and general laborers. For people who are unemployed and are not natives of Shanghai, the authorities will provide assistance to evacuate them back to their hometowns. Please pay special attention to the Baojia Section. The municipal government is raising funds to purchase rice and grains and is opening up rice shops. The above-mentioned personnel will be given priority at the shops.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Statement by Supervisor Du Zheng <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Director Du Zheng of the First Police Bureau stated, in summary: "I am honored to participate in this Municipal Government Settlement Inquiry Committee as a police executive. I have been working in Shanghai for three years, and during this time, I have witnessed the antagonism between the police under the management of the British and Americans in the past and the people. I have been making every effort to correct this and to ensure that the people and the police are united and cooperate. Furthermore, Shanghai used to be a city of terror, with criminals hiding, and frightening incidents occurring daily. Since the establishment of the Baojia system, and thanks to the cooperation of the people, public security has gradually improved. However, since the return of the Shanghai concessions to China, more than a year has passed. Unfortunately, the activities of some unscrupulous merchants have led to rising prices. Therefore, the most important task of the police is to ensure public security, and I hope that the people will cooperate to promote peaceful and prosperous lives. I see the current situation as similar to that of Japan during the Meiji Restoration forty years ago. At that time, the Japanese government hired police expert Mr. Henry to improve the domestic police system. Now, the Shanghai police are being assisted by Japanese personnel. Since I have been hired by the Chinese government, I should cooperate with Chinese police affairs to establish a new Chinese police system. This is my important responsibility. Next, I hope that in the future, the general public of this city will actively communicate, discuss, and make suggestions for the improvement of the police system. I am sure that the gentlemen of this committee, who are all prominent figures in this city, will be happy to support this. In addition, regarding the issue of improving the treatment and living conditions of the police, salaries have recently been increased by 60 percent. However, given the current high prices, we should find ways to provide affordable goods to the police. Regarding the police consumer cooperative, we have also received assistance from the Civic Welfare Association in securing funds, and we have already begun distributing daily necessities. We have purchased large quantities of rice from other regions to supply to the police officers and their families. Finally, we have also completed a comprehensive plan for Shanghai's public security."</p>
<h3 id="e29">Statement by Lu Ying <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Director Lu Ying of the Second Police Bureau stated, in summary: "The situations of the First Police Bureau and our bureau are different. Before the incident, the existence of the concessions led to various differences. However, even after the incident and the return of the concessions, although the names have been unified, there are still slight differences in practice. I have been in charge for six years, and I have been serving the police force with a sense of sacrifice. Over the years, I have gradually improved the facilities, and I have received mutual assistance from the Allied agencies and colleagues in the First Police Bureau, which has led to today's achievements. There have been many difficulties, and my efforts must be aimed at the police cherishing the local community and enabling the people to live and work in peace. I am very grateful for today's reception by your committee and for being able to gather together with colleagues from the First Police Bureau."</p>
<h3 id="e30">Statement by Shigeru Gojima <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Chief of the Economic Security Division, Shigeru Gojima, stated, in summary: "In general, the police in this city have close contact with the people in form, but in reality, their feelings are often separated. This phenomenon should be reformed. Therefore, after the establishment of our division, the task of inspecting materials must be carried out by the economic police of our division. No other police are allowed to participate in the inspection. This is the established policy of our division. Before the establishment of our division, many people thought there was profit to be made and asked to work for us. Later, because there was no profit to be made, they left one after another. I am strict in my work, and I am afraid that the scope is broad and there are inevitable shortcomings. I hope everyone will cooperate. The working policy of our division is to focus on the big picture, focusing on the distant and the important. We do not engage in trivial pursuits for general business people, but we will never tolerate treacherous merchants, profiteers, and speculators in order to eliminate the toxic currents of Shanghai society. Finally, please provide instructions at any time on what should be promoted and what should be reformed in our division."</p>
<h3 id="e31">### Household Sugar Rations to Be Universally Sold Starting Tomorrow, Increased to Ten Ounces Per Person <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The household sugar rations that the city's residents have been eagerly awaiting will be sold starting tomorrow (the 21st) after being approved by the Economic and Commercial Cooperative. In light of the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival, when residents will need more sugar, this period's sugar rations have been increased to ten ounces per person. Residents in the First District can purchase sugar at designated sugar stores with their thirteenth-period sugar purchase certificates, while residents in the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong districts can purchase sugar with their fourteenth-period sugar purchase certificates. The valid period for this period's sugar purchase certificates is said to be until the 30th of this month, and the price will also be slightly adjusted.</p>
<h3 id="e32">### Cotton Cloth Merchants Engage in Malpractice, Hoping for Immediate Reports <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary cotton cloth allocation in this city, the Commerce and Trade Association formulated the methods and designated retail stores. It also sent a letter to the municipal government to instruct the Economic Bureau to distribute cloth purchase certificates on its behalf. After receiving the order, the Municipal Economic Bureau obtained the cloth purchase certificates from the Commerce and Trade Association according to the actual number of households reported by each district office and forwarded them to the district offices for distribution to residents. Residents can purchase allocated cotton cloth at designated retail stores for the price of one and a half yards per person. All cloth patterns are publicly displayed in the store windows for people to choose from. All residents of this city, except for those who have recently moved in or were just born, can receive one cloth purchase certificate, which means that everyone can purchase one and a half yards of allocated cotton cloth. However, recently, the retail merchants have not been fully complying with the methods stipulated by the Commerce and Trade Association. The variety of patterns displayed is not plentiful, and the sizes are insufficient. If one requests to exchange the cloth, the merchants often make excuses that there is no stock, and even add abusive words. This violates the original intention of the government's cotton cloth allocation policy. The Municipal Economic Bureau is said to be very concerned about this and hates these cunning merchants. In addition to secretly sending personnel to investigate in various places and sending a letter to the Commerce and Trade Association to strictly order the retail merchants to make immediate corrections, it also hopes that the residents will cooperate closely. If the purchased cotton cloth is of insufficient size or is damaged, they should report it to the Municipal Economic Bureau, the Economic Security Division of the First Police Bureau, the Second Police Bureau, or the Commerce and Trade Association at any time so that they can be punished according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e33">### Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank to Move to New Address <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank at 15 The Bund has experienced exceptional business growth in recent years. As the original location is insufficient for office space, the bank has specially renovated the building formerly built by the Bank of China at 23 The Bund for several months. The interior layout is brand new, and the renovation is now complete. The bank plans to move in and begin operations on July 1. It is said that the new location has been scheduled, and all departments of the bank, including the Investigation Department, the Issuing Bureau, the Foreign Exchange Bureau, and the Financial Inspection Department, will move in in stages.</p>

<p>On February 10th and March 8th of this year, the First Police Bureau arrested eighteen gold speculators, including Tang Shiqing and Chen Zhonghan, for violating Article 2 of the "Law on Hoarding Essential Commodities." The case was previously heard by the criminal court of the district court, but due to the serious nature of the case, the hearing could not be concluded by noon. Therefore, the hearing was rescheduled. It has now been learned that the district court has scheduled the retrial to continue on the morning of the 23rd.</p>

<p>The business settlements that banks and financial institutions in the city routinely handle are scheduled for the end of June and the end of December each year. The semi-annual settlement for the end of June this year began last week, and all departments are extremely busy. All banks and financial institutions will complete the interest payments on deposits in the savings and current accounts today (the 20th). All customer deposit interest will be calculated up to the 20th of this month. Interest from the 21st to the 30th will be carried over to the second half of the year. By the end of this month, all banks and financial institutions will have completed their semi-annual business settlements. The 1st and 2nd of July will be regular holidays for banks and financial institutions after the settlements, and business will resume as usual on the 3rd. It is said that during this settlement period, all new loans from banks and financial institutions will be temporarily suspended, and old loans will be actively recovered, so the financial situation in the city has been unusually tight recently.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor: In the "Nanshi Health Authorities Inspect Epidemic Prevention Certificates" item in your local news section on the 19th of this month, after the phrase "It has also been learned," it states that epidemic prevention certificates issued by the Central China Epidemic Prevention Association are considered standard, and that those who have been vaccinated by private physicians must exchange their certificates at the Health Department. This is slightly inconsistent with the facts. The current epidemic prevention certificates are issued by the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee, not the Central China Epidemic Prevention Association. The Health Department of the First District Office has already stopped exchanging certificates for those who have been vaccinated by private physicians. If registered practicing physicians wish to obtain epidemic prevention certificates, they must apply to the Fourth Division of the Municipal Health Bureau, which can issue 50 certificates free of charge each time. To avoid misunderstandings among the public, please publish this letter of correction. - Epidemic Prevention Section, Health Department, First District Office, Shanghai Special Municipality</p>

<p>The Shanghai South Fire Service United Association is organizing a charity football match to raise funds for the fire service renovation. China United will play against the Portuguese League, starting at 5:30 PM today at the Racecourse. The referee will be Deng Xiaoliang, and the linesmen will be Chen Jixiang and He Chunhui. The officials of the organizing committee have already appointed Yao Zhenyuan as the secretary, Yu Cuo as the general manager, and Zhang Le as the manager. Mr. Wen Lanting has been invited to kick off the match, Mr. Wu Songgao will present the awards, and movie stars Han Langen, Guan Hongda, and Yin Xiucen will host the charity auction of footballs. Tickets are available in three categories: grandstand tickets for 200 yuan, infield tickets for 2,000 yuan, and infield tickets for 5,000 yuan. The China United team has selected six players from Donghua and five players from Lianyi, supplemented by the Yu brothers from the First Police Team, forming a powerful team. The team configuration is considered appropriate. Liu Xianhan will be the goalkeeper, and Li Mi and Li Yichen will be the defenders, providing a balance of firmness and flexibility. The midfield line will consist of Tan, Song, and Zhang, which is also considered ideal. The forward line will be led by A. Dai, with Xu Wenkui and Han Longhai assisting on the left and right. The wings will be occupied by Li 㙓 and Gao Baozheng. The Portuguese League team has a stronger defense than offense. Therefore, the defense is tight, and Oliveira, V. Sousa, and Fu En are the core of the team's offense and defense. Other players such as Vikse, Xu Erz, and A. Rochalio are all brave warriors. When the two teams meet, China United has a higher chance of winning, but the Portuguese League is by no means an ordinary team and will do its best. There will be many exciting moments. Spectators are advised to exit through the Huangpi Road gate.</p>
<p>China United: Liu Xianhan, Li Ning, Li Yichen, Song Lingsheng, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Xu Wenkui, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Gao Baozheng. (Reserves) Li Tiansheng, Zheng Yingquan, Yu Lihua, Yu Liming.</p>

<h3 id="e46">National Forum - Suggestions for the Rice Control Committee <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>- Yu Nong</p>
<p>The price of rice in this city has reached tens of thousands of yuan per stone, an unprecedented price that has caused widespread anxiety and a sense of impending doom. The reasons for this situation are none other than the failure to distribute household rice on schedule, its irregular and unpredictable nature, and the lack of explanation to reassure the public. Furthermore, there is no effective solution to remedy the situation, leading the general public to believe that the rationing system is gradually disappearing, resulting in a rush to purchase rice on the black market for relief. This is one factor. In addition, the government's announcement of the temporary procurement outline for rice in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, and the provision in Article 5 that rice entering the city without a transport permit will be treated as private rice, have led many to believe that farmers will no longer be able to freely transport even a few pecks of rice for sale, which would have provided a source of relief. This will also create a major problem for the black market rice that the city relies on for relief, leading to an even more desperate search for supplies. The farmers are also confused about the so-called application for transport permits and fear that any mistake will result in confiscation and fines. Farmers are already like birds startled by a bow, so how dare they try? They remain hesitant, resulting in even scarcer supplies. This is another factor.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Rice Control Committee should address the problem by prescribing the right medicine. First, it should encourage the transportation of rice by purchasing merchants to increase the supply, while making reasonable small-scale purchases of military police rice and household rice to ensure that household rice can be distributed on schedule (with prices set separately, of course) to reassure the public. Third, the free transportation of rice by farmers should not only be increased in quantity to at least one stone, but also simplified in terms of procedures to allow for complete freedom. Any procedure that directly or indirectly hinders the free transportation of rice by farmers should be abolished to increase the supply. I have read the Rice Control Committee's announcement on the procedures for applying for permits to transport rice into Shanghai, which is divided into three categories, A, B, and C. Category C is specifically designed for farmers transporting less than five pecks of rice, and is limited to one day of validity and expires the next day. I believe this requires discussion.</p>
<p>Since the first principle is to encourage farmers to freely transport rice, the limited quantity is too small. Why is it necessary to have a certificate? What does the certificate prove? If the purpose is to prove the origin, it is impossible to prove it at the entrance. If the purpose is to collect statistics, it is sufficient to have someone register at the entrance. Once the rice has entered, it should be allowed to be bought and sold freely, and there is no need for proof. Furthermore, since various permits are stipulated not to incur any fees, this expense should be saved at a time when paper is expensive and printing materials are scarce. Second, most farmers transport rice into the city by carrying it on their shoulders or backs and walking. They are not only selling their rice but also selling their labor and time. The entrance will inevitably be crowded, and if everyone must be asked and fill out a statement, what will be the delay in procedures and the waste of time? I firmly believe that there will not only be chaotic scenes of people rushing to be first, but also opportunities for corruption and abuse of power. The result will not only cause great suffering to the farmers but also double the cost of their rice transportation, which is not the way to encourage farmers or suppress rice prices. Third, most farmers are illiterate and have unclear speech, so it is easy for mistakes to occur in the rice they carry and the certificates they fill out. Moreover, farmers carrying heavy loads and sweating are more likely to lose or damage these certificates. What will be the farmers' suffering when they encounter strict inspections and difficulties from the police at every five steps and the guards at every ten steps in the city? The abuses are unspeakable. Fourth, since there is a certificate for rice moving within the city, all moving rice will have a certificate. How will household rice be moved, and how will the rice subsidies distributed by factories and organizations to their employees be moved? Furthermore, if the certificate is implemented, the police along the way will be most diligent in performing these duties, and every bag of rice will be checked. In the future, all kinds of evils will be carried out in the name of checking certificates.</p>
<p>Therefore, based on the above four points, the issuance of certificates seems to be more harmful than beneficial and should be avoided. As for the Rice Control Committee's provision that "the storage of rice for consumption is limited to three months, and exceeding the limit will be considered as hoarding and will be punished," the original intention of this legislation is to prevent hoarding, speculation, and profiteering, which is not to be criticized. However, we believe that there is a big difference between reasonable "accumulation" and illegal "hoarding," and they should not be treated the same. "Store grain to prevent famine" is an ancient saying (each place has grain storage facilities based on this idea). Therefore, it seems clear that storing more rice for consumption by one's family should not be considered hoarding. For example, a family of eight may be able to store rice for six months or a year (but in fact, rice cannot be stored for more than half a year unless it is stored in a special facility). In fact, those who have prepared for themselves are not as easily panicked as those who have not, as is the case now. It is those who have not been able to obtain household rice and have not made preparations who have largely contributed to the current high rice prices of tens of thousands of yuan. Those who have already prepared are not involved. Otherwise, with everyone rushing to buy, the price of rice could easily reach 50,000 yuan. The facts are clear. Therefore, the authorities should not only not ban storage but also encourage grain accumulation to reduce the severity of unforeseen circumstances (such as sudden problems with transportation, etc.) and even, in desperation, borrow grain from those who have stored generously to provide some relief. Saving the desperate is an ancient saying, and it is likely that a temporary request will be possible. Therefore, if the purpose and behavior of storing grain are indeed for self-use to prevent famine and not for hoarding, speculation, or profiteering, it is a reasonable "tax" and should not be considered a crime even if the storage exceeds three months. However, if the purpose and behavior are indeed for hoarding, speculation, or profiteering, it is illegal "hoarding," and the amount hoarded, even if it is less than three months' worth, should be punished as hoarding to comply with the law. Furthermore, once the storage of grain is limited to three months and exceeding the limit is illegal, every household will have to be thoroughly inspected, and every peck of rice in and out will be a matter of imprisonment. The number of people in the household, their ages, whether they are young or old, the amount of grain they eat, and whether they have relatives or friends visiting will all become major problems. Homes will become fraught with troubles, and the abuses that will result are unimaginable. Policymakers must be cautious from the beginning. Furthermore, the authorities have suddenly ordered that grain storage is limited to three months without a probationary period. What will happen to those who currently have more than three months' worth of grain? If they continue to store the excess grain, they will be guilty of exceeding the limit. If they sell it immediately, they will be guilty of speculation and profiteering. They will be guilty whether they advance or retreat, and it is not clear how they will be handled. In summary, it seems that the restriction on storage is more harmful than beneficial and should be avoided. Furthermore, the fact that rice in both cities cannot be stored for long and cannot be stored in excessive quantities has already become a natural restriction, so there is no need to have a law to regulate it, which may only lead to abuses.</p>

<p>— Iwata Toyoo Barracks, Sayang Discussion</p>
<p>"Ah, it's finished!"</p>
<p>The calligrapher Ichiki, who was talking with Tsuruhara at a small table in the drawing room, said this with a smile when Takao removed the cloth covering the painting.</p>
<p>Takao had originally intended to wait until Atsushi returned before showing the painting to Ichiki, but because the moving company delivered it unexpectedly early, he had no choice but to open it in front of Tsuruhara.</p>
<p>"There's a number 50 frame in that place. Put it in there and let me see it on the bookshelf!"</p>
<p>Takao did as his teacher said. Then he looked at his own books again, perhaps because of the calm light of Atsushi and the drawing room, which he always felt was more elegant than at his own home.</p>
<p>"Sure enough, it has finally become the warship I longed for. The waves and fog are very well researched."</p>
<p>The calligrapher did not seem very interested in warships, but always pointed out the advantages of many seascapes in detail. Takao was half happy and half hesitant.</p>
<p>"In short, this book on warships is very rare. Mr. Tsuruhara, what is your critique?"</p>
<p>Ichiki smiled and looked at his friend who was smoking.</p>
<p>"You are right, it is a very rare book. This is only to say that you can't find it at any exhibition, it is a very rare painting."</p>
<p>Tsuruhara's argument was a bit sarcastic.</p>
<p>"What you said is certainly right, but what's wrong with it? What do you think?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is using something that should not be used as a subject as a subject for writing."</p>
<p>"No, what I have set is the emotion contained in the writing. But can't warships become material for expression?"</p>
<p>Ichiki tilted his head. (103)</p>
