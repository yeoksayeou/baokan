<p>社評</p>
<h3>切莫偷懶</h3>
<p>今年定大東亞戰爭的決戰年。好比接力賽跑，這是最後一站，跑這一站的人要振起精神，咬緊牙關，勇往直前，一步不能停留，奔向終點。這是勝敗關頭，也是生死關頭，最重要，也最緊張，這就是決戰年的意義</p>
<p>尙書說：「為山九仭，功虧一簣」。孔子說：「　如為山，未成一簣，止，吾止也：響如平地，雖覆一簣，進，吾往也」。朱熹注釋：「中道而止，則前功盡棄，其止其往，皆在吾而不在人也」。這都是敎人家在緊要關頭，不能半途而廢，要自彊不息，發奮為雄，否則便赴前功盡棄。成敗得失，繫」於一念，繫於「吾」之一身。自已不努力，決不能希望人家來代養努力。自己不努力，決不能希望僥倖成功。只有把「吾」的血汗，才可換得「吾」的成功，，此外，就沒有第二條路。</p>
<p>處在大時代的人們，看了眼前的局勢知道大東亞戰爭二年來的成績，已經在困苦艱難之中，奠定了必勝的基石，十分之八九的工作已經做完了，還剩下十分之一二的工作需要我們繼續去做，可是這十分之一二的工作，更需我們加倍的努力，加倍的吃苦，加倍的奮鬥。我們不願意「功虧一簣」，我們不願「前功盡棄」，那末大家起來，負起一切的責任，向前進行。這時候，一切的切，皆在吾而不在人，把自己的努力決定自已的命運。於此，我們願意貢獻給國人的，但望全國上下，振作起來。</p>
<p>政府應當振作起來，時時反省，到底替國家做了多少事，替人民謀了多少福利。假如沒有做，或者做得不多，那末，從今以後應當立刻做，應當立刻多做。假如沒有能力去做，沒有能力去多做，那末，從今起應當起用全國八才，一起趕快去做。旣不能進，又不能退，最足貽害國家，平時或許尙可等待，非常時期的最後五分鐘那裏可以躭誤。</p>
<p>國民應當振作起來，時時反省，在各個人的本位上，已經替國家做了多少事。特別是從事生產事業者，到底增加了多少生產，貢獻了多少力量。切不可推詞說環境的困難，因為這是任何國家在戰爭時期普遍的現象，而別的國家愈在戰時，愈顯出國民的力量，可見環境決不能妨礙一個人的進行，只有不能進取的人，方才受環境的支配·此外，個人的財富是與國家的財富相聯系的，有國家整個的財富，方能保全個人的財富，否則，「皮之不存，毛將焉附」。所以看重國家利益，就是看重個人利益，把這個念頭時時記在心上，時時振作，替國家多多努力，然後，國家民族方可復興，國民安樂，方能承享。</p>
<h3>日機冒惡劣天氣夜襲希爾基亞市　敵軍事設施數處被炸重創</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　據緬甸某基地電，緬甸方面日陸軍機轟炸隊，於三日夜半冒惡劣天氣，强襲印度東部之希爾基亞，使敵軍防衛伊姆法爾之後方據點因之震撼。另一部日機於空襲希爾基亞北方飛行塲後，更向置有標識之敵軍陣地投彈。炸毀其設施兩處。同時，另一隊日機則排除敵戰開機三架之警戒陣，飛抵希爾基亞，於炸毀市內軍事設施後，安然返防。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據加爾各答電，阿薩密省政府六日發表公報稱：日軍三日夜轟炸希爾基亞及伊姆法爾兩地。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據加爾各答來電，印度阿薩密省政府六日布吿稱：反軸心軍現正與日本軍在馬尼布爾戰綫交戰，故日本飛機之轟炸阿薩密州，將較從前加緊，預想將有多人負傷，於此種塲合，須對負傷者輸血，故為貯藏血淸起見，希一般民衆提供各自之血液。</p>
<h3>緬境敵空挺隊　呈饑饉狀態　日機爭襲加拉特機塲</h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　伊洛瓦底河上游之敵空挺部隊，自總帥聞蓋特死亡後，已呈動搖之現象，故敵東南亞洲司令官蒙特巴頓最近曾激勵彼等稱：「聞蓋特之死，與大局無關，今後期待於諸君者仍多」。但食糧子彈等僅仰伏飛機補給，自屬因難萬分，故其軍隊之主部已瀕於飢饉狀態。蒙特巴頓僅紙上空言而已，彼等到處遭日軍有力部隊之猛攻，多四散潰走。</p>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　緬甸方面之日本陸軍機隊，自二十八日之政擊以來，曾暫守沉默，監覦敵空挺隊之蠢動，本月三日起，再度猛攻敵軍空挺部隊，其譯情如次：三日薄暮，日軍戰鬥機隊突急襲納密（加薩西北五十公里）西北十五公里之加拉特敵機塲，敵方之對空砲火異當猛烈，日機以機槍砲對之攻擊，而擊毀其陶格未明，日急降下轟炸機隊，强襲加拉特敵機塲，於超低空加以準確之轟炸，於擊毀該機塲設施後，全　安返基地。</p>
<h3>自由印度實施新幣制　日經濟界之見解</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　此聞經濟評論界得悉自由印度臨時政府設立銀行實施貨幣制度之消息後，均為臨時政府及印人祝福並表示見解稱：印度臨時政府此次實施獨自之貨幣制度，新銀行亦已於五日開業，此印度曩受英國强制採用銀本位制度，俾可盡量榨取印度之黃金運往倫敦，此為英國掠奪黃金之妙計。英國於一九二七年四月一日不顧印人之極力反對，而在印境施行金本位制度，致印人復受該制度之極度壓迫，今印度已經獨立，並恢復彼等自身之貨幣之權，此舉實可</p>
<h3>英美首腦失和</h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　美國首腦部，自去年高呼之緬甸總反攻迭遭敗北後，頃已不顧美軍首腦部之積極進攻，而對錢緬戰綫之敗戰大放其悲觀論調，冀圖將敗戰責任轉嫁於人。據最近在緬甸北部捕之敵空軍俘虜稱：蒙特巴頓一月中旬為視察空挻隊之滑空訓練，於赴比哈州加雅附近之拉拉多浦爾時，對英·美將兵曾作如下之訓辭：「對德作戰未終了前，恐不能積極進攻緬甸」，緬甸總反攻之宣傳，受日方猛攻之成脅後，已暴露敵首腦部之失和。</p>
<h3>日駐泰大使　訪畢本首相</h3>
<p>盤谷七日中央社電　日駐泰大使坪上，六日下午五時偕同石井參事官至泰苜相官邸，訪問日本首相，患談多時始辭出。</p>
<h3>緬甸人民組織阿拉坎義勇軍</h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　印度國民軍在阿拉坎地區奮戰，需緬甸居民協力之處頗多。故印緬人已携手崛起，共同保術東亞，綠有大批緬人為呼應印度國民軍作戰，自動執槍揮劍，參加戰門，名日「阿拉坎養勇軍」，彼等向以密林為家，尤善於游擊戰。「阿拉坎養勇軍」，係去年一月左右由阿拉坎辛哈所組織者英空軍不實現華維爾奪回緬甸之夢想，以日溪為中心，實行游擊戰，英印軍竟侵彼等之家鄕，辛哈為防衛家鄕，乃召集靑年若干人，組織義勇軍，並任選克拉溫為指揮官，於是聲勢日趨浩大，協力日軍，或充密探潛入敵陣，探察敵情，或擊滅敵軍，樹立殊勳。敵軍亦深知義勇軍之活動，為其致命傷，並謂「前次阿拉坎悲劇發生之原因，乃為吾人虐待緬人所致」，於雨季敵軍反攻時，曾組織謀略部隊，以前日溪地區林務官巴森特少將為隊長，懷柔國境之緬人，並開始破壞義勇軍工作，但均未奏效。緬甸靑年加入義勇軍者，與日俱增，聞三月中旬有緬甸少年名賈丹者年僅十五，在乃母之激勵下，腰掛緬甸刀，踴躍加入義勇軍，開往前綫作戰，全軍士氣為之大振。本年二月底，有敵軍約五千之衆，沿加拉頓河南下，日軍及義勇置當即邀擊，切斷其退路，敵軍大亂，乃向河岸之密林地帶漢走，當地居民亦在義勇軍之指揮下，削竹為槍，跟踪追擎。喀克特南部村鎭中，緬人全部出動追擊敵軍，在加克耶夫逮捕英人將校及英軍十餘人。又三月十二日自衛團團員蒙哈，曾單身殺死敵軍數人，生擒一人，當地居民之活動情形，實堪注目，敵軍鑒於前次之失敗，高呼此次不可再虐待緬人，然其掠奪行為，實增加居民之僧恨，故國境一帶居民，在義勇軍領導下，無不充滿打倒英國之鬥志。</p>
<h3>南太平洋美海軍　司令將易人</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據康白拉訊：尼米資上將部下之美駐南太平洋海軍司令韓爾賽，行將免聯，據悉美西南太平洋總司令麥克沃塞則不受此次調動影響。</p>
<h3>中青幹校舉辦　作戰演習班</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　中央靑年幹部學校，以戰時國防訓練之重要，特繼續舉辦第十一期普通訓練班（作戰演習班）。該班係調各校模　國團員受訓，由四月十日起至二十二日止，訓期為兩星期。</p>
<p>南京七日中央社電　中央靑少年幹部學校，今春以來，開辦國防訓練班，先後訓練完畢者，計有救護·防空·防毒·通訊等三班。尙有作戰演習班，及劍道班，均即將開始訓練。所有上述各班，預定本年五月五日靑年節舉行公開表演。該校特於七日在該校會議室舉行敎務會議，召集各處處長曁總隊長會商進行辦法。敎育長林柏生親臨主持，議決要案多項，四時散會。</p>
<h3>日機空襲　南寗飛機塲</h3>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　日航空部隊，於六日黎明，强製南寗飛機塲。炸毀地下（B25）型機二架，（P40）型機三架，又迎擊敵戰門機隊，擊落其七架，猛烈轟炸地上軍事處設日役日據亦表失二架</p>

<h3>從確保治安安定民生說到地方政制革新</h3>
<p>— 丁默邨</p>
<p>四月五日申報社評，論「革新地方政制」。同時，發表新民君的「地方行政制度革新芻見」一文，對於地方行政制度的重耍性，頗多申論，對於地方行政制度的革新步驟，頗多建議。對此問題，本人亦深感興趣，敢申所見，以供各方之探討。</p>
<p>現在一般人都希望抑平物價，安定民生。當然，安定民生是國府政策中最重要的部份；抑平物價，是安定民生中最初步的手段。可是，抑平物價，似不簡單，最主要者在於增加生產，使物資充分供給；疏通來源，使物資交流圓滑。勉强的抑壓與限價，是標是末。這些道理，已為時下談論物價問題者共同瞭解了。</p>
<p>然而，如欲達到增加生產與物資交流圓滑的目的，還有一個很重要的前提，就是確保治安。如果治安不能確保，則增加生產，在過程中可能發生意外的打攪，影響預期成效。在生產後可能發生意外的機失。譬如農業生產，因為治安不良，農民作息無常，減低收成。即令收成不減，而收穫的農產，落在　人之手，或被匪人封鎖，無法輸出農村，亦屬白費氣力。又如工業工產，因為治安不良，工作時時停頓，減少產量，結果不但不能增產，反致　縮。再如治安不能確保，則物資輸運，無論為舟為車，隨時遭受阻塞，無法圓滑交流。所以，確保治安，直接是保護增加生不，保護物資輸運，間接就是協助抑平物價，南昌安定民生。</p>
<p>次言確保治安，其基本辦法，不外淸鄕與剿共。剿共固然就是淸鄕工作之一部份，可是，在目前共匪猖狂，剿共尤為淸鄉工作中最迫切的工作。復次，淸鄉與剿共，旣是確保治安的基本辦法，應由國府各部門共同努力，視為目前工作之重心，絕不是某一個機關可以單獨擔負，也不是某一部分人可以獨力擔負。應該機關與機關，政府與人民，整個聯合，整個動員。</p>
<p>怎樣整個動員呢？可以分立體與平而兩方面：立體動員，是中央·省巿·縣區·農村一貫執行。平面動員，是軍事·政治·經濟·文化同時推進。這樣縱的一貫執行，橫的同時並進，才能收整個動員，確保治安之實效。</p>
<p>單憑軍事實施淸鄕，實施剿共，雖能奏效一時，但軍事時期過去以後，潛伏匪徒，又死灰復燃。尤其共產黨與新四軍匪徒，完全潛伏在農村鄉錢之問，國軍進剿，則逃逸無蹤，國軍調防，則出而猖狂。因過去進剿，偏重軍事，與政治經濟文化各方而之配合，殊欠緊密，政府與人民之合作，亦欠　緊，換言之，乃立體動員，平面動員，未臻完善，致木能絕其根源，致使死灰易於復燃。</p>
<p>有人謂中央是點（全國之重點），省巿是綫，縣與農村是面，治安至今日未能完全確立，亦可調各方面以前過份忽視「面」的原故，因太忽視「面」，致匪共乃日益猖狂也。</p>
<p>進一步言之，各方過去對「面」的問題，不僅過份忽視，甚至有加速加深其惡化之趨勢，此固非有意為之，但即使出於不知不覺，其於「面」之有害，則無可逃避。如貪汚之縣長或腐惡之區長，常有人被其利用，代為庇護，似此「面」之問題，安得不日趨嚴重？</p>
<p>就整個政制言，中央領導省，省領導縣，但政令政策之推行，治安之確保，民生之安定，仍在縣之一層。還都以後談革新政治之士，似禾開有及於縣者，個人常大惑不解，以前自慰或係個人之偏見，然就今日匪共猖狂情形觀之，個人所見，似非毫無根據。目前治安與民生二者，可議之點，固亦不少，然僅責難中央，成責難少數中央領導人，基於上列理由，敢謂並非特平之論。良以中央方面，無時不思勵精圖治，但以地方制度不健全，地方人事未符理想，致中央亦力不從心也。</p>
<p>總之，强化國府，增進其力量，俾得盡其對大東亞之責任，此為各方共同之鴿的。如何强化國府並增進其力量，則確保治安，安定民生為基本條件，而確保治安與安定民生，復有互相推進互為因果之作用。欲確保治安安定民生，（包括淸鄕剿共，）以立體言，必須中央·省市·縣區·農村整個動員；以平面言，必須政治·經濟·文化·軍事整個配合一切工作基礎在「面」。所收成果亦在「面」，故今後對「面」的問題，應切實改進。</p>
<p>至於「面」之改進，必須地方制度與地方人事，同時革新，唯有好的制度，方可吸引眞正廉潔幹練人才，亦唯有眞正廉潔幹練人才，方能運用好的制度。以目前之地方制度，即令眞正幹練廉潔人才，亦無從質其所長，展其抱負，徒屬自討苦吃而已。</p>
<p>四月五日申報社評及所載地方制度革新　兌，本人極表贊同，尙盼各方，多加留意。</p>

<p>中央社訊　關於渝方實施憲政，以五年爲中心之問題，頃據本市方面所透露消息，謂渝上次派這訪英團員杭立武，于最近返渝時，就個人對渝憲政，特予發表談話。其內容謂：　關於實施憲政日期迫近，深望渝府早日成立各級民意機構，俾使人民有參政機會。並盼各地人民推派代表，克盡厥責，採用主權，勿將民意機構成爲私人權益工具。　採用法律主治，蓋法律高于一切，涵意有二，其一爲決不容武斷權力之存在，人民在非經法律之前，不受處罰。其二爲政府官吏，不論私人名義及公務員資格，如有違法越　行爲，一律依照平民同受法律之制裁。其二爲人民有基本自由，且有選舉權，幷可准許自由選舉人事，得組織政府，又得以和平手叚，主張變更反對政府。人民更應自由批評政府，及提出討論政治。又可反對政府非法逮捕濫禁，可藉言論上之機會，要求身體自由，此爲懲政上人民必耍之基本自由，否則民治憲政不得存在。查中國五五憲草對該三項人民基本自由，巳有明白之規定。即在訓政時期，亦已有民法規定。値茲戰時期內，國家對人民之自由，不能不予相當限制，爲求實現憲政逐漸上進之際，深望政府在可能範圍中，寬放言論機會之限制。並提前實行保障人民身體自由，此外更希望人民有守法精神，以逐漸增進首由，則人民之自由權，不致有可濫用。總之，憲政之實施，乃求雙方並進，除希望政府開放政權外，並盼人民各盡其實。故關於渝人民要求開放黨禁，及實施地方祖織，地方自治之空氣，渝方全境，騷擾不堪。因此渝蔣竟無法對付此項要求。去年渝召開四中全會，所　決之實行憲政提議，已瀕困難地位，不啻作繭自縛。而英美方面對渝頗爲疑惑，曾嚴重討論，究趨向民主國家之途，抑或民治之途。因此目前渝方對內對外之應付，殊為焦慮。</p>

<h3>渝蒙糾紛嚴重　槍擊哥薩克人　外蒙發表嚴重聲明</h3>
<p>中央社訊　遽本市方面可靠消息，關於渝方與外蒙發生摩擦糾粉，頗爲嚴重。查新疆省內蘇聯勢力，頗爲澎賬，而渝方爲謀阻遏起見，曾作種種對付方針。首由渝方嗾使新疆省政府主席盛世才，驅逐蘇聯勢力出境。一方面在新加强渝方勢力，特成立省黨部，期以國民黨勢力，明爲建設省府基礎，暗則實行監視，故在新疆省內滿佈不安現象。此外如渝軍在新越境外蒙，又爲外蒙所嚴重注視。本月四日，外蒙庫倫人民共和國政府，特發表談話，其內容謂去年十二月時，有哥爲克民族人民，在新北部游牧，新省府下令追逐，後經外蒙在西南部山峽帶調查結果，逐民已向北方移東。爲遵照國際這義精神，及蒙古憲法，在所管轄國境，沿途設立收容難民，並給予領土內之生活權。詎新省仍予追擊開槍亂射，致外蒙人民所住村落，被射彈頗多。嗣後外蒙軍隊乃加以有效還擊，相互對峙。至本年三月二十日，始將新渝軍擊退。並謂外蒙爲加强防範，兩方國境決將取必要措置應付云。</p>
<h3>郭培爾著文　論德國潛力　决努力奮鬥文成使命</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊：「德國週報」刊戰宣傳部長郭培爾最近論文，內稱，德國之地理情勢及一般生活，均迫使德人較之他國更加努力，以求國家生存。德人經長時間之奮鬥，始具此卓越之精力與效率，此次戰學之進展，證明此項論點之確實性。吾人與世界四大强國作戰已歷五年，仍能保持今日之地位，吾人完全以自己之力量，與若干明敵及暗仇周旋。敵人估計吾人力量，屢次失之過低，乃囿於成見，無法擺脫之，故東綫作戰，德人僅以一倍數之人力，與兩倍之敵周旋，同時在義大利境內，少數德軍與英美兩大强國優越之人力物力相對峙，使敵不能如願以償。試間以敵之優勢移作我用，又或敵軍須各方面應戰亦如吾人，其結果又將如何。現代德人爲完成其使命，所歷艱辛，幾越人類之忍耐力，至於空襲財產損失，吾人對遭遇犧牲之德人，謹表敬意，如有避免犧牲之可能，吾人當盡力爲之，總之，吾人正面對一新時代。</p>

<p>羅洪軍協力戰局趨穩定</p>
<p>柏林林七日中央社電　海通社訊：德生力軍及羅軍在普魯斯河一帶與敵作戰，而洪牙利軍則在喀爾巴阡山前奮戰，陣綫已大爲穩定。蒂里古爾河聶斯特河下游及普魯斯河間之德軍，一面抵抗一面撤退，將所有戰具　重均安全運出。奧迪薩之德後衛軍，正憑雙重要塞工事而抵抗，敵於週三仍朱能突破此項工事以抵轟斯特河下游，此項進攻之未見成功，已影響中路自巴爾蒂向基希納夫推進之敵軍。敵沿蒂拉斯波爾雅賽鐵路進襲未果，羅軍正力抗蘇軍在雅賽以北渡過普魯斯河。德軍於週三自史卡拉卡孟納茲巴杜爾斯克越森斯特河向塞爾諾蒂而西撒，避免敵軍之包圍。勃羅第與柯維爾有猛烈之爭奪戰，柯維爾之德軍突圍向西北而進，與自北及西北方面前來援救之德軍相遇，柯維爾現在德軍主要戰綫以內。北路庇普斯湖南之敵軍攻勢，現已伸展至奧斯特洛夫區，大約敵軍在南路進攻被阻，有在北路蠢動之意。</p>

<h3>歐洲戰局的新趨勢</h3>
<p>第二戰線問題　　邱吉爾在二月二十二日的議會演說中稱：現在英美對德國的空襲，乃爲不來的侵歐戰之基礎。對此，據德國當局的見解，敵人或許企圖侵入大陸的某地，或同時在數處侵入。但德國有充分的自信，無論在何處有敵人登陸，隨時可加以擊潰。去年末敵方任命艾森霍華爲總司令，整頓陣綫，着手大陸侵攻作戰，德方亦以羅美爾元帥爲總司令，親自視察大西洋沿岸，更加强堅如鐵壁的大西洋防綫。</p>
<p>最近郭培爾宣傳部畏在大德意志報上斷定「英美所計劃的西歐侵攻時期漸次迫近。」粽合德國有力的新聞記者或中立國方面的觀測，侵入西歐當在不久。如此次的邱吉爾演說中所稱，自本年春至夏，大襲將更見激化，所以空陸侵入的基礎，非在豆季不能完成。</p>
<p>總之，英美的方法，乃將損失止於最小限度。如果能夠這樣就放心了。邱吉爾的打算，乃欲先擊潰德國空軍，尤其是戰鬥機，完全握住了制空種以後，始悠然實施登陸。是以關於第二戰綫開闢的時期，能夠大胆預言的話，大約當在夏季。</p>
<p>其次，關於侵入作戰塲所的問題，亦莫衷一是。一般的說法，其主力部隊或許從英法海峽奎南　的大西洋沿岸登陸。有推測丹麥海岸說者，但專門家則視爲距離過遠，頗爲困難，戰鬥機的援護亦略嫌過遠。亦有挪威說者，但第一這在地形上易守難攻，縱令能夥陸登，要攻到德國本土，亦關隘重重，頗非易事。至於先攻巴爾幹論，在政治上涉及巴爾幹問題，且同時英美又須先承認蘇聯的勢力圈，故其實現性頗少。再從最近英美對西班牙的態度看來，伊比利亞半鳥登睦說亦不能斷定其必無。對此，前面已經說過，敵人無論從何方前來，已有勝算在握，我們毋甯說戰局至此已一變而爲攻擊英國的好機會。</p>
<p>德國報復轟炸</p>
<p>邱吉爾曾說，德國因英美的空襲而不能不將其現有戰鬥機的五分之四集結於西部戰錢。事當上，去秋以來德國兵力的移動，並不是因爲敵人的空炸所及於東部戰綫及義大利戰綫的影響，乃是爲了準備英美的侵攻歐洲。所以現在東部戰綫各地點的撤退，如以爲是因此而起的現象，那就錯了。德國對蘇戰爭的現階段，是所謂躲避作戰，使敵人乗勢傾其預備軍及兵力前來進攻。德方在每地節節抵抗，避免增加自己的損傷，而引誘敵人。另一方面，英美宣傳說德國的飛機生產力因空襲而減低百分之四五，這數字亦不正確。敵人所企圖的不過是邱吉爾所說要殲滅德國戰鬥機而已，事實上也正是如此，有計劃的轟炸德國有飛機工廠關係的都市。問題在於此舉究有多少效果。說到這一點，從以前的宣傳與事實的距離剖析起來，可以知道德國並沒有受到這樣大的打擊。　　就以柏林的近郊而言，雖受到那樣的盲炸，工廠亦未被毀至不可思議的程度。大部份蒙　者是普通的住宅，敎會，醫院等。德國早已妥籌對策，徹底分散工廠，並未如英美方面所宣傳和計　一樣受損。</p>
<p>東戰線近况</p>
<p>最後說到東部戰綫最近的動向，前面已經說過，德國方面在德蘇戰爭中的作戰指導方針乃放棄地域使敵人流血。德國並不是敗逃，兵士的士氣決不銷沈，所以蘇聯自從去年七月起，約八個月來繼續採取攻勢而顯現疲勞時，即轉取攻勢。至少可以說，在那種場合，德方充分有着必要時出以逆製的準備與戰意。至於到什麼時候，或在什麼地方這樣　變當然不能預言。</p>
<p>有人這樣觀測，蘇聯北部在波羅的海國境，中部在舊波蘭國境，南部迫近羅馬尼亞國境，全面的取攻勢前進，故德國或將有何種新舉動加以阻止。現在成爲問題者，蘇　對芬蘭的敵治工作，亦頗堪注意。</p>
<p>臨到這種嚴重局面，這戰爭的本質，即國家存亡的命題，頓化為現實的問題，而不能不作戰到底。這一點，即邱吉爾本身亦率直加以承認。祇要前綫後方有此堅强的決心，祗要有完遂長期戰的準備，蘇聯的攻勢也好，英美的强化空襲也好，乃至第二戰綫也好，決不能使德國屈服。（翔：譯自三月十日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>鹽田大尉駁斥　美報狂妄讕言　分析帕勞島敵失敗原因</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部代表鹽田大尉，昨日下午在睦海外聯合報道常會席上，就敵美在太平洋上失敗之理由，指陳　詳，幷申斥敵美之無稽宣傳。</p>
<p>敵美損失</p>
<p>鹽田氏首對帕勞島亦與雅普島之日軍採用出血作戰時，發表謂：此時敵方所用艦隊，僅十餘艘大型艦，於廿三日企圖向日方陣地侵犯，而敵美諾克斯上校詭稱：運用五十餘艘巨大戰艦，並謂發動尼米資攻勢，準備向南洋菲律濱馬尼拉進發，轉向中國之南方。但是項敵方之作戰竟完全瓦解，歸趨失敗，此時所謂之敵美大艦隊赴帕勞島，不啻爲一教育上之材料而己，敵國內亦難以打破困難，深爲焦慮。鹽田氏特指出敵方失敗原因有二：其一即在帕勞島未克有些微之攻擊，其二謀與日本艦隊作正面作戰，此次敵艦隊被日本艦隊玩弄，結果敵損失戰艦二艘，航空母艦一艘，大型戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，因此敵方在太平洋上之作戰，由於諾古斯之誑言，所謂五十餘艘大艦隊參加作戰，不攻自破。然渠等企圖欺騙美國民衆，更感難於應付。美紐約泰晤士報曾代華府作無聊之辯正，竟謂；　美大型艦隊未遇日海軍，　西南太平洋完全在其控制之下，　南方無數島　，均在其壓制之下云云。</p>
<p>對日有利</p>
<p>鹽明大尉網對此偏面之　言，加以指斥，認爲毫無根據，並加以分析：　紐約奏晤士報之無稽宣傳，謂美利用艦隊進犯，迄未獲得些微　果，蓋日本艦隊如欲與其正面作戰，或非正面作戰，是爲日本之自由，但日海軍對敵美艦隊，僅利用少數航空部隊及海上部隊嚴加以攻擊，重創敵人，此亦爲日艦隊之自由，如美艦隊之補給綫愈長，對日本則更有利，若敵大艦隊所經之處，不就地向日軍進犯，而日電自當乘敵不防，加以攻擊，故未採取向敵艦隊作正面作戰，即在帕勞島敵一時決難企圖進擊。　所謂西南太平洋在彼輩控制之下，絕菲事實，在開戰時，艦隊所到之處，未必即所佔之區，在兵法上亦有此指引，盜制海權並非限於時間的與空間的，斷難立刻佔領，故日本在西南太平洋之制空權決不讓敵侵入，即如敵已獲取西南大平洋制空權，則五十餘艘大艦，猶惑不足應付，此囚該處島類頗多，均爲日本作戰上之要塞與據點，果若此次作戰美立刻獲致西南太平洋制空權，則不必拖延至今猶未實現。</p>
<p>日軍勝利</p>
<p>所謂攻擊壓制南方無數島嶼，查是　島嶼，均爲日本所佔領，單以距離而言，在補給方面則日本距離較美國爲近，是以紐約泰晤士報之無稽爾言，不啻爲美國此次作戰結果之一報告。日艦隊所得之勝利，在茲亦已證明，且防空力强大無比，今即以戰局之進展在時間上觀之，最近日航空機技師增加以及航空人員之增加，是以戰局之進展，爲期不遠。再覘美之補給綫愈長，於日本作戰上，乃爲極好之時機，故在南方日海軍所得之基地，已逐漸成爲要塞堡壘，就目前而觀，敵方雖虛張聲勢，但在不久之目前，日本終必一舉而使之全部殲減，吾人可拭目以待，今次敵方之反攻，所受失敗，猶企圖　蔽國內，但本月四日日大本營所發表之消息，僅一部份而已，故敵所發表之情報，恒利用日本所發表者作爲根據。當茲報道宣傳戰之際，日本亦勝敵一籌，尤其日大本營所發表之報道，全世界人士莫不認爲正確，敵美國民盡人皆知，故美海軍部對於失敗痕跡，亦斷雖　滿。</p>

<p>兒童節特輯　之四</p>
<h3>平江兒童敎養院近况</h3>
<p>平江兒童教養院，創立於民國廿七年的冬天。　初祗規定收養難童五十名，後來逐漸擴充，並自定房屋，决定增加名額至二百名，到現在為止，共有人數為一百七十三人，　　，最大的是十六歲，最小的是八歲，其中以十歲的居多敗。</p>
<p>日常生活</p>
<p>在日常生活方面，因為年齡過幼，所以比較簡樸，早晨是六時半起身，七時吃早　、七時到八時一小時內，是兒童們寫字的時間，九時以後到下午四時，除了中同吃中飯時間外、是上課的時間，從一年級到六年　，踝程依照小學編制，下午四時以後，便編結網袋，或做些雕刻工作，但首入的工資很微薄，這點囚為他們年齡太幼小，不能兼習其他更煩難的手工藝，來增加生產。</p>
<p>據院中負實人談：因為房屋的狹窄，對於現有的人數，已有擁擠之感，這是實在的情形，院內房屋，一共是五開間三層，一樓元禮堂和食堂，二樓是敎室，共四間，敎室裏面的課桌椅陳列尚稱整齊，四　　着學生的作業，書法，作文，圖畫，看上去還不十分　，三樓是　室，一共是三間，床是疊床，先生和兒童們都睡在一起，因為人多的緣故，兒童們是兩人合一張床，每一床的被單一律白色，被頭折成四方形，看去頗覺整齊，一個房間裏有一個保姆，以管理年幼兒童夜間小便或穿着衣服等瑣務。</p>
<p>膳食情形</p>
<p>膳食方面，也是兩粥一飯，早最和晚上是吃粥，中午吃飯，至於煮飯，燒菜，洗碗，抺桌等事務，除了買小菜外完全由兒童們自已動手，當筆者進去參觀時，正是他們午餐時候，許多身體結實的兒童，都在興高采烈的吃着，粥飯和菜，也有規定，粥和飯每人每餐兩碗，菜是「大鍋菜」，兩人合吃一小盆子，菜蔬則不外靑菜。蘿葡。豆腐等。最近由新聞報社會服務處供給，每星期得吃兩次的黃豆和牛肉骨。</p>
<p>經費的來源除了由平江公所補助外，其餘由董事會向外界募集，但平江公所的補助僅及十分之一，所以還是由董事會募集的佔多數，目前該院每月的支出是十萬元，上月份曾超過十一萬，院方的敎養時間是六年，六年以後，他們己有了生活的能力，然後再給他們介紹到各個職業部門中去。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>天空海闊（五）</p>
<p>因為同屋全是年靑力壯的人，所以常常發生臉紅領子組的爭論，然而在這個當兒，默而不　克爾而笑的眞人的態度，就成為奇怪的鎭靜特效藥。他讀着艦內新聞，而揷嘴說：「露着兵曹肚臍的帆布浴池——道一首川柳小調價有趣！」</p>
<p>於是，面紅耳熱的學論，就在笑聲裏吿了一個段落。</p>
<p>艦內新聞是兩面的晚報。能寫文章和能畫圖的士官們，就是發行人兼出版者，是用騰寫版印到八開大小的白紙上，然而編輯的內容，部是相當充實。</p>
<p>主要有「磐手新聞」和日本普通新聞的時別標題，每天都謹錄幾句明治天是的文句，再就是發表國際間的消息，正午的艦位航程，以及第二天的操作日程等。然而副張上就有究全不同的表現，裏面刋載着目的航地指南，或川柳小調中的漫推，甚至有時候發見拜偷的詩句，和近代化的康德的明言。投稿者固然以士官居多數，然而下士官和水兵中也有不少「文豪」。揷畫和卡通全都有出神入妙的描畫，然而美人國却成為每刋必有的精神食糧，這或許因為讀者都是靑年人，具有性的煩悶所致。而最有興味老，就是新聞的價格，士官以上者每月三角，候補生兩角，而水兵只一角二分，遠可以說是最公道的價格。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>從這個艦內新聞上，眞人等永遠不能忘記地知道了平沼內閣的總辭職。以及日英會談的決裂。九月四日這一天，艦隊從高雄航向歸途，而碇泊於厦門。「磐手新聞」用特大的標題，佔滿着全頁，刋登務英法對據的宜戰書。</p>
<p>「竟開火了！」在晚飯後休息的時間，在甲板上的烟灰碟周圍團聚着的候補生，其中構成一個團體的四位同屋，首先加藤開嘴了。近熱帶的海港，遺遠的後背，掛着被太陽烤紅了的霞雲，逐漸變為紫色，而有黃昏的景象了。</p>
<p>說「竟開火了」這樣的話，並非單單他們四個人，而是整個艦隊將士的主要談話中心。</p>
<p>「一定會擴大的！」中野這樣回答了一句。</p>
<p>「當然會擴大的。」岡山很堅定的承認這一點。</p>

        <h1>1944.04.08</h1>
<h3>DO NOT BE LAZY</h3>
<p>This year is designated as the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. Like a relay race, this is the final leg. The person running this leg must rouse their spirit, grit their teeth, and advance bravely, without stopping for a single step, towards the finish line. This is the crucial moment for victory or defeat, as well as life or death. It is the most important and also the most tense. This is the meaning of the decisive year.</p>
<p>The Book of Documents says: "To build a mountain of nine ren high, one basket of earth is lacking to complete it." Confucius said: "Suppose I am making a mountain, and have stopped when one basketful is wanting to complete it, I stop. Suppose I am throwing down earth on level ground, though I have thrown only one basketful, I am going forward." Zhu Xi annotated: "To stop halfway is to abandon all previous efforts. Whether to stop or to go forward depends entirely on ourselves and not on others." All of this teaches people that at critical junctures, they must not give up halfway. They must strive for self-improvement and be determined to be outstanding, otherwise they will face the abandonment of all previous efforts. Success or failure, gain or loss, hinges on a single thought, on "our" own efforts. If we do not work hard ourselves, we cannot hope that others will do the work for us. If we do not work hard ourselves, we cannot hope for accidental success. Only by using "our" own blood and sweat can we exchange for "our" own success. There is no other path besides this.</p>
<p>People living in this great era, looking at the current situation, know that the achievements of the Greater East Asia War over the past two years have already laid the foundation for inevitable victory amidst hardship and difficulty. Eighty or ninety percent of the work has already been done, and we still need to continue to do the remaining ten or twenty percent of the work. However, this ten or twenty percent of work requires us to redouble our efforts, redouble our hardships, and redouble our struggles. We do not want to "fail for lack of one basket of earth." We do not want to "abandon all previous efforts." Then everyone must rise up, take on all responsibilities, and move forward. At this time, everything depends entirely on ourselves and not on others. Let us determine our own destiny through our own efforts. In this regard, we are willing to offer this to the people of the country, hoping that the entire nation, from top to bottom, will be inspired.</p>
<p>The government should be inspired, constantly reflecting on how much it has done for the country and how much welfare it has sought for the people. If it has not done much, or has not done enough, then from now on it should do it immediately, it should do more immediately. If it does not have the ability to do it, does not have the ability to do more, then from now on it should employ the talents of the entire country and work together quickly. Being unable to advance or retreat is most harmful to the country. In normal times, perhaps it is still possible to wait, but in the last five minutes of an extraordinary period, there is no room for delay.</p>
<p>The people should be inspired, constantly reflecting on how much they have done for the country in their respective positions. Especially those engaged in production, how much has production increased, how much strength has been contributed. Do not use the excuse of environmental difficulties, because this is a common phenomenon in any country during wartime. Other countries, the more they are at war, the more they show the strength of the people. It can be seen that the environment cannot hinder a person's progress. Only those who cannot be enterprising are controlled by the environment. Furthermore, individual wealth is linked to the wealth of the country. Only with the overall wealth of the country can individual wealth be preserved, otherwise, "when the skin is gone, what can the hair attach to?" Therefore, valuing national interests is valuing personal interests. Keep this thought in mind at all times, be inspired at all times, and work hard for the country. Only then can the country and nation be revived, and the people can enjoy peace and happiness.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Braving Bad Weather Night Raid Silchar City – Enemy Military Installations Heavily Damaged in Several Locations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma, on the Burmese front, a Japanese army air force bomber squadron braved bad weather on the night of the 3rd, launching a strong attack on Silchar in eastern India, shaking the enemy's rear base for the defense of Imphal. Another unit of Japanese planes, after bombing the airfield north of Silchar, further dropped bombs on marked enemy positions, destroying two of its facilities. At the same time, another team of Japanese planes, eliminating the alert of three enemy fighter planes, flew to Silchar and safely returned to base after destroying military installations in the city.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Calcutta, the Assam provincial government issued a public statement on the 6th, stating that Japanese forces bombed Silchar and Imphal on the night of the 3rd.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Calcutta, the government of Assam province in India announced on the 6th that the anti-Axis forces are currently engaged in battle with the Japanese army on the Manipur front. Therefore, the bombing of Assam by Japanese planes will be intensified compared to before. It is expected that many people will be injured. In this situation, blood transfusions are needed for the injured. Therefore, in order to store blood serum, the general public is asked to provide their own blood.</p>
<h3>Enemy Airborne Troops in Burma Experiencing Famine – Japanese Planes Compete to Attack Kalat Airfield</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The enemy airborne troops on the upper Irrawaddy River have shown signs of wavering since the death of their commander Wingate. Therefore, the enemy Southeast Asia Commander Mountbatten recently encouraged them, saying: "Wingate's death is irrelevant to the overall situation. We still expect much from you in the future." However, supplies of food and ammunition rely solely on airborne supplies, which are extremely difficult to obtain. Therefore, the main force of the enemy troops is on the verge of famine. Mountbatten's words are mere empty talk. They are everywhere subject to fierce attacks by powerful Japanese units, and many have scattered and fled.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese army air force in Burma, since the attack on the 28th, had temporarily remained silent, monitoring the enemy airborne troops' movements. From the 3rd of this month, it launched another fierce attack on the enemy airborne troops. The translation of the situation is as follows: At dusk on the 3rd, a Japanese fighter squadron suddenly launched a surprise attack on the enemy airfield at Kalat (50 kilometers northwest of Kazha), 15 kilometers northwest of Namy. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire was exceptionally fierce. The Japanese planes attacked with machine guns and cannons, destroying its strength. An unidentified number of Japanese dive bombers launched a strong attack on the enemy airfield at Kalat, carrying out accurate bombing at extremely low altitude. After destroying the facilities at the airfield, all planes safely returned to base.</p>
<h3>New Currency System Implemented in Free India – Views of Japanese Economic Circles</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – After learning of the news that the Provisional Government of Free India has established a bank and implemented a currency system, economic commentators have all expressed their blessings to the provisional government and the Indian people, and expressed their views, saying: The Provisional Government of India's implementation of its own currency system this time, with the new bank having opened on the 5th, is because India was previously forced by Britain to adopt the silver standard system, so that it could extract as much Indian gold as possible and transport it to London. This was a clever plan by Britain to plunder gold. On April 1, 1927, Britain, disregarding the strong opposition of the Indian people, implemented the gold standard system in India, causing the Indian people to suffer extreme oppression under the system. Now that India is independent and has restored the right to its own currency, this move is truly laudable.</p>
<h3>Discord Between British and American Leaders</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Since the loudly proclaimed total counteroffensive in Burma last year suffered repeated defeats, the American leadership has recently disregarded the active offensive of the American military leadership and released pessimistic remarks about the defeat on the Qian (Burma) front, hoping to shift the responsibility for the defeat onto others. According to enemy air force prisoners captured recently in northern Burma, Mountbatten, in mid-January, when inspecting the glider training of the airborne troops, made the following speech to British and American soldiers in Laladpur near Gaya in Bihar: "Before the war against Germany ends, I am afraid we cannot actively attack Burma." The propaganda of the total counteroffensive in Burma, after being threatened by the fierce attacks of the Japanese side, has exposed the discord within the enemy leadership.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Visits Prime Minister Pibun</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubogami, accompanied by Counselor Ishii, visited Thai Prime Minister Pibun at the Prime Minister's residence at 5:00 PM on the 6th, discussing matters for a long time before departing.</p>
<h3>Burmese People Organize the Arakan Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Indian National Army is fighting fiercely in the Arakan region, and there are many areas where the cooperation of Burmese residents is needed. Therefore, the Indian and Burmese people have joined hands to rise up and jointly protect East Asia. A large number of Burmese people have voluntarily taken up arms and swords to participate in the battle in response to the Indian National Army's operations, under the name "Arakan Volunteer Army." They have traditionally lived in the dense forests and are particularly skilled in guerrilla warfare. The "Arakan Volunteer Army" was organized around January of last year by Arakan Sinha. The British air force did not realize Wavell's dream of retaking Burma, and carried out guerrilla warfare centered on Nissi. The British Indian army invaded their homes, and Sinha, in order to defend his home, gathered a number of young people, organized a volunteer army, and appointed Kra Win as commander. As a result, the momentum grew stronger, cooperating with the Japanese army, either infiltrating enemy positions as spies to gather intelligence, or annihilating enemy troops, establishing special merits. The enemy army is also deeply aware that the activities of the volunteer army are a fatal blow to them, and said that "the reason for the previous Arakan tragedy was caused by our abuse of the Burmese people." During the rainy season, when the enemy army launched a counteroffensive, they organized a strategic unit, led by Basant, a former forestry officer in the Nissi area, to appease the Burmese people on the border and began to sabotage the volunteer army's work, but all were unsuccessful. The number of Burmese youth joining the volunteer army is increasing daily. It is said that in mid-March, a Burmese boy named Ja Dan, only fifteen years old, encouraged by his mother, hung a Burmese knife around his waist and enthusiastically joined the volunteer army, setting off to the front line to fight, greatly boosting the morale of the entire army. At the end of February of this year, an enemy force of about 5,000 troops moved south along the Kaladan River. The Japanese army and the volunteers immediately ambushed them, cutting off their retreat. The enemy army was in great chaos and fled to the dense forest area on the river bank. The local residents also, under the command of the volunteer army, sharpened bamboo into spears, and tracked and chased them. In the villages and towns south of Kaktok, all the Burmese people turned out to pursue the enemy army, and in Cakiief, they arrested an Englishman and more than a dozen British soldiers. Also, on March 12, a member of the self-defense corps, Mon Ha, single-handedly killed several enemy soldiers and captured one alive. The activities of the local residents are truly noteworthy. The enemy army, in view of the previous failure, shouted that the Burmese people must not be mistreated this time, but their looting behavior has increased the hatred of the residents. Therefore, the residents along the border, under the leadership of the volunteer army, are all filled with the fighting spirit to overthrow Britain.</p>

<h3>From Ensuring Public Security and Stabilizing People's Livelihood to Reforming the Local Political System</h3>
<p>— Ding Mocun</p>
<p>The Shen Bao editorial on April 5th discussed "Reforming the Local Political System." At the same time, Xinmin Jun's article "Preliminary Views on the Reform of the Local Administrative System" was published, elaborating on the importance of the local administrative system and offering many suggestions on the steps for reforming the local administrative system. I am also deeply interested in this issue, and I dare to express my views for discussion among all parties.</p>
<p>Currently, everyone hopes to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood. Of course, stabilizing people's livelihood is the most important part of the national government's policy; suppressing prices is the most basic means of stabilizing people's livelihood. However, suppressing prices does not seem simple. The most important thing is to increase production, so that materials are fully supplied; and to dredge sources, so that material exchanges are smooth. Forcing suppression and price limits are superficial. These principles have been commonly understood by those who discuss the issue of prices today.</p>
<p>However, if we want to achieve the goals of increasing production and smoothing material exchanges, there is a very important prerequisite, which is to ensure public security. If public security cannot be ensured, then increasing production may encounter unexpected disturbances in the process, affecting the expected results. After production, unexpected opportunities may be lost. For example, in agricultural production, due to poor public security, farmers' work and rest are erratic, reducing harvests. Even if the harvest is not reduced, but the harvested agricultural products fall into the hands of others or are blocked by bandits, making it impossible to export them from rural areas, it is also a waste of effort. Another example is industrial production. Due to poor public security, work is constantly interrupted, reducing output. As a result, not only can production not be increased, but it is reduced. Furthermore, if public security cannot be ensured, the transportation of materials, whether by boat or by vehicle, is subject to obstruction at any time, making smooth exchanges impossible. Therefore, ensuring public security directly protects increased production and the transportation of materials, and indirectly assists in suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about ensuring public security. The basic methods are nothing more than clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists. Suppressing the communists is certainly part of the work of clearing the countryside, but at present, with the rampant communists, suppressing the communists is the most urgent work in clearing the countryside. Furthermore, clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists are the basic methods for ensuring public security and should be jointly undertaken by all departments of the national government as the focus of current work. It is by no means that a certain agency can bear it alone, nor is it that a certain group of people can bear it alone. Agencies and agencies, government and people, should unite and mobilize as a whole.</p>
<p>How to mobilize as a whole? It can be divided into vertical and horizontal aspects: Vertical mobilization means that the central, provincial, municipal, county, district, and rural levels are consistently implemented. Horizontal mobilization means that military, political, economic, and cultural aspects are promoted simultaneously. Only in this way can a consistent execution vertically and a simultaneous advancement horizontally achieve the effectiveness of the entire mobilization and ensure public security.</p>
<p>Relying solely on military implementation of clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists can be effective for a while, but after the military period has passed, latent bandits will rise again from the ashes. In particular, the communist party and New Fourth Army bandits are completely lurking in the villages and towns. When the national army enters to suppress them, they escape without a trace. When the national army is transferred, they come out and run rampant. Because past suppression has focused on military affairs, and the coordination with political, economic, and cultural aspects has been insufficient, the cooperation between the government and the people has also been insufficient. In other words, the vertical mobilization and horizontal mobilization have not been perfected, so they cannot eradicate the root cause, making it easy for them to rise again from the ashes.</p>
<p>Some people say that the central government is the point (the focus of the entire country), the provinces and cities are the lines, and the counties and rural areas are the plane. The reason why public security has not been fully established today may also be due to the fact that all parties have previously excessively neglected the "plane." Because the "plane" has been too neglected, the bandits and communists have become increasingly rampant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the past, all parties not only excessively neglected the "plane" problem, but even accelerated and deepened its deterioration. This was certainly not intentional, but even if it was out of ignorance, its harm to the "plane" cannot be avoided. For example, corrupt county magistrates or corrupt district chiefs are often used by others and protected on their behalf. In this way, how can the "plane" problem not become increasingly serious?</p>
<p>From the perspective of the entire political system, the central government leads the provinces, and the provinces lead the counties, but the implementation of government orders and policies, the assurance of public security, and the stabilization of people's livelihood are still at the county level. After the return to the capital, those who talked about reforming politics seemed not to have reached the county level, and I have often been greatly puzzled. I previously consoled myself that it might be my personal prejudice, but judging from the current rampant situation of bandits and communists, my views do not seem to be without any basis. Currently, there are indeed many points that can be discussed regarding public security and people's livelihood, but merely blaming the central government or blaming a few central leaders is, based on the above reasons, not a fair opinion. The central government is constantly thinking about governing diligently, but because the local system is unsound and local personnel do not meet expectations, the central government is also unable to do what it wants.</p>
<p>In short, strengthening the national government, increasing its strength, so that it can fulfill its responsibility to Greater East Asia, is the common goal of all parties. How to strengthen the national government and increase its strength? Ensuring public security and stabilizing people's livelihood are the basic conditions, and ensuring public security and stabilizing people's livelihood have a mutually promoting and mutually causal effect. To ensure public security and stabilize people's livelihood (including clearing the countryside and suppressing the communists), in terms of verticality, the central, provincial, municipal, county, district, and rural areas must be mobilized as a whole; in terms of horizontality, political, economic, cultural, and military aspects must be fully coordinated. The foundation of all work is on the "plane." The results are also harvested on the "plane." Therefore, the "plane" problem should be earnestly improved in the future.</p>
<p>As for the improvement of the "plane," the local system and local personnel must be reformed simultaneously. Only a good system can attract truly incorruptible and capable talents, and only truly incorruptible and capable talents can use a good system. With the current local system, even if there are truly capable, honest, and incorruptible talents, they have no way to display their strengths or realize their ambitions, and can only ask for trouble.</p>
<p>I strongly agree with the Shen Bao editorial on April 5th and the views on reforming the local system contained therein, and I hope that all parties will pay more attention to them.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Faces Difficulties Implementing Constitutional Government – Unable to Cope with the Public – Extremely Anxious Internally and Externally</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report – Regarding Chongqing's implementation of constitutional government, with a five-year focus, according to information revealed by this city, Hang Liwu, a member of the visiting British delegation sent by Chongqing, gave a speech on his personal views on Chongqing's constitutional government upon his recent return to Chongqing. The content of the speech stated: With the date of implementing constitutional government approaching, it is hoped that the Chongqing government will establish people's institutions at all levels as soon as possible, so that the people have the opportunity to participate in politics. It is also hoped that the people of various places will send representatives to fulfill their responsibilities, adopt sovereignty, and not make the people's institutions a tool for personal interests. Adopt the rule of law, because the law is higher than everything, with two meanings: One is that the existence of arbitrary power is absolutely not allowed, and the people will not be punished without due process of law. The second is that government officials, regardless of their private capacity or their civil servant status, will be subject to the same legal sanctions as ordinary people if they violate the law. Second, the people have basic freedoms, including the right to vote, and are allowed to freely elect personnel, form a government, and advocate changing and opposing the government by peaceful means. The people should also be free to criticize the government and propose political discussions. They can also oppose illegal arrests and prohibitions by the government, and can use the opportunity of speech to demand personal freedom. This is the basic freedom that the people must have under constitutional government, otherwise democratic constitutional government cannot exist. The Chinese "Five-Five Draft Constitution" already has clear provisions on these three basic freedoms of the people. Even during the period of political tutelage, there were already civil law regulations. During this wartime, the country cannot but impose considerable restrictions on the freedom of the people. In order to realize constitutional government and gradually move forward, it is hoped that the government will relax restrictions on opportunities for speech within the possible range, and implement the protection of the people's personal freedom in advance. In addition, it is hoped that the people will have a spirit of abiding by the law, so as to gradually increase freedom, so that the people's right to freedom will not be abused. In short, the implementation of constitutional government seeks mutual progress. In addition to hoping that the government will open up political power, it is hoped that the people will fulfill their responsibilities. Therefore, regarding the Chongqing people's demands for opening up the ban on parties and implementing local organization and local autonomy, the entire territory of Chongqing is in turmoil. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek is unable to deal with these demands. The proposal to implement constitutional government passed at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Chongqing government last year is already in a difficult position, tantamount to tying one's own hands. And the United Kingdom and the United States have doubts about Chongqing, and have seriously discussed whether it is moving towards a democratic country or a democratic path. Therefore, Chongqing is currently very anxious about dealing with internal and external affairs.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu and Others Visit Manchukuo Ambassador Lü</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Foreign Minister Chu, Vice Minister, and our Ambassador to Manchukuo Chen, visited Manchukuo Ambassador Lü Rongshi yesterday (7th) at 7:00 PM. The Manchukuo Ambassador hosted a dinner, and a cordial discussion was held, lasting a long time.</p>
<h3>Serious Dispute Between Chongqing and Mongolia – Shooting at Cossacks – Outer Mongolia Issues a Serious Statement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report – According to reliable sources in this city, the friction and disputes between Chongqing and Outer Mongolia are quite serious. The Soviet influence in Xinjiang Province is quite expansive, and Chongqing has taken various countermeasures to prevent this. First, Chongqing instigated Sheng Shicai, chairman of the Xinjiang provincial government, to expel Soviet forces. On the one hand, it strengthened Chongqing's forces in Xinjiang, specially established a provincial party headquarters, hoping to use the Kuomintang's forces to build the foundation of the provincial government, but secretly to implement surveillance, so there are many signs of unrest in Xinjiang Province. In addition, the fact that Chongqing's army crossed the border into Outer Mongolia in Xinjiang was also seriously noted by Outer Mongolia. On the 4th of this month, the government of the People's Republic of Outer Mongolia in Kulun issued a statement, which stated that in December of last year, the Cossack people were nomads in northern Xinjiang. The Xinjiang provincial government ordered their pursuit. After an investigation by Outer Mongolia in the mountain gorges in the southwest, the chased people have moved east to the north. In order to comply with the international spirit of justice and the Mongolian constitution, refugee camps were set up along the way in the territory under its jurisdiction, and the right to live in the territory was granted. However, the new province still pursued them, firing shots indiscriminately, causing many Outer Mongolian people's villages to be hit by bullets. Afterwards, the Outer Mongolian army launched an effective counterattack, confronting each other. On March 20 of this year, the new Chongqing army was finally repelled. It was also said that in order to strengthen defense, the Outer Mongolian border will take necessary measures to deal with the situation.</p>
<h3>Guo Pei'er Writes Article on Germany's Potential, Resolves to Strive to Fulfill its Mission</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency, the "German Weekly" published a recent essay by Minister of Propaganda Guo Pei'er, stating that Germany's geographical situation and general way of life force Germans to work harder than other countries in order to ensure national survival. After a long period of struggle, the German people have developed this extraordinary energy and efficiency, and the progress of this war proves the truth of this argument. We have been at war with the four major world powers for five years and can still maintain our current position. We rely entirely on our own strength to deal with some overt enemies and covert foes. The enemy has repeatedly underestimated our strength, limited by prejudices from which they cannot escape. Therefore, on the Eastern Front, the Germans are dealing with an enemy twice their size with only half the manpower. At the same time, in Italy, a small number of German troops are facing the superior manpower and resources of the two major powers, Britain and the United States, preventing the enemy from achieving their goals. Imagine if the enemy's advantages were used by us, or if the enemy had to fight on all fronts as we do, what would the result be? Modern Germans have endured hardships in completing their mission that almost exceed human endurance. As for the loss of property due to air raids, we express our respect to the Germans who have suffered sacrifices. If there is any possibility of avoiding sacrifices, we will do our best to do so. In short, we are facing a new era.</p>
<h3>Equestrian Festival in Kyoto Postponed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - Today (the 7th) is the third Equestrian Festival since the Greater East Asia War. Every year on this day, the allied nation of Japan holds a memorial service for warhorses that died in battle and a grand equestrian event for military-national cooperation in the valley. The Japanese authorities in the capital had planned to hold the above event today, but due to the moldy rain and the ground not being dry, it has been specially postponed to 2:30 PM on the 16th of this month at the Xiaoying training ground for the memorial service and equestrian event.</p>
<h3>North China Education Headquarters Implements Wartime Education</h3>
<p>Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Education Headquarters of the North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government has issued an order to implement an emergency mobilization in order to implement wartime education for all students in North China. The first important task is to dig air raid shelters and trenches. After receiving the order, each school immediately directed students to start work separately. The Education Headquarters also sent personnel to supervise and encourage the work, which is expected to be completed within a few days. A general order has also been issued to the provinces and cities of North China, setting a deadline for completion.</p>
<h3>Battle for the Important Port of Odessa Unfolds, German Rear Guard Defends Double Fortress</h3>
<p>Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Moscow news, although Soviet troops occupied Tukarat, 55 kilometers southeast of Ternopol, and surrounded powerful German forces in the area, the German side has denied this. Elsewhere, Soviet telegrams continue to exert heavy pressure on the Odessa region. According to a Moscow telegram, the Malinovsky army, advancing on Odessa from three directions, has reached Ladier Nanaia, 38 kilometers north of Odessa, and Kubanga, 14 kilometers northeast of Odessa. Berlin news also stated that German rear guard troops are currently engaged in fierce battles in the extensive bridgehead of Odessa. It is reported that there are two important fortress positions around Odessa, which are sufficient to prevent the advance of the army.</p>
<p>Luo Hong's Army Cooperates, War Situation Tends to Stabilize</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to the Haitong News Agency: Fresh German forces and Romanian troops are fighting the enemy in the Prut River area, while Hungarian troops are fighting fiercely in front of the Carpathian Mountains, and the front line has been greatly stabilized. The German forces between the lower reaches of the Tiligul River, the Dniester River, and the Prut River are resisting while retreating, safely transporting all war equipment and heavy equipment. The German rear guard in Odessa is resisting with double fortress fortifications. On Wednesday, the enemy still failed to break through these fortifications to reach the lower reaches of the Dniester River. The failure of this offensive has affected the enemy forces advancing from Balti to Kishinev in the central sector. The enemy's attacks along the Tiraspol-Iasi railway have been unsuccessful, and Romanian troops are vigorously resisting Soviet forces crossing the Prut River north of Iasi. On Wednesday, German troops crossed the Dniester River from Skala Kamennazy Badursk towards Cernauti and west to avoid encirclement by the enemy. There is fierce fighting for Brody and Kovel. German troops in Kovel broke through and advanced northwest, meeting German troops coming to rescue from the north and northwest. Kovel is now within the main German battle line. The enemy offensive south of Lake Peipus in the northern sector has now extended to the Ostrov district. It seems that the enemy's offensive in the southern sector has been blocked, and they intend to stir up trouble in the northern sector.</p>

At the same time, the Department of the Army stated that it still needs to add 77,500 troops per month in order to maintain the current troop strength, but the Department of the Navy believes that it is still 300,000 personnel short of the original plan. The department expects to have 3.5 million naval personnel by July 1 this year.</p>
<h3>Laval's Speech Declares National Policy, Seeking Welfare for the Motherland</h3>
<p>Vichy, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency: Laval delivered a speech at a French military officer's opportunity, strongly arguing that he had done his best and had not done anything harmful to France. It is said that in 1936, he told a certain American reporter that there would be a war between governments that believed in communism and fascism. France has a long history. Today, you are fighting for our country, but in the season of 1940, there was no other option but to sign an armistice agreement. He also said that among you are socialists, communists, and monarchists. Regardless of your future, I hope you will cooperate with each other and unite as one. France is a great country, and I hope the public will not hesitate to sacrifice to seek the survival of the country.</p>
<h3>Greek Government in Exile Resigns</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 7th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News, according to London Radio broadcast: The Greek government in exile has accepted the resignation of the Tsouderos government.</p>
<h3>New Trends in the European War Situation</h3>
<p>The Second Front Issue: In his parliamentary speech on February 22, Churchill stated: "The current Anglo-American air raids on Germany are the foundation for an upcoming invasion of Europe." Regarding this, according to the German authorities' view, the enemy may attempt to invade the mainland somewhere, or simultaneously in several places. However, Germany has full confidence that no matter where the enemy lands, it can be defeated at any time. At the end of last year, the enemy appointed Eisenhower as the commander-in-chief, reorganized the front line, and began the continental invasion operation. The German side also appointed Field Marshal Rommel as the commander-in-chief, personally inspected the Atlantic coast, and further strengthened the iron-clad Atlantic defense line.</p>
<p>Recently, Guo Pei'er, Minister of Propaganda, determined in the Great German Newspaper that "the period of the Anglo-American planned invasion of Western Europe is gradually approaching." According to the combined observations of powerful German journalists or neutral countries, the invasion of Western Europe will be soon. As Churchill said in his speech, the large-scale attacks will intensify from this spring to summer, so the foundation for the air and land invasion cannot be completed without the bean season.</p>
<p>In short, the Anglo-American method is to limit losses to a minimum. If they can do this, they will be relieved. Churchill's plan is to first defeat the German Air Force, especially the fighters, and only after fully controlling the air force will he leisurely implement the landing. Therefore, if we can boldly predict the timing of the opening of the second front, it will probably be in the summer.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is no consensus on the issue of the invasion battlefield. Generally speaking, the main force may land along the Atlantic coast of the English Channel. Some speculate that it will be the Danish coast, but experts consider it too far away and quite difficult, and fighter support is also slightly too far away. There is also the Norway theory, but firstly, it is easy to defend and difficult to attack in terms of terrain. Even if it can be landed, it is difficult to attack the German mainland, and there are many barriers. As for the first attack on the Balkans, it involves the Balkan issue politically, and at the same time, the United States and Britain must first recognize the Soviet sphere of influence, so its feasibility is low. Furthermore, judging from the recent Anglo-American attitude towards Spain, we cannot conclude that the Iberian Peninsula landing theory is impossible. In response to this, as I said before, we have a winning chance no matter where the enemy comes from. We might as well say that the war situation has changed to a good opportunity to attack Britain.</p>
<p>German Retaliatory Bombing</p>
<p>Churchill once said that Germany had to concentrate four-fifths of its existing fighters on the western front because of the Anglo-American air raids. In fact, since last autumn, the movement of German troops has not been affected by the enemy's air strikes on the Eastern Front and the Italian Front, but to prepare for the Anglo-American invasion of Europe. Therefore, it is wrong to think that the retreat at various points on the Eastern Front is a phenomenon caused by this. The current stage of Germany's war against the Soviet Union is a so-called evasive operation, allowing the enemy to take advantage of the situation and send its reserve troops and troops to attack. The German side resisted at every point to avoid increasing its own losses and to lure the enemy. On the other hand, Anglo-American propaganda says that Germany's aircraft production capacity has been reduced by 45 percent due to air raids. This figure is also incorrect. What the enemy is trying to do is nothing more than what Churchill said to annihilate German fighters. In fact, this is exactly the case, planning to bomb German cities related to aircraft factories. The question is how effective this move is. Speaking of this point, analyzing the distance between previous propaganda and facts, we can know that Germany has not suffered such a big blow. Taking the suburbs of Berlin as an example, although they have been subjected to such blind bombing, the factories have not been destroyed to an unimaginable degree. Most of the victims are ordinary residences, churches, hospitals, etc. Germany had already made thorough preparations to completely disperse the factories and did not suffer as advertised and planned by the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Recent Situation on the Eastern Front</p>
<p>Finally, speaking of the recent developments on the Eastern Front, as I said before, Germany's operational guidelines in the German-Soviet War are to abandon territory and make the enemy bleed. Germany is not fleeing in defeat, and the morale of the soldiers is by no means depressed, so when the Soviet Union continued its offensive for about eight months since last July and showed fatigue, it switched to offensive. At least it can be said that in that situation, the German side was fully prepared and willing to counterattack when necessary. As for when or where this will happen, it is of course impossible to predict.</p>
<p>Some people have observed that the Soviet Union is taking the offensive and advancing comprehensively, with its northern border in the Baltic states, its central border in the old Polish territory, and its southern border approaching the Romanian border, so Germany may take some new actions to stop it. What is now a problem is the Soviet Union's enemy rule work in Finland, which is also quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>In the face of this serious situation, the essence of this war, the proposition of national survival, has become a real problem and must be fought to the end. Churchill himself frankly admitted this. As long as the front and rear have this strong determination, as long as there is preparation to complete a long-term war, neither the Soviet offensive, nor the Anglo-American strengthened air raids, nor even the second front can make Germany submit.

<h3>Dedication of Scrap Metal Promoted Smoothly, First Batch from Various Agencies Sent Out</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the campaign to collect scrap metal in this city, all agencies, organizations, and people from all walks of life have been able to recognize the importance of this move, so they have all actively carried it out, and the results have been exceptionally satisfactory.

<h3>Salt Field Captain Refutes Wild and Absurd Rumors in American Newspapers; Analyzes Reasons for Enemy Failure on Palau Island</h3>
<p>Salt Field Captain, representative of the Japanese Fleet Press Department stationed in China, yesterday afternoon, at the joint press conference at Mu Haiwai, gave a detailed explanation of the reasons for the enemy's failure in the Pacific, and denounced the enemy's unfounded propaganda.</p>
<p>Enemy Losses</p>
<p>Salt Field first stated that the Japanese army on Palau Island and Yap Island adopted a bleeding tactic, saying: At that time, the enemy used only ten or so large ships, attempting to invade the Japanese positions on the 23rd. However, enemy Colonel Knox claimed: The use of more than fifty giant battleships and said launch of the Nimitz offensive, ready to South Pacific Philippine Manila dispatched, turning to southern China. However, the enemy's operation completely collapsed and failed. At this time, the so-called enemy large fleet to Palau Island, no more than an educational material, the enemy also difficult to break through the difficulties, deeply worried. Salt Field Captain pointed out that there are two reasons for the enemy's failure: first, Palau Island did not have any slight attack, second, planning to make a head-on battle with the Japanese fleet, this time the enemy fleet was manipulated by the Japanese fleet, resulting in the enemy losing two battleships, one aircraft carrier, one large battleship, two cruisers, therefore the enemy's operation in the Pacific, due to Nogus's lies, the so-called fifty or so large fleets participating in the operation, collapse on their own. However, they are trying to deceive the American public, and even more difficult to cope with. The New York Times has made a boring defense on behalf of Washington, saying; large American fleet did not encounter the Japanese Navy, southwestern Pacific completely under its control, countless southern islands, all under its suppression, and so on.</p>
<p>Beneficial to Japan</p>
<p>Salt Field Captain denounced this one-sided remark, considering it baseless, and analyzed it: The New York Times's unfounded propaganda, saying that the U.S. used its fleet to invade, yet has not achieved the slightest effect, if the Japanese fleet wants to have a head-on battle with it, or not a head-on battle, it is Japan's freedom, but the Japanese Navy only used a small number of air forces and naval forces to severely attack the enemy American fleet, heavily damaging the enemy, this is also the Japanese fleet's freedom, such as the U.S. fleet's supply line is longer, the more beneficial to Japan, if the enemy's large fleet passes, does not attack the Japanese army on the spot, and the Japanese army will naturally take advantage of the enemy's defenselessness to attack, so not taking a head-on battle with the enemy fleet, that is, Palau Island enemy temporarily difficult to attempt to attack. The so-called southwestern Pacific under their control, is not true, at the start of the war, the fleet wherever it goes, not necessarily the area occupied, in military tactics there is also this guidance, stealing sea power is not limited to time and space, difficult to immediately occupy, so Japan's air supremacy in the southwestern Pacific will not allow the enemy to invade, that is, if the enemy has already obtained southwestern Pacific air supremacy, then fifty or so large ships, still do not meet the need, this is because there are many islands there, all Japanese strategic strongholds and bases for operation, if this operation the U.S. immediately obtained southwestern Pacific air supremacy, then it would not have been delayed until now without being realized.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Victory</p>
<p>The so-called attack suppress countless southern islands, check these islands, all occupied by Japan, in terms of distance alone, in terms of supply Japan is closer than the United States, so the New York Times's unfounded words, is no more than a report of the U.S. operation's result. The victory gained by the Japanese fleet, has also been proven here, and the air defense force is extremely strong. Now, even judging the progress of the war in terms of time, the recent increase in Japanese aircraft technicians and the increase in aviation personnel, therefore the progress of the war, will not be far away. Furthermore, the longer the U.S. supply line, the better the opportunity for Japan's operation, so in the south the bases gained by the Japanese Navy, have gradually become fortresses, from the current point of view, although the enemy is bluffing, but in the near future, Japan will eventually wipe them out in one fell swoop, we can wait and see, this enemy's counterattack, the failure suffered, still attempting to cover up domestic, but the news released by the Japanese headquarters on the fourth of this month, is only a part of it, so the information released by the enemy, always uses the information released by Japan as a basis. At the time of this press campaign war, Japan is also one step ahead of the enemy, especially the reports released by the Japanese headquarters, people all over the world believe it to be correct, the American people all know, so the U.S. Navy Department for the traces of failure, also difficult to satisfy.</p>

<h3>Spring Cocoon Harvest Approaching: Silk Factories Rush to Resume Production; Thirty Silk Factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Have Accepted</h3>
<p>After Huazhong Silk Co., Ltd. was disbanded in accordance with the implementation of the Japanese new policy towards China, the Ministry of Industry represented the Chinese side's in-kind investment in various silk factories, liquidated and settled accounts. After several meetings, the liquidation was completed in mid-last month. Now, in view of the approaching spring cocoon harvest and in order to ensure that all silk factories resume operation in a timely manner, the Ministry of Industry specially dispatched Wang Shuchun, Director of the Industrial Department, and Xu Qingdeng, assistant to the Director, to Wuxi, Jiaxing, Xiashi, Wei'an, Hangzhou and other places, to preside over the handover matters of various silk factories. The results were quite satisfactory. All thirty silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and three warehouses have been fully returned to their original owners. The manufacturers are grateful that the Ministry has taken their difficulties into consideration and tried to simplify the handover procedures so as to expedite the return within the shortest possible time and prevent them from missing the opportunity to harvest cocoons this year. It is reported that the silk factories are rushing to resume operation in order to assist the government's wartime economic policy and strive to increase production.</p>
<h3>Allocation of Materials to Various Industries: Must Be Distributed to Fellow Traders According to Regulations; Non-Members to Be Resolutely Denied Allocation</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that the sales companies receive a sufficient quantity of allocated materials, the authorities have stipulated that any materials allocated to the trade associations of various industries must be distributed to their member traders in accordance with regulations, and no deliberate obstruction or other excuses are allowed; otherwise, approval must be requested. As for the trade associations of various industries, in order to adapt to the current situation, in addition to setting up a commodity evaluation committee, they have also added a commodity allocation team to be responsible for purchasing and distributing materials. However, any materials allocated by the authorities must be fairly distributed to fellow traders, or divided into various levels such as A, B, C, and D, depending on the size of their business scope. Those who are not members of the association should be refused allocation to avoid being manipulated by others; otherwise, they will be subject to legal sanctions by the Standing Committee.</p>

<p>Children's Day Special - Part Four</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Pingjiang Children's Education Institute</h3>
<p>The Pingjiang Children's Education Institute was founded in the winter of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Initially, it was stipulated to adopt only 50 refugee children, but later it gradually expanded, and set its own house, decided to increase the quota to 200, and so far, the total number of people is 173, the largest is 16 years old, the smallest is 8 years old, of which 10 years old accounts for the majority.</p>
<p>Daily Life</p>
<p>In terms of daily life, because of their young age, it is relatively simple. In the morning, they get up at 6:30, eat breakfast at 7:00, and from 7:00 to 8:00 for an hour, it is the children's time to write. After 9:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, except for the time to eat lunch in the middle, it is class time. From first grade to sixth grade, the curriculum is in accordance with the primary school system. After 4:00 in the afternoon, they knit mesh bags or do some carving work, but the income is very meager. This is because they are too young to learn other more difficult handicrafts to increase production.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the institute: Because of the narrowness of the house, there is a feeling of crowding for the existing number of people. This is the actual situation. The institute's house is a total of five rooms on three floors. The first floor is the former auditorium and cafeteria. The second floor is the classroom, a total of four rooms. The desks and chairs in the classrooms are neatly arranged, and the students' homework, calligraphy, essays, and paintings are placed on all four sides. They don't look very special. The third floor is the dormitory, a total of three rooms. The beds are stacked beds, and teachers and children sleep together. Because there are many people, the children share a bed. The bed sheets on each bed are uniformly white, and the pillowcases are folded into a square shape, which looks quite neat. There is a nanny in each room to manage trivial matters such as young children urinating or putting on clothes at night.</p>
<p>Dietary Situation</p>
<p>In terms of diet, there are also two porridge and one rice. Porridge is eaten in the morning and evening, and rice is eaten at noon. As for cooking rice, cooking dishes, washing dishes, and wiping tables, except for buying groceries, the children do everything themselves. When the author went in to visit, it was their lunch time. Many strong children were eating happily. The porridge and rice and dishes are also regulated. Each person has two bowls of porridge and rice per meal, and the dishes are "big pot dishes". Two people share a small basin, and the vegetables are nothing more than green vegetables, radishes, and tofu. Recently, the News Daily Social Service Office has provided them with yellow beans and beef bones twice a week.</p>
<p>The source of funding is supplemented by the Pingjiang Office, and the rest is raised from the outside by the board of directors, but the Pingjiang Office's subsidy only accounts for one-tenth, so most of it is still raised by the board of directors. Currently, the institute's monthly expenditure is 100,000 yuan, and it exceeded 110,000 last month. The institute's education time is six years. After six years, they have the ability to live, and then they are introduced to various professional departments.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sky Wide Sea Vast (Five)</p>
<p>Because the whole house is full of young and strong people, red face arguments often occur, however, at this time, the attitude of the silent and smiling true person, becomes a strange calming special medicine. He read the ship's newspaper, and interjected, "The canvas bathtub that exposes Petty Officer's navel - a short Senryu ditty is quite interesting!"</p>
<p>Thus, the heated argument came to an end in laughter.</p>
<p>The ship's newspaper is a two-page evening paper. The officers who can write and draw are the publishers. It is printed on octavo-sized white paper with a mimeograph, but the content of the editing is quite substantial.</p>
<p>The main thing is the "Iwate Newspaper" and the special headings of Japanese ordinary newspapers. Every day, a few sentences of Emperor Meiji's text are carefully recorded, and then international news is published, the ship's position and course at noon, and the operation schedule for the next day. However, the supplement has a completely different performance, which contains the destination guide, or the wandering in Senryu, and sometimes finds the poems of begging, and the clear words of modern Kant. Of course, the contributors are mostly officers, but there are many "literary giants" among the petty officers and soldiers. The illustrations and cartoons are all exquisitely drawn, but the beauty country has become the spiritual food that must be published every time. This may be because the readers are all young people and have sexual worries. And the most interesting thing is the price of the newspaper, three cents a month for officers and above, two cents for candidates, and only one cent and two points for soldiers, which can be said to be the fairest price.</p>
<p>(Six)</p>
<p>From this ship's newspaper, Masato and others will never forget to know the resignation of the Hiranuma Cabinet. And the breakdown of the Anglo-Japanese talks. On September 4th, the fleet sailed from Kaohsiung on its way home, and was anchored in Xiamen. The "Iwate Newspaper" occupied the entire page with a huge headline, publishing the declaration of war against Britain and France.</p>
<p>"It's finally started!" During the rest time after dinner, the candidates gathered around the ashtray on the deck, and Kato was the first to open his mouth among the four roommates who formed a group. In the subtropical harbor, far away from the back, the sunset glow, which was roasted red by the sun, gradually turned purple, and there was a scene of dusk.</p>
<p>The saying "It's finally started" is not just for the four of them, but the main topic of conversation for the entire fleet.</p>
<p>"It will definitely expand!" Nakano replied.</p>
<p>"Of course it will expand." Okayama firmly admitted this point.</p>

<h3>Yong Shengjun and Others Respond to the Save the Suffering Children Movement</h3>
<p>In order to meet the urgent needs of the environment, this newspaper launched the Save the Suffering Children Movement on Children's Day. Readers have donated money and adopted children. Looking around the streets, groups of suffering children are scavenging for leftovers to survive, and the weak are eating tree bark to fill their hunger. After celebrating Children's Day, if we do not find ways to save the suffering children, it can be said that we are telling a false story. The received aid for refugee children: Yong Shengjun 3,000 yuan, colleagues of New New Hotel 500 yuan, Zhang Weichun 200 yuan, a total of 3,700 yuan in vouchers. (The above amounts are all for relieving the suffering children on the street), with a balance of 136,639.70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Appealing to All Sectors for New Pu Yu Tang</h3>
<p>— Huang Jingwan</p>
<p>Since this newspaper accepted the request from New Pu Yu Tang to continue appealing to all sectors, it has sent reporters to the church to investigate the internal situation and took many photos. The church has a 33-year history of sacrificial service. I dare to introduce it to all sectors. All donations are used properly, and the suffering people really benefit. There are about 900 people currently being sheltered in the church. This great charitable and relief work should be jointly maintained by people from all walks of life. I think that everyone can easily lift it up, and everyone's will becomes a city. At the beginning of March, the church initiated a fundraising of 1.8 million yuan from the press, and a great benefactor added 1.8 million yuan. According to the budget at the time, it could be maintained for six months. Although the fundraising exceeded the goal, the price of everything has skyrocketed, and all prices have doubled compared to the pre-arranged period. The church has no foundation and lacks funds. A savior recently stated to this newspaper that he was willing to donate 1 million yuan in the hope that kind people from all walks of life would donate enthusiastically. In order to encourage all sectors to donate, he stated that for every 1,000 yuan donated by all sectors, he would donate 1,000 yuan to the million, and the savior is a reputable and enthusiastic person in Shanghai, and I can guarantee that what he said will be fulfilled. Therefore, I have no choice but to continue fundraising 1 million yuan from all sectors through this newspaper in order to purchase grain and daily necessities to maintain it until the end of the year. Therefore, I hope that all sectors will help more quickly, regardless of cash, daily necessities, and things that are easy to sell, new and old are welcome. If prices continue to rise for a long time, it will exceed the budget again.</p>
<p>From now on, this office will collect donations on behalf of you. The names and amounts of all donors will be disclosed in the newspaper every day to show great trust. As for the content and photos of the church's sub-sectors, I am afraid that readers are still unclear, so they will be published in sections in this column for all sectors to read. The church is open all day on Saturday every week, welcoming visitors from all walks of life. The address is Guohuo Road, Nanshi.</p>
