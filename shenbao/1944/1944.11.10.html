<h3>日新銳部隊猛攻　雷伊泰展開激戰　摩羅泰敵機塲被切爲兩斷</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　雷伊泰島日守軍，目下在布羅音，塔加米，亞洛（塔加米西北方）等地之西方高地，與約五師團之大敵激戰，予以莫大損害，並待機反攻，本月來敵方有力部隊第二十四師團，侵入瑪那卑那思（雷伊泰島北岸，卡里加拉西方十二公里），逐决向卡里列來　南岸西進，目下於此灣西南角附近，遭日新銳部隊之猛攻，該方面敵軍專取防衛態勢，其一部因日軍作戰巧妙，致被擊潰，然敵方業已整理使用塔克羅班，塔拉克，桑巴布羅及布羅音等各機塲，更企圖運用大型機，日航空部隊現正連日連夜轟炸敵機塲。一方摩羅泰島敵軍已佔領南岸一帶及北岸之一部，在基拉角建設機塲，作爲對雷伊泰島之中繼基地，該島日軍以神出鬼沒轟炸，在十月中旬，將敵機塲分爲東西兩斷，十月二十二日急襲比勞奧敵陣地，殲滅敵兵二百之衆，敵恐懼日軍連日連夜之肉彈攻擊，乃縮短戰綫，日挺身隊出沒敵機塲，已使敵不能使用。柏林九日中央社電德海軍評論家薩爾威比得提督，曾論述菲律</p>
<p>賓海空戰日軍之猛攻及美軍之弱點如次：在各大第戰中，菲律賓海戰乃爲世界所最注目者，日軍對雷伊泰灣之美艦隊，運輸船團及美軍補給綫之戰爭，據現在所得報吿，已獲得新成功，各種類之日海軍部隊，已獲得優異之成功，日軍之航空轟炸隊，連夜攻擊雷伊泰灣之美艦艇運輸船羣。美艦隊現在爲保衛上陸軍及供應上陸軍，仍逗留於雷伊泰灣內，此種美艦隊，雖蒙受重大損害，然仍不得不留置雷伊泰灣中。日軍之魚雷艇隊，攻擊美軍之補給船團，擊沉其運輸船甚多，日軍攻擊美軍之補給綫，以輕艦隊爲主，目下幸美軍尚無安全之空軍基地，其攻擊力完全依靠易遭攻擊之空母，因之短時間內不能獲得穩定之地步，尤其艦隊之停泊地，藉水雷以對付潛水艦魚雷艇之攻擊，仍不能充分，美軍對迅速設立空軍基地，頗有豐當經騐，日軍對此，殊有請求對抗方策之必要。</p>
<p>山下大將就任談話　菲律賓九日中央社電　日山下奉文大將，八日與記者團作首次會見，發表對戰局自信之談話如次：最近於台灣海面，已予敵大機動部隊以崩潰之打擊，其後於菲律賓東方海面，雷伊泰灣，塞班東方，摩羅泰方面等各地，日陸海軍航空部隊與海軍，亦皆獲得戰果，本人對此不勝欣快。此等戰果，皆係以少數之兵力與機械力，根據日本傳統之犧牲精神，凡日本人皆能抱此犧牲精神，以赴國難，自信可把握戰勝之機，吾等現皆以此種精神，從事任務。過去長時間中，日軍於太平洋之較大各島，受敵軍艦艇自四面八方加以射擊，并受空中敵機之轟炸，日軍將士於此孤立無援之下，仍能犧牲，以寡敵衆，戰至全員戰死而後已。余對此唯有衷心表示同情及敬意，本人今後必將努力使吾等之戰鬥力充分發揮也。菲島雖被稱爲島國，但於此廣大地域中，絕不能再使敵軍如以往自由進出之情形，菲律賓於過去時間爲外人所蹂躪，幾次獨立，皆未能成功，其痛憤之情實可想見，現菲律賓到處可見李薩爾之銅像，余對憂國靑年不勝敬仰，同時並表欣喜，菲律賓如今更有多數如李薩爾之存在，菲律賓至今雖獨立僅一年，但吾等於可能範圍內，願盡力扶助其發展，不遜之美國，竟擬抹殺菲律賓之獨立，以大批戰艦，空母與巡洋艦等，侵害菲律賓之安寗，然吾等巳有以死力護術菲律賓之獨立之決心，並使菲律賓將登臨世界舞台，而完成吾人之任務也。</p>
<p>富永中將發表感想　馬尼刺九日中央社電菲律賓方面新日陸軍航空部隊指揮官富永中將，八日下午就本身堅毅不拔之信念，發表感想如下：余此次拜受大命，統帥前綫空軍，誓以一意赴難之決心，貫澈始終。余並信神國日本之國運永無疆，自可爭取最後勝利，余能與赤心報國之英勇將士共同安危，行大義，實無上之光榮也。</p>

<h3>日軍桂江　突入桂林市內　渝軍殘部已漸後退</h3>
<p>術陽九日中央社電　據桂林城外日軍基地訊：進攻桂林日軍已於九日突入桂林市內，蓋在桂林東側桂江對岸待機中之日軍，先於八日午夜在砲兵掩護射擊之下，渡過桂江，九日上午零時十分，初次渡河成功，突入市內，突入地點爲市內東需伏波山與束門之間地區，當市街中央之東側渡河點，其河寬的二百米，連擊東門與對岸之中正橋，已被渝軍破壞，日軍攻入部隊，以民船渡河成功。又桂江東部之另一隊日軍，已佔領要塞七星岩，該地爲防空司令部及可容二萬人之大防洞。北路日軍則佔領北火車站，迫近其西南方高地。另一部隊則佔據桂林新市街之北橋紡織工廠附近，向北門挺進中。計桂林市內火光燭天，黑烟冲霄，隆隆砲聲仍震憾山岳。又據桂林城外日軍基地訊：進攻桂林之日軍部隊，九日拂曉開始總攻，共進攻東方之日軍一部，於敵前渡河突入市內，由北方進攻之日軍，亦已佔領市內新市街之要點，刻正擴大戰果。</p>
<p>桂林城外九日中央社電日快速部隊之先鋒沿湘桂鐵路開始進攻後，繼於三十一日夜追擊渝軍，並突破桂林新市街，衝進桂林城北門附近，惟大部渝軍仍把守城林內外一帶，籍相池密度之防禦火器，由城外週圍之岩山陣地實行反擊，故日軍曾在距郊外四公里之地點，與渝軍對峙。近八日來，日軍發動攻擊極其慎重，連日夜强襲週圍之岩山陣地，以壓制渝軍，至八日傍晚，日攻城軍包圍桂林之攻擊態，已完全整備，乃於九日拂曉在空軍及戰車部隊協力下，開始總攻。茲據被俘渝軍，談桂林城內外之渝守軍計二萬餘人，其中有第三十一軍（桂軍）三師，第二十六軍一師，及第七十九軍二團以上，係渝直系軍四師，其在城內更準備約個月之糧食云。又悉日精銳部隊爲期一舉予該方面渝軍以潰減之打擊，正以決河之勢，直迫渝軍陣地中。</p>

<h3>當局積極籌謀　制止非法勒索　以便安定民生推進國策</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　近來各地物價又益形高漲，以致人民生活日益困難，故政府當局已積極　謀對策，蓋如苛捐雜稅問題不能根本肅淸、則國民經濟之實際安定更不能期望其有正常發展。不寗唯是，在物資流通綫上之非法勒索旣無限度，又無理由，其强征暴歛威嚇脅詐之行爲，允使一班從事農商業者受害匪淺，間接影響人民對增產工作之展開</p>
<p>是以當同對於一切苛捐雜稅，固宜從速加以制止，同時更須設法使此輩橫征暴歛之徒，銷聲匿跡，庶物資來源不受影響，人民生活得轉安泰。如此不僅國民經濟可以由此確立，即使在增產上之國策運營，民心把握，亦必能順利推進，深盼富局對於此速謀對策以應民望。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>重慶的苦悶</h3>
<p>車慶目前在軍事政治及外交等各方面，都面臨着重重窘困。接受全而和平沒有勇氣，而繼續打仗則已無力量，眞所謂進退維谷。</p>
<p>先就車事方面說，河南湖南接連大敗之後，日軍且深入廣西，逼近桂林，柳州等要衝，西南半壁更呈危岌，盟軍從此將與越南一帶的南洋軍隊獲得呼應，這不論在對渝戰事及對英美作戰上，都有重大意義，尤其重慶所受打擊之大可想而知。在最近豫湘桂各决戰役中，渝軍的弱點暴露無遺。號稱精銳的湯恩伯軍胡宗南軍，於隴海路戰役，都不堪一擊。以善戰自誇的薛岳軍也終遭擊潰。敵美雖以空軍相助，並調派將校參加指揮，然而畢竟以戰力懸殊，無法挽救失敗命運。重慶又曾希望在印緬的敵英陸軍及在太平洋的敵美海空軍能够拉住日軍在中中國大陸的前進，可是英軍遭日軍的邀擊而膠住，美軍在台灣菲律賓相繼挫敗，於是重慶冀圖靠外力而解救其危殆的僥倖心也成泡影。</p>
<p>政治方面，渝共磨擦現有加無已。最近，渝共在美國調停之下，曾舉行幾决談判，但觀於王世杰林祖涵單互相攻訐的談話，共黨向渝方提出改組政府的種種要求，可見變方關係不但迄未好轉，且有益加嚴重之勢。又共黨以外的其他各小黨派，對重慶的獨裁政治，也深致不滿，轉而不惜與共黨相勾結，以打算利用共黨的力量，予以克制獨裁，因此共黨就更夜郎自大，囂張跋扈。同時，重慶無利的拖戰，拖得各地經濟破產，民生疾苦，又給予共然對各地人民欺騙煽惑的機會，益使共黨的勢力猖獗。這些影響重慶的政治地位，顯然極大。</p>
<p>至在外交方面，重慶現受英美，特別是敵美的挾制，乃盡人皆知。而英美帝國主義控制中國的野心，是無止境的，最近美國居然更進一步向重慶提出指揮渝軍的統帥權的要求，造成渝美關係的不和，以史蒂威爾離渝事件爲中心的渝美間的裂痕，殊値得注意。重慶對美是吃力不討好，標榜民主主義的美國，對於重慶的獨裁政治，相當不滿，又對渝軍作戰能力的薄弱，則深感失望，因此遂作爲渝軍應受美人指揮的口實。美國想利用中國較多的力量供其驅使，所以它不贊成國共磨擦的擴大，居然以調停自居，且在某些部份支持延安壓迫重慶，眞使重慶有哭不出喊不出之苦。</p>
<p>重慶在軍事，政治，經濟，外交各方面都陷於極端的苦悶，如欲打開苦悶的局面，必須考慮根本政策的改變，那末，重慶有沒有大智大勇的政治家呢！</p>

<h3>盲啞敎育座談會（二）　（四）盲啞敎育的普及問題</h3>
<p>黃警頑：剛才討論過盲啞敎育的合組，現在再談普及問題，二者似乎互相抵觸，其實是殊途同歸，前者着重賀的培養，後者着重量的推廣。我國盲啞人數，向無確實統計，但因傳統與環境的關係，盲啞敎育尚未普遍，故普及盲啞敎育有兩點要注意：（一）要宣傳盲啞敎育的意義，打破傳統的威見，使社會上的人，不將盲啞子弟，當作廢物。（二）應救濟失學或無力的盲啞兒童，如助學金運動，和街頭盲啞兒童的救濟等等，請諸位發表。</p>
<p>宋鵬程：這一點和經濟是不能分開的，我們希望有充裕的經濟力量，然後才能談到盲啞敎育的普及。</p>
<p>汪鏡淵：目前可能做到的，在乎給社會一個啓示，就是盲啞的人當中，是有很多天才的，父母應該給他們敎育的機會，發展他們特殊的能力。現在許多富家的商啞子弟，他們的家長，因了傳統觀念的縛束，僅使他們溫飽終日，這實在是盲啞敎育的一重障碍，要請與論界敎育界加以宣傳，掃除這種成見。</p>
<p>何子健：盲啞的天才，在歷史上有很多的例舉，如貝多芬，荷馬等，即就我國而論，留學生中聲啞的也很多呀！</p>
<p>施殿淸：各校應設免費額。</p>
<p>李定淸：也有許多學校校董會，特設獎學金額的。</p>
<p>汪鏡淵：同時希望申新二報的助學貸學金，對於盲啞失學兒童，予以特別辦法。</p>
<p>何子健：關於救濟街童，本校就盡很大的力量，內中百分之九十八的兒童，是免費敎養，包括衣食住與管理各方面的。</p>
<p>汪鏡淵：這一點應得兒童保障科的聯絡。</p>
<p>張淸根：我們盼望盲啞協會，將來對這一點有一點供獻。</p>
<p>黃警頑：敎育的目的，在養成能够立身社會的健全分子，盲啞敎育也不外乎此，所以盲啞學校的職業訓練，實較其他各點均　緊得多。</p>
<p>汪鏡淵：盲啞的人，因爲少　少聞，知識能力，普遍說起來，進步較緩。但若使之從事某種技術，反能安心定神，比平常人有更大的效率，許多不必利用耳目口音的工作，如木匠，理髮等，均爲盲啞者良好的出路。</p>
<p>何子健：凡不必用眼的職業，盲人都可擔任，本校也設特料訓練，如籐工，打字，編織等，有文學造詣的人，擔任秘書職務的也有。</p>
<p>汪鏡淵：本校歷屆畢業學生三百多人，服務社會，有相當職業，能够勝任偷快的，約有百分之六十，升學及專攻藝術的，約有百分之三十。戰前在商務，中華，世界各書局印刷所服務者不少，尤以在雕塑名家江小　處服務者人數最多，現服務於中華電影聯合公司佈景部，攝影部，及各廣吿社銀行者，人數亦夥。此外更希望社會對聾啞者寄以同情，與以就業機會。</p>
<p>何子健：本校於開辦時，即已設立縫紉與編結二科，後來陸續添設籐工，蘆簾，竹工，結網，木工，紡織各科，最多時容納盲工三十餘人，現因原料缺乏，不得已停頓，還有盲工十餘人，希望工商界僱用。</p>
<p>黃警頑：如諸先生所言，可見各校在艱苦環境中苦幹之成績，尚望繼續努力，造福聾啞，今天承各位發抒高見，復承李女士擔任翻譯，使上海罕有之無音座談會，順利進行，本報謹向諸位道謝。（完）</p>

        <h1>1944.11.10</h1>
<h3>New Japanese Elite Troops Fiercely Attack, Battle Unfolds on Leyte, Enemy Airfield on Morotai Sliced in Two</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – On Leyte Island, Japanese defending forces are currently engaged in fierce battles with approximately five enemy divisions in the western highlands of places like Buloen, Tagame, and Aaro (northwest of Tagame), inflicting significant damage and awaiting an opportunity for a counterattack. This month, the enemy's strong 24th Division infiltrated Manaribanaas (12 kilometers west of Carigara on the north coast of Leyte Island) and is determined to advance towards Carigara. Advancing westward along the south coast, they are currently facing fierce attacks from newly arrived Japanese elite troops near the southwest corner of this bay. Enemy forces in this area are primarily adopting a defensive posture. Some units have been routed due to skillful Japanese operations. However, the enemy has already reorganized and is using the airfields of Tacloban, Talac, Sambabro, and Buloen, attempting to deploy large aircraft. Japanese air units are currently bombing enemy airfields day and night. On the other hand, enemy forces on Morotai Island have occupied the southern coast and part of the northern coast, building an airfield at Kila Point as a relay base for Leyte Island. The Japanese forces on the island are bombing with unpredictable tactics, splitting the enemy airfield into east and west sections in mid-October. On October 22nd, they launched a surprise attack on the enemy position at Bilaao, annihilating 200 enemy soldiers. The enemy, fearing the Japanese army's relentless day and night suicide attacks, has shortened its battle lines. Japanese raiding parties appear and disappear at the enemy airfield, rendering it unusable. Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – German naval commentator Admiral Salwebieter has commented on the fierce Japanese attacks and American weaknesses in the Philippine naval and air battles as follows: Among all the major battles, the Philippine Sea battle is the most noteworthy in the world. The Japanese military's war against the American fleet, transport convoys, and supply lines in Leyte Gulf, based on currently available reports, has achieved new successes. Various types of Japanese naval units have achieved outstanding successes. Japanese aerial bombing units are attacking American ships and transport convoys in Leyte Gulf day and night. The American fleet is currently staying in Leyte Gulf to protect the landing forces and supply them. Although this American fleet has suffered significant damage, it is still forced to remain in Leyte Gulf. Japanese torpedo boat units are attacking American supply convoys, sinking many transport ships. Japanese attacks on American supply lines are mainly carried out by light fleets. Fortunately, the American military currently lacks secure air bases, and its offensive power relies entirely on easily attacked aircraft carriers, making it impossible to achieve a stable position in the short term. In particular, the anchorage of the fleet cannot be fully protected against submarine and torpedo boat attacks with mines. The American military has considerable experience in quickly establishing air bases. The Japanese military urgently needs to consider countermeasures.</p>
<p>General Yamashita's Inaugural Address, Philippines, 9th (Central News Agency) – General Yamashita Tomoyuki met with the press corps for the first time on the 8th, delivering a confident address on the war situation: "Recently, we inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy's large mobile unit in the waters off Taiwan. Subsequently, in the waters east of the Philippines, Leyte Gulf, east of Saipan, and the Morotai area, the Japanese army and navy air forces and navy have all achieved victories. I am extremely pleased about this. These victories are all based on the Japanese tradition of sacrifice, with a small number of troops and machines. All Japanese people can embrace this spirit of sacrifice to face the national crisis, and I am confident that we can seize the opportunity to win. We are all currently undertaking our missions with this spirit. In the past, in the larger islands of the Pacific, Japanese troops were fired upon from all directions by enemy warships and bombed by enemy aircraft. Japanese soldiers were able to sacrifice themselves in this isolated and helpless situation, fighting with a few against many until they were all killed in battle. I can only express my heartfelt sympathy and respect for this. I will strive to fully develop our combat power in the future. Although the Philippines is called an island nation, we must never allow the enemy to freely enter and exit this vast area as they have in the past. The Philippines has been ravaged by foreigners in the past, and its several attempts at independence have failed. Their feelings of pain and anger are understandable. Statues of Rizal are visible everywhere in the Philippines. I deeply admire the patriotic youth and am pleased that there are now many like Rizal in the Philippines. Although the Philippines has only been independent for a year, we are willing to do our best to support its development to the extent possible. The unscrupulous United States intends to obliterate the independence of the Philippines, using a large number of battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers to infringe upon the security of the Philippines. However, we are determined to protect the independence of the Philippines with our lives and enable the Philippines to step onto the world stage and complete our mission."</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Tominaga's Reflections, Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tominaga, the new commander of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Philippines, expressed his reflections on his unwavering beliefs on the afternoon of the 8th: "I have received a great mission this time, commanding the frontline air force, and I swear to persevere to the end with a firm determination to face difficulties. I also believe that the national fortune of the divine nation of Japan will last forever, and we can win the final victory. I am immensely honored to share weal and woe and carry out great justice with the brave soldiers who wholeheartedly serve the country."</p>
<h3>Japanese Art and Handicrafts to be Exhibited in China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japan Art and Craft Control Association and the Japan Trading Association, with the support of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, will hold Japanese art and craft exhibitions in Beijing and Shanghai in late November and early December, respectively. It is hoped that these craft works will introduce the true face of Japan under wartime conditions to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. These works are representative pieces from the "Exhibition" held in Tokyo in May this year, including art and craft works and industrial craft works by famous painters and sculptors. After the exhibition in Shanghai, it is also planned to hold exhibitions in Nanjing and other places.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Information Bureau, in view of the significant victories achieved by the Japanese army and navy in the sea battles off Taiwan, the sea battles off the Philippines, and the air and sea battles of Leyte Gulf since October 12, has compiled a summary of the war results. As of November 2, the confirmed war results include the sinking of more than 88 enemy ships and the damaging of 121 ships, for a total of 209 ships sunk or destroyed. A detailed breakdown by time and area is as follows:</p>
<p>Air Combat Results off Taiwan</p>
<p>October 12: Sinking of 4 aircraft carriers, damaging of 1 aircraft carrier, 11 ships of unknown type. October 13: Sinking of 3 aircraft carriers, 1 cruiser or destroyer, damaging of 1 aircraft carrier, 1 battleship, 1 cruiser, 7 places struck and on fire.

<p>Guiyang, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the Japanese army base outside Guilin City: The Japanese army attacking Guilin broke into Guilin City on the 9th.

At 0:10 AM on the 9th, they successfully crossed the river for the first time and broke into the city. The breakthrough point was in the area between Fubo Mountain and the East Gate on the east side of the city center. The river was 200 meters wide. The Zhongzheng Bridge connecting the East Gate and the opposite bank had been destroyed by the Chongqing forces. The Japanese troops successfully crossed the river using civilian boats.

Therefore, the Japanese army was facing off against the Chongqing army at a location four kilometers from the outskirts.

<h3>Authorities Actively Planning to Stop Illegal Extortion in Order to Stabilize People's Livelihood and Promote National Policy</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Recently, prices in various places have continued to rise, making people's lives increasingly difficult. Therefore, the government authorities have actively planned countermeasures. If the problem of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies cannot be fundamentally eliminated, then the actual stability of the national economy cannot be expected to develop normally. Not only that, the illegal extortion on the material circulation lines is unlimited and unreasonable. Their acts of forcibly collecting, threatening, and intimidating harm farmers and merchants and indirectly affect the people's efforts to increase production.</p>
<p>Therefore, while all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies should be stopped as soon as possible, it is also necessary to find ways to make these extortionists disappear so that the source of materials is not affected and the people's lives can be stabilized. In this way, not only can the national economy be established, but also the operation of the national policy on increasing production and the gaining of popular support will be smoothly promoted. It is deeply hoped that the government will quickly plan countermeasures to meet the people's expectations.</p>
<h3>News Association Holds Standing Committee Meeting</h3>

Xu Liqiu, the chief standing director, and Jin Weibai, the standing director, arrived in Beijing from Shanghai today to hold a meeting with the standing directors in Beijing.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>重慶的苦悶</h3>
<p>Chongqing is currently facing numerous predicaments in military, political, and diplomatic aspects. It lacks the courage to accept overall peace, yet lacks the strength to continue fighting, truly a dilemma of advance or retreat.</p>
<p>First, regarding military affairs, after successive major defeats in Henan and Hunan, the Japanese army has even penetrated into Guangxi, approaching key points such as Guilin and Liuzhou. The southwestern half of the country is in greater peril. From this point on, the Allied forces will be able to coordinate with the Southern Army in the Vietnam area. This has significant implications for both the war against Chongqing and the operations against Britain and the United States. In particular, the great blow suffered by Chongqing is unimaginable. In the recent decisive battles in Henan, Hunan, and Guangxi, the weaknesses of the Chongqing army were fully exposed. The supposedly elite forces of Tang Enbo and Hu Zongnan were easily defeated in the Longhai Railway campaign. Xue Yue's army, which prided itself on being good at fighting, was also ultimately routed. Although the U.S. provided air support and dispatched generals to participate in the command, they were ultimately unable to reverse the fate of defeat due to the disparity in combat power. Chongqing also hoped that the British army in India and Burma and the U.S. naval and air forces in the Pacific could hold back the Japanese army's advance in mainland China. However, the British army was pinned down by the Japanese army, and the U.S. army suffered successive defeats in Taiwan and the Philippines. Thus, Chongqing's wishful thinking of relying on external forces to relieve its crisis became a bubble.</p>
<p>In the political sphere, the friction between Chongqing and the Communists is increasing unabated. Recently, under U.S. mediation, Chongqing and the Communists held several rounds of negotiations. However, judging from the mutually accusatory talks between Wang Shijie and Lin Zuhan, and the various demands made by the Communist Party to the Chongqing side for the reorganization of the government, it is clear that the relationship between the two sides has not only not improved, but is becoming increasingly serious. Furthermore, other small parties besides the Communist Party are also deeply dissatisfied with Chongqing's dictatorial politics, and are turning to collude with the Communist Party in an attempt to use the Communist Party's strength to restrain dictatorship. As a result, the Communist Party has become even more arrogant and domineering. At the same time, Chongqing's unprofitable war of attrition has led to economic bankruptcy and hardship for the people in various places, which has given the Communists the opportunity to deceive and incite people in various places, further intensifying the Communist Party's power. These factors have a significant impact on Chongqing's political position.</p>
<p>As for diplomacy, it is well known that Chongqing is currently being held hostage by Britain and the United States, especially the U.S. The ambitions of British and American imperialism to control China are endless. Recently, the United States has even gone a step further and demanded the supreme command of the Chongqing army, creating discord in the Chongqing-U.S. relationship. The rift between Chongqing and the U.S., centered on the Stilwell's departure from Chongqing incident, is particularly noteworthy. Chongqing's efforts to please the U.S. are not paying off. The United States, which trumpets democracy, is quite dissatisfied with Chongqing's dictatorial politics, and deeply disappointed with the Chongqing army's weak combat capabilities. Therefore, it has used this as a pretext for the Chongqing army to be commanded by the U.S. The United States wants to use more of China's power at its disposal, so it does not approve of the expansion of the friction between the Nationalists and Communists, and even acts as a mediator. Moreover, it supports Yan'an in certain aspects to suppress Chongqing, which truly puts Chongqing in a situation where it cannot cry out or shout.</p>
<p>Chongqing is trapped in extreme distress in military, political, economic, and diplomatic aspects. If it wants to break out of this difficult situation, it must consider fundamental policy changes. Then, does Chongqing have statesmen with great wisdom and courage!</p>

<h3>Symposium on Blind and Deaf Education (2) (4) The Popularity of Blind and Deaf Education</h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan: We have just discussed the combined group of blind and deaf education, and now we will talk about the issue of popularity. The two seem to contradict each other, but they actually lead to the same goal by different paths. The former focuses on the cultivation of talent, and the latter focuses on the promotion of quantity. There are no accurate statistics on the number of blind and deaf people in our country, but due to traditional and environmental factors, blind and deaf education is not yet widespread. Therefore, there are two points to pay attention to in popularizing blind and deaf education: (1) It is necessary to publicize the significance of blind and deaf education, break traditional prejudices, and prevent people in society from treating blind and deaf children as waste. (2) We should provide relief to blind and deaf children who are out of school or unable to afford it, such as scholarship fund movements and the relief of blind and deaf children on the streets, etc. Please express your opinions.</p>
<p>Song Pengcheng: This point cannot be separated from the economy. We hope to have ample economic strength before we can talk about the popularity of blind and deaf education.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyuan: What can be done at present is to give society an inspiration, that is, there are many geniuses among blind and deaf people. Parents should give them educational opportunities and develop their special abilities. At present, many wealthy families have deaf and dumb children, and their parents, due to the shackles of traditional concepts, only make them warm and full all day long. This is indeed a major obstacle to blind and deaf education. We need to ask the opinion circle and the education circle to publicize and eliminate this prejudice.</p>
<p>He Zijian: There are many historical examples of blind and deaf geniuses, such as Beethoven, Homer, etc. Even in our country, there are many deaf and dumb students studying abroad!</p>
<p>Shi Dianqing: Each school should set up free places.</p>
<p>Li Dingqing: There are also many school boards that have specially set up scholarship amounts.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyuan: At the same time, I hope that the scholarship and loan fund of Shenxin Erbao will provide special measures for blind and deaf children who are out of school.</p>
<p>He Zijian: Regarding the relief of street children, our school has done a great deal of effort, and 98% of the children are raised and educated for free, including food, clothing, housing and management.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyuan: This point should be linked to the Children's Protection Section.</p>
<p>Zhang Qinggen: We hope that the Blind and Deaf Association will make some contribution to this point in the future.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: The purpose of education is to cultivate sound members who can stand in society. Blind and deaf education is no exception. Therefore, the vocational training of blind and deaf schools is more important than other points.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyuan: Because blind and deaf people have less listening and hearing, their knowledge and ability, generally speaking, progress more slowly. However, if they are engaged in a certain skill, they can settle down and concentrate, and have greater efficiency than ordinary people. Many jobs that do not require the use of eyes, ears, mouth and voice, such as carpentry, barbering, etc., are good outlets for blind and deaf people.</p>
<p>He Zijian: Blind people can take on any occupation that does not require the use of eyes. Our school also provides special training, such as rattan work, typing, weaving, etc. People with literary accomplishments also serve as secretaries.</p>
<p>Wang Jingyuan: Among the more than 300 graduates of our school over the years, about 60% of them serve the society, have decent jobs, and are able to cope with them happily, and about 30% of them go on to further education and specialize in art. Before the war, there were many people who worked in various bookstores and printing houses such as the Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World, especially in the studio of the famous sculptor Jiang Xiaquan. At present, there are also many people who work in the set department and photography department of the China Film United Company and in various advertising agencies and banks. In addition, I hope that society will sympathize with the deaf and dumb and give them employment opportunities.</p>
<p>He Zijian: When our school was opened, we established sewing and knitting departments. Later, we successively added rattan, reed curtain, bamboo, net knitting, woodworking, and textile departments. At most, we accommodated more than 30 blind workers. Now, due to lack of raw materials, we have to stop. There are still more than 10 blind workers. We hope that the industrial and commercial circles will employ them.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: As the gentlemen said, we can see the achievements of the schools in working hard in difficult environments. I hope that you will continue to work hard to benefit the deaf and dumb. Thank you for your insights today, and thank Ms. Li for translating, so that Shanghai's rare silent symposium was conducted smoothly. The newspaper hereby thanks you all. (End)</p>
