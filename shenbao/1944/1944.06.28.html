<h3 id="c1">代論　虹橋路上半日觀感　與絡繹不絕的米販談話 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>市政諮詢委員會成立以後，對於市政，尤其關於市民生活的問題，極為注意。本市的食糧問題，自始就為諮詢委員會所最加注意。經數回討論後，向政府提出建讓方案。可是，引為遺憾的，最近一月間，米糧問題形成了普遍的嚴重局面。諮詢委員會同人為明瞭滬市近郊米糧來源情形，以及沿途有何障礙？約同市府派員實地觀察。昨日由諮詢委員會制定陳日平，項康原兩先生　本人等三人，約同市府指派沈參事觀準，盧專員祺文，一行五人，於廿七日下午二時從申報社出發，以虹橋飛機塲為終點，路經陳家橋米糧集散地點。回程並至徐家匯一帶。沿途所見，以脚踏車載米販遝者居大多數，同人隨時下車，與憇息道旁之販米鄕人接談，先後共談六次。所作問答約如下舉：　問：米從何處販來？買價若干？答：從靑浦販來，今日邁進價每斗八百八九十元，每擔賺三四百元。　問：路上有何障礙？有否勒索？答：最近四五天來，障礙減少。素錢者亦减少。惟靑浦縣屬的警察及保安隊等每斗索取香烟錢五元至十元，需索時態度客氣，並申言因薪餉泰小，請予幫忙等話。但亦有不索錢者。（言下頗為喜形於色）　問：過去勒索情形如何？答：一千每斗需索十五元至二十元，但態度非常强項。　問：淸浦的米從何儲運來？向靑浦買米從何處買？答：靑浦的米大都從朱家角來。向靑浦買米，有得從米店買，有的從香煙店買四為香煙店現在也兼營米糧），有的從住戶買。　問：上面往淸浦買米德人多否？答：坐車的一天有晨午兩班。同時有一千數百輛腳踏車販運。</p>
<p>從上面的問答裏，可以證明最近市府對於疏通米源，禁止勒索，取締障礙，已經見效因此，我們認為米價依然昂貴，是因產米區域的昂貴，　而推想到　地必有囤戶操縱。因為過去農民種植成本，至多不致超過每石二三千元。過去的收買價格固然不合理，而現在的飛漲更不合理。我們認為癓結所在，是產地囤戶先知政府卽將變更採辦方法，在變更以後，拚命拉抬，獲暴利。</p>
<p>諮詢委員會同人，油漆李贊候項康兩先生，竭力主張政府在變更方法以前，產地米價必須限價，但限價不妨較高，一方面有計劃的採辦，決不能放任競買。但當局並未重視這兩點，致有目前的流弊。</p>
<p>其次，我們對於絡繹於途的負販相民，汗流浹背，博取石米三四百元的薄利者，非常感動，他們都是接濟上海民食的功臣。朱柏應說：「一粥一飯，當思來處不易。」白香山詩：「安知盤中栗，粒粒皆辛苦。」試問在上海享受高等娛樂者，曾否想到接濟民食的功臣如何辛苦啊！我們在虹橋路歸途中，遇見滬字五八一五號警察正在搜查一個米販的負米，據他說是搜查私貨，據我們觀察這個米販是十足的鄉民，不會帶私貨的，經他一下阻止，非多流兩身汗不可，我們感到非常憐憫，未知警察當局是否命他搜查米販？</p>
<p>我們希望巿府從速實現新的合理的配給辦法，從速舉辦平　工作，以救濟一部分的民食。可是，民食問題是整個的，決不是局部或一地的努力措施，即可獲得成效。必須由中央規定整個計劃，而由省巿當局與縣地方常局盡力協助推行，才能收效。譬如本巿雖能取締勒索，而產地不能平抑米價，結果本市米價決不會下跌的。同時，我們前已提出建議，中央應速組織民生視察團，希望巿府也考慮組織，相信對於民生問題之解決，必有若干脾胃助。</p>
<p>最後值得附帶提出的，我們在歸途中，經過虹橋路四維化學農園，順便參觀，該園雇用洪牙利籍技師，用黃沙與藥水種植蕃茄，而不需泥土，蕃茄無子，色味均佳。據稱將以同樣方法栽植熱帶植物如菠蘿蜜香蕪西瓜恾果等果物，不久即可出產。我覺得投資創辦此種有益民生的實業，比較開設股票公司企業公司之類，着實有意義得多了。</p>

<h3 id="c5">各統制會　重要人員 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電行政院為適應戰時體制，改善統制機構起見，特將商業統制組織機構加以調整，二十七日行政院會議，已通過社商統會之下分設五統制委員會，分別辦理物資統制事宜，至各統制委員會主任委員人選曁商統會新任理事等，亦經決定，茲將重要人員名單探誌如下：全國商業統制總會理事長聞蘭亭，監事長唐　民，理事吳震修，袁履登，林康侯，江上達，葉扶宵，許冠羣，李祖範，陳水鯉，　侶靑，李澤，孫仲立，蔡聲白，丁厚卿（以上各理事通任一年），陳子　，羅訥齊（以上各理事係新任）。監事周作民，郭　，　　卿，盧志　，黃江泉（以上各監事連任一年）。棉業統制委員會主任委員聞蘭亭（兼任），米糧統制委員會呈任委員袁履登（袁主任委員因病，准給假三月，並派陳國權代行米統會事務曁負責調整該會機構及人事）。粉麥統制委員會王任委員孫仲立。油糧統制委員會主任委員陳子彝。日用品統制委員會主任委負羅訥齋</p>

<p>正我武　同志奮發有為，枕戈待旦之時。此次畢業回防，務應各就木位，分盡責任，一心」德，共同奮鬥，以完遂最後勝利。我們努力重點，不外三方面，政治方面雍正思想，經濟方面增加生產，軍事方面確保治安，我們努力和平區域的　正思想，增加生產，確保治安目的，是在　固和平區域，擴展和平區域，以實現全面和平。因為渝共勢力旣完全為英美蘇的傀儡，換言之即不啻英美蘇的勢力，渝共區域亦即不啻敵人的區域，我們擴展和平區域，實現全面和平，即不啻恢復陷落的地區，消滅敵人的勢力，所以我們的工作將來似屬後方，意義實同前綫。並且和　區域治安確保，和平區域擴展，全面和平實現，逐步可以减少盟軍後顧之憂，將駐在中國的部隊遞次開往前方，增大戰力，太平洋上戰爭的勝利，必能態益確保，而愈早完成，這樣不啻我們在太平洋上與盟邦戰士</p>
<p>駢肩作戰。三重點工作固應同等重要，同時努力確保治安尤為根本，因為治安不能確保，匪共滋衍，民生不寗，則肅正思想，增加生產不能實現，唯有治安確保，而後匪共方能消減，民生方得樂業，思想庸正，生產增加方克完成。所以我們對於確保治安的根本重要工作，尤須特別戮力，諸君智勇兼長，時代鬥士，不甘受壓迫，不願作奴隸，夙具決心，回隊之後，務必時時憂念國家前途之艱鉅，本身責任之重大，智深勇　，刻苦奮勵，對士卒要　甘共苦，對民衆要時加　護，勿為淵驅魚，勿為　驅雀，犧牲一切，報效國家，以蔪大東亞戰爭最後勝利的早日獲得，東亞民族解放的早日得到，</p>

<p>柏林二十七日中央社電海通社軍事訪員塞托留斯稱，瑟堡爭奪戰將吿結束，德守軍殘餘部隊現雖尙在各點作英勇之抵抗，惟在敵衆我寡之局勢下，此役結果業已判然。英美軍行將獲勝，不容否認，但敵軍佔領瑟堡，是否　正的利則尚成問題。首應指出者，佔領瑟堡城，敵軍仍不能利用港口，德軍於美軍進入該城以前，已將港口設施澈底破壞，敵軍方面固有修理準備，惟要塞之一部份尙在德軍手中，其砲口適對港口，故開始修理工作，須待各砲台完全被佔領後。而減低敵軍勝利之價値之另一原因，當為參加瑟堡戰事之美軍，較原定數量超過四倍至五倍之多，敵軍即能於最短之期間立即補充各師缺額，惟此龐大軍隊集中於此狹小區域內，欲繼續向南推進，頗費時日，況前途被阻於德軍堅強之陣地，必須首先予以佔領，故以後數日內蒙高茂萊將軍部下深入諾曼第之企岡，殊難獲得美軍第一軍之合作。英軍第二軍目前暫以本部軍險，於星期日晨在蒂萊區發動進攻，於重創之餘，得佔領蒂萊殘墟，並滲入德軍陣地約一公里，惟缺口不久即吿塡平，敵方業已調到生力軍助戰，故大戰仍在激烈進行中。英電進攻之最初目的，在沿柯蒙至克恩間之公路實施突破，其戰綫最闊處達六公里，現有擴大至隣近區域之徵，此項攻勢或將發展為敵軍向內地推進之大攻勢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Editorial: Impressions of a Half-Day on Hongqiao Road - Conversations with Endless Rice Vendors <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it has paid close attention to municipal affairs, especially issues related to the lives of citizens. The city's food supply problem has been the most important issue for the Advisory Committee from the beginning. After several discussions, it submitted proposals to the government. However, it is regrettable that in the past month, the rice supply problem has become widespread and severe. In order to understand the source of rice in the suburbs of Shanghai and any obstacles along the way, members of the Advisory Committee invited representatives from the municipal government to conduct on-the-spot observations. Yesterday, Mr. Chen Riping, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan, and myself, along with Mr. Shen Guanzhun, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and Mr. Lu Qiwen, Special Commissioner, a group of five people, set off from the Shen Bao newspaper office at 2:00 PM on the 27th, with Hongqiao Airport as the destination, passing through Chenjiaqiao, a rice distribution center. On the way back, we also went to the Xujiahui area. Along the way, most of the rice vendors transported rice by bicycle. We got out of the car at any time and talked to the rice-selling villagers resting by the roadside, a total of six times. The questions and answers were roughly as follows: Question: Where does the rice come from? What is the purchase price? Answer: It is transported from Qingpu. Today's purchase price is 880 or 890 yuan per dou, and the profit is 300 or 400 yuan per dan. Question: Are there any obstacles on the road? Is there any extortion? Answer: In the past four or five days, the obstacles have been reduced. Extortion has also decreased. However, the police and security teams in Qingpu County extort 5 to 10 yuan per dou for cigarette money. When they demand money, their attitude is polite, and they say that their salaries are too low and ask for help. But there are also those who do not extort money. (The tone of speech was quite joyful) Question: What was the extortion situation in the past? Answer: 15 to 20 yuan was demanded for every 1,000 dou, and the attitude was very aggressive. Question: Where does Qingpu's rice come from? Where do you buy rice in Qingpu? Answer: Most of Qingpu's rice comes from Zhujiajiao. To buy rice in Qingpu, some buy from rice shops, some buy from cigarette shops (because cigarette shops also operate rice), and some buy from households. Question: Are there many people going to Qingpu to buy rice? Answer: There are two shifts of cars a day, morning and afternoon. At the same time, there are one thousand and several hundred bicycles transporting rice.</p>
<p>From the above questions and answers, it can be proven that the municipal government's efforts to dredge the source of rice, prohibit extortion, and eliminate obstacles have been effective. Therefore, we believe that the reason why rice prices are still high is because the price of rice in the producing areas is high. This leads us to suspect that there must be hoarders manipulating the market in the producing areas. Because in the past, the cost of planting for farmers did not exceed 2,000 or 3,000 yuan per shi. The purchase prices in the past were unreasonable, and the current soaring prices are even more unreasonable. We believe that the crux of the problem is that the hoarders in the producing areas knew in advance that the government would change the procurement method. After the change, they desperately pushed up prices and made huge profits.</p>
<p>Members of the Advisory Committee, especially Mr. Li Zanhoushi Xiang Kang, strongly advocated that the government must limit the price of rice in the producing areas before changing the method, but the price limit could be higher. On the one hand, planned procurement is necessary, and competitive bidding should not be allowed. However, the authorities did not pay attention to these two points, resulting in the current abuses.</p>
<p>Secondly, we are very moved by the porters on the road, sweating profusely, earning meager profits of 300 or 400 yuan per stone of rice. They are all meritorious in supplying Shanghai's food. Zhu Baiying said, "When eating a bowl of porridge or rice, we should think of how hard it was to obtain it." Bai Juyi's poem says, "How can you know that every grain in the plate is the result of hard work?" I wonder if those who enjoy high-end entertainment in Shanghai have ever thought about how hard the meritorious people who supply food are! On the way back on Hongqiao Road, we saw police officer No. 5815 from Shanghai searching a rice vendor's rice. According to him, he was searching for smuggled goods. According to our observation, this rice vendor was a complete villager and would not carry smuggled goods. With his obstruction, he had to sweat more. We felt very sorry for him. We don't know if the police authorities ordered him to search rice vendors?</p>
<p>We hope that the municipal government will quickly implement new and reasonable distribution methods and quickly organize price stabilization work to relieve part of the food shortage. However, the food problem is a whole, and it cannot be solved by local or regional efforts alone. The central government must formulate an overall plan, and the provincial and municipal authorities and county local authorities must do their best to assist in its implementation to achieve results. For example, even if this city can eliminate extortion, if the price of rice cannot be stabilized in the producing areas, the price of rice in this city will never fall. At the same time, we have previously suggested that the central government should quickly organize a livelihood inspection team, and we hope that the municipal government will also consider organizing one, believing that it will be of some help in solving the livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that on the way back, we passed by the Siwei Chemical Farm on Hongqiao Road and took the opportunity to visit. The farm hires a Hungarian technician who uses yellow sand and chemicals to grow tomatoes without soil. The tomatoes are seedless and have a good color and taste. It is said that the same method will be used to grow tropical plants such as jackfruit, cherimoya, watermelon, and mangoes, and they will be produced soon. I think investing in and establishing this kind of industry that is beneficial to people's livelihoods is much more meaningful than opening stock companies and business companies.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Adjustment Principles <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th - Regarding the adjustment of the control organization, according to the authorities, it is being carried out based on the following principles: Material control adopts the principle of focusing on key items. Those that are important are strictly controlled, and the control methods are varied depending on the supply and demand situation. Strengthen the Commercial Control Council and its subordinate organizations to promote the spirit of autonomous control and seek closer relationships between the various levels to ensure smooth operation from top to bottom. Strive for harmony between the administrative organizational system and the civil economic organizational system, and maintain consistency between central and local administrative organizations. Clearly delineate the scope of authority between central and local organizations and between government and commercial groups to clarify responsibilities. Avoid interference and friction between Chinese and Japanese civil economic organizations to promote normal activities.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Key Points of Improvement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>As for the key points of improvement, they can be summarized as follows: In terms of organization, this adjustment clearly delineates the functions and powers of the relevant agencies. For example, the Material Control Review Committee is an advisory body to the Executive Yuan, responsible for reviewing important economic policies. The National General Commercial Control Council is responsible for connecting and coordinating the lower-level organizations and supervising and guiding them. The Rice and Grain, Cotton, Flour and Wheat, Oil and Grain, and Daily Necessities Control Committees are responsible for implementing their respective businesses. The system is clear and there is no overlap. The Material Control Review Committee has also established a Standing Committee to assist the Chairman in handling daily affairs, simplifying the organization and improving the efficiency of control. In terms of personnel, in addition to key personnel from relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies and the financial and industrial sectors, the members of the Material Control Review Committee also include representatives from various provinces and special municipalities, integrating the opinions of the central government, local governments, and relevant parties. The directors and supervisors of the Commercial Control Council and the chairmen of the various control committees are all leaders who are highly respected and familiar with the industry. The government has high expectations for the progress of future control efforts.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Other Materials <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Regarding materials outside the control of the Control Committee, such as wool, leather, cigarettes, and tobacco leaves, the competent authorities will formulate management measures separately, taking into account the needs of the times, the urgency of the situation, and the degree of importance, so that these important materials can also be reasonably controlled. Other matters, such as the relationship between Chinese and Japanese commercial groups and the system of Chinese commercial groups, will also be rationally adjusted by the relevant parties to further improve the entire economic control mechanism. Continue to carry out various activities, separately eliminate the counterattacks from the Chongqing army from land, sea, and air, and remove any obstacles and invite US aircraft to remove the mines blocking waterways, etc. At the same time, suppress the Dongting Lake water city and bravely advance, making the land forces' combat favorable progress.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th - The Japanese army in Henan began attacking the area along the new Yellow River east of the Beijing-Hankou Railway, the territory of the Chongqing army's Fan Dong Tingshen Army (Commander Chen Yixin), numbering about 20,000, on the night of the 16th.

<p>The entire East Asian</p>
<p>nation, the entire Chinese nation's great East Asian War for survival is now entering the final decisive stage. At the beginning of the war, the Allied forces used the power of a thunderbolt to destroy the enemy's century-old power in East Asia in the blink of an eye. The foundation for victory has already been laid. For two years, the enemy's remaining forces have been gradually cleared, and the prospect of victory has become brighter. As long as we continue our efforts, we will definitely achieve complete victory. However, the ambition of Britain and the United States to invade and enslave East Asia, driven by greed, is still desperate, vainly trying to revive. Therefore, the Allied forces and we cannot but strive for the final five minutes, killing the enemy in front and achieving the results, consolidating security in the rear, expanding the peaceful area, and fully realizing complete peace. All of you are selected from among the generals, the pillars of the country. Now you have come to the Corps for further education as active-duty officers. Your role in reorganizing and building the army is extremely important and significant, especially at this last crucial moment of the East Asian nation's and the Chinese nation's survival.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Critical Moment <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>It is the time for us to demonstrate our martial spirit and be diligent and enterprising, awaiting orders at all times. Upon returning to your posts after graduation, you must fulfill your responsibilities in your respective positions, working with one heart and one mind to complete the final victory. Our efforts focus on three aspects: politically, rectifying thought; economically, increasing production; and militarily, ensuring security. Our efforts to rectify thought, increase production, and ensure security in the peaceful area are aimed at consolidating the peaceful area, expanding the peaceful area, and realizing complete peace. Because the Chongqing Communist forces are completely puppets of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, in other words, they are the forces of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the Chongqing Communist area is also the enemy's area. Our expansion of the peaceful area and the realization of complete peace are equivalent to recovering the fallen areas and eliminating the enemy's forces. Therefore, although our work may seem to be in the rear in the future, its significance is the same as that of the front line. Moreover, ensuring security in the peaceful area, expanding the peaceful area, and realizing complete peace can gradually reduce the Allied forces' worries in the rear, allowing them to successively deploy the troops stationed in China to the front lines, increasing their combat power. The victory in the Pacific War will be more assured and will be completed sooner. This is equivalent to our soldiers fighting shoulder to shoulder with the Allied forces in the Pacific. While the three key tasks should be equally important, at the same time, efforts to ensure security are particularly fundamental, because if security cannot be ensured, the Communist bandits will breed, and the people's livelihood will not be peaceful. Then, rectifying thought and increasing production cannot be realized. Only when security is ensured can the Communist bandits be eliminated, the people can live and work in peace, and the rectification of thought and the increase in production can be completed. Therefore, we must devote special efforts to the fundamental and important task of ensuring security. All of you are intelligent and brave, warriors of the era, unwilling to be oppressed, unwilling to be slaves, and have long had the determination. After returning to your teams, you must always worry about the difficulties of the country's future and the importance of your own responsibilities. Be wise and brave, work hard and diligently, share weal and woe with the soldiers, and protect the people. Do not drive fish into the deep, do not drive birds into the thicket. Sacrifice everything to serve the country, so that the final victory of the Great East Asian War can be achieved sooner, and the liberation of the East Asian nations can be achieved sooner.</p>

<p>The completion of autonomy and revival is what this Chairman has high hopes for. Furthermore, your training period in the Corps was very short, and the equipment in the Corps was limited by funding. However, now that you have achieved such results, I would like to express my deep gratitude to the efforts of all the faculty, staff, and advisors.</p>
<h3 id="e16">German Troops in Normandy Fight Valiantly to Prevent Enemy from Penetrating Inland, British Elite Forces Reinforce Tilley Area <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - Haintong News Agency military correspondent Sertorius stated that the battle for Cherbourg is coming to an end. Although the remaining German defending forces are still heroically resisting at various points, the outcome of this battle is already clear under the circumstances of the enemy being numerous and we being few. It is undeniable that the Anglo-American forces will win, but whether the enemy's occupation of Cherbourg is a real gain is still questionable. The first thing to point out is that even if the enemy occupies Cherbourg, they still cannot use the port. Before the American troops entered the city, the German troops had thoroughly destroyed the port facilities. The enemy has repair preparations, but part of the fortress is still in the hands of the German troops, and their cannons are facing the port, so the repair work must wait until all the forts have been completely occupied. Another reason to reduce the value of the enemy's victory is that the American troops participating in the Battle of Cherbourg exceeded the original number by four to five times. The enemy can immediately replenish the vacancies in the various divisions in the shortest possible time, but it will take time for this huge army to concentrate in this small area to continue to advance south. Moreover, the road ahead is blocked by the strong German positions, which must be occupied first. Therefore, it will be difficult for General Montgomery's troops to penetrate Normandy in the next few days to obtain the cooperation of the American First Army. The British Second Army is currently temporarily using its own troops to launch an offensive in the Tilley area on Sunday morning. After heavy damage, they managed to occupy the ruins of Tilley and penetrated the German positions by about one kilometer, but the gap was soon filled. The enemy has transferred new forces to help in the battle, so the great battle is still going on fiercely. The initial goal of the British offensive was to break through along the highway between Caumont and Caen. The widest part of the front line reached six kilometers, and there are signs of expanding to neighboring areas. This offensive may develop into a major offensive by the enemy to advance inland.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - The German authorities announced on the 26th that the German defense commander in Cherbourg has rejected the American troops' surrender advice. The German troops in the area are determined to continue defending to the end, and are engaging in fierce bayonet fighting with the anti-Axis forces, desperately defending the various fortresses, but thousands of German troops have been overwhelmed by the superior forces of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - On the night of the 25th, the Cherbourg fortress was cut off from external communications. The German garrison in the former Cherbourg fortress issued its last radio report, saying, "The German Cherbourg garrison is now united in continuing the final desperate battle. Long live Führer Hitler, long live Germany."</p>

<p>Forward Lines, 17th - Central News Agency via Huitong News Agency Naval Correspondent Dennis, filed a report a few hours after leaving Cherbourg, stating: As the war extended to the suburbs of the city, every position, every machine gun nest, or individual stronghold was fiercely contested. The German army completely destroyed the remaining port facilities of Cherbourg. The last few hours of hard struggle defy description. The German army held on to every square foot of land, exacting the greatest effort from the enemy and inflicting the greatest losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th - Central News Agency via German News Agency: Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in Italy between the Tyrrhenian Sea and Lake Trasimeno.

<p>Berlin, 27th - Central News Agency via German News Agency, according to an official German announcement: The valiant German forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front, in the areas of Babruysk, Mogilev, and Osipovichi, are engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles with six enemy armies. West and northwest of Vitebsk, German forces are currently fighting fiercely, retreating to new positions. East of Polotsk, Soviet forces launched an attack under tank cover but were repulsed.</p>

The Soviet army is attempting a pincer encirclement in the Vitebsk area, and fierce battles are ongoing. Near Smolensk, the Soviet army lost 175 tanks, and on the Western Dvina front, they lost 70.

<h3 id="e21">Rice from Various Regions Continuously Transported to Shanghai - Supply and Demand Can Be Balanced - Difficulties and Extortion Along the Way Affect Rice Prices in This City <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The rice supply in this city has been well managed by the government authorities, with close cooperation between officials and merchants. The daily arrivals have been relatively smooth, and rice prices have fallen below nine dollars. Rice merchants are procuring rice from various regions, applying for permits, with an average quantity of about 20,000 dan per day. Rice purchased from Wuhu, Changzhou, Kunshan, Taizhou, and other places has been arriving in Shanghai successively. The number of temporary transport permits applied for by citizens is over 1,000 shi per day. Those transporting from Qingpu, Zhujiajiao, Songjiang, and other producing areas are continuously on the road. Based on the above applications and the amount of rice being transported, supply and demand can be considered roughly equivalent. According to the current situation, calculating the cost of rice from the producing areas, plus transportation costs and legitimate profits, the price in the city should be able to return to normal. However, it has not yet returned to the right track. The main reason is that there are still difficulties and extortion along the way.</p>
<p>Reports from Rice Purchasing Merchants In recent days, rice merchants who have registered to purchase rice have reported that a certain county on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has prohibited the export of rice and has arbitrarily established trade associations. A certain location on the Shanghai-Nanjing line is said to be charging a handling fee of 50 yuan per dan to a certain rice store holding Shanghai Rice Permit No. 1099. It is also rumored that citizens in a certain county holding Temporary Rice Transport Permit No. 699 from the Rice and Grain Control Committee were obstructed from transporting rice in that area and were restricted to selling it locally. Furthermore, merchants in a certain county holding Permits Nos. 592, 593, 272, and 185 were obstructed in a certain location. They had to pay 500 yuan per shi of rice to be allowed to proceed. Although these facts have not been personally witnessed, these rumors are definitely not without cause. Evidence from the Food Administration authorities shows that the daily correspondence and files regarding these matters are numerous, and a general understanding can already be gleaned. Regarding the ban on rice exports in various regions, the reporter once interviewed the Rice and Grain Control Committee.</p>
<p>Will Request Sanctions from Authorities According to the spokesperson of the Committee: "This Committee is the national rice and grain control agency. We treat the food supply of the entire country equally and handle it uniformly. The permits and certificates we issue allow the transport of rice from producing areas, taking into account the local consumption quantity, and only allow transport of the surplus to regulate the food supply in Nanjing and Shanghai. Therefore, there is no impact on the local food supply. The Executive Yuan has already issued an order to the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, instructing all counties and districts under their jurisdiction not to obstruct the transport of rice. Therefore, arbitrarily banning the export of rice is a violation of regulations, and arbitrarily establishing trade associations is also illegal." It is slightly opened for relevant parties to dispatch secret agents, disguised as rice merchants, to go to various places to investigate the truth and to photograph the acts of obstruction and extortion, in order to present them to the highest authorities for severe sanctions. It is generally believed that if these extortionists are not severely punished, it will not be enough to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>The battle situation in the Mariana Islands is becoming increasingly fierce. Minister Matsushima, Fleet Spokesman stationed in China, gave a statement yesterday stating: The decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Mariana Islands is still continuing fiercely. The enemy is desperately trying to capture Saipan and is also making a sudden attack on Iwo Jima, between Japan and Saipan, in an attempt to cut off Japan's supply line to the Mariana Islands. However, the Japanese garrison on Saipan and the garrisons in the Volcano Islands are fighting bravely, causing the enemy to be exhausted. The enemy is currently losing everything in their attempt to capture Saipan. In other words, due to the skillful operations of the Japanese army, the enemy is losing their valuable warships and aircraft carriers every day. Japanese aircraft are continuously active in the inner South Seas islands such as Truk and Palau, as well as in the Philippines and other places. Wherever there are airfield facilities, there are traces of Japanese aircraft, and no enemy land-based air force can organize a strong formation. Therefore, Japan is currently in the most advantageous situation to destroy the enemy fleet. Once the Japanese fleet has grasped air supremacy and carries out a decisive battle, the American forces will become increasingly disadvantaged, but the Japanese army's operations will become increasingly advantageous. To protect the capital of tens of thousands of people on Saipan, the United States will lose all of its principal and interest. This is only a matter of time, and we can wait and see.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Wheat Flour Control Committee Confirms Collection and Distribution Plan <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Business Control Committee's Wheat Flour Control Committee, the internal structure is planned to be changed to one office, three divisions, and ten sections, which are currently being adjusted. The committee has decided on the steps to implement the wheat flour control plan and has drafted four interim plans for wheat flour purchase, wheat flour distribution, processing and manufacturing, and movement control. These plans have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and they will be announced and implemented once approved. It is understood that the committee's new control plan is more advanced and improved than the past, and its strengthening focus is on: Wheat flour self-manufacturing, that is, the wheat purchased by designated purchasing merchants, agents, and grain stores is directly entrusted to local flour mills to grind flour and bran. The purchase price of wheat is based on the standard of allowing farmers to survive, and a fair and reasonable price is set for purchase. Stipulating strict measures for movement control to prevent smuggling and corruption.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Tragic Ferry Overturn Accident at Gao Miao Pier <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Over Ten Male and Female Passengers Drowned In the Huangpu River at the Gao Miao Pier, i.e., Qingning Temple in Pudong, a ferry overturned at 6:30 AM on the morning of the 26th, resulting in the tragic drowning of over ten passengers. Details obtained from the relevant authorities are as follows: The owner of the overturned boat, Shen Huixiang, a Chongming native, is 43 years old and makes a living by rowing boats. He owns a two-ton wooden boat and specializes in ferrying workers from the Yufeng Yarn Factory at the pier, but he has not obtained a Huangpu River permit from the Public Utilities Bureau and has not joined the Ferry Industry Association. At 6:30 AM on the morning of the incident, he was loading workers at the Qingning Temple pier to cross the river. However, the boat had not yet stopped properly, and the workers rushed to board, becoming very crowded. Shen Huixiang was deeply concerned that there would be an accident due to the excessive number of people, and he hastily rowed the boat away from the pier. Unexpectedly, the boarding workers had exceeded the load capacity, and they had not yet sat down, causing the boat to lose its balance. Coupled with the fact that it was high tide and the current was very strong, the boat overturned, causing a major tragedy. Police officers Liu Chunhua and Han Fengming from the water patrol team led small boats to rescue the victims, but the tide was too rapid, and they were unable to rescue them in time. Over ten people sank to the bottom of the river. Mr. Kimura, the owner of the Yufeng Yarn Factory, assisted in the search with boats upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Recovered Corpses After recovering the corpses, they included Qian Genyun, a 24-year-old female living at No. 4 Qianjiawan, Pudong; Xi Zhaodi, a 16-year-old female living at No. 38 Quanjiazhai, Jinjia Song, Pudong; Tao Rongzhen, a 14-year-old female living in Majia Alley, Pudong; Lu Xingeng, 27 years old, living at No. 8 Lujia Lane, Pudong; Ding Xiaomei, a 43-year-old widow living in Dongzuijiao, Pudong; Wu Jinmei, a 16-year-old female living in Dongzuijiao, Pudong, etc. Among them, except for Xi Zhaodi, who was a female worker at the Gongda Yarn Factory, the rest were workers at the Yufeng Yarn Factory. Their families have claimed the bodies for burial. The corpses of Zhuang Yuanmei, Zhang Peizhen, Ma Xiaomei, Liu Xiulan, Ma Genmei, Ma Wenzhen, and others have not yet been recovered. Their families are crying along the riverbank, which is very tragic. After the incident, the boat owner, Shen Huixiang, has been detained by the Water Patrol Headquarters for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Short Commentary - Donate Scrap Metal <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Economic Bureau recently convened a symposium of representatives from various industry associations across the city, presided over by Director Xu of the Economic Bureau, to encourage members of various industry associations to donate scrap metal, hoping that association members would donate as much as possible.</p>
<p>During wartime, in order to jointly strive for victory, the people have the obligation to contribute money, goods, and labor to the country. All belligerent countries are like this. Moreover, we can further understand the future of the country's efforts to achieve victory from the people's emotions regarding the contribution of money, goods, and labor. Therefore, when the country makes demands on the people, the people should do their best to meet them. We are currently in a decisive period, and everyone should pay special attention to this principle.</p>
<p>Voluntarily donating scrap metal is the obligation of the people to contribute goods that the country requires, and the people should do their best to donate. Moreover, scrap metal is merely idle waste in the possession of the people, and at most it is only a part of personal property. However, for the country, it can be used as a raw material for military needs, and even as a raw material for machinery in civilian industries, to manufacture tools for striving for victory and protecting the people's property, and to manufacture tools for manufacturing civilian goods. In individuals, it is a small amount of waste, but in the country, it can be used greatly. Weighing the importance, this is what should be done.</p>
<p>This newspaper is humbly a member of the nation and has already donated 200 jin of scrap iron as an example, hoping that all sectors of society will respond enthusiastically and form a vigorous movement.</p>
