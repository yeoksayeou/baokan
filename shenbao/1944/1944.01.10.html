<p>社評</p>
<h3>論用人</h3>
<p>我們對於國家的政治，衷心只有一個唯一的主張，就是法治。因爲政府守法，國民守法，國家就走上法治的途徑，政治自然也就淸明。可是中華民國三十餘年來，自己創立的法和採用外國的法已經不知有多少，而中華民國依然不是一個法治國。最大的原因，在乎人事，所謂「有治法無治人」，因此我們對於政府用人，不時也有誠懇的請求和希望。近來中樞當局對於用人很加注意，這是中國最樂觀的現象，我們願意再提供幾點「卑之無甚高論」的意見。</p>
<p>裁退冗員。冗員在國家財政上是一個最大的浪費，這是任何人都知道的。但是冗員最大的害處，還不在此。冗員最大的害處是妨礙工作。我們觀察三十餘年來的中國政治，可以斷然地說，凡是多冗員的機關，都做不出像樣的成續。小至一股一科，大至一司一部，都逃不出這個公例。因爲少數人的緊張，少數人的奮鬥，敵不住大多數人的頹唐，大多數人的偷懶。久而久之，可以使緊張的人無從緊張，奮鬥的人無從奮鬥，影響所及，整個的人員是腐化了，整個的機關那有不腐化的道理。冗員發生的原因，大都是安揷私人，或敷衍請託。我們希望當局明白，安挿私人，敷衍請託，不但是浪費公款，更足以妨礙事業的進行，影響整個機關的前途，更足以影饗全國國民對於主持當局的信仰。就冗員本身說，養成了頹惰的習慣，是毀了終身。就請託介紹的人說，誤了一個朋友，更誤了一個機關。就任用冗員的當局說，因爲一個事業的腐敗，失却全國國民的信仰，更葬送了個人整個的前程。所謂「一着之錯，全盤皆失」。希望大家都耍注意。</p>
<p>禮聘幹才。曾國藩說，一國家之强，以得人爲强。」又說，「中興在乎得人」。所謂「人」，就是指一般忠心爲國，脚踏實地，努力工作的幹才。可是幹才不比庸才，更不比那「喚之即來，呼之即去」的奴才。特別在中國，數千年來以儒家思想爲中心，幹才的自尊，成功了社會上傳統的精神。所以幹才的禮聘，成功了社會上最崇高的風尙，更認爲政府當局最偉大的功績。而幹才們應聘之後，不顧一切的奮鬥，甚至於死，更認爲對國家對個人最高上的榮譽。讀過三國演義的（三演義一書影響於國民心理極鉅），都知道劉備的「三顧茅蘆」，更知道諸葛亮的「鞠躬盡瘁」。因爲劉備的「三顧茅蘆」方才能够使諸葛亮一心一意地「鞠躬盡瘁」。「士爲知己者死」，是讀書人的養氣，也是讀書人的志願。在目前的非常環境裏，我們希望金中國的幹才，不要再做諸葛亮的「高臥隆中」，因爲現在已經沒有隆中，更不是高臥的時候。可是我們希望政府當局們，個個都要有「禮賢下士」的精神，個個都要做「求賢若渴」的劉備。</p>
<h3>岸情報部長　廣播演說</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日駐華大使館岸情報部長於九日下午九時廿分，以「國府參戰周年」爲題，發表廣播演講。大意謂國民政府之參戰，完全於自主之立塲，根據難以抑止之內心的要求而發生者，蓋打倒英美，復與中國，保衛東亞，均爲中國革命本來之目的，且與此次大東亞戰爭之共同要求相一致。中國民衆應充分體會大東亞戰爭之意義，及充分理解日本對華新政策之眞意。旅華日僑應以中國爲最能信任之戰友，互相提携，爭取大東亞勝利云。</p>
<h3>我參戰周年紀念　中日滿交換廣播　互相勗勉向共同目標邁進</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　昨九日爲我國參戰週年紀念日，中日滿三國爲共同紀念，特由我國汪院長，日本東條自相·滿洲國張國務總理作交歡廣播。茲錄汪院長廣播詞如後：</p>
<p>汪院長廣播辭猛自鞭策實踐宣言</p>
<p>今日爲中國參加大東亞戰爭一週年紀念之日　吾人具滿腔熱誠，以迎此紀念日，幷决以更大之努力，期於今年之最後决勝有所貢獻，回憶自大東亞戰爭開始以來，英美之侵略勢力，已爲盟邦日本所次第擊碎，而野心未死，狂吠反攻，乃去年一年之間所謂反攻，徒增加其人力物力之消耗，大東亞戰綫毫未爲所搖撼。我於此謹對於盟邦日本海陸軍將士之忠勇堅苦奮鬥犧性之精神，致最大之敬意。盟邦日本不但在軍事上建樹偉勳，同時並謀大東亞各民族之一心一德精誠國結，在政治上經濟上文化上，完成獨立發展共同繁榮之建設。自中日同盟締結後，中日兩國已經重新建立永久友好之基礎，自大東亞宣言發表後，大東亞各國家更獲共同前進一致向上之鵠的，孟子所謂「天時地利人和」三者實已兼備，在今年最後决勝之一年中，大東亞各國家實具有充分之把握與信念。我們從今日起，惟有更加奮發，向肅正思想·保障洽安·增加生產三大要綱猛自鞭策，以期克盡中國之責任，及分担大東亞一份子之義務。關於淪方，吾人曾經多次予以忠告期其反省，無如自所謂開羅會議以來，渝方陷溺愈深，迷途愈遠，誠使吾人十分遺憾。惟我敢决定渝方與英美愈近，則與全國民衆愈遠，因爲渝方最近一切表示，無異明白吿訴全國民衆，渝方已非爲中國而抗戰乃爲英美而抗戰。詳言之，渝方爲滿足英美侵略東亞乃至全世界的野心之故，不惜爲英美之爪牙，導引英美使以中國土地爲飛機轟炸之塲，而且不惜更進一步，使中國人與中國人自相殘殺，並使中國人與東亞人自相殘殺。渝方此　自殘同種的悖逆行爲，定將不容於全國民衆。我們今日惟有本於中日同盟條約及大東亞宣言的精神，協力日本完成大東亞戰爭，以勝利答覆渝方之虛僞宣傳，以建設預備收容渝方崩潰後流離失所之民衆。</p>
<p>日首相廣播辭願盟邦作更大努力</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　目柬條首相廣演播詞，要旨如下：「去歲今日，中華民國國民政府對英美宣戰，同時並宣言協力日方共同完成戰爭，一年以來，國民政府本此實踐對大東亞戰爭·裨益良多，日本政府於茲敬致謝忱。自中國參戰迄今之一年中，就日本方面而觀，曾陸續實施關於交還租界撤廢治外法權之協定，而去歲十月更就中日基本條約作根本改訂，簽定中日同盟條約，而確立中日根本之關係，此不外日本基於　國精神之具體表現，相信由此可達成中日共同之使命，可實現孫文先生之理想。再就全大東亞而觀，去歲八月緬甸首先獨立，十月菲律賓亦行獨立，十一月東亞各國更共同舉行大東亞會議，發表大東亞共同宣言，對全世界表明吾人共同信念，該宜言中五大綱領，實為今後建設東亞之大憲章。於茲中國參戰周年紀念之日，謹向諸君致辭，期與盟邦中國國民抱共同理想，於必勝信念下，向最後勝利之途，作更進一步之努力。</p>
<p>滿總理廣播辭職決意協力完成使命</p>
<p>新京九日中央社電　滿洲國張國務總理　播演詞，要旨如次：際此大東亞戰爭獲得輝煌戰果之秋，又逢中華民國參戰一週年紀念日·衷心自感欣快。回憶中華民國於去年今日對英美宣戰，同時中國與日本之關係，已由同甘共苦進而爲同生共死，余對於中國國民政府此種毅然態度，殊爲敬佩。自中華民國參戰以來，緬甸與菲律賓相繼獨立，南方原住民獲得參政機會，印度臨時政府亦吿成立，足見大東亞各民族均已各得其所，大東亞共榮之基礎，至是已完全確立，大東亞共榮圈之理想即將實現，而吾人必勝不敗之地位亦完全確立，是則堪與我亞洲之同胞所同慶者也。滿洲國於大東亞戰爭勃發後，益感本身責任之重大，爲實踐日滿兩國一心一德共同防衛之大義，余等决邀照皇帝陛下詔示，致力於增强戰力及鎭護北陲，與東亞各盟邦共同向完遂聖戰之途邁進。中日滿三國及東亞各國家各民族須更加緊密團結，抱必勝之信念，克服一切困難，期澈底擊減英美。</p>
<p>井口部長發表談話闡述中日盟約意義</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日情報局第三部長井口氏，八日接見我國記者團發表談話，大意謂：本月九日爲中國參戰一週年紀念日，此不僅在中國歷史上，且在東亞史上，實最足紀念之日，蓋從日本方面而言，去年一月九日，爲日本推進對華新政策開始之日，日本之對華政策，根本目的在協助中國提高國際地位，同時樹立中日兩國緊密之提携協力　係，以謀共存共榮，故日本對華之新政策，於此點上亦無　何變化。但大東亞戰　發動以前，日本不能充分向）此根本目標進，蓋彼時中國有强大之英美勢力存在也，英美利用一切謀略，妨碍中日提携，而日本爲應付英美，有時不得已而趨於此路，故有時中國對日發生誤解，實由此而致。然大束亞戰爭勃發後，英美於中國之勢力被淸除，日　當能充分遂行對華政策，即爲根據日本之道義外交，站在新的基礎之上消除英美勢力。日本在此一年中，即本此旣定方針，着着貫澈新政策，日本之對華新政策至去年十月下旬，中日同盟條約締結後，已達其頂點，余於此願就該條約歷史上之意義加以闡述，藉喚起一般人士之注意。中日同盟條約及附　議定書，實奠定中國統一及近代國家發展之基礎，如當時汪主席所謂中日關係已在東亞開一新紀元矣。至去年十一月初旬舉行大東亞會議，由東亞十億民衆决議建設大東亞共榮圈之基本原則，於此大東亞即現出光輝之黎明。大東亞宣言之基本精神，已在中日盟約中具體表現，中國若處於半殖民之地位，則日本因不能獨立繁榮，若日本戰敗，則中國亦不能獨全，中日兩國之運命，在歷史上地理上實爲一體，故日本對華新政策，即立足於此種根本事實上，中國國父孫先生之大亞洲主義，汪主席領導之國民政府，在中國參戰以前，固已充分認識中日關係之根本事實，故汪主席當大東亞戰爭勃發之時，即聲明與日本同甘共苦，表明中國所循之途徑，但中國若處於中立之立塲，則共同遝命之認識，不能澈底表現。或有謂大東亞戰爭，僅爲日本與英美之戰爭，然在事實上，中日兩國已處於同生共死之關係，日本若敗於英美，則中國不兔於減亡，中國之發展與繁榮，實以大東亞戰爭能否勝利爲先决條件，中國之參戰。即足以證明，中國對此已有澈底之自覺。中國今已脫却不平等條約之桎梏。站於自主平等完全獨立國之地位，此更證明中國參戰之前途，其所獲之成果矣。</p>
<h3>中樞昨舉行　隆重紀念儀式</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　今（九日）日適逢我國府參戰一周年紀念，中樞爲示隆重紀念起見，特於是日上午十時於國民政府大禮堂舉行參戰一周年擴大紀念儀式，到國府各院部會處長官暨高級職員約二百餘人，汪主席躬親蒞臨主持。主席御藍袍黑褂，精神　鑠，一如往昔。十時正紀念儀式遂於軍樂鏗鏘聲中開始，行禮如儀後，由汪主席宣讀參戰佈吿。旋肅立爲前綫將士爭取勝利致敬，爲傷兵將士康復默禱致祝，爲陣亡將士靜默致悼，繼全體高唱參戰歌，紀念儀式遂在悠揚軍樂聲中終了。平等條約之桎梏。站於自主平等完全獨立國至地位，此更證明中國參戰之前途，其所獲之成果矣。</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　國府本日上午十一時由國府委員褚民誼氏代表主席，在國民政府大客堂招待在京各國使節，計到有日本大使館大使，前田中將，松村參事官，太田參事官，坂田參事官，小柴輔佐官，寺島秘書官，清水書記官，滿洲國大使館呂大使，三浦公使，張參事官，佟武官，西存軸佐官，丁秘書官，田厚秘書官，德國大使館韋爾曼大使。柏凌秘書，吉博利總領事等，全體共進香檳，爲大東亞戰爭前途致祝，情緖至爲熱烈。</p>

<h3>德積極強化　西歐要塞</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　據傳　美爾元帥前曾詳細視察各地德軍防務，並與德西歐洲駐軍司令倫特斯提將軍進行協議確立防禦歐洲之萬全措置，以準備邀擊反軸心軍進攻歐陸之企圖。德軍當局於七日上午會見國際記者團時。曾就德軍之防禦情勢詳細宣稱如次：　德軍已於大西洋岸杜佛海峽海岸地帶及北海岸一帶，已構築千餘處要塞陣地，設置八五糎長距　砲六千餘門岸敷設數百萬機雷。復於挪威海岸設置大砲一千七百門，到處構成要塞，現自俾劉素山曰　至那維克全長四千五百公里海岸綫一帶之歐洲防壁均已完成，且於該要塞綫背後構成錯雜之防衛組織。以反軸心軍於何地登陸，德軍均可利用內綫作戰之有利地勢而邀擊之，更無論何時，德軍均可直向敵軍地點派遣有力機械化部隊。反軸心空軍刻正不分書夜攻擊以上德軍陣地，故諒其必早已洞悉德軍守備之如何堅強也。</p>
<h3>舊波瀾國境　坦克大會戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　伐吐丁所部蘇軍，自於基補叫方實行猛攻後，已於六日在　波蘭國境西方十二公里之拉基特諾市一帶，與德軍反攻甚烈，蘇軍傷亡頗衆，該方面蘇軍進攻之日標，乃在奪回交通要衝　爾奴伊。據前綫消息，蘇軍爲救援該方面蘇軍，已在諾維格勒伏林斯克兩方面展開攻勢，目下正在自羅威諾東方國境迄齊杔米爾西方之波倫諾厄戰綫上，展開大規模坦克車徹夜激戰。因戰綫已移至舊波蘭國境內，致蘇波兩國關係已生新波紋，蘇聯方面始終堅持一九三九年編入烏克蘭領土之立塲，蘇情報局七日夜發表之戰　對之稱爲西烏克蘭戰綫。</p>
<h3>傅美蘇締結　戰後協定</h3>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據海通社倫敦消息：倫敦經濟界，對於所傳美蘇締結為數　美金一百萬萬元之戰後協定一事，仍抱　疑梯度。美國「每與潮」報最近在評論中指出，所傳羅斯福總統已攜孩協定之章案抵達德　　，並已與達林商討細則一說，尚未　官方證實。</p>

<p>廣田部長繼起祝辭</p>
<p>旋即恭　陳市長致訓（訓詞另錄，，編由盟邦來賓日大使館廣田情報部長致祝辭：今天値此中國參戰第一週年紀念日在這個時候，鄗人可以說一句慶祝的話，這是實在榮幸了回顧起來，中國奮然興起，來對於亞細亞的宿敵英美，宣吿開戰以來，已經過了一年的實現，其間把我們所得很多光的戰果，和根據大東亞各鳥族的自覺　造成飛躍建設的記錄，才能够印在大東亞的歷史上，「亞細亞之覺醒」一句話日本早已提倡了，現在呢，除緬甸，菲律賓兩國，已經獨立以外，自由印度政，也已成立了，遷印度尼西亞民族，他們的參與政治也實現了。如此大東亞十萬萬民族的眞正的自由獨立和解放，將就實現了。同時在英美一百年間的榨取和壓制之下，被虐待的亞細亞民族頭上將可望見自由的陽光，去年十一月初，發表的大東亞宜言，實在是衝動世界的視聰，可是這就是亞細亞十萬萬民族，在大東亞戰爭之下，離開英美一百年的桎梏，以謀建設和統一亞細亞本來之　想和意志的表現，而且對於世界全人類表示了新的文明和和平的進路。這個共同宣言，第二條說「大東亞各國，共同確保大東亞的安定，建設根據道義的共存共榮之秩序」這條民族共存共榮的大原則，與國父孫中山先生所說的「欲實現大東亞主義，應須以固有文化　基礎，固有文化是道德仁義是也」，比較起來，這兩國思想簡直是一樣的意義。一方面拿新中國和日本的關係說起來，自去年十月三卞日，中日同盟條約成立以來，兩國的關係，更加鞏固。同時中日兩國，就在亞細亞獨立戰爭，即大東亞戰爭的中心的地位，而且團結成大東亞民族的中心，如此同生共死的决意，更加深刻，彼此變成一體，儘景努力邁進，完遂戰爭。看這種情形，鄙人感覺着特別痛快了，拿中國方面番起來，中國已經收回多年被英美侵略的主權，對此日本方面，根據這義的精神，儘量帮忙的這件事，各位都知道了，今後更加努力，以後才能够實現孫中　先生的理想，而且新中國之創造，隨着大東亞戰爭之經過，漸趨實現，這是不可疑惑的事，所以我們也進一步更加協力，以使中日兩國關係，達到劃期的親密程度，以欲盡保衛東亞上很有力量的友邦的責任，因此鄙人相信中國之復興，是復興亞細亞的前驅，大東亞戰爭開始以來，已經進入第三年了，戰局益加凄愴苛烈，可是近代戰爭的勝敗，决不在一時的僥倖，而在國家總力的結合上而决定了。現在呢，我們方面十萬萬亞細亞民族倔起來了，因此這個亞細亞民族的力量結合，而造成鞏固的力量，才能够確保大東亞戰爭之必勝不敗的地位，鄙人相信勝利的榮光，總在全亞細亞民族集團的共同建設上。</p>

<p>參戰目的解放東亞</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭已展開兩年多了，我們參戰也一週年了。大東亞的局勢，在前方獲得不斷的勝利，在後方更是天天增强了力量，這是我們大家所知道的。可是今天我們更要知道，這次戰爭是畏期的，戰堪上戰鬥，雖仍然繼續，而戰爭勝利的目的，已完全達到了。日本展開大東亞戰爭的目的，和我們參加大東亞戰爭的目的，首在於東亞各民族的解放。現在中國已完全自由獨立，一切不平等條　，已經廢除了，菲律查和緬甸也由壓迫中解放出來，獨立建國了，馬來和介哇的民衆，也實行參政了，甚至仍然在英美　　下的印度，也成立了臨時政府了，這都可以證明大東亞戰爭的目的，巳完全達到了。（未完）</p>

<h3>柴崎少將的一生</h3>
<p>柴崎惠次少將，於去年十一月二十五日，率領守衛達拉瓦，瑪金島之日本海軍陸戰隊四千五百名，壯烈殉國，此種玉碎精神，足以永垂不朽。本文介紹柴崎少將的生平事續。</p>
<p>明治二十七年（西歷一八九四年）四月九日，無俸貴族柴崎廣八氏生第六子，這就是柴崎惠次少將。家道富有，曾數輩經營農業及金融業，在上東條村，門第可以說是數一數二，在某種意義上說，少將或許是幸福的，但少將並非是養尊處優長大的</p>
<p>少年惠次，是在嚴父席八氏的敎管裏，以及慈母樟女士的愛撫裏，鍛練成强健的體格。</p>
<p>「雖然是不聽話的小玩皮鬼，但决不是無法無天的小孩子」。在其侄柴崎鹿之助氏的回憶裏，也隱約地暗示出精神奕奕的惠次小朋友之磅　鬥志。未入小學前，從未和附近的兒童玩要過，但一人學就突然成爲「交際家」，被全體同級所注意，所愛戴。</p>
<p>天賦的一副整齊容貌，從父母遺傳來的　直性格，對於萎靡和頹廢者，是往往加以輕視的。恰是日俄戰爭剛剛結束，在明治晚年兒童們所最喜愛的遊戲：如「列陣」和「戰鬥」裏，曾大顯身手。尤其在舉校休息時間，或放學後，這位眉淸目秀的少年惠次，總是在效外遊戲中，充任主角。縱令精力竭盡，但也不屈服，至於功課，當然也是不服氣的，總是位列前茅。</p>
<p>小學時代生活</p>
<p>小學時代的唯一知已，現任上東條村副的山本一直太郎氏（四十九歲），曾回憶往時的情形說：「閣下在遊戲方面總是精神異常，而爲同級中的主角，但在學業方面，又是向不認輸的發奮家。無論在學業方面，也無論在運動方面，只要一開始作，則必能貫潵始終，就是道樣一種性格。」</p>
<p>他的父親常常對他說：「兒宣時代不要想飛黃騰達。錢若聚斂多了，就不會成爲偉人」。</p>
<p>然而他的父親，很早就把公家的特業：五千兀存款，一町二段步（約合一百十Ares）的地和山，就交給了少年惠次。少年惠次，是村中傑出人材之一，於一九〇七年四月，以優秀的成績，考入兵庫縣立小野中學。</p>
<p>中學時代生活</p>
<p>在家鄉的高小，獲得優秀的成績，而畢業了的少年柴崎，於一九〇七年四月，昇入兵庫縣立小野巾學了。小野中學，是接收一枊藩王的藩學而舉辦的，當時曾是東播地方，唯一的縣立中學，地點幽靜，校風純樸，所以姬路及明石方面的大家子弟，全都濟濟於此。</p>
<p>小野中學，距離少年柴崎的柴崎的家鄕上東條村，有四里（約合十二公里弱）之遙，如果是現在，當然就可以騎脚踏車，或坐其他種車天天上學，然而交通不便的當時，凡是距離八公里以上者，便都是住宿生，所以，少年柴崎也就搬到中學的宿舍裏住宿，受着加古川淸水的洗禮，渡過了五年的中學生活，於是在不知不覺中，渣染上了小野中學的精神「蜻蛉精神」。昇入中學後的少年柴崎，給一般人的印象，是忠厚，魄力，而學業方面體育方面，是兼爲優等的模範生，這是當時同學一致交口稱譽的事。另外在運動方面，不論劍道。柔道。網球。器械體操等，都沒有不成的，劍道曾就敎於舊藩士，永本敎官，寒冬訓練，總是先到，且是最優秀者。、在吉　貝特島尙未壯烈犧牲前，按前綫傳來的報道，他爲了獎勵將士的運動，曾在島上建築起網球塲來。在中學時代，網球曾　他的拿手遊戲，一有閉暇，就和同學在宿舍傍邊的網球塲上比較勝負。那末少年柴崎，由於何種動機，才投效海軍的呢加古川的淸流，配合着幽雅的平原曠野，這是在戰國兵　時代，羣雄爭霸的所在，也曾是豐臣秀吉征服中國（日本內地之一地名）的根據地，他常常聰到這類鄕土的故事，於是便在幼年的心靈裏，激起憧憬和敬慕軍人的心理。</p>
<p>此外，姬路師團將士的野外演習，是經常出現於少年柴崎的眼前的，又何况附近的靑野個原有良好的演習塲，所以各地的將士都常常製集於此，其耀武揚威的雄糾糾姿態，不時　　於少年柴　的腦際，尤其是姬路的旅長小野客信少將，善通寺的師長土屋光春中將等，常常單人獨騎，表現着馬上將軍的雄姿，來遊是地。於是對於中學生們的心板上，深深地刻鎭上一個景慕軍人的烙印。日俄戰爭後不久，在小野中學學生間曾非常流行着一種做做軍官帽的短舌學生　，這也正是羨慕軍官的一種表現。如果少年柴崎常此以往地把這種心境發展下去，當然可能促使他過陸軍，然而二年級的時候，神戶　　曾舉行壯大的閱艦典冖，曾親眼看見三笠號軍艦等帝國海軍的精華，於是使决心投效海軍了。根據柴崎少將的同班同學，曾任小野中學蜻蛉會理事的前田軍次氏之回憶，當時曾在野瀨田佼長的率領之下，三百學生向早朝學校出發旅行，步行到十六公里的地方土山，然後坐火車至神戶，分宿於各寺院內。本來打算坐發動機船拖曳着的平面船去看閱艦典禮，然而當時正是氣候無常的十一月時節，在途中海上的風濤大作，於是山地長大的這羣學生中，便出現了許多暈船者，結果是很敗興地半途而返。少年柴崎當時究竟是否也曾暈船，雖然記不清楚了，但當時差不多是沒有例外的。</p>
<p>第二天，只好在陸地上　望帝國海軍的威容，由於天氣少微的變化，面就取消原意，這眞是海國日本男子的莫大恥辱。各位敎師也曾特別講述過海軍對日本的重要性，於是就更加決心參加海軍了。少年柴崎，從此以後，就拼命學習與休　，以打破過去的海軍記錄為唯一的目標。為了努力運動以鍛煉身心，而甚至在刺骨的厥風裏，也不穿　衣。關於學科，是一個問題徹底解決了後，再開始研究其他的，這種貫澈始終的精神，眞是令人肅然起敬。平常在夜裏，用功到一兩點鐘，眞是算不上什麽希罕的事。三年級的時候，土屋光春將軍來校參觀，且曾對我個講了許多關於「普魯士強盛」的時局故事。他說，國家的興隆，全賴乎軍備。於是這位將軍的話，甚至一字一名者深深地印在少年柴崎的心坎上。</p>
<p>柴崎入校住宿的時候，也是在南洋死於美軍手的　井寶太郞陸軍中將（當時為五年級老班生）為室長，瘟受　位前輩許多的指導。但少年柴崎　入老班生的時候，也被公舉為室長。野瀨田校長對於學校的風氣紀律，是絕對嚴格的，凡違犯校規或成績不良者，都曾一一勒令退學，有時實行降級處分。每年入學時，一班總在九十名左右，然而畢業時，則只剩三十名左右了，這已經是見空司貫的常事了。但少年柴崎被舉為室長的時候，凡不知好歹的學生，他總是申斥着說：「學生應當有學生的樣子，無論如何要守自己的本分才對」。因為他本人是寡言力行的人，所以全寢室的同學，對於這樣奮勉學習及休養的柴崎室長的話，沒有不聽從的，於是少年柴崎，就成為全校的推進力。雖然是一位嚴格的室長，但星期六歸宿時，因為他的家當時是釀酒業者，所以星期天晚上回校的時候，從來沒有忘記過給全寢室的同學，帶酒米製成的糕餅回來吃。這樣看來，他又是一位極富於感情的少年。</p>
<p>海軍學校時代</p>
<p>常時海軍兵學校，是搜　着全國的高材生，眞可以說是人材濟濟，至於鄕間中學　業的優等生，「我一定要給大家爭點光」，於是便參加入學考試，寬　而突破入學考試難　，眞替小野中學揚眉吐氣不少，同時鄕老都認為他是奇才。在山清水秀的江田島，拼命修文練武的這位海軍舉生柴崎少將，入學不久，即大露頭角。在堂堂威武的體格裏，充又處於育才植堅的優良學府環境裹，且　陶於恩咸兼施的前輩敎官之指導下，於是天賦的素質，愈益得以發揮及伸張。</p>
<p>在該校的成績，也像往昔一樣，總是名列前茅。縱或從他的同班同學口中所稱譽的話：「　聰明的傢伙」，也可以知道他的成績是如何的好。他不僅有超人的智能，而且有百折不撓的毅力，這眞可以說是一位智勇雙全的人物。少將生來就有出類拔萃的才能，且自己努力不懈，很知道磨練，於是可以說錦上添花，無上英才，他不僅有健壯的體格，且有敏捷果斷的幹才，對於　道，柔道，弓道，角力等，者有精深的造就。甚至回家省親的兩三小時內，也要跑到後院去整理射箭塲，獨自默默無言地熱心練習射箭。少將對於劍道方面，尤其對於泰山壓頂式，是一般人望而生畏的。</p>
<p>在江田島這樣過了三年，其不屈不撓的刻苦精神，竟佐柴崎養成文武兼備的武將素質。</p>
<p>少將對於後輩的指導，也從未表示過倦怠的意思。當他在兵學校讀書的期間，曾回到母校小野中學去玩過，且曾給學校帶去好多江田島生活的照片，以及大日本軍佔領上海的實際戰事照片。然而現在，在該校中只保存着這樣悲痛的遺物，而少將竟死於敵人之手，全鄕里的年靑人，都願追隨着少將，踏着先烈的血跡，殺向敵人。少將在晚年，曾在兵學校担任敎官。同時担任敎官的海軍名　敎授小林賢藏氏，曾關於少將的為人，說過以下的話。「是一位非常沉靜恬淡的人物，從未隨便呵斥過學生。我總想要模倣這種態度。也許他的內心，是像火焰般的燃燒着。他在敎官時代，他曾死子一個兒子，但悲痛從未形於色，如有慰問，則只回答說自己身體軟弱不堪，然後立刻就變為常態。我再重複一句，凡是不喜多說話的人，一遇緊要關頭，就會作出驚人的事件來，在平常時的少將，絕看不出像一位偉人，甚至他崇拜大楠公的事情，以及他是武道大家的事情，如不看報，我還不知道。」</p>
<p>晚年當副官，當參謀，當指揮官，無職而不勝任愉快，且發揮　　果斷手腕，這不能不說是在江田島打下的基礎，甚至最後在南海的一個現島上，邀擊十倍以上的大敵，實行决戰死鬥，肉搏衝鋒，終於英勇就義，成為保護大日本帝國之神社，這也只有在江田島生活中，始能培植出來。現在太平洋的戰火愈益熾烈的時際，而能以馬革喪屍，充分表現出陸戰隊的傳統精神，我們在讚頌少將永垂不朽的功德之餘，更耍以一萬萬人民的精誠團結，一致十五日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>寂寞的故事</h3>
<p>— 虹影</p>
<p>嚴外怒吼着的風，儘是呼呼的，呼呼地，偉　吞了世上所有的一切，天上沒有星，也沒有月，是厚厚的灰黑色的一片。</p>
<p>終於漸漸的天黑了，就是長滿了白　子的老　的臉。也漸漸的看不出了，在這黑暗之中</p>
<p>「嗤」，老王擦了一根洋火，點亮了油亮，　股淡黃色的光，便整個地充滿了這間小小的房十內，並且時時還夾着令人要嘔吐的油臭味。</p>
<p>老五裏了裏散開來的胸口的衣裳然後，很　練的從懷內拖出一根不滿二尺長的煙管，對着淡黃色的燈光，閙着眼睛的吸起煙來，好像浸在沈思裏似的，白色的煙，一口一口地從他的嘴內　出。</p>
<p>然，他睜開了眼睛，望了望我，好像現在才想展了裏還有一個我似的。</p>
<p>「冷的很，是吧！小孩子，」他和善的和我說了，接着又噴出了一口烟</p>
<p>「並且怪寂寞的，」我　着寂寞的聲調對他說的。</p>
<p>，你也懂得寂寞，好，我現在就來給你講「個寂寞的故事。」現</p>
<p>那是很久很久以前的一個冬天，是我正在二十幾的時候，你看，我今年已經五十八歲了，那不是很久長久的前了嗎？</p>
<p>天，在北方，更是冷的訂怕，騎在馬上，沿着時　的山道，那風就像　一般的在你以臉上括着括着，痛嗎？其實早已痛得失去了所有的感覺。</p>
<p>塞外的砂　，石子，也給風帶了過來，只耍是有風的地方，便也有砂塵的存在，不消說，臉上是已經結滿了厚厚的一層了</p>
<p>清鼻涕，不斷的流下來，冷得懶得去楷他一下，任他流，於是灰塵來了，也結成傑鐵鍊似的兩條，平直的掛在你的上唇</p>
<p>可是，我不怕冷，在二十歲的時候，我正是一個年富力强的小夥子，嚇，膀子伸出來，像拳頭一樣的糧，冷，冷得什麼，不過現在沒有用了，我巳經老了，現在已經是你們的世界了。</p>
<p>那時，我就在北方，在一家衙門裏，做着專送公文的差使，騎在馬上，橫背着公文的袋子，現在，想起來，還非常的有　呢！</p>
<p>有一天，正是一個在冬季極冷的天氣，可是，我却在尙着汗，就是我的馬，在牠的兩頰上，也在流着濕手的汗水。</p>
<p>我只趕打着馬，要牠往前奔，我的心就急得好像在燒紅的鐵鍋上爬着的螞　一樣，因爲天已在漸漸的黑：而我還須再趕五十里的路，才能到我要送的公文的地方，可是，天却漸漸的黑了，眼望着天上是厚厚地灰黑色的一片，可是，忚那知道我焦急的情緒呢，何况在我的背上，芷背着一件主人關照了愼重又愼重的公文呢。</p>
<p>終於，天是黑了下來，騎在馬上的我，不斷的想起了，在早晨主人吿訴我在這路上，現在土匪時常出現的事情。</p>
<p>這時，我怕了，在這樣漆黑的一片中，天上沒有星，也沒有月，對於風的呼號，夜島的驚起，我總以為在島黑的一片中，立出了十多個强盜，對着我，要施行强迫的手段。</p>
<p>可是，總於沒的什麼，直到我在半山中，停在一個小客棧裏的時候，雖然，還有三十里就右到我到的地方，但是，我再也沒有勇氣繼績前道了，就是現在想想吧，在島黑的山道上，沒有星，也沒有月的晚上，一個人騎在馬上，是一件多麼可怕的事呵。</p>
<p>洗了一盆水，喊小二來，呌他再喚一盆，可是，不一食水又黑了，呀，臉上　直是全是灰呀，我也　得再喚了。</p>
<p>一個人對着一盞油燈，眞寂寞呀，你不是說你現在寂寞嗎？可是，這算得什麼，那天，我才算得　寂寞呢。</p>
<p>燈漸漸的　了下去，我　轉了一下，不久又　了下去，原來，燈油已經沒有了，喊小二，小二却在那裏睡熟了，喊了半天，他醒了，裝滿了油，又呌他拿來了一瓶　，和一碗下酒的小菜，於是，我　酌了起來，客棧內所有的人都睡熟了，只有我一人，在淡貨的燈光下，獨百的飲着酒，這是多麼的</p>
<p>酒漸漸的喝完了。：於是我也預備睡覺了，可是，睡不熟，無論怎樣也　不熟，這是由於旅途的過分的疲勞呢，還是由於酒後的猛烈的刺激，那我可不知道了。</p>
<p>我只是睜大着雙眼，望着紙糊的　壁，看見耗子從我的床上跑過去，這時，在屋外，風是在怒吼着，好像和今天一樣，只是呼呼地，呼呼呼地，像要吞噬了世人所有的一切一樣。</p>
<p>在淡黃色的光下，我完全漫在深思裏！（未完）</p>
<h3>卜者</h3>
<p>— 趙羊</p>
<p>鬧市的一個角落里，不大爲人所注意的地方，一個枯樹枝一樣瞎老人，孤獨的坐在那里。</p>
<p>小的破矮木橙，把他坐在那里十幾個年頭，上了銹似的日子一天天過去了。</p>
<p>誰知道他是什麼了人呢？有兒子？也許，……</p>
<p>他緊閉了他的　眼，沒勁的，神秘的，搖動着一雙　朽的木筒，那上頭的四個字一女生神課一由朱紅也變了灰黑的顏色，一些「神　」被手撫撲得發光。</p>
<p>他　精的口角流着延水，向過路人譯着生意「占定行向，　人，婚姻，不靈不要錢……」</p>
<p>可是，從早到晚，沒有一個人會來找到他，他有一個人會來找到他，他摸素着破口袋里的幾張角票和一個飢餓的肚子：「買塊燒餅吃吧？……」</p>
<p>「唉，什麼命運呢？給自己占上一　吧！」</p>
<p>他這樣的想着，虔誠的搖起木筒來，那些個小竹　振動着，他用　抖的右手伸进去摸着他的一些老朋友們：</p>
<p>「第六六籤下下，此　主人凶」</p>
<p>「主大凶，主大凶，唉，倒霉的東西！」</p>
<p>他急速的又把他的老朋友扔進去，眼角流着淚，滴在衣襟上……。</p>
<p>幾天過去了。</p>
<p>依然，那個不大被人注意的地方，卜者躺在那里了，一領破席裏着他，眼角不會再流淚了，停着一只蒼　在搓脚，那個破的　筒也一樣的倒在他的身旁……。</p>

<h3>足球聯賽第一循環　東華會已完成覇業　一警與葡商均甚努力</h3>
<p>上海足球聯賽，第一循環，雖尙有數戰，然東華會於上週一（三日）力克僑聯之後，第一循環已六戰六勝完成霸業，祇視第一循環之勞力點。茲追叙評昨前二日之戰·先說昨早逸園。華人巨頭聯誼隊迎戰葡商，葡商曾要求改期蓋有數個正式隊員須服務於當日之防空運動，然未爲當局核准，乃凑乙組隊員史派斯及後備人員出塲，反視聯誼則人馬到齊。由此以觀，聯誼必勝　疑，事與觀察相背，我乃欲有論者：</p>
<p>陣容調整不善聯誼大爲失策</p>
<p>聯誼以左翼人材之缺乏，斯戰試以瞿永福担任，面以蔡聲淼任中衛綫鑄成大錯，夫瞿歷任中衛綫與宋鄭，　應，一致　爲東亞第一條防綫。雖屬譽之過甚，尙不失爲標準中衛綫也。逎者以蔡出任　呼應不靈，中綫一斷，何得而進攻耶？且也瞿　試左翼，不成其局，此非其本人之罪，調度失策也。下半時起恢復原來陣容，乃有起見。最後更以李義臣在前綫之不得其所，與吳祺祥對調，得能反敗爲勝，此爲適應現實，能隨機應變，非此不爲功也。論個人，以吳祺詳為最出色，任後衛面面俱倒，無一漏洞，出主中帥，又能單騎深入。殘局中取勝，洵不易也。次以許文奎之脚頭，巧妙淸浙，允稱佳搆，惜乎好花無緣葉相扶，是以不得其所。俞振岳上半時三十五分鐘時，高保正在人業中，得李載臣傳球叩中，又五分鐘即爲葡商左　開角球爲飽休脫頂進，各一平手。</p>
<p>下半時，葡商在二十分鐘時，勃拉達右路進兵，劉顯漢束手無策，葡商反以二對一領先，聯誼先勝而敗，豈肯屈服，乃吳祺祥與李義臣對調。吳祺祥不負使命單騎深入，建功而返，離終塲尙餘十分鐘，聯誼否極泰來。俞振岳福至心靈，得高保正來球，竟爾吿中，聯誼乃得以三對二倖勝，危極　險極！</p>
<p>義軍參加僑聯觀衆大失其望</p>
<p>前日上週六下午三時半在膠州公園僑聯初逢一警，爲足聯第二循環之一幕。僑聯有義果九人參戰，於是衆望所歸。膠州園內，亦見人頭濟濟，盛况固不亞於其他重要賽也。然結果一警竟以五對一大勝僑聯所得一球，亦爲十二碼罰球。僑聯狼狽，殺得如此焦頭爛額，愛戴之球迷，相率嘆氣。一警隊仍一貫作風，能攻能守，亦米見其有如何特出之表演，唯守門浮尼克知所改善，進步不少。可見事在人爲，唯恐不圖上進。僑聯守門麥尼蒂三撲三空，氣數一至於此。維拉。迪盤那左右兩翼，拖泥帶水，一事無成！全隊如蝸牛之緩進，其以何而得？如再不求體力之活動，義軍前途，實不堪設想矣。一警前鋒仍以勞勃司脫夫爲靈魂，而偶然出塲之安潑萊夫出人意料，連得第一第三兩球，幸運有以致此。亦努力之收獲，中衛綫上米海洛夫，郁黎華均肯奔能搶，輔前顧後，良材也。</p>
<p>上半時一警仕二十分鐘內運得二球，不可一世。麥尼　且以傷離塲。</p>
<p>下半時小黃毛再中第四球，羅蒂又微傷，繼而羅旭萊犯十二碼手球，薩拉蒂執行命中，打破鴨蛋記錄，臨去秋波，小黃毛再攻入一球，五對一，一警凱旋，其比數與第一循環同。（梅潔）</p>
<h3>西青甲組形勢明朗　華聯藥能常勝　東方巨人追隨於後</h3>
<p>西靑籃球甲組賽，本刋已有系統之記載。上二期一以篇幅關係，一以停止未刋·茲先列一形勢表，再簡評上二週之戰悄，以爲愛好者之參考焉。</p>
<p>上月二十日之夜，汕隊取三輸，東方敗大華，均如實力之上下，戰情之經過，平淡無足述者。而二十二日晚之二戰，均出意料之外。華南之敗于蒙納克也，全在球運不利，非戰之罪。華影見屈于三輪，其理由有二，一以華影指導不到，乃主張一多便亂，二以三輪董椿傳祥瑞時來遝來，華影乃慘敗二十五日過聖　休息。二十七日之夕，巨人力擒仁餘，仁餘缺少射　人材，是為致命傷。巨人在正常中，絕少進步，而未見退化，保特常態之隊伍。東方拒　納克頗　驚險，幸許文奎有靈，有投皆中，包松圓賣力，內外兼諸小將不堪其　。另一塲，大華抗巨人，雖敗猶能以智勝人。</p>
<p>上週之戰</p>
<p>汕隊勝同仁，爲三日夜之戰。按汕隊方年少之輩，正有爲之狄，記者亦屢加鼓勵。而觀乎此戰，非將未見進步，抑且驕氣橫生。陳淸江。陳　光更喜弄花巧，此要亦爲未能登峯造極之故。有說此爲過程中之現象；現願早日改善，否則終難成大器。同仁隊以張邦綸誤卯，宣氏五弟兄認眞到底，戰來竭盡球藝之表演。除體力稍差，無暇可擊，勝敗不計也。比數爲五十七對四十二，汕隊勝。</p>
<p>共餘一塲，大華要求－改期。－五日之甲組戰。首塲業餘聯　於三輸。前者軍心渙散，我亦不必多所指摘！</p>
<p>末塲，華影克同仁，說者均謂冷門，實則非也。前在百樂門莖影亦曾勝同仁，蓋兩隊與術如出一轍。而華影人長。同仁反之，此勝負之判，益以華影錢指導條然涖臨，軍心一壯，此所以勝之又一理由也。四十五對三十八，相　七分，尙在理想之中。</p>
<p>七日之二仗，華南對業餘，後者又要求改期，前晚棄權，此番又改期，其　有不得已之苦衷耶？</p>
<p>華聯藥在延長時間中勝蒙納克，此戰華聯藥，最初頗能振作，入後反見紊亂。孔廣益火氣太大，　錫麟花巧過多，張錦　多弄小聰明，此均爲應改過之點。蒙納克亦賴地頭之熟，射　　純熟，種氣又足　斗越態越勇，有能爲之隊。是　，法定時問。二十九對二十九，可見過程之緊凑，延長五分鈹內　，華聯藥以七！一勝，總結束爲三十六對三十。華聯藥保持常勝（必賢）</p>

<h3>On Employing Personnel</h3>
<p>Our heartfelt and sole proposition for national politics is the rule of law. Because when the government abides by the law and the people abide by the law, the nation embarks on the path of the rule of law, and politics naturally becomes transparent and clear. However, in the thirty-plus years of the Republic of China, the laws we have created and the laws we have adopted from foreign countries are countless, yet the Republic of China remains not a nation of law. The biggest reason lies in personnel; as the saying goes, "There are laws but no one to govern." Therefore, we have sincere requests and hopes regarding the government's employment of personnel from time to time. Recently, the central authorities have paid close attention to employing personnel, which is the most optimistic phenomenon in China. We would like to offer a few more "humble and insignificant" opinions.</p>
<p>Dismissing Redundant Staff. Redundant staff are the biggest waste in national finances; everyone knows this. However, the greatest harm of redundant staff is not this. The greatest harm of redundant staff is obstructing work. Observing Chinese politics over the past thirty-plus years, we can decisively say that any organization with many redundant staff fails to produce decent results. From a small section or department to a large division or ministry, none can escape this common rule. This is because the tension and struggle of a few cannot withstand the decadence and laziness of the majority. Over time, it can make tense people unable to be tense, and struggling people unable to struggle. The impact is that the entire staff is corrupted, and there is no reason why the entire organization should not be corrupted. The causes of redundant staff are mostly the placement of private individuals or perfunctory requests. We hope the authorities understand that placing private individuals and perfunctory requests are not only a waste of public funds but also sufficient to hinder the progress of the enterprise, affect the future of the entire organization, and further affect the faith of the people of the whole country in the governing authorities. Speaking of the redundant staff themselves, developing lazy habits ruins their whole lives. Speaking of those who make requests and introductions, they mislead a friend and mislead an organization. Speaking of the authorities who employ redundant staff, they lose the faith of the entire nation due to the corruption of an enterprise and further bury their entire personal future. As the saying goes, "One wrong move, the whole game is lost." We hope everyone pays attention.</p>
<p>Engaging Capable Talents. Zeng Guofan said, "The strength of a country depends on obtaining talent." He also said, "Revival depends on obtaining talent." The so-called "talent" refers to those who are loyal to the country, are down-to-earth, and work hard. However, capable talents are not like mediocre talents, let alone those who can be "summoned at will." Especially in China, with Confucian thought as the center for thousands of years, the self-esteem of capable talents has shaped the traditional spirit of society. Therefore, the engagement of capable talents has created the most noble social custom and is considered the greatest achievement of the government authorities. And after capable talents are hired, their selfless struggle, even unto death, is considered the highest honor for the country and the individual. Anyone who has read "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" (the book "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" has a huge impact on the national psyche) knows about Liu Bei's "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage" and also knows about Zhuge Liang's "Giving His All Until His Heart Stops." Because of Liu Bei's "Three Visits to the Thatched Cottage," Zhuge Liang was able to wholeheartedly "Give His All Until His Heart Stops." "A scholar dies for his confidant" is the cultivation and aspiration of a scholar. In the current extraordinary environment, we hope that the capable talents of the entire China will no longer play Zhuge Liang's "Sleeping in Retirement at Longzhong," because there is no Longzhong now, and it is not the time to sleep in retirement. However, we hope that the government authorities will all have the spirit of "respecting the virtuous and condescending to the scholars" and all be like Liu Bei, who "thirsts for talent."</p>
<h3>Chief of the Coast Intelligence Department Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Embassy in China, Chief of the Coast Intelligence Department, gave a broadcast speech at 9:20 p.m. on the 9th, titled "Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War." The gist of it was that the National Government's participation in the war was completely based on an independent position and arose from an irresistible inner demand, because overthrowing Britain and the United States, restoring China, and defending East Asia were all original goals of the Chinese revolution and were consistent with the common requirements of the Greater East Asia War. The Chinese people should fully appreciate the significance of the Greater East Asia War and fully understand the true meaning of Japan's new policy toward China. Japanese residents in China should regard China as the most trustworthy comrade-in-arms, support each other, and strive for the victory of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Anniversary of Our Participation in the War – China, Japan, and Manchukuo Exchange Broadcasts – Encouraging Each Other to Advance Toward a Common Goal</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday, the 9th, was the anniversary of our country's participation in the war. China, Japan, and Manchukuo jointly commemorated this day. Our Premier Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchukuo State Affairs Minister Zhang exchanged congratulatory broadcasts. The text of Premier Wang's broadcast is as follows:</p>
<p>Premier Wang's Broadcast Speech Vigorously鞭策 and Practices the Declaration</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War. We welcome this anniversary with full enthusiasm, and we are determined to make greater efforts to contribute to the final victory this year. Recalling that since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been successively defeated by the Allied Japan, but their ambitions have not died, and they are barking and counterattacking. The so-called counterattacks in the past year have only increased their consumption of manpower and material resources, and the Greater East Asia front has not been shaken in the slightest. Here, I would like to express my greatest respect to the loyal, brave, hard-working, and sacrificing spirit of the officers and soldiers of the Allied Japanese Navy and Army. Allied Japan has not only established great achievements in military affairs but has also sought to unite the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia with one heart and one mind to complete the construction of independent development and common prosperity in politics, economy, and culture. Since the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance, China and Japan have re-established the foundation of permanent friendship. Since the promulgation of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the countries of Greater East Asia have obtained a common goal of advancing together and striving upward. Mencius's so-called "Heavenly time, geographical advantage, and human harmony" have all been combined. In this year of final victory, the countries of Greater East Asia have full confidence and belief. From today onwards, we must be more vigorous,鞭策 ourselves with the three major guidelines of rectifying thought, ensuring order, and increasing production, in order to fulfill China's responsibility and share the obligations of a member of Greater East Asia. Regarding the沦方, we have repeatedly given advice and hoped that they would reflect. However, since the so-called Cairo Conference, the渝方 has been sinking deeper and further astray, which is truly regrettable. However, I dare to conclude that the closer the渝方 is to Britain and the United States, the further it is from the people of the whole country. Because the recent statements of the渝方 are tantamount to clearly telling the people of the whole country that the渝方 is no longer fighting for China but for Britain and the United States. In detail, for the sake of satisfying the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade East Asia and even the whole world, the渝方 does not hesitate to be the pawns of Britain and the United States, guiding Britain and the United States to use Chinese land as a place for bombing by airplanes, and does not hesitate to go a step further to make Chinese kill Chinese and make Chinese kill East Asians. The self-destructive and rebellious behavior of the渝方 will definitely not be tolerated by the people of the whole country. Today, we can only cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, to answer the false propaganda of the渝方 with victory, and to prepare for the construction to receive the displaced people after the collapse of the渝方.</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech Wishes Allied Nations to Make Greater Efforts</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – In Prime Minister Tojo's broadcast speech, the main points are as follows: "Today last year, the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time declared that it would cooperate with Japan to complete the war. Over the past year, the National Government has been very beneficial to the Greater East Asia War by practicing this. The Japanese government hereby expresses its gratitude. In the year since China's participation in the war, from Japan's point of view, agreements on the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights have been successively implemented, and the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was fundamentally revised last October, and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was signed to establish the fundamental relationship between China and Japan. This is nothing but a concrete manifestation of Japan's founding spirit. I believe that this will achieve the common mission of China and Japan and realize Sun Yat-sen's ideals. Looking at the entire Greater East Asia, Burma first became independent last August, the Philippines also became independent in October, and the countries of East Asia jointly held the Greater East Asia Conference in November and issued the Greater East Asia Common Declaration, declaring our common beliefs to the world. The five major guidelines in the Declaration are the great charter for the construction of East Asia in the future. On the anniversary of China's participation in the war, I would like to address you and hope that the Allied Chinese people will embrace common ideals and make further efforts towards the final victory under the belief of certain victory.</p>
<p>Manchukuo Prime Minister's Broadcast Speech is Determined to Cooperate to Complete the Mission</p>
<p>Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Manchukuo State Affairs Minister Zhang delivered a broadcast speech, the main points of which are as follows: "On the occasion of the Greater East Asia War achieving brilliant results, and on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Republic of China's participation in the war, I feel heartfelt joy. Recalling that the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on this day last year, at the same time, the relationship between China and Japan has changed from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death. I greatly admire the resolute attitude of the Chinese National Government. Since the Republic of China's participation in the war, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, the natives of the South have gained the opportunity to participate in politics, and the Provisional Government of India has also been established, which shows that the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have each obtained their place, and the foundation of Greater East Asia Co-prosperity has been completely established. The ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere is about to be realized, and our position of certain victory and invincibility is also completely established. This is something that can be celebrated with my fellow Asians. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo felt the importance of its own responsibility even more. In order to practice the great meaning of the joint defense of Japan and Manchukuo with one heart and one mind, we are determined to follow the Emperor's edict, devote ourselves to strengthening our combat power and guarding the northern border, and advance with the Allied nations of East Asia towards the path of completing the holy war. China, Japan, Manchukuo, and the various countries and ethnic groups of East Asia must unite more closely, embrace the belief of certain victory, overcome all difficulties, and thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Director Iguchi Delivers a Speech Elaborating on the Significance of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Director Iguchi of the Japanese Information Bureau met with the Chinese journalist delegation on the 8th and delivered a speech, the gist of which is as follows: "This month's 9th is the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. This is not only the most memorable day in Chinese history but also in East Asian history. From the Japanese side, January 9th last year was the beginning of Japan's promotion of its new policy toward China. The fundamental purpose of Japan's policy toward China is to assist China in raising its international status and at the same time establish a close partnership and cooperation between China and Japan to seek coexistence and co-prosperity. Therefore, Japan's new policy toward China has not changed in this regard. However, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan could not fully advance toward this fundamental goal because there was a strong British and American force in China. Britain and the United States used all kinds of schemes to hinder Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japan was sometimes forced to take this path in order to deal with Britain and the United States. Therefore, China sometimes misunderstood Japan, which was caused by this. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the power of Britain and the United States in China was eliminated, and Japan was able to fully implement its policy toward China, that is, to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States on a new foundation based on Japan's righteous diplomacy. In this year, Japan has been consistently implementing its new policy according to this established policy. Japan's new policy toward China reached its peak after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in late October last year. Here, I would like to elaborate on the historical significance of the treaty to arouse the attention of the general public. The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and its attached protocol laid the foundation for China's unification and the development of a modern nation. As Chairman Wang said at the time, the Sino-Japanese relationship has opened a new era in East Asia. At the Greater East Asia Conference held in early November last year, the 1 billion people of East Asia decided on the basic principles for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. At this time, Greater East Asia showed a brilliant dawn. The basic spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration has been concretely expressed in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. If China is in a semi-colonial position, then Japan cannot prosper independently. If Japan is defeated, then China cannot be completely independent. The fate of China and Japan is historically and geographically one. Therefore, Japan's new policy toward China is based on this fundamental fact. Sun Yat-sen, the father of the Chinese nation, and the National Government led by Chairman Wang had fully recognized the fundamental facts of the Sino-Japanese relationship before China's participation in the war. Therefore, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang declared that he would share the joys and sorrows with Japan, indicating the path China would follow. However, if China is in a neutral position, the recognition of a shared destiny cannot be thoroughly expressed. Some say that the Greater East Asia War is only a war between Japan and Britain and the United States. However, in fact, China and Japan are in a relationship of sharing life and death. If Japan is defeated by Britain and the United States, then China will inevitably be reduced to destruction. The development and prosperity of China depend on whether the Greater East Asia War can be won. China's participation in the war is sufficient to prove that China has a thorough awareness of this. China has now cast off the shackles of unequal treaties and stands in the position of an autonomous, equal, and completely independent country.

<h3>Germany Actively Strengthens Western European Fortresses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) – It is reported that Marshal Rommel had previously inspected German defenses in various places in detail and agreed with General Renthe-Fink, commander of the German forces stationed in Western Europe, to establish comprehensive measures to defend Europe in order to prepare to intercept the Axis armies' attempt to attack the European continent. German military authorities met with international journalists on the morning of the 7th. The German army has built thousands of fortresses and strongholds along the Atlantic coast, the Strait of Dover and the North Sea coast, installed more than 6,000 85-millimeter long-range cannons and laid millions of mines on the coast. More than 1,700 cannons have also been installed on the Norwegian coast, forming fortresses everywhere. At present, the European Wall, which extends 4,500 kilometers along the coast from the Pyrenees Mountains to Narvik, has been completed, and a complex defense organization has been constructed behind the fortress line. No matter where the Anti-Axis armies land, the German army can use the advantageous terrain of internal line operations to intercept them. Moreover, no matter when, the German army can directly dispatch powerful mechanized units to the enemy's location. The Anti-Axis air force is attacking the above-mentioned German positions day and night, so it is expected that they must have already understood how strong the German defenses are.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Tank Battle on the Old Polish Border</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Soviet forces under Vatutin launched a fierce attack in the direction of Kiev, they engaged in fierce counterattacks with German forces around the city of Rakitno, 12 kilometers west of the Polish border, on the 6th. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties. The Soviet forces' goal in the attack was to recapture the transportation hub of Korosten. According to front-line news, in order to support the Soviet forces in that area, they have launched offensives in the direction of Novograd-Volynsky. A large-scale overnight tank battle is currently underway on the Volyn-Ponnoe front from the eastern border of Rovno to west of Zhitomir. Because the front line has moved to within the old Polish border, a new ripple has been created in Soviet-Polish relations. The Soviet side has always insisted on the position of incorporating the territory into Ukraine in 1939. The Soviet Information Bureau referred to the battle as the West Ukrainian Front in its report on the war on the night of the 7th.</p>
<h3>United States and Soviet Union Conclude Post-War Agreement</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from London, London economic circles remain skeptical about the reported post-war agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union worth $1 trillion. "Every With Tide" recently pointed out in a commentary that the report that President Roosevelt had arrived in Tehran with the agreement's charter and had discussed the details with Stalin had not yet been officially confirmed.</p>

<h3>Anniversary of Joining the War - Grand Public Assembly - Mayor Chen Attends to Deliver Instructions</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Yesterday (the 9th) marked the first anniversary of the National Government's entry into the war. The citizens of Shanghai held a special municipal public representative assembly at the Great Light Theater at 10:00 AM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Venue is Decorated Solemnly and Grandly</p>
<p>On this day, the assembly venue was decorated solemnly and grandly. The national flag and a portrait of the Founding Father were hung high in the center, with the National Government's declaration of war placed below. Golden-lettered red silk banners were hung on both sides and above, with slogans such as "Correct Thinking, Strict Living," "Increase Production, Strive for Savings," and "Guarantee Security, Cooperate in Air Defense" to enlighten the public on their understanding and responsibilities regarding the National Government's entry into the war. They were eye-catching, moving, and deeply meaningful.</p>
<p>Officials and Guests Arrive One After Another</p>
<p>From 9:00 AM onwards, officials and guests arrived one after another. From the Chinese side were Mayor Chen Gongbo, Chief Secretary Xiu Yu, Director Xi Peiwen, Bureau Chief Su Chengde, Section Chief Gu Jiwu, and representatives of the presidium: Yuan Ludeng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Zhou Hualan of the Municipal Education Association, Liu Yangshan of the Municipal Party Department, Xu Liqiu of the Press Association, and Qu Zhonglun of the Municipal Women's Association. From the Allied Japanese side were Intelligence Director Hirota of the Embassy's Shanghai Office, Vice Consul Fukuma, and over two thousand public representatives from the entire city. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic, and the grand occasion was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Performing the Ceremony and Delivering the Opening Remarks</p>
<p>At precisely 10:00 AM, music was played to commence the meeting, and the ceremony was performed as required. Chairman Lu Deng read the National Government's declaration of war and led everyone in silent tribute to the fallen soldiers, and in prayer for the recovery of the wounded and sick soldiers and for victory in the Greater East Asia War. After the silence, he delivered the opening remarks: "Today is the anniversary of our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War, a day of great significance. Looking back, East Asia has been subjected to foreign aggression for more than a century. Now, fortunately, we rely on our allies to uphold the righteousness of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we cannot help but admire them. As for us, standing in the position of citizens, we should also take responsibility for this war. What responsibility? That is, each of us should do our best in our respective positions, without being decadent or romantic, sticking to our posts, advocating thrift, and accumulating all our strength and spirit, directly and indirectly, for the war, for the use of the war. This is our responsibility. I hope everyone will work hard to achieve the goal of the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Director Hirota Rises to Deliver a Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen then delivered instructions (the text of the instructions is recorded separately). Following this, Allied guest Intelligence Director Hirota of the Japanese Embassy delivered a congratulatory speech: "Today, on the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war, it is a real honor to be able to say a word of congratulations at this time. Looking back, one year has passed since China resolutely rose up and declared war on the long-time enemies of Asia, Britain and the United States. During this time, we have achieved many glorious war results, and based on the self-awareness of the various races in Greater East Asia, we have created a record of leapfrog construction, which can be imprinted on the history of Greater East Asia. Japan has long advocated the phrase "Awakening of Asia." Now, in addition to Burma and the Philippines, which have already become independent, the Provisional Government of Free India has also been established, and the participation of the Indonesian people in politics has also been realized. In this way, the true freedom, independence, and liberation of the hundreds of millions of people in Greater East Asia will be realized. At the same time, the Asian people who have been abused under the hundred years of exploitation and oppression by Britain and the United States will be able to see the sunlight of freedom. The Greater East Asia Declaration, issued in early November last year, really shocked the world. However, this is the expression of the desire and will of the hundreds of millions of people in Asia to break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States after a hundred years under the Greater East Asia War, and to seek the construction and unification of the original Asia. Moreover, it shows a new path of civilization and peace to all mankind in the world. Article 2 of this joint declaration states that "The countries of Greater East Asia shall jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality." Compared with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's saying that "to realize Greater East Asianism, we must use our inherent culture as a foundation, and inherent culture is morality, benevolence, and righteousness," these two ideas have almost the same meaning. On the one hand, taking the relationship between the new China and Japan, since the establishment of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty on October 30 last year, the relationship between the two countries has become even stronger. At the same time, China and Japan are in the central position of the Asian Independence War, that is, the Greater East Asia War, and are united as the center of the Greater East Asian people. In this way, the determination to live and die together has become even more profound, and they have become one, striving forward and completing the war. Seeing this situation, I feel particularly happy. Taking the Chinese side as an example, China has recovered the sovereignty that has been invaded by Britain and the United States for many years. Regarding this, the Japanese side, based on the spirit of righteousness, is helping as much as possible. You all know about this. If we work harder in the future, we will be able to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideals, and the creation of the new China will gradually be realized as the Greater East Asia War progresses. This is beyond doubt. Therefore, we will further cooperate to bring the relationship between China and Japan to a close and fulfill our responsibility as a powerful ally in protecting East Asia. Therefore, I believe that the revival of China is the forerunner of the revival of Asia. The Greater East Asia War has entered its third year since it began, and the war situation has become increasingly tragic and fierce. However, the victory or defeat of modern warfare is not determined by temporary luck, but by the combination of the overall strength of the country. Now, hundreds of millions of Asian people have risen up. Therefore, the combination of the strength of this Asian people will create a solid force that can ensure the inevitable victory and invincibility of the Greater East Asia War. I believe that the glory of victory lies in the joint construction of the entire Asian people's group."</p>

<h3>Mayor Chen's Instructions at the Public Assembly Commemorating Participation in the War</h3>
<p>Gentlemen: Today is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. It is also our Shanghai Air Defense Day. I would like to take this significant anniversary to say a few words to you.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Participating in the War is to Liberate East Asia</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years, and we have been participating for one year. The situation in Greater East Asia has been constantly victorious on the front lines, and our strength has been increasing day by day in the rear. This is something we all know. But today, we must also know that this war is one of awe-inspiring duration. Although the battles on the war front continue, the goal of winning the war has been fully achieved. The purpose of Japan's launching the Greater East Asia War and our participation in the Greater East Asia War is primarily the liberation of the peoples of East Asia. Now China is completely free and independent, and all unequal treaties have been abolished. The Philippines and Burma have also been liberated from oppression and established independent nations. The people of Malaya and Java have also implemented political participation. Even India, which is still under the control of Britain and the United States, has established a provisional government. This proves that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been fully achieved. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Applications for Scholarships Reach Over 10,000 in Two Days - Mr. Yoshida Tosuke Agrees to Advocate for Assistance</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day for the distribution of scholarship application forms by this newspaper's correspondent. The applicant students waited in front of the Cathay Hotel gate from as early as 3:00 AM. Their eagerness for assistance is truly deserving of sympathy. According to statistics, a total of more than 4,000 application forms were issued throughout the day yesterday, bringing the total to more than 14,000, including those issued previously. The students who came to receive the forms entered the venue in an orderly manner, and after picking up the forms, they also toured the National Common Sense Report organized by this newspaper's office. The students carefully observed and were very interested, which was also an opportunity to increase their knowledge. Yesterday, Mr. Yoshida Tosuke generously promised to advocate and assist on behalf of the Allied personnel. His kindness is deeply admirable.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday: Han Jin donated 10,000 yuan, Lin Yaodong (transferred from nearly 10,000 yuan raised) donated 10,000 yuan, Hu Yan (Mrs. Chen purchased memorial goods and transferred the funds for assistance) donated 1 yuan, totaling 22,866,251 yuan in reserve coupons.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of the National Common Sense Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Tian Xing</p>
<p>It has been a year since the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War. At the current moment when we are gradually entering a decisive stage, it is necessary for every citizen to have a clear understanding of the nature and trends of this war. At the same time, in order to further enhance everyone's understanding, Shen Bao specially organized the "Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition" on this anniversary of participation in the war.</p>
<p>Naval Attaché Kondo and President Chen of Shen Bao Accompanied by Military Officers from the Army to View the Situation</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Venue</p>
<p>The venue is located on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. As soon as you enter the venue, the first thing that catches your eye is the national flags of the seven countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, hanging high on the beams, solemn and splendid. It is awe-inspiring. The order of the exhibition is first the large-scale maps and photos of the Greater East Asia construction that has been leaping forward in the two years since the start of the war. From here, you can see the war results of the Greater East Asia's brave battle. China's leap forward and the new construction of the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere, including the Philippines, Burma, and Thailand. There are more than a hundred photos that systematically show the progress. Turning into another section, a series of giant paintings make us even more aware of how the Allied Japan is strengthening its national power and intensifying its mobilization to win the Greater East Asia War, and how their people are working hard, enduring hardship, and bravely advancing to contribute everything to the country. This tense and exciting scene, after thinking about it, how about us? Are we also tense? The most interesting thing is the models of airplanes, warships, and tanks displayed on the table, each with about five or six different types. Because they are exquisitely made and the appearance is exquisite, they are exactly the same as the real ones.</p>
<p>Overview of Shen Bao's Business and Scholarship Funds</p>
<p>At the end of the venue, there is another section, which is the Shen Bao's special publication situation that was held at that time. The 70-year-old Shen Bao is no different from a history of the progress of China's news industry and printing and editing. In addition, there are books, yearbooks, maps, monthly publications, etc. published by Shen Bao over the years, filling two long tables, especially the books published during the Qing Dynasty. Shen Bao has long been striving to promote the cultural publishing industry. Next to it is the academic performance of the scholarship recipients and the process of running the school. Because Shen Bao's Sixth Reader Scholarship Fund is issuing application forms, students can visit and collect them at the same time, which is very crowded. The number of visitors is very enthusiastic. It is estimated that more than 3,000 people arrived on the first day. Colonel Matsushima, the reporting director of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Wupan Team, and Captain Kamita, all visited the venue. Mr. Yoshida Tobo Mitsuo, a "Friend of China," also visited the venue yesterday. He expressed deep sympathy when he saw the large number of students applying for scholarships and promised to provide assistance on the spot and do his best to promote it on behalf of the Mingbang personnel to arouse sympathy. This kindness is so precious! After receiving the application forms, the students also carefully read through the entire venue, especially the students' academic achievements. They carefully observed. After they had fully browsed the exhibits in the entire venue and received the application forms, they all walked out of the venue with smiles on their faces in an orderly manner.</p>

<h3>Coming from Behind, Friendship Defeats Portuguese Merchants - Portuguese Merchants Resist Tenaciously - Three to Two</h3>
<p>The Class A friendly football match between the Friendly Team and the Portuguese Merchants took place at the Yi Yuan Stadium yesterday morning at 10:30, with referee Shen Huichun. Although the Friendly Team won 3-2, it took a great deal of effort. The Friendly Team's lineup in the first half was obviously weak, with Cai Sheng stationed at the center forward, causing the central defensive line to lose its flexibility. Qu Bingfu served as the left winger, so there was no help for the forward, and there were frequent missed opportunities. In the second half, the lineup was adjusted to increase the attack. Lan Niu Li Yichen was transferred to the defense, Wu Qixiang abandoned the defense and went on the attack, and Xu Wenkui and Yongfu remained in their original positions, which immediately showed improvement.</p>

<h3>Stable Trend in Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions Last Week</h3>
<p>Financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai stabilized last week after experiencing sharp fluctuations. Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, businesses are rushing to finalize their accounts, and credit is tight. On the one hand, the bureau's efforts to maintain people's livelihoods and stabilize prices have been effective. Both hot red stocks and public bonds have declined, and interbank interest rates have risen to 20%. The prices of daily necessities such as rice, coal, and daily necessities have fallen. The Rice Control Committee decided to increase the amount of rice rations per household from this month, restoring the previous situation of three rations per month, with two liters of rice per person per ration. There is a large supply of coal, so people's hearts are greatly stabilized.</p>

<h3>The Life of Major General Shibasaki</h3>
<p>Major General Keiji Shibasaki, who led 4,500 Japanese naval landing forces defending Tarawa and Makin Islands, died a heroic death on November 25th last year. This spirit of complete self-sacrifice is worthy of eternal remembrance. This article introduces the life and deeds of Major General Shibasaki.</p>
<p>Born on April 9th, Meiji 27 (Western calendar 1894), as the sixth son of Hirohachi Shibasaki, a non-salaried nobleman. This was Major General Keiji Shibasaki. His family was wealthy, having been involved in agriculture and finance for generations. In Kamihigashijo Village, his family was one of the most prominent. In a sense, the Major General was perhaps fortunate, but he was not raised in pampered comfort.</p>
<p>The young Keiji was forged into a strong body through the strict teaching of his father, Sekihachi, and the loving care of his mother, Kusu.</p>
<p>"Although he was a mischievous and disobedient child, he was definitely not an unruly child." In the memories of his nephew, Kanosuke Shibasaki, there is also a faint suggestion of the energetic fighting spirit of young Keiji. Before entering elementary school, he never played with the children in the neighborhood, but once he started school, he suddenly became a "social butterfly", noticed and loved by all his classmates.</p>
<p>With an innate handsome appearance and the upright character inherited from his parents, he often looked down on those who were weak and decadent. Just as the Russo-Japanese War had just ended, during the Meiji era, the games that children loved most, such as "forming ranks" and "battles," were where he showed his skills. Especially during school breaks or after school, this handsome young man Keiji was always the protagonist in extracurricular games. Even when his energy was exhausted, he would not give in. As for his studies, he was of course unwilling to fall behind and was always at the top of his class.</p>
<p>Elementary School Life</p>
<p>His only confidant during elementary school, Ichitaro Yamamoto (49 years old), the current vice-chief of Kamihigashijo Village, recalled the past, saying: "His Excellency was always unusually energetic in games, and he was the protagonist among his classmates. But in academics, he was also an ambitious person who never admitted defeat. Whether in academics or sports, once he started something, he would definitely see it through to the end. That's the kind of character he had."</p>
<p>His father often said to him, "Don't think about getting rich and famous in your childhood. If you accumulate too much money, you won't become a great person."</p>
<p>However, his father entrusted the family's special assets early on to the young Keiji: 5,000 yen in savings and 1 cho 2 tan bu (approximately 110 ares) of land and mountains. The young Keiji was one of the outstanding talents in the village. In April 1907, he entered the Hyogo Prefectural Ono Middle School with excellent grades.</p>
<p>Middle School Life</p>
<p>After graduating from elementary school in his hometown with excellent grades, the young Shibasaki entered Hyogo Prefectural Ono Middle School in April 1907. Ono Middle School, established by taking over the domain school of a former feudal lord, was the only prefectural middle school in the eastern Harima region at the time. The location was quiet, and the school spirit was simple, so children from prominent families in Himeji and Akashi all gathered here.</p>
<p>Ono Middle School was four ri (approximately 12 kilometers) away from young Shibasaki's hometown of Kamihigashijo Village. If it were now, he could of course ride a bicycle or take some other kind of vehicle to school every day. However, at that time, when transportation was inconvenient, anyone who lived more than eight kilometers away was a boarder. Therefore, young Shibasaki also moved into the middle school dormitory, bathed in the clear waters of the Kakogawa River, and spent five years of middle school life. Before he knew it, he had absorbed the spirit of Ono Middle School, the "Dragonfly Spirit." After entering middle school, the impression that young Shibasaki gave to people was that of being loyal and vigorous. In academics and sports, he was a model student who excelled in both. This was unanimously praised by his classmates at the time. In addition, he was skilled in sports such as kendo, judo, tennis, and gymnastics. He studied kendo under the former feudal warrior and instructor, Mr. Nagamoto. He was always the first to arrive for winter training and was the most outstanding. According to reports from the front lines before his heroic sacrifice on Gilbert Island, he built a tennis court on the island to encourage the soldiers to exercise. In middle school, tennis was his favorite game. Whenever he had free time, he would compete with his classmates on the tennis court next to the dormitory. So, what motivated young Shibasaki to join the navy? The clear stream of the Kakogawa River, combined with the elegant plains and wilderness, was the place where warlords fought for hegemony during the Warring States period and was also the base from which Toyotomi Hideyoshi conquered China (the name of a region in mainland Japan). He often heard these kinds of local stories, which aroused his yearning and admiration for soldiers in his young heart.</p>
<p>In addition, the field exercises of the Himeji Division soldiers often appeared before young Shibasaki's eyes. Moreover, the Aono Plain nearby had excellent training grounds, so soldiers from various places often gathered there. Their imposing and heroic appearance often flashed through young Shibasaki's mind. In particular, Major General Ono Kyakushin, the brigade commander of Himeji, and Lieutenant General Tsuchiya Mitsuharu, the division commander of Zentsuji, often rode alone, demonstrating the heroic posture of generals on horseback, visiting the area. Thus, a mark of admiration for soldiers was deeply engraved on the minds of the middle school students. Not long after the Russo-Japanese War, a kind of short-tongued student cap that imitated military officer caps became very popular among the students of Ono Middle School. This was also a manifestation of their admiration for military officers. If young Shibasaki had continued to develop this mindset, it would of course have prompted him to join the army. However, in his second year, Kobe held a grand naval review, and he personally saw the elite of the Imperial Japanese Navy, such as the Mikasa battleship, which made him determined to join the navy. According to the recollection of Mr. Gunji Maeda, a former director of the Ono Middle School Dragonfly Association and a classmate of Major General Shibasaki, at that time, 300 students, led by Principal Noseta, traveled to school early in the morning, walked 16 kilometers to Tsuchiyama, and then took a train to Kobe, staying in various temples. The original plan was to watch the naval review from a flat-bottomed boat towed by a motorboat, but at that time, it was the capricious month of November, and the sea was rough along the way, so many of the students who grew up in the mountains became seasick, and as a result, they returned halfway in disappointment. Although it is not clear whether young Shibasaki was also seasick at the time, it was almost inevitable at the time.</p>
<p>The next day, they had to view the majesty of the Imperial Japanese Navy from land. Due to a slight change in the weather, the original intention was abandoned, which was a great disgrace for Japanese men from a maritime nation. The teachers also specifically talked about the importance of the navy to Japan, which further strengthened his determination to join the navy. From then on, young Shibasaki studied desperately and rested to break the past naval records as his only goal. In order to exercise hard to strengthen his body and mind, he didn't even wear underwear in the piercing wind. Regarding academics, he would thoroughly solve one problem before starting to study another. This spirit of perseverance was truly admirable. Usually, it was not uncommon for him to work until one or two o'clock in the morning. In his third year, General Tsuchiya Mitsuharu came to the school to visit and told me many stories about the "prosperity of Prussia." He said that the prosperity of the country depends entirely on military strength. Thus, the general's words, even every single word, were deeply imprinted on young Shibasaki's heart.</p>
<p>When Shibasaki entered the dormitory, Lieutenant General Takarotaro Iwai (who was a fifth-year senior student at the time), who also died at the hands of the American army in the South Seas, was the room leader, and he received much guidance from this senior. But when young Shibasaki became a senior student, he was also elected as the room leader. Principal Noseta was absolutely strict with the school's atmosphere and discipline. Anyone who violated the school rules or had poor grades was ordered to withdraw from the school, and sometimes they were demoted. Each year, there were about 90 students in a class, but only about 30 students remained at graduation, which was already a common occurrence. But when young Shibasaki was elected as the room leader, he always reprimanded the students who didn't know what was good for them, saying: "Students should act like students, and you must keep to your own duty." Because he himself was a man of few words but many actions, all the students in the dormitory listened to the words of room leader Shibasaki, who was so diligent in studying and resting. Thus, young Shibasaki became the driving force of the entire school. Although he was a strict room leader, when he returned home on Saturdays, because his family was a sake brewer at the time, he never forgot to bring back rice cakes made from sake rice for all the students in the dormitory to eat when he returned to school on Sunday nights. In this way, he was also a very emotional young man.</p>
<p>Naval Academy Era</p>
<p>The Naval Academy at that time was gathering talented students from all over the country. It could truly be said that there were many talented people. As for the excellent students who graduated from rural middle schools, "I must bring some glory to everyone," so he participated in the entrance exam. He boldly broke through the difficult entrance exam, which really brought glory to Ono Middle School. At the same time, the elders of the village considered him a genius. This naval student, Major General Shibasaki, who devoted himself to both literary and military pursuits in the beautiful natural surroundings of Etajima, quickly made a name for himself soon after entering the school. In his dignified and imposing physique, he was also in an excellent academic environment that cultivated talents and strengthened character, and he was also guided by senior instructors who were both kind and strict. Thus, his innate qualities were further developed and expanded.</p>
<p>His grades at the school, like in the past, were always at the top. Even the praise from his classmates, "What a smart guy," shows how good his grades were. He not only had superhuman intelligence but also an indomitable perseverance. He can truly be said to be a person of both intelligence and courage. The Major General was born with outstanding talents and worked hard himself. He knew how to hone his skills, so it can be said that he added flowers to the brocade and was an unparalleled talent. He not only had a strong physique but also quick and decisive talent. He was proficient in kendo, judo, archery, sumo, etc. Even during the two or three hours he spent returning home to visit his family, he would run to the backyard to clean up the archery range and practice archery diligently and silently by himself. The Major General was especially feared for his mountain-pressing style in kendo.</p>
<p>After spending three years in Etajima like this, his indomitable and hard-working spirit helped Shibasaki develop the qualities of a military commander with both literary and military skills.</p>
<p>The Major General never showed any signs of fatigue in guiding his juniors. While he was studying at the Naval Academy, he returned to his alma mater, Ono Middle School, to visit and brought many photos of life in Etajima and actual combat photos of the Great Japanese Army's occupation of Shanghai to the school. However, now, only these sad relics are preserved at the school, and the Major General died at the hands of the enemy. All the young people in the village are willing to follow in the footsteps of the Major General, following the blood of the martyrs, and kill the enemy. In his later years, the Major General served as an instructor at the Naval Academy. Mr. Kenzo Kobayashi, a famous naval professor who also served as an instructor, said the following about the Major General's character. "He was a very calm and indifferent person and never scolded students casually. I always wanted to imitate this attitude. Perhaps his heart was burning like a flame. During his time as an instructor, he had a son who died, but his grief never showed on his face. If someone offered condolences, he would only reply that he himself was weak and unable to bear it, and then he would immediately return to normal. I repeat, people who don't like to talk much will do amazing things when it comes to a critical moment. In ordinary times, the Major General didn't look like a great man at all. Even his admiration for Daikokuten (Kusunoki Masashige) and the fact that he was a martial arts master, I wouldn't have known if I hadn't read the newspaper."</p>
<p>In his later years, he served as an aide-de-camp, staff officer, and commander. There was no position that he was not able to perform happily, and he demonstrated decisive skills. It cannot be denied that this foundation was laid in Etajima. Even in the end, on a small island in the South Seas, he ambushed an enemy more than ten times his size, engaged in a decisive battle to the death, and charged in hand-to-hand combat, finally dying heroically and becoming a protector of the Great Japanese Empire. This could only be cultivated in the life of Etajima. Now, at a time when the flames of war in the Pacific are becoming more and more intense, he was able to die in battle and fully demonstrate the traditional spirit of the Marine Corps. While praising the Major General's immortal merits, we must also unite the sincerity of 100 million people to (Asahi Shimbun, 15th)</p>

<h3>A Lonely Story</h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>The wind roared angrily outside, just whooshing, whooshing, as if devouring everything in the world. There were no stars in the sky, nor a moon, just a thick, gray-black expanse.</p>
<p>Finally, it gradually darkened, like the face of an old man covered with white spots. It gradually became indistinguishable in this darkness.</p>
<p>"Click," Old Wang struck a match and lit the oil lamp. A faint yellow light filled the small room, often mixed with a nauseating oily smell.</p>
<p>Old Wu straightened his loose chest clothes and then, very skillfully, pulled out a smoking pipe less than two feet long from his chest. He squinted his eyes at the faint yellow light and started smoking, as if immersed in deep thought. White smoke puffed out of his mouth, mouthful by mouthful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes and looked at me, as if only now realizing that there was another person, me.</p>
<p>"It's very cold, isn't it? Little kid," he said to me kindly, and then blew out another puff of smoke.</p>
<p>"And very lonely," I said to him in a lonely tone.</p>
<p>"Oh, you understand loneliness too. Good, I'll tell you a lonely story now."</p>
<p>"That was a long, long time ago, in a winter when I was in my twenties. Look, I'm already fifty-eight years old this year, wasn't that a long, long time ago?"</p>
<p>"In the North, the weather is even more frighteningly cold. Riding on a horse along the winding mountain road, the wind is like a blade, scraping across your face. Does it hurt? Actually, it's already hurting so much that you've lost all feeling."</p>
<p>"The sand and stones outside the Great Wall are also blown over by the wind. Wherever there's wind, there's also dust. Needless to say, your face is already covered with a thick layer."</p>
<p>"Clear snot constantly drips down. It's too cold to bother wiping it away, so you just let it flow. Then the dust comes and forms two straight, chain-like streaks hanging down from your upper lip."</p>
<p>"But I wasn't afraid of the cold. When I was twenty years old, I was a strong young man. Haha, when I stretched out my arms, my biceps were as big as a fist. Cold? What's cold? But it's useless now, I'm old, now it's your world."</p>
<p>"At that time, I was in the North, working in a yamen, as a messenger who delivered official documents. Riding on horseback, with the document bag slung across my back. Thinking about it now, it was very... "</p>
<p>"One day, it was an extremely cold winter day, but I was still sweating. Even my horse was sweating on its cheeks."</p>
<p>"I kept whipping the horse, urging it to run forward. My heart was as anxious as an ant crawling on a red-hot iron pot because it was getting dark and I still had to travel fifty li to get to the place where I needed to deliver the documents. But the sky was gradually darkening, and the sky was a thick, gray-black expanse. But it didn't know my anxious mood, especially since I was carrying a document on my back that the master had told me to handle with the utmost care."</p>
<p>"Finally, it got dark. Riding on horseback, I kept thinking about what the master had told me in the morning about bandits often appearing on this road."</p>
<p>"At this moment, I was afraid. In such pitch-black darkness, there were no stars in the sky, nor a moon. For the howling of the wind and the startled flight of the night birds, I always thought that more than a dozen robbers were standing out of the darkness, ready to use force against me."</p>
<p>"But nothing happened until I stopped at a small inn halfway up the mountain. Although I was only thirty li away from the place I needed to reach, I no longer had the courage to continue forward. Even thinking about it now, it was a terrifying thing to be riding on horseback alone on a dark mountain road, with no stars, no moon, at night."</p>
<p>"I washed my face with a basin of water and called the innkeeper to bring another basin, but the water turned black almost immediately. Wow, my face was really covered in ash. I didn't bother calling for another basin."</p>
<p>"Alone with an oil lamp, it was really lonely. Didn't you say you're lonely now? But this doesn't count for anything. That day, I was really lonely."</p>
<p>"The light gradually dimmed. I turned it up a little, but it soon dimmed again. It turned out that there was no more oil in the lamp. I called the innkeeper, but he was fast asleep. After calling for a long time, he woke up, filled the lamp with oil, and also brought a bottle of wine and a bowl of snacks to go with it. So, I started drinking alone. Everyone in the inn was fast asleep, only I was drinking wine by myself under the dim light. How..."</p>
<p>"The wine gradually ran out, so I prepared to go to sleep too. But I couldn't fall asleep, no matter what. Was it due to the excessive fatigue of the journey or the intense stimulation after drinking? I don't know."</p>
<p>"I just stared at the papered wall and saw mice running across my bed. At this time, outside the house, the wind was roaring, just like today, just whooshing, whooshing, as if it wanted to devour everything in the world."</p>
<p>"Under the dim yellow light, I was completely lost in deep thought!" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Fortune Teller</h3>
<p>— Zhao Yang</p>
<p>In a corner of the bustling city, in a place that is not very noticeable, a blind old man, like a dead tree branch, sits there alone.</p>
<p>The small, broken, low wooden stool has been his seat for more than a dozen years. The days, rusted as if they are, pass by day by day.</p>
<p>Who knows what kind of person he is? Does he have sons? Maybe...</p>
<p>He tightly closed his dull eyes, feebly, mysteriously, shaking a pair of weathered wooden cylinders. The four characters on them - "Divine Class for Women's Life" - have changed from vermilion to gray-black, and some of the "divine marks" have been polished to a shine by his hands.</p>
<p>His viscous saliva flowed from his wrinkled mouth, advertising his business to passersby: "Divination for travel directions, lost people, marriage, no accuracy, no money..."</p>
<p>But from morning to night, not a single person would come to find him. He fumbled for the few corner bills and a hungry belly in his torn pocket: "Should I buy a sesame seed cake to eat?...”</p>
<p>"Alas, what kind of fate is this? Let me divine for myself!"</p>
<p>Thinking this, he devoutly shook the wooden cylinders. The small bamboo sticks vibrated, and he used his trembling right hand to reach in and touch some of his old friends:</p>
<p>"Sixty-sixth Sign, Lower, Lower: This sign is ominous for the master."</p>
<p>"Major misfortune, major misfortune, alas, unlucky things!"</p>
<p>He quickly threw his old friends back in, tears streaming from the corners of his eyes, dripping onto his clothes...</p>
<p>Several days passed.</p>
<p>Still, in that not-so-noticeable place, the fortune teller lay there, covered by a torn mat. Tears would no longer flow from the corners of his eyes. A fly was resting on his feet, rubbing them. The broken cylinder also lay beside him...</p>

<h3>Football League First Round - Tung Wah Football Club Completes Championship - Police and Portuguese Businessmen Were Very Determined</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Football League, although there are still a few matches left in the first round, after Tung Wah Football Club defeated Kiangwan Joint Association last Monday (the 3rd), it completed its championship with six wins in six games in the first round. Just waiting for the labor points in the first round. Here is a review and commentary on the matches of the previous two days. Let's start with the match at Yih Garden yesterday morning. The Chinese giant, Luen Yee Football Club, faced the Portuguese businessmen. The Portuguese businessmen had requested a change of schedule because several official team members had to serve in the air defense exercises that day. However, the request was not approved by the authorities, so they put together a team with second-team members, Spice, and reserve players. On the other hand, Luen Yee Football Club had a full team. From this perspective, Luen Yee Football Club was certain to win. However, the opposite happened, so I would like to comment:</p>
<p>Poor Roster Adjustment - Luen Yee Football Club Made a Big Mistake</p>
<p>Due to the lack of talent on the left wing, Luen Yee Football Club tried Qu Yongfu in that position in this match, and made a big mistake by putting Cai Shengmiao in the center back line. Qu has served as the center back line with Song and Zheng, responding in unison and once being considered the best defense line in East Asia. Although that's an overstatement, they were still considered a standard center back line. Later, with Cai taking over the position, the response was not effective, and the center line was broken. How could they attack? Moreover, Qu's attempt at left wing was unsuccessful. This was not his fault but a mistake in scheduling. In the second half, they restored the original roster, which showed improvement. Finally, Li Yichen was not in his element on the front line, so he switched with Wu Qixiang, which led to a comeback victory. This showed adapting to reality and being able to respond to the situation. Without this, it would not have been successful. Individually, Wu Qixiang was the most outstanding. As a defender, he was all-around and had no loopholes. As a midfielder, he was able to break through the defense. It was not easy to win in the end. Secondly, Xu Wenkui's footwork was skillful and clear, which was commendable. It's a pity that a good flower has no supporting leaves, so he was out of place. Yu Zhenyue scored after 35 minutes in the first half, when Gao Baozheng, in the crowd, received a pass from Li Zaichen. Five minutes later, the Portuguese businessmen's left scored from a corner kick by Bao Hugh. Both were tied.</p>
<p>In the second half, at 20 minutes, Prada advanced on the right wing, and Liu Xianhan was helpless. The Portuguese businessmen took the lead with two goals to one. Luen Yee Football Club, having won first and then lost, refused to give up, so Wu Qixiang and Li Yichen switched positions. Wu Qixiang lived up to expectations, breaking through the defense and returning with success. With only ten minutes left in the game, Luen Yee Football Club's luck turned around. Yu Zhenyue was inspired and scored off a pass from Gao Baozheng. Luen Yee Football Club was able to win narrowly with three goals to two. It was extremely dangerous!</p>
<p>Volunteers Joined Kiangwan Joint Association - The Audience Was Greatly Disappointed</p>
<p>The match between Kiangwan Joint Association and the police last Saturday afternoon at 3:30 PM in Kiaochow Park was a scene from the second round of the Football League. Nine volunteers from Kiangwan Joint Association participated in the battle, which was eagerly anticipated. Kiaochow Park was crowded with people, and the atmosphere was no less lively than other important matches. However, the police won a major victory with five goals to one. The one goal scored by Kiangwan Joint Association was also a penalty kick. Kiangwan Joint Association was so battered and exhausted that the fans who supported them sighed. The police team maintained its consistent style, attacking and defending well. However, they didn't show any particularly outstanding performance. Only goalkeeper Punik showed improvement and progress. This shows that things depend on people, and there's only concern about not striving for improvement. Kiangwan Joint Association's goalkeeper, McNeety, missed three saves in a row, and his luck ran out. Vella DiBanna on both wings was slow and ineffective! The whole team advanced slowly like snails. What can they achieve? If they don't seek physical activity again, the future of the volunteers is unimaginable. Police striker Robert Stoff was still the soul of the team, and Ampulaev, who occasionally appeared, unexpectedly scored the first and third goals, which was due to good luck. It was also the result of hard work. Center backs Mikhailov and Yu Lihua were willing to run and compete, assisting the front and taking care of the back, which was commendable.</p>
<p>In the first half, the police scored two goals within 20 minutes, becoming invincible. McNeety left the field due to injury.</p>
<p>In the second half, Little Yellow Hair scored the fourth goal, and Rodi was slightly injured. Then, Luo Xulai committed a handball penalty, which Salati converted, breaking the duck egg record. Before leaving, Little Yellow Hair scored another goal, making it five to one. The police returned triumphantly. The score was the same as the first round. (Mei Jie)</p>
<h3>West Tsing Jia Group Situation Clarified - Hua Lian Pharmacy Can Always Win - Oriental Giants Follow Behind</h3>
<p>This magazine has systematically recorded the West Tsing Basketball Jia Group competition. Due to space limitations and temporary stops, the previous two issues were not published. Here is a table of the current situation, followed by a brief review of the matches of the past two weeks for the reference of fans.</p>
<p>On the night of the 20th of last month, Shantou team won over San Shu, and Oriental lost to Ta Hua, which was in line with the strength of the teams. The battle process was plain and unremarkable. But the two battles on the evening of the 22nd were unexpected. Hua Nan's defeat by Monnak was all due to bad luck, not a war crime. Hua Ying's loss to San Lun had two reasons: first, Hua Ying's guidance was inadequate, advocating more chaos, and second, San Lun's Dong Chun Chuan Xiang Rui came in succession, resulting in Hua Ying's crushing defeat. The 25th was a rest day. On the evening of the 27th, the Giants captured Ren Yu, who lacked shooting talent, which was their fatal flaw. The Giants are normal, with little progress but no decline, maintaining a normal team. Oriental rejected Nak, which was quite thrilling. Fortunately, Xu Wenkui was spiritual, hitting all his shots, and Bao Songyuan worked hard both inside and outside. The young players could not stand it. In another game, Ta Hua resisted the Giants, and although they lost, they were able to outwit their opponents.</p>
<p>Last Week's Battle</p>
<p>Shantou team beat Tong Ren, which was the battle on the night of the 3rd. According to the Shantou team, the young generation is doing well, and the reporter has repeatedly encouraged them. However, judging from this battle, the generals have not made progress, and they are also arrogant. Chen Qingjiang and Chen Guang prefer to play tricks, which is why they have not reached the peak. Some say this is a phenomenon in the process; now I hope to improve it as soon as possible, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve great things. Tong Ren team misunderstood Zhang Banglun, and the five Xuan brothers were serious to the end, doing their best to show their skills. Except for their slightly poor physical strength, there is no flaw to attack. Victory or defeat is not counted. The score was fifty-seven to forty-two, Shantou team won.</p>
<p>For the rest of the game, Ta Hua requested - a change of schedule. - The first game of the A group battle on the 5th. The former military spirit was scattered, so I don't need to criticize it too much!</p>
<p>At the end, Hua Ying defeated Tong Ren, which everyone said was a upset, but it was not. Before, Hua Ying had also defeated Tong Ren in the Paramount, because the two teams had the same skills. And Hua Ying is taller. Tong Ren is the opposite. This victory or defeat is based on the fact that Hua Ying's Qian came to the scene in an orderly manner, which boosted the military's morale. This is another reason for the victory. Forty-five to thirty-eight, Xiang is in the ideal state with seven points.</p>
<p>In the two battles on the 7th, Hua Nan faced Amateur, and the latter requested another change of schedule. They abandoned their rights the night before. This time, they changed the schedule again. Is there any compelling reason?</p>
<p>Hua Lian Pharmacy won Monnak in overtime. In this battle, Hua Lian Pharmacy was able to cheer up at first, but then became chaotic. Kong Guangyi was too angry, Xi Xilin was too fancy, and Zhang Jin liked to play tricks, all of which should be changed. Monnak also relied on his familiarity with the territory, skillful shooting, and sufficient energy, and the more he fought, the more courageous he became. It is a capable team. The statutory time was twenty-nine to twenty-nine, which shows how tight the process was. In the five-minute extension, Hua Lian Pharmacy won by seven! One win, the total ended at thirty-six to thirty. Hua Lian Pharmacy maintained a constant victory (Bi Xian)</p>
