<p>社評</p>
<h3>中等教育的當前問題</h3>
<p>戰後問題已成爲今日全世界遠見人士關心研究的中心問題，而如何培養我們的下一代的問題，實爲戰後問題的先決問題之一，因此我們對於中國教育的當前問題非特別注意不可。本報會於日前舉行大學教授座談會並撰評討論，茲更召集中等教育座談會，集本市各中學校實際負責教導的諸位先生於一堂，暢談現狀與發抒理想（參閱今日本報第三版座談會紀錄），深信對於本市中等教育前途，一定有所裨益。我們在這裹尚須補充座談會結論，而期待於今後教育當局及教育界者有如下幾點：　　目前中等教育最大的問題，首先還是執教人員的生活過於艱苦問題。由於中學教師生活過於艱苦，發生了三種現象：○中學教師改業，造成優良師資缺乏；○在教導工作之外兼謀業外收益，致未能專心於本職；○優良師資難得，以致有標準降低的現象。所以改善中學教師生活實爲最迫切的問題。座談會的結論，是希望當局設法補助，學校經濟公開，改善教師待遇，提倡導師運動及與論界協力等等，都很具體。現在當局對教育人員已有特種配給制度及教育保險等辦法，我們希望切實的速付實施。同時希望：○學校當局切實實施經濟公開，勿貽學店之譏。○教員間成立自己的組織，協謀互助。○教員應改善自己的生活，努力於進修，且勿抱殘守闕，自滿自足的心理，而成爲時代的落伍者。　　目前中等教育的第二個大問題是青年失學問題，由於學費雜費書費的驚人飛漲，已經成爲一股薪水階級子弟教育上的重大壓力，實足以阻碍中等教育的發展。所以一方面固然希望教育費用之合理的調整，一方面特別有待於助學運動的啓示，是頗可欣慰的。我們所必須鄭重指出的是：○關於核准標準問題，我們必須從我國教育現狀及國家民族今後需要而定，大中小學，均不宜有所偏倚。原則上大學當特別注重實科，中學以下則當盡量增加助學員額，使更多青年有受教育機會，特別着重於[清寒]二字；但是，○在核准標準方面，我們究竟也不能忽視[優秀]二字，不過我們所指的[優秀]，決不僅着重助學教試的成績，同時必須注意其平時求學成績，品性及體格三者，而在學問方面，尤當注意於對於國家民族現實的認識，如果各科及格而對國家及社會的現實毫無認識，沒有健全的人生觀，也是將來新時代所不取的。○爲了推進助學運動，希望各校與助學金機關多多聯絡，互相協力促進，以收實效，庶幾一方面不辜負捐輸金錢者的美意，一方面可以對得住國家民族，確確實實替國家培養元氣作育人才。　　此次座談會上提出了戰後教育問題，是最可注意的問題。兩位孫先生的意見，似乎一致主張[人格教育爲體，科學教育爲用]，在原則上，我們當然可以贊同的。不過，我們以爲這是一個大問題，決不是一二次座談會所能確定的，我們熱烈希望關心國家民族前途及對教育有經騐有研究的專家們，多多發揮卓見，我們決定在可能範圍之內加以發表，公開討論研究，以求獲得更正確更符合眞理的結論和更積極更具體的方案。我們未來的時代，是獨立解放與復與建設的時代，對於這樣新時代的中等教育方案，應該是舊制度舊方法的澈底清算，我們一方面得發揮東方精神文明遺產，以改造整個學風，但一方面不忽視時代是只會前進的，我們必須站在科學的立塲迎頭趕上去！</p>
<h3>日八十五屆議會今午舉行閉幕式</h3>
<p>衆議院昨通過總力決勝案　　東京十一日中央社電　日本第八十五屆臨時議會，十一日爲議事之最後一日，是日貴族院於上午九時舉行預算總會，首由伍堂卓雄氏繼前日續行質疑，上午共有十一名，起立激勵政府決戰施策之推行，至晚，除總預算追加案外，並決議另外兩案，旋即舉行全體會，將之提出通過，至此議會提出之預算各案，完全按照政府原案由兩院通過成立。又衆議院亦自上午十時起舉行建議·請願兩委員會，並於下午一時舉行全體會議，最後並表明舉國一致擊滅英·美之決議，由山崎達之輔氏起立，辯明奉體聖旨決勝決意案後，在全塲必勝空氣中決定之，如斯五日以來之敵前議會遂告完畢，十二日舉行閉幕式。　　東京十一日中央社電　日八十五屆臨時議會，已定十二日上午十一時，於貴院全體會議議塲行閉院與體，是日，天皇不親臨，屆時小磯首相，陸·海各相，貴院副議長，衆院正·副議長及兩院議員齊集議塲，小磯首相恭讀勅書，貴院副議長敬謹接受，禮成散會。　　東京十一日中央社電　日本衆議院爲感謝開院式所賜勅語及鑒於此次議會使命之重大，乃於議會之最終日（十一日）提出聖旨奉戴決議案，小磯首相對此，代表政府表示謝意，并披瀝政府信賴國民決立於先頭，向決勝之途邁進。又翼政會方面，決以此項決議於會議後推行一大國民運動，茲誌其決議文如次：[戰局危急，皇國興廢之機已臨，我等奉戴聖旨，敢然趨先憤激，鞏固[億國民之團結，集中國家之總力於決勝之途，誓擊滅英·美，期安聖慮]。</p>
<h3>日勝田預算委長報告飛機增產</h3>
<p>農相說明食糧儲藏狀況　　東京十一日中央社電　日衆院十日全體會議中，勝田永吉豫算委員長報告：飛機之增產，爲此次議會主要課題，然政府當局在秘密會中，業已詳細說明今後之方針，完全了解，若依此方針與計劃進行，飛機之增產殊屬易事。前在秘密會議又會說明此項方針與前綫將兵之勇戰善門相應，在將來之決戰中，必能擊滅英美。　　東京十一日中央社電　日本島田農商相，十日於衆議院預算會，關於空襲時期下緊急食糧之儲藏狀況，答野口喜一氏之質問謂，食糧品之儲藏，現在京濱，名古屋，北九州，孤神及其他各重要地區實施，且對各地區之儲藏量早經決定，各地並樹立分散配置之方針，努力實行，所獲成績至佳，分散儲藏，乃爲供給非常時期之需要。又答覆森肇氏之質問，闡明本年稻作狀況，謂本年農作當初因受水旱災禍，頗爲憂慮，然最迫天氣轉佳，各地農作均極良好，可達往年之收成量，關於旱災，水災之緊急措置，此次已追加播種，且謀善後之處置。　　東京十一日中央社電　日大達內相於十日衆議院豫算總會席上，答辯野品氏關於人民防空之質問，謂全日疏散之定戶數，爲十二萬戶，現疏散者已達百分之七十六，東京，名古屋疏散數達最高點。人口疏散計劃，豫定爲六十萬人，東京疏散至六十三萬人，此後將以老幼爲中心，向其親友處疏散。關於建築物之疏散，大抵告竣，目下在間隔疏散中。</p>
<h3>巴莫代表聲明</h3>
<p>仰光十一日中央社電　緬甸國家代表巴莫，十日發表聲明如次：小磯首相閣下演說中，闡明最近即將承認東印獨立，此實基於大東亞共同宣方，建設大東亞機構最後基石之一，同時亦爲表現此次戰爭乃大東亞民族解放戰爭之關證，今後獲得自由之大東亞民族西方之緬甸，東方之菲律賓，南方之東印度，將負起防衛東亞門戶之重任，由於此種事實，敵人欲愚弄世界散佈之宣傳，已盡行暴露，現在大東亞民族之唯一任務，即吾人爲擁護自由與名譽，各民族應同生共死，小磯首相閣下所明示之方針，吾人將斷然恪守。</p>
<h3>日海軍表彰有功工廠</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日海軍艦政本部，十一日上午十時起，於艦政本部開會，舉行表彰式，以感謝狀授於有功於增產海軍兵器之今井研究所等工廠，按今井研究所會完成國產原料。</p>
<h3>中日堅密提携建設大東亞</h3>
<p>日小磯首相重要演詞　　東京十一日中央社電　日首相小磯氏，七日於第八十五屆議會席間發表施政演說，在泰國部之前段，尚有關於闡明中·日兩國間尖本道義精神，建設大東亞之演詞，該段係該演詞中之最重要者，茲特補誌如次：中·日兩國之關係，在同盟條約下益加鞏固，蓋日軍繼續在中國南北大陸勇敢奮門，迄今已七年餘，其間會致力驅逐英·美侵略勢力，使中國得由彼等百年來之壓迫中解放，進而謀根據道義精神建設大東亞，日本此種眞意，今已逐次浸透於中國民衆之間，而中·日提携亦因之而更趨緊密。</p>
<h3>從蘇聯歸來</h3>
<p>記者告別莫斯科時，跟着戰局推移，而爲首都市民的人心最關注的問題，爲商業食料品店，商業酒塲，百貨店的開業。四月十五日是俄國祭日中有名的柏斯哈祭之翌日，市中受經濟復興政策的影響，昔日宗教革命前祭告的空氣，不知不覺復活起來，成爲市民好奇心及希望之的的商業食料品店二十七八家，在莫斯科各主要街道，一齊開設得很熱鬧，作爲柏斯哈祭日的應時贈品，而立即掀動了市民的人心。傳聞開店的市民，跑在我們前面，在食料品店之前排成長蛇般的行列，出動許多巡警，整理人心狂熱的行列。</p>
<h3>難於置信的商品價格</h3>
<p>而看那裹陳列的物品，舉如肉類，蔬菜，罐頭，砂糖，糖果，麵包，酒類，水菓，烟草等等，我們日常必需的食料品，無不應有盡有。然而，那裹陳列的商品之價值，令人咋舌，例如砂糖每公斤八百盧布，麵包一千盧布，肉四百盧布左右，蛋糕每個五十盧布，蘋菓每個五十盧布，伏加酒每瓶二百盧布，葡萄酒每瓶三百盧布左右，白麵包每公斤百盧布左右。（盧布對日圓的兌換率，依外交團比率爲三十五圓六十錢）。現在蘇聯的勞働者，勤務員的每月平均工資如以四百盧布左右計算，則他們一個月的勞働價值，不過相等於肉一公斤，砂糖半公斤的價值。所以食品店的這種價格，大有將人當作糊塗蟲之感。難怪市民常　置地咒稱：[這商店是反宗教商店。他們所定的價格，眞令人難於置信。]　　下面是莫斯科市民的有趣談話：　　[昨天起各地開了很偉大的博物館，去看過嗎？]　　[還沒有去看過，究是何種博物館呢？]　　[那　好看極了。這樣珍稀的東西，以前人類或許還沒有嘗過，現在可以免費參觀了，快去見識一下吧!]　　新開店的熱鬧　　可是嘲罵儘管嘲罵，俄京的市民生活，卻因食品店的新開而顯得活氣了。手裹有一點錢的人，都想買些什麼。大家在生意眼上勾心門角。最大的食品店，一天的營業額，在開張那天約三千萬盧布，一個月後減低至三百萬盧布，但其數已相當可觀了。這種食品店開張後不久，大體與德蘇戰前同樣的塲所，商業酒塲也如雨後春筍般的出現了。　　而這也是市民們口中所說的[反宗教]酒塲。無論酒菜，價格非常高昂，客人們無論如何不會吃醉。湯每盆三十圓，牛肉餅每盆五十圓，葡萄酒一瓶百圓，稍微考究一點，就非一二千金不辦。因而客人們不能始終提心吊膽地且領且食，恐怕吃得不能付賬，雖聽着爵士音樂，心中有忐忑不定。恰如沒有爵士音樂時通夜奔走的感覺一樣。但胸前掛着二個英雄勳章的將校們，卻扶着二三女人同桌歡呼暢飲。然而他也常鬧得付不出賬，湊集熟識友人的錢來敷衍過去。一般大衆對這些地方總是難得光臨的。（翔：譯自八月二十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>渡甌江施行奇襲日軍佔領溫州</h3>
<p>完全粉碎敵美企圖　　東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午四時發表：浙省日軍由金華附近開始行動後，即分別擊潰該地渝軍，進攻甌江，並已於九日攻略溫州。　　日軍某基地十一日中央社電　浙南日軍攻佔麗水後，更沿甌江向海岸方面繼續挺進，排除渝新編第二十二·三十三兩師之抵抗，於九日上午九時，佔領溫州。　　廣州十一日中央社電　據重慶電，日軍現正猛攻麗水·溫州中間之青田，其他一部隊則自青田迂廻在青田東方十公裡之溫溪附近激戰中。　　東京十一日中央社電　浙省日軍於八月中旬，由浙贛鐵路沿綫金華附近開始行動後·即逐次擊潰顧祝同所部第三戰區渝軍，向南推進·於二十七日攻略該方面要衝麗水，着着準備次期作戰。該方面作戰態勢，於九月上旬完全整備後，乃開始進攻，卒於九日攻略浙省南部渝軍最大據點溫州。最近渝美又在由金華往麗水至溫州之公路兩旁山岳地帶，構築縱深陣地，以阻日軍進展，並繼續蠢動，擬遮斷日軍後方補給路，但終被日軍隨處擊潰，日軍並施行奇襲，渡過甌江，突然佔領之。按溫州係渝軍第三戰區及第七戰區之連絡基地，爲渝軍之重要軍事據點，同時亦係敵美所唾涎之地帶，蓋最近敵美顯係欲以該地作爲遮斷日南方運輸路之基地，乃至橋頭堡之策源地，以期呼應大陸作戰。惟由於日軍此次先發制人，攻略該地，故敵美此種企圖，已被粉碎於未然矣。</p>
<h3>怒江日軍展開果敢反擊戰</h3>
<p>怒江前綫十一日中央社電　日軍自衝破渝軍陣地，增強守備後，即對企圖包圍該地之第十一集團軍展開果敢之反擊戰·又前往解園之日增援軍之一部·會猛攻該地西北方構築陣地以圖阻止日軍前進之渝軍·刻正典守備部隊協力向渝軍前進陣地猛攻中。又攻略小松山陣地之日軍·目前正與渝軍激戰中。　　廣州十一日中央社電　怒江方面日軍，僅以寡兵邀擊渝美軍執拗之反擊，而予以重創，同時，於逐次增強兵力後，已轉爲反入作戰。渝軍事委員會九日特將截至八月五日止，渝美軍於北緬及怒江方面所蒙損失發表如次：○陣亡重慶軍四九八○名，英美軍一一六七名，總計六一四七名。○死傷重慶軍一一一七一名，英美軍二九二五名，統計一四○九六名。○失踪重慶軍三四八名，英美軍一三一，總計四七九名。</p>
<h3>日機急襲保山機塲</h3>
<p>緬甸日軍助綫基地十一日中央社電　緬甸日軍航空部隊戰門機隊·於八晶首急襲渝軍雲南遠征軍補給基地保山機塲·並予其運輸機及衛護之P38型戰門機九架，展開空戰。結果擊落其空軍機二架，Ｐ３８型機一架，並焚毀其地上運輸機一架，是役日機損失二架云。</p>

<h3>襲帛琉雅浦兩島敵機墜毀百餘架日航空部隊轟炸必阿克島</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地十一日電，美機動部隊於過去六·七·八三日間，出現於帛琉·雅浦兩島方面，實行砲擊轟炸，當地日軍即邀擊之，擊落敵機三十二架（內八架不確），擊破五十三架，並予其他以重大損失，預計戰果相當浩大。　　中部太平洋日軍基地十一日中央社電　十日敵戰門轟炸機三百五十架來襲帛琉羣島，當地日軍部隊奮勇迎擊，擊毀敵機十七架以上，日方損害輕微。　　東京十一日中央社電　據西南太平洋日軍某基地十一日電，日航空部隊於九日黎明，空襲必阿克島及其附近之敵飛機塲·軍事設施等，全彈均命中目標，各處發生大爆炸，並確認有十數處發生大火，是役日機亦有一架未返。</p>
<h3>日機隊襲成都作戰意義重大</h3>
<p>渝美空軍損失奇重　　東京十一日中央社電　此次駐渝美空軍Ｂ２９型機空襲南滿時，日機隊於除於鞍山上空及來歸途中迎擊外，並於是日喪半冒惡劣天氣，進攻其以成都機場爲中心之基地，而將返還不久之美機炸毀</p>
<h3>達四十架</h3>
<p>按日機此次獲得如此大戰果之經過，於美軍之Ｂ２９型軍編隊，自成都附近基地起飛時，即被日機隊偵知，當即於鄭州附近上空，對敵加以中途阻擊，結果擊毀其八架，內中四架着火向南方倉皇逃去。其次滿州方面，日機隊於</p>
<h3>鞍山上空</h3>
<p>又確實擊落其三架，擊毀其六架，嗣後中國方面，日機隊復於彰德附近，痛烈迎擊歸途中之敵機，計擊落其三架，內一架未證實，擊毀二架。更在追該遁走之機羣時，於泰安附近又擊毀一架。最後準備進擊成都附近之Ｂ２９型空軍基地，乃於八日夜半，遂冒惡劣天氣，排除敵戰門機之抵抗，</p>
<h3>大舉轟炸</h3>
<p>前行歸還之Ｂ２９型基地羣，即於九月三日半至四日之間，猛炸新津及彭山兩機塲，已獲得赫赫戰果。又其他一隊，會痛炸雙流，廣漢及中興機塲，於該方面因天氣關係，致不能確實判明戰果。另一方日機隊，於湖北老河口附近，忽偵知有Ｂ２９型機一架被迫着陸，當即進擊，未幾即將其焚毀。以上之激戰與進攻兩作戰之</p>
<h3>綜合戰果</h3>
<p>計擊落擊毀及焚毀敵機共達四十架，幾達敵機數之半數，敵之損失堪稱奇重。反之，日方損失於進擊時未歸還者僅二架，於作戰時犧牲四架，其餘皆安然返抵原防。按美軍爲襲擊日本土及南滿地方，於</p>

<h3>食用油登記的成績</h3>
<p>— 栗本寅治</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會油糧統制委員會，鑒於目前商業情態，爲明瞭上海特別市市民的重要民食之一食用油的消費狀態，及其現在情況起見，設定食用油現存數量並買賣的登記制度，於上月二十六日通知上海區食用油業同業公會的會員，即上海的油廠，食油販賣商（批發莊）零售商等，辦理登記。</p>
<h3>登記食油數量</h3>
<p>茲就其已登記者視其現存食油的登記內容，計向公會登記完畢者爲華方榨油廠四家，油坊二家全部登記，此外有販賣商一百四十一家，零售商三百三十五家。就其對業者的總數看來；榨油廠爲百分之一百，但其餘則不無爲數寥寥之感。但如更徵這於實際，則可確定約爲實際營業家數的百分之七。即販賣商二百七八十家會員中，繼續營業者約爲二百家。又零售商總數大致爲一千五六百家，但其三分之二以上均爲兼營食品，雜貨業者，貯藏的油糧極微，所以不成問題。蓋因食油零售專門業者僅五百家左右。今以之與上次各當局對日用品及米糧命令登記的結果，依市井的風傳而考察起來，則此次食油登記的成績，可稱頗爲良好。茲試看其登記數量，計榨油工廠現存五·○○○餘市擔,販賣商存儲二一·三○○餘市擔，零售商所有額九·八七○餘市擔，合計三萬六千二百餘市擔。　　今假定米糧每人每年的消費平均二市石，食油每人每年十市斤，則此次油的登記總數三萬六千二百餘市擔，正可謂爲等於米糧七十二萬四千市石的登記。</p>
<h3>自然節減消費</h3>
<p>又現在市民食油一個月的消費，實際約爲平均○·六市斤，巳自然而然地減少了消費。因而登記完畢的數量，維持一個半月，綽然有餘。加以未登記者估計尚有三成，約一萬二千担，此外，市民的家庭亦各備若干。何況食油的來源即使不便，缺乏，每月總可獲得若乾補充（估計三四百噸），依此看來，食油似不致成爲迫於眉睫的堅急關頭。然近來食用油的市價，較因電力節減問題而普遍上漲的其他物品更見加厲，其故何在？這不用說是金融資本家的囤積所致。防止此弊的實際效果，正在研究不甚損及業者利害的制止方策。乃有此次的棧單發行制度，業者保存現貨期間的限制及登記制度，統制委員會希望公布不使正當買賣交易發生極小弊害與不安的制度。</p>
<h3>從業員的協力</h3>
<p>幸承同業的諒解，而獲上述登記成績。這裹告訴我們假使不容業者有不當的暴利，對適當的利潤與當然的業務不酸成何種不便，而其處置不是無理的，大體上合理的，則有良心的從業者，不吝協力。換言之，因統制委員會的負責者是華方的業界領袖，且其幹部畢爲同業的熟悉者，故決不虐待我同業，亦不致阻碍正當貿易，而略感安心。這樣解釋，或許不是自稱自讚罷！總之，這誠然是可喜的事實。</p>

<p>本報爲討論一般教育改進方針，會於本月四日，首先舉行大學教育座談會，茲復於六日下午四時，假座工商聯誼會會議應，舉行中等教育座談會，出席者各中學教師范寶若，孫德餘，孫翔仲，徐甫，鞠清遠，阮賓華，朱蘊南，張貢粟，顧　嘉，孔敏中，陳天愚，林步基，徐鏡青，崔堅吾，馮振，李禦瀾，鄔鵬飛諸先生，仍由本報社會服務處主任黃警頑君主席，茲紀錄座談要點如下：　　黃警頑：今天承各位教師惠然蒞止，參加中等教育座談會，發表高見，不勝榮幸。教育是時代政治經濟的反映，學校是教育的主要發源地，而中等學校尤是決定教育前進的鎖　。講和君皆係對於中等教育富具經騐，對於當前中等教育問題，如何改進，如何興革，必具卓見，故特別舉中心問題數則，請諸位各抒宏論，幸甚。</p>
<h3>第一　改善教師生活問題</h3>
<p>黃警頑：現在請各位就[改善教師生活問題]，加以發揮，據最近報載，市政府方面，對教育界特別關懷，正準備實施教育人員特種配給制度，及教員保險制度，殊感興奮。同時本報亦有教職員補助金及醫藥助金的工作，以盡服務職志。陳天愚：要珍對教師生活，分兩方面講：○教師方面，教師影響於學生甚大，（一）教師應有以教育爲終身職業之志趣，（二）教師應具有卓異之學識，及專門的技能，（三）教師應有模範的品德。○學校方面，（一）物質方面，應儘量增高教師待遇，至少以保持健康爲度，（二）精神方面，學校不應視教師爲傭工，應使教師自認爲學校之中心，而鼓勵教師的精神，最好的措施，莫過於經濟公開，例如預支薪津，以安定生活，生活有了保障，精神自然得到安慰。孔敏中：談到教育問題，辦學校教育的人，固然要想辦法，最要緊的，應該政府當局同樣負起責任，現在政府對教育事業的努力，可算是最低限度的吧！崔堅吾：教育界同人，無論校長或教師，應該共同負責，同舟同濟，解決目前危機，務使[學店]的現象，不復存在於將來。范實若：關於教師生活問題，現在可得一結論：○希望教育當局及社會，對教育加以重視。○學校經濟公開，對教師待遇，儘量提高總收入的百分比，（至少應在百分之七十以上），特別對於年老退休的教職員，應當予以優卹。○提倡導師運動。○由輿論界依據事實，揭露教育界的黑暗。</p>
<h3>第二　助學運動的檢討</h3>
<p>黃警頑：敝報自舉辦助學金以來，已歷七屆，以清寒優秀健康爲甄別標準，承各校襄助，同人等衷心銘感，並希望學校對受助學生，嚴加教管，與敝報密切聯絡，如今對於助學運動的檢討，請各位多多發表意見。　　崔堅吾：貴報辦理助學金，自有優美之成績·然而錄取標準，擬請放寬，尤其對於確係清寒而成績稍差之學生，應予特別處理，以資救濟。　　范責若：甄別時，除採用考試法外，請參照學校平時成績，因一部份學生，臨時倉皇，心理失常，甄別成績不佳，以致落選者，往往有之。　　黃警頑：關於甄別標準，本報並非完全根據試騐，試騐不過是標準之一，除分數外，另外參照家境及在校成績，如遇在校成績尚佳或太差者，均鄭重處理，並極力避免投機取巧等企圖。關於這一點，尚請各校予以協助，現在請就救濟落選學生方面，發表高論。　　徐　甫：本校對助學金學生，領款不足，或未能核准者，特由師生創設助學金以資補救，下學期擬採取級會助學制度，使同學間發揮同情與互助之美德，務使無一人因不克担負學費而失學。　　孔敏中：中小學爲普通教育的基礎，中小學生爲數最多，故請貴報核准助學金之百分比，亦應對中小學生多多提高。至於本校對於助學運動的響應，除各級成績優秀學生前五名免費外，凡受各處助學金者，擇特別清苦者免費，而將助金退還。　　徐鏡青：本人以爲助學金應特別注重清寒，凡優秀而不清寒者，固不予核准，但清寒而成績稍差者，則應予以通融。本校對特別清苦之助金學生，除免費外，並退還所領得之助金，供其購置書藉文具。　　徐甫：關於減輕學生担負，本校實行借書制度，即由教師在高年級課堂上鼓勵學生，以所用舊書，借與下級學生，此法可供各校參考。　　范責君：歸納起來，可得四點，作爲今後助學運動之參考：○應注意平時成績。○核准標準應着重中小學生。○着重[清寒]二字甚於優秀。○請各校多設免費額，並與助學金機關多多聯絡</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<h3>第三　限制轉學以維持學生程度問題</h3>
<p>花骨警頑：辦理助學金以來，我們得到一點經騐，如今各級學生，轉學者爲數甚多，其中固有遷居關係或志趣不同等正當理由，然而一般學生，見異思遷者有之，越級　等者有之。要之，對學校及學生皆屬無利有害，均請各校，鄭重注意學生之轉學。　　范責若：關於轉學問題，限制或禁止·當然皆不可能，然應注意者，爲成績銜接，因爲往往有虛僞不實等現象，故除一紙文憑外，應嚴加考試，務使課業銜接，無越級　等之流弊。</p>
<h3>第四　中學生課外生活</h3>
<p>黃警頑：除以上學校內的教育問題外，我們感到學生校外或外生活有指導的必要。　　崔堅吾：關於學生課外生活，最要緊的，在於提倡正常娛樂。　　范責若：請貴凶多多鼓吹，加闢公共運動塲，作爲學生課餘遊憇之所，最好就地點適中，面積廣袤，如公園，跑馬廳等塲所開闢之。　　阮賓華：組織學生研究會，讀書會，演講會等，並由校方加以指導。　　孔繁中：我以爲以上各點，都可以包括於學校生活之內，此外還應提倡手工，音樂等課程，一方面陶治性情，一方面減少不正當之娛樂。除此以外，我以爲校外活動，還是愈少愈好。　　鄔鵬飛：本校一向注重德智體　四　，尤以體育爲最，特別着重生活指導，使學生不致脫　群衆生活，而成爲孤獨的書蟲。　　范貢若：在可能範圍內，請學校提倡並指導學生課外生活，儘量增加音樂手工等課程，或指定若干地方，作爲學生運動塲所。</p>
<h3>第五　戰後教育建設方針</h3>
<p>孫翔仲：目前教育趨勢，太重視功利主義，固可使青年學子，志願宏遠，然而功利主義的發展，促成物質的文明，物質愈發達，外物愈足以移人性情，結果　利縱慾主義，應之而起。我國自清末以來，一向太注重西洋文明，而將本國文化，反置諸腦後，故表面上社會活動，是如炎如荼的熟烈緊張，但究其內容，則是逐漸的銷沉下去。就教育立塲言，國民性逐漸墮落，所以欲挽回危機，最重要的是人本教育，所謂人本教育，就是每個國民，無論在心理生理各方面，都要有健全的發展，換句話說，就是提倡道德，提倡道德的功效，使每個青年都具有相生相養，相敬相愛，孝悌忠信等固有的本性，不致爲人慾橫流的社會習氣所朦蔽。在這一方面，目前中國的教育，無疑是失敗的，譬如許多大學生，往往連本國文字都不會利用，會寫鋼筆而不善用毛筆，其實這點距眞正的文明，眞是太遠了。一般學校，往往太注重分科，而忽略基本教育，原因是太重物質，而忽略精神，所以中小學教育界，最重要的責任，除去介紹西洋文明外，應該保存固有文化，發展青年的本性。我覺得一般學校，氣質普遍地低下，結果影響於學生者甚大，如果我們教育界，每人都能抱定宗旨，共同負起責任來，則學生自然會振作起來。我們不能隨世界轉移，我們要轉移世界，隨世界轉移，就是功利主義，轉移世界，就是人性文化，人類所以異於動物者在此，文明與野蠻的分野亦在此。譬如學生對教師，若僅有形式上的禮貌，及至時過境遷，視同陌路，此即功利主義之表現，但我們所需要的是本性教育，所以須教以人與人之關係，師與生之關係等等。這樣，雖不教以鞠躬行禮的形式，結果師生間自然會有密切的精神聯繫。　　目前社會的紛亂，政治不上軌道，無疑教育的失敗，政治與教育的關係，正如雞與蛋，蛋與雞，政治不良，則教育不易進步，教育不發展，則政治也不得上軌道，歷史造成我們，我們再造成下一代，世代相傳，更迭不巳，至於下一代的趨向，完全依目下教育界的努力而定，所以我們一方面應教育學生，另一方面更就注意社會與政治的動向，以精神的力量，肅清物質的慾望。　　孫德餘：剛才孫先生發揮宏論，給教育界的前途定明切的方針，然而我感覺到在實施上，第一須改善課程，目前中學生課外讀物的內容，實在太危險了，思想一經紛歧，改正非常不易，在小學時代，還是一片天眞，而中學校實可說是墮落的機關。古時我國的師道，包括傳道授業解文，而現今的教育則無一端能實行，反過來說，成爲賣鐘點的商店，教師不負責任，而學生方面，尊師崇道，更加談不到了，所以我主張改善課程，應多多介紹我國固有的文化。　　目前教師食不飽，力不足，時刻開心着生活問題，而學生也往往荒廢課業，注重金錢，徬徨歧路，養成心理的近視觀，然而中學教育的責任，不在大學小學之下。書曰[惟精惟一，允執厥中]，此中字亦可作中學之中字解，[楊子見歧途而哭之]，稍一不愼，即鑄大鑄大錯，所以我們應抱定遠大的眼光，改善課程內容，針對着[學非所用用非所學]之弊病，同時顧到身心的修養，其方法如週會記念週，即爲養心訓練之一種。此外更應多辦養務教育。　　范責若：以上承二位孫先生發揮切實而高深的崇論，就今後教育建設方針，給我們明朗的啓示，現在用一句話簡括起來，就是[人格教育爲體，科學教育爲用]。</p>
<h3>巫仁德先生節約捐助善舉</h3>
<p>揚州巫仁德先生，字道生，爲滬上金融實業界名流，中教道養會常務理事，平日孝友仁慈，篤信佛法，常懷飢溺猶已之心，時行節約濟人之事。茲又將節省麋費之資，慨助本報濟貧金曁各善團經費，以宏救濟成效，洵屬功德無量計開：中教道養總會冬賑施粥十八萬元，南市觀音庵妙眞老師太四萬元。明德節養會位中堂，中國佛教委刋社各二萬元。申報濟貧金，新聞報苦兒基金，上海時疫醫院，佛教同仁會，杭州節養庵念佛堂基金，各一萬元。靈隱法華精舍，慈聯救災會，淨業社慈善部，圓明大悲會，安養念佛堂，佛教濟寒會各五千元。以上總共三十四萬元，業已由巫君分別送去。</p>

<h3>雷雨</h3>
<p>那一天早晨，隆夫起得特別早，在盥漱室正在刷牙時，就聽到那個無線電的聲音了。　　[唔……]　　他因受到突然刺激，而把鋁製茶杯打落到地下了。自己跳了一下，而襪子都濕了，可是他完全都沒有注意到。　　[好，……好！]　　他所意識到的，只是這一點。片刻間，他的身體顫動起來了。當然這並不是恐怖使然。這是由於萬感交集，心頭和身體的全部躍動。過了一刻，頭低下了。他竟忘了自己而願向天祈禱。豆粒般大的淚珠，一棵一棵落到了床上。　　雖然如此，他是海軍省的職員，甚至一直到昨天下班時，也毫未知道一點消息。自然，不過一介軍屬的他，固然不想知道這樣發動戰爭的絕大機密，但只是覺得奇怪。到了今天才明白，實際上猜想一下或者能知道，反來看課內空氣，無論　昨天前天，都照常一樣，毫無變化。　　（眞是令人佩服！）　　隆夫並不因軍屬而悲傷，反而深深感覺到海軍的統制力了。西洋人所說的[沈默的海軍]，現在完全體騐到了。　　他急忙洗臉，回房間去穿西裝。按畫家的工作性質說，每天總是近午時才上班，然而今天卻在房間裹呆不住。　　從木屣箱裹拿出鞋來，老板穿着睡衣出來說　　[終於開火了!]　　這位老板總是講錢的人，平常非常卑鄙齷齪，可是這一天的面孔，浮現出清朗而令人感動的神情。　　[開火了……眞令人痛快！]　　隆夫穿上鞋，就一步跳到外面去了。　　雖然走到每天吃早點的飯館去了，但肚皮覺得不餓，一點也不想吃東西。如果是軍人，或許在這種塲合毫不在乎地仍然大吃大嚼，然而自己卻覺着不吃也沒關係。　　在省綫電車裹的客人，都有與昨日完全不同的表情。沒有一個人在讀報紙。這一天的晨報，從來沒有這樣賣的快，早已完全賣光了。　　隆夫好像忘記了一件很重要的東西一樣，而聯想到了眞人。　　（眞人一定很高興！那末他究竟在什麼地方呢？如果空軍將校，或許眞人一定被派到第一綫，然而眞人是海軍……）　　電車在四谷驛站住了。他爲了公共汽車，而就跑上台階。（一四○）</p>

<h3>Current Problems in Secondary Education</h3>
<p>Post-war issues have become the central concern of far-sighted individuals worldwide. The question of how to nurture our next generation is one of the prerequisites for addressing these post-war challenges. Therefore, we must pay special attention to the current problems in Chinese education. Our newspaper held a symposium with university professors and published discussions on this topic some days ago. Now, we are convening a secondary education symposium, gathering teachers from various secondary schools in the city to frankly discuss the current situation and express their ideals (see today's newspaper, page 3, for symposium records). We firmly believe that this will benefit the future of secondary education in our city. Here, we need to supplement the symposium's conclusions and express the following expectations for education authorities and the education sector in the future: The biggest problem currently facing secondary education is the excessively difficult living conditions of teaching staff. Due to the hardships faced by secondary school teachers, three phenomena have emerged: ○ Secondary school teachers change professions, leading to a shortage of excellent teachers; ○ They seek additional income outside of teaching, making it impossible to focus on their primary duties; ○ Excellent teachers are hard to find, leading to a lowering of standards. Therefore, improving the lives of secondary school teachers is the most pressing issue. The symposium concluded with the hope that the authorities would find ways to provide subsidies, make school finances transparent, improve teacher salaries, promote mentorship programs, and cooperate with public opinion, all of which are very concrete suggestions. The authorities already have special rationing systems and educational insurance for education personnel, and we hope for their prompt and effective implementation. We also hope that: ○ School authorities will genuinely implement financial transparency to avoid being ridiculed as "academic shops." ○ Teachers will form their own organizations to cooperate and assist each other. ○ Teachers should improve their own lives, strive for further education, and avoid clinging to old ways, becoming complacent, and falling behind the times. The second major problem in secondary education is the issue of youth dropping out of school. Due to the alarming increase in tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book costs, a significant pressure has been placed on the education of children from salaried families, hindering the development of secondary education. Therefore, while hoping for a reasonable adjustment of education costs, there is a particular need for the inspiration of scholarship assistance programs, which is quite gratifying. What we must solemnly point out is: ○ Regarding the issue of approval standards, we must base them on the current state of education in our country and the future needs of the nation and its people. There should be no bias towards universities, secondary schools, or primary schools. In principle, universities should especially focus on practical subjects, while secondary schools and below should increase the number of scholarship students as much as possible to provide more young people with educational opportunities, with particular emphasis on the words "[poor and needy]"; however, ○ In terms of approval standards, we ultimately cannot ignore the word "[excellent]". However, the "[excellent]" we refer to should not only focus on academic test scores, but also pay attention to their usual academic performance, character, and physical fitness. In terms of academics, special attention should be paid to their understanding of the reality of the nation and its people. If they pass all subjects but have no understanding of the reality of the country and society, and lack a sound outlook on life, they will not be accepted by the new era. ○ To promote scholarship programs, it is hoped that schools will increase contact with scholarship fund organizations and cooperate with each other to achieve practical results, so that on the one hand, they do not betray the good intentions of donors, and on the other hand, they can face the nation and its people, truly cultivating vitality and nurturing talents for the country. The issue of post-war education raised at this symposium is the most noteworthy. The opinions of the two Mr. Suns seem to consistently advocate "[character education as the foundation, scientific education as the application]". In principle, we can certainly agree with this. However, we believe that this is a major issue that cannot be determined by one or two symposiums. We earnestly hope that experts who are concerned about the future of the nation and its people and who have experience and research in education will express their insightful opinions. We are determined to publish and openly discuss and research them within the possible scope, in order to obtain more accurate and truthful conclusions and more active and concrete plans. Our future era is one of independence, liberation, recovery, and reconstruction. The secondary education plan for such a new era should be a thorough liquidation of the old system and old methods. On the one hand, we must develop the legacy of Eastern spiritual civilization to transform the entire academic atmosphere, but on the other hand, we must not ignore the fact that the times are only moving forward, and we must stand on the position of science and catch up!</p>
<h3>85th Session of the Japanese Diet to Hold Closing Ceremony This Afternoon</h3>
<p>House of Representatives Passes "All-Out Decisive Battle" Bill</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) The 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet, November 11 was the final day of deliberation. On this day, the House of Peers held a budget general meeting at 9:00 AM, where Mr. Udo Takao continued his questioning from the previous day. A total of eleven people stood up to encourage the government to promote its decisive battle measures. In the evening, in addition to the general budget supplementary bill, two other bills were resolved. Immediately after, a plenary session was held to submit and pass them. At this point, all budget bills submitted by the Diet were completely passed by both houses according to the government's original plan. Also, the House of Representatives held meetings of the Recommendations and Petitions Committees from 10:00 AM, and a plenary session at 1:00 PM. Finally, a resolution was expressed to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States with national unity. Mr. Yamazaki Tatsunosuke stood up and explained the resolution to dedicate ourselves to the decisive battle, following the Emperor's will. It was decided in an atmosphere of certain victory throughout the entire venue. Thus, the Diet session facing the enemy for the past five days was completed, and the closing ceremony will be held on the 12th. Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) The 85th Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet has been scheduled for 11:00 AM on the 12th at the plenary session hall of the House of Peers to hold the closing ceremony. On this day, the Emperor will not attend in person. At that time, Prime Minister Koiso, the Army and Navy ministers, the Vice-President of the House of Peers, the Speaker and Vice-Speakers of the House of Representatives, and members of both houses will gather in the hall. Prime Minister Koiso will respectfully read the Imperial Rescript, and the Vice-President of the House of Peers will respectfully receive it. The ceremony will conclude and the meeting will be adjourned. Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) The Japanese House of Representatives, in order to express gratitude for the Imperial Rescript granted at the opening ceremony and in view of the importance of this Diet session's mission, submitted a resolution on the final day of the Diet (November 11) to reverently uphold the Imperial Will. Prime Minister Koiso, on behalf of the government, expressed his gratitude and revealed that the government trusts the people to take the lead and advance towards the path of decisive victory. Also, the Yokusankai decided to promote a major national movement based on this resolution after the meeting. The text of the resolution is as follows: "The war situation is critical, and the fate of the Empire is at stake. We, reverently upholding the Imperial Will, dare to take the lead with indignation, consolidate the unity of hundreds of millions of people, concentrate the nation's total strength on the path of decisive victory, vow to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States, and hope to reassure the Imperial mind."</p>
<h3>Japanese Katsuta Budget Committee Chairman Reports on Increased Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>Minister of Agriculture Explains Food Storage Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) During the plenary session of the Japanese House of Representatives on the 10th, Katsuta Eikichi, Chairman of the Budget Committee, reported: "Increasing aircraft production is the main task of this Diet session. However, government authorities have already explained the future policy in detail during the closed meeting, which is fully understood. If this policy and plan are implemented, increasing aircraft production will be very easy. In the previous closed meeting, it was also explained that this policy corresponds to the bravery and good deeds of the soldiers on the front lines, and in the decisive battle in the future, we will surely destroy the United Kingdom and the United States." Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada stated on the 10th at the House of Representatives Budget Committee, regarding the storage situation of emergency food during air raids, in response to a question from Mr. Noguchi Kiichi, that the storage of food supplies is currently being implemented in Keihin, Nagoya, Kitakyushu, Hanshin, and other important areas. The storage volume for each area has already been determined, and each area is establishing a policy of dispersed placement and striving to implement it, achieving excellent results. Dispersed storage is for the needs of supplying emergency situations. In response to a question from Mr. Mori Hajime, he clarified the rice crop situation this year, saying that the crops this year were initially worried due to water and drought disasters, but the weather turned better and the crops in various places were very good, reaching the yield of previous years. Emergency measures for drought and flood disasters have been added to sowing this time, and efforts are being made to handle the aftermath. Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) Japanese Minister of Home Affairs Odate replied to Mr. Nonashina's question regarding civil air defense at the plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 10th, saying that the number of households to be evacuated throughout Japan is 120,000, and 76% have already been evacuated. The number of evacuations in Tokyo and Nagoya has reached its highest point. The population evacuation plan is estimated at 600,000 people, and the number of evacuations in Tokyo has reached 630,000. In the future, the elderly and children will be evacuated to their relatives and friends. The evacuation of buildings is mostly completed, and interval evacuation is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Ba Maw's Statement</h3>
<p>Rangoon, November 11 (Central News Agency) Burmese Head of State Ba Maw issued the following statement on the 10th: In his speech, Prime Minister Koiso clarified that the independence of East India will be recognized soon, which is based on the Great East Asia Joint Declaration and is one of the last cornerstones of the construction of the Great East Asia structure. It is also evidence that this war is a war of liberation for the peoples of Great East Asia. In the future, the freed peoples of Great East Asia, Burma in the west, the Philippines in the east, and East India in the south, will bear the heavy responsibility of defending the gateway to East Asia. Due to this fact, the propaganda spread by the enemy to deceive the world has been fully exposed. Now, the only task of the people of Great East Asia is that we should live and die together for the sake of defending freedom and honor. We will resolutely adhere to the policy indicated by Prime Minister Koiso.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Commends Meritorious Factories</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) The Japanese Navy's Ship Administration Headquarters held a meeting at the Ship Administration Headquarters on the morning of the 11th to hold a commendation ceremony and awarded letters of appreciation to factories such as the Imai Research Institute for their meritorious service in increasing the production of naval weapons. The Imai Research Institute completed the production of domestic raw materials.</p>
<h3>Close Cooperation Between China and Japan to Build Great East Asia</h3>
<p>Important Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech on the 7th at the 85th Diet session. Before the section on Thailand, there was a speech on clarifying the moral spirit between China and Japan and building Great East Asia. This section is the most important of the speech. We are providing this text below: The relationship between China and Japan has become even more consolidated under the alliance treaty, as the Japanese army has continued to fight bravely on the north and south continents of China for more than seven years. During this time, they have been working hard to drive out the invading forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, so that China can be liberated from their century of oppression, and then seek to build Great East Asia based on the spirit of morality. Japan's true intentions have now gradually penetrated among the Chinese people, and the cooperation between China and Japan is becoming even closer.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>When the reporter bid farewell to Moscow, the most concerning issue for the citizens of the capital, following the progress of the war, was the opening of commercial food stores, commercial bars, and department stores. April 15th was the day after the famous Russian holiday of Pascha. Affected by the economic recovery policy in the city, the atmosphere of the former religious revolution, which was reported before the festival, unconsciously revived, becoming the focus of citizens' curiosity and hope. Twenty-seven or eight commercial food stores, which were very lively and opened all at once on the main streets of Moscow, were gifts for the Pascha festival and immediately stirred the hearts of the citizens. It was rumored that the citizens who opened the stores ran ahead of us and lined up in long lines in front of the food stores. Many police officers were dispatched to organize the enthusiastic lines.</p>
<h3>Unbelievable Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Looking at the items displayed there, such as meat, vegetables, canned goods, sugar, candy, bread, alcohol, fruits, tobacco, etc., all the daily necessities of food are available. However, the value of the commodities displayed there is staggering. For example, sugar is 800 rubles per kilogram, bread is 1,000 rubles, meat is about 400 rubles, cakes are 50 rubles each, apples are 50 rubles each, vodka is 200 rubles per bottle, wine is 300 rubles per bottle, and white bread is about 100 rubles per kilogram. (The exchange rate of the ruble to the Japanese yen is 35 yen 60 sen according to the diplomatic corps rate). Now, if the average monthly wage of workers and staff members in the Soviet Union is calculated at about 400 rubles, then their one-month labor value is only equivalent to the value of one kilogram of meat or half a kilogram of sugar. Therefore, the price of this kind of food store makes people feel like they are being treated like fools. No wonder citizens often stand in place and curse, saying: "This store is an anti-religious store. The prices they set are truly unbelievable." The following is an interesting conversation among Moscow citizens: "A very grand museum has been opened everywhere since yesterday. Have you been to see it?" "I haven't been to see it yet. What kind of museum is it?" "That's very good. Humans may not have tasted such rare things before. Now you can visit for free. Go and see it!"</p>
<h3>The Excitement of New Stores Opening</h3>
<p>But despite the mockery, the lives of the citizens of Moscow have become more lively due to the opening of new food stores. People with a little money in their hands want to buy something. Everyone is scheming for business. The largest food store had a turnover of about 30 million rubles on the opening day, which was reduced to 3 million rubles a month later, but the number is still considerable. Soon after the opening of this kind of food store, commercial bars also appeared like bamboo shoots after the rain in the same places as before the German-Soviet war. And these are also the "anti-religious" bars that the citizens talk about. The prices of both wine and dishes are very high, and customers will never get drunk. Soup is 30 yen per bowl, beef cake is 50 yen per bowl, and a bottle of wine is 100 yen. If you study it a little, you have to pay one or two thousand gold. Therefore, customers cannot always eat and eat with trepidation, afraid that they will not be able to pay the bill. Although listening to jazz music, they are uneasy in their hearts. It's like running all night without jazz music. But officers with two Heroic Medals hanging on their chests are cheering and drinking with two or three women at the same table. However, he often cannot pay the bill and collects money from familiar friends to perfunctorily pass. The general public rarely visits these places.

<h3>Crossing the Ou River to Conduct a Surprise Attack, Japanese Army Occupies Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Completely Crushing Enemy US Attempts</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 11th: After the Japanese army in Zhejiang Province started operations near Jinhua, they separately defeated the Chongqing army in the area, attacked the Ou River, and captured Wenzhou on the 9th. A Certain Japanese Army Base, November 11 (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army in southern Zhejiang occupied Lishui, they continued to advance along the Ou River towards the coast, eliminating the resistance of the newly organized 22nd and 33rd Divisions of the Chongqing army, and occupied Wenzhou at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Guangzhou, November 11 (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Japanese army is now fiercely attacking Qingtian, which is located between Lishui and Wenzhou. Another unit is fighting fiercely near Wenxi, 10 kilometers east of Qingtian, bypassing Qingtian. Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army in Zhejiang Province began operations near Jinhua along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in mid-August, they gradually defeated the Chongqing army of the Third War Zone under the command of Gu Zhutong and advanced southward. On the 27th, they captured Lishui, a strategic point in the area, and were preparing for the next stage of operations. After the operational posture in the area was fully prepared in early September, they began the attack and finally captured Wenzhou, the largest stronghold of the Chongqing army in southern Zhejiang Province, on the 9th. Recently, the Chongqing and US forces have built deep positions on the mountains on both sides of the highway from Jinhua to Lishui to Wenzhou in an attempt to obstruct the progress of the Japanese army and continue to act in an attempt to cut off the Japanese army's rear supply route, but they were eventually defeated by the Japanese army everywhere. The Japanese army also carried out a surprise attack, crossed the Ou River, and suddenly occupied it. Wenzhou is a liaison base for the Third and Seventh War Zones of the Chongqing army, and is an important military stronghold of the Chongqing army. It is also a coveted area for the enemy and the United States. Recently, the enemy and the United States have clearly intended to use the area as a base to cut off the southern transportation route of Japan, and even as a bridgehead for the continental operation. However, due to the Japanese army's preemptive strike and capture of the area, the enemy and the United States' attempt has been crushed in the bud.</p>

<h3>Japanese Air Force Raid on Chengdu of Great Strategic Significance</h3>
<p>Chongqing and US Air Forces Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses</p>
<p>Tokyo, November 11 (Central News Agency) When the US Air Force B-29 aircraft stationed in Chongqing recently raided southern Manchuria, the Japanese air force, in addition to intercepting them over Anshan and on their way back, braved the bad weather on the same day and attacked their base centered on the Chengdu airport and destroyed the American planes that had just returned,</p>
<h3>reaching 40 aircraft</h3>
<p>The process by which the Japanese air force achieved such a great victory was that the American B-29 military formation stationed in Chongqing was detected by the Japanese air force when it took off from a base near Chengdu. It immediately intercepted the enemy in mid-air over Zhengzhou, resulting in the destruction of eight of them, of which four caught fire and fled south in a hurry. Secondly, in the Manchuria area, the Japanese air force</p>
<h3>over Anshan</h3>
<p>also definitely shot down three planes and destroyed six planes. Afterwards, in China, the Japanese air force severely intercepted the enemy planes on their way back near Zhangde, shooting down three planes, one of which was unconfirmed, and destroying two planes. When pursuing the fleeing aircraft group, one more plane was destroyed near Tai'an. Finally, in preparation for attacking the B-29 air force base near Chengdu, it braved bad weather on the night of the 8th and eliminated the resistance of enemy fighters,</p>
<h3>carrying out a large-scale bombing raid</h3>
<p>The B-29 base group that had previously been returning had fiercely bombed the Xinjin and Pengshan airfields between the third and fourth days of September, achieving great results. Another team fiercely bombed the Shuangliu, Guanghan, and Zhongxing airfields. In that area, due to weather conditions, the battle results could not be accurately determined. On the other hand, the Japanese air force suddenly detected a B-29 plane that was forced to land near Laohekou, Hubei, and immediately attacked it, and soon burned it down. The</p>
<h3>combined battle results</h3>
<p>of the above-mentioned fierce battles and two offensive operations were that a total of 40 enemy planes were shot down, destroyed, and burned, almost half of the enemy's planes. The enemy's losses can be said to be extremely heavy. On the contrary, the Japanese side only had two planes that did not return during the attack and four planes were sacrificed during the operation, and the rest safely returned to their original defense. In order to attack the Japanese mainland and southern Manchuria, the American army</p>
<h3>near Chengdu</h3>
<p>built a B-29 base, forming the Rong aviation fortress circle. The Japanese air force's bombing of Chengdu, in addition to the two air raids in the 29th and 30th years of the Republic of China, this was the first offensive operation since the construction of the B-29 base. Also, since the American air force stationed in Chongqing lost the Hengyang and Lingling airfields on the Yuehan Railway line, the</p>
<h3>gradually felt powerless</h3>
<p>for the base group in Guilin, so the expectations for the Chengdu base group have become more important. Unexpectedly, it was once again attacked by the daring Japanese air force, so the great significance of the Chengdu offensive operation is indeed a major new development in the Japanese-American air war.</p>

<h3>Results of Edible Oil Registration</h3>
<p>— KURIHARA, Toraji</p>
<p>In light of the current commercial situation, the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Federation, in order to understand the consumption status of edible oil, an important staple food for the citizens of Shanghai Special Municipality, and its current situation, established a registration system for the existing quantity and sales of edible oil. On the 26th of last month, members of the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Association, i.e., oil mills, edible oil dealers (wholesalers), and retailers in Shanghai, were notified to register.</p>
<h3>Registered Quantity of Edible Oil</h3>
<p>Regarding the registered contents of the existing edible oil, the four Chinese oil mills and two oil presses that have completed registration with the association have registered all of their stocks. In addition, 141 dealers and 335 retailers have registered. Looking at the total number of operators, the registration rate for oil mills is 100%, but the registration rate for the others is relatively low. However, upon closer inspection, it can be confirmed that the registration rate is about 7% of the actual number of businesses. Among the 270-280 dealer members, about 200 are still operating. The total number of retailers is approximately 1,500-1,600, but more than two-thirds of them are also engaged in the business of food and grocery stores, and the oil they store is minimal, so it is not a problem. This is because there are only about 500 specialized edible oil retailers. Compared with the results of previous registration orders for daily necessities and rice by various authorities, according to rumors in the market, the results of this edible oil registration can be said to be quite good. Looking at the registered quantity, the existing stock of oil mills is more than 5,000 piculs, the stock of dealers is more than 21,300 piculs, and the stock of retailers is more than 9,870 piculs, totaling more than 36,200 piculs. Assuming that the average annual consumption of rice per person is 2 shi (approximately 200 kg) and the average annual consumption of edible oil per person is 10 jin (approximately 5 kg), then the total registered quantity of oil, more than 36,200 piculs, can be said to be equivalent to the registration of 724,000 shi of rice.</p>
<h3>Natural Reduction in Consumption</h3>
<p>Moreover, the actual monthly consumption of edible oil by citizens is about 0.6 jin per person, which has naturally decreased. Therefore, the registered quantity is more than sufficient to last for one and a half months. In addition, it is estimated that unregistered oil accounts for about 30%, approximately 12,000 piculs. Furthermore, citizens also have some oil stored in their homes. Even if the source of edible oil is inconvenient or scarce, a certain amount of replenishment (estimated at 300-400 tons) can be obtained each month. Therefore, it seems that edible oil will not become an imminent crisis. However, in recent times, the market price of edible oil has increased more sharply than other goods, which have risen generally due to the electricity saving problem. Why is this? It goes without saying that it is due to the hoarding of financial capitalists. The actual effect of preventing this malpractice is being studied, and a control measure that does not greatly harm the interests of the operators is being sought. Therefore, there is the current system of issuing warehouse receipts, restricting the period of time that operators can store goods, and the registration system. The Control Committee hopes to announce a system that does not cause even minimal harm or anxiety to legitimate buying and selling transactions.</p>
<h3>Cooperation of Employees</h3>
<p>Fortunately, we have obtained the above registration results with the understanding of the same industry. This tells us that if operators are not allowed to make undue profits, and the appropriate profits and normal business are not caused any inconvenience, and the handling is not unreasonable, then the conscientious employees will not hesitate to cooperate. In other words, because the person in charge of the Control Committee is a Chinese industry leader, and the cadres are all familiar with the same industry, it is felt that they will never mistreat our colleagues or hinder legitimate trade, which makes everyone feel relieved. Perhaps this explanation is not self-praise! In short, this is indeed a gratifying fact.</p>

A letter was sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government requesting the central authorities to instruct local government agencies to thoroughly investigate and encourage rice production to ensure the food supply. The Municipal Government has now replied that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been consulted and that each provincial and municipal government has been instructed to handle the matter accordingly.</p>
<h3>Police Continue to Crack Down on Opium Dens</h3>

They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Earnestly Hope Opium Addicts Will Register and Quit</h3>
<p>The bureau is also cracking down on opium while earnestly hoping that opium addicts will love themselves, register as opium addicts as soon as possible in accordance with the law, and quit opium in stages. They must absolutely not hold back and violate the law. At the same time, privately established opium dens are also expected to close voluntarily and not provide customers with opium for smoking or sell opium for profit. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished in accordance with the law. It is also hoped that citizens will report to the Opium Suppression Department at any time so that officials and the people can cooperate to eliminate the atmosphere of opium in Shanghai and refresh the city's appearance.</p>

Therefore, it convened its third committee meeting yesterday to discuss the matter seriously. It was decided that the various districts' offices are currently conducting their various affairs for this month as usual, which is difficult to interrupt, and that the expenses are already huge, making it impossible to make up for them. Therefore, it was decided that the transfer date for each district under command should be stipulated as between the 20th and 30th of this month, and no later than September 3rd, which will still be collected by each district for the purpose of ending the process.

<h3>Tongren University of Shanghai Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shanghai Private Tongren University, after more than a year of preparation since its inception in July last year, is now ready. A grand opening ceremony was held at the university on Datong Road at 10:00 am yesterday (11th). Government officials present included Foreign Minister Chu, Director Dai of the Education Bureau representing Mayor Chen, Lu of the Health Department, Sun Lifu, Lin Ji, Liao Jianan, Chen Zhongfu, Yuan Junchang, Chen Shaowei, Zhao Zhengping, Xu Liqiu, Ding Fubao, Yan Fuqing, Zhang Enlin, and others. Allied representatives included Minister Usami representing Ambassador Gu, Counselor Matsubayashi, Secretary Nakata, Director of the Yutian Army Hospital, Major Takahashi, Lt. Col. Fujie, Lt. Col. Qiao Zheng, Rear Admiral Kondo, Rear Admiral Ito of the Navy, Naval Attaché Rear Admiral Kondo, Watanabe Yuxiong, President of the Japanese Residents Association, Funatsu Tatsichiro, and other guests from all walks of life and all students, totaling more than a hundred people.</p>
<h3>Principal Chu's Speech</h3>
<p>First, Principal Chu Minyi of the university delivered an opening speech, reporting that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Allied Japanese government, in view of the closure of most of the medical schools and health institutions established by the British and Americans in China, and the inconvenience felt by the Chinese people due to the lack of medical and diagnostic institutions, specially established Tongren Hospitals in various parts of China to relieve young people who had lost their studies and the suffering of patients. At the same time, in order to cultivate talented young Chinese medical personnel, preparations were made for the establishment of Shanghai Medical University. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee on July 25 last year, it was decided to establish three colleges: medicine, pharmacy, and hygiene, and named it Private Shanghai Tongren University. In accordance with the provisions of the revised regulations for private schools by the Ministry of Education, a board of directors was established. Vice Chairman Miyakawa of Tongren Association and I have discussed the matter several times, and appointed Mr. Lu Runzhi, Wen Lanting, Wu Zhenxiu, Xu Guanqun, Yan Fuqing, Le Wenzhao, Jiang Kun, Guo Shun, and Yuan Jufan as directors, and I was elected as chairman. With the assistance of the government authorities and the Allied authorities, the preparatory work proceeded smoothly, and the former St. Mary's Girls' School on Changning Road was selected as a branch campus. It was also agreed that Renji and Hongren Hospitals would be the teaching hospitals of the university. The original intention was to establish the three colleges during the war, but due to the lack of medical materials and the difficulty of transporting equipment, only the medical college was established. I concurrently serve as the dean of the medical college, and Mr. Zhang Sukang was appointed as the secretary-general, Mr. Higashiniro as the dean of academic affairs, Professor Tsuzuki of Tokyo Imperial University as the consultant, and Mr. Tsurumi Hisashi as the director of general affairs. After the personnel were determined, registration procedures were carried out with the Education Bureau, and with the support of Mayor Chen and Minister of Education Li, the registration was approved. Thanks should be expressed to Mayor Chen and Minister Li. After all the preparatory work was completed on the 6th of this year, enrollment began on July 1. However, due to the small size of the school buildings and the imperfect equipment, the board of directors decided to temporarily enroll 30 students in this term, so that each student can study quietly and avoid the worry of neglecting one thing for another in teaching. Unexpectedly, young people from all over Beijing and Shanghai heard the news and applied for admission, reaching more than 1,000 people. I deeply regret those who missed the opportunity, and I sincerely hope that the officials of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people from all walks of life will provide guidance and supervision in the future, so that this school can fulfill this great mission.</p>
<h3>Mayor's Admonition</h3>
<p>After the speech, Director Dai of the Education Bureau, representing Mayor Chen, read the mayor's instructions, which mainly stated: At the intersection of the righteous positions of China and Japan, the Allied Japan is sparing no effort in building Greater East Asia. The establishment of Tongren University this time is of great significance. Allied medicine is advanced, and the people are healthy. Due to the lack of medical talent in our country, we have been subjected to the humiliation of being called the "sick man of East Asia." This time, thanks to the Allied government for sending well-known medical experts to China to assist in the cultivation of medical talent in our country, I believe that they will be able to complete their mission. At the same time, it will also make a great contribution to the communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures. After the mayor's instructions, Director Lu of the Health Department, Minister Usami representing Ambassador Gu, and guest Chen Zhongfu delivered speeches successively, and after reading the congratulatory telegram from Minister of Greater East Asia Konoe, the ceremony concluded at 12 o'clock.</p>

<h3>Symposium on Secondary Education</h3>
<p>In order to discuss the general direction of education improvement, this newspaper held a symposium on university education on the 4th of this month. On the afternoon of the 6th, a symposium on secondary education was held at the Gongshang Lianyi Association. The attendees included Fan Baoruo, Sun Deyu, Sun Xiangzhong, Xu Fu, Ju Qingyuan, Ruan Binhua, Zhu Yunnan, Zhang Gongsu, Gu Jia, Kong Minzhong, Chen Tianyu, Lin Buji, Xu Jingqing, Cui Jianwu, Feng Zhen, Li Yulan, and Wu Pengfei, all teachers from various middle schools. The meeting was chaired by Huang Jingwan, director of the social service department of this newspaper. The following is a record of the main points of the symposium: Huang Jingwan: I am very honored that all the teachers have taken the time to attend the symposium on secondary education today and express their valuable opinions. Education is a reflection of the politics and economy of the times, and schools are the main source of education. Secondary schools, in particular, are the key to determining the advancement of education. All the speakers are rich in experience in secondary education and must have profound insights into how to improve and reform the current problems of secondary education. Therefore, I have specially raised several core issues and asked you to express your opinions. I would be very grateful.</p>
<h3>First: Improving Teachers' Living Conditions</h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Now, please elaborate on the issue of "improving teachers' living conditions." According to recent reports, the municipal government is particularly concerned about the education sector and is preparing to implement a special allocation system and teacher insurance system for education personnel, which is very exciting. At the same time, this newspaper also has teacher and staff subsidies and medical aid funds to fulfill its service responsibilities. Chen Tianyu: To address the lives of teachers, I would like to speak from two aspects: ○ On the teacher's side, teachers have a great influence on students. (1) Teachers should have the ambition to take education as a lifelong career. (2) Teachers should have outstanding knowledge and specialized skills. (3) Teachers should have exemplary moral character. ○ On the school's side, (1) in terms of material aspects, teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible, at least to maintain their health. (2) In terms of spiritual aspects, schools should not regard teachers as employees, but should make teachers recognize themselves as the center of the school and encourage the spirit of teachers. The best measure is to make the economy public, such as pre-paying salaries to stabilize life. When life is guaranteed, the spirit will naturally be comforted. Kong Minzhong: When it comes to education, those who run schools should certainly think of ways, but most importantly, the government authorities should also bear the same responsibility. The government's efforts for education can be regarded as the minimum! Cui Jianwu: Colleagues in the education sector, whether principals or teachers, should jointly take responsibility and work together to solve the current crisis, so that the phenomenon of "school shops" will no longer exist in the future. Fan Shiruo: Regarding the issue of teachers' lives, we can now come to a conclusion: ○ We hope that the education authorities and society will attach importance to education. ○ The school's economy should be made public, and teachers' salaries should be increased as much as possible as a percentage of total income (at least 70% or more), especially for elderly and retired teachers and staff, who should be given preferential treatment. ○ Promote the guidance teacher movement. ○ The media should reveal the darkness of the education sector based on facts.</p>
<h3>Second: Review of Scholarship Movement</h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Our newspaper has been running scholarships for seven sessions, with poverty, excellence, and health as the screening criteria. We are sincerely grateful for the assistance of various schools, and we hope that schools will strictly educate and manage the students who receive assistance and maintain close contact with our newspaper. Now, for the review of the scholarship movement, please express your opinions. Cui Jianwu: Your newspaper has achieved excellent results in running scholarships. However, I would like to suggest that the admission standards be relaxed, especially for students who are indeed poor but whose grades are slightly worse, who should be given special treatment for relief. Fan Zeruo: In addition to the examination method, please refer to the school's usual grades, because some students are temporarily flustered and psychologically abnormal, resulting in poor screening results, which often leads to failure to be selected. Huang Jingwan: Regarding the screening criteria, our newspaper does not completely rely on the examination. The examination is only one of the criteria. In addition to the score, we also refer to the family situation and grades at school. If the grades at school are very good or too poor, we will handle them carefully and try our best to avoid speculative attempts. Regarding this point, I would like to ask all schools to assist us. Now, please express your opinions on the aspect of relieving students who failed to be selected. Xu Fu: If students in our school do not receive enough scholarship money or are not approved, the teachers and students will create a scholarship to make up for it. In the next semester, we plan to adopt a grade-based scholarship system to enable students to develop the virtues of sympathy and mutual assistance, so that no one will drop out of school due to the inability to afford tuition. Kong Minzhong: Primary and secondary schools are the foundation of general education, and the number of primary and secondary school students is the largest. Therefore, please increase the percentage of scholarships approved by your newspaper for primary and secondary school students. As for our school's response to the scholarship movement, in addition to providing free tuition to the top five students with excellent grades in each grade, we also provide free tuition to those who receive scholarships from various places and who are particularly poor, and return the scholarship money. Xu Jingqing: I believe that scholarships should pay special attention to poverty. Those who are excellent but not poor will not be approved, but those who are poor but whose grades are slightly worse should be given flexibility. Our school provides free tuition to scholarship students who are particularly poor, and also returns the scholarship money they receive to purchase books and stationery. Xu Fu: Regarding reducing the burden on students, our school implements a book borrowing system, that is, teachers encourage students in senior grades to lend their used books to students in lower grades. This method can be used as a reference for various schools. Fan Zejun: In summary, there are four points that can be used as a reference for future scholarship movements: ○ Attention should be paid to usual grades. ○ The approval criteria should focus on primary and secondary school students. ○ Emphasis should be placed on the word "poverty" rather than excellence. ○ Please increase the number of free places in various schools and maintain close contact with scholarship agencies.</p>

<h3>Third: Restricting Transfers to Maintain Student Level</h3>
<p>Hua Gujingwan: Since running scholarships, we have gained some experience. Now, the number of students transferring at all levels is very large. Among them, there are legitimate reasons such as relocation or different interests. However, some students are fickle and some skip grades. In short, it is not beneficial to schools and students, and all schools should pay serious attention to student transfers. Fan Zeruo: Regarding the issue of transfers, restriction or prohibition is of course impossible, but attention should be paid to the connection of grades, because there are often false and untrue phenomena. Therefore, in addition to a piece of diploma, strict examinations should be carried out to ensure that the course work is connected and there is no abuse of skipping grades.</p>
<h3>Fourth: Extracurricular Life of Middle School Students</h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan: In addition to the educational problems within the school mentioned above, we feel that it is necessary to guide the extracurricular life of students. Cui Jianwu: Regarding students' extracurricular life, the most important thing is to promote normal entertainment. Fan Zeruo: Please, you guys, promote more and add public sports fields as places for students to rest and play after school. It is best to open up places with a suitable location and a large area, such as parks and racetracks. Ruan Binhua: Organize student research societies, reading societies, lecture societies, etc., and provide guidance from the school. Kong Fanzhong: I think that the above points can all be included in school life. In addition, we should also promote handicraft and music courses, on the one hand to cultivate temperament, and on the other hand to reduce improper entertainment. Apart from this, I think the less extracurricular activities, the better. Wu Pengfei: Our school has always focused on moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic development, especially physical education, with emphasis on life guidance, so that students will not be detached from the life of the masses and become lonely bookworms. Fan Gongruo: Within the possible scope, please schools promote and guide students' extracurricular life, increase music and handicraft courses as much as possible, or designate some places as sports fields for students.</p>
<h3>Fifth: Post-War Educational Construction Policy</h3>
<p>Sun Xiangzhong: The current trend in education is too much emphasis on utilitarianism, which can indeed make young students have ambitious goals. However, the development of utilitarianism promotes material civilization. The more developed the material, the more external things are enough to change people's temperament, resulting in hedonism. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, our country has always paid too much attention to Western civilization and put our own culture behind us. Therefore, on the surface, social activities are as hot and intense as fire, but in essence, they are gradually declining. From the perspective of education, the national character is gradually declining. Therefore, in order to reverse the crisis, the most important thing is human-based education. The so-called human-based education is that every citizen, whether in psychological or physiological aspects, must have sound development. In other words, it is to promote morality. The effect of promoting morality is to enable every young person to have the inherent nature of mutual generation, mutual support, mutual respect, mutual love, filial piety, loyalty, trust, etc., so as not to be blinded by the social habits of rampant human desire. In this regard, China's current education is undoubtedly a failure. For example, many university students often cannot even use their own national language, can write with a fountain pen but are not good at using a brush. In fact, this is too far from true civilization. General schools often pay too much attention to specialization and ignore basic education because they pay too much attention to material and ignore spirit. Therefore, the most important responsibility of primary and secondary school education is to preserve the inherent culture and develop the inherent nature of youth in addition to introducing Western civilization. I feel that the temperament of general schools is generally low, which has a great impact on students. If everyone in our education sector can adhere to the purpose and jointly take responsibility, the students will naturally cheer up. We cannot follow the world, we must change the world. Following the world is utilitarianism, and changing the world is humanistic culture. This is the reason why humans are different from animals, and this is also the difference between civilization and barbarism. For example, if students only have formal politeness to teachers, and when time passes, they regard each other as strangers, this is a manifestation of utilitarianism, but what we need is human nature education, so we must teach the relationship between people, the relationship between teachers and students, and so on. In this way, even if we do not teach the form of bowing and saluting, there will naturally be a close spiritual connection between teachers and students. The current social turmoil and the failure of politics to get on the right track are undoubtedly the failure of education. The relationship between politics and education is like a chicken and an egg. If politics is bad, it is not easy for education to improve. If education does not develop, politics will not get on the right track. History has created us, and we will create the next generation. Passing on from generation to generation, constantly changing. As for the trend of the next generation, it depends entirely on the efforts of the current education sector. Therefore, on the one hand, we should educate students, and on the other hand, we should pay attention to the social and political trends to eliminate material desires with spiritual strength. Sun Deyu: Just now, Mr. Sun elaborated on his profound insights and clearly defined the direction for the future of education. However, I feel that in implementation, the first thing is to improve the curriculum. The content of extracurricular reading materials for middle school students is too dangerous. Once the thinking is divergent, it is very difficult to correct it. In elementary school, it is still innocent, but middle school can be said to be a degenerate institution. In ancient times, my country's teacher-student relationship included imparting knowledge, teaching skills, and explaining culture, but today's education cannot be implemented in any way. On the contrary, it has become a store for selling class hours. Teachers are not responsible, and students' respect for teachers and Taoism is even more out of the question. Therefore, I advocate improving the curriculum and introducing our country's inherent culture. Currently, teachers are not well-fed and lack strength, and are always concerned about their lives. Students often waste their studies and focus on money, and are wandering in the wrong direction, developing a myopic view of psychology. However, the responsibility of secondary education is not less than that of universities and elementary schools. The Book says, "Be precise and unified, hold the middle." The word "middle" can also be interpreted as the word "middle" in middle school. "Yangzi wept when he saw a fork in the road." If we are not careful, we will make a big mistake. Therefore, we should hold a far-sighted vision, improve the content of the curriculum, target the drawbacks of "what you learn is not what you use, and what you use is not what you learn," and at the same time take care of physical and mental cultivation. The method, such as weekly meetings and memorial weeks, is a kind of mental training. In addition, we should also run more vocational education. Fan Zeruo: The above two Mr. Suns have expressed their earnest and profound remarks and given us clear enlightenment on the future direction of education construction. Now, to summarize it in one sentence, it is "character education as the foundation, and scientific education as the application."</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Rende's Frugality and Donation to Charity</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Rende of Yangzhou, courtesy name Daosheng, is a well-known figure in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles, and a standing director of the Zhongjiao Daoyang Association.

<h3>Correspondence</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Issuing Department of the Central Reserve Bank sent a letter yesterday stating: [Having read Mr. Cheng Qipeng's article [The Issue of Withdrawing the Smallest Denomination Banknotes] in the National Forum column on September 7th, there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the Bank's handling of subsidiary currency exchange. This Bank has always tried its best to exchange subsidiary currency without restrictions, but for practical convenience, it is stipulated that it should be exchanged in units of one yuan. This letter serves to correct the record.]</p>

<h3>Thunderstorm</h3>
<p>That morning, Longfu got up especially early. While brushing his teeth in the washroom, he heard the radio.</p>
<p>[Hmm...]</p>
<p>He was suddenly startled, and dropped the aluminum teacup to the ground. He jumped, and his socks got wet, but he didn't notice at all.</p>
<p>[Good... good!]</p>
<p>That was all he was aware of. For a moment, his body trembled. Of course, it wasn't because of fear. It was because of mixed feelings, the surging of his heart and body. After a moment, his head lowered. He even forgot himself and wanted to pray to heaven. Bean-sized tears fell onto the bed, one by one.</p>
<p>Even so, he was an employee of the Naval Ministry, and he hadn't known a single piece of news until he got off work yesterday. Of course, as just a military employee, he didn't want to know such a top secret about starting a war, but he just felt strange. Only today did he understand. Actually, if he guessed, he might have known. But looking at the atmosphere within his department, whether yesterday or the day before, everything was the same as usual, without any change.</p>
<p>(Truly admirable!)</p>
<p>Longfu wasn't sad because he was a military employee, but instead deeply felt the Navy's control. What Westerners called the [Silent Navy] was now fully realized.</p>
<p>He quickly washed his face and went back to his room to put on his suit. Given the nature of his work as a painter, he usually didn't go to work until nearly noon, but today he couldn't stay in his room.</p>
<p>Taking his shoes out of the wooden shoe box, the landlord came out in his pajamas and said,</p>
<p>[The fighting has finally started!]</p>
<p>This landlord was always talking about money, usually very despicable and petty, but on this day, his face showed a clear and moving expression.</p>
<p>[The fighting has started... truly exhilarating!]</p>
<p>Longfu put on his shoes and jumped outside.</p>
<p>Although he went to the restaurant where he usually ate breakfast, he didn't feel hungry and didn't want to eat anything. If he were a soldier, perhaps he wouldn't care at all in this situation and would still eat heartily, but he felt like he was fine without eating.</p>
<p>The passengers in the streetcar had completely different expressions than yesterday. No one was reading the newspaper. The morning newspaper sold faster than ever today, and it had already sold out completely.</p>
<p>Longfu felt like he had forgotten something very important, and thought of Zhenren.</p>
<p>(Zhenren must be very happy! Then where is he exactly? If he were an air force officer, perhaps Zhenren would definitely be assigned to the front line, but Zhenren is a naval officer...)</p>
<p>The streetcar stopped at Yotsuya Station. He ran up the stairs to catch the bus. (140)</p>
