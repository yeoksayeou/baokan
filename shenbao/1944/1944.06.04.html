<h3>星期評論　為糧食問題諍吿　中日當局　陳彬龢</h3>
<p>昨天大陸新報社評，題為「深刻化的米糧問題」。後發生很多感觸。是文主旨，第一，强調米糧問題的嚴重性，其他問題可以暫時緩辦，而應傾注全力調整米糧問題。第二，對於投機份子及企業家化的農民，應運用政治力量消滅之。這些意見，在原則上是準確的。不過還有補充說明的必要。自從政府公布京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要以後，直至昨天市府佈吿自由運米為止，在這短期間內，本巿米價黑市的跳躍，簡直是瘋狂，所以如此者，當然原因複雜，但投機份子利用拉抬者，實為主要原因。幸而市當局下了決心，發表自由運米的布吿，昨天米價居然急直下回。　　不過，巿府佈吿自由運米，僅在搬入口管理辦法未公布以前的暫時辦法，權宜之計。將來怎樣，姑不推論。我們認為糧食部也好，米統會也好，唯一的前提，就在辦得好，可是，過去的事實，已經吿訴我戊是失敗了。然而，為什麼辦不好呢？可以很肯定的說，焦點還是人事不健全。所以，我們在過去並不主張機構調整為第一，而一貫主張人事健全為第一。試舉例而言，如粉麥專業委員會的工作，中日雙方人士都有好評，因為該會的中日負責當局以及工作人員，都肯努力做事，對外界自然都有信用。又如棉業統制委員會工作，雖無特殊成績，却也並未辦壞，甩人勉向專與精，而不任用私人。誠然，粉麥與棉業兩會，範圍與事務，比較米統會簡單，在客觀上容易處理。然而，因為米糧重要，對於米統會人事健全的客觀要求，自更迫切。可惜，米統會當局忽視了責任，政府當局亦漠視放任，在該會成立以後，雖然發現職員失職事件，縱容姑息，未加懲辦，實不足以取信人民，尤其愧對糧食部處理貪汚案件。</p>
<p>市政諮詢委員會成立以後，首先重視民生問題，因而組織生活必需品小組委員會專事研討，首先對於糧食問題有所建議。可是，得到兩種惡意的反響：　說諮詢委員會有取米統會而代之之意。實際上諮詢委員中對於糧政有專門硏究者，並無其人。同時，我個人更主張辦事業專家化，尤其是重要的糧政。譬如孫仲立先生對於粉業極有關係；聞蘭亭先生對於棉業極有關係。這兩會的重要幹部盡量甄用專家。老實說，諮詢委員中固無糧政專家，卽退求其次，對於糧政熱心而有資望者，如李思浩馮炳南兩先生，縱然政府有意延致，但事實上亦不肯就任。所以，謂諮詢會取米統會代之者，純為惡意的造謠而已。　說這次政府頒布民食米措置綱要以後，米價反高，或許是諮詢委員會建議所促成的。但是，實際上政府對於諮詢會建議採取了幾點，不難核閱的。况且，我可以武斷的說，諮詢會的建議，決不是諮詢委員私人成見，而是基於人民意見的要求的。</p>
<p>總之，糧食問題對於各個方面的重要性，早已為各階層所討論，所認識。我們深信中日當局更能瞭然見到。這裏，請求中樞當局必須澈底的合理的解決，不要枝枝節節的解決，反而增加其嚴重性。根據過去的經騐，實施統制，凡是多規定一種手續，就是多給予一種敲詐的機會。譬如沿途勒索為什麽不能澈底消滅，投機奸商以及企業家化的農民又為什麼不能消滅，如果運用政治力量加以消滅，固然需要。然而，必須先運用政治力量，使米糧統制機關人事健全，奸商囤米，投機作弊，一律處以戰時極刑，然後，淸滅沿途勒案，加强運輸方便，减少農民痛苦，協助農民生產，一切的一切，運用政治力量，才有成效，這是目前遝用政治力量最顯明的使命。</p>
<p>同時，希望盟邦當局注淤遠者大者，協助中樞政府全力解決民食問題，必須聽取中國廣大人民的呼聲，凡是適合中國國情民情者，一定走得通。譬如協助中國農民生產，就須多派專家深入民間，液輸近代農業技術；就須協同確立鄕間治安。尤應注意凡與中國人民直接發生關係者，往往為不肖之徒從中蒙蔽，造謠中傷，增加人民誤會。</p>
<h3>日翼政會昨召開　第三次臨時總會　通過國民進軍第一綫决議</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電日翼政會為整頓機構，適應時局並展開翼贊活動起見，特於三日下午二時起，於此間該會本部召開第三回臨時總會，出席者有阿部總裁。顧問。總務職員及會員等四百餘名，政府方面到有安藤內相等閣僚，首由各部長分別報吿國民總蹶起運動及其他各項，繼由阿部總裁致辭，嗣並通過決議文一項，迄三時許始行散會。茲將該決議文錄次：當玆戰局益趨緊張之際，亦則皇國興廢之重要關頭，故望全國國民應及速把握時機，立即挺身於國民總進軍之第一綫，以期於早日擊滅英。美，而副天皇陛下之希冀。</p>
<p>阿部總裁演說阿部　阿部總裁演說要旨如次：昨年乃世界史上之一大　換期，其中最重大之事件，即為於東京舉行大東亞會議之事，日本根據道義之世界觀，將彼英·美勢力自南洋·婆羅洲·菲律賓逐出，大東亞各民族各國之相提携，實為確認完遂大東亞戰爭意義之表現。基於共存共榮，獨立親和，闡揚文化，經濟繁榮，世界進運五大原則，建設大東亞，貢獻於世界和平，此為大東亞宜言對內外所宣明者。此勿諭如何，實為對彼等一痛烈打擊，且於人類史上存一向所未有之光彩，依此宣言，大東亞諸國之眞實獨立同盟之提携，益將有其顯著之實績。反之，於反軸心各國只顧焦慮短期之決戰，如開羅會談或德黑闌會談，因急謀打開戰局，乃有誇大之言詞。但究其實績則毫無所致，其矛盾情形，由此事例常不待言，由其彼此間道義觀之相異，利害關心之不同，而各懷野心，是故彼等之企圖終必致於失敗。世界戰事迄於今日，已歷五年之久，且對未曾有之大消耗戰，仍在繼續中，諸國對此莫不傾其物資戰力，以突入此階段，即向以物資自誇之美國，其生產力亦已達於極峰，因此英·美之焦燥乃益趨深刻，故勿論彼等如何施策，以挑撥短期決戰，而戰局本身，終陷於不活潑之狀態。反之，最近我等生產力之增加，即為明證，尤其大東亞各國民衆，能不畏艱險，協力擊滅英·美之建設作戰，故無盡資源得以節節開發。因此，吾人當確信最後之勝利，將一億國民之總力，悉數使用於生產方面，俾期一舉繫滅仇敵，敵人因戰局之部分轉變，即大呼最後勝利，此正為敵人對自己武力戰已失自信力之一明證。固然，戰爭之進展，難免影響國民生活，但此乃敵我兩方共通之現象，於此時期，所謂決定勝敗之關鍵者，首在視敵我兩方國民戰意之孰勝孰裴，吾人當愼記於雖一人之努力與否，亦足以影響國家興亡之命運。凡我國民，如能一億一心，則余敢確信必能違到擊滅敵人之目的。</p>
<h3>大東亞各民族　協議會事務局</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電僑居日本之大東亞各民族約一萬七千餘人，日本翼贊會興亞總木部，為與此等各國僑民常時聯絡，互相交換意見，以完遂大東亞戰爭，特於東京設置大東亞各民族協議會事務局，聞現已着手籌備，料該局今後對大束亞共榮圈之建設，必可有莫大之貢默。</p>
<h3>日畫家傑作　贈日德學院</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電海通社訊：皇宮供奉畫家高井氏，以最近傑作一幀，贈與此間日·德文化學院。皇室伏見宮海軍大將，昨日下午參觀該院時，代表贈與。</p>
<h3>片桐中將殉國　特敍功授勳</h3>
<p>東京三日中央社電新幾內亞日軍第一綫兵團長片桐茂中將，自去年三月赴前綫指揮以來，曾於芬希哈罕重創美澳軍樹勳功後，轉戰於馬常地區，克服一切困難，終於四月二十八日壯烈犧牲，此次蒙天皇陛下賜於恩賞，頃由陸軍部及賞勳局發表如次：陸軍中將片桐茂叙功二級，授金　勳章，叙黝一等，授旭日大綬章。</p>
<h3>日軍某部隊長　說明豫戰特質　澈底粉碎渝方戰力</h3>
<p>洛陽三日中央社電日軍進佔洛陽後，華北派遣軍某部隊長，為視察該地民生狀况，已於日前抵此，並就此次河南作戰之特質，及安定佔領地域民生之方策，說明如次：此次作戰之特質，並非在地點及地域之佔領，而係在於澈底粉碎渝第一戰區之戰力，拯救久受渝方壓榨之河南民衆。是故當日軍對洛陽推進攻略戰時，一面旣須傾其全力，消滅駐屯洛陽北方高地之渝軍，另一面更須盡其最大努力，防護洛陽市街，使之脫離戰火。故今佔領地城之治安，其情形頗為良好，至洛陽居民，其對日軍尤其信賴，刻正紛紛返回幫里。余認今後當局尤須着力於民生之安定，更須指導洛陽之民衆，使之自身防衛鄉土，以發揮其高度之自治自衛精神。復據當地農民稱，今年小麥豐收，此次收獲量，實可充三年間之食糧，故能藉黃河之水利，而得使該地域脫離水害，則其所資於民生之安定者，決非淺鮮。又據洛陽居民稱，渠等甚願恢復隴海綫之交通，並不惜貢獻一切之勞力云。此外在洛陽地械，可利用洛河，但吾人斷不能漠視陸運之加强。且此間更有小麥棉花煤炭桐油及水銀等物資生產，故以與華北華中之交易上而論，對運輸機關之充實，尤應縝密考慮。蓋重慶統治下之民衆，其最感痛苦者，即為重稅與强制徵兵，但日軍在新佔領地帶方面，今已講求適常之施策，以期廓淸上述之重稅，與强制徵兵之惡弊，而使各地之居民，各安其業云云。</p>
<p>美機襲鄭擊落四架</p>
<p>洛陽三日中央社電二日上午九時許，在渝（P240）型美戰鬥機十一架，來襲鄭州附近，實行機槍掃射，其後又企圖襲擊黃河鐵橋。當飛至渡河點上空之際，日軍當即以猛烈砲火將之射擊，日機亦出動應戰，結果擊落敵機四架，其餘皆愴惶遁走，日軍損害極微。當地之華人勞工，死傷數名，敵機之此種盲炸，徒增民衆怨恨而已。</p>
<p>美敎士述空襲情形</p>
<p>廣州三日中央社電據重慶美聯社電稱，河南作戰時，有英美傳敎師十三名，歷盡艱辛，於五月十三日行抵重慶。其當時吾等已乘火車向西安進發，火車進行極緩，然日機空襲不分晝夜。吾等所乘火車只得在黑暗之隊道中停止兩日，車內煤烟與呼吸之臭氣，幾令人有窒息之勢。至兩晝三夜後抵西安，居兩週後，所感受之恐怖與疲勞，已令吾等作無生望之感，抵重慶後，知物價又高昻若此，吾等以為除回國外，別無生路矣。　　日機夜襲衡陽零陵</p>
<p>漢口三日中央社電日航空部隊會於二日深夜，冒雨往襲衡陽，及零陵渝機塲，轟炸零陵之中炸彈，毀其滑行路及附屬設施，並炸毀其停放地地軍事設施一所會中彈發生大爆炸而起火焚燒。</p>
<p>日軍圍攻八坂渝軍</p>
<p>洛陽三日中央社電　日軍左翼追擊各隊部，十五日擊碎譚村之敵據點後，循浴陽公路而進，行至八坂附近，發現擁有迫擊砲之敵軍三千名，即對之取包圍攻勢，而獲得此次開戰以來之大戰果。即日軍各部隊於接到探兵之報吿，知前方有敵後，於秘密中乃目左右對之加以包國，於下午一時，日軍距敵丘陵上陣地僅三百米時，敵始發覺，業被包圍，於是乃以捷克機槍猛烈亂射，敵乃張輝明團長率領之三十八軍二十七師，及三十五師，自遭受日軍之追擊，由陝縣逃至復師新安，以至該地之狼狽情形，歷歷在目。於探得實情後，日軍部隊開始攻擊，在壓縮左右之包圍錢，激戰僅四小時，即將敵營長陳嘉謀以下五九三名俘虜。是役所獲之戰果如次：敵棄屍一三〇〇具以上，俘虜五九三，鹵獲迫聲砲四門，重機槍十一　，捷克機槍六三挺，步槍五二〇枝，手槍三五枝，電話七架，其他武器及子彈甚多。</p>
<p>譯評</p>
<h3>深刻化的米糧問題</h3>
<p>南京·上海兩巿的民食米臨時措置綱要，上海巿民食米管理暫行辦法等雖已頒布，但米糧問題愈趨深刻，事態已成不可猶豫之勢，市政諮詢委員會，市尚會及其他有力的五個團體亦已提出建議案，而言論辦關亦連日加以討論，這種事實，謂之和平地區的社會關心集中於民食問題，並非過言。關於民食米臨時措置綱要的運用，有各種意見及建議，例如應明示徵購價格的規定方針，一石以內的米糧搬入應該自由，除去隨發給護照而起的弊害以期公平迅速，以及廢止一切苛捐雜稅等的主張。這些皆就實際而論，可為當局者採用或參考，自不待言。至於巿商會及其他五團體的建議，亦屬民間方面的意見，自應聰取。但最要緊的一點是：當局者有否按照先前發表的方針着手解決米糧問題的決心，以及是否採取着着實行此種決心的捎置。如果祇本於必須採取某種措置的一般要求，決定當局的方針，而無準備的予以發表，則投機者流與農民一定蔑視此種決定，任意隴斷巿塲。今日是巧遲不如拙速的時候，是即使不得期其最善亦應徹底實行次善方策的時候。如果缺乏繼公布基本方針之後子以實蹊的具體準備，則一時的心理上的好影響，勢將旋即消滅於無形。同時，更須知道：縱以米糧的移動為理由，將價格的決定委於可及的自然之推移，憑此決不能解決米糧問題。價格的騰貴促令米糧集中而可自為調節作用，固屬無疑，但僅賴乎此在平時已不可知，而在目前這樣的環境，到底是不可能的。投機囤積分子固不待言，即為生產者的農民亦多數具有企業家心理，在如此的現狀下，其希望米價的高之又高，殊為自然。他們雖在不使市價因供多轉疲的範圍內徐徐處分手中所有的米糧，但由移動自由和今日的高價而被誘急急脫手，是不會有的事。常此放任這樣的事態，其意義便是將米糧市塲委諸投機商人和已經企業家化的農民　斷。為防止此事起見，竊思有有效運用行政力的必要，但常局者果有充分的對策嗎？總之，民食問題具有一日不容緩的重大性。當局者應表示即使辦其他一切亦須解決此問題的熱意與實踐性，並勢力加以解決。（吉：譯自六月三日大陸新报）</p>
<h3>華萊士抵俄　發表演講</h3>
<p>安加拉三日中央社電海通社訊，此間得莫斯科消息：在赴渝途中之美副總統華萊士，已行抵西伯利亞，華氏在伊科斯克城發表演說稱，美國與蘇聯極為相似，渠曾在塲達根康沙稠爾斯克與約科斯克等城勾留一滬，對各地巨大之工廠船塢與農村，印象極深。華萊士並預料美國·加拿大·阿拉斯加·與此西伯利亞·將於戰後世界事務上，佔有重要地位。</p>

<h3>日對華政策不變　決盡力予以援助　谷大使返京對記者團談話</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電日駐華谷大使為請　示要公，回國後於六月一日返抵南京。二日下午五時，在官邸接見記者團，當就各問題發表談話如次；此次為報吿當前各問題，並有所請示，曾于上月底返國。方臺於中國正展開大規模作戰，硏討適應當地之對策，乃當務之急，自不待言。對華新施策始終一貫，努力推行。如食糧問題，中國有任何要求，日方均盡力予以援助。目下由于陳代理主席等國府指導者之熱心努力，各種施策，均能順利推進。聞七月一日起，各級官吏公務員之增薪等亦可實現。關於食糧問題，最近正準備米統會商統會之改組問題，此事與治安之良否，有密切關係，余意待各種問題調整後，最近將來即可見諸成功。又關於上海大使館事務所地位間題，隨戰事之推移，亦正考慮其機稱之强化及擴充云。</p>
<p>汪主席政躬康復　褚外長表示謝忱</p>

<p>東京三日中央社電日本靑木大東亞相，二日下午於官邸招待記者團，舉行茶話會，席次對於大東亞各地域之戰時經濟，如何克服種種困難事，披陳意見謂：日本之天東亞共榮圈經濟政策之根本目的有二，其一為共存共榮經濟，其二，為協力戰爭經濟，但共存共榮經濟，顯然係日本戰勝後之事，故當前仍須置重點於協力戰爭經濟上。如是，則今日大東亞各地域對日本遂行戰爭之種種協力，無論為物資，為金錢，均極關重要云云。誠如靑木大東亞相所謂「熟誠輸將」，但如何置重點於協力戰爭經濟，日本與英，美根本相異之點，即絕對排除英，美之只顧自已而行之强權政策。為使共榮圈之經濟力量得繼續協力戰爭，固當振興經濟，為使各地域民生安定，尤有振興經濟之必要，是以急速振興各當地民需產業，實為當務之急。日本為此，正排除萬難，對各地之技術資材等，予以極力支援，對此靑木大東亞相相謂關於振興大東亞各地域經濟可能者，決令即行實施，倘不可能者，將來亦必盡力使其實現等語，此言此意，實戰時下日本共榮圈經濟政策之根本態度。</p>

<h3>新中國的精神</h3>
<p>— 友松圓諦</p>
<p>日本佛學家友松圓諦敎授，應新聞報與本報主辦之學術購座聘為講師，已於上月底抵滬，昨日出席上海市佛敎會歡迎會，並將分赴各處演講，昨晚九時應本市廣播電台之邀，作廣播演講，茲誌其全詞如次：</p>
<p>我們站在這上海的街頭，試看這往來如織的人們和林立的建築，實在要懷疑到自已現在究竟，在什麼地方？孫中山先生所創造過的新嗎？自然，我是不能以這曾經做過國際商埠的。那是「假裝的新中國」，而不是眞正的東西　　民族的自覺　那末，「新國的精神」是什麼呢？那便是孫中山先生所創造的「三民主義」。但是這「三民主義」的新精神，是常被非常歐美化地理解，而不是站在中國的立塲的。第一的「民族主義」，是中國人應具有中國人的民族的國家的自覺，應該做一個本來的中國人。中國人即使帶上鼻眼鏡，抽着雪匣煙，出入於教會，結果還是中國人。無論英語怎樣漂亮的人，他在夢中或危急的時候，也是要說他生下來所說的話的。只有在本來的精神之上，才能看到精神的安定。在中國人的心靈深處流着的精神，是通於孔子和孟子的古典的。醫如「論語」，便是以中國的山河風物為情景，在中國人的風俗習慣之上所編述的衛大而具有永久生命的天文學。孔子所設的聖賢之道，實在是成為中國人的民族意識之內容。這樣的古典，實在是潛在於諸位的心底和家庭的深處。無論是儒敎，道敎，佛敎，都不是在於古典的形式和其他殘該，一離了它的中心的精神，到什麽地方去找新中國的民族主義呢？雖然像我這樣一個佛教研究者，也是常常準備著一本論語放在座右的。可是對於今日的大學生和靑年，如果一說孔子的話，簡直究全不是對手，而且會被認為腐敗的，那是因為完全不知道其內容的緣故。一般人似乎認為拔去了古典，便可以理解三長主義的樣子。那是因為在孫中山先生的一部分學生們，年輕而沾著歐美思想的綠故。從事於中國的敎育事業的基督敎所辦的敎會學校，便是數典忘祖抺殺了中國民族的意識而造成排斥其他黃色民族之理論的。如果眞正深刻地行了「民族主義」，則便是上種儒敎，道敎與佛教古典之復與，且　即會　農到像孫中由先生所說過的「大亞細亞」的菜同意識來的。民族意識始於家族，擴大到宗族鄕黨，再擴大到民族以及其共榮圈，似乎是一種命運的前進。這是一稱思想的共榮圈。但是中國不幸，因為採取了「以夷制夷」的妥協之道，所以一面雖主張民族主義，上面却依賴着英美。聰說近來重慶的指導者似已感到這種矛盾，而注意於中國的古典，對於武器雖仍仰着英美，而思想却已加以拒絕。現在正陷於不知所可的狀態。但是他們能够注意到這一點，已經是可喜的了。我們以盟邦一個國民的資格，是極願對於中國精神的昻掦有所帮忙的。如果對於中日文化事業有關係的事，即使是麻煩了「日本」也是想要來做一番為帶中國的工作的，目前在各方的心裏已可以看見中國的經恢復到古典的精神，這是非常可以慶祝的。賣中國給英美之有背於國父的遺訓是很顯然的。</p>
<p>民生的安定　第二要數到了「民生主義」，這是可以率直地窺見國父的東洋思想的。為政者的要事，便是怎樣能使所有百姓的生活安定。然而以此「民生」和法國革命思想相混，而當為社會契約論，和社會主義。共產主義相比較，似乎與左翼理論是有一脈相通的：但這完全不是祖述着孫中山先生的東洋精神。這個「民生全義」，是出發於君子聖賢的仁義的。在上海刋行的有一個季「覺有清」的佛敎雜誌，因為「菩　」這個梵語的譯字，乃是利他大悲的求道者。是自利與利他俱皆圓滿的人。肯把自己拿着的麵包切下一半布施貧者，又再肯割下自己的血肉給予兄弟的，這便是菩薩。殺身成仁是君子的事，捨了白己，把自己放在後面的，這便是「利生」，「濟生」，「度生」和「民生」。這並不是主張人類的平等論，是即其差別而感到平等的大慈悲時，自然會有　機的「民生。」賢者如顏回的淸貧，若是只顧自己，怎麽會感到民有飢色呢？這個，民生」，並不是孫中山先生所發明的。乃是中國五千年的傳統的「仁」之德。尤其是中國的佛敎，是敎人慈悲而導至布施福田的。近代的中國，因為從英美過於學習了唯物論和功利主義，過於醉心於自由主義與享樂主義，所以就是對於這「民生」，也已忘却了五千年的聖賢之道，而用物質本位，自我本位的英美化的想法來要理解的。那並不是「新中國的精神」。新中國的精神是該將古賢的仁慈之道，實現於現代中國的政治組織之上的。這裏也是不能不考慮到古典精神之復活的。</p>
<p>民權的實踐　第三「民權主義」，它在被歐美化加以歪曲之後，思想已經混亂。究竟自民國以來，西洋化的「民權」，是什麼時候被實踐了呢？這件事情，即在日本也是有着困苦的經騐的。議會制度實行的時候，因為開頭便是西洋化的民權思想，所以曾使民族意識陷於混亂。這種「民權」，並不是「民主」，「民本」之說，乃是要使百姓兆民黨贊政治的上意。東洋所有的，是以王道政治和仁德。而欲普及於下的善政德治，因此這是上下一體，上行下靡，這然一如的組織，而不是可以和英美化的權利義務同視的。所謂「民權」，並不是要從人民旁邊，主張自己的持權而拘束為政者的權力的。那是和東洋政治的傳統所不一致的。東洋的政治，必須以君臣一如，上下一體為原則。為政者必須常常自己反省，常常其於廉潔，公正，和淸貧，常常傾耳於民意的呼聲，努力叩盧而使野無遺賢。今日在這中國雖費了多大的努力，但能尚未看見這王道政治完全的實現。明治維新的一個標語，是「庶民一途，使民不懈」，並且還有「萬機決於公論」，百姓萬民若不奮起，而國力是不能產生的。中國的人若是一個一個的會見，則有優秀敎養的人雖然很多，但那民衆的心聲，却未能充分地上聽「民權」二字，幾乎是被用作個人主義和遁世思想的代名詞。為政者必須先對聖賢之道以淸自己。上有所行，下必效之。於是陣頭指揮，率先垂範的新生活運動才會起來。這樣一來民意暢達，公論叢生，那麽，中國便會於無意間成為王道樂土的。這樣鄰邦得因此而保全，大亞細亞的新秩序才會成立。　　以上關於民族，民生，民權的三民主義，必須把它脫離了英美化的解釋，使它再現於中國本來的古典精神之中，這樣中國的靑春的姿態才能出現。怎樣地把那古典精補再現於現代，我以為這是課與中國，日本，以及全東亞諸民族的一個任務。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　敎職員生活的澈底改善方法</h3>
<p>— 羊啼</p>
<p>敎員生活之淸苦，巳是不能否認的事實。近來物價飛漲，其生活的困難，當然更趨嚴重·深蒙當局能體念下情，所以有此次向學生家長徵收敎職員生活補助費的發起。我敎員同仁，眞如久旱之得甘霖，莫不感激。</p>
<p>但細細想來，要實現這個辦法而達到有效的目的，實在有很大的困難。其最大的癥結所在，便是不能引起一般家長切於實際行動的同情。他們認為各校所收的學費，大多已是不小，如何還在喊敎員生活淸苦，要解決這個問題，當然不能再在家長頭上打算。還有一點：一般學校裏十分之八九的學生家長是薪水階級，收入有限，際此百物昻貴之時，恐與苦敎員同樣有生活維艱之歏吧。那末彼此間病，再請他們來相助，於理不通，於心何忍？即使有些家長能深表同情的，也是腲者有限，粥少僧多，試問每人能得幾何？杯水車薪，恐亦無濟於事。所以全市的學校，數以各計，然正式遵當局辦法辦理的，却祗十三校（廿三日林局長的談話），其他尙在猶豫不決中。</p>
<p>總之，事實可以吿訴我們，當局用意雖善，然欲達到理想目的，實非容易。况且這不過是個治標之法，欲謀根本解決，還有待於敎靑當局進一步的努力。希望能以政治力量，飭令各校經濟必須公開，再組織學校經濟調査委員會，審査各校經濟收入之實數與開支預算等問題，把盈餘均等分配於敎職員，勿使校長獨呑其利。這樣庶不至於產生資本家式的校長與奴隸式的敎員了。</p>
<p>再說目前敎育的腐敗，也是不容諱言的事實。這問題的機結所在，筆者以為做敎員的大都為了生活淸苦而有朝三暮四見異思遷之想，五日京兆，因此不能把敎育當作終身事業，於是便不能專心於敎育的發展與改進，則其漸趨於腐敗，乃必然的事。當局如能依照上法實行，而使敎員生活得到最低限度的解決時，那末敎師才能樂榮安命，把學生精力貢獻於事業之進展，則敎育之發達，也是意想中事。至於本學期敎職員生活補助費的解決，也可參照上法實行，　學一校經濟盈餘之數，均分敎員，務必使敎員不受校長之剝削與苛待。最後，當局如政令旣出而有不能　照的學校，當局可派員接收為有效辦法。誠能如是，則敎員生活問題，方可澈底解決</p>

<p>在此非常時期，有許多人，為了會應節約起見，都脫去了長衫，實行穿短衣，這實在是一個很可喜的現象！本來長衫所費的料子，約佔短衣一倍。當此半絲半縷，物力維艱的時候，這未免是一種無謂消耗，並且穿了長衫，以便做事，不若穿短衣的走路輕快，動作敵捷。不過我以為用的衣料，現在雖有棉布，即可配給，最好　是採用土布的好，因篇旣經濟，又　穿，處處都合乎節約的原則。如果我們每個人都能實行穿土布短衣，那不但我國賞業，可以振興，農村經濟，可以繁榮，社會也可因之富裕了。（魯仁）</p>

<h3>給妹妹的信（七）海軍</h3>
<p>— 保岩困豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>左面的岬，深深地陷入房　的山影裏，而中間有一條藍帶般的海，奇怪的東西一，就是從這個地方出現了。如用一句神話形容詞來說，就是尼里爾根故事中的總。如用殺風景的比擬來說，就做江東一帶的工場，當洪水時期，向海中冲流一樣。因為在動着，隆夫認為一定是船。正在不知是什麽的期間，那個影就離開了岬，發動着白花般的波浪，向正面的海前進。他的速度很快——　　（像一艘軍艦。）</p>
<p>夫看到了艦經所飄揚的旗幟。不大的工夫，在太陽光下的　姿，可以看得淸淸楚楚了。像長長的鐵橋一樣的艦體出現了。主砲的砲塔出現了。</p>
<p>（是重巡洋艦！）</p>
<p>隆夫也有點常識，懂得軍艦的區別。在他的腦海裏，自然而然地淨現出「海軍」雜誌和有終會的軍艦照片薄上，所得到的知識。</p>
<p>（呵，好像是高雄級的軍艦！）</p>
<p>他覺着精神像疲倦了的樣十。而心中於是願意手舞足踏。因為他還是軍人組的一個學生時期，只有高雄級的軍艦，才是憧憬中的軍艦。新式的重巡洋艦那樣偉大而威武的外貌，比任何軍艦的照片，都强烈地捉住了他的心靈。他的噸數，武裝，速度，一直到如今，都在他的心裏像愛人的面影一樣，一直到如今，都在他的心裏像愛人的面影一樣，永遠地牢記着。</p>
<p>（高雄級的軍體，在我的眼前飛馳着。）　　他忘記了一切，陶醉於幸福中了。當艦隊在鹿兒島入港的時候，眼睛雖然睜得　鷄蛋般大，但也未曾發見的軍艦，終於今天看到了。　　「眞是毫險……眞是好艦！」</p>
<p>由於激烈的感動，他使脫口而說出這樣的話。這艘軍艦，完全像穿着深靑色的　鎧，而威風凜凜地通前綫出發。他茫茫然，凝視看這種資態而出神，須臾間，他無意職地用手開始在旅店租來的浴衣袋裏來回摸索。他是摸索總不離身邊的寫生薄的。</p>
<p>然而，絕望於畫的他，在此次旅途中，甚至一支鉛筆也未帶。同時他淸楚地知道，縱令此次帶鉛筆來，此處因爲是要塞區，也不能從事寫生　　但，他的手仍然繼績不斷地在摸索衣袋。巨艦的產影，在達達的水平綫上浮游着，一直等到被右面的岬影遮住的起間，隆夫的手指在頓動着，在胸前摸上摸下。</p>

<h3>Weekly Review: A Plea for the Grain Issue - To the Chinese and Japanese Authorities - Chen Binhe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the "Continental New Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Deepening Grain Problem." It evoked many feelings afterward. The main points of the article were, first, to emphasize the seriousness of the grain problem, stating that other issues could be temporarily put on hold while all efforts should be focused on adjusting the grain issue. Second, it stated that speculative elements and farmers turned entrepreneurs should be eliminated using political power. These opinions are accurate in principle. However, further explanation is necessary. Since the government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption in Beijing and Shanghai," until yesterday's municipal government announcement of free rice transportation, the jump in black market rice prices in this city during this short period was simply insane. The reasons for this are, of course, complex, but the use of price manipulation by speculative elements is a major cause. Fortunately, the municipal authorities made a decision and issued an announcement of free rice transportation, and yesterday the rice price actually fell sharply. However, the municipal government's announcement of free rice transportation is only a temporary measure pending the announcement of import management regulations, a measure of expediency. What will happen in the future, we will not speculate for now. We believe that whether it is the Ministry of Food or the Rice Control Committee, the only prerequisite is to do a good job. However, past facts have already told us that we have failed. However, why can't it be done well? It can be said with certainty that the focus is still on the unsoundness of personnel. Therefore, in the past, we did not advocate institutional adjustment as the first priority, but consistently advocated personnel soundness as the first priority. For example, the work of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has been well received by both Chinese and Japanese personnel because the Chinese and Japanese responsible authorities and staff of the committee are willing to work hard, and naturally have credibility with the outside world. Similarly, the work of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, although without special achievements, has not been done badly, selecting people based on expertise and avoiding the appointment of personal connections. Admittedly, the scope and affairs of the Flour and Wheat and Cotton industries are simpler than those of the Rice Control Committee, making them objectively easier to handle. However, because grain is important, the objective requirement for personnel soundness in the Rice Control Committee is even more urgent. Unfortunately, the authorities of the Rice Control Committee have neglected their responsibilities, and the government authorities have also ignored and condoned this. Since the establishment of the committee, although cases of dereliction of duty by employees have been discovered, they have been tolerated and not punished, which is insufficient to gain the trust of the people, especially ashamed of the Ministry of Food's handling of corruption cases.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Municipal Advisory Committee, it first focused on people's livelihood issues, and therefore organized a small committee on necessities of life to specialize in research, first making recommendations on the grain issue. However, it received two malicious reactions: It was said that the Advisory Committee intended to replace the Rice Control Committee. In reality, none of the members of the Advisory Committee were specialists in grain administration. At the same time, I personally advocate for the specialization of experts in handling affairs, especially the important grain administration. For example, Mr. Sun Zhongli has extensive connections in the flour industry; Mr. Wen Lanting has extensive connections in the cotton industry. The important cadres of these two committees should be selected as experts as much as possible. Honestly, while there are no grain administration experts in the Advisory Committee, even if one were to take a step back, those who are enthusiastic and have qualifications in grain administration, such as Mr. Li Sihao and Mr. Feng Bingnan, even if the government intended to extend an invitation to them, they would not be willing to take office. Therefore, saying that the Advisory Committee is replacing the Rice Control Committee is purely malicious rumor-mongering. It was said that after the government promulgated the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption" this time, the price of rice actually rose, perhaps prompted by the recommendations of the Advisory Committee. However, in reality, it is not difficult to verify which points the government adopted from the Advisory Committee's recommendations. Moreover, I can assert that the recommendations of the Advisory Committee are definitely not the personal opinions of the advisory committee members, but are based on the demands of the people's opinions.</p>
<p>In short, the importance of the grain issue to all aspects has long been discussed and recognized by all levels. We firmly believe that the Chinese and Japanese authorities can see it even more clearly. Here, we request that the central authorities must thoroughly and reasonably resolve the issue, and not solve it piecemeal, which would only increase its seriousness. Based on past experience, implementing control, every additional procedure is an additional opportunity for extortion. For example, why can't extortion along the way be completely eliminated, and why can't speculative merchants and farmers turned entrepreneurs be eliminated? If political power is used to eliminate them, it is certainly necessary. However, it is necessary to first use political power to make the personnel of the grain control mechanism sound, and to impose wartime extreme penalties on merchants who hoard rice and speculate, and then to eliminate extortion along the way, strengthen transportation convenience, reduce the suffering of farmers, and assist farmers in production. Only with the use of political power will everything be effective. This is the most obvious mission for the current use of political power.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that the Allied authorities will pay attention to the distant and the important, and assist the central government in fully resolving the issue of civilian food. They must listen to the voices of the broad masses of the Chinese people. Anything that suits China's national conditions and the feelings of the people will definitely work. For example, to assist Chinese farmers in production, more experts should be sent to the countryside to import modern agricultural technology; they should also work together to establish rural security. Special attention should be paid to the fact that those who are directly related to the Chinese people are often blinded by unscrupulous people, who create rumors and slanders, and increase misunderstandings among the people.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Wing Political Society Convened Yesterday - The Third Extraordinary General Meeting - Passed the Resolution on the People's Advance to the Front Line</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - In order to reorganize the organization, adapt to the situation, and launch support activities, the Japanese Wing Political Society held its third extraordinary general meeting at its headquarters here at 2 p.m. on the afternoon of the 3rd. More than 400 people attended, including President Abe, advisors, general affairs staff, and members. Government officials including Minister Ando attended. First, the heads of each department reported on the National General Uprising Movement and other items. Then, President Abe delivered a speech. Afterward, a resolution was passed and the meeting adjourned at around 3 p.m. The resolution is recorded below: At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly tense, and also at a crucial moment for the rise and fall of the Empire, we hope that the people of the entire country will seize the opportunity as soon as possible and immediately step forward to the front line of the people's general advance, in order to destroy England and the United States as soon as possible, and to live up to the Emperor's hopes.</p>
<p>President Abe's Speech. President Abe's speech can be summarized as follows: Last year was a major period of change in world history. The most important event was the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo. Japan, based on a moral worldview, drove out the British and American forces from the South Seas, Borneo, and the Philippines. The cooperation between the nations and countries of Greater East Asia is a manifestation of confirming and completing the meaning of the Greater East Asia War. Based on the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and friendship, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and world advancement, to build Greater East Asia and contribute to world peace, this is what the Greater East Asia Declaration declares to both domestic and foreign audiences. This, no matter what, is a painful blow to them, and it will leave a glory in human history that has never been seen before. Based on this declaration, the true independence and allied cooperation of the countries of Greater East Asia will have more significant achievements. On the other hand, the countries that oppose the Axis powers only care about anxious short-term decisive battles, such as the Cairo Conference or the Tehran Conference, and exaggerate their words in order to urgently seek to open the war situation. However, in terms of actual achievements, nothing has been achieved. The contradictory situation is often self-evident from this example. Due to the difference in moral views and the difference in concerns about interests, each harboring ambition, their attempts will inevitably lead to failure. World war has been going on for five years and has been continuing in an unprecedented war of attrition. Countries are pouring their material and combat power into this stage. Even the United States, which has boasted of its resources, has reached the peak of its productivity. Therefore, the anxiety of England and the United States is becoming more and more profound. Therefore, no matter what policies they implement to provoke a short-term decisive battle, the war situation itself will eventually fall into an inactive state. On the other hand, the recent increase in our productivity is clear evidence. In particular, the people of Greater East Asia can cooperate in destroying the construction operations of England and the United States without fear of difficulties, so endless resources can be developed step by step. Therefore, we must be confident that the final victory will be achieved, and that the total strength of 100 million people will be used in production, so as to destroy the enemy in one fell swoop. The enemy calls for the final victory due to a partial change in the war situation, which is a clear proof that the enemy has lost confidence in its own military power. Of course, the progress of the war will inevitably affect the lives of the people, but this is a common phenomenon for both the enemy and ourselves. At this time, the key to determining victory or defeat lies first in seeing which side's war will is stronger. We must keep in mind that whether or not a single person makes an effort is enough to affect the fate of the country's rise and fall. If all our people can be united as one, then I dare to believe that we will definitely achieve the goal of destroying the enemy.</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Ethnic Groups Council Secretariat</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Approximately 17,000 people of various ethnic groups from Greater East Asia reside in Japan. The Asia General Headquarters of the Japanese Support Association has established the Greater East Asia Ethnic Groups Council Secretariat in Tokyo to maintain constant contact with these overseas residents and exchange opinions with them in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. It is said that preparations are currently underway, and it is expected that the bureau will make immense contributions to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Painter's Masterpiece - Gifted to the Japanese-German Academy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Haitong News: Court painter Mr. Takai has gifted one of his recent masterpieces to the Japanese-German Cultural Academy here. Naval Admiral Prince Fushimi of the Imperial Family visited the academy yesterday afternoon and presented the gift on behalf of the court.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Katagiri Died in Battle - Specially Awarded Merit and Decorations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Katagiri Shigeru, commander of the Japanese Army's First Line Corps in New Guinea, had been commanding the front line since March of last year. He inflicted heavy damage on the American and Australian forces at Finschhafen, and then fought in the Mamu area, overcoming all difficulties. He finally died heroically on April 28. This time, he was given a reward by His Majesty the Emperor. The Army Ministry and the Decorations Bureau announced the following: Lieutenant General Katagiri Shigeru is awarded the Second Class Merit, awarded the Golden Kite Medal, promoted to First Class, and awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Grand Cordon.</p>
<h3>A Japanese Military Unit Commander - Explains the Special Nature of the Henan Campaign - Thoroughly Crushing the Chongqing Forces' Combat Strength</h3>
<p>Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A certain unit commander of the North China Expeditionary Army of the Japanese Army arrived here the other day to inspect the people's livelihood in the area after the Japanese Army occupied Luoyang. He explained the special nature of the Henan campaign and the measures to stabilize the people's livelihood in the occupied areas as follows: The special nature of this campaign is not in the occupation of locations and areas, but in thoroughly crushing the combat strength of the Chongqing First War Zone and saving the people of Henan who have been oppressed by Chongqing for a long time. Therefore, when the Japanese army advanced on and captured Luoyang, it had to devote all its efforts to eliminate the Chongqing army stationed in the northern highlands of Luoyang, and at the same time, it had to make its greatest efforts to protect the streets of Luoyang and keep them away from the flames of war. Therefore, the security situation in the currently occupied area is quite good, and the residents of Luoyang, in particular, trust the Japanese army and are returning to their villages one after another. I believe that the authorities must pay attention to the stability of the people's livelihood in the future, and must guide the people of Luoyang to defend their homeland by themselves, so as to give full play to their high degree of autonomy and self-defense spirit. According to local farmers, this year's wheat harvest is abundant, and the amount harvested this time can actually feed them for three years. Therefore, if the water conservancy of the Yellow River can be used to free the area from water disasters, then its contribution to the stability of the people's livelihood will be by no means small. According to residents of Luoyang, they are very willing to restore traffic on the Longhai Railway and are willing to contribute all their labor. In addition, in the Luoyang area, the Luo River can be used, but we must not ignore the strengthening of land transport. Moreover, there are also wheat, cotton, coal, tung oil, and mercury resources produced here. Therefore, in terms of trade with North China and Central China, close consideration should be given to the enrichment of transportation agencies. The people under the rule of Chongqing are most painfully affected by heavy taxes and compulsory conscription, but the Japanese army has now sought appropriate measures in the newly occupied areas to clear up the above-mentioned evils of heavy taxes and compulsory conscription, so that the residents of various places can live in peace in their respective industries, and so on.</p>
<p>American Planes Attacked Zhengzhou, Four Shot Down</p>
<p>Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - At around 9 a.m. on the 2nd, eleven Chongqing (P240) type American fighter planes attacked the vicinity of Zhengzhou and carried out machine gun strafing. Afterward, they attempted to attack the Yellow River Railway Bridge. When they flew over the crossing point, the Japanese army immediately shot them down with fierce artillery fire. Japanese aircraft also mobilized to counterattack. As a result, four enemy planes were shot down, and the rest fled in panic. The Japanese army suffered very little damage. Several local Chinese laborers were killed and injured. This kind of blind bombing by the enemy planes only increases the resentment of the people.</p>
<p>American Missionary Describes the Air Raid Situation</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing Associated Press report, thirteen British and American missionaries arrived in Chongqing on May 13 after enduring hardships during the Henan campaign. At that time, we were already taking a train to Xi'an. The train was moving very slowly, but Japanese planes were bombing day and night. The train we were on had to stop in a dark tunnel for two days. The coal smoke and the smell of breath in the car almost suffocated us. After two days and three nights, we arrived in Xi'an. After living there for two weeks, the fear and fatigue we felt had made us feel hopeless. After arriving in Chongqing, we learned that prices were so high. We thought that there was no way out except to return to our country. Japanese Planes Night Raids on Hengyang and Lingling</p>
<p>Hankou, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force attacked Hengyang and Lingling Chongqing airfields in the deep of night of the 2nd, bombing the runway and auxiliary facilities of Lingling, and destroying a military facility in its parking area. A bomb hit and caused a huge explosion and fire.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Encirclements and Attacks the Chongqing Army at Yasaka</p>
<p>Luoyang, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army's left-wing pursuit teams, after destroying the enemy stronghold of Tancun on the 15th, advanced along the Xiyang Highway. When they reached the vicinity of Yasaka, they discovered 3,000 enemy troops with mortars and immediately took an encirclement and attack posture, achieving a great victory since the start of this campaign. The various units of the Japanese army received a report from scouts that there was an enemy in front of them, and secretly surrounded them from the left and right. At 1 p.m., when the Japanese army was only 300 meters away from the enemy's position on the hills, the enemy discovered that they had been surrounded and fired fiercely with Czech machine guns. The enemy was the 27th Division and the 35th Division of the 38th Army, led by Regiment Commander Zhang Huiming. The embarrassing situation of the Chongqing army fleeing from Shan County to Fushi and Xin'an after being pursued by the Japanese army was still vivid in their minds. After learning the truth, the Japanese army began to attack. While compressing the encirclement from the left and right, they captured 593 enemy troops, including Battalion Commander Chen Jiamou, after only four hours of fierce fighting. The results of this battle are as follows: More than 1,300 enemy bodies were abandoned, 593 prisoners were captured, 4 mortars, 11 heavy machine guns, 63 Czech machine guns, 520 rifles, 35 pistols, 7 telephones, and many other weapons and ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>Translated Review</p>
<h3>The Deepening Grain Problem</h3>
<p>Although the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption" in Nanjing and Shanghai and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Civilian Consumption in Shanghai" have been promulgated, the grain problem is becoming increasingly serious, and the situation has become unavoidable. The Municipal Advisory Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and five other powerful groups have also submitted proposals, and public opinion has been discussing them for days. It is no exaggeration to say that in peacetime areas, social concern is concentrated on the food problem. Regarding the application of the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for Civilian Consumption," there are various opinions and suggestions, such as the need to clearly indicate the guidelines for the procurement price, that the transportation of rice within one stone should be free, that the drawbacks arising from the issuance of passports should be eliminated in order to achieve fairness and speed, and that all exorbitant taxes should be abolished. These are all based on practical considerations and can be adopted or used as references by the authorities. The suggestions of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other five groups also belong to the opinions of the people and should be listened to. But the most important point is whether the authorities have the determination to solve the grain problem according to the previously announced guidelines, and whether they have taken practical measures to implement this determination. If the authorities' guidelines are based only on the general requirement that certain measures must be taken, and they are announced without preparation, then speculators and farmers will certainly despise this decision and arbitrarily monopolize the market. Today is a time when clumsy action is better than slow action, and when even if the best plan cannot be expected, the second-best plan should be thoroughly implemented. If there is a lack of concrete preparation to implement the basic guidelines after they are announced, the temporary psychological benefits will soon disappear. At the same time, it must be understood that the grain problem cannot be solved by entrusting the determination of prices to the possible natural trends, even on the grounds of grain movement. It is undoubtedly true that the rise in prices promotes grain concentration and can self-regulate, but relying on this alone is already unknowable in peacetime, and it is impossible in the current environment. Not to mention speculative hoarders, most farmers who are producers also have an entrepreneurial mentality. In such a situation, it is natural for them to hope that rice prices will rise higher and higher. Although they slowly dispose of the rice they have in hand within the range of preventing market prices from weakening due to increased supply, they will not be tempted to quickly sell it off due to the freedom of movement and today's high prices. If such a situation is allowed to continue, the meaning is to entrust the grain market to speculative merchants and farmers who have already become entrepreneurs. In order to prevent this from happening, I think it is necessary to effectively use administrative power, but do the authorities have sufficient countermeasures? In short, the food problem has a seriousness that cannot be delayed for a day. The authorities should express their enthusiasm and practicality for solving this problem even if they have to handle everything else, and use their power to solve it.

<h3>Japan's Policy Toward China Remains Unchanged - Determined to Provide All Possible Assistance - Ambassador Tani Returns to Nanjing and Speaks to the Press Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Tani returned to Nanjing on June 1 after returning to Japan for important public instructions. At 5 p.m. on the 2nd, he met with the press corps at his official residence and made statements on various issues as follows: This time, I returned to the country at the end of last month to report on current issues and to seek instructions. The Guofang is launching a large-scale campaign in China, and it goes without saying that it is imperative to study measures to adapt to the local situation. New policies toward China have been consistent from beginning to end, and efforts are being made to implement them. For example, on the food issue, if China has any requests, Japan will do its best to provide assistance. Currently, thanks to the enthusiastic efforts of Chairman Chen and other leaders of the National Government, various measures are being promoted smoothly. It is said that salary increases for officials and civil servants at all levels can be realized from July 1. Regarding the food issue, preparations are currently underway to reorganize the Rice Control Committee and the Commerce Control Committee. This matter is closely related to the quality of public security. I believe that after various issues are adjusted, success will be seen in the near future. Regarding the location issue of the Shanghai Embassy Office, its mechanism is also being considered for strengthening and expansion as the war progresses.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Health is Recovering - Foreign Minister Chu Expresses Gratitude</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - National Government Foreign Minister Chu Minyi came to Japan the other day to visit Chairman Wang, who is recuperating. Regarding Chairman Wang's health, the leading figures in the Japanese medical community have been treating him with great care, and he is recovering.

<h3>Cooperating with the War Economy - The Current Focus - Japanese Minister Aoki Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki invited members of the press corps to his official residence on the afternoon of the 2nd for a tea party. He expressed his views on how to overcome various difficulties in the wartime economy of various regions of Greater East Asia, saying: The fundamental purpose of Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere economic policy is twofold: one is a coexistence and co-prosperity economy, and the other is a cooperative war economy. However, the coexistence and co-prosperity economy is clearly a matter for after Japan's victory, so the current focus should still be on the cooperative war economy. If so, then today, the various cooperation of various regions of Greater East Asia with Japan in carrying out the war, whether in the form of materials or money, is extremely important. As Minister Aoki said, "familiar sincerity will lead to delivery," but how to focus on the cooperative war economy, the fundamental difference between Japan and Britain and the United States, is to absolutely exclude the power politics of Britain and the United States, which only care about themselves. In order to enable the economic strength of the Co-Prosperity Sphere to continue to cooperate in the war, it is certainly necessary to revitalize the economy. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood in various regions, it is even more necessary to revitalize the economy. Therefore, the rapid revitalization of local industries that meet local needs is a matter of urgency. Japan is making every effort to provide strong support to various regions in terms of technology, materials, etc. Regarding this, Minister Aoki said that what is possible to revitalize the economy of various regions of Greater East Asia will be implemented immediately, and what is not possible will be made possible in the future, and so on. This statement and this meaning are the fundamental attitude of Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere economic policy under wartime conditions.</p>
<h3>American Troops in Biak - Many Killed and Wounded</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - After American troops landed in Biak, they were fiercely bombed by Japanese army and air force units. Among them, the losses suffered during the battle in Bosnek were the heaviest. The American troops were forced to gather at Bosnek from Harai and Bosnek. This is a narrow coastal area, which is easily attacked by Japanese sniper units, causing the enemy to be completely wiped out. Therefore, the enemy troops were in a state of panic and fled toward Yawii Island. It is learned that the total number of deaths and injuries of the American troops from the start of the landing operation on the 27th to the next day has reached 1,356. MacArthur issued a statement during the landing operation saying, "What I am most pleased with is that our army suffered minor losses. The death toll of 356 is indeed very large, but in his eyes it is still minor."</p>

<h3>Courts Handle Civil Suits, Striving for Speed; Ministry of Justice Instructs Subordinates to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: In judicial cases, the losing party often uses the fact that the case has been appealed as a reason to prevent enforcement.

<h3>The Spirit of New China</h3>
<p>— Written by Yūmatsu Entai</p>
<p>Professor Yūmatsu Entai, a Japanese Buddhist scholar, was invited as a lecturer for the academic lecture series jointly organized by the Xinwen Bao and this newspaper. He arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. Yesterday, he attended a welcome reception held by the Shanghai Buddhist Association and will be giving lectures in various places. Last night at 9:00 PM, he was invited by the Shanghai Broadcasting Station to give a radio lecture. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>As we stand on the streets of Shanghai, looking at the bustling crowds and towering buildings, we can't help but wonder where we really are. Is this the "New China" created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen? Of course, I cannot base this on what used to be an international port. That is a "pretend New China," not the real thing.</p>
<p>National Awakening</p>
<p>So, what is the "spirit of the new country"? It is the "Three Principles of the People" created by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. However, the new spirit of these "Three Principles of the People" is often understood in a very Westernized way, rather than from a Chinese standpoint. The first, "nationalism," is that the Chinese should have a Chinese national consciousness, that they should be inherently Chinese. Even if a Chinese person wears spectacles, smokes cigarettes, and frequents churches, they are still Chinese in the end. No matter how fluent a person is in English, they will still speak the language they were born speaking in their dreams or in times of crisis. Only on top of the inherent spirit can one see spiritual stability. The spirit flowing in the depths of the Chinese soul is connected to the classics of Confucius and Mencius. A classic such as the "Analects" uses the scenery and customs of China as its context, compiled on top of the customs and habits of the Chinese people, a great astronomy that has a permanent life. The way of the sages set by Confucius has truly become the content of the Chinese national consciousness. Such classics are really latent in the depths of your hearts and families. Whether it is Confucianism, Taoism, or Buddhism, it is not in the form of the classics or other remnants. If you deviate from its central spirit, where can you find the nationalism of the new China? Although I am a Buddhist scholar, I often keep a copy of the Analects by my side. But for today's college students and young people, if you talk about Confucius, it's simply not a match, and you will be considered corrupt, because they have no idea of its contents. Some people seem to think that by removing the classics, they can understand the Three Principles. That's because some of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's students were young and tinged with Western ideas. The church schools run by Christianity, which are engaged in China's educational undertaking, are forgetting their ancestors, obliterating the Chinese national consciousness, and creating theories that exclude other yellow races. If "nationalism" is truly profoundly implemented, it will be a revival of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhist classics, and it will lead to the common consciousness of the "Greater Asia" that Dr. Sun Yat-sen spoke of. National consciousness begins with the family, expands to the clan and village, and then expands to the nation and its co-prosperity sphere. It seems to be a kind of destiny. This is a co-prosperity sphere of thought. But China is unfortunate, because it has adopted the compromising path of "using barbarians to control barbarians." So while advocating nationalism, it depends on Britain and the United States. It is said that the leaders in Chongqing have recently felt this contradiction and are paying attention to the Chinese classics. Although they still rely on Britain and the United States for weapons, they have rejected their ideas. They are now in a state of not knowing what to do. But it is commendable that they have noticed this point. As citizens of an allied nation, we are extremely willing to help elevate the Chinese spirit. If it is something related to Chinese-Japanese cultural endeavors, even if it troubles "Japan," we want to do some work for the sake of China. Currently, in the hearts of all parties, one can see that China is restoring the spirit of the classics. This is something to be celebrated greatly. Selling China to Britain and the United States, contrary to the teachings of the Founding Father, is very obvious.</p>
<p>Stability of People's Livelihood</p>
<p>Secondly, when it comes to "the Principle of People's Livelihood," one can directly see the Founding Father's Eastern thought. The important thing for those in power is how to stabilize the lives of all the people. However, to mix this "people's livelihood" with the ideas of the French Revolution and to compare it with the social contract theory and socialism and communism, it seems to have a connection with leftist theories. But this is completely not in line with the Eastern spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. This "Principle of People's Livelihood" starts from the benevolence and righteousness of gentlemen and sages. There is a Buddhist magazine called "Jue You Qing" published in Shanghai, because the Sanskrit word "Bodhisattva" is a translation of those who seek the Tao with altruistic compassion. They are people who are perfect in both self-benefit and benefiting others. Willing to cut half of the bread in their hands to give to the poor, and willing to cut off their own flesh and blood to give to their brothers, this is a Bodhisattva. Sacrificing oneself for righteousness is the work of a gentleman. Putting oneself behind is "benefiting life," "aiding life," "saving life," and "people's livelihood." This is not advocating the equality of mankind. It is when one feels the great compassion of equality in their difference that there will naturally be an organic "people's livelihood." If a virtuous person such as Yan Hui is only concerned about himself, how can he feel that the people are starving? This "people's livelihood" was not invented by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. It is the virtue of "benevolence" of China's 5,000-year tradition. In particular, Chinese Buddhism teaches people to be compassionate and leads to the offering of blessings. Modern China has learned too much materialism and utilitarianism from Britain and the United States, and has been too infatuated with liberalism and hedonism. Therefore, even with regard to this "people's livelihood," it has forgotten the 5,000-year-old way of sages and wants to understand it with materialistic and ego-centric Anglo-American thinking. That is not "the spirit of new China." The spirit of new China is to realize the benevolence and kindness of ancient sages in the modern Chinese political organization. Here, one cannot but consider the revival of the classical spirit.</p>
<p>The Practice of People's Rights</p>
<p>Thirdly, "the Principle of People's Rights" has been distorted after being Westernized, and its thinking has become confused. Since the Republic of China, when has the Westernized "people's rights" been practiced? This matter has also been difficult for Japan. When the parliamentary system was implemented, because it started with Westernized ideas of people's rights, it caused national consciousness to fall into confusion. This kind of "people's rights" is not the theory of "democracy" or "people-based." It is to make the people and hundreds of millions of party members approve of the political will. The East has the politics of kingship and benevolence. It wants to popularize good governance and virtuous rule, and therefore, it is a unified top and bottom, with the upper ranks affecting the lower ranks. This is an organization that is consistent, not to be equated with Anglo-American rights and obligations. The so-called "people's rights" is not to advocate one's own power from the people and restrict the power of those in power. That is inconsistent with the tradition of Eastern politics. Eastern politics must be based on the principle of unity between ruler and minister, top and bottom. Those in power must constantly reflect on themselves, always be based on integrity, fairness, and poverty, always listen to the voice of the people, and strive to recruit talents so that there are no forgotten sages in the wilderness. Today, although much effort has been spent in this China, the complete realization of this politics of kingship has not yet been seen. One of the slogans of the Meiji Restoration was "Make the common people never slack off," and there was also "All matters are decided by public opinion." If the people do not rise up, national power cannot be produced. If Chinese people are met one by one, there are many people with excellent education, but the voice of the people has not been fully heard. The word "people's rights" has almost been used as a synonym for individualism and escapism. Those in power must first cleanse themselves with the way of the sages. What the superiors do, the subordinates will follow. Then, the new life movement of taking the lead will arise. In this way, public opinion will be unimpeded, and public opinion will be gathered. Then, China will unintentionally become a paradise of kingship. In this way, neighboring countries can be preserved, and a new order in Greater Asia can be established.</p>
<p>The above three principles of nationalism, people's livelihood, and people's rights must be divorced from the Anglo-American interpretation and reappear in the original classical spirit of China. Only in this way can the youthful appearance of China appear. How to reproduce the classical essence in modern times, I think this is a task given to China, Japan, and all the nations of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Rice and Grain Specially Approved for Free Transport to Shanghai; Rice Prices Already Dropped Yesterday; The Trend of Our City is Expected to Improve</h3>
<p>The black market price of rice in the city has been soaring for days, greatly affecting the people's food. The municipal government authorities have taken necessary measures to curb the rising trend and stabilize people's livelihood. Before the promulgation of the management measures for the import of rice and grain, merchants and nearby farmers are allowed to transport rice and grain to Shanghai, freely entering various ports of entry, not only without needing to obtain passports and proof slips, but also without restrictions on quantity. It was officially announced yesterday, and the subordinate general agencies were ordered to instruct the police to facilitate it. Consequently, a large amount of rice and grain was transported into various ports of entry, and rice shops in all districts of the city also sold it one after another, and people's hearts were stabilized. Therefore, the black market price immediately fell sharply yesterday morning. With the source of supply unblocked, the rice and grain situation in the city has improved, the rice price is trending downward, and citizens can be free from worry.</p>
<p>In addition, according to Article 2 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for Citizens, the municipal government ordered the registered rice shops to convene an industry association as soon as possible, and to establish purchasing groups according to the distribution of rice shops in the administrative districts of the city. A reporter learned from relevant parties yesterday that rice shops in all districts of the city have been invited to actively organize and elect group leaders to handle rice and grain purchasing matters. As for the candidates, they will be announced after being submitted to the authorities for approval. At the same time, the issue of gold for purchasing rice and grain is also being planned, and it should be decided in the near future and purchasing work will begin. Therefore, in the future, the supply of food rice in the city will be abundant, and there is no need to worry.</p>

Then, Professor Yūmatsu gave a lecture, with the gist being: Buddhism must emphasize a single piece, and it is hoped that Buddhism in Greater East Asia can break down sects and unite closely in the future. It is suggested that a Buddhist university be established in Nanjing or Shanghai. It was reported that Japan plans to build. Jin Shi continued to deliver the lecture, and then the meeting was held. They exchanged opinions during the meeting, which was very harmonious. Xin Shen Liang Bao decided to invite Buddhist monks and laymen from this city to hold a symposium at Jing'an Temple at 3:00 PM today.</p>

<h3>The Economic Bureau Bans the Sale of Coal Briquettes Mixed with Impurities</h3>
<p>The city's Economic Bureau has recently reported that coal briquette merchants have been selling coal briquettes allocated to households mixed with impurities. However, after sending staff to investigate, they blamed the factory for producing inferior products, which is not true. Therefore, on the 1st of this month, all coal briquette merchants were ordered that if they encounter inferior factory goods in the future, they can refuse to accept them. Once they are accepted, it will no longer involve the manufacturer. The merchant in charge is fully responsible, and there must be no more mixed sales. If they dare to violate this, in addition to confiscating their deposit and revoking their qualification as a dealer, they will also be severely punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>The City Propaganda Office Convened the 15th Regular Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday (the 3rd), the City Propaganda Office convened the 15th regular press conference. Reporters from various newspapers and news agencies attended, and the answers from various agencies are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Strengthens Talent Organization</p>
<p>Xin Zhongguo Bao asked: Recently, the government has taken measures to strengthen the personnel organization. Does the municipal government have any adjustments to this? The Secretariat replied: Regarding the strengthening of the personnel organization, this government, since receiving the central government's order, has immediately actively planned to cut redundant personnel and adjust the organization on the one hand, and to raise funds to improve the treatment of employees on the other hand. It can be appreciated soon.</p>
<h3>Preventing Hoarding of Rice</h3>
<p>The New China Newspaper asks: Since the National Government abolished the unified control over rice and allowed free transport and sale, the rice market will inevitably become active. Does the municipal government have specific measures to prevent and punish hoarding and profiteering? Black market rice prices are soaring repeatedly. How will the relevant authorities stop this? The Secretariat replied: Regarding this issue, since the Central Government announced the "Temporary Measures Outline for Food Supply of Residents in Beijing and Shanghai," this government issued a proclamation on May 25th, stating that those who take the opportunity to manipulate, exploit hoarding, and obstruct the people's food supply will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," jointly decided by this government and the Rice Management Committee, has also been promulgated. Various detailed rules are being discussed by the responsible personnel of both parties and will soon be implemented. The current trend of rising prices can be curbed. The Grain Bureau replied: The authorities will not tolerate any illegal acts of unscrupulous merchants hoarding rice and profiteering. The "Rice Management Measures" have been announced, and measures are being carefully planned to stop soaring prices. Starting today, rice can be freely transported in and sold freely in the market, which will eliminate the black market. At the same time, the rice purchased by the Rice Management Committee will also be shipped to Shanghai successively.</p>
<h3>Continued Rationing of Rice for Registered Households</h3>
<p>The China Daily asks: Now that the restrictions on transporting food into Shanghai have been lifted, and free sale is implemented, will the original per capita rationing system continue to be implemented? The Grain Bureau replied: The rationing system is a necessary measure to stabilize people's livelihoods during wartime. Per capita rice rationing has always been undertaken by this government, and the source of rice for rationing is the responsibility of the Rice Management Committee to procure. According to the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," although the rationing system will be slightly revised in the future, it will continue to be implemented. The aim is to ensure that rice transported into Shanghai can be sold fairly to the general public through rice shops, thereby preventing large-scale purchases and hoarding for speculation.</p>
<h3>Preparing for Rationing of Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>The New China asks: Regarding various daily necessities, it is heard that rationing will be implemented. How will the authorities proceed with this work? When will the rationing be implemented? The Economic Bureau replied: It is currently being planned.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Will Be Rationed to Registered Households</h3>
<p>The China Daily asks: The rationing of coal briquettes in the first district has been suspended for more than a month since the end of the fourth phase, and the fifth phase has not yet been distributed. With the summer approaching, citizens rely on coal for fuel. If this continues, it will not only lead to a continuous increase in the black market but also have a significant impact on the lives of citizens. Does the relevant authority have a careful plan for smoothing the source, fair distribution, and reducing the black market? The Economic Bureau replied: Due to discussions on adjusting the rationing price, it is expected that rationing will be possible around the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>New Movement First District Branch Actively Promotes Work Establishes Four Major Work Outlines</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City First District Branch of the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee was established after the recovery of the Public Concession last year and its renaming as the First District. The committee has one director and several members. Under the committee, there is an administrative office, which is actually responsible for the work. The administrative office has one director, two deputy directors, and several group leaders, who handle matters in groups. Initially, the director was concurrently held by Mayor Chen. After Wu Songgao succeeded the head of the First District Office in March of this year, the director of the committee was also changed to be concurrently held by Director Wu. The director of the administrative office is Wang Yiyi, the deputy director of the General Affairs Office of the First District Office, and the district directors are Ling Dating and Lu Yiwei. The previous work of the committee focused on organizing school club departments for all teenagers in the district to establish the First District Branch Regiment Department. Great importance was also attached to promoting general new movement work and thrift propaganda. In the past, the placement of small slogans under the glass tabletops of major restaurants and cafes and the screening of slides in various movie theaters were particularly praised by the general public. Recently, five-color and six-lacquer propaganda signs have been installed in busy streets and alleys to spread the message widely. It is heard that the committee's future work will shift from propaganda to practical action. On the opening day of the conference, ten propaganda teams will be organized to conduct thorough propaganda in busy streets and alleys. Secondly, to encourage the organization of public and private groups in the district. The New Movement Practice Group has now formulated details on rewarding the eradication of undesirable children's reading materials and obscene songs and dramas. Fourth, to cooperate with the epidemic prevention movement, detailed measures have been formulated, which will be implemented separately soon.</p>
<h3>Health Exhibition Enthusiastic Visitors</h3>
<p>The city's Health Movement Congress and Health Exhibition were enthusiastically visited. The city's Health Movement Congress and Health Exhibition both opened at 10:00 AM on the 1st of this month. The exhibition displayed various fly and mosquito eradication tools, as well as specimens of human physiology, pathology, and animal pathology, which were particularly valuable. The association was originally scheduled to be open as usual yesterday, but the Shanghai Sports Association happened to hold a competition yesterday afternoon, so the exhibition was closed in the afternoon. Several doctors and nurses were stationed at each exhibition site to provide citizens with inquiries at any time. It was originally scheduled to be closed today, but to meet the needs of citizens, it was still open in the morning and closed in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Readers' Scholarship News</h3>
<p>Methods for Schools to Collect Application Forms</p>
<p>The 7th session of scholarship funds for students have been announced at the 30th of May. Cooperation has been formally requested from the authorities, but due to recent problems with postal work the documents have yet to be sent and there have been so many inquiries that it is hard to keep up, this is why the school can collect the application forms on their behalf to redistribute. All students of university-level institutions and below, who: (A) are from a poor family, (B) are of good character and health, and (C) have excellent academic records, with an average score in the top third of their grade, or who have special expertise and are worthy of further study, may register with the school they are attending before June 10th. The school authorities must carefully review the registered students and refuse to recommend those who do not meet any of the three items under A, B, and C. Those who are indeed qualified and can be recommended should first be registered, and then a letter should be prepared listing the number of people in each grade to collect the application forms from the scholarship office and distribute them to the students to fill out. This letter must be delivered by June 15th at the latest. The number of application forms collected by each school should not exceed 5% of the number of students, but some flexibility can be granted to schools with more students receiving assistance from this company. This is a last resort restriction, and it is expected that even after this restriction, a large number of applicants may still not be approved. Rather than disappointing the majority of students later, it is better to impose some restrictions beforehand. It is hoped that the school authorities will understand this intention. The office is scheduled to start issuing application forms on June 12th. Due to the inevitable errors in mailing, it is best for each school to prepare a letter and send someone to pick them up.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony Donation to Scholarship The China Silk Company will open on the 7th. It will first announce to all colleagues and friends in the industry that the congratulatory gifts will be converted into cash and used for scholarships to save costs. It turns uselessness into usefulness, which is very meaningful and admirable. The letter said: "Our company is scheduled to open on June 7th. In these extraordinary times, we should save costs. We hereby inform all colleagues and friends in the industry that we will accept cash gifts instead of congratulatory gifts and transport them to Shenbao and Xinwenbao for scholarships. Our company will no longer accept gifts. Furthermore, our company will not prepare refreshments on the opening day. All these expenses will be converted into 20,000 yuan of national currency, which will be donated to Shenbao Scholarship and Xinwenbao Loan Scholarship, 10,000 yuan each, to create benefits for all those who send congratulatory gifts. In addition to publishing another announcement, we are sending a silk industry check for 10,000 yuan in national currency. Please check and issue a receipt."</p>
<p>Gift Donated to Scholarship Mr. Cui Junyou's son, Zhao Guang, recently celebrated the joy of having a daughter. He used the congratulatory money from relatives and friends for charity and scholarships, which is commendable. The letter said: "Recently, my granddaughter turned one month old. I am grateful for the congratulatory gifts from all relatives and friends and should express my gratitude. However, considering the difficult times and the need to save materials, I will allocate the saved banquet funds to charity to create benefits for all relatives and friends. In addition to donating to the Guangdong Shanghai Native Place Association for distributing sauce and medicine and the Zhenjiang Yamen Nursery in Panyu Changrui Hall for distributing rice, I am now sending 10,000 yuan in national currency to your newspaper and Xinwenbao to be used for scholarships. Please check and give us a receipt, we will be grateful."</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday China Silk Company (saved expenses from the opening ceremony) 10,000 yuan, Cui Junyou (saved banquet funds from the one-month celebration of his granddaughter) 10,000 yuan, Li Heqin (rewarded Mr. Mi's donation of redemption money) 3,000 yuan, Tang Chengde, Li Jingfan (saved banquet funds for his son's one-month celebration), Fu Ji Slaughter Company Lu Alin 1,000 yuan each, Tang Wenrong 100 yuan. A total of 26,100 yuan in savings bonds was received, and the balance is 2,337,642 yuan.</p>

<p>Notice is hereby given that the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents" have been promulgated.

<p>June 2nd, 33rd year of the Republic of China Mayor Chen Gongbo</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special City Government Notice Shanghai City No. 5575</h3>
<p>Notice is hereby given that in accordance with Article 2 of the "Temporary Measures for the Management of Rice for Shanghai Residents," "For the purpose of implementing this law, the municipal government orders the registered rice shops to establish procurement groups according to administrative districts. Each group shall have one leader designated by the rationing household rice agency." The rice shops registered in this city should immediately convene a meeting of the same industry to establish procurement groups separately according to the distribution of rice shops in each administrative district of this city. The candidates for group leaders shall first be recommended by the same industry, three to five people per group, and submitted to the Municipal Grain Bureau and the First District Public Relief Office for joint approval. As for the funds required for the procurement of rice, in accordance with the provisions of Article 13 of the aforementioned Management Temporary Measures, in principle, the procurement merchants and rice shops shall prepare their own funds. However, in order to encourage the righteous distribution of rice for the people and to consider the difficulties of merchants, if there is indeed insufficient capital, they may apply to the Municipal Government to negotiate with the bank for loans. All rice merchants should comply with this notice.</p>

<h3>National Forum A Thorough Solution to the Livelihood of Teachers and Staff</h3>
<p>— Yang Ti</p>
<p>The poverty of teachers' lives is an undeniable fact. Recently, with soaring prices, the difficulty of their lives has become even more severe. The authorities are deeply aware of the situation, so they have launched this initiative to collect living allowance fees from students' parents. My fellow teachers are truly like receiving timely rain after a long drought and are all grateful.</p>
<p>But on closer thought, there are great difficulties in realizing this approach and achieving effective results. The biggest problem lies in the inability to arouse the sympathy of the general parents in practical action. They believe that the tuition fees collected by the schools are mostly already quite high. How can they still cry about the poverty of teachers' lives and want to solve this problem? Of course, they cannot plan on asking the parents for help again. One more point: eight or nine out of ten students' parents in general schools are salaried workers with limited income. At this time when everything is expensive, they may have the same lack of livelihood as the poor teachers. Then, it is unreasonable and unkind to ask them to help each other in their illness. Even if some parents can express deep sympathy, they are also limited. There is too little porridge and too many monks. How much can each person get? A drop in the bucket, I am afraid it will not help. Therefore, there are countless schools in the city, but only thirteen schools officially follow the authorities' approach (Lin Bureau Chief's conversation on the 23rd), and the others are still hesitating.</p>
<p>In short, the facts can tell us that although the authorities have good intentions, it is not easy to achieve the ideal goal. Moreover, this is just a temporary solution. To seek a fundamental solution, we still need the authorities to make further efforts. I hope that with political power, they will order each school's finances to be open and organize a school finance investigation committee to review the actual number of each school's financial income and expenditure budget, etc., and distribute the surplus equally to teachers and staff, so that the principal will not monopolize the profits. In this way, there will be no capitalist-style principals and slave-style teachers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the current corruption of education is also an undeniable fact. The problem lies in the fact that most teachers have a fleeting thought of changing their minds because of the poverty of their lives, and they cannot regard education as a lifelong career. Therefore, they cannot concentrate on the development and improvement of education, and it is inevitable that it will gradually become corrupt. If the authorities can implement the above method and solve the teachers' living problems to a minimum, then the teachers can live in peace and devote their energy to the progress of their careers, and the development of education is also a matter of course. As for the solution to the living allowance fees for teachers and staff this semester, we can also refer to the above method, and evenly divide the number of economic surpluses of each school to teachers, and be sure to prevent teachers from being exploited and treated harshly by the principals. Finally, if the authorities issue a decree and there are schools that cannot comply with it, the authorities can send personnel to take over as an effective method. If this is the case, the problem of teachers' lives can be thoroughly resolved.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I have read an article in the Citizen Forum of your newspaper on May 30, entitled "Give a Real Example." Our association has previously prepared a method for the allocation of glutinous rice for winemaking in various places, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. On January 5 of this year, we telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau to transfer and summon winemakers from various places to come to the meeting to receive it. After that, glutinous rice was distributed successively, and the winemaking industry associations in Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places are on file. According to Article 8 of the above-mentioned method, "The Rice Control Committee shall allocate the rice to the associations according to the prescribed price, and the difference between the price sold by the association and the price sold by the public shall be transferred by the Rice Control Committee to the Executive Yuan for the purpose of rewarding increased production." It was found this time that the Wujiang Winemaking Industry Association procured glutinous rice by itself, which is obviously a violation of this regulation. It was sent to the Wujiang District Office to investigate and collect the difference. It is in accordance with the order that the office is handling the matter, if there is no other evidence of overstepping the war, it is inappropriate. Please correct your newspaper. Sincerely, Rice and Grain Control Committee.</p>

<h3>From Thrift Movement To Coarse Cloth Short Clothes</h3>
<p>In this extraordinary period, many people have taken off their long gowns and put on short clothes in response to the thrift movement. This is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon! Originally, the materials used for long gowns accounted for about twice as much as those for short clothes. At this time of difficulty in obtaining half a thread or half a strand, it is an unnecessary waste, and it is not as easy to do things in long gowns as it is to walk lightly and move quickly in short clothes. However, I think that the best clothing material now is cotton cloth, which can be rationed, and it is best to use coarse cloth, because it is both economical and durable, and it meets the principles of thrift everywhere. If we can all wear coarse cloth short clothes, it will not only revitalize the domestic industry, prosper the rural economy, but also enrich the society. (Lu Ren)</p>

<h3>Letter to My Sister (7) Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Baoyan Kunio, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>The cape on the left is deeply embedded in the shadows of the mountains, and there is a strip of blue sea in the middle. A strange thing appeared from this place. To use a mythological adjective, it is the Sumomo in the Nilielgen story. To use a prosaic analogy, it is like a factory in the Jiangdong area rushing into the sea during floods. Because it was moving, Longfu thought it must be a ship. While he was wondering what it was, the shadow left the cape and, with white waves, advanced towards the sea in front. Its speed was very fast - (like a warship.)</p>
<p>Fu saw the flag fluttering on the ship. In a short time, its posture under the sunlight could be seen clearly. A hull like a long iron bridge appeared. The turret of the main gun appeared.</p>
<p>(It's a heavy cruiser!)</p>
<p>Longfu also had some common sense and understood the difference between warships. In his mind, the knowledge he had gained from "Navy" magazine and the warship photo album of the Yushinkai naturally appeared.</p>
<p>(Oh, it seems to be a Takao-class warship!)</p>
<p>He felt like his spirit was exhausted. And in his heart, he wanted to dance and stomp his feet. Because he was still a student in the military group, only the Takao-class warship was the warship he had always dreamed of. The great and majestic appearance of the new heavy cruiser captured his heart more strongly than any warship photo. Its tonnage, armament, and speed, until now, are firmly remembered in his heart like the face of a lover.</p>
<p>(The Takao-class warship is speeding in front of my eyes.)</p>
<p>He forgot everything and was intoxicated with happiness. When the fleet entered the port of Kagoshima, even though his eyes were wide like eggs, he never saw the warship. Today, he finally saw it. "It's really dangerous... It's a good ship!"</p>
<p>Due to the intense emotion, he blurted out these words. This warship was completely like wearing dark blue armor and set off to the front line with great majesty. He stared blankly at this posture and was lost in thought. After a while, he unintentionally began to grope back and forth in the yukata bag he had rented from the inn. He was groping for his sketchbook, which he always carried with him.</p>
<p>However, despairing of painting, he had not even brought a pencil on this trip. At the same time, he clearly knew that even if he had brought a pencil, he could not sketch here because it was a fortress area. But, his hand still continued to grope in his pocket. The shadow of the giant ship floated on the horizontal line, until it was blocked by the shadow of the cape on the right. Longfu's fingers were moving, groping up and down his chest.</p>
