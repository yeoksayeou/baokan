<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國靑年的苦悶</h3>
<p>靑年的心理是前進的，而富於情感的。有前進之心，必定有前進的目標和希望；但是在前進的路上遭過到障礙，受到了打擊，因而不能立時達到所期望的時候，就很容易被情感所衝動，很容易發生苦悶。</p>
<p>就靑年對於國家而言，靑年是國民之中愛國最烈的一部分，他們所愛的國家，是全部的，是整個統一的。他們在小學校裹所讀的課本，是愛祖國，愛民族國家；在中學校裹所受到的教育，所受到的薰陶，也是愛祖國，愛民族國家，並且他們更進一步知道國家分裂的悲慘；歷史並教以弱而復強亡而複興的例子是多少難得，多少艱苦，所以他們更不願意遭遇歷史再重演於自己所最親愛的祖國。至於大學呢，更不必說了，政治學經濟學歷史學上，各種講義教材裹邊，都給以寶貴的教訓，對於自己的祖國，有了更進一步的認識。他們的心理是天眞的，他們的理想是純粹的，他們的熱血是可寶貴的，他們祇有一個目標。。「祖國祇有一個」。但是，他們有他們的國家理想，同時又看到今日國家的現實，理想與現實又不能合致為一，反形成絕大的矛盾，矛盾就是他們的障礙和打擊，於是他們內心之中，就發生第一個最大的苦悶。</p>
<p>再就教靑而論，靑年不但是願意受學校教育，並且是應該受最低基礙以上的教育，他們有的是志向，是遠大的願望，希望將來能够貢獻於社會國家，替人類服務。惟其如此，所以對自己所應受的教育，特別發生與趣，也惟其如此，所以對於自己的將來，抱有更遠大的抱負。其急切的求學志願，是國家前途良好的現象。但是事實又怎樣呢？物價的日趨高漲，生活的愈益困難，這是助成靑年求學的願望呢？還是摧毀它？教師的日形困苦，書本之入手日難，這還是助成靑年求學的願望呢？還是摧毀它？凡此種種，都是與靑年求學的理想背道而馳，都是理想與現實之間的矛盾，矛盾就是他們的障礙和打擊，於是他們內心之中，就發生了第二個最大的苦悶。</p>
<p>靑年的苦悶決不止於此，這僅僅是苦悶中的最大者而已。靑年的苦悶一天不得解決，則靑年的力量就一天得不到導引發揮。所以，全國無數靑年的苦悶，政府責任所在，自應設法解除。尤共是政府中領導靑年運動者更有注意反省的必要。</p>
<p>可是，苦悶的環境和苦悶的精神是兩件事，目前的環境，誠是苦悶；然而靑年的精神，仍應振作。決不應受環境所支配。根據教育界的意見，本學期各大學的入學試騐，成續此較以往為差，這是靑年精神不能振作的明證。所以，在政府方面，當然有替靑年解除苦悶的實任，而靑年方面，也應振作精神，創造新環境，不受　環境所支配。</p>
<h3>日臨時議會揭幕　兩院開全體會議　通過對陸海軍感謝敬弔案</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　第八十五次臨時會，於六日舉，是日貴，衆兩院議員均於上午九時前陸續到達會塲，貴族院於十時三分集含於會塲，首先介紹新議員　政會總說小林躋造大將後，決定各部屬各部長理事等，過五分鐘散會，衆議院於十時十五分集於會塲，決定各部屬各部長理事等後，三十分散會，八十五次臨時議會即日成立，完成決戰議會準備。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日臨時議會六日揭幕，貴院舉行開院典禮後，一時半開始全體會議，議決奉答勅語文，因松平議長抱病缺席，乃推舉臨時議長佐佐本，副議長推舉德川圈順公爵，全塲一致通過。繼由小磯首相演說一般施政方針，陸海兩相報告戰况，幷提出對陸海軍之感謝敬弔案。由島津忠重公爵說明提案理由，全塲一致通過，陸海兩相分別致謝辭，嗣轉入對國務大臣之演說，舉行質疑問答，由大河內正敏子爵（研究會），水野甚次郎（交友俱樂部）兩氏登壇質問，旋即散會。衆院於十一時開始全體會議，議決奉答勅語文後，推選全院委員長及各當任委員，少事休息，待貴院議事完畢後，繼續開會，由小磯首相舉行一般施政演說，陸海兩相報吿戰況，幷提出對陸海兩軍感謝敬弔案，全塲一致通過，陸海兩相分別致謝辭，以時間關係，對國務大臣演說之質疑，改在七日舉行，旋即散會。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日衆議院各常任委員之選定及起草委員之決定，由翼政會議會職員擔任之，六日議會職員會議中，已選擇定各委員候補及各委員長候補者如次：勅語奉答文起草委員長河上哲太，全院委員長柴安新九郎，預算委員長勝田永吉，決算委員三浦虎雄，建議委員長宮澤裕，懲罰委員長一宮房治郎。</p>
<p>日各項豫算案內容</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府第八十五次臨時議會將提出之臨時軍事費特別會計以下預算各案，經各省折衝後已獲成案，於五日交定例閣議討論，幷經石渡藏相作詳細說明後，議決當日下午奏呈後，下午五時幷由情報局發表之，茲誌其內容如次：　臨時軍事費特別會計豫算追加案，　昭和十九年（民國二十二年）度歲入歲出總豫算追加案，　公債及煤　需給調節兩特別會計豫算以外國庫負担之契約事件，其中直接戰昔之臨時軍事費追加額為二百五十億元。昭和十九年度此項會計追加額之累計數額與第八十四次議會決定者，合計寶述六百三十億元之鉅，與昭和十八年度之　加額相較，激增三百六十億元，戰時財政萬全體制，於此已具，同時，並決定關系大藏省經費之一般會計追加豫算，包括農商省之食糧，煤薪增產及臨時議會用費，其歲入歲出總額為三億八千五百四十四萬四千元，故今年度一般會計豫算加入此次追加額，實達二百〇五　五千八百萬元。其次，公　特別會計追加豫算案，約為五十二億，決定發行新價券，以充此次臨時軍費追加豫算，此外，豫算以外國庫所負祖之契約支出，豫定為六億三千九百餘萬元，包括食糧煤薪增產之五億元及次年度耕地改良費，以上連同臨時軍費，一般會計及各特別會計之追加豫算，幷第八十四次議會通過者，合計總額為八百三十五億五千八百萬元，扣除得複經費七十二億五百萬元後，計為七百六十三億五千二百萬元，與昭和十八年度之三百七十億九十餘萬元相較，本年實增加三百九十二億元之　。臨時軍事費决發行公債</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日本臨時議會中，將提出之臨時軍事費追加豫算案，計為二百五十億元，其中經常費為二百億元，預備費為五十億元，此款自南方開發金庫中借貸及公債雜收中　集之。茲分其內容如下（百萬元為單位），南方開發金庫借款（一九二〇〇），公債（五一九七），雜收（一六〇二），開發金庫借款之二百八十二億，已達臨時軍事追加豫算之七成。此項豫算乃根據大陸興南方戰費之增大而成，本年之南方開發金庫借款累計為二百五十二億元，南方住民對於完遂大東亞戰之負擔愈形加重。中國事變以來，迄今臨時軍費預算之累計，為一千三百七十一億二千八百餘萬元。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府於此次舉行第八十五屈臨時議會之前一日，提出本年度一般特別預算追加案，並發表臨時軍事預算追加額為二百五十億圓，此與前內閣決定之臨時軍費追加預算三百八十億元，合計總額已達六百三十億圓之鉅，外加本年度之一般特別費會計額，合計達七百六十三億三千萬，該額之半數以上，已決定發行八債。按此次臨時軍費追加預算案，與過去第一次日淸戰時之二億二千萬元，日俄戰時三十三億四千萬元，此由中日事變第一年度之二十億二千萬元，但較其後相差實大，由此亦可知此次預算之鉅大數額中，值人注意者。其中百分之七十以上，係發行南方開發金庫及目共榮圈各地域之借款，百分之二十以上係公俊金。</p>
<h3>日小磯首相重要演說　定今日在議會發表</h3>

<p>滇緬前綫日軍某某基地六日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍航空隊為接濟北緬騰越方面友軍軍需，於三日出動途中與渝軍小型機一架相遇，日戰鬥機隊當即將其擊落，至於該地渝軍飛機塲發見大型機數架，即加以轟炸，渝機二架起火，三架被炸毀，日機安然歸還。</p>

<h3>當塗與江寗兩實騐縣區一瞥閔賢</h3>
<p>最近國府選定江寗崑山嘉興當塗南滙五縣為實騐縣區。記老此次因赴蕪湖之使，特在當塗江寗兩縣逗留數日。「兩縣均在京蕪綫上」，關於兩縣沿革及幅員，恕不贅述，僅記見聞如次：當塗景色</p>
<p>記者一出當　車站，即發生良好印數，篇該地馬路相當淸潔，道旁樹木亦尙整齊，路之附近山水相間，風景宣人，路遇檢查行旅之武裝同志，亦頗彬彬有禮。市街上米號不少，大多附設一錢莊，該地為產米地區，附設錢莊，無非為大量採辦米糧便利計也。隨即沿京蕪綫往慈湖采石馬鞍山等附近農村巡禮，籍便得多與農民懇談，得悉該縣比年以來，收成均佳，畢田每畝約收稽三担至四担，水田約收四担至五担，生活均安適，該縣市鄉人民並具有一特色，即大都安心，而信任當局，原來該縣事變以來，治安頗佳，匪徒雖未完全絕跡，然因全縣各鎭鄉均敷設有電話網，任何地方一有匪警，隨時即有保安團隊趕往勦除，聞此項記備相當精良之保安團隊約有二百餘人，並有卡車數輛汽艇數艘，水陸行軍，均甚便利，以是匪徒斂跡，多往鄰縣。此類設備，聞為談縣警察局長現並無理縣長之張氏所創辦，「張氏在該縣甚久，會經國府明令嘉獎，並給獎金二十萬元」，其經費則係由田賦上加所謂保安附加捐而來，「該縣田畝總計六十三萬畝」，人民因得安居並無怨辭，可見取之於民，而用之於民者，必為人民所稱道也。惟教育狀况則甚低落，全縣現方創辦一初級中學，其他如民衆教育館及體育塲等有關文化事業，均未加注重，僅應景而己。人民因生活較為安適，以致賭風甚熾，勝負動輒數萬金，都市人見之亦當咋舌。當局對於衝字總算相當做到，但對於教字似未能願及，想將來推行實騐縣政時，教養衛三字應同時邁進。江寗一瞥</p>
<p>離當塗縣境，仍沿京蘇綫而達江寗縣境之江寗鎭，該鎭約百餘戶人家，記者到鎭時方午後七時，即發現人民杌隍不安之狀，原來該鎭附近之樓蘭鎭（亦江寗縣屬）匪共正在猖獗，一夕數驚，巳經數日，與民人談話時，大多信念動搖，環境使然也。記者復沿京蕪公路轉道南京，到達江寗縣城，表面上雖無不寗之狀，但與民人接談時，大多問你從那鄉來，那鄉怎麼樣了。總之治安既不確保，思想自難肅正，江寗之先天性較當送差多矣，將來當局施行實騐縣政，勢必較費功夫，想當局實施鄉村建設。而以實騐縣區為單位，或另有補救之道也。</p>

<h3>巴爾幹局勢發展　蘇聯對保國宣戰　事前係獲得英美同意</h3>
<p>瑞典京城六日中央社急電　海通社引莫斯科無錢電消息稱，蘇聯已向保加利亞宣戰。蘇聯已將宣戰牒文遞交保國駐蘇公使史違梅諾夫，略稱，三年來保國協助德國對蘇作戰，目前復以根據地供給德國建立抵抗陣錢，因此蘇聯政府遂不得不對保宣戰。保國公使立即將牒文內容報告本國政府，昨日午後五時（莫斯科時間）蘇保兩國間已進入戰爭狀態。</p>

<h3>宣戰背景</h3>
<p>百倫六日中央社電　德國社訊：頃由接近希臘公使館之人士獲悉有關蘇聯向保宣戰之情形如下：蘇聯向保宣戰之際，正英美幾將與保結束停戰談判之時。談判困難之點，即前保政府不願將通入愛琴海之達特亞加傑（Dede　Agach）及加伐拉（Kayalla）交還與希臘，而英國則曾於十八月前在開羅允諾希臘恢復該兩地，因而堅持保國須將該兩地交還。保之新舊政府對此意見互異，而蘇聯以爲保若對英美讓步，不帝不允蘇聯向保國在獲得愛琴海之出口，因此蘇聯向保宣戰，以便從速侵保而獲得愛琴之出口。</p>
<h3>保國求和</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹六日中央社電　德國社訊：據倫敦廣播稱，保加利亞政府頃已要求蘇駐保公使館轉請蘇聯政府停戰，保外部秘書長薩拉伏夫曁保外部政治股主任阿爾丁諾夫，曾往訪蘇聯駐索菲亞代辦，聲明渠等已奉保政府之命，要求蘇聯政府休戰。</p>
<h3>德方評論</h3>

<h3>蘇土關係復起變化</h3>
<p>百倫六日中央社電　德國社訊，據此問報紙載稱：最近羅馬尼亞與巴爾幹半島之局勢發展，已使土國感覺惴惴不安，其原因乃蘇聯對土之態度有變化。雙方關係於最近經過短時期之改善後似已復趨含糊，蘇土新約之談判已中止。</p>

<h3>比境反軸心軍　向沿海推進　康煦河畔戰事熾烈</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：前日反軸心軍在西綫作戰主要目標，仍在迫德軍進入海峽沿海。英第二軍之坦克車隊經白魯塞爾後，現已進抵安特　普區與些耳德河（The　Scheldt），其他敵軍則轉向西北與西面推進，壓迫德軍在些耳德河中游與上游及立士河（The　Lys）所建之障碍陣地。加拿大軍隊則進攻康煦河（TheCanche）之德軍障碍陣地，酣戰甚烈，敵軍在各該段迄無任何進展。美第一軍左翼在桑白爾與繆斯河之間向北進政，因受德軍之堅强抵抗，亦來能達到目的。反軸心軍頃復增強對繆司與摩塞爾間之壓力，美軍坦克車企圖突入羅林盆地，現正遭遇德軍堅强反攻，梅茲與南錫前晚仍在德軍手中。</p>
<p>德軍策略保衛本土柏林六日中央社電　德國當局五日就西綫戰局表明見解如次：西部戰綫德軍已臨嚴重關頭，刻德軍之任務，　在將法國德軍調回本土，　在取得時間，　在構築陣地待機反攻。至於調回法國德軍之事，應隨德軍指導部臨機而作，取得時間問題。乃為達成第三項任務之前提條件，因此德軍這撤退作戰，應甚於嚴密之計劃遂行之。</p>

<h3>從蘇聯歸來</h3>
<p>筆者在德蘇開戰三周紀念日後不多幾天的七月十二日離俄京。當時莫斯科市民所關心者，並成爲話題之中心者，「戰爭似乎快近結束了……」。蘇維埃市民何以以爲戰爭快近結束呢？面爲所謂第二戰綫開闢了的緣故。俄諺有云：「縱有諾言，亦不能不待三年」，實際上，蘇聯人民自從聽信了英美聯合國的第二戰綫的諾言以來，等待其實行，確已有三年之久了</p>
<p>蘇軍之不能不與德軍繼續苦戰，也因爲英美不履行第二戰錢的諾言，蘇聯的指導者乃向人民苦苦辯解，故一聞英美軍開始登陸北法之報後，即簡單地以為戰爭也快近結束了，道不是偶然的，無理的。</p>
<p>蘇聯人民是那樣地期待着第二戰線的實現。記者所熟悉的一老媼，喜色滿面地向記者謂：「昨天被召，明日即將除隊歸來了，因爲今日第二戰線業已開闢的緣故。」</p>
<p>蘇聯人民在過去三年的苦戰中，確已臥新嘗胆地熬苦過來。希望早一點結束戰爭的意思，橫溢充塞於國民的各階層間，但如其以為他們對敵人的憤怒，燃燒般熱烈的復仇心，略見低下，那就太過了。政府因搔着了國民的憤怒與復仇心的　處，而鞭韃了國民疲勞的身心。這都是實在的情形。</p>
<h3>死傷者一千五百萬</h3>
<p>德國攻得固然厲害，但蘇聯的確守得也好。東部戰線的廣大戰塲，如何變成大規模的屠人塲呢？過去三年間，兩軍死傷合計每日平均一萬五千人以上，總計將達一千五百萬人左右。歐俄那一片廣大的戰塲地帶，隨地可以掘得塊葬着的敵我不辨的屍體。至於成爲火巷之市的都市，殆成爲不見人跡的廢墟，要辨尋昔日的街道，極爲困難。莫斯科郊外約六十公里的伊斯托拉鎭，戰前是建有瓦屋數百間的綺麗的田家鎭，但從庫壁希夫回到莫斯科，舊地重臨，則因該地在一九四一年冬莫斯科攻防戰時，因成爲兩軍所發出鎗砲火之標的，故現在完整無缺的家舍，一無所存，屋頂次飛，牆壁傾圯，祇剩建築物四面的骨幹，被砲烟燻得靑黑，而如虛墟中到處聳立着的墓碑。斯達林格勒市爲伏爾伽河畔順利發展起來的新興工業都市，但視察該市慘狀的某俄人向記者謂：「該市內免於戰火的破壤而完整無缺者，全市不過二十六家。」</p>
<h3>女子航空兵與戰車兵</h3>
<p>曾展開激烈戰鬧的山丘，被兩岸亂射的炸彈砲彈，竟使山容變色。其激烈，悽慘之狀，實非筆墨所能形容。男子擔任第一綫，女子擔任後方的蘇維埃人民，從事這種激烈的戰爭，已經三年了。男子的動員，在農村方面最爲激烈。家內所剩，非十三四歲以下的孩子，即爲六七十歲的老人。更有女的村長，女的戶長。頭上結着頭巾的年靑婦人，架駛着貨車，橡膠軍的颯爽的姿勢，無論到那一個村鎭去都可以見到。</p>
<p>都會裏，祇衙門及重要軍需工廠，尚有相當數　的適齡被召的男子工作著。例如電車的開車，殆全部為二三十歲左右的女人。能夠牽引五六噸貨車—四五十輛車的大機車，有人看見其駕駛沓的交通。擔任炭鑛夫，旋盤工，土工等組重工作的女人也不少。蘇聯女子且不僅守衛後方，並為航空兵，戰車兵，狙擊兵，高射砲隊，軍醫，看護兵等，與男子並肩立在槍林彈雨的第一綫前。其正確的數字雖不可知，但據專門家推算，達百萬人以上。</p>
<p>假使沒有蘇聯女性之獻身的努力與不遜於男性的活躍，恐不能防住此次的戰爭罷！（作者為朝日新聞社莫斯科分局長畑中政春）（翔：譯自八月十八日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>注意實在警報</p>
<p>（戊）其他：　此次訓練，如聞鳴放汽笛，當知並非訓練警報，而為實在警報，須從速採取應付辦法。　九月九日星期六，爲舊歷七月二十二日，月出九月九日下午十一時五十二分，月沒九月十日下午三時十二分，　應勸導保甲自警團員，及一般市民穿着防空服裝，務使隨時隨地均可伏臥待避，面無妨碍。　電筒光度，應在一支光以下，並常用下列色澤不同之布料，連掩發光部，務使簡光平射，在三百公尺以外，任何一點皆不辨認，目無論何時，絕對不得與地面成十五度以上之角度，向上照射。電筒遮光布料色澤，區別如左！一，軍用電筒赤色，二，官（包括警官在內）用電筒黃或橙色，三，民（包括保甲團體及自警團在內）用電筒靑或綠色。但希望警察消防及從事救護之人員，在職務上緊急不得已時，於必要之最低限度以內，得　用電筒。　　報發令時之交通管制，尤須嚴密實施。</p>

<h3>物配處訂定敎職員　特種配米辦法　公私立學校同等待遇</h3>
<p>本市物品配給處，秉承市長意旨，爲輛助各校教職員工生活之不足，爰即辦理教職員特種配給金米，訂定辦法，呈准市府施行。茲將各情誌後：</p>
<p>米作學費不得申請</p>
<p>教職員特種配給食米辦法。旨在解除各校敎職員工生活上之威脋，直接間接亦所以扶助本市教育之發展，是以儿市區以內之各級學校，無論　立市立公立，以及教育部或市教育局所認可之各私立學校教職員工，均得依照辦法，向該處由請配給。但各校向學生已實際收取食米作爲學費者，不得申請、</p>

<h3>前工部局華童學校之敎育性格</h3>
<p>— 上野太忠</p>
<p>手工課程</p>
<p>中學各校，對於手工課程，向極重視。聶中丞公學，目以發展手工教育爲立校目標之一。校內有設備完善的工塲，每天有很多學生，在那裏滿足活動的衝動，發展實際的精神。但手工究與勞作不同，前者至少偏於個人的被動的筯肉的，後者　重於羣衆的自動的手腦並用的。所以小學更進一步，謀勞作與其他各科的聯絡，在自佐料科與當織科中，有把上課「聽　」，進而至於「手做」的趨勢。當然教材也大部分是自編的，如世界書局出版的那　自然　　……社會教材……以及春秋書局的中級常識等，大都可興勞作科聯絡教學。</p>
<p>音樂和美術的教學　　中學無論初級或高級，對於審美及發表思想感情創作力的美術音樂等科目，大都付之闕如，即一支簡單的校歌，也不大聽見有人去唱。校內也很少見有學生美術創作的發表或陳列。足學校大部分的時間，只是將智識注入到學生的頭　中去，極難得　到學生的情操方面。但七所小學，在華人教育處領導下，對於此種課程，却又特別注意，曾聘請專家研究，所編音樂集，低中高三種，適合各學年程度，風行全市，至今採用。而美術科的發展，從靜的圖畫雕刻模型建築等工作，進而至於活的戲劇設計，如現在上海風行的木偶劇，即脫胎於當年華人教育處活動本人的設計和創導。至今各木偶劇團的主持人，還是當年教育處的人員。</p>
<p>體育課程</p>
<p>英國人向以重視體育見稱，以爲良好的公民，應該在運動塲上養成，因的人，沒有把整個的精神帶到蓮童中學去。幾十年來，並沒有　到對於體育有顯著的重視。有關體育的活動，也絕少僅見。雖儘有很多國內體育界先進，在華童公學任教，可是他們主要的，並不是教體育，大部分時間，倒教的是英文或其他科目，下課以後，學生們不准逗留教室內，一齊要到操塲上去，可是操塲上去做些什麼？散步閒談而已，少有集體的運動。至於學生一律需穿的制服，是一項長舌帽，一件布長衫。行走時便有些累贅不便。穿了這種長制服上運動塲，可想見英人對於州學生體育之居心了。小學體育科，重在從生活習慣方面，鍛鍊兒童的體格，養成優良的德行。對於運動技能方面，則列入次要。集體的活動，較中學為多。童子軍的訓練，也曾風行一時。過事變以後，因學校運動塲的限制，體育活動，也多寂然無聞。應　英雄無用武之地。</p>
<h3>淮南產煤　源源運滬</h3>
<p>頃據關係當局傳出消　，謂本市煤灰燃料，過去因交通運輸發生困難，故外問感傳本市煤炭發生恐慌之虞，然實際並不如此，蓋本市煤炭，過去雖全賴外地烘給，但華北煤炭，仍源源不斷南運，火車班次雖行減少，但北煤南運數量，與過去相差不多，同時淮南煤礦亦鑒於華中燃料之亟需，已增添員工，積極增加出煤數量，源源運滬，以應需要。</p>
<h3>蘇滬定期客船　昨日開航</h3>
<p>查邇來火車班次减少，行旅頗受影響，此間工商界爲謀親助火車交通便利行旅，爰經商得上海內河輪船公司同意，成立生昌航運公司於北蘇州路九九八號，舉辦上海蘇州定期客船，規定當天，到蘇州，業於昨日開航。</p>
<h3>登記工商行號　將嚴格調查</h3>
<p>市經濟局日前公告工商登記於本月底截止，太市尚未登記各工商行號，前往登記者，極爲踴躍，該局爲求明瞭全市廠商生產情况，以謀抑平物價，對各工商登記行號，均予以嚴格調查，方發給證書，至於則曾在糧食局領有登記者，除資本相符，毋容登記外，其他巳增資商號，盼速到局辦理登記。</p>
<h3>市警察局　調整員警待遇　前二局員警提高薪津</h3>
<p>本市警察局自將前第一二兩警局合併後，對員　待遇調整問題，已一再考慮，經於本月份起，前第二局員警，暫照原來薪津增加二倍，而於十月一日起，前第二警局員警在總局及市區各分局服務者，一律提高薪津與前第一局之員警待遇相等，至於郊區各分局員警之待遇，於本月份起亦漸加二倍，　後當遂漸計劃調整。</p>
<p>嚴　查緝變相煙賭</p>
<p>市警察局司法處，秉承當局禁絕烟賭二毒之意旨，近對私烟私賭，予以嚴厲查緝，近查市區內變相之「俱樂部」，相繼設立，且十九爲住宅公館，裝璜富麗，糾集商賣巨富，甚且政府機關官員，以俱樂爲幌，而作變相之賭合，設有牌九，撲克等賭具，並發行籌磚，輸贏至鉅，更有設置烟榻，供客吸食雅片，如此行爲，非但有違烟賭禁規，日對市府公佈之規定用電時間，亦有抵觸，談處決予取締，已令飭防犯科嚴　偵查，並曾召若干俱樂部主，嚴加申斥，警告以後絕對不得再有類似　睹及供客吸食雅片情事發生，否則一經查實，當拘獲從嚴懲辦，同時對無執照之變相俱樂部，將一　予以取締查封。</p>
<p>積極强化督察工作　　本市警察局一二兩局，自八月一日後，幅員廣大，　境遼闊，督察處長郭紹儀，副處長二宮健吉二氏，不遣餘力，積極擴充內部組織，强化督察工作，內設事務科，視察科，調查科各科長，以督察長兼任，並設獎懲督察長室，各執其事，以謀推進事務，原有北五樓辦公室房屋，狹小不敷應用，爰於本月一月，遷至南五樓新址辦公。</p>
<h3>日用品登記　歸經濟局辦理</h3>
<p>本市日用品登記，原田前第一區公署經濟處辦理，自本市行政機構統一，是項工作劃歸經濟局第四科繼續辦理登記。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息　「銀海千秋」明日初映　各界熱心銷券盛情可感　助學義舉人人應盡義務</h3>
<p>「銀海千秋」部千載難逢，人生可遇不可求的鉅片，明天下午二時將在大光明初度獻映，而且是爲申新兩報助學金義演，是爲救濟淸寒學子而有此義舉，其意義的深長，不言而喻。此片不但有二十六位明星，唱四十三闋名歌，使人興奮，陶醉，痛快淋漓；最後還有一幕升旗典禮，是極莊嚴極偉大的塲面。當中華民國的靑天自天滿地紅國旗冉冉上升的時候，正是一片熱烈雄壯的歌聲，那團結一致的氣概，象徵着　運昌隆，日進於無　之域，使你看了，心裏發生無限的安慰與無窮的希望！</p>

<h3>最小票面紙幣的收回問題</h3>
<p>— 程起鵬</p>
<p>目從物價畸形的高漲以來，各種物品至少以一元為單位，於是，角票與分券已視之若贅疣。起初電車和水電公司尙作另找之用，其後電車漲價，水電公司竟拒收一元以下的紙幣，而銀行營業　因　數麻煩也拒收大量角分要存入的事情發生。至今，除了交付另售捐之外，可說一無教用。主　們却作爲給與小孩玩農和睹博時籌碼的資料了。於是，角分輔幣的卑視心理更形加震了。</p>
<p>七月份經濟日報的社評內也曾討論過這問題。它說，往昔在金點本位時代，銀行維持輔幣的辦法為無限制收入輔幣，並令。目從實行法幣政策以還，各種紙幣只有票面小大的區別，並無資格正輪的分類。故發行齣機關更應負起無限制兌入小粟面紙幣的責任，以堅人民的信仰和减少遭受的損失云。</p>
<p>眞的，小票面輔幣券的發行數額，也可說有一個很大的數字，若發行的機關並不依照上述所說實行，那末，人民遭受的損失豈不太過天了嗎？如果收圓大量小票，掉出極少的大票，在發行機關方面的損失可謂微乎其微，而在人民方面則集腋成裘衆沙成丘，固也不無小補。此外，發行輔幣機關的信用也由此可增，實為一舉數得之事，未悉負資財政當局意下如何？</p>
<h3>社會服務　金榮宗先生　捐款響應助產　盼社會同情更大努力</h3>
<p>金榮宗先生來函云：「鄙人上次捐助助產金，蒙賜二十三號收條，收到無悮，茲又附上支票一紙，計三千元，仍淸捐入貴處助產金項下為荷。鄙意賣處倡辦助產金一項，於社會公益，補助匪淺。但本巿人口衆多，生殖繁滋，尤以中下及　苦階級為最，但因困於經濟，多數都由舊法接生，或由稍具生產經騐之相熟婦女，草草了事，危險之大，不堪設想，因此每年罹難產，國產後染病，死於非命者，屈指難算。甚有母孩二命，同時偕亡，皆此不合衛生接生之所致，天下悽慘之事，　有逾於此者乎。故盼貴處，對於助產一事，作更大之努力，普遍推行，則本巿貧苦階級產婦幸甚，社會幸甚，鄙人區區微數，聊供拋磚引玉巳耳。」</p>
<h3>雷雨　海軍（一）</h3>
<p>— 田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>一九四〇年賞中，遠東危機說，至少風傳過三次。謠言雖然很盛，但結果總是不知不覺烟消雲散。然而第三次的　靈，自從一九四一年夏天以來，數益凝結，始綫不散。</p>
<p>一　人　迷惑於天氣的預測。直　遭受實兩前兆者，勿寗觀是地方上的人士。中央因有過多的氣象舉者，所以議論紛紜，莫衷一是。甚至有人觀，朝　是睛天的象徵。</p>
<p>到了十月，近衛第三次內閣總辭職，當東條內閣上台時，總覺得有豁然開期的感覺然而不久後，人們人數於五星　中，開始漠然不淸了。十一月一號香烟價大漲，或許不是不聲不響的ABCD聯合陣綫之逼迫，而是人心作崇所致。</p>
<p>十一月十四日，羅斯福在招待新聞記者席上曾聲明太平洋危機的重大，然而當時我們日本的來栖大使，坐飛機從中途島正飛至舊金山的上空。用不着解釋，外交官都是和平使者。大使和　村大使共同向來迎接的美國記者說，盡量設法轉緩。</p>
<p>過了不久，停止感謝節旅行的火總統羅斯福和赫爾，同野村來栖兩大使開始第一次談判了。談判繼續過兩三次後，雖然給一般人民一個困難震震的印像，但認為絕望者尙沒有。雖然如此，但十一月二十七日，上海的美國陸戰隊終於撤退了。謝於菲律賓的戰備加張了。英國也在緬甸增兵了，在馬來增加了許多印度兵，新嘉坡的東方海面上數上機　，十二月一日，以新銳戰艦威爾斯親王號爲旗艦的艦隊，在新嘉坡入港了。</p>
<p>「雷雨終於要來了。」</p>
<p>在戰雲密佈下傳來了這樣緊迫的聲音。</p>
<p>「但現在還不能下斷語吧！愈發困雜的外交交涉，或許反而有突然好轉的前途。　令談判決烈，也不至於立刻衝突。」</p>
<p>似乎懂得氣象學的人，發出這樣樂觀的聲音</p>
<p>十二月五日，日本帝國政府把回答交給了第入次日美談判會議上。</p>
<p>七日的報章上，突然登出交涉停頓的消息，但在這一天，羅斯福大總統頭佈美國海軍動員令</p>
<p>終於十二月八日的早晨降臨了。晨光微曦中的留雨，撼醒了日本全國人民。濛濛的烟霧，完全吹散無餘，怒髮冲冠的人們，都表現着初冬的殺氣。呵，誰都不會忘記那個風靜日暖的蒼空。（一三九）</p>

        <h1>1944.09.07</h1>
<h3>The Anguish of Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>The mentality of youth is progressive and full of emotion. With a progressive heart, there must be progressive goals and hopes; however, when encountering obstacles and setbacks on the road of progress, and failing to immediately achieve what is expected, one is easily moved by emotion and easily becomes distressed.</p>
<p>From the perspective of youth regarding the nation, youth are the most patriotic part of the citizenry. The nation they love is complete, whole, and unified. The textbooks they read in elementary school are about loving the motherland and the national state; the education and edification they receive in middle school are also about loving the motherland and the national state. Furthermore, they further understand the tragedy of national division; history teaches them how rare and difficult it is for the weak to become strong again, and for the perished to be revived. Therefore, they are even more unwilling to see history repeat itself in their most beloved motherland. As for university, there is no need to mention it; in various lectures and teaching materials on political science, economics, and history, they are given valuable lessons, gaining a deeper understanding of their own country. Their minds are innocent, their ideals are pure, their passion is precious, and they have only one goal: "There is only one motherland." However, while they have their national ideals, they also see the reality of the nation today. Ideals and reality cannot be reconciled into one, but instead form a huge contradiction. Contradiction is their obstacle and setback. Thus, the first and greatest anguish arises in their hearts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding youth and education, youth not only want to receive school education, but should also receive education above the basic level. They have aspirations and far-reaching desires, hoping to contribute to society and the country, and to serve humanity in the future. Precisely because of this, they are particularly interested in the education they should receive, and precisely because of this, they have even greater ambitions for their future. Their urgent desire for learning is a good sign for the future of the country. But what is the reality? The rising prices and increasing difficulty of life - do these help or destroy the desire of young people to study? The increasing hardship of teachers and the increasing difficulty of obtaining books - do these help or destroy the desire of young people to study? All of these things run counter to the ideals of young people to study, and are contradictions between ideals and reality. Contradiction is their obstacle and setback. Thus, the second and greatest anguish arises in their hearts.</p>
<p>The anguish of youth is by no means limited to this. These are only the greatest of their anguishes. If the anguish of youth is not resolved for a day, the strength of youth will not be guided and developed for a day. Therefore, the government has the responsibility to find ways to relieve the anguish of countless youth across the country. In particular, those who lead youth movements in the government need to pay attention to self-reflection.</p>
<p>However, a distressing environment and a distressed spirit are two different things. The current environment is indeed distressing; however, the spirit of youth should still be uplifted. They should never be dominated by the environment. According to the opinions of the education sector, the entrance examination results of various universities this semester are worse than in the past, which is clear evidence that the spirit of youth cannot be uplifted. Therefore, on the government's side, there is of course a practical responsibility to relieve the anguish of youth, while on the youth's side, they should also uplift their spirits, create a new environment, and not be dominated by the environment.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The 85th Extraordinary Session was held on the 6th.

After the House of Peers held the opening ceremony, it began a plenary session at 1:30 pm, resolving to reply to the Imperial Rescript.

Then, Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech on general administrative policies, and the Army and Navy ministers reported on the war situation, and proposed a resolution of gratitude and condolences to the Army and Navy.

The Army and Navy ministers expressed their gratitude separately. Due to time constraints, the questions about the speeches of the Ministers of State were changed to be held on the 7th, and then the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The selection of the standing committees of the Japanese House of Representatives and the decision of the drafting committee were carried out by the staff of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association's Diet Affairs Bureau. In the Diet Affairs Bureau meeting on the 6th, the candidates for each committee and the candidates for each committee chairman have been selected as follows: Drafting Committee Chairman for the Imperial Rescript Reply, Kawakami Tetsuta; Chairman of the Whole House Committee, Shiba Yasushinkuro; Chairman of the Budget Committee, Katsuta Eikichi; Chairman of the Settlement Committee, Miura Torao; Chairman of the Proposal Committee, Miyazawa Hiroshi; Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Ichinomiya Fusajiro.</p>
<p>Contents of Various Japanese Budget Proposals</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's proposed temporary military expenditure special accounting budget and other budget proposals for the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet have been finalized after negotiations by various ministries, and were discussed at the regular cabinet meeting on the 5th. After Finance Minister Ishiwata gave a detailed explanation, it was decided to present them to the Emperor in the afternoon, and the Information Bureau released the contents at 5:00 pm. The contents are recorded as follows: Supplementary proposal for the special account budget for temporary military expenditure; Supplementary proposal for the total budget for revenue and expenditure for Showa 19 (Republic of China 22); Contractual matters for which the national treasury bears the burden other than the special account budget for public bonds and coal supply and demand adjustment, of which the additional amount of temporary military expenditure for direct warfare is 25 billion yen. The cumulative total of the additional amount of this item's accounting for Showa 19, together with the amount decided by the 84th Diet, totals a huge amount of 63 billion yen, which is a sharp increase of 36 billion yen compared with the additional amount in Showa 18. The wartime financial system is now complete. At the same time, it was also decided to add a supplementary budget for general accounting related to the Ministry of Finance's expenses, including the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce's food, coal, and firewood production increase, and temporary Diet expenses. The total amount of revenue and expenditure is 385,444,000 yen. Therefore, the total budget for general accounting this year, including this additional amount, actually reaches 20.558 million yen. Secondly, the public bond special accounting supplementary budget proposal is about 5.2 billion yen, and it was decided to issue new price bonds to cover this temporary military expenditure supplementary budget. In addition, the contractual expenditure that the national treasury bears the burden of outside the budget is estimated to be 639 million yen, including 500 million yen for food, coal, and firewood production increase and the next year's arable land improvement expenses. Including the temporary military expenditure, general accounting, and the supplementary budgets for various special accounts, and the one passed by the 84th Diet, the total amount is 83.558 million yen. After deducting the duplicate expenses of 7.25 million yen, it is counted as 76.352 million yen, which is an actual increase of 39.2 billion yen compared with the 37.09 million yen in Showa 18. Temporary Military Expenditure Decided to Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The additional budget proposal for temporary military expenditure to be submitted to the Japanese Extraordinary Session of the Diet is counted as 25 billion yen, of which 20 billion yen is for regular expenses and 5 billion yen is for reserve funds. This money is borrowed from the Southern Development Bank and collected from miscellaneous income from public bonds. The contents are divided as follows (in millions of yen): Southern Development Bank loan (19,200), public bonds (5,197), miscellaneous income (1,602). The 28.2 billion yen borrowed from the Development Bank has reached 70% of the temporary military supplementary budget. This budget is based on the increase in war expenses on the continent and in the south. The cumulative Southern Development Bank loan this year is 25.2 billion yen, and the burden on the residents of the south to complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly heavy. Since the China Incident, the cumulative temporary military expenditure budget to date is 137.128 million yen.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government submitted this year's general special budget supplementary proposal the day before the 85th Extraordinary Session of the Diet was held, and announced that the additional amount of the temporary military budget was 25 billion yen. Together with the 38 billion yen of the temporary military supplementary budget decided by the previous cabinet, the total amount has reached a huge amount of 63 billion yen, plus this year's general special expense accounting amount, totaling 76.33 million. More than half of this amount has been decided to be issued in eight bonds. According to this temporary military expenditure supplementary budget proposal, compared with the 220 million yen during the first Sino-Japanese War and the 3.34 billion yen during the Russo-Japanese War, this is much larger than the 2.02 billion yen in the first year of the Sino-Japanese Incident. From this, it can be seen that the huge amount of this budget is worthy of attention. More than 70% of it is loans from the Southern Development Bank and the co-prosperity sphere, and more than 20% is public funds.</p>
<h3>Important Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso Scheduled to be Delivered in the Diet Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The speech to be delivered by Japanese Prime Minister Koiso on the 7th is his first policy speech since the establishment of the new cabinet, and is extremely important.

The first half of the speech will focus on the major outline of domestic policies, and the second half will detail the cooperation issues with various countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, expressing the Japanese government's enthusiasm for promoting the Empire's consistent policy in the decisive battle phase, and particularly declaring that the Japanese government, according to this policy, will take active and constructive actions in certain regions of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Third Food Production Increase Budget Amount</h3>

<h3>Japanese Technology Institute to be Reorganized into Planning Agency</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to review science and technology, scientific warfare, and production policies, resolved on the 29th of August to implement a plan for the militarization of science and technology during the cabinet meeting. It is now learned that the contents of this measure were officially announced on the 5th by the Technology Institute of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Education. This measure is entirely for the purpose of strongly developing scientific and technological research, with the aim of making it the general staff headquarters for science and technology. Under the close cooperation of the military, government, and civilians, a "Land and Sea Military Technology Operation Committee" will be established. This committee will be composed of representatives from related departments belonging to the Land and Sea Military, as well as powerful figures in the science and technology community of the Technology Institute of the Ministry of Munitions and the Ministry of Education. It will be responsible for researching and deciding on the highest policies for science and technology, scientific warfare, and scientific production. As an organization for scientific and technological personnel, the existing academic research association will be reorganized and expanded. The mobilization of powerful scientific researchers and scientific and technological personnel across the country has been prepared. Following the implementation of the above policies, the reorganization of the Technology Institute into a Technical Planning Agency is also being considered. The Manchurian Concordia Association's All-Liaison Council Closes</p>

<h3>A Glimpse of the Two Experimental County Areas of Dangtu and Jiangning Min Xian</h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government selected five counties - Jiangning, Kunshan, Jiaxing, Dangtu, and Nanhui - as experimental county areas. This reporter, on this trip to Wuhu, made a special stay in Dangtu and Jiangning counties for several days. "Both counties are on the Nanjing-Wuhu Line." The history and area of the two counties will not be repeated. Only the sights and sounds are recorded as follows: Scenery of Dangtu</p>
<p>As soon as this reporter exited the Dangtu train station, he had a good impression. The roads were quite clean, and the trees along the road were quite neat. The mountains and rivers were interspersed near the road, and the scenery was pleasant. The armed comrades who checked the travelers on the road were also quite polite. There were many rice shops in the city streets, most of which were attached to a money shop. This area is a rice-producing area, and the money shop is attached to facilitate the large-scale purchase of rice. Immediately afterwards, I went to the nearby rural areas of Cihu, Caishi, Ma'anshan, etc. along the Nanjing-Wuhu Line to pay my respects, and I was able to talk with the farmers cordially. I learned that the harvests in the county have been good in recent years. Each mu of dry land yields about three to four dan, and each mu of paddy field yields about four to five dan. The lives are comfortable. The people in the cities and villages of the county also have a characteristic, that is, most of them are at ease and trust the authorities. Originally, the security in the county has been quite good since the incident. Although bandits have not completely disappeared, because all towns and villages in the county are equipped with a telephone network, as soon as there is a bandit alarm in any place, the security team will rush to eliminate them at any time. It is said that this security team is quite well-equipped, with about two hundred people, and several trucks and several speedboats. Land and water marches are very convenient. As a result, the bandits have disappeared and mostly go to neighboring counties. It is said that this equipment was created by the current Zhang, the chief of the county police bureau, who also manages the county's affairs. "Mr. Zhang has been in the county for a long time, and has been commended by the National Government and awarded a bonus of 200,000 yuan." The funds are derived from the so-called security surcharge added to the land tax. "The county has a total of 630,000 mu of farmland." The people have no complaints because they are able to live in peace. It can be seen that what is taken from the people and used for the people will surely be praised by the people. However, the education situation is very low. The county is now in the process of establishing a junior high school. Other cultural undertakings such as public education halls and gymnasiums have not been given attention, and are only for show. Because the people's lives are relatively comfortable, the gambling atmosphere is very strong. The amount of winnings or losses often amounts to tens of thousands of gold, which would make urbanites gasp. The authorities have done a good job in handling the word "security", but they seem unable to take care of the word "education". It is hoped that when the experimental county administration is implemented in the future, the three words "education, cultivation, and health" will advance at the same time. A Glimpse of Jiangning</p>
<p>Leaving the county of Dangtu, still along the Nanjing-Suzhou Line to Jiangning Town in Jiangning County, the town has about a hundred households. When the reporter arrived in the town at 7:00 pm, he immediately discovered that the people were uneasy. Originally, the bandits and communists in Loulan Town (also under the jurisdiction of Jiangning County) nearby were rampant, and they had been alarmed several times a night for several days. When talking with the people, most of their beliefs were shaken, which was caused by the environment. The reporter then turned to Nanjing along the Nanjing-Wuhu Highway and arrived at Jiangning County. On the surface, there was no sign of restlessness, but when talking with the people, most of them asked where you came from and how that village was. In short, if security is not guaranteed, it is difficult to correct the ideology. Jiangning's congenital nature is much worse than that of Dangtu. In the future, when the authorities implement the experimental county administration, it will inevitably take more effort. It is hoped that the authorities will implement rural construction, and take the experimental county area as a unit, or there may be other ways to remedy it.</p>

<h3>Developments in the Balkan Situation: Soviet Union Declares War on Bulgaria with Prior Consent from Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency urgent cable) - Haitong News Agency quoted a Moscow wireless report as saying that the Soviet Union has declared war on Bulgaria. The Soviet Union has delivered a declaration of war to Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, Mr. Shivimenov, stating briefly that Bulgaria has assisted Germany in fighting against the Soviet Union for three years, and is now providing Germany with a base to establish a resistance front. Therefore, the Soviet government has no choice but to declare war on Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Minister immediately reported the content of the declaration to his government. As of 5:00 PM yesterday (Moscow time), the two countries were at war.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov announced at a press conference on the evening of the 5th that before handing over the declaration of war to the Bulgarian Minister to the Soviet Union, he had informed the British and American Ambassadors to the Soviet Union of his intentions.</p>
<h3>Background to the Declaration of War</h3>
<p>Bern, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: Information obtained from sources close to the Greek Embassy reveals the following regarding the Soviet Union's declaration of war on Bulgaria: The Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria just as Britain and the United States were about to conclude armistice negotiations with Bulgaria. The difficulty in the negotiations was that the former Bulgarian government was unwilling to return Dede Agach and Kayalla, which provide access to the Aegean Sea, to Greece. Britain had promised Greece in Cairo eighteen months ago to restore these two places, and therefore insisted that Bulgaria return these two places. The new and old governments of Bulgaria held different views on this, and the Soviet Union believed that if Bulgaria made concessions to Britain and the United States, it would be equivalent to not allowing the Soviet Union to gain an exit to the Aegean Sea through Bulgaria. Therefore, the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria in order to invade Bulgaria as soon as possible and obtain an exit to the Aegean Sea.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Seeks Peace</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: According to London Broadcasting, the Bulgarian government has requested the Soviet Embassy in Bulgaria to forward a request for a ceasefire to the Soviet government.

<h3>German Commentary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Foreign Office stated on the evening of the 5th regarding the details of the Soviet declaration of war on Bulgaria: The Bulgarian Prime Minister has repeatedly advocated the principles of democracy and the strength of Britain and the United States. Although the Bulgarian government has repeatedly clarified its kinship with the Soviet government, the Soviet government's measure clearly demonstrates the true meaning of their kinship.</p>
<h3>Changes Re-emerge in Soviet-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>Bern, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: According to reports in newspapers here, recent developments in Romania and the Balkan Peninsula have made Turkey feel uneasy. The reason is that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Turkey has changed. After a brief period of improvement, relations between the two countries seem to have become ambiguous again, and negotiations on a new Soviet-Turkish treaty have been suspended.</p>

The tank convoys of the British Second Army, after passing through Brussels, have now reached the Antwerp area and the Scheldt River. Other enemy forces are advancing towards the northwest and west, pressing the German army in the obstacle positions built on the middle and upper reaches of the Scheldt River and the Lys River. Canadian forces are attacking the German obstacle positions on the Canche River, and fierce fighting is taking place. The enemy forces have made no progress in any of these sectors. The left wing of the U.S. First Army is advancing north between the Sambre and Meuse Rivers. Due to strong German resistance, it has also been unable to achieve its objective. The anti-Axis forces have recently increased pressure on the area between the Meuse and Moselle Rivers. U.S. tank forces are attempting to break into the Lorraine basin and are currently encountering strong German counterattacks. Metz and Nancy were still in German hands the night before last.</p>
<h3>German Strategy to Defend the Homeland</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities stated on the 5th regarding the situation on the Western Front as follows: The German army on the Western Front has reached a critical juncture.

As for the transfer of German troops from France, it should be done as circumstances dictate by the German command. The issue of buying time is a prerequisite for achieving the third task.

<h3>Returning from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>I left the Russian capital on July 12, just a few days after the third anniversary of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war. At that time, the Moscow citizens were most concerned with, and what became the center of conversation, was, "The war seems to be nearing its end..." Why did the Soviet citizens think the war was nearing its end? It was because the so-called Second Front had been opened. As a Russian proverb says, "Even with promises, one must wait three years." In reality, the Soviet people had been waiting for the fulfillment of the promise of a Second Front from the British and American Allies for three years.</p>
<p>The reason why the Soviet army had to continue to fight bitterly with the German army was also because the British and Americans did not fulfill their promise of a Second Front. The Soviet leaders had to painstakingly explain to the people. Therefore, upon hearing the news that the British and American forces had begun landing in northern France, they simply thought that the war was nearing its end. This was not accidental or unreasonable.</p>
<p>The Soviet people were so eager for the realization of the Second Front. An old woman I knew well told me with a joyful expression: "I was summoned yesterday, and I will be returning from the team tomorrow, because the Second Front has already been opened today."</p>
<p>The Soviet people have indeed endured hardship and bitterness in the past three years of bitter fighting. The desire to end the war as soon as possible permeates all levels of the nation, but it would be too much to think that their anger towards the enemy and their burning desire for revenge have diminished. The government whipped the exhausted bodies and minds of the people by scratching the place where the people's anger and desire for revenge were. These are all true situations.</p>
<h3>15 Million Dead and Wounded</h3>
<p>Although the German attacks were fierce, the Soviet defense was indeed good. How did the vast battlefield of the Eastern Front become a large-scale slaughterhouse? In the past three years, the total number of dead and wounded on both sides has averaged more than 15,000 people per day, totaling about 15 million people. In that vast battlefield area of European Russia, one can dig up the bodies of enemies and friends buried everywhere. As for the cities that have become fire lanes, they have almost become uninhabited ruins, and it is extremely difficult to identify the streets of the past. About 60 kilometers outside Moscow, the town of Istora was a beautiful rural town with hundreds of tiled houses before the war. However, when I returned to Moscow from Kuibyshev and revisited the old place, because the area became the target of guns and artillery fired by both sides during the Moscow defense battle in the winter of 1941, there are now no intact houses. The roofs have flown away, the walls have collapsed, and only the skeletons of the buildings remain, blackened by cannon smoke, like tombstones standing everywhere in the ruins. Stalingrad was a newly developed industrial city on the banks of the Volga River, but a certain Russian who inspected the city's misery told me, "There are only twenty-six houses in the entire city that have escaped the destruction of the war and remain intact."</p>
<h3>Women Aviation Soldiers and Tank Soldiers</h3>
<p>The hills where fierce battles took place have changed color due to the indiscriminate bombardment of bombs and shells from both sides. The fierceness and misery of the situation are beyond description. The Soviet people, with men on the front lines and women in the rear, have been engaged in this fierce war for three years. The mobilization of men is most intense in the countryside. What remains in the home are either children under the age of thirteen or fourteen, or old people in their sixties or seventies. There are also female village chiefs and female household heads. Young women with headscarves, driving trucks with the dashing posture of rubber soldiers, can be seen in every village and town.</p>
<p>In the cities, only government offices and important military factories still have a considerable number of men of conscription age working. For example, almost all streetcar drivers are women around the age of twenty or thirty. Some people have seen them driving large locomotives that can pull five or six-ton trucks--forty or fifty cars. There are also many women engaged in heavy work such as coal miners, lathe workers, and earthworkers. Soviet women not only guard the rear, but also stand side by side with men on the front lines in the hail of bullets as aviation soldiers, tank soldiers, snipers, anti-aircraft gun teams, military doctors, and nurses. Although the exact number is unknown, experts estimate that it reaches more than one million people.</p>
<p>If it were not for the dedicated efforts and activities of Soviet women, which are no less than those of men, I am afraid that it would not be possible to prevent this war! (Author: Masaharu Hatanaka, Moscow Bureau Chief of Asahi Shimbun) (Xiang: Translated from Asahi Shimbun, August 18)</p>

<h3>Ninth Air Defense Day: Air Defense Training Procedures with Special Emphasis on Civilian Shelter Training</h3>
<p>In view of the current tense air defense situation, the city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters will soon usher in the Ninth Air Defense Day and further train citizens to pay attention to shelter training so that they can protect their lives during air raids. The following training plan for the Air Defense Day on September 9 has been formulated:</p>
<p>Training Alert Times (A) Training alert issuance and cancellation times: First training - Alert issuance at 9:30 AM, Air raid alert issuance at 10:30 AM, Air raid alert cancellation at 11:00 AM, Alert cancellation at 12:00 noon. Second training - Air raid alert issuance at 3:20 PM, Air raid alert cancellation at 12:00 noon. Alert cancellation at 10:00 PM. The above times will be announced in the newspaper and broadcast on the radio to inform citizens. Sirens will not be sounded temporarily. (B) During the alert issuance training, only air defense residual lights (i.e., air defense lights among streetlights) will be turned on. Lights will be turned off during the air raid alert.</p>
<p>Shelter Training Items (C) Training items: 1. Home shelter training, 2. Shelter training for those outdoors (including pedestrians), 3. Shelter training for large stores, banks, companies, hotels, teahouses, etc., 4. Shelter training for amusement parks, theaters, etc., 5. Shelter training for trains, ships, docks, factories, workplaces, etc., 6. Shelter training in parks, schools, sports fields, competition fields, etc. (D) Shelter essentials: Implement the previously instructed methods comprehensively according to the stated objectives. Shelter outlines are currently being drafted as a basis for guidance, but they will not be promulgated for this training.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Real Alerts</p>
<p>(E) Others: 1. During this training, if sirens are heard, it should be known that it is not a training alert but a real alert, and measures should be taken quickly to respond. 2. Saturday, September 9, is the 22nd day of the seventh lunar month. Moonrise is at 11:52 PM on September 9, and moonset is at 3:12 PM on September 10. 3. Baojia and self-defense corps members, as well as the general public, should be encouraged to wear air defense clothing so that they can lie down and take shelter anytime, anywhere without hindrance. 4. The brightness of flashlights should be below one candlepower, and fabrics of different colors should be used to cover the light-emitting part so that the light is emitted directly and cannot be identified at any point more than 300 meters away. Under no circumstances should it be shone upwards at an angle of more than 15 degrees to the ground. The colors of the light-shielding fabrics for flashlights are differentiated as follows: 1. Red for military flashlights, 2. Yellow or orange for official (including police officer) flashlights, 3. Blue or green for civilian flashlights (including Baojia groups and self-defense corps). However, police, fire, and rescue personnel are allowed to use flashlights within the necessary minimum range in case of emergency during their duties. 5. Traffic control during the issuance of alerts must be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>Shelter Start Time: The shelter start time will be determined according to the assumed situation planned by each police precinct. In addition, guidance will be provided to regard Japanese training planes flying overhead at the scheduled time as enemy planes and to take shelter immediately upon seeing the plane's shadow or hearing the sound. The scheduled time for training flights is from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The locations for setting up shelters are as follows: 1. Each household should be ordered to select a strong and safe place as a shelter. 2. Each bao should be ordered to set up one or more public shelters for public use and should be encouraged to set up appropriate public shelters as soon as possible. 3. As for outdoor shelter, during the training, the public should be guided to quickly use the terrain and objects for self-help and to disperse and lie down to take shelter. 4. Large stores, banks, companies, hotels, teahouses, amusement parks, theaters, bookstores, cinemas, trains, ships, docks, factories, workplaces, and similar places should be ordered to set up appropriate shelters. 5. Special self-defense corps for various businesses or special buildings, as well as each bao area, should be ordered to set up one or more anti-air and anti-ground observation posts during the issuance of alerts. The establishment and operation of observation posts are very important, and the guiding principles for them are currently being considered. 6. Upon seeing an enemy plane or hearing the sound of a plane, the observation post should immediately use a megaphone to shout "Airplane coming!" (It is best to unify the terminology) and strike a steel gong to immediately implement shelter on all sides.</p>
<h3>Measures for Entertainment Venues</h3>
<p>The city's Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to arouse a correct understanding of air defense among entertainment venue operators and the general public and to prepare for all eventualities, convened the first dust talk meeting on air defense measures at the headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month, gathering representatives of operators of racetracks, jai alai courts, dog racing tracks, etc. On the afternoon of the 5th, the second symposium was held, gathering representatives of operators of dance halls, amusement parks, etc. Yesterday (the 6th), starting at 2:00 PM, the last symposium was held, gathering representatives of operators of theaters, cinemas, opera houses, Shanghai opera, Shaoxing opera, and other theaters. It is reported that the headquarters authorities instructed the representatives of various entertainment venue operators on various points of air defense in great detail, so that once alerts and air raids are issued, the entertainment venue operating authorities can clearly understand the necessary measures to take, such as posting alert signs in the venue to inform the entertainers of how to take shelter and take measures. The symposium was very successful.</p>
<h3>Materials Distribution Office Formulates Special Rice Distribution Measures for Teachers and Staff; Public and Private Schools Treated Equally</h3>
<p>In accordance with the Mayor's intentions, the city's Materials Distribution Office is now handling a special allocation of rice to teachers and staff to help alleviate the insufficiency of their livelihoods. Regulations have been formulated and submitted to the city government for implementation. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3>No Applications if Rice is Used as Tuition</h3>
<p>The purpose of the special rice allocation for teachers and staff is to alleviate the financial difficulties of teachers and staff in various schools, which directly and indirectly helps promote the development of education in this city. Therefore, teachers and staff of all levels of schools within the city, whether municipal, public, or private schools recognized by the Ministry of Education or the Municipal Bureau of Education, may apply to the office for allocation in accordance with the regulations. However, schools that have already actually collected rice from students as tuition fees may not apply.</p>
<h3>Monthly Rice Allocation of 3.5 Sheng Per Person</h3>
<p>Teachers and staff of various schools applying to the city's Materials Distribution Office for a special allocation of rice must first obtain an application form from the Materials Distribution Office, fill in the number of teachers and staff, as well as the name, age, gender, and address of each person, and the residence permit number according to the regulations, and submit it to the Materials Distribution Office for review and approval. After approval, an A-type coupon will be issued in accordance with the special rice allocation regulations for civil servants. Each person can purchase 4.5 he of rice per period, with three periods per month, totaling 3.5 sheng.</p>
<h3>Part-Time Teachers Limited to Claiming at One School</h3>
<p>Teachers and staff who hold positions in more than one school are only allowed to apply in one school. If they leave the school, the principal of the school should immediately report it to the office and return any unused allocation certificates of the departing teachers and staff to the office. It is strictly forbidden to take advantage of the situation and fraudulently claim more. If any deliberate deception is discovered, the school's special rice allocation rights will be suspended, and the practice will be stopped.</p>
<h3>The Educational Characteristics of the Former Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Schools</h3>
<p>— Ueno Taichu</p>
<p>Manual Arts Curriculum</p>
<p>Secondary schools have always attached great importance to manual arts courses. N聶中丞 Public School aims to develop manual arts education as one of its goals. The school has a well-equipped workshop where many students satisfy their urge for activity and develop a practical spirit every day. However, manual arts are different from labor. The former is at least biased towards individual, passive muscle activity, while the latter emphasizes collective, automatic hand-brain coordination. Therefore, elementary schools go a step further, seeking to link labor with other subjects. In self-supplementary materials and weaving subjects, there is a trend from "listening" in class to "doing" by hand. Of course, most of the teaching materials are self-compiled, such as the natural science materials published by the World Book Company…social teaching materials…and the intermediate common sense textbooks published by Chunqiu Book Company, which can all be linked to labor education.</p>
<p>Music and Art Education Secondary schools, whether junior or senior, mostly neglect subjects such as aesthetics and the expression of thoughts and feelings, and creative art and music. Even a simple school song is rarely heard. There are also few student art creations displayed in the school. Most of the school's time is spent injecting knowledge into the students' heads, and it is extremely difficult to reach the students' emotions. However, the seven elementary schools, under the leadership of the Chinese Education Department, pay special attention to this type of curriculum. They have hired experts to study and compile a music collection with three levels, low, medium, and high, suitable for each grade level. It is popular throughout the city and is still in use today. The development of the art subject, from static drawing, sculpture, model building, and other works, has progressed to live drama design. For example, the puppet shows popular in Shanghai today originated from the design and creation of the Chinese Education Department's activities. To this day, the heads of the puppet troupes are still staff members of the former Education Department.</p>
<p>Physical Education Curriculum</p>
<p>The British have always been known for their emphasis on physical education, believing that good citizens should be cultivated on the sports field. Therefore, they did not bring the whole spirit to Lian Tong Middle School. For decades, there has been no significant emphasis on physical education. There are also very few activities related to physical education. Although there are many domestic physical education pioneers teaching at Chinese Public Schools, their main job is not teaching physical education. Most of their time is spent teaching English or other subjects. After class, students are not allowed to stay in the classroom and must all go to the playground. But what do they do on the playground? Just take a walk and chat, with few collective sports. As for the uniforms that all students are required to wear, they consist of a long-billed hat and a long cloth gown. It is a bit cumbersome and inconvenient to walk in. Wearing this long uniform to the sports field, one can imagine the Englishman's intentions for the physical education of the state students. The elementary school physical education curriculum focuses on exercising children's physique and cultivating good virtues from the aspects of living habits. Sports skills are secondary. There are more collective activities than in middle schools. Scout training was also popular for a time. After the incident, due to the limitations of the school's sports field, physical education activities were mostly unheard of. It is a case of heroes having no place to use their skills.</p>
<h3>Coal Produced in Huainan is Transported to Shanghai Continuously</h3>
<p>According to news released by the relevant authorities, the city's coal ash fuel has had transportation difficulties in the past, so outsiders may feel that there is a coal panic in the city, but this is not the case. Although the city's coal has relied entirely on supplies from outside in the past, coal from North China is still being transported south continuously. Although the number of train trips has been reduced, the amount of coal transported south from the north is about the same as in the past. At the same time, the Huainan coal mine, in view of the urgent need for fuel in Central China, has added employees and actively increased coal production, which is being continuously transported to Shanghai to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Passenger Ship Between Suzhou and Shanghai Begins Sailing Yesterday</h3>
<p>In view of the recent reduction in the number of train trips, travelers have been greatly affected. In order to facilitate train transportation and benefit travelers, the business community here, after consultation with the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Company, agreed to establish the Shengchang Shipping Company at 998 North Suzhou Road, to operate scheduled passenger ships between Shanghai and Suzhou. It is stipulated that they will arrive in Suzhou on the same day, and the service began yesterday.</p>
<h3>Registration of Industrial and Commercial Firms Will Be Strictly Investigated</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau announced a few days ago that the deadline for industrial and commercial registration is at the end of this month. Various industrial and commercial firms in the city that have not yet registered are enthusiastically registering. In order to understand the production situation of manufacturers throughout the city, and to curb commodity prices, the Bureau will conduct strict investigations on the registration of various industrial and commercial firms before issuing certificates. As for those who have previously registered with the Grain Bureau, except for those with corresponding capital, there is no need to register. Other firms that have increased their capital should quickly go to the Bureau to register.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Bureau Adjusts Police Officer Salaries Salaries of Officers in the Former First and Second Bureaus are Increased</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has repeatedly considered the issue of adjusting the salaries of police officers since merging the former First and Second Police Bureaus. Starting this month, the police officers of the former Second Bureau will temporarily receive double their original salaries. Starting October 1, the salaries of police officers of the former Second Police Bureau serving in the General Bureau and various district sub-bureaus will be increased to be equal to the salaries of police officers of the former First Bureau. As for the salaries of police officers in various suburban sub-bureaus, they will also be gradually doubled starting this month, and adjustments will be gradually planned later.</p>
<p>Strictly Investigate Disguised Gambling and Opium Dens</p>
<p>The Judicial Office of the Municipal Police Bureau, adhering to the authorities' intention to eliminate the two evils of opium and gambling, has recently conducted strict investigations and crackdowns on private opium and private gambling. Recently, it has been found that disguised "clubs" have been established in the urban area one after another, and nineteen of them are residential mansions, luxuriously decorated, gathering wealthy merchants and even government officials, using clubs as a cover for disguised gambling, setting up mahjong, poker, and other gambling tools, and issuing chips, with huge wins and losses. Some even set up opium couches for guests to smoke opium. Such behavior not only violates the ban on opium and gambling, but also violates the regulations on electricity use announced by the Municipal Government. The office has decided to ban them and has ordered the prevention department to conduct strict investigations. It has also summoned several club owners, severely reprimanded them, and warned them that similar gambling and opium smoking should never occur again in the future. Otherwise, once verified, they will be arrested and severely punished. At the same time, disguised clubs without licenses will be banned and sealed up.</p>
<p>Actively Strengthen Supervision Work Since August 1, the area covered by the Municipal Police Bureau's First and Second Bureaus has been vast, and the territory is vast. The Director of Supervision, Guo Shaoyi, and the Deputy Director, Kenkichi Ninomiya, are sparing no effort to actively expand the internal organization and strengthen the supervision work. The office has established an Administrative Section, an Inspection Section, and an Investigation Section. The Director of each section is concurrently held by the Director of Supervision, and an Award and Punishment Supervision Office is established. Each performs its duties to promote affairs. The original office building on the fifth floor of the North Building is small and insufficient for use, so it was moved to the new address on the fifth floor of the South Building on January of this month.</p>
<h3>Registration of Daily Necessities is Handled by the Economic Bureau</h3>
<p>The registration of daily necessities in the city was originally handled by the Economic Office of the Former First District Office. Since the unification of the city's administrative agencies, this task has been assigned to the Fourth Section of the Economic Bureau for continued registration.</p>

It is also a charity performance for the Xin Shen Two Newspaper Scholarship Fund. It is a charitable act to help poor students, and its significance is self-evident.

<p>The Xin Shen Two Newspapers yesterday sent letters to various industrial and commercial sectors to promote the sale of movie tickets, divided into three types: 3,000 yuan, 1,500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. People from all walks of life readily accepted, generously promised to promote sales, and even sent funds in lieu of tickets that day. Such enthusiasm is deeply appreciated!

<p>Wu Mother Scholarship Fund</p>
<p>Wu Renjia and Zhongren brothers, in memory of their late mother Madam Chen, wrote to this newspaper to handle a special scholarship fund. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, August 21st is the 20th anniversary of our late mother's death. We received generous gifts from relatives and friends, and we are deeply ashamed. We think that the scholarship funds handled by your newspaper in the past have greatly benefited poor students. Therefore, we will use the gift money received, totaling 141,000 yuan in national currency, and the discounted value of silk tents, funerary objects, etc., totaling 19,000 yuan, to make a total of 160,000 yuan. Except for 10,000 yuan donated to the China Relief Fund for Women and Children by Mr. Xu Lifu, the giver, the remaining 150,000 yuan will be established as the 'Wu Mother Madam Chen Scholarship Fund.' The above scholarship fund has been deposited into the Lisheng Trust Bank at 398 Jiangxi Road, and account number 6009 has been opened for disaster relief, and the Trust Department of the bank is responsible for safekeeping. We have also consulted with the bank's authorities that since the matter is a charitable act, they have agreed to a special preferential interest rate of 40% per month. We have heard that the bank will soon jointly hold trust investment with other banks and firms. At that time, the scholarship fund will be entrusted as the investment amount, in order to obtain generous benefits and increase the number of scholarships. We plan to have your newspaper select the five best female students from poor families in the first year of junior high school and the first year of high school in each application for scholarships, and provide full funding for tuition and miscellaneous fees. The above scholarship quota is completely based on excellent academic performance and poor family background as the standard. We know that small streams cannot fill a large river, but we are just doing good for our relatives and friends."</p>
<p>Scholarship funds received yesterday: Song Zhuozai (commissioned to handle special scholarship funds) 29,500 yuan, Lu Wanyao 3,000 yuan, Xinxingji 700 yuan, Lin Jun 200 yuan, Ying Yongyu (sent on behalf of Mr. Pan Xianrong's late father) 40 yuan, Pu Qiting 20 yuan, totaling 33,460 yuan in storage coupons, leaving a balance of 16,280,340 yuan.</p>

In addition to the Director of the Bureau, Xu Tianshen, attending in person, relevant authorities will also send personnel to attend.</p>

<p>In order to adjust the salaries of civil servants, police, and security personnel, improve administrative efficiency, and establish a clean government, it is necessary to focus on promoting municipal affairs. Adjusting salaries requires funding, and the source of funding is nothing more than reorganizing miscellaneous taxes and increasing new taxes. However, how to reorganize and how to increase taxes, so as to meet the needs while taking into account the burden on citizens, is worthy of review and research. In order to gather ideas and expand benefits, the following article is published on the above topic, and the rules are as follows:</p>
<p>The title is self-determined, and the subject matter focuses on tax reorganization and tax increases, targeting the current situation and making practical suggestions, without advocating general principles.</p>
<p>The number of words is not limited, and the style of writing is not limited, with fluency and expressiveness as the main criteria.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Withdrawing the Smallest Denomination Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Cheng Qipeng</p>
<p>Since the abnormal rise in prices, various items have been priced at least in units of one yuan. Therefore, jiao and fen notes have been regarded as superfluous. Initially, trams and power companies still used them for making change, but later, tram fares rose, and power companies refused to accept banknotes below one yuan. Bank businesses also refused to accept large amounts of jiao and fen for deposit due to the hassle. Today, apart from paying retail donations, they are virtually useless. Householders are using them as materials for giving children toys and as gambling chips. Therefore, the contempt for jiao and fen subsidiary coins has become even more pronounced.</p>
<p>The editorial in the July Economic Daily also discussed this issue. It said that in the past, during the gold standard era, the bank maintained subsidiary coins by unlimited income of subsidiary coins. Since the implementation of the legal currency policy, various banknotes have only had differences in denomination size, and there is no classification of official coins. Therefore, the issuing authorities should bear the responsibility of unlimited redemption of small denomination banknotes, in order to strengthen the people's faith and reduce the losses suffered.</p>
<p>Indeed, the number of small denomination subsidiary coin notes issued can also be said to be a very large number. If the issuing authorities do not implement the above-mentioned measures, wouldn't the losses suffered by the people be too great? If a large number of small notes are withdrawn, and very few large notes are issued, the losses on the issuing authorities' side can be said to be minimal, while on the people's side, accumulating little by little can still make a small difference. In addition, the credit of the subsidiary coin issuing authority can also be increased, which is a multiple win. I wonder what the financial authorities think about it?</p>
<h3>Social Service Mr. Jin Rongzong Donates Money in Response to Midwifery Hoping for Greater Empathy and Effort from Society</h3>
<p>Mr. Jin Rongzong wrote: "The last time I donated to the midwifery fund, I received your receipt number 23. It was received correctly. Now I am enclosing a check for 3,000 yuan, which I still donate to your midwifery fund. It is my opinion that the midwifery fund that your office is advocating is of great benefit to society. However, the city has a large population and a high birth rate, especially among the lower and poorer classes. Due to economic difficulties, most of them rely on traditional methods of delivery, or are hastily handled by familiar women with some birth experience. The danger is unimaginable. Therefore, the number of people who die from difficult labor, contract diseases after childbirth, and die unnaturally each year is countless. There are even cases where both mother and child die at the same time. All of this is caused by unsanitary delivery methods. Is there anything more tragic in the world than this? Therefore, I hope that your office will make greater efforts in midwifery and promote it widely. Then the poor pregnant women in the city will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate. My humble contribution is just to provide a starting point."</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm (1)</h3>
<p>— By Tian Fengxiong, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>During the summer of 1940, the Far East crisis was rumored at least three times. Although the rumors were very prevalent, the results always disappeared unnoticed. However, the premonition of the third time, since the summer of 1941, became more and more solidified and began to linger.</p>
<p>People are bewildered by weather forecasting. Those who directly suffer the premonition are the local people. Because the central government has too many meteorological officials, opinions are divided and nothing can be decided. Some even believe that the sky is a symbol of clear weather.</p>
<p>By October, the Third Konoe Cabinet resigned en masse. When the Tojo Cabinet came to power, it felt like a sudden burst of opportunity. However, not long after, people's understanding of the five-star flag began to fade. The sharp rise in cigarette prices on November 1 may not have been caused by the silent coercion of the ABCD joint front, but by the prevailing sentiment.</p>
<p>On November 14, Roosevelt declared the seriousness of the Pacific crisis at a press conference, but at that time, our Japanese Ambassador Kurusu was flying over the Midway Islands to San Francisco. Needless to explain, diplomats are messengers of peace. The ambassador and Ambassador Nomura jointly said to the American reporters who came to greet them, "Try to find a way to slow down the situation."</p>
<p>Soon after, President Roosevelt and Hull, who stopped Thanksgiving travel, began the first negotiation with Ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu. After two or three negotiations, although it gave the general public a difficult impression, it was not considered hopeless. Nevertheless, on November 27, the U.S. Marines in Shanghai finally withdrew. Preparations for war in the Philippines were increased. Britain also increased troops in Burma and added many Indian troops to Malaya. Aircraft carriers appeared on the eastern sea of Singapore. On December 1, a fleet with the new battleship Prince of Wales as its flagship entered Singapore.</p>
<p>"The thunderstorm is finally coming."</p>
<p>Under the cloud of war, such an urgent voice came.</p>
<p>"But we can't draw conclusions yet! The increasingly complex diplomatic negotiations may suddenly improve. Even if the negotiations are fierce, there will not be an immediate conflict."</p>
<p>It seems that those who understand meteorology issued such an optimistic voice.</p>
<p>On December 5, the Japanese Imperial Government handed over the reply to the 7th U.S.-Japan Negotiation Meeting.</p>
<p>On the 7th, the newspapers suddenly published the news that the negotiations had stalled. But on this day, President Roosevelt issued a U.S. naval mobilization order.</p>
<p>Finally, the morning of December 8th arrived. The rain in the faint morning light shook the people of Japan. The misty smoke was completely blown away, and the people with their hair standing on end showed the murderous aura of early winter. Ah, no one will forget that calm and warm sky. (139)</p>
<h3>Zhongjiao Daoyi Association Civilian Canteen Extends Operations</h3>
<p>The Zhongjiao Daoyi Association on Zhengyang Road, in addition to operating charities such as providing porridge for many years, also has a civilian canteen. Each person is given one catty of white rice and free dishes every day for only five yuan. It is learned that the civilian canteen of the association, which was originally scheduled for March, will soon expire. It is planned to extend the operation to sell and provide relief, but funds are exhausted. It is requested that all sectors give their support. The association's annual medical diagnosis and medicine distribution, western medicine supplies, are also in great need, and it is hoped that major factories, pharmacies, will donate at any time.</p>
<h3>Charity Schools and Scholarships</h3>
<p>The Applied Chemistry Department of Zhonghe Senior Vocational School at 13 Nanyang Road will begin formal classes on September 11. There are still 10 remaining loan quotas for students this semester. Those with high school or equivalent qualifications who are interested in chemistry can quickly register and apply to the school.</p>
<p>In order to assist some poor members in pursuing further studies, the Taixing Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has obtained the approval of Mr. Lu Xunqing, a director of the association, who has generously donated funds to run a scholarship fund. Fellow villagers from the county who are from poor families can go to the association at 40 Maoming Road to apply for the procedure from now on.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Leiliu Obligatory Middle School has passed the entrance exam date for new students. Now that there are still quotas in each grade, new students are recruited on a rolling basis. Registration is from now until September 9, exams on the 10th, and school starts on the 11th. Tuition is free, and only 100 yuan is paid for miscellaneous fees. The school address is 64 Wuhu Road.</p>
<p>The Qiu Zhi Obligatory School waives all tuition and miscellaneous fees. Classes are held every evening from 6:00 to 9:00 PM. Enrollment for this semester begins on September 1, exams on the admission day, and classes on the 15th. Those from poor families who cannot afford to go to school or who work during the day can apply to 105, Lane 460, Datong Road (Avenyi Road), and a prospectus is available.</p>
<p>The Jianyi Commercial Department of the Hualian Middle School on the 6th floor of 255 Beijing Road is now recruiting 20 male and female free students to reward poor and ambitious young people. Registration starts immediately, and the exam will be held at the school at 2:00 PM on September 12.</p>
