<h3>大學生的當前問題</h3>
<p>我國辦大學教育，已有數十年的歷史。各機關團體以及工商事業中，大學生佔有重要地位，他們今日所表白的，就是過去數十年大學教育成效的反映。而今日的大學生，也就是十年二十年後復興建國的中堅人材，希望將來服務時勝任愉快，就需要今日加倍充實。本報有鑒於此，特繼大中小學教育座談會之後，召集大學生座談會，就當前大學生諸問題，進行懇切的商談，獲得相當美滿的結論，頗可欣幸。（座談會紀錄載今日本報第三版）我們希望類此的會談，能經常召集，大家交換意見，旣可互相砥礪，又可將意見貢獻有關當局，希望今後的大學教育有完善的改進。　　這次座談會所討論的，都是當前最迫急的具體問題，我們希望大學生，各大學當局、出版界和教育當局，特別加以注意。　　第一，關於工讀問題，原是適合中國國情的大學教育方法。不過要點就在工讀的內容必須適當配合，否則心力交疲而成功難期。所以我們希望社會上有力份子，特別是企業界方面，多多關心及此，如果在自己企業部門增開工讀學額，與有關大學合作，以培養專材，尤爲國家社會之福。同時，我們對於一般清寒的大學生，一面有繁重的課業，一面又不得不耗費其腦力勞力以維持其學業，其境況尤可同情，不過像這樣賤售勞力而其工作又與所學毫無關係，實爲不合理的現象，亟盼有關方面予以有力援助。　　第二，關於大學教材，用書及儀器問題，現在依然嚴重。首先，教材方面，是非常混雜和不合理的，大多數是在強迫學生及教授遷就教材的現狀之下。因此，[學非所用，用非所學]，爲必然的結果。我們希望教育當局能從整個國家民族的需要着眼，確定統一教材的方針。同時鼓勵及協助出版界有計劃有系統地出版大學教材。其次，關於用書問題，在統一標準尚未確定以前，我們這次大學生座談會所提出的幾點具體要求，希望有關各方面特別加以注意。此外儀器問題，實習問題，確爲今日嚴重問題，只有希望各學校爲國家社會前途計而互相合作互助，以待他日獲得滿的解決。　　第三，關於大學生本身問題及助學問題，自食宿健康乃至課外活動，這次座談會都已交換了很可寶貴的意見。我們不必再加賀語。我們特別覺得欣慰的是經過這次座談會，已決定組織申報助學金大學生團契，以謀加強同學剖或同學與助學機關的聯絡，希望負責籌辦者特別努力。此外葉同學生張舉辦研究座談會，職業教導，生活指導等，亦足以改善目前大學生生活，共同走向健全光明的前途，我們希望能早日實現。　　我們面臨新的時代？復興民族，建設國家，改造社會的重任，正待我們去擔負起來，大學生諸君！我們要更加團結更加奮發邁進！</p>

<h3>蒙古自治政府近況</h3>
<p>九月一日爲蒙古自治政府成立五周年之期。自民國二十八年九月一日蒙古大會決議，統一以前分立的各政權後，五年以來，爲遂行大東亞戰爭，所望於蒙疆之對日貢獻者愈大，日蒙打成一體，以應迫切的戰局。</p>
<h3>蒙古的維新</h3>
<p>蒙古聯合自治政府自八月起以政務院令禁止境內人民辦髪，繅足。辮髪的禁止，在蒙古人又爲恰如日本人的禁止結髪一樣，是維新的英斷。此爲蒙古民衆的意志旺盛之證明。本來很像日本人態貌的蒙古人之剪辮的姿態，愈像現在境內日本男子和尚頭一樣，這也是可喜的情景。這種外表的改變，實爲政府的行政力滲透以後戰爭意慾昂揚的表現，[現在是大東亞諸民族奮起的時候了]，在歷史的磨煉中，建築起切實的民族的感情。</p>
<h3>鞏固防衛</h3>
<p>華中華南的基地被日機破壞的敵美，轉向西北地區，爲充實基地，對延安政權進行軍事的挿足工作。在積極指導開發新疆的形勢下，隣接西北地區的蒙疆之國防的意義，愈加重要起來。　　但外蒙國境現在極爲平靜。綏遠的傳作義軍，在日軍的制壓下，不能蠶動，縱令敵美向西北推進以爲對日總反攻的一冀，防衛日滿的外綫，在日軍的守護下，亦固如鐵壁。蒙疆已發動劃時期的防衛法，不論軍官民均已有了西方防衛人的自覺。</p>
<h3>增產的猛進</h3>
<p>蒙疆的資源，被地理的情形所限，尚多未開發之地，其中龍烟的鐵與大同的煤，爲蒙疆的二大戰力資源，官民一體盡力採掘，增產增運。近經籐原查察使查察後，因地處邊僻而在資材，勞力，糧食上的困難，不久即將排除，例如龍烟鐵鑛，自八月起發動增產運動後，比七月份的生產量每日增產八成左右。至本月底止，本年度所需勞力，預料可以維持，技術方面亦經整備，故本年度增產預定量的到達，大約不成問題。</p>
<h3>連疆的儲蓄熱</h3>
<p>蒙古各地的民族祭典，在八月內大祭告終，蒙古政府的發祥地百靈廟那而，今年新建壯麗的祭塘，舉行盛大的落成典禮。政府的最下層機構，今正積極向這些草原伸展。　　例如，蒙疆唯一的純醉蒙古地帶錫林郭勒盟的西蘇尼特左旗，爲響應儲蓄運動而開設郵電局，自九月一日起開始業務，蒙古人也儲蓄了。本年度境內的儲蓄目標額，自七月起的一年間爲三億五千萬圓，比前年度的一億圓一躍而增三倍以上。這數字唯賴五族共和一致的力量，始能獲得。協力而進的五族，在這裹也顯示着蒙疆的實力。（翔：譯自八月十八晶朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>日軍續進展突入桂省境擁有堅強大東亞防衛陣綫</h3>
<p>日軍前綫二十日中央社電　日軍現已突入廣西省境，自河南湖南兩作戰以來，日軍北自洛陽，南至廣西省境北部，現已擁有蜿蜒數千公里之堅強大東亞防衛陣綫，故今後大東亞戰爭雖繼續任何時期，然對於日方已成必勝不敗之基礎。茲將本次作戰之特色及前進，分別誌次，本次作戰特色如下：　　○本次作戰中地域之廣大，規模之雄渾，用兵之神速，於戰史上實爲一劃期創舉，給予反軸心陣營之威脅，尤屬罕見。○本次作戰中，日軍按計劃逐次實現其所希望，尤足顯示日軍眞實威力，○於大陸作戰旣不以渝軍爲敵人，其目的乃在擊滅美空軍，故於衡陽陷落後，日美兩軍於大陸已突入決戰階段，○日軍作戰行動，向以道義爲出發點，故中國民衆無不欣然協力，自渝軍桎梏下解放之民衆，正積極再建鄉土，爲保衛大東亞增強戰力。本次作戰與渝軍陣容之直接影響如次：○渝軍正面防衛戰區第一第九戰區，已體無完膚，且使其心臓部之第四戰區直接遭受重壓。同時華南日軍，亦於浙贛綫地區發動攻勢，使第三第七戰區同時遭受甚大打擊。尤其防衛重慶之第六第九戰區，已成第二綫陣地，抗戰陣營，目下已臨崩潰之前夕，○駐渝美空軍於北方已被困於西安漢中以西，南方則自衍陽零陵各重要基地失陷後，日軍已直綫突入，將之東西分裂，中國沿海各基地，事實上本極無力，西南後方基地，現已直接受日空軍威脅，美空軍之機能，今已降低甚多。同時此次作戰中敵美所呼號之太平洋攻勢，即敵美自太平洋島嶼企圖打通連貫大陸路綫，企圖將日美決戰塲移至大陸，然日軍進攻湖南作戰之結果，美空軍與渝軍近接地區之空軍，並未來援，僅得與日軍展開正面作戰。日軍此次作戰圈內，有廣大且在軍事經濟上價值極大之地域，今爲防衛大東亞，已能自由組織防衛陣，以湖南人建設湖南之聲浪，予鄰直極大衝動。例如廣西省民衆，已在大廣西主義之旗幟下，挺身擊滅美空軍脫　重壓，故渝美陣營極感狼狽云</p>

<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據重慶美聯社訊，日軍夾攻廣西東南部之急進情形如下：湘桂省境日軍，已到達零陵南九十五公里之灌陽。又由廣東省西北進攻之日軍，已佔領懷集，而繼續前進。此桂林東方及東南方之兩路日軍，距離僅隔百四十餘里，日軍之進擊目標，一在截斷抗戰地區東部及東南之聯絡。一在驅逐企圖擾擾日軍海上運輸之渝美空軍基地。據渝軍司令部發表，由道縣前進之日軍，已到達主要基地之戰綫。又路透電，據渝軍公報經過道縣之日軍南進部隊，會被渝軍阻止，然其後又繼續南進，其企圖顯然在由東南包圍桂林，又廣東西北突入廣西之日軍，傳已到達梧州，北方之信都，合衆電亦謂渝軍司令部雖未確認，惟附稱接到日軍迫近桂林之不確消息云。</p>
<h3>積極貫通平漢鐵路</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地二十日中央社電　平漢鐵路連接北平漢口兩地，自停止運輸機能以來，迄今已屆七載。由於種種關係，該綫北段（由北平至新鄉間）今已恢復繁榮，其於民衆福祉之增強上貢獻極大。然大黃河以南鄭州一帶地區之該綫路軌，則已被渝軍拆毀，惟該段鐵路自黃河作戰於本年春季展開以來，已告更生，再度擔負縱貫中國之鐵路重大任務，連結北平·漢口·廣州·各地，殆四月十八日渡河（黃河）作戰勃發後，鐵路隊即肩負其重大任務，在大黃河着手完成架橋工事，并着着防衛長亙若干公里之大橋樑，排除駐渝美空軍之種種妨害，使大黃河之架橋工事，得以計日進行，藉以解決打通平漢綫之最大困難·另一方面，更加速建設，由黃河南岸通往鄭州之路綫，使之得以向南伸展。七月初旬，卡車已能由鄭州開往某地，現當局自八月起以迄九月，對於該路綫之建設工作，未嘗稍懈，期已失機能之平漢綫趨於健全，而安定中國民生，完成大東亞重要交通動脈使命之日，亦當不遠矣。</p>

<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　西綫英美軍十六日已於亞琛地方開始猛攻齊格斐綫，此攻擊是否爲對德最後決點之總攻擊，雖難確定，然對今後戰局不得不予以最大關心。反軸心軍集中猛攻之亞琛附近地區，距德重工業中心地魯爾地方關門之科隆（○ologne）祗六十五公里，是故反軸心軍今次之攻擊，實可視爲對德國心臓部之決定戰，德軍防衛力如何，對將來之戰局，實有重大影響。據英美方面發表：反軸心軍降落傘部隊與英第二軍已取得聯絡，攻略荷蘭工業部市愛恩特霍芬後，更以齊格斐防綫爲目標，繼續北進中，德方對此亦承認之。由厄爾貝特橋頭堡開始行動之英美軍於激戰後，已入恩特霍芬，然其損失極大。　　柏林二十日中央社電　據前綫消息：傳荷蘭恩特霍芬（Eindhoven）市，十九日展開激烈巷戰</p>

<h3>用其所長</h3>
<p>— 小倉正恆</p>
<p>小磯首相在八月八日第一次廣播演說時，會聲明政府的信念，同時迫切希望一億國民際此重大關頭，要高度發揮總力。他全篇的宗旨，就是爲天皇一人而鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已。爲國民者，必須按照耀於天地間的宣戰大詔所指示，竟力進行戰爭。因此，國民必須體諒政府的意旨，對於政府各種政策，必須戳力協心，以完成上下一致，精誠團結的體制。　　新內閣可以說人才濟濟，而正當此千鈞一髪的緊要關頭，我們熟烈盼望政府當局，對於施策要不容或綏地爭取時間，加以具體指示，以及堅強執行。在這一點上，謹述拙見，以供明達參考。　　今日首相所列舉的，要迅速增強武力，要安定國民生活，要施行政策等點，不一而足，然而其最根本者，就是在於振作國民精神，一切以戰事爲前提。　　首相在此次演說中，闡述皇祖天照大神的精神，認爲[物心一如]是皇國的肇國精神，老實說，這是意味深長的。物和人一樣，都是有靈魂的。物，當人使用和制造時，才把靈魂裝入，而與之相接角時，物就成爲有靈魂的生命體。這種境地就是三千年來的日本國情形，同時這也就是物心一如的道理。　　假如生產陣眞正是有靈魂的活動，則製品也就有靈魂，在戰塲上就立刻成爲武力，而能加強戰鬥力。因此每一個人都必須眞正認識時局，要把握物心一如，君國，君民二位一體的皇國本義，要站在各自職業崗位上努力奮鬥；但政府必須建立一種施策，要充分發揚三千年來傳統裹所包含着的優秀性。假如像過去那樣所採取的生產增強政策來作，而縱能官民上下一體，深自反省，能大公無私，戮力協心，但我仍然相信，過於失掉緩急之分，有時停頓萎縮，有時激昂衝動，如是則不會收到美滿的效果。　　所以政府的眼光要遠大，目前迫不容緩而應當採取的政策，就是尊重人心和加強人心，即精神第一。然在各個職業領域內，欲使人心暢達，精神滿足，我認爲就需要確立任務委託的方法，規定責任的所在。按每個人有專門技術能力等，分配工作，而對於工作必須使之負責。如讓他人作後，而就信憑他人去作，這就是日本人的特色。　　總之，這就是委人信人的大度量政策。　　以前日俄戰爭時，大山元帥一任總參謀長去運籌帷幄，這已經成爲歷史上有名的故事。兒玉大將任台灣總督的期間，也把大事一任民政局長官後藤新平伯爵去作，而才有美滿成績。後藤伯爵對於台灣按生物學所實行的殖民地政策，就是按民情，風俗，習慣等，而加以諄諄善導，使之就範。與其應用機案上的理論和書本內的法律，則莫如採取實情第一主義。兒玉大將的政治眼光和度量，在今日是有再加玩味的價值。　　政府際此這樣重大關頭，不要採取一成不變的政策，而要建立隨機應變的政策。　　在此我希望不要浪費一億國民，而要發揮民心之傾向，各得其所，各盡所能，以完成國內態勢，這是新內閣應當採取的度量。果如是，則新內閣會得到大批人才，即能如魚得水，如虎入山，各蓋所能。　　古語說：[用其所長，不存軌範]。（安譯自八月十三日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>大學生座談會</h3>

<h3>大學生座談會</h3>
<p>自第三版轉來　　第三　大學教材與實習問題　　黃警頑：目前各校教材，很多失之太舊，或不切實際，而教材與實習或實騐，更不能銜接，諸位有何意見？　　薛光圻：現在各大學用書，多爲西文，以致閱讀困難，而其內容也往往不合國情，過去商務，中華各大書局編纂大學業書，現已停頓，但希望出版界重整起來。　　挂世藩：許多大學，只注意理論，不重實際，很不合理，希望貴報提倡，舉辦實騐室或實習工廠。　　顧澤南：理工醫農科實習要緊，但設備困難，希望各大學聯合起來，打破[各自爲政]的局面，甲校所缺儀器，向乙校借用，乙校所缺儀器，向甲校借用，並希望學校與工廠醫院農塲聯絡。　　浦德生：許多學校的課程，往往不切實際，對學生志趣不合，徒然浪費時間，如讀法科者，西洋通史一科，即可取消。　　黃警頑：課程乃經教育當局及專家幾經考慮，而後訂定，不能因學生之好　而取舍不同。　　沈有乾：讀書固然應當專精，但一個有除去專門知識外，着通知識也是很重要的，很小的基礎上決不能建築高樓，所以精深與廣博，應當雙方　全。　　葉全昆：目前各校課程，太重英美制度，希望有經騐的學者教授，重編教材，第一適合國情，第二切乎實用。　　第四　大學生食宿與健康問題　　黃警頑：由於生活費的高漲，大學生的膳宿往往非常困難，加以缺乏適當的休息，大學生的健康很受影響，健全的智識，寓於健全的身體，健康是一切事業之基礎，本報助學金以健康爲甄別標準之一，希望各位多加注意。　　楊開寶：關於膳貪，我主張多創辦經濟食堂，米煤申請特種配給，以經濟與營養爲前提，若能做到，受益一定　大。　　桂世藩：有時因爲交通不便，尤其現在電車減少，若無腳踏車，回家午膳，甚感不便，最好當局配給學生麵包。　　黃警頑：同時，我們應提倡開水淘冷飯，帶飯食，可以便當得多。　　許槑：關於健康，希望貴報舉辦健康及醫藥講座，灌輸衛生常識。　　籍傳實：各校同學因功課忙，缺少運動者甚多，所以提倡運動也很重要。　　桂世藩：請求貴報舉辦免費健康檢查。　　翁履砥：欲求身體健康，鍛鍊很重要，請與精武體育會·青年會等接洽，優待學生。　　顧澤南：由於功課繁重與設備不良的關係，近視眼已成爲大學生中的流行病了，有些學校，往往在六七時以後，還要上課，而電燈光度不合，以致患近視眼的很爲普遍。　　第五　受助學生應如何互相　　聯絡及與助學機關聯絡　　黃警頑：本報辦理助學以來，已歷七屆，但與各校同學之聯絡及組織，俱未臻理想，以致效率不能提高，同時各校受助生或同一校中各級受助生中，往往毫無聯絡，現在就聯絡方法上，請各位提供意見。　　葉全昆：我們很殷切地盼望貴報舉辦下列各事：○研究座談會。○職業指導。○生活指導。　　籍傳實：暑假中貴報舉辦學術演講，同學等受益匪淺，但望繼續辦理，並加強內容。　　左淑東：今天所討論的許多問題，還有各人心中所想到還未討論的許多問題，都是因爲一個問題沒有解決，所以成了問題，這一個問題，就是聯絡問題，同學間聯絡，以及同學與助學機關或社會的聯絡，希望能夠有一種精神上或工作上的聯繫。　　沈有乾：這一點意見很好，過去我們感覺不能詳悉同學的需要，所以希望諸位同學自動成立種聯絡的機構。　　籍傳實：借今天這樣好的機會，鄙人發起組織申報助學金大學生團契，以加強同學間或同學與助學機關的聯絡爲主旨，不知諸位同意否？（全體致通過）　　黃警頑：我們除對於特種助學金受助學生加強組織外，對於你們這種組織表示贊同。（當由全體出席大學生，推舉八單位代表，負責籌備組織團契，末由交大許槑君獨唱華業歌，盡歡而散）</p>

<h3>雷雨（五）</h3>
<p>那或許是人魚雷。決不是的。我們日本海軍決不採取那種無人道而不合理的方法。東鄉司令官封鎖旅順時准許用，是由於水雷艇能收容隊員。所以——　　特別攻擊隊，是緊靠着頭部而分不開，於是隆夫認爲這樣不行，就路到飛田中校的房間去了。　　[可否畫成畫？請詳細告訴我！]　　他單純畫了空襲眞珠灣的圖，於是認爲對不起特別攻擊隊的勇士門，所以就想畫特別攻擊隊。　　[還沒到時候。]　　飛田中校脆快地說完後，身體就橫過去，忙着轉動機上電話了。　　隆夫無精打采地回到自己的房間去了。　　很快地，永遠留在日本歷史的一九四一年過去了。　　而醖釀着遠大希望的新手降臨了。　　元旦非常晴朗，而寒冷刺骨。隆夫在公寓房間內，用火盆燒着家鄉寄來的粘糕，而慶祝二十四歲的新春。　　突然想起了眞人。　　（眞人在什麼地方吃粘糕呵？在什麼地方迎接二十四歲的新年呵？）　　同年，同鄉，同南的眞人，一別無當的現在，尤其恰值新年，於是不能不使人想念。且自從大東亞戰爭以來，他甚至從未寄一張明信片來。隆夫竟把妹妹的婚姻事忘到九霄雲外，而現在只是想念莫逆的朋友。　　年假已滿，上班的日期到了，而每天又開始服務了。　　他每逢在廊上碰到飛田中校的踪影時，總想問：　　[谷中尉在什麼地方？固然我不能說想要知道軍艦的名字，但我只想知道是否在前綫上…]　　但這是不許可問的。知道自己任務以外的事情，這是海軍的犯規者。無命令而想畫特別攻擊隊，曾經失敗過，這一點又不能不想到這一點。　　於是隆夫對於眞人，不能忘記，而又不能不忘記。　　因爲一月下旬接到命令盡茵恩道海戰圖，二月中旬接到命令畫巴里島海戰圖。這兩次海戰，在形式上說固然規模很小，但在實質上，卻是值得我們海軍舉手稱幸的。前一海戰，是驅逐艦二對二的砲戰，結果日本大勝。對方是號稱全世界聞名的海軍。敵我砲術的差別，交錄結果立刻得到證明。後一戰爭，是日本驅逐艦兩艘擊潰荷蘭巡洋艦二艘和驅逐艦五艘。驅逐艦的　竟吃了巡洋艦的貓。　　隆夫每一細胞都感覺痛快，心情舒暢地畫完兩張海戰圖。並不覺怎樣壞。（一四三）</p>

<h3>The Current Problems of University Students</h3>
<p>Our country has been providing university education for several decades. University graduates occupy important positions in various organizations, groups, and industrial and commercial enterprises, and their expressions today reflect the effectiveness of university education over the past few decades. Today's university students are also the backbone of national revival and reconstruction in ten or twenty years. To ensure they are competent and happy in their future service, they need to enrich themselves even more today. In light of this, our newspaper, following the symposium on primary and secondary education, specially convened a symposium for university students to earnestly discuss the current issues facing university students, achieving quite satisfactory conclusions, which is gratifying. (The minutes of the symposium are published on page three of today's newspaper.) We hope that similar meetings can be convened regularly for everyone to exchange opinions, both encouraging each other and contributing opinions to relevant authorities, hoping for comprehensive improvements in future university education. The discussions at this symposium focused on the most urgent and concrete problems of the moment. We hope that university students, university authorities, the publishing industry, and educational authorities will pay special attention to them. First, regarding the work-study program, it is originally a university education method that suits China's national conditions. However, the key is that the content of the work-study program must be appropriately matched; otherwise, both mental and physical energy will be exhausted, and success will be difficult to achieve. Therefore, we hope that influential members of society, especially in the business sector, will pay more attention to this and increase the number of work-study positions in their own business departments, cooperating with relevant universities to cultivate specialized talents, which would be a blessing for the country and society. At the same time, we sympathize with the situation of general poor university students who, on the one hand, have heavy academic work, and on the other hand, have to spend their mental and physical labor to maintain their studies. However, it is an unreasonable phenomenon to sell labor cheaply, and the work has nothing to do with what they are studying. We urgently hope that relevant parties will provide strong assistance. Second, the problems concerning university teaching materials, textbooks, and equipment are still serious. First of all, the teaching materials are very mixed and unreasonable. Most of them force students and professors to adapt to the current state of the teaching materials. Therefore, [what is learned is not applied, and what is applied is not learned] is an inevitable result. We hope that the educational authorities can focus on the needs of the entire country and nation and determine the direction of unified teaching materials. At the same time, we encourage and assist the publishing industry to publish university teaching materials in a planned and systematic way. Secondly, regarding the textbook issue, before a unified standard has been determined, we hope that the various specific requirements put forward by this university student symposium will be given special attention by all relevant parties. In addition, the problems of equipment and practice are indeed serious problems today. We can only hope that all schools will cooperate and help each other for the sake of the country and society's future, waiting for a satisfactory solution in the future. Third, regarding the issues of university students themselves and student aid, from food, accommodation, and health to extracurricular activities, this symposium has exchanged very valuable opinions. We don't need to add more praise. We are particularly pleased that after this symposium, it was decided to organize a "Shen Bao" Student Aid University Fellowship to strengthen communication between students or between students and student aid organizations. We hope that those responsible for planning and organizing will make special efforts. In addition, student Zhang's organization of research seminars, vocational guidance, and life guidance can also improve the current university student life and jointly move towards a healthy and bright future. We hope that it can be realized as soon as possible. We are facing a new era? The heavy responsibility of reviving the nation, building the country, and transforming society is waiting for us to shoulder. University students! We must unite and strive forward even more!</p>

<h3>Ministry of Health Investigates and Registers Anesthetic Drugs</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Recently, the source of anesthetic drugs has been cut off, and various hospitals and doctors have found it extremely difficult to obtain these drugs.

However, a detailed investigation should also be conducted on those hospitals, pharmacies, doctors, dentists, veterinarians, and ordinary merchants who have old stocks of anesthetic drugs, and they should be registered within a time limit for unified management. The Ministry has now printed registration forms, limiting the registration period from September 21 to October 20 of this year. All types and quantities of anesthetic drugs currently stored by various hospitals, doctors, and ordinary merchants should be applied for registration by submitting or mailing the forms obtained from the Ministry within the time limit. This method is uniform throughout the country, and the purpose is to investigate the amount of anesthetic drugs stored in order to clarify the supply and demand situation, and there is no fact of issuing purchases.

<h3>Chongqing's Pan-East Commando Brigade Commander Participates in the Peace Movement; He Kaixuan Leads His Troops to Return</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Pacification Headquarters of the Border Area of the Four Provinces of Henan, Shaanxi, Hubei, and Anhui, since its establishment in Xuchang on September 1, has had a great impact on the Chongqing army's resistance camp in the area. Furthermore, due to the strong promotion of the pacification work, Chongqing generals finally appeared to participate in the peace camp. Namely, Mr. He Kaixuan, the third brigade commander and fourth regiment commander of the Chongqing Pan-East Commando (Chen Wenxin, Commander-in-Chief of Eastern Henan), led his subordinates, the fourth regiment, 13,000 people, to participate in the peace camp. According to reports, Brigade Commander He and Lieutenant General Li Yulin, the Pacification Director, are both from the Northeast and are classmates of the Fengtian Military Academy. Brigade Commander He's participation in the peace movement this time has sharply reduced the strength of the Chongqing Pan-East Commando, which may collapse. At the beginning of this Henan operation, Brigade Commander He felt the meaninglessness of the resistance war. When the Japanese army attacked, he did not accept the orders from above and remained inactive to observe the situation. With the establishment of the Pacification Director's Office this time, he finally decided to lead his troops to participate in the peace movement. Major General Guo Shoutian, the acting regiment commander of the He Regiment, held negotiations in Huangling (35 kilometers east of Xuchang), and the result was a success. Brigade Commander He and Lieutenant General Li Yulin, in Xuchang, have now shaken hands after eight years of separation.</p>
<h3>German Embassy Military Attaché Arrives in China to Take Office</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – Captain Reinhard, a military officer of the German Embassy, has been appointed as the Military Attaché. The Captain officially assumed his duties a few days ago and visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and relevant agencies.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Mongolian Autonomous Government</h3>
<p>September 1 marks the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Mongolian Autonomous Government. Since the Mongolian Congress resolved on September 1, 1939, to unify the formerly separate political powers, the contribution expected from Mongolia to Japan for the purpose of carrying out the Greater East Asia War has become greater, and Japan and Mongolia have become one body to respond to the urgent war situation.</p>
<h3>Mongolia's Reformation</h3>
<p>Since August, the Mongolian United Autonomous Government has banned its people from wearing queues and binding feet by order of the Political Affairs Council. The prohibition of queues is, for Mongolians, like the Japanese prohibition of wearing topknots; it is a wise decision of reform. This is proof of the vigorous will of the Mongolian people. The appearance of Mongolians, who already resemble Japanese people, cutting off their queues is increasingly like the shaved heads of Japanese men and monks in the territory, which is also a gratifying scene. This kind of external change is really a manifestation of the government's administrative power penetrating and the soaring desire for war, [now is the time for the nations of Greater East Asia to rise up], and in the crucible of history, building a solid national sentiment.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Defense</h3>
<p>The enemy Americans, whose bases in Central and South China have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft, are turning to the Northwest region to enrich their bases and are engaging in military intervention in the Yan'an regime. In the context of actively guiding the development of Xinjiang, the significance of the national defense of Mengjiang, which borders the Northwest region, is becoming more and more important. But the Outer Mongolian border is now extremely calm. The Fu Zuoyi army in Suiyuan, under the suppression of the Japanese army, cannot encroach. Even if the enemy Americans advance to the Northwest in the hope of a general counteroffensive against Japan, the outer line of defense of Japan and Manchuria, under the protection of the Japanese army, is as solid as a steel wall. Mengjiang has launched a landmark defense law, and officials and civilians alike have the awareness of Western defenders.</p>
<h3>A Fierce Advance in Increased Production</h3>
<p>Mengjiang's resources are limited by geographical circumstances, and there are still many undeveloped areas. Among them, Longyan's iron and Datong's coal are Mengjiang's two major war resources. Officials and civilians are working together to mine and transport them to increase production. Recently, after Inspector Fujiwara's inspection, the difficulties in materials, labor, and food due to the remote location will soon be eliminated. For example, since the launch of the increased production movement at the Longyan Iron Mine in August, the production volume has increased by about 80% per day compared to July. By the end of this month, the labor force required for this year is expected to be maintained. Technical aspects have also been arranged, so it is not a problem to reach the planned increase in production for this year.</p>
<h3>The Savings Fever in the Combined Territory</h3>
<p>The national festivals in various parts of Mongolia came to a grand end in August. In Bailingmiao, the birthplace of the Mongolian government, a magnificent sacrificial pond was newly built this year, and a grand inauguration ceremony was held. The lowest-level agencies of the government are now actively extending to these grasslands. For example, Xisunit Left Banner, the only purely Mongolian area in Mengjiang's Xilingol League, opened a post and telecommunications bureau in response to the savings movement. It started operations on September 1, and Mongolians are also saving. The savings target amount in the territory for this year is 350 million yuan for the year from July, which is more than triple the increase from the previous year's 100 million yuan. This figure can only be achieved with the united strength of the Five Races. The five races working together are also showing the strength of Mengjiang here.

<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Advance and Enters Guangxi Province; Possesses a Strong Greater East Asia Defense Line</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the front line, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army has now broken into Guangxi Province. Since the operations in Henan and Hunan, the Japanese army, north from Luoyang to the northern border of Guangxi Province in the south, now possesses a strong Greater East Asia defense line stretching thousands of kilometers. Therefore, even if the Greater East Asia War continues for any period of time, the foundation for the Japanese side has become one of certain victory and invincibility. The characteristics and progress of this operation are recorded separately as follows: The characteristics of this operation are as follows: ○ The vastness of the area, the magnificence of the scale, and the speed of troop use in this operation are truly landmark innovations in the history of war, and the threat it poses to the anti-Axis camp is especially rare. ○ In this operation, the Japanese army has gradually realized its hopes according to plan, which is enough to show the true power of the Japanese army. ○ In the continental operation, the Chongqing army is not regarded as the enemy, and its purpose is to destroy the US Air Force. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang, the Japanese and US armies on the mainland have entered the decisive battle stage. ○ The Japanese army's combat operations have always started from morality, so the Chinese people are happy to cooperate. The people liberated from the shackles of the Chongqing army are actively rebuilding their hometowns to enhance their combat power to defend Greater East Asia. The direct impact of this operation on the Chongqing army's lineup is as follows: ○ The Chongqing army's front-line defense areas, the First and Ninth War Zones, have been completely destroyed, and the Fourth War Zone, its heart, has been directly subjected to heavy pressure. At the same time, the Japanese army in South China also launched an offensive in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line area, causing the Third and Seventh War Zones to suffer great blows at the same time. In particular, the Sixth and Ninth War Zones, which defend Chongqing, have become second-line positions, and the resistance camp is now on the eve of collapse. ○ The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been trapped west of Xi'an and Hanzhong in the north, and in the south, since the fall of important bases such as Hengyang and Lingling, the Japanese army has directly entered and split it from east to west. The Chinese coastal bases are in fact extremely weak, and the southwest rear base is now directly threatened by the Japanese Air Force. The function of the US Air Force has been greatly reduced today. At the same time, in this operation, the Pacific offensive called for by the enemy Americans, that is, the enemy Americans' attempt to open up a connected continental route from the Pacific islands, attempting to move the Japanese-US decisive battle ground to the mainland, but as a result of the Japanese army's offensive in Hunan, the US Air Force and the Chongqing army's air force in the adjacent area did not come to aid, and only engaged in a frontal battle with the Japanese army. In the combat circle of this operation, there is a vast area with great military and economic value. Now, for the defense of Greater East Asia, a defense formation can be freely organized. The voice of Hunan people building Hunan has given neighboring areas a great impetus. For example, the people of Guangxi Province have stood up under the banner of Greater Guangxiism to destroy the US Air Force and escape heavy pressure, so the Chongqing-American camp is extremely embarrassed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks Southeastern Guangxi on Two Fronts</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a United Press report from Chongqing, the rapid advance of the Japanese army attacking southeastern Guangxi on two fronts is as follows: The Japanese army in the Hunan-Guangxi border area has reached Guanyang, 95 kilometers south of Lingling. In addition, the Japanese army advancing from northwestern Guangdong Province has occupied Huaiji and continues to advance. The two Japanese armies east and southeast of Guilin are only 140 li apart. The Japanese army's offensive objectives are to cut off the connection between the eastern and southeastern parts of the resistance area and to expel the Chongqing-American air force bases attempting to disrupt Japanese maritime transport. According to the Chongqing Army Headquarters, the Japanese army advancing from Daoxian has reached the front line of the main base. Furthermore, according to Reuters, a communique from the Chongqing Army stated that the Japanese troops advancing south through Daoxian were blocked by the Chongqing Army, but they continued to advance southward thereafter, their attempt being obviously to encircle Guilin from the southeast. In addition, the Japanese troops who broke into Guangxi from northwestern Guangdong were rumored to have reached Wuzhou, and Xindu in the north. The United News Agency also stated that although the Chongqing Army Headquarters did not confirm it, it was added that it had received unconfirmed news of the Japanese army approaching Guilin.</p>
<h3>Actively Connecting the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>A certain base on the Japanese front lines, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Pinghan Railway, connecting Beijing and Hankou, has been out of service for seven years. Due to various reasons, the northern section of the line (from Beijing to Xinxiang) has now been restored to prosperity, making a great contribution to enhancing the welfare of the people. However, the railway tracks south of the Yellow River in the Zhengzhou area have been dismantled by the Chongqing army. However, since the Yellow River operation began this spring, this section of the railway has been revitalized and once again assumed the major task of a railway running through China, connecting Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. Almost immediately after the Yellow River crossing operation erupted on April 18, the railway team took on its major task, starting bridge construction on the Yellow River and defending the several-kilometer-long bridge, eliminating various obstructions by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, so that the Yellow River bridge construction could proceed on schedule, thereby solving the greatest difficulty in opening up the Pinghan Line. On the other hand, construction was accelerated to extend the line south from the south bank of the Yellow River to Zhengzhou. By early July, trucks were able to travel from Zhengzhou to a certain place. Currently, from August to September, the authorities have not slackened their efforts in the construction of this line, hoping that the Pinghan Line, which has lost its function, will become sound, and the day when the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood and the completion of the important transportation artery mission of Greater East Asia will be realized is not far away.</p>

<h3>German Army Determined to Defend the Ruhr Area at All Costs: Street Fighting in Eindhoven</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) British and American forces on the Western Front launched a fierce offensive on the Siegfried Line in the Aachen area on the 16th. Although it is difficult to determine whether this offensive is the final decisive general attack on Germany, the future course of the war must be given the utmost attention. The area near Aachen, where the anti-Axis forces are concentrating their attacks, is only 65 kilometers away from Cologne, the gateway to the Ruhr region, the center of German heavy industry. Therefore, this attack by the anti-Axis forces can be regarded as a decisive battle for the heart of Germany. The strength of the German defenses will have a major impact on the future course of the war. According to a statement from the British and American sides, the anti-Axis parachute troops have made contact with the British Second Army and, after capturing Eindhoven, an industrial city in the Netherlands, are continuing to advance north towards the Siegfried Line. The German side also acknowledges this. British and American forces, starting from the Erle bridgehead, entered Eindhoven after fierce fighting, but suffered heavy losses.</p>

<h3>Using Their Strengths</h3>
<p>— Masatsune Ogura</p>
<p>In his first broadcast speech on August 8, Prime Minister Koiso stated the government's beliefs and urgently hoped that the 100 million citizens would give full play to their total strength at this critical juncture. The purpose of his entire speech was to devote himself to the Emperor and die for him. As citizens, they must carry out the war vigorously as indicated in the declaration of war shining in the world. Therefore, the people must understand the government's intentions and cooperate fully with the government's various policies to complete a system of unity from top to bottom and sincere unity. It can be said that the new cabinet is full of talents, and at this critical moment, we earnestly hope that the government authorities will seize the time without hesitation and give concrete instructions and strong implementation. On this point, I would like to state my humble opinions for the reference of those who are wise. Today, the points listed by the Prime Minister, such as rapidly strengthening military power, stabilizing people's lives, and implementing policies, are all indispensable. However, the most fundamental thing lies in revitalizing the national spirit, with everything based on the war. In this speech, the Prime Minister elaborated on the spirit of the Imperial Ancestor Amaterasu Omikami, and believed that "unity of matter and spirit" is the founding spirit of the Imperial State. Frankly speaking, this is meaningful. Matter, like people, has a soul. When matter is used and manufactured by people, it is imbued with a soul. When it interacts with people, matter becomes a living entity with a soul. This situation has been the case in Japan for three thousand years, and this is the principle of unity of matter and spirit. If production is truly a soulful activity, then the products will also have souls, and they will immediately become military power on the battlefield and can strengthen combat effectiveness. Therefore, everyone must truly understand the current situation, grasp the inherent meaning of the Imperial State of unity of matter and spirit, and unity of the monarch and the people, and strive to work hard in their respective professional positions. However, the government must establish a policy to fully promote the excellence inherent in the three thousand years of tradition. If we adopt the production enhancement policies taken in the past, and even if the government and the people, from top to bottom, deeply reflect on themselves, are selfless, and work together, I still believe that it will not achieve satisfactory results if we lose sight of the urgency, sometimes stagnate and shrink, and sometimes become激昂 and impulsive. Therefore, the government must have a broad vision. The policy that must be adopted urgently at present is to respect people's hearts and strengthen people's hearts, that is, spirit first. However, in order to make people's hearts畅达 and spirits satisfied in various professional fields, I believe that it is necessary to establish a method of entrusting tasks and stipulating where responsibilities lie. Work should be assigned according to each person's special technical abilities, etc., and they must be held responsible for the work. It is a characteristic of the Japanese to let others do the work and then trust others to do it. In short, this is a policy of generosity in entrusting and trusting people. In the past, during the Russo-Japanese War, it has become a famous story in history that Marshal Oyama entrusted the Chief of General Staff to make decisions. During the term of General Kodama as Governor-General of Taiwan, he also entrusted the important affairs to Count Goto Shinpei, the Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau, which resulted in satisfactory results. Count Goto's colonial policy in Taiwan, implemented according to biology, was based on the local conditions, customs, and habits, and he谆谆善导 to make them follow the rules. Rather than applying theoretical theories and legal laws in books, it is better to adopt the principle of reality first. General Kodama's political vision and tolerance are worth considering again today. At such an important juncture, the government should not adopt a static policy, but should establish a policy of adapting to changing circumstances. Here, I hope that we will not waste the 100 million citizens, but will give full play to the people's hearts, each in their place, each doing their best, to complete the domestic situation. This is the measure that the new cabinet should adopt. If so, the new cabinet will get a large number of talents, that is, they can be like fish in water and like tigers in the mountains, each covering their abilities. The ancients said: "Use their strengths, do not adhere to the rules." (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, August 13)</p>

<h3>Customs Director Talks About Preventing Customs Officials from Engaging in Malpractice, Hoping for Enthusiastic Assistance and Cooperation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Mr. Kurosawa Jiro, the director of the Jianghai Customs, met with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday morning and made the following statement: In order to prevent customs officials from engaging in illegal activities such as accepting bribes and selling positions, the Customs has issued a notice yesterday, hoping that all sectors will assist in reporting.</p>
<h3>Cooperation from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Maintaining customs discipline and providing convenience to merchants within the possible scope is the consistent policy of the customs colleagues. This time, the work I initiated to prevent malpractice is a necessary measure. However, the current environment is special, and it cannot be achieved only by the efforts of the customs itself. In order to thoroughly prevent malpractice, I sincerely hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will provide sincere and enthusiastic cooperation to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If any sector discovers any improper incidents involving customs officials outside the Customs, or has any dissatisfaction with the Customs' administration, they can report to the Customs Director or one of the following official agencies in writing or orally. ○ Inspectors of the Anti-Smuggling Division of the Customs General Administration, ○ Chief of the Surveillance Section of this Customs, ○ The person in charge of the card office to which the case belongs, ○ Inspectors of the Surveillance Team of this Customs, ○ Police Chief of the Port Police Department of this Customs. Once the above personnel receive reports from all sectors, they have the responsibility to immediately forward the report to the Customs Director, report the facts, and be responsible for investigating the facts.</p>
<h3>Persons in Charge</h3>
<p>The above items ○○○2 are the original organization of this Customs. Item 4, the Surveillance Team of this Customs, is a newly created organization of this Customs. Its purpose is to facilitate people from all walks of life to report to me. Sometimes, people from all walks of life often cannot write reports in time, or because the locations of the card offices are limited, they do not have enough time, thus losing the timeliness and opportunity to report, which is regrettable. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the organization of the Surveillance Team of this Customs was created. The selection of personnel was very cautious in advance, but it is not a fixed position. Every day, it is temporarily designated and assigned from the external and internal affairs staff to patrol and monitor the Customs and various card offices. All personnel on duty wear armbands with red backgrounds and white characters, with the words "[Jianghai Customs Surveillance Team]" to make it easy for all sectors to identify. The above item (1) is the Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration. Their patrol area is not limited to Shanghai. They often send personnel to various places and outports for inspection and patrol. Recently, the Customs established a surveillance team to strengthen the eradication of all inappropriate incidents in this Customs and various card offices and to facilitate the general merchants and people. I hope that all sectors will pay attention. In addition, the members of the Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration will also wear armbands with red backgrounds and white characters, with the words "[Anti-Smuggling Patrol Team of the Customs General Administration]" to make it easy for the public to identify and accept reports from the outside world. I hope that all sectors will understand and pay attention to the above points, and give close cooperation and assistance. I am very grateful.</p>
<h3>Citywide Self-Defense Corps Members Begin Registration</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Self-Defense Corps of the City's Baojia has been established and has begun to register members of the citywide self-defense corps and compile rosters. The headquarters has printed member rosters and handed them over to the general Lianbao of each district to instruct the Bao chiefs (i.e., squad leaders) to be responsible for filling out five copies in a unified format, stamping them at each level, and submitting them. All men aged 18 to 45, regardless of whether they are serving in the military or should be exempt from service, must be reported without concealment or omission.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Replaces Branch Office Section Chiefs</h3>
<p>The City Police Bureau has adjusted and replaced the section chiefs of each branch office. Chen Jinzhang, the general affairs section chief of the Lao Zha Branch Office, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the Jing'an Temple Branch Office. The vacancy was filled by Wang Wenju, the police defense section chief of the Taishan Road Branch Office. Zhu Jihuang, the original Baojia section chief of the Jing'an Temple Branch Office, was transferred to the personnel section of the general affairs office. Wu Daozhen, the general affairs section chief of the Lujiawan Branch Office, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the Huashan Road Branch Office. Ma Zemin, the police defense section chief, was transferred to the Baojia section chief of the bureau. Wang Lubai, the original Baojia section chief, was transferred to the general affairs section chief of the bureau. Qian Ruose, a second-class police officer of the Huangpu Branch Office, was transferred to the police defense section chief of the Lujiawan Branch Office.</p>
<h3>Savings Association Designs Savings Gift Certificates</h3>
<p>Sending flower baskets and wreaths for relatives' weddings, funerals, and celebrations, and store openings consumes a great deal of material resources. In view of this, the Shanghai Special City Savings Association has formulated the "[Implementation Measures for Flower Basket and Wreath Replacement Certificates]" to save unnecessary consumption and has been approved by the Social Welfare Bureau for implementation. All Shanghai citizens who give flower baskets, wreaths, or commemorative scrolls, as well as silver shields, silver cups, or framed mirrors and other physical gifts for relatives' weddings, funerals, and celebrations, should uniformly send replacement certificates (or savings gift certificates) in accordance with the provisions of these measures. The replacement certificates are divided into the following types: (A) "Fu" character certificate, each with a face value of 2,000 yuan in national currency; (B) Special certificate, each with a face value of 1,000 yuan in national currency; (C) Type A certificate, each with a face value of 500 yuan in national currency; (D) Type B certificate, each with a face value of 100 yuan in national currency. The styles and sizes of various replacement certificates are designed by the Shanghai Special City Savings Association and reported to the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau for approval. Various social groups, newspapers, banks, money houses, and shops in Shanghai may print and sell them in accordance with the format. When the certificate holder comes to the original issuing office to exchange it for cash, it should be paid in full according to the face value of the certificate and should not create additional items to deduct commissions.</p>
<h3>This Period's Sugar Purchase Coupons to be Sold with Joint Allocation Tickets</h3>
<p>The 15th period's sugar ration will be sold on the 23rd. However, the authorities now stipulate that within the old First District, purchases will be made with joint allocation tickets. Because the numbers of the various retailers are different, at the beginning of this reform, there are concerns that citizens may not know the store addresses of the numbers on their tickets. The Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office has printed a list of store names, addresses, and sales numbers for distribution to each store for citizens to inquire.</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Association Plans to Establish Nine District Offices in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Supervise Entrusted Merchants in Purchasing Coarse Grains</h3>

It is reported that the association has drafted a plan and will proceed with preparations immediately.</p>

Thanks to the guidance and assistance of the government and allied nations, the development of the university has progressed day by day, and we feel the increasing importance of our future responsibilities. The 22 graduating students of this year's agricultural science department were urged by all parties to start serving in the summer vacation of this year, but only met a quarter of the requirements of all parties. Regarding the advance service of some before the summer vacation, considering the very rapid progress of all parties on the production increase movement, after discussion with the professors, we recognized the importance of practice. At the beginning of this semester, we specially appointed Lu Xijun as the dean of the College of Agriculture of our university. Also, considering that some students are very interested in the study of law, we established a Department of Law in addition to the Department of Political Economy, and invited Xu Weizhen, the former president of the High Court, as the director. In addition, we have hired many scholars to teach at the university." Subsequently, the representative of Minister of Education Li, the representative of Mayor Chen, and the representative of Minister Usami gave speeches one after another, and each gave an incisive explanation of the responsibility of college students, agricultural increase, and the important awareness of the concept of the current situation. Finally, President Zhao awarded graduation diplomas, and the student representative gave a reply before the ceremony ended.</p>

<h3>Please Negotiate with the French Tram Company</h3>
<p>This time, the French Tram Company increased fares arbitrarily without the approval of the authorities, reaching as much as 150 percent. We will not discuss whether trams are public utilities and should not increase fares suddenly, even from the point of view of not being approved, the company's authorities have disregarded the dignity of the law, which is already undisguised. This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers expressing great dissatisfaction with the French Tram Company's illegal measures and unreasonable price increases, which shows that public opinion cannot be underestimated. At the same time, the amount overcharged by the company due to price increases in the five days from the 15th to the 19th is equal to all of the company's income for seven and a half days on weekdays. This money is the citizens' sweat and blood, and the company is not allowed to take it illegally. It should be requested that the municipal government negotiate to recover it, and under the principle of [taken from the people, used for the people], it should be used as student aid funds for poor citizens' children. We agree with the readers' suggestion that the company's overcharge of fares without approval is illegal income and should be handed over in full for social welfare and charitable undertakings. We urgently hope that the authorities will negotiate according to law to maintain the authority of the law.</p>

<h3>University Student Forum</h3>
<p>After this newspaper held three education forums for universities, middle schools, and primary schools on the 4th, 6th, and 8th of this month, in order to review the future study direction with the student aid recipients of this newspaper, a university student forum was held at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association at 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month. More than 50 university students from various aided schools attended, and the forum was still chaired by Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the Social Service Department of this newspaper. The main points of the record are as follows: Huang Jingwan: Students, today's university student forum is the first collective conversation between this newspaper and the aided students since the student aid movement. Looking at the atmosphere of today's meeting, I deeply feel the bright future of everyone. There are very few gatherings of university students nowadays, and it is especially not easy to gather together and speak freely today. This newspaper has always been very concerned about the depression of young people, and has been running student aid for seven sessions. Seeing you - the seeds of the nation - wandering on divergent paths, we have been trying our best to protect you at all times. Fortunately, with the assistance of all sectors of society, although the work has not yet reached the ideal level, we are willing to stand on the same line with you with the ideal of running a joint university. Today is a very rare opportunity, and I hope everyone will give full play to it, but before the meeting, there is one thing to report, that is, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the former director of the student aid fund committee of this newspaper, has now passed away. Mr. Zhang was very enthusiastic about student aid work during his lifetime, and we should silently commemorate Mr. Zhang today. Shen Youqian: Our student aid fund office often hears and sees verbal and written thanks from aided students. In addition to conveying our thanks to the donors, we deeply feel that verbal or written thanks are unnecessary and insufficient. On the donor's side, what they hope for is not thanks, but results. Therefore, good grades and results are the most meaningful and valuable gratitude. On the student's side, [the ancient scholars studied for themselves, and the present scholars study for others]. The good or bad of our grades is certainly not specially prepared for others to see, but we should not disappoint the society, but should use the effect to encourage and strengthen the sympathy of the society. I hope everyone will keep this in mind. Regarding today's forum, I hope everyone will speak freely, without having to stipulate a topic. Everyone can talk freely about various issues related to the student aid movement and education. First The use of books and instruments by university students Huang Jingwan: At present, everything is expensive, and university students have a heavy burden for books and instruments in addition to tuition fees. They are both expensive and scarce, and difficult to buy. Everyone may wish to discuss this. Hou Renmin: The books used by universities are mostly of a specialized nature, and the printing bureaus are almost limited to one or two, so it is easy to have a situation where people in and out of the industry hide in seclusion and act strangely. Please ask your newspaper to take a stand in the public opinion field and expose it based on the facts. Xu : University books are often needed for reference outside of professors' classes, such as manuals, etc. Furthermore, specialized books are often annotated, so borrowing is really difficult. In addition to hoping that bookstores will publish and sell more, we also hope that major libraries will circulate more rare or out-of-print reference books. Regarding instruments, we hope that universities can [communicate with each other] and borrow from each other to make up for deficiencies. Ji Chuanbao: University books are mostly pirated, and it is very difficult to find old books. I hope your newspaper will run a book lending service or an old book service agency, either borrowing or selling, to avoid unscrupulous merchants monopolizing and profiting. Xue Guangqi: The difficulty of using books is first that they are too expensive, and second that there are too few. To remedy this, there are two methods that can be promoted: ○Please contact bookstores and give special discounts to student aid students. ○Please allow student aid students to read for free or at half price at major libraries, and increase academic books Second Work-study issues Huang Jingwan: Work-study issues are very important at present. First, it can solve part of the living problem, and second, it can implement the proposition of integrating knowledge and action. What are your difficulties and feelings about work-study? Please express your opinions. Gu Zenan: The work-study of university students is mostly as tutors or part-time teachers in middle schools. There are two difficulties: ○It is very difficult to find service opportunities. Please ask your newspaper's social service department to assist in solving this. ○Tutors are often not valued in terms of concept, resulting in meager treatment. Middle schools also pay low wages for university students to teach part-time. These are all incorrect in terms of concept. Please ask your newspaper to advocate valuing work-study. Yang Kaibao: On the student's side, the difficulties of work-study are the conflict of time and the incompatibility of interests. It is best for those who study engineering to work in factories, and those who study accounting to work in stores, so that studying and practice can be integrated. However, this is probably very difficult. In the industrial and commercial circles, university students seem to be not very welcome because of their lower ability to handle affairs. Hou Renmin: I hope your newspaper will run voluntary schools so that university students have service opportunities. Xu 槑: Xu My school has heavy homework, and work-study is very difficult for the sake of health. Furthermore, the school curriculum cannot take into account the actual situation. The root cause is still the problem of the education system. The following turns to page 4</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<h3>University Student Forum</h3>
<p>Continued from page 3 Third University textbooks and internship issues Huang Jingwan: At present, many of the textbooks used by various schools are too old or impractical, and textbooks and internships or experiments cannot be connected. What are your opinions? Xue Guangqi: The books used by universities now are mostly in Western languages, which makes reading difficult, and their content is often not in line with national conditions. In the past, major bookstores such as Commercial Press and China Bookstore compiled university books, but now they have stopped. However, I hope that the publishing industry will reorganize. Gua Shifan: Many universities only pay attention to theory and not to practice, which is very unreasonable. I hope your newspaper will promote the establishment of experimental rooms or training factories. Gu Zenan: Internships in science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture are important, but equipment is difficult. I hope that universities will unite and break the [separate administrations] situation. Schools can borrow instruments from each other to make up for deficiencies, and I hope that schools will contact factories, hospitals, and farms. Pu Desen: The curriculum of many schools is often impractical and does not meet the interests of students, which is a waste of time. For example, those who study law can cancel the course of Western General History. Huang Jingwan: The curriculum is formulated after careful consideration by the education authorities and experts, and cannot be chosen or discarded differently because of the students' preferences. Shen Youqian: It is true that reading should be specialized, but a person with knowledge in addition to professional knowledge is also very important. High-rise buildings can never be built on a very small foundation, so specialization and breadth should be both sides. Ye Quankun: At present, the curriculum of various schools is too focused on the British and American systems. I hope that experienced scholars and professors will re-compile textbooks that are suitable for national conditions and practical. Fourth University students' food, lodging, and health issues Huang Jingwan: Due to the rising cost of living, university students often have very difficult food and lodging, and their health is affected by the lack of proper rest. Sound knowledge resides in a sound body, and health is the foundation of all undertakings. This newspaper's student aid fund takes health as one of the screening criteria, and I hope that everyone will pay more attention. Yang Kaibao: Regarding diet, I advocate establishing more economic cafeterias and applying for special rations for rice and coal, with economy and nutrition as the premise. If this can be done, the benefits will be great. Gui Shifan: Sometimes it is inconvenient because of transportation, especially now that there are fewer trams. If there is no bicycle, it is very inconvenient to go home for lunch. It is best for the authorities to distribute bread to students. Huang Jingwan: At the same time, we should advocate washing cold rice with boiled water and bringing meals, which can be much more convenient. Xu 槑: Regarding health, I hope your newspaper will hold health and medical lectures to instill health knowledge. Ji Chuanshi: Many students in various schools lack exercise because they are busy with their studies, so it is also important to promote exercise. Gui Shifan: Please ask your newspaper to hold free health checkups. Weng Ludi: To be healthy, exercise is very important. Please contact Jingwu Gymnastics Association and YMCA to give preferential treatment to students. Gu Zenan: Due to the heavy homework and poor equipment, myopia has become an epidemic among university students. Some schools often have classes after six or seven o'clock, and the brightness of the lights is not suitable, so myopia is very common. Fifth How should aided students contact each other and contact the student aid organization Huang Jingwan: This newspaper has been running student aid for seven sessions, but the contact and organization with students from various schools have not been ideal, so the efficiency cannot be improved. At the same time, there is often no contact between aided students from various schools or aided students from various grades in the same school. Now, please provide your opinions on the contact methods. Ye Quankun: We earnestly hope that your newspaper will hold the following events: ○Research seminar. ○Career guidance. ○Life guidance. Ji Chuanshi: During the summer vacation, your newspaper held academic lectures, and the students benefited a lot. We hope to continue to run them and strengthen the content. Zuo Shudong: Many of the problems discussed today, as well as the many problems that everyone has thought about but have not yet discussed, are all because one problem has not been solved, so they have become problems. This one problem is the problem of contact, contact between students, and contact between students and student aid organizations or society. I hope that there can be a kind of spiritual or work connection. Shen Youqian: This opinion is very good. In the past, we felt that we could not understand the needs of the students in detail, so we hope that you students will automatically establish such a contact mechanism. Ji Chuanshi: Taking advantage of today's good opportunity, I propose to organize a Shanghai Newspaper Student Aid University Student Fellowship to strengthen the contact between students or between students and student aid organizations. I wonder if you agree? (The whole body passed) Huang Jingwan: In addition to strengthening the organization of special student aid students, we express our approval of your organization. (All the university students present elected eight unit representatives to be responsible for preparing to organize the fellowship, and finally Xu 槑 from Jiaotong University sang the Huaye Song, and everyone dispersed happily)</p>
<h3>Houletang Generously Donates 100,000 Yuan for Medical Aid Fund</h3>
<p>The owner of Houletang, with a heart of hunger and thirst, and a desire for charity, generously donated 100,000 yuan to this office's medical aid fund yesterday. I am deeply moved by this, and on behalf of the poor and sick who will benefit, I would like to express my gratitude. The purpose of this office's medical aid fund is to relieve the poor and sick and relieve suffering. We sincerely hope that all sectors of society will follow suit and donate continuously to benefit the poor and sick. Also, Mr. Zhang of Zhide Hall, Sun Mei, Xie Tianxi, Yan Guangyong, and Cai Zhao's, each donated a large sum of money to respond to the midwifery aid, benefiting poor women, which is very commendable.</p>
<h3>Donating Baofu Method</h3>
<p>The number of copies of the Baofu Method sold by this office since it was reprinted has been less than a hundred. It was disclosed by this office a few days ago, and we respectfully ask charitable gentlemen to donate funds to print it so that the book will not go out of print. Afterwards, the owner of Kuqi sent 3,000 copies, each of which is still sold for 10 yuan, and the income is used to subsidize the poor. The owner of Kuqi has donated the Baofu Method three times. In addition, Mr. Zhang Shuchui of Nanyang Sock Factory sent 2,000 copies of the pocket-sized Baofu Method, each of which is actually sold for 5 yuan, and instructed that after they are sold out, the proceeds will also be donated to subsidize the poor. The two gentlemen are tireless in charity, and we are deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Etiquette and Charity</h3>
<p>Last month, Mr. Liang Shaowen of China Store held a funeral for his wife, Ms. Ouyang. Mr. Liang's relatives and friends appreciated his will and converted all the funeral gifts into cash, donating 213,500 yuan in China Storage Certificates to the First Tuberculosis Hospital of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to fund free anti-tuberculosis work. Ms. Wu Minfang celebrated her 30th birthday, and because it was an extraordinary time, she did not care about extravagance. However, because of the gifts from friends, she felt that it would be disrespectful to refuse. Considering that many poor children are out of school, especially the Lianyi Righteous School is short of funds, she specially allocated all the received gift money, totaling 50,000 yuan in storage coins, to the school's expenses.</p>
<h3>Youth Association Art Exhibition Call for Entries Rules</h3>

<h3>Thunder and Rain (5)</h3>
<p>That might be a human torpedo. Absolutely not. Our Japanese Navy would never adopt such an inhumane and unreasonable method. When Commander Togo blockaded Lushun, the use [of torpedoes] was permitted because the torpedo boats could accommodate crew members. Therefore—</p>
<p>Special Attack Squads are inseparable, clinging tightly to each other. Thus, Takao felt it wasn't right and went to Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada's room.</p>
<p>[Can you paint it? Please tell me the details!]</p>
<p>He simply painted the attack on Pearl Harbor and felt he was letting down the brave warriors of the Special Attack Squad, so he wanted to paint the Special Attack Squad.</p>
<p>[It's not the right time yet.]</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada said crisply, then turned his body and busily operated the switchboard.</p>
<p>Takao listlessly returned to his room.</p>
<p>Soon, 1941, forever etched in Japanese history, passed.</p>
<p>And a new year, brewing with grand hopes, descended.</p>
<p>The New Year's Day was very clear, but bitterly cold. In his apartment, Takao burned glutinous rice cakes sent from his hometown in a brazier and celebrated his twenty-fourth New Year.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he thought of Mahito.</p>
<p>(Where is Mahito eating glutinous rice cakes? Where is he welcoming his twenty-fourth New Year?)</p>
<p>In the same year, from the same hometown, the same south, Mahito, whom he hadn't seen, especially at New Year's, inevitably made him miss him. Moreover, since the Greater East Asia War began, he hadn't even received a postcard. Takao had completely forgotten about his sister's marriage and now only missed his close friend.</p>
<p>The New Year holiday was over, the work day arrived, and he began serving again every day.</p>
<p>Whenever he caught sight of Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada in the corridor, he always wanted to ask:</p>
<p>[Where is Lieutenant Taninaka? Of course, I can't say I want to know the name of the warship, but I just want to know if he is on the front line...]</p>
<p>But this was not allowed to be asked. Knowing things outside one's mission was a violation of naval rules. He couldn't forget that he had failed before when he wanted to paint the Special Attack Squad without orders.</p>
<p>So, Takao could not forget Mahito, yet had to forget him.</p>
<p>Because in late January, he received an order to paint the Battle of Endau, and in mid-February, he received an order to paint the Battle of Bali. These two naval battles, though small in scale in terms of formality, were in essence something our navy could be happy about. The former was a two-on-two gun battle between destroyers, resulting in a major Japanese victory. The opponent was a navy renowned throughout the world. The difference between enemy and our artillery skills was immediately proven by the results. The latter war was where two Japanese destroyers defeated two Dutch cruisers and five destroyers. The destroyer actually ate the cruiser's cat.</p>
<p>Takao felt a thrill in every cell and completed the two naval battle paintings with a cheerful mood. He didn't feel how bad it was. (143)</p>
