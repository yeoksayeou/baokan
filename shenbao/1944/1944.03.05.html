<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>孫中山先生與米</h3>
<p>— 吉田東報</p>
<p>革命成功，我們大家有平米吃」，這一俗話是含有道理的。因為革命成功，實行民生主義，則國民能够吃到眞正賤價的米。（孫中山）</p>
<p>最近米價的飛漲，實在是犯罪的激　。前三四星期，大家都對米二千五百元一担大驚小怪，但今天對於又漲高一倍的米，反不以為怪了。如常此以往，縱或達到一萬元一擔米，也決不會是登峯造極德止境。米價是一切物價的基礎，追隨着米價許廁所的草紙用作貨幣的時代（物物交換時代），是會到來的。這種物價的飛漲，一定會使社會形成「犯罪的潤數」。這就是說，一殺人單　正當收入不能維持生活了，如不為非作歹是不能生存了。假定有一位公司的下級職員，每月薪金一千元，天天只吃大餅油餅。就是薄得風吹即動的大餅，每個也得五元或六元，那末每餐縱然吃五個大餅，一天也非七十五元至九十元不可，一個月就得二千二百五十元至二千七百元。但這是專指獨身者說的。假如該小職員有妻和子，那末專靠正常收入，全家只有坐以待斃。假如他本人和家眷沒有餓斃，那他一定有「勾當」。但這一「勾當」，是按其經濟地位而决定的。他沒有闊老們那樣的經濟力，能認購實業公司的股票，或囤積物品，於是就利用本身的職業，而作最容易犯的「罪惡」。電車公司售票員的揩油，電力公司檢查員的受賄，其主要原因不外乎這種經濟困窘。</p>
<p>這種繼濟困難情形，決不只限於不級聯員。就是中級職員和高級職員，無論正常收入怎樣多，但總趕不上最近米價的飛漲。例如警察局最高幹部幾近一萬元的收入，按現在的米價來說，不過等於二担餘米。至於中級幹部，辛辛苦苦操勞一個月，才只能領到一擔或半擔米，那末怎能維持警察官的最低限度生活呢？這樣看來，現在不能靠正當收入吃飯的現象，日益普遍化了。為了維待生活，地位大者靠大的非法外怏，地位，者辭，的非法外快。在這樣一個社會裏，如「廉潔」，只有餓死。如不改變這樣經濟條件，而只要求他人「廉潔」，這是不通入情的。這並非一概而論，特別是指不能保證最低生活費的下級職員而言的。陳友仁先生會說過：「不吃的生就是死（Life　Without　food　isdeath）」，類為了求生，什麽事情都可以幹得出來。不能保證最低生活，而寧肯「廉潔」待死的聖賢，是不曾多的吧！因此，希望下級職員「廉潔」，起碼必須保證最低限度的生活費才有可能。「衣食足然後知禮儀」，「有恒產則有恒心」之類的話，很簡單明瞭地說明了這一點。</p>
<p>然則中國隊內最低　度的生活費是有麽？試親各國工人生活費中，食對衣住兩項的比例：美國食費佔整個生活費百分之三十八點二，德國佔百分之四十四點三，中國佔百分之五十七點五，印度佔百分之五十九點二。簡言之，凡食費佔生活費之此例大者，就是「能顧吃」的意思。因此，學者稱這一比例為貧困率。按上面列舉的說，中國工人的生活費，差不多一半以上消耗於吃上，這是戰前的統計，然按最近的米價飛漲說，中國的貧困率恐怕接近百分之百了·食糧這個字，在上海就改寫作米，也不算什麽大錯。具體言之，上海只要保證有米吃，期事實上就是保證了每個人的最低生活費。因此歸根結底，間題就在於怎樣保證有米吃。一般人說，保證上海有米吃是不可能的，但我敢武斷地說，並非不可能。孫中山先生會就這一問題，說過如下的話：</p>
<p>「……目前廣州米價高的最大原因，是由於商家擊斷，官吏居人民興政府之間，自肥私囊所致，即有受取佣金之弊所致。如想除去此炸弊害，則工農非合作不可。為使工農瞭解如何合作，則必須宣傳這個道理。現在我國工人，大多數都有相當知識，所以容易宜傳，所困難者，是對農民的宣傳。按農民所產的原價，米一元直接可買二十斤，間接買自商人，一元僅能購十斤。被中間的商人竟賺去一半利益。因此，為實現米價的公平計，則只有工農組織一個合作社。於是工人製造的器具，和農民生產的米就可以直接進行交換。這樣，商人就不能從中取利了，米價就得到最大限度的抑平。」（摘錄自一九二三年十二月三十日，中山先生對中國國民黨黨員所作之演說詞）</p>
<p>中山先生所提倡的這個方法，不能說不適合於現在的上海。假定火柴工塲，紡織工塲之類的個別同業公會，各自組織合作社，然後與農民合作社取得運絡，而於共生要機關內進行相互的生產物交換。於是農民就可獲到價廉的工業生產品，而工塲工人就可買到賤價的食米。自然，最初普遍的進行是不可能的，即部份的開始也無妨。而最近由於客觀環境所迫，上海的各大機關都如爾後春筍似地組織消費合作社了。例如警察局也想組織「警官合作社」，中報館有申報消費合作社等。當然這並不是生產物的交換，而宗旨是在於排除中開榨取者，以保證最低限度的生活。這類組織如在生產企業間發展起來，然後由政府在全國內統一起來，米價問題則自然迎刃而解，同時現在認為不得不為非作歹的罪惡淵藪，也無形消減。認為道樣大的計劃是「說話容易作事難」的人們，或許不少，對於這種人我再引證孫中山先生的下列幾句話，以作本文的結論。</p>
<p>「米價公平，則工農利益增大，為達到這一目的，必須有國體，為使有團體，必須使彼等入黨，入黨後，則聘顧問加以訓練，我們怎樣實行這一方法，實行後，造成如何的國家等等問題，決不是難事，難事山於「不知」，並非「不可能行」。是由於不知「應當怎樣實行」。孟子說過：「挾秦山以超北海，非不行也，不能也。為長者折枝，非不能也，不行也」。假如我們澈底知道了，則不會作不出來，所謂作不出來，並不是挾秦山以超北海那樣的不能，而是為長者折枝那樣的不行。」（魯譯）</p>
<h3>日大本營昨日發表布其頓正面戰果　日軍防衛陣今後異型加強</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電日大本營四日下午三時三十分發表，日軍在在其頓正面於殲滅英印軍第七師團之作戰中，至現在判明所獲之戰果如次：敵棄屍約七千具（內英人約三千），俘　約六百名，鹵獲或毀壞兵器十　加蠱及十五　樓彈砲二十門，高射砲六門，迫擊砲三十四門，速射砲三十門，槍一千九百五十枝，戰車四十五輛，汽車六百六十輛，舟艇十七艘，擊落飛機六十二架，其他兵器彈藥被服等甚多。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　英印軍第七師自於二月四日出動於布其頓方面，未及三旬，即被日軍包圍於馬猶山派東麗辛澤瓦盆地，而遭潰滅。日故阿拉坎第二悲劇又吿出演，日軍所獲煊赫戰果，已由日大本營於四日下午發表。日軍此次作戰之成功，由於發表之具體數字，即可得知，敵軍此役損失，已查明者僅遺屍即約七千具，內中英人不少亦有三千，如連同俘虜六百人計算，則敵軍之兵員損失，當達八千之譜，敵之傷亡實重，故戰前擁約萬餘衆之敵第七師，經此役後，誠可謂其已盡被殲滅矣。又以日軍所鹵獲或毀壤之敵兵器而觀，敵軍之全部裝備巳被毀矣，此次辛澤瓦之殲滅戰如何成功，當可想而知也。然日軍並不以此認為滿足，為期將英印第七師澈底覆滅，仍在繼續掃蕩殘敵中，故日軍戰果今後將更見增大也。又是役戰果中，含有協力日軍之開度國民軍所獲者在內。</p>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據新德里電，東南亞反軸心軍司令部曾於三日發表阿拉坎綫戰况稱：西阿土民軍刻正在加拉當河作戰中，於阿瓦烏卡西北方遭受日軍强壓。</p>
<p>辛澤瓦盆地英主力潰滅</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　據緬甸前錢日軍某甚地電，英軍第七師前呼應英第五師攻擊孟多方面，即在布其頓全綫展開推進作戰，並狂呼奪回日溪，日軍即於本月四日下午二時，對敵展開突破作戰，僅二十日已使辛澤瓦盆地之敵主力潰減，日軍之擊減作戰至此大致告終前，仍繼續掃蕩殘敵，英軍於此再演阿拉坎悲劇之第二幕。客春英軍於阿拉坎戰敗後，仍企圖自印緬國境之西部戰綫實行反擊，俾據點進攻。或向前推進航空基地，日軍則實行電擊作戰，對敵加以包抄，於頓古巴札，那喀恩及辛澤瓦盆地西方三地點切斷英軍退路，完成包圍網，而將敵主力殲滅。敵軍於事前雖極慎重，對此電擊作戰亦有茫然自大之感，敵一旅國之大部隊，僅遭日軍二三十名之小部隊追學，即形狼狽不堪，是為此次作戰所初見者。蒙特巴頓曾於舊臘親赴量前綫指導作戰，並激勵前綫部隊，渠竟認日軍在孟多作戰略上之後退，為彼等奪回該地，更對世界宣傳英印方資源地域，對淪方打通輸血路，以遮斷日本本土與南方補給路之麻絡，以上之野心今已完全失收。此種蠢動賞無異自掘墳墓，且渝方亦漸認淸印細戰錢反軸心空軍之危機，對英印車之無能，極表不滿，乃率直承認日軍仍掌糧一戰局主動力。並指日本戰力强大之事實。綠日軍現雖在中南部太平洋邀擊敵美軍之總反攻，猶能於一舉粉碎英軍十月餘之反攻準備，已足證日軍尚保有龐大戰力，因此敵方或亦知僅在怒江及緬甸方面自陸上實行正面攻擊，終無效果，縱英印軍作第三次之反攻，而今距雨期僅有三月，於此乾燥期間內决不能完成作戰準備。再者，日軍防衛陣今後惟有愈形加強，此次作戰僅二十日（前次作　為兩月）鮑斯氏亦統率印度國民軍高揭「打倒英國解放祖國」之旗幟·協同日軍作戰，獨立日度之三色旗，於阿拉坎上空飛舞，攻擊吉大港之態勢已告完成，此對多年在英　制壓下叫吟久思痛擊英人之印度兵，實予以極大反響，最近英印軍中印兵之投降者，層出不窮，故今後戰局動向，頗堪注目。</p>
<h3>日新聞團體發起　國民總崛起大會　定本月六日在東京舉行</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社雷日本朝日新聞·每日新聞·讀賣新聞·東京新聞六日在此間日比谷公堂舉行「國民總蹶起大會」是日將由同盟社長古賀氏摔　大詔，當口論報國會專務理事鹿子木博士致開會辭抑氏任大會主席，日本產業經濟保主筆小河利得氏決議文，其他各報社社長或代表等將作種種之演講</p>
<h3>對緬甸延遲攻勢英美將領起衝突</h3>
<p>日內瓦四日中央社電據比間所獲消息：反軸心東南亞洲總司令蒙特巳頓大將及美駐印軍總司令斯蒂威爾將軍發生嚴重之衝突，蒙特巴頓特使其參謀長維坦雅將軍是美作調人。斯蒂威爾將軍曾指摘蒙氏之不發動奪回緬甸之大攻勢。經坦雅將軍在華盛頓稱：蒙氏因缺乏船舶·故不能不出於　慎行動，因此而阻礙其準備工作，美陸軍部亦同意此項解釋。蒙特巴頓以奪回緬解及馬來兩地為其主要目的，而期蒂威爾以奪回緬甸為發動東亞攻勢之始，因茍能獲得緬甸，則供應品得輸邊至緬，使對日之主要進攻成為可能。</p>
<h3>日陸軍在各地區實行進攻邀擊戰　上月墜毀敵機四〇七架</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日上午十一時三十分發表：帝國陸軍部隊二月中對敵航空部隊賞行進攻及邀擊作戰，所獲之綜合戰果如次：　中國方面擊落三十一架（其中十四架未證實），擊毀十二架，日軍自爆及未歸返者十五架。　緬甸方面擊落七十七架，（內十四架未證實），擊毀四架，日方自爆及未歸返者十架。　新幾內亞方而擊落一百二十五架，（內二十八架未證實），日方自爆及未聲返者九架，地上損害四十六架。　波根維爾島及俾斯麥羣烏擊落一百〇三架（內十一架未證實），擊毀五十五架，於以上各地共擊落擊毀敵機四百〇七架（內六十七架夫證實），日方損害八十架。</p>
<h3>日重光外相宴待外交團</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電日重光外相四日在外相官邸設宴寬帶外交團，主方到日外務省重光外相，松平次官·來柄·石射大使等，賓方到我駐日大使蔡培·德大使史塔瑪·滿國大使王允卿·泰大使華德揚等夫婦，及緬大使戴元•菲大使伐爾加斯等•暨各中立國大使公使夫婦等，情況盛極一時，三時半始散。</p>
<h3>日收容外人　設施滿意　紅會代表報告</h3>
<p>沮利克四日中央社電　及軸心陣覺曾大肆宣傳，日本處待被拘留之外國人。一據伯爾尼來電稱，萬國紅會駐滬代表曾發表，謂視察日收容所之結果，已判明其一切設施，均可令人滿意，舊此反軸心虛僞宣傳實不攻自破。</p>
<h3>滿與農大臣　招待日要人</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電滿洲國興農大臣黃福後，四日下午五時假大束亞會館，設宴招待日各界代表，到靑木大東亞大臣聲本莊繁。南次郎兩大將。酒井忠正伯。石黑忠為氏等九十餘人。席間首由費氏致詞，略謂，「余自抵東京以後，迭承各方予以積極援助與歡迎，實不勝惑激，吾人為完成大東亞戰爭，今後益富奮勉努力，以擊英美。」繼由靑朝野之協力表示感謝，至七時許資主　　而散。</p>

<p>反動心軍二日於　中海戰綫，曾動員空前末有之大空軍兵力，於納吐諸地區投下二十磅之榴散炸彈四萬枚，以此即可規知反軸心軍當局對打開富　謬着之戰局，而惑如何焦慮。</p>
<p>柏林　日中央社電　德　新聞社訊：納吐諸登陸岸頭，二日績有活躍之局部戰事，該處處之主，力仍為德軍所有·該處戰無較大變動發生，但大批德衝鋒軍向阿　里亞－安齊奧公路兩旁之英美軍防地實行猛攻，而終於使德軍戰綫向前推進。齊斯特那之西，美傘兵企圖進攻，雖以强大之榴彈砲為掩護，但給果仍告失敗，在同一地區之更東部，强大之美衝鋒軍一隊被掃減。南義前綫僅有一事值得提，即在亞特里亞地區德衝鋒軍一隊深人英軍陣綫，擊毀英軍子彈庫一所，擒獲英軍戰俘多名，而返歸自己之陣錢。</p>

<h3>檢討必勝生活</h3>
<p>敵軍在馬紹爾羣為登陸的消息傳來，戰事也漸次迪近日本領土來了。但這時候我們部並不慌張，也沒有斗喊的必耍。那麼，我們應該怎樣才好？勝利在那裹？我們如果冷靜地來反省我們的生活，便可發見勝利之路即在身邊，而且誰都可知道的，只要緊緊地抓住這機會，斷然實行卜去而巳。</p>
<p>生活的革新</p>
<p>誰也希望吃精白的米飯，使肚子飽滿，誰也希望旅行，閒逸無事，這也許是人之常情吧。而且聽到孩子們耍吃點心，沒有點心給地，一定會不滿意配給的制度吧，但是趁着這個敵軍來襲馬紹爾島的機會，再來加以想一想吧。假使敵人的野望，及於本士的時候，將要如何？那個時候，吃着白米很覺飽滿的你，或做了快樂的歸省旅行的你，或吃着在擠軋中掙買出來的點心的孩子，不知道將臨到什麼運命呢？敵人公然說着：「白本民族減亡」的不逞口號，我們冷靜地來黑索敵人這不遜的一句話吧，我們可不是應抑制任何慾望而要忍耐痛苦，每個國民，平心靜氣想到那最後的一錢，趁着遭敵軍來襲馬紹爾島的機會，應由衷心拋棄昨日的腐敗的過去生活，那才是為着國家，為着你自己。</p>
<p>這是勝利生活</p>
<p>那末，為着要獲得勝利，應該過着什麽生活？這並不是困難的事情，不，大部份的生活，你們已在經騐着。二月五日河野密氏在衆議院席上，在惑謝勗勉應徵人士詞中有這節：「某一個炭灰坑裏，有一個應徽徵人的太太，看着丈夫的肚子餓，把自己三頓的飯減為二頓，而日吃稀飯，以期丈夫完成採炭的任務。」這一段話使滿塲的人都感動得流淚。像這位夫人的生活，也是勝利的路之一。換言之；對自己的生活，盡了最善的方法，「以殉死的態度與精神「去生活，去工作，無論如何，應抱持不輪洋鬼的壯烈氣魄。我個知道在農村，在工廠，在部落會等等的人，都有着一種的精神，但是有沒有未澈底的，地方？自己想想看，由與「心內的敵」鬥爭，開始新的生活吧，而來建設在二十四小時內，無論從任何地方也找不出間隙的勝利生活吧。除此以外，別無　利的方法。</p>
<p>應改革之處</p>
<p>舉一個例，在軍需工廠，直接從事生產飛機的工員，眞是有榮譽因為生一點小病就不到工廠，或因為收入多而過着遊閑的生活，那麽將如何呢？這便是「美國的同志」了。再如白天向國民高呼「改革生活，排命增產的指導的　客酬　生活，那又將如何？我們霜到塔的到現在的生活，為着國家做事。同時有沒有帶着二分「敵人的同志一之點？別人的生活不必說塔，自已應該反省自己去改革吧。</p>
<p>一萬萬的國民，每個這樣日己反省。便是勝利之路，不必非難他人，敎訓他人，也不必有不平或不滿。應該反省的些級之點，我們已經聽得耳聲了。一節省戰衣服」，「不要竹無用旅行」，「買公債」，一致力儲蓄一…等等這些大家都够知道的，如果想到最惡的塲合，應自明天起，切實寶行遺誰都可以做的事情。　　前進才是勝利</p>
<p>也許有人這麼想：「好，幹吧·可是現在的配給到底可以嗎？」「那種的價格·能够增產嗎？」「海員在北千島，，與嚴寒戰爭，脚着報紙和破布，默默地從事戰事，對這不能改養嗎？」這許多的問題，於一月二十一日必勝議會席上，代議士巳把這些問題全盤托出質問政府，這天詳細聽到問答的人，這樣感到：「常局也很直率地容納國民的呼聲，而披瀝所信了。」於是一萬萬國民的代表議員和政府，已經達到解次點了。</p>
<p>勝利就在目前</p>
<p>敵軍來製馬給爾島了：我們非革新生活不可。這時候是很重要的時機，不必無故担憂，也不必悲觀。敎人誇獎飛機數置多，去年十二月一個月·也不過生產九干架而已而且這些飛戰，要分配在歐洲及生產，由一萬萬的國民的努力，不久也可實現多量的生產。</p>
<p>節省瓦期及電力，貢獻生產。收回金屬，買獻資源。應徽以期曾產資源與石炭中不作無為的旅行或囤積貨件，以增加輸運力量。勞務管理未完備之的，不分男女，一致對國家貢戲勞働力，那麽，敵人的大量生產，亦不足恐。只有决　，努力。人不求我之前，我們應先貢獻。若能够忍受一年兩年的刻苦生活，有閉目忍耐的氣概，那麽勝利就在目前。日本有着世界無四的國體，前綫父有誇耀世界的陸海將兵，听以後方的一萬萬國民，從此應澈底實施一戰爭的生活！」（弘譯自二月七日朝日新聞（</p>

<h3>實施燈火營制　孫理氏談話　深盼切實覆行以竟全功</h3>
<p>上海特別市市民防空本部總務處長孫理甫氏，為此次實施燈火管制，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>具有深刻意義</p>
<p>昨為三月三日，上海益巳進入次戰階段，按照上海陸海軍防空司令部本月一日第二十一號佈告，自本月三日起，每日自日落時起至翌晨日出時止，在上海特別市政府管轄之全境內，實施燈火管制。</p>
<p>查燈火管制，過去在上海業經舉行若干次，已為市民所深知，尤以在本年一月九日中國參戰一週年紀念日，定為「防空日」以後，燈火管制事宜，成為防空訓練之一重要都份，認質實施。惟此次次定實施之燈火管制，為適應戰時之燈火管制，且具有半永久之性質，與向所舉行者，根本不同，此節應請市民深切了解。</p>
<p>過去之訓練燈火管制，不過在指定之某日某時舉行，為時至為短促，即以極為簡單之熄燈辦法將就敷衍，以期塞責。此次賞施之燈火管制則不然，具有更深刻之意義，應每日當施管制，非僅在短時間舉行而巳，換言之，應視回半永久性質之事務，作為市民日常生活之一重要部份，予以實施，至中日兩國　　作職之大東亞戰學，取得最後勝相為止。</p>
<p>努力防術天空</p>
<p>自中日兩國互相提携，站在生死關頭，以與英美宣戰以來，為時巳逾一年有二月。宣戰伊始，上海處在戰事範園之內，早已顯見有隨時遭受敵機空　之危險，然上海市民殆與平時無異，度績過其通常之生活，以為燈火管制事宜，如訓練時所舉行者，至多每月一次，即可了事，此誠匪夷所思，不可為訓。蓋如今實施戰時燈火管制，有已　過遲之感。</p>
<p>無論如何，現在作戰區域，距離上海並不甚遙，上海亦為戰塲，且在班之突國空軍，以舉行最大之空襲擾亂和平地區為自標，虎視耽耽，待機而動，上海之將成最主要臘塲之一，甚為昭著，不雷而喻。</p>
<p>現在歐洲之戰，與大東亞之戰，皆為民族爭取生存之戰爭，而中日共同作戰之大東亞戰爭，尤有其特殊目的，即將百年以來英美荷蘭登國侵略達東政策，根本排除，使解放之大東亞諸民族團給一致，以建設大東亞為理想，而謀東洋各民族獨立之戰爭。</p>
<p>為謀東洋各民族之獨立，以建設解放之大東亞為最高之理想而戰，我國又起而與日本提携，在汪主席領導之下，向完成戰爭之大道邁進，故上海今日，即使成發　主要戰場，但因中圖市民，眞有堅毅次心，故絲毫不受影響，吾輩市民，對於料必來臨而業巳臨頭之事，祗得以不　忙不發擾之態度，在上海睦海軍防空司令部及上海特別市市民防空本部賢明指導之下，努力向防衛大上海天空之途前進。</p>
<p>希望市民協力</p>
<p>敵方美國，自　珠灣敗北以來，屢戰屢敗，至今始由其初戰慘敗之狀况，逐漸恢復，唯恃其擾勝世界之物力賢源，狂呼太平洋總反攻之口號，以中部與西南部太平洋為主力戰塲，重演其屍山血海之大激職，盟邦日本之精親陸海軍部隊，不畏強　，與敵周旋，一　之日本國民咸抱「奮鬥到底」之决心，雖現時　局進退靡定，而我東亞民族對於最後勝利，則深信無疑，惟美國一面狂呼太平洋德反攻，一面力國增强其在華空軍，並　際襲擊日本及和平地帶內各重要都市。</p>
<p>此次燈火管制，即係鑒於在華美空軍之蠢動狀態而施行，為保衛隨時有遭受空發危險之大上海，與保障五百萬市民生命財產之安全起見，此為事屬必要之舉。我輩市民參加此舉，實即保衛自己之生命財產，大上海市中，偶一不慎，洩漏一綫燈光，即成為空襲轟炸機之良好目標，而使全市陷於烈燄之中。切望全體市民，能充分了解大東亞戰爭下之上海地位，與燈火管制在防空上之重要意義，對於此次管制，極力誠意合作，以獲得良好之成續。</p>
<p>上海睦海軍防空司令部，鑒於戰略上之　係，尤其緊次主張，認眞實施燈火管制。防空本部為協力完成上海之防衛起見，對於違犯之人，當從嚴憊罰，務希市民均能了解，協力合作。</p>
<p>保持夜間工作</p>
<p>茲將市民一體當施燈火管制時不易明際之點，說明如下：一般住屋在燈火管制時應以將所有之窗（包括天窗在內），用黑布及百葉窗等遮蔽為原則，惟室內電燈，如在二十支光以下，蓋有二十度以上角度之黑色燈軍，且屋頂上不致反射光錢者，可不必特用黑布百葉窗等遮蔽，就此點而論，此次電火管制，司謂比過去訓練時所舉行者，大為寬容。</p>
<p>然大東亞戰爭已進人次戰階段，在華之美國空軍復蠢動無已，上海市民亟須極力事備燈火管制之材料，俾在無論何時，能由現時之預備管制，轉入眞正之空襲管制。市民購買新布料代價殊昂，故須畫量利用廢物，雖在燈火管制之下，仍須增强生產，並保持其他必要之夜問工作，毋使遭受妨碍，本過去訓練所得之經騐，努力從事。</p>
<p>市民因燈火管制咸受種種不便，自在意料之中，然此為後方民衆確保自己生命財產，力圖戰事勝利起見，所應取之自衛手段，縱惑不便，無足介意，深望發憤努力，寶行管制，以竟全功，是為至禱。</p>
<h3>規模最大的　難童敎養機關——上海難童敎養院——</h3>
<p>從三路電車的底站麥根路至武定路，踏上黑色的細砂馬路——麥特赫司脫路，不到二百步，在左側的壁上赫然顯露籃地白字：「上海難童敎養院」。走進方記倉庫，推開右側的大門，就是寬關朗爽的校園。包含着三十五幢洋房的軒昂新型的難童院舍，　峙在眼前了。</p>
<p>創辦到發展</p>
<p>豪邁魁梧的中年人陸衆恩先生——上海難童激養院總幹事，在殷動的寒暄之後，談起這個全滬規模最大的難童敎養機關，在萬方多難中誕生的一段故事。</p>
<p>是民國二十七年，上海到處充滿了流浪無告的難民子女，但是收容敎查者却是寥落無幾。五月間，首有李如璋等籌備創辦，至入月十五日，「上海救濟難民兒童敎　養院」，在金神父路樂善寺內宣告成立，明白規定其宗旨為「收容家境困難無力撫養之難童」，那時由於經費，人材和院址伶方面種種限制，所收容的難童，總計不過二十七人。半年以後，由陸文　氏繼任務，並以各界日漸與院務，並以各界日漸認識該院之事業，一時無告的難童，如萬流歸壑一般，　流而至，收容人數，增達三百零六人。二十八年已經設法租得武定路二五入弄九九號現址，自建院舍樓房廿七幢，平房十間，規模漸臻完備。陸衆恩先生說着，特別引導去觀看院舍的建築，值得注意的是該院的廁所，具有地下化糞設施，沒有普通廁所不可密邇的臭味，在全滬慈善機關中是很少看得到的。當時由某建築公司捐建，所費也有十多萬呢！</p>
<p>到了三十年三月，高懷良氏繼任該院院畏，憑著他的幹練，進一步整頓院務，發展敎養？事葉，添建新院舍八幢。近來並為便利出入計，與方記倉庫商妥，借得麥特赫司脫路六〇一號開為該院大門，更在形式上顯得堂島莊嚴的難童學府·在規模方面，不失其「上海第一」，的地位了。</p>
<p>生活紀律化</p>
<p>上海難童激養院現收在容的男女難童共達二百五十四人，養，管，敎三者，都由院方分派惠員負責，在際裘設有養務處和敎務處二部，主持其事。</p>
<p>養的方面，主要任務是注意全院院生體格的健全。初進激養院的難意，不少是癲痢頭，痧眼，以及皮膚病如疥療等等，首先得加以療治，否則就會傳染蔓延。他們在去年曾經施行澈底的隔隔治療，目前大部分已經告痊，還有少數仍與健康的學生隔隔。</p>
<p>為着保障孩子們經常的健康狀態，院裹特設有醫療室，二樓，朗爽的一列房間，一般疾病的診室，眼耳咽喉科診室，手術室等等，一切治療設備，已可說是應有盡有了。緊靠着診療室設的是藥劑室。幾座藥櫥中，却也盈盈然羅列各種西藥。據說，這還是從前購辦的，現在尚可敷用，不逼孩子們的疾病究以皮膚及外科為多，因此如油膏，紗布，藥棉等外科用藥品感到不足，醫師每大來曉檢診的，他們多數以犧牲服務精神，不收任何酬報。在院裹，也有專司醫藥方面事務的議士。</p>
<p>除了醫療之外，要被注意的是院生日常生活的淸潔衛生，合理的作息時間，廁所是特殊的蹲式構造，以免一般坐式之易於傳染皮膚疾病。洗浴在夏季是强迫每天或隔天一次，入秋以來，已改為每星期一次。浴室在親定時間分級分組使用之後，立即閉鎖，以免孩子們浪費水量，並可保持浴室的淸潔。院生的衣服，也規定時問洗　，所以雖然粗布制服，却都整齊淸潔，疾病也自然滅少了。</p>
<p>每天講書與工作之暇，孩子們都有一定的游戲及運動的時問，校園還像是新開闢的樣子，很廣，是極好的運動塲所。如果能够添辦些運動設備和用品，難童學生們的生活必然更將顯得有意義吧！</p>
<p>由於經費關係，院裏的伙食是相常淸苦的。　父一律吃三頓粥，全要依靠戶口來粉，自己添購些補充，也約略備一些蔬菜。看吧，廚房裹正煮着三火鍋粥，揭開衆蓋，熱氣昇騰，看不淸是什麽質料，地上的幾大桶已煮就的，呈現焦黃色的濃粥，還冒出一些香味。櫃裏堆積些白菜，算是唯一的菜肴。</p>
<p>臥室裹一律陳列着雙層的鐵床，墊子上鋪列着一色雪白的被單，男生，女生，敎職員，完全相同。在起床後一律閉鎖，非到就　時或有特別事故不准私入，因此也保特才分整潔。秋己深，但院生們床上還沒有被頭，據陸先生說，要到冬季再發給。</p>
<p>生活在集體的紀律化中，但一即是為了學生們的利益，在紀律中充滿着慈愛。</p>
<p>敎育新方法</p>
<p>難童敎發院裏的養，是替苦難兒童創造了一個大家庭。裏面的職員。成為兒童們的母姊和保姆。但是，孩子們還需而要精神上的食糧，智識上的啓發和道德上的訓練，因此，難童敎養院又成為一座學府。</p>
<p>敎務處是上海難童敎養院敎育工作的最高領導組織，包括那女敎員十五位，分工合作，進行敎導事務，將二百數十名難童編為六級，構成普通完全小學的編制，原定一年分兩學期，與普通小學一致。不過在實施中發覺寒署假期內，學生們不能正常上課，嬉游無事，浪費光陰，殊屬可惜，在激育原則上也不合理。所以從去年起，取消假期，改定每年分為三學期。這樣學生修業年限，實際上司以維短，普通學校六年可以修畢的完全小學學業，現在只須四年即可。如果更在課業方面再加以必要的調整，勿作填鴨式的敎育，使塲學童能够不惑到課業之過分繁重，使能充分吸納消化與活用其所學，那麼，不僅在難童敎育為值得模仿的新辦法，即在普通敎育上也有研究的必要吧。</p>
<p>整齊的一列院舍，分佈着各級敎室，從走廊方柱上的標語，到課室門口及室內牆上的表格與褂圖，都表現出一般辦得最有精神的學校的特色。正是大考的時間，每一各課室裹整齊地坐着的孩子們，全神注視着油印的試卷，有的在　筆疾書，在的還在側首凝思，敎師們可也不得暇，有的在低聲地解答各別的疑問，有的在注視學生的行動。</p>
<p>居然有初中一初中二的敎室，也有年齡較大的學生在上課。陸先生說，本來，院生在高級小學畢葉後，使其投考相當的中學，一切費用完全由曉方負擔，無形中成為學生的「再生父母」，後來因為實際上的需要與可能，就從上學期起，自辦初中，使院生畢業於完全小學之後，仍可在本院繼體求學·不過，為求將來升學及捕班的便利起見，該院所綢配的課程項目，以及所採用的敎科書，以及每天授課的時間，完全與普通學校！合，完全為曉生的將來出路打算，也是非常難得的。</p>
<p>學科敎育之外，對於曉生日常生活，人格修養，以及團體生活，也相當注重，由各敎員分負訓育的責任，使德育，體育，羣育與智育平均發展。使每一個院童，成為未來中國健全的國民。據說，該院第一二屆畢學生九名，全部考取申新兩報助學及貸學金，其中最優秀生五名，並經考取叔頻公獎學金，目前六人均已謀得職業，其餘三人則仍裔　業於本市三才中學，從這裹也可看出該院激育成績一斑吧。</p>
<p>工藝與勞動</p>
<p>為着適應難童的特殊需要，上海難童敎養院也如別的難童敎養機關一樣，在普通學科敎育之外，兼授工藝技術，使這班窮孩子在院學得相富工作技術，將來如無月升學，就可出而謀生自立，並為社會服務。不過，和別的激養機關不同者，就在並不實行完全的半工半讀制，而是一讀主工從」制，讀書的時間，完全與普通學校相同，次不抽出來做工。只在學科時間以外，規定若干時間，使學習工藝，這種辦法，自亦有其愛護難童的苦心。</p>
<p>工藝激有方面，生要的是縫級科和織機科，只授女生。緊接箔課室，一間縫級室裏，陳列　幾榮縫級機，旁邊一間，陳列着兩排搖襪機。每天晚上，是她們激學工藝的時間。據說成績還相當良好，其出品現在巳可供給院內需用，將來達到了「自給」程度之後，也許還可以為社會服務咧。</p>
<p>男生的工藝敎育，似乎還沒有正常的展開，現在院內組織有一隊音樂隊，挑選一部分具有音樂天才的兒童，加以特殊的普樂激育，樂隊的學識和規律。現在已經訓練完成，並且已經接受各界的要求，參加婚喪喜慶及各種儀式，頗為各方所讚美，而且還有一部分收入，可充該院一部分補助。</p>
<p>上海難童敎養院為了養成院生自助助人的習慣，為了加强院生實際生活敎育的效率，對於院內一切事務，概以學至自動處理為原則，所以二三百人的一個大機關，只雇用院役二人，以為指導及輔助者，所有全院的淸潔工作，洗衣，整理，佈置，搬移，以及其他日常生活中的勞動事務，完全由激職員指導學生自己負擔起來。務求處理得有條有理。全院各部分莫不給人以整齊淸潔和藝術化的印象，就可看出苦難兒童的自治與自助能力。　然，激職負在組織與指導方而所費的心血，一定也不少啊！</p>
<p>「大家都有工做，人人都有飯吃」，中山先生的政治理想，在上海難童激養院中總算在實現了。</p>
<p>完善的組織</p>
<p>這個規模宏大的難童敎養院的最高組織是董事會，由董事會推選院長，總攬全院行政，現任院長為高懷良先生。院長之下特設總幹事（現任為陸衆恩先生）及秘書各一人，協助院長襄理及規劃全院行政，並督促全院之各種工作，以上董事院長總幹事及秘書，均願為難童激養事業而犧牲服務，不受任何酬勞或薪津。</p>
<p>全院事務，由事務處主持，與敎育處養務處並列。包括職員六人，每人酌予薪給自一百二十元至一百五十元，全月共祗七百五十元，實際上完全是犧牲服務。事務工作分列五股：會計股，計有會計·出納·徵收各一人，會計員負責編製帳冊與密核各種單據能事，出納員負責現金出入事宜，但一切款項之支出必須經總幹事核准並簽字。　收員則負責徵收任何捐款事宜。</p>
<p>文書股只有職員一人，除了負責日常對外公牘之　擬以外，平時尚須紀錄院務日誌，以供日後查考。登記股亦設職員一人，專理院生入院出院之登記事項，並負責關查院生家屬之詳細狀况。</p>
<p>此外尚有採辦和保管兩股。前者辦理全院需用物品之採辦，不另設專員，現由各股合議辦理之。購入的物品，均轉入後者——保管股，該股設有職員一人，几院內人員須用任何物品，均須負責　　領物單，由該股核准發給。全曉學生衣物等件，編列號碼，按級分藏在一列列的大櫃中，由級任敎師負責保管。</p>
<p>敎務處的敎員十五人，每月薪給自一百八十元至三百二士元，合計也不過二千八百琴五元。激師的生活本來在今日為殺淸苦的，該院敎職員的最高月薪而言，也只有三百二十元，較普通學校，不見得好些。然而，在工作方面，因為實行一年三學期制，終年沒有休假，其辛勤自然更加可佩。</p>
<p>上海難童敎養院所有工作人員，都在「分工合作」原則之卜服務，由於組織的完善，精神的健全，無怪在難重敎養事勞方面能够占有相富的地位了。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>穿着夏天的軍服，掛　短劍，在故鄉的街上搖擺着，也不過是回鄉到故鄉的第一天，一日的工夫，那也是為參幷東鄉元帥的墓地，八　　社，同祖先的墳墓。</p>
<p>「為什麼不穿軍服呢？」到姐姐家去和拜　伯父家庭的時侯，都受到同樣的質問，他只有微笑着。</p>
<p>說老誠話，他自己也說不出是甚麼理由，在他自己總感覺着害羞似的。要說是客氣的話，也許對在四年生時，軍人班同志們的客氣。他們不是還留在二中的五年級麽——</p>
<p>「顏色也黑了，身體也胖了要使人認幣錯了。</p>
<p>拜訪緒方家庭的時候也是穿着二中時代的　降色的　服，　　來　　　先生　　人的服裝，好像沒　　似的　間時先生也是　　是在放儼期聞，所以撤着雄　。「一定要穿章服給我看看——」</p>
<p>唯有　夫是不應許的。「一定要穿章服給我　看——」</p>
<p>他上到那到那酷暑的屋頂眞人的屋子裏，強逼着償人·並且像眞人初人學的時侯似的，將短　拔出看着，並且　觀着帶着舖型的　章等。　夫終於強迫價人，要借他的　服自己穿　翟看。</p>
<p>「很像啊！帶着眼鎭，好像軍醫官似的」。</p>
<p>看到　夫穿軍服的姿式，眞人這樣的　　　，崁夫却很正經的說着：「在這樣的軍帽上，再　上兩這白錢，就可以了……。」</p>
<p>帶白餞的、是海軍種理學校學生的軍帽。並口那麼校的體格　說，也就在十日之內的。眞人邊嬉　地美着回想起去年的今日。</p>
<p>穿定以後隆夫開口說道：</p>
<p>「我看見海軍的夏服，就要想起那個軍官來，——</p>
<p>「誰啊？」</p>
<p>「到江田島參觀去的時候，訓話的敎官：」</p>
<p>「啊，那個敎官……」</p>
<p>眞人對那銘感五內的訓話的主人，也是不會忘掉的。從入學以後，就詳細的觀察敎官的容顔，但是總也沒波見的。兵學校是潮氣未退，就要更換敎官的，敎官的任期是極短的。「潮氣未退——」。</p>
<p>隆夫搖着頭深深的惑動着。</p>
<p>（　）</p>
<p>時常聽到上級的學生說，若是回家去的時候，一定要感到時間太長無聊得很的。現在一看果然是不錯的，不由地回想起那迎一分一秒的時間都要活用着的江田烏生活。</p>
<p>「媽，我送米去吧。」眞人有一天這樣地向母親提起來了。</p>
<p>「用不着，不工作也可以，」母親這樣的說者。</p>
<p>「因為是放假回家來的，也可以休息　的；」</p>
<p>四吉兄也在旁邊挿帶了嘴。</p>
<p>但是眞人是不肯的。穿着白色的　衫二中時代的霜降色的褲子，到櫃台上來了。）</p>
<p>「若是自已　意做的話，就做吧。」這樣一來，母親也不能強迫禁止的。</p>
<p>眞人聽哥哥說的主顧家　將裝一斗的米口袋三個，捆在脚踏車的貨架上，前着頹廢，穿着粗布衣服，一見確好像米店的小夥計似的。</p>
<p>「我要去了。」跳上腳蹬車的姿勢，四吉兄在後邊看着發笑。</p>
<p>主顧之中兩處，都是不相識的，所以倒很坦然的，但是最後一家，終於被發覺了。</p>
<p>「眞人君，　作了海軍的學生，還串來送米啊」。</p>
<p>「是的」。俱人紅　笑顏，也沒有甚麼改變的樣，向客人素來印戳子打在貨單上。</p>
<p>貨都送空了，所以車子很輕快的，很快活的在二中附近的大街上飛跑着，從後邊大聲的喊着：「喂！谷君！」</p>
<p>眞人輕輕地將車子停在路旁上，在那裏船着白上身聲着黑禮服裙子的小森在道旁上站着。他也是因為陸軍士官學校休假，而歸省回來的。</p>
<p>「好久沒見了，你多　回來的？」</p>
<p>因為對方也是軍人，所以眞人也不客氣地說着。小森也是相同的也是不客氣的。並日互相在心中都感到自己是軍人的一種矜持。</p>
<p>「現在我正想到你家去——二中的軍人班的同學們預定以你我和熊澤三人為中心，明天晚上在河邊上的小菜館吃鍋子。所以我要去告訴你　。」小森很得意地這樣說着。</p>
<p>國民論壇</p>
<h3>米糧增產的檢討</h3>
<p>— 王大菜</p>
<p>關於米糧的增產，可分為開源，節流，和調劑三方面來共求進展。</p>
<p>開源方面：</p>
<p>子，荒地的墾植我國地廣人衆，可資利用的是極多；尤其是在華北及蘇北一帶，荒地的面積是甚為可觀。據統計的結果，華北方面目前的種植面積已增加了一二九一二〇〇畝，華北方面，亦已增多了原有面積的白之三十。這當然是由於政府的注意墾植，但是人民的需要還是未足，還是布望政府能更進一步的注意貇植。</p>
<p>丑，原有土地的曾產　在過去的事實告訴我們，，農作物的損傷是如何的重大。即以去年汀南一帶而論，死於赤銹病的大豆與被水吞沒的稻禾，據吳縣一縣的統計，要在五十萬萬以上。這數目是如何的使人驚奇，因而使我們不得不注重到農作物的增產上去。農作物的增產，可分兩面來講，積極的是當倣效日本的集約農制。用各種的科學方法，使物盡其利，使這土地上能產生出極大的收穫量。當然這所謂種種科學方法內是包含着種種，如肥料方面，種子方面，儲藏方面等，對於種子的改良，當注意到下列各點，A新種的育成。B穀種的交換。C穀種的檢選。D穀種的貯　。二消極的即當對水利講究對虫蟲撲滅。水旱的調節，蝗螟等的預防，尤其是件刻不容緩的事。</p>
<p>節流發那個面：</p>
<p>子，菜館用米的限制我們寗可使全上海的菜館沒有飯賣，而不願使之仕意浪費。主張在菜館之外另設專門售飯的飯館，如有這天剩餘的話，就得移之明日，而不願使之任意的浪費。</p>
<p>丑，釀酒的禁止在米糧缺乏的今日，單以充肌一項的用途來說已是不够分配；但在畸形的事業發展上看來，　酒業仍是不衰；所以說為了戰時體制的適應，我們應　對的禁止釀酒，而維持人民的生命國家的生良。</p>
<p>調劑方面：</p>
<p>甲，限制米糧的私自賣買並增多戶口米之配給。杜米的私自賣買，因而造成了米價的黑市；於是一般農民，貪圖着黑市的　價可售而拒絕收買，而影響的米紛統制會的無法收買食米。所以在米糧私自　買的禁止，無異可使戶口米的增多，關了一條捷徑。</p>
<p>乙，配給機構的力求開單，居民依服居住地城各自組織合作社。配給機構的力求簡單，並不一定就是失去其機密性，乃是在求共速度的增加，此外多少可減去其中一點流弊；以往的經騐告訴我們，零售商的從中作弊，時亦有之；所以我現在主張在上海的居民，各自依據住址，並依照了保甲組織，或一保或一聯保各自組成消費合作社，（奮假名其名稱為第　區第　聯保（保）消費合作社）以每一住民為社員，然後政府即依據了社員的多　而配給米糧以及其他日用品。此外連帶的一點，就是需做到　目公開的一點，否則就無異於變相的糧食店</p>
<p>丙，米糧的調查和統計　要解決目前的民良間題，當先解決生產問題，前而已經述及。其次的即為分配問題；然我國的糧食生產額究屬有多少，為今日計當亟先從事實地的調查，遇有糧食不足的省縣，一方面加以增加生產的方法，一方面酌盈劑虛再製成統計供專家的研究</p>
<p>丁，各級倉儲之整理</p>
<p>古人云「三年之耕餘一年之積，九年之作有三年之儲；雖水旱為災，而人一無菜色一。於此巳可知積毅的重要。為目今計，為將來計，當對各省縣鄕　設立的倉庫更求其成效。</p>
<p>，糧食　的國營在目今戰爭狀態之下，食糧的價格當然是必會暴漲；政府為免除人民苦痛起見，可設立「糧食補助金」使米糧價格低平，而以此基金償諸廠主之損失。這是暫時壓平米糧價格的辦法，此外並由政府收購食糧；這點是已有米紛統制會的組織，但更憲有國營糧食的　之設立，或即以此糧食廠而直接配給於各新祖合作社；一方面可平靜市價，一方面可統制全國米糊充混他種成分，以製造食料。</p>
<p>上面的所述各點，右從點是國府正在進行的或是將來預備進行的，其他的各項，則有待於當局的統　籌劃，以及朝野一體的擁戰庶可克收宏效。</p>

<h3>Mr. Sun Yat-sen and Rice</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toho Report</p>
<p>"After the revolution succeeds, we will all have affordable rice," this common saying contains truth. Because after the revolution succeeds and the Principle of People's Livelihood is implemented, the people will be able to eat truly cheap rice. (Sun Yat-sen)</p>
<p>The recent soaring rice prices are truly a crime being instigated. Three or four weeks ago, everyone was shocked by the price of 2,500 yuan per dan (unit of weight) of rice, but today, they no longer find it strange that the price has doubled again. If this continues, even reaching 10,000 yuan per dan of rice will not be the ultimate limit. The price of rice is the foundation of all commodity prices. Following the price of rice, an era where toilet paper is used as currency (the barter era) will arrive. This kind of soaring price will definitely cause society to form a "criminal calculus." That is to say, one cannot maintain a life with just legitimate income, and one cannot survive without doing evil. Suppose there is a junior company employee with a monthly salary of 1,000 yuan, who eats only large pancakes and fried dough sticks every day. Even the thinnest pancakes, which can be blown away by the wind, cost five or six yuan each. Then, even if he eats five pancakes per meal, it will still cost 75 to 90 yuan a day, which amounts to 2,250 to 2,700 yuan a month. But this is only for single people. If that junior employee has a wife and children, then relying solely on normal income, the whole family can only sit and wait for death. If he and his family have not starved to death, then he must have some "hanky-panky." But this "hanky-panky" is determined by his economic status. He does not have the economic power of wealthy people to subscribe to shares of industrial companies or hoard goods, so he uses his profession to commit the easiest "crimes." The oil skimming of tram conductors and the bribery of electricity company inspectors are mainly due to this kind of economic difficulty.</p>
<p>This kind of economic difficulty is by no means limited to junior employees. Even middle-level and senior employees, no matter how much normal income they have, cannot keep up with the recent soaring rice prices. For example, the highest-ranking cadres of the police bureau have an income of nearly 10,000 yuan, but at the current price of rice, it is only equivalent to more than two dan of rice. As for middle-level cadres, they work hard for a month and can only get one dan or half a dan of rice. How can they maintain the minimum standard of living for a police officer? From this point of view, the phenomenon of not being able to eat on legitimate income is becoming increasingly widespread. In order to maintain life, those in higher positions rely on large illegal income, and those in lower positions rely on small illegal income. In such a society, "integrity" only leads to starvation. If such economic conditions are not changed, but only asking others to be "honest," it is unreasonable. This is not a generalization, but specifically refers to lower-level employees who cannot guarantee the minimum cost of living. Mr. Chen Youren once said: "Life without food is death." In order to survive, anything can be done. There are probably not many saints who would rather be "honest" and wait for death without guaranteeing the minimum standard of living! Therefore, to hope that lower-level employees are "honest," it is necessary to guarantee at least the minimum cost of living. Words like "When clothing and food are sufficient, then one knows etiquette" and "With constant property, one has a constant heart" simply and clearly illustrate this point.</p>
<p>Then, what is the minimum cost of living in China? Let's look at the proportion of food to clothing and housing in the cost of living for workers in various countries: In the United States, food costs account for 38.2% of the entire cost of living, in Germany, it accounts for 44.3%, in China, it accounts for 57.5%, and in India, it accounts for 59.2%. In short, the larger the proportion of food costs in the cost of living, the more it means "able to take care of eating." Therefore, scholars call this ratio the poverty rate. According to the figures listed above, more than half of the cost of living for Chinese workers is spent on food. This is a pre-war statistic, but according to the recent soaring rice prices, China's poverty rate is probably close to 100%. It wouldn't be a big mistake to rewrite the word "food" in Shanghai as "rice." Specifically, as long as Shanghai guarantees that there is rice to eat, it is actually guaranteeing the minimum cost of living for everyone. Therefore, in the final analysis, the question is how to guarantee that there is rice to eat. Some people say that guaranteeing rice for Shanghai is impossible, but I dare to say categorically that it is not impossible. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said the following about this issue:</p>
<p>"...The biggest reason for the high price of rice in Guangzhou at present is due to merchants' monopolies and officials dwelling between the people and the government, enriching their own pockets, that is, the harm of accepting commissions. If you want to remove this harm, then workers and farmers must cooperate. In order to make workers and farmers understand how to cooperate, it is necessary to publicize this principle. Now most of the workers in our country have considerable knowledge, so it is easy to publicize. The difficulty lies in publicizing to farmers. According to the original price produced by farmers, one yuan can directly buy 20 catties of rice. Buying from merchants indirectly, one yuan can only buy 10 catties. The middlemen merchants earn half of the profit. Therefore, in order to achieve fair rice prices, there is only one way: workers and farmers organize a cooperative. Then the tools manufactured by workers and the rice produced by farmers can be directly exchanged. In this way, merchants will not be able to profit from it, and the price of rice will be suppressed to the maximum extent." (Excerpt from a speech given by Mr. Zhongshan to members of the Chinese Kuomintang on December 30, 1923)</p>
<p>The method advocated by Mr. Zhongshan cannot be said to be unsuitable for present-day Shanghai. Suppose that individual trade associations such as match factories and textile factories each organize cooperatives, and then establish contact with farmer cooperatives, and carry out mutual exchange of products within the common livelihood organs. Then farmers can obtain cheap industrial products, and factory workers can buy cheap rice. Naturally, it is impossible to carry out universally at first, and it is okay to start partially. Recently, due to the pressure of objective circumstances, major institutions in Shanghai have been organizing consumer cooperatives like bamboo shoots after the rain. For example, the police bureau also wants to organize a "police officers' cooperative," and the *Shen Bao* newspaper has the *Shen Bao* consumer cooperative, etc. Of course, this is not the exchange of products, but the purpose is to eliminate middle squeezers and guarantee the minimum standard of living. If these types of organizations develop among production enterprises, and then the government unifies them nationwide, the rice price problem will naturally be easily solved, and at the same time, the source of crimes that are now considered inevitable will be invisibly reduced. There may be many people who think that such a big plan is "easier said than done." For these people, I will quote the following words of Mr. Sun Yat-sen again as the conclusion of this article.</p>
<p>"If the price of rice is fair, the interests of workers and farmers will increase. To achieve this goal, there must be a group. To make a group, they must be made to join the party. After joining the party, consultants should be hired to train them. How we implement this method, what kind of country is created after implementation, etc., are not difficult matters. The difficulty lies in 'not knowing,' not 'impossible to do.' It is because of not knowing 'how to implement it.' Mencius said: 'To carry Mount Tai to leap over the North Sea is not that it cannot be done, but that it is not possible. To break a branch for an elder is not that it is impossible to do, but that it is not done.' If we thoroughly understand, then we won't not be able to do it. The so-called not being able to do it is not like carrying Mount Tai to leap over the North Sea, which is impossible, but like breaking a branch for an elder, which is not done." (Lu translation)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Battle Results on the Buthidaung Front: The Japanese Army's Defense Line Will Be Further Strengthened in the Future</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th that in the operation of annihilating the British Indian 7th Division on the Buthidaung front, the war results obtained so far are as follows: Approximately 7,000 enemy corpses were abandoned (including approximately 3,000 British), approximately 600 prisoners were captured, and the following weapons were seized or destroyed: more than ten cannons and fifteen howitzers, twenty artillery pieces, six anti-aircraft guns, thirty-four mortars, thirty rapid-firing guns, 1,950 rifles, forty-five tanks, 660 vehicles, seventeen boats, and sixty-two aircraft were shot down. There were also many other weapons, ammunition, and clothing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The British Indian 7th Division moved out to the Buthidaung area on February 4th. Before three weeks had passed, it was surrounded by the Japanese army in the Maungdaw Mountain Range and the Kyauktaw Basin and was routed. The second tragedy of Arakan was staged again, and the glorious war results obtained by the Japanese army were announced by the Japanese Headquarters on the afternoon of the 4th. The success of this operation by the Japanese army can be seen from the specific figures announced. The enemy's losses in this battle, as far as have been ascertained, are approximately 7,000 corpses, of which there are many British, even 3,000. If the 600 prisoners are included, then the enemy's troop losses should reach about 8,000. The enemy's casualties are indeed heavy, so the enemy's 7th Division, which had about 10,000 troops before the war, can be said to have been completely annihilated after this battle. Furthermore, judging from the enemy's weapons seized or destroyed by the Japanese army, the enemy's entire equipment has been destroyed. The success of the Kyauktaw annihilation battle can be imagined. However, the Japanese army is not satisfied with this and is still continuing to mop up the remaining enemies in order to completely destroy the British Indian 7th Division. Therefore, the war results of the Japanese army will be even greater in the future. Also, the war results of this battle include those obtained by the Azad Hind Fauj, which cooperated with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from New Delhi, the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command announced the battle situation on the Arakan Line on the 3rd, stating: The Western Akyab garrison is currently fighting on the Kaladan River and is suffering strong pressure from the Japanese army northwest of Awaauk.</p>
<p>The British Main Force Annihilated in the Kyauktaw Basin</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain base of the Japanese army in Burma, the British 7th Division previously echoed the British 5th Division's attack on the Maungdaw area, launched an advance operation on the entire Buthidaung line, and clamored to recapture Nitzan. The Japanese army launched a breakthrough operation against the enemy at 2:00 PM on the 4th of this month. In just 20 days, the main force of the enemy in the Kyauktaw Basin was reduced, and the Japanese army's reduction operation was largely concluded. The mopping up of the remaining enemies is still continuing, and the British army is staging the second act of the Arakan tragedy here. After the British army was defeated in Arakan last spring, it still attempted to counterattack from the western front of the Indian-Burmese border in order to attack and advance its air bases. The Japanese army then carried out a blitzkrieg operation to encircle the enemy and cut off the British army's retreat at three locations west of Tongubazar, Ngakyedauk, and the Kyauktaw Basin, completing the encirclement and annihilating the enemy's main force. Although the enemy was extremely cautious beforehand, it also had a sense of arrogance about this blitzkrieg operation. A large unit of the enemy's brigade was chased and attacked by only a small unit of twenty or thirty Japanese soldiers, and they were in a state of extreme embarrassment. This was the first time this had been seen in this operation. Lord Mountbatten personally went to the front line to direct the operation in December and encouraged the front-line troops. He actually regarded the Japanese army's strategic retreat in Maungdaw as their recapture of the area and even proclaimed to the world that the British Indian side had opened up a resource area and opened up a blood transfusion route to the besieged side to cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the supply route in the south. All of the above ambitions have now completely failed. This kind of stupid move is tantamount to digging one's own grave, and the Chongqing side is also gradually recognizing the crisis of the anti-axis air force on the Indian-Burmese battle line and is extremely dissatisfied with the incompetence of the British Indian army. They frankly admit that the Japanese army still holds the main force of the war situation. They also point to the fact that Japan's combat power is strong. Even though the Japanese army is currently inviting and attacking the enemy's American army's general counterattack in the central and southern Pacific, it can still smash the British army's more than ten-month counterattack preparation in one fell swoop, which is enough to prove that the Japanese army still has a huge combat power. Therefore, the enemy side may also know that a frontal attack on the Nu River and Myanmar from land will have no effect in the end. Even if the British Indian army launches a third counterattack, there are only three months left before the rainy season, and preparations for battle cannot be completed during this dry period. Furthermore, the Japanese army's defense line will only become stronger and stronger in the future. This operation only lasted 20 days (the previous operation lasted two months). Subhas Chandra Bose also led the Indian National Army, holding high the banner of "Overthrow Britain and Liberate the Motherland," and cooperated with the Japanese army in the operation. The three-color flag of Independent India is flying in the sky above Arakan, and the situation of attacking Chittagong has been completed. This has given a great response to the Indian soldiers who have been suffering under British repression for many years and have been thinking of severely attacking the British. Recently, Indian soldiers in the British Indian army have been surrendering one after another, so the future trend of the war is quite worthy of attention.</p>

<h3>Conflict Between British and American Generals Over Delayed Offensive in Burma</h3>
<p>Geneva, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to information obtained by the Belgians: A serious conflict has occurred between General Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Southeast Asia, and General Stilwell, the Supreme Commander of the American Army in India. Mountbatten dispatched his Chief of Staff, General Weitanja, to act as a mediator. General Stilwell criticized Mount for not launching a major offensive to retake Burma. General Tanyia stated in Washington that Mount was unable to act cautiously due to a lack of ships, thus hindering his preparations. The American War Department also agreed with this explanation. Mountbatten's main objective is to retake Burma and Malaya, while Stilwell's objective is to retake Burma as the starting point for launching an offensive in East Asia, because if Burma can be obtained, supplies can be transported to Burma, making a major offensive against Japan possible.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Carries Out Offensive and Interception Battles in Various Regions: 407 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Last Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 11:30 AM on the 4th: In February, the Imperial Army units conducted offensive and interception operations against the enemy air force, and the comprehensive results obtained were as follows: In the China area, 31 were shot down (including 14 unconfirmed), 12 were destroyed.

<h3>Satisfaction with Japanese Accommodation Facilities for Foreigners: Report from Red Cross Representatives</h3>
<p>Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Axis powers have extensively propagated the way Japan treats detained foreigners. According to a report from Bern, representatives of the International Red Cross stationed in Shanghai have stated that as a result of inspecting Japanese detention centers, it has been determined that all facilities are satisfactory. Thus, the false propaganda of the anti-Axis powers is self-defeating.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Minister of Agriculture Hosts Japanese Dignitaries</h3>

<h3>The National History Compilation Committee Holds Its First Plenary Meeting: Compilation of Biographical Materials Has Begun</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to compile national history, the government established the National History Compilation Committee in July of last year, and specially appointed Chen Qun as the chief commissioner.

This reporter approached Governor Luo to inquire about everything in order to clarify the specific implementation steps of Wuqing in the future. The Governor informed me that the highest goal of Wuqing is to ensure law and order and stabilize people's livelihood. For Wuqing in the province, Wuhu and Dangtu counties will first be designated as the first phase. After success is achieved, it will then be expanded from this center to the whole name. In addition to military suppression, this period of work also focuses on promoting and reforming various departments such as economy, production, and education. I dare not predict what the results of the first phase of Wuqing's implementation will be, but I always hope that the employees at all levels will work hard and be down-to-earth. In addition, I hope that people from all walks of life will thoroughly recognize the meaning of Wuqing, stimulate their love for their hometown, and actively assist in jointly completing this great mission, etc.</p>

<h3>Fierce Defensive Battles on the Eastern Front: Soviet Offensives Repulsed in the North and Center</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities explained the situation on the Eastern Front on the 3rd, and also pointed out the reality that the Soviet army was frustrated in its attempt to cut off the German front lines in the north and center, as follows: Although the large-scale offensive by the Soviet army against the German positions on the northern front, such as Narva and Pskov, has not ended, a second winter offensive has now been launched on the central front. The German army's withdrawal and shortening of the front line in the Lake Ilmen area has been completed, and the Soviet army's attempts to break through into the Baltic states in that area have been frustrated. On the northern front, the Soviet army has achieved some success by attacking with a very large number of troops, and the Soviet troops that have advanced to the west bank of the Narva River have been stopped by the German army's strong defenses. In recent days, the Soviet army has launched a large-scale attack. The Soviet offensive on the central front is closely linked to the offensive in the north. The Soviet army, with large units of tanks and infantry, has launched a fierce attack on the north of Nevel. The Soviet operational goal is to put pressure on the right flank of the German army on the northern front, and at the same time break into Latvia and reach the Baltic coast to encircle the German army on the northern front. The Soviet offensives launched in recent days in the Vitebsk and Bobruisk areas are aimed at encircling the German army on the central front. However, the Soviet army's breakthrough offensives in the Nevel and Rogachev areas have been brought to a standstill due to the German army's tenacious counterattacks.</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Harshly Criticizes Turkish Policy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report from London: British newspapers have been criticizing Turkey, and the "Yorkshire Post" openly threatens Turkish foreign policy, saying that "if Turkish policy is not coordinated with British and Soviet policy, it will lack one of the conditions for lasting success." The newspaper is the mouthpiece of British Foreign Secretary Eden, and the publication of these unusually strong remarks is obviously the intention of the government. The newspaper declared that Britain's cessation of supplying Turkey with war materiel shows that the Turkish government does not want to make its greatest contribution to the anti-Axis powers in the "short period" before the opening of a second front.</p>
<p>America Will Follow Britain's Lead and Stop Supplying War Materiel</p>

<h3>Situation on the Italian Front Presents a Muddled Picture: German Army Secures Initiative</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent on the Italian front reported: "The Third Kesselring Offensive," which began on February 29, ended on the 2nd of this month after 36 hours of fierce fighting. German military authorities have announced that the German army has secured the initiative in the operation. On the 2nd, due to the activities of assault troops, new positions have been occupied. A Reuters reporter also silently acknowledged this fact and stated that the main force of the anti-Axis army in the Cisterna-Aprilia area, which the German army began attacking on the 29th, was the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division.</p>
<p>40,000 Bombs Dropped on the Nettuno Area</p>
<p>On the 2nd, the anti-Axis army mobilized an unprecedentedly large air force on the Mediterranean front and dropped 40,000 twenty-pound shrapnel bombs on the Nettuno area. From this, one can see how anxious the anti-Axis authorities are to open up the deadlocked battle situation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - A German news agency reported: On the Nettuno beachhead, active local battles continued on the 2nd, and the initiative there is still in the hands of the German army. No major changes have occurred there, but a large number of German stormtroopers launched a fierce attack on the Anglo-American defenses on both sides of the Aprilia-Anzio highway, and finally advanced the German line. West of Cisterna, an attempted attack by U.S. paratroopers failed despite being covered by heavy artillery fire. Further east in the same area, a strong unit of U.S. stormtroopers was wiped out. Only one thing is worth mentioning on the southern Italian front: in the Atri area, a unit of German stormtroopers penetrated deep into the British lines, destroyed a British ammunition depot, captured many British prisoners of war, and returned to their own positions.</p>
<h3>Pope Protests Indiscriminate Bombing of Rome</h3>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Rome: On the 3rd, the anti-Axis air force again indiscriminately bombed the Vatican, damaging the windows of St. Paul's Outside the Walls and killing 40 refugees and wounding 200.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to the "Daily Mail," the U.S. Petroleum Department suggests that in order to prevent the oil needed by the Pacific theater from being cut off during the blockade, an oil pipeline should be laid in Mexico. The Mexican government has not yet given its permission. The Petroleum Department's move has not been supported by private oil companies, which believe that it interferes with private interests. However, they also fear that Interior Secretary Ickes will implement it decisively, as he has said that both the Army and Navy departments support the plan. Private companies argue that if the plan is implemented, the United States will have disputes with the foreign countries through which the oil pipeline passes.</p>
<h3>British Casualties Now Reach 170,000</h3>

<h3>U.S. Intelligence Chief in Turkey, Littman, Arrested</h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuter's report from Rome today: The news of the arrest in New York of Littman, the Jewish U.S. intelligence chief in Istanbul, has aroused great interest among the Romans. During the reign of former Romanian King Carol, Littman rented a gambling den in Sinaia and defrauded the government of large sums of money. Shortly before the outbreak of the European war, Littman went to Turkey to take up his current post, where he revealed several secret documents, which were later found to be forged. Local newspapers believe that although Littman has been arrested, he will not be seriously affected, as U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt is also Jewish and will certainly make efforts to save him.</p>
<h3>Reviewing the Must-Win Life</h3>
<p>The news of the enemy army landing in the Marshall Islands has come, and the war is gradually approaching Japanese territory. But at this time, we should not panic, nor is there any need to shout slogans. So, what should we do? Where is victory? If we calmly reflect on our lives, we can discover that the path to victory is right beside us, and everyone can know it, as long as we firmly grasp this opportunity and resolutely implement it.</p>
<p>The Revolution of Life</p>
<p>Everyone hopes to eat refined white rice and fill their bellies, and everyone hopes to travel and be idle, which may be human nature. And hearing the children wanting to eat snacks, and being dissatisfied with the rationing system when there are no snacks, may be understandable. But taking this opportunity of the enemy army attacking the Marshall Islands, let us think about it again. If the enemy's ambition extends to our homeland, what will happen then? At that time, what fate will befall you who eat white rice and feel full, or you who have taken a happy trip home, or the children who eat the snacks they struggled to buy in the crowded market? The enemy openly shouts the audacious slogan of "eradicating the Japanese race." Let us calmly reflect on this insolent statement by the enemy. Shouldn't we restrain all desires and endure pain? Every citizen should calmly think about that last penny. Taking this opportunity of the enemy army attacking the Marshall Islands, we should sincerely abandon our corrupt past life of yesterday. That is for the sake of the country, for the sake of yourself.</p>
<p>This is a Victorious Life</p>
<p>Then, in order to achieve victory, what kind of life should we live? This is not a difficult thing. No, you have already experienced most of it. On February 5, Mr. Kawano Mitsuru said the following on the Diet floor in his words of appreciation and encouragement to those who were conscripted: "In a certain coal mine, the wife of a conscripted person saw that her husband was hungry, so she reduced her three meals to two meals, and ate thin rice porridge every day, in order for her husband to complete the task of coal mining." This passage moved everyone in the room to tears. The life of this wife is also one of the paths to victory. In other words, do your best in your own life, and live and work with an "attitude and spirit of martyrdom." In any case, hold the magnificent spirit of not being defeated by foreign devils. I know that people in rural villages, factories, and tribal gatherings all have this kind of spirit, but are there any places that are not thorough? Think about it yourself, start a new life by fighting with the "enemy within your heart," and build a victorious life that has no gaps in any place within 24 hours. There is no other beneficial way.</p>
<p>Areas for Reform</p>
<p>To give an example, the factory workers who directly produce aircraft in military factories are truly honorable. But what if they don't go to the factory because they have a minor illness, or live a life of leisure because they have a high income? That would be an "American comrade." Furthermore, what if a guidance official who shouts to the people during the day to "reform their lives and promote production" lives a lavish life? We must always remember our current lives and work for the country. At the same time, do we have even a bit of the "enemy's comrade"? We don't need to talk about other people's lives. We should reflect on ourselves and reform.</p>
<p>If every one of the 100 million citizens reflects on themselves in this way, it will be the path to victory. There is no need to criticize others, teach others, or have any discontent or dissatisfaction. The points that should be reflected upon, we have already heard until our ears are calloused: "Conserve war clothes," "Don't take useless trips," "Buy government bonds," "Strive for savings"... Everyone knows these things well enough. If we think of the worst-case scenario, we should earnestly carry out what everyone can do from tomorrow. Moving forward is victory.</p>
<p>Some may think: "Okay, let's do it. But is the current rationing adequate?" "Can production be increased at that price?" "The sailors in the Northern Kuriles are fighting the war against the severe cold, wearing newspapers and rags on their feet, and silently engaging in battle. Can this not be improved?" At the must-win Diet session on January 21, representatives presented all these questions to the government. People who heard the Q&amp;A in detail that day felt: "The authorities also frankly accepted the voices of the people and revealed what they believed." Thus, the representatives of the 100 million citizens and the government have reached a resolution.</p>
<p>Victory is Imminent</p>
<p>The enemy army has attacked the Marshall Islands: We must revolutionize our lives. This is a very important opportunity. There is no need to worry for no reason, nor to be pessimistic. It is boastful to say that the number of aircraft is large. Last December, only 9,000 aircraft were produced. Moreover, these fighter planes must be deployed in Europe and elsewhere. With the efforts of 100 million citizens, mass production can be achieved soon.</p>
<p>Save gas and electricity, and contribute to production. Recycle metals and contribute resources. Respond to the call to increase the production of resources and coal, do not take wasteful trips or hoard goods to increase transportation capacity. Those who have not completed labor management, regardless of gender, should all contribute labor to the country. Then, the enemy's mass production is also not to be feared. Only determination and effort are needed. Before people ask me, we should contribute first. If we can endure one or two years of hardship and have the spirit to persevere, then victory is imminent. Japan has a world-unique national polity, and the frontline fathers have the world's best army and navy. From now on, the 100 million citizens in the rear should thoroughly implement a "war life!" (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, February 7)</p>

<h3>Social Welfare Bureau to Handle Rent Disputes: Proposes Four Measures for Dispute Resolution</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of rent disputes in the city, the former Social Welfare Bureau had drafted seventeen articles of the "Provisional Regulations for Handling Rent Disputes in the Shanghai Special Municipality," which were submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. However, now that Districts One and Eight have merged, the Social Welfare Offices of the two District Governments have been abolished, and their original functions have been taken over by the Social Welfare Bureau. However, since the city is a mixed residence of Chinese and foreigners, rent disputes often occur in which both parties or one party is a foreigner. Therefore, the Bureau has drafted four measures for adjusting the handling of rent disputes, which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and notification to the First District Government for compliance in order to unify the handling. The adjustment measures are as follows: 1. The mediation of rent disputes handled by the former Social Welfare Office of the First District Government should be stopped immediately and handled by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau in order to centralize authority. 2. Rent disputes involving foreigners may be handled by the First District Government at the discretion of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau. When mediation fails and the case is submitted to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for arbitration, the First District Government should be requested to send representatives to attend the arbitration. 3. The rules for handling rent disputes involving foreigners will be drafted by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. 4. Before the implementation of housing sublease licenses in the city, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau may temporarily entrust the First District Government to handle them. Therefore, in the future, all rent disputes in the city, whether both parties or one party is a foreigner or both parties are Chinese, will be handled uniformly by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since being ordered to handle rent disputes in the city, the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau has only mediated all disputes as much as possible. If mediation fails, the cases are submitted to the Municipal Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee for arbitration in accordance with the law. In January and February of this year, the Bureau accepted a total of sixty-seven rent dispute cases, of which thirty-two cases were resolved through guidance for self-settlement or mediation (including seven cases in which one party was a foreigner). The Municipal Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee accepted a total of thirty-five rent dispute cases, of which six cases were settled on the spot and eight cases were adjudicated, all in accordance with the law and impartially.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Meningitis Has Spread to the Southern District: Health Office Engaged in Suppression</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, several cases of the dreaded epidemic meningitis have occurred in the Southern District, and the situation is extremely rampant. The Southern District Health Office is now actively engaged in suppression. The Southern District Isolation Hospital has begun to admit patients with meningitis.</p>
<p>Cases of Meningitis Have Been Discovered</p>
<p>Several cases of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, commonly known as meningitis, have been discovered in the Southern District. Investigations have revealed that Yu Xinglong, a nine-year-old child living at No. 5 Yongshou Lane, Fangbang Road, and Yu Didi, a three-month-old boy, Meng Fu, an eighteen-year-old youth living at No. 789 Minguo Road, and a certain family living at No. 657 Fangbang Road have all contracted the disease. The patients have been sent to the Isolation Hospital for treatment, and their residences have been disinfected by personnel from the Southern District Health Office to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Symptoms, Current Situation, and Prevention Methods</p>
<p>Epidemic meningitis is extremely contagious. With slight carelessness, one can be infected. Patients are mostly children. The initial symptoms of the disease are headache, fever, palpitations, stiff neck, and frequent nausea. If the pupils do not react, it is clear that the disease has been contracted and should be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately. The disease is most easily contracted in public places, including theaters and streetcars. For prevention, both adults and children should pay attention to the cleanliness of their sensory organs. They must wear masks when going out, with a little peppermint oil dripped inside the mask, so that the patient's saliva will not infect others. If one is unfortunately infected, in addition to sending the patient for immediate treatment, the room in which the patient lives must be disinfected to prevent a second infection.</p>
<h3>District Household Rice: Payments Must Be Made on Time</h3>
<p>The City Food Bureau, in order to implement per capita grain distribution every period, found that a small number of public offices failed to remit payments quickly, which was sufficient to affect the scheduled sale of household rice. Therefore, at 3:00 PM yesterday, the Bureau convened a meeting of responsible personnel from the joint offices of the various district governments in its conference room, stipulating that rice payments should be remitted on time in the future without further delay. Representatives from the various public offices unanimously agreed with this move by the Food Bureau. Therefore, the handling of per capita grain distribution in the various districts can be gradually improved in the future.</p>

The salaries of the laid-off redundant personnel will be added to those who work diligently. It has been found that the standards for these layoffs are: 1) those who do not come to the office every day, or are often late or leave early; 2) those whose positions are light and have no actual work; 3) those who frequently ask for leave and have demerits; 4) those who have weak abilities and are incompetent. Each agency should formulate a plan in accordance with the above standards and submit it to the municipal government for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>Yesterday's telegram special question 7:25</p>
<h3>Implementing Light Control Sun Life Talk Deeply Hope to Carry Out the Full Work</h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Life, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Special City Civil Defense Headquarters, made the following statement on the implementation of light control this time:</p>
<p>Has profound meaning</p>
<p>Yesterday was March 3rd, and Shanghai has entered the sub-war stage. According to the notice No. 21 issued by the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command on the 1st of this month, from the 3rd of this month, every day from sunset to sunrise the next morning, light control will be implemented throughout the territory under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government.</p>
<p>It has been found that light control has been held several times in Shanghai in the past, and it is well known to the citizens. Especially after January 9th this year, the anniversary of China's participation in the war, was designated as "Air Defense Day," light control matters became an important part of air defense training, and it was implemented in quality. However, the light control implemented this time is suitable for wartime light control and has a semi-permanent nature, which is fundamentally different from what has been held in the past. This section should be deeply understood by the citizens.</p>
<p>Past training light control was only held on a designated day and time, and the time was very short. Even the extremely simple method of turning off the lights was used to deal with it in order to fulfill the responsibility. The light control that is rewarded this time is not the case. It has a deeper meaning and should be controlled every day, not just held for a short time. In other words, it should be regarded as an important part of citizens' daily life with a semi-permanent nature and implemented until the Great East Asia War of the two countries of China and Japan achieves the final victory.</p>
<p>Strive to defend the sky</p>
<p>Since China and Japan have been working together and standing at the critical moment of life and death to declare war with Britain and the United States, it has been more than one year and two months. Since the beginning of the war, Shanghai has been within the scope of the war and has been clearly seen to be in danger of being bombed by enemy aircraft at any time. However, the citizens of Shanghai are almost the same as usual and have continued their normal lives, thinking that light control matters, like those held during training, can be done at most once a month, which is really unthinkable and cannot be used as a lesson. It is now felt that it is already too late to implement wartime light control.</p>
<p>In any case, the current combat area is not very far from Shanghai, and Shanghai is also a battlefield. Moreover, the sudden national air force is aiming to carry out the largest air raid to disrupt peaceful areas, staring at it and waiting for an opportunity to move. It is very obvious that Shanghai will become one of the most important wax battlefields, and it is not necessary to repeat it.</p>
<p>The war in Europe and the war in Greater East Asia are all wars for nations to fight for survival, and the Great East Asia War jointly fought by China and Japan has its special purpose, that is, to fundamentally eliminate the policy of aggression against East Asia by Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands for a hundred years, so that the liberated nations of Greater East Asia can unite and build Greater East Asia as an ideal, and seek the independence of all East Asian nations.</p>
<p>In order to seek the independence of all East Asian nations, and to fight for the highest ideal of building a liberated Greater East Asia, our country has risen up again to work with Japan. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we are marching on the road to completing the war. Therefore, even if Shanghai becomes a major battlefield today, because the citizens of China really have a firm secondary heart, it is not affected in the slightest. We citizens can only use an attitude of non-busyness and non-disturbance to move forward on the road to defending the sky over Greater Shanghai under the wise guidance of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command and the Shanghai Special City Civil Defense Headquarters for things that are expected to come and have already arrived.</p>
<p>Hope citizens cooperate</p>
<p>Since the defeat of the United States at Pearl Harbor, it has been defeated repeatedly. Only now has it gradually recovered from its initial tragic defeat. It is only relying on its world-shattering material resources and madly calling out the slogan of the general counterattack in the Pacific. With the central and southwestern Pacific as the main battlefields, it is re-enacting the great job of corpse mountains and blood seas. The elite land and naval forces of our ally Japan are not afraid of the strong and are dealing with the enemy. The Japanese people are holding on to the determination to "fight to the end." Although the current situation is uncertain, our East Asian nations have no doubt about the final victory. However, while the United States is frantically calling for a counterattack in the Pacific, it is also working to strengthen its air force in China and is always attacking important cities in Japan and peaceful areas.</p>
<p>The light control this time is implemented in view of the reckless state of the US Air Force in China, in order to protect Greater Shanghai, which is at risk of being attacked by air at any time, and to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the five million citizens. This is a necessary move. Our citizens participate in this move, which is to protect their own lives and property. In Greater Shanghai, even a little carelessness and the leakage of a ray of light will become a good target for air raid bombers and plunge the city into flames. I hope that all citizens can fully understand the position of Shanghai under the Great East Asia War and the importance of light control in air defense, and sincerely cooperate with this control in order to achieve good results.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command, in view of strategic relations, especially adheres to the proposition and earnestly implements light control. In order to cooperate in completing the defense of Shanghai, the Air Defense Headquarters will severely punish those who violate it. We hope that all citizens can understand and cooperate.</p>
<p>Maintain night work</p>
<p>The following are some points that citizens should pay attention to when implementing light control: The general principle for residential houses during light control is to cover all windows (including skylights) with black cloth and blinds. However, indoor electric lights, such as those with less than 20 candlepower, covered with black lampshades with an angle of more than 20 degrees, and whose roofs do not reflect light, do not need to be specially covered with black cloth blinds. From this point of view, this electric light control is said to be much more lenient than what was held during past training.</p>
<p>However, the Great East Asia War has entered the secondary war stage, and the US Air Force in China is still reckless. The citizens of Shanghai urgently need to prepare materials for light control, so that at any time, they can turn from the current preparatory control to the real air raid control. It is very expensive for citizens to buy new fabrics, so they must try to make use of waste. Even under light control, it is still necessary to increase production and maintain other necessary night work without being hindered. Based on the experience gained from past training, work hard.</p>
<p>It is expected that citizens will feel various inconveniences due to light control. However, this is a self-defense measure that should be taken by the people in the rear to ensure their own lives and property and to strive for victory in the war. Even if there is confusion, it is not enough to care about it. I deeply hope that you will work hard, implement the control, and complete the full work. This is my most sincere prayer.</p>
<h3>Largest Scale Institution for Refugee Children: Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute</h3>
<p>From the terminus of the Third Tram Line at Macgregor Road to Wuding Road, stepping onto the black, fine-sand Macgregor Road, less than two hundred steps, on the left wall, the white characters on a blue background "Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute" stand out prominently. Walking into the Fang Ji Warehouse, pushing open the door on the right, one finds a spacious and bright campus. Including the thirty-five Western-style houses, the grand and new-style refugee children's dormitory building stands before one's eyes.</p>
<p>Establishment and Development</p>
<p>The heroic and robust middle-aged Mr. Lu Zhong'en, the Chief Executive of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, after a warm greeting, spoke about the story of the birth of this largest-scale refugee children's educational institution in Shanghai, amidst many difficulties.</p>
<p>It was in the 27th year of the Republic (1938) that Shanghai was filled with wandering, destitute refugee children, but there were very few shelters and educational institutions. In May, Li Ruzhang and others began preparations for its establishment, and on the 15th of July, the "Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute" was announced in the Leshan Temple on Jin Shenfu Road, clearly stating its purpose as "to shelter refugee children from families in financial difficulty and unable to raise them." At that time, due to various limitations in terms of funding, personnel, and the location of the institute, the total number of refugee children sheltered was only twenty-seven. Six months later, Lu Wen took over the task, and as people from all walks of life gradually became aware of the institute's work, destitute refugee children flocked to it like streams returning to the sea. The number of children sheltered increased to three hundred and six. In the 28th year (1939), efforts were made to rent the current site at No. 99, Lane 25, Wuding Road, and twenty-seven dormitory buildings and ten single-story houses were built, and the scale gradually became complete. As Mr. Lu Zhong'en spoke, he specially led us to view the construction of the dormitory building. It is worth noting that the institute's toilets have underground septic facilities and do not have the unpleasant odor common to ordinary toilets, which is rarely seen in Shanghai charitable institutions. At that time, it was donated by a certain construction company, and the cost was more than ten thousand yuan!</p>
<p>In March of the 30th year (1941), Mr. Gao Huailiang succeeded as the director of the institute. With his ability, he further reorganized the institute's affairs and developed the educational work, adding eight new dormitory buildings. Recently, in order to facilitate access, an agreement was reached with Fang Ji Warehouse to borrow No. 601 Macgregor Road as the main gate of the institute, making the refugee children's academy appear even more dignified and solemn in form. In terms of scale, it does not lose its status as "the first in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Disciplined Life</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute currently houses a total of two hundred and fifty-four male and female refugee children. The three aspects of nurturing, managing, and educating are all the responsibility of staff members assigned by the institute. There are two departments, the Nurturing Affairs Department and the Education Affairs Department, to oversee these matters.</p>
<p>In terms of nurturing, the main task is to pay attention to the overall physical health of the students in the institute. Many of the refugee children who first enter the institute suffer from scalp infections, conjunctivitis, and skin diseases such as scabies. These must first be treated, otherwise they will spread. Last year, they underwent thorough isolation treatment, and most have now recovered. There are still a few who are isolated from healthy students.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the constant health of the children, the institute has a medical room with a row of bright rooms on the second floor, including a general medical clinic, an ophthalmology, otolaryngology clinic, and an operating room, etc. All treatment equipment can be said to be readily available. Next to the clinic is the pharmacy. Several medicine cabinets are filled with various Western medicines. It is said that these were purchased in the past and are still sufficient for use. The children's illnesses are mostly skin and surgical conditions, so surgical supplies such as ointments, gauze, and absorbent cotton are insufficient. Doctors come to examine the children every day, and most of them offer their services without any remuneration, in the spirit of sacrifice. There is also a pharmacist in the institute who is responsible for medical and pharmaceutical matters.</p>
<p>In addition to medical care, attention is also paid to the cleanliness and hygiene of the students' daily lives, and reasonable rest times. The toilets have a special squatting structure to avoid the spread of skin diseases that are easily transmitted by general sitting toilets. Bathing is compulsory every day or every other day in the summer, and has been changed to once a week since autumn. After the bathrooms are used by different grades and groups at specific times, they are immediately locked to prevent the children from wasting water and to maintain the cleanliness of the bathrooms. The students' clothes are also washed at specified times, so although they are rough cloth uniforms, they are all neat and clean, and the incidence of disease is naturally reduced.</p>
<p>Every day, in addition to lectures and work, the children have a certain amount of time for games and sports. The campus still looks newly opened, is very large, and is an excellent place for sports. If some sports equipment and supplies could be added, the lives of the refugee children would surely be more meaningful!</p>
<p>Due to financial constraints, the institute's food is quite simple. Parents and children alike eat three meals of porridge a day, relying entirely on household rations, supplementing them with some purchased items, and also preparing some vegetables. Look, three pots of porridge are being cooked in the kitchen. When the lid is lifted, the heat rises, and it is not clear what the ingredients are. Several large buckets of cooked, dark yellow, thick porridge are on the ground, giving off a slight aroma. Piles of cabbage in the cupboard are the only vegetable dishes.</p>
<p>All the bedrooms are furnished with double-layered iron beds, with snow-white sheets spread on the mattresses. The same applies to boys, girls, and faculty members. After getting up, they are all locked, and are not allowed to be entered privately except at bedtime or in special circumstances, thus maintaining cleanliness. Autumn is already deep, but the students do not yet have quilts on their beds. According to Mr. Lu, they will be distributed in winter.</p>
<p>Life is disciplined in the collective, but it is all for the benefit of the students. Love is full of discipline.</p>
<p>New Educational Methods</p>
<p>The nurturing at the Refugee Children's Education Institute has created a big family for the children in distress. The staff inside have become the mothers, sisters, and nannies of the children. However, the children also need spiritual food, intellectual enlightenment, and moral training. Therefore, the Refugee Children's Education Institute has also become an academy.</p>
<p>The Education Affairs Department is the highest leadership organization for educational work at the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, including fifteen male and female teachers, who divide the work and cooperate to carry out educational affairs, dividing the two hundred and several dozen refugee children into six grades, forming the structure of a regular complete elementary school. Originally, the year was divided into two semesters, consistent with regular elementary schools. However, in practice, it was found that during the winter and summer vacations, students could not attend classes normally, played around without anything to do, and wasted their time, which was a pity and unreasonable in terms of educational principles. Therefore, starting last year, the vacation was cancelled and the year was changed to three semesters. In this way, the students' period of study is actually shortened. The complete elementary school curriculum, which can be completed in six years in ordinary schools, now only takes four years. If necessary adjustments are made to the curriculum, and if cramming-style education is not used, so that the students do not feel that the curriculum is too heavy, and they can fully absorb, digest, and apply what they have learned, then it would not only be a new method worthy of imitation in refugee children's education, but also a research necessity in ordinary education.</p>
<p>A neat row of school buildings is distributed among the classrooms of each grade. From the slogans on the square pillars in the corridors to the forms and charts on the classroom doors and interior walls, they all show the characteristics of a school that is run in the most spirited manner. It is exam time, and the children sitting neatly in each classroom are all focused on the mimeographed exam papers. Some are writing quickly, while others are tilting their heads and thinking. The teachers are also busy, some answering individual questions in a low voice, and others watching the students' actions.</p>
<p>There are even classrooms for the first and second years of junior high school, and older students are also taking classes. Mr. Lu said that originally, after the students graduated from senior elementary school, they were allowed to apply to the corresponding middle school, and all expenses were fully borne by the school, which became the students' "reborn parents." Later, due to practical needs and possibilities, starting from the last semester, junior high school was run in-house, so that students could continue their studies at the institute after graduating from complete elementary school. However, in order to facilitate future schooling and supplementary classes, the curriculum items arranged by the institute, the textbooks used, and the daily teaching hours are completely the same as those of ordinary schools! This is all for the future of the students, which is also very rare.</p>
<p>In addition to academic education, considerable attention is also paid to the students' daily lives, personality cultivation, and group life. The teachers are responsible for moral, physical, social, and intellectual development, so that each student can become a healthy citizen of China in the future. It is said that the first and second graduating students of the institute, nine in total, were all admitted to the Xin and Shen Newspaper scholarship and loan programs. The five most outstanding students were also admitted to the Uncle Pin Public Scholarship. Currently, six people have found jobs, and the remaining three are still studying at the San Cai Middle School in this city. From this, one can see a glimpse of the institute's educational achievements.</p>
<p>Crafts and Labor</p>
<p>In order to meet the special needs of refugee children, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute, like other refugee children's educational institutions, teaches crafts and technical skills in addition to regular academic education, so that these poor children can learn considerable work skills at the institute, so that they can go out and earn a living independently if they cannot go to school, and serve the society. However, what is different from other educational institutions is that it does not implement a complete work-study program, but a "study-oriented, work-secondary" system. The time for studying is completely the same as that of ordinary schools, and time is not taken out for work. Only a certain amount of time is stipulated outside of academic time for learning crafts. This method naturally has its own good intentions in caring for refugee children.</p>
<p>In terms of craft education, the main subjects are sewing and weaving, which are only taught to girls. Next to the classrooms, in a sewing room, several sewing machines are displayed. Next door, two rows of sock-knitting machines are displayed. Every night is their time to learn crafts. It is said that the results are quite good, and their products can now be supplied for internal use in the institute. After reaching the level of "self-sufficiency" in the future, they may also be able to serve the society.</p>
<p>The boys' craft education does not seem to have started normally yet. Currently, the institute has organized a music team, selecting some children with musical talents to give them special popular music education, musical knowledge, and discipline. It has now been trained and has accepted requests from all walks of life to participate in weddings, funerals, and various ceremonies, which is highly praised by all parties, and there is also some income that can be used to subsidize the institute.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate the students' habits of self-help and helping others, and to strengthen the efficiency of the students' practical life education, the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute adheres to the principle of having the students automatically handle all affairs in the institute. Therefore, in a large institution with two or three hundred people, only two employees are hired to provide guidance and assistance. All the cleaning work, washing, organizing, arranging, moving, and other daily labor tasks are completely undertaken by the staff members, who guide the students themselves. The aim is to ensure that everything is handled in an orderly manner. The overall impression of all parts of the institute is that they are neat, clean, and artistic, which shows the self-governance and self-help ability of the children in distress. Of course, the staff members must have spent a lot of effort in organizing and guiding!</p>
<p>"Everyone has work to do, and everyone has food to eat." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's political ideal has finally been realized in the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute.</p>
<p>Perfect Organization</p>
<p>The highest organization of this large-scale refugee children's education institute is the Board of Directors, which elects the president, who is responsible for the overall administration of the institute. The current president is Mr. Gao Huailiang. Under the president, there is a chief executive (currently Mr. Lu Zhong'en) and a secretary, who assist the president in managing and planning the overall administration of the institute and supervise the various tasks of the institute. The above-mentioned directors, president, chief executive, and secretary are all willing to sacrifice and serve the refugee children's education cause without receiving any remuneration or salary.</p>
<p>The affairs of the entire institute are managed by the Administrative Affairs Department, which is parallel to the Education Affairs Department and the Nurturing Affairs Department. It includes six staff members, each of whom is given a salary of between one hundred and twenty yuan and one hundred and fifty yuan, for a total of only seven hundred and fifty yuan per month. In reality, they are completely sacrificing and serving. The administrative work is divided into five sections: the accounting section, which has one accountant, one cashier, and one collector. The accountant is responsible for preparing account books and rigorously verifying various receipts. The cashier is responsible for handling cash inflows and outflows, but all expenditures must be approved and signed by the chief executive. The collector is responsible for collecting any donations.</p>
<p>The documentation section has only one staff member, who is responsible for drafting daily external official documents and for recording the institute's daily logs for future reference. The registration section also has one staff member, who is responsible for registering the entry and exit of students and for investigating the detailed situation of the students' families.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also purchasing and storage sections. The former handles the purchase of all items needed by the institute, and does not have a dedicated staff member. It is currently handled by joint deliberation of the various sections. Purchased items are transferred to the latter, the storage section, which has one staff member. Any items needed by the staff members of the institute must be requested with a requisition form, which is approved and issued by the section. All students' clothing and other items are numbered, classified by grade, and stored in rows of large cabinets, which are kept by the grade teachers.</p>
<p>The fifteen teachers in the Education Affairs Department have monthly salaries ranging from one hundred and eighty yuan to three hundred and twenty yuan, totaling no more than two thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan. The lives of teachers are already very difficult today. The highest monthly salary for a teacher at the institute is only three hundred and twenty yuan, which is not much better than at ordinary schools. However, in terms of work, because the three-semester system is implemented, there are no holidays throughout the year, and their hard work is naturally even more admirable.</p>
<p>All staff members of the Shanghai Refugee Children's Education Institute are serving under the principle of "division of labor and cooperation." Due to the perfection of the organization and the soundness of the spirit, it is no wonder that it has been able to occupy a considerable position in the refugee children's education cause.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Yu, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Wearing the summer uniform, hanging a short sword, swaying on the streets of my hometown, it was only the first day of returning home, and the day was also for visiting Marshal Togo Heihachiro's tomb, Yasukuni Shrine, and the graves of ancestors.</p>
<p>"Why don't you wear a military uniform?" When visiting my sister's house and my uncle's family, I received the same question. I could only smile.</p>
<p>To be honest, I couldn't say what the reason was myself. I always felt shy. If I were to be polite, perhaps it was out of respect for my comrades in the military class during my fourth year. Weren't they still in the fifth grade of the Second Middle School?</p>
<p>"Your color has darkened, and you've become fatter. People will mistake you."</p>
<p>When visiting the Ogata family, I was also wearing the brownish-gray uniform from my Second Middle School days. Mr. Ogata didn't seem to mind the attire. He was probably on vacation, so he was very amiable. "You must wear your formal uniform for me to see!"</p>
<p>Only his wife didn't allow it. "You must wear your formal uniform for me to see!"</p>
<p>He went to the real person's room on the sweltering rooftop and forced him to take it out. And like when the real person first entered school, he drew out the short sword and looked at it, and admired the shoulder boards with the insignia. In the end, the wife forced the real person to lend him his uniform to try on.</p>
<p>"It looks good! With glasses, you look like a medical officer."</p>
<p>Seeing the wife wearing the military uniform, the real person said jokingly, but the wife said very seriously, "On such a military cap, you just need to put two more white coins..."</p>
<p>A military cap with white coins was the uniform of a student at the Naval Accounting School. In terms of the real person's physique, it was only a matter of ten days. The real person recalled with amusement the day a year ago.</p>
<p>After trying it on, the wife opened her mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Whenever I see the naval summer uniform, I think of that officer..."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"The training officer who gave the speech when we went to Etajima for a tour."</p>
<p>"Ah, that training officer..."</p>
<p>The real person would never forget the speaker of that deeply moving speech either. Ever since entering the school, he had closely observed the training officer's face, but he had never seen him again. At the Naval Academy, the training officers were rotated before the moisture even dried, and their terms were extremely short. "Before the moisture even dried..."</p>
<p>The wife shook her head, deeply moved.</p>
<p>(Omission)</p>
<p>I often heard upperclassmen say that when they went home, they always felt that the time was too long and boring. Now, looking at it, it was indeed true. I couldn't help but recall the Etajima life where I had to make use of every second.</p>
<p>"Mom, let me deliver rice." The real person said this to his mother one day.</p>
<p>"There's no need. You don't have to work," his mother said.</p>
<p>"Because you've come home on vacation, you can rest."</p>
<p>His older brother, Yoshi, also chimed in.</p>
<p>But the real person refused. Wearing a white shirt and the gray-blue trousers from his Second Middle School days, he came to the counter.</p>
<p>"If you want to do it yourself, then do it." With that, his mother couldn't force him to stop.</p>
<p>The real person heard his brother say that the customer's family was going to load three one-to bags of rice onto the rack of the bicycle. He was hunched over, wearing rough clothing, and at first glance, he looked like a rice shop delivery boy.</p>
<p>"I'm going." As he jumped onto the pedals of the bicycle, his older brother, Yoshi, watched from behind and laughed.</p>
<p>Two of the customers were unfamiliar, so he was very calm, but in the end, he was discovered at the last house.</p>
<p>"Mr. Real Person, you've become a naval student, and you're still coming to deliver rice."</p>
<p>"Yes." The real person blushed and smiled, his expression unchanged, as he placed the stamp on the delivery slip for the customer.</p>
<p>The deliveries were all completed, so the bicycle was light and he was happily speeding down the street near the Second Middle School. From behind, someone shouted loudly, "Hey! Tani!"</p>
<p>The real person gently stopped the bicycle by the side of the road. There, standing on the roadside, was Komori, wearing a white upper body and a black formal skirt. He was also returning home on vacation from the Army War College.</p>
<p>"It's been a long time. When did you come back?"</p>
<p>Because the other party was also a soldier, the real person spoke without ceremony. Komori was the same, also without ceremony. Both of them felt a sense of pride in being soldiers.</p>
<p>"I was just about to go to your house. The students from the military class at the Second Middle School are planning to have a hot pot dinner tomorrow night by the river, centered around you, me, and Kumazawa. So, I'm here to tell you." Komori said this with a very smug expression.</p>

<h3>Examination of Rice Production Increase</h3>
<p>— By Wang Dacai</p>
<p>Regarding the increase in rice production, we can divide it into three aspects: increasing sources, reducing waste, and adjusting distribution, to seek progress together.</p>
<p>Increasing Sources:</p>
<p>Zi (1st Heavenly Stem): Cultivation of Wasteland. Our country has a vast land and a large population, and there is much that can be utilized. In particular, the area of wasteland in North China and North Jiangsu is quite considerable. According to statistics, the area under cultivation in North China has increased by 1,291,200 mu, and in North Jiangsu, it has also increased by 30% of the original area. This is of course due to the government's attention to cultivation, but the people's needs are still not met. It is hoped that the government can further pay attention to cultivation.</p>
<p>Chou (2nd Heavenly Stem): Increasing Yield of Existing Land. Past facts tell us how significant the damage to crops is. Taking the area around Hunan last year as an example, the soybeans that died from red rust disease and the rice that was submerged by water, according to statistics from Wu County alone, amounted to more than 50 million yuan. This number is astonishing, and it forces us to pay attention to increasing crop production. Crop production can be discussed in two ways. Positively, we should emulate Japan's intensive farming system, using various scientific methods to make the most of the land and produce the greatest possible yield. Of course, these so-called various scientific methods include various aspects, such as fertilizers, seeds, and storage. With regard to seed improvement, attention should be paid to the following points: A. Cultivation of new varieties. B. Exchange of seeds. C. Inspection and selection of seeds. D. Storage of seeds. Two. Negatively, we should pay attention to water conservancy and insect extermination. The regulation of water and drought, and the prevention of locusts, etc., are particularly urgent matters.</p>
<p>Reducing Waste:</p>
<p>Zi (1st Heavenly Stem): Restriction on Rice Use in Restaurants. We would rather have no rice sold in all of Shanghai's restaurants than allow it to be wasted at will. It is advocated that restaurants specializing in selling rice be set up separately from restaurants, and if there is any surplus on that day, it must be moved to the next day, rather than allowing it to be wasted at will.</p>
<p>Chou (2nd Heavenly Stem): Prohibition of Brewing Alcohol. In today's situation of rice shortage, even the use of rice for the sole purpose of filling the stomach is not enough. However, in the face of the abnormal development of the liquor industry, it is still not declining. Therefore, in order to adapt to the wartime system, we should resolutely prohibit brewing alcohol and maintain the lives of the people and the survival of the nation.</p>
<p>Adjusting Distribution:</p>
<p>Jia (1st Celestial Stem): Restricting Private Sale of Rice and Increasing Rice Ration per Household. The private sale of rice has created a black market for rice prices. As a result, ordinary farmers, tempted by the high prices in the black market, sell rice and refuse to buy it, which affects the Rice Control Association's ability to purchase rice. Therefore, prohibiting the private sale of rice is tantamount to opening a shortcut to increasing the rice ration per household.</p>
<p>Yi (2nd Celestial Stem): Striving for Simplicity in the Distribution Mechanism, Residents Organize Cooperatives According to Their Place of Residence. Striving for simplicity in the distribution mechanism does not necessarily mean losing its confidentiality, but rather seeking to increase speed. In addition, it can reduce some malpractices. Past experience tells us that retailers sometimes cheat. Therefore, I now advocate that residents in Shanghai should organize consumer cooperatives according to their addresses and in accordance with the Baojia system, either one Bao or one Lianbao each (temporarily naming it as the Consumption Cooperative of Lianbao (Bao) No. in District No. ), with each resident as a member, and then the government will distribute rice and other daily necessities according to the number of members. In addition, one point that is linked to this is the need to achieve openness, otherwise it will be no different from a disguised grain store.</p>
<p>Bing (3rd Celestial Stem): Investigation and Statistics of Rice. To solve the current food problem, we must first solve the production problem, as mentioned earlier. The second is the distribution problem. However, how much is our country's total grain production? Today, we should first conduct on-the-spot investigations. For provinces and counties with insufficient grain, on the one hand, we should increase production, and on the other hand, we should adjust the surplus and make statistics for experts to study.</p>
<p>Ding (4th Celestial Stem): Organization of Storage Facilities at all levels.</p>
<p>The ancients said, "Three years of farming yields one year of storage, and nine years of work yields three years of storage. Even if there are floods and droughts, people will still have a healthy complexion." From this, we can know the importance of accumulation. For today and for the future, we should seek to improve the effectiveness of the warehouses established in various provinces, counties, townships, and villages.</p>
<p>Wu (5th Celestial Stem): State-Run Food Supply. Under the current state of war, the price of food is bound to skyrocket. In order to alleviate the suffering of the people, the government can establish a "food subsidy" to keep the price of rice low, and use this fund to compensate the losses of the factory owners. This is a temporary measure to keep the price of rice down. In addition, the government should purchase food. This has already been done through the organization of the Rice Control Association, but it is even more necessary to establish a state-run food supply, or use this food factory to directly distribute to various new consumer cooperatives. On the one hand, it can stabilize market prices, and on the other hand, it can control the mixture of other ingredients in rice flour to make food.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points, some of which the National Government is currently carrying out or preparing to carry out in the future, and the other items, need to be planned by the authorities and supported by the government and the public in order to achieve significant results.</p>

<h3>Physicians' Volunteer Medical Service</h3>
<p>Doctor Ding Fubao, in order to serve the Acupuncture Association, will be in charge of all patients with lung disease or neurasthenia residing in the Fuguang Sanatorium. He will not charge consultation fees and will use hygiene, self-cultivation, health, longevity, and other methods to help patients get rid of their suffering as soon as possible. The sanatorium is located at 123 Route Masnan. In addition, the hospital, because of the soaring prices of medicines and the lack of medicinal materials in the market, has established a Department of Mental Treatment, headed by Doctor Chen. He will use methods such as meditation, breathing, massage, hypnosis, etc., to radically cure insomnia, neurasthenia, gout, anemia, and various chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Our specially contracted dentist, Li Fei, previously treated Mr. Ban [likely a typo, should be Pan, translater] a clear-minded debater for this newspaper. Now, in order to continue his service, he has decided that from March 1st, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, teachers of primary and secondary schools or poor people with bad teeth can request a certificate from this office and go to Dr. Li's clinic for free treatment, limited to three people per day. The clinic is located at Room 411, No. 451 Jiangxi Road, Chenchen Building.</p>
<p>Lectures</p>
<p>The Moral Lecture is scheduled for every Sunday morning from 9:00 to 12:00, focusing on self-cultivation. In addition to the two main lecturers, Sun and Yang, biologist Mr. Gu Zhongchao will give a lecture on what biology tells us about human nature. Address: Cangzhou Shuchang, Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>For the purpose of promoting Buddhism in this city, the Jing'an Temple has specially invited Master Xingci, a contemporary master of Tiantai Buddhism, to come to the temple to lecture on the entire Ksitigarbha Sutra starting tomorrow. It is said that Master Xingci has been promoting Buddhism in Shanghai for more than 40 years, with profound doctrines and high morality. The number of people who have taken refuge under his guidance is no less than hundreds of thousands.</p>
<h3>Friendship Day Gathering of Elders</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>On Friendship Day, the elders of the Qiying Society held a tea party at the Victory Tea House yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to celebrate. In the afternoon at 5:00 PM, Mr. Chen, the president of the Zhongbao Newspaper, hosted a banquet at the Industrial and Commercial Association to entertain the attendees. More than ten people attended, including Sun Fumin, Zhu Juefo, Zhao Ximing, Sha Shilang, Zhang Le'er, Huang Jingwan, Ma Wenwo, Chen Qianming, Li Qiyun, Li Shencai, Hu Weiqing, Cai Rongsheng, Zhang Youliang, Shen Hongkang, Yan Boxun, Yu Shaoqiao, Wang Zhendong, and Pan Xingqiao. In terms of origin, there were eight provinces, including Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as Shanghai. In terms of age, two were over 70, three were over 60, five were over 50 and five were over 40, and one each were over 30 and over 20. In terms of gender, one-eighth were female. Although one dare not say that all the talents were present, it could be called a gathering of young and old. Mr. Huang Jingwan stood up to give a speech, saying that today is March 3rd, the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the tenth week of the International Friendship Day. He has served for 33 years, so he initiated this gathering of friends, starting with the six "Zheng" characters: "Zheng" the heart, do "Zheng" things, be close to "Zheng" people, walk the "Zheng" path, write "Zheng" books, and cultivate "Zheng" Qi. He also recited an ancient poem: "Friends who are only interested in power and profit should not be close, make friends with older and more mature people. Goodness naturally has the fragrance of orchids, and mutual dependence reveals true nature." Then, Li Qiyun, Sun Fumin, Ma Wenwo, Zhao Ximing, Zhu Juefo, and Wang Zhendong gave speeches, all emphasizing that friends occupy the most important position in the five relationships. The friendship between Guan Zhong and Bao Shuya and Chen Lei is universally praised. The friendship that transcends age is like a breeze. Gather through literature, build neighborliness through virtue, converse like water, and share interests like orchids. Foster association based on harmony, not driven by profit, to achieve mutual assistance and benefit each other. Nowadays, people's hearts are not as ancient, customs are declining, especially in Shanghai. There are many people who only seek power and profit, indulging in wine and meat. It is truly sighing. The gentlemen who came today are all indifferent to fame and fortune, so the dishes served are only six bowls and one soup, costing only 50 yuan per guest, without drinking alcohol or smoking, practicing thrift, which is a great example to follow. Mr. Huang's emphasis on the six "Zheng" characters corresponds to the three words "Liu He San Gu." Checking, three is an auspicious number, heaven, earth, and man are called the three talents, sun, moon, and stars are the three lights, and the Zhuanghui solution is called the three yuan. A gentleman has three joys, and we wish and praise the three flowers. Even in terms of making friends, the Analects discuss gains and losses, also starting from the three characters. There are three kinds of beneficial friends and three kinds of detrimental friends, so the number three is definitely related to Friendship Day. I hope that all of you present will remember today's gathering and not forget it. The meeting adjourned at 7:20 PM. Originally, it was supposed to be a time of ten thousand lights, but unfortunately, there was a blackout that day, so it was pitch black outside, making it difficult to walk. I said that when moving forward in the dark, one should pay more attention, muster spirit, and grope forward. Everyone agreed, and then they parted ways to return home, already at 8:00 PM. I held a pen to write this record as a memento.</p>
