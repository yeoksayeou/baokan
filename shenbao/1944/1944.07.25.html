<h3>勇猛邁進</h3>
<p>盟邦直相小磯國昭氏於組閣完成後，苜次廣播，以挺身躍起，開闢新天地，勇猛邁進，堅定必勝之信念，昭示國人，意義極爲深長。國家是國民的集體，國民怎樣努力，國家也就有怎樣的成績，國民都能够挺身躍起，國民都能够勇猛邁進，國家那有不興盛的道理。</p>
<p>我們說過，大東亞戰爭是革命的解放戰，因此，學八爲維持他們百年來榨取東亞的利益起見，必定用最大的力量來掙扎。大東亞戰爭是百年壓迫的結果，大東亞戰爭的成，功是勢所必然的一件事，這是火勢所趨，任何人都不能阻止我們在大東亞戰爭的勝利。但是在戰爭的過程中，在敵人孤注一擲的時候，我們必須用最大的力量去控制他，我們一方面要忍着勞，耐住苦，一方面更需用全力來勇猛邁進，一擊破敵。</p>
<p>前東條首相於十八日發表談話時會說：「唯有今日適爲擊滅仇敵，一決勝負之絕好時機，值此時機，爲守護我皇國，唯有前進一途，心中無妄想，目下無死生，恪守戰訓，傾舉全力，迅速滅敵」。前後兩首相的言論，表示盟邦的國策，表示盟邦國策的澈底堅定，表示盟邦國策的始終如一。</p>
<p>勇猛邁進不是空話，而是事實成績的表現。這次內閣改組，米內光政大將以六十五歲的高齡，從預備役改爲現役，最是表示這個「挺身躍起」「老當益壯」勇猛邁進的精神。在大時代裏，全國國民都應當爲國家出力，盟邦老成宿將的奮起，更足予大束亞戰經的將士們以最大的鼓勵，這個精神上的鼓勵，更足加重全部大東亞民族「敵愾同仇」的心理。大家要覺悟，無論男女老幼，現在正是爲國家出力最好的時機，以整個大東亞民族的力量，去換取整個大東亞民族的獨立，自由，解放，以暫時的痛苦，換取永久的福利，這是現下任何人的職責。</p>
<p>盟邦內閣已改組就緒了，道幾年來，盟邦的政策，眞是刻刻前進，步步奮鬥。對於塞班島事件的公開，毫不諱百，這種精神只是加强人民的信念。對於內閣的改組，毫不躇躊，毅然決然地賞行，這種革新的精神更增加人民的勇氣，一切的一切都表示全國上下，抱定勇猛邁進的精神，向唯一的最後勝利的路上進行。任何苦痛決不能阻止這個決心，任何犧牲決不能消滅堅强的進行。全國人尺只是沉着地等待着最後一擊的機會，這一擊是時時刻刻準備着，進行着，把所有的力量集巾着，蘊藏着，這最後一擊可使英美致命，可使整個大東亞翻身。</p>

<h3>集中力量增產　突入決戰態勢　日中央協力會分部討論</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日本中央協力會議，二十三日之分部討論會第三，第五兩部實，各會員會就目下勤勞動員，生產技術，軍需增產，打開隘路各電要問題，根據個人以往經騐，率眞發表意見，政府則對此特別靈視，屈時亦派員出席，詳細說明政府所見及今後處理方法，殊值期待，茲分誌兩部會情况如下，關於動員學生問題謂：目下非講求工塲設於機構之時期，應捨業一切，突入決戰態勢。今日之學生問題，亦應以學業即勤勞之學勤並重，加以考慮，總之，於今日時局之下，應特別注重勤勞，只有全部集中力量於增產工作，但以大部未能理解現勢，故工塲機構之改善以及整備，迄今尚成問題，但目前爲非常重大時期，學生實不應追求於工塲設施問題。又藤野文部省德務局長對此發表意見謂：動員學生，始終應以國家目的，國家之需要爲前題，努力指導關係入學間題，自明年度文部省將監督高等專門學校之考試計劃，制完學生之現在能力，爲將來進學之標準鍛鍊，尤爲日本敎育之根本，更將注重此點，使爲標準日本國民。關於征用問題，決定產業人員征用辦法，蓋以此爲軍需工作，男女至二十歲後一律施行勤勞檢查，希望編成產業預備軍，更以征用制非僅限於工塲，即礦山亦需施行，故對現有勞務之過當再配置，提出種種意見。又關係女子挺身隊應配爲專門女子指導者，對勞務者發表公司經理內容，最後提出意見，要請組織全日本產學技術者綜合會，以應戰局之需要。第五部會王席爲水野攤氏，席間關於霍需增產，打通隘路，由工塲機機動勞等點，提出種種意見，議員等亦分別發表意見，成以工塲之防空對策未臻完善，於空襲必至之今日，最重要者，　爲工塲之遷移地，機械補充之準備，在動勞觀之而言，企業體制中，自由主義之殘薛，追求利潤之態度，迄今尚存，實屬遣憾。此點則期望軍需省文書課長北野氏澈底督促軍需公司法之施行。</p>
<h3>美對華侵略　野心畢露　華萊士言論堪注目</h3>
<p>中央社訊　華業十於七月九日經加拿大至西雅圖，與美總統羅斯福會談約達二小時之久。查華來士爲羅氏所最信賴之徒，敎其所言，均充分明瞭羅氏之心理。但在本月二十一日美副總統提名時，未受推舉，蓋在羅斯福心目之中，必以華氏可繼，而今此議已成泡影。其問題在於華萊士返國後之如何向羅總統進言，及如何向國民發表。茲特述之如後：華萊士訪渝，目擊當地國民生活狀態與方式後，提議應與美國相同。華氏曾稱，雙方國民生活方式若能一致後，則以中國之靑年與貿易，儘量發展進步，使改變東亞之新天地。視華萊士之發言，可想美對華經濟侵略巳到最後手段·華萊士又稱，「對太平洋沿岸實有開發使其繁榮之必要，蓋西雅圖爲對亞經濟發展是適當之地，並擬擴充華盛頓大舉，以文化向亞洲發展，尤其是美國西岸，已屬極爲發達，現下自應更進一步謀亞洲之發展不可。上述各點若能寶行，則在亞洲能使其對中國及蘇聯之留易更形發達，如此一來，美西部人士即將更臻富裕。蓋目前美國之經濟發展，尙不能言止於極點，自應更進一步向亞洲積極採取經濟之貢獻。華氏且自稱，「余此次訪華時間雖甚短促，目睹中國農工各業不發達之狀態而有斯感。」依上述之言論看來，吾人即可知華萊士之意見，及羅斯福想造成「中國美國化」的野心和米夢了，同時華氏對羅斯福所發表之主論用意，吾人亦可洞悉矣。</p>
<h3>黃軍務司長　抵東京視察</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　國府陸軍軍務司長黃　民，爲渡日視察，業於二十四日下午乘飛機經福岡抵達東京。</p>
<h3>中野任檢事長</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　松阪氏就任法相後，隨即任用大阪控訴院檢事長中等並助氏，爲後任檢事總長。</p>

<h3>大宮島展開夜戰　日守軍予敵重創　迭尼安島敵登陸企圖粉碎</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十四日中央社電　敵天軍對中部太平洋馬里亞納羣島之反攻，自侵佔塞班烏後愈形熾烈，連日反覆轟擊迭尼安，羅特及大宮鳥等地，卒於二十一日來犯八宮烏。二十一日黎明，有敵遝輸船團數十艘，在離厚之海上機動部隊掩護下，靠近大宮島西岸，數十艘舟艇分爲兩路，一路於上午七時二十分，以登陸舟艇百二十艘在明石灣地區登陸，又一路於八時左右，以舟艇二十艘，侵入昭和灣，開始登陸。敵確實兵力尚未判明，據當晚判明者，在明石灣地區美軍兵力爲一師團半，擁有水陸兩用坦克車約百五十輛，昭和灣地區敵兵力亦在半師團以上，擁有坦克車五十輛，總計敵兵力爲兩師團。日海岸守備隊，當在海岸附近邀擊敵軍，僅在昭和灣地區，對於來襲之敵五十輛戰車中擊破其三十輛，此外尚有多數滿載兵員之舟艇，爲日軍擊沉或擊毀，故登產敵軍異常震驚，然敵援軍接踵而至，並對日軍施以猛烈轟擊，故卒未能阻止敵軍登陸。日軍待至日沒，乃對敵登陸地點展開壯烈之大夜襲戰，予以重創，然是役復爲敵優勢火力所阻，終未能迫使敵兵遁至海上，敵遂在兩地區建立微弱之橋頭堡。按敵機動部隊乃於十七日黃昏出現於該烏近海，邇後即對島上施加空前之猛烈轟擊，企圖乘隙登陸，然爲日軍最妙之防禦戰所阻，故延至二十一日始行開始登陸。美太平洋艦隊司令部曾就此次登陸戰門宣稱，登陸前對該烏日軍陣地所作之轟擊，乃太平洋戰爭開始以來最猛烈者，而日軍之抵抗戰，亦愈趨頑强。據敵方後軍記者所傳，敵軍於登陸前所發射之砲彈炸彈量，超過一萬噸，由此可見大宮島日敵爾軍激戰之烈，日軍守備隊士氣益旺，曾於薄幕，夜間，拂曉不斷砲擊，並利用地勢，憑藉原築陣地織續反擊，予以重創。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十四日中央社電敵有力部隊及輸送船團，二十四日晨出現於需里亞納軍島迭尼安爲西南方，此外並備有登陸用舟艇數十隻，企圖於該鳥登陸。斯時，迭尼安之日軍守備嚴，當即開砲猛射，結果敵戰艦一艘及驅逐艦二艘中彈起火燃燒，其登陸用舟艇亦受重創，是故敵之登陸企圖遂被粉碎。</p>
<h3>衡陽攻防戰　日來益形激烈　美機侵入淸遠上空</h3>

<h3>陜縣居民　相繼歸來</h3>
<p>河南陜縣二十四日中央社電　隴海綫要衝陝縣，自劃歸和平區後，業已二月，大部民衆已相繼歸來。按陝縣當五月十八日日軍入城時，據歸還當地之一住民談稱，余對日軍之過情實深感謝云云。渝方對常地每一街巷，每年課以一萬元之重稅。又富地官吏，常違反渝方之命令，禁止製造烟草以得重利，復榨取民衆膏脂，而慶荒淫奢華之生活，故任何居民對渝方咸感不滿，並感痛苦，目下該縣沿術皆張貼中日親善，打倒英美，建設新中國等標一語，又六月一日陝縣治安維持會成立時，爲陝縣建設設而挺身之張先高曾種，迄今常地居民復歸者已達二萬人，此數適當昔日之十分之入，又第一期之居民過鄕工作，已行完畢，刻正努力整備各行政機構</p>
<h3>鄭許等地　開通公路</h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地二十四日中央社電　此次河南作戰之結果，隴海綫西段鄭州至寶鷄之一部，及過去屬於渝方地區，京漢綫南段（黃河南岸至信陽，）已爲日軍佔領。此二大交通路沿機各都市，巳脫離七年來於渝政權下之重壓，而重現光明。今後新河南之建設，首須建設交通動脈之公路。目前鄭州南方許昌附近之村鎮民衆，連日來均手持鐵鍬，致力於修築道路之工作，如公路完成後，則物資當可自由運輸。同時對於確保治安上，亦有莫大實獻。按鄭州之陷落時期，爲四月二十日，許昌爲五月一日，郾城爲五月五日，洛陽爲五月二十五日，故復興狀况，以鄭州爲最佳，於七月已設立電報局郵局。又各地於日軍入城後，均先後成立治安維持會，建設委員會，商務會，幷立即開始正式活動，故目前河南，已邁上建設之途云。</p>

<h3>瑞國防部長　警告國人</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊；瑞典國防部長發表演說警告國人，謂戰爭之危險刻已愈迫近瑞典，倘反軸心軍北攻，則瑞典必劃人危險地區，由東方而來之危險似亦已漸迫近，然組敢侵犯瑞典自由者，必付重大之代價，蓋數年來瑞典之軍隊實力已大增強也</p>
<h3>土耳其受壓迫　採遷延方策</h3>
<p>布達佩斯二十四日中央社電　美英蘇三國對土耳其歷三週之壓迫，結局仍未得結論。土政府之遷延方策已成功。土國會突然聲明自二十八日起休曾兩星期，產拉卓格魯首相及德駐土大使巴本並其他軸心國外交團，亦均赴君士坦丁避署。又據安加拉訊，關於土耳其之態度，曾舉出下十列各點：　土政府巧妙利用英美與蘇聯間之利害衝突。　暫觀全戰局，特別巴爾幹情勢，其軍事已行支配政治。　防備資材之不足，已使美英兩國軍事委員了解。　德使巴本警告土國，提供敵方基地與准許以其他軍事便宜之一切行動，當爲敵對行爲，此舉已發揮極大效力。觀以上情形，現在土政府之中心問題，即達靼尼爾海峽之防衛已趨嚴實，對軸心陣營雖有支持態度，然對英美兩國仍行要求供給武器，同時更對英美蘇三國提出保障土耳其地位之提議，作爲補足德黑蘭會議之決定事項，而出以一流之遷延作戰。此外重大問題，乃爲蘇聯政府對巴爾幹於于政治軍事兩面將取如何對策。目下安加拉政界之蘇聯接近派已行抬頭，而有由根本推翻英國第一主義之傾向，國繞土耳其之英蘇兩國外交戰，刻已達到沸點。現在土耳其國參戰氣勢遂漸濃厚，因土政府對英美蘇之要求逐次讓步，故對軸心斷委等，最近頗有實現之可能。</p>
<h3>英相邱吉爾　自前綫歸國</h3>

<h3>密芝那戰況　敵宣傳矛盾</h3>
<p>北緬前綫二十四日中央社電　上月初旬敵方廣播曾謂，密芝那市街業為渝英美聯軍佔領，刻尙作掃蕩戰，然於該月十旬復謂，渝英美聯軍目下在飛機掩護下，縮小對密芝那之包圍陣，暴露其宣傳佔領密芝那之矛眉。本月又廣播謂，聯軍機塲因遭日軍攻擊，損失甚重，承認日軍之勇敢如斯，敵軍未能奪取密芝那自甚顯然。同時敵方更自已暴露其於該市周邊之苦戰情形，蓋敵我兩軍於該市周邊連日激戰，乃為事實。</p>
<h3>蘇軍先頭部隊　抵林堡外圍　另一部隊向森河推進</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蘇軍之先頭進攻部隊，蒙受慘重之損失後，已於昨日抵達林堡（Lemberg，一名勒伏甫Lvov）之外園，林堡西北之蘇軍部隊向森（San）河推進，已到達布格Bug）河上游西方之羅勃林（Rublin），有力德軍與蘇軍隨處激戰，一部戰綫已陷於混亂。中部地區之德軍守備隊與蘇軍激戰後，已將勃萊斯特里托夫斯克至格羅特諾戰綫蘇軍之淮攻阻止，封閉蘇軍之局部突出部。格羅特諾西北之德軍，曾猛烈反攻，驅使蘇軍東退，考納斯實北之德軍，亦過阻蘇軍之進攻。</p>

<h3>芬蘭前綫　戰事停頓</h3>
<p>赫爾辛基二十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：「鳥西蘇米報」今日撰文稱，芬蘭前繞戰事之停疑，乃防禦勝利之特徵，德國在經濟與軍事上對我人之協助，足以增加我人順利抵抗之可能，此種協助加强我單之自倌力，蓋因我軍已獲得作戰之新工具，與爲自由而作戰之新動力。該報續稱，蘇軍將發動新攻勢，固無疑問，但有利之防禦可能與芬軍堅決之作戰精神，保證敵將遭遇更强之抵抗。</p>
<h3>德調後備兵增援　北法大戰將爆發　為調整陣綫德軍撤離聖安特</h3>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電　德國新開社訊，軍息：德軍已充分利用侵歐戰區近日來之沉寂，已將後備兵輸至前綫，以便對奧納河以東顯欲發動大規模攻勢之鄧普賽將軍所部英軍增强抵抗寶力，聞英軍於該處結集十師團，其中並包括坦克車師團。</p>
<p>柏林二十四日中央社電訊：鄧普賽將軍已得新銳及軍火之補完，一俟天氣總佳之後，英軍當將向侵歐前錢東部重施進攻，英軍補充後之兵力今已與上週二向奧納迤東發動攻勢時之兵力不相上下。最近二十四小時內所發生之局部戰事，似有形成戰事重心之勢，英軍企岡向瑪爾托退進，尤欲奪取第七十二高崗聖安特及聖瑪丁二村。英軍東翼傳曾向特洛安及該處東西二翼德軍陣綫猛施砲轟，觀其行動似將以特洛安及克恩西南區域爲其下次攻勢之目標。最近數日侵歐前綫東部德軍較爲沉寂，蓋在利用此時機調集增援及穩定所守陣地，故已放棄聖安特村，改守瑪爾托迤南之新陣地。美軍在桑洛與比里埃之問砲轟猛烈，似有發動新進攻之模樣。勃拉特萊將軍顯巳調到新軍準備進攻，德軍今已在該處採取應付對策，美軍在拉姆本附近迄未能有何進展。</p>

<h3>科學技術座談會</h3>
<p>記者：今天的座談會，是定布望諸位，各就所長，指敎科學技術戰力化的問題，也就是科學技術能成爲生產技術的各種問題。談到科學技術生產化，最主要者，就是政府當局所熱心考慮中的科學動員，所以就請技術院的花田課長先就現狀指示一二。</p>
<p>由科學技術審議會至研究動員會議</p>
<p>花田：技術院成立，而科學技術這一名詞也產生了。技術院的成立，和科學技術這一各詞的廣汛應用，是同一時期。由於這種諭調和空氣的日漸濃厚，所以才由去年正月成立了科學技術審議會，這是對於政府供獻意見的一個討論重耍科學技術問題的諮詢機關。去年十一月成立了研究動員會議，其重要研究事項，就是以增强戰力爲目標，而實行國家總動員的。這種組織的成立，是與各種政府組織的改變相配合。固然，大家都抱有爲國盡忠的心願，而積極勞動着，但由於只保持着連絡，所以並無任何進展。現在的研究動員會議，是把全國內這類零亂組織，綜合起來，構成一個中央集權的統一形式。假如運用靈活，我們都相信是會有奇蹟出現的。只是研究這個名詞，是會給他人一種出世之感，因而誤會研究這一名詞的意義，以爲戰爭到了這樣劇烈的地步，反有空閑去慢慢研究。發生誤會，是一件塲事，本來研究這句話，全體國民都瞭解這是身傍的事，所以說，日常生活就是研究，也正如儒敎所說，「道不必達求」，假如都能這這樣上了軌道，則日本的研究力就會發揮最大效力。所以這樣的研究，戰局愈嚴重而愈需要，同時研究的內容，也必然隨着時局而演變的。十年前開始的工作，而現在葉而不顧者，逐漸減少起來，然而一般的根本精神，却是未變。只是表現形式，有了很多的變化。方才所說，中央集權體制業已成立？然而運並非指一切而言。旣然目前研究動員會議的體制鐵已成立，那末全國就會受到統制，這話是不盡然的。按研究的內容，按研究的範國，當然組織是分好多階段的。假如適應這樣的形式和各種研究之各種組織，能圓滑還用，則全國的機構，就會稱心如意。我認爲是道樣的。</p>
<p>研究動員的一元化</p>
<p>龍者：在文部省內，成立了學術研究會幾科學動員特別委員會，然而與研究動員會議，是各自爲政，而有二元性的。好像有使之一元化的必要，這究竟是指那一方面而說的呢？</p>
<p>花田：這就是當國家出題研究時，當然就需要承受這個問題的。假如社會內一無所有，無論怎樣要求，也是得不到東西的。當國家命令作某種研究時，當然就有那種研究的人，和那種研究的組織。其中主要者，就是研究動員會議所處理的形式，在這一點上，自然是有關聯性的。</p>
<p>稻村：這是報導界的錯誤。文部省的學術研究會議科學動員特別委員會的目的，與研究動員會議的目的，二者是有絕然不同的性格。如說這是對建性的宗派組織，或說這是科學與按術的對立，這就大錯而特錯了，實際上毫無衝突之點。假如一個研究員，如接到研究動員會議的戰時研究員的任命，同時又是學術研究會議的研究班員時，自然必須要首先接受戰時研究員的任命，而辭掉學術研究會員。研究動員會議，是非當優秀的研究動員制度，按必要的任務，而物色最答適的人爲戰時研究主任，其下則附有戰時研究員數人，組成研究班，而實行寗缺無濫主義。只是動員眞正能担負起任務來的人，而是盡量動員資材與人員的。固然，每一個人都想替國家效力，但是使用資材與勞力或有浪費，所以動員所有的科學家和技術家，在形式上看或許很好，然而在寶踐上却有許多不便，所以不道樣作。對於現實上的一個研究課題，凡有能力解決者，才能採用，這種研究動員的形式，我認爲比德國，法國，美國等的科學動員，還高勝一籌。研究動員會議，是有重點的，也是部份的；而學術研究會議，則是普）遍的。前者是直接以戰時研究爲目標，後者是以研究戰力增强爲目的。</p>
<p>研究動員體制與科學技術總動員</p>
<p>稻村：研究動員體制，雖然業已完全就緒，然而科學技術總動員尚未有眉目，道是我認爲遺憾的。總之，綜合日本科學家和技術家全部的力最，以統一的形式，形成戰力化，這一點我認爲還有一個問題，就是學界協會更進一步改組的問題。此外，文部省的學術研究會議旣是隸屬於文部省的機關，所以對於不屬於研究動員會議的各省研究機關，以及民間研究所，再加以組織化，使之走向生產方面，作提高生產用，同時科學按術問題，也必須使之組織化，合理化。現在一般人都說高速度生產，即假如打算以極短暫的時間，完成高性能的機械和材料，就必需速度。耍想達到（道種情形，就必須把前此研究機關的規種，還要擴大十倍以上。我認爲現在的任務，就是採取這一方法。</p>
<p>花田：我認爲即將順序走向這一方向。例如說試騐金屬疲勞，就有試騐疲勞的工作。所謂試騐疲勞，是有非常多的試騐疲勞機，而試騐疲勞，當然是需要相當時間的。因此，假如在十個地方研究十個疲勞試騐問題，假設需耍一年期間的話，則一年後一下可得出十個答案來，然而假如一個人作的話，則需要十年。假如綜合起來作，每月作一個，而一年後就完成十二個。因此，頭一個問題，一個月就可以得出答案來。這樣一來，一年後固然得出相同的答案來，但看一看中途的階段時，就往往藉此而解決很多問題。這固然是一個極端的例證，然而這一類的事情，非全國用中央集權的方法，綜合起來作，是不行的。</p>
<p>稻村：再舉一個具體的實例來看。在研究家方面，有日本學術振興會的小委員會，此外還有全國技術聯盟的研究隣組，或各種學術協會的專門委員會等，現在都有了相當有力的體制，與以前迴乎不同，而採用集體方法了。現在的傾向是不斤斤於自己創意權和優先權等問題上了。這樣的委員會或隣組，使其調整的機關，無論在文部省，也無論在技術院，似乎尚未成立，不知是否對？總而言之，我認爲對於學會和協會的動員，尚未實行。縱令對於個人的動員，或對於私人研究家的動員，無論怎樣實行，然而對於學會和協會這樣集團的動員，尚未着手，這不能不說是一個遺憾</p>
<p>花田：我認爲研究動員會議就是這樣產生和成長的。雖說是一個理想制度，但立刻今天是不能成理想制度的。假如不顧過去的事實，當然就會發生毛病的，旣未發生毛病，而又自然而然地發展下去，這或許就是最好的方法。只是速度方面不能盡量求快，這是按事實說，假如速度太快，如後面的新者尚未產生，而舊者業己全部破壞，於是就會發生毛病的。</p>
<p>稻村：軍需省業已成立，前此我謂統制會的使命，完全已經擔負起來，於是統制會就不能不具有另外新的性格，科學技術研究方面，我認爲也需要一個執行這個統制會任務的强力的，如按總動員法成立的動令團體之類。現在科學動員協會方面，完全與科學動員不發生關係了，且全國科學技術聯合會這個團體，並沒有乘受這一點的力量。在某種程度上能承受政府權限的委託而勞動，所以可以說，這是產業方面的統制會。在這個組織裏，要加入五六個專任科學家和技術家，我認爲現在是需要這樣機構的。</p>
<p>花田：我們今天所有機構的有生機部份，盡量扶植起來·這雖說是理想，然而按情形，或許必須產生新組織，然而所謂一定產生新組織，於是就必須通過許多不合理的事情，所以，只是要盡量避免不台理而作的。然而或許不能不發生不合理的現象</p>
<p>稻村：總而言誓之，以現在所有者爲基礎，而盡量培植其力量，共同一致地從事本位職務</p>
<p>花田：是正計劃共同一致地從事本位職務的。</p>
<p>研究成果生產化過程</p>
<p>記者：我不知這前後的次序，試問研究室裹的研究成果，在生產化過程上，工業化過程上，有什麼問題呢？關於這一點，請備滕先生指敎一二。</p>
<p>備藤：是研究的成果麼？</p>
<p>記者：是成果達到實際工業化，或產業化的過程。是經過怎樣的過程，而達到這個地步呢？</p>
<p>備藤：按過過去的方法，是必須估計一下是否合算，而後才辦理的，然而現在我們統制會內所辦理的事象，假如是對工作有好處的發明，或是研究結果一發表，立刻就搬到工塲去，進行生產化。所以最近報紙上每天大書而特書的許多問題之一，所謂戰時型的機機問題，假如一研究好，立刻就要實際化的，於是就呈現出需要解決這一希望的必要課題來，就是說，給與一個題目，命令在何日何時研究出來，具體化後，立刻命令利用於生產上。當試騐完成後，即移到生產上去。我們的工作是非常迫切的工作，所以必須要考慮到時間因素，除掉時間是不行的，無論什麼研究，無論什麼工作，都和時間有關聯的。然而這是在受極大限制的時間內作的方法。例如此次對於飛機增加生產的揹置，曾經事前把目的，即所希望的題目，必須在某時完成。例如至何日何時實現，而交與生產機關這個問題，常準備期間時，就早已規定出來何時必須完成設計，何時必須完成試騐，於是就在某一期間內，不分晝夜的積極工作。</p>
<p>記者：這樣說來，使科學技術企業化，就是研究課題的內容羅！（未完）（季譯自四月號日本評論）</p>

<h3>第一警察局　推進防犯工作　招待新聞界闡明防犯意義</h3>
<p>本市第一警察局司法處，近為防止犯罪，澄淸社會罪惡，以確保治安，協力大上海之建設，特設置防犯科，以達成此項意義深長之理想。該處長李時雨氏，因鑒於防犯工作在我國尚屬初創，一般人民均無深切瞭解，亟需以宜傳力量，使社會各階層對防犯意義澈底明暸，一致協力，同時更期由新聞界人士，協力推行工作，特於昨日下午四時，假都城飯店二樓招待本市新聞界舉行茶會，計到本市新聞界代表陳彬龢·程仲權·魯風等四十餘人，李司法處畏，菅賢副處長，及防犯科石科畏等，親予招待，席間曾由李司法處長管賢副處長，相繼致詞，闡明防犯意義，繼由陳彬龢，魯風代表新聞界致詞。茲將原文誌錄於後：</p>
<p>李處長詞</p>
<p>李處長目稱：未日天氣炎熱，辱承各位先生光臨指教，殊屬榮幸，本人於上海租界收回後，擔任警察司法工作，與社會各階層發生密切關係，本擬早日向諸位請教，因種種關係，遷延迄今，始舉行簡單茶會招待各位，深感抱歡。此次警察當局發動防犯工作，有向新聞界同志報告之必要，及請求諸位協力之必要，惟在未談如何協力之前，顧將防犯工作作一簡單報告。關於防犯工作之意義及展望，本人日前曾有廣播發表，不必贅述。惟防犯問題之起綠，由於本人前在司法界服務，去年擔任警察司法後，曾對犯罪及刑罰　　予以研究，刑罰之目的，固亦在防止犯罪，但巳由過去報復或鎭　主義進化為感化主義，等於病人服藥治療，但吾人若於未病時而預防，則豈不更妙。故吾人決心以新的方式，達到防犯目的，以减少犯罪，同時犯罪及社會病態，犯罪增加予社會以不良影響，欲使社會走上正軌，必先遵守種種法則，使其正常發展。租界接收以來，本人擔任司法警察職務後，曾發現種種不正常現象，所謂刑罰僅加於小民，眞正罪大惡極者，反逍遙法外，社會道德淪落，無法無天，連空處的通德，亦告破產。但執法者本身亦不能十分健全，蓋過去捕房時代之包探，受理境包圍，而人民缺乏法律知識，於是行賄受賄，稍有節操者，亦為引誘，故實在需要控制力量，以社會各階層的力量，實行防犯工作。至防犯工作之目的，大而言之，使國家政治上軌道，應行法治，在司法警察之立塲，即聯合各階層人民組織起來，合理的使犯罪减少，以至消滅。關於防犯方法，除調查組織訓線外，最重要者厥為宣傳，新聞界係民衆國家喉舌，能發揮與論力量，防止犯罪，期望新聞界同志，站在正義立塲，使一般人民知法守法，幷指示社會制裁罪惡，使人欲為惡而不能，一面予以感化，聯合同志擔任防犯之一員，對防犯工作協力指導，本人決如陳市長所昭示「好的，決心去幹，不好的，決心不去幹」的精神，與各位共同努力。</p>

<p>司法處副處長管賢二郎氏致詞謂：上海為東方之中國都市，在世界上頗負盛名，關於犯罪方面，在世界都市間，頗難避免，故在世界的形式上，以重視政治經濟為多，而上海方而，無論在建設及設備上，在東方則為首屈上指，具此優越之條件下，犯罪當難避免。深信其原因，　人民對警察之不協力，　過去由於租界之存在，人民不願忍受壓制，而造成的犯罪行為。查往昔英國採取高壓政策，迨去年八月一日，國府接收租界後，中間法權乃達到每一中國人民，予以保護予以制裁，故不得不有澈底改革的必要，以採用新的法律政策。關於防犯工作之性質，譬諸猶未患病之市民，不使有疾，過去的現象，乃為已經有病之民，開方治療，該項預防工作的效果，在例十上言，在夏季防止虎列拉之發生，制裁方面，則射施預件針苗。故上海防疫工作開始時，當初有少數中國民衆不瞭解日本之誠意，引起無稽之流言，此項反應，在防犯工作之開始時，恐將難免有無聊之刺激，僅待防犯工作達於頂羅時，則一般人民定為感謝於當局。在於前者，不得不仰賴輿論之鼓吹及指摘力量，期使各方深切瞭解，深望在座報道諸君鼎力協助，多多愛護，此點本處深為期望者。繼由本報社長陳彬龢致詞，見本日本報代評欄。末由李處長及副處長分別表示採納意見，使之確切糾正。至望新聞界以輿論的協力，澈底消滅特別形態。再有魯風堯濟川等發表防止犯罪意見，詳加商討，至六時許始散。</p>
<h3>日內閣更迭　國家意旨不變　松平部長駁斥英美讕言</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，於昨（二十四）日下午二時半，循例假南京路外灘華懋飯店八棋舉行報道常會，大使館方面計到松平情報部長，福間副領事，暨本市中國各報社記者，即席由松平情報部長，就最近日本新內閣組成，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>根本不能理解</p>
<p>松平情報部長謂，最近日本成立新內閣，竟又為英美方面不惜妄加推測，作無聊　言的材料，濫施技倆。查過去英美一般人民，對日本認識淺薄，彼輩的日本觀念，且恆有謬誤，其原因實由於英美政治家，無論在學校教育上，社會教育上，凡關於中日兩國及東亞其他各國之關係，以及柬亞各民族的感想和希望，始終不願使本國民衆與問其間，因此一般人民對東亞之認識，根本毫無理解。在五十四年前的日本，所頒布憲法採用代議士制度，距今十年之前，又修正代議士制度，以成為新的形態制度，是那日本最良好之制度，蓋日本曠古以來之政治泉源，在明治維新以後，以更進一步的明確發動，全國國民以皇帝為中心團結鞏固，故內閣之有無變動，絕不變易國家意旨。是故英美人對日本之認識，殊難以明瞭。</p>
<p>打擊英美野心</p>
<p>松平部長繼謂：今次新內閣成立後，小磯內閣總理暨諸大臣披瀝意見，頗為明切，軍官民一致以皇室為中心，故日本全國朝野，全力以赴，為防止英美兩國重返東亞，力求解放大東亞，以基於國家平衡的新秩序。此項最有意義的，即重光外相兼任大東亞相。重光外相主張之大東亞解放的理念，不但在於柬亞各國所要求之人類進化及發展之大道，並將此項原案謀全世界人類切實理解，意義殊為深湛。查該項原理，在英美智識階級瞭解者亦有，如威爾基及林白等等，另有一部份領導階級者，固亦不乏一知半解之流，基其原因，乃不忍干涉東亞之發展，但彼輩由於利己之立塲上，絕不願柬亞民族之發展，故英美此項態度，我人唯有嚴厲予以打擎到底，使彼單深受莫大之痛苦，是為大東亞解放的前程倏件。</p>
<h3>防空警報常識</h3>
<p>警　警報　汽笛長聲連鳴二分鐘</p>
<p>空襲警報　汽笛短聲連鳴七聲或七聲以上每聲五秒</p>
<p>警報解除　汽笛長聲連鳴二聲每聲十五秒</p>
<h3>經濟局限令　各公會獻鐵</h3>
<p>市經濟局為勸導各同業公會捐獻廢鐵，前由該局局長徐大深將私邸中廢鐵首先捐獻，以為表率，是以各公會相繼踴躍　納，成績優良，茲以有少數公會尚未呈報，該局特令飭各該公會，限三日內將所屬各會員捐獻廢鐵總數呈報，以便派員檢點查收</p>
<h3>麵製熟食業公會　實部令解散</h3>
<p>自政府當局實施戰時物資統制政策後，對於主要商品同業公會，即積極　整，具組織不健全之公會，絕對從事改善機十稱，或予解散停止活動，以期協力物資統制任務，收其實效，茲悉本市麵製熟食業同業公會，前因會員業別廣泛，種類產一，　經當局着其分別造報，靜候處理，現聞實業部據報後，對該公會業務，旣與其他麵製品業抵觸，且組織又不健全，內容腐敗，故特以商字二四五一號指令本市糧食局，將麵製熟食業工會應准即予解散，幷將主要業務，倂八各有關飭主管科道照辦理，按該公會負責人王秉　子泉等，藉職務上便利，犯有浮收舞弊情事，迄今在地檢署　押。</p>
<p>代評</p>
<h3>防犯工作</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>——在司法處茶會席上致詞</p>
<p>上海是罪惡的淵　，最大的原因，一般聞人—又稱大亭—具有特殊心理。他們一方面犯罪，一方面却以不受法律制裁，引以為榮耀。以致法律失去制裁力量，甚且法律不能保障人民，反利用之以欺騙人民，壓迫人民。在這種社會情况下，自然漸成為罪惡之淵藪了。</p>
<p>過去巡捕房司法部分的行動，最為黑暗，而人民最覺害怕。自從租界接收以後，經過警察司法當局的努力，逐步革新，漸入正軌。這是很欣幸的。可是，各分局關於警察司法，還不能盡滿人意。過去巡捕房的惡習尚未澈改，希望當局編續努力。</p>
<p>至於防犯工作，比較更有積極意義，從此社會能得安定，犯罪事件减少。我們辦報的目標，實有一部分相同。所以，我們極願協力推行，使市民了解。各局司法部分整理改革的實况，與過去巡捕房不同者，應將革新之點及不同之點盡量在報紙發表，不然，人民還是未曾了解的。</p>
<p>現在警察局司法範圍內組織防犯科，我們認為主要的對於聞入大亭之流，從事囤積投機暴利者，應以大無畏精神施以法律制裁。否則，一切改革防犯是無效果的。</p>

<h3>民間防空映唱大會　昨晚熱烈舉行　參加民衆達五萬餘人</h3>
<p>本市市民防空本部，為發揚民問防察意志，及灌輸民衆防空智識起見，特於昨（二十四）晚八時半在靜安寺路跑馬廳中央廣塲舉行「民肪空映唱大會」，免費公開招待民衆參觀，到有該部主任秘書孫理甫及各有關當局長官等，及民衆達五萬餘人，情况空前熟烈。先由上海交響音樂團演奏序曲，及艱舞曲，旋由孫主任秘書致辭，略謂：「防空本部此次舉行民防空映唱大會」，承蒙各界光臨，深表謝意。今日上海己非安樂土，上海雖離戰塲亦不不為遠，敵人之突襲必來，為無可避免之事，防空工作，非僅防空本部幹部人員即能擔負此責，必須賴上海全市民共同協力，作萬全之防空準備，以保衛上海」云云。詞畢開峽新聞片及文化片，及市民防空影片第一輯，隨後由梁樂音指導黎樂鳴唱大上海防空歌，旋由影星歌唱，谷鶯唱「討厭的早晨」，吳詠唱「不變的心」，梁萍唱「戒烟歌」，張暉張羽黃志光及歐陽飛鶯吳詠梁萍六人合唱「大上海防空歌」，全塲情緒甚為緊張，至干時許始散。</p>
<h3>棉花配給價格　呈院核示</h3>
<p>商統會棉業統制委員會改組成立後，對於棉業統制整個方案，（如棉花收買配給，棉製品集中生產，與棉製品收配等營運事務，）已經研究，擬具草案，那將呈部院覆核，確定實施。茲悉該會於去年冬開始在上海·南京·無錫·海門·南通·啓東·東台·合與鎭·安慶·杭州·寧波等十一區，收買棉花，迄今已有相當成民需，所有棉花配給價格，業己確定，正呈請行政院核准實行中，關於本年新棉花收買價格，該會將於下月中着召集有關各方面，討論合理之收買價格，以適合農民生活實情為標準。</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討　各地囤積米糧的眞相</h3>
<p>不僅在上海，在各地區米糧的囤積，也已經大衆化了。在上海，囤積米糧不算是不合法的行動，市政府的臨時食米辦法，已加以合法的承認。即設　搬人口以後，除米統會的徽購以外，曾由市政府收買米糧以配給一般市民，但允許市民可以貯藏三個月的米糧。不受市政府與米統會認可與否，米商的從事國積，及一般市民的囤積所藏，在現在米價變勁的情形下，大約是不可避的，但這種大衆的囤積，究竟有何意義呢？几是有資力者，在不再漲過於此的米價中，囤積了十二分的米糧，而無資力者，則不能不陸續購賈一天一天漲起來的米糧。這情形就是說，最因米價貴而苦惱的階層，不能不陸續購買高價米；反之像他們不因米價貴而苦惱的階層，則能大量購入較廉的米。無資力者被迫於不國積不能活的生活上的必要，乃用下面的方法國積。</p>
<p>即搜集所有的資金，購買米糧，而將其大部份轉賣於他人，以其一部分供一定期問自用。他們用轉賣所得的利潤，購備因此一轉手而較便宜的米。</p>
<p>要想明瞭運當中情形的人，袛要到上海軍站去霸爭尚米販購米的米販　。在這種情形下，縱令上海的食米搬人量增加了若干，米價亦難曇落。在因地，限制每一民衆的購久糧，並強化麵粉的配給，均已開始付之實施。但這不過是一時購買大量的米，與分數次購買少量的米之不同而已。防止一有錢即換米的大衆的囤積之深刻化，是最必要而極困難的問題。於是米價遂日趨狂漲。</p>
<p>今後囤積對策</p>
<p>今後的囤積對策，應立即檢舉並處斷奸商，自不待說。但對於囤積必要量以上的食米者，則不能不實施食米的均需化政策。善良的農民，不許其因自已耕作的緣故而不販賣食米，囤積的大衆，亦完全不能有因為是自已的錢的緣故而得無限制購入食米的資格。經濟當局應速即檢舉米糧囤積。應於最短期間在全市普遍檢舉眞正意義的囤積奸商，產米地正在檢查並登記食米的時候，投機囤積的基地上海，無理由不實因行上述對策。又上海特設特別法庭的分庭，米糧投機囤積者，一律付常堂判決，毫無例外的執行死刑。當檢舉米糧投機者時，不要如檢舉金條時一樣，大多數無罪釋放，而從速調查其罪行，以之為民生的蟊賊，要求付之槍決處分，（全文完）（譯自六月二十入日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>挽救破碎的農村</h3>
<p>— 雨順</p>
<p>際此食米問題日趨嚴重的當見，讓我來報告一些某產米區的農村情形：</p>
<p>增產的呼聲，固然　遍了知識界，可是增產運動在農業方面　未產生效力，農民依然應用上代傳下來的老方法，去種植五　。由於肥料缺乏，害蟲猖獗，地方不實等減產因素的作祟，非但保持原有產量，已非易事，抑且逐漸湖海的趨勢。</p>
<p>目前養一頭豬要五六千元的資本，一般農民早已　吃　糧，自無這樣大的資本來養豬，於是農田最需的肥料——「豬　」，就沒有了來處。至於豆餅，價格那　貴得驚人，當然更其買不起。因此不得不卷水草和粑河泥來充任肥料，然而往往有人無船。即使有人有船，因卷水草和耙河泥的農民，人數較前激增，草也不易　到，泥也不易耙　，肥料缺乏，田禾不營養不足。再者，農村中耕牛奇缺，往往數家合用一頭，以致　；田打水，每　及時行之，延遲了種秧日期，由禾先天不足，早已造成。又去秋已螟蟲為患，出於去冬沒有大冷，今夏螟蟲益加猖獗，現在「抽心死」的災象，甚為嚴重，但未見當局倡導除螟，而農民僅以「天意」視之，無所舉動。大家想，在這種局面下，米毅的收成，怎樣會不減色呢？</p>
<p>農民辛苦地收到了些米　，為了　需現款，去繳付田租，清償債務，應付捐稅，願不得新　登場期慘跌的米價，儘量地把所得的米，在米商殺價的聲勢下，去換取取幣。</p>
<p>米價越低，　好艱得愈多，為救燃眉之急。甚至連日已應該保存的食米也　出去。即使有一部分比較精明的農民，想避免米商的殺價，慢慢地把米出售，希望多换點鈔票，可是　實告訴她們，一旦當局開始收買食米，即在一　縣區之内，米　亦絕對　止移動的（依法不如此，事實却如此），於是　得忍痛出售。</p>
<p>農民應依照當局规定的價格，繳出一定数量的食米，富於服從性的我國農民，縱然明知自已所需的食米還不够，仍舊把應繳的食米，運交指定的收　機關。當拿到了較　給米商更少的现鈔的時候。常似笑非笑地說：「他們出低價錢買我們的米，　他們亦以低價錢，把農具豆餅棉布肥皂火柴糖賣給我們」。</p>
<p>在以前太平時代，一股農民早已入不敷出，促　見肘。现在耕種田數未增，收成减色，在米商殺價收買和當局平價收買之下，貨幣的收入，益加不足應付必需的貨幣的支出。何况目前每家農民人口較前增加，额外捐稅較前繁多，日用品之價格飛漲，農民支出增加的倍數，超過了收入增加的倍数。不知幾許。當青黄不接之際，贫窮的農民，家無隔宿之糧，為苟延残喘，不得不借錢或借米，銀行錢莊似乎不以農民為顧客的，所以農民祇得出月息百分之百到三百的高利率，向當地高利貸者，　求借錢，再以較　出時高出數錯的價錢，去　入　需的米糧，像今年他們以每石几千元的高價。去買他們曾於去冬以每石九百元賣出的食米。誠者向當地有餘米者借米，在陽　六七月裏借一石米，到新　登場後，须還一石五斗米。這樣，農民自然越弄越窮</p>
<p>農村的破碎情形，當非一二千字所能道　，即使細細地描寫出來，除非親歷其境，否则，决不會相信世界上竞有如此痛苦的事實。農村破碎行如此，食米安能免於成為嚴重問題的中心呢！</p>
<p>我們認為解决都市民食的根本辦法，還是農業增產；至於改良收買方法和配給制度，僅是治標之計。所以我們希望：（一）農業增產運動的主持者和贊助者，快快起而行，不僅坐而管，迅即動員農業專家和學生，指尋農民改良耕種方法。（二）建立農村金融機搆，使農民以低利通资金，不再受高利贷者的剝削，都市遊資，或亦可藉此流入正途。（三）當局收買米糧，最好採取預付米款制度，於青黃不接之時，農民最需現金之際，预付米款之一部成全部舆農民，調　農民收人之季節性。使農民不再仰高利貸者的鼻息。如此，農民必更願意聽從政府的命令，依照规定的價格，出售其所收的米　。</p>
<p>建議廢券貼花</p>
<h3>補助教育基金</h3>
<p>— 陳其雄</p>
<p>國人教育不普及，國家之富强亦難想像，而今教育當局經費支絀，教界待遇菲薄，影響教育前途至深且巨，爰有廢卷貼花補助教育基之商權，茲備述理由於後</p>
<p>（理由）法幣一度在市面流通之後，不免破損而由國家銀行收回，廢券即係指破損卷收回後不復發行，而加銷燬之謂。其數量之大，實堪驚人，向為外界所不察者，日有數十萬元。故實行　卷貼花後。該項稅收，亦必可觀。现在情勢下供作教育基金，頗為切要。按紙賞鈔卷一經使用，難免撕破污損及鼠咬火　蟲蛀等情發生，平時在规定範圍以內，向國家銀行嫵限止掉換新幣，例不收取任何費用，極稱便利，故一般使用者習以不察，將所持法幣任情放置，以致易於破损或故意破損，殊　可惜。惟向無明文规定愛用辦法，而今印刷成本較前昂貴，蓋破損券之消費亦為財政上一大支出，而来當非為國民之负担，故持有破損券者，應完納相當之印花税，實贴於破損券上，否則國家銀行不予兌換，商店不予收用，限以非貼不可。果能照此辦理，非獨鈔券之損失必能減少，而持卷人必知加以愛護，財政上亦可少一筆支出，個人持有破損卷其數極微，應納之稅不致影響個人經濟，一舉而數得，務希舆論界注意而提倡矣。</p>
<p>玆將　行商榷之點，列後而供參考。</p>
<p>（一）貼花：抑用原來印花稅或另外設計。</p>
<p>（一）稅率：贴花當以票面額大小而定，於其基數如何定法。</p>
<p>（一）效用：貼花後之破損券要否在市上流通。</p>
<p>（一）交解：整批破損卷收受行莊如何測知完全贴花舆否。</p>
<p>（一）實施：本辦法擬就後應由何人呈請主管宫署核准施行。</p>
<p>社會服務</p>
<h3>義務感化戒煙所　首批受戒者出所　第二期開始申請登記</h3>
<p>南通路　裕裏中教道義會，附設之感化臨時義務戒煙所，第一批受戒人十餘名，經該會所聘醫師揚　文。孫為瑞。蔡達明等掛心診治，注射華生藥物研究所出品之「聖康毒平」針劑，並視各人所患　疾，隨時予以各種補助藥品，施戒以來，經過均極良好。不特煙　斷絕，抑且恢復健康，藥於昨日平安出所。該會為表示鄭重起風，先期通知保證人，帶領受戒人一同出所，並經　主教及楊孫兩主任與來賓三十餘人，共同　化，受戒人均欣然接受，禮成而散。聞第二期義務戒煙，現已開始登記，凡　職業青年，染有煙癮無力施減者，可就近向本處或南通路豐裕裏該會申請登記</p>
<h3>本處發售　兩大善書</h3>
<p>保富法一文，孫　　　居士，病中傑作，寓意深切，足以　　人心。去　刊印單行本，風行一時，初版　已售　，茲已再版出書，每冊書成本十元，收入悉充濟貧金之用。</p>
<p>外世明燈，一名感應篇白話貫珠解。感應篇為我國勸善最古之書，自晉唐以來，上自公　下至婦孺，普遍流傳。所舉諸惡　善，不下百數十條，誠趨吉避凶之妙典，亦亂世適用之奇書。</p>
<p>今應用貫珠方法，出以流暢白話，將原文與解釋，融成一份，編法新穎，含義顯明，係樂中印書會所印行，本處亦有發售，每冊　五元。</p>
<h3>彌月賀犧助產</h3>
<p>朱昌禮先生，昨以令郎彌月，不願有所鋪張，特將親友賀儀，並即省湯餅　資，除損贈助學金二千元外，複捐本處助產金一千元。朱君熱心公益，彌足感佩，敬代受惠產婦，致其謝忱。</p>
<p>又金記上次會將其所得二月份補助費，捐助本處小本貸金，今複承捐贈三月份補助費八十元，　惠窮乏，彌深感謝。</p>
<h3>學生站崗問題</h3>
<p>近來聯保處，對學生自　團站崗，總派在上課時間？雖經數度請求，　無效果。保長總是說：「對不起，已派定貴公子了，沒有法子，通融了你，別人是要講話的。」如自己去站崗，則非荒廢學業不可，如每次須費五十元，我是個貧困的失業者，對這筆費用，無法貼補。而且依照規則，自警團應自己去站，但是學生們是有功課的，他們是未來祖國的建設者，誰忍坐視他們荒荒廢學業呢？吾幫請求保甲當局，體念全市學生，能否收回學生站崗成命？如不可能，亦請通知各聯保處，應盡是調整學生站崗時間，使與上課　點不相衝突。（沈企賢）</p>
<h3>贈氣喘治療法</h3>
<p>氣喘又名痰喘，又名喘咳，乃就病狀得名，因為氣喘之發生，多半有咳嗽痰鳴之現象也。若不及時調治，病根與日俱深，發作愈頻，病勢日重，往往成為哮喘。內科陸奎生編著「氣喘特效速愈法」一書，詳述哮喘之根治　　欽食須知，氣喘特效速愈法等，伏天治療，最合時宜。可向威海衛路五六三弄四號（正陽路西）陸奎生診所面索，或附郵函索均可。</p>
<p>三和小學招免費生</p>
<p>上海基督教女青年會，本年度為搶救失學起見，在小沙渡路海防路口三和裏二三號，開辦三和小學，學費僅　　上一般學校之半，上課全日，級別自一年級至六年級，每級招考新生五十名，家境確屬清寒者，學費並可予以全免。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>血與淚（四）</p>
<p>「神　是任何一個軍　都有的。坐潛水艇是更需要拜神的，所以潛水艇裏當然是有的。」</p>
<p>新出少慰這樣說，但一平方寸空間的地方也不能隨便放鬆的屋內，竟放著一個高高地小白木神　。魄的瓶子和藍色的楊木，在塗著灰色管和辦的裏面　立著。</p>
<p>在　射魚　前，先在魚雷上塗上酒，同時還必須想到，常常陷於危險的潛水艇，也要靠神來保佑的。而想像到，在神　前駕馭那樣複雜錯綜的機械力之水手們，使命守祈禱的姿態時，　夫就在心裏說，真是一幅美而有力的畫。</p>
<p>在無人的士官室裏坐著，三個人的談話中心就不能不專集中在潛水艇上。</p>
<p>隱藏性，航程，單獨性——這就是潛水艇的特長，介同時這也是勞苦和危險的主要因素。假如沒有以潛水艇接近敵人的隱藏性，那末這樣複雜錯綜的機械和人打成一片的訓練，忍若耐勞，蜜自愧　艇內生活，也就不必要了。如沒有往復大洋的長途航程，則就不需要忍受艇內像落雨般的濕度，臭氧，淡而無味的罐頭食糧了。此外與其他艦艇共同出動時，也是要早炸雷的危險，讓其他友艦躲避的。潛水艇正因為　作潛水艇，所以一切的勞苦與危險，一定要擔負起來。</p>
<p>至於任務，則有哨戒，破　航路，　　陸地，敷設機雷等等，但其本身任務，則在於潛艇挺身以魚雷射擊敵方巨艦。如此說來，潛水艇之為物，　不是成為水底魚雷艇了麼？在威海術，旅順和日本海　表示過帝國海軍獨特戰法的水雷艇傳統，豈不是業已伸入水底了麼？</p>
<p>夫在內心裏這樣反反復複地想著。</p>
<p>「的確是這樣，水雷艇精神和潛水艇精神，從在根本上相同，但表現形式也許有所不同。總之，佐久間艇長的精神，是純粹潛水艇隊號的精神呵！」</p>
<p>真人這樣發表著隆夫所未聽過的　論。</p>
<p>不久，三個不走出艇外。太陽光線愈　酷烈地刺射了。</p>
<p>「那末，到了上校的地方去，聽聽各種講話吧！」</p>
<p>新田少慰開始向校宿走，但隆夫在途中又特別去看看海底調查用的可愛小潛水艇，以為心中的記念物。</p>
<p>「真人，像這樣小的潛水艇，戰著魚雷潛人敵港，一定很有趣。」</p>
<p>隆夫雖然是說的笑話，但真人和新田突然面對面地目瞪口呆，而一時說不出話來。（一二三）</p>

<h3>Courageous Advance</h3>
<p>Following the completion of his cabinet formation, Prime Minister Koiso Kuniaki of the Allied Nation delivered his first broadcast, demonstrating to the nation a resolute belief in courageously leaping forward to pioneer new horizons and achieving certain victory, which is of profound significance. A nation is a collective of its people, and the nation's achievements depend on the efforts of its people. If the people can all courageously leap forward and advance with vigor, how can the nation not prosper?</p>
<p>We have stated that the Greater East Asia War is a revolutionary war of liberation. Therefore, for the sake of maintaining their century-long exploitation of East Asia's interests, the Anglo-Americans will undoubtedly struggle with all their might. The Greater East Asia War is the result of a century of oppression, and the success of the Greater East Asia War is inevitable, like the inexorable spread of fire. No one can stop our victory in the Greater East Asia War. However, during the course of the war, and when the enemy is making a desperate last stand, we must use our utmost strength to control them. On the one hand, we must endure hardship and toil; on the other hand, we must exert all our strength to advance courageously and defeat the enemy in a single blow.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Tojo stated in his talk on the 18th, "Today is truly the best opportunity to annihilate our enemies and determine the final outcome. At this moment, to protect our Imperial nation, we have no choice but to advance. With no illusions in our hearts, and disregarding life and death, we must恪守战训,倾举全力,迅速灭敌 (恪守战训,倾举全力,迅速灭敌: adhere strictly to combat training, exert all our strength, and swiftly annihilate the enemy)". The statements of both former and current Prime Ministers demonstrate the Allied Nation's national policy, its thorough and unwavering commitment, and its consistency from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Courageous advance is not empty talk, but a manifestation of actual achievements. In this cabinet reshuffle, General Koiso Kuniaki, at the age of 65, was reinstated from reserve duty to active service, best representing the spirit of "挺身躍起 (挺身躍起: courageously leaping forward)," "老當益壯 (老當益壯: vigorous in old age)," and courageous advance. In this great era, all citizens should contribute to the nation. The resurgence of veteran and experienced leaders of the Allied Nation will further encourage the soldiers of the Greater East Asia War. This spiritual encouragement will further strengthen the "敵愾同仇 (敵愾同仇: common hatred of the enemy)" mentality of all the peoples of Greater East Asia. Everyone must realize that now is the best time, regardless of gender or age, to contribute to the nation, using the strength of the entire Greater East Asian peoples to exchange for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the entire Greater East Asian peoples, and exchanging temporary pain for permanent benefits. This is the responsibility of everyone at present.</p>
<p>The Allied Nation's cabinet has been reorganized and is ready. Over the past few years, the policies of the Allied Nation have truly been advancing moment by moment and striving step by step. The open acknowledgement of the Saipan Island incident without evasion strengthens the people's faith. The cabinet reshuffle without hesitation, resolutely implemented, further increases the people's courage. Everything indicates that the entire nation, from top to bottom, is determined to advance courageously on the road to the one and only final victory. No hardship can stop this determination, and no sacrifice can extinguish the strong progress. All the people are calmly awaiting the opportunity for the final blow, which is being prepared and carried out at every moment, concentrating and storing all the strength. This final blow can be fatal to Britain and the United States, and can turn the entire Greater East Asia around.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Koiso of Japan visited the Yasukuni Shrine at 7:30 a.m. on the 23rd, returned to the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:00 a.m., and handled handover matters with former Prime Minister Tojo. At noon, he presided over a meeting of cabinet ministers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The cabinet of Prime Minister Koiso of Japan held a cabinet meeting at noon on the 23rd at the Prime Minister's official residence.

<h3>Imperial Rule Assistance Association Decides to Cooperate with Newspapers; Mr. Kawashima Explains Intent to Support</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Kawashima, Director of the Information Department of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, stated on the 23rd, explaining the intention to support the new cabinet, that the birth of the new cabinet is a matter of great concern to the entire nation. The speed of its establishment and the strength of its structure have enlightened the nation's mood and can be said to have refreshed people's hearts. This refreshment of people's hearts lies in arousing the deep-seated loyalty in the people's hearts and planting a seed of national autonomy. It is not just government collaborators, but also the basis for warfare should be based on the people. Therefore, it is necessary for the people to absolutely trust the government and for the government to absolutely care for the people's politics. Furthermore, making the people understand the true situation of the times should not create timidity. It is hoped that the government will have a great and straightforward attitude of governing with the people. In the future, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association will cooperate with the new cabinet, but this cooperation will not be merely following blindly, like its partisans, but rather to support what should be supported, so that the people's national politics can advance grandly.</p>
<p>Rising Up of the Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps Members</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Rule Assistance Youth Corps of Japan held a general meeting at its headquarters on the 24th. Here is a summary of its resolutions: The National Prefectural Group Leaders and Headquarters Chiefs Meeting will be held on the 25th. Clarify the policy of promoting the Youth Corps and determine specific practical methods. A total of 1.4 million members nationwide will rise up together. The current key practical activities of the Youth Corps headquarters are to uplift morale, defend the nation, enhance military production, and increase grain production. The gist of the resolution is as follows: At the time of the establishment of the new cabinet, it issued a statement saying that in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the national affairs will depend on the general staff headquarters and advance courageously. In response to this, and in view of the importance of the mission, this group will strengthen the practical action policies from the past to protect the Imperial nation.</p>
<p>Talk by Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo</p>
<p>Xinjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo met with reporters and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: At this decisive moment, the Allied Nation has changed its cabinet and formed a stronger war cabinet, to which Manchukuo is immensely excited. What is particularly gratifying is that I have known the new Prime Minister Koiso since the founding of Manchukuo, and in the early days of Manchukuo's establishment, much of the important foundational work depended on the strength of General Koiso. General Koiso is shouldering this extraordinary situation, gathering the total strength of Japan and Greater East Asia, and I am confident that he will be able to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory. Furthermore, Navy Minister Yonai is known for his political experience and is a respected elder statesman of the Japanese Navy. The ministers under these two generals are also powerful figures. I now declare that Manchukuo will at any time be one with Japan, complete the Greater East Asia liberation war, and advance towards the path of defeating the Anglo-Americans and building a new world. The responsibility that Manchukuo must bear to complete the war is becoming increasingly important, so we will exert all our strength to consolidate the defense of local border areas and enhance combat power.</p>
<p>Ba Maw Explains Stance</p>
<p>Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Ba Maw, Head of State of Burma, issued a statement on the 23rd, saying that this time Japan has changed its leader in a difficult situation, hoping to strengthen the war situation, and in the future, the Japanese people's war will become even more resolute. Judging from the experience of General Koiso, he will not only inspire the war will of the Japanese people, but also inspire the people of Greater East Asia to gradually strive for progress. Moreover, many of the new cabinet members are his former acquaintances. Taking the case of Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia Shigemitsu as an example, we can know that Mr. Shigemitsu will continue to implement his future policies for Greater East Asia. This is a matter for rejoicing in the Greater East Asia. Here, in addition to doing our best to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, we also place great trust in the unchanging policies of the new cabinet.</p>
<p>Philippine President Sends Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>Manila, 24th (Central News Agency) - The President of the Philippines sent a special telegram to Prime Minister Koiso on the 24th, congratulating him, saying that at this critical moment, Your Excellency has received the great command to take over as Prime Minister. I would like to extend my greatest congratulations on behalf of the Philippines. We are confident that with Your Excellency's profound insight and high prestige, taking on the heavy responsibility of the cabinet will be able to exert the greatest strength in completing the sacred war, and the final victory of the Asian nations will be achieved soon.</p>
<p>Java's War Spirit Further Strengthened</p>
<p>Jakarta, 24th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Soekarno, Speaker of the Central Council of Java, issued a statement on the 21st, the gist of which is as follows: The 500,000 people of Java hope that the new Japanese cabinet will have more powerful activities, and at the same time, hope to complete the Greater East Asia War with new courage and firm determination. This time, Prime Minister Koiso and all the ministers who have taken office have visited Java many times and have a deep understanding of our Indonesians. Furthermore, Earl Terauchi, who served as the military and political advisor to Java, has made many contributions to the military and political affairs of Java. Therefore, the people of Java place great trust in the new Japanese cabinet, and in order to enhance combat power, they will further strengthen their determination to fight to the end, and take this opportunity to strengthen the 500,000 Indonesian people's system of striving for progress, and move towards the path of victory.</p>
<p>Thoughts of Vietnamese Authorities</p>
<p>Saigon, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese diplomatic authorities issued a statement on the 22nd, saying: Koiso and Yonai have received the great command to form a cabinet. From our observation, we believe that the Japanese Empire is truly seeking to unite the entire country with maximum effort. In particular, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai are typical figures of the Japanese Army and Navy, and other figures from political parties have also participated, with a neat lineup and a strong color of unified support. From the perspective of foreigners, the current Japanese system is a healthy period, and the future of the new cabinet is greatly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Implementation Plan for Increased Military Production to Be Actively Promoted</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Before the formation of the new cabinet, the heavy industry sector paid unusual attention to the selection of the Minister of Munitions. When the Koiso cabinet was established and Ginjiro Fujiwara took office as Minister of Munitions, they expressed great trust. During the Tojo cabinet, the Munitions Ministry was established to enhance military production, aiming to rapidly plan production. The ministry adjusted the scheduled production and formed a Scheduled Production Adjustment Council, formulated the Council on Implementation Guidelines for Adjustment, and, in order to establish a responsible production system, formulated the Munitions Company Law, designated munitions companies, established a civil administration department system, clarified the production department labor system, and conducted administrative inspections by cabinet advisors. It has made great contributions to the production efforts of the mining sector. In order to plan and establish a domestic self-sufficiency system, the Tojo cabinet studied emergency development policies for domestic minerals such as iron ore, improved the treatment of workers in coal mines and other mines, and implemented various incentive systems. Although the Munitions Ministry has only been established for a short time, various policies and measures have been prepared, and it is expected that the new Minister of Munitions will strongly implement them.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reconnaissance Plane Spying on Northern Chishima Shot Down</h3>
<p>Northern Pacific Base, 24th (Central News Agency) - At dawn on the 23rd, three enemy planes attempted to invade the Northern Chishima Islands. They were intercepted by the local Japanese military unit, and one B24 type plane was shot down. The other two planes retreated eastward without being able to enter.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Health Improving Daily After Treatment by Allied Nation Doctors; Governor Chen Chunpu of Guangdong Province Arrives in Japan to Pay Respects</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Chen Chunpu, Governor of Guangdong Province and concurrently Director of the Pacification Headquarters in Guangdong, departed from Yan’an on the 18th and flew to Fukuoka via Taipei on the 19th. This trip was on behalf of the military and civilians of Guangdong and his colleagues to offer respects and wish Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government a speedy recovery, and to visit the authorities of Eastern Japan. After arriving in Fukuoka, Chen took a train to Tokyo. In addition to paying respects to the Chairman, he also visited the Ise Grand Shrine to pray for the Chairman's early recovery and the early victory of the Greater East Asia War. He arrived safely in Tokyo at 9:00 a.m. on the 23rd and stayed at the Imperial Hotel. When interviewed by reporters, he was asked about the Chairman's condition. He replied that the Chairman had been receiving treatment in Japan, following the doctor's treatment program, and his spirit and physical strength were improving daily. The progress was very good, and he would definitely recover within the scheduled period. This was all due to the careful treatment of the doctors of the Allied Nation and the concern of the authorities, for which the entire nation was extremely grateful. After returning to China, he would tell the people of Guangdong, who would be even more encouraged. He also said that in the past few days, he had observed that the Japanese people's war spirit was high, their lives were serious, and their spirits were tense, with a strong belief in winning the Greater East Asia War. He was very impressed. Chen is scheduled to visit the Meiji Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine on the 25th, and then visit various authorities.</p>
<h3>Concentrate Strength to Increase Production, Break into Decisive Battle Posture; Discussions at Branches of Japanese Central Cooperation Council</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - At the branch discussion meetings of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council on the 23rd, members of the 3rd and 5th divisions, based on their past experience, frankly expressed their opinions on key issues such as current labor mobilization, production technology, military production increase, and opening up of bottlenecks. The government paid special attention to this and sent representatives to attend and explain in detail the government's views and future handling methods, which is highly anticipated. The situation of the two divisions is summarized below. Regarding the issue of mobilizing students, it was said that now is not the time to focus on facilities and mechanisms in factories. Everything should be abandoned to break into a decisive battle posture. The issue of students today should also be considered with equal emphasis on both learning and labor, that is, 学勤并重(学勤并重). In short, under today's situation, special attention should be paid to labor, and all strength should be concentrated on increasing production. However, most people have not been able to understand the current situation, so improvements and maintenance of factory mechanisms have still been problematic. However, the current period is extremely important, and students should not pursue the issue of factory facilities. Mr. Fujino, Director of the Vocational Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Education, expressed his opinion on this, saying that the mobilization of students should always be based on the national purpose and national needs. Efforts should be made to guide issues related to admission. From the next academic year, the Ministry of Education will supervise the examination plans of higher vocational schools to determine the current capabilities of students, set standards for future education, and make them the foundation of Japanese education. More attention will be paid to this point to make them standard Japanese citizens. Regarding the issue of conscription, it was decided to implement measures for conscripting industrial personnel. For military work, labor inspections will be carried out on both men and women after the age of 20, with the hope of forming an industrial reserve army. Furthermore, the conscription system is not limited to factories; it should also be implemented in mines. Therefore, various opinions were raised regarding the excessive reallocation of existing labor. It was also suggested that women's volunteer corps should be assigned specialized female instructors, and that the content of company management should be disclosed to laborers. Finally, it was suggested that a comprehensive association of Japanese industrial and technical experts should be organized to meet the needs of the war situation. Mr. Mizuno served as the chairman of the 5th division meeting. During the meeting, various opinions were raised on increasing military production, opening up bottlenecks, and mobile labor in factories, among other points. The councilors also expressed their opinions separately, emphasizing that the anti-aircraft measures in factories were not perfect. In today's situation where air raids are inevitable, the most important thing is the preparation of relocation sites and machinery supplements for factories. From the perspective of labor mobilization, the remnants of liberalism and the attitude of pursuing profits still exist in the corporate system, which is regrettable. It is hoped that Mr. Kitano, Head of the Documentation Section of the Ministry of Munitions, will thoroughly urge the implementation of the Munitions Company Law.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aggression Against China Exposes Ambition; Wallace's Remarks Worth Noting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - Wallace arrived in Seattle on July 9 via Canada, and had a meeting with U.S. President Roosevelt for about two hours. Wallace is Roosevelt's most trusted disciple, and his words fully reflect Roosevelt's thinking. However, he was not nominated during the U.S. Vice Presidential nomination on the 21st of this month, because Roosevelt believed that Wallace could succeed him, but now this idea has been shattered. The question is how Wallace will advise President Roosevelt after returning to the country, and how he will address the nation. Here is a special report: After visiting Chongqing, Wallace witnessed the living conditions and lifestyles of the local people and proposed that they should be the same as those in the United States. Wallace said that if the lifestyles of the two peoples can be the same, then the youth and trade of China should be developed as much as possible to change the new world of East Asia. Looking at Wallace's remarks, it can be imagined that the U.S. economic aggression against China has reached its final stage. Wallace also said, "It is necessary to develop and prosper the Pacific coast, because Seattle is a suitable place for economic development towards Asia, and it is planned to expand Washington greatly to develop culture towards Asia, especially the west coast of the United States, which is already highly developed, and now we should further develop Asia." If the above points can be implemented, then it can make trade with China and the Soviet Union in Asia more developed. In this way, the people of the western United States will become richer. The current economic development of the United States cannot be said to have reached its peak, and we should further actively contribute economically to Asia. Wallace also said, "Although my visit to China this time was very short, I felt this way after witnessing the underdeveloped state of agriculture and industry in China." Based on the above remarks, we can know Wallace's opinions and Roosevelt's ambition and dream of creating a "China Americanized". At the same time, we can understand the purpose of Wallace's main argument to Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Director Huang of Military Affairs Arrives in Tokyo for Inspection</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Huang, Director of the Military Affairs Department of the National Government Army, arrived in Tokyo by plane via Fukuoka on the afternoon of the 24th to conduct an inspection in Japan.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - After Mr. Matsuzaka took office as Minister of Justice, he immediately appointed Mr. Nakano, Chief Prosecutor of the Osaka High Court of Appeals, as the new Chief Prosecutor.</p>

<h3>Night Battle Unfolds on Miyakojima Island; Japanese Garrison Inflicts Heavy Damage on Enemy; Enemy Landing Attempt on Tinian Island Foiled</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency) - The enemy's counter-offensive against the Mariana Islands in the Central Pacific has intensified since the occupation of Saipan, with repeated bombings of Tinian, Rota, and Miyakojima. On the 21st, they finally invaded Miyakojima. At dawn on the 21st, dozens of enemy transport ships, under the cover of a mobile force off the coast of厚之(Atsushi), approached the west coast of Miyakojima. Dozens of boats were divided into two routes. One route, with 120 landing craft, landed in the Akash湾(Akashi Bay) area at 7:20 a.m., and the other route, with 20 boats, invaded 昭和湾(Showa Bay) at around 8:00 a.m. and began landing. The exact strength of the enemy has not been determined. According to what was determined that night, the American forces in the 明石湾(Akashi Bay) area consisted of one and a half divisions, with about 150 amphibious tanks. The enemy forces in the 昭和湾(Showa Bay) area were also more than half a division, with 50 tanks, totaling two divisions. The Japanese coastal defense forces intercepted the enemy near the coast. In the 昭和湾(Showa Bay) area alone, they destroyed 30 of the 50 attacking enemy tanks. In addition, many troop-laden boats were sunk or destroyed by the Japanese army, so the landing enemy was extremely shocked. However, enemy reinforcements arrived one after another and subjected the Japanese army to intense bombardment, so they were ultimately unable to prevent the enemy from landing. The Japanese army waited until sunset and then launched a magnificent night assault on the enemy landing sites, inflicting heavy damage. However, this battle was again hindered by the enemy's superior firepower, and in the end they were unable to force the enemy to retreat to the sea. The enemy then established weak bridgeheads in both areas. It is reported that the enemy mobile force appeared off the coast of the island on the evening of the 17th and subsequently subjected the island to unprecedentedly intense bombing, attempting to land during the gap. However, this was hindered by the Japanese army's excellent defensive battle, so the landing did not begin until the 21st. The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command declared on the occasion of this landing battle that the bombardment of the Japanese army positions on the island before the landing was the most intense since the beginning of the Pacific War, and the Japanese army's resistance battle was becoming increasingly stubborn. According to enemy rear reporters, the enemy fired more than 10,000 tons of shells and bombs before landing, which shows the fierceness of the battle between the Japanese and enemy armies on Miyakojima. The morale of the Japanese army garrison is high. They have continuously shelled during twilight, at night, and at dawn, and have used the terrain to launch continuous counterattacks based on the original fortifications, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 24th (Central News Agency) - Enemy forces and transport ship convoys appeared off the southwest of Tinian, Mariana Islands, on the morning of the 24th, with dozens of landing craft, attempting to land on the island. At that time, the Japanese army garrison on Tinian was strictly defended and immediately opened fire, resulting in one enemy battleship and two destroyers being hit and catching fire. The landing craft were also severely damaged, so the enemy's landing attempt was foiled.</p>
<h3>Hengyang Offensive and Defensive Battle Intensifies Daily; U.S. Planes Invade Qingyuan Airspace</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - The offensive and defensive battle of Hengyang is becoming increasingly fierce. According to Chongqing news on the 23rd, the Japanese army, approaching the southwest of Hengyang city, broke into the western capital of the city on the 22nd and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing army garrison.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced the war situation in Guangdong Province on the 22nd as follows: The war in Hengyang is still continuing, and the Japanese army is constantly attacking. The Japanese army in Liling, in an attempt to occupy the Gui Dong in the Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, has moved eastward. The Chongqing army is making every effort to prevent the Japanese army advancing southward from Laiyang in the south of the city, and fierce battles are also taking place in Fangxian and Chaling. There is still no new progress on the Guangdong front, but the war is still continuing.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base, 24th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing invaded Qingyuan airspace on the 21st and dropped bombs with parachutes, injuring many innocent farmers.</p>
<h3>Residents of Shaan County Return One After Another</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Shaan County, Henan, 24th: Shaan County, a strategic point on the Longhai Railway Line, has been under the control of the "Peace Zone" for two months, and the majority of the population has returned one after another. According to a resident who returned to Shaan County, when the Japanese army entered the city on May 18th, he said, "I am deeply grateful for the kindness of the Japanese army." The Chongqing side levied heavy taxes of 10,000 yuan per street and alley every year. Moreover, corrupt officials often violated the orders of the Chongqing side, prohibiting the manufacture of tobacco to obtain huge profits, and squeezing the people's wealth to enjoy a life of extravagance and debauchery. Therefore, all residents felt dissatisfied and suffered under the Chongqing side. Currently, slogans such as "Sino-Japanese Friendship, Down with Britain and America, Build a New China" are posted along the streets of the county. Furthermore, when the Shaan County Security Maintenance Association was established on June 1st, Zhang Xiangao, who bravely stood up for the construction of Shaan County, has seen the return of 20,000 residents to date, which is about one-tenth of the original population. In addition, the first phase of residents' return to their hometowns to work has been completed, and efforts are currently being made to organize various administrative agencies.</p>
<h3>Highways Opened in Zhengzhou, Xuchang and Other Places</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese army front-line base, 24th: As a result of the Henan campaign, a portion of the western section of the Longhai Railway Line from Zhengzhou to Baoji, and the southern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway Line (from the south bank of the Yellow River to Xinyang), which previously belonged to the Chongqing side, have been occupied by the Japanese army. The cities along these two major transportation routes have been freed from the heavy burden of the Chongqing regime for seven years and have regained their light. The construction of new Henan must first begin with the construction of highways, the arteries of transportation. Currently, the villagers in towns near Xuchang, south of Zhengzhou, have been holding shovels every day to work on road construction. Once the highway is completed, materials can be freely transported. At the same time, it will also make a great contribution to ensuring public security. The fall of Zhengzhou occurred on April 20th, Xuchang on May 1st, Yancheng on May 5th, and Luoyang on May 25th. Therefore, the recovery situation is best in Zhengzhou, where a telegraph and post office were established in July. Moreover, in various places, security maintenance associations, construction committees, and chambers of commerce were established one after another after the Japanese army entered the city, and they immediately began formal activities. Therefore, Henan is now on the path of construction.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau Pays Attention to Citizen Air Defense</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 24th: In order to ensure that citizens understand the meaning of air defense and fire prevention, and the necessity of equipment, the Zhejiang Provincial Police Bureau specially convened the chairmen of various trade associations in the city yesterday (the 20th) to hold a discussion meeting, hoping that shops and residences would equip themselves, especially black cloth covers for electric lights and fire extinguishing bombs. Inspections will be launched within the next week, and those who fail to meet the requirements will be given appropriate punishment.</p>
<h3>Adhere to the Belief in Victory, Fight Together to the End, Mussolini Cables Hitler</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: Huitong News Agency reports: After visiting Germany, Italian Republic Prime Minister Mussolini sent a telegram to German leader Hitler, forcefully stating his belief in the final victory of the Axis powers. It roughly stated: When I returned to Italy, I was excited to think that God blesses you to improve the future, and I sincerely congratulate you. I especially telegram you to reiterate that the soldiers of the Italian Republic currently being trained in Germany are all extremely determined to fight alongside the German soldiers for the final victory, to complete the great cause of National Socialist Germany and Fascist Italy in suppressing Bolshevism. This determination and aspiration will never change.</p>
<h3>Pope Condemns Communism</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Vatican, 24th: Since the anti-Axis forces occupied Rome, the Pope yesterday publicly expressed his views on Italian Communism for the first time. The Pope especially condemned the newly published Communist weekly "Voice of Labor" in Rome, saying: "What we are dissatisfied with is that there are a generation who consider themselves Catholics but believe in theories that have been officially condemned."</p>
<h3>War Approaching Italian Territory, Florence</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports: The British and American forces on the Italian front are now concentrating their activities south of Florence. Many divisions of the Eighth Army have deployed on the two roads from Poggibonsi to Florence and from Montevarchi to Florence. There is little doubt that the enemy will focus its future large-scale offensive in these areas. The enemy's smaller offensives are targeting German positions in the Cassino area. The German rearguard troops there have continued to retreat along the road to Pisa.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports, according to official German war reports: Yesterday, enemy forces in Italy launched a major offensive against the German rearguard troops north of Livorno. The rearguard troops retreated to the north bank of the Arno River during the fighting. The fighting was particularly fierce north of Poggibonsi.</p>
<h3>German Leader Recovers from Injuries</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: Regarding the attempted assassination of German leader Hitler, Berlin newspapers all published it on the 22nd and published a portrait of Leader Hitler, indicating the President's health. Moreover, on the side of the photo, there were portraits of Commander Sorlini, newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Domestic Army Himmler, Marshal Goering, and Senior General Leerch. In addition, the minor burns on Mr. Xi's face caused by this incident have healed.</p>
<h3>Swedish Defense Minister Warns the People</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Swedish capital, 24th: German News Agency reports: The Swedish Defense Minister delivered a speech warning the people that the danger of war is now increasingly approaching Sweden. If the anti-Axis forces attack the north, Sweden will inevitably be划into a dangerous area. The danger from the east also seems to be gradually approaching, but anyone who dares to infringe on Sweden's freedom will pay a heavy price, because Sweden's military strength has greatly increased in recent years.</p>
<h3>Turkey Under Pressure, Adopts a Policy of Delay</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Budapest, 24th: The three-week pressure exerted by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on Turkey has not yet reached a conclusion. The Turkish government's policy of delay has been successful. The Turkish Parliament suddenly announced that it would recess for two weeks starting from the 28th. Prime Minister产拉卓格鲁 and German Ambassador to Turkey Papen, as well as other Axis diplomatic corps, have also gone to Constantinople to avoid the heat. According to Ankara, the following ten points were raised regarding Turkey's attitude: The Turkish government skillfully uses the conflict of interest between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Temporarily observe the overall war situation, especially the Balkan situation, where the military has politically dominated. The lack of defense materials has been made clear to the military committees of the United States and Britain. German Ambassador Papen warned Turkey that any action providing enemy bases or allowing other military advantages would be an act of hostility, which has had a great effect. Judging from the above situation, the central issue for the current Turkish government is that the defense of the Dardanelles has become stricter. Although it has a supportive attitude towards the Axis camp, it still demands the supply of weapons from Britain and the United States. At the same time, it proposes to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to guarantee Turkey's status as a supplement to the decisions of the Tehran Conference, and adopts a first-class delaying tactic. In addition, a major issue is what countermeasures the Soviet government will take in the Balkans in terms of politics and military affairs. Currently, the pro-Soviet faction in Ankara's political circles has raised its head and tends to fundamentally overthrow British primacy. The diplomatic war between Britain and the Soviet Union surrounding Turkey has reached a boiling point. Now the atmosphere of Turkey's participation in the war is gradually becoming stronger. Because the Turkish government is gradually making concessions to the demands of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, therefore, the recent possibility of severing relations with the Axis powers is quite high.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Returns Home from the Front Line</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Swedish capital, 24th: London officials announced yesterday: British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by his Chief of Staff General Ismay and other staff members, visited Normandy and has now returned.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Nationals Between Germany and Britain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 24th: Huitong News Agency reports, British News Agency message: One thousand British nationals detained in Germany and France arrived here yesterday by train and will be exchanged with German nationals.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Myitkyina, Conflicting Enemy Propaganda</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the northern Burma front, 24th: At the beginning of last month, the enemy broadcast said that the city of Myitkyina had been occupied by the Chongqing British and American Allied Forces and that mopping-up operations were still underway. However, in the middle of the month, it was said that the Chongqing British and American Allied Forces were currently reducing the encirclement of Myitkyina under the cover of aircraft, exposing the contradictions in their propaganda about the occupation of Myitkyina. This month, it broadcasted that the Allied airfield suffered heavy losses due to the Japanese army's attack, acknowledging the bravery of the Japanese army. It is very obvious that the enemy army failed to seize Myitkyina. At the same time, the enemy further exposed its difficult fighting situation around the city, because the fact is that the enemy and our two armies fought fiercely around the city for days.</p>
<h3>Soviet Advance Troops Arrive on the Outskirts of Lviv, Another Unit Advances Towards the San River</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports: The Soviet army's advance assault troops, after suffering heavy losses, arrived on the outskirts of Lviv (also known as Lvov) yesterday. Soviet troops northwest of Lviv advanced towards the San River and reached Rublin, west of the upper reaches of the Bug River. Powerful German troops and Soviet troops fought fiercely everywhere, and part of the front line has fallen into chaos. The German garrison in the central region fought fiercely with the Soviet army and blocked the Soviet army's offensive on the Brest-Litovsk to Grodno front line, sealing off the Soviet army's partial salient. German troops northwest of Grodno launched a fierce counterattack, driving the Soviet army east. German troops north of Kaunas also blocked the Soviet army's offensive.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German troops withdrew from Pskov and Ostrov in the northern sector of the Eastern Front on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Stalemate on the Finnish Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Helsinki, 24th: German News Agency reports: "Uusi Suomi" wrote today that the stalemate in the fighting around Finland is a characteristic of defensive victory. Germany's economic and military assistance to us is sufficient to increase our chances of resisting successfully. This assistance strengthens ourself confidence because our army has obtained new tools for combat and a new motivation to fight for freedom. The newspaper continued, there is no doubt that the Soviet army will launch a new offensive, but the possibility of favorable defense and the resolute fighting spirit of the Finnish army guarantee that the enemy will encounter stronger resistance.</p>
<h3>Germany Transfers Reserve Troops to Reinforce, Major Battle in Northern France About to Break Out, German Troops Withdraw from Saint-Lô to Adjust Lines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: German News Agency reports, military information: The German army has made full use of the recent lull in the European war zone and has transported reserve troops to the front line in order to strengthen its resistance against the British army under General Dempsey, who is apparently about to launch a large-scale offensive east of the Orne River. It is reported that the British army has assembled ten divisions there, including tank divisions.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 24th: General Dempsey has received reinforcements and replenished his arms. Once the weather improves, the British army will launch another offensive in the eastern part of the European front line. The British army's replenished strength is now not much different from the strength when it launched the offensive east of the Orne River last Tuesday. The local battles that have occurred in the past 24 hours seem to be forming a center of gravity for the battle. The British army is attempting to advance towards Martot, especially to seize the 72nd highland, Saint-Lô, and the two villages of Saint-Martin. It is reported that the British army on the eastern flank has heavily shelled the German front line on both the east and west wings of Troarn. Judging from its actions, it seems that the area southwest of Troarn and Caen will be the target of its next offensive. The German army in the eastern part of the European front line has been relatively quiet in recent days, taking the opportunity to gather reinforcements and stabilize the positions it holds, so it has abandoned the village of Saint-Lô and switched to defending new positions south of Martot. The American army is shelling fiercely in the area between Saint-Lô and Bérigny, and it seems that it will launch a new offensive. General Bradley has apparently transferred new troops to prepare for an offensive. The German army has now taken countermeasures there. The American army has not made any progress near La Haye-du-Puits.</p>

<h3>Symposium on Science and Technology</h3>
<p>Reporter: Today's symposium is intended to allow everyone, based on their expertise, to offer guidance on the militarization of science and technology, meaning the various ways science and technology can become production technology. When it comes to the productionization of science and technology, the most important thing is the scientific mobilization that the government is enthusiastically considering. So, let's first invite Section Chief Hanada of the Technology Agency to give us an overview of the current situation.</p>
<p>From the Science and Technology Council to the Research Mobilization Conference</p>
<p>Hanada: The establishment of the Technology Agency has also led to the emergence of the term "science and technology." The founding of the Technology Agency and the widespread application of the term "science and technology" occurred around the same time. As this kind of emphasis and atmosphere grew stronger, the Science and Technology Council was established in January of last year. This is a consultative body that offers opinions to the government on important issues related to science and technology. The Research Mobilization Conference was established in November of last year. Its important research tasks are aimed at strengthening military capabilities and implementing national mobilization. The establishment of this kind of organization is coordinated with changes in various government organizations. Of course, everyone is working hard with a desire to serve the country, but because they are only maintaining contact, there is no progress. The current Research Mobilization Conference is integrating all these scattered organizations across the country into a centralized and unified form. If it is used flexibly, we all believe that miracles will happen. However, the term "research" may give others a feeling of detachment from the world, thus misunderstanding the meaning of research and assuming that when the war has reached such a critical point, there is time to conduct research slowly. Misunderstandings are commonplace. Originally, the entire nation understood that research is something close to home. Therefore, it is said that daily life is research, just as Confucianism says, "The Way does not need to be sought afar." If everything can get on track in this way, Japan's research capabilities will be maximized. Therefore, this kind of research is increasingly needed as the war situation becomes more severe, and the content of the research will inevitably evolve with the times. Work that started ten years ago but is now ignored is gradually decreasing. However, the fundamental spirit has not changed. Only the forms of expression have changed a lot. Just now, I said that a centralized system has been established? However, this does not refer to everything. Since the system of the Research Mobilization Conference has now been established, then the whole country will be controlled. This statement is not entirely true. Depending on the content of the research and the scope of the research, the organization is naturally divided into many stages. If the adaptation of this form and the various organizations for various research can be carried out smoothly, then the national institution will be satisfactory. That's what I think.</p>
<p>Unification of Research Mobilization</p>
<p>Ryusha: Within the Ministry of Education, the Academic Research Council and the Special Committee for Scientific Mobilization have been established. However, they are independent of the Research Mobilization Conference, creating a duality. It seems necessary to unify them. Which aspect are you referring to?</p>
<p>Hanada: This means that when the nation proposes a research question, it naturally needs to accept this question. If there is nothing within society, no matter how you ask, you will not get anything. When the nation orders a certain research to be conducted, there will naturally be people and organizations that conduct that research. Among them, the main form handled by the Research Mobilization Conference is naturally related in this respect.</p>
<p>Inamura: This is a mistake in the reporting. The purpose of the Academic Research Council and the Special Committee for Scientific Mobilization of the Ministry of Education is completely different from the purpose of the Research Mobilization Conference. To say that this is a confrontational sectarian organization, or to say that this is a conflict between science and art, is completely wrong. In fact, there is no point of conflict. If a researcher receives an appointment as a wartime researcher from the Research Mobilization Conference and is also a member of a research team of the Academic Research Council, he must first accept the appointment as a wartime researcher and resign from the Academic Research Council. The Research Mobilization Conference is an extraordinarily excellent research mobilization system. According to the necessary tasks, it finds the most suitable person to be the wartime research director, and then has several wartime researchers attached to form a research team, and implements the principle of "better to have none than to have bad ones." Only mobilize those who can truly take on the task, and try to mobilize materials and personnel as much as possible. Of course, everyone wants to serve the country, but there may be waste in the use of materials and labor. Therefore, mobilizing all scientists and technicians may look good in form, but in practice, there are many inconveniences, so it is not done that way. For a realistic research topic, only those who have the ability to solve it can be adopted. I believe that this form of research mobilization is even better than the scientific mobilization of Germany, France, and the United States. The Research Mobilization Conference is focused and partial; the Academic Research Council is universal. The former aims directly at wartime research, while the latter aims at enhancing research capabilities.</p>
<p>Research Mobilization System and General Mobilization of Science and Technology</p>
<p>Inamura: Although the research mobilization system is completely in place, there is still no sign of general mobilization of science and technology, which I think is regrettable. In short, integrating all the power of Japanese scientists and technicians into a unified form to create a war-fighting capability, I think there is still a problem, which is the issue of further reorganization of academic associations. In addition, since the Academic Research Council of the Ministry of Education is an organization affiliated with the Ministry of Education, it should further organize research institutions of various ministries and private research institutes that do not belong to the Research Mobilization Conference, so as to move towards production and increase production. At the same time, scientific and technological issues must also be organized and rationalized. Nowadays, people generally talk about high-speed production, that is, if you want to complete high-performance machinery and materials in a very short period of time, you need speed. If you want to achieve this kind of situation, you must expand the scale of previous research institutions by more than ten times. I believe that the current task is to adopt this method.</p>
<p>Hanada: I believe that we are about to move in this direction sequentially. For example, when it comes to testing metal fatigue, there is fatigue testing work. The so-called fatigue testing has a very large number of fatigue testing machines, and fatigue testing naturally requires a considerable amount of time. Therefore, if ten places research ten fatigue testing problems, assuming that it takes a year, then ten answers can be obtained all at once after a year. However, if one person does it, it will take ten years. If they are combined together, one can be done each month, and twelve will be completed after a year. Therefore, the answer to the first question can be obtained in one month. In this way, although the same answer is obtained after a year, looking at the intermediate stages, many problems are often solved by this. This is certainly an extreme example, but this kind of thing cannot be done without a centralized approach nationwide.</p>
<p>Inamura: Let's take another concrete example. On the research side, there is the Small Committee of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, as well as the Research Neighborhood Group of the National Federation of Technological Alliances, or the specialized committees of various academic associations. They now have a fairly powerful system, which is very different from before, and adopt a collective approach. The current tendency is not to be preoccupied with issues such as one's own creative rights and priority. It seems that the organs that adjust these committees or neighborhood groups, whether in the Ministry of Education or in the Technology Agency, have not yet been established. I don't know if this is right? In short, I believe that the mobilization of academic societies and associations has not yet been implemented. Even if the mobilization of individuals or private researchers is carried out, no matter how it is carried out, the mobilization of groups such as academic societies and associations has not yet begun, which cannot but be said to be a regret.</p>
<p>Hanada: I believe that the Research Mobilization Conference was created and grew in this way. Although it is an ideal system, it cannot become an ideal system today. If you ignore the past facts, problems will naturally occur. If no problems occur and it develops naturally, this may be the best method. However, the speed cannot be maximized. This is based on the facts. If the speed is too fast, and the new ones in the back have not yet emerged, while the old ones have already been completely destroyed, then problems will occur.</p>
<p>Inamura: The Ministry of Munitions has already been established. Previously, the mission of the Control Association has been completely taken over. Therefore, the Control Association must have another new character. In the field of scientific and technological research, I believe that there is also a need for a powerful organization that executes the mission of this Control Association, such as a mobilization organization established in accordance with the General Mobilization Law. Now, the Scientific Mobilization Association has completely no relationship with scientific mobilization, and the National Federation of Science and Technology Associations has not inherited this power. To some extent, it can undertake the entrustment of government authority and work. Therefore, it can be said that this is the Control Association in the industrial field. In this organization, five or six full-time scientists and technicians should be added. I believe that this kind of institution is needed now.</p>
<p>Hanada: We should support the vital parts of all our current institutions as much as possible. Although this is ideal, depending on the situation, new organizations may have to be created. However, the so-called creation of new organizations necessarily requires the passage of many unreasonable things. Therefore, we should avoid acting unreasonably as much as possible. However, unreasonable phenomena may not be able to be avoided.</p>
<p>Inamura: In short, based on what we currently have, we should cultivate its strength as much as possible and work together consistently in our respective positions.</p>
<p>Hanada: It is a positive plan to work together consistently in our respective positions.</p>
<p>The Process of Industrializing Research Results</p>
<p>Reporter: I don't know the order of this before and after. What problems are there in the process of industrializing and producing the research results in the laboratory? On this point, please ask Mr. Bito to give us some guidance.</p>
<p>Bito: Is it the results of the research?</p>
<p>Reporter: It is the process of the results reaching practical industrialization or industrialization. What kind of process does it go through to reach this point?</p>
<p>Bito: According to the past method, it is necessary to estimate whether it is worthwhile before proceeding. However, in the things that we are handling within the Control Association now, if it is an invention that is good for work, or a research result is published, it is immediately moved to the factory for production. Therefore, one of the many issues that are written about prominently in newspapers every day recently, the so-called wartime-type machine problem, if it is researched well, it must be put into practice immediately. This presents a necessary issue that needs to be resolved, that is, giving a topic, ordering it to be researched by a certain date and time, and after it is concretized, immediately ordering it to be used in production. When the experiment is completed, it is moved to production. Our work is very urgent, so we must consider the time factor. You can't do anything without time. No matter what the research is, no matter what the work is, it is related to time. However, this is a method done within a very limited time. For example, this time for the increased production of aircraft, the purpose, that is, the desired topic, must be completed by a certain time. For example, when to achieve it by what date and time, and handing it over to the production organization, it is already stipulated when the design must be completed and when the experiment must be completed during the preparation period. Therefore, they work actively day and night within a certain period.</p>
<p>Reporter: So, making science and technology into a business is the content of the research topic! (To be continued) (Translated from the April issue of Japanese Review)</p>

<h3>First Police Bureau Promotes Crime Prevention Work Invites the Press to Explain the Meaning of Crime Prevention</h3>
<p>The Judicial Division of the First Police Bureau of this city has recently established a Crime Prevention Section in order to prevent crime, clarify social evils, ensure public security, and cooperate in the construction of Greater Shanghai, in order to achieve this profound ideal. Mr. Li Shiyu, the director of the division, realizing that crime prevention work is still in its initial stages in our country and that the general public does not have a deep understanding of it, urgently needs to use the power of propaganda to make all levels of society thoroughly understand the meaning of crime prevention and cooperate in unity. At the same time, he also hopes that members of the press will cooperate in promoting the work. Therefore, at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, he hosted a tea party at the Capital Hotel on the second floor to invite members of the press in this city. More than 40 representatives from the press in this city, including Chen Binhe, Cheng Zhongquan, and Lu Feng, attended. Director Li Shiyu, Deputy Director Guan Xian, and Section Chief Shi of the Crime Prevention Section personally hosted the event. During the meeting, Director Li Shiyu and Deputy Director Guan Xian delivered speeches successively, explaining the meaning of crime prevention. Then, Chen Binhe and Lu Feng delivered speeches on behalf of the press. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Director Li's Speech</p>
<p>Director Li said: "It is hot today. I am honored to have all of you gentlemen come to give us your guidance. I have been working in the police judiciary since the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and have developed close relationships with all levels of society. I had intended to consult with you all earlier, but due to various reasons, it has been delayed until now that I am holding a simple tea party to invite everyone. I am deeply apologetic. This time, the police authorities are launching crime prevention work. There is a need to report to our colleagues in the press and a need to request your cooperation. However, before discussing how to cooperate, let me give a brief report on crime prevention work. I have already broadcasted about the meaning and prospects of crime prevention a few days ago, so I will not repeat it. However, the origin of the crime prevention issue is due to my previous service in the judiciary. Last year, after taking over the police judiciary, I conducted research on crime and punishment. The purpose of punishment is also to prevent crime, but it has evolved from the past retaliatory or suppressive doctrine to a doctrine of moral reform, which is equivalent to a patient taking medicine for treatment. But wouldn't it be even better if we could prevent it before the illness occurs? Therefore, we are determined to use new methods to achieve the purpose of crime prevention and reduce crime. At the same time, crime and social ills, and the increase in crime, have a negative impact on society. To put society on the right track, we must first abide by various laws and make it develop normally. Since taking up the position of judicial police after the recovery of the concessions, I have discovered various abnormal phenomena. The so-called punishment is only applied to ordinary people, while those who have committed truly heinous crimes remain at large. Social morality has declined, and there is no law or order. Even the common morality in the air has gone bankrupt. However, law enforcement officials themselves cannot be completely sound. The past practices of detectives in the patrol room, accepting bribes and surrounding the territory, and the people's lack of legal knowledge, have led to bribery and corruption. Even those with a little integrity are induced. Therefore, there is a real need for a controlling force to implement crime prevention work with the power of all levels of society. As for the purpose of crime prevention work, broadly speaking, it is to put national politics on the right track and implement the rule of law. From the standpoint of the judicial police, it is to unite people from all levels of society to organize and reasonably reduce and even eliminate crime. Regarding crime prevention methods, in addition to investigation, organization, and training, the most important thing is propaganda. The press is the mouthpiece of the people and the nation. It can exert the power of public opinion to prevent crime. I hope that colleagues in the press will stand on the side of justice, so that the general public knows the law and abides by the law, and instructs society to punish crime, so that people who want to do evil cannot do so, and at the same time, morally reform them. Unite colleagues to serve as a member of crime prevention, and cooperate in guiding crime prevention work. I am determined to follow the spirit indicated by Mayor Chen, 'Good things, we are determined to do. Bad things, we are determined not to do,' and work together with everyone."</p>
<p>Deputy Director's Speech</p>
<p>Judicial Division Deputy Director Guan Xianerlang said in his speech: "Shanghai is a Chinese city in the East and enjoys a high reputation in the world. In terms of crime, it is difficult to avoid in cities around the world. Therefore, in the world's format, more emphasis is placed on politics and economy. In terms of construction and equipment, Shanghai is second to none in the East. With these superior conditions, crime is difficult to avoid. I firmly believe that the reason is that the people do not cooperate with the police, and in the past, due to the existence of concessions, the people were unwilling to endure oppression, which caused criminal behavior. In the past, the British adopted a high-pressure policy. On August 1st of last year, after the National Government took over the concessions, the interim legal rights were given to every Chinese person, protecting them and punishing them. Therefore, there is a need for thorough reform to adopt a new legal policy. Regarding the nature of crime prevention work, it is like a citizen who is not yet sick, preventing them from getting sick. The phenomenon in the past was to prescribe medicine for citizens who were already sick. The effect of this prevention work, in terms of examples, is to prevent the occurrence of cholera in the summer. In terms of punishment, pre-vaccination is administered. Therefore, when Shanghai's epidemic prevention work began, a few Chinese people did not understand Japan's sincerity, causing unfounded rumors. This reaction may be unavoidable at the beginning of crime prevention work. Only when crime prevention work reaches its peak will the general public definitely be grateful to the authorities. In the former case, we have to rely on the advocacy and criticism of public opinion to make all parties deeply understand. I deeply hope that the reporting gentlemen present will give their full assistance and care. This is what this office deeply hopes for." Then, Chen Binhe, the president of this newspaper, delivered a speech, which can be seen in the comments column of this newspaper today. Finally, Director Li and Deputy Director expressed their adoption of opinions respectively, making them accurately correct. We hope that the press will use the cooperation of public opinion to thoroughly eliminate special forms [of crime]. In addition, Lu Feng, Yao Jichuan and others expressed their opinions on crime prevention and discussed them in detail. They dispersed at around 6 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Change of Cabinet in Japan National Will Unchanged Minister Matsudaira Refutes Slanders by Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference at the Fairmont Peace Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, yesterday (the 24th) at 2:30 p.m. On the embassy side, Minister of Information Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukama attended, as well as reporters from various Chinese newspapers in this city. Minister of Information Matsudaira gave a speech on the recent formation of the new Japanese cabinet, as follows:</p>
<p>Fundamentally Unable to Understand</p>
<p>Minister of Information Matsudaira said that the recent establishment of the new cabinet in Japan has once again become a material for Britain and the United States to make reckless speculations and engage in trivial slanders. In the past, the general public in Britain and the United States had a superficial understanding of Japan. Their views of Japan often contained fallacies. The reason for this is that British and American politicians, whether in school education or social education, have never been willing to allow their own people to ask about the relationship between China and Japan and other countries in East Asia, as well as the feelings and hopes of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. Therefore, the general public has no fundamental understanding of East Asia. Fifty-four years ago, Japan promulgated a constitution adopting a system of representative government. Ten years ago, it revised the system of representative government to become a new form of system. This is the best system in Japan. The political source of Japan since ancient times has been further clarified and launched after the Meiji Restoration. The entire nation is united and consolidated with the emperor as the center. Therefore, the existence and change of the cabinet will never change the national will. Therefore, it is difficult for British and Americans to understand Japan.</p>
<p>Striking at the Ambitions of Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Minister Matsudaira continued: "After the establishment of the new cabinet this time, Prime Minister Koiso and the ministers expressed their opinions quite clearly. The military, officials, and civilians are united with the imperial family as the center. Therefore, the entire Japanese nation, both in the government and the public, will go all out to prevent Britain and the United States from returning to East Asia, strive to liberate Greater East Asia, and establish a new order based on national balance. The most meaningful thing is that Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also serves as Minister of Greater East Asia. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's concept of liberating Greater East Asia is not only the path of human evolution and development required by various countries in East Asia, but also seeks to make the world's people truly understand this original plan, which is of profound significance. Some members of the intellectual class in Britain and the United States understand this principle, such as Willkie and Lindbergh. There are also some leaders who lack complete understanding. The reason for this is that they cannot bear to interfere in the development of East Asia. However, based on their own selfish positions, they are unwilling to see the development of the East Asian nations. Therefore, we can only severely strike at this attitude of Britain and the United States to the end, making them suffer great pain. This is a prerequisite for the future of Greater East Asia's liberation."</p>

<p>Alarm Cancellation: Siren sounds two long tones continuously, each tone lasting fifteen seconds</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Orders Each Guild to Contribute Iron</h3>
<p>The Municipal Economic Bureau has been encouraging various trade guilds to donate scrap iron. Previously, Xu Dashen, the director of the bureau, first donated scrap iron from his private residence as an example. As a result, various guilds have enthusiastically contributed, achieving excellent results. As a small number of guilds have not yet reported, the bureau has ordered each of these guilds to report the total amount of scrap iron donated by their members within three days so that personnel can be sent to inspect and collect it.</p>
<h3>Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association Ordered to Dissolve</h3>
<p>Since the government authorities implemented the wartime materials control policy, they have been actively reorganizing the major commodity trade associations. The associations with unsound organizations will be absolutely improved or dissolved and suspended in order to cooperate in the task of materials control and achieve practical results. It is now known that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, after reporting on the Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association of this city, has found that the association's business conflicts with other noodle product industries, and the organization is unsound and the content is corrupt. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specifically instructed the Municipal Grain Bureau with Commercial Character No. 2451 to dissolve the Noodle and Cooked Food Industry Association immediately and merge the main business into the relevant departments of each related division to handle it. According to reports, the responsible persons of the association, Wang Bing Ziquan, etc., have committed the crime of collecting excessive amounts of money and embezzlement by taking advantage of their positions, and are still being detained in the District Prosecutor's Office.</p>

<h3>Crime Prevention Work</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin</p>
<p>——Speech at the tea party of the Judicial Division</p>
<p>Shanghai is a breeding ground for crime. The biggest reason is that ordinary people—also known as big pavilions—have a special mentality. On the one hand, they commit crimes, but on the other hand, they are proud of not being punished by the law, leading to the law losing its power of punishment. Even the law cannot protect the people, but is used to deceive and oppress them. In this social situation, it naturally gradually becomes a breeding ground for crime.</p>
<p>In the past, the actions of the judicial department of the patrol room were the darkest, and the people were most afraid of them. Since the recovery of the concessions, through the efforts of the police and judicial authorities, they have gradually reformed and moved onto the right track. This is very gratifying. However, the police and judicial departments of various sub-bureaus still cannot fully satisfy people. The bad habits of the past patrol room have not been thoroughly changed. It is hoped that the authorities will continue to work hard.</p>
<p>As for crime prevention work, it is more meaningful because it is more proactive. From then on, society can be stabilized and crime incidents reduced. Our goal of running a newspaper is actually partly the same. Therefore, we are extremely willing to cooperate in promoting it so that citizens can understand. The actual situation of the reorganization and reform of the judicial departments of various bureaus, and how it is different from the past patrol room, should be published as much as possible in newspapers so that people can understand.</p>
<p>Now that the police bureau has organized a crime prevention section within the scope of the judiciary, we believe that the main thing is that for the ordinary people and big pavilions, those who engage in hoarding, speculation, and windfall profits, the law should be enforced with great courage. Otherwise, all reforms and crime prevention will be ineffective.</p>

<h3>Civil Air Defense Singing Contest Held Enthusiastically Last Night, with Over 50,000 Participants</h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of this city, in order to promote the will of civil air defense and instill air defense knowledge in the public, specially held a "Civil Air Defense Singing Contest" at the central square of the Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse at 8:30 last night. The event was open to the public free of charge. Sun Lifu, the chief secretary of the headquarters, and officials from relevant authorities attended, as well as over 50,000 members of the public. The atmosphere was unprecedentedly warm. The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra first played the overture and the difficult dance music, followed by a speech by Chief Secretary Sun, who said: "The Air Defense Headquarters is holding this civil air defense singing contest, and I would like to express my deep gratitude for the presence of all sectors of society. Today, Shanghai is no longer a land of peace. Although Shanghai is far from the battlefield, it is not too far away. The enemy's surprise attacks are inevitable. Air defense work cannot be shouldered solely by the cadres of the Air Defense Headquarters. It must rely on the joint efforts of all citizens of Shanghai to make all-round air defense preparations to protect Shanghai," and so on. After the speech, news films and cultural films, as well as the first series of civil air defense films for citizens, were shown. Subsequently, Liang Leyin directed Li Leming to sing the Great Shanghai Air Defense Song, followed by film stars singing. Gu Ying sang "Annoying Morning," Wu Yong sang "Unchanging Heart," Liang Ping sang "Quit Smoking Song," and Zhang Hui, Zhang Yu, Huang Zhiguang, and Ouyang Feiying and Wu Yong and Liang Ping sang the "Great Shanghai Air Defense Song." The atmosphere throughout the event was very tense, and it did not end until about 10 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Cotton Allocation Prices Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval</h3>
<p>After the reorganization and establishment of the Cotton Industry Control Committee of the Business Integration Council, the entire plan for cotton industry control (such as cotton purchase and allocation, centralized production of cotton products, and operational affairs such as the receipt and allocation of cotton products) has been studied and a draft has been prepared, which will be submitted to the Ministry and the Executive Yuan for review and approval to determine its implementation. It is learned that the committee began purchasing cotton last winter in eleven regions, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Haimen, Nantong, Qidong, Dongtai, Heyu Town, Anqing, Hangzhou, and Ningbo. To date, there has been considerable success in meeting civilian needs. All cotton allocation prices have been determined and are being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Regarding the purchase price of new cotton this year, the committee will convene relevant parties in the middle of next month to discuss a reasonable purchase price that is suitable for the actual living conditions of farmers.</p>
<h3>Review of Grain Problems in Various Regions, Truth about Hoarding of Grain</h3>
<p>Hoarding of rice and grain is not only happening in Shanghai, it has become widespread in various regions. In Shanghai, hoarding grain is not considered an illegal act; the Municipal Government's temporary rice policy has legally recognized it. That is, after the immigration population was established, in addition to the rice purchased by the Rice Control Committee, the Municipal Government purchased rice to allocate to the general public, but citizens were allowed to store three months' worth of rice. Regardless of whether it is recognized by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee, it is probably unavoidable for rice merchants and the general public to hoard and store rice under the current circumstances of fluctuating rice prices. But what is the meaning of this mass hoarding? Those with financial resources hoard twelve shares of rice at rice prices that will not rise beyond this point, while those without financial resources cannot but continue to buy rice that is rising day by day. This situation means that the class that suffers the most from the high price of rice cannot but continue to buy high-priced rice; on the contrary, the class that does not suffer from the high price of rice can buy large quantities of cheaper rice. Those without financial resources are forced to hoard due to the necessity of living a life in which they cannot not hoard, and they hoard using the following method:</p>
<p>That is, they collect all their funds, buy rice, and resell most of it to others, using part of it for their own use for a certain period of time. They use the profits from the resale to buy rice that is cheaper as a result of this turnover.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to understand the situation in operation only needs to go to the Shanghai military station to see the rice merchants buying rice. Under these circumstances, even if the amount of rice imported into Shanghai increases, it will be difficult for rice prices to fall. In other regions, restrictions on the amount of rice that each citizen can purchase, and the strengthening of flour rationing, have all begun to be implemented. But this is only the difference between buying a large amount of rice at one time and buying a small amount of rice in several installments. Preventing the deepening of mass hoarding, in which people exchange money for rice as soon as they have it, is the most necessary and extremely difficult problem. As a result, rice prices are rising madly day by day.</p>
<p>Future Countermeasures against Hoarding</p>
<p>Needless to say, future countermeasures against hoarding should immediately investigate and punish unscrupulous merchants. However, for those who hoard more rice than is necessary, a policy of equitable distribution of rice cannot but be implemented. Good farmers are not allowed to not sell rice because they cultivate it themselves, and the hoarding masses are also completely unable to have the qualification to purchase rice without restriction because it is their own money. The economic authorities should immediately investigate rice hoarding. The really meaningful hoarding merchants should be universally investigated throughout the city in the shortest possible time. When rice-producing areas are inspecting and registering rice, there is no reason why Shanghai, the base of speculative hoarding, should not implement the above countermeasures. In addition, a special branch of the court should be set up in Shanghai, and rice speculators should be sentenced to death without exception. When investigating rice speculators, do not release most of them without charge, as was the case when investigating gold bars. Instead, investigate their crimes as soon as possible, regard them as pests of the people's livelihood, and demand that they be executed by firing squad.

<h3>The First and Second Police Bureaus Will Meet Again to Discuss Merger, Final Decision on Merger Procedures</h3>
<p>The first and second police bureaus of this city have decided to implement a merger starting on the first day of next month in order to complete the unification of Shanghai's police administration and establish a strong public security in Greater Shanghai. Key personnel of the police bureaus will hold another meeting within days to make a final decision on the merger procedures. According to a Central News Agency reporter, personnel above the section chief level of the Second Police Bureau will be merged into the First Bureau to work, while the eight members below the middle level will be transferred to various police sub-bureaus to serve. It is reported that the organization of the suburban sub-bureau will also be expanded, and new sections will be added.

<h3>The First Police Bureau Selects Outstanding Police Officers</h3>
<p>The Judicial Office of the First Police Bureau of this city, in order to select outstanding police officers, has organized an examination committee consisting of Director Li Shiyu, Deputy Director Guan Kenjiro, and Liu Shaokui, Deng Zhaojin, Yamayuan Tateo, Wen Fangnan, Yang Yongshi, etc., as members. Examinations for detectives will be held at Aurora University on today and tomorrow. The examination items include criminal law, criminal procedure, police common sense, judicial documents, and other technical subjects. In addition to the technical examination, the method of promotion also requires examination of character and usual service performance.

<h3>Strictly Prohibit Overcharging for Tricycle Licenses</h3>

The industry association sent personnel to check the car owners a few days ago, and they all stated frankly that there was no overcharging. The bureau is making every effort to actively promote the work to facilitate the citizens, and will send personnel to check at any time in the future. It is hoped that the car owners will cooperate and assist, and tell the truth. If there is evidence of overcharging after investigation, the overcharging personnel will be dismissed and investigated.</p>

<h3>Save the Shattered Countryside</h3>
<p>— Yu Shun</p>
<p>Given the increasingly serious problem of rice supply, allow me to report on the situation in a certain rice-producing area:</p>
<p>The call for increased production has indeed spread throughout intellectual circles, but the increased production movement has not yet been effective in agriculture. Farmers still use the old methods passed down from previous generations to grow crops. Due to factors that reduce production, such as fertilizer shortages, rampant pests, and local inefficiencies, it is difficult not only to maintain the original yield, but also a gradual decline is likely.</p>
<p>Currently, it takes a capital of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan to raise a pig. Ordinary farmers have long been unable to afford enough grain for themselves, so they don't have such a large capital to raise pigs. As a result, the most needed fertilizer for farmland—"pig manure"—is unavailable. As for bean cakes, the price is so shockingly expensive that of course they can't afford it. Therefore, they have to use water weeds and dredged river mud to serve as fertilizer. However, many people don't have boats. Even if someone has a boat, because the number of farmers collecting water weeds and dredging river mud has increased dramatically, grass is not easy to obtain, and mud is not easy to dredge. Due to the lack of fertilizer, the crops lack nutrition. Furthermore, there is a severe shortage of draught cattle in the countryside. Often, several families share one, resulting in delays in ploughing. When watering the fields, it is not always done in a timely manner, delaying the planting date. The crops are inherently deficient, creating early problems. In addition, the rice stem borer plagued us last autumn. Since there was no severe cold last winter, the stem borer is even more rampant this summer. The phenomenon of "hollow heart death" is very serious now, but the authorities have not been seen to advocate pest control, and the farmers only regard it as "heaven's will" and take no action. Everyone can imagine that in this situation, how can the rice harvest not decline?</p>
<p>The farmers laboriously harvested some rice, but in order to get cash to pay the land rent, repay debts, and meet taxes and levies, they were willing to accept the plummeting rice prices at the beginning of the new harvest season. They exchanged as much of the rice they had earned as possible for banknotes, under the pressure of rice merchants' price-cutting.</p>
<p>The lower the rice price, the more difficult the livelihood becomes. To solve the immediate crisis, they even sell the rice they should have saved for their own consumption. Even if some of the more astute farmers want to avoid the rice merchants' price-cutting and slowly sell the rice in the hope of exchanging it for more banknotes, reality tells them that once the authorities start buying food rice, rice merchants are absolutely prohibited from moving within the county area (not so according to law, but so in reality). Thus, they have to sell the rice with heartache.</p>
<p>Farmers should hand over a certain amount of food rice according to the price stipulated by the authorities. The Chinese farmers, who are very obedient, still transport the rice they are supposed to hand over to the designated collection agency, even though they know that the rice they need for themselves is not enough. When they get less cash than they were given by rice merchants, they often say with a forced smile: "They buy our rice at a low price, but they also sell farm tools, bean cakes, cotton cloth, soap, matches, and sugar to us at a low price."</p>
<p>In the previous peaceful times, ordinary farmers were already unable to make ends meet and were hard-pressed for money. Now, the number of fields cultivated has not increased, the harvest has declined, and under the rice merchants' price-cutting purchases and the authorities' fair-price purchases, the income in currency is even more insufficient to meet the necessary monetary expenditures. What's more, the population of each farm family is now larger than before, there are more extra donations and taxes than before, and the prices of daily necessities have skyrocketed. The multiple by which farmers' expenditures have increased exceeds the multiple by which their income has increased. It is unknown by how much. When the new harvest is not yet available, the poor farmers have no grain to last overnight. In order to survive, they have to borrow money or rice. Banks and money shops do not seem to treat farmers as customers, so farmers have to borrow money from local usurers at high interest rates of 100% to 300% per month and then buy the rice they need at prices that are several times higher than when they sold it. For example, this year they bought rice at a high price of several thousand yuan per stone, which they had sold last winter for 900 yuan per stone. Honest people borrow rice from those who have surplus rice in the local area. If they borrow one stone of rice in June or July, they have to return one stone and five dou of rice after the new harvest is available. In this way, the farmers naturally become poorer and poorer.</p>
<p>The shattered state of the countryside cannot be fully described in one or two thousand words. Even if it is described in detail, unless you have experienced it firsthand, you will never believe that there are such painful realities in the world. With the countryside so shattered, how can the rice supply avoid becoming the center of a serious problem!</p>
<p>We believe that the fundamental solution to the food problem in cities is still increased agricultural production. As for improving the purchase methods and the distribution system, they are only stopgap measures. Therefore, we hope: (1) The leaders and sponsors of the agricultural increased production movement will quickly take action, not just sit and manage, and immediately mobilize agricultural experts and students to guide farmers to improve their farming methods. (2) Establish rural financial institutions so that farmers can access capital at low interest rates and no longer be exploited by usurers. Urban idle capital may also be channeled into the right path through this. (3) When the authorities buy rice, it is best to adopt a system of advance rice payments. When the new harvest is not yet available and the farmers need cash most, pay a portion or all of the rice payment to the farmers in advance to adjust the seasonality of farmers' income and prevent farmers from relying on the whims of usurers. In this way, farmers will be more willing to obey the government's orders and sell the rice they have harvested at the stipulated price.</p>
<p>Proposal to Abolish Stamp Duty on Paper Money</p>
<h3>Supplementing the Education Fund</h3>
<p>— Chen Qi-xiong</p>
<p>If national education is not widespread, it is difficult to imagine the country's prosperity. Today, the education authorities have insufficient funds, and teachers' salaries are meager, which has a profound and far-reaching impact on the future of education. Therefore, there is a proposal to abolish stamp duty on paper money to supplement the education fund. The reasons are described below:</p>
<p>(Reasons) After legal tender circulates in the market, it is inevitably damaged and recovered by the national bank. "Waste paper money" refers to the damaged paper money that is recovered and not re-issued, but destroyed. The amount is so large that it is alarming, but it has not been noticed by the outside world. It amounts to tens of thousands of yuan per day. Therefore, after the implementation of stamp duty on waste paper money, the tax revenue will also be considerable. In the current situation, it is quite necessary to use it as an education fund. According to the fact that paper money is easily torn, soiled, gnawed by rats, burned by fire, or damaged by insects after use, within the stipulated scope, the national bank can exchange new currency for unlimited amounts without collecting any fees, which is very convenient. Therefore, general users are used to not paying attention and place the legal tender they hold at will, which makes it easy to damage or deliberately damage, which is very regrettable. However, there are no explicit regulations on how to cherish it. Now, the printing cost is more expensive than before. The consumption of damaged paper money is also a major expenditure for the government, and it should not be borne by the people. Therefore, those who hold damaged paper money should pay a considerable stamp tax and affix it to the damaged paper money, otherwise the national bank will not exchange it, and the store will not accept it. It must be affixed. If this can be done, not only will the loss of paper money be reduced, but the holder will know to cherish it, and the government can also reduce an expenditure. The number of damaged paper money held by individuals is very small, and the tax to be paid will not affect the individual economy. It can be done in one fell swoop, and it is hoped that public opinion circles will pay attention to and promote it.</p>
<p>The points to be discussed are listed below for reference.</p>
<p>(1) Stamp: Should the original stamp tax be used, or should a new design be made?</p>
<p>(1) Tax rate: The stamp should be determined by the size of the denomination. How should the base number be determined?</p>
<p>(1) Effect: After the stamp is affixed, should the damaged paper money be allowed to circulate in the market?</p>
<p>(1) Payment: How should the banks that receive the damaged paper money in batches know whether the stamp has been fully affixed or not?</p>
<p>(1) Implementation: After this method is drafted, who should submit it to the competent government department for approval and implementation?</p>

<h3>Free Drug Addiction Rehabilitation Center First Batch of Rehabilitated Individuals Released; Second Phase of Application Registration Begins</h3>
<p>The voluntary drug addiction rehabilitation center attached to the Zhong Jiao Dao Yi Society in Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road, has had its first batch of more than ten rehabilitated individuals, diligently treated by the doctors hired by the society, Yang Wei-wen, Sun Wei-rui, and Cai Da-ming. They were injected with "Sheng Kang Du Ping" injections produced by the Hua Sheng Pharmaceutical Research Institute, and various supplementary medicines were provided according to each person's illness. Since the implementation of the rehabilitation, the progress has been excellent. Not only has the addiction been broken, but also health has been restored. They were safely released yesterday. In order to express seriousness, the society notified the guarantors in advance to lead the rehabilitated individuals out of the center together. The Bishop and the two directors, Yang and Sun, and more than 30 guests jointly counseled them. The rehabilitated individuals gladly accepted. The ceremony ended and they dispersed. It is reported that the second phase of voluntary drug addiction rehabilitation has now begun registration. Any unemployed young people who are addicted to drugs and unable to reduce them can apply for registration at this office or the society in Fengyu Lane, Nantong Road.</p>
<h3>This Office Sells Two Major Beneficent Books</h3>
<p>"Protecting Wealth Method," written by layman Sun Jing-feng, is a masterpiece written during his illness, with profound meaning, enough to improve people's hearts. Last year, it was printed as a separate book, which was popular for a while. The first edition has been sold out. It has now been reprinted. The cost of each book is ten yuan, and the income will be used to subsidize the poor.</p>
<p>"Bright Lamp of the Outer World," also known as "Explanation of the White-Spoken Guanzhu of the Treatise on Actions and Retributions." The Treatise on Actions and Retributions is the oldest book in China to encourage goodness. Since the Jin and Tang Dynasties, it has been widely circulated from officials to women and children. The number of evils and good deeds mentioned is no less than one hundred and dozens. It is truly a wonderful classic for seeking good fortune and avoiding misfortune, and it is also a remarkable book suitable for troubled times.</p>
<p>Now, using the Guanzhu method, it is presented in fluent vernacular, integrating the original text and explanation into one, with a novel compilation method and clear meaning. It is printed by the Yuezhong Printing Society, and this office also sells it for five yuan per copy.</p>
<h3>Full Month Celebration Helps Obstetrics</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Chang-li, since it was his son's full month celebration yesterday, and he did not want to overspend, he specially donated the congratulatory gifts from relatives and friends, as well as the money saved from the full month celebration feast, to the student aid fund for 2,000 yuan, and also donated 1,000 yuan to this office for the obstetrics fund. Mr. Zhu's enthusiasm for public welfare is truly admirable. On behalf of the benefiting pregnant women, we extend our gratitude to him.</p>
<p>Also, Jin Ji Shang Ci Hui donated its February subsidy to this office's small loan fund. Now, it has once again donated the March subsidy of eighty yuan to benefit the poor and is deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Student Sentry Duty Problem</h3>
<p>Recently, the Lian Bao Office has always assigned student self-defense groups to stand guard during class time? Although several requests have been made, there has been no effect. The Bao chief always says: "I'm sorry, your son has already been assigned. There is no way to accommodate you, others will complain." If I go to stand guard myself, I will have to neglect my studies. If I have to spend 50 yuan each time, I am a poor unemployed person and cannot afford this expense. Moreover, according to the rules, the self-defense group should go to stand guard themselves, but the students have homework. They are the builders of the future motherland. Who can bear to sit by and watch them neglect their studies? I hereby request the Baojia authorities to be considerate of the students in the city and whether they can revoke the student sentry duty order? If it is impossible, please also notify the Lian Bao Offices to adjust the student sentry duty time as much as possible so that it does not conflict with class time. (Shen Qi-xian)</p>
<h3>Gift of Asthma Treatment Method</h3>
<p>Asthma is also known as phlegm asthma, also known as cough asthma. It is named after the symptoms, because the occurrence of asthma is mostly accompanied by coughing and wheezing. If it is not treated in time, the root of the disease will deepen day by day, the attacks will become more frequent, and the condition will become more serious, often becoming asthma. Lu Kui-sheng, a physician of internal medicine, has compiled a book entitled "Special Effective Quick Treatment Method for Asthma," which details the radical cure for asthma, dietary knowledge, special effective quick treatment methods for asthma, etc. Treatment in hot weather is most suitable. You can go to Lu Kui-sheng Clinic, 4, Lane 563, Weihaiwei Road (west of Zhengyang Road) to request it in person, or attach a postal letter to request it.</p>
<p>Sanhe Elementary School Recruits Free Students</p>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA, in order to rescue out-of-school children this year, has opened Sanhe Elementary School at 23 Sanhe Lane, Haifang Road, Xiaoshadu Road. The tuition fee is only half that of ordinary schools. Classes are held all day. There are grades from first to sixth grade. Each grade recruits 50 new students. Those whose families are indeed poor can have their tuition fees waived entirely.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Takeshi, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Blood and Tears (4)</p>
<p>"God is present in every military unit. It is even more necessary to worship God when sitting in a submarine, so of course there is one in the submarine."</p>
<p>The newly appointed Ensign said this, but in a room where even an inch of space cannot be easily spared, there is actually a tall, small white wooden shrine. A bottle of sake and blue poplar wood stand upright amidst the gray pipes and equipment.</p>
<p>Before firing a torpedo, one must first coat it with sake, and at the same time, it must be considered that submarines, which are often in danger, also rely on God for protection. And when I imagine the sailors who operate such complex and intricate machinery in front of the shrine, praying in a respectful posture, the husband says in his heart, it is truly a beautiful and powerful painting.</p>
<p>Sitting in the unmanned petty officer's room, the focus of the three people's conversation cannot but concentrate on submarines.</p>
<p>Concealment, range, independence - these are the characteristics of submarines, and at the same time these are the main factors of hardship and danger. If there is no concealment for submarines to approach the enemy, then such complex and intricate machinery and the training of people to become one, endurance and hard work, and the hardship of life in the submarine would not be necessary. If there is no long-distance voyage to the ocean, then there is no need to endure the rain-like humidity, ozone, and bland canned food in the submarine. In addition, when sailing with other ships, there is also the danger of early depth charges, which other friendly ships avoid. Submarines must bear all the hardships and dangers because they are submarines.</p>
<p>As for the tasks, there are patrols, breaking shipping lanes, shelling land, laying mines, etc., but the task itself lies in submarines stepping forward to fire torpedoes at enemy giant ships. In this case, isn't the submarine becoming an underwater torpedo boat? Doesn't the tradition of torpedo boats, which has shown the unique tactics of the Imperial Navy in Weihaiwei, Lushun, and the Sea of Japan, already extend to the bottom of the water?</p>
<p>The husband thought this over and over again in his heart.</p>
<p>"That's right, the spirit of torpedo boats and the spirit of submarines are fundamentally the same, but the form of expression may be different. In short, the spirit of Commander Sakuma is the pure spirit of the submarine fleet!"</p>
<p>Real person is publishing a theory that Longfu has never heard before.</p>
<p>Soon, the three did not leave the boat. The sunlight shot more fiercely and cruelly.</p>
<p>"Well, let's go to the colonel's place and listen to the various speeches!"</p>
<p>The newly appointed Ensign started walking towards the school dormitory, but Longfu went to see the cute little submarine used for underwater surveys again on the way, as a souvenir in his heart.</p>
<p>"Real person, it must be very interesting for such a small submarine to enter the enemy port with torpedoes."</p>
<p>Although Longfu was joking, the real person and Xintian suddenly faced each other dumbfounded, and could not speak for a while. (123)</p>
