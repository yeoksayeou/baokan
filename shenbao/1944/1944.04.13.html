<h3 id="c1">考選與銓叙 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們在十一日社評說過：監察彈劾，是澄淸吏治方法，考試銓叙，是健全人事方法。中國目前吏治的最大問題，是親朋援引，胥吏把持，分贓貪汚，所以改造吏治，第一要澄淸仕途，使貪官汚吏無從立腳，第二要樹立考銓制度，使眞才實學的人能够由考試制度而替國家做事，已經替國家做事的人，能夠由銓叙制度而有進陞的機會。第三要講求效率，使人盡其材，然後國家方能化最少數的金錢，以最少數的官吏，替老百姓做最多的事務。</p>
<p>考試的重要巳經是一般所明白的了，國民政府雖設有考試院，但是實除成效可說些微得很，其最大原因，就在一般官吏的任用，還是援引和請託。這樣，那個願意來應考。所以要健全考試制度，先得使考試及格的人都能够有職。要使應考的人數多，主持考試的人有興味，肯負責，考試及格的人必須立刻錄用。</p>
<p>銓叙的責任最要的有三點。一是甄別現任人員，定其適任與否。一是審査新進人員，定其應否任用。三是考績現任人員，定其獎懲。銓叙部的條例頒佈的巳經不少，可是銓叙部的工作不多，其最大的原因，就在銓釵部的沒有權力，各部各機關都不願意把他的人員送請銓叙，銓叙部自沒有法子强迫；銓叙部所審定的辦法，各部各機關都不依照實行，銓叙部自更沒有法子强制執行。所以要使銓叙有效，首先要使銓叙部有權，要使不經銓叙的人不能任用，要使銓叙決定的獎懲辦法立即執行，那末，健全人事這一件事差不多已經做到了十分之九。</p>
<p>孫中山先生規定考試權為五權之一，國民政府更規定考試權由考試院獨立行使，掌理考選·銓叙兩事，考試院對於各公務員之任用，除法律另有規定外，如査有不合法定資格時，得不經懲戒程序，逕請降免。可是，說來可憐，考試院那裹能够實行他的職權。在整個吏治沒有上軌道的時候，整個行政組織沒有脫離舊式窠白的時候，滿朝都是親戚故舊同鄕，單單考試院那裏能够負起這個責任。但是考試和銓叙，是促進賢明政治的唯一途徑，賢明政治又是復興中國最最緊要，最最必需的一件大事。假如我們願意中國復興，我們務必促成道個制度的成功。於此，我們希望現在賢明的長官先要以身作則，把部屬送請銓叙，遵從銓叙的意見，更將考試院分發考試及格的人員，加以任用，表示大公無私。我們希望考試院應當十分鄭重主持考選銓叙事務。我們更希望國人熱誠擁護這考選銓叙制度，作為行政改革的先鋒，做各方面的後盾。</p>

<p>東京十一日中央社電　印度前綫訊，猛攻伊姆法爾西北哥希馬公路最大要衝康古拉頓基與該地東南高地之日印同盟軍部隊，七日晚又利用月光，實行果敢壯烈之夜襲，於激戰後，終將該要衝完全佔領，目下正急追敗敵進攻，詳情如次：本月四日晚，向南部猛進之日軍部隊，於高地一帶獲取有利陣地，而與陸續到達之部隊一齊總攻康古拉頓基。自伊姆法爾方面，以戰車火砲前來攻擊之敵軍，恃有優秀之機械火器，仍不示弱，且發動飛機三十餘架，轉取空陸雙方之猛攻高地南北，兩方一時曾展開激戰。日印同盟軍將兵鑒於戰事刻不容緩，乃決意實行夜襲作戰，以七日夜間十二時為期，一氣殺進敵方主要陣地，終將敵軍堅陣一舉粉碎。</p>
<p>印緬前錢某地十二日中央社電　由頓札恩迫近伊姆法爾公路隘路口之日印軍各精銳部隊，於九日下午五時對據守該隘口之數百敵軍，由下北方地區展開包圍殲滅戰，當將該地佔領，在特爾本東北十公里沿路之部落，遭敵軍之砲火之攻擊，刻巳發生大火。又其他日軍各精銳部隊，亦急追殘敵軍，抵特爾本高地東方，將該方面敵軍迫退，伊姆法爾盆地敵遭日軍之猛攻，遺棄大批彈藥，奪路而逃，巳喪失戰意矣。</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　日印軍精銳刻向巴列爾東南十五公里之英眾主要陣地呑拿巴爾作壯烈之肉彈突擊，深入敵軍所築堅陣，北方日軍某兵團主力，亦藉大砲掩護，於十日午突入敵陣，相繼將其奪取制壓，敵陣之陷落在即，呑拿巴爾四周敵陣地崩壞，敵軍已狼狽混亂不堪。</p>
<p>緬甸某基地十二日中央社電　緬甸方而日陸軍航空部隊，九日拂曉急襲伊姆法爾北方敵軍機塲，敵機塲有一處中彈被毀，有六處發生大火，日機於達到目的後，即安然飛返基地。另一日轟炸機隊，十日强襲伊姆法爾用方敵機塲，對其滑走路集中投彈，予以澈底粉碎後，日機即安然飛返基地。</p>
<h3 id="c3">印國民軍幹部　談作戰感想 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　加拉頓戰綫奮戰中之印度國民軍，自日軍以破竹之勢進迫伊姆法爾以來，其士氣已益為振奮，於一日夜襲加拉頓南方門達溫一役，印度國民軍已收獲莫大戰果，同時更深切認識央軍之脆弱性，茲將該軍幹部與英西非軍作戰後所談感想如次：某中尉談，我等之作戰，乃係為自身而戰，為自由印度之解放而戰，我等已澈底覺悟，如不打倒英國，則祖國不得解放。故國民軍無不憤恨英國。由於日軍戰力之精銳，英勇之進擊，敵方牽無戰意之下，敵軍實不堪一擊，我等於經過幾度奮戰之今日，對我軍戰力之强大，巳具確信，我等將為求祖國之自由奮戰到底。薩爾達新中士談，余曾奮勇追擊西非黑人兵士，並將其刺倒，余更曾化裝黑人兵士，被一英人察破，以手槍射擊，至手掌受傷，但該英人旋即被我戰友擊斃，吾人所以能如此勇敢殺敵者，實皆因對日軍之必勝有深切之確信也。吾等與英軍作戰，雖尙係初次，但巳深知其不足為敵，日軍之英勇猶大，實為吾人所當效法之。布林頓上等兵談，於搜索英兵時，竟不見一人，但目睹戰友受傷之凄情，不禁憤火中燒，以捕殺敵人為快我等與日軍共同作戰，共同進擊實覺不勝愉快，但惜不能痛快殺敵，下次進擊，不容敵軍逃生，以為受傷戰友復仇。</p>

<h3 id="c6">民衆協力日軍　殲滅英傘兵　緬宣傳部長談述經過 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　英印軍以迭次敗戰，極為焦慮，乃謀擾亂日軍後方，曾於三月上旬派遣降落傘部隊空軍挺身隊，於北緬加藤附近降落，以期逞其所圖，經日軍及緬甸民衆協同在各地邀擊巳受重創，其被完全殲滅，僅為時日之問題。緬甸社會宣傳部長，十七日說明緬甸民衆協力日軍，殲滅敵空軍挺身隊情形如次：去年英軍進攻阿拉坎之際，阿拉坎當地民衆即自動協力日軍剿敵，本年阿拉坎作戰開始時，該地住民又協力日軍從事防禦，倍形努力。據北緬甸八莫地區塞科部落方面人士談稱：該部落一國民奉公隊員，於出外巡視中，忽與由一英人將校率領之印度兵二十五人遭遇（按即空軍挺身隊之一部），該奉公隊員，即將此批英印兵誘於村內，並　以飲食，以防其疑，飭其他奉公隊員五人，極速報吿當地日軍，旋由日兵五人及緬甸巡査隊將該批敵兵逮捕。又據八莫縣某村民衆稱：日軍於接獲敵軍三百人在該部落附近露營之消息後，日軍約三十人與當地村民馳抵敵兵營地，奮勇襲擊，當時敵軍雖衆，然卒不敵日軍，遣屍五十餘具，向密林地帶方面敗退。此外，於加薩方面，亦有同樣之事發生，日軍於接獲敵軍約千人企圖渡河，正强制村民之消息後，即由少數日軍在村民之援助下，痛擊敵軍，殺敵三百人，俘敵百人，予敵以重創。現在緬甸民衆尤其協力緬民衆，刻正組織國家奉公隊，防衛隊，防諜隊等，以期積極搜捕敵軍。又在八莫及加薩方面之敵俘，亦巳承認日印緬協力　緊密，某英人靑年將校曾口述稱：吾等來緬作戰，係奉畏官之命令，而吾人所預想不及者，厭為緬甸民衆，竟將吾人之行動報吿日軍，而與日軍協力，逮捕吾等。</p>

<p>— 今人</p>
<p>當一九四一年日本航空部隊，對珍珠港予以歷史性的大痛擊時，英國現役提督曾經破口大駡美國海軍的醜態，他說：「美海軍水兵竟抵不過英國捉魚船上的水手。」但是誰知道那位提督駡聲未絕，馬來海面上一幕悲慘又接連而起，英國的威爾斯親王號和雷相爾斯號相繼被日本海軍擊沉。於是美國報復的機會來了，全美國的報紙篇幅，滿足一片咒駡英國海軍的材料。在我們的腦海裏，恐怕還記得很淸楚吧，原來所謂英美兩國「始終不渝的友情」，祗能在戰况順利的時候勉强維持一下，如果戰局不順手，那麽狐狸尾巴就會顯出來，彼此互相痛駡詛咒，這完全是一種滑稽作風，就是這次日軍進攻印度，他們還是如此情形。</p>
<p>美國的不滿</p>
<p>仁巴爾的陷落，巳經成為旣定事實，被日軍切斷阿薩密鐵路的悲劇，亦將成為現實問題，這時候，英美間又各說對方的壞話，來發洩內心的憤懣，這裏舉出一個可以代表的例子，三月廿七日紐約太陽報華盛頓特派員電報說：「美國對於蒙特巴頓有種種不滿之聲浪，然一般人對彼仍寄與極大信仰，但最近印度政府對防衛印度一無積極行動，英政府至今尙不表示援助蒙特巴頓的誠意，此點實令人不滿」云。關於此事NBC的新聞解說記者乍配霖曾表一示他的見解。他說：照馬帕平原的戰况看，英國巳逢到第二新嘉坡，英國現在巳到以全部力量防衛印度的時機云云。他的措辭非常婉轉，但是骨子裏充滿諷刺。當然他們所說的，換句話就是說：「英國為什麼對於防衛印度一點沒有表示？」日軍切斷阿薩密鐵路如吿成功那麽就是夫公谿谷的勝利，到彼時斯蒂威爾部下的美軍，誠如八日曼澈斯特導報所稱不能以一兵一卒或一顆子彈接濟，萊多公路的建設工程，也不得不半途而廢，並可預料到斯蒂威爾的軍隊將被日軍緊緊園住，逢到全軍覆沒的命還。所以美國處處督促加强英國的防衛力量，並非沒有道理。最近美陸長史汀生會經公開說：「緬甸美軍的作戰目的僅在開通萊多公路。」他意思就說美國祗須專心顧到開關萊多公路，英國為協助建設公路，來檔住日軍兵力，受其擊潰。美國這種利己的論調英國當然大為不滿，英方認為在魁北克會談中，美國曾硬拉邱吉爾，雙方約定英美應一致反攻東亞，但此次對防衛印度，不出絲毫力量援助，用英印軍犧牲的血來貫通萊多公路，企圖在中國確立帝國主義的霸權。</p>
<p>英國的反駁</p>
<p>最近英國「新政治家」週報刋載一文，該文對美國利已的態度，加以一針見血的批評。據該報載稱；「美國厲稱蒙特巴頓與斯蒂威爾間意見水火，但是美國本身亦莫不如是，尼米茲與斯蒂威爾間亦各執成見。蓋尼米茲主張進攻南海，在福建省建造空軍根據地，企圖直搗日本本土，然斯蒂威爾主張貫通萊多公路，向中國大陸反攻。吾人試用冷靜態度觀察，為解除重慶的窘狀，採用尼米茲不能速達的戰略，是無濟於事的，打通萊多公路始為唯一捷徑。換句話說：美國以太平洋作戰目的轉向印度，派大軍赴印，以促萊多公路早日完成。」當然，「新政治家」週報文章的主旨，不外乎欲利用美國兵力加强防衛印度。</p>
<p>英美論調的衝突今後將隨日軍作戰進展而愈益激烈，此固可逆料的英美表面上口口聲聲說「友好關係不變」「密切共同作戰」，但是揭去他們的假面具，就可看見他們互相希望對方付重大犧牲而自己吸其甘露。</p>
<p>重慶的論調</p>
<p>上面未曾提到重慶，但這決非以為重慶並不參在狐與狸的陣綫內的關係，原來英美亦曾催促重慶軍參加緬甸作戰，但重慶。廿五日掃蕩報主張聯合軍應加强聯合軍在緬甸的軍事力量，他的主張是希望英美將兵力集中於印度，企圖使英美人儘量地流血來貫通萊多公路。</p>
<p>日軍此次印度作戰，含有種種重大意義。可使英美渝向東亞總反攻的企圖完全成了泡影。切斷萊多公路而使重慶更加困窘，並且可以推進印度民族運動，所謂在鞏固團結下的英美渝關係，巳在這裏讀出了本來面目。</p>

<p>— 羅素</p>
<p>四月十三日是有名的「阿姆立柴大屠殺」的紀念日。在一九一九年的這一天，把印度的人與資源騙使到歐洲戰塲上去，而答應給殷度人獨立的英國人，却給了他們皮鞭與砲火。這一次驚心動魄的慘劇發生在耶連瓦哈的近郊，印度人衆集在那裏紀念一個宗教的節目。這的確是印度人永遠不會忘記的一件事。</p>
<p>在這一個可紀念的日子，我們來談印度國民軍的問題，覺得是頗有意義的。</p>
<p>自由印度國民軍的存在</p>
<p>自由印度國民軍，在江特拉鮑斯指揮之下，歷史性的進入印度東部阿　姆，已經二十多天了。在這期間，敵方的宣傳者不斷的盡其全力歪曲與欺瞞日軍所造成的新事實。然而有一件事敵方的意傳機關所絕不涉及的。那就是自由印度國民軍的存在與行動。</p>
<p>假使我們談起印度國民軍，那麼不知道羞恥的反軸心宣傳家，就要說：「我們不理　自由印度國民軍，祇有日本人才常常談起。」</p>
<p>好的，我們姑且說這是對的。但是，自由印度國民軍究竟是什麼呢？自從一七五七年最後的自由印度國家，莫古爾王國在帕拉塞英勇的抵抗克立武爵士所率領的英軍，而潰亡之後，這是第一次印度人為印度而組織的軍隊開始行動。這支軍隊的領袖江特拉鮑斯氏—他的卓著的戰鬥事業，即使西門爵士與邱吉爾也不能不承認，而且這支軍隊並不是突然或被强迫在印度開始行動。那是依據一九四十年三月八日在孟買舉行的印度國民會議的決議，在那決議中，甘地曾對英國人發出「沒有武器的宣戰」；並且是答覆全部三萬萬印度人之無聲的要求。</p>
<p>無恥的反軸心宣傳家們或許要說：「噢，我們都知道了。但那都是日本的出品。」那些熱中於大西洋憲章，並且極冷淡地忽視民族慾望的熱情和神聖情緒的人們，當然有此種論調。然而，我想那或許會使他們驚駭的。</p>
<p>我曾說在不久以前，反軸心的宣專家們絕不談起自由印度國民軍。這話不完全是對的，因為有二個根據。第一個根據是三月二十五日華盛頓晚星報的社評所說的話，「說到緬甸，有一件現象我們覺得特別痛苦，那就是日本的軍隊中有印度國民軍參加着。的確，祇要印度軍進入印度的國境，可能使急進的印度獨立份子奮起的。」</p>
<p>第二個根據是四月十一日美國「下午報」的社評所說的話：「江特拉·鮑斯的進入印度國境，在印度獨立運動上，會有一種嚴重的後果。英國人必須立即釋放尼赫魯，並須進備應付或將發生的幾重事態」。</p>
<p>這些觀察差不多對的。在某程度內，我極贊成這些報紙的論調，因為他們關於印度軍的進入印度國境這一歷史的事實，是一種「常識」。假使這樣，那麼，倫敦和重慶，關於這事實的隱頭露尾，究竟是缺乏常識呢？還是另有用意？無疑的，那一定是後者。然則他們的用意何在？倫敦和新據里的用意是很顯然的，因為他們知道，不管印度人怎樣被他們鞭韃，祗要印度國民軍進入印度到某種程度，一定要影響到印度大衆的士氣與精神，而起來反抗英國的。這是極自然的。</p>
<p>重慶方面的態度</p>
<p>再着重慶的態度。在談及詳情之先，讓我們引一首中國的古詩：「煮豆燃豆萁，豆在釜中泣，本是同根生，相熊何太急」。蔣介石聽了這話作何感想。他自命為孫中山先生的繼承者，傳播大亞細亞主義。在「中國的命運」一書中闡釋亞洲意識者也是他。蔣介石對於這問題的答覆，不但和英美人與築萊杜公路來阻止印度人建立印度，不但屠戮緬甸人民，蹂躪緬甸土地，至少緬甸已獲得了國家的尊嚴與獨立；並且還參加協約軍與印度國民軍交戰。</p>
<p>在「中國的命運」一書中，蔣介石說：「中國的解放是依據一種穩健的和不可支配的民族情緒。」的確，這是對的。但在另一面，這樣神聖地，堅持民於情緒的蔣介石，在印度和緬甸所已做的和正在做的事情又將怎機解釋呢？這裹我發覺了重慶為什麼從來不談起印度國民軍的緣故。</p>
<p>最後，我們的結論是：印度國民軍所從事的民族解放，重慶沒有理由不承認。同樣，在重慶慶陳營中，也造或一種深刻而顯著的感覺，來考慮繼續抗戰的政策。</p>

<p>一方面希望巿民瞭解戰時防空的意義，為保護安全，養成臨事不慌張的習慣，認眞遵守一切防空規則，尤其是燈光遮蔽一點。一方面希望巿民防空本部當局隨時注意執行防空規則，對於窗戶燈光外洩，寶成保甲人員勸導糾正，務使居民養成遵守習慣。凡不遵守規則者，如不隨時糾正，則日久怠生，防空規則將等於具文，防空意義將無形消失。</p>

<h3 id="c39">日陸軍報道部　分析緬甸戰局　進攻印度意義重大 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>盟邦在滬陸軍報道當局，昨（十二）日於會見本巿中國新聞記者例會席上，由赤星囑託，對週來細甸戰况分析極為詳盡，茲誌其談話如左：</p>
<p>渝方之政策為「抗日戰爭」，利用抗日戰爭來爭取解放，這是他們的目的，但是軸心國方面，是為解放整個東亞而戰，東亞解放以後，中國當然亦得解決，此次進攻印度也就是解放東亞戰爭之一個步驟，故其在整個東亞之解放上，意義極為重大。因此進攻印度之戰役發動後，對協約方面，尤以英美渝三方面受影饗極為重大。此次進攻印度之戰爭發動以來，非常順利，業已佔領阿　密省之軍事根據地亦即交通要點，進而拔伊姆怯爾，已指日可待，致目下英美渝各方均感受極大恐慌。</p>
<p>進攻印度分五戰區</p>
<p>至於進攻印度作戰，在期何狀態之下發展，茲分五區述之。</p>
<p>「第一區」就是在阿拉坎地區，曾和英第七第五師展開血戰，現已將布其頓方面英軍第七師予以殲減，故在這一方面戰事可暫吿一段落。敵方曾竭力宣傳稱：「彼輩可從孟加拉灣方面登陸，企圖奪回緬甸，」但是萬一敵方眞從此處登陸，可謂徒然重演悲劇而巳。</p>
<p>「第二區」在加拉頓河流城，有敵方西菲土民軍第枚十一師，也為吾軍在開多，加拉頓之間，予以包圍殲減。</p>
<p>「第三區」在梯迭姆，頓扎恩之間之英印軍第十七師，亦加以包圍殲減。</p>
<p>「第四區」較第三區稍北之地區，就是馬林及達姆戰綫，即所謂緬甸國境中部的戰鬥，而現在這方面的戰鬥，吾人可稱之為「進攻印度之戰爭，」其意義更為深長。這一方面戰局是突破國境，以伊姆法爾，哥希為，為尼布爾為目標的進攻作戰，當地敵軍之配備為英印軍第二十師，第二十三師，及已經在梯迭姆方面遭吾軍圍殲後之殘餘部隊。</p>
<p>「第五區」即富貢地區。按此地區乃重慶反攻緬甸之根據地，所以戰爭特別劇烈，該區有重慶軍第二十二師，第三十師，第三十八師，及密爾上校所率之美軍二旅，以上所述即為敵方於雨季（五月）之前，所作之反攻。但以戰綫太長，無一貫之運緊性，故軍隊作戰極為零亂。考其原因，在於英美兩國及重慶之見解不一，因此於作戰上亦不統一，換言之，其作戰不能統一之原因，亦在於彼此作戰目標之各不相同，敵方於此種情形下作戰，其將遭受失敗，自屬意中之事。</p>
<p>伊姆法爾陷於孤立</p>
<p>至於目前由上述原因，敵方反攻緬甸之兵站根據地伊姆法爾，現早成為一孤立地區，所以使東印鐵道嚴重地感到有被截斷之威脅，敵方雖企圖以空輸部隊，來切斷細甸之鐵道，但此亦似飛蛾撲火，自投羅網而已。蓋日軍對伊姆法爾之進攻，極為猛烈，其地之機塲，已不能使用，敵方即使有此種行動，亦將陷於退無歸路。觀諸上述第五區之戰况，吾人可知敵方反攻最烈之地為富貢地區，蓋在富貢地區方面之淪軍，及英美軍，雖力國振作，數度蠢動，但迫於日軍猛烈進攻伊姆法爾牽制之故，終不得逞。倫敦孟却斯特報曾於四月八日社論中評述緬甸戰况稱：「自阿藤密鐵道經哥希馬而達伊姆法爾一綫，已不幸為日軍截斷二處，而且日軍巳進軍至相距此鐵道僅四十哩之西部地帶，此鐵道若一旦為日軍所截，則不但使在富貢漢谷地區作戰之斯蒂威爾的軍隊，陷於絕境，即對里度公路之工程，亦將因此無怯供應材料，而不能繼續」云云。</p>
<p>渝方引起重大反響</p>
<p>在如此情形之下重慶方面業已引起重大之反響。據悉重慶大公報，於于四月五日載稱：「在緬甸方面作戰之英軍，並無值得吾人注意之行動，在東南亞細亞負責作戰之英軍，憑其進行，應做出超過目前的行動」云云，同時重慶的共產黨機關報的「新華日報」，亦於同日發我極不滿的言論，謂在雲南西部的淪軍，目觀斯狀，為何亦竟按兵不動，對於伊姆法爾戰情，業如上述，茲更就其重要性加以分析。三月二十四日東南亞細亞聯合總司令部曾宣稱：「任何人如能確保伊姆怯爾，則使向富貢進攻之斯蒂威爾部隊，將感受交通之威脅。日印軍並肩進攻之下，對印度方面之作戰非常重視，所以日軍佔領伊姆法爾已不成問題。若該地一旦陷落，則英美渝企圖奪回緬甸之計劃，將成泡影，即英美亦無法對緬甸再有所蠢動，至於重行開闢緬甸公路，當成絕望，自不待言。渝方目前所關心者，乃欲利用反攻緬甸而重闢緬甸公路，以接外國之接濟，美國方面則企圖藉此重闢緬甸公路後可以派造在淪美軍增强其力量，以遂其借中國大陸進攻日本之野心。英國方面之所以力圖作戰勝得，乃企圖重行壓迫印度而已。現在此種戰局，敵方英美渝三者之間，目標均集中於緬甸，然而因日軍猛攻之結果，予三者以重大之打擊，其次緬印之戰，於政治上更有一種意義，即侃印軍表現其足以扶植其政府之力量，而建立强固之獨立政府。</p>
<p>經濟界　經濟評言</p>
<h3 id="c40">增產總動員麼？ <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>汪主席在今年元旦訓詞中開始一句話，就是「今年的一年應該是增產運動總動員的一年」。時光易逝，所謂今年增產年，已將逝去三分之一，若問增產運動實行了總動員麼，那末，主席所說過的幾句話，便覺字字足以使我人大家反躬自省了！他說過：「過剩的游資應該用之於增產，不事生產的人力應該用之於增產，業餘的時間應該用之於增產，過份的享受，無謂的消耗應該盡量節約用之於增產，日常用品以及農工商各業剩餘的廢物也應該收集起來用之於增產」。</p>
<p>上面所引述的幾句話，大家總該覺得言猶在耳罷，可是，事實所吿訴我們的，恰如前日本報短評之所描寫，顯然還是與主席所訓示與期待者，居於一個矛盾的地位，所以我們希望企業家一致移轉其一部份實力於手工業之興辦，其主觀的作用，固在於利用過剩的游資，不事生產的人力，業餘的時間以及無謂的消耗，使其不復成為生虫的腐物，但其客觀的作用，則在於推進人民日用必需各部門之生產，使其能够自給自足。據我們所知道的，手工業在廣東近年是佔有重要位置的：自從三十一年開始設立各種手工藝廠以來，其手工業即分為編織，機織，化學工藝，及竹木工四部，而其主要的生產即為棉布與毛巾，並且無日不是在積極增高生產中，這正是我們華中一帶所當取法的。所以。增產運動如果還不總動員的話，則農業增產而外，請從速自興辦手工業始！</p>

<p>懷着滿腔愉快的情緒，在大西路憶定盤路步行着，仰頭數着門牌，「六十六號」，啊，到了！走進了鐵門，迎面就是一座高大的洋房界立着，外貌頗為壯觀。近臺階前攔上了一圈竹籬笆，院落裏靜悄悄地沒有聲息。從旁門繞了進去，由一位身着白衣的護士請我進了辦公室，該所主持人，是一位很年輕的小姐——竺佩恩，可是從她的談吐和態度中，使人看得出刻的幹統和有能力。我巡視全屋，這是一件很寬敞的辦公室，牆上掛着許多製圖列表的鏡框，足以說明本所的一切體構·組織·工作情形及服務成績的。還掛有許多兒童讀書·遊戲·課外活動。健康檢查的照片，裝點得這間屋子，似乎在科學化的佈置中，又帶有美術化的風味了！</p>
<p>內幕情形</p>
<p>本所共收留一百位兒童，五十九各男，四十一個女，入所的手績，須經過健康檢查，智力測騐，並須有介紹人與保證人方為合格。本所共有兩位敎師，三位保姆，十七位誠士，和七位工人，辦理的原則是力求平民化，科學化，教育化和家庭化的。據說所裹的兒童，都是自己洗手洗臉，自己吃飯穿衣，四五歲的孩子，從小就能養成自助和負責的好習慣，而且因為是集體生活，所以也易養成互助合作的精神與態度。所中對於兒童的健康也很注意，可有充足的營養，新鮮的空氣和陽光，以及充分的睡眠，至於經費的籌劃可分募捐與認捐兩方面來說，前者指由女靑年會推動寡築的，後者是讀者大衆都可效力的。只要是對托兒所運動有與趣而願認捐者，可以兒童人數為單位，每人每月認捐給養費一百元，每年一千二百元，該所對捐款人且訂有榮譽紀念辦法的，（在這裏筆者謹代他們求援，希望熱心人士，能够多多救助才好。）</p>
<p>各種特色</p>
<p>詳細地探詢了本所得一切之後，便由竺女士陪同參觀各處，拾級登樓，先有「臥室」，（據說全所共有八間，另有遊戲室三間，盥洗室一間，療養室一間，隔離室兩間和一間廚房，規模不算小。）推開一間臥室的門，陽光照在小鐵床上，整齊的行列，潔白的被單，再加上柔和恬靜的氣氛，眞使人有置身醫院中之感丁小鐵床多半是單人睡的，另置有較大較矮的床，是備給年齡較小的兩個兒童，便於自動爬上去合睡的，還有幾加架床欄上懸有一方銅牌，刻着捐贈人的姓名以資紀念，看了後，給了我一個「整潔簡撲」的印象。又到「盥洗室」，一排排的木架上，放着一隻隻的編號面盆漱口罐，手巾都掛在鈎子上，據說每日傍晚須由女工拿來沙爾重洗一遍的。這裏還有一個特色，就是十幾位護士都一律穿白衣，大有醫院風光的。</p>
<p>走進了「療義室」，陽光非常充足，空氣也很新鮮，據說此間是留給病後兒童養息住的，往參觀「隔離室」，幾個正害傳染病的孩子靜靜地躺在床上，有的護士和害皮膚病的孩子包紮着，聽設近來各託兒所裏的兒童，都在害着這種流行病，英文名呌Munips中文名耳腺炎，土語就呌「猪腮腫」，兒童間傳染起來是很厲害，據說男孩如害得太重是會影響到將來生育的，病情的嚴重可知了。</p>
<p>又參觀了「遊戲室」汽車壞了，高高地放到樹頂上，脚路車輸盤也掉了。，須待修理。別的都是些極簡單的玩具，在這裏筆者也代他們呼求，請各界捐贈些兒女玩舊的玩膩的，但却足以啟發兒童智力的積木，棋類，球類等玩具為托兒造福才好。</p>
<p>臨別留言</p>
<p>最後，臨別時，我對竺女士表示欽佩她們服務的熱忱與耐勞的精神，可是她微笑着回答：「……我們精神上的報酬是很大的呢！」的確，為兒童們服務，第一要有興趣，第二要有耐性，旣要有愛心，又要有熱力，具備了這些條件，才配做兒童的慈母呢！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Examination, Selection and Enlistment <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We said in our editorial on the 11th that monitoring and impeachment are methods to purify officialdom, while examination, selection, and enlistment are methods to improve personnel systems. The biggest problem with officialdom in China today is the recommendation of relatives and friends, the control by clerks and underlings, and the distribution of spoils and corruption. Therefore, to reform officialdom, the first step is to purify the path to officialdom, so that corrupt officials have no foothold. The second is to establish an examination and enlistment system, so that people with real talent and learning can serve the country through the examination system, and those who are already serving the country can have opportunities for promotion through the enlistment system. The third is to emphasize efficiency, so that everyone can make the most of their talents. Only then can the country use the least amount of money and the fewest officials to do the most for the people.</p>
<p>The importance of examinations is already generally understood. Although the National Government has established an Examination Yuan, its actual effectiveness can be said to be very minimal. The biggest reason for this is that the appointment of general officials still relies on recommendations and requests. In this case, who would be willing to take the exam? Therefore, to improve the examination system, people who pass the exam must be able to get a job. To increase the number of people taking the exam, those who administer the exam must be interested and willing to take responsibility, and those who pass the exam must be hired immediately.</p>
<p>The most important responsibilities of enlistment are threefold. The first is to assess current personnel to determine whether they are suitable for their positions. The second is to review new personnel to determine whether they should be hired. The third is to evaluate current personnel to determine their rewards and punishments. Many regulations of the Enlistment Department have been promulgated, but the work of the Enlistment Department is not much. The biggest reason for this is that the Enlistment Department has no power. Various departments and agencies are unwilling to send their personnel for enlistment, and the Enlistment Department has no way to force them. The methods determined by the Enlistment Department are not implemented by various departments and agencies, and the Enlistment Department has no way to enforce them. Therefore, to make enlistment effective, the Enlistment Department must first have power, so that people who have not gone through enlistment cannot be hired, and the reward and punishment methods decided by enlistment must be implemented immediately. Then, the task of improving personnel will be almost nine-tenths complete.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen stipulated that the power of examination is one of the five powers. The National Government further stipulated that the power of examination should be exercised independently by the Examination Yuan, which is in charge of examination, selection, and enlistment. For the appointment of various civil servants, unless otherwise stipulated by law, if it is found that they do not have the legal qualifications, the Examination Yuan may directly request demotion or dismissal without disciplinary procedures. However, sadly, the Examination Yuan is unable to exercise its powers. When the entire officialdom is not on track, when the entire administrative organization has not broken away from the old-fashioned patterns, and when the entire court is full of relatives, old friends, and fellow villagers, how can the Examination Yuan alone bear this responsibility? But examination and enlistment are the only way to promote enlightened politics, and enlightened politics is the most important and most necessary thing for the revival of China. If we want China to revive, we must promote the success of this system. Here, we hope that the current wise leaders will first lead by example, send their subordinates for enlistment, follow the opinions of the enlistment, and appoint personnel who have passed the examination distributed by the Examination Yuan, showing impartiality and selflessness. We hope that the Examination Yuan should solemnly administer the examination and enlistment affairs. We also hope that the people of the country will enthusiastically support this examination and enlistment system, as the pioneer of administrative reform and the backing of all aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese-Indian Troops Occupy Kanglatongbi in Moonlight Night Attack; Heavily Bomb Imphal Enemy Airfield <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - From the Indian Front: The Japanese-Indian allied forces, fiercely attacking Kanglatongbi, the largest strategic point on the Kohima-Imphal highway northwest of Imphal, and the highlands southeast of that location, again utilized moonlight on the evening of the 7th to carry out a bold and heroic night attack. After fierce fighting, they finally completely occupied this strategic point and are currently pursuing the defeated enemy. The details are as follows: On the evening of the 4th of this month, Japanese troops advancing fiercely to the south acquired advantageous positions in the highlands and launched a general attack on Kanglatongbi together with successively arriving troops. The enemy troops attacking from Imphal with tanks and artillery relied on their superior mechanical weapons and did not show weakness. They also dispatched over 30 aircraft to launch a fierce attack on the highlands from both the air and land. The two sides engaged in fierce fighting for a time. Recognizing the urgency of the situation, the Japanese-Indian allied forces decided to carry out a night attack operation. Starting at 12:00 AM on the night of the 7th, they charged into the enemy's main positions in one go, ultimately smashing the enemy's strongholds in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Indo-Burma front, 12th (Central News Agency) - The elite units of the Japanese-Indian forces approaching the bottleneck of the Imphal highway from Tonzang launched an encirclement and annihilation battle against several hundred enemy troops defending the bottleneck at 5:00 PM on the 9th, occupying the area. A fire broke out in a village 10 kilometers northeast of Terben, along the road, due to enemy artillery fire. Other elite Japanese units are also rapidly pursuing the retreating enemy troops, reaching the east of the Terben highlands, forcing the enemy troops in that area to retreat. The enemy in the Imphal basin, under the fierce attack of the Japanese forces, abandoned a large amount of ammunition and fled, having lost their will to fight.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - Elite Japanese-Indian troops are currently carrying out a heroic suicide attack on the main British stronghold of Tonupal, 15 kilometers southeast of Palel, penetrating deep into the enemy's fortified positions. The main force of a certain Japanese army corps in the north, under the cover of artillery, also broke into the enemy's positions on the afternoon of the 10th, successively capturing and suppressing them. The fall of the enemy's positions is imminent. The enemy's positions surrounding Tonupal are collapsing, and the enemy troops are in a state of chaos.</p>
<p>A certain base in Burma, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army air force on the Burma front launched a surprise attack on the enemy's airfield north of Imphal at dawn on the 9th. One part of the enemy airfield was hit and destroyed, and six locations caught fire. The Japanese aircraft safely returned to base after achieving their objectives. Another Japanese bomber squadron launched a strong attack on the enemy airfield used by Imphal on the 10th, concentrating their bombs on its runway and thoroughly destroying it. The Japanese aircraft then safely returned to base.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Indian National Army Cadre Discuss Battle Experiences <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The morale of the Indian National Army fighting on the Kaladan front has been increasingly boosted since the Japanese army's rapid advance towards Imphal. The Indian National Army achieved great results in the night attack on Myintha, south of Kaladan, and deeply recognized the vulnerability of the British army. The following are the impressions of the army's cadres after fighting against the British and West African troops: A certain lieutenant said, "Our battles are for ourselves, for the liberation of a free India. We are fully aware that unless we defeat the British, our motherland cannot be liberated. Therefore, the National Army hates the British. Due to the Japanese army's elite combat power and heroic attacks, the enemy has no will to fight and is easily defeated. After several battles, we are confident in the strength of our army. We will fight to the end for the freedom of our motherland." Sergeant Sarda Singh said, "I bravely pursued and stabbed a West African black soldier. I also disguised myself as a black soldier but was discovered by a British man who shot me in the hand with a pistol, injuring me. However, the British man was immediately killed by my comrades. The reason why we can kill the enemy so bravely is that we have deep confidence in the inevitable victory of the Japanese army. Although this is our first time fighting against the British army, we already know that they are not to be feared. The bravery of the Japanese army is even greater and should be emulated by us." Private Brinton said, "When searching for British soldiers, we couldn't find a single one, but seeing the miserable situation of wounded comrades, we couldn't help but feel furious and wanted to capture and kill the enemy. We are very happy to fight and advance together with the Japanese army, but it is a pity that we cannot kill the enemy thoroughly. In the next attack, we will not allow the enemy to escape and will avenge our wounded comrades."</p>

<h3 id="e6">Civilians Cooperate with Japanese Army to Annihilate British Paratroopers; Burmese Minister of Propaganda Discusses the Process <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency) - The British-Indian army, extremely anxious due to repeated defeats, attempted to disrupt the Japanese army's rear. In early March, they dispatched paratroopers and air force assault teams to land near Katha in northern Burma, hoping to achieve their goals. However, they suffered heavy losses after being ambushed by the Japanese army and Burmese civilians in various locations. Their complete annihilation is only a matter of time. The Burmese Minister of Social Propaganda explained the situation of Burmese civilians cooperating with the Japanese army to annihilate the enemy air force assault team on the 17th as follows: When the British army attacked Arakan last year, local civilians in Arakan voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese army to suppress the enemy. When the Arakan operation began this year, the residents of the area again cooperated with the Japanese army in defense, doubling their efforts. According to people from the Seiko tribe in the Bhamo region of northern Burma, a member of the tribe's National Service Corps encountered 25 Indian soldiers led by a British officer (part of the air force assault team) during an outdoor patrol. The service corps member lured this group of British-Indian soldiers into the village and provided them with food and drink to prevent them from becoming suspicious. He ordered five other service corps members to quickly report to the local Japanese army. Subsequently, five Japanese soldiers and the Burmese police team arrested the group of enemy soldiers. Furthermore, according to a villager in Bhamo County, after the Japanese army received information that 300 enemy soldiers were camping near the village, about 30 Japanese soldiers and local villagers rushed to the enemy camp and launched a brave attack. Although the enemy soldiers were numerous, they were ultimately no match for the Japanese army, leaving behind more than 50 corpses and retreating towards the dense forest area. In addition, similar events occurred in the Gaza area. After the Japanese army received information that about 1,000 enemy soldiers were attempting to cross the river and were forcing the villagers, a small number of Japanese soldiers, with the help of the villagers, fiercely attacked the enemy soldiers, killing 300 and capturing 100, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Currently, Burmese civilians are especially cooperating with the Burmese people and are organizing National Service Corps, defense teams, and anti-espionage teams to actively search for enemy soldiers. Furthermore, enemy prisoners in Bhamo and Gaza have also admitted that Japanese, Indian, and Burmese cooperation is very close. A certain young British officer verbally stated: "We came to Burma to fight under orders from our superiors, but what we did not expect was that the Burmese civilians would report our actions to the Japanese army and cooperate with the Japanese army to arrest us."</p>

<h3 id="e10">That's All There Is to the United Nations <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— By a Contemporary Person</p>
<p>When the Japanese air force launched its historic massive attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, a serving British admiral openly scolded the shameful state of the American navy, saying: "American sailors are no match for the sailors on British fishing boats." But who knew that before that admiral's scolding had died down, another tragic scene unfolded in the seas off Malaya, with the British battleship Prince of Wales and the battlecruiser Repulse being sunk one after the other by the Japanese navy. Then came America's opportunity to retaliate, with the entire American press filling its pages with material cursing the British navy. We probably still remember it very clearly, that the so-called "unwavering friendship" between Britain and America could only be maintained with difficulty when the war situation was favorable. If the war situation was not going well, then the fox's tail would be revealed, and they would curse each other bitterly. This is a completely farcical approach, and the situation is the same this time with the Japanese attack on India.</p>
<p>American Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The fall of Imphal has already become a fait accompli, and the tragedy of the Assam Railway being cut off by the Japanese army is also becoming a real problem. At this time, Britain and America are again saying bad things about each other to vent their inner frustrations. Here is an example that can represent this: a telegram from the Washington correspondent of the New York Sun on March 27th said: "There are various voices of dissatisfaction in America towards Mountbatten, but the general public still places great faith in him. However, the British government has not shown sincerity in assisting Mountbatten, which is frustrating, and the Indian government has taken no active action to defend India." Regarding this matter, NBC news commentator Chapelin expressed his views. He said: "Judging from the situation on the Ma Paing plain, Britain has encountered a second Singapore, and Britain has now reached the point of defending India with all its might." His wording was very euphemistic, but full of sarcasm. Of course, what they are saying, in other words, is: "Why hasn't Britain shown any effort in defending India?" If the Japanese army succeeds in cutting off the Assam Railway, then it will be a victory in the Hu Kong Valley. At that time, the American troops under Stilwell, as the Manchester Guardian reported on the 8th, will not be able to receive even a single soldier or a single bullet in supplies. The construction project of the Ledo Road will also have to be abandoned halfway, and it can be predicted that Stilwell's army will be tightly surrounded by the Japanese army, meeting the fate of total annihilation. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for the United States to constantly urge the strengthening of Britain's defense capabilities. Recently, US Secretary of War Stimson publicly said: "The purpose of the US military operation in Burma is only to open up the Ledo Road." What he meant was that the United States only needs to focus on opening up the Ledo Road, and Britain should assist in the construction of the road by blocking the Japanese army, suffering its defeat. Britain is naturally greatly dissatisfied with this selfish argument of the United States. The British side believes that during the Quebec Conference, the United States had forcibly pulled Churchill, and both sides had agreed that Britain and the United States should jointly counterattack East Asia. However, this time, they are not providing any assistance in the defense of India, and are using the blood of the British and Indian armies to connect the Ledo Road, attempting to establish an imperialist hegemony in China.</p>
<p>British Rebuttal</p>
<p>Recently, the British weekly "New Statesman" published an article that sharply criticized the United States' selfish attitude. According to the report, "The United States claims that there is discord between Mountbatten and Stilwell, but the United States itself is no different. Nimitz and Stilwell also hold their own opinions. Nimitz advocates attacking the South China Sea and building air force bases in Fujian Province, attempting to directly attack the Japanese mainland, while Stilwell advocates connecting the Ledo Road and launching a counterattack on the Chinese mainland. If we observe with a calm attitude, adopting Nimitz's strategy, which cannot be achieved quickly, to relieve Chongqing's predicament is of no use. Opening up the Ledo Road is the only shortcut. In other words, the United States is turning its Pacific operations towards India, sending a large army to India to expedite the completion of the Ledo Road." Of course, the main point of the "New Statesman" weekly article is nothing more than wanting to use American military strength to strengthen the defense of India.</p>
<p>The conflict in British and American arguments will intensify as the Japanese military operations progress. This is certainly predictable. Britain and America verbally say "unchanging friendly relations" and "close joint operations" on the surface, but removing their masks, we can see that they mutually hope that the other side will make major sacrifices while they themselves absorb the benefits.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Argument</p>
<p>Chongqing has not been mentioned above, but this is by no means to imply that Chongqing is not involved in the fox's and raccoon's line of relationships. Originally, Britain and America had also urged the Chongqing army to participate in the Burma operation, but Chongqing. On the 25th, the "Sweeping Report" advocated that the Allied forces should strengthen their military presence in Burma. His argument was that he hoped that Britain and America would concentrate their forces in India, attempting to make the British and Americans bleed as much as possible to connect the Ledo Road.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's current operation in India has various major implications. It can completely shatter the British, American, and Chongqing's attempt to launch a general counterattack in East Asia. Cutting off the Ledo Road makes Chongqing even more embarrassed and can promote the Indian national movement. The so-called British, American, and Chongqing relationship under consolidated unity has revealed its true colors here.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The candidate for Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan's Agricultural Production Promotion Council has been decided and approved by yesterday's Executive Yuan meeting, with Huang Jin appointed. A reporter specially visited Mr. Huang yesterday (the 12th) to inquire about the council's future work plans and the current work priorities. He replied as follows: "The council's future work will still be carried out step by step according to the established plans, focusing on practical work, and striving to seek agricultural production increase, living up to the meaning of the state's establishment of this council. The need for agricultural fertilizers during the summer plowing season is extremely urgent, so the council's current work also pays great attention to this point and is considering the distribution quantity and price of agricultural fertilizers. Regarding the distribution of chemical fertilizer ammonium sulfate, the quantity will be appropriately increased compared to last year. In previous years, a large amount of ammonium sulfate fertilizer flowed into the interior, which affected the high market price. Currently, the black market price reaches as high as 150,000 yuan per ton. The distribution of ammonium sulfate in this city must ensure that it is truly sold to farmers for use in increasing agricultural production and absolutely does not allow for the exploitation of farmers or illegal profiteering in the middle. This afternoon, the council will hold a meeting, and there will be concrete decisions on this issue."</p>

<h3 id="e19">German Forces Take the Initiative, Defend Eastern Europe with All Their Strength, Germany Announces Retreat from Kovel <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Renowned German military commentator Lieutenant General Dittmar said in a broadcast yesterday that the Soviet forces fighting between Stanislaviv and Kovel have lost their initiative. If the Soviet forces were to occupy this area, their power would inevitably be very strong, as this is historically the main route into Europe. However, the initiative, which is the main prerequisite for military success, is no longer in the hands of the Soviet forces. The German army's relief of the troops besieged in Kovel is an important symbol, showing that the German army's offensive and defensive capabilities are increasing. The defense of Kovel proves that the German army's defensive strength remains intact, and the lifting of the siege of the city indicates the German army's offensive power. The German army upstream of the Dniester River rescued its besieged infantry to join forces with the main German force coming from the west. This is also very important. A connection was established from Stanislaviv to the line west of Kamenets-Podolsky, and the German front line has been pushed far to the east. The Soviet forces' goal was to force the powerful German forces to the Black Sea coast to encircle and annihilate them, but the German forces have been able to contain this Soviet attempt. Although the retreat from Odesa is regrettable, it is unavoidable under such circumstances. Therefore, the territory of Greater Romania will be defended with all efforts. The rumors spread by the enemy and neutral parties that the German army specifically abandoned the two countries of Romania and Hungary are strategically foolish actions. The Germans will keep their promise.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) The German News Agency quoted an official German war report as saying that in the northern part of the Crimean Peninsula, the German-Romanian Allied forces broke free from the enemy in fierce fighting and retreated to the southern positions. After destroying all military facilities, the German army has withdrawn from the city of Kovel. The Soviet army is pressing hard and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with it. German troops at Ovidiopol (east of the mouth of the Dniester River) repelled a strong enemy offensive and annihilated its vanguard. Northeast of Orhei and Iași, the Soviet army launched an offensive to break through with the assistance of tanks, but it was ineffective. Between Stanislaviv and Ternopol, the German-Hungarian Allied forces broke through the enemy's stubborn resistance and occupied several villages. The German forces in Kovel have dispersed and attacked many groups of enemy forces.</p>

<h3 id="e21">U.S.-Turkish Trade Agreement Negotiations Break Down <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 12th (Central News Agency) Although the U.S. government has effectively banned exports to Turkey under the Lend-Lease Act, U.S. representatives have frequently negotiated with Turkish representatives in Ankara for a trade agreement. According to the Istanbul News Agency, it is reported that the Turkish government has announced that the negotiations have broken down. During the negotiations, Turkish representatives requested short-term delivery from the United States, but U.S. representatives, citing the difficulties of the U.S. military industry and domestic needs, insisted on a delivery period of 30 months. As a result, the two sides failed to reach an agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e22">American Planes Attack Germany in Broad Daylight, Shooting Down Over a Hundred, New Tactics of the German Air Force Succeed <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency reports: Yesterday afternoon, German air defense forces shot down over a hundred American planes over northern and central Germany. German fighters and destroyers repeatedly attacked the invading American four-engine bombers with great success. Ground artillery also provided effective support. The dogfights between fighters were particularly active. Reports of numerous American planes crashing and being forced to land in the southeastern area of Berlin have been received, while observation posts throughout the northern foothills of the Harz Mountains in central Germany reported that enemy planes dropped large numbers of bombs and fled. The enemy planes returned at approximately 1:00 PM, while the intrusion into German airspace occurred at 11:00 AM. A portion of the enemy planes was forced to flee between Braunschweig and Hanover. As for the American planes invading via the Baltic Sea, they were intercepted by German planes before reaching the Pomeranian coast.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency reports: When American planes attacked Germany yesterday morning, German planes launched collective attacks on the invading American planes, but engaged them individually when the enemy planes returned. German anti-aircraft fire was also very effective. American planes invaded German territory from the northwest and north, with several groups intruding into the vicinity of Berlin. The incoming planes all flew at high altitude and sought cover in the clouds over central and northern Germany.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) The U.S. Air Force Command announced: Large formations of American planes attacked mainland Germany on the 11th in broad daylight. In this battle, 64 bombers and 16 fighters were lost.</p>
<p>900 British Planes Bomb French and Belgian Railways</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) London reports: The British Air Ministry announced on the 11th that 900 British bombers bombed railway targets in France and Belgium on the night of the 10th. In this operation, 22 planes were lost.</p>
<p>British and American Plane Losses in the First Quarter of This Year Total 3,300</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) German authorities announced on the 11th that although air battles have reached their peak in the past year, air defense forces have consistently achieved great results, and the number of planes shot down from the anti-Axis forces has doubled compared to June of last year. German military factories have mass-produced new fighters in the past few months, so when the anti-Axis air force subsequently bombed Europe, especially when bombing mainland Germany, they often suffered extremely heavy damage. In March alone, the confirmed British losses amounted to 1,234 planes. If the losses since January are accumulated, they actually total 3,315 planes. Among the enemy planes shot down, 80 percent were four-engine bombers. The anti-Axis air force has lost over 22,600 pilots since the beginning of this year alone.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Soviet Union Extremely Dissatisfied with Wavering Attitude of Britain and the United States <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) The southern front of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase due to the continued Soviet offensive. However, Britain and the United States still refuse to form a second front, so there is a great risk that relations between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States will deteriorate. It is rumored that the Soviet authorities may make important strategic decisions in the near future. The Soviet weekly "War and the Working Class" published an article yesterday by Colonel Tolchanov, which strongly criticized the anti-Axis powers for delaying the opening of a second front in Western Europe. The article stated that the long-term fighting of the Soviet army against the main German forces has allowed the Allied powers to stockpile sufficient ammunition and reserve military strength. If Britain and the United States believe that accumulating large amounts of ammunition is enough to frighten Germany, they are simply daydreaming.</p>
<h3 id="e25">The Indian National Army and the Chongqing Regime <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Russell</p>
<p>April 13th is the anniversary of the famous "Amritsar Massacre." On this day in 1919, the British, who had deceived the Indian people and resources into serving on the European battlefields and promised independence to the Indian people, instead gave them whips and artillery fire. This shocking tragedy occurred in the suburbs of Jallianwala Bagh, where Indians gathered to commemorate a religious festival. This is indeed something the Indian people will never forget.</p>
<p>On this memorable day, it feels particularly meaningful to discuss the issue of the Indian National Army.</p>
<p>The Existence of the Free Indian National Army</p>
<p>The Free Indian National Army, under the command of Chandra Bose, has historically entered Imphal in eastern India for more than 20 days. During this time, enemy propagandists have constantly done their best to distort and deceive about the new facts created by the Japanese army. However, there is one thing that the enemy's propaganda machine will never touch upon, and that is the existence and actions of the Free Indian National Army.</p>
<p>If we talk about the Indian National Army, then the shameless anti-Axis propagandists will say: "We don't care about the Free Indian National Army, only the Japanese talk about it all the time."</p>
<p>Okay, let's just say that's right. But what exactly is the Free Indian National Army? Since 1757, when the last free Indian nation, the Mughal Empire, collapsed after bravely resisting the British forces led by Clive at Plassey, this is the first time an army organized by Indians for India has begun to act. The leader of this army, Chandra Bose—whose outstanding military career even Sir Simon and Churchill cannot deny—and this army did not suddenly or forcibly begin to act in India. It was based on the resolution of the Indian National Congress held in Bombay on March 8, 1940, in which Gandhi issued a "declaration of war without weapons" to the British; and it is in response to the silent demands of all 300 million Indians.</p>
<p>Shameless anti-Axis propagandists may say: "Oh, we know all about that. But it's all made in Japan." Those who are enthusiastic about the Atlantic Charter and coldly ignore national desires and sacred emotions naturally have this kind of argument. However, I think that might shock them.</p>
<p>I said that not long ago, anti-Axis propagandists never talked about the Free Indian National Army. This is not entirely true, because there are two bases. The first basis is what the Washington Evening Star said in its editorial on March 25: "Speaking of Burma, there is one phenomenon that we find particularly painful, and that is that the Indian National Army is participating in the Japanese army. Indeed, as long as the Indian army enters Indian territory, it may arouse radical Indian independence elements to rise up."</p>
<p>The second basis is what the American "Afternoon Paper" said in its editorial on April 11: "Chandra Bose's entry into Indian territory will have serious consequences for the Indian independence movement. The British must immediately release Nehru and prepare to deal with several emerging situations."</p>
<p>These observations are almost correct. To some extent, I highly agree with the arguments of these newspapers, because their regarding the historical fact of the Indian army's entry into Indian territory is a matter of "common sense." If so, then is the concealment of this fact by London and Chongqing a lack of common sense, or is there another purpose? Undoubtedly, it must be the latter. So what is their purpose? The purpose of London and New Delhi is very obvious, because they know that no matter how the Indians are whipped by them, as long as the Indian National Army enters India to a certain extent, it will definitely affect the morale and spirit of the Indian masses and rise up against the British. This is extremely natural.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Attitude</p>
<p>Let's focus on Chongqing's attitude. Before discussing the details, let's quote an ancient Chinese poem: "Burning beanstalks to cook beans, the beans cry in the pot, born from the same root, why are you so eager to harm each other?" How does Chiang Kai-shek feel when he hears this? He calls himself the successor of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, propagating Pan-Asianism. He is also the one who expounded the concept of Asian consciousness in the book "China's Destiny." Chiang Kai-shek's answer to this question is not only to cooperate with the British and Americans and build the Ledo Road to prevent Indians from establishing India, not only to massacre the people of Burma and trample on Burmese territory, at least Burma has obtained national dignity and independence; but also to participate in the Allied forces and fight against the Indian National Army.</p>
<p>In the book "China's Destiny," Chiang Kai-shek said: "China's liberation is based on a stable and independent national sentiment." Indeed, this is correct. But on the other hand, how can Chiang Kai-shek, who so sacredly and firmly adheres to national sentiment, explain what he has already done and is doing in India and Burma? Here I discover the reason why Chongqing never talks about the Indian National Army.</p>
<p>Finally, our conclusion is: there is no reason for Chongqing not to recognize the national liberation engaged in by the Indian National Army. Similarly, a deep and significant feeling is also being created in Chongqing's celebration camp to consider the policy of continuing the war of resistance.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Lights Must Not Leak Outward <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>In the past few days, we have often received letters from readers reporting that the city's blackout regulations are gradually being relaxed. Between 8:00 and 9:00 PM, lights leaking outward from tall buildings are a common sight. For example, many windows in the Dagong Building on Guilin Road are leaking light, indicating a clear lack of attention to shielding.</p>
<p>We have already discussed twice that we should pay attention to long-term compliance with the implementation of long-term air defense and should never be inconsistent or gradually reduce it to a mere formality. Now, based on readers' reports, we will further express our humble opinion as follows:</p>
<p>On the one hand, we hope that citizens will understand the meaning of wartime air defense, develop the habit of remaining calm in emergencies to protect their safety, and earnestly comply with all air defense regulations, especially the shielding of lights. On the other hand, we hope that the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will pay attention to the implementation of air defense regulations at all times and that personnel in the baojia system will persuade and correct windows that are leaking light, so that residents develop the habit of compliance. If those who do not comply with the rules are not corrected in a timely manner, they will become lazy over time, and the air defense regulations will become mere formalities, and the meaning of air defense will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>As for the use of street lights, they should be adapted to the actual needs, with standard brightness and standard shielding methods, and should be widely installed to prevent petty theft.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Japanese Army Press Department Analyzes the Situation in Burma, Emphasizing the Significant Meaning of the Indian Offensive <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (12th), at a meeting with Chinese journalists in Shanghai organized by the Army Press Department of the Allied nations, Mr. Akahoshi, on request, provided a very detailed analysis of the recent situation in Burma. The substance of his discussion is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Chongqing side's policy is "War of Resistance Against Japan," using the war to strive for liberation. This is their goal. However, the Axis powers are fighting for the liberation of the entire East Asia. After the liberation of East Asia, China will naturally be resolved. This offensive against India is a step in the liberation war of East Asia, so its significance in the liberation of the entire East Asia is extremely significant. Therefore, after the launch of the offensive against India, the impact on the Allied side, especially the British, American, and Chongqing sides, is extremely significant. Since the launch of the war against India, it has proceeded very smoothly, and the military base in A-mi Province, which is also a transportation hub, has been occupied. Furthermore, the capture of Imphal is just around the corner, causing great panic among the British, American, and Chongqing sides.</p>
<p>Indian Offensive Divided into Five Theaters</p>
<p>As for the development of the Indian offensive, it is described below in five areas.</p>
<p>"First Area" is in the Arakan region, where fierce battles have been fought with the British 7th and 5th Divisions. The British 7th Division in the Buthidaung area has been annihilated, so the fighting in this area can be temporarily concluded. The enemy has vigorously promoted that "they can land from the Bay of Bengal, attempting to recapture Burma," but if the enemy really lands here, it can be said that it is just a repeat of the tragedy.</p>
<p>"Second Area" is in the Kaladan River basin, where the enemy's West African local force, the 11th Division, has also been surrounded and annihilated by our army between Kyauktaw and Kaladan.</p>
<p>"Third Area" is the British Indian Army's 17th Division between Tiddim and Tonzan, which has also been surrounded and annihilated.</p>
<p>"Fourth Area" is slightly north of the third area, which is the Maline and Tadam front, which is the so-called battle in central Burma. Now, this aspect of the battle can be called "the war to invade India," which has a more profound meaning. This aspect of the war is to break through the national border, with Imphal, Kohima, and Dimapur as the target of the offensive. The enemy's forces in the area are the British Indian Army's 20th and 23rd Divisions, as well as the remnants of the troops that were surrounded and annihilated by our army in the Tiddim area.</p>
<p>"Fifth Area" is the Fort Hertz area. This area is the base for Chongqing's counter-offensive against Burma, so the war is particularly fierce. The area has Chongqing's 22nd, 30th, and 38th Divisions, and the two American brigades led by Colonel Merrill. The above is the enemy's counter-offensive before the rainy season (May). However, the battle line is too long, and there is no consistent transportation, so the army's operations are very chaotic. The reason is that the views of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Chongqing are different, so the operations are not unified. In other words, the reason why the operations cannot be unified is that the operational goals of each other are different. In this situation, the enemy will inevitably be defeated.</p>
<p>Imphal Isolated</p>
<p>As for the current situation, due to the above reasons, Imphal, the enemy's base for the counter-offensive against Burma, has become an isolated area, so the Eastern Indian Railway feels a serious threat of being cut off. Although the enemy attempts to cut off the Burma Railway by air transport troops, it is like a moth to a flame, throwing itself into the net. The Japanese army's offensive against Imphal is extremely fierce, and the airfield there cannot be used. Even if the enemy has such actions, it will be trapped in a dead end. Judging from the war situation in the above-mentioned fifth area, we can know that the most intense counter-offensive by the enemy is in the Fort Hertz area. Although the armies and American forces in the Fort Hertz area have tried their best to revitalize and acted several times, they were forced to be restrained by the fierce Japanese army's offensive against Imphal, and ultimately failed. The London Manchester Report commented on the situation in Burma in an editorial on April 8: "The line from the A-teng-mi Railway through Kohima to Imphal has unfortunately been cut off by the Japanese army in two places, and the Japanese army has advanced to the western area only forty miles away from this railway. If this railway is cut off by the Japanese army, not only will Stilwell's troops fighting in the Fort Hertz valley be trapped in a desperate situation, but also the construction of the Ledo Road will not be able to continue due to the lack of supply of materials," and so on.</p>
<p>Chongqing Side Causes Major Repercussions</p>
<p>In this situation, the Chongqing side has already caused a major repercussions. It is reported that the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published on April 5: "The British army fighting in Burma has no actions worthy of our attention. The British army responsible for operations in Southeast Asia should make actions beyond the current actions based on their progress," and so on. At the same time, the Chongqing Communist Party's organ newspaper, the "Xinhua Daily," also issued extremely dissatisfied remarks on the same day, saying that the armies in western Yunnan, watching this situation, why are they still standing still? The war situation in Imphal is as described above, and its importance is further analyzed. On March 24, the Southeast Asia Joint Command announced: "Anyone who can secure Imphal will threaten the transportation of Stilwell's troops attacking Fort Hertz. Under the joint offensive of the Japanese and Indian armies, the operation against India is very important, so it is no problem for the Japanese army to occupy Imphal. If the area falls, the British, American, and Chongqing attempts to recapture Burma will be in vain, and the British and Americans will not be able to make any further actions against Burma. As for reopening the Burma Road, it will be hopeless, needless to say. What the Chongqing side is currently concerned about is to use the counter-offensive against Burma to reopen the Burma Road in order to receive foreign assistance. The American side intends to use this to reopen the Burma Road so that it can send American troops to strengthen its forces in order to fulfill its ambition to attack Japan through the Chinese mainland. The reason why the British side is trying to win the war is to try to re-oppress India. Now, in this war situation, the goals of the enemy's British, American, and Chongqing sides are all focused on Burma. However, as a result of the fierce Japanese offensive, the three sides have been dealt a major blow. Secondly, the Burma-India war has a political significance, that is, the Indian army has shown its ability to support its government and establish a strong independent government.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Are We Having a General Mobilization for Increased Production? <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The first sentence of President Wang's New Year's Day address this year was, "This year should be a year of general mobilization for the increased production movement." Time flies, and one-third of the so-called year of increased production has already passed. If we ask whether the increased production movement has implemented a general mobilization, then the few sentences that the President has said are enough to make us all reflect on ourselves! He said: "Excess idle capital should be used for increased production, unproductive labor should be used for increased production, spare time should be used for increased production, excessive enjoyment and unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible and used for increased production, and daily necessities and surplus waste from agriculture, industry, and commerce should also be collected and used for increased production."</p>
<p>Everyone should feel that the few sentences quoted above are still ringing in our ears, but the facts that tell us are just as described in the previous newspaper's short commentary, which is clearly in a contradictory position with what the President instructed and expected. Therefore, we hope that entrepreneurs will unanimously transfer a part of their strength to the establishment of handicrafts. Its subjective effect lies in using excess idle capital, unproductive labor, spare time, and unnecessary consumption, so that they will no longer become worms of corruption. But its objective effect is to promote the production of various departments necessary for the people's daily use, so that they can be self-sufficient. As far as we know, handicrafts have occupied an important position in Guangdong in recent years: since the establishment of various handicraft factories in 1942, handicrafts have been divided into weaving, machine weaving, chemical crafts, and bamboo and wood crafts, and their main production is cotton cloth and towels, and they are actively increasing production every day. This is exactly what we in Central China should learn from. Therefore, if the increased production movement is not yet a general mobilization, please start with the establishment of handicrafts as soon as possible, in addition to increased agricultural production!</p>

<h3 id="e42">Exchange Supervisory Committee Held 10th Standing Committee Meeting <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Approved Seven New Stocks for Listing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Exchange Supervisory Committee held its tenth standing committee meeting the other day. All the members, including Chairman Chen, attended the meeting. The committee approved the listing of seven new stocks, discussed several important cases. Moreover, the committee noted that the recent sharp drop in stock prices and rumors from the outside that the exchange had sold off stocks that had not been transferred and issued temporary receipts for circulation in the market, which led to the sharp drop in stock prices due to the increase in stock chips. In order to clarify the truth, it has sent the head of the audit team to the site for investigation. It is estimated that the total number of company stocks transferred by the exchange before and after is 109, with a total of 11,657,756 shares, and 30,737 temporary receipts were issued. As of March 31, 25,771 of these temporary receipts had been recovered and exchanged for the company's stock certificates, totaling 10,127,202 shares, and there were still 4,966 temporary receipts that had not been recovered, totaling 1,530,554 shares. Among these shares, 100,425 shares are being transferred, 2,200 shares were printed incorrectly, and 8,874 shares are temporarily suspended from transfer. As for the 1,418,455 shares that have been exchanged for stock certificates but have not been exchanged by the holder of the temporary receipts, they are all stored in the exchange for temporary receipt redemption at any time. After a random inspection of several companies, the numbers were all accurate, and there was no case of private use. The exchange has also announced a deadline for the redemption of temporary receipts, and it will no longer handle the division and transfer of accounts from April.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Preventing Hoarding Ban on Transfer of Goods No Delay in Futures <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The authorities have recently been paying close attention to the daily transactions of merchants in various industries. No matter what kind of goods, once the guest sells to the firm, the firm must immediately sell the goods to the store that operates these goods, and then the store displays them in the store for legitimate users to choose from, and it is strictly forbidden to transfer and sell them. If the firm trades with the firm, or the store buys and sells with the store, there are many malpractices due to the transfer of sales, which easily leads to hoarding and speculation, manipulation and monopoly, and other bad phenomena. At the same time, mutual profits invisibly increase the seller's costs and raise market prices. Therefore, in order to completely eliminate these illegal transactions, for all firms, stores, and guests, when goods are sold or purchased, the buying and selling parties must issue a transaction slip when the price is agreed and the transaction is officially concluded. The names of the seller and buyer's stores, the name of the goods, the quantity, the price, the date, and the signature and seal of the resident agent should be stated on the slip. Each party should keep one slip, and another slip should be sent to the market management committee or the industry association for inspection at any time. However, when the buyer purchases these goods, it must hire a car to pick up the goods from the warehouse or pier within the prescribed time limit, and must not deliberately delay. Once overdue, the firm may freely sell the goods to other parties, and the original buyer shall not stop it, but the payment may be given as appropriate to avoid disputes.</p>

<h3 id="e46">A Glimpse of the Nursery of the Women's Christian Association <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>With a cheerful mood, I walked on Dashilu Yi Dingpan Road, looking up and counting the house numbers, "No. 66," ah, here it is! Walking into the iron gate, a tall Western-style house stood facing me, quite magnificent in appearance. A circle of bamboo fence was erected near the steps, and the courtyard was quiet and silent. I went around from the side door, and a nurse in white invited me into the office. The director of the nursery, a very young lady - Zhu Peien, but from her conversation and attitude, one could see her competence and ability. I inspected the whole room, which was a very spacious office. Many framed charts and lists were hung on the walls, which were enough to explain everything about the nursery's structure, organization, work situation, and service achievements. There were also many photos of children reading, playing, extracurricular activities, and health check-ups, which decorated the room, seeming to have both a scientific layout and an artistic flavor!</p>
<p>Inside Information</p>
<p>The nursery accommodates a total of 100 children, 59 boys and 41 girls. The procedures for admission require a health check-up, an intelligence test, and a recommender and a guarantor to be qualified. The nursery has two teachers, three nannies, seventeen staff members, and seven workers. The principles are to strive for popularization, scientificization, education, and familialization. It is said that the children in the nursery wash their hands and faces by themselves and eat and dress by themselves. Children aged four or five can develop good habits of self-help and responsibility from an early age, and because it is a collective life, it is also easy to develop a spirit and attitude of mutual assistance and cooperation. The nursery also pays attention to the health of the children, with adequate nutrition, fresh air and sunshine, and sufficient sleep. As for the planning of funds, it can be divided into fundraising and subscription. The former refers to the collection organized by the Women's Christian Association, and the latter can be done by all readers. As long as they are interested in the nursery movement and willing to subscribe, they can donate 100 yuan per month for each child's food expenses, or 1,200 yuan per year. The nursery also has an honorary memorial method for donors. (Here, the writer would like to ask for help on their behalf, hoping that enthusiastic people can provide more assistance.)</p>
<p>Various Features</p>
<p>After inquiring in detail about everything in the nursery, Ms. Zhu accompanied me to visit various places. Climbing the stairs, first there was the "bedroom" (it is said that there are eight rooms in the nursery, three game rooms, one washroom, one convalescent room, two isolation rooms, and one kitchen, which is not a small scale). Opening the door of a bedroom, the sunlight shone on the small iron beds, with neat rows, white sheets, and a soft and quiet atmosphere, which made people feel like they were in a hospital. Most of the small iron beds are for single people, and there are also larger and shorter beds for two younger children to climb up and sleep together. There are also several bed frames with a square bronze plaque engraved with the name of the donor in memory. After seeing it, it gave me an impression of "neatness and simplicity." Then I went to the "washroom," where rows of wooden racks were placed with numbered washbasins and mouthwash jars, and the hand towels were hung on hooks. It is said that the female workers have to wash them with sand soap every evening. There is also a feature here, that is, more than a dozen nurses all wear white clothes, which has a hospital atmosphere.</p>
<p>Walking into the "convalescent room," the sunlight was very sufficient, and the air was also very fresh. It is said that this room is for children to rest and live in after they are sick. I went to visit the "isolation room," where several children suffering from infectious diseases were lying quietly on the beds. Some nurses were bandaging children with skin diseases. I heard that children in various nurseries have been suffering from this kind of epidemic recently, which is called Munips in English and mumps in Chinese, and is called "pig腮肿" in the local dialect. It is very serious among children. It is said that if boys suffer too much, it will affect their future fertility, so the severity of the disease can be known.</p>
<p>I also visited the "game room." The car was broken and placed high on the top of the tree, and the steering wheel of the foot-powered car was also dropped and needed to be repaired. The rest are some very simple toys. Here, I also ask on their behalf that all sectors donate some old and tired toys that children play with, but are enough to inspire children's intelligence, such as building blocks, chess, balls, and other toys to benefit the nursery.</p>
<p>Farewell Message</p>
<p>Finally, when I left, I expressed my admiration to Ms. Zhu for their service enthusiasm and hard-working spirit, but she smiled and replied, "... Our spiritual rewards are very great!" Indeed, to serve children, first, you must be interested, and second, you must be patient. You must have love and enthusiasm. Only by possessing these conditions can you be worthy of being a kind mother to children!</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Shark (1)</p>
<p>There is about half a month between entering the port and departing for a voyage. The local newspaper published an announcement: "Temporarily suspending publication during the mooring period in the home port, please forgive the readers."</p>
<p>Makoto and others took a freshwater bath in the Yokosuka Suikosha bathhouse, which they had not been able to take for a long time, and then ran to the road to take a few steps, feeling that their steps on the land were very happy. Since landing in Futami, this feeling has occurred, which Makoto finds strange. Makoto suddenly realized that this might be the taste of "home port."</p>
<p>The roads in Yokosuka are slightly narrower than those in Kure and Sasebo, and wherever you go, you feel a pungent smell. He was still thinking in his heart that he would like to visit the Kyoto he had never seen before as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tokyo is where his elder brother Kakuzo lives, somewhere in Koto Ward. Because the place is not easy to find, he will write a letter first.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, on September 15th, all candidate officers above the rank of special warrant officer in the fleet decided to go to Kyoto to receive supreme glory.</p>
<p>When Makoto saw the Double Bridge, he said that he already felt that he was standing in the respectable center of Japan, so his body trembled. After worshiping the forbidden area of ​​the Imperial Palace, he felt that everything had become a dream.</p>
<p>A small candidate officer was able to receive such supreme glory, so Makoto's heart was filled with gratitude and nothing else. This was more than a hundred times the gratitude he had expressed at the Ifuku training ground during his second middle school life. "The people in Tokyo are a bit unkind. There are such restaurants, but everyone pretends not to know..."</p>
<p>Kato said these unfair words while holding a fork.</p>
<p>After Makoto withdrew, wearing his original dress uniform, he visited the Meiji Jingu Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine, and then returned to the ship that day.</p>
<p>On the third day, he took a special electric train from Yokosuka to Kyoto to visit the capital. At the same time, he also arranged to meet Kato, and they went together. He planned to visit Ueno Park first; but when he arrived at Ueno Station, he got lost.</p>
<p>"Then, how do we go?"</p>
<p>"Have you asked?"</p>
<p>"You ask!"</p>
<p>The two pushed each other. Wearing the first type of candidate officer's uniform and asking passers-by on the road was a bit embarrassing. However, the two walked along and unknowingly came to a place similar to a park.</p>
<p>The two carefully visited the museum and immediately felt very hungry, but as naval officers, it was not very elegant to eat and drink in an inappropriate place. Although there were teahouses in the woods of Ueno, there were no restaurants.</p>
<p>The two had no choice but to stop being embarrassed and finally took turns asking where the restaurants were. At this time, a Seiyoken restaurant was found behind them.</p>

<p>At this time of emergency and rising living costs, the impact on family life is both deep and significant. Therefore, many families are willing to sell surplus household items to slightly supplement the family burden, and some families are willing to purchase household items at a lower price to reduce family expenses. The Adult Department of the Women's Christian Association has launched a "Second-Hand Market" to meet this need, which will be held on April 21, 22, 23, and 24, from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day. The types of items consigned include clothing, kitchen utensils, toys, ornaments, cosmetics, daily necessities, and stationery. The market is completely service-oriented and acts in accordance with the regulations, only taking 10% as all expenses.</p>

<p>After liquidating his family property, the entrepreneur Chen Maoji felt sorry for the difficulty of maintaining the children's institutions introduced by the newspaper.
