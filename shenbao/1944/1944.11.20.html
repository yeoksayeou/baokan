<h3>雷伊泰北部日軍　展開熾烈殲滅戰　日空軍迭襲敵艦船團及機塲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十九日中央社電　北部雷伊泰敵軍，謀由卡里加拉經比那莫波安，强行進攻奧爾莫克，然已爲日軍切斷退路，敵軍第二十四師先鋒部隊陷於孤立潰滅之境地，因而兩軍之作戰，一變攻防而爲日軍力謀切斷敵軍退路之勢。日軍繼續於十五日向瑪那嘎斯納斯方面之敵軍冒雨進攻，展開白刃戰，將敵軍向海面壓迫，終於進至可以俯瞰敵陣之高地，故刻下該方面之殲滅戰正行熾烈。該方面日軍常立於最前綫，激勵將兵，其殲敵之意氣至爲旺盛，敵軍深感狼狽，乃在里加拉公路以戰車當光，展開突擊，但由於日軍之肉搏攻擊。結果慘然敗退。又達卡密地區日軍確保西方高地，不斷對敵軍加以熾烈砲擊，續向前進。十五日薄暮反覆以獨特之突入戰術，予敵軍莫大損害，士氣愈見旺盛。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地十九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊十八日上午攻擊集結於雷伊泰灣之敵運輸船團，將其大型運輸船二艘炸沉，二艘炸毀起火。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地十九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊在白晝攻擊雷伊泰變內敵艦船，除將其華盛頓型戰艦一艘擊沉起火外，更由掃射敵驅逐艦一艘使之起火。十七日傍晚更於雷伊泰島塔克羅班海面強襲敵運輸船圑，作猛烈攻擊，但其戰果刻尚不詳。</p>
<p>菲島前綫日軍某基地十九日中央社電　航空部隊十七日大舉轟炸塔拉克敵機塲，予該機塲南方地區以重創。十八日拂曉日俯衝轟炸機隊，更急發塔克羅班敵機塲，冒熾烈之敵高射砲火，作勇敢之俯衝轟炸，使敵彈藥燃料貯藏所，及其他設施三處起火焚燒。該批日機歸遼後，繼之日戰鬥機隊更强襲敵機塲，與前來應戰之敵P38型機十餘架，展開熾烈之空戰，敵機被擊落一架，擊毀二架後，日機更排除敵機羣，繼續猛炸敵陸上設施，使其設施一處發火焚燒，其他各設施亦蒙相當損害，日機安然飛返。</p>
<h3>菲島戰局觀察</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日美兩軍前正於菲律賓展開空前激烈之陸海空軍戰鬥，敵美現持有之戰力，已達空前多量，日軍現亦舉全力於新呼應，不容許敵人進犯菲律賓之決意上而實行邀擊，或出動陸海特攻隊，此實爲太平洋上之一大決戰，茲分海陸空三方面說明如次：</p>
<p>敵軍兵力七個師</p>
<p>（一）「陸戰」敵美圖作戰術上之奇襲，選定雷伊泰島爲登陸地點，雖以甚大之犧牲，獲得數飛行基地，然以日空軍部隊之猛威，仍未得充分發揮其能力，雷伊泰方面日守軍現仍確實把握作戰據點，着着準備攻擊。又雷伊泰島西方高地日守軍，殺傷敵人達四千五百餘名，完成警戒任務，一面牽制敵人行動，一面準備正式反攻，故決定雷伊泰鳥運命之決戰期，已刻刻迫近。本月七日奧爾莫克公路北段，日美兩軍先鋒展開遭遇戰，是即此次大戰序幕，近十日來因兩方援軍之加入作戰，故戰鬥愈爲激烈。敵美於雷伊泰島登陸之初，預定僅爲五師團，其後自十二日以後，復又增加二個師團，此足證敵對於日軍之强力反攻，已感不安，並圖在日軍未充分增强反擊力時決定戰局。</p>
<p>日特攻隊發揮威力</p>
<p>（二）「空戰」菲律賓海戰以來，敵美曾以相當强力之機動部隊，於十月末及本月五·六·十三·十四日相繼襲擊呂宋島，每次皆因日軍特攻隊及空軍之反擊，徒增加其損害而已，故敵美現對使用機動部隊，已非常愼重。目下兩軍空戰已移入基地空軍之格鬥，日空軍現正續行猛炸敵佔領下之飛機場，壓縮敵基地能力，同時更長驅空襲敵空軍據點摩羅泰。西新幾內亞等地·及敵補給基地。阿特米拉齊敵亦連日猛炸日軍西南太平洋基地，戰况空前激烈。</p>
<p>敵方補給極感困難</p>
<p>（三）「海戰」敵美艦船部隊目下依然盤據於雷伊泰灣內，且連日正以相當多數之運輸船圑，往復前後方基地，蓋以七師圑之大軍，補給必須十萬噸以上，更以戰鬥激烈，其需要自必更爲增大，颶風期一到，敵之運輸亦必更行困難，故擊滅憑恃物量之敵美捷徑，自以遮斷運輸路爲第一，日軍之攻擊重點，現即置重於此，故結局補給問題仍須歸入海上制權問題。然欲擊滅此等敵艦船羣，唯有發揮空軍力，菲律賓作戰與旣往各島嶼作戰性格，完全異趣。今戰塲南北縱長的一千五百公里，東西橫寬的四百公里，正如山下將軍所謂之「廣大戰塲」，故如無顧著兵力，極難在此獲得效果。敵現正動員所有海空軍及陸上部隊，甚至澳洲軍隊，總之，敵傾注全力於太平洋全戰塲，實屬必然之歸趨。</p>
<h3>緬甸戰況</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　敵軍在北緬及緬甸中部國境之行動，已逐漸活躍，日部隊在此刻正採取萬全之配置着着强化，對敵邀換陣地。至於孟加拉灣方面，敵艦艇之動向亦逐漸活躍，實有施行警戒之必要。</p>
<h3>美潛艇　被擊沉四艘</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　美潛艇十七日被日軍擊沉二艘後，二十八日復於日本近海被日驅潛部隊擊沉四艘，其中一艘竟爲九十噸級日軍哨戒艇之機雷擊沉，該哨戒艇於受敵潛艇海上接近攻擊時，因所載砲火不堪使用，不得已而將所載機雷全部投下，敵潛艇觸此機雷後，尾部聳起當即沉沒。</p>
<h3>巴莫在日演講　確信必獲勝昨</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大政翼贊會　亞本部及翼贊壯年團主　之緬甸國家代表巴莫氏大演說會，十八日下午一時三十分個此間日比谷公會堂舉行，聽衆極踴躍，巴莫氏演辭要旨如次決定此次戰爭最後勝利者，乃爲精神力，最近兩三世紀爲牧資文明之時代，盎格魯撒克遜民族即爲僅知物資之民族，目下彼等舉物資文明之絕滅時期菜經到來，久受彼等壓　之東亞各民族，不得不以偉大之精神力猛烈奮起。本人對完成吾人戰鬥目的，具有三種堅定信念，第一，即過去之戰爭，爲軍隊對軍隊之戰爭，而現在之戰爭則爲民族對民族之戰爭。第二，爲大東亞共同宣言，已使大東亞宣言內容逐步實現，即完成大東亞戰爭之唯一途徑。第三，爲　驚世界之神風特別攻擊隊精神，大東亞民族具有此種爲建設大東亞不惜生命之精神，大東亞戰爭必獲勝利，吾人唯有作戰到底。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>平抑物價</h3>
<p>目前我國民生問題極見嚴重，亟應妥善解救，民生問題的　結，其最直接所表現出來的，是高物價，但所謂物價問題，實錯綜椱雜地包含着多方面的事情，現時所行的若干對策，不僅犯着頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚的毛病，有的甚至會顚倒實情，做出頭痛去醫脚，而脚痛却去醫頭的現象，速治標也談不到，更那裏談得上正本淸源！</p>
<p>我們認爲要解救目前以高物價爲中心的民生問題，應就政治·財政·經濟等各方面都同時配合起來，去淸除足以紊亂經濟，刺激物價，影響民生的事情，單單個別的對策是不够的</p>
<p>在政治方面，目前國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒氏所提示的「行政力的澈底」，確是十分重要。但我們認爲欲求行政力的澈低，本報幾次所提出過的革新政治，改善行政機構，健全人事，澄淸吏治，建立專家政治，仍是先決條件，政冶如不上軌道，任何對策，都是不容易做好。又地方行政的獨善獨是，也足以影響行政力的澈底，因爲獨善獨是所產生的所謂地方勢力，有時往往會阻碍國家施策的推行，譬如各地各以自己的單位管理物資的輸出人，對於過境物資的留難和需索，即爲戕害生產，阻碍物資交流，增高物價的要因之一。政治與經濟息息相關，祗有在健全的政治基礎之上，才有安定的經濟。再如附帶於政治的治安，對安定經濟也極其重要，這有待於中日常局的協力。</p>
<p>關於財政金融，除整理金融事業，遏止投機，納資金於正軌外，財政上緊縮通貨，整頓租稅的重要性，也已爲我們再三提出過。最近有將儲備券票額增高的現象，不管實際所需要的通貨量該怎樣增多，發行單位一大，發行數量一多，終是刺激物價的巨大動力。</p>
<p>至於租稅，地方上苛捐雜稅以及特殊勢力的不法徵收，常局務必要有快刀斬亂蔴的手段，予以剷除；關係民生很巨的日用品一類的統稅營業稅等，似應設法減低，至少不要再增。畸形娛樂事業（如舞塲·書寓·博彩等）及奢侈品，則應再加重其稅率，這是可以一舉而三得的：即（一）彌補民生有關物品稅收的不足，（二）減少物資不正當的浪費，（三）紏正社會奢靡習氣。對於財產及巨額利得的徵稅，也不妨加以適當的提高，因爲擁有大資產者及收益特多者理宜多盡些力量貢獻於國家，平時已應如此，何况戰時。</p>
<p>以上就政治財政方面安定經濟，平抑物價之道，至經濟方面，木身自然也要施行種種有效的對策，容待日後再論之。</p>

<h3>與曹汝霖　爐邊對談（一）</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>在華北今日最負人望的政治家，恐怕無出於我國的一位老外交家曹汝霖之名。如果你和每一位盟邦的知識階層談到華北政局，沒有一個不會使你注意到會氏的身上。曹氏今日在華北的地位，就和南方的顏駿人先生一樣，是被目爲未來的領導人物。因此，記者於今日和竹田報道部長討論思想問題之後，下午就趕快　車到東城貢院西街四號去拜訪這一位未來的理想政治人物。</p>
<p>提到曹氏，使我想到十年以前，當記者到東京去的時候，有一天在神田正雄先生家裏，我就於他的書齋內看到有曹氏親筆所寫的墨實。那時我就想到曹氏一定對日本的知識階層是極有好感的。再往後想，當記者在上海聖的翰大學附中讀書的時候，曹氏的一位公十呌曹樸的，還是我的同班學友，後來他沒有證畢中學就到日本仕官學校去了。眞想不到在十九年之後，今天記者竟有和曹氏見面的機緣。</p>
<p>白髪爐光相映成趣</p>
<p>曹氏現在雖然以息影之身爲在野的名流，可也並不曾和社會完全隔絕，他還担任着井陘煤礦公司的總裁。他所居的一座平屋洋房，雖不十分大，却是含有幽雅的風緻。只要你一足踏進他的家們，你便可知道這位老外交家是很會頤義的。當記者脫了大衣走進室內，一位白了頭髮的慈祥老人已迎接出來，這便是我懸想了多年的曹汝霖先生。記者當即說明奉了本報陳社長之命北來，因爲仰慕已久特來致敬並代爲致候。曹氏很謙遜地囑爲代謝，於是招待我坐在火爐旁邊，爐中熊熊火光，照射着老人白頭，分外感到一種世紀幽邃之感。我到北京以後，這一次和曹氏爐邊的談話，，可說是頂長的一次，他精神矍鑠，在兩小時長談中，絲毫沒有倦容。我們須知，他已經是七十歲高齡的人了，但他的生命力却比了王叔魯先生恐怕還要親強哩！</p>
<p>起初我們的談鋒只對上海的新聞界近況集中，因爲曹氏聽說李贊候先生出任新聞報社長，且做了全國新聞協會的會長，所以很表興趣。對於本報，他也很關心，我們且遷談到過去史量才先生的故事。後來記者就把談話的課題，漸漸轉到曹氏身上。我問他，聽說盟邦方面很希望他能够再爲祖國復興而挺身，但他反而問記者道：「你在上海的時候，也曾和顏駿人先生討論過這個問題嗎？一顯然他是很主意着顏先生的動靜。</p>
<p>回首前塵概漢無窮</p>
<p>於是話題漸入中日問題，曹氏慨然而嘆，他說：「一切不幸事件都是因爲我國外交當局昏憒，往往把一件極小的可以解決的問題，造成了燎原之巨禍！」關於這一點，他曾向記者指出數件事來：（一）上次歐戰日本參戰後，爲了進攻靑島想在龍口附近登陸襲擊德軍後路，向我國請求假道，我國拒絕於是日軍始强行登陸，且沿途因爲居民大都不肯出售食糧，乃發生了許多的誤會，而引起兩國的不睦。（二）就是萬寳山事件，當初也是很簡單的，因爲韓人所借水田的引水不便，請求擴充租田不准，再請求闢一通水道又不准，乃激起了不幸的爭執，而一連造成了今日的巨禍！</p>
<p>對於過去的外交經過，曹氏娓娓而談，使記者甚感興趣。記者便說：「關於民國初年的外交，我們只讀及書報的記載，於今思來容或有誤解之處。即對閣下而言，一般記載也不無誤解，不知能否今天略加談論？」曹氏就說：「我所有材料，有一部見於王芸生所著：六十年來之中國與日本，有一部分亦已燬盡，所以只得根據此時的記憶說個大槪吧！」說到這裏，僕歐拿上牛奶咖啡和西點來，我們就一面喝咖啡一面談着。曹氏所說的要點有二部，其一是二十一條問題，其二是西原借款問題。（未完）</p>

<h3>中國美術館特輯　中國美術館緣起</h3>
<p>我國夙號文物之邦，歷代所遺，匪特足供吾人稽考先民製作之原，抑亦可覘文化演進之迹，實爲民族精神之所寄，而藝事之精美，在世界藝術史上，尤佔重要之地位，故東西各國，莫不有規模宏大之古物陳列館，不僅保存其國內歷世相傳之文物，藉以發揚其文化與藝術，抑且對於我國古代文物，尤不惜巨資，競相搜求，以供出摩，而資研究，並出版聞書，以廣傳佈，何其盛耶。返觀我國，則雖爲富有文化藝術之古國，並承受先民豐富有文化藝術之古物之研究工作，轉付闕如，以高致歷代相遺之可貴文物，非流入異邦，即錮閉於藏家之手，公衆不易一見，阻礙文化藝術之發揚與進展莫此爲甚。同人等有鑒於此，爰特籌設中國美術館，介紹爲各大收藏家，出其珍藏，公開展覽，上自三代金石，下迄明淸古瓷，別其眞贗，考其源流內衣　時代先生，作有系統之陳列，旣供欣賞，復資研究，保存國寶，公諸同好，其於我國文化藝術之推進，諒不無裨益，邦人君子，盍興乎來。</p>
<h3>美術館之重要</h3>
<p>— 趙叔孺</p>
<p>服飾欲其美，宮室欲其美，愛美固爲人之天性，而研究美術，亦正所以適乎人之天性也。</p>
<p>美術之範圍亦廣矣，凡一切文物，無論其年代之遠近，性質之如何，茍有美術表現於其上者，固無不可以美術品視之，而供吾人之人，近令世界文明各國，莫不有規模宏大之美術館，對於流傳於宇宙間之文物，近取諸已，遠取諸人，無不兼收並蓄，綱羅無遺，蓋所以備國民之觀摩與研究，其關係之重要，有可得而述者，約有下列數端：</p>
<p>（一）每一國家，其先代遺留之文物，實爲其民族精神之所寄，得美術館而保存之，則民衆目之所接，必汕然而起其愛國之心。</p>
<p>（二）先代之的，遠者可以考先民製作之原，近者可覘文化演進之迹，美術館者，綜合古今藝術文化之遺物，將期隨時代而演進之眞實史蹟，作有系統之介紹，使覽者一目瞭然，由茲而鑒往策來，則一切藝術文化之進展，胥將以此爲推動力。</p>
<p>（三）方今爲商戰時代，一切工商實業，無不力求出品之精神美，以爭取市場，美術館者，提供寶貴之資料，予有關方面公開研究之機會，俾得捨已之短，取人之長，並可觸發期靈機而別抒意匠，使其出品有日新月異之進展，以博取廣大之市場，而致國力於充沛，民生於富厚。</p>
<p>（四）吾人研究美術，則心靈浸淫於美感之中，久而改變其氣質，移易性情，於不知不覺之間，故美術館者，實堪謂提倡美育之社會導師，化育國民之美德，而蔚成美善之風俗。</p>
<p>以上僅就其恭　大者而言，其關係之重要有如此者。此外都市人民，以閒餘之時光，作流連之欣賞，旣可替代一切不正當之娛樂，復可涵養心靈，調劑其精神上之疲乏，而忘其一日工作之幸勞。怡情悅性，身心交泰，獲益尤非淺鮮。</p>
<p>所可嘅者，我國以世界富有藝術文化之古國，承受先代豐富之遺物，而號稱大上海之都市，獨美術館付闕如，不可謂非一憾事，此余於諸君子之發志中國美術館，所以深爲快慰，而當茲成立伊始，更不能不寄與無限之希望，以期其由茁芽而滋長，發爲他日奇異之葩，使我國美育獲其偉大之果，與國運同其昌隆也。</p>

<h3>宋五大名槪略</h3>
<p>— 黃肇平</p>
<p>我國瓷器，工藝精美，馳譽世界。宋代定·鈞·汝·官·哥五大名窰所製者·尤爲所著稱·惟此五大名窰·俗有以柴·汝·官·哥·定當之者·考柴窰在河南鄭州，始建於五代卂顯德間，此以周世宗本性柴，故名，瓷皆進御，當時僅名御窰，人宋始專以些窰名之。相傳世宗飭造御瓷，所司請示其色，御秕曰：「兩過天靑震破處，這般顏色作將來。」後遂名其色曰：雨過天靑，其瓷釉明如鏡，質薄如紙，聲淸如穀，紋細如絲，其形制之精，雖爲自古　窰之冠，然以後周之窰何能與乎宋代之列，自當以定·鈞·汝·官·哥爲愜當·用請一述此有宋五大名窰之槪略，藉正俗稱之謬誤。</p>
<p>定窰建於宋初，在今河北定縣，所製胎質細膩，大抵以色白而滋澗者爲貴，質罐而色黃者爲遜，外有淚痕者者眞，劃花者最佳，素者繍花印花者次之，其泑色初皆瑩白，後則踵乎增華，乃有靑花紅紫色及黑色等，因之色紫者又曰紫定，色黑如澿者日黑定，又宋初於定州所造者，日北定，南渡後在景德鎭所製者日南定，此以器仿北定而以南別之，非以地稱也。南定之釉如粉，故又通稱曰粉定。</p>
<p>鈞窰亦建於宋初，在今河南禹縣，其地有鈞臺，因名鈞窰，所製胎質有白灰紅黃諸種，以白者爲上，器備衆色，而其初原爲大靑，惟以色重而近藍，後人逐名之曰天藍。又以靑料中含有銅質，煆煉而變綠或紅紫，於是又起窰變之名，後復利用銅質而製紅紫器，此則更利用其變而演進矣。博物要覽有硃砂紅，蔥翠靑，紅如燕支，靑若蔥翠，紫若墨黑，三者色純無少變露者皆爲上品。</p>
<p>汝窰建於宋嚴宗大觀元年，在今河南臨汝縣，此窰本異靑器，胎質淺黃，細而堅，色有天靑卵靑粉靑等，汁水瑩厚如堆旨，隱有　爪紋底有芝麻花細小掙釘，乃眞物也。</p>
<p>官窰建於宋大觀間，在今河南開封縣，所製胎質有白灰紅之分，陶錬極精純，白者多用含有鐵質之黑泑護胎足，亦有純用鐵骨泥者，色有天靑翠靑粉靑月下白大綠等之別</p>
<p>哥窰係宋處州人章生一之窰，生一有弟日生二，在浙江龍泉之琉田市分窰製器，故以哥窰弟窰相別·哥窰所製胎質之隱紋如魚子，多斷紋，色綫白，器色多翠靑粉靑淺靑灰靑。別有米色一種，乃其變例也。</p>

<h3>Fierce Annihilation Battle Unfolds Against Japanese Troops in Northern Leyte; Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Attacks Enemy Fleets and Airfields</h3>
<p>Manila, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Enemy forces in northern Leyte, attempting to advance on Ormoc via Carigara and Pinamopoan, have had their retreat cut off by Japanese troops. The vanguard of the enemy's 24th Division is isolated and collapsing. The battle has thus transformed from a defensive one for the Japanese to one where they are actively attempting to cut off the enemy's retreat. On the 15th, Japanese troops continued their advance on enemy forces in the Managasnag area despite the rain, engaging in bayonet fighting, pushing the enemy towards the sea. They finally advanced to high ground overlooking the enemy's positions, and the annihilation battle in that area is currently raging fiercely. Japanese troops in that area are constantly on the front lines, inspiring their soldiers, and their morale for annihilating the enemy is extremely high. The enemy, feeling deeply distressed, is using tanks as shields on the Rigala Highway to launch attacks, but they are suffering disastrous defeats due to the Japanese troops' hand-to-hand combat. Furthermore, Japanese troops in the Takami area have secured the western highlands, continuously bombarding the enemy with intense artillery fire and continuing their advance. On the evening of the 15th, they repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with unique infiltration tactics, and their morale is constantly rising.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base on the Philippine front, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the morning of the 18th, Japanese air units attacked enemy transport fleets assembled in Leyte Gulf, sinking two large transport ships and destroying two others, which caught fire.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the Philippines, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - During daylight hours, Japanese air units attacked enemy warships in Leyte Gulf, sinking and setting fire to one Washington-class battleship, and setting fire to one enemy destroyer by strafing. On the evening of the 17th, they also launched a fierce attack on enemy transport groups off Tacloban, Leyte Island, but the results of the battle are not yet known.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base on the Philippine front, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 17th, air units carried out a large-scale bombing of the enemy airfield at Tacloc, heavily damaging the southern part of the airfield. At dawn on the 18th, Japanese dive bomber squadrons also launched a rapid attack on the enemy airfield at Tacloban, bravely dive-bombing under intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, setting fire to three enemy ammunition and fuel storage depots and other facilities. After these Japanese aircraft returned to base, Japanese fighter squadrons then strongly attacked the enemy airfield, engaging over ten enemy P-38 aircraft that came to intercept them in a fierce aerial battle. After one enemy aircraft was shot down and two were damaged, the Japanese aircraft overcame the enemy aircraft group and continued to bomb enemy ground facilities heavily, causing one facility to catch fire and other facilities to suffer considerable damage. The Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Philippine Battle Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese and American forces are currently engaged in an unprecedentedly fierce land, sea, and air battle in the Philippines. The enemy Americans currently possess an unprecedented amount of combat power, and the Japanese military is also exerting its full strength in response, determined to prevent the enemy from invading the Philippines by carrying out an ambush or deploying land and sea special attack units. This is truly a major decisive battle in the Pacific. The situation is described below in three aspects: sea, land and air:</p>
<p>Enemy Strength Seven Divisions</p>
<p>(1) "Land Battle" The enemy Americans attempted a tactical surprise attack, selecting Leyte Island as the landing site. Although they acquired several air bases at a great sacrifice, they have not been able to fully utilize their capabilities due to the fierce power of the Japanese air units. The Japanese garrison on Leyte is still firmly holding onto its operational bases, preparing for an attack. Furthermore, the Japanese garrison on the western highlands of Leyte Island has killed or wounded over 4,500 enemy soldiers, completing its guard duty while checking the enemy's movements and preparing for a formal counterattack. Therefore, the decisive period for determining the fate of Leyte Island is approaching rapidly. On the 7th of this month, the vanguards of the Japanese and American forces engaged in an encounter battle on the northern section of the Ormoc Highway, which was the prelude to this great battle. In the past ten days, the battle has become increasingly fierce due to the involvement of reinforcements from both sides. At the beginning of the enemy American landing on Leyte Island, it was planned for only five divisions, but since the 12th, two more divisions have been added. This proves that the enemy is feeling uneasy about the strong Japanese counterattack and is attempting to decide the battle before the Japanese military can fully increase its counterattack power.</p>
<p>Japanese Special Attack Units Unleash Their Power</p>
<p>(2) "Air Battle" Since the Philippine Sea Battle, the enemy Americans have repeatedly attacked Luzon Island with considerable mobile force at the end of October and on the 5th, 6th, 13th, and 14th of this month. Each time, due to the counterattack of the Japanese special attack units and air force, they only increased their losses. Therefore, the enemy Americans are now very cautious about using mobile units. At present, the air battle between the two armies has moved into the melee of the air force of the base. The Japanese air force is now continuing to bomb the enemy-occupied airfields, compressing the enemy's base capabilities, and at the same time launching long-range air raids on the enemy's air base at Morotai. The enemy Atmirazi is also fiercely bombing the Japanese Southwest Pacific base for days, and the battle is unprecedentedly fierce.</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Extreme Difficulty in Replenishing Supplies</p>
<p>(3) "Sea Battle" The enemy American fleet is still entrenched in Leyte Gulf and is repeatedly shuttling back and forth to the front and rear bases with a considerable number of transport ships. With an army of seven divisions, the supply must be over 100,000 tons, and the need for combat will inevitably increase, and once the hurricane season arrives, the enemy's transportation will inevitably be more difficult. Therefore, the shortcut to destroying the enemy Americans who rely on material resources is to cut off the transportation route. The focus of the Japanese military's attack is now on this, so the supply problem must still be included in the maritime control issue in the end. However, the only way to destroy these enemy fleets is to exert the power of the air force. The Philippine campaign is completely different in character from the previous island campaigns. The battlefield is 1,500 kilometers long from north to south and 400 kilometers wide from east to west, just as General Yamashita called it a "vast battlefield," so it is extremely difficult to achieve results here without considering the force. The enemy is now mobilizing all its naval, air, and land forces, even Australian troops. In short, the enemy's pouring all its strength into the entire Pacific battlefield is an inevitable trend.</p>
<h3>Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enemy's movements in northern Burma and the border area of central Burma have gradually become active. The Japanese forces here are currently taking full precautions to strengthen their defenses and confront the enemy. As for the Bay of Bengal, the movements of enemy warships are also gradually becoming active, and it is necessary to exercise caution.</p>
<h3>Four American Submarines Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After two American submarines were sunk by the Japanese military on the 17th, four more were sunk by the Japanese anti-submarine units off the coast of Japan on the 28th. One of them was sunk by a mine laid by a 90-ton Japanese patrol boat. When the patrol boat was approached and attacked at sea by the enemy submarine, it was unable to use its onboard artillery and had to drop all of its mines. The enemy submarine struck a mine, and its tail rose up before sinking immediately.</p>
<h3>Ba Maw's Speech in Japan: Confident of Victory Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A large-scale speech meeting by Ba Maw, the Burmese national representative of the Asia Headquarters of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Imperial Rule Young Men's Corps, was held at the Hibiya Public Hall in Tokyo at 1:30 PM on the 18th. The audience was very enthusiastic. The main points of Ba Maw's speech were as follows: The final victor of this war will be the power of the spirit. The last two or three centuries have been an era of material civilization, and the Anglo-Saxon nations are nations that only know material things. Now they are at the point of extinguishing material civilization. The East Asian nations that have long been oppressed by them must rise up fiercely with great spiritual power. I have three firm beliefs in completing our war objectives. First, the wars of the past were wars between armies, while the wars of today are wars between nations. Second, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been making the contents of the Greater East Asia Declaration realize step by step, which is the only way to complete the Greater East Asia War. Third, the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, which is shocking the world. The Greater East Asian nations have the spirit of not hesitating to sacrifice their lives to build Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia War will surely be victorious, and we can only fight to the end.</p>

<h3>Stabilizing Prices</h3>
<p>At present, our people's livelihood problem is extremely serious and urgently needs to be properly resolved. The crux of the livelihood problem is most directly manifested in high prices. However, the so-called price problem actually involves many complex aspects. Some of the current countermeasures not only make the mistake of treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, but some even reverse the reality, treating the foot when the head hurts and treating the head when the foot hurts. Even a quick fix cannot be discussed, let alone getting to the root of the problem!</p>
<p>We believe that in order to solve the current livelihood problem centered on high prices, we should coordinate political, financial, and economic aspects to eliminate things that can disrupt the economy, stimulate prices, and affect people's lives. Individual countermeasures alone are not enough.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the current Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, pointed out that "thorough administrative power" is very important. However, we believe that in order to achieve thorough administrative power, the reforms of politics, improvement of administrative structure, soundness of personnel, clarification of officialdom, and establishment of expert politics that this newspaper has repeatedly proposed are still prerequisites. If politics is not on the right track, any countermeasure will not be easy to do well. Furthermore, the local administration's independent action is sufficient to affect the thorough administrative power, because the so-called local forces generated by independent action will sometimes hinder the implementation of national policies. For example, the difficulty and demand for the passage of materials by various regions and units that manage the output of materials is one of the reasons for damaging production, hindering the exchange of materials, and increasing prices. Politics and economics are closely related, and only on a sound political foundation can there be a stable economy. Furthermore, the security attached to politics is extremely important for stabilizing the economy, which depends on the cooperation of the central and local authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding finance, in addition to reorganizing financial undertakings, curbing speculation, and bringing funds back to the right track, the importance of tightening currency and consolidating taxes in finance has also been repeatedly raised by us. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of reserve notes. Regardless of how much the actual amount of currency needed should be increased, the larger the issuing unit and the larger the number of issues, the greater the impetus to stimulate prices.</p>
<p>As for taxation, the local surcharges and illegal collection of special forces must be eliminated with quick and decisive measures. The consolidated taxes and business taxes on daily necessities related to people's livelihood should be reduced or at least not increased. The tax rate on abnormal entertainment businesses (such as dance halls, brothels, and gambling) and luxury goods should be increased, which can achieve three things at once: (1) make up for the lack of tax revenue on goods related to people's livelihood, (2) reduce undue waste of materials, and (3) correct social extravagance. Taxes on property and huge profits may also be appropriately increased, because those with large assets and high incomes should do their best to contribute to the country, which should be the case at ordinary times, not to mention wartime.</p>
<p>The above are ways to stabilize the economy and stabilize prices from the political and financial aspects. As for the economic aspect, various effective countermeasures must also be implemented. This will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Fireside Chat with Cao Rulin (1)</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>Among the politicians most respected in North China today, perhaps none surpasses the name of Cao Rulin, an old diplomat from our country. If you talk to any member of the Allied intellectual class about the political situation in North China, none will fail to draw your attention to Mr. Cao. Cao's position in North China today is like that of Mr. Yan Junren in the South, and he is seen as a future leader. Therefore, after discussing ideological issues with Minister Takeda today, the reporter quickly took a car to No. 4 Gongyuan West Street, Dongcheng, to visit this ideal political figure of the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr. Cao, I was reminded of ten years ago, when I went to Tokyo, and one day at Mr. Masao Kanda's home, I saw Mr. Cao's calligraphy in his study. At that time, I thought that Mr. Cao must have a very good impression of the intellectual class in Japan. Looking back, when I was studying at St. John's University High School in Shanghai, one of Mr. Cao's nephews, named Cao Pu, was also my classmate. Later, he went to the Japanese Military Academy without graduating from high school. I never thought that nineteen years later, the reporter would have the opportunity to meet Mr. Cao.</p>
<p>White Hair and Fireside Light Create an Interesting Contrast</p>
<p>Although Mr. Cao is now living in seclusion as a famous recluse, he has not completely isolated himself from society. He is still serving as the president of the Jingxing Coal Mine Company. Although his single-story Western-style house is not very large, it has an elegant charm. As soon as you step into his house, you can know that this old diplomat knows how to take care of himself. As the reporter took off his coat and walked into the room, a kind old man with white hair came out to greet him. This was Mr. Cao Rulin, whom I had been thinking about for many years. The reporter immediately explained that he had come north at the order of President Chen of this newspaper, and that he had long admired Mr. Cao and had come to pay his respects and send his regards on behalf of the president. Mr. Cao humbly asked him to convey his thanks and invited me to sit next to the stove. The roaring fire in the stove shone on the old man's white head, giving me an extraordinary sense of the seclusion of the century. Since I arrived in Beijing, this fireside chat with Mr. Cao can be said to be the longest. He was in high spirits, and did not show any fatigue in the two-hour long conversation. We must know that he is already seventy years old, but his vitality is probably even stronger than that of Mr. Wang Shulu!</p>
<p>At first, our conversation focused on the recent situation of the Shanghai news media, because Mr. Cao heard that Mr. Li Zanhou had taken over as the president of the Xinwen Bao and had become the president of the National Press Association, so he was very interested. He was also very concerned about this newspaper, and we also moved to talk about the story of Mr. Shi Liangcai in the past. Later, the reporter gradually turned the topic of conversation to Mr. Cao himself. I asked him that I heard that the Allies hoped that he could stand up again for the revitalization of the motherland, but he instead asked the reporter: "When you were in Shanghai, did you also discuss this issue with Mr. Yan Junren?" It was obvious that he was paying attention to Mr. Yan's movements.</p>
<p>Looking Back on the Past, Regret is Endless</p>
<p>Then the topic gradually entered the Sino-Japanese issue. Mr. Cao sighed with emotion and said: "All unfortunate events were caused by the confusion of our country's diplomatic authorities, who often turned a very small problem that could be solved into a huge disaster!" Regarding this point, he pointed out several things to the reporter: (1) After Japan joined the last European War, in order to attack Qingdao, it wanted to land near Longkou to attack the German army's rear. It asked our country for passage, but our country refused, so the Japanese army began to land forcibly. Along the way, because most of the residents refused to sell food, many misunderstandings occurred, which caused discord between the two countries. (2) It was the Wanbaoshan Incident. In the beginning, it was very simple. Because it was inconvenient to draw water from the paddy fields borrowed by the Koreans, the request to expand the rented fields was not approved, and the request to open a waterway was not approved, which aroused an unfortunate dispute, and in a row caused today's catastrophe!</p>
<p>Mr. Cao spoke eloquently about the past diplomatic experience, which made the reporter very interested. The reporter then said: "Regarding the diplomacy in the early years of the Republic of China, we have only read the records in newspapers and magazines. Thinking about it today, there may be misunderstandings. Even with regard to Your Excellency, the general records are not without misunderstandings. I wonder if we can discuss them a little today?" Mr. Cao said: "Some of my materials can be found in Wang Yunsheng's book: China and Japan in the Past Sixty Years. Some have also been destroyed, so I can only give a general account based on my memory at this time!" As he spoke, the servant brought milk coffee and pastries, and we drank coffee and talked. Mr. Cao's main points were in two parts: the Twenty-One Demands and the Nishihara Loans. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Special Edition of the Chinese Art Museum: Origin of the Chinese Art Museum</h3>
<p>Our country has long been known as a nation of cultural relics. The relics left by past generations are not only sufficient for us to examine the origins of our ancestors' creations, but also to observe the traces of cultural evolution. They are the embodiment of the national spirit, and the exquisite art occupies an important position in the world history of art. Therefore, all countries in the East and West have large-scale ancient art museums, which not only preserve the cultural relics passed down from generation to generation in their own countries, in order to promote their culture and art, but also spare no expense to search for ancient Chinese cultural relics, so as to study them and publish books to spread them widely. How prosperous it is! Looking back at our country, although it is an ancient country rich in culture and art, and inherited abundant cultural and artistic relics from our ancestors, the research work on cultural and artistic relics has been neglected. The valuable cultural relics handed down from generation to generation are either flowing into foreign countries or locked up in the hands of collectors, and the public cannot easily see them, which greatly hinders the development and progress of culture and art. In view of this, we have specially set up the Chinese Art Museum to introduce major collectors to exhibit their collections publicly, from bronzes of the Three Dynasties to ancient porcelain of the Ming and Qing Dynasties, distinguish between genuine and fake, examine their origins, and make a systematic display. It not only provides appreciation, but also research, preserves national treasures, and shares them with those who love them. It will be beneficial to the promotion of culture and art in our country. Gentlemen, why not come?</p>
<h3>Importance of Art Museums</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shuru</p>
<p>Clothing should be beautiful, palaces should be beautiful, and the love of beauty is inherent in human nature. The study of fine arts is precisely what suits human nature.</p>
<p>The scope of fine arts is also broad. All cultural relics, regardless of their age or nature, as long as they have artistic expression on them, can be regarded as works of art and used for our people. In recent years, all civilized countries in the world have large-scale art museums, which collect all the cultural relics circulating in the universe, taking from themselves and from others, without being picky, netting them all. This is to prepare for the public's observation and research. The importance of its relationship can be described in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) The cultural relics left by the ancestors of each country are the embodiment of the national spirit. If they are preserved in art museums, the public will inevitably feel their patriotism when they come into contact with them.</p>
<p>(2) For the relics of the ancestors, the earlier ones can be used to study the origins of the ancestors' creations, and the recent ones can be used to observe the traces of cultural evolution. Art museums integrate the relics of ancient and modern art and culture, and introduce the real historical traces of the era in a systematic way, so that viewers can understand them at a glance. From this, they can learn from the past and plan for the future, and the progress of all art and culture will be the driving force for this.</p>
<p>(3) Today is an era of commercial warfare. All industrial and commercial enterprises are striving to improve the aesthetic quality of their products in order to compete for the market. Art museums provide valuable information and open research opportunities for relevant parties, so that they can abandon their own shortcomings and learn from others' strengths. They can also trigger inspiration and express their own ideas, so that their products can make daily progress, win a broad market, and contribute to the prosperity of the country and the wealth of the people.</p>
<p>(4) When we study fine arts, our hearts are immersed in beauty. Over time, it changes our temperament and transforms our nature unconsciously. Therefore, art museums can be said to be social teachers who promote aesthetic education, cultivate the virtues of the people, and form a good and beautiful custom.</p>
<p>The above is only a summary of the greater aspects, and its importance is such. In addition, urban people can spend their spare time admiring art, which can replace all improper entertainment, cultivate their minds, adjust their mental fatigue, and forget the hard work of the day. It is beneficial to both body and mind.</p>
<p>What is regrettable is that our country, as an ancient country in the world rich in art and culture, has inherited abundant relics from our ancestors, but the city of Shanghai, which is known as the Great Shanghai, lacks an art museum, which is undoubtedly a regrettable thing. This is why I am deeply gratified by the determination of you gentlemen to establish the Chinese Art Museum, and I cannot but place unlimited hope on its establishment, hoping that it will grow from a sprout and develop into a wonderful flower in the future, so that our country's aesthetic education can achieve great results and prosper with the national fortune.</p>
<h3>Chinese Art Museum Opens Today, Welcomes Group Visits from Schools</h3>
<p>The Chinese Art Museum will open today at 10:00 AM, with Mr. Lin Kanghou and Zhao Shuru unveiling the event. On display are famous porcelains of all dynasties of China, many of which are rare and exquisite, truly a rare opportunity to appreciate ancient art and obtain spiritual sustenance. A beautifully printed special edition is also prepared, which contains a catalog of the exhibits and details the origins of Chinese porcelain, with more than 20 copperplate illustrations, finely printed on copperplate paper, as a reference for studying Chinese porcelain. It is hoped that all sectors will promote it, and the following official letter is sent to various schools:</p>
<p>Official letter to various schools</p>
<p>To the principals of various schools: We are pleased to inform you that our museum, in order to meet the needs of the times, displays the most artistic famous porcelains of all dynasties of China for public viewing and research, as spiritual sustenance. We hope that you will promote it and welcome teachers, students, and staff from your schools to visit in groups.

Visits are free of charge. Groups can enter with a letter from the school and donate 10 yuan per person to the Shen Bao Education Fund and the Chinese Health Association. Individuals with school identification cards can donate 20 yuan each.

The total amount of donations will be published in this newspaper daily to show credibility.</p>
<h3>A Brief Overview of the Five Famous Kilns of the Song Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhaoping</p>
<p>Chinese porcelain is exquisitely crafted and renowned throughout the world. The porcelains made by the five famous kilns of the Song Dynasty, Ding, Jun, Ru, Guan, and Ge, are particularly well-known. However, there is a popular saying that substitutes Chai for Ding, with the order being Chai, Ru, Guan, Ge, and Ding. The Chai kiln was built in Zhengzhou, Henan during the Xianzheng period of the Five Dynasties. It was named after Emperor Shizong of the Later Zhou Dynasty, who had the surname Chai. The porcelains were all presented to the emperor, and were only known as the Imperial Kiln at the time. It was not until the Song Dynasty that the kiln was named after him. According to legend, Emperor Shizong ordered the manufacture of imperial porcelain, and the officials asked him about the color. The emperor said: "The color after the rain clears up the sky is the color to be made in the future." Later, the color was named "after the rain clears up the sky." The porcelain glaze was as bright as a mirror, the quality as thin as paper, the sound as clear as grain, and the texture as fine as silk. The exquisiteness of its shape is the crown of all kilns since ancient times. However, how can a kiln from the Later Zhou Dynasty be listed in the Song Dynasty? It is appropriate to use Ding, Jun, Ru, Guan, and Ge. Please allow me to briefly describe the outlines of these five famous kilns of the Song Dynasty in order to correct the misnomer.</p>
<p>The Ding kiln was built in the early Song Dynasty, in present-day Ding County, Hebei. The texture of the porcelain is delicate, and those with white and moist colors are considered the most valuable, while those with rough and yellow colors are inferior. Those with tear marks on the outside are genuine, those with carved flowers are the best, and those with plain embroidered flowers and printed flowers are secondary. The glaze was originally bright white, but later followed the trend of adding embellishments, resulting in blue, red, purple, and black colors. Therefore, those with purple color are also called purple Ding, and those with black color like lacquer are called black Ding. In addition, those made in Dingzhou in the early Song Dynasty are called Northern Ding, and those made in Jingdezhen after the Southern Crossing are called Southern Ding. This is because the porcelain imitates Northern Ding and is distinguished by being in the South, not by location. The glaze of Southern Ding is like powder, so it is also commonly known as powder Ding.</p>
<p>The Jun kiln was also built in the early Song Dynasty, in present-day Yu County, Henan. There is a Jun Terrace in the area, hence the name Jun kiln. The porcelain is made of white, gray, red, and yellow textures, with white being the best. The wares have many colors, but the original color was great blue, but because the color was heavy and close to blue, later people named it sky blue. In addition, because the blue material contains copper, it changes to green or red-purple when fired, so the name kiln change arose. Later, copper was used to make red-purple wares, which further exploited its transformation. The Essentials of Natural History states that vermilion red, onion green, red like carmine, green like onion, and purple like black ink, all of which are pure in color without any slight change, are all top grades.</p>
<p>The Ru kiln was built in the first year of the Daguan reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, in present-day Linru County, Henan. This kiln is characterized by blue wares, with a light yellow texture that is fine and firm. The colors include sky blue, egg blue, and powder blue. The glaze is thick and glossy like piled fat, with hidden crab claw patterns and small sesame flower spur marks on the bottom, which are genuine items.</p>
<p>The Guan kiln was built during the Daguan period of the Song Dynasty, in present-day Kaifeng County, Henan. The porcelain is made of white, gray, and red textures, and the refining is extremely pure. White ones often use a black glaze containing iron to protect the foot, and some use pure iron bone mud. The colors include sky blue, emerald green, powder blue, moonlight white, and dark green.</p>
<p>The Ge kiln is the kiln of Zhang Shengyi, a native of Chuzhou in the Song Dynasty. Shengyi had a younger brother named Sheng'er, who made wares in the Liutian Market of Longquan, Zhejiang, so the Ge kiln and the Di kiln are distinguished from each other. The hidden texture of the Ge kiln porcelain is like fish roe, with many broken lines. The color lines are white, and the color of the wares is mostly emerald green, powder blue, light green, and gray-blue. There is also a rice color, which is a variation.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau's Crime Prevention Section Performs a Crime Prevention Play to Publicize Crime Prevention</h3>
<p>The crime prevention play "Turning Back is the Shore," sponsored by the Crime Prevention Movement Publicity Committee of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau and supported by the China Film Company, premiered at the Guanxin Grand Theater yesterday evening at 8:00 PM. The department gave an additional performance at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to entertain leaders from all walks of life in the city, members of the press, and personnel from the police bureau. More than 2,000 guests from all walks of life, including Chen Binhe and Lin Kanghou, attended. Department Chief Li Shiyu was unable to attend due to official business. Yang Yongshi, the head of the Crime Prevention Section, gave a speech on stage, saying:</p>
<p>In order to realize Mayor Chen's noble ideal of making Shanghai a clean and prosperous city, we have launched crime prevention work. For several months, with the careful planning of Director Li and the cooperation of all parties, considerable progress has been made. However, due to the limitations of manpower and financial resources, we have not been able to implement the plan as scheduled. This time, we have specially invited comrades from the China Film Company to perform the play, first as a fundraising, and the proceeds are expected to be deposited in banks and silver firms to generate interest, which will be used as crime prevention expenses and business expenses. The public will manage and use the funds in accordance with the plan. Soon, we will hire experts and scholars to organize a crime prevention research committee, enrich the crime prevention publicity committee, and convene leaders from all walks of life to organize a crime prevention association or a coordination committee to gradually launch the work. The play was performed by male and female stars from the China Film Company, including Bai Guang, Shu Lei, Shu Shi, Yan Jun, and Han Langen. The content of the play was wonderful and the meaning was profound.</p>

<h3>First Division Football Match: Portuguese Merchants Defeat Donghua</h3>
<p>In an exciting First Division football match, Donghua played against Portuguese Merchants at the Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM yesterday. The crowd was packed, making it one of the most exciting football matches of the year. At the beginning of the match, Donghua's forwards were like dragons and tigers, crisscrossing the Portuguese Merchants' penalty area. However, Donghua's luck was extremely poor, and they repeatedly failed to score. After seven minutes, Youliang made a wonderful pass, Vicktai stumbled, and Han Longhai had an open goal, but missed it. After 20 minutes, Fun broke through single-handedly and hooked the ball from the baseline, and Zuo Yi Kai Ma Polo enjoyed the success and shot it into the goal. Soon after, Li Zhuang was injured and re-entered the field after being bandaged, but he has been in bad shape since then. After thirty-five minutes, Pan Tuoxun scored again, and five minutes later, Kai Ma Polo had good luck and scored twice. Donghua lost three goals in the first half. After the break, Donghua counterattacked, but missed many opportunities. After 25 minutes, Fun went down the side and crossed the ball, and Bao Xutuo, who was ill, took the opportunity to score, making it 4-0. After that, Oliveira committed a handball in the penalty area, and Han Longhai took the penalty kick. Little Han lightly pushed the ball, but Pan Enmi caught it. It was not until 35 minutes that Sun Laojin shot a goal from the right corner, breaking the duck. As a result, Donghua lost miserably 1-4.</p>
