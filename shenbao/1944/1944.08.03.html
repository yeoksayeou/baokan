<h3 id="c1">消滅駐渝美空軍 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>問：近來常常看到美駐渝空軍轟炸和平區消息，即如昨日報載本月一日漢口中央社電：“美駐渝空軍以飛機十架左右，侵入武漢地區，轟炸江岸地帶，住宅起火，並有傷亡。”為什麼美空軍這樣的濫施轟炸呢？</p>
<p>答：美駐渝空軍本身力量雖然很為薄弱，可是，他們的野心卻是很大，尤其在重慶統治的區域內，氣焰十分囂張。他們濫施轟炸和平區的目的，表面上說，是對付日本軍事設施，但實際上，不過藉此向本國作為銷而已。</p>
<p>問：既然，美空軍轟炸的目的，不過報銷而已。可是，中國民眾因面遭受生命財產的損失，不可能不多。況且，他們的存在，對於和平統一中國的前途，多少發生障礙的作用，　　如何？</p>
<p>答：不對。美駐渝空軍的力量，我們可以不必重視，但是在和平統一中國前途上的障礙而言，尤其在建設大東亞新秩序的觀點而言，都應該重視的，所以，盟邦日本軍隊最近在中國大陸，發動廣泛戰爭。作戰的目標，就在消滅並驅逐美駐渝空軍。雖然，正面衝突的對象是重慶軍隊，但是正面的目標，卻並不是重慶軍隊，而是美空軍。</p>
<p>問：然則，幾次河南及湖南的戰事，盟邦作戰目的，是否全在消滅美駐渝空軍？不過，事實上中國人民遭受的損害，卻不可估計哩！</p>
<p>答：河南及湖南的作戰目的，當然是在消滅美空軍，這從河南進攻廣氏機場，湖南進攻衡陽機場，以及發動浙贛戰事，都是同樣目的。如無美空軍基地或其勢力所及的區域，並不作為攻擊目標，從這點觀察，更可明白顯示日軍大陸作戰的目的所在。至於日軍為貫徹消滅美空軍目的面轟炸或攻擊，使當地人民遭受損害，不但我們，就是日軍也覺得非常遺憾。</p>
<p>問：依照這樣的趨勢，在美國駐渝空軍未會全部消滅之前，大陸作戰是否不會終止的？</p>
<p>答：這裏，我們要明瞭，在東亞戰爭的本質，是在東亞民族排除英美敵人過去所予我們的桎梏，爭取全民族解放的戰爭，而美駐渝空軍，就是破壞大東亞新秩序建設，就是延續奴役東亞民族的兇器，是東亞全民族的敵人，非徹底消滅不可。所以美駐渝空軍存在一天，盟邦軍隊就予以攻擊一天。這樣大勢所趨的方向，我們大家必須充分暸解的。</p>
<p>問：大勢既然如此，我們怎樣的協力呢？</p>
<p>答：我們是大東亞的一份子，又是參戰國家，我們也有消滅美空軍的責任。軍事上的力量不夠，我們必須加強和平區內的政治力量，經濟力量，使（抗戰）區內的人民的心，一致傾向來歸，孤立重慶力量，那末，美空軍也無立足餘地了。</p>

<p>東京二日中央社電，日政府關於推行決戰施策，乃為當務之急，一日召開閣務　間，各閣僚曾就此次問題，開誠交換意見，蔡小磯。米內栛力內閣成立後，日本民心已為之一新，而團結一致，實為戰爭政治連帶之基調。故今後目的站在此基調之上，施行強而有力加還之決戰準備決戰態勢，從新念達實現各項切要施策，以期擊破當面敵人英美。關於此點，各閣僚意見已完全一致，且決定連手作具體之準備，由此而視，此等施策，實為集中重點戰力，應付決戰之一表現。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電，日新內閣成立後，小磯首相即痛感陸海軍緊密連　，閣內軍官民上下一致團結，實為當前急務，故大各致之口號傳揚各地，戰局高速度進展。美軍已於中部太平洋空軍基地企圖對日挑戰，事實已甚顯，然日政府為對處此種緊迫情勢，此際將發備國內態勢重點，必須移向　　決戰態勢，請求必要措施，新內閣關於組閣後，除舉行閣員議談會外，曾經舉行三次定例閣議，於討論議案之外，對順應決戰具體方策，曾無隔開交換意見，尤以八月一日這定例閣議，各閣員對內政指導之重點，自組閣以來之大和一致，轉向整備順應決戰態勢之問題，意見尤見一致，新內閣之決戰施策，於此已見急速具體化，但實施策之重點於順應決定態勢，從來　施策，需制度似亦將加以必要修正或與廢。</p>
<h3 id="c3">三面圍攻獲捷　日軍進佔蓮花　湖南戰局入決定階段 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>湖南前線日軍某基地二日中央社電　湖南前線日軍右翼，還向江西進攻，予渝第三戰區莫大威脅。上月二十日以來，殲滅萍鄉附近渝軍，一路南下，本月一日　，占領蓮花（萍鄉南方約七十公里）。該地自長沙陷落後，事實上成為渝第九戰區之總指揮處，又為渝第二十九集團軍司令部所在地。由自誇精銳之第二十軍，　當防衛，並有自萍鄉附近撤退之第三十集團軍，第七十三軍駐屯該地，故防禦頗稱堅固，但在日軍三方面圍攻下，終於失陷雲。</p>
<p>湖南前線二日中央社電；湖南戰線之日軍，目下完全制　湖南之山野域名，始終保持主動地位。然因作戰指揮部及野戰軍之無能，徒作無謂犧牲。日軍目前採取誘敵戰術，以進攻衡陽為步驟，渝軍對此還　　，與認已可挽回衡陽戰局，並可確保衡陽，乃戰命始終死守。為謀　陵，茶陵。方面之側面攻擊，及奪回衡陽起見，本月初旬　集中第九戰區之敗殘部隊，且有第三第六第七戰區軍之增援，計以八軍力由東側及南側突入包圍線內，於此無形已墮入日軍戰中。七月十日連結　陵，茶陵，　陽，東西戰線展開第二次殲滅戰。日軍以勇猛奮持之　　，殲滅渝軍八軍之眾，到處均展成功。渝軍為奪回衡陽，集結大量兵力，犧牲慘重。作戰之初，其兵力計十九軍，包括第九戰區第四軍之三師，第二十軍第百二十四師，第四軍之第百六十一師，結果有九軍完全被殲滅，二十五師戰力大損。第九戰區軍於茲完全潰滅。其外日空軍對渝美空軍基地芷江，桂林，柳州，等地，增加控制，從七月一日至二十八日，擊落擊毀幾起火之渝美機，計畫四百八十架以上，給予美空軍打擊甚大。日軍在湖南墮空兩面所舉之戰果，已可決定湖南戰局中國戰場之攻勢，已進入新的決　階段。</p>
<p>衡陽市街展開巷戰</p>
<p>裏斯本二日中央社電：此次空軍當局一日夜發表實況稱，日軍猛攻衡陽市街</p>
<p>達五　之久，繼續激戰　後，卒節入城內　市街，刻正與派守備車展開巷戰。</p>
<p>湖南前線二日中央社電：渝第五十八軍之主力，企圖　　包圍衡陽之日軍部隊背後，　於萍鄉開始行動，對此日軍乃以巧妙之作戰，首先於上月二十六日急戰，佔領萍鄉西方八公里之麻山，制服壓前方陣地。另一日軍部隊亦於二十七日佔領濾溪，斬斷渝軍退路加以包圍。渝軍雖派遣新編百六十二師及九十九師增援，但複遭日軍包圍。至三十日止，四日之間，日軍收穫甚大戰果。渝軍師長等僅以單身脫出，刻渝五十八軍殘滅，故萍鄉，蓮花，遂川間之道路，已全在日軍制壓之下。</p>
<p>空襲柳州收穫偉果</p>
<p>中國日軍某基地一日中央社電：日機　為徹底消滅駐渝美軍。　於二十一日夜，以巨炸機隊轟炸柳州三次。對為補充因日空軍最近幾次所遭損害而　次集中者，予以痛炸。同時更奮起丹竹及梧州兩機場，除　燒廠機共二十二架外，更對滑走路及其他地上設施，施以轟炸，一舉將之粉碎。　日　　炸機隊於二十一日，國惡劣天氣，於二十二日二十八分進柳州，當時黨國渝軍地上炮火，對逃避於柳州機場之敵機，　中轟炸。當即便其大型機七架，小型機三架炸中焚燒，並炸毀其大型機六架，小型機二架，此外更轟架其地上設施三處。另一隊日機　，分別炸毀其設施兩處，此外另一隊日機，　於十時半轟炸走路投彈，悉數命中。查各批日機於轟炸完畢後，全部安返基地。</p>
<p>中國前線某基地二日中央社電：日機於六月三十一日晚攻擊柳州之戰果，其後判明，除　　　外，尚有大型機一架，小型機二架中彈起火外，並有軍事設施二處燃燒。總計渝美空軍損失大型機八架，小型機五架，中彈起火，大型機六架，小型　設施計五處焚燒。該晚之　全戰果，除摧毀燃燒二十四架敵機外，並焚燒軍事設施十處雲。</p>

<p>盟邦上海陸軍部報導部出淵部長，在大東亞戰爭及大陸點綴之報導戰與思想戰上，　功甚偉，業經軍當局晉異中佐之職。出淵氏並於昨（二）日下午二時三刻，假南京路外灘華　　店八樓招待本市中國新聞記者，即席發表湖南方面最近狀況其多。茲分　出淵氏談話如次：</p>
<p>日軍作戰不擾人民</p>
<p>出淵部長首謂，湖南作戰自開始至今，閱時已告二月，在此過程之中，日軍戰果赫赫，惟日軍自作戰當初起，即秉承最高司令官之訓示，貫徹處理作戰方針，忍受一切痛苦，避免中國民眾損害，以不擾民為原則。故作戰以來，日軍一切行動及一切措施，始終在訓示範圍之內。即佔領長沙市時，雖數路包圍進攻，然仍在　全民間福利下作戰，在市內外市街之優點，始終不擾害人民，安然順利進占長沙。頃長沙治安，在日軍迅速發展下，恢復頗速，且市容亦日漸復原，最近本人亦會向諸君說明頗詳，至上月下旬，已宛然與戰前無異。來時居民至七月二十五日止，已有一萬以上。拒料在七月二十六日及二十七日兩全在，敵在渝美空軍竟又作蠢動之舉，向長沙作漫無目標濫放轟炸，投彈頗多燒夷彈，且間難燒炸彈，被炸結果，七月二十六日焚燒民房五六百所約三千所，二日合併損失三千五六百所左右，查長沙全部房屋僅一萬五六千所，故此次受害民房計有五分之一。</p>
<p>敵機轟炸無傷軍事</p>
<p>長沙日軍一本根據道義精神，以不擾民為原則，重要軍隊均不駐城內，僅留一部份軍隊駐守，保護復興長沙市容。敵美空軍之濫施轟炸，雖民間損失不實，而日軍即毫無損害。日軍之不擾民原則，在和平區內不駐軍，經此次敵美空軍之盲目轟炸，結果而日軍一無死傷，此乃明顯之說明。在長沙確無正規日軍駐守，此次被害者乃無辜民間，在軍事設施上更毫無損害。關於長沙市內，人民物體這損失分述下列數點：①當日軍未佔領長沙市，日軍亦恒向長沙轟炸，惟日軍每次轟炸，亦頗為厲害，但目標不同，除軍事設施外，其他一切，絕不加以破壞，更對民間方面，不予損害，其如大部隊之行動，同一無二，惟附近軍事設施之民間，則在不可避免下稍有波及，此外可無一受損。②而敵美空軍之行動，則漫無目標，乏術濫炸，軍事上既無損害，則　害人民，此　足可反映渝美空軍之指揮系統之不一，又毫無紀律，加之意見紛歧，相互對立，以是產生猶豫否定的事實。同時更可觀見美空軍之混亂，無規例的轟炸，在軍事上根本毫無價值，徒然使一般人民遭受痛苦。</p>
<p>渝軍徒供敵美犧牲</p>
<p>出淵部長概述衡陽戰況說，最近二三日之戰鬥，尤為激烈，留守衡陽市內要塞之渝軍尚有渝第十軍三個師，惟軍火告竭，短少非常，一方面日軍重兵佈置之　一般的陣勢，已完全加以包圍。惟衡陽外圍，雖有極少數之渝援救軍，企圖挽救城內孤軍，但日軍雙將該援救軍予以包圍，故在衡陽之情形，已成三夾之　　包圍矣。在衡陽城內之渝軍，正猛烈頑強抵抗，效果甚微。其抵抗原因，可分析下述數點：①根據在衡陽捕獲之渝俘虜之供述，調渝第十軍之根據地，宿城內中國銀行附近，設佈防　大小寫堅固，其中有敵美軍將校五六十人，參與計劃各種作戰。②敵美將校之參預軍事計畫，並加以督戰，因為渝軍猶豫　作頑強抵抗。易言之，　渝方為敵美而犧牲，亦即為敵美而作戰，再從廣泛而觀，關於長沙之轟炸及衡陽城內之頑抗，完全受敵美之唆使及策動，渝軍及一般中國人民徒供敵美犧牲，衡陽戰事雖熾，惟在最近之補給線公路水路等，及已全經日軍確保，故目前戰事當日益激烈，很明確的觀察，日軍方面在作戰上之前途，有相當　把握。</p>
<h3 id="c6">日軍官談衡陽戰況 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>湖南前線日軍某部隊長，一日因要務飛抵此間，當就湖南前線戰況，發表談話包圍講，衡陽包圍圈內之渝軍，因蔣介石氏戰令防備，正在繼續抗戰，但渝軍　受殲滅打擊，早無戰意，然則渝軍因何仍做此無益之抗戰，此實大有檢討之必要。　　軍司令部系設於衡陽市街中央部中國銀行之地下室，在該司令部有最低限定之美籍將校六十人監督渝軍指揮官，此種美籍將校，顯係　反渝軍意志，強　其抵抗日軍者。因此處於包圍網中之第一線，渝軍已陷於進退難穀之境，並傳其中有一部渝軍，因此而自殺。至該方面之美空軍，其出動突襲時，更不認目標，亂施轟炸。　過去吾人亦曾目睹美空軍當長沙失守時，彼等即　轟炸長沙，其行動　　　失，美空軍戰將　零亂，缺少　　，其於空襲時，若遭日方高射炮軍事　轟，基機隊即四分五裂，關於是不認目標，胡亂投彈，隊入雲中遠　此種事實已是司空見慣，因此被害者僅為民從而已，對於日空軍設施，則並無損失。傳最近長沙城內由於美空軍濫炸長沙，市內住宅五分之一約一萬五千戶，已化為灰燼，平均炸毀民戶三千戶，始可使日軍士兵一人輕傷，此為眾所共睹之事實，故歸來長沙　之民眾，其對美機之憤激，遠於極點。但此次日軍兩度攻略長沙時，日軍之轟炸則與之完全不同，　當時除徹底粉碎渝軍　設施外，民眾則無受損害者，美空軍技術之低劣，於此即可見一斑。湖南自遠離戰火後，　地未受點火之害，農民仍日出而作，日入而息，故本年該地區可獲豐收。目下衡陽一帶，仍有若干渝軍存在，但經渝軍破壞之公路及道路，已　　恢復　　，而湘江阮江水運，亦不減於戰前時期之茂盛。</p>
<h3 id="c7">敵機襲帛島　毀墜百十架　襲鞍山喪失兩架 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>

<p>歐戰第五年的夏季，德國從東西南三方面受到敵方的攻擊，戰况均不容樂歡。在一年半的沈默時期中，反軸心軍　馬勵乒，以數最上占壓倒優勢的兵力，希望轉　戰局。然在德國方面，時不可失，這正式獲得利的好機會。因而德當局亦直認今日的德國遭過革事上最嚴重的局面。</p>
<p>重心在西部</p>
<p>那麼德國對這三個正面戰錢以那一面馬電心呢？結論是，去秋以來「東守西攻」的根本戰略，母須有何變更。今日應忍受一切苦痛，不遲疑徘徊，貫澈這旣定方向，實為最善而唯一的活路。德國給與適人當頭棒擊的正面，正應是西部。西部戰綫的艱展，寶是歐洲決戰之鍵。</p>
<p>北法的爭奪</p>
<p>西部戰錢英美軍登陸雖已經一月，但僅占得瑟堡，柯坦汀半島的西半部亦在德方手中。諾曼第沿岸七十公里的橋頭堡，向南方擴大，被德方的反攻所阻，最深部僅達三十公里。是以蒙高茂萊為安定這橋頭堡計，陷克思，桑洛，向南推進，但欲破艦砲射程外的德方陣地，不能不有待於大量重兵器，機械化部隊的增援。可是大部隊登陸時，像現在的狹小地區，極多危險，威脅尚未解除。</p>
<p>以現在所能獲得牧濟部隊與重兵器，雖因瑟堡港的修復而多少強化一點，但結果僅能作極不利的消耗戰，不能與以諾曼第爲根據地而大舉推進的德軍主力決戰。</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓軍的動向</p>
<p>然則擁有四十師以上的美加軍，在英國東南都待機，顯示第二登陸態勢，擬牽制德軍主力的蒙特巴頓軍如何呢？遺支軍隊大舉到諾曼第來援救蒙高茂萊軍的不振呢？或在奧斯登特，狄埃浦方面登陸尋求決戰呢？或折中而自奧納河東岸在塞納河口一帶登陸，立即與蒙高茂萊軍取得聯絡，企間向巴黎方面前進？尚不容預斷。但在今日的階段，敵以諾曼第登陸軍誘引德軍主力的戰略，顯未成功，且使諾曼第成為今後未來決戰之作戰基地的目的現在也決不能說」經完成。而本來預備作別慟軍蒙巴頓軍，究將陸續來此援救，倂爲一軍呢，還是開始向預定登陸基地行動，反致舉　不定。</p>
<p>物資主義</p>
<p>不過這種戰略，不用稅，敵人終將　其絕對優勢的物量，繼續從正面推進的戰略。此次登陸作戰中，以海。陸。空壓倒的優勢而臨的敵人，因後來的損耗而漸露疲勞之色，無可掩飾。共理由；</p>
<p>第一，登陸戰開始後，因速日使用第一錢機的約三分之一，故人員的疲勞，損耗增大，六月份的喪失機數打破紀錢，遂二千架以土。第二，加以因V一號的出現，多數戰們機動員以防禦英本土，而長距離機則動員探杳V一號的濺出基地。第三，南部央國雖行機地被V一號破壞不能應用，增大民心的不安。而且英美空軍在量上雖佔優勢，但V一號如繼績轟炸倫敦，英美雖誇稱仍將連續轟煤柏林及其他德國大都市，但僅有二週前的英美機空襲柏林一次之後即」無聲無息的停止了。</p>
<p>當然，以此事例來說英美在歐洲的空軍優勢已經動搖，自屬過早。至於地上兵力，英美方面準備下的登陸軍兵力，大約為八十至九十師，這是受過敵前登陸建立橋頭堡訓練的師國數，橋頭堡確保後，不僅往英國本土，更有有直接往美國及加拿大分批迅向大陸運輸二百至三百萬的兵力與物資之準備。遺也是應加考慮的。（未完）（譯自七月十日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3 id="c38">為瘋狂的股市一嘆 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>對於華商股票市塲的活動情形，過去我們巳經說過了很多的話，好的地方我們致以稱許，壞的地方我們予以指摘。我們的兄解是：證劵市塲乃是企業家們取得長期資本與儲蓄階　處理他們游資的所在。股票決不是純投機　碼，投票市塲也不是押大押小的賭博所。</p>
<p>但是，近幾年來上海的各種經濟活動，往往不講道理，不走正軌，利之所在，非但大家趨之若驚，且往往把許多良好的法制章則，一古腦兒的推在一邊，不問是非，不擇手段，而只知道伸出手來撈錢。過去半年來，股市的　麼不振，以及最近期問之突然暴騰，都可以說是這一惡劣作風的一貫表現。</p>
<p>說句並不十分武斷的話，大多數的上海人對於股票交易，根本就沒有把牠當作一種正常的買賣。發股票的人，往往只知道一味的利用股票以作騙取散戶資金的工具。今日甲公司，明日乙公司，今日增資，明日升股，弄得市塲上新股充斥，股票籌碼作了不必要的膨脹，另一方面，一般投資股票者又往往以耳代目，亂跟亂闖，不問公司內容，只看大您如何作　，跟風頭，取近利，此外便不知有他。而事之尤為可憾者，則是一般股票經紀人的玩忽職責，吃盤子，放高利貸，濫拉生意。甚至以純買空賣空的方式與客戶對做，終日盡快於塲外交易。而證交當局對於這些又往往熟視無覩，一任股市升沉，不加糾正，因此益發促成了過去股市之不正常的發展。</p>
<p>自從貨價與金價紗漲勢稍定，各地資金稍稍回歸上海，銀根比較　動，而中儲又准許得以優良的股票做押款或用以代繳一部份的存款準備金以後，股市便漸趨進展，日有起色。但不料從此又來一次瘋狂的上漲，在短短的六七天中，把過去半年來所跌去的行市統統都恢復了。有幾種熱門股還創立了新高價，多頭從此揚眉吐氣，但軋空問題也就從此發生。許多專以承做拋空生意為能事的經紀人，尤其被軋得透不過氣，而不得不一方面要求證交停拍，一方面出以無賴式的「結價」以求了結。這一軋空風潮，粗看似乎突如其來，實際乃是過去股市不走正軋的必然流毒。而其中心關鍵則為塲外交易之過份猖厥。在這種塲合，我們以為正是肅淸股市的良好機會，孔明敎訓投機者的良好時機。但不料證交當局的措置却眞是停業一天，這眞令人百恩不解。為什麼證交當局不振肅綱紀，而將那批不守業規的經紀人的執照吊銷，他們巳經在塲外「結價」，難道還不足以反證他們之違法的在塲外交易嗎？「結價」不予取締，反而停泊一天，給結價者以便利，法制何在？體統何在？難道「拋空」應予鼓勵保障，塲外交易應予提倡，不法的經紀人應予以慫通難　嗎？</p>
<p>大戶作做，散戶　說，經紀人荒唐，證交措置失當，眼看當前的股市，眞不能不令人不投筆三　。聞證交監理　　巳將停泊與結價的經過電部請示。我們只拭目以　其後記。</p>

<h3 id="c42">節電及建議 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 徐永熙</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭　發後，感於煤斤缺乏，限制電力減少已經三次，最近報端公佈又將減電百分之五十之稅，惟過去減電方法一部份有不合民情之處，如正當生產工榮受電力之影響，相繼不能開工，以致停閉。但一般消費娛樂塲所，今尚未見電力缺乏之狀態，報端尚有「××冷氣日夜開放」之廣吿，自去年減電以入九十三月平均用電再打折扣之後，現尚有餘電開放冷氣，此項電力從何而來，則非我輩至愚者所能明瞭也。故對此第四次之減電，供默幾項意見如後，以供當局參者，務使適合增產節約之期望。</p>
<p>調整工業用電　過去大部份工廠，早已受電力之限制，相繼停閉，現存者唯一部份小工業而已，資本短小，平日因受市面之不景氣，已難於應付開銷，若此次再減以百分之五十用電，勢必關門大吉，使整個生產工業步上毀滅之途，此對整個民生安定問題不無影響。茲後對工廠之用電可用申請法，若係主要生產工業皆可申請，公司方面加以嚴密詳細調查，擇其需要，得減少其減電奉或免減。</p>
<p>縮短消費塲所營業時間酒菜館，咖啡館，舞塲，總會，遊藝塲均在消費之列，已往各塲所對當局命令，陰奉陽違之事，已有人提及，不再重述，以前當局限制營業時間在十一時前，現不妨再提早一小時或半小時，當局務須切實斷然處之，如不守命令者，立即停止其營業。</p>
<p>限制各戲院開廣塲數對各戲院之開演日期減少之，或一三五停演，或二四六停演，此項措置對戲院實有利而無書。因現今大部份戲院買座並不盛，普通賣座在四五成五空口說白話，並宋生何效力，現只有限期拆除一法，務使其不能使用為止。</p>
<p>禁止夜問叉麻雀滬地叉麻雀風之盛，為了人所共知，其害處傷神傷財，早已有人大加討論，不用細說，值此節約禁賭期間，務應切實禁止，就义麻雀用之電燈，皆在四十支光以上，其一夜所費電力，足供普通用戶十天之用，倘　禁止，對節電方而亦不無補救。辦法可由警務當局與保甲長密切合作，第一次處以勸吿，第二第三次則處以相當嚴重處罰，此項　置，戰前在蘇錫各地亦有實行，應能不賣情而，秉公辦理，定能收成效也。（酬移助學）</p>
<h3 id="c43">急救農村的危機 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 張藝盤</p>
<p>「增加生產」是目前全國一致的迫切要求，也是本年度國府施策的三大急務之一、生產力的充裕與否，關係人類的享受和國家的盛衰。「萬物出於土」，盤事的增產更為重要，增產空氣濃度，而增產之實未現。增產之實所以未現原因，蓋由於政治力的不夠，惡勢力作崇，及農村不寗，經濟貧困等等。照目前農們窘情觀察，確隱藏着莫大的危機。未身歷其境者決難置信，非但原產量不能保持，且有逐步減退的趨勢。</p>
<p>現在農村有一種畸形狀熊，假使你素來是個安分守已夠溫飽的農民，目前就非拜個具有潛勢力的老頭子或寄乾名不可。否則會遭地痞土棍們的嫉親，使你無立足之地。那些流氓都是無業游民，他們日常靠翻花樣過活，紅帖亂飛，什麼做害啦，結婚啦，打秋風抽頭聚睹，萬干進出，不足為奇，養成他們游手好開的習性。於是良好的農民也被他們同化了，棄大好耕種）與之合羣，這此鳥合之了實過勝</p>
<p>非政府規定的苛捐雜稅是盤村的至命傷，常超過田賦稅的幾倍，今天防軍柴草捐，明天自衛　夫捐，奇特名詞層出不窮。盤民茍延殘喘，呌苦不迭，深至敢怒而不敢言，規定日期如不送去，說不定請你吃皮鞭吃槍桿，他們沒有度抗的能力，祗有忍痛低首。終至足夠溫飽的農民　途他業，造成反常現象。</p>
<p>平時農民已很困苦，經過戰爭的摧殘，收成的銳減，每多前吃後空；加之年來物資統制，常局低價收買，他們希望換到低價配給，實際早被不健全的配給機關剝削中飽。及至農民到手，數量極微。於是祗好抑求黑市，造成物資交流背道而馳的局面。農耕不夠成本，一般視耕種為畏途，甚多趨向單着。</p>
<p>農民前吃後空，農耕時期資本困難，勉力借到比印子鈿超幾借的高利貸支持。大家期侍着次期電收成淸償債務。稻榖登塲時期，市面充實，糧食貶價，農民不顧低價出售，苦於偵主催促，祗有忍痛出售以償債務。價格越低賣出越多，甚且運應保留的食糧，也要買光，如此急切希望政府當局趕速運用强力的政治力量，救濟農村，撫戟流氓，取締苛捐雜稅，調整配給，吸取都市游資組織銀行團，導遊資於正途，加强農貸，廉農村治安確立，經濟繁榮，農民樂於生產，增產目的始達。工商亦必隨之復興，則民生幸甚，國運幸甚。（移酬貸學）</p>

<p>例如，以汽油機關實行半潛航，這也是當時重要課題之一。六號艇的速度，是水上入海里，水中四海里，其他艇的速度也都差不多。潛水艇既有「海龜」的綽號，所以當事者希望要保持其隱密性，並且爭取水上航行相近的速度和航程。</p>
<p>但遷是非常危險的事，尤其是在水面上露着日本烟管似的通風管而潛航，所以大波浪一壓過，則立刻就有浸水的危險。還有在通風管上安放着一個塞關，如看着有浸水危險時，關閉上就可以了，但問題是在於是否來得及，這就必須冒很大的險。佐久間上尉在性能最壞的六號艇上，竟大胆來嘗試其司明治四十三年（一九一○年）四月十一日，第一潛水隊從瀨戶內海向別府方面巡航，但憲例六號艇是不能參加行動的，在四月十五日，與母艇歷山丸一同在內海實行操作，而駿向新湊沖。時間曾是上午九時五十分，當時佐久間上尉就開始半潛航的賞驗。</p>
<p>這時的六號艇，曾陷於全潛航的狀況，但歷山丸以為是開始潛航訓練，而並沒有加以注意。實際上，當日也想同時舉行海底沈沒的實驗。</p>
<p>但因潛航時間太長，所以逐漸感覺到有變，而立刻把這種情形報吿給碇泊於吳鎭的母艦韓崎號。韓崎立刻又報吿鎭守府，所以很多驅逐艦和水霍艇都被派到該地來。在上關的母艦豐橋也急忙駛來，從事日夜不斷的搜索沉沒地方。至翌日十六號下午三時，富土和伊吹兩號的艦載水雷艇，終於發見了沈沒的艇體。但搶救是很困難的，於是就拖到淺水地方去，這是十七號的下午一時的事。</p>
<p>按當時潛水艇的設備說，經過那樣久的時間，誰都不會認為能有活人。但問題只是在於希望知道最初帝國海軍潛水艇遇難的情形。實際上，當時不久以前，某國海軍也曾發生過同樣事件，而艇上人雖曾醜態百出，令人髮指。</p>
<p>最先鑽到六號艇去的士中校和中城上尉的心坎上，悲痛中含有相當複雜的情緒。</p>
<p>但中校在狹仄的艇內巡視一週後，高喊了一聲「好！」，便放聲大哭了。（一二七）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Eliminating the US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Question: Recently, I've frequently seen news about the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombing peaceful areas. For instance, yesterday's newspaper reported a dispatch from Hankou's Central News Agency on the 1st of this month: "Around ten US Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing intruded into the Wuhan area, bombing the Jiang'an area. Residences caught fire, and there were casualties." Why is the US Air Force indiscriminately bombing like this?</p>
<p>Answer: Although the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing's own strength is quite weak, their ambitions are great, and they are especially arrogant within the area controlled by Chongqing. The purpose of their indiscriminate bombing of peaceful areas is ostensibly to target Japanese military facilities, but in reality, it is merely to justify their expenses to their own country.</p>
<p>Question: Since the US Air Force's bombing is just for justifying expenses, Chinese civilians inevitably suffer loss of life and property. Moreover, their presence poses some obstacle to the future of a peaceful and unified China, isn't that so?</p>
<p>Answer: Incorrect. We don't need to take the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing too seriously, but their obstacle to the future of a peaceful and unified China, especially from the perspective of building a New Order in Greater East Asia, should be taken seriously. Therefore, allied Japanese forces have recently launched a widespread war in mainland China. The target of the operation is to eliminate and expel the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Although the direct target of the conflict is the Chongqing army, the real goal is not the Chongqing army, but the US Air Force.</p>
<p>Question: Does that mean the aim of the several battles in Henan and Hunan was entirely to eliminate the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing? However, the damage suffered by the Chinese people is inestimable!</p>
<p>Answer: The objective of the operations in Henan and Hunan was, of course, to eliminate the US Air Force. This is evident from the attack on the Guangshi Airport in Henan, the attack on the Hengyang Airport in Hunan, and the launch of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign, all with the same goal. If there were no US Air Force bases or areas within their sphere of influence, they would not be attacked. From this perspective, the objective of the Japanese army's operations in mainland China is clear. As for the damage suffered by the local people due to the Japanese army's bombing or attack in order to achieve the goal of eliminating the US Air Force, not only we but also the Japanese army feels very regretful.</p>
<p>Question: According to this trend, will the mainland operations not end until the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is completely eliminated?</p>
<p>Answer: Here, we need to understand that the essence of the East Asian War is a war for the East Asian peoples to cast off the shackles that the British and Americans have imposed on us in the past and to strive for national liberation. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is a weapon that destroys the construction of the New Order in Greater East Asia and continues to enslave the East Asian peoples. It is the enemy of the entire East Asian people and must be completely eliminated. Therefore, as long as the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing exists, the allied forces will attack it. We must all fully understand this general trend.</p>
<p>Question: Since the general trend is like this, how can we cooperate?</p>
<p>Answer: We are a part of Greater East Asia and a participating country. We also have a responsibility to eliminate the US Air Force. If our military strength is insufficient, we must strengthen our political and economic power within the peaceful areas, so that the hearts of the people in the (anti-Japanese) areas will lean towards us, isolating the Chongqing forces. Then, the US Air Force will have no place to stand.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan Prepares for Decisive Battle; All Cabinet Members Agree on Actively Strengthening Production and Air Force Capabilities <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government considers the implementation of decisive battle measures to be an urgent task. A cabinet meeting was convened on the 1st, during which cabinet members exchanged candid opinions on the issue. According to Prime Minister Koiso, the Japanese people's morale has been renewed since the establishment of the Koiso-Yonai cabinet, and unity is the foundation of war and politics. Therefore, the objective is to build on this foundation, implement vigorous and decisive battle preparations, and realize various essential measures to defeat the enemy, the United States and Great Britain. All cabinet members fully agreed on this point and decided to work together on concrete preparations. From this perspective, these measures represent a concentrated effort to focus combat power and cope with the decisive battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - After the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, Prime Minister Koiso keenly felt that close cooperation between the army and navy, and the unity of military and civilians within the cabinet, were urgent tasks. Therefore, the slogan of "Great Unity" was promoted throughout the country, and the war situation progressed rapidly. The US military has attempted to challenge Japan from air bases in the central Pacific, which is very obvious. However, in order to cope with this urgent situation, the Japanese government must shift the focus of its domestic preparations to a decisive battle posture and request necessary measures. In addition to holding cabinet meetings, the new cabinet has held three regular cabinet meetings after its formation. In addition to discussing agenda items, they have openly exchanged opinions on concrete strategies for adapting to the decisive battle. In particular, at the regular cabinet meeting on August 1st, cabinet members expressed unanimous agreement on the issue of shifting the focus of domestic policy guidance from the emphasis on unity since the formation of the cabinet to the preparation for a decisive battle. The new cabinet's decisive battle policies have rapidly become concrete. However, the focus of implementation is on adapting to the decisive battle posture, and existing policies will also be subject to necessary revisions or repeal.</p>

<p>A certain Japanese army base on the Hunan front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The right wing of the Japanese army on the Hunan front is also advancing towards Jiangxi, posing a great threat to the Third War Area of Chongqing. Since the 20th of last month, after annihilating the Chongqing army near Pingxiang, it has marched south and occupied Lianhua (about 70 kilometers south of Pingxiang) on the 1st of this month. After the fall of Changsha, this place had in fact become the general command post of Chongqing's Ninth War Area and the location of the headquarters of Chongqing's Twenty-ninth Army Group. It was defended by the 20th Army, which boasts of being an elite force, and also had the 30th Army Group and the 73rd Army, which had retreated from the vicinity of Pingxiang, stationed there, so the defense was quite solid, but it finally fell under the three-sided attack of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army on the Hunan front is currently completely controlling the mountains and fields of Hunan and has always maintained an active position. However, due to the incompetence of the war command and field army, they are making unnecessary sacrifices. The Japanese army is currently adopting a tactic of luring the enemy, with attacking Hengyang as a step. The Chongqing army still fails to recognize this and believes that it can salvage the Hengyang battle and ensure Hengyang, so it is ordered to defend to the death. In order to plan a flanking attack on Liling and Chaling and retake Hengyang, the defeated remnants of the Ninth War Area were concentrated in early August, and reinforcements from the Third, Sixth, and Seventh War Areas were added, totaling eight armies, which broke into the encirclement line from the east and south. In this way, they have unknowingly fallen into the battle of the Japanese army. On July 10th, the second annihilation battle was launched on the east-west front connecting Liling, Chaling, and Hengyang. The Japanese army used its bravery and perseverance to annihilate eight armies of the Chongqing army and achieved success everywhere. The Chongqing army concentrated a large number of troops and suffered heavy casualties in order to retake Hengyang. At the beginning of the operation, its forces totaled nineteen armies, including three divisions of the Fourth Army of the Ninth War Area, the 124th Division of the 20th Army, and the 161st Division of the Fourth Army. As a result, nine armies were completely annihilated, and the combat power of twenty-five divisions was greatly damaged. The Ninth War Area army has been completely destroyed here. In addition, the Japanese air force increased control over the US Air Force bases in Chongqing, Zhijiang, Guilin, and Liuzhou. From July 1st to 28th, it shot down or destroyed more than 480 Chongqing-US aircraft that were set on fire, inflicting great damage on the US Air Force. The results achieved by the Japanese army in Hunan, both in the air and on the ground, have determined the offensive of the Chinese battlefield in Hunan and have entered a new decisive stage.</p>
<p>Street Fighting Unfolds in Hengyang City</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Air Force authorities issued a factual statement overnight, stating that the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on the streets of Hengyang for as long as five days. After fierce fighting, they finally entered the city and are currently engaged in street fighting with the garrison forces.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 2nd (Central News Agency): The main force of Chongqing's 58th Army attempted to attack the rear of the Japanese army units surrounding Hengyang and began operations in Pingxiang. In response, the Japanese army launched a swift battle on the 26th of last month with skillful tactics, occupying Mashan, eight kilometers west of Pingxiang, and controlling the forward positions. Another Japanese army unit also occupied Luxi on the 27th, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat and encircling it. Although the Chongqing army sent the newly formed 162nd Division and 99th Division to reinforce it, it was again encircled by the Japanese army. By the 30th, the Japanese army had achieved great results in four days. The Chongqing army division commanders and others escaped alone. The remnants of the Chongqing 58th Army have been annihilated, so the roads between Pingxiang, Lianhua, and Suichuan are all under Japanese control.</p>
<p>Great Results from Air Raid on Liuzhou</p>
<p>A certain Japanese army base in China, 1st (Central News Agency): Japanese aircraft, in order to completely eliminate the US forces stationed in Chongqing, bombed Liuzhou three times with a heavy bomber fleet on the night of the 21st. A heavy blow was dealt to the forces that had recently concentrated there to replenish the damage suffered by the Japanese Air Force in recent attacks. At the same time, the Dantan and Wuzhou airfields were attacked, and in addition to burning a total of 22 enemy planes, the runways and other ground facilities were bombed and destroyed. On the 21st, due to bad weather, a Japanese bomber fleet approached Liuzhou at 20 minutes past eight on the 22nd. At that time, the Chongqing army's ground fire hit and bombed enemy aircraft fleeing to the Liuzhou airport. Seven large aircraft and three small aircraft were immediately hit and burned, and six large aircraft and two small aircraft were destroyed. In addition, three ground facilities were bombed. Another team of Japanese aircraft separately destroyed two facilities, and another team of Japanese aircraft bombed the runway at 10:30, all hitting the target. All the Japanese aircraft returned safely to base after completing the bombing.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese army base on the China front, 2nd (Central News Agency): As a result of the Japanese aircraft's attack on Liuzhou on the evening of June 31, it has been clarified that in addition to the aircraft, one large aircraft and two small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two military facilities were burned. In total, the Chongqing-US Air Force lost eight large aircraft and five small aircraft, and six large aircraft and small facilities were burned in five places. The total results of the battle that evening, in addition to destroying and burning 24 enemy aircraft, also burned ten military facilities.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Director Izubuchi Discusses the Hunan War Situation; Chongqing Army Stubbornly Resists, Sacrificing Themselves for the Enemy <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Director Izubuchi of the Allied Army Reporting Department in Shanghai has made great contributions to the information and ideological warfare of the Greater East Asia War and the mainland campaign, and has been promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Colonel by the military authorities. Mr. Izubuchi also invited Chinese newspaper reporters from this city to the Hua Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road at 2:45 p.m. yesterday (2nd) to deliver a speech on the recent situation in Hunan. The following is a summary of Mr. Izubuchi's speech:</p>
<p>Japanese Army Operations Do Not Disturb the People</p>
<p>Director Izubuchi first stated that the Hunan operation has been going on for two months since it began. During this process, the Japanese army has achieved remarkable results. However, since the beginning of the operation, the Japanese army has adhered to the instructions of the Supreme Commander, implemented the operation policy thoroughly, endured all suffering, avoided harming the Chinese people, and adhered to the principle of not disturbing the people. Therefore, since the operation, all actions and measures of the Japanese army have always been within the scope of instructions. Even when occupying the city of Changsha, although the attack was carried out in several directions, the operation was still carried out under the welfare of all the people, and the city and streets inside and outside the city were never disturbed, and Changsha was safely and smoothly occupied. The security of Changsha has been restored rapidly under the rapid development of the Japanese army, and the city appearance is also gradually restored. Recently, I have also explained to you in detail that by the end of last month, it was almost the same as before the war. By July 25, there were more than 10,000 residents. Unexpectedly, on July 26 and 27, the enemy's US Air Force made a stupid move and carried out aimless and indiscriminate bombing of Changsha, throwing a lot of incendiary bombs and, occasionally, difficult to burn bombs. As a result of the bombing, 500 to 600 houses were burned on July 26, about 3,000 houses, and a combined loss of about 3,500 houses in two days. It is found that there are only 15,000 to 16,000 houses in Changsha, so about one-fifth of the houses were damaged this time.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Bombing Does Not Harm Military Facilities</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Changsha adheres to the principle of not disturbing the people based on the spirit of morality. Important troops are not stationed in the city, and only a part of the troops is stationed to protect the restoration of Changsha's appearance. Although the indiscriminate bombing of the enemy's US Air Force caused substantial losses to the people, the Japanese army was not harmed at all. The Japanese army's principle of not disturbing the people and not stationing troops in the peaceful area, as a result of this blind bombing by the enemy's US Air Force, resulted in no casualties to the Japanese army. This is a clear explanation. There are indeed no regular Japanese troops stationed in Changsha. Those who were harmed this time were innocent civilians, and there was no damage to military facilities. Regarding the loss of people and objects in Changsha, the following points are described: ① When the Japanese army did not occupy Changsha, the Japanese army also constantly bombed Changsha, but the Japanese army's bombing was also quite severe every time, but the targets were different. Except for military facilities, everything else was never destroyed, and no harm was done to the people. Its action like the movement of a large troop is the same and nothing else. However, the civilians near the military facilities will be slightly affected under unavoidable circumstances, and no one else will be damaged. ② The actions of the enemy's US Air Force are aimless, lacking indiscriminate bombing techniques. There is no military damage, so it harms the people. This can reflect the inconsistency of the command system of the Chongqing-US Air Force, and there is no discipline, and opinions are divided and mutually opposed, so the facts of hesitation and negation arise. At the same time, it can be seen that the US Air Force's chaotic and irregular bombing is fundamentally worthless militarily, but only causes suffering to the general public.</p>
<p>Chongqing Army Sacrifices Themselves for the Enemy</p>
<p>Director Izubuchi outlined the battle situation in Hengyang and said that the battles in the past two or three days have been particularly fierce. The Chongqing army defending the fortress in Hengyang City still has three divisions of the Chongqing 10th Army, but the ammunition is exhausted and very short. On the one hand, the Japanese army has completely surrounded the general situation of the heavy troops. However, although there are very few Chongqing rescue troops on the periphery of Hengyang attempting to save the isolated troops in the city, the Japanese army will surround the rescue troops, so the situation in Hengyang has become a three-way encirclement. The Chongqing army in Hengyang City is resisting fiercely, but the effect is very small. The reasons for its resistance can be analyzed as follows: ① According to the confessions of the Chongqing prisoners captured in Hengyang, the base of the Chongqing 10th Army is near the China Bank in the city, and it has a strong defense. There are fifty or sixty enemy US military officers who participated in planning various operations. ② The enemy US officers participate in military plans and supervise the battle, because the Chongqing army is hesitating to make a stubborn resistance. In other words, the Chongqing side is sacrificing for the enemy, that is, fighting for the enemy. From a broader perspective, the bombing of Changsha and the stubborn resistance in Hengyang City are completely instigated and instigated by the enemy. The Chongqing army and the general Chinese people are sacrificed for the enemy. Although the battle in Hengyang is fierce, the supply lines, highways, and waterways have all been ensured by the Japanese army recently, so the current war will become more and more fierce. It is very clear to observe that the Japanese army has considerable prospects in the war.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Japanese Officer Talks About the Battle Situation in Hengyang <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain unit commander of the Japanese army on the Hunan front flew here on the 1st due to important business. When he spoke about the battle situation on the Hunan front, he stated that the Chongqing army within the encirclement of Hengyang is continuing to resist due to Chiang Kai-shek's war order. However, the Chongqing army has been annihilated and has long since lost its will to fight. Why is the Chongqing army still doing this useless resistance? This is indeed a matter that needs to be reviewed. The army headquarters is located in the basement of the Bank of China in the central part of Hengyang City. There are a minimum of 60 US officers supervising the Chongqing army commanders at the headquarters. These US officers are obviously opposing the will of the Chongqing army and forcing them to resist the Japanese army. Therefore, the Chongqing army on the front line of the encirclement net is in a difficult situation to advance or retreat, and it is said that a part of the Chongqing army committed suicide because of this. As for the US Air Force on that side, when they launch a surprise attack, they do not recognize the target and bomb indiscriminately. In the past, we have also witnessed the US Air Force bombarding Changsha when Changsha was lost. Their actions are out of control, the US Air Force's generals are scattered, lacking orders, and when they are attacked by the Japanese high-altitude anti-aircraft guns, the base fleet is torn apart. In this regard, it is commonplace not to recognize the target, throw bombs indiscriminately, and the team enters the cloud and runs away. Therefore, only the people are victimized, and there is no loss to the Japanese Air Force facilities. It is said that recently, due to the US Air Force's indiscriminate bombing of Changsha, one-fifth of the houses in Changsha, about 15,000 households, have been reduced to ashes. On average, 3,000 households have been destroyed, which can slightly injure one Japanese soldier. This is a fact that everyone has witnessed, so the people who returned to Changsha are extremely angry with the US aircraft. However, when the Japanese army attacked Changsha twice, the bombing by the Japanese army was completely different from that. At that time, in addition to thoroughly destroying the Chongqing army's facilities, the people were not harmed. The low level of US Air Force technology can be seen from this. After Hunan was far away from the war, the land was not harmed by fire, and the farmers still worked at sunrise and rested at sunset, so the area can harvest a bumper harvest this year. At present, there are still some Chongqing troops in the Hengyang area, but the highways and roads destroyed by the Chongqing army have been restored, and the water transportation of the Xiangjiang and Yuanjiang Rivers is no less prosperous than before the war.</p>

In 1918, he went to France to study, and returned to Thailand in 1928 to serve as a technician in the Communications Department of the Ministry of Transport, which was his first step into technical officialdom. In June 1934, he was elected as an official member of the National Assembly. The following year, he entered the cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio. After that, he successively served as Acting Minister of Economy, Acting Deputy Minister of Education, Minister of Transport, and Minister of Commerce.

This year, he was elected as the Deputy Speaker of the Assembly.

<p>Guangzhou, 2nd – Central News Agency Dispatch: The Guangxi Daily, recently published in Guilin, issued a commentary entitled "Beware of Japan's Political Offensive," pointing out the fact that a war-weary atmosphere permeates the people. The gist is recorded as follows: The recent Japanese military offensive has been fierce, and the people's defeatist thinking has become even more profound. At the same time, soldiers are also trying to avoid war, retreating and deserting. We have experienced seven years of resistance, and today we have a little confidence in obtaining the "final victory," which should be fully reviewed and self-criticized. The reasons for this are nothing more than political corruption and the incomplete mobilization of the people. In the past, we were able to use morale and political power to stop the Japanese offensive to a certain extent, but now we have lost these two important conditions for resistance. We did not expect that the situation of the seven-year resistance would regress to this point. In short, our crisis is imminent, and our future destiny will depend on whether this situation can be rebuilt.</p>

<p>Bulgarian Concern</p>
<p>Sofia, 1st – Central News Agency Dispatch, Transocean News Agency: As the decision on Turkish foreign policy is imminent, and before the Turkish Parliament convenes, a tense situation has emerged in Sofia. Officials and newspapers have remained silent and have not commented. Regarding Turko-Bulgarian relations, all major politicians agree that maintaining peace in the Balkans is in the common interest of both countries. Therefore, the Bulgarian people naturally feel uneasy about changes in Turkish foreign policy. Although the great pressure from the anti-Axis powers on Turkey cannot be ignored, it is hoped that influential Turkish politicians will not be forced to make decisions that are detrimental to the common interests of Bulgaria and Turkey.</p>

Several residential areas have caught fire, especially in the southwest and south, causing considerable damage and casualties.

<p>In the summer of the fifth year of the European War, Germany was attacked by the enemy from the east, west, and south. The war situation was not optimistic. During the year and a half of silence, the anti-Axis forces, armed to the teeth, hoped to reverse the war situation with overwhelming force. However, on the German side, time was of the essence, and this was an excellent opportunity to gain an advantage. Therefore, the German authorities also directly admitted that today's Germany is facing the most serious situation in its history.</p>
<p>Focus on the West</p>
<p>So which of these three fronts does Germany focus on? The conclusion is that the fundamental strategy of "defending the East and attacking the West" since last autumn must not be changed. Today, the best and only way to survive is to endure all suffering and implement this established direction without hesitation. The front where Germany gives the enemy a head-on blow should be the West. The development of the Western Front is the key to the decisive battle in Europe.</p>
<p>The Struggle for Northern France</p>
<p>Although the British and American troops have landed on the Western Front for a month, they have only occupied Cherbourg, and the western half of the Cotentin Peninsula is still in German hands. The 70-kilometer bridgehead on the Normandy coast has been expanded to the south, but is blocked by the German counter-offensive. The deepest part is only 30 kilometers. Therefore, in order to stabilize this bridgehead, Montgomery advanced southward, capturing Caens and Saint-Lô, but in order to break through the German positions beyond the range of naval guns, it was necessary to wait for the reinforcement of a large number of heavy weapons and mechanized units. However, landing large forces in a small area like the present is extremely dangerous, and the threat has not yet been lifted.</p>
<p>With the troops and heavy weapons that can be obtained at present, although it has been strengthened a little due to the repair of Cherbourg port, the result can only be an extremely unfavorable war of attrition, and it is impossible to have a decisive battle with the main force of the German army advancing on a large scale with Normandy as its base.</p>
<p>The Movements of the Mountbatten Army</p>
<p>Then what about the Mountbatten Army, which has more than 40 American and Canadian divisions waiting in southeastern England, showing a second landing posture, trying to contain the main force of the German army? Will this army come to Normandy to rescue Montgomery's underperforming troops? Or will it land in the Ostend and Dieppe areas to seek a decisive battle? Or will it take a middle ground and land on the east bank of the Orne River in the Seine estuary, immediately connect with Montgomery's army, and attempt to advance towards Paris? It is still impossible to predict. But at the present stage, the enemy's strategy of using the Normandy landing army to lure the main force of the German army has obviously not succeeded, and the purpose of making Normandy an operational base for the future decisive battle cannot be said to have been completed. And will the Mountbatten Army, which was originally prepared as a separate army, come here to rescue in succession and merge into one army, or will it start to move towards the planned landing base, but lead to indecision?</p>
<p>Materialism</p>
<p>However, this strategy, without taxes, will eventually use its absolutely superior amount of materials to continue to advance from the front. In this landing operation, the enemy, who came with overwhelming superiority in sea, land, and air, gradually showed signs of fatigue due to subsequent losses, which could not be concealed. The reasons are:</p>
<p>First, after the start of the landing battle, about one-third of the first-line aircraft were used quickly, so the fatigue and losses of personnel increased. The number of aircraft lost in June broke the record, exceeding 2,000. Second, in addition, due to the appearance of the V-1, most fighters were mobilized to defend the British mainland, and long-range aircraft were mobilized to detect the launch bases of the V-1. Third, although the airfields in southern England were damaged by the V-1 and could not be used, the anxiety of the people increased. Moreover, although the British and American air forces have an advantage in quantity, if the V-1 continues to bomb London, although the British and Americans boast that they will continue to bomb Berlin and other major German cities, there has been no news since the Anglo-American air raid on Berlin two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Of course, it is too early to say that the Anglo-American air superiority in Europe has been shaken by this example. As for the ground forces, the British and American sides have prepared a landing force of about 80 to 90 divisions. These are the number of divisions that have been trained to land in front of the enemy and establish bridgeheads. After the bridgehead is secured, not only will they go to the British mainland, but there are also preparations to directly transport 2 to 3 million troops and supplies in batches from the United States and Canada to the mainland. This should also be taken into consideration. (To be continued) (Translated from the Yomiuri-Hochi, July 10)</p>

<p>Shortwave Radio Transmitters: Strict Prohibition of Use and Concealment – Statement by the Japanese Military Police Captain</p>
<p>On December 18th of the year before last, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy issued a proclamation prohibiting the use of shortwave radio transmitters, stipulating that anyone who possesses such a radio transmitter must send it to the authorities for modification. The proclamation has been in effect for a year and a half, but it has been found that there are still a considerable number of people concealing prohibited radios and using them secretly. Recently, the Shanghai Military Police conducted an investigation and found that a considerable number of large commercial firms were secretly concealing prohibited radios. This shows that there are still a large number of prohibited radios remaining in Shanghai, which is the source of malicious rumors. The military authorities have decided to actively crack down on this. On the 2nd, the captain of the Shanghai Military Police issued a statement, issuing a serious warning to violators. The statement is recorded as follows: The Shanghai Military Police is cracking down on those who secretly conceal and use prohibited radios, and have found a considerable number of violators. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy issued a proclamation on December 18, Showa 17 (1942). The prohibition of the manufacture, use, and transfer of these prohibited radios is a well-known fact. Despite repeated and thorough guidance by the authorities concerned, there are still those who arbitrarily conceal them, neglecting the prohibition to an extreme degree. The Shanghai Japanese Military Police will not tolerate those who violate the Japanese military proclamation, and will confiscate them, imprison them, fine them, and suspend their business in accordance with military law. In the future, violators will continue to be inspected from time to time in order to ensure the security of the law. In addition, those who report themselves before being discovered will be given lenient treatment in accordance with the circumstances.</p>

<p>Electricity Use Restricted Again: Earnest and Voluntary Conservation – Statement by Secretary-General Wu</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu of the Municipal Government made the following statement regarding the re-restriction of electricity use: Electricity is necessary for modern urban life, but in this time of war, with reduced coal production and inconvenient transportation, every country and every city is deliberately seeking ways to save electricity. Electricity use in this city has been restricted since last December, and a summer electricity conservation campaign was also launched in May of this year. Although each has achieved considerable results, and most citizens are aware of the need to conserve voluntarily, a closer examination of electricity use in some areas still reveals considerable waste, and there is still room for further restriction. For example, electric fans, elevators, heating and cooling equipment, electric machines for entertainment and games, electric lights for shop windows and signs, non-public swimming pools, electric bulbs above 100 candlepower, and electric lights for outdoor vendors, etc. Although it may be permissible to install more equipment in normal times, in times of war when resources are scarce, all things should be conserved. The cessation of supply will not have a great impact on the lives of citizens. The government has consulted with the relevant parties and decided to prohibit the supply of the above-mentioned equipment from August 1, which has already been announced. As for some flexibility in the implementation, it will still be considered. After this restriction, all users must earnestly shut down, so as not to be subject to penalties such as power outages. Electricity use in other family homes and offices should also be fully exhausted. It is hoped that everyone will conserve electricity to avoid even greater inconvenience when resources are scarce.</p>

<p>Inspector Zhou of the First District Took Office in Zhoupu Yesterday – Warm Welcome from Various Agencies and Organizations</p>
<p>Zhou Huarren, Administrative Inspector of the First District of Shanghai Special Municipality, went to Zhoupu Town on the 1st to take office. Various local agencies and public organizations held a mass welcome meeting in the square in front of the Inspector's Office. After Inspector Zhou delivered a speech, he met with representatives of various groups and agencies and issued a written statement to reporters. A grand soccer performance was held in Zhoupu Park at 4:00 PM, with more than 3,000 spectators, creating an exceptionally enthusiastic atmosphere. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcome Situation</p>
<p>Inspector Zhou arrived in Zhoupu at 10:00 AM. At that time, more than a thousand people, including the Nanhui District Office, the Zhoupu District Office, Tao Xuesheng, deputy commander of the North Bridge District Security Team, Chen Ge, deputy commander of the team, agency representatives, and representatives of public organizations, were holding flags in front of the car to welcome him. Zhou shook hands with representatives of various groups as a courtesy, and then accompanied his entourage into the public office and gave a brief speech to thousands of people standing in the square in front of the public office before they dispersed.</p>
<p>Written Statement</p>
<p>Huarren was ordered to supervise the administration of Nanhui, Fengxian, and Shenchuan counties and will begin work on August 1. At the beginning of the work, everything will be simplified. At this time, when the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive stage, although the jurisdiction is in the rear, it is located in a strategic area and is a barrier to Greater Shanghai. The duty lies in upholding the government's three major policies—ensuring security, increasing production, and rectifying thought—and striving to supervise subordinates so that the central government's policies are implemented in the local government. Furthermore, I will uphold Mayor Chen's purpose of honesty, integrity, and love for the people and practice it personally so as not to fail in my duties. The office of the public office has just been established, and there are many things to be dealt with. I hope that my fellow countrymen and elders, as well as the long-term officials of the allied countries, will come forward and teach me. It is a great honor for me and a great honor for the region.</p>
<p>Grand Soccer Game</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM, all sectors of Zhoupu Town held a grand soccer performance in the town's park to celebrate the August 1 Renaissance Festival and welcome Inspector Wu's arrival. Before the game, Inspector Zhou led the ceremony, and Chief Jian Dong, director of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Office, gave a speech to the people in the field. The two sides of the soccer performance were the famous Chinese and Western teams in Shanghai: the Lianyi team and the West team, which was a disguised form of the police team. The two teams had more than 30 members, all of whom came to Zhou from Shanghai. Before 3:00 PM, the field was already full of spectators, with an estimated 3,000 people. At exactly 4:00 PM, Inspector Zhou performed the opening kickoff ceremony. The strength of the two sides was equal, and the competition was fierce, so the performance was full of highlights. The first half ended with a score of 4 to 3, with the West team slightly ahead. In the second half, under the leadership of team captain Xu Wenkui, Lianyi launched a strong counter-attack, and the final score was a draw. The total result was 6 to 6.</p>

<p>Bai Chang Hang Offers Bonus for Scholarship Bai Chang Hang Shanghai General Office wrote: "Respected Chief Editor, With great respect, our company is re-issuing the 'Cherish Resources and Create Wealth' coupon (the first time was held six years ago, and the first prize winner, Miss You Zhongying, was drawn by the Jin Xing Factory on Weihaiwei Road). The original intention was due to a shortage of raw materials, encouraging users to exchange empty tin toothpaste, hair cream, and face cream bottles for this coupon. Therefore, each coupon has a number, and the winning number is based on the welfare lottery number drawn on July 31st. Unexpectedly, the first prize-winning 'Create Wealth' coupon was not drawn this time. Our company does not dare to be opportunistic or selfish and is willing to donate the entire first prize amount of 200,000 yuan to your newspaper and the News newspaper's student loan fund. We are now sending 100,000 yuan in savings to your newspaper's account, hoping that you will receive it and distribute it to poor students of all levels.

<h3 id="e38">A Sigh for the Frenzied Stock Market <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Regarding the activities of the Chinese stock market, we have said a lot in the past. We have praised the good aspects and criticized the bad aspects. Our understanding is: the securities market is where entrepreneurs obtain long-term capital and where savers manage their floating capital. Stocks are by no means purely speculative chips, and the stock market is not a gambling place for betting big or small.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, various economic activities in Shanghai have often been unreasonable and unorthodox. Where there is profit, not only do people flock to it in shock, but they often push aside many good laws and regulations, regardless of right or wrong, and without choosing means, they only know how to reach out and grab money. The recent stagnation of the stock market over the past six months, as well as the sudden surge in the recent period, can be said to be a consistent expression of this bad style.</p>
<p>To say something not entirely dogmatic, most people in Shanghai do not treat stock trading as a normal transaction at all. People who issue stocks often only know how to use stocks as a tool to swindle funds from retail investors. Today Company A, tomorrow Company B, today increase capital, tomorrow raise stock prices, making the market full of new stocks, and the number of stock chips has been unnecessarily inflated. On the other hand, ordinary stock investors often use ears instead of eyes, follow blindly, and do not ask about the company's content, only looking at how big households operate, following the trend and taking short-term profits, and knowing nothing else. What is even more regrettable is the negligence of duty by ordinary stock brokers, eating plates, lending at high interest rates, and soliciting business indiscriminately. Some even conduct over-the-counter transactions with customers in a purely short-selling manner, rushing to trade outside the market all day long. The securities exchange authorities often turn a blind eye to these things, allowing the stock market to rise and fall without correction, thus further contributing to the abnormal development of the stock market in the past.</p>
<p>Since the price of goods and gold and the rise in yarn have stabilized slightly, funds from various places have returned to Shanghai slightly, the money market has been relatively relaxed, and the Central Reserve Bank has allowed good stocks to be used as collateral or to pay part of the deposit reserve, the stock market has gradually progressed and improved day by day. But unexpectedly, there was another frenzied rise from then on. In just six or seven days, all the market prices that had fallen in the past six months were restored. Several popular stocks even established new high prices, and the bulls finally raised their eyebrows, but the problem of short squeezes also arose from then on. Many brokers who specialize in short-selling business were especially squeezed out of breath, and had to ask the exchange to stop trading on the one hand, and issue rogue-style "settlement prices" to seek settlement on the other hand. This short squeeze seems sudden at first glance, but it is actually the inevitable poison of the unorthodox operation of the stock market in the past. The central key is the excessive prevalence of over-the-counter transactions. In this situation, we believe that this is a good opportunity to clean up the stock market, a good time for Kong Ming to teach speculators. But unexpectedly, the measures taken by the exchange authorities were actually to suspend business for one day, which is really confusing. Why don't the exchange authorities rectify discipline and revoke the licenses of those brokers who do not abide by the rules of the industry? They have already "settled prices" outside the market. Isn't that enough to prove that they are illegally trading outside the market? Instead of banning "settlement prices," they suspend business for a day, giving convenience to those who settle prices. Where is the legal system? Where is the decency? Is it possible that "short selling" should be encouraged and protected, over-the-counter transactions should be promoted, and illegal brokers should be condoned?</p>
<p>Big players operate, retail investors lose money, brokers are absurd, and the measures taken by the exchange are inappropriate. Looking at the current stock market, I really can't help but stop writing in despair. I heard that the securities exchange supervision has telegraphed the ministry to ask for instructions on the suspension and settlement prices. We can only wait and see for the sequel.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Electricity Conservation and Suggestions <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Yongxi</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the shortage of coal, electricity restrictions have been reduced three times. Recently, the newspapers announced that electricity will be reduced by another 50%. However, some of the past electricity reduction methods are not in line with public sentiment. For example, legitimate production industries are affected by electricity and cannot start work one after another, resulting in shutdowns. However, general consumption and entertainment venues have not yet seen a state of electricity shortage. Newspapers still have advertisements such as "×× air conditioning open day and night". Since the reduction of electricity last year, after discounting the average electricity consumption in September, there is still surplus electricity to open air conditioning. Where this electricity comes from is beyond the understanding of the most foolish of us. Therefore, regarding this fourth reduction in electricity, I offer a few suggestions for the authorities to consider, so as to meet the expectations of increasing production and saving money.</p>
<p>Adjust Industrial Electricity Consumption: In the past, most factories were already restricted by electricity and shut down one after another. The only remaining ones are small industries with short capital. They have difficulty meeting expenses on weekdays due to the sluggish market. If the electricity is reduced by another 50% this time, they will inevitably close down, putting the entire production industry on the road to destruction. This will have an impact on the stability of the entire people's livelihood. In the future, the electricity consumption of factories can be applied for. If it is a major production industry, it can be applied for. The company will conduct a strict and detailed investigation to select those that are needed and reduce or exempt the electricity reduction fee.</p>
<p>Shorten the Business Hours of Consumption Venues: Restaurants, cafes, dance halls, clubs, and amusement venues are all in the category of consumption. People have mentioned the matter of various venues disobeying the orders of the authorities in the past, so I won’t repeat them. Previously, the authorities limited business hours to before 11:00 PM, and now it may be possible to move it forward by another hour or half an hour. The authorities must deal with this decisively and resolutely. Those who do not comply with the orders will be immediately stopped from operating.</p>
<p>Limit the Number of Performances in Theaters: Reduce the number of performances in theaters, or stop performing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, or stop performing on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. This measure is actually beneficial to the theaters. Because most theaters are not very popular now, the average seat sales are four or five percent. Empty talk is of no use.

<p>Prohibit Playing Mahjong at Night: The prevalence of playing mahjong in Shanghai is well known. Its harm, injury to the spirit and finances, has long been discussed by people and does not need to be elaborated. During this period of conservation and gambling ban, it should be strictly prohibited. The electric lights used for playing mahjong are all above 40 watts. The electricity spent in one night is enough for ordinary users to use for ten days. If it is prohibited, it will also help to save electricity. The method can be for the police authorities to cooperate closely with the Baojia chiefs. The first time will be a warning, and the second and third times will be a relatively severe punishment. This measure was also implemented in Su and Xi before the war and should be able to handle it impartially without selling affection, and it will definitely achieve results.

<h3 id="e43">Averting the Rural Crisis <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yipan</p>
<p>"Increase Production" is currently the unanimous and pressing demand of the nation, and also one of the three major urgent tasks of the National Government this year. The abundance or lack of productivity is related to the enjoyment of humankind and the prosperity or decline of the nation. "All things come from the soil," so increasing agricultural production is even more important. The call for increased production fills the air, but the reality of increased production has not yet appeared. The reason why the reality of increased production has not appeared is due to insufficient political power, the prevalence of evil forces, the unrest in rural areas, and economic poverty, among other things. Observing the current plight of farmers, there is indeed a great crisis hidden. Those who have not experienced it firsthand can hardly believe it; not only can the original output not be maintained, but there is also a trend of gradual decline.</p>
<p>There is currently a kind of deformed situation in rural areas. If you have always been a peaceful and self-sufficient farmer, you must now find a powerful old man to associate with or become his nominal adopted son. Otherwise, you will be envied by local bullies and ruffians, leaving you with no place to stand. These hooligans are all unemployed vagrants who live by trickery. Red invitations fly everywhere, for things like setting traps, getting married, freeloading and extorting, gambling, and large sums of money come and go; this is not uncommon, cultivating in them the habit of being idle and lazy. As a result, good farmers are also assimilated by them, abandoning good farming practices to join them. These temporary alliances are actually worse.</p>
<p>Unofficial taxes and miscellaneous levies that are not stipulated by the government are the mortal wounds of rural villages, often exceeding several times the land tax. Today, there's a levy for firewood and grass for the defense army; tomorrow, a levy for the militia. Bizarre terms emerge endlessly. Farmers eke out a meager existence, constantly complaining, to the point where they are angry but dare not speak out. If they don't deliver the payment by the specified date, they might get beaten with whips and rifle butts. They have no ability to resist, so they can only lower their heads and endure the pain. Eventually, farmers who were once able to sustain themselves turn to other occupations, creating an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>Farmers are already very distressed in normal times. After the ravages of war, harvests have been sharply reduced, and they are often living beyond their means. In addition, due to years of materials control, the government agencies often buy at low prices, and they hope to exchange for low-price rations, but in reality they have long been exploited and embezzled by unsound rationing agencies. By the time the farmers receive the rations, the quantity is extremely small. So they have no choice but to seek the black market, creating a situation where the exchange of materials goes against the grain. Farming is not enough to cover the cost, and people generally regard farming as a dangerous path, with many tending towards abandoning it altogether.</p>
<p>Farmers live beyond their means, and capital is scarce during the farming season, forcing them to borrow high-interest loans at rates much higher than usury. Everyone looks forward to the next harvest to repay their debts. During the rice harvest season, the market is saturated, and food prices depreciate. Farmers, disregarding the low prices, are forced to sell because they are under pressure from debt collectors, and they can only endure the pain and sell to repay their debts. The lower the price, the more they sell, and even the food that should be reserved for sustenance must be sold off. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the government authorities will quickly use strong political power to provide relief to rural areas, pacify hooligans, abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies, adjust rationing, attract urban idle capital to organize banking consortia, guide idle capital to proper channels, strengthen agricultural loans, establish rural security, promote economic prosperity, and make farmers happy to produce, so that the goal of increased production can be achieved. Commerce and industry will also inevitably revive, then the people will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. (Moved repayment for academic study)</p>

<p>A letter from Nanyang Hospital states: "Previously, considering the difficult lives and heavy responsibilities of elementary school teachers, this hospital held free tuberculosis screenings from May 1st to July 31st to express our hospital's humble intention to serve society. Now that this program has ended, we are gratified by the excellent results, thanks to the assistance of all parties. Furthermore, considering that children are the pillars of the nation in the future, the Nanyang Group, during this extraordinary period, recognizes that malnutrition can easily lead to illness, and that the most serious cases can affect them for life and impact the nation. Considering this, we dare not neglect our position as medical professionals and strive to remedy the situation in hopes of averting the worst. In particular, we feel unlimited sympathy for students receiving scholarships and loans, who are generally outstanding but from impoverished backgrounds. Therefore, we have agreed on a free children's health checkup program and scheduled its implementation. We are sending you a copy of the program and respectfully request your assistance, which we eagerly anticipate."</p>
<p>All children receiving scholarships from Shenbao and loans from Xinwenbao are eligible to benefit from this program.</p>
<p>The term "children" in this program refers to those in need of examination who can go directly to the social service departments of the two newspapers, Jia Xin. Each person receives a form, which, after being signed by the department as pertaining to the child, is taken to the social department of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital at 77 Luoyang Road, where they will obtain an examination certificate and be sent to the relevant departments for examination. The form will be filled in with details and treatment recommendations.</p>
<p>Examination dates: Tentatively set for four months, from October 10th to December 9th, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, excluding Sundays and public holidays.</p>
<p>Number of examinations: Tentatively set at 25 people per day, with the number to be increased as the weather cools down.</p>

<p>A letter from Mr. Liu Bonian states: "Years of disasters continue, and the people's livelihoods are difficult. As we enter summer, epidemics are rampant, and the suffering of the poor and sick is even deeper. The current situation is dire, like a pestle pounding away. Therefore, I have donated 55 art folding fans made by myself, originally given to Hexie, worth a total of 16,500 yuan, together with 50,000 yuan raised through Liu Dunyu Hall, totaling 66,500 yuan, to your organization's poverty relief fund, to fulfill my personal wish to relieve poverty and sickness and to care for the orphaned and destitute. In addition, Liu Dunyu Hall has donated 10,000 yuan to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Herewith, I am submitting three receipts. I hope you will keep them and provide a receipt."</p>
<p>Liu Dunyu Hall, with a compassionate heart, generously provides aid. In addition to scholarships, it also spends a large sum to help the poor. Its enthusiasm for public welfare is truly a model for society. And Mr. Bonian, not deterred by the trouble, not only donated and sold art folding fans but also went around raising funds for Liu Dunyu Hall, acting bravely for a righteous cause, which is truly commendable! On behalf of the impoverished people who benefit, we express our deepest gratitude.</p>
<p>We have heard that Mr. Liu, in order to further realize his grand vision of relief, is preparing to offer another 1,000 of his beautiful folding fans in the near future for a charity sale broadcast on the radio. All proceeds will be donated to our poverty relief fund. His tireless dedication to good deeds is truly admirable. It is anticipated that enthusiastic members of society will show great sympathy and respond to the charity event at that time.</p>

<p>The specialist school for clerical studies, organized by this newspaper, has hired many leading figures in the literary world as instructors. Their teaching is conscientious and thorough, and the tuition fees are affordable for working youths. The relationship between teachers and students is harmonious. Since its opening on May 1st, the first class of more than 70 students has completed their studies after three months. The closing ceremony was held last Sunday (July 30th) at the Republic of China Middle School on Weihaiwei Road. The ceremony began with an opening speech by Chairman Huang Jingwan, followed by speeches from guests and instructions from the instructors. The ceremony was simple and solemn. All the students simultaneously formed a Clerical Studies Research Association to continue their studies, learn from each other, and improve the morality and learning of the youth in order to achieve excellence. Many guests from all walks of life attended that day, creating a lively atmosphere. (Hui)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Blood and Tears (8) Navy <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Shutō Ideshi, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>For example, using gasoline engines to achieve semi-submerged navigation was also an important issue at the time. The speed of the No. 6 boat was 8 nautical miles on the surface and 4 nautical miles underwater. The speed of other boats was about the same. Since submarines had the nickname "Sea Turtle," those involved hoped to maintain their concealment and strive for speed and range similar to surface navigation.</p>
<p>But migration was very dangerous, especially when navigating with the snorkel, which looked like a Japanese pipe, exposed on the surface of the water. If a large wave crashed over it, there was an immediate danger of flooding. There was also a plug on the snorkel that could be closed if there was a danger of flooding, but the problem was whether there was enough time, which required taking a big risk. Lieutenant Commander Sakuma boldly attempted this on the No. 6 boat, which had the worst performance. On April 11, Meiji 43 (1910), the First Submarine Squadron was cruising from the Seto Inland Sea to Beppu. However, according to regulations, the No. 6 boat was not allowed to participate in the operation. On April 15, it operated in the Inland Sea with the mother ship Alexander Maru, heading towards Shinminato Offshore. The time was 9:50 AM, when Lieutenant Commander Sakuma began the experiment of semi-submerged navigation.</p>
<p>At this time, the No. 6 boat was in a fully submerged state, but the Alexander Maru thought it was the beginning of submerged navigation training and did not pay attention. In fact, they also wanted to conduct an experiment of sinking to the bottom of the sea at the same time.</p>
<p>However, because the submergence time was too long, they gradually felt that something was wrong and immediately reported the situation to the mother ship Hanasaki, which was anchored in the Wu Naval Base. The Hanasaki immediately reported to the Naval Base, so many destroyers and water minesweepers were dispatched to the area. The mother ship Toyohashi, which was in Seki, also rushed over to search for the sunken place day and night. At 3:00 PM on the 16th of the following day, the naval mine sweepers of the Fuji and Ibuki finally discovered the sunken hull. But rescue was difficult, so it was towed to a shallow water area. This was at 1:00 PM on the 17th.</p>
<p>According to the equipment of submarines at that time, no one would have thought that there could be any survivors after such a long time. But the only question was whether they wanted to know the situation of the first accident of the Imperial Navy submarine. In fact, a similar incident had occurred in a certain country's navy not long ago, and the people on board had behaved shamefully, which was outrageous.</p>
<p>The hearts of Lieutenant Colonel Shizhi and Lieutenant Commander Nakashiro, who were the first to drill into the No. 6 boat, contained a rather complex emotion in their grief.</p>
<p>But after inspecting the narrow boat for a week, the lieutenant colonel shouted "Good!" and burst into tears. (127)</p>
