<h3>日軍攻陷宜山　直接威脅貴陽　桂境戰事入最後階段</h3>
<p>桂林十七日中央社電　日軍攻陷桂林柳州後，復沿黔桂路展開新運動，遂於十四日佔領宜山。攻陷宜山之日軍，仍沿黔桂路猛進，越過廣西省境重疊山嶺地帶，進入貴州省境則爲直接威脅印度方面渝軍輸血路，自側面制渝方之死命。按宜山位於龍江海峽，爲自廣西平原地帶入貴州山境之要衝，到柳州不出百公里，賓爲貴州省之門戶。因宜山陷落，西南渝軍最後防衛據點之貴陽，亦直接遭受威脅。又以桂林柳州之陷落，駐渝美空軍基地及軍政各機關軍需資材之撤退，均集中貴陽，故貴陽現已化爲軍事都市，其危急亦日迫矣。</p>
<p>里斯本十七日中央社電　路透社駐渝訪員，頃就桂省日軍今後行動觀測如次：由於日軍攻陷桂省二中央都市後，桂境戰事已入最後階段，現日軍之動向，有三可能性，即：（一）日軍向貴州方面迅速行進。（二）於繼續進攻前，先穩固既已佔領之地區。（三）於貴州省境附近暫時停止攻勢作戰。日軍進入桂省非僅一次，過去會二度進入桂省南部，其後均經撤退。然而次日軍似有繼續保守長沙·衡陽·及桂省各要衝之意　云。</p>
<p>中國民衆協力日軍</p>
<p>廣西前綫日軍某基地十七日中央社電　當日軍突破桂湘省境，開始對渝第四戰區發動進攻作戰之時，桂省民衆曾努力編組自警團及國民軍，以供展開遊擊作戰。惟其後由日軍作戰之進展，軍紀之嚴明，以及中國派遣軍最高指揮官之發出佈告，對於日軍作戰之真意，豁然瞭解，於是此等所組織之自警團與國民軍，乃漸次解除武裝，翩然來歸，並進而組織治安維持會，作積極之協力。其尤足注目者，賓爲住民對日軍之直接協力，蓋日軍快速部隊，在由某地附近開始行動佔領宜山以前，其進撃路以一山岳地帶非常峻險，且由於連日大雨，道路泥濘，致使運輸武器彈藥秣之馬匹，相繼渝於溝緊，此實爲空前未有之困難行軍。惟各地治安維持會，目矚此種實情後，即相日軍當局報告，願以人力協力日軍運輸燃料彈藥糧秣，同時當日附近之農民，亦曾致手執棒籠之屬，協力日軍，當是日軍與中國民衆即　　一體，在泥濘道路上，開始行軍，卒能突破惡路若干公里。至於燃料彈藥糧秣，均由中國民衆駢手觝足，予以搬運，而駐渝美空軍據點柳州·柳城·宜山·各地，遂由此相繼爲日軍快速部隊所攻略。</p>
<h3>汪主席遺訓</h3>
<p>（一）共有大東亞戰爭勝利，才保得住東亞，才保得住中國。</p>
<p>（二）彼此以親愛精神之心，舉精誠團結之實。</p>
<p>（三）認定了一個方向，而勇往前進，則必能接近於光明。</p>
<p>（四）貪污凟職是腐蝕政治的惡菌，囤積居奇是荼毒民主的蠢虫。</p>
<h3>最高國防會議　昨開例會</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　最高國防會議，於十七日上午九時，舉行第五九次會議。此次會議爲主席逝世後第一次會議，全體起立，默念誌哀。通過以全國經濟委員會組織條例規定，特派傳式說爲全經會委員，並指定爲常務委員。</p>
<h3>王克敏昨北返</h3>
<p>南京十七日中央社電　華北政務委員會委員長王克敏氏，爲恭祭汪故主席，日前由平飛京，業於昨十七日上午十時，偕王蔭泰·素體仁·及隨員等，搭機北返。</p>
<h3>渝公務員免役　引起輿論反對</h3>
<p>廣州十七日中央社電　最近渝方之廣播及報紙，連日對學生及知識階級之從軍事，展開活潑之宣傳。渝當局方面亦相繼發表談話，力言抗戰之危機，以期達成動員青年之目的。此外各地已開始強制徴募工作，然迄今毫無效果，而民兵團之募集，因各機關團體徴募免除辦法，更引起青年廣之深切反對。最近韶關日報，曾以此爲題，撰著社論，謂公務員不僅不應免除兵役，且宜率先從軍，以爲青年模範。此對於渝軍當局之不公措置，大事攻擊云</p>
<h3>日駐保公使　離保京赴土</h3>
<p>布達佩斯十七日中央社電　德國社訊：日本駐索菲亞公使自日保兩國絕交後，已於星期三乘專車離去保京前往斯丹埠。</p>
<h3>汪精衛先生軼事　之三</h3>
<p>睇攔齊逞臆談云：昔之談革命者，無不及汪先生，今之言當治者，無不及汪先生，則先生之於國家，未當不負人望也。先生字精衛，浙之山陰人，父某，當游幕於粵，家於番禺，因寄籍焉。自幼聰穎，懷大志，喜讀書，過目成誦，少長學　於日本，識孫中山先生於東京，孫先生奋其才，恒就其密議滅滿復漢事。先生曰：「清政不修久矣，邇且三歲小孩爲帝，不亡何待。」孫先生題之。遂如同盟會，與章太炎（炳麟）共任民報撰述，爲文痛斥清政之失，輒娓娓數千言。宣統末造，偕黃復生（樹種）濟如北都，稅屋而居，詭稱商人，足不出戶，二人暗埋地雷，謀炸攝政王載灃，事洩露入法部獄。法部尚書廷杰。議處以極刑，肅親王善耆，方筦民政部，力持不可，調革命黨人週天下，旦夕且爆發，先生文人無能爲，不若久鋼，徐訊其黨之秘計，即不能盡得起賓，得其半或一二，足以資戒備，廷杰動容，需焉。善耆以語廷杰復語載灃，載灃亦調然，先生得不死。辛亥變作出獄，知袁世凱爾部皆　兵符，行將起用，約其子克定，偕往洹上，見世凱資以大義，動以輿情，調逐幼帝滅清廷改建民主共和政體，此其時矣，世凱感其誠，隱衷稍稍吐，先生乃南帥，歸而參與南北和議。迨臨時政府成立於南京先生宣言不爲官吏，不作議員，組織六不會，有六不規約。蓋其時廣東省人，方舉其爲粵督，政府復將大用之也。臨時參議院既因孫先生一言，略舉世凱爲臨時總統，孫先生立遣先生及蔡元培上迓之，世凱慮有變，憚南行，陰使心腹第三鏙曹錕所部譁變，焚掠京津，藉口北方無人坐鎮，元首宜緩行，政府應北選，其間經過種種，人人能到不贅。當世凱之得衣膺臨時總統之選也，先生力爲多，非如比則南北必久戰爭，清帝遜位將無期，統一之局，莫由成立，世凱死後，北軍勢漸衰，年復一年，一蹶不振。近數年間，先生始入黨國政府，嗣以政見不合而退，好作政論，尤喜談法理，爲白話體衷，然成集，間爲詩，詩亦警備，肖其爲入。</p>
<p>秋梧業談云：廖仲愷之被刺也，汪先生立往醫院視之，見已氣絕，於悲動中，屢屢搖首，乃親寫告同志一文，張於中央黨部。時黨部仍在惠州會館，翌晟黨員人人見之，紛紛傳錄，內有警句謂：「不革命者向右邊走，革命者向左邊走」。左派之起源，實基始於此云。當民國初元，汪先生常赴友人議，在廣州東橫街某宅樓上，酒擺倚闌，闌朽傾裂，人從三樓閃跌而下，幸墜地不傷，然亦險矣。（錄自張江裁所編「汪精衛先生行實錄」）</p>
<p>代論</p>
<h3>如何實現汪主席遺志</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨應本市宣傳處置邀，對於如何實現汪主席遺志，作廣播講，茲將講詞移載於此。</p>
<p>國民政府主席汪精衛先生逝世瞬已過一週了，一週以來，各方所表示的哀悼，足以告慰於汪先生在天之靈。</p>
<p>第一，全國官民以及盟邦人士，對於汪先生同聲致其肅穆的悼敬，這已證明汪先生生前偉大的人格，以及爲國家爲東亞的精神，獲得了中外各方面的愛戴。身軀雖死，而精神實已永生。</p>
<p>第二，舉國於哀悼中莫不保持極度的鎮靜，不論中樞政事以及各層社會，平定如常，不僅毫無不安現象，且都有益加奮勉，繼承遺志的決意。和運必成，戰事必勝，於此可得充分保證。</p>
<p>第三，汪主席的繼承者，已由中樞推定陳公博先生承乏。陳先生也是黨國先進，才識卓越，，更與汪先生久共患難，相知最深，這次繼任艱鉅，必能出其過去從政的經驗，公正的態度，完成汪先生未竟之志。</p>
<p>第四，盟邦當局於汪先生逝世後，已經正式表示對華政策絕不變更。仍將繼續盡其最大協力，加強兩國間的密切關係，共同爲爭取大東亞戰爭勝利而努力。這也是中華民族獨立解放的保障。</p>
<p>然而，我們不能以維持現狀爲滿足，反之，應在汪先生逝世以後，格外發奮，加倍努力。首先希望於政府當局，是澈底革新政治，剷除貪官污吏，建立專家政治。</p>
<p>我們過去一貫主張，革新政治，建立專家政治，所以，對於今後政府一切設施，務須適合這一原則。第一，大公無私，放棄黨派觀念，因事擇入，務必才職相稱。第二，識拔在野人才，因爲在野的正直有爲之士，每苦無事可做，以致湮沒浪費，政府應悉心訪求，予以效命的機會，是野無遺才。第三，賞罰嚴明，在朝官吏，著有劣績者，應毫不姑息予以撤懲，以收澄清吏治政治清明之效。</p>
<p>其次，改善行政機耩，加以合理調整，例如事權不清重床疊架的駢枝機關，無事可做的閑散機關，均予臨併或裁撤。不但免除許多無調的官樣文章，以及不必要的牽制。並可將節餘的經費來充實做事的機關。惟有政治上軌道以後，推行國策才有成效。</p>
<p>再次，當次大東亞戰爭決戰階段，我們必須加強戰爭必勝的信念，而尤須發揮民間力量攻陷於戰爭。因此，首先改善人民生活。目前民生最感痛苦者，一爲治安未能確立，一爲物價高漲不已。確立治安，應從改善軍警待遇入手：抑平物價，應從防止暴利入手。</p>
<p>我們悼念汪主席，不能僅在口頭上文字上表示就算了事的。我們必須脚踏實地，在實際行動上努力，共同實現汪主席的遺志，這才是哀思之道。</p>
<h3>日首相官邸　昨盛大晚宴　招待緬巴莫國家代表</h3>

<p>此次訪日目的</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　巴莫代表十六日下午再迎賓館接見記者，發表談話如次：本人亦緬甸國家代表資格，承蒙天皇陛下會見，洵覺無上光榮與感謝。天皇陛下對吾國民尤作種種垂詢，我人對大東亞共同宣言之實現，與今日之光榮，絕常銘記，內心永弗能忘。又稱：本人此次訪日，第一目的乃爲協議日緬兩國各項共同問題，此等問題，爲關係完隨大東亞戰爭之問題，自不待言，同時，本人更願親現戰局下日本國民毅然奮起之詳情。關於日民總武裝之消息，雖早已得知，然究係如何完成總武裝之詳情，尤以在精神方面，如何產生「神風特別攻擊隊」一點，更願稍知其概略。此外爲使緬甸進一步得到日本朝野之援助，與本人欲藉此機會一訪在日親友故交，同時希望日緬兩國國民，今後愈盆緊密提携，俾徹底完成大東亞戰爭。</p>

<p>期待已久之進擊命令終於發出，此日各艦官兵之激奮心情，實不可言喻，於接受待機命令時，各艦早已將戰鬥必需準備布置就序，下午由旗艦打出各艦長集合信號，此即進擊命令之開始。當次戰意昂揚之大機動部隊一路南下時，以警戒潛艇之航行序列，繼續做「之一字形運動，翌日天清氣朗，乃最適於進擊之天氣。那不就菲律賓附近敵軍行動之消息，已逐漸傳來，最後終於接到雷伊泰灣附近已又有敵軍新登陸作戰展開，其中敵有力機動部隊分爲數軍，於菲律賓東方海面行動中。至此空前之戰機已告成熟，全員受艦長命令，開始作海軍體操，不久艦隊已到達某島東方，決戰時機更益迫近。據電報稱，敵機動部隊現正以雷伊泰灣登陸點爲中心，於菲律賓東方一帶分爲數軍，已在行動中，於此即將開始決戰之前，參謀室頓呈緊張狀況，是日晟，日偵查機一架，發現敵機動部隊已軍，爲空母數艘，特級空母若干艘，戰艦，巡洋艦二十數艘組成之機動部隊，隨之發出攻擊命令，戰鬥轟炸機聯合編隊多架，由空母出發，分作兩　，突入戰場。第二　客服困難條件，高翔雲間，終發現敵以有力空母數艘爲基幹之機動部隊，當即加以奇襲猛攻，突破敵方猛烈之防擊砲火，向大型空母作集中轟炸，飛行甲板命中炸彈多枚，繼而炸聲隆隆，艦身傾斜外，有大型母艦亦吐露火燄，相繼沉沒，敵新式空母完全殲滅。然尚存有特級空母，日機攻擊隊方面轉即目標，不期遭敵方優勢之戰鬥機群攻擊，不得已歸返基地。他方海上部隊亦突然出現於雷伊泰灣，攻擊灣內之敵艦群，敵措防不及，艦隊陷於潰亂狀態，日艦隊乘機以巨砲痛擊，合計六十餘艘之敵空母戰艦，巡洋艦等，戰果逐步擴大，日艦隊更分別突入敵運輸船團及其護衛艦群內，加以肉搏，是時，上課有敵機隊出現，日艦隊當即迅速散開，防空砲火齊吼，敵機連續墮落，是時忽然又敵機魚雷一發，向日空母射來，是時驅逐艦見情，以全速突入魚雷發射位置，與魚雷相接爆炸起火四處，艦身被火烟包圍，前部砲塔仍想敵機吐露火光，驅逐艦終代替空母而沉沒。次日敵機蔽空轟炸五次，日旗艦發出命令，全軍決死夜襲，擊沉敵艦隊而後止，隨之整頓隊形以驅逐艦保護主力部隊，一絲不紊，在黑暗還沒前進，於深夜於敵艦遭遇，砲聲隆隆，展開壯烈之肉搏夜襲，戰數分鐘後，海面復趨沉寂。此次至少擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，待主力抵達後，敵艦均倉惶向南方退卻，日艦隊乃反轉北上，菲律賓海面之海戰於斯告終。」</p>
<h3>菲政府頒布　強制勞動令</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十七日中央社電　洛勒爾大總統爲使菲律賓國民協力日軍勞務作業，十四日特頒布強制勞動令，李卯迭將軍並對此發表談話如次：敵美恃其物豈，現已在菲律賓一帶登陸，目下菲律賓已早逢非當時局，危機已迫近國民各自身邊。洛勒爾大總統曾宣布參戰，且對世界闡述菲律賓之立場，然菲律賓國家尚未實行徵兵以增護衛祖國之實力，故吾菲律賓國民對於參戰工作究在何處，日軍爲擊滅敵美，以防衛菲律賓之國防綫，不僅處以最大犧牲，即菲律賓各地之勞務作業，亦大部由日軍負責。吾菲律賓全體國民，應以日軍犧牲精神，而努力從事勞務作業，以減輕日軍之負担，積極協力完逐戰爭，此爲菲律賓國民之義務，更爲吾人唯一可協力戰爭之途。</p>

<p>東京十七日中央社電　雷伊泰島戰爭日趨激烈，敵方向塔克羅班，塔拉克，布羅音，塞巴布羅各空軍基地增援，積極奪取制空襲。日航空部隊對此，連日攻擊其基地及作截擊，十六日夕，日戰爭機部隊猛炸布羅音敵機場，對密集於地上之敵大型機二十四架，作低空掃射，其中五架起火，擊毀其十數架，復於布羅音激劇之空中戰，確實擊落P38型六架，擊毀數架，日方亦有二架犧牲。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　據雷伊泰島前綫日本從軍記者報告稱：記者跟隨之大部隊，自由奧爾莫克登陸後，即自奧爾莫克開始北上，是時雷伊泰島一帶。適值狂風暴雨，日軍不顧一切困難，繼續北進，目的地漸近，與敵軍之距離亦愈小，前衛部隊爲防範意料中之敵人出現，亦即開始警戒，如此跋涉山險，穿越密林之行軍，恐唯有日軍能完成其任務。吾人渡過數日之艱苦，行軍到達某高地，雖肉體不勝其疲勞，仍毫無休假，繼續準備戰鬥，漸次山險消滅，自某高地且能眺望卡里加拉灣一帶低地。美軍作戰地帶，因連日暴風雨交加，已成爲大泥坑，卡里加拉灣宛如一大泥海，尤令人吃驚。泥海之中，美軍第二十四師團之往來活動，亦可分明，望見美軍戰車到和上爲泥濘淹沒，或停於　出水面之小丘上，彼等目下前進旣不可能，後退又不可得，情狀極爲慘慘。美軍運輸部隊亦同樣束　手無策，且以此惡劣天氣，究何時放睛，不得而知，故美軍飢餓交迫，僅爲時間問題而已。日軍現已抵某地，而美軍猶未發覺，嗣忽聞轟然作　，望高空發見敵機正悠悠迥旋，不久即有類似炸彈之特陸續投下，近前看時，始判明係食糧品，美機誤以日軍方美軍也。日軍現與後方連絡，已完全成功，食糧接濟，即可源源而來，兵士等正怒髮衝冠，準備殺敵。</p>

<h3>南匯縣的敎育槪况</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>現在社會上的一般人，提到「敎育」，總會聯想到一個「窮」字，好像服務於敎育界的人們，前生命裏注定，和「窮」結下了不解緣似的。記者本身，前此也曾在敎育界服務，彼時每於社交的場合中，與人通款寒暄，說到已身的職業是個「敎書匠」時，對方總常常似乎有總帶着三分譏笑的意味，免不了要恭維這麼兩句「敎育界是秀淸高，但也非常淸苦」，當時眞說得你啼笑皆非。然而事實上，環顧全國的敎育界幾時脫離過一個「窘」字的範圍，而服務於敎育界的人士，又有幾個在經濟方面不提襟見肘，而生活能有一日之安定呢。所以在記者，尙沒有談到南匯的敎育槪況之前，可以簡單的向讀者諸君奉告一言。就是南匯的敎育界，也是掙扎在「窮困」環境裏的一羣。</p>
<p>在民國二十六的，南滙全縣計有初中兩所，各鉅均設有完全小學，鄕村則有初小，敎育頗爲發達，眞是「校區密邇，　歌相聞」，總計不下三百餘校。至於社會敎育方面，當時除城廂鐘，設有規模可觀之圖書館，及全育場外，而每一　行政分區，各設民衆敎育館一所，又每個小學，則分別辦理民衆學樣，推行社會敎育，不遺餘力，成績頗著，欣欣向榮之景況，堪稱空前。但好景不常，迨至事變發生，戰神的魔手把南匯的一枝含苞初放的敎育之花，幾至摧殘無餘。</p>
<p>最近南匯敎育狀況</p>
<p>戰後初期，當時僅存區立小學十餘所，經本縣敎育人士的不斷努力，現金縣共計有市立第五中學一。及縣立簡易師範一，初級中學二，完全小學二十三，初級小學一百四十七，總計中學男敎員二五，女敎員一，中學男生一五三，女士六三，小學男敎員三六七，女敎員一八六，小學男生一四九七九，女生三九八八人，合計高級四十六級，初級三六六級，如此成績，雖距理想尙遠，但亦　强人意矣。至私立之中小學各區林立，漫無統計，泰半皆不合規定，影響一般子弟之前程實大。考其設立原因，多數爲特殊勢力所把持，或爲投機性質，謀利爲目標，槪不明了敎育使命，行政當局，限於人力與財力不足，無法統歸縣立，致祇得任期自生自滅，實屬遺憾耳。</p>
<p>目前南匯敎育的行政機構，係按照戰前陳規，將八個行政分區，劃成五個學區。乃以一八分區併爲第一學區，二三分區併爲每二學區，第七分區爲第三學區，四五分開區併爲第四學區，第六分區爲第五學區，縣政府除依照奉頒人事標準，設置督學二人外，視察實際需要，每學區增設視導員一人，秉承縣府意旨，辦理各學區督導敎育事宜，組織頗爲完善。但礙於環境及經濟力，不能臻至完善之地步，殊感失望。</p>
<p>敎育經費之來源</p>
<p>南匯縣之敎育經費，迄今未獨立，致常被拖欠數月，司空見慣，不足爲奇，而影響薪金微薄之敎職生活至　，前此曾於附加　上，附微敎育費一角，但以種　原因，無異杯水車薪，於事無濟。後又創敎育特區，成績事後亦難若預期之理想。目前中學則每學期音收學米二斗，多級小學，最近收學米分四五六升三種，單級三升半。</p>
<p>簡易師範，目今共計男女學生五十人，一年畢業，其費用除收　費三百五十元，保證金五百元，賠償準備金三百元外，學宿費由八個分區公所共同分擔八十八担食米，法至良善。然據記者所知，各區類皆臨時推託，或遷延時日，決無軍警米之「有求必應」也。</p>
<p>按南匯向有敎充公產，計有學田一萬餘畝，本可收租金百餘萬元（三十三年之統計），事實上祇能收到五十餘萬元，戰前由縣敎育局徴收，彌補敎育費之不足，戰後此款十九移作別用，客歲該款用諸敎育方面者祇五萬元，此項公產雖名學田，南匯沿海各鄕，遭重大風災，學校房屋，受害至巨，各校紛紛呈請求濟，然當局置若罔聞，並未將學田所收之款，用諸救濟嗷嗷待哺之敎育界人員。</p>
<p>記者日參觀之學校，十九簡匯不堪，一室數用，而校具除市立五中略具規模外，其餘鄕間之學校，大都租用民間八仙桌與板橙充作課桌課椅，甚至以門板充作黑板，簡陋之慘狀，形同私墊，運動器具，更無從談起。</p>
<p>至於敎師之待遇，中學千餘元，小學則僅六百元，依照現時之物價，此些微之薪金，個人亦無法維持，　論有家室之累者，故致敎師中有辦法者皆紛紛改行，另謀出路，而現今之敎師，類幽泉發地人士，不乏濫竽充數者流，師資至差，影響兒童學業，至深且鉅。言念及此，不禁令人爲中國敎育前途悲。</p>
<p>獨占鰲頭的市立五中</p>
<p>雖說南匯的敎育。是在千瘡百孔凄涼的境況中，但吾人亦有能少以自慰者，即鶴立羣的五中，在窮困的環境中，十二位智識份子，站在敎育界本位上努力，尤其校長張水江氏以敎育後進爲天職，敎導主任陶學侃氏之埋頭苦幹精神，令人敬佩。最難可貴者爲全縣唯一數理科之中學女敎員陳曼靑女士，與陶君同係大同大學畢業生，據張校長語記者，陳女士家庭係本縣祝家橋首富，本可在家過其安逸舒適的「千金小姐」生活，無須出外謀事，但陳女士抱負至大，熱心敎育，願在此窮鄕僻壞的小城如南匯者，努力敎導一般靑年，實令人欽佩之至。記者於上月念六日，承該校張校長之約，赴五中講演，事後往各敎室參觀，內容至爲整潔，校舍處南匯西城城麗，環境幽美，頗合理想，前途發展希望甚大。</p>
<p>一得管見借貸諸當局</p>
<p>目今中國敎育問題，當前重要的課題，若以南匯爲例，似應該做到下列數點：</p>
<p>（一）提高一般敎職員之待遇　庶幾生活安定後，效率自能增加，否則寅吃卯糧，枵腹從公，欲其盡瘁敎育，不啻緣木求魚。</p>
<p>（二）敎育費務求獨立　不致時常被拖欠，影響敎師之生活，大可於田賦項下，附征敎育經費數成，劃歸縣府支配，由縣府主管科，另組保管委員會，負責保管及支配，按月撥款，不致重　前轍，俾利敎育行政之推行。</p>
<p>（三）整理敎育公產　縣政府應委派專員，負責切實整理學田，務使涓滴歸公，敎育公產項下之收入，用之於敎育事業上，方符敎育公產之原意</p>
<p>（四）師資之　別與培養　按敎師之良　，影響兒童學業之鉅，已如前言，故必須嚴加甄別，傳優良者，可儘先任用，劣者逐步淘汰，或施以短期之訓練，以臻完善。</p>
<p>（五）籌設的款　廣置校具，及運動設備。西諺有云：「當讓書時宜讀書，當遊戲時宜遊戲。」況小學一般天眞活潑的小天使，生性艱動，更宜課後多加活動，俾能練成强健的身心，使成未來國家的棟樑，一洗東亞病夫之恥名。</p>
<p>（六）普設義務學校　當此農村日趨衰敗，經濟凋敝之秋，而鄕村之小學學生，十九農民子弟，爲減輕農人之負担，與消滅文盲起見，似應努力推行義務學校，庶幾將來農民之知識程度普遍提高，即對復興農村上，亦有莫大之裨益也。</p>

<h3>德國萬眾一心　各盡全力保衛祖國　德大使館武官哈敏治發表談話</h3>
<p>本月十日德國駐華大使韋爾曼在南京招待中外新聞記者，席問由德大使館助理武官哈敏治上尉發表談話，原詞略謂：</p>
<p>本人離開德國爲時不久，故到達此間以後，有人探問家鄉種種的情形，德國人民今天的情形，是不像戰爭開始一二年那樣與奮，這是一種經過長期戰爭的自然現象。但另一方面，更有其他不同之處，就是一種堅決的決心，無論遭遇如何困難，絲毫沒有怨言，情甘忍受，即使最大的犧牲，亦堅持到底。我們的敵人對於戰爭目的，已經明白的宣佈，每一個德國人都曉得戰敗投降，就是德國的末日。我們旣然知道這一點，所以我們將內裏的力量，完全拿出來，用在戰事上。雖然我們每一個人的担負都是很重，仍是不避一切，堅持到底。在今日的情形，每一個德國人都是完全爲戰事盡力，各人盡各人的力量，保護祖國，無所謂前方後方，德國全國是一個戰綫。</p>
<p>在這幾年戰事的演進，除前綫的負担加重之外，後方亦因之而緊張，敵人時常猛烈的轟炸，要想將人民的戰鬥精神破壞打倒，在德國全部至今沒有一處達到他們的目的，這是不必談的。德國的軍人在前方如何的奮鬥，後方的人民亦如何應付敵人的肓目轟炸，萬衆一心，無分彼此，我爲人人，人人爲我。</p>
<p>防空訓練週密</p>
<p>本人今年春間在柏林及德國中部，曾親見敵人之猛烈空襲，所以對於每個同胞的努力與精神，有深切的認識。德國人民對於空戰的危險，經過相當的敎導及有系統的若千次晝夜防空訓練，所以對於恐怖轟炸的防空，均有準備。在各城市中，所有地窖的墻壁用石墻加厚，或爲該住戶等另用鋼骨水泥建築防空室。此外，在地平上下還有防空堡的設備，在地下者往往有三四層，在地平以上的有五層。在緊急警報的時候，人民均前往躱避。</p>
<p>空襲後救護，極其迅速，被炸的人，可以領到特別執照，連同若干補充配給證，可收買到各樣生活上必需的東西。在沒有調查正確損失以前，得在地方機關預借現款，在轟炸之後，人民一般情感的熱烈達於極點，眞爲本人向來沒有見過。凡每一個人都頤將他所僅有東西無條件贈與被難同胞。</p>
<p>科學建設猛進</p>
<p>德國科學的建設，是以德國火學爲基礎，在戰爭期間也是用種種方法，照舊進行，雖然德國大學以及其他敎育機關，有受戰事影響的地方，但是仍舊用適當方法照舊辦理，各種科學的研究仍然繼續不斷，德國之有新兵器出現，就可以證明。</p>
<p>自本人今年四月問出國之後，戰事局勢較爲緊張，殊有全國人民總動員的必要，因此無論何人所有的力量，至今尚未直接用到戰事方面的，現在都要直接參加，所有無關於決戰的事業，槪行停止，所有戲院電影音樂會等等一槪停止。</p>
<p>但是所謂全國總動員，並非所謂將文化方面完全取消，不再求其進步的意思。我們只須在任何的晚上，聽聽德國的廣播節目，就可以知道的即德國的報章與雜誌之類，雖有限制，然內容仍極豐富。</p>
<p>平時用品的製造、一槪停止，所有生活必需品均有標準，故製造極其容易，而且簡單。最重要的就是軍需品的製造，每一個德國人莫不澈底瞭解都具有一種鐵的志願，盡他所有的力量，保衛德國。</p>
<h3>松島部長　談菲島戰事　及敵美制霸世界野心</h3>
<p>日本　隊報導部松島部長，昨（十七日）下午兩時，在海軍武官府，循例招待中國記者團，發表談話。茲將所談要點，摘錄於后：</p>
<p>呂宋島東敵艦蠢動</p>
<p>敵美夏孟少將率領之機動部隊，現似在呂宋島東海面蠢動中，在此部隊內，有航空母艦十數隻，分三個集團行動，配備較前已低落不少。因敵艦時遭過慘敗之故，在未攻擊前，已先謀退略。日海陸航空部隊，月前雖在搜索殲滅敵艦之中，但因氣候不良之故，尚未獲得決定戰果。</p>
<p>雷伊泰島敵被包圍</p>
<p>在雷伊泰登陸之敵陸上部隊，被日軍攻擊，益趨激烈，從卡里加拉至奧亞摩兄之通路上，日軍作戰尤爲英勇，現日軍業將奧亞摩克公路上之敵切斷，並予以包國殲滅。敵方一再宣傳在該方面作戰勝利，但觀乎敵美陸軍次長巴特生所發表之談話，即可斷定其所稱勝利，全屬錯誤。巴特生於本月十六日稱：日本海軍現依然給予吾人重大威脅，空軍亦漸增其攻擊力，陸軍戰力發展程度，更爲應大，縱德國戰敗，日本亦將繼續戰鬥云云。</p>
<p>大陸敵機係神經戰</p>
<p>菲律賓作戰之主動權已操在日手，敵在此方面一籌莫展，乃轉而發動大陸空襲神經戰。今日（十七日）敵機Ｂ２９型數架，在江北沿岸及大通方面偵察，敵機不在菲戰塲作戰，而轉向京滬及長江沿岸活動，足以證明其避重就輕，無戰鬥力。</p>
<p>敵美野心制霸世界</p>
<p>據本月十五日路透社紐約電稱：羅斯福爲欲制霸世界，彼有三大野心：即（一）將使美國海軍力量超過世界海軍量，（二）美國須保有世界最大之商船隊，（三）美國將有遮蔽全地球之商業航路網。敵美此種誇大狂，殊値得吾人矚目。</p>
<p>納爾遜來毀減中國</p>
<p>進前軍火生產局長納爾遜，近方率領大批工作人員，再度赴重慶。在其工作人員中，有五人係製鐵專家，一人係製酒精專家。晉人對此應予注意者，即納爾遜此來，並非爲建設中國，而係在中國製造軍火，毀滅中國，此外並擬謀壟斷中國政治經濟權。上次英國某評論家嘗謂：「中國在戰前與職後，將成爲一無所有之國家。」納爾遜來華之計劃如成功，該評論家之言。即不幸而中矣。</p>
<p>英國對美亦示不滿</p>
<p>關於中國問題，英國對美國之結優，亦表示不滿，本月十五日英外務次官勞氏曾發表談話謂：「英國對中國之現狀，現殊無討論問題，將來中國問題，實爲美國各問題中之一部份」等語，觀此可知英對美之不滿矣。即以渝美關係而論，近亦日向不協調之途進展，渝美之交換宣傳，除以日本爲宣傳資料外，並無其他題材可藉。本月十五日重慶美聯社特派員向紐約發電謂：「日本現已承認戰敗，爲了未來計劃，特在菲律賓作持久戰。」此種不知所云之宣傳，旣未明瞭事實，又未顧及現狀，笨拙之至，殊屬可哂。</p>

<h3>對於敎職員發薪及　領配米問題之商榷</h3>
<p>— 王修和</p>
<p>閱十月二十八日本報，獲見有關敎育之紀載三則。筆者不敏，顧對此與我敎界同仁有切身關係之事，略抒所見，就正高明！</p>
<p>其一，爲戴敎育局長答記者之問，謂改善敎職員工待過，已有具體結果，（增加原有新工—七三〇元的百分之二百。）雖是物價上漲之速，非增加之數所能追上，然市政曁敎育當局對敎育工作人員之關垂，亦於此可見。其給予敎育工作人員精神上之　安，實在是非常可貴的。</p>
<p>其次，爲請學校當局「在開學時將一學期中敎職員工薪餉，全數發給，由敎職員工自行先事安排半年中生活需要」一事。這個辦法，在原則上是無可疵議的，不過我們放眼看看事實的話，在道目前一切未能盡如人意的情况下，尤其私立學校，恐怕一下十難於辦到罷。因爲一個敎師，自學期開始到學期結束，是否沒有變動？這是一個問題；變動而所發薪水中多取　分龍否悉數　還？又是一　問題；即使能够悉數　還而以其所還之數—此數不能如其方領時之能換取傳量物品去另行物色一個接替者是否能適得其人？又是一個問題。這幾個問題不能得到適當解決，則出錢之兒童，必將蒙受重大之損失。故依筆者一得之愚見，認爲比較妥善的辦法一，還是在收得學費之後，即由校長召集全校敎師，依照敎育局規定之學費分配原則，共同確定各敎師本學期每人應得薪金總額，把六分之一先發規款外，其餘六分之五躉購食米，存儲校中，每至月終，不以價論，而以量計，分發各人，如此，不管米價　　，敎師每月所領之量，總是一機，即使有敎師中途離校者，繼任人不致蒙受損失，而學校行政上，亦不致發生困難。茲以本校（市立飛虹小學）之事實來作例證，如下：本校於本學期開始，經第一次校務會議之決議，除每人先發一萬二千元（約當每人一學期應得學費部分之三分之二光景）作安家之費外，其餘均交膳食委員會講備柴米，以供日常應用。故目下米價每石雖越二萬元大關，柴價每担亦扣二千關之際，而本校十月份膳食，每客（一日三餐）不過七百元光景，（九月份爲六百零八元）。敎師雖宵肝辛勤，從未有一人稍靈倦容的。因此，我感覺到，各校當局如能與各敎師相見以　，那末我想薪水的發放問題，不難獲得適當解決的。</p>
<p>其三，爲敎職員工特種配給米之併次領取問題，這件事，在行政手續上，也許尚有未便之處、因得有額外配給米者，非僅限於敎職員工而已。關於此事之處置辦法，再以本校爲例：本校於十月十九日領得聯票後，爲免得各敎師往來跋涉及節省車資，經濟時間起見，由本人與敎師代表一人，（該代表由晨談會中推定——晨談會係本校全體敎職員集會之一，於每日晨八時二十分舉行，藉以檢討昨日工作經過，並計劃本日工作進程。）各騎自由車同往公賣處付款（款山校暫勢至月底扣算）取貨，運回校中，平均分發。已領二期，敎師們並未感受如一羣苦敎師所述之苦。但不知此法能供各校參攷否？</p>
<p>總之，敎育是樹人大計，我們的生活儘管是淸苦，但責任是挺重大的。一般短視的人，也許把我們遞批執粉筆的朋友，看做旣塞　而庸碌的傻瓜，但我們有自己的信念，有自己的理想。武訓儘是讓人呌他呌化子，但並不能滅低他興學的熱心。還望我敎界同仁，大家捧出一顆赤心，推廣　相與的來共爲兒童努力。則　家民族前途，庶有豸矣。（稿酬移助學金）</p>

<p>慈善爲懷</p>
<p>董方建德君，斐於上海一隅，孤苦老弱，受飢寒交迫，無以爲生，亟待救濟者，比比皆是，爰斥其私蓄壹萬元，分捐本處濟貧金·小學敎師醫藥助金·小本貸金·苦兒助金。醫藥助金·產婦助金，六項各壹仟元。又以天氣漸寒，嚴冬將屆，貧民餐風宿露，痛古更不堪言，慨捐冬賑經費四仠元，以爲響應。又有吳杭本德及朱阿琪兩君，或獨捐苦兒助金，或分捐本處各項助金，胥屬熱心公益，慈善爲懷，彌足感佩。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Capture Yishan, Directly Threatening Guiyang; The War in Guangxi Enters its Final Stage</h3>
<p>Guilin, 17th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese troops captured Guilin and Liuzhou, they launched a new campaign along the Guizhou-Guangxi Road and occupied Yishan on the 14th. The Japanese troops who captured Yishan continued to advance rapidly along the Guizhou-Guangxi Road, crossing the mountainous terrain of the Guangxi provincial border and entering the Guizhou province, thus directly threatening the Chongqing army's lifeline to India, cutting off Chongqing's lifeblood from the side. Yishan is located in the Longjiang Strait and is a strategic point for entering the mountainous area of Guizhou from the plains of Guangxi, less than 100 kilometers from Liuzhou, serving as the gateway to Guizhou Province. With the fall of Yishan, Guiyang, the last defense stronghold of the southwestern Chongqing army, is also directly threatened. Furthermore, due to the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, the withdrawal of the U.S. air force base and various military and political organs and military supplies stationed in Chongqing are concentrated in Guiyang, so Guiyang has now been transformed into a military city, and its crisis is becoming increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing recently made the following observations on the future actions of the Japanese troops in Guangxi: Since the Japanese troops have captured the two central cities of Guangxi Province, the war in Guangxi has entered its final stage. There are three possibilities for the current movements of the Japanese troops: (1) The Japanese troops will advance rapidly towards Guizhou. (2) Before continuing the attack, they will first consolidate the areas they have already occupied. (3) They will temporarily halt offensive operations near the border of Guizhou Province. The Japanese troops have entered Guangxi more than once. In the past, they have entered the southern part of Guangxi twice, and then retreated. However, this time the Japanese troops seem to intend to continue to maintain Changsha, Hengyang, and various key points in Guangxi.</p>
<p>Chinese People Cooperate with the Japanese Army</p>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese army on the front line in Guangxi, 17th (Central News Agency) - When the Japanese army broke through the Guangxi-Hunan provincial border and began to launch an offensive operation against the Fourth War Zone of Chongqing, the people of Guangxi Province worked hard to organize self-defense corps and national armies to carry out guerrilla warfare. However, as the Japanese army's operations progressed, military discipline was strict, and the supreme commander of the China Expeditionary Army issued a proclamation, they clearly understood the true meaning of the Japanese army's operations. Therefore, these organized self-defense corps and national armies gradually disarmed, surrendered, and then organized public security maintenance associations to provide active cooperation. What is particularly noteworthy is the direct cooperation of the residents with the Japanese army. The rapid units of the Japanese army, before starting their operations near a certain place and occupying Yishan, found their advance route through a very steep mountainous area, and due to continuous heavy rains, the roads were muddy, causing the horses transporting weapons, ammunition, and fodder to be continuously trapped in ditches. This was an unprecedentedly difficult march. However, after witnessing this situation, the public security maintenance associations in various places reported to the Japanese army authorities, willing to cooperate with the Japanese army in transporting fuel, ammunition, and food. At the same time, the farmers nearby also brought their sticks and baskets to cooperate with the Japanese army. On that day, the Japanese army and the Chinese people became one and started marching on the muddy roads, and finally managed to break through several kilometers of bad roads. As for the fuel, ammunition, and food, they were all carried by the Chinese people, and the Chongqing U.S. air force bases in Liuzhou, Liucheng, Yishan, and other places were subsequently captured by the rapid units of the Japanese army.</p>

<p>(4) Corruption and dereliction of duty are malignant bacteria that corrode politics, and hoarding and speculation are foolish insects that poison democracy.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Civil Servants Exempted from Military Service, Arousing Public Opposition</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) - Recently, Chongqing's broadcasts and newspapers have been vigorously promoting military service for students and intellectuals for days. The Chongqing authorities have also successively issued statements, strongly stating the crisis of the War of Resistance, in order to achieve the goal of mobilizing young people. In addition, compulsory conscription has begun in various places, but so far it has had no effect, and the recruitment of militia groups has been met with deep opposition from young people due to the exemption methods for recruitment by various agencies and organizations. Recently, the Shaoguan Daily published an editorial on this topic, stating that civil servants should not only not be exempted from military service, but should also take the lead in joining the army as a model for young people. This is a major attack on the unfair measures of the Chongqing military authorities.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei – Part 3</h3>
<p>[Author's Note]: Di Lan Qi Cheng Yitan said: "In the past, everyone who talked about revolution talked about Mr. Wang. Now, everyone who talks about governance talks about Mr. Wang. Thus, Mr. Wang has not failed to live up to the expectations of the country." Mr. Wang's courtesy name was Jingwei. He was from Shanyin, Zhejiang. His father, a certain Mr. Wang, served as a traveling secretary in Guangdong and lived in Panyu, thus being registered there. He was intelligent from a young age, possessed great ambitions, and loved to read, remembering everything he saw. He studied in Japan in his youth and met Mr. Sun Yat-sen in Tokyo. Mr. Sun appreciated his talent and often consulted him in secret about the matter of overthrowing the Manchus and restoring the Han. Mr. Wang said: "The Qing government has been corrupt for a long time. Now, a three-year-old child is emperor. What are we waiting for before it collapses?" Mr. Sun agreed with him. He then joined the Tongmenghui and worked with Zhang Taiyan (Binglin) to write for the Minbao, severely criticizing the shortcomings of the Qing government in articles that often ran to several thousand words. In the late years of the Xuantong era, he and Huang Fusheng (Shuzhong) went to Beiping and rented a house to live in, pretending to be merchants and not leaving the house. The two secretly buried landmines, planning to assassinate Prince Regent Zaifeng. The matter was revealed and they were imprisoned in the Ministry of Justice. Tingjie, the Minister of Justice, proposed the death penalty. Prince Su Shanqi, who was in charge of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, strongly opposed it, saying that revolutionary parties were spreading across the country and could erupt at any moment. Mr. Wang was a scholar and could not do anything. It would be better to imprison him for a long time and slowly interrogate him about the secret plans of his party. Even if we cannot obtain everything, getting half or one or two would be enough for precautions. Tingjie was moved and agreed. Shanqi told Tingjie, who told Zaifeng, and Zaifeng also agreed. Mr. Wang was spared death. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he was released from prison and learned that Yuan Shikai controlled the military seals. He was about to be appointed, so he arranged for his son, Keding, to accompany him to Huan Shang to meet Shikai, providing him with great righteousness and moving him with public opinion, urging him to depose the young emperor, overthrow the Qing court, and build a democratic republic. This was the time. Shikai was moved by his sincerity and revealed his hidden feelings. Mr. Wang then went south, returned, and participated in the North-South peace talks. When the Provisional Government was established in Nanjing, Mr. Wang declared that he would not be an official or a member of parliament and organized the Six No's Society with six non-binding rules. At that time, the people of Guangdong Province were recommending him as the governor of Guangdong, and the government was also about to make great use of him. After the Provisional Senate appointed Shikai as the Provisional President at Mr. Sun's word, Mr. Sun immediately sent Mr. Wang and Cai Yuanpei to welcome him. Shikai was worried about changes and afraid to go south, so he secretly instructed his trusted third regiment, led by Cao Kun, to riot and loot Beijing and Tianjin, using the excuse that no one was stationed in the north and the head of state should postpone his trip and the government should be elected in the north. The various processes in between are known to everyone and will not be repeated. When Shikai was elected as the Provisional President, Mr. Wang contributed greatly. Otherwise, the North and South would have been at war for a long time, the abdication of the Qing Emperor would have been indefinite, and the situation of unification would have been impossible to establish. After Shikai's death, the strength of the Northern Army gradually declined, year after year, until it collapsed. In recent years, Mr. Wang joined the Party-State government, but then resigned due to political disagreements. He liked to write political commentaries, especially to talk about legal principles, and wrote in vernacular style. However, his collections were published, and he occasionally wrote poetry. His poetry was also guarded and resembled his people.</p>
<p>Qiu Wu Ye Tan said: "When Liao Zhongkai was assassinated, Mr. Wang went to the hospital to see him. Seeing that he had passed away, he repeatedly shook his head in sadness and personally wrote a message to his comrades, which was posted at the Central Party Headquarters. At that time, the Party Headquarters was still in the Huizhou Guild Hall. The next day, all the party members saw it and copied it one after another. There was a striking sentence that said: 'Those who do not make revolution, go to the right. Those who make revolution, go to the left.' The origin of the Left faction really began here." In the early years of the Republic of China, Mr. Wang often went to friends' houses to discuss matters on the second floor of a certain house on Dongheng Street in Guangzhou. Wine was placed against the railing. The railing was rotten and cracked, and a person fell from the third floor, but luckily, he fell to the ground without injury, but it was still dangerous.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Realize Chairman Wang's Last Wishes</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday, I accepted the invitation of the city's propaganda office to give a radio speech on how to realize Chairman Wang's last wishes. Now, I am reprinting the speech here.</p>
<p>It has been a week since the passing of Chairman Wang Jingwei of the National Government. The mourning expressed by all parties over the past week is enough to comfort Mr. Wang's spirit in heaven.</p>
<p>First, the unanimous expression of solemn respect for Mr. Wang by officials and civilians across the country, as well as people from allied nations, proves that Mr. Wang's great personality and spirit for the country and for East Asia have won the love of all parties at home and abroad. Although the body is dead, the spirit is truly immortal.</p>
<p>Second, the entire country maintains extreme calmness in mourning. Both central government affairs and all levels of society are as stable as usual. Not only is there no anxiety, but there is also a determination to work even harder and inherit his legacy. The achievement of peace and the victory of the war are fully guaranteed here.</p>
<p>Third, Mr. Chen Gongbo has been designated by the central government as Mr. Wang’s successor. Mr. Chen is also an advanced member of the party and nation, with outstanding talent, and has shared hardships with Mr. Wang for a long time, knowing him best. This time, taking on a difficult task, he will surely draw on his past experience in politics and his fair attitude to complete the unfinished will of Mr. Wang.</p>
<p>Fourth, after the passing of Mr. Wang, the authorities of allied nations have formally stated that their policy towards China will not change. They will continue to provide their greatest cooperation, strengthen close relations between the two countries, and work together to win the Greater East Asia War. This is also the guarantee for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>However, we cannot be satisfied with maintaining the status quo. On the contrary, we should work harder and redouble our efforts after Mr. Wang's passing. First of all, we hope that the government authorities will thoroughly reform politics, eliminate corrupt officials, and establish expert politics.</p>
<p>We have consistently advocated reforming politics and establishing expert politics in the past. Therefore, all future government measures must be in line with this principle. First, be selfless and impartial, abandon partisan ideas, select people for positions based on their abilities, and ensure that talent matches the job. Second, identify and promote talented people who are not in government, because honest and capable people outside the government often suffer from having nothing to do, resulting in being buried and wasted. The government should carefully seek them out and give them opportunities to serve, so that no talent is left out in the field. Third, rewards and punishments should be clear. Officials in the government who have poor performance should be dismissed and punished without any leniency, in order to achieve the effect of cleaning up officialdom and clarifying politics.</p>
<p>Secondly, improve the administrative organs and make reasonable adjustments. For example, organizations with unclear responsibilities, redundant layers, or nothing to do should be merged or abolished. This will not only eliminate many meaningless bureaucratic formalities and unnecessary restrictions, but also use the saved funds to strengthen the functioning organs. Only when politics is on the right track can the implementation of national policies be effective.</p>
<p>Again, at this stage of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War, we must strengthen our belief in winning the war, and especially mobilize the power of the people to devote themselves to the war. Therefore, we must first improve the people's livelihood. Currently, the people suffer most from two things: the failure to establish public security and the continuous rise in prices. Establishing public security should start with improving the treatment of the military and police. Suppressing prices should start with preventing profiteering.</p>
<p>Our mourning for Chairman Wang cannot be merely expressed in words or writing. We must be down-to-earth, work hard in practical action, and jointly realize Chairman Wang's legacy. This is the way to express our sorrow.</p>

<p>Purpose of This Visit to Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Representative Ba Maw met with reporters at the reception hall on the afternoon of the 16th and issued the following statement: "I am extremely honored and grateful to have been received by His Majesty the Emperor in my capacity as a representative of the nation of Burma. His Majesty the Emperor inquired about various matters concerning our people. We will always remember the realization of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the glory of today, and we will never forget it. " He added: "The first purpose of my visit to Japan is to discuss various common issues between Japan and Burma. Needless to say, these issues are related to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, I would also like to personally witness the details of the Japanese people's resolute struggle under the war situation. I have long known about the news of the Japanese people's total mobilization, but I would especially like to know the details of how the total mobilization was completed, especially in the spiritual aspect, and how the 'Kamikaze Special Attack Force' was created. In addition, in order to enable Burma to receive further assistance from Japan, I would like to take this opportunity to visit my friends and acquaintances in Japan. At the same time, I hope that the people of Japan and Burma will work more closely together in the future to thoroughly complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<h3>One US Plane Intrudeed Over Kyushu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - One enemy B-29 type plane, on the 17th at approximately 10:00 AM, flew at a very high altitude from a Chongqing-based base, intruded into the western region of Kyushu, Japan. It did not drop any bombs, and at 12:00 PM, it fled back to its base via southern Korea.</p>
<h3>The Great Naval Battle East of the Philippines; Asahi Shimbun Reports the Actual Situation at the Time</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In this great naval and air battle east of the Philippines, the long-awaited Japanese Combined Fleet finally resolutely launched an attack, fiercely attacking over sixty enemy aircraft carriers and battleships in Leyte Gulf, displaying the power accumulated by the Japanese Navy throughout its history, and creating one of the greatest kamikaze battles in Japanese naval history. The Asahi Shimbun correspondent who was embedded with the troops recorded the situation at the time as follows:</p>
<p>The long-awaited attack order was finally issued. The excitement of the officers and soldiers of each ship on this day was indescribable. When receiving the standby order, each ship had already prepared for battle. In the afternoon, the flagship issued a signal for the captains of each ship to assemble, which was the beginning of the attack order. As the large mobile force marched south with high morale, it continued to perform the "one-character formation movement" in order to be wary of submarines. The next day, the weather was clear and bright, which was the most suitable weather for an attack. News of the enemy's actions near the Philippines gradually spread. Finally, it was reported that the enemy had launched a new landing operation near Leyte Gulf, and that the enemy's powerful mobile force was divided into several armies and was operating in the sea east of the Philippines. At this point, the unprecedented opportunity for battle had matured. All members received the captain's order to begin naval calisthenics. Soon, the fleet arrived east of a certain island, and the time for the decisive battle was approaching. According to a telegram, the enemy's mobile force, centered on the landing point in Leyte Gulf, was divided into several armies and was operating in the area east of the Philippines. Just before the start of this decisive battle, the staff room became tense. On that day, one Japanese reconnaissance plane discovered that the enemy's mobile force consisted of several aircraft carriers and several super aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. An attack order was immediately issued, and multiple joint formations of fighter-bombers took off from the aircraft carrier, divided into two groups, and broke into the battlefield. The second group overcame difficult conditions and flew high in the clouds, finally discovering the enemy's mobile force centered on several powerful aircraft carriers. They immediately launched a surprise attack, breaking through the enemy's fierce defensive fire, and concentrated their bombing on the large aircraft carriers. Multiple bombs hit the flight deck, followed by loud explosions. The ship tilted, and a large aircraft carrier also erupted in flames and sank one after another. The enemy's new aircraft carrier was completely destroyed. However, there were still super aircraft carriers, and the Japanese aircraft attack force immediately changed its target, but unexpectedly encountered an attack from the enemy's superior fighter groups and had to return to base. The other naval forces suddenly appeared in Leyte Gulf, attacking the enemy fleet in the bay. The enemy was caught off guard, and the fleet fell into a state of collapse. The Japanese fleet took the opportunity to bombard them with large-caliber guns. The results of the battle gradually expanded, with a total of more than sixty enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, etc. The Japanese fleet further broke into the enemy transport convoy and its escort fleet, engaging in close combat. At this time, enemy aircraft teams appeared in the sky and bombed five times. The Japanese flagship issued an order that the entire army would launch a do-or-die night raid to sink the enemy fleet. Then, they reorganized their formation to protect the main force with destroyers, without any disorder, and advanced in the darkness. Late at night, they encountered the enemy fleet. Cannons roared, and a magnificent close-quarters night raid began. After several minutes of fighting, the sea returned to silence. This time, at least one enemy cruiser was sunk. After the main force arrived, the enemy ships fled in a hurry to the south, and the Japanese fleet turned north. The naval battle in the Philippine Sea thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>Philippine Government Promulgates Compulsory Labor Order</h3>
<p>Manila, 17th (Central News Agency) - President Laurel promulgated a compulsory labor order on the 14th to enable the Philippine people to cooperate with the Japanese army's labor operations. General Li Mao-die also issued a statement on this matter, saying: "The enemy Americans rely on their abundant materials and have now landed in the Philippines. At present, the Philippines is facing an extraordinary situation, and the crisis is approaching the people. President Laurel has announced his participation in the war and explained the Philippines' position to the world. However, the Philippine nation has not yet implemented conscription to increase its strength to defend the motherland. Therefore, where is the Philippine people's participation in the war? The Japanese army, in order to defeat the enemy Americans and defend the Philippine defense line, not only makes the greatest sacrifices, but also bears most of the responsibility for labor operations in various parts of the Philippines. All of us Filipinos should emulate the spirit of sacrifice of the Japanese army and strive to engage in labor operations to reduce the burden on the Japanese army and actively cooperate in completing the war. This is the duty of the Philippine people and the only way for us to cooperate in the war."</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle in Leyte, Japanese Aircraft Strongly Attack Enemy Base, Japanese Army Completes Mission in Storm</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – The war on Leyte Island is intensifying. The enemy is reinforcing the air force bases at Tacloban, Tarac, Burauen, and Sababro in an effort to seize air superiority. The Japanese air force has been attacking these bases and intercepting enemy aircraft daily. On the evening of the 16th, a Japanese warplane unit fiercely bombed the enemy airfield at Burauen, making low-altitude sweeps against 24 enemy large aircraft concentrated on the ground. Five of them caught fire and over ten were destroyed. In the fierce air battle over Burauen, six P-38s were certainly shot down and several were damaged. The Japanese side also suffered two losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from a Japanese war correspondent at the Leyte Island front, the large unit he accompanied landed freely at Ormoc and then began to move north from Ormoc. At that time, the Leyte Island area was experiencing fierce storms. The Japanese army disregarded all difficulties and continued to advance north. As the destination drew closer, the distance to the enemy also narrowed. The vanguard began to be vigilant to guard against the expected enemy appearance. Only the Japanese army could complete such a march through dangerous mountains and dense forests. After several days of arduous travel, we arrived at a certain high ground. Although physically exhausted, we continued to prepare for battle without rest. Gradually, the mountain hazards disappeared, and from a certain high ground, we could also see the lowlands around Carigara Bay. The American combat zone had become a large mud pit due to continuous storms, and Carigara Bay was like a large mud sea, which was particularly surprising. In the mud sea, the movements of the American 24th Infantry Division could also be clearly seen. American tanks were seen submerged in the mud or stopped on small hills emerging from the water. They could not advance or retreat, which was extremely miserable. The American transport units were also helpless, and it was unknown when this bad weather would clear, so the American army's hunger was only a matter of time. The Japanese army has now arrived at a certain place, but the Americans have not yet discovered it. Suddenly, a loud noise was heard, and enemy aircraft were seen slowly circling in the high sky. Soon, objects resembling bombs were dropped one after another. On closer inspection, it was determined that they were food supplies. The American aircraft mistook the Japanese army for the American army. The Japanese army's contact with the rear has been completely successful, and food supplies will be able to arrive continuously. The soldiers are enraged and ready to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from San Francisco stated that the headquarters of General MacArthur on Leyte Island announced on the 16th that Brigadier General Izlay, deputy commander of the US Army's 96th Division, was wounded in frontline combat on the night of the 15th.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Invited to Visit Paris</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency dispatch, according to news from Washington, stated that President Roosevelt has accepted General de Gaulle's invitation to visit Paris, but the date of the visit has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Spain Recognizes De Gaulle Government</h3>

<p>Intriguing French Attitude</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency report, according to news from Moscow, stated that News Daily commented on Thursday that France has diverging opinions on Britain's plan to establish a Western European group. France must not only consider both sides but also the East. After the war, France must cooperate closely with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) – A Reuters report stated that the German Foreign Ministry believes that Churchill was unable to persuade France to participate in the Western European group organization plan, either before or during his visit to Paris. Furthermore, de Gaulle invited Stalin to visit Paris, but Stalin refused, instead inviting de Gaulle to Moscow. German officials believe that Stalin's invitation to de Gaulle has political implications, as de Gaulle's visit to Moscow occurred after Churchill's visit to Paris and British newspapers began discussing the Western European group plan. The underlying meaning is intriguing. Some French people believe that Britain's plan to organize a Western European group has an anti-Soviet tendency.</p>

On the 15th, they shifted the focus of their attack northward, attacking the city of Aszalarocsa. Although the German army resisted strongly, the city was eventually captured by Soviet tanks. However, the German army also concentrated its forces to launch a counteroffensive that afternoon, and after a fierce tank battle, completely regained the northern part of Aszalarocsa. German troops continue to fight bravely in the Balkans and the Finnish-Norwegian border areas, overcoming various difficulties in terrain and weather.

<h3>An Overview of Education in Nanhui County</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>Nowadays, when people mention "education," they always associate it with the word "poor." It's as if those who serve in the education sector are destined to be inextricably linked with "poverty." As a journalist, I once served in the education sector. Back then, whenever I was at a social gathering and greeted people, mentioning that my profession was a "teacher," the other party would often seem to have a hint of mockery, inevitably offering two lines of flattery: "The education sector is noble and pure, but also very poor." At the time, it was truly a situation that left you not knowing whether to laugh or cry. However, in reality, when has the education sector nationwide ever escaped the confines of the word "distress"? And how many people serving in the education sector have not been struggling financially and able to have a day of stable life? Therefore, before I talk about the educational situation in Nanhui, I can simply tell the readers one thing: The education sector in Nanhui is also a group struggling in a "poor" environment.</p>
<p>In 1937, Nanhui County had two junior high schools, each with a complete primary school. In the villages, there were lower primary schools. Education was quite developed, truly "school districts were close, and singing could be heard from each other." In total, there were no fewer than 300 schools. As for social education, at that time, in addition to the library and sports field in the town, each administrative district had a public education center, and each primary school also ran a public school, sparing no effort to promote social education. The achievements were quite remarkable, and the flourishing scene was unprecedented. But good times don't last forever. With the outbreak of the incident, the devil's hand of war almost completely destroyed the budding flower of education in Nanhui.</p>
<p>Recent Education Status in Nanhui</p>
<p>In the early post-war period, there were only a dozen or so district-run primary schools remaining. Through the continuous efforts of educational personnel in the county, there is now the Municipal Fifth Middle School, one County Simplified Normal School, two junior middle schools, twenty-three complete primary schools, and one hundred and forty-seven junior primary schools. In total, there are 25 male middle school teachers, 1 female teacher, 153 male middle school students, 63 female students, 367 male primary school teachers, 186 female teachers, 14,979 male primary school students, and 3,988 female students, totaling 46 upper grades and 366 lower grades. Although this achievement is far from ideal, it is still quite gratifying. However, private primary and secondary schools are scattered in various districts, with no statistics available. Most of them do not meet the regulations, which greatly affects the future of the general children. Examining the reasons for their establishment, most of them are controlled by special forces or are speculative in nature, aiming for profit. They do not understand the mission of education. The administrative authorities are limited by insufficient manpower and financial resources and cannot integrate them into county-run schools, so they have to let them fend for themselves, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The current administrative structure of education in Nanhui is based on the old rules before the war, dividing the eight administrative districts into five school districts. Districts one and eight are combined into the first school district, districts two and three are combined into the second school district, district seven is the third school district, districts four and five are combined into the fourth school district, and district six is the fifth school district. In addition to setting up two supervisors in accordance with the promulgated personnel standards, the county government also increases the number of guides in each school district according to actual needs, carrying out the supervision of education in each school district in accordance with the county government's intentions. The organization is quite complete. However, due to environmental and economic limitations, it cannot reach perfection, which is disappointing.</p>
<p>Sources of Education Funding</p>
<p>The education funding in Nanhui County is still not independent to this day, so it is common to be in arrears for several months, which is not surprising, and it severely affects the lives of teachers with meager salaries. Previously, an additional one cent of education fee was added to the surtax, but due to various reasons, it was like a drop in the bucket and did not help. Later, a special education zone was created, but the results were difficult to achieve the expected ideal. Currently, middle schools collect two dou of rice per semester, and senior primary schools collect four, five, and six sheng of rice, and junior primary schools collect three and a half sheng.</p>
<p>The Simplified Normal School currently has a total of 50 male and female students, graduating in one year. In addition to collecting tuition of 350 yuan, a deposit of 500 yuan, and a compensation reserve of 300 yuan, the tuition and accommodation fees are jointly borne by the eight district offices with 88 dan of rice, which is a very good method. However, according to what I have learned, all districts are temporarily shirking responsibility or delaying the date, and there is no "guaranteed response" like military and police rice.</p>
<p>Nanhui has always had public properties dedicated to education, including over 10,000 mu of school land, which could generate over one million yuan in rent (according to 1944 statistics). In fact, only over 500,000 yuan can be collected. Before the war, this was collected by the County Education Bureau to make up for the shortage of education funds. After the war, 19 out of 10 of this fund was diverted for other uses. Last year, only 50,000 yuan of this fund was used for education. Although this public property is nominally school land, the coastal villages in Nanhui suffered severe wind disasters, and school buildings were severely damaged. The schools have been repeatedly requesting relief, but the authorities turned a blind eye and did not use the funds collected from the school land to provide relief to the starving education workers.</p>
<p>The schools I have visited are mostly dilapidated, with one room used for multiple purposes. Except for the slightly larger Municipal Fifth Middle School, the other rural schools mostly rent folk tables and benches as desks and chairs, and even use doors as blackboards. The poverty is so severe that they resemble private schools. Sports equipment is even out of the question.</p>
<p>As for the teachers' salaries, middle school teachers receive over 1,000 yuan, while primary school teachers receive only 600 yuan. According to current prices, this meager salary is not enough for individuals to maintain themselves, let alone those with families. Therefore, teachers with means are leaving the profession to seek other ways out. The current teachers are mostly people who are forced to do so, and there is no shortage of those who are incompetent and filling positions. The quality of teachers is so poor that it deeply affects the studies of children. Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel sad for the future of Chinese education.</p>
<p>Municipal Fifth Middle School, the leader of the pack</p>
<p>Although the education in Nanhui is in a situation of devastation and misery, we can still take some comfort in the fact that the Fifth Middle School stands out from the crowd. In a poor environment, twelve intellectuals are working hard from the perspective of the education sector. In particular, Principal Zhang Shuijiang takes educating future generations as his duty, and the hard work spirit of Director of Teaching Tao Xuekan is admirable. Most commendable is Ms. Chen Manqing, the only female teacher in the county who teaches mathematics and science. She and Tao are both graduates of Datong University. According to Principal Zhang, Ms. Chen's family is the wealthiest in Zhujiaqiao, Nanhui County. She could have lived a comfortable "golden lady" life at home without having to seek employment outside. However, Ms. Chen has great ambitions and is enthusiastic about education. She is willing to work hard to educate the general young people in a small, remote city like Nanhui, which is truly admirable. On the 26th of last month, I accepted Principal Zhang's invitation to give a lecture at the Fifth Middle School. Afterwards, I visited the classrooms and found them to be very clean. The school building is located in Xicheng, Nanhui, in a beautiful and quiet environment, which is quite ideal. The prospects for future development are very promising.</p>
<p>Humble opinions borrowed from the authorities</p>
<p>Currently, the important topics in Chinese education, taking Nanhui as an example, should be done as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the salaries of general teachers and staff. Only after their lives are stable can their efficiency increase. Otherwise, if they are living from hand to mouth and serving the public with an empty stomach, it would be like climbing a tree to catch fish if they are expected to devote themselves to education.</p>
<p>(2) Education funding should be independent to ensure that it is not often in arrears, affecting the lives of teachers. It is possible to add a certain percentage of education funds to the land tax, which should be allocated to the county government for management. The relevant departments of the county government should form a management committee to be responsible for safekeeping and allocation, allocating funds on a monthly basis to avoid repeating the same mistakes, which would be conducive to the promotion of educational administration.</p>
<p>(3) Reorganize public education properties. The county government should appoint special personnel to be responsible for the practical reorganization of school land, ensuring that every cent goes to the public and that the income from public education properties is used for education, which is in line with the original intention of public education properties.</p>
<p>(4) Selection and training of teachers. As mentioned earlier, the quality of teachers has a significant impact on children's learning. Therefore, strict selection must be carried out. Those with excellent skills can be given priority for employment, while the inferior ones should be gradually eliminated or given short-term training to achieve perfection.</p>
<p>(5) Raise funds to widely set up school supplies and sports equipment. As the Western saying goes, "When it's time to read, read; when it's time to play, play." Moreover, primary school students are generally innocent and lively little angels who are naturally active. They should be given more activities after class to develop strong minds and bodies, making them the pillars of the future country and wiping away the shame of being called the "sick men of East Asia."</p>
<p>(6) Universally establish compulsory schools. At a time when the countryside is declining and the economy is depressed, and most of the students in rural primary schools are children of farmers, in order to reduce the burden on farmers and eliminate illiteracy, it is necessary to vigorously promote compulsory schools, so that the level of knowledge of farmers will be generally improved in the future, which will also be of great benefit to the revitalization of the countryside.</p>

<h3>Inspect Warehouses to Eliminate Hoarding, Promote Economic Policies, Economic Security Office Hopes for Full Assistance from Citizens</h3>
<p>Tan, the director of the Economic Security Office of the Shanghai Special City Police Department, said: "The recent soaring prices in the city pose a great threat to people's livelihoods. The general public goes without saying, even those engaged in hoarding or obsessed with manipulating prices in the market hope that the authorities will take concrete measures to suppress prices. Under such circumstances, the relationship between materials and prices in the city has become a serious issue that cannot be ignored. The municipal authorities, in view of this, have implemented effective measures, issuing the "Provisional Measures for Investigating the Storage of Goods in Warehouses and Stockyards," to investigate the city's inventory of materials in order to establish a reasonable policy for the control of materials and prices. To promote the city government's policy, the Economic Security Office, based on the spirit of these measures, has been implementing inspections of various warehouses and stockyards since last month. This inspection targets the main commodities announced by the Economic Bureau, and other commodities that are considered hoardable are also included in the inspection. The office divides warehouses into two types, commercial warehouses and private warehouses, for inspection. Commercial warehouses refer to warehouses that are specifically used to store goods for general merchants on a consignment basis, while private warehouses refer to warehouses set up by stores and factories for their own use. In addition, individuals who store large quantities of goods in their own residences, offices, or other places are also treated as private warehouses. If private warehouses have not yet registered their stored goods, they should quickly apply for registration with the City Economic Bureau. Those who deliberately fail to register will be prosecuted for violating Article 28 of the Provisional Measures for Investigating the Storage of Goods in Warehouses and Stockyards. Inquiries regarding registration procedures can be made to the Economic Bureau. Fearing that various circles are not aware of this, we hereby warn them to comply to avoid violations. Furthermore, the purpose of this inspection is to thoroughly investigate the inventory of materials in order to smoothly promote economic policies. At the same time, it is to eliminate the hoarding behavior of merchants in order to eradicate the chronic problems of the city's economic circles. Therefore, the scope of the crackdown is extremely widespread. The general public should deeply understand the significance of the authorities' policies and provide full assistance to the inspection work. If illegal transactions or hoarding activities are discovered, they should be quickly reported to the Economic Security Office or the nearby Economic Police Team for investigation and prosecution. In accordance with the regulations, all informants will be given bonuses as a reward. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>Director Yuan Discusses Streamlining Municipal Tax Revenue: Streamlining Old Taxes and Levying New Taxes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Propaganda Department convened its 28th regular press conference at the Municipal Government conference room at 10:00 AM on the 17th. Director Yuan Houzhi of the Municipal Finance Bureau attended to answer various questions raised by reporters. The following is a record of the questions and answers:</p>
<p>Specific Contents of Tax Revenue Streamlining</p>
<p>(1) *Shen Bao* asked: It is said that the Advisory Committee and the Finance Bureau are discussing the streamlining of tax revenue. Can Director Zhu elaborate on the specific contents?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the streamlining of tax revenue, the Municipal Government, Finance Bureau, General Accounting Office, and Advisory Committee have formed a Municipal Tax Streamlining Committee to take charge of the matter. After careful deliberation on streamlining old taxes and levying new taxes, the following results have been achieved: (A) Streamlining Old Taxes: (1) The house tax in the eighteen districts previously collected 7 million yuan per month. After re-surveying and re-evaluating, it has increased to 9 million yuan per month, effective since the autumn of this year. (2) Consumption (Special) Tax: After streamlining, it is estimated that it can increase by 20 million yuan per month starting in October. The actual increase is 92 million yuan (Central Government and Municipal Government each receive half). (3) Nanshi Business Tax: Previously, the monthly revenue was over 200,000 yuan. After streamlining, it has increased by about 1 million yuan, effective since October. (4) The pig special tax is levied ad valorem, originally collecting 50 yuan per pig, with revenue of 1.8 million yuan. Now, starting from October 12, the assessed value will be increased, collecting 200 yuan per pig, which can increase by 5 million yuan per month. (5) Dance Ticket Tax: Previously, it was levied together with the banquet tax at a tax rate of 15%, with a monthly revenue of 2 million yuan (half of which went to the Municipal Government). Now, it has been incorporated into the entertainment tax, and the tax rate has been increased to 30%, with a monthly revenue increased to around 4 million yuan, all of which goes to the Municipal Government, effective since November 1. (6) Administrative revenue of the Public Utilities Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 2 million yuan per month, starting from January of the 34th year, and has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. (7) Administrative revenue of the Economic Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 1 million yuan per month, also submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. (8) Administrative revenue of the Public Works Bureau: After adjustment, it is expected to increase by 300,000 yuan per month, also pending approval from the Municipal Government. The tax revenue portion of the above streamlining of old taxes has been implemented, increasing by about 5.5 million yuan per month. The administrative revenue portion has not yet been implemented, and is expected to increase by about 3.3 million yuan. (B) Levying New Taxes: (1) The "02" telephone tax has started on November 1, and can collect 400,000 yuan per month. (2) Cattle Tax: Following the example of the pig special tax, it is levied ad valorem. It is estimated that 4,000 heads will be taxed each month, at 2,000 yuan per head, which can collect 8 million yuan per month, and has already started. (3) Poultry Tax: It has been implemented since November. The city's turnover is estimated at 10 million yuan, levied ad valorem at 5%, which can collect 5 million yuan per month. (4) Mahjong Entertainment Tax: It is scheduled to start on December 1, specifically collecting from brothels, courtesan houses, clubs, and hotels. After investigation and estimation, it can collect 30 million yuan per month, set at 3,000 yuan per table per month. This is the initial implementation, with a budgeted monthly revenue of 10 million yuan. The above old taxes can increase revenue by about 60 million yuan, and new taxes can collect more than 24 million yuan.</p>
<p>Improving Special Tax Collection Methods</p>
<p>(2) *New China Daily* asked: Regarding the special consumption tax case, apart from those who have been punished publicly, are the remaining parts still under investigation?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the special tax corruption case, the involved personnel have been convicted according to law. More than 2,000 other shops have been decided to be fined ten to twenty times the amount, which will be enforced by the police局.</p>
<p>(3) *Ping Bao* asked: What new developments will there be in the city's special tax collection methods in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: We are currently printing small invoices for shops to use, with uniform rates, and plan to specially print stamps. All shop ledgers must be stamped with this stamp to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>(4) Central News Agency asked: Judging from the current situation, the city's special tax collection agencies can be roughly divided into three major areas: the former first district, the former eighth district, and the old urban area. What unified plan does your bureau have for this?</p>
<p>Answer: The special tax in the former one or eight districts is handled by the Municipal Government on behalf of the tax office, while the old urban area is handled by the Tax Affairs Office. A unified plan is under study. The special tax collection in the former one or eight districts can be unified starting next year.</p>
<h3>Cotton Production Increase: Nine Meetings Held</h3>
<p>The ninth committee meeting of the General Association for Cotton Production Increase and the seventh council meeting of the Association for Cotton Development in the Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area were held simultaneously in the conference room of the Cotton Industry Building at 2:00 PM yesterday. In addition to reporting on the recent cotton development work in the Jiangbei area, it was decided after discussion to allocate the second application for development funds to various standing agencies, and to approve the resignation of council member Mr. Xiaochi.</p>
<h3>Special Rice Allocation for Teachers and Staff: Personnel Change Measures</h3>
<p>The special allocation of rice for teachers and staff of public and private schools in the city began last month. However, recently, a small number of schools have requested the return or issuance of additional rice allocation certificates due to personnel changes or duplicate allocations. It is understood that the Municipal Education Bureau, in order to facilitate the handling of such matters by the schools, has consulted with the Material Allocation Office and formulated the following handling methods: (1) Schools can directly return rice allocation certificates to the Material Allocation Office. (2) If the number of personnel is the same after personnel changes in schools, it is not necessary to notify the Material Allocation Office. (3) Schools that add staff or hire teachers should obtain application forms from the Material Allocation Office, submit them to the Education Bureau for review, and forward them to the Material Allocation Office.</p>

<h3>Germany United as One: Everyone Does Their Best to Defend the Motherland: Remarks by Colonel Harminge, Military Attaché of the German Embassy</h3>
<p>On the 10th of this month, German Ambassador to China Welman hosted Chinese and foreign journalists in Nanjing. During the meeting, Captain Harminge, Assistant Military Attaché of the German Embassy, delivered a speech, which is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>I left Germany not long ago, so after arriving here, people asked about the situation in my hometown. The mood of the German people today is not as excited as it was in the first year or two of the war. This is a natural phenomenon after a long war. But on the other hand, there is also something different, which is a firm determination, no matter how difficult it is, without any complaints, willing to endure, and persevere to the end even at the greatest sacrifice. Our enemies have clearly declared their war aims. Every German knows that defeat and surrender mean the end of Germany. Since we know this, we will bring out all our inner strength and use it in the war effort. Although the burden on each of us is very heavy, we still avoid everything and persevere to the end. In today's situation, every German is fully dedicated to the war effort, each doing their best to protect the motherland. There is no distinction between the front and the rear. The whole of Germany is a battle line.</p>
<p>In the evolution of the war over these years, in addition to the increased burden on the front lines, the rear has also become tense. The enemy often carries out fierce bombings, trying to destroy and defeat the fighting spirit of the people. In the whole of Germany, there is no place that has achieved their goals so far, which goes without saying. Just as the German soldiers are fighting bravely on the front lines, the people in the rear are also dealing with the enemy's blind bombing. Everyone is united as one, without distinction between each other. I am for everyone, and everyone is for me.</p>
<p>Thorough Air Defense Training</p>
<p>This spring, I personally witnessed the fierce air raids by the enemy in Berlin and central Germany, so I have a deep understanding of the efforts and spirit of every compatriot. The German people have undergone considerable education and systematic air defense training, day and night, regarding the dangers of air warfare, so they are prepared for the air defense of terror bombing. In all cities, the walls of all cellars are thickened with stone walls, or air-raid shelters are built with reinforced concrete for the residents. In addition, there are air defense fortresses above and below ground level. Those underground often have three or four floors, and those above ground have five floors. In case of emergency alarm, people go to take refuge.</p>
<p>Rescue after air raids is extremely rapid. Those who have been bombed can receive special licenses, along with a number of supplementary ration coupons, to purchase various necessities of life. Before the loss is accurately investigated, cash can be borrowed in advance from local authorities. After the bombing, the enthusiasm of the people in general reaches its peak, which I have never seen before. Everyone is willing to unconditionally give what little they have to their fellow victims.</p>
<p>Rapid Progress in Scientific Construction</p>
<p>German scientific construction is based on German chemistry, and it continues to proceed as before during the war in various ways. Although German universities and other educational institutions have been affected by the war, they are still running as usual in appropriate ways, and various scientific researches continue unabated, which can be proved by the emergence of new weapons in Germany.</p>
<p>Since I left the country this April, the war situation has become more tense, and there is a need for a total mobilization of the entire nation. Therefore, all the strength that anyone has that has not yet been directly used in the war effort must now be directly involved. All businesses that are not related to the decisive battle will be stopped, and all theaters, cinemas, concerts, etc., will be stopped.</p>
<p>However, the so-called total mobilization does not mean that the cultural aspects are completely abolished and no longer seek progress. We only need to listen to German radio programs on any evening to know that German newspapers and magazines, although limited, are still very rich in content.</p>
<p>The manufacture of ordinary consumer goods has been stopped. All necessities of life have standards, so they are very easy and simple to manufacture. The most important thing is the manufacture of military supplies. Every German thoroughly understands this and has an iron will to defend Germany with all his might.</p>
<h3>Director Matsushima Discusses the Philippine Island War and the Enemy's American Ambition to Dominate the World</h3>
<p>Director Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a speech yesterday (the 17th) at 2:00 PM at the Naval Attache's Office, as usual, to a group of Chinese reporters. The main points of what he said are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Enemy Ships Active East of Luzon Island</p>
<p>The mobile force led by Enemy American Major General Sherman seems to be active in the sea east of Luzon Island. Within this force, there are a dozen or so aircraft carriers, acting in three groups, with a configuration that is much lower than before. Because enemy ships have suffered disastrous defeats in the past, they are already planning to retreat before attacking. Although the Japanese naval and air forces were searching and annihilating enemy ships last month, they have not achieved decisive results due to poor weather conditions.</p>
<p>Enemy Surrounded on Leyte Island</p>
<p>The enemy land forces that landed on Leyte are being attacked by the Japanese army, which is becoming increasingly fierce. The Japanese army is fighting especially bravely on the road from Carigara to Oyamok. The Japanese army has now cut off the enemy on the Oyamok highway and is encircling and annihilating them. The enemy has repeatedly claimed victory in the battle on that front, but judging from the remarks made by the US Undersecretary of the Army, Patterson, it can be concluded that their so-called victory is completely wrong. Patterson said on the 16th of this month: The Japanese Navy is still giving us a major threat, the Air Force is also gradually increasing its attack power, and the Army's combat power is developing to a greater extent. Even if Germany is defeated, Japan will continue to fight, etc.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes on the Mainland are Nerve Warfare</p>
<p>The initiative of the Philippine operations is in the hands of Japan. The enemy is at a loss in this area, so it has turned to launching nerve warfare with air raids on the mainland. Today (the 17th), several enemy B-29s scouted the Jiangbei coast and Datong area. The fact that enemy planes are not fighting on the Philippine battlefield but are turning to activity in the Jinghu and Yangtze River coasts is enough to prove that they are avoiding the important and attacking the trivial, without combat power.</p>
<p>Enemy America's Ambition to Dominate the World</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on the 15th of this month, Roosevelt has three ambitions to dominate the world: (1) To make the US naval power exceed the naval power of the world; (2) The United States must possess the world's largest merchant fleet; (3) The United States will have a commercial shipping network covering the entire globe. This kind of megalomania of Enemy America is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Nelson Came to Destroy China</p>
<p>Nelson, the former director of the Munitions Production Bureau, recently led a large number of workers to Chongqing again. Among his workers, five are steelmaking experts and one is an alcohol-making expert. What people should pay attention to is that Nelson's coming here is not to build China, but to manufacture munitions in China and destroy China. In addition, he plans to monopolize China's political and economic rights. A British commentator once said: "China will become a country with nothing before and after the war." If Nelson's plan to come to China succeeds, the commentator's words will unfortunately come true.</p>
<p>Britain Also Shows Dissatisfaction with the United States</p>
<p>Regarding the China issue, Britain has also expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' conclusion. On the 15th of this month, British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lawes stated: "Britain has nothing to discuss about the current situation in China. In the future, the China issue is actually a part of the United States' problems," etc. From this, we can know Britain's dissatisfaction with the United States. Even in terms of the relations between Chongqing and the United States, there has recently been a trend towards disharmony. The exchange of propaganda between Chongqing and the United States has no other subject matter except for Japan as propaganda material. On the 15th of this month, the Chongqing Associated Press correspondent sent a telegram to New York saying: "Japan has now admitted defeat and is making a protracted war in the Philippines for future plans." This kind of nonsensical propaganda, which neither understands the facts nor takes into account the current situation, is extremely clumsy and ridiculous.</p>

<h3>Discussions on Salary Payment and Rice Distribution Issues for Faculty and Staff</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiuhe</p>
<p>Having read three news items related to education in the October 28th issue of this newspaper, I, though lacking in talent, would like to briefly express my views on matters closely related to my colleagues in the education sector, seeking correction from those more knowledgeable!</p>
<p>Firstly, it was about Director Dai of the Education Bureau answering reporters' questions, stating that concrete results have been achieved in improving the treatment of faculty and staff (increasing the original salary of $730 by 200%). Although the speed of price increases cannot be matched by the amount of increase, the concern of the municipal and educational authorities for educational workers is evident. The psychological comfort given to educational workers is indeed very valuable.</p>
<p>Secondly, it concerns the request to school authorities to "pay all the salaries of faculty and staff for a semester at the beginning of the semester so that faculty and staff can arrange their living needs for half a year in advance." This approach is unimpeachable in principle, but if we look at the facts, it may be difficult to implement, especially in private schools, given the current circumstances where everything is not satisfactory. Because, will a teacher remain unchanged from the beginning to the end of the semester? That is one question. If there is a change, will the overpayment of salary be fully refunded? That is another question. Even if a full refund is possible, and using the refunded amount—which may not purchase the same quantity of goods as when originally received—to find a replacement, will the replacement be suitable? That is another question. If these questions cannot be adequately resolved, the children whose parents pay tuition will inevitably suffer significant losses. Therefore, in my humble opinion, a more appropriate approach would be, after receiving tuition fees, the principal should convene all teachers in the school to jointly determine the total salary each teacher should receive for the semester, based on the tuition fee allocation principles stipulated by the Education Bureau. One-sixth should be paid as a preliminary advance, and the remaining five-sixths should be used to purchase rice in bulk and stored in the school. At the end of each month, the rice should be distributed to each person by quantity rather than price. In this way, regardless of rice price fluctuations, the quantity received by teachers each month will remain consistent. Even if a teacher leaves the school mid-term, the replacement will not suffer losses, and the school's administration will not face difficulties. Let's take the example of our school (Municipal Feihong Elementary School): At the beginning of this semester, based on the resolution of the first school affairs meeting, in addition to paying each person $12,000 in advance (approximately two-thirds of the tuition fee portion each person should receive for the semester) as a settling-in allowance, the rest was handed over to the dining committee to prepare firewood and rice for daily use. Therefore, even though the current rice price has exceeded $20,000 per dan and the firewood price has also approached $2,000 per load, the cost of meals at our school in October is only about $700 per person (three meals a day) (it was $608 in September). Teachers, though working diligently day and night, have never shown any signs of fatigue. Therefore, I feel that if the school authorities can treat the teachers with sincerity, then I believe the issue of salary payment can be easily resolved appropriately.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it concerns the issue of consolidating the special rice rations for faculty and staff. Administratively, there may still be inconveniences, as those entitled to extra rice rations are not limited to faculty and staff. Regarding the handling of this matter, let's take our school as an example: After receiving the ration coupons on October 19th, to save teachers from traveling back and forth, and to save on transportation costs and time, I and a teacher representative (the representative was nominated by the Morning Talk Meeting—the Morning Talk Meeting is a gathering of all faculty and staff in the school, held at 8:20 am every morning to review the work of the previous day and plan the progress of the current day's work) each rode bicycles to the public sales office to pay (the payment was temporarily advanced by the school and will be deducted at the end of the month), pick up the goods, transport them back to the school, and distribute them evenly. We have already received two installments, and the teachers have not experienced the suffering described by a group of teachers. But I don't know if this method can be used for reference by other schools.</p>
<p>In short, education is a grand plan for cultivating people. Our lives may be simple and frugal, but our responsibilities are very heavy. Some shortsighted people may regard us friends who deliver critiques with chalk as fools who are both ignorant and mediocre, but we have our own beliefs and our own ideals. Wu Xun was willing to let people call him a beggar, but he could not extinguish his enthusiasm for establishing schools. I also hope that my colleagues in the education sector will all offer a sincere heart and promote mutual assistance to work together for the children. Then, the future of the family and the nation may have hope. (The稿酬 will be used to support scholarship fund.)</p>

<h3>Responding to the Giving of Clothes and Gruel</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yunsheng wrote: "Dear Sir, the fourteenth of this month was the one-month anniversary of my daughter Lifen. I am deeply grateful for the generous gifts from relatives and friends. Therefore, I have converted the cash and gifts received into a total of $39,963.40, and I am transferring $19,963.40 to your organization for winter relief expenses, and $10,000 each to the Nursing Home and the Pushan Villa, for the benefit of all relatives and friends. I am enclosing three checks and request that you kindly accept and forward them."</p>
<p>Charity in Mind</p>
<p>Mr. Dong Fangjiande, residing in a corner of Shanghai, sees many isolated, poor, and weak people suffering from hunger and cold, unable to make a living, urgently needing relief. Therefore, he has donated $10,000 from his private savings, allocating $1,000 each to the Charity's poverty relief fund, elementary school teacher medical assistance fund, small business loan fund, destitute children assistance fund, medical assistance fund, and maternity assistance fund. Furthermore, as the weather is getting colder and severe winter is approaching, the poor are exposed to the wind and dew, and their suffering is even more unbearable. He generously donated $4,000 for winter relief expenses in response. Also, Mr. Wu Hangben and Mr. Zhu Aqi either donated exclusively to the destitute children assistance fund or divided their donations among the Charity's various assistance funds, all demonstrating enthusiasm for public welfare and a charitable heart, which is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>Children's Welfare Association Appeals for Donations, Hopes All Sectors Will Act Righteously</h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association, to maintain the educational work of over 300 orphaned children, launched a fundraising campaign recently. It has been over a week, and donations from all sectors have been quite enthusiastic. The orphaned children cared for by the association are the most pitiful and tragic children in society. Among them are children who have become beggars on the streets due to the deaths of their parents or family separation due to the war. There are also children who have been abandoned by their parents due to poverty, becoming street vagrants. If we do not take measures to rescue these children who are poorly clothed, poorly fed, and sleeping on the streets, the tragic phenomenon is unimaginable.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda." Saving the life of an orphaned child now means cultivating a portion of vitality for the country and preserving a glimmer of hope for the nation. We deeply hope that enthusiastic people in society will act righteously and support this righteous cause. If you are willing to donate, the Social Services Department of this newspaper can also collect donations in addition to the direct collection by the association.</p>
