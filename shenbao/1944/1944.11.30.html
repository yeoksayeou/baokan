<h3>楠本公使會見記</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>提到　任盟邦駐北京公使　本實隆中將，也許對於第一個上海人是不會生疏的。在事變以後，他曾任上海特務機關長，自與亞院成立即改任該院華中連絡部次長，後來在盟邦軍隊密波登陸之後，他還擔任着浙東地方政治復興的指導責任。尤其對於後者，當時確曾樹立出一個中日合作的良謨，對於一般浪人想偕機發財者嚴加取締，至今甬人尙懷念不置。記者此次由本報特派北來，適逢他以新任公使的資格招待新聞記者，是一個上海人當然便不能錯過這樣一個接談的機會吧。</p>
<p>中日記者一視同仁</p>
<p>楠本公使是十一月一日由靑搭機抵平，除於當日下午二時至三時接見中日雙方要人外，第一個被蒙招待的便是次日下午四時半至六時的記者茶會，此次招待新聞記者，是僅以記者爲限，而不限國籍，所以無論中日或其它第三國的新聞記者皆得參加。這樣一視同仁的氣度，早就使記者發生良好的印象。其次，普通的集會往往規定在四時半，至少要等待到五時，可是今天楠本公使却準時蒞會，且露出一副滿臉春風的和靈面容。我想，第一位記者對於他是不會有壞印象的吧。</p>
<p>二十年前舊地重</p>
<p>大家坐定以後，楠本公使首即開口說：「北京是我二十年前舊遊之地，此次在決戰時代出任公使而重故土，實有回到家鄕之感。」原來，楠本公使在二十年以前，曾任我國北京陸軍大學敎官之職，所以他對我國是素有淵源，在渝方抗戰陣容中，他的高足亦復不少。據楠本公使說，如果他現在能有機會和他的那批抗戰陣容中的高　　一懇談的話，也許他們也不至執迷不醒的。在這個決戰入緊張的時候，楠本公使此次負着大命來此決戰基地的華北，自然含有極重要的意義。可是他很客氣，他只是說明仍將和以前鹽澤公使一樣，加重華北所展開的增產和增運工作。同時，他這次來華北，見到過去關於增產和增運工作的成功，更對華馮一億官民表示感謝。</p>
<p>和衷共濟團結一致</p>
<p>他這次在離開東京之前，曾聆取小　首相的意見，且已抱有　華關明朗化的決心，但在開始此項工作之前，却很希望能够聽到現地中日雙方的意見，所以他很謙遜地熱望着方面能予他此種任務的恊助。他說，對於華北只有以明朗和壯怏的精神始能貫徹決戰基地的使命。他對這一點，希望無中日人民均應確實和衷共濟團結一致，尤其祈求當地日僑能善體此意。故他的所謂明朗化，就是中日人民和恊無縫，搏成一體的意思。他說：「普通對中日二國常以兄弟之邦目之，其實音指兄弟關係還是不够。我以爲這種兄弟關係應站在同科的立場上顯現出來。　如吧，在共同完成某項任務時，假定此項任務是中國人的特長，則這中國人是小弟。反之，如果某項工作是日本人特長，則中國人自然也是小弱點了！」　者可以不難明白，以這樣風度的一位盟邦中將出任北京公使，華北未來的政治自然極有希望的。</p>
<p>戰時經濟最爲複雜</p>
<p>楠本公使發言旣竟，於是他等着各位記者的質詢。最初提出質詢的大都爲日本和滿洲國的記者，中國記者經楠本公使，再虛心詢問時始見一人起問：「楠本公使想必見過王委員長，不知能否將其談話大槪奉告？」楠本公使隨即回答說；「因時間匆促，尙未及多談。」至於日滿記者之質詢，最重要者爲戰時的經濟政策。楠本公使對於這個問題目爲極爲複雜，他本乎過去在上海與寗波的經驗來說，似乎有時適合於中國一般大衆的政策，在日僑方面便感到有問題。</p>
<p>大槪快到六點鐘的時候，楠本公使便邀請記者等至　室略進香檳茶點，當時記者適站於公使對談的機會。記者首先發言：「當公使閣下在上海任維哲學院院長的時候，記者適任該學院敎授，所以我們或者已經見過了！」楠本公使接得記者名片後，始點首而笑着問申報的情形。記者便說：「此次國光華北得覩公使閣下前來故都實深慶幸，謹代表陳社長問候。」於是記者乃提出一個問題來問他：「以前閣下在上海和寗波時，前後作風似有不同之處，不知此次來華北又有何種偉大的抱負？」公使笑着說：「華中人民畢竟富有敏感，當我下機以後往故都略作巡遊，覺得和二十年以前並無不同。」當楠本公使滔滔不絕地談下去的時候，忽然有他人揷言，所以我問的那個問題，便紿終並沒有答案了！好在重富報道班長說，等公使有空暇的時候，我們以後隨時都可以去見他的。</p>
<p>關心我國新聞事業</p>
<p>這個時候，盟邦讀賣新聞特派員海野秀雄氏，聽見我是申報記者便來和我攀談。他問我：「陳社長也到北方來嗎？」我說：「沒有。」他便接着說：「上次我在上海的時候，多承陳社長賜助！實在感謝得很！」由此可知盟邦的同業者，對於我國新聞事業重視的一斑了。不久已鐘鳴六時，大家才興盡而歸。（寄自北京）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>受助學生成績展覽會</h3>
<p>從明天（十二月一日）起我們假座八仙橋中國靑年會舉行申報讀者助學金受助學生成績展覽會，這些都是諸位讀者們把血汗來培植的結果，這些都是許多受助學生們勤勞勉力的工作，這不過是第一步的示學成績，將來學成之後，在社會上替國家民族服務，第二步第三步以至無窮數的成績，在在要表現在國人之前，替未來的中華民國造成一個新局面。好比種花，諸位讀者們都是園主人，諸位受助學生們都是好花的種子，我們只不過是一個微小的園丁，但是，在僅僅四年裏面，我們在園主人的指導鼓勵和愛護之下，搜集了不少名花奇卉的種子，這些種子，假如沒有園主人的愛惜，也許早就被人們所遺棄在荒蕪的泥沙裏，或許連生長的能力已經不可能，當然更談不到開花和結果。現在這些種子很幸運地在四年來，蒙諸位讀者們負起灌溉和培植的責任，蒙全上海各界人士的愛護和指示，我們做園丁的用全副精神去扶持着，注意着，看他們慢慢地萌芽滋長，一步一步地走上開花結果的路，我們心裏的愉快眞是不可以言語形容，同時我們敢說，諸位園主人們精神上的愉快，吏要比我們加上幾倍，我們再敢說，這不但是園主人的愉快，而是整個上海人士，整個中華民國國民的愉快。</p>
<p>這些學生們，雖然不必是我們的子弟，不必是我們親戚朋友的子弟，但是，我們的愛護他們都是超越了我們自己的子弟，因爲他們是全社會的子弟，是全中國的子弟，是下一代中華民國的基礎。任何人不應當損害他們，任何人不應當疏忽他們。對於受助學生的身體，品行和學業，我們要十二分地留心，假如略有一點疏忽的地方，就兔對於整個社會整個中國做了一件最大的罪惡，這是我們的信條，根據這個信條，我們繼續不斷地工作着，到底我們能够做到幾分，我們希望諸位指敎，我們更願以一個最最誠懇的心，要求諾位最最坦白的批評和指導。</p>
<p>可憐哉，這些清寒優秀的靑年！可愛哉，這些．新中華民國的同胞！可敬哉，諸位熱心的申報讀者們！從諾位讀者們的一念，一舉手間，集腋成裘，使數千俊秀靑年繼續上進，微小的因，可以結成這樣偉大的果，這可說是近代中國的奇蹟，這也是我們中華民國五千年來能雊獨立自存的主要精神，從諸位心中的一念，可以引起許多人的同情，可以喚起大家的互助，這就是證明人類的心靈是互通的，人類的本能是互助的。</p>
<p>助學事業只不過是「互通」「互助」的一點微小的表現，這個表現雖然僅僅幾年工夫，已有相當成績，可是這不過是一個最低限度的成績。放眼看社會上有多少失學青年還不能够享受讀書的權利，再靜靜想，目前受助的數千靑年，在這樣環境之下，還需要怎樣地努力扶持使他們能够繼續上進，不致功虧一簣。我們還要繼續努力，我們要永久地造因，我們自然能够永久地結果。</p>
<p>附吿：二十六日星期評論戴吉田先生著「誰是中國革命的領導者」一文，係第一節，尙有續文待刋。</p>
<h3>展開快速進攻　日軍佔領南丹　沿公路向貴陽進</h3>
<p>桂林廿九日中央社電據廣西前綫日軍基地訊，日軍精銳部隊，向前挺進。廿八日上午十時，佔領西南丹，及南丹機場，俘虜渝軍甚夥，奪獲機關車貨車及其他軍需資才多數。又據廣西前綫日軍基地電，日軍快速部隊，攻陷廣西最後據點南丹後，仍沿西南公路及黔桂鐵道，向貴陽方面挺進，渝軍有五萬之衆，向該方面撤退，日軍繼續追擊。廿九日正午，已進抵南丹北方十八公里地方，現仍繼續展開快速進攻中。</p>
<p>貴省日軍展開激戰</p>
<p>貴州前綫廿九日中央社電　貴州南部渝軍，奉命阻止日軍向黔桂鐵路及公路正面進攻，正作拚命抵抗。省境要衝黎明關北方，及南丹北方之貴州省內，曾展開激烈之內搏戰。日軍於槍林彈雨之下，反復進攻，刻正擴大戰果中。</p>
<p>廣西前綫日軍基地廿八日中央社電　日軍快速部隊繼續向貴州省境之胡宗南第四十一師，及頑强抵抗之蔣直系軍第三十師，並河池方面之殘敗部隊猛攻。廿八日上午十一時，向南丹東南八公里之處，前前攻擊中。</p>
<p>桂林二十九日中央社電　黔桂鐵路北進中之日軍部隊，已　於本月二十四日突入貴州省境。桂林大公報記者，曾在本年四月間，於該報揭戰關於黔桂鐵道之實情，茲將其大意介紹如次：黔桂鐵路自柳州起至獨山止，全長三百九十四公里，需時二十二時四十分。鐵路之設備甚爲粗劣，故乘客甚感痛苦。自柳州起，沿路均屬高低不平之斜面地帶，棧關車常開行其他之鐵路，且平常三分之一均拖帶貨車，其中尤以關東至砑泗亭六十公里，爲黔桂鐵路建築工程中之最困難者。該地拔海六百公尺以上，上下地上約有十個巖石山洞，開發巖山洞時之情況，以及築堤工程所動員數萬工人。此外並有許多灣曲谿谷，工程亦甚困難。鐵路終點之獨山，則爲海拔九百公尺上之高原地帶，自鐵路開通後，已成爲交通上之要衝，亦爲貴州省南部地方之政治中心。軍站內貴　館之食堂，常見英美蘇及各國人士，且下黔桂鐵路在軍事上實負有重大意義，至於將來直通貴陽時，其在經濟上之價值，將有莫大之發展。</p>
<h3>摩羅泰敵後方　日精銳登陸　空軍同時轟炸敵機塲</h3>
<p>南方前綫某地二十九日中央社電　日軍精銳一部，于淼田部隊長指揮下，二十六日黎明在摩羅遭任何抵抗即吿成功，刻正在激戰中。又摩羅泰島日軍敢死隊連夜進擊美軍陳地，並對敵達爾巴機塲屢予猛攻，除十八日前斃敵七十六名，毀營幕十七處外，復斃敵五十五名，毀營幕一處。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地二十九日中央社電　日軍二十二夜以來，大舉襲擊摩羅泰，該地敵基地已瀕潰滅，據日偵查機二十五日報吿，所獲戰果較二十六日大本營發表之二十二·三兩日戰果尤大，計大型機十一架，中型機一架起火燃燒，大型機一架重創，二十架已不能使用，又須修理者九架。又日空軍二十四夜復强襲摩羅泰機塲，並冒熾烈砲火，反覆痛炸該機塲，結果有五處起火，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>晝襲塞班迭尼安　日機作低空轟炸　大本營發表航空隊戰果</h3>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日大本營二十九日下午四時三十分發表：（一）日航空部隊曾於十一月二十七日晝間，猛烈襲擊塞班島及迭尼安島敵機場，並作低空襲擊，使飛機場中之敵機及設施大受損害，日機末飛還者共九架。（二）日航空部隊於十一月二十九日拂曉，攻擊塞班島敵機場，炸毀其四處，使之起火。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　迭次奮戰前綫之日海軍一式陸上攻擊隊，在二十九日轟炸塞班島一役中，亦曾參與作戰，充分發揮其威力。</p>

<h3>三國宣言四週年　中日滿緊密協力　進一步提携完成興亞偉業</h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　今日（三十日）爲中·日·滿三國共同宣言四週年紀念日，當此大東亞戰爭決戰之秋，實尤覺其意義之深長。蓋四年前，中·日·滿共同宣言發表之時，東亞局勢雖已危機四伏，然戰爭尚未爆發，危局猶可挽回。三國共同宣言之發表，即欲於此解決中日糾紛之根源，進而求東亞之和平。迨至翌年十二月，終因美國堅持侵略東亞之陰謀，致大東亞戰爭卒告勃發，自是以後，東亞情勢已爲之一變。迄三十二年一月，吾國參戰，於是否人之任務，乃不僅在秋全面和平之實現，尤須爲確保永久和平而協力戰爭，以擊破英美之侵略勢力。中·日·滿。共同宣言之意義，至此乃亦更進一步。蓋宣言之本旨，已因是而由互相提携，共求繁榮進至緊密協力，爲擊滅敵人，保衛東亞之戰，傾其全力。</p>
<p>詎料吾國不幸，又遭汪主席之喪，國失領袖，民失導師，吾人於悲慟哀悼之餘，逢此三國宣言四週年紀念，回憶去年今日，正爲中日同盟條約締結後止第一月，大東亞共同宣言發表未滿一月之時，汪主席由滬視察返京，曾發表談話。其中有調中·日·滿三國敦睦邦交之基點，爲東亞大陸建立軸心之礎石，亦爲大東亞各國團結合作之張本。今則更進而有大東亞共同宣言之發表，兩者精神意志，完全相同，而東亞各國相信相扶，共存共榮之基本原則，更見光明，共榮圈之範圍，更見擴大。自茲以往，唯當根據中·日·滿·共同宣言，一而本諸大東亞共同宣言，以求東亞軸心之強固，而謀大東亞戰爭之完遂，與打東亞共同見識之實現。今汪主席不及見其理想之實現，而溘然長逝，五人爲實現主席遺志，惟有遵照主席之訓示，與盟邦緊密協力，勇猛精進，以發揚三國共同宣言之精神，完成大東亞之共榮建設。</p>
<p>新京二十九日中央社電　中·日·滿·三國共同宣言四週年紀念，李外務大臣發表談話，大意略謂，奠定東亞團結礎石之中·日·滿三國共同宣言，今已屆四週年。當次大東亞決戰關頭，回顧當年宣誓於世界而奠興亞永久礎石之三國共同宣言，設不勝感激。蓋自中·日·滿·共同宣言發表以後，中·滿兩國始交換使節，相互正是承認。此後國民政府由中日同盟條約之締結，而毅然向美英宣戰，於是中·日·滿三國乃於同一目標下，共趨於擊滅美英，復興東亞之途邁進。當次大戰正面臨決戰之際，興亞之重任，應由我中·日·滿·三國共同肩起，今後當更進一步緊密協力，齊一步伐，達成興亞之偉業。</p>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　十一月三十日爲中·日·滿·宣言四週年紀念日，駐京滿洲國大使館，時定於是日上午十時，在該館會議廳舉行紀念儀式。張代理大使並定於是日晨，赴我國民政府及日本大使館，分別致賀。</p>

<h3>反軸心傘兵　在巴登降陸　對佛日鉗攻勢展開中</h3>
<p>沮里希二十九日中央社電　據此間所得消息：凡軸心空輸部隊廿七日已於巴登地方（Baden萊因河東方約六十公里，在瑞士國境之北）降陸，詳情刻尚不明。然該項空輸隊並非有力部隊，傳爲企圖破緊通達亞爾蕯斯地方之鐵路。</p>

<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：星期一美第三軍在洛林　薩爾區對西綫前哨之總攻，正在激烈進行中。至以巴頓將軍之左翼而論，其進攻已成相反之運動，即德軍在里米許與曼齊格間發動堅強之反攻，東南波爾森—聖阿伏爾特沿綫之大戰繼續進行，局勢極爲流動。薩爾運河與萊因河間，德軍後衛對前進之美第三軍右翼與美第七軍左翼繼續作戰，以保護德主力向新陣地撤退。亞爾薩斯區進入斯特拉斯堡之美第七軍一部，與在牟羅茲區之法第一軍坦克隊，正展開鉗型攻勢，向佛日高低與萊因河上游之平原，繼續作鉗形之壓力，但昨經激戰後已被遏阻。</p>
<p>科隆平原大戰方酣</p>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　西綫科隆平原之激戰，更加熾烈。據巴黎消息，德軍刻正集結大部隊於該地，並出動最精銳之預備軍，故反軸心軍之進攻因而停滯於亞琛東北部。美軍數師企圖突入魯爾區，經充分準備砲火後，刻在再度作大規模之攻擊，但卒被德軍擊退。又據倫敦電：該地區之美第九軍，刻已到達防衛科隆最後要衝之魯爾河畔。有美第三軍刻進抵距離薩爾勃魯根市十公里之地點，但已爲德軍所阻。</p>

<h3>英空軍重大損失　地下火藥庫爆炸　聲聞六十英里以外</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　英國丫郟特倫特師（倩昏西北約八十公里）附近之地下火藥庫，二十七日突然爆炸，據路透社訊，其聲遠達六十英里以外，該地已形成以露天大穴，附近一帶亦受甚大損失，事務所與農塲等皆被毀無存，死者數目尚不明，據某方稱，約在二百二十八名以上。又該爆炸事發生不久，消息即傳遍歐洲各地，據德國消息方面稱，該次爆炸之火藥，價值數百萬元以上，其量可供對德大規模空襲數百次之用。</p>
<p>爆炸原因</p>
<p>至於爆炸原因雖尚未明，或係因V2號之攻擊所致。又最值入注意者，爲英國之消息中曾特別之處幷列舉數項，（一）該爆炸力激烈空前，亘數小時爆炸之聲不絕，（二）弄團及建築物皆影跡無存，（三）附近之工塲與建築物皆被炸毀，即遠至數英里外之建築物亦多被損壞。</p>
<h3>奉行　主席遺志　中國國民黨告民衆書　（二）</h3>
<p>本黨爲三民主義的革命黨，故必須有強固之組織，整肅的紀律，嚴格的訓練，而後能是黨員爲主義爲奮鬥，必須使黨員真能爲主義而奮歸，日後能深入民間，使三民主義普及於大衆。又必須使三民主義能普及於國民大衆，而後能結集全民族統一，意志，培養其前進的創造力，以與對建勢力及侵略勢力搏　，而建立獨立自由之現代國家。十三年春，我總理召集第一次全國代表大會，改組本黨，一方面展開廣大之民衆運動，其根本精神，即在於此。十八九年間我主席高揭護黨救國之大業，「於黨恢復民主集權，於國實現民主政治」，其主要任務，亦在於此。</p>
<p>大三民主義的革命黨之所以異於普通政黨者，以其能從民主衆中間選拔最優秀而最前進之份子，以爲革命之前鋒也，以其能組織民衆，領導民衆，以爲可業而持久之革命隊伍也，以其能策動民衆，訓練民衆，樹立廣大而集中的民主勢力，以此勢力致力於革命鬭爭，並致力於革命政權之運用與確保也。革命鬭爭之目的，固在革命政權之確立，而此政權不還於革命的生產民衆，授諸革命的生產民衆屬之革命的生產民衆，非少數軍閥官僚政客所得而假借，負革命產婆重任之革命黨人惟當鞠躬盡瘁，選賢與能，受國民之付託，行使其治權而已。斯實革命民衆至精神，抑亦反封建鬥爭之要件。</p>
<p>黨員深入民間進行推動工作</p>
<p>我主席闡述遺教，指示　詳，其於革命勢力之結成，有曰：「所謂革命其真實意義，即在喚起被壓迫在下層之大多數民衆，使從事政治鬥爭，以得到政績，藉以解除痛苦，增進幸福。」「欲此大多數民衆從事政治鬥爭，唯有先將其中之最覺悟份子團結起來，使有訓練有組織，成爲有能力的戰鬥員，然後能領導一般民衆，積極參加政治鬥爭，此種團結，即所調黨，此種戰鬥員，即所謂黨員。」期於黨治民治之關係則「主張勵行黨治與培植民權並重」，「對於覺悟份子固當與以發展其活動能力之自由，即對於未覺悟份子，亦當掖誘獎引，使其活動能力得漸漸自由發展。」「人民之言論集會出版等自由，必當予以切實之保障。」又曰：「黨不能高臨於人民之上」，而當「深入人民之內」，所以黨員絕不能在民衆之上成—「特殊階級」，而「要在人民之內做　導的工作，做推動的工作」，使人民的力量日漸充實，日漸擴大，真能擔負國民革命的重任，此爲每一黨員應盡之天職。「能如是方是同志，不然便是敵人，能如是方是人民之前驅，不然便是民賊。」其言之深切著名如此。蓋深痛失總理殁後民主集權之精神已被遺忘，民主勢力未由樹立，將使革命變其本質，國民失其信仰。</p>
<p>聯合全國志士共同收拾時局</p>
<p>二十六年事變將其之前，既反覆說明民主政治爲團結民衆之根本，「平時將政治自由給與人民愈多，一旦有非常之變，則應付愈加容易，因爲國家由人民集合而成，人民的政治能力強大，則國家的力量亦因以強大。」「應付國難政府與民衆相依爲命，是其本質，政府盡忠於人民，人民信任其政府，是其　活動。」「中國今日在內憂外患重重交迫之中，惟有以整個國家民族的共同利益爲根據，以求團結，方　立得定一個強有力的基礎。」二十八年於本黨第六次全國代表大會宣言，復鄭重宣布「除共產黨外，凡屬人民皆有集會結社言論出版之自由，本黨願以至誠聯合全國有志之士，部份派別，共有担負收拾時局之責任。」「必有健全之民主組織乃能有敏捷值集權行動，故自由意志與紀律實當並重，必如是然後黨乃能集中意志集中力量，必如是然後黨乃能不斷的吸收有獨立見解及自由思想的份子，以同負責任遇事乃能有真實值認識，堅決之行動。」三十年冬大東亞戰爭勃發之前，更於本黨六屆四中全會發起新國民運動綱要，以爲組織民衆，訓練青年之万針。「先普及於一般同志，以爲前驅，繼普及於一般同胞，以形成中華民國之金城湯池。」是以担負「保衛東亞的大戰爭」之新使命。此自總理殁後我主席領導反封建東芝之經驗，凡我同志暨我同胞，所當繼承遺志，貫澈始終者一也。</p>
<p>容共分共政策運用初無二致</p>
<p>十三年本黨改組，容共政策同時決定。然改組爲一事，容共又爲一事。改組精神已如上述，容共政策則總理在第一次去昂代表大會之際，已剴切曉論，在使一般有思想之新青年，認識三民主義爲國民革命而共同奮鬥，不致誤入歧途。故共產黨員之加入本黨內爲「改共產黨員爲國民黨員。」本黨之容納共產黨員，非爲「改國民黨爲共產黨。」不但此也，十二年一月二十六日，我總理與列寧代表越飛，發表聯合宣言，其第一條即明白指出「共產組織，甚至蘇維埃制度，事實均不能引用於中國，」「此項見解，越飛君完全同感。」故本黨之容納共產黨員，乃在認定「中國幷無使共產組織，或蘇維埃制可以成功之情況。」共產黨員之加入本黨，亦即認定「中國最要最急之問題，乃在民國之統一的成功，與完全國家的獨立之獲得。」不但此也，國民革命以帝國主義爲其對象，「所以必須喚起一切被帝國主義壓迫的民衆，以從事國民革命，」「必不能以一階級的專於而底於成功。」是則容共云者，全視乎其能否共同致力於國民革命以爲斷。十三年至容共，十六年之分共，政策運用，初無二致。分共以後，共產黨徒禍國殃民之暴行，日益昭著。其「宣傳土地政策之末期，純爲張獻忠李自成之面目，其殺人放火，乃生吞活剝方法所必致之結果，」即在今日，猶復如此。九一八變起，本黨同志，全國各方，在「以建設求統一，以均權求共治」口號之下，精誠團結，重定統一之局，憂患雖深，國事尚有可爲。乃共產黨徒包藏禍心，藉對外的宣傳，爲對內的煽亂。淞滬之役，政府調江西軍隊赴援，而共匪即猛攻撫州。古北口之役，政府調長江軍隊赴援，而共匪即破撫州，攻南昌。此所以三十二年以後，中央有「洽標莫急於剿除共匪，治本莫急於生產建設」之決策。誠以匪氛恣肆，患在腹心，苟不絕其根株，戰其兇燄，則對內對外，一切計劃，均無從　手也。在政治軍事並進剿共之中，共匪餘孽，日趨窮蹙，已如釜底游魂。初不料西安一變，竟得而死灰復燃，於此之時，我主席重申「防共應有志決心」，嚴斥所謂「人民陣綫」之錯誤，於本黨五屆三中全會宣言，更剖釋民生主義與共產主義之不同，以杜絕共產黨徒之陰謀，並以破除失敗主義者之短見。然未及數月，事變已發，民族元氣，日益斬喪，國際陰謀，日以加甚，再不及早辭則垂危之局，益無可爲矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>日軍特別攻擊隊　發揮光榮戰果　出淵部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本上海陸軍部出淵報導部長，昨（廿九）日下午三時，在報導常會席上，發表日本陸海軍特別攻擊隊之壯烈戰果，並闡明在大陸作戰上之日本陸軍，忠勇義烈，忍受一切困難，推行道義作戰，與特別攻擊隊相映，發揮光榮戰果。其談話如次：</p>
<p>神風威靈屹然不動</p>
<p>關於菲島戰況中之日本陸軍特別攻擊隊，萬朶隊，富　隊，八紘隊，相互呼應，斬致偉大戰果，樹立堅強決心，誓將敵人英美完全擊滅，在未獲得最後勝利之前，決不中　。故在神風特別攻擊隊前次出動攻擊時，即先獲得壯烈偉大戰果，當戰果發表後，乃有頗多之日本國民踴躍自願投誠，希望爲特別攻擊隊員，此項熱誠精神，陸續不斷發現，繼承先烈遺志，予敵英美給以更大打擊。如太平洋上有敵美艦船蹤跡之存在，則特別攻擊隊之工作，始終繼續攻擊，日本方面既具茲特別之威力，至今兀然未動，沉着應付敵方。</p>
<p>大陸前綫不斷推進</p>
<p>日本特別攻擊隊員忠勇無比之行動，已使敵人心驚胆懼，世界各國，亦嘆爲觀止，但日軍特別攻擊隊之前赴後繼精神，更爲振發，而在起那些作戰每一將士，均抱有特別攻擊隊員同樣之決心努力在疆塲上活躍，同時再以大陸作戰而言，當日軍完全佔領敵美空軍最大重要根據地之桂林柳州後，仍繼續追擊殘敗敵軍，冒廣西山巔天險之困難，努力作戰，業已佔領南甯，又進軍貴州省內，艱苦卓絕之猛烈作戰，不斷向前推進，忍受所有困難，推行道義作戰，其行動實與特別攻擊隊之精神，相互輝映，唯有此種日軍之忠勇義烈精神，是乃日本廣大之戰力保障，亦即大東亞戰爭必勝之保障。</p>

<h3>歷代名瓷展　今日閉幕</h3>

<h3>吳泉籟同學　西畫展隨記</h3>
<p>— 溫肇桐</p>
<p>上海畫壇的每況愈下，這是無可詞言的事實。因爲，一般從事　畫的青年，他們所知道的，是造型技術的熱練，或是感覺與趣味的追尋。但·結果，前者是變爲徒具膚淺平凡的所謂寫實，實在不過是毫無聲明的庸俗技術而已，後者則顧到製作商一時的痛快，卻忽略了基礎描寫的準確，於是又歸于空虛和浮泛了。</p>
<p>泉籟同學這次展覽的作品，包括了近十年來研究的結晶，看到他的每一幅的油畫或素描，會使你發現他是處處在找尋出路，不，他是在嘗試各種新鮮的技法，不論是構思，筆觸，色彩與位置，在表面上看某幅有某幅的特點，我們看了五十五號「靜物」與五十四號「美人蕉」，會相信我這種說法是比較合理的，可是，他的藝術，畢竟建築在穩固的基石之上，所以又可說本質上完全一致的，因爲還有四十號「歸途遙」與七號「花瓶」諸幅，可以作者方面的玩索理。</p>
<p>優秀的活潑的現代藝術，是需要把造型技術做手段，感覺與趣味的表現爲目的。此次海粟先生爲之欣然主催展覽，意義也正在這裏，而且，力矯時弊，也正在此一舉呢。</p>
<h3>物資統審會　將開首次常會　定下月初舉行</h3>

<h3>海軍水兵訓練所　昨行畢業禮　船員養成所同時舉行</h3>

<h3>空襲是與節電後的學校上課問題</h3>
<p>— 林溫茶</p>
<p>因爲前幾次的空襲，學校方面，對於學生上課的問題，議論紛紛，莫衷一是。同時，「再度停電」已經實行。因爲節電雖然是一般的普遍問題，但間接對學生晚間自修工作很大，同時我所提供的意見，也有連帶關係的，所以合併討論。</p>
<p>我的意見，是提供本市教育當局的，希望明令頒佈，以收統一之效。——爲了節省篇幅起見，略去理論，側重實際方案。</p>
<p>（甲）全市各校，一律採用半日上課制，辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）上午八時起，至一時止，共六節。每節上課四十分鐘，每課休息十分鐘，共佔三百分鐘，合五小時計算。</p>
<p>（二）各校酌量情形，必要時，得暫時停止課間操，及課外的一切球類活動，（惟一律須屬行早操）</p>
<p>（三）美術·手工·音樂等科，酌量減少授課時間，由各校斟酌情形，指導學生自由的課外作業。</p>
<p>（四）如空襲警報在上午發出，除已經上課，應由學校依照防空條例，負責辦理外，如在八時以前，警戒警報一經發出，家長應即停止子女到校。</p>
<p>（五）如警報在一時前解除，各校應在當日下午補授上午功課，（辦法參照上午行之）—是項辦法決定後，由各學校預先通知家長，不必臨時知照。</p>
<p>（六）如遇全日警報，各校應充分利用「星期日」或「星期六下午」補授是日之各科課程。</p>
<p>（七）辦法公佈後，全市公私立學校，應一律遵照辦理，以免兼課老師，發生時間上衝突情形。</p>
<p>（乙）通令各學生家長，應切實依照下列各項，督導其子女：</p>
<p>（一）在路上進行中，聽到警報，應立即尋覓待避所，或離家較近者，迅速折回家中。如已離校不遠，仍可奔避到校。</p>
<p>（二）每日離校後，應立即返家，盡量將當天應做之自修工作，或課外作業，在下午完畢，晚上一律不必再做自修。</p>
<p>（三）巡邏兒童，實踐早眠早起，充分利用白天工作時間，盡量減少遊戲及休息，把精神集中起來，應付最困難之形勢。</p>
<p>上述各項辦法，簡述其梗概，如　當局迅予採納，以劍及屬及之方式，命令施行，對於空襲及節電情形下之青年學子，其學業與生活，深信必能於最短期間，屬行改善也。</p>
<p>對公司裁員問題　報告意見實事　何素民</p>
<p>本月二十三日本增載有李良如君「對公司裁員問題貢獻一點意見」一文，說理透澈，切合實情。</p>
<p>友人某君，供職本市某大印書館，昨日談及該館曾於本月法布通告，訂定甲乙兩種辦法，大致甲種爲留職不辦事，自下月起可以不到公司辦事，每月由公司照十一月份薪水津貼全數（諸○該館職員工役現在每月所得薪水津貼最低級者爲九千餘元）結發至明年九月止，其原職仍保留，由公司視營業需要臨時通知恢復到公司辦事。乙種爲退職，由公司一次發給退職金薪水津貼十個月，凡職工不論何人自動願照甲種或乙種辦理者，可於本月內向公司申請照辦，本月內不申請者，下月起仍照常辦事。按該館辦法正與李君意見之第一點不謀而合，且更爲周到。</p>

        <h1>1944.11.30</h1>
<h3>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: The Results of the Yaso Flying Corps - Ten Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed in Leyte Gulf</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 29th: (1) The Japanese special attack unit, the Yaso Flying Corps, using ten aircraft, fiercely attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on November 27th, sinking and destroying ten enemy ships. Details are as follows: Sinking one battleship, three large cruisers, four large transport ships, severely damaging and burning one battleship or large cruiser, and one large transport ship. Three Japanese escort fighters did not return in this operation. (2) The members of the Yaso Flying Corps who participated in this operation are as follows: Commander, Lieutenant Hideji Tanaka of the Army; members, Second Lieutenant Yukikichi Tsunotani of the Army, Nobu Fujinami, Hideo Morimoto, Zenjiro Zenke, Kenichi Takeuchi, Koji Terada, Kunimitsu Shiraishi, Shichiro Dojo, and Shunichi Baba.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army, maintaining a spirit of fighting to the death, and the Yaso Flying Corps, a special attack unit awaiting the opportunity to attack enemy bases, advanced over Leyte Gulf on the morning of the 27th after enshrining their spirits at Yasukuni Shrine. They fiercely attacked enemy ships in the harbor and engaged in aerial combat with five P38 and five P41 enemy fighter squadrons.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, the Ukon Corps and the Tenth Seibu Corps, strongly attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on the morning of the 26th. After eliminating enemy interference, the air squadrons inflicted great losses. On the same day, the night aviation unit attacked enemy transport ships in Leyte Gulf, inflicting heavy damage.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain on Leyte Island - Fierce Battles in the Mud - Japanese Forces in the North Shrinking the Encirclement</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In the land battles on Leyte Island, the Japanese and American forces are engaged in increasingly fierce fighting amidst heavy rain and mud, traversing dense forests and steep mountains. The air forces of both sides are also continuously engaging in decisive battles. Japanese units are strengthening their attacks on American bases on Leyte Island, the air force relay base on Morotai, and American naval supply units in Leyte Gulf. As the war report announced by the Imperial Japanese Headquarters on the 26th reveals, the intensity of the battles between the two armies is evident. Moreover, this massive attrition war and supply war will become increasingly intense as the situation develops.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese army previously launched a large-scale offensive against American forces between Carigara and Barugo in the northern part of Leyte Island, encircling them. They are now continuing to shrink the encirclement, engaging in fierce battles. As of the 25th, in order to reverse the situation, the enemy launched a fierce attack with sixty cannons on positions east of Carigara. The Japanese army utilized forests and high ground, engaging in close combat to repel the enemy. In the same area at sea, especially at a point about two kilometers southwest of Barugo, the enemy launched an attack from the right flank. The Japanese army has launched a large-scale annihilation battle against this and is currently achieving great results.</p>
<p>Manila, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new Japanese Air Force fighter "Toryu" (Dragon Slayer) bombed Bapa on Leyte Island on the 28th and strafed enemy ground units with machine guns, inflicting heavy damage. It also bombed enemy transport ships at sea in the area, sinking one large transport ship and one landing craft.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Reuters report on the 27th, American marine operations on Leyte Island have been virtually halted due to continuous heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Major Kambei and Others Promoted Two Ranks - Announcement by the Japanese Naval Ministry</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Major Kanji Kambei and twelve other brave warriors of the Japanese Navy fought bravely against the enemy in the sea battle off Rennell Island on January 29th and 30th of last year, inflicting heavy damage before heroically dying in action. It was previously announced to the entire army by the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet that they would be posthumously promoted by two ranks. The Japanese Naval Ministry announced the following on the 28th: The following officers are all promoted by two ranks. Naval Major Koji Hikai is promoted to Naval Captain.

<h3>Manto, Fugaku, Yasukuni, and Yaso - Combined Results of the Four Corps - Seventeen Enemy Ships Sunk or Destroyed</h3>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Record of an Interview with Minister Kusumoto</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>Mentioning Lieutenant General Jitsutaro Kusumoto, appointed as the Envoy of the Allied Nations stationed in Beijing, might not be unfamiliar to the average Shanghai resident. After the Incident, he once served as the head of the Shanghai Special Agency. Immediately after the establishment of the Asian Institute, he was reassigned as the Vice-Minister of the Central China Liaison Department of the Institute. Later, after the Allied forces landed in Mid-Western, he was also responsible for guiding the political revival of the Eastern Zhejiang region. Especially for the latter, he indeed established a good model of Sino-Japanese cooperation at that time, strictly cracking down on those ronin who wanted to take the opportunity to make a fortune. To this day, the people of Ningbo still remember it with gratitude. This time, the reporter was specially dispatched from this newspaper to the north, and it happened that he was hosting newspaper reporters in his capacity as the newly appointed minister. As a Shanghai resident, I certainly couldn't miss such an opportunity for a conversation.</p>
<p>Treating Chinese and Japanese Reporters Equally</p>
<p>Minister Kusumoto arrived in Peiping by plane on November 1st. In addition to meeting with important Chinese and Japanese figures from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM that afternoon, the first to be invited was the tea party for reporters from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM the next afternoon. This time, the invitation to newspaper reporters was limited to reporters only, regardless of nationality. Therefore, newspaper reporters from China, Japan, or other third countries could participate. This attitude of treating everyone equally had already made a good impression on the reporter. Secondly, ordinary gatherings are often scheduled for 4:30 PM, but you have to wait until at least 5:00 PM. However, today, Minister Kusumoto arrived at the meeting on time and showed a face full of spring breeze and a harmonious expression. I think the first reporter would not have a bad impression of him.</p>
<p>Returning to a Familiar Place After Twenty Years</p>
<p>After everyone was seated, Minister Kusumoto immediately opened his mouth and said, "Beijing is a place I visited twenty years ago. This time, I am taking office as Minister in the era of decisive battles and returning to my old homeland, I really feel like I have returned to my hometown." It turned out that Minister Kusumoto had served as an instructor at the Chinese Army University in Beijing twenty years ago, so he had a long-standing relationship with our country. In the anti-Japanese camp in Chongqing, many of his outstanding students are in it. According to Minister Kusumoto, if he now has the opportunity to have a cordial conversation with his group of students in the anti-Japanese camp, perhaps they would not be so obsessed. At this critical moment of the decisive battle, Minister Kusumoto's coming to North China, the base of the decisive battle, is naturally of extremely important significance. But he was very polite. He only stated that he would continue to emphasize the work of increasing production and transportation in North China, just like former Minister Shiozawa. At the same time, he expressed his gratitude to the 100 million officials and people in North China for seeing the success of past efforts in increasing production and transportation during this visit to North China.</p>
<p>Working Together in Unity and Solidarity</p>
<p>Before leaving Tokyo this time, he had listened to the opinions of Prime Minister Koiso and had already made up his mind to clarify the situation in China. However, before starting this work, he hoped to hear the opinions of both the Chinese and Japanese sides on the ground. Therefore, he humbly hoped that they could provide him with assistance in this task. He said that only with a clear and strong spirit can North China carry out the mission of a decisive battle base. He hopes that the people of China and Japan should truly work together in unity and solidarity, especially asking the local Japanese residents to understand this intention well. Therefore, his so-called clarification means that the Chinese and Japanese people should be harmoniously and seamlessly integrated into one. He said, "People often refer to China and Japan as brotherly countries, but in fact, the term brotherly relationship is not enough. I think this brotherly relationship should be expressed from the perspective of the same discipline. For example, when completing a certain task together, if this task is a specialty of the Chinese, then the Chinese are the younger brothers. Conversely, if a certain job is a specialty of the Japanese, then the Chinese are naturally also the little weaknesses!" The author can easily understand that with such a minister of the Allied Nations taking office in Beijing, the future politics of North China are naturally very promising.</p>
<p>Wartime Economy is the Most Complex</p>
<p>After Minister Kusumoto finished speaking, he waited for questions from the reporters. Most of the initial questions were raised by reporters from Japan and Manchukuo. After Minister Kusumoto inquired again humbly, a Chinese reporter finally raised his hand and asked: "Minister Kusumoto must have met with Chairman Wang. I wonder if you could tell us about his talk?" Minister Kusumoto replied immediately: "Due to the urgent time, there was no time to talk much." As for the questions from Japanese and Manchukuo reporters, the most important was the wartime economic policy. Minister Kusumoto considered this issue to be extremely complex. Based on his past experience in Shanghai and Ningbo, it seems that sometimes policies that are suitable for the general public in China will cause problems for the Japanese residents.</p>
<p>When it was almost six o'clock, Minister Kusumoto invited the reporters to the drawing room for light refreshments of champagne. At that time, the reporter happened to have the opportunity to talk to the minister. The reporter spoke first: "When Your Excellency the Minister was the President of the Victoria College in Shanghai, the reporter happened to be a professor at the college, so we may have already met!" After Minister Kusumoto received the reporter's business card, he nodded and smiled and asked about the situation of the Shen Bao. The reporter said, "It is a great honor for Guoguang in North China to see Your Excellency the Minister come to the ancient capital. I would like to extend the greetings of President Chen on behalf of him." Then, the reporter raised a question to ask him: "In the past, Your Excellency's style in Shanghai and Ningbo seemed to be different. I wonder what kind of great ambitions you have for this visit to North China?" The minister smiled and said: "The people of Central China are, after all, very sensitive. When I got off the plane and took a brief tour of the ancient capital, I felt that it was no different from twenty years ago." Just as Minister Kusumoto was talking eloquently, someone suddenly interjected, so the question I asked was never answered in the end! Fortunately, Section Chief Chongfu reported that when the minister has free time, we can visit him at any time in the future.</p>
<p>Concerned About China's News Industry</p>
<p>At this time, Mr. Hideo Umino, a special correspondent from the Allied Yomiuri Shimbun, came over to chat with me when he heard that I was a Shen Bao reporter. He asked me, "Is President Chen coming to the north too?" I said, "No." He then continued, "I was very grateful for President Chen's help when I was in Shanghai last time! I am very grateful!" From this, we can see the importance attached to our country's news industry by the Allied tradesmen. Soon, the bell rang at six o'clock, and everyone returned home with great interest.

<h3>Exhibition of Achievements by Scholarship Students</h3>
<p>Starting tomorrow (December 1st), we will hold an exhibition of achievements by students receiving the Shen Bao readers' scholarship at the Chinese YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge. These are all the results of the blood and sweat of the readers, and these are all the hard work of the many scholarship students. This is just the first step of demonstrating their academic achievements. In the future, after graduating and serving the country and the nation in society, the second step, the third step, and even countless achievements will be shown to the people of the country, creating a new situation for the future Republic of China. It is like planting flowers. The readers are all the garden owners, and the scholarship students are all the seeds of good flowers. We are just a small gardener. However, in just four years, under the guidance, encouragement, and care of the garden owners, we have collected many seeds of famous and rare flowers. If these seeds were not cherished by the garden owners, they might have been abandoned in the barren sand long ago, or even the ability to grow would have been impossible. Of course, there would be no talk of flowering and bearing fruit. Now, these seeds are fortunate to have been charged with the responsibility of watering and cultivating by the readers for the past four years, and under the care and guidance of all sectors of society in Shanghai, we gardeners have used our full spirit to support them, paying attention to them, watching them slowly germinate and grow, and step by step embarking on the road of flowering and bearing fruit. The joy in our hearts is truly indescribable. At the same time, we dare to say that the joy in the hearts of the garden owners is several times greater than ours. We dare to say that this is not only the joy of the garden owners, but the joy of the entire Shanghai people and the entire Republic of China.</p>
<p>These students, although they may not be our children, may not be the children of our relatives and friends, but our care for them surpasses that for our own children, because they are the children of the whole society, the children of the whole of China, and the foundation of the next generation of the Republic of China. No one should harm them, and no one should neglect them. We must pay twelve points of attention to the students' physical health, character, and academic performance. If there is even a slight negligence, we will have committed the greatest crime against the entire society and the entire China. This is our creed. Based on this creed, we continue to work tirelessly. How much can we achieve? We hope that you will guide us, and we are willing to ask for the most sincere, most frank criticism and guidance.</p>
<p>Alas, these poor and outstanding young people! How lovely, these compatriots of the new Republic of China! How respectable, the enthusiastic readers of the Shen Bao! From a thought, a gesture of the readers, accumulating little by little, has enabled thousands of talented young people to continue to make progress. A small cause can lead to such a great result. This can be said to be a miracle in modern China, and it is also the main spirit that has enabled our Republic of China to stand independently for five thousand years. From a thought in the readers' hearts, it can arouse the sympathy of many people and awaken everyone's mutual assistance. This proves that human minds are interconnected and that human instincts are mutual assistance.</p>
<p>The scholarship program is just a small manifestation of "interconnection" and "mutual assistance." Although this manifestation has only been around for a few years, it has already achieved considerable results, but this is only a minimum result. Looking around society, how many out-of-school youths are still unable to enjoy the right to education. Quietly think about it, under such circumstances, how much effort do the thousands of students currently receiving assistance need to make to continue to make progress so as not to fall short? We must continue to work hard. We must permanently create causes, and we will naturally be able to bear fruit permanently.</p>
<p>Appendix: Mr. Dai Yoshida's "Who is the Leader of the Chinese Revolution?" in the Weekly Review on the 26th is the first section. There is still a sequel to be published.</p>
<h3>Launching a Rapid Offensive, Japanese Troops Occupy Nandan, Advancing Towards Guiyang Along the Highway</h3>
<p>Guilin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a frontline Japanese military base in Guangxi, elite Japanese units are advancing forward. At 10:00 AM on the 28th, they occupied Southwest Nandan and Nandan Airport, capturing many Chongqing troops and seizing a number of locomotives, freight cars, and other military supplies. According to a frontline Japanese military base in Guangxi, after the rapid Japanese forces captured Nandan, the last stronghold in Guangxi, they continued to advance along the Southwest Highway and the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway towards Guiyang. A crowd of 50,000 Chongqing troops retreated in that direction, and the Japanese army continued to pursue. At noon on the 29th, they had advanced to a place eighteen kilometers north of Nandan, and were still continuing to launch a rapid offensive.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Battles in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>Frontline in Guizhou, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Chongqing troops in southern Guizhou are ordered to stop the Japanese army from advancing along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway and the highway front, and are putting up a desperate resistance. Fierce close combat battles have been launched north of Limingguan, a key point in the province, and within Guizhou Province north of Nandan.

<p>Guilin, 29th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese troops advancing north along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway broke into Guizhou Province on the 24th of this month. A reporter from the Guilin Ta Kung Pao, in April of this year, revealed the truth about the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway in that newspaper. The gist of it is introduced as follows: The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway starts from Liuzhou and ends at Dushan, with a total length of 394 kilometers, requiring 22 hours and 40 minutes. The railway equipment is very crude, so passengers feel very painful. Starting from Liuzhou, the road is full of uneven slopes. The cars often run on other railways. And, on average, one-third of them carry freight cars. Among them, the 60 kilometers from Guandong to Yating is the most difficult part of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway construction project. The area is more than 600 meters above sea level. There are about ten rocky caves above and below the ground. The situation when the rocky caves were developed, as well as the tens of thousands of workers mobilized for the embankment construction project. In addition, there are many curved valleys, and the project is also very difficult. Dushan, the terminal of the railway, is a plateau area 900 meters above sea level. Since the opening of the railway, it has become an important transportation hub and the political center of the southern part of Guizhou Province. In the canteen of the Guiguan Hotel inside the military station, people from Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries are often seen. The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway has great military significance. As for when it will be directly connected to Guiyang in the future, its economic value will be greatly developed.</p>

<h3>Fourth Anniversary of the Three-Nation Declaration: China, Japan, and Manchukuo Closely Cooperate to Further Jointly Promote the Great Undertaking of Reviving Asia</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Today (30th) marks the fourth anniversary of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. At this critical juncture of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, its significance is deeply felt. Four years ago, when the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo was issued, although the situation in East Asia was fraught with crises, the war had not yet broken out, and the dangerous situation could still be salvaged. The issuance of the joint declaration by the three nations was intended to resolve the root causes of Sino-Japanese disputes and seek peace in East Asia. However, in December of the following year, due to the United States' insistence on its aggressive designs in East Asia, the Greater East Asia War finally erupted. Since then, the situation in East Asia has undergone a complete transformation. In January of the 32nd year (1943), our nation joined the war. Consequently, the task before us was not only to achieve comprehensive peace but also to cooperate in the war to ensure lasting peace and defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. The significance of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo was thus further enhanced. The original intention of the declaration evolved from mutual cooperation and joint pursuit of prosperity to close collaboration to devote all efforts to the war to defeat the enemy and defend East Asia.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, our nation suffered the misfortune of Chairman Wang's passing, losing its leader and the people their guide. Amid our grief and mourning, as we commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Three-Nation Declaration, we recall that this time last year was just the first month after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and less than a month after the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Chairman Wang, upon returning to Nanjing from an inspection in Shanghai, delivered a speech, stating that the foundation for strengthening amicable relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo was the cornerstone for establishing the axis on the East Asian continent and the basis for the unity and cooperation of all nations in Greater East Asia. Now, we have the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, with both sharing the same spirit and will. The fundamental principles of mutual trust, mutual assistance, co-existence, and co-prosperity among East Asian nations are even more evident, and the scope of the co-prosperity sphere is even more expanded. From now on, we must base ourselves on the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo and adhere to the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration to strengthen the East Asian axis and strive for the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the realization of the common vision of Greater East Asia. Chairman Wang did not live to see the realization of his ideals and passed away suddenly. To fulfill Chairman Wang's legacy, we must follow his instructions, cooperate closely with our allies, and advance bravely to promote the spirit of the Three-Nation Joint Declaration and complete the co-prosperity construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the occasion of the fourth anniversary of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, Foreign Minister Li issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: The joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, which laid the cornerstone for East Asian unity, has now reached its fourth anniversary. At this critical juncture of the Greater East Asia decisive battle, looking back on the Three-Nation Joint Declaration that was sworn to the world and laid the permanent cornerstone for the revival of Asia, one cannot but feel deeply grateful. Since the issuance of the joint declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo, China and Manchukuo have exchanged ambassadors and officially recognized each other. Subsequently, the National Government, through the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, resolutely declared war on the United States and Britain. Thus, China, Japan, and Manchukuo, under the same goal, moved forward on the path of jointly destroying the United States and Britain and revitalizing East Asia. As the war is now facing a decisive battle, the heavy responsibility of reviving Asia should be shouldered jointly by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. In the future, we must further closely cooperate, move forward in step, and achieve the great undertaking of reviving Asia.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - November 30th marks the fourth anniversary of the declaration by China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Embassy in Nanjing will hold a commemorative ceremony in the embassy's conference hall at 10:00 a.m. on that day. Acting Ambassador Zhang is also scheduled to visit our National Government and the Japanese Embassy that morning to extend congratulations.</p>

Between the Saar Canal and the Rhine River, the German rearguard continues to fight against the advancing right wing of the US Third Army and the left wing of the US Seventh Army to protect the German main force retreating to the new positions. A part of the US Seventh Army that entered Strasbourg in the Alsace region and the tank team of the French First Army in the Mulhouse area are launching a pincer offensive, continuing to exert pincer pressure on the high and low ground of Vosges and the plain of the upper reaches of the Rhine River, but were contained after fierce fighting yesterday.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle in the Cologne Plain</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The fierce battle on the Cologne plain on the Western Front is becoming more intense. According to reports from Paris, the German army is currently concentrating a large force in the area and dispatching its most elite reserve forces, so the Allied offensive has stalled northeast of Aachen. Several American divisions attempted to break into the Ruhr area and, after sufficient artillery preparation, are now launching another large-scale attack, but were repulsed by the German army. According to a London dispatch, the US Ninth Army in the area has now reached the banks of the Ruhr River, the last key point in the defense of Cologne. The US Third Army has advanced to a point ten kilometers from the city of Saarbrucken but has been blocked by the German army.</p>

What is most noteworthy is that the British news specifically listed several points: (1) The explosive force was unprecedentedly intense, and the sound of the explosion continued for several hours. (2) The huts and buildings have disappeared without a trace. (3) Nearby factories and buildings have been destroyed, and buildings miles away have also been damaged.</p>
<h3>Adhering to Chairman's Legacy: Open Letter to the People by the Chinese Nationalist Party (2)</h3>
<p>Our party is a revolutionary party of the Three Principles of the People, so it must have a strong organization, strict discipline, and rigorous training, so that party members can fight for the cause, and party members must be able to devote themselves to the cause, and be able to go deep into the people in the future, so that the Three Principles of the People can be popularized among the masses. It is also necessary to make the Three Principles of the People popular among the people, so that we can unite the entire nation, unify our will, and cultivate our forward-looking creativity, so as to fight against the opposing forces and aggressive forces, and establish an independent and free modern country. In the spring of the thirteenth year (1924), our Premier convened the First National Congress and reorganized the party, launching a broad mass movement, the fundamental spirit of which lies here. During the eighteenth and nineteenth years (1929-1930), our Chairman strongly advocated the great cause of protecting the party and saving the country, "restoring democratic centralization in the party, and realizing democratic politics in the country," the main task of which also lies here.</p>
<p>What makes the revolutionary party of the Great Three Principles of the People different from ordinary political parties is that it can select the most outstanding and progressive elements from the democratic masses as the vanguard of the revolution, that it can organize the masses, lead the masses, and be a viable and lasting revolutionary team, that it can motivate the masses, train the masses, and establish a broad and concentrated democratic force, and use this force to devote itself to the revolutionary struggle, and devote itself to the application and preservation of revolutionary power. The purpose of the revolutionary struggle is to establish revolutionary power, and this power will be returned to the revolutionary productive masses, entrusted to the revolutionary productive masses, and will belong to the revolutionary productive masses. It cannot be borrowed by a small number of warlords, bureaucrats, and politicians. The revolutionary party members who bear the heavy responsibility of revolutionary midwives should do their best, select the wise and capable, accept the entrustment of the people, and exercise their governing power. This is the essence of the revolutionary masses, and also an essential element of the anti-feudal struggle.</p>
<p>Party Members Go Deep into the People to Promote Work</p>
<p>Our Chairman expounded the legacy and gave detailed instructions, saying that the formation of revolutionary forces is: "The real meaning of revolution lies in awakening the oppressed majority of the people at the lower levels, so that they can engage in political struggles to obtain political achievements, so as to relieve suffering and increase happiness." "If we want the majority of the people to engage in political struggles, we must first unite the most enlightened elements among them, so that they can be trained and organized, and become capable fighters, so that they can lead the general masses and actively participate in political struggles. This kind of unity is what is called a party, and this kind of fighter is what is called a party member." As for the relationship between party rule and civil rights, he "advocates giving equal emphasis to implementing party rule and cultivating civil rights," and "for the enlightened elements, we should give them the freedom to develop their activity ability, and for the unenlightened elements, we should also encourage them, so that their activity ability can be gradually developed freely." "The people's freedoms of speech, assembly, and publication must be given practical guarantees." He also said: "The party cannot be high above the people," but should "go deep into the people," so party members must never become a "special class" above the masses, but "do guiding work and promoting work within the people," so that the people's strength will gradually be enriched, gradually expanded, and truly able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of the national revolution. This is the duty of every party member. "Only in this way can we be comrades, otherwise we are enemies, only in this way can we be the vanguard of the people, otherwise we are traitors of the people." His words are so profound and famous. He deeply felt that the spirit of democratic centralization had been forgotten after the passing of the Premier, and the democratic forces had not been established, which would make the revolution change its nature and the people lose their faith.</p>
<p>Uniting National Patriots to Jointly Clean Up the Situation</p>
<p>Before the incident in the twenty-sixth year (1937), he repeatedly explained that democratic politics is the foundation for uniting the people, "The more political freedom given to the people in peacetime, the easier it will be to cope with in case of an emergency, because the country is formed by the collection of people, and the people's political ability is strong, so the country's strength is also strong." "It is the essence that the government and the people depend on each other for life when dealing with national disasters, the government is loyal to the people, and the people trust their government is their active activity." "China today is in the midst of internal and external troubles, and only by basing ourselves on the common interests of the entire nation and the entire nation can we seek unity and establish a strong foundation." In the declaration of the Sixth National Congress of our party in the twenty-eighth year (1939), he solemnly announced again, "Except for the Communist Party, all people have the freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication, and our party is willing to unite all patriots and factions with sincerity to jointly shoulder the responsibility of cleaning up the situation." "Only a sound democratic organization can have agile centralized action, so free will and discipline should be given equal importance. Only in this way can the party concentrate its will and concentrate its strength, only in this way can the party continuously absorb elements with independent opinions and free thoughts, so that we can all take responsibility, and when things happen, we can have a real understanding and resolute action." Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in the thirtieth year (1941), he launched the New National Movement Program at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of our party, as a guideline for organizing the people and training the youth. "First popularize it among the general comrades, so as to be the vanguard, and then popularize it among the general compatriots, so as to form the gold and soup pool of the Republic of China." To shoulder the new mission of "defending the great war in East Asia." This is the experience of our Chairman leading the anti-feudal thing after the death of the Premier. All our comrades and our compatriots should inherit the legacy and implement it to the end.</p>
<p>The Policies of Tolerating Communists and Separating Communists Were Used in the Beginning Without Any Difference</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year (1924), our party was reorganized, and the policy of tolerating Communists was decided at the same time. However, reorganization is one thing, and tolerating Communists is another. The spirit of reorganization has been described above, and the Premier has carefully discussed the policy of tolerating Communists at the First National Congress, so that the general new youth with ideas can recognize the Three Principles of the People as a national revolution and fight together, so as not to go astray. Therefore, the joining of Communist Party members into our party is to "change Communist Party members into Kuomintang members." Our party's tolerance of Communist Party members is not to "change the Kuomintang into a Communist Party." Not only that, on January 26 of the twelfth year (1923), our Premier and Lenin's representative Yuefei issued a joint declaration, the first article of which clearly pointed out that "Communist organizations, even the Soviet system, cannot in fact be applied to China," "Mr. Yuefei completely agrees with this view." Therefore, our party's tolerance of Communist Party members is to recognize that "China does not have the conditions for the success of Communist organizations or the Soviet system." The joining of Communist Party members into our party also recognizes that "the most important and urgent problem in China is the success of the unity of the Republic of China and the acquisition of complete national independence." Not only that, the national revolution takes imperialism as its object, "so it is necessary to awaken all the people oppressed by imperialism to engage in the national revolution," "and it cannot be successful by specializing in one class." Therefore, the so-called tolerance of Communists depends entirely on whether they can jointly devote themselves to the national revolution. From the tolerance of Communists in the thirteenth year (1924) to the separation of Communists in the sixteenth year (1927), the policies were used in the beginning without any difference. After the separation of Communists, the Communist Party's atrocities of harming the country and harming the people became increasingly obvious. Their "propaganda of the land policy at the end is purely the face of Zhang Xianzhong and Li Zicheng, and their killing and arson are the inevitable results of the raw swallowing and live peeling method," which is still the case today. After the September 18th Incident, our party comrades, from all over the country, united sincerely under the slogan of "seeking unification through construction and seeking co-governance through equal rights," and re-established the situation of unification. Although the worries were deep, there was still something to be done in national affairs. However, the Communist Party members harbored evil intentions and used external propaganda to incite internal chaos. During the Battle of Shanghai, the government transferred the Jiangxi army to support, and the Communist bandits attacked Fuzhou. During the Battle of Gubeikou, the government transferred the Yangtze River army to support, and the Communist bandits broke Fuzhou and attacked Nanchang. Therefore, after the thirty-second year (1943), the central government made the decision that "the most urgent task is to eliminate the Communist bandits, and the most urgent task to cure the root cause is to promote production and construction." Indeed, the bandit atmosphere is wanton, and the disease is in the heart. If we do not eradicate its roots and fight its fierce flames, then all plans, internal and external, will not be able to start. In the midst of advancing the suppression of Communists politically and militarily, the remnants of the Communist bandits are increasingly impoverished, just like fish in a cauldron. Initially, the Xi'an Incident was not expected to be revived, and at this time, our Chairman reiterated that "there should be a determined determination to prevent Communists," severely criticized the error of the so-called "people's front," and in the declaration of the Third Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee of our party, he analyzed the difference between the Principle of People's Livelihood and Communism in order to prevent the conspiracy of the Communist Party members and to eliminate the short-sightedness of the defeatists. However, before several months had passed, the incident had occurred, and the national vitality was increasingly mourned, and the international conspiracy was becoming more and more serious. If we do not resign earlier, the situation will be even worse. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Special Attack Units of the Japanese Army Demonstrate Glorious Results; Director Izubuchi Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Director Izubuchi of the Shanghai Army Reporting Department of the Allied Japanese Army delivered a speech at the regular meeting of reporters at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (29th), announcing the magnificent battle results of the special attack units of the Japanese Army and Navy. He also clarified that the Japanese Army, loyal, brave, righteous, and tolerant of all difficulties, is promoting righteous warfare in the continental operations, reflecting the glorious results of the special attack units. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>The Majestic Power of the Kamikaze Remains Unwavering</p>
<p>Regarding the Philippine Islands war situation, the Japanese Army's special attack units, Wanduo Unit, Tomi Unit, and Hachiko Unit, echoed each other, achieving great battle results, establishing a strong determination, and vowing to completely destroy the enemy, the United States and Britain, and never stop until the final victory is achieved. Therefore, when the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit launched an attack last time, it had already achieved magnificent and great results. After the battle results were announced, many Japanese nationals eagerly volunteered to join the special attack unit. This enthusiastic spirit continues to be discovered, inheriting the legacy of the martyrs and giving a greater blow to the enemy, the United States and Britain. As long as there are traces of enemy American ships in the Pacific Ocean, the work of the special attack unit will continue to attack. The Japanese side has this special power, which has not yet been activated and is calmly dealing with the enemy.</p>
<p>Continental Frontline Continues to Advance</p>
<p>The incomparably loyal and brave actions of the Japanese special attack unit members have made the enemy frightened and the world amazed. However, the spirit of the Japanese army's special attack units to move forward and follow each other is even more inspiring, and every soldier in those operations has the same determination as the special attack unit members and is actively working on the battlefield. At the same time, in terms of continental operations, after the Japanese army completely occupied Guilin and Liuzhou, the largest and most important base of the enemy's US air force, it continued to pursue and attack the defeated enemy army, overcoming the difficulties of Guangxi's mountain peaks and natural dangers, and working hard in battle. It has already occupied Nanning and advanced into Guizhou Province. The difficult and arduous fierce battle continues to advance, enduring all difficulties and promoting righteous warfare. Its actions are in fact mutually shining with the spirit of the special attack unit. Only this kind of Japanese army's loyal, brave, and righteous spirit is the guarantee of Japan's vast combat power, and it is also the guarantee of the victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive Ration Coupons to be Extended and Generally Issued</h3>
<p>The city's Materials Allocation Office originally scheduled to issue comprehensive ration coupons Nos. 61 to 90, starting yesterday (29th), at the 1st to 19th issuing offices (i.e., within the old Zones 1 to 8 and the Nanshi District), sequentially according to the property tax and the scheduled date on the application. Because there are still many comprehensive ration coupons held by citizens for items that have not been received, it has been decided to postpone the issuance, and the date will be announced by the office after it is determined.</p>
<h3>Household Coal Briquettes to be Replaced with Coal Dust</h3>
<p>Because of electricity issues, it is difficult for coal briquette manufacturing plants in this city to manufacture them, so the allocation of household coal briquettes will be changed to allocate coal or coal dust. The city's Materials Allocation Office is actively preparing for this.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Deputy Director of the Economic Security Office</h3>
<p>The position of Deputy Director of the Police Economic Security Office of this city was originally held concurrently by Yao Yunbo, Deputy Director of the Special High School. Because Deputy Director Yao's duties at the Special High School are heavy and he cannot take care of both, he has been relieved of his concurrent position as Deputy Director of the office. The vacancy has been filled by Yamaguchi Heijiro, a specialist of the office, and he has been working since the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Installation of Alarm Bells in the Huashan and Changning Districts</h3>
<p>The Huashan and Changning District Baojia Committees previously consulted with the Football Federation on holding a football match to raise funds for the installation of alarm bells in the district. The bidding process has been completed, costing more than 15 million yuan. The contract has now been signed and work has begun to install the latest type of alarm bells in Shanghai, which is beneficial for police defense.</p>
<h3>Special Tax on Cattle and Poultry to be Collected Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The municipal government has investigated the fact that cattle and poultry (including chickens, ducks, geese, etc.) are a major part of the city's food sales. The special business tax on cattle and poultry will be collected starting tomorrow (1st), and after investigating the recent market value of cattle in this city, the tax will be 5 percent, which is 2,000 yuan. The remaining chickens, ducks, geese, etc. will be taxed at 5 percent based on the monthly business figures of each wholesale business, which will be handled by the Special Tax Collection Office for Livestock Business.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Famous Porcelain of Past Dynasties to Close Today</h3>
<p>The First Exhibition of Famous Porcelain of Past Dynasties, sponsored by the Chinese Art Museum, has attracted more than 20 groups of visitors, as well as thousands of distinguished people from the East and West, since its opening, creating an unprecedented grand occasion. In order to implement the purpose of promoting ancient art and promoting the national spirit, the museum has hired contemporary archaeologists and collectors to actively prepare for the second exhibition, so as to provide us with a study of the origin of the production of our ancestors, and also to examine the traces of mild evolution, the significance of which is not only for appreciation and research. The first exhibition of famous porcelain has many rare treasures, which is a great opportunity for appreciation. Because the value is too great, it is scheduled to close at 4:00 p.m. today and will not be extended.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Justice Orders to Establish Protection Association for Released Prisoners</h3>
<p>In order to prevent prisoners from committing crimes again after their release, the Ministry of Justice has specially ordered all subordinate procuratorates to quickly plan and establish protection associations for released prisoners as soon as possible, so as to urge released prisoners to correct their mistakes and start anew. After receiving the order, the High Procuratorate of this city immediately instructed the local procuratorate to actively prepare for the establishment.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Firms Re-register</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs and Food Bureaus have both been abolished successively. All factories and firms that have registered and obtained certificates are considered valid. However, for the convenience of statistics and supervision, the Municipal Economic Bureau will conduct re-registration from now until December 20th. The Municipal Economic Bureau will issue new registration certificates free of charge, so that all are consistent.</p>
<h3>Notification from Trade Association Secretariat: Members Should Not Seek Profiteering</h3>
<p>The secretariats of the various trade associations in this city held a symposium at the Municipal Economic Bureau the other day to discuss issues such as commodity prices. They advised all members not to engage in speculative price increases, especially the illegal price increases of oil and candles after the enemy aircraft attacked Shanghai in the middle of this month. This is extremely abhorrent, and it is hoped that all members will cherish themselves in the future. If there is any profiteering behavior taking advantage of the situation, the authorities will severely punish them.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on the 21st: Over 300 Civilian Casualties</h3>
<p>As a result of the enemy aircraft's indiscriminate bombing of Shanghai on the 21st of this month, after an investigation by the Air Defense Headquarters, as of the 28th, the total number of Chinese civilian casualties was approximately 300 (with about one-third of them dead). The municipal authorities hope that the general public will, in the future, cooperate with air defense measures during air raids. Investigations have revealed that the victims of this air raid were all innocent Chinese civilians. This proves that indiscriminate bombing is neither planned nor discriminate. Citizens should understand the tragedy of this incident. In the future, when enemy aircraft attack, they must thoroughly implement light control and refrain from looking up in the streets when the anti-aircraft guns are firing to ensure their safety.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Wu Quanlai's Western Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhaotong</p>
<p>The continuous decline of the Shanghai art scene is an undeniable fact. This is because what most young people engaged in painting know is either the well-practiced techniques of modeling or the pursuit of sensation and taste. But the result is that the former becomes a superficial and mediocre so-called realism, which is in fact nothing more than a vulgar technique without a voice. The latter only cares about the momentary pleasure of the producer but neglects the accuracy of basic depiction, and thus returns to emptiness and superficiality.</p>
<p>The works in Quanlai's exhibition include the crystallizations of his research over the past decade. Seeing each of his oil paintings or sketches will make you discover that he is searching for a way out everywhere. No, he is trying various new techniques, whether in conception, brushstrokes, color, or position. Superficially, each painting has its own characteristics. After seeing No. 55 "Still Life" and No. 54 "Canna," you will believe that this statement is more reasonable. However, his art is, after all, built on a solid foundation, so it can also be said that it is completely consistent in essence, because there are also paintings such as No. 40 "Remote Return" and No. 7 "Vase" that can be studied by the author.</p>
<p>Excellent and lively modern art requires the use of modeling techniques as a means and the expression of sensation and taste as a goal. This is precisely the significance of Mr. Hai Su's enthusiastic sponsorship of this exhibition, and it is also a measure to correct the current malpractices.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Review Committee to Hold First Standing Meeting Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The first meeting of the Standing Committee of the Materials Control Review Committee was originally scheduled to be held in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to review the recent control operations of the National Commercial Control Federation and the control committees for rice, flour, wheat, oil, grain, cotton, daily necessities, etc., and to further strengthen the control matters. However, due to insufficient preparations, it was postponed. It is now learned that the various control committees have drafted detailed reports on the control work after their reorganization and submitted them to the meeting. It is expected that the meeting will be held early next month, and Committee Chairman Zhou Fohai and Minister Chen Changjun of the Ministry of Industry are determined to attend in person.</p>

Hualian took the lead all the way, playing steadily, especially the forward Que Li was outstanding. Tongren won against Huaying 35-31. At halftime, the score was 22-17. Huaying lost regrettably.

<h3>Naval Seamen Training Center Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday; Merchant Seamen Training School Held Ceremony Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The Central Seamen Training Center of the Ministry of Navy and the Central Merchant Seamen Training School began training the eleventh term of naval recruits and the first term of ordinary seamen in June of this year. Through the efforts of all officers and men under the leadership of the director, and with the assistance of Allied navies, the results have been remarkable. A joint graduation ceremony was held at the school on Bansongyuan Road, Shanghai, at 10:00 AM yesterday (29th). Forty-five of the 142 graduating recruits were selected for advanced studies, and an opening ceremony was held for special training soldiers in artillery, steering, machinery, and signals. At the same time, 98 graduating seamen were assigned to the China Branch Shipping Company, East Asia Shipping Company, China Steamship Company, and Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company for internships. The ceremony was presided over by the director, Major General Huang Xun, and the training director, Colonel Yang Zheren. The details of the ceremony are described below:</p>
<p>Ceremony Begins</p>
<p>The ceremony began at 10:10 AM. The officials present included the representative of the Minister of Navy, Major General Chen Ruiming, Director of the Military Balance Department of the Ministry of Navy, Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, Principal of the Central Naval Academy, Colonel Zhang Binying, Director of Education, Major General Ye Kesong, Director of the Hydrographic Office of the Ministry of Navy, Lieutenant General Xu Fuqin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Navy, and the Allied officials, Lieutenant General Maeda Minoru, Chief Military Advisor of the Navy of the National Government, Rear Admiral Minato Keijo, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Fleet of the Chinese side and Chief Naval Attaché in Shanghai, Rear Admiral Mori Tokuji, Commander of the Aftermath Base of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces, Colonel Miyasaka, Chief Instructor of the Central Naval Academy, Major Morita, Instructor, and dozens of others. Director Huang presided over the ceremony, and the ceremony was performed as usual. The director entrusted the graduates of the eleventh term of naval recruits and the first term of seamen, entrusted the special training soldiers of each department, and awarded graduation certificates and prizes to the graduates of this term.</p>
<p>Director's Speech</p>
<p>The director then delivered a speech, saying: "Although the navy and shipping are different in name, their missions are the same. The responsibility of merchant ships in wartime is as great as that of the navy. The Allied navies win every battle, which is due to the bravery of the officers and men, but it is also due to the rapid transportation and the spirit of sacrifice of the seamen. After the National Government returned to the capital, the highest authorities were determined to build a unified and strong navy. The graduates trained by this school include 11 terms of recruits and special training soldiers, 8 terms of artillery and machinery, 9 terms of steering, and 10 terms of signals. They are now serving in fleets or agencies with good results. Today's graduates are all excellent members who have received strict training. They should do their best to protect the country and the people, and to revitalize East Asia. We should also learn from the naval spirit of our ally Japan, and earnestly follow the training instructions for soldiers of the army, navy, and air force prescribed by the late Chairman Wang, and the exhortations of all officers, and live up to my expectations of you."</p>
<p>Maeda's Congratulatory Remarks</p>
<p>Then, Chief Advisor Lieutenant General Maeda delivered a congratulatory speech, saying: "I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in the graduation ceremony. Under the cultivation of the director and all the instructors, the recruits and seamen of this term have graduated today with excellent results and will be assigned to various places to serve. I sincerely express my congratulations. Various special training soldiers are selected from the graduates and hone deeper academic skills as the backbone of the implementation unit. This time you have the opportunity to receive special training, which is really commendable in the Chinese navy. I hope you will understand the significance and strive to encourage each other. At present, the world war situation is entering a decisive stage in the East and West. Our East Asian nations should unite, gather the total strength of the East Asian nations, break the enemy's dreams, and lay the foundation for the permanent stability of the Greater East Asia. In the future, whether you are serving in the military or serving outside, you must cultivate the cultivation of the military spirit and the Tao of the seaman's soul, grasp the true posture of the current war, and hope that you will keep your duty and move towards the bright road." Subsequently, Minister Chen gave instructions on behalf of the Minister of Navy, with many encouraging words. The graduating recruits and seamen were very excited. Finally, the graduating recruit representative Wu Wei and the graduating seaman representative Ni Zhongkai gave speeches in reply, and the ceremony was completed. In the afternoon, the 98 graduating seamen, led by the staff of the various shipping companies to which they were assigned, left the school in three motor vehicles. All the officers and men lined up to bid farewell at the school's pier, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic and everyone was very happy.</p>

<h3>The Problem of School Classes After Air Raids and Electricity Conservation</h3>
<p>— Lin Wencai</p>
<p>Because of the previous air raids, there have been many discussions about the issue of students attending classes, and there has been no consensus. At the same time, "another power outage" has been implemented. Because electricity conservation is a general and universal issue, it has a great indirect impact on students' evening self-study work. At the same time, the opinions I provide are also related, so they are discussed together.</p>
<p>My opinion is provided to the municipal education authorities. I hope that it will be promulgated by order to achieve a unified effect. -- To save space, I will omit the theory and focus on practical solutions.</p>
<p>(A) All schools in the city should adopt a half-day class system uniformly. The method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) From 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, there are six classes. Each class is 40 minutes, and each class rests for 10 minutes, for a total of 300 minutes, which is equal to 5 hours.</p>
<p>(2) Schools should reduce the amount of morning exercises if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Art, handicrafts, music, and other subjects should appropriately reduce teaching time, and each school should guide students in free extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>(4) If an air raid alarm is issued in the morning, in addition to the classes that have already started, the school should be responsible for handling the situation in accordance with the air defense regulations. If a warning alarm is issued before 8:00 AM, parents should immediately stop their children from going to school.</p>
<p>(5) If the alarm is lifted before 1:00 PM, each school should make up the morning lessons in the afternoon (the method should be the same as in the morning). After this method is determined, each school should notify the parents in advance, without having to inform them temporarily.</p>
<p>(6) In the event of a full-day alarm, each school should make full use of "Sundays" or "Saturday afternoons" to make up for the courses of that day.</p>
<p>(7) After the method is announced, all public and private schools in the city should follow it uniformly, so as to avoid time conflicts for part-time teachers.</p>
<p>(B) All students' parents should be notified to earnestly supervise their children in accordance with the following items:</p>
<p>(1) If you hear an alarm on the road, you should immediately look for a shelter, or if you are closer to home, quickly fold back home. If you are not far from the school, you can still run to the school for shelter.</p>
<p>(2) After leaving school every day, you should immediately return home and try to complete the self-study work or homework that should be done that day in the afternoon, and you don't need to do self-study in the evening.</p>
<p>(3) Patrol children, practice going to bed early and getting up early, make full use of daytime working hours, minimize games and rest, concentrate your mind, and cope with the most difficult situation.</p>
<p>The above methods are briefly described. If the authorities quickly adopt them and order their implementation in a timely manner, the studies and lives of young students in the face of air raids and electricity conservation will surely be improved in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Regarding the Company's Layoff Problem, Report Opinions Factually, He Sumin</p>
<p>In the issue of this month's 23rd, there was an article by Li Liangru, "Contributing Some Opinions on the Company's Layoff Problem," which was reasonable and in line with the actual situation.</p>
<p>A friend of mine works in a large printing house in this city. Yesterday, he mentioned that the library had issued a notice this month and formulated two methods, A and B. Method A is to keep the job without working. From next month, you can not go to the company to work. The company will pay the full salary and subsidies for November every month (the lowest salary and subsidies currently earned by the library's employees are more than 9,000 yuan) until September next year. The original position is still reserved, and the company will temporarily notify you to return to the company to work according to business needs. Method B is retirement. The company will pay a one-time retirement salary and subsidies for 10 months. Any employee who voluntarily applies to the company to handle Method A or B this month can do so. If you do not apply this month, you will continue to work as usual from next month. According to the library's method, it coincides with the first point of Li's opinion, and it is more thoughtful.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Nianxi's Charity Sale of Fox Fur to Aid Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>A letter from Mr. Zhou Nianxi states: "Respected Sirs, Nianxi, shielded by ancestral blessings, is not exposed to cold or starvation. Since the events [likely referring to a recent disaster or war], my dwelling has been reduced to ruins, and I live in a humble dwelling in Shanghai. I practice frugality and contentment with my lot, but every time winter arrives and I see people freezing to death on the streets, I can only feel deep sorrow and compassion. Recently, I saw that your organization is holding a winter disaster relief and emergency aid drive to help those in danger and need, and I deeply sympathize with this cause. Therefore, I dare to urge my whole family to further reduce expenses. Besides the donations I have already made, I still feel I have not done enough. I am donating an item of clothing bestowed upon me by my late father, namely a fox fur satin jacket and a gray squirrel satin robe, to your organization to be sold, with all proceeds to be used for winter disaster relief. I hope you will appreciate my sincere intentions and not hesitate to go through the necessary procedures to make this a success, so that I can fulfill my wish to provide as much assistance as possible. I will be endlessly grateful for your kindness."</p>
<p>Furthermore, as the weather grows colder, the Salvation Army's porridge kitchen plans to set up a soup kitchen and distribute winter clothing as usual. After special consultation with this newspaper, we jointly launch a winter relief effort to provide porridge and clothing. We continue to appeal to people from all walks of life to assist with enthusiasm, saving money to rescue the hungry and cold, accumulating small contributions into a large fund to collectively engage in this charitable act.</p>
<h3>Voluntary Reform and Anti-Smoking - Ninth Session Concluded</h3>
<p>The voluntary reform and anti-smoking program organized by the South Tonglu Moral Education Association, under special agreement with this newspaper, has concluded its ninth group smoking cessation session yesterday. The graduating members left the facility, and a farewell ceremony was held in the association's auditorium. The atmosphere was solemn. First, the supervisor, Huang Jingqi, delivered a speech, followed by Wang Huishan, Wang Xiutong, Xu Xiuxing, and doctors Cai Daming, Yang Yusheng, and Shao Bonan, who offered earnest words of encouragement. Afterwards, a representative of the former smokers gave a speech of thanks, stating that the reason for falling into the habit of smoking was partly due to boredom and partly due to pain. Sometimes various stimuli were present, which led to the relief of emotional frustrations and resulted in addiction. Now, thanks to Shen Bao [this newspaper] and the Moral Education Association, and the sincere care of the doctors, they have been able to reach the other shore within ten days, a transformation akin to bringing the dead back to life. They vowed that after leaving the hospital, they would never try smoking again. Everyone applauded in approval, and the gathering dispersed after lunch.</p>
<p>Lectures</p>
<p>Lecture on Unemployment Relief: In response to the needs of the times, this newspaper initiated a series of lectures on unemployment relief for young people.

All are welcome to attend, no tickets required.</p>
<p>Seeking Experienced Seamstresses: The YWCA West Shanghai Service Center plans to hire two or three seamstresses or tailors, regardless of gender, with the condition that they are proficient in sewing men's and women's silk and cloth long robes, and they must have a reputable guarantor.

<h3>Donations to the Child Welfare Association - Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association is currently caring for over 300 orphaned and impoverished children. Due to soaring prices, expenses are enormous and far exceed the budget. Leading figures in the city's society have jointly discussed fundraising methods. At the scene, Luo Hongyi, Chen Binsu, and others pledged to raise over 2.5 million yuan as an initiative. The association has now received the following donations from this pledged amount: Wang Zhenchuan, 200,000 yuan; Zhang Xiangwen, 180,000 yuan; Lin Kanghou, 120,000 yuan; Wu Yunqi and Ding Boxiong, 110,000 yuan each; Le Fucheng, 103,000 yuan; Zhao Jinqing and Fang Yunzhen, 20,000 yuan each. The enthusiasm of Mr. Luo and others in providing relief and benefiting children is truly commendable and deeply appreciated. However, given the continued rapid rise in current prices, even if the fundraising target of 5 million yuan is met, whether it will be sufficient to cover the expenses for the second half of the year is still questionable. Therefore, we urgently hope that enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life will send in any funds raised as soon as possible, so that the association can purchase food, fuel, and other necessities in advance for storage and use to ensure long-term sustainability. If you would like to make a donation, in addition to direct collection by the association (No. 208, Central Huai Building, Dashanghai Road), the social service department of this newspaper can also collect on their behalf. Telephone donations are especially welcome; please call 82273, and the association will send someone to collect the donation with a receipt.</p>
