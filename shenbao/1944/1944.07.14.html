<p>社評</p>
<h3>喚起防空常識</h3>
<p>近月來本市不時發出警戒警報及空襲警報，我們認為一有警報聲作，就市民立塲，應不問是演習，或是眞的空襲，必須遵守防空當局所指示的防空規則，準備一切實施工作。不要以為是演習，而大意不顧；不要以為是眞空襲，而　驚惶無措。演習時當作眞空襲，則可養成防空的習慣，萬一眞的空襲時，才能鎮靜防避，减少損害。</p>
<p>我們是參戰國家，上海是參戰國家的都市，而且是後方經濟中心的重要都市，所以，上海地方在客觀上的地位，毋寗說是為敵方施以空襲的目標。因此，我們認為敵機空襲上海是可能的事。當然，更不是說敵機旦晚來襲，搖惑人心。我們是說，目前上海所處的地位環境，遭受敵機空襲是料想中事。為减少空襲時生命財產的損害，我們必須接受當局的防空指導，遵照防空規則，鎮靜以處。</p>
<p>可是，觀於歷次防空演習，以及實施長期燈火管制以後的成績而言，大部分市民中具有兩種心理，一種是迷信也是僥倖心理，他們認為敵機有種種「理由」，不會空襲上海的，這是迷信。或者盲目地希望上海不致遭受空襲，這是僥倖。因而對於防空規則漠不關心。一種是糊塗心理，他們根本不知空襲的性質如何？根本不知注意防空對於空襲時發生效用如何？所以，對於防空規則茫然無知，甚且在實施防空規則時，發生與平時不同之情形，認為不便而加以詛咒。這兩種心理，在目前決戰時期的戰時都市中，實在是要不得的。</p>
<p>上面我們已經指出上海在目前所處的地位，而一部分市民中尚有抱具要不得的心理，這是很為遺憾的。我們為喚起一般市民充分注意防空規則，竭力遵守防空規則起見，再將基本條件兩點申述如次：</p>
<p>防空警報之聲符，為防空最初步的常識，每個市民不論老幼婦孺均須清晰瞭解的，一聞笛聲，即可辨別是何種警報，知所行動。本市防空訓練實施有日，但一般市民對於警報聲符辨別之常識，尚未確知，警戒警報每與解除警報纏誤。本報自昨天起刊載之「防空警報常識」示意表格一種，將連載一周，表內說明警戒，空襲，戒除三種警報之汽笛不同符號，希望市民共同注意，記憶清楚，家長諭知子女，店主告知夥友，機關團證製成鉅幅圖表，張貼顯着地方，使屬昌職工咸知清楚。</p>
<p>嚴防燈光外洩，為夜間防空最基本的條件，每一住戶，不論工商住家均須絕對遵守的。燈光稍有洩漏，即為敵機最易抓住之目標，而為施以襲擊之方向。所以，空襲時燈光外洩，不但害已，抑且害人。從另一方面說，不使燈光外洩，並非難事，也並無大的不便，能否做到，僅在注意與否而已。在管制期間，如果燈光外洩，則受剪電被罰等處分，何苦為了小的不注意，而甘受精神與物質上的處罰呢！希望家長店主以及機關團體的負責人士隨時告誡家人屬員，共同注意，不使燈光外洩。</p>
<p>我們知道，敵美飛機兩次空襲日本北九州，均無大損害，實山於平等當局防空訓練周密，人民嚴格遵守防空規則所致。所以，我們更應急起訓練，才可應付當前及未來的環境。</p>
<h3>塞班島展開　壯烈大血戰　敵矇蔽宣傳不攻自破</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於塞班島之戰況，敵軍曾由無綫電廣播謂：自本月九日以來，以欺騙之手段，矇蔽世界有識之士，然日軍雖存一兵一卒，定必奮戰到底，而對敵軍之進攻，亦予以最大之打擊。以完成塞班島戰略上之使命，現該島正急速製開驚天地泣鬼神之壯絕之不血戰。敵方稱此次塞班島之戰鬥，為太平洋中規模最大，進攻最驚人之大海戰，十三日復由無綫電廣播路透社之戰訊，謂塞班島尚在繼續激戰中，是以於九日敵方所向世界廣播之佔領該島之豪語，已全予忘却，誠為不攻自破之欺瞞世人之手段。根據敵軍自開戰來所發表損害之總數字，合計為一五〇五三名（其中戰死二三六七名，戰傷一一四八一名，行踪不明者一二〇五名），與確數實相差懸殊，其又一欺瞞之手段，即此可以想像。敵美軍此次特進攻周圍不足三十哩之一塞班小島，尚且付以重大的代價，並遭受驚人損失，充分表明美軍對作戰無任何經騐及謀略。蔽方曾說出「此次塞班島之一舉成功，實為大東亞戰爭已完全敗北」之豪語，而其損失之實情，竟閉而不宣，以翼逃避世人之耳目，然日軍之巧妙奮戰，絕對不致因其狂語而發生動搖，確信今後日軍之作戰，將護實在塞班島之敵美軍必再遭「瓜違康納爾」一戰之覆轍。</p>
<h3>動員科學技術者日閣議通過要綱　增强飛機及關連兵器戰力</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日政府為謀增强以飛機及與此有關連各兵器為中心之戰力，乃對科學技術要員之積極動員，斷然加以再配置，次更以國民動員計劃之一部，擬定「科學技術動員要綱」，於十一日提出之閣議中討論，經岸國務相說明理由後，即將之議決通過，日情報局於十三日下午二地發表其要旨如次：　擬定科學技術要員之年度需給計劃事宜，　以需要言，注意以下諸事項，生產，交通，通信，建設，科學醫療及衛生各技術人員。　以供給言，注意以下諸事項，理科學校畢業者，科學技術者之短期養成，科學技術者「動員再配置之對像」，專門學校以上之理科學生「在關學生動員者」。　當擬定需給計劃時，注意下列各點，置重點於飛機工業及與有關之各產業，並確保電波兵器及其他重要產業部門之科學技術者，可為適應本計劃之策定，特請求左列之措置，（甲）於重要工廠或研究所，就短期間養成中堅科學技術者，（乙）旣有科學技術者之重點再配置，優秀科學技術者之重點活用，（丙）謀理科學校畢業生之增加，同時，對之作計劃的配置，該計劃即時實施之。</p>
<h3>日空軍活躍　獲偉大戰果　襲芷江桂林機塲</h3>
<p>日軍某基地十三日中央社電　渝美空軍最近於湖南上空甚為活躍，彼等雖持物質之龐大，實行反攻，然僅八日間，即為日軍擊落一百零六架，為渝美空軍自衡陽機場丟失後，即退守零陵，然未幾零陵又告陷落，嗣即據守桂林，企圖蠢動。但九日桂林亦遭轟炸，且喪失飛機二十八架。又八日夜遂川及梁山兩機場，亦蒙重創，故目前日機，已於夜間展開波狀轟炸，同時畫間亦不斷光顧渝美空軍基地，故日空軍連日之活躍，已獲偉大成果云。</p>
<p>日軍前綫基地十三日中央社電　日機曾於十二日深夜，急襲渝美空軍第一綫根據地湖南省西部之芷江機塲，（衡陽西方三百公里，）當炸毀渝大型機二架，小型機二十四架，此外尚有小型機二十五架，亦被炸毀，日機則已安反基地。按渝美空軍自衡陽機塲失陷後，即以芷江·桂林·丹竹·等為第一綫根據地，然日機之轟炸行動，迄未稍懈。九日於襲擊桂林後，綱於十二日黎明轟炸芷江機塲，使負重創。</p>
<p>日大本營發表戰況</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日本大本營七月十三日下午二時半發表，中國方面日空軍機隊，七月十二日拂曉製芷江美駐渝空軍飛機塲，使地上停留中之大型機兩架，小型機四十九架被擊毀或燃燒，日機無事歸還原防。</p>
<p>在華日軍某基地十三日中央社電　日空軍機隊於十一日，當陸上部隊渡涉連江時，以急降轟炸機隊，轟擊該江對岸渝軍之永久陣地。又向英德前方之渝軍第二綫陣地，實施索敵攻擊，同時企圖阻止渝軍進攻。執拗來擊之美空軍，復於十二日上午九時半，以（豻）型轟炸機六架來襲清遠附近，日軍機戰　機人當即起飛，向轟炸該地之美機攻擊，確實擊落其一架，擊毀其二架，日軍無損害。</p>
<p>日機轟炸桂林機塲</p>
<p>中國方面日軍某基地十三日中央社電　日空軍於十日晨，曾急襲在渝美空軍最重要前進基地桂林，與以重大損害。自日軍到達衡陽後，遂川·贛州·零陵·及其他粵漢綫附近之各基地，即感受重大威脅。因之渝美最近於桂林集結相當空軍兵力，企圖繼續反攻，以昆明為在渝美空軍之首部，以桂林為其心臟部，故美渝決不能失此重要據點。因之數年以來渝美軍於該地日夜建設，今桂林可謂一大空軍要塞，自該地形勢觀，該處更具有空軍要塞之要素。桂林東環山，丘陵亙連，正可於該處建設廣大機塲，並更宣利用山麓，建造高射砲及高射機關砲陣地，防備日機轟炸。且該地機塲三所，各連絡公路，設備完善，其主要之滑走路，即超重之B29型轟炸機亦能任意起飛，其設施之完全，已可想見。據曾數度攻擊桂林之日軍某隊長談，此次轟炸桂林，見該地均已變貌，此實令人驚奇，今敵人正舉全力從事建設，故桂林改為不可不注意之基地云。一方其防空砲火亦極猛烈，當飛機轟炸該處，無論何時，均似包於火綱之中，但日空軍現對此重要之空軍要塞，正日夜攻擊。十日晨之夜間轟炸，復又擊毀其二十八架，且今後仍將繼續猛烈攻擊。</p>
<h3>怒江方面渝軍　已陷於困境</h3>
<p>怒江前綫日軍基地十三日中央社電　前綫渝軍雖曾渡越怒江，數度反攻，但均遭日軍擊退。渝軍自五日以來，在大砲及戰轟炸機聯合編隊掩護下，企圖奪凹拉孟，集中全軍火力，向日軍陣地猛攻，但經日所在部隊痛擊後，均紛紛潰退，自一日以後五日間，渝軍遺屍達百五十七具，日軍並鹵獲兵器洋藥甚多。騰越方面渝軍亦自五日以來，取包圍態勢，意圖進展日軍據點，但經日軍邀擊，予以重大損害後，業已崩潰。一忟，接近零陵東方之渝軍約三百，亦遭敗北，目今怒江西岸之渝軍，實已陷於進退維谷之境。</p>
<h3>梅津司令官　歡宴陳大使</h3>
<p>新京十三日中央社電　關東軍司令官兼日本駐滿全權大使梅津氏，十二日下午六時在官邸歡宴我國駐滿特命全權大使陳濟成及大使館楊參事，蕭武官補佐官及各秘書官陳隨員等，由梅津司令官親自招待，並有關東軍最高顧問楠木中將·吉岡中將·日本大使館花輪參事官餘人，對中日邦交之敦睦，誠意合作種種懇談，席間觥籌交錯，談笑風生，情緒甚為融洽，直至九時餘始盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>日軍奇襲　佔領松柏亭　湘南已至決戰階段</h3>
<p>湖南前綫十三日中央社電　日軍左翼進擊部隊，前於四日不流血佔領衡陽南方四十公里之來陽後，更沿粵漢綫繼續南進，隨處擊毀混亂之敵第六十二軍。十一日拂曉，遂將衡陽南方六十公里之松柏亭佔領，刻正繼續猛烈進擊中。日軍此次佔領松柏亭，均以奇襲戰法，而不流血奪取者。該地亞鉛工廠及鉛製廠，及鉛製品三百噸鎔鑛廠二座，完全歸諸日軍手中，同時該工廠工人，並無一人逃避，立即開始協力日軍之工作。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十三日中央社電　一部日軍為與包圍衡陽繼續進攻之左翼部隊相呼應，乃沿粵漢路西方地帶，繼續猛進，七日佔領金蘭寺，衡陽東北地區渝第四軍第七十三軍，及第四十八第十五兩師，已陷混亂狀態。日軍突於十日對之加以攻擊，目下正展開大挪蕩戰。由於日軍左翼部隊之急進，及左翼部隊之巧妙殲滅戰，湖南省南端之戰已至決定局面。渝軍首腦間對第六戰區之慘敗，至憂慮。蔣介石之曾於三日對第六戰區司令長官，發出悲苑之命令謂，「今後作戰，關係中國存亡」，務望上下團結一致，以圖獲得最後勝利。無軍令而擅自撤退者，一律按連坐嚴懲不貸。」</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十二日夜發表湖南及廣東戰况如次：（一）湖南戰綫衡陽外部作戰展開後，迄今旬日，刻仍繼續進行。十一拂曉，日軍再度開始砲擊，陸上部隊雖反復猛烈强製，然渝軍守備部隊於空軍掩護下，極力防戰，刻正展開激戰中。（一）廣東戰綫，日軍清遠（廣州北方七十公里）東北方更向方進攻，刻已抵達閱漢綫上之英德南方二十公里連江北岸，與邀擊之渝軍交戰云。</p>
<p>美報論述中國戰局</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　芝加哥新聞重慶訪員，頃論述中國戰綫戰局如次：「日軍於控制中國東南部交通綫攻擊衡陽後，似有迅速向桂林方面進攻意圖。現日軍仍在繼續猛攻衡陽，渝軍守備隊雖經痛烈阻擊，但得渝殘軍掩護，正在死守中。此外渝美空軍更進攻漸現伸長之日軍補給綫，及其後方基地，予最前綫以轟炸及射擊，企圖妨害日軍之行動。然日軍於湖南省南部之作戰，欲將中國東南部渝美空軍之大半完全佔領，因之於中國沿岸自空中攻擊日軍船舶運輸范圍，已被壓縮。又廣西省之渝美空軍，果能攻擊通行於南中國海轟炸國內之日軍運輸船舶，然廣西省是否終能確保，仍成問題。如此，則日軍之眞正意圖，果在何方，將視日軍今後尚擁有如何龐大之兵力。但凡此種種，均為所不知者。再者，此問題尚擊於日軍對守衛已獲得之鐵道，是否有動員其預備兵力之意向，按日軍進攻之第一義，在破壞擊滅渝美空軍，由中國東南各基地出動作戰之效力，其第二義在於獲得進達南洋日軍各佔領地之鐵道，及陸路補給綫」云。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　重慶合眾社特派員，就十二日夜渝軍當局發表之戰况，曾披瀝所懷如次，日軍已攻至距清遠四十公里之地點，已將粵漢綫之要衝英德國人可以直接攻擊之勢力圈內，渝當局對英德之戰鬥，日軍如能佔領英德，即可　湖南方面之日軍南北相呼應，可將廣大之戰綫壓縮至二百五十公里以下。渝軍於湖南戰綫，曾企圖實施對日軍側面反擊，施後方作戰之方策，使日軍之作戰計劃受牽制，但至今日未發生何等變化。渝軍當局對廣東戰綫日軍左翼之顯着進展，已感湖南危機已去之見解，有再修正之必要。又上週渝方宣傳之日軍總退却之訊。今已確認其係虛偽宣傳。</p>
<h3>駐蒙日軍　六月中戰果</h3>
<p>張家口十三日中央社電　六月份駐蒙日軍及警察隊協力下，所獲戰果如次：交戰次數四九，共軍兵力六〇〇四，覆滅設施一一三，俘虜七一，棄屍三三六，主要鹵獲品步槍一二〇，各種彈藥三〇五五。</p>
<h3>經委會修正　組織條例</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　全國經濟委員會之設立主旨，乃在審核國家經濟政策，調整經濟使命。近該會為切實担負此重大使命，特將該會組織條例，予以修正，並經中政會通過公佈。其組織條例中規定有就該會所管事務，分設各局辦理。記者頃往該會探詢，據云會方原擬設調查局與統計局，惟會方前曾設立經濟調查研究所，辦理調查工作，茲擬强化該所調查工作，業已招考調查員三名，故不擬再設調查局。至於統計局原擬七月一日成立，茲因籌備不及，故予延期。關於該局之組織條例，現正草擬中，擬呈中政會通過府主計處下之統計處，辦理國府各院部之一切主計工作。</p>
<h3>東南學院　校董會成立</h3>

<h3>粉麥會增加特種麺粉配給　戶口粉配給盡力設法中</h3>
<p>處此民食嚴重時期，關於麺粉戶口配給及各業特種配給，頗為社會各界所關心。中央社記者爰特走訪粉麥統制委員會主任委員孫仲立，承發表談話云：本會自辦理粉麩統配以來，業經一載，對於各利配級，按期照配，從未間斷，雖在此靑黃不接及米糧甚感缺乏之際，亦將戶口粉配給盡力設法，並每期加配苞米粉半斤，聊補民食之不足。邇以各麵製品業需耍增多，少數業者遂不惜放價收買，以致釀成麵粉黑市。本會以辦理粉麥統制之立塲，自應通盤籌劃衡情酌理，將此項配給麵粉增加數量，而尤注重於平民化之麵製食品。如大餅油條切麵等業之配給，務期適合實際需要數量，好在今歲麥收豐稳，產地小麥均已登塲，本會收買工作早經開始，各粉廠即可全部開車，此後粉麩生產量可望漸見增加，當無匱乏之處。</p>

<h3>跌進票面股票　將勒令淸算　澈查公司賬目杜絕投機</h3>
<p>滬市自有華商股市以來，原爲倡導投資事業之復興，促進工高企業之發展，不意一般經營者，竟以投炎而爲投機之思想，尤其是藉名招搖，肅設公司，而以發行股票爲撈獲資金之目的，自今年以來，股市一蹶不振，股票慘跌，愈演愈厲，其一般業外人受股市之慘跌，損失甚鉅，甚至有數十種股票，跌進價值票面以內者。此種情形，雖係銀根據緊所致，但最大癥結，仍係被投機者造成，而公司內容組織不健全，無實際營業，引起持股者不信任。最近有張善現等所創設之華成實業股份有限公司，有鑒於本公司股票雖未上市交易，而黑市市價亦被跌至四元五元之間，其影響公司信譽重大，故該公司爲維護股東權益計，決定於七月三十一日召開股東臨時會議，討論自動淸算，並將公司資產分別壞賣後，照發行股票票面十足收回，以昭信用。中央社記者爰特走訪該公司經理楊長康，據稱本公司自創立後，已有六個月，資本五千萬元，共業務範圍除經營房地產外，並設有機器廠及投資中華電工廠，半年來雖未多獲盈餘，但以資產所值，並無虧折。按公司營業本訂繼續維持，惟近來因本公司股票黑市股值慘跌不已，此與公司信譽有關，故爲維持創辦人信譽，及股東利益計，決定變買本公司資產，照票面十足發還股欵，自動淸算云云。又據記者向關係方面探悉，政府主管當局，鑒於股市之跌落，與公司方面當有特殊關係，經調查结果，認爲有多數上市股票之公司，尤其是跌進票面之公司，其內部組織不健全，或資產空虛，或業務上確無生產可取者，如任其股票上市流動，則影嚮社會經濟，與股東之利益實爲重大，故對於上項上市股票之公司，將嚴萬查賬，一經查出定富勒令淸算收回股票，照票面十足發還股欵，以免發生流弊而絕投機。</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討</h3>
<p>全國的協力之必要</p>
<p>上海市政府及米統會公布的米糧臨時辦法，原擬使米糧儘量從內地運入上海，並特別宜稱，在公佈搬入口準備完了之前，許可其無限制搬入。但如上所述，內地的縣政府，則取這種態度，即：「那是不行的，上海如果取這種政策，內地祗有取徹底限制從內地搬出的態度」。那是決不能等閑視之的嚴重問題。上海與內地農村叛離的傾向，本極可慮，而在靑黃不接期上海市政府與內地縣政府施策的對立，尤不能不從速消除。無限制搬入不是無計劃搬入，因各縣政府的自衛揹置，而希望由單幫來搬入比現在量更多的米糧，是很困難的。所以總得希望用正式護照大量搬八能够順利地成功。</p>
<p>米商大槪總想收買便利的地域，及市價低廉的地域，搬入米糧到上海。於是並不檢討那是否可能，祇向米統會早謂發給最大限度數量的護照。</p>
<p>其結果，助長了米商問的無統制的競爭，並威脅內地各地區自用的民食量。發給護照者，不能相信其必能將其數量全額搬入上海，米統會方面以爲，有計劃的參酌各縣政府的民食必需量與上海的民食必需量，而决定從各縣收買數量的限度，頗感困難。結果，發給護照時，織加限制，那也祗是申謂發護照的米商有無優秀性等枝節問題，對於各縣的需要與上海的需要，或許不加以綜合的計劃的檢討，萬一真是這樣，那不是米糧統制，而是米糧無統制。</p>
<p>現在是靑黃不接期，在此時期加以計劃的統制，是絕對必需的。米統會工作，已經從單獨工作推移爲與市政府的共同工作。事態已發展至米統會與市政府，省縣政府之間關於米糧搬出入必須協定緊急對策，在意見完全一致的基礎上，推進工作。解決數量與價格問題的唯一方法，不是自由移動，而是靑黃不接時期之有計劃的行動。</p>
<p>如記者所已述，各消費都市正在食米統制。此在各消費都市，至少應將縣政府之行政責任上的靑黃不接期之配給，作爲米糧施策之一部而加以計劃。然而此議未見實施，聽說是因爲「米糧對策應絕對在米統會一元化」的抽象理論，與「各縣政府允許配給食米時，將妨害米統會確保收買目的量」的具體的憂慮。目覩靑黃不接期各地實情的記者，見內地遭遇空前的米糧時，米梳會辦事處無所事事，專以自身作為行政機關而設法打開這難關。我們知道，創始時的「米糧統制，應由米統會處理」的抽象理念，不復維持，米糧施策機關的首腦者，與內地省縣政府之間，關於米糧移動的具體問題，應協議妥善的處置，米糧施策機關　上的自由移動的條文，與聲明，縱高明入雲，假使米糧不移動，上海市民不是可以食條文而能生存下去嗎？米糧施策當局者聽着：現在正是應加以最大的努力，調整上海與內地間的米糧。（譯自六月二十三日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>防空待避所　建造要領</h3>
<p>應建在何處</p>
<p>先研究應建在何處最好的問題。建在室外呢還是在室內。一般以爲建在室內，無雨水流入之虞，即在夜間或嚴寒時，使用起來亦更便利。且建在室內，可以比室外更淸楚知道落在本室的燒夷彈，而容易出動，從事應急防火工作。</p>
<p>那末，建在望內時，地板上好呢？遲是地板下好。地板下因爲位置較低，自然比地板上安全。且泥土是很好的掩護物，在地板下掘穴攤開　席或床板，立刻就可以當待避所使用，這是最便利的方法之一。</p>
<p>上面所說的是一般地安全。當然，也有因各家室的情形而建在地板上較好的塲合，也有建在室外較好的塲合。這些都應該視各地的情形而言。</p>
<p>室內待避所</p>
<p>室內地下待避所怎樣建造才好呢？茲舉最簡易的例于；在地板下掘一僅够匿體的穴，就成很好的待避所。穴的深淺，祗須足够伏身即可。又萬一附近落下炸彈，因其衝動而有各種東西落下來的時候，地板成爲天然的掩蓋物，遮在上面，的確很便利</p>
<p>這時候，不能爲了掘穴，而使建築物有損，所以應敵建築物的基礎約三公分掘穴。</p>
<p>本來待避不必很長時問，所以建造待避所時，因物炎的不足，應避免使用很多的炎材與勞力。土質堅硬的地方，傾斜一點也不要緊。形式也不必一定。愈簡易您好，所以視各家的情形而定。</p>
<p>但如果手頭有資材的話，則利用之，如用板欄土，或用蓆數地，當然更好。往地板下掘的時候，如果地下有水，或因地下有煤氣管或自來水管，而不能掘至足够伏身的深淺時，可在穴的周　雍土，以補足其深度。</p>

<h3>飛機增產的意義</h3>
<p>— 陸軍大佐飯島正義</p>
<p>「盡量送飛機到戰綫去，即使多一架也是好的」。因爲國民爲了當應這口號而奪起，犧牲其生活，舉其總力以增產飛機，故全體國民至誠獻納的新銳機，累積已達四千數百餘架。</p>
<p>國民對於增產飛機的協力，如果單是當事者的口頭禪，自然不能充分完成增產的目的。除了對飛機本質有了正確的認識之外，還須自覺增產的意義，而自動的協力增產時，增產道名詞方是實至而非口惠。</p>
<p>飛機大最消耗</p>
<p>現在的飛機，各國都是一樣，不像在過去戰爭中的陸地大砲或步槍，能够經年累月的使用下去。普通都因大量的戰鬥消耗與自然消耗，而在極短的時日中消耗盡了。戰鬥消耗每月多少，因戰況而異，且正確的數字，將有待於戰後各國所發表的統計，然而英美空軍的空炸歐陸，及德空軍對每千架擊落的比例，常在五至七％之間，有時達一五％；假使報章與無綫電的報道是真實的話，那麼彼我以相等的戰力作激烈空戰的戰錢上，擊落與擊毀的損害合計起來，一個月間的戰鬥消耗，決不在少，那是可想而知的。</p>
<p>另一方面，自然消耗除了壽命告終不能使用者以外，亦有因起飛降落時發生事故者，及不得已降落者，因而不僅是第一綫部隊，即在國內的敎育訓練部隊，亦多因機塲的良窳，飛行要求的難易，使用的次數，駕駛者的技術，整備能力等關係，其比率亦不一定，不能一槪而論，但不能漢視者亦爲數頗多。大槪影響於國內敎育訓練部隊者小；而影響於使用不良機塲，及因被敵彈而不能操縱如意的戰綫部隊者大。各航空部隊的飛機在這種情形下消耗着的。所以假定連日經激烈空戰而完全不補充，則出動機數每次漸减，不久即成爲零。爲雜持出戰時的戰力，不能不以陸地兵器所不能比較的比率迅速補充。</p>
<p>每日消耗着的飛機中，不因突發的事故而壽命告終者，自然也很多。飛機，特別是發動機的壽命，非常短促，造成之後，不能二年三年的使用下去，就使軍艦和商船，使用了某時期，也須入塢大修，何況精巧的飛檢？</p>
<p>發動機的壽命</p>
<p>而發動機的壽命，即能使用多少時候的問題，要有關於器材的精粗，信賴性的大小，因機種，型式而異。大槪每一發動機經五六百小時的壽命而不堪使用以後，除以之作爲廢物外，普通均送至修理工塲利用之可再使用的部分品，加以重製。</p>
<p>飛機不僅其壽命如此之短，而即在其短促的生存時間中，也常發生疾病而夭折。所以爲了先事診斷以除去病原起見，在使用期問，每隔某一時期必須檢查容易發生障害的部分，換除衰弱的部分品以保持健康。這定期檢查的次數愈多，每次所需的時間愈久，則部隊保有機數中可能出動的機數亦愈減少。所以爲了防止因定期檢查而减低出動率，理想上，自然最好增大器村的信賴性，使這種定期檢查無此必要。而要增大信賴性，自素材以至於完成品的製造過程中，對一點也沒有毛病或錯誤的微細部分，也必須集注精神確實工作，嚴密檢查其良否。而信賴性較大的部份品所綜合組成的飛機，其壽命必然也較長。軍需省航空兵器局長官遠藤中將常力主製造「混合蔚靈魂的飛機」，其原因半在於此。</p>
<p>又增大各部處理的簡易性，在縮短定期檢查的工作時間上，不僅盡着很大的任務，且是縮短整備時間的必須條件。這種信賴心的向上，拚裝法的改善，處理簡單性的增大，即是增加出動率，沿着增產之綫而進，但無論定期檢查也好，每日的整備也好，先決問題是先有充足的補用品與工具。無此，簡單的修理調整也不能實施，則飛機在補充之前，自將不能使用</p>
<p>呼號增產飛機，舉全部生產能力競爭製造完美的飛機，此爲人情所同然，不問敵我。生產補用品與生產完美機同時並進，也就是增加出動機數，依着增產的目的而進。</p>
<p>如上所述，要維持前綫部隊的戰力，必須大量補充。而這補充常以前綫部隊爲急需，漸次推及後方。假使反之，以國內制作爲爲扇眼，而以前綫爲扇面，而配備補給機，則在某一時期或能發揮偉大的戰力，結果終成曇花一現。所以前綫的機數增加一架時，後方必須增加幾倍的補給機。</p>
<p>增加部隊補充飛機</p>
<p>增產機就是這樣使用於爲了維持第一綫與後方訓練部隊的戰力，行有餘力，始可創設或擴充新部隊。這些過剩機，編成的新部隊，派遣至需要戰綫。</p>
<p>可是新創增加部隊不像口頭說說那樣簡單，而有待於相當時日。即新設部隊，必須必要部隊長及空軍人員之訓練，且爲展開這部隊，必須設定需耍戰塲，並所需燃料彈藥，然後始能派遣新設部隊至前綫</p>
<p>而新設部隊的增加，不用說，補給機數自須隨之俱增，但其增產的出數則不能不保持平均。因補給的不圓滑，而在前綫部隊的戰力上，產生消長波動，則在戰力低下時，有爲敵所乘之慮。</p>
<p>另一方面，因爲增產是希望增加前綫的出動機數，故徒然增加出數，而造成不能飛的飛機，自不能完成其月的。信賴性與處理簡易性的向上，及補充適量的補用品，與增加出動機數有極大關係。認識並考慮這一點，而謀生產機數之增加，方才是眞正的增產。且在工塲生產機數，各國均因國內的炎源狀態而不能無限擴大的今日，愈覺有再三研究增產觀念的必要。（作者爲日本陸軍航空本部航務課長）（翔：譯目六月十八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>馬紹爾島洋面　日潛艇血戰記</h3>
<p>四月十六日白書，在馬紹爾群島附近，威武堂　擊敵方大型航空母艦，且一擊即破，而建立奇功的潛水艇長某少校，會寫下如左的血記：</p>
<p>某月某日　“賢妻愛子呵！我們是皇國的後盾，以生命來換取功勞吧！”上午十一時，主要機器發動了，我來到艦橋上，看到雄壯的主要機器，在吞吐著空氣，喇叭嘹亮的“出港準備”聲音，業已　澈天空。潛艇靜悄悄地離開了海岸。呵，真是一個風和日暖的豔陽天氣！</p>
<p>是三度征討過程的海，波浪雖高，但潛空是可以不怕的。</p>
<p>某月某日　今天雖然也是陰天，但波浪很小，所以不必潛航也可以，　是謝天謝地值得慶祝的事。在這樣值得慶祝的　圍中，我就默默地想“潛水艇戰狩獵論。”</p>
<p>出發狩獵</p>
<p>潛水艇出去破壞交通，正像出發狩獵一樣。狩獵也有大規模的狩獵，所以必須有充分的武裝，精密的準備計畫。實施這種計畫時，就要爬山越嶺同，過江渡河，入人煙未至之處，紥營設寨，與蟲狼虎豹等野獸相鬥，如獅虎等大　饕來，則立刻加以撲殺，撲殺後，立刻再準備應付其他猛獸的　擊。這種情形下，我們人類並非就是勝利者，有時也往往犧牲一部傷人。固然非忍受困苦饑渴不可，但撲獲勝利品時的瞬間，是非常快活的，這就是不顧一切勞苦而行狩獵的道理。潛水艇戰是爲戰鬥而戰的，往往潛行至敵方飛機，哨戒艇等附近，一擊命中，假如目標愈大，則愈痛快。爲達到此目的，則必須與炎暑酷寒，以及艇內窒息的空氣奮鬥，更須忍受各種的不方便，以及連日不斷的苦痛。狩獵家既有因捕獸而要命者，那末潛水艇當然也有時不幸爲敵所殺。假如老是注意這類事，就什麽也不能作了。我們潛水艇隊員的對方，正像猛獸一樣。</p>
<p>準備魚雷</p>
<p>某月某日</p>
<p>在到達作戰海面前，我命令準備魚雷，會費了三天二天，完全準備就緒，我凝視著　成白銀色的魚雷光線，而在思索：鄭重製造出來的魚雷，而必須鄭重發射，以取得無上戰果。</p>
<p>作戰海面逐漸迫近，白畫需要潛航，於是吃飯的時間便不能正常了。出發時，早飯在上午七時，午餐在上午十一時四十五分，晚餐則在下午五時十五分，八時一過，還要吃一頓夜飯。然而現在則早飯在上午三時，午飯在下午五時，晚飯在下午九時　。以前那樣的夜飯，已經改爲上午十一時吃了。此外睡眠時間，差不多完全改變了。早晨潛航時睡覺。只是吃飯和大小便時起來。在不能入睡時，就讀小說之類的東西。夜間因爲不知什麽以時候就會安然發現敵人的，所以當然不准睡的。於是當晨光曦微時就支持不下去了，所以睡覺。夜間就是我活躍的舞台。現在我必須稍　去瞭望一下。</p>
<p>某月某日　本艇到達作戰海面後，業已過了數日，覺著與敵相　也妨了，但連日東風甚劇，波浪高度約二公尺，當本艇橫行時，則搖擺甚劇。如果這樣碰到敵人，襲擊將有少許困難，大家都這樣擔心著。新鮮食糧業已用完，每天只是吃罐頭了。</p>
<p>某月某日　結果今天也沒遇見敵人。我真沒有福氣，甚至有不高興者。固然不是暴燥和名譽心的驅使，而是想殺敵人所致。</p>
<p>發射管室充滿著螢光燈的藍白色，許多魚雷尚未得到勝利品，我心中想，這些魚雷如不命中敵人，決不回基地。發射管室，全都配置得非常整齊。</p>
<p>發現敵艦</p>
<p>四月十六日</p>
<p>在未明時分，瞭望員發見了類似敵方飛機的東西。立刻開始潛航。於是毫無危險地過去，一過午，收音機員說：“右○○度活塞音感○”。於是我下令“就位”！跑到司令塔上用潛望鏡看。在我的眼睛裏映現出隱約的東西來。在方位角左九十度有驅逐艦護衛著，而小心翼翼地劃著白色波浪，在左一百二十度上航行著航空母艦。距離爲○公里。</p>
<p>在風濤大作的海上，潛望鏡動　即不發生效力。如想等候平靜，則本艇因大浪而浮出，把著潛望鏡的我，反吃了一大驚。當時自然無暇衡量敵艦的距離和速度，而汗珠竟流入眼內。</p>
<p>用潛望鏡看到的敵方航空母艦，突然在面前轉變方向，而向回走，呵，我心中知道這是收飛機回基地去的。從潛望鏡的視野左面，向右面橫飛的飛機，在準備降落到母艦上了。突然航空母艦縮減了速度，而在細心注視著的我，決意下令進行魚雷戰，和大型航空母艦的距離，業已夠得上魚雷戰了。於是我就用傳聲筒下令進行魚雷戰。我在想“真是上天保佑，讓我們能進行得手的襲擊”。</p>
<p>前此與本艇採取相當角度的驅逐艦，突然改變了方向。方位角爲零度，正是對著本艇來的。</p>
<p>距離○公里，我正像冷水澆頭一樣，感覺到敵艦或許業已發現了我們的潛艇，甚至想逃避，於是把潛望鏡撤到水裏。但連想到前此的忍痛耐苦，因逃避而成爲毫無意義的事情。於是就想到既然發現，就要用炸雷攻擊的，否則就沒有　法的。我的決心一定，又發出命令，露出潛望鏡來。但驅逐艦的方位角，仍然是零度。我心中想，敵人究竟來了，如放過這個機會，則襲擊的機會就不會再來了。</p>
<p>命中敵艦</p>
<p>眨眼間，描准了航空母艦。敵方航空母艦呀，好好吃我們一粒衛生丸吧！然後深入海底，葬於魚腹。於是我就決心下令發射魚雷了。發射後，就退到○○公尺外的深海去。我們會聽到兩聲魚雷的命中聲音。我看見全體艇員都歡天喜地的面孔，而身爲艇長的我，是更加高興的。</p>
<p>後來敵艦的運動突然變了。有時停駛，有時高速度航駛，有時向遙遠的海面上施以爆雷攻擊，還有時在本艇的上面施以刺耳的聲音掠過，總之，繼續不斷地進行各種奇形怪狀的行動。於是在四小時以內，靜坐而細聽著敵艦的行蹤。後來聽到一艘軍艦走了，其他一艘軍艦也逐漸向北方去了。我看見夜幕籠罩了海面的時候，並不以爲完全逃出敵艦的追擊。迅速充實電力，以及放入艦內空氣，同時嚴令監視敵艦，而又開始潛航了。（譯自六月八日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>西歐戰場形勢</h3>
<p>六月五日夜，反軸心軍以轟炸機約一千架集中轟炸法國北部大西洋要塞地帶，至夜半更形激烈，轟炸範圍亦由海岸要塞擴大至後方德軍預備部隊的集合地點。六日清晨一時許，反軸心軍的空　部隊更於基賽及耶賽兩島，塞納與奧爾納兩河口中間地區及柯坦汀半島東岸與尖端開始著陸，德軍當即起而　擊掃蕩。嗣後，反軸心軍的水陸剛用部隊複於哈伐港至瑟堡一帶的海岸地區登陸，於奧爾納河下流地區築成橋頭堡，但最初降下的英國空輸部隊則幾乎全部戰滅。七日，在艦砲猛烈的掩護射擊下，反軸心軍於巴猶地方及其西文地區設立了第二個橋頭堡。其後，雙方各調援軍，以奧爾納及維爾兩河中間地區和柯坦汀島基部一帶爲中心，展開鬼哭神　的攻防戰。</p>
<p>據德國駐日大使史塔瑪談稱，在蒙高茂萊指揮下的侵歐兵力，包括地上部隊及降落傘部隊在內，共計約有二十七師左右。又據英相邱吉爾在侵歐行動開始以後宣稱，反軸心軍在英法海峽水域　結大小艦船四千艘以上，並有小艇數千。可是，自從一九四零年七月英軍狼狽退出鄧扣　以來，在法國北部海岸一帶，德國早已用最進步的技術和最新穎的設計，築成堅強的要塞，並且駐有身經百戰的精銳部隊。反軸心軍在登陸以後，立刻到處受到德軍的追擊，損失慘重。迄今雖已苦戰月餘，依然沒有多大成就。回顧一月來的法北戰局，反軸心軍的首腦者也會慨　“得不償失”嗎？</p>
<p>最近數日德軍在侵歐前線，反攻順利，各段作戰均能重創敵軍，並遏陰其前進，敵軍突破之地，常爲德軍迅速收複，德軍士兵戰術高明。昨日德軍鐵甲束手榴彈兵，在克恩　西，擊退來犯英步兵，以一對十，而卒獲勝利。克恩西北德孤軍一支英勇作戰後，克複埃浦隆村，但結果仍爲敵軍奪去。敵軍　次進攻，均爲德軍反攻所挫，如在維爾與陶特間，英軍每欲發動進攻勢，德軍即行時出戰，使不得逞，英軍在巴隆及其他各地作戰，皆遭挫敗，蒙高茂萊現有配備精良之軍隊三十二師，進行大攻勢，並有數千架飛機助戰，猛轟德軍陣地，但德軍仍能扼守陣地，未嘗動搖，敵軍昨雖盡最大努力，但可得進展甚微。</p>

<h3>侵攻戰的準備</h3>
<p>一九四○年英國於鄧扣克敗退後，即　捲土重來，實行登陸，但當時英國本土裝備完全的軍隊僅有一師，不足以當德軍一擊，彼時德軍倘侵入英國本土，英國必敗無疑。一九四一年六月，德蘇戰事爆發，德軍集中全力於東線，英國本土所受危機緩和，是年末，美國又參戰，“西歐侵入”夢想，乃開始感覺其現實性。</p>
<p>英軍當局爲草擬實施具體計劃，先命蒙特巴頓，陸軍大將巴齊埃特，空軍中將陶格拉斯，著手研究反軸心軍的一般戰略。但當前遭遇各種矛盾，尤其是物質的缺乏，致計畫未具體化。其後於一九四二年夏，羅斯福與邱吉爾在華盛頓舉行會談，對於“實行侵入”的意見，歸於一致。</p>
<p>一九四三年一月北非加薩勃朗加會議中，羅邱漠然決定於一九四四年中伺機發動，是年致力於地中海作戰，以　擊滅義大利主力。至是年八月澳洲奎貝克會議，大體決定侵入戰的日子，英美作戰當局在會議中詳細研究作戰計劃。</p>
<p>本年一月，更以美將艾森霍華代替英將掌握最高指揮權，又修正計劃，使更　具體化，但登陸日期的最後決定，還是極近的事情。（譯自六月十四日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>陳媽</h3>
<p>— 運晟</p>
<p>前幾日堂妹從故鄉出來，告訴我陳媽十分衰老，而且已做了祖母，同時她的兒子阿保比以前也長進得多了，提起了陳以，就使我一連串地聯想到她那可憐的身世</p>
<p>六年前，當戰爭的砲火波及我家的園宅時，只有陳媽倚在屋後竹園的籬笆上偷偷地滴了幾行淚。</p>
<p>陳媽有著瘦瘦的臉兒，尖下馬，稍似鷹爪的鼻子，矮小的身材。她是我家的老僕，從我的祖父起要不是爲了戰爭決不會離開我家的。在她幫傭的歷史中，沒有第二家東家，在我們家裏也沒有人厭惡過，甚至在祖父爲他五個兒子分家時叔父們暗地裏還爭論過關於對她的承繼權；每房似乎都有護爲己有的雄心，誰知她卻稟明了祖父，挑中了我們大房，（父親是祖父的長子）。</p>
<p>智慧和才能顯得她比別的傭人更令人親信。她能猜測主人的需要，及早安排，她能提醒主人忽略了的瑣事……家中之事，不論大的小的，粗的細的，一經她的手，莫不井井有條，各安其所，這於遠游的父親和孱弱多病的母親，是如何有力的幫助！</p>
<p>“你瞧！大房裏的陳媽，可抵別人家三四個傭人，生活快，人又老實，性子又耐氣……”叔母們常向我家投射著　羨和妒忌的目光。</p>
<p>一個凜冽的冬天的中午，我從校中（小學）回來，中飯時陳媽沒有侍侯，我很奇快。媽告訴我她的丈夫陳文甫凍死在東河邊的草棚內，陳媽收屍去了。</p>
<p>傍晚時分，陳媽拖著疲乏的身子回來，顯著平日不常見的沮喪的神情，眼皮有些紅腫，眼睛裏流露著遲疑的光芒，我很想問問她丈夫的死況，可是我不敢，因爲看了她的臉色，舉止，談吐都使我難於啓口。</p>
<p>第二年的清明，家家戶戶都忙著上墳掃墓。我第一次看見陳媽也備上了錫箔裝了屯？？不自覺的我也跟了她同去。我們在一塊黃金色的田邊停了步，隨後又向田畦中走去，終於被我發現了一個稻草包裹的棺材，橫躺在靠近小河的田頭。我想這一定是陳文甫，陳媽的丈夫，鬼的恐懼使我顫憟起來。此時陳媽放下了草屯，點著火，跪在地下，叩頭，接著便哀哀的哭泣，哭得很悽楚，又悱惻。</p>
<p>“鬼不是會出現的嗎？陳媽在故事裏多次告訴我，今天一定要被她哭出來了。”</p>
<p>“啊！鬼！我怕！”我哇的哭了起來。</p>
<p>陳媽止住了哭，抱著我回家，媽還爲我收喜，說是碰到了惡煞。</p>
<p>有一年的暑假裏，我們在屋前　場上納涼。我躺在藤榻上咬著蘆粟，和弟妹們逼著陳媽講故事！</p>
<p>“從前有個苦命的女人，在十八歲時由爺娘作主，配結張奢。誰知她的丈夫是個鴉片鬼，又是個賭鬼。她管束不住丈夫，只得自歎命薄。起初他們還有三四十畝自田，家境還算好，後來張奢越賭越輸，鴉片　也越弄越大，慢慢地把田押了，傢具也變賣了，衣服也偷去當了。此時家中已多了二張嘴，一個兒子和一個女兒……最後他在走頭無路的當兒，竟把祖宗傳下來的一宅三間瓦房也拆賣了。他便流落在外……抛下他苦命的妻子和伶仃的兒女……在沒奈何之中，女兒做了人家的童養媳，兒子替人家做長工，他的妻子也到人家幫傭去了。她很勤謹，一刻不停地做，因爲一有空，她就要想到丈夫和兒女，這樣她就會極其悲傷起來。”陳媽講到這裏，忽地止住了。擡起頭，我看見陳媽用雙手在擦眼淚。“她的心腸真好。”我想：“哀憐著故事中的人物而淌淚。”</p>
<p>一次陳媽患病，媽喚我去看望　，在她孤寂的病　畔，她呻吟著告訴我，她全身骨節都緊脹作痛，因爲以前受陳文甫的毒打而變成毛病的，每次病裏都要發作。</p>
<p>後來我認識了她的女兒阿美，是不堪她婆婆的虐待而逃到我家來的，過了三天，有一個陌生人，說是阿美的公公，找到我家來要領她回去，阿美大哭大呌地拉住廳上的柱子不肯走，他的公公向懷中摸出一根繩來對阿美一揚，威脅著道：</p>
<p>“快跟我走！別惹老爸的氣，免得吃苦……”</p>
<p>阿美好像天生的好漢，倔強地說：</p>
<p>“不，誰跟你去，我一輩子也不願到你家，見到你……還有婆婆……”</p>
<p>那陌生人憤怒地用繩索將阿美捆了，雖然阿美拼命抵抗，到底給他背走了。遠遠地傳來了阿美的哭聲，和　罵。這時陳媽哭起來了。</p>
<p>我真奇怪：大人們呆瞧著他們倆的演出，不幫阿美一點子忙！媽，週媽，還有別人傭人。</p>
<p>一年又一年，我眼看著陳媽漸漸地老，心事也愈來愈重，某年的寒假從校中（中學）返家，小妹妹拉著我的手，站在大門前的大樹下，邊指著河東黑白粉牆的建築，告訴我這是陳媽新建的房子。</p>
<p>夜裏，從媽的聞談中，知道陳媽已費去十幾年來所積蓄的薪工的大半，又在媽極大的幫忙下，築成了這所屋子，預備替她的兒子阿保娶媳婦，因爲他已經二十幾歲了，他們已屬意於宏叔家的婢女阿冬，正在央媒說合呢。</p>
<p>新年裏陳媽邀我去參觀了她的新宅，只是空屋三間而已，回家慫恿著媽送些破舊家具給她。使人遺憾的，卻是阿保有著乃父的遺風，雖不抽大煙，也是個老於賭道的君子，我默禱著願他不要承襲他爸爸的衣缽，來破壞他母親辛勞半世的熱望。</p>
<p>以後每一次回家，總聽到些阿保的賭訊，而且很容易看出陳媽對她兒子熱切的關心，滲入著敏銳的隱憂，在記憶裏的潦倒的陳文甫的影子，常常跟著阿保的名字，掠過我的腦際。</p>
<p>戰爭像狂風般捲過家鄉時，陳媽因捨不得離開她新建未及半載的房屋，不肯參加我們流浪的隊伍，孤單地留守在故鄉，在我家的房屋舉行火葬時，那寄居將近二十年的陳媽，充了唯一的執紼送喪者。</p>
<p>現在我想，大概老天已改變了作風，開始降福給陳媽了吧，但願如此。</p>
<h3>外國人眼中的　中國音樂　中國音樂的靈魂</h3>
<p>— H·斯維達洛夫</p>
<p>甚至會在中國住過的歐洲人也很少例外對中國音樂藝術能有正確的理解，多數人，是以中國民衆劇場由窗口飄送到街上轟隆隆的和音；和街頭無線電播音機中撕裂人心的尖嗓來樹立自己對於中國音樂的概念。由此而引起對中國音樂的輕視，特別多的是歐洲人。</p>
<p>可是，我們無需納罕於現代的中國人，也不大懂得欣賞自己的國樂。在中國知識份子中間。可以遇到要多少有多少知道和懂得查可夫斯基，　邦，甚至巴哈的人；可是關於中國固有音樂的遺産，卻未有一絲瞭解。因此，在現代中國能享有優勢的，還是十分初級的自生自滅的民衆音樂——擁有大量的民衆音樂家（自修者）——或是歐洲作曲家　音樂，其中也包括著爵士音樂。</p>
<p>就如劇場一樣，音樂在中國可說是在皇帝的宮廷中和統治階級底大規模上演中繁榮的。統治階級爲自己的娛悅才來支持這種藝術，留養音樂師在自己府邸中。樂師和戲子一般地度著悲慘的生活，而這是不能促使音樂高度發展的。但是單獨的天才倒底能逐漸昇至一般水凖以上，推動著國樂向前發展，創造著獨特的音樂思想底美妙方式，其中有許多和我們相關非常久遠的時代，唐朝——中國藝術底最盛期——已經有一千餘年，其時歐洲文化尚在繈褓中。可惜的是中國到現在還沒有自己的科學化地研究過的音樂史，而因此中國音樂對於其來日的發展，目前亦未有明鮮的道路，它或是彳　於原途，或是抛撇自己的國粹，　沒了它的真價值而反盲目地去模　歐洲的典型。</p>
<p>但是如今也應當提到中國音樂底現代史料，顯然地有些中國音樂團體代表者已開始自覺了。在最近些時，漸次有專門研究中國古典音樂的個人或團體出現，約六年之前在上海發起爲“中國國樂研究會”，它的領袖是中國最佳的簫手和琵琶名家孫裕德先生，該會是以研究往古的古典音樂，豐富它底管絃樂曲，使達到現代音樂藝術底水凖，使國樂在廣大的民衆中日　普遍化爲目的的。</p>
<p>數日前，在本埠蘭心戲院中國國樂會舉行第五次公開的中國古典音樂的演奏。演奏節目排列得非常成功，管絃樂曲，音樂獨奏，舞劍，和歌唱表演，統統都穿插有　地　進在內了！</p>
<p>這使得歐洲人反對中國音樂底偏見竟消失得非常快速，所有的耳朵，一開始就追逐著管絃樂底第一聲諧音，這一組是十個人，在絃樂中有中國農村底樂器——琵琶——在發音上使人聯想到我們的“吉他”，巨大的七絃琵琶佔著榮譽的地位一支簫（竹笛）四個胡琴（民間的兩絃琴“二胡”）這種樂器使人悠遠地聯想到我們的“巴拉拉意卡”（缺少它的高　聲）大鼓和其餘敲打的樂器。</p>
<p>在許多合奏中，最佳的是“攀輪袍”，正如一般所想，這是唐朝有名的詩人王維寫的，這是敘述一個英勇的項羽王一生的，他是生活在我們紀元前三世紀的英雄。音樂旋律活生生地傳出了項王底爭戰和顛沛，以至慘痛的敗北及他底死亡和與愛姬底哭別！</p>
<p>孫齊德先生在彈奏琵琶上顯出極優秀的藝術手腕，他彈的是宋朝的名曲——“淮陰平楚”，也是以描寫英雄爲題材。在音樂家的手中，琵琶便以無窮的變化音插入音響樂旋律中了。</p>
<p>非常滿意地聆完沈述紈小姐操縱著美而有力的嗓子的獨唱，在胡琴伴奏下她精神地唱了“秋思”，刻畫了遲暮婦人憂傷失去美貌和青春的心境。</p>
<p>看了葉大　先生和濮玉小姐合演的“舞劍”，是很有趣的，這個舞劍節目在演出上似乎已近於歐洲的舞蹈藝術。但是配合了自己　有的方式，眼神步法，均別有獨到之妙！</p>
<p>中國音樂有一種獨特的憂　性和冥想，或是戰爭的鬧聲。在這些特徵上，反映出了多少世紀的中國民族史，它努力掙扎於無窮的內戰和外患。這些特徵也在所有合奏的悲劇中呈現著的。</p>
<p>很難說這合奏樂是否反映了中國音樂真實的靈魂，可是有一點是可以堅信的：這個複雜的靈魂底某一部分，是被幽錮了的。（譯自第八十期俄文“時代”，作者爲該雜誌總編輯。）</p>
<h3>記中國古典音樂演奏會</h3>
<p>— L·阿爾諾特夫</p>
<p>六月廿八日和廿九日在蘭心大戲院舉行之“中國音樂研究會”主持的中國古典音樂演奏。</p>
<p>一般說來，國樂研究會的此次演奏，已引動了中國的音樂聽衆以深切趣味注視了在他們面前所顯示的，並發現了這在舊樂器上的古代的旋律底無價之瑰寶。</p>
<p>國樂研究會會長，兼樂隊指揮是孫裕德先生，孫君十五年來孜孜埋頭於古典音樂底複興工作，這種古樂，孔子會用以教他的門徒的。孫君擅長琵琶，且爲有名的簫手，同時應特別提出的爲該會總幹事韓振漢君，韓君在業餘之暇，會在工部局交響樂隊的隊員那裏學習小提琴，他是“二胡”和“鼓”底古典的旋律的演奏者，韓君之弟韓振家君也在這次的演奏中顯示了他的二胡，鐃鈸，　的技藝。其他如曹序震君的二胡，朱文頤君的箏及揚琴，陳　　君的洞簫，均極出色。</p>
<p>在演奏者中如獨唱沈述紈小姐，以及葉大　先生和濮玉小姐的熟練舞劍，增加了中國古典音樂底特有的氣質的表現。</p>
<p>總之，此次演奏會給了大家深刻和難忘的印象，尤其是對於欲知中國古典音樂的秘密的人。</p>

<h3>排球聯賽已展開序幕　各隊球藝應求進步　粵華綠隊表演尚屬可觀</h3>
<p>— 梅潔</p>
<p>三十三年度排球聯賽，已於上週末在中華健身房形開序幕，每逢星期一三五日均有比賽。全部秩序至八月巾句可告絡束。記者參觀以次甲組女組比賽之後，頗覺本屆水準更較以往爲差。不識以指導乏人，抑以球員少訓練所致？在此甚願爲賽初之情形，嗣後能有進境以悅我人則大佳矣。茲評述二賽於后：</p>
<p>上星期日（九日）爲開幕賽，第一塲爲女子組，華人强旅三省隊，逢球藝平庸應聯女將。三省實力堅强，勝利可操，不幸蘇聯竟爾望風披糜，臨陣脫逃。於是三省巾幗，顯成無從，不勞而獲勝，誠掃興事也。</p>
<h3>粵華未見出色　華影更為不振</h3>
<p>另一塲爲甲組粵華戰華影，兩隊俱爲華隊翅楚。星戰無異解決華人巨頭。故雙方俱各鈎心鬥角，獲取勝利。結果粵華總頻人材平均，以三對一力取華影，然已煞費心力矣。觀乎雙方演出，局勢雖見緊湊，成績實難　如人意。攻弱而守疏。　粵華之郭炳坤索之猛擊著。然星戰中極鮮成九，且多越野。華影僅賴譚永港李實中二人維持，其餘諸將，庸弱者多。於是不得不慘敗。粵華之勝，固屬應得。然表演之成績，使人失望。日後遇蘇聯俄僑甲二番隊，照此以往，兇多吉少，不知領隊蕭錫庚將以何訓將士？以擊退胡兒，爭奪冠軍耶？</p>
<p>本週三（十二日）亦有女組及甲組各一塲，均爲中西之門，結果女子組華隊奏旋。甲組則番將得組。</p>
<h3>綠隊初度逞威　壓倒西靑冠軍</h3>
<p>首戰爲緣隊西品紅女子組之戰。西靑紅爲西靑聯賽中之錦標隊，在西靑聯賽中曾壓倒我華女子强伍華蓬　三省等隊，實力殊稱雄厚。綠隊以籃球隊隊基本人員，另相以排球名將黃否芬項毓琳二人。組織伊始，衆料難有佳妙成績。礦是役賽前必以為綠隊失利無疑。蓋綠隊尚有健將二人以病制度也。亟意一以接觸，綠隊即聲勢赫赫汪印蘭之扣殺，王維珍之救險，黃明媛之劈擊，嚴蔚要容淑儉項毓琳之開球，神化異常，乃使番女目瞠口呆、招架乏術。一洗西靑球房中之雌威，連失二局。綠隊勝來輕易。按綠隊排球初路臉，有此成績，殊非易易，而爲我華女吐氣，更足令人愛戰也。甚盼綠隊巾幗，好事以爲，則排球威名，不難與籃球隊之同樣稱期泥上也。</p>
<h3>白隊應勝不勝　俄乙可免嚴軍</h3>
<p>繼爲甲組賽白隊迎俄僑乙。後者爲洋人隊巾之最庸弱者，自隊資格經騐，自不難一鼓而擒。自第一局白隊失去後，即奮發有爲，乃運獲二三兩局。第四后亦估着上風，在二十對十七。勝利已屬囊中物。誰知大意失荊州，遺失五局，反爲俄僑追成各勝二局之局面。最後一局，自隊雖力圖自振，無奈力不從心，終在幾度平等之戰情下而以二十四對二十六慘敗，誠屬不幸。結果三對二，俄僑乙獲勝。親白隊人材與球藝，的是較俄乙爲好，其失敗者，僅在第四局中之一時大意耳。由此以觀。球賽欲獲勝利，無論在如何情况之下，不可放鬆一步也。白隊失敗，亦得到一教訓矣</p>
<h3>足籃球季後談成名新將</h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>本届足藍球季簡巳過，一切精彩之表演，殆成球史之一頁矣。然滬上球類運動，依然如火如茶。唯以趣向小型足球，藉爲球員舒展之機，以待下屆開賽持之不致生疏，有長足之進步表演。茲乘此休憇之際，檢討本屆足籃球中露頭角之新將，爰為記述。所以勉再加鞭，亦示勵後進之努力焉。</p>
<h3>足球新人　二將成名</h3>
<p>本屆各足球隊中，類多老將。即有新人者，大率以經騐關係，究屬較遜一籌。唯下列二將，筆者頗以爲新人中之傑出，確己成名。</p>
<p>左翼李垚</p>
<p>李班季初任東華左翼持，名字陌生，衆料必無作爲。果也，最初之戰，非但球藝尚差，抑且怯塲異常。然李君頗知上進，又經孫錫順之從旁提携，故每塲有顯著之進步。至季末之時，正令人刮目相看，不論其盤，勾，可謂老練之至。與前滬上負有盛名之曹秋亭等相比擬，亦無多讓也。其尤可貴者，以翼位又能利用機會射門，而其射門脚頭，誠成功矣。夫李垚僅有一季之歸大敵，已有如此進步，則來日前途，豈可限量。深望不以此自滿，虛心努力，則異日之成就，豈我•人所可預料者，勉　！</p>
<p>前衛愛面子黎華</p>
<p>在番　（一筆）隊中有華人郁氏昆仲之名字，初當不爲人所汪意。更以黎華年事尚輕，臨戰上陣又少，乃漠不注意及此新將也。待東華戰一警一役中，黎華出任巨艱，付以看管幼良。小郁謹收應付，奮勇作戰，雖未見如何成功，確使幼良受盡牽制，乃遂爲人所注目。於是被選爲中華以及華聯之代表，雖然屬榜上有名，仍未能爲當局重任，以此施展機會仍少。因此總未能得大衆之信仰也。泊乎最末一役，華聯戰葡聯於逸園球塲。是日華聯所到隊員不齊，上半時淸一色東華健兒之中，即雜一郁黎華而已。賽前，經李寗之一番指示，如啟其塞，黎華演出，無一不是處，喧赫於時之福恩，生路毫無。且與東華諸將頗有聯絡，固未能分出其爲隸於二隊，而初度合作之現象，可見黎華年事方輕，正是旭日之中，如能時得老將啟示，黎華之成績，豈僅目下之情况而已。</p>
<h3>籃球後起　亦僅得雙</h3>
<p>本屆籃球隊中，老將固多，後起亦屬不少，惜乎成功者殊鮮有之，則華聯　成軍與仁餘﹝維聽而已。</p>
<p>中鋒吳成章</p>
<p>吳君綽號阿弟，可是其年靑也。極爲華聯隊領導張溎祥君賞識。故季初之戰，即以正式上場。張君以其初臨大敵，乃諄諄指導，不論在賽前賽後，予以各方面之啟蒙。阿弟既耹之下，頗能依教而行。於是球藝日進，且天賦其身段適中，彈力又佳，可謂相得益彰。泊乎季尾，阿弟之中鋒，已無讓於一般老將，而成爲華聯隊中不可少之一員。進步之速，令人飲佩。且阿弟毫無驕氣，預料下季業球賽中，吳成章更能名燥球壇也。</p>
<p>左鋒林維聰</p>
<p>小林爲仁隊中之左鋒。仁餘隊自成立以後，即感前鋒缺乏。是時小林猶混戰於乙組隊伍中，待爲仁徐羅致。以其極肯上進，使任巨艱。然究有蜀中無大將，廖化作前鋒之議。唯有志竟成，信不我欺。小林埋頭苦練，以冀不負重任。酒日新月異，一乎仁餘戰中北一役中，小林生龍活虎，獲分最多。使敵衛呌苦連天。而籃球界中，便成為一有名之前鋒。小林尚在求學時代，環境亦佳。他日威名，指日可待。</p>
<p>按華者記此文，絕無捧塲作用。蓋記者與上述四位健兒，毫不相識，書此僅爲勉勵後起而已。</p>
<h3>花絮</h3>
<p>靑年聯誼社球塲環境優美，餉叹備齊全。計內有排球塲二，籃球塲二小型足球塲一，（可爲網球塲，亦可爲圓門球塲），每球塲四週樹薩密佈，適合看客佇立，實賽球看球之好所在也。據該社彭社長表示，極願介紹與上海體壇，獗迎租借。球隊之好消息也。</p>
<p>本屆中發現之足籃球排棲人材，有張顯崙（足球華通隊，篮球華聯隊，排球白隊）李震中，（藍球中北隊，排球華影隊，小型足球中儲隊）等。洋人亦有浮尼克，依凡諾夫等，致篮排兩樓人材，更指不勝屈矣。</p>
<p>年來球類運動蓬勃之至，如本屆小型足球達一百八十隊之多，實爲好現象。</p>
<p>女排球運動中有十年以上之老將逞威，如綠隊黃杏芬仍不失爲該隊柱石。三省李波且已育有子女甚多，徐娘不讓少艾，乃不禁令人興才難之感，後起者之寥落。</p>

        <h1>1944.07.14</h1>
<h3>ArouSE Common Sense of Air Defense</h3>
<p>In recent months, our city has frequently issued alert warnings and air raid warnings. We believe that as soon as a warning sound is made, from the standpoint of citizens, regardless of whether it is a drill or a real air raid, they must abide by the air defense rules instructed by the air defense authorities and prepare all implementation work. Do not assume it is a drill and be careless; do not assume it is a real air raid and panic. When it is a drill, treat it as a real air raid, which can cultivate the habit of air defense. In case of a real air raid, one can calmly defend and reduce damage.</p>
<p>We are a participating country, and Shanghai is a city of a participating country, and an important city as an economic center in the rear. Therefore, Shanghai's objective status is undeniably a target for enemy air raids. Therefore, we believe that an enemy air raid on Shanghai is a possibility. Of course, it is not to say that enemy planes will attack sooner or later, shaking people's hearts. We are saying that given Shanghai's current situation and environment, being subjected to enemy air raids is something to be expected. In order to reduce the damage to life and property during air raids, we must accept the guidance of the authorities on air defense, abide by the air defense rules, and deal with it calmly.</p>
<p>However, judging from the results of previous air defense drills and the implementation of long-term blackout measures, most citizens have two types of psychology. One is superstition and also a fluke mentality. They believe that enemy planes have various "reasons" for not attacking Shanghai. This is superstition. Or blindly hoping that Shanghai will not be subjected to air raids, this is a fluke. Therefore, they are indifferent to air defense rules. One is a confused psychology. They simply do not know the nature of air raids? They simply do not know how paying attention to air defense is effective during air raids? Therefore, they are ignorant of air defense rules, and even when implementing air defense rules, they think that situations different from peacetime are inconvenient and curse them. These two types of psychology are really undesirable in a wartime city during the current decisive battle period.</p>
<p>Above, we have already pointed out Shanghai's current situation, and it is regrettable that some citizens still have undesirable mentalities. In order to arouse the general public to fully pay attention to air defense rules and do their best to abide by the air defense rules, we will restate the two basic conditions as follows:</p>
<p>The sound symbols of air raid alarms are the most basic common sense of air defense. Every citizen, regardless of age, must clearly understand them. Upon hearing the whistle, one can distinguish what kind of alarm it is and know what to do. Air defense training has been implemented in this city for some time, but the general public still does not know the common sense of distinguishing alarm sound symbols. Alert alarms are often confused with all-clear alarms. The "Common Sense of Air Raid Alarms" schematic table published by this newspaper starting yesterday will be serialized for a week. The table explains the different siren symbols for alert, air raid, and all-clear alarms. We hope that citizens will pay attention together, remember them clearly, parents will instruct their children, shopkeepers will inform their employees, and organizations will create large charts and post them in conspicuous places so that all subordinate employees will know them clearly.</p>
<p>Strictly preventing light leakage is the most basic condition for nighttime air defense. Every household, regardless of whether it is industrial, commercial, or residential, must absolutely abide by it. Even a slight leakage of light makes it easy for enemy planes to locate the target and the direction for attack. Therefore, light leakage during an air raid not only harms oneself but also harms others. On the other hand, preventing light leakage is not difficult, nor is it a major inconvenience. Whether it can be done depends only on whether one pays attention or not. During the control period, if light leaks, one will be subject to penalties such as electricity cuts and fines. Why suffer spiritual and material punishment for a small oversight! We hope that parents, shopkeepers, and responsible persons of organizations will always advise their family members and subordinates to pay attention together and prevent light leakage.</p>
<p>We know that the two air raids by enemy American planes on Kitakyushu, Japan, did not cause major damage, which was due to the thoroughness of air defense training by the local authorities and the strict compliance with air defense rules by the people. Therefore, we should train urgently in order to cope with the current and future environment.</p>
<h3>Fierce and Heroic Battle Unfolds on Saipan Island; Enemy's Deceptive Propaganda Self-Defeats</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Regarding the battle situation on Saipan Island, the enemy army broadcasted via radio that since the 9th of this month, it has been deceiving informed people around the world by fraudulent means, but even if a single soldier remains, the Japanese army will fight to the end and inflict the greatest possible blow on the enemy's offensive. In order to complete the strategic mission on Saipan Island, the island is now rapidly engaging in a fierce and tragic battle that shakes the heavens and moves the ghosts. The enemy side claims that this battle on Saipan Island is the largest and most shocking naval battle in the Pacific. On the 13th, they re-broadcasted Reuters' war report via radio, stating that fierce fighting on Saipan Island is still ongoing. Thus, the boast made by the enemy side to the world on the 9th about occupying the island has been completely forgotten. It is truly a deceptive means to deceive the world that self-defeats. According to the total number of damage announced by the enemy army since the start of the war, the total is 15,053 (including 2,367 killed in action, 11,481 wounded in action, and 1,205 missing), which is very different from the actual number. Another deceptive means can be imagined from this. The enemy American army paid a heavy price and suffered shocking losses for this special attack on the small island of Saipan, which is less than 30 miles in circumference, which fully demonstrates that the American army has no experience and strategy in combat. Our side once said the boast that "The successful capture of Saipan Island is a complete defeat in the Greater East Asia War", but the truth of its losses is kept secret in order to avoid the eyes and ears of the world. However, the skillful battle of the Japanese army will definitely not be shaken by its crazy words. It is firmly believed that in the future, the Japanese army's operations will surely cause the enemy American army on Saipan Island to suffer the same fate as the Battle of Guadalcanal.</p>
<h3>Cabinet Meeting Approves Outline for Mobilizing Scientific and Technical Personnel to Enhance Aircraft and Related Weaponry Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to enhance the combat power centered on aircraft and related weaponry, the Japanese government will resolutely redeploy the active mobilization of scientific and technical personnel. Next, as part of the National Mobilization Plan, it formulated the "Outline for Mobilizing Scientific and Technical Personnel," which was submitted for discussion at the cabinet meeting on the 11th. After State Minister Kishi explained the reasons, it was resolved and passed. The Japanese Information Bureau announced the main points at 2:00 PM on the 13th as follows: The matter of formulating an annual supply and demand plan for scientific and technical personnel. In terms of demand, pay attention to the following matters: production, transportation, communication, construction, scientific medical care, and hygiene technical personnel. In terms of supply, pay attention to the following matters: science school graduates, short-term training of scientific and technical personnel, "targets of mobilization and redeployment" of scientific and technical personnel, and science students above specialized schools (students mobilized while still in school). When formulating the supply and demand plan, pay attention to the following points: Place emphasis on the aircraft industry and related industries, and ensure scientific and technical personnel in radio wave weaponry and other important industrial sectors. In order to adapt to the formulation of this plan, special requests are made for the following measures: (A) In important factories or research institutes, cultivate intermediate scientific and technical personnel in a short period of time. (B) Focus on redeploying existing scientific and technical personnel and utilize outstanding scientific and technical personnel in key areas. (C) Strive to increase the number of science school graduates and allocate them in a planned manner. The plan will be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Active; Achieves Great War Results; Attacks Zhijiang and Guilin Airfields</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing-American Air Force has been very active recently over Hunan. Although they hold great material strength and implement counterattacks, in just eight days, 106 planes were shot down by the Japanese army. After the loss of the Hengyang Airport, the Chongqing-American Air Force retreated to Lingling, but Lingling soon fell. Afterwards, they defended Guilin, attempting to stir up trouble. But on the 9th, Guilin was also bombed, losing 28 planes. Also, on the 8th, Suichuan and Liangshan airfields were severely damaged. Therefore, at present, Japanese planes have launched wave bombings at night, and continue to visit the Chongqing-American Air Force bases during the day. Therefore, the continued activity of the Japanese Air Force has achieved great results.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline Base, 13th (Central News Agency): Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on the Zhijiang Airfield in western Hunan Province, the first-line base of the Chongqing-American Air Force (300 kilometers west of Hengyang) late at night on the 12th, destroying two large Chongqing planes and twenty-four small planes. In addition, twenty-five small planes were also destroyed. The Japanese planes safely returned to their base. Since the fall of the Hengyang Airfield, the Chongqing-American Air Force has used Zhijiang, Guilin, and Danzhu as their first-line bases, but the Japanese planes' bombing operations have not slackened. After attacking Guilin on the 9th, they bombed the Zhijiang Airfield at dawn on the 12th, causing heavy damage.</p>
<p>Japanese General Headquarters Announces Battle Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on July 13th that on the Chinese front, the Japanese Air Force squadron attacked the American Air Force airfield stationed in Chongqing in Zhijiang at dawn on July 12th, destroying or burning two large planes and forty-nine small planes parked on the ground. The Japanese planes returned safely to their defense.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base in China, 13th (Central News Agency): On the 11th, when the Japanese Air Force squadron crossed the Lianjiang River, it used dive bombers to bomb the permanent positions of the Chongqing army on the opposite bank of the river. At the same time, it carried out search attacks on the second-line positions of the Chongqing army in front of Yingde, attempting to prevent the Chongqing army from attacking. The American Air Force, stubbornly attacking, launched an attack on the vicinity of Qingyuan with six bombers of the (豻) type at 9:30 AM on the 12th. The Japanese warplanes and personnel immediately took off and attacked the American planes bombing the area, definitely shooting down one and destroying two. The Japanese army suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Guilin Airfield</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Army Base in China, 13th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on Guilin, the most important forward base of the Chongqing-American Air Force, on the morning of the 10th, causing significant damage. Since the Japanese army arrived in Hengyang, Suichuan, Ganzhou, Lingling, and other bases near the Yuehan Line have been under serious threat. As a result, the Chongqing-American forces recently gathered considerable air force strength in Guilin, attempting to continue the counteroffensive. With Kunming as the headquarters of the Chongqing-American Air Force and Guilin as its heart, the Chongqing-American forces are determined not to lose this important stronghold. Therefore, the Chongqing-American armies have been building day and night in the area for several years. Today, Guilin can be described as a large air force fortress, and from the perspective of the terrain, it has the elements of an air force fortress. Guilin is surrounded by mountains and hills, which can be used to build a large airfield and to use the foothills to build anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun positions to defend against Japanese plane bombings. Moreover, the three airfields and various connecting roads are well-equipped, and the main runways can be arbitrarily taken off by even the super-heavy B29 bombers, which shows the completeness of the facilities. According to a certain captain of the Japanese army who has attacked Guilin several times, the bombing of Guilin this time revealed that the area had changed, which is really surprising. Now the enemy is doing its best to build, so Guilin has been turned into a base that cannot be ignored. On the other hand, the anti-aircraft artillery fire is also extremely fierce. Whenever planes bomb the area, they seem to be wrapped in a net of fire. But the Japanese Air Force is currently attacking this important air force fortress day and night. The night bombing on the morning of the 10th destroyed 28 more aircraft, and will continue to attack fiercely in the future.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Army on the Nu River Front Has Fallen Into a Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Nu River Front, 13th (Central News Agency): Although the Chongqing army on the front line has crossed the Nu River and launched several counterattacks, they have been repelled by the Japanese army. Since the 5th, under the cover of artillery and fighter-bomber squadrons, the Chongqing army attempted to seize Aola Meng, concentrating all its firepower to attack the Japanese army's positions, but after being severely attacked by the Japanese army, they all collapsed. In the five days since the 1st, the Chongqing army left 157 bodies behind. The Japanese army also seized many weapons and foreign drugs. The Chongqing army in Tengyue has also been taking a siege posture since the 5th, intending to advance the Japanese army's stronghold, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army and inflicting heavy damage on them, it has collapsed. Similarly, about 300 Chongqing troops approaching east of Lingling were also defeated. At present, the Chongqing army on the west bank of the Nu River is actually in a dilemma.</p>
<h3>Commander Umezu Hosts Ambassador Chen</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 13th (Central News Agency): Commander of the Kwantung Army and Japanese Ambassador Plenipotentiary to Manchuria, Mr. Umezu, hosted a banquet at his official residence at 6:00 PM on the 12th for Mr. Chen Jicheng, Ambassador Plenipotentiary of our country to Manchuria, and Yang Counselor of the Embassy, Xiao Military Attache Assistant Officer, and all secretarial staff. Commander Umezu personally hosted the event, along with General Kusonoki, the Supreme Advisor to the Kwantung Army, General Yoshioka, Counselor Hanawa of the Japanese Embassy, and others. They held sincere discussions on various topics, including strengthening Sino-Japanese friendship and sincere cooperation. During the banquet, toasts and laughter filled the air, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The banquet did not end until after 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Surprise Attack Occupies Songbai Pavilion; Southern Hunan Has Reached the Decisive Battle Stage</h3>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 13th (Central News Agency): The left-wing attacking unit of the Japanese army occupied Laiyang, 40 kilometers south of Hengyang, without bloodshed on the 4th. They continued to advance south along the Yuehan Line, destroying the disorganized 62nd Army of the enemy everywhere. At dawn on the 11th, they occupied Songbai Pavilion, 60 kilometers south of Hengyang, and are currently continuing their fierce offensive. The Japanese army occupied Songbai Pavilion this time with surprise attack tactics, and captured it without bloodshed. The zinc factory and two lead smelters, and a 300-ton smelting plant for lead products, were completely taken over by the Japanese army. At the same time, none of the factory workers escaped, and they immediately began to assist the Japanese army in their work.</p>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 13th (Central News Agency): In order to echo the left-wing troops surrounding Hengyang and continuing their offensive, a unit of the Japanese army continued to advance fiercely along the western area of the Yuehan Road. They occupied Jinlan Temple on the 7th. The Chongqing 4th Army, 73rd Army, and 48th and 15th Divisions in the northeastern region of Hengyang have fallen into a state of disarray. The Japanese army suddenly launched an attack on them on the 10th, and a large-scale mopping-up operation is currently underway. Due to the rapid advance of the left-wing troops of the Japanese army and the skillful annihilation battle of the left-wing troops, the battle in the southern end of Hunan Province has reached a decisive stage. The Chongqing military leaders are extremely worried about the disastrous defeat in the Sixth War Zone. Jiang Jieshi issued a sad order to the commander of the Sixth War Zone on the 3rd, saying, "Future battles are related to the survival of China. It is hoped that all levels will unite and strive to achieve the final victory. Those who retreat without military orders will be severely punished in accordance with the joint and several liability system."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation in Hunan and Guangdong on the night of the 12th as follows: (1) In the Hunan front line, the external operations of Hengyang have been underway for ten days, and are still continuing. At dawn on the 11th, the Japanese army began shelling again. Although the ground troops repeatedly launched fierce offensives, the Chongqing defending troops fought hard under the cover of the air force, and fierce battles are currently underway. (2) On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army is advancing further eastward from the northeast of Qingyuan (70 kilometers north of Guangzhou), and has now reached the north bank of Lianjiang, 20 kilometers south of Yingde on the Yuehan Line, and is fighting with the intercepting Chongqing army.</p>
<p>American Newspapers Discuss the Chinese War Situation</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing correspondent of the Chicago News recently discussed the war situation on the Chinese front as follows: "After the Japanese army controlled the southeastern Chinese transportation line and attacked Hengyang, it seems to have the intention of quickly advancing towards Guilin. The Japanese army is still continuing to fiercely attack Hengyang. Although the Chongqing defending troops have resisted fiercely, they are holding on to their death with the cover of the Chongqing remnant army. In addition, the Chongqing-American Air Force is attacking the Japanese army's gradually stretched supply lines and its rear bases, bombing and shooting at the front line, attempting to hinder the Japanese army's actions. However, the Japanese army's operations in southern Hunan Province aim to completely occupy most of the Chongqing-American Air Force in southeastern China, so the range of Japanese ship transportation from the air attack on the Chinese coast has been compressed. Also, whether the Chongqing-American Air Force in Guangxi Province can attack the Japanese transport ships passing through the South China Sea and bombing the country remains a question. In this way, where the true intention of the Japanese army lies will depend on how large a force the Japanese army still possesses. But all of this is unknown. Furthermore, this question also touches on whether the Japanese army has the intention of mobilizing its reserve forces to defend the railways it has obtained. According to the first meaning of the Japanese army's offensive, it is to destroy the effectiveness of the Chongqing-American Air Force operating from the southeastern Chinese bases. The second meaning is to obtain the railways and land supply lines reaching the Japanese-occupied territories in the South Seas."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency): The Chongqing United Press special correspondent, regarding the war situation announced by the Chongqing military authorities on the night of the 12th, expressed his feelings as follows: The Japanese army has attacked to a point 40 kilometers away from Qingyuan, putting the key point of the Yuehan Line, Yingde, within the direct attack range. The Chongqing authorities believe that if the Japanese army can occupy Yingde, they can echo the Japanese army in Hunan from north to south, compressing the vast front line to less than 250 kilometers. On the Hunan front, the Chongqing army has attempted to implement a flanking counterattack against the Japanese army, implementing rear operations to restrain the Japanese army's operational plan, but to date, no changes have occurred. The Chongqing military authorities need to revise their view that the crisis in Hunan has passed, given the significant progress of the Japanese army's left wing on the Guangdong front. Furthermore, the report of the Japanese army's general retreat publicized by the Chongqing side last week has now been confirmed as false propaganda.</p>
<h3>War Results of Japanese Army in Mongolia in Mid-June</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 13th (Central News Agency): The war results obtained by the Japanese army and police force stationed in Mongolia in June are as follows: Number of engagements: 49; Communist army strength: 6,004; Destroyed facilities: 113; Captured: 71; Bodies abandoned: 336; Main seized items: 120 rifles, 3,055 rounds of various ammunition.</p>
<h3>Revised Organizational Regulations of the Economic Commission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency): The main purpose of the establishment of the National Economic Commission is to review national economic policies and adjust economic missions. Recently, in order to effectively undertake this important mission, the commission has revised its organizational regulations, which have been approved and promulgated by the Central Political Committee. The organizational regulations stipulate that bureaus should be established to handle the affairs under the commission's jurisdiction. The reporter recently went to the commission to inquire, and was told that the commission originally planned to establish an investigation bureau and a statistics bureau. However, the commission had previously established the Economic Research Institute to handle investigation work. It is now planned to strengthen the investigation work of the institute, and three investigators have been recruited, so it is not planned to establish an investigation bureau again. As for the Statistics Bureau, it was originally planned to be established on July 1st, but it has been postponed due to insufficient preparation. The organizational regulations of the bureau are currently being drafted and will be submitted to the Central Political Committee for approval. The statistics office under the Accounting Office of the Executive Yuan will handle all the accounting work of the various ministries of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Southeast College Board of Directors Established</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency): People in Zhejiang Province who are enthusiastic about education initiated the establishment of a private Southeast College in order to cultivate specialized talents. After active preparation, with the joint efforts of both Chinese and Japanese parties, the board of directors was established on the 10th of this month. The provincial government designated the former site of the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School as the college's address. In addition to the fundraising by the directors, the provincial government will provide a monthly subsidy. Yesterday, the college held its first board meeting, and unanimously elected Director Xu of the Education Department as the chairman of the college's board of directors. The provincial governor, the communication minister, the general consul of Honno, and the original troop commander were invited as advisors. Chen Songqiu, the former principal of the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School, is the honorary advisor. All of the college's organizational charter and recurring budget have been drafted and approved by the board of directors. As for the Provincial Japanese Language Specialized School, it has been ordered to be closed and is currently in the process of being shut down.</p>
<h3>The Impending Decisive Battle Between German Forces and the Enemy in Eastern and Western Europe: Authorities Firmly Believe They Are Fully Prepared</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The decisive phase of the European war is rapidly approaching. Viewing the map alone, it appears extremely unfavorable for the German forces’ prospects. However, the German authorities have consistently maintained their conviction and believe they are fully prepared to guide the war situation. Acting Press Chief Tischner met with a group of international journalists at noon on the 10th and stated that recent propaganda from the anti-Axis camp claimed that German forces had suffered a major blow on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Information Bureau's news is extremely exaggerated, and the German side has repeatedly criticized it. The German authorities view the current retreat as the final stage of that operation. The Soviets have not gained any significant achievements besides acquiring some territory, and their own forces may face a major crisis. In addition, the "Late Evening Post," the official newspaper of Propaganda Minister Goebbels, also stated on the 11th that important battles in the west and east are imminent. As the enemy's resistance increases, they will do their best to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy, while using superior forces to prevent the enemy from advancing. Furthermore, judging from the editorials of the New York Times and other British and American newspapers, they also believe that if the Normandy battle turns into a protracted war, the anti-Axis side will not be able to bear the financial burden. Also, the effectiveness of the new weapon V-1 has now been significantly successful, causing great chaos in the anti-Axis camp, but the German High Command and the entire nation can appreciate the importance of the current situation and are becoming more invigorated.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Expected on Eastern Front Plains</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to front-line news, there are 145 Soviet divisions on the line from Latvia to Plibiya. This large force of Soviet troops is currently moving from a line 18 kilometers west of Dvinsk, 15 kilometers west of Kovno, 56 kilometers west of Grodno, 51 kilometers west of Bialystok, and 7 kilometers west of Minsk. It is rumored that fierce fighting will take place on a straight-line plain. The German authorities also pointed out that as the fighting becomes more intense, the Soviet advance is slowing down, while the German counterattacks are suddenly increasing. A Reuters dispatch on the 12th stated that German resistance near Kovno to Dvinsk is quite strong. The Associated Press also stated that German forces are heavily reinforcing their armored forces.</p>
<p>German Forces Participating in Fighting North of Vyborg</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 12th that German troops in the Lapland area have joined the fighting north of Vyborg.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: The Soviets recently attempted to occupy many rocky islands in Vyborg Bay and Libau Bay. In this battle, German and Finnish coastal defense formations inflicted very heavy losses on the Soviets. The Soviets temporarily occupied the islands of Derkasaari and Merensaari at a heavy price, with over 2,000 casualties. Soviet landing fleets also suffered serious losses from German air force artillery and anti-tank guns.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: German sources told our reporters on Wednesday that the Soviet Union's hopes of quickly defeating Finland have been dashed, as the Soviets have failed to cross the defensive line formed by the lakes north of Vyborg. Unable to break this line, the Soviets are now trying to bypass it and attempt to reach the coastal road to Helsinki by sea. The German assistance to the Finnish army in the battles in Vyborg Bay has proven to be valuable.</p>
<p>Heavy Fighting Continues on Northern French Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 13th that on the 12th, German forces again engaged American forces northeast of Saint-Lô and on the Cotentin Peninsula, completing their defensive objectives. Furthermore, they have retaken important territory south of Carentan.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Führer's Headquarters announced on the 12th that fighting on the Normandy front has expanded to several areas, and artillery fire has become more intense. East of the Orne River, German forces have repelled the anti-Axis forces that had broken into Colombelles back to their original positions. Southwest of Caumont-l'Éventé, German forces launched a counterattack and retook some territory. Fierce fighting is continuing in the area of Jurques. West and southwest of Tilly, German forces defeated strong anti-Axis forces attacking the Saint-Lô northeast and northern Axis forces, launching a breakthrough offensive on a wide front. German forces are determined to destroy their attempt and are still engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy. West of Juréel, German tank units have driven the anti-Axis forces north. Fierce offensive and defensive battles are taking place between Villy and Saint-Aignan, northwest of Rubercy, and in the La Haye area.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) – According to the Associated Press: German forces in the area south of Caen launched a counterattack with elite mechanized units, resulting in the recapture of a village on the road from Cauvicourt to Chitot. Furthermore, to coordinate with friendly forces in the Saint-Lô area, German forces in that area are poised to launch a large-scale counteroffensive.</p>

<h3>Flour and Wheat Association Increases Special Flour Allocation: Striving to Find Ways to Allocate Flour to Households</h3>
<p>At this time of serious food shortages, the household allocation of flour and special allocations to various industries are of great concern to all sectors of society. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to Sun Zhongli, chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, who said: "Since the Association began managing the unified allocation of flour and bran, it has been a year. Allocations to various benefit levels have been made on time without interruption. Even at this time between harvests, when rice and grain are in short supply, we are doing our best to find ways to allocate flour to households and are adding half a catty of corn flour per period to partially supplement the people's food supply. Recently, the demand from various noodle product industries has increased, and a small number of operators have not hesitated to lower prices to buy flour, resulting in a black market for flour. As the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, we should plan comprehensively and manage rationally to increase the quantity of allocated flour, with a particular focus on popular noodle products, such as flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles, to ensure that the allocation meets actual needs. Fortunately, this year's wheat harvest is stable, and wheat from producing areas has already entered the market. The Association's purchasing work has already begun, and all flour mills can start operating at full capacity. The production of flour and bran is expected to gradually increase thereafter, and there should be no shortage."</p>
<h3>Economic Section Officers of the Second Police Bureau to Wear Armbands</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen economic policing, the Second Police Bureau of the Shanghai Special City has decided that economic section personnel of the Bureau's Second Division, who previously did not have clear identification when going out to investigate, making it easy for abuses to occur, will now be issued numbered and stamped armbands for wear, in order to provide identification and prevent imposters from taking advantage of the situation to harass the people.</p>
<h3>Security Transfer in the North Bridge District</h3>
<p>Security in the North Bridge District of this city is currently being transferred by friendly nations. It is understood that in order to express fervent celebration, the District Office has specially scheduled a North Bridge District Security Transfer Celebration Conference for 9 a.m. tomorrow (the 15th) in Minhang Town, North Bridge District. At that time, relevant heads of agencies will attend the conference.</p>
<h3>Stocks Falling Below Par Value to be Ordered into Liquidation: Thorough Investigation of Company Accounts to Prevent Speculation</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Chinese stock market in Shanghai, the original intention was to promote the revival of investment enterprises and promote the development of industrial and commercial enterprises. Unexpectedly, some operators have turned investment into speculation, especially by falsely setting up companies to raise funds through the issuance of stocks. Since the beginning of this year, the stock market has been in decline, and stock prices have plummeted, becoming increasingly severe. Outsiders have suffered huge losses due to the stock market crash, and dozens of stocks have even fallen below their par value. Although this situation is due to tight credit, the biggest problem is caused by speculators, as well as companies with unsound internal organization and no actual business, leading to a lack of confidence among shareholders. Recently, Huacheng Industrial Co., Ltd., founded by Zhang Shanxian and others, noted that although the company's stock is not listed for trading, the black market price has also fallen to between four and five yuan, which has a significant impact on the company's reputation. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of shareholders, the company decided to convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on July 31 to discuss voluntary liquidation, and after selling the company's assets separately, to fully recover the par value of the issued stocks in order to demonstrate its creditworthiness. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to Yang Changkang, the company's manager, who said that the company has been established for six months, with a capital of 50 million yuan. Its business scope includes real estate, a machine factory, and investment in China Electric Factory. Although it has not made much profit in the past six months, its assets are not in deficit. The company's original plan was to continue operating, but the recent severe decline in the black market value of the company's stock has affected the company's reputation. Therefore, in order to maintain the reputation of the founders and the interests of shareholders, it was decided to sell the company's assets and fully refund the par value of the stock. According to sources familiar with the matter, the government authorities, in view of the stock market decline and the special relationship with the company, conducted an investigation and found that many listed companies, especially those with stocks falling below par value, had unsound internal organization, empty assets, or no actual production. Allowing their stocks to continue to be listed would have a significant impact on the social economy and the interests of shareholders. Therefore, the authorities will conduct a thorough investigation of the accounts of the above-mentioned listed companies, and once any violations are found, they will be ordered to liquidate, recover the stocks, and refund the par value to avoid abuses and eliminate speculation.</p>
<h3>Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The Necessity of National Cooperation</p>
<p>The temporary rice and grain measures announced by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee were originally intended to encourage the transportation of rice and grain from the interior to Shanghai, and it was particularly declared that unlimited transportation would be permitted until the announcement of the completion of the moving-in preparations. However, as mentioned above, the county governments in the interior have taken the attitude of: "That won't work. If Shanghai adopts this policy, the interior will have to adopt a policy of completely restricting the outflow of rice from the interior." This is a serious problem that cannot be taken lightly. The tendency for Shanghai to become alienated from the rural areas of the interior is already concerning, and the conflict between the policies of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the county governments in the interior during the period between harvests must be resolved as soon as possible. Unlimited transportation is not unplanned transportation. Due to the defensive measures taken by the county governments, it is difficult to hope that individual carriers will bring in more rice and grain than they are currently bringing in. Therefore, the hope is that mass transportation with official passports can be successfully facilitated.</p>
<p>Rice merchants generally want to buy from regions with convenient access and low market prices and transport rice and grain to Shanghai. Therefore, without examining whether or not it is possible, they ask the Rice Control Committee to issue passports for the maximum amount.</p>
<p>As a result, this has fueled uncontrolled competition among rice merchants and threatened the amount of food available for local consumption in the interior. Those issuing passports cannot believe that the full amount will definitely be transported to Shanghai. The Rice Control Committee finds it difficult to plan the amount to be purchased from each county, taking into account the necessary amount for local consumption in each county and the necessary amount for consumption in Shanghai. As a result, restrictions are added when issuing passports, but these are only minor issues such as whether the rice merchants applying for passports are qualified. The needs of each county and the needs of Shanghai may not be comprehensively and systematically considered. If this is the case, it is not rice and grain control, but rice and grain uncontrolled.</p>
<p>Now is the period between harvests, and planned control during this period is absolutely necessary. The work of the Rice Control Committee has already shifted from working alone to working together with the municipal government. The situation has developed to the point where emergency countermeasures regarding rice and grain transportation must be agreed upon between the Rice Control Committee and the municipal government, as well as the provincial and county governments, and work must be promoted on the basis of complete consensus. The only way to solve the problems of quantity and price is not free movement, but planned action during the period between harvests.</p>
<p>As this reporter has already stated, all consumer cities are implementing rice and grain control. In each consumer city, the distribution responsibility of the county government during the period between harvests should at least be planned as part of the rice and grain policy. However, this proposal has not been implemented, reportedly because of the abstract theory that "rice and grain policy should be unified by the Rice Control Committee" and the concrete concern that "when each county government allows the distribution of rice, it will hinder the Rice Control Committee from ensuring the targeted purchase amount." A reporter who has witnessed the actual situation in various places during the period between harvests sees that the interior is encountering an unprecedented rice and grain shortage, and the Rice Control Committee office is doing nothing, only trying to overcome this difficulty by positioning itself as an administrative agency. We know that the abstract concept of "rice and grain control should be handled by the Rice Control Committee" at the beginning is no longer maintained. Leaders of rice and grain policy agencies should negotiate proper handling of concrete issues regarding rice and grain movement with provincial and county governments in the interior. The provisions and statements on free movement in rice and grain policy agencies, no matter how high-sounding they are, if rice and grain does not move, can the citizens of Shanghai survive by eating provisions? Those in charge of rice and grain policy, listen: Now is the time to make the greatest effort to adjust the rice and grain situation between Shanghai and the interior.

<h3>Essentials of Air Raid Shelter Construction</h3>
<p>Where Should It Be Built?</p>
<p>First, study the question of where it is best to build. Should it be built outdoors or indoors? It is generally believed that building it indoors eliminates the risk of rainwater flowing in, and it is also more convenient to use at night or in cold weather. Moreover, building it indoors makes it easier to see incendiary bombs falling on the building and to take action and carry out emergency fire prevention work.</p>
<p>Then, when building indoors, is it better on the floor or under the floor? Because it is lower, it is naturally safer under the floor than on the floor. Moreover, soil is a good covering material. Digging a hole under the floor and spreading a mat or bed board can immediately be used as a shelter. This is one of the most convenient methods.</p>
<p>What is said above is generally safe. Of course, there are also cases where it is better to build on the floor depending on the circumstances of each room, and there are also cases where it is better to build outdoors. These should all be based on the circumstances of each location.</p>
<p>Indoor Shelter</p>
<p>How should an indoor underground shelter be built? Here is a simple example: digging a hole under the floor that is just enough to hide the body will make a good shelter. The depth of the hole only needs to be enough to lie prone. Also, in the event that a bomb falls nearby, various objects may fall down due to the shock, and the floor becomes a natural covering, which is indeed very convenient.</p>
<p>At this time, the construction should not damage the building, so a hole should be dug about three centimeters from the foundation of the building.</p>
<p>Originally, sheltering does not have to be for a long time, so when building a shelter, due to the lack of materials, the use of a lot of materials and labor should be avoided. It doesn't matter if the slope is a little off in hard soil. The form does not have to be fixed. The simpler the better, so it depends on the situation of each family.</p>
<p>But if you have materials on hand, use them. Of course, it is better to use planks and earth, or to spread mats. When digging under the floor, if there is water underground, or if it is not possible to dig to a depth sufficient to lie prone because of gas pipes or water pipes underground, soil can be used around the hole to make up for the depth.</p>
<h3>National Mandatory Labor Corps to Depart for Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Mandatory Labor Corps is scheduled to gather 200 corps members at the corps headquarters at 8 a.m. on the 16th of this month. The corps members will be divided into four teams, each wearing an armband and carrying the necessary tools, and will depart for the seventh district to clear garbage, repair roads, and cultivate wasteland. It is reported that, in addition to the Second Police Bureau ordering the various branches of the Nanshi Yimiao Zhongbi Road and Xiqiao to dispatch sanitation officers and police to assist, China Film Culture Studio will also send personnel to shoot newsreels.</p>
<h3>Accounts of the North China Emergency Relief Fund Submitted for Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles North China Emergency Relief Association, which was established in June of last year to handle North China emergency relief matters, concluded its operations in February of this year. All income and expenditure accounts, account books, vouchers, and other related documents were transferred to Xu Shuizuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan, three accountants, for a joint audit. The audit has now been completed, and a report has been prepared and submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for record.</p>
<h3>Sports Competitions Subject to Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>A notice issued by the First District Public Office states: It has been found that various charitable organizations, groups, schools, etc., in this district often hold sports competitions or other performances in order to raise funds, and have repeatedly submitted requests to the office for exemption from entertainment tax. It has been found that this entertainment tax is paid by the audience and is not borne by the organizing body, so there is no need to request exemption. In order to adjust tax revenue, all sports competitions or other performances held in the future to raise funds will be subject to the entertainment tax as usual, and the entertainment tax will continue to be calculated together with the ticket price. If the organizing body has financial difficulties, it may submit a separate application to the office for a subsidy in order to show restriction and importance of tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Paintings by Disciples of Meijing Study Donated to Aid Education</h3>
<p>More than 30 disciples of Meijing Study recently held a calligraphy and painting exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Xizang Road, which runs from yesterday to the 18th. The Meijing Study is another name for the famous Shanghai painter Wu Hufan. Wu's calligraphy and painting are well-known in his time. The disciples all have insights. The exhibition is enriched by the instructions of their master. Among the works, the four large screens of flowers painted jointly by all 34 disciples are the most precious. It was publicly agreed that the proceeds from the sale of the painting, after deducting advertising costs, would be donated in full to this newspaper's education fund to benefit the poor students. This is commendable. Readers are encouraged to visit and purchase the paintings, which will help the students and provide excellent enjoyment. It is reported that on the first day yesterday, Mr. Xia was willing to purchase it for 80,000 yuan, but stated that anyone willing to pay more than 80,000 yuan could bid for it.</p>
<h3>News of Readers' Aid to Education</h3>
<p>Deadline for Collecting Registration Certificates Tomorrow</p>
<p>The registration certificates issued by the Readers' Aid to Education Office of this newspaper to each applicant student, totaling more than 600 schools, or more than 8,000 certificates, have been collected in succession on the previous two days. Currently, there are still more than 40 schools remaining, and they are limited to collecting their certificates by presenting their receipts to the office by today and tomorrow, after which they will be invalid. The registration certificates received by each school should be distributed to each student for safekeeping within two days, as the qualification examination will be held within ten days. Once the examination date and location are determined, they will be announced. It is hoped that all applicant students will pay attention to the "News of Readers' Aid to Education" published in this newspaper every day so as not to miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Kunfan Girls' High School Raises Funds to Aid Education</p>
<p>The teachers and students of Kunfan Girls' High School launched a fund-raising campaign for education assistance during the school's anniversary. They donated 50,000 yuan to this newspaper's education fund. This is deeply meaningful and commendable. The letter is transcribed below: We are writing to inform you that May 28 of this year is the 26th anniversary of our school. Considering the difficult times, we dared not celebrate extravagantly. However, the teachers and students of our school, lamenting the decline of the social economy and the increasing number of poor children who are unable to attend school, launched a school-wide fundraising campaign to establish a loan fund for education, with the aim of caring for the school and cultivating talent. We went out in groups of four to solicit donations, and so far, we have accumulated 194,463 yuan. However, it seems that using this amount solely for our own school's purposes would be too limited in scope to be truly widespread. Therefore, we have decided to contribute 50,000 yuan from the aforementioned amount to your newspaper's education fund, and 50,000 yuan to the News Newspaper's office. The remaining 94,463 yuan will be used for the expenses of the Fuming Free School established by our school's high school students after school, and as loan fund for poor students at our school. We are sending a check for 50,000 yuan from the Far Eastern Bank, and we would be grateful if you could acknowledge receipt and provide a receipt. Sincerely, Kunfan Girls' High School, July 13.</p>
<p>Donations received yesterday: Kunfan Girls' High School, 50,000 yuan. Remaining balance: 6,826,524 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Increased Aircraft Production</h3>
<p>— Iijima Masayoshi, Army Colonel</p>
<p>"Send as many aircraft to the front lines as possible, even one more is good." Because the people, in response to this slogan, have risen up, sacrificing their lives and dedicating their total strength to increasing aircraft production, the total number of new aircraft contributed by the entire nation with utmost sincerity has accumulated to over four thousand several hundred.</p>
<p>The people's cooperation in increasing aircraft production will naturally not fully achieve the purpose of increased production if it is merely lip service from those involved. In addition to having a correct understanding of the essence of aircraft, it is also necessary to be aware of the significance of increased production and to cooperate in increased production voluntarily. Only then will the term "increased production" be substantial rather than just empty words.</p>
<p>Aircraft Consumption is Huge</p>
<p>Currently, aircraft, like those of all countries, are not like the large cannons or rifles on land in past wars, which could be used for years and years. They are usually consumed in very short periods of time due to massive combat and natural attrition. The amount of combat attrition each month varies depending on the war situation, and the exact figures will have to wait for the statistics released by various countries after the war. However, the ratio of aircraft shot down by the British and American air forces in the bombing of Europe, and by the German air force, is often between five and seven percent per thousand aircraft, sometimes reaching fifteen percent. If the reports in newspapers and on the radio are true, then on the battle lines where we engage in fierce aerial combat with equal strength, the total damage from being shot down and destroyed will undoubtedly be significant in a single month, which is conceivable.</p>
<p>On the other hand, natural attrition includes not only those that can no longer be used due to the end of their lifespan, but also those that are involved in accidents during takeoff and landing, and those that have to make forced landings. Therefore, not only the front-line units, but also the education and training units in the country, often have varying attrition rates due to factors such as the quality of the airfields, the difficulty of the flying requirements, the frequency of use, the skills of the pilots, and the maintenance capabilities, and cannot be generalized. However, there are quite a few that cannot be ignored. Generally, the impact on domestic education and training units is small; while the impact on front-line units using poor airfields and those that cannot be controlled properly due to enemy fire is large. The aircraft of each aviation unit are being consumed in this way. Therefore, if we assume that there is no replenishment at all after days of fierce aerial combat, the number of aircraft dispatched will gradually decrease each time, and will soon become zero. In order to maintain combat strength during war, replenishment must be carried out rapidly at a rate that cannot be compared with land weapons.</p>
<p>Among the aircraft that are consumed daily, there are naturally many that reach the end of their lifespan without sudden accidents. The lifespan of aircraft, especially engines, is very short. After they are manufactured, they cannot be used for two or three years. Even warships and merchant ships, after being used for a certain period of time, must enter dry dock for major repairs, let alone sophisticated aircraft?</p>
<p>Engine Lifespan</p>
<p>The lifespan of an engine, that is, the question of how long it can be used, depends on the quality of the materials, the size of the reliability, and varies depending on the aircraft type and model. Generally, after each engine has a lifespan of five or six hundred hours and becomes unusable, in addition to being treated as waste, it is usually sent to a repair factory to use the reusable parts and remanufacture them.</p>
<p>Aircraft not only have such a short lifespan, but also often become ill and die young during their short existence. Therefore, in order to diagnose in advance to remove the source of the disease, during the period of use, the parts that are prone to failure must be inspected at certain intervals, and the weakened parts must be replaced to maintain health. The more frequent these regular inspections, and the longer each one takes, the fewer aircraft in the unit's inventory can be deployed. Therefore, in order to prevent the reduction in deployment rate due to regular inspections, ideally, it is naturally best to increase the reliability of the equipment so that such regular inspections are unnecessary. And to increase reliability, from the raw materials to the manufacturing process of the finished product, one must concentrate on every minute detail without any flaws or errors, and strictly check its quality. And aircraft composed of parts with greater reliability will inevitably have a longer lifespan. Endo, the director of the Army Air Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, often advocated manufacturing "aircraft infused with soul," and half of the reason lies in this.</p>
<p>In addition, increasing the ease of handling of each part not only plays a significant role in shortening the working hours of regular inspections, but is also a necessary condition for shortening maintenance time. This improvement in reliability, the improvement of the assembly method, and the increase in ease of handling are increasing the deployment rate and advancing along the line of increased production. But whether it is regular inspection or daily maintenance, the prerequisite is that there must be sufficient spare parts and tools. Without this, simple repairs and adjustments cannot be implemented, and the aircraft will not be usable until it is replenished.</p>
<p>Calling for increased aircraft production and competing to manufacture perfect aircraft with all production capacity is common to human nature, regardless of the enemy or ourselves. Producing spare parts and producing perfect aircraft simultaneously is also increasing the number of aircraft deployed and advancing towards the goal of increased production.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in order to maintain the combat strength of the front-line units, a large number of replenishment is necessary. And this replenishment is often urgently needed by the front-line units, and gradually extends to the rear. If, on the contrary, domestic production is used as the fan's eye and the front line as the fan's surface, and replenishment aircraft are deployed and supplied, then at a certain period of time, great combat strength may be exerted, but the result will eventually be a flash in the pan. Therefore, when the number of aircraft on the front line increases by one, the rear must increase several times the number of replenishment aircraft.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Aircraft to Replenish Units</p>
<p>Increased production aircraft are used in this way to maintain the combat strength of the first-line and rear training units, and only when there is surplus capacity can new units be created or expanded. These surplus aircraft are formed into new units and dispatched to the required battle lines.</p>
<p>However, the creation and addition of new units is not as simple as saying it, and requires a considerable amount of time. That is, newly established units must train the necessary unit commanders and air force personnel, and in order to deploy these units, it is necessary to set up the required battlefields and the required fuel and ammunition, and then the newly established units can be dispatched to the front line.</p>
<p>And the increase in newly established units, needless to say, the number of replenishment aircraft must increase accordingly, but the increased production must maintain an average. If the replenishment is not smooth and fluctuations in the combat strength of the front-line units occur, then when the combat strength is low, there is a risk of being taken advantage of by the enemy.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because increased production is hoped to increase the number of aircraft deployed on the front line, simply increasing the number of aircraft and creating aircraft that cannot fly cannot achieve its purpose. Improving reliability and ease of handling, and replenishing an appropriate amount of spare parts, are extremely related to increasing the number of aircraft deployed. Recognizing and considering this point, and seeking to increase the number of aircraft produced, is the real increase in production. Moreover, in today's world, where the number of aircraft produced in factories cannot be expanded infinitely due to the state of domestic resources in various countries, the need to re-examine the concept of increased production is increasingly felt.

<h3>Bloody Battle Record of Japanese Submarine in the Waters of the Marshall Islands</h3>
<p>According to the White Paper on April 16, near the Marshall Islands, a submarine commander, Major So-and-so, who bravely struck and destroyed an enemy large aircraft carrier, thus establishing a miraculous feat, wrote the following bloody record:</p>
<p>Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so "Dear wife and children! We are the bulwark of the Empire. Let's exchange our lives for merit!" At 11:00 am, the main engine was started. I came to the bridge and saw the majestic main engine, breathing out air. The loud "prepare to depart" sound of the horn had already resounded through the sky. The submarine quietly left the coast. Ah, what a beautiful sunny day with gentle breeze and warm sunshine!</p>
<p>It is the sea of the third expedition. Although the waves are high, submarines can be fearless.</p>
<p>Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. Although today is also cloudy, the waves are small, so there is no need to submerge, which is a cause for celebration that is worth thanking God for. In such a celebratory atmosphere, I thought silently about "The Theory of Submarine Warfare Hunting."</p>
<p>Departing to Hunt</p>
<p>Submarines go out to disrupt traffic, just like going out to hunt. There are also large-scale hunts, so there must be sufficient armament and meticulous preparation plans. When implementing this plan, you have to climb mountains and cross ridges, cross rivers and enter places where no one has ever been. You have to set up camps and fight against wild beasts such as insects, wolves, tigers, etc. If large carnivores such as lions and tigers come, you immediately pounce on them and kill them. After killing them, you immediately prepare to deal with the attacks of other wild beasts. In this situation, we humans are not always the victors, and sometimes we often sacrifice some people. Of course, you have to endure hardship, hunger and thirst, but the moment you capture the spoils is very happy. This is the reason why you go hunting regardless of all the hardships. Submarine warfare is warfare for the sake of warfare. You often sneak to the vicinity of enemy aircraft, patrol boats, etc., and hit them with one blow. The bigger the target, the more enjoyable it is. To achieve this goal, you have to fight against the sweltering heat and severe cold, as well as the suffocating air inside the submarine, and you have to endure all kinds of inconveniences and constant pain for days on end. Just as there are hunters who lose their lives because of hunting beasts, submarines are of course sometimes unfortunately killed by the enemy. If you always pay attention to such things, you can't do anything. The opponents of us submarine crew members are just like wild beasts.</p>
<p>Preparing Torpedoes</p>
<p>Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the operating waters, I ordered the preparation of torpedoes. It took three days and two nights to complete the preparation. I stared at the silver-white torpedo rays and thought: The torpedoes that have been manufactured solemnly must be launched solemnly to achieve the supreme combat results.</p>
<p>The operating waters are gradually approaching, and it is necessary to submerge during the day, so the meal times cannot be normal. When departing, breakfast is at 7:00 am, lunch is at 11:45 am, and dinner is at 5:15 pm. After 8:00 pm, you still have to eat a late-night snack. However, now breakfast is at 3:00 am, lunch is at 5:00 pm, and dinner is at 9:00 pm. The late-night snack like before has been changed to be eaten at 11:00 am. In addition, the sleeping time has been almost completely changed. I sleep when I submerge in the morning. I only get up to eat and go to the toilet. When I can't fall asleep, I read novels or something like that. Because I don't know when I will safely discover the enemy at night, I am of course not allowed to sleep. So when the dawn breaks, I can't hold on anymore, so I sleep. Night is my active stage. Now I must go and take a look.</p>
<p>Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. After our submarine arrived at the operating waters, several days have passed, and I feel that it is also hindering me to meet the enemy. But the easterly wind has been very strong for days, and the wave height is about two meters. When our submarine is sailing sideways, it shakes very violently. If we encounter the enemy like this, the attack will be a little difficult, and everyone is worried about this. The fresh food has been used up, and we are only eating canned food every day.</p>
<p>Month So-and-so, Day So-and-so. As a result, we didn't meet the enemy today either. I am really unlucky, and some people are even unhappy. Of course, it is not driven by impatience and a desire for fame, but because I want to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>The torpedo tube room is filled with the blue-white color of fluorescent lamps. Many torpedoes have not yet obtained their spoils of war. I think in my heart that if these torpedoes do not hit the enemy, they will never return to base. The torpedo tube room is all configured very neatly.</p>
<p>Discovering the Enemy Ship</p>
<p>April 16</p>
<p>In the pre-dawn darkness, the lookout spotted something resembling an enemy aircraft. We immediately began to submerge. So we passed by without any danger. After noon, the radio operator said: "Piston sound detected at right ○○ degrees ○". So I ordered "Take your positions"! I ran to the command tower and looked through the periscope. Something faint appeared in my eyes. At azimuth left ninety degrees, there was a destroyer guarding, carefully drawing white waves, and at left one hundred and twenty degrees, an aircraft carrier was sailing. The distance was ○ kilometers.</p>
<p>In the stormy sea, the periscope immediately became ineffective. If I wanted to wait for calm, our submarine would float up due to the large waves. I, who was holding the periscope, was greatly frightened. At that time, I naturally had no time to measure the distance and speed of the enemy ship, and sweat even flowed into my eyes.</p>
<p>The enemy aircraft carrier seen through the periscope suddenly changed direction in front of me and went back. Ah, I knew in my heart that this was recovering aircraft back to base. The aircraft flying horizontally from the left to the right of the periscope's field of vision were preparing to land on the carrier. Suddenly, the aircraft carrier reduced its speed. I, who was carefully watching, decided to order a torpedo attack. The distance from the large aircraft carrier was already sufficient for a torpedo attack. So I ordered a torpedo attack through the speaking tube. I thought, "It's really God's blessing that we can carry out a successful attack."</p>
<p>The destroyer that had previously taken a considerable angle with our submarine suddenly changed direction. The azimuth was zero degrees, heading directly towards our submarine.</p>
<p>The distance was ○ kilometers. I felt as if cold water had been poured over my head. I felt that the enemy ship might have already discovered our submarine, and even wanted to escape, so I retracted the periscope into the water. But I thought of the pain and hardship I had endured before, and it would be meaningless to escape. So I thought that since we had been discovered, we had to attack with depth charges, otherwise there would be no way. My determination was made, and I issued another order to raise the periscope. But the destroyer's azimuth was still zero degrees. I thought in my heart that the enemy was finally coming. If I let go of this opportunity, the chance to attack would not come again.</p>
<p>Hitting the Enemy Ship</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, I aimed at the aircraft carrier. Enemy aircraft carrier, please take our sanitary pill! Then go deep into the seabed and be buried in the belly of the fish. So I decided to order the launch of the torpedoes. After launching, we retreated to a deep sea ○○ meters away. We heard two torpedoes hitting. I saw the faces of all the crew members were joyous, and I, as the commander of the submarine, was even happier.</p>
<p>Later, the enemy ship's movements suddenly changed. Sometimes it stopped, sometimes it sailed at high speed, sometimes it carried out depth charge attacks on the distant sea, and sometimes it passed over our submarine with a shrill sound. In short, it continued to carry out all kinds of strange actions. So for four hours, we sat quietly and listened carefully to the enemy ship's movements. Later, I heard one warship leaving, and another warship gradually heading north. I did not think that we had completely escaped the enemy ship's pursuit when I saw night falling on the sea. We quickly replenished the electricity and put air into the submarine, and at the same time strictly ordered surveillance of the enemy ship, and began to submerge again.

<h3>Situation on the Western European Battlefield</h3>
<p>On the night of June 5, the anti-Axis forces concentrated about 1,000 bombers to bomb the Atlantic fortress area in northern France. The bombing became more intense at midnight, and the bombing range also expanded from coastal fortresses to the assembly points of the German army's reserve forces in the rear. At around 1:00 am on the morning of the 6th, the anti-Axis air and airborne troops began landing on the islands of Guessey and Jersey, in the area between the mouths of the Seine and Orne rivers, and on the eastern coast and tip of the Cotentin Peninsula. The German army immediately rose up to attack and sweep them away. Afterwards, the anti-Axis amphibious forces landed on the coastal area from Le Havre to Cherbourg and built a bridgehead in the lower reaches of the Orne River, but almost all of the British airborne troops who landed initially were wiped out in battle. On the 7th, under the fierce covering fire of naval guns, the anti-Axis forces established a second bridgehead in the Bayeux area and its western area. Afterwards, both sides mobilized reinforcements and launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle centered on the area between the Orne and Vire rivers and the base of the Cotentin Island.</p>
<p>According to German Ambassador to Japan Stahmer, the forces invading Europe under the command of Montgomery included approximately twenty-seven divisions, including ground troops and paratroopers. In addition, British Prime Minister Churchill announced after the start of the invasion of Europe that the anti-Axis forces had assembled more than 4,000 ships of all sizes in the waters of the English Channel, and thousands of small boats. However, since the British army retreated in disarray from Dunkirk in July 1940, Germany had already built strong fortresses in the northern coast of France with the most advanced technology and the latest designs, and stationed battle-hardened elite troops there. After landing, the anti-Axis forces were immediately pursued by the German army everywhere and suffered heavy losses. Although they have been fighting hard for more than a month, they still have not achieved much. Looking back at the North France battle situation over the past month, will the leaders of the anti-Axis forces also sigh "it's not worth the loss"?</p>
<p>In recent days, the German army has been conducting a successful counter-offensive on the European front, and each operation has been able to inflict heavy losses on the enemy and contain their advance. The places where the enemy has broken through are often quickly recovered by the German army. The German soldiers have excellent tactics. Yesterday, German armored grenadiers, in Caen's west, repelled the attacking British infantry, one against ten, and finally won the victory. A German isolated army northwest of Caen heroically fought and recovered the village of Epron, but the result was still taken away by the enemy. The enemy's successive offensives have been frustrated by the German army's counter-offensives. For example, between Vire and Taute, every time the British army wanted to launch an offensive, the German army would launch an attack in time, preventing it from succeeding. The British army suffered setbacks in the battles in Balleroy and other places. Montgomery currently has 32 well-equipped divisions conducting a large offensive, with thousands of aircraft assisting in the battle, fiercely bombing the German army's positions, but the German army is still able to hold its positions and has not wavered. Although the enemy made their best efforts yesterday, they made very little progress.</p>

<h3>Preparation for the Invasion War</h3>
<p>After the British retreat from Dunkirk in 1940, they made a comeback and prepared to land. However, at that time, the British mainland only had one fully equipped division, which was insufficient to withstand a German attack. If the Germans had invaded the British mainland at that time, Britain would have undoubtedly been defeated. In June 1941, the German-Soviet war broke out, and the Germans concentrated all their efforts on the Eastern Front, which eased the crisis in the British mainland. At the end of that year, the United States also joined the war, and the dream of "invading Western Europe" began to feel realistic.</p>
<p>The British military authorities, in order to draft and implement a concrete plan, first ordered Mountbatten, General Blamey, and Air Vice-Marshal Douglas to study the general strategy against the Axis forces. However, they encountered various contradictions, especially the lack of materials, which prevented the plan from being finalized. Later, in the summer of 1942, Roosevelt and Churchill held talks in Washington and reached an agreement on the idea of "implementing the invasion."</p>
<p>At the Casablanca Conference in North Africa in January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill tacitly decided to launch the invasion in mid-1944, and that year they would devote themselves to the Mediterranean campaign in order to destroy the main force of Italy. By the Quebec Conference in Australia in August of that year, the date of the invasion was largely decided, and the British and American military authorities studied the operational plan in detail at the conference.</p>
<p>In January of this year, General Eisenhower of the United States replaced the British general in command, and the plan was revised to make it more concrete, but the final decision on the landing date was still a very recent matter. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, June 14)</p>

<h3>Aunt Chen</h3>
<p>— Yun Sheng</p>
<p>A few days ago, my cousin came out from our hometown and told me that Aunt Chen was very old and had become a grandmother. At the same time, her son, A Bao, had made much more progress than before. The mention of Aunt Chen made me think of her pitiful life.</p>
<p>Six years ago, when the flames of war reached my family's garden house, only Aunt Chen leaned on the bamboo garden fence behind the house and secretly shed a few tears.</p>
<p>Aunt Chen had a thin face, a pointed chin, a nose slightly like an eagle's claw, and a short stature. She was my family's old servant. If it weren't for the war, she would never have left my family, starting from my grandfather's generation. In her history of helping out, there was no second employer. No one in our family disliked her. Even when my grandfather divided the family property among his five sons, my uncles secretly argued over the right to inherit her. Each family seemed to have the ambition to protect her for themselves. Who knew that she would inform my grandfather and choose our eldest son's family (my father was my grandfather's eldest son).</p>
<p>Her wisdom and talent made her more trustworthy than other servants. She could guess the master's needs and arrange them early. She could remind the master of neglected trivial matters... Everything in the family, whether big or small, rough or fine, once it passed through her hands, was in good order and in its place. What powerful help this was to my father, who traveled far away, and my mother, who was frail and often ill!</p>
<p>"Look! Aunt Chen in the eldest son's family is worth three or four servants in other people's families. She is quick in her work, honest, and patient..." My aunts often cast envious and jealous glances at my family.</p>
<p>One cold winter noon, I came back from school (elementary school). Aunt Chen did not serve at lunch, which I found very strange. My mother told me that her husband, Chen Wenfu, had frozen to death in a straw shed by the East River, and Aunt Chen had gone to collect his body.</p>
<p>In the evening, Aunt Chen dragged her tired body back, showing an expression of frustration that was rarely seen on ordinary days. Her eyelids were a little red and swollen, and her eyes revealed a hesitant light. I wanted to ask her about the circumstances of her husband's death, but I didn't dare, because her expression, behavior, and conversation made it difficult for me to speak.</p>
<p>The next year, during the Qingming Festival, every household was busy going to the graves to sweep and pay respects. For the first time, I saw Aunt Chen also preparing tin foil and piling up what appeared to be grave goods. Unconsciously, I followed her. We stopped by a golden field, then walked into the field ridges. Finally, I discovered a coffin wrapped in straw, lying across the field near the small river. I thought this must be Chen Wenfu, Aunt Chen's husband. The fear of ghosts made me tremble. At this time, Aunt Chen put down the grass pile, lit a fire, knelt on the ground, kowtowed, and then cried sadly, crying very sadly and lingeringly.</p>
<p>"Won't ghosts appear? Aunt Chen has told me many times in stories that she must cry one out today."</p>
<p>"Ah! Ghost! I'm afraid!" I cried out loud.</p>
<p>Aunt Chen stopped crying, hugged me, and went home. My mother even performed a ritual to dispel bad luck for me, saying that I had encountered an evil spirit.</p>
<p>One summer vacation, we were cooling off on the threshing ground in front of the house. I lay on the rattan couch, biting on sorghum, and forced Aunt Chen to tell stories with my younger siblings!</p>
<p>"Once upon a time, there was a bitter woman who was married to Zhang She by her parents at the age of eighteen. Who knew that her husband was an opium addict and a gambler. She couldn't control her husband and had to sigh at her bad luck. At first, they had thirty or forty acres of their own land, and the family was still considered well-off. Later, Zhang She lost more and more in gambling, and his opium addiction also grew bigger and bigger. Slowly, he mortgaged the land, sold the furniture, and even stole clothes to pawn. At this time, there were two more mouths in the family, a son and a daughter... Finally, when he had no way out, he even demolished and sold the three-room tile house handed down from his ancestors. He became a vagrant... abandoning his bitter wife and lonely children... In desperation, the daughter became someone else's child bride, the son worked as a long-term worker for others, and his wife also went to help out in other people's homes. She was very diligent and worked non-stop, because whenever she had free time, she would think of her husband and children, and she would become extremely sad." Aunt Chen stopped here suddenly. Raising her head, I saw Aunt Chen wiping her tears with both hands. "She has a really good heart," I thought, "shedding tears for the characters in the story."</p>
<p>Once, Aunt Chen fell ill. My mother called me to visit her. By her lonely sickbed, she groaned and told me that all her joints were tight and painful because she had been beaten by Chen Wenfu and it had become a problem, which would flare up every time she was sick.</p>
<p>Later, I met her daughter, A Mei, who had escaped to my house because she couldn't bear her mother-in-law's abuse. Three days later, a stranger came to my house, claiming to be A Mei's father-in-law, and wanted to take her back. A Mei cried loudly and clung to the pillar in the hall, refusing to leave. Her father-in-law took a rope from his pocket and waved it at A Mei, threatening:</p>
<p>"Come with me! Don't make your dad angry, lest you suffer..."</p>
<p>A Mei seemed to be a born hero, stubbornly saying:</p>
<p>"No, I won't go with you. I never want to go to your house, see you... and my mother-in-law..."</p>
<p>The stranger angrily tied A Mei with the rope. Although A Mei resisted desperately, he carried her away after all. A Mei's cries and curses came from afar. At this time, Aunt Chen cried.</p>
<p>I was really surprised: the adults stared at their performance, not helping A Mei in the slightest! My mother, Aunt Zhou, and other servants.</p>
<p>Year after year, I watched Aunt Chen gradually age, and her worries became heavier and heavier. One winter vacation, when I returned home from school (middle school), my younger sister took my hand and stood under the big tree in front of the gate, pointing to the black and white walls of the building in Hedong, and told me that this was the new house built by Aunt Chen.</p>
<p>At night, I learned from my mother's conversation that Aunt Chen had spent most of her savings from more than a decade of wages, and with my mother's great help, she had built this house to prepare for her son A Bao to marry a wife because he was already in his twenties. They had already taken a fancy to Aunt Hong's maid A Dong and were asking a matchmaker to arrange it.</p>
<p>In the new year, Aunt Chen invited me to visit her new house, which was just three empty rooms. When I got home, I urged my mother to send some old furniture to her. It was regrettable that A Bao had inherited his father's legacy. Although he didn't smoke opium, he was also a gentleman who was old in the ways of gambling. I prayed silently that he would not inherit his father's mantle and destroy the hopes that his mother had worked hard for half her life.</p>
<p>After that, every time I returned home, I would hear news about A Bao's gambling, and it was easy to see that Aunt Chen's fervent concern for her son was permeated with keen anxiety. In my memory, the shadow of the frustrated Chen Wenfu often followed A Bao's name, flashing through my mind.</p>
<p>When the war swept through my hometown like a hurricane, Aunt Chen, unwilling to leave the house she had built for less than half a year, refused to join our wandering team and stayed alone to guard her hometown. When my family's house was cremated, Aunt Chen, who had lived there for nearly twenty years, served as the only coffin bearer.</p>
<p>Now I think, maybe God has changed his style and started to bless Aunt Chen, I hope so.</p>
<h3>Chinese Music in the Eyes of Foreigners The Soul of Chinese Music</h3>
<p>— H. Swidalloff</p>
<p>Even Europeans who have lived in China are rarely able to have a correct understanding of Chinese musical art. Most people establish their concepts of Chinese music based on the rumbling harmonies that drift into the street from the windows of Chinese folk theaters and the heart-rending high-pitched voices from street radio broadcasts. This leads to a contempt for Chinese music, especially among Europeans.</p>
<p>However, we do not need to marvel that modern Chinese people do not appreciate their own national music much either. Among Chinese intellectuals, you can find countless people who know and understand Tchaikovsky, Debussy, and even Bach; however, they do not have a shred of understanding of the heritage of Chinese indigenous music. Therefore, what enjoys an advantage in modern China is still very elementary, self-generating folk music – which has a large number of folk musicians (self-taught) – or European composer's music, including jazz music.</p>
<p>Just like the theater, music in China can be said to have flourished in the emperor's court and in large-scale performances by the ruling class. The ruling class supported this art for its own entertainment, keeping musicians in their residences. Musicians and actors generally lived miserable lives, which could not promote the high development of music. However, individual geniuses could gradually rise above the general level, pushing national music forward and creating unique and wonderful ways of musical thinking, many of which are related to us for very long periods of time. The Tang Dynasty – the most prosperous period of Chinese art – was already more than a thousand years ago, when European culture was still in its infancy. Unfortunately, China still does not have its own scientifically studied history of music, and therefore Chinese music does not yet have a clear path for its future development. It either wanders along the original path or abandons its own national essence, loses its true value, and blindly imitates European archetypes.</p>
<p>But now it should also be mentioned that some modern historical materials of Chinese music clearly show that some representatives of Chinese music groups have begun to become self-aware. In recent times, individuals or groups specializing in the study of Chinese classical music have gradually appeared. About six years ago, the "Chinese National Music Research Association" was initiated in Shanghai. Its leader is Mr. Sun Yude, China's best Xiao (vertical bamboo flute) player and Pipa (Chinese lute) master. The purpose of the association is to study ancient classical music, enrich its orchestral pieces, bring it up to the level of modern musical art, and make national music more and more popular among the general public.</p>
<p>A few days ago, the Chinese National Music Association held its fifth public performance of Chinese classical music at the Lyceum Theatre in this city. The performance program was arranged very successfully, with orchestral pieces, music solos, sword dance, and vocal performances all interspersed appropriately!</p>
<p>This made the European prejudice against Chinese music disappear very quickly. All ears were chasing after the first harmonic sound of the orchestra from the very beginning. This group consists of ten people. In the string section, there is the Pipa, a Chinese rural instrument – which is reminiscent of our "guitar" in sound. The huge seven-stringed Pipa occupies a position of honor. A Xiao (bamboo flute) four Huqins (folk two-stringed fiddles "Erhu") – these instruments distantly remind people of our "balalaika" (lacking its high-pitched sound) – a big drum and other percussion instruments.</p>
<p>Among the many ensembles, the best was "Pan Lun Pao." As is generally thought, this was written by the famous poet Wang Wei of the Tang Dynasty. It describes the life of a heroic King Xiang Yu, a hero who lived in the third century BC. The melody of the music vividly conveys King Xiang's battles and vicissitudes, as well as his tragic defeat, his death, and his tearful farewell to his beloved concubine!</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Qide showed excellent artistic skill in playing the Pipa. He played "Huaiyin Ping Chu," a famous piece from the Song Dynasty, which also has a heroic theme. In the hands of the musician, the Pipa inserted countless variations into the sound melody.</p>
<p>It was very satisfying to listen to Miss Shen Shuhuan's solo, controlling her beautiful and powerful voice. Accompanied by the Huqin, she spiritedly sang "Autumn Thoughts," depicting the sad mood of an aging woman who has lost her beauty and youth.</p>
<p>It was very interesting to watch Mr. Ye Dazhang and Miss Pu Yu's collaborative "Sword Dance." The performance of this sword dance program seemed to be close to European dance art. However, combined with its own unique style, the eyes and footwork are all uniquely wonderful!</p>
<p>Chinese music has a unique melancholy and meditation, or the noise of war. These characteristics reflect the centuries of Chinese national history, which has struggled through endless civil wars and foreign troubles. These characteristics are also present in the tragedies of all ensembles.</p>
<p>It is difficult to say whether this ensemble music reflects the true soul of Chinese music, but one thing can be believed with certainty: a certain part of this complex soul has been imprisoned.

<h3>Notes on a Chinese Classical Music Concert</h3>
<p>— L. Arnotov</p>
<p>A Chinese classical music concert hosted by the "Chinese Music Research Association" was held at the Lyceum Theatre on June 28th and 29th.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, this performance by the National Music Research Association has moved the Chinese musical audience to pay close attention to what is displayed in front of them and to discover the priceless treasures of ancient melodies on these old instruments.</p>
<p>The president of the National Music Research Association and conductor of the orchestra is Mr. Sun Yude. For fifteen years, Mr. Sun has devoted himself to the revival of classical music, the ancient music that Confucius would use to teach his disciples. Mr. Sun is skilled in the Pipa and is also a famous Xiao player. Special mention should also be made of Mr. Han Zhenhan, the secretary-general of the association, who, in his spare time, has studied the violin with members of the Shanghai Municipal Council Symphony Orchestra. He is a player of the classical melodies of "Erhu" and "Drums." Mr. Han Zhenjia, the younger brother of Mr. Han Zhenhan, also showed his skills in Erhu, cymbals, and Suona in this performance. Others such as Mr. Cao Xuzhen's Erhu, Mr. Zhu Wenyi's Zither and Yangqin, and Mr. Chen's Dongxiao were all excellent.</p>
<p>Among the performers, Miss Shen Shuhuan's solo and Mr. Ye Dazhang and Miss Pu Yu's skilled sword dance added to the expression of the unique temperament of Chinese classical music.</p>
<p>In short, this concert gave everyone a deep and unforgettable impression, especially for those who want to know the secrets of Chinese classical music.</p>
<p>In tense listening, we did not regret spending two hours in the colorful and personalized melodies played on ancient instruments. (Translated by Ge Ruo Nian from the Russian Chira Daily, July 2, the author is the editor-in-chief of the newspaper.)</p>

<h3>Volleyball League Has Begun Progress in Skills Should Be Sought Performances of the Yuhua Green Team Were Quite Remarkable</h3>
<p>— Mei Jie</p>
<p>The 33rd Annual Volleyball League kicked off last weekend at the Chinese Gymnasium, with matches every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday. The entire schedule is expected to conclude by the middle of August. After watching the Grade A men's and women's matches, this reporter feels that the standard of this year's league is even worse than in the past. Is it due to a lack of guidance or a lack of training among the players? Here, I sincerely hope that the situation at the beginning of the league will improve later on to please the audience. The reviews of the two matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Last Sunday (the 9th) was the opening match. The first match was in the women's division, with the strong Chinese team, the Three Provinces Team, facing the mediocre Lianhe women's team. The Three Provinces Team has strong strength, and victory was within their grasp. Unfortunately, the Soviet team unexpectedly retreated without a fight and deserted. As a result, the Three Provinces women's team had no opponent and won without effort, which was truly disappointing.</p>
<h3>Yuhua Was Not Outstanding, China Film Was Even More Depressed</h3>
<p>Another match was in the Grade A division, with Yuhua playing China Film. Both teams are outstanding among the Chinese teams. This match was no different from resolving a clash between Chinese giants. Therefore, both sides were scheming and fighting for victory. In the end, Yuhua, with its average talent, defeated China Film three to one, but it was indeed a strenuous effort. Looking at the performances of both sides, although the situation was tight, the results were difficult to satisfy. The attack was weak, and the defense was lax. Guo Bingkun's smash of Yuhua was indeed fierce. However, it rarely succeeded in the match and often went out of bounds. China Film only relied on Tan Yonggang and Li Shizhong to maintain the team. The rest of the players were mostly mediocre. Therefore, they had to suffer a crushing defeat. Yuhua's victory was indeed deserved. However, the performance was disappointing. If they encounter the Russian Emigrant First and Second Teams in the Soviet League in the future, things will be more ominous than auspicious if they continue like this. I wonder what team leader Xiao Xigeng will use to train his soldiers to repel the "Huns" and compete for the championship?</p>
<p>On Wednesday (the 12th) of this week, there was also one match each in the women's and Grade A divisions, both between Chinese and Western teams. As a result, the Chinese team won in the women's division, while the foreign team won in the Grade A division.</p>
<h3>The Green Team Displayed Its Might for the First Time Overwhelming the Western Youth Champion</h3>
<p>The first match was between the Yuan team and the Western Youth Red women's teams. The Western Youth Red is the championship team in the Western Youth League, having defeated strong Chinese teams such as Hua Peng and Three Provinces in the Western Youth League. Their strength is indeed considered strong. The Green Team was composed of basic members of the basketball team, plus two famous volleyball players, Huang Fufen and Xiang Yulin. At the beginning of their organization, many expected that they would not achieve good results. Most people thought that the Green Team would definitely lose before this match, because two of the Green Team's main players were sick. Unexpectedly, as soon as they made contact, the Green Team was full of momentum. Wang Yinlan's spike, Wang Weizhen's rescue, Huang Mingyuan's smash, and Yan Wei, Rong Shujian, and Xiang Yulin's serves were abnormally magical, causing the foreign women to be stunned and unable to resist. They washed away the female power in the Western Youth volleyball court and lost two games in a row. The Green Team won easily. The Green Team is new to volleyball, and this achievement is not easy. It is also gratifying that they vented their anger for the Chinese women. It is hoped that the Green Team women will continue their good work, so that their volleyball fame will not be difficult to match the basketball team's.</p>
<h3>The White Team Should Have Won But Didn't The Russian B Team Could Avoid Strict Discipline</h3>
<p>Next was the Grade A match between the White Team and the Russian Emigrant B Team. The latter is the weakest among the foreign teams. With the White Team's qualifications and experience, it should not be difficult to capture them in one go. After losing the first game, the White Team was determined to make progress and won the second and third games. They also had the upper hand in the fourth game, leading twenty to seventeen. Victory was already within their grasp. Who knew that they would lose Jingzhou through carelessness, losing five points and allowing the Russian Emigrants to tie the score at two games each. In the last game, the White Team tried to recover, but they were unable to do so, and they suffered a tragic defeat by a score of twenty-four to twenty-six after several ties. It was truly unfortunate. As a result, the Russian Emigrant B Team won three to two. The White Team's talent and skills are indeed better than those of the Russian B Team. Their failure was only due to their momentary carelessness in the fourth game. From this, it can be seen that to win a volleyball match, no matter what the situation, you cannot relax even one step. The White Team's failure also taught them a lesson.</p>
<h3>Reflections on Emerging Stars of the Football and Basketball Season</h3>
<p>— Bi Xian</p>
<p>This year's football and basketball season has swiftly passed, and all the wonderful performances have become a page in the history of sports. However, sports activities in Shanghai are still thriving. Only a small-scale football (soccer) is being used to provide players with opportunities to stretch their muscles, so as to maintain their skills and achieve further progress in preparation for the next season. Taking advantage of this respite, I will review the emerging stars of this year's football and basketball season and record their achievements, to encourage them to work even harder and to inspire the efforts of those who come after them.</p>
<h3>Emerging Football Talents: Two Stars Rise to Fame</h3>
<p>Most football teams this season had many veteran players. Even among the newcomers, most were still somewhat lacking due to experience. However, the following two players are, in my opinion, outstanding among the newcomers and have indeed risen to fame.</p>
<p>Left Winger Li Yao</p>
<p>At the beginning of the season, Li Yao was appointed as the left winger for the Tung Wah team. His name was unfamiliar, and people expected him to achieve nothing. Indeed, in the initial matches, not only was his skill lacking, but he was also exceptionally nervous on the field. However, Mr. Li was very eager to improve and also received guidance from Sun Xishun. Therefore, he made significant progress in each match. By the end of the season, he had become truly impressive. His dribbling and hooking could be described as extremely skillful. Compared to Cao Qiuting, who was famous in Shanghai before, he was not much inferior. What is particularly commendable is that he could also use opportunities to shoot at goal from the wing, and his shooting was indeed successful. Li Yao has only had one season of competing against strong opponents and has already made such progress. His future prospects are immeasurable. I deeply hope that he will not be complacent, but continue to work hard with an open mind. Then his future achievements will be beyond what anyone can predict. Keep striving!</p>
<p>Forward Li Hua, the "Face Saver"</p>
<p>In the "Foreign" (one stroke) team, the names of the Yu brothers were initially unnoticed. Moreover, Li Hua was young and had little experience on the field, so he was not paid much attention to as a newcomer. However, in the match between Tung Wah and a police team, Li Hua took on a challenging role, tasked with guarding You Liang. Young Yu carefully responded and fought bravely. Although he didn't achieve any great success, he certainly restrained You Liang, thus attracting attention. As a result, he was selected as a representative of China and the Chinese League. Although he was on the list, he was not given important tasks by the authorities, so he had few opportunities to show his skills. Therefore, he never gained the trust of the public. However, in the last match, the Chinese League played against the Portuguese League at the Recreation Ground. That day, the Chinese League team was incomplete. In the first half, among the Tung Wah players, there was only Yu Li Hua. Before the match, after some guidance from Li Ning, it was as if a lock had been opened, and Li Hua performed flawlessly, completely stifling Fu En, who was dominant at the time. He also had good communication with the Tung Wah players, so it was difficult to distinguish him as belonging to two different teams. This initial cooperation showed that Li Hua is young and full of potential. If he can get guidance from veteran players, his achievements will not be limited to his current situation.</p>
<h3>Rising Basketball Stars: Only Two Worth Mentioning</h3>
<p>In this year's basketball teams, there were many veteran players and also quite a few rising stars. Unfortunately, very few of them achieved success. Only the Chinese League and Ren Yu (Wei Ting) can be mentioned.</p>
<p>Center Wu Chengchang</p>
<p>Mr. Wu's nickname is "Ah Di," which shows his youth. He is highly appreciated by Zhang Hongxiang, the leader of the Chinese League team. Therefore, he played as a regular player from the beginning of the season. Mr. Zhang guided him carefully, believing that he was facing strong opponents for the first time, providing enlightenment in all aspects before and after the games. Ah Di listened and followed the instructions, so his skills improved day by day. Moreover, he was naturally well-proportioned and had good jumping ability, which complemented each other perfectly. By the end of the season, Ah Di's skills as a center were no worse than those of ordinary veteran players, and he became an indispensable member of the Chinese League team. His rapid progress is admirable. Moreover, Ah Di is not arrogant at all. It is expected that in the next season, Wu Chengchang will become even more famous in the basketball world.</p>
<p>Left Forward Lin Weicong</p>
<p>Xiao Lin is the left forward of the Ren Yu team. Since the Ren Yu team was established, they have felt a lack of forwards. At that time, Xiao Lin was still playing in a second-tier team. He was recruited by Xu of Ren Yu. Because he was very eager to improve, he was given a difficult task. However, there was talk of "No great generals in Shu, Liao Hua serves as a vanguard." But as the saying goes, "Where there's a will, there's a way." Xiao Lin worked hard to live up to the responsibility. He improved day by day. In the match between Ren Yu and Zhong Bei, Xiao Lin was energetic and scored the most points, making the opposing defenders suffer greatly. He became a well-known forward in the basketball world. Xiao Lin is still studying and has a good environment. His fame is just around the corner.</p>
<p>Note: The writer of this article has absolutely no intention of flattery. The reporter does not know the above four athletes at all. Writing this is merely to encourage those who come after them.</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>The Youth Friendship Association's stadium has a beautiful environment and complete facilities. It has two volleyball courts, two basketball courts, and one small football field (which can also be used as a tennis court or a croquet court). Each court is surrounded by dense trees, suitable for spectators to stand and watch, making it a good place to play and watch sports. According to Mr. Peng, the president of the association, he is very willing to introduce it to the Shanghai sports community and welcomes rentals. This is good news for sports teams.</p>
<p>This year's football, basketball, and volleyball talents include Zhang Xianlun (football for the Wah Tung team, basketball for the Chinese League team, volleyball for the White team) and Li Zhenzhong (basketball for the Zhong Bei team, volleyball for the Wah Ying team, small football for the Zhong Chu team), etc. There are also foreigners such as Founik and Ivanov, etc. There are countless talents in both basketball and volleyball.</p>
<p>In recent years, sports activities have been booming. For example, this year's small football competition had as many as 180 teams, which is a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>In women's volleyball, veteran players who have played for more than ten years are still showing their prowess. For example, Huang Xingfen of the Green team is still the pillar of the team. Li Bo of the Three Provinces has many children but remains energetic, showing that middle-aged women are not inferior to young women. This makes one feel the difficulty of finding talents and the scarcity of those who come after them.</p>
