<h3 id="c1">捐助遊民勞動營 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今年三月閱，市政當局　設警察消費合作社，上月間，社會福利部與市政府　設上海遊民勞動營，關於這兩件事，我們均曾　次表示意見，並向社會人士呼籲襄助。一</p>
<p>從維護上海治安的觀點而言，第一，必須積極的加強警察的服務效能。改善警察待遇，足以提高警察廉務效率；警察消費合作社，足以局部改善警察待遇。所以，組織驚察消費合作社，是維護上海治安的積極方法之一。第一，必須消極的減少無業流民的遊手好閱。校容移墾無業流民，足以淸滅竊劫詐欺案件，遊民勞動營，足以集中管發無業流民，所以，設立遊民勞動營，是維護上海治安的消極方法之一</p>
<p>從社會公益以至慈善惻際的觀點而言，無業流民中包括老弱婦孺，鳩形鵠面，孑然　零，餐實宿露，執無父母，誰無子女，推己及人，昔有惻隱之心。則政府既已倡導收容於上，社會自當贊助於下。所以，設立遊民勞動營，是社會公益事業，社會各界自有共同協助之義務，出錢出力，早觀厥丞成。</p>
<p>更從市容觀　而言，遊民乞丐，流浪兒童，充塞　頭，沿途求乞，穿梭人　，行人道上，席　而臥，對於市容觀瞻，既不整肅，對於情潔衛生，復多空礙，更有收容集中之必要。</p>
<p>遊民勞動之目的，收容上海遊民乞丐，流氓地痞，施以感化教育及強制農村勞動，以期協助生產，整肅市容，改善治安，但事實上上海遊民乞丐數量之多，一時悉數收容，勢有困難，只能視環境與經濟力量，分期實施，在當局通盤籌畫之下，規定漸進步驟，次第實現，亦非難事。</p>
<p>據最近消息，上海遊民勞動營正在積極籌備。惟因開辦經費即需動用，前次當局召集各界談話會席間，會決定籌募目標為二千萬元，尚待各界踴躍輸捐，一方面分請本市各業公會向會員勸募。我們於此項向各業公會及會員諸君進言者，關於遊民勞助營設立意義及其重要性，已經當局闡釋。我們在上面也略為申述，無論為維護治安，協助公益，整　市容，均有共同促成之義務，況且，就遊民勞動營規定標準，分為甲乙丙三等，甲等二千元，一等一千五百元，丙等五百元，勸　數目，很為允當，顧到工商界一般的經濟能利，足以負擔。深盼各業公會婉為勸說，各業會員慷慨捐助，俾如期　成整數，使該　得以按照預定計劃，早日成立。</p>
<p>最後，我們以這樣至誠，希望盟邦日本工商男人士共同捐助，我們相信盟邦人士目一　上海流民之充塞，對於大航海遊民勞動營的收容管教，必能贊同，必能概助。</p>

<p>各方面日軍一周戰況</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電據此問軍事家說明末週間各地之戰況如次：</p>
<p>中太平洋方面，本周來敵軍之動向殊堪重視，敵於十日以有力激動部隊馳赴馬利安納島方海面，隨即於是日下午至十三日上午分別對塞班·迭尼安等加以轟炸，十三日則更有敵砲艦射繫，當地日軍駐屯部隊對來襲上述各敵之敵機加以邀擊後，即擊落其一百二十一架，擊毀其三架，並擊沉其軍艦一艘。但自十五日晨敵軍仍企圖在砲艦之掩證下，在塞班烏登陸，當時日軍部隊曾在水際二度將之擊退，但敵軍於兩度被擊退後，登陸企圖仍未稍煞，乃再作第三次之登陸，目下仍激戰中。十五日下午敵機動部隊曾空襲小笠原羣島之硫磺島，但經日軍邀擊後，即擊落其十七架，其餘敵機均被擊退，是役日方損害極其輕徼。</p>
<p>南太平洋　方面，關於新幾內亞特爾河河口附近之戰鬥，自六月五日以來，敵軍又不斷在該方面逐次增援，刻日軍對此等敵軍正予以猛擊而展開激戰。戳至十一日止，因日軍之攻擊，敵軍遺屍達一千三百餘具，大砲被毀者計入鬥以上。在必阿克方面敵軍，其後雖屢張重創，但刻仍繼續增援，日軍對其增援部隊連日作猛烈之夜襲，屢次粉碎敵擴張據點之企圖。北外，日機隊並曾於十二日上午在必阿克島附近海面，圍攻敵艦隊，絡果擊　其巡洋艦二艘，是役日機未歸還者亦有五架。十一日及十三日拂曉，日機亦會轟炸必阿克島之敵陣，使敵障六處發生大火，島上敵陣亦因十三日間日有機之轟炸，而五處起火焚燒。入日日機在蘇州附近海上，會與敵B24型機十餘架P38型機三十架交戰，結果擊落其P38型機一一架。敵機亦曾來襲巴波馬諾加利　但經日機邀擊後，即被擊落B25型機四架及其他型于數架。所羅門方面來製拉巴爾方面之敵機，本月七日至十三日止，計共六十四以上，（其中經日機擊落者計九架）來襲波根維爾鳥南端之敵機，由入日起至十一止四日間果計一百入十一架以上，（其中被擊落者計入架）。此外在該期間內，來製布加地區之敵機計有入十二架之多。</p>
<p>北太平洋方面，敵之行動亦逐漸活躍，大月上旬敵機共計三架來襲，十三日夜又一度來犯，十四日一敵更利用濃霧，以相當有力艦隊逼近北千島攻擊該方面陸上陣地，日軍現仍巖重戒備中。</p>
<p>緬甸方面（陸上作戰）哥希馬方面，敵為打通伊　　血路起見，不斷出動大兵力猛攻日軍陣地，日軍則將敵軍擊潰，　加強守備，自十日以來，巴列　方面敵軍已感動搖，日軍刻正壓縮巴列爾前方之敵軍，更猛攻比先波爾方面。又怒江方面日軍對渡河前來之敵軍。到處展開　滅戰自五月十日至大月十日渝軍棄　已遠二四〇具。（空軍作戰）雖巳入梅雨季節，但日空軍仍甚活躍，留惡劣天氣協力陸上作戰。</p>
<p>中國大陸路方面「河南戰綫」日軍察覺敵人反攻動向時遂即出動，予靈實西南地區渝軍以重大打擎，第一戰區自不待　，第入區兩集團軍共計十六師亦被擊潰。「湖南戰綫」　攻粵漢綫東方之日軍部隊，於長沙五十四公里之　陽河附近，擊潰死守該　之敵軍，繼之更渡過瀏　河南進，一方由粵漢綫　方進攻之日軍，亦於盆陽前方擊漬敵九十九軍，刻正四週圍攻長沙，作戰　順利。（空軍作戰）日　協力陸上部隊作戰，收穫極天戰果，六月上句，敵軍侵獲達九十七次，出動飛機五百三十入架，其中為日軍擊落擊毀入十八架。十一日晨進攻遂川，炸毀渝機三十五架。十一日強襲恩施梅山，共擎毀　機十二架。</p>
<h3 id="c5">從松江到上海 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>米糧新描　所招致的上海空前的高米價，影響呢？記者在出發松江以前，先從調查機關的懇切指示而獲得了預備知識。但百聞不如一見，及至　履松江之土，見聞種種現象以後，才得到深對的衝擊。以下所述，沒有理論，也沒有批評，祗得所見所關的實情實感報告出來，以供讀者參攷，同時希望施策當局確立即應實情的萬全的方針。</p>
<p>從米臂佳良聞各的松江向渴望米　　人的上海搬運米糧的路綫，可大別為三絛，第一是鐵路，第二是道路，第三是水路。記者對於由這路水路搬運的狀況雖然索能視察，但由鐵路機運的情形則能充分看到。據某機關首腦者對記者說，五月中搬出的米糧，其推定量達十萬石之巨，處想到松江全縣產米入十萬石這一點，則其數之　　可思過牛了。據說在十萬石中，由鐵路攤運者佔三萬石，又攤某人說：「因事邊某鎮時。向米店資爾升米，不料米店已將來完全賣給上海來貿的人，經再三態談以後，結果將他們自家用的米分了兩升。以這種難以想像的速度，人擁到松江，米流人了上海。」然而松江縣的米不會從地裹涌出來，受到上海米價貴的刺戟而無限制流出後，松江縣本身的民食問題自無不深刻化的道理。果然，在六月二日的翌日（六月二日上海的米價實達〇〇元，從而松江的米價也漲到〇〇元），縣政府召開各機關緊急連絡會議，敵實　　之後，　有禁止米糧出境，公布協定米價之舉。由於這種措買，自三日以降約三四天內，松江米糧市塲乃有市價不定交易停滯的狀態。</p>
<p>實行上述自衛手段的，似不止松江一縣，於是入日實業部發表命令地方政府撤回「不法移動限制」之旨。關於這個問題，松江的人士說：</p>
<p>「米的對策不應僅由上海的見地樹立。那樣的施策是藏頭露尾的拙策。無論是怎樣的產米區，米量自有限界。如取不問皂白統統搬往上海的方針，在上海或許是好的也未可知，但在產地松江可沒有再比這個為難的事了。如果上海的米價因而大見安定，倒也甘心，但運去的米成為投搬囤積的對　，雖有投機性的一騰一落，卻一點沒見好轉。這樣，產米區的忍辛耐苦不試一塲空嗎？松江的米價暴騰以後，本年度的收買又如何呢？我們這次講求緊急日衝手段，並非另有用意，祇是為了松江民生而不得已採取的措置。而且依然視此項措置如無物而有相當盡量的米糧搬出。」</p>
<p>此種措置和見解是否合理，且待議者及當局者判斷，但在上海聲明廢止移動限止時，松江卻聲明限制移動；在上海米價至少在目前是任其「自然之勢」時，松江部發表協定的市價：且在上海配給停頓之時，松江卻可說芷在實行初步的配給，由縣政府採取憑縣民證購買定量食米的保護政策，這些在由實業部所發臨時指令加以解決上，實為重大的現實。這樣的現象在松江以外各地區也有吧，雖然形態不同。然則盼望各府直視各地區的新事態，向確立不致惹起上海與各地區間的矛盾和對立通　對策之途邁進，當非記者　　人吧。</p>
<p>米糧列車</p>
<p>六月三日以降，為販米到上海而殺到松江站的單帮，人數大減。此可謂是松江縣政府採取新措置的結果。但從入日起，似有逐漸增加的衛兆。六日三。頃，一列革約一千二百名，四列車約四千入百名的人，帶了二斗三斗甚至一石以上的米，每日往來於上海松江之問。平常據說每天亦不下二千名左右，他們在松江以外，並到嘉善　　及其他各站，合頂總有一萬名以上的單帮為了搜買米糧而出動於滬杭沿機。滬杭綫的列車簡直變為米糧列車單帮列車了松江米　情形調查竣事以後，記者在火車站中等待末班火車來到取單帮大軍殺到後所起的混雜，呌喊，無秩序的情形。站員們說：</p>
<p>「總有上千人的大羣從四面入方爭向列車前進。要將他們整理一下，簡直是不可能的，他們大多數並不經由軋粟處而登車，如伙兵一　在車站四周待機，一待火車到站，便一齊爭先尖近，有些從三等車的窗口將米和身體往車內亂塞，有些越境侵入二等車，有些　登車頂。總而言之，凡是可以防米和立身的一切場所。都被他們完全佔領利用，無票乘　或　了　未會　過的人，非常之多。在松江站柵　之內，於綫路之外掘有壕滿，那邊有人專門將米和人邊過　溝，生意非常之好。這些事情，使我們身心俱痰，幸而最近稍殺，但八日以後又開始漸漸增長，是昨日吧，有人因要趕著　登已經開動的火　而受到了致命傷。」</p>
<p>單憑這席話便不難想像實際的情形是如何的離亂，由上海開抵松江的列事項上，至少有三四十人坐着，記者目覩這種情形，不覺想起了日本大地震時的光景。由此亦可察知最盛期的混亂樣子，在單幫之中，既有早已幹著這行生意的老單幫，而巡捕，公務員，　笑婦等等偶一為之的單量乃至臨時單幫，人數也非常多。彈門蜂擁到松江的米店前，爭先恐後將米店的米搜購一空。這樣的狀態，無論怎樣想，總不能說是正常的物資移動。撤廢米糧移動限制的用意，是在消滅私運現象吧。然「私運」現象竟如此旺盛。這果眞是過　現象嗎？欲使這種情形　為過渡現象，非剷除決戰下畸形商業行為繁榮的禍根不可。着不如此，這現象縱然　滅，亦將現出變形而更深刻的新現象吧。記者一面站員對談，一面不得不痛切感到米糧問題的確是易說難行。（竹本特派員通訊：　自六月十一日大新陸）</p>

<p>柏林十入日中央社電據前綫消息：反軸心軍在艦砲射擊這　下，復於柯坦汀地區以新銳部隊登陸。</p>
<p>侵歐兵力約三十師</p>
<p>柏林十人日中央社</p>
<p>電德國新聞社訊：在過去二十四小時中，侵歐戰綫之戰國並無消息，從俘盧及機利品之數目上觀之，可推定反軸心軍在諾曼第者至少有三十師，上述數目尚未包括工兵重砲兵及其他特殊部隊。　高茂萊將軍所部，現時已大部在侵歐戰綫中作戰，但　高茂萊將軍已無法再作大規模之攻勢，蓋所餘　可調遺之五師至入師之軍力，須用以補充現在奧納河西岸及聖瑪利地區作戰之英美軍也。</p>
<p>損失浩大未達目標</p>
<p>現司推定艾森軍所指揮之部隊，已有百分之四十被牽掣，最重要者為濛高茂　將軍既已使用如此大量之軍隊，乃不能達到其所被指派之作戰目標，至現在為止，渠尚不能截斷柯坦汀半烏而佔領重要海港瑟堡。反軸心軍於十六日佔領聖維　特（St.Vicomte）雖有助於截斷柯坦汀半島，但征服諾曼第則尚未實現，因此艾森霍華將軍在未完成其第一項任務之前，是否特發動其攻歐之第二階段，尚成疑問。目前尚有大量海軍及運輸艦與登陸舟艇被牽擊於塞納瀝方面，艾森　華將軍或將俟佔領柯坦江及縣堡之後，再行發動作戰。</p>
<p>準備發動二期作戰</p>
<p>但亦或將因　　　會議所定之時刻業已到期，而不得不於第一期載事尚未結束，即行發動第二期作戰。艾氏在此次作戰中所可　軍之軍隊估計約有五十師至六十師，其中有空論部隊四師，此項大軍待命於英國南岸及倫敦及倫敦與恒勃河口間至地區，於此可見第二次登陸將在何處實行，大致艾氏將使用此項部隊之大部份，以企圖佔領澳斯坦（Ostend）得與鄧扣克問之海岸而向東北及西南方面進攻。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Donating to the Vagrant Labor Camp <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In March of this year, the municipal authorities established a police consumer cooperative. Last month, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government established the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. We have repeatedly expressed our opinions on these two matters and appealed to the public for assistance.</p>
<p>From the perspective of maintaining public order in Shanghai, first, we must actively strengthen the service effectiveness of the police. Improving police treatment is sufficient to enhance police integrity and efficiency; a police consumer cooperative is sufficient to partially improve police treatment. Therefore, organizing a police consumer cooperative is one of the proactive methods of maintaining public order in Shanghai. Secondly, we must passively reduce the idleness of unemployed vagrants. Relocating and reclaiming land for unemployed vagrants is sufficient to eliminate theft, robbery, and fraud cases. A vagrant labor camp is sufficient to centrally manage and deploy unemployed vagrants. Therefore, establishing a vagrant labor camp is one of the passive methods of maintaining public order in Shanghai.</p>
<p>From the perspective of social welfare and even charitable compassion, unemployed vagrants include the elderly, the weak, women, and children, emaciated and alone, exposed to the elements, without parents or children. Considering others as oneself, one should have compassion. Since the government has advocated for their accommodation, society should naturally support it. Therefore, establishing a vagrant labor camp is a social welfare undertaking, and all sectors of society have a shared obligation to assist, contributing money and effort to witness its early success.</p>
<p>Furthermore, from the perspective of urban appearance, vagrants and beggars, wandering children, fill the streets, begging along the way, weaving through crowds, and sleeping on sidewalks. This is not only unsightly but also detrimental to cleanliness and hygiene, necessitating their accommodation and concentration.</p>
<p>The purpose of the vagrant labor camp is to accommodate vagrants, beggars, and local bullies in Shanghai, providing them with moral education and compulsory agricultural labor, with the aim of assisting production, tidying up the city appearance, and improving public order. However, in reality, the number of vagrants and beggars in Shanghai is so large that it is difficult to accommodate them all at once. It can only be implemented in phases, depending on the environment and economic strength. Under the overall planning of the authorities, stipulating gradual steps and realizing them in order is not a difficult task.</p>
<p>According to recent news, the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp is actively preparing. However, since start-up funding is needed immediately, the authorities convened a symposium with representatives from all sectors, where it was decided to raise a target of 20 million yuan, pending enthusiastic donations from all sectors. On the one hand, the various trade associations in the city were requested to solicit donations from their members. To the trade associations and their members, we would like to say that the authorities have already explained the significance and importance of establishing the vagrant labor camp. We have also briefly stated above that, whether for maintaining public order, assisting public welfare, or tidying up the city appearance, we all have a shared obligation to promote it. Moreover, the vagrant labor camp stipulates standards divided into three grades: Grade A at 2,000 yuan, Grade B at 1,500 yuan, and Grade C at 500 yuan. The suggested donation amounts are very appropriate, considering the general economic capacity of the industrial and commercial sectors, which is sufficient to bear the burden. We deeply hope that the various trade associations will gently persuade their members to generously donate, so that the total amount can be raised as scheduled, allowing the camp to be established as soon as possible according to the planned schedule.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely hope that the Allied Japanese business community will also jointly donate. We believe that Allied members, witnessing the proliferation of vagrants in Shanghai, will surely approve of the accommodation, management, and education of the vagrant labor camp and will certainly provide general assistance.</p>

<p>Weekly Battle Situation of Japanese Army in Various Areas</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th -- According to military experts, the battle situation in various areas during the past week is as follows:</p>
<p>In the Central Pacific, enemy activity this week is particularly noteworthy. On the 10th, the enemy sent a powerful mobile force to the sea off the Mariana Islands, and then bombed Saipan, Tinian, and other places from the afternoon of the 10th to the morning of the 13th. On the 13th, enemy warships also shelled the area. After the Japanese army garrisoned there engaged the attacking enemy aircraft, they shot down 121, destroyed 3, and sank 1 warship. However, since the morning of the 15th, the enemy has still attempted to land on Saipan under the cover of warships. The Japanese army units repelled them twice at the water's edge. However, after being repelled twice, the enemy's landing attempt did not diminish, and they made a third landing. Fierce fighting is currently underway. On the afternoon of the 15th, an enemy mobile force raided Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands, but after being engaged by the Japanese army, 17 aircraft were shot down, and the remaining enemy aircraft were repelled. Japanese losses in this battle were extremely light.</p>
<p>In the South Pacific, regarding the battle near the mouth of the Tor River in New Guinea, since June 5th, the enemy has been continuously reinforcing that area. The Japanese army is fiercely attacking these enemy forces. As of the 11th, the enemy had left behind more than 1,300 corpses due to the Japanese army's attacks, and more than a dozen artillery pieces were destroyed. On Biak Island, although the enemy has repeatedly suffered heavy losses, they are still continuing to reinforce their forces. The Japanese army has been launching fierce night attacks on their reinforcements day after day, repeatedly thwarting the enemy's attempts to expand their base. Furthermore, on the morning of the 12th, Japanese aircraft squadrons encircled and attacked the enemy fleet off Biak Island, sinking two cruisers as a result. Five Japanese aircraft were lost in this battle. On the dawn of the 11th and 13th, Japanese aircraft also bombed enemy positions on Biak Island, causing six fires in enemy obstacles. Enemy positions on the island also caught fire in five places due to bombing by Japanese aircraft on the 13th. On the 12th, Japanese aircraft encountered more than ten B24-type aircraft and thirty P38-type aircraft near Suzhou at sea, resulting in the shooting down of eleven P38-type aircraft. Enemy aircraft also raided Babo Mano Kagari, but after being engaged by Japanese aircraft, four B25-type aircraft and several other types of aircraft were shot down. From the 7th to the 13th of this month, a total of 64 or more enemy aircraft came to Rabaul from the Solomon Islands (of which 9 were shot down by Japanese aircraft). From the 8th to the 11th, a total of 181 or more enemy aircraft came to the southern tip of Bougainville Island (of which 18 were shot down). In addition, during that period, as many as 82 enemy aircraft came to the Buka area.</p>
<p>In the North Pacific, enemy activity is also gradually becoming more active. In early June, a total of three enemy aircraft raided the area. They raided again on the night of the 13th. On the 14th, the enemy, taking advantage of the dense fog, approached the Northern Kuril Islands with a considerable fleet and attacked land positions in that area. The Japanese army is currently on high alert.</p>
<p>In the Burma area (land operations), in the Kohima area, the enemy has been launching fierce attacks on Japanese army positions with large forces in order to open up the Imphal route. The Japanese army has been repelling the enemy and strengthening its defenses. Since the 10th, the enemy army in the Palel area has been showing signs of wavering. The Japanese army is currently compressing the enemy army in front of Palel and launching fierce attacks on the Bishnupur area. In addition, the Japanese army on the Nu River is launching annihilation battles against the enemy army that has crossed the river. From May 10th to June 10th, the Chongqing army abandoned a total of 240 artillery pieces. (Air operations) Although the rainy season has begun, the Japanese Air Force is still very active, assisting land operations despite the adverse weather.</p>
<p>In the China mainland area, on the "Henan front," when the Japanese army detected enemy counterattack movements, they immediately launched an attack, inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing army in the southwest area of Lingbao. The First War Area and the two group armies of the Fifth War Area, totaling sixteen divisions, were defeated. On the "Hunan front," the Japanese army units attacking eastward along the Yuehan Line defeated the enemy forces defending the area near Xianyang River, 54 kilometers from Changsha. Subsequently, they crossed the Liuyang River and advanced south. On the other hand, the Japanese army, attacking from the north along the Yuehan Line, also defeated the enemy's 99th Army in front of Panyang. They are currently encircling Changsha on all sides, and the operation is progressing smoothly. (Air operations) The Japanese Air Force is cooperating with the land forces in operations and achieving great results. In early June, the enemy conducted 97 intrusions, deploying 538 aircraft, of which 78 were shot down or destroyed by the Japanese army. On the morning of the 11th, they attacked Suichuan, destroying 35 Chongqing aircraft. On the 11th, they raided Enshi Meishan, destroying 12 aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e5">From Songjiang to Shanghai <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>What impact did the new rice control regulations have on Shanghai's unprecedentedly high rice prices? Before departing for Songjiang, I obtained preliminary knowledge from the earnest instructions of the survey agency. However, seeing is believing, and after actually setting foot on the soil of Songjiang and witnessing various phenomena, I was deeply shocked. What follows is a report of the actual situation and feelings I saw and heard, without theory or criticism, for the readers' reference, and at the same time, I hope that the policymakers will promptly formulate comprehensive policies that respond to the actual situation.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the excellent rice production area of Songjiang, the routes for transporting rice to rice-starved Shanghai can be roughly divided into three: first, the railway; second, the road; and third, the waterway. Although I was unable to inspect the waterway transport situation, I was able to fully see the situation of railway transport. According to a head of a certain agency, the estimated amount of rice transported out in May reached as high as 100,000 shi. Considering that Songjiang County only produces 80,000 shi of rice in total, the enormity of the amount is self-evident. It is said that of the 100,000 shi, 30,000 shi were transported by railway. Someone also said, "When I went to a rice store in a certain town for business, I wanted to buy some rice, but unexpectedly, the rice store had already sold all of its rice to merchants from Shanghai. After repeated pleading, they finally sold me two sheng of rice from their own supply. At this unimaginable speed, people flocked to Songjiang, and rice flowed into Shanghai." However, the rice in Songjiang County will not spring up from the ground. After being stimulated by the high rice prices in Shanghai and flowing out without limit, the problem of food for the residents of Songjiang County itself will inevitably become more severe. Indeed, on the day after June 2nd (Shanghai's rice price actually reached 0.00 yuan on June 2nd, and Songjiang's rice price also rose to 0.00 yuan), the county government convened an emergency liaison meeting of various agencies and, after deliberation, took measures to prohibit rice exports and announce agreed-upon rice prices. Due to this measure, for about three or four days from the 3rd onward, the Songjiang rice market was in a state of uncertain prices and stalled transactions.</p>
<p>It seems that more than just Songjiang County has implemented the above-mentioned self-defense measures. Therefore, on the 5th, the Ministry of Industry issued an order to local governments to withdraw the "illegal movement restrictions." Regarding this issue, people in Songjiang said:</p>
<p>"Rice policies should not only be formulated from Shanghai's perspective. Such policies are clumsy and deceptive. No matter what kind of rice-producing area it is, the amount of rice is limited. If we take the approach of indiscriminately transporting everything to Shanghai, it may be good for Shanghai, but there is nothing more difficult for the producing area of Songjiang. If Shanghai's rice prices were to stabilize greatly as a result, we would be willing to do so, but the rice that is transported becomes the target of speculation and hoarding. Although there are speculative ups and downs, there is no improvement at all. In this way, wouldn't the suffering of the rice-producing areas be in vain? After the rice price in Songjiang soared, what about this year's purchases? Our current search for emergency means is not for any other purpose, but simply a measure we are forced to take for the sake of the people's livelihood in Songjiang. Moreover, even with this measure, a considerable amount of rice is still being transported out as if it were nothing."</p>
<p>Whether these measures and views are reasonable is for the reviewers and authorities to judge, but when Shanghai announced the abolition of movement restrictions, Songjiang announced the restriction of movement; when Shanghai's rice prices are at least currently left to "natural forces," Songjiang announced agreed-upon market prices; and when Shanghai's distribution is suspended, Songjiang can be said to be implementing preliminary distribution, with the county government adopting a protection policy of purchasing a fixed amount of food rice with county resident certificates. These are major realities that need to be resolved by the temporary directives issued by the Ministry of Industry. Such phenomena probably exist in other areas besides Songjiang, although in different forms. Therefore, it is hoped that various governments will directly face the new situations in various areas and move towards establishing comprehensive countermeasures that will not cause contradictions and conflicts between Shanghai and various areas. This is not just my personal wish.</p>
<p>Rice Trains</p>
<p>From June 3rd onward, the number of solo merchants who rushed to Songjiang Station to sell rice to Shanghai has greatly decreased. This can be said to be the result of the new measures taken by the Songjiang County Government. However, from the 7th, there seems to be a sign of gradual increase. At 3:00 PM on the 6th, a train of about 1,200 people, and four trains of about 4,800 people, carrying two dou, three dou, or even more than one shi of rice, traveled daily between Shanghai and Songjiang. It is said that usually there are no fewer than 2,000 people a day. In addition to Songjiang, they also go to Jiashan and other stations. In total, there are more than 10,000 solo merchants mobilized to buy rice along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line. The trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Line have simply become rice trains and solo merchant trains. After completing the survey of the rice market situation in Songjiang, I waited at the train station for the last train to arrive and witnessed the chaos, shouting, and disorder caused by the arrival of the solo merchant army. The station staff said:</p>
<p>"There is always a large crowd of thousands of people rushing towards the train from all directions. It is simply impossible to organize them. Most of them do not go through the ticket gate to board the train. They wait for the train to arrive around the station like a troop, and when the train arrives, they all rush forward. Some stuff rice and their bodies into the train through the windows of the third-class carriages, some cross the border and invade the second-class carriages, and some climb onto the roof of the train. In short, all places where rice can be defended and a foothold can be found are completely occupied and utilized by them. There are very many people who ride without tickets or have tickets that have not been checked. Inside the Songjiang Station fence, a moat is dug outside the railway line. There, someone specializes in passing rice and people across the moat, and the business is very good. These things make us physically and mentally exhausted. Fortunately, it has been slightly reduced recently, but it has gradually started to increase again after the 8th. Just yesterday, someone was fatally injured while rushing to board a train that had already started moving."</p>
<p>From these words alone, it is not difficult to imagine how chaotic the actual situation is. On trains arriving in Songjiang from Shanghai, there are at least thirty or forty people sitting on the roof. Witnessing this situation, I couldn't help but think of the scene during the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan. From this, one can also see what the most chaotic period was like. Among the solo merchants, there are not only old solo merchants who have been in this business for a long time, but also patrolmen, government officials, prostitutes, etc., whose occasional or temporary solo trading is also very numerous. They flock to the rice stores in Songjiang, rushing to buy all the rice in the stores. No matter how you think about it, this state of affairs cannot be said to be a normal movement of goods. The purpose of abolishing rice movement restrictions is to eliminate private smuggling, right? But the phenomenon of "private smuggling" is so rampant. Is this really a transient phenomenon? If we want to make this situation a transient phenomenon, we must eradicate the root causes of the prosperity of abnormal commercial behavior under the decisive battle. If we do not do this, even if this phenomenon disappears, it will appear in a deformed and more profound new phenomenon. While talking with the station staff, I couldn't help but feel keenly that the rice problem is indeed easier said than done.

<h3 id="e6">Intense Fighting in Normandy Taking Place Along Three Fronts Allied Forces Continue Landing in Cotentin Peninsula <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- The German authorities announced on the 17th that the Allied forces have now advanced beyond the range of naval artillery fire. At present, combat is taking place on three fronts: 1. In the Orne area, the German army is strengthening its counterattack from the east. 2. The German army is still heavily engaging the British army advancing south. 3. The American army, with powerful forces, is currently attempting to advance westward from Sainte-Mère-Église. The first phase of each of these battles has ended.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- According to front-line news, the Allied forces, under the cover of naval artillery fire, have landed new forces in the Cotentin Peninsula.</p>
<p>Approximately 30 Divisions of Invading Troops</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th</p>
<p>News from the German News Agency: There is no news from the European invasion front in the past 24 hours. Judging from the number of prisoners and equipment, it can be estimated that there are at least 30 divisions of Allied forces in Normandy. The above number does not include engineers, heavy artillery units, and other special forces. The troops under General Montgomery are now mostly fighting on the European invasion front, but General Montgomery is no longer able to launch large-scale offensives, as the remaining five to eight divisions of troops that can be transferred must be used to supplement the British and American forces currently fighting west of the Orne River and in the Sainte-Mère-Église area.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses, Objectives Not Achieved</p>
<p>It is currently estimated that approximately 40% of the troops under the command of General Eisenhower have been engaged. Most importantly, General Montgomery has not been able to achieve his assigned operational objectives despite using such a large number of troops. To date, he has not been able to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula and occupy the important seaport of Cherbourg. Although the Allied forces' occupation of Sainte-Vicomte on the 16th has helped to cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, the conquest of Normandy has not yet been realized. Therefore, it is questionable whether General Eisenhower will launch the second phase of his invasion before completing his first task. Currently, a large number of naval and transport ships and landing craft are being engaged in the Seine estuary area. General Eisenhower may wait until he has occupied the Cotentin Peninsula and Cherbourg before launching his next operation.</p>
<p>Preparing to Launch Second Phase of Operations</p>
<p>But it is also possible that the time set by the Teheran Conference has arrived, and he will have to launch the second phase of operations even before the first phase has ended. It is estimated that General Eisenhower has approximately 50 to 60 divisions of troops that can be deployed in this operation, including four airborne divisions. This large army is on standby on the south coast of England and in the area between London and the Humber estuary. From this, it can be seen where the second landing will take place. In general, General Eisenhower will use a large portion of these troops to attempt to occupy the coast between Ostend and Dunkirk and advance to the northeast and southwest.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Intense Fighting on Elba <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- The German authorities announced that at 3:00 AM on the 17th, the Allied forces landed on the southern part of Elba Island in the western Italian coastal sea, using more than 60 landing craft. They also landed north of the island and west of Porto Azzurro on the southeast coast, and fierce fighting is underway.</p>
<p>Situation in Italy</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 18th -- DNB reports: On the Italian front, German forces in the Albegna and Paglia river valleys have checked the enemy's advance units, but were later ordered to retreat to Chiusi. German forces west of Lake Bolsena have been retreating to Montefiascone under pressure from the American Fifth Army in order to engage the enemy head-on in a location suitable for defensive warfare. The German army's current operational strategy in Italy is to engage a large enemy force and inflict heavy losses on them in battle.</p>
<h3 id="e8">German Secret Weapon Attacks England Again; Bombing Range Widens <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports from London that large numbers of German "Robert Planes" flew to southern England again on Saturday night. The altitude of these planes is extremely high.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): The bombing of the English mainland by German unmanned aircraft continued until the night of the 16th. On the 17th, the bombing range became even wider. It paused at noon, but after noon, they flew in again, becoming more intense at night. The British Home Office issued a public statement on the 17th, acknowledging that the area from London to Bristol was subjected to unmanned aircraft bombing, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. These unmanned aircraft flew across the strait every twenty minutes to a maximum of one hour. On the 17th, ordinary manned aircraft flew over British territory, not for bombing, nor to guide unmanned aircraft, but to scout the effectiveness of the unmanned aircraft bombing.</p>
<p>Amazing Power of 'Meteor' Bombs</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports that, according to the Supreme Headquarters of the Anti-Axis Allied Forces, the Germans again dropped "Meteor" bombs on southern England yesterday. It is said that the structure of the bomb is unusually simple, resembling a rocket firework toyed with by children on holidays. It has wings and contains one ton of explosives, resulting in a very large explosion. These bombs are launched from the Baris area of the French coast, which is about twenty miles across the English Channel and are not controlled by radio.</p>
<p>Fire Across the Channel Lights Up the Sky</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency): According to news, after the British mainland was attacked by the new German weapons, the southern area suffered heavy damage. From Angers (200 kilometers from the British mainland), the great fire on the southern coast of England could be seen. The fire intensified at night, and the flames illuminated the English Channel, which was extremely spectacular. As the burning range has gradually expanded, the sky above the British mainland is reddish-yellow.</p>
<p>Britain Studies Defensive Strategies</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency): Reuters reports from London that British air defense commander General Bill spent the weekend in an area of the southern coast of England, studying defensive strategies against the new German weapons with senior military officers and scientific experts.</p>
<p>London Forced to Evacuate Residents</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (German News Agency): After Germany used new explosive weapons against London and southern England, the British government has been forced to order the evacuation of London. Air raid shelters and tunnel stations are not strong enough to resist these explosions. Londoners are now relocating on a large scale to take shelter. The Germans claim that while the current target of the attacks is primarily London, soon, Portsmouth, Southampton, Plymouth, and other important industrial centers and ports in southern England will suffer the same fate as London.</p>

<h3 id="e10">First District Economic Security Office Cracks Down on Illegal Hoarding; No Intention of Forcibly Buying Materials <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The First District Police Department's Economic Security Office has only been established since April 1st, and its initial work has been focused on internal preparations, such as personnel selection. Currently, the work is still in the first stage. In the past, it took over the material registration handled by the Material Investigation Committee in the first district. The various trade associations guided their members to register. At the same time, in addition to cracking down on illegal hoarding, those in charge of the office have elaborated on the following points in detail: They are recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the registration of coal, soap, matches, and candles, the authorities have absolutely no intention of forcibly buying them. I hope the public will not misunderstand. The explanation of hoarding is that all industries or factories that hoard materials and are deemed to increase production during wartime will not be punished. As for non-industry or non-member illegal hoarding of materials, they will be severely punished according to the law. As for the recent manipulation of wooden racks and hoarding of rice by unscrupulous merchants, those with concrete evidence will be handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for handling. Other personnel will be released. The authorities, in consideration of the people, will try to avoid judicial punishment for citizens who violate the economic laws promulgated by the National Government due to misunderstanding or misinterpretation. In the near future, economic cases will be handled according to the rules drafted by the Shanghai Special Municipal Law Committee, which will be promulgated soon. The director has ordered the sub-bureaus to prevent police officers from abusing their power or interfering in economic cases. They should not arbitrarily punish overloaded vehicles. Regarding the economic police security patrol team, they must have the following conditions in order to exercise their powers. Citizens should pay attention: (A) An armband with "Economic Security Police" written on it in yellow characters on a red background. (B) A badge. (C) Identification. (D) A group of two or more people. Currently, most are in groups of three or more. As for those in plain clothes, they only investigate hoarding and do not exercise the power of detention. Other work of the office in the future will be announced from time to time. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention and cooperate to crack down on illegal hoarding, suppress prices, and benefit the people.</p>

<p>Household Salt Sales Begin</p>
<p>Regarding the allocation of household salt, it is reported that the salt industry unified distribution agency has distributed a large amount of edible salt to the official salt shops and notified the Lianbao Jia chiefs to print the certificates and distribute them to residents. Residents can purchase one catty of edible salt from the designated official salt shops with the certificate. However, some are made by official salt shops and sent to the Lianbao field office for distribution to residents, and the price per catty is not uniform. Sales have gradually begun. It is also reported that 10,000 dan of edible salt were transported from the producing area last week. In addition to allocating a portion to the official salt shops for household salt needs, the Longchang Salt Company directly allocated the remaining portion to tea garden shops, various trade associations, various agencies, and those who introduced households.</p>

<p>The government authorities are promoting wartime conservation of materials. The Supreme National Defense Council and the Executive Yuan have also passed restrictions on national banquets. In the city, the Social Welfare Bureau has also convened relevant agencies, organizations, and representatives of the Chinese and Western restaurant trade associations to discuss and decide to start restricting national banquets from July 1st. In order to sincerely respond, the City Savings Association specially invited Ding Mocun, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau, to broadcast at the Shanghai Radio Station yesterday. However, because Ding went to the capital to visit his mother-in-law, he was unable to accept the invitation. Therefore, Chen Dongbai, the director, was temporarily asked to broadcast last night. The topic was "From the Implementation of Savings to the Restriction of National Banquets." Chen elaborated on the significance of implementing savings in the wartime system, the waste of national banquets in the past, and the points that should be advocated in the future to restrict banquets and promote savings.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Nanshi Health Authorities Inspect Epidemic Prevention Certificates <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Nanshi Office of the Municipal Health Bureau has been ordered to preside over the epidemic prevention work in the entire Nanshi area. In order to eradicate the source of the epidemic and ensure that citizens are universally vaccinated against the epidemic, the 25th and 26th inspection teams were assigned to conduct door-to-door inspections in the area starting on the 16th to ensure thoroughness. The office issued a notice to the two inspection teams yesterday that if counterfeit epidemic prevention certificates are found during the inspection, the person and the certificate should be brought to the office for thorough investigation. The matter concerns the entire epidemic prevention effort and should not be treated lightly.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Schoolchildren Addicted to Wuxia Novels Run Away to Deep Mountains; Schools Should Pay Attention to Extracurricular Reading Materials <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Deren, Xu Yunlong, Chen Ju, Wang Jiayu, Zhang Binsheng, Wang Longyu, and Wang Jinxing, seven students from Mingde Primary School on Tianping Road, Xujiahui, suddenly went missing at the same time at about 7 am on the 2nd of this month. After searching in many ways, nothing was found. The Security Office of the city, considering that the matter concerned local security, secretly ordered the team members to search in all directions, led by team leader Yuan Baolin. Finally, they were all captured in Jinjia Village, Ma'anshan, on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui. The seven children have been brought back to Shanghai a few days ago and their parents have been notified to take them back.</p>
<p>According to team leader Gu Sailin, after learning that the seven children had abandoned their families and ran away suddenly, the team immediately sent special high-level personnel to search in all directions. Soon, they learned that the reason for the seven children's escape was that they usually read too many wuxia novels and were obsessed with cultivating immortality. Their destination was mountainous areas. Therefore, team members were assigned to search in Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. According to the report of Wu Gongqi, the squad leader in charge of Nanjing, who found Wang Youcheng, they left on June 5th and moved to Zhongshan Mausoleum, Xuanwu Lake, Confucius Temple, Jiming Temple, and other places to search, but there was no trace. They went to various places to search again on the 7th, and finally, they were captured in Jinjia Village, Ma'anshan, on the border between Jiangsu and Anhui. They were led back to Shanghai all the way on the 10th, which was a great fortune. Therefore, in order to avoid the recurrence of such cases in the future, it is hoped that the school authorities in the city will pay special attention to students' extracurricular reading materials so that children will not be anesthetized by wuxia novels.</p>
