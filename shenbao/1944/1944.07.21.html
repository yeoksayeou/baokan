<h3 id="c1">地方行政一席談 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>出席地方行政社座談會</p>
<p>民國廿六年以後，因為戰事關係，地方行政早已無所表見於大眾，也不為大眾所注意。很多縣長來自特殊關係，根本談不到「行政」，所以人民的痛苦日益加深。然而京實際而言，如期和平區內政治成功，國民政府地位强化，它的基礎，都應從地方行政做起。本市有志於地方行政之士，聯合優秀專家，發行地方行政月刊，它的任務，　對於地方行政的原理，學說，制度作研究批評或介紹。地方行政的計劃方案之建議，行政經騐之實錄，通訊統計材料之調查等等。是在和平區內比較專門的刊物，非常需要。昨天該社招待諮詢會常務委員的座談會中，命我發表意見，我就拉雜貢獻如次：</p>
<p>我們說過中央政治是點，省政是錢，縣政是面。和平區內最弱的一環是面。內政部長梅思平氏上次到滬，我曾於十二日晨專程往訪，特別談判地方行政。梅氏是對地方行政富有經騐的專家，曾任江寗模范縣長多年。我就舊事重提，當面要求改善地方行政，希望在江蘇，浙江，安徽各省選擇重要縣份，樹立模範地方行政。梅氏答說，已在南京郊區考慮此問題，着手準備，雖無模範縣之名，而將推行模範縣政之實。這是很可欣幸之事，希望早成事實。</p>
<p>我們對於上海成為全國政治模範區，期待已久。相信陳市長曁吳秘書長都具此信念。尤其從去年八月一日接收租界以來，更是加强此信念。怎樣可以逐漸實現？怎樣的表現？第一，能否確立完善的行政制度？第二，能否健全人事，使一親耳目？如果制度雖能改善，而人事不能健全，則換湯不換藥，上述信念是不能實現的。中國政治上最大難關是人事問題，曁如政府機關的設置，不過養官吏，養私人，那末，行政機關不免變成官僚機關，不過在官樣文書上轉圈子，變成公文行政。做長官的誰有勇氣打破人事難關，誰就成功。我們很相信陳市長非常坦白眞誠，不用私人，包容各方面人才。為了上海成為模範區，就特別希望在今年八月一日市政機關合併以前，對於原有人員嚴格的甄别，一新耳目，這是上海地方行政能否樹立模範的關鍵。我們相信市政機關各局處長大多數有懷抱，協助市長建設新上海。可是，也不可否認的尚有少數不能稍職的，尤其是各局處幹部中不能稱職者，希望乘此機會予以公平的考核。當然，一方面對於優秀人才，優良制度，應當保留。</p>
<p>最後，我在座談會意見的結論：第一，希望上海市範圍內的七縣，每縣部都成為模範縣，每縣的縣長都是專家，這樣才能改變上海近郊的惡劣環境，保衛上海的治安。我將準備在下次諮詢會提出建議。同時，希望地方行政社的專家，參加建設地方行政的工作。第二，「地方行政」雖然是一本月刊，可是，它是吸收推行地方行政有志人士的好園地，希望它逐漸長大。並將言論推廣，發生效力，俾使各地都能樹立地方行政的模範。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍猛攻英德　突入九龍墟　襲粵渝機擊落十架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>廣州二十日中央社電　日軍銳部隊在粵省北部山岳地帶，對渝軍展開包圍殲滅戰，已使死守之渝第七戰區軍陷於混亂。日軍復渡過連江，沿山道猛攻英德西部渝軍前兩陣地，十九日突入九龍墟，更迫擊山岳帶殘餘之渝軍，死守該地之渝主力百五十四師，獨立第九旅已負重創。據云，渝第七戰區司令長官余漢謀，曾由韶關方面增派援軍，親自督戰，盡力保衛英德，現該地已集中兵力約五師之眾，刻日戰意倍極旺盛，仍對渝軍壓縮包圍圈中。</p>
<p>大陸基地二十日中央社電　十九日下午二時許，曾有渝機P61及P40型二十餘架，分數隊侵入廣州西方四十公里附近，日機隊當與之展開激烈空戰，擊落其四架（內一架未證實），擊毀六架。</p>
<p>華南前綫日軍某基地二十日中央社電　日軍佔領清遠縣城後更急追渝軍，一路北上，勇向某地進攻，刻正以大同墟為中心，展開殲滅作戰。至十二日判明之綜合戰果如次：渝軍棄屍八二八具，俘虜二〇八人，平射砲四門，重槍機一挺，迫擊砲一門，輕機槍九挺，及其他槍械子彈甚夥云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　　據重慶電，渝軍當局十九日夜發表戰况，謂衡陽地區日軍，曾於十八日猛攻渝軍各陣地，蟄居於衡陽　市內之渝軍守備部隊，可聞外側新市街之槍聲。</p>
<h3 id="c3">小磯米內兩大將拜命協力組新閣　東條內閣十八日實行總辭 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日組閣本部二十日下午八時五十五分首次發表：朝鮮總督小磯氏承召，於本日下午三時五十六分參內，本日小磯陸軍大將與米內海軍大將拜受協力組閣之大命。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日東條內閣十八日總辭職，日情節報局頃發表東條內閣總辭職理由如次：自大戰勃發以來，政府即與大本營緊密協力，於完遂戰爭上作種種努力，際此非常之決戰，舉國邁進完遂戰爭，內閣乃行總辭，而認為宜讓與更有力內閣，東條總理大臣乃備齊閣員辭表，於十八日上午晋宮，拜謁天皇陛下，奏明斯旨。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　東條內閣總辭職後，星野書記官長，天羽情報避總裁，森山法制局長平均價格三氏亦提出辭呈。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日內務三要員唐澤次官，町村警保局長，藤田警視總監，於東條內閣總辭職後，即向安藤內相提出辭呈。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日重臣舉行會議奏荐最適當人選　小磯東條兩大將作重要會談 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　日東條內閣為應付當前重大戰局，一新人心，傾舉全國總力，確立完遂戰爭之基盤，東條首相即於是日十一時四十分進宮，謁見天皇奏上閣員辭呈，日本天皇陛下崠垂詢後繼內閣人選於木戶大臣，為微求各重臣之意見，是日下午四時，於宮內舉行重臣會議，參集昔日之首相若　禮次郎男爵，岡田啓介海　軍大將，廣田引毅氏，近衛文麿公爵，平沼騏一郎男爵，阿部信行陸軍大將，米內光政海軍大將，並前樞密院議長等，對此次重大時局下組織後繼內閣問題，開誠發表意見，協議結果，認為朝野總督小磯國昭達軍大將及米內光政海軍大將為最適當人選，蒙賜見，三奏荐小磯陸軍大將與米內光政海軍大將繼行組閣，於是負責組織後繼內閣之大命，遂降於朝鮮總督小磯大將與米內大將。小磯總督即於二十日上午十一時十五分由京城出發，於下午二時五十分飛抵東京羽田機塲，與米內大將於三時五十分前後晋謁日本天皇，當蒙賜見，兩氏遂受命組織內閣。小磯總督於五時五十分退出後，立赴首相官邸訪東條首相，作重要會談。至六時四十五分辭出，米內大將亦於下午四時再開重臣會議完畢後退席，兩氏相協力，鑒於苛烈戰局之推移，不克稍逸時機，為迅速完畢清新强力之內閣開始組閣工作。</p>
<h3 id="c5">日國民期望　强力新內閣 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　東條首相組閣以來，已歷二年零九閱以來，至十八日始行總辭職，東條首相組閣二月，大東亞戰爭即勃發，斯時東條內閣即於中日滿締盟及日德義軸心之堅强結合下，努力從事擊滅英·美及建設大東亞共勞圈之工作。自昭和十六年十二月八日拜受宣戰大詔後，即於八紘一宇之精神下，為確立世界永久和平基礎起見，而以迅雷不及掩耳之速度，一舉將東亞方面英美之侵略據點予以覆滅，直至今日，始終與大本營緊密聯擊，羣策羣力，為樹立必勝體制而邁進。然是時因處英·美制霸世界野望之逼迫，未能得暇充分整備逼迫，未能得暇充分整備國內戰爭體制，即捲入此次大東亞戰爭之漩渦中，此點乃係東條內閣所最為關心者，故於組閣後，即迅速完成舉國皆戰之體制，期發揮全力，供獻於聖戰，始能確立今日之戰時體制，此種豐功偉績，實不容忽視，然最近太平洋戰局已至決戰期，且情勢嚴重已非昔比，當茲時機，日本全國國民均期待有更為明確之政治措置，故東條內產各遂提出總辭職，東條內閣之總辭職，雖出於日本國民意料之外，然因日本國體本異於世界各國，故此舉對於日本國民，決無强烈之刺激，而全國國民所期望者，即為有更强力清新之內閣出現。</p>

<p>東京二十日中央社電　日小磯陸軍大將，拜受大命，出而組閣後，其陸軍士官學校時代之同期學友牛島貞雄中將，特就此事發表談話如次：余與小磯氏乃陸軍軍士官學校與陸軍大學時代之同學，當余任少校時代，更與小磯氏同服務於參謀本部，後余任陸大敎官時，小磯氏任陸軍省軍務局長，故余之半生中可謂與小磯氏為半生知交。小磯氏雖有一見令人生畏之顏，然其另一方面，却具非常細心之性格，對任何事均事先有緊密之考慮，故於各同事中，常抱有較他人高尚之見解，同時，氏又持有力行之精神，今後以一國之首相而出任，相信其必與平時無異，對此重大戰局，大膽踏破怒濤，次第而進。按小磯氏於任朝鮮軍司令官司之時，曾被呼為「朝鮮之虎」，今日世人所期待者，即為此出檻之虎將有如何舉動。小磯氏於現役軍人時，曾任陸軍次官，關東軍參謀長，朝鮮軍司令官，及為預備軍之時，更曾二任拓務大臣，故小磯氏實為一力行將軍也。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電　諾曼第戰綫德軍已發表，德軍撤退桑洛，反軸心軍當局亦稱，英軍突破克恩德軍陣地，美軍庶斷桑洛及佩里耶公路，結果德軍遂放棄桑洛，此次蒙高茂萊亦用突破字樣尚屬創舉，由此可見此次作戰絕不止於局部作戰，其空中準備攻擊，亦較過去激烈，尤其英空軍轟炸機已開始參加白畫轟炸，凡此均為反軸心軍決意之表現，故今後事態之演變，頗堪注目也。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍已撤離桑洛廢墟，現在該城之南據守新陣地，將美軍之攻擊皆加以擊退，鄧普賽將軍之英第二軍，自奧爾納河之東岸對狄維克斯河及克恩南面之地區攻擊，仍未稍懈，但德軍已採有效之對策。克恩西南之局勢無變動，敵軍在貝萊及特洛恩地區之企圖，皆於星期三被擊退，德軍在該地區之西南，曾克復數地而向前進。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期二日中午，英軍以空前緊張之掩護砲火與飛機一千架以上為準備，由奧爾納河以東之橋頭堡，向東方與南方發動進攻，其目的顯然在於抵達東方之狄夫河兩岸，並向南進展數公里，以便折而向西以進抵克恩以北之奧爾納河。星期二日傍晚與夜間，克恩東南若干小村屢得屢失，屢次易主，星期三日上午雙方以生力軍加入作戰，戰事愈見緊張，克恩之西南，情形比較平靜，大槪因英軍已將其焦點移至奧納河東岸之故，但同時在諾耳凡特斯區，則有劇烈之戰爭，最後結果，德軍向南撤退一公里。</p>

<p>中央海軍學校校長海軍中將姜西園於二十日晚九時十分廣播演講，題為「新時代的海與新時代的虫國」茲錄原詞如下：</p>
<p>海洋風氣</p>
<p>「今天是盟邦日本的第四回海之紀念日，這種「海的紀念日」在我國一般人的觀念着起來，是並沒有什麽特殊意義的。但是我們要仔細想一想，盟邦日木之所以能有世界的飛躍，乃至担任起今日大東亞共榮建設的重要任務，實在是因為有海洋風氣的潑刺民族受了激盪，奮揚蹈厲，承時而起，迎頭趕上了世界的一切水準，不數十年便很快的成功了最前進而最隆盛的國家。返觀我國國民，一向守着大陸的保守舊習，凡事因陋就簡，茍且偸安，妄自尊大自以文化自許，終致事事落後，主要的原因，可以說大陸性的缺乏調劑，久久反應，成為毒化作用。所以今後我們要利用海洋的性能，造成一種偉大的風氣，來換新幾千年來民族的　結，好向大東亞共熒的前途來開展，所以由這一個觀點來講，大東亞戰爭對於我國的嘉惠，將要像海一般的無量無邊的。</p>
<p>說起來古來我國偉大思想家對於海的觀念，是極盡推崇之能事了。舉凡廣大無涯的事，都是用海來代表，不過這種崇尚觀念，總免不了為的廣大無邊以及海的風濤險惡所驚懼，有點望洋興歎，天下國家，限終四海之內，四海以外，只有存而不論了。</p>
<p>海運威力</p>
<p>科學的進化，使海上交通比較陸上反爲方便、海運的能力，遠超於陸通海軍的威力，遠達重洋世界上的文化，經濟乃至戰爭，均以海洋之共同性而息息相關，久困在大陸的中國，至此當然不能例外。可是幾千年的民族惰性，很不容易一下士有什麼急激的變化。現當大柬亞戰爭之時侯，東亞民族共同的前途受了西洋渡海而來的威脅，我們一不能長此作大陸茍活自安之夢，二不能再作兄弟閱墻之爭，海洋使中國覺悟，必然在大東亞團結之下，方能生存。過去的海對終中國只是一種抽象的偉天，新時代的海，乃是人們吐故納新的生活元素，不過中國所需要的更為深切罷了。</p>
<p>海上的事業，維擊人類生活的大部，海上任務的執行，則為海軍與海運，平時則海軍維持海上仟務的執行，則為海軍與海運，平時海軍維持海上的治安，以保障海運的安全，戰時則海運担任物資的運輸，補給海上軍需。這兩種任務好像車的兩個輪子，相輔而行缺一不可，這回太平洋作戰的盟邦海軍英勇無敵為世界所共欽佩，但是其海運界的活躍，亦絕不稍遜，運輸船員之情神與海軍將士之傳統精神，一般無二，其艱苦卓絕殺敵致果的功績，也一般無二。我們對於他們為大東亞共榮的供獻謹致同樣的感謝與崇敬。</p>
<p>建設海軍</p>
<p>我們的新海軍，建設已有五年的經過，國人想都已大概知道，在此不多加介紹，我們的海運建設一向尙無所聞，但是自最近之中央高等商船學校學生第一期與中央海軍學校學生第六期同時入校，以及普通船之在中央水兵訓練所同時養成，我國海運界可謂正在開始，這樣海軍與海運雙管齊下，實在是含有新時代的偉大意義，久困在大陸思想習慣的國民，對此當更有所啓發，幷切望對此新典之海洋軍業，予以新的認識及切實的援助，將來新時代的「海」，不再爲國人所漠視，除了建國建軍海軍海運等政府設施以外，一般尤當注意者，如學術思想風俗習慣興趣，均在要有海的特性參入在內，繪畫家要描繪驚濤駭浪，碧海晴軓，或健美的軍艦雄麗的商輪，音樂家要誚出澎湃汪洋悠遠曠達之致，文學家要有洋洋灑灑浩浩蕩蕩的文詞詩句，或海上的記述，遊歷家不以五嶽歸來為光榮而以曾經滄海相號召，學術家要有海外搜奇探　得珠之興會，如是以鼓盪海洋風氣，深入於民族生活習慣之中，於海軍海運之建設，以及中華之興復，東亞之勝利，均將直接間接有莫大之裨助，新時代勿寗謂之為海之時代，有海的作用，才有時代的立塲，尤其是踏上了大東亞戰爭之途，而具有很長海岸綫的中國。</p>

<h3 id="c33">敵前回頭 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>今日日本內閣情報局發表，東條首相「為一新人心，俾舉國向完遂戰爭之途遇進計」，於十八日決定內閣總辭職，當即提呈全體閣員辭表。十八日係公布塞班島失陷，調任梅津關東軍司令官為參謀總長之日，亦即野村直邦大將就任海軍大臣之翌日。見此接二連三發生之事件，美英宣傳機關其將誇大日本已陷入「難局一，而自詡其軍事及政治之成功乎？彼等對於島田大將之辭去海軍大臣及柬條大將之辭去參謀總長，即已宣稱此與塞班島之失陷有關，並致力穴傳此係所謂「絕望的日本狀態」之最尖說的表現。是故彼輩聆悉東條內閣總職職之訊時，必將大喜若狂，益肆其毒口。固然，日木若於坦蕩的勝利大道上前進時，此類事情將不致發生。然而正如東條大將於塞班島陷落時所言者，日本現已「處於有史以來之重大局面」，舉國上下，堅持必勝信念，終此重大局面中握取「擊滅敵人而取勝的絕妙機會」，更加緊結集其總力。於此過程中，為一新人心，俾舉國向完遂戰爭之途邁進計，業已完成一時使命之東條內閣。遂宣吿辭職。於此可知日本比次政變對終完遂戰爭實有甚大的積極意義。此與戰史上有名的日本海海戰時的「敵前回頭」，即所謂東鄕轉回，有同樣意義。當時，困有此種大胆的「敵前回頭」，始能握取赫然大勝的機會。於敵前實施此種果敢的措置，原係大冒險，如在擁有壓倒敵國之戰力，而可從容向目標前進時，此種自險本無必要。唯此次改變乃係日木準備處理曠古重大局面而毅然實行者。由美英一想情願的立塲而言，固認之為日本所處危局之最尖銳表現，但此純係盾之一面。暗懼日木最後一擊的美英，祇是故意蔽住其另一面。此種事實，即在彼等最圓滑之宜傳中，亦屢屢顯露蛛絲馬跡，實屬不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>其次，美英以東條內閣總辭職為日本戰爭體制之崩潰而大事宣傳，亦屬意中事。唯此類宣傳僅足暴露彼等對於日木國體與政體之味然無知而已。彼輩目覩日本國內各個政治現象，曲解日木為法西斯主義的政治體制，認認柬條大將為其指導者獨裁者。此種見解之不値一顯，凡日木國民及眞正理解日木者，無不一目暸然。日本之政治體制與德義根本不同，故以柬條大將比擬希特勒或墨索里尼，殊屬失當。何況視東條內園辭職為日木戰爭勢態崩潰之美英見解。無非是一種自慰之想。關於日本之國體及政體，容日後有機會時再行錄分說明，但為剖析美英宣傳機關饒舌之眞相計，用特終此指明。總之，由於此種果敢的「敵前回頭」而愈形高昻的日本國民之戰意，將使彼等痛感自慰之虛幻。</p>
<h3 id="c34">一警局決取締　區內非法押當　民衆可向當局檢舉 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>本市第一警察局行政處，因查押當應取利率，法有明定，但目下本市間有一般押當，不按規定，或竟擅增利率及縮短當期，同時更有以商行商號之名義，而私自擅營押當及押票業務者，亦有人以高租借貸，即所謂「印子錢，以重利盤剝，實屬非法，且易引起糾紛。該處以行政警察之任務，以維護民衆利益為使命，對上項情事丞應嚴密調查，切實取締，以蘇民艱。故已令飭各分局行政股，對管轄區內之押當營業情形，須確切調查塡表呈報，以便查處。</p>
<p>處罰辦法</p>
<p>至於處罰辦法，據記者得悉，　凡典當不按照規定利率，或縮短常期者，或商號商行私營押當押票，或有人高利貸借，剝削平民者，民衆均可向當局檢舉查辦。　對執有營業執照之典當，有進章營業者，初犯依違章營業處罰，並將違章營業部份，勒令停照，再犯吊銷執照，並移解地檢署依法究辦。　商行商號私營押當業務，而其利率未超越規定者，以無執照處罰，勒令其停止押當部份，而其營押富或所取利率當期不合法令者，當移解地檢署依法究辦。　其他一般人以高利盤剝者，視其情節輕重依法究辦。</p>
<p>舊貨商號</p>
<p>又該處因查本市現在一般舊貨商號商行，以及其他類似營業商店之設立，為數日增。其業務爲舊貨買賣，而其爲銷滅贓物之處所，及養成竊盜犯罪之慣行，過去租界對於此種商店，並無領執照之規定，且不管理，不無放任。茲爲防止上項情事之發生，故經呈請一區公署辦理是項營業執照，並由該區嚴格管理，對舊貨商號須將每日營業情形，塡表呈報，以便調查，免為竊盜銷滅贓物，而維治安。</p>

<p>— 潘養抽</p>
<p>鎭鄉保長，也是佐治人負中之一員，他們的職責，對於上級政府的政令，應切實傳遞奉行，對於人民的疾苦，須誠意建議改革，同時，關於治安的人口遷入搬出，關於民生的糧食收集配給等事項，都由他們握着原動力，是故差使雖微，賣任很大，非具有政治學識行政經騐而深明大義的人們，實不能勝任的。</p>
<p>現在鎭鄉保長，賢明者固有，但大都不學無術之輩，或者夤緣躦營到乎的，這般人們，平日平時無所幫助政府己屬不合，又復狐假虎威，利用職權，剝削入民，侵占詐欺，無處不用其極，這樣的鎭鄉保長，喻為民間蝗虫，實不過也。</p>
<p>所以欲口誅筆伐，一方面促政府注意，根本刷新政治，須先愼用鎭鄉保長，一方面冀不堪勝任的一般鎭鄉保長，認淸時務速即隱退，筆者並不是危詞恫嚇，試觀七月五日各小報披　露浦東南區一角，鎭鄕保長互控侵占詐欺，現經檢查官提起公訴一事，內容或有誤傳，但未必蓋是虛詞。此案聞於七月十八日復由上海地方法院審詢，將來案內鎭鄕保長三人，受何條法律的制裁，姑且不論，但是市政上一角汚點，已經社會發覺，政府當局思不能置諸不聞不問，不謀改善的了</p>
<p>這樣汚點，遍地皆是，有些染在黑色上的不容易被人發覺了。總之，鎭鄕保長任用不當，不特人民蒙受其害，即政府亦遭損失，反之，賢明的鎭鄉保長，確能佐推政令，解除民間疾苦，所以愼用鎭鄕保長，與任用文官同樣重要，列為刷新政治上的基本要著，無可異議。至於現任鎭鄕保長亟須詳細甄別，逕有不合格者，或予訓練，或即淘汰，一經任用，當以有薪給文官同樣待遇，俾得安心與政府地方服務。</p>

<h3 id="c44">決戰時期的　海洋少年團 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 海軍上將竹下勇</p>
<p>海的紀念日特輯</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，日本全海洋的認識，的確完全轉變了。</p>
<p>我們日本海洋少年團自從成立以來，業已經過了二十年的悠久歷史，在九一八事變前後，該團的發展尚淡不到登峰造處，如夜深人靜捫心自問，日本是一個海國，如想蓬勃發展，則不能不仔　反省</p>
<p>但由一二八事變至七七事變，英美對我日本皇國的壓迫，　本加厲，於是日本國民到於海洋的決心和覺醒，也逐漸加深。總之，「從海上來的敵人必須在海上防禦一這一堅强的海防觀念，自然而然地就湧現出來了。因此，該團的規模，突然向前長足的前進了。</p>
<p>就在這個時期，火東亞戰爭爆發了。在初戰時期，我們日本海軍以柑枯拉巧的閃電戰，佔領了大部太平洋，而空前曠古的大戰果，通串地不斷發表出來，於是一萬萬國民在內心裏，燃燒起感謝海軍的然情，由於這種熱情的蓬勃，而自然造成少年團發展的推動力。海洋精神的研究，被各方面熱烈地注意着，這也可以說是日本必然勝利的基礎，所以在日本國內形成一種風尙，都源源不絕地參加海洋</p>
<p>下面我們就輪廓地加以敘述。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>我從去年五月至今年，，本州各地，以及四國，九州，朝鮮等日本地方，巡視過。並且很規熱地和各地團員個別談話過，也曾親眼看見過他們的勇敢而有希望的資態，但戰爭局面日益艱苦，而一個一個跑到海洋和空巾與敵寇拼命，內心中隱　歲繼續山本元帥道志的靑審。這種可歌可泣的態度，實令興奮　分。</p>
<p>各個地方，市　村的團長在道府縣的海洋少年團長指導之下，親身出馬指揮訓練，最近由於提高了的海洋精神建設，而在積極奪鬥着，又加上直接担任指導的單位團長國民小學校長，以及其他幹部，都廢寢忘食，拼命訓練海洋戰士，這實在令人衷心似服。</p>
<p>這不僅是日本內地如此，其他各地也都如此。旅順和大進不必說，就是年團，也聽說拼命訓練着，但最近這種海洋少年團運動，業已普及於滿洲國，甚至窮鄕　壞的牡丹江市，也組成了海洋少年團的組織。</p>
<p>此外在上海，總領事目抱奮勇，担任支部長，而組成海洋少年團，在海軍特別陸戰隊和長江海軍部隊的指遵下，進行着總訓練。</p>
<p>再需要大書而特書者，就是朝鮮。海洋少年團。朝鮮從老早以前就有　山和鎭海的海洋少年團，但其中的團員，主要是以日本兒童所組成。</p>
<p>但山於情勢的轉變，而去年於半　組成海洋少年團的時候，則以朝鮮人組織了。</p>
<p>這因為取得非常好的結果，所以今後希望總督府，鎭海警備府，海軍武官府等的盡力幫忙，而組識全體朝鮮人的海洋少年團。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>在朝鮮各地所產生的少年團，打成一片，組成全國組織的朝鮮海洋少年團，成立典禮則於本年五月二十七日每軍紀念日這一天，在京城盛火而隆軍地舉行了。這一成立典禮，給與朝鮮人以非常的感激，謚是也給與召募中的海軍志願兵以極好的影響，參加者非常勇躍。此外，發生影嚮者，不僅對於兒童，而且對謚雙親，所以參加少年團的母親們，也都聯合起來，共同走向建設大東亞的康莊大路。</p>
<p>這個朝鮮海洋少年團，在總督府設有大日本海洋少年團朝鮮本部，政務總監自任本部長，於各道設立支部，通知事為支部長，指定全朝鮮一百餘所卞要都市，設立海洋少年團，終於七月二十日的海洋記念日這一天，完成此偉大目的了。</p>
<p>另外在鎭海和元山等各地，曾召集過指遵者訓練火會。現在全部朝鮮的團員數，業已打破八十之多的記錄了。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>以日本海爲練習塲所的新瀉，富山井等各縣，最近已經有了帥的故鄉長岡之長崗海洋少年團，都在心田上熊熊燃燒着　承元帥的遺志烈火。</p>
<p>此外，以東鄕元帥大筆一揮的團旗白篆的三國海洋少年團，和福井，敦賀，金澤，小松等城市，前後媲美着，都在本鄕出身的海洋勇將和前輩的指</p>
<p>還有岩佐軍神的故鄉前橋市，和附近的宇都宮市，日立市，　子市等共同相互就賽前，忙於海洋訓練。</p>
<p>宮殿下常常蒞臨，具有這樣無上光榮的橫濱市海洋少年團，逐漸人數增加了，且也增有海洋訓練所了。</p>
<p>另外，以名古屋為中心的愛知，二重，岐阜等五縣，由於歷史的悠久，而與年俱增也發展着，今日甚至高山等，也即將產生海洋少年團了。由此觀之，可知神武天皇的後裔日本民族，在大東亞戰爭當中，將有如何不可征服的威力。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>大防，京都團，全都在海軍當局的極大援助和指導之下，而忙於在大阪　和昆　湖內訓練中。此外也決不要忽略姬路市海洋靑年隊的優秀卓著訓練。</p>
<p>島取，島根，岡山，廣島方面的海洋少年團的發展，也非非常卓絕。具有上古海洋發展史的島　，以神西湖的海洋訓練所為中心，即將成立全縣的少年團。岡山縣也決不示弱，以岡山市為中心，而努力訓織全縣的海洋少年團。</p>
<p>再試觀四國四縣，普遍地成立了以香川縣為海洋訓練所的海洋少年團。全縣的海洋少年戰士，就是以此為中心，而在積極訓練着。尤其是粟島的海洋少年團，繼承着老早就向海外發展的父兄之後，向七大海奔馳，而都立志生於海，死於海。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>再就是九州，在數量方面，甚至在熱情方面，海洋少年團都要算九州爲最强。尤其是福岡縣，按人數說，爲全國冠，長崎，在鎭守府的直接領導下，全市各校的男女學生都完全加入了。熊本和鹿兒島等，全都不甘人後地努力練習着。</p>
<p>在此所想起者，是記念皇紀二千六百年時，在鹿兒島市所舉行的大日本海洋少年團全國大會。以秘藏肇國歷史的高千穗峯為中心，發展到鹿兒島灣的這種少年團大會，實在是具有深遠意義的，但由富時來看，今日的該團發展，可以說是空前的。</p>
<p>台灣則主要是基隆和高雄，有力的海洋少年團未巳層出不窮了。</p>
<p>台邊自從大東亞戰爭以來，成為南方的補充基地，現在立於極關重要的立塲上。一切旣是如此，當然少年團的發展也會自然而然地向前發展。</p>
<p>七</p>
<p>海洋少年團有如上述，　已普遍發展到日本全國了·現在團數共三千多，團員數已達五十三萬人，且一天比一天地在增加着人數。</p>
<p>但假如想到海洋國的命運時，決不以此為滿足。老實說，全國各地，甚至窮鄕僻壞，必須都要成立海洋少年團。當然現在用不着解說，因為日本海洋少年團是訓練日本少年國民為海國日本的完全國民的機關。戰爭形勢愈益惡劣了，想到必然成為長期戰的太東亞戰爭之將來時，是迫切地希望全國指導者，父兄　以及少年國民本身，必須理解和奮起。（安譯自十一日海洋少年）</p>
<h3 id="c45">臨海實騐所的話 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 高槻俊</p>
<p>臨海實認所研究此在麼呢？它所研</p>
<p>究的是海洋中的形形色色，故別稱海洋研究所。但海洋的範團極廣，就是要知逍其大槪，也談何容易。</p>
<p>例如研究海的成長，或潮的漲落的海洋物理學，研究海水與氣象的關係的海洋氣象學，研究海水與成分組成的海洋化學，研究海岸綫的變化與海底的性質的海洋地質學，及研究棲於海洋中各種生物體的海產生物學，粗粗一看，就已有各種各類的學問了。</p>
<p>臨海實騐所本來的月的，就是將這多方而的學問都加以研究。但並通因研究者與研究所的便利，並不全部都研究。而一般所處理者，多屬於海產生物學方面。又與此一同研究物理學，化學，氣象學的地方亦不少。但特別研究氣蒙的地方稱海洋氣象台，以水產為主的稱水產試駖所，這大家都已知道了</p>
<p>茲先介紹各國的臨海實騐所。</p>
<p>德國有名的臨海實駖所，在北海孤島海裏哥蘭特。創設於距今五十年前，至第一次歐洲大戰後，德國雖在筋疲力盡之秋，尚決意改建這實騐所，置辦近代的設備。可見他們怎樣熱心於學問。</p>
<p>在義大利，風光明媚的拿波里設有臨海實騐所。設備龐大，歷史亦悠久，但設備尚未近代化。但到現在為止，這裏所研究的，對學術界有極大貢獻。此均以海產生物學的研究為主。</p>
<p>提起海洋研究，就要想到地中海沿岸的摩洛哥。麼洛哥有二件事情在全世界出名的，一是賭塲，一是海洋學。何以海洋學盛行於這小主國呢，因為前皇帝對海軍學特別感到與味，而建造了很好的探險船。陳列採集品的博物館和研究所等建築物，設備、都很漂亮。但自皇帝崩駕後的現在，這研究所也似跟着不振。</p>
<p>央國的臨海實騐所在樸利茅斯軍港。這裏所研究的是海產生物學與他們的生命綫英法海峽的海洋物理學。</p>
<p>美國在大西洋岸的島茲霍爾有臨海實騐所與產實騐所的建築物。</p>
<p>至於日本的臨海實騐所，大概附屬於各帝國大東北帝大在靑森縣的淺蟲與宮城縣的女川，東大在神奈川縣的三崎，京都帝大在和歌山縣的瀨戶，九大在熊本縣的富岡，名古屋帝大在三重縣的管島，東京父理大在廣島縣的向島，各有實騐所。此外在靜岡縣的下由有三井海洋研究所。</p>
<p>這些實騐所的研究各有其特微。茲以東京文理科大學的實騐所為例，介紹其研究情形。</p>
<p>東京文理天的下田臨海實騐所，在伊豆下田町郊外鍋田灣。這實騐所與別所不同者，除海產生物學之外，兼研究地球物理學及海洋地理學。這裏除各種研究室外？有一般公開的水族館，採集標本的陳列室，並備有海的研究上不能缺的採集觀測用的船。</p>
<p>實騐所的研究，第一應處理其附近海的性狀。在下田實騐所，迄現在止，每月二次，決定日期，選擇近海一定的塲所，調查海水之物理化學的性狀。這通常稱為海軍調查，或海洋觀測。這調查觀測研究些什麼呢呢？因其涉及多方面，其洋不能細述，試舉一例，則為水溫鹽分量。</p>
<p>下田實騐所附近的水溫，大受南方來的黑潮的影響而起變化，但這也因與附近的氣溫有重大的變化。又關於海水的鹽分量，在實騐所附近，因沒有大的河川，殆無淡水的流入，是以鹽分量先不會低落。但因雨量的多少，沿岸地方或許較薄。然而祗要略冲合在一起，就不受影響，影響所及者，祗有黑潮。</p>
<p>目前下田實騐所的研究，以生物學方面爲主。生物的起源，有人甚至於說是海洋，可是海中究竟有許多生物樓息着。這些生物自然從各方面加以研究，但首先是浮流生物的研究。浮流生物者，大家都知道，是浮流於海水中的微小生物，種類繁多。用特種的網採集。此在知這海的性狀上，是極重要的生物。例如，海流衝撞到淺瀨時，本來上層的東西就變成中層的，或下層的。然而各層中有各層特有的浮流生物，近到之後，可以知道海水流動的轉變。又浮流生物亦因水溫等而變化。且這是魚類的海物，在水產上也盡了重要的任務。</p>
<p>實騐所除這浮流生物外，並用底曳採集器捕捉各種生物，研究近海的生物相。且不僅是這些生物之分類學的方面，並也詳細地實騐的觀察生體的性狀。例如切取　集於海藻中的孑孑體之一部分，再研究新生出來的部分的壯况。或切取生體的一部移植於別的個體，研究其發</p>
<p>更說到生理，生化學方面，研究只類和　　等的消化器官，及消化液的性質。這些有與我們人類性質上相同者，也有不同者，總之實騐所研究的，一一敘述起來，一時也說不完，留待下次有機會時再說吧？</p>
<p>由上所述，火家想巳約略知道臨海實騐所所研究的什麼？最後，筆者想一說臨海實騐所的研究有何意義？換言之，何以臨海實騐所有其必要。</p>
<p>如就學術而言，如上所述，一面研究海之物理化學的性狀，一而研究生活於海上的生物體之詳細。但大家都知道，所謂學問者，決不止此。乃是制空，或利用海。如欲利用海，先須澈底理解海的情狀。不如比，不能十二分無從知道利用海的方法。因此，學問是必要的。</p>
<p>如我國四面環海的海洋國，更不能不更推進地海的研究。賴忠勇將士艱苦奮鬥所奠定的大東亞海，應每一個角落都加以研究，自然科學上我們也不能不抓住新權。這是我們的任務。（作者係下由臨海實騐所所長）（翔譯）</p>
<h3 id="c46">日本少年的海洋訓練　—神奈川縣福浦少年團的一日— <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>驚濤拍岸的吼聲震盪着淸晨的空氣。在最光曦微中，巨大的岩石彷彿島黑的牛，　在洶湧澎湃的海面。東方，朝雲泛着自巴。漁火點點，忽明忽減。夜色慢慢淡消。</p>
<p>白色的帳幕內，數十多團員此時尚在淸新的火氣中酣眠未醒。</p>
<p>淸晨四時，起床的號聲傳遍了沈靜的地表，一直傳向遙遠的海上。剎那問，從營帳中湧出一羣小竹筴魚似的健壯少年。</p>
<p>班長點過名以後，大家都裸體向天色尚末大明的海默默走去，沒有一個人講話，空氣非常嚴肅。頭上，明星霎着亮眼。這學少年，一齊向天地誦祗祈禱大東亞戰爭的大捷。以後，便開始一日的功課</p>
<p>一學習海，知道海，以海作舞台…」他們高聲齊唱自己的使命，默念爲何完成大東亞的偉業，鍛練着身心。</p>
<p>「划船訓練！自第一號舟起，集合港夕！向南</p>
<p>滌除身心的汚穢以後，再做用力氣的事情，眞是無上的樂事！打着班旗的小舟，相繼浮行水上。水平綫上，隱約可以望見大島。</p>
<p>「十分鐘全速！方向自由。開始！」號令一下，吆喝聲便作，大家一齊用力划。平靜的海面上，船頭蹴起了白浪，槳聲款乃。未來的海上勇士們，將全身力量運在足尖腰跨及兩臂上，盡力地划，宛爲上戰塲，一心一意在黎明的海上疾駛。</p>
<p>「訓練停止！」</p>
<p>不禁齊呼萬幾。兩平全是汗。團員們心領着海上淸晨的爽快味道，各尋歸路。浦途，各人隨童垂着釣絲，釣取梭魚。每條小船中，都可看見跳着銀着的銀色梭魚。</p>
<p>營幕中大概預備好了早餐吧。大家的肚子都感到空處，所以趕快划回去，狼吞虎嚥地大吃大嚼，有人竟把剛剛釣來的梭魚佐餐。</p>
<p>海的知識</p>
<p>上午七時起，上的功課是學科方面的。可以聽到關於海的種種知識。今日講的是南方魚類的標本，先生很熱心地講解。啊，南字是多麼可親哪！南方並不遠，是我們力所能及的地方。</p>
<p>午前八點三十分，開始實習。實習隨時而異，有時是捕魚，有時是做工，有時是航海……花色很多，不勝枚舉。今日的實習則是測定水溫。在陸上聽聆命令，並在海圖上說明進路和測定等。圓規在孤圖上活躍。之後，各自攜着用貝，跑到船上去。</p>
<p>「目標眞鶴崎的先端，」</p>
<p>「水溫測定第二號地點。」</p>
<p>「測定準備！」</p>
<p>號令聲在海上廻　着</p>
<p>團員們各將測定了的事項記載起來，並且作成表格。蔚藍的海水中，浮着白色的水母。但是一想到祖先的血曾經染紅了此海，無論那一個的臉都緊張起來了。</p>
<p>島黑的身體連夏天的日光也無所肆其虐。至於流一身汗，那又有什麼關係呢？提起來的用具的底上，黏着一片海藻。這是多麼縈人胸懷呀！</p>
<p>「第三號地點二十八米，水溫二十二度半。」報吿的聲音漸漸遠了。</p>
<p>十時三十分，接到本部發來的訓練終了的通信，於是紛紛歸港。當大家各白整理用具，選定到着地點，做完各人的事情時，船也到了岸。</p>
<p>「上陸準備，」</p>
<p>「開始淸掃。」</p>
<p>全體團員將起卸上岸的小船描除。他們仔細揩抹，小心修補，要將它們弄得比敎室更好有。即使是一塊木板，也不放鬆。</p>
<p>在樹陰下，打開海圖和表格，將這次測定的深度及溫度塡寫上去。不但記明上中下各層的溫度，並且註明測流及海水的狀况。從前傳說的事情，這樣一來，也別具一種意義了。在很大的圖上書學這次所獲的結果時，已時午餐時分了。</p>
<p>午餐是站着吃的。這因為洋上很多一邊工作一是乞飯的塲合，所以要訓練他們不論何時何地都能自由。在地吃飯。起初的時候，這似乎很難，不過不久就能自由自在地吃了。</p>
<p>餐後打兩小時的休息。各人拿條毯子任意選擇適當的樹陰去睡午覺。太平洋的海風吹拂着全身，靜靜地閉着眼，上午的猛烈訓練此時便像是夢中的事情。</p>
<p>樹陰裏，輕聲高唱，海水的反光閃閃。四肢　便地伸展，身體彷彿在大起來。多有趣哪，這樣的感覺！</p>
<p>游泳訓練</p>
<p>下午兩點鐘，喇叭聲又起，立刻開始受游泳訓練。個人的游泳法在少年團中是不敎的，現在所敎授的祇是「羣游」及水中作業。各班各成一隊，班長游在前頭。而且，在這種訓練中，必須忍受困難，非但不許哭，並且不准喊乞力。</p>
<p>「一小時遠游開始！」</p>
<p>各隊一同跳入海中，默然無言地游着。眯着眼睛，劃着手足。游呀游的，漸漸游得　軟手酸。有時，嗇魚飛出海面，樣子眞有趣。岸上的帳蓬漸小，屋頂上的字也看不淸楚了。這樣游了約一個鐘頭，方才歸港。大家精神十足地唱着「我是海之子」，踏上歸途。不論在瓜達爾卡　爾或所羅門羣島，都是這種力量這種意氣的表現哪！火島之上。浮着式樣詭計奇的一大片雲，</p>
<p>三點半鐘，開始游泳訓練的講評。大家聚集在岩石上，一邊眺望着剛在游過的水路，一邊靜聆種種說明。潮是怎麼樣，風是怎麼樣，在先生的訓解下，反省到自己的動作時，也有不覺苦笑起來的。聽到看見海風而大吃一驚的話，更不禁大笑起來。</p>
<p>晚間作業</p>
<p>下午四時起，全體從事準備晚餐。各班分別研究如何將海中的　物燒成菜備。處理海藻的小組，烹調小魚的小組。燒製海螺的小組，紛紛苦幹，在不馴習的手下燒成了各式各樣的食物。海中可食之物極多，準備獻身海上的人必須努力隨時隨地加以利用。大東亞的四至極廣，應該受種種的訓練才行</p>
<p>食後，聽取對於晚餐的批評。有人聽到別人批評他燒的東西不好吃，便不服氣地說，「我媽也是這樣燒的！」</p>
<p>總之，他們的烹調確有好壞，但爲國家而努力的樣子，總是可敬可佩的</p>
<p>夜問，或作摩爾斯光綫信號的練習，或作夜釣，或行水產動物的調查一，也有在蓬帳內　着班長從事海圖的計算，或研究由星辰辨別方位的。</p>
<p>這樣，到了晚上八點　，訓練終了的號聲響了起來，火家便預備睡覺。在每個帳幕裏，都可看見太陽晒黑的險。這個臉孔，這個身體，就是日本的力量。海岸漸漸隱入夜之黑幕中，在波浪拍岸的聲音中，夾着一些不知什麼虫的嗚聲。</p>
<p>知道大海，並且生活於海上人，前途是遠人的。由這樣整齊統一有嚴格訓練，才可正確地知道海，才可以在海上活躍。海的防產，海的產業，相携相扶，才能完成十分的成績，所以必須如此努力才對。（掬川廣照）譯自海洋少年第五五十三號）</p>

<p>自加蕯勃朗卡會議以至今日來，我們的太平洋的正面敵人美國，因其國內情形及對重慶，澳洲等諸太平洋關係國的慾念，決不將太平洋戰綫置之度外。故太平洋方面，呼應歐洲第二戰綫，最近將有何種積極的反攻舉動。早在我們的意料之中。果然，美國竟企圖正面來叩我內南洋的大門，馬利亞納羣島中的賽班島，並空襲日工業地帶北九州。</p>
<p>不用說，反軸心方面這種焦躁的作戰，不過是以其物資之量爲靠山的血氣之勇。然而世界戰局，因此而突入決戰期，則是我們應得正視的。際此嚴重戰局，一億人民應不慌不忙，以堅定的決心，向戰爭的職域邁進。茍能如此，則敵的潰滅，指日可待。</p>

<p>— 儀宣</p>
<p>每次訪琴，總承她留住晚餐，今晚又不能例外；我們坐在窗邊，迎受着黨人的初廈的微風，燈上垂下了黑布罩，除了桌面中央，有些亮光外，四周都暗沉沉地。</p>
<p>琴在碧玉似的小杯中，斟滿了淸澄的玫瑰酒，向我舉杯道：「飲吧！這一杯祝你靑春永駐！」我深深的呷了一口，這話在我聽來，似乎充滿了哀傷，誰能留得住飛奔的歲月呢！</p>
<p>離開中學，僅祇二年，人事的變幻，簡直不堪設想；者日的歡樂，都成了今日的感嘆；尤其在這酒後，更易促起對故人的懷念；懷念一起，我們不約而同的互問：「不知玫近况如何」？</p>
<p>「人生不相見，動如參與商，」琴感慨着，一聲長嘆後，我浸入了沉默的回憶中。</p>
<p>攻，那個矮胖身材，快樂的姑娘，生着一張討人喜歡的圓臉；她就考進大學，專攻經濟。起初，在每月一次的聚會裏，她的像熱蘋菓似的兩頰上，都依舊泛着天眞的笑容，說話也仍是那　頑皮率直；但在次年暑假還本開始前，她有些變了；她時常失約，我們責問她時，她常　紅了臉，含糊的說着不通貫的理由；不久，我們也由責問易爲打趣，「玫有了愛人！」道消息就傳播得比閃電選要快。</p>
<p>秘密旣已公開，於是她在較為接近的琴和我之前，就時常談起他；一提到洪，她的圓臉就變得更甜蜜，更可愛了！</p>
<p>在我們的目光中，洪只是一個平庸的人，身軀　小，相貌不揚，並且滿臉丙容，但是很會說話；因此涉世未深的玫，竟熱成也愛上了也。</p>
<p>漸漸的，次一又　日的嬌態，變得很呆滯；臉土消失了甜美笑，眼中似乎藏着隱憂；我們關心地探問她，她只是苦笑不語。</p>
<p>去冬，在我生日的晚上，泗酣耳熱後，她倒底吐出了她的不幸：原來洪已使君有婦，還有兩個孩子；玫也會見過他的妻子，是一個賢慧的女人。</p>
<p>我們都覺得這事很容易解決，同聲勸她懸崖勒馬，砍斷情絲；誰料她却苦痛地說：「要毀滅已成長的愛情，不是一件容易的事」。</p>
<p>「那末你們不能如朋友般相愛嗎」？我說得很隨便。「我也這樣打算」，她低語着。</p>
<p>琴的年齡稍長，人情世故，懂得比我們透澈；這時，她很嚴重地說道：</p>
<p>「眉，你還是和他疏遠的好；你還年靑，你沒有控制自己情緒的力量；何况你們已有了超乎友誼的感情。跨入了情網，就如陷足於泥，越踏越深；並且在兩個異性靑年間，很難維持純潔的友誼，尤其像你們；橫在面前的路，祗有兩條，一是疏遠，一是愈形密切，攻！妥常些，你還是揀前一條路，你不能再接捉他，否則祗有使你痛苦」。</p>
<p>我仔細思索，也覺得這話很對；因此我們共同勸導她，和她詳述利害，整整一夜的時間，她被我們說動了心。自此，她果然和他很冷淡，可是她的內心也苦悶非凡。我們每人找她玩，替她解悶，而總不能振奮她的訓神容。</p>
<p>寒假開始，洪不時來耀她去去，她都忍痛拘絕；他又接連寫來盡是甜言蜜語的信，玫每一次哭看讀它們。終於，開學後，舊情復燃，他們是比前更親曜了；為了一時的激情，她竟甘自陷入了萬刦不</p>
<p>琴幾次驚惕她：「玫切莫和自己的命運打賭！」但是她竟然說；「你們不懂得得愛，你們不了解我。」</p>
<p>「在情慾的衝動下，決不會產生眞正的愛情。」我相信琴的話，然而玫是憎厭了、於是她不再見我們，我們也不忍看她扮演悲劇的主角。</p>
<p>「酒入愁腸，化作想思淚；」誰說酒能解憂又是「一盞能消萬古愁」呢</p>
<p>飯罷辭出，天下着細雨，我堅拒了琴的携留，帶着酒意，緩步冒雨歸家德不能安民；街上　來了賣唱者的歌聲，妻婉得猶如棄婦哀訴，我為之更覺　然。</p>
<p>突然，大門上起了剝啄聲：「篤為……」誰啊？我開實下望「是我」一。啊！玫來了！我急忙忙下去開門，把她迎入房中；燈光下，她的臉容很憔悴，濕髮凌亂的垂在額上；在這初夏的天，她還穿着長大衣，但是也掩不住她的微隆的腹部。</p>
<p>她略帶羞澀，俯視着地面問道：「可能讓我住一晚嗎」。「可以。」我沈吟了一會：「是和家裏衝突了嗎。」</p>
<p>「不，我早己離開家了。」「那麼……」我不知道怎樣說我心中要說的</p>
<p>「事已至此，我也顧不得你們訕笑，一失足成千古恨，我鑄成大錯了！」她終至嗚咽：「我們己同居數月，最初他答應和他妻子離婚，後來一再一推諉，今晚竟說了許多不負責任的話我惱極，和他爭吵了一塲，就跑了出來；在這深夜，我無處可去，只得來找你。」</p>
<p>「那末將來你預備怎樣呢」。</p>
<p>「我己到了絕路，他不肯和也妻子婚，找也不願作妾；我旣然毀減了自已的幸福，就案性把生命也毀減了吧」！「不能！不能！攻！你不能這樣」。我眞希望琴在這裏，幫助我安慰她，鼓勵她，我的口齒太笨拙了。</p>
<p>她無語暗抺淚痕，房中是死　寂寥，一隻飛蛾，繞燈亂撲；我討厭它的騷擾，揮手趕它出去，瞬息，它又進來了。我諦視着，不禁默語：「盲目的追求着無價値的愛情，不正如這撲火的蛾；也許它能得到一時接近光明的快感，但是它將因此喪生，運帶失去了享受眞正的光明的機會」。</p>
<p>一晚就這麼靜默地過去。雖然現在她是接受了琴的指示，安心待產，再謀善策；可是我們仍時刻爲她擔憂，怕她脆弱的心，經不起打擊，而再來一次錯誤。</p>
<p>寄語玫：永遠埋葬了過去的錯誤，苦海無邊，回頭是岸。你已作了愛情的犧牲者，莫再使洪的妻子和孩子，也無辜的爲你的錯誤而犧牲，不要把戀愛當作你的永久歸宿，它只是你整個生命史上的一小段記載而已！</p>
<h3 id="c49">阿根和趙先生 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 中岬</p>
<p>為了禮尙往來，人們買着東西作爲饋贈</p>
<p>前年父親買了禮物去很珍貴的啦！大概還欠珍貴些，可是在父親，這已是很了不起了，或許趙先生正在不快着，那樣不値錢的東西，竟然也算了他收到的禮物之一，或許甚至會把它向地上一摔，出些氣。</p>
<p>父親整天悶悶，沒有笑容地躺在睡　上。</p>
<p>下午工匠阿根跑來找父親，向父親借錢，我望見阿根的笑臉，虛心下氣這像的談判　　了好久，少數目我看不淸楚，可但斷定不多的，他裝着笑，　倒他的身體，行着禮，父親趕蒼蠅般向他揮着扇。</p>
<p>我望見他跨出了門口，在門外數鈔票，我對着他的影子，起了一種莫名的感慨似底情緒，被一時的衝動，我呌住了他。。</p>
<p>「阿根！」他慌忙地回轉頭來。</p>
<p>「囑！少益！什麼？</p>
<p>什麼事？」他又裝起了笑臉問。</p>
<p>「爸呌我把這些也給你！」</p>
<p>「雖！　！少爺！…這，…喔！謝謝！…謝謝！謝謝！謝謝少爺！謝謝</p>
<p>「爸說這些送給你做本錢，賺了時還得出便還，還不出也就罷了。」</p>
<p>「嗄！嗄！…嗄！嗄！…是的！是的…謝謝老爺！…謝謝老爺！…老爺質是！…眞是！…」他眞誠的感激，給了我心頭無限安慰，安慰着我，雖然我一整年的享樂，從此消失掉，球賽電影之類。但是我竭力地使自己開心，我可以和同學奕棋，可以讀讀世界名着，那忠厚老實的阿根，該在怎樣地感恩呢？後來他遇見我時，常問起父親的健康，我回答他，父親健康着。</p>
<p>「謝謝天！謝謝天！」他這樣說。　　暑假裏，父親買了一對可愛的小兎，那是玳瑁色的小東西，有趣的鼻子，好玩的耳朶，和牠那不停　動的鼻嘴，無論一動一跳都可愛，就給靑菜蘿蔔牠吃，牠很快地生長着。</p>
<p>我們都愛護牠，關心牠，並且希望牠生小兔。</p>
<p>兎的肚子大了，最先發現的是小弟弟，他尖呌起來：</p>
<p>「媽媽！哥哥！兎的肚子大了！兎的肚子大了！」</p>
<p>為這，兩個弟弟爭論着，「究竟有沒有要生小兔呢？「後來牠的肚子一天一天地膨大了，終於生下了四個小兔來。</p>
<p>生小兎後，大兎脫了些毛，我們更加愛護着牠，我每天自學校回來，最先來看她，撫弄牠，有了空課，也回來看牠一次。</p>
<p>那天的空課，我又跑了回來，看見阿根驚奇而又喜悅地蹲在兔罷前為餵牠，「很好玩的是吧？阿根！一我說。</p>
<p>「喔！少爺！，是的，…少爺！你這麼早就放學啦？…這，少爺！你用得研嗎？…這，…少爺？…」他送給我一支紅色的關勒銘鋼筆。</p>
<p>「阿根！你送給我嗎？不要這樣！阿根！這你算什麼？下次不要買來！」</p>
<p>「喔！喔！少爺！是，是……」他又陪上了笑臉，「……老爺還沒有來嗎？…」</p>
<p>「還沒有！…阿根！你拿回去！……唔！放着吧，下次別再！…」</p>
<p>「下次不！下次不！」</p>
<p>從此之後，阿根有了空也常常進來逗引小兎了</p>
<p>星期日，我生着病，頭非常暈，父親在辦宴會，來的都是趙先生之類，同了他們的姨太太們，宴會當然是等得很遲才開始的，在筵席間他們文雅地討論書畫，女人們吃吃地笑着，別的我就不知道了。</p>
<p>星期日過掉後，宴會二沒有什麼了，可是兎子却又生了四個。</p>
<p>不久，免籠就顯得太小了，兎子們滿籠爬着，碰着，擠着，尿屎的異臭，很不好聞，母親主張送掉些，自己只留兩個大兔兩個小兔，其餘都送掉。</p>
<p>我們討論着送給誰的問題！</p>
<p>「二個給趙家！二個給錢家！那麼還有二個呢？」</p>
<p>「我想：」父親說，「也給了趙家吧！趙太太一定很歡喜地，那天不是嗎？」</p>
<p>於是兔就送掉了。</p>
<p>第二天阿根就送掉了。</p>
<p>「咦！少爺！兔兒呢只剩下這幾個了？」</p>
<p>「都送掉了！」我說</p>
<p>「送掉啦？」他惋惜地說着。但又加了一句：「那好的！」</p>
<p>「哈！哈！好什麼？你也很數喜牠的是嗎？下次我呌給你也留一對吧！哈哈！……」</p>
<p>「哈哈…少爺！謝謝！謝謝！…老爺還沒有來？…吟哈！…」</p>
<p>在全家反對之下，我堅持着給阿根一對，終於阿根得到了一對，阿根終於得到了一對，—最不美麗。並且都是雄的，他小心地用衣服兜着去。</p>
<p>後來的，知道趙家的兔，就在送去的第二天，死於玩弄，別的大都死了，我家的二對，因父親失業，都沒有心思去弄牠，也死了，只有阿根的一對，到現在還是活潑淸潔，而且可愛，也只有阿根，還時時問起父親的健康，可慘地，趙先生在栽員時却選中了父親。</p>
<p>雖然這已是三年前的事了，可是我還淸楚地記住牠，並且要一直的記住牠！</p>

<p>— 可鹿</p>
<p>賣麵包的穿過了大街，走完了小巷；高高地尖尖地很細嫩的嗓子喊出了一聲：「要哦—吃格熱格麵包！」</p>
<p>夕陽才落，孩子們已三三二二呼兄道弟地招呼着買麵包去了。黃錯翩臨時街道上已　起呌賣的喊聲，繼續着直到更深人靜。</p>
<p>暈黃的燈圈裏，依稀看見短小蹣跚的身影隨在夜行人後面，過去了一個又一個；盛麵包的籃子究竟太沉重了，孩子們不得不時時放下籃子，微喘中仍勉力地呌喊着。雖然身子疲乏得很，肚子也覺得餓了，但眼看着籃子裏的麵包，祗能向肚子裏嚥一口淸水，拎起了籃子重往前走。</p>
<p>冷靜之巷不敢呌喊去，熱鬧塲所供過於求，孩子們又不敢呌賣得離家過遠；徘徊，徘徊，就儘在附近徘徊。</p>
<p>弄底，巷尾，踏着月的碎影，小喉嚨裏尖尖地一聲呌賣，叩遍了每家住戶的窗子。間或有一家二家開着露出頭來：</p>
<p>「麵包熱哦？」</p>
<p>「麵包熱格！要幾隻。」照例地回答。</p>
<p>做完了一筆交易，小心地放妥了錢，重新又瞪起含有三分恐懼四分愁的小眼睛，拎起了籃子，又骨溜溜地四面去探索顧客了。</p>
<p>是生活，把孩子天眞的童心蹂得粉碎；而今，他們不再夜遊神似地遙逍自在了，為着活命，負起了生活的重担。</p>

<p>— 紀恂</p>
<p>……「焦不感覺奇怪嗎？」她頭一仰隨口就噴出一口烟，像是對自己嘲笑，也像是對這堅個世界的嘲笑。</p>
<p>「說起來眞是慚愧、自己雖不是閉秀身份，却也念過了幾年書，程度說不好，但高中是學了業的。家庭也可說是衣食無憂，然而偏　我會做舞女，您說這是中國敎育的失敗也好，自己的甘習下流不長進也好，但這是一個事實，斗個慘　的事實！」…………</p>
<p>……「如要說我怎樣從家庭中出來，以致於做了舞女，想必您很要知道詳怕吧；因為其中充滿　　曼　克的曰氣息理！」</p>
<p>「在我高中畢業的那年，父親用「女大當嫁」的題目，要我出嫁，本來出嫁也是好事，　得爸爸好心，替我我得一個很有錢的男人，但他的年紀呢？却老得正好做我的爸爸。」</p>
<p>「當然我不能嫁這樣的一個人，於是我就反對，女兒反對父親作上的婚姻，在上海是很普遍的，但在我們家鄕是沒有的事情在高壓下，結果是可想而知的，我祗有兩條路可走，不是自殺，就是脫離家庭；可是我怎能死呢！因為對於生，是無論　都是留　的，俗語說得好「螞蟻尚且貪生。」所以我就挑坊二絛路走了。」……</p>
<p>……「是的，您在點頭表示讚許了，我對於　愛神聖的認眞，是誰就要感動的吧！」</p>
<p>「然而，脫離了家庭又怎樣呢？滿以為自己是中學畢業生，要在社會中謀個八的飯碗總不難吧；但在上海住了兩個月，帶出來的錢倒用得差不，了。事情則　無成就，敎育使我知道了，人生的意義，但不曾使我有生活的本領，做女僕都要有保人才行的，因此我連女僕的資格都挨不到。「眞到了絕路了，有辦法？哦！如果眞是絕路，今天我也不會同您在這裏淡這許多話了，激幸「天無絕八之路」方在飢餓和寒冷綫上徘徊的時候，有人給我個機會，一個用最原始的方式去出于　自已的機會，就是出賣色相，做舞女的　會。」…………</p>
<p>……「途窮末路時，我自然也接受了這機會，為什麼不呢？有勸我不要去的，我感謝他們的好心，但他們却是連什麼呌飢餓也不知道的呀！」</p>
<p>「由於容貌長得還不錯，對男子的心理再略加揣摩，覺得男子都是非常容易操縱的。」</p>
<p>「…………」我禁不住微微的笑了。</p>
<p>「您不用否認連您也在內的，總之我靠着手段的巧妙和容貌的美麗，我做得很順利。要衣有衣，要吃有吃，我再也不怕冷和餓，不但如此，我並且紅了起來，對生活我有無上的享受，雖有人批評我生活的不嚴肅，生活的淫靡，我却不否認，因為我的確如此，我學會了揮霍，我向生命預支，儘可能的求享受。…………」</p>
<p>「因為舞塲裏只是五年一世的！您幾曾有見半老的紅舞女呢！我常想，舞女像春天裏的花一探，化謝了就沒有人要了。」</p>
<p>「因此幾個月來，我想着一個以前從沒有想過的問題，就是自巳的歸宿問題。</p>
<p>「您可算是我在風月塲中所認識的惟一朋友，我自然是講老實話了，幾年來認識的舞客眞不少，如果嫁年輕的呢？自然多得很，但是我祗能開他們談愛，却不能嫁給他們，因為他們大都是沒有錢的。」</p>
<p>「環境是怕的是不是？您知道錢越多，像是越不够花呷！現在正有一個上了年紀的人在追求我，哦！不是追求，而是對我發生了與趣，他有很多的錢，我眞不知道他怎樣會積緊起這許多的錢。」</p>
<p>「他像對商品一樣的對我發生了興趣，我也像奇貨可居的開了似錢。」…………</p>
<p>「您不要不滿，錢是萬能的，我想我現在另另碎碎的出賣色相，如果他能給我金錢上的滿足，為什麼不能整個的賣給他呢，雖然年紀相差到三十歲。」</p>
<p>「人生本來是充滿着循環的矛盾呀！試想如果我現在眞的為了錢而嫁給一個老頭，我當時又何必要脫離家庭呢！」……</p>
<p>「白白地在社會上去遭一遭，多一番苦辣的體騐，但也推翻了從前的人生觀，社會是一個大染缸；人生本是循環不斷的矛盾的有機體呀！」我呢？仍舊是　　無言。</p>

<h3 id="c52">優勝劣敗天演公例　排球聯賽强弱已明　對於裁判有一見議 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>排球聯賽開始以來，雖僅兩週。唯甲組女組隊伍較少，且以蘇聯隊之隱退，故至目下强弱巳分，端倪已有，形勢已定。茲承上期光略依次叙各塲戰情，再作甲組女組之形勢談。</p>
<p>志騫揚威　華嚴敗退</p>
<p>上週五（十四日）有女子一塲，（甲組蘇聯退出，故對俄僑甲之戰取消。）志驚首逢華嚴，後者為極有布望之隊伍。唯此戰似嫖生疏，進攻得分之朱文佩張燮月兩人，均失誤多於成功。以故志騫隊得暢所欲為，以二對〇凈獲勝利。觀志　表演，確較華邊時代，進步良多，尤以張嘉歲祝士芳之老當益壯，翁瀾淸徐蔚之年少有為，最有顯著之表演。所以得唱旋歌者，亦有賴於此四將之努力也。</p>
<p>粵華進步　輕取俄乙</p>
<p>本選一（十七日）僅塲，（女子蘇聯退出，故與綠隊之之役，無從舉行。）粵華第二度出馬，共演出較戰華影時，進步殊多。而麥炳堯之臨陣，進攻方面，有一集中之供給者，得能循例攻擊，為取勝之大關鍵。而三排黃耀華余郇鄭士常之屢救險球，博得堂聲不少。俄僑乙曾擊退白隊，球　相常可觀，依諾夫之扣球，兇狠之至。惜乎全隊一臨大敵，便呈慌亂，乃不免慘敗。粵華始終謹愼應付，以直落三連勝。</p>
<p>志騫勝西靑紅俄僑甲破華影</p>
<p>週三（十九日）有女子及甲組各一塲。首塲女子志騫鬥西靑紅，前者羣策羣力，二對〇壓倒番女，代華達在西靑聯賽之仇得以償矣。緣西靑紅實存不慣遠東規則之吃點，彼此時有推讓或互奪之事，志騫隊近狀殊好，蓋有名師指示。每日夕陽西下時，均在上海女中球塲埋頭苦練，有此成績，豈偶然哉。</p>
<p>甲組俄僑甲以七人應戰，竟爾殺得華影隊片甲不留，而第二局中俄甲以二十一—一之絕大相差數取勝，賽出我人意料。華影隊人材旣不平均，練習又少，安得不敗。此戰中譚永湛，非但用武乏術，抑且錯誤百出，亦大失常態。俄甲雖七人，但七人伹能有猛烈之開球，兇惡之劈殺和猛扣，勝來似甚輕易。</p>
<p>觀目下形勢，甲組唯俄甲與粵華是爭，女組則成綠隊志騫三省三角對峙之局面。日後劇戰及奪很錦標不外此數隊矣。</p>
<p>甲組形勢兩强爭覇甲</p>
<p>組中保持不敗者，為勢華俄僑甲兩强，實力上亦以此兩隊為雄厚。以現况而論，當以俄僑甲取有奪標可能，其全隊之開球有力，已足使敵隊寒膽。尤以羅特契夫如砲彈式之急球。戰華影隊奇制勝，亦極可能。夫俄四盎大刀闊斧之能事，粵華　柔並施，相逢時如能用於智者多於用力，碧眼兒，或將莫展其才，着令隊以為何如？</p>
<p>女組已成三角對峙</p>
<p>女子組中華嚴西靑紅均有敗績，唯華隊三强，保持常勝紀錄，賽前亦早料必成此三角對峙形勢。按三隊各在鈎心鬥角，延聘各師。三省有劉荷生，志　為朱譚兩君，綠隊為旭滄。照記者視察，三省攻勝於守，志騫攻術較為新穎而多變化，綠隊則攻守雖無特出，而極平均衡。故嗣後得失，難作預測評論。况女子之演出，頗有變幻，順逆莫定。遇大敵時，更有顯著之心理變態。成敗基於此者，固未必遜於其本領也。一言以蔽之，三省苦幹年餘，理屬應得，志騫隊各方面煞費心機，不應辜負。叭綠隊排球方面，倉卒於本屆成軍，初無必得之野心也。</p>
<p>規則並無明文裁判從何限制</p>
<p>最後記者對於發球時，裁判於發球時跳躍之限制焚嚴，不禁發生感想焉</p>
<p>按排球比賽發球者，要施展猛烈之臂力，使球過網，極易跳躍，然裁判予以限制。記者曾詡遍排球規則，並無此項規定，不識此限制究由何人創議，而傳傳至今者。茲錄排球規則中比賽規則關於發球之第二條於下。</p>
<p>「比賽開始時，應由發球之一隊中發球次序之第一人。將球用隻手（張開或握緊）從綱士發入對區，發球時球員之變足，應立於端綫之後，（即較端綫　綱為遠之處）而介於兩邊之引長綫間，自預備發球時至球擊着時止，綫足不得越過端綫。」</p>
<p>規則所裁，如此而己，僅不得越過端綫，跳躍不一定會越遠端綫。故目下裁判不識有何根據？或者以誤纏誤？記者極願裁判之錯，如屬於後者，則尚希即予以更正，以後比賽中立即無此項限制之規定。再進一步而　，排鐵運動，不脫為一跳躍運動，如攔　扣殺，均須有高度跳躍，始克成功，何獨限於發球時之限制跳躥耶？盼裁判會方面，予我以答覆，或採納我　，實為幸甚！</p>

<p>全滬壘球聯賽開始已三週。華人勁旅熊猫隊（Pandas）於初次出戰以七比二大敗猶太隊。該隊本於前星期日與上屆冠軍「路斯坦奴」紅隊比賽，復因雨改期。觀衆因經本報介紹該華隊之實力，而往作壁上觀者，頗不乏人。後因改期均掃興而返。上星期日該隊又逢葡綠隊於膠州公園，華人觀者達數千人。是日比姿，熊猫隊又獲全勝，萄商隊全軍覆沒。成績為十二比二。</p>
<p>九人應戰</p>
<p>比賽時熊猫隊僅以九時應戰，（壘球隊共十人一隊），據領隊鄂森博士及敎練謂，該隊留日名游擊溫瑞雄，因事不克出塲，而捕手黃應瑞又因練習時右手手指被球削去忍痛出塲，因華隊該隊之另一捕手王秀山及後備梁有文又因病不能出戰，故只能以九人出塲。賽前在塲觀衆不論中西均認葡商必可獲勝，因該隊擁有備聯足球好手福恩及彼得遜昆仲等，彼等用手之敏捷及球藝並不輸於其脚，且擊球比熊猫隊佳。記者亦為華隊危也。熟知熊猫隊三軍甩命，努力出擊，致使葡商隊手忙脚亂，被華隊殺得片甲一不留。在塲華人均熱烈觀呼而拍手稱快。</p>
<p>戰程緊張</p>
<p>該賽戰程極度緊張。在第一局中，熊猫先攻，由二壘手盧兆森先擊得一壘打，繼之而捕手黃應瑞，一壘手王念祖均相維妙擊而上壘而成蒲壘（Fallbase）。此時葡隊在此危局下努鎭靜防手，第四位由留日名手梁有聲出擊，觀衆此時均望一全壘打（Home　run），以便在壘三人均可歸壘。梁君不負衆望，得拼命一聲，球直飛外圍。盧兆森及黃應瑞均歸壘獲二分，而梁君已偷至二壘矣。此時華隊無一被殺（Down）。繼而三壘手溫天華出擊，妙棒一揮，梁有聲及王念祖亦歸壘再獲二分。　之唐偉業及李啓　均高球被走出Out。此時華隊在最後機會下，輸至左翼勞權森出接而出。此第一局華隊得獲六分。至葡隊攻時，在華隊防守嚴密下，三上三落，無一上壘，徒手而返也。在第二局雙方均無所獲。第三局熊猫由王念祖得一分。而投手李啓勝犧牲用短棒誘敵擲一壘而使鍾保羅偷歸壘而得一分，更為難能可貴也。此局葡隊仍一無建樹，而華隊已八比零佔光。第四局盧兆森在奮不顧命之偷襲下而得一分，而葡隊則仍在嚴密防守下，　鬰不得志。至第五局時，華隊雖有出擊，但均被葡隊外翼所接。此時葡隊已漸見鋒芒。攻時，輪至卡美洛夫，一棒得一高球直飛中外翼（Center　field），華隊鍾保羅急步跳起緊接。鍾君姿勢美妙，博得掌聲不少。葡隊繼而勞勤士出擊，又一個聞出劈斧之姿勢，球有如飛彈直穿左外翼，誰知勞樹森不甘落後，一個鯉魚翻身球已緊接。此二球之失，葡隊實喊寃不止。蓋　一華隊漏接，即有全壘打（Home　run）而獲二分之希望。後葡隊由漢得生出擊，因熊貓捕手之錯誤得一二壘打。至足球名手彼得遜出擊時，又因膚兆森之慢擲，被漢得生歸壘而打破鴨蛋獲一分，第六局盧兆森再建一功，而葡隊又因一壘王念祖慢擲被偷歸壘而再得一分。至最後一局，葡隊大勢已去，仍拼死防守，卒被唐偉業及鍾保羅再得二分，而葡隊須奮力出擊，無奈在華隊之緊密鐵壁下，一無所獲也。</p>
<p>綜觀熊貓隊員，球　確屬上乘，但觀該隊之守實勝於攻。在此戰中，萄隊出擊個個球到棒到，且均為外翼之球，倘華隊之外翼稍差，即有大敗之處。而熊貓之所以勝，實一方面葡隊之游擊及投手之無能，他方面亦因華隊之守較勝一想，試觀在一二三四七　局中，葡隊均三上三落，即使有一壘打，亦逃不過二壘殺也。該賽論功行賞當以盧兆森之敏捷擊球。鍾保羅火車頭式之偷壘，每使葡隊連人帶球被鏟到。游擊梁有聲及三壘溫天韋之接　，實使葡隊難逃法綱。他如捕手黃應瑞及一壘王念祖均接球穩健。而尤足述者，乃華隊投手李啟勝之投球，峻急而有曲綫，且軟硬有道，每使葡隊大揮空棍也</p>
<p>總之熊貓隊倘刻苦猛練，將來得標，余敢斷言。不過該隊最好對擊球方面，再加訓練，因各員擊球技術不能平均，且不善攣全壘打，應多多練習之。否則若降「路斯坦奴」紅隊之湯拔拉（Tom　butler）之投球，恐不能抵抗矣。茲錄熊貓隊戰程於下：</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Chat on Local Administration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Attending the Symposium of the Local Administration Society</p>
<p>Since 1937, due to the war, local administration has long been absent from public view and unnoticed by the public. Many county magistrates come from special connections and cannot be talked about in terms of "administration," so the suffering of the people deepens day by day. However, practically speaking, the success of politics in the peace zone and the strengthening of the national government's position should all start with local administration. Some local administrators in this city, in conjunction with outstanding experts, publish a local administration monthly, whose task is to conduct research, criticism, or introduction to the principles, theories, and systems of local administration; to propose plans and schemes for local administration; to record administrative experiences; and to investigate communication and statistical materials. It is a relatively specialized publication in the peace zone and is much needed. Yesterday, at the symposium held by the society to entertain the standing members of the consultation committee, I was asked to express my views, so I offered the following:</p>
<p>We have said that central politics is a point, provincial politics is money, and county politics is a surface. The weakest link in the peace zone is the surface. The Minister of Interior, Mei Shiping, came to Shanghai last time, and I made a special trip to visit him on the morning of the 12th to discuss local administration. Mr. Mei is an expert with rich experience in local administration, having served as the model county magistrate of Jiangning for many years. I brought up old matters again and demanded that local administration be improved, hoping that important counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces would be selected to establish model local administrations. Mr. Mei replied that he was considering this issue in the suburbs of Nanjing and starting preparations. Although there would be no name of model counties, the reality of model county administration would be promoted. This is a very gratifying thing, and I hope it will become a reality soon.</p>
<p>We have long awaited Shanghai to become a national model political zone. I believe that Mayor Chen and Secretary-General Wu share this belief. Especially since the takeover of the concessions on August 1 last year, this belief has been strengthened. How can it be gradually realized? What are the manifestations? First, can a sound administrative system be established? Second, can personnel be improved to be refreshing? If the system can be improved, but the personnel cannot be improved, it is just a change of soup without changing the ingredients, and the above belief cannot be realized. The biggest difficulty in Chinese politics is the personnel issue. As for the establishment of government agencies, it is just to support officials and private individuals. Then, administrative agencies inevitably become bureaucratic agencies, just going around in circles with official documents and becoming document administration. Whoever as a superior official has the courage to break through the personnel difficulties will succeed. We firmly believe that Mayor Chen is very frank and sincere, does not use private individuals, and is inclusive of talents from all aspects. In order for Shanghai to become a model zone, we especially hope that before the merger of municipal organs on August 1 this year, a strict screening of the original personnel will be conducted to refresh the scene. This is the key to whether Shanghai's local administration can establish a model. We believe that most of the bureau and division chiefs of the municipal organs have ambitions to assist the mayor in building a new Shanghai. However, it is undeniable that there are still a few who cannot fulfill their duties, especially those who cannot fulfill their duties among the cadres of various bureaus and divisions. We hope to take this opportunity to give them a fair assessment. Of course, outstanding talents and excellent systems should be retained on the one hand.</p>
<p>Finally, my conclusion on the opinions at the symposium: First, I hope that the seven counties within the scope of Shanghai will all become model counties, and the county magistrates of each county are experts. This is the only way to change the bad environment in the suburbs of Shanghai and protect the security of Shanghai. I will prepare to make a suggestion at the next consultation meeting. At the same time, I hope that the experts of the Local Administration Society will participate in the work of building local administration. Second, although "Local Administration" is a monthly magazine, it is a good garden for absorbing and promoting people with aspirations for local administration. I hope it will gradually grow up and promote its opinions to be effective, so that model local administrations can be established everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Yingde, Break into Kowloon City, and Attack and Shoot Down Ten Planes Attacking Guangdong and Chongqing <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - Japanese elite troops are carrying out an encirclement and annihilation war against the Chongqing army in the mountainous areas of northern Guangdong Province, causing the Chongqing 7th War Zone army, which is stubbornly defending, to fall into chaos. The Japanese army crossed the Lianjiang River again, fiercely attacking the first two lines of defense of the Chongqing army in western Yingde along the mountain roads. On the 19th, they broke into Kowloon City and shelled the remaining Chongqing army in the mountainous area. The Chongqing 154th Division and the Independent 9th Brigade, which were stubbornly defending the area, have suffered heavy casualties. It is said that Yu Hanmou, commander of the Chongqing 7th War Zone, has sent reinforcements from Shaoguan to personally supervise the battle and do his best to defend Yingde. Currently, about five divisions of troops have been concentrated there. The Japanese are in high spirits and are still compressing the encirclement of the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>A base on the mainland, 20th (Central News Agency) - Around 2:00 PM on the 19th, more than 20 Chongqing aircraft of the P61 and P40 types invaded the area 40 kilometers west of Guangzhou in several teams. The Japanese aircraft teams engaged them in fierce air combat, shooting down four of them (one of which was not confirmed) and destroying six.</p>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese army on the front line in South China, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army occupied Qingyuan County, they urgently pursued the Chongqing army and headed north, bravely attacking a certain place. They are currently launching an annihilation operation centered on Datongxu. The comprehensive battle results determined by the 12th are as follows: 828 Chongqing soldiers were abandoned as corpses, 208 were captured, 4 flat-fire guns, 1 heavy machine gun, 1 mortar, 9 light machine guns, and many other guns and bullets were seized.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military authorities announced the battle situation on the night of the 19th, stating that the Japanese army in the Hengyang area had fiercely attacked various positions of the Chongqing army on the 18th. The gunfire of the Xincheng Street outside could be heard by the Chongqing garrison troops stationed in Hengyang City.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Generals Koiso and Yonai Receive Orders to Cooperate in Forming a New Cabinet; The Tojo Cabinet Resigns En Masse on the 18th <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese cabinet formation headquarters first announced at 8:55 PM on the 20th that Governor-General of Korea, Koiso, was summoned and entered the palace at 3:56 PM today. Today, General of the Army Koiso and Admiral of the Navy Yonai received the great order to cooperate in forming a cabinet.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Tojo cabinet resigned en masse on the 18th. The Japanese Situation Reporting Bureau has just announced the reasons for the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet as follows: Since the outbreak of the war, the government has closely cooperated with the General Headquarters and made various efforts to complete the war. At this critical decisive battle, the entire country is advancing to complete the war. The cabinet will resign en masse and believes that it should be handed over to a more powerful cabinet. Prime Minister Tojo prepared the resignation letters of all cabinet members and went to the palace on the morning of the 18th to pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor and report the purpose.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet, Chief Secretary Hoshino, Director General of the Information Bureau Amau, and Director of the Legislation Bureau Moriyama also submitted their resignations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The three key personnel of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Vice Minister Karasawa, Director of the Police Bureau Muramachi, and Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department Fujita, submitted their resignations to Minister of Home Affairs Ando after the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Senior Statesmen Hold a Meeting to Recommend the Most Suitable Candidate; Generals Koiso and Tojo Hold Important Talks <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - In order to cope with the current major war situation, refresh the people's hearts, and mobilize the total strength of the country to establish a foundation for completing the war, Prime Minister Tojo entered the palace at 11:40 AM on the same day and presented the resignation letters of the cabinet members to the Emperor. After Emperor of Japan inquired about the candidates for the succeeding cabinet from Minister Kido, he sought the opinions of various senior statesmen. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, a meeting of senior statesmen was held in the palace, gathering former prime ministers Baron Wakatsuki Reijiro, Admiral Okada Keisuke, Hirota Koki, Duke Konoe Fumimaro, Baron Hiranuma Kiichiro, General of the Army Abe Nobuyuki, Admiral of the Navy Yonai Mitsumasa, and former presidents of the Privy Council. They frankly expressed their opinions on the issue of organizing a succeeding cabinet under the current major situation. As a result of the discussion, it was considered that General of the Army Koiso Kuniaki, the governor-general of Korea, and Admiral of the Navy Yonai Mitsumasa were the most suitable candidates. They were granted an audience and presented three recommendations for General of the Army Koiso and Admiral of the Navy Yonai to succeed in organizing the cabinet. Therefore, the great order to be responsible for organizing the succeeding cabinet was bestowed upon General of the Army Koiso, the governor-general of Korea, and Admiral Yonai. Governor-General Koiso departed from Keijo at 11:15 AM on the 20th and arrived at Haneda Airport in Tokyo at 2:50 PM by plane. He and Admiral Yonai entered the palace to pay respects to the Emperor of Japan around 3:50 PM. They were granted an audience, and the two were ordered to organize the cabinet. Governor-General Koiso left after 5:50 PM and immediately went to the Prime Minister's official residence to visit Prime Minister Tojo and have important talks. He left at 6:45 PM. Admiral Yonai also left after reconvening the meeting of senior statesmen at 4:00 PM. The two cooperated, and in view of the severe progress of the war, they did not dare to delay and began the work of organizing a fresh and powerful cabinet as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Japanese People Expect a Powerful New Cabinet <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo's cabinet has been in power for two years and nine months. It was not until the 18th that he resigned en masse. The Greater East Asia War broke out in February of Prime Minister Tojo's cabinet. At that time, the Tojo cabinet worked hard to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere under the alliance between Japan, China, and Manchuria and the strong alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy. After receiving the declaration of war on December 8, Showa 16, in the spirit of Hakkō ichiu, in order to establish a foundation for permanent world peace, he destroyed the British and American bases of aggression in East Asia at lightning speed. Until today, he has always closely linked with the General Headquarters, pooling his wisdom and efforts, and advancing to establish a winning system. However, at that time, due to the pressure of the British and American ambition to dominate the world, he did not have enough time to fully prepare the domestic war system, and was involved in the vortex of the Greater East Asia War. This point was the most concerned by the Tojo cabinet. Therefore, after forming the cabinet, he quickly completed the system of all-out war in the country, hoping to exert all his strength and contribute to the holy war, so that he could establish today's wartime system. This kind of great achievement should not be ignored. However, recently, the Pacific war situation has reached a decisive stage, and the situation is more serious than before. At this time, the people of Japan are expecting more clear political measures, so Tojo and the cabinet members proposed resignation en masse. Although the resignation en masse of the Tojo cabinet was unexpected by the Japanese people, because the Japanese national polity is different from other countries in the world, this move will not cause a strong stimulus to the Japanese people. What the people of the whole country expect is the emergence of a more powerful and fresh cabinet.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - After General of the Army Koiso was ordered to come out and form a cabinet, Lieutenant General Sadao Ushijima, his classmate in the Army Military Academy, issued a statement on the matter as follows: I and Mr. Koiso were classmates in the Army Military Academy and the Army University. When I was a major, I served in the General Staff Headquarters with Mr. Koiso. Later, when I was an instructor at the Army University, Mr. Koiso was the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army. Therefore, I can be said to have been a lifelong friend with Mr. Koiso for half of my life. Although Mr. Koiso has a face that is frightening at first sight, on the other hand, he has a very careful personality. He has close consideration for everything. Therefore, among colleagues, he often holds more noble views than others. At the same time, he also holds the spirit of forceful action. In the future, he will serve as the prime minister of a country, and I believe that he will be the same as usual. He will boldly break through the raging waves and advance gradually in this major war situation. According to Mr. Koiso, when he was the commander of the Korean Army, he was called "The Tiger of Korea." What the world expects today is how this tiger will behave out of the cage. Mr. Koiso served as Vice Minister of the Army when he was an active soldier, Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Commander of the Korean Army, and when he was a reservist, he served as Minister of Colonial Affairs twice. Therefore, Mr. Koiso is indeed a general of forceful action.</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Normandy Campaign The Evolution is Worth Watching The German Army Has Withdrawn from the Ruins of San Luo <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German army on the Normandy front has announced that the German army has withdrawn from San Luo, and the anti-axis authorities have also stated that the British army has broken through the German positions in Caen, and the American army has cut off the highway between San Luo and Periye. As a result, the German army abandoned San Luo. This time, the word "breakthrough" was also used in Meng Gaomao Lai, which is still a pioneer. It can be seen that this operation is by no means limited to local operations. The air preparation attack is also more intense than in the past. In particular, the British Air Force bombers have begun to participate in daytime bombing. All of this is a manifestation of the anti-axis military's determination, so the evolution of future events is quite worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: The German army has withdrawn from the ruins of San Luo and is now defending new positions in the south of the city, repelling all attacks by the American army. General Dempsey's British Second Army has not slackened its attacks on the Divi River and the area south of Caen from the east bank of the Orne River, but the German army has taken effective countermeasures. The situation southwest of Caen has not changed. The enemy's attempts in the areas of Belles and Troon were repelled on Wednesday. The German army in the southwest of the area has recovered several places and advanced forward.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: At noon on Tuesday, the British army, with an unprecedented tense cover of artillery fire and more than 1,000 aircraft in preparation, launched an offensive eastward and southward from the bridgehead east of the Orne River. The purpose was obviously to reach the banks of the Div River in the east and advance several kilometers southward in order to turn west and reach the Orne River north of Caen. On Tuesday evening and night, several small villages southeast of Caen were repeatedly gained and lost, and repeatedly changed hands. On Wednesday morning, both sides added fresh troops to the battle, and the war became more intense. The situation southwest of Caen was relatively calm, probably because the British army had shifted its focus to the east bank of the Ona River, but at the same time, there was a fierce war in the Knoll Vantes area. In the end, the German army retreated one kilometer southward.</p>
<h3 id="e16">The German Army in Northern Italy Withdrew from Livorno <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities claimed: After the enemy of Italian cultivated land was severely wounded in fierce fighting, they invaded the completely destroyed docks in the south of Livorno (on the west coast in northern Italy), causing a fierce uproar. The German army withdrew to positions north of the city in the evening.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency News: On Wednesday, the war on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy expanded to the downstream area of the Arno River, all the way to Livorno. The American army advanced along the coast with tank vehicles and two infantry battalions and rushed to the German defensive positions in the east. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German army retreated to the foreign port, and fierce street fighting broke out in the southern part of the port in the evening. The German front line along the Adriatic Sea also retreated northward after fierce fighting, and there was also fighting late at night. The results have not yet been obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Situation on the Eastern Front <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced the situation on the Eastern Front as follows: The fighting on the eastern front from Garya to Lake Setz is extremely fierce. The center of the war is the Wolf area. The Soviet army crossed the Bug River with powerful troops and broke into the depths of the German positions. The Soviet army is using all means and is trying to penetrate to the Lvov area. The Soviet army is putting heavy pressure on the German detachment operation between Opociojaga and Poku, and wants to break through the new German positions, but the sovereignty of the operation is still in the hands of the German army. The German army in the middle of Kuloturno and the Kemmon River has counterattacked many times and has been successful. The defensive power of the German army in the Dvinard district is gradually increasing, which is quite worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Cai Rencun, a native of Wu County, recently colluded with accomplices such as Tang Yaosheng and several others to privately engrave a seal of the Intelligence Office of the City Security Office and a private seal of a certain official.

<p>Since the National Commercial Control Association implemented the household fabric purchase certificate system, disputes have frequently arisen when citizens move or return to their hometowns, requiring them to return the purchase certificate to the original issuing office. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired at the Economic Department of the First District Office and was informed that all purchase certificates issued by the First District on behalf of the National Commercial Control Association, if the fabric has already been purchased with the certificate, do not need to be returned when citizens move or return to their hometowns. The office has no such provision that household registration cannot be canceled within six months of obtaining the purchase certificate, and it is hoped that people will not misunderstand. As for any disputes between issuing offices in this district and citizens, please send a letter directly to Office No. 702 of this office for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the short commentary "Where Did the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Get a Large Batch of Rice?" in your newspaper on July 20th, we hereby reply as follows: Rong Huiren and other staff members of the Rice Control Committee requested this association to temporarily store 130 bags of Henglin rice transported to Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 17th of this month. At that time, because Mr. Rong was originally a staff member of this association and had been transferred to the Rice Control Committee, and the rice was verified to be from staff members who had followed procedures and obtained a temporary rice transport permit, it seemed inappropriate to refuse the temporary storage for a day or two. The entire amount was taken away at 3:00 PM on the 19th. This is the actual situation. We are sending this letter specifically to inform you, and we hope you will take note of it. Sincerely, Secretariat of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce. July 20th.</p>
<h3 id="e31">The Sea of the New Era and the China of the New Era – Broadcast Speech by Principal Jiang Xiyuan <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Xiyuan, Rear Admiral and Principal of the Central Naval Academy, gave a broadcast speech at 9:10 PM on the 20th, titled "The Sea of the New Era and the China of the New Era." The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The Maritime Spirit</p>
<p>"Today is the fourth 'Sea Day' celebration of our ally Japan. This 'Sea Day' does not have any special significance in the minds of the general public in our country. But if we think carefully about it, the reason why our ally Japan has been able to achieve world leaps and even take on the important task of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere today is precisely because the spirited people with a maritime spirit have been stimulated, vigorously promoted, and have seized the opportunity to catch up with all the standards of the world. In just a few decades, they quickly succeeded in becoming the most advanced and prosperous country. Looking back at our country's people, they have always adhered to the conservative customs of the continent, simplifying everything in a rudimentary way, being content with temporary ease, and arrogantly considering themselves superior, taking pride in their culture, which ultimately led to backwardness in everything. The main reason for this can be said to be the lack of adjustment to the continental nature, which, over time, has had a poisoning effect. Therefore, in the future, we must use the properties of the ocean to create a great spirit to replace the stubbornness of the nation for thousands of years, so as to develop the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, from this point of view, the Greater East Asia War will benefit our country as immeasurably as the sea.</p>
<p>Speaking of it, in ancient times, the great thinkers of our country praised the concept of the sea to the utmost. All vast and boundless things are represented by the sea. However, this concept of admiration inevitably leads to fear of the vastness and boundlessness, as well as the dangerous storms of the sea. There is a sense of sighing at the ocean, and the world and the nation are ultimately limited within the four seas. As for what lies beyond the four seas, it is only preserved without discussion.</p>
<p>The Power of Maritime Transport</p>
<p>The evolution of science has made maritime transport more convenient than land transport. The capacity of maritime transport far exceeds that of land transport. The power of the navy reaches far across the oceans. Culture, economy, and even wars in the world are all closely related through the commonality of the ocean. China, which has been trapped on the continent for a long time, is naturally no exception to this. However, the national inertia of thousands of years makes it very difficult to have any drastic changes all at once. Now, during the Greater East Asia War, the common future of the East Asian nations is threatened by the West coming across the sea. We cannot continue to dream of surviving comfortably on the continent, nor can we continue to engage in fraternal infighting. The ocean makes China realize that it can only survive under the unity of Greater East Asia. In the past, the sea was only an abstract greatness to China. The sea of the new era is a living element for people to get rid of the old and take in the new, but China needs it even more deeply.</p>
<p>Maritime affairs maintain most of human life. The execution of maritime tasks is the responsibility of the navy and maritime transport. In peacetime, the navy maintains maritime security to ensure the safety of maritime transport. In wartime, maritime transport is responsible for the transportation of materials and the supply of naval needs. These two tasks are like the two wheels of a car, complementing each other and indispensable. The Allied navy in this Pacific War is admired by the world for its heroism and invincibility, but the activity of its maritime transport sector is by no means inferior. The spirit of the transport sailors is no different from the traditional spirit of the naval officers and soldiers. Their arduous, unparalleled, and effective achievements in killing the enemy are also no different. We express our same gratitude and respect to them for their contributions to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Building the Navy</p>
<p>Our new navy has been under construction for five years. The people of the country probably already know about it, so I won't introduce it in detail here. Our maritime transport construction has not been heard of for a long time, but since the first class of students from the Central Advanced Merchant Marine School and the sixth class of students from the Central Naval Academy entered the school at the same time recently, and ordinary sailors are being trained at the Central Sailor Training Center at the same time, our country's maritime transport sector can be said to be just beginning. Such a two-pronged approach of the navy and maritime transport really contains the great significance of the new era. The people who have been trapped in the thinking habits of the continent for a long time should be enlightened by this, and hope that they will give this new model of maritime military industry a new understanding and practical assistance. In the future, the "sea" of the new era will no longer be ignored by the people of the country. In addition to government facilities such as national construction, military construction, navy, and maritime transport, what should be paid attention to in general is that aspects such as academic thought, customs, habits, and interests must have maritime characteristics incorporated into them. Painters should depict surging waves, blue seas, and clear skies, or handsome warships and magnificent merchant ships. Musicians should sing the magnificent and boundless spirit of the ocean. Writers should have eloquent and magnificent words, phrases, and verses, or maritime descriptions. Travelers should not be proud of returning from the Five Sacred Mountains but should call on each other after having experienced the vastness of the sea. Academics should have the excitement of searching for treasures overseas. If this is done, the maritime spirit will be promoted and deeply integrated into the national life and habits. This will directly and indirectly greatly benefit the construction of the navy and maritime transport, the revival of China, and the victory of East Asia. The new era might as well be called the era of the sea. Only with the role of the sea can there be a foothold for the era, especially China, which has embarked on the path of the Greater East Asia War and has a very long coastline."</p>

<h3 id="e33">The Enemy Changes Course <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— The Recluse of Jiangnan</p>
<p>Today, the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau announced that Prime Minister Tojo "in order to refresh people's hearts, so that the whole country can advance towards the completion of the war," decided on the 18th to have the entire cabinet resign en masse and immediately submitted the resignation letters of all cabinet members. The 18th was the day that the loss of Saipan Island was announced, that Umezu, Commander of the Kwantung Army, was transferred to the position of Chief of the General Staff, and that Admiral Nomura Naokuni assumed the post of Minister of the Navy on the following day. Seeing these events occurring one after another, will the propaganda agencies of the United States and Britain exaggerate that Japan has fallen into "a difficult situation" and boast of the success of their military and political efforts? They had already declared that the resignation of Admiral Shimada as Minister of the Navy and General Tojo as Chief of the General Staff were related to the loss of Saipan Island and were making every effort to propagate this as the most acute expression of the so-called "desperate state of Japan." Therefore, when they learn of the news of the resignation of the entire Tojo cabinet, they will surely be overjoyed and even more unrestrained in their poisonous remarks. Of course, such events would not occur if Japan were advancing on a clear path to victory. However, as General Tojo said when Saipan Island fell, Japan is now "in a momentous situation in history," and the entire nation, adhering to the belief in certain victory, will seize the "excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy and win" from this momentous situation and further tighten the collective strength. In the midst of this process, in order to refresh people's hearts, so that the whole country can advance towards the completion of the war, the Tojo cabinet, which has already completed its temporary mission, has announced its resignation. From this, it can be seen that this political change in Japan has a very great positive significance for the completion of the war. This has the same significance as the "enemy changing course" during the famous Battle of Tsushima in naval history, the so-called Togo Turn. At that time, it was only with this bold "enemy changing course" that it was possible to seize the opportunity for a resounding victory. Implementing such a bold measure in front of the enemy is originally a great adventure. If one possesses an overwhelming war power against the enemy and can leisurely advance towards the goal, this kind of self-risk would be unnecessary. However, this change is something that Japan is preparing to deal with the historically great situation and is resolutely implementing. From the wishful thinking of the United States and Britain, it is certainly recognized as the most acute expression of the dangerous situation in which Japan finds itself, but this is purely one side of the shield. The United States and Britain, secretly fearing Japan's final blow, are deliberately obscuring the other side. This kind of fact is repeatedly revealed, even in their most clever propaganda, and there are innumerable examples.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is within expectation that the United States and Britain are making great propaganda about the resignation of the entire Tojo cabinet as the collapse of the Japanese war system. However, this kind of propaganda only serves to expose their utter ignorance of the Japanese national system and political system. They witness the various political phenomena in Japan and distort Japan into a fascist political system, recognizing General Tojo as its leader and dictator. The absurdity of this view is immediately apparent to all Japanese citizens and those who truly understand Japan. Japan's political system is fundamentally different from that of Germany and Italy, so it is inappropriate to compare General Tojo to Hitler or Mussolini. Moreover, the American and British view that the resignation of the Tojo Cabinet is the collapse of Japan's war situation is nothing more than a self-consoling thought. Regarding the Japanese national system and political system, there will be an opportunity to provide a detailed explanation at a later date, but for the sake of analyzing the truth of the loquacious American and British propaganda agencies, it is specifically pointed out here. In short, the Japanese people's fighting spirit, which is becoming increasingly high due to this bold "enemy changing course," will make them painfully aware of the illusion of their self-consolation.</p>
<h3 id="e34">First Police Bureau Resolves to Crack Down on Illegal Pawnbroking in the District - The Public Can Report to the Authorities <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of this city has determined that interest rates that pawnshops should take are clearly defined by law, but currently, some pawnshops in this city do not follow the regulations, or even increase interest rates and shorten the pawn period without authorization. At the same time, there are also those who operate pawnbroking and pawn ticket businesses privately under the names of commercial firms, and others who lend at high interest rates, the so-called "usury," exploiting people with heavy interest, which is illegal and easily causes disputes. The office, with the task of administrative police and the mission of safeguarding the interests of the people, should conduct strict investigations and effectively crack down on the above matters in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. Therefore, it has ordered the administrative sections of each branch bureau to conduct thorough investigations and submit reports on the operating situation of pawnshops in their respective jurisdictions for investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Penalty Measures</p>
<p>As for the penalty measures, according to reporters, if pawnbrokers do not follow the prescribed interest rates or shorten the normal period, or if commercial firms operate pawnbroking or pawn ticket businesses privately, or if someone lends at high interest rates and exploits the common people, the public can report to the authorities for investigation and handling. For pawnshops with business licenses that operate in violation of regulations, the first offense will be punished as illegal operation, and the portion of the illegal operation will be ordered to be suspended. Repeated offenses will result in the revocation of the license and transfer to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. Commercial firms that operate pawnbroking businesses privately, and whose interest rates do not exceed the regulations, will be punished for operating without a license and ordered to stop the pawnbroking portion of their business. If their interest rates or pawn periods are illegal, they will be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. Other individuals who exploit others with high interest rates will be dealt with according to the severity of their circumstances in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Secondhand Goods Shops</p>
<p>In addition, the office has determined that the number of general secondhand goods shops, commercial firms, and other similar business establishments in this city is increasing daily. Their business is the buying and selling of secondhand goods, and they are places for selling stolen goods and fostering the habit of theft and crime. In the past, the concessions did not have regulations for these kinds of shops to obtain licenses and did not manage them, which was tantamount to letting them operate freely. In order to prevent the occurrence of the above-mentioned situations, a request has been submitted to the First District Office to handle these business licenses and to strictly manage them. Secondhand goods shops must submit a report on their daily business operations for investigation to prevent theft and the sale of stolen goods and to maintain public order.</p>

<p>Parcel Notice No. 611 from the Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration states: It has been previously notified in Parcel Notices No. 554 and 609 that the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Laiwu Post Office and Jining Post Office in Shandong Province, as well as those transiting through them, should be temporarily suspended. It has now been determined that the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Laiwu and Jining Post Offices can be resumed as normal. However, those transiting through Jining Post Office should still be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the weight of each parcel sent to Laiwu Post Office must not exceed 15 kilograms. The acceptance of parcels with collect on delivery to Huimin Post Office in Shandong Province, as well as the sending of commercial parcels and large and small parcel mail to Hanzhuang Post Office in the same province, should now be temporarily suspended. In addition, the sending of all types of parcels and large and small parcel mail to Bin County, Putai, and Linyi Post Offices in Shandong Province, as well as the sending of all types of parcels to Boxing, Huantai, and Chongxingzhen Post Offices, should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Central Bank to Accept Production Industry Loans as Much as Possible to Avoid Impact from Tight Credit <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai money market has recently become increasingly tight, and the interest rates for interbank lending have been listed, with the amount of short-term borrowing decreasing day by day. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry into the money market, this phenomenon of tight credit will have no impact on legitimate business operations and can prevent general speculative hoarding activities. The reason is that the Central Reserve Bank is tightening interbank lending even more strictly. Except for legitimate and reliable firms engaged in legitimate business, the bank is granting loans related to production industries as much as possible, but strictly refusing all other non-essential borrowing. It is also urging general commercial banks to carefully handle interbank borrowing, resulting in a shortage of funds for each firm. Since the beginning of this year, various financial institutions in this city, in response to the government's advocacy of increasing agricultural production and assisting in regulating the rural economy, have actively participated in handling the collection of production goods, such as cotton purchase loans, wheat purchase loans, rice purchase loans, and spring silk purchase loans, amounting to hundreds of millions of yuan. In addition, the Bank of Communications, China Xingye Bank, and other banks related to the interior have actively handled agricultural loans. As a result, speculative funds used to speculate in the past are gradually flowing into rural areas for investment and increasing production industries.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Careful Use of Town and Village Chiefs <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yangchou</p>
<p>Town and village chiefs are also members assisting the local government. Their duties involve earnestly conveying and implementing policies from higher authorities, sincerely suggesting improvements to alleviate the people's hardships. They also hold the primary responsibility for managing security, population movement, and the collection and distribution of food supplies for the people's livelihood. Therefore, although the position may seem minor, the responsibility is significant, and it is truly not something that those without political knowledge, administrative experience, and a deep understanding of righteousness can handle.</p>
<p>Currently, among the town and village chiefs, there are those who are wise and capable. However, most are ignorant and incompetent, or those who have climbed their way up through connections and bribery. Such individuals not only fail to assist the government but also abuse their power, exploiting the people, engaging in embezzlement and fraud, leaving no means untried. Such town and village chiefs can indeed be described as locusts among the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, I wish to condemn them in writing, urging the government to pay attention and fundamentally reform politics by first carefully selecting town and village chiefs. At the same time, I hope that those incompetent town and village chiefs will recognize the times and quickly retire. I am not making a reckless threat. Consider the report in various small newspapers on July 5, exposing a corner of the Pudong South District where town and village chiefs accused each other of embezzlement and fraud, leading to a public prosecution by the prosecutor. The content may contain inaccuracies, but it is unlikely to be entirely fabricated. It is said that the case was further investigated by the Shanghai Local Court on July 18. Regardless of which laws the three town and village chiefs involved will be subject to, the stain on the city has already been revealed to society. The government authorities should not ignore it and must consider improvements.</p>
<p>Such stains are everywhere, and some are hidden in darkness, making them difficult to detect. In short, improper appointment of town and village chiefs not only harms the people but also causes losses to the government. Conversely, wise and capable town and village chiefs can indeed assist in promoting government policies and alleviating the people's hardships. Therefore, carefully selecting town and village chiefs is as important as appointing civil officials, and it should be listed as a fundamental element of political reform without question. As for the current town and village chiefs, they must be carefully screened, and those who are unqualified should either be trained or dismissed. Once appointed, they should receive the same treatment as salaried civil officials, so that they can serve the government and the local community with peace of mind.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Ocean Youth Corps in the Decisive Battle Period <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Navy Admiral Takeshita Isamu</p>
<p>Special Edition for Ocean Memorial Day</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan's understanding of the ocean has indeed completely changed.</p>
<p>Our Japan Ocean Youth Corps has already gone through twenty years of history since its founding. Before and after the September 18th Incident, the development of the corps was far from reaching its peak. If we ask ourselves in the stillness of the night, Japan is a maritime nation, and if we want to develop vigorously, we must reflect carefully.</p>
<p>However, from the January 28th Incident to the July 7th Incident, the oppression of the Japanese Empire by Britain and the United States intensified. As a result, the determination and awakening of the Japanese people towards the ocean also gradually deepened. In short, the strong maritime defense concept of "enemies coming from the sea must be defended at sea" naturally emerged. Therefore, the scale of the corps suddenly advanced significantly.</p>
<p>It was during this period that the Greater East Asia War broke out. In the initial stages of the war, our Japanese Navy occupied most of the Pacific with skillful blitzkrieg tactics, and unprecedented war results were continuously announced. As a result, millions of citizens burned with a feeling of gratitude towards the Navy. Due to the flourishing of this enthusiasm, the driving force for the development of the Youth Corps was naturally created. The study of the ocean spirit was eagerly noticed in all aspects, which can also be said to be the foundation of Japan's inevitable victory. Therefore, a trend formed in Japan, and people joined the ocean continuously.</p>
<p>Below, we will describe it in outline.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>From last May to this year, I have toured Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu, Korea, and other parts of Japan. I also spoke individually with members of the corps in various places and personally witnessed their brave and hopeful attitude. However, as the war situation became increasingly difficult, they ran one by one to the ocean and the sky to fight desperately against the enemy. In my heart, I vaguely [blank space] continue the Aoki of Admiral Yamamoto. This admirable and moving attitude is truly exciting [blank space] minutes.</p>
<p>The heads of cities and villages personally commanded and trained under the guidance of the prefectural Ocean Youth Corps heads. Recently, due to the enhanced construction of the ocean spirit, they are actively fighting. In addition, the unit heads, elementary school principals, and other officers who directly undertake the guidance, work day and night, desperately training ocean warriors. This is truly admirable.</p>
<p>This is not only the case in mainland Japan, but also in other places. Not to mention Lushun and Dalian, even the Youth Corps are said to be training desperately. Recently, this Ocean Youth Corps movement has become popular in Manchukuo, and even in the poor and ruined Mudanjiang City, an Ocean Youth Corps organization has been established.</p>
<p>In addition, in Shanghai, Consul General Mu Bao took the lead in serving as the branch chief and formed the Ocean Youth Corps, conducting general training under the guidance of the Naval Special Landing Force and the Yangtze River Naval Force.</p>
<p>What needs to be emphasized and written about is the Korean Ocean Youth Corps. Korea had the Busan and Zhenhai Ocean Youth Corps a long time ago, but the members were mainly composed of Japanese children.</p>
<p>However, due to changes in the situation, when the Ocean Youth Corps was formed in Banya last year, it was organized by Koreans.</p>
<p>Because this achieved very good results, it is hoped that the Governor-General's Office, Zhenhai Guard Prefecture, Naval Attache's Office, etc. will do their best to help, and organize an Ocean Youth Corps for all Koreans.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>The Youth Corps produced in various parts of Korea merged into one, forming a national organization of the Korean Ocean Youth Corps. The founding ceremony was held in Gyeongseong in a grand and military manner on May 27, Naval Memorial Day. This founding ceremony gave Koreans a great feeling of gratitude and also gave a very good impact to the naval volunteers being recruited, and participants were very enthusiastic. In addition, the impact occurred not only on children, but also on parents, so the mothers who participated in the Youth Corps also united to jointly move towards the broad road of building Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>This Korean Ocean Youth Corps has a Japanese Ocean Youth Corps Korean Headquarters established in the Governor-General's Office, with the Director-General of Political Affairs as the head, and branches established in each province, with the governor as the branch chief. It designated more than 100 important cities throughout Korea to establish Ocean Youth Corps, finally completing this great goal on Ocean Memorial Day, July 20.</p>
<p>In addition, instructor training fires have been convened in Zhenhai, Wonsan, and other places. The number of members in all of Korea has already broken the record of more than 80.</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>Niigata, Toyama, and other prefectures that use the Sea of Japan as a training ground recently had the Nagaoka Ocean Youth Corps in Nagaoka, the hometown of the Marshal, all burning with the fire of inheriting the Marshal's legacy.</p>
<p>In addition, the Mikuni Ocean Youth Corps, with the group flag of Admiral Togo's bold strokes, and Fukui, Tsuruga, Kanazawa, Komatsu, and other cities, compete with each other, all under the guidance of ocean warriors and predecessors from their hometowns.</p>
<p>There is also Maebashi City, the hometown of the war god Iwasa, and the nearby Utsunomiya City, Hitachi City, and [blank space] City, all competing with each other and busy with ocean training before the games.</p>
<p>His Highness often visits, and the Yokohama City Ocean Youth Corps, which has such supreme glory, has gradually increased in number and has also increased the ocean training institute.</p>
<p>In addition, Aichi, Mie, Gifu, and other five prefectures centered on Nagoya have developed year by year due to their long history. Today, even Takayama is about to produce an Ocean Youth Corps. From this, we can see how unconquerable the power of the Japanese nation, the descendants of Emperor Jinmu, will be in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>V</p>
<p>The Osaka and Kyoto groups are all busy training in Osaka and Kun [blank space] Lake under the great assistance and guidance of the naval authorities. In addition, do not ignore the excellent and outstanding training of the Himeji City Ocean Youth Corps.</p>
<p>The development of the Ocean Youth Corps in Tottori, Shimane, Okayama, and Hiroshima is also very outstanding. The island [blank space], which has an ancient history of ocean development, is about to establish a prefectural Youth Corps centered on the Shinji Lake Ocean Training Institute. Okayama Prefecture is also determined not to show weakness and strives to train and organize the prefectural Ocean Youth Corps centered on Okayama City.</p>
<p>Looking at the four prefectures of Shikoku, the Ocean Youth Corps, with Kagawa Prefecture as the ocean training institute, has been universally established. The ocean youth warriors of the entire prefecture are actively training with this as the center. In particular, the Awashima Ocean Youth Corps, inheriting the fathers and brothers who have long developed overseas, rush to the seven seas and are determined to live and die at sea.</p>
<p>VI</p>
<p>Then there is Kyushu. In terms of quantity and enthusiasm, the Ocean Youth Corps can be considered the strongest in Kyushu. In particular, Fukuoka Prefecture has the highest number of people in the country. Nagasaki, under the direct leadership of the Zhenshufu, all male and female students from schools in the city have completely joined. Kumamoto and Kagoshima are all striving to practice without falling behind.</p>
<p>What comes to mind here is the National Congress of the Japan Ocean Youth Corps held in Kagoshima City in commemoration of the 2,600th anniversary of the Imperial Era. This Youth Corps Congress, which developed from Mount Takachiho, the center of the hidden history of national founding, to Kagoshima Bay, is indeed of far-reaching significance, but judging from Fushi, the development of the Corps today can be said to be unprecedented.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, the main ones are Keelung and Kaohsiung, and powerful Ocean Youth Corps have emerged one after another.</p>
<p>Since the Greater East Asia War, Taiwan has become a supply base in the south and now stands in a crucial position. Since everything is like this, of course the development of the Youth Corps will naturally develop forward.</p>
<p>VII</p>
<p>The Ocean Youth Corps, as mentioned above, has spread widely throughout Japan. There are now more than 3,000 groups with more than 530,000 members, and the number is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>However, if we think about the fate of a maritime nation, we should not be satisfied with this. To be honest, Ocean Youth Corps must be established throughout the country, even in poor and remote areas. Of course, there is no need to explain now, because the Japan Ocean Youth Corps is an organization that trains Japanese youth to become complete citizens of the maritime nation of Japan. As the war situation becomes increasingly difficult, when thinking about the future of the Greater East Asia War, which is bound to become a long-term war, it is urgent to hope that national leaders, parents, brothers, and the youth themselves must understand and rise up.

<h3 id="e45">Words from the Marine Laboratory <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Takatsuki Shun</p>
<p>What does the Marine Laboratory research? It researches the various aspects of the ocean, hence its alternative name, the Ocean Research Institute. However, the scope of the ocean is extremely broad, so even knowing its general outline is difficult.</p>
<p>For example, there is ocean physics, which studies the growth of the sea and the ebb and flow of tides; marine meteorology, which studies the relationship between seawater and weather; marine chemistry, which studies the composition of seawater; marine geology, which studies changes in the coastline and the properties of the seabed; and marine biology, which studies the various organisms that inhabit the ocean. At first glance, there are various types of learning.</p>
<p>The original intention of the Marine Laboratory is to study all these aspects of learning. However, not all of them are studied due to the convenience of researchers and the laboratory. What is generally handled is mostly in the field of marine biology. In addition, there are many places that study physics, chemistry, and meteorology together. However, places that specifically study Qi Meng are called marine meteorological observatories, and those that focus on aquatic products are called aquatic product test [blank space], which everyone already knows.</p>
<p>First, I will introduce the marine laboratories of various countries.</p>
<p>Germany's famous marine laboratory is located on the isolated island of Helgoland in the North Sea. It was founded 50 years ago. After the First World War, even when Germany was exhausted, it decided to rebuild the laboratory and equip it with modern facilities. This shows how enthusiastic they are about learning.</p>
<p>In Italy, the picturesque Naples has a marine laboratory. It has large facilities and a long history, but the equipment has not yet been modernized. However, what has been studied here so far has made great contributions to the academic world. This is all mainly based on the study of marine biology.</p>
<p>Speaking of marine research, one must think of Morocco on the Mediterranean coast. Two things are famous in the world about Morocco: casinos and oceanography. Why is oceanography popular in this small country? Because the former emperor was particularly interested in naval studies and built good exploration ships. Buildings such as museums and research institutes displaying collections are all beautifully equipped. However, now that the emperor has passed away, the research institute seems to be following suit.</p>
<p>England's marine laboratory is located in the naval port of Plymouth. What is studied here is marine biology and the marine physics of their lifeline, the English Channel.</p>
<p>The United States has marine laboratories and product laboratories on the island of Woods Hole on the Atlantic coast.</p>
<p>As for Japan's marine laboratories, they are generally affiliated with various imperial universities. Tohoku Imperial University has Asamushi in Aomori Prefecture and Onagawa in Miyagi Prefecture, Tokyo University has Misaki in Kanagawa Prefecture, Kyoto Imperial University has Seto in Wakayama Prefecture, Kyushu University has Tomioka in Kumamoto Prefecture, Nagoya Imperial University has Sugashima in Mie Prefecture, and Tokyo Fatherly University has Mukojima in Hiroshima Prefecture. In addition, there is the Mitsui Ocean Research Institute in Shizuoka Prefecture.</p>
<p>The research of these laboratories has its own characteristics. Taking the laboratory of Tokyo University of Science as an example, I will introduce its research situation.</p>
<p>The Shimoda Marine Laboratory of Tokyo University of Science is located in Nabeta Bay, outside Shimoda Town, Izu. What distinguishes this laboratory from others is that it studies geophysics and marine geography in addition to marine biology. In addition to various research rooms, there is a public aquarium, a collection specimen display room, and a ship for collecting and observing, which is indispensable for marine research.</p>
<p>The first thing that the laboratory's research should handle is the characteristics of the nearby sea. At the Shimoda Laboratory, twice a month, the date is determined, and a fixed location in the nearby sea is selected to investigate the physical and chemical properties of the seawater. This is usually called naval survey or ocean observation. What do these surveys and observations study? Because it involves many aspects, it is not possible to describe them in detail. As an example, the amount of water temperature and salinity.</p>
<p>The water temperature near the Shimoda Laboratory is greatly affected by the Kuroshio Current from the south, but this also has a major change with the nearby air temperature. As for the amount of salt in seawater, there are no large rivers near the laboratory, and there is almost no inflow of fresh water, so the amount of salt will not drop first. However, the amount of rain may be thinner along the coast. However, as long as it is slightly mixed together, it will not be affected, and only the Kuroshio will be affected.</p>
<p>Currently, the research at the Shimoda Laboratory focuses on biology. Some people even say that the origin of life is the ocean, but there are many creatures breathing in the sea. These creatures are naturally studied from various aspects, but first of all, it is the study of floating organisms. As everyone knows, plankton are tiny organisms floating in seawater and there are many kinds. Collected using special nets. This is an extremely important creature for knowing the characteristics of the sea. For example, when a sea current collides with a shallow beach, the things that were originally in the upper layer become the middle layer or the lower layer. However, each layer has its own unique plankton, and after getting close, you can know the changes in the flow of seawater. Also, plankton also changes due to water temperature, etc. Moreover, this is the seafood of fish, and it also fulfills important tasks in aquaculture.</p>
<p>In addition to plankton, the laboratory also uses bottom trawls to capture various organisms and study the biotope of the nearby sea. Moreover, not only the taxonomy of these organisms, but also detailed experimental observations of the characteristics of the living body. For example, take part of the planarian worm collected in seaweed and study the condition of the newly born part. Or cut off a part of the living body and transplant it to another individual to study its development.</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking of physiology and biochemistry, the digestive organs and the properties of digestive juices of only kinds and [blank space] etc. are studied. Some of these have the same properties as us humans, and some are different. In short, the research in the laboratory cannot be described one by one, and I will talk about it again when there is an opportunity next time.</p>
<p>From the above, Fuka wants to know what the Marine Laboratory studies? Finally, I would like to say what is the meaning of the research of the Marine Laboratory? In other words, why is a Marine Laboratory necessary?</p>
<p>From an academic point of view, as mentioned above, on the one hand, the physical and chemical properties of the sea are studied, and on the other hand, the details of the living organisms living on the sea are studied. However, as everyone knows, the so-called learning is definitely not limited to this. It is to control the air or use the sea. If you want to use the sea, you must first thoroughly understand the conditions of the sea. Otherwise, it is impossible to know how to use the sea. Therefore, learning is necessary.</p>
<p>If our country is a marine country surrounded by the sea on all sides, we cannot help but further promote marine research. The Greater East Asia Sea, which was laid by the hard work of the loyal soldiers, should be studied in every corner, and in natural science, we must also seize new rights. This is our task. (The author is the director of the Shita Marine Laboratory) (Translated by Sho)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Ocean Training of Japanese Youths — A Day with the Fukura Youth Group of Kanagawa Prefecture — <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The roar of crashing waves vibrates through the morning air. In the faint light, huge rocks resemble black cattle on the surging sea. In the east, the morning clouds glow with a reddish hue. Fishing lights twinkle, now bright, now dim. The darkness of night slowly fades away.</p>
<p>Inside the white tents, dozens of group members are still fast asleep in the fresh air of early morning.</p>
<p>At four o'clock in the morning, the wake-up call echoes across the still earth, reaching far out to sea. In an instant, a group of robust young boys, like small silver fish, pour out of their tents.</p>
<p>After the squad leader calls the roll, everyone, naked, silently walks towards the sea, still not fully bright, without a single word spoken. The air is solemn. Above, the stars twinkle brightly. These young boys together chant prayers to heaven and earth for a great victory in the Greater East Asia War. Afterwards, they begin their day's work.</p>
<p>"Learn from the sea, know the sea, use the sea as our stage..." They loudly sing their mission together, silently contemplating why they must accomplish the great task of Greater East Asia, and training their minds and bodies.</p>
<p>"Rowing practice! From boat number one, assemble at the harbor! Head south!"</p>
<p>After cleansing their minds and bodies of impurities, engaging in strenuous activity is truly a supreme pleasure! Boats bearing squad flags successively float onto the water. On the horizon, a distant island can be vaguely seen.</p>
<p>"Ten minutes at full speed! Direction free. Begin!" At the command, shouts arise, and everyone rows with all their might. On the calm sea, the bow of each boat kicks up white waves, and the sound of oars echoes. The future maritime warriors exert all their strength in their toes, waists, hips, and arms, rowing with all their might, as if on a battlefield, single-mindedly speeding across the dawn sea.</p>
<p>"Training stop!"</p>
<p>They can't help but shout several times. Both hands are covered in sweat. The members, fully appreciating the invigorating taste of the sea at dawn, each seek their way back. En route, each dangles a fishing line, trying to catch mullet. In every small boat, silver mullet can be seen jumping.</p>
<p>Breakfast is probably ready back at the camp. Everyone's stomachs feel empty, so they quickly row back, devouring their food with gusto. Some even use the mullet they just caught as a side dish.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the Sea</p>
<p>From seven o'clock in the morning, the lesson is academic. They can hear about various aspects of the sea. Today's lesson is about specimens of southern fish, which the teacher enthusiastically explains. Ah, how endearing is the word "South"! The South is not far, it is within our reach.</p>
<p>At 8:30 a.m., practice begins. The practice varies from time to time, sometimes it is fishing, sometimes it is construction, sometimes it is navigation... There are many varieties, too numerous to mention. Today's practice is measuring water temperature. On land, they listen to commands, and the route and measurements are explained on a nautical chart. Compasses are actively used on the chart. Afterwards, they each carry their instruments and run to the boats.</p>
<p>"Target: the tip of Cape Manazuru!"</p>
<p>"Water temperature measurement at point number two."</p>
<p>"Prepare to measure!"</p>
<p>The commands echo on the sea.</p>
<p>The members each record the items they have measured and create tables. White jellyfish float in the azure sea. But when they think of how their ancestors' blood once stained this sea red, everyone's faces become tense.</p>
<p>Their bronzed bodies are impervious to the summer sun's cruelty. As for sweating, what does it matter? A piece of seaweed clings to the bottom of the instruments they bring up. How heart-stirring this is!</p>
<p>"Point three, 28 meters, water temperature 22.5 degrees." The voice of the report gradually fades away.</p>
<p>At 10:30 a.m., they receive a communication from headquarters that training is over, and they return to port in droves. As everyone sorts their equipment, selects a landing point, and finishes their tasks, the boats reach the shore.</p>
<p>"Prepare to disembark!"</p>
<p>"Begin cleaning!"</p>
<p>All the members scrub the boats they unloaded ashore. They carefully wipe and meticulously repair them, striving to make them even better than the classroom. Not even a single plank is overlooked.</p>
<p>Under the shade of the trees, they open the nautical charts and tables, filling in the measured depths and temperatures. They not only record the temperatures of the upper, middle, and lower layers, but also note the currents and the state of the seawater. Things that were once just tales take on a special meaning. While writing down the results they obtained on a large chart, it is already lunchtime.</p>
<p>Lunch is eaten standing up. This is because at sea there are many times when one must work and eat at the same time, so they are trained to be able to eat freely anytime, anywhere. At first, this seems difficult, but soon they can eat freely.</p>
<p>After lunch, there is a two-hour break. Each person takes a blanket and chooses a suitable shady spot to take a nap. The Pacific sea breeze blows over their bodies, and with their eyes closed quietly, the intense training of the morning feels like something from a dream.</p>
<p>In the shade of the trees, they sing softly, the reflection of the sea sparkling. Their limbs stretch out freely, and their bodies seem to grow larger. How interesting this feeling is!</p>
<p>Swimming Training</p>
<p>At two o'clock in the afternoon, the trumpet sounds again, and swimming training begins immediately. Individual swimming styles are not taught in the youth group, what is taught now is only "group swimming" and underwater operations. Each squad forms a team, with the squad leader swimming in front. Moreover, in this training, they must endure hardship, not only are they not allowed to cry, but they are not allowed to shout for help.</p>
<p>"One-hour long-distance swimming, begin!"</p>
<p>Each team jumps into the sea together, swimming in silence. Squinting, stroking with hands and feet. Swimming and swimming, they gradually become exhausted and their arms sore. Sometimes, flying fish leap out of the sea, which looks really interesting. The tents on the shore become smaller, and the words on the roof cannot be seen clearly. After swimming like this for about an hour, they finally return to port. Everyone sings "I am a child of the sea" with vigor, and treads the path home. Whether it is in Guadalcanal or the Solomon Islands, it is this kind of strength and this kind of spirit that is manifested! Above the island of fire, a large patch of strangely shaped clouds floats.</p>
<p>At 3:30, a critique of the swimming training begins. Everyone gathers on the rocks, gazing at the waterway they just swam through, quietly listening to various explanations. What the tide is like, what the wind is like. Under the teacher's instruction, when they reflect on their own actions, some can't help but laugh wryly. Hearing that some were greatly surprised by seeing the sea breeze, they can't help but burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Evening Work</p>
<p>From four o'clock in the afternoon, the whole group is engaged in preparing dinner. Each squad researches how to cook food from the sea. The group processing seaweed, the group cooking small fish, the group roasting conch shells, all work hard, cooking various foods with unskilled hands. There is a great deal of edible food in the sea, and those who intend to dedicate themselves to the sea must strive to utilize it anytime, anywhere. The expanse of Greater East Asia is extremely vast, and they should receive all kinds of training.</p>
<p>After the meal, they listen to a critique of dinner. Someone hears others criticizing that the things he cooked are not tasty, and he says unconvinced, "My mom cooks it like this too!"</p>
<p>In short, their cooking is indeed of varying quality, but their efforts for the country are always admirable and praiseworthy.</p>
<p>At night, they either practice Morse code signals, or go night fishing, or conduct surveys of aquatic animals. Some are inside the tents, helping the squad leader with nautical chart calculations, or studying how to identify directions by the stars.</p>
<p>In this way, at eight o'clock in the evening, the sound of the end of training rings out, and everyone prepares to sleep. In every tent, sunburned faces can be seen. This face, this body, is the power of Japan. The coast gradually fades into the black curtain of night, in the sound of waves lapping the shore, mixed with the chirping of some unknown insects.</p>
<p>Knowing the sea and living on the sea, the future is far-reaching. Only through such orderly, unified, and rigorous training can one correctly know the sea and be active on the sea. The defense and industry of the sea, helping each other, can achieve excellent results, so we must work hard like this. (Kukawa Hiroaki) Translated from Ocean Youth, No. 553)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Lessons of Naval Battles <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>From the Casablanca Conference to the present day, our enemy in the Pacific, the United States, will never neglect the Pacific front due to its domestic situation and its desires regarding Chongqing, Australia, and other Pacific-related countries. Therefore, it has long been within our expectations that the Pacific front will respond to the European Second Front and take some kind of active counter-offensive action recently. As expected, the United States is attempting to knock on the door of our Inner South Seas head-on, Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands, and has air-raided the northern Kyushu industrial zone of Japan.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this kind of restless operation by the anti-Axis side is nothing more than the bravery of impetuousness, relying on the amount of their supplies. However, we must face up to the fact that the world war situation has therefore entered a decisive phase. At this critical juncture, 100 million people should not panic, but should advance towards the battlefield with firm determination. If we can do this, the enemy's collapse is imminent.</p>

<p>— Yi Xuan</p>
<p>Every time I visit Qin, she always asks me to stay for dinner, and tonight is no exception. We sit by the window, enjoying the slight breeze of early summer, and a black lampshade hangs over the lamp. Except for the center of the table, which is illuminated, the surroundings are dark.</p>
<p>Qin fills small, jade-like cups with clear rosé wine, raises her cup to me, and says, "Drink! This cup is to wish you eternal youth!" I take a deep sip. To my ears, these words seem full of sadness. Who can hold back the fleeting years?</p>
<p>It has only been two years since I left middle school, but the changes in people and affairs are simply unimaginable. The joys of the past have become sighs of today. Especially after this wine, it is easier to evoke memories of old friends. As these memories arise, we ask each other, as if by agreement, "I wonder how Mei is doing?"</p>
<p>"People may not see each other for life, like the stars Shen and Shang," Qin says with emotion, and after a long sigh, I sink into silent memories.</p>
<p>Mei, that short, plump, cheerful girl, has a pleasingly round face. She was admitted to university and majored in economics. Initially, at the monthly gatherings, her cheeks, like hot apples, still glowed with innocent smiles, and her speech was still as playful and straightforward. But she changed somewhat during the summer vacation of the following year, before the start of the school term. She often broke appointments, and when we questioned her, she often blushed, muttering incoherent reasons. Soon, we changed from questioning to teasing. "Mei has a lover!" The news spread faster than lightning.</p>
<p>Now that the secret was out, she often talked about him to Qin and me, who were closer to her. Whenever she mentioned Hong, her round face became even sweeter and more lovely!</p>
<p>In our eyes, Hong was just an ordinary person. He was short, had unremarkable looks, and a face full of acne, but he was very articulate. Therefore, Mei, who was inexperienced in the world, actually fell deeply in love with him.</p>
<p>Gradually, her cheerful and charming demeanor became very dull. The sweet smile disappeared from her face, and her eyes seemed to hide worries. We asked her with concern, but she just smiled bitterly and said nothing.</p>
<p>Last winter, on the evening of my birthday, after drinking heartily, she finally revealed her misfortune: it turned out that Hong was already married, with two children. Mei had even met his wife, who was a virtuous woman.</p>
<p>We all felt that this matter was easy to resolve, and we advised her to pull back from the brink and cut off the threads of love. Who would have thought that she would say painfully, "It is not easy to destroy a love that has already grown."</p>
<p>"Then can't you love each other as friends?" I said casually. "That's what I intend to do," she whispered.</p>
<p>Qin was a little older and understood human nature more thoroughly than we did. At this time, she said very seriously:</p>
<p>"Mei, it's better for you to distance yourself from him. You are still young, and you don't have the strength to control your emotions. Besides, you already have feelings that go beyond friendship. Stepping into a love affair is like sinking your foot into the mud, the deeper you step, the deeper you sink. And it is difficult to maintain a pure friendship between two heterosexual young people, especially like you. There are only two paths ahead of you, one is to distance yourself, and the other is to become more intimate. Mei! Be cautious, you should choose the first path, you can't continue to contact him, otherwise it will only cause you pain."</p>
<p>I thought carefully and also felt that this was very true. Therefore, we both advised her, explaining the advantages and disadvantages to her in detail. After spending the whole night talking, she was moved by us. From then on, she was indeed very cold towards him, but her heart was also extremely depressed. We each went to see her to cheer her up, but we couldn't invigorate her disheartened countenance.</p>
<p>When the winter vacation started, Hong came to invite her out from time to time, but she painfully refused. He also wrote letters filled with sweet words, which Mei read with tears every time. Finally, after the school term started, their old feelings rekindled, and they were even closer than before. For the sake of a moment's passion, she willingly plunged herself into eternal destruction.</p>
<p>Qin warned her several times: "Mei, don't gamble with your fate!" But she actually said, "You don't understand love, you don't understand me."</p>
<p>"True love will never arise from the impulses of lust." I believe Qin's words, but Mei hated us. Therefore, she no longer saw us, and we couldn't bear to watch her play the role of a tragic heroine.</p>
<p>"Wine enters the intestines and turns into tears of longing." Who says that wine can dispel sorrow? Yet again, "a cup can eliminate ten thousand ages of sorrow"?</p>
<p>After finishing dinner, I said goodbye and left. It was drizzling, and I firmly rejected Qin's offer to stay, walking slowly home in the rain with a drunken feeling. I could not be at peace. The singing of street performers came from the street, as gentle as the lament of a forsaken woman, which made me feel even more melancholy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was a knocking sound on the door: "Tap tap..." Who is it? I opened the door and looked down. "It's me." Ah! Mei is here! I hurriedly went down to open the door and welcomed her into the room. Under the light, her face was very haggard, and her wet hair hung messily on her forehead. In this early summer weather, she was still wearing a long coat, but it couldn't hide her slightly bulging abdomen.</p>
<p>She looked slightly shy, looked down at the ground and asked, "Can I stay for one night?" "Yes," I hesitated for a moment, "Did you have a conflict with your family?"</p>
<p>"No, I left home long ago." "Then..." I didn't know how to say what I wanted to say in my heart.</p>
<p>"Things have come to this point, I can't care about your ridicule, one wrong step leads to eternal regret, I have made a big mistake!" She finally sobbed, "We have been living together for several months. At first, he promised to divorce his wife, but then he repeatedly delayed it. Tonight, he actually said a lot of irresponsible words. I was extremely annoyed, had an argument with him, and ran out. In this late night, I have nowhere to go, so I have to come to you."</p>
<p>"Then what are you going to do in the future?"</p>
<p>"I have reached a dead end. He is not willing to divorce his wife, and I am not willing to be a concubine. Now that I have destroyed my own happiness, I might as well destroy my life too!" "No! No! Mei! You can't do that." I really hoped that Qin was here to help me comfort her and encourage her. I am too clumsy with words.</p>
<p>She silently wiped away her tears, the room was deathly silent. A moth was fluttering around the lamp. I hated its disturbance and waved my hand to drive it out, but in an instant, it came back in again. I looked at it carefully and couldn't help but say silently, "Blindly pursuing worthless love is just like this moth flying into the fire. Maybe it can get a temporary feeling of being close to the light, but it will lose its life because of this, and with it, the opportunity to enjoy real light."</p>
<p>The night passed so silently. Although she has now accepted Qin's instructions to rest assured and wait for childbirth before seeking a good plan, we are still worried about her all the time, afraid that her fragile heart will not be able to withstand the blow and will make another mistake.</p>
<p>A message to Mei: Bury the past mistakes forever. The sea of suffering is boundless; turn your head and you will see the shore. You have already made a sacrifice for love. Don't make Hong's wife and children also innocently sacrifice for your mistakes. Don't take love as your permanent home. It is only a small part of your entire life history!</p>
<h3 id="e49">Ah Gen and Mr. Zhao <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Nakazaki</p>
<p>For the sake of courtesy, people buy things as gifts.</p>
<p>The year before last, my father bought a gift to give. It was very precious! Maybe it wasn't quite precious enough, but to my father, it was already very impressive. Perhaps Mr. Zhao was displeased, thinking that such a worthless thing was actually counted as one of the gifts he received. Perhaps he would even throw it on the ground to vent his anger.</p>
<p>My father lay on the bed all day, depressed and without a smile.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the craftsman Ah Gen came to find my father to borrow money. I watched Ah Gen's smiling face and humble demeanor as he negotiated for a long time. I couldn't see the exact amount, but I was sure it wasn't much. He feigned a smile, bowed his body, and gave a bow. My father waved a fan at him as if shooing away a fly.</p>
<p>I watched him cross the threshold. I watched him counting the banknotes outside the door. Looking at his shadow, I felt an inexplicable sense of emotion rising up. Seized by a momentary impulse, I called out to him.</p>
<p>"Ah Gen!" He turned around in a hurry.</p>
<p>"Oh! Shao Yi! What? What is it?" he asked with a fake smile again.</p>
<p>"Dad told me to give you these too!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Young master! …This, …Oh! Thank you! …Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, young master! Thank you!"</p>
<p>"Dad said to give you these as capital. When you make money, you should pay it back. If you can't pay it back, then forget about it."</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah! …Ah! Ah! …Yes! Yes… Thank you, old master! …Thank you, old master! …The old master is so! …Truly!…" His sincere gratitude gave me boundless comfort, comforting me even though my enjoyment of the whole year would disappear from then on, no more ball games or movies. But I tried my best to make myself happy. I could play chess with my classmates, and I could read world masterpieces. How grateful that honest and reliable Ah Gen must be! Later, when he met me, he often asked about my father's health. I replied that my father was healthy.</p>
<p>"Thank God! Thank God!" he would say. During the summer vacation, my father bought a pair of cute little rabbits. They were tortoiseshell-colored little things, with interesting noses, playful ears, and constantly moving noses and mouths. Every movement and jump was adorable. We fed them green vegetables and carrots, and they grew quickly.</p>
<p>We all loved them, cared for them, and hoped that they would have baby rabbits.</p>
<p>The rabbit's belly grew bigger. The first to discover it was my little brother. He shouted:</p>
<p>"Mom! Brother! The rabbit's belly is big! The rabbit's belly is big!"</p>
<p>Because of this, the two younger brothers argued about "whether she is really going to have baby rabbits or not?" Later, her belly swelled day by day, and she finally gave birth to four baby rabbits.</p>
<p>After giving birth to the baby rabbits, the mother rabbit shed some fur. We cared for her even more. Every day after I came back from school, I would first come to see her and stroke her. If I had a free period, I would come back to see her once.</p>
<p>During that day's free period, I ran back again and saw Ah Gen squatting in front of the rabbit cage in surprise and joy, feeding her. "They're very fun, aren't they, Ah Gen!" I said.</p>
<p>"Oh! Young master! Yes,… Young master! You got out of school so early? …This, young master! Do you use a pen? …This,… young master?…" He gave me a red Guan Le Ming fountain pen.</p>
<p>"Ah Gen! Are you giving this to me? Don't do that! Ah Gen! What are you doing? Don't buy these next time!"</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Young master! Yes, yes..." He put on a smiling face again, "...Has the old master not come back yet?…"</p>
<p>"Not yet!… Ah Gen! Take it back!… Hmm! Leave it here, don't do it again next time!…"</p>
<p>"Next time, no! Next time, no!"</p>
<p>From then on, Ah Gen often came in to tease the little rabbits whenever he was free.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I was sick and had a very bad headache. My father was holding a banquet, and the people who came were all people like Mr. Zhao, along with their concubines. Of course, the banquet started very late. During the banquet, they elegantly discussed calligraphy and painting, and the women laughed quietly. I didn't know anything else.</p>
<p>After Sunday passed, there was nothing left of the banquet, but the rabbits had given birth to four more.</p>
<p>Soon, the rabbit cage seemed too small. The rabbits climbed all over the cage, bumping, squeezing, and the stench of urine and feces was very unpleasant. My mother suggested giving some away, leaving only two adult rabbits and two baby rabbits, and giving away the rest.</p>
<p>We discussed who to give them to!</p>
<p>"Two to the Zhao family! Two to the Qian family! Then what about the other two?"</p>
<p>"I think," said my father, "let's give them to the Zhao family too! Mrs. Zhao will definitely be very happy, wasn't she that day?"</p>
<p>So the rabbits were given away.</p>
<p>The next day, Ah Gen came.</p>
<p>"Eh! Young master! Why are there only these few rabbits left?"</p>
<p>"They've all been given away!" I said.</p>
<p>"Given away?" he said regretfully. But he added, "That's good!"</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! What's good about it? You liked them very much too, didn't you? Next time I'll tell them to leave a pair for you too! Haha!…"</p>
<p>"Haha… Young master! Thank you! Thank you!… Has the old master not come back yet?… Hmmm!…"</p>
<p>Despite the opposition of the whole family, I insisted on giving a pair to Ah Gen. Finally, Ah Gen got a pair—the least beautiful ones. And they were both male. He carefully carried them away with his clothes.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that the Zhao family's rabbits died from being played with the day after they were sent. Most of the others died too. My family's two pairs died because my father lost his job and had no mind to take care of them. Only Ah Gen's pair are still lively and clean, and adorable. And only Ah Gen still asks about my father's health from time to time. Tragically, Mr. Zhao selected my father when he was laying off employees.</p>
<p>Although this was three years ago, I still remember it clearly, and I will always remember it!</p>
<h3 id="e50">Night Sounds <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Kaji</p>
<p>The bread seller has passed through the street and finished the alley; a high-pitched, delicate voice shouts: "Hot bread for sale!"</p>
<p>The setting sun has just fallen, and the children have already gathered in groups to call their brothers and friends to buy bread. The shouts of vendors have risen on the yellow-tiled streets, continuing until late at night.</p>
<p>Inside the hazy yellow circle of light, you can vaguely see short, staggering figures following behind night travelers, one after another. The basket of bread is simply too heavy, and the children have to put down the basket from time to time. They breathe heavily but still try their best to shout. Although their bodies are very tired and their stomachs feel hungry, they can only swallow a mouthful of clear water at the sight of the bread in the basket, pick up the basket, and move on.</p>
<p>They dare not shout in quiet alleys, and in lively places the supply exceeds the demand. The children also dare not sell too far away from home; they wander, wander, just wandering around nearby.</p>
<p>At the end of the lane, the end of the alley, stepping on the fragmented shadows of the moon, a sharp shout from a small throat knocks on the windows of every household. Occasionally one or two families open the door and stick their heads out:</p>
<p>"Is the bread hot?"</p>
<p>"The bread is hot! How many do you want?" They answer as usual.</p>
<p>After completing a transaction, they carefully put away the money and once again stare with small eyes that contain three parts fear and four parts worry. They pick up the basket and look around in all directions for customers again.</p>
<p>It is life that has crushed the innocent hearts of children. Now, they are no longer carefree like spirits of the night. For the sake of survival, they have taken on the heavy burden of life.</p>
<p>The bread seller has passed through the street and finished the alley; a high-pitched, delicate voice shouts: "Hot bread for sale!"</p>
<h3 id="e51">The Contradiction of Circulation - A Confession of a Woman - <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Xun</p>
<p>... "Jiao, don't you find it strange?" She tilted her head and casually exhaled a puff of smoke, as if mocking herself, and also mocking this stubborn world.</p>
<p>"To be honest, it's really shameful. Although I'm not from a secluded background, I still studied for several years. I can't say how good I am, but I graduated from high school. My family can also be said to be well-off, yet I became a dancer. You can say it's a failure of Chinese education, or my own willingness to be vulgar and unambitious, but this is a fact, a miserable fact!" ...</p>
<p>... "If you want to know how I came out of my family and became a dancer, you must really want to know the details, right? Because it's filled with the air of a *mambo*!"</p>
<p>"In the year I graduated from high school, my father used the topic of 'a daughter should marry when she grows up' to arrange my marriage. Originally, getting married is a good thing, and I appreciate my dad's good intentions in finding me a very rich man, but how old is he? He's old enough to be my father."</p>
<p>"Of course, I couldn't marry such a person, so I opposed it. Daughters opposing their fathers' arranged marriages is very common in Shanghai, but it doesn't happen in our hometown. Under high pressure, the result is predictable. I only had two paths to take: either suicide or leaving my family. But how could I die! Because for life, everyone wants to hold on to it. As the saying goes, 'Even ants cherish life.' So I chose the second path." ...</p>
<p>... "Yes, you are nodding in approval. My serious attitude towards love must be touching!"</p>
<p>"However, what happens after leaving the family? I naively thought that as a high school graduate, it wouldn't be difficult to find a job in society. But after living in Shanghai for two months, the money I brought with me was almost used up. But nothing was achieved. Education taught me the meaning of life, but it didn't give me the ability to make a living. Even being a maid required a guarantor, so I didn't even qualify to be a maid. "I was really at a dead end. Is there a solution? Oh! If it were really a dead end, I wouldn't be talking to you so much here today. Fortunately, 'Heaven never seals off all exits.' Just when I was wandering on the edge of starvation and cold, someone gave me an opportunity, an opportunity to get out of my own situation in the most primitive way, which was to sell my looks and become a dancer." ...</p>
<p>... "When I was at the end of my rope, I naturally accepted this opportunity. Why wouldn't I? Some people advised me not to go, and I appreciate their kindness, but they don't even know what hunger is!"</p>
<p>"Because I have a pretty good appearance, and after a little study of men's psychology, I feel that men are very easy to manipulate."</p>
<p>"............" I couldn't help but smile slightly.</p>
<p>"You don't need to deny it, including you. In short, relying on my skillful methods and beautiful appearance, I'm doing very well. I have clothes to wear and food to eat, and I'm no longer afraid of cold and hunger. Not only that, but I've also become popular. I have supreme enjoyment in life. Although some people criticize my frivolous life and dissolute lifestyle, I don't deny it, because that's exactly what I'm like. I've learned to squander and spend my life in advance, seeking as much enjoyment as possible...."</p>
<p>"Because the dance floor is only a five-year world! Have you ever seen a middle-aged popular dancer! I often think that dancers are like flowers in spring, and when they wither, no one wants them anymore."</p>
<p>"Therefore, for several months, I have been thinking about a question that I had never thought about before, which is the question of my own destiny."</p>
<p>"You can be considered the only friend I've met in the world of pleasure. I'm naturally telling you the truth. I've met many dance partners over the years. If I were to marry someone young, there would naturally be many, but I can only talk about love with them, but I can't marry them, because most of them don't have any money."</p>
<p>"The environment is terrible, isn't it? You know, the more money you have, the more you feel like it's not enough! Now there is an elderly person pursuing me, oh! Not pursuing, but developing an interest in me. He has a lot of money. I really don't know how he accumulated so much money."</p>
<p>"He is interested in me like a commodity, and I opened the asking price as if it were a rare treasure." ...</p>
<p>"Don't be dissatisfied. Money is omnipotent. I think if I'm already selling my looks piecemeal now, why can't I sell myself entirely to him if he can give me financial satisfaction, even though there is an age difference of thirty years."</p>
<p>"Life is inherently full of cyclical contradictions! Imagine, if I really marry an old man for money now, why did I have to leave my family in the first place!" ...</p>
<p>"I have suffered in society in vain, experiencing more hardships, but also overturning my previous view of life. Society is a big dyeing vat; life is inherently a cyclical, contradictory, and organic entity!" And me? Still silent.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Survival of the Fittest is the Natural Law; The Volleyball League Reveals Strengths and Weaknesses; A Suggestion Regarding Referees <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the start of the volleyball league, it has only been two weeks. However, the number of teams in the men's and women's groups is relatively small, and with the withdrawal of the Soviet team, the strengths and weaknesses are now clear, the clues are already there, and the situation is set. Following the previous issue, I will describe the battle situation of each game in order, and then talk about the situation of the men's and women's teams.</p>
<p>Zhiqian Shows its Power; Huayan Retreats</p>
<p>Last Friday (the 14th) there was one women's game (the Soviet team withdrew from Group A, so the game against Russian Overseas Chinese A was canceled). Zhiqian first met Huayan, the latter being a very promising team. However, this game seemed unfamiliar to the prostitutes, and both Zhu Wenpei and Zhang Xieyue, who scored in the attack, made more mistakes than successes. Therefore, the Zhiqian team was able to do whatever it wanted, winning with a score of two to zero. Watching Zhiqian's performance, it is indeed much more progressive than the Huabian era, especially the old and strong Zhang Jiasui and Zhu Shifang, and the young and promising Weng Lanqing and Xu Wei, who have the most significant performances. Therefore, the singing of triumph is also dependent on the efforts of these four generals.</p>
<p>Yuehua Improves; Easily Takes Russian B</p>
<p>This election only had one game (the women's Soviet team withdrew, so the game with the Green Team could not be held). Yuehua made its second appearance, and its performance was much improved compared to the game against Huaying. And Mai Bingyao's presence on the field, in terms of attack, has a centralized provider, who can attack as usual, which is the key to winning. And the repeated rescue of dangerous balls by the three rows of Huang Yaohua, Yu Xun and Zheng Shichang won a lot of applause. Russian Overseas Chinese B once defeated the White team, and the ball skills are quite impressive. Ivanov's spike is extremely fierce. It is a pity that the whole team panicked when facing a strong enemy, so they could not avoid a disastrous defeat. Yuehua remained cautious throughout and won with a straight three.</p>
<p>Zhiqian Wins West Qinghong; Russian Overseas Chinese A Defeats Huaying</p>
<p>Wednesday (the 19th) had one game each for women's and men's groups. In the first women's game, Zhiqian fought West Qinghong. The former used all its strength and overwhelmed the foreign women with two to zero, and the revenge of Da Hua against the West Qing League was avenged. The reason is that West Qinghong is really not used to the eating points of the Far East rules, and there are occasional pushing and fighting between each other. The Zhiqian team has been in a good state recently, and there is a famous teacher to guide them. Every day at sunset, they are buried in hard training at the Shanghai Girls' High School stadium. It is no coincidence that they have achieved this result.</p>
<p>The men's group of Russian Overseas Chinese A played with seven people, and actually killed the Huaying team without leaving a piece of armor. In the second game, Russian A won with a huge difference of twenty-one to one, which was beyond our expectations. The Huaying team's talents are not balanced, and they practice less, so how can they not be defeated. In this battle, Tan Yongzhan not only lacked martial arts, but also made many mistakes, which was also a big abnormality. Although Russian A had seven people, the seven people were able to have fierce serves, vicious chops and slams, and winning seemed very easy.</p>
<p>Looking at the current situation, in Group A, only Russian A and Yuehua are competing, while in the women's group, there is a three-legged situation between the Green Team, Zhiqian, and the Three Provinces. The fierce battles and the winning of the championship in the future will be nothing more than these few teams.</p>
<p>Two Strongholds Compete for Hegemony in the Group A Situation</p>
<p>The undefeated players in Group A are the two strongholds of Russian Overseas Chinese A, and these two teams are also the most powerful in terms of strength. Judging from the current situation, Russian Overseas Chinese A is likely to win the championship. The team's powerful serve is enough to make the enemy team feel cold. Especially Lotchiev's rapid ball like a cannonball. Victory against the Huaying team is also very possible. If the Russian four are able to make use of their broadsword skills and Yuehua can use both softness and strength, if they can use more wisdom than strength when they meet, the blue-eyed children may not be able to show their talents. What do you think about ordering the team to do so?</p>
<p>The Women's Group Has Become a Triangular Confrontation</p>
<p>In the women's group, Huayan West Qinghong have all suffered defeats, but the three strong teams of the Hua team have maintained a winning record, and it was expected before the game that this triangular confrontation would be formed. According to the three teams, they are all fighting each other and hiring teachers. The Three Provinces have Liu Hesheng, Zhi Qian has Mr. Zhu and Tan, and the Green Team has Xu Cang. According to the reporter's inspection, the Three Provinces attack better than defense, Zhiqian's attack skills are more novel and varied, and the Green Team's offense and defense are not outstanding, but very balanced. Therefore, it is difficult to make predictions and comments on future gains and losses. Moreover, the performance of women is quite changeable, and the success or failure is uncertain. When encountering strong enemies, there are even more significant psychological changes. The success or failure based on this is certainly not inferior to its own skills. In a word, the Three Provinces have been working hard for more than a year, and they should get what they deserve. The Zhiqian team has put a lot of effort into all aspects and should not be disappointed. The Pa Green Team's volleyball team was hastily formed in this session, and there was no ambition to win.</p>
<p>The Rules Do Not Have Explicit Limits on How Referees Restrict</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter couldn't help but have some thoughts on the referee's strict restriction on jumping during the serve.</p>
<p>According to volleyball competition, the server has to use fierce arm strength to make the ball pass the net, and it is very easy to jump. However, the referee restricts it. The reporter has praised the volleyball rules, and there is no such stipulation. I don't know who proposed this restriction and passed it on to this day. The following is the second rule on serving in the competition rules of the volleyball rules.</p>
<p>"At the start of the game, the first person in the serving order of the serving team should serve the ball with one hand (open or clenched) from the net into the opponent's zone. When serving, the player's feet should stand behind the end line (that is, the place farther from the end line than the net) and between the extended lines of both sides. From the time of preparing to serve until the ball is hit, the line of the feet must not cross the end line."</p>
<p>The rules are only like this, and you can only cross the end line, and jumping does not necessarily cross the end line. Therefore, the current referees do not know what the basis is. Or is it a mistake? The reporter sincerely hopes that the referee's mistake, if it belongs to the latter, then I hope to correct it immediately, and there will be no such restriction in future games. Furthermore, iron sports are inseparable from a jumping movement. For example, blocking and spiking must have a high jump to be successful. Why limit jumping only when serving? I hope the refereeing committee will give me a reply, or adopt my opinion, it would be fortunate!</p>

<p>— (Shan Miao)</p>
<p>Pandas Overwhelm Portuguese Merchants</p>
<p>The All Shanghai Softball League has been going on for three weeks. The Chinese powerhouse Pandas team (Pandas) lost to the Jewish team by a score of seven to two in their first game. The team was originally scheduled to play against the defending champion "Lusitano" Red team last Sunday, but was postponed due to rain. Many spectators went to watch the game because they learned about the strength of the Chinese team from our newspaper. Later, they were all disappointed and returned due to the postponement. Last Sunday, the team met the Portuguese Green team at Jiaozhou Park again, and thousands of Chinese spectators attended. On this day, the Pandas team won again, and the Portuguese Merchants team was completely defeated. The score was twelve to two.</p>
<p>Nine People in the Battle</p>
<p>The Pandas team only fought with nine people during the game (a softball team has ten people). According to team leader Dr. Eason and coach, the team's famous Japanese shortstop Wen Ruixiong was unable to attend due to an accident, and catcher Huang Yingrui suffered a hand injury during practice. Huang Yingrui insisted on playing despite the pain, because the team's other catcher Wang Xiushan and substitute Liang Youwen were unable to play due to illness, so they could only play with nine people. Before the game, spectators on the field, both Chinese and Western, believed that the Portuguese Merchants would definitely win, because the team has the famous football players Fu En and the Petersen brothers, whose dexterity and ball skills are not inferior to their feet, and they hit the ball better than the Pandas team. The reporter was also worried about the Chinese team. It is well known that the Pandas team worked hard to attack, causing the Portuguese Merchants team to be flustered and slaughtered by the Chinese team, leaving no armor behind. The Chinese people on the field cheered and clapped their hands enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Tense Battle</p>
<p>The game was extremely tense. In the first inning, the Pandas attacked first, and second baseman Lu Zhaosen hit a single, followed by catcher Huang Yingrui and first baseman Wang Nianzu, who also cleverly hit the ball and made a full base (Fallbase). At this time, the Portuguese team tried to calm down and defend under this dangerous situation. The fourth batter was the famous Japanese player Liang Yousheng. At this time, the audience all hoped for a home run (Home run) so that all three people on the base could return to the base. Mr. Liang lived up to expectations and made a desperate sound, and the ball flew straight to the outside. Lu Zhaosen and Huang Yingrui both returned to the base and scored two points, and Mr. Liang had already stolen to second base. At this time, no one in the Chinese team was killed (Down). Then, third baseman Wen Tianhua attacked, and with a wonderful bat swing, Liang Yousheng and Wang Nianzu also returned to the base and scored two more points. Tang Weiye and Li Qi were both out on high balls. At this time, the Chinese team had a last chance and lost to left fielder Lao Quansen. The Chinese team scored six points in the first inning. When the Portuguese team attacked, under the strict defense of the Chinese team, three people went up and three people went down, and no one got on base and returned empty-handed. In the second inning, both sides gained nothing. In the third inning, Wang Nianzu scored one point for the Pandas. The pitcher Li Qisheng sacrificed himself and used a short bat to lure the enemy to throw to first base, and Zhong Baoluo stole back to the base to score one point, which was even more commendable. The Portuguese team still did not achieve anything in this inning, and the Chinese team already had an 8-0 lead. In the fourth inning, Lu Zhaosen scored one point in a desperate sneak attack, while the Portuguese team was still depressed under strict defense. By the fifth inning, although the Chinese team had attacked, they were all caught by the Portuguese team's outfield. At this time, the Portuguese team had gradually shown its edge. When attacking, it was Camelov's turn, and he hit a high ball that flew straight to the center field. Zhong Baoluo of the Chinese team quickly jumped up and caught it tightly. Mr. Zhong's posture was beautiful and won a lot of applause. Then Laolkin of the Portuguese team attacked, and with a posture like a splitting axe, the ball was like a missile flying straight through the left outfield. Who knew that Lao Shusen was unwilling to fall behind and caught the ball with a somersault. The Portuguese team really complained about the loss of these two balls. Because if the Chinese team missed one, there would be a hope of a home run and two points. Later, Handerson of the Portuguese team attacked, and due to the mistake of the Panda catcher, he got a double. When the football star Petersen attacked, Handerson returned to the base and broke the egg and scored one point due to Lu Zhaosen's slow throw. In the sixth inning, Lu Zhaosen made another contribution, and the Portuguese team stole back to the base again due to Wang Nianzu's slow throw and scored another point. In the last inning, the Portuguese team was generally defeated, and they still defended desperately, but Tang Weiye and Zhong Baoluo scored two more points, and the Portuguese team had to fight hard to attack, but they achieved nothing under the tight iron wall of the Chinese team.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pandas team's ball skills are indeed excellent, but the team's defense is actually better than its offense. In this battle, every ball of the Portuguese team's attack reached the bat, and they were all outfield balls. If the Chinese team's outfield was slightly worse, they would have been defeated. The reason why the Pandas won is actually because the Portuguese team's shortstop and pitcher are incompetent on the one hand, and because the Chinese team's defense is better on the other hand. Try to observe that in the first, second, third, fourth and seventh innings, the Portuguese team all went up and down three times, and even if there was a single, they could not escape the second base kill. The contributions of this game should be rewarded with Lu Zhaosen's agility in hitting the ball. Zhong Baoluo's locomotive-style stealing of bases made the Portuguese team and the ball being shoveled to the ground. The connection between shortstop Liang Yousheng and third baseman Wen Tianwei made it difficult for the Portuguese team to escape the law. Other players such as catcher Huang Yingrui and first baseman Wang Nianzu all catch the ball steadily. What is particularly worth mentioning is that the Chinese team's pitcher Li Qisheng's pitching is steep and has a curve, and the softness and hardness are measured, which makes the Portuguese team swing empty bats.</p>
<p>In short, if the Pandas team work hard, they will win the championship in the future, I dare to say. However, the team should train more on hitting the ball, because the hitting skills of each member are not balanced, and they are not good at hitting home runs, so they should practice more. Otherwise, if the pitching of Tom butler of the "Lusitano" Red team is lowered, I am afraid they will not be able to resist it. The following is the Pandas team's schedule:</p>
<p>Pandas Schedule</p>
<p>July 23: vs Viking August 20: vs F.M.U, (Philippine Overseas Chinese) September 3: vs Pirates September 10: vs Y.oubs West Qing Team) September 17:: "Lusitano" (Red Team) (Lusitano red)</p>
<p>Each game starts at 9 am in Jiaozhou Park. No admission fee</p>

<p>Pei Cheng Telegraphs: Our Director Zheng Peimin is extremely enthusiastic about sports. Now he is specially organizing the "Fengfeng Cup" ship ball league. The location has been tentatively set at the Huaying Ball Field. The restrictions on joining the team are extremely strict. Zheng Jun is striving to improve the level, so the men's and women's teams may use the invitation method.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Zhemin of Lianhua Bank is reviewing the details of holding a "One-One Bank Basketball Tournament". Only pure bank employees can participate to promote leisure and exercise. It will definitely be supported by various banks.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Sports Association members held an invitation performance last weekend for mesh ball games, the various rafts have gradually become excited again. It is heard that someone intends to organize a senior and junior singles and doubles championship, but I hope it will be realized as soon as possible, so that we can see this seasonal sports competition.</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Hongkou Swimming Pool, it has been crowded with people every day. Being among them, it is believed that it is only the flavor of immersing in the water, so only the skills can be displayed. I sincerely hope that the authorities can find a way to close a few more places so that good swimmers can get what they want.</p>
<p>Football referee Deng Fangliang has been performing refereeing duties for many years, with rich experience and a very sincere person. Unfortunately, Mr. Deng was recently seriously injured by a team in a small football match and is now recovering. This news is an obstacle to rectifying sports ethics, and it is heard that the authorities have serious measures to deal with it.</p>
