<h3 id="c1">代論一封公開信結城先生： <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>欣悉閣下來華考察，無任歡迎。孔子說：［有朋自遠方來，不亦樂乎。］我們對於閣下不辭勞頓，千里跋涉，實與孔子所說的同樣快樂。我們所樂的，所歡迎的，因爲閣下次來是關心中國，尤其關心中國的人民。　　中國境內，除了南京國民政府以外，還有負嵎西南的重慶，盤踞西北的延安，兩種政治勢力，這是不必諱言的事實。所以，在客觀上強化國民政府，造成全國政治的中心，自屬必要。但是國民政府必先給予人民最低限度的政治要求，也是必要的。否則人民的趨向不免更形分散，而國民政府的力量也不免更爲減低。強化國府的方法有兩種，其一是內在的，用人唯才。目前國府的弱點，不可否認的是人才不夠，中樞人才不夠，很難發揮領導作用，因而影響到省政與縣基窘政治。因爲人才不夠，一般人沒有政治信念，政治不上軌道。其二是外在的，中國目前在國際上關係最密切的，當然是日本，所以，國府希望強化，對於日本的協力就最爲深切。我們認爲中日旣屬同盟，對於爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利，信念餘來，日本實施對華新政策後，責國旣以獨立自主期待中國，中國當局就應當負起獨立自主應有的完全責任，除軍事及與軍事有極密切關係的物資應由日本辦理以外，對於政治經濟的一切措施，凡是中國當局可以管理者，應由中國當局單獨負起管理的責任，同時，日本當局應即充分信賴中國政府具有單獨管理的能力。於此，我們始終認爲除軍事以外，日本方面對於中國人民愈減少直接發生關係愈好。換句話說，國民政府的使命，應使和平區內人民對於日本的感情能夠一天天的好轉，從而推及到全國。　　目前中國的經濟危機，已經到了極嚴重的程度，中國人民素來時習於刻苦耐勞的，而又無過奮的希望。過去三十年來內亂頻仍，始終在委曲忍耐中度過，尤其對於這次解放東亞民族，寂滅英美的戰爭中，凡是戰時應忍得痛苦，人民都能夠忍耐的。然而，兩年餘來，最矛盾的現象，是貧富的懸殊，暴富得益富，赤貧者更窮，相差過遠，而暴富與赤貧者，同樣是不能支持戰爭的。能夠協力戰爭者，却是一般薪水階級與智識份子，但是薪水階級與智識份子的生活，都已到了極危險地地步。如何使協力戰爭者得到最低的生活要求，實在是目前中日當局最重要的課題。　　協力戰爭，在中國的現階段言，只有貢獻物資，而物資的來源依賴生產，不能生產則物資必有窮時。中國人民幷不偷懶，爲了生活，爲了協力戰爭，都願意努力生產，可是生產的要件是治安，原料，動力，運輸數項，而這幾項在中國現階段是沒有辦法解決的，非賴日本切實的協力不可。　　我們細心觀察，兩年餘來，中國無論在政治上經濟上，都是只有退化而沒有進步，在人民立塲，希望中日當局切實反省，如果不能檢討過去的失敗缺點，而亟國革新途徑，那末，我們不能忽視目前隱伏的最大危機，就是共產主義的毒燄蔓延。所以，消滅共產主義的毒菌，一反過去的政策，最主要的使政治經濟的設施，都能顧到中國的國情與民情，綫能得到人民的中心擁護。　　閣下係歸國政治界元老，同時是經濟界權威，這次來華，中國民間的期待，特別殷深。我站在民間的立塲，敢就積感，奉陳左右，敬祈垂癹，幸甚，幸甚。　　　　陳彬　酥三十三年十月廿一日</p>

<p>○東京二十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午四時發表：日航空部隊，十月十九日對來襲尼科巴羣島加尼科巴（Ｃａｒ　Ｎｉｃｏｂａｒ）島之敵英機動部隊，加以迎擊後，於該島南方海面，擊沉其航空母艦及驅逐艦各一艘，擊毀其戰艦及驅逐艦各一艘。　　○東京二十日中央社電　於夫列查麾下至印度洋機動部隊，是七日（麥克沃塞部隊侵入菲島雷伊泰灣之日）來襲東尼科巴羣島之加尼科巴島西方海面，於十七，十八，十九三日，以艦載機與砲擊反復攻擊，日空軍當即對之猛攻，擊沉其空母，驅逐艦各一艘，擊傷氣戰艦，驅逐艦各一艘，其戰鬥進過如次：十七日九時許，敵機二十餘架來襲，同時敵空母三艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦數艘。出現於尼科巴島西方海面，十時半向日方機塲港灣砲擊約二小時餘，激戰後，被日方擊落其船三艘，出現尼科巴島西方海面，二時許開始向尼科巴島西部海岸砲擊，約一時，十九日九時半，敵艦載機及戰艦二艘，空母二艘，巡洋艦三艘，開始砲擊尼科巴島，十二時許中止砲擊，而行南下，十二時許，日空軍開始猛攻敵艦隊，結果擊沉敵驅逐艦一艘，空母一艘，爲日空軍於敵空母上空徘徊一週後，即投下炸彈十餘枚，均行命中，敵空母當即冒起黑烟，同時該艦中部並爲日雷擊機放射之魚雷二發所中，故瞬時即爲濃烟包圍，而行沉沒。此外，日機於尼科巴島西方海面更擊毀其戰艦及驅逐艦各一艘，又是日空戰，敵機損失四架以上。</p>

<p>○東京二十四日中央社電　日本政府冀贊會及冀贊會，爲展開決戰必勝之一大國民運動，期於中央組成國民運動中央本部，乃強力決勝運動之第一策，並爲普遍展開寂滅英．美運動，特於二十日下午一時，由中央本部假東京日比公谷會堂，舉行擊滅英．美國民大會。自一時開會，由政府方面小磯首相，大達內相，重光外相，松阪法相，島田農商相，衫山陸相，米內海相，廣船厚生相，石渡藏相，安藤事務總長等及國政會小林總戴外各員均列席，由安藤冀贊會團體部長司會開會，行禮如儀後，首由冀政總務金光氏致開會詞，其次即爲小磯內閣總理大臣兼冀贊會總裁之演說，內容充滿決勝不屈之精神，並向中外宣揚斷然擊滅美．英之不動信念。其次並由冀政總裁小林躋造大將及岡田衆議院議長相繼作熟烈之演說，披瀍作戰必勝之確信，至午後三時始告閉會。把握戰爭主動地位</p>
<p>○東京二十日中央社電　日小磯首相於國民大會席上講演要旨如次：國民待望已久之決戰，終已揭幕，決定　國將來命運之戰鬥，已行開始，三四日極端期間，獲得之偉大戰果，此在古來戰史上實罕見其例，無論誇稱物量如何　富之英美，對今次之損害，亦當深感苦痛，目不待言，即崩潰之幾多中立國及軸心系小國，親日本如此精強，對今後國際政局之推移，亦難急速斷定軸心方面之不利矣。尤其大亞洲各國家，各民族，由於此次之大戰果，當更自覺今後日本之必勝與大東亞建設之必成，然我等同胞必須銘記，此次勝利乃決戰序幕之戰果，本格之決戰，實自此開始，吾等唯有以此次之激戰應當以較此更爲激烈之激戰，直戰至使敵軍屈服爲止，如斯始可把握戰爭之主動地位。緬甸國及菲律賓國均已完成獨立，得從英美之桎梏中解放出來，至於東印度，亦將於最近之將來，完成其年來期望之獨立，此外，對於江特拉鮑斯氏所領導之自由印度臨時政府，亦在物心兩方面予以充分之支援，期使旣經失去之印度獨立，於最近之將來得以恢復，凡此諸端，均係日本對外精神之表現。中日國民應互理解</p>
<p>東亞二大國家一爲日本，一爲中華民國，惟此兩國間竟發生事變者，要亦由於英美之奸策所促成，故中日事變實可謂確立東亞和平途中之不幸事件，然而在中國方面，由汪精衛氏等賢達之士努力，日本之真意，遂爲一般人氏所理解，蓋自與國民政府關締結堅固之盟約，經過去一時之衝突，反而使中日邦交更臻堅固，時至今日，兩國更能在同生共死盟約之下，相與協力，完遂大東亞戰爭。本人係對於中國國民希求完成獨立之願望具有充分理解之一人，日本國民對於中國國民容有未能充分同情與理解之處，此雖爲難予否認之事實，然而中國國民亦應善爲諒解日本及日本人，以及體念對於東亞復興之真正碍阻爲何物，良以日本所求於中國者，旣非權益，亦非經濟上之獨佔，更非謀領土之擴張，吾人亦切望於中國者，爲中國回復東亞民族應有之自覺，建設一自主獨立真正強大之國家，與日本並肩成爲東亞之中核體，共存共榮，期於東亞之進展有所貢獻，事故，日本乃有首先交還租借，廢除治外法權，以符中華民國多年願望之舉。月下日軍在中國，雖仍在作戰，然而此決戰非以中國民眾爲敵，亦非以中國軍隊爲對象，甚至不依賴英美勢力者，雖重慶軍隊，亦不以之爲敵，渝方不特未能認識中國本身之真正敵人，反而爲真正敵人所主使，妄自對日本發動無益之抗戰，致使真正敵人愈益跋扈，關於此點，深抱遺憾。同時，切盼中國民眾速醒迷夢，熟思東亞連續發生之各事態之真像，立刻恢復復興東亞之自覺。後方國民意志明朗</p>
<p>來敵人以吾人復興東亞之基礎日臻鞏固，非常焦慮，傾注全力，擬速行打倒日本，並爲消滅東亞，更採取其殺戮行爲，漠觀正義人道，不擇手段，肆刑暴虐，於是菲律賓遂終於布告宣戰，蓋將彼等歷出東亞，歷出世界後，世界和平始能庶幾有望也。又最近後方國民之意志，已漸趨明朗，生產意慾亦日益發揚，國民對於增產之真正努力，已促成軍需生產值增強，後方國民如能具有此種氣魄與努力，則航空機及其他兵器之生產，自然可達到飛躍的增強，而其結果，將必可獲致消滅暴敵之偉大戰果，吾人若單就物量與敵方比較，則敵方所具有之力量，當數倍於日本，然而數量決不能決定戰爭之一切，蓋以寡敵眾之戰法，乃日軍專擅而特妙者，茍能善謀，則在數量上雖處劣勢，猶能制勝，此道實不勝枚舉，何況在日本技術創造日新月異之今日，即在數量上亦決不容悲觀也。防衛本土最後陣綫</p>
<p>今日敵人已攻至防衛日本本土之最後陣綫，但自吾人之立塲而觀，吾人刻已處於有利地位，敵愈迫近吾人之堅陣，吾人愈可使用活動基地之飛機，自各方面包圍敵人，而將其各個擊破，反之，敵人則苦於二重障碍，然吾人之戰略態勢，亦必須待飛機及其他兵器在質與量上得到相當程度之充實後，始能獲致充分之效果，時至今日，實爲吾仰體楠公出征湊川，獲持神之時，今日實爲吾人奮起先哲客服困難之鬥志，一億國民各盡職忠之時。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日美在菲律賓決戰已開始襲菲敵機墜毀廿餘架 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>○馬尼刺二十日中央社電　美軍十七日侵入菲律賓中部之雷伊泰灣後，菲律賓之日．美決戰即告開始，美第三艦隊開始進攻日本西南羣島及台灣前，曾宣揚此種攻擊爲進攻菲律賓前提作戰，其主要目的在使消弱台灣力量，一免其發揮太平洋第一綫要塞並西南太平洋航空重要基地之威力，然美軍輕視日軍空軍之威力及陸海軍基地之空軍力，乃至於進攻台灣之役蒙預料外之大損失，然美軍仍誤信作戰目的已完成半數，此則爲吾人當注意者。此次殲滅之威力，乃係能移動之航空要塞，其最大優點在能使用對艦隊或基地以各個擊破之戰術原則，日軍失守太平洋各島之［局部制空權］後，美軍遂據爲最大戰術之理由，然其第五十八機動部隊之泰半被殲滅後，太平洋上美軍進攻作戰之戰略戰術上之最大有利點，遂大部喪失。美軍戰略上之優點已犧牲，事實上在此決定日，美勝負自菲律賓決戰前，美軍戰略機動性之優勢已經喪失，爰菲律賓要塞內日軍之陸海空軍精銳已集結完畢，具有太平洋上無匹之戰鬥實力，不論美國此此爲正面進攻，抑係羅斯福競選前至進攻，日軍已早有準備。美軍前攻陷馬紹爾消耗砲彈炸彈十一萬五千噸，進攻台灣又犧牲艦艇四十五艘，再觀菲律賓要塞擁有多數之航空基地，多數只陸海軍精銳及十一萬平方公里之土地，美軍倘欲進攻，將有如何浩大之犧牲，今日似當有所覺悟。　　○馬尼刺二十日中央社電　敵機對菲律賓之襲擊，依然極爲執拗，十九日又有艦載機累計二百六十架，來襲馬尼刺地區外，並來襲克拉庫．菲爾特．克羅日．巴克耶特，伊羅伊羅等地。日基地部隊對之痛擊，擊落其十九架（內不確者七架），擊破其五架，日方損失極微。</p>
<h3 id="c5">台灣海戰果價值媲美珍珠灣海戰－日軍事專家伊藤氏談話 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>○東京二十日中央社電　日著名軍事專家伊藤正德氏，頃就台灣海面戰果發表談話，大意謂，日海軍於台灣東方海面之戰果，不論戰局係於何種階段，戰果之空前絕後，實足銘感。敵軍此次機動部隊之編成，係以空母爲中心，以戰艦爲其衛護，空母旣被日軍炸沉，敵海軍部隊即喪失中樞主力。按敵軍以空母爲主力艦，乃始於一九四二於所羅門海域之役，最近更顯然以空母駐於各戰艦之中央，以戰艦保護外圍，此次於告灣海面，予敵空母以重創，其價值與戰果，均足與珍珠灣海戰相媲美。其次於作戰之事件性觀之，前者係於開戰之初，即予敵當頭一棒，後者爲當國民勝戰慾望達於最高潮時，與敵主力以徹底打擊，故其適時性，亦可與其價值相提並論。又前者日軍係以上海空軍即艦載機造成打破世　界紀錄　之戰果後者則係利用航空基地，完成其偉大紀錄。其次於理智方面，又可證明日本能值戰術戰略，以日本現在生產，並以日陸海軍之相互協力與集中兵力，收獲此次偉大戰果之事，筆者對此事實不勝欣喜，原因此後勝利之條件已爲吾人所有，今後若能保持此種條件，自然可操勝券。敵軍雖以物量誇耀於人，兵員則極有限，一次海戰即損失經過訓練之兵士渝萬之眾，此於敵方當然非同小可，因篇幅限制，於此不能檢討敵軍敗戰原因，不勝遺憾，但最顯明者，厥爲敵軍於戰略戰術兩方面之用心錯誤，彼等竟忘却空母固有之弱點，於超過其利用限度時，必將暴露，遂至遭遇幾多失敗。敵欲掩飾此等弱點，自能再度與師進攻菲律賓，蓋其航空母艦勢力至今尚保有三分之二，但如再繼續展開攻勢，其所含胃險性極大，戰勝之褚條件旣已操於日本國民之手，自必使之發揚光大，而以堅確之信念，等待決戰時機之來臨。</p>
<h3 id="c6">爲台灣大捷王克敏廣播 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>○北平二十日中央社電　華北政務委員會委員長王克敏氏，以台灣方面盟邦收穫偉大戰果，特於昨日（十九日）下午七時四十分，作廣播演講，其大意謂：此次台灣東方海面海軍，持其數量龐大之機動部隊，企圖擾亂太平洋之安寧秩序，經盟邦軍隊加以徹底之攻擊後，使其挫折，望風披靡。日軍收穫此種對美海戰以來之空前戰果，吾人欣聞前方之捷報，除對前方將士表示敬意外，益堅必勝之信念。敵美此次遭受重創，戰意全失，今後恐更將一籌莫展。是故此次盟邦之勝利，不僅摧毀敵美之艦隊，並使敵美之戰意喪失，而獲得雙重勝利。當茲決戰年之期，盟軍偉大光榮戰果，佳音傳來，已顯示完成戰爭之徵兆，實爲吾人慶賀之事。</p>

<p>— 鶴齡</p>
<p>［據華盛頓來的報道，美國汽車工業的中心地第德洛，突然發生白人對黑人的衝突事件，歷史二十四小時以上，現出幾如內亂般的流血塲面，卒至軍隊出動，使用催淚彈與戰車，至二十二日晨始告鎮服。據警察當局的調查，死者二十五名（內黑人二十名），傷者七百名以上，以參加騷動嫌疑而逮捕者達千三百名以上（大部分爲黑人）。］（朝日新聞里斯本六月二十二日特電）暴動的案件</p>
<p>第德洛人口百六十萬，居有黑人十二萬人以上，爲美國第四大都會，福特，通用，克雷斯勒等大汽車工塲在焉。此等工塲其一部分現製造雙爲飛機和坦克的的黑人勞働者，爲數相當可觀。以前因爲居住問題及其他種種問題，黑白人之間，即已不斷的發生明爭暗鬥。有名的斯威夫特事件，也起於此。事緣黑人醫師斯威夫特，斥資一萬八千伍佰元，在第德洛市的某住宅區，購入漂亮的住宅一所。斯威夫特夫婦遷移新居，購備新的傢具，內外煥然一新，將欲安居，聯名要求該婦遷出。見其不應，白人等乃欲訴諸暴力，以達其目的。暴徒數百，在預定時間，　集於斯威夫特家附近的廣塲，一面大聲咒駡黑人，一面向該屋投擲瓦礫，破壞門窗玻璃。猶不以爲滿足，暴徒等闖入邸內，毀破傢具，撕裂窗簾，正在混亂時，槍聲突起，死暴徒一人，傷一人。參加暴動的巡查，趁此機會個別將斯威夫特夫婦拘禁於軍中。至警察署，經嚴属審訊俊，終以殺人罪起訴。此事件後由於芝加哥名律師克拉倫斯，達哥的義務辯護，斯威夫特夫婦宣告無罪，但對黑人壓迫，差別待遇，侮辱等事件，則迭有續出。人種的反感</p>
<p>美國對黑人之人種的反感，在美國的所謂再建時代　其端。南北戰爭時，被南軍的頑強抵抗與林肯總統的暗殺所激怒的北部人士，乘其勝利，將與一般白人同樣的投票權給與黑人。結果，南部黑人的政治上勢力，驟然增加，，南部白人乃分袂而起。乘此南部的混亂狀態，一部分專喜生事的不逞白人，大多從背部進入南部。因此，南部褚州戰敗後，愈形混亂，完全陷於不可收拾的狀態。政府乃派遣軍隊，從事恢復治安。南部的白人，迄今猶猛烈反對將當作奴隸使用的黑人與自己同等看待，這白人對黑人的反感，此後遂造成種種不人道事件。因此，黑人所受的迫害，似乎較奴隸時代更進一步。　　克．格賴克斯．克蘭德蜂起，即爲其一，而被稱美國特有的慘虐行爲私刑，也爲其一。這暴淚的惡劣行爲，由於美國人自身的反省，近來其件數大減，多的時候，一年間也不過二百回，從一八八五年至一九三二年的四十八年間，加於黑人的私刑計三千一百六十一件，加於白人的私刑爲九百八十五件，合計四千一百四十六件，莫視法律的不人道行爲，公然實施。由民眾加以私刑的塲合，乃犯人於逮捕後在拘留所等待法律制裁的時候，民眾破壞其拘留所，拖出犯人，或在犯人的護送途中掠奪犯人，處以私刑。是以那犯人究竟是不是真犯人，亦未決定，暴徒憑軍眾心理有此行爲。　　最近竟有綁在大樹上絞殺者，以前，將黑人綁在樹上，民眾一半是由於有趣，用獵槍和手槍射擊，見犯人的苦呻以爲樂。斷氣后，將其屍體鬆綁，切取手足反其他要部以爲嬉戲。又在某種塲合，將犯人處以火刑，見其苦態而稱快。黑人以前之被私刑者，大多是對白人女子凌辱或其他嫌疑。　　ＫＫＫ即白衣團，爲一把六六年在美國南部台納西州成立的秘密組織，會員遍佈全美。最初在防止黑人之政治的社會的進出之目的下組織的，後來對白人亦展其毒手，加以兇暴的制裁，近來其活動趨於靜止狀態。ＫＫＫ本來是喜葡教與猶太人的</p>

<p>○柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：莫斯科反軸心國參謀部談話舉行之後，蘇軍發動攻勢之兵力果已大增，布斯太平原蘇坦克車及軍隊，源源開至東普魯士邊境，敵數量上之優勢亦驟漸增加。北冀邊際之米美爾及羅森區戰事暫趨停頓，考那斯．史達羅波南公路兩側，大戰方酣。卡爾華耶與許爾溫特間之德戰綫向南北伸展，自米美爾直抵蘇發爾基。守衛東普魯士之德軍，屢次擊退蘇軍之進攻，敵始終未能深入德軍梯形陣地。維爾巴倫之蘇軍雖已入普魯士境，而佔領埃特戈能，然德軍主要防綫仍安然無恙，德生力軍且已出動，包圍突入之蘇軍。南路布斯太平原，索爾諾克．特勃萊森．格羅華頓之三角地帶內，坦克車會戰進行未已，雖結果未明，然敵人突入北方之原來計劃已告失敗矣。喀爾巴阡區德軍之撤退，在繼續進行中。　　○柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：貝爾格勒區現續在激戰中，蘇軍企圖擊潰德軍之反攻，戰事重心現移向南面，城內有巷戰，共黨遊擊隊異動失敗後，現亦參加巷戰，蘇軍突破德軍橋頭堡之企圖均予擊退，城內某部酣戰甚烈，尺寸領土均與力戰</p>

<p>○柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍事發言人指陳：若有人謂西綫有一戰事中心，則黑爾蒙特（Ｈｅｌｍｏｎｄ）一帶庶幾近之，美軍之深入此地，有爲大戰前奏之可能。亞琛局勢變化甚微，德軍在城邊保衛房舍，每一宅地咸盡力捍衛之，德軍仍力作反攻，企圖突破包圍亞琛之環境。　　又訊：亞琛方面敵軍，於該城自三面緩緩開入，已抵總車站，然市中心之德軍仍在抵抗中，城東北部美軍遭德軍反攻，被迫後退。</p>

<h3 id="c27">太平洋敵美作戰已陷入絕境松島部長昨發表談話 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（二十）日下午二時半，在報道常會席上，就敵美太平洋主力濱於全滅之危境，發表談話如次：敵美艦隊實力大損</p>
<p>敵美此次在太平洋上之蠢動，由南北兩方派遣兵力，北爲哈爾賽之第三艦隊主力，即所謂第五十八機動部隊，而南方則爲史波盎司之第五艦隊，該隊井具有相當有力之運勢船團。當初哈爾賽之艦隊，向琉球台灣之企圖，擬假此引誘日本聯合艦隊作戰，而南方史波盎司之第五艦隊，待哈爾賽艦隊之成功，擌一舉企圖推進至菲律賓。查北方哈爾賽艦隊自十二日至十八日間之作戰以來，其艦隊之被擊滅艦艇，損害達五十七艘以上，飛機損失總計一千架以上，人員之損失亦有三萬人以上，而敵之南方部隊，則亦受日本有力航空艦隊予以打擊，一部份已受頗大之損害。且查南方之敵兵力，較攻塞班島時，實力削弱，殊不堪一擊，按敵南北兩方之兵力集中，乃爲美全部海軍之百分之八十五，其餘一小部份，現盤桓於歐洲方面，此項艦隊兵力，較在太平洋上者爲遜，更</p>
<p>不能應用。惟今在太平洋上，雖能用之兵力，最多亦袛攻擊塞班島當時之兵力，僅袛四成而已。今後戰局異常重要</p>
<p>敵美艦隊之一部份，今後再雷伊泰灣作戰之如何困難，即可想像而知。美如今以塞班一役獲得體驗，認爲以航空母艦爲基地之空軍，較陸地爲基地之空軍有利，故今次行勢之變化，實因敵方空軍之航空母艦大部份喪失殆盡，再以菲律賓與塞班之面積相比，菲大於塞島多倍，同時日本之航空實力，超過敵美頗多。因此假定敵美對菲境有所企圖，定送死無疑。再如敵方前進基地之補充困難，既不能上進，退後又艱困，今後其中之戰局，當異常重要。深望中國人士，切勿迷惑敵美，應徹底協力完成作戰。況查敵美宣傳荒謬，又毫無次序，若美國民能洞悉真正戰況，今後均將逃避戰役，不能繼續作戰。茲據十八日紐約泰晤士報社論所稱，謂將來之印度，將成爲對日作戰之重要基地，於茲足見敵對太平洋之戰局，已日趨絕境矣。</p>
<h3 id="c28">國民論壇收音機的納費和收聽問題 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— 程維</p>
<p>近日各報都有關於收音機問題的來函，其內容大都係關於納費的問題。我是一個職業無綫電修理者，對於因收音機而發生的種種問題，見到的比較多一些，爰就所見所聞，檢討如下：　　一無綫電本爲教育和娛樂的工具，在平時若能運用得法，在近代文化上的功用可和電影相等，在在戰時亦未黨不如此。自大東亞戰爭發生以來，各民營電台相寜停閉，於是一般不堪人耳之詞，一些市憎之滑頭席告皆一掃而空，爲加強大東亞戰爭之最後勝利起見，遂有廣播協會之產生。它的用意不外爲喚起民眾對大東亞戰之認識，和勝利的自信心；但時至今日，並無若何的具體的宣傳和教育的播音，反產生一些低級的無謂的娛樂節目。　　二人民納稅固亦一種義務，廣播協會亦可說是一種公用事業的機關，和水電郵政等可同等看待，但別的公用事業的收費從沒有一年之內多加了十倍的費用只事發生，即使作一種稅收而論，一年內有如此巨額之差亦不多見吧。不論人民有無力量負擔，在節約增產之口號聲中，亦應有商討之餘地。　　三戰時對不正確之報道自應取締，早經當局聲明在先，並規定收聽範圍爲五五○千週至一五○○千週爲收聽之合法波段。但有些舊式收音機連本地電台都收不完全，而有五五○千週或一五○○千週以外的波段往往被廣播協會的外勤人員認作短波，加以查對和沒收。你若要繼續收聽的話，那就得由它們拿去改造。至於改造費並不是照廣播協會的二十五元收費，當然決不會少於二十五元的。更有些外勤人員，連無綫電常識都沒有的，它可以去查出些什麽呢！總之這都是利用公事上便利而行使不法行爲，廣播協會當局一定不知道，希望今後嚴加注意，切實改善，則民幸甚！</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Public Letter to Mr. Yujie: <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>It is a great pleasure to learn of your visit to China for inspection. Confucius said: "Is it not delightful to have friends coming from afar?" We share the same joy as Confucius in your tireless efforts and long journey. What we are delighted about, what we welcome, is that your visit is out of concern for China, especially concern for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Within China, besides the Nationalist Government in Nanjing, there are also the Chongqing government entrenched in the southwest and the Yan'an government entrenched in the northwest. These two political forces are undeniable facts. Therefore, objectively strengthening the Nationalist Government to create a national political center is indeed necessary. However, it is also necessary for the Nationalist Government to grant the people the minimum political demands. Otherwise, the people's tendencies will inevitably become more dispersed, and the Nationalist Government's power will inevitably be further reduced. There are two ways to strengthen the national government. One is internal, using talent only. It is undeniable that the current weakness of the national government is the lack of talent. The lack of central talent makes it difficult to exert leadership, which affects provincial and county-level politics. Because of the lack of talent, people generally lack political beliefs, and politics is not on track. The second is external. China's closest international relationship is naturally with Japan. Therefore, the national government's desire to strengthen itself is deeply connected to Japan's cooperation. We believe that since China and Japan are allies and have confidence in winning the Great East Asia War, after Japan implements its new policy toward China, and since the nation expects China to be independent and autonomous, the Chinese authorities should assume full responsibility for independence and autonomy. Except for military affairs and materials closely related to military affairs, which should be handled by Japan, the Chinese authorities should independently manage all political and economic measures that the Chinese authorities can manage. At the same time, the Japanese authorities should fully trust the Chinese government's ability to manage independently. In this regard, we have always believed that, except for military affairs, the less direct contact Japan has with the Chinese people, the better. In other words, the mission of the Nationalist Government should be to enable the people in the peaceful areas to improve their feelings towards Japan day by day, and thereby extend it to the whole country.</p>
<p>The current economic crisis in China has reached an extremely serious level. The Chinese people have always been accustomed to hard work and endurance, and they do not have excessive expectations. The past thirty years have been plagued by internal strife, and they have always endured it with forbearance. Especially in this war to liberate the East Asian nations and eliminate the Anglo-Americans, the people can endure all the pain that should be endured in wartime. However, in the past two years, the most contradictory phenomenon has been the disparity between the rich and the poor. The extremely wealthy have become wealthier, and the extremely poor have become poorer. The difference is too great, and both the extremely wealthy and the extremely poor cannot support the war. Those who can cooperate in the war are the general salaried class and intellectuals, but the lives of the salaried class and intellectuals have reached an extremely dangerous point. How to enable those who cooperate in the war to obtain the minimum living requirements is indeed the most important issue for the Chinese and Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Cooperating in the war, at the current stage in China, only means contributing materials, and the source of materials depends on production. If there is no production, the materials will inevitably run out. The Chinese people are not lazy. For the sake of life and to cooperate in the war, they are willing to work hard to produce. However, the essential elements of production are security, raw materials, power, and transportation. These items cannot be resolved at the current stage in China without Japan's genuine cooperation.</p>
<p>We have carefully observed that in the past two years, China has only regressed and not progressed in both politics and economics. From the people's perspective, we hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will earnestly reflect. If they cannot examine the failures and shortcomings of the past and seek a path to innovation, then we cannot ignore the greatest hidden crisis at present, which is the spread of the poisonous flames of communism. Therefore, to eliminate the poisonous bacteria of communism and reverse past policies, the most important thing is to ensure that political and economic measures take into account China's national conditions and the people's sentiments, so that we can gain the central support of the people.</p>
<p>You are a veteran of the political circles and an authority in the economic circles. This time you come to China, the expectations of the Chinese people are particularly deep. Standing in the position of the people, I dare to express my accumulated feelings and present them to you. I respectfully ask for your attention. I am very fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e2">Fierce Bombing of British Fleet by Japanese Aircraft off Nicobar Island; Four Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, and Destroyers Sunk <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 20th: On October 19, Japanese air units intercepted enemy British mobile forces attacking Car Nicobar Island in the Nicobar Islands. In the sea area south of the island, they sank one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaged one battleship and one destroyer.</p>
<p>O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The mobile force under Vice Admiral Ozawa, which arrived in the Indian Ocean, attacked the western sea area of Car Nicobar Island in the Eastern Nicobar Islands on the 7th (the day the Halsey Force invaded Leyte Gulf in the Philippines). On the 17th, 18th, and 19th, they repeatedly attacked with carrier-based aircraft and artillery fire. The Japanese air force immediately launched a fierce attack, sinking one aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaging one battleship and one destroyer. The progress of the battle is as follows: At around 9:00 AM on the 17th, more than 20 enemy aircraft attacked. At the same time, three enemy aircraft carriers, two battleships, three cruisers, and several destroyers appeared in the sea west of Nicobar Island. At 10:30 AM, they bombarded the Japanese airfield and harbor for more than two hours. After a fierce battle, the Japanese side shot down three of their ships. They appeared in the sea west of Nicobar Island and began bombarding the western coast of Nicobar Island for about an hour at 2:00 PM. At 9:30 AM on the 19th, enemy carrier-based aircraft and two battleships, two aircraft carriers, and three cruisers began bombarding Nicobar Island. They stopped the bombardment at around 12:00 PM and headed south. At around 12:00 PM, the Japanese air force launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet, resulting in the sinking of one enemy destroyer and one aircraft carrier. The Japanese air force hovered over the enemy aircraft carrier for a week and dropped more than ten bombs, all of which hit. The enemy aircraft carrier immediately emitted black smoke. At the same time, the middle of the ship was hit by two torpedoes launched by Japanese torpedo planes, so it was instantly surrounded by thick smoke and sank. In addition, Japanese aircraft damaged one battleship and one destroyer in the sea west of Nicobar Island. In the air battle, the enemy lost more than four aircraft.</p>

<p>O Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government and the Aid-the-War Society, in order to launch a major national movement to ensure victory in the decisive battle, aim to form a central headquarters for the national movement in the center. This is the first strategy of the powerful decisive victory movement, and in order to universally launch the movement to eliminate Britain and the United States, a national convention to destroy Britain and the United States was held by the central headquarters at the Tokyo Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM on the 20th. The meeting began at 1:00 PM, with Prime Minister Koiso, Minister of Home Affairs Odate, Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu, Minister of Justice Matsuzaka, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Shimada, Minister of the Army Sugiyama, Minister of the Navy Yonai, Minister of Health and Welfare Hirose, Minister of Finance Ishiwata, Secretary-General Ando, and other members from the government side, as well as Kobayashi, the head of the National Political Association, and other members in attendance. The meeting was presided over by Ando, the head of the Aid-the-War Society's group department. After the formalities were completed, Kinmitsu, the director-general of the Aid-the-War Society, delivered the opening address, followed by a speech by Koiso, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and President of the Aid-the-War Society. The content was full of the spirit of decisive victory and unwavering determination, and proclaimed to China and the world the steadfast belief in destroying the United States and Britain. Next, General Kobayashi Seizo, the President of the Aid-the-War Society, and Okada, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, successively delivered passionate speeches, revealing their firm belief in victory in the war. The meeting concluded at 3:00 PM. Seize the Initiative in the War</p>
<p>O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The main points of Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the National Convention are as follows: The decisive battle that the people have been waiting for has finally begun. The battle that will determine the future destiny of the country has begun. The great results obtained in the extremely short period of three or four days are rare examples in the history of warfare. No matter how much Britain and the United States boast about their wealth in material resources, they must feel deep pain from this damage. It goes without saying that many neutral countries and small countries in the Axis camp that are collapsing will find it difficult to quickly determine the disadvantage of the Axis side in the future development of the international political situation, given Japan's strength. In particular, the countries and peoples of Greater Asia will, due to this great victory, be even more aware of Japan's inevitable victory and the inevitable completion of Greater East Asia's construction. However, we compatriots must remember that this victory is the result of the prelude to the decisive battle. The real decisive battle begins from here. We can only respond to this fierce battle with an even more fierce battle, fighting directly until the enemy forces surrender. Only in this way can we seize the initiative in the war. Burma and the Philippines have both achieved independence and have been liberated from the shackles of Britain and the United States. As for East India, it will also achieve its long-awaited independence in the near future. In addition, we will provide full support, both materially and mentally, to the Provisional Government of Free India led by Chandra Bose, with the hope that the independence of India, which has been lost, can be restored in the near future. All these are manifestations of Japan's external spirit. Chinese and Japanese People Should Understand Each Other</p>
<p>Among the two major countries in East Asia, one is Japan and the other is the Republic of China. The fact that incidents have occurred between these two countries is due to the conspiracies of Britain and the United States. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese Incident can be said to be an unfortunate event on the road to establishing peace in East Asia. However, in China, due to the efforts of enlightened people such as Wang Jingwei, Japan's true intentions have been understood by the general public. Since the conclusion of a firm alliance with the National Government, the past temporary conflicts have instead made Sino-Japanese relations even stronger. Today, the two countries can cooperate with each other under the covenant of sharing life and death, and complete the Greater East Asia War. I am one who has a full understanding of the Chinese people's desire to achieve independence. The Japanese people may not have fully sympathized and understood the Chinese people. Although this is a difficult fact to deny, the Chinese people should also understand Japan and the Japanese people, and understand what the real obstacles to the revival of East Asia are. What Japan seeks from China is neither rights and interests, nor economic monopoly, nor the expansion of territory. What we hope for from China is that China will regain its due awareness as an East Asian nation, build an autonomous, independent, and truly powerful country, and become the core of East Asia alongside Japan, coexisting and co-prosperity, and contribute to the progress of East Asia. Therefore, Japan has first returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights to fulfill the Republic of China's long-standing wishes. Although Japanese troops are still fighting in China this month, this decisive battle is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army. Even the Chongqing army, which does not rely on British and American forces, is not regarded as an enemy. The Chongqing side not only failed to recognize the true enemy of China itself, but was instead manipulated by the true enemy, and launched a futile resistance against Japan, causing the true enemy to become more and more rampant. Regarding this point, I deeply regret it. At the same time, I sincerely hope that the Chinese people will quickly awaken from their dreams, think deeply about the true nature of the various incidents that have occurred continuously in East Asia, and immediately restore their awareness of reviving East Asia. The Will of the People in the Rear is Clear</p>
<p>The enemy is very anxious because the foundation of our revival of East Asia is becoming increasingly solid. They are pouring all their efforts into quickly defeating Japan and eliminating East Asia, and are taking murderous actions, disregarding justice and humanity, and resorting to all means to inflict tyranny and abuse. As a result, the Philippines finally declared war, because only by expelling them from East Asia and expelling them from the world can the world peace be expected to be realized. In addition, the will of the people in the rear has recently become clearer, and the desire for production is also increasing day by day. The people's genuine efforts to increase production have promoted the increase in the value of military production. If the people in the rear can have this kind of spirit and effort, the production of aircraft and other weapons will naturally achieve a leap forward increase, and as a result, they will be able to achieve the great result of eliminating the violent enemy. If we only compare the quantity with the enemy, the strength of the enemy is several times greater than that of Japan. However, quantity cannot determine everything in the war, because the tactic of fighting the few against the many is Japan's specialty and unique skill. If we can plan well, we can still win even if we are at a disadvantage in quantity. There are countless examples of this. Moreover, in today's Japan, where technological innovation is changing with each passing day, we should not be pessimistic even in terms of quantity. Defend the Last Line of Defense of the Homeland</p>
<p>Today, the enemy has attacked the last line of defense for defending the Japanese homeland, but from our standpoint, we are now in an advantageous position. The closer the enemy gets to our strong position, the more we can use aircraft from mobile bases to encircle the enemy from all sides and defeat them one by one. Conversely, the enemy is suffering from double obstacles. However, our strategic posture must wait until the aircraft and other weapons have been enriched to a considerable extent in terms of quality and quantity before we can achieve full results. Today is the time for us to look up to Kusonoki Masashige's expedition to Minatogawa and seize the moment of divine assistance. Today is the time for us to arouse the fighting spirit of our predecessors to overcome difficulties, and for 100 million people to do their duty faithfully.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Decisive Battle Between Japan and the United States in the Philippines Has Begun; More Than 20 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>O Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) – After the US military invaded Leyte Gulf in the central Philippines on the 17th, the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines began. Before the US Third Fleet began its attack on the southwestern Japanese islands and Taiwan, it declared that this attack was a preliminary operation for the invasion of the Philippines. Its main purpose was to weaken Taiwan's strength and avoid it exerting its power as the first-line fortress in the Pacific and an important aviation base in the southwestern Pacific. However, the US military underestimated the power of the Japanese air force and the air force strength of the army and navy bases, and suffered unexpected heavy losses in the attack on Taiwan. However, the US military still mistakenly believes that half of its operational objectives have been achieved, which is what we should pay attention to. The power of this annihilation is a mobile air fortress. Its greatest advantage is that it can use the tactical principle of defeating fleets or bases one by one. After the Japanese army lost [partial air control] over the Pacific islands, the US military used it as the greatest tactical reason. However, after most of its 58th Task Force was annihilated, the US military's greatest strategic and tactical advantage in offensive operations in the Pacific was largely lost. The US military's strategic advantage has been sacrificed. In fact, before the decisive battle between Japan and the United States in the Philippines was decided, the US military's strategic mobility advantage had already been lost. Therefore, the elite of the Japanese army, navy, and air force in the Philippine fortress have been completely assembled and have unparalleled combat strength in the Pacific. Whether the United States launches a frontal attack or Roosevelt launches an attack before the election, the Japanese army has long been prepared. The US military consumed 115,000 tons of shells and bombs in capturing the Marshalls, and sacrificed 45 ships in attacking Taiwan. Looking at the Philippine fortress, which has a large number of air bases, a large number of army and navy elites, and 110,000 square kilometers of land, how huge a sacrifice will the US military have to make if it wants to attack? Today, it seems that they should be aware of this. O Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft's attacks on the Philippines are still extremely stubborn. On the 19th, a total of 260 carrier-based aircraft attacked the Manila area, as well as Clark Field, Corregidor, Bakyet, Iloilo, and other places. The Japanese base units fiercely attacked them, shooting down 19 (including 7 unconfirmed) and damaging 5. Japanese losses were minimal.</p>
<h3 id="e5">The Value of the Taiwan Sea Battle is Comparable to the Pearl Harbor Sea Battle – Talk by Japanese Military Expert Ito <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>O Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The well-known Japanese military expert Ito Masanori recently gave a speech on the results of the sea battle off Taiwan, the gist of which was that the Japanese navy's achievements in the sea area east of Taiwan, no matter what stage the battle situation is in, are unprecedented and worthy of commemoration. The enemy's formation of the mobile force this time was centered on aircraft carriers and protected by battleships. After the aircraft carriers were sunk by the Japanese army, the enemy naval force lost its central main force. According to the enemy's use of aircraft carriers as the main battleship, which began in 1942 in the Solomon Sea battle, it has recently become more obvious to station aircraft carriers in the center of each battleship and use battleships to protect the periphery. This time, in the waters off Taiwan, the enemy aircraft carriers were severely damaged, and their value and results are comparable to the Pearl Harbor sea battle. Secondly, from the perspective of the eventuality of the operation, the former gave the enemy a head-on blow at the beginning of the war, and the latter thoroughly struck the enemy's main force when the people's desire to win the war reached its climax. Therefore, its timeliness can also be compared with its value. In addition, in the former, the Japanese army used the Shanghai air force and carrier-based aircraft to create a world record. The latter used the aviation base to complete its great record. Secondly, in terms of rationality, it can also prove that Japan is capable of tactical and strategic warfare. With Japan's current production and the mutual cooperation and concentration of forces between the Japanese army and navy, the fact that this great result was achieved makes the author very happy. The conditions for future victory are already in our possession. If we can maintain these conditions in the future, we can naturally be sure of victory. Although the enemy boasts of its material quantity, its soldiers are extremely limited. A sea battle can lose tens of thousands of trained soldiers, which is of course no small matter for the enemy. Due to space limitations, I cannot review the reasons for the enemy's defeat here, which is a pity, but the most obvious thing is that the enemy's intentions in both strategy and tactics were wrong. They have forgotten the inherent weakness of aircraft carriers, and when they exceed their limits of use, they will inevitably be exposed, and they will encounter many failures. The enemy wants to cover up these weaknesses and can re-launch an attack on the Philippines, because its aircraft carrier power still retains two-thirds, but if it continues to launch an offensive, the inherent risk is extremely high. Since the conditions for victory have been grasped by the Japanese people, we must promote them and wait for the opportunity for a decisive battle to come with a firm belief.</p>

<p>O Beiping, 20th (Central News Agency) – Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, gave a radio speech at 7:40 PM yesterday (the 19th) because the Allied forces in Taiwan had achieved great results. The gist of the speech was: This time, the navy in the eastern sea of Taiwan, with its large mobile force, attempted to disrupt the peace and order of the Pacific. After being thoroughly attacked by the Allied forces, it was frustrated and collapsed. The Japanese army has achieved unprecedented results in this naval battle against the United States. We are delighted to hear the news of the victory in the front and, in addition to expressing our respect to the officers and soldiers in the front, we are more determined in our belief in victory. The enemy United States has suffered heavy losses this time, and its will to fight has been completely lost. In the future, it may be even more helpless. Therefore, this victory of the Allied forces not only destroyed the fleet of the enemy United States, but also made the enemy United States lose its will to fight, and won a double victory. In this year of decisive battle, the great and glorious results of the Allied forces and the good news have shown signs of completing the war, which is a matter of celebration for us.</p>
<h3 id="e7">The Ministry of Finance Adopts Reasonable Countermeasures to Stabilize Finance and Commodity Prices Among Financial Institutions <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>○Nanjing, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The National Government's financial authorities, in order to curb commodity prices and stabilize finance as urgent wartime measures, have been actively working and repeatedly adjusting for several years. Recently, however, the rise in various commodity prices has been fierce, leading to unstable financial fluctuations, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. The Ministry of Finance authorities, recognizing this, have adopted reasonable countermeasures. Given that Shanghai is the center of our country's finance, they will start with Shanghai to clear its source. In accordance with Article 12 of the Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions by the Ministry of Finance, a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality has been specifically defined. It is predicted that after the implementation of this framework, Shanghai's finance will move onto the right track and become stable. At the same time, general speculative trading can also be eliminated, and commodity prices will not be unduly stimulated, leading to endless increases. Commodity prices in various regions can also be curbed as a result, and people's livelihoods can be stabilized. The remarks of Finance Minister Zhou and the framework for the operations of financial institutions are recorded below: [L Finance Minister Zhou's Remarks&gt;</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance made the following remarks regarding the formulation of a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality: [An investigation into curbing commodity prices and stabilizing finance reveals that these are urgent wartime policy measures. The Ministry has been working hard and adjusting its efforts in stages. Recently, commodity prices have been rising more rapidly. Shanghai is the center of our country's finance. To implement the above-mentioned countermeasures, it is necessary to start with Shanghai to clear its source. Therefore, fifteen articles of a framework for strengthening the operations of financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality have been specifically formulated for implementation. The main points of this framework are as follows: 1. Regulations are established to distinguish the amount of deposits of financial institutions and set standards. Those who fail to meet the prescribed amount will be allowed to increase capital or merge, so that both their own interests and the strengthening of policy implementation can be taken into consideration. 2. Regulations stipulate that the deposit payment reserve shall be 30% to ensure their payment ability. 3. Restrictions on loans are imposed to prevent speculation or hoarding. All accounting books should also be handled in accordance with regulations. Important staff must have considerable qualifications. After the promulgation of this framework, it is hoped that all financial institutions in the Shanghai Special Municipality will understand the content and earnestly comply with it to assist the government and fulfill their respective responsibilities, so that the use of funds can be brought onto the right track. In this way, even if commodity prices rise due to wartime supply shortages, they will not be unduly stimulated and rise endlessly, and finance will also be stabilized. The benefits will be significant, and all relevant parties will be optimistic about its success. As for financial institutions in other regions, the Ministry will consider the situation and stipulate procedures for implementation at any time, in order to strengthen them consistently and achieve complete success through one trend.

<p>— He Ling</p>
<p>[According to reports from Washington, a conflict between whites and blacks suddenly occurred in Detroit, the center of the American automobile industry. The conflict lasted for more than 24 hours, resulting in a bloody scene resembling a civil war. Finally, the army was dispatched, using tear gas and tanks, and the situation was only subdued on the morning of the 22nd. According to the police authorities' investigation, 25 people died (including 20 blacks), more than 700 people were injured, and more than 1,300 people were arrested for allegedly participating in the riot (mostly blacks).] (Asahi Shimbun, Lisbon Special Dispatch, June 22) Cases of Riot</p>
<p>Detroit has a population of 1.6 million, including more than 120,000 blacks. It is the fourth largest metropolis in the United States, with major automobile factories such as Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler located there. A considerable number of black laborers in these factories are now manufacturing airplanes and tanks for the war. In the past, disputes between blacks and whites have continuously occurred due to housing problems and other issues. The famous Swift incident also originated here. It began when a black doctor, Swift, spent 18,500 yuan to purchase a beautiful house in a residential area of Detroit. When Dr. and Mrs. Swift moved into their new home and furnished it with new furniture, both inside and out, the whites demanded the Swifts moved out. When Swift refused, the whites resorted to violence to achieve their goals. Hundreds of rioters gathered in a square near the Swift's home at the appointed time, shouting curses at blacks and throwing rubble at the house, damaging doors and windows. Not satisfied with this, the rioters broke into the house, destroying furniture and tearing curtains. In the midst of the chaos, gunshots suddenly rang out, killing one rioter and wounding another. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the patrolling police officers arrested Dr. and Mrs. Swift separately and detained them in the army camp. After strict interrogation at the police station, they were eventually charged with murder. After this incident, thanks to the pro bono defense of Clarence Darrow, a famous lawyer from Chicago, Dr. and Mrs. Swift were declared innocent. However, incidents of oppression, discrimination, and insult against blacks have continued to occur. Racial Animosity</p>
<p>The racial animosity of Americans toward blacks originated in the so-called Reconstruction Era in the United States. During the Civil War, the Northerners, angered by the South's stubborn resistance and the assassination of President Lincoln, took advantage of their victory to grant blacks the same voting rights as whites. As a result, the political power of blacks in the South increased sharply, and the Southern whites rose up in opposition. Taking advantage of the chaotic state of the South, some troublemaking whites, mostly from the North, entered the South. As a result, the southern states became increasingly chaotic after the defeat, falling into a completely unmanageable state. The government then dispatched troops to restore order. The whites in the South still vehemently oppose treating the blacks they used as slaves as equals, and this animosity toward blacks has since led to various inhumane incidents. Therefore, the persecution suffered by blacks seems to be even more severe than in the slave era. The Ku Klux Klan's uprising is one example, and the uniquely American act of atrocity known as lynching is another. Due to the self-reflection of the Americans themselves, the number of these violent and heinous acts has decreased significantly in recent years, but even in the most frequent years, there were only about 200 cases a year. From 1885 to 1932, over 48 years, a total of 3,161 lynchings were carried out against blacks and 985 against whites, for a total of 4,146 cases. These inhumane acts that disregarded the law were carried out openly. In cases of lynching by the mob, after the offender was arrested and awaiting legal sanctions in the detention center, the mob would destroy the detention center, drag the offender out, or seize the offender during the escort and carry out the lynching. Therefore, even if it was not decided whether the offender was a true offender, the mob acted on mob psychology. Recently, there have even been cases of people being tied to large trees and strangled to death. In the past, blacks were tied to trees, and the crowd, partly for amusement, would shoot at them with shotguns and pistols, taking pleasure in the victim's groans. After death, the body was untied, and hands, feet, and other essential parts were cut off for sport. In some cases, the offender was burned alive, and the crowd cheered at their suffering. In the past, blacks who were lynched were mostly accused of raping white women or other crimes.</p>
<p>The KKK, or Ku Klux Klan, is a secret organization founded in 1866 in Tennessee, in the southern United States. Its members are spread throughout the United States. It was initially organized with the purpose of preventing blacks from advancing politically and socially, but later it extended its reach to whites, carrying out violent sanctions. In recent years, its activities have tended to be quiescent. The KKK was originally anti-Catholic and anti-Jewish.</p>

<p>○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: After the Moscow anti-Axis staff talks were held, the Soviet forces launching the offensive have indeed greatly increased. Soviet tanks and troops from the Puszta plains are continuously arriving at the East Prussian border, and the enemy's numerical advantage is also gradually increasing. The fighting in the Mēmelė and Raseiniai regions on the northern edge has temporarily stalled, while fierce battles are raging on both sides of the Kaunas-Stalobolonaya highway. The German front line between Kalvarija and Širvintos extends north and south, from Mēmelė to Suwałki. The German troops defending East Prussia have repeatedly repelled Soviet attacks, and the enemy has consistently failed to penetrate deeply into the German echeloned defenses. Although Soviet troops from Virbalis have entered Prussian territory and occupied Eitkūnai, the main German defense line remains intact, and German reinforcements have been dispatched to encircle the penetrating Soviet troops. On the southern Puszta plains, tank battles are ongoing in the Satornoujhely-Trebišov-Grossewardein triangle. Although the outcome is unclear, the enemy's original plan to penetrate the north has failed. The German retreat in the Carpathian region is continuing.</p>
<p>○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues in the Belgrade area. Soviet troops are attempting to crush the German counterattack, and the focus of the fighting has now shifted to the south. There are street battles in the city, and communist guerrillas, after their failed insurrection, are now also participating in the street battles. The Soviet attempts to break through the German bridgehead have all been repelled. Fierce fighting is raging in certain parts of the city, with every inch of territory being fiercely contested.</p>

The war of today must have an end one day, and whether our nation can thereby gain freedom or become the slave of others depends on whether our country can win. If we unfortunately lose the war, we will never be able to raise our heads again, because sovereignty is a prerequisite for the survival of a country. The enemy makes no secret of its goals. Although the Soviet Union and the Anglo-Americans use different means, their purpose is the same: to enslave the German nation forever.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Helmond Becomes the Focus of Western Front Fighting, German Counterattack Near Aachen <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out: If there is a focus of fighting on the Western Front, then the Helmond area is perhaps the closest. The American penetration into this area may be a prelude to a major battle. The situation in Aachen has changed little. German troops are defending houses on the outskirts of the city, and every plot of land is being defended with all their might. German troops are still launching counterattacks, attempting to break through the encirclement of Aachen.</p>
<p>Another report: Enemy troops in the Aachen area are slowly entering the city from three sides and have reached the main train station. However, German troops in the city center are still resisting. American troops in the northeast of the city were forced to retreat by a German counterattack.</p>
<h3 id="e13">New British Landing Attempt in Dutch Territory <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting continues at the mouth of the Scheldt River. The First Canadian Army was unable to gain a favorable position on Wednesday, either in the Breskens area or on the Beveland Peninsula. On the Tholen-Tilburg highway, Canadian forces are also increasing pressure. The main force of the British Second Army is still in the Nijmegen area. Its extreme right wing, after occupying Venray, is advancing towards the German bridgehead on the Maas River. Looking at the Dutch battlefield, the enemy has been attacking Antwerp for a long time without success, and the general offensive of the British Second Army has been delayed for too long. With the imminent start of adverse weather conditions, the enemy may temporarily abandon the fighting at the mouth of the Scheldt River and land near Rotterdam or Amsterdam instead. At the same time, they will launch a general offensive on land to support each other. The American First Army will also participate in this general offensive. The American attack on Maastricht the day before yesterday may have been a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Moscow Conference Concludes, British Prime Minister on His Way Home <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>○Berlin, 20th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Huitong News Agency reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that the Moscow Conference may have concluded yesterday, and even Churchill is already on his way home. Regarding rumors that Churchill intends to return to Rome from Moscow, the spokesman believes that it is closer for Churchill to return directly to London, as Churchill will deliver a speech in the House of Commons this week on the Moscow Conference. The spokesman then answered a question regarding the relationship between the Anglo-Americans and the Soviet Union, stating that during the war, the internal disputes within the anti-Axis powers would certainly not become public. Given this statement, it seems that the Kremlin's position is not as solid as expected, so Stalin may have made some concessions. In short, the main goal of the anti-Axis powers is to weaken Germany, and their internal disputes will be postponed until after the war. At the current stage of the war, only military decisions are possible, and Germans know that this definition cannot be avoided.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Detour for Vehicles During Air Defense Training, Air Defense Headquarters Issues Traffic Guidelines <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command recently issued a statement regarding vehicles passing through air defense training sites, stating: [During repeated civilian air defense training exercises, vehicles with special traffic permits or vehicles belonging to various air defense teams have repeatedly rushed through the fire prevention, rescue, and evacuation sites at extremely high speeds, much to the regret of the civilian air defense workers. At this time, when military officers and civilians are working together to establish a winning posture, this situation should be deeply considered by those concerned. From now on, the following matters should not be carried out, and cooperation from the military is also hoped for. 1. Vehicles with special traffic permits and vehicles belonging to air defense teams should not rush through training sites directly but should detour. 2. Civilian air defense organizations should pre-mark white lines to allow pedestrians to know the training locations in advance. 3. If there is no detour, except for unavoidable events, passage should be waited for until after the end of training. ]</p>
<h3 id="e17">The New Federation and Two Other Groups Pre-Celebrate the Lecture Convention, to Be Held Consecutively for Three Days Starting Today <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has exerted its martial prowess, repeatedly defeated the British and Americans, and advanced toward victory. However, the enemy Americans do not realize this and still hope to reverse the decline. Recently, in order to seek re-election as president, Roosevelt did not hesitate to mobilize troops and blindly attacked Taiwan. Fortunately, the bravery of the Japanese soldiers completely annihilated the main force of the American Pacific Fleet, thereby laying a foundation for certain victory. The news spread, and the entire nation was delighted. The Shanghai Press Federation, the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, and the Civic Welfare Association, in order to awaken the people of the country and concentrate their total strength to completely eliminate the British and Americans, have scheduled a "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention" to be held continuously for three days starting today (every afternoon at 2:50) at the Grand Theater. Three-Day Program</p>
<p>On the first day, Colonel Matsushima, head of the Fleet Reporting Department, and Chen Binhe, a standing member of the Municipal Advisory Committee, will speak, and the Chinese film "Reunion" will be shown. On the second day (22nd), Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Chinese Naval Academy, and Captain Iida of the Naval Attaché Office will be the main speakers, and "Reunion" will continue to be shown. On the third day (23rd), the lectures will be given by Lieutenant Colonel Izubuchi, head of the Army Reporting Department, and Huang Jingzhai, a director of the Press Federation and chairman of the month. Music and songs will be performed by the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, and famous Chinese and Japanese singers will sing. Admission tickets to the convention are all non-sale items. Institutions and organizations that wish to participate may prepare an official letter and request them from the Shanghai Press Federation at 160 Great Shanghai Road (from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM today). However, for the sake of limitation, each unit is limited to five tickets, until they are given out. Furthermore, the original name of the "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention" was "Civic Viewing and Celebrating the Great Victory on the Taiwan Sea Lecture Convention." Now, because the results of the war are gradually expanding and good news is constantly coming, the "Great Victory on the Taiwan Sea" numbers are not enough to express the meaning of its complete victory, so it has been specially renamed the "Sweep Away the Anglo-American Fleet Pre-Celebration Convention."</p>

<h3 id="e20">Security Command Captures Kidnappers <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Recently, in the Datuan township area of Nanhui, under the jurisdiction of this city, the Special Task Force of the pseudo-bandit Zhu Yamin, led by Wang Ziying, has been hiding, specializing in kidnapping and extortion, harming the local area. In early September, Song Linmei, the owner of the Song Dingti pressing factory, a wealthy merchant in Datuan, was kidnapped by this bandit group. After being kidnapped, Zhu, within the bandit group, signed checks from Hongchang &amp; Xie and United Shenzhuang in this city, totaling more than five million yuan in national currency, to be used as ransom. This matter was discovered by the investigation team of the Municipal Security Command, which immediately sent personnel to wait and investigate at Hongchang &amp; Xie and United Shenzhuang. As expected, on September 25th, a pseudo-bandit named Zhang Jinfu went to Hongchang &amp; Xie to cash four checks totaling 200,000 yuan. He was immediately arrested and interrogated. According to his confession, he was a soldier in the Special Task Force of the pseudo-bandit Zhu Yamin, and the checks were distributed by the leader Wang Ziying in the kidnapping case of Song Linmei. In addition to the suspect being sent to the military court for trial, orders have been given to continue secretly investigating and arresting the remaining fugitives to eliminate the harm to the people. Furthermore, there are still a large number of checks signed by the victim Song Linmei in this case (including amounts of 5,000, 10,000, and 50,000, but most are for 10,000 yuan), scattered around Datuan in Nanhui and Fengxian, being used as chips. It is hoped that merchants and residents in various places will refuse to use them to avoid being implicated.</p>

Requests for assistance have been made to relevant authorities to improve the lives of police officers.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Flour and Wheat Control Committee Selects 32 Flour Mills to Operate <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce Control Council believes that the mission of wartime industry is to gather all efforts with limited raw materials to achieve maximum efficiency and collaboratively complete group strategies. The flour milling facilities of its affiliated factories total 46,064 accumulating hours. According to this year's procurement plan, the required milling capacity is estimated at 25,323 accumulating hours, only 54.9% of the total capacity of all factories, indicating a significant surplus in factory capacity. After a thorough review of each factory's milling performance, electricity consumption, and geographical conditions, the committee has decided that starting in October, within four months, according to the adjustment plan, 32 factories will be selected to continue operating, while the remaining factories will temporarily cease operations to save resources and facilitate reorganization. The committee will provide maintenance fees to the closed factories to cover daily expenses. These factories should constantly maintain and improve their facilities to be ready for operation if designated. Factories that cannot operate due to various reasons or those with outstanding procurement performance exceeding the planned quantity may immediately resume operations without interruption. It is reported that the closed factories after the reorganization include: in the Shanghai area, Fuchang Old Factory, Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Dongfu Factory, Huayou Qiangshen Factory, and No. 32 and No. 4 Factories; in the Wuxi area, Anfu Factory, Huada Old Factory, Huada New Factory, and Huajiucheng Factory; in the Changzhou area, Zhaozhou Factory; and in the Hupou area, Gaoyou Factory and Xinfu Factory, totaling twelve factories.</p>

In addition to increasing the wages of street sweepers to ensure they can work with peace of mind, yesterday morning (the 20th), the cleaning section chief Cao Zhiming led inspectors and foremen to clear garbage along Zhonghua Republic Road in Nanshi. They are scheduled to depart again at 8:00 AM tomorrow (the 22nd) to continue the work.</p>

<p>Following the frequent reports of the triumphant victory of the valiant Japanese Navy in the waters east of Taiwan, annihilating the enemy's Pacific main fleet, the people of East Asia are all exhilarated. To reaffirm their determination to eliminate the enemy Anglo-Americans, the Japanese residents of this city, our allied nation, held a "Total Pursuit and Elimination of the Enemy Pacific Fleet" lecture at the Hongkou International Theater at 6:30 PM yesterday (the 20th). A large number of Japanese residents attended enthusiastically. Speakers included the head of the Matsushima Fleet Reporting Department and Consul General Yano, with the theme "The Divine Opportunity Has Arrived, the Time to Eliminate the Enemy." The audience was visibly inspired.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The Enemy American Operation in the Pacific Has Fallen into a Dead End: Statement by Department Chief Matsushima Yesterday <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon (the 20th) at 2:30 PM, Department Chief Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department of our allied nation Japan in Shanghai, made the following statement at the regular press conference regarding the perilous situation of the enemy American Pacific main force: The enemy American fleet's strength is greatly diminished.</p>
<p>The recent movements of the enemy Americans in the Pacific involved deploying forces from both the north and the south. The northern force was Halsey's Third Fleet main force, also known as Task Force 58, while the southern force was Spruance's Fifth Fleet, which also possessed a considerably strong transport fleet. Initially, Halsey's fleet aimed to lure the Japanese Combined Fleet into battle with its attacks on Okinawa and Taiwan, while the southern Spruance Fifth Fleet, after Halsey's fleet succeeded, attempted to advance to the Philippines in one fell swoop. Since the fighting from the 12th to the 18th, Halsey's fleet has suffered losses of over 57 ships and over 1,000 aircraft, with personnel losses exceeding 30,000. The enemy's southern force has also been attacked by the powerful Japanese air fleet and has suffered considerable damage. Moreover, the strength of the enemy's southern force is weaker than it was during the attack on Saipan, making it easy to defeat. The combined forces of the enemy in the north and south account for 85% of the entire American navy, with the remaining small portion stationed in Europe. This fleet is inferior to the one in the Pacific and even less capable. The maximum force that can be used in the Pacific is only 40% of the force used to attack Saipan at that time. The future war situation is extremely important.</p>
<p>It is imaginable how difficult it will be for part of the enemy American fleet to operate in Leyte Gulf in the future. The Americans, having learned from the Battle of Saipan, believe that air power based on aircraft carriers is more advantageous than air power based on land. However, the current shift in momentum is due to the fact that the enemy's air force has lost most of its aircraft carriers. Furthermore, the Philippines is many times larger than Saipan, and Japan's air power exceeds that of the enemy Americans by a considerable margin. Therefore, if the enemy Americans attempt to invade the Philippines, they will undoubtedly be sending themselves to their deaths. Additionally, the difficulty in replenishing the enemy's forward bases means that they cannot advance or retreat easily. The future war situation is extremely important. It is deeply hoped that the Chinese people will not be misled by the enemy Americans and should thoroughly cooperate to complete the war effort. Moreover, the enemy American propaganda is absurd and disorganized. If the American people could understand the true war situation, they would avoid battle and be unable to continue the war. According to an editorial in the New York Times on the 18th, India will become an important base for operations against Japan in the future, which shows that the enemy's war situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly desperate.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Radio Subscription Fees and Reception Issues on National Radio Forums <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Wei</p>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have received letters regarding radio issues, mostly concerning subscription fees. As a professional radio repairman, I have seen more of the various problems that arise from radios. I will examine what I have seen and heard below: First, radio is a tool for education and entertainment. If used properly in peacetime, its function in modern culture can be comparable to that of movies, and this is no different during wartime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, various private radio stations have been suspended, and uncouth language and market slang have been swept away. To strengthen the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, the Broadcasting Association was established. Its purpose is to awaken the public's awareness of the Greater East Asia War and confidence in victory. However, to this day, there has been no concrete propaganda or educational broadcasting, but rather some low-level, pointless entertainment programs have been produced. Second, it is the duty of the people to pay taxes. The Broadcasting Association can also be said to be a public utility, which can be regarded as the same as water, electricity, and postal services. However, other public utilities have never increased their fees tenfold within a year. Even as a form of taxation, it is rare to see such a huge difference within a year. Regardless of whether the people have the capacity to bear it, there should be room for discussion under the slogan of saving and increasing production. Third, incorrect reporting during wartime should be banned, as the authorities have stated in advance, and it is stipulated that the reception range should be 550 kHz to 1500 kHz as the legal reception band. However, some old-fashioned radios cannot receive all local stations, and wavebands outside of 550 kHz or 1500 kHz are often regarded as shortwave by the field personnel of the Broadcasting Association, who check and confiscate them. If you want to continue listening, they will have to take it away for modification. The modification fee is not the 25 yuan charged by the Broadcasting Association, and will certainly not be less than 25 yuan. Moreover, some field personnel have no radio knowledge at all. What can they find out? In short, this is all about using the convenience of public office to carry out illegal activities. The Broadcasting Association authorities certainly do not know this. I hope that they will pay close attention to this in the future and make practical improvements, which will be a great blessing to the people!</p>

<p>Yesterday, an anonymous person donated funds to support various projects of this office, including 10,000 yuan each for elementary school teacher medical assistance funds, poverty relief funds, orphans' assistance funds, and midwifery funds. Additionally, Mr. Zhong generously donated 10,000 yuan to the elementary school teacher medical assistance fund, benefiting the poor. We are deeply grateful. Recently, this office has frequently received applications from elementary school teachers, or their families, for medical assistance funds, often due to pulmonary diseases, requiring significant expenses and long-term hospitalization. The lives of elementary school teachers are originally the most difficult. How can we not offer assistance when they are suffering in bed? Especially since recent medical expenses are very high, the need for funds is particularly urgent. We hope that people from all walks of life will show compassion, enthusiastically contribute, and continuously donate, so that teachers will benefit. How small will the benefit be? Yinzai Master's Gathering Postponed.</p>
<p>In order to promote learning and art and promote noble entertainment, Yinzai Master originally scheduled a gathering on Sunday, October 22nd, from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM, at the Xilu Yejing Temple on Pinlang Road, Gordon Road.

Shanghai Zheshao Hospital Donates Free Medical Vouchers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zheshao Hospital was established through donations from fellow Zhejiang and Shaoxing natives. It has been in operation for two years. Initially, it was intended to provide convenient medical treatment for fellow natives. This year, Western medicine has been added, and anyone can be admitted, regardless of their origin. Recently, in light of the high cost of Western medicine and the rising cost of living, which causes many poor families to delay medical treatment due to financial constraints, 20 free medical vouchers have been prepared and entrusted to this office to be donated to the poor and sick. We will certainly do so and express our gratitude. Midwifery Associations Plan to Establish a Civilian Obstetrics Hospital.</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Midwives Association of this city has been making every effort to advance the work of the association. With the support of Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Boyuan, and Chu Gongzan, plans are underway to establish a civilian medical hospital, which will provide free delivery services to extremely poor women. The location is currently being selected, and plans are underway to establish it as soon as possible. Lecture</p>

<h3 id="e35">Generous Donations to the Home for the Aged <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>○ Target: 5,000,000 yuan ○ Deadline: November 10th ○ Collection Point: This Newspaper's Social Services Department</p>
<p>The Shanghai Home for the Aged, due to financial difficulties, has launched a fundraising campaign with a one-month target. In the past ten days, it has received enthusiastic support from the community. As of yesterday, donations exceeding one million yuan have been received, benefiting the population, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>However, the target for this fundraising is five million yuan, and only one-fifth has been reached so far, leaving a significant gap. Considering the recent surge in prices, assistance is even more urgent. Therefore, we sincerely hope that benevolent individuals in society will continue their efforts and expand their donations. If with the help of all sectors of society, the elderly can be spared from cold and hunger, it would be an immeasurable virtue. Donation Report:</p>

<p>— By Iwata Yu, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>[Without notifying her family, she actually ran away.] Ryufu was greatly surprised when he heard his younger sister say this.</p>
<p>(This fellow is copying my old habits again. Really, I can't handle her.) [You want to go to dressmaking school? Or a women's university? Father and mother will definitely agree!] Ryufu said angrily, but his younger sister simply offered a lonely smile without answering.</p>
<p>Thinking of his parents' worries, Ryufu unhesitatingly took off his formal attire and rushed to the telegraph office to send a telegram to his parents. When he returned, he saw that his younger sister was already wearing mourning black. [I'm going to attend the memorial service for the martyrs. You wait here for a while!] After Ryufu said this, his younger sister quietly said: [You're going too.] [Yes.] His younger sister's voice had an irresistible strength. (Oh, there's no way around it!)</p>
<p>Ryufu was planning to attend the family seats as a true friend of the deceased. So what if he went with his younger sister? At the same time, letting his younger sister wander around the streets of Tokyo on her own was not a solution. [You're really impossible! In that case, let's both attend the general memorial service! Hurry and get ready!] Ryufu said angrily. [Yes, I'll get ready right away. Let's go then!] Zhimei took off her jewelry and readjusted her black mourning dress.</p>
<p>The two immediately left. Since they were attending the general public seating area, it would definitely be very crowded, so they had to get to Hibiya early. Zhimei lightly lifted her purse, her hips swaying as she followed behind her brother. You couldn't tell she was a girl from faraway Kagoshima; her Western clothes were quite fashionable. Looking at this, Ryufu felt even more irrationally angry.</p>
<p>He stormed onto the streetcar, got on the bus, and didn't say a word to his younger sister. When they arrived in Hibiya, people were just starting to gather. Because Ryufu had inquired about the procession route within the Navy, he went to the Sakaimon gate facing Uchisaiwaicho to find a spot, as the procession would pass there on its way to the cemetery inside the park.</p>
<p>Zhimei sat down on the cement pavement, and Ryufu stood behind her. In the warm and sunny weather, the number of people was increasing minute by minute. (153)</p>
