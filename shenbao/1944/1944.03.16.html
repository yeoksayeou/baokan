<h3 id="c1">社評讀德富翁「閑話時局」後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>德富蘇峯先生，是盟邦日本新聞界的元老，道德文章，望重一時，最近他在日本每日新聞報發表「閑話時局」一文，極有價値。本報特為譯出分日轉載（見今日第二版）。德富先生的話，都是對日本朝野國民，所作很坦白率直的勉勵。我們並不是恭維日本，同時也不是糟蹋自己。無論從政治經濟文化等等措施，以至於社會現象，　民生活等等，就日本和中國兩相比衡，無疑是中國落後得多了。然而，我們　了德富先生的文章，他尙且對於　本現狀，　格批評，反觀我們的現狀，我們的批評　以至所得的反響，誠使我們更加引為愧作。</p>
<p>韓退之說：：「古之君子，其責己也重以周。其待人也輕以約。重以周，故不　　輕以約，故人樂為善。　因為「責己」能「重以周　，所以，對於自己的　切，就能「不怠」。也就是「律己嚴」的意思。德富先生資備自己國家「重以周　，以期喚起國人的「不怠」情緒。同時，他們朝野國人聽了他的勸勉，決不致於嫌討厭吧　這樣「不掩飾」，「不裝點門面」的坦白態　，更使我們自形愧作。</p>
<p>我們認為穗富先生的話，實際上都是我們中國人士應該接受的。於此，我們特加申引如次：</p>
<p>他說：「口頭上只是講非常時期，非常時期，而行為却依然故我，幾與承平時代無異。」這是我們毎一個人應該深切自問而驚醒的。我們一再提出「實踐戰時生活一，可是，大家熟視無睹，毫不介意，在戰時而熱中平時享用生活，怎樣能與敵人爭一日之短長呢？他又說：「但在朝在野人士，別說鞠躬盡翠而擔負十個人的工作，縱令　負一百人的工作而不辭勞苦的人，也到處可以碰到。」我們怎樣呢？朝野人士中，有幾個能夠一個人肯做十人百人的工作。這與他們「到處可以碰到」的相較，則文何如？</p>
<p>其次，他說：「假如此處發生了火災，在這樣情形上，第一個目標就是撲滅火燄，就是防止火勢的擴大，就是盡量使火災縮小到最低限度。無論男女老少，第一個最大任務必須是挈水桶和手桶，就近不斷澆水，以撲滅火災。在這個時候，全家大小總動員不必說，就是左右鄰舍也必須全體總動員，甚至附近的人也應如此。今日這種情形決不止於此，決不是像一家發生火災那樣不大危急的事。而是國家民族生死存亡之秋。在這樣情形下，不待他人的強制，不待政府當局的命令，不待上司的指揮，所有的人都應當自發地，拚命地努力，這是義不容辭的事。」我們對於這段話發生很大的感觸。自從敵美發動所謂太平洋反攻以後，美艦隊司令尼米資更倡言將以中國大陸為據點，反攻日本。同時，美艦隊亟思接近中國大陸，以實現其計劃。一方面，盟邦日本為確保大東亞戰爭的勝科，對此敵美野心，常然予以迎擊。在這樣情勢之下，我們中國大陸，很可能化為戰塲。於此，我們必須併力以赴，協同擊潰我們的敵人。第一，亳無疑問的，美國是我們東亞人的共同敵人，美軍在重慶方面已經逐漸膨脹勢力，企圖佔據中國大陸作為攻擊日本的基地，他們的目的，是在戰敗日本後恢復侵略東亞的舊勢力。如果日本被戰敗了，那木，中國當然受其侵略勢力的支配，而淪於奴役。如果說日本戰敗了，敵美就食給予中國以自由，這是十足欺騙的妄語，也祇有重慶方面少數人相信吧！第二，大東亞戰爭的目的，在大東亞會議的宣言中巳經明確說明，是束亞人為生存，自由，幸福而不辭一戰的。而敵人的戰爭目的，完全在於回復侵略，機績奴役東亞人民。我們在束亞人的立塲，對此戰爭目的，孰棄孰從，不待煩言已可明辨。第三，自從中日兩國捐棄前嫌，共問覺悟兄弟閱牆之錯，日本即實踐對華新政策，以事實消解過去兩國間的隔　。經過這一轉捩，為確保全東亞人的自由幸福，必須對以侵略奴役東亞人為目的的共同敵人，無論在東亞的任何角落作殊死戰，非至擊滅不可。</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下，敵美利用重慶伸張勢力，口頭上倡言以進攻日木為對象，而實際上仍以奴役東亞為目標的戰爭，我們應以理智判斷認職淸楚，如果中國大陸淪為戰塲，使中國地方人民遭受捐售者，是敵人英美。然後我們協同盟邦全力應戰，使担害減至最小限度，而澈底解險再被英美奴役的隱憂與危機。猶如德富先生所比喻的火災，道是英美為遂共野心而故縱的火災，我們將不論男女老幼，挈水桶手桶，不斷汲水，總動員撲滅道火災，實是義不容辭的事了。</p>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　緬甸前綫日軍某基地訊：印度國民軍刻在日軍之強力支援下，由哈卡方面開始行動，並為衝擊西非軍八十一師乏背後，乃由加拉頓河上遊方面開始進擊，一面擊潰所在之敵，一面向緬旬邊境繼續挺進。</p>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　緬甸前錢日軍某基地電，印緬邊境日軍對在零丘陵地一帶蠶動之英軍已發動攻勢，緬甸邊境之决戰，於南由阿拉坎北迄富貢地帶，長約千餘公里之綿長戰綫上，漸入於深刻化之階段，敵人狂呼之反攻缅甸，今已化為夢景。反觀敵南部印度之防禦，具有相當危機，敵軍為挽回危機，仍派其精銳之第七，第五兩師，出擊孟多及布其頓方面，圖奪回日溪，推進其反攻緬甸之基地，然由於日軍神速進擊，敵第七師巳吿崩潰，其第五師亦遭日軍挺身隊之攻擊而陷於混亂，是故敵方攻勢企煙已被摧毀。又西非軍被日軍誘至喀克特及阿波克瓦之中間地帶，遭日軍猛擊，陷於混亂狀態，現正欲向巴雷特瓦方面遁走，然日軍已佔領喀克特西北高地，與另一部日軍呼慼，逐漸壓縮其半圓形之包圍網。又琴丘陸地帶之日軍，自展開全動作戰後，巳粉碎由頓札恩開始活動之敵，故側面之威脅已被除去，又哈加方面日軍，已開抵加拉斯河之上流地區，同時並與印度國民軍互相呼應，繼續向吉大港猛進，南部印緬邊境印國民軍，亦與日軍各精銳部隊開抵邊境地帶，敵軍對加拉斯地方之日軍正作必死之抵抗。敵軍第二十六師，已急調住布其頓方面，岡阻止日軍之攻擊，然因遭日軍之挺身隊攻擊，陣容大混亂，按該方面敵軍兵力，於開戰時有第五，第七，第八十一，第二十六四師之衆，全部出動於日溪之正面，但均為日軍慴伏，即其後方之預備兵，亦相當脆弱，是故敵軍危機甚重。因此，印度國民軍之精銳，現正整備突破敵軍此脆弱，綫之態勢，後方日軍亦從容準備次期作戰中。又云，南方面渝軍現正構築陣地，整務防務，防禦日軍之攻擊，然日軍　精銳，以上各情，可知印度國境之防衛及其國內政治危機，已日形不安矣。</p>

<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>盟邦日本新聞界元老德富蘇峯氏，　為日本每日新開社社賓，屢為該報撰文，洛陽紙貴，望重一時，本報已屢有　譯轉載。最近穗富氏又撰一閑話時局」一文，頗其價値。爰即迻譯分日轉載。並介紹略歷於次：</p>
<p>按德富蘇峰氏，熊本縣人，文久三年（一八六四年）一月生，學於同志社，著「將來之日本」一書，馳譽文壇。繼發起民友社，任社長，並發刊國民新聞。明治二十九年，漫遊歐洲，三十年被任為內務省勅任參事官，叙正五位。四十四年，勅選為貴族院議員。大正六年，遊歷中國。七年以後，從事「近世日本國民史」鉅著，十二年，由帝國學士院授賞。十四年，被選為帝國學士院議員。昭和三年，舉行大典時，陸勳二等。四年，辭國民　聞社長為大阪每日新開，東京日日新聞社社賓，地位隆崇。十二年六月，被選焉帝國藝術院會員，著書凡數百十卷，皆傳誦一時。現為大東亞建設審議會委員，日本文　報國會，日本言論報國會會長。——編者附註</p>
<p>德國新造海空兩用大飛船在前綫已顯其特長</p>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電　據德航空部主辦之雜誌透露：穗國最大之飛船BA二二二號，配置馬達六具，船身兩層，長卅七公尺，高五，六公尺，翼長四十六公尺，後舵甚高，浮時離水十公尺，下層可容全副武裝之軍士一百名，上層則有寬敞之駕駛室及駕駛員室，該飛船上配置鋼砲多門及機關槍多挺，此海空兩用飛船巳在前綫大顯其特長。</p>
<p>現在還談非常時期這類話，也是不智慧的事。非常時期早已出現於眼前了，敵人業巳傾其全力，想一氣呵成，突破堪稱日本海上的所謂馬其諾綫。本來這是殲滅敵人的時期，在决心動作之前，用不着恐懼，用不着吃驚，用不着慌張，我們要靠我們的力量。</p>
<p>這就是說，口頭上只是講非當時期，而行為却依然故我，幾與承平時代無異。當然我們並不一概而論，例如束絛自相那種雷厲風行的活動，就是一例。此外不亞於首相的官吏，我認為也决非少數。此外在野人士也一樣。別說鞠躬盡瘁而擔負十個人的工作，縱令擔負一百人的工作而不辭勞苦的人，也到處可以碰到。然而最可惜者，一般大多數人的態度，是舊態依然的。固然到處都可以看到許多部門的裁併，名稱的變更，機構的修正等，但這歸根結底，不過是表面工作，而其內容則依然如故，眞是換湯不換藥的不澈底現象。既如是，今天我們不憚重煩，一再痛言直陳，為適應目前國家危急存亡之秋，必須一萬萬國民，　一心一德，表示非常時期的偉大决心，犧牲非常時期的偉大代價，進行非常時期的偉大勞作者，實出於不得已。</p>
<p>假如此處發生了火災。在這種　形上，第一個目的就是撲滅火焰，就是防止火勢的擴大，就是盡量使火災縮小到最低限度。無論男女老小，第一個最大任務必須是望永桶和手桶，就近不斷澆水，以撲滅火災。在這個時侯，全家大小總動員不必說。獻是左右隣舍也必須全體總動員，甚至附近的人也應如此。今日這種情形，決不止於此。決不是像一家發生火災那樣不大危急的事。而是國家民族生死存亡之秋，在這種情形下，不待他人的強制，不待政府當局的命令，不待上司的指揮，所有的人都應當自發地，拼命地努力，這是義不容辭的事。然而今日隨使一增，到處都有逍遙自在，不關心時局嚴重的人，眞是令人髮指，痛心疾目。</p>
<p>繁文縟禮，並非日本的專有水土病，而是全世界的通有病，但這種病在非常時期的今天，仍舊屹然存在。按我們所聽到的，就是當局者本身，也苦惱於麻煩的機構裏，眞是所謂作　自縛的情形。所以要　的官吏，總是絞腦榨法地思索，對於這種鐵　網的障碍物，怎樣可以巧妙地跳過，怎樣可以斬釘斷鐵地順利通過，怎樣可以巧妙地逃避，這一類的臨機應變工作。更露骨一點說，怎樣可以以巧妙地避免許　關口手績的麻煩，這就是當前的第一要務。假如當局者本身是繁文縟禮的。那末對於人民的麻煩就不可言狀了。</p>
<p>總之，認識非當時局者，不一定都是公務員。民問也有這樣人。所謂利益，所謂幸福，在國家危急之際，都棄如敝屣，而只顧報效國家，再就敎育方面來看，正如此次八十四屆議會議事日程上所討論渚，在中學英文之類的敎科書裏，仍在敎着敵國的思想：如「上帝呵，請賜給英國皇帝勝利吧！」然而最令人奇怪者，即這是文部省所審定的敎枓書。此不謂之舊態，孰謂之舊態呢？道種實例，實在不遑枚舉。總之，國家的一部份，業巳覺悟時局的嚴重，然而其他部份，還是舊態依然。在理想上，雖然說現在已經是一萬萬國民總力戰，而在事實上，凡其正義感之人士，絕對不能說是道樣的，</p>
<p>總之，匪治中葉以來，所謂法治國這句話，業已成為日本國家的最高原則，為達到這一目的，並非人支配法，而是法支配人。所以無論法律怎樣完備，如果人的思想顯腦不改變，始終是不會改變舊態的。本來，人是按常　行動的。而常識，因此便比人本身担負責任更大。即把一切都推諉到法上，以法為盾，以法為矛，而人只是看着法工作的法之守望者，這樣仍然還談不到上軌道。無論怎樣使法簡易起來，而人類本身如不簡易的話，縱會有翻天覆　的改革，也不過是單純注的改革。無論法度怎樣麻煩，而人類本身育負實任，人類本身肯按、常識執行事務，則一切的法全都會活躍起來。這就是說，有人始有法，並不是說，有法始有人。我們並不是說，現在是非常時期，不管任何法度，我行我素，任意胡為。我們只是說，要活用法度。然而這種活用，是在人為·所以我們眞想認識非常時期，如果不首先在政府方面，在一般人民方面，全都建立起來一個人才本位，常識本位，實任本位的新世界，我認為絕對不能拯救國家於危急。這就是筆者今日大聲急呼尊重人才的理由。（未完）（魯譯自二月十一日每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c22">緬甸各戰綫敵軍戰敗情形　日陸軍報道部發言人談 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊　日駐華上海陸軍部報道部之定例戰道常會，昨（十五）日下午三時假外灘華懋飯店八樓舉行，陸軍部報道部方而計到坂本中尉，赤星矚托等，即席由報道部發言人就緬甸戰塲狀態，及敵方敗戰情形，關述綦詳。分誌如次：</p>
<p>巧妙作戰通擊敵軍</p>
<p>發言人首對緬甸戰塲敵軍之配合，與日軍之巧妙作戰，加以詳細說明，謂：敵方在緬之配合，有英印軍，英事，西非軍，美步兵，以及在史蒂威爾所統治之渝軍等，分散在緬各戰塲。與日軍作戰，一切淸形及日軍之戰果，先後報道發表頗詳，均經日軍以巧妙之作戰，分別予以痛擊。我人綜觀今日緬甸之戰局，當有下列各種意義，　緬甸國防已逐漸鞏固，緬國民抱定必勝信念。　給與敵方一切損害非常實大，其中以英印軍之損書尤為慘重，已無法重振。　緬甸戰况給予印度國民影響極鉅，由此結果，印國民對英失去信仰，引起強烈之反英心理，且因自由印度國民軍與日軍駢肩作戰之關係，對整個印度影響甚大，而印羣衆反英之情緒，亦益形激昻，故敵方欲奪回緬甸之企圖，事實上完全為不可能。同時渝方企求之援助，亦發生困難，故緬戰綫敵軍之失敗，同時影響渝地民衆心理至鉅，並對英發生懷疑。綜上以觀，反軸心軍隊在物質上精神上受打擊之深，敵方曾誇構，以建設里多公路為目標，並謂利用作戰時間建設之，但經此次之打擊，已全歸泡影矣。</p>
<p>里多公路建設難成</p>
<p>旋發言人將里多公路情勢，加以解釋，略謂：渝接濟路綫，當初依賴滇緬公路，歷經日軍在緬甸作戰破壞殆盡，渝方難加利用，故謀從印繞道至渝，以建設此里多公路，該路通印加爾各答，由該處鐵道，貫通至里乃、經富貢、溪谷，及塔洛，孟關，密支那　至滇編公路一段，再達重慶，其建設情形，里乃至塔洛一段，建設雖大部完成，而塔洛至印渝邊境，尙有二百六十公里，迄今尙未建設完成。詎敵方夢想將里多公路建設完成後，以圖作對日反攻之舉，但該路非但未予完成，而中途又被日軍摧毁頗多，故今後之建設困難重重，絕難達到目的，是以經日軍之出奇制勝，首先將孟關　以南完全確保，隨時加以出擊，故敵方之單戀斷難成為事實。按最近緬甸戰塲，日軍在絕對勝利中，將阿拉坎吿一叚落，此外在加拉頓及富貢溪谷，與緬甸中部伊洛瓦底江之支流金穗威河（即欽邱陵）加以澈底之殲滅。</p>
<p>緬甸戰敗影響渝方</p>
<p>發言人又指摘三月九日渝大公報所載之無聊詭稱：渝遠征軍對八莫與密支那之二大目標，乃在緬甸重開補給路綫云云，而我人綜觀敵方最近狀况，日軍之運用巧妙作戰策略，在孟關附近將敵軍加以層層包圍，且將敵建設之里多公路，予以完全切斷。是以觀此作戰事實，我人再將敵方之宜傳，加以分析，充分證明敵軍已在失敗中告終結矣。彼輩不僅在軍事上失敗，而渝方已感動搖，論經濟方面所受緬作戰之失敗影響極大，在昆明桂林物價暴漲頗厲，是以日軍在緬甸之獲得大勝，不但在軍事上意義重大，即在政治社會經濟上言之，均有重大意義，此外敵美方面，對此亦遣憾非常，蓋美步兵在東亞大陸戰塲上之出現，猶屬初次，且彼輩在西南太平洋上具有作戰經騐，此次在東亞大陸戰塲上，經日軍巧妙作戰制勝，使美軍一蹶不振，出師不利，迴想過去美方大事宣傳，欲將中國大陸淪為對日作戰根據地，準備發動對日攻勢，首次已吿失敗，故其今後實行之計劃，乃再事準備，益將困難重重。</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3 id="c23">秩序與紀律 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>自由經濟，因為太無秩序了，所以終於崩潰而不能立足；統制經濟是要限制人民的自由的，所以一切都要由國家來集中管理，因此，　制經濟也可說是管理經濟。假定統制形成腐化狀態時，誰也不去管它，統制不能滿足人民欲望時，誰也不去理它，那末，管理二字，適得其反，而管理經濟的病態，便要與自由經濟同病相憐了，那就是沒有秩序與紀律。</p>
<p>沒有秩序與紀律是統制經濟的第一缺陷，因為少數人私用職權，營私舞弊，不惜使大多數人的生活，陷於日暮途窮之境；同時，米的黑市，布的黑市，以至一切日常用品的黑市，猖獗凌亂得不可收拾，似從無一人過問；基於這樣一個無紀律，無秩序的狀態，暴利思想遂乃日益猖獗，如火如荼，風氣所趨，上行下效，而國家的紀律與秩序，遂益不堪問了。因此，我們日月呼號革新政治為革新經濟之先。</p>
<p>日本的統制經濟所以能够行之有效，就是因為能够運用高度的政治力量，斷然實行「整理統合一政策，同時，對於一切經濟犯罪者，執法如山絲毫不假寬貨，所以才能建樹其統制經濟的秩序與紀律。</p>
<p>前日國民外交促進會歡迎中村公使茶會席上，有幾位列席者所說的話是十分耐人尋味的。一位說：「米的黑市不必去說了，布則惟有從警察手中可以買到！」又有一位說：「什麼米糧增產？米糧常局的私囊不是增產了嗎？」又有一們說：「前傳米統會以辦公地址不敷，想搬到跑馬廳去，聞者憂之，因為米統會的辦公人員愈多，我們所得到的配給米就要愈少了！」因此，這裏寫了一段　秩序與紀律。」</p>

<h3 id="c30">上海金融現狀裏面觀 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 苦口</p>
<p>上海整個經濟市塲中，以金融界的畸形發展，最為熱鬧；近一二年來，新開辦的銀行，有如雨後春筍，環顧南京路江西路九江路寗波路北京路等一家一家新設的銀行，個個都是莊嚴的門面，好像祗有辦銀行是最時髦的事業，祗有辦銀行才有生路似的；一時的風氣所播，銀行某就成為上海金融界的驕子。假使稍加硏究，便知他們開辦銀行的理由，無非是吸收存款，再利用人家存款購買物資股票地產，以待物價地產股票上漲；而獲厚利。這可說是一般所開銀行的主要目的，也就是從事新開銀行業的心理。由於此種不正當的心理而造成的後果如何，我們不妨再進一步指點出來。到底是好呢？是壞呢？大家得要一個相當的認識和敎訓</p>
<p>據一般銀行營業的實况來看，所有吸收的存款都是活期，存戶因為物價日益高漲，便又顧慮其存款貨幣之不足恃，遂覺與其存貨幣，又不如存物資之為穩妥，於是提取存款購置貨物了；因為彼此搶購物資，取有限的物資，供無限的收藏，物價當然往上升漲，這並不是完全基於供求律的上漲，而是由於羣購存藏不當心理的上漲。既然親友相傳，互相仿辦，則購藏物資之風焉有不熾之理？銀行之存款焉有不被提取之理？物價焉有不漲無止境之理？金融市塲之銀根焉有不緊之鉀？人人不信用貨幣，貨幣復何有信用可言？此種心理所造成的今日物價狂漲民不聊生的後果，實非偶然。一般號稱新貴的銀行家，對此作何感想？</p>
<p>近來上海金融市塲發生銀根奇緊的現象，也是銀行家自作自受的。我們的解釋是：因為銀行自己造成「重物輕弊」的空氣，於是存戶為購藏貨物而向銀行提取存款，但銀行所收之存款，正如上述，已經購存了物資，股票，與地產；一旦為存戶提存，一時又不肯售去其所存的物資，勢即不得不四處張羅，出重利以圖搜　資金，應付存戶；資金愈經搜集，銀根即態見其緊，此為事實所必然的。再從其內幕之內幕以觀，一般新開設的銀行，大都是股束而兼重要職員；彼等以投人股款為其人門途徑，因為取得銀行中重要職務，則個人即可利用地位，向銀行作貸借抵押，以達其購藏物資之慾望；一日銀根見緊，銀有支持困難，照例即應收回貸款押款，可是，主持人在表面上雖則焦急異常，催促欠款，而辦理其事者，即是其中重要職員，也就是貸用銀行資金者：如此情形，不帝是以左手向右手討欠，試問其收回貸款，又何能有效？銀行是大家所有的，囤貨是為着個人的；陶醉於私利私慾的人，又誰肯犧牲個人利益，而為大家設想呢？事實上能够犧牲小我，而為銀行謀正當發展的，恐怕沒有一個人吧！銀行既處於這種情况之下，其造成的結果父將為如何，明眼人當可知過半了。那末，最後趨勢是怎樣呢？必是銀行無力支持，不得不將所藏物資出售；到了此時，物價必趨跌落，所以近來股市不振，亦即此因。銀行既然不得已出售物資，因之物價趨於下跌，自然是一般巿民，受其實惠，一般購藏者與盲目隨從者，受其損害，其始作俑者原不足惜，祗是盲從者未免可憐了。筆者並非危言聳聽，不過心所謂危，未安緘默。凡視新開銀行為發財大道者，敢勸其從速回頭，因為救人即是救己，否則前途禍害無窮，必至萬刦不復，不僅大好的上海市塲，橫遭此輩毁滅，即是整個人民生活的前途，亦將蒙其影響，銀行乎，銀行乎，不知多少禍患假汝等之名而召致的，此後廳當知所警悟罷！</p>

        <h1>1944.03.16</h1>
<h3 id="e1">Editorial: Reading Mr. Tokutomi Sohō's "Idle Talk on the Current Situation" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi Sohō is a veteran in the Allied Japanese press, highly respected for his moral character and literary accomplishments. Recently, he published an article titled "Idle Talk on the Current Situation" in the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, which is of great value. This newspaper has specially translated it and is publishing it in installments (see today's second edition). Mr. Tokutomi's words are candid and straightforward encouragement to the Japanese government and people. We are not flattering Japan, nor are we belittling ourselves. Whether it is in terms of political, economic, and cultural measures, or social phenomena, people's livelihood, and so on, comparing Japan and China, there is no doubt that China lags far behind. However, after reading Mr. Tokutomi's article, we see that he still sharply criticizes Japan's current situation. Looking back at our own situation, our criticisms and the resulting reactions only make us feel more ashamed.</p>
<p>Han Yu said: "The gentlemen of ancient times were strict and comprehensive in their demands on themselves, and lenient and concise in their treatment of others. Strict and comprehensive demands lead to diligence; lenient and concise treatment encourages people to do good." Because "self-discipline" can be "strict and comprehensive," one can be "diligent" in everything concerning oneself. This means "strict self-discipline." Mr. Tokutomi prepared his own country with "strict and comprehensive" demands, hoping to arouse the "diligent" spirit of his people. At the same time, when the government and people heard his advice, they would certainly not find it annoying. Such a candid attitude of "not concealing" and "not embellishing" only makes us feel more ashamed.</p>
<p>We believe that Mr. Tokutomi's words are actually something that we Chinese should accept. Here, we specially quote them as follows:</p>
<p>He said, "People only talk about extraordinary times, extraordinary times, but their behavior remains the same as in peacetime." This is something that each of us should deeply ask ourselves and awaken to. We have repeatedly proposed "practicing wartime living," but everyone turns a blind eye and does not care. How can we compete with the enemy if we are enthusiastic about enjoying peacetime life during wartime? He also said, "But there are people in and out of the government who, not to mention bowing and scraping to bear the work of ten people, can even be found everywhere who bear the work of a hundred people without complaint." What about us? How many people in and out of the government are willing to do the work of ten or a hundred people? Comparing this with their "found everywhere," what can we say?</p>
<p>Secondly, he said, "If a fire breaks out here, the first goal in such a situation is to put out the flames, to prevent the spread of the fire, and to minimize the damage as much as possible. Regardless of men, women, old, or young, the first and greatest task must be to carry water buckets and hand buckets, constantly pouring water nearby to extinguish the fire. At this time, it goes without saying that the whole family should be mobilized, and even the neighbors on the left and right must be fully mobilized, and even people nearby should do so. Today's situation is far more than this, and it is not as trivial as a fire in one family. Rather, it is the autumn of national survival. In such a situation, without waiting for the coercion of others, without waiting for the orders of the government authorities, without waiting for the command of superiors, everyone should spontaneously and desperately strive, which is an unavoidable duty." We have a great feeling about this passage. Since the enemy America launched the so-called Pacific counter-offensive, Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US fleet, has even advocated using the Chinese mainland as a base to counterattack Japan. At the same time, the US fleet is eager to approach the Chinese mainland to realize its plan. On the one hand, Allied Japan, in order to ensure the victory of the Greater East Asia War, naturally counterattacks this ambition of the enemy America. Under such circumstances, our Chinese mainland is very likely to become a battlefield. Here, we must work together to defeat our enemies. First, without a doubt, the United States is the common enemy of us East Asians. The US military has gradually expanded its power in the Chongqing area, attempting to occupy the Chinese mainland as a base for attacking Japan. Their purpose is to restore their old forces of aggression in East Asia after defeating Japan. If Japan is defeated, then China will naturally be dominated by its aggressive forces and fall into slavery. If we say that after Japan is defeated, the enemy America will give China freedom, this is a completely deceptive and delusional statement, and only a few people in Chongqing believe it! Second, the purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been clearly stated in the declaration of the Greater East Asia Conference, which is that East Asians are fighting for survival, freedom, and happiness. The enemy's war aims are entirely to restore aggression and continue to enslave the people of East Asia. From the standpoint of us East Asians, we can clearly distinguish which war aims to abandon and which to follow, without the need for tedious words. Third, since China and Japan abandoned their past grievances and commonly realized the mistakes of brothers quarreling within the walls, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, using facts to resolve the past estrangement between the two countries. After this turning point, in order to ensure the freedom and happiness of all East Asians, we must fight to the death against the common enemy whose purpose is to invade and enslave East Asians, no matter in any corner of East Asia, until they are destroyed.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances, enemy America uses Chongqing to expand its power, verbally advocating that its target is to attack Japan, but in reality, it still aims to enslave East Asia. We should use our reason to judge and clearly recognize that if the Chinese mainland becomes a battlefield, and the local people of China suffer from devastation, it is the enemies, Britain and America. Then we will cooperate with our allies and fight with all our strength to minimize the damage and thoroughly resolve the hidden worries and crises of being enslaved by Britain and America again. Just like the fire that Mr. Tokutomi compared, it is a fire deliberately set by Britain and America to fulfill their ambitions. We will, regardless of men, women, old, or young, carry water buckets and hand buckets, constantly drawing water, and mobilize all our efforts to put out the fire. This is indeed an unavoidable duty.</p>
<h3 id="e2">After the Trial of Embezzlement Case Concluded, the Major Criminals Hu Dachun and Zheng Were Executed by Shooting at Yuhuatai in Beijing Yesterday Morning <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Special Telegram) - Hu Dachun, former Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province and former Director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, and Zheng, Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, were involved in a case of major fraud in the procurement of military grain during the war. After being dismissed by the National Government and handed over to a special court for trial, the trial has now concluded. Both criminals confessed their guilt and have been sentenced to death. The instructions have been submitted to the National Government for approval and were executed on the 15th. At 10:30 a.m. on the same day, Qian Sen, a judge of the special court, arrived at the court and ordered Chen Peizhi, the chief of the judicial police, to bring the two criminals, Hu and Zheng, to the court, together with Yu Sen, the commander of the 3rd Regiment of the Military Police.

<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The case of Hu Dachun, former Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and Zheng, former Director of the Aquatic Products Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Food, for crimes such as embezzlement, has been handed over to a special court for trial by order of the National Government, and the trial has now concluded, sentencing them to death. The original text of the special court's verdict is now Qian Hou:</p>

Residing at No. 29, Lane 280, Futong Road, Shanghai, former Director of the Rice Grain Procurement and Sales Office of the Jiangsu-Song-Chang-Jia District of the Ministry of Food.</p>
<p>The judgment of this court on the case of the above defendants for crimes such as embezzlement is as follows:</p>
<p>Main text Hu Dachun jointly speculated and manipulated military supplies and daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, which was sufficient to hinder supply and demand relations, sentenced to death, and deprived of civil rights for life. Zheng jointly and continuously intended to make profits during wartime, speculated and manipulated daily necessities, hoarding and speculating, which was sufficient to hinder supply and demand relations, sentenced to death, and deprived of civil rights for life, one Western-style suit, four ties, and one pair of cotton shoes were confiscated.</p>
<p>Bribes and illicit profits of National Currency 7,419,458.538 yuan were recovered and confiscated from Hu Dachun, and National Currency 5,600,000 yuan was recovered and confiscated from Zheng.</p>
<p>Facts Hu Dachun was the Director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province. In April of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he ordered 1,000 shi of brown rice from Shi Kaizeng, a rice merchant in Qingpu County, at 280 yuan per shi, and prepaid a check for 280,000 yuan. When the price of rice gradually reached 900 yuan per shi, Hu Dachun plotted to profit from it and instructed Shi Kaizeng to hand over the rice money instead of delivering the rice. Shi Kaizeng then issued a check for 300,000 yuan and subsequently delivered 130,000 yuan in cash to Hua Chuangqiu, a prostitute in Suzhou, in early October. Hu Dachun then withdrew 10,000 yuan from the cash and bought a Western-style suit and four ties in Shanghai. He bought a pair of cotton shoes in Suzhou. Later, because one of the checks could not be cashed, he only actually obtained a bribe of 430,000 yuan. On March 27th of the same year, Hu Dachun ordered Tang Keming, the magistrate of Songjiang County, to purchase 30,000 shi of rice. The magistrate actually received 32,000 shi. Geng Jiaji informed him to falsely report a smaller amount, so Tang Keming only reported 22,163 shi to the Joint Venture. After Hu Dachun approved it, Geng Jiaji and Tang Keming colluded to sell the remaining 9,836 shi for profit and gave Hu Dachun a bribe of 800,000 yuan. (150,000 yuan, Hu Dachun alone obtained a bribe of 200,000 yuan. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Philippine Compilation of New Budget</p>
<p>Manila, 15th (Central News Agency) - After the reform of the administrative structure, the Philippine government is actively compiling the budget for the 1944 fiscal year. According to the Philippine Information Bureau, the budget for the current department for that year has been decided to be a total of 58,238,884 pesos, which is a reduction of 8,176,586 pesos compared to the 59,115,470 pesos of departmental expenses decided by the Philippine Congress before the reform of the administrative structure. The reason why such a huge budget can still be reduced despite the establishment of the new Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, and other bureaus is the reduction of expenditures centered on personnel expenses by eliminating redundant personnel in various departments or dispersing them to local areas. This result is sufficient to represent the Philippine government's determination to fight.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Army Implements New Operation on the Central Indo-Burmese Border, Launching a General Attack on Don Zaun from Three Sides <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - A telegram from the Burmese front on the 15th states that the Japanese army's preemptive operation on the central Indo-Burmese border is proceeding extremely smoothly. The elite Japanese troops have formed an encirclement around the British Indian 17th Division entrenched in the area south of Don Zaun. The annihilation of the enemy troops in that area is only a matter of time. This operation is of great significance, with two meanings: Annihilating the British Indian army in Don Zaun and the area south of it is equivalent to cutting off the enemy troops within the Burmese border, thereby ensuring the security of Burma and preventing the enemy from acting from that area. After the Japanese army destroys the enemy troops south of Don Zaun, it will not be threatened from the side when attacking the Bay of Bengal. At the same time, it will make the operation easier to carry out and establish close contact with the actions of the Japanese army in the Kaladan River Valley. Due to the above-mentioned influence, the Japanese army's new operation can echo the offensive against the enemy's rear from the Kaladan side. The British Indian 15th Army Corps in a certain key point in the Bay of Bengal is still continuing to plot a counter-offensive in the Bukitdon area, and its rear will inevitably feel a major threat due to this operation.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to cut off the retreat route of the main force of the enemy 17th Division near Tiddim, the Japanese army is currently advancing westward through the mountainous area east of Don Zaun, urgently pursuing the fleeing enemy troops. On the 12th, they reached the mountains surrounding Don Zaun, and on the morning of the 13th, they launched a general attack on Don Zaun from the east, southeast, and northeast, engaging in fierce battles with the enemy troops. The Japanese army advancing from the left is currently attacking from the southwest of Don Zaun. It is only a matter of time before Don Zaun falls. The enemy's 17th Division, numbering about 10,000, is now extremely disheveled.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - A message from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front: The Indian National Army, under the strong support of the Japanese army, has begun operations from the Haka area. In order to attack the rear of the 81st Division of the West African Army, they have begun an attack from the upper reaches of the Kaladan River, destroying the enemy in the area and continuing to advance towards the Burmese border.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Decisive Battle Stage on Burmese Border Gradually Intensifies, Battle Line Stretches Over a Thousand Kilometers <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - A message from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front: The Japanese army on the Indo-Burmese border has launched an offensive against the British army operating in the Lingqiu Ridge area. The decisive battle on the Burmese border is gradually entering a stage of intensification on a long battle line stretching approximately 1,000 kilometers from Arakan in the south to Fugong in the north. The enemy's wild cry for a counter-offensive in Burma has now turned into a dream. On the other hand, the enemy's defense in southern India is facing a considerable crisis. In order to reverse the crisis, the enemy army is still sending its elite 7th and 5th Divisions to attack the Mendo and Bukitdon areas, attempting to recapture Jilgye and advance its base for counter-attacking Burma. However, due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, the enemy 7th Division has collapsed, and its 5th Division has also been attacked by the Japanese suicide squad and fallen into chaos. Therefore, the enemy's offensive attempt has been destroyed. The West African Army was lured by the Japanese army to the intermediate zone of Kakhert and Apokwa, was severely attacked by the Japanese army, and fell into a state of chaos. It is now trying to escape towards Barretwa, but the Japanese army has occupied the northwest highlands of Kakhert and is gradually compressing its semi-circular encirclement net with another unit of the Japanese army. The Japanese army in the Chin Hills land area has crushed the enemy that began to operate from Don Zaun since the start of the full-scale operation, so the threat from the side has been removed. The Japanese army in the Haka area has reached the upper reaches of the Garas River, and at the same time, it is cooperating with the Indian National Army to continue to advance towards Chittagong. The Indian National Army in the southern Indo-Burmese border has also arrived at the border area with various elite units of the Japanese army. The enemy army is making a desperate resistance against the Japanese army in the Garas area. The enemy 26th Division has been urgently transferred to the Bukitdon area to stop the Japanese army's attack, but its formation has been greatly disrupted by the Japanese suicide squad attack. According to the enemy army's strength in that area, there were 5th, 7th, 81st, and 26th Divisions at the start of the war, all of which were dispatched to the front of Jilgye, but all were ambushed by the Japanese army. Even its reserve forces in the rear are quite weak. Therefore, the enemy army's crisis is very serious. Therefore, the elite of the Indian National Army is now preparing to break through the enemy's weak line, and the Japanese army in the rear is also calmly preparing for the next operation. It is also said that the Chongqing army in the southern area is now building fortifications, preparing defenses, and defending against the Japanese army's attack. However, the Japanese army is elite. From the above information, it can be known that the defense of the Indian border and its domestic political crisis have become increasingly uneasy.</p>

<p>Jakarta, 15th (Central News Agency) - Two years have passed since the conquest of Java. Thanks to the prevalence of the Japanese military administration and the implementation of various meticulous plans, the important mission of strengthening its military power has been gradually realized. The formation of the Volunteer Labor Corps and the expansion of the Police Defense Corps and the Youth Corps have further strengthened the defense posture of the entire region and ensured security. The militarization of supplies and the strengthening of transportation capacity, with concentrated production as the center, are also moving forward according to the predetermined goals. In particular, since the establishment of the Javanese Public Service Association, a central conference was held in Jakarta in less than a month. The guidelines decided by the conference are as follows: In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, exert all efforts to overcome all difficulties. Maintain the spirit of public service in order to thoroughly implement various military administration measures. Without distinction between regions, wholeheartedly and with one mind and one heart, build a new Java in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In this way, military officials and civilians, as well as Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians, are all united, and the Japanese military administration agencies are internally and externally integrated, promoting wartime measures. It is worth looking forward to in terms of Java's defense and increased production.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Hai News Agency: British Prime Minister Churchill's travel restrictions are the first step in isolating Southern Ireland from Britain and the outside world. The United States has asked Ireland to close the Axis embassies and consulates in Dublin, which he fully supports. The U.S. government is constantly reporting on this issue to the British government. The United States is taking the initiative, but the British government is constantly offering suggestions. The British government has long since taken various measures to reduce the danger caused by the presence of Axis representatives in Ireland. "But now is the time to improve these measures."</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: According to a New York correspondent's commentary from Zurich, the U.S. government is coercing Ireland. U.S. government observers claim that this move by the United States is only part of its actions towards the world. It is acting similarly towards Argentina and Spain. It is expected that in the near future, the United States will take action against other European countries that remain neutral.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 14th: Although the Soviet offensive on the central and northern front, stretching 1,200 kilometers from Gomel to Narva Bay, has stalled, fierce fighting continues on the southern front along a 600-kilometer line in front of the Bug River. The Soviets, with superior forces, attacked the main German positions in the area between Pogrebische and Novy Bng, southwest of Krivoy Rog, and the riverbanks between Vinnitsa and Nikolayev. However, the Germans have conducted an organized avoidance operation. German rearguard units, in order to stop the Soviets, have crushed their attempts to break through. After fierce defensive battles, the German forces in that area have improved their positions according to plan. In the northern part of the Bug front, the Soviets are currently attacking the German positions in the Starokonstantinov district, but due to the German reinforcement of defensive positions in the area, the Soviets have suffered heavy losses. German forces have driven Soviet troops out of the streets of Ternopol and are continuing fierce fighting east of the city. The Soviets have been trying to encircle the city since the 11th and are currently sending reinforcements. In the southern part of the Bug River, southeast of Krivoy Rog, the Soviets are attempting to advance towards the Inhul and Inhulec rivers. Elsewhere, the Soviets are intensifying pressure on German forces in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. However, the German forces, in order to improve their positions, have retreated to the city of Nikolayev.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – On the 14th, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement regarding the Soviet government's recognition of the Batista regime. Chairman Stalin, disregarding the United Kingdom and the United States, unilaterally recognized the Batista regime, while the United Kingdom often claims the Mediterranean as the lifeline of the British Empire. This time, due to the Soviet Union's recognition of the Italian puppet regime, the British government seems to be panicking. The Soviet Union also insisted on its own views when recognizing the Turgut regime, causing the United Kingdom and the United States to take the same measures. It is expected that after the Soviet Union recognizes the Italian puppet regime, its voice in southern Italy will be strengthened. King Emmanuel III sold out the Fascist Party in order to maintain his throne and is now attempting to follow Stalin to eke out a living. The Italian people are truly in danger of being communized.</p>

<p>Germany's Newly Built Sea-Air Amphibious Airship Shows Its Strengths on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a magazine run by the German Aviation Department, the largest airship in Germany, the BA-222, is equipped with six motors, a two-story hull, 37 meters long, 5.6 meters high, and a wingspan of 46 meters. The rear rudder is very high, and it floats 10 meters above the water. The lower floor can accommodate 100 fully armed soldiers, while the upper floor has a spacious cockpit and pilot's room. The airship is equipped with many steel cannons and machine guns. This sea-air amphibious airship has already shown its strengths on the front lines.</p>
<p>It is unwise to talk about this as an 'emergency situation' anymore. The emergency is already here, right before our eyes. The enemy has already thrown everything they have at trying to break through what could be called Japan's 'Maginot Line' at sea. Really, this is the time to destroy the enemy. Before we act decisively, we don't need to be afraid, we don't need to be surprised, we don't need to panic. We have to rely on our own strength.</p>
<p>That is to say, in words we talk about an emergency, but in action we remain the same as ever, as if it were peacetime. Of course, we're not talking about everyone. For example, the thoroughness of those tightening the reins is one example. There are also more than a few officials, I think, who are no less than the Prime Minister. And it's the same with those out of office. Never mind exerting yourself to take on the work of ten people; there are those who take on the work of a hundred people without any hardship, everywhere you go. But the most regrettable thing is that the attitude of most people in general remains the same. Of course, everywhere you look, you can see a lot of departments being merged, names being changed, agencies being revised and so on, but when you get right down to it, it's nothing but window-dressing, and the content remains the same: a truly superficial phenomenon of 'new bottle, old wine'. Because it's like this, today we're not afraid to repeat ourselves, to speak out bluntly and frankly, that to adapt to our nation's hour of need, of crisis between survival and extinction, we must have our hundred million people be of one mind and one heart, express a great determination for this emergency situation, sacrifice the great price of this emergency situation, and carry out the great labor of this emergency situation. This is something that we are truly compelled to do.</p>
<p>If a fire breaks out here, the first goal is to extinguish the flames, to prevent the fire from spreading, and to minimize the damage as much as possible. Regardless of gender, age, or size, the first and greatest task must be to get buckets, hand-buckets, and constantly pour water nearby to put out the fire. At times like these, it goes without saying that the whole family will mobilize, and even those around us will do the same, and even the neighbors nearby should do this as well. This situation today is more serious than that. It is not an insignificant thing like a fire breaking out at home. It is a question of the life and death of the nation and the people. Under these circumstances, without waiting for others to force us, without waiting for the government's orders, without waiting for the commands of our superiors, everyone should spontaneously, desperately exert themselves. This is an unavoidable duty. But today, however, there are still those who are carefree, unconcerned with the seriousness of the situation, which is truly infuriating and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Red tape is not unique to Japan's culture; it is a common ailment throughout the world. But this ailment still exists firmly in today's emergency. According to what we've heard, those in charge are themselves troubled by the cumbersome machinery, which is truly a situation of 'self-imposed restrictions'. Therefore, capable officials are always racking their brains, thinking about how they can skillfully jump over these iron barriers, how they can cut through them decisively and pass through smoothly, and how they can skillfully evade them. To put it more bluntly, how can they cleverly avoid the trouble of numerous checkpoints and procedures? This is the first priority at present. If the authorities themselves are fond of red tape, then the trouble for the people is indescribable.</p>
<p>In short, those who recognize this emergency situation are not necessarily all civil servants. There are also such people among the common people. Things like personal gain and happiness, in the face of national crisis, are discarded like worn-out shoes, and they only care about serving the country. Looking at it from the perspective of education, just as the Eighty-Fourth Diet has discussed, textbooks for middle school English and the like still teach the ideas of enemy nations, such as "God, please grant victory to the King of England!" But what is most strange is that these are textbooks that have been approved by the Ministry of Education. If this isn't the same old way, what is? Examples of this kind are too numerous to list. In short, one part of the nation has already awakened to the seriousness of the situation, while other parts remain the same as before. In theory, it is said that we are now a nation of one hundred million people fighting together, but in reality, all those with a sense of justice absolutely cannot say that is how it is.</p>
<p>In short, since the middle of the time of bandit rule, the so-called 'rule of law' has already become the highest principle of the Japanese nation. In order to achieve this goal, it is not people controlling the law, but the law controlling people. Therefore, no matter how perfect the law is, if people's thinking doesn't change, the old ways will never change. Originally, people act according to common sense, and thus common sense bears more responsibility than people themselves. To push everything onto the law, to use the law as a shield and the law as a spear, and for people to only be watchers of the law, watching the law work, then we still cannot speak of things being on the right track. No matter how simple the law is made, if humanity itself isn't simplified, even if there is an earth-shattering revolution, it will be nothing more than a revolution in name only. No matter how cumbersome the laws are, if humanity itself bears the responsibility, if humanity itself is willing to carry out affairs according to common sense, then all the laws will come alive. That is to say, there is law because there are people. It is not that there are people because there is law. We are not saying that now is an emergency situation, and that we should disregard all laws, do as we please, and act recklessly. We are simply saying that we should make active use of the law. However, this active use is done by people. Therefore, if we truly want to recognize the emergency situation, if we do not first establish a new world in the government, in the general population, that is based on talent, common sense, and responsibility, I believe that we will absolutely not be able to save the country from crisis. That is the reason why I am loudly and urgently calling for respect for talent today. (To be continued) (Translated from the February 11th Mainichi Shimbun by Lu)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Rice Control Association (SRCA), in response to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government's request to increase rice rations, hereby transcribes the original text of its reply: "In accordance with your government's official letter No. 14464 from Shanghai, briefly stating that the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association has requested an increase in rice rations for households, and requesting our review and reply. We have reviewed this matter and find that our association is comprehensively planning the collection and distribution of rice. In the future, within the possible range, we will strive to appropriately increase rice rations for households. Correspondingly, we are hereby replying, hoping that you will take note of this and inform the relevant parties."</p>
<p>Formulating Measures to Prevent Rice Smuggling</p>
<p>In addition, in order to eliminate smuggling, the SRCA has specially formulated "Measures for Managing the Transportation and Sale of Rice and for Handling Confiscations and Fines": 1. These measures are formulated in accordance with Articles 90 and 92 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. 2. The confiscated rice by local enforcement agencies should be quickly handed over to the SRCA at the local purchase price. Items other than rice should be quickly transferred to the Trade Control Association at the current market price. 3. The proceeds from the transfer of confiscated goods and fines will be fully handed over to the provincial government. However, in accordance with Article 11 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Transportation and Sales, the bonuses to be awarded to informants will be allocated from these funds. However, the method of allocating bonuses when confiscations and fines are carried out by enforcement agencies other than Chinese ones (consulates, police, Japanese military police) should be determined by the relevant enforcement agency in consultation with the provincial government. 4. When the provincial government obtains confiscated goods or fines, it should promptly report the facts and their handling methods to the National Government and notify the Military Liaison Department, the Trade Control Association, and the SRCA.</p>

<h3 id="e22">The Enemy's Defeat in Various Battles on the Burmese Front - Remarks from the Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The regular press conference of the Press Department of the Japanese Army stationed in Shanghai was held yesterday (the 15th) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. Lieutenant Sakamoto, Akahoshi, and others from the Press Department of the Army were present. The spokesman of the Press Department gave a very detailed account of the situation on the Burmese battlefield and the enemy's defeat. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Skillful Operations in Attacking the Enemy</p>
<p>The spokesman first gave a detailed explanation of the enemy's cooperation and the Japanese army's skillful operations on the Burmese battlefield. He said that the enemy's forces in Burma consisted of British Indian troops, British troops, West African troops, American infantry, and troops from Chongqing commanded by Stilwell, scattered in various battlefields in Burma. The details of their battles with the Japanese army and the results of the Japanese army have been reported in detail. The Japanese army has given them a painful blow through skillful operations. Looking at the war situation in Burma today, there are the following meanings: 1. Burma's national defense has gradually been consolidated, and the Burmese people are determined to win. 2. The damage to the enemy is very substantial, especially the British Indian troops, whose losses are particularly severe and cannot be revived. 3. The war situation in Burma has had a great impact on the Indian people. As a result, the Indian people have lost faith in the British, causing a strong anti-British sentiment. Moreover, due to the relationship between the Free Indian National Army and the Japanese army fighting side by side, the impact on the entire India is very large, and the anti-British sentiment of the Indian masses is becoming more and more激昂. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to recapture Burma is in fact completely impossible. At the same time, the support sought by Chongqing has also become difficult. Therefore, the failure of the enemy on the Burmese front has also had a great impact on the psychology of the people in Chongqing and has caused them to doubt the British. In summary, the anti-Axis forces have suffered deep blows in terms of material and spiritual resources. The enemy has boasted of building the Ledo Road as a goal and said that it would be built during the war. However, after this blow, it has all gone up in smoke.</p>
<p>The Construction of the Ledo Road Is Difficult to Achieve</p>
<p>The spokesman then explained the situation of the Ledo Road, saying that Chongqing's supply line initially relied on the Burma Road, which was destroyed by the Japanese army's operations in Burma, making it difficult for Chongqing to use. Therefore, they planned to build the Ledo Road to Chongqing via India. The road connects to Calcutta in India, and from there the railway runs to Ledo, then through Fort Hertz, Hukawng Valley, and Tarong, Mong-Ko, Myitkyina, and then to a section of the Yunnan-Burma Road before reaching Chongqing. As for the construction situation, the section from Ledo to Tarong has been mostly completed, but there are still 260 kilometers from Tarong to the India-Chongqing border that have not yet been completed. The enemy dreamed of completing the construction of the Ledo Road in order to launch a counter-offensive against Japan. However, not only has the road not been completed, but it has also been destroyed by the Japanese army in many places along the way. Therefore, future construction will be fraught with difficulties and will be very difficult to achieve. Therefore, through the Japanese army's surprising victories, it first completely secured the area south of Mong-Ko and launched attacks at any time, so the enemy's wishful thinking will definitely not become a reality. According to recent reports from the Burmese battlefield, the Japanese army, in absolute victory, has put an end to the Arakan. In addition, the Japanese army has thoroughly annihilated the enemy in the Kaladan and Fort Hertz valleys, as well as the Kin-Nga River (i.e. the Chin Hills), a tributary of the Irrawaddy River in central Burma.</p>
<p>The Defeat in Burma Affects Chongqing</p>
<p>The spokesman also criticized the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao for its ridiculous claim on March 9 that the Chongqing Expeditionary Force's two major goals of Bhamo and Myitkyina were to reopen the supply line in Burma. Looking at the recent situation of the enemy, the Japanese army has skillfully used operational strategies to encircle the enemy in the vicinity of Mong-Ko and completely cut off the Ledo Road that the enemy was building. Therefore, analyzing this combat fact and the enemy's propaganda, it is fully proven that the enemy has ended in failure. They have not only failed militarily, but Chongqing has been shaken, and the Burmese war has had a great impact on the economic aspect. Prices in Kunming and Guilin have soared sharply. Therefore, the Japanese army's great victory in Burma is not only of great significance militarily, but also politically, socially, and economically. In addition, the United States is also very regretful about this. The appearance of American infantry on the East Asian mainland battlefield is still for the first time, and they have combat experience in the Southwest Pacific. This time, on the East Asian mainland battlefield, the Japanese army has skillfully defeated them, causing the American army to suffer a setback. Recalling the past, the United States made a major publicity campaign, wanting to turn the Chinese mainland into a base for operations against Japan and prepare to launch an offensive against Japan. The first attempt has ended in failure. Therefore, the plan for its future implementation will be re-prepared, which will be even more difficult.</p>
<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3 id="e23">Order and Discipline <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>A free economy collapses and cannot be sustained due to its excessive disorder; a controlled economy seeks to restrict the freedom of the people, so everything must be centrally managed by the state. Therefore, a controlled economy can also be called a managed economy. If control leads to corruption, with no one to oversee it, and control fails to satisfy the people's desires, with no one to address it, then the word "managed" becomes a contradiction. The pathology of a managed economy will then share the same plight as a free economy: a lack of order and discipline.</p>
<p>The lack of order and discipline is the primary flaw of a controlled economy. Because a few individuals abuse their authority for personal gain and engage in corruption, they do not hesitate to plunge the lives of the majority into dire straits. Meanwhile, black markets for rice, black markets for cloth, and even black markets for all daily necessities run rampant and chaotically, seemingly without anyone caring. Based on such a state of indiscipline and disorder, the pursuit of exorbitant profits becomes increasingly rampant, like a raging fire. The trend leads to emulation from above and below, and the nation's discipline and order become even more untenable. Therefore, we constantly advocate for political reform to precede economic reform.</p>
<p>The reason why Japan's controlled economy can function effectively is because it can wield a high degree of political power to decisively implement a policy of "consolidation and integration." At the same time, it enforces the law like a mountain against all economic criminals, showing no leniency whatsoever. Only in this way can it establish order and discipline in its controlled economy.</p>
<p>The words spoken by several attendees at the tea party held by the National Diplomatic Promotion Association to welcome Minister Nakamura the other day were thought-provoking. One person said, "There's no need to talk about the rice black market; the only place to buy cloth is from the police!" Another said, "What rice production increase? Isn't it the private pockets of the Rice Control Association that have increased?" Yet another said, "It's rumored that the Rice Control Association wants to move to the racecourse because its office space is insufficient. Those who hear this are worried, because the more staff the Rice Control Association has, the less rationed rice we will receive!" Therefore, I wrote a section here on "Order and Discipline."</p>
<h3 id="e24">Rumors Circulating About Treating Meningitis are Pure Nonsense; A Reasonable Approach Should be Taken <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Since the discovery of meningitis in this city, the relevant authorities and hospitals in this city have been making every effort to prevent and treat it, and have repeatedly announced in newspapers the methods to be adopted, advising citizens. However, in recent days, various simple methods and rumors have been circulating in the city, and ignorant women believe them to be true. Yesterday, a reporter visited a senior official of the police局, who informed him that the police局 has investigated and found that they are purely unfounded rumors. For the sake of public peace, the police局 specifically advises citizens that whether for prevention or treatment of meningitis, they should go to a formal hospital or consult a formal doctor, and should not blindly believe rumors, lest accidents occur.</p>

<p>The Cotton Management Office and the Cotton Control Committee under the National Chamber of Commerce are to be merged and renamed the Cotton Industry Control Committee, which will be implemented once approved by the relevant parties. It is understood that the proposed Cotton Industry Control Committee will have two departments under it: one is the Cotton Department, and the other is the Cotton Products Department. The former will serve as a purchasing organization for raw materials for cotton textiles, while the latter will be an organization that purchases yarn and cloth and then implements the rationing of yarn and cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Transfer of Judicial Personnel Must Not Be Delayed <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the adjustment of its personnel is originally intended to promote affairs and is of great importance. It specifically orders its subordinate units that all personnel dispatched by the Ministry, whether newly appointed or transferred, should promptly conclude all unfinished matters and proceed to their new posts once ordered, so as to take care of both sides and prevent any delay. If there are requests for adjustment under false pretenses or delays on the pretext of excuses, which are incompatible with the wartime system, it is difficult to tolerate for the sake of the authority and credibility of the law. The officials in charge should also not submit requests for retention on their behalf, resulting in prioritizing private interests over public duties and creating a bad trend.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Concert for Airplane Donation to be Held on the 19th <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Aircraft Donation Committee, in order to promote the aircraft donation movement, has specially requested the teachers and students of the National Conservatory of Music, the highest music institution in the country, to hold a large-scale concert three times at the Grand Theater. The first concert will be held on the 19th of this month, with an exceptionally brilliant program. In addition to a large mixed choir of one hundred and thirty men and women, there will be solo performances on cello, violin, piano, pipa, etc., solo performances by male and female tenors, and valuable chamber music such as piano trios and quintets. In order to promote noble music, the association has specially reduced the price of ordinary tickets to two types: one hundred yuan and sixty yuan. Tickets are now on sale at the Grand Theater.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Mediation Resolves Rickshaw Rental Dispute <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the soaring prices of applied rickshaw materials, hardware parts, and even the lack of goods on the market, the public rickshaw merchants in this city have had to seek out the black market. As a result, the cost of repairing each vehicle has increased sharply, and the original rental fee is difficult to maintain. Each vehicle must spend more than one thousand yuan per month. Therefore, they requested the Bureau of Social Welfare to adjust the rental fee, while the rickshaw pullers' trade union argued that the lives of the rickshaw pullers were already extremely difficult. Recently, due to the soaring prices of goods, their burden has increased repeatedly, and the soaring military rental fees in the black market are endless. They also submitted a request to the Bureau to crack down on this. After the Bureau sent personnel to investigate, it was found that both parties' claims were true. Considering that the matter concerns the city's public transportation, this dispute should be resolved as soon as possible. Therefore, it convened labor and management parties to implement mediation. After five convocations and exhortations, an agreement was finally reached.</p>

<h3 id="e30">A Look Inside Shanghai's Financial Situation <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Bitter Mouth</p>
<p>In Shanghai's entire economic market, the abnormal development of the financial sector is the most lively. In the past year or two, newly opened banks have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Looking around Nanjing Road, Jiangxi Road, Jiujiang Road, Ningbo Road, Beijing Road, etc., the newly established banks, one by one, have solemn facades, as if running a bank is the most fashionable business and the only way to make a living. Influenced by the prevailing trend, banks have become the pride of Shanghai's financial sector. If we study it a little, we will know that the reason for their opening banks is nothing more than absorbing deposits and then using other people's deposits to purchase materials, stocks, and real estate in anticipation of rising prices of materials, real estate, and stocks; and to obtain huge profits. This can be said to be the main purpose of the banks that are generally opened, and it is also the psychology of those engaged in the newly opened banking industry. What are the consequences of this improper mentality? We may as well point out further. Is it good? Is it bad? Everyone must have a considerable understanding and lesson.</p>
<p>According to the actual situation of general bank operations, all absorbed deposits are current deposits. Because prices are rising day by day, depositors are worried that their deposit currency is not reliable enough, so they feel that it is safer to deposit materials than to deposit currency, so they withdraw deposits to purchase goods. Because they rush to buy materials, take the limited materials to supply unlimited collections, prices will naturally rise. This is not entirely based on the law of supply and demand, but on the rising of the psychology of group purchase and storage. Since relatives and friends spread the word and imitate each other, is there any reason why the trend of purchasing and storing materials is not strong? Is there any reason why bank deposits are not withdrawn? Is there any reason why prices do not rise without limit? Is there any reason why the money supply in the financial market is not tight? Everyone does not trust currency, so what credibility can currency have? The consequences of today's soaring prices and people's inability to make a living caused by this mentality are not accidental. What do the general self-proclaimed nouveau riche bankers think about this?</p>
<p>Recently, the phenomenon of extremely tight money supply in the Shanghai financial market is also self-inflicted by bankers. Our explanation is: because the banks themselves created an atmosphere of "valuing goods and devaluing currency," depositors withdrew deposits from the bank to purchase and store goods, but the deposits received by the bank, as mentioned above, have already purchased and stored materials, stocks, and real estate; once depositors withdraw, they are unwilling to sell the stored materials for a while, so they have to look around and pay high interest rates to collect funds to meet the needs of depositors; the more funds are collected, the tighter the money supply becomes, which is inevitable. Looking at the inside story from its inside story, most of the newly established banks are shareholders and also important employees; they take investing shares as their entry point, because if they obtain important positions in the bank, individuals can use their position to borrow and mortgage from the bank to achieve their desire to purchase and store materials; once the money supply is tight and the bank has difficulty supporting it, according to the usual practice, loans and mortgages should be recovered, but the person in charge is ostensibly anxious and urges the payment of debts, but the person handling the matter is one of the important employees, who is also the borrower of bank funds: in this situation, it is like the left hand asking the right hand for debt, so how can the recovery of loans be effective? The bank belongs to everyone, and hoarding is for personal gain; who is willing to sacrifice personal interests and think for everyone's sake when they are immersed in personal gain and desire? In fact, I am afraid that no one can sacrifice the small self and seek the legitimate development of the bank! Since the bank is in this situation, what will be the result of its creation? People with discerning eyes should know more than half of it. Then, what is the final trend? It must be that the bank is unable to support it and has to sell the stored materials; at this time, prices will inevitably tend to fall, so the recent stock market slump is also due to this. Since the bank has no choice but to sell materials, and prices tend to fall as a result, it is naturally a benefit to the general public, and a loss to the general purchasers and blind followers. The original instigator is not worthy of pity, but the blind followers are inevitably pitiful. The author is not alarmist, but the heart is so dangerous that it is not safe to remain silent. Those who regard the newly opened bank as a way to get rich, I dare to advise them to turn back as soon as possible, because saving people is saving themselves, otherwise the future is full of endless disasters, and it will never be recovered. Not only will the great Shanghai market be destroyed by this kind of people, but also the future of the entire people's life will be affected. Bank, bank, I don't know how many disasters are caused by taking your name, you should be alert from now on!</p>

<p>Silk Industry Plans Collective Purchase of Spring Cocoons: Silk Reeling and Weaving Factories Ship Goods Smoothly</p>
<p>The spring cocoons of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year are about to enter the market. It is learned from the silk industry that the relevant parties are now preparing to collectively purchase them. The specific plan and other matters have been generally prepared. In addition to mobilizing people in the silk industry in various places, the relevant parties will also provide assistance in the purchase matters. Because in the current period when yarn and cloth cannot be purchased, silk fabrics are the only clothing raw materials for the people. It is also learned from the silk weaving industry that due to the good results of the autumn cocoon purchase last year, all silk reeling factories can ship goods in large quantities, so the silk weaving factories can obtain raw materials continuously, and the shipment is very smooth. The stock of silk and satin in this city is also quite large, and the addition is less than before, so the silk and satin market is now trending downstream.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Various Hospitals Inject Meningitis Preventive Vaccines <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Shanxi Hospital wrote yesterday saying: "Recently, cases of meningitis have been repeatedly discovered in this city. Treatment is urgently needed, but prevention and eradication are even more urgent. The preventive effect of this disease seedling slurry is also evident. The Taishi area is vast and the population is large. All doctors and hospitals have the obligation to provide free injections to assist the authorities in their shortcomings in order to achieve universality. Our hospital will start injections from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day from today, and no fees will be charged to anyone." (Note: The World Red Swastika Hospital, Youzhu Hospital, Boai Hospital, Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, Shangxian Hospital, Shanghai Health Association, Hongren Hospital, Renai Association, Tongren Hospital, Foguang Hospital, and various district health offices all provide free vaccination. Two vaccinations are effective.)</p>
<p>The Process of Refining Meningitis Treatment Drugs</p>
<p>Use five catties of soap alkali (i.e., green alkali), place it in a ceramic pot (do not use copper or iron utensils), and burn it on charcoal fire for two hours (coal briquette fire and firewood fire are insufficient, and cannot be used). It will turn into a liquid. Do not move it. Burn it for another two hours. It has become a dry substance. Then, add a large fire of charcoal to refine it for about two or three hours until the substance is dry and refined. If the ceramic pot is broken, put it on charcoal fire to refine it. The front and back are about seven or eight hours in total. The soap alkali is dry and crystalline. Remove the ceramic pot and take out the dry substance. The substance has three layers. The upper layer is as crisp as soil, the middle layer is dry and hard with red and black, and the upper and middle layers are not usable. The crystals are in the bottom layer, which is red and about two or three points thick. Use a knife to shovel out the red broken end, grind it in a magnetic bowl (do not use an iron millstone), sift it, wrap it in paper, put it on the ground overnight to remove its fire, and put it in a magnetic bottle for later use. There is about one tael, which can treat forty or fifty people. Each person uses two points, blowing one point into each nostril each time, and it will heal after blowing twice in a row. I previously published the Nie family's effective formula, but the pharmaceutical method was not detailed. I went to Xírì day to find this formula for all walks of life to imitate and save people. The method of use is the same as the Nie family's formula. If you need detailed single-page instructions (with a special formula for black fever attached), please apply to the Sanle Agricultural Products Store on Nanjing Road in this city from the 19th of this month, one sheet per person, without taking a penny. Letters and envelopes will not be answered. Previous inquiries from all walks of life about the manufacturing method will no longer be answered separately.</p>

Suzhou Mudu Gu Xin Zheng Pharmacy Each bottle of 10 yuan can treat one person. The above are all bridges that have been personally bought and cured many people. (Bridge)</p>
<p>Red Swastika Hospital Resumes Diagnosis</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society is located at No. 1171 Yuyuan Road. It has been operating for many years. This spring, Dr. Ding Shouren was hired as the president to do his best to rectify the interior and expand the equipment. Diagnosis was resumed on March 15, and patients of all levels were admitted from the 20th, and doctors outside the hospital were welcome to refer patients and borrow equipment. In order to benefit the poor and sick, the hospital still provides diagnosis every day and has free hospital beds. Recently, due to the epidemic of meningitis, free preventive injections and vaccinations are being given from now on.</p>
<p>Egg Milk Oatmeal Factory Offers Preferential Treatment to Teachers</p>
<p>Each machine-made egg milk oatmeal produced by the Jiqing factory contains 1% protein, 73% starch, and 16% vitamins. It is resistant to hunger and can be cooked with rice. It is economical and hygienic. In order to give preferential treatment to the education sector, the price is set at 18 yuan per catty delivered. First, accept 1,000 priority customers, limited to school teachers and staff. In addition, the factory's on-site sales of this film do not require delivery power, so it is specially raised to subsidize student loans, sent once every four weeks.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>Your column previously published "A reader's letter stating that the number of receipts for changing vehicle licenses is inconsistent," which contained the phrase "Go to the Transportation Section of each administrative office to handle various procedures for changing licenses." It is found that the transportation section of this department originally handled vehicle license business, but it has been ordered by the municipal government to transfer all of it to the Public Utilities Bureau on February 16. Now this matter of changing licenses is no longer handled by this department. We are deeply afraid that people from all walks of life will misunderstand, so we hereby declare.

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>True people are born lazy to write, and for letters, they only seek not to lack affection and righteousness, and do not like to write too much. Therefore, diaries are not often made. I do not know why, in Showa 13, from January 1st to the end of the year, I continued to write diaries almost every day, and there are still a few remnants left.</p>
<p>This year, he was already twenty years old, and his grade had risen from No. 2 to the highest grade, No. 1. It was an era of high spirits. The diary was just an ordinary common diary at that time for five cents a book, but the articles and handwriting were very clear. There are very few places to delete and add, which may be a habit developed in Etajima. In the military school, the two tasks of writing workbooks and writing suitable end feelings are not allowed to be amended by a single word.</p>
<p>In the page of January 1st, at the beginning of the year, it is written that "must be spiritual, spirited, persevering, and upright."</p>
<p>If the entire diary for the year is introduced, everything about life in the military school can be understood, and it is also a very interesting thing, but due to the length limit, only the main points can be revealed below.</p>
<p>January 6 (Thursday) Sunny</p>
<p>Held a military parade. The morale is high, which is indeed the decoration of the beginning of Showa 13. We must move forward step by step and abide by our duties. With the grateful mood of the day of the imperial visit (Note: When receiving the imperial parade in Kashima). I am very excited about the training of the squadron and the world situation. We must fulfill the great mission of the empire. Please see our young people who bear the brilliant glory of the Japanese Empire. The British and American navies are not worth mentioning. Resolutely build the world's number one navy. No sleeping, from the new year.</p>
<p>January 7 (Friday) Cloudy with occasional snow.</p>
<p>Started rigorous training. Starting with gun and sword techniques, I felt uncomfortable in my body and felt very tired during class time. I fell asleep at the beginning of the year, which is very embarrassing.</p>
<p>We must cheer up, but our strength is still insufficient.</p>
<p>January 13 (Thursday) Clear after snow.</p>
<p>In the morning, I trained in sword techniques. It is also a happy thing to sweat under the snowflakes. We must work harder.</p>
<p>Floating navigation air balloons, measuring high-altitude meteorology, the weather is very cold, and it is really unbearable to stand in the snow on the training ground.</p>
<p>Judo training, full of energy, very happy, no matter what, work hard, and interest will arise. Everything must be like this.</p>
<p>January 20 (Friday) Warm and sunny.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was still raining, but it was sunny. The martial arts training in the morning was very pleasant. We must be enthusiastic. We still feel that we are not enthusiastic enough during class time. We went to the squadron supervisor's office to print during self-selection. Because we did not do well, we suffered an unexpected failure. We must trust others, but when we are responsible for ourselves, we must check it. Trust is acceptable, but over-trust is not acceptable.</p>
<p>Still napping. Unacceptable. (II)</p>
<p>February 9 (Wednesday) Cloudy and cold</p>
<p>It's really cold weather. Today is my father's birthday. Visited Happoen. There are boundless emotions. Twelve years have passed. My father was only a first-grade elementary school student when he died, and now I am able to be in the world-renowned Naval Military Academy. Whose grace is this? It is the grace of the emperor, the grace of parents, and the grace of teachers. If you want to repay this grace, you must do your best. Please rest assured, I will consciously work hard.</p>
<p>Mother and brother are now living in Taiwan. May you be safe and protect the remains to return to your hometown. (Note: To welcome the heroic spirit of brother Zhenichiro)</p>
<p>February 11 (National Foundation Day) Sunny.</p>
<p>Woke up at half past four. Immediately ascended Mount Kotaka. The east will be white, and we will pay our respects to the imperial city from afar, shouting Long live the imperial country. In the distance of the morning clouds, the future of the empire is vast. If we do not rise up now, who will bear the heavy responsibility of the imperial country in extraordinary times? We vowed to be loyal and descended the peak. (Note: The phrase "If we do not rise up" appears dozens of times in the diary, but this is the first time. It is probably influenced by the lyrics of the school song.)</p>
<p>March 10 (Thursday) Cloudy after rain.</p>
<p>Affected by the completion of the exam, I was not in the mood to study hard. I passed the class time blankly. People are prone to mistakes when they are not nervous. This is often heard. We must strive to be diligent.</p>
<p>There is shooting training. My heart is not calm. The results are not good. We must pay attention when ticking. When we are not calm, ticking will definitely ruin the results. We should be humble and calm.</p>
