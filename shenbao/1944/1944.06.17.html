<h3>受敎育的機會</h3>
<p>我們希望中國將來成功一個富强的國家，就須先使全國同胞都有必備的知識，要使全國同胞都有必備的知識，必先使全國同胞都有受敎育的機會。目前的學校制度和學生的費用，已經使大多數人無法進學校。眼看許多學齡兒童不能求學，願意上述的靑年不能上進，眞使我們非常寒心。這是中國前途最大的間題。</p>
<p>本報承蒙讀者贊助，辦理助學運動，迄今六届，目的就在對於一般失學的學生有所幫助。總計六届受助的人數有一萬五千餘人，所付出的款數有五百四十餘萬元，這完全是讀者諸君的大德。學費一年一年增加，所以當每居辦理之時，總使我們感覺經費不够，心有餘而力不足。可是經過一番的努力，無數讀者各方面的援助，結果難關還能勉强渡過。因此，我們知道社會上的同情心是一致的，全中國同胞對於敎育下一代的熱心是一般的，從這一點觀察，中國一定含着無限的希望。</p>
<p>除了幫助靑年們進學校讀書之外，我們更時常關心他們平時的成績。因為我們說過：「讀者諸君捐助血汗金錢，受助學生把血汗的成績來答報，本報同人把血汗的工作來協助」。最近辦理學術演講會，在每星期日的上午十時，為受助學生補充課外知識，並且訓練他們的筆記能力，考查他們的平時學力。凡是受助學生，强迫地必須聽講兩次，做一次筆記，而許多學生都是自願報各聽講四五次的。第二次演講會是六月四日的星期日，這一天大風大雨，可是報名聽講的受助學生竟沒有一個缺席，有許多九時已到講堂，坐在前排，便於寫聽講筆記。讀者讀君所幫助的靑年是這樣的好學，諸位的捐款不是白費的。現在上海社會上還有焦數貧苦的靑年，不聲不響地正在刻苦求學，難道我們還忍心不加以援助嗎？當我們把這件事吿訴各方而的朋友後，許多講師們都自願抽出功夫來，多　一二次，講得多一些，更有許多朋友們自願擔任講師，替道般可愛的有志靑年們服務，眞是「有錢出錢，有力出力」。這種情况使我們辦事的人得到無限的愉快，使我們心靈上得到無限的安慰。</p>
<p>助學運動已經得到社會上的同情，已經成為目前最最迫切的工作。諸位貧苦的靑年們！不要害怕沒有受敎育的機會，拿出你們的眞實成績，拿出你們熱心求學的精神，社會一定有人來幫助的。諸位同胞們！敎育下一代是我們這一代的主要工作，使他們有受敎育的機會是我們最眼前最容易的一件事，而幫助熱心求學的淸寒子弟們，使他們能够上進，助學的效果，比任何其他事情，高過萬倍。我們願意盡十二分的力量，努力促其成功。</p>
<h3>塞班島迭遭襲擊陸上激戰進行中　日軍砲台重創敵戰艦</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日上午五時發表：來襲馬利亞納羣島之敵軍，十五日晨企圖於塞班上陸，前後二次，但於海面即被擊退。又敵於是日正午，曾三次來襲，現仍激戰中。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵軍機動部隊，發於五月十一日至十三日之間，對馬利亞納羣島之基地，以艦載機及艦隊加以執　砲擊與轟炸，復於十五日又來轟炸，終日不息，駐守當地之日軍部隊，雖曾英勇應戰，予敵痛烈打擊。然至十五日拂曉，敵於熾烈之砲艦掩護下，企圖登陸，其中一要曾靠近塞班島，當地日軍部隊立即奮勇邀擊，激戰後曾前後兩度迫敵退於海岸，敵軍更於是日正午前後，企圖實行第三次之登陸，當地日軍精銳正與敵激戰中。查敵機係由馬紹爾羣島塎埃茲林環礁方面之基地，飛越馬紹爾羣島內之日軍各基地及特魯克。加羅林等日方强力之各基地而來者，敵軍此次來攻馬利亞納深處，其　慾之强烈可見矣，然日本國內上下一心，防壁堅如鐵石，對此並無畏敵之感。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　據華盛頓電、美太平洋艦隊司令部十五日夜發表，有力之美軍部隊，於戰艦·巡洋艦·驅逐艦各數艘掩護下，於塞班島登陸。又據尼米茲司令部發表稱，以航母·基地機戰艦·驅逐艦所編成之機動部隊，對馬利亞絕羣鳥塞班·迭尼安等處猛烈砲擊後，美軍遂於塞班登陸，刻下仍激戰中，美軍方面受損害頗大。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　迭尼安島日軍砲台，十五日上午曾對掩護敵軍於塞班島登陸之戰艦，由側面加以猛烈砲擊，其一艘重創起火。</p>
<p>日機再度夜襲必阿克瓦庫迭</p>
<p>西南太平洋日軍某基地十六日中央社電　日機於十三日深夜，又往襲必阿克島及瓦庫迭島之敵陣地，必阿克島方面所投炸彈均命中目的地，瓦庫迭島方面則有五處被炸起火，日機均安返基地。</p>
<p>拉巴爾十六日中央社電　敵B24型機十九架，來襲拉巴爾，當地日軍即與之交戰，擊落其二架，另三架亦受創，日軍損傷輕微。</p>
<h3>敵機襲北九州　擊墜毀十架　朝鮮南部空襲無損失</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日上午八時發表：十六日上午二時頃，有由中國方面飛來之敵B29型及B24型機二十架左右，來襲北九州地方，日軍防空部立即邀繫之，擊落其數架，將其繫退，目方損失極其輕微。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日大本營十六日下午二時發表：十六長北九州地方戰况，至今已判明要項如次：　敵機之損失，被擊落七架，擊毀三架。　日軍除地上部隊戰死傷數人外，防空部隊及地上軍事設施幾無損失。　　敵機轟炸而起火之數處，已於十六日晨悉予撲滅。</p>
<p>軍事設施毫無損害</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　今最空　日本九州之敵機約二十架中，被繫落擊毀者計有十架，敵機是役已蒙重大打擊，日方損失極輕微。敵軍為與歐洲戰事相呼應，揚言對日反攻，駐渝美空軍此種遊擊戰術，於昭和十七年（氏三十一年）四月十八日美機來襲東京時，己吿慘敗。此次來　之敵機，立被日陸上部隊擊落七架，又五架已被擊毀，終於歸途隊地焚毀，而日方損害則極輕微，儘陸上部隊陣亡數名，負傷數名。此外陸上部隊及軍事設施豪未受損害，雖略有被炸起火，但經官民一致協力營救，結果今晨即完全撲滅。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　敵機此次曾企圖襲繫門司八幅附近之工塲地帶，但以上地域所受損失極輕，僅二三小工塲發生小火災，旋即被撲滅。又敵機為日軍防空砲火所阻，僅首炸小倉郊外之國民學校後，即行逃去。其剩餘炸彈多投於海內，此次來襲之敵機為數旣少，未得作集中攻擊，故以此觀，敵機此來乃企圖擾亂人心而已。</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　京城電話，朝鮮軍十六日下午三時三十分發表：十六日下午二時頃，有敵機數架來襲朝鮮南部，但我方未受損失。</p>
<p>襲小笠原敵機重創</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日本大本營十六日下午五時發表：敵機動部隊十五日下午來犯小笠原羣島，並空襲父島及硫黃島，當地日軍當即截擎，擊洛敵機十七架以上，日方損害極輕微。</p>
<p>日採掘鳥糞層</p>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　北海道農業試驗塲，為採掘五十萬之有機肥料燐酸，試塲技師山田氏，曾於去年十月組織監查團，由五處之無人島採取海島糞，加以分析，發現含有百分之十至百分之十五之燐酸成分，實騐施於農田之後，有一倍以上之效力，而此五島之島糞層，架約五尺，且皆露出於地面，距北海道甚近，運輸亦便，於明年之一年中，當可採取戰前國內消費量之一半，即五十萬噸。</p>
<h3>渡瀏陽河日軍進泊長沙外圍　渝美空軍受重大打擊</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　華中方面日軍，於五月廿七日自洞庭湖兩側，對渝第六第七戰區，展開進攻作戰，到處突破渝軍防綫，闖入處於瀏陽（長沙東方六十公里，湖南省中部要衝）東方地區，痛擊渝第九戰區野戰大隊，進而包圍瀏陽，刻正猛攻中。又日軍另一部隊，自周圍包圍長沙，力攻渝防衛軍。又日軍洞庭湖西側地區，攻陷沅江益陽等要衝後，進至洞庭湖南方要點之寗鄕附近，逐次壓迫渝第六戰區軍。在華日空軍則連日與陸上之部隊相互呼應，更進攻遂州·梁山·恩施等駐渝美空軍前進基地，復邀擊蠢動之渝機，予以重創。六月一日至十二日之間，擊落渝機二十一架，擊被六十八架，共計百四十三架。此外並炸沉炸毀滿載兵員及軍需之舟艇八十八艘，其中尤堪注目者，厥為十一日進攻遂川時，曾炸毀大型機四架，戰鬥機十八架，擊毀戰鬥機計三十五架。五月十二日奇襲遂用機塲時，復燒毀四十五架以上，炸毀停於該機塲之渝機一架。其後復探知渝軍又向遂川運來大批飛機，常於十一日上午四時，大舉急襲該地，排除該地渝軍熾烈防空砲火，一舉突入機塲上空，投彈轟炸軍事設施及重要地區，覆滅渝軍主力後，全機安返基地。日機於五月一閱月中之猛攻，業將美機於中國上空自主作戰之戰力，抹殺殆盡。六月以來·乃向印度方面求援。最近其現有機數約為八百架左右，然來及半月間，又被日機擊喪百四十三架。由此可知駐渝美機所受打擊如何重大。日機炸沉之大小舟艇八十八雙，係在洞庭湖岸及揚子江上獲得之戰果。由於船舶之大量喪失，渝當局受創殊重。又於此戰中，日機之自炸及米返基地者計八架云。</p>
<p>里斯本十六日中央社電　機重慶來電，渝軍當局十四日夜發表：　湖爾戰綫長沙外國防綫戰事，仍甚激烈。該市東方之日軍，十三日再向西方進攻，並强行度過瀏陽河，澈軍刻正於河畔與之激戰中。同時永安方面日軍，亦行南下，企圖渡瀏陽河，於十三日夜開始向長沙東北十公里之地點進攻，現雙方正於該地激戰中。長沙東方地區，如瀏陽西北及東南等各處，亦均在激戰中。又益陽方面之日軍，十三日夜於援軍到達後，即行攻擊寗鄕，刻在該市東北至西北地區交戰中。　河南戰綫日軍由大營向西行進，於十一日晨攻擊靈寶，繼而進攻閱鄕，而渝軍亦於十二日夜實行反攻，迄十三日激戰中。又嵩縣方面日軍，於援軍到達後，於十二日即開始向西進攻，刻渝軍正與之激擊中。</p>
<p>日軍實施波狀轟炸</p>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　中國戰錢之空戰，現已呈新穎相貌，蓋時間上殆不可能之今日，空襲時間，當着重於夜間，故當夜間將組成轟炸編隊，即由基地出擊，相互空襲彼此基地，於是遂展開激烈之夜間轟炸。日極精銳頗爲得宜，實施新戰術之波狀攻擊，所謂波狀攻擊者，即當空襲敵軍基地時，一隊轟炸後，稍隔間歇，再由另一隊轟炸，反覆施以攻擎，恰如波浪之起伏，故在夜間空襲時，中彈之目標火柱樹林相繼蔓延，此即可作後繼轟炸機隊之最好目標。一羣波狀攻擊去後，第二轟炸隊再作同樣之反覆攻擊，繼之第三次第四次作澈底之攻擊。由於超低空之波狀轟炸，遂川。衡陽·梁山·維陵·等地之渝美機，已無寗夜，震駭不已，此夜間之波狀攻擊戰法，自入月以來，尚為初次即已擊滅敵方空軍力一成以上，故美機咸被擊滅於日軍精銳之前，渝軍陸地砲火亦無策可施，除逃避外，別無他途云。</p>
<p>平江難民慘遭空襲</p>
<p>漢口十六日中央社電　日快速部隊十日　明攻佔長沙東北七十公里之平江縣城，當即從事安民工作，難民返歸者日衆。二日晚，渝美機隊對平江難民區盲目投彈，其中更以北美B25型機六架，卡其期P4型機十六架之猛炸市街，民衆死傷甚多。並以機搶掃射，致有大部份逃避遲緩之老人及婦女等受傷。由此肓目之　炸，渝美空軍之暴戾，已表露無遺。中國民衆對</p>
<h3>實部開始收集廢金</h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　大東亞戰爭已届決勝階段，欲期粉碎英美侵路之野心，須有賴全東亞各民族之共同努力，而近　戰爭之遂行，必有充分　貧之供應，尤以　　之　要更為急切。政府　局　鑒於斯，爰於四月　　　收集廢金屬辦法，通飭　省市政府，督同所屬遵　，近更為施行便利　，　擬有補充辦法公佈。　　部為該項事務之主管　　，聞已開始收集，以已　有廢鐵約二千斤，即將　獻國府以為各省市之先　。想各地在最短期內　　陸續有所獻納，數量定　可觀，於大東亞之復　，實有莫大之裨益也。</p>
<h3>土耳其外長　突然辭職</h3>
<p>安加拉十六日中央社電　海通社訊：土耳其外長曼里卓格魯業已辭職，遺缺由內閣總理薩拉卓格魯暫兼。曼氏於昨日　務會議時，決定辭職，　未經證實之消息稱，曼氏獲悉渠近日之政策，國務會議未加批准，遂提出辭呈。</p>

<h3>作戰非常要綱已全部實施日國內態勢愈益緊密</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　日本政府爲澈底加强國內態勢，二月二十五日曾於閣議中決定決戰非常措置要綱，嗣更謀急速實行各種具體方策，首于四月二十九日決定停止高級享樂之具體要綱，繼則如加配學童食糧，澈底利用空地，限制旅行，强化女子挺身隊制度及提倡學生常年勤勞服務等具體緊急方策，均一一見諸實行。十五日更決定廢除平時或長期計劃之事務及事業，至是，作戰非常實施要綱已吿全部實現，日本國內態勢，愈益緊密。</p>

<h3>德軍使用新武器　英倫連日遭空襲　無想駛員飛機初出現</h3>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞社引德官方戰報稱：昨晚及今晨英南部及倫教區，均籠罩於德方所擲一種新式重爆發彈之下。</p>
<p>日內瓦十六日中央社電　德國新聞社引倫敦電訊：英內相莫里遜今日向英下院宣稱，德方已開始利用無駕駛員之飛機以攻英。渠繼稱，昨晚所這遇之空襲殊屬嚴重，總方曾於星期二晨以該項飛機襲英，並於昨晚及今晨以較多無駕駛員之飛機來犯，英方於首次遭遇該項飛機襲攻時，民衆死傷者有數人。昨晚之空襲更屬顯明，但尙無詳報，英方已盡最大之努力以謀對策。</p>
<h3>維爾河兩岸激戰　德精銳反攻順利　白俄志願軍在北法前錢參戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十六日中央社電　海通社訊：倫敦方面報告透露反軸心軍加緊準備大舉攻法之行動，反軸心國惟恐蒙高茂莢將軍開始大規模攻勢之前，德上將羅美爾或將先下手爲强，實施大規模之反攻，目前柯張特與蒙特堡區內繳戰方酣。</p>
<p>柏林十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：英軍自蒙受重大損失後，十五日上午僅在一狹隘之地區，繼續其坦克軍之猛攻，均被擊退。在維勒斯波卡洽附近發動反攻之德軍，向西北方面大有推展，蒂萊仍在德軍手中。自珂豪特（Caumont）克恩迤北全區，直至蒂萊爲止之英軍，仍處於被動地位。企圖由巴勒洛向桑洛推進之美軍，曾使用大量坦克車與摩托化砲隊，以强大之主力經編隊，意圖獲得編續進展，經苦戰後突破若干缺口，但不久即被堵合，以致其突破至桑洛之計劃完全失敗。在卡倫坦區作戰之白俄志願軍，係曾經優良之訓練者，努力擊退强大美軍之進攻。</p>
<h3>近代戰術中橋頭堡意義</h3>
<p>東京十六日中央社電　德軍當局曾發表反軸心軍粟將奧納及維爾兩河問之英軍橋頭堡，與柯坦汀半島西南部之美軍橋頭堡連結成功。橋頭堡者乃爲掩護渡河點之陣地，此點出自法國一九四〇年夏秋之交。德軍進攻蘇聯時，曾設橋頭堡於作戰規模廣凡之近代戰中，橋頭堡乃表示作戰根據地之意。最初之橋頭堡，僅爲登陸作戰之根據地，通稱爲戰術作戰之橋頭堡，其後又成爲重火器戰車等之主要部隊之陣地，因此爲某後主要作戰之根據地，故又稱爲戰時橋頭堡。英美軍於柯坦汀半島之岸頭部企圖連結一氣者在化乃該半島爲戰時橋頭堡者也。作成此項橋頭堡，雖發生甚大之損作戰上貢獻極大。客秋反軸心軍於義太土强行登陸時，在卡西諾及藤萊諾兩，亦往日爭得橋頭堡之所致也。設橋頭堡之際，多爲陸海空軍之緊密協力，此次北法作戰，反軸心軍先以轟炸與空戰部隊進攻，截斷德軍沿岸所守陣地，與後方之連絡，使之孤立。在登陸之際，又以主力艦爲基幹之海上部隊實行炮擊，用以掩護登陸部隊，因此反軸心軍在砲艦射程圈即在二十公里以內，擁有優勢艦隊勢力，對於設立橋頭堡比較有利，</p>
<p>這次一塲大病，幾幾乎把性侖都斷送了。現在這能偷生人間，眞是奇　。不過這樣危險的情形，都是病後醫生告訴我的。我自己在當時，決不知道而且沒有感覺到嚴實到這個程度。</p>
<p>在我一生之中，這次是第三次害大病了。第一次彷彿是九歲的時候。那待我父親宦遊福建，我隨母親住在沅陵鄉下。當時究竟害的是甚麼病，不僅現在記不起來，統是當時也未見得能够珍斷的明白。鄉下，不單是沒有西醫的影子，就是中醫，也是鳳毛鱗角。至於高明的醫生，更是打起火把也找不着。在鄉下糊裹糊塗請着不三不四的醫生醫治了一個多月，不單沒有起色，而且一天一天的沉重。於是用着轎子抬到城裹的觀或家中，去訪求名醫。當時所謂西醫，只有福音堂理的一個洋人。誰相信這個外國鬼子呢？老實說，那位美國洋人，恐怕醫這也不見得高明。遠親中間，有一位姓張的拔貢。在城裹設塾授徒，兼行醫道。他的醫道，微微有些名氣。於是就請他診視。大約也醫了一個多月，我這條小命，就被他救活了。我還記得我好了之後，父親還遠遠的由福建寄回許多東西，送他的課禮。這位張老先生的音容笑貌。我現在還很淸楚的記得。這便是我有生以來的第一次大病。第二次是民國十七年十一月間。這個時侯，我正辭去中央陸軍軍官學校政治部主任，到上海辦新生命月刋。有圖天正在月刋肚編閱稿件，忽然覺得頭重身然。回到家中，就發了高度的熟度，不能不睡下了。當時就請留日同學顧壽白診觀。他雖然是留東習圍的，而當時却在商務書館任編輯，並沒有開業。他診斷我是傷寒·傷寒，就是所謂腸窒抉斯，據說沒有特效藥可以醫治，全　着護和養生。我們當時雖從雜居的卡德路　福里的亭子問，搬到那待確實甚爲「摩登」而有衛生設備的霞飛坊，獨家居住，生活比較舒適，但是經濟的力量，究竟不容許我履用特別看護婦。一切看護之賣，只好偏勞淑慧了。前前後後，也隔一個多月，　慢慢有起色。這便是我有生以來的第二次大病。兩次大病，都不是專營醫業的醫生，而是儒而兼醫的先生所治愈，雖然是偶然，却也很湊巧了。</p>
<h3>病後</h3>
<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>這次的大病，病根早伏在幾個月之前。自從去年十一月由日本回國之後，就覺胸前室塞，呼吸困難。淑慧放心不下，請醫生把身體各部，用X光綫一一檢查，據說都很正常而健康，不過心藏稍有擴大之勢，却也不甚嚴東。但是以後氣喘胸塞，却一天一天的嚴重起來，朋友們都要我休息，醫生不待說是勸得更厲害。但是我的身體，那裏是我自己的呢？我那裹有隨時休息的自由呢？要會的客，不能不會，要開的會不能不開，要看的公事，不能不實；要說的話，不能不說；要嘔的氣，不能木嘔。其中最傷神的要算是說話和嘔氣了，在這種情形之下，那理可以任意休息？木過醫生還是請的，藥還是吃的。有些朋友說西醫好，有些親還是中醫見效。我是性急的人，西醫幾天醫不好，就換中舊；中醫幾天不見效，又換西醫。甚至中醫剛出門，西醫馬上就隨美進來了。有時上午服西藥，下午服中藥。這樣烏烟瘴氣的鬧了幾個月。好在飯也能吃，覺也能睡，事也能做，不過氣喘胸塞，血壓過高而已，所以沒有認爲是怎樣嚴重的問題</p>
<p>三月四號，忽然傷起風來，頭痛鼻塞，全身不適，五號更甚。但是決沒有因此停止工作。不僅照常做事，而且因爲一件要緊的臨待發生的事，不能不到上海。當天夜寧赴滬，在事上又受了凉。六七兩號，忙了兩天，七號晚咳嗽大作，數小時不停，直到深夜四時，　潮漸睡着。預定八號下午飛京，所以早上九時仍舊出門到行辦事。不過咳嗽情形，較之前晚，稍爲緩和。下午一時至機塲，因爲南京下陸不能飛行，遂改乘下午火車返京。返京以後，氣喘胸塞，雖然仍舊，而咳嗽却已大減。因此不在意中，仍舊照常活動。三月十二日　總理逝世耙念，前往謁陸。先一晚我和公博約好，早點動身。因爲上坡不易，如果人都來齊，行動不大方便。最好乘着還沒有人到的時候，我們可以緩步徐行。我七時即起，換上新國民服，驅車到陵國。不料公博已早上去。我慢慢的拾級而上。氣喘並不因之增加，也不覺得吃力。我暗中自慰道，「我的身體還算不壤」。祭陵之後，還要往祭革命烈土。下坡的時候，我和公博前行，後面隨着一大羣局志。大家步履很快，我們走在前面，也就欲慢而不可得了。於是如飛的跑下山坡，乘車赴蓋谷寺，下車之後，在人羣的前面。又是如飛的跑來跑去，全身出汗，加之冷風一吹，回家後就覺得不能支持，於是只好睡下。湊巧那天是星期日，可以休息了一個下午。十三日晨起，咳嗽雖然時發時止，但是並沒加劇。上午先後赴財部和中儲，照常辦事。下午召開物資統制審議委員會。遛個會，照例是要長時問的，常常下午三時開起，開到晚上七時以後。當天，我深怕不能支持，暗中打算如果中途實在不行，可以另請一位委員代我主席，我便可溜回休息。僥倖那天，只開了兩小時餘，就散會回家，但巳精疲力竭了。回家不久，田尻公使打電話來，希望見面。我實在不能會客了，約定次日上午十一時，在中儲見面。我打算次日行政院會議完畢，到中儲去和他晤談。當天晚上，咳嗽加劇，幾乎終宵沒有睡着。次晨出席行政院會議時，四肢非常無力，宣讀議案，幾至不能成聲了。散會到中儲，與田尻公使談話，當然是勉强支撐。他看我精神不佳，只談半小時，即行辭去。自從八號回京以後，朋友多說傷風咳嗽，中醫較佳，於是請了兩位中醫珍洽，中醫當然不用寒熱表量溫度，我自己也糊糊塗塗，沒有量過，而且決不相信會發熱。十四日下午我自己拿表來量，原來已有了三十入度多。於是我自己知道眞病了。心理作用眞厲害！不知道有熱度的待侯，還隨隨便便，沒有認眞當做病去醫，知道了有熟度，立即覺得孩嗽，病勢加重，不可再不認眞醫治了。我本定十六日赴滬的，現在決定中止，並電話淑　，立即來京。入晚，眞的，咳嗽更厲害了，沒有停過三分鐘。急了，去請同仁會醫院院長土屋博士。我以前有病，都是他看的。這次因爲是小的傷風咳嗽，不願意麻煩他進位頂忙的醫生。現在却不能不請他了。湊巧那晚他不在家，又沒有留下去處，他家裏人也沒有法子去尋。常晚竟徹夜咳嗽，沒有止過。十五日上午他來了，診說之後，不發一言，面有憂色。我問他一里期內，是否可愈。他輕描淡寫的說恐怕要多費些時間。下午再來看一次。當晚病勢好像愈益加重。聽說淑惡當晚夜車晋京，次晨可到。我的神志有些不淸了，彷彿淑慧來了，彷彿士屋又來診視。不久之後，彷彿床的四周，立着三四個穿黃色軍服的人，幾個穿白衣的看護婦，我覺得他們甚爲忙亂。在我床上架了一個架子，要照X光綫。照的時侯，他們要我停止呼吸，我居然也會停止。好久之後，覺得有個身材高大的穿軍服的人對我說道：「請閣下安靜的睡着，不要亂動。看護　留着伺侯。」後來我纔知道土屋博士，看我病太沉重，一個人不敢作主，去和日本軍總司令的軍醫部長商量。軍醫部長桃井中將，遂會同土屋博士帶了兩名軍醫官，兩個看護婦能來診治。後來又聽說他們曾經商量了半天，究竟入院還是在家。各有好處，也各有不便。最後他們遂決定在家，他們輪流每天上午，下午和晚上，來潰三次，並留兩名看護婦服侍。以後因爲兩人忙不過來，又添了一人。和我說話的那位身材高大的軍官，便是桃井中將。後來大家談起來，都以爲這次的病，僥倖是發作在南京，如果發作在上海，恐要一怕命嗚呼了！因爲在上海一定人多口雜，你說道個醫生好，他說那個醫生行。甲鑒藥中醫，乙介紹西醫，病急亂求醫，亂服藥，那有不敗事的道理！</p>
<p>原來我這次的病，是念性肺炎，兼之以心臟病，來勢狠猛。桃并中將治了幾天，也不敢作主，遂報告日木大使館，電東京專請名醫來華珍治。日本陸軍當局和大東亞省商量，遂請帝大教授，心錢病種威坂口博士，即日飛京。因爲天氣的關係，兩三天不能飛，直到二十三日綫到京診治。僥倖這幾天之中，病勢已穩定，沒有加劇，熱度且稍下降。桃井和土屋，都是坂口的學生，所以醫生雖然有三個人，意見却容易一致，決沒有某人堅持自己的主張，某人客氣，不發表意見的毛病。三人盡量發表意見，然後由坂口下結論，所以這次的大病，順利治愈，這也是個原因。否則，各持己見，恐怕連藥方也不能開出了</p>

<h3>中國靑少年之進路</h3>
<p>— 友松圓諦</p>
<p>本月六日在國立上海大學講</p>
<p>發揮東洋道德</p>
<p>我已屢次反復向諸君說過要喚醒中國的古典精神；但那並不是只勸大家研究儒教和彿教，而是要大家先本那精神以條養自身。與其尊重政治，不如尊敬迫德。無論研究什慶科學技術的人；也必須要先實踐中國傳統的聖賢之通。與其追求閥跡的捷經，不如先修養自己來得重要。東洋的道德是出發於修身齊家而擴大到治國平天下的。不能治心中賊的人，怎樣能够減亡心中之賊呢？其有廉潔的精神是好的。沒有　顏回那樣甘於淸貧的靑年，怎樣能置這中國於泰山之安呢？公正無私的精神是決不可缺，不專顧到到到自己一人的利害，而獻身於鄉黨社會和國家，是非常重要的。</p>
<p>千五百年以前，自中國學習過這「君子聖賢之通」的日本民族，並不把它放在書架上，而是在日常生活上加以實行的。自然，在中國也有很高尙的君子。至於大學生與靑年，在實行這一點，我敢自信日木靑年似乎稍勝一　。敝國的靑年學生，是更知道尊敬年齒，和道德的敬老尊師的美風，一點也沒有變化，雖曾一時因然歐化主義有過危臉的時代，但十年來，已恢復到以前的狀態。沒有這樣的靑年的純情，廉減，無私和禮節，中國怎樣會有光明的將來呢？正州衣感，政洽良心，與愛民的精神，這是三民主義的根木。主　雖已宜傳。而實行實不容易，我對諸位中國的　平，所期待者在此。</p>
<p>固然，我對然君未　於好的環境是知道的，所以我也必須想到固守　那樣腐舊的公正廉　·是不能發跡的。但我認爲必須先忠於自己的良心·堅守目己的節操，然後新中國的原動力才能湧起。正直的小學生，純潔的中學生，公正無私的大學生，一畢了業，不久便在會官污更之間亂混　，這樣的情形不改，中國怎樣會有光明呢？我所切望於諸君的，在光養成高尚的道德。與其尊敬權力財力，不如尊敬有德的人。應該分別偽善和眞善，應該尊敬甘於淸費而從事於各教的人。諸君今日應該尊敬什麼人好呢？這個問題大概尚夫解決。我以爲應尊敬那死後連半畝田也沒有的人物，和與民衆同苦的人物，而自己也成爲其中之一，這樣才可以救濟這個中國</p>
<p>日木的教育，是以對於皇室之絕對的皈依爲其中心的。然旦更多提示許多可以尊敬的人物。中國的靑年，現在究竟應該尊敬誰呢？孔孟，孔明，孫中山·計都可以的·但應穗淸自己的目標。自然，現在生存　的中國人　汪先生，我也認爲是僅大的。諸位之中一定有在意中　出電曰種尊敬之對　的吧？可是，一提起中國的靑年，則在他們的胸中似乎不大有可以尊敬的人物似的。他們好像對於人物甲乙的月旦特別具有典味。然而學生們必先尊敬自己的先生，學老師的模樣上級所做的，下級生應該模　，那裏便是中國本來的古典精神。決不可迷於一歐美思想的自由民　。對於意中所構成的尊敬的人物應該統近他，企圖與他同等·所謂「見賢思齊」。與其讀政治學，不如精謮古今君子聖賢的傳記。</p>
<p>這樣的道德修身之說，諸君從基督教會的外國宣教師也曾應過的吧？我感謝在中國所造就的這些然身的宣教師。然而可惜，他們到底既不是中國人也不是東洋人。所以中國靑年便自然要尊敬外國的人物。把東洋稱神看做低劣的東西，這是大人的罪過。關於這樣的道義，東洋方面是更爲高尚的。派造那些宣揚道義的宣教師的金錢，是從榨取中國的　餘而來的。而今我們因這戰爭幸而能够爲東洋確保其思想的自由。人們從其自身來說，或從其思想來說，這假東洋都是遠勝於西洋的。這個優越的證據，便是大來亞戰爭十年的成績。</p>
<p>日本這個國家，是皮於有趣之地位的。是佛教與儒教和神道這三種思想，渾然一和的國家。佛教是印度文明，儒教是中國的文明，神道是日本原始以來的思想。今日大東亞十億的民衆，可以大別之由以上三種文明來加以彩色的。然而這三種文明，都是具有三千年五千年之歷史，而且又能互無矛盾地調和。日木便是其調和的好例。恐怕這一二種文明與今後大東亞戰爭的經過至於勝利終結。會渾然地創造出「大來亞文明」來的吧。今日諸君之學問的任務，應該以這「大東亞」爲對象。應該深深　識這「大東亞的中國」。自然·西洋學問也是不能忘却參考的。但其主要目標必須代之以「大東亞」，這是諸君學間的任務？如剛才所說，我是一個佛教學的專門家，倘若耍將佛教的例來說，則出發於印度的佛教，有成爲西域，中國，蒙古。滿洲，朝鮮，日本的北方佛教，大乘佛教；又發於印度而行於緬甸，泰國，安南，蘇門答　，爪哇的，大槪是南方佛教，小乘佛教，自然不小乘措雜的地方也有的。這樣佛教雖擴展於全地域，而其中心思想是一點也不改變的。那便是「利自已心之否定」·即無我的根本歷年。「無私奉公」，以及儒教道教的中心思想，於是就　關和起來了。因此我們便能接觸到大東亞精神的共通性。「東洋精神是什麽呢」？這是今後諸君的題目。我在這裏如果詳細地答復這個質間，恐怕要減少諸君的興味。所以只想說幾　可以參考的東西而已。</p>
<p>東洋的共同精神，是出發於「和」的一大調和的綜合之姿。中國佛教的前輩，也有稱它爲「圓」，爲「中」的。利己心的否定，是中心思想，所以對於物的想法不是分析的。無論權利和義務都好，那種推諉卸資的議論是不幹的。無論訛做壤事，都是大家的責任，這是」一體」，「一如」，「不二」，「相即相人」的說法。中國之亂，是日本應負責任的。是感謝與　任之交流。　尚未能像西洋思想那樣放到冷靜的分析理論之上去。眞理是分析以上的柬西，人生的實相不是可以言語文字來表現的。那裏便是東洋的直觀的世界。那寶　便有大東亞諸民族之溫和的握手。從前五千年間，這種思想的共榮圈業已存在，是到今日才成覺到的。諸君應該學取這東洋的精神。想對敬愛的中國靑年要說的話　在很多。但今日實在使諸君在這裏坐得太久了。許多的話，想留待下次來說。以上是偶然想出的三四種·只是說出了我的率直的無飾的希望。今後中國日本這兩個業魂希望要使它更加接近。我自己的長男已經大學畢業，所以今天我覺得是對着我的長男的友人說話似的。諸君之道今後是險阻的。諸軍知道這困難的前途，希星先學大東亞，先學日木，而尤其重要的是要先學中國五千年的文化，要知道　門　崗的石佛，何以價値如此之高，並且希望能在現代再造出中國的文化來。最後，敬祝諸君的健　（完）</p>
<h3>松島部長闡述太平洋戰況</h3>
<p>並駁斥敵方誇大宣傳</p>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部，於昨日下午二時，循例招待中國記者，松鳥部長對於太平洋戰況及英·美軍在默洲侵略作戰情沉，闡述如后。。日本本士空防嚴密</p>
<p>第一·美國陸軍部於十五日發表華盛頓電報稱，美國第二十轟炸　隊　　型轟炸機，已曾轟作日本本土云云，根據今晨日木大本營發表·美機曾至北九州　炸。大約開指此而言。美　　　型飛機在中國發現時。已早知其有侵襲日本本土之計劃，以北九州警戒嚴密，敵毫未得逞，反被擊落敵　數架。美國屢以報復珍珠灣之恥　爲理由·鼓動國民。此種鼓動，極爲空泛，尤其在夜間空　，更無效果。對日太木土不但毫無損害，反益增日人同仇敵氣之心，在完遂戰爭上，殊予日人以良好之結果。太人以戰爭愈益演成白熱化深爲愉快。內綫作戰以逸待勞</p>
<p>第二，關於寒班方面戰鬥情形，美國　傳美太平洋艦隊業已上陸說，日絕不承認。該方面作戰極關重要，日木方面而言，能將敵方引誘到內綫，即孫十所請「以逸待勞」，故敵方能到日木本土來，非特勿　驚慌。反可使吾人歡欣。關於作戰眞相，嗣後當詳細發表，不過敵人之過於誇大宣傳，以其所捏造之驚人數字·雖爲敵人一慣手段，但吾人亦須加以注意。譬如六月十三日路透社稱，在馬里亞納羣鳥附近，擊沉日艦艇十三隻，繫破十六隻云云，實則當時日艦艇並無在該處行動情事，其宦傳方法，不膏爲卓別林式的喜劇作風而已。</p>
<p>澈底實踐戰時生活</p>
<p>第三，敵方以在歐洲侵略作戰，未後效果，頓爲焦灼，故希望在太平洋方面作擴大宜傳，以引全世界之注意·尤其想　絡中國之人心。但今後戰局將越發嚴重，即在上海方面，無論何時，遭邁空襲·都能不生障碍，如有此種準備，必須打消一切奢侈習慣，澈底寶踐戰時生活，以期達到最後勝利之目的。北法德軍作戰順利</p>
<p>第四，英美軍在歐洲登陸後已有十一天了，截至目前的情況，英加兩軍在奧納河西岸起，至維爾河附近造成橋頭堡，此外美國以降落傘部隊爲中心的美國軍隊，在瑟堡東方某地區亦造成橋頭堡，激戰中心地爲克恩·巴猶·卡倫坦等地，橋頭堡最深者不過四十公足，各地均受德軍的猛烈反攻，英美軍刻均在繼續苦門中。德軍在維爾河下游以洪水戰術及航空戰予敵人以重大之打擊，德軍沉着作戰，進行極爲順利，並抱有極大的自信心。已完成登陸的英美軍隊共有三十個師團，其中包括英美最精銳部隊在內，恐此爲其主力部隊，此外尚有數方預儒隊二十備師團，將從何處登陸，頗爲一有趣味的問題。根據敵方宣傳，似乎有在南法或巴爾幹登陸計劇，前天美國驅逐艦會駛至阿得里亞海，但據現在情况判斷，恐現在之北法戰塲，即爲將來之主要戰塲，將來英美的運命，殆即在此處決定云。敵方最近目標，在奪取瑟堡港，但登陸已將兩週，尚未達到與瑟堡港接近之地點，本人相信德軍可　此機會重予敵人以鄧扣克之打繫也。</p>

<h3>病後</h3>
<p>看護得法，也是這次病愈的一個原因。三位看護婦，實在認眞，實在負責，晝夜不息的輸流侍候。尤其是看護長中島女士·更是細心，更是親切。病劇的時候，她甚至於急得迎飯都吃不下，病勢鬆動，她便喜形於色。不單是我個人，就是我一家，對她們都很感激。因為有了她們，家中自淑　以下許多人，省了多多少少的事。她們一直看護到五月一號，纔吿辭回院。</p>
<p>病嚴重的時候，當然鎖　禁止見客，就是輕鬆以後，普通的人，仍不許見，公博等朋友來，也不過寥寥數語面已，到了四月二號以後，　能於臥榻上與公博商量處決要事，三號以後，始准看報。</p>
<p>坂口博士，看見我巳經脫了危險時期，四月五日，特來吿辭，謂東京事忙，打算六號赴滬，七號飛回。他於診治最後一次後，吿訴我說，這次不死，眞是奇蹟。因為患肺炎的人，每分鐘呼吸到四十次以</p>
<p>（第二版轉下）上，已經危險了，如到了五十次以上，必死無疑。而我有三天，竟到了六十二三次！現在肺炎雖已吿愈，心臟仍不健全，所以他又吿訴我許多病後義生的方法。他路過上海時，去看公博，說我道次得救，不是他們醫生的力量，乃是我的運氣。他要公博轉告我，遝氣只能有一回，希望我以後特別注意。這位六十多歲的老翁，為我飛來飛去，心裏眞是不安。</p>
<p>以後使一天一天的進步了。中間雖然病翻了兩次，惹得大家緊張了兩回，但是旋即平復。於是練習在床上起坐，練習下床行走，練習吃乾飯，精神一天好似一天。醫生以前每日來三次，四月一號以後，每日兩次，七號以後，每日便只來一次了。每次診治我右脅下面時，桃井和土屋，兩位都很認眞，我心裏覺得很懷疑。直到四月二十三號，土屋纔吿訴我右脅下，有肋膜炎的現象，以前不敢吿訴我。直對二十日，纔聽不出有肋膜炎的症兆。</p>
<p>看獲婦打開紗窗，飛進來許多柳絮，忽然感到春己暮了。要看護婦扶到窗前一看，花園中已是錦草如茵，綠葉成蔭子滿枝的時候了。今年桃紅柳綠的良辰美景，我竟在病榻中銷磨過去，不能賞玩，眞是辜負了大好春光。</p>
<p>朋友都來慶賀，都說大難不死，必有後福。其實，我這次不死，是幸或是不幸，還是問題。也許天不許我輕容易的脫離苦海，要在苦海中，使我再受些磨折，再受些災難，纔讓我離此濁世，也未可知。也許天不許我壽終正寢，而必使我將來橫遭慘死，或死於非命，亦未可料。記得民國二十年或二十一年的時候，楊暢　（永泰）和熊式輝奉召由滬飛贛，剛纔起飛，就失事墮地，兩人墮地重傷，醫了好幾月，纔能復原。我看見暢鄕，也以大難不死，必有後福的話祝賀他。他以為這話靠不住，並吿訴我他廣東鄕下的一件事。有一老翁，臨河家居，某晚山洪暴發，屋宇冲倒，某翁臥一床板上面，流了幾十里，被人救出。不到半年，晚上出外大解，失足跌入糞坑中，因而致死。某翁不死於淸流，而死於冀坑，所以前次之不死，不能說是幸了。說這個故事的暢卿，以後在三省剿張總部，雖也大權獨攬，煊赫一時，不能不說是後福，但是結果還是在漢口被人暗殺，飲彈而亡。我決不希望機福。在這戰火延及全世界的時候，誰也不要希望享福。而且在人民陷於水深火熱的時候，個人希望享福，仁者的用心，也不應如此。我當認為這次已經死了。今後的我，已經不是我的我了。所以今後更可以不顧成敗利鈍，不問毀譽得失，本着自己的信念，為國家效忠，為民族努力，以免負此殘生。</p>
<p>病後　記這次的經過，以作將來的紀念。五月二十六日（轉載古今半月刋第四十九期）</p>
<p>海軍畫家　（二）</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪洋譯</p>
<p>（我縱然當不了　屬家和畫家也不要。）</p>
<p>心情這樣決定後，隆夫的日常生活，比以前反更像藝術家了，但這一點，本人却感覺不出來。</p>
<p>他很努力用功。當不能去寫生時，就研究前輩的海畫。然而正像市來畫家所說，日本對於海洋畫家之少，只有令人驚奇。也可以說，現代甚至一位海洋畫也沒有。故世的前田寬治這位畫家的作品「海」，他雖然佩服，然而發現他並非是海洋專門畫家這一點，却使隆夫大失所望。絡果，名符其實的畫家，他認為只有東城釭太郎一個人。東城畫家喜歡舉軍艦和每戰，這眞是非當中隆夫的意。</p>
<p>在這一個期間內，他知道了一外國海洋畫家。在丸善　店找到「海事畫家」一書，這是開端。他高興得手舞足蹈，而手不釋　地注視着原色版和照片。這在畫中，收集着英國的赫密，維麗，德國的白爾根等許多畫家的作品。該　畫册中，有　得非常微妙的波濤和雲露，快艇和商船，以及威武堂棠的軍艦。隆夫最感困難的問題，如軍艦首的前進姿勢，划波姿勢，艦尾的拖曳波紋姿勢等，然而現在却很容易地一一解決了。極雷於海的感受性，而如果對船和軍艦的知識不正確，則是不能　船的。謮到卷未的介紹時，才知道這批書家全都沒有普通　家的經歷。白爾根是　水幾的艦長。維爾金遜畫家軍是海軍迷彩（Camouflage）的發明家。旣有那樣　富的海軍知識，所以對於最新式巡洋艦的美，比如都先感到·必誰都書得真確。</p>
<p>（用普通的用功方法，是不行的。）</p>
<p>夫逐漸明白了書工的三昧境，逐漸理解了工作的底蘊。海洋畫家這樣的難當，心中有點不安。如不學習一個專門而更深入畫境，則自己總是過意不去</p>
<p>（是的，我雖然沒有坐過軍艦，而反來要盡軍艦。因為沒當上海運士官，所以才畫海戰。）</p>
<p>最後的主意業已　定。他覺醒要當海軍置家</p>
<p>於是，他就常常道橫須賀去。這是爲了推敲和研究洛種船艇的類型，海軍軍人的氣魄和動作。同時爲了要　得我　過軍艦，而就買來一本「軍艦照片薄」，爲了研究水雷和炮彈的爆炸以及水柱，而就一再地去參觀美國海軍示威電影。當明瞭近代海戰的本體時，又必須再研究潛水艇和飛</p>
<p>隆夫一天也不休息也繼績用功。這樣過去了兩年。（一〇一）李阿毛衛生信箱</p>

<h3>Opportunities for Education</h3>
<p>We hope that China will succeed as a strong and prosperous nation in the future, and to achieve this, we must first ensure that all our compatriots possess essential knowledge. To ensure that all compatriots have essential knowledge, we must first ensure that all compatriots have access to education. The current school system and student fees have made it impossible for most people to attend school. It is truly disheartening to see so many school-aged children unable to seek education and so many aspiring young people unable to advance. This is the biggest problem facing China's future.</p>
<p>Thanks to the support of our readers, this newspaper has organized scholarship assistance campaigns for six sessions, with the aim of helping students who have dropped out of school. In total, over 15,000 people have been assisted in the six sessions, with over 5.4 million yuan spent. This is entirely due to the great virtue of our readers. Tuition fees increase year by year, so we always feel that the funding is insufficient and that we cannot do as much as we would like each time we organize these campaigns. However, through effort and the assistance of countless readers from all walks of life, we have managed to overcome the difficulties. Therefore, we know that there is unanimous sympathy in society and that all Chinese compatriots are generally enthusiastic about educating the next generation. From this point of view, China certainly holds unlimited hope.</p>
<p>In addition to helping young people attend school, we also regularly monitor their academic performance. As we have said, "Readers donate their hard-earned money, assisted students repay with their hard-earned achievements, and the staff of this newspaper assist with their hard-earned work." We recently organized academic lectures to supplement the extracurricular knowledge of assisted students every Sunday morning at 10 a.m., and to train their note-taking skills and assess their usual academic ability. All assisted students are required to attend at least two lectures and take notes once, but many students voluntarily register to attend four or five times. The second lecture was on Sunday, June 4. That day, there was a strong wind and heavy rain, but not a single assisted student who had registered to attend was absent. Many arrived at the lecture hall as early as 9 a.m. and sat in the front row to facilitate taking notes. The young people that our readers are helping are so eager to learn, so your donations are not in vain. There are still many poor young people in Shanghai society who are quietly studying hard. Can we bear not to help them? When we told our friends about this, many lecturers volunteered to take the time to give one or two more lectures, and many friends volunteered to be lecturers to serve these lovely and aspiring young people. It is truly a case of "those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." This situation gives us organizers infinite joy and gives us infinite comfort in our hearts.</p>
<p>The scholarship assistance campaign has already gained the sympathy of society and has become the most pressing task at present. Poor young people, do not be afraid of not having the opportunity to be educated. Show your real achievements and your enthusiasm for learning, and society will surely help you. Compatriots, educating the next generation is the main task of our generation. Giving them the opportunity to be educated is the easiest thing we can do, and helping aspiring and impoverished students so that they can advance. The effect of scholarship assistance is ten thousand times greater than anything else. We are willing to do our utmost to promote its success.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2 p.m. on the 16th: The following are the main points of the battle situation in the northern Kyushu region as of today: The enemy's losses were seven aircraft shot down and three destroyed.

<p>Military Facilities Undamaged</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Of the approximately twenty enemy planes that attacked Kyushu, Japan, today, ten were shot down and destroyed. The enemy suffered a major blow in this operation, while Japanese losses were extremely minor. In an attempt to coordinate with the war in Europe, the enemy announced a counterattack against Japan. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had already suffered a miserable defeat with these guerrilla tactics when U.S. planes attacked Tokyo on April 18, Showa 17 (1942). The enemy planes that came this time were shot down by Japanese ground troops.

The number of enemy planes that attacked this time was small, and they were unable to launch a concentrated attack. Therefore, from this perspective, the enemy's attack was only an attempt to disturb the people's morale.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): A dispatch from Seoul reports that the Korean Army announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 16th: Several enemy planes attacked southern Korea around 2 p.m. on the 16th, but we suffered no losses.</p>

<p>Japan Extracts Seabird Guano Deposits</p>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency): In order to extract 500,000 units of organic phosphate fertilizer, the Hokkaido Agricultural Experiment Station, under the leadership of technician Yamada, organized an inspection team last October to collect seabird guano from five uninhabited islands and analyze it. It was discovered that it contained 10% to 15% phosphoric acid. When experimentally applied to farmland, it had more than double the effectiveness. The guano layer on these five islands is approximately five feet thick, and all is exposed on the surface. It is very close to Hokkaido, and transportation is also convenient. In the coming year, it should be possible to extract half of the pre-war domestic consumption, or 500,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Crossing the Liuyang River Advance to the Outskirts of Changsha; U.S. and Chongqing Air Forces Suffer Heavy Blows</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): Japanese forces in Central China, on May 27th, launched an offensive operation from both sides of Dongting Lake against the Sixth and Seventh War Zones of the Chongqing government. They broke through the Chongqing army's defensive lines everywhere, entered the area east of Liuyang (60 kilometers east of Changsha, a key point in central Hunan province), inflicted heavy damage on the Ninth War Zone's field units, and surrounded Liuyang, which they are currently attacking fiercely. Another unit of the Japanese army is encircling Changsha from the surrounding areas, attacking the Chongqing defensive forces. In the western Dongting Lake area, Japanese forces, after capturing key points such as Yuanjiang and Yiyang, advanced to the vicinity of Ningxiang, a key point south of Dongting Lake, gradually pressuring the Sixth War Zone army. The Japanese Air Force in China has been coordinating with the ground forces every day, further attacking the forward bases of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, such as Suining, Liangshan, and Enshi, and intercepting any Chongqing planes that move, inflicting heavy damage on them. Between June 1st and 12th, they shot down 21 Chongqing planes and destroyed 68, for a total of 143. In addition, they sank or destroyed 88 boats and ships loaded with soldiers and military supplies. Of particular note was the attack on Suichuan on the 11th, where they destroyed four large aircraft and 18 fighter planes, and destroyed a total of 35 fighter planes. During a surprise attack on the Suichuan airfield on May 12th, they burned more than 45 aircraft and destroyed one Chongqing plane parked at the airfield. Later, it was discovered that the Chongqing army had transported a large number of aircraft to Suichuan again. On the morning of the 11th, they launched a large-scale rapid attack on the area, overcoming the intense anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army, breaking into the airfield airspace, and bombing military facilities and important areas, destroying the main force of the Chongqing army before all planes safely returned to base. The Japanese Air Force's fierce offensive in May has almost completely wiped out the U.S. Air Force's ability to operate independently in the skies over China. Since June, they have been seeking assistance from India. Recently, their current number of aircraft is approximately 800, but in just half a month, another 143 have been shot down by Japanese planes. This shows how serious the damage suffered by the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been. The 88 large and small boats and ships sunk by Japanese planes were the result of battles on the shores of Dongting Lake and the Yangtze River. Due to the massive loss of ships, the Chongqing authorities have suffered a significant blow. It is also reported that eight Japanese planes were self-destructed or failed to return to base in this battle.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency): A telegram from Chongqing reports that the Chongqing military authorities announced on the night of the 14th: The fighting on the Changsha outer defense line of the Hu'er front is still very fierce. Japanese forces east of the city launched another westward offensive on the 13th and forcibly crossed the Liuyang River. The Chongqing army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them on the riverbank. At the same time, Japanese forces in Yong'an are also advancing south, attempting to cross the Liuyang River, and began attacking a location ten kilometers northeast of Changsha on the night of the 13th. Both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting in that area. In the eastern Changsha area, such as the northwest and southeast of Liuyang, fierce fighting is also taking place. Japanese forces in the Yiyang area, after reinforcements arrived on the night of the 13th, immediately attacked Ningxiang and are currently engaged in fighting in the northeast to northwest areas of the city. On the Henan front, Japanese forces advanced west from Daying, attacking Lingbao on the morning of the 11th and then attacking Yuanyang. The Chongqing army launched a counteroffensive on the night of the 12th and fought fiercely until the 13th. Japanese forces in Song County, after reinforcements arrived, began advancing west on the 12th, and the Chongqing army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with them.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Implement Wave Bombing</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): The air war on the China front is now taking on a new look. Because it is almost impossible to carry out airstrikes during the day, the emphasis is now on nighttime attacks. Therefore, bombing formations are organized at night and take off from their bases to attack each other's bases, leading to fierce night bombing. The elite Japanese forces are well-suited to implement the new tactic of wave attacks. A wave attack means that when attacking an enemy base, one team bombs, and after a short interval, another team bombs, repeatedly attacking, just like the rise and fall of waves. Therefore, during nighttime airstrikes, the flames and forests of the targets hit by the bombs spread in succession, providing the best target for subsequent bomber teams. After one wave attack leaves, the second bombing team repeats the same attack, followed by the third and fourth times to carry out a thorough attack. Due to the ultra-low-altitude wave bombing, the Chongqing and U.S. aircraft in Suichuan, Hengyang, Liangshan, Weiling, and other places have no peace at night and are terrified. This nighttime wave attack tactic, since the beginning of the month, has already destroyed more than 10% of the enemy's air power on its first application. Therefore, U.S. planes are being destroyed by the elite Japanese forces. The Chongqing army's ground artillery has no countermeasures and has no choice but to flee.</p>
<p>Pingjiang Refugees Suffer Tragic Airstrike</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): The Japanese rapid forces occupied Pingjiang County, 70 kilometers northeast of Changsha, on the 10th. They immediately began to work to reassure the people, and the number of returning refugees increased daily. On the night of the 2nd, Chongqing and U.S. aircraft blindly dropped bombs on the refugee area of Pingjiang. In particular, six North American B-25 aircraft and sixteen Curtiss P-40 aircraft fiercely bombed the city streets, causing many civilian casualties. Machine gun strafing caused injuries to a large number of elderly people and women who were slow to evacuate. This blind bombing fully reveals the violence of the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces. The Chinese people are against</p>
<h3>The Industry Ministry Begins Collecting Scrap Metal</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency): The Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. To crush the Anglo-American ambition to invade, it is necessary for all nations of East Asia to work together. And for the conduct of modern warfare, a sufficient supply of resources is essential, especially the critical need for metals. In light of this, the government Industry Ministry, in April, issued a notice to all provincial and municipal governments ordering them to collect scrap metal and to ensure their subordinates followed the policy. Recently, supplementary measures were drafted to facilitate implementation and were promulgated. The Industry Ministry, as the competent authority for this matter, is reported to have begun collecting scrap metal. So far, it has about 2,000 kilograms of scrap iron, which it will soon donate to the National Government as an example for all provinces and cities. It is hoped that various places will continue to make contributions in the shortest possible time. The quantity will be considerable and will be of great benefit to the recovery of Greater East Asia.</p>

<h3>German Forces Use New Weapons; London Suffers Airstrikes for Days; Pilotless Aircraft Appear for the First Time</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing an official German war report, stated: Last night and this morning, southern England and the London area were covered by a new type of heavy exploding bomb dropped by the Germans.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Central News Agency): The German News Agency, citing a London dispatch, stated: British Home Secretary Morrison announced in the British Lower House today that the Germans have begun using pilotless aircraft to attack England. He continued, "The air raid encountered last night was particularly serious. The Germans attacked England with this aircraft on Tuesday morning, and attacked with more pilotless aircraft last night and this morning. In the first encounter with the aircraft attack, several people were killed or injured. Last night's air raid was more obvious, but there is no detailed report yet. The British side has made the greatest efforts to devise countermeasures."</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles on Both Banks of the Vire River; Successful Counterattacks by Elite German Troops; White Russian Volunteers Join the Battle at the Northern French Front</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, 16th: A Huitong News Agency report from London reveals that the Allied forces are intensifying preparations for a large-scale offensive in France. Fearing that General Montgomery might launch a large-scale offensive first, German General Rommel might strike first with a large-scale counterattack. Currently, fierce battles are raging in the areas of Carentan and Montebourg.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 16th: A German News Agency report states that after suffering heavy losses, the British army continued its tank assaults on a narrow area on the morning of the 15th, but were repelled. German forces launched a counterattack near Villers-Bocage, making significant advances to the northwest. Tilly remains in German hands. The British forces in the entire area from north of Caumont to Tilly remain on the defensive. American forces attempting to advance from Balleroy towards Saint-Lô used a large number of tanks and motorized artillery units, forming a strong main force to attempt continuous progress. After bitter fighting, they broke through several gaps, but they were soon closed, resulting in the complete failure of their plan to break through to Saint-Lô. The White Russian volunteers fighting in the Carentan area are well-trained and are striving to repel the powerful American advance.</p>
<h3>The Significance of Bridgeheads in Modern Tactics</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 16th: German authorities have announced the successful link-up of the Allied bridgeheads between the Ona and Vire rivers and the American bridgehead in the southwestern Cotentin Peninsula. A bridgehead is a position that protects a river crossing point, a concept that originated in France during the summer and autumn of 1940. When the German army attacked the Soviet Union, they established bridgeheads. In modern warfare with vast operational scales, a bridgehead represents an operational base. The initial bridgeheads were merely bases for landing operations, commonly referred to as tactical bridgeheads. Later, they became positions for major units equipped with heavy artillery and tanks, thus becoming the bases for subsequent major operations, hence they are also called wartime bridgeheads. The Anglo-American forces' attempt to link up their beachheads on the Cotentin Peninsula aims to transform the peninsula into a wartime bridgehead. Creating this type of bridgehead, although incurring significant losses, contributes greatly to the operation. During the Allied forced landing in Italy in the autumn, the gains at Cassino and Terracina were also due to the establishment of bridgeheads. Establishing a bridgehead often involves close cooperation between the army, navy, and air force. In the current North French campaign, the Allied forces first used bombing and air combat units to attack and cut off the German coastal defenses from their rear lines, isolating them. During the landing, naval forces based on battleships carried out artillery bombardments to cover the landing troops. Therefore, the Allied forces, possessing superior naval strength within the range of naval guns, i.e., within 20 kilometers, had a comparative advantage in establishing bridgeheads.</p>
<p>This recent serious illness almost cost me my life. It's truly a miracle that I'm still alive. However, I only learned about the severity of the situation from the doctor after I recovered. At the time, I had no idea and didn't feel that it was that serious.</p>
<p>This was the third time in my life that I had suffered such a major illness. The first time was when I was about nine years old. At that time, my father was serving as an official in Fujian, and I was living with my mother in the countryside of Yuanling. I can't remember what illness I had then, and even at the time, it wasn't clear what it was. In the countryside, there were no Western doctors, and even Chinese doctors were rare. As for skilled doctors, they were impossible to find. We vaguely sought treatment from unqualified doctors in the countryside for more than a month, but not only did my condition not improve, it worsened day by day. So, I was carried in a sedan chair to relatives' homes in the city to seek out famous doctors. At the time, the only so-called Western doctor was a foreigner at the Gospel Hall. Who would trust this foreign devil? To be honest, that American foreigner probably wasn't a very skilled doctor either. Among our distant relatives was a Zhang, a "bachelor of tribute" (拔貢). He ran a school in the city and practiced medicine on the side. He had a slight reputation as a doctor. So, we asked him to diagnose me. After treating me for about a month, he saved my life. I remember that after I recovered, my father sent back many gifts from Fujian to thank him. I still remember the face and smile of that old Mr. Zhang very clearly. That was the first major illness I had in my life. The second time was in November of the Republic of China Year 17 (1928). At that time, I had just resigned as the director of the political department of the Central Military Academy and had gone to Shanghai to start a new magazine, "New Life Monthly." One day, I was editing manuscripts for the magazine when I suddenly felt a heaviness in my head and body. When I got home, I developed a high fever and had to lie down. I asked Gu Shoubai, a classmate from Japan, to diagnose me. Although he had studied medicine in Japan, he was working as an editor at the Commercial Press at the time and wasn't practicing medicine. He diagnosed me with typhoid fever. Typhoid fever, also known as enteric fever, supposedly has no specific cure and relies entirely on nursing and recuperation. Although we had moved from a shared room in a Shikumen building on Carter Road (卡德路) to a more "modern" residence with sanitary facilities in the Avenue Joffre (霞飛坊), where we lived alone in a lane house, and our life was relatively comfortable, our financial resources didn't allow me to hire a special nurse. All the nursing duties had to be shouldered by Shuhui. It took more than a month before I slowly began to improve. That was the second major illness I had in my life. Both times, I wasn't treated by doctors who specialized in medicine, but by gentlemen who were scholars and doctors. Although it was accidental, it was also quite coincidental.</p>
<h3>After the Illness</h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>The root of this recent serious illness had been present for several months. Since returning from Japan last November, I had felt tightness in my chest and difficulty breathing. Shuhui was worried and asked a doctor to examine my body with X-rays. According to the doctor, everything was normal and healthy, but my heart was slightly enlarged, although not severely. However, the shortness of breath and tightness in my chest worsened day by day. Friends advised me to rest, and doctors, needless to say, urged me even more strongly. But my body wasn't my own. I didn't have the freedom to rest whenever I wanted. Meetings that needed to be attended couldn't be missed, conferences that needed to be opened couldn't be postponed, official documents that needed to be read couldn't be ignored, words that needed to be said couldn't be left unsaid, and anger that needed to be vented couldn't be suppressed. Among these, the most mentally taxing were speaking and venting anger. Under these circumstances, how could I freely rest? However, I still consulted doctors and took medicine. Some friends said that Western medicine was good, while others believed that Chinese medicine was more effective. I am an impatient person. If Western medicine didn't work in a few days, I would switch to Chinese medicine. If Chinese medicine didn't work in a few days, I would switch back to Western medicine. Sometimes, I would take Western medicine in the morning and Chinese medicine in the afternoon. I went on like this for several months. Fortunately, I could still eat, sleep, and work. It was just that I had shortness of breath, tightness in my chest, and high blood pressure, so I didn't think it was a serious problem.</p>
<p>On March 4th, I suddenly caught a cold, with a headache, stuffy nose, and general discomfort. It was even worse on the 5th. But I didn't stop working because of it. Not only did I continue to work as usual, but also, because of an important event that was about to happen, I had to go to Shanghai. I took the night train to Shanghai that night and caught a cold again while working. On the 6th and 7th, I was busy for two days. On the evening of the 7th, I had a severe cough that lasted for hours, until I finally fell asleep around 4 a.m. It was scheduled for me to fly to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 8th, so I still went out to handle some business at 9 a.m. However, the cough was slightly less severe than the previous night. At 1 p.m., I went to the airport, but because it was raining in Nanjing, the flight was canceled, so I took the afternoon train back to Nanjing. After returning to Nanjing, the shortness of breath and tightness in my chest were still present, but the cough had decreased significantly. Therefore, I didn't pay much attention to it and continued to be active as usual. On March 12th, it was the memorial service for Premier Sun Yat-sen, and I went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. The night before, I had agreed with Chen Gongbo to leave early because it was difficult to walk uphill, and it would be inconvenient if everyone arrived at the same time. It was best to take advantage of the fact that no one had arrived yet so that we could walk slowly. I got up at 7 a.m., put on my new Zhongshan suit, and drove to the mausoleum. Unexpectedly, Chen Gongbo had already gone up early. I slowly climbed the steps. My shortness of breath didn't increase, and I didn't feel tired. I comforted myself, "My body is still not bad." After the memorial service, we had to go to pay respects to the revolutionary martyrs. When going downhill, Chen Gongbo and I walked ahead, followed by a large group of officials. Everyone was walking quickly, and we were in front, so we couldn't slow down even if we wanted to. So, we ran down the hillside as fast as we could, took a car to Gegu Temple, and after getting out of the car, we ran back and forth in front of the crowd. I was sweating all over, and when a cold wind blew, I felt like I couldn't hold on after returning home, so I had to lie down. Coincidentally, that day was Sunday, and I could rest for the afternoon. On the morning of the 13th, although the cough came and went, it didn't get worse. In the morning, I went to the Ministry of Finance and the Central Reserve Bank to handle some business as usual. In the afternoon, I convened a meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee. These meetings usually took a long time, often starting at 3 p.m. and lasting until after 7 p.m. That day, I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to hold on, so I secretly planned that if I really couldn't make it midway, I could ask another member to take over as chairman, and I could sneak away to rest. Fortunately, the meeting only lasted for two hours before it ended, and I went home, but I was already exhausted. Soon after returning home, Ambassador Tani called, hoping to meet. I really couldn't receive guests, so I scheduled a meeting for 11 a.m. the next morning at the Central Reserve Bank. I planned to go to the Central Reserve Bank to meet with him after the Executive Yuan meeting was over the next day. That night, my cough worsened, and I barely slept all night. When I attended the Executive Yuan meeting the next morning, my limbs were very weak, and I could barely speak when reading the proposals. After the meeting, I went to the Central Reserve Bank to talk with Ambassador Tani, of course, with great difficulty. Seeing that my spirits were not good, he only talked for half an hour before leaving. Since returning to Nanjing on the 8th, many friends had said that Chinese medicine was better for colds and coughs, so I consulted two Chinese medicine doctors. Of course, Chinese medicine doctors don't use thermometers to measure temperature, and I myself was confused and didn't measure it either, and I didn't believe that I would have a fever. On the afternoon of the 14th, I took a thermometer and measured it myself, and it turned out that I had a fever of over 38 degrees. Then I knew I was really sick. The psychological effect is really amazing! When I didn't know I had a fever, I was casual and didn't take the illness seriously. Once I knew I had a fever, I immediately felt that my cough and illness had worsened, and I couldn't help but take it seriously. I had originally planned to go to Shanghai on the 16th, but now I decided to cancel it and called Shuhui, asking her to come to Nanjing immediately. In the evening, my cough really got worse, and it didn't stop for more than three minutes. Anxiously, I went to ask Dr. Tsuchiya, the director of the Tongren Hospital. He had treated me for illnesses before. This time, because it was just a small cold and cough, I didn't want to bother such a busy doctor. But now I had to ask him. Coincidentally, he wasn't at home that night, and he hadn't left his whereabouts, so his family couldn't find him either. I coughed all night, without stopping. On the morning of the 15th, he came, and after examining me, he didn't say a word, and his face was worried. I asked him if I could recover within a week. He lightly said that it would probably take more time. He came to see me again in the afternoon. That night, my condition seemed to worsen further. I heard that Shuhui was taking the night train to Nanjing that night and would arrive the next morning. My mind was a little unclear. It seemed that Shuhui had come, and it seemed that Tsuchiya had come to examine me again. Soon after, it seemed that there were three or four people in yellow military uniforms and several nurses in white standing around my bed. I felt that they were very busy. They put a frame on my bed to take an X-ray. When they were taking it, they asked me to stop breathing, and I actually stopped. After a long time, I felt a tall man in military uniform say to me: "Please rest quietly, don't move around. The nurses will stay and take care of you." Later, I learned that Dr. Tsuchiya, seeing that my illness was too serious, didn't dare to make a decision on his own, so he went to consult with the chief medical officer of the Japanese military commander. The chief medical officer, Lieutenant General Momoi, accompanied Dr. Tsuchiya and brought two military doctors and two nurses to treat me. Later, I also heard that they had discussed for a long time whether to be hospitalized or at home. Each had its advantages and disadvantages. In the end, they decided to stay at home. They took turns coming three times a day, morning, afternoon, and evening, and left two nurses to serve me. Later, because two people were too busy, they added another person. The tall officer who spoke to me was Lieutenant General Momoi. Later, everyone talked about it, and they all thought that it was lucky that this illness broke out in Nanjing. If it had broken out in Shanghai, I was afraid that I would have lost my life! Because in Shanghai, there would definitely be many people talking at once. You would say that one doctor is good, and he would say that another doctor is good. A would recommend a Chinese medicine doctor, and B would recommend a Western medicine doctor. In a medical emergency, people would seek medical help indiscriminately and take medicine indiscriminately, which would inevitably lead to failure!</p>
<p>It turned out that my illness this time was lobar pneumonia, combined with heart disease. It came on fiercely. After Lieutenant General Momoi treated me for a few days, he didn't dare to make a decision on his own, so he reported to the Japanese Embassy and telegraphed Tokyo to specially invite a famous doctor to China for treatment. The Japanese army authorities and the Ministry of Greater East Asia discussed it and invited Professor Sakaguchi, a heart and blood vessel disease expert at Tokyo Imperial University, to fly to Nanjing immediately. Because of the weather, they couldn't fly for two or three days. It wasn't until the 23rd that they arrived in Nanjing for diagnosis and treatment. Fortunately, during these few days, my condition had stabilized, hadn't worsened, and the fever had decreased slightly. Momoi and Tsuchiya were both Sakaguchi's students, so although there were three doctors, their opinions were easily unified. There was no problem of someone insisting on their own opinion or someone being polite and not expressing their opinion. The three of them expressed their opinions as much as possible, and then Sakaguchi made a conclusion, so this was also a reason why this serious illness was successfully cured. Otherwise, if everyone had their own opinions, I'm afraid they wouldn't even be able to prescribe a prescription.</p>

<h3>After the Reorganization of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, the Organization Will Be Adjusted; Plans to Establish a Daily Necessities Control Commission</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the control of materials, the National Government reorganized the National Commerce and Trade Control Commission, and officially issued an order to appoint Wen Huaisha as the chairman and transferred Ku Shoutong, the former chairman, to the position of supervisor. The internal organization of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission will be streamlined to undertake the task of guiding and supervising all material control tasks. It will serve as a research, planning, and comprehensive organization. Its major material sectors will be directly under the Executive Yuan and reorganized into control committees. Currently, the Commerce and Trade Control Commission has received orders to begin the handover, preparing for the new leadership to take over.</p>
<p>Internal Adjustment</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the commission, the internal organizational structure will be adjusted because the major material sectors are all directly under the Executive Yuan. Therefore, it has been decided to reduce the scope and merge the original five departments, namely the General Affairs Department, the Association Affairs Department, the Finance Department, the Materials Department, and the Audit Department, into three departments: General Affairs, Materials, and Audit. The position of chief secretary under the council will be abolished and replaced with a graded secretary system. Several groups will be established under the three departments.</p>
<p>Material Control</p>
<p>The flour, wheat, oil, grain, and sugar professional committees, which originally belonged to the foreign organizations of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, have been reorganized into the Flour and Wheat Control Commission by the government, and Sun Zhongli has been specially appointed as the director. The Oil and Grain Professional Committee will also be reorganized into a control committee. However, in order to centralize control, the authorities may merge it into the Flour and Wheat Control Commission in September. The Cotton Industry Management Office, which was organized under the Commerce and Trade Control Commission, will be merged into the Cotton Control Commission and reorganized into the Cotton Industry Control Commission. The Sugar Industry Professional Committee will be reorganized into the Sugar Industry Control Commission. It is said that in order to complete all material control, the government plans to establish a Daily Necessities Control Commission to implement control over matches, soap, candles, and other daily necessities, centralizing production and consumption. It is internally determined that Li Zufan will be the chairman. Although the above control committees are directly under the Executive Yuan, they are subject to the guidance, supervision, research, and planning of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission.</p>
<p>Wen's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the newly appointed Chairman Wen Huaisha to inquire about the date of taking office and his aspirations for future material control. He said that Chairman Ku Shoutong is ready to end his mission and will take over immediately. There will be no changes in personnel, because the staff of the past Commerce and Trade Control Commission have been able to competently handle everything with their service spirit and talent. As for the future task of material control, it will require the cooperation of all directors, supervisors, and relevant authorities. He (Wen Huaisha referring to himself) is not one to talk much, but his ambition is to do things successfully.</p>
<h3>The Rice Control Commission Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan to Facilitate the Collection and Transportation of Rice</h3>
<p>Rice and Grain Limited to Area A</p>
<p>The source of rice in the city has been relatively abundant in recent days, and the market price has slightly declined. The authorities have submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan to order the provincial governments to instruct their subordinates to facilitate rice merchants in collecting and transporting rice from various places, regarding transportation and procurement. The number of ordinary citizens applying for temporary certificates from the Rice and Grain Control Commission is overwhelming, and rice carried into the city by porters is constantly on the way.</p>
<p>Facilitating Procurement</p>
<p>It is said that local authorities in various places seem to be restricting the export of rice purchased by rice merchants in this city. The Rice and Grain Control Commission has petitioned the Executive Yuan to request the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to instruct their subordinates to facilitate rice merchants holding the commission's passports without any restrictions, so as to make adjustments smoothly.</p>
<p>Important Notice for Obtaining Certificates</p>
<p>Since the free transportation of rice and grain of five dou or more and ten dan or less has been approved, the number of ordinary citizens going to the Rice Control Commission to apply for temporary transportation permits is extremely crowded. In order to facilitate citizens in applying for temporary permits, the commission's procurement department has formulated several points that applicants must pay attention to and announced them to the public: * Those who come should strictly observe order according to the order of arrival and must not rush ahead. * They should present their citizen ID card for verification in order to issue the permit. * Rice and grain are limited to Area A, that is, Suzhou, Wujiang, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Jinshan, and Taicang areas, and the suburbs of this city. * Each certificate requires a stamp tax of one yuan. * At the end of the certificate period, it must be returned to the commission on time. * The amount of food prepared by citizens for themselves must not exceed three months per capita. All citizens who obtain temporary rice and grain transportation permits must fill in the details on the form, including their name, ID card number, address, rice and grain type, quantity, place of departure, and place of arrival, and submit them together with their citizen ID card. They can pick up the entry permit the afternoon of the following day.</p>

<h3>The Path Forward for Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>— Yuusong Entai</p>
<p>Delivered on the 6th of this month at the National Shanghai University</p>
<p>Promoting Eastern Morality</p>
<p>I have repeatedly told you all to awaken the classical spirit of China; but that is not just advising everyone to study Confucianism and Buddhism, but rather to first use that spirit to nurture yourselves. It is better to respect morality than to respect politics. Even those who study science and technology must first practice the ways of the sages and wise men of Chinese tradition. It is more important to cultivate oneself than to pursue shortcuts to fame. Eastern morality starts with self-cultivation and family management, and expands to governing the country and bringing peace to the world. How can one eliminate the thieves in one's heart if one cannot subdue the thief within? It is good to have a spirit of integrity. How can China be placed as securely as Mount Tai without young people who are as content with poverty as Yan Hui? A spirit of impartiality and selflessness is indispensable. It is very important to not only consider one's own interests, but to dedicate oneself to the local community, society, and the nation.</p>
<p>Fifteen hundred years ago, the Japanese people, who learned the "ways of the gentleman, sage, and wise man" from China, did not put it on a bookshelf, but practiced it in their daily lives. Of course, there are also very noble gentlemen in China. As for university students and youth, I dare to say that Japanese youth seem to be slightly better at practicing this. The young students in my country know even better how to respect the elderly and have the beautiful tradition of respecting teachers and elders, which has not changed at all. Although there was a dangerous period when they were temporarily influenced by Europeanization, they have returned to their previous state in the past ten years. How can China have a bright future without such pure,廉減, selfless, and courteous youth? 正州感, political conscience, and the spirit of loving the people are the roots of the Three Principles of the People. Although the principles have been widely spread, it is not easy to put them into practice. This is what I expect from all of you Chinese.</p>
<p>Of course, I know that you are not in a good environment, so I must also consider that adhering to such outdated justice and integrity cannot lead to success. But I believe that one must first be true to one's own conscience and uphold one's own integrity, and then the driving force of the new China can emerge. If upright elementary school students, pure middle school students, and impartial and selfless university students are soon mixed up among corrupt officials after graduation, how can China have a bright future if this situation does not change? What I earnestly hope from you all is to cultivate noble morality. It is better to respect people of virtue than to respect power and wealth. One should distinguish between hypocrisy and true goodness, and should respect those who are content with poverty and engage in various pursuits. Who should you respect today? This question is probably still unresolved. I believe that one should respect those who have no land left after their death, and those who suffer with the people, and become one of them, so that China can be saved.</p>
<p>Japanese education is centered on absolute devotion to the Imperial Family. But it also offers many figures that can be respected. Who should Chinese youth respect now? Confucius, Mencius, Zhuge Liang, and Sun Yat-sen are all acceptable, but one should clarify one's own goals. Of course, I also consider Mr. Wang, who is currently alive in China, to be great. Surely some of you have a target of respect in your minds? However, when it comes to Chinese youth, it seems that there are not many figures in their hearts who can be respected. They seem to have a particular taste for judging the merits of people. However, students must first respect their teachers, and lower-classmen should imitate what their teachers and superiors do. That is the original classical spirit of China. It is absolutely forbidden to be misled by the freedom of European and American thought. One should approach and strive to be equal to the respected figures that one has in mind, which is called "seeing a virtuous person and thinking of becoming equal to them." Instead of reading political science, it is better to read the biographies of gentlemen, sages, and wise men of ancient and modern times.</p>
<p>You have probably also heard such talk of moral cultivation from foreign missionaries of Christian churches? I am grateful for these devoted missionaries who have been cultivated in China. However, unfortunately, they are neither Chinese nor Easterners after all. Therefore, Chinese youth naturally respect foreign figures. It is the sin of adults to regard Eastern gods as inferior. In terms of such morality, the East is even more noble. The money used to send those missionaries who promote morality comes from exploiting the surplus of China. Now, thanks to this war, we are fortunate to be able to secure the freedom of thought for the East. People, whether from their own perspective or from their thoughts, this pseudo-East is far superior to the West. The evidence of this superiority is the ten years of the Great East Asia War.</p>
<p>Japan is in an interesting position. It is a country where Buddhism, Confucianism, and Shintoism are harmoniously integrated. Buddhism is Indian civilization, Confucianism is Chinese civilization, and Shintoism is the original thought of Japan. Today, the one billion people of Greater East Asia can be broadly divided and colored by the above three civilizations. However, these three civilizations all have a history of three to five thousand years, and they can also harmonize with each other without contradiction. Japan is a good example of its harmonization. Perhaps these one or two civilizations, along with the progress of the Greater East Asia War leading to its victorious conclusion, will create a "Greater East Asia Civilization." Today, the task of your scholarship should be to take this "Greater East Asia" as the object. One should deeply understand this "Chinese of Greater East Asia." Of course, Western knowledge cannot be forgotten for reference. But its main goal must be replaced by "Greater East Asia." This is the task of your scholarship? As I said just now, I am a specialist in Buddhist studies. If I were to give an example of Buddhism, Buddhism originated in India and became Northern Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism in the Western Regions, China, Mongolia, Manchuria, Korea, and Japan; and it originated in India and spread to Burma, Thailand, Annam, Sumatra, Java, mostly Southern Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism, and naturally there are also places where Theravada Buddhism is mixed. Although Buddhism has spread throughout the region in this way, its central idea does not change at all. That is "the negation of one's own mind," that is, the fundamental historical significance of selflessness. "Selfless devotion to public service," as well as the central ideas of Confucianism and Taoism, are thus intertwined. Therefore, we can come into contact with the commonality of the spirit of Greater East Asia. "What is the Eastern spirit?" This is the topic for you all in the future. If I were to answer this question in detail here, I am afraid it would diminish your interest. So I just want to say a few things that you can refer to.</p>
<p>The common spirit of the East starts with "harmony," a great harmony of synthesis. The predecessors of Chinese Buddhism also called it "roundness" and "center." The negation of self-interest is the central idea, so the way of thinking about things is not analytical. Whether it is rights or obligations, discussions that shirk responsibility are not suitable. Whether doing good or bad deeds, it is everyone's responsibility. This is the saying of "one body," "one suchness," "non-duality," and "interpenetration." China's chaos is the responsibility of Japan. It is an exchange of gratitude and任.尚 cannot be placed on the cold analytical theory like Western thought. Truth is beyond analysis, and the reality of life cannot be expressed in words. There is the intuitive world of the East. There is the gentle handshake of the peoples of Greater East Asia. In the past five thousand years, this sphere of co-prosperity of thought has already existed, and it is only today that it has become apparent. You should learn this Eastern spirit. There are many things I want to say to the beloved Chinese youth. But today I have really made you sit here for too long. I would like to leave many words for the next time. The above are just three or four kinds that I came up with by chance, and they only express my frank and unadorned hopes. In the future, I hope that China and Japan, these two 業 souls, will become even closer. My own eldest son has already graduated from university, so today I feel like I am talking to my eldest son's friends. Your path ahead is fraught with danger. Knowing this difficult future, I hope that you will first learn about Greater East Asia, first learn about Japan, and especially learn about the five thousand years of Chinese culture, to know why the stone Buddha at 　門　岡 is so valuable, and hope to recreate Chinese culture in the modern era. Finally, I wish you all good health (End)</p>
<h3>Director Matsushima Explains the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>And refutes enemy exaggerations</p>
<p>The Press Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, as usual, invited Chinese reporters at 2 PM yesterday. Director Matsushima explained the Pacific war situation and the invasion operations of British and American forces in 默洲 as follows. . Japanese mainland air defense is tight</p>
<p>First, the US Department of the Army issued a Washington telegram on the 15th, stating that the 20th Bombardment Squad of the US Army had bombed the Japanese mainland with　　-type bombers. According to the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters this morning, US aircraft had bombed 北九州　. It probably refers to this. When the US　　-type aircraft were discovered in China. I had long known of its plan to invade the Japanese mainland. 北九州 is heavily guarded, and the enemy has not succeeded at all, but has been shot down. The United States has repeatedly used the shame of retaliating against Pearl Harbor　 as a reason to agitate the people. This kind of agitation is extremely vague, especially in nighttime air　, and has no effect. Not only does it cause no damage to Japan, but it also increases the Japanese people's hatred of the enemy. It gives the Japanese a good result in completing the war. The 太人 is very happy that the war is becoming more and more heated. Inward operations wait for the enemy</p>
<p>Second, regarding the battle situation in the 寒班 area, the United States　 has reported that the US Pacific Fleet has landed, but Japan does not recognize this. The operation in this area is extremely important. As far as Japan is concerned, it can lure the enemy to the inner line, which is Sun Tzu's so-called "waiting for the enemy to be exhausted." Therefore, the enemy can come to the Japanese mainland, so don't　 panic. It can make us happy. The truth about the operation will be announced in detail later, but the enemy's exaggeration is too great. Although the surprising numbers it fabricates are a consistent method of the enemy, we must also pay attention to it. For example, Reuters claimed on June 13 that 13 Japanese warships were sunk and 16 were 系破 near the Mariana Islands. In fact, Japanese warships were not acting there at that time. Its eunuch-like propaganda method is just a Chaplin-style comedy style.</p>
<p>Thoroughly practice wartime life</p>
<p>Third, the enemy is anxious because of the lack of effectiveness of the invasion operations in Europe, so it hopes to expand propaganda in the Pacific to attract the attention of the world, especially to　 rope in the hearts of the Chinese people. But the war situation will become more and more serious in the future. Even in Shanghai, no matter when, encountering an air raid　 will not cause obstacles. If there is such preparation, we must eliminate all luxurious habits and thoroughly treasure practice wartime life in order to achieve the ultimate victory. German troops operate smoothly in Northern France</p>
<p>Fourth, it has been eleven days since the British and American troops landed in Europe. As of the current situation, the British and Canadian troops have created a bridgehead from the west bank of the 奥纳 River to the vicinity of the 維爾 River. In addition, American troops, centered on parachute troops, have also created a bridgehead in a certain area east of 瑟堡. The center of the fierce battle is in 克恩, 巴猶, 卡倫坦 and other places. The deepest bridgehead is only forty public feet. All places are subject to fierce counterattacks by the German army. The British and American forces are still in a difficult situation. The German army is calmly fighting in the lower reaches of the 維爾 River and using flood tactics and air battles to give the enemy a major blow. The German army is fighting calmly and is progressing extremely smoothly, and has great confidence. A total of thirty divisions of British and American troops have completed the landing, including the most elite British and American troops. This is probably its main force. In addition, there are several reserve teams of twenty divisions. It is quite an interesting question where they will land from. According to enemy propaganda, there seems to be a plan to land in southern France or the Balkans. American destroyers sailed to the Adriatic Sea the day before yesterday, but judging from the current situation, the current battlefield in northern France is probably the main battlefield in the future. The fate of Britain and the United States in the future is probably decided here. The enemy's recent goal is to seize the port of 瑟堡, but it has been two weeks since the landing and it has not yet reached a place close to the port of 瑟堡. I believe that the German army can seize this opportunity to give the enemy another Dunkirk-like blow.</p>

<h3>After Illness</h3>
<p>Proper care was also a reason for this recovery. The three nurses were truly conscientious and responsible, serving shifts day and night. Especially Nurse Zhongdao, the head nurse, was even more meticulous and kind. When the illness was severe, she was so anxious that she couldn't even eat. When the condition eased, she looked happy. Not only me personally, but my whole family is very grateful to them. Because of them, many people in the family, including Zi Shu, were spared a lot of trouble. They nursed me until May 1st before bidding farewell and returning to the hospital.</p>
<p>When the illness was severe, of course, visitors were strictly forbidden. Even after it eased, ordinary people were still not allowed to see me. When friends like Gongbo came, they could only exchange a few words. After April 2nd, I was able to discuss important matters with Gongbo on the bed. After the 3rd, I was allowed to read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Dr. Sakaguchi, seeing that I had passed the danger period, came specifically on April 5th to say goodbye, saying that he was busy in Tokyo and planned to go to Shanghai on the 6th and fly back on the 7th. After the last treatment, he told me that it was a miracle that I didn't die this time. Because for people with pneumonia, breathing 40 times per minute or more</p>
<p>(Continued on Second Edition) is already dangerous. If it reaches 50 times or more, death is inevitable. And for three days, I reached 62 or 63 times! Now that the pneumonia has subsided, the heart is still not healthy, so he also told me many ways to recuperate after the illness. When he passed by Shanghai, he went to see Gongbo and said that my recovery this time was not due to the doctors' efforts, but to my luck. He asked Gongbo to tell me that luck can only happen once, and he hoped that I would pay special attention in the future. This old man in his sixties flew back and forth for me, and I felt really uneasy.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I improved day by day. Although the illness relapsed twice, causing everyone to be nervous twice, it quickly subsided. So I practiced sitting up in bed, practicing getting out of bed and walking, practicing eating dry rice, and my spirits improved day by day. The doctor used to come three times a day, but after April 1st, he came twice a day, and after the 7th, he only came once a day. Every time he treated the area below my right rib, both Momoi and Tsuchiya were very serious, and I felt very suspicious in my heart. It wasn't until April 23rd that Tsuchiya told me that there was a phenomenon of pleurisy under my right rib, but he didn't dare to tell me before. It wasn't until the 20th that he couldn't hear any signs of pleurisy.</p>
<p>Seeing the nurse open the screen window, many willow catkins flew in, and I suddenly felt that spring was ending. Asking the nurse to help me to the window, I saw that the garden was already covered with brocade grass and green leaves, and the branches were full of fruit. This year's beautiful scenery of peach blossoms and green willows, I spent in bed, unable to enjoy it, and I truly wasted the great spring.</p>
<p>Friends all came to congratulate me, saying that those who survive a great disaster are bound to have good fortune in the future. In fact, whether my survival this time is fortunate or unfortunate is still a question. Perhaps heaven does not allow me to easily escape the sea of ​​suffering, but wants me to suffer more tribulations and disasters in the sea of ​​suffering before letting me leave this turbid world. Perhaps heaven does not allow me to die peacefully in my sleep, but will inevitably make me die tragically or unnaturally in the future, which is also unpredictable. I remember around 1931 or 1932, Yang Chang (Yongtai) and Xiong Shihui were summoned to fly from Shanghai to Ganzhou. Just after taking off, they crashed to the ground. Both of them were seriously injured and had to be treated for several months before they could recover. When I saw Changqing, I also congratulated him with the words "those who survive a great disaster are bound to have good fortune in the future." He thought that these words were unreliable and told me about an incident in his hometown in Guangdong. An old man lived by a river. One night, a mountain flood broke out, and the house collapsed. The old man lay on a bed board and floated for dozens of miles before being rescued. In less than half a year, he went out to relieve himself at night, accidentally fell into a manure pit, and died as a result. The old man did not die in the clear stream, but died in the manure pit, so the previous survival cannot be said to be fortunate. Changqing, who told this story, later held great power in the headquarters of the three provinces to suppress Zhang, and was powerful for a while, but in the end he was assassinated in Hankou and died by gunshot. I never hope for good fortune. At a time when the flames of war are spreading all over the world, no one should hope to enjoy good fortune. Moreover, when the people are trapped in dire straits, it is not the intention of a benevolent person to hope for personal happiness. I should consider that I have already died this time. The me from now on is no longer my me. Therefore, from now on, I can ignore success or failure, benefit or loss, praise or criticism, and based on my own beliefs, be loyal to the country and work hard for the nation, so as not to fail this remaining life.</p>
<p>Post-illness notes record this experience as a future memento. May 26th (Reprinted from "Ancient and Modern Semi-Monthly", Issue 49)</p>
<p>Naval Painter (2)</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>(Even if I can't become a wealthy family and a painter, I don't want to.)</p>
<p>After deciding on this mindset, Tatsuo's daily life was even more like an artist than before, but he himself didn't feel it.</p>
<p>He worked very hard. When he couldn't go out to sketch, he studied the naval paintings of his predecessors. However, as the painter Ichiki said, the small number of marine painters in Japan is surprising. It can even be said that there is not even one marine painter today. He admired the works of the deceased painter Kanji Maeda, "The Sea," but he was greatly disappointed to find that he was not a marine specialist painter. As a result, he believed that the only painter worthy of the name was Taro Tojo. The painter Tojo likes to depict warships and sea battles, which is exactly what Tatsuo intended.</p>
<p>During this period, he learned about a foreign marine painter. It began with finding the book "Marine Painter" in the Maruzen store. He was so happy that he danced with joy, and gazed at the color plates and photos with his eyes glued to them. In the paintings, there were collections of works by many painters such as Hermel and Veley of England, and Bergen of Germany. In the album, there were very subtle waves and clouds, yachts and merchant ships, and majestic warships. Problems that Tatsuo found most difficult, such as the advancing posture of the warship's bow, the wave-cutting posture, and the trailing waves of the warship's stern, were now easily solved one by one. Extremely sensitive to the sea, and if the knowledge of ships and warships is not accurate, then it is impossible to draw ships. When he read the introduction at the end of the volume, he realized that none of these writers had the experience of ordinary painters. Bergen was the captain of a submarine. The painter Wilkinson was the inventor of naval camouflage. Because they have such rich naval knowledge, they are the first to feel the beauty of the latest cruisers, and they must write more accurately than anyone else.</p>
<p>(Ordinary hard work is not enough.)</p>
<p>Tatsuo gradually understood the essence of hard work, and gradually understood the basis of work. He was a little uneasy in his heart about how difficult it was to become a marine painter. If he didn't study a specialized and more in-depth painting field, he would always feel sorry.</p>
<p>(Yes, although I have never been on a warship, I still want to depict warships. Because I didn't become a maritime officer, I paint sea battles.)</p>
<p>The final decision has been made. He realized that he wanted to become a naval painter.</p>
<p>Therefore, he often went to Yokosuka. This was in order to study and refine the types of various boats and ships, the spirit and actions of naval personnel. At the same time, in order to be able to draw warships, he bought a "Warship Photo Album," and in order to study the explosion of mines and shells and water columns, he repeatedly went to see the demonstration films of the US Navy. When he understood the essence of modern naval warfare, he had to study submarines and planes again.</p>
<p>Tatsuo continued to work hard without resting for a day. Two years passed like this. (101) Li Amao's Hygiene Mailbox</p>
