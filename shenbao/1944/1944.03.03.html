<h3>日軍移交廣州灣由我國接收管轄　中日當局已舉行簽字典禮</h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電日華南軍精銳部隊曾於去歲二月十六日為制　渝軍之愗動，曾以奇襲在雷州半島登陸，於同月廿一日和平進駐廣州灣　締結日越防衛協定，於越南當局之緊密協力之下，順利推行佔據地域內之軍政，一年來對治安之確立，民生之安定，均獲圓滿成果。華南軍當局頃鑒此實情，乃以三月一日為期撤廢該地域之軍政，將之劃入廣東省政府治下，正式作為和平地域。該日正午特於日軍司令部在廣州灣方面某部隊長與會下陳耀祖廣東省長與日軍司令官已正式簽字完畢，對此日華南軍報道都於三月一日正午發表如：次「日軍自於去歲二月廿一日進駐慶州灣以來，即於佔領地域內推行軍政，銳意進行確保治安及安定民生諸般工作，刻均已收獲圓滿實效，民衆亦得安居樂業，以是决自三月一日起撤廢廣州灣佔據地域之　政，移歸國府管轄，日軍今後專負作戰警備使命」。</p>
<p>日軍某部隊長談話</p>
<p>廣州二日中電廣州灣方面日軍某部隊長一日參加撤廢廣州　軍政之簽字典禮後，曾接見記者團。發表談話如次：一廣州憑之撤廢軍政歸屬國府，自實施軍政之初，即有此預定，故此次乃為當然之措置。刻該地實施軍政，已屆一年，治安民生，均趨良好，今日將之移交國府，實不勝欣快。文廣州灣之住民，均充分理解軍政協力日軍作戰，不遺餘力，實深感謝一。廣州灣，粵南當局，亦基於日越防衛協定，予以全面支持，及一年以來，雖屢遭敵方極力誹謗，然該地日越閭之關係，仍極　切。</p>
<p>政治經濟日趨繁榮</p>
<p>廣州二日中央社電，自日軍進駐廣州灣後，未幾當地民衆節陸績歸來，物資之交流，亦日　暢旺，刻大致均已恢復原狀，各方民衆，亦自動協力日軍，自去年五月至六月，各地即先後成立自治委員會至八月因各地自治組織與一般民衆之熱心協力，故治安愈形穩固，內地重要物資等之洗入，亦因而漸趨活潑，遂溪洋靑塗間之公共汽車路，得當地民衆協力。亦於最短期間內完成，更因整備自衛團警察等之組織，乃使敵之謀略，無從施展，此於治安維持上，頗多貢獻。於通貨政策，最初恐金融市塲混亂，故會使用舊幣，然自去年五月二十五日起即全面使用中儲券，因法國方面，對流通價值之協力，故自去年七月起。租借地內中儲券亦漸增加，迨至九月舊幣即完全停止琉通，又因自廣州運入之物資，極為順利，故一價即行下跌，於民生安定上，影響甚佳，因此廣州灣日趨繁榮，由於此次日本撤廢軍政，廣州灣即成為國府治下之新生地域，對於華南一元化之經濟軍事政治各方面，均有甚大影響。</p>
<h3>國府最高經濟顧問　小倉正恆繼任</h3>
<p>南奈二日中央社電　自國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太郎氏榮轉日藏相後，關於最高經濟顧問之　任人選，關係當局經愼重考慮與銓銜結果，已於二日正式聘請日前藏相貴族院議員小倉正恒氏繼任。按小倉氏曾於昭和十六年四月任日國務大臣，同年七月轉任藏相，現任東亞經濟懇談會會長戰時金融金庫總栽之要職。去年七月中曾以日民食經濟使節　團長之　　訪問我國。　受我國朝野之歡迎，相繼與我國當局及經濟界權威名洗舉行懇談交換意見，對於中日經濟合作　獻良多。並主張政治與經濟一體，安定民生須以公益為先，尤為我國朝野所欽佩，此次榮任我國最高經濟顧問，芷常國府本年經濟施策置重點於增產方面及努力推進各種重要經濟方策之際，故今後小倉氏之企劃協贊，必能使增產施策愈形强化與澈底，同時該氏隊自行充分發揮其手腕外，並將延攬多數增產部門之專門家，以强化經濟顧問部之陣容、因此今后國府增產工作等經濟施策之實施，乃將因小倉氏之繼任經濟顧問更可　滑推進，圓滿收獲，可以斷言。</p>
<p>小倉氏履歷</p>
<p>南京二日中央社國府最高經濟顧問小倉正恒之履歷如下：金澤縣人，現年七十歲，明治入年生，卅年東京帝大法科畢業，高等文官考試及格，歷任內務省土木監督署事務官兼內務省事務官，山口縣參事官，三十二年辭官入住友公司服務，三十三年留學歐美，三十五年歸國，任住友公司董事兼理事長，住友鑛業公司住友電錢襲造所，住友倉庫住友化鑛工業公司，住友機械製作等公司董事長，昭和八年任貴族院議員，十年任內閣審議會委員，十六年四月任國務大臣，七月任大藏大臣，十月退職，七年四月任戰時金融金庫總裁，十一月任東亞經濟　談會會長以迄於今。</p>
<p>周財長談話</p>
<p>南京二日中央社電小倉正恒氏，應聘國府最高經濟顧問，國府周財政部長佛海氏，特發表談話如下：「我國歷次騁任之最高經濟顧問靑木。石渡兩氏，對於我國財政施策及中日兩國之經濟提携，均有莫大之貢獻，吾人輙以為幸。自石渡氏榮轉盟邦大藏大臣，吾人更為興奮，其後任人選，現已徵得小倉正恒氏同意，繼任我國最高經濟顧問，於我國財政經濟前途，希望至大，綠小倉氏於近衛內閣時担任藏相，對我國已有特別認識，上次以赴華經濟視察團總團長姿格，來聘我國，發表種種談話，認識益見架切。當時對物資交　留制　通，尤復　　致意，眞識灼見，至堪欽偑。此次應聘來華。必能本其老財政家之經騐，與經濟上深切之學識，且　於靑木．石渡兩氏已往之　績，於我政府財政經濟之策劉建設，必能舒其　抱，作更進一步之貢獻。使我政府所寄典之　大顯望及全國人民所抱負之莫大期待，均得賴以完遂，吾人實不勝引為快慰也。</p>
<p>小倉氏談話</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電國府最高經濟顧問石渡莊太　氏就任職相後，茲决定由日戰時金融金庫總裁小倉正恒氏繼其後任，該氏二日並會見記者團發表談話，大意謂：此次國府聘請本人就任國府最高經濟顧問，余已全面接受國府之好意，而本人年巳高邁，白問菲才，今旣就任顧問職務，不僅須向國府轉達日木方面之意旨，同時更須以國府本身之立塲，誠意為新中國盡最大之努力，中日兩國有如　齒相關，必須共存共榮，斷不容相互關爭。余認中日事變之勃發，乃至擴大，全係由英美採分割支配政策所致。溯自國府參戰後，我國即採交還租界撒廣治外法權等措置，幷遂次實行對華新政策，使中國朝野多年祈望之平等互惠條　，安然成立，因此中國方面亦巳漸次理解日本之偵意，悉認日本若不勝利，中國即不能復興，故乃斷然參戰。今日亦復如此，自中國言。貢獻於大東亞戰分之方法，即為供給日本推行戰爭所必要之物資。去年本人曾赴中國考察一資源軍力之情形，參觀之饒，至感欣慰。余對關係者之努力，不禁頓生感謝之念，今後决盡最大努力，俾期收得更大成果。生活必須物資之增產。及食糧與採辦物資之增加，乃今日中國經濟最重要之問題，此與日本戰力之增强，自有連帶關係，同時對中國民生亦有重大影響。自維持通貨價値之點觀之，亦為一大問題，故甚望中日朝野各界隨時賜予指示，俾期充分認識事態，立於政治經濟財政等大局之综合見地，作適宜處理。中國經濟問題尤其複雜，多非以日本經濟單純之常識所能測知者。國家社會之成立，民衆思想與行動亦與日本逈異，余不願忽略此點，關於新政策之推進，須任中國政府當局及民間經濟人充分發揮其本來意志，以其資任感從事一切經濟建設，於實施新政策之過渡期間。最易發生錯誤，於此須捨棄小我，以就大同。余更擬儘已之所能，使兩國經濟人作精神上之融和。大東亞戰爭固為决定日木前途之戰爭，同時亦為决定中國將來之戰爭，木人决滅私奉公，致力於中國之經濟建設，尙乞中日兩國朝野，多予援助云。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>革新的勇氣</h3>
<p>當二月五日日本衆院會議全體通過必勝決議案後，東條首相起立致詞，說明政府「決不拘於過去所為，應採取者決予採取，應改革者決予改革，以期充分發揚戰時下國民之忠誠。」二月二十二日日木內閣改組後，舉行首次閣議，東條首相更披涩決心，說明政　府的決策，「過去我人所為或有不澈底之處，為爭取勝利，實應從新做起，竭盡全力，以底於成。」</p>
<p>東條首相話過去或有不能底之處，這是表示東　首相坦白的精神。東條首相說應改革者決予改革，應採取者決予採取，從新做起，以底於成，這是表示東條首相革新的勇氣。盟邦當局對於過去錯誤，坦白承認，對於今後革新，斷然實行，眞是有決心，有毅力，値得我們的欽佩。日本民族性以「積極果敢」著名，日木國民的積極果敢更是說到做到，「知行合一」。</p>
<p>戰爭是非常事件，大東亞戰爭更是劃時代的解放戰，我們的敵人更必用盡全力阻礙我們的解放。在這個大東亞圈裏的人們，一方面對外要努力進攻，一方面對內要努力生產，而負責的當局更為一切的中心，他的一言一行，在在足以影響整個國家，整個大東亞。我們看了近來日本政府所公佈的改革消息，知道日木無論對外的戰爭，對內的生產，一切均在革新之中。政府當局决不拘於過去所為，決不諱言錯誤，而為了遠到解放戰的目的，不惜採用新方法，從新做起。湯之盤銘曰：一苟日新，日日新，又日新。」這是敎人要、水恒的日新，而日木現在的措施，便是日新精神的表示。</p>
<p>廢除舊作風，應用新方法，已經是一件刻不容緩的工作，任何人都知道，可是並非任何人都能够做到。根本原因就在「革新勇氣」的有無。有勇氣的說到、做到，沒有勇氣的說到做不到，甚至不敢說。有勇氣革新的可以從舊環境裏創造出新生命，沒有男氣革新的只能隨着舊環境的消滅而結束他的舊生命。所謂優勝劣敗，適者生存，是人類進化的天則。這個天則在戰爭時期羅出他的重要性。勝敗是將來的結果，勝敗的原因，就在現在有沒有適應環境而革新的男氣。</p>
<p>戰爭時代，時間是最可實貴的，任何人都不應該讓他的時間閒過，當局的更不應該得過且過的蹉跎光陰。凡是應該改革的，就當有决心，有勇氣，立刻去做。假如在時間上落後一着，便使敵人在時間上佔先一着。大東亞圈裏的國家是一個連環，在道個連環裏，任何一個國家的落後要影響於整個的連環。我們希望凡是大東亞圈裏的人們都要把握時間，決意革新。</p>
<h3>國府軍事宣傳團　抵緬後聲明</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電緬甸前綫某基地電，國民政府為謀完遂大東亞戰爭起見，此次特派軍事宣傳團赴缅，於該方面與日軍緬甸政府自由印度臨時政府緊密協力，積極謀工作之推進。茲悉該團業巳抵達緬甸，開始活動，二日特發表聲明如次：友邦日木對英美發出宣戰布吿後，國府汪主席當即發表協大大東亞戰爭之重要聲明，同時為謀國力之充實，而積極從事建軍，今又專心努力增加生產，以與友邦共同分擔保衛東亞之重任，茲為更進一步，以積極擊滅英美，分擔里大之使命，而完遂大東亞戰爭起見，特派本團來緬與日軍緬甸政府及自由印度臨時政府等各當局緊密協力。此年我國最高國策，乃係本團來緬之最大使命。今後不畏任何犧牲，决謀密現大亞洲民族解放之宿望，同時為期早日實現復興中華，保衛東亞之祟高理念起見，决堅定與友邦日木同生共死之信念。以完遂大東亞戰爭，望各地僑胞，從速覺悟，對吾國今次之參戰工作，予以援助。幷促重慶之反省。使彼等徹底認淸英美侵略中國，侵略東亞之事實，遵行國父之大亞洲主義，與友吾日木共同建設大東要共存共榮之理想，于東亞民族團結一致之日號下，急速脫離英美之羅絆。</p>
<h3>防空的平時準備</h3>
<p>敵人終於在馬紹爾登陸了。北千島方面，敵機不時來襲，而一方面產人在大陸上的航空基地，正在積極擴充，虎視耽耽，企圖空襲本土，從四周的情勢看來，我們不能不嚴予警備。最近敵人的空襲盟邦德國，都在夜間，所以我們應有充分的覺悟與準備，以備夜間轟炸。與此同時，從日本地理的情形看來，或許會沒有警報而突然受到室襲，而且就使逐步的發出警戒警報，空襲警報，其時間亦非常短促，故全國的家庭不能不有萬全的準備。並且應特别注意下列二項：</p>
<p>待避所的整備</p>
<p>待避所是空襲下防衛國土的暫壕。我們一定要有足以安心寄託身體的所在。待　所有二種，一種是公共待避所，淺者應掘下至一米二〇，周圍的泥土應與四面一樣高，盛沙的沙袋與舖裝的石疊容易崩圮　塞，不可採用。另一種是家庭待避所，在南方各地建造家庭待漸所的結果，轟炸損失從二十分之一滅到三十分之一，所以家庭待　所的整備是很緊要的。掘在屋外的容易毀壞，應常加修理，屋內待　所的出口應安全妥當。</p>
<p>防火用水的整備</p>
<p>在室襲下，水是防火的彈丸。愈多愈好。受德國轟炸的俄國地方，每一百平方米突備水一百公升。日本多木造家屋，所以更不能不多備水量。平時就應該動員所有的資材建造貯水槽。備水的塲所也須妥為研究，設置於家屋前最便於消防的塲所，萬一燒夷彈落下時，不致有困難。使用貯水槽而能够消火的面積，大概是以續為中心的七米突範圍內。據歐洲的例看，最近的都市　炸，幾都在夜間，敵人的空製，或許也在夜間。我們受到沒有警報而突然前來的室襲，必須不慌張，立即從事防空活動，於是在平日屋內屋外就應聲頓一切防空用具，確保在防火活動上沒有障害的通路。（翔　飾譯二月二十一日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>仰光二日中央社電　緬甸境日軍談稱：緬甸一帶之敵軍，於去秋雨季期過後，即發動反攻，先在雲南，繼而在夫公地區開始活動，木年以來，更向日軍方面輒作挑戰行動，均為日軍擊退。敵方重開緬甸援蔣路綫，得奪回緬甸之企圖，因此己吿瓦解，並充分暴露其缺乏統制之弱點。茲日軍緬甸派遣軍，已與緬甸防衛軍及印度國民軍間，着着强化，促進同盟軍之連繫，當此風雲緊急之際，决定採取一更飛躍之手段，决定由緬甸防衛軍及印度國民軍最高司令部派遺幕僚赴緬甸方面，日軍陸軍最高司令部，俾作緊密之連繫，以期完成共同防　及　行共同作戰之任務。今緬每防衛軍及印度國民軍。均日見整備，向為獨立之軍隊，具備其壯嚴之陣容，此次當置機關之設置，實使互相間之連繫更趨緊密化，吾人為應付緊迫之現行戰局，完遂戰爭目的今後將有驚人之活動。</p>

<h3>紀念「三三」友朋節</h3>
<p>— 楊郁生</p>
<p>三月三日為上已節，又為國際友朋節，今年為中華民國成立三十三年，又欣逢今日為國際友朋節第十週紀念，時代賜我苦痛，友朋却賜我安慰。中國俗諺云：生我者父母，愛我者朋友，我們對此三三令節，自應以紀念父母之心來組念知心好友！</p>
<p>朋友原為五倫之一，交友為人生最受益最享樂之事，論語云：「益者三友」：又云：「益者三樂」，樂多腎友，樂育天下之英才，其快樂最偉。交友亦為人生最艱難之事，「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，相處稍久，習染漸深，關係各人之品性及事業，影響甚深；好的朋友可以使你前進向上，而壞的朋友，可以使你退步墮落，古今來多少可歌可泣可恨可憐之事跡，與交友之賢否有密切之關鍵，可不愼乎？</p>
<p>中國人交友，向重信義，傳說三國時劉號張桃園結義，迄今猶為普通社會所景仰，凡合夥經商或結拜兄弟。崇拜關公像，以表示信義之重要，所謂義氣朋友，常保有互助之精神。</p>
<p>交友應抱平等觀念，不可因階級或年齡相差，還抱相互歧視的態度，一方應敬老，一方應慈幼，上不驕；下不謟，少年人能從老友處認識實貴的經騐，善意的敎訓，而老輩亦可由少年羣中學習勇猛精進之精神，老當益壯，快樂無窮。</p>

<h3>日潛水艦印度洋長征記</h3>
<p>我做了某潛水艦的乘員，超過怒濤咆哮，廣袤凡一萬海里的印度洋，在西被阿拉伯，東受印度圍繞的阿拉伯海之狂濤駭浪中，繼績長時間的潛航生活。這級最新銳潛水艦初次出障，已把敵船接連地擊沉，使我們的耳朶裏聰到魚雷打中敵船的快樂聲音，眼中看到敵船臨到末路的　愴光景。在阿拉伯海上，已印上我們壯烈的潛水艦精神了。現在把我們濟水艦在印度洋破壞交通戰事情形。寫在下面：</p>
<p>準備出港</p>
<p>「準備出港」，這樣一艦長的命令一下，喇叭便奏起嘹亮的聲音，接着拔錨機械開始發動了。艦上和陸上互相致了嚴肅的敬禮，互相搖着帽子作別。一基地的建築物，在黃昏的風景中，如夢似的消逝了。於是一經過了水道，印度洋的猛浪，把我們的身體搖韌，使我們沒有一刻可以梢憇。</p>
<p>是在第幾天的薄暮，由先鋒的僚艦送來一個信號說：「某時由先鋒艦開始潛航，一方面仍保守元來的速度。」於是艦的影踪沈沒到水平綫下去，遣時司令又來一個信號說：「應運照預定行動，並祝成功與武運長久。」就此潛水艦互相比賽擊沈敵輪，望西方進去。我們的目標在阿非利加與阿拉伯的沿岸，從事破壞敵軍的交通路綫。印度洋是我們的海呀！用過早餐，想登艦橋，未到發令處的時候，由艦橋傳來一個報吿說：「左邊三十度有商輪二艘，向右而進。」艦長立刻登上艦橋，是何等的幸運呵，發動進攻後，不過二十天，便發見了獵物。等待我上去的時候，我艦已與敵艦並行，進入逍擊了。「是一艘敵國的油船。」艦長從容地說，一方面抽着香烟。因為是一艘巨大的船，前後的船橋距離廣闊，所以誤為兩艘。商船的速度差不多有〇〇度，據艦長說，一年以前，曾經在這附近海上，截捕荷蘭的商輪。</p>
<p>一艘巨大油船</p>
<p>我們的艦很順利地進口攻，全艦將十都在興奮中要撲到這頭陣的敵船上去。接近一看是塗抹淡黃色的鉅大油船，它不知道遭受襲擊，只管行駛着。至〇時的時候我艦趕過敵船，正是很好的時間，便緩慢速度，奉命準備潛航。我艦與敵船的距離若干，潛航下去，立刻準備聽音，航海長說：「〇時實施襲擊」時間一到，艦長發出命令了。不一會開始魚雷戰事，我艦巳經整備回頭襲擊的熊勢，深約有若干，我覺得在異常興奮的環境裏。潛水艦不容易浮上去，艦長再怒喊說：「立刻要射出，把艦淺俘吧。一好像有不能放心的預感。與敵船的距離迫近幾米夾了，一秒二秒……精神緊張了，但所期待的打中敵船的聲音，終於不能聽到。艦長的臉上浮現汗珠，艦長呌我看看潛望鏡，果然在波浪打圈的中間，敵船的巨體依然浮現着。「重新發動攻擊吧！」艦長再說一句，便到發令處去。午餐的時間早已過了，在用飯時的艦長的心裏是多麼難過呵。</p>
<p>因為要保持適常的距，在某一天浮上海面，再進入高速度的追擊。〇時半，在前方的水平錢上。又發見敵船的船檣，洛着夕陽行走着。從此非趕過敵船，採取襲擊的陣勢不可。我艦於是向右行走。不一會十二的月光，發出光亮，但是海上蒙蔽着靄霧，阻碍嘉視界。因此遂看不見水平綫上的敵船了。航海長說敵船在橫面，然而不見敵船的踪影，我艦雖然再進，也不能够發見逃入黑暗中的敵船。〇時〇分，警視員忽然呌道：「艦首〇千有敵船、一接着這個報吿的艦長，正在吃着飯後的靑果，我看他那從容的風度，心裏相信今天的晚上，一定收到職果。</p>
<p>自此艦長便登上艦橋，不再下來了。</p>
<p>連中敵船</p>
<p>月光遍照我艦，漸次趕過數船了。某時成功頸足進出的我艦，因要再度買行襲擊潛航下去。司令塔全部熄滅了燈火。巳呈黑暗世界。深度有〇〇。艦長的兩眼凝視着商輪。「戰鬥」，「準備魚雷戰」。這樣接速準備雷擊。於是發出攻射的命令了。在這發動攻擊的瞬問，艦長正在無我的心境中。魚雷直射出，金屬性的聲音還未去，炸裂的聲音已經傳來了，「打中」的呌聲，不約而同地由司令塔與發令處發出，於是歡喜充滿了全艦，中了魚雷的敵船，發出呼救的信號，它自信有二萬五千噸之大。禾易沈沒，發信達三十分之久，但最後逐罰出，一放棄我船」，於是電波斷了。在喝着汽水的艦長，仍未離開潛望鏡，「可惡的東西，再來一趨。」艦長再决意攻擊。我艦打一個回轉，這次將由敵船的左舷攻擊。因為停止通管，艦內的氣壓上昇，連呼吸也盛得困難，而艦靜靜地廻轉寇頭。於是最後的一擊放出了。一聲命中的聲音，接着三次很大的炸裂聲音，魚雷把大砲全部打碎，敵船變成沒有尾巴的東西，但是還沒有沉下去。某時，我艦浮上，這次艦長决意加以砲擊。因為預料敵方的反攻，先進備機槍戰然後漸漸地接近去，用機槍打着這敵船，但也沒有反應，敵人似乎逃了。我艦的砲員下了甲板，要實旅「左砲戰」了，波浪猛烈，我艦尤如二葉的小舟，異常搖動，砲員浴着波浪奮戰。開始隆薩的砲擊。敵船的船橋與後部，中了炸彈，於是後都着了火，船橋也發火了。這時候月兕巳沉，在昏黑的海面，火光熊熊，那鉅大的數船，也深深地葬入印度洋的海中了。我艦初次奏着凱歌，在天還未亮的海上，為找尋第二次的獵物，繼續征途去了。</p>
<p>飛魚的味道</p>
<p>每天有飛魚跳到甲板上來，祝福着我們的前途，我們依次嘗試這飛魚的味道，能够吃了印度洋的魚，也是我們報道班員的特惠呀。我潛水艦越過怒濤，再向印度洋西力進去。</p>
<p>自出發后幾天以來，桌上排着罐頭食品，帶來的生食糧品，也將吿罄。晚飯後艦長，機關長，先任將校，聚集在士官室，協議着作戰方法。潛永艦已接近敵地，覺得要睡，就在波浪中閉了兩眼，這和奶兒沒有兩樣，我們是有名譽的海軍軍人呵，某月以來，我們為什麽訓練，為什麼到印度洋來呢？老將軍說：「養兵千日，用在一朝。希望大家緊張，要緊在先發見敵人，如果被敵人先發見，那末要葬喪海中，應决然奮起。」這是進入敵機活動圈內時的檄文。風雨愈形猛列。趟在床上，時時乒乓的聲音從舷側傳來，好像中了子彈一般，覺得不怏。印度洋的緊張情緒，居然圍繞着全艦了。</p>
<p>生活反常</p>
<p>開始長時間的　航以後，日常生活從而變更，迎吃飯的時間也不能按定時刻，喫了一頓，說不定人長時間的潛航後，居然發見意外的事實〇號的總水管桶發生毛病，因為連日遭到猛浪，已受了致命傷，艦已監危險的狀態。照這現狀，假使碰着炸雷，潛入〇米突，也要沉下去。現在如果被敵方發見，自滅是無疑的。於是在敵前〇海里，繼續决死的作業，一方面舖張布席，一方面在艦內，機關部員拚命的修理，幾點鐘以後，我艦恢復常態，即在阿拉伯沿岸靜靜地繼續索敵行動。誰都沒有頸料到，在拼命的修理作業翌日會收到偉大的戰績。那是發見着被騙逐艦保護着的輸運船團，今天的功勞者是航海長，朝餐後他當値的時候，不料發見在波浪隱約中有一批船團，先發見兩艘商輪，立即報吿艦長，於是艦內各就戰鬥的位置，臥在床上的我，聽着下面堂水雷長喊道：「是商輪呀」！連忙起來，一瞬間艦內變成戰塲，迨至我上司令塔來的時候，已確認是一批的敵船團。艦長下令某時某分發射一顆必中的魚雷，打出後到司令塔報吿敵情說：『還有很多的油船呀』！接着有隆隆的炸聲響來，那是打中二萬五千噸的油船，艦長的臉上浮現着微笑。於是再下令準備第二次的魚雷攻擊，正要射出魚雷的時候，發見了近在咫尺的敵驅潛艦，因為這是初次的發見，艦長出斷念第二次的攻擊，命令潛航下去，幾分鐘之後，達到〇米突的深度，每一個防水屋都關起來，電扇機也停了，連電動機的聲音都聰不到，我艦正用最小速度。使騙潛艦聰不到行踪。那在敵前條理的作業，現在果然發生效果了。我艦潛入這麼深度，亦沒有絲臺的不安，可謂由死裏救了全班的船員。不一會接連有三個炸聲，又再來一次，把我們的神經都打動了。騙潛艦接近了停了下來在聰音。艦內連孩嗽聲也沒有，在沉靜中時而聽到排水的音響。〇分很大的炸雷聲振動着船舷，敵艦因為繼續投下炸雷，我們已如風前之燭了。不過對於我艦的無聲潛航，敵艦仍不知道位置，在亂放炸雷彈，我正在最可怕的炸雷中，覺得似乎在看着將要坍壞的屋子一般。但長死的恐怖，却全然沒有，只有信賴着我艦。過了一下，敵艦已經離開得遠了。這次與驅潛艦的鬥爭，果然得到勝利，潛航之後再把潛望鏡檯上去，將要沈下去的油船，騙潛艦正從事加以拯救遭難的船員，騙潛艦只是在其周圍打圈，保護着那艘油船的最後光景。經過長久的潛航，大陽已沈沒在水平綫下，海上浮出殘月淡照黃，我艦再搜索敵船向前駛進。</p>
<p>留下偉大戰績</p>
<p>有一天晚上，正在士官室看書的時候，軍醫長飛也似的來說：『看見商輪了。』連忙登上艦橋一看，水平綫上浮現着一塊巨大黑物。我艦立即以船高速度計畫趕上敵船，但敵船在漾朧中消失，以後便看不見了，這次失去一個好的機會。</p>
<p>再於某日，被鈴聲驚醒，我艦和騙潛艦的距雖只有〇米夾，夾然在瓦斯中現出，騙潛艦的前面有商輪一艘，騙潛艦將要向我艦發砲了。我艦向右邊駛去，雖然敵艦沒有察覺，但這邊際了斷念襲擊以外，也別無方法，我們暫時抱持勇氣，繼續忍耐找尋敵船，至沒有油沒有糧食為止，我們將在阿拉伯沿岸，留下偉大的戰續，（弘譯自一月二十八，二十九日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>念阿弟</h3>
<p>— 唐敏</p>
<p>—追憶棲宿時，聲容滿心耳。</p>
<p>我記得一個詩人這麼說過：「一個人用回憶來生活，顯見得這人的生活也只剩下些殘餘的渣滓了。」這句話使我打着寒噤，我知道自己還是很年靑，不該用回憶來折磨我，來蠶食我靑春的活方；但是什麼東西能娜使我奮發呢，我太息着。如果應該哭的時候强作笑，不是成了瘋子了麼？</p>
<p>天右落着雨，我把自己關在屋子裏，岑寂和憂傷使我想起過去的哀樂，一個影子便撞到我的心上來了。他有着圓團團的險，鼻樑上掛着一副黑邊眼鏡，他未曾開口總是先露出笑容，令人感到說不出的親切。也許是他比我年靑一些的緣故吧，我是喊他「阿弟」的；事實上，他是一個大哥哥，他有着一羣失去了父母的弟弟妹妹。</p>
<p>他們是沒有家的，他和他的弟妹們都寄寓在一家他的姑母當校長的學校裏。在這年頭，生活指數是一天一天高漲，他憑着父親遺下來的幾個數目並不頂大的存摺來維持他自己和弟妹們的敎育費和生活費。是多麼不容易的事情呵！讓我姑且用「身心焦瘁」四個字加到池的身上吧！池終於在一個夏天裹病到了。</p>
<p>我得到逍個不幸的消息，便去看池。我把一束花插在他用糖瓶作成的花瓶裏，輕聲地喊着他。他懶懶地動了動眼皮，對我笑了笑。</p>
<p>「你覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>「不過是吐了幾口血，」他的臉上露出慘淡的笑容，「眞討厭，偏偏在大考的時候！」</p>
<p>他沉重地嘆了口氣，他說他遲畢業半年，無　多掠奪弟妹們一份生活費用，無異仙自己少活半年。時光對他是多麽貫貴啊！</p>
<p>他的話我是能够了解的。我恐怕他設話太興奮，對於他病體是不宜的，於是我講了一個笑話，停止了池的牢騷。但是我自已的眼睛却無緣無故潤濕起來了。</p>
<p>是為了種種方便吧，他到一個醫院裏去靜養了　個月。我有一次約着一個朋友去看他，他含着笑容歡迎我們，陪着我們在草地上散步。他平靜地吿訴我們，前幾天在他的病室裏死去一個人，他的心情是這樣——</p>
<p>「……我見到看護婦雙手握着臉，尖說地呌起來，便拼命往被筒裏縮，我心裏想着我不能死，不能死，我有這麼一羣弟妹！」</p>
<p>以後，他是漸漸地好起來了，朋友們都替他高興。我們許許多多人常常到他那裏去閒談，他的屋子裏不啻是友人們約會的集合地。我們會在他那裏，嚼着花生米，消磨整個下午。說着連自已都不很明白的，火熾的　。</p>
<p>他躭憂着他弟妹們的幸福，他說他連塲病化去了不少錢，將來的日子怎麼過：</p>
<p>「我要補償他們的，敏！」</p>
<p>他這麽堅决地說着。</p>
<p>接養半年，他似乎有些變了，他不再跟找談起他的弟妹了。「……我應該想得更深更廣些，弟妹們的生存與這更深更廣的問題是有連繫的。」他這種話使我感到詫異，我暗暗吃驚自己長衰老了。</p>
<p>也是這樣整個年頭將在風雨裏消失，將近廢曆除夕的一天。一個友人氣喘喘到我這裏來，好生費力，才說出阿弟是失蹤了</p>
<p>「……他信裏說：他不能够再掠奪弟妹們的生活資用了……為了他們的生存，他不能不離開這裏！」</p>
<p>——他到什麼地方去了呢？</p>
<p>從這一天起，我思索着這個問題。</p>
<p>我記得，好幾年是這樣的：在廢曆元旦我總是約着他到一個敎過我們書的同學的父親那裏去拜年。前二個年頭，我在別處洗浪，我沒有想起這件事。今年我在家過年，想鉑我不能再約他同去，心中禁不住充滿了他鬱。</p>
<p>仰起頭，望望天：但願故人。到處安吉！（忘憂草之二）</p>
<h3>孤雁</h3>
<p>— 華生</p>
<p>朋友們：</p>
<p>亦許您們到這信時會感到相富的驚異吧！在長久音訊杳然後的今天，我會從遼遠的北國南下而流浪到這兒來。在您們亦許以為我已不再在這世界裏——像一個晨星那末無人知曉地殞落了。的確，我是像量星一般地微弱，可是我並沒有殞落！</p>
<p>生帶來了幸福，亦帶來了厄運，可是在我道短短的人生中，您知道我的靈魂是被厄運怎樣地在鞭笞着？宰割着？我亦曾屢次想用死來抵抗這種厄運，但都給生之慾火拉回來了，我還是繼續地忍受鞭笞宰割，和我的厄遝去鬥爭。您以會這是我怕死？懦怯？——不，我需要有生命的生活，繼續跟生活掙扎才是眞正的勇氣！</p>
<p>當然，一個有着豐滿的生活的人是不會想到這些的，可是朋友們，請您們試把生活的着色限鏡去掉，您們就會認淸什麽是人生了，</p>
<p>天邊雁羣鳴聲嘹亮，振着豐滿的毛羽到處飛翔，在它們這整齊的行列中無論那一個决不會想到那脫羣南飛的一個同伴，雖然它們高飛入雲霄，可是它們被翳　所迷蔽，失去了它們的方向。朋友們為着您們的生命，去鬥爭掙扎，去征服生命！別讓現實生活迷蔽了您們人生的方向！</p>

<h3>春燕</h3>
<p>— 金石</p>
<p>「春」給人們帶來的是甦程蓬勃。</p>
<p>田野裏盛開了的菜花，在緣油油的一片上，淡抹了一層金黃。柳堤倒影，隔岸桃紅，在施旎的風光中，飄來糽翎變燕，掠過水面，掀起了美麗的漣漪。跟着燕子的蒞臨，大地暖和了。</p>
<p>那祇有薄弱勇影的變尾，披護這短小身體的燕，却正是駭浪中的勇士，春的先　。</p>
<p>燕，像飄落的葉，洗蕩的萍，沒有園定的歸宿。把生命寄託在遼園的長空，像雲朶般的　髯，翩翔在白浪的海面，像仙子般的自在，碧海晴空，都是它長征的旅途。它追踪　　，掙扎着生命的溫暖。</p>
<p>春又降臨到江南了，那追踪溫暖的勇士，便排成整齊的隊伍，從遼遠的犬際，無邊的海角，浩燙臨空，鼓　　巧的翼子，遄飛山川，橫渡重霧；掠避了洶湧的駭浪，完成它們艱辛偉大的旅程。在這樣長的旅途中，它們並未因疲倦而折回，盡了最大的毅力，終於越過萬里關山，來到　江南，呼吸着春的氣息，飄顧在春的世界裏。</p>
<p>春又是多麽富於詩意呀！靑山碧水。祿柳經時，對這都是一種安慰與鼓舞流浪者的心，飛舞在這快樂的天地中，無憂，無愁，是何等怡然自在呀！不問是雕樑畫棟，或是殘瓦茅橡，都會興奮地啣泥載草，築起它的新窩。所謂「王謝堂前」，抑是「尋常人家」。在它們都是不分軒輊。遇居則安，絲毫沒有顚沛洗離的苦痛，在小巢中喃喃欣忭，這正是生活的趣味哩！</p>
<p>直到春離開江南，秋風奏起哀歌，他們才重新振翼高飛，繼續去追踪一春一的踪跡，因此他們的環境是永遠那末新鮮，美麗；他們的生命，永遠是年靑，自由。</p>
<p>但是，我被困在這苦悶的窒息重圍裏，度着死木般的生活，把固有的心靈，陷於欲凍的地窖裏，正缺少了燕子般的自由。雖然我具有莫大的毅力，勇氣，可是沒有勁强的翅膀，劃破重重烏雲，衝到自由的天空。</p>
<p>我愛我的家，也愛我的鄕土。可是為了要從泥濘的深淵裏，拯救自己，使生活過得像一條繳洗。不得不把一前程」寄託在遠長的征程上，去力求偉大的自由。不必定是拍拉圖的理想國，陶淵明的桃花源，只要是新鮮的環境，自由的天地。</p>
<p>朋友，願如燕子般的永遠為着追求春的溫暖而跋踄吧！</p>

<h3>再戰一警之前　為東華論攻守方法　注意一警特長——設施對策</h3>
<p>本星期日東華對一警的一塲足球賽，為足聯會第二循環之一幕。猶憶第一循環中東華僅以三對二險勝一警，故本　之戰，樂為趕早作此研討攻守之道。</p>
<p>先看一警，以何勝人？攻方面唯靠小黃毛之竄，第一循環中老　亦步亦趨，但眼睛一靈，老哺鶏變鴨，仍為其獨得二球，此人誠唯一危臉人牧。非但竄　快，傳遞亦準，射門又巧，守方面則均以長力勝人，全賽够得上、尤以祠萊脫，老奸巨滑，門檻全精。其戰術用長傳遞，極解小派　。以上為一警之特點。明乎此，東華應如何注意攻守之通。略抒鄙見，以為智者之輔。　　談進攻</p>
<p>對方守門浮尼克善設空門，故射門者不必過於用力，傳免失的，應以乖巧為主，具守之主腦柯萊脫大概是注意孫錦順，這價是　會。老孫地多用引誘其搶球，在適富時期傳空擋。李垚幃龍海竭力多跑，可多得空擋，乃能立見功效。而韓龍海應該注意越位，否則為　九似，功虧簧，是最可惜的。致於有翼賈幼良雖有郁　華肯眼着奔，但以買資格老練，故應仍以高遠皮盤旋為本。惟切中之球，在勾時應該仔細傳到人稀少的落點，好在其餘四人，均有獲球之能力。阿戴大致由鐵伏尼來看守，此點可吿無慮。阿戴雖老，遛人風度猶存，鐵必有所失，阿戴　可從中接濟。但希望多供給韓龍海竄進之機會，（李垚亦可竄）則自多功成。</p>
<p>論守衛</p>
<p>一般以為小黃毛祇有讓譯福楨來死釘（第一循環亦如此）此固不得已之策：鄙見則以為中堅必須有助攻之勢，否則前後一斷，攻勢必將因以減色。故譚不應注全力於看守。而看守小黃毛之職，應由張林根負大部份責任，蓋張身胚好。如遇小黃七得球時，應可由平跑中撞之，（足球中有可以撞人的規定，但須不犯規。（小黃毛有張一撞，必難直進，（屢見如此）則小黃毛之路一斷，前鋒必不能呼應自如。麥其當之脚頭，何足懼哉？譚可多多作助攻，不可預疑多盤。更有進者，李寗莊友仁之地位，應立得特別適當，蓋如立得則，果可使對方易入越位，然反之，即趕不上而有危險。如過後則引狼易入室，亦有相當危險，故二人須考究地位，庶幾能收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>總之，東華一警兩隊，近來都是越踢越好，兩隊均有神竄之將東華韓龍一海一警小黃毛，雨面對竄一，其鏡頭之精彩，我人可以想像及之。又據一警方面傳出消息，上戰以一球慘敗，今戰養精蓄銳，志在報一箭之仇。而東華則錦標在握，常勝榮譽，豈肯失之交臂，行見咸陽路上。木週勢將鬨動一時，逸國場上，定必人山人海。願我健兒，發揮威力，則不負萬千球迷擁護之熱，此記者之所以寫本篇研討焉。（潔）</p>
<h3>全滬公開籃球賽　談參加甲組隊實力</h3>
<p>西靑籃球甫吿結束，全滬公開籃球賽接踵舉行，可見滬土對於籃球運動，最為着遍。觀木　公開賽之甲組各隊，大半為西靑各隊之原班。唯有東方業餘三輪三隊，無形解散外，而另外多中北東華友隊明星等隊，茲略述甲組新興數隊之實力：</p>
<p>中北</p>
<p>原為滬上動旅之一，亦為北派宗匠。前番加入西靑之時，才有奪取錦標之雄心，旋以主將李震中足傷，影嚮實力，乃吿退出。此次李傷勢已愈，恢復雄風，餘如國手沈聿恭徐兆熊輩，聲勢殊壯。北派戰術，固未必適應目下情形，唯以其個人技術之見稱，以及豐富之經騐，故仍為極有希望壓倒羣雄之可能。</p>
<p>友隊</p>
<p>為前叙芳隊之變相，隊員如董小培陶紹生鄒自仁何孝光樊慶咸宋啓後李　德，久隸一隊，聯絡素佳。更有恃點者，該隊釘人功大，較勝他隊，故該隊若過對方越强者則愈有勁。故日後必為尃造冷門戰績之一隊，其能予强隊以戚脅，而未必能輕取庸弱之隊，蓋全隊缺管射籃之將。</p>
<p>東華</p>
<p>東華體育會旗帳之下，按其足球戰績，甚見彪一炳，籃球塲上，尙少見其合作。論其個人成績，則韓龍海賈幼良張邦綸輩，亦屬比中健將，唯鐔福楨張林根等無從推測其實力。究之，全隊氣力充足，戰術恐鮮美妙，其戰績難望如何卯上，中平之資格而巳。</p>
<p>明星</p>
<p>係中西大藥房職員所組織，隊部史久全沈達等原參與華南隊作戰，此番另樹新轍，並邀得宿將陳學崇王鏡瑚等加人。談人材一，不可謂非無希望。</p>
<p>晨友</p>
<p>本屬乙組之洗，加入中潘健華從中指揮，該鰍力爭向上，其奮勇之作戰，必有可觀。</p>
<p>合衆</p>
<p>前中一隊之原班人馬，昔日亦曾有前進之好評。此番東山再起，我人極願其不失所望。然筆者曾目諸其最近演出，則今非昔比，一落千丈，人未老而球藝已衰。如不力圖綀習，恐不免落在人後。</p>
<p>聯華　　則華聯之乙組，在西靑加入乙組，在中靑則加入甲組，自有其作用在焉。蓋隊員如徐菊不生嚴又陵瞿嚴龍輩，時在健身房練習，塲地熟練，當能佔得不少便宜，或可望有相當成績。</p>
<p>神馬</p>
<p>亦為西靑乙組中之「屈洛人」隊益以巨人之沙司金，全隊賴身體魁悟為唯一特點。而其技術尙見幼稚，匹夫之勇，將徒見其空用一番　勁而巳。</p>
<p>餘如仁餘隊有張少卿之加入，大華隊有陸鐘恩許女奎之參戰，華　隊之有包松圓助陣，均增厚實力，固亦不難洞見各隊之用心。唯同仁隊則以張邦綸之效勞東華，將成為淸一色之宜家班，實力未免滅遜，戰績亦將因之遜色矣。（瘦記者）</p>
<h3>介紹兩個新興女籃球隊　「大華」「康愛」小姐們個個是健將</h3>
<p>本週末，木市公開籃球聯賽，在中靑開幕。女子組中，首賽大華對康愛。</p>
<p>大華</p>
<p>大華集約大女生及中西聖馬利亞兩校之精說，實力當然雄厚。前鋒有隊長英美娟及妹美玉二人，均壘球名手。羽毛球健將沈淑，現服務於某圖書公司，乃運動全才。劉兆蘭乃華南名將，劉福基之妹，乃兄門檻，全部學會。王鳳貞現任中西體育敎練，技術當然不凡。又有伶俐活潑小妹妹鄧琪瑤。全隊攻努兇猛。後衛則有健美小姐楊靜及妹紉芬。楊氏兄弟姐妹，熱心體育，為大華男女球隊之負責人。程慕蘭是本市壘球名投手。沈郇靈為醫科學生，功課繁車，能抽空打球，難能可貴。薛氏姐妹德音微音，身材高大，為籃燈體育會之健將，全隊人才濟濟，本屆錦標有染指希望。</p>
<p>康愛</p>
<p>康愛女子籃球隊，去年底新組成軍，隊員大半是約大女學生。隊長王臆德，身材高大，傳球投籃，强悍與男子無異。與錢榮煥小姐同為前北平美童之運動健將，亦與影星王淵同學。李秀貞乃本埠綱球名手李國璠之妹，家學源淵，球藝當然可觀。曾包辦本埠游泳冠軍之三位美人魚沈郇明程錦俏劉天春，均是該鰍基本隊員，雙辮將則有陳素琴小姐及葉金榮小姐。小妹妹吳緻文及馬兗生，為前工女中之運動健將，與綠隊黃明媛同為女體育家陳詠聲先生之得意弟子。王家姊妹淡雲淡月，打起球來，輕描淡寫，如問天上的雲月一樣。挑球名將王壽珍小姐，習籃球日子很短，技術己能登堂人室。可惜於練球時，總歡喜與男友出去看話劇。此外還有了如玉小姐，已如花似玉。南國的好克力姑娘，外號裘蒂加蘭，是日雖不出塲，亦到塲助威。全隊盡為良材，可惜練習的時間太少。此次參加聯賽，旨在切磋球藝，勝負所不計也。</p>
<p>大華與康愛，乃姊妹隊，大家都同學。料不到初賽　碰頭。同室操戈，局面當然緊張。精彩表演，當可預卜、最末了消息，大華是日全體　簇新緞子行頭出塲，滬上球迷眼福不淺。（梅科）</p>

<p>此次公開籃球賽，當局對於甲組乙組女子各組秩序之編排，在時間方面，各界均表示未臻盡善，亡羊補牢，尙未為晚，希望改進之！</p>
<p>中靑比賽用國際規則，與西靑規則頗多不同之點，球員可以參考前本刋所載劉荷生之「兩種規則不同」一文。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Hand Over Guangzhou Bay to Chinese Jurisdiction; Signing Ceremony Held Between Chinese and Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The elite troops of the Japanese South China Army, in order to counter the movements of the Chongqing forces, landed on the Leizhou Peninsula in a surprise attack on February 16th of last year. On the 21st of the same month, they peacefully entered Guangzhou Bay. Through close cooperation with the Vietnamese authorities under the Japan-Vietnam Defense Agreement, they smoothly carried out military and administrative affairs in the occupied area. Over the past year, they have achieved satisfactory results in establishing public order and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Considering this reality, the South China Army authorities have decided to abolish military and administrative affairs in the area from March 1st and place it under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, formally designating it as a peaceful area. At noon on that day, a signing ceremony was held at the Japanese military headquarters, attended by a certain commander of the Japanese army in the Guangzhou Bay area, Chen Yaozu, the Governor of Guangdong Province, and the Japanese Commander. The South China Army reported on this event, published at noon on March 1st as follows: "Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay on February 21st of last year, it has been implementing military and administrative affairs in the occupied area, focusing on ensuring public order and stabilizing the people's livelihood. Now, satisfactory results have been achieved, and the people are living in peace and contentment. Therefore, it has been decided to abolish the military and administrative affairs in the Guangzhou Bay occupied area from March 1st and transfer it to the jurisdiction of the National Government. The Japanese army will henceforth be solely responsible for combat and security missions."</p>
<p>Talk by a Certain Commander of the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News) – After participating in the signing ceremony for the abolition of military and administrative affairs in Guangzhou Bay on the 1st, a certain commander of the Japanese army in the Guangzhou Bay area met with a group of reporters. He made the following remarks: "The abolition of military and administrative affairs in Guangzhou Bay and its return to the National Government was planned from the beginning of the implementation of military and administrative affairs, so this is a natural measure. It has been a year since the implementation of military and administrative affairs in the area, and public order and people's livelihood have generally improved. We are very pleased to hand it over to the National Government today. The residents of Guangzhou Bay fully understand the military administration and have cooperated with the Japanese army in its operations without reservation, for which we are deeply grateful. The Guangdong and South China authorities have also provided full support based on the Japan-Vietnam Defense Agreement, and despite repeated slanders from the enemy over the past year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam in the area remains extremely close."</p>
<p>Political Economy Heading Towards Prosperity</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay, the local people have gradually returned, and the exchange of goods has become increasingly prosperous. Most things have now returned to their original state, and people from all walks of life are automatically cooperating with the Japanese army. From May to June of last year, autonomous committees were established one after another in various places. By August, thanks to the enthusiastic cooperation of local autonomous organizations and the general public, public order became more stable, and the influx of important materials from the interior gradually became more active. The bus route between Suixi and Yangqingtu was completed in the shortest possible time with the cooperation of the local people. Furthermore, the organization of self-defense groups and police forces made it impossible for the enemy's schemes to be carried out, which contributed greatly to the maintenance of public order. Regarding currency policy, the old currency was used at first for fear of chaos in the financial market. However, from May 25th of last year, the Central Reserve Bank notes were used comprehensively. Thanks to the cooperation of the French side in the value of circulation, the Central Reserve Bank notes gradually increased in the leased territory from July of last year. By September, the old currency had been completely discontinued. In addition, the import of goods from Guangzhou was very smooth, so prices immediately fell, which had a very good impact on the stability of people's livelihood. As a result, Guangzhou Bay is becoming increasingly prosperous. Due to the Japanese abolition of military administration this time, Guangzhou Bay has become a new area under the rule of the National Government, which has a great impact on the unification of South China in terms of economy, military, and politics.</p>
<h3>Mr. Ogura Masatsune Succeeds as Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, was honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in Japan, the relevant authorities have carefully considered and examined candidates for the position of Supreme Economic Advisor. On the 2nd, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the former Minister of Finance and member of the House of Peers, was formally appointed to succeed him. Mr. Ogura previously served as Minister of State in Japan in April of Showa 16 (1941) and transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in July of the same year. He currently holds important positions such as the Chairman of the East Asia Economic Roundtable and the President of the Wartime Financial Bank. In July of last year, he visited our country as the head of the Japanese People's Food and Economic Mission and was welcomed by both the government and the public. He successively held talks and exchanged opinions with authorities and economic figures of our country, contributing greatly to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. He also advocated the integration of politics and economics, and that stabilizing people's livelihood should take public welfare as the priority, which was especially admired by the government and the public. This time, his honorable appointment as the Supreme Economic Advisor to our country coincides with the National Government's emphasis on increasing production in its economic policies this year and its efforts to promote various important economic strategies. Therefore, Mr. Ogura's planning and support will surely strengthen and thoroughly implement the production increase policies. At the same time, he will fully demonstrate his skills and recruit experts in various production departments to strengthen the economic advisory department. Therefore, the implementation of economic policies such as the National Government's production increase work will be promoted more smoothly and achieve satisfactory results due to Mr. Ogura's succession as Economic Advisor. This can be stated with certainty.</p>
<p>Mr. Ogura's Biography</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The biography of Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, is as follows: He is from Kanazawa Prefecture and is currently 70 years old. He was born in the era of Meiji and graduated from the Faculty of Law of Tokyo Imperial University in the 30th year of Meiji (1897). He passed the Higher Civil Service Examination and served as an official in the Civil Engineering Supervision Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs and concurrently as an official in the Ministry of Home Affairs. He was a Councilor in Yamaguchi Prefecture. In the 32nd year of Meiji (1899), he resigned from his official position and joined Sumitomo Company. In the 33rd year of Meiji (1900), he studied in Europe and America. In the 35th year of Meiji (1902), he returned to Japan and served as a Director and Chairman of Sumitomo Company, Sumitomo Mining Company, Sumitomo Electric Wire and Cable Manufacturing Plant, Sumitomo Warehouse, Sumitomo Chemical Mining Industry Company, and Sumitomo Machinery Manufacturing Company. In the 8th year of Showa (1933), he was appointed as a member of the House of Peers. In the 10th year of Showa (1935), he was appointed as a member of the Cabinet Advisory Council.

<p>Talk by Finance Minister Zhou</p>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Regarding Mr. Ogura Masatsune's acceptance of the position of Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, Finance Minister Zhou Fohai made the following statement: "Mr. Aoki and Mr. Ishiwata, the previous two Supreme Economic Advisors appointed by our country, have made great contributions to our country's financial policies and economic cooperation between China and Japan. We have always considered ourselves fortunate. We are even more excited that Mr. Ishiwata has been honorably transferred to the position of Minister of Finance in our allied nation. The candidate for his successor, Mr. Ogura Masatsune, has now agreed to succeed him as our country's Supreme Economic Advisor. We have great hope for the future of our country's finances and economy. As Minister of Finance in the Konoe Cabinet, Mr. Ogura already had a special understanding of our country. Last time, he visited our country as the head of the Economic Inspection Mission to China and made various statements, demonstrating an even keener understanding. At that time, he paid particular attention to facilitating the exchange of goods and materials, displaying truly insightful views worthy of admiration. This time, he has accepted the appointment to come to China. He will surely use his experience as an veteran financier and his profound economic knowledge, and build upon the achievements of Mr. Aoki and Mr. Ishiwata. He will be able to express his ambitions and make further contributions to the policy-making and construction of our government's finances and economy. We are truly delighted that the great hopes placed in him by our government and the immense expectations held by the people of our nation will be fulfilled."</p>
<p>Talk by Mr. Ogura</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Following Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro's assumption of the position of Minister of Finance for the National Government, it has been decided that Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the President of the Wartime Financial Bank of Japan, will succeed him. Mr. Ogura met with a group of reporters on the 2nd and stated, in essence: "The National Government has invited me to assume the position of Supreme Economic Advisor, and I have fully accepted the National Government's good intentions. Although I am old and of limited talent, now that I have assumed the position of Advisor, I must not only convey Japan's intentions to the National Government, but also sincerely make my greatest efforts for the new China from the National Government's own standpoint. China and Japan are like lips and teeth, and must coexist and prosper together, and must not engage in mutual conflict. I believe that the outbreak and even the expansion of the Sino-Japanese Incident was entirely due to the divisive and hegemonic policies adopted by Britain and the United States. Tracing back to when the National Government joined the war, our country immediately took measures such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, and subsequently implemented a new policy towards China, so that the equal and reciprocal treaty that the Chinese government and public had hoped for for many years was safely established. Therefore, the Chinese side has also gradually understood Japan's true intentions, fully recognizing that China cannot be revived if Japan does not win. Therefore, they resolutely joined the war. It is the same today. From China's point of view, the way to contribute to the Greater East Asia War is to supply Japan with the necessary materials to carry out the war. Last year, I went to China to inspect the state of resources and military strength, and I was very pleased with what I saw. I cannot help but feel grateful for the efforts of those involved. I am determined to make my best efforts in the future to achieve even greater results. Increasing the production of essential goods, as well as increasing the supply of food and procurement materials, is the most important issue for China's economy today. This is inherently linked to the strengthening of Japan's war effort, and also has a major impact on the Chinese people's livelihood. From the point of view of maintaining currency value, it is also a major issue. Therefore, I hope that all sectors in China and Japan will provide guidance at any time, so that I can fully understand the situation and make appropriate decisions from a comprehensive perspective of politics, economy, and finance. China's economic problems are particularly complex, and many cannot be understood with the simple common sense of the Japanese economy. The establishment of the national society, the people's thoughts and actions are also very different from Japan's, I do not want to ignore this point. Regarding the promotion of the new policy, the Chinese government authorities and private economic actors must be allowed to fully exert their original will and engage in all economic construction with a sense of responsibility. Errors are most likely to occur during the transition period of implementing the new policy. At this point, we must abandon the small self and embrace the greater common good. I also intend to do my best to create a spiritual harmony between the economic actors of the two countries. The Greater East Asia War is a war that determines the future of Japan, and also a war that determines the future of China. The Japanese will put the public interest above their own and devote themselves to China's economic construction. I hope that the governments and peoples of China and Japan will provide more assistance."</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Revolutionary Courage</h3>
<p>When the Japanese House of Representatives unanimously passed the "Certain Victory Resolution" on February 5th, Prime Minister Tojo stood up and delivered a speech, stating that the government "will not be bound by what it has done in the past, and will adopt what should be adopted and reform what should be reformed, in order to fully promote the loyalty of the people during wartime." After the reorganization of the Japanese cabinet on February 22nd, at the first cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Tojo further expressed his determination, stating that the government's decision-making, "There may be things we have done in the past that were not thorough. In order to win, we should start anew and do our best to succeed."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo's words, "There may be things we have done in the past that were not thorough," shows his spirit of honesty. Prime Minister Tojo's words, "Reform what should be reformed, adopt what should be adopted, start anew, and do our best to succeed," shows his revolutionary courage. The authorities of the allied nation frankly admit past mistakes and resolutely implement future reforms. They truly have determination and perseverance, which is worthy of our admiration. The Japanese national character is known for being "active and decisive," and the Japanese people do what they say, with a "unity of knowledge and action."</p>
<p>War is an extraordinary event, and the Greater East Asia War is an epoch-making war of liberation. Our enemies will certainly do everything in their power to hinder our liberation. The people in this Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere must work hard to attack externally and work hard to produce internally. The responsible authorities are at the center of everything, and their words and actions are enough to affect the entire country and the entire Greater East Asia. After reading the reform news recently announced by the Japanese government, we know that Japan is reforming everything, whether it is external warfare or internal production. The government authorities are not bound by what they have done in the past, and do not shy away from admitting mistakes. In order to achieve the distant goal of the war of liberation, they do not hesitate to adopt new methods and start anew. The inscription on the Basin of Tang says: "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so from day to day. Yea, let there be daily renovation." This teaches people to constantly renovate themselves, and the current measures taken by Japan are a manifestation of this spirit of daily renewal.</p>
<p>Abolishing old practices and applying new methods is already a matter of urgent importance, which everyone knows, but not everyone can do. The fundamental reason lies in whether or not there is "revolutionary courage." Those with courage speak and act, those without courage speak but cannot act, or even dare not speak. Those with the courage to reform can create new life from the old environment, while those without the courage to reform can only end their old life with the demise of the old environment. The so-called survival of the fittest is the natural law of human evolution. This natural law reveals its importance during wartime. Victory or defeat is the future result, but the cause of victory or defeat lies in whether or not there is the courage to adapt to the environment and reform now.</p>
<p>In wartime, time is the most precious thing, and no one should let their time pass idly. The authorities should not be content with the status quo and waste time. Anything that should be reformed should be done with determination and courage immediately. If you fall behind by one step in time, you will allow the enemy to take the lead by one step in time. The countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are a chain, and the backwardness of any one country in this chain will affect the entire chain. We hope that all people in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will seize the time and resolve to reform.</p>
<h3>Statement by the National Government's Military Propaganda Corps After Arriving in Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, the National Government has specially dispatched a military propaganda corps to Burma in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. It will work closely with the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Provisional Government of Free India in that area to actively promote its work. It is learned that the corps has arrived in Burma and started its activities. On the 2nd, it issued the following statement: "After our friendly nation of Japan issued a declaration of war against Britain and the United States, Chairman Wang of the National Government immediately issued an important statement supporting the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, in order to enrich our national strength, we have been actively engaged in building up our military and are now focusing our efforts on increasing production in order to share the important task of defending East Asia with our friendly nation. In order to go a step further, to actively defeat Britain and the United States, to share greater responsibilities, and to accomplish the Greater East Asia War, this corps has been specially dispatched to Burma to work closely with the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Provisional Government of Free India, as well as other authorities. This year's highest national policy of our country is the greatest mission of this corps to Burma. In the future, we will not fear any sacrifice and are determined to realize the long-cherished hope of liberating the people of Greater Asia. At the same time, in order to realize the lofty ideal of reviving China and defending East Asia as soon as possible, we are determined to firmly believe in sharing life and death with our friendly nation of Japan in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. We hope that the overseas Chinese in all regions will quickly awaken and provide assistance to our country's participation in the war this time. We also urge Chongqing to reflect, so that they can thoroughly recognize the fact that Britain and the United States have invaded China and East Asia, follow the Pan-Asianism of the founding father of our nation, and jointly build the ideal of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity with our friendly nation of Japan under the banner of East Asian national unity, and quickly break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States."</p>
<h3>Peacetime Preparations for Air Defense</h3>
<p>The enemy has finally landed in the Marshall Islands. In the area of the Northern Kuril Islands, enemy planes are constantly attacking. Meanwhile, Japanese armies are actively expanding their air bases on the mainland, watching and planning to launch air raids on our homeland. Looking at the situation around us, we cannot but take strict precautions. Recently, the enemy's air raids on our allied nation of Germany have all been at night, so we should have sufficient awareness and preparation to prepare for nighttime bombing. At the same time, looking at the geographical situation of Japan, we may be suddenly attacked without warning. Even if a warning alarm and an air raid alarm are gradually issued, the time will be very short. Therefore, all families across the country must be fully prepared and pay special attention to the following two points:</p>
<p>Preparation of Shelters</p>
<p>Shelters are temporary trenches for defending the country in the event of an air raid. We must have a place where we can safely entrust our bodies. There are two types of shelters: public shelters and family shelters. Public shelters should be dug to a depth of 1.2 meters, and the surrounding soil should be as high as all sides. Sandbags filled with sand and paved stone floors are prone to collapse and block the entrance, so they should not be used. As a result of building family shelters in various parts of the South, the losses from bombing have been reduced from one-twentieth to one-thirtieth. Therefore, the preparation of family shelters is very important. Shelters dug outside the house are easily damaged and should be repaired frequently. The exit of shelters inside the house should be safe and secure.</p>
<p>Preparation of Water for Fire Fighting</p>
<p>In the event of an air raid, water is the bullet for fire prevention. The more, the better. In Russian areas bombed by Germany, 100 liters of water were prepared for every 100 square meters. Japan has many wooden houses, so it is even more necessary to prepare a large amount of water. All materials should be mobilized in peacetime to build water storage tanks. The location of the water should also be carefully studied and placed in front of the house in the most convenient place for fire fighting, so that there will be no difficulty in the event that an incendiary bomb falls. The area that can be extinguished using a water storage tank is probably within a 7-meter radius centered on the tank. According to European examples, recent urban bombings have been mostly at night, and the enemy's air strikes may also be at night. We must not panic when we are suddenly attacked without warning, and immediately engage in air defense activities. Therefore, all air defense equipment should be prepared in and outside the house on weekdays, and the passage for fire fighting activities should be secured without obstacles.

<h3>The Fighting Armies in the Burmese Territory Maintain Close Ties to Complete the Joint Operations Task</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Burma claimed that the enemy in Burma launched a counterattack after the rainy season last autumn. They started their activities in Yunnan first and then in the Fvgong area. Since this year, they have frequently challenged the Japanese army, but all have been repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy's attempt to reopen the Burma Road to support Chiang Kai-shek and recapture Burma has been frustrated, fully exposing their weakness of lacking control. The Japanese army's Burmese dispatch army has been strengthening and promoting the connection between the Allied forces of the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army. At this time of urgency, it was decided to adopt a more leap forward method. It was decided that the supreme command of the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army will dispatch a staff officer to the supreme command of the Japanese army's land forces in Burma to make close connections in order to complete the task of joint defense and joint operations. Now the Burmese defense army and the Indian National Army are seeing daily preparations and are independent armies, with their solemn array. The establishment of this institution will make the connection between them even closer. In order to cope with the current urgent battle situation and achieve the purpose of the war in the future, there will be amazing activities.</p>

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Peace Treaty: Both Sides Deny</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – The Soviet government, in a broadcast from Radio Moscow on the evening of the 29th, stated: The Soviet government's proposal to Finland for reconciliation cannot be construed as a peace treaty between the two countries. This indicates that the Finnish government acknowledges that when former Finnish Prime Minister Paasikivi met with Soviet Envoy Kollontai, there was no official peace between the two governments, which is sufficient to prove this.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 2nd (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a public statement released by the Finnish government information bureau on Wednesday evening, Finland has not held peace negotiations with the Soviet Union.

<h3>Managing the Grand Canal to Promote the Exchange of Goods: Yin Rugeng Issues Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Yin Rugeng, director of the preparatory office of the Grand Canal Management Committee, recently returned from personally inspecting the southern section of the Grand Canal. He issued a statement to reporters in Shanghai yesterday, saying: The purpose of managing the Grand Canal is to promote the exchange of goods between the north and south, to transport salt from Haizhou and coal from North China to Central China to increase industrial power. However, the management of the Grand Canal is extremely difficult due to the incomplete work of guiding the Huai River in the past. If the problem of guiding the Huai River cannot be solved, the management of the river will also be subject to erosion. According to statistics, from the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty to the present, a period of 260 years, there have been as many as 80 major floods, among which the severe damage has inundated 300,000 mu of farmland. To manage the Grand Canal, it is necessary to consider the problem of guiding the Huai River and draining floodwaters. This time, in order to solicit public opinion and understand the actual situation in various places along the river, a survey team was specially led to conduct inspections, and the results were quite fruitful. The local elders and gentry all expressed their approval, and they deeply hope that the media will continue to provide assistance in the future.</p>

<h3>Hoarded Goods Rush to Market, Prices Gradually Decline, Buyers Wait and See, and the Sale of Spot Goods Decreases Sharply</h3>
<p>High prices and difficult living conditions in this city are an urgent matter. The most pressing task is to suppress prices within a time limit, eliminate illegal hoarding, and increase the allocation of household goods. The competent authorities, recognizing this, have repeatedly consulted and have now agreed on countermeasures. Efforts to clear goods and investigate are underway. As a result, general speculators are already under threat. Therefore, the hoarded goods are rushed to the market to try to sell off at a lower price. Thus, some prices have started to fall recently, with knitted goods falling the most sharply. There are ample spot goods on the market, people are tired, and sales are very sluggish. It is reported that there are approximately three major factors for this decline in prices: (1) The authorities' investigation work is progressing rapidly. There is great fear that hoarded goods will be discovered, confiscated, and legally punished. (2) Credit is extremely tight, and there are difficulties in working capital turnover. (3) The expiration date is approaching, and there is fear that the hoarded goods will deteriorate over time.</p>

<h3>Commemorating the "March 3rd" Friendship Day</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>March 3rd is Shangsi Festival, also known as International Friendship Day. This year is the 33rd year of the founding of the Republic of China, and we are also celebrating the 10th anniversary of International Friendship Day. The times have given me suffering, but friends have given me comfort. A Chinese proverb says, "Parents give me life, friends give me love." We should commemorate our close friends with the heart of commemorating our parents on this special March 3rd festival!</p>
<p>Friendship is one of the five relationships, and making friends is the most beneficial and enjoyable thing in life. The Analects say, "There are three kinds of beneficial friends," and also, "There are three kinds of beneficial pleasures." It is most joyful to have many talented friends and to nurture the talents of the world. Making friends is also the most difficult thing in life. "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black." As you spend time together, habits become ingrained. The relationship greatly affects each person's character and career. Good friends can make you progress and improve, while bad friends can make you regress and fall. In ancient and modern times, many moving, lamentable, hateful, and pitiable events are closely related to the virtue of making friends. Should we not be careful?</p>
<p>Chinese people value faith and righteousness in making friends. Legend has it that Liu Bei and Zhang Fei made a sworn brotherhood in Taoyuan during the Three Kingdoms period, which is still admired by ordinary society. Anyone who partners in business or makes sworn brothers worships the statue of Guan Gong to show the importance of faith and righteousness. So-called loyal friends often maintain the spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>We should have an equal view when making friends and should not have a discriminatory attitude based on class or age. One should respect the old, and the other should cherish the young. Neither should the superior be arrogant nor the inferior be servile. Young people can learn valuable experience and well-intentioned lessons from old friends, while the elderly can also learn the spirit of courage and diligence from young people. The elderly can be strong and enjoy endless happiness.</p>

<h3>A Japanese Submarine's Long Voyage in the Indian Ocean</h3>
<p>As a crew member of a certain submarine, I braved the roaring waves and vastness of the Indian Ocean, a journey of over ten thousand nautical miles.  In the Arabian Sea, bounded by Arabia in the west and India in the east, we continued a prolonged underwater existence.  This state-of-the-art submarine, on its maiden voyage, had already sunk enemy ships one after another, filling our ears with the joyful sound of torpedoes hitting their targets and our eyes with the tragic sight of enemy ships meeting their end. In the Arabian Sea, we have left the mark of our heroic submarine spirit.  I will now describe the circumstances of our naval vessel's disruption of enemy shipping in the Indian Ocean:</p>
<p>Preparing to Set Sail</p>
<p>"Prepare to set sail!"  At the captain's command, a clear bugle call sounded, followed by the starting of the anchor-raising machinery.  Those on board and on land exchanged solemn salutes, waving their hats in farewell.  A base building faded into the twilight scenery, disappearing like a dream.  Then, passing through a channel, the fierce waves of the Indian Ocean tossed us about, not allowing us a moment's rest.</p>
<p>It was at dusk on the [unspecified] day that a signal came from the lead vessel: "Submerge at [unspecified] time, while maintaining original speed."  The silhouette of the vessel then disappeared below the horizon.  A further signal then came from the commander: "Proceed as planned, and may success and good fortune in battle be with you."  Thus, the submarines raced each other to sink enemy vessels, heading west.  Our target was the coasts of Africa and Arabia, where we would disrupt enemy supply lines.  The Indian Ocean is our sea!  After breakfast, as I was about to go to the bridge, a report came from the bridge: "Two merchant ships bearing thirty degrees to port, proceeding to starboard."  The captain immediately went to the bridge. What luck! Only twenty days after starting our offensive, we had already spotted prey. By the time I reached the top, our vessel was already running parallel to the enemy ship, entering the firing position. "It's an enemy oil tanker," the captain calmly said, while smoking a cigarette. Because it was a huge ship with a vast distance between the fore and aft bridges, it was mistaken for two ships. The merchant ship's speed was approximately [unspecified].  According to the captain, a year earlier, they had intercepted a Dutch merchant ship in these waters.</p>
<p>A Huge Oil Tanker</p>
<p>Our ship advanced smoothly to attack, the entire crew eager to pounce on this first enemy ship.  On closer inspection, it was a huge, pale yellow oil tanker, unaware of the impending attack, simply sailing along.  At [unspecified] time, our ship overtook the enemy ship, and at precisely the right moment, we slowed down and prepared to submerge.  At a certain distance from the enemy ship, we submerged and immediately prepared to listen for sound. The navigator said, "Attack at [unspecified] time." When the time came, the captain gave the order. Before long, the torpedo attack began.  Our ship was already preparing to turn around for another attack.  At a depth of about [unspecified], I felt an extraordinary sense of excitement.  Submarines cannot easily surface.  The captain shouted again, "Fire immediately!  Bring the ship to a shallow depth!" as if sensing an unsettling premonition.  The distance to the enemy ship closed to within meters, one second, two seconds... The tension was palpable, but the sound of the torpedo hitting the enemy ship never came.  Sweat appeared on the captain's face.  The captain told me to look through the periscope.  Sure enough, amidst the swirling waves, the enemy ship's massive form remained afloat.  "Launch another attack!" the captain said again, and went to the command post.  Lunchtime had long passed.  How distressed the captain must have been during the meal.</p>
<p>In order to maintain a suitable distance, we surfaced on a certain day and then pursued at high speed. At [unspecified] thirty, on the horizon ahead, we spotted the enemy ship's mast, sailing against the setting sun. From then on, we had to overtake the enemy ship and assume an attack position. Our ship then proceeded to starboard. Before long, the moonlight illuminated the sea, but a haze obscured the view. As a result, the enemy ship on the horizon was no longer visible. The navigator said the enemy ship was to the side, but no sign of it could be seen. Although our ship advanced further, it was unable to find the enemy ship that had escaped into the darkness. At [unspecified] time, the lookout suddenly shouted, "Enemy ship at [unspecified] ahead!" Upon hearing this report, the captain, who was eating fruit after his meal, I watched his calm demeanor, confident that we would surely reap rewards tonight.</p>
<p>From then on, the captain went to the bridge and did not come down again.</p>
<p>Multiple Hits on Enemy Ship</p>
<p>The moonlight shone down on our ship, gradually overtaking several ships. At a certain time, our ship successfully maneuvered into position to attack again and submerged. All the lights in the conning tower were extinguished, plunging us into darkness. The depth was [unspecified]. The captain's eyes were fixed on the merchant ship. "Battle stations!" "Prepare for torpedo attack!" Preparations were swiftly made for the torpedo attack. Then, the order to fire was given. At that moment of attack, the captain was in a state of selflessness. As the torpedoes shot out, before the metallic sound had faded, the sound of explosions had already reached us.  Cries of "Hit!" rang out simultaneously from the conning tower and the command post.  Joy filled the entire ship. The enemy ship, struck by the torpedoes, sent out a distress signal, boasting that it was 25,000 tons in size and would not sink easily.  It continued to transmit for thirty minutes, but finally broadcast, "Abandon ship!" and then the signal was cut off.  The captain, sipping his soda, remained at the periscope.  "Damn thing, let's have another go," the captain resolved to attack again.  Our ship made a turn, and this time we would attack from the enemy ship's port side.  Because ventilation had stopped, the air pressure inside the ship increased, making breathing difficult, and the ship quietly turned its bow.  Then, the final strike was launched. A sound of impact was heard, followed by three loud explosions. The torpedoes had smashed all the guns, and the enemy ship was now without its stern, but it still did not sink. At a certain time, our ship surfaced, and this time the captain decided to use gunfire. Anticipating a counterattack from the enemy, we first prepared the machine guns and then gradually approached, firing at the enemy ship with machine guns, but there was no response. The enemy seemed to have fled.  Our gunners went on deck to carry out a "port-side gun battle."  The waves were fierce, and our ship was tossed about like a small leaf, the gunners fought valiantly amidst the waves.  A thunderous barrage began. The enemy ship's bridge and stern were hit by bombs, and the stern caught fire. The bridge also caught fire. By this time, the moon had set, and on the dark sea, the flames raged. The massive cargo ship was laid to rest deep in the Indian Ocean. Our ship, having achieved its first victory, continued its journey in search of a second prey on the sea before dawn.</p>
<p>The Taste of Flying Fish</p>
<p>Every day, flying fish leaped onto the deck, blessing our journey. We took turns tasting these flying fish.  Being able to eat fish from the Indian Ocean was a special treat for us reporters.  Our submarine crossed the raging waves, heading further west into the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Several days after setting sail, the table was filled with canned goods.  The fresh food we had brought was running out. After dinner, the captain, the chief engineer, and the senior officers gathered in the petty officers' mess to discuss strategy. The submarine had approached enemy territory. When it was time to sleep, we closed our eyes amidst the waves, no different from babies. We are esteemed naval officers. Since [unspecified] month, why had we been training, and why had we come to the Indian Ocean? The old general said, "An army is raised for a thousand days, to be used in a single moment. I hope everyone is vigilant. The key is to spot the enemy first. If the enemy spots us first, then we will be buried at sea. We must resolutely rise up." This was the call to arms as we entered the enemy's area of operations. The wind and rain grew fiercer. Lying in bed, we often heard pinging sounds from the side of the ship, as if we had been hit by bullets. It felt unpleasant. The tension of the Indian Ocean had gripped the entire ship.</p>
<p>Abnormal Life</p>
<p>After the start of a long voyage, daily life had changed accordingly. Even mealtimes could not be fixed. After eating one meal, who knew when the next would be? After a long period of underwater navigation, an unexpected fact was discovered. A malfunction occurred in the number [unspecified] main water tank.  Having been subjected to fierce waves for days, it had sustained a fatal blow.  The ship was in a precarious state.  In its current condition, if it were hit by a depth charge, it would sink if it went below [unspecified] meters.  If we were discovered by the enemy now, self-destruction would be inevitable.  Thus, within [unspecified] nautical miles of the enemy, a desperate operation continued. While a tarpaulin was spread out, the engineering crew worked desperately to repair the damage inside the ship.  Several hours later, our ship returned to normal. We quietly continued our search for the enemy along the Arabian coast.  No one had expected that the day after this desperate repair operation, we would achieve a great victory, discovering a convoy being protected by escort ships. The hero of the day was the navigator. During his watch after breakfast, he unexpectedly spotted a convoy in the indistinct waves. He first spotted two merchant ships and immediately reported it to the captain. The crew then went to their battle stations. Lying in my bed, I heard the torpedo officer shouting, "Merchant ships!" I quickly got up, and in an instant, the ship was transformed into a battlefield. By the time I reached the conning tower, a group of enemy ships had been identified. The captain ordered a torpedo to be fired at [unspecified] time, and after firing, he reported to the conning tower, "There are many more oil tankers!" Then, a rumbling explosion was heard. It was a direct hit on a 25,000-ton oil tanker. A smile appeared on the captain's face. He then ordered preparations for a second torpedo attack. Just as we were about to launch the torpedoes, an enemy submarine chaser was spotted nearby. Because this was the first sighting, the captain decided to abandon the second attack and ordered the ship to submerge. A few minutes later, we reached a depth of [unspecified] meters. Every watertight door was closed, the electric fans were turned off, and even the sound of the electric motors could not be heard. Our ship was proceeding at minimum speed, so the submarine chaser could not detect our location. That orderly operation in the face of the enemy had indeed paid off. Our ship submerged to such a depth without the slightest hint of anxiety. It could be said that we had saved the entire crew from the jaws of death. Before long, three explosions occurred in succession, followed by another, rattling our nerves. The submarine chaser had approached and stopped to listen. The inside of the ship was so quiet that not even a cough could be heard. In the silence, we could sometimes hear the sound of water being drained. At [unspecified] time, a large depth charge exploded, shaking the ship's hull. The enemy ship continued to drop depth charges, and we were now like a candle in the wind. However, due to our ship's silent submersion, the enemy ship still did not know our location and was randomly dropping depth charges. While I was in the midst of this terrifying depth charge attack, I felt as if I was watching a house about to collapse. But there was no terror of death, only trust in our ship. After a while, the enemy ship had moved far away. This struggle with the submarine chaser had indeed resulted in victory. After surfacing, the periscope was raised again. The submarine chaser was attempting to rescue the distressed crew from the oil tanker that was about to sink, circling around and guarding the final moments of that oil tanker. After a long period of submersion, the sun had sunk below the horizon. A faint crescent moon floated above the sea, dimly illuminating the scene. Our ship resumed its search for the enemy and sailed onward.</p>
<p>Leaving Behind Great Achievements</p>
<p>One night, while I was reading in the petty officers' mess, the medical officer rushed in and said, "I saw a merchant ship!" I quickly went up to the bridge, and a huge black object appeared on the horizon. Our ship immediately planned to catch up with the enemy ship at high speed, but the enemy ship disappeared in the haze and was no longer visible. We had missed a good opportunity this time.</p>
<p>On another day, I was awakened by the sound of an alarm. Our ship and a submarine chaser were only [unspecified] meters apart. The submarine chaser appeared in the fog, with a merchant ship in front of it. The submarine chaser was about to fire at our ship. Our ship steered to starboard. Although the enemy ship had not detected us, we had no choice but to abandon the attack. We temporarily mustered our courage and continued to patiently search for the enemy ship, until we ran out of oil and food. We will leave behind great achievements along the Arabian coast.

<h3>Map of the Greater East Asia Railway Plan from Tokyo to Syonan - Diagram Note</h3>
<p>—Unrealized</p>
<p>The trunk railway begins in Tokyo, passes through Korea, Manchuria, China, Vietnam, Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, and ends in Syonan. The journey through Saigon would take nine days, eleven hours, and thirty minutes, and a direct route to Bangkok would take eight days, three hours, and forty minutes. Currently, the unfinished sections of the trunk line are only the Guangdong-Zhennanguan section and the Punata-Khonken-Saigon-Phnom Penh section. The required expenses are approximately 7.5 billion to 8 billion yen. Materials and labor can be collected locally. Once completed, it will become the main artery of East Asia, and the abundant resources of the South can be transported smoothly to South China, Central China, the North, and Japan without having to go by sea. Preparations for a survey are currently underway. (According to the February 5th Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<h3>Missing My Younger Brother</h3>
<p>— Tang Min</p>
<p>—Recalling when we lived together, his voice and appearance fill my mind and ears.</p>
<p>I remember a poet saying, "A person who lives on memories shows that his life is only left with some residual dregs." This sentence sent shivers down my spine. I knew that I was still very young and should not torture myself with memories or erode the vitality of my youth, but what could inspire me? I sighed. If I forced a smile when I should cry, wouldn't I become a madman?</p>
<p>It was raining outside, and I locked myself in the room. Loneliness and sorrow made me think of the joys and sorrows of the past, and a shadow struck my heart. He had a round face and wore black-rimmed glasses on the bridge of his nose. He always smiled before speaking, which made people feel indescribably warm. Perhaps because he was a little younger than me, I called him "Younger Brother," but in fact, he was an older brother to a group of younger siblings who had lost their parents.</p>
<p>They were without a home. He and his siblings were all living in a school where his aunt was the principal. In those years, the cost of living was rising day by day. He relied on the few savings left by his father, which were not a very large amount, to support his own and his siblings' education and living expenses. It was such a difficult thing! Let me use the phrase "exhausted in body and mind" to describe him! He finally fell ill in the summer.</p>
<p>Upon receiving this unfortunate news, I went to see him. I put a bouquet of flowers in a vase made from a sugar bottle and softly called out to him. He lazily moved his eyelids and smiled at me.</p>
<p>"How do you feel?"</p>
<p>"It's just that I coughed up a few mouthfuls of blood," a faint smile appeared on his face, "It's really annoying, especially during the exams!"</p>
<p>He sighed heavily, saying that if he graduated half a year late, he would have to take away another portion of living expenses from his younger siblings, which would be like shortening his own life by half a year. Time was so precious to him!</p>
<p>I could understand what he meant. I was afraid that he would get too excited, which would be bad for his health, so I told him a joke to stop his complaining. But my own eyes became inexplicably wet.</p>
<p>For the sake of convenience, he went to a hospital to recuperate for a month. Once, I took a friend to see him. He greeted us with a smile and accompanied us for a walk on the lawn. He calmly told us that a person had died in his hospital room a few days earlier, and his feelings were like this:</p>
<p>"...I saw the nurse holding her face with both hands and screaming, then desperately shrinking into the quilt. I thought to myself that I can't die, I can't die, I have such a group of younger siblings!"</p>
<p>After that, he gradually recovered, and his friends were happy for him. Many of us often went to his place to chat, and his room was nothing less than a meeting place for friends. We would chew on peanuts there, wasting the entire afternoon, saying heated words that even we didn't fully understand.</p>
<p>He was worried about the happiness of his younger siblings. He said that he had spent a lot of money on his illness and wondered how he would get by in the future:</p>
<p>"I have to make it up to them, Min!"</p>
<p>He said this so resolutely.</p>
<p>Half a year later, he seemed to have changed somewhat. He no longer talked to me about his younger siblings. "...I should think more deeply and broadly. The survival of my younger siblings is connected to this deeper and broader problem." These words surprised me, and I was secretly shocked to find myself growing old.</p>
<p>Just like that, the whole year was about to disappear in the wind and rain. One day, near the end of the lunar year, a friend came to my place, gasping for breath. With great effort, he finally said that "Younger Brother" had disappeared.</p>
<p>"...He said in a letter that he could no longer take away the resources for his younger siblings... For the sake of their survival, he had to leave this place!"</p>
<p>--Where did he go?</p>
<p>From that day on, I pondered this question.</p>
<p>I remember that for several years, on the first day of the lunar new year, I always took him to pay a new year's call on the father of a classmate who had taught us. For the first two years, I was wandering elsewhere, and I didn't think about this. This year, I was at home for the new year, and when I thought that I could no longer invite him to go with me, my heart was filled with melancholy.</p>
<p>I looked up at the sky: I hope that my old friend is safe and well everywhere! (Forget-Me-Not No. 2)</p>
<h3>The Solitary Goose</h3>
<p>— Hua Sheng</p>
<p>Friends:</p>
<p>Perhaps you will be quite surprised when you receive this letter! After a long period of silence, I have wandered from the distant North to this place. You may have thought that I was no longer in this world--falling away like a morning star, unknown to anyone. Indeed, I am as faint as a star, but I have not fallen!</p>
<p>Life brings happiness, but it also brings misfortune. But in my short life, do you know how my soul has been scourged and torn apart by misfortune? I have repeatedly wanted to resist this misfortune with death, but the desire for life has pulled me back. I continue to endure the scourging and tearing, and to fight against my misfortune. You think this is because I am afraid of death? Cowardly? --No, I need a life with meaning, and continuing to struggle with life is true courage!</p>
<p>Of course, a person with a fulfilling life would not think of these things, but friends, please try to remove the colored lenses of life, and you will recognize what life is.</p>
<p>A flock of geese in the sky is singing loudly, flapping their full wings and flying everywhere. In their orderly formation, none of them would ever think of a companion who has left the flock and flown south. Although they fly high into the clouds, they are blinded by the haze and have lost their direction. Friends, for the sake of your life, struggle, fight, conquer life! Don't let the reality of life blind you to the direction of your life!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Poems on Friendship Day</h3>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>The auspicious festival of March 3rd has arrived, the plum blossoms shine bright in our eyes. We hang up portraits of Yan Pingzhong, and write poems to celebrate Huang (Jingwan) xiānsheng (honored teacher). I can entrust the plain silk to him, and his talent amazes the world. We hope that after a cup of wine together, the world will love peace. (Wang Jiaji)</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Meeting this auspicious festival away from home, the meaning of friendship is particularly fine. Friends must share in times of danger, even when people are at the ends of the earth. The oaths made on carriage and hat are often forgotten, but I wish to give away my clothes and furs. Who can be like Bao Shuya and Guan Zhong, reversing clouds and rain together? (Zhao Ximing)</p>
<h3>Spring Swallow</h3>
<p>— Jin Shi</p>
<p>"Spring" brings people vigor and vitality.</p>
<p>The rape flowers that bloom in the fields add a layer of golden yellow to the green expanse. The willow embankment is reflected in the water, and the peach blossoms on the opposite bank. In the charming scenery, swallows with streamlined wings fly by, skimming the surface of the water and stirring up beautiful ripples. With the arrival of the swallows, the earth warms up.</p>
<p>The swallow, with only fragile wings and a short body, is truly a warrior in the stormy waves, the vanguard of spring.</p>
<p>The swallow is like a falling leaf, a drifting duckweed, without a fixed home. It entrusts its life to the vast sky, flies like clouds, and soars on the white waves of the sea. It is as free as a fairy. The blue sea and clear sky are its long journey. It tracks the warmth, struggling for life.</p>
<p>Spring has come to Jiangnan again. The warriors who track the warmth form neat formations and fly from the distant horizons and boundless corners of the sea, soaring through the air. They flap their skillful wings, flying across mountains and rivers, crossing heavy fog, avoiding the raging waves, and completing their arduous and great journey. During such a long journey, they do not turn back because of fatigue. They exert their greatest perseverance and finally cross thousands of miles of mountains and rivers, arrive in Jiangnan, breathe the breath of spring, and wander in the world of spring.</p>
<p>Spring is so full of poetry! Green mountains, clear waters, and green willows are all a comfort and encouragement to the hearts of wanderers. Flying in this happy world, without worry or sorrow, how carefree and content they are! Whether it is a carved beam and painted building or a dilapidated tile and thatched roof, they will excitedly carry mud and grass to build their new nests. Whether it is the "Wang Xie mansions" or "ordinary people's homes," they do not distinguish between high and low. They are content wherever they live, without the pain of being displaced. They chirp happily in their small nests, which is the joy of life!</p>
<p>Until spring leaves Jiangnan and the autumn wind plays a dirge, they will flap their wings again and fly high, continuing to track the trail of spring and warmth. Therefore, their environment is always so fresh and beautiful, and their lives are always young and free.</p>
<p>However, I am trapped in this suffocating siege of depression, living a life like dead wood, and trapping my inherent soul in a frozen cellar, lacking the freedom of the swallow. Although I have great perseverance and courage, I do not have strong wings to break through the dark clouds and rush into the free sky.</p>
<p>I love my home and I love my homeland. But in order to save myself from the depths of the mud and make my life as smooth as washing, I have to entrust my "future" to a distant journey and strive for great freedom. It does not have to be Plato's ideal state or Tao Yuanming's Peach Blossom Spring, as long as it is a fresh environment and a free world.</p>

<h3>Re-match with First Police, Discussing Eastern China's Offense and Defense Methods, Paying Attention to First Police's Strengths - Setting Up Countermeasures</h3>
<p>This Sunday’s football match between Eastern China and First Police is a scene from the second round of the Football Association. Remembering that Eastern China narrowly won the first round against First Police with a score of three to two, this paper is happy to make an early discussion of the ways of offense and defense.</p>
<p>First, let's look at First Police, how do they win? On the offensive side, they only rely on the scurrying of Little Yellow Hair. In the first round, the old * followed step by step, but with a flash of the eye, the old hen turned into a duck, and he still scored two goals. This person is truly the only dangerous person. Not only is the scurrying fast, but the passing is also accurate, and the shooting is skillful. On the defensive side, they all rely on endurance. Throughout the game, they are strong, especially Ci Lai Tuo, an old and cunning veteran, who is very skilled in every aspect. Their tactics use long passes, which are very effective against small schools. The above are the characteristics of First Police. Knowing this, how should Eastern China pay attention to the coordination of offense and defense? I will briefly express my humble opinion as an aid to the wise. Talk about Attacking</p>
<p>The opponent's goalkeeper, Funik, is good at setting up open goals, so the shooter does not need to use too much force. To avoid losing the target, the focus should be on cleverness. The mastermind of the defense, Ke Lai Tuo, is probably paying attention to Sun Jinshun, this price is *. Old Sun should use more of the tactic of luring him to steal the ball, and pass into the open space at the appropriate time. Li Yao and Long Hai should try their best to run more, so that they can get more open spaces, and the effect can be seen immediately. And Han Longhai should pay attention to offside, otherwise it will be like *, and all the effort will be wasted, which is the most regrettable. As for the winger Jia Youliang, although Yu * Hua Ken is watching him, because of his old qualifications, he should still focus on high and far shots. However, when hooking the ball, he should carefully pass it to a sparsely populated landing point, so that the other four people all have the ability to get the ball. A Dai is generally guarded by Tie Funik, so there is nothing to worry about. Although A Dai is old, his style of dribbling is still there, and Tie will inevitably make mistakes, and A Dai * can help from it. But I hope to provide Han Longhai with more opportunities to scurry in (Li Yao can also scurry), then it will be easier to succeed.</p>
<p>On Guarding</p>
<p>Generally, it is believed that Little Yellow Hair should be guarded to the death by Yi Fuzhen (as in the first round). This is indeed a last resort. I believe that the center-back must have the momentum to assist in the attack, otherwise, if the front and back are disconnected, the offensive momentum will inevitably be weakened. Therefore, Tan should not put all his energy into guarding. Instead, the responsibility of guarding Little Yellow Hair should be borne mainly by Zhang Linggen, because Zhang is in good shape. If Little Yellow Hair gets the ball, he should be able to bump into him while running (there are regulations in football that allow bumping, but it must not be a foul). (Little Yellow Hair will have difficulty going straight after being bumped by Zhang (as is often seen)), then Little Yellow Hair's path will be cut off, and the forwards will not be able to respond freely. What is there to fear about Mai Qidang's feet? Tan can assist more in the attack, and should not be suspicious of dribbling. Furthermore, Li Ning and Zhuang Youren's positions should be particularly appropriate, because if they are positioned well, it can easily make the opponent go offside, but on the contrary, they will not be able to catch up and there will be danger. If they are too far back, it will be easy to let the wolf into the house, which is also quite dangerous, so the two must study their positions, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>In short, both Eastern China and First Police have been playing better and better recently. Both teams have players who are good at scurrying, Han Longhai of Eastern China and Little Yellow Hair of First Police. Facing scurrying, the wonderfulness of the scene can be imagined. According to news from First Police, they suffered a disastrous defeat of one goal in the last game, and they are now recuperating and aiming to avenge their defeat. Eastern China, on the other hand, has the championship in hand, and the honor of being a constant winner. How can they let it slip away? The wooden week will be a sensation for a while, and the Yiguo field will be crowded with people. I hope that our athletes will exert their power and live up to the enthusiasm of the thousands of fans. This is why the reporter wrote this research. (Jie)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament Talking about the Strength of Participating Group A Teams</h3>
<p>The Western Youth Basketball Tournament has just ended, and the Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament follows closely, which shows that Shanghai is most concerned about basketball. Looking at the Group A teams in the * Open Tournament, most of them are the original teams from the Western Youth Tournament. Only the Eastern Amateur Three Wheels Three teams have disbanded invisibly, and there are also teams such as Zhongbei, Eastern China Friendly Team, and All-Stars. Here is a brief description of the strength of several emerging Group A teams:</p>
<p>Zhongbei</p>
<p>Originally one of Shanghai's mobile brigades, it is also a master of the Northern School. When it joined the Western Youth Tournament, it had the ambition to win the championship, but then its main player Li Zhenzhong was injured in the foot, which affected its strength, and it withdrew. This time, Li's injury has healed and he has recovered his heroic spirit. The reputation of his peers such as national players Shen Yugong and Xu Zhaoxiong is very strong. The Northern School's tactics may not necessarily adapt to the current situation, but with its emphasis on personal skills and rich experience, it is still very likely to overwhelm the group.</p>
<p>Friendly Team</p>
<p>It is a disguised version of the former Xu Fang team. Players such as Dong Xiaopei, Tao Shaosheng, Zou Ziren, He Xiaoguang, Fan Qingxian, Song Qihou, and Li * De have been in the same team for a long time and have good contact. What is even more noteworthy is that the team is good at guarding, which is better than other teams, so the stronger the opponent, the more energetic the team is. Therefore, the team will definitely become a team that specializes in creating upsets in the future. It can threaten strong teams, but it may not be able to easily defeat weak teams, because the whole team lacks a player who is good at shooting baskets.</p>
<p>Eastern China</p>
<p>Under the banner of the Eastern China Athletic Association, judging from its football record, it is very bright and outstanding. On the basketball court, it is rarely seen to cooperate. Judging from their individual achievements, players such as Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Zhang Banglun are also strong players, but it is impossible to speculate on the strength of Fan Fuzhen, Zhang Linggen, and others. In the end, the whole team has sufficient energy, but the tactics may not be wonderful. It is difficult to expect how well they will do. They are only qualified to be in the middle range.</p>
<p>All-Stars</p>
<p>It is organized by the staff of the China-West Great Pharmacy. Team members such as Shi Jiuquan and Shen Da originally participated in the battle of the China Southern Team. This time, they set up a new path and invited veterans Chen Xuechong and Wang Jinghu to join. Judging from the talents, it cannot be said that there is no hope.</p>
<p>Morning Friends</p>
<p>Originally a team in Group B, Pan Jianhua joined and directed it from the middle. The team strives to move up, and its courageous battle will be worth watching.</p>
<p>United</p>
<p>The original team of the former Zhongyi team also had a good reputation in the past. This time, they are making a comeback, and we sincerely hope that they will not be disappointed. However, I have witnessed their recent performance, and it is not what it used to be. It has fallen sharply. People have not aged, but their basketball skills have declined. If they do not try hard to practice, they may inevitably fall behind.</p>
<p>Lianhua is the B team of Hualian. It joined the B team in the Western Youth Tournament and joined the A team in the China Youth Tournament. It has its own role to play. Players such as Xu Ju Busheng, Yan Youling, and Qu Yanlong often practice in the gym. Familiar with the venue, they should be able to gain a lot of advantages and may be expected to achieve considerable results.</p>
<p>Shenma</p>
<p>Also a "Qu Luren" team in the Western Youth B group, and the giant Sass King, the whole team relies on its burly body as its only characteristic. However, their skills are still immature. A reckless man's courage will only be seen as a waste of energy.</p>
<p>As for the Renyu team with the addition of Zhang Shaoqing, the Dahua team with the participation of Lu Zhongen and Xu Nu Kui, and the Hua * team with the help of Bao Songyuan, they have all increased their strength, and it is not difficult to see the intentions of each team. However, the Tongren team will become a pure Yijia team due to Zhang Banglun's service to Eastern China. Its strength will inevitably be diminished, and its record will also be inferior because of it. (Skinny Reporter)</p>
<h3>Introducing Two Emerging Women's Basketball Teams "Dahua" "Kang Ai" The Ladies are All Athletes</h3>
<p>This weekend, the * Open Basketball League will open in Zhongqing. In the women's group, the first game will be between Dahua and Kang Ai.</p>
<p>Dahua</p>
<p>Dahua brings together the best players from the universities and the two schools of China-West and St. Mary's, so its strength is naturally strong. The forwards include Captain Ying Meijuan and her sister Meiyu, both famous softball players. Badminton player Shen Shu, who currently works for a certain book company, is an all-around athlete. Liu Zhaolan is a famous player from South China, and Liu Fookee's sister has learned all her brother's skills. Wang Fengzhen is currently a physical education coach in China-West, so her skills are naturally extraordinary. There is also the clever and lively little sister Deng Qiyao. The whole team is fierce in attack. The defenders include the bodybuilding sisters Yang Jing and her sister Renfen. The Yang brothers and sisters are enthusiastic about sports and are responsible for the men's and women's teams of Dahua. Cheng Mulan is a famous softball pitcher in this city. Shen Xunling is a medical student with a busy schedule, and it is commendable that she can take the time to play basketball. The Xue sisters Deyin and Weiyin are tall and are strong players in the Basketball Association. The whole team is full of talents, and there is hope for winning the championship this year.</p>
<p>Kang Ai</p>
<p>The Kang Ai women's basketball team was newly formed at the end of last year. Most of the team members are students of Yueda University. The captain, Wang Yide, is tall and passes and shoots like a man. Miss Qian Ronghuan is also a sports athlete from the former Beiping Mei Tong, and is also a classmate of the movie star Wang Yuan. Li Xiuzhen is the sister of Li Guofan, a famous tennis player in this city. Her family has a long history, so her basketball skills are naturally impressive. The three mermaids who once won the swimming championship in this city, Shen Xunming, Cheng Jinqiao, and Liu Tianchun, are all basic members of the team. Chen Suqin and Miss Ye Jinrong are the double-braided generals. The little sisters Wu Zhiwen and Ma Yansheng are former athletes from Gongnu Middle School, and are proud disciples of the female physical educator Chen Yongsheng, along with the green team's Huang Mingyuan. The Wang sisters, Danyun and Danyue, play basketball lightly and casually, like the clouds and moon in the sky. Miss Wang Shouzhen, a famous picker, has been learning basketball for a short time, and her skills have already reached a high level. It is a pity that when practicing, she always likes to go out to see dramas with her boyfriend. In addition, there is also Miss Ya Ruyu, who is as beautiful as a flower. The good chocolate girl from South China, nicknamed Judy Garland, came to the field to cheer even though she did not play that day. The whole team is full of talents, but unfortunately there is too little time to practice. The purpose of participating in this league is to learn from each other's skills, and the victory or defeat is not counted.</p>
<p>Dahua and Kang Ai are sister teams, and everyone is a classmate. Unexpectedly, they met in the first game. The infighting is of course tense. A wonderful performance can be predicted. The latest news is that Dahua will wear brand-new satin outfits on the day, and the Shanghai fans will have a feast for the eyes. (Meike)</p>
<h3>Sports News</h3>
<p>— Yi De</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the Basketball Referees Association held a meeting at the private residence of the president, Dai Changling, to discuss the supply of referees in the Open Basketball Tournament, to be prepared for any eventuality, and it can eliminate various shortcomings.</p>
<p>Guoqiang Middle School is currently holding the Central Ball Level Championship. This sport is most suitable for junior high school students and girls. I hope that all schools will visit and promote it.</p>

<p>In this Open Basketball Tournament, all sectors have expressed that the arrangements for the order of the Group A, Group B, and women's groups are not perfect enough in terms of time. It is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost. I hope to improve it!</p>
<p>The Zhongqing competition uses international rules, which have many differences from the Western Youth rules. Players can refer to Liu Hesheng's article "Differences between the Two Rules" published in this publication earlier.</p>
