<h3>代論　第六次諮詢會觀感</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>——樹立滬市七縣模範區問題——</p>
<p>本市市政諮詢委員會，前日舉行第六次委員會議，本人葠與其間，得聆市政當局　各主管人員的議論與報告，以及同人對於市政各方面的意見，獲益匪淺。茲就觀感抒述如次：</p>
<p>這次大會討論提案中，最重要者是諮詢會建議，滬市所屬七縣樹立模範區問題，提案內容，大部分意見正與本報七月二十八日社評所提供者約略相同。不過補充說明的，最近內政部規定南滙縣爲實驗模範縣，而諮詢會提出整個滬市的七縣，完全成爲模範縣。因爲七縣是上海的外圍，如果其中一縣成爲模範縣，事實上是不可能的。縱使一縣成了模範縣，不能發生外圍的整個作用，與整個上海市政無十分裨益的。況且，在目前所謂模範縣，不過縣政的革新，恢複應行設施的縣政，使之　於正執爾已。距離「模範」，實尚遼遠。</p>
<p>本報社評說過，模範縣的促成，必須願到四點：第一，確立各縣區的行政制度。第二，健全各縣區的行政人事。第三，整理各縣的財政收支。第四，維護各縣區的治安問題。而尤以縣長人選問題最爲重要，如無優秀人才擔任縣長，則一切完善制度，整理議案徒成具文，得不到分毫實效。現在和平區內，大多數縣區具有特殊情形，環境惡劣，老實說，優秀人才出任縣長，不能安於其位的，不得不得勝特殊勢力，才可立足。其次，少數地方上的敗類或粗　日語者，聰穎或　蔽日本一二當局，極從　推驚，一旦走馬上任，就是胡作胡爲，不顧廉恥。這一種人，誠如吉田東祐先生分析的所謂第二種親日派，他們根本無國家觀念，無人民觀念，既沒有中國，也沒有日本，無非是自己個人的利害。以這種人擔任縣長，期其推進縣政，改善人民生活，自然是南轅北轍了。所以，我們不主張模範縣則已，否則必須慎重縣長人選，上海市的七縣，與整個上海有著　關係，欲期上海成爲全國政淪模範區，必先使七縣成爲模範區，必先自慎重七縣縣長人選入手。絕對採取人才主義，不受任何方面牽制干涉。並進而希望盟邦各地當局協助篩選好人，損傷縣長。諮詢會這一建議，市長即　接受。我們認爲便於從速實施計，組織一個委員會，專事討論實施步驟及各種對策，以期早日實現。</p>
<p>其次，陳市長在開會致詞中，熱切闡釋人事的重要。所謂「人人無事，事事無人」，對於中國公務人員的大病，可說一針見血慨乎定之。陳市長並指出一般主管人員對於用人方針，喜歡任用同鄉親戚，同鄉親戚並非絕不可用，必須顧到有無才能。如果心存偏袒，以爲同鄉親戚人盡可用，則結果自會形成「人人無事，事事無人」，特囑各主管當局注意及之。並表示刷新文官制度，將先自上海實行。</p>
<p>總之，人事問題，在中國政治史上居於主宰地位，人事健全，則政治興盛，人事不健全，則政治衰　。目前更處於動亂之餘，地方政治一切失常，非以最健全的人事處理行政，實不足以言革新與進步。</p>
<h3>日小磯首相廣播　總力把握勝利　確立人類之道義果敢挫敵</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電，日本小磯首相廣播之大意如次：世界戰局，目下已轉入曠古未有之大戰，亦正日本遭逢空前絕後之困難之時，當此之際，本人與米內海軍大將協力組織內閣，與國民諸君竭誠共赴國難，不勝恐懼之至，就任後不久，即　大東亞戰爭紀念之日，謹述所懷，奉答聖論，今戰爭勃發以來，已屇兩年又九個月，敵因深刻之苦惱，與內外情勢所迫，乃欲於短期內決定勝負，遂侵入馬利亞納羣島，有一舉突入我本土之勢。同時，新幾內亞方面亦徐徐進攻，企圖我本土與南洋之交通，斯時也，正我日軍已接近果敢作戰，與後方一億國民集中總力，粉碎敵軍野心之秋。餘藉此機會，奉誓大詔，與國民諸君共同認識此次大東亞戰爭之　目的，並期堅固吾等必勝信念，以現在情勢觀之，敵空軍雖保不侵入我國本土，事既如此，其結論亦極節單，即以皇祖所明示之神勅及大詔之所指示，唯有結集總力，排隊一切障礙，以把握勝利。其把握勝利之途，又如大詔所示，吾等臣民絕對信仰天皇之大御業，各就其職，遂行其使命，確信具有此種信念，而發揮一億一心之總力，其結果必能發出貫穿宇宙之威力。扶　天壤無窮之皇運，必能獲得完全　勝利，導皇國立於悠久磐石之上。軍官民一致發揮其各自之使命之時，自能確立人類最高道義，果敢挫敵之戰力，亦因而發生，際此大東亞戰爭得能鋒利勝利之時，本人確信此即必勝信念之本體，願以此千國民諸君。又政府已　中一切施策，向勝利之途邁進，自不待嘗，最近所設最高戰爭指導會議，亦努力急速增强武力，安定國民生活之機構也。重續言之，今皇軍果敢作戰，後方一億民衆完全武裝，策結總力，粉碎敵軍野心之時機已至，今日實報答天皇陛下之唯一重大戰局，餘確信一億國民之最良機會，今日若行錯過，則不複來臨矣。</p>
<h3>湘戰局入新階段　日軍昨佔領衡陽　完成擊滅反軸心軍布陣</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營八日下午五時三十分　表：前此包圍衡陽之日軍，於八月四日黃昏開始總攻，當擊滅與駐渝美軍共守該市之渝軍三師，已於八日上午八時，將該市完全佔領。</p>
<p>湖南日軍前幾八日中央社電　渝美空軍基地衡陽，已爲日軍攻陷，湖南戰局，因此進入決定局面，大陸戰線更形勢一新，而進入新階段。引次作戰與從來所謂大陸作戰，根本性格不同，日軍以重大決心發動攻勢，即將河南及湖南兩作戰分別而觀，亦可知其規模計劃之如何雄大，可謂過去七年中，規模最大之作戰，對於渝軍戰略據點，以東西防線爲外圍，二重包圍，擊滅渝軍主力，結果連絡合華北、華中之動脈平漢路，遂成爲對渝攻勢之新陣線。一響以衡陽爲頂點，江西省信豐，廣西省梧州，柳州爲底邊之一　，在渝美空軍基地，亦蒙受重大威脅。同時確保川湘公路之關門湘潭，進入貴族四川之門戶已大開，兩次作戰，日軍紀律嚴明，認清大東亞戰爭之正確目標，於中、日親善關系這推進，日軍現今從漸揚子江南北七百公里之廣漢　，整個戰局新階段，完成擊滅反軸心軍之布陣，日美英在大陸戰之決戰，蓋已正式揭幕矣。</p>
<p>日本某基地八日中央社電　此次日軍攻陷衡陽，其意義不在城市之取得，而在於渝漢空軍基地飛行場　之　取。該地爲駐渝美空軍一日不可或離之空軍老巢，上年三月在渝第十四空軍隊獨立後，成爲渝方擾亂華中之作戰基地，飛武漢地區之空　，長江方面艦船之攻擊，武昌、岳州間粵漢鐵道之破壞，俱以衡陽爲基地，尤有進者，敵人五方面將日方航空兵力吸引於衡陽，乘此間隙實行日本本土之轟炸，三十二年以來，各地之航空決戰，曾不斷展開，日空軍並予桂林，衡陽及零陵三地機場以痛擊，過去三年間，衡陽上空曾發生二百鎰之空戰，然日機始終佔優勢，在衡陽上空擊落或擊毀及起火之敵機，至今日止已達二百架以上，茲衡陽已被日軍攻陷，美空軍早於長沙陷落時放棄衡陽，將航空兵撤至桂林零陵方面，故衡陽之喪失，無疑已使敵人髮生喪失湘贛間方面一帶全部飛行　之恐懼。</p>
<p>衡陽日軍前線八日中央社電　日軍攻入衡陽市街後，城內渝軍戰意遂告喪失，至八日拂曉，渝軍第十軍軍長方先覺，及參謀長蔡雨期，第三師師長週　柔，第一百九十師師長楊有略，預備第十師代理師長李　夫，第五十四師師長饒少偉　等，需內渝軍最高指揮者當即揚白旗，李部向日軍投降。</p>
<p>廣州八日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍事委員會七日發表戰報，業承認日本軍隊入衡陽市街北部，日軍由湘潭山方面，陸續增援，一日夜以猛烈砲火掩護，猛攻衡陽市內外前方陣地，當與城內渝守軍展開血戰。至六日晨，日軍一部隊敨衡陽北部陣地，同時，另一部日軍刻正與市外西南部渝軍陣地之强烈總隊於高地週圍展開壯烈爭殺戰。又蓮花，茶陵，耒陽，安仁南方湘鄉，　鄉方面，亦在戰鬥中。又廣東之廉江城外及縣西南地區，亦正激戰中。</p>
<p>湖南前線八日中央社電　耒陽方面渝軍，自七月下旬以來，爲救援衡陽，繼續　中，自在平日爲日軍包圍，巨型激烈白刃戰，刻仍激戰中。渝第二十六，九十九及暫編第三軍等，爲救援衡陽贈在耒陽南方八公里小水鋪附近凖備進攻日軍，日軍於在平日即在五里鋪（耒陽西北二公里）附近擊潰渝軍先鋒總隊，由三方面予以包圍，至五日夜日軍一部隊渡過嫠江，奇襲渝軍背面，嶄斷其退路，並自四面施以犯攻，故渝軍三軍已陷危境。</p>
<h3>日軍進駐衡陽　軍紀整肅　佈告保護良善居民</h3>
<p>湖南日軍前線八日中央社電　此次盟邦軍隊發動湖南作戰，其動機純　基於打破百年來　姓中國，侵略東亞之英美共同敵人及其附庸勢力之喻方，發動以來，不移時，而該省重鎮長沙，岳陽，　陵，瀏陽，湘潭等軍事要地，相繼攻陷，今位於粵漢，湘桂兩鐵路線交叉點之衡陽，複於八月八日易腐爛　告攻佔，至此，湖南作戰，已因衡陽之攻陷，而進入另一階段。此次盟軍進駐衡陽，軍紀整肅，秋毫無犯，對善良民衆，更竭盡保護之實，蓋其作戰對象，僅爲粉碎英美附廣勢力之喻僞穀子，而廣大民衆，乃爲大東亞共榮圈內之有力夥伴，故除嚴厲誥誡軍士，絕對禁止有騷擾鄉民等種種不法行爲外，並佈告境內民衆，勿自驚擾，各安其業，更　重保證民衆所有之生命，財産及其他一切天賦人權，在駐兵區內絕無徽收捐稅，或拉夫徽兵等事，對各地鄉村習慣，亦絕對尊重，是坆，民衆聞訊無不額手稱慶，相寧來歸，管理方式其安居樂之優美生活，茲將佈告原文錄後：「爲佈告事日本軍此次進駐當地，目的在於打破英美犧牲中國侵犯東亞之傳統的野心，協助中國，確立主權，完成自由，並謀中日親善關系之促進實現，義師所向，有攻必克，擊破英美及其附庸勢力，實行保境安民，務寗居民安居樂業，勿信謠言，自相驚擾，下列數端，咸使開端，庶明本軍大義，　日軍暫時駐兵，戰至保境安民完全實現。　日軍戰重保證駐兵區內民衆生命及其他一切天賦人權。　日軍駐兵區內絕無徽收捐稅或拉夫徽兵等事，凡區內民衆協力本軍，提供物資或勞力，一律付給充分大酬。　日軍承認駐兵區內再造鈔幣及中央儲備券同時流通。　日軍半生鄉村習慣，協助種花人實施自治制度，但日軍截至治安　定時此，暫施軍政，爲此佈告週知，仰本區人民一體週知，勿背義軍精神　要，切切此布。」</p>
<h3>行政院會議</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　行政院於八日舉行第二一九次會議，討論事項：　院長交議，據社會福利部丁部長呈送戰時房屋租賃爭議處理法草案一案，　先飭據本院秘書處召集司法行政社會福利兩部會同審查，簽具意見請公決案，決斷照審查意見通過，呈中政會。任免事項：㈠院長提，擔任命裴依山爲淮海省第一區行政督察專員，王效會爲第二區行政督察專員，張江栽爲第三區行政督察專員，徐桂爲第四區行政督察專員，胡繼芳爲第五區行政督察專員，王志清爲第六區行政督察專員案，決戰通過。　院長提，安徽省清鄉事務局局長也密鏗另有任用，擬予免職，並擔任命魏　東爲安徽省清鄉事務局局長，林仰漢、溪爲安徽省第五區行政督察專員，黃一平爲安徽省第七區行政督察專員，已呈請國府分別任免，請追認衆，決議通過追認。　宣傳部林部長提，本部編審也君佐量請辭職，擬請免職，並擬宣傳司司長案，決議通過。　上海特別市政府陳市長呈，擬請任命馮赦爲本市物品配給處處長案，決議通過。</p>
<h3>日外務省調查　美兵獸行</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　美兵以在太平洋戰線陣亡之日軍能幹頭蓋骨，製作紀念品，送往本國玩賞，美國會議員複將日軍兵士之腕骨，製成裁約刀贈與大總統，此咱野蠻獸行，其驚人程度，幾乎不敢使人置信。日外血洗上電局對此報告後，立即委託利益保　國西班牙國代爲調查真相。又美國　湖城最近發生虐待日僑事件，日外務省亦下委託西班牙代爲調查真相中。</p>
<h3>國府宣戰佈告</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明決與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，舊手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完　，乃英美等國仍沒用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，覺勾引渝方分子，參加所謂黃羊戰線，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第爲友邦日本駐海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦喪失，乃益　狡謀。且　視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，且　使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻擾各種　行之推行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方爲根據，向我武漢廣州等處實施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬爲東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以　遂其最後　　之欲，尤爲東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府爲此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之複興，東亞之解放。滿　兩國，夙　友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提議，以期共同建設以道議爲基礎之東亞新秩序，總議諸友邦，數年以來，在本文與英美勢力週旋。　獲勝利之光榮，我國今日茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當知此爲實現，國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之複興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之獲得，胥　於此。其一德一心，　力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>
<p>中華民國三十二年一月九日　主席　汪兆銘</p>
<h3>渝美間將起重大齟齬</h3>
<p>湖南前線日軍某基地八日中央社電　渝軍失陷衡陽，重慶不得不承認進入「暗黑時代」此次湖南戰爭對渝美關係有重大影響。又湘豫區渝軍反攻崩潰與駐渝美根據地之　滅，已使美由大陸進攻日本之計劃完全失敗，洛陽，長沙、衡陽一線，已威協重慶，美國援渝方針當然受阻，假定美國將來依然繼續援渝，其目的僅爲㈠防止渝方脫離反軸心戰線。㈡以渝方爲傀儡離持　其侵犯東亞之橋頭堡，當美國總統華萊士抵渝時，謂餘今次業渝，由後門之西北地區而來，然餘戰聲明，餘實由新的正門進也，肺腑之言，表示何意，無人不知，日軍湖南作戰節節順利進展，因美國特以華萊士赴渝調整美渝關係，將來如何發展，吾人當隔河觀望之。</p>
<p>湖南前線日軍某基軍前進基地衡陽飛機場，地八日中央社電　　渝美空被日軍佔領，實予渝美陣驚莫大影響，蓋渝美間將因此發生重大齟齬，故衡陽飛機場陷落之時，敵陣營內之狼狽情形，實可憐而複可笑，由此亦可知此事給與渝美陣營今後之影響如何巨大矣。</p>
<p>資源地喪失遭致命打擊</p>
<p>綜合前線情報與渝美之廣播，當二十九日日軍佔領衡陽飛機場時，重慶合衆社電稱：「由於衡陽繼洛陽，長沙之後爲日軍所掌握，抗戰區域被拆分爲二，中國最大資源地抗戰力之培簽基地湘贛兩省之喪失，誠爲致使之打擊」。又此對前後之美國廣播稱：「反軸心國今已喪失最大希望空變日本本土之基地矣，同時重慶則喪失更大，換言之，將成抗戰力根　之物與地方，較此更重要之世界之心矣」。此處所謂「世界之心」，關係　指美國對　　之　用心，重慶　之，誠有芒刺在背之極，重慶對此祇　得由「軍事委員會」發言人作即「衡陽陷落亦不停止抗戰」之老生常談，然言猶在耳，衡陽機場防守未及半日，即告失守，　提代美國攻擊重慶之極好資料，信用之失去，固不待言。過去美國已言明渝軍爲「惡劣之軍隊」，今必更變本加厲，想言相向蓋屬當然，有益於此問題，衡陽陷落爲推卸責任計，雙方均未言及，然一至當發生，我人試自以待其醜劇可也。</p>
<p>經濟問題爲間隙之主因</p>
<p>其次，爲無論在重慶抑或美國，均屬重要課題之西南封鎖問題，最近也祥熙曾接見記者團，亦承認衡陽之陷落爲「對外關係最重要之經濟地帶之喪失，誠屬　　」，此係指對美貸款　　之西南　　等主要　物，與在西南之莫大出於　美國資本之工廠而言，現時重慶經濟抗戰力之最大支柄，爲對美借款與美國工廠，重慶過去曾以桐油　與　　爲擔保，得美資一億萬金元，更締結九十九年採礦條約，成立五〇〇〇〇萬金元之法幣安定資金及其他貸款。一九四一年一月締結該約時，「法幣平衡委員會」之美國方面委員受啓　限佛克斯，曾偕重慶「貿易委員會」主席陳光甫同行，調查湘贛兩省之資源，由此事實，亦可知借款對象物之大部份在於此次日軍作戰區域之內。調查後又決定得勝萍鄉煤廳，茲已爲日軍所佔用，火力發電設置，開採重要礦鐵「錫銻」　設施，於湘省新化西北之荒田，重慶及郝陽等地，其他之工廠，僅衡陽一地，已有福特資本係　之第六汽車工廠及軍需民用之大小工廠等二十餘家，而隨在渝美空軍於湖南活後，於衡陽乃有航空工廠每一飛機修理工廠，於其他數處設有修理　構造工廠等。西南半壁需，已有成爲一大美　軍地工廠地帶之觀，且資源山帶與工廠地帶俱以衡陽爲足以，而於東西南北連絡鐵路公　及水路綱，關於此次重要地帶以及與此有相當磁係之交通綱，或於日軍之手或　封鎖。渝美之狼狽，概可　像。</p>
<p>美伸展魔手渝深感苦悶</p>
<p>關於此美方僅有紐約電稱：「各中國西南之財産物，遭遇變故時，我人必須在大陸覓求替代」，此爲重慶方面所深爲苦惱之一點，　所謂其代替，顯指四川省及西北內地，美國之魔手今後當然將更伸展至上列二地，重慶是否將傾其所有　美國之私慾，繼行其住在美國之屈辱的領事外力抗戰，當爲值得注意之問題。重慶似乎已苦惱因戰敗而起之對美關係，故以衡陽飛機場之失陷爲契機，渝美　軍事關係　不待　，即其他方面亦必構成巨大之動搖與間頃，斷然無疑。</p>

<h3>敵美機一架　昨晨侵襲本市　在浦江投彈損失輕微</h3>
<p>日軍在中國大陸作戰，益見進展，在渝敵美空軍現正採取其游擊作戰，昨（八）日侵晨四時五十五分，有敵機一架，侵入上海地區，在實浦江上空，盲目投彈後，怱怱竄逃，關於此事，日陸海軍防空司令部於當日上午六時公布稱：「八日上午四時五十五分，敵美B24型飛機一架，侵入上海地區，在黃浦江上空投彈，損失輕微。」</p>
<p>本市發出　兩次警報</p>

<h3>Commentary: Impressions of the Sixth Consultative Meeting</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>——The Issue of Establishing Model Districts in the Seven Counties of Shanghai Municipality——</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Consultative Committee held its sixth meeting the other day. I participated in it and had the opportunity to hear the discussions and reports from the heads of various municipal departments, as well as the opinions of my colleagues on various aspects of municipal administration. I have benefited greatly. Now, I will express my impressions as follows:</p>
<p>Among the proposals discussed at this meeting, the most important was the suggestion from the Consultative Committee regarding the establishment of model districts in the seven counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality. The content of the proposal largely coincided with the suggestions provided in our newspaper's editorial on July 28. However, to further explain, the Ministry of Interior recently designated Nanhui County as an experimental model county, while the Consultative Committee proposed that all seven counties of Shanghai Municipality should become model counties. Because the seven counties are the outer ring of Shanghai, it is actually impossible for only one of them to become a model county. Even if one county became a model county, it would not have the overall effect on the periphery and would not greatly benefit the entire Shanghai municipal administration. Moreover, the current so-called model county is merely the reform of county administration, restoring the county administration to its proper functions, and making it operate normally. It is still far from being a "model".</p>
<p>Our newspaper's editorial stated that the establishment of a model county must involve four points: First, establishing the administrative system of each county district. Second, improving the administrative personnel of each county district. Third, reorganizing the financial revenue and expenditure of each county. Fourth, maintaining the public security of each county district. Among these, the selection of county magistrates is the most important. Without outstanding talent to serve as county magistrates, all perfect systems and reorganization proposals will become mere formalities, without any practical effect. Currently, most counties in the occupied areas have special circumstances and harsh environments. To be honest, outstanding talents who take office as county magistrates cannot settle in their positions and must overcome special forces to gain a foothold. Furthermore, a few local scoundrels or those fluent in Japanese, those who are clever or obscured by the Japanese authorities, are extremely pushy and surprising. Once they take office, they act recklessly and without shame. These kinds of people, as Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida analyzed, are the second type of pro-Japanese, who have no concept of nation or people, and are neither for China nor for Japan, but only for their own personal gain. To expect such people to promote county administration and improve the lives of the people is naturally to go in the opposite direction. Therefore, we do not advocate model counties unless we are cautious in selecting county magistrates. The seven counties of Shanghai have a crucial relationship with the entire Shanghai. If we want Shanghai to become a national model area for governance, we must first make the seven counties model districts and start by being cautious in selecting the magistrates of the seven counties. We must absolutely adopt meritocracy, without being constrained or interfered with by any party. Furthermore, we hope that the authorities in various Allied countries will assist in selecting good people to appoint as county magistrates. The mayor immediately accepted this suggestion from the Consultative Committee. We believe it is advisable to implement the plan as soon as possible, organize a committee to discuss the implementation steps and various countermeasures, in order to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mayor Chen, in his opening remarks at the meeting, fervently expounded on the importance of personnel. The saying "everyone has nothing to do, and nothing gets done" can be said to hit the nail on the head when it comes to the chronic problem of Chinese civil servants. Mayor Chen also pointed out that in general, responsible personnel like to appoint fellow villagers and relatives in their personnel policies. Fellow villagers and relatives are not absolutely unusable, but their talents must be considered. If there is favoritism, thinking that all fellow villagers and relatives are usable, the result will naturally be "everyone has nothing to do, and nothing gets done." He specifically instructed all responsible authorities to pay attention to this. He also indicated that the renewal of the civil service system will begin in Shanghai.</p>
<p>In summary, the issue of personnel has held a dominant position in Chinese political history. Sound personnel leads to prosperous politics, while unsound personnel leads to declining politics. Currently, after the turmoil, local politics is abnormal. Without the most sound personnel to handle administration, there is no basis for discussing innovation and progress.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's Broadcast: Grasp Victory with Total Effort, Establish Human Morality, and Resolutely Defeat the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The gist of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's broadcast is as follows: The world war situation has now entered an unprecedented great war, and it is also a time when Japan is facing unprecedented difficulties. At this juncture, I am cooperating with Admiral Yonai of the Navy to form a cabinet, and we will sincerely work with the people to overcome national difficulties. I am filled with fear. Shortly after taking office, on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I would like to express my thoughts in response to the sacred pronouncements. Since the outbreak of the war, it has been two years and nine months. Due to deep suffering and pressure from internal and external situations, the enemy intends to determine victory or defeat in a short period of time and has invaded the Mariana Islands, with the momentum to break into our homeland in one fell swoop. At the same time, they are also slowly advancing in New Guinea, attempting to sever our homeland's transportation to the South Seas. At this time, our Japanese army has been approaching and fighting bravely, and a hundred million people in the rear are concentrating their total strength to crush the enemy's ambitions. I take this opportunity to pledge my allegiance to the Imperial Edict and to recognize with the people the ultimate goal of this Greater East Asia War, and to strengthen our belief in certain victory. Judging from the current situation, even if the enemy's air force is prevented from invading our homeland, the conclusion is extremely simple. That is, according to the Divine Edicts proclaimed by our ancestors and the instructions in the Great Edicts, we must gather all our strength and eliminate all obstacles to grasp victory. The path to grasping victory, as shown in the Great Edict, is that we, the subjects, absolutely believe in the great achievements of the Emperor, each fulfilling his duties and carrying out his mission. We are confident that with this belief, and with a hundred million hearts united in total strength, the result will be the power to penetrate the universe, supporting the boundless imperial destiny and achieving complete victory, leading the imperial country to stand on eternal bedrock. When military officers and civilians unite to fulfill their respective missions, they will naturally establish the highest morality of mankind, and the power to resolutely defeat the enemy will also arise. At this time when the Greater East Asia War can achieve a sharp victory, I am convinced that this is the essence of the belief in certain victory. I would like to share this with the people. Moreover, the government has implemented all measures to move towards victory, which goes without saying. The recently established Supreme War Guidance Council is also working hard to rapidly enhance military power and stabilize the people's livelihood. To reiterate, the time has come for the imperial army to fight bravely, for a hundred million people in the rear to be fully armed, to concentrate total strength, and to crush the enemy's ambitions. Today is the only major battle to repay the Emperor's kindness, and I am convinced that it is the best opportunity for a hundred million people. If we miss it today, it will not come again.</p>
<h3>The Hunan War Situation Enters a New Stage: Japanese Troops Occupied Hengyang Yesterday, Completing the Deployment to Annihilate the Anti-Axis Forces</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 8th: The Japanese troops that had previously surrounded Hengyang launched a general offensive on the evening of August 4. They annihilated three divisions of the Chongqing army co-defending the city with the U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, and completely occupied the city at 8:00 AM on the 8th.</p>
<p>Hunan, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing-U.S. air base in Hengyang has been captured by the Japanese army. The Hunan war situation has therefore entered a decisive phase, and the mainland front has taken on a new shape and entered a new stage. This operation is fundamentally different from the so-called mainland operations of the past. The Japanese army launched an offensive with a major determination. Even if we view the Henan and Hunan operations separately, we can see how grand its scale and plan are. It can be said to be the largest operation in the past seven years. With the strategic strongholds of the Chongqing army, with the east-west defense lines as the outer ring, double encirclement, annihilating the main force of the Chongqing army, and as a result, connecting the Jinghan Railway, the artery of North and Central China, it has become a new front for the offensive against Chongqing. With Hengyang as the apex, and Xinfeng in Jiangxi Province, and Wuzhou and Liuzhou in Guangxi Province as the base, the Chongqing-U.S. air base has also suffered a major threat. At the same time, ensuring the gateway to the Chuan-Xiang Highway, Xiangtan, the gateway to the noble Sichuan, has been opened wide. In both operations, the Japanese army was disciplined and clearly recognized the correct goal of the Greater East Asia War, promoting the friendly relations between China and Japan. The Japanese army is now operating across a broad area of seven hundred kilometers north and south of the Yangtze River. The entire war situation has entered a new stage, completing the deployment to annihilate the anti-Axis forces. The decisive battle between Japan, the United States, and Britain on the mainland front has officially begun.</p>
<p>Japanese Base, 8th (Central News Agency) - The significance of the Japanese army's capture of Hengyang this time does not lie in the acquisition of the city, but in the acquisition of the Chongqing-Hankou air base airfield. This place is an indispensable air force stronghold for the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. After the 14th Air Force Detachment in Chongqing became independent in March of last year, it became the operational base for Chongqing to disturb Central China. The air raids on the Wuhan area, the attacks on ships on the Yangtze River, and the destruction of the Yuehan Railway between Wuchang and Yuezhou were all based in Hengyang. Even more, the enemy attracted the Japanese air power to Hengyang, taking advantage of this gap to carry out bombings of the Japanese homeland. Since the thirty-second year, air battles have been constantly unfolding in various places. The Japanese air force also inflicted heavy blows on the airfields in Guilin, Hengyang, and Lingling. In the past three years, two hundred air battles have occurred over Hengyang. However, the Japanese aircraft have always been dominant. As of today, more than two hundred enemy aircraft have been shot down or destroyed and set on fire in the skies over Hengyang. Now that Hengyang has been captured by the Japanese army, the U.S. Air Force abandoned Hengyang when Changsha fell and withdrew its air force to the Guilin-Lingling area. Therefore, the loss of Hengyang has undoubtedly made the enemy fear the loss of all airfields in the Xiang-Gan area.</p>
<p>Hengyang Japanese Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army entered the streets of Hengyang, the Chongqing army in the city lost its will to fight. By dawn on the 8th, the commander of the 10th Army of the Chongqing army, Fang Xianjue, and his chief of staff, Cai Yuqi, the commander of the 3rd Division, Zhou Qingrou, the commander of the 190th Division, Yang Youlue, the acting commander of the Reserve 10th Division, Li Fuzhong, and the commander of the 54th Division, Rao Shaowei, and other top commanders of the Chongqing army in the city immediately raised the white flag. Li's unit surrendered to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 7th that it had acknowledged that Japanese troops had entered the northern part of Hengyang. Japanese reinforcements were continuously arriving from the Xiangtan Mountain area, and under the cover of intense artillery fire, they fiercely attacked the front-line positions inside and outside Hengyang, engaging in bloody battles with the Chongqing defenders in the city. By the morning of the 6th, part of the Japanese army had broken through the northern positions of Hengyang. At the same time, another part of the Japanese army was engaged in a fierce general assault with the Chongqing army positions in the southwestern outskirts of the city around the highlands, unfolding a magnificent battle for control. In addition, in Lianhua, Chaling, Leiyang, Anren, and the southern part of Xiangxiang, fighting is also taking place. Outside the city of Lianjiang in Guangdong and in the southwestern part of the county, fierce fighting is also underway.</p>
<p>Hunan Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in the Leiyang area has been continuing to engage in rescue operations since late July to aid Hengyang. Surrounded by the Japanese army on a regular basis, fierce bayonet battles are still raging. The Chongqing 26th, 99th, and Provisional 3rd Armies, among others, in order to rescue Hengyang, are attacking the Japanese army near Xiaoshui Pu, eight kilometers south of Leiyang. The Japanese army had defeated the Chongqing army's vanguard near Wulipu (two kilometers northwest of Leiyang) on a regular basis and surrounded them from three sides. On the night of the 5th, part of the Japanese army crossed the Ji River, made a surprise attack on the rear of the Chongqing army, cut off their retreat, and launched an attack from all sides. Therefore, the three armies of the Chongqing army are in a critical situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Enter Hengyang: Military Discipline Is Strict, and a Proclamation Is Issued to Protect Good Residents</h3>
<p>Hunan Japanese Frontline, 8th (Central News Agency) - The motive of the Allied forces in launching the Hunan operation this time is purely based on breaking the common enemy of the Anglo-Americans and their vassal forces, who have been sacrificing China and invading East Asia for a century. Since the launch, in no time, the important military strongholds of the province, Changsha, Yueyang, Xiangtan, Liling, Liuyang, and other places fell one after another. Now Hengyang, located at the intersection of the Yuehan and Xiang-Gui railways, was captured easily on August 8. At this point, the Hunan operation has entered another stage due to the capture of Hengyang. This time, the Allied forces entered Hengyang with strict military discipline, not violating the slightest thing. They did their utmost to protect the good people. Their operation was aimed solely at crushing the vassal forces of the Anglo-Americans who were sacrificing China. The vast majority of the people are powerful partners within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, in addition to sternly warning the soldiers to absolutely prohibit all illegal acts such as harassing the villagers, they also issued a proclamation to the people in the territory, telling them not to be alarmed, to go about their business, and further guaranteeing the lives, property, and all other natural rights of the people. There will be no levy of donations or conscription in the garrison area. They also absolutely respect the customs of the various villages. Therefore, the people were overjoyed when they heard the news and came to submit, looking forward to the beautiful life of peace and prosperity. The original text of the proclamation is recorded below: "Proclamation: The purpose of the Japanese army's entry into this area this time is to break the traditional ambition of the Anglo-Americans to sacrifice China and invade East Asia, to assist China, to establish sovereignty, to achieve freedom, and to promote and realize the friendly relations between China and Japan. Where the righteous army goes, it must conquer, defeat the Anglo-Americans and their vassal forces, implement security and peace for the people, and ensure that the residents live and work in peace and contentment. Do not believe rumors and frighten each other. The following points are made clear so that the great righteousness of our army may be understood: 1. The Japanese army will temporarily garrison the area until security and peace for the people are fully realized. 2. The Japanese army guarantees the lives and all other natural rights of the people in the garrison area. 3. There will be no levy of donations or conscription in the Japanese army's garrison area. All residents in the area who cooperate with our army and provide materials or labor will be paid a sufficient reward. 4. The Japanese army recognizes the simultaneous circulation of the banknotes and central reserve certificates issued in the garrison area. 5. The Japanese army respects the customs of the villages and assists the Chinese in implementing a system of self-government. However, the Japanese army will temporarily implement military administration until security and stability are achieved. This proclamation is hereby made known to all the people in this area, so that they may all understand it and not violate the spirit of the righteous army. Be sure to heed this proclamation."</p>

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Investigates: American Soldiers' Bestial Acts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - American soldiers used the skulls of Japanese soldiers killed on the Pacific front to make souvenirs and send them back to their home country for amusement. U.S. congressmen even made paper knives from the arm bones of Japanese soldiers and presented them to the President. The shocking nature of these barbaric and bestial acts is almost unbelievable. After the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported this to the government, it immediately entrusted the Spanish State, which protects interests, to investigate the truth. In addition, an incident of abuse of Japanese expatriates recently occurred in Lake City, USA. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also entrusted Spain to investigate the truth.</p>
<h3>National Government's Declaration of War</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the 30th year [likely referring to the Republic of China calendar], the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan. Since then, it has engaged in the Old Hand New National Movement, dedicated to ensuring security, improving people's livelihoods, increasing national strength, and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still clung to their century-old policy of dividing East Asia and intensified their efforts, inciting Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Asian battlefield, sending troops to Burma and India, using East Asians to kill East Asians. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the naval and air forces of friendly nation Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning and regard the peaceful development of the areas ruled by the National Government. They allow Chongqing elements to constantly harass us, obstructing the implementation of various policies, and directly use their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The Chongqing elements, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, are shamefully acting as traitors to East Asia. Britain and the United States, with ulterior motives towards East Asia, have exhausted their efforts to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate aggressive desires, which should be met with common hatred by the East Asian nations. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will exert all its strength to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. Manchuria and Japan have always been friendly and share the same spirit when it comes to Asian co-prosperity. In the future, they will further promote proposals to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Many friendly nations have been fighting the forces of Britain and the United States for many years and have won glorious victories. Our country is now joining the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Grand Asianism of the Founding Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of universal faith, peace, and harmony all depend on this. Let us be of one mind and one heart and devote our strength to the end to carry out this great mission of a great era!</p>
<p>January 9th of the 32nd year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Significant Discord to Arise Between Chongqing and the US</h3>
<p>An Eight-Day Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Hunan Front: The Chongqing army's loss of Hengyang forces Chongqing to acknowledge entering a "dark age." This Hunan campaign has a significant impact on relations between Chongqing and the US. Moreover, the collapse of the Chongqing army's counteroffensive in the Xiang-Yu area, along with the destruction of the US bases stationed in Chongqing, has completely foiled the US plan to invade Japan from the mainland. With the Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang line threatening Chongqing, US aid to Chongqing will naturally be hampered. Assuming the US continues to aid Chongqing in the future, its purpose will be solely for: (1) preventing Chongqing from leaving the anti-Axis front; (2) using Chongqing as a puppet to maintain its bridgehead for invading East Asia. When US President Wallace arrived in Chongqing, he said, "I have come to Chongqing this time, from the northwest region through the back door, but I solemnly declare that I am actually entering through a new front door." Everyone understands what the heartfelt words express. As the Japanese army's Hunan campaign progresses smoothly, the US specifically dispatched Wallace to Chongqing to adjust US-Chongqing relations. We should observe how things develop from across the river.</p>
<p>Eight-Day Central News Agency dispatch from a forward Japanese base in Hunan, the Hengyang Airfield: The US-Chongqing airfields being captured by the Japanese army has had an enormous impact on the US-Chongqing camp. Major discord will arise between Chongqing and the US as a result. The pathetic and laughable state of the enemy camp when the Hengyang Airfield fell is truly evident. From this, we can also see how huge the impact of this event will be on the US-Chongqing camp in the future.</p>
<p>Fatal Blow from Loss of Resource Areas</p>
<p>Based on combined frontline intelligence and broadcasts from Chongqing and the US, when the Japanese army captured the Hengyang Airfield on the 29th, a Chongqing Associated Press dispatch stated: "With Hengyang, following Luoyang and Changsha, being seized by the Japanese army, the War of Resistance area is divided into two. The loss of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, China's largest resource areas and the base for cultivating the strength of the War of Resistance, is truly a fatal blow." Furthermore, a subsequent US broadcast stated: "The anti-Axis nations have now lost the largest hope of launching air strikes against the Japanese mainland. At the same time, Chongqing has lost even more. In other words, it will become the root and source of the strength of the War of Resistance, more important than the heart of the world." The so-called "heart of the world" refers to the US's intentions toward Chongqing. Chongqing is truly feeling like it has thorns in its back. Chongqing could only respond with the old cliché from the "Military Commission" spokesperson: "The fall of Hengyang will not stop the War of Resistance." However, even as the words were still ringing in the ears, the Hengyang Airfield was lost in less than half a day, providing excellent material for the Japanese to attack Chongqing. The loss of credibility goes without saying. In the past, the US had already stated that the Chongqing army was an "inferior army." Now, it will surely intensify its criticism. It is only natural to imagine them confronting each other. Regarding this issue, both sides have remained silent to avoid blame for the fall of Hengyang. However, once it occurs, we can simply wait and see the ugly drama unfold.</p>
<p>Economic Issues as the Primary Cause of Friction</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of the southwestern blockade, which is an important topic in both Chongqing and the US. Recently, H.H. Kung also met with a group of reporters and admitted that the fall of Hengyang was a "truly significant loss of the most important economic zone for foreign relations." This refers to major materials for US loans and factories in the southwest that rely heavily on US capital. Currently, the greatest support for Chongqing's economic War of Resistance comes from US loans and US factories. In the past, Chongqing had obtained US capital of one hundred million gold dollars by using tung oil as collateral, and also concluded a 99-year mining treaty, establishing a 500 million gold dollar legal tender stabilization fund and other loans. When the treaty was signed in January 1941, the US member of the "Legal Tender Stabilization Committee," O.K. Davis, accompanied Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Chongqing "Trade Commission," to investigate resources in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. From this fact, it can also be seen that the majority of the collateral objects for the loans were located within the area of this Japanese military operation. After the investigation, it was also decided that the Datong-Pingsiang coal mines, which have now been occupied by the Japanese army, the thermal power generation facilities, the mining of important minerals such as tin and antimony, facilities in Huangtian, northwest of Xinhua in Hunan province, Chongqing, and Hengyang, among other places. In Hengyang alone, there were more than twenty factories, including the Ford-funded Sixth Automobile Factory and large and small factories for military and civilian needs. Following the activity of the US Air Force in Chongqing in Hunan, Hengyang had an aircraft factory and an aircraft repair factory, with repair and construction factories in other locations. The southwestern region had become a major US military-industrial zone, and both the resource zone and the factory zone were centered in Hengyang, with railways and waterways connecting east, west, north, and south. The important zones and the related transportation networks are now either in the hands of the Japanese army or blockaded. The embarrassment of the US and Chongqing can be imagined.</p>
<p>US Extends its Grasp, Chongqing Feels Anguish</p>
<p>Regarding this, only a New York dispatch stated: "When the properties in southwestern China encounter changes, we must seek replacements on the mainland." This is a point of deep distress for Chongqing. The so-called replacement clearly refers to Sichuan province and the northwestern inland. The US's grasp will naturally extend even further into the aforementioned two areas in the future. Whether Chongqing will sacrifice everything to satisfy the selfish desires of the US and continue its humiliating War of Resistance under foreign consular power in the US is a matter that deserves attention. Chongqing seems to be suffering from the US relationship resulting from the defeat in the war. Therefore, taking the loss of the Hengyang Airfield as an opportunity, not only will the US-Chongqing military relationship be shaken, but other aspects will also experience a huge upheaval and discord is without a doubt.</p>

<h3>Today is the Eighth Air Defense Day; Air Defense Drills Will Be Held; Attention Must Also Be Paid to Real Alarms</h3>
<p>Today (9th) is the Eighth Air Defense Day. In addition to conducting various air defense propaganda activities as usual, the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters will also hold various air defense drills to ensure that citizens are proficient in various air defense measures and to enhance their air defense spirit, staying at their posts and being prepared for any eventuality. The training items have already been detailed in yesterday's newspaper, and citizens must strictly follow them. However, regarding the alarm drills, the scheduled times for issuing the alerts are: the first time at 9:30 AM, issuing a warning alarm, transitioning to an air raid alarm at 10:30 AM, and lifting the air raid alarm at 11:30 AM; the second time at 8:30 PM, issuing an air raid alarm, lifting the air raid alarm at 9:30 PM, and completely lifting the warning alarm at 10:30 PM. However, in addition to the above-mentioned scheduled training alarms, if there are any further alarm sounds, it is a real air defense alarm, and citizens should pay special attention to taking various emergency measures at any time to defend against enemy aircraft attacks.</p>
<h3>An Enemy Aircraft Attacked Our City Yesterday Morning; Bombing in the Huangpu River Causes Minor Damage</h3>
<p>As the Japanese army's operations in mainland China continue to advance, the US-Chongqing air force is now adopting guerrilla warfare tactics. Yesterday (8th) at 4:55 AM, an enemy aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs indiscriminately over the Huangpu River before fleeing hastily. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters announced at 6:00 AM that morning: "At 4:55 AM on the 8th, an enemy US B-24 aircraft intruded into the Shanghai area and dropped bombs over the Huangpu River, causing minor damage."</p>
<p>The City Issues Two Alarms</p>
<p>The city issued a warning alarm at 11:05 PM on the previous day (7th), which was lifted at 11:35 PM. Then, at 4:55 AM yesterday (8th), an emergency air raid alarm was issued, indicating that an enemy US aircraft was attacking. Because the entire city's lights were extinguished, plunging it into a "black city" state, the enemy US aircraft was unable to find its target and only dropped bombs blindly on the Huangpu River before fleeing suddenly, causing little damage. At 5:45 AM, the air raid alarm was changed to a warning alarm, and at 6:00 AM, the warning alarm was completely lifted, returning the city to normal.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Conducts Psychological Warfare</p>
<p>(Additional report) The enemy aircraft that infiltrated the Shanghai area yesterday morning for a guerrilla air raid had scouted Hangzhou Bay at 11:00 PM on the 7th, then reappeared in the area at 4:00 AM on the 8th. At 4:55 AM, flying at an altitude of about 500 meters, it entered the Pudong area and penetrated into Shanghai, dropping bombs over the Huangpu River before fleeing hastily. The objective of the enemy US air force seemed to be the ships in the Huangpu River, but the bombs landed in the river, causing minimal damage. The US-Chongqing air force has suffered heavy losses due to the brave attacks of the Japanese army. This attack by the enemy forces is nothing more than an attempt to conduct psychological warfare in the Shanghai area. Furthermore, there were shortcomings in the light control aspects during the warning alarm the night before, especially regarding the adjustment of car lights, which needs to be greatly improved. Citizens must pay close attention.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Control Association Holds Its Third Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Today</h3>
<p>The new organizational structure of the National Commercial Control Association has been adjusted and is starting new control activities. In addition to submitting separate letters to government authorities and related groups, the association has scheduled the second third joint meeting of directors and supervisors for 3:00 PM this afternoon (9th) at the Cathay Mansions to discuss all the steps for implementing material controls in the future.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Rationing Resumes Tomorrow; Each Person Can Purchase Two Sheng of Rice with a Coupon</h3>
<p>Regarding the household rice rationing in the city, which has been suspended for two months, under the active supervision of the Municipal Government's Goods Rationing Office, it has been decided that from the 10th of this month, all districts in the city will universally resume sales. Each person, regardless of age, can purchase two city sheng of rice, calculated at 35 yuan per sheng, for a total of 70 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The office originally planned to unify the periods for household rice rationing. However, due to the large number of remaining coupons from the former Economic Affairs Bureau and the former Food Bureau, which would have to be scrapped, it was decided to continue using the past rice rationing periods to conserve resources. The old first district will still be called the 69th period, and areas outside the old first district will be called the 41st period. The former will receive rice based on the comprehensive rationing certificate. At that time, citizens in that district can check the designated number in the office's announcement and purchase rice with the coupon. Other areas that have not yet implemented the comprehensive rationing certificate will purchase rice with the rice purchase certificate issued by the former Food Bureau.</p>
<p>The city currently has a population of 3.3 million people, and each period requires the allocation of approximately 61,000 bags of rice. The whole month requires approximately 183,000 bags of rice, including specially accumulated rationed rice. The inventory of household rice is extremely abundant, and with the imminent harvesting of new grain, the food prospects for the people can be free from worry. The continued implementation of household rice rationing will still be based on past rice rationing standards, with each person, regardless of age, receiving six sheng of rice per month in three installments. Ration coupons will be distributed by the Baojia office. After receiving the coupons, residents can purchase rice from the public sales offices. Currently, the office has six public sales offices responsible for selling specially rationed rice to residents and others.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Drop; Shanghai Citizens' Household Rice Rationing: Through the efforts of both the Japanese military and political sides, a large amount of rice has been transported from Hunan, a newly operational area, to meet the needs of the people of Shanghai. The authorities have decided to resume rationing from the 10th of this month. Rice prices in Shanghai are declining daily, falling to 8,000 yuan on the 8th. It is generally expected that the market price will fall further after rationing is implemented, and rice prices can be stabilized.</p>
<h3>The Fourteenth Period of Household Sugar Will Be Universally Sold Starting Today</h3>
<p>The 14th period of household sugar in the city has been allocated by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Sales Office and approved by the authorities. Universal sales will begin today (9th). Retailers in all districts (including the old First District, Nanshi, Zhabei, Zhabei Six Districts, Xuhuafang, Longcaozhen, the city center, Pudong South, and Pudong North) should begin selling on August 9th based on the certificate. The valid period for purchasing sugar in this period is until August 18th, after which it will expire. In districts formerly under the jurisdiction of the Food Bureau, purchases will be made with the 15th period sugar purchase certificate. Each sugar purchase certificate allows the purchase of five city liang of crude granulated sugar or refined white sugar, priced at 26 yuan and 2 jiao in national currency. This includes the cost of the sugar purchase certificate paper. Retail donations are exempt. Households purchasing sugar must bring their own containers; additional fees will be charged for packaging. All retail stores must operate in accordance with the regulations and must not reduce the quantity, illegally raise prices, or conceal adulterated goods. Reader's Aid Message</p>
<h3>Approved List of Aid Recipients to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The examination papers for the seventh session of the newspaper's reader's scholarship application have now been graded separately. All those with better results and scores that meet the standards are admitted, accounting for about half of the total number of more than 7,000 people. All 10 million yuan of scholarships will be issued to admitted students, with an average of 3,000 yuan per person. Among the more than 3,000 people who were not selected, there are many who are excellent in their studies, talented, physically fit, and morally upright, and should be selected to enable them to continue their studies for further development. Unfortunately, due to the limited scholarship funds, we are unable to help! We hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will donate as much as they can. An additional 30,000 yuan will help 10 more people to study, and an additional 300,000 yuan will help 100 more people to study. In other words, more donations will help more people, and the more donated, the more beneficiaries there will be. The colleagues of this newspaper will do their best to help needy students to the greatest extent possible; we especially hope that the readers of this newspaper will also fulfill their greatest aspirations; we sincerely pray! As for the list of students approved for scholarships, a total of more than 2,700 people from elementary school to junior high school will be published in this newspaper tomorrow (10th). The remaining high school, vocational school, and university levels will be announced later. We hope that all students will pay special attention.</p>

We will settle accounts on a daily basis and submit the funds successively, which is more convenient. The total revenue of the entire business today is 100,000 yuan, and 5%, or 5,000 yuan, should be extracted, sending 2,500 yuan to your newspaper and Xinwen Daily, respectively. Please accept."</p>

It is hoped that all designated retailers will operate in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Municipal Consultative Council Holds Sixth Committee Meeting; Two Proposals Approved</h3>
<p>The Municipal Consultative Council held its sixth plenary committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 7th of this month in the Municipal Government meeting room on Jiangxi Road. Mayor Chen, Secretary-General Wu, and the heads of various bureaus and departments, as well as committee members Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Riping, Pei Yunqing, Jin Xiongbai, Li Quanshi, Wu Yunsu, Xiang Kangyuan, Guo Shun, Shen Siliang, Yao Qingsan, Chen Binhe, etc. attended.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>The meeting began with a speech by Mayor Chen, who briefly stated that the municipal administration was unified on August 1st, and he had published an article on all the circumstances. In terms of the newly divided district boundaries, it can be said that they are the most suitable for the current situation and the future of the municipal administration in the ideal state, and it is expected that there will be no further changes in the future. He felt that personnel issues were particularly important, and he hoped that all parties would break with old habits, eliminate prejudices, work together harmoniously, and cooperate. All regulations on staff service are being revised. As for the selection of staff, he had always respected the freedom of each unit to select them, and he hoped that each unit would strive to review, consult widely, and focus entirely on talent, and he also hoped that the Consultative Council would provide guidance at any time.</p>
<p>Two Proposals</p>
<p>The Consultative Council then discussed two proposals: (1) A proposal to establish the seven counties under the jurisdiction of the city as model districts. (2) A proposal to incorporate the significance of receiving the concessions and abolishing unequal treaties on August 1st into textbooks, which were unanimously passed. Subsequently, the Deputy Director of the Police Bureau reported on the suburban police facilities plan, and Director Feng of the Goods Rationing Office reported on the preparations for this rice rationing, both in great detail. Regarding household rice, it was decided that from August, two sheng would be rationed per person each period, which would not be lacking or delayed. However, the first phase of August would have to start on the 10th due to procedural reasons. As for rice registration, it is hoped that citizens will report truthfully and not purchase extra, so it is hoped that they will not conceal anything. This matter concerns the livelihood of the people, and statistics will have to be verified on the ground in the future.</p>
<p>Financial Issues</p>

<h3>Baojia Propaganda Committee Holds First Preparatory Meeting</h3>
<p>In order to cooperate with the Baojia propaganda work, the news industry in the city launched the organization of the Baojia Propaganda Committee, and held the first preparatory meeting at the 工商聯誼會 at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Director of the Propaganda Department Liang Xiuyu, and representatives from various newspapers: Chen Binhe, Xu Liqu, Lu Feng, Lu Guangjie, Zhu Yongkang, Chu Baowei, Ren Yunpeng, Shen Yanshan, etc. Director of the Baojia Department Gu Jiwu also attended in person. Director Liang first delivered a speech, briefly outlining the significance of organizing the Baojia Propaganda Committee, and strongly urged news colleagues in the city to enthusiastically participate in the Baojia propaganda work. Director Gu then gave a speech, stating that although the Baojia Department had been established for many years, the general public still did not fully understand the Baojia work. Therefore, he hoped that the Propaganda Committee would be established as soon as possible, and hoped that colleagues participating in the work would cooperate to enable the public to generally understand the meaning of Baojia, etc. After the speech, the representatives immediately nominated Chen Binhe, Xu Liqu, Lu Feng, Lu Guangjie, Zhu Yongkang, Hinohara Kiyomaro, Zheng Hongyan, Chen Zhengzhang, Ma Zongyao, Chu Baowei, Ren Yunpeng, and Pan Bide as committee members, and elected Chen Binhe as chairman. It was agreed to hold an inaugural meeting in the near future, compile propaganda branches in various districts of the city, and actively promote Baojia propaganda.</p>
<h3>Finance and Industry Ministries Dispatch Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate the Stock Exchange Books</h3>
<p>During the period of skyrocketing Chinese stock prices, the Chinese Stock Exchange's announcement on the 31st of last month to suspend trading for one day to handle deliveries attracted attention from the outside world. Li Shangming, a member of the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervision Committee, felt that the exchange's sudden suspension of trading for one day during the period of rising prices gave speculators an opportunity to make up for their short positions, and the measures were improper. He sent a telegram to the ministers of the Finance and Industry Ministries and the chairman of the Supervisory Committee, Chen, for instructions. It is now known that after approving the telegram, the Finance and Industry Ministries separately ordered Mai Jingming, Director of the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and Li Zheng, Commissioner of the Finance Ministry's Shanghai Office, to work with Zhang Guru, Director of the Inspection Team of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, to go to the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange on Jiujiang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (8th) to inspect the exchange's business accounts to see if there was any collusion to speculate in short positions. It is reported that the chairman of the exchange, Zhang Weiru, and the managing director, Shen Changgeng, personally met with them yesterday and presented the trading books for the past month for inspection. This inspection of the accounts was very serious and meticulous and will take one or two days to complete.</p>
