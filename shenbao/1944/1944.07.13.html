<h3 id="c1">先制和集中 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐在六日工商聯誼會座談會席上說，日本的戰略在先制和集中，先制是先發制人，集中是集中全力。這雖是戰略上的話，可是同樣可以應用到人生的一切。在大時代裏面，整個世界在戰鬥中，全世界的人類生活都在緊張奮鬥中，先制和集中更是任何人的座右銘。</p>
<p>兵法上說，先發者制人，後發者制於人，所以先制就是主動。凡是能够把握着主動地位的，可以和，可以戰，可以攻，可以守，一切行動完全取決於自己，他不受人家的指使，利用，挑撥，他不做被動的應付。他只是主動的，憑着本身的思想，學問，經騐，決定他所應當說的，應當做的，把握時間，毅然地立即實行，不躊躇，不畏縮，勇往直前。怎樣才能取得主動的地位呢？第一在乎平時的刻苦準備，第二在乎臨時的決心和毅力。猶之下棋，平時研究有素的高手，上塲胸中先有成竹，數子旣落，局勢已成，就依照預定方針，着着佔先，使對手顧此失彼，無從應付·俗語所謂「先着」，又云「一着之錯，全盤之失」，因為一失主動的地位，處處都是被動，也就失了取勝的機會了。</p>
<p>先制固然在戰塲上說，是一種策略，可是應用這個策略，需要平時的極大的實力做後盾。所以先制不是技巧。先制是實力的表現。這次大東亞戰爭就是一個顯明的例，在盟邦日本決定和美國交涉而決定作戰的時候，全力從事於交涉。在無法進行交涉而決定作戰的時候，就立即宣佈作戰。在宣佈作戰的時候，就決定作戰的方法，毅然決然的執行，使敵人措手不及。戰塲行動，瞬息萬變，可以攻則攻，可以守則守，某處取攻勢，某處取守勢，都早在計劃之中。因為盟邦日本平時有準備，臨時有毅力，所以處處是主動，處處是先着，處處是實力的表現。</p>
<p>因為先制是實力的表現，所以先發制人和集中全力更有聯合的密切關係。能够先發制人的然後能够取得最後的勝利。力量的分散是戰塲上的大忌，我們看二年餘的大東亞戰局，盟邦日本的勝利，英美的失敗，根本的原因就在力量的集中和分散這一點上。</p>
<p>戰局變幻不定，而戰塲原則始終不變，能够取得主動地位的，能够集中全力的，當然能够勝利，這是大勢所趨，無可置疑的了。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日空軍冒雨出動再襲密芝那機塲　空戰中並擊落敵機十一架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>緬甸前綫十二日中央社電　緬甸戰綫日戰鬥機隊，為協力陸上部艦作戰，連日冒雨出動，九日下午再度大舉急襲密芝那機塲，於猛烈之敵立砲火中，投彈炸機塲附近軍事設施，並與哨戒上空之敵P40戰鬥機交戰，擊落五架，（一架未證實）。其後，於密芝那西南五十公里上空，又發現B25十架及援護該隊之P51十一架，展開壯烈空戰，擊落其B25二架，P51四架（內一架未證實），是役日機三架未歸還。</p>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電　緬北日軍十日晚曾對巴活克附近（富貢南摩加恩西十公里）恃有迫擊砲陣地繼續頑抗之敵軍實行夜襲，當即展開肉搏戰，卒使數倍於日軍之敵呈大混亂，是役敵軍損失已確認者計遺屍五十四具。又該處敵軍自九日以後。曾遂次將兵力集結於巴活克附近，構築山砲陣地，為此，日軍乃以先發制人之手段，直迫在那姆加恩河渡河中之敵軍，使其一部受重大打擊，並在河岸擊退其主力，是役，計載獲捷克機關槍及其他軍器甚夥，使敵之反擊行動消滅於未然。</p>

<h3 id="c4">日本大本營發表　最近空軍戰果　渝美機受重大打擊 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十二日社電　日本大本營七月十二日下午三時發表，中國方面日空軍部隊，連日襲美在華空軍基地，現仍續行中。茲誌七月三日至十一日所收戰果如次：擊落十一架（內兩架未證實，）擊毀及燒毀九十五架，以上期間內，日空軍自炸未歸者七架。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　日軍在中國襲綫，發動之攻勢，進展極為順利。於河南戰綫，重創渝第一戰區殘軍，及由第八戰區來採之胡宗南軍，於湖南戰綫攻取衡陽機塲後，以一部兵力，攻擊衡陽，以主力繼續向渝戰區心臟部着着推進。廣東方面日軍，更沿粵漢綫北上，破陣陷城，繼續猛進。同時中國方面日軍航空部隊，亦呼應陸戰之節節進展，連日活躍，收獲赫赫戰果。計十日奇襲桂林機塲內之二十八架飛機，悉被炸毀，使其起火。十一日攻襲丹竹，該機塲中之十數架飛機被炸毀六架，並使其起火。總計三日至十一日之九日間，擊落渝美機十一架（內兩架不確），擊毀及被炸焚燒者九十五架。又六月一月中，共擊落擊毀及被炸焚燒者之敵機為二百餘架，加上近日發表之七月上旬之戰果，則四十餘日來，渝美空軍喪失飛機達三百零六架之多。日軍空陸兩軍之協力活躍，可謂已予渝美空軍以致命之打擊云。</p>
<p>日機轟炸桂林機塲</p>
<p>日軍某基地十一日中央社電　空襲桂林機塲時，渝軍使用全部高射砲射擊，並以戰關機挑戰，日轟炸機隊發揮無畏精神，飛行甚低，轟炸目的物，在此一戰，日某大尉乘機尾部中炸彈二發，松本軍曹乘機機身亦中一彈，然未被擊落，全體安返原地。據轟炸隊員依田曹長談，是晚天空月明星稀，市內實施燈火管制，未見一燈。機塲在桂林市街西方十七公里地點，因月光照明，機塲情形歷歷可見，作領導諸機描準停留地上之敵機投下炸彈，此時機塲北端高射砲及機關槍，一齊開火抵抗，余即速轉機身，升空脫離砲火云云。又河內曹長談，市街中心有一大廈，余記得此係美國領事署，市街周因公路四通八達，軍用工廠等大建築物，散在其間。楊隊經過市街而達機塲，施行轟炸投彈後，正欲升上時，小砲彈二發中余機尾部，然未受大傷，仍歸還基地。又松本軍曹談，索聞桂林侮航空要塞，其防空砲火，甚為猛烈，余之機投彈後，被十五十六等高射機關砲射擊，機身周圍不絕有火彈爆發，歸還基地後，發見機身中彈，然機員全部平安無傷。</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地十二日中央社電　日軍轟炸機隊，於十一日下午三時，曾轟炸廣西省丹竹機塲，當時塲內停有「P五十一」型十數架，即被炸碎六架，以上日機並反覆掃射兵舍，及軍事設施，均予以重創，日機則全部安返基地。</p>
<p>在華日軍前綫某基地十二日中央社電　敵美空軍P41型六架，十一日上午八時半，企圖侵入廣州上空，日軍戰鬥機隊，當即邀擊，在盧苞（廣州西北五十公里）附近，擊落其三架。</p>
<h3 id="c5">日華南軍　實踐政府聲明 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　日華軍頃呼應日本政府七月五日之聲明，特於十二日發表書面談話如次：日本政府七月五日發表聲明，說明在華軍事行動之目的，為摧毀英美侵略東亞制霸東亞之野心，至於中國民眾，本為吾人之友，茍能拒絕與英美協力，即對渝軍亦不以敵人相視云云。溯自日華南軍於白雅絲灣登陸以來，即極力安定民生，為百姓謀幸福，對於渝方軍隊，復不斷促其反省。又幸華南民眾深明時局，洞察事實，刻正繼續向建設和平之途邁進。然美空軍強奪華南軍各地飛機塲，以之為基地，而盲炸各地，予民眾之損害甚大。於是日中國派遣軍乃毅然以擊滅此等英美勢力為目標，於華北華中華南展開大決戰。日華南軍在當地軍區於華北華中華南展開大決戰。日華南軍在當地軍區於六月二十七日，開始行動，目下於北江沿岸地區，向北推進，已到達連江戰綫，韶關之陷落即在目前。又使另一隊日軍於台附近，則進控制該地一帶，各方面民眾均深惡日軍作戰本意，繼續來歸，協力日軍。惟一部份民眾及自衛團，不明日軍之眞意，勉作抵抗，已為日軍殲滅，此實非日本之本意，乃不得已之措置。日軍今後決以日本政府之聲明為主旨極力實踐之。以證明日軍進行者，必為日本政府之眞意，而絕無誤解之事實發生。如此華南民眾固不待言，相信即渝方這隊亦必拒絕與英美協力，而來致力於建設大東亞，實決無疑也。</p>
<h3 id="c6">山岳地帶激戰　日軍進佔永豐　衡陽市內火光燭天 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>日軍前綫某基地十二日中央社電　包圍湘鄉之日軍精銳部隊，六月三十晚突以主力向西南進攻，其快速挺進部隊，冒酷熱氣候，於山嶽地帶搜索渝軍，前進二日，猛攻扼守天險之渝方第五十八師及第十五師之援軍，展開壯烈山嶽戰後，擊潰其一營，日軍已完全佔領永豐。按永豐位於湘鄉南方約六十公里，衡陽西北方約八十公里，為山嶽環繞之天險，此次日軍將其攻陷，已阻止敵機對衡陽方面之攻擊，使衡陽愈形孤立</p>
<p>湖南日軍前綫十二日中央社電　日軍精銳部隊，曾於三十日夕刻，由湘鄉開始向西南進擊，一向取退避態度之敵軍，頃以奪回湘鄉為目標，由二日晨起，已迫近湘鄉西方。胸有成竹嚴萬監視敵軍行動之日軍部隊，當於秘密中迴繞至敵軍背後，由三日拂曉一齊猛攻，已使敵第十五·四十五師主鴐完全潰滅。遭此意外急襲之敵軍，竟於狼狽之餘，忽呈混亂狀態，一部已向北方遁逃。是役日方所獲戰果如次：敵棄屍約三百具，俘虜五十人，鹵獲迫擊砲一門，其他武器子彈等甚多云。</p>
<p>日軍某基地十二日中央社電　衡陽市內渝軍已成襲中之鼠，日軍轟炸機隊，十一日晨再行猛炸該市，或作超低空俯衝轟炸，瞬間市內即已化為火海。</p>
<p>攻陷衡陽機塲經過</p>
<p>衡陽機塲十二日中央社電　衡陽機塲乃駐渝美空軍之反攻基地，自為日軍完全佔領後，日航空部隊長官乃於二十八日飛抵該機場，與挺進部隊長會晤。茲日挺進部隊發表談話，說明此次攻略衡陽機場之原因，調日軍在五馬歸　一帶澈底粉碎渝軍後，即從西方進攻衡陽機場，並採取大迂迴行動。由八尺嶺北方突擊渝軍之弱點，此為攻略衡陽機場之原因。當日軍突入該機場時，渝方其時亦未料及日軍來攻，及天明時，渝軍始作激烈之反攻，但機場則未受任何損害。</p>
<p>衡陽機場十二日中央社電　日軍攻取渝美空軍重要基地衡陽機場後，已將渝美空軍驅入西南內地。按衡陽機場位於湘江右岸，有滑走路數條，自北向南，橫陳機場前面，臨湘江，與衡陽城相對，背後有丘陵起伏。自機場北部至湘江與來江匯流處，乃樹木叢集之田園，機塲背後之丘陵，已成堅固之要塞陳地。機場寬達若十米之滑翔路，乃由特突　與縱橫錯綜之江流構成，構造極為巧妙。渝軍苦心孤詣之防備，由此已可見一斑。機場內之建設，現已完全被渝軍自行火毀。渝軍早知該機場必將陷落，乃於撤退前摧毀，機塲中央有北美式轟炸機一架，機身已分裂兩段。該機場內到處可發現正從事工作之遺跡，此即美國整備擴充之反映也。</p>
<h3 id="c7">美機襲越南　住民遭傷害 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>河内十二日中央社電　在渝美空軍最近連日來襲北部越南國境之村落，或投彈轟炸，或以機槍掃射，傷害當地良民，越南總督府當局十一日公表如次：九日上午，美空軍B25型五架，對國境之村落加以轟炸與掃射，炸傷住民。按當地並無軍事設施，無論敵方主張如何正當，實已違反人道，美國之宣傳力求使越人重視，此種流血事實，然有現情可證，其宣傳之毫無根據，業已顯然。又受害地方之損害，刻正傾力救濟中</p>
<h3 id="c8">南方日軍設置　電波監視綱　隨時可邀擊來襲敵機 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>印度前綫日軍基地十二日中央社電　隔印度洋與敵對峙之南方第一綫日瘒勇士，於密林中建設　走路，於泥沼及山岳地帶，設置高射砲陣地及電波監視綱。日軍佔據此地，由於原住民之協力，大規模之飛機場行將告竣。原住民為增強自給自足制度，均忙碌異常，然為早日完成防衛大東亞之陣地，村落之住民組成勤勞報國隊，紛紛來援，現在之基地情形，與旣往相異。三年前在敵機來至頭上時，始能發出警報，刻下各處布滿電波監視綱，在敵機來襲前若干時，警報即能發出，且能時時報知敵機之行動，於是基地之飛機立即騰空作戰，邀擊敵機。於遠處洋上，敵機逃出邀擊綱時，電波控知機當即傳達敵機之位置，探取敵機後，高射砲立即射出，如果仍未全部殲滅時，立刻實行反擊戰法，此乃防空機隊之決意也。</p>
<h3 id="c9">日第五次　中央協力會　定本月下旬舉行 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>

<p>柏林十二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍於十一日上午在克恩區奧納河之東，以及奧納與奧登河之間抵抗結果，已造成重大之勝利。英軍於十日在重大損失之代價下所佔領之地區，已完全被德軍收復。奧納河下游之東，英軍所突破之缺口一處，已爲德軍之突擊所堵合，同時河西之德軍繼續在克恩區障礙陣地之西南翼，殲減英軍尖劈形之猛攻隊。德衝鋒擲彈兵於十一日淸晨在坦克車與猛攻砲掩護之下，不顧反軸心靈之頑抗，以及敵榴彈砲與海軍砲之猛烈砲火，由馬爾托特向北進攻而抵達埃特維爾，英軍在德軍反攻中蒙受極大損失。埃期圭之北，德軍反攻亦順利進行，結果包圍並殲減英軍作戰部隊一集團。蒂萊之北，英軍於十一日上午以步兵與坦克車發動集中進攻，目的在於突破德陣，英軍在蒂萊·維勒波卡塞公路以東之猛攻被擊潰後，復於該公路之西進攻，但至中午時德軍又獲得防票上完全之勝利，敵死傷甚衆，下午局部缺口處之爭奪戰仍在進行中。法蘭西國民公路第一七一號與桑洛之間，以及維爾河下游全區京展開激戰，敵在維爾河與杜特河間之攻勢失敗後，即以强大之步兵與坦克車隊向桑洛發動正面之進攻，戰車之焦點在於國民公路之兩旁，以及沿由維勒福　通往南方之公路，除若干不重要之局部缺口外，美軍一切進攻至中午時均被挫折，據現有之報告，美坦克車被擊毀者不下四十三輛。</p>

<h3 id="c29">關於陳友仁先生的一個報告 <a href="#c29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— 李微塵</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>我這篇文章本來可以就但最近讀到一位伍澄宇先生在六月十日的新中國報上發表一篇「悼憶陳友仁先生」的文章，其中所紀，幾全與事實不符，因此，我不得不附帶在此，擇要略加修正。第一點須修正的是關於陳先生與同盟會的關係：第二點是關於陳先生在民國二十四年的計劃和活動；第三點是關於陳先生近兩年間的政治活動。</p>
<p>關於第一點，伍先生說：「在辛亥革命那年，我担任中國同盟會美洲支部部長，接到總理的電報，停止收會員………我是處在支部地位，祇有照辦。……不想千里達分會同志來了一個電報，說有位陳友仁先生正要入會，我那時爲黨務起見，馬上回電許可，把盟書月日提前便了。」</p>
<p>伍先生在這段紀較中，說得「栩栩欲生」，既有「來龍」亦有「去脈」，但可惜得很，爲史實計，我須負責聲明：陳先生始終沒有加入過同盟會。同時，在辛亥那年，陳先生是在倫敦，而並不是在「千里達」。此外，陳先生在辛亥歸國前還沒有別號，「友仁」二字的別號是辛亥歸國後在北京才開始用的。許多人以爲在革命黨中資格愈老愈好，所以便冒充「老同忠」。在我對陳先生的瞭解上，我深信他是不肯冒充的，亦不屑冒充的。</p>
<p>關於第二點，伍先生說：「到了民國二十四年，我接到家叔汝康的函，說陳先生由奠斯科來信，說中日事變難免發生，我們應該如何設法阻止，並且有種種的計劃，這不必說了。同時他並責備我，自從總理逝世，我就做起自了漢，很像不踏實的信徒了。我因受他的責備，到民國二十五年到港去請唐少川先生來，沒有很久，實現了西南政務會取消。」</p>
<p>對遺段紀事，我得明確聲明：陳先生在當時並沒有伍流生所說的種種計劃，亦沒有，更無從有阻止中日事變發生的計劃的任何行動。在民國二十四年，陳先生並沒有到過莫斯科，他是亡命在巴黎、退一步說，即使陳先生當時是有計劃的，亦不會間接商諸伍澄宇先生，更不會責備伍先生「自總理逝世就做起自了漢」，因爲陳先生當時的印象中還汶有伍澄宇先生的大名。</p>
<p>關於第三點，伍先生說：「……大東亞戰爭發生，陳先生不久後來上海，飛函約我和家叔到上海相敘，除了討論和平問題意見外，他殷股問着唐少川先生當時情形。……一直由去年到現在，我在滬和陳先生計議對收拾時局的辦法」。</p>
<p>對於伍先生這段紀事，我不得不鄭重聲明：陳先生遲次到上海後，絕對沒有「飛函」約伍澄宇先生或伍先生的令叔伍汝康先先來上海相敘。伍澄宇先生來見，是由伍汝康先生寫信介紹的，信是前年五月底由一位錢先生托我轉交陳先生的，因爲信中所寫的都是陳先生所不願聽的話，陳先生便置之不理，當中錢先生來訪幾次，我總沒有給地回音，後來伍澄宇先生亦來敝寓二三次託我代約，我亦勸過陳先生幾次，最後我勸他「何妨聽聽消息」，他才於八月裏接見伍先生，約見的經過是如此，當然不是「飛函約來相敘」了，伍先生對於近事的紀述尚且遠離事實到這樣程度，除事更可想而知了。</p>
<p>伍先生這次來見，那位錢先生是同來的，伍先生當時不過報告些消息及設了一些關於唐少川先生最後一年半年間的「事實」，此外，他並報告：「汪先生想請陳先生到南京見面詳談」‘對於這句話，陳先生會作適當的答覆，並且表示：「公博最近來過，始終沒有提到這事」。他繼而說了一番關於中國歷史上功罪的話。道是伍澄宇先生和陳先生第一次會面的情形，自然說不上「討論」，更說不上「討論和平問題」。</p>
<p>我還記得當伍先生錢先生辭出的時候，陳先生問我「What　doyou　think　of　this　Chap？」（這個人，你看怎樣？）並且說：「我以爲那位錢先生是伍澄宇，想不到汝康有這樣年紀老的侄兒」。</p>
<p>至於所謂「和陳先生在滬計議對收拾時局的辦法」，我亦得負責聲明：陳先生對中國前途問題，對任何來客都是隨便談的。但他始終沒有和任何人計議過「收拾時局的辦法」。中國前途問題是廣泛的，「收拾時局的辦法」是具體的，這常然不能相提並論，同時，隨便談談和「計議」亦是性質根本不同的二件事，或許伍先生是有意「計談」，陳先生却並無此意。我記得有一次伍先生同一位說是與李德隣自健生兩將軍很熟識的老先生來見，伍先生會提出所謂「開辦第三局面」問題，對這話，陳先生當時很鄭重的對我說：「請你使他們明白瞭解我對這類問題絕對不感興趣，中國今後的問題，是一個現代國家問題」，我隨即將這話翻譯出來，伍先生和陳先生見面一共不過幾次，說不上什慶友誼，更說不到密謀「計　」。</p>
<p>以上三點是與陳先生的政治關係及行動有關，我爲史實計，自不得不路加修正，因爲伍先生所紀的每一件事都把自己牽涉在內，我為修正事實，遂亦不得不涉及伍先生，這是無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>末了，我還要說明二點：　一，我寫這篇文章，一面在追紀陳先生由病至死的經過，一面又在追述他晚年的言行，餘衣尚慟，自不免帶着一些情感。但我絕不因我的情感而誇大他的事實，質直言之，我還對不起陳先生，我還沒有寫出地晚年可泣訂歌的事實，我亦沒有追紀他過去瓣功勛。</p>
<p>二，但我在大致上却已寫出他的性格，只要有他的性格，有他的宏願，有他的學問精思，自然會有他的義筒功勛　要蜂釀密，自有不期然而然者。即使陳先生無所表見，我亦認爲他的性格足緊人思，尤足以爲我們這個靑年未老先衰，中年未老先衰的民族今後的一個榜樣。陳先生三十七歲才開始他的新生命，自那時起以至於他的死，他始終是不衰頹，始終是積極的往前銜，始終是剛强不屈的在挺進，在奪鬥。我得告訴靑年們，為國家今後殺出一條血路，為建立一個嶄新的現代化的中國，這是必須而不能或缺的性格。「Work　And　Create」（工作，創造），這是陳先生生平實踐的座右銘，我得告訴靑年們，如果陳先生在他最後的那一分鐘能够向你們說話，我相信他一定是把這個座右銘很肅穆的，很誠掣的獻給你們，</p>
<p>不斷的努力「工作」！不斷的努力「創造造」！陳先生向來是指望着你們，陳先生永遠在期待着你們，中國的剛毅果敢的靑年！（完）七月二日寫於上海之有所不爲齋</p>

<p>昨日（七月十二）上午九時，上海特別市保安隊幹部集訓營補行開學典禮，是日計到陳司令公博，蘇局長成　，梁處長秀予，葉局長雪鬆，週督察長化人，及中央稅警學校李副教育長　久等，友邦方面到上海警備司令有富少將，及通絡部長能穀中佐等，各來賓濟濟一堂，參與盛典，儀式至隆重，首由該營營長劉純　氏報告訓練狀況，繼由陳司令熊處長及有富少將熊穀中佐等致訓詞，直至十一時典禮始　完成，全體並攝影以留紀念，茲誌該營營長報告及司令訓話如次：</p>
<p>司令訓話</p>
<p>各位來賓，各位長官學員們：今天是上海特別市保安隊幹部集訓營補行開學典禮的日子，我們爲甚麽　要成立這一個訓練機關，我們受訓的目的是什麽，剛才營長已經很詳細的報告過了，這次訓練的重心在於精神教練，所以在學術科方面都很簡單，在時間方面也很短促，因爲現在在這裏受訓的各位同志，以前已經受過嚴格的軍事訓練，這　再度集訓，要使你們在精神上更堅強起來。我知道各位有刻苦耐勞的精神，但在事實上常抵不住環境的壓迫，意志因而動搖，所以非將你們集中起來受訓不可，使你們能再得到一些精神的磨練，使思想更健全起來。上海的情形素來是複雜的，一般人民由於認識不清，以致民心萎麋，現在我來拿最淺白的話向各位說一說，譬如有錢的人，只知道消極的化費，而不知道積極的生産，沒有錢的人，就竭盡心計來謀取不義之財，大家心裏上都認爲國事糟糕，於是就不知振作，弄得道德淪落，這種情形在事變後更明顯。自從國民政府還都以後，我們就不應該再萎糜下去，我們應肅正思想，抛棄個人主義，大家以國家民族爲大前提，來荷負起組織民衆複興中華，保衛東亞的大使命。因爲唯有發揮民衆力量，才能複興中華，從複興中華才能再出發到保衛東亞，這樣我們前途才有希望，國家前途一有了希望，個人前途也一定有希望的，所以我深盼幹部集訓營的同志，大家都能認清目標，爲國家的前途打算，在最高領袖汪主席領導之下，來從事和建運動，各位若能遵照我的話去做，那末這次的集訓方有意義，今天我所講的祗是將受訓的意義簡單的提出來，向大家說一說，以後若有機會，我還要將守紀律這一個問題，向大家談一談，完了。</p>
<p>營長報告</p>

<p>爲解決五月以來日　　重的上海米糧問題，二十五日發表，從戰時物資移動取締暫行條例第六條中所規定的限制向上海地區移動的物資中，將米的一項剔除，同時，頒布京滬兩市民食米臨時措置。根據戰時物資移動取締暫行條例，　廢米糧移動的限制，並不是臨時的措置，可視爲米糧統制上根本的修正。依此根本的修正，乃有臨時性的“臨時　　綱要”之頒布，而在蘇浙皖三省，上海南京兩市，採取許可米糧自由移動的　久方針。任何人相信這措置是適應新事態的賢明措置，但這新方針對各省縣有極重大影響，尤以在江蘇省各縣，食米無限制向上海流出時，恐引起縣內民　恐慌，乃均　明加強限制移動，而專事安定米價，確保本縣食米，其具體狀況，前會從鬆江及蘇州簡單報告，記者所見聞的各縣對策中，鬆江，常熟，吳縣，武進，丹陽等等各縣，均表示堅持限制米糧移動如前。</p>
<p>許多縣政府正與上海市政府專努力解決上海市民的民食問題一樣，傾全力保持各該縣的民食米，實施嚴罰私運者及不正當米行，登記食米倉庫，限制縣民的購米量，決定最高市價，禁止移出縣外，獎勵移入縣內等對策。</p>
<p>某縣會　稱：“萬一上海市政府採取爲了上海市民而以其各縣民爲犧牲的方針，則我們對此不能不更強力行使緊急自衛手段”，事實上，在海南線列車中，不能　　運米至上海的民衆。當然，妨害有米統會正式護照的採辦證之米糧運輸等政策，絕對不會採取，在鬆江所見的米販之一時現象，完全不能見之於其他各縣。因而無正式護照者之搬出米糧，在嚴禁之例，而對於無正式護照之搬入縣內主要消費都市者，除囤積米外，米糧的搬出，不予禁止，而　激食米的縣內移動。</p>
<p>這樣的米糧新措置，一面更強化限制向縣外移動，一面則助長緩和向縣內限制移動傾向。各縣下的各區，都採取強化各以區爲單位的統制方策。此次措置的目的，本擬撤廢向以最大消費都市爲中心的上海搬出入之限制，而實現安定米價，然而我們覺得正走向相反的方向，這些統制方式稱爲縣單位米糧自治統制，但“私運”仍盛，縣或區的“公定價格”之外，也有黑市存在，新措置以前的狀態，並未有何變更。說者不　從法理論的立塲，批判國府或各縣政府，荒在青　不接期的食米問題，實在太重要了，不應僅以法理論爲第一　。又關於各縣食米絕對量的問題，此時亦避不涉及，據江蘇日報所戰之例，常熟縣長要求省政府米統會應停止收買工作，以解消縣內食米恐慌。像米統會過去的收買成績，記者不以爲足使食米不足的現象更　深刻，但各縣政府所最懼者，上海及各地區價格懸殊的結果，米糧的自由移動，將使食米無限制向上海移出，因此，各縣的米糧市價，將逐漸依上海水凖上昇，其結果，將使縣民的民生問題，更　深刻，事實上，如其想到鄉村的價格昇騰至新措置發表以前的上海市價一樣，或者更高，則各縣政府的措置，不能一概非難之爲反抗中央。</p>
<p>問題不在於表面上的措置方式。何故使縣政府出此手段同，實有重加檢討之必要。據我們的見解，當變更數年間從經驗而來的施策時，常發生與施策的目的相反的不良現象。因此，不是施策的變更，而是其革新實爲絕對必要。有革新民心庶能安定。民心安定庶能使政治經濟　於安定。（未完）（譯自六月二十三日大陸新報）</p>

<p>盟邦日本上海陸軍部報道部，於昨（十二）日下午二時半循例　南東路外灘華懋飯店八樓，舉行報道常會，會見本市中國新開記者　，出淵報道部長凖時偕同赤星囑　蒞會，即席特說明日軍進攻衡陽　說。此次日軍在大陸作戰，一貫發揚東方道義性的精神，最後又指出日軍在開始河南作戰時，　共競作自相殘殺之　態。茲分讀出淵氏談話如次：</p>
<p>道義精神</p>
<p>出淵報道部長首披　日軍作戰的道義性，已在此次大陸作戰上崇高的實踐，且較過去一切作戰，更爲前所未見的澈底。當日軍於不久前攻占洛陽長沙，願忍受在作戰上的不方便，決不使中國民衆受不利，有所損害。故日軍此次作戰的道義性已充分實踐，是在最近日軍攻擊衡陽時，在作戰上所主的道義性精神，與攻占長沙洛陽完全雷同，所以今次攻擊衡陽，以緩和姿態出擊，此即日軍把握一貫之作戰道義性也。除盡量避免無辜民衆深受戰禍，尤保護週圍的農物，不予摧毀，是以日軍之最大目標。頃日軍已控制美在渝空軍前進根據地衡陽機會，同時又控制重要交通要點，衡陽市內經日軍重重包圍之下，被困渝軍本身自行消滅，或使之降服，所以被圍渝軍實無法脫出重圍，殊難轉變局勢，故日軍既獲此兩個重要據點後，在道義的觀念下，決維護當地建設顧全民生。</p>
<p>渝　殘殺</p>
<p>孰料渝方軍事委員會竟藉機散佈虛僞報道，大吹大擂，而西籍駐渝記者亦相與狼狽爲奸，佯　渝軍勇敢非常，並詭謂衡陽防務鞏固，不惜掩蔽事實，　欺民衆，無異如臨終時之騷擾。總之日軍對衡陽，已具有把　，在優利的條件下，隨時可即攻陷整個衡陽，此點當加以深切的認識。查渝方在事實上，根本不能瞭解日軍的道義性，又未能認清作戰目標，且充分暴露野蠻態度。關於彼等的作戰行爲，荒誕絕倫，不得不加以揭發。當本年五月初旬，日軍發動河南作戰時，在展開神速的進攻下，致命打擊渝軍第一戰區湯恩伯部隊，　料斯時竟有盤踞湖北省北部的渝共兩軍，爲了爭奪地盤。發生重大衝突，雙方死傷達一千餘人。不幸事件的發生，在五月七八兩日，地點在湖北省　山縣，（相近湖南省邊境在平漢線東側）當時有配備之渝正規軍一部份，與挺路第四縱隊窺其用意，初爲攻擊日軍，嗣後，竟向新四軍第五　射擊中，強迫要求共軍移讓駐防地，其時雖明知第一區戰區　軍慘敗，亦不立刻予以援救，此種自相殘殺的　態，故彼輩作戰之目的及戰爭的理念，如何益使人加以懷疑揣測。</p>
<h3 id="c40">利用電話線鳴放警報　烏巢技師設計成功 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>本月九日防空日，上海市民防空本部首次利用電話地下線，同時鳴放警報，聲音整齊，響徹全市，成績甚佳。此次賴當局之策動，尤其上海電話公司機械科長鳥巢亭吉氏之苦心孤詣，得於旬日內不及十萬元之經費，完成此項偉大工程，實深慶幸。上月九日上海市民防空本部，會計劃統一本市汽笛鳴放警報之時間，然欲以一具開關，控制十八處汽笛需用大宗材料及器具，當時預約計三百六十萬元，防空本部雖知空　時有避免音響之必要，然工程浩大，究難著手，烏巢氏聞訊後，乃悉心研究對策，就技術上言，欲以弱電流控制強電流，殆爲不可能之事。然烏巢氏匠心獨　，卒能發明完善之運用方法，於本年六月二十三日設計就緒，當於月梢備齊材料，動工裝置，且以情勢緊迫之故，徹夜趕造，本月九日清晨六時全部完成，以時間侷促，未　試騐，然逕行施用後，竟能　用良如，制勝一切障礙，此項裝置之大要，爲藉電話線電流，用繼電器控制汽笛之電源開關。　日本在東京亦會試辦以電話線之弱電流，控制鳴放汽笛用之十匹馬力強電流，然亦深感困難，倘電經線發生障礙，則汽笛　然鳴放，日試騐與修理，均極困難，實　方面，頗多危險，此番鳥巢氏之設計，乃將繼電器之作用，分爲數個階段，藉弱電流之調節，用強電流控制強電流　　，一切危險乃得完全祛除，且利用電話公司既有設備，所需工費，減至三十六分之一以下，而預定半年之工程，竟於旬日內告成，減足　揚日本科學之優勝。陸軍防空司令部鑒於成績之卓越，亦擬將所有汽笛依法改裝。據烏巢氏雲，此項裝置，至爲妥善，汽笛機能既無減損，電話交接亦不受妨礙，且因汽笛電源，當時隔絕，故電話線雖遇切斷，或變爲短經，決無使汽笛鳴放之虞，　使汽笛發生障礙，不克鳴放，亦祇限放一　或一組而已。此次未經試驗則　成效，幸　　似，至於電話公司與防空本部之關係，當照申請專用錢之方式辦理，再　華商行吳確言君及其他職員，對於此項新穎裝置協助頗多，殊堪感佩</p>

<h3 id="c49">利潤比例分配說 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 張啓昆</p>
<p>—薪津制度之調整—</p>
<p>晚近萬物昻貴，而薪俸階級苦矣，因其雖有薪金可支，津貼可領，惟按諸實際，每入不敷出。雖薪津偶成梯形上升，但與物傻相較，則猶小巫之見大巫，此種情形，老幼咸知，而測其後果，可能促使社會中佔最多數之中等階級之全盤崩潰。此時也，貧富懸殊，各趨極端，整個經濟組織或將頻於破產，其害莫甚，緣有利潤比例分配說之議。</p>
<p>利潤比例分配者，即以某企業其一特定時期中所得之營業純益按比例均攤於勞資雙方也。此項辦法，魷道德之立塲言，亦甚公平，着一企業之有營業純益之發生，故有賴於管理者或受託經營者之投資得富，經營得法；但若無勞方厭其心血，則資本誠無從產生利益也。且利潤之增减，乃隨物價之高低而上落；換言之，即同生活程度之高低而有所升降，是較津貼制度爲便利，而無需隨時調整之麻煩也。是以利潤比例分配之實行，乃基於有福同享及權利與義務恒等之說而起，並補津貼制度之不足也。故從業人員之薪金應照舊支付，而津貼即由是廢止。</p>
<p>利潤比例分配說之實行也，因金業組織方法不同而互異，今再分論之：</p>
<p>獨資及合夥每月由司帳者結出本月之銷貨毛利，减各去項開支（包括薪金稅捐等），結出純益—店主或合夥人有於期期內提存，目爲預預支利潤，待利潤分配時扣除之。故純益帳中應計算本項金額在內—然後以三與七之比例，提交勞資，勞方再按等級之高下，爲比例之攤派。其詳則，因各業情形不同，從略。</p>
<p>公司組織與前述同，先結出本期毛利，除去開支，更進扣除股息，法定公積金，及　提帳戶等。再按三七之比例分配</p>
<p>但不幸某種企業有因產銷呆滯無純益發生時，該企業當按以往一年來每月之平均純益金額之百分之十五貼補職員，待業務好轉時，作爲費用之預支，分期攤償之。</p>
<p>至年終之將舟金紅利等，宜酌量再爲合理之分派</p>
<p>利潤比例分配說之方法略如上述，其利益除前述之道德之觀點及謀補津貼制度之不足外，尚有下列數點：</p>
<p>資方之利益益勞方因企業業務之興寡，直接間接影響其本人之收人，故必竭心藎力，無形中提高工作效率，促進業務之發達，更因利害相共，必相暸解，可免除意工等不幸事件之發生。</p>
<p>勞方之利益利潤比例分配說實行後，以今日之情形而觀，最少可謀最低限度生活之維持。</p>
<p>社會國家之利益一般薪俸階級生活之安定，可促進社會一進步繁榮，使生產消費入於正常，敎育慈善等公益事業富更能發展其效率，勞資之糾粉漸趨於零。最要者，利潤分配說之實行，從業人員必取嚴正之態度監視資方對財務之處理，此於國家稅務當不無補助，所得稅及消費特稅之漏說情形將由是銳减。</p>
<p>利潤比例分配之說，草如上述，尚待社會先進之探討，各業領袖之指導，則務俸隨級有幸焉。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3 id="c50">對於徵收保甲經費之意見 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 陳理聊</p>
<p>七月六日報載「保甲處本月起實施統一徵收保甲經費」，其內容略以「過去各保甲微收保甲經費，雖遵照法令規定，微收者固多；而因應付急需，甚至另起名目，擅自微收者，亦復不少。一警局爲整頓收費起見，業已訂定徵收保甲經費統一辦法，於本年七月一日起開始實行」等語。鄙人居住昌平路，隸屬江寗區，該區保甲經費，已自本年六月份起微，由正戶向附戶收取，給予保甲區收據一紙，但鄙人對於徵收保甲經費，謹具意見如下：</p>
<p>報載保甲經費，自七月一日起開始實行，則各戶六月份所繳之經費，應移轉爲七月份，換言少，即已繳六月份之保甲費者，七月份可不再繳納。</p>
<p>保甲經費微收數額之規定，自應以戶口多寡爲標準，（或保甲區之辦法已如此），其徵收等級，惟須明自公佈，必使家喻戶曉，庶幾達到實徵實解之目的。</p>
<p>鄙人繳納六月份保甲經費，其收據數字，由印就國幣五元之數，上再加蓋十元之戳記，即依照所蓋獲記數額徵收。按每一收據，所最重要者，即爲數字，（尤以微收機關爲更重要），如數字可任意涂改，流弊即就此發生，况收取是項經費，轉手頗多，故數字應不改爲宜，萬一礙於事實，而須變更徵收率時，爲節省物力起見，就原收據塗改權用，亦應具有足資證明涂改之練由，並新聞公示，方足以昭大信。</p>
<p>上述三點是否有當，尚祈保甲區明以鑒察。</p>

<p>本市教養團體，計有三十九處，收養兒童總總數約在五千名以上，近因物價猛漲，各項費用激增，而捐款來源較前銳减，維持極感困離。其中最難者即為粉食一項，自本市戶口米停止配給後，各團體之兒童生活威脅，益形加大，經當局之努力，續予按月配給特種米，但不數應用仍鉅，倘欲購黑市杜米，囚限於經費，勢所不能，乃不得已　量摻用雜糧補充。</p>
<p>據中華慈幼協會幹事了秉南君稱：現除有一部份之兒童團體，仍能維持一飯兩　或一飯一　外，其他團體大都每日三餐，均用稀飯，除午餐搭白糖少許外，早晚兩餐均以小麥赤豆山芋乾等雜糧充饥，依照目前情形，兒童每名每月最低限度　食費須在一千元以上、其用費與去年底相較，增加三倍有餘，而兒童目前所得營養之質量，反較遊於前，故對於兒童健康之增進，不無相當影響，除此物力維艱，欲維持此輩兒童最低限度之敎養，誠　乎其難，深盼社會熱心仕女，慨賜仁　，源源濟助，傳各敎養團體工作，不以經濟竭　而致　墜、則造福數千難童殊匪淺鮮。</p>

<h3 id="c53">海軍 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 岩豐雄著</p>
<p>櫻與舖（七）</p>
<p>從東京坐晚上十一點鐘的普普通快車，至第二天下午四時半，就可以到吳鎮。</p>
<p>隆夫就坐這一班車。心中以爲這趟列車一定很空，但事實恰恰相反，非常擁擠</p>
<p>因爲是很晚的夜車，所以車一開，客人立刻都開始睡覺了。在甚至動彈都不得的狹仄座位上，還能够甜密地入腫，真是一件有趣的事。</p>
<p>隆夫無論如何都睡不着。火車的　權，使隆夫聯想到晋京時的情景，更又使他想及此次回家省親前的心情變化。</p>
<p>（人類的反抗是有程度差別的。同時，人類的願望，是像無法撲滅的野火一樣頑强的）。</p>
<p>他不能不想到，他的海軍熱，是遠在真人以前發生的。</p>
<p>短暫的初夏之夜，在廣抓附近又看見　微的晨光了。除夫差不多一覺也沒睡。早晨的太陽逐潮上昇時，隆夫反而開始無了。名古屋和京都，都在睡夢中過去了。</p>
<p>一到山陽綫，眞人的面孔就倏然出現於面前了。昨天下午曾抽出到達時問的電報去，但值現中的眞人，能到車站去迎接麼？假如不來接，他的軍艦一定又出動了。如果那樣，就在下一班車，回家省親去，當回東京來時再來吳鎮一訪吧！</p>
<p>心中正在這樣想時，瀨戶內海的入江就出現於車窗了。從系崎至吳鎮這一小時半，景　雖好，但覺着時間過得太慢。</p>
<p>一到吳鎮，月台上有無數的人。十六歲來參觀旅行時，和真人一同下了火車，曾覺得非常冷淸，而現在却擁擠不堪。在這樣混雜當中，曾看見了幾位海軍士官。隆夫總以為是真人，但都認錯了。</p>
<p>（結果真人一定不能來。）</p>
<p>正在這樣想的時候，一走出出口，而從背後就有人來敲肩膀。</p>
<p>「你在這個地方麼？我在前面二等車的地方</p>
<p>遙個聲音很熟。正像在銀座大街上所碰到的情形一樣，是穿着西裝的眞人。</p>
<p>「是坐的三等車。你應當知道的。」隆夫因爲過於高興，反而說不大出話來。</p>
<p>「你已經是畫家了，所以我以爲你坐二等。像我這樣窮的少尉，還要坐頭等呢，何况你呢？那末到這邊來吧！近來人非常擁濟。」</p>
<p>眞人因爲地方業已熟了，所以就在人山人海中領着道。（一一六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Preemptive Action and Concentration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Fleet Press Officer of the Allied Japanese Forces in China, Colonel Matsushima, said at a symposium of the Federation of Industry and Commerce on the 6th that Japan's strategy lies in preemptive action and concentration: preemptive action means striking first, and concentration means focusing all efforts. While these are strategic principles, they can equally be applied to all aspects of life. In this great era, as the entire world is at war and all of humanity is engaged in a tense struggle, preemptive action and concentration should be everyone's motto.</p>
<p>Military strategy dictates that "he who strikes first controls the situation; he who strikes later is controlled." Therefore, preemptive action means taking the initiative. Those who can seize the initiative can negotiate or fight, attack or defend; all actions are entirely dependent on oneself. One is not directed, exploited, or provoked by others; one does not engage in passive response. One is simply proactive, relying on one's own thoughts, knowledge, and experience to decide what should be said and done, seizing the moment, and resolutely implementing it immediately, without hesitation or timidity, advancing bravely. How can one gain the initiative? Firstly, it depends on diligent preparation in peacetime; secondly, it depends on determination and perseverance at the critical moment. Like a chess game, a master who has studied diligently in peacetime has a well-thought-out plan before the game. Once a few pieces are played, the situation is set. Following the predetermined strategy, each move is made to gain the upper hand, leaving the opponent scrambling and unable to cope. As the saying goes, "first move advantage," and "one wrong move, the whole game is lost," because once the initiative is lost, one is passive everywhere, and the opportunity to win is lost.</p>
<p>While preemptive action is a strategy on the battlefield, applying this strategy requires immense strength as a backup. Therefore, preemptive action is not a skill; it is a manifestation of strength. The Great East Asia War is a clear example. When the Allied Japanese Forces decided to negotiate with the United States and then decided to go to war, they devoted all efforts to negotiation. When negotiation was impossible and the decision was made to go to war, they immediately declared war. When declaring war, they decided on the methods of warfare and resolutely implemented them, catching the enemy off guard. Battlefield operations change in an instant; attack when you can attack, defend when you can defend; attack in some places, defend in others – all planned in advance. Because the Allied Japanese Forces were prepared in peacetime and had perseverance at the critical moment, they were proactive everywhere, had the first move everywhere, and demonstrated strength everywhere.</p>
<p>Because preemptive action is a manifestation of strength, preemptive action and concentration of all efforts are closely related. Only by being able to take preemptive action can one achieve ultimate victory. Dispersing forces is a major taboo on the battlefield. Looking at the Great East Asia War over the past two years, the Allied Japanese Forces' victories and the British and American failures are fundamentally due to the concentration and dispersion of forces.</p>
<p>The war situation is constantly changing, but the principles of the battlefield remain unchanged. Those who can seize the initiative and concentrate all their efforts will certainly be able to win. This is the trend of the times, and there is no doubt about it.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Air Force Sorties in the Rain, Re-Attacking Myitkyina Airfield, Shooting Down Eleven Enemy Planes in Air Combat <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>From the Burma Front, 12th, Central News Agency: The fighter squadron on the Burma front has been sortieing in the rain for days to support ground and naval operations. On the afternoon of the 9th, it once again launched a large-scale surprise attack on Myitkyina Airfield, bombing military facilities near the airfield amidst intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and engaging P40 fighters patrolling the skies, shooting down five (one unconfirmed). Later, 50 kilometers southwest of Myitkyina, ten B25s and eleven P51s escorting the squadron were discovered, leading to a fierce air battle, shooting down two B25s and four P51s (one unconfirmed). Three Japanese planes did not return in this operation.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 12th, Central News Agency: On the night of the 10th, Japanese forces in northern Burma launched a night attack on enemy forces stubbornly resisting near Pabhok (10 kilometers southwest of Hukong Valley), which possessed mortar positions. A melee ensued, and the enemy, several times the size of the Japanese forces, was thrown into great confusion. Enemy losses confirmed to date include 54 bodies left behind. Also, since the 9th, enemy forces in that area have been gradually concentrating their forces near Pabhok and constructing mountain gun positions. To this end, the Japanese forces, with a preemptive strike, directly attacked enemy forces crossing the Nam Gaun River, inflicting heavy damage on a portion of them and repelling their main force on the riverbank. In this operation, a large number of Czech machine guns and other military equipment were seized, thwarting the enemy's counterattack.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Recent Air Force Battle Results: Heavy Blow to Chongqing-Based American Planes <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, News Agency dispatch: Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on July 12th that Japanese air force units in China have been attacking American air bases in China for days, and are continuing to do so. The battle results from July 3rd to 11th are as follows: 11 shot down (two unconfirmed), 95 destroyed and burned. During the above period, seven Japanese Air Force planes were lost due to crashes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, Central News Agency: The offensive launched by the Japanese forces on the China front is progressing extremely smoothly. On the Henan front, the remnants of the First War Zone of Chongqing and the Hu Zongnan army coming from the Eighth War Zone have been severely damaged. On the Hunan front, after capturing Hengyang Airfield, a portion of the forces are attacking Hengyang, while the main force continues to advance towards the heart of the Chongqing war zone. On the Guangdong front, Japanese forces are advancing north along the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, breaking through defenses and capturing cities. At the same time, the Japanese air force units in China are also responding to the advancing ground battles, achieving remarkable results day after day. On the 10th, a surprise attack on 28 planes inside the Guilin Airfield completely destroyed them, setting them on fire. On the 11th, an attack on Dantu destroyed six of the dozens of planes in the airfield and set them on fire. In total, in the nine days from the 3rd to the 11th, 11 Chongqing-based American planes were shot down (two unconfirmed), and 95 were destroyed and burned. Also, in mid-June, a total of more than 200 enemy planes were shot down, destroyed, and burned. Adding the recently announced results from early July, in the past forty-odd days, the Chongqing-based American Air Force has lost as many as 306 planes. The coordinated operations of the Japanese air and ground forces can be said to have dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing-based American Air Force.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Guilin Airfield</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 11th, Central News Agency: During the air raid on Guilin Airfield, Chongqing forces used all anti-aircraft guns to fire and challenged with fighter planes. The Japanese bomber squadron displayed a fearless spirit, flying very low, and bombed the intended targets. In this battle, a bomb hit the tail of the plane of Japanese Captain, and Sergeant Matsumoto's plane was also hit in the fuselage, but it was not shot down, and all returned safely to their original location. According to Staff Sergeant Yoda of the bomber squadron, the sky was clear and starry that night, and the city was under blackout, with no lights visible. The airfield was located 17 kilometers west of Guilin City, and the airfield was clearly visible due to the moonlight. The leading planes targeted the enemy planes parked on the ground and dropped bombs. At this time, the anti-aircraft guns and machine guns at the north end of the airfield opened fire to resist, and the rest quickly turned their planes, ascended, and escaped the fire. Also, Staff Sergeant Kawauchi said that there was a large building in the center of the city, which he remembered to be the American Consulate. The city was surrounded by roads in all directions, and large buildings such as military factories were scattered among them. The Yang Squadron passed through the city and reached the airfield, and after bombing and dropping bombs, just as they were about to ascend, two small bombs hit the tail of the plane, but it was not severely damaged and still returned to base. Also, Sergeant Matsumoto said that Guilin was known as an important air fortress, and its anti-aircraft fire was very intense. After his plane dropped bombs, it was fired upon by fifteen or sixteen anti-aircraft machine guns, and fireballs exploded around the fuselage. After returning to base, it was discovered that the fuselage had been hit, but all the crew members were safe and unharmed.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese frontline base, 12th, Central News Agency: The Japanese bomber squadron bombed Dantu Airfield in Guangxi Province at 3:00 PM on the 11th. At that time, there were more than a dozen "P-51" type planes parked on the field, and six of them were blown to pieces. The above-mentioned Japanese planes also repeatedly strafed barracks and military facilities, inflicting heavy damage on them. All the Japanese planes returned safely to base.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese frontline base in China, 12th, Central News Agency: Six enemy American Air Force P41s attempted to invade the airspace of Guangzhou at 8:30 AM on the 11th. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and shot down three of them near Lupao (50 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou).</p>
<h3 id="e5">Japanese Southern China Army Practical Government Statement <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Southern China Army, echoing the Japanese government's statement on July 5th, issued a written statement on the 12th as follows: The Japanese government issued a statement on July 5th, explaining that the purpose of military operations in China is to destroy the ambitions of Britain and the United States to invade and dominate East Asia. As for the Chinese people, they are our friends. If they refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army will not be regarded as enemies. Since the Japanese Southern China Army landed in Bias Bay, it has been striving to stabilize the people's livelihood and seek happiness for the people. The Chongqing army has also been constantly urged to reflect. Fortunately, the people of Southern China deeply understand the current situation and see the facts clearly, and are now continuing to move towards the path of building peace. However, the American Air Force forcibly seized airfields in various places in Southern China and used them as bases to blindly bomb various places, causing great damage to the people. Therefore, the Japanese China Expeditionary Army resolutely aimed at destroying these British and American forces and launched a decisive battle in North China, Central China, and Southern China. The Japanese Southern China Army began operations on June 27th in the local military districts in North China, Central China, and Southern China. At present, it is advancing north along the Beijiang River area and has reached the Lianjiang front. The fall of Shaoguan is imminent. Another unit of the Japanese army controlled the area near Taishan. The people from all walks of life deeply hate the original intention of the Japanese army's operations and continue to come and cooperate with the Japanese army. However, a part of the people and self-defense corps, not understanding the true intention of the Japanese army, made a reluctant resistance and have been annihilated by the Japanese army. This was not the Japanese army's original intention, but an unavoidable measure. The Japanese army will resolutely implement the Japanese government's statement as its main objective in the future, to prove that what the Japanese army is doing is the true intention of the Japanese government, and that there will be no misunderstanding. In this way, the people of Southern China will certainly not need to be told, and it is believed that even the Chongqing army will refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States and devote themselves to building Greater East Asia. This is undoubtedly certain.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fierce Fighting in Mountainous Areas, Japanese Forces Occupy Yongfeng, City of Hengyang Ablaze <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>A certain Japanese frontline base, 12th, Central News Agency: The elite units of the Japanese army surrounding Xiangxiang suddenly attacked southwest with their main force on the evening of June 30th. Their rapidly advancing units searched for Chongqing forces in mountainous areas in the scorching heat. After advancing for two days, they fiercely attacked the Chongqing 58th Division and the 15th Division's reinforcement troops guarding the natural barriers, and after a fierce mountainous battle, they crushed one of their battalions. The Japanese army has completely occupied Yongfeng. Yongfeng is located about 60 kilometers south of Xiangxiang and about 80 kilometers northwest of Hengyang. It is a natural barrier surrounded by mountains. This time, the Japanese army has captured it, preventing enemy planes from attacking the Hengyang area and making Hengyang even more isolated.</p>
<p>Japanese frontline in Hunan, 12th, Central News Agency: The elite units of the Japanese army began to advance southwest from Xiangxiang on the evening of the 30th. The enemy, which had been taking an evasive attitude, is now aiming to recapture Xiangxiang, and has been approaching the west of Xiangxiang since the morning of the 2nd. The Japanese army units, who had a well-thought-out plan and were closely monitoring the enemy's movements, secretly circled behind the enemy and launched a fierce attack all at once at dawn on the 3rd, completely annihilating the main force of the enemy's 15th and 45th Divisions. The enemy, caught in this unexpected surprise attack, suddenly became chaotic and a part fled north. The battle results obtained by the Japanese side were as follows: about 300 enemy bodies were abandoned, 50 prisoners were captured, one mortar was seized, and many other weapons and ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 12th, Central News Agency: The Chongqing army in Hengyang City has become rats in a sack. The Japanese bomber squadron launched another fierce bombing of the city on the morning of the 11th, or made super-low-altitude dive bombing. The city was instantly turned into a sea of fire.</p>
<p>Process of Capturing Hengyang Airfield</p>
<p>Hengyang Airfield, 12th, Central News Agency: Hengyang Airfield was the counterattack base for the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing. After it was completely occupied by the Japanese army, the commander of the Japanese air force flew to the airfield on the 28th and met with the commander of the advancing units. The advancing units then gave a statement explaining the reasons for this capture of Hengyang Airfield, stating that after the Japanese army thoroughly crushed the Chongqing forces in the Wumagui area, they attacked Hengyang Airfield from the west and took a large detour, attacking the weak point of the Chongqing forces north of Bachiling. This was the reason for capturing Hengyang Airfield. When the Japanese army broke into the airfield, the Chongqing forces did not expect the Japanese army to attack, and the Chongqing forces began a fierce counterattack at dawn, but the airfield did not suffer any damage.</p>
<p>Hengyang Airfield, 12th, Central News Agency: After the Japanese army captured Hengyang Airfield, an important base for the American Air Force in Chongqing, they have driven the Chongqing-based American Air Force into the southwestern interior. Hengyang Airfield is located on the right bank of the Xiang River, with several runways stretching from north to south across the front of the airfield, facing the Xiang River and opposite Hengyang City, with undulating hills behind it. From the northern part of the airfield to the confluence of the Xiang River and the Lai River, there are fields covered with trees. The hills behind the airfield have become a solid fortress. The airfield's 10-meter wide runway is constructed of special stone and crisscrossing rivers, making the construction extremely clever. The Chongqing army's painstaking preparations can be seen from this. The construction inside the airfield has now been completely destroyed by the Chongqing army themselves. The Chongqing army knew that the airfield would inevitably fall, so they destroyed it before retreating. In the center of the airfield, there is a North American bomber, with its fuselage split in two. Traces of work being carried out can be found everywhere in the airfield, which is a reflection of American maintenance and expansion.</p>
<h3 id="e7">American Planes Attack Vietnam, Residents Injured <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi, 12th, Central News Agency: The American Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently been attacking villages on the northern border of Vietnam for days, either bombing or strafing with machine guns, injuring local civilians. The Governor-General's Office of Vietnam announced the following on the 11th: On the morning of the 9th, five American Air Force B25s bombed and strafed villages on the border, injuring residents. There are no military facilities in the area. No matter how legitimate the enemy claims to be, they have violated humanitarian principles. American propaganda seeks to make the Vietnamese people value this, but these bloody facts, evidenced by the current situation, clearly show that their propaganda is groundless. Assistance is being provided to the affected areas.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Southern Army Establishes Radio Wave Monitoring Network, Ready to Intercept Enemy Planes at Any Time <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Japanese frontline base in India, 12th, Central News Agency: The brave warriors of the southern frontline facing the enemy across the Indian Ocean are building roads in the dense forests and setting up anti-aircraft gun positions and radio wave monitoring networks in the swamps and mountainous areas. The Japanese army occupied this area, and with the cooperation of the indigenous people, the large-scale airfield is about to be completed. The indigenous people are extremely busy strengthening the self-sufficiency system, but to complete the defense of Greater East Asia as soon as possible, the villagers formed a Labor Service Corps and came to assist. The situation at the base is different from the past. Three years ago, an alarm could only be issued when enemy planes arrived overhead. Now, radio wave monitoring networks are spread everywhere, and the alarm can be issued some time before the enemy planes arrive, and the movement of the enemy planes can be reported at all times. Therefore, the planes at the base immediately take off to fight and intercept the enemy planes. When enemy planes escape the interception network in the distant ocean, the radio control plane immediately transmits the position of the enemy planes and searches for them. The anti-aircraft guns immediately fire. If they are still not completely annihilated, a counterattack tactic is immediately implemented. This is the determination of the air defense squadron.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Fifth Japanese Central Cooperation Council to be Held in Late July <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th, Central News Agency: The Fifth Japanese Central Cooperation Council has decided to be held for six days from the 22nd to the 29th (the 25th and 28th will be suspended due to cabinet meetings).

<p>Manila, 12th, Central News Agency: Since the Japanese government recognized the independence of the Philippines last October, the Japanese Philippine Expeditionary Force has been preparing various measures to make the Republic of the Philippines a fully independent nation. Therefore, the transfer of various rights and interests related to transportation and industry is also being earnestly prepared. In November of last year, the Japanese military authorities, recognizing the importance of food administration, first transferred the Rice Control Company to the Philippine government, and then transferred public works and national companies. Regarding the transfer of administrative supervision of national companies, a transfer committee has also been established between Japan and the Philippines, and they are earnestly working to reach an agreement. Recently, the opinions of both sides have been completely consistent, and official documents regarding the transfer have been exchanged. The transfer procedures will be completed as soon as the Philippine government completes its preparations. Regarding this point, the Japanese authorities stationed in the Philippines will issue a statement explaining the situation of this transfer. At the same time, the Philippine government also expressed deep gratitude for the Japanese side's measures to transfer economic rights and interests, and issued a statement saying that due to Japan's implementation of the above measures, the Philippine industry will be able to move further towards soundness.</p>
<h3 id="e11">German Counterattack in Normandy, Front Line Extends Over a Hundred Miles, Allied Forces Southwest of Caen Suffer Major Setbacks <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th, Central News Agency Telecommunications Agency News: British press reports: The fighting south of Caen is becoming more intense and a major battle has unfolded. Yesterday, British and Canadian troops suffered a fierce counterattack from German forces and were forced to withdraw from Martot. The Normandy front has extended for 111 miles. The British, American, and Canadian troops in the central and western sections are bombarding with heavy artillery to cover the advance of infantry, but in fact, only a few advances have been made.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Central News Agency: German News Agency News: The German army achieved a major victory as a result of resisting on the morning of the 11th east of the Orne River in the Caen area, and between the Orne and Odon Rivers. The area occupied by the British army at the cost of heavy losses on the 10th has been completely recovered by the German army. East of the lower reaches of the Orne River, a gap broken through by the British army has been blocked by a German assault. At the same time, the German army west of the river continued to annihilate the British army's pincer-shaped assault force on the southwestern flank of the Caen area's obstacle positions. On the morning of the 11th, German assault grenadiers, under the cover of tanks and assault guns, disregarded the anti-axis powers' stubborn resistance and the heavy artillery fire of enemy howitzers and naval guns, advanced north from Martot and reached Eterville. The British army suffered great losses in the German counterattack. North of Esquay, the German counterattack also proceeded smoothly, resulting in the encirclement and annihilation of a group of British army combat units. North of Tilly, the British army launched a concentrated attack with infantry and tanks on the morning of the 11th, aiming to break through the German lines. After the British army's attack east of the Tilly-Villers-Bocage highway was defeated, they attacked west of the highway, but by noon the German army had again gained complete victory on the defense front. The enemy suffered many casualties. In the afternoon, the battle for local gaps was still ongoing. Between French National Highway 171 and Saint-Lô, and in the entire area downstream of the Vire River, fierce fighting unfolded. After the enemy's offensive between the Vire and Drôme Rivers failed, they launched a frontal attack on Saint-Lô with a strong infantry and tank force. The focus of the tanks was on both sides of the national highway, and along the highway leading south from Villers-Focage. Except for some unimportant local gaps, all American attacks were thwarted by noon. According to current reports, no less than 43 American tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Central News Agency Urgent Dispatch: Haikoku Tsushinsha reported today: The German army has recovered the city of La Haye-du-Puits from the troops of American General Bradley.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Bose's Broadcast to India: The Inevitability of Japan's Victory <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon Front, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - Subhas Chandra Bose, head of the Provisional Government of Free India, broadcast to his homeland of India on the evening of the 9th, explaining the current situation in East Asia and elaborating on the inevitability of Japan's victory. The gist is as follows: The repeated defeats of the British in Europe and East Asia are of great benefit to India's struggle for freedom. The British have lost territory from Hong Kong to the Chindwin River and cannot recover it. In the current war, a determination to either live or die is a necessary condition for achieving victory, as well as a great spirit indispensable for winning. Japan possesses this spirit. The "Europe First" policy has exhausted the British and Americans. Therefore, if the United States and others attempt to attack in East Asia again, there is no other path but defeat. American productivity has reached its peak and will only decline in the future; there is no possibility of it increasing. However, Japan, with its meticulous preparation and comprehensive implementation of policies, can certainly increase its productivity in the future. The heavier the losses of the United States, the lower its morale and national strength will be. Japan's national defense line is as solid as a rock. Although the U.S. military has repeatedly attempted to attack, there is no possibility of a breakthrough. Furthermore, this main war relies not only on weapons, but also on morale, which occupies an important position. It is a fact that Japanese morale surpasses that of the United States. The long-term resistance of Chongqing cannot be dismissed in terms of its military value, but its soldiers and generals will weaken due to Japan's countermeasures. Recently, there have been many voices within Chongqing advocating that there is no need to resist Japan any longer. Moreover, due to the defeat of the Chongqing army in the Changsha area, Chongqing's morale will decline even further. Finally, we must know that the British and Americans have no possibility of defeating Japan. At the same time, the outcome of the European war will have no impact on East Asia. Therefore, Japan's victory is undoubtedly certain.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Increased Pressure from Britain and the United States: Turkey's Attitude Remains Unchanged <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Istanbul, 12th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - News from Istanbul: Political activity in Istanbul is extremely active due to the increased pressure from Britain and the United States. Yesterday, German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, held a long conversation with Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu before the latter departed for Istanbul. British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen returned here yesterday, awaiting a major decision from the British government regarding its diplomatic policy towards Turkey. Diplomatic observers here are all of the opinion that although Britain and the United States have recently increased pressure on Turkey, there is no sign that Turkey will change its attitude. It is heard that the Turkish Prime Minister will present a report on the recent international situation to members of the Republican People's Party in parliament, and will elaborate on Turkey's attitude towards the demands of the anti-Axis powers. It is believed that important political decisions will also be made at this meeting.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to Moscow, the Red Army has crossed the Latvian border and is deploying its front lines beyond the border.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Soviet troops in the Vilna area, in order to coordinate with the Soviet troops advancing west of Utiena (between Vilna and Daugavpils), have attacked from the northwest. As of the 11th, they have reached a line 65 kilometers east of Kaunas in Lithuania. The German army, with its back to the Dnieper River, is fighting fiercely with the vanguard of the Soviet army in the lake area. Elsewhere, on the 10th, a new offensive was launched north of Nevel. On the 11th, Soviet troops advanced to the western border of Latvia, coordinating with the offensive in the Daugavpils area, attempting to reach the Baltic Sea. The battle situation on that front has gradually reached its climax. The Soviet troops on the Carson front are currently advancing on three routes: from the Rēzekne area towards Gorodok, from the Slonim area towards Białystok, and from the Luninyets area towards Pinsk and Brest-Litovsk. The German side received reinforcements of new reserve armored units on the 11th and has launched a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - German News Agency reports: Military sources say that the Soviet army added newly-equipped rifle divisions and two tank corps to the battle in an attempt to crush the German lines in the Kovel area. This attempt by the Soviet army was thwarted. In the fierce fighting, the Soviet army lost 295 tanks and many other war implements, forcing them to abandon further offensives. However, the Soviet army has concentrated a large number of troops on the southern route, so it seems inevitable that the Soviet army will launch a large-scale offensive in the near future. However, the situation on some sections of the central and northern routes remains very serious. The Soviet army is continuously attacking Kaunas (a major city in Lithuania) from both the north and south of Vilna, but the German garrison in Vilna is still firmly defending the city against the fierce Soviet attacks. The Soviet army has the advantage in manpower and heavy weapons, so its pressure continues to increase unabated. The difficult situation of the German troops besieged in Vilna demonstrates the unparalleled bravery of the German army. In the Baranovichi area, the Soviet army is intensifying its attack on Salos. The main focus of the Third Soviet Army offensive is in the Daugavpils (in Latvia) area. The Soviet army is attempting to break through with powerful tank units and several rifle divisions, but was blocked south of the city. In the Propoysk area, the Soviet army halted its offensive due to suffering heavy losses.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The gold market has seen an alarming surge in prices over the past month, soaring nearly twofold, which not only affects the general rise in commodity prices but also poses a great threat to the entire financial system. The reasons for the rise are nothing more than a large amount of idle capital turning to the gold market for speculation and manipulation by large players. Therefore, it is hoped that the Central Reserve Bank authorities will give careful consideration to releasing funds and that interbank lending should be tightened if it is not used for legitimate industrial and commercial purposes, so as not to allow it to be used for manipulation in the gold market. As for those who secretly manipulate it, the relevant authorities are especially urged to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them as soon as possible in order to stabilize people's livelihood and stabilize finance.</p>
<p>Report on Actual Commodity Price Collection</p>

<h3 id="e25">Overseas Chinese Investment in Hong Kong to Assist in Construction <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - The total capital of overseas Chinese in Hong Kong amounts to [blank] million yuan, but before the war, only tens of thousands of yuan were invested in industrial capital, and the rest was mostly used in commercial capital similar to speculation. This is because industrial capital is not as easy or safe to profit from as commercial capital. This unhealthy economic development changed after the Japanese army implemented military administration and various economic measures. Overseas Chinese capital, which was previously used exclusively for importing consumer goods, has now been re-oriented towards building Greater East Asia due to the demands of the times. Overseas Chinese capital, which was previously regarded as floating fire, now has a thorough understanding and hope for building a new Hong Kong and is turning the use of fire capital to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. The main points are roughly as follows: To thoroughly implement shipbuilding plans and revitalize transactions throughout the region centered on Hong Kong. To engage in economic construction centered on Hong Kong. To implement various economic countermeasures to ensure the people's food supply. However, after the existing materials are exhausted, the transaction department in Hong Kong itself will inevitably evolve to a point where it is cut off from commercial capital, that is, at that time, overseas Chinese capital will inevitably be linked to the industrial production department. At the same time, overseas Chinese capital is active in ensuring food supplies. It is said that the previous general rice distribution system has recently been revised to implement free rice for the general public, and further measures have been taken to allow free import of various important foods to Hong Kong and to promote rice imports. Overseas Chinese capital is working hard on rice import work in response to cooperatives and guilds. Due to this situation, overseas Chinese capital has a tendency to move in a new direction, so the cooperation of overseas Chinese capital in the economic construction of the new Hong Kong is truly expected.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Xuchang and Yancheng Recover and Prosper <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Zhengzhou, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - Xuchang and Yancheng, two central Henan towns, have made great strides in construction activities since being captured by the Japanese army in mid-May, although it has only been two months. They have now been restored as commercial cities in central Beijing-Hankou Line. Xuchang, with a pre-war population of 41,000, is a distribution center for tobacco leaves. Since ancient times, its trade with Central China has been very active, so its recovery is also extremely rapid. After the establishment of the maintenance society, a self-defense corps with 1,800 members was formed in early June. Next, a police station with hundreds of officials was also established. The refugees have also returned one after another, sharing the burden of maintaining security and restoring business and prosperity in the market. Currently, 18,000 people have returned. Silk and satin shops and leather shoe stores line Zhongshan Road in the central area, and the cityscape has gradually recovered. There are a total of five cigarette factories, including the Meiyu series. Among them, the East Asia Tobacco Factory started operations on June 25. There are many varieties of Xuchang cigarettes, and the quality is good. The output in the 30th year of the Republic of China was 1.2 million dan. Since the ban on tobacco planting and the change to food crops in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China, the output has decreased. Since the establishment of the Henan Tobacco Monopoly Bureau on the 1st day of the 31st year of the Republic of China, it has accounted for a large part of the financial revenue of the Zhuyu government, and in the future, the economic driving force of Henan's new local products will also be greatly related. Heihezi (3 kilometers west of Yancheng) is located at the intersection of the old Beijing-Hankou Line and the Ru River, and is also an important place for water and land transportation. The appearance of a newly emerging commercial city is also becoming increasingly prosperous. The construction committee centered on the Chamber of Commerce is working hard to restore the city streets. It is heard that the damaged electric light factory has now been repaired, and the new Heihezi has been restored. In addition, the bridge construction project on the Ru River is also underway. The construction of the central Henan region centered on Xuchang and Yancheng is making rapid progress.</p>

<p>Peiping, 12th (Central News Agency telegram) - North China cotton production is in good condition due to smooth planting, with 82% of the planned area completed. Due to the good harvest of wheat in this city, all cotton fields were planned to be converted to wheat planting, and cotton seeds were in short supply. Therefore, under this circumstance, it was still possible to harvest 80% according to the planned schedule. The effectiveness was due to the efforts of the cotton production guidance agency and the abolition of the fixed price for cotton purchases on April 18. Currently, due to the harmony of rain and temperature, experts are optimistic about cotton production.</p>

<h3 id="e29">A Report on Mr. Chen Youren <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Li Weichen</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>I could have just ended this article, but recently I read an article by Mr. Wu Chengyu published in the Xin Zhonghua Bao on June 10, titled "Remembering Mr. Chen Youren," in which the recorded details are almost entirely inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I must incidentally add to this and make necessary corrections. The first point that needs correction is regarding Mr. Chen's relationship with the Tongmenghui (Chinese United League); the second is regarding Mr. Chen's plans and activities in 1935; and the third is regarding Mr. Chen's political activities in the past two years.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, Mr. Wu said: "In the year of the Xinhai Revolution, I served as the head of the American branch of the Tongmenghui. I received a telegram from the President to stop recruiting members... I was in a branch position and had to comply... Unexpectedly, comrades from the Trinidad branch sent a telegram saying that a Mr. Chen Youren was about to join the party. For the sake of party affairs, I immediately sent a reply agreeing to it and advanced the date of the alliance oath."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu described this account in a very "vivid" manner, with both "origins" and "destinations," but unfortunately, for the sake of historical accuracy, I must responsibly state that Mr. Chen never joined the Tongmenghui. At the same time, in the year of Xinhai, Mr. Chen was in London, not in "Trinidad." In addition, Mr. Chen did not have a pen name before returning to China in Xinhai; the pen name "Youren" only began to be used in Beijing after returning to China in Xinhai. Many people think that the older the qualification in the revolutionary party, the better, so they falsely claim to be "old comrades." Based on my understanding of Mr. Chen, I firmly believe that he would not pretend, nor would he deign to pretend.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, Mr. Wu said: "In 1935, I received a letter from my uncle, Ru Kang, saying that Mr. Chen had written from Moscow, stating that the Sino-Japanese Incident was bound to happen, and we should try to prevent it, and there were various plans, which need not be said. At the same time, he also blamed me, saying that since the death of the President, I had become self-centered, like an unfaithful believer. Because I was blamed by him, I went to Hong Kong in 1936 to invite Mr. Tang Shaochuan, and not long after, the Southwest Political Affairs Council was abolished."</p>
<p>Regarding this record, I must clearly state that Mr. Chen did not have the various plans that Mr. Wu mentioned at the time, nor did he have, let alone have the possibility of any action to prevent the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident. In 1935, Mr. Chen did not go to Moscow; he was in exile in Paris. Even if Mr. Chen had a plan at the time, he would not indirectly consult Mr. Wu Chengyu, let alone blame Mr. Wu for "becoming self-centered since the death of the President," because Mr. Chen did not have Mr. Wu Chengyu's name in his mind at the time.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, Mr. Wu said: "...After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Mr. Chen came to Shanghai not long after and sent a letter inviting my uncle and me to Shanghai to meet and discuss the peace issue. He eagerly asked about Mr. Tang Shaochuan's situation at the time... From last year until now, I have been in Shanghai discussing with Mr. Chen about how to deal with the situation."</p>
<p>Regarding this record by Mr. Wu, I must solemnly state that Mr. Chen absolutely did not "send a letter" inviting Mr. Wu Chengyu or Mr. Wu's uncle, Wu Rukang, to Shanghai to meet after he came to Shanghai this time. Mr. Wu Chengyu came to see him on the recommendation of Wu Rukang, who wrote a letter that was entrusted to me by a Mr. Qian at the end of May last year to be passed on to Mr. Chen. Because the letter contained words that Mr. Chen did not want to hear, Mr. Chen ignored it. Mr. Qian visited a few times, but I never responded. Later, Mr. Wu Chengyu also came to my residence two or three times, asking me to make an appointment on his behalf. I also advised Mr. Chen a few times. Finally, I persuaded him to "listen to the news," and he finally met Mr. Wu in August. That is how the meeting was arranged. It was certainly not "sending a letter to invite him to meet." Mr. Wu's description of recent events is so far from the truth; one can only imagine how far from the truth earlier matters would be.</p>
<p>When Mr. Wu came to see him this time, Mr. Qian came with him. Mr. Wu only reported some news and set out some "facts" about Mr. Tang Shaochuan's last year and a half. In addition, he also reported: "Mr. Wang wants to invite Mr. Chen to Nanjing to meet and discuss in detail." Mr. Chen would have given an appropriate reply to this sentence and stated: "Gongbo has been here recently but has not mentioned this matter." He then said a few words about the merits and demerits of Chinese history. That was the situation of the first meeting between Mr. Wu Chengyu and Mr. Chen. Naturally, there was no "discussion," let alone "discussing the peace issue."</p>
<p>I still remember when Mr. Wu and Mr. Qian were leaving, Mr. Chen asked me, "What do you think of this chap?" and said: "I thought that Mr. Qian was Wu Chengyu. I didn't expect Rukang to have such an old nephew."</p>
<p>As for the so-called "discussing with Mr. Chen in Shanghai about how to deal with the situation," I must also responsibly state that Mr. Chen always talked casually with any visitor about the future of China. However, he never discussed with anyone about "how to deal with the situation." The future of China is a broad issue, while "how to deal with the situation" is specific. These two cannot be compared. At the same time, casual talk and "discussing" are two fundamentally different things. Perhaps Mr. Wu intended to "discuss," but Mr. Chen had no such intention. I remember that once, Mr. Wu came to see him with an old gentleman who claimed to be very familiar with Generals Li Delin and Zi Jiansheng. Mr. Wu raised the so-called "opening up a third situation" issue. Mr. Chen solemnly said to me at the time: "Please make them understand that I am absolutely not interested in this kind of issue. The problem of China from now on is a problem of a modern country." I immediately translated these words. Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen only met a few times in total. There was not much friendship, let alone plotting "schemes."</p>
<p>The above three points are related to Mr. Chen's political relations and actions. For the sake of historical accuracy, I have no choice but to make corrections. Because every event recorded by Mr. Wu involves himself, I have no choice but to involve Mr. Wu in order to correct the facts. This is something I cannot avoid.</p>
<p>Six</p>
<p>Finally, I want to explain two points: First, I am writing this article, partly to recount Mr. Chen's passing from illness to death, and partly to recount his words and deeds in his later years. My sorrow is still strong, so I cannot avoid bringing some emotions with me. However, I will never exaggerate the facts because of my emotions. To speak frankly, I still feel sorry for Mr. Chen. I have not written out the facts of his later years that were worthy of tears and songs, nor have I recounted his past achievements.</p>
<p>Second, but I have roughly written out his character. As long as he has his character, his grand aspirations, and his learning and insightful thinking, he will naturally have his righteous deeds and achievements. Just as bees brewing honey, there will be an inevitable and natural outcome. Even if Mr. Chen does not express anything, I still believe that his character is worthy of our deep thought, and especially can serve as an example for our nation, which is prematurely aging in youth and prematurely aging in middle age, from now on. Mr. Chen started his new life at the age of thirty-seven. From then until his death, he was always vigorous, always actively moving forward, and always strong and unyielding in advancing and fighting. I must tell the young people that in order to blaze a bloody path for the country in the future and to establish a brand-new, modern China, this is a necessary and indispensable character. "Work and Create" is the motto that Mr. Chen practiced throughout his life. I must tell the young people that if Mr. Chen could speak to you in his last minute, I believe that he would definitely dedicate this motto to you very solemnly and sincerely.</p>
<p>Constantly strive to "work"! Constantly strive to "create"! Mr. Chen has always been counting on you. Mr. Chen is always looking forward to you, China's brave and resolute youth! (The End) Written on July 2 at You Suo Bu Wei Zhai in Shanghai.</p>

From the Allied nations, Shanghai Garrison Commander Major General Arita and Communication Minister Lieutenant Colonel Noutani, among other guests, were present, making it a grand occasion. The ceremony was very solemn. First, the camp commander, Mr. Liu Chun, reported on the training situation, followed by speeches by Commander Chen, Section Chief Xiong, Major General Arita, and Lieutenant Colonel Noutani. The ceremony concluded at 11 AM. The entire group took a photo to commemorate the event. The report by the camp commander and the speech by the commander are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Commander's Speech</p>
<p>Distinguished guests, esteemed officials, and trainees: Today is the day of the supplementary opening ceremony of the Shanghai Special Municipal Security Brigade Cadre Training Camp. Why do we need to establish this training organization, and what is the purpose of our training? The camp commander has already reported in detail. The focus of this training is on spiritual cultivation, so the academic subjects are very simple, and the time is very short. Because all of you comrades who are training here have already received strict military training, this re-training is to make you spiritually stronger. I know that you have a spirit of hard work and endurance, but in reality, you often cannot resist the pressure of the environment, and your will is shaken. Therefore, it is necessary to gather you together for training so that you can receive some spiritual training and make your thinking more sound. The situation in Shanghai has always been complex. Because the general public does not have a clear understanding, the morale of the people is low. Now, I will use the simplest words to tell you that wealthy people only know how to spend passively and do not know how to produce actively, and people without money exhaust their minds to seek unjust wealth. Everyone thinks that the country is in a bad situation, so they do not know how to cheer up, resulting in moral decline. This situation is even more obvious after the Incident. Since the National Government returned to the capital, we should not be decadent. We should correct our thinking, abandon individualism, and take the nation and the people as the major premise to shoulder the great mission of organizing the people, revitalizing China, and defending East Asia. Because only by developing the power of the people can we revitalize China, and only by revitalizing China can we start again to defend East Asia. This is the only way our future will have hope. If the country's future has hope, then the individual's future will also have hope. Therefore, I deeply hope that the comrades in the cadre training camp can all recognize the goal and plan for the future of the country. Under the leadership of Supreme Leader Chairman Wang, we will engage in the peace and reconstruction movement. If you can follow my words, then this training will be meaningful. Today, I am simply presenting the significance of the training and talking to you about it. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will also talk to you about the issue of observing discipline. That is all.</p>
<p>Camp Commander's Report</p>
<p>Commander, Section Chief, distinguished guests, esteemed officials, and students: The training camp started training on July 1st, and today we are holding a supplementary opening ceremony. Now, I will briefly report on the training situation: The purpose of establishing the cadre training camp is to strengthen the unity of cadres at all levels of the Security Brigade, strengthen their beliefs, enhance their military and political knowledge, and cultivate a spirit of hard work and endurance in order to fulfill the mission of securing the local area. Training content: The training camp is divided into four phases, each lasting one month. Each phase will train 1% of the Security Brigade's cadres from the city, from battalion commanders to platoon leaders. It is planned that all cadres will be trained in four phases. During the training period, all personnel below the camp commander wear soldiers' uniforms. The camp soldiers live a life of fourteen hours a day, starting at 5 AM, to match the reality of hard work and endurance. The training courses include: regular meetings, spiritual education, tactical lectures, course summaries, model order summaries, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, peace movement theory, international situation, Pan-Asianism, speaker practice, group discussions, symposiums, and study tours. There are also technical courses, rifle and light machine gun shooting education, knife drills, technical education, leadership, and political courses, all taught by specialized personnel. Mr. Liu Yangshan taught Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings, Mr. Wu Songqun taught the international situation, Mr. Liang Xiuyu taught the peace movement theory, and Mr. Zhou Huaru taught Pan-Asianism. We are very grateful to all the instructors for their enthusiastic teaching. Our camp has a heavy task, but the training time is short, resulting in many shortcomings. We hope that all officials and guests will provide guidance. We are extremely grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Construction of Dormitories in the Vagrant Labor Camp is Underway, the Board of Directors Held its Second Meeting <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp has been in preparation for only one month, but due to the support of all parties, the progress has been quite smooth. The camp site and funds have been largely settled. The second board meeting was held yesterday, attended by Chairman Ding Mocun, Vice Chairman Wu Songqun, Directors Li Minhao, Chen Binzhu, Lin Kanghou, Xiang Kangyuan, Su Chengde, Tang Haian, Pan Sanxing, Zhang Kechang, Zhou Yuying, and others. Chairman Ding presided over the meeting and made a report, and discussed the future progress in detail. The meeting's proceedings are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Meeting Minutes</p>
<p>(A) Reporting Matters: Situation of Searching for Camp Site: The camp site has been designated by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government as the former site of the Training Camp and Model Prison. The two sites total about 500 acres, less than half a mile apart, suitable for 500 to 800 vagrants to cultivate. However, there are already residents cultivating there, about 50 households in the Training Camp and about 20 households in the Model Prison. It is currently planned to first take over the Training Camp. The residents who are already engaged in cultivation can be hired as workers in the camp, to prevent them from becoming displaced. Situation of Raising Opening Funds: As of July 5, the opening funds raised for the camp can be reported as follows: With the approval of the Executive Yuan, 10 million yuan was allocated from the surplus profit of the National General Association of Commerce and Industry's cotton cloth distribution for the camp's equipment. The Shen Bao newspaper has collected donations, which have reached over 500,000 yuan according to successive disclosures. The camp's preparatory office has collected and deposited about 300,000 yuan in the bank. Other firms and newspapers have collected donations, but have not yet notified the preparatory office. We are currently contacting and urging them. Situation of Establishing the Preparatory Office: Since the end of May, the Department of Social Welfare and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government have jointly appointed directors and assigned a preparatory director. The preparatory office was established on June 1 at No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yu Road, telephone 32419. The office is the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Social Enterprise Association, temporarily borrowed. A part of it is rented housing. All office staff are also borrowed from the Department of Social Welfare to save expenses. When the office is formally established, staff will be hired on a full-time basis. Currently, the necessary employee subsidies, printing paper, stationery, and transportation expenses are all paid according to actual costs, about 50,000 yuan per month. (B) Discussion Matters: All camp construction, supplies, and clothing must be planned according to the number of residents, and a budget must be made. It is proposed to first decide on the number of residents for the first phase. Resolution: It was decided to first accommodate 1,000 people in the first phase, and then gradually expand and increase the number of residents. Camp drawings have been completed. Are they feasible? Please vote. Resolution: The drawings were approved. For the camp's building materials and construction, (Type A) slightly superior materials would cost 35,345,000 yuan, while (Type B) inferior materials would cost 16,267,000 yuan. Which materials should be used? Please vote. Resolution: It was decided to use Type B materials. The prices of building materials are constantly increasing. Should the materials needed for the camp be contracted to a construction company, or should a material purchasing committee be set up to purchase the materials immediately? Please vote. Resolution: It was resolved to contract both the construction and materials to a construction company. The deadline for soliciting opening funds was originally the end of June, but it coincided with the end of the accounting period, so there was no active urging. How should this be carried out in the future? Please vote. Resolution: It was resolved to ask the newspapers to promote the camp and ask the stores, companies, firms, factories, and plants to voluntarily donate according to the previously determined method in July. If they do not deliver the funds in July, the preparatory committee will urge each industry association. (C) Temporary Motions: How should the 10 million yuan allocated by the General Association of Commerce and Industry for equipment be kept? Resolution: It was decided to appoint Directors Lin Kanghou and Xiang Kangyuan to be in charge of the safekeeping. How should the bidding for the camp's construction materials and labor be conducted? Resolution: It was decided that the directors would introduce construction companies, and Directors Lin Kanghou and Pan Sanxing would be asked to talk with the construction companies in advance, with the principle of giving priority to public welfare and submitting bids at low prices.</p>

<p>The city's anti-smoking campaign has reached a critical stage. Many smokers in various districts have gone to the police station to register, and smoking cessation permits have begun to be issued. Personnel have been dispatched to Nanshi several times to inspect the area. The situation in that area is quite good. All smoking and selling places have complied with the order to close. The deadline for smoker registration is approaching. It is hoped that smokers in the city will complete the registration procedures as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e36">The Municipal Government is Preparing to Expand the Municipal Library <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is a commercial and cultural center. A large-scale library is essential. The original municipal library building in the city center was severely damaged after the Incident and is difficult to restore. Although there is no shortage of book collections organized by other groups, students, or individuals, they are all small in scale and insufficient to meet the needs of the majority of citizens. Mayor Chen is aware of this and has a plan to restore the municipal library. As the location of the existing municipal public library in one district is suitable, the municipal government plans to reorganize and greatly expand the library, and the district office has appointed library experts Huang Peikun and Sun Xinpan as director and deputy director, respectively, to take over the task last month and actively prepare for all expansion matters. It is also planned to organize a library committee. In addition to Mayor Chen, Director Wu, acting Director of the Education Bureau Lin Jiongan, and Tan Tiankai, a member of the municipal government, as ex officio members, it is also planned to invite Chen Binzhu, Li Zeshi, Ding Fu, Bao Yegongchuo, Mo Guoqiang, Zhang Sumin, Shen Siliang, Zhu Boquan, Zhao Jinxiang, Zhao Zhengping, Wu Jun, Li Zanhou, Yan Junren, Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lirui, and other seventeen people as library committee members. Other facilities are currently under active development.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Brief News <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Rugao Fellow Villagers' Student Loan - The Rugao, Tongzhou, Chongming, and Qidong natives' association in Shanghai, in light of rising tuition fees and the loss of schooling for many outstanding young people from poor families, has set up a pilot student loan group. Applications are open from the third grade of elementary school to all levels of junior high school, senior high school, and university. Outstanding children from poor families who are Rugao natives in Shanghai can apply to the association's office at No. 29, 4th Floor, Shangye University, Beijing Road. After passing the review, an examination will be scheduled.</p>
<p>Anhui Natives' Association Continues to Offer Student Loans - The construction of all the primary and secondary school buildings for Anhui natives in Shanghai, which was started by the Anhui natives' association in Shanghai, has not yet been completed, and therefore has not been able to open on schedule, greatly affecting the studies of the children of poor families. After a meeting of the standing committee, the association decided to allocate a large amount of funds to continue offering student loans in the fall. Poor children who are natives of Anhui can apply for a loan from the association, and the procedure is very simple.</p>
<p>Eighth District Party Headquarters Relocates - The original address of the Shanghai Special Municipal Eighth District Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang was insufficient for its needs and has been relocated to 375 Taishan Road for office use.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Bayer Cross Trademark Dispute - Bayer pharmaceuticals are well-known throughout the world for their unique efficacy. Its BAYER cross trademark has also been legally registered in China for a long time. Previously, Iranian national Khachar Kohbin used the Bolje ACA cross trademark on similar products, causing a dispute. After repeated review by the Trademark Office and a final decision by the Ministry of Industry's administrative review, it was determined that the design and structure of the ACA trademark were similar, and the use was illegal. Therefore, it has been ruled to be revoked.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Review of Rice and Grain Problems in Various Regions - Continued from June 23rd of This Newspaper - The Impact of New Rice and Grain Measures <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>To resolve the severe Shanghai rice and grain problem since May, an announcement was made on the 25th to remove rice from the list of goods restricted from being moved to the Shanghai area under Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement. Simultaneously, temporary measures for the food rice of the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai were promulgated. According to the Temporary Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement, abolishing restrictions on the movement of rice and grain is not a temporary measure but can be seen as a fundamental revision of rice and grain control. Based on this fundamental revision, a temporary "Temporary Outline" was promulgated, adopting a long-term policy of permitting the free movement of rice and grain in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing. Everyone believes this measure is a wise adaptation to the new situation. However, this new policy has a significant impact on various provinces and counties, especially in Jiangsu province, where the unrestricted outflow of rice to Shanghai is feared to cause public panic within the counties. Therefore, all have explicitly strengthened restrictions on movement, focusing on stabilizing rice prices and ensuring the county's rice supply. The specific situation was briefly reported from Songjiang and Suzhou earlier. Among the countermeasures of various counties seen and heard by the reporter, Songjiang, Changshu, Wuxian, Wujin, Danyang, and other counties have all expressed their insistence on maintaining restrictions on the movement of rice and grain as before.</p>
<p>Many county governments are exerting all their efforts to maintain the people's food rice in their respective counties, just like the Shanghai municipal government is dedicated to solving the food problem of Shanghai citizens. They are implementing measures such as severely punishing smugglers and unscrupulous rice merchants, registering rice warehouses, restricting the amount of rice purchased by county residents, determining the highest market price, prohibiting transfer outside the county, and encouraging transfer into the county.</p>
<p>A certain county once stated: "In the unlikely event that the Shanghai municipal government adopts a policy of sacrificing the people of other counties for the sake of Shanghai citizens, we will have no choice but to more forcefully exercise emergency self-defense measures." In fact, the masses are unable to transport rice to Shanghai on the Hainan line train. Of course, policies that hinder the transportation of rice and grain with official passports from the rice control association will absolutely not be adopted. The temporary phenomenon seen among rice merchants in Songjiang cannot be seen in other counties. Therefore, the removal of rice and grain without official passports is strictly prohibited, while the removal of rice and grain to major consumption cities within the county without official passports is not prohibited, except for hoarding rice. This encourages the movement of rice within the county.</p>
<p>Such new rice and grain measures, on the one hand, further strengthen restrictions on movement outside the county, and on the other hand, tend to help ease restrictions on movement within the county. Various districts under the counties have adopted measures to strengthen control based on each district as a unit. The purpose of this measure was originally to abolish restrictions on the entry and exit of Shanghai, the largest consumer city, and to achieve stable rice prices. However, we feel that it is moving in the opposite direction. These control methods are called county-unit rice and grain autonomous control, but "smuggling" is still rampant, and black markets exist outside the county or district's "official prices." The state before the new measures has not changed in any way. Some people are unwilling to criticize the national government or various county governments from a legal theoretical standpoint. The rice problem during the period when the green crops are not yet ripe is truly too important and should not be primarily based on legal theory. Also, the issue of the absolute amount of rice in each county is avoided at this time. According to the example reported by Jiangsu Daily, the Changshu county magistrate requested that the provincial government rice control association should stop purchasing to alleviate the rice panic within the county. The reporter does not believe that the past purchasing performance of the rice control association will further deepen the phenomenon of insufficient rice, but what the county governments fear most is that the price disparity between Shanghai and various regions will cause the free movement of rice and grain to Shanghai without restriction. Therefore, the rice market prices in various counties will gradually rise to the Shanghai level, and as a result, the people's livelihood problems in the counties will become more profound. In fact, if one considers that the prices in rural areas will rise to the same level as, or even higher than, the Shanghai market price before the new measures were announced, then the measures taken by the county governments cannot be entirely condemned as resistance to the central government.</p>
<p>The problem does not lie in the superficial measures. It is necessary to re-examine why the county governments resorted to these means. In our opinion, when changing policies based on several years of experience, adverse phenomena often occur that are contrary to the purpose of the policies. Therefore, it is not a change of policy but its innovation that is absolutely necessary. With innovation, the people's hearts can be stabilized. With the people's hearts stabilized, politics and economy can move towards stability. (To be continued) (Translated from the June 23rd Continental News)</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Japanese Army Exhibits a Moral Spirit - Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Hengyang Campaign <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The press department of the Allied Japanese Army in Shanghai held a regular press conference at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 12th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on South East Road, Bund, meeting with newly arrived Chinese journalists in the city. Press Minister Izubuchi arrived on time with Advisor Akahoshi, immediately giving a special explanation of the Japanese army's attack on Hengyang. He stated that in the Japanese army's operations in mainland China, they have consistently promoted the Eastern moral spirit. Finally, he pointed out that when the Japanese army started the Henan operation, the communist and Chongqing armies competed to slaughter each other. The following is a reading of Minister Izubuchi's speech:</p>
<p>Moral Spirit</p>
<p>Press Minister Izubuchi first revealed that the moral nature of the Japanese army's operations has been highly practiced in this mainland China operation, and is more thorough than any previous operation. When the Japanese army captured Luoyang and Changsha not long ago, they were willing to endure operational inconveniences and determined not to cause any disadvantage or damage to the Chinese people. Therefore, the morality of the Japanese army's operations has been fully practiced. The moral spirit emphasized in the recent Japanese army's attack on Hengyang is completely the same as the capture of Changsha and Luoyang. Therefore, this time the attack on Hengyang was launched with a moderate attitude, which is the Japanese army's consistent grasp of the operational morality. In addition to avoiding innocent civilians from suffering deeply from the war as much as possible, they also protect the surrounding farmland and crops from destruction. This is the Japanese army's greatest goal. Now, the Japanese army has the opportunity to control Hengyang, the forward base of the American air force in Chongqing, and also controls important transportation hubs. Hengyang city is heavily surrounded by the Japanese army, and the trapped Chongqing army is either self-destructing or surrendering. Therefore, the surrounded Chongqing army is really unable to escape the siege, and it is difficult to change the situation. Therefore, after the Japanese army has obtained these two important strongholds, from a moral point of view, it is determined to maintain local construction and care for the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Slaughter by Chongqing</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Chongqing Military Commission took the opportunity to spread false reports, boasting greatly, and Western reporters stationed in Chongqing colluded with them, feigning that the Chongqing army was extremely brave and falsely claiming that the defenses of Hengyang were solid, not hesitating to conceal the facts and deceive the public, no different from disturbing someone on their deathbed. In short, the Japanese army has a grasp on Hengyang, and under favorable conditions, can capture the entire Hengyang at any time. This point should be deeply recognized. In fact, the Chongqing side fundamentally cannot understand the morality of the Japanese army, nor can they recognize the operational goals, and they fully expose their barbaric attitude. Regarding their operational behavior, which is absurd and ridiculous, it must be exposed. When the Japanese army launched the Henan operation in early May this year, under the rapid offensive, they dealt a fatal blow to the Chongqing army's First War Zone Tang Enbo's troops. Unexpectedly, at that time, the Chongqing and communist armies entrenched in northern Hubei Province fought fiercely to compete for territory. More than 1,000 people were killed and injured on both sides. This unfortunate incident occurred on May 7th and 8th, at Dashan County, Hubei Province (near the border of Hunan Province on the east side of the Pinghan Railway). At that time, a part of the equipped Chongqing regular army and the Fourth Column of the Vanguard Army peeked at its intention. Initially, they attacked the Japanese army, and then they shot at the Fifth Column of the New Fourth Army, forcibly demanding that the communist army transfer its garrison. At that time, although they knew that the First War Zone troops had been defeated miserably, they did not immediately provide assistance. This kind of self-destructive attitude makes people doubt and speculate about their operational goals and war concepts even more.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Using Telephone Lines to Sound Alarms - Technician Unest Has Successfully Designed <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>On Civil Air Defense Day this month, the Shanghai Civil Air Defense Headquarters used underground telephone lines for the first time to sound alarms simultaneously. The sounds were uniform and resonated throughout the city, achieving excellent results. This was thanks to the authorities' planning, and especially to the painstaking efforts of Unest Teikichi, the chief of the mechanical department of the Shanghai Telephone Company, who completed this great project with a budget of less than 100,000 yuan in just ten days. This is truly fortunate. On the 9th of last month, the Shanghai Civil Air Defense Headquarters planned to unify the time for sounding alarms with sirens in the city. However, to control 18 sirens with one switch required a large amount of materials and equipment. At that time, it was estimated that 3.6 million yuan would be needed. Although the Civil Air Defense Headquarters knew that it was necessary to avoid sound during air raids, the project was too large to start. After Unest heard the news, he carefully studied countermeasures. Technically speaking, it is almost impossible to control a strong current with a weak current. However, Unest used his ingenuity and was finally able to invent a perfect method of application. He completed the design on June 23rd of this year, prepared the materials at the end of the month, and started the installation. Because of the urgency of the situation, he worked day and night to rush the construction, and completed everything by 6:00 AM on the 9th of this month. Due to the limited time, it was not tested, but after being put into use directly, it was unexpectedly effective, overcoming all obstacles. The main points of this device are to use the current of the telephone line to control the power switch of the siren with a relay. Japan had also tried to use the weak current of telephone lines in Tokyo to control the strong current of a 10-horsepower siren, but they also felt it was difficult. If there was a fault in the wire, the siren would sound spontaneously. Testing and repairing were extremely difficult and dangerous in many aspects. Unest's design this time divided the function of the relay into several stages, using the adjustment of the weak current to control the strong current, and all dangers were completely eliminated. Moreover, by using the existing equipment of the telephone company, the required labor cost was reduced to less than one thirty-sixth of the original estimate, and the project, which was scheduled to take half a year, was completed in just ten days. This is enough to promote the superiority of Japanese science. The Army Air Defense Command, in view of the excellent results, also plans to modify all sirens according to law. According to Unest, this device is very reliable. The function of the siren is not diminished, and the telephone exchange is not hindered. Moreover, because the siren power supply is isolated at that time, even if the telephone line is cut or becomes short-circuited, there is no danger of the siren sounding. Even if the siren malfunctions and cannot sound, it will only be limited to one siren or one group. This time, it was successful without testing, and it was fortunate to be similar. As for the relationship between the telephone company and the Civil Air Defense Headquarters, it should be handled in the same way as applying for special-purpose money. Furthermore, Mr. Wu Queyan of the Huashang Bank and other staff members provided a lot of assistance for this novel device, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Readers Helping Students News</p>
<h3 id="e41">Earnestly Requesting Readers to Rescue 5,000 Outstanding Young People <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The shortage of donations for this year's student aid fund has already been roughly reported. Regarding the urgent situation of impoverished students waiting for assistance, we respectfully inform the readers. It has been found that over 10,000 students were recommended by more than 700 universities, middle schools, and primary schools to apply this year. Our office has carefully reviewed each application, and those with slightly lower grades, relatively better family conditions, incomplete procedures, or who do not meet the grade level requirements have been eliminated first, removing three-tenths of them. Among the remaining 7,000 people, all are outstanding impoverished scholars from various schools, who should be approved in full as usual so that they can continue their studies. However, in terms of tuition fees for the next academic year, primary schools require more than 2,000 yuan, and universities require more than 10,000 yuan. This newspaper is unable to subsidize them in full. Because full subsidies would mean an average of 4,000 yuan per person for 7,000 people, which would require more than 28 million yuan. The current aid money is only slightly more than one-fourth of this amount. In other words, less than 2,000 of these 7,000 students can receive aid money, and there is no other way to follow except to abandon the remaining three-quarters, about 5,000 people. For the current plan, how should we promote it? Please do your best to donate from all walks of life. It would be a perfect solution if it exceeds this year's budget. Otherwise, more than 5,000 people will inevitably encounter the blow of being rejected and losing their studies, and the psychological pain they will suffer is self-evident. In summary, readers, please pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Special Aid Fund Regarding the nine "special aid funds" established by this newspaper in the previous session, since sending letters to solicit opinions from various donors, we have received five responses in recent days. The enthusiasm is commendable, and they are recorded as follows: Da Cheng Silk Factory The entire staff of Da Cheng Factory wrote: "Our factory formulated six articles for the special scholarship method on July 9th last year and sent them to your office. Article 6 stated that as long as our factory can maintain, we will continue to hold this scholarship. Seeing that your newspaper and gentlemen are determined to cultivate the foundation of the country, and have worked tirelessly to run around and call for poor students for many years, even in severe cold and hot weather, we are deeply moved and should work harder. Therefore, this year we are expanding the donation amount to 150,000 yuan, using 90,000 yuan as one share of aid money and 60,000 yuan specifically to reward the top five students in the preliminary high school and high school entrance examinations this year. We hope you can make a decision."</p>
<p>Bai Zhi Aid Fund Physician Chen Cunren, the organizer of the Bai Zhi Aid Fund, said, "The Bai Zhi Aid Fund subsidizes a total of 20 university students. Among them, the expenses of national universities are relatively small, with approximately 3,000 yuan per person for those with fewer expenses and more than 10,000 yuan per person for those with more expenses. A total of approximately 100,000 yuan is needed for 20 people. It should be allocated in accordance with the amount to support the students' studies."</p>
<p>Fu Sheng Aid Fund Mr. Yang Fusheng, the owner of Heming Shoe and Hat Store, generously donated 80,000 yuan yesterday. In addition to subsidizing 10 students from Danhua Elementary School, all the rest will be used for general aid funds.</p>
<p>Ting Xin Aid Fund Mr. Wang Tingxin, the organizer of the Ting Xin Aid Fund, said, "We subsidized 10 first-year junior high school students in the previous session. If they can pass the exam, we will still subsidize them in full this year. If there are any unqualified students, we will choose others to replace them."</p>
<p>Yu Wen Aid Fund Mr. Zhang Yuwen of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company wrote: "Our company will continue to subsidize according to the number of people in the previous session. As for the amount of aid money, we will pay it after receiving instructions."</p>

<p>No matter how many incendiary bombs fall, they must be extinguished to the point where not even one remains. It is most essential to defend one's home with this kind of air raid victory belief and responsibility. But sometimes not only incendiary bombs, but also bombs fall together. If you are not careful and place your body in a high place or go outside, you will suffer completely useless harm due to bomb fragments. Therefore, when you see incendiary bombs or hear anti-aircraft guns and there is a danger of bombing, after being notified by the protection and surveillance personnel, except for those who are assigned to air defense, you should immediately take refuge in a suitable nearby place to avoid temporary danger. When bombs and incendiary bombs fall on your home and service place, you should immediately dispatch and start rescue activities.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking refuge is not only escaping, but also waiting for an opportunity to act in order to avoid unnecessary harm during the active defense activities.</p>
<p>It is also quite effective to lie down and assume a low posture when taking refuge, but each family and each workplace should preferably prepare a shelter. When there is no existing equipment, when building a new shelter, you can refer to the following construction essentials for air raid shelters.</p>

<h3 id="e49">On the Theory of Proportional Profit Distribution <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qikun</p>
<p>—Adjustment of Salary System—</p>
<p>In recent times, the cost of everything has risen, causing hardship for those who live on salaries. Although they receive wages and subsidies, in reality, their income often falls short of their expenses. Even if salaries and subsidies occasionally increase gradually, they pale in comparison to the soaring prices. This situation is known to all, young and old, and its consequences may lead to the complete collapse of the middle class, which constitutes the majority of society. At that point, the gap between rich and poor will widen to extremes, and the entire economic structure may face bankruptcy. Therefore, the theory of proportional profit distribution is proposed.</p>
<p>Proportional profit distribution means that the net operating profit earned by a certain enterprise during a specific period is distributed proportionally between labor and capital. This approach is very fair from a moral standpoint. The generation of net operating profit in an enterprise relies on the investment and effective management of managers or trustees. However, without the dedicated efforts of the labor force, capital would have no way to generate profit. Furthermore, the increase or decrease in profit fluctuates with the rise and fall of prices, which in other words, rises and falls with the rise and fall of living standards. This is more convenient than a subsidy system and eliminates the hassle of constant adjustments. Therefore, the implementation of proportional profit distribution is based on the principle of sharing prosperity and equal rights and obligations and supplements the inadequacies of the subsidy system. Hence, employees' salaries should be paid as before, and subsidies should be abolished accordingly.</p>
<p>The implementation of the theory of proportional profit distribution varies depending on the organizational structure of the enterprise. Now, let's discuss it separately:</p>
<p>For sole proprietorships and partnerships, the accountant calculates the gross monthly profit from sales each month, deducts various expenses (including salaries and taxes), and arrives at the net profit. The owner or partners may withdraw a certain amount of money during the period as a preliminary profit withdrawal, which will be deducted during profit distribution. Therefore, this amount should be included in the net profit account. Then, the net profit is distributed to labor and capital in a ratio of 3 to 7. The labor's share is then allocated proportionally based on the rank of each worker. The details vary depending on the specific industry and are omitted here.</p>
<p>The company organization is the same as described above. First, calculate the gross profit for the period, deduct expenses, and further deduct dividends, statutory reserve funds, and bad debt accounts. Then distribute according to the ratio of 3 to 7.</p>
<p>However, if an enterprise unfortunately experiences sluggish production and sales and no net profit is generated, the enterprise should provide employees with a subsidy equal to 15% of the average monthly net profit of the past year. This subsidy will be treated as a prepayment of expenses and amortized in installments when business improves.</p>
<p>As for year-end bonuses and dividends, they should be rationally distributed again.</p>
<p>The method of proportional profit distribution is roughly as described above. In addition to the aforementioned moral perspective and the supplementing of the subsidy system, its benefits also include the following:</p>
<p>Benefits to the capital side: Because the prosperity or decline of the enterprise's business directly or indirectly affects the income of the labor side, the labor side will spare no effort to improve work efficiency, promote business development, and understand each other because of shared interests and avoid unfortunate events such as strikes.</p>
<p>Benefits to the labor side: After the implementation of the theory of proportional profit distribution, the lowest limit of living can be maintained at least, given today's situation.</p>
<p>Benefits to society and the nation: The stability of the lives of general salary earners can promote social progress and prosperity, bring production and consumption into normalcy, enable educational and charitable public welfare undertakings to develop their efficiency, and gradually reduce labor-capital disputes to zero. Most importantly, the implementation of the profit distribution theory will require employees to take a serious attitude to monitor the capital side's handling of finances, which will help the national tax authorities. The omission of income tax and special consumption tax will be sharply reduced accordingly.</p>
<p>The theory of proportional profit distribution is roughly as described above, and still needs to be explored by social progressives and guided by industry leaders. Then, salaries earners will be fortunate. (Moving Rewards for Study)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Opinions on the Levy of Baojia Expenses <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liliao</p>
<p>The July 6th newspaper reported that "The Baojia Office will implement the unified collection of Baojia expenses starting this month." The content roughly stated that "In the past, the Baojia collected Baojia expenses, which mostly followed legal regulations. However, in order to meet urgent needs, some even created other items and collected fees without authorization. In order to rectify the collection of fees, a police station has formulated a unified method for collecting Baojia expenses, which will be implemented starting on July 1st of this year." I live on Changping Road, which belongs to Jiangning District. The Baojia expenses in this district have been collected from the heads of households to the supplementary households since June of this year, and a receipt from the Baojia district is given. However, I have the following opinions regarding the collection of Baojia expenses:</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that Baojia expenses would be implemented on July 1st, so the expenses paid by each household in June should be transferred to July. In other words, those who have already paid the Baojia expenses for June do not need to pay them again in July.</p>
<p>The regulations on the amount of Baojia expenses collected should be based on the number of people in the household (or the method of the Baojia district is already like this). The collection grades must be clearly announced so that every household knows, so as to achieve the purpose of actual collection and actual resolution.</p>
<p>The receipt number for the Baojia expenses I paid in June was originally printed with the amount of 5 national currency dollars, and then stamped with a 10-dollar stamp on top, which means that the collection was based on the stamped amount. The most important thing on each receipt is the number (especially for the micro-collection agency). If the number can be arbitrarily altered, abuses will occur. Moreover, the handling of this expense involves many hands, so it is advisable not to change the number. If it is necessary to change the collection rate due to factual constraints, in order to save material resources, the original receipt can be modified and used, but it should also have sufficient evidence to prove the reason for the modification, and a public notice should be made to show great faith.</p>
<p>I hope that the Baojia District will clarify and investigate whether the above three points are appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Educational Groups in the City are Facing Extreme Difficulties, the Food Supply for Five Thousand Children is in Question <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>There are 39 educational groups in this city, accommodating a total of approximately 5,000 children or more. Recently, due to soaring prices and a sharp increase in various expenses, while donations have significantly decreased compared to the past, maintaining operations has become extremely difficult. The most challenging aspect is the food supply. Since the city discontinued the rice ration for households, the threat to the children's lives in various groups has intensified. Through the efforts of the authorities, a monthly ration of special rice continues to be provided, but the amount required is still significant. If they want to purchase black market rice, they are limited by funds and cannot afford it. Therefore, they have no choice but to supplement the rice by mixing it with miscellaneous grains.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Liao Bingnan, an executive of the China Children's Welfare Association, apart from a portion of children's groups that can still maintain one meal with rice and two with porridge or one meal with rice and one with porridge, most other groups use thin porridge for all three meals a day. Except for a small amount of white sugar added to the lunch, all three meals, morning and night, are filled with miscellaneous grains such as wheat, red beans, and dried yams. According to the current situation, the minimum monthly food cost per child must be over 1,000 yuan. The cost has increased more than threefold compared to the end of last year, while the quantity and quality of nutrition currently obtained by the children are worse than before. Therefore, it inevitably has a considerable impact on the improvement of children's health. In addition to this material difficulty, it is truly difficult to maintain the minimum education and upbringing of these children. We deeply hope that enthusiastic women and gentlemen in society will generously give benevolence and provide a steady stream of assistance so that the work of various educational groups will not decline due to economic exhaustion. Then the benefit to thousands of orphans will be extraordinary.</p>

Furthermore, Mr. Chen Tianyu, the principal of Hualian Middle School, in order to integrate school education with society, intends to organize a simple business course to cultivate general middle school graduates.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Navy <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwa Toyoo</p>
<p>Sakura and Paving Stones (7)</p>
<p>From Tokyo, taking an ordinary express train at 11 pm can reach Wu Town by 4:30 pm the next day.</p>
<p>Longfu took this train. He thought that this train must be very empty, but the opposite was true, it was very crowded.</p>
<p>Because it was a very late night train, as soon as the train started, the passengers immediately began to sleep. It is a very interesting thing to be able to fall asleep sweetly in a narrow seat where you can't even move.</p>
<p>Longfu couldn't sleep anyway. The train's noise reminded Longfu of the scene when he went to Beijing, and it made him think about the changes in his mood before returning home this time.</p>
<p>(Human resistance has varying degrees. At the same time, human desires are as stubborn as wildfires that cannot be extinguished.)</p>
<p>He couldn't help but think that his naval enthusiasm occurred long before Makoto's.</p>
<p>On a short early summer night, he saw the faint dawn light near Guangchao again. Chu Fu hardly slept at all. When the morning sun rose gradually, Longfu started to get sleepy instead. Nagoya and Kyoto passed by in a dream.</p>
<p>Once on the Sanyo Line, Masato's face suddenly appeared in front of him. Yesterday afternoon, he had sent a telegram to ask about the arrival time, but could Masato, who is currently on duty, come to the station to meet him? If he doesn't come to pick him up, his warship must have set sail again. If that's the case, he will take the next train back home and come to Wu Town to visit again when he returns to Tokyo!</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking this, the inlet of the Seto Inland Sea appeared in the car window. Although the scenery is good from Itozaki to Wu Town for this hour and a half, it feels like time is passing too slowly.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Wu Town, there were countless people on the platform. When he came to visit at the age of sixteen, he got off the train with Makoto and felt very deserted, but now it was extremely crowded. In such a mixed crowd, he saw several naval officers. Longfu always thought it was Makoto, but he was wrong.</p>
<p>(In the end, Makoto must not be able to come.)</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking this, as soon as he walked out of the exit, someone came to tap his shoulder from behind.</p>
<p>"Are you here? I was in the second-class carriage in front."</p>
<p>The voice was very familiar. Just like the situation he encountered on the Ginza Avenue, it was Masato in a suit.</p>
<p>"I took the third-class carriage. You should know that." Longfu couldn't say much because he was too happy.</p>
<p>"You are already a painter, so I thought you would take second class. A poor lieutenant like me has to take first class, let alone you? Then come here! It's been very crowded lately."</p>
<p>Because Masato was already familiar with the place, he led the way through the crowds. (116)</p>

<p>The collection of goods is divided into ancient play parts (porcelain, copper, jade, stone, bamboo, wood, lacquer), calligraphy and painting parts (ancient books, modern paintings, oil books, watercolors, rubbings, books, couplets, central halls), ancient coin parts, stamp parts, bonsai are all parts, photography parts, etc. The collectors of calligraphy, painting and art in China have sent their collected treasures to the association in recent days, which is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>This office has received quite a few donations of bronze, stone carvings, calligraphy, rubbings, jade ware from major philanthropists in the past. After sorting them out yesterday, the tang fu (堂幅) with Xu Sangeng's clerical script, Lantian Shu's silk landscape, Xia Jingguan's painting plum blossom, Wu Guandai's Cai Zhi Yuan, Zheng Banqiao's running script, Tao Yisun's Shan Yong, and Liu Zhou's Pine Stone Hero Pingyuan map, are sent to the association to participate in the exhibition.
