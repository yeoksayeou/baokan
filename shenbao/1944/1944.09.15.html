<h3>女國民的努力</h3>
<p>日本政府於八月二十三日頒佈三敕令，一爲官員動員令，一爲學生勤勞令，一爲女子勤勞令，均自公佈日起實行。際此世界戰局進入決戰時期，要使戰力迅速增強，以對付敵人，予以最大的最後的一擊，使其殲滅，自不能不流底改換國內一切境象。女子挺身動勞令，更將過去一切指導獎勵的性質，改變成爲法令，又足鼓起一般女國民的勇氣，更足堅強全體性戰爭的實力。例如日本家庭婦女組織的飛機工作隊，足以表現女國民對於戰力的貢獻。（譯文見今日本報）　　人類集團生活以家庭爲起結　在家庭裹面，女子佔着比男子更重要的地位，她們的一切思想行爲，對於現在的構成份子，對於將來的子女，都有最大的影響，中國歷史上，敬姜的相夫興國，孟母的教子成名，最足表現良妻賢母的精神，其他類似的女子歷史，和聯帶的一切可歌可泣的母子夫婦的故事，深中人心，而可以影響到整個民族性。在這一方面，日本有着和我們同樣的東方民族精神，婦道的講習，良妻賢母的訓練，女國民們先要樹立起一個[爲國家奮鬥犧牲]的中心思想，隨後她們的一切作爲，都隨着這個方向進行，所以雖然在家裹做事，實在是替國家做一部份最重要的工作。至於不在家庭工作的女國民們，本年三月十八日決定強化女子挺身隊制度方策，目下又頒布敕令，即予實行，積極的使女國民從事於適合的工作，此後全國沒有一個閒暇的女子。把這種積極的精神去做建國的偉業，我們敢斷定，建國是沒有不成功的道理。　　反觀我國，數千年來的傳統精神幾乎被近百年來英美的自由思想破壞殆盡，特別在上海及其附近的都市，女國民們幾乎大都脫離了中國而成爲純粹英美化的了。太多數的女國民曉得用最新式的化妝品，曉得最穿時式的衣服，跳舞看戲打牌的頹廢生活，燙髪紅指紅　的裝束，眞是觸目皆然。這個流毒，使無數人力物力浪費，更使無定見無知識的人們跟隨着墜落，要說相夫，要說教子，這一批人那裹談得到，而況因爲妻子的虛榮浪費，或許無形中使其丈夫喪失意志，走入歧途，家破人亡，害國家，害民族，更爲有心人所不願說。　　我們以爲在大東亞戰爭發動以後，英美勢力消滅以後，有志的女國民們要挺身而出，領導一般婦女努力做復興的工作。要知道婦女地位之重要，就可以知道婦女工作影響的偉大，婦女們的努力可以鼓勵男子們的奮鬬，婦女們的努力可以訓練下一代子女的身心。婦女對於國家民族的關係如此之大，全國的女國民們更應該認爲天職而努力前進。在家庭裹，你們都愛護你們的丈夫，你們的子女，　樣愛護呢？只有工作，只有努力工作。在社會上，你們都愛護你們的團體，你們的國家，怎樣愛護呢？只有工作，只有努力工作。大家要做努力工作的國民，方纔對得起大時代裹的國家。</p>
<h3>日陸海軍航空隊八月份綜合戰果墜毀敵機合計八百十六架</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午五時發表：日本陸·海軍於八月中攻擊及邀擊敵機　空部隊所獲綜合戰果如次：○敵方損失，於本土西部擊落敵機二十八架，擊毀三架，均爲Ｂ２９型。於合灣方面擊落敵機四架，於中國方面擊落　機五十八架，使之中彈起火或擊毀者二百七十四架。南太平洋方面，擊落敵機百二十八架，中彈起火及擊毀者百六十六架。中太平洋方面，擊落敵機五十八，擊毀六十二架。北太平洋方面擊落敵機一架·擊毀五架，緬甸方面擊落十七架，中彈起炎者及擊毀者十六架。合計八百十六架。○日本損失，自炸及未歸返者二十七架，於地上損失三十三架，合計爲六十架。</p>
<h3>新幾內亞日軍依然堅持陣地</h3>
<p>南太平洋基地十四日中央社電　新幾內亞方面，前於四月下旬，自馬當地區轉進之日陸軍部隊，會於馬當與　伊答伯之中間地區，擊退優勢之敵軍，繼續西進，其後於阿伊答伯東方三十公里拉拉河右岸，至阿伊答伯各村落一帶海岸，以少數兵力與登陸之敵軍一師，目七月上旬起展開大攻擊，結果予敵重創，所獲戰果甚大。又於阿伊答伯一帶痛擊敵軍之日軍，除監視敵軍動靜外，更整理威瓦克，阿伊答伯間之兵力，靜待時機，其後敵軍漸次侵入薩爾密巴里奴火爾島，雙子島等地，進出於西部新幾內亞，企圖遮斷新幾內亞日軍之後方，日軍對此於威瓦克與阿伊答伯間已克服一切障碍，於山獄森林濕地帶之困難環境下，建成自給態勢，依然堅持陣地。又自四月下旬日軍自馬當轉進開始以來，至八月初旬，所收戰果如下：確認敵棄屍二千零七千九，敵傷亡二千六百五十，擊落飛機四十八架，擊毀四十五架，擊沉魚雷艇八艘，擊毀九艘，擊沉大型舟艇四艘，擊毀一艘，鹵獲及破壞戰車十五輛，經裝甲車二輛，卡車四十四輛，各種砲三十四門及其他武器彈葉多數。</p>
<h3>地方軍政一元化調整各機構人選經昨日最高國防會議通過</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　最高國防會議，於十四日舉行第五五次會議，討論事項：○主席交議，據行政院呈，爲本院第二二三次會議通過，財政部呈送修正蠶絲建設特捐暫行條例一案，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過，送國府公佈，並交立法院備查。○主席交議，擬調整行政軍事機構及人選，請公決案，決議通過，○主席交議，特派沈爾喬代表赴曲阜祭孔，決議通過。又調整行政軍事機構及人選一案內計：○兼署建設部部長陳君懸毌庸兼署，應免兼職。○特任傳式說爲建設部部長。○浙江省省長傳式說另有任用，應免本職。○特任項致莊爲浙江省省長。○駐蘇北靖綏主任兼第五集團軍總司令項致莊另有任用，應免本兼各職。○第五集團軍番號着即撤消。○蘇北民政事宜暫歸駐蘇北綏靖主任公署管理。○特派孫良誠爲駐蘇北綏靖主任。○註開封綏靖主任孫良誠另有任用，應免本職。○特派龐炳勛爲駐開封綏靖主任。○○設置駐蚌埠綏靖主任公署，並特派羅君強兼駐蚌埠綏靖主任。○○設置駐杭州綏靖主任公署，並特派項致莊兼駐杭州綏靖主任。　　南京十四日中央社電　國民政府當局鑒於大東亞戰爭已進至決戰階段，爲加強協力，以把握最後勝利起見，會計劃強化地方軍政機構，使協同一致，密切合作，以發揮全力，推進施政，而完成非常時期之地方決戰態勢。蓋近代戰爭，爲軍事政治經濟宣傳等棕合的總力戰，必須集結全國上下力量，加強協力，方能使戰爭有利於已方，而突破強敵。目前戰局瀕臨生死存亡之關頭，敵美企圖以中國大陸爲戰塲，呼號反攻，因此我們之加強地方決戰體制，以求適應新事態，乃爲我全國人民最關切之事。茲最高國防會議，於十四日會議中，業在各方期待下，通過調整地方軍政機構及人事之要案數件，其中最值我人注目者，爲添設駐蚌埠及駐杭州雨綏靖主任公署，并即分由皖浙兩省省長兼任綏靖主任，此在戰時體制下，就地方軍政一元運營而言，實爲賢明而確當之措置。由此而再觀駐武漢綏靖主任之由鄂省長兼任，駐徐州綏靖主任之由淮海省長兼任，在地方軍政施策上，已全面的完成一元運營體制。對於地方施政之推進，當可益趨圓滑順利，且以地方行政長官同時兼任當地軍事長官，則軍政協力，自亦必更爲緊密而有力。過去地方駐軍與當地政府間隔膜亦於此消除，至於孫良誠氏之調駐蘇北綏靖主任，及起用龐炳勛氏之任駐開封綏靖主任，以兩氏過去之經歷言，俱皆爲著名之優秀軍人。預料將來蘇北及豫中之治安，當可益致鞏固。最後應特別一提者，即浙省長傳式說氏之調任建設部長，當此戰時增產吃緊之時，傳氏以工學博士出長建部，可謂十分適任，今後之展其抱負，以貢獻於推進增產，推進建設事業者，實深堪期待也。</p>
<h3>日軍有力部隊突入桂省大結</h3>
<p>湖南空戰擊落美機　　日軍前綫十四日中央社電　日軍有力部隊，一舉突破北流湘江沿岸斷崖上之進路，九日下午越過省境，突進廣西，以該省北面要衝境前進三十公里，並突入大結（全縣前衛）。　　中國前綫某基地十四日中央社電　日軍航空隊，爲擊滅渝美空軍，連日來極爲活躍。十二日日機一部警戒湖南上空時，發現渝美機（Ｐ４０）型戰鬥機八架侵來，日機乘其即將遁走時，與之展開熾烈空戰，擊落三架，擊毀其四架，收得赫赫戰果。此役日機亦犧牲一架。</p>
<h3>日軍攻桂渝極恐慌</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝軍當局爲奪回衡陽，以取得美國信賴起見，特阻止日軍進攻廣西，並以二十師大軍集結於寶慶·祁陽·常寗·等地，期包圍衡陽，整備展開所謂攻勢防禦。據本日當地所得重慶電稱，日軍突破湖南廣西省境，已到達全縣（湘桂鐵路要衝，）予渝軍當局，及在渝美空軍以莫大威脅云。日軍自八月底發動攻勢以來，不久即擊潰所在渝軍，並以一日平均十五公里之驚奇速度，向前進攻，至四日已佔領常寗（渝新防禦綫之中心據點，）五日即佔領祁陽，七日遂攻陷零陵，至八日止更佔領東安·新寗·等地，一氣殺至湖南廣西省境。因而重慶當局之虛僞宣傳，及慘敗之事實，已暴露無遺，且避免發表。美國所最重視之湘桂鐵路沿綫戰況，路透社重慶十日電，亦會指明此點，謂美國以桂林爲中國西南部最大空軍基地，其重視該方面戰況，乃屬當然。前據合衆社重慶十日電稱·斯帝威爾司令部發表，觀駐渝美空軍轟炸湘桂鐵路要衝全縣之渡河點，並掩護該方面渝軍作戰之事實，可知日軍業已到達全縣·按全縣距桂林僅一百零四公里。又重慶軍事委員會最近發表日軍之位置係在東安，由此可知日軍已由東安向前進展四十公里云。目前重慶電報雖未發表日軍到達之狀況，總之由於日軍進攻廣西，已引起渝抗戰陣營之異常不安，今後其動向實堪注目。　　廣東十四日中央社電　湖電日軍精銳，突破湘桂省境，繼續向廣西省內進擊，已抵達防衛要衝全縣，渝軍甚爲狼狽。渝參謀總長白崇禧乃防衛桂林之最高責任者，數日來對戰局之重大及眼前之危機，至爲焦慮，刻與廣西派巨頭軍事參議院院長李濟琛，商討廣西全省之武裝計劃。居留桂林之美軍將校，已澈至內地。又全縣收容之渝軍傷兵，亦於日軍進擊前悉數移往貴州方面。</p>
<h3>龍陵方面日軍猛攻</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫十四日中央社電　怒江方面日軍，繼續壓迫龍陵方面渝軍，十一日晚日軍一部已突入龍陵東方二公里之高地，另一部已進抵龍陵東北三公里之老戶蛙附近。</p>
<h3>松井大將發表對東印聲明</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日本與亞總本部統理松井石根大將·十三日發表對東印度民衆聲明，其內容如次：此次日本議會之始，即聲明允許東印獨立，按東印民衆在荷蘭虐政下，歷三百四十年之久，此亦爲日本國民所同感痛憤者。大東亞戰爭勃發後，荷蘭勢力被除清，此正東印民族解放良機，當荷蘭屈服之時，日本政府即聲明，使印度納西亞爲印度納西亞人安居之處。去年六月，日本政府復聲明允許其參政，不久遂有中央參議院及各州特別市參議會之設立。此即東印獨立之第一部·爪哇方面前會展開民衆總力集中運動，今春四月又結成爪哇服務會五千萬民衆，崛起協力日本完遂大東亞戰爭，爲建設強力之新爪哇挺身奮鬥，增加生產，增強戰力，已有莫大之成績，蓋阻害東印民族獨立者，爲英美荷三國，然吾人已擊滅敵人，基礎益見鞏固，同時衷心期待強力向光榮獨立之途邁進。</p>
<h3>蘇軍突破華沙東南部</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德軍當局十三日發表：蘇軍以極有力部隊及機隊再度攻擊華沙，會突破該市之東南部，刻正與德軍激戰中。　　柏林十四日中央社電　德元首行營十三日發表：德軍已放棄東普魯士國境東方二十哩之浪沙要衝。　　柏林十四日中央社電　德國社訊，托爾布克興將軍第三烏克蘭前綫軍之先頭部隊，已越過羅多彼山之東部，而向色雷斯前進。蘇第六坦克車軍之強大編隊，現正經由南喀巴阡山進入達琅西里瓦尼亞盆地，該處戰爭在米爾許河北岸，已更見緊張，德洪軍已立下有利之山岳陣地·由該處作順利之防禦。</p>
<h3>英美蘇羅休戰約內容</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據莫斯科電·羅馬尼亞政府與英美蘇三國成立之停戰條約·已由羅馬尼亞代表巴特拉西諾氏·與反軸心軍方面代表·蘇軍第二烏克蘭戰綫軍司令馬利諾斯基元帥簽字。　　瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，英美蘇對羅馬尼亞之休戰條件，包括二十條，已由莫斯科無線電臺予以發表其要點如次，羅馬尼亞自願承認爲戰敗國，而以步兵十師團供蘇軍最高司令部之支配，以資與德國及其同盟國作戰，羅馬尼亞並擔任解除羅國領土內德軍之武裝，而拘禁之，羅馬尼亞政府負責運輸羅國境內之反軸心軍，並担任給養與醫藥之費用，此外，羅政府尚須釋放一切戰俘，並照顧彼等之返國。另一條件爲羅馬尼亞境所有德人之一切財產，均須加以沒收，同時蘇聯因戰爭所受之損失，須由羅馬尼亞負担之，以美金三萬萬元爲度。</p>
<h3>日本家庭婦女組織飛機工作隊發揮飛機增產的威力</h3>
<p>都下立川，是飛機的都市。每天在空中都是嗡嗡作響。在馬路上行走的人，到處都是槓着[立川飛機工作隊Ｘ中隊Ｘ分隊作業塲]的招牌。這一飛機工作隊，就是隨着飛機的發達而成長起來的立川市內蓬勃家庭工塲集團。只要想到這種工作隊是工塲主要的主力軍，而就可以想像到飛機的生產能率。在家庭內縫衣作飯的婦女，對於提高生產決定一國存亡的飛機方面，能夠發揮這樣大的威辦，這樣足可以證明全國的婦女，應當重視自己的偉大。在此處把[立川飛機工作隊]的戰門姿態介紹出來，以供其他[隣組]參加戰鬥生產的參考。</p>
<h3>誕生與相織</h3>
<p>工作隊本部在立川市曙町　在本部之下分五中隊（以町爲單位）四十分隊（以作業塲爲單位），這種分隊的工作雖約　二十名前後，而全部隊員爲七百五十餘名，百分之九十五爲家庭婦女，其餘爲五六十風以上的男人。　　這一大部隊作成的製品，在第二天就堆成山。這樣龐大的組織是怎樣形成的呢？就是去年十月，立川市高松町町會長土井留治一再苦心於提倡貯蓄的結果。當時就想，怎樣才能對軍需有幫助？於是想出這樣一個妙計，而會同佐藤副會長去商量立川飛機杉山工務課長，取得贊成後，便立刻開始準備。首先就把各町內比較有時間而且可靠的婦女，選出二十五名來，着手商是。這批人就是中隊長。把這批中隊長召集到一處，就從十一月起開始學習一個月的枝術。利用停歇的飯館　址，而工具則由工塲免費供給。　　於是就從十二月八日這一天開始，正月內就開辦了三個作業塲，二月就開辦了十三個，數目是在蒸蒸日上。服務時間是早晨八點到下午四點，現在業已有四十多處在從事生產着，因此飛機公司內○○名專門生產部分品的大工塲，完全就被家庭婦女們所代替，同時最近也能夠讓工作隊員從事生產更重要的部份了。　　工作地點不利用歇業的飯館和咖啡店，同時還有很多熱心家就把前廳和客廳讓出來，作工作塲所，逐漸工作得有了美滿的成效。現在對於不合格的製品差不多沒有了，這足證婦女特有的熱忱和謹愼。</p>
<h3>空房的担心</h3>
<p>此處的工作人員全都是看家的主婦，她們都需要照顧兒童，還要給丈夫作好飯送到服務機關去。再就是領戶口米，配給油等瑣碎事情，一天忙到晚，誰都堯得這已經成爲戰時下日本婦女的日常工作了。如不能解決這些問題，就不能去服務。於是以町會爲單位的各小隊隊員，輪流代領配，給品且派值班守家者嚴防偷盜。對於這樣小的事情都會經過周密的計畫，務使安心作工爲止。這一點辦的還算差強人意，但因配給不足和貪糧困難的今天，往往有根多曠工者，這自然在增產上有重重困難。配給問題，的確是一件令人頭痛的事。</p>
<h3>當局的幫助</h3>

<h3>隊員的熱誠</h3>
<p>自從開始服務以來，會經發生過太平洋上的大事變，例如庫埃慈林島及魯奧特島的日本將士，全部英勇犧牲。受到這種刺激，婦女會員們愈發羣情激昂，所以遠在小金井町的婦女也來踴躍參加。小金井日本婦人會支部長大久保操（五十三歲）的女兒，晉子（三十一歲），廣瀕篤郎陸軍上尉未亡人）和之喜惠（三十歲，福田克已航技中校未亡人）兩位女性，身邊都有無父的遺子，而竟令人感動地來申請加入立川大作塲，因此便成立了小金井分會。老母親把自己的貯藏室改造成作坊，由三月十日起正式開始工作。這一個分會，約有十個人。　　小金井分會成立不久，在七里之外的保谷村，也有一位丈夫爲國捐驅的寡婦，中山未亡人（二十一歲），一聽到這種消息，便立刻來參加，自從加入以來，每天騎腳踏車上班，從無一天間斷。</p>
<h3>土井隊長的話</h3>
<p>本部設有好多資料倉庫，希望有更多的人來參加。目前七百五十名隊員中·最近曠工比例爲百分之四十，這看起來是一個不好的現象。這由於家庭婦女每天忙於站排領米領油，費去整天工夫，所以只要配給不生毛病，總有好轉的一天。使用鍾和絞盤，這是婦女的特長，出品檢查所嚴密檢查的結果，不合格者幾乎是沒有的。立川在　有飛機公司這一點　　　　與其他地區不　　　　果關係當局以及中　　[日婦][鄰組]兩組織肯表示熱誠，則一定會有更大的成績。因此只有一點，不要令隊員担心無人守家，如果能作到這一步，我敢斷言，家庭工塲的力量，足能對抗相當大的工塲。我想，在這種嚴重時期，立川市也逐漸會更發達起來的。]（安譯自八月廿六日廣賣報知）</p>

<h3>防空本部勸導行人遵守交通規則</h3>
<p>避免發生不幸意外事件　　本市市民防空本部九月十四日發表文告，勸導行人務須遵守交通規則，在可能範圍內，在人行道上行走，倘無人行道，則應儘量靠近馬路左邊而行。查交通規則內，業經詳細規定，行人應沿馬路左邊人行道行走，但在現時情形之下，夜間馬路燈光爲適應防空需要起見，業已減至最小限度，摩托車輛之車前燈亦經遮暗，開車人殊難察見在馬路上，或甚至在馬路正中任意行走之人。倘值燈火熄滅之時，開車人更難矚見馬路中之行人，遇在迎面駛來之車輛時，開車人因黑暗關係，勢必全神貫注避免與來車相撞，此時馬路正中倘有行人，頗可有因不及察見，以致釀成意外事件之危險。鑒於上述各點，是以防空本部對於行人應嚴守上述之交通規則一層，殊覺有亟行喚起民衆注意之必要。防空本部同時復勸令人力車車夫，三輪車車夫，及乘坐腳踏車之人，爲其自身及乘客之安全起見，萬勿在馬路正中行駛，並呈乘客勸止車夫儘量靠近馬路左邊駛行，以免發生不幸之意外事件。</p>

        <h1>1944.09.15</h1>
<h3>Efforts of Female Citizens</h3>
<p>On August 23rd, the Japanese government promulgated three imperial edicts: one for official mobilization, one for student labor, and one for female labor, all effective from the date of promulgation. As the global war situation enters a decisive phase, in order to rapidly increase combat power to confront the enemy and deliver the greatest final blow to annihilate them, a thorough transformation of the domestic situation is necessary. The decree for women to step forward for labor has transformed the nature of past guidance and encouragement into law, further boosting the courage of female citizens and strengthening the overall war effort. For example, the airplane work teams organized by Japanese housewives demonstrate the contribution of female citizens to combat power. (Translation from today's Japanese newspaper)</p>
<p>Human group life begins with the family. Within the family, women occupy a more important position than men. Their thoughts and actions have the greatest impact on current members and future generations. In Chinese history, Lady Jing Jiang's assistance to her husband in governing the state and Mencius's mother's education of her son to achieve fame best exemplify the spirit of a virtuous wife and wise mother. Other similar historical examples of women, and the related touching stories of mothers, sons, and couples, are deeply ingrained in people's hearts and can influence the entire national character. In this respect, Japan shares the same Eastern national spirit with us. Lectures on feminine virtue, training for virtuous wives and wise mothers, and the establishment of a central idea of [struggling and sacrificing for the country] among female citizens are paramount. Subsequently, all their actions will follow this direction. Therefore, even working at home is actually doing a crucial part of the work for the country. As for female citizens who do not work in the home, a policy to strengthen the women's volunteer corps system was decided on March 18th of this year, and now an imperial edict has been promulgated to implement it immediately, actively engaging female citizens in suitable work. After this, there will be no idle women in the country. We dare to assert that if this proactive spirit is used to build a great nation, there is no reason why nation-building will not be successful.</p>
<p>In contrast, the traditional spirit of our country for thousands of years has been almost completely destroyed by the free thought of England and America in the past hundred years, especially in Shanghai and its surrounding cities, where most female citizens have almost detached themselves from China and become purely anglicized. Too many female citizens know how to use the latest cosmetics, wear the most fashionable clothes, and lead a decadent life of dancing, watching plays, and playing cards. The hairstyle and attire of permed hair and red fingernails are truly ubiquitous. This toxin wastes countless manpower and resources, and causes countless people with no fixed opinions or knowledge to follow and fall. When it comes to assisting their husbands and teaching their children, this group can't even begin to discuss it. Moreover, because of the vanity and extravagance of wives, their husbands may unknowingly lose their will, go astray, and suffer the destruction of their families, harming the country and the nation, something that conscientious people are unwilling to talk about.</p>
<p>We believe that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the elimination of British and American forces, patriotic female citizens should step forward and lead women in working hard for the cause of revitalization. Knowing the importance of women's status, we can understand the greatness of the impact of women's work. The efforts of women can encourage the struggles of men, and the efforts of women can train the minds and bodies of the next generation of children. Because the relationship between women and the country and nation is so great, female citizens across the country should regard it as their divine duty and strive forward. At home, you all love your husbands and your children. How should you love them? Only through work, only through hard work. In society, you all love your groups and your country. How should you love them? Only through work, only through hard work. Everyone should be hardworking citizens in order to be worthy of the nation in this great era.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive August Battle Results of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Corps: Total of 816 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops in New Guinea Still Holding Their Ground</h3>
<p>South Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In New Guinea, the Japanese army units that retreated from the Madang area in late April encountered and repelled superior enemy forces in the area between Madang and Aitape and continued westward. Subsequently, a small force engaged in a major offensive against a division of landing enemy forces from the right bank of the Lalla River, 30 kilometers east of Aitape, to the coast of the villages around Aitape, starting in early July. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses and the battle results were significant. In addition to monitoring enemy movements, the Japanese troops who severely attacked the enemy around Aitape are also consolidating the forces between Wewak and Aitape, awaiting opportunities. Later, the enemy gradually invaded Sarmi, Balinu, Huoer Island, and other places, advancing into western New Guinea in an attempt to cut off the rear of the Japanese troops in New Guinea. In response, the Japanese army has overcome all obstacles between Wewak and Aitape, built a self-sufficient position in the difficult environment of mountainous forests and wetlands, and continues to hold its ground. Since the Japanese army began retreating from Madang in late April, the battle results up to early August are as follows: 2,079 enemy bodies confirmed, 2,650 enemy casualties, 48 aircraft shot down, 45 destroyed, 8 torpedo boats sunk, 9 destroyed, 4 large boats sunk, 1 destroyed, 15 tanks captured and destroyed, 2 armored vehicles, 44 trucks, 34 cannons of various types, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition.</p>
<h3>Unification of Local Military and Political Affairs: Adjustment of Organizations and Personnel Approved by the Supreme National Defense Council Yesterday</h3>

In addition, the case of adjusting administrative and military organizations and personnel includes: ○ Chen Junxuan, concurrently Minister of Construction, no longer needs to serve concurrently and should be relieved of the concurrent post. ○ Special appointment of Chuan Shi Shuo as Minister of Construction. ○ Chuan Shi Shuo, Governor of Zhejiang Province, has other assignments and should be relieved of the current post. ○ Special appointment of Xiang Zhizhuang as Governor of Zhejiang Province. ○ Xiang Zhizhuang, Resident Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu and concurrently Commander-in-Chief of the 5th Army Group, has other assignments and should be relieved of both positions. ○ The designation of the 5th Army Group is hereby abolished. ○ Civil affairs in northern Jiangsu will temporarily be managed by the Office of the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu. ○ Special appointment of Sun Liangcheng as Resident Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu. ○ Sun Liangcheng, Resident Pacification Commissioner of Kaifeng, has other assignments and should be relieved of the current post. ○ Special appointment of Pang Bingxun as Resident Pacification Commissioner of Kaifeng. ○ The Office of the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Bengbu is established, and Luo Junqiang is specially appointed as the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Bengbu concurrently. ○ The Office of the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Hangzhou is established, and Xiang Zhizhuang is specially appointed as the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Hangzhou concurrently.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In view of the fact that the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive stage, the National Government authorities, in order to strengthen cooperation and seize the final victory, have planned to strengthen local military and political organizations to achieve unity, close cooperation, and exert full force to advance administration and complete the local decisive battle posture during this extraordinary period. Modern warfare is a comprehensive total war involving military, political, economic, and propaganda aspects. It is necessary to gather the strength of the entire country, strengthen cooperation, and make the war beneficial to our side in order to overcome strong enemies. The current war situation is on the verge of life and death, and the enemy United States attempts to use the Chinese mainland as a battlefield, calling for a counteroffensive. Therefore, strengthening our local decisive battle system to adapt to the new situation is of utmost concern to our people across the country. The Supreme National Defense Council, at its meeting on the 14th, approved several major cases on the adjustment of local military and political organizations and personnel under the expectations of all parties. Among them, the most noteworthy are the addition of the Offices of the Resident Pacification Commissioners of Bengbu and Hangzhou, which will be concurrently held by the governors of Anhui and Zhejiang provinces, respectively. In the wartime system, this is a wise and appropriate measure in terms of unified local military and political operations. From this perspective, the fact that the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Wuhan is concurrently held by the Governor of Hubei Province and the Resident Pacification Commissioner of Xuzhou is concurrently held by the Governor of Huaihai Province indicates that a unified operational system has been fully completed in local military and political policies. The advancement of local administration can be smoother and more successful, and since local administrative officials also concurrently serve as local military commanders, military and political cooperation will inevitably be closer and more powerful. The past estrangement between local stationed troops and local governments will also be eliminated. As for Sun Liangcheng's transfer to the post of Resident Pacification Commissioner of Northern Jiangsu and the appointment of Pang Bingxun as Resident Pacification Commissioner of Kaifeng, based on their past experiences, both are renowned and outstanding military figures. It is expected that the security of northern Jiangsu and central Henan will become more consolidated in the future. Finally, it should be specially mentioned that Chuan Shi Shuo, Governor of Zhejiang Province, has been transferred to the post of Minister of Construction. At this time of urgent wartime production increase, Chuan, with a doctorate in engineering, is very suitable for heading the Ministry of Construction. It is deeply expected that he will realize his ambitions and contribute to promoting production and construction in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Attack in Guangxi Province</h3>
<p>American Planes Shot Down in Hunan Air Battle</p>
<p>Japanese Front Line, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Powerful Japanese troops, at one stroke, broke through the road along the cliff of the Xiangjiang River in Beiliu, crossed the provincial border on the afternoon of the 9th, and advanced into Guangxi. They advanced 30 kilometers into the north of the province and also broke into Dajie (the vanguard of Quanxian County).</p>
<p>A Certain Base on the Chinese Front Line, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese air units have been very active in recent days to destroy the Chongqing-American air force. On the 12th, when a part of the Japanese aircraft was patrolling the airspace over Hunan, it discovered eight Chongqing-American aircraft (P-40 type fighters) invading. The Japanese aircraft took advantage of their imminent escape and engaged in a fierce air battle with them, shooting down three and destroying four, achieving remarkable results. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also sacrificed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Extremely Panicked by Japanese Attack on Guangxi</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report - In order to recapture Hengyang and gain the trust of the United States, the Chongqing military authorities are preventing the Japanese army from attacking Guangxi. 20 divisions of the army are massing in Baoqing, Qiyang, Changning, and other places, hoping to encircle Hengyang and prepare to launch a so-called offensive defense. According to a Chongqing telegram received locally today, the Japanese army has broken through the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border and has arrived at Quanxian County (a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway), posing a great threat to the Chongqing military authorities and the American air force in Chongqing. Since the Japanese army launched its offensive at the end of August, it quickly defeated the Chongqing army and advanced at an astonishing speed of 15 kilometers per day on average. By the 4th, it had occupied Changning (the central stronghold of the Chongqing new defense line), on the 5th it occupied Qiyang, on the 7th it captured Lingling, and by the 8th it had occupied Dong'an, Xinning, and other places, advancing all the way to the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border. As a result, the false propaganda of the Chongqing authorities and the facts of the disastrous defeat have been completely exposed and avoided publishing. Reuters Chongqing on the 10th pointed out that the United States attaches the greatest importance to the war situation along the Xiang-Gui Railway, stating that Guilin is the largest air force base in southwestern China. According to a United Press Chongqing dispatch on the 10th, the Stilwell Command announced that the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the crossing point in Quanxian County, a key point on the Xiang-Gui Railway, and covered the Chongqing army operating in that area. It can be seen that the Japanese army has already arrived at Quanxian. According to reports, Quanxian is only 104 kilometers away from Guilin. In addition, the Chongqing Military Commission recently announced that the position of the Japanese army is in Dong'an, from which it can be seen that the Japanese army has advanced 40 kilometers from Dong'an. Although Chongqing telegrams have not announced the arrival of the Japanese army, in short, the Japanese attack on Guangxi has caused abnormal anxiety in the Chongqing anti-Japanese camp, and its future movements are worth watching.</p>
<p>Guangdong, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The elite Japanese troops, who had broken through the Hunan-Guangxi provincial border, continued their attack into Guangxi Province and have reached Quanxian County, a key defense point. The Chongqing army is in a very difficult situation. Bai Chongxi, Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Army, is the highest responsible person for the defense of Guilin. He has been extremely anxious about the severity of the war situation and the imminent crisis in recent days and is discussing the armed plan for the entire Guangxi Province with Li Jishen, a military advisor to the Guangxi faction. American officers stationed in Guilin have been evacuated to the interior. In addition, all the wounded soldiers of the Chongqing army received in Quanxian were transferred to Guizhou before the Japanese army's attack.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Launch Fierce Attack in Longling Area</h3>

<h3>General Matsui Issues Statement on East Indies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - General Iwane Matsui, the head of the Japan-Asia Headquarters, issued a statement on the 13th to the people of the East Indies, the content of which is as follows: At the beginning of this Japanese parliament, it was stated that the independence of the East Indies would be allowed. For 340 years, the people of the East Indies have suffered under Dutch tyrannical rule, which is a pain and indignation shared by the Japanese people. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Dutch forces were eliminated, which is a good opportunity for the liberation of the East Indies. When the Netherlands surrendered, the Japanese government stated that it would make Indonesia a place for Indonesians to live in peace. In June of last year, the Japanese government declared that it would allow them to participate in politics, and soon the Central Advisory Council and special municipal councils of each state were established. This is the first step in the independence of the East Indies. Previously, Java launched a mass mobilization movement to concentrate its overall strength. In April of this year, the Java Service Association, with 50 million people, rose up to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War, striving to build a strong new Java, increasing production, and strengthening combat power, which has achieved great results. Those who hinder the independence of the East Indies are the three countries of England, America, and the Netherlands, but we have already defeated the enemy, and the foundation is becoming more and more solid. At the same time, we sincerely expect to move towards a strong and glorious independence.</p>

<h3>Contents of the Armistice Agreement Between England, America, Russia, and Romania</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch, the armistice agreement between the Romanian government and England, America, and Russia has been signed by Romanian representative Patrascinou and Marshal Malinovsky, commander of the Second Ukrainian Front of the Soviet Army, representing the anti-Axis powers.</p>

<h3>Japanese Housewives' Airplane Work Team Demonstrates the Power of Increased Airplane Production</h3>
<p>Tachikawa, in the capital, is a city of airplanes. The air is buzzing every day. People walking on the streets see signs everywhere that say [Tachikawa Airplane Work Team X Company X Platoon Workshop]. This airplane work team is the bustling group of home workshops in Tachikawa City that has grown with the development of airplanes. Just thinking about how this work team is the main force of the factory allows us to imagine the production efficiency of airplanes. Housewives who sew clothes and cook meals at home are able to exert such great power in the airplane sector, which determines a country's survival, which is enough to prove that women across the country should value their own greatness. Here, we introduce the battle posture of the [Tachikawa Airplane Work Team] as a reference for other [neighborhood associations] to participate in combat production.</p>
<h3>Birth and Organization</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the work team is located in Akebonocho, Tachikawa City. Under the headquarters are five companies (organized by town) and forty platoons (organized by workshop). Although the work of each platoon involves about 20 people, the total number of team members is more than 750, 95% of whom are housewives, and the rest are men over 50 or 60 years old.</p>
<p>The products made by this large unit are piled up like a mountain the next day. How was such a huge organization formed? It was the result of Mr. Doi Tomeji, chairman of the Takamatsucho Town Association in Tachikawa City, who repeatedly worked hard to promote savings last October. At that time, he thought, how can we help the military demand? So he came up with such a great plan, and after consulting with Vice-Chairman Sato, he consulted with Mr. Sugiyama, head of the Tachikawa Aircraft Industrial Affairs Section, and after obtaining approval, he immediately began preparations. First, 25 of the most reliable women who had more time in each town were selected to begin discussions. This group is the company commander. This group of company commanders was summoned to one place, and they began to learn the technology for one month starting in November. The site of a closed restaurant was used, and the tools were provided free of charge by the factory.</p>
<p>Thus, starting on December 8th, three workshops were opened in January, and thirteen were opened in February. The number was steadily increasing. The service time is from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Currently, there are more than 40 places engaged in production. Therefore, the large factory in the airplane company with ○○ skilled workers specializing in the production of parts has been completely replaced by housewives. Recently, it has also been possible to allow work team members to engage in the production of more important parts. Workplaces do not make use of closed restaurants and coffee shops. At the same time, many enthusiastic families have given up their front halls and living rooms for use as workplaces, gradually achieving satisfactory results. Now, there are almost no unqualified products, which proves the unique enthusiasm and caution of women.</p>
<h3>Concerns About Empty Houses</h3>
<p>All the workers here are housewives who take care of the house. They need to take care of their children and also prepare meals for their husbands to be sent to the service agencies. In addition, there are trivial matters such as receiving household rice and allocating oil. They are busy from morning to night. Everyone feels that this has become the daily work of Japanese women in wartime. If these problems cannot be solved, they cannot serve. Therefore, the members of each squad, organized by the town association, take turns to receive and distribute goods and send guards to protect the house from theft. Even small matters are carefully planned to ensure that they can work with peace of mind. This point is still fairly satisfactory, but due to insufficient allocation and the difficulty of obtaining food today, there are often many absentees, which naturally causes great difficulties in increasing production. The allocation problem is indeed a headache.</p>
<h3>Assistance from the Authorities</h3>
<p>The city government, the police station, and the mobilization office all understand the situation, so they are very helpful. Therefore, service personnel receive extra rations, and service personnel who are qualified for the volunteer corps are also relieved of their duties. The registration of service personnel will be implemented soon in order to provide special preferential treatment.</p>
<h3>Enthusiasm of Team Members</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of service, major events have occurred in the Pacific, such as the heroic sacrifice of all Japanese soldiers on Kwajalein and Roi-Namur Islands. Stimulated by this, the female members became more enthusiastic, so women as far away as Koganei Town also eagerly participated. Okubo Misao (53 years old), the branch director of the Japan Women's Association in Koganei, her daughter, Kinko (31 years old, widow of Lieutenant Atsuro Hirosawa of the Army), and Yoshie (30 years old, widow of Lieutenant Colonel Katsumi Fukuda of the Naval Aviation Technology Corps), both have fatherless orphans, and they surprisingly moved people by applying to join the Tachikawa workshop, so the Koganei branch was established. The old mother transformed her storage room into a workshop and officially started work on March 10th. There are about ten people in this branch.</p>
<p>Not long after the Koganei branch was established, a widow in Hoya Village, seven miles away, Mrs. Nakayama (21 years old), whose husband died for the country, immediately came to participate upon hearing the news. Since joining, she has been riding her bicycle to work every day without interruption.</p>
<h3>Words of Captain Doi</h3>
<p>The headquarters has many data warehouses, and we hope more people will participate. Currently, among the 750 team members, the absenteeism rate has recently reached 40%, which seems to be a negative phenomenon. This is because housewives are busy standing in line every day to receive rice and oil, spending the whole day. Therefore, as long as the distribution doesn't cause problems, there will be improvement one day. Using clocks and winches is a specialty of women. The rigorous inspection by the product inspection office results in almost no unqualified products. The fact that Tachikawa has an airplane company is different from other areas. If the relevant authorities, as well as the [Japanese Women] and [Neighborhood Group] organizations, show enthusiasm, there will surely be greater achievements. Therefore, there is only one thing: don't let the team members worry about no one guarding their homes. If this can be achieved, I dare say that the power of home factories can stand against fairly large factories. I think, in this critical period, Tachikawa City will gradually become more developed.

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Urges Pedestrians to Obey Traffic Rules</h3>
<p>To Avoid Unfortunate Accidents</p>
<p>The Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement on September 14, urging pedestrians to strictly abide by traffic rules, walk on sidewalks whenever possible, and if there are no sidewalks, to walk as close as possible to the left side of the road. The traffic regulations stipulate in detail that pedestrians should walk along the left-hand sidewalk, but under the current circumstances, the streetlights at night have been reduced to a minimum to meet air defense needs, and the headlights of motorcycles have also been dimmed, making it difficult for drivers to see people walking on the road, or even in the middle of the road. If the lights are turned off, it is even more difficult for drivers to see pedestrians in the middle of the road. When facing oncoming vehicles, drivers must concentrate on avoiding collisions with oncoming vehicles due to the darkness. If there are pedestrians in the middle of the road at this time, there is a risk that they may not be seen in time, leading to accidents. In view of the above points, the Air Defense Headquarters feels it is necessary to urgently remind the public of the importance of strictly observing the above-mentioned traffic rules. At the same time, the Air Defense Headquarters also advises rickshaw drivers, tricycle drivers, and cyclists, for their own safety and the safety of their passengers, not to drive in the middle of the road, and to advise passengers to encourage drivers to drive as close as possible to the left side of the road to avoid unfortunate accidents.</p>

<h3>The Materials Distribution Office Strictly Prevents Rice Shops from Switching Household Rice</h3>
<p>In order to prevent rice merchants from privately switching household rice and taking advantage of the situation, the Materials Distribution Office has ordered all its public rice selling offices and retail rice selling points to follow the example of oil merchants selling household oil, sealing samples of household rice for each period in bottles and displaying them in the store counters. If citizens find that the rice sample does not match when purchasing household rice and have any doubts, they can bring the purchased rice to the Second Section of the office at any time to request an investigation. Once it is verified that the rice merchant has privately switched the rice or even deducted the quantity, the office will severely punish them.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Establishes a Task Force to Discuss Price Control Measures</h3>

The committee members: Lin Kanghou, Wu Xianren, Hu Yigu, Zhao Zheng鏜, Chen Bin龢, Zhang Weiru, Lu Feng, and Ren Yunpeng all attended. The meeting was chaired by Lin Kanghou, and five key points were resolved: ○ The scholarship will be awarded to outstanding students from poor families in the judicial field who are studying law at universities, but the interest is limited, and the Shen Bao will subsidize a portion to make up the difference. ○ The Shen Bao will be entrusted to handle the screening and selection of students applying for scholarships. ○ The name of the committee is determined to be the "[Mr. Zhang Yunbo Scholarship Committee]". In addition to the original eight members, Xiang Kangyuan will be added as a member. ○ In order to supplement the fund, if there are people who sympathize with the cultivation of students in the legal field and are enthusiastic about helping them, their donations may be accepted and collected by the Shen Bao. (However, the donation must be declared as the Mr. Zhang Yunbo Scholarship Fund)</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhou Huili's Birthday Celebration Funds Education</h3>
<p>Zhou Huili, the director of the 克美 Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday. Friends from all walks of life initiated a celebration. Mr. Zhou, considering the extraordinary times, did not want to be extravagant, so he transferred the received congratulatory gifts to the Shen Bao and the News Scholarship Fund, donating 51,900 yuan to each, and also provided 100 free delivery vouchers, requesting the newspaper's social service department to give them to poor primary school teachers. His enthusiastic good deeds are admirable. Yesterday's scholarship donations, Zhou Huili (congratulatory gifts from all walks of life for his 50th birthday transferred to scholarship) 51,900 yuan, list as follows: (Chuan Boyu 2,500 yuan, Zhu Linfeng, Xu Zhongtao, Ruan Huikang, Sun Ronghua, Luo Zhaolai each 2,000 yuan, Ding Old Lady, Du Old Master, Zheng Kaihua, Deng Guobin, Zhou Zhiliang, Zhang Chenglong, Wang Yibin, 森昌泰 Sofa Company, Chen Minshan, Xu Derong, Dai Wenhua, Wang Qishou, Zhang Wenyu, Huang Old Master, Zhu Baolin, Li Honghai, Zhu Xuan, Xie Zhen'ao, Wang Dehua, Sun Qiangen, Yan Jilin each 1,000 yuan, Wang Shixi, Zhou Wenlong, Gu Pingyun each 800 yuan, Deng Senqi, Qin Feng Xing, He Gou Xiong, Huang Jingling each 600 yuan, You Pengxi, Zhou Meiting, Xu Daoheng, Huang Pengxian, Shi Taishan, Lu Zixian, Xu Jinzhang, Wen Old Master, Chen Danian, Shengji Catering Company each 500 yuan, Zheng Yaonan, Huang Yuejing, Hu Yongchi, Wang Chaoliang, Wang Zhenchuan, Qin Runsheng, Luo Songyun, Sun Xingruo, Zheng Digong each 400 yuan, Xu Liangyu, Zhu Xiaotong, Yu Jingde, Li Zhiqing, Yang Yan, Ding Yunxian each 250 yuan, Geng Xingzhi, Yang Bingwen, Shanghai Beverage Factory, Chen Qingyun, Zhou Qiankang, Gu Bao, Jiang Mingde, Cao Jing'an, Chen Peter, Zhang Yaolun, Xu Jiaxiang, Zhong Guanglun, Wang Qixiang, Qu Xuchu, Li Qinzhi, Li Ran, Guo Zhou each 200 yuan, Wang Rujia 100 yuan).

<h3>Correct Use of Air Defense Streetlights</h3>
<p>Must Remain On During Alert Warnings</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Defense Division, in view of the importance of streetlights during air defense, has had the air defense authorities improve the streetlight equipment, adding air defense equipment, reducing the number of lights, and reducing the brightness. At the same time, air defense streetlights have been installed at various traffic intersections, stipulating that they may still be used during alert warnings. However, some secretarial personnel often do not pay attention, fail to repair damaged air defense streetlights, or turn off the air defense streetlights as soon as an alert sounds. This has a significant impact on urban cultural security and transportation issues. Therefore, each branch bureau has been ordered to instruct each Baojia self-defense group to pay close attention, assign personnel to manage the air defense streetlights, and notify the electric light company to repair any damage. At the same time, the opening and closing methods are also being corrected. During alert warnings, the air defense streetlights will remain on, and all air defense streetlights must be turned off after an air raid warning is issued.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Buddhist Association Held a Board Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Municipal Buddhist Association has recently been actively promoting charitable relief, education, and scholarship work. In the summer, it established the Buddhist Clinic at the Guo'en Temple on Pu'an Road, providing medical treatment and medicine on a large scale, which is praised by the poor and sick. In order to expand its work for the benefit of all, the association held its eighth joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Jing'an Temple office yesterday, resolving many important matters. Regarding the recent illegal encroachment, demolition, and sale of the property of Xizhu Temple by He Er'an and Zhang Zita, the association unanimously expressed its indignation and strongly advocated submitting a request to the authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Crime Prevention Section Investigates Various Special Businesses</h3>
<p>The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau is actively promoting crime prevention work. Recently, it has noted that pawnshops, secondhand bicycle shops, and peddling industries are most easily used by petty thieves to dispose of stolen goods and sell them for cash. In addition, special business establishments such as hotels, brothels, dance halls, singing girl societies, and massage parlors are breeding grounds for crime. Therefore, an investigation has been conducted on the above-mentioned industries, and investigation forms have been prepared, instructing each industry to truthfully and detailedly fill out the forms and maintain constant contact with the section. If there is suspicion of receiving stolen goods or if guests in special business establishments have suspicious behavior, the section should be reported for thorough investigation. Otherwise, once it is found that stolen goods have been received or that a guest is a criminal and the matter is not reported, strict punishment will be imposed according to the law.</p>
<h3>Price Increase Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Pastry and Fried Dough Sticks Trade Association, in view of the fact that members who are not members of the association have raised the price of pancakes and fried dough sticks, which has had an impact, specially notified all members yesterday to abide by the original price. The announcement is recorded as follows: [At this time of soaring prices, our industry's pancakes, steamed buns, and fried dough sticks are all food for the common people. Although there is a shortage of raw materials, the association has now prepared a list and submitted it to the authorities for special allocation starting today. (Omission), it is hoped that all members will continue to speak at the original price and must not arbitrarily raise the price. Otherwise, if the investigation is verified, it will be reported to the competent authorities for severe punishment].</p>
<h3>To Prevent Rabies, a Decision is Made to Kill Stray Dogs</h3>
<p>Stray dogs without owners often exhibit mad behavior after being stimulated. A considerable number of ordinary citizens have contracted rabies after being bitten. In the past, during the era of the Public Concession, the patrols would kill them. According to statistics from the Municipal Health Bureau recently, the number of rabies patients admitted to various hospitals in the city has reached 105, exceeding previous records. In order to treat rabies, the bureau has designated the Pasteur Institute on Huangshan Road to specialize in admitting patients with the disease and providing free treatment. In addition, it has sent a letter to the police bureau requesting that all stray dogs in the urban area and suburbs be killed.</p>

<h3>Solicitation for Essays on Tax Revenue Issues</h3>
<p>Adjusting the salaries of civil servants, police, and security teams, improving administrative efficiency, and establishing clean politics are the key points for promoting municipal administration at present. And adjusting salaries requires funds, and the source of funds is nothing more than reorganizing old taxes and increasing new taxes. However, how to reorganize and how to increase taxes to meet needs while also considering the burden on citizens is a matter worth examining and researching. In order to gather ideas, essays are being publicly solicited on the above-mentioned topics, and the rules are as follows: ○ The topic is self-determined, and the theme should focus on tax reorganization and tax increase, targeting the current situation, providing practical suggestions, and avoiding general discussions of principles. ○ There is no limit to the number of words, and the style is not limited, with fluency and expressiveness as the main criteria. ○ The deadline is September 20th, and the essays will be published in this newspaper and monthly magazine. ○ The winning essays will receive 3,000 yuan for first place, 2,000 yuan for second place, 1,000 yuan for third place, and 500 yuan each for fourth to tenth place. ○ Submissions should be sent to the editorial department of this newspaper, marked with the word "[Essay Competition]".</p>
