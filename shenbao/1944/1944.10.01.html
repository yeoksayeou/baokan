<h3 id="c1">如何克服生產隘路 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 劉雲舫</p>
<p>一年容易，又是秋風，民國三十三年所號爲[增產年]者，已像流水般過去大半！環顧過去大半年來所虛度的，倒似乎是個有季節性的[漲價年]，又似乎是個有傳染性的[囤積年]，那裹談到增產？回憶去年國慶紀念日，申報會以[如何增加農工生產]，徵文於地方賢達之士，誠以戰時一切經濟問題的核心，即在於如何增產，猶如人體之強弱，須視其[新陳代謝]的力量爲何如。以增產來補救戰時的消耗，實即合於[新陳代謝]的原理，亦即加強戰時經濟力量的主要關鍵，無論是從軍需方面或是民需方面來講。我們站在民衆立塲，不妨一言今日上海民需工業之淒涼景況。上海各業工廠，一面由於開工率的低減，一面由於生產率的萎縮，已使整個的民需工業，入於半酣睡的狀態，影響所及，物資爲之枯竭，物價爲之昂騰，大衆生活問題之嚴重，由是日趨尖銳化；同時，益以一般暴利主義的橫行，而整個的上海經濟，遂益猖獗凌亂得不可收拾，瞻念前途，曷可無憂。　　本年五月一日上海特別市市政諮詢委員會第一次會議時，陳市長會於其開會辭中說過：[目前上海最迫切問題，厥爲經濟問題，經濟問題一日不能解決，即是上海一般問題，不能解決，—平時的上海所靠者爲物資的集散和生產。戰時上海特資集散，雖不能如平時圓滑，而生產則決不能使之稍停。自大東亞戰爭以來，增強生產爲朝野一致所注目，可是反觀上海的生產，甚至全國，不但減少，且見停頓，這一層深望諸君予以研究。]那末增產年中上海各種工業的減產現象，畢竟是什麼原因呢？說來雖覺原因不止一端，但其顯而著者，約爲歸納如下：○工業原料缺乏問題—上海雖爲中國工業生產的中心，但其工業生產所需之原料，夙即仰給於歐及美南洋各地的輸入；由於戰時航運的困難或斷絕，輸入原料幾成絕路，而上海各種工業原料的存底，至於今日，亦已成爲[枯魚之市]而難乎爲繼了。○電力限制問題—由於近年華北煤斤來源的日漸增少，上海電力公司不得不實行減少電力供應，而首先蒙其影響者，即爲恃電流爲其原動力的上海各種工廠。單就軍需民需共同有關的棉紡織業而言，今年華商紗廠紗錠運轉率，已較去年更形退化，其他純粹民需工業之受電力限制影響而步入減產之途者，更不待言。○勞働力短絀問題—自從物價不斷高漲以來，所謂工資薪給，早不無足重輕，而尤以近年勞工貶視工資之心理爲甚。以農民而言，近年由於農業產物價格之低降，都市工業製品輸入之欠圓滑，無不相率拋鋤離田，紛紛奔走於單幫買賣之途；鄉村中的農民如此，工廠裹工人也多如此。由是而生產勞働力爲之剝削殆盡，其足影響戰時生產之程序，又不待言·○製成品限價問題—商品限價標準，往往未會顧到生產者的合理利潤，甚至有時低於成本，遂致許多廠家成爲囤積原料的倉庫，不復成爲製造商品的工廠。○產業資金渙散問題—增產大道中最大的障碍，莫如生產資金的汎濫而不能集中。上海爲游資充斥之都市，但自今年農曆新年以至今日，不但上海固有的游資，幾已盡入囤積投機之途，甚至華北南流的資金，也有大部份同歸於道條路上，還有什麼產業資金之可言？　　上面所說的，是今年增產年中所逢的隘路，祇是[已涼天氣未寒時]，策鞭邁進，時猶未晚；凡足成爲增產大道中之障碍者，必須竭力設法克服，從速採取有能率的增產措置，同時，對於已往的一切施策，重加調整，作一根本的補救，而對於上述種種成爲生產障碍之各項問題，必須切實施行有效的對策如次：　　第一，工業原料必須在可能範圍以內，使其源源有所接濟，同時，尤須儘量使用土產原料與一切原料代替品；此在今日世界交戰國家中，多已行之有效，我國實宜急起直追。第二，電力供應切盼更經一度合理的調整，使今後上海各業每月限制用電量，得以超過現時之平均量百分之五十左右，同時，儘量限制一般無謂消耗的電量來挹注工業用電，或將一部份與民生無關的工業用電來移助民需工業的電力需要。第三，生產勞働力必須積極予以扶助培養，是則有賴於農村經濟之復興，包括維持農民生活的安定，保障其生命財產之安全，圓滑都市與農村間的物資交流，至對工業勞働者，亦須以同樣精神，優予維持，並使其享受種種特別權益與待遇，以堅定其工作之意志。第四，製造品限價今後必須衡情提高，以成本再加合理利潤爲核定限價之標準，以不妨礙生產者的利益爲鼓勵生產的原則。第五，國中大量游資，尤其上海方面，必須令其集中生產事業；財政與金融當局於其審愼放款之中，須使農工生產有隨時接受銀行貸款之傾向，以符戰時資金調整之政策。　　最後對於克服生產隘路的要義還有一點必須注重的，就是生產者與消費者的心理病態，必須於此時有一轉變：生產者從今而後，必須人人憬然覺悟於投機以圖暴利之爲不可恃，努力以求增加生產之爲大道，同時，消費者必須人人憬然覺悟於肆情揮霍以求享樂之爲不合理，努力以求節約消費之爲上策。總之一句話，在生產者與消費者共同合作，政府與人民一致努力之下，凝集國民總力，打開今日生產的隘路，非但時猶未晚，並且相信現階段的環境，確爲上海市經濟復興的最佳起點，因爲戰時國家經濟措施，與國民經濟生活，應當要隨着戰爭之發展而更加緊張起來，俾與戰爭的國策密切配合。</p>

<p>東京三十日中央社電　大宮島及迭尼安島之經過槪要如次：</p>
<h3 id="c5">大宮島 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>○大宮島方面，七月二十一日指曉，敵軍於該島西北岸明石灣海面，以航空母艦數艘，運輸船六十餘艘及戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦約三十艘來侵，於熾烈砲擊支援下，企圖登陸，上午六時始於明石灣方面，以水陸兩用戰車約一百五十輛及登陸用舟艇約三百艘一舉靠岸，然當地日軍猛烈攻擊之，尤以本田山附近日軍之砲擊更爲激烈，敵軍損失甚大。數小時間，敵於珊瑚礁沿岸猶未能前進，直至正午許始強行登陸，昭和灣方面，八時許以水陸兩用戰車五十輛及登陸用艇二百餘艘開始登陸，日軍當即邀擊之，敵戰車五十輛中有三十輛擱淺起火，並擊沉擊毀其多量舟艇，截至下午，敵軍更由海岸前進二公里內外，是日傍晚，登陸之敵軍兵力兩地會合，約有一師餘之衆。是日夜間日軍決行夜襲，然因敵軍艦砲射擊熾烈，致未能將其擊潰，二十三·四兩日，再於敵軍登陸點附近繼續激戰，守於須磨附近之日軍，二十四日對先後二次企圖於里濱登陸之敵軍予以重創，敵軍第一次會以登陸用運輸船二艘，水陸兩用戰車二十餘輛來侵，然其運輸船一艘，戰車十一輛被日軍擊沉一艘中彈起火，前後兩次悉被擊退。又於同日夕刻，椗泊於該灣內之一萬噸級運輸艦命中砲彈二十餘發，截至二十四日傍晚，昭和灣方面之敵軍戰車突砲轟帙羽山附近日軍陣地，進出於該地之東方。須磨地方日守軍，刻仍於半島前部之狹隘部，確保該半島奧洛特之機塲，明石灣方面敵軍，因遭日軍反攻，殆未能前進，敵機之跳梁，執拗常非，故日軍行動頗感困難。二十五日夜日守軍予明石灣方面敵軍以極大打擊，集結帙羽山附近前進之部隊寺，舉全兵力，陸海軍結成一體，蹂躪敵陣，并已突進至明石街西方及明石灣，海軍由於本攻擊已使敵軍心鷺胆寒，然日軍戰力亦漸減低。至二十六日，敵深知日方兵力稀薄，乃以戰車爲前鋒，全綫向日軍陣地突入勞薩受其南展高地，逐次侵據本田屯高地。二十八日敵戰車出現於本田山南方高地，是日中午以後，戰況極爲酷烈，日軍利用該島北部之森林地帶，頑強應戰，二十九日夕刻，開始前進，三十一日夕刻，在春田山之南北綫上整理戰綫。八月二日，敵軍在三十輛戰車之掩護下，近迫日軍陣地，斯時，日軍指揮，連絡補給等，愈形困難，戰力亦逐降，五日戰綫完全錯綜，七日集結於又木山部隊司令部周圍，尚能作戰之兵員陸海軍僅三百名，當時亦無一發砲火，是晚因傷而不能挺起者完全自決，翌（八日）夜半最高指揮官親臨陣頭，揮刃斬入又木山南方三路附近敵羣，戰後生存者，在各局地展開邀擊戰，九月二十七日全軍壯烈陣亡，不僅日守軍即設營隊及日僑等亦皆一致協力奮戰六十八日之久。消耗敵軍龐大實力，最高指揮官於後突擊時，會發出電報如次：日軍神兵於國難之環境中，志氣極旺盛，態度亦極鎭靜，雖於慘酷之砲擊下，朝朝奉唱軍人勅諭，凜烈之聲，實足驚天地而泣鬼神。每聞本部隊之耗門，於作戰全局上貢獻甚大時，輒以此爲無上之光榮，而抱必死之決心，大元帥陛下垂宥我等，故惟有感激，吾等相信日本致勝，更望奮戰到底。</p>
<h3 id="c6">迭尼安 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>○迭尼安島方面，七月二十四日上午五時，敵軍於艦艇掩護下，在迭尼安港正面集結約四十艘，西半島約百四十艘之艦艇，企圖一齊登陸，迭尼安島方面遂即展開猛烈戰門，不久敵艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘即中彈起火，又擊毀敵巡洋艦一艘，登陸用舟艇亦多被擊毀或擊沈，敵之企圖遂成泡影，敵軍即全被擊退，西北海岸西砲台附近之敵軍亦被擊退，此後敵以熾烈砲火，同時於海岸一帶更施設大規模烟幕，一部敵軍即在此掩護下正午登陸成功，是日黃昏，更進至第一，第四飛機塲，此時敵登陸兵力已達步兵三大隊，戰車三十輛，砲兵一聯隊之程度，日守軍於是日午夜，舉全力作壯烈之夜襲，一部敵陣地復被日軍奪回。二十五日敵軍仍於熾烈之砲擊下，自塞班島增派援軍登陸，其兵力不下一個師團，是夜，日軍再度夜襲，予敵以相當打擊，然以敵軍燃放大量照明彈，故未能充分發揮威力，然敵之前進受阻，未得進展。又以敵之猛烈砲擊，因而日軍損害漸增，乃於二十七日晚炸卡羅里納斯高地戰綫，決行最後之攻擊，並將在該島居住自十六歲至四十五歲之日人壯年男子約三千名，編成義勇隊，與日軍共同參加激戰，三十日敵軍進至第三飛機場，三十一日黎明，日軍轉取攻勢，當於第三飛機塲南方展開激戰，此種血戰死門，繼續至當日黃昏，已予敵以重創，然日方亦有相當死傷。是夜並發出電報，其要旨如次：將兵幾經勇戰，而守備迭尼安島之責任，仍未如願達成，慚愧無以復加，對國家長期之教育培養及優渥之激勵，深表感激，最後更祈皇室之彌榮典國運之隆昌，因傷而不能行動者，均行壯烈自決，當日黃昏，生存者一齊作最後之突擊，此後六十日之長時期內，即轉入遊擊戰，直至九月二十七日，全員遂相繼壯烈陣亡。大宮及迭尼安兩島日人，視死如歸，不畏苦難，始終舉全力協力軍方作戰，完成壯志，殊值欽敬。</p>

<p>松島部長昨發表談話　　中央社訊　關於守備大宮島及迭尼安島日陸·海軍部隊全體壯烈犧牲事，日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長發表談話如次：○守備大宮島及迭尼安島之日陸·海軍部隊，自敵人在塞班島方面出現後，即協助該島守備部隊，以寡敵衆，邀擊敵人。七月二十一日以後，敵人有力部隊開始登陸，守備隊隨即加以反擊，予以慘重損害。直至九月二十七日爲止，在此七十天中，處於孤島之日陸·海軍從海·陸·空三方面猛烈攻擊敵人，忍耐一切困苦，使敵人胆寒，結果完成任務，全體壯烈犧牲，誠令人切齒痛恨。但全體將士能戰至最後一兵一卒，出乎敵人意表，發揮最大戰鬥力，此固戰史上罕見之壯舉，尤以與守備部隊同心協力，從容赴難之留居僑胞，更表現我日本傳統精神。吾人得訊之後，唯衷心表示感謝而已。</p>

<p>當敵人企圖反攻太平洋時，早已預料彼等必將在馬里亞納方面出現，我方基於大戰略方針，整備邀擊姿態，但欲在最後決戰擊滅敵人，必須具有下列各條件，１適切選擇決戰時機，使敵人一蹶不振。２準備集中足以擊滅敵人之兵力。３使易於獲得勝利，必須在決戰以前予敵人以最大損害。該方面守備部隊，基於以上方針，全軍作壯烈犧牲，收獲圓滿戰果，將士等所嘗之辛酸，實爲筆墨不能形容其萬一，此由於逐次發表即可明瞭。以兵力及兵器戰至最後一兵一卒，以完成所負使命，此乃我日本皇軍之精神，彼等在昭和十二年八月上海廣中路激戰，又在上海陸戰隊最大危機中均能克服一切，發揮此種精神，與捨棄部屬逃赴考勤基多要塞之麥克沃塞相比，不可同日而語。敵方亦能深切認識日軍之戰鬥精神，尼米資與麥克沃塞前會屢次指出太平洋作戰前途之難關，九月二十六日，西南太平洋聯合軍地上部隊指揮官蒲律加大將，亦對日軍大加讚賞。　　○大宮島與迭尼安島之失陷，誠屬遺憾，但自以上大方針觀察，則其所負使命已充分達到，因此今後我戰略態勢不受絲毫動搖，反而使敵人遭重大損失，吾人能獲得估計敵人作戰能力之詳細資料，對於今後作戰更爲有　。　　○敵人之太平洋反攻，最近在帛琉羣島之培里琉島受一大挫拆，又在九月二十三日以前，已遭受相等於攻陷塞班島之大損失，以一萬噸病院船二艘裝載死傷兵士，此可謂爲今後戰勢之序幕，此皆由於塞班，大宮，迭尼安各島日軍奮鬥而獲得之戰略上效果。</p>

<p>太平洋戰局展望</p>
<h3 id="c41">聯合艦隊必勝的基礎 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 山本海軍報道班員</p>
<p>筆者每與中國新聞人晤面時，輒被訊：[日本的聯合艦隊如何？]作此問的或許不限於中國人，但這是極不可捉摸的質疑。對此，祗有這樣答覆：[當然，聯合艦隊位置於其應處的地方，做其應做的事。]　　但在這漠然的質疑的另一面，確有更根本的緣由。蓋在世界上宣傳得如何精強的日本海軍聯合艦隊，自去年十一月美國太平洋艦隊攻擊吉爾貝特羣島以來，歷經本年二月的馬紹爾羣島登陸戰，三月的阿杜米拉第羣島登陸戰，更自六月至七八月的馬利亞納羣島登陸戰等諸戰役，對敵艦隊的大規模行動，完全保守沉默，關於這一點，抱着一種想明白其究竟的心境。　　然而要明確地了解這中間的情形，先須充分知道一般地以物量表現的敵的兵力，特別是海軍關係兵力的變遷狀態。限於篇幅，不獲列舉詳細的數字，但就去年新竣工的艦艇隻數而觀，據海軍部長佐列斯達（當時的海軍部次長）今年一月公布的數字稱：</p>
<h3 id="c42">敵方兵力變遷狀態 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>一九四三年竣工艦艇　　戰艦二艘（埃渥華與新喬治）　　航空母艦六十五艘（制式六，巡洋艦改裝九，護送用五十）　　巡洋艦十一艘　　驅逐艦一百二十八艘　　潛水艦五十六艘　　護送用驅逐艦三百零六艘　　合計五百六十八艘。　　即去年一年中，敵每日計建造艦艇一艘半。這公佈或許不免有點誇大，但敵自那次珍珠灣慘敗後，不惜錢財物資，埋首苦幹，積極從事建艦工作，卒於二年後獲此成績。且這不但在艦艇方面，飛機亦然。祇要參照前述公報中的航空母艦竣工隻數，自然可以明白了。</p>
<h3 id="c43">內綫作戰準備完成 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>然而我海軍對這敵海軍增強艦艇的狀態，自不致熟視無睹。不待說，我方也有新銳艦艇的陸續守工，但與美國的物量不能競爭，故不會繼續作雙方對消的消耗戰爭。於是對於兵力狀況的變化，當然要求聯合艦隊戰略之劃時期的轉變。這樣，我聯合艦隊乃暫不以敵艦隊爲對手，敵艦隊視我聯合艦隊爲目中釘，亟欲拔出，趁敵艦隊遠至西太平洋出擊的機會，一舉而殲滅之。蓋已整備了所謂內綫作戰的態勢。　　自進入這內綫作戰以來，漸近一年，在這期間，敵人在太平洋上擄了多少意外之財呢？這是很有興味的問題。我軍在吉爾伯特，馬紹爾，阿杜米拉第，馬利亞納等各戰役中，大槪損失二三萬，而敵的損害，絕對不下五六萬。又敵人佔領了達拉瓦島，瑪金島，奎塞林島，魯俄特島，塞班島等許多小島，但其代價，如戰艦，航空母艦，巡洋艦等許多優秀艦艇，或被擊沉，或受損傷。恐怕這些喪失損傷艦艇的甲板面積之總和，可與前述諸島嶼的陸地面積之總和相等。　　這裹祗有一點，即敵的最前綫逐漸迫近我本土，或許可算作敵方唯一的收獲。然而這也就是敵的最前綫逐漸遠離本國，即所謂補給綫的拉長。大洋上的海軍作戰，補給綫的拉長，極爲不利，這不利的程序，原則上是以補給綫之長的自乘爲比便。運輸船裝載了火器，彈藥，糧食及其他一切軍需品，遠涉重洋，其辛勞可想而知。　　反之，在我方看來，敵人的接近，毌寗可視爲我方所堅持的內綫作戰之具體進展的表示。即最接近自己兵站基地的敵艦隊，在其最有利的海域，完全加以殲滅的絕好機會，逐漸迫近了。　　如此看來，這一年來敵艦隊跳梁的期間，我方並沒有什麼作戰上的齟齬，這事實誰都記得很清楚吧。　　上述內綫作戰的意義，未加深思的人，自然會發同[所謂聯合隊如何]的質疑。這是很可杞憂的</p>
<h3 id="c44">聯合艦隊必操勝算 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>關於聯合艦隊的實力，今無需在這裹贅述。聯合艦隊即使今日立即與敵艦隊主力挑戰，依筆者說恐怕也能制勝。　　但最重要者，這塲合[恐怕]就是[困難]。先前用圖表叙述敵國軍事生產力，當然不止是去年度的，今年，來年仍將繼續發揮。所以聯合艦隊不能說萬一失敗的話，千分之千，萬分之萬，不能不獲得完全的勝利。即不單勝利，其勝利的方法尚附有條件。[必勝]這句話，並不是祗限於有關聯合艦隊的一種觀念的意義，那文字的原意與重量，充滿在這二字裹面。日本海軍端坐在如森林般肅穆的陣營中。　　今自豐田司令長官以至一水兵，深切地印入了這二字的意義，不是輕易在口頭上說說的話。而[聯合艦隊如何]等質疑的意義，自然可以明瞭了。　　敵人在塞班島登陸作戰時，德富蘇峰先生鼓勵海軍謂：[劍道中有稱雲岡流者，尤以相打更須用這意氣而行]。但筆者以爲相打正相反對。相打絕對不能不蒙受幾下，因此，在某種塲合，不能不忍氣吞聲，隱忍自重。這就是一年來的內綫作戰，今後仍將保持冷靜，等待着眞正一刀二斷的機會。這樣方才能夠始終一貫地發揮內綫作戰的妙諦。</p>
<h3 id="c45">航空兵力勝敗關鍵 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>敵人近來漸漸迫近展開菲島反攻戰的地方了。摩鹿加羣島，帛琉羣島方面的戰門，爲其前哨戰。這裹我們無論如何不能忍視者，彼我航空兵力的問題。　　大槪一說到海軍，任何人都想那艦艇的偉容，這是當然的，蓋海軍的主體終究是艦艇。但我們不要忘記，在海軍的戰鬥上，航空兵力的位置，表示着極度重要性。　　開戰初在珍珠灣慘敗的美國，漸注意海點中航空兵力的重要性，之後，積極努力增強航空兵力。現在所使用的各種飛機之性能，相當優秀，此則可率直地承認者。且其數量，雖經勇敢邀擊，不斷遭遇損害，當頗充裕。　　筆者前會說過：[聯合艦隊今日縱立即對敵艦隊主力挑戰，恐怕亦能制勝。]但所謂[恐怕]者，或許萬一有意外的結果。那萬一何由而致呢？筆者所杞憂者，惟在於彼我航空兵力有無差別而已。蓋無論怎樣誇爲無敵的強靭的聯合艦隊，由於彼我航空兵力的均衡情形，而有在不知不覺中戰敗的可能。是以有人關心[聯合艦隊如何]，根本上應視爲[日本飛機生產狀態之表現]。　　此時揭述敵美航空技術者亞歷山大，塞伐斯基所說的航空重心論，不無意義。塞伐斯基在其所著[空軍致勝]一文中，對當局關於航空兵力無充分認識，加以痛論。　　[應如何重視空軍力，雖在珍珠灣攻擊後一個月，迄未印入當局者的陳腐頭腦中，即當向議會提出龐大的預算，某高級將軍將校聲稱：[我們以本預算摧破敵的海上兵力，以確獲制海欋]。這聲明公然暴露當局者戰略觀念的貧弱。且不但議員，言論界與輿論界亦肯定這聲明。這種聲明極易使我們理解怎樣的無責任。假定[摧毀敵的海上兵力]是可能的話，但僅此我們就能[確保制海權]嗎？　　且僅[摧毀了海上兵力]以後，我們的艦隊果能突入日本海面，砲擊港灣，潛水艦基地，或沿岸要塞嗎？答覆是完全否定的。</p>
<h3 id="c46">敵美進攻自投羅綱 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>日本如維持有效的空軍力，這種進攻作戰，必然是自投羅綱，進入從陸丘基地出發的航空力之活動圈，乃自殺的行爲。擊破了日本艦隊以後，我們能切斷日本與亞洲大陸的交通綫嗎？我們的艦隊能堂堂進攻日本海，浮遊於台灣海峽，或日本封鎖下的中國沿岸水域嗎？　　祗要從日本的陸上基地出發的航空力存在着，我們的艦隊必遭全軍覆沒　　且我們的艦隊一擊滅敵艦隊之後]能夠奪還菲島，馬來，荷印，澳洲附近的島嶼嗎？答覆再是個[否]字。祗要敵的航空兵力存在於這些地方，任令我們的艦隊有無數艦艇，亦不能進入這　域·要之，如日本維持有力的空軍，確保制空權，則縱潰滅了日本的海軍力，亦無何等效果。我們的艦隊不能靠近敵空軍力支配下的一切海域的。]　　以上是現在太平洋上海空戰略的原則。戰爭中原則的遵守最爲重要。關於航空兵力的重要性，塞伐斯基的話已經說得很清楚，不必多說了。現在自菲島方面爲始的太平洋所有海域上，能夠儘量使用最多數的航空兵力，乃聯合艦隊必勝的最重要基礎。現實的戰局，在這種思想中一天天消長着，一天天發展着。（翼譯）</p>

<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>ＸＸ：　　你們一定會這樣想：我該是個幸運的人。的確，一個離開學校剛祇二十天的青年，在一已騎瞎馬般的亂撞中，竟在滿地荊棘中找到了出路，從此跨開大步進入社會，幹自己的職業去，這是十分幸運的。並且，你們以爲我的生活很平靜，很舒適，此後，我可不再像以前般的會讓苦悶壓倒了。事實上恰恰相反，這半月來工作的結果，使我的心境有所改變，[生活的情調究竟是異樣的了]。這是最顯著的一點　　我並不向你們說，生活的滋味是酸的，是甜的，是苦的……，因爲給予生活的評價，各個觀念不同的人一定是不一致的。但我的靈魂，——你們一向稱我爲不安寧的孩子的靈魂——很自然地要向你們訴說。你們總能了解我所以找尋職業的緣故，爲了當前的時局，不安寧的生活，爲了經憂慮重重打擊的父親的覺痛的言語：[孩子，我被生活逼迫得透不過氣來……]我毅然地，也是被逼迫着地，走現在的路　　你們也了解我，，我一生的願望，並不在現在的職業上。現在職業圈內的人物，那些市儈們，是我平日所痛惡仇視着的；而這無一時間不義滿銅臭味的四周，更是我深深厭惡着的。但是，[爲了生活，爲了吃飯，爲了混日子]。我把自己投進平日所不願去的地方！旣生活在這圈子裹，又非[適應環境]不可，於是，我的改變是極可能的。不過，我肯定地說：環境只能改變我的外形，而不能改變我的內心。除了暫時做一個寄生蟲，渡一渡難關，別無旁的目的寄託在這裹　　我現在的生活，簡直是時光的浪費，生命之虛擲；工作的毫無意義，使我的靈魂痛苦。我每一分鐘像是受了銷鏈的桎梏，永遠地坐在牢獄裹。辦公室裹，各色各樣的臉，各色各樣的表情，那些妨忌拍馬，厭惡……種種卑下的行爲，每一時間搬演發生着，這使我有極大的反感，那些庸俗的人們，坐在椅子裹，悠然地抽着烟，聯着天！他們談股票，談女人，談打牌，談年戲，總之，他們是一切靡爛生活的代表者，使我更發生反感。　　有些人說：一個青年人跑進社會去，若以以前的作風來應付環境，準會失敗而歸；祗有迎合潮流，眼睛識人，討好上級，纔會一帆風順，節節上升。我決不這樣做，我那絕不肯無緣故降低自己人格的性格，始終倔強地完整着。我雖已幹了半月，然而，我從未向那些勢利的人們作一次諂諛的笑，或說一句懦怯的話，我依照該做的做了，決不想追求那些非本分的，非正當的東西。當我眼看着許多人們，—那些人間的狗—在無目的地盲幹；他們的心充滿了猜疑，畏懼，他們的手段是狡猾，惡毒，他們的生存沒有目標，祇用手段，他們沒想到義務去爲人類盡一點責任，祗是貪圖着亨樂，追求金錢；爲了盲目的欲念，出賣了自己的靈魂，喪失了自己的人格。　　我和這些人站在二個極端，像水和火一樣，沒有可以調和的地方；我的道德觀念，理想的生活，都和他們相異。因此，我孤獨了。有時，我的一副樣子，被他們嘲笑着，他們以爲我是多麼傻，多麼蠢，不懂人情世故。這潮笑不就此引起我的反感，仇視，我不報復他們，—當然，這並不是不抵抗主義，而是這些人沒有抵抗的必要；只要將來偶一回顧他們，這些人一定已跌進黑暗的深淵裹，墮落到垂死的方向去了。　　然而，不幸的事終於發生了。我是個靈魂不甘寂寞的孩子，我是要找求個豐滿的生活，理想的人生的；所以，每覺有利用時間的可能，我就看書；—這樣，一些也不會妨碍工作的效率—一天，一個長得胖胖的主任走過來說：[在辦公時間內，不可看書]。他沒有講不可看書的理由，走了。我的內心十分怒恨，十分痛苦；但，我忍受下來了，我不向他反抗一句。另一天已過了辦公時間，我專心看着書，恰有一件小事，沒有注意，一位副主任不扳着脸说：[眞呆，手也不會動，老是捧着書]。這簡直是一種勢利，一種於我人格上的侮辱，但我還是忍受了下來，不向他反抗。　　[幹了這種工作，年青人再沒有以前般的自由了。]我想。但我並不就此絕望，悲哀，人們爲了生活，該有所忍受的。而且，對於生活，不應取消極的態度，如咒咀，退避厭惡等，都是一種大的罪噁；祗有積極地奮鬥，強化自己，才是個好方法。人生是多曲折的，人生的路是無窮盡的，要達到理想的樂園，只有正視現實，勇敢地向前走。　　年青的人，誰不想過自由的讀書生活，誰不想創造自己的理想生活。我雖然幹了違反自己志趣的工作，喪失了求學的機會，但我仍幻想着一片光明的前途，我自信下面的話，所謂：[學校教育是依照了普遍的法則，而設施其課程的：它的最高目的，雖在求人類理想的幸福生活，實際，它卻訓練了社會的基本者或中庸者；一般特殊者或天才者，則在任何困苦環境下，自己教育自己，從教訓中，從工作中，向個人理想的目標，進行創造與發展。]　　我不知你們會否讀過一個作者的話，他寫着：[人們爲了生活彷佛是狗，但除生活之外還有別的希求。]不能否認自己的矛盾，我以爲自己周圍的人是狗，那我也有成爲狗的可能性。—從第三者客觀的立塲上觀察，我也許是外形的狗。但，我有着靈魂，有着純潔的心田：現在的工作與生活是兩件事，我於生活之外有一個崇高生活的希求；這環境，這工作，不能阻撓我心靈的行進，反之，這環境鍛鍊我更接近希求的生活方面去。　　無論如何，污濁的空氣，只能傷害我的肺，不能傷害我的心；同樣，惡劣的環境，祗能給我以一種打擊，一個發奮的好機會，而決不向它順服投降。現在的生活，增加了我內在的堅靭性，加強了我的信念；現實給我的教訓，使我緊咬着牙，緊握住拳。一個人生存的價值是決定於他的工作上的，今日無意養的工作，是爲了求未來生活的辦法，也恰如朝陽中的一滴露珠，佔着極小的時間。將來，從這環境走向另一環境裹，一定不再是[爲了吃飯，爲了混日子。]是爲工作而生活。而對於現在的生活，覺得不過在生命史上留一個痕跡罷了。</p>
<h3 id="c48">談襯托 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴克</p>
<p>要把黑色的東西變得更黑，而不加黑色上去，那祇要在周圍或後面加點白色或放一件白的物件，那時看上去，黑色物要比先前深得多了，這是美術上的襯托原理。　　這種原理好似大多數人都已經知道，而且還會應用到實生活方面去。他們知道要使別人遭殃才顯得出自己的可慶幸，要毀謗了他人才顯得出自己的崇高。所以拚命在經理或高等職員的耳邊，說同事的種種壞話，更加以畫蛇添足，釜底加薪，甚至不惜揑造，賴此以襯托出自己的動儉，無私，有爲，可靠，以獲優寵。　　以無理的壓迫，推人落水，卻洋洋然以爲正是襯托出自己的權威了。被迫得無路可走，爲讒言中傷而失業者，便因此產生，意志薄弱些的，甚至會走了人生的末路—墮落自殺。　　自作聰明的人們啊！卻不想一想天下只有他懂得襯托的原理嗎？他知道用這種手段施之別人，難道第三者不能用更高明的手段施之於他嗎？所謂[強中更有強中手]，[惡人還被惡人磨]。不正是果報不爽的至理名言麼？　　譬如說襯托物的顏色和被襯托之物相同，而襯托物比被襯托物顏色更深時，那麼被襯托之物的顏色就會覺得淡了。就像電燈罷，在夜裹固是光明燦爛，但到了白晝便自失其功效。同樣的，用盡機鋒的人，這時候，他便也將嚐到被他所苦痛的人的痛苦了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">How to Overcome Production Bottlenecks <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yunfang</p>
<p>Another year has passed easily, and the autumn wind blows again. More than half of the year 1944, hailed as the [Increase Production Year], has flowed away like water! Looking back at the past half-year, which has been largely wasted, it seems to have been a seasonal [Price Increase Year] and a contagious [Hoarding Year]. Where is the increase in production? Recalling last year's National Day celebration, the Shen Bao newspaper solicited essays from local dignitaries on [How to Increase Agricultural and Industrial Production], as the core of all wartime economic issues lies in how to increase production, just as the strength or weakness of the human body depends on the power of its [Metabolism]. To compensate for wartime consumption through increased production is in line with the principle of [Metabolism] and is also the key to strengthening wartime economic power, whether from the perspective of military needs or civilian needs. From the perspective of the people, we might as well speak of the bleak situation of Shanghai's civilian industries today. Factories in various industries in Shanghai, due to both the reduction in operating rates and the shrinkage of production rates, have entered a semi-dormant state. This has led to a depletion of resources and a rise in prices, exacerbating the already serious problems of the masses. At the same time, the rampant prevalence of profiteering has further plunged the entire Shanghai economy into a chaotic and irrecoverable state. Looking ahead, how can we not be worried?</p>
<p>At the first meeting of the Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Advisory Committee on May 1 this year, Mayor Chen said in his opening remarks: [The most pressing issue in Shanghai today is the economic problem. If the economic problem cannot be solved in a day, then the general problems of Shanghai cannot be solved either. In peacetime, Shanghai relied on the collection, distribution, and production of goods. Although the collection and distribution of resources in wartime Shanghai cannot be as smooth as in peacetime, production must not be allowed to stop even slightly. Since the Greater East Asia War, increasing production has been the focus of attention of both the government and the public. However, looking at the production of Shanghai, and even the entire country, it has not only decreased but has also come to a standstill. I sincerely hope that you will study this matter.] So, what are the reasons for the phenomenon of reduced production in various industries in Shanghai during the Increase Production Year? Although there are undoubtedly multiple reasons, the most prominent ones can be summarized as follows: ○ The problem of a lack of industrial raw materials – Although Shanghai is the center of China's industrial production, its raw materials have long relied on imports from Europe, America, and Southeast Asia. Due to the difficulty or cessation of wartime shipping, the import of raw materials has become almost impossible, and the stockpiles of various industrial raw materials in Shanghai have become a "dry fish market" today, making it difficult to continue. ○ The problem of electricity restrictions – Due to the gradual decrease in coal supply from North China in recent years, the Shanghai Electric Power Company has had to reduce electricity supply, and the first to be affected are the various factories in Shanghai that rely on electricity as their power source. Taking the cotton textile industry, which is related to both military and civilian needs, as an example, the operating rate of spindles in Chinese-owned yarn mills this year has deteriorated further than last year. It goes without saying that other purely civilian industries have also been affected by electricity restrictions and have entered a path of reduced production. ○ The problem of labor shortages – Since prices have continued to rise, wages and salaries have long been inadequate, and especially in recent years, laborers have had a growing tendency to look down on wages. Farmers, in recent years, due to the low prices of agricultural products and the uneven import of urban industrial products, have all abandoned their plows and left their fields, rushing to engage in small-scale trading. The farmers in the countryside are doing this, and so are many workers in factories. As a result, the productive labor force has been almost completely depleted, which inevitably affects the wartime production process. ○ The problem of price controls on manufactured goods – The price control standards often fail to take into account the reasonable profits of producers, and sometimes are even lower than the cost, leading many factories to become warehouses for hoarding raw materials, no longer factories for manufacturing goods. ○ The problem of dispersed industrial capital – The biggest obstacle to increasing production is the proliferation of production funds without being concentrated. Shanghai is a city filled with idle capital, but from the Lunar New Year to today, not only has the inherent idle capital of Shanghai almost entirely entered the path of hoarding and speculation, but even the capital flowing south from North China has largely followed the same path. What industrial capital can be spoken of?</p>
<p>The above are the bottlenecks encountered during this Increase Production Year. As the saying goes, "[It's still not cold after the heat has passed]." If we spur our horses forward, it is not too late. All obstacles in the way of increasing production must be overcome by all possible means. Effective measures to increase production should be adopted as soon as possible. At the same time, all past policies should be re-adjusted and fundamentally remedied. The following effective countermeasures must be implemented for each of the above-mentioned problems that hinder production:</p>
<p>First, industrial raw materials must be supplied continuously within the possible range. At the same time, indigenous raw materials and all raw material substitutes must be used as much as possible. This has been effectively implemented in many countries at war in the world today, and our country should catch up quickly. Second, it is earnestly hoped that the electricity supply will be reasonably adjusted once again, so that the monthly restricted electricity consumption of various industries in Shanghai can exceed the current average by about 50%. At the same time, the consumption of electricity for general unnecessary purposes should be restricted as much as possible to supplement industrial electricity, or some industrial electricity unrelated to people's livelihood should be transferred to meet the electricity needs of civilian industries. Third, the productive labor force must be actively supported and cultivated, which depends on the revitalization of the rural economy, including maintaining the stability of farmers' lives, ensuring the safety of their lives and property, and smoothing the exchange of goods between cities and the countryside. Industrial laborers must also be maintained in the same spirit, and given various special rights and treatments to strengthen their willingness to work. Fourth, the price limits for manufactured goods must be raised in the future, with the cost plus reasonable profit as the standard for determining the price limit, and not hindering the interests of producers as the principle for encouraging production. Fifth, the large amount of idle capital in the country, especially in Shanghai, must be concentrated in productive enterprises. Financial authorities, in their prudent lending, must ensure that agricultural and industrial production has a tendency to accept bank loans at any time, in line with the wartime capital adjustment policy.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that must be emphasized regarding the key to overcoming production bottlenecks: the psychological illnesses of producers and consumers must undergo a change at this time. From now on, producers must all realize that speculation for exorbitant profits is unreliable, and strive to increase production as the main path. At the same time, consumers must all realize that indulging in extravagance for enjoyment is unreasonable, and strive to save consumption as the best policy. In a word, with the joint cooperation of producers and consumers, and the united efforts of the government and the people, pooling the total national strength to break through the current production bottlenecks is not only not too late, but also believed that the current environment is indeed the best starting point for the economic recovery of Shanghai, because the national economic measures and national economic life in wartime should become more tense with the development of the war, so as to closely coordinate with the national policy of war.</p>

<p>Garrison Abandoned After Fierce Fighting on Miyako and Tinian Islands</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 30th: The Japanese army on Miyako Island and Tinian Island fought to the last man. It is now presumed that the entire army fought bravely and fiercely, and died heroically before September 27. The army commander in the area was Lieutenant General Hidetoshi Obata, the army commander on Miyako Island was Lieutenant General Hyo Tatekoshi, the navy commander was Captain Yutaka Sugimoto, the army commander on Tinian Island was Colonel Takashi Ogata, and the navy commander was Captain Goichi Ohka. The Japanese residents on both islands also cooperated with the military throughout the war, and the entire population seemed to share the same fate as the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Two Months of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Army <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of the events on Miyako Island and Tinian Island is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e5">Miyako Island <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>○ On Miyako Island, at dawn on July 21, enemy forces invaded the island off Akashi Bay on the northwest coast, with several aircraft carriers, more than 60 transport ships, and about 30 battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Under the support of intense shelling, they attempted to land. At 6:00 AM, they began to land in the Akashi Bay area with about 150 amphibious tanks and about 300 landing craft. However, the local Japanese army launched a fierce attack, especially the shelling by the Japanese army near Mount Honda was even more intense, causing heavy losses to the enemy forces. For several hours, the enemy was unable to advance along the coral reef. It was not until around noon that they forcibly landed. In the Showa Bay area, around 8:00 AM, they began landing with 50 amphibious tanks and more than 200 landing craft. The Japanese army immediately intercepted them. Of the 50 enemy tanks, 30 ran aground and caught fire, and a large number of their craft were sunk or destroyed. By the afternoon, the enemy forces that landed at the two locations had merged, totaling more than one division. On the night of the same day, the Japanese army launched a night attack, but because the enemy's naval artillery fire was intense, they failed to defeat them. On the 23rd and 24th, fierce battles continued near the enemy's landing points. The Japanese army defending near Suma inflicted heavy damage on the enemy forces who attempted to land at Rihama twice. The enemy first invaded with two landing transport ships and more than 20 amphibious tanks, but one transport ship and eleven tanks were sunk by the Japanese army, and one caught fire after being hit. Both attempts were repelled. Also on the evening of the same day, a 10,000-ton transport ship anchored in the bay was hit by more than 20 shells. By the evening of the 24th, enemy tanks in the Showa Bay area bombarded the Japanese army positions near Mount Chibyu, advancing east of the area. The Japanese garrison in the Suma area is still securing the Orote Airfield at the narrow part of the front of the peninsula. The enemy forces in the Akashi Bay area were unable to advance due to the Japanese counterattack. The enemy's aircraft were rampant and persistent, making it difficult for the Japanese army to move. On the night of the 25th, the Japanese garrison inflicted great damage on the enemy forces in the Akashi Bay area. Gathering the troops stationed near Mount Chibyu, the entire force, united with the navy, ravaged the enemy's positions and even broke into the west of Akashi Street and Akashi Bay. The navy's attack had terrified the enemy, but the Japanese army's strength was also gradually decreasing. By the 26th, the enemy knew that the Japanese forces were sparse, so they used tanks as the vanguard and broke into the Japanese army's positions along the entire line, gradually occupying the Honda Tund high ground. On the 28th, enemy tanks appeared on the high ground south of Mount Honda. After noon on the same day, the battle situation was extremely fierce. The Japanese army used the forest area in the north of the island to fight stubbornly. On the evening of the 29th, they began to advance. On the evening of the 31st, they reorganized the battle line on the north-south line of Mount Haruta. On August 2, the enemy forces, under the cover of 30 tanks, approached the Japanese army's positions. At this time, the Japanese army's command, communication, and supplies became more and more difficult, and their combat strength gradually decreased. On the 5th, the battle lines were completely mixed up. On the 7th, the remaining 300 soldiers of the army and navy gathered around the headquarters of the Otaki Mountain unit. At that time, there was not a single shot fired. On the night of the same day (8th), those who were injured and unable to stand up completely committed suicide. The next night, the supreme commander personally led the troops to the front line, wielding his sword and slashing into the enemy's ranks near the three roads south of Otaki Mountain. The survivors launched ambush warfare in various local areas. On September 27, the entire army died heroically. Not only the Japanese garrison, but also the construction teams and Japanese expatriates all cooperated to fight fiercely for 68 days. The Japanese army expended enormous enemy strength. When the supreme commander made a surprise attack in the rear, he sent a telegram as follows: The Japanese divine soldiers are extremely vigorous and calm in the face of national crisis. Even under cruel shelling, they chant the Military Code of Conduct every morning, and their dignified voices are enough to shock the heavens and move the ghosts and gods. Every time we hear that our unit's losses have contributed greatly to the overall war situation, we take this as our supreme honor and are determined to die. His Majesty the Emperor has shown us mercy, so we can only be grateful. We believe that Japan will win, and we hope to fight to the end.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Tinian <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>○ On Tinian Island, at 5:00 AM on July 24, enemy forces, under the cover of warships, gathered about 40 ships in front of Tinian Port and about 140 ships on the western peninsula, attempting to land all at once. The Japanese army on Tinian Island immediately launched a fierce battle. Soon, one enemy warship and two destroyers caught fire after being hit, and one enemy cruiser was destroyed. Many landing craft were also destroyed or sunk. The enemy's attempt was in vain, and the enemy forces were completely repelled. The enemy forces near the West Battery on the northwest coast were also repelled. After this, the enemy launched fierce artillery fire, and at the same time, set up large-scale smoke screens along the coast. Under this cover, a part of the enemy forces successfully landed at noon. At dusk on the same day, they advanced to the first and fourth airfields. At this time, the enemy's landing force had reached the level of three infantry battalions, 30 tanks, and one artillery regiment. On the midnight of the same day, the Japanese garrison launched a brave night attack with all their strength, and a part of the enemy's positions were recaptured by the Japanese army. On the 25th, the enemy continued to dispatch reinforcements from Saipan Island under intense shelling, with a force of no less than one division. On the night of the same day, the Japanese army launched another night attack, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. However, because the enemy released a large number of flares, they were unable to fully exert their power, but the enemy's advance was blocked and made no progress. Also, due to the enemy's fierce shelling, the Japanese army suffered increasing damage, so on the evening of the 27th, they bombed the Carolina Highlands battle line and decided to launch a final attack, and formed about 3,000 young Japanese men living on the island, aged 16 to 45, into a volunteer army, and fought fiercely with the Japanese army. On the 30th, the enemy forces advanced to the Third Airfield. At dawn on the 31st, the Japanese army switched to the offensive and launched a fierce battle south of the Third Airfield. This kind of bloody battle continued until dusk on the same day, and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, but the Japanese side also suffered considerable casualties. On the night of the same day, a telegram was sent, the main points of which are as follows: After many brave battles, we have still failed to fulfill our responsibility to defend Tinian Island, and we are extremely ashamed. We are deeply grateful for the long-term education and cultivation of the country and the generous encouragement. Finally, we pray for the prosperity of the Imperial Family and the flourishing of the national fortune. Those who were injured and unable to move all committed suicide heroically. At dusk on the same day, the survivors launched a final attack. For a long period of 60 days after this, they switched to guerrilla warfare until September 27, when all the members died heroically one after another. The Japanese people on Miyako and Tinian Islands regarded death as home, and without fear of hardship, they exerted all their strength to cooperate with the military in combat and fulfilled their aspirations, which is worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>A Certain Base of the Japanese Army Front Line, 30th (Central News Agency) – In order to respond to the Japanese army's land battle, the Japanese navy suddenly landed in a certain place near Wenzhou, a strategic point in the East China Sea, on a certain day. Since the Japanese navy began to operate near the Oujiang River, the bombing of the East China Sea area by the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force has gradually become more frequent. At the same time, the activity of their submarines may also be launched. In order to crush their wild hope of reckless action, the Japanese army first gave them a head-on blow. Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing telegram, a spokesman for the Chongqing army met with reporters on the 29th and admitted that Shi Qing had fallen.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Social Welfare allocated 100,000 yuan to the civilians in the Xiaguan District who were attacked by fire on the 26th, and distributed relief according to the severity of the disaster. The Municipal Welfare Bureau specially allocated more than 10,000 yuan to the civilians injured and treated at the Central Hospital, and sent personnel to the hospital with the money to express condolences.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Communist Leaders Flock to Yan'an <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to Yan'an news received here, the Yan'an Central Office held a reception for military representatives at the Central Auditorium on the 18th. Key members of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and all the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party staying in Yan'an, such as Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Chen Yi, Nie Rongzhen, etc., all attended. At the meeting, Mao Zedong and others criticized the Chongqing side, saying that the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the Henan People's Army are now engaged in fierce fighting with six-fifths of the Japanese army stationed in China, while the Kuomintang army is only fighting one-sixth of the Japanese army stationed in China. In the Henan and Hunan battle lines, the Japanese army entered as if into an unpopulated place. This situation is extremely serious. In short, the reason why China has today is only because the Communist army has a good grasp of the anti-Japanese situation. Those with insight believe that the gathering of the Communist leaders in Yan'an is greatly related to the actual situation of the negotiations in Chongqing, the adjustment of the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and the hopes of the members of the National Political Participation Council for compromise. Therefore, their movements are worthy of attention.</p>

<p>South Russian Army Encroaches on Southeastern Europe</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from London, the Yugoslav guerrillas under Tito broke into Belgrade on the 29th. Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong Agency News: The war on the southern route of the Eastern Front proves that the Soviet army not only wants to cross the Danube into Baoguo and enter Serbia, but also wants to enter Southeastern Europe through the Iron Gate. The Soviet army's attempt to cross the Danube to the south bank in Severin and the Great Danube Bend has been repelled by the German counterattack. In the battle on the Romanian-Hungarian border, the Hungarian army's offensive has forced the Romanian army to take the defensive. In the battle on the outer Transylvanian border, the German army retreated north into new positions on the Szekler line. East of Beskides, the Soviet army is gathering, and the war has greatly decreased. There is only artillery and air combat in the Suwałki region.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Land Subsidence Occurs in South Wales <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, 30th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency: According to [Daily News], cities and towns in South Wales, England, are constantly gradually sinking. The reason is that the ground has been sunk by underground coal mining areas. Some entire villages or small towns have sunk or even disappeared. The extent of the destruction has aroused strong protests from the miners' union. When the surface sinks, walls collapse, windows break, and even roads break and sink. Water pipes, gas pipes, and power lines burst, and bridges sometimes split into two sections.</p>

<p>Minister Matsushima Gave a Speech Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency News – Regarding the heroic sacrifice of the Japanese army and navy units defending Miyako Island and Tinian Island, Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China gave a speech as follows: ○ The Japanese army and navy units defending Miyako Island and Tinian Island, since the enemy appeared in the Saipan area, have assisted the garrison units on the island in fighting the enemy with numerical inferiority. After July 21, the enemy's powerful forces began to land, and the garrison immediately counterattacked, inflicting heavy damage on them. Until September 27, during these 70 days, the Japanese army and navy on the isolated island fiercely attacked the enemy from the sea, land, and air, enduring all hardships and making the enemy afraid. As a result, they completed their mission and made a heroic sacrifice, which is truly hateful. However, the fact that all the soldiers were able to fight to the last man, beyond the enemy's expectations, and exert their maximum combat power is a rare feat in military history. In particular, the resident expatriates who worked together with the garrison and calmly faced death demonstrated our Japanese traditional spirit. After receiving the news, we can only express our heartfelt gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Final Decisive Battle to Annihilate the Enemy <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>When the enemy attempted to counterattack in the Pacific, it was long expected that they would appear in the Mariana Islands. Based on our grand strategic policy, we prepared an ambush posture. However, to annihilate the enemy in the final decisive battle, the following conditions must be met: 1. Appropriately choose the timing of the decisive battle to make the enemy collapse in one blow. 2. Prepare to concentrate sufficient forces to annihilate the enemy. 3. To make it easier to achieve victory, inflict maximum damage on the enemy before the decisive battle. The defending forces in that area, based on the above policy, made heroic sacrifices with the entire army and achieved satisfactory results. The hardships experienced by the soldiers are truly beyond description, even to a small degree, and this will become clear as it is gradually announced. Fighting to the last man and the last weapon to complete the assigned mission is the spirit of our Japanese Imperial Army. They overcame everything in the fierce battle on Guangzhong Road in Shanghai in August of Showa 12 and in the greatest crisis of the Shanghai Naval Landing Force, demonstrating this spirit. This is incomparable to MacArthur, who abandoned his subordinates and fled to the Corregidor fortress. The enemy can also deeply recognize the fighting spirit of the Japanese army. Nimitz and MacArthur have repeatedly pointed out the difficulties in the future of the Pacific war. On September 26, General Krueger, commander of the ground forces of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, also greatly praised the Japanese army. ○ The fall of Omiya Island and Tinian Island is truly regrettable, but judging from the above grand policy, the missions they were assigned have been fully achieved. Therefore, our strategic posture will not be shaken in the slightest. On the contrary, it will cause significant losses to the enemy, and we can obtain detailed information to assess the enemy's combat capabilities, which will be more helpful for future operations. ○ The enemy's counterattack in the Pacific recently suffered a major setback on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, and before September 23, it had already suffered losses equivalent to the capture of Saipan Island. Two hospital ships of 10,000 tons were loaded with dead and wounded soldiers. This can be said to be the prelude to the future war situation. This is all due to the strategic effect obtained by the struggle of the Japanese army on Saipan, Omiya, and Tinian Islands.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Countless Astonishing Deeds <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>○ Regarding the defending forces of Tinian and Omiya Islands, there are countless earth-shattering deeds. What makes me particularly grateful is that senior special agents continuously sent valuable reports to help with future operations, even after communication was cut off, which can be glimpsed in the enemy's announcements. ○ The enemy has been propagandizing that they have begun to attack the Philippines, but according to a Washington telegram on the 25th, the enemy plans to cut off the connection between the occupied areas and the Japanese mainland in the following steps: 1. Invade the Philippines, 2. Invade the Malay Peninsula, 3. Occupy various strongholds along the Chinese coast, 4. Capture the Kuril Islands, etc. However, the above are all unrealizable empty theories. Even if the war situation evolves to what extent, our decisive battle posture will become increasingly solid under the uprising of inland naval and army soldiers and one hundred million compatriots, and we will have more confidence in the final victory. ○ Today, we received the tragic news of the heroic soldiers and all overseas Chinese on Omiya Island and Tinian Island being destroyed, which is extremely sad. However, this can further encourage our courageous hearts to advance towards victory. ○ The discerning people of China also understand that recently the enemy has been engaging in various political conspiracies, attempting to use the development in the northwestern region of China as an anti-Japanese military industrial base. This can be understood from the visit of the two envoys, Nelson and Hurley, to Chongqing. If this is realized, it will drag China into the vortex of war, and the result will inevitably be scorched earth, reducing and exterminating the people of both China and Japan, which is a double-edged poisonous plan. In the future, we should be vigilant. The Japanese people should have the determination to fight to the last person, as demonstrated on Omiya Island and Tinian Island. Future operations must be carried out in the vast ocean or on the mainland. Therefore, Britain and the United States cannot easily advance. We firmly believe that today is an excellent opportunity to destroy the enemy, and we are willing to fully cooperate.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Respectful Condolences to the Spirits of the Two Colonels <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima also talked about the past to commemorate the death of Colonel Kazuo Ohya and Colonel Yutaka Matsumoto, the commanders of the Japanese garrison on Omiya and Tinian Islands: [Colonel Kazuo Ohya and Colonel Yutaka Matsumoto were both graduates of the 46th class of the Naval Academy. Colonel Ohya was a navigation expert with a martial spirit. He also served in the Special Affairs Department Management Section of the Shanghai Military Attache Office and the Asia Development Board. Later, he was assigned to defend Tinian until now. He was an expert in martial arts, and to promote the spirit of martial arts, his death this time was also a worthwhile death. When I was a lieutenant, I worked with him on the 7th Destroyer, and he often used his proud words, "[Don't be such a fool]." This affectionate and intimate saying is still in my ears. I also had a close relationship with Colonel Matsumoto. In Taisho 15, we both worked at the Yokosuka Naval Barracks, and then we both worked at the Maizuru Training Department. In September of Showa 1, we both worked at the Sasebo Naval Personnel Department. We had close relationships in both public and private matters. He was an excellent and talented person. Because of a chest injury along the way, he often hoped to go to the front lines. He was very excited when he heard that he was being sent from the Sasebo Naval Personnel Department to the Omiya team garrison, but unexpectedly, that place turned out to be his final place of death, which is truly full of emotion. Finally, I would like to extend my respectful condolences to the spirits of the two heroes].</p>

<h3 id="e18">Hope Merchants Will Obey Measures for Suppressing Rice Transportation Commissioner Goshima Explains Rice Purchasing Policy <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the suppression of rice transportation, Commissioner Goshima of the Economic Security Department made the following statement yesterday: The Rice Control Association previously formulated the Outline of Temporary Measures for Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai and the Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for the Citizens based on the outline as emergency measures to implement the rice needs of the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai. Passports were issued to rice transporters entering the Shanghai urban area, and more than a dozen rice import ports were established on the Shanghai control line to prevent illegal activities such as smuggling rice and evading requisition. Since the implementation, the rice situation has improved recently, and the countermeasures of the Rice Control Association have also been properly planned. It has been decided to abolish the national law restricting rice entering the Shanghai urban area. For personal use, rice within eight kilograms can be moved freely. The above sections have been promulgated by the Rice Control Association on September 21 to inform everyone and attract the attention of general transporters. However, this intention has not been thoroughly implemented, and violations continue to occur, which is deeply regrettable. This measure is an important policy to guide the smooth purchase of rice in the interior. I hope the general public understands this and strictly obeys it. The authorities stipulate that if illegal activities such as smuggling are found in the future, once verified, they will be severely punished. I hope merchants will exercise caution.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Officials and Civilians in Manchuria Strive to Increase Production During the War <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Jicheng Talks About His Arrival in Shanghai Mr. Chen Jicheng, our country's ambassador to Manchuria, recently returned home to report on his work. A reporter specially visited Mr. Chen at his Shanghai residence and published the following statement: [At this time of war, the stability of the lives of the people of Manchuria, the effort to achieve self-sufficiency in essential living materials, the establishment of security, and the rapid progress of construction are praised by the countries of East Asia. However, what is most admirable is that even though Manchuria is at war, domestic prices are extremely low, and at the same time, everyone from top to bottom is consistent and there is no partiality. From last year to now, the whole country, from the government to the public, has wholeheartedly devoted itself to increasing production during the war. Regardless of officials, students, or people from the industrial and commercial sectors, they all sincerely follow national policies, work diligently, and contribute to the public, and move towards the goal of part-time work and part-time study, and even farming. For example, industrial and commercial employees are busy with store affairs, but they also serve the country and engage in diligent and public service work, while their positions are replaced by female students. Therefore, the results are quite good. Therefore, the whole country is working together to increase production, and this point is the biggest reason for creating low prices. Our country should emulate it as a lesson. In addition, the electricity in Manchuria is powered by hydropower, so wartime production is absolutely unaffected. Therefore, various industries can proceed smoothly. For example, heavy industry, mining, steelmaking, coal mining, etc., have seen a particularly large increase in production. Secondly, vegetables are extremely cheap, such as pork selling for one yuan per catty, sorghum rice selling for one dime per catty, and ten yuan per stone. Therefore, prices are low and people's lives are stable. Under the current wartime system, we are working hard with one heart and one mind to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, Manchuria's air defense system is also worth learning from. Since May of last year, it has already received great results. The spirit of defense is high, and the thoroughness of training has made amazing progress, which can be said to be doing its best], he said. It is also learned that the task of Ambassador Chen's return to China is to report to the National Government and participate in this year's Double Ten National Day ceremony. He will make a special trip to Nanjing the day after tomorrow to attend. Once completed, he will go to Manchuria to resume his duties.</p>

<p>Chairman Chen Ziyi first gave a speech to open the meeting, saying: This association has been ordered to reorganize from the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, and the mission it bears is more important than before, and the materials it provides are narrower than before. If we do not seize the time to engage in collection, and if the colleagues in various regions do not warmly support us, we will not be able to ensure the necessary quantity of the plan. Therefore, we plan to establish offices in various regions to quickly promote business. However, this association stands on the position of merchant self-governance and control. For certain measures, we must also consult with the wise leaders of the colleagues in various regions to jointly discuss them. At the meeting, we can hear reports on the actual situation in the interior, so that this association can make realistic adjustments to the best of its ability, and on the one hand, solicit opinions from various regions to clarify the flow route of oil and grain and establish a sound control countermeasure.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Foundation for the Combined Fleet's Inevitable Victory <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Yamamoto, Naval Reporting Staff</p>
<p>Whenever I meet with Chinese journalists, I am invariably asked: [How is the Japanese Combined Fleet doing?] Perhaps this question is not limited to the Chinese, but it is an extremely elusive question. To this, I can only reply: [Of course, the Combined Fleet is in its proper place, doing what it should be doing.] But on the other side of this indifferent question, there is indeed a more fundamental reason. The Japanese Navy's Combined Fleet, which has been advertised as extremely powerful throughout the world, has remained completely silent regarding large-scale actions by the enemy fleet since the American Pacific Fleet attacked the Gilbert Islands last November, followed by the landing operations in the Marshall Islands in February of this year, the landing operations in the Admiralty Islands in March, and the landing operations in the Mariana Islands from June to July-August. There is a desire to understand the truth of this matter. However, to clearly understand the situation, one must first fully understand the changes in the enemy's strength, especially the naval strength, generally expressed in terms of quantity. Due to space limitations, I cannot list detailed figures, but in terms of the number of ships newly completed last year, according to the figures announced by Secretary of the Navy Forrestal (then Under Secretary of the Navy) in January of this year:</p>
<h3 id="e42">Changes in Enemy Strength <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Ships Completed in 1943: Battleships: 2 (Iowa and New Jersey) Aircraft Carriers: 65 (6 standard, 9 converted from cruisers, 50 escort carriers) Cruisers: 11 Destroyers: 128 Submarines: 56 Escort Destroyers: 306 Total: 568 That is, the enemy built an average of one and a half ships per day last year. This announcement may be a bit exaggerated, but after the Pearl Harbor disaster, the enemy spared no expense and worked diligently, actively engaging in shipbuilding, and finally achieved this result after two years. This is not only the case with ships, but also with aircraft. Just refer to the number of aircraft carriers completed in the aforementioned announcement, and it will become clear.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Completion of Preparations for Inner Line Operations <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>However, our Navy is not unaware of the enemy Navy's increased shipbuilding. Needless to say, we also have new ships being built successively, but we cannot compete with the United States in terms of quantity, so we will not continue to engage in a war of attrition. Therefore, with changes in the balance of power, a periodic shift in the Combined Fleet's strategy is naturally required. Thus, our Combined Fleet will temporarily not target the enemy fleet as its primary opponent. The enemy fleet sees our Combined Fleet as a thorn in its side and is eager to remove it, taking advantage of the enemy fleet's opportunity to attack the Western Pacific to destroy it in one fell swoop. The so-called inner line operations posture has been prepared. It has been almost a year since entering this inner line operation. During this period, how much unexpected wealth has the enemy captured in the Pacific? This is a very interesting question. In the battles of the Gilbert, Marshall, Admiralty, and Mariana Islands, our army lost approximately 20,000 to 30,000 men, while the enemy's losses were definitely no less than 50,000 to 60,000. Furthermore, the enemy has occupied many small islands such as Tarawa, Makin, Kwajalein, Roi-Namur, and Saipan, but the price they paid includes many excellent ships such as battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers being sunk or damaged. Perhaps the sum of the deck area of these lost or damaged ships is equal to the sum of the land area of the aforementioned islands. The only point here is that the enemy's front line is gradually approaching our homeland, which can be regarded as the enemy's only gain. However, this also means that the enemy's front line is gradually moving away from its own country, i.e., the lengthening of the supply line. In naval operations on the ocean, the lengthening of the supply line is extremely unfavorable, and the degree of disadvantage is, in principle, proportional to the square of the length of the supply line. Transport ships carrying weapons, ammunition, food, and all other military supplies travel long distances, and their hardship can be imagined. On the contrary, from our perspective, the enemy's approach can be regarded as a concrete manifestation of the progress of our inner line operations. That is, the perfect opportunity to completely annihilate the enemy fleet closest to our own logistical base, in its most favorable waters, is gradually approaching. Looking at it this way, during the past year of the enemy fleet's reckless actions, there have been no operational setbacks on our side. Everyone remembers this fact very clearly, right? Those who have not deeply considered the meaning of the aforementioned inner line operations will naturally ask questions such as [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] This is very worrying.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Combined Fleet is Bound to Win <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the strength of the Combined Fleet, there is no need to elaborate here. Even if the Combined Fleet were to immediately challenge the main force of the enemy fleet today, I believe it could win. But the most important thing is that this [believe] is [difficult]. The previous chart described the enemy's military production capacity, which will continue to grow not only this year but also in the coming years. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Combined Fleet, in the unlikely event of failure, must achieve complete victory with a success rate of one thousand percent or ten thousand percent. That is, not only victory, but the method of victory is also subject to conditions. [Inevitable Victory] is not just a conceptual meaning related to the Combined Fleet. The original meaning and weight of those words are fully contained within them. The Japanese Navy sits solemnly in a formation as solemn as a forest. Today, from Commander-in-Chief Toyoda down to the lowest-ranking sailor, the meaning of these two words is deeply ingrained, and they are not to be taken lightly. And the meaning of questions such as [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] can naturally be understood. During the enemy's landing operation on Saipan, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō encouraged the Navy, saying: [In Kendo, there is a style called Ungang, which requires using this spirit when striking each other.] But I believe striking each other is the opposite. When striking each other, one cannot avoid suffering a few blows. Therefore, in certain situations, one must swallow one's pride, endure, and exercise self-restraint. This has been the inner line operation for the past year, and we will continue to remain calm, waiting for the opportunity for a true single strike. Only in this way can we consistently unleash the true essence of inner line operations.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Air Power is the Key to Victory or Defeat <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the enemy has been gradually approaching the area where they will launch their counteroffensive in the Philippines. The battles in the Moluccas and Palau Islands are their preliminary battles. What we cannot ignore here is the issue of air power between us and the enemy. Generally speaking, when one mentions the Navy, everyone thinks of the grandeur of the ships, which is natural, as the main body of the Navy is ultimately the ships. But we must not forget that in naval battles, air power represents extreme importance. The United States, which suffered a disastrous defeat at Pearl Harbor at the beginning of the war, gradually recognized the importance of air power at sea and has since actively worked to strengthen its air power. The performance of the various aircraft currently in use is quite excellent, which we can frankly admit. And their numbers, despite continuous damage from brave interception, are quite sufficient. I said before: [Even if the Combined Fleet were to immediately challenge the main force of the enemy fleet today, I believe it could win.] But the [believe] may result in an unexpected outcome. What could cause that unlikely event? What I am worried about is only the difference in air power between us and the enemy. No matter how invincible and strong the Combined Fleet is, it may be defeated without realizing it due to the balance of air power between us and the enemy. Therefore, someone concerned about [How is the Combined Fleet doing?] should fundamentally view it as [a manifestation of the state of Japanese aircraft production]. At this time, it is meaningful to reveal the aviation center of gravity theory of Alexander de Seversky, an American aviation expert. In his book "Victory Through Air Power," Seversky criticized the authorities for their lack of understanding of air power. [How to value air power, even a month after the Pearl Harbor attack, has not yet been imprinted in the outdated minds of the authorities. Even when submitting a huge budget to Congress, a senior general claimed: [We will use this budget to destroy the enemy's naval power and secure sea control.] This statement openly exposes the poverty of the authorities' strategic concepts. And not only members of Congress, but also the media and public opinion have affirmed this statement. This kind of statement makes it very easy for us to understand how irresponsible they are. Assuming that [destroying the enemy's naval power] is possible, but will we be able to [ensure sea control] with just this? Furthermore, after [destroying the naval power], will our fleet be able to break into Japanese waters, bombard harbors, submarine bases, or coastal fortresses? The answer is a complete no.</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Enemy's Advance is Like Casting Themselves into a Net <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>If Japan maintains effective air power, this kind of offensive operation will inevitably be like casting themselves into a net, entering the sphere of activity of air power departing from land-based bases, which is an act of suicide. After destroying the Japanese fleet, can we cut off Japan's transportation lines to the Asian continent? Can our fleet majestically advance into the Sea of Japan, float in the Taiwan Strait, or in the waters off the Chinese coast blockaded by Japan? As long as air power exists from Japanese land-based bases, our fleet will suffer total annihilation. Moreover, after our fleet has destroyed the enemy fleet, can we regain the Philippines, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the islands near Australia? The answer is another [no]. As long as the enemy's air power exists in these places, no matter how many ships our fleet has, it cannot enter this area. In short, if Japan maintains a strong air force and secures air supremacy, then even if Japan's naval power is defeated, it will have no effect. Our fleet cannot approach any sea area dominated by enemy air power.] The above is the principle of the current air-sea strategy in the Pacific. Adherence to principles is most important in war. The importance of air power has been made very clear by Seversky, and there is no need to say more. Now, being able to use the largest possible number of air power in all sea areas of the Pacific, starting from the Philippines, is the most important foundation for the Combined Fleet's inevitable victory. The actual battle situation is waxing and waning, developing day by day within this line of thought. (Translated by Yi)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Life and Work—To My Brothers <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Hong Ying</p>
<p>XX: You must be thinking: I must be a lucky person. Indeed, for a young man who has only been out of school for twenty days, to find a way out in a blind rush, to find a path through the thorns, and to stride into society to do his own profession is very fortunate. Moreover, you think my life is very peaceful and comfortable, and that I will no longer be overwhelmed by boredom as I used to be. In fact, quite the opposite, the result of these past two weeks of work has changed my state of mind, [the mood of life is ultimately different]. This is the most obvious point. I am not telling you that the taste of life is sour, sweet, or bitter..., because the evaluation of life varies from person to person. But my soul—you have always called me a restless child—naturally wants to tell you. You will always understand why I seek a profession, for the current situation, for the restless life, for the painful words of my father who has been struck by heavy worries: [Son, I am being suffocated by life...] I resolutely, and also under compulsion, am walking the path I am now on. You also understand me, my lifelong wish is not in my current profession. The people in the current professional circle, those Philistines, are what I usually hate and despise; and the surroundings, which are always filled with the stench of money, are what I deeply loathe. But, [for life, for food, for muddling through the days], I have thrown myself into a place I didn't want to go! Having lived in this circle, I have no choice but to [adapt to the environment], so my change is very likely. However, I can say with certainty: the environment can only change my appearance, but it cannot change my heart. Apart from temporarily being a parasite to get through the difficult times, there is no other purpose or hope attached to this place. My current life is simply a waste of time and a squandering of life; the meaninglessness of the work causes my soul pain. Every minute I feel like I am shackled, forever sitting in a prison. In the office, all kinds of faces, all kinds of expressions, those acts of jealousy, flattery, hatred... all kinds of despicable behaviors are played out every moment, which makes me have a great antipathy. Those mediocre people, sitting in chairs, leisurely smoking cigarettes, chatting about everything! They talk about stocks, women, playing cards, and New Year's operas. In short, they are representatives of all decadent lifestyles, which make me even more disgusted. Some people say: If a young person runs into society and tries to cope with the environment in the same way as before, he will surely fail and return; only by catering to the trend, recognizing people, and pleasing superiors can he have smooth sailing and rise step by step. I will never do this. My character, which absolutely refuses to lower my personality for no reason, remains stubbornly intact. Although I have been working for half a month, I have never given those snobbish people a flattering smile or said a cowardly word. I have done what I should do, and I never want to pursue those things that are not my duty or not proper. When I see many people—those dogs of the world—doing things blindly without purpose; their hearts are filled with suspicion and fear; their means are cunning and vicious; their existence has no goal, only means; they have not thought about the obligation to do a little responsibility for humanity, but only covet pleasure and pursue money; for the sake of blind desires, they sell their souls and lose their personalities. I and these people stand at two extremes, like water and fire, there is no place to reconcile; my moral concepts and ideal life are different from theirs. Therefore, I am lonely. Sometimes, my appearance is ridiculed by them, they think I am so stupid, so foolish, and do not understand the ways of the world. This ridicule does not cause my antipathy and hatred. I do not retaliate against them—of course, this is not non-resistance, but these people do not need to be resisted; as long as I occasionally look back at them in the future, these people must have fallen into the abyss of darkness, degenerated to the point of death. However, unfortunately, things finally happened. I am a child whose soul is unwilling to be lonely. I am going to seek a full life, an ideal life; therefore, whenever I feel that there is a possibility of using time, I read books—in this way, it will not hinder the efficiency of work at all—one day, a fat director came over and said: [You cannot read books during office hours]. He did not give a reason for not being able to read books and left. My heart was very angry and painful; but I endured it, I did not rebel against him. Another day, after office hours, I was concentrating on reading, and it happened that I didn't pay attention to a small matter. A deputy director said with a straight face: [You are really stupid, you can't even move your hands, you are always holding a book]. This is simply a kind of snobbery, an insult to my personality, but I still endured it and did not rebel against him. [Working this kind of job, young people no longer have the freedom they used to have.] I thought. But I am not desperate or sad because of this. People should endure something for the sake of life. Moreover, one should not have a negative attitude towards life. Things like cursing, retreating, and disgust are all great sins; only by actively struggling and strengthening oneself is a good method. Life is so tortuous, the road of life is endless, and to reach the ideal paradise, one must face reality and move forward bravely. Young people, who doesn't want to live a free reading life, who doesn't want to create their own ideal life. Although I am doing work that violates my interests and have lost the opportunity to study, I still fantasize about a bright future. I am confident in the following words, namely: [School education follows general laws and establishes its curriculum accordingly. Its highest purpose, although to seek the ideal happy life of mankind, in fact, it trains the basic or mediocre people of society; general special or genius people educate themselves in any difficult environment, learn from lessons, from work, and create and develop towards the goal of personal ideals.] I don't know if you have read the words of an author, he wrote: [People seem to be dogs for the sake of life, but there are other desires besides life.] Unable to deny my own contradiction, I think the people around me are dogs, then I also have the possibility of becoming a dog. —Observed from the objective standpoint of a third party, I may be a dog in appearance. But, I have a soul, I have a pure heart: current work and life are two different things, I have a desire for a noble life outside of life; this environment, this work, cannot hinder the progress of my heart, on the contrary, this environment trains me to get closer to the life I desire. In any case, the turbid air can only harm my lungs, but it cannot harm my heart; similarly, the bad environment can only give me a blow, a good opportunity to work hard, and I will never submit to it. The current life has increased my inner toughness and strengthened my beliefs; the lessons that reality has given me make me grit my teeth and clench my fists. The value of a person's life is determined by his work. The unintentional work today is a way to seek a future life, just like a drop of dew in the morning sun, occupying a very small amount of time. In the future, when I move from this environment to another, it will certainly no longer be [for food, for muddling through the days]. It is living for work. And for the current life, I feel that it is just leaving a trace in the history of life.</p>
<h3 id="e48">On Contrast <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ke</p>
<p>To make something blacker without adding black to it, one only needs to add some white around or behind it, or place a white object next to it. At that time, the black object will look much deeper than before. This is the principle of contrast in art. It seems that most people already know this principle and can even apply it to real life. They know that making others suffer is the only way to make their own good fortune stand out, and slandering others is the only way to make their own nobility stand out. Therefore, they desperately say all kinds of bad things about their colleagues in the ears of managers or high-ranking employees, adding more and more details, and even fabricating them at all costs, in order to highlight their own diligence, selflessness, accomplishment, and reliability, so as to gain favor and preferment. They unreasonably oppress and push people into the water, yet they are smugly thinking that they are highlighting their own authority. Those who are forced to the point of having nowhere to go and those who are injured and unemployed by slander thus arise. Those with weaker wills may even take the last step in life—degenerating and committing suicide. Self-righteous people! Don't you think that only you know the principle of contrast in the world? He knows how to use this method on others, can't a third party use a more clever method on him? The so-called [there is always someone stronger than the strong], [the wicked will be tormented by the wicked]. Isn't that the ultimate truth of retribution? For example, if the color of the contrast object is the same as that of the contrasted object, and the color of the contrast object is deeper than that of the contrasted object, then the color of the contrasted object will feel lighter. Just like an electric light, it is bright and dazzling at night, but it loses its effect in the daytime. In the same way, people who use all their tricks will also taste the pain of those who have been tormented by them at this time!</p>

<h3 id="e50">Football Player Registration Issues <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— By Yi Xian</p>
<p>Pan Sansheng, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, spoke to a reporter about the issue of football player registration, expressing his views frankly and objectively. A summary is as follows: [Since the Shanghai Football Association was taken over by Chinese management last session, I have been mistakenly elected as Vice Chairman. Lacking talent and experience, I am ashamed to have made few contributions. Although football in Shanghai has flourished and been extremely popular for a time, deeply ingrained bad habits are difficult to break. In the past year, the Football Association has strived to improve, but due to being newly established, it has been difficult to fully meet expectations. The current organizational structure has been readjusted, and we sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will supervise us. We are determined to adhere to our original intentions and strive for reform. The registration process for this year's football league has been completed and the competition will begin next weekend. Unfortunately, the practice of teams "poaching" players is still prevalent, as in the past. In running a football team, it is essential to focus on spirit and morality, so as not to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of promoting sports. The championship is secondary. Last year, I founded the Sansheng Football Team, which took a lot of effort, because all the players were young and inexperienced, with no famous names. However, they did not have the bad habits of the time and were willing to learn humbly, so their skills improved visibly. Although their record in the last season was mediocre, their spirit was commendable, which I found gratifying. Unexpectedly, some players were poached by other teams for this season. Hearing this, I was moved. Think of how much effort it takes to nurture a fledgling talent. By the time their wings are strong, they suddenly fly away, which cannot but disappoint the organizers. According to the players, they were forced to switch teams due to work-related reasons, which is unreasonable. Every organization should employ people based on their abilities. How can football be used as an excuse? As for employees, if they are always loyal, diligent, and conscientious in their duties, they will surely be valued by their superiors. This has nothing to do with football. Therefore, I do not believe that this is the case. "Poaching" is an act that destroys teams and benefits oneself at the expense of others. For example, this year, a new team was originally formed. However, to attract famous players, it was necessary to break up the strength of other teams. After efforts from all sides and myself to mediate, the plan was abandoned. The practice of "poaching" has existed for a long time, and we should try to eliminate and dissuade it within the possible range. Regarding the issue of regulating players and teams, Chairman Shen has proposed and the board of directors has passed a resolution stating that "players who were registered with a team last year cannot be transferred to another team this year without the permission of the team's responsible person, otherwise they will be suspended from playing this season." As the saying goes, "To correct a wrong, one must go beyond the norm." This difficult situation is also a last resort.] Phoenix Cup Basketball Championship</p>
<h3 id="e51">Hua Ying Movie Star Basketball Player Records <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— By Jie Mei</p>
<p>The Hua Ying basketball team has a short history. In the beginning, they played among the second-tier teams and were not particularly outstanding. Later, after Qian Xucang was hired as a coach, and with the efforts of the team members, their skills improved rapidly day by day. In the past, they were appreciated by fans in the Central Youth and Western Youth Leagues. Recently, in the Phoenix Cup Basketball League organized by the Peicheng Electric Factory, Zhang Juefei, the director of physical education at Gezhi Middle School, was in charge of everything and the league has concluded successfully. Mr. Zhang single-handedly achieved this result, worthy of a veteran. The Hua Ying team also joined the A-group of the league. Relying on the efforts of everyone, they won every game, overwhelming all the strong teams (other teams lost at least twice). It can be seen that their success was not accidental. They became famous in one fell swoop. I am particularly happy to write records of the basketball stars. Wu Wenchao—is the team manager, handles affairs properly, coordinates well, and does not avoid running around. He is deeply trusted by the players. Lao Wu has made a great contribution to the team's success. Shu Shi—is the team captain, personally participating in every game, fighting seriously, and never slacking off. Bao Songwei—is a good defender. He is very obedient to the instructions of the coach, management, and captain, so his performance is normal. Li Zhenzhong—was originally a national player, so he is familiar with the game. He blends the agility of the South with the strength of the North, possessing both. Gao Mangsheng—is known as Gao Backshot in the basketball circle. When he shoots, he leans back and shoots, never missing. It is a great move! Qian Xucang—Among the coaches in Shanghai who are worth mentioning, there are Wu Zibin, Yu Xunzi, and Qian Xucang. In the past, he coached the Guoguang, Red Team, and Huqing teams, all with outstanding results. Recently, he coached the Yuan Team women's team, winning three championships in a row, which is something to be proud of. If a basketball team is a film and a coach is a director, then Xucang should be a top-notch director.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Essentials of Basketball Theory (I) <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— By Liang Zhaoan</p>
<p>—In recent years, basketball in Shanghai has developed exceptionally well. Various leagues are held throughout the year. The number of participating teams often reaches sixty or seventy, and the audience it attracts is second only to football, which is a good phenomenon. However, although interest in basketball has penetrated deeply into the public, and the organization of teams has also increased dramatically, it is still questionable whether the level of basketball has improved. Most players are still very naive in their understanding of basketball theory, basic movements, and offensive and defensive strategies. This is due to the lack of basketball reference books and qualified instructors in the market. At the urging of various parties, I will write this article based on what I learned from Professor Hickox at Springfield College in the United States, and my more than twenty years of experience teaching basketball. It will be divided into ○ The History of Basketball Development; ○ Basic Individual Offensive Techniques; ○ Team Offensive Strategies; ○ Modern Defensive Methods, etc. It will be published in installments. If time permits, I will gradually introduce other famous basketball tactics. However, it is written in haste, and errors are inevitable. I hope that knowledgeable people will not hesitate to point them out.</p>
<h3 id="e53">○ The History of Basketball Development <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Basketball does not have a long history among the various major sports. It was first created in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith of Springfield College in Massachusetts, USA, which is the YMCA College. At that time, the Springfield authorities felt that the lack of indoor sports in winter affected the health of young students. Dr. Gulick, the head of sports training in Springfield, urged Mr. Naismith to design an indoor sport that was suitable for the times and easy to develop universally. Mr. Naismith referred to an Indian game, Lacrosse, and football as the basis for organizing basketball. Initially, the basket used was a peach basket, the ball used was a football, and there were no regulations or restrictions on the size of the field or the number of players. To avoid the danger of blocking and collisions, Mr. Naismith did not allow players to walk with the ball. Players could only roll the ball on the ground. After a considerable period of evolution, it became the dribbling action used today. (To be continued)</p>
