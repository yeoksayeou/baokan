<h3>代論　答客問</h3>
<p>— 陳彬酥</p>
<p>從河南會戰說到占領衡陽</p>
<p>問：最誌亞歐兩洲的戰事，已紹進入決戰階段，但是最值得我們重視的，還是我們中國大陸戰塲的新形勢，從河南會戰一直到長沙衡陽的攻陷，改變了整個戰局，請問道次作戰的眞實意義如何爭？</p>
<p>答：中國戰場，始終是決定大東亞戰爭前途的主要戰場，其一動一靜，與整個戰局息息相關。盟邦日本爲了解除本國所受威脅，保障已得的戰果，摧毀敵方的謀略，完遂大東亞戰爭的目的，因而確保及擴展中國大陸的勝利態勢，是必然的。所以這次河南及湖南作戰，在整個戰局上具有決定的作用。</p>
<p>問：現在日軍於河南會戰及長沙衡陽二役，獲得勝利，在戰略上有什麽重要的成就？</p>
<p>答：州最天的成就是開始粉碎了反軸心國在歐亞兩洲鑄時進行反攻的戰略，不僅阻止敵人進攻日本本土的行動，而且也給予歐洲軸心國以截大的協力。敵美太平洋艦隊司令官尼米姿，一向主張利用中國大陸以進攻日本本土，現在中驟大截酌戰略主動權已完全操在日軍之手，由於洛陽長沙衡陽的佔領，更使從華南至華北的中國戰縐大動脈完全為日軍所掌握，尼米資利用中國大陸的計劃巳完全破裂。終時，敵美西南太平洋司令長官麥克沃塞所進行的跳島作戰，由新幾內亞婆羅洲菲律賓而至華南的戰略，亦由此次中國戰塲情勢之劇烈變化而在側面受到嚴重的威脅。所以從大東亞戰局觀察，這次戰役的成就，無異為未來決戰奠立最後勝利的基礎。</p>
<p>問：對於重慶方面的影響一定也不小吧？</p>
<p>答：一般的說，約有四點：第一，重慶統治下的人民，以至全部中國人民，因而不相信蔣介石的力量，對於以往重慶揚言反攻，確是虛張聲勢，捉此得到一個有力的反證。第二，所謂英美援渝，完全造口意而實不至的騙局，離開中日和平的謀略，從此根本失去一般人民的信仰。第三，重　政權中間反對拖戰及抨擊英美的勢力，今後必趨抬頭，磨擦益力。第四，英美利用中國大陸攻擊日本的企圖，從此粉碎。</p>
<p>其次，就軍事上言，以洛陽為中心的中原戰區，一向是拱衛重慶後方的大堡壘，同時也是準備所謂「反攻」的第一綫，華北方面活躍的游擊部隊，亦資以維持接濟。現在旣為日軍掌握，不僅華北治安有了更確實的保障，日軍且已打開了進軍潼關抑制西北的大門。長沙的戰略意義，更高出洛陽，日軍佔領以後，在夸漢路以東諸省，渝方勢力巳完全孤立，其軍事的崩潰，計日可待。特別是從衡陽接踵而陷之後，日軍更已處於直接進攻西南諸省的優勝地位。同時也就是說重慶愈處終困難的地位。况且湖南省的礦產與米糧，最為富庶，長沙衡陽的佔領，控制了湖南全域，在戰時經濟上尤具極大的價值。另一方面，京漢粵漢兩鐵路可以接通，從東京朝鮮滿洲北京漢口廣州越南泰國以至昭南島，可以完成大東亞全域的鐵道幹綫，其意義與價值尤値注意。</p>
<p>問：那麽，這次作戰，在政治上的成就也是很大的嗎？</p>
<p>答：洛陽、長沙、衡陽等大都市，就不說歷史上的意義如何東大，單就目前的地位而論，洛陽為中原大陸的政治中心，誰佔領該地，誰就有控制中原全域的可能，至於長沙，尤為華中華南革命運動的中心，在戰時叉握聯系華東華西各區的政治樞紐。只要打開地圖州看，現在日軍已經掌握平漢，夸漢的交通禎，而衡陽又為奧漢鐵路的大站，湘桂鐵路的起點，因此贑，閩，桂，夸，川，黔各省，已入日軍直接控制的範圍之內，同時亦使蘇，浙，皖，贛，閩，夸諸省與「抗戰」總根據地的西南完全斷絕關係。這裹就具有政治上兩大要義：　從此重慶愈陷於孤立，成為名符其實的地方政權，　和平區政治勢力從此可以仲展。所以，中國統一的理論，已接近實現的階段·</p>
<p>問：請問其前途趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：盟邦陸海空軍這次作戰的勝利，巳經開始打破了敵人反攻日本的戰略，已經加强了大東亞戰爭必勝的態勢，同時也改變了整個中國的政治軍事和經濟的形勢·不過，軍寨的勝利必須繼續擴大，使敵美絕對無法利用中國大陸戰塲；同時，軍事的勝利，必須總政治上的努力加以保障和擴展，所謂政治酌努力，當然希望國民政府乘此有利形勢，澈底革新政治，改善民生，復興戰區，推進建設，提高全國人民對和平地區的政治信仰·特別使日軍解放地區的人民，極迅速地霑受到眞正的仁政的恩澤，對於抗戰與和平政策，獲得正確的印象而知所扶擇·只有這樣磚中國統一的理想才會實現，所謂協力完遂大東亞戰爭，才會有眞實的效果。我們必須在日本軍事上的勝利之後，緊接著展開政治的新勝利·</p>

<p>湖南前錢日軍某基地二十九總中央社電沿粤漢綫南下進攻衡陽之日軍進擊部隊，曾於二十六日未明三面突入湘江東岸之衡陽飛機塲，即中完全佔鎮。於是在渝美空軍有力之一基地，已歸日軍掌握。又自湘江西岸南進中之日軍，其以部緻對折陽飛織塲對岸之衡陽市街巳北西南三面，予以完全包圍，故被園之渝第十及九六兩師主力，雖賴空中堡壘掩護，織續抵抗，然已入重圍，日軍刻展開殲滅戰。</p>
<h3>渝方發表爭奪戰况</h3>
<p>里斯本二十九日中央社電　合衆社重慶訪員，二十八日說明衡陽戰況稱，渝軍當局會於二十八日夜，以戰况公戰，發表衡陽爭奪戰，目下在全巿周圍進展中，此實足以暗示日軍正圍攻衡陽之　實，良以衡陽之喪失，在重慶實為一九三八年十月廣州漢口失陷以來最震大之打擊，由於衡陽之喪失，渝軍重要基地韶關，及渝桂省府所在地桂林之進擊路終已吿打開矣。</p>

<h3>河南前綫從軍記</h3>
<p>往洛陽，往洛陽，兵馬通宵不睡，節節進擊。接連一個半月的征程，夜行軍，大休息，行軍又夜行軍，戰『，轉進，大休息，所以日落紮營的事，一次也沒有。三小時四小時的大休息，要飼馬，要造飯，又要睡眠，在短短的時間內，又要準備明日的新戰鬥。幸而兵和屬都富於忍耐性，善戰善進，整整四日間，不足九十小時以上的睡眠，為搜索敵人而前進。終於在五月二十五日這天，與敵方有力部隊遭遇，展開激戰，攻略洛陽揚威的某某鐵　部隊兵團，足足有一個半月，進行不眠不休的長征。記者此次隨鐵騎部隊，長征一千公里，實地體騐了戰鬥的種種情形，略記如後：</p>
<h3>跨上征途</h3>
<p>五月二日午前二時，我們奉了「進出某處西南方，遮斷敵方退路」的命令，自許昌西南的閉子張出發，月色薄暗，黎明前的冷氣，沁入肺腑，我們浩浩蕩踏上河南平原的麥野，住着地圖，一往直前。慢慢地吃朝飯，正到達息足的某部落時，碰，碰，碰，機關槍圳始饗了。馬　繩還在手中，耳邊只聽見流彈呼呼作響。「快步走！」我們催馬加鞭，一掠而過，佔據附近的部落，向潛在少張莊部落洛的敵人進攻。</p>
<p>此處氈敵軍乃從南方裹城北上增援湯恩伯軍的第五十九團約千五百之眾，均係芷規軍。憑籍高三十尺，厚二十五尺的土壁，甩機關槍亂搽。日軍騎兵砲隊，即開始發揮威力。敵軍卒吿崩潰，遺屍千二百具，團長劉國昌以下二百七十八名被俘。</p>
<p>一戰之後，已經困倦萬狀，但我們又接連三日間不得腫眠。在陝縣附近搜索敵人不得，旋接得敗敵在洛陽南方龍門街集結的情報，就日夜兼程前進，直指龍門街，風勢猛烈，　沙漫天，難以睜目。馬也俯着首，跟蹌難行。四日午後十一時頃，到達臨汝鎮附近的某部落。當聽到一大休息！」的號令時，滿以為今夜可以酣睡一宵，沾沾自喜，可是隨即傳來一時起床，三時出發的命令，脫去雨具，修理馬匹，舉辦炊事，預備乾糧，一切準備妥貼，已近一時，不久即吿出發。</p>
<h3>渡河奇襲</h3>
<p>接着於五日鑿明前片刻，在龍門街角南方幽　高地，展開激戰。「今天攻取幽澗之敵，明日突破龍門街障地，後日攻略洛陽，然後痛快的睡覺。」聰了這樣的話，將士們意氣冲天。正午方過，汝河的渡河設營吿成，全軍一致敢然在敵前渡河，騎兵以得意的奇襲戰法，躍入敵懷。一千公尺關的河上，壑方山砲隆隆，重迫擊炮激起水烟，密如林立。但渡河終於成功，我部隊在敵陣高地的山麓，布置陣地，捨棄馬四，實行山麓肉搏，深入敵陣內部，敵方拼命州射。</p>
<p>我騎兵炮隊在河岸布置砲陣，將敵陣一一擊碎，三小時，四小時的砲戰，異常壯烈。在砲戰熾烈之際，伏在山麓的我突擊部隊身早一動不動。不久，夜色降臨，砲聲漸稀，敵方的機槍，發者煎豆一樣的爆烈聲。此際我有實行包圍之勢，敵見我無後援部隊，乃憑藉人眾，實行逆襲，殺聲震天，迎面的黑贈裹，漸漸展開了白刃戰。六日黎明，先前極度宣　的敵陣地，忽趨沉默，敵人斜巳遠颺，我們為搜紫更軍要的敵人，故捨棄此處之敵，而轉向新任務。是日午後沿某某街南下，並着馬首而南行的勇士們，談笑風生，興高采烈。</p>
<p>其時有敵機四架，在極度的低空中來襲，前進的人馬頭上，浴看十三公分口徑機關槍彈丸，射擊隊在間不容髮間，立刻應戰。記者伏在麥田裹，傍邊愛馬「義月，」悠然食着麥幹，呼，拍，拍，協歸砲彈飛過身畔，但「義月」對此莫不關心，眞所謂馬耳東風，騎兵的强由於馬，騎兵的弱，也由於馬。</p>
<p>是夜又夜行車，避開正路，翻山越嶺，馬蹄踏看山路的小石塊，得得之准，宛如發着小槍。越山，渡谿，繞着敵方的追路前進，」曾不致。</p>
<h3>悼惜愛馬</h3>
<p>五月某某日，這是記者畢生不忘的一日，是日午前四時自某處出發，在洛陽西南方的山嶽地帶迂迥行軍，　着天明的寒冷，又　着熾熱的塵埃，又加上不眠之夜，方在小河邊休息，愛馬「義月」忽呈異態，永也不渴地奄奄倒下。連日的强行軍，使它疲乏難支，一倒下去，就不能站起，獸醫官用盡種種方法，也無可如何。某某少佐，命乘馱馬代步，把「義月」背上的鞍，移到馱馬身上，於是就和它吿別。在戰綫一個月。與他出入搶林彈雨，片到不離。今此永訣，焉得不熟淚盈眶。</p>
<p>稍頃，承獸醫官的情，給「義月」注射了一針，就安然逝，洛陽未入身先死，質是可惜。不久以後記者到達洛陽城門，右手握了當日剪下「　月」的馬鬂一束，彷彿是騎着宅跨進了陷落的洛陽城。（譯自五月二十八日朝日新聞產原報遵班員通訊）黃梅天。</p>

<p>英美仗歐眾總司令官艾森　華澤手下的神經戰爭班，關於法北上陸作戰早就開始活動。據反軸心陣營傳出的消息，侵攻開始前三月，美聯通訊社的倫敦特派員即已傳出西歐上陸開始之說，美則方面因而慌忙加以掩飾。這就是神經戰爭班的第一箭。由於登陸前透　了消息，德重反而有了準備。</p>
<p>六月六日開始登陸時，反軸心方面即由無錢電臺將預先製成的艾森霍華演說辭錄音片廣播出來。大意略謂：</p>
<p>「不問男女老少，凡愛國者都有取得最後勝利的任務。對於受着國內外指導者指揮的法國民衆，余當吿以諸君應該運從調令行事。對於有組織的集團，余當吿以請大家等待我發出攻打德國的信號。」</p>
<p>這一行動　在希冀法國民衆發動內部的搗亂，但迄今　當艾森　華鐵彈的法國民衆，是否會做照其希　行動，是不成間　的。（譯自大月十一日每日勒關）</p>
<h3>英美上陸舟艇</h3>
<p>英美軍所用上鐘船艇如下：</p>
<p>里加上陸　（美）張　艇（英）　兩者俱　全長十米內外的高速摩托艇，可載士兵三十名。</p>
<p>軍輛知陸艇　一待士兵登陸後，即由此艇將防空用的高射機關槍，道路建築用的土工牽引車或輕戰車等起卸上岸。此艇吃水頗淺，可用於淤淺的海岸。艇的前部可向左右展開，以便車輛立刻可從艇上行駛。</p>
<p>戰車卸陸船　比車　卸陸艇更大，重約數百噸，可載重戰車數輛。前部裝置也和車輛卸陸艇一樣「　」（美國）水陸兩用的軍用車，外觀宛如戰車，可載士兵四十名，着陸後即在地上行駛。</p>
<p>「　」（美國）遭也是水陸兩用車，有六個橡皮輪，可裝載士兵從海上駛抵陸上。</p>
<p>法國北部風光諾曼第半島雖然凸出法國北部，卻是氣候溫暖土地肥沃的地方，到處有蘋果林：和綠色的牧場。蘋果樹簡直可稱為法國的「國樹」，世上再沒有比諾曼第人愛好蘋果的了。</p>
<p>現在英美軍上陸地點的一帶海岸，本是巴黎仕女們的避　勝地，過去非常熱鬧。速結此處和巴黎的許多從　交　的汽車這，兩旁種者蘋果樹，蜿蜒於田園間，仿佛是　者綠色邊長帶。從前在蘋果樹臨下行駛的是　　汽車，今日卻是德國機械化部隊的「毛蟲」</p>
<p>諾曼第駛稱牛酪王國，以出產亁酪沽名，向外國輸出很多。目前戰局的一個焦點據說是在克恩和伊奇尼中間。反軸心軍在這方面用了許多的戰車設立兩個橋頭　，據傳電方已擊毀其戰車三十五輛。伊奇尼是法國的牛油產地，　享盛名。（六月十日朝日新聞」</p>

<h3>過節</h3>
<p>— 袁騰</p>
<p>太陽陰陽怪氣地照着，呌人不大相信道會兒是下午三點　。</p>
<p>可是大馬路上依然熙熙攘地，電軍龍工阻不了那些　們，而况明天除了是星期日而外，還是一個了不起的節日，人行道上，店家的櫥窗外，　台上，都擠滿了手裹提着簍子的老爺們，太太們，以及穿起新衣服的先生少奶奶們。</p>
<p>在這些人　中，夾着程俊先生，　了色的博士帽嵌在長頭髮上，一件才洗過的自由布長衫，領子漿得挺硬的，弄得頭頸有些不適意。</p>
<p>有一陣風從外灘那逐吹綴州來，吹起了他底長衫，程俊先生不自禁地全身一冷。</p>
<p>這一個寒噤，就跟他昨天在四舅鑿家裹打的一個差不多。</p>
<p>四舅另對着這位又來一接着咂一下嘴唇，表嚕囌的遠則外甥，擺着一示毫無辦注。付陰沉沉的臉。我們的眾人翁打了一</p>
<p>一過節，……大家一個寒　。樣難過……眞是，……唉　「請四寗再…再…」一。程俊先生陪着笑臉：「實在為難，房錢，房錢，房東太太來催過五次了，…過節，還得送科長的禮，聽說要裁員加薪…不得不……」</p>
<p>四舅：吃力地從抽屜　拿出五疊鈔票：</p>
<p>「這裹是五百眞是，現在大家難過，我跟你一樣，這裹是五百，唉，…，聽說米又要到一萬大關了，…這裡是五百。」</p>
<p>明白了對方的意思：</p>
<p>「利息還是五分？」</p>
<p>「也好，也好，」四舅舅點一下頭：「唉，眞是。」○……○</p>
<p>冠生園門口呑進吐出各種人物。</p>
<p>程先生停下在櫥窗外面。</p>
<p>「豆沙綜子四十元。」</p>
<p>「粽子。」他想：「送吳科長證例不錯。」</p>
<p>手據在口袋裏，數着那幾疊不曉得巳經數過冬次的鈔票：</p>
<p>「一二三…一二…三…四…五…六…」</p>
<p>三百六十塊！他到了裏面。迎可　來了一陣棕子的香味，程光生不禁嚥了一口吐沫。</p>
<p>「送多少呢？」他想。</p>
<p>「鹹肉粽屬十五元……蓮蓉蛋黃五十五元…火腿蛋黃五十五元…」</p>
<p>十隻太多，四百五十元不够。……五隻，五五廿五，五四二十，差不多，不過有點寒酸氣。</p>
<p>他躊躇了一會，終於向店員揮揮手：「半打鹹肉的。」幸而只置半打，簍子裏軟飄飄地，黃梅天，可以少出點汗。</p>
<p>「吳科長會怎麽樣呢？」他想。</p>
<p>也許別人全忘了送，而他第一個送了去。</p>
<p>也許吳科長會點點頭，露出兩賴金牙齒。</p>
<p>「好極，我最喜歡吃鹹肉綜，同志，哈哈。…」於是就談起鹹肉綜子的味道來。……</p>
<p>味道？他有點迷惡了，他委實不曉得這鹹肉綜子有什麽味道？</p>
<p>或者就談到加薪。</p>
<p>「唔，你這兩年來是科裏最賣力的一個，程錄事！呃！我知道的，我會加薪，你放心，老程，……老程……」</p>
<p>「老程，老程！」不知怎麽一來吳科長的聲音變了那個老趙的大喉嚨。</p>
<p>前面十皺步遠，那位庶務換了一聲新西裝，提着一隻大火腿。</p>
<p>「買火腿？」程先生迎上去。</p>
<p>「送給科長大人的。…喂！聽說我們這科裁的最多，不得不防一步，你買的什麽，綜子？」</p>
<p>「唔，鹹肉綜子，我這會就打算送去呢。」</p>
<p>可是吳科長不在家。</p>
<p>「老爺證不定耍晚上回來，放在這兒好了。」</p>
<p>程俊先生向那個當差要了一個紙條，又要了筆硯，恭恭敬敬地寫了兩行字。</p>
<p>科長大人哂納　職程俊拜呈</p>
<p>鄭震地將那條子塞進簍子，並几親手將它搬到里面一張檯子上，這才放心地辭別出來。</p>
<p>明天星期。後天，星期一，吳科長準得呌茶房來請自已到科長室里去，當面道謝，並且……</p>
<p>準定會扣薪！</p>
<p>他就保留這股勁兒一直踏進自己的家里。</p>
<p>太太一見而就苦者肢吿訴他，房東太太可來過了，看樣子如果節前不把房錢算淸，很有　電棧的危險！</p>
<p>程俊先生忍忿地從袋里把所有的票子一把都撒在　子上：「都給她吧！」</p>
<p>太太看了看那些浸了不曉得多少手汗的票子，嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>「有加薪的希望呢？」地熱烈地向。</p>
<p>沒有回聲，丈夫木然地看着那些票子。</p>
<p>「明天要不要弄什麽菜呢？」太太看看床頭下小煤爐上空着的小鍋子。</p>
<p>「算了吧！」簡單的回答。</p>
<p>太太只好不饗了，他靜靜地在煤爐前的小橙子上坐了下來。</p>
<p>寂靜—難堪的寂靜。</p>
<p>一次一次過去的端午節的盛况，在這一對年靑的主人底中　間閃過了。…</p>
<p>打破寂靜的是一位不速之客。</p>
<p>「咦！你　老趙！」程先生感到意外地從床邊跳起來。</p>
<p>「程俊！我們…我們都裁掉了！…剛才我到吳科長那里去，碰見了，碰見了王宗，他在科長房間里看見了名單，我們…都…裁掉了，……」程俊忽然覺眼前一片黑，立刻昏沉沉地倒了下去。</p>

<h3>體育　滬市壘球聯賽開始　介紹勁旅中華熊貓隊</h3>
<p>— 深一姆</p>
<p>我國人近年來對各項球類運動，如足織球均振普便，尤其是足球在滬上鑽為盛行。且我華人勁旅東華隊榮　本屆全滬聯賽冠軍及中華隊獲國際鄭標，使我華人一吐積弱之氣。至於棒球Base　Bal壘球Soft　Ball運動，在我國仍未甚盛行，紙有滬粤等地對此項運動稍有比賽。記得六　全運會中之　滬棒球決賽時之熱烈緊張，至今猶憶於腦際。當時我國好手多為旅美及旅日之華僑；如高漢恩，余百惠，周龍　，黃兆態輩均為代表我國出席遠東運東會者。</p>
<h3>本屆壘球聯賽　業一開始舉行</h3>
<p>事變前，滬上亦有據球聯賽，每年夏天均在跑馬廳舉行。當時華人隊伍參加者幾無，只有均在跑馬廳舉行。當時華人高伍參加者幾無，只有約大隊參與角逐，但每屆錦標均為西人所得，故國人對斯項運動鮮有注意。事變後，全滬棒球聯賽停辦。去年由留滬詐僑音樂會（FMU）唐喬斯等主辦全滬甲組壘球聯賽於膠州公園，我華隊亦無參加。故該項聯賽，國人知之者甚少。本屆壘球聯賽仍由菲僑州辦，已於上星期日在膠州公園開始比賽，</p>
<h3>華人組熊貓隊　為聯賽中勁旅</h3>
<p>本屆聯賽值得注意者，乃我華人亦參加焉。參加者乃淸一色之織廣東人所組織之熊貓壘球隊（Pandas）該隊於上星期日初次出馬即大敗　太隊，成績為七比二。觀眾對該隊之球藝，大加贊許，認為該聯賽中將對西人勁旅一大威脅，且有染標之絕大希望。故今特為文介紹該隊之實力及陣容，使國人對該隊得以重望及擁護。將來該隊如獲冠軍，可使滬上為西人獨拿之壘球運動一異彩也。</p>
<h3>全隊人才濟濟　初戰勝猶太隊</h3>
<p>熊貓隊成立已有三年；平時由名敎練紫圳一訓緻下已三有寒署。該隊曾參加去年私人創辦之聯賽（Percy　Kok　所主辦者）向所無敵　縱厝錦標。今年决參加公開聯賽。在初次比賽中過猶太隊，在最初之五局中，猶太隊員無一上壘。鄭有繫球，非為壘所殺，即被外場之翼所接（Out　Field）故該織之守，緊密如壁，尤其是主壘及游繫（Short　Stop）之迅速接擲，捕手接球之萬無一失，為該隊致勝之主因。觀眾亦譽該誅之長乃在迅速及穩健。至於攻之方面該隊無論對長擊及　擊，各隊員均有其長，每使他隊難於防守。日該隊善繫低而峻急之球，故上壘機會極多，且偸壘本領亦所善長，使他隊每對之提心吊謄。該隊隊員共十一人，均為粤籍；隊長鍾保羅乃約大學生，身材高大，任右外翼（LejtField）與同隊之中外翼（Center　Field）　兆森及左外翼（Rigli　Field）勞狀森三人蹤守外圍，對失。一壘唐偉業乃粤縱南隊之名手，接球穩健，　溫天華，遊擊溫瑞雄，三壘球梁友聲，捕手黃應瑞等均為留日華僑，曾在日妝表中澤隊出戰，日會代表橫濱等巿參加全日聯　。故該四人之球　；無懈可擊，如有球擊至二壘及三壘間，必死無疑，因游擊及三壘均出手如矢。尤善Unuer　Hand之　球，對偸壘之封錯及接殺之州速為他隊所莫及。此外如中堅（Rover）乃壘球賽中之特有棒球賽中無此位置。此位置乃在二壘後及中外翼之間）王念祖亦為約大學生，對塡空（Cover）及　球之接擲均甚精練。又如另一捕手王秀山，乃粤將，與投手阿膝合作，對接球無一漏失，且善拙殺「偸二壘」之球，峻急而準確。故凡欲從一壘偷二壘時，　為此子所殺。且王君為捕手時每鬼計多端，詭計百出，每使他隊擊球時無從捉摸，故常有精彩之演出也。</p>
<p>綜觀上述各員之球藝，對錦標之染指確有厚望。隊領隊為滬上名律師鄂森博士，全隊均衣灰色制服，威風凜凜，預備本屆聯賽中痛繫西人，為我華人爭光也。</p>
<p>又聞該聯賽中，名隊不少，如西隊擁有　球好手黑人　克，及奧沙　等人。又如上　冠軍「路斯坦奴」紅隊，擁有胖子湯　拉（Tom　Burer）等人，實力雄厚。此外如，妝，　　及紅十字隊等均球　上乘。未可輕視。且略斯坦奴隊中胖子　拉之投手所投之球，其峻急為各隊所不及，且善擊「全壘」球（Home　Rnn）為該隊之靈魂也。</p>
<h3>本星期日上午　出戰上屆冠軍</h3>
<p>熊貓隊已排定本星期日（七月二日）上午九時起與上屆冠軍之「路斯坦奴」紅隊比賽，此兩對為聯賽中之最强者。兩雄相遇，必有一番甜鬥。勝利屬誰未可預卜。國人如嗜此項運動者，可往膠州公園參觀，不收門票，同時可為我罪隊棒塲也。望我熊貓隊員，好自為之，努力以赴，為我華人爭取勝</p>
<h3>足球季及將結束　華聯連戰四塲</h3>
<p>本屆足球季已隨流光消逝，炎夏來臨，當茲赤傘高張，　賺肆虐，球員久歷戎行，征　甫卸，此時正宜偃旗息鼓，暫資休憇。乃慈善義賽，接踵而來，迷兄迷姐於季節結束後，竟得多得幾塲額外表演，眼福誠是不漢。計最近有四塲比賽，已賽三塲，尙有今日逸園一塲，內三塲為慈善賽，一塲為友誼賽。三塲觀後，頗有所感，略抒我見。</p>
<h3>籌募火政善賽　華聯首告敗挫</h3>
<p>此戰由華聯首戰葡聯，後者調整陣容，邀前聖芳濟健將福恩潘脫氈昆仲助陣，而華聯則反見支配失當，以致攻守俱見遲滯。葡聯福恩又見活躍，竟然獨中四球，以五對四克服華聯。華聯門將劉顯漢慌張之至，救球乏術，亦失敗之主因。華聯幸有李堯韓龍海之努力，仍得獲中四球，已盡最大之努力矣。觀乎此戰，則我人可信足球賽，最重够氣與合作功夫，否則徒有上將，必成畫餅，難望好成績也</p>
<h3>一場友誼比賽　華聯再度失利</h3>
<p>華聯之對手為一警隊，此番華聯攻以聯誼為主，守以東華為本，調整自較良好。唯此日天氣酷熱，球迷乃少，球員精神亦欠振作。且以球遝不佳，上半時先以一對二居下風。一警賴體力充沛，復以該隊員休息已久，自見格外有力。而下牛時中開賽不久，大雨傾盆，鑿風又作，球員在雨淋中，雖依然奮發作戰，究屬表演遜色。彼此均在水戰中混過而已，各無所獲。華聯遂以一對二敗北，而上半時中華聯　中二球，惜均以越位作嚴。球迷無不同聲嘆息，而怨裁判不免有矯紙過正之感。實則黃仁彝之裁判，確為極賣力之一員也。</p>
<h3>華聯整刷陣容　乃克服日德</h3>
<p>聯第三戰於昨日比賽，由華聯第三戰迎鬥日德聯。前者　於兩敗之辱，乃整刷陣容，攻以東華為重，守補以聯誼中　綫之鄭英權與宋電　，大見生氣。日德聯頗多個中能手。各個技術，相常可取，似聯絡稍見。華聯演出、進攻至神出鬼沒，幾使對方莫知所措。幼良與龍位置之純熟妙不可喩。阿戴又見雉健，叩中二球，允稱最捉少見，眞不信年事己高之阿戴，竟再能有如美妙成績，誰謂其老弱無用，後起中實乏有此種人材。阿戴從橫球場十餘年，迄今尚能由此威風，足以自　矣。結果華聯以四對二取勝，且失去良機甚多及十二碼一球，否則勝球何止此耶？</p>
<h3>今日最後一塲　華聯再戰葡僑</h3>
<p>今日下午有天主教主辦義賽在逸園舉行，由華聯再戰葡聯。此戰將成為本季最後之役矣。而觀乎雙方陣容之整齊，亦可信為本季精彩之送別賽矣。緣葡隊作織，與華隊頗有相似之處，亦以細膩見長。是則我極希望華聯最應注意陣容之支配。應　於對方之人頭，而加以支配，則勝利當極有把握也。</p>
<h3>體壇花絮</h3>
<p>祝土芳紅極一時之排珠女將也。記者昨赴靑年會看各單，見綠隊及隆隊中，均有此將芳名，眾織這位排球聖手究將歸皺</p>
<p>紹興盃夏光齋兩籃球聯賽，相機舉行，使冷寂之籃球壇，又可盛一時。而陳中張覺非等，必將苦幹一番。</p>

        <h1>1944.06.30</h1>
<h3>Commentary: Answering a Guest's Questions</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin Su</p>
<p>From the Henan Campaign to the Capture of Hengyang</p>
<p>Question: The war in both Asia and Europe has entered a decisive phase, but what we should pay most attention to is the new situation on our Chinese mainland battlefield. From the Henan Campaign to the fall of Changsha and Hengyang, the entire war situation has changed. May I ask, what is the real significance of this operation?</p>
<p>Answer: The Chinese battlefield has always been the main battlefield determining the future of the Greater East Asia War. Every move and stillness is closely related to the overall war situation. It is inevitable that the Allied Japan will eliminate the threats to its own country, protect the gains it has made, destroy the enemy's strategies, and complete the aims of the Greater East Asia War, thereby ensuring and expanding its victorious position on the Chinese mainland. Therefore, the recent operations in Henan and Hunan play a decisive role in the overall war situation.</p>
<p>Question: Now that the Japanese army has won victories in the Henan Campaign and the battles of Changsha and Hengyang, what important achievements have been made strategically?</p>
<p>Answer: The most important achievement is the beginning of the destruction of the anti-Axis powers' strategy of launching a counter-offensive in both Asia and Europe. This not only prevents the enemy from attacking the Japanese mainland, but also provides great assistance to the European Axis powers. Enemy American Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz has always advocated using the Chinese mainland to attack the Japanese mainland. Now, the strategic initiative in China has been completely in the hands of the Japanese army. Due to the occupation of Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang, the main arteries of the Chinese battlefield from South China to North China are completely controlled by the Japanese army, and Nimitz's plan to use the Chinese mainland has been completely shattered. At the same time, the island-hopping operations carried out by enemy American Southwest Pacific Commander MacArthur, from New Guinea, Borneo, and the Philippines to South China, are also severely threatened from the side due to the dramatic changes in the situation on the Chinese battlefield. Therefore, from the perspective of the Greater East Asia War situation, the achievements of this campaign are tantamount to laying the foundation for the final victory in the future decisive battle.</p>
<p>Question: The impact on Chongqing must be significant, right?</p>
<p>Answer: Generally speaking, there are about four points: First, the people under the rule of Chongqing, and even all the Chinese people, no longer believe in Chiang Kai-shek's power. The previous claims of a counter-offensive by Chongqing were just empty boasts, and this provides a strong counter-evidence. Second, the so-called Anglo-American aid to Chongqing is completely a deceptive trick in words only, and the strategy of leaving Sino-Japanese peace has fundamentally lost the faith of the general public. Third, the forces in the Chongqing regime that oppose the protracted war and criticize Britain and the United States will inevitably rise in the future, and friction will increase. Fourth, the Anglo-American attempt to use the Chinese mainland to attack Japan has been shattered.</p>
<p>Secondly, from a military point of view, the Central Plains theater with Luoyang as its center has always been a great fortress guarding the rear of Chongqing, and it is also the first line for preparing for the so-called "counter-offensive." The guerrilla forces active in North China are also maintained and supplied by this area. Now that it has been taken by the Japanese army, not only is there more solid security in North China, but the Japanese army has also opened the door to advance into Tongguan and suppress the Northwest. The strategic significance of Changsha is even greater than that of Luoyang. After the Japanese army occupied it, the Chongqing forces in the provinces east of the Yuehan Railway have been completely isolated, and their military collapse can be expected in days. In particular, after Hengyang fell in quick succession, the Japanese army is now in a superior position to directly attack the southwestern provinces. At the same time, this also means that Chongqing is in an increasingly difficult position. Moreover, Hunan Province is the richest in mineral and grain resources. The occupation of Changsha and Hengyang controls the entire Hunan region, which is of great value in wartime economy. On the other hand, the Jinghan and Yuehan railways can be connected, and the railway main line of the entire Greater East Asia region can be completed from Tokyo, Korea, Manchuria, Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Vietnam, Thailand to Zhao Nan Island, the significance and value of which deserve special attention.</p>
<p>Question: So, is the political achievement of this operation also very great?</p>
<p>Answer: Let's not talk about the historical significance of large cities such as Luoyang, Changsha, and Hengyang. Just looking at their current status, Luoyang is the political center of the Central Plains. Whoever occupies that place has the possibility of controlling the entire Central Plains. As for Changsha, it is the center of the revolutionary movement in Central and Southern China, and during the war, it is also the political hub linking various regions in East and West China. As long as you open a map, you can see that the Japanese army has already controlled the Pinghan and Yuehan transportation lines, and Hengyang is also a major station on the Yuehan Railway and the starting point of the Xianggui Railway. Therefore, the provinces of Gan, Min, Gui, Yue, Chuan, and Qian are within the direct control of the Japanese army, and at the same time, the provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Wan, Gan, Min, and Yue are completely cut off from the southwest, which is the general base of "resistance." This has two major political meanings: From now on, Chongqing will become increasingly isolated and become a local regime in name only; the political forces in the peace zone can be expanded from now on. Therefore, the theory of Chinese unification is approaching the stage of realization.</p>
<p>Question: What are the future trends?</p>
<p>Answer: The victory of the Allied land, sea, and air forces in this operation has begun to break the enemy's strategy of counterattacking Japan, has strengthened the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War, and has also changed the entire political, military, and economic situation in China. However, military victories must continue to be expanded to prevent the enemy from using the Chinese mainland battlefield. At the same time, military victories must be guaranteed and expanded through political efforts. The so-called political efforts of course hope that the National Government will take advantage of this favorable situation to thoroughly reform politics, improve people's livelihoods, revive the war zone, promote construction, and improve the political faith of the people throughout the country in the peace zone. In particular, the people in the areas liberated by the Japanese army should quickly receive the grace of true benevolent governance, and gain a correct impression of the policy of resistance and peace and know how to choose. Only in this way will the ideal of Chinese unification be realized, and the so-called cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War will have a real effect. We must follow up the Japanese military victory with a new political victory.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Hengyang Airfield, Fierce Fighting Occurs in the Sky Above</h3>
<p>Hengyang City Surrounded on Three Sides by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 29th: The Japanese army, which is currently operating in the Hunan area, occupied the Hengyang Airfield, a forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on June 26.

<p>A certain base of the Japanese army on the Hunan front, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army attacking Hengyang along the Yuehan Line made a three-sided breakthrough into the Hengyang Airfield on the east bank of the Xiang River before dawn on the 26th, completely occupying the town. Thus, one of the powerful bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. Furthermore, the Japanese army advancing south from the west bank of the Xiang River has completely surrounded Hengyang City, which is opposite the Hengyang Airfield, on the north, southwest, and three sides. Therefore, the main forces of the Chongqing 10th and 96th Divisions, which are surrounded, continue to resist relying on air fortress cover, but have already entered a heavy encirclement, and the Japanese army is now launching an annihilation battle.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Side Announces War Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - A Chongqing correspondent for the Associated Press stated on the 28th that the Chongqing military authorities announced the war situation on the night of the 28th, stating that the battle for Hengyang is currently progressing around the entire city. This is enough to imply that the Japanese army is besieging Hengyang. The loss of Hengyang is the biggest blow to Chongqing since the fall of Guangzhou and Hankou in October 1938. Due to the loss of Hengyang, the roads to attack Shaoguan, an important base of the Chongqing army, and Guilin, where the Chongqing-Guangxi provincial government is located, have been opened.</p>

<h3>Chongqing-US Air Force Base Retreats</h3>
<p>A certain base of the Japanese army, 29th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing intended to use Hengyang to attack the Japanese mainland and disrupt the peaceful areas. After the Japanese army occupied Changsha, they took advantage of the victory to advance south. At the same time, the Japanese air force units in China also exerted their power, and the Hengyang Airfield was finally captured by the Japanese army. With the Japanese army occupying the Hengyang Airfield, the situation has changed. Jianyang, Lishui, and Suichuan, which are east of the Yuehan Line, have become the most advanced bases for Japanese aircraft. At the same time, a favorable situation has also been adopted against Guilin. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has fled from Hengyang to Lingling. Most of the US aircraft are launched from Guilin, with hundreds of aircraft every day. Since they have coveted the Japanese ground troops, they disturb the rear at night. With their backs to the water in Lingling and Guilin, their counter-attack force is like the end of a crossbow.</p>

<h3>Plans for Temporary Reconciliation with the Communist Party</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Under high pressure from Britain and the United States, the Chongqing regime is attempting to achieve a temporary reconciliation with the Communist Party.

<h3>Various Provinces Actively Complete High-Level Clearing of the Countryside</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News - After the National Government returned to the capital, in order to establish security, improve people's livelihoods, and establish a model of local peace, in order to gradually move towards a comprehensive peace. At the same time, in order to stabilize the villages and eliminate the bandits and communists, it was also necessary to start clearing the countryside. The actual clearing work started in July of the 30th year and has now reached its third year. At the beginning of the clearing of the countryside, the target was the four counties of Wu, Kun, Tai, and Chu in Jiangsu Province. In September of that year, the counties of Wuxi and Jiangyin successively began. In March of the 31st year, the clearing of the countryside began in Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhong, and Wujin counties. In July, the clearing of the countryside began in seven counties in the southeast of Taihu Lake.

In April of the 32nd year, the clearing of the countryside began in the four counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, and Qi in northern Jiangsu. In October, the clearing of the countryside began in the Hangzhou area. Thus, the clearing work started in Su, Kun, Tai, and Chu in Jiangsu and gradually spread to important areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. In February of the 33rd year, the heads of provinces and cities held a conference on liaison in clearing the countryside, deciding to shorten the one-and-a-half-year period of clearing the countryside to one year. The stages of the clearing work were based on a 363 system, that is, three months of preparation work, six months of full-scale work, and three months of supplementary work. After the meeting, the clearing work in Anhui Province began to prepare, and it was launched on June 1.

At this time, when the five provinces of Su, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Guangdong have successively implemented the clearing of the countryside, it coincides with the third anniversary of the clearing of the countryside, and its significance is indeed significant. After three years of efforts in clearing the countryside, not only has the scope expanded, but also in terms of content, all items such as autonomous organizations, production capacity, and economic systems have gradually been put on track, so that people's livelihoods are stable and security is established.

<h3>European War Approaching Decisive Stage, Fierce Battle for Caen</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Central News Agency) - Since the German retreat from Rome, followed by the Allied landings in Western Europe and the start of the Soviet summer offensive, the German army has invited the enemy's large forces to attack on three fronts, and the war seems to have entered a decisive stage. According to German authorities' observation, the current Soviet forces in the central part of the Eastern Front are estimated to have at least 85 divisions and one tank army, with approximately 700,000 soldiers and approximately 1,500 tanks. The German army will continue to engage in bloody battles on both the Eastern and Western fronts. The Siege of Sevastopol is the best example, but this is only the prelude to the Allied large-scale offensive operation. The US and British armies are expected to carry out new landing operations in Western Europe in the state of Xu. It is expected that the Soviet army will also start a new offensive on the Front Line, which will be the final stage for the German army to exert all its strength and display its heroic spirit.</p>

<h3>Anglo-American Forces in Italy Heavily Reinforced</h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency) - The fighting west of Lake Trasimeno in Italy is intensifying. Although the British and Americans are heavily reinforcing with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, the German defenses remain unbroken. Haiye: Units such as motor vehicle troops must travel along major roads. If the roads are damaged and impassable, they have no choice but to travel through farmland. Originally, driving into farmland during wartime was not a problem. However, this time, the Japanese army must first obtain the consent of the village chief. On one occasion, an officer went with an interpreter to find the village chief, but was unable to locate him. It took two hours to finally find him. The army wasted two hours during its advance, which had a significant impact on the operation plan. However, the Japanese army disregarded this disadvantage and respected the opinions of the Chinese people. This is a special feature of this operation. Previously, when a major famine occurred in Henan, the Chongqing army stationed in Henan still levied harsh taxes on ordinary farmers, collecting one jiao (tenth of a yuan) of tax money and eight jin (four kilograms) of rice per person. Later, this was increased to sixteen jin (eight kilograms) of rice. This time, when the Japanese army entered Henan, the commander of the North China Army issued a proclamation stating that all taxes in Henan would be waived. The people were greatly moved by this proclamation. There are various heartwarming stories about construction. The Japanese army hired Chinese laborers and paid them wages. Their daily income was several times higher than that of Japanese soldiers, which often made the Japanese soldiers envious. A railway construction unit in northern Henan employed six Chinese children to do small tasks such as carrying bricks. In addition to a daily wage of five yuan in vouchers, they were also provided with meals. The Japanese soldiers were very kind to these children. When the unit completed the project and began to move south, the temporary laborers refused to leave. They begged the unit to take them along and their parents pleaded with the unit commander in every possible way. As a result, the unit commander agreed. On the day the unit departed, the children's families came to see them off. The section of railway from Zhengzhou to Yancheng has been mostly completed, and the remaining work is proceeding smoothly. It is expected to be open to traffic next month.</p>

<h3>Rice Control Commission Announces Methods for Transporting Rice to Shanghai, Twelve Temporary Permit Issuing Offices to Be Established Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Since being ordered to ease restrictions on the movement of rice, the Rice Control Commission has, in conjunction with the Shanghai Special City Government, formulated temporary measures for the management of rice for Shanghai citizens. The regulations and announcements have been made regarding the application for and issuance of permits for transporting rice into Shanghai, as well as the types of permits and how they are to be used. In view of the panic over food in Shanghai and in accordance with Article 6 of the Outline of Temporary Measures for Rice in Beijing and Shanghai, the Commission has designated twelve temporary permit issuing offices in the city for entry. Before the establishment of these offices, the Commission will issue temporary permits and receipts, and no rice will be requisitioned.</p>
<h3>Requisitioning Begins</h3>
<p>It is understood that the number of applications from farmers, merchants, and residents in various places for permits to transport rice to Shanghai has been increasing daily. It was learned yesterday that the Commission, in order to facilitate applications from farmers, merchants, and residents, has decided to establish the temporary permit issuing offices on July 1st to begin processing the issuance of permits and receipts, requisitioning rice, counting quantities, and inspecting rice quality. When transporting rice, except for those transported by train to Shanghai, all others are limited to transporting rice into the city between 6:00 AM and 8:00 PM daily. Any rice transported in after hours will be considered smuggled. Therefore, any rice transported to Shanghai with temporary import permits issued before July 1st will not be requisitioned, but must be verified by the permit issuing office for quantity and stamped before being allowed entry. For rice transported from other districts to Shanghai with permits issued on or after July 1st, the temporary permit issuing office of the Commission will requisition rice according to the requisitioning scope. Rice under five dou (approximately 50 kilograms) will be exempt from requisitioning, while rice over five dou will be requisitioned according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Various Procedures</h3>
<p>The various procedures that citizens must follow when applying for a temporary import permit or license are disclosed below: Applicants should first come to the office to obtain a "receipt" and fill it out themselves. Applicants should maintain order and line up to receive it, without pushing or shoving. Applicants should present their citizen ID card along with the "receipt" for verification and issuance. Omitted. Each permit should be stamped with a one yuan stamp tax. The validity period of this permit is two days. It will be invalid after the expiration date. If seven days are needed, application can be made to the general office. When citizens transport rice to the port of entry, personnel from this office must verify the quantity of rice transported, weigh it, and requisition 30% of it according to regulations (i.e., three dou per shi (approximately 100 kilograms) for rice between five dou and ten shi). Payment will be made at the prescribed price. Rice under five dou will not be requisitioned. Citizens must obtain a license for rice under five dou and a temporary import permit for rice between five dou and ten shi before it can be transported into the urban area. Citizens can inquire at the issuing office if they have questions about the application procedures for permits. The temporary permits issued by the issuing office are free of charge, except for the one yuan stamp tax per permit. The amount of self-supplied food transported by citizens should be calculated according to the proportion of the population and should not exceed three months to limit hoarding. If the amount of rice transported by citizens exceeds the three-month consumption of the population of their household, they should indicate the amount exceeding the limit and sell it to rice shops registered with the municipal government. Otherwise, if discovered, it will be considered hoarding. These measures will be implemented from July 1, 1944.</p>

<h3>Distributors Are Illegally Exploiting Customers; File Accurate Complaints, Chairman Tang Said in a Speech</h3>
<p>The temporary allocation of cotton cloth to citizens in the city, which was announced by the Municipal Government and the National Commercial Control Association on June 1st, has been underway for a month. During this period, it has been reported that some retail merchants handling the allocation of cotton cloth are not complying with the prescribed procedures and are exploiting the interests of citizens. A reporter from this newspaper yesterday visited Mr. Tang Shoumin, former director and current supervisor of the Commercial Control Association, to inquire about his opinion. He gave the following statement: "This time, the Commercial Control Association, together with the Municipal Government, submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan for approval to hold the temporary allocation of cotton cloth to citizens in the city. Each citizen can purchase 1.5 zhang (approximately 3.5 meters) of cotton cloth. The types and prices of the cotton cloth have been prescribed and announced. Detailed measures have been newly formulated for the cloth merchants handling the allocation, with the overall interests of the citizens as the main purpose. All cloth merchants should comply with these measures. As for some unscrupulous cloth merchants who do not comply with the prescribed measures, deceive citizens, and seek illegal profits, I have also heard about this, which is very hateful. I hope that citizens who encounter deception by cloth merchants will immediately file accurate complaints. This association will certainly investigate and deal with them according to law, in order to deter others from doing the same and protect the interests of citizens."</p>
<p>The reporter noted that Mr. Tang's expression and attitude were very serious. Citizens, for the sake of their own rights and interests, should file accurate complaints if they are subjected to illegal exploitation. Do not give up your rights, and effectively assist the authorities in correcting abuses.

<h3>Tang, Former Director of the Commercial Control Association, Supports This Newspaper's Student Aid</h3>
<p>Donates 500,000 Yuan to Benefit Needy Students</p>
<p>Since the launch of this newspaper's seventh student aid fund, applications have been very enthusiastic. The goal is to raise 10 million yuan for this fund. However, the current amount in hand, including the proceeds from the charity soccer match (as the honor vouchers have not been fully collected and announced), is approximately 5 million yuan, only half of the target. The date for disbursement is approaching, and the colleagues are deeply anxious. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to contribute. Yesterday, Mr. Tang Shoumin, former director of the National Commercial Control Association, donated 500,000 yuan to this newspaper's student aid fund, benefiting needy students. His contribution is truly significant.</p>

Ms. Li will be performing a charity concert for this newspaper's student aid fund. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be donated to the student aid fund. Her enthusiasm is truly admirable. The support and assistance of China Film and Manchuria Film are also commendable. It is hoped that movie fans who love to listen to Ms. Li's singing will also not forget the purpose of "helping students for the greatest good" and will enthusiastically participate early. Tickets are already on sale at the Lánxīn Theater. Please purchase them early. Although the weather may be oppressively hot, it is worth braving the heat to attend the concert for the sake of student aid or to help students by listening to the concert. We welcome you all.</p>

<h3>A Frontline Account from Henan</h3>
<p>To Luoyang, to Luoyang, soldiers and horses awake all night, advancing step by step. For a continuous month and a half, marching at night, taking short rests, marching and marching at night again, fighting, advancing, taking short rests, so there was not a single time when we camped at sunset. Taking three or four hour short rests, we had to feed the horses, cook, and sleep, and prepare for the next day's battle in a short period of time. Fortunately, both the soldiers and their families were resilient and good at fighting and advancing. For four whole days, we had less than ninety hours of sleep, advancing to search for the enemy. Finally, on May 25th, we encountered a strong enemy force and engaged in fierce fighting. The Iron Cavalry unit of some name and the force group, which conquered Luoyang with great power, had been on a non-stop march for a full month and a half. This reporter followed the Iron Cavalry unit for 1,000 kilometers, experiencing the various situations of combat firsthand. The following is a brief account:</p>
<h3>Embarking on the Journey</h3>
<p>At 2:00 AM on May 2nd, we received the order to "advance to the southwest of a certain place to block the enemy's retreat," and set off from Bizi Zhang, southwest of Xuchang. The moonlight was dim, and the cold air before dawn penetrated into our lungs. We marched mightily across the wheat fields of the Henan Plain, relying on maps, going straight ahead. While slowly eating breakfast, just as we reached a village to rest, "Bang, bang, bang," the machine gun began to roar. The horse reins were still in our hands, and we only heard bullets whizzing past our ears. "Move quickly!" We urged our horses to gallop past and occupied a nearby village to attack the enemy entrenched in the Xiaozhangzhuang village.</p>
<p>The enemy forces here were the 59th Regiment, about 1,500 strong, from the south, who were heading north to reinforce Tang Enbo's army. They were all regular troops. Relying on a thirty-foot-high and twenty-five-foot-thick earthen wall, they fired wildly with machine guns. The Japanese cavalry artillery unit immediately began to exert its power. The enemy army was finally defeated, leaving 1,200 corpses, and 278 people, including the regimental commander Liu Guochang, were captured.</p>
<p>After the battle, we were already exhausted, but we were unable to sleep for three consecutive days. We searched for the enemy near Shan County without success. Then, we received intelligence that the defeated enemy was gathering in Longmen Street, south of Luoyang, so we advanced day and night, heading straight for Longmen Street. The wind was strong, and sand filled the sky, making it difficult to open our eyes. The horses also lowered their heads and staggered with difficulty. At about 11:00 PM on the fourth day, we reached a village near Linru Town. When we heard the command "Take a long rest!" we were overjoyed, thinking that we could sleep soundly tonight. But immediately, the order came to get up at 1:00 AM and set off at 3:00 AM. We removed our rain gear, repaired our horses, cooked, and prepared dry food. All preparations were completed by nearly 1:00 AM, and we soon departed.</p>
<h3>River Crossing Surprise Attack</h3>
<p>Then, just before dawn on the fifth day, fierce fighting broke out on the southern high ground of the Dragon Gate Street corner. "Today we capture the enemy in the secluded valley, tomorrow we break through the barricades of Dragon Gate Street, the day after tomorrow we conquer Luoyang, and then sleep soundly!" Hearing these words, the soldiers' spirits soared. Shortly after noon, the river crossing camp on the Ru River was completed, and the entire army bravely crossed the river in front of the enemy. The cavalry, using their favored surprise attack tactics, leaped into the enemy's embrace. On the river, a thousand meters wide, the mountain guns roared, and heavy mortars stirred up plumes of water, as dense as a forest. But the river crossing was finally successful. Our troops set up positions at the foot of the high ground in the enemy's lines, abandoning their horses and engaging in hand-to-hand combat at the foot of the mountain, penetrating deep into the enemy's interior. The enemy desperately fired their weapons.</p>
<p>Our cavalry artillery units set up gun emplacements on the riverbank, shattering the enemy's positions one by one. The artillery battle, lasting three to four hours, was exceptionally fierce. During the intense shelling, our assault troops lying in wait at the foot of the mountain remained motionless. Soon, night fell, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, and the enemy's machine guns emitted a crackling sound like frying beans. At this point, we had a tendency to encircle them. Seeing that we had no support troops, the enemy, relying on their numbers, launched a counterattack, with battle cries shaking the sky. In the face of the enveloping darkness, a fierce bayonet fight gradually unfolded. At dawn on the sixth day, the enemy's previously extremely noisy positions suddenly fell silent. The enemy had fled far away. In order to search for more militarily important enemies, we abandoned the enemy here and turned to a new mission. That afternoon, along a certain street southward, the brave warriors, leading their horses southward, chatted and laughed, full of excitement.</p>
<p>At that time, four enemy planes attacked from extremely low altitude. Bullets from thirteen-centimeter caliber machine guns rained down on the heads of the advancing troops. The firing squad immediately returned fire in the nick of time. The reporter lay in the wheat field. Beside him, his beloved horse, "Yiyue," leisurely ate wheat stalks. Bang, bang, bang, shells flew past him, but "Yiyue" paid no attention to them, truly indifferent to the noise. The strength of the cavalry depends on the horse, and the weakness of the cavalry also depends on the horse.</p>
<p>That night, there was another night march, avoiding the main roads, traversing mountains and ridges. The horse hooves stepped on the small stones of the mountain path, the sound as clear as small gunshots. Crossing mountains, fording streams, moving forward, bypassing the enemy's pursuit route, we were never caught.</p>
<h3>Bereaved Over Beloved Horse</h3>
<p>Sometime in May, this is a day that the reporter will never forget. On that day, we set off from a certain place at four o'clock in the morning, maneuvering through the mountainous area southwest of Luoyang, enduring the cold of dawn, the scorching dust, and sleepless nights. Just as we were resting by a small river, my beloved horse, "Yiyue," suddenly showed signs of distress, collapsing lifelessly, never to thirst again. The continuous forced marches had exhausted it. Once it fell, it could not stand up. The veterinarian tried all sorts of methods, but to no avail. A certain Major ordered to ride a packhorse instead. The saddle on "Yiyue's" back was transferred to the packhorse, and then we said goodbye to it. On the front line for a month, we went in and out of the hail of bullets together, inseparable. Now, this final farewell, how could I not be filled with tears?</p>
<p>After a while, at the veterinarian's request, he gave "Yiyue" an injection, and it passed away peacefully. Dying before entering Luoyang, it was truly a pity. Soon after, the reporter arrived at the gates of Luoyang, holding a lock of "Yiyue's" mane, cut off that day, in his right hand, as if he were riding it across to enter the fallen city of Luoyang. (Translated from the May 28th Asahi Shimbun, produced by the original newspaper reporter.) Plum rain season.</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Western European Battlefield</h3>
<p>Nerve Warfare and Economic Warfare</p>
<p>The nerve warfare team under General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the Anglo-American forces in Europe, had already begun operations concerning the landing operation in Northern France. According to news from the anti-Axis camp, three months before the invasion began, the London correspondent of the Associated Press had already reported the start of the landing in Western Europe, causing the American side to hurriedly cover it up. This was the first arrow of the nerve warfare team. Because the news was leaked before the landing, the Germans were prepared instead.</p>
<p>When the landing began on June 6, the anti-Axis side broadcast a pre-recorded speech by Eisenhower through a clandestine radio station. The general idea was:</p>
<p>"Regardless of men, women, old or young, all patriots have the task of achieving final victory. To the French people who are commanded by domestic and foreign leaders, I must tell you that you should act in accordance with orders. To organized groups, I must tell you to wait for me to issue the signal to attack Germany."</p>
<p>This action hoped to incite internal sabotage by the French people, but so far, it is questionable whether the French people, who are suffering under Eisenhower's iron fist, will act according to his wishes. (Translated from the July 11th issue of the Daily News.)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Landing Craft</h3>
<p>The landing craft used by the Anglo-American forces are as follows:</p>
<p>Landing Craft, Infantry (LCI) (American) / Assault Craft (British) Both are high-speed motorboats about ten meters in length, capable of carrying thirty soldiers.</p>
<p>Landing Craft, Vehicle (LCV) After the soldiers have landed, this craft is used to unload anti-aircraft machine guns for air defense, earthmoving tractors for road construction, or light tanks ashore. This craft has a shallow draft and can be used on shallow coasts. The front of the craft can be opened to the left and right, so that vehicles can immediately drive off the craft.</p>
<p>Landing Ship, Tank (LST) Larger than the Landing Craft, Vehicle, weighing several hundred tons, capable of carrying several heavy tanks. The front is equipped the same as the Landing Craft, Vehicle. "" (American) Amphibious military vehicle, resembling a tank in appearance, capable of carrying forty soldiers, driving on land after landing.</p>
<p>"" (American) Also an amphibious vehicle, with six rubber wheels, capable of carrying soldiers from the sea to land.</p>
<p>The Scenery of Northern France: The Normandy Peninsula, although protruding from northern France, is a region of warm climate and fertile land, with apple orchards and green pastures everywhere. The apple tree can almost be called the "national tree" of France, and there is no one in the world who loves apples more than the Normans.</p>
<p>The coastal area where the Anglo-American forces are now landing was once a resort destination for the ladies of Paris and was very lively in the past. The winding road connecting this place with Paris, lined with apple trees, meanders through the countryside like a green ribbon. In the past, it was luxurious cars that drove under the apple trees, but today it is the "caterpillars" of the German mechanized units.</p>
<p>Normandy is known as the "Kingdom of Butter," famous for its cheese production and exporting a great deal to foreign countries. It is said that the current focus of the battle is between Caen and Isigny. The anti-Axis forces have used many tanks to establish two bridgeheads in this area, and it is reported that the enemy has destroyed thirty-five tanks. Isigny is a famous butter-producing area in France. (June 10th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Celebrating the Holiday</h3>
<p>— Yuan Teng</p>
<p>The sun shines in a strange, yin-yang manner, making it hard to believe it's three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>But the main streets are still bustling with activity. The tramcars can't stop the people, especially since tomorrow is not only Sunday but also a remarkable holiday. The sidewalks, the shop windows, and the counters are all crowded with old men and women carrying baskets, as well as gentlemen and young ladies dressed in new clothes.</p>
<p>Among these people is Mr. Cheng Jun, his faded doctoral cap perched on his long hair, a newly washed cotton gown starched stiffly at the collar, making his neck somewhat uncomfortable.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blows from the Bund, raising the hem of his gown. Mr. Cheng Jun involuntarily shivers.</p>
<p>This shiver is almost identical to the one he felt yesterday at his fourth uncle's house.</p>
<p>His fourth uncle, facing this exasperatingly long-winded nephew again, spread his hands, indicating utter helplessness. His face was sullen. Our protagonist shivered again.</p>
<p>"Celebrating the holiday... everyone is as miserable as I am... truly... alas..." Mr. Cheng Jun forced a smile: "It's really difficult. The rent, the rent, the landlady has been urging me five times... It's the holiday, and I have to give a gift to the section chief. I heard there will be layoffs and raises... I have no choice..."</p>
<p>His fourth uncle laboriously pulled out five stacks of banknotes from his drawer:</p>
<p>"Here are five hundred. Truly, everyone is having a hard time now. I'm just like you. Here are five hundred. Alas... I heard rice is about to reach the ten thousand mark... Here are five hundred."</p>
<p>Understanding the other party's meaning:</p>
<p>"The interest is still five percent?"</p>
<p>"That's fine, that's fine," his fourth uncle nodded: "Alas, truly." ○……○</p>
<p>The entrance of Guanshengyuan (a famous Shanghai confectionery store) swallows and spits out various characters.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng stops in front of the window.</p>
<p>"Red Bean Zongzi: 40 yuan."</p>
<p>"Zongzi." He thinks: "Giving Wu section chief zongzi isn't a bad idea."</p>
<p>His hand in his pocket, counting the stacks of banknotes that he's counted countless times:</p>
<p>"One, two, three... one, two... three, four, five, six..."</p>
<p>Three hundred and sixty yuan! He enters the store. A gust of the aroma of zongzi greets him, and Cheng Guangsheng can't help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>"How many should I give?" he wonders.</p>
<p>"Salty Meat Zongzi: 45 yuan... Lotus Seed Paste with Egg Yolk: 55 yuan... Ham with Egg Yolk: 55 yuan..."</p>
<p>Ten is too many, 450 yuan isn't enough... Five? Five times five is twenty-five, five times four is twenty, that's close, but it feels a little stingy.</p>
<p>He hesitates for a moment, finally waving at the clerk: "Half a dozen salty meat ones." Fortunately, it's only half a dozen. The basket feels light and airy, and in this plum rain season, he'll sweat less.</p>
<p>"What will Section Chief Wu think?" he wonders.</p>
<p>Maybe everyone else will forget to give a gift, and he'll be the first.</p>
<p>Maybe Section Chief Wu will nod, revealing his two gold teeth.</p>
<p>"Excellent, I love eating salty meat zongzi, comrade, haha... " And then they'll talk about the taste of salty meat zongzi...</p>
<p>Taste? He's a little confused. He really doesn't know what the taste of salty meat zongzi is.</p>
<p>Or maybe they'll talk about raises.</p>
<p>"Well, you've been the most hardworking in the section for the past two years, Clerk Cheng! Uh! I know, I'll give you a raise, don't worry, Lao Cheng... Lao Cheng..."</p>
<p>"Lao Cheng, Lao Cheng!" Somehow, Section Chief Wu's voice changes into Lao Zhao's loud voice.</p>
<p>Ten steps ahead, the office clerk in his new suit, carrying a large ham.</p>
<p>"Buying ham?" Mr. Cheng greets him.</p>
<p>"For the section chief. ...Hey! I heard our section is the one with the most layoffs, so I have to take precautions. What did you buy, zongzi?"</p>
<p>"Uh, salty meat zongzi. I'm planning to deliver it right now."</p>
<p>But Section Chief Wu isn't home.</p>
<p>"The master probably won't be back until tonight. You can leave it here."</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Jun asks the servant for a slip of paper, and then asks for a writing brush. He respectfully writes two lines of words.</p>
<p>"Presented with Respect to Section Chief Wu, by Cheng Jun, his subordinate."</p>
<p>He carefully places the slip of paper in the basket, and then personally moves it to a table inside before bidding farewell, finally relieved.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Sunday. The day after tomorrow, Monday, Section Chief Wu will surely ask the tea boy to invite him to the section chief's office to express his gratitude in person, and also...</p>
<p>He's sure to get a raise!</p>
<p>He maintains this energy all the way back home.</p>
<p>His wife, upon seeing him, tells him with a bitter face that the landlady has been here. It seems that if they don't pay the rent before the holiday, there's a great risk of being evicted!</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng Jun angrily throws all the banknotes from his pocket onto the bed: "Give it all to her!"</p>
<p>His wife looks at the banknotes, soaked with countless sweaty hands, and sighs.</p>
<p>"Is there any hope for a raise?" she asks eagerly.</p>
<p>There's no reply. Her husband stares blankly at the banknotes.</p>
<p>"Should we make any special dishes tomorrow?" his wife asks, looking at the empty small pot on the small coal stove by the bed.</p>
<p>"Forget it!" is the simple reply.</p>
<p>His wife has no choice but to remain silent. She quietly sits down on the small stool in front of the coal stove.</p>
<p>Silence—an unbearable silence.</p>
<p>Memories of the grand scenes of past Dragon Boat Festivals flash through the minds of this young couple...</p>
<p>Breaking the silence is an unexpected guest.</p>
<p>"Eh! It's you, Lao Zhao!" Mr. Cheng says, jumping up from the bed in surprise.</p>
<p>"Cheng Jun! We... we've all been laid off! ...I just went to Section Chief Wu's place and ran into Wang Zong. He saw the list in the section chief's office. We... are all... laid off..." Cheng Jun suddenly feels a darkness before his eyes and immediately faints.</p>

<h3>Sports: Shanghai Softball League Begins: Introduction to the Strong Chinese Panda Team</h3>
<p>— Shen Yimu</p>
<p>In recent years, the Chinese people have become increasingly enthusiastic about various ball sports, such as football and volleyball. Football, in particular, is very popular in Shanghai. Furthermore, the strong Chinese team Donghua won the championship in this year's Shanghai League, and the Chinese team won an international trophy, allowing the Chinese to finally exhale after years of weakness. As for baseball and softball, they are still not very popular in China. Only in Shanghai, Guangdong, and other places is there some competition in these sports. I still remember the excitement and tension of the Shanghai baseball final during the Sixth National Games. At that time, many of the best players in China were overseas Chinese from America and Japan, such as Gao Hanen, Yu Baihui, Zhou Longgan, and Huang Zhaotai, who represented China in the Far Eastern Games.</p>
<h3>This Year's Softball League Has Already Begun</h3>
<p>Before the incident, there was also a Shanghai softball league, held every summer at the racecourse. At that time, there were almost no Chinese teams participating; only the Yale team competed. However, the championship was always won by foreigners, so the Chinese people paid little attention to this sport. After the incident, the Shanghai Baseball League was suspended. Last year, the Shanghai First Division Softball League was organized by Tang Qiaosi and others from the Shanghai Foreign Overseas Chinese Music Association (FMU) at Jiaozhou Park, but no Chinese teams participated. Therefore, very few Chinese people knew about this league. This year's softball league is still organized by Filipino overseas Chinese and began last Sunday at Jiaozhou Park.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Panda Team Is a Strong Team in the League</h3>
<p>What is noteworthy about this year's league is that the Chinese are also participating. The participants are the Panda softball team, organized entirely by Cantonese people. In their first appearance last Sunday, they defeated the Jewish team by a score of seven to two. The audience praised the team's skills and believed that they would be a major threat to the strong Western teams in the league and had a great chance of winning the championship. Therefore, I am writing this article to introduce the team's strength and lineup so that the Chinese people can look forward to and support them. If the team wins the championship in the future, it will add a new color to the softball sport, which has been dominated by Westerners in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Team Is Full of Talent and Defeated the Jewish Team in Their First Game</h3>
<p>The Panda team was established three years ago and has been trained by coach Zi Zhenyi for several years. The team participated in the privately organized league last year (organized by Percy Kok) and was undefeated, winning the championship. This year, they decided to participate in the open league. In their first game, they defeated the Jewish team. In the first five innings, none of the Jewish players reached base. If they hit the ball, they were either killed on the base or caught by the outfielders. Therefore, the team's defense is as tight as a wall, especially the quick catches and throws of the shortstop, and the catcher's flawless catches are the main reason for the team's victory. The audience also praised the team's strength in its speed and stability. As for offense, the team's players have their strengths in both long hits and bunts, making it difficult for other teams to defend. The team is good at hitting low and sharp balls, so they have many opportunities to reach base, and they are also good at stealing bases, making other teams wary of them. The team has a total of eleven players, all of whom are Cantonese. Captain Zhong Baoluo is a Yale student, tall, and plays right field. Zhong Zhaosen, who plays center field, and Lao Zhuangsen, who plays left field, jointly defend the outfield, preventing misses. First baseman Tang Weiye is a famous player from the Guangdong Nan team, catching the ball steadily. Wen Tianhua, shortstop Wen Ruixiong, third baseman Liang Yousheng, and catcher Huang Yingrui are all overseas Chinese students who studied in Japan. They played for the Japanese Zezhong team in Japan and represented Yokohama and other cities in the All-Japan League. Therefore, the skills of these four are impeccable. If the ball is hit between second and third base, it is sure to be killed because the shortstop and third baseman release the ball like arrows. They are especially good at underhand throws, and their speed in blocking steals and making catches is unmatched by other teams. In addition, Rover Wang Nianzu (the rover position is unique to softball and does not exist in baseball. This position is located between second base and center field) is also a Yale student and is very skilled in covering and catching balls. Another catcher, Wang Xiushan, is a Cantonese general. He cooperates with pitcher A Xi to prevent any missed catches and is good at killing "steals to second base" with sharp and accurate throws. Therefore, anyone who tries to steal second base from first base is often killed by this player. Furthermore, Wang is full of tricks as a catcher, making it impossible for other teams to predict when they hit the ball, so he often gives brilliant performances.</p>
<p>Looking at the skills of the above players, there is indeed great hope of winning the championship. The team leader is Dr. E. Sen, a famous Shanghai lawyer. The entire team wears gray uniforms, looking imposing and majestic, preparing to defeat the Westerners in this year's league and win glory for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>It is also heard that there are many famous teams in the league, such as the Western team, which has black pitching stars Ike and Osha. There is also the "Rustano" Red Team, the reigning champion, which has Fatty Tom Burer, a powerful player. In addition, the Zhuang, American, and Red Cross teams all have excellent skills and should not be underestimated. Moreover, the fastball pitcher of the Rustano team, Fatty Burer, is unmatched by other teams in his speed, and he is also good at hitting home runs, making him the soul of the team.</p>
<h3>This Sunday Morning: Battle Against Last Year's Champion</h3>
<p>The Panda Team is scheduled to compete against the "Lustanuo" Red Team, last year's champion, starting at 9:00 AM this Sunday (July 2nd). These two teams are the strongest in the league. When two heroes meet, there will inevitably be a fierce battle. Who will be victorious is unpredictable. Those who enjoy this sport can visit Jiaozhou Park to watch. Admission is free, and it will also cheer on our team. We hope that the Panda team members will do their best, strive forward, and win glory for us Chinese.</p>
<h3>Football Season Nearing Its End: Chinese League to Play Four Consecutive Matches</h3>
<p>This football season is fading away with the passage of time. The scorching summer is coming, the red umbrellas are raised high, and the heat is rampant. Players have been on the battlefield for a long time, and after the battles have just ended, it is time to rest and recuperate. However, charity matches are coming one after another. Fans can enjoy a few extra performances after the season ends, which is truly fortunate. There are four matches recently. Three have already been played, and there is still one today at Yi Yuan. Three of the matches are charity matches, and one is a friendly match. After watching the three matches, I have some feelings and would like to express my views briefly.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Charity Match: Chinese League Suffers First Defeat</h3>
<p>In this battle, the Chinese League first fought the Portuguese League. The latter adjusted its lineup, inviting former St. Francis College players, the Fu'en Pantuo Zhan Kun brothers, to help. However, the Chinese League's command was improper, resulting in sluggish offense and defense. Fu'en of the Portuguese League was active again, scoring four goals alone, defeating the Chinese League by a score of five to four. Chinese League goalkeeper Liu Xianhan was extremely flustered and unable to save the ball, which was also a major reason for the defeat. Fortunately, Li Yao Han Longhai worked hard, still managing to score four goals, which was their best effort. Observing this battle, we can believe that the most important thing in football is momentum and cooperation. Otherwise, even with great generals, it will become a pie in the sky, and it will be difficult to expect good results.</p>
<h3>Friendly Match: Chinese League Suffers Another Defeat</h3>
<p>The Chinese League's opponent was a police team. This time, the Chinese League focused on friendship in offense and Donghua in defense, making better adjustments. However, the weather was very hot that day, so there were few fans, and the players' spirits were lacking. Moreover, the ball was not in good condition, and they were down one to two in the first half. The police team relied on its abundant physical strength, and because its members had been resting for a long time, they were particularly energetic. Not long after the start of the second half, there was a heavy rain and strong winds. Although the players were still fighting hard in the rain, their performance was inferior. Both sides just muddled through in the water battle, and nothing was gained. The Chinese League lost one to two. In the first half, the Chinese League scored two goals, but both were disallowed for offside. The fans sighed in unison and felt that the referee was being overly strict. In fact, Huang Renyi's refereeing was indeed very dedicated.</p>
<h3>Chinese League Refreshes Lineup, Overcomes Japanese-German Team</h3>
<p>The Chinese League's third match was played yesterday, with the Chinese League facing the Japanese-German League. The former, ashamed of the two defeats, refreshed its lineup, emphasizing Donghua in offense and supplementing the center line of the Chinese League with Zheng Yingquan and Song Dian, which greatly improved its vitality. The Japanese-German League had many individual experts. Each player's technique was quite good, but their connection seemed a little lacking. The Chinese League's performance and offense were so elusive that they almost left the opponent at a loss. The skillfulness of You Liang and Long in their positions was beyond description. Ah Dai was also seen to be agile, scoring two goals. It can be said that this is rarely seen. It is unbelievable that Ah Dai, who is already old, can still have such a wonderful performance. Who said that he is old and useless? There is indeed a lack of such talent among the younger generation. Ah Dai has been playing on the field for more than ten years, and he can still be so imposing, which is enough to be proud of. As a result, the Chinese League won by four to two, and they missed many good opportunities and a penalty kick, otherwise, how many more goals would they have won?</p>
<h3>Today's Last Match: Chinese League to Play Portuguese Community Again</h3>
<p>This afternoon, a charity match sponsored by the Catholic Church will be held at Yi Yuan, with the Chinese League playing the Portuguese League again. This battle will be the last game of the season. Looking at the completeness of both sides' lineups, it can be believed that it will be a wonderful farewell game for the season. The Portuguese team's style is quite similar to that of the Chinese team, and they are also good at meticulousness. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Chinese League will pay the most attention to the distribution of its lineup. They should respond to the other side's personnel and make adjustments accordingly, then victory will be very certain.</p>
<h3>Sidelines in the Sports World</h3>
<p>Zhu Tufang is a very popular volleyball player. Yesterday, the reporter went to the Youth Association to watch the various events. The Green Team and the Long Team both had her name on the list. Everyone wanted to know which team this volleyball star would join.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Cup Xia Guangzhai Two Basketball League will be held one after another, so that the lonely basketball world can be prosperous for a while. Chen Zhong, Zhang Juefei, and others will definitely work hard.</p>
