<h3 id="c1">大學敎育的當前問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>在此非常時期，促進敎育之正常發展，以爲百年樹人之計，可說是今日復興民族建設新國家的基本事業。本報有鑒於此，爰特召集大中小學敎育座談會及大學生座談會，藉以充分了解當前敎育事業的實際情况，虛心研討當前發展敎育的具體任務。大學敎授座談會，業於本月四日舉行，承各敎授坦白發言，共抒所見。</p>
<p>依據此次大學敎授座談會的紀錄，我們可以看出大學敎育當前急切問題，不外爲改善敎授生活問題，推進助學金問題，擴充理工科問題，大學生課本及參考書問題等等。除將座談會紀錄整理發表之外（參閱今日本報第二版），我們覺得對於有關各方面尚有略獻蒭見的必要。</p>
<p>首先，關於改善大學敎授生活問題，也就是維持現有大學敎育，並進一步求其正常股展的先決問題，我們希望敎育當局向有關方面洽商具體辦法，務使敎育界工作人員都能享受生活必需品的特種配給，最近市政當同核准敎職員特種配米辦法，誠是值得欣幸的。同時，更希望書最大可能擴充之。我們始終認史敎育是國家的事業，因此敎育工作人員生活的改善，必須首先由政府負責，才能確實有效。共次，我們希望公私各校當局，實行經濟公開，學費增加及學校其他收入增加，則必須依合理比例，增加敎職員的薪給。學校究竟不是商店，希望學校當局大家自肅，保持敎育崇高的令譽，洗刷目前傳流的學店等恥辱稱呼。</p>
<p>其次，目前大學敎育的第二個危機是廣大靑年的失學問題，由於生活費用日高而有日趨嚴重之勢，不乏優秀的高中畢業生及同等程度者，因家境困難而不克繼績升學，亦有不少大學生因不勝負担而被逼輟學，未來國家社會的損失，眞是不可估計。本報的助學金運動即以此而舉辦，但數年來因助學金不足而坐視多數靑年有向隅之嘆，益增不安。我們今日一方面希望各界隨時互相勸勉，踴躍輸助。一方面我們當依此次座談會的意見，多救助實科學生，多選拔眞材。同時也有賴於敎育當局，學校當局和其他助學軍動的熱烈推行者一致協助推進。</p>
<p>關於理工科實習問題和大學生課本及參考書問題，此次大學敎授座談會提出了非常珍貴的意見。張友琴先生建議本報發起舉辦中央實騐室一點，尤有意義。同時希望各方面對此計劃多多發表意見及具體辦法，務求切於實際情形而有助於理工科敎育之發展。此外大學生課本及參考書問題在目前也十分嚴重，一書之費，動輒數千元，尤非普通薪水階級的家長所能負担。我們固然希望各界進行捐書捐款運動，各大學及各圖書館自動善籌解決辦法，但總是消極的辦法　積極辦法，唯有各磊書局如商務·中華·世界·中國聯合出版公司等，從連就磊學需要書藉編譯出版，以供大學學生之需要。這是出版界應有的責任。</p>
<p>最後，我們必須鄭重指出以下兩點：第一，大學敎育是造成國家社會領袖人才的基本工作，一個國家大學敎育的優良與否，可以看出這個國家有沒有領袖人才。第二，據人們所知，本學期各大學入學試騐程度，大體上都見　低，這是非常嚴重而值得憂慮的現象。我們希望有關當局及各方面特別注實這兩點，進而對上述四個問題共謀迅速妥善的解決。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日首相昨晨廣播　決强力推行施策　勗國民以大無畏精神奮鬥 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日小機首相八日晨六時半舉行廣播，題爲「當此大詔奉戴日」，其大旨如次：本人昨天於議會中曾關述決戰時局下之政府施策，然該施策並非從新計劃者，乃係過去政府各機關實施政策中之重點，主要問題在如何以强力將六急速實現。依本人所信，强力政治並非以强權推行政策之謂，乃一億同胞自動欣然與政府政策之共嗚，而以最短時間强力實行之者。當此曠古以來之重大時局下，各種困難恐日愈加重，吾人必須堅持決意，戰至最後，深望國民諾君對此以大無畏之精神，視目前所受之困難，於戰勝英美之重大關頭上，其代價實相當低廉。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日小磯首相於七日臨時議會上發表施政方針演設時，會率直表明，朝鮮及台灣在決戰下已成爲日本有力之一部，且正分別發揮其戰時之特質，協力達成戰爭目的。因此，常局充分考慮對該兩外地之處置，由是兩外地將爲日本之一環，負起重大使命，與內地渾然一體，向完遂聖戰之途邁進。因此，在統治外地之現階段中，即將採取政府此種重要國策，藉謀獲得積極之進展。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日衆院緊急會議　通過軍費追加案　貴院昨下午開預算總會 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日本議會第二（八日），適爲大詔奉戴日，命場爲嚴肅所籠罩，展開本格的決戰論議，本日之衆議院合議，首先由松村，安籐兩氏對首相演說提出强烈之質問，小磯首相對此，以直率信誠態度，加以解釋，政府及議會互相協力邁進，突破難局之明朗氣勢，充滿會塲一。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日臨時議會衆院入日議程，午前十時開始本議會，當即對施政方針演說加以質疑，由松村謙三，安藤正純兩氏自物心兩方面，各對政府之決心强化各施策，加以詳細檢討。午後一時，舉行預算總會，首爲佐藤，多田陸海兩軍務局長報告戰况，繼為石渡藏相說明臨時軍事費提案理由，對此，太田正孝氏會提出質疑，經慎重審議，予以通過。午後三時，再度開始本會議，對緊急奏文，一致採決，送交貴族院，繼樂行預算總會，於追加預算案之議題下，由木暮森田，松永諸氏對軍需增產，國民動員，飛機增產等各問題，提出質問。午後六時，由政府說明物資動員關係。又貴族院八日未舉行本會議，於收到衆議院之臨時軍事費案後，下午三時始開始預算總會，聽取政府說明，即日採決，並預定交九日之本會議。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　八日衆議院預算總會，下午一時三十分召開，勝田委員長致開會詞後，即由石渡藏相說明左列四提案理由：　昭和十九年度歲八歲出總預算追加案，　昭和十九年度特別會計歲入歲出預算追加案，　關於預算外國庫負担之契約案，　臨時軍事費預算追加案，至一時五十五分遂即入於秘密會程。下午六時二十五分，秘密會宜告圓滿閉會。勝田委員長發表如次：秘密命關於臨時軍費案，先由大藏，陸，海軍各大臣說明理由，繼由佐藤陸軍，多田海軍　軍事務局長報告戰況，委員會與當局之聞，即開始入於間答軍事，此後各議員即稍事休息。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日衆議院七時三十五分再度召開緊急會議，提出臨時軍事費預算追加案，由預算委員長勝田永吉氏報告委員會之經過及結果，全塲一致表決後，送交貴族院，七時四十分即行散會。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日本石渡藏相，八日在預算總會席上，闡述如次：昭和十九年度預定發行之公債，迄目下止，已發行九十四億一千二百餘萬元，其中一般承購者之承購率，約佔十分之九。</p>
<h3 id="c4">作戰到底　全力完遂戰爭　松島部長披瀝日决心 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部昨（八日）下午二時，循例在海軍武官府招待上海各報記者，松島部長鹽田大尉均出席發表談話。鹽田大尉在松島部長因重要公出未蒞會前，向記者解：</p>
<p>兩島戰士抗戰仍烈敵於期月二日在大宮島登陸，七月廿三日在迭尼安島登陸，數句以來兩島日守備隊，猛烈抗戰，予敵重大打擊。於晚可見兩島上作戰之砲火，因通信聯絡不甚充份，無法獲得日戰士之抗戰詳情，但被等之英勇精神，不難想像而得。</p>
<p>敵美民衆痛苦漸深日本全國民衆，與兩島作戰之勇土，具有同等忍而精神，準備未來之天決戰，敵方人士在其自身觀察，以爲對日作戰，具有七分勝利把握，日本僅有三分勝利希望。但日本國民信念，以爲與敵有同等之觀感，吾人實抱有七分勝利把握，至少亦有對等態勢。美國民衆受戰事痛苦，已逐　深刻，最近有兩事足爲諸君述：　自八月下旬起，美國巳禁止民間使用大型汽車及公共汽車，同時對於樣膠之輪出，已予限制。　美國戰爭物資調查指揮官陸軍少將露西亞·斯克來姆，最近報告彈藥生產情形，謂美國最近彈藥生產，將遭遇最大危機。某戰區司令長官，曾經要求補充彈藥，而未能獲得。同時英訂製一噸重炸彈一干枚，亦因製造不可能而遭拒絕，其原因爲人力不足，而不能生產如理想之　　。在多數重要問題中，彈藥生產亦爲其一，如此問題不能獲得解決，對戰爭前途，殊雖樂觀。</p>
<p>戰後妄想誘致國民戰爭之勝負，須決於國民之信念堅定與否，美當局因國民戰爭勝利信念薄弱，爲昂揚其戰意計，常以戰後妄想情況情殊可憫。今日日本臨時宣示無遺，同時日本國民之戰勝信念，將因此更爲堅定盬田大尉言至此，松烏部長已於匆忙巾撥冗出席，繼續發表談話謂：</p>
<p>日德同盟作戰到底頃與德國在滬當局聯絡，深悉德國作作戰精鉀，極爲堅强。據得方人士謂，德國現雖被圍，但全國人民，均具右戰至一兵一卒，亦不屈服之決心。自目前起，大泱戰方行開始。吾人對盟邦德國之堅强意志表示，員有同感。日本在任何周圍變化之下，其作戰初志，亦不變更。此次日本臨時議會之舉行，亦爲加强傾力完遂戰爭之意念。日本今後之方針，無論在戰略上，政略上，始終在發揚大東亞建設理念，政戰兩略，都有充分的準備，其情況已自分散的態勢，轉向集中的態勢，所有在政戰兩略上所發生的小問題，亦將被掃除盡爭。</p>
<p>彈力强日不可侮美海軍長官佛涕斯德本月五日在華盛頓發表談話謂：美海軍在過去雖有相當整備，但對今後作戰前途，困難極多。日本海軍有相當之準備，恐至來年，無論在技術上及物量上均將遭遇日本强大力量之威脅。佛氏所言，寬為吾人極好之代言人，日本為發揮其力量，有極多的施策與整備，尤其在戰略的姿態上，誠如佛氏所言有極大準備。佛氏並謂：日本背後有亞洲大陸，附近有南方各島嶼，吾人如調攻擊日本，能如攻擊馬紹爾及塞班之勿，買爲極大錯誤。同時在政治上，有中國與之同盟，蘇聯與之保持友好關係，可稱爲不敗的姿態，今後日本將如彈簧，壓之更甚，其反彈力亦必强，此點誠不難想燬。</p>
<p>第一綫機將增數倍日本國民士氣，極爲與盛，今日爲大詔奉戴日，僅海軍武官府一處，已接受獻機達六架之多，足見日本民氣之激昂。吾人爲維護日本之光榮歷史，與救助中國之命，決作戰到底。八月九日美國發表迭尼安島及大宮島之作戰之停止，但在一個月後之今日，兩烏抗戰，事實仍存在。吾人計算塞班作戰爲四十日，大宮島作戰已五十日，迭尼安戰亦達四十七日，可知日將士作戰力之猛烈。關於日本飛機增產，近來非常成功，在最近之將來，派往第一綫作戰之飛機，將數倍於敵機，訓練純熟之日飛行士，現正整裝待發，近有人詢問何以日本飛機當澈機製日本之際，不在上海附近與敵機作戰，吾人答復其原因有二：　在使敵機多耗赴日之燃料，　在貯蓄作戰實力，進備大規模殲敵。</p>

<p>爪加爾達八日中央社電　爪哇基於日小磯首十一日分別樂行州參議會及中央參議會。</p>
<p>爪加爾達八日中央社電　當地日軍政監部，當日小磯首相於議會發表新施策之同時，特招請中央參議院長斯加爾諾氏，傳　首相之聲明，該氏聞悉後，已代表當地五千萬民衆，衷心表示感激。軍政監部並動員一切報紙，一致發行號外，廣播報告全鳥市民聚集於廣播機覽，靑年團學生等高唱愛國進行曲及印度內西亞民族巡迴於街頭，擴音汽車，亦飛馳名角落，黃昏之市尚，已爲歡喜與昂奮，市民住宅均高揭日旗及紅自族旗，客歲三月日軍登陸時之風光一時又得重現。</p>

<p>德國七日各報，對日臨時議會小磯首相之演說要旨，均曾大加登載，足見德國國民關心東亞之程度。對此，德外交部當局並曾聲述如次：小磯首相之演說，予決戰下德國民之印象極深，日本國民現與德國國民同樣正臨民族存亡之關頭，欲得最後勝利，必須以國民總崛起爲前題。又關於小磯首相對國家總動員體制之說明，亦使正爲戰爭而努力之德國民衆，受一絕大激勵。</p>

<p>東京八日中央社電　日軍七日晨八時五十分，突入零陵巿街，隨之佔領該城，渝美空軍之重要據點零陵機塲，全部入於日軍掌握，目下日軍仍繼續向前挺進。按零陵機塲與寶慶·衡陽·丹竹·芷江·等機塲，同為敵桂林地區航空基地之一　。故此次衡陽，零陵，失陷後，敵桂林地區航空基地完全陷入半身不遂狀態，渝美空軍之主力，被迫向昆明基地後退，而茍延殘喘於江西一角之贛州·遂川·等前進基地，更因衡腸·零陵·兩機塲之陷落，接濟路綫完全切斷，已走上自滅之途。</p>

<p>某某基地六日中央社電　大陸方面日軍於渝方之驚惶，及英美茫然失措之期間，古領衡陽後，最近已完畢兵員及諸物資之充分接濟，更向內地渝方各據點開始進擊。渝方猜測日軍恐一舉席捲，該方面之美駐渝空軍最重要據點之桂林，戰戰兢兢擬阻止日軍之進擊，但全綫連戰連敗之渝軍，到底不能阻止日軍之進路。此點渝方專門家亦自認，日軍如企圖攻佔桂林，則桂林之陷落，爲時間問題。渝方爲掩飾此決定的頹勢起見，乃積極宣稱「日軍之大陸作戰並無價値」，即據彼等之宣傳，謂「當茲日本本土之所受威脅，刻已增大之際，今日開始此種作戰　已遲一年至二年矣」。此種宣傳當然因大陸軍事失敗而欲轉移衆目，强調太平洋方面之渝軍攻勢，以欺滿全世界。然則一觀太平洋戰局，彼等究獲舉如何實績乎？實費幾多時日，且消耗無數人命與物資後，始佔有一握之南洋小島嶼，或僅達到轟炸菲島南端部之程度。換言之，日本在太平洋上殆並無喪失，日本本土不必言，即菲島。婆羅洲。西里伯·蘇門答臘·爪哇·馬來半島·所有各地依然掌握於日本手中。又最重要者，即日本之强力聯合艦隊，今尙完全健在，泰然待機將來之決戰，故「威脅刻刻增大中」者，與其謂係日本本土，不若謂係肩負龐大之接濟路綫，而向日本之强固內綫桃戰之敵陸海空軍爲得當。又敵明確暴露自已之接濟力，以在薩班島一帶海域爲最大限度，且此事爲敵方專門家所一致承認者，尼密茲以次敵將均衆口一詞稱，「完遂對日戰爭，結局祇有以中國大陸爲根據地而實施」，微之此間情形，已極明瞭。此點日方亦全具同感，日軍依據此種戰略的見地，逐次佔領長沙·衡陽·麗水·等大陸敵基地，敵將仍稱日軍作戰已失時機，或可謂無價値乎？但事實如上述，時機極爲迫切，且其價値在彼我之攻防上具有不可測之意義。要之，現在日軍在大陸破竹追擊，徹底擊碎敵之作戰計劃，一方面在太平洋正面，準備將來之一決戰。强力之海空兵力，如滿引之弓，凜然對敵，陸海空渾然一體，融通無碍，處於强靭之戰略態勢之日本，更何感敵之威脅乎？關於大東亞戰爭現階段，刻刻感威脅增大者，正在英美之聯合陳綫而已。</p>

<p>布達佩斯八日中央社電　東南歐洲風雲之緊張已達極點，德蘇英美四國政戰兩略之攻勢，刻亦正酣，綜合各方消息，其目下情勢大耍如次：</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞境內　集結大軍</p>
<p>「羅馬尼亞方面」，自羅馬尼亞北部及勃拉素夫（Brasov）至多瑙河間全綫，業被蘇軍佔領，今後蘇軍更將結集大兵，繼續沿多瑙河西進攻洪牙利，佔領外錫爾凡尼亞山地，一方而待蘇羅兩國成立和平交涉後，英美兩國駐西亞之空軍即將移駐羅馬尼亞。</p>
<p>德抗戰第一綫　移洪牙利</p>
<p>「洪牙洪政府得德軍之支援，毅然對蘇羅兩國從事防衛作戰，一日晨德軍自南方反攻，進擊羅馬尼亞，佔領外錫爾凡尼亞之南部，阻止蘇軍之西進，刻正與嚴軍激戰中。蘇政府從來對洪牙利之態度，及莫斯科廣播電台指摘洪新首相拉加托斯將軍爲攻擊蘇聯之責任者，由是觀之，可知蘇聯之謀略及蘇軍意岡，洪現內閣洞察此種情勢，決意與蘇軍一戰。最近德軍參謀總長格迭利安將軍曾赴布達佩斯，與洪軍當局懇談，其後德軍即陸積開抵洪牙利，刻洪牙利已爲軸心軍之第一綫，並傳德軍當局已決定將東南歐德軍中樞機關遷入洪國。</p>
<p>蘇幾海峽方　伸展勢力</p>
<p>「保加利亞」據斯丹埠訊，保加利亞國內德軍，已於有秩序中撒退，傳摩拉維夫內閣刻於洪羅國境基地，與蘇聯政府推行談判，蘇聯要求保加利亞國內爲軍事基地，一部分蘇軍業自盧斯（Russe）方面進入保境，故最近穌軍若干部隊將開入保國，現今保國內共黨勢力逐漸抬頭，將來或成立共黨內閣，再與英美兩國作和平交涉。蘇軍勢力自海峽地方伸展，因此蘇土兩國關係益惡化，故英美蘇三國之折衝微妙，當可預想。</p>
<p>北義反軸心軍　圖新登陸</p>
<p>德軍當局鑒於義大利方面反軸心軍之動向，推測其或於列米尼（Rimini)威尼斯間，或於伊斯脫里亞半島（Istria），此事亦有可能，據斯丹埠電傳，德軍現自愛琴海各島撤退業已完畢，其他希臘。舊南斯拉夫。斯洛伐克之一部亦巳撤退，刻德軍擬自黑爾郭蘭至義北部構成一新防綫，當洪牙利方面德軍奮勇抵抗之際，反軸心軍必將予義北部開始新登陸作戰，實可預測也。</p>
<h3 id="c16">從蘇聯歸來 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>優遇前綫將士</p>
<p>對第一綫戰爭中的將士之給與，無微不至。衣料食料待遇極爲豐厚，毫不感到一點不便。後方的勞働者，每天不過配給五五〇公分麵粉，而第一綫將士則配給一公斤。他如罐頭食物，牛油，果物，烟草等，亦配給極豐。此爲第一綫歸來將士所談者。</p>
<p>第一綫將士的這種豐衣足食，實由減低後方市民的日常生活至最低限度而後致此。麵包，肉類，牛油，什糧等，雖憑票配給，但除麵包以外，未必依規定的數量全部配給。即以麺包而言，勞働者每天五五〇公分，勤務員四五〇公分，孩童三（〇公分，亦不能果腹。</p>
<p>可是市民對其所任工作，絕對不容因枵腹之感而即懶慵。戰時下蘇聯的勞働規律，極為嚴厲。動務員及勞働者的每天勞働時間，自八時至十一時，但超過親定時間二十分後，縱遲一分，亦立即付裁判。公判的結果，大多數均處懲役刑。某事務員辛動工作了十五年，矢忠矢勤，但在本年初有一次遲到之十四·五分鐘，即處五個月的懲役。這是筆者最近所耳聞的實話。在後方服務的勤務員勞働者，其生活殆受與軍律相近的勞働規律所限制。</p>
<p>蓋第一綫與後方同為戰塲，那第一綫交戰的將士，與在衙門工作的，在工廠做工的勞働者，事務員等，亦服從同樣的規律。後方的底力，由此始能發揮。</p>
<p>前面已經說過，在蘇聯，無論第一綫，後方，都組織成整個戰塲。在這種國民組織下，後方在其生產活動與勤勞體制上，均被要求着與第一綫一樣的規律與國民的犧牲。所以在後方勞働的市民們，社會上對之與第一綫日夜作戰的將士們一樣，加以特別的敬意，而第一綫的將士也對後方表示十分的敬意與感謝。這樣一來，在戰時下的蘇聯，旣沒有軍·官·民的差別之分，也沒有第一綫與後方的差別之分。後方以不遜於第一綫的矜持與責任，從事生產勞働。這種國內體制的軍事化，國民生活的兵營化，在推進國防國家體制的過程上，乃當然表現的現象，在德蘇戰爭勃發前即已急於完成國防國家體制的蘇聯，在政策的各方面可以看出其動向。而且在此次德蘇戰爭勃發後，蘇聯政府所取的政策看來，向國內體制的軍事化，軍事的組織之整頓這一方向前進的形跡，淸晰可見。試舉若干則具體的例十如下：</p>
<p>着元帥服的史太林</p>
<p>史太材氏自最高會議幹部會任命爲為元帥後，革命以來二十五年從未脫却的黨服，換上了元帥服。德黑蘭會談吿終後，與羅斯福·邱吉爾合攝的紀念照片上所見的史太林氏，着元帥服，在本年二月最高會議中，亦着元帥服出現。在克林姆宮自己的辦公室中處理國務時，或在會議，會見中，無論何時，史太林氏均御元帥服。在戰時下的今日，史太林氏不用共產黨書記畏的資格，而用最高軍司令官的資格，從克林姆宮指揮一切。又黨政治局員的巨達諾夫，伏洛希大，希却巴可夫三氏均被任爲大將。這些人們，雖不在第一錢育接指揮軍隊，或在列寗格勒區（巨達諾大），或在烏克蘭（伏洛希夫）從事黨務活動，但除黨政治局員的資格外，再加大將稱號，實際上是必要的，便利的。軍與黨的一元化，也從外表與形式上進行着。委員制的廢除，也可說是出現於同一樣上的事象。</p>
<p>蘇聯的鐵道，水遝，自一九四三年四月起，處於戒嚴狀態下。對鐵道從業員職務上的罪行，與紅軍軍人負同樣責任，其犯罪行爲由鐵道軍法會議審理。鐵道從業員的組織，也與以軍隊同樣的階級與規律。外交官及司法官官等的制定上，附肩章的制服之服御上，在這種種上有着轉代的意義。蘇聯的文官，其職務上的地位，例如局長或課長等聯名，雖爲以前所有，但所謂高等官的級，則無之。但自去年制定外交官及司法官的等級以後，則服御與軍隊一樣附有大肩章的制服。例如外務人民委員附元帥肩章，公使級附中將肩章。去年十一月七日的革命記命日，本年二月二十三日的紅軍紀念日，招待外交團的茶會中，莫洛托夫外長以下的外交部官吏，全部着此種服裝招待我們。這樣，對上級長官，一見他們的制服與制帽，就自然而然的行軍隊式敬禮。今日有此種官等與制服者，雖僅交通，外交，司法三人民委員部，但此種文官制度，普及於其他文官方面的可能性也頗多。余親此爲文官制度的軍事化。（翔：譯自八月十九日朝日新開）</p>

<p>陳兼團長訓詞</p>
<p>上海特別市自警團團本部定於今日正式成立，陳兼團長特向全市自警團員致訓如下：「大東亞戰爭已臨到決勝的階段，照現在激烈情况而論，已無前後方的區分，所以上海市民，應配合時代趨勢而前進，在此千鈞一髮之際，不能躊躇，不能徘徊，現一在努力一分，抵得過已往的十分，現在前進一步，抵得過巳往的十步。</p>
<p>埋頭苦幹振作精神</p>
<p>諺語說：「天助自助」，先要自助，然後能得天助，所以我們要有埋頭苦幹百折不同的勇氣，振作國民服務的精神，塀絕口私自利的心理，恢復我國古有的任俠仗義的美德，來保障國家民族的生存。在消極方面，亟須排除個人主義，和「各人自掃門前雪」的茍安心理，檢舉擾亂治安，腐蝕社會的一切不良份子，消滅作奸犯科的內在因素，制止狂暴兇惡的橫行。在積極方面，更須倡導全體主義，灌輸國家民族觀念，使一般市民，改變其「袖手旁觀」「隔岸觀火」「茍且偷安」的卑鄙態度，振奮而起，協助警察，查奸弭亂，救急防空，結集五百萬市民整個的力量，確立大上海治安的基礎，來保衛全體市民生命財產的安全。凡此種種當前急務，均應由自警團來承負其責任，因此上海特別市警察局目警團團本部，質有迅速成立的必耍，以　達到警保協力，警保聯繫，具體發揮「守望相助」「患難相扶持」，中國固有道義精神，下最大的決心，克服困苦的環境，在驚濤駭浪之中，堅定信念，官民合作，且風雨同舟之感，加强保甲的服務精神，幫助軍憲，維獲大上海的治安，政府與人民整個結合，整個動員，將中央與市府警局，及高級保甲層，貫串一氣，這呌做立體動員，把軍事政治經濟文化同時推進，道呌做平面動員，這樣縱的一貫執行，橫的同時並進，才能確收治安的實効。</p>
<p>自强不息發奮為雄</p>
<p>我們在這緊要關頭，要自强不息，要發奮爲雄，不能半途而廢，功虧一簧，成敗得失，繫於一念之轉移，把自已的勞力，來決定自己的命運，來改造自己的環境，不因自己受苦而呌寃，能忍受常人所不能忍受的千辛萬苦，才能成就常人所不能建樹的偉大事功。我們要立志做風雨飄搖中捨已利人的義士，不要做「唯己」「唯利」的劣導人。世界上「唯利」「唯已」的人，喪失祖國，歷史有很多的先例，大家都應該反省，我們有沒有唯利唯己的心理，有沒有唯利唯己的舉動，假如有的，我們應該要痛心疾首地革除。孔子說：「君子喩於義。小人喩於利」，義利之辨，不僅在德行上為君子小人之別，在事功上即是成敗得失之所由分。我們警保人員「喩義」的實　，就是實行警保聯繫，同舟共濟個個爲大衆服務，個個爲大衆犧牲，只右熟心服務的人，是永遠受人歡迎的，只有慷慨犧牲的人，才能成就美滿的事業，樹立美滿的聲名。</p>
<p>保障大上海的安定</p>
<p>即就自警服務而論，在維持治安方面，如防空，消防，救護等急救工作，如守望，　報，巡察，封鎖，抽查戶口等弭亂工作，在增進社會福利方面，如淸潔街道，預防疾疫等衛生工作，扶助老弱，保護婦嬰，調整交通秩序，以及其他建設增產等工作，依據任俠，唯義，耐勞，互助的這義精神，透過警保合作的壁壘，建立警保聯合的陣營，保障大上海永久的安定，以爭取大東亞最後的勝利，本兼團長對此實具有無窮的熱望。現在團本部人事已經確定，本兼局長兼任團長，市警局高級官吏，分擔主要職務，各級保甲人員，擔任大隊中隊各隊長和班長，團本部附設於巿警察局內，本兼團長以下各數人員，即日視事，啓用關防，希望警保人員，以及全體市民通力合作，共策進行，不要放棄匹夫之責，基於「人人爲我，我爲人人」的原則，以「只圖耕耘，不問收穫」的決心，不圖個人利益，但求國家民族之安全，做一番救地方救國家的事業，望諸位一致努力。</p>

<p>大學敎授座談會</p>
<p>本報鑒於近年上海一般敎育效能，日趨低落。熱心敎育人士，莫不引以爲憂。當此學期開始之際，爲檢討研究改進方針，爰擬舉行座談會交換意見。於九月四日下午四時假工商聯誼會首先舉行大學敎授座談會，出席者沈嗣良·黃嘉德·應懷貴·張友琴·劉鴻典·張伯鈞·尤其偉·何家鱗·唐慶增·林妹殊·徐正鏃諸先生，由本報社會服務處主任黃管頑君主席，茲紀錄談話耍點如下：</p>
<p>黃警頑：今天敝報召開座談會，承各大學敎授惠然參加，不勝欣幸！申報具有七十餘年的悠久歷史，向來代表民衆，發揮正論，不遺餘力；而於敎育文化事業，尤多所立論，盡量發揮，値此非常時期，欲求敎育正常發展，故發起召集大中小敎育座談會及大學生座談會，將於本星期內依次舉行，緖位皆係敎靑界領袖，高瞻遠矚，必有宏論發表，茲略舉數事，敬請不吝賜敎。</p>
<p>第一　改善敎授生活問題</p>
<p>黃警頑：敎育界的生活情形，苦不堪言，據我所知，大學敎授某君，原是胡適之留美時的同學，如今一日三餐薄粥，子女無力上學；某大學副校長每天穿了破衣服，提了菜籃上菜塲賈菜，他說因不雇娘姨，太太有病，只得自己吃點苦，敎授生活如比苦法，眞是太不公道了！</p>
<p>應懷貴：太學敎授要改善生活，當然首先要提高待遇，而且先要增加學費，但是學費增加，學生的負担就加重了。所以事實上兩面都有困難。就說下學期私立大學的待遇，最高的月薪有三萬餘元，比公立大學好得多了。像敝校國立上海大學，外表雖好，實際最多的月薪，還不上一萬，比起私立大學，眞是太起碼了。敎嶄無論如何提高，而物價飛漲，相形之下，依然不脫龜兎競走的公式。大學如此，中小學更是一大問題。最近當局有特種配給的提議，我希望在食糧及日用品方面，多多配給，比較有效。</p>
<p>張友琴：應先生的高見甚是。敎員以發給米糧爲最合需要，日用品還是其次，希望貴報多多鼓吹，也許有實現的可能。</p>
<p>黃嘉德二約翰大學敎授的待遇，與其他私立大學相彷，向來約輸所收學費較低，只好量入爲出，下學期酌加學費，敎授待遇可以提高些。</p>
<p>張伯鈞：國立大學所得部發的公費，總是不够的。敝校上海歸學院與上海大學情形相信，好在敝校敎授都是醫師，課餘執行診務，生活上可裨益不少。</p>
<p>唐慶增：誠正文學院敎授兼課的居多，薪給以鐘點計算，比較淸苦。</p>
<p>周澤甫：華東大學係之江東吳兩校合作，如兄如弟，頗爲融洽，待遇還好，本學期學費增加，即以所加學費照比例提高敎薪，無論何校，倘能照增加學費的比例加諸於敎員的薪給，則敎師待遇，自然可以改善，希望各校當局，切實執行。纔是公道。</p>
<p>林妹殊：大學敎援最好有團體糾織，步趨統一，共謀本身利益，則生活自可改善。</p>
<p>周澤甫：照各位的意見，歸納起來：　請申報竭力鼓吹，使敎育界享受米糧及日用品的特種配給，　各校當局經濟公開，所加學費，照比例加給敎員薪水。</p>
<p>第二　助學運動的檢討</p>
<p>黃警頑：本屆申報辦理續者助學金，有一事最感困難，即是學費增加，分配爲難；所幸上海善人多，肯解囊，還算有辦法。本屆對申請學生的體格，成績，家境，品性，四者並重，承各級學校多多幫忙，至爲感激，諸位對此有何卓見，請</p>
<p>劉鴻典：貴報辦理助學金，成效卓著，旣感粥少僧多，似應注重研究專門科學的學生，將來國家復興建設，在在需要科學人材，而研究科學者出路亦廣。</p>
<p>黃警頑：本報早已注意，照本屆核准學生的統計來看，在大學組方面，差不多十之七八是研讀實科的，學文科法科的，佔絕對少數。</p>
<p>慶慶增：貴報可採用考試方式，對大學生研習　科的舉行會試，以甄拔眞才實學之士，予以獎勵，倒也很有意義。</p>
<p>黃嘉德：約翰大學現在亦設有助學金，不過是小規模的試騐。</p>
<p>何家麟：南通學院校董及校友方面，也捐設助學金，一面調查學生家况，希望各大學能自動辦理，蔚為風氣，收效自宏。</p>
<p>黃警頑：歸納各位的意見：　助學金應多資助實科學生，　實行會試，選拔眞才。</p>
<p>理工科實習問題</p>
<p>黃警頑：戰後上海各大學校舍都是東遷西移，缺乏實騐室，學生所習，只是紙上談兵，不知諸位有何卓見？</p>
<p>張伯均：讀理工科的學生，少不了實騐室最好各校互相借用，以有易無，但一切責騐材料，購置非易，倘使互相借用，必定要嚴密管理，否則只顧自己，不顧他人，也會弊寶業生的。</p>
<p>張友琴：理工科如無實騐，所學即無用處，各校當然希望有完備的實騐室，惜無設備與適當的地點，最好請申報發起辦一巾央實騐室，地基，房屋，經費，由申報向各界勸募，材料藥品，則由各校自備，內中有專門人才負責指導，做實地研究的工作，這與工商界均有密切關係，何不積極進行，促其實現。</p>
<p>劉鴻典：這一計劃，極有意義，緣上海這樣大的地方，無謂消耗，到處皆是，提倡科學，誰不贊成？請申報登高一呼。</p>
<p>黃警頑：恐怕目前也不是容易，但申報盡量力做去。</p>
<p>第四　大學生讀本及參考書</p>
<p>問題</p>
<p>黃警頑：戰後物資缺乏，影響到大學生的書藉，外洋新書不來，文化交流發生窒碍，諸位有何意見？</p>
<p>張伯鈞：現在有借書辦法，或是互相交換，也是不得已的辦法。上海醫學院定有買·偕·租三個方法，不過限於一校，規模小，還算好辦。新書不易購，舊書可利用，每校各自辦理，租借書籍，大可實行。</p>
<p>應懷貴：貴報熱心社會服務，可否仿照借書辦決，擴大規模，爲各大學租借參考書，不過需要相當的經費與人力。</p>
<p>張伯鈞：最好請公私立圖書館辦理，較爲適宜，指定何類參考書，照章借閱，不致散失。</p>
<p>周澤甫：請申報商請各中心地點的圖書館辦理，勸社會各界人士捐書或捐款，爲無書可讀的大學生設想，可算是積極的善舉。</p>
<p>座談至此，鐘鳴七下，遂宣佈敝會。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Current Problems in University Education <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>In this extraordinary time, promoting the normal development of education as a long-term strategy for nurturing talent is undoubtedly a fundamental undertaking for national rejuvenation and the construction of a new country. Recognizing this, our newspaper has specially convened symposiums for education in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools, as well as symposiums for university students, in order to fully understand the actual situation of current educational endeavors and humbly discuss the specific tasks for developing education at present. The university professor symposium was held on the 4th of this month. We are grateful for the professors' candid remarks and shared insights.</p>
<p>Based on the records of this university professor symposium, we can see that the urgent problems facing university education today are none other than improving professors' living conditions, promoting scholarships, expanding science and engineering departments, and addressing the issues of university student textbooks and reference books, and so on. In addition to organizing and publishing the symposium records (see today's newspaper, page 2), we feel that it is still necessary to offer some humble suggestions on relevant aspects.</p>
<p>First, regarding the issue of improving the living conditions of university professors, which is a prerequisite for maintaining existing university education and further seeking its normal development, we hope that the education authorities will consult with relevant parties on concrete measures to ensure that education workers can enjoy special allocations of essential living supplies. Recently, the municipal authorities approved special rice allocation measures for faculty and staff, which is indeed gratifying. At the same time, we further hope to expand it to the greatest extent possible. We have always believed that education is a national undertaking, so the improvement of the living conditions of education workers must first be the responsibility of the government in order to be truly effective. Secondly, we hope that the authorities of both public and private schools will implement economic transparency. If tuition fees and other school income increase, the salaries of faculty and staff must be increased in reasonable proportion. Schools are ultimately not shops, and we hope that school authorities will exercise self-restraint, maintain the noble reputation of education, and wash away the shameful label of "academic shops" that is currently circulating.</p>
<p>Secondly, the second crisis in university education today is the problem of widespread youth being unable to attend school. As the cost of living rises daily and tends to become more serious, there is no shortage of outstanding high school graduates and those with equivalent qualifications who cannot continue their studies due to difficult family circumstances. There are also many university students who are forced to drop out because they cannot bear the burden. The loss to the future of the country and society is truly incalculable. Our newspaper's scholarship campaign was launched for this reason, but in recent years, we have been increasingly uneasy as we have watched many young people sigh in regret due to insufficient scholarships. Today, on the one hand, we hope that all sectors will encourage each other at any time and actively contribute. On the other hand, we will follow the advice of this symposium, provide more assistance to students in practical fields, and select genuine talent. At the same time, it also depends on the education authorities, school authorities, and other enthusiastic promoters of the scholarship campaign to work together to promote it.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of science and engineering internships and the issue of university student textbooks and reference books, this university professor symposium put forward very valuable opinions. Mr. Zhang Youqin's suggestion that this newspaper initiate the establishment of a central laboratory is particularly meaningful. At the same time, we hope that all parties will express their opinions and concrete measures on this plan, striving to be practical and conducive to the development of science and engineering education. In addition, the issue of university student textbooks and reference books is also very serious at present. The cost of a book often runs into the thousands of dollars, which is especially unaffordable for parents in the ordinary salaried class. We certainly hope that all sectors will carry out book and fundraising campaigns, and that universities and libraries will automatically find ways to solve the problem, but these are always passive measures. The active measures are only to have all major bookstores, such as Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, China United Publishing Company, etc., compile, translate, and publish books based on the needs of academic studies to meet the needs of university students. This is the responsibility that the publishing industry should bear.</p>
<p>Finally, we must solemnly point out the following two points: First, university education is the basic work of creating leading talents for the country and society. Whether a country's university education is excellent or not can show whether this country has leading talents. Second, as people know, the level of entrance examinations for universities this semester has generally declined, which is a very serious and worrying phenomenon. We hope that the relevant authorities and all parties will pay special attention to these two points, and then jointly seek a swift and proper solution to the above four problems.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Prime Minister Broadcasted Yesterday Morning, Deciding to Vigorously Promote Policies and Encouraging the People to Fight with a Spirit of Great Fearlessness <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Prime Minister Koiso gave a broadcast at 6:30 this morning, titled "On This Day of Receiving the Great Decree." The main points are as follows: I mentioned in the Diet yesterday the government's policies under the decisive battle situation. However, these policies are not newly planned, but are the key points of the policies implemented by various government agencies in the past. The main problem is how to quickly realize them with strength. I believe that strong politics does not mean pushing policies with power, but rather the automatic and joyful resonance of 100 million compatriots with government policies, and implementing them strongly in the shortest possible time. Under this unprecedented major situation, various difficulties may become more and more serious. We must persevere in our determination to fight to the end. I deeply hope that the people will face this with a spirit of great fearlessness, and consider the difficulties they are currently experiencing as a very low price to pay for the important moment of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a policy speech at the extraordinary Diet on the 7th, he frankly stated that Korea and Taiwan have become a powerful part of Japan in the decisive battle, and are respectively exerting their wartime characteristics to cooperate in achieving the goals of the war. Therefore, the Changju fully considers the handling of these two foreign territories, so that the two foreign territories will become a part of Japan, shoulder a major mission, be completely integrated with the mainland, and move towards the path of completing the Holy War. Therefore, in the current stage of ruling foreign territories, such an important national policy of the government will be adopted to seek positive progress.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Fighting to the End, Fully Accomplishing the War, Minister Matsushima Reveals Japan's Determination <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Fleet in China's Press Department held a reception for Shanghai reporters at the Naval Attaché's Office yesterday (8th) at 2:00 p.m., as usual. Minister Matsushima and Lieutenant Commander Shioda attended and gave speeches. Lieutenant Commander Shioda explained to the reporters before Minister Matsushima arrived due to important official duties:</p>
<p>The soldiers on the two islands are still fighting fiercely. The enemy landed on Omiya Island on the 2nd of the month, and on Tinian Island on July 23rd. For several months, the garrison troops on the two islands have been fighting fiercely, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. The artillery fire of the battle on the two islands can be seen at night. Because the communication is not very sufficient, it is impossible to obtain the details of the Japanese soldiers' resistance, but the heroic spirit of those people can be imagined.</p>
<p>The Suffering of the Enemy American People is Gradually Deepening. The entire Japanese people have the same spirit of endurance as the brave soldiers fighting on the two islands, and are preparing for the future decisive battle. People on the enemy side believe, based on their own observations, that they have a 70% chance of winning the war against Japan, and Japan only has a 30% chance of winning. However, the Japanese people believe that they have the same feeling as the enemy, and we actually have a 70% chance of winning, or at least an equal situation. The suffering of the American people from the war has gradually deepened. Recently, there are two things worth mentioning to you: Since the end of August, the United States has banned the civilian use of large automobiles and buses, and at the same time, restrictions have been placed on the export of sample rubber. American War Materiel Survey Commander, Army Major General Lucia Schramm, recently reported on the production of ammunition, saying that the United States' recent ammunition production will encounter the greatest crisis. A commander of a certain war zone once requested the replenishment of ammunition, but failed to obtain it. At the same time, an order for 1,000 one-ton bombs from the United Kingdom was also rejected because manufacturing was impossible. The reason is that there is insufficient manpower and it cannot be produced as desired. Among many important problems, ammunition production is also one of them. If such problems cannot be solved, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future of the war.</p>
<p>Post-War Delusions Induce the People. The victory or defeat of the war must be determined by the steadfastness of the people's beliefs. The US authorities, because the belief in the people's war victory is weak, often use post-war delusions to boost their fighting spirit, which is very pitiful. Today, Japan has clearly declared without omission, and at the same time, the Japanese people's belief in victory will become more steadfast because of this. When Lieutenant Commander Yan Tian said this, Minister Song Wu had already taken the time to attend in a hurry and continued to speak:</p>
<p>The Japan-Germany Alliance Will Fight to the End. Recently, I contacted the German authorities in Shanghai and learned that Germany's combat spirit is extremely strong. According to German sources, although Germany is currently surrounded, all the people in the country have the determination to fight to the last soldier and never surrender. From now on, the Great Dongya War is about to begin. We express our feeling with the strong will of our ally Germany. Under any surrounding changes, Japan's original intention to fight will not change. The holding of the Japanese Provisional Diet this time is also to strengthen the idea of fully accomplishing the war. Japan's future policy, whether in strategy or political strategy, will always be to promote the concept of Greater East Asia construction. Both political and military strategies are fully prepared. The situation has changed from a scattered state to a concentrated state, and all the small problems that have occurred in both political and military strategies will be eliminated.</p>
<p>With Strong Elasticity, Japan Cannot Be Insulted. US Navy Chief Forrestal said in Washington this month that although the US Navy has made considerable preparations in the past, there are many difficulties in the future of combat. The Japanese Navy is quite prepared, and it is feared that by next year, whether in terms of technology or quantity, it will encounter the threat of Japan's powerful forces. Mr. Fo's words are a very good spokesperson for us. Japan has many policies and preparations to exert its strength, especially in its strategic posture, as Mr. Fo said, it has made great preparations. Mr. Fo also said that Japan has the Asian continent behind it, and the southern islands nearby. If we attack Japan, we will make a big mistake if we buy as little as we attack the Marshall Islands and Saipan. At the same time, in politics, there is China allied with it, and the Soviet Union maintains friendly relations with it, which can be called an invincible posture. In the future, Japan will be like a spring. The more it is pressed, the stronger its rebound force will be, which is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The Number of Aircraft on the Front Line Will Increase Several Times. The morale of the Japanese people is extremely strong. Today is the Day of Receiving the Great Decree. The Naval Attaché's Office alone has received as many as six aircraft donations, which shows the high morale of the Japanese people. In order to maintain Japan's glorious history and rescue China's life, we are determined to fight to the end. On August 9th, the United States announced the cessation of operations on Tinian Island and Omiya Island, but one month later, today, the resistance on the two islands still exists. We calculated the operation on Saipan to be 40 days, the operation on Omiya Island to be 50 days, and the battle on Tinian Island to be 47 days, which shows the fierce combat power of the Japanese soldiers. Regarding the increase in Japanese aircraft production, it has been very successful recently. In the near future, the number of aircraft sent to the front line will be several times that of enemy aircraft. Japanese pilots who have been thoroughly trained are now ready to go. Recently, someone asked why when Japanese aircraft are being thoroughly manufactured in Japan, they do not fight the enemy aircraft near Shanghai. We answered that there are two reasons: To make the enemy aircraft consume more fuel to Japan, To save combat strength and prepare for a large-scale annihilation of the enemy.</p>

<p>German newspapers on the 7th all carried the main points of Japanese Prime Minister Koiso's speech at the Provisional Diet, which shows the extent to which the German people are concerned about East Asia. In this regard, the German Foreign Ministry stated as follows: Prime Minister Koiso's speech left a deep impression on the German people under the decisive battle. The Japanese people are now facing the moment of national survival, just like the German people. To win the final victory, it is necessary to take the total rise of the nation as a prerequisite. In addition, Prime Minister Koiso's explanation of the national mobilization system has also greatly inspired the German people who are working for the war.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Advancing Along the Xiang-Gui Railway, the Japanese Army Occupies Lingling, Another Unit Fiercely Attacks Baoqing from Yongfeng <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on September 8th that the Japanese army units preparing to fight in the area around Hengyang began operations in August, defeated the enemy forces in the area, and continued to attack. On the night of the 6th of this month, they captured the Lingling airport, and on the morning of the 7th, they captured the streets of Lingling City.</p>
<p>Hengyang, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a Japanese army front-line telegram, the elite Japanese army unit advancing southwest along the Xiang-Gui Highway completely occupied the Lingling Airport at 00:00 a.m. on the 7th.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 8th (Central News Agency) – An elite Japanese army unit defeated the resistance of the Chongqing 74th Army and 100th Army in the mountainous area west of Hengyang, and arrived 25 kilometers from Baoqing, the location of the US Air Force base stationed in Chongqing, on the morning of the 7th, and is currently launching a fierce attack on Baoqing City. Baoqing is the base of the Chongqing 24th Army Group, and is the only remaining US Air Force forward base in Hunan Province along with Zhijiang, and is now on the verge of extinction. In order to destroy it in one fell swoop, the Japanese army's pursuit troops are continuously eliminating the stubborn resistance of the Chongqing army and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and advancing smoothly.</p>
<p>The Occupation of the Airport is of Great Significance</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – At 8:50 a.m. on the 7th, the Japanese army broke into the streets of Lingling City and subsequently occupied the city. The important base of the Chongqing-US Air Force, Lingling Airport, was completely under the control of the Japanese army, and the Japanese army is still continuing to advance. Lingling Airport, Baoqing, Hengyang, Danzhu, Zhijiang, and other airports are all part of the enemy's Guilin area air base. Therefore, after the fall of Hengyang and Lingling this time, the enemy's Guilin area air base has completely fallen into a hemiplegic state. The main force of the Chongqing-US Air Force was forced to retreat to the Kunming base, and the forward bases in Ganzhou and Suichuan, which are lingering in a corner of Jiangxi, are on the path of self-destruction because the supply lines have been completely cut off due to the fall of the Hengchang and Lingling airports.</p>
<p>Seventy-One American Planes Were Shot Down</p>
<p>Hengyang, 8th (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the Japanese army base on the front line, since the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, it has successively captured important bases such as Changsha and Hengyang. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing suffered heavy blows, and is now making every effort to counterattack with B25 and P40 aircraft, etc., and the Japanese army's ground troops advancing on the enemy's base are also attacking fiercely at any time, launching fierce battles. Since the large-scale attack began in late May, 67 enemy aircraft have been shot down by the Japanese army's ground troops by September 6, and there are also 4 unidentified ones, which have yielded great results.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) – At 1:30 a.m. on the 7th, several Chongqing-US planes raided the Guangzhou area and blindly bombed the southwest of the city, causing more than 100 civilian casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Significance of Japan's Operations on the Mainland Is to Thoroughly Crush the Enemy's Plan <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>A certain base, 6th (Central News Agency) – During the period of panic on the part of Chongqing and the confusion of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese army on the mainland, after occupying Hengyang, recently completed the full replenishment of soldiers and materials, and began to attack the enemy's strongholds in the interior of Chongqing. Chongqing speculates that the Japanese army is afraid of sweeping away Guilin, the most important base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing in one fell swoop, and is tremblingly trying to prevent the Japanese army from advancing, but the Chongqing army, which has suffered successive defeats along the entire front, cannot stop the Japanese army from advancing. This point is also recognized by Chongqing experts, who admit that if the Japanese army attempts to capture Guilin, the fall of Guilin is only a matter of time. In order to cover up this decisive decline, Chongqing is actively proclaiming that "the Japanese army's mainland operations have no value," that is, according to their propaganda, "when the threat to the Japanese mainland is increasing, starting this kind of operation today is one to two years late." This kind of propaganda is of course intended to divert public attention and emphasize the Chongqing army's offensive in the Pacific in order to deceive the world due to the military failure on the mainland. However, if we look at the Pacific war situation, what kind of real achievements have they achieved? It took a lot of time and consumed countless lives and materials before they occupied a small island in the South Pacific, or only reached the point of bombing the southern end of the Philippine Islands. In other words, Japan has lost almost nothing in the Pacific. Not to mention the Japanese mainland, the Philippine Islands, Borneo, Celebes, Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, and all other places are still in the hands of Japan. The most important thing is that Japan's powerful combined fleet is still completely intact, and is calmly waiting for the future decisive battle. Therefore, the one whose "threat is increasing at every moment" is not so much the Japanese mainland as it is the enemy's land, sea, and air forces, which are shouldering a huge supply line and challenging Japan's strong inner line. Moreover, the enemy has clearly exposed its own supply power, taking the sea area around Saban Island as the maximum limit, and this matter has been unanimously recognized by enemy experts. Enemy generals from Nimitz to the next have all said in unison, "To complete the war against Japan, the final result is only to implement it with the Chinese mainland as a base." The situation here is extremely clear. The Japanese side also fully shares this feeling. Based on this strategic point of view, the Japanese army has successively occupied Changsha, Hengyang, Lishui, and other mainland enemy bases. Do enemy generals still say that the Japanese army's operations have missed the opportunity, or that they can be said to be worthless? But the fact is as mentioned above, the timing is extremely urgent, and its value has immeasurable significance in the offensive and defensive aspects of both sides. In short, the Japanese army is now pursuing the enemy with great momentum on the mainland, thoroughly crushing the enemy's combat plan, and on the other hand, is preparing for a future decisive battle on the Pacific front. The powerful naval and air power, like a fully drawn bow, stands majestically against the enemy. The Japanese, whose land, sea, and air forces are seamlessly integrated and in a strong and resilient strategic posture, are even more afraid of the enemy's threat? Regarding the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the one that is feeling the increasing threat at every moment is the United Kingdom and the United States' joint front.</p>

<p>Roosevelt and Churchill to Meet Soon</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Local newspapers report that the long-rumored Roosevelt-Churchill meeting appears likely to be held soon.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Political and Military Strategies Adopt Offensive Stance; Situation Urgent in Southeastern Europe; German Troops Withdraw from Southern Greece, Forming New Defensive Line <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 8th (Central News Agency) – The tension in Southeastern Europe has reached its peak. The offensive strategies of the four powers—Germany, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—in both political and military arenas are currently intensifying. Summarizing information from various sources, the current situation can be broadly outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Large Forces Assembled Within Romania</p>
<p>"In Romania," the entire line from northern Romania and Brasov to the Danube River has been occupied by Soviet forces. Moving forward, the Soviet army will assemble even larger forces and continue westward along the Danube River to attack Hungary, occupy the Outer Transylvanian Mountains, and await the establishment of peaceful negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania. Following this, the air forces of the United Kingdom and the United States stationed in West Asia will be transferred to Romania.</p>
<p>First Line of German Resistance Shifts to Hungary</p>
<p>"Supported by German troops, the Hungarian government resolutely engaged in defensive operations against the Soviet Union and Romania. On the morning of the first day, German troops launched a counterattack from the south, attacking Romania, occupying the southern part of Outer Transylvania, and halting the Soviet advance. Fierce battles are currently underway with the enemy. The Soviet government's past attitude towards Hungary, and the Moscow Radio Station's accusation of Hungarian Prime Minister Lakatos as responsible for attacking the Soviet Union, suggest the Soviet Union's strategy and military intentions. The current Hungarian cabinet is keenly aware of this situation and has decided to fight the Soviet army. Recently, German Chief of the General Staff General Guderian visited Budapest to confer with Hungarian military authorities. Subsequently, German troops successively arrived in Hungary. Currently, Hungary has become the first line for Axis forces, and it is rumored that German authorities have decided to move the central organs of the German military in Southeastern Europe to Hungary.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Extends Influence in Straits Area</p>
<p>"Bulgaria": According to reports from Istanbul, German troops within Bulgaria have withdrawn in an orderly manner. It is rumored that the Morawiecki cabinet is currently conducting negotiations with the Soviet government at a base on the Hungarian-Romanian border. The Soviet Union is demanding military bases within Bulgaria. A portion of the Soviet army has already entered Bulgarian territory from the Russe area. Therefore, some Soviet troops will soon enter Bulgaria. Currently, the power of the Communist Party within Bulgaria is gradually rising, and a Communist cabinet may be formed in the future to engage in peace negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States. As Soviet influence extends from the straits area, relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey are deteriorating. Therefore, the delicate negotiations among the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union can be foreseen.</p>
<p>Anti-Axis Forces in Northern Italy Plan New Landing</p>
<p>The German authorities, in view of the anti-Axis movement in Italy, speculate that it might occur between Rimini and Venice, or on the Istrian Peninsula. According to reports from Istanbul, the German evacuation from the Aegean Islands has been completed. Other parts of Greece, former Yugoslavia, and Slovakia have also been evacuated. Currently, the German army plans to form a new defensive line from Heligoland to northern Italy. While German troops in Hungary are resisting valiantly, it is predictable that the anti-Axis forces will launch a new landing operation in northern Italy.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Returning from the Soviet Union <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Generous Treatment for Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>The provision of supplies to the soldiers on the front line is meticulous. Clothing and food are extremely abundant, and they do not feel any inconvenience. Workers in the rear are rationed only 550 grams of flour per day, while soldiers on the front line receive one kilogram. Canned food, butter, fruit, tobacco, and other items are also supplied in abundance. This is what soldiers returning from the front line have said.</p>
<p>This abundant food and clothing for the soldiers on the front line is achieved by reducing the daily lives of citizens in the rear to the bare minimum. Although bread, meat, butter, and groceries are rationed, other than bread, the full quantity is not necessarily provided according to regulations. Even with bread, workers receive 550 grams per day, office workers 450 grams, and children 300 grams, which is not enough to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>However, citizens are not allowed to become lazy due to feelings of hunger in their assigned work. The labor regulations in wartime Soviet Union are extremely strict. The daily working hours for office workers and laborers are from eight to eleven hours, but even being one minute late after exceeding the allotted time by twenty minutes immediately results in judgment. The result of the public trial is usually a sentence of penal servitude. One office worker who worked diligently for fifteen years was sentenced to five months of penal servitude for being fourteen or fifteen minutes late once at the beginning of this year. This is a true story that I recently heard. The lives of office workers and laborers serving in the rear are restricted by labor regulations similar to military law.</p>
<p>In the Soviet Union, both the front line and the rear are battlefields. The soldiers fighting on the front line, and the laborers and office workers working in government offices and factories, are subject to the same regulations. This is how the strength of the rear is brought into play.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, in the Soviet Union, the front line and the rear are organized as a single battlefield. Under this national organization, the rear is required to maintain the same discipline and make the same sacrifices as the front line in its production activities and labor system. Therefore, the citizens working in the rear are treated with the same special respect as the soldiers fighting day and night on the front line, and the soldiers on the front line also express great respect and gratitude to the rear. In this way, there is no distinction between military, officials, and civilians, nor between the front line and the rear in wartime Soviet Union. The rear engages in production and labor with pride and responsibility no less than the front line. This militarization of the domestic system and the camp-like nature of national life are natural phenomena in the process of promoting a national defense state system. The Soviet Union, which was eager to complete its national defense state system before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, showed this trend in various aspects of policy. Moreover, the policies adopted by the Soviet government after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war clearly show the direction of militarizing the domestic system and reorganizing the military organization. Here are some specific examples:</p>
<p>Stalin Wearing a Marshal's Uniform</p>
<p>After Stalin was appointed Marshal by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, he replaced the party uniform that he had never taken off for twenty-five years since the revolution with a Marshal's uniform. In the commemorative photograph taken with Roosevelt and Churchill after the end of the Tehran Conference, Stalin is seen wearing a Marshal's uniform. He also appeared in a Marshal's uniform at the Supreme Soviet in February of this year. Whether handling state affairs in his office in the Kremlin, or in meetings, Stalin always wears a Marshal's uniform. In today's wartime, Stalin commands everything from the Kremlin not in the capacity of Secretary of the Communist Party, but in the capacity of Supreme Commander. Also, Zhdanov, Voroshilov, and Khrushchev, members of the Party Politburo, have all been appointed as Generals. Although these people do not directly command troops on the front line, or engage in party activities in the Leningrad region (Zhdanov) or in Ukraine (Voroshilov), the addition of the title of General to their qualifications as members of the Party Politburo is practically necessary and convenient. The unification of the military and the party is also proceeding from the outside and in form. The abolition of the committee system can also be said to be a phenomenon appearing on the same issue.</p>
<p>Since April 1943, the Soviet railway and waterways have been under martial law. Employees of the railway are held responsible for crimes related to their duties to the same extent as Red Army soldiers, and their criminal acts are tried by military courts. The organization of railway employees also follows the same rank and discipline as the military. The establishment of diplomatic and judicial official ranks, and the wearing of uniforms with shoulder boards, all have transitional significance. The position of Soviet civil servants, such as bureau chief or section chief, was previously linked to the name, but there was no such thing as a higher-ranking official. However, since the establishment of ranks for diplomatic and judicial officials last year, they have been wearing uniforms with shoulder boards like the military. For example, the People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs wears Marshal's shoulder boards, and the Minister wears Lieutenant General's shoulder boards. At the tea parties held to entertain the diplomatic corps on the anniversary of the revolution on November 7th last year and the anniversary of the Red Army on February 23rd this year, all officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Foreign Minister Molotov, wore this type of uniform. In this way, upon seeing the uniforms and hats of superiors, people naturally salute in a military style. Today, although only the People's Commissariats of Transportation, Foreign Affairs, and Justice have this type of official rank and uniform, there is a high possibility that this civil service system will spread to other areas of the civil service. I personally consider this the militarization of the civil service. (Xiang: Translated from Asahi Shimbun, August 19th)</p>

<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported on the 7th: Soviet troops simultaneously entered Bulgaria at three locations. This had been rumored as early as September 5th, and was carried out after the Soviet Union declared war on Bulgaria. Soviet tanks and mechanized units concentrated north of the Danube River crossed the river in the Giurgiu and Russe areas. The direction of this operation is towards the Aegean Sea. According to reliable sources, the vanguard of the Soviet army has reached the Demotka area. At the same time, another tank column is advancing towards Sofia, the Bulgarian capital. Due to the chaotic internal political situation in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian army does not appear to be putting up significant resistance. The new Bulgarian government is said to have agreed to allow Soviet troops to enter Bulgarian territory without a fight.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Today is the 9th Air Defense Day; Expanded Air Defense Training; In Addition to Comprehensive Training, Shelter Drills Will Be Conducted <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Today, the 9th, is the 9th Air Defense Day. The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters, recognizing the increasingly tense air defense situation, will not only intensify propaganda and post air defense slogans to alert citizens to air defense, but also expand air defense training. This includes: Alarm training, where measures will be implemented on time by police and Baojia personnel without sounding the siren, except for actual alerts when citizens must quickly take appropriate actions. Comprehensive training in various districts, improving upon past limited participation by including more areas and citizens, will be held at appropriate locations. The basic comprehensive training will gradually be extended to all citizens. Therefore, air defense personnel such as Baojia self-defense team members should thoroughly implement training, and the general public should focus on shelter drills to protect their lives during air raids.</p>
<p>Simulated Bombs Will Be Dropped During Today's Exercise</p>
<p>Today's large-scale air defense training exercise will cover all districts of the city. To ensure that citizens take the exercise seriously, simulated bombs will be dropped. It is hoped that Baojia self-defense team members and the general public will wear air defense clothing so that they can lie down and seek shelter anytime, anywhere, without hindrance. As soon as observation posts spot enemy aircraft or hear the sound of engines, they should immediately report it using megaphones, shouting "Aircraft!" If bombs are discovered, their type, time of fall, and location should be reported directly to the nearest police station using the fastest possible method. The type and power of the bombs are indicated on the paper simulated bombs being dropped. Simulated enemy aircraft will drop paper simulated bombs at any time after the air raid alarm is issued. The areas where the simulated bombs will be dropped are the prosperous urban areas south of the Suzhou Creek. The types of simulated bombs are listed below: Oil bombs (incendiary bombs) – red; explosive bombs – yellow; time bombs – black.</p>
<p>Creating Air Defense Shelter Song</p>
<p>The Municipal Air Defense Headquarters has recently created the "Shelter Song," which is very important for guiding citizens in seeking shelter during air raids. The original lyrics are recorded below: "Suddenly, changes arise in the clouds, Enemy planes are attacking, do not wait, Cannon fire shakes the sky, it is also dangerous, Men, women, old and young, enter the trench, Act quickly and take initiative, Lie down and kneel, do not look up, Glass and gravel can also hurt, Cover your ears and eyes, protect your head and shoulders, Little space, many people, causes chaos, Do not panic or rush ahead, Listen quietly to commands, maintain order, When the enemy leaves, everyone returns home safely."</p>
<h3 id="e21">Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters Established Today; Unifying and Centralizing the City's Self-Defense Forces <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of our country's entry into the war. In order to unify the city's self-defense corps and achieve close liaison between the police and Baojia, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has centralized the self-defense forces and formally established the Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters today. Director Chen will personally serve as the Corps Commander, and the Director of the Baojia Department will serve as the Secretary-General.

On the part of the Corps Headquarters, in view of the 9th Air Defense Day today, a large-scale air defense exercise will be launched in all districts of the city. At the same time, in order to promote the significance of the Baojia and report on the mission of the self-defense, so as to achieve the mission of police self-defense, the Self-Defense Weekly will be launched today, on the day of the establishment of the Corps Headquarters, and will be distributed to each Lianbao, Bao, and Jia for subscription, with subsequent issues published every Saturday.</p>
<p>List of Senior Internal Officials</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters, under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, will be formally established today. The Corps Headquarters will be located within the Police Department. The personnel of the department have been determined. The list of senior internal officials is as follows: (Corps Commander) Chen, concurrently the Director; (Secretary-General) Gu Jiwu, Director of the Baojia Department; (Deputy Secretary-General) Zhongyuan, acting Deputy Director of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Instructor) Hiraoka, Director of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; Gotō, Director of the Special High Department, concurrently; Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department, concurrently; (Deputy Instructor) Concurrently held by the Deputy Directors of the Police Defense, Special High, and Judicial Departments; (Supervisors) Concurrently held by the Branch Chiefs and Deputy Branch Chiefs of each police precinct, and Sasaki and Araki of the Baojia Department; (Chief of the General Affairs Section) Ding Zhuo, Secretary of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Compilation and Investigation Section) Xiao Gang, Section Chief of the Baojia Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Police Section) Takeda Jū, Section Chief of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Air Defense Section) Yamamoto Shin'ichirō, Section Chief of the Police Defense Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Social Section) Mitsushima Susumu, Section Chief of the Special High Department, concurrently; (Chief of the Crime Prevention Guidance Section) Zhang Canguang, Secretary of the Judicial Department, concurrently.</p>
<p>Address by Director Chen</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Self-Defense Corps Headquarters will be formally established today. Director Chen delivers the following address to all members of the city's self-defense corps: "The Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage. Given the current intense situation, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Therefore, the citizens of Shanghai should advance in line with the trend of the times. At this critical juncture, there is no room for hesitation or wavering. One point of effort now is worth ten points in the past. One step forward now is worth ten steps in the past.</p>
<p>Work Hard and Revive Spirits</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Heaven helps those who help themselves." We must first help ourselves, then we can receive divine assistance. Therefore, we must have the courage to bury ourselves in hard work, the spirit of national service, eliminate the psychology of selfishness and self-interest, and restore the ancient Chinese virtues of chivalry and justice to protect the survival of the nation and the race. On the passive side, we must eliminate individualism and the complacent mentality of "sweeping only the snow in front of one's own door," report all undesirable elements that disrupt public order and erode society, eliminate internal factors that commit crimes, and stop the rampage of violent and brutal forces. On the active side, we must advocate collectivism, instill national and ethnic concepts, change the despicable attitude of "standing idly by," "watching the fire from the other side," and "seeking temporary ease," and rise up to assist the police, investigate and eliminate traitors, provide emergency relief and air defense, and gather the entire strength of the five million citizens to establish the foundation of public order in Greater Shanghai to protect the safety of the lives and property of all citizens. All of these pressing matters should be assumed by the self-defense corps. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Department Self-Defense Corps Headquarters must be established quickly in order to achieve cooperation and liaison between the police and the Baojia, and to concretely bring out the inherent Chinese spirit of "mutual watch and assistance" and "mutual support in times of trouble." We must make the greatest determination, overcome difficult circumstances, and in the midst of storms, strengthen the spirit of service to the Baojia, help the military and maintain public order in Greater Shanghai with a firm belief in cooperation between officials and civilians and a sense of shared destiny. We must integrate the government and the people as a whole, mobilize the entire country, and connect the central government, the municipal government, the police department, and the high-level Baojia in one breath. This is called three-dimensional mobilization. Promoting military, political, economic, and cultural affairs simultaneously is called planar mobilization. Only by executing this vertically consistently and advancing horizontally simultaneously can we ensure the practical effect of public order.</p>
<p>Self-Improvement and Striving for Success</p>
<p>At this critical juncture, we must strive for self-improvement and strive for success. We cannot give up halfway. Success or failure depends on a change of mind. Use our own labor to determine our own destiny, to transform our own environment. Do not complain because we suffer, but endure the hardships that ordinary people cannot endure, and then we can achieve the great achievements that ordinary people cannot establish. We must aspire to be righteous people who sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others in the midst of storms, and not be inferior people who are "only for themselves" and "only for profit." There are many historical precedents in the world of people who are "only for profit" and "only for themselves" losing their motherland. Everyone should reflect on whether we have the psychology of being only for profit and only for ourselves, and whether we have the actions of being only for profit and only for ourselves. If so, we should painfully eliminate them. Confucius said: "The gentleman understands righteousness. The petty man understands profit." The distinction between righteousness and profit is not only a difference between gentlemen and petty men in virtue, but also the reason for the division between success and failure in career. The reality of "understanding righteousness" among our police and Baojia personnel is to implement police and Baojia liaison, to share a boat and serve the public, and to sacrifice for the public. Only those who are wholeheartedly serving will always be welcomed, and only those who are generously sacrificing can achieve a successful career and establish a good reputation.</p>
<p>Guarantee the Stability of Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>In terms of self-defense service, in maintaining public order, such as air defense, firefighting, first aid and other emergency work, and in suppressing chaos such as guarding, reporting, patrolling, blockading, and spot-checking households, in improving social welfare, such as cleaning streets, preventing epidemics and other sanitation work, assisting the elderly and weak, protecting women and infants, adjusting traffic order, and other construction and production work, based on the spirit of justice, loyalty, hard work, and mutual assistance, we will build a barrier of police and Baojia cooperation, establish a camp of police and Baojia unity, guarantee the permanent stability of Greater Shanghai, and strive for the final victory of Greater East Asia. The Corps Commander has boundless hopes for this. Now the personnel of the Corps Headquarters have been determined. The Director of the Municipal Police Department serves concurrently as the Corps Commander, and senior officials of the Municipal Police Department share the main responsibilities. Baojia personnel at all levels serve as captains and leaders of brigades, companies, and teams. The Corps Headquarters is located within the Municipal Police Department. All personnel under the Corps Commander will assume their duties immediately and begin using the official seal. It is hoped that police and Baojia personnel, as well as all citizens, will work together to plan and implement, and not give up their responsibility, based on the principle of "everyone for me, I for everyone," with the determination of "only planting and not asking for harvest," not seeking personal gain, but seeking the safety of the nation and the race, and doing something to save the local area and the country. I hope that everyone will work together to achieve this.</p>

<p>The Crime Prevention Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, recognizing the shortage of coal in Shanghai, which has led to restrictions on water and electricity usage, and to ensure a continuous supply for general residents, has seen an increasing number of people hiring experts to drill wells. To prevent any accidents from occurring, the department has drafted four key points for well drillers, requiring strict attention. These include: 1. After a well is drilled, a small sample of the well water should be sent to the Health Department for testing to determine its potability. 2. A well curb should be constructed from cement, sealed tightly to the ground to prevent dirty water and unclean liquids from entering. 3. A wooden fence, approximately three feet high, should be erected three feet from the outer perimeter of the well curb to prevent children from falling in. 4. The well opening must have a well cover slightly larger than the well curb, fitting snugly to prevent those weary of life from committing suicide by jumping into the well, and to prevent petty criminals from poisoning the water or throwing in filthy objects due to water shortages, leading to unfortunate incidents. The department hopes that citizens will diligently implement the above points.</p>

<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the authorities at the Goods Allocation Office regarding the extension of the rice distribution period for this period. The office provided the following details: "The office issued Public Notice No. 135 of the 'Pei Er' (Allocation Two) series on September 1st regarding the use of the 12th Comprehensive Allocation Certificate and the 43rd Rice Purchase Certificate. The original distribution period was set for September 2nd to 10th. However, due to continuous heavy rains in the city, water accumulation on the roads, and transportation difficulties, retailers were unable to deliver goods on schedule, and some citizens were unable to purchase rice due to the rain. To facilitate the public, the deadline is extended to the 13th. Citizens who have not yet purchased rice can still present their certificates at designated retailers or public distribution points. The allocation of rice for the next period remains at two 'shi sheng' per person, with no change in price, and is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month."</p>

<p>University Professor Symposium</p>
<p>Recognizing the declining effectiveness of general education in Shanghai in recent years, this newspaper is deeply concerned, along with other passionate education advocates. As the semester begins, a symposium was proposed to review and study improvement strategies. On the afternoon of September 4th, at 4:00 PM, the first university professor symposium was held at the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association. Attendees included Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Huang Jiade, Mr. Ying Huaigui, Mr. Zhang Youqin, Mr. Liu Hongdian, Mr. Zhang Bojun, Mr. You Qiwei, Mr. He Jialin, Mr. Tang Qingzeng, Ms. Lin Meishu, and Mr. Xu Zhengxu. Mr. Huang Jingwan, director of the social service department of this newspaper, presided over the meeting. The key points of the discussion are recorded below:</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: We are very pleased that professors from various universities have graciously attended today's symposium convened by our newspaper! Shen Bao has a long history of more than seventy years and has always represented the people, exerting its utmost efforts to promote justice. It has also focused on education and cultural undertakings, striving to express its views. At this critical time, in order to promote the normal development of education, we have initiated the convening of symposiums with education leaders from universities, middle schools, and primary schools, as well as symposiums with university students. These will be held sequentially this week. As leaders in the educational field, with your farsightedness, you will surely have insightful opinions to share. I will briefly raise several issues and humbly request your guidance.</p>
<p>First, Improving the Livelihood of Professors</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: The living conditions of the education sector are miserable. As far as I know, a certain university professor, who was a classmate of Hu Shi's during his studies in the United States, now has only thin porridge for three meals a day, and his children cannot afford to go to school. A certain university vice-president wears tattered clothes every day and carries a vegetable basket to the market to buy vegetables. He said that because he does not hire a nanny, and his wife is ill, he has to endure the hardship himself. Such a harsh life for professors is truly unfair!</p>
<p>Ying Huaigui: To improve the livelihood of university professors, the first step is to increase their salaries, and this requires increasing tuition fees. However, increasing tuition fees would increase the burden on students. So, in fact, there are difficulties on both sides. Speaking of the salaries of private universities next semester, the highest monthly salary is more than 30,000 yuan, which is much better than public universities. Our school, National Shanghai University, may look good on the outside, but the highest monthly salary is actually less than 10,000 yuan, which is much lower than private universities. No matter how much we increase the salaries of professors, with the soaring prices, we are still in a race between the tortoise and the hare. If this is the case for universities, the situation is even worse for primary and secondary schools. Recently, the authorities have proposed a special allocation, and I hope that there will be more allocations of food and daily necessities, which would be more effective.</p>
<p>Zhang Youqin: Mr. Ying's views are very correct. Distributing rice to teachers is the most necessary, and daily necessities are secondary. I hope your newspaper will advocate this more, and perhaps it will be possible to realize it.</p>
<p>Huang Jiade: The salaries of professors at St. John's University are similar to those of other private universities. Since tuition fees have always been relatively low, we have to live within our means. Next semester, we will moderately increase tuition fees, and the salaries of professors can be increased somewhat.</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun: The public funds allocated to national universities are never enough. The situation at our Shanghai Guiyuan College is believed to be similar to that of Shanghai University. Fortunately, our professors are all doctors, and they can supplement their income by practicing medicine in their spare time.</p>
<p>Tang Qingzeng: Most of the professors at Cheng Zheng College of Arts and Sciences also teach part-time, and their salaries are calculated by the hour, which is relatively meager.</p>
<p>Zhou Zefu: Huadong University is a collaboration between Zhijiang and Dongwu Universities, and the relationship is very harmonious. The salaries are still good. This semester, the tuition fees have been increased, and the increased tuition fees will be used to increase the salaries of teachers proportionally. If all schools can increase the salaries of teachers in proportion to the increase in tuition fees, then the salaries of teachers can naturally be improved. We hope that the authorities of each school will implement this conscientiously. Only then would that be fair.</p>
<p>Lin Meishu: It is best for university professors to have a unified organization to strive for their own interests, and then their livelihoods can be improved.</p>
<p>Zhou Zefu: Summarizing everyone's opinions: 1. Please, Shen Bao, do your best to advocate for special allocations of rice and daily necessities to the education sector. 2. The authorities of each school should be transparent about their finances and increase the salaries of teachers in proportion to the increased tuition fees.</p>
<p>Second, Review of Scholarship Programs</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: This year, Shen Bao is managing the continuation of the scholarship fund, and one thing that is most difficult is that the tuition fees have increased, making it difficult to allocate the funds. Fortunately, there are many kind people in Shanghai who are willing to donate, so we can still manage. This year, we emphasize the four factors of students' physical fitness, academic performance, family circumstances, and character when considering applications. We are grateful for the great assistance from all levels of schools. What are your insights on this? Please enlighten us.</p>
<p>Liu Hongdian: Your newspaper's management of the scholarship fund has been very effective. Since there are more monks than porridge, you should focus on students who are studying specialized scientific subjects. In the future, national rejuvenation and construction will require scientific talent, and the career prospects for those who study science are also broad.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Our newspaper has already paid attention to this. According to the statistics of the students approved this year, in the university group, about 70% to 80% are studying practical subjects, while those studying liberal arts and law account for an absolute minority.</p>
<p>Qing Qingzeng: Your newspaper can adopt an examination format, holding a qualifying examination for university students studying practical subjects to identify and reward those with true talent and learning, which would be very meaningful.</p>
<p>Huang Jiade: St. John's University also has a scholarship fund, but it is a small-scale experiment.</p>
<p>He Jialin: The board of directors and alumni of Nantong College have also established a scholarship fund. While investigating the students' family situations, we hope that all universities can take the initiative to do so, making it a trend, and the results will be significant.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: Summarizing everyone's opinions: 1. Scholarship funds should be used to support science students. 2. Implement qualifying examinations to select true talents.</p>
<p>The Issue of Practical Training in Science and Engineering</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: After the war, the school buildings of various universities in Shanghai have been relocated, and there is a lack of laboratories. What students learn is just theoretical knowledge, without practical experience. What are your insights?</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun: Students studying science and engineering cannot do without laboratories. It is best for each school to borrow from each other to share resources. However, it is not easy to purchase all experimental materials. If they are borrowed from each other, strict management must be ensured. Otherwise, if one only cares about oneself and not others, it will also be detrimental.</p>
<p>Zhang Youqin: If there is no practical experience in science and engineering, what is learned will be useless. Of course, each school hopes to have complete laboratories, but there is a lack of equipment and suitable locations. It is best to ask Shen Bao to initiate the establishment of a central laboratory. Shen Bao should raise funds from all sectors for the land, buildings, and expenses, while each school would provide its own materials and medicines. There should be professionals in charge of guiding and conducting practical research. This is closely related to the industrial and commercial sectors, so why not actively promote it to make it a reality?</p>
<p>Liu Hongdian: This plan is very meaningful. Shanghai is such a large place, with all kinds of wasteful spending everywhere. Who would not support promoting science? Please, Shen Bao, take the lead.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: I am afraid it will not be easy at present, but Shen Bao will do its best.</p>
<p>Fourth, University Student Readers and Reference Books</p>
<p>Question</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: After the war, there was a shortage of materials, which affected university students' books. New books from overseas do not arrive, and cultural exchanges are hindered. What are your opinions?</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun: There are now borrowing methods, or mutual exchanges, which are also unavoidable methods. Shanghai Medical College has established three methods of buying, borrowing, and renting, but it is limited to one school, the scale is small, and it is easy to manage. New books are not easy to buy, but old books can be used. Each school can handle it on its own, and renting books can be implemented.</p>
<p>Ying Huaigui: Your newspaper is enthusiastic about social services. Can you imitate the borrowing method and expand the scale to rent reference books for various universities? However, it requires considerable funding and manpower.</p>
<p>Zhang Bojun: It is best to ask public and private libraries to handle it, which is more appropriate. Specify which reference books, borrow and read according to the rules, so as not to be lost.</p>
<p>Zhou Zefu: Please, Shen Bao, consult with libraries in each central location, and persuade people from all walks of life to donate books or money, to provide for university students who have no books to read, which can be considered an active act of kindness.</p>
<p>At this point in the symposium, the bell rang seven times, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e33">"Silver Sea Millennium" Unprecedented Grandeur - Three Charity Performances Continue Today <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The new epic film "Silver Sea Millennium" produced by China Film Company was released yesterday at the Grand Theater, with full houses for all three showings. The audience's emotions were very enthusiastic, and their interest was particularly strong! The main reasons are: first, the story of this film is colorful, the visuals are beautiful, novel and majestic, and all have reached perfection; second, the director's handling of the film is an improvement over the original; third, the total number of male and female stars participating in the performance is over a thousand. The true faces of Lushan are all taken into view. The twenty-six big stars, whether deceased, traveling thousands of miles away, or leaving the film industry, all gathered together, singing loudly with round and jade-like voices, intoxicating the audience! Such a large-scale star gathering can only be seen a few times in a lifetime? No wonder moviegoers were very happy after watching it!</p>
<p>Yesterday and today, "Silver Sea Millennium" will be performing for the charity fundraising of Shen Xin Two Newspapers for scholarships and vagrants. With the enthusiastic support of the industry and commerce, the sale of the bonds is very busy. Yesterday, people who went to the Shen Bao Social Service Department to contact the purchase and sending of money were swarmed, and more than two million yuan has been collected in two days. This kind of spirit of "doing what is right" can be said to be the virtue of "not letting the gentleman give way." We respectfully bow to the students and displaced vagrants who will receive the assistance of the two newspapers.</p>
<p>Today there will be three more performances at 2:30 PM, 5:15 PM, and 8:00 PM. In addition to the two newspapers being responsible for the promotion and sales of various bonds, the Grand Theater also has ticket sales. It is hoped that women from all walks of life will go together to watch. Although there are air raid drills, the time does not conflict. You can sit quietly and enjoy the feast for the eyes. On this year's August 1st Rejuvenation Festival, the Municipal Propaganda Office will jointly organize various celebrations with relevant agencies. The proceeds from some of the artistic programs will be used for the Mayor's Scholarship Fund, in addition to the necessary expenses, and entrusted to this newspaper for management. In addition to the 207,000 yuan in proceeds from the swimming performance sent by the Municipal Health Bureau, which has been designated to subsidize students studying chemical sciences and medicine, five students each in medicine and chemistry will be selected. Yesterday, the Municipal Propaganda Office sent a total of 303,994.62 yuan from the Chinese Film Company's Jinle Concert and the Peking Opera Association's Peking Opera Gathering, and designated them to subsidize poor students studying literature and art. We will select the best students for promotion and further publication later, and we express our gratitude first.</p>
