<h3>鄉村建設工作之現在與將來</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>——鄒敬芳氏訪問記——</p>
<p>實施鄉村建設工作，以謀民生安定，而期增加生產。現値協力大東亞戰爭之際，固爲當務之急，即將來決勝完成以後，亦屬不可稍緩，此則無人能加以否認者。記者月來巡禮和平區內數十農村，見多數農村經濟破產情形日趨尖說化，大多數農民難免呻吟於困苦之中。此種現象，在戰爭期間之各國家固難倖免，尤其在我國情形特殊。此時間此環境而言鄉村建設，實屬艱鉅工作。國民政府本年設立鄉村建設實施委員會肩此重任，至堪期待。記者爲明瞭該會工作推進情形，特訪問該會委員長鄒敬芳氏作以下之談話。</p>
<p>敎授風度</p>
<p>鄒敬芳氏湖南人，的四十餘歲，畢業於日本早稻田大學政治經濟系，事變前曾在廣州中山大維執敎數年。經記者說明來意。鄒氏即謂實施鄉建工作，先以實騐縣區爲對象，以後再推行於全國。本年內實施工作計分（一）組訓民衆，（二）整編團警，（三）淸　賦稅，（四）振興農事，（五）興修水利，（六）督導副業，（七）勵行巡迴敎育，（八）補充空通工作等八項綱要。此八項工作綱要，決定督飭各實騐縣區，在本年內必須辦理具有規模。以便明年度繼續推行第二期勵行村洛自治，强化民衆組織，確保地方治安，勵行農業改進，推進育苗造林，興修水利道路，籌設農業金庫，評定農產價格，督導農村副業，擴充鄉村敎育，改良民衆衛生，勵行戒絕烟賭娼等十二項工作綱要。說到這裏，記者說明最近曾到過某幾個實騐縣區，情形不盡相同，工作綱要，若果嚴的硬性規定，將來各縣實施時，不至於　枘難行吧？鄒氏答稱本人亦見到此層外，打算不派其他人員駐在各實騐縣區，從談話裏可以　出鄒氏不失爲一坦白而實事求是的官員吧。</p>
<p>實幹主義與機構的一元化</p>
<p>記者復談到在各鄉村所見所聞的人民痛古純費，竟超出千萬元以上，此種不合理的情形，人民當然免不了許多痛苦。現正督飭該縣編造預算，另謀正當的挹注辦法，以期減輕人民擔負。他縣有類是者，亦當照此辦理。鄒氏復謂本人作事，素來抱實幹主義，絕不好高驚遠，故已決定授權各實騐縣縣長分別緩急，　定章則，次第興辦，由委員會隨時督導，嚴加考核，絕不容有推諉及因循之事發生。本人以後當隨時前往各　騐縣區查看。鄒氏復帶笑說，除了必要之技術人員以情形，不無勢在倒懸亟待拯救之感。鄒氏亦點首表示同感，現在鄉村中一般人民的痛苦，早已稔知。就以江寗實驗縣區來說吧，全縣人口不過六十萬人，係連老弱婦女一併計算在內，而該縣每月所担任各項，尤其深知鄉村建設工作，必須深入底層，實事求是，方能奏效，絕不是僅靠在都市內開幾次會所能解決，對於一切正當輿論★極願接受。因談到開會，鄒氏復提及上次舉行實騐縣政會議情形，謂縣長到會者僅有富塗江寗崑山三縣，聽取他們報告，見面不過數次，但他們各個個性以及能力如何則已了然，並謂以後當如何分別督導以全事功。這三個縣區，記者最近均已到過，成績如何均曾目覩，對於各縣長個性如何，與鄒氏所說若合符節。鄒氏此種愛惜人材及與人爲養之至意，良足稱這。想這三位縣長總要奮發有爲勉副鄒氏的期望吧。記者提到行政院另有農業增產策進委員會和合作事業委員會的設立，這兩個機構與鄉建工作均有密切關係，實施工作時是不是有疊床架屋或竟事倍功半之嫌呢？鄒氏思索須臾說道，當時這三個機構相繼分別設立，實有其特殊原因。在施政上便利起見，似有一元化之必要，將來政府或將加以調整的。</p>
<p>平抑物價的根本問題</p>
<p>因爲鄒氏兼任全國經濟委員會秘書長，記者即以目前嚴重之物價問題相詢。鄒氏說，戰時物價較平時高騰，自屬必然之勢，惟在我國情形特殊，內在的困難很多，以致演成萬分嚴重之局。本人深覺欲根本解決物價問題，除積極增加生產以外別無他途。欲謀增加生產，必須物資交流得臻圓滑，動力供給調整適宜方能奏效。在政府方面立塲，自應從根本上着手，推動各方，獲得協助，以謀澈底的解決，假如鄉村建設工作能成功達到某一階段，物價問題，未始不能附帶解決。所以本人嘗謂國民政府之前途，寄於鄉建工作成功與吾，不僅物價一問題也。（寄自南京）</p>
<h3>松村報道部長演講「雷伊泰制勝者」　唯有特別攻撃隊之凜冽精神</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大本營陸軍報道部長松村，九日晚七時報告新聞後，作廣播講演，題爲「雷伊泰制勝者」，詳細講述雷伊泰戰局之推移，謂制勝唯有以特別攻擊隊之凛烈精神，其大意如决：大東亞戰爭勃發以來，已滿三年，由太平洋廣大之戰域及敵美所持之物量觀之，此次戰爭決不能短期結束，人類有史以來之大戰，開始應由戰局全面觀之，似雷伊泰之決戰，乃太平洋戰爭之最大者，亦今後戰爭影響最大者，自十月下旬開始以來，今愈趨加甚，上月間敵以優勢戰車由塔克羅，塔拉克上陸，日方已予以阻止，今猶以突擊隊使敵寒阻。至十一月，敵軍一部在北方卡里加拉進攻馬那嘎斯那斯附近，在南方進抵奧爾莫克灣東岸之巴帕附近，與日軍新銳部隊展開激鬥。海中有菲律賓之海戰，空中有日軍航空部隊述日猛攻，特別攻擊隊之出動，已予敵軍艦船飛行塲以重大打擊。自十一月初以來三週間，馬那嘎斯那斯及里蒙方面，最爲激烈，至十二月初旬，頓呈膠着狀態，無大變化，敵軍之奪回菲律賓，已與預料相反。在雷伊泰之惡戰，敵美所期待者爲何，乃在以美軍工兵隊。整備雷伊泰灣，以P38型，B24型戰鬬轟炸機及呂宋東方海面之機動部隊切斷日軍之補給路，然其期待果能實現乎。雷伊泰與所羅門，馬利亞納不同，彼等雖百般妨害，日軍仍能自菲律賓中部山嶺間繼續補給，至是彼等所準備之機塲如塔克羅班，塔拉克，聖巴布羅，布羅音等處侵入一星期後，即開始使用。十一月中旬以戰鬥機爲主體者有三百架內外，十一月下旬遭日空挺隊之轟炸，十二月經高千穗降下隊之襲擊及地上部隊之挺身衝鋒，相繼而至，致布羅音南北機塲及聖巴布羅機塲不復使用，基地之航空勢力亦顯著減少。摩羅泰島方面，日陸上空軍之轟炸態勢已愈趨增强，敵機塲雖經建設六處，至今所殘留而可使用者，不過二處而已，今者，雷伊泰敵王要航空基地布羅音附近陸上戰鬥，日方逐漸進入有利，故敵方無論如何，急欲打開此難境。十二月七日，敵約一個師團之部隊，於奧爾莫（克灣東岸阿爾別拉附近登陸，日航空部隊當即對此予以猛烈轟炸，陸上部隊亦加以襲擊，現正展開激戰中。是以雷伊泰之戰鬥，近三日來之膠着狀態，已顯現活躍，吾人應知現戰局之眞象，須排除一切苦艱，而向勝利邁進。雷伊泰戰爭靈爲一億國民之氣魄與特攻隊相速繫者，其悲壯之鬬魂，即大和魂，此種魂魄浸透各職業界時，則雷伊泰之勝利，自亦可到來也。</p>

<h3>戰爭三週年之感想　——松平情報部長廣播演辭——</h3>
<p>日駐華大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，昨晚七時二十分在上海電台廣播演說，題爲「戰爭三週年之感想」其詞如下：</p>
<p>東西洋人之差異</p>
<p>知己知彼，乃戰勝之先決條件，戰塲之算術自不待言，即無論賭一國運命之宣戰佈告，或平時外交戰之折衝樽組，均非將對方情勢有以凖確把握量度自己之實力，而下以正當之判斷不可，蓋戰爭之勝敗，須視判斷之正當與吾，決非過甚其詞。但此種判斷，因加以判斷者之觀察頗相逕庭，故當時亦有不凖確者。大概吾們日本人與英美人之不同，所謂作爲判斷基礎物之見解，或所謂思索之態度，總之，無論所見所聞以及思考均大相逕庭。若問日本人與英美人究有何處不同，任何人均立即答以人種之不同，蓋顏色各異或鼻官特佳，總之，連想及外貌之不同，但除所言者觀之外，然則何處所謂不伺，殊難回答。若問並非外貌，而內容之不同究竟如何，殊難窮究其極。</p>
<p>觀察事物見解不同　雖然此種相異結果，祗是見解不同。蓋日本人僅以日本式觀測事物，而英美人則以英美派觀測事物，換言之，即日本人比較多無念無想，因之以直感活動，以直感觀察事物加以直感之判斷時爲多，此爲日本人與英美人最不同處。反之，英美人之思想，則並非無念無想，係以分析的詮索的觀測事物而加以判斷，彼等之直感，並非遲鈍之活動，此爲英美人之特徵。日本式之觀察法，爲所謂東洋式之觀測法，而中國人，印度人，以及南方各民族，均同樣具有此項特徵。英美人派之觀測法，即所謂西洋之觀察法，歐洲人全部均有共通之特徵與見解。對於此東洋式之觀察法，最爲澈底者，當爲中國人，大槪以直感進行，中國有所謂取天下·天下太平，天之下皆爲國家，到處不設立境界綫，或區劃之詞，若採取分析或統計，則誠不大高明。例如其人口或稱四萬萬，或稱四萬萬五千萬，大概以估計算定，此所以當華盛頓會議之時，法國代表白里安曾提出質問，謂「中國究爲如何之國？」總之，對於中國若以西洋派加以觀察，誠難瞭解，所以有此種愚笨之質問發生。</p>
<p>英美人之日本觀</p>
<p>然即英美人對於日本如何加以觀察，如一般得識階級之見解，在太平洋之沿海岸，中國大陸之東有一小島國，居住該處之人有猿猴之智慧，富模倣性，且爲好戰侵略之人，但在此小島國之日本人，擁有相當之武力，被列入世界一等國之內，雖有時口出傲慢不遜，但對於英美作戰者洵爲笨伯，所謂不可思議之國，不可思議之人種，此種見解尚稱客氣者。至於普通之庶民，則全不知有所謂日本，大槪中等學校之歷史敎科書中，做約有一頁半叙述日本之事。余之友人某日本畫家，曾直接聞此畫家所言，謂曾在外國儼一模特兒，在勤習繪畫中漸與此模特兒感情日佳，屢屢同出飮茶或　往進食，竭力引其歡心，但某一娩上同往觀電影，畫面上映出菲洲土人之「祭頭」，及草裙舞之塲面，坐在旁邊觀劇之模特兒，以口附其耳際，囁嚅稱，「汝國之塲面已經映出，亦懷念吾？」畫家聞斯言，心中至爲憤慨，且不容加以反駁，對於此模特兒之熱情，亦完全冷淡矣。以上所指之外國，大槪在法國，此種情形，無論英國人或美國人，大致均相同，一般庶民均不出此模特兒見解之範圍。若謂英美之政治家及軍人首腦部，如何觀察日本，則依然以分析的詮索的種種統計與數學加以觀察，計算日本之面積及資源，由日本之國力幾何，以比較英美國內幾分之一。因之謂戰爭爲三個月之形勢，此爲三年前彼等之觀測，一般無智之庶民均予相信。</p>
<p>對日估計完全錯誤　在華盛頓十餘年服務彼處圖書館之坂西女史曾稱，當乘交換船歸返時，美國友人曾予特別無惡意之忠告，頗多謂「若經三個月，則戰爭即可結束，汝毋須乘交換船返國，不如留居華盛頓」。如此種見解謂日本毫無爲力，當時美國之日本觀，可謂完全錯誤，此何以故，蓋彼等判斷之基礎，專持皮相之數字與統計，僅見日本之物量而不將精神方面計算在內，此恐爲其主要之原因。但精神力以數字計算在內，此恐爲其主要之原因。但精神力以數字與統計表示加以計算者，爲不可能之事，錯誤判斷所招致之結果，美國之當初判斷業已崩潰，此於吾人可謂幸事。然敵人於此重新檢討日本國力以謀對抗，遂着手補給鹿大戰力，截至現在爲止，曾消耗二千億美元未曾有之軍事費，急速增强飛機體船戰車大小砲載重汽車及其他軍需品之生產，此最初三個月結束戰爭之觀察，已拋諸九霄雲外，於是遂將和平產業換爲軍需產業，故不得不極度壓制民需，結果三年後之今日，國民生活日益低下，社會不安亦意外發生，誇稱物量之敵美，其軍需品之生產亦速低降。（待續）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>注視物價猖獗</h3>
<p>前天本市機濟保安處召集各業同業公會理事長，舉行懇談會，其目的在於今後各業公會應與經濟保安處取得密切聯絡與協力，各公會應嚴令各會員商號，在未核准提高限價前，不得擅自漲價。各公會對於會員不正當行爲，不正規營業，于以檢舉，俾可嚴格取締。在此物價猖獗聲中，我們希望各公會負責人充分認識淸　，合作協力。</p>
<p>物價問題，近數年來，無時不在波動之中，即波動的時間也愈趨愈短了。譬如去年中每次物價波動，相隔半年或數月一次，在這個期間，尚能靜止一時，而每次波動，還有一個刺激的主導原因。今年以至最近的情形，每次波動相隔一月或一周，甚至每日波動，而刺激波動也無所謂主導原因，這種現象，可從最近幾天中充分看到，無論日用品，米柴菜蔬，車資等等，無不今與昨異，一日三市。</p>
<p>爲什麽造成這種現象呢？我們認爲，最簡單的原因，就是一般商人－－擴大一點說，物賢執有者－－對於所有物的售價，抱定彼此觀望，你北我也漲，你跌我不跌，於是大家只漲不跌。而一般市民對於重物資輕貨幣的心理，愈趨愈烈，故於每次波動之際，偏偏爭先購存，商人更因此視爲漲價的機會。</p>
<p>以上所說的，都是年來物價趨漲的實際現象。至於物價問題在理論上的　結，當然由於物資的短缺，通貨的增發，運輸的阻滯，可是，這些都是戰時經濟不可絕對避免的。然而，我們始終認爲這些雖則是不可絕對避免，但是不能說沒有相當的限度。可是，目前的物價趨漲的實際現象，已經超過了這些理論上的限度了。換句話說，物資短缺，通貨增發，運輸減低的倍數，與物價實際高漲的倍數，早已不是平行了。</p>
<p>然則爲什麼物價高漲如此猖獗呢？綜括一言，由於政治不良。因爲政治不良，管理物價的繼構紛歧，法令不一，人事不臧，在全部機構法令人事的不嚴密中，縱有一二機構法令人事稍有精神，也難於挽回整個不良現象了。政治的良窳，當然是人爲的。所以，物價猖獗現象的形成，也是人爲的。譬如最近的黃金暴漲，是毫無理由的，是可以避免的，而完全是人爲的投機造謠所致，可惜當局坐視猖獗，不能直搗投機份子而嚴予取締。過去各業投機猖獗的實例頗多，這次不過其中的一例而已。且看盟邦日本對於戰時不可絕對避免的經濟現象，也同樣存在的，但是物價始終穩定，投機份子無法逞惡，這是政治良好的實證。</p>
<p>我們對於本市經濟保安處的成立，以及五島處長以决各高級幹部的忠於職守，自始表示欣幸。不過，經濟保安處僅是管理物價機構中的一環，諺云：「獨木艱支大厦」，我們盼望經濟保安處今後更應重視物價波動的原因，充分運用本身權職，對於投機分子，嚴查取締，同時，更盼望物價管理機構與人事，全面整飭，切實負起責任。投機暴利，物價猖獗，民生威脅，危機隱伏，有關當局更不能不密切注意。</p>

<p>滬市金融工商各業市況，上週間仍在人心忐忑不定中盤旋上升，　以投機市儈從中煽動，　吸之風，　續演進，回疲之勢殊不易展開。金融方面，　赤步高，購進頗佔多數，業外人購求甚感無門可入，紋銀連漲三天，高起五十元，錢業拆息掛牌未更，但暗西提高，情勢似絞絞　，因急需資金者不惜加高借息。華股週一週二尚稱平穩，週三週四週五因市場不利　頭，留言濃厚。多頭吹收頗股，故連漲三天，週六上半市始見稍平，蓋多方停手吹收，人心轉疲。工商方面，因各業工廠均受斷電影響，無法繼續開工，生產困難，雖有改用引擎消息，但俙初步準備。何時恢復原有工業生產，尚難預料，故有開工業物資漲勢均未見平戰。其他日用食品米·油·柴·雜糧等市價，均在暗中挺漲。此種情形實屬威脅民生，日感不安，故一般社會人士，莫不希望有關政府當局，迅謀澈底有效之對策。勿使投機市儈或囤戶有變相活動餘地。則俙市民之幸。</p>

<p>（一）督導各地增產工作之實施機關，應與經濟局及其他有關機關今後切實連緊。</p>
<p>（二）本市所轄之農場及各改進區之技術人員，與合作社所屬分支社之生產互助社，及鄉鎮協進負責人員，應隨時予以學術及精神之訓練。</p>
<p>（三）各地應依照當地之環境氣候土質就單位面積產量最高之農作物予以提倡及獎勵種植，不必固守習慣及風尚之所趨，尤應注意輪作，以維地力。</p>

<p>（五）中堅農民之訓練及農民講習會，應利用農閑，普遍舉行之，授以農業常識。</p>
<p>（六）明年應勵行春耕，施行合式秧田獎勵捕卵殺螟之工作，使勿再釀本年螟虫之災。</p>
<p>（七）自戰事發生後，化學肥料來源缺乏，且農民對於化學肥料之使用，認識不清，應提倡及指導農民利用。</p>
<p>（八）鄉間農民窮困已極，應由經濟局各合作社負責，由中日及銀行貸款低利貸，與生產農民。</p>
<p>（九）各地農場及合作社農場，除作示範動作外，亦應注意試驗研究工作。</p>
<p>（十）本市及所屬各縣份及鐵路沿綫休閒荒地，指定農民墾殖或招收本市失業遊民，由政府撥一部費用，成立墾殖局，負責管理。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點二十分</p>
<h3>蘇崑虞產米區視察記（五）</h3>
<p>蘇州合作社，資金三萬萬元，其中三千萬元爲社員會費，收買農作物爲米，麥，豆，棉花，菜籽，菎麻等六種，目前該社爲適應目前情勢，從消費性質之配給而置重點於積極性的生產方面。</p>
<p>崑山合作社支社，關於收買米糧工作，是擔任第二區共五鄉，該社擁有社員一五·〇四二人，其中付會費者（每年一百元）計八·六一四人，訓練農民幹部的互助社八〇所，計社員六九五一人。收買食米時，除付現款外，並對於配給，其辦法：一·農民賣出白米一石，配給白布五碼，價六〇〇元（黑市两千元）豆餅三塊，每塊一百五十元。二·賣出白米兩石，配給黑布五碼二五，價六〇〇元（黑市兩千七百元）豆餅　塊。三·卖出白米三石，配给漂白布五碼二五，價六〇〇元（黑市二千五百元），豆饼七塊。四·賣出白米五石，配給斜文布五碼二五，價六〇〇元（黑市三千六百元）豆餅八塊。</p>
<p>合作社所以能夠對收買米糧工作，獲得極好的成績，原因有以後的幾點</p>
<p>一·合作社是能夠直接接觸農民，把握民心，米商則與農民間，尚有經紀人等，未免隔膜。</p>
<p>二·合作社收買價格，絕對公正，交付農民，米商及經紀人，其間或有從中剝削農民，以獲利潤</p>
<p>三·合作社對於農民愛護是全年的，米商及經紀人僅收米時期與農民接觸，過後，就不顧農民的福利。</p>
<p>合作社既有如此優點，希望國府熱衷於農村建設諸公，不必成立類如農村增產等等組織，以致機關林立，力量反而分散，還不如集中全力於強化合作社機構，俾能普遍於農村間，同時，對於收買農作物工作，今後可不必經過中間人（如米商經紀人）之手，直接由合作社負担此項重責。</p>
<p>七　農民生活問題</p>
<p>記者　於視察旅程，無時無刻無不以農民生活狀況爲念，於其聽聞長篇大論的理論演講，反不若與農民直接娓娓而談，更具實性。</p>
<p>據各處農民所談，歸納其要點，大要爲以後數端：</p>
<p>一·蘇州地區，田主擁田七〇％，自耕農僅佔三〇％。</p>
<p>二·蘇省各地農民耕種，有六〇％缺乏資金，向田主或其他人等借高利貸，利息達二〇％。</p>
<p>三·目前蘇省農民種田之成本，飛躍增加，假如以處第二區論，每畝田除田租田賦外，更需肥料，每畝需豆餅五只，計價二千元，同時負擔地方雜捐每畝每月六〇元。</p>
<p>四·處縣幾區農民，所儲米糧，於秋季收穫后，維持至明面二·三月間，業已告罄，依賴小熟（小麥·元麥·大麥）所獲爲生，所食者爲「　湯」（即麥粞）；有甚至終年食麥粞，再以崑山蓬　鎮附近鄉間，多售出食米，運往　浦轉向上海，以致農民所吃的，爲薄粥和鍋巴湯而已。</p>
<p>五·鄉保甲長的人選問題，農民極表關切，因爲此等中間份子，不免有中飽等情，例如常熟農民，於去年賣出食米時，米統會發出白券，藍券，紅券的配給物資證，（每券可得棉布，肥皂，火柴，白糖，香烟）结果农民祗得布一尺半，眼看鄉保長每人挾棉布數匹，肥皂等多量，忍聲吞氣，因彼等具有地方土勢力，不敢告發。</p>
<p>對於目前農民生活狀況如是，在日本，農夫具有無限自尊心，如號稱日本的丹麥的碧海郡農村裏青年，必要在名片上印上農夫某某的一種氣慨，在中國的農民，卻可憐的成爲苛稅的對象，現農民既爲後方的生產戰士，當局應以敬愛尊重的態度，對待農民，檢舉不良的鄉·保甲·予農民以保障，同時，不要於收買米糧時才想及農民，重農的政策，不是暫時的，應該長久的，在全年隨時隨地予農民以澈底的保護，予農民以熱忱的協力。</p>
<p>八　貪官污吏問題</p>
<p>朝無貪官污吏，野無奸商市儈，則民眾生活，當爲明朗，自今春后胡事件，賴當局斷然處置，民衆無不痛快，此種腐化份子，使農民所受苦痛極大。</p>
<p>記者關於蘇州開座談會時，本國幹事竹本氏（大陸新報）即　就目睹的事實，舉出一貪污官吏的實例，以證明此等人物之荒淫與無恥。</p>
<p>同時提出以下方法，以求澈底　清類如螟蟲之份子。</p>
<p>一，安定官吏生法。</p>
<p>二，於各處設立嚴正法庭，偵查官吏之有貪污行爲者，予以澈底懲罰。</p>
<p>三，利用各地合作社機構，實行農民配給，收買，以減少貪官污吏利用之機會。</p>
<p>四，盼望當局對貪官污吏問題，予新聞界以絕對自由，澈底檢舉，以消滅借美名以騙農民之份子。</p>
<p>期待於上海各界</p>
<p>記者關於抵達蘇州後，曾敬　江蘇省聯絡部長金子大佐，金子氏精神煥發，對上海方面，提出兩點，以促注意：</p>
<p>一，上海爲中國經濟中心。希望能動員全市金融界，於業務上協助　辦食米工作，將資金流入農村，舉辦農貸工作。</p>
<p>二，上海的戶口配給制，必求絕對正確，例如一區配給戶口米計八〇人，實際上人口僅七〇人，這一點，務須改正。</p>
<p>金子大佐於記者談話中，主張重點主義的配給制；凡是有貢獻於社會，國家戰爭的，增加配給；否則則減少配給量。</p>
<p>記者關於視察時期，固時時以上海民食問題爲念，於軍官及收買關係者詢問時，無不以上海民食實情報告，以供彼等參考，於視察完畢返　後，願以見聞所及，與上海各界商討者：</p>
<p>一，本市金融工商各界，或有利用其資金於投機囤積之用途，對於農村貸款，漠不關心，以致百分之六十二農民　，深受高利貸之痛苦，希望能幡然覺悟，將資金流入農村間，普設農貸所，以減輕農民之負擔。</p>
<p>二，希望市民，處處以大乘着想，目光放遠，同時對於浪費米糧之釀酒（其中尤以白酒耗資費址極大），造　糖等工業，應立即停止製造！</p>
<p>三，爲節省米糧起見，希望市民儘量搭食雜糧。</p>
<p>末了記者　以一則見告市民，聞市政府容納市政諮詢委會之建議，實業界之後援，將發行上海市公債，總額爲十五萬萬元，預定以十萬萬元作爲調整米糧資金而用以調整配給米價格；以維持每石五千元之價格爲標準，以保障市民之民食，大致此種臨時救濟庫券，至　　明年一月一日以前發行，對此，記者　願以熱忱期待。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>總理遣訓會　沒有農民的協助，革命是不能成功的，所以農民是國家的原動力，記者　視察結果，深感農民之責務崇高而偉大，而其目前處境，又極爲困苦，願以赤子之　，呼　於當局，希望當局能傾注全力，剔除妨礙農民民生之不良份子，取締一切對農民苛斂許求行爲，惟有愛護農民，保護農民，　能使生產增加，社會國家得以生存，戰爭之勝利，亦惟是賴。（完）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Underway on the West Coast of Leyte: Enemy Airfields Enveloped in Flames</h3>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the enemy's counterattack from the Damulaan area failed, they attacked the coast about 10.5 kilometers south of Alvera on the west coast of Leyte on the 6th with landing ships. However, they were bombarded by the Japanese garrison in the area, and part of them sank immediately. Four amphibious tanks that forcibly landed under the cover of Japanese artillery fire were also destroyed by the Japanese. Suffering heavy losses, the enemy ceased landing and fled in disarray. On the 7th, the enemy attacked again with many destroyers, transport ships, and landing craft, and forcibly landed under the cover of naval gun fire. The Japanese garrison immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy fleet, causing most of it to collapse and flee. At that time, some enemy troops took the opportunity to land on the nearby coast. The Japanese army, with the cooperation of the Air Force, launched a fierce attack, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting. Enemy ships also invaded Ormoc Bay, attempting to land, but were heavily bombed by the Japanese Air Force and suffered heavy losses. At the same time, near Alvera, one enemy large transport ship was destroyed, one enemy transport ship was sunk at Bapa, and one destroyer was destroyed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison west of Tagami, from the night of the 5th to noon on the 6th, air-raided the area near the north and south Broon airfields, suddenly entering the north airfield and completely occupying it. At the same time, dozens of enemy aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed by bombing, five bombers caught fire and burned, and other enemy aircraft were destroyed because they had no time to take off. The enemy airfield and all facilities fell into the hands of the Japanese army. Although the enemy struggled to resist, they failed due to the fierce Japanese attack. Also, the south Broon airfield and the San Pablo airfield are now surrounded by flames. The enemy's 7th Division, 9th, and 11th Divisions lost all will to fight due to the Japanese army's surprise attack, so the entire enemy line in that area is becoming increasingly shaken. In addition, the first unit that forcibly landed near the Broon airfield on the 26th of last month also participated in the battle and achieved great results.</p>

<h3>The Present and Future of Rural Construction Work</h3>
<p>– Min Xian</p>
<p>—— An Interview with Mr. Zou Jingfang ——</p>
<p>Implementing rural construction work to ensure people's livelihood and increase production is an urgent task during the current cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a task that cannot be delayed after the final victory is achieved. No one can deny this. Over the past month, I have toured dozens of villages in the peaceful areas and have seen that the economic bankruptcy of most villages is becoming increasingly acute, and most farmers cannot avoid groaning in hardship. This phenomenon is difficult to avoid in various countries during wartime, especially in our country where the situation is unique. Speaking of rural construction at this time and in this environment is a difficult task. The establishment of the Rural Construction Implementation Committee by the National Government this year shoulders this heavy responsibility and is worthy of anticipation. To understand the progress of the association's work, I interviewed Mr. Zou Jingfang, the chairman of the association, and had the following conversation.</p>
<p>Professor's Demeanor</p>
<p>Mr. Zou Jingfang is from Hunan Province, in his forties, and graduated from the Department of Political Economy of Waseda University in Japan. Before the incident, he taught at Guangzhou Zhongshan University for several years. After I explained the purpose of my visit, Mr. Zou immediately said that the implementation of rural construction work should first target experimental counties and districts, and then be promoted throughout the country. The implementation work this year is divided into eight main points: (1) organizing and training the people, (2) reorganizing the group police, (3) clarifying taxes, (4) revitalizing agriculture, (5) building water conservancy, (6) supervising side occupations, (7) practicing circuit education, and (8) supplementing air transport work. It has been decided that these eight main points must be implemented on a scale in each experimental county district within this year in order to continue to promote the second phase of village autonomy, strengthen people's organizations, ensure local security, implement agricultural improvement, promote seedling cultivation and afforestation, build water conservancy roads, establish agricultural banks, assess agricultural product prices, supervise rural side occupations, expand rural education, improve people's hygiene, and implement abstinence from smoking, gambling, and prostitution. Speaking of this, I explained that I had recently visited several experimental counties and districts, and the situations were not the same. If the work outline is strictly and rigidly stipulated, will it not be difficult to implement in the various counties in the future? Mr. Zou replied that he had also seen this level and planned not to send other personnel to reside in the experimental counties and districts. From the conversation, it can be seen that Mr. Zou is a frank and pragmatic official.</p>
<p>Pragmatism and Unification of Institutions</p>
<p>I also mentioned that the people's pain and suffering seen and heard in the various villages cost more than 10 million yuan, and that the people inevitably suffered a lot from this unreasonable situation. He is currently supervising the county to prepare a budget and seek other legitimate ways to provide funds in order to reduce the burden on the people. Other counties with similar situations should also be handled in this way. Mr. Zou also said that he has always held a pragmatic attitude in doing things and never aims too high. Therefore, he has decided to authorize the county heads of the experimental counties to determine the urgency and formulate regulations to carry out the work step by step, with the committee supervising and rigorously assessing the work at any time, and absolutely not allowing any excuses or procrastination. He himself will go to the various experimental counties and districts to inspect at any time. Mr. Zou said with a smile that except for the necessary technical personnel, the situation is in dire need of rescue. Mr. Zou also nodded in agreement, saying that he has long been aware of the suffering of the general public in rural areas. Taking Jiangning Experimental County as an example, the total population of the county is only 600,000, including the elderly, weak, and women, and the various tasks undertaken by the county each month, especially the deep understanding that rural construction work must go deep into the bottom layer and be pragmatic in order to be effective, and that it cannot be solved by simply holding a few meetings in the city, and that he is extremely willing to accept all legitimate opinions. Speaking of meetings, Mr. Zou mentioned the situation of the last experimental county government meeting, saying that only the county heads of Futu, Jiangning, and Kunshan attended the meeting to listen to their reports, and although they had only met a few times, he was already clear about their individual personalities and abilities, and said how to supervise them separately in order to achieve the results. I have recently visited these three counties and districts, and I have seen the results and how the personalities of the county heads are in line with what Mr. Zou said. Mr. Zou's concern for talent and willingness to cultivate people is commendable. I think these three county heads should strive to live up to Mr. Zou's expectations. I mentioned that the Executive Yuan has also established an Agricultural Production Promotion Committee and a Cooperative Undertaking Committee. These two institutions are closely related to rural construction work. Will the implementation of the work be redundant or even counterproductive? Mr. Zou thought for a moment and said that the establishment of these three institutions successively had its own special reasons. For the convenience of administration, it seems necessary to have a unification, and the government may adjust them in the future.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Issue of Stabilizing Prices</p>
<p>Because Mr. Zou is also the Secretary-General of the National Economic Commission, I asked him about the current serious price issue. Mr. Zou said that it is inevitable that wartime prices will be higher than peacetime prices, but the situation in our country is unique, and there are many internal difficulties, which have led to a very serious situation. He deeply feels that the only way to fundamentally solve the price problem is to actively increase production. In order to increase production, it is necessary to ensure smooth exchange of materials and appropriate adjustment of power supply. From the government's standpoint, it should start from the root and promote all parties to obtain assistance in order to achieve a thorough solution. If rural construction work can successfully reach a certain stage, the price problem may be solved incidentally. Therefore, he often said that the future of the National Government depends on the success of rural construction work, and it is not just a price problem. (Sent from Nanjing)</p>
<h3>Reporting Director Matsumura's Speech: "The Victor of Leyte" - Only the Stern Spirit of the Special Attack Corps</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Matsumura, the reporting director of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army, gave a radio address after reporting the news at 7:00 p.m. on the 9th, entitled "The Victor of Leyte," detailing the progress of the Battle of Leyte, saying that victory can only be achieved with the stern spirit of the Special Attack Corps. The general meaning is as follows: Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Judging from the vast battlefield of the Pacific and the material resources held by the enemy Americans, this war cannot be ended in a short period of time. The great war in human history should be viewed from the overall situation, and the decisive battle of Leyte is the largest of the Pacific War and will have the greatest impact on future wars. Since the end of October, it has been intensifying. Last month, the enemy landed at Tacloban and Tarac under the cover of superior tanks, and the Japanese side has been preventing them. Now, the enemy is being contained by assault troops. In November, part of the enemy army attacked near Managasnas in the north of Caligala and advanced to the vicinity of Bapa on the east coast of Ormoc Bay, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army's elite troops. At sea, there was the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and in the air, the Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack every day. The deployment of the Special Attack Corps has inflicted major blows on enemy ships and airfields. The fiercest fighting has been around Managasnas and Limon for three weeks since the beginning of November, and by the beginning of December, it had reached a stalemate with no major changes. The enemy's attempt to retake the Philippines is contrary to expectations. What did the enemy Americans expect in the fierce battle of Leyte? It was for the US Army Corps of Engineers to prepare Leyte Bay and for the P-38 and B-24 fighter-bombers and the mobile units on the eastern sea of ​​Luzon to cut off the Japanese supply routes. But can their expectations be realized? Leyte is different from the Solomons and the Marianas. Although they have tried their best to hinder it, the Japanese army can continue to supply from the central mountains of the Philippines. The airfields they prepared, such as Tacloban, Tarac, San Pablo, and Broon, began to be used one week after the invasion. In mid-November, there were about 300 fighter planes, and at the end of November, they were bombed by the Japanese air force. In December, they were attacked by the Takachiho parachute unit and the ground forces' desperate charges, one after another, causing the north and south Broon airfields and the San Pablo airfield to be unusable, and the aviation power of the base was significantly reduced. On the Morotai Island side, the bombing posture of the Japanese land air force has been increasing. Although the enemy airfield has been built in six places, only two can still be used. Today, the main enemy air base in Leyte, the land battle near Broon, is gradually becoming advantageous for the Japanese side. Therefore, no matter what, the enemy is eager to break this difficult situation. On December 7, the enemy, about a division, landed near Alvera on the east coast of Ormoc (Bay), and the Japanese Air Force immediately launched a fierce bombing of this, and the land forces also attacked. Fierce fighting is now underway. Therefore, the stalemate in the Battle of Leyte for the past three days has shown activity. We should know the truth of the current war situation, eliminate all hardships, and move towards victory. The Leyte War is linked to the spirit of the 100 million people and the special attack corps. Its tragic fighting spirit is the Yamato spirit. When this spirit penetrates all occupations, the victory of Leyte will naturally come.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War — Broadcast Speech by Information Director Matsudaira —</h3>
<p>Matsudaira, the Information Director of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio at 7:20 last night, entitled "Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War." The content of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Differences Between Easterners and Westerners</p>
<p>Knowing oneself and knowing the enemy is a prerequisite for victory. Battlefield calculations go without saying. Whether it is a declaration of war betting on the fate of a nation, or diplomatic negotiations in peacetime, one must accurately grasp the other party's situation, measure one's own strength, and make a proper judgment. The victory or defeat of a war depends on the correctness of the judgment, which is by no means an exaggeration. However, such judgments often differ greatly depending on the observer, so they are sometimes inaccurate. In general, the difference between us Japanese and the British and Americans lies in the perception that serves as the basis for judgment, or the attitude of thinking. In short, our perceptions, what we hear, and our thinking are all very different. If you ask what the difference is between Japanese and British and Americans, anyone will immediately answer that it is a difference in race. The differences in color or the special features of the nose, in short, are associated with differences in appearance. But aside from what is said, it is difficult to answer what is different. If you ask what the difference is not in appearance, but in content, it is difficult to investigate its limits.</p>
<p>Different Views on Observing Things Although this difference only results in different views. Japanese people observe things only in the Japanese way, while British and Americans observe things in the British and American way. In other words, Japanese people tend to be more unthinking and act on intuition. They often observe things intuitively and make intuitive judgments. This is the biggest difference between Japanese and British and Americans. On the other hand, the thinking of British and Americans is not unthinking. They observe things analytically and interpretively and then make judgments. Their intuition is not a sluggish activity. This is a characteristic of British and Americans. The Japanese style of observation is the so-called Eastern style of observation. Chinese, Indians, and various southern ethnic groups all have this characteristic. The British and American style of observation is the so-called Western style of observation. All Europeans have common characteristics and views. The Chinese are the most thorough in this Eastern style of observation. Generally, they proceed by intuition. China has the concept of "taking the world," "the world being at peace," and "everything under heaven belonging to the nation," without establishing boundary lines or terms of demarcation anywhere. If they adopt analysis or statistics, they are not very clever. For example, their population is said to be 400 million or 450 million, roughly estimated. That is why, during the Washington Conference, the French representative Briand asked, "What kind of country is China?" In short, it is difficult to understand China if you observe it in the Western way, which is why such a foolish question was raised.</p>
<p>The British and American View of Japan</p>
<p>However, how do the British and Americans observe Japan? The views of the generally knowledgeable classes are that there is a small island nation in the east of the Chinese mainland along the Pacific coast. The people who live there have the wisdom of monkeys, are imitative, and are warlike and aggressive. But the Japanese in this small island nation possess considerable military power and are ranked among the world's first-class nations. Although they sometimes speak arrogantly and rudely, they would be foolish to fight against Britain and America. It is an "incomprehensible country" and an "incomprehensible race." This view is still considered polite. As for the common people, they do not know anything about Japan at all. Generally, middle school history textbooks have about one and a half pages describing Japan. A Japanese painter, a friend of mine, once directly heard this said by a model. He had been working as a model abroad, and gradually developed a good relationship with the painter while diligently learning to paint. They often went out for tea or meals together, and he tried his best to please her. But one evening, they went to see a movie together. The screen showed a "head sacrifice" of African natives and a hula dance scene. The model sitting next to him whispered in his ear, "Your country's scene has already been shown, do you miss me too?" The painter was very angry when he heard this, and could not refute it. His enthusiasm for the model completely cooled down. The foreign country referred to above is probably France. This situation is roughly the same for British or Americans. The general public does not go beyond the scope of this model's view. If you ask how British and American politicians and military leaders observe Japan, they still observe it analytically, interpretively, and with all kinds of statistics and mathematics, calculating Japan's area and resources, and comparing Japan's national power to a fraction of that of Britain and America. Therefore, they said the war would be a three-month affair. This was their observation three years ago, and the generally ignorant public believed it.</p>
<p>Completely Wrong Estimate of Japan Ms. Sakanishi, who worked in the library there for more than ten years in Washington, once said that when she returned on an exchange ship, American friends gave her particularly harmless advice, many saying, "If it takes three months, the war will be over, you don't need to take an exchange ship back to your country, you might as well stay in Washington." Such a view meant that Japan had no strength at all. At that time, America's view of Japan was completely wrong. Why was this? Because the basis of their judgment was based solely on superficial figures and statistics, seeing only Japan's material resources and not taking spiritual aspects into account. This is probably the main reason. But it is probably impossible to express spiritual strength in numbers and statistics and calculate it. The result of the wrong judgment is that America's initial judgment has collapsed, which is fortunate for us. However, the enemy is re-examining Japan's national power to find a way to resist, and has begun to supplement its wartime strength. So far, it has spent an unprecedented 200 billion US dollars in military spending, rapidly increasing the production of airplanes, ships, tanks, large and small cannons, heavy trucks, and other military supplies. The observation that the war would end in the first three months has been thrown to the winds. Therefore, it has converted peaceful industries into military industries, so it has had to drastically suppress civilian needs. As a result, three years later, the national life is getting worse and worse, and social unrest is occurring unexpectedly. The production of military supplies of America, which boasts of its material resources, is also rapidly declining. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Paying Attention to Rampant Prices</h3>
<p>The city's Economic Security Office convened a symposium with the chairpersons of various trade associations the day before yesterday. The purpose was to ensure that the trade associations would maintain close contact and cooperation with the Economic Security Office in the future. The trade associations should strictly order their member firms not to raise prices without authorization before the approved price limit is raised. The trade associations should report the improper behavior and irregular business practices of their members so that they can be strictly investigated. Amidst this rampant price surge, we hope that the responsible persons of each trade association will fully recognize the situation and cooperate.</p>
<p>The price problem has been fluctuating for the past few years, and the time between fluctuations is getting shorter and shorter. For example, the price fluctuations in the middle of last year were separated by half a year or several months. During this period, they could remain stable for a while, and each fluctuation had a leading cause. The situation this year and recently is that each fluctuation is separated by a month or a week, or even fluctuates daily, and there is no so-called leading cause for the fluctuation. This phenomenon can be fully seen in the last few days. Whether it is daily necessities, rice, firewood, vegetables, transportation costs, etc., everything is different today than yesterday, and the market changes three times a day.</p>
<p>Why is this happening? We believe that the simplest reason is that general merchants—to put it more broadly, those who hold goods—have a fixed view on the selling price of all goods, watching each other. If you raise prices, I will raise prices too; if you lower prices, I will not lower prices. So everyone only raises prices and does not lower prices. The general public's psychology of valuing goods over money is becoming more and more intense, so at the time of each fluctuation, they scramble to buy and store goods, and merchants see this as an opportunity to raise prices.</p>
<p>The above are all actual phenomena of rising prices over the years. As for the theoretical knot of the price problem, it is of course due to the shortage of goods, the increase in currency issuance, and the obstruction of transportation. However, these are all inevitable in a wartime economy. However, we always believe that although these are inevitable, it cannot be said that there is no considerable limit. However, the actual phenomenon of rising prices has already exceeded these theoretical limits. In other words, the multiple of the shortage of goods, the increase in currency issuance, and the decrease in transportation is no longer parallel to the multiple of the actual rise in prices.</p>
<p>So why is price inflation so rampant? To sum it up in one sentence, it is due to poor politics. Because of poor politics, the institutions managing prices are fragmented, the laws are inconsistent, and the personnel are incompetent. In the laxity of the entire institution's laws and personnel, even if one or two institutions' laws and personnel have some spirit, it is difficult to reverse the entire adverse phenomenon. The goodness or badness of politics is of course man-made. Therefore, the formation of the phenomenon of rampant prices is also man-made. For example, the recent surge in gold prices is unreasonable, avoidable, and entirely caused by man-made speculation and rumors. Unfortunately, the authorities are sitting by and watching the rampant speculation, unable to directly attack the speculators and strictly investigate them. There have been many examples of rampant speculation in various industries in the past, and this is just one of them. However, the Allied nation Japan also has the same inevitable economic phenomena during wartime, but prices have always been stable, and speculators cannot indulge in evil. This is concrete proof of good politics.</p>
<p>We have always been pleased with the establishment of the Economic Security Office in this city and the devotion to duty of Director Wu Dao and other senior officials. However, the Economic Security Office is only one link in the price management institution. As the saying goes, "A single tree can hardly support a tall building." We hope that the Economic Security Office will pay more attention to the causes of price fluctuations in the future, fully exercise its authority, and strictly investigate and crack down on speculators. At the same time, we also hope that the price management institutions and personnel will be comprehensively rectified and truly assume responsibility. Speculation and profiteering, rampant prices, threats to people's livelihood, and hidden crises all require close attention from the relevant authorities.</p>

<h3>Prices are Soaring Unabated — Take Effective Countermeasures Quickly — Do Not Allow Speculators and Profiteers to Engage in Disguised Activities</h3>
<p>In Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial markets last week, prices continued to rise amidst public anxiety and uncertainty. Incited by speculators and profiteers, the trend of price gouging continued, and it was difficult to reverse the downward momentum. In the financial sector, the price of red gold continued to rise, with purchases accounting for the majority. Outsiders found it difficult to enter the market to buy. Silver prices rose for three consecutive days, reaching 50 yuan. The interest rate on money shop bills remained unchanged, but the hidden interest rate increased, and the situation seemed tight, as those in urgent need of funds did not hesitate to pay higher interest rates. Hua stock prices were relatively stable on Monday and Tuesday, but on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, due to unfavorable market sentiment, rumors were rife. Bullish traders were reluctant to close their positions, so prices rose for three consecutive days. The market only calmed down slightly in the first half of Saturday, as the bullish traders stopped closing their positions and market sentiment turned bearish. In the industrial and commercial sectors, all factories were affected by power outages, making it impossible to continue operations. Production was difficult. Although there were reports of using engines instead, it was only in the initial stage of preparation. It was difficult to predict when the original industrial production would be restored, so the prices of industrial materials did not fall. The market prices of other daily necessities, food, rice, oil, firewood, and miscellaneous grains were all secretly rising. This situation is a real threat to people's livelihood and causes increasing anxiety. Therefore, the general public hopes that the relevant government authorities will quickly devise thorough and effective countermeasures to prevent speculators and hoarders from having room for disguised activities. This will be a blessing for the citizens.</p>

<h3>Facilitating Accommodation for Merchants — Detailed Management Measures for Inns are Being Drafted</h3>
<p>The city police department has found that inns are specifically for visiting merchants to stay in, but at present, most of the inns in the city are used by idle people for entertainment, and they are always full. As a result, visiting merchants have nowhere to stay, which is unreasonable. Therefore, it has decided to manage them, stipulating that each inn must reserve a certain number of empty rooms every day specifically for visiting merchants from other places to stay in. The room numbers of the empty rooms must be publicly listed in the accounting room until the time of the last train or ship. If there are still no merchants staying after that time, they can be rented out. Detailed management measures are being drafted.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Deadline for Collecting Tax Refund Vouchers</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday regarding the deadline for collecting tax refund vouchers. All tax refund checks approved and issued from January 1, 1941 to December 31, 1941 that have not yet been collected must be collected by February 1, 1945. Otherwise, they will be cancelled. Tax refund checks that have already been collected but have not yet been cashed must be cashed at the bank by January 31, 1945. Otherwise, they will also be invalidated.</p>
<h3>Sugar Control Problem — Pending Approval from the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The sugar control problem after the reorganization of the Commercial Administration Council has not yet been resolved. As a result, the sugar control organization of the original Sugar Industry Professional Committee of the Commercial Administration Council has been set up for several months without any real function. Chinese and Japanese sugar merchants have negotiated with the relevant authorities several times and plan to establish a Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association to jointly handle the sugar control task. However, whether the Sino-Japanese Sugar Industry Association will be established or not, whether it will be supervised and guided by the Commercial Administration Council after its establishment, whether the Sugar Industry Professional Committee will be abolished, or whether the original organization will be adjusted and reorganized, is still pending approval from the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Personnel Changes in Huangpu and Lujiawan Baojia</h3>

(Lujiawan District) Chief Liaison Bao Chief Yu Jing, Deputy Chief Joint Bao Chiefs Zhang Dongmin and Zhou Xiangsheng.</p>
<h3>The City's Increased Production Outline — Implemented in All Counties</h3>
<p>The city Economic Bureau has accepted the Agricultural Increased Production Promotion Committee's proposal for increased production work, which cannot be delayed due to its responsibility. Therefore, it has formulated 15 articles of the city's increased production outline for implementation in all counties:</p>
<p>(1) The implementation agencies for guiding increased production work in various places should maintain close contact with the Economic Bureau and other relevant agencies in the future.</p>
<p>(2) The technical personnel of the farms under the jurisdiction of the city and the various improvement zones, the production mutual aid cooperatives affiliated with the cooperative branches, and the responsible personnel of the township and town promotion associations should be given academic and spiritual training at any time.</p>
<p>(3) Each place should promote and reward the planting of agricultural crops with the highest yield per unit area based on the local environment, climate, and soil quality, without adhering to customs and trends. Special attention should be paid to crop rotation to maintain soil fertility.</p>
<p>(4) The purchase price of agricultural products should take into account the cost of farmers and the prices of important agricultural products to each other, or exchange goods for goods based on the needs of farmers.</p>
<p>(5) Training for core farmers and farmer lectures should be held extensively during the agricultural off-season to impart agricultural knowledge.</p>
<p>(6) Spring plowing should be vigorously promoted next year, and rewards should be given for implementing suitable seedling fields and capturing egg-killing rice stem borers to prevent the disaster of rice stem borers this year.</p>
<p>(7) Since the outbreak of the war, the source of chemical fertilizers has been lacking, and farmers have a poor understanding of the use of chemical fertilizers. The use of chemical fertilizers should be promoted and guided to farmers.</p>
<p>(8) Farmers in the countryside are extremely poor. The Economic Bureau and various cooperatives should be responsible for providing low-interest loans from China and Japan and banks to production farmers.</p>
<p>(9) In addition to demonstration operations, local farms and cooperative farms should also pay attention to experimental research work.</p>
<p>(10) Idle wasteland along the railway lines in the city and its counties should be designated for farmers to cultivate or recruit unemployed vagrants in the city. The government should allocate a portion of the funds to establish a reclamation bureau to be responsible for management.</p>
<p>(11) All places feel that there is a lack of agricultural technicians. County governments and cooperatives should run agricultural vocational schools, recruit students with a junior high school graduation level or above, provide them with room and board, and do not charge miscellaneous fees, so that they can receive more than two years of agricultural education. After graduation, they will be assigned to work in the township and town promotion associations.</p>
<p>(12) During the winter, farmers in various places should be encouraged by cooperatives to repair embankments, dredge rivers, and open ponds for water conservancy projects for irrigation and drainage.</p>
<p>(13) Farmers in various places feel that there is a lack of working cattle. Farmers do not know how to raise breeding livestock and allow them to be slaughtered. Therefore, it is planned to conduct working cattle registration. In addition to rewarding the raising of breeding livestock and assisting in the purchase and transportation, slaughtering will also be restricted.</p>
<p>(14) Promote and reward agricultural by-products, such as the processing and manufacturing of agricultural products and livestock products, and the breeding of poultry and fish.</p>
<p>(15) In this year of increased production, funds and materials should be concentrated on increased production. Unnecessary decorations, drinks, and food only increase consumption. Sales of drinks and food should be restricted so that citizens not only develop a habit of frugality, but also shift useful money to prosperous national and people-benefiting undertakings.</p>
<h3>Child Welfare Association Fundraising — Extended Deadline</h3>
<p>The current fundraising campaign of the China Child Welfare Association was originally scheduled to end on the 10th of this month. However, many fundraising committee members were unable to complete their donations on schedule due to busy work. The association's standing committee members, Lin Kanghou and Tang Jinqing, etc., decided to extend the fundraising period by three weeks, until the end of this month. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to assist in raising funds and jointly support this righteous cause.</p>

<h3>Chengyou Cup Basketball — A-League Concludes</h3>

<h3>A Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice Producing Areas (5)</h3>
<p>The Suzhou Cooperative has a capital of 300 million yuan, of which 30 million yuan is from membership fees. It purchases six types of agricultural products: rice, wheat, beans, cotton, rapeseed, and castor beans. Currently, in order to adapt to the current situation, the cooperative is shifting its focus from consumption-based distribution to active production.</p>
<p>The Kunshan Cooperative branch is responsible for purchasing grain in five townships in the second district. The branch has 15,042 members, of which 8,614 are fee-paying members (100 yuan per year). There are 80 mutual aid societies for training farmer cadres, with a total of 6,951 members. When purchasing rice, in addition to paying cash, the following distribution methods are used: 1. For every stone of white rice sold by a farmer, they receive 5 yards of white cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,000 yuan), and 3 bean cakes, each priced at 150 yuan. 2. For every two stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of black cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,700 yuan), and bean cakes. 3. For every three stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of bleached cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 2,500 yuan), and 7 bean cakes. 4. For every five stones of white rice sold, they receive 5.25 yards of twill cloth, priced at 600 yuan (black market price 3,600 yuan), and 8 bean cakes.</p>
<p>The reason why the cooperative can achieve such excellent results in purchasing grain is due to the following points:</p>
<p>1. The cooperative can directly contact farmers and understand the people's hearts, while rice merchants and farmers are separated by brokers, which inevitably creates distance.</p>
<p>2. The cooperative's purchase price is absolutely fair and paid to the farmers. Rice merchants and brokers may exploit the farmers to gain profits.</p>
<p>3. The cooperative cares for farmers throughout the year, while rice merchants and brokers only contact farmers during the rice harvest season and then neglect the farmers' welfare.</p>
<p>Since the cooperative has such advantages, it is hoped that those in the National Government who are enthusiastic about rural construction will not establish organizations such as rural production increase groups, which would result in a proliferation of institutions and a dispersal of power. It would be better to concentrate all efforts on strengthening the cooperative system so that it can be universally applied in rural areas. At the same time, the work of purchasing agricultural products should no longer be handled by intermediaries (such as rice merchants and brokers), but should be directly borne by the cooperative.</p>
<p>7 Farmer's Livelihood Issues</p>
<p>During the inspection trip, the reporter was constantly concerned about the living conditions of the farmers. Listening to lengthy theoretical speeches is not as practical as talking directly to the farmers.</p>
<p>According to the farmers' discussions, the main points can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1. In the Suzhou area, landlords own 70% of the land, while self-cultivating farmers only account for 30%.</p>
<p>2. 60% of farmers in various parts of Jiangsu Province lack funds for farming and borrow high-interest loans from landlords or others, with interest rates reaching 20%.</p>
<p>3. The cost of farming in Jiangsu Province has increased dramatically. Taking the second district as an example, in addition to land rent and taxes, fertilizer is also needed, with each mu of land requiring five bean cakes, costing 2,000 yuan. At the same time, local miscellaneous levies amount to 60 yuan per mu per month.</p>
<p>4. The grain stored by farmers in several districts of Chu County is exhausted between February and March after the autumn harvest. They rely on the harvest of small grains (wheat, naked barley, barley) for a living, and what they eat is "mai tang" (wheat bran gruel). Some even eat wheat bran gruel all year round. In the rural areas near Pengpai Town in Kunshan, most of the rice is sold and transported to Wusong and then to Shanghai, so the farmers eat thin porridge and pot scrapings.</p>
<p>5. Farmers are very concerned about the selection of township and baojia chiefs, because these intermediaries inevitably engage in embezzlement and other activities. For example, when farmers in Changshu sold rice last year, the Rice Control Association issued white, blue, and red vouchers for the distribution of supplies (each voucher could be exchanged for cotton cloth, soap, matches, sugar, and cigarettes). As a result, the farmers only received one and a half feet of cloth, while the township and bao chiefs each had several bolts of cotton cloth, soap, and other large quantities. They swallowed their anger because these people had local power and dared not report them.</p>
<p>The current living conditions of farmers are like this. In Japan, farmers have unlimited self-esteem. For example, in the rural areas of the Bikai district, known as the Denmark of Japan, young people must print "Farmer So-and-So" on their business cards. In China, farmers are pitifully the targets of exorbitant taxes. Now that farmers are the production warriors in the rear, the authorities should treat farmers with respect and reverence, investigate and prosecute corrupt township and baojia chiefs, provide farmers with guarantees, and not only think of farmers when purchasing grain. The policy of valuing agriculture should not be temporary, but should be long-lasting, providing farmers with thorough protection and enthusiastic assistance at all times and in all places throughout the year.</p>
<p>8 Issues of Corrupt Officials and Dishonest Bureaucrats</p>
<p>If there are no corrupt officials in the government and no unscrupulous merchants in the marketplace, then the people's lives will be bright. Since the Hu Incident this spring, thanks to the authorities' decisive action, the people have been very happy. Such corrupt elements cause great suffering to farmers.</p>
<p>When the reporter held a forum in Suzhou, Mr. Takemoto (of the Continental News), a Japanese staff member, cited a concrete example of a corrupt official based on what he had seen to prove the debauchery and shamelessness of such people.</p>
<p>At the same time, he put forward the following methods to thoroughly eliminate such destructive elements.</p>
<p>1. Stabilize the livelihood of officials.</p>
<p>2. Establish strict courts in various places to investigate and thoroughly punish officials who have engaged in corruption.</p>
<p>3. Use local cooperative organizations to implement farmer distribution and purchase to reduce the opportunity for corrupt officials to take advantage of them.</p>
<p>4. It is hoped that the authorities will give the press absolute freedom to thoroughly expose the issue of corrupt officials in order to eliminate those who use good names to deceive farmers.</p>
<p>Expectations from All Walks of Life in Shanghai</p>
<p>After arriving in Suzhou, the reporter paid respects to Colonel Kaneko, the liaison minister of Jiangsu Province. Mr. Kaneko was energetic and put forward two points to the Shanghai side to draw attention:</p>
<p>1. Shanghai is the economic center of China. It is hoped that the financial community of the city can be mobilized to assist in the work of rice management in terms of business, and to inject funds into the rural areas to carry out agricultural loan work.</p>
<p>2. The household registration distribution system in Shanghai must be absolutely accurate. For example, in one district, the allocated household rice is calculated for 80 people, but the actual population is only 70 people. This point must be corrected.</p>
<p>In his conversation with the reporter, Colonel Kaneko advocated a distribution system based on key points: those who contribute to society and the national war should receive increased allocations; otherwise, the allocation should be reduced.</p>
<p>During the inspection period, the reporter was always concerned about the food problem in Shanghai. When inquiring with military officers and those involved in purchasing, he reported the real situation of the food situation in Shanghai to provide them with reference. After completing the inspection and returning to Shanghai, he would like to discuss the following with all sectors of Shanghai society based on what he has seen and heard:</p>
<p>1. Some financial and industrial circles in the city may use their funds for speculative hoarding purposes and are indifferent to rural loans. As a result, 62% of farmers suffer from high-interest loans. It is hoped that they can wake up and inject funds into rural areas, establishing agricultural loan offices to reduce the burden on farmers.</p>
<p>2. It is hoped that citizens will think of the greater good in everything they do, take a long-term view, and immediately stop the brewing of alcohol that wastes grain (especially white wine, which consumes a great deal of grain), and the sugar manufacturing industry!</p>
<p>3. In order to save grain, it is hoped that citizens will eat as much miscellaneous grain as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter informed the citizens that the municipal government has accepted the recommendations of the Municipal Advisory Committee and the support of the industrial sector and will issue Shanghai municipal bonds with a total amount of 150 million yuan. It is planned to use 100 million yuan as a fund to adjust the rice grain funds to adjust the price of allocated rice, to maintain the price of 5,000 yuan per stone as the standard, to protect the people's food in the city. Roughly, this kind of temporary relief treasury bills will be issued before January 1 of the following year. The reporter would like to look forward to this with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions stated that revolution cannot succeed without the help of farmers. Therefore, farmers are the driving force of the country. As a result of the reporter's inspection, he deeply felt that the farmers' responsibilities were lofty and great, but their current situation was also extremely difficult. He would like to appeal to the authorities with the heart of a child, hoping that the authorities can devote all their efforts to eliminate bad elements that hinder the livelihood of farmers, and ban all acts of excessive taxation and extortion against farmers. Only by loving farmers and protecting farmers can production be increased, and society and the country can survive, and the victory of the war can be relied upon. (The End)</p>
