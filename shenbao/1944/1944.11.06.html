<h3>大東亞宣言周年　國府特發表聲明　與盟邦緊密協力爭取勝利</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　六日爲大東亞共同宣言一周年之期，值盟邦台菲大捷之後，此紀念日之來臨，意義實爲重大，我國民政府特發聲明，表明根據共同宣言意旨，互相提携，各自努務其本位工作之決心，茲辭聲明如下：</p>
<p>「去年今日，盟邦日本召開大東亞會簽於東京，集合大東亞各國家之指導者於一堂，共同決意發表大東亞共同宣言，此實爲大東亞各國家，各民族之理念已趨一致之表現。</p>
<p>一年以來，大東亞各國家均能根據此宣言之意旨，互相提携，各自努力其本位之工作，尤以盟邦日本，對於大東亞戰爭迭獲赫赫之戰果，最近復在台灣及菲律賓，將敵美誇稱太平洋美國名署機動部險殲減其大半，從此大東亞戰爭最後之勝利已奠定其基礎。</p>
<p>盟邦日本本其傳統政策，爲確保大東亞之安定，一方面援助東亞各國家，使其能獨立自主，一反英·美之侵略，威脅，獨占，榨取等等手段，而以道義的精神，推誠相與，以建設大東亞共榮圈與新秩序。一方面對奴視東亞各民族，壓榨東亞各民族之英美，予以積極的打擊，不惜犧牲一切，發動此大東亞戰爭，使東亞被壓迫各國家，各民族得以真正獲得解放，進而建設真正世界永久的和平與永久的親和之新秩序。</p>
<p>國民政府自與盟邦締結中，日同盟條約以來，無日不在努力於實踐條約之精神與大東亞共同宣言之理念。</p>
<p>際此大東亞戰爭日趨激烈，國民政府爲與盟邦日本表示進一步之緊密協力，當傾其全力，共向擊減英·美之途邁進，誓不獲最後之勝利不止，特此聲明」。</p>
<h3>傾全力完成戰爭　建真正世界和平　日政府昨發表重要聲明</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　菲律賓攻防戰正懺烈展開之際，適逢大東亞宣言一周紀念日，故其意義尤爲爲深長，日政府爲紀念此有意義之紀念日，特發表聲明，本諸於大東亞共同宣言之五原則，表明從事建設大東亞及完遂擊減英·美之決心，力予排除一切侵略威脅，獨佔，榨取及再建真正的世界和平秩序之目的，近日軍迭在台灣，菲律賓各地擴大戰果，摧毀敵人野望，邁進完遂作戰。大東亞共同宣言發表以來，僅一年期間，大東亞宣言趣旨今已確立，集結大東亞十億總力之決戰體制，值此重大紀念日，對該宣言之趣旨，再加確認，此次聲明在更新團結大東亞十億民族總力，故具極大意義，茲誌其原文如次：</p>
<p>「於決戰正酣之秋，欣逢大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，今特開陳統之政策，惟在安定東亞，確保東亞，使萬邦各得其所，相依相扶，以確立基於國際正義之世界和平。大東亞共同宣言，實爲基於此兩種精神之大東亞各國共同信念之顯露，於茲帝國政府再表明信念，加强與大東亞各國間之提携，完全脫離英·美桎梏，促進以求各國自主獨立爲目的之大東亞建設，並重申決意，遵照本宣言，排除侵略威脅，獨占，榨取，差別，尊重各國獨立與特性，求民政之提高與繁榮，重建正確之世界和平。此次戰爭係受英·美强制壓迫，致不得已崛起，爲維護團體與自存自衛而戰，並爲完成解放，打破英·美不容吾人自立存在之野心，而執起干戈。今日帝國所以爲帝國及大東亞諸國家，諸民族不惜一切犧牲，以國運與敵周旋苦鬥者，目的亦在乎此。英·美爲實現其野心，徒使本國人民死於療癘之山野，葬身於遠隔之海底，彼犯此罪孽，而猶毫無忌憚，威迫各小國家，使其就範，以圖　制世界於一人之手，非但如此，並對帝國及友國企圖征服，成基奴隷，對大東亞諸國家，諸民族，謀再成爲其殖民地，加以支配，作爲侵略與榨取之對象。再英·美專恃宣傳，矇蔽戰局，夢想戰後經營，以惑世人，惟最近我戰果日益擴大，對敵人野心予以擊毀，今帝國誓爲獲得最後勝利，確立公允之世界和平，益加奮鬥，傾全力完成此次戰爭。」</p>
<h3>日小磯首相重申　援助印獨立決心　歡迎鮑斯宴席上致辭</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日小磯首相四日假相邸舉行晚餐會，歡迎自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏，出席者除小磯首相暨各閣僚外，朝野有力人士亦均出席。小磯首相致詞略謂，英國壓迫印度，榨取印度，實已無所不用　極，本人對於此種情形，不禁由衷心引起義憤，於此本人更期待自由印度臨時政府從事熱烈之獨立鬥爭，使印度國內同志一致奮起，內呼外應，將英國勢力驅出印度，建設完全獨立之國家。至於日本，今後自必堅持旣定方針，援助自由印度臨時政府作健全發展，並迅速完成其目的，且於盡可能之範圍骨，從物心兩方面繼續作種種支援。大東亞宣言中之五項原則，其目的在使爲英美侵略勢力支配之東亞得以復興。進而在東亞建立自主獨立與共存共榮之道義世界，以恢復東亞之本然姿態，完成東亞全體民族崇高之共同目標。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞共同宣言一周年</h3>
<p>問：大東亞共同宣言發表以後，如今已整整一年了，究竟其本質如何？願聞其詳。</p>
<p>答：大東亞共同宣言，是中，日，滿，泰，菲，緬，稽印度臨時政府等大東亞地域範圍內各國代表會議，所討論決定的東方的道義精神，謀東亞諸民族國家的共存共榮，各就本位，各盡最大之努力，分擔完遂大東亞戰爭，完成大東亞建設責任。所以，大東亞共同宣言的本質，是完全基於權利平均，義務平均，而爲共存共榮而努力。</p>
<p>問：然則，大東亞共同宣言，是以完遂大東亞戰爭爲前提的，但宣言的內容，則完全講求大東亞各國間的和平建設，究竟應以何者爲努力的重點呢？</p>
<p>答：大東亞戰爭的對象，是英美侵略者；大東亞戰爭的目標，是驅逐英美侵略勢力，解放東亞民族自由。這是眾所週知的。所以，英美侵略者是大東亞建設進程中的障礙，欲求完成建設，必須排除障礙，必先以共同的協力完遂大東亞戰爭。因此，我們今天必須傾注全力貢獻於戰爭。反過來說，如果我們不能完遂戰爭的勝利，或者延遲完遂戰爭的時期，那末，大東亞建設也就不能完成，或者延遲完成。不過，大東亞各國除了傾注全力於貢獻戰爭以外，同時各自努力於政治經濟文化各方面的進步，也就是培養戰力的一途。所以，努力建設與努力戰爭是相輔相成的。大東亞戰爭完遂勝利之日，也就是大東亞建設完成共存共榮之時。</p>
<p>問：現在英美勢力仍未求完全消減，那末，大東亞共同宣言還未能實現，今後應怎樣的貫澈實現呢？</p>
<p>答：英美勢力在大東亞戰爭兩年餘中，已經連受嚴重打擊。不過，敵人百餘年侵略迷夢，仍未警醒，同時，向來吮吸殖民地之脂膏，爲延續其本國生命者，在敵人英美自亦視爲生死之爭。所以，仍以殘餘勢力企圖最後一逞。但最近經盟軍奮勇迎擊，在台灣及菲島東海面戰役中，給予敵美更重大的打擊以後，敵人已至再衰三竭之境。不過，在此最後關頭，我們自亦不能輕視敵人，更應懍於「爲山九刃，功虧一簣」的古訓，自當加緊協力盟軍，最後擊潰敵人，然後才能實現大東亞共同宣言。</p>
<p>問：我們中國的立塲，國內尚未統一，全面和平尚未實現，對於大東亞共同宣言的責任不是更艱難嗎？</p>
<p>答：中國在大東亞範圍骨是重要的一環，對於完遂大東亞戰爭與完成大東亞建設，自應分担極大的責任。不幸的在一國之內，還有受英美挾持的重慶拖戰，自相消耗，因此，全面和平未能實現。但是，我們站在大東亞國家的立塲，感於責任更加重大，政府惟有加倍的革新政治，改善民生入手，使人民愛戴以後，政府强化以後，全面和平自能實現，分担大東亞責任，自能負起了。這樣，才不負大東亞共同宣言的崇高使命。</p>
<h3>陳代主席小磯首相　今晚作交換廣播　滿泰緬菲等政府當局亦將舉行</h3>
<p>南京五日中央社電　五日爲大東亞會議揭幕之一周年，六日爲大東亞共同宣言發表之一周年，際此歷史的紀念日，我國陳代主席與盟邦小磯首相廣播，於六日下午七時三十分開始，我陳代主席廣播時間爲九時三十分至十時，此外滿·泰·緬·菲各國政府當局，均將作紀念廣播，東印度亦將由爪哇中央參議院議長舉行廣播，旅日之自由印度臨時政府鮑斯主席，亦預定作廣播講演，堅固不拔之大東亞團結姿態，益將顯示，完遂戰爭之決意，亦益將宣揚。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日小磯總理大臣及靈光大東亞大臣，於大東亞共同宣言發表一周紀念日，特致電汪院長暨褚外長伸賀，原電如次：</p>
<p>小磯首相　電汪院長</p>
<p>「際茲大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，對閣下及貴國民深表祝意，於本大臣引爲無上欣慰，回顧於國際戰靈正濃時，召開大東亞會議，在會議中採擇向中外闡明之本宣言，實爲大東亞歷史上曠古未有之大憲章。大東亞十億民族，無不正視此盛意之歷史表示，自內心喚起共同之決意與信念，目今戰局日烈，敵對親交友邦加以攻擊，帝國以威武無比之陸海軍勁旅與驕敵苦鬥，期加以擊減。大東亞戰爭實爲決定大東亞諸國永遠命運之神聖戰，大東亞解放興盛之偉業，爲今日吾人應負之崇高責任，不可留賭子孫，帝國在必勝信念之下，期待與貴國之結盟愈益鞏固，大東亞共同宣言中闡明之共同理想，成爲光芒四射之建設大東亞烽火，同心　力互相提携，向完遂大東亞戰爭邁進。」</p>
<p>重光大臣　電褚外長</p>
<p>「欣逢大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，本大臣對閣下深表祝意，引爲無上光榮，際此戰局愈烈之秋，本宣言能經此試練具體實現大東亞征戰及建設之規範，建設大東亞新秩序之步伐，亦飛躍猛進，帝國與貴國之結盟日益堅固，深表欣快，並期大東亞宣言之旨趣逐漸實現，以赫赫勝利，完遂大東亞戰爭。」</p>

<p>周代院長　電日首相</p>
<p>「小磯總理大臣閣下，茲值大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，辱承閣下電賀，無任銘感，回憶去歲今日，貴國召開大東亞會議，集大東亞各國指導者於一堂，共同決意發表大東亞共同宣言，誠爲大東亞歷史上空前之盛舉。現在戰局愈益激烈，貴國忠勇將士，此次在台灣及菲律賓將敵美所誇稱之太平洋美國名譽機動部隊殲減其大半，實屬大東亞戰爭開始以來之最大戰果，今後勝利必屬我人，已可預卜，特根據大東亞共同宣言之理念，勇往邁進，誓與貴國共同完遂大東亞戰爭最後之勝利，謹電復賀，並祝閣下政躬康泰，中華民國國民政行政院副院長代理院長周佛海」。</p>
<p>褚外長電　重光太臣</p>
<p>「重光大東亞大臣閣下，茲值大東亞共同宣言一周年紀念日，辱承電賀，至深感謝，在此戰局猛烈之際，貴我兩國更當緊密提携，根據本宣言之意志愈益邁進，以期爭取大東亞戰局最後之勝利，謹此電復，藉表賀忱，並祝閣下健康，中華民國國民政府外交部部長褚民誼」。</p>
<h3>日援護軍人案　內容發表</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日政府前會研討種種方策，以期澈底加强對軍人之援護，四日閣議中由廣瀨厚相說明，再由閣議決定後，旋由日情報局將此項方策之內容發表如次：「日政府爲使第一綫將兵免除後顧之憂，以應付戰爭方酣之戰局，同時爲表揮國民士氣起見，特決定根據左項要領，以試謀加强對軍人之援護，（一）加强培育陳亡將士遺兒，過按去國家培育陣亡將士遺兒，僅限於其中在經濟上有援護必要，惟今後實施之培育範圍，則係包括陣亡將士遺兒之全部。（二）强化對於陣亡軍人遺兒　之保育，及對於虛弱乳幼兒之保育。（三）强化軍事扶助等，僅量提高軍事扶助之限度，至對於農村出身之軍人遺族家族，則加强勤勞援助。（四）發揚援護軍人之思想。（五）加强援護軍人之機構。（六）講求其他各項措置，迅速賜與各項恩典，並確保其家族生活及對其家族盡最大保護責任」。</p>
<h3>各地一週　主要戰况</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　本週主要戰况如次：（一）日本本土方面，十一月一日下午一時許，敵機數架（均爲四引擎者）侵入東京上空，此次敵機之來襲，係以瑪利亞納爲基地，而以偵察爲主要目的，同時更可視爲敵人在美國國內選舉前之蠢動，今後實有警戒之必要。（二）北方方面，筆機來襲次數，自十月下旬起迄現在止計共二十八次。（三）中國方面，（甲）在桂林準備作戰中之日軍部隊，於二十九日對渝軍三十一軍一百三十一師，一百七十師，七十五軍一百八十八師之一部，正行死守中之桂林，發動總攻擊，十一月一日已突入該市北方停車場，此外，由南方發動進擊之日軍，更切斷渝軍退路，壓縮對桂林之包圍圈，予以猛攻中，在南方方面，日軍刻正於平南，江口墟，桂平一帶銳意準備次期作戰中。（乙）航空作戰，日駐華航空部隊，連日空襲渝軍基地，摧毀渝航空兵力，並協力地上作戰，二十九日急襲恩施飛機場，擊毀渝機十一架，三十日進攻老河口，分別炸毀其地上設施。（四）緬甸方面，該方雨季已過，敵空陸兩方之反攻，逐次熾烈，尤其敵空軍攪亂仰光地區後方補給之企圖航錫蘭島方面敵艦船之動向，均應特加警戒。（五）菲律賓方面雷伊泰島，薩馬島方面之攻奪戰，已日趨激化，台灣海面空戰，菲律賓海面之海戰以及日神風特別攻擊機隊之出擊（戳至現在止已達數次），隨之而積極予敵方航空兵力之打擊，今後當逐日明確最近協力菲律賓作戰之適空軍勢力激增，同時其艦載機則幾乎絕跡，僅有自新幾內亞沿岸出動之B34型機等陸上機羣，呼應局　之作戰，頻頻來襲，敵軍空戰已過最大危機，然敵軍在薩馬及雷伊泰島投入五師兵力，斷不容消極，刻正以各種手段，自後方向前綫輸送飛機，同時並力謀確保該方面之基地，整頓並集合該方面之基地，整頓並集合殘餘之航空兵力，該方面日軍精强陸軍部隊猛力反攻，戰况則日趨激化，此一時之局部制空權及陸地之戰事歸趨，極爲重大。（六）中太平洋方面，敵空軍中繼基地培里琉及摩羅泰島隨同菲律賓作戰之進展，愈形重要，摩羅泰方面，日空軍呼應陸地作戰，自十月十六日起，連日夜襲敵軍機場，將機場設備炸毀多處。又帛琉方面平并嵩尉等之魚雷挺身隊，擾亂敵軍聯絡路，遠藤中佐所率之肉彈突擊隊，更在培里琉北岸上陸成功，展開奮戰，敵軍刻更努力整頓馬利亞納方面基地，藉謀擾亂日本土，但日軍航空部隊精銳三日未明急襲塞班，迭尼安兩島之敵機場，將其摧毀。</p>
<h3>日軍在雷伊泰島　繼續把握制空權　海軍機炸沉敵巡艦一艘</h3>
<p>太平洋決戰全局主動權，今已完全操諸日軍之手，實乃戰局之重大變化，美海軍今後必須考慮今後日海軍之作戰方式，美海軍因日海軍之數次攻擊，其攻擊力，早已低下，尤其要週敵機動部隊更無有組織之亻戰，其空母勢力業瀕破減，實無法隱瞞。菲律賓雷伊泰　方面，敵航空兵力亦極微弱，艦載機幾乎不作出動，對該印席各島之轟炸，過去均以大中型機行之，最近採用中小型機，此亦敵美苦悶之表現。日軍自加達納爾以來，歷一年又九閱月，現已放棄消極的守勢，於太平洋全域開始一大戰略攻勢，在雷伊泰方面予敵機動部隊以潰減之條擊，繼續把握制空權，對敵軍唯一之航空基地摩羅泰機塲，施以澈底之轟炸，同時，並轟炸塞班及迭尼安，培里琉，又日軍陸上部隊，亦敢然作逆下陸行肉搏攻擊，帛琉方面，日軍偵察機隊亦漸活潑，監視敵情，總之，日軍已日益攻勢，刻雷伊泰島依然繼續澈戰，該島日軍之反攻陣容極爲完備，即將展開對美登陸軍之殘減戰。</p>
<p>東京五日中央社電　敵軍自於雷伊泰島登陸以來，即與該島日守軍展開激烈之攻防戰，日陸上部隊猛攻侵入塔克羅班及塔拉克附近之四師敵主力部隊，予以大損害後，逐次向西方整理戰綫，目下正續向塔克羅班西方七公里高地至橫斷雷伊泰溪谷之塔拉克西方十八公里雷伊泰山脈山脚，十公里之戰綫，阻止優勢敵軍之前進，連日激戰甚烈，日軍殺傷敵兵將已達四千五百名。同時，對已淪入敵手之塔克羅班及塔拉克，聖巴布羅各機場，展開猛烈之突擊戰，擊毀敵機達二十餘架，此外，日軍一部隊仍確保深入敵陣之卡塔蒙山陣地，塔拉克北方八公里海岸，反覆重創蝟集之敵軍，日機隊亦響應陸上日軍之勇戰，連日連夜反覆猛炸雷伊泰島敵機場，登陸地點及雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，同時，更在附近海面搜索敵軍，使敵艦船痛遭打擊。敵軍因日軍不斷之猛攻，蒙受損失極大，故連日正向雷伊泰灣內補充運輸船，期完成陸上部隊之補給及飛機場資材之登陸，並圖於大登陸軍之地步，同時，並努力整理橋頭堡內之飛機場。刻該方面日軍已由敵艦上空軍與日機隊之格鬥，進而使敵空母艦潰減，至二日敵軍於塔克羅班機場集結飛機約百五十餘架，是日晚自摩羅泰島方面增援約五十架，一時成爲擁有遠飛機二百之有力空軍，而日空軍之防衛亦更爲嚴密，自是夜至三日黎明，對敵予以猛攻，一舉炸毀敵機百餘架，機場施設十餘處起火。是夜，更空襲聖巴布羅敵機場，使其陸上施設兩處起爲，炸毀探照燈一座，並炸毀塔拉克附近登陸地點，同時命中敵運輸船一艘，使之起火，刻該方面日軍仍在激戰中，士氣旺盛。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地五日中央社電　日海軍航空部隊，一日夜襲塔拉克機場，使十二處起火，二日晨猛攻雷伊泰灣內之敵艦，炸沉敵巡洋艦一艘。</p>
<h3>日軍對桂林　壓縮包圍網　利用迂廻戰攻佔平樂</h3>
<p>廣西前綫五日中央社電　桂林之攻防戰，現已達最高潮，日軍部隊組成之包圍圈半徑爲二十公里，桂林盆地現已全爲日軍所壓制。與互相呼應之日軍另一部隊，更利用迂廻與急襲奪取平樂，由此將美軍於中國西南方備戰之準備完全擊潰。日軍最初對桂林北側之十七·十九軍加以最後猛攻，同時另一部隊於二日晨佔領通達柳州公路上之蘇楷圩，遮斷該公路，將渝第九十三軍·十六軍·第十師各敗殘部隊壓縮至桂林南側之狹隘地區內。又其另一部隊日軍，自三十一日晚即對桂林南方良豐圩，柳桂區附近之渝新編第十九軍加以猛攻，此來桂林盆地南側一面，已全受日軍壓制，而使桂林成爲孤城，陷於包圍網內。又與此包圍網相呼應之其他日軍部隊，於一日深夜奪取桂林南方八十公里之平樂，桂江東側地區已完全受日軍壓制，故茘浦平樂西南二十五公里方面之渝第二十六軍·三十七軍及敗殘之二十軍，均先後潰走云。</p>
<p>日軍先鋒　迫近武宣</p>
<p>華南日軍前綫某基地五日中央一電　制壓柳州流域渝軍陳地之日軍先鋒部隊，刻已迫近駐渝美空軍基地生要據點並防衛柳州要衝之武宣。</p>
<p>華南前綫五日中央社電　渝第六十四軍及四十六軍，爲謀奪回桂平，於上月二十日以來，即據守桂平西方高地，於是西江南岸日軍乃於卅一日以來，對之展開殲減戰，刻仍在猛追殘敗殘軍，並會於三日晨將防衛柳州之有力據點貴縣佔領。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹交通綫　展開爭奪戰　德軍如艦排巨濤推進</h3>
<p>東南歐德軍總司令部五日中央社電　海通社訊：巴爾幹公路綫一帶，正有激烈之戰事，希臘之德軍於數週前開始撤退，今方自塞爾維亞向波斯尼亞首邑塞拉傑伏（Sarajevo）間之距離約數百公里。貝爾格勒失陷後，摩拉瓦河之交通乃告斷絕，德軍現方爭取摩拉瓦河以西之陸上交通綫。此公路起於馬其頓首邑斯科浦經普里斯的那密特羅維加利伊巴谷克拉爾傑伏，再折向西經島齊斯及維斯格勒而抵塞拉傑伏之西。於密特羅維加復有一公路，向西北經諾維巴蕯，普爾加波爾杰，維斯格勒而抵塞拉杰伏。蘇軍及保軍力圖阻德軍之撤退，同時阿爾巴尼亞及門的內杏林哥羅之遊擊隊亦在蠢動中，而蒂托之部下正向海士哥那維（Herzgovina）之首邑莫斯達（Mostar）推進，其最後目標亦爲塞拉杰伏。巴爾幹全境多山，無一定之戰綫，德軍則如狂瀾中之主力艦波浪前進。</p>
<p>戰時洪都　凄涼景象</p>
<p>洪京五日中央社電　海通社訊：洪京已爲戰靈所籠罩，蘇機盤旋上空，高射砲聲及大砲聲不絕於耳。難民乘各種車輛通過市區，多瑙河各橋樑汽車疾駛而過，德憲兵於十字街頭指揮交通，而各市區均呈凄涼景象。居民無要事者當留室內，僅糧食店前尚有列隊之顧客，戰時洪京已無昔日豪華之生活矣。市街常有行軍之軍靴聲，德軍「虎」型坦克車馳往前綫，蘇機掃射市區，空襲警報頻頻發出</p>
<h3>襲日東海道　敵機被擊退</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　五日上午十時至十一時，美空軍B29型機四架，侵入東海道地區，經日軍制空部隊猛烈反擊後，未及投彈即行遁走。</p>

<p>大東亞共同宣言週年紀念特刊</p>
<h3>大東亞各國的建設</h3>
<p>— 本報資料室編</p>
<p>一年前的今日，大東亞六國代表會議，發表共同宣言，大東亞十億民族從此獲得了建設東亞共榮的大憲章，也就是大東亞十億民族已表示以鐵的團結決心保衛東亞，更欲以道義爲基礎，建設東亞，以貢獻於世界和平之確立。</p>
<p>數百年來，以英美爲中心的世界史，從此乃換一新的面目，而開創了新的一頁。一年以來大東亞十億民族在這共同宣言的指示下團結一致，爲完成共同的目標而共同努力。</p>
<p>大東亞宣言之發表，不僅爲建設東亞之最高的光明正大之憲章，且亦足爲新世界建設之最高準則，我人於此大東亞共同宣言週年紀念日，自應更明確把握世界情勢，加倍速奮起，以遂行戰爭，而完成大東之共榮建設。茲將大東亞各國的生產與建設現狀，槪述如後：</p>
<p>中國</p>
<p>去年一月九日，中國根據與盟邦日本同生共死之精神，毅然對英美宣戰，同時，日本實施對華新政策，推誠相助。並於十月三十日與中國締結劃時代的「中日同盟條約」，扶助中國之復興與建設。同年十一月五日，中國參加大東亞會議，六日與各國發表大東亞共同宣言，確立完遂大東亞建設的方針。此後即本旣定方針努力於農業的增產，資源的開發，以及各項戰時建設的推進。可分華中華北兩方面述之。</p>
<p>華中</p>
<p>以華中振興公司及有關係的十五社爲中心的華中建設，至九月三十日，結束了本年度上半期的事業，自十月一日起，進入下半期。綜觀各社上半期事業內容的主要動向，可要約爲下列二點，即：</p>
<p>（一）戰力增强體制之確立。</p>
<p>（一）國策公司之調整及中日經濟合作勢態之强力推進。</p>
<p>下半期事業目標的重點，即在繼續上半期未竣事宜，即：</p>
<p>（一）戰力增强體制之合理運營與增產各計劃之具體執行。</p>
<p>（一）强化業已理解國策公司調整目的之中日經濟合作勢態。</p>
<p>各公司的增產體制</p>
<p>適應前述華中振興公司的措置，其他十五家公司亦各別改變體制，以適合時局。現在與增强戰力有關的公司，計有七家，即擔當開發地下資源的華中礦業，淮南煤礦二家，擔當運輸的華中鐵道，中華輪船，內河輪船，華中運輸四家，及動力部門的華中水電公司一家。此七家公司的上半期事業，皆循超重點主義增產的方向前進。華中礦業及淮南煤礦二公司，採用現塲重點主義，適應鐵·錳·銅·煤之需要的非常增產計畫，已按預定實行。又，新礦脈之發現與新規事業之開發，今後亦未許草率，以華中鑽探組合爲中心，在華中各地施行試躦，陸續發見新礦脈，目下正在計畫其開發，有些地點且已着手採掘，並有相當成績了，是誠可喜。淮南煤礦在供給華中產業原動力這一點上，任務尤爲重要，與最近的煤炭問題相關，其動向極可注意，本年度上半期中，業已完成真正的採煤態勢，有裨煤炭需給之調整實大。如斯，擁有採掘塲達十餘所之多的華中鑛業，其供給華中所需的地下重要資源，事實上巴在計畫以上，而淮南煤礦亦順應當地的需要，迅速强化增產體制，所以對於此二家公司，期望頗大。</p>
<p>發揮增產的效果者是運輸部門。在增加增產物資之運輸的絕對要求之下，華中鐵道及其他船舶關係等四家，正集中全力於强化運輸陳容。華中鐵道現有鐵路一、三一一公里，公路三、〇六〇公里，現正置重於各種運轉設備之恢復强化，並爲增加華北煤炭的陸運，增備車輛及車頭。並着手建築浙贛綫金華—靜江江岸及金華—武義各段路綫，業於上期全部竣工通車。本年四月，復接管華北移讓的津浦綫蚌埠—徐州段，各別增强運輸，對於增强戰力，將有大貢獻。</p>
<p>華中運輸亦與華鐵表裏一體，負起增强運輸陳容的任務，另一方面，中華輪船，內河輪船二水上運輸機關，亦盡力於長江流域沿岸及河川航運之運輸的圓滑。現在，此二公司的航路，長度已突破三千公里。地下資源的運輸固無論，就是華中和平沃野所產的農產物資，也以此航路全力輸送。至於華中水電公司，則克服了煤的問題，斷行節電五成，對重要產業實行重點配電，調整其需給關係。此外，華中電氣通信則樹立强化與大東亞各地聯絡的通信網所必要的對策，而華中水產，大上海煤氣，華中火柴，華中公共汽車等公共事業組織，計畫增產的對策及配給的合理化。他如上海恒產，亦着着推進新敵產地產公司之經營與上海都市計畫之一部分的實行。</p>
<p>華北</p>
<p>華北是大東亞戰爭的兵站，因戰事的日趨激烈，而其使命亦日趨重大。然而重要物資的增產，增送上所必要的各種資材，反愈見短少。怎樣克服這跛行狀况，誘致建設上的勝利，這是十九年度華北的新課題。本年度的開發華北經濟方針之重心，乃輕金屬工業與製鐵事業，其次是煤與鐵礦的增產。</p>
<p>十八年度製鐵事業的重心，是完成從日本移設的特設熔礦爐之建設，這大體已完成了預定的百分之九十。本年度的重心，也全部完成這特設熔礦爐外，並擬開始動工。、</p>
<p>製鐵事業的整備，並其原料鐵確的增產計劃，也已決定。十八年度的華北，蒙疆鐵礦的生產狀况，實際成績約爲計劃的百分之七十，成績不能說好，這是因爲資材，技術不足所致。本年度爲打開這隘路。滿洲工業公司之間已成立諒解，滿業的資材，技術及資本，即將導入該公司，華北與滿洲的聯繋，因此更密切。</p>
<p>關於輕金屬工業，華北輕金屬工業公司爲其中心，當地的準備，依預定計劃進行中。向日本內地定貨的機械，茍能如期運到，本年內可有製品問世。鋁的就地製造與其原料礬土頁岩的增產，亦爲本年度的中心。這增產計劃自二月起付之實施，動力，勞力都稱齊備，遂行政府的增產命令。</p>
<p>再次，說到一切重工業的原動力的煤。此在數量上比法年度並沒有大見增加，可是想到資材不足等的原因，則十九年度的計劃，未必是容易完成的事業。這計劃的重心，在於確保計劃數量，並整備新的藏煤設施，對此，預算上已放出了相當的次金。此外，監的增產計劃，或利用監育成化學工業，及石炭液化事業的整備等，亦爲本年度的重要事業方針。</p>
<p>日本</p>
<p>決戰階段下的日本，其重要任務，在澈底强化國內態勢，迅速增强戰力，舉全部人力物力於戰爭。誠如小磯首相在第八十五屆臨時會議中所宣佈的：（一）昂揚戰意，以堅定必勝信念。（二）增强戰力，使戰局有利展開。（三）增產糧食，以安定國民生活。（四）國民動員，一億國民無論老少各就本位，努力完成所負使命。（五）增强防衛，以求損失上止於最少限度。（六）科學技術動員，求科學技術迅速戰力化。</p>
<p>生產的重點</p>
<p>爲支持國內體制起見，日本國內實行地方分權制，置生產於重點「北海道」·「東北」·「關東」·「東海」·「北陸」·「近幾」·「中國」·「四國」·「九州」等九地方，各有地方行政協議會之組織，各就地方之特殊性，以中央移讓之權限逐次推進實行。其强化國內體制之方策，在使綜合之總力得盡量發揮，使防空以及其他直接影響戰爭遂行不可或非之各種施策，臻至完備，使之生產增多，使陸·海·空三方面之軍力增强。</p>
<p>總之，在使國內一億民眾精誠團結，以完遂戰爭。就各地區分別而觀，北海道地區與東北地區，在增加農產。關東地區（包括東京）在加强農工商一切部門之生產。北陸地區，因該區危重要洪灣，特置重點於海上運輸及增加農產。近幾地區以大阪，神戶爲中心，置重點於擴充軍需工業。中國·四國方面，置重點於增强海運。九州置重點於採礦製鐵等，均負有偉大之任務。</p>
<p>朝鮮</p>
<p>兩大穀倉</p>
<p>日本有朝鮮台灣爲其兩大基地。大東亞兵站基地的朝鮮，就其生產方面言，一方面是日本內地的穀倉，另一方面又是多角性的工業地帶，兩項生產量，在一九四〇年度，農產額二十億圓，工業生產額十九億圓，可說是農工併進。一九四二年的朝鮮米實收量爲一千五百六十八萬七千餘石。一九四三年度的收穫總額約爲一千八百七十萬石左右。目下正在推行下列的增米計劃：即自一九四二年度起，用總額七億五千萬同的　鉅款改進耕種法及改良土地，俾於完成之年（一九五五年），前者增產五百十八萬七千石，後者六百十九萬六千石，總計三千四百六十三萬六千石</p>
<p>朝鮮半島的工業發展，乃是最近十二·三年以來的事情，其基礎則在於水力電氣資源的開發。即由鮮北流域變更方式發現豐富的電原後，繼有離鴨綠江的開發，於是有今日這種多角性的重工業發達起來，</p>
<p>與朝鮮工業有不可分離的關係者，即系地下資源，以咸北，茂山爲首的朝鮮各地鐵鑛，埋藏量達若干億公噸，其重要性固不必說，即爲黑鉛·螢石·重晶石·雲母·猛等，朝鮮亦爲世界屈指可數的產地。這些不但可充當地的需要，就是日本內地也很倚重，其依存的百分率，爲錫百分之百，黑鉛百分之百，雲母百分之百，螢石百分之九十六·八，鎬百分之八三·三，水鉛百分之七四·一，石綿百分之六二·二。此外，稀有元素鑛物不斷發現，現在迅速加以開發。各地現已發現鋯鑛（Zircon）的重要礦床。至於增產成績，一九四二年九·十兩月份，螢石已達百分之一百五十，鉏達百分之一百三十，其他鉛·石綿等，都有驚人的成績。</p>
<p>台灣</p>
<p>台灣離只是三萬三千方公里的島嶼，但在地理上爲大東亞共榮圈的中心點，人口約六百五十萬。台灣一向被目爲米，糖，熱帶果實等爲主的倉糧供給地，但大東亞共榮圈飛躍的發展，已使台灣的性格爲之一變，而成爲軍事上，經濟上，交通上的重要據點。</p>
<p>台灣以前只有農業，工業居於次要地位。自一九三九年起，工業生產額始超過農業。當年工業爲百分之四十六，農業爲百分這四四·四，到了一九四一年，工業爲百分之四七·五，農業僅百分之四一，不過工業大部份是食品工業的生產額。</p>
<p>頻決戰階段的台灣，正向增加生產與培養戰力方面猛進，全島已實行徵兵制度，以便防衛本土，完遂戰爭與建設。</p>
<h3>滿洲國</h3>
<p>滿洲國的開拓政策，就是根據大東亞圈內日本民族分配，移殖，調整的偉大構想下產生的，且突飛猛進地迎刃而解着日滿二位一體的不動國策，爲加强日滿兩國的經濟合作關係，而努力增加主要食糧的生產，爲擴大軍事同盟的國防體制，而愈益成爲堅强的鎮守北方的合堡壘，開拓政策產最近動向，在於殖民政策以及努力增加生產道兩點上。</p>
<p>就是說，開闊第一個五年計劃（一九三七—一九四一）實際殖民成績，爲開拓民四萬六千八十七戶，青年義勇隊遷至滿洲者，爲五萬四千三百七十八人（三年後每年可獨立，各自成立一戶）。（預定計劃十萬戶，預算實行計劃八萬五千八十六戶），成績竟遠超過預算實行計劃。今年是第二個五年計劃，（一九四二—一九四七）的第三年，按照殖民計劃，必須開拓民二十二萬戶，青年義勇隊十三萬人。</p>
<p>此外，遠自日本內地來滿的普通勤勞報國隊，自從建立報國農塲以來，業已收穫到優秀的成績。現在已經有了十七個大農塲的組織，但今年已動員八千名隊員，而新近又設立了三十九個農塲，耕種了一萬五千多海克托。國內的有力公司及團體的自給農塲，今年也打算開闊十二萬海克托的耕地。上述就是開拓政策的全貌。開拓政策也由於大東亞戰爭的關係，而突然改變爲增產第一主義，同時更由於開拓增產綜合動員計劃要綱的決定，而吸收了龐大的農民羣眾，具有極裑雜而錯綜的樣相了。</p>
<p>在產業部門，煤·鐵以至油直岩·鋁·鉏等戰時必需資材的生產，均漸見增大，而豐富的森林資源也於本身開始大規模的夏山採伐，木造船的建設亦漸推進。總之，滿洲國今日正舉其全部能力，向完遂戰爭之途邁進。過去爲煤鐵等原料生產地，處於單純的工業形態的滿洲國，今日動員其豐富的電力資源，電化工業迅速勃興，鋁生產着着躍進，正從原始的原料產地長成爲近代工業國</p>
<h3>泰國</h3>
<p>泰國是大東亞戰爭中最早參戰的一國，位於印度支那半島中部，西南與馬來接壤，有馬來半島及印度的穀倉之稱，在大東亞戰爭中的地位，極爲重要。全國面積約五十二萬平方公里，人口約達一千四百九十萬，而華僑即占二百五十萬之多，居泰國全部人口五分之一。</p>
<p>泰國政府爲了協力戰爭，提出了大東亞戰爭中的六大政綱，即是（一）擁護法權財政經濟之獨立；（二）維持治安，防止犯罪；（三）增進國民經濟福址；（四）確立國民平等權利；（五）確實保障國民之合法自由；（六）普及國民敎育，以期擺脫從來半殖民地的地位，實現泰國之自由獨立。</p>
<p>最主要出產的米，每年產量達三千八百萬石，其中十分之四可以輸出，供給大東亞各國，其品質達勝於西貢米。其次如東北部山岳地帶的柚木，麻栗等，尤其是後者爲主要的造船材料，泰國所產，約佔全世界總產量的百分之六十五。此外軍需原料的橡膠，及輔助運輸工具的象，礦產中間第一位的錫，以至金、銀、銅、鐵、錳、銻、鉾、亞鉛、石棉、水銀及紅寶石等、都很著名。</p>
<p>泰國政府於本年八月間實行改組，在阿巴溫新首相領導下，得人民議會的强力支持，實行新戰時政策。內政方面，更新宣傳方針，禁止徵用非軍事工程的勞力，掃除官界宿弊，昴揚民氣。外交方面，與盟邦日本密切聯擊。經濟方面，着手抑平物價，振與民間工業。並發起青少年運動，統一國民意識。</p>
<h3>緬甸</h3>
<p>去年八月一日，緬甸正式宣佈獨立，緬甸一千六百萬民眾，脫離五十年來英國的桎梏，在巴莫國家代表領導之下，從事復興與建設。最先是業固國內各民族的團結。邊疆的泰拉印族，喀欽人，欽人，阿拉干人等，都包羅在緬甸新國家之下。同時實行各項緊急設施，如道路貨船的建設，橋標堤防的修建，鐵路的復活等，已有垂百萬的人員，不分盡夜，流汗工作</p>
<p>緬甸的新生，從各分野均可看出，產業及經濟方面亦然。號稱緬甸寶庫，爲其經濟中心的伊拉瓦底三角洲方面，晨昔確據一方盤剝農民的金融業者，今日亦已完全肅清。代之而興的，則爲庶民銀行，以及最近創辦的緬甸國立銀行。過去長久苦於以英國爲背景的印度資本之跳梁的緬甸，今日自身擁有國立　銀行，實屬劃期的進展。確立這種金融的自主性，其意義就是將許多肥沃的土地歸還緬甸農民，如是更增緬甸前途的光明。</p>
<p>緬甸政府的新方針，即在於實現緬甸經濟的自給自足。各項施策，皆集中於自主的自給自足的產業，以期從過去殖民地性的分配生產國家一躍而成獨立自主的生產國。</p>
<p>爲求民生之安定，尤其對食糧及日用品之確保，緬甸政府計劃與日本絕對提携。在軍事方面的協力更爲顯著，現已供出八十萬的勞動者，盡夜協力日軍工作</p>
<p>同時，巴莫國家代表，最近又就任「大緬甸聯盟」總裁，該聯盟爲純粹之國民團體，目的動員國民總力，昂揚剛民戰意，以完遂大東亞戰爭。</p>
<h3>菲律賓</h3>
<p>菲律賓自去年十月十四日，正式宣布獨立，成爲共和國，由過去美國殖民地的黑暗地獄，一躍而成爲明朗的新天地。</p>
<p>新菲島和共國在洛勝爾大總統領導下，從事整備政治，强化國內態勢，復興經濟，不遺餘力。</p>
<p>菲律賓的國民經濟，完全以農爲爲基礎，戰前農產物的輸出總額，約百分之八十輸向美國這種依存美國的經濟組織，現正逐漸改善，其經濟建設的中心，必然生於提供爲維持遂行大東亞戰爭力土所要求的資源。所以物資開發的順序，視其緩急，第一先生取得鑛產資源，同時，從其地利的條件而言，先從事栽培棉花，苧蔴等纖維資源。以前在美國的統治下，鑛物資源的開發，以金鑛爲重心，現在則其重心轉移到銅，錳等重要鑛產。而鑛區的維持和設備的復舊，亦爲當前的急務，產銅，錳，鑛，鐵等的鑛區，已着手開掘。其他銅區亦在積極恢復舊觀。</p>
<p>關於棉花的增產計劃，例如在呂宋島一九四二年末，在預定面積約六成上，種植成功。</p>
<p>爲應整備國力應付決戰，進行種種緊急措施，如限止交通，疏散人口，並肅正思想等，誠如洛勒爾大總統所說的「吾人之當前急務爲維持領土內之和平與秩序。今後萬一有不逞之從，妨害吾人之重建計劃，威脅共和國之存在時，即爲吾人之公敵。最近敵美企圖侵入菲律賓海岸，已遭到猛烈抵抗了。</p>

<h3>大東亞共同宣言　三十二年十一月六日</h3>
<p>夫世界各國各得其所，相倚相扶，以同享萬邦共榮之幸福，此乃確立世界和平之根本要諦。惟英美兩國唯已國之繁榮是圖，壓迫其他國家，其他民族，尤其對於大東亞橫加侵略，恣意榨取，並肆行其奴化大東亞之野心，致大東亞之安全根本推翻。此次大東亞戰爭發生之原因，即在於此。故大東亞各國，應互相提携，力求完成大東亞戰爭，使大東亞解脫英美之桎梏，保障其自衛，根據左列綱領，建設大東亞，俾有助於世界和平之確立：</p>
<p>（一）大東亞和國共同確保大東亞之安定，以道義爲基礎，建設共存共榮之秩序。</p>
<p>（二）大東亞各國，互相尊重其自主獨立，力求互相敦睦，以確立大東亞之親和。</p>
<p>（三）大東亞各國，互相尊重其傳統，發展各民族之創造性，以闡揚大東亞之文化。</p>
<p>（四）大東亞各國，本於互惠緊密提携，以促進其經濟發展，增進大東亞之繁榮。</p>
<p>（五）大東亞各國，增進萬邦之友論，撤廢人種之差別，普行溝通文化，進而開放資源，以期貢獻於世界之發展。</p>

<p>通電全國青年呼籲和平</p>
<p>中國青少年團上海特別市團部中國青年　節　第四聯隊七萬餘團員，於十一月六日大東亞共同宣言紀念日，特對全國青年同胞發出通電，呼籲一致團結，實現全面和平，俾對內能統一建設，對外完成自主獨立，陳詞懇切，讀之無不感動，茲將原電全文探錄如下：</p>
<p>「全國青年同胞公　：際此嚴重時局之下，青年同胞必然苦悶極了，任何人的心願，都感到千鈞之重的壓迫，我們的自由解放在那裏？我們的獨立自主在那裏？一世紀以後的現在，我們更走到了生死存亡的歧途，我們今後是生是死，是存是亡，就得看現在最後的一步了！從滿清到民國，中華民族的前途曾經透露過一綫曙光，可是沒有多少時候，這曙光便漸漸　　而幾呼消減了，到了北伐成功，我們的前途又透露出一綫曙光，可是不久以後，這曙光又被黑暗所遮蔽了。這黑暗是什麼？是軍閥的割據，政客的跳梁，貪官污吏的橫暴，這些事實，招來了四分五裂的狀態，和帝國主義的加緊侵略，更招來了中日兩國八年慘痛的戰禍。從民國成立以來，我們老百姓只有一個要求，對內統一建設，對外是平等自由，凡是陰謀要我分裂的，都是我們的敵人，凡是以不平等待我的，更是我們的敵人，現在正是我們需要團結最急迫的時候，不團結，國內不能統一建設，更無法擺脫帝國主義所加於我們的束縛。日本對英美作戰，已經將英美武力驅逐到東亞以外了，我們將怎樣？這是一個最緊急，而又是一個透露着曙光的關頭。我們將奮起爭取解放呢？還是聽任英美蟠據把我們的國家作戰場呢？還是保持我們的原來的劣根性，無論誰勝誰敗，總是繼續做次殖民地的順民呢？從和平運動開始以來，日本對於中國的政策，已經起了一個極大的轉變，從去年十月卅日中日同盟以後，日本更表示出以平等待我的至誠，並且在同盟條約上簽定一日本國約定於兩國間恢復全面和平戰爭狀態終了時，撤去其派在中華民國領域內之日本國軍隊」，更約定「日本國根據北清事變北京議定條款及其有關之文書所有之駐兵確槪予放棄」，以解決中日之間的糾紛。日本不撤兵，中日當然難以和平，然而重慶無和意，日本也難以實行撤兵。這是一個最重要的關鍵，它操縱着中日的全面和平，更足以決定中華民族整個的命運，全國青年同胞，我們應該怎樣？</p>
<p>中日同盟條約是日本以平等待我表現，大東亞宣言更是東亞民族互相尊重主權完整的保證，我們旣有了東亞民族解放的事實，更有了日本在條約上的諾言，還等什麼而不趕快實現全面和平，對內謀統一建設，對外完成獨立自主呢？况八年的戰禍徒然替共產黨造成了擴充勢力的機會，倘然再讓它牽延下去，國家民族的　患真是不堪設想！！青年同胞們，前面已是生死興亡的懸崖了，快快勒馬吧！我們一致呼籲：要求實現全面和平！要求統一建設！反對英美在我國登陸，以我國爲戰場！要求真正的自由！要求真正的解放！要求真正的平等！」</p>
<h3>上週主要食用品　漲勢未見遏止　金融工商各業市况平高靜</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各業市况，上週間較之前週平靜甚多，交易平淡，金融方面無甚榮辱，因中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處，已依照財部頒佈强化上海特別市金融機關業務綱要條文規定，擬就實施辦法，開始辦理强化金融機關工作。尤其對於金融機關放款業務，決定即日起實施檢查，務須依法經營，不得超過三百萬元之限制。是以各行業受此限制，已不如前濫泛放款，銀根始而鬆弛，金融非行動態，似較減少，投機商無法利用資金活動。　　行情始終　疲不撅，工商業方面則以市經濟局開始全市倉擴大檢查，囤積貨物，裕　出　拋售，物價　風截止。世關主要食用品，漲勢未見遏止，如米，油，雜糧等市價跌少漲多，此種情形，當局已在嚴密注意取締。</p>
<h3>警局調整　員警薪津</h3>
<p>本市警察局業經遵照市府頒佈調整薪俸津貼蜛法，擬定官等官俸調整法，於九月一日起實施。其擬訂調整辦法，以簡任一至八級，　任一至十二級，委任一至十六級等官階，分別按基底薪，照中央新訂辦法加成，並給以第一種及第二種津貼。第一種津貼係　據該局人員現行待過，與中央新訂辦法比較之差額訂定。因該局現行待遇，在底薪一百四十元以下者，比中央新訂標準爲高，茲旣改照中央辦法，故訂定第二種津貼，藉以補足差額，俾在一百四十元以下之人員，仍不夫現支數字。至於前工局員警薪津，按照調整市府　有人員薪津辦法發給，前一局員警薪津，改照市府調整表規定之，便比原薪津該表超過之額，作爲旣得特殊利益照發，其所得總額，不得減低。惟前一局員警之特殊利益，以八月底之所得定額爲度，嗣後不再增加。故調整後之前一局員警待遇，與前所得薪津總額相稱，前工局員警之待遇，已依照調整辦法予以提高。</p>
<h3>三輪車檢驗　定十日截止</h3>
<p>市公用局，月前開始嚴格檢驗全市營業三輪車，至今大部已告峻事，對各車輛煞車不良，車篷漏水，或顏色不淺等事，均加糾正，飭令　　，重行檢驗，頃悉各查輛檢驗，定於本月十日截止。</p>
<h3>稅務署調整　煙酒稅率</h3>
<p>財政部稅務署，爲適合戰時體制之稅政，自逐步調整各種統稅特稅稅率以來，稅收較前銳增，茲以土烟土酒薰煙葉三項稅率，亦應加以調整，現已定於本月三日起，將以上之土烟，土酒，薰烟葉三項稅率，照原估價一律增加二倍速，仿紹於二倍外另增二百元，該署已通飭江蘇浙江安徵三省印花烟酒稅局遵照辦理。</p>
<h3>滬市司法人員　准給臨時津貼</h3>
<p>本市各級司法機關之司法人員，葉經司法行政部准予撥給臨時津貼，促使各員生活之漸趨安定。上海高等檢察署，昨特飭令所屬，此後應仰體部方意旨，各自努力本位工作，以身作則，樹立司法風紀。地檢署奉令後，當即轉飭該屬全體人員，一體凜遵。</p>
<h3>財局舉行　各區稽征會談</h3>
<p>市財政局爲切實整頓全市稅收，並明瞭所屬各區經征情况起見，特於日前在該局召集全市各區稽征處主任，舉行會談，由袁局長主席，除聽取各區稅收情况外，復對加緊征收，以裕府庫，均經詳密指示。</p>
<h3>業主不在房地產　應從速申請</h3>
<p>本市業主不在房屋土地管理委員會，自奉令組織成立後，積極辦理本市各區業主不在之房屋土地等登記，發運及處理等事務。茲悉，該會滬北區辦事處，爲促使一般業主或地主，從速協力申請，以便早日結果起見，深盼業主勿取觀望，或暱而不報及違反政令之態度。</p>

<h3>菩提學會談佛</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>夕照清波裏，金飛太液池！</p>
<p>白楊悲日暮，蒼狗幻雲奇！</p>
<p>欲訪菩提舍，先參玉佛姿。</p>
<p>梵天玄影渺，宇內請　時。</p>
<p>上面五言詩一律，是我今天（十月十八日）下午時到北海菩提學會去時，在玉帝橋畔一處茶座所草的，當時確可表達我對景而生的感觸。我爲什麼要去參觀黃道菩提學會呢？重要的乃不在我是否相信佛敎，而是因爲它負有一種極爲崇高的使命之故。大家也許還有知道他們確然有腹行那種崇高任務的可能哩！那末菩提學會空間是什麼團體呢？表面上，這只是一個研究西藏密宗的佛學會，其實假定有相當人才的話，却是溝通中藏文化的一個工作機關。西藏並不是外國，可是它在我國國境內握有一個特殊的地位。不僅因爲它民情風俗的特殊，而且還製有一宗文化的遺產——佛敎吾學。佛敎儘管以印度爲產生地，可是今日猶保有其佛學研究精神的，却不在印度而在我國的西藏。</p>
<p>放下屠刀立地成佛</p>
<p>菩提學會的會長是湯住心氏，他也可說是我國潛心研究西藏文字和哲學的唯一政治家。如果讀者不易健忘的話，當知在袁世凱時代有一位湖南督軍湯蓮銘，住心就是他放下屠刀後潛究佛學所改的大名。記者此次由於他的介紹，乃特往該會參觀，並蒙該會導師西藏喇嘛賽持上人接見，深感榮幸。原來「菩提」二字，源出梵文，意思就是說覺悟。他們潛心佛學而深通藏文的一羣，除湯氏之外尚有周叔迦，劉彭翊，楊大光等幾個人，就在中日事變的那一年根據了菩提的含意，在北京北海白塔之前，成立了這個學會。當時創辦人中尚有一位來自後藏的安欽呼嗣克圖，所以賴着一般熱心人士的捐助，把一座古剎修理得美輪美奐，今日在這個湖影山光之中，真是越顯得它的古雅了。</p>
<p>瞻仰佛像智慧叢生</p>
<p>每一個人，當他自北海公園南門入口進內，直向北走，過了橋就看見塔矗立在上，白塔之前就見有菩提學會四個字，這原出自湯住心氏的手筆。據湯氏說，這個學會的辦成實是他平生一大快事，可見他確有把溝通中藏文化來做他終年事業的意志。現在他翻譯的西藏經典甚多，皆由菩提學會出版。當記者去參觀的時候，剛巧湯氏也在那裏禮讀法會，他便倩一位同好陪着我指點一切。在正殿裏，他們供奉着宗喀巴大師的那位班　佛像。我對於佛敎固然是外行，可是一入其門確也感覺到智慧眾生，可知佛只是智慧的別名吧！在正殿的對面，也有一座佛堂，那是供着三世（包括現在過去未來）的如來佛，不過那座佛堂較小。一般喇嘛做法會的時候，都是在正殿舉行的。正殿之西首，另有一座導師的寢舍，我就在那裏見到了賽持上人。</p>
<p>賽持上人生長於前藏，當你一見他的時候，彷彿和圖畫上見到的達賴喇嘛差不多，我想西藏的人大都是那個樣子吧。在事變以前，有一次我從上海到南京的時候，在國廂中對面忽然坐着一位光頭而穿西服的人，當時我聽他怕說話當他是日本人（因爲樂懂日語），後業我用英語和他說話時，才知道他乃是西藏駐京代表圖丹桑結。他原來是到上海去迎接新近由西藏來滬的一位大格西（類似博士）的。他也是那個樣子？不過這位導師却更覺得特別慈祥罷了！據說這位上人他能知過去未來，不過他平時不輕啓齒，所以我也沒有辦法。他到北京來雖已有七八年，可是國語或者還不是十分純熟，所以我也不太易和他攀談。幸而楊大光先生在側，有時他替我解釋，我才明白一切。</p>
<p>殺盜淫妄四大戒條</p>
<p>在導師寢舍出來，我又順便問了些關於菩提學會的內容。據說他們現在有會員三百人左右，包括男婦會員在內。他們在北京曾設立施診院一所，並在會內開辦藏文講習班，來學藏文的青年學子也很多，不過一般都沒有恒心，所以尚不見有何成績。大東亞戰前，他們對西藏南時有人來往傳達經典，但是現在却和西藏完全隔絕了。他們希望在戰後能有偉大的發展，而替祖國統一的前途略獻微勞。他們最大的戒條有四，即殺·盜·淫·妄·這也是西藏密宗的戒條。</p>

<h3>請酌减學生車資</h3>
<p>— 梁啓萍</p>
<p>今日凡乘搭公共車輛者，大槪不外乎三類人，一爲爲生活奔走的工作人員－包括工·商·醫·敎等。二爲偶然客串性的代步者－包括主婦·購物·往娛樂場·訪友·及其他·三爲學生－包括初高中以致大學，然而其間學生又的佔四份之一數。</p>
<p>在戰端未啓前，在公共車輛中學生確難得見到，可是戰事以後。學校本身方面，已是擁護不堪，那再有量舍能供給學生住宿，所以學生大都是走讀的，然而除小學初中等衖里間在在皆是外，其餘比較高年級正式學校者，大都是在偏僻之處，也有在西北絕端，也有設在南京一路等各熱鬧市街大厦間，總而言之，大都份與住宅區相離甚遠。步行當然亦需要在時間和能力的。講到自由車固然是目下代步等惟一利器，可是巨大的車價，已是超過一般的購買能力。所以歸根結底的方法，只有賴於電車（多數）及公共汽攻了。</p>
<p>攏統計算起來，大概指車一次，需資十元（包括遠·近·前八區·前一區·無軌·有軌·公共汽車·單乘一路，及據車等）大槪每天平均三次（有上下午上課及半日上課之分），那麼每天就得付車買三十元，每月以二十七日計（星期日除外）則需八百十三元，每學期五個月計，共需四千〇五十元（約會學費百分之八九十），月票前入區需一千元，十六歲以下對折五百元。如此統計下來，數目確係驚人。</p>
<p>在學生與普通乘客相比較起來又不同了。一個是事生產者；反之，一個却是事消費的。誠然這筆一偌大費用毫無異議的加在家長們層上，然而簡接却一是造成失堅靑年的因素，無形中却替中國增製了一驚未來文盲，樹立了一層預期的積弱。爲了這許多利害關係，所以不得不向各車輛公司當局請求呼籲了。請求當局能憑着他們一的能力來酌量遞减學生等的事實，另訂僵待辦法。在公司當局方面，區區之數無異　　飲河，不足爲慮，可是在學生方面却已是受益感思匪淺了。同時這也無形替中國劇除了一層「城狐社電」的伏患。</p>
<p>車站劃綫蒭議　展鴻</p>
<p>近因車輛漸總稀少，乘客突形擁擠，而有車站排隊挨次登車之舉，允稱便利，用意甚善，不過現施辦法，尚嫌美中不足，如有些車站，客人特衆，旣以行列過長，自得反復交錯，並且一任自由列去，陣客時感感覺同，往往余人難覺其端，不知從何列起。尤其轟等三等，又無顯著標誌，辨別殊非易易，故常互相誤列，迨至察覺，耗時已久，然後從新列起，可讀不便之極！不寗唯是，也許人多無此經騐。動毗立在馬路中心，取竟脚踏軌道上面車來纔狼狽逃避，這不但足廠交通，而見能招危險呢！</p>
<p>依我的愚見，電車公司應因地制宜地劃定合理的界綫，頭等用結色，三等用白色，俾便人們得以遵循，不處致誤。這樣，電車公司所費無幾，乘客受益寔大哩。（酬移助學）</p>

<p>女靑年會成立到現在，已經是三十六年了，該會事工的經費，一向是本着「取之於社會，用於社會」的原則而向社會捐募的，也因爲她們工作的努力和切合社會實際的需要，她們一年一度的捐款，總是很容易達到預定的目標。</p>
<p>可是，近幾年來，物價的高漲，影響了整個上海慈善性的或救濟性的工作，女靑年會，自然也是不能例外的遭受了這經濟艱難的厄運，她們事工的開支，每年每年在增加，而社會的一般經濟能力，却似乎一年年在裏落。根據事工的需要，她們明年度的開支，至少需要八百萬元，聰說從本月份起，她們就在進行這八百萬的徵募運動。</p>
<p>這「八百萬」的數字，似乎是相當浩大的。但是，如果我們在了解和認識女靑年會的工作後，我們會覺得這是最低限度的需要。女靑年會的工作範圍是很廣的，她們服務的對象，包括有社會的各階層，最重要最基本的工作，有着二所托兒所，一所兒童院，和四個義務學校，其他還有婦女家庭生活指導，學術演講，各種人材訓練，勞工救濟宿舍，寒衣……等一般性工作。。托兒所，兒童院等，都是救濟性質，或是至少需要部份補助的。在目前，普通一個敎養機關，已是很不容易維持，何况是包括一着那末許多工作的女靑年一會呢！</p>
<p>同時，我們覺得最重要的一點，是女靑年會的捐募，在本質上是和一般慈善勸募不同的，她們的事工都在培養着年靑的一代新的一代，意義是非常積極性的。因此，我們覺得，這一次女靑年會巨大數額的捐募，還是會謀到社會上許多正義人士的贊助和熟心的。我們要帮同女靑年會來完成這個募捐的義舉，我們要使她們的許多有價値，有意義的事工總續下去，爲社會造福，爲人盡造福。（海燕）</p>

<h3>First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration: National Government Issues Special Statement, Closely Cooperating with Allies to Strive for Victory</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): The 6th marks the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Following the great victories of the Allied forces in Taiwan and the Philippines, the arrival of this anniversary holds significant meaning. Our National Government has issued a special statement, expressing its determination to support each other and diligently fulfill our respective duties based on the spirit of the Joint Declaration. The statement is as follows:</p>
<p>"On this day last year, our ally Japan convened the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, gathering leaders from various countries in Greater East Asia to jointly resolve and issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This is a manifestation of the convergence of ideals among the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the countries of Greater East Asia have been able to support each other and diligently fulfill their respective duties based on the spirit of this declaration. In particular, our ally Japan has achieved remarkable war results in the Greater East Asia War. Most recently, in Taiwan and the Philippines, it annihilated a large portion of the enemy American mobile units, which the United States boasted as the best in the Pacific. From this point forward, the foundation for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War has been laid.</p>
<p>Based on its traditional policy, our ally Japan aims to ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. On one hand, it aids the countries of East Asia, enabling them to achieve independence and autonomy, reversing the aggression, threats, monopolization, and exploitation of Britain and the United States. It engages with sincerity and promotes the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and a new order based on moral principles. On the other hand, it actively strikes at Britain and the United States, which despise and oppress the peoples of East Asia. It spares no sacrifice and launches this Greater East Asia War, allowing the oppressed countries and peoples of East Asia to truly gain liberation, thereby building a truly permanent world peace and a new order of eternal amity.</p>
<p>Since the National Government concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty with our ally, it has strived daily to put into practice the spirit of the treaty and the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>As the Greater East Asia War intensifies, the National Government, in order to express further close cooperation with our ally Japan, will devote all its strength and advance together towards defeating Britain and the United States, vowing not to stop until final victory is achieved. This statement is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Devote All Efforts to Complete the War, Build a True World Peace: Japanese Government Issues Important Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): As the battles in the Philippines are unfolding fiercely, coinciding with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration, its significance is particularly profound. To commemorate this meaningful anniversary, the Japanese government issued a special statement based on the five principles of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, expressing its determination to engage in the construction of Greater East Asia and the complete defeat of Britain and the United States, striving to eliminate all aggression, threats, monopolization, exploitation, and to rebuild a true world peace order. Recently, the Japanese army has been expanding its war results in various places in Taiwan and the Philippines, destroying the enemy's ambitions and moving towards the completion of the war. Since the issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, in just one year, the purpose of the Greater East Asia Declaration has now been established, and a decisive battle system that gathers the total power of one billion people in Greater East Asia. On this significant anniversary, the purpose of the declaration is reaffirmed. This statement holds great significance in renewing the unity of the total power of one billion people in Greater East Asia. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>"In the autumn of the fierce decisive battle, we are pleased to celebrate the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, we specially open up unified policies, only to stabilize East Asia, ensure East Asia, so that all countries can get their place, support each other, in order to establish a world peace based on international justice. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a manifestation of the common belief of the Greater East Asia countries based on these two spirits. Here, the Imperial Government reaffirms its belief, strengthens the cooperation with the Greater East Asia countries, completely breaks away from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and promotes the construction of Greater East Asia with the aim of independence and autonomy of all countries. We reiterate our determination to abide by this declaration, eliminate aggression, threats, monopolization, exploitation, discrimination, respect the independence and characteristics of all countries, seek the improvement and prosperity of civil administration, and rebuild the correct world peace. This war was forced by the coercion and oppression of Britain and the United States, so we had to rise up and fight for the protection of the group and self-preservation and self-defense, and to complete the liberation, break the ambition of Britain and the United States that does not allow us to exist independently, and take up arms. Today, the Empire is willing to spare no sacrifice for the Empire and the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia, and to fight bitterly with the enemy with national fortune, also for this purpose. Britain and the United States, in order to realize their ambitions, only cause their own people to die in the mountains and fields of healing, and be buried in the distant seabed. They commit this sin, and still have no scruples, coercing various small countries to comply, in order to control the world in one person's hands. Not only that, but they also attempt to conquer the Empire and friendly countries, to become their slaves, to plan to make the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia their colonies again, to dominate them, and to be the object of aggression and exploitation. In addition, Britain and the United States rely solely on propaganda, deceiving the war situation, dreaming of post-war management, to confuse the world. However, recently, our war results have been expanding, destroying the enemy's ambitions. Today, the Empire vows to win the final victory, establish a fair world peace, and strive harder, devoting all its efforts to complete this war."</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Koiso Reiterates Determination to Aid Indian Independence, Delivers Speech at Welcome Banquet for Bose</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): On the 4th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso held a dinner party at his official residence to welcome Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India. Attendees included Prime Minister Koiso and cabinet ministers, as well as influential figures from both the ruling and opposition parties. In his speech, Prime Minister Koiso stated that Britain has oppressed and exploited India to the extreme, and he could not help but feel righteous indignation at this situation. He further expressed his expectation that the Provisional Government of Free India would engage in a fervent struggle for independence, encouraging comrades within India to rise up in unison, responding internally and externally, to drive British forces out of India and build a completely independent nation. As for Japan, it will certainly adhere to its established policy of assisting the Provisional Government of Free India in its sound development and promptly achieving its goals, and will continue to provide various support in both material and spiritual terms within the possible range. The purpose of the five principles in the Greater East Asia Declaration is to enable East Asia, which is dominated by the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, to be revived. Furthermore, to establish a just and moral world of autonomy, independence, coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia, to restore the original posture of East Asia, and to complete the lofty common goal of all the ethnic groups in East Asia.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>Q: It has been a full year since the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued. What is its essence? We would like to hear the details.</p>
<p>A: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is the Eastern moral spirit discussed and decided by the conference of representatives from various countries within the Greater East Asia region, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and the Provisional Government of Free India. It aims at the co-existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations, each fulfilling its responsibilities to the fullest extent and sharing the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is entirely based on equality of rights and obligations, and striving for co-existence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Q: So, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration takes the completion of the Greater East Asia War as a prerequisite, but the content of the declaration is entirely about peaceful construction among the countries of Greater East Asia. Which should be the focus of efforts?</p>
<p>A: The target of the Greater East Asia War is the British and American aggressors; the goal of the Greater East Asia War is to expel the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States and liberate the freedom of the East Asian nations. This is well known. Therefore, the British and American aggressors are an obstacle to the progress of Greater East Asia construction. To complete the construction, it is necessary to remove the obstacles, and the Greater East Asia War must first be completed through joint cooperation. Therefore, today we must devote all our efforts to contributing to the war. Conversely, if we cannot complete the victory of the war, or delay the completion of the war, then the construction of Greater East Asia cannot be completed, or will be delayed. However, in addition to devoting all their efforts to contributing to the war, the Greater East Asia countries are also striving for progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects, which is also a way to cultivate war power. Therefore, efforts in construction and efforts in war are complementary. The day the Greater East Asia War is won is the day when the construction of Greater East Asia is completed and co-existence and co-prosperity are achieved.</p>
<p>Q: Now that the forces of Britain and the United States have not been completely eliminated, then the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has not yet been realized. How should it be thoroughly implemented in the future?</p>
<p>A: The forces of Britain and the United States have already suffered serious blows in the two years of the Greater East Asia War. However, the enemy's dream of aggression for more than a hundred years has not yet been awakened. At the same time, those who have always sucked the fat of the colonies to prolong the life of their own country also regard it as a life-and-death struggle for the enemy Britain and the United States. Therefore, they are still trying to make a last stand with their remaining forces. However, recently, after the Allied forces bravely counterattacked and gave the enemy the United States an even greater blow in the battle of the East China Sea in Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy has reached the point of exhaustion. However, at this final juncture, we cannot underestimate the enemy, and we should be even more fearful of the ancient训 of "building a mountain, the work is lost for lack of one basket". We should intensify cooperation with the Allied forces to finally defeat the enemy, and then we can realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>
<p>Q: Our country, China, is not yet unified, and overall peace has not yet been achieved. Isn't the responsibility for the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration even more difficult?</p>
<p>A: China is an important link in the Greater East Asia region, and it should bear a great responsibility for completing the Greater East Asia War and completing the construction of Greater East Asia. Unfortunately, within the country, there is still Chongqing, held by the British and Americans, dragging on the war and consuming each other. Therefore, overall peace has not been achieved. However, standing in the position of the Greater East Asia countries, we feel that the responsibility is even greater. The government can only start with doubling the innovation of politics and improving people's livelihood, and after the people love the government, the government is strengthened, and overall peace can be achieved, and the Greater East Asia responsibility can be shouldered. In this way, we will not fail the noble mission of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.</p>

Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, who is staying in Japan, is also scheduled to give a broadcast speech.

<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): Japanese Prime Minister Koiso and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu sent telegrams to President Wang and Foreign Minister Chu to extend their congratulations on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The original telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Koiso's Telegram to President Wang</p>
<p>"On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, I extend my deepest congratulations to Your Excellency and your nation. I am immensely gratified as this minister. Looking back on when the international war spirit was strong, the Greater East Asia Conference was convened, and this declaration, which clarifies to China and foreign countries, was adopted at the conference. It is truly a great charter unprecedented in the history of Greater East Asia. The one billion people of Greater East Asia are all paying attention to this historical expression of great intentions, and from the bottom of their hearts, they are awakening a common determination and belief. At present, the war situation is intensifying, and enemies are attacking friendly allies. The Empire is fighting bitterly with arrogant enemies with its incomparably powerful army and navy, and hopes to defeat them. The Greater East Asia War is a sacred war that determines the eternal fate of the countries of Greater East Asia. The great cause of Greater East Asia liberation and prosperity is the lofty responsibility that we should shoulder today and cannot leave to our descendants. Under the belief that we will win, the Empire expects the alliance with your country to become more and more solid. The common ideals expounded in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration will become a beacon of light radiating the construction of Greater East Asia. With one heart and one mind, we will cooperate with each other and advance towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Minister Shigemitsu's Telegram to Foreign Minister Chu</p>
<p>"On the occasion of the joyous first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, this minister expresses his deepest congratulations to Your Excellency and is immensely honored. In this autumn of intensifying war, this declaration can be tested and concretely realized as a norm for the Greater East Asia War and construction, and the pace of building a new order in Greater East Asia is also advancing rapidly. I am deeply pleased that the alliance between the Empire and your country is becoming increasingly strong, and I look forward to the gradual realization of the purpose of the Greater East Asia Declaration, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War with a brilliant victory."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, Allied Prime Minister Koiso and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu sent separate telegrams to President Zhou and Foreign Minister Chu of our country to extend their congratulations. Recently, our President Zhou and Foreign Minister Chu sent replies, respectively. The two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>President Zhou's Telegram to the Japanese Prime Minister</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Koiso, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, I am deeply grateful for Your Excellency's telegram of congratulations. Recalling that on this day last year, your country convened the Greater East Asia Conference, gathering the leaders of various countries in Greater East Asia to jointly resolve and issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, which was truly an unprecedented grand event in the history of Greater East Asia. Now that the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, your country's loyal and brave soldiers have annihilated most of the enemy American mobile units, which the United States boasted of as the honorary units of the Pacific, in Taiwan and the Philippines. It is the greatest victory since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. The victory must belong to us in the future, which can be predicted. We will advance bravely based on the ideals of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and vow to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War together with your country. I hereby reply with a telegram of congratulations, and wish Your Excellency good health, Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China, acting as the president."</p>

<p>"Minister Shigemitsu, on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, I am deeply grateful for your telegram of congratulations.

<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): The Japanese government previously discussed various policies to thoroughly strengthen the support for military personnel.

(4) Promote the idea of supporting military personnel. (5) Strengthen the organization of supporting military personnel. (6) Study other measures, quickly grant various graces, ensure the family life, and fulfill the greatest responsibility to protect their families."</p>
<h3>Main War Situation of the Week in Various Places</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): The main war situation of this week is as follows: (1) On the Japanese mainland, at around 1:00 PM on November 1st, several enemy aircraft (all four-engine aircraft) invaded the Tokyo airspace. This raid by enemy aircraft was based in the Mariana Islands and was mainly for reconnaissance purposes. At the same time, it can also be regarded as the enemy's actions before the election in the United States, and it is necessary to be vigilant in the future. (2) In the north, the number of enemy aircraft raids has totaled 28 times since the end of October. (3) In China, (A) the Japanese army units preparing to fight in Guilin launched a general attack on Guilin, which was being defended to the death by the 131st Division, 170th Division of the 31st Army of the Chongqing Army, and a part of the 188th Division of the 75th Army, on the 29th. On November 1st, they had broken into the northern parking lot of the city. In addition, the Japanese army launched an attack from the south, cutting off the Chongqing army's retreat and compressing the encirclement of Guilin, launching a fierce attack. In the south, the Japanese army is currently preparing for the next stage of the battle in the Pingnan, Jiangkou Market, and Guiping areas. (B) In air operations, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China has been bombing the Chongqing army bases for days, destroying the Chongqing air force and cooperating with ground operations. On the 29th, they launched a surprise attack on Enshi Airport, destroying 11 Chongqing aircraft. On the 30th, they attacked Laohokou, destroying its ground facilities separately. (4) In Burma, the rainy season has passed, and the enemy's air and land counterattacks are gradually intensifying. In particular, the enemy's air force's attempt to disrupt the rear supply in the Yangon area, the movements of enemy ships in the direction of Ceylon, should be paid special attention. (5) In the Philippines, the battles for the capture of Leyte Island and Samar Island have become increasingly fierce. The air battles on the Taiwan Sea, the naval battles on the Philippine Sea, and the sorties of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps (up to now have reached several times), have actively given the enemy's air force a blow. It will be clearer day by day that the air force forces cooperating with the Philippines have recently increased sharply, while its carrier-based aircraft have almost disappeared. Only the B34 aircraft and other land-based aircraft that departed from the coast of New Guinea are responding to the operations of the local area and frequently attacking. The enemy's air battle has passed the greatest crisis, but the enemy has invested five divisions of troops in Samar and Leyte Island, and it is not allowed to be passive. Various means are being used to transport aircraft from the rear to the front line, and at the same time, they are trying to ensure the base in that area, to rectify and assemble the remaining air force. The strong Japanese army troops are fiercely counterattacking, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. The local air supremacy and the trend of the land battle are extremely important. (6) In the Central Pacific, the enemy air force's relay bases, Peleliu and Morotai Island, have become increasingly important as the battle in the Philippines progresses. On Morotai Island, the Japanese Air Force responded to the land operations, and since October 16th, they have raided the enemy's airport day and night, destroying many of the airport's facilities. In addition, the torpedo suicide squad of Lieutenant Commander Hirabing and others in Palau disrupted the enemy's communication lines. The suicide squad led by Lieutenant Colonel Endo successfully landed on the north coast of Peleliu and launched a fierce battle. The enemy is now working harder to rectify the bases in the Mariana Islands, and is planning to disrupt the Japanese mainland, but the elite of the Japanese Air Force launched a surprise attack on the enemy's airports on Saipan and Tinian on the 3rd before dawn, destroying them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Continues to Seize Air Supremacy in Leyte Island; Naval Aircraft Sinks Enemy Cruiser</h3>
<p>The initiative in the Pacific decisive battle has now been completely in the hands of the Japanese army, which is a major change in the war situation. The US Navy must consider the future operation methods of the Japanese Navy. Due to the several attacks by the Japanese Navy, the US Navy's attack power has long been low. In particular, there is no organized battle for the enemy's mobile units, and its aircraft carrier forces are on the verge of reduction, which cannot be concealed. In the Philippines, the enemy's air force is also extremely weak, and carrier-based aircraft rarely sortie. The bombing of the various islands in the area has been carried out by large and medium-sized aircraft in the past. Recently, small and medium-sized aircraft have been used, which is also an expression of the enemy's suffering. Since Guadalcanal, the Japanese army has given up its passive defensive stance for a year and nine months, and has begun a major strategic offensive in the entire Pacific region. It has inflicted a crushing blow on the enemy's mobile units in the Leyte area, continued to seize air supremacy, and thoroughly bombed the enemy's only air base, Morotai Airport. At the same time, they also bombed Saipan, Tinian, and Peleliu. In addition, the Japanese army's land troops also dared to land and carry out hand-to-hand attacks. In Palau, the Japanese army reconnaissance aircraft teams were also gradually active, monitoring the enemy's situation. In short, the Japanese army is increasingly aggressive. At the moment, the decisive battle in Leyte Island is still continuing. The Japanese army's counterattack lineup on the island is extremely complete, and a remnant battle against the US landing forces is about to begin.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): Since the enemy troops landed on Leyte Island, they have been engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles with the Japanese garrison on the island. The Japanese land forces launched fierce attacks on the four main enemy troops that invaded Tacloban and the vicinity of Talak, inflicted heavy damage, and gradually reorganized the battle line to the west. At the moment, they are continuing to advance to the 7-kilometer highlands west of Tacloban to the 18-kilometer Leyte Mountains west of Talak, crossing the Leyte Creek Valley, and the 10-kilometer battle line is preventing the advance of the superior enemy troops. The fierce battles have been going on for days, and the Japanese army has killed or wounded 4,500 enemy soldiers and generals. At the same time, they launched fierce assault battles on the Tacloban, Talak, and San Pablo airports that have fallen into enemy hands, destroying more than 20 enemy aircraft. In addition, a Japanese army unit still ensures the Katamon Mountain position deep in the enemy's陣地, and the coast 8 kilometers north of Talak, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces. The Japanese aircraft team also responded to the brave battles of the Japanese land forces, and repeatedly bombed the enemy airport, landing points, and enemy ships in Leyte Bay day and night. At the same time, they searched for enemy troops in the nearby sea, causing enemy ships to suffer blows. The enemy troops have suffered great losses due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese army. Therefore, they are continuing to replenish transport ships in Leyte Bay in order to complete the supply of land troops and the landing of airport materials, and are planning to take a big step in landing troops. At the same time, they are working hard to rectify the airport in the bridgehead. At the moment, the Japanese army in that area has advanced from the battle between the enemy carrier-based air force and the Japanese aircraft team to the destruction of the enemy's aircraft carriers. On the 2nd, the enemy army gathered about 150 aircraft at Tacloban Airport. On the same day, about 50 aircraft were reinforced from Morotai Island in the evening, and it became a powerful air force with 200 long-range aircraft for a while. The Japanese air force's defense is also more strict. From that night to dawn on the 3rd, they launched a fierce attack on the enemy, destroying more than 100 enemy aircraft and setting fire to more than 10 airport facilities. That night, they also raided the enemy airport in San Pablo, causing two land facilities to catch fire, destroying one searchlight, and bombing the landing point near Talak. At the same time, they hit an enemy transport ship, causing it to catch fire. The Japanese army in that area is still fighting fiercely, and its morale is strong.</p>
<p>Philippine base, 5th (Central News Agency): The Japanese naval air force raided Talak Airport on the 1st night, causing 12 places to catch fire. On the morning of the 2nd, they fiercely attacked the enemy ships in Leyte Bay, sinking one enemy cruiser.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Tightens Encirclement of Guilin, Captures Pingle Using Flanking Tactics</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Guangxi Front, 5th: The battle for Guilin has reached its climax. The Japanese army's encirclement ring has a radius of twenty kilometers, and the entire Guilin basin is now under Japanese control. Another Japanese unit, coordinating with the main force, captured Pingle through flanking maneuvers and surprise attacks, completely disrupting American preparations for war in southwestern China. Initially, the Japanese army launched a final assault on the 17th and 19th Armies north of Guilin. Simultaneously, another unit occupied Sukaiwei on the Liuzhou highway on the morning of the 2nd, cutting off the road and compressing the defeated remnants of the Chongqing 93rd Army, 16th Army, and 10th Division into the narrow area south of Guilin. Yet another Japanese unit launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing New 19th Army near Liangfengwei, south of Guilin, from the evening of the 31st. As a result, the entire southern side of the Guilin basin has been subdued by the Japanese, turning Guilin into an isolated city within the encirclement. Furthermore, other Japanese units, coordinating with the encirclement, seized Pingle, eighty kilometers south of Guilin, late on the 1st. The area east of the Guijiang River is now completely under Japanese control, causing the Chongqing 26th and 37th Armies, as well as the remnants of the 20th Army, southwest of Lipu and Pingle (twenty-five kilometers), to collapse and flee one after another.</p>
<p>Japanese Vanguard Closes in on Wuxuan</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on the South China Japanese Front, 5th: The vanguard of the Japanese army, suppressing the Chongqing army's stronghold in the Liuzhou River basin, is now approaching Wuxuan, a vital stronghold where Chongqing-stationed American air force base is located and also defends the key point of Liuzhou.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the South China Front, 5th: In an attempt to recapture Guiping, the Chongqing 64th and 46th Armies have been holding the high ground west of Guiping since the 20th of last month. The Japanese army on the south bank of the Xijiang River launched an annihilation campaign against them on the 31st and are still pursuing the defeated remnants. They also captured Guixian, a vital stronghold defending Liuzhou, on the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Battle for the Balkan Supply Line Intensifies, German Forces Advance Like Battleships Amidst Giant Waves</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Southeast European German High Command, 5th: Huitong News Agency reports: Fierce fighting is taking place along the Balkan supply route. The German forces in Greece began withdrawing several weeks ago and are now several hundred kilometers away from Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia, in Serbia. After the fall of Belgrade, traffic on the Morava River was cut off, and the German forces are now fighting for the land supply lines west of the Morava River. This highway starts from Skopje, the capital of Macedonia, passes through Pristina, Mitrovica, Kraljevo, and then turns west through Uzice and Visegrad to Sarajevo. At Mitrovica, another highway leads northwest through Novi Pazar, Pljevlja, Visegrad to Sarajevo. Soviet and Bulgarian forces are trying to prevent the German retreat, while guerrillas in Albania and Montenegro are also stirring. Tito's forces are advancing towards Mostar, the capital of Herzegovina, with their final target being Sarajevo. The entire Balkan region is mountainous with no fixed front lines, and the German forces are advancing like battleships amidst raging waves.</p>
<p>Wartime Budapest – A Bleak Scene</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Budapest, 5th: Huitong News Agency reports: Budapest is shrouded in the specter of war. Soviet aircraft circle overhead, and the sounds of anti-aircraft guns and artillery are incessant. Refugees pass through the city in all kinds of vehicles. Cars rush across the bridges over the Danube River. German military police direct traffic at intersections, and the city presents a bleak scene. Residents are staying indoors unless necessary, and only in front of food stores are there lines of customers. Wartime Budapest no longer has the luxurious life of the past. The sound of marching boots is constant in the streets, and German "Tiger" tanks rush to the front lines. Soviet aircraft strafe the city, and air raid alarms sound frequently.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Tokaido Coast Repelled</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 5th: From 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM on the 5th, four American B-29 bombers intruded into the Tokaido area. After a fierce counterattack by the Japanese air defense forces, they fled without dropping their bombs.</p>

<p>Special Commemorative Issue for the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration</p>
<h3>Construction in the Countries of Greater East Asia</h3>
<p>— Compiled by the Newspaper's Research Department</p>
<p>One year ago today, the representatives of the six countries of Greater East Asia convened a conference and issued the Joint Declaration. From that moment, the one billion people of Greater East Asia acquired a grand charter for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. That is to say, the one billion people of Greater East Asia have expressed their determination to defend East Asia with iron solidarity and to build East Asia based on morality, thereby contributing to the establishment of world peace.</p>
<p>For centuries, a world history centered on England and America has from now on changed to a new face and opened a new page. For the past year, the one billion people of Greater East Asia, under the guidance of this Joint Declaration, have united as one and worked together to accomplish their common goals.</p>
<p>The issuance of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is not only the loftiest, most righteous charter for building East Asia, but also a supreme guideline for building a new world. On this anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we should more clearly grasp the global situation, redouble our efforts, accelerate our advance to carry out the war, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia's co-prosperity. The current state of production and construction in the various countries of Greater East Asia is outlined below:</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>On January 9th of last year, China, based on the spirit of sharing life and death with its ally Japan, resolutely declared war on England and America. At the same time, Japan implemented a new policy towards China, providing sincere assistance. On October 30th, it concluded the epoch-making "Japan-China Alliance Treaty" with China, supporting China's revival and construction. On November 5th of the same year, China participated in the Greater East Asia Conference and, on the 6th, issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration with other countries, establishing the policy of completing the construction of Greater East Asia. Since then, it has strived to increase agricultural production, develop resources, and promote various wartime construction projects based on the established policy. This can be described in terms of Central China and North China.</p>
<p>Central China</p>
<p>The construction of Central China, centered on the Central China Development Company and fifteen related companies, concluded the first half of the current year on September 30th and entered the second half on October 1st. Reviewing the main trends in the first half of the year, the content of each company's business can be summarized in the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Establishing a system for strengthening combat power.</p>
<p>(2) Adjusting state policy companies and vigorously promoting the trend of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>
<p>The main points of the business goals for the second half of the year are to continue the unfinished matters of the first half, namely:</p>
<p>(1) Rational operation of the combat power enhancement system and concrete implementation of various production increase plans.</p>
<p>(2) Strengthening the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation trend that has already understood the purpose of adjusting state policy companies.</p>
<p>The Production Increase System of Each Company</p>
<p>In accordance with the aforementioned measures of the Central China Development Company, the other fifteen companies have also changed their systems separately to suit the current situation. Currently, there are seven companies related to enhancing combat power, namely, the Central China Mining Company and Huainan Coal Mine, which are responsible for developing underground resources, the Central China Railway, China Shipping, Inland River Shipping, and Central China Transportation, which are responsible for transportation, and the Central China Water and Electricity Company, which is responsible for the power sector. The business of these seven companies in the first half of the year all moved in the direction of super-priority production increase. The Central China Mining Company and Huainan Coal Mine adopted a on-site priority approach, and the emergency production increase plans adapted to the needs of iron, manganese, copper, and coal have been implemented as planned. Furthermore, the discovery of new mineral veins and the development of new businesses are not allowed to be rushed. Centered on the Central China Drilling Association, test drilling is carried out in various parts of Central China, and new mineral veins are discovered one after another. The development is currently being planned, and some sites have already begun mining and achieved considerable results, which is truly gratifying. The Huainan Coal Mine plays an especially important role in supplying the original power for Central China's industry. Related to the recent coal problems, its trends are extremely noteworthy. In the first half of this year, a true coal mining system has been completed, which greatly helps adjust the coal supply and demand. As such, the Central China Mining, which owns more than ten mining sites, is in fact supplying the important underground resources needed by Central China above the plan. The Huainan Coal Mine is also rapidly strengthening its production increase system in response to local needs, so great expectations are placed on these two companies.</p>
<p>The effects of increasing production are demonstrated by the transportation sector. Under the absolute requirement to increase the transportation of increased production materials, the Central China Railway and other four shipping-related companies are concentrating their efforts on strengthening transportation capacity. The Central China Railway currently has 1,311 kilometers of railway and 3,060 kilometers of highway. It is now focusing on restoring and strengthening various operating equipment, and increasing the number of vehicles and locomotives to increase the land transport of coal from North China. It has also begun building the Jinhua-Jingjiang riverbank section and the Jinhua-Wuyi section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, all of which were completed and opened to traffic in the previous period. In April of this year, it also took over the Bengbu-Xuzhou section of the Tianjin-Pukou line transferred from North China, separately increasing transportation, which will greatly contribute to enhancing combat power.</p>
<p>Central China Transportation is also an integral part of Central China Railway, undertaking the task of increasing transportation capacity. On the other hand, China Shipping and Inland River Shipping, two water transport agencies, are also striving to smooth the transportation of the Yangtze River basin and river navigation. Currently, the length of the routes of these two companies has exceeded 3,000 kilometers. The transportation of underground resources is of course important, but agricultural materials produced in the peaceful and fertile fields of Central China are also fully transported through these routes. As for the Central China Water and Electricity Company, it has overcome the coal problem, resolutely reduced electricity consumption by 50%, implemented priority power distribution for important industries, and adjusted its supply and demand relationship. In addition, Central China Electric Communication has established necessary measures to strengthen the communication network linking Greater East Asia. Public utilities organizations such as Central China Aquatic Products, Greater Shanghai Gas, Central China Match, and Central China Bus are planning measures to increase production and rationalize distribution. Others, such as Shanghai Hengchan, are also steadily promoting the operation of new enemy property companies and the implementation of part of the Shanghai urban plan.</p>
<p>North China</p>
<p>North China is the logistics base for the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is becoming increasingly important as the war intensifies. However, the various materials necessary for increasing the production and transportation of important materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How to overcome this limping situation and lead to victory in construction is the new task for the 19th year of Showa. The focus of this year's economic policy for developing North China is on light metal industry and steel manufacturing, followed by increased production of coal and iron ore.</p>
<p>The focus of the steel manufacturing business in the 18th year of Showa was on completing the construction of special smelting furnaces transferred from Japan, which has generally completed 90% of the planned target. The focus of this year is to fully complete these special smelting furnaces and start construction.</p>
<p>The preparation of the steel manufacturing business and the increased production plan for its raw material iron have also been decided. In the 18th year of Showa, the actual production situation of iron ore in North China and Mengjiang was about 70% of the plan, which cannot be said to be a good result. This is due to insufficient materials and technology. This year, in order to break through this bottleneck, an understanding has been established between the Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation, and the materials, technology, and capital of Manchuria Industrial Development Corporation will be introduced into the company, thereby strengthening the connection between North China and Manchuria.</p>
<p>Regarding light metal industry, the North China Light Metal Industry Company is at its center, and the local preparations are proceeding according to plan. If the machines ordered from Japan can be delivered on schedule, products may be released this year. The local manufacturing of aluminum and the increased production of its raw material bauxite shale are also the center of this year. This increased production plan has been implemented since February, and the power and labor are complete, thereby carrying out the government's increased production orders.</p>
<p>Again, talking about coal, which is the driving force of all heavy industry. There has not been a large increase in quantity compared to the previous year, but considering the reasons such as the lack of materials, the plan for the 19th year of Showa is not necessarily an easy business to complete. The focus of this plan is on ensuring the planned quantity and preparing new coal storage facilities. For this, a considerable amount of secondary funds have been released in the budget. In addition, the increased production plan for the prison, or the use of prison breeding chemical industry, and the preparation of coal liquefaction business, are also important business policies of this year.</p>
<p>Japan</p>
<p>Under the decisive battle phase, Japan's important tasks are to thoroughly strengthen the domestic situation, quickly increase combat power, and devote all manpower and resources to the war. As Prime Minister Koiso announced at the 85th extraordinary session: (1) To raise the will to fight and have a firm belief in victory. (2) To increase combat power and make the war situation develop favorably. (3) To increase food production to stabilize the lives of the people. (4) National mobilization, one hundred million people, regardless of age, work hard to complete the missions they are responsible for. (5) To strengthen defense and minimize losses. (6) To mobilize science and technology and quickly turn scientific and technological power into combat power.</p>
<p>Focus of Production</p>
<p>To support the domestic system, Japan is implementing a decentralization system, placing production at the focus "Hokkaido," "Tohoku," "Kanto," "Tokai," "Hokuriku," "Kinki," "Chugoku," "Shikoku," and "Kyushu" and other nine regions, each with a local administrative council. Each region, based on its particularity, is gradually promoting implementation with the powers transferred from the central government. The strategy to strengthen the domestic system is to maximize the comprehensive strength, to perfect air defense and other various measures that directly affect the implementation of the war, to increase production, and to increase the military strength of the land, sea, and air forces.</p>
<p>In short, to unite the one hundred million people in the country in spirit to complete the war. Looking at each region separately, the Hokkaido and Tohoku regions are increasing agricultural production. The Kanto region (including Tokyo) is strengthening the production of all sectors of agriculture, commerce, and industry. The Hokuriku region, because the area is an important bay, is focusing on maritime transportation and increasing agricultural production. The Kinki region, with Osaka and Kobe as its center, is focusing on expanding the munitions industry. The Chugoku and Shikoku regions are focusing on strengthening maritime transportation. Kyushu is focusing on mining and steel manufacturing, and has a great mission.</p>
<p>Korea</p>
<p>Two Major Granaries</p>
<p>Japan has Korea and Taiwan as its two major bases. Korea, the logistics base of the Greater East Asia, in terms of its production, is both a granary for the Japanese mainland and a multi-faceted industrial zone. The production volume of both items in 1940 was 2 billion yen for agricultural production and 1.9 billion yen for industrial production, which can be said to be a combination of agriculture and industry. The actual harvest of Korean rice in 1942 was more than 15,687,000 stone. The total harvest in 1943 was about 18.7 million stone. The following rice increase plan is currently being implemented: since 1942, a total of 750 million yen has been used to improve cultivation methods and reclaim land, so that in the year of completion (1955), the former will increase production by 5,187,000 stone, and the latter will increase production by 6,196,000 stone, for a total of 34,636,000 stone</p>
<p>The industrial development of the Korean peninsula has been a recent event of the past 12-13 years, and its foundation lies in the development of hydroelectric resources. That is, after the discovery of abundant electrical power by changing the method of the North Korea-Russia border river Tumen River basin, the development of the Yalu River followed, so there is today's multi-faceted heavy industry development.</p>
<p>Inseparable from Korean industry is underground resources. The iron mines in various parts of Korea, led by Hamgyongbuk-do and Musan, have reserves of several hundred million tons. Its importance goes without saying, that is, for graphite, fluorite, barite, mica, and manganese, Korea is also one of the world's leading producers. These not only meet local needs, but also rely heavily on the Japanese mainland. The percentage of dependence is 100% for tin, 100% for graphite, 100% for mica, 96.8% for fluorite, 83.3% for tungsten, 74.1% for lead, and 62.2% for asbestos. In addition, rare element minerals are constantly being discovered and are now being rapidly developed. Important deposits of zirconium ore (Zircon) have now been discovered in various places. As for production increase results, in September and October 1942, fluorite has reached 150%, tungsten has reached 130%, and other lead, asbestos, etc. have all achieved amazing results.</p>
<p>Taiwan</p>
<p>Taiwan is an island of only 33,000 square kilometers, but geographically it is the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with a population of about 6.5 million. Taiwan has always been regarded as a granary for rice, sugar, and tropical fruits, but the rapid development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has changed Taiwan's character and has become an important military, economic, and transportation base.</p>
<p>Taiwan used to have only agriculture, and industry was secondary. Since 1939, industrial production has exceeded agriculture. In that year, industry was 46% and agriculture was 44.4%. In 1941, industry was 47.5% and agriculture was only 41%, but most of the industry was the production of the food industry.</p>
<p>Taiwan, in the decisive battle phase, is advancing rapidly towards increasing production and cultivating combat power. The conscription system has been implemented throughout the island in order to defend the homeland, complete the war and construction.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo</h3>
<p>Manchukuo's development policy was born under the great concept of distribution, relocation, and adjustment of the Japanese nation within the Greater East Asia Sphere, and it is rapidly solving the immovable national policy of Japan and Manchukuo as one, striving to increase the production of major food supplies to strengthen the economic cooperation relationship between Japan and Manchukuo, and becoming an increasingly strong fortress to defend the north in order to expand the military alliance's national defense system. The most recent trends in the development policy are in the two points of colonial policy and striving to increase production.</p>
<p>That is to say, the actual colonial achievements of the first five-year plan (1937-1941) were 46,877 households of developers, and 54,378 members of the Youth Volunteer Corps moved to Manchuria (they can become independent and establish their own household after three years). (Planned target was 100,000 households, budgeted implementation plan was 85,886 households), and the achievements far exceeded the budgeted implementation plan. This year is the third year of the second five-year plan (1942-1947). According to the colonial plan, there must be 220,000 households of developers and 130,000 members of the Youth Volunteer Corps.</p>
<p>In addition, the ordinary labor service corps from Japan have been harvesting excellent results since the establishment of the labor service farm. There are already 17 large farm organizations, but this year 8,000 members have been mobilized, and 39 new farms have been established, cultivating more than 15,000 hectares. The self-sufficient farms of powerful companies and groups in the country also plan to develop 120,000 hectares of arable land this year. The above is the whole picture of the development policy. The development policy has also suddenly changed to a production-first principle due to the Greater East Asia War, and has also absorbed a large number of farmers due to the decision of the Outline of the Comprehensive Mobilization Plan for Development and Production Increase, with extremely complicated and intricate appearances.</p>
<p>In the industrial sector, the production of coal, iron, oil shale, aluminum, tungsten, and other wartime essential materials is gradually increasing, and abundant forest resources have also begun large-scale summer logging, and the construction of wooden ships is gradually advancing. In short, Manchukuo is now using its full capacity to move towards the path of completing the war. In the past, Manchukuo was a raw material production site for coal, iron, etc., in a simple industrial form. Today, it is mobilizing its abundant power resources, and the electrochemistry industry is rapidly rising. Aluminum production is steadily advancing, and it is growing from a primitive raw material production site into a modern industrial country.</p>
<h3>Thailand</h3>
<p>Thailand was one of the first countries to participate in the Greater East Asia War. It is located in the central part of the Indochina Peninsula, bordering Malaysia to the southwest, and is known as the granary of the Malay Peninsula and India. Its position in the Greater East Asia War is extremely important. The country has an area of approximately 520,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 14.9 million, of which overseas Chinese account for as many as 2.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of Thailand's total population.</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the war, the Thai government has put forward six major policy guidelines in the Greater East Asia War, which are (1) to uphold the independence of legal rights, finances, and economy; (2) to maintain public order and prevent crime; (3) to promote the economic welfare of the people; (4) to establish equal rights for the people; (5) to effectively protect the legitimate freedom of the people; (6) to popularize national education, in order to get rid of the semi-colonial status of the past and realize Thailand's freedom and independence.</p>
<p>The most important product, rice, has an annual output of 38 million stone, of which 40% can be exported to supply the countries of Greater East Asia, and its quality is better than Saigon rice. Secondly, such as teak and malin from the mountainous areas of the northeast, especially the latter is the main shipbuilding material. Thailand's production accounts for about 65% of the world's total production. In addition, rubber, a military raw material, and elephants, an auxiliary transportation tool, tin, the first-ranked mineral, as well as gold, silver, copper, iron, manganese, antimony, beryllium, zinc, asbestos, mercury, and rubies, are all well-known.</p>
<p>The Thai government implemented a reorganization in August of this year. Under the leadership of the new Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, with the strong support of the People's Assembly, it is implementing a new wartime policy. In terms of internal affairs, the propaganda policy has been renewed, the requisition of labor for non-military projects has been prohibited, the long-standing evils in officialdom have been eliminated, and the people's spirit has been raised. In terms of diplomacy, it maintains close contact with its ally Japan. In terms of economy, it is working to suppress prices and revitalize private industry. It has also launched a youth movement to unify national consciousness.</p>
<h3>Burma</h3>
<p>On August 1 of last year, Burma officially declared its independence. The 16 million people of Burma, freed from the shackles of Britain for fifty years, are engaged in revival and construction under the leadership of State Head Ba Maw. The first priority is to consolidate the unity of the various ethnic groups in the country. The Taungthu, Kachin, Chin, Arakanese, and other border ethnic groups are all included in the new nation of Burma. At the same time, various emergency facilities are being implemented, such as the construction of roads and freighters, the construction of bridge marks and dikes, and the revival of railways. Hundreds of thousands of people have worked tirelessly day and night, sweating to do the work.</p>
<p>Burma's rebirth can be seen in all fields, and the same is true in industry and economy. In the Irrawaddy Delta area, which is called Burma's treasure house and is the center of its economy, the financiers who used to exploit the farmers in one area have now been completely eliminated. The People's Bank and the recently established National Bank of Burma have replaced them. Burma, which has long suffered from the rampant presence of Indian capital backed by Britain, now possesses its own national bank, which is an epoch-making development. The significance of establishing this financial autonomy is to return many fertile lands to Burmese farmers, which further increases the brightness of Burma's future.</p>
<p>The new policy of the Burmese government is to realize Burma's economic self-sufficiency. Various measures are focused on autonomous and self-sufficient industries, with the aim of transforming the country from a colonial-type distribution and production country into an independent and autonomous producing country.</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, especially to ensure food and daily necessities, the Burmese government plans to cooperate absolutely with Japan. Cooperation in the military field is even more significant. It has now supplied 800,000 laborers to cooperate with the Japanese army day and night.</p>
<p>At the same time, State Head Ba Maw recently also assumed the position of President of the "Greater Burma League." The League is a purely national organization whose purpose is to mobilize the total power of the people and raise the people's will to fight in order to complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Philippines</h3>
<p>Since October 14th of last year, the Philippines officially declared its independence and became a republic, leaping from the dark hell of a former American colony into a bright new world.</p>
<p>Under the leadership of President Laurel, the new Philippines is sparing no effort in preparing its politics, strengthening its domestic situation, and revitalizing its economy.</p>
<p>The national economy of the Philippines is entirely based on agriculture. Before the war, approximately 80% of the total export value of agricultural products was shipped to the United States. This economic structure, dependent on the United States, is now gradually improving. The center of its economic construction must arise from providing the resources required to maintain and carry out the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the order of material development depends on its urgency. The first priority is to obtain mineral resources. At the same time, given its geographical conditions, it is necessary to first engage in the cultivation of fiber resources such as cotton and ramie. Under American rule in the past, the development of mineral resources focused on gold mines. Now, the focus has shifted to important minerals such as copper and manganese. Maintaining the mining areas and restoring the equipment are also urgent tasks at present. Mining areas producing copper, manganese, and iron ore have already begun excavation. Other copper areas are also actively restoring their former appearance.</p>
<p>Regarding the plan to increase cotton production, for example, on Luzon Island at the end of 1942, planting was successful on about 60% of the planned area.</p>
<p>In order to prepare national strength to cope with the decisive battle, various emergency measures are being taken, such as restricting transportation, evacuating the population, and rectifying ideology. As President Laurel said, "Our current urgent task is to maintain peace and order within our territory. From now on, if there are any evildoers who hinder our reconstruction plan and threaten the existence of the Republic, they will be our public enemies." Recently, the enemy Americans attempted to invade the Philippine coast and have been met with fierce resistance.</p>

<h3>The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration November 6, 1943</h3>
<p>That each country in the world finds its place, supports each other, and shares the happiness of universal prosperity is the fundamental key to establishing world peace. However, Britain and the United States seek only their own prosperity, oppress other countries and other nations, especially in Greater East Asia, where they engage in aggression, exploitation, and their ambition to enslave Greater East Asia, fundamentally undermining the security of Greater East Asia. This is the reason for the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the countries of Greater East Asia should cooperate with each other, strive to complete the Greater East Asia War, free Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and safeguard its self-defense. Based on the following principles, build Greater East Asia to help establish world peace:</p>
<p>(1) The countries of Greater East Asia shall jointly ensure the stability of Greater East Asia and build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality.</p>
<p>(2) The countries of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's autonomy and independence and strive for mutual harmony to establish the amity of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>(3) The countries of Greater East Asia shall respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation to promote the culture of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>(4) The countries of Greater East Asia shall cooperate closely on the basis of mutual benefit to promote their economic development and increase the prosperity of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>(5) The countries of Greater East Asia shall promote friendship among all nations, abolish racial discrimination, promote cultural communication, and open up resources to contribute to the development of the world.</p>

<p>Telegram to Youths Nationwide Calling for Peace</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Corps, the 70,000 members of the Fourth United Brigade of the Chinese Youth Section on the anniversary of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration on November 6, sent a telegram to youth compatriots nationwide, calling for unity to achieve comprehensive peace, so as to achieve unified construction internally and independent autonomy externally. The words were sincere and moved all who read them. The full text of the original telegram is excerpted below:</p>
<p>"To all youth compatriots throughout the country: Under the current serious situation, youth compatriots must be extremely distressed. Everyone's wishes are felt to be under tremendous pressure. Where is our freedom and liberation? Where is our independent autonomy? A century later, we have reached a crossroads of life and death. Whether we live or die, survive or perish, depends on this last step! From the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, the future of the Chinese nation once revealed a glimmer of dawn, but after a short time, this dawn gradually dimmed and almost disappeared. After the success of the Northern Expedition, our future revealed another glimmer of dawn, but soon after, this dawn was obscured by darkness. What is this darkness? It is the warlords' partitioning, the politicians' antics, and the tyranny of corrupt officials, which brought about a state of division and the intensified aggression of imperialism, and even brought about the eight years of tragic war between China and Japan. Since the founding of the Republic of China, our common people have only one demand: to unify and build internally, and to be equal and free externally. Whoever plots to divide us is our enemy, and whoever treats us unequally is even more so our enemy. Now is the time when we need unity most urgently. Without unity, we cannot unify and build internally, and we cannot get rid of the shackles imposed on us by imperialism. Japan is at war with Britain and the United States and has driven British and American forces out of East Asia. What will we do? This is the most urgent and also a glimmering turning point. Will we rise up to fight for liberation? Or will we allow Britain and the United States to occupy our country and use it as a battlefield? Or will we maintain our original inferiority and continue to be obedient citizens of the sub-colonies, no matter who wins or loses? Since the beginning of the peace movement, Japan's policy towards China has undergone a tremendous change. Since the Sino-Japanese Alliance on October 30th last year, Japan has shown its sincerity in treating us as equals, and has signed in the Alliance Treaty that 'The Japanese state agrees to remove its Japanese troops stationed in the territory of the Republic of China when a comprehensive state of peace and war ends between the two countries', and further agrees that 'The Japanese state will relinquish all stationing of troops based on the Beijing Protocol and related documents of the Boxer Rebellion', to resolve the disputes between China and Japan. If Japan does not withdraw its troops, it will be difficult for China and Japan to achieve peace, but if Chongqing does not want peace, it will be difficult for Japan to implement the withdrawal of troops. This is the most important key, which manipulates the overall peace between China and Japan, and can even determine the entire destiny of the Chinese nation. What should we, youth compatriots of the country, do?</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is an expression of Japan's equality with us, and the Greater East Asia Declaration is a guarantee of mutual respect for sovereignty and integrity among East Asian nations. Now that we have the reality of East Asian national liberation and the Japanese promise in the treaty, what are we waiting for but to quickly achieve comprehensive peace, seek unified construction internally, and achieve independent autonomy externally? Moreover, the eight years of war have only created opportunities for the Communist Party to expand its power. If we allow it to drag on, the disaster for the country and the nation is truly unimaginable! Youth compatriots, the precipice of life, death, and prosperity is already ahead. Rein in the horse quickly! We unanimously appeal: Demand the realization of comprehensive peace! Demand unified construction! Oppose the landing of Britain and the United States in our country, using our country as a battlefield! Demand true freedom! Demand true liberation! Demand true equality!"</p>
<h3>Prices of Major Food Items Last Week: The Rising Trend Has Not Been Curtailed; Market Conditions in Finance, Industry, and Commerce Are Generally Stable</h3>
<p>The market conditions in finance, industry, and commerce in this city were much calmer last week than in the previous week, with transactions being lackluster. The financial sector did not experience much prosperity or decline, because the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has formulated implementation measures in accordance with the provisions of the outline for strengthening the business of financial institutions in Shanghai Special Municipality promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and has begun to handle the work of strengthening financial institutions. Especially for the lending business of financial institutions, it has been decided to implement inspections from now on, and they must operate in accordance with the law and must not exceed the limit of 3 million yuan. Therefore, various industries have been restricted by this limit and are no longer as rampant in lending as before. The money market has become looser, and the state of financial inaction seems to have decreased. Speculators cannot use funds for activities. The market has always been sluggish and has not recovered. In terms of industry and commerce, the Municipal Economic Bureau has begun a city-wide expanded inspection of warehouses, hoarding goods, and selling them at lower prices to stop the wind of rising prices. However, the rising trend of major food items in the world has not been curbed. For example, the market prices of rice, oil, and miscellaneous grains have risen more than they have fallen. The authorities are paying close attention to and cracking down on this situation.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Adjusts Salaries and Allowances for Police Officers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau has, in accordance with the method of adjusting salaries and allowances promulgated by the Municipal Government, formulated a method of adjusting official ranks and salaries, which has been implemented since September 1st. The formulated adjustment method uses the official ranks of simplified appointment grades 1 to 8, assignment grades 1 to 12, and commissioned grades 1 to 16, and the base salaries are multiplied according to the newly revised methods of the central government, and the first and second types of allowances are given. The first type of allowance is determined based on the difference between the current treatment of the bureau's personnel and the newly revised method of the central government. Because the current treatment of the bureau is higher than the newly revised standards of the central government for those with a base salary below 140 yuan, the second type of allowance is set to make up the difference, so that personnel below 140 yuan will not be lacking the current payment figures. As for the salaries and allowances of the former Public Works Bureau police officers, they are issued in accordance with the method of adjusting the salaries and allowances of all personnel of the Municipal Government. The salaries and allowances of the former Bureau of Police officers are changed according to the regulations of the Municipal Government's adjustment table, and the amount exceeding that table from the original salaries and allowances is issued as an acquired special benefit, and the total amount of income must not be reduced. However, the special benefits of the former Bureau of Police officers are fixed at the income at the end of August, and will not be increased thereafter. Therefore, the treatment of the former Bureau of Police officers after the adjustment is commensurate with the total amount of salaries and allowances previously received, and the treatment of the former Public Works Bureau police officers has been increased in accordance with the adjustment method.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Tricycles Scheduled to End on the 10th</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities began strictly inspecting all operating tricycles in the city last month. Most of the work has now been completed. Matters such as poor brakes, leaky canopies, or light colors on the vehicles have been corrected and ordered to be repaired for re-inspection. It is now known that the inspection of various vehicles is scheduled to end on the 10th of this month.</p>
<h3>Tax Office Adjusts Tax Rates on Tobacco and Alcohol</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to adapt to the wartime tax system, has gradually adjusted the tax rates of various unified and special taxes, and tax revenue has increased sharply compared with the past. Now, the tax rates on three items, namely local tobacco, local wine, and smoked tobacco leaves, should also be adjusted. It has now been decided that from the 3rd of this month, the tax rates on the above three items of local tobacco, local wine, and smoked tobacco leaves will be increased by two times the original valuation, and an additional 200 yuan will be added to the two times. The department has issued a notice to the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provincial stamp tobacco and alcohol tax bureaus to comply with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Judicial Personnel Allowed Temporary Allowances</h3>
<p>The judicial personnel of various levels of judicial organs in this city have been approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration to allocate temporary allowances to promote the gradual stabilization of the lives of the personnel. The Shanghai Higher Procuratorate specially ordered its subordinates yesterday to look up to the Ministry and its intentions in the future, to work hard in their respective positions, set an example, and establish judicial discipline. After receiving the order, the District Procuratorate immediately forwarded the order to all its personnel to comply with it uniformly.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Holds Discussions on Tax Collection in Various Districts</h3>
<p>In order to effectively rectify tax revenue in the city and understand the tax collection situation in various districts under its jurisdiction, the Municipal Finance Bureau convened a meeting of directors of tax collection offices in various districts of the city a few days ago. Director Yuan presided over the meeting, and in addition to listening to the tax revenue situation in various districts, he gave detailed instructions on intensifying collection to enrich the treasury.</p>
<h3>Owners of Absentee Real Estate Should Apply Promptly</h3>
<p>Since its establishment under order, the Housing and Land Management Committee for Absentee Owners in this city has actively handled matters such as the registration, transportation, and disposal of houses and land owned by absentee owners in various districts of the city. It is now learned that the Shanghai North District Office of the committee, in order to urge general owners or landowners to cooperate with applications as soon as possible so that results can be obtained sooner, earnestly hopes that owners will not take a wait-and-see attitude, or conceal information and violate government orders.</p>

<h3>A Discussion of Buddhism at the Bodhi Society</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>In the sunset glow amidst clear waves, golden light flies over Taiye Lake!</p>
<p>White poplars lament the day's end, grey dogs transform into wondrous clouds!</p>
<p>Desiring to visit the Bodhi abode, first pay respects to the Jade Buddha's form.</p>
<p>The Brahma's mystical shadow is distant, within the universe, please listen for the dharma's hour.</p>
<p>The above quatrain of five-character regulated verse was composed by me this afternoon (October 18th) when I went to the Bodhi Society in Beihai Park, at a tea stall near the Jade Emperor Bridge. It truly expresses the feelings I had at the time. Why did I go to visit the Huangdao Bodhi Society? The important thing is not whether I believe in Buddhism, but because it bears an extremely noble mission. Perhaps everyone is aware that they indeed have the possibility of undertaking that noble task! So what kind of organization is the Bodhi Society? On the surface, it is merely a Buddhist society that studies Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, but in fact, if there are sufficient talents, it is a working organization for communicating Chinese and Tibetan culture. Tibet is not a foreign country, but it holds a special position within our country. Not only because of its unique customs and traditions, but also because it possesses a cultural heritage – Buddhist studies. Although Buddhism originated in India, the spirit of Buddhist research is now mainly preserved not in India but in Tibet, within our own country.</p>
<p>Lay Down the Butcher Knife and Become a Buddha</p>
<p>The president of the Bodhi Society is Mr. Tang Zhuxin, who can be said to be the only politician in our country who is devoted to the study of Tibetan language and philosophy. If readers are not too forgetful, they should know that during Yuan Shikai's era, there was a Hunan military governor named Tang Lianming. Zhuxin is the great name he adopted after laying down his butcher knife and immersing himself in Buddhist studies. The reporter made a special visit to the society upon his introduction and was deeply honored to be received by the society's instructor, the Tibetan Lama Sai Chi Shangren. Originally, the two characters "Bodhi" originate from Sanskrit and mean "enlightenment." The group who are devoted to Buddhist studies and are proficient in Tibetan, besides Mr. Tang, also include Zhou Shujia, Liu Pengyi, Yang Daguang, and several others. In the year of the Sino-Japanese War, they established this society in front of the White Pagoda in Beihai Park, Beijing, based on the meaning of Bodhi. At that time, one of the founders was also Anqin Husi Ketu from the rear of Tibet. Therefore, relying on donations from enthusiastic individuals, they renovated an ancient temple into a magnificent structure. Today, amidst the lake's reflection and the mountain's light, it truly appears even more ancient and elegant.</p>
<p>Gazing at the Buddha Images, Wisdom Springs Forth</p>
<p>Every person who enters Beihai Park from the south gate and walks straight north, passing the bridge, will see the pagoda standing above. In front of the White Pagoda, one will see the four characters "Bodhi Society," which originally came from the hand of Tang Zhuxin. According to Mr. Tang, the establishment of this society is truly a great pleasure in his life, which shows that he truly has the will to make the communication of Chinese and Tibetan culture his lifelong career. He has now translated many Tibetan classics, all of which are published by the Bodhi Society. When the reporter went to visit, Mr. Tang happened to be there reciting sutras. He asked a fellow enthusiast to accompany me and point everything out. In the main hall, they enshrine the Buddha statue of Master Tsongkhapa. Although I am an outsider to Buddhism, I truly felt the wisdom of all beings upon entering its doors. It can be known that Buddha is just another name for wisdom! Opposite the main hall, there is also a Buddha hall, which enshrines the Tathagata Buddhas of the three times (including the present, past, and future), but that hall is smaller. When the lamas perform rituals, they are all held in the main hall. To the west of the main hall, there is another instructor's chamber, where I met Shangren Sai Chi.</p>
<p>Shangren Sai Chi grew up in the front of Tibet. When you see him, he resembles the Dalai Lama seen in pictures. I think most Tibetans look like that. Before the incident, once when I was traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing, a bald man wearing a Western suit suddenly sat opposite me in the compartment. At that time, I thought he was Japanese because he seemed to speak Japanese (because he could speak Japanese). Later, when I spoke to him in English, I learned that he was Tibetan Tuden Sangjie, the representative stationed in Beijing. He originally went to Shanghai to welcome a large Geshe (similar to a Ph.D.) who had recently arrived in Shanghai from Tibet. He also looked like that! However, this instructor felt especially kind! It is said that this Shangren can know the past and the future, but he does not speak lightly in normal times, so I had no way to find out. Although he has been in Beijing for seven or eight years, his Mandarin is perhaps not very fluent, so it was not very easy for me to converse with him. Fortunately, Mr. Yang Daguang was at my side, and he sometimes explained things for me, so I understood everything.</p>
<p>The Four Major Precepts: Killing, Stealing, Adultery, Lying</p>
<p>After coming out of the instructor's chamber, I also asked about the content of the Bodhi Society. It is said that they now have about 300 members, including male and female members. They have established a free clinic in Beijing and also run Tibetan language classes in the society. Many young students come to learn Tibetan, but generally, they do not have perseverance, so there are no achievements yet. Before the Great East Asia War, they had people coming and going to Tibet to transmit scriptures, but now they are completely isolated from Tibet. They hope to have great development after the war and contribute a small amount to the future of the unification of the motherland. Their greatest precepts are four, namely: killing, stealing, adultery, and lying. These are also the precepts of Tibetan Tantric Buddhism.</p>

<p>Today, those who ride public vehicles generally fall into three categories: first, working people who are rushing around for life - including workers, merchants, doctors, teachers, etc.; second, occasional temporary passengers - including housewives, shoppers, those going to entertainment venues, visiting friends, and others; and third, students - including junior high, high school, and even university students. Among them, students account for about one-quarter of the total number.</p>
<p>Before the war, it was difficult to see students on public vehicles, but after the war, schools themselves are overwhelmed, and there are few dormitories to accommodate students, so most students are day students. However, apart from elementary and junior high schools which are located in every alley, the rest of the higher-grade formal schools are mostly located in remote areas, some in the far northwest, and some in the bustling streets of Nanjing Road and other major buildings. In short, most are far away from residential areas. Walking, of course, requires time and ability. Bicycles are certainly the only advantage for commuting at the moment, but the huge price of cars has exceeded the purchasing power of the general public. Therefore, the ultimate solution is to rely on trams (mostly) and public buses.</p>
<p>Calculating roughly, it costs about ten yuan per ride (including distance, near and far, pre-eighth district, pre-first district, trolleybus, tram, public bus, single ride, and borrowing a car). On average, about three times a day (there are morning and afternoon classes, and half-day classes), then you have to pay 30 yuan a day for the ride, and 810 yuan per month, calculated for 27 days (excluding Sundays). Each semester has five months, costing a total of 4,050 yuan (about 80-90% of the tuition fees). A monthly pass in the pre-entry area costs 1,000 yuan, and half price 500 yuan for those under 16. With such statistics, the number is indeed alarming.</p>
<p>Students are different from ordinary passengers. One is engaged in production; the other is engaged in consumption. Certainly, this huge expense is undoubtedly added to the parents' burden, but it indirectly creates a factor of lost young people. Imperceptibly, it increases the number of future illiterates in China and establishes an expected layer of weakness. For the sake of these many interests, I have no choice but to appeal to the vehicle companies. I request that the authorities be able to consider the facts of reducing student fares with their abilities and establish other preferential measures. For the company authorities, this small amount is no different from drinking from the river, not worth worrying about, but for the students, it is already a profound benefit and gratitude. At the same time, it also invisibly removes a layer of "city foxes and society rats" in China.</p>
<p>Suggestion for Drawing Lines at Bus Stops Zhan Hong</p>
<p>Recently, due to the gradual scarcity of vehicles and the sudden overcrowding of passengers, there has been a practice of queuing at bus stops and boarding in order, which is convenient and well-intentioned. However, the current implementation method is still flawed. For example, at some bus stops, there are many customers, and the lines are too long, so they are repeatedly staggered. In addition, they are allowed to line up freely, and passengers often feel the same. It is often difficult for others to feel the end and do not know where to line up. Especially for first and third class, there are no obvious signs, and it is not easy to distinguish them, so they often line up incorrectly. By the time they realize it, it has been a long time, and then they have to line up again from the beginning, which is extremely inconvenient! Moreover, perhaps because there are too many people, there is no such experience. They stand right in the center of the road, stepping on the tracks, and only run away in a panic when the car comes. This not only obstructs traffic but also causes danger!</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the tram company should delineate reasonable boundaries according to local conditions. Use blue for first class and white for third class so that people can follow them without making mistakes. In this way, the tram company spends very little, and the passengers benefit greatly.

<h3>Thoughts on the YMCA Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>The YMCA has been established for 36 years now. The expenses for the association's work have always been raised from the community, based on the principle of "taking from the community and using for the community." Because of their hard work and relevance to the actual needs of the society, their annual fundraising campaigns always easily achieve their predetermined goals.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, the soaring prices have affected the entire charitable or relief work in Shanghai. The YMCA naturally cannot be an exception to this economic hardship. The expenditure for their work increases every year, while the general economic capacity of the society seems to decline year by year. According to the needs of their work, their expenditure for next year will require at least eight million yuan. It is said that they will be carrying out this eight million fundraising campaign starting this month.</p>
<p>The number "eight million" seems quite huge. However, if we understand and recognize the work of the YMCA, we will feel that this is the minimum need. The YMCA's work covers a wide range, and the objects of their service include all levels of society. The most important and basic work includes two nurseries, one children's home, and four free schools. There are also general work such as women's family life guidance, academic lectures, various talent training, labor relief dormitories, winter clothes... Nurseries, children's homes, etc., are all relief in nature, or at least require partial subsidies. At present, it is very difficult to maintain a normal education institution, let alone the YMCA, which includes so much work!</p>
<p>At the same time, we feel that the most important point is that the YMCA's fundraising is essentially different from general charity fundraising. Their work is cultivating the young generation and the new generation, and the meaning is very positive. Therefore, we feel that this time, the YMCA's huge amount of fundraising will still seek the support and familiarity of many righteous people in the society. We want to help the YMCA complete this fundraising campaign. We want to make their many valuable and meaningful jobs continue to benefit society and people as much as possible. (Haiyan)</p>
<h3>Save the Suffering Children</h3>
<p>The other day, I went to the Holy Mother's Nursery in Xujiahui. The nun led me to visit various departments. The order was orderly, which is a role model in the cause of caring for children. However, five hundred orphans are waiting to be fed. After returning from the visit, I felt sad, so I made a special note of it. I hope that the enthusiastic people in the society will show great compassion and teach and raise the suffering children, which is what I hope for. (Ye Xinfo)</p>

<p>Zhang Huimin's Dental Clinic Provides Free Treatment</p>
<p>Dentist Zhang Huimin, in view of the fact that initial tooth decay is often delayed, resulting in serious illness, especially in children, will set up a civilian children's department in his clinic at 176 Nantong Road every afternoon, charging only 50 yuan for material costs. For adult medical care and children's tooth extractions, no additional fees will be charged, and poor patients will be completely free. It is hoped that early treatment can restore health and save the trouble of plating and extraction. The time is economical, both are benefited, and the benefit to health is even greater.</p>
