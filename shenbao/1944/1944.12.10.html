<h3>日空軍繼續猛攻沉毀艦船十七艘　陸上部隊突入布羅音機塲</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午四時三十分發表：攻擊雷伊泰島奧爾莫克附近敵艦船中之日軍航空隊，十二月七日於巴帕海面擊沉小巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，於奧爾莫克上空擊落敵機十架，是役日機自炸未歸還者計十三架。</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日大本營九日下午三時發表：（一）雷伊泰島布羅音西方地區之日軍陸地部隊，六日晨突入敵戰綫內，當日夜與高千穗降落傘部隊之奇製相呼應，突入布羅音南北敵機塲，與當地敵軍戰鬥中。又突入其他敵機塲之高千穗降落傘部隊，似收得極大戰果。（二）十二月七日晨，的一師之敵於雷伊泰島西岸阿爾別拉附近開始登陸，日軍航空部隊當即出動攻擊敵艦船，同時陸地部隊亦對敵邀擊，與之激戰中。航空部隊收獲之戰果中，經判明者如决：特別攻擊隊護國及一宇飛行隊，擊沉大型運輸船一艘，擊毀起火者大型運輸船二艘，艦型不詳者二艘，其他之航空部隊轟沉運輸船一艘，擊毀驅逐艘三艘，大型運轍船一艘，登陸用舟艇多艘。（三）日特別攻擊隊勤皇飛行隊，十二月七日攻擊雷伊泰灣內敵艦船，擊沉戰艦一艘，運輸船三艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地九日中央社電　日機神風特別攻擊隊，八日猛攻雷伊泰島西方海面美艦隊，其巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘中彈爆發而沉，同時神風隊其他部隊亦與此相應繼續攻擊，然刻下尚未接到戰果之報告。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地九日中央社電　雷伊泰美軍，以增援軍自卞加拉灣急速進擊奧爾莫克，然由於馬那嘎那方面敵第三十二師及第二十四師之苦戰，其企圖已歸潰滅。又由雷伊泰東海岸擬向哈羅，塔加米西方高地前進之敵第七，第九十六師，機械化第一師等，亦於六日夜由於日軍陸上部隊呼應空挺隊勇行突擊，已將其完全阻止。因戰力削弱，雷伊泰全局之敵軍焦慮益甚，因之，敵軍更使第七師一部由巴帕進至答姆拉安，用盡手段，企圖確立奧爾莫克灣之優勢，但日軍對此北上敵軍，七日於答姆拉安予以痛擊，敵軍先鋒已被阻於該地，然敵軍爲期戰綫有利，現於該方面使水陸兩用戰車等登陸，拚命圖挽回頽勢。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　麥克沃塞司令官八日發表：（一）七日於奧爾莫克灣展開之海空戰，美驅遂艦一艘，小型運輸船一艘爲日空軍魚雷沉沒，（二）日急降轟炸機隊，於民答那峨海面擊沉美中型貨船一艘。</p>
<p>日各特攻機隊猛攻筆艦詳情</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日高千穗降下部隊，製入雷伊泰之敵飛行塲後，雷伊泰島之戰鬥，乃更趨激烈，日軍特別攻繫隊在此壯舉前，五日曾大舉出動，猛攻徘徊於雷伊泰周邊之敵艦船羣，除七日發表之石腸隊戰果，擊沉艦船一艘外，現又判明萬朶機隊之一機，曾擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，一宇機隊之三機，更曾擊沉輸送船三艘，僅此一日，日軍產隊即沉毀敵艦船十一艘，其奮鬥經過，大體如下：萬朶機隊中之一機，果敢衝入雷伊泰灣之敵艦陣，猛然對敵軍之戰艦或巡洋艦之大型艦心臟部，作勇敢之直衝，敵艦當即轟然震響，同時起火傾斜，推測不久即巳沉沒。鐵心機隊之三機，於雷伊泰灣東方搜索敵艦，突發見撒爾安島西方有護衛艦掩護之輸送船團，該三機利用浮雲，冒敵猛烈防禦砲火，衝人敵艦上空，排成一字陣形，一齊突入船團，斯時日掩護機漸與敵邀擊隊展開激戰，故未能確認戰果，僅將日機衝鋒之瞬間印入目中。又是役日掩護戰鬥機一架一去不復還，七日攻擊雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，約一時許，雖未確認戰果，其後據海軍部隊之報告，一字機隊中之三機，曾各向敵運輸船團作俯衝攻擊，確實擊沉敵船三艘</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍　防衛嚴密　木村指揮官談</h3>
<p>仰光九日中央社電　緬甸方面日軍最高指揮官本村氏，當大東亞戰爭三周年之際，發表談話如次：客歲以來，敵曾以英美蔣聯軍等謀打開中印陸路運輸路，一方幷擬犧牲印度民衆，奪回緬甸，此外，更補强印度洋艦隊，欲由海上侵攻，然因緬甸日軍之防衛嚴密，敵之企圖已歸失敗，緬甸國內練力，最近愈益堅固，自由印度臨時政府亦積極充實戰力，日派遣軍之士氣愈爲高昂，必勝不動之信念愈爲堅決，以此强靱之籍神，必能使緬甸國安如磐石。同時，並竭力援助自由印度臨時政府，達成其素願，今在敵實行總反攻之前，果敢採取攻勢，以期由東亞永久除去英美之存在，爲達成此目的，日緬印三國務須同心戮力，相信相扶，以敢死挺身之精神，一致向前奮鬥。</p>
<h3>秉承先輩鬥魂　防衛菲律賓　山下大將對國內廣播</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　於雷伊泰前綫指揮三軍忠勇兼備之日軍最高指揮官山下奉文大將，八日晚特於烟硝砲火之第一綫向國內廣播，其內容大意如决：最近自臺灣海面，菲律賓東方海面及雷伊泰島決戰，以及對摩羅泰·塞班各地之攻擊，我陸海空軍均獲莫大戰果，實不勝慰快之至。我軍以少數之兵力，對恃以物量與優勢機動力之敵軍，而能獲得此等戰果，究其所以，實係秉我傳統之拼死精神所致。日人今後必須秉此精神，同時，本人亦秉此精神，向擊滅敵人之任務邁進。譬如我方以一人駕駛之戰鬥機，與素稱空中要塞之B29相拼撞，則爲一對十，以一機對敵之空母或戰艦相拼撞時，則爲一對千或對萬，其效果之大，實無倫比，即能以此精神向前雅進，擊潰以物量自恃之敵人，並非難事。如培里琉島之激戰，已兩月於茲，此間敵雖以數師兵力繼續攻撃，但已受重大損失，此實係由我軍拼撞精神所致。本人任務旣在防衛菲律賓，今後定堅獲之偉大戰果，並常以此培養精神，使之日益向上。菲律賓過去於太平洋上雖僅係一面積有限之島國，但比較上乃係一大島，且有可以左右轉動之自由，本人絕對秉求先輩遺留之鬥魂，舉所有力量，將敵擊潰。</p>
<h3>襲滿渝美機歸途遭截撃</h3>
<p>中國基地九日中央社電　日軍航空部隊，七日對來襲滿洲之渝美B29型機於其往返途中加以截撃，擊落其二架，擊毀其三架。</p>
<h3>日機轟炸遂川機塲</h3>
<p>中國前綫基地九日中央社電　日航空部隊轟炸隊七日夜攻擊遂川機塲，停留塲內之小型機三架及機種不明者一架中彈起火，並擊破另外一架小型機，又機塲沒施一所發生大爆炸（半確實），滑走路被毀，日機安返機地。</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>期待於大東亞戰爭的第四年</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭的三週年紀念日已經去了，現在正踏入戰爭的第四年。我們於紀念三週年之餘，當第四年開始的時候，似還不能不提出幾種感想和體騐，從作第四年努力的指標。</p>
<p>第一種是感覺到和體騐到於彊塲作戰之外生產戰的重要。敵美妄圖挾其龐大的生產力，壓倒別人，但不甘落後的盟邦日本，年來急起直追，努力從事於飛機爲中心的增產，已獲得巨大的成績，從而得以配合前綫作戰的需要，摧毀頑敵。爲澈底擊滅敵美的野心，今後我們實應更加特別努力於此。</p>
<p>第二種是感到不論在戰塲上及生產上，民力的偉大。前綫作戰的盟軍士兵及戰地盟邦日本僑民英勇戰績和犧性精神，其所以能驚天地動鬼神者，實全賴偉大民力的發揮，而盟邦日本軍需生產的突飛猛晋，也何嘗不是以偉大的民力爲基礎。中國自亦應效法盟邦發揮巨大的民力。</p>
<p>第三種是感到政治運用的決定性之大。盟邦日本之所以能够這樣發揮民力物力，得力於健全的政治指導很大；反之，中國許多事情之所以迄今還是不能完美，民生日苦，政治不健全實非常有關。所以改善政治乃是發揮中國力量的要道。</p>
<p>不過以上三點中，我們應努力的最基本的對象，似還是在於第一點生產的增强。發揮民力和政治的最主要的目標，也就是要促使生產發達，俾以較多的經濟力量，協助盟邦貢獻於大東亞戰爭。而在現實條件，中國在大束亞戰爭中所應並所能担負的重要的責任，也即在於提供物力。</p>
<p>中國資源豐富物力雄厚，如能進一步加以開發，更合理的動員起來，我們相信其有助於大東亞戰爭的生產戰，必然非常巨大。然而很遺憾的，我們過去的努力，實覺不够。汪主席曾詔示今年爲生產年，呌我們多多從事增加生產，事實上我們有沒有完全去做呢？觀於最近各種生產，有的不僅未見增加，且有衰退的趨勢，我們實在太慚愧。現在大東亞戰爭第四年已經開始，我們應如何加倍致力，以補前幾年的不足，充分增强大東亞戰爭中生產戰的助力</p>
<p>過去我們似乎太側重表面，而疏於實踐。祗有空洞的生產委員會，硏究會，討論會以及代表大會之類，議案雖多，計劃雖大，却大半都是空泛不實，言而無行的，最後仍然置諸紙上了事，眞眞做到的，委實過少。今後我們務必實事求是，重實踐而不徒敷衍表面。定計劃一定要考慮做得到，而可以做得到的計劃，一定要貫澈實踐。</p>
<p>我們最好把大東亞戰爭的第四年定爲增產實踐年。應求生產的眞眞增大。增產的對象，自以軍需爲第一，但民需如此窮乏的現在，增大民需生產，也屬急不容緩，願中日當局一併注意及之。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭三週年　全國各地隆重紀念　發衆情緒至激昂</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　昨（八日）爲大東亞戰爭三週年紀念之日，値此戰局進入決勝階段之時，逢此紀念日之來臨，意義實深重大。除首都政軍警民及靑少年各界，隆重舉行紀念行事外，全國各省市縣軍政民衆各機關團體，亦均展開偉大熱烈之紀念節目。武漢三鎭在省府主持下，除省府各廳處局曁省保安司令部省黨部，舉行擴大紀念式外，武昌漢口均舉行擊滅英美民衆大會，武漢在敵機盲炸之餘，民衆情緒益感興奮，誓滅英美之敵氣心，愈益下午舉行民衆大會，宣傳人員全體出動，作街頭演講。北平方面政委會所屬各機關，上午舉行隆重儀式，下午舉行民衆大會，擊滅英美之敵蛋愾氣氛，至濃至厚。天津及徐州開封蚌埠蘇州揚州九江蕪湖安慶等各地，亦均舉行紀念儀式。</p>
<h3>首都昨晨舉行參戰紀念儀式</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社舉行　中央黨部九日上午十時舉行參戰紀念儀式，中央各部會工作同志一律參加，由副秘書長戴策主持，並宣讀參戰布告，爲前錢將士爭取勝利肅立致敬，爲傷病將士康復默禱致祝，爲陣亡將士靜默致悼，情况嚴肅，至十時許禮成散會。</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　國府參戰紀念日，軍委會於上午九時在該會議舉行紀念，參加者張首席參謀，决長以下全體職員百餘人，由張决長主席，並宣讓參戰布告。</p>
<h3>岸情報部長演講　大東亞戰本質</h3>
<p>在首都民衆大會席上</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日駐華大使館岸情報部長，於九日「中日民衆共同決戰大會」中以「大東亞戰爭之本質」爲題，發表演說，茲誌大意如决：日本完遂大東亞戰爭之決意，已表明於宣戰詔書中，大東亞戰爭必須達成之目標，亦已明示於大東亞共同宣言中，余已不必贅言。日本爲排擊英美支配東亞之野心，恢復自已之本來面目，故斷行</p>
<p>明治維新大業</p>
<p>造成此八十年前明治維新的原動力之日本民族的決意以後，即不斷擴大其規模，直至大東亞戰爭，英美物質觀念所不能計算N歷史的道義力量，迭在於此種力量，已形成爲日本戰力之主體，其中有神風特攻隊之精神，阿茲島塞班島等全員玉碎之精神，此精神在日本人視之自極平常，而在英美觀之，則爲一難解之謎。</p>
<p>美國之戰爭目標，究竟何在乎？美國之物質上繁榮，皆由榨取東亞各民族而來，故東亞民族以日本爲先驅，一旦獲得解放後，美國之恣意享受的物慾生活，即將被否定，故無論如何，皆欲犧牲其他民族以維持之。這種</p>
<p>美國戰爭目標</p>
<p>亦即爲美國之戰意。目前雷伊泰島方面之戰局，實極重大，惟現在該島之日軍包圍陣已漸完成，美軍之補給錢即將被切斷，更因日軍傘兵於敵陣强行着陸突人作戰，已使敵軍陷於孤立無援之狀態，唯有降服或被殲滅而已。故今日實爲擊滅驕敵之絕好機會。吾等大東亞民族決心集結總力，完遂保衛東亞解放東亞之戰爭亦即在今日。至於英國，幾已</p>
<p>成爲美國附庸</p>
<p>英國本身深知其爲維持本國覇權之戰爭目的，決不能以與美國共同戰爭所達成，英國之憂慮及苦悶亦即在此，例如印度問題，即爲其憂慮的中心之。其爲渝方呼號之抗戰，究以如何期待之，假定渝方所謂之最後勝利能獲得，則中國民族又有何益乎。中國與印度日本之民族命運，在根本上即不可分離，中國之復興，不僅可引起印度之自覺，由此確保日本之發展，即大東亞之保衛力者，在前提上在結論上爲絕對必要，此爲亞洲民族歷史的必然性。渝共兩方雖不斷高唱抗日民族統一戰綫，但其合作與衝突仍不絕而來，故其究爲合作抑爲衝突之使人迷惑狀態，實毫不足怪。欲謂大東亞戰爭之本質，實有爲</p>
<p>求虎之棄其牙</p>
<p>蓋以爲虎在其有牙，與否定虎之存在，等於要求虎之棄其牙，此事之不能僅由妥協或交涉可成功，實無待贅言，試觀英美兩國前者於又配榨取印度馬來外，復欲中國置其支配下，後者幷唱門羅主義來拒其他國家對美大陸之發言權，一面則自西班牙手中奪取菲律賓，不顧菲人意志加以併合，復於門戶開放機會均等之名義下，欲向中國遂遂其野心，故爲人類之尊嚴與進步，而毅然決然欲打破此種不合理者，即爲日本之向英美宜戰，是以欲對虎說以理論或披瀝誠意，視食肉動物之虎爲食草動物，決無可能。因此次之大東亞戰爭，決不能得到妥協，故貫澈戰爭，作戰到根本斬去虎牙爲止，實爲使虎失去其本質之唯一方法，亦唯有如此，始能期望世界之有眞正的和平與進步。</p>
<h3>保衛東亞總進軍　林宣長前晚廣播演講</h3>
<p>宣傳部長林部長，爲大東亞戰爭三週年紀念，特以「保衛東亞總進軍」爲題，於八日晚十時十分，在中央電台廣播，　其大要如决：在大東亞戰爭三年中，盟邦日本處於前方，抱堅持銳担任前鋒，以快刀斬亂麻之勢，將百餘年來盤踞亞洲的英美勢力掃蕩殆盡，收獲赫赫戰果，處在大後方的中滿泰菲緬印等國。先後在爭取大東亞民族解放的大　下，躍然崛起，以協力的決意，必勝的信念，動員全面的人力物力，共同負起完遂戰爭的責任，也得到了相當的成就。百餘年來，英美帝國主義企圖制覇世界的野心，一無止境，狹其軍事經濟的暴力，積極自東亞伸展，除了已經奮發自强的維新日本未遭茶毒外，其他各亞洲弱小民族國家，可謂無一能避，尤其是在後患頻仍的中國，侵略的魔掌得乘虛而直入。</p>
<p>打開大道爭取自由　汪主席早就看清了這一大危機，所以在中日事變發生之前，就盡力爲之預防，在事變發生以後，更盡力爲之補救，終於毅然決然爲國家爲東亞打開一條中日和平的大道。在和平運動發軔之初，即明白說過：和平運動是完成中國獨立自主的一種進程，是並不另標主義的政治行動，和平還動的最大目標，顯然的仍在打倒英美侵略主義，以解放東亞而求中國之自由與獨立。所以和平運動本身就是國民革命的再出發，也就是繼承國父遺敎，重新把國民革命的路綫納入正軌，使之向更前進之途發展。</p>
<p>繼承遺志勇往邁進　汪主席逝世還不到一個月的現在，適逢大東亞戰爭三週年紀念之期，今天我們全國民衆雖然聆不到汪主席嚴肅懇摯的訓示，但是注主席幾年以來不斷對我們的策勉，如今依然留在我們的記憶裏。和平奮鬥救中國，是汪主席畢生的志願，我們必須使之實現，統一是和平建國的要件，我們必須使之完成。大東亞戰爭是救　中國保東亞的先着，我們必須舉其全力爭取勝利。須知大東亞戰爭是全東亞民族爭取自由解放的戰爭，也就是東亞人共同建設東亞新天地的開始。凡我東亞十萬萬國民，唯有以同甘共苦同生共死的大決心，向英美侵略主義者作最後的殊死戰，英美勢力一天不退出我們東亞，我們誓死與之拼鬥到底。注主席雖已逝世，然而正義的明燈，已在亞洲民族中間輝耀着萬道的光芒，爲我們照澈了一條十萬萬民族奮鬥求存的大道。中國的同胞們，全亞洲的同志們，現在正是到了我們的戰鬥隊伍總進軍的時候，我們携手共進，迎取大勝利的來臨。</p>

<h3>蘇崑虞產米區視察記（四）</h3>
<p>五　配給問題</p>
<p>國府於九月二十七日公佈「蘇浙皖米穀運銷管理暫行條件」，經行政當局實施後，對於上海的影響，是不在本文範圍之內，至於對於蘇省城市及鄉問的影響又如何？經過視察後，結果是這樣的：</p>
<p>城市方面，米糧搬運有受限制，有不受限制二種。受限制的，如蘇州，崑山等地，蘇州郊外運米進城，祗准携帶少量。以致城內米價漲至一萬八千元一石。</p>
<p>崑山爲蘇州地區走私之大門，沿崑山接近縣份山，至於青浦雖本年豐收，因轉運至滬，於是崑山米糧，偸偸由靑浦轉運至滬，偸運方法，利用民船，下爲米袋，中舖油紙，上堆稻草，經軍營查出沒收者，截至目前共爲三五五，四七石，穀爲一七，五〇石；崑山縣府方面，業已出動保安隊警察於蓬聞鎮附近構成封鎖綫，同時食米由鄉間運城，又有嚴格限止，城中富有者，業積儲米穀所成間題者，多爲薪水階段及苦力等，黑市米價飛漲，又無戶口米配給，其處境情况，直得憐憫的。</p>
<p>不受限制的，乃爲常熟城，從鄉區至城內，運米可以通行無限，不受留難，前城內米價一度漲至每石一萬三千元，由米糧公會，議決公佈停止同業交易，立即降至九千元一石左右，民衆均欣歡贊同此等措置。關於此點，記者團曾詢問關係當局，彼謂：「常熟地區處境比較特殊，於其任米走私偸運長江之北，還不若任讓運進城中，况且城中儲藏之米，仍爲常熟人民所食用。」</p>
<p>城間與鄉之米糧搬運限制，其措置或因必要，我等不能加以非雖，但於限止米糧搬運期間，城中並無戶口米配給，則城中居民，以何爲食，何以爲生。</p>
<p>「蘇省城市配給制何日確立？」記者團以此問題，即問省府代表，彼答謂：「關於省內四大城市（蘇州）無錫，常州，鎭江）配給米問題，省府正在計劃中，希於短時期內實現，配給之機構，常與米統會聯絡後，分令各縣指定米商辦理。」</p>
<p>記者團亦以「米糧搬運業已限止，城中居民之民食，如何處置？」詢問崑山縣長，楊縣長謂：「本縣日內正擬開會討論，計劃配給米問題。」</p>
<p>關於蘇省城市配給米，於收買米糧最高潮時，當局似尚未實施，僅以「正在計劃中」作爲答詞而已；實際上倘不立即實施城中戶口米配給，對於收買食米工作，亦有影饗，民衆均儲存食米，致收買工作，遂不能順利進行。</p>
<p>鄉村方面米糧搬運，有在同一地區可自由搬運，有則嚴格實施全部限止搬運，例如常熟第二區即實行後述之方式；但鄰近有非產米區存在，在棉作物地帶農民，產米極少，不敷在食，所產棉花，以公定價繳出，所食米糧，需以黑市價購入、農民生活遂成問題。</p>
<p>關於棉作地帶農民食米問題，理應棉統會，粉麥統制會，油糧統制會，米統會，共同負責解決，其中尤以棉統會，收買棉花時，則有求於棉作物區農民，收買完成後將農民棄置不再顧惜，此種態度有改正的必要。實際上，以上棉，麥，油，米四統制會，各自爲行政，不發生聯繋，希望能於四統制會進行工作間，成立統一性機構，共同負責保護農民，實施重農政策。</p>
<p>物資配給方面，在蘇省除合作社略有配給外，其他機構，並不努力實行，期望當局，能深加注意，因關係民生，亦復重大</p>
<p>六　合作社問題</p>
<p>從事收買米糧工作中，成績最著的，就是合作社，因爲合作社經常在鄉下配給物資，農民對它懷有信心，關於合作社協助米統會收買米糧的形況，從蘇州和崑山兩地，就可以管窺一個大概：</p>
<p>蘇州地區合作社，是直接與農民發生關係，從總社，到各縣分社，到各區支社，經過保的階段，結合成互助社，以互助社爲單位，使農民能瞭解合作眞諦，同時進行收買，增產諸工作。</p>
<p>合作社所擔任收買米糧區域，是由該社經辦農村貸款，肥料，及其他配給區域，結果，農民均踴躍拿出米糧，舉例而言，如吳江區合作社所經辦收買米糧爲指定之四鄉，其他附近三鄉，亦要求爲合作社收買地區，因爲合作社所出的，是正當價格，決不從中取利。（未完）</p>
<h3>洪牙利首都　砲聲清晰可聞　戰事不久將達於頂點</h3>
<p>洪京九日中央社電　海通社訊：洪京已聞砲聲甚爲淸晰，市區交通頻繁，軍隊及箭十字團常通過市街。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：多瑙河西岸蘇軍之大進攻布達佩斯，其大原因爲巴爾幹德軍之向北准進，塞爾維亞西部之德軍亦同時北進，於是蘇軍側翼頗受威脅。普拉登湖與杜那孚特伐間之蘇軍，損失甚重但無進展，由塞員爾島向南攻擊之蘇軍，亦未能突破。哈特文附近局勢未變，經齊拉克進攻多瑙河之蘇坦克車隊，突向南攻擊洪京，但已被阻，其後方交通亦斷。由各方現象觀之，洪京之戰不久可達頂點。</p>

<h3>經濟保安處令飭　各業嚴遵限價　五島處長致詞盼各業協力</h3>
<p>市警察局經濟保安處，前（八）日下午四時，在該局警察俱樂部，召集各業同業公會理事長五十餘人，舉行懇談會，由處長五島茂主持，副處長野口平次郞，第一科長竇志海，第二科畏福田，副科長楊光塵，經濟警察總隊長山本等均出席。</p>
<p>非法營業決予取締</p>
<p>首由五島處長報告，略謂：一本處負有市政府，經濟局，日本大使館經濟政策的執行取締戰務。目前上海經濟問題，頗爲嚴重，有關整個民生，故當局及各界均甚關懷。目前經濟狀况之造成，尚有很多原因，但戰時經濟政策若千權成之士，還未認識淸楚。本來過去上海市塲賣買，是自由而不受任何限制。商人希望物價上漲，蓋越漲越有利可取，但在戰時經濟政策，須顧全整個民生問題，不得圖取暴利，而作違背經濟政策之行爲。本人相信在座各位，沒有抱牟利觀念者，倘有之，則希望澈底糾正。警察當局爲澈底抑平物價，安定民生，對不正規而圖暴利之非法營業，決予嚴厲取締，並望各位在同一目標下，協助當局，督飭各會員工廠公司行號，遵守經濟政策。盡力設法抑平物價。本處成立以來，幾個月中，已有不少工廠商店行號，遭受取締及嚴厲處分，這是各業公會因與本處沒有充分聯絡及協力，但本人不希望有是項措置，在不得已時，惟用警察力量，對不法商人加以處分。本處力量有限，處置種種經濟政策，甚爲困難，故希望各位對會員不正當的行爲，不正規之營業，予以檢舉取締，則本處任務，亦可完成」。</p>
<p>超越限價嚴行法辦</p>
<p>繼而由副處長山口平次郞致詞，略謂：「過去本處與各業公會聯絡不週密，彼此不能得充份諒解，在目前經濟狀况之下，本處力量辦不到的地方，務望各位協力推進。查邇來各公會會員商店行號，申請當局提高限價，而未得核准，而公會當局默認會員擅自漲價，殊不合法。惟原來限價，已不合理，但不能默許會員漲價，均須向當局申請認可後，方得提增售價，否則一律依法罰辦。公會當局應督飭會負嚴遵限價，及遵守當局政治政策。本處對日用品及雜糧，以及其他物品之企圖暴利，而有害民生者，均嚴格調查，予以取締。同時日前本處積極調查倉庫，對不法商人或業外人之囤積，希望各位協力檢學。其他關於本處職員如有不正當行爲，還望不客氣的報告，當以適當辦法檢舉之。」繼而由山本隊長致詞，將經濟警察之任務詳加闡述，並爲澈底取締不良份子，假冒詐欺，難爲商人，希望檢舉。再有福田科長申言過去對不法商人之處置，僅行罰鍰及沒收物品，似乎一般商人尚不關痛癢，故今後對不法商人，須送檢察署引用司法處分嚴辦，最後各理事長對各該業提供意見，當由楊科長竇科長一一解答及接收。</p>

<h3>印主席鮑斯　在華廣播詞　建設新亞洲須中日合作　美利用渝方作對日工具</h3>
<p>日前余在東京，曾應東京電台之請，對諸君廣播，今日又在中國本土，再向諸君致辭，並將前次廣播之要點，略爲覆述。余抵責國後的第一點感覺，即爲貴國汪主席之逝世</p>
<p>深爲哀悼　余固深知吾人之敵，及一部份中國民衆對於注故主席之論斷爲如何，但無人能否認關於汪先生之三項重要事實，筑一，在先生爲孫中山先生之忠實信徒及同志，第二，汪先生爲畢生爲中國國家及民族盡瘁，第三，當汪先生爲良心所軀策，而與其同僚分離時，實具有非常之堅決意志，及自我犧牲。吾人之敵，常以漢奸及傀儡等名詞。加諸其敵人汪先生，勒洛爾總統，巴莫，及余本人等俱被賜以此種稱謂，但上述諸人，如係自私自利，則僅可息影不問世事，或隨波逐流，以求其處由之安適，共所以奮身而起，不顧困難者，無非受最高之　任心及崇高理想之精神所驅策。本其經騐，對於西歐帝國主義，尤其是英美已絕不相信，能援助他人者，僅有日本一國而已。至於蘇聯亦不能與亞洲弱小民族以任何援助，故此輩領袖，不得不接受日本之友誼與合作。一部份中國人士或謂此種對日合作政策，或適宜於印緬菲等國，但中國則仍以對日抗戰爲</p>
<p>適當政策　因此余欲指出以下數點：（一）建立新亞細亞，不能缺少中國，無中國之合作，則任何有利於亞洲之政策，俱無從實現，中國斷斷不能對於亞洲之需要視若無諸。（二）　　　亞細亞，無日本之合作，亦屬不可，若無日本則亞洲有無其他國家可以對抗西方帝國主義國家。中國之潛力雖大，但在未曾統一，未曾工業化，及未曾獲得承認之前，實不能負解放亞洲之重責。照現狀觀之，無日本之援助，亞洲實無法更生，西方帝國主養者之實力，在乎海軍，而亞洲國家之擁有頭等海軍者，僅日本一國而已，如吾人欲反抗英美之侵略，非有頭等海軍之援助不可。（三）英美即使今日對渝方表示友好，亦非有厚愛於渝方或中國，不過因痛恨日本而已。美國對共黨之能一度，亦出於同一之動機，蔣介石將軍實應明瞭此點。美國在其本身利益之立塲上，原反對共產主義，但爲企圖毀滅日本，乃準備姑容共產主義，並鼓勵中國之共黨。（四）英美旣爲自己之利益，而同情於渝方政權及中國共產黨，則自然索取其所給同情及援助之全部代價。蔣介石將軍若爲一政治家，則應消除仇恨及成見，而</p>
<p>正視事實　中國對日本之宿怨吾人皆知，是以在大東亞戰爭發生之前，印度亦同情於渝方，因當時認渝方爲中國之代表及發言人也。迨大東亞戰爭發生後，全部局勢有激烈之轉變，日本政府軍隊及人民態度及政策，亦大爲改變，余若非確信此點，則決不敢妄談中國問題。亞洲不能無中國，亦不能無日本，因此亞洲各國無不願見中日二國締結光榮之條約。</p>
<h3>訊者助學消息　助學金特別勸募　深盼各界速迅推動</h3>
<p>本報篇籌募第八屆助學金，巳自本月一日起發動「特別勸募隊」，目標定爲一千隊，每隊至少兩萬元，以一個月爲限，連日向各界人士，作緊急呼籲，至今天止，已是第十天，而響應者未見踴躍，認隊捐欵的人，也和我們預期的目標，相差甚遠。我們相信社曾有力人士，決不致於袖手旁觀，忍令四千餘優秀淸寒學子失學，而健國家社會蒙受莫大的損失。依目前捐欺的趨勢而言，但已使我們萬分焦急與憂慮，所焦急的，是勸募期間迫促，深恐捐欵不易達到目標；所憂慮的，是興欵不與預算符合，深恐四千餘淸寒學子，下期學費無着，而致學業中輟。綜上兩點，我們純粹爲國家社會打算，想賢明的有力的讀者，定必十分同情，十分贊助；可是同情與贊用力，已不是坐而言，而是起而行了。</p>

<h3>神風攻撃隊忠言錄</h3>
<p>盟邦日本神風特別攻擊隊，以肉彈精神，勇敢赴義，創造空前偉大戰果，使敵人爲之胆落。盟邦駐華體隊報這部鹽田大尉，爲使一般明瞭「神風」隊之言行起見，特作如下之介紹，並加詳細說明。</p>
<p>由關大尉以下四勇士肇始之「神風特別攻擊隊」，別名又稱「必死必中隊」，乃一去不歸之肉彈攻擊隊。今「神風」成掩蔽南海之旋風，大有不滅敵人決不中止之勢。慷慨赴義，已屬古今難德。至如冷靜處事，從容就死，允非常人所易爲。然在神風特攻隊二十餘歲之靑年勇士心目中，旣無所謂榮華富貴，甚且忘却自身，僅知爲君爲國，含笑成仁。諸勇士之心境，因常淡泊，故一旦發動，即如雷霆。此種必死必中之猛攻，允稱日本海軍光榮傳統之表現，而宣揚武威於中外，了無遺憾。</p>
<p>神風特別攻擊隊有左列各隊（僅以其名出現於戰塲者爲限）：</p>
<p>數島，大和，朝日，山櫻，菊水（第一回特攻隊）</p>
<p>忠勇，義烈，純忠，至誠，誠忠（第二回特攻隊）</p>
<p>天兵，梅花，左近（第二回特攻隊以後者）</p>
<p>茲將司令長官暨司令之訓詞，以及勇士之言行摘錄於後，藉見神風精神之一斑。</p>
<p>長官訓詞　「國家興亡，繋於此時此刻。此次太平洋大決戰之勝利，懸於諸子雙肩，望諸君以肉彈捲起神風！茲爲大元帥陛下，並爲吾等祖國之故，本司令長官願得諸子之命。諸子唯一之遺憾，想爲未能得知戰果，然直掩隊之僚機必細觀諸君之戰，而向長宣報告，長官亦必奏禀大元帥陛下，並將戰果告於諸子之靈。故各位無須抱憾，望努力爲之！」（司令長官某某中將對第一回特攻隊之訓詞）</p>
<p>「……至高至上犧牲心之發露，即神國神兵之眞諦。諸君將爲其權化而成神兵中之神兵。諸君乎，其往矣！務祈達到目的！諸君忠勇爲國，義烈純忠，至誠無二，所建偉勳，必能上感天皇陛下。諸君之父母，無論是否尚在此世，必將衷心欣慰。一億國民，亦將興奮感謝。此爲本職深深期待於諸君者。」（某某司令畏官對第二回特攻隊之訓詞）</p>
<p>「神靈乃可敬而不可求者，掀起神風，即在於各位本身之奮戰！」（某某司令之訓詞）</p>
<p>「來吧，大家都來，讓咱們握手！」……「大戰果雖已連絞建立，但敵人還　來哪！多多仰仗你們！這就是咱要說的話。」（某某司令與神風特別攻擊隊員握手訣別時之語）</p>
<p>「現在，年輕的隊員已經都是神靈了！咱早就如此想啦。」（某某司令接獲第一報時之言）</p>
<p>「攻擊目標爲敵軍航空母艦，衝撞時須擇航空母艦之弱點。」（某副長於出發前指示機宜）</p>
<p>勇士壯言　「咱們不是田隊，是炸彈！好嗎，隨咱來！」（關大尉之警句）</p>
<p>「皇國興廢，在站一戰。自此刻起，吾將出發執行捨身攻擊敵人航空母艦之榮譽任務。」（第二回特攻隊某某大尉之中告）</p>

<p>「要有最大的效果而能生還，是很難的。在我們凡人，尤其是困難的事情。不過，我們的任務紙在隨附沒有活的眼睛的炸彈直到正確命中敵艦時止，所以祗要是飛行員，誰都能够幹。」（某某大尉於出擊直前發表之談話）</p>

<p>鹽田大尉說明　（一）日本東鄉元帥任聯合艦隊司令長官時，以「天祐神助」之意，「出書神風」兩字，故「神風」字樣早已刻印於日本國人信念中，日本國民及日本陸海軍對東鄉元帥，備極信仰，尊爲「聖將」。</p>
<p>（二）上文內聯合司令長官對神風特別攻擊隊隊員之訓示及勇士之言行，具間將日本海軍之精神表現無遺。按日本神風精神，古已有之，例如本幕府時代以前，有「源」與「平」兩軍對戰，「源」軍之名將齊藤，年近古稀，恐敵人見及其髮白容衰，不與對戰，故特染髮修各，並着年靑者服裝後出發，類此精神，實乃日本原有精神。</p>
<p>（三）關於袖神風特別攻擊隊之取名，「敷島」與「大和」均代表日本，「朝日」代表太陽，「山櫻」乃櫻花，櫻花於開時則全開，謝則全謝，代表淸白團結振興之意。「菊水」乃菊花，菊花代表日本皇花。前日本南北朝時，帝室力量薄弱，郡國跋邑，時有楠不正茂者，有見及昆。特奮勇打倒郡國後，呈獻菊水旗與日皇。厥後郡兵復起，時楠本已死，由其子繼承遺志，敉平郡亂，亦用菊水旗呈獻。至「忠勇」「義烈」「純忠」「至誠「及「誠忠」，均係效忠天皇而命名。又「天兵」表示天皇之兵，「櫻花」乃日本所敬重之花，「左近」乃皇宮附近之花，均含尊重皇室之意</p>

<h3>修磨</h3>
<p>— 史亭</p>
<p>磨心突然脫落了，用明　膠牢後沒搖幾下又活動了，東家對我說：</p>
<p>「留心修磨人來，喚他進來修一修！」</p>
<p>我的東家是個寗波女人，好脚色可是貪小，隨便那一椿事她都盤算過，怕吃虧，要佔人便宜，我在她那裏做了二個年頭，好容易才學會點她的精明－－放水的時候，龍頭開得很小，半天才盛滿一壺。晚上把煤球搬到房間裏來，免得房客偸用等等，這在她也是難得的事。以前她差不多三個月要換一個傭人，而且常常是「不歡而散」的。她吃好飯，不許將飯桶捧到灶間去，傭人得一碗一碗到裏面來盛，你想，這事情眞使人爲難，她坐在飯桶邊你用小碗盛了三次，明明才塡了肚裏一角，你可不好意思再盛了，她就用遭辦法，無形限止傭人吃飯的數量。我們做活的，不吃飽就不成功，常常飯後偸吃，自然一給她發覺，馬上就吵起來，接着掮上舖蓋滾蛋，這是她常常掉換傭人的最大原因。其决爲着煤球用得欠省，或者洗衣服時把男人的上衣和女人的袴子放在一脚桶裏等等罪狀而掉換，也是常有的事。輪到我在她府上做活，吃的是三號尸口麵粉，苞米粉之類的雜食，吃飯的限止是取消了，我不喜歡調東家，天下烏鴉一般黑，全都一樣，祗要有飯吃，就行了。空的時候，呌我看孩子，磨麥子，苞米粉，也不反對，因此能做一年多，她對我不滿，還是最近的事</p>
<p>且說，有一天，我從街上帶了個老頭子回來，他穿得襤褸，背着一個布袋走起路來拖着破鞋，不大有勁，我想，這老頭兒好久沒人下顧他生意了。</p>
<p>「你會修磨嗎？」我懷疑着，問道。</p>
<p>「不會修磨，你喊我來幹嗎？」好一個刁頑的老頭兒！</p>
<p>我把他領到房間裏，抬出磨子來，他用磨心敲敲，問道；</p>
<p>「『坑磨』吧？東西不肯出來！」</p>
<p>我說：「磨起來很費力！」</p>
<p>「誰說『藏磨』！」東家對我白白眼：「裝牢磨心多少錢？你說。」</p>
<p>「『藏』不『藏』，不干我事。」老頭兒說，打量着，「你這磨子，買來時，多少錢？」</p>
<p>「百塊！」</p>
<p>「那末，就一百塊吧！」</p>
<p>東家跳起來，嫌工錢太貴了，但是修磨人非這些錢不幹，他背起布袋打算走，東家又喚住了他。</p>
<p>「那末再鍛一鍛，一共多少？」</p>
<p>「二百塊！」老頭兒說：「實在說，你這磨子不鍛過，就是裝牢磨心也沒用。」</p>
<p>老頭兒，勸東家鍛磨，東家懷疑他，怕他佔了便宜，於是仍舊要他只裝磨心。</p>
<p>「六十塊吧！」她說：「一百塊買來的，費六十塊修磨心！」</p>
<p>你師母算是！……明　膠一次要多少錢？十塊怕不够吧？然而，磨不到一個磨頭，就脫下來，你這磨就等於租來的。」他走到門口，又折回來，「九十塊好麽？」</p>
<p>「八十塊！爽爽快怏！」東家說。老頭兒答應了，把磨子搬出後門口，開始拿出鐵鎚和　子工作了。</p>
<p>「七十塊，七十塊好嗎？」東家忽然打斷了他</p>
<p>「講好了，你又變卦！」老頭兒將鐵鎚一拌，「你去問問擺年糕攤的阿根，八十塊錢不會呌你吃虧的。」</p>
<p>東家眞的去問阿根，老頭兒咕嚕着，繼續工作。</p>
<p>「像這樣多心的人沒見過！」他說。</p>
<p>「你不知道，她買小菜的時候行麻煩哩！」後了價錢，稱好了她不是　菜不好就是還要人家加兩把，賣菜的不肯，厭她纏不淸，索性呌她別買了，可是她又捨不得，好幾决我見她跟人家相駡！」</p>
<p>東家回來了，她對老頭兒說：「你好好地做，鍛得好一點，出這末多錢，仍舊磨起來費力可不成</p>
<p>老頭兒詫異地問：「你說要鍛一緞？我老早就勸你過。」</p>
<p>「咦！你一來我就和你說裝個磨心，鍛一鍛。」東家尖聲尖氣地說：「你這老頭聾啦。不是講好人十塊裝磨心帶鍛磨？」</p>
<p>「你這個下賤的婊子貨！」老頭兒破口大駡道：「八十塊裝磨心帶鍛磨，我吃了兩萬塊一石米沒事做！天在頭頂，你怕雷劈殺！」</p>
<p>「大餅攤老板，你給我講講理看！」東家說「我這磨子是「藏磨」，不呌他鍛一鍛，我但裝牢磨心有用嗎？」</p>
<p>老板笑着，不說好歹。</p>
<p>老頭兒罵着，對老板說了一遍剛才的經赤，又轉身對着東家：</p>
<p>「你有種一道跪下來罰咒，那一個沒良心撒謊，那一個今天晚上，就不</p>
<p>「你這賊老頭！」東家氣得直發抖：「活到這末大年紀還說謊話，我問過阿根，裝牢磨心要我八十塊，你當我憨大？……你不高興做，你走好啦！」她把磨子拉向門內來。</p>
<p>「呌我走，好便當」老頭兒猛然將磨子拉出來：「我這兩下子白　！」</p>
<p>老頭兒賴蒲不肯走，要喚巡捕。</p>
<p>「給你念塊錢！」東家給他錢，呌我把磨子搬進來。</p>
<p>起先修磨人還不肯休，不讓我搬，後來總算大餅攤老板講面情，他才說</p>
<p>「不是老板講情，非呌巡捕不行。」於是，他收拾起來，拖着破鞋去了。</p>
<p>我將磨子搬進來，東家忽然哭哭啼啼地駡起我來。</p>
<p>「都是你，你領這麼個賊坯來欺侮我，你給我滾！」自費了念塊錢，她</p>
<p>「怨你自己！誰呌你心眼多，講好的八十塊裝牢磨心，你想欺侮他老頭，你不要臉！」我氣得大罵，我知道她早就存心回了我。</p>
<p>「你…你竟敢駡起我來　」她踩着脚：「天地良心，他一來我就呌他鍛磨，裝牢磨心，八十塊錢單裝磨心，我這麼蠢？」</p>
<p>我沒理她，當晚掮起舖蓋走了。</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽　談中北華聯之戰　乙組複賽將開始…增加女子錦標</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽甲組自四日（週一）中北勝華聯後，造成兩隊積分相等。再須重決外，其餘之戰，均告完程。各塲極見順利，殊堪稱頌！乙組六部，分部亦决第圓滿，各部冠軍，已有得主，茲先談談中北華聯之役。</p>
<p>中北華聯大戰收穫至稱滿意</p>
<p>中北華聯之役，因其有吸引力，本報當局爲維持秩序，亦所以厚助學金，乃臨時增價，而熱忱球迷，以欣賞球藝及樂予輸將。於是爭先恐後，造成第一次之熱鬧盛况，且在堪均能維持良好秩序，實爲最大收穫。而兩球隊是戰中，俱在球藝方面力圖發揮，認眞到底，動作淸晰可觀，毫無粗暴行爲。對裁判絕對服從，爲聯賽生色不少。本報感到無限之興奮和快慰焉。</p>
<p>中北突改戰策華聯致受挫折</p>
<p>旣以此賽之精彩，筆者不厭其煩，再追談兩隊勝負關鍵之所在。要亦爲下戰相逢時，彼此作更一進步之硏討。</p>
<p>中北所採陣容，悉如上期拙作。一方面利用人長得高傳遞及刧球之便，一方面亦費盡心血，作對圓之措置。如以趙雅林之拼孔廣益，尤見妙着．蓋孔爲華聯所獲分之要功臣，趙則本不冀有分數者，於是趙任何犧牲可不惜，紙遏住孔之擲籃而已，當易收事半功倍之效。致此次中北之突改絕對人釘人制，初非臆料之中。觀乎中北各戰，均現有長力不逮之象，即採較爲省力之五人聯防術，亦覺鬆懈異常。故上塲之初，果見釘人奇緊，衆料共必不能維持到底。孰謂諸將愈戰而愈勇，以迄於終，能突然一改面目。益以其敏捷之出手，球藝之高超，當屬應獲勝利。論各個演出，確均功多過少，決非其勝而後揚之也。李震中管住勃脫之外，屢覓隙而作攻，難能可貴。李寳中與顯崙之相鬥，亦至矣盡矣。陳學祟有謂其獲分殊少，極爲失望，此實誤解。蓋學祟之目的在關住對方吳成章。吳爲華聯獲球者之靈魂，制其獲球機會，即學崇之成功也。沈聿恭似略疏瞿錫麟，但反之錫麟亦隨之較鬆。以故沈，瞿，獲分均多。聿恭之妙射，究亦應列爲功臣，趙雅林死釘孔廣益，可稱佳作。</p>
<p>華聯陣容亦如拙作。唯其戰術之失敗，不可掩飾，其主因，當決不料中北會採人釘人制，乃步步受其緊逼，措手之間，雖臨時商討改變方法，究以應用未熟，未臻奇效。下决相逢時，當覓各方面戰術之對付，作相當之訓練。則以華聯過去之精神而言，固仍大有原望焉。竊以爲破人釘人，必須用極敏捷極純熟之擋人法，始克成功。在上屆西靑聯賽時，曾爲文言。華聯擋人技術，利用太少。時至今日，可謂其然。再是日下半時換人固對，對注則誤。以范慶公調張顯崙，張良雄調孔廣益，乃取范張二君俱能遠擲，以冀挽狂瀾。然以范看趙雅林，張看陳學崇，想藉混亂對方目標，果屬有理。然趙究爲一犧牲者，是則又豈非犧牲范乎？學祟進攻之時多，良雄又何能得機遠射？不識華聯以爲然吾？</p>
<p>再決今日開會各界要求三賽</p>
<p>兩隊重決，究定何日極爲各方所急於探知。茲定於今日開聯賽委員會，即可決定公佈。又各界頗多具函要求，希望再決時，採三賽二勝制，當爲多希望看二塲好球，其理由則求此爲公正之比賽，分球藝之高下，使雙方各無倖致之心，與怨言之生。倘門票收入增加，淸寒千弟更得實惠。究竟如何，須觀今日委員會之最後決定矣。</p>
<p>乙組六部冠軍複決之期另定</p>
<p>（乙一部）仁餘旣克勁敵驚聲，非但一部冠軍攫取，進而謀總冠軍，亦有希望。其隊員類多曾代表甲組，自爾勝人一等矣一</p>
<p>（乙二部）以大華之一退出，胖隊便拿穩首席，胖將們心曠神怡，雄心不小。共老伴侶董仰峯，新自西子湖畔來滬，聞將返留一陣，則我人自當刮目相視。</p>
<p>（乙三部）靑協有劉荷生之諄諄敎誨，球藝竿頭日進。隊員俱年事正輕，臨陣奮發有爲，旣奪得本部皇座，在複決賽時必求更上一層。</p>
<p>（乙四部）汕隊小將遞承甲組之作風，以快殺稱。在四部中壓倒慕爾一役，允見其實力之發揮。日後之作爲，我人可拭目以觀。</p>
<p>（乙五部）晨友藍五戰五勝，均見順利。觀其成績，似未臻上乘，然戰士經騐充足，謀算多人，故不可經被之隊也。</p>
<p>（乙六部）中北隊，亦有甲組同樣之作風，似見氣力不够，但其逢緊張賽時總有妙手，其豈眞眞中北之作風耶？日前勝伶友，隊員均見賣力。嗣後複決時之臨陣如何，即可觀其成敗。</p>
<p>至於乙組複決賽秩序，將於日內公佈。</p>
<p>女子開始報名希望踴躍參加</p>
<p>在乙組複決賽時，聯賽將女子組插入，所以增興趣，亦爲提倡女子運動。現已開始報名，於十二月十二日截止。希望各巾幗隊踴躍參加，以襄盛舉，則幸甚矣。徵聞綠隊，三省，佩民，崇德諸隊俱在準備中，當可如期加人一一顯身手。又如上海女中，對於體育，素極提倡，徘球隊又見彪炳成績，此番當可整軍。溯在人材有老將張嘉範程洪生祝士芳等經騐甚富，後起有張敏玉翁涵淸等富有遝動天材。如則有此良機，當不輕易坐失。</p>
<h3>籃球學理述要（六）</h3>
<p>— 梁兆安</p>
<p>（丙）投籃</p>
<p>投籃爲一隊比賽中之最終巨標，故每一球負必須熟諳之。設一隊投籃技術低劣，則在比賽中，不能採取攻勢，祗能改用守勢，企求對方獲分較少，而不能希望本隊得勝，其理甚明。反言之，若一隊投籃技術高妙　則全隊信心自堅，精神奮發，聲勢浩蕩，可以急起進攻，可以隨時投籃，取勝機會，自高人一等也。</p>
<p>投籃欲求準確，必須對距離遠近，走動之速度，方向與角度，及投球之高低與判斷力準確，方能成功。遠近與方向，允須審度淸楚，不能有絲毫錯誤。至於投球之高低，則可各有不同，有慣用高拱形投籃，亦有慣用較低之拱形投籃者，但無論如何高低拱形投法，每一投籃，其高度必須比籃圈爲高。如球員已習慣有一定之高度投籃，雖此高度不合於正確之理論，爲指導者，祗須視其此種投法，是吾投中居多，不必强其更改，否則必使其更不準確。若球員常犯投球過遠或過近之弊，顯係判斷力薄弱之故，亟宜糾正之，使其平時鋤加練習，改正其錯誤之處，並檢查其目力。是否有遠視或近視之弊。當投籃時，若遇身體重心未平穩，或所站之地位不良，寗可將球傳與同伴，不可免强投籃，因投籃失落，必易爲對方將球奪去也。</p>
<p>每一球員應熟習各種投籃方法，不應祗熟習一二種，或祗求自己之專長絕技，每投必中，就認爲滿足，不再練習其他方法。須知投籃方法愈完備，獲得投籃之機會則愈多。個人絕技，雖屬艱能可貴，爲人羨慕不已。但祗可偶一爲之，若常用則易爲人看穿，不足爲奇，且易爲對方防守，以致無可再施此技。投籃方法甚多，不能一一叙述於此，現摘其比較通用者，分述如下</p>
<p>（一）胸前推舉投籃法</p>
<p>此種投法，係用兩手手指張開握球兩邊，放在胸前投出。手心不可觸球，球要握得穩，但又不能太緊，緊則不靈活。兩足穩定前後分立，骨較使之自然放鬆；身體重心須保持平均；當投出時，光屈膝下蹲，球移放在腹問，兩肘向下垂，貼近身邊。此時身體隨球往上送出而神起，此種動作須比蹲下時爲迅速，全身手足合作，宜柔順且有節湊。在身體蹲下之時，兩目即注視籃圈或球應擊板之處；及球上升至胸部時，兩手將球送出，投出時兩手背應向己面，手心向籃張開，用手指及手腕力將球推出。球推出後，兩臂仍須隨球之路綫伸直，兩目注視着籃或板，直至球已入籃，或觸板反彈出來爲止。同時身體須準備跟踪上前，以便躍起奪回此球再行投籃，或傳與同伴。</p>
<p>（二）肩上托舉投籃法</p>
<p>通常此種投法，多係在近籃處，被對方嚴密看守時投，故非熟習不爲攻。投進之法，與一般傳球法無異。但多係擊板反彈一入籃，球繫板之處，頗爲重要，宜在高出籃圈半尺一，在籃圈與籃松相成之角上行之。平時練習此種投法，應養成走向籃角，有一規定之路綫，此路綫應與端綫成四十五度角。並須走到離籃六尺之處，即行躍起，身體躍得愈近籃圈，則愈投得準確，身體躍起之後，則以一手或雙手，在肩上將球托舉投入籃內。此抓投法，在籃之前方及左右兩角，三地點均可如法行之。每一球員應在此之地點，熟習至每投十次，必中八次以上，方得認爲合格，其實在此之地點投籃，應視爲萬投不失之區域，如在比賽中，無對方防守，在此區內投不中籃者，實不可以原諒，應受指導嚴格責罰，非再命其用心練習不可。</p>
<p>（三）鈎手投籃法</p>
<p>此種投法，如鈎手傳球法一樣；係用在旋轉之後，及採用阻擋戰略之時，相附而行者爲多。投時先行轉身，避開奮球之人，然後反身躍起，以鈎手傳球法投進；若能在轉身後，假作向左右及前方傳球，或拍球向前衝出一步，然後行之允妙，可使對方莫測高深。但此種投法，不能超出離籃六七尺以外行之，過此限制度，則多不準確，且易爲對方易得觸板反擊出來之球。故平時非熟習，不可爲也。</p>
<h3>體壇拾零</h3>
<p>今日上午逸園之足球賽，聯誼戰僑聯，有關聯甲錦標，預料雙方必有驚人表演。</p>
<p>聯誼本屆集中訓練，有軍事化，一洗去出萎頓之象。</p>
<p>東華籃球隊，據賈幼良云：擬復活加人盃賽</p>

<h3>The Japanese Air Force Continues Fierce Attacks, Sinking Seventeen Ships; Ground Forces Break into the Broon Airfield</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 9th: The Japanese Air Force, attacking enemy ships near Ormoc, Leyte Island, sank one small cruiser and two destroyers in the waters off Bapa on December 7th, and shot down ten enemy aircraft over Ormoc. In this operation, thirteen Japanese aircraft did not return after self-destruction.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 9th: (1) Japanese ground forces in the western Broon area of Leyte Island broke into enemy lines on the morning of the 6th. That night, in coordination with the Kōchi airborne troops, they broke into the northern and southern enemy airfields of Broon, and are engaged in combat with local enemy forces. It seems that the Kōchi airborne troops who broke into other enemy airfields have achieved great results. (2) On the morning of December 7th, an enemy division began landing near Alvera on the west coast of Leyte Island. The Japanese air force immediately dispatched aircraft to attack enemy ships, while ground forces also engaged the enemy in fierce battles. Among the battle results obtained by the air force, the following have been confirmed: the special attack squads "Gokoku" and "Ichiyu" sank one large transport ship, destroyed and set fire to two large transport ships, two ships of unknown type, and other air force units sank one transport ship, destroyed three destroyers, one large transport ship, and numerous landing craft. (3) The Japanese special attack squad "Kinno" attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on December 7th, sinking one battleship and three transport ships.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese "Kamikaze" special attack squadron fiercely attacked the US fleet west of Leyte Island on the 8th. One cruiser and two destroyers were hit and exploded, sinking. Simultaneously, other units of the Kamikaze squadron continued their attacks accordingly, but no reports of results have been received yet.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 9th (Central News Agency) – The US forces in Leyte, with reinforcements, are rapidly advancing from Biankara Bay towards Ormoc, but due to the fierce resistance of the enemy's 32nd and 24th divisions in the Managaran area, their attempts have been thwarted. Furthermore, the enemy's 7th, 96th, and 1st Mechanized Divisions, who were planning to advance from the east coast of Leyte towards the western highlands of Haro and Tagami, were completely stopped on the night of the 6th by the courageous surprise attacks of the Japanese ground forces in coordination with airborne troops. Due to the weakening of combat power, the enemy forces in Leyte as a whole are increasingly anxious. As a result, the enemy forces have dispatched a part of the 7th Division from Bapa to Damraan, using every means to try to establish an advantage in Ormoc Bay, but the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on this northward-moving enemy force at Damraan on the 7th. The enemy vanguard has been blocked in that area, but in order to gain an advantageous battle line, the enemy is currently landing amphibious tanks and other equipment in that area, desperately trying to reverse the decline.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Commander MacWhorter announced on the 8th: (1) In the naval and air battle fought in Ormoc Bay on the 7th, one US destroyer and one small transport ship were sunk by Japanese air force torpedoes.

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese Kōchi parachute troops infiltrated the enemy airfield on Leyte, the battle on Leyte Island became even more intense. Before this heroic feat, Japanese special attack squads launched a large-scale operation on the 5th, fiercely attacking enemy ship groups patrolling around Leyte. In addition to the results of the "Ishiwatari" squad announced on the 7th, which sank one ship, it has now been confirmed that one aircraft from the "Manto" squadron sank an enemy cruiser, and three aircraft from the "Ichiyu" squadron sank three transport ships. On this day alone, the Japanese air force sank or destroyed eleven enemy ships. The course of their struggle is generally as follows: One aircraft from the "Manto" squadron bravely plunged into the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf, and made a courageous direct impact on the heart of a large enemy warship or cruiser. The enemy ship immediately reverberated with a loud bang and began to catch fire and list, it is presumed that it soon sank. Three aircraft from the "Tesshin" squadron were searching for enemy ships east of Leyte Gulf when they suddenly discovered a transport convoy west of Saar Island protected by escort ships. The three aircraft used floating clouds, braved intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, and rushed into the enemy airspace, forming a single-file formation and simultaneously breaking into the convoy. At this time, the Japanese escort aircraft gradually engaged the enemy interceptors in fierce battles, so they were unable to confirm the battle results, only imprinting the moment of the Japanese aircraft's charge into their eyes. Also, in this operation, one Japanese escort fighter was lost and never returned. On the 7th, they attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf for about an hour, although the battle results were not confirmed. Later, according to reports from naval units, three aircraft from the "Ichiyu" squadron each made a dive-bombing attack on an enemy transport convoy, certainly sinking three enemy ships.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Burma with Strict Defenses - Commander Kimura Speaks</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kimura, the supreme commander of the Japanese army in Burma, made the following statement on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Since last year, the enemy has been trying to open the land transportation route between China and India with the Allied forces of Britain, America, and Chiang Kai-shek, while also attempting to sacrifice the Indian people and recapture Burma. In addition, they have strengthened the Indian Ocean Fleet and want to invade from the sea, but because the Japanese army in Burma has strict defenses, the enemy's attempts have failed. The domestic strength of Burma has recently become increasingly solid, the Provisional Government of Free India is also actively replenishing its combat power, and the morale of the Japanese Expeditionary Force is becoming more and more high. The unwavering belief in victory is becoming more and more firm. With this strong spirit, we will surely make Burma as solid as a rock. At the same time, we will also do our best to assist the Provisional Government of Free India in achieving its long-cherished wish. Now, before the enemy implements a general counterattack, we will boldly adopt an offensive posture, in order to permanently remove the presence of Britain and America from East Asia. To achieve this goal, the three countries of Japan, Burma, and India must work together with one heart and mind, believing in and supporting each other, and fighting forward together with the spirit of daring to die.</p>
<h3>Inheriting the Fighting Spirit of Our Predecessors to Defend the Philippines - General Yamashita Broadcasts to the Nation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the front lines of Leyte, who commands the three armed forces with both loyalty and bravery, gave a special broadcast to the country from the front lines of smoke and gunfire on the evening of the 8th. The main content is as follows: Recently, in the decisive battles off the coast of Taiwan, the eastern sea of the Philippines, and Leyte Island, as well as the attacks on Morotai and Saipan, our army, navy, and air force have achieved great results, which is extremely gratifying. Our army was able to achieve such results with a small number of troops against an enemy that relies on material resources and superior mobility. The reason is that we have inherited our traditional spirit of fighting to the death. The Japanese people must continue to uphold this spirit in the future. At the same time, I will also uphold this spirit and move forward to accomplish the task of annihilating the enemy. For example, when our side collides a fighter piloted by one person with a B-29, which is known as an aerial fortress, it is one against ten; when one aircraft collides with an enemy aircraft carrier or battleship, it is one against a thousand or ten thousand. The magnitude of its effect is unparalleled. If we can move forward with this spirit and defeat the enemy who relies on material resources, it is not difficult. For example, in the fierce battle of Peleliu Island, it has been two months since the enemy has been continuously attacking with several divisions, but they have suffered heavy losses, which is really due to the spirit of collision of our army. My task is to defend the Philippines. In the future, we will certainly achieve great victories, and we will constantly cultivate this spirit to make it even better. Although the Philippines was only a limited island country in the Pacific in the past, it is a large island comparatively speaking, and it has the freedom to turn left and right. I will absolutely inherit the fighting spirit left by my predecessors and use all my strength to defeat the enemy.</p>

<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Fourth Year of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>The third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War has passed, and we are now entering the fourth year of the war. As we reflect on the third anniversary and begin the fourth year, it seems that we must raise several feelings and experiences as indicators for our efforts in the fourth year.</p>
<p>The first is the feeling and experience of the importance of production warfare outside of the operations on the battlefield. The enemy America intends to overwhelm others with its huge productivity, but our ally Japan, not willing to fall behind, has been catching up rapidly in recent years, striving to increase production with aircraft as the center, and has achieved great results, thereby being able to meet the needs of front-line operations and destroy the stubborn enemy. In order to thoroughly destroy the ambitions of the enemy America, we must make even more special efforts in this regard in the future.</p>
<p>The second is the feeling of the greatness of popular strength, both on the battlefield and in production. The heroic feats and spirit of sacrifice of the Allied soldiers fighting on the front lines and the Japanese expatriates in the Allied war zones are all due to the great display of popular strength. And the rapid surge in military production in Allied Japan is also based on the great popular strength. China should also emulate the Allies in leveraging huge popular strength.</p>
<p>The third is the feeling of the great decisiveness of political operations. The ability of Allied Japan to leverage such popular and material strength is largely due to sound political guidance. Conversely, the reason why many things in China still cannot be perfected and the people's livelihood is difficult is very related to unsound politics. Therefore, improving politics is the key to unleashing China's power.</p>
<p>However, among the above three points, the most basic object we should strive for seems to be still the first point, the enhancement of production. The most important goals of leveraging popular strength and politics are to promote production development, so as to help the Allies contribute to the Greater East Asia War with more economic power. And in reality, the important responsibility that China should and can bear in the Great East Asia War is to provide material resources.</p>
<p>China is rich in resources and abundant in material resources. If we can further develop them and mobilize them more rationally, we believe that it will be of great assistance to the production war in the Greater East Asia War. However, regrettably, we feel that our past efforts have not been enough. Chairman Wang once instructed that this year is the year of production, calling on us to engage in increasing production. In fact, have we completely done it? Looking at recent production, some have not only not increased, but have also shown a trend of decline. We are really too ashamed. Now that the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War has begun, how should we redouble our efforts to make up for the shortcomings of the past few years and fully enhance the production war assistance in the Greater East Asia War?</p>
<p>In the past, we seemed to focus too much on the surface and neglected practice. There were only empty production committees, research meetings, discussion meetings, and representative conferences, etc. Although there were many motions and large plans, most of them were empty and unrealistic, said but not acted, and ultimately ended up on paper. What was really done was too little. In the future, we must be realistic and seek truth from facts, emphasizing practice rather than simply perfunctory on the surface. When formulating plans, we must consider what can be done, and the plans that can be done must be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<p>We had better define the fourth year of the Greater East Asia War as the year of increasing production practice. We should seek a real increase in production. The object of increasing production should naturally be military needs first, but with such poor civil needs now, increasing civil needs production is also an urgent matter. May the Chinese and Japanese authorities pay attention to this together.</p>
<h3>Grand Commemorations Held Across the Country on the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Arousing Public Sentiment to the Utmost</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Yesterday (the 8th) was the day of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. At this time when the war situation has entered the decisive stage, the arrival of this anniversary is of great and profound significance. In addition to the grand commemoration events held by all sectors of the capital's government, military, police, people, and youth, all provinces, cities, counties, military and political institutions, people's organizations, etc. across the country have also launched great and enthusiastic commemorative programs. Under the auspices of the provincial government, in the three towns of Wuhan, in addition to the expanded commemorative ceremony held by the various departments and bureaus of the provincial government, the Provincial Security Command, and the Provincial Party Department, the Wuchang and Hankou also held mass rallies to destroy the British and American people. Amidst the indiscriminate bombing by enemy aircraft in Wuhan, the public's emotions were even more excited, and the determination to destroy the British and American enemy was even stronger. In the afternoon, a mass rally was held, and all the propaganda personnel were dispatched to give street speeches. In Beiping, the various agencies under the Political Affairs Committee held a grand ceremony in the morning and a mass rally in the afternoon. The atmosphere of hating the British and American enemy was extremely strong. Tianjin, Xuzhou, Kaifeng, Bengbu, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Anqing, and other places also held commemorative ceremonies.</p>
<h3>Commemoration Ceremony for Participation in the War Held in the Capital Yesterday Morning</h3>

All working comrades from the various ministries and commissions of the Central Government participated. It was presided over by Deputy Secretary-General Dai Ce, who read the declaration of participation in the war, stood in solemn respect for the soldiers at the front lines to strive for victory, prayed silently for the recovery of the wounded and sick soldiers, and observed silence to mourn the fallen soldiers.

<h3>Minister of Intelligence Kishi Delivers Speech: The Essence of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>At the Mass Rally in the Capital</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Kishi, Minister of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy in China, delivered a speech entitled "The Essence of the Greater East Asia War" at the "Sino-Japanese People's Joint Decisive Battle Rally" on the 9th. The main points are as follows: Japan's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War has been stated in the declaration of war, and the goals that the Greater East Asia War must achieve have also been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. I need not elaborate further. Japan is repelling the ambitions of Britain and America to dominate East Asia and restoring its original appearance, so it resolutely carried out the Meiji Restoration.</p>
<p>The Japanese nation's determination to create the driving force for this Meiji Restoration 80 years ago has been constantly expanding its scale until the Greater East Asia War. The historical and moral forces that the material concepts of Britain and America cannot calculate have repeatedly been in this kind of power, which has formed the main body of Japan's war effort. Among them are the spirit of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the spirit of all the soldiers dying on Az Island and Saipan. This spirit is regarded as extremely ordinary by the Japanese, but it is an incomprehensible mystery in the eyes of Britain and America.</p>
<p>What exactly is America's war goal? America's material prosperity is all derived from the exploitation of the East Asian nations. Therefore, once the East Asian nations, with Japan as the forerunner, gain liberation, America's willful enjoyment of material life will be denied. Therefore, no matter what, they want to sacrifice other nations to maintain it. This</p>
<p>American war goal</p>
<p>is also America's war intention. The current war situation in the Leyte Island area is extremely important, but now the Japanese army's encirclement has gradually been completed on that island, and the American army's supply line will be cut off. Furthermore, because Japanese paratroopers forcibly landed and attacked the enemy camp, the enemy army is in a state of isolation and helplessness, and can only surrender or be annihilated. Therefore, today is a great opportunity to destroy the arrogant enemy. We, the Greater East Asian nations, are determined to gather all our strength to complete the war to defend East Asia and liberate East Asia, which is also today. As for Britain, it is almost</p>
<p>Becoming an American vassal</p>
<p>Britain itself knows that its war goal of maintaining its own hegemony cannot be achieved by jointly waging war with the United States. Britain's worries and distress are also here. For example, the Indian issue is the center of its worries. As for the Chongqing side's cry for resistance, what can be expected of it? Assuming that the so-called final victory of the Chongqing side can be obtained, what benefit will the Chinese nation have? The national destinies of China, India, and Japan are fundamentally inseparable. The revival of China can not only arouse India's awareness, but also ensure Japan's development, that is, the defense force of Greater East Asia, is absolutely necessary in the premise and in the conclusion. This is the historical inevitability of Asian nations. Although the Chongqing and Communist parties continue to chant the anti-Japanese national united front, their cooperation and conflict continue to arise, so it is not surprising that their state of confusion as to whether they are cooperating or conflicting is confusing. If we want to say the essence of the Greater East Asia War, it is to</p>
<p>Ask the tiger to give up its teeth</p>
<p>Because thinking that the tiger has teeth is equal to denying the existence of the tiger, it is equal to asking the tiger to give up its teeth. It goes without saying that this matter cannot be successfully achieved merely by compromise or negotiation. Looking at the former, Britain and America have not only exploited India and Malaya, but also want to place China under their control. The latter advocates the Monroe Doctrine to reject other countries' right to speak on the American continent, and on the one hand, it seized the Philippines from Spain, annexed it regardless of the Filipinos' will, and under the name of open door and equal opportunity, it wants to fulfill its ambitions towards China. Therefore, for the dignity and progress of mankind, it is determined to break this irrationality. That is why Japan declared war on Britain and America. It is impossible to say to the tiger with reason or to pour out sincerity, to regard the carnivorous tiger as a herbivore. Therefore, this Greater East Asia War cannot be compromised. Therefore, it is a fundamental way to persevere in the war until the tiger's teeth are cut off, and only in this way can we expect true peace and progress in the world.</p>
<h3>General Mobilization to Defend East Asia - Propaganda Minister Lin Gave Broadcast Speech the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>For the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Propaganda Minister Lin gave a broadcast speech entitled "General Mobilization to Defend East Asia" at 10:10 PM on the 8th at the Central Radio Station. The main points are as follows: In the three years of the Greater East Asia War, Allied Japan has been at the front, holding on firmly as the vanguard, wiping out the British and American forces that have occupied Asia for more than a hundred years with a quick knife, and achieving glorious war results. China, Manchuria, Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, India, and other countries in the rear have risen one after another under the banner of striving for the liberation of the East Asian nations, with the determination to cooperate and the belief in victory, mobilizing full-scale manpower and material resources to jointly shoulder the responsibility of completing the war, and have also achieved considerable success. For more than a hundred years, the ambitions of British and American imperialism to dominate the world have been endless. They have actively expanded from East Asia with their military and economic violence. Except for the rejuvenated and self-strengthening Meiji Japan, which has not been poisoned, it can be said that no other weak national country in Asia has been able to avoid it. Especially in China, which has frequent troubles, the claws of aggression have taken advantage of the situation and directly entered.</p>
<p>Opening Up a Road to Strive for Freedom, Chairman Wang had long seen this great crisis, so he tried his best to prevent it before the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. After the incident occurred, he tried his best to remedy it. Finally, he resolutely opened up a road to Sino-Japanese peace for the country and for East Asia. At the beginning of the peace movement, he clearly said that the peace movement is a process to complete China's independence and autonomy, and it is a political action that does not label itself with any other doctrine. The greatest goal of the peace movement is obviously still to overthrow British and American aggression and seek China's freedom and independence by liberating East Asia. Therefore, the peace movement itself is a re-departure of the national revolution, that is, inheriting the teachings of the national father and putting the route of the national revolution back on the right track, so that it can develop towards a more advanced path.</p>
<p>Inheriting the Legacy and Moving Forward Courageously, now that it has been less than a month since Chairman Wang passed away, it is the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Today, although we, the people of the whole country, cannot hear Chairman Wang's solemn and sincere instructions, Chairman Wang's constant encouragements to us over the years still remain in our memories. Striving for peace to save China is Chairman Wang's lifelong aspiration, and we must make it a reality. Unification is a prerequisite for peace and national construction, and we must make it complete. The Greater East Asia War is the first step in saving China and protecting East Asia, and we must do our best to strive for victory. It must be known that the Greater East Asia War is a war for all East Asian nations to strive for freedom and liberation, that is, the beginning of the joint construction of a new world in East Asia by East Asians. All of us 100 million nationals in East Asia must make the final and desperate battle against the British and American aggressors with the great determination to share the same joys and sorrows and to live and die together. As long as the British and American forces do not withdraw from our East Asia, we will swear to fight them to the end. Although Chairman Wang has passed away, the lamp of justice has shone with thousands of rays of light among the Asian nations, illuminating a great road for 100 million nations to struggle for survival. Chinese compatriots, comrades in all of Asia, now is the time for the general mobilization of our fighting ranks. Let us join hands and welcome the arrival of great victory.</p>
<h3>Joint Talk of the Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen the decisive battle system and increase administrative efficiency, the Central Government held a joint talk of the Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 9th to discuss (1) the presentation and deliberation of legal bills, the adjudication of principles, and the verification of provisions; (2) the decision on orders of great importance that require emergency measures; (3) matters that should be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting according to the powers of the departments; (4) departmental orders issued by the departments themselves according to law; (5) which of the various administrative measures should be carried out by departmental orders, which should be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval, and which should be presented to the Central Political Committee or the Supreme National Defense Conference for resolution; and (6) the determination of policies, the formulation of technical plans, and the review of expenses. After two hours of detailed discussion, the results of the talk will be reported separately to the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Executive Yuan meeting for implementation.</p>
<h3>Su Kunyu's Inspection Record of Rice Producing Areas (4)</h3>
<p>Five, Rationing Issues</p>
<p>The National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for the Transportation and Sales Management of Rice in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui" on September 27th. After the administrative authorities implemented it, the impact on Shanghai is beyond the scope of this article. As for the impact on cities and villages in Jiangsu Province, what was the result after the inspection? The results are as follows:</p>
<p>In cities, there are two types of rice and grain transportation: restricted and unrestricted. For restricted areas, such as Suzhou and Kunshan, only a small amount of rice is allowed to be carried into the city from the suburbs of Suzhou, causing the rice price in the city to rise to 18,000 yuan per stone.</p>
<p>Kunshan is a major gateway for smuggling in the Suzhou area. Along the mountains near Kunshan County, as far as Qingpu, despite this year's bumper harvest, due to transshipment to Shanghai, Kunshan rice is secretly transported from Qingpu to Shanghai. The smuggling method involves using civilian boats, with rice bags at the bottom, oil paper in the middle, and straw piled on top. As of now, the military has discovered and confiscated a total of 355,470 stones of rice and 17,500 stones of grain. The Kunshan County government has already dispatched security teams and police to form a blockade line near Pengwen Town. At the same time, there are strict restrictions on transporting rice from the countryside to the city. The wealthy in the city have accumulated rice and grain, causing problems. Most of the sufferers are salaried workers and coolies. The black market rice price is soaring, and there is no household rice rationing, making their situation truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Unrestricted areas include Changshu City. The transportation of rice from rural areas to the city is unrestricted and unimpeded. Previously, the rice price in the city once rose to 13,000 yuan per stone. The Rice and Grain Association decided to announce the suspension of trading among members, and the price immediately dropped to about 9,000 yuan per stone. The public was delighted and agreed with this measure. Regarding this point, the reporter group inquired with the relevant authorities, who said: "The situation in the Changshu area is relatively special. Rather than allowing rice to be smuggled and transported north across the Yangtze River, it is better to allow it to be transported into the city. Moreover, the rice stored in the city is still consumed by the people of Changshu."</p>
<p>The restrictions on rice and grain transportation between cities and villages may be necessary measures, and we cannot criticize them. However, during the period of restricting rice and grain transportation, there is no household rice rationing in the city, so what do the city residents eat and how do they survive?</p>
<p>"When will the rationing system be established in cities in Jiangsu Province?" The reporter group asked the provincial government representative this question, and he replied: "Regarding the rationing of rice in the four major cities in the province (Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang), the provincial government is planning it and hopes to realize it in the short term. The rationing agency will contact the Rice Control Association and then order each county to designate rice merchants to handle it."</p>
<p>The reporter group also asked Kunshan County Chief Yang, "Rice and grain transportation has already been restricted. How will the food of the city residents be handled?" County Chief Yang said: "This county is planning to hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss and plan the rice rationing issue."</p>
<p>Regarding rice rationing in cities in Jiangsu Province, the authorities did not seem to have implemented it during the peak of rice procurement, only using "planning" as an answer. In reality, if household rice rationing in the city is not implemented immediately, it will also affect the work of purchasing food rice, as people store food rice, making the procurement work difficult to proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Regarding rice and grain transportation in rural areas, in some areas, free transportation within the same area is allowed, while in others, strict and complete transportation restrictions are implemented. For example, Changshu's second district implements the latter method. However, there are non-rice producing areas nearby. Farmers in cotton growing areas produce very little rice, which is insufficient for consumption. The cotton produced is handed over at a fixed price, and the rice consumed needs to be purchased at black market prices, making the farmers' lives problematic.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of rice for farmers in cotton growing areas, the Cotton Control Association, Flour Control Association, Oil and Grain Control Association, and Rice Control Association should jointly be responsible for solving it. Among them, the Cotton Control Association, when purchasing cotton, relies on the farmers in the cotton growing areas. After the purchase is completed, the farmers are abandoned and no longer cared for. This attitude needs to be corrected. In reality, the above four control associations for cotton, flour, oil, and rice each operate administratively and do not establish connections. It is hoped that a unified institution can be established between the work of the four control associations to jointly be responsible for protecting farmers and implementing a policy of valuing agriculture.</p>
<p>Regarding the rationing of materials, in Jiangsu Province, only cooperatives slightly engage in rationing. Other institutions do not make efforts to implement it. It is hoped that the authorities can pay close attention to this issue, as it is related to people's livelihood and is extremely important.</p>
<p>Six, Cooperative Issues</p>
<p>The cooperative has achieved the most remarkable results in the work of procuring rice and grain because it regularly rations materials in rural areas, and farmers have confidence in it. Regarding the situation of cooperatives assisting the Rice Control Association in procuring rice and grain, a general idea can be gleaned from Suzhou and Kunshan:</p>
<p>Cooperatives in the Suzhou area directly interact with farmers. From the head office to the county branches to the district sub-branches, passing through the stages of the Bao, they are combined into mutual aid societies. The mutual aid societies serve as units to enable farmers to understand the true meaning of cooperation and simultaneously carry out procurement and production increase work.</p>
<p>The area in which the cooperative is responsible for procuring rice and grain is the area in which the cooperative handles rural loans, fertilizers, and other rations. As a result, farmers enthusiastically take out rice and grain. For example, the Wujiang District Cooperative handles the procurement of rice and grain in four designated villages. Three other nearby villages also requested to be procurement areas for the cooperative because the cooperative offers fair prices and never profits from it. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Capital of Hungary Clearly Hears the Sound of Cannons. The War Will Soon Reach its Peak</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Budapest, 9th - Huitong News: The sound of cannons can be heard very clearly in Budapest. Traffic in the city is frequent, and troops and Arrow Cross gangs often pass through the streets.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 9th - Huitong News: The major reason for the Soviet army's major offensive on Budapest on the west bank of the Danube is the northward advance of the German army in the Balkans. The German army in western Serbia is also advancing north at the same time, so the Soviet army's flanks are under considerable threat. The Soviet army between Lake Platten and the Danube has suffered heavy losses but has made no progress. The Soviet army attacking south from Seiler Island has also failed to break through. The situation near Hartwen remains unchanged. The Soviet tank convoy that advanced to the Danube via Qilak suddenly attacked Budapest to the south but has been blocked, and its rear transportation has also been cut off. Judging from various phenomena, the battle of Budapest may soon reach its peak.</p>

<h3>Order from the Economic Security Office: All Industries Must Strictly Abide by Price Limits. Director Goto's Speech Hopes for Cooperation from All Industries</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office of the Municipal Police Department held a symposium at the Police Club of the bureau at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, convening more than 50 chairmen of trade associations from various industries. It was presided over by Director Shigeru Goto, with Deputy Director Heiji Nomura, Head of the First Section Zhihai Dou, Fear of the Second Section Futian, Deputy Section Chief Guangchen Yang, and Commander of the Economic Police Corps Yamamoto all in attendance.</p>
<p>Illegal Operations Will Be Cracked Down On</p>
<p>First, Director Goto gave a report, stating: "This office is responsible for implementing and cracking down on the economic policies of the municipal government, the Economic Bureau, and the economic policies of the Japanese Embassy. The current economic problems in Shanghai are quite serious and concern the entire livelihood of the people, so the authorities and all sectors are very concerned. There are many reasons for the current economic situation, but some people who have authority over wartime economic policies have not yet recognized it clearly. Originally, the Shanghai market in the past was free and not subject to any restrictions. Merchants hope that prices will rise because the more they rise, the more profitable they are. However, in wartime economic policies, the overall livelihood of the people must be taken into account, and no excessive profits should be sought, and actions that violate economic policies should not be taken. I believe that none of you here have a profit-seeking concept, and if there are any, I hope they will be thoroughly corrected. In order to thoroughly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the police authorities will severely crack down on irregular and profit-seeking illegal operations. I also hope that you will assist the authorities under the same goal, supervise the employees, factories, companies, and firms of each association, abide by economic policies, and do everything possible to suppress prices. Since the establishment of this office, in a few months, many factories, shops, and firms have been cracked down on and severely punished. This is because the industry associations have not had sufficient communication and cooperation with this office. However, I do not want to have this measure. When it is unavoidable, only police force will be used to punish illegal merchants. The power of this office is limited, and it is very difficult to handle various economic policies. Therefore, I hope that you will report and crack down on the improper behavior and irregular operations of members, so that the task of this office can also be completed."</p>
<p>Severe Legal Action Will Be Taken for Exceeding Price Limits</p>
<p>Then, Deputy Director Heiji Yamaguchi gave a speech, stating: "In the past, communication between this office and the industry associations was not close, and we could not fully understand each other. Under the current economic situation, we hope that you will cooperate in areas where this office cannot handle. Recently, it has been found that member stores and firms of various associations have applied to the authorities to increase price limits without approval, and the association authorities have tacitly approved members to increase prices without authorization, which is illegal. If the original price limit is already unreasonable, the members cannot be allowed to raise prices without authorization. They must apply to the authorities for approval before they can increase the selling price, otherwise they will be punished according to law. The association authorities should supervise the members to strictly abide by the price limits and abide by the political policies of the authorities. This office will strictly investigate and crack down on daily necessities, miscellaneous grains, and other items that seek excessive profits and are harmful to people's livelihood. At the same time, this office is actively investigating warehouses to look for illegal merchants or non-industry people who are hoarding. We hope that you will cooperate in reporting them. Regarding improper behavior of the staff of this office, please report it without hesitation, and we will investigate it with appropriate methods." Then, Team Leader Yamamoto gave a speech, elaborating on the tasks of the economic police in detail, and in order to thoroughly crack down on bad elements who falsely impersonate merchants and deceive them, he hoped that people would report them. Furthermore, Section Chief Futian stated that in the past, the punishment for illegal merchants was only fines and confiscation of items, which did not seem to be a concern for the general merchants. Therefore, in the future, illegal merchants must be sent to the prosecutor's office to be severely punished by judicial measures.

<h3>Broadcast Speech by Chairman Bose of India in China: Building a New Asia Requires Sino-Japanese Cooperation. The US Uses the Chongqing Side as a Tool Against Japan</h3>
<p>Some time ago, I was in Tokyo and broadcasted to you at the request of Tokyo Radio. Today, I am again addressing you in China, and I will briefly repeat the main points of the previous broadcast. My first impression after arriving in the accountable country was the death of Chairman Wang of your country.</p>
<p>Deeply Mournful. I am well aware of how our enemies and some Chinese people judge the late Chairman, but no one can deny three important facts about Mr. Wang. First, Mr. Wang was a loyal follower and comrade of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. Second, Mr. Wang dedicated his life to the Chinese nation and people. Third, when Mr. Wang was driven by his conscience and separated from his colleagues, he had a very firm will and self-sacrifice. Our enemies often apply the terms traitor and puppet to their enemies, Mr. Wang, President Lerolle, Bamo, and myself. All of them are given this title, but if the above-mentioned people are selfish and self-interested, they can only withdraw from the world and not ask about world affairs, or follow the trend in order to seek their comfort and security. The reason why they have risen up and disregarded difficulties is nothing more than being driven by the spirit of the highest responsibility and lofty ideals. Based on their experience, they no longer believe in Western European imperialism, especially the United States and Britain, and only Japan can help others. As for the Soviet Union, it cannot provide any assistance to the weak Asian nations, so these leaders have to accept Japan's friendship and cooperation. Some Chinese people may say that this policy of cooperation with Japan may be suitable for countries such as India, Myanmar, and the Philippines, but China should still take resistance against Japan as a</p>
<p>Appropriate Policy. Therefore, I would like to point out the following points: (1) The establishment of a new Asia cannot be without China. Without China's cooperation, any policy that is beneficial to Asia cannot be realized. China must not regard the needs of Asia as nothing. (2) Asia cannot be without Japan's cooperation. If there is no Japan, are there any other countries in Asia that can resist Western imperialist countries? Although China's potential is great, it cannot bear the heavy responsibility of liberating Asia before it is unified, industrialized, and recognized. As it stands, Asia cannot be reborn without Japan's assistance. The strength of Western imperialists lies in their navy, and only Japan in Asia possesses a first-class navy. If we want to resist the aggression of Britain and the United States, we must have the assistance of a first-class navy. (3) Even if Britain and the United States express friendship to the Chongqing side today, it is not out of deep love for the Chongqing side or China, but because they hate Japan. The United States' toleration of the Communist Party is also out of the same motivation. General Chiang Kai-shek should understand this point. The United States, from the standpoint of its own interests, originally opposed communism, but in order to try to destroy Japan, it is prepared to tolerate communism and encourage the Chinese Communist Party. (4) Since Britain and the United States sympathize with the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party for their own interests, they will naturally demand the full price of the sympathy and assistance they give. If General Chiang Kai-shek is a politician, he should eliminate hatred and prejudice and</p>
<p>Face the Facts. We all know China's old grievances against Japan, so before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, India also sympathized with the Chongqing side, because at that time, it recognized the Chongqing side as the representative and spokesperson of China. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the entire situation has undergone drastic changes, and the attitude and policies of the Japanese government, army, and people have also changed greatly. If I were not convinced of this point, I would not dare to talk about the China problem. Asia cannot be without China, nor can it be without Japan, so all Asian countries want to see China and Japan conclude a glorious treaty.</p>
<h3>News from the News Aid Society: Special Solicitation of Aid Funds. Deeply Hoping That All Sectors Will Promote It Quickly</h3>
<p>This newspaper has been raising funds for the 8th Aid Fund since the 1st of this month, launching a "Special Solicitation Team" with a target of 1,000 teams, each with at least 20,000 yuan, limited to one month. We have been making urgent appeals to people from all walks of life for days. As of today, it has been the 10th day, but the response has not been enthusiastic, and the number of people recognizing teams and donating funds is far from our expected goal. We believe that influential people in the community will not stand by and watch, allowing more than 4,000 outstanding and poor students to lose their education, and causing the country and society to suffer great losses. Judging from the current trend of donations, it has already made us extremely anxious and worried. What is anxious is that the solicitation period is urgent, and we are deeply afraid that the donations will not easily reach the target. What is worrying is that the funds raised do not match the budget, and we are deeply afraid that more than 4,000 poor students will have no tuition fees for the next semester, which will lead to the interruption of their studies. In summary, we are purely considering the interests of the country and society, and we believe that wise and influential readers will definitely sympathize and support us. However, sympathy and support are not just words, but actions.</p>
<p>This newspaper has already printed various printed materials. One is the "Team Recognition and Payment Notice." Those who recognize teams only need to fill it out and submit it, and someone will be sent to the designated location to collect the funds with a formal receipt. The other is the "Collective Donation Signing Form," which can be initiated by one person and gather several people to raise enough for a team, which is a method of turning small amounts into large amounts. People from all walks of life who are interested in helping students can collect them from the business department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Lang Jingshan's Photography Exhibition Opens Today: Photographer Lang Jingshan and his wife, Ms. Lei Peizhi, will exhibit their photography and Chinese painting works at the Dazhong Art Gallery. It will open at 9:00 AM this morning for a period of ten days. All proceeds from the charity sale of the works will be donated to the News and this Newspaper's Aid Fund. The Lang couple's works have a long-standing reputation in the art world, and they are also charity sales to help students, which should be praised by people in the community. Its grand occasion can be predicted.</p>
<p>The Literary Exhibition Achieves Excellent Results: The Shanghai Industrial Bank and Xinghua Industrial Company held a literary exhibition by colleagues in response to this newspaper's "Special Solicitation" for the Aid Fund. The venue is the China Bookstore. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been enthusiastically visiting and ordering works. The exhibition displays calligraphy, paintings, and photography by ten famous artists, all of which are wonderful. Today and tomorrow are the last two days. We hope that people who are enthusiastic about helping students will give their support, so that they can enjoy the name of helping students and obtain valuable works, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Birthday of Mr. Xue Zhulin Kanghou: Exhibition of Oracle Bone Script to Be Held at the China Art Museum Starting Today</p>
<p>In the past forty years, oracle bone script has been transformed from antiques in the hands of antique dealers into international academic reference materials. However, due to the frequent wars, the discovery and collection of oracle bones have become increasingly rare, and it is not easy to preserve and store them. In addition, this object is a precious product of our country's civilization. Today, we are pleased to celebrate Mr. Lin Kanghou's 69th birthday, which allows us to publicly display them so that we can quickly see the handwriting of our ancient ancestors. This is a rhyme and a grand event, and also a thousand-year-old story. The oracle bones exhibited this time are the last batch of unearthed objects before the war, and they are also one of the most refined parts of the unearthed objects in the past, and have not yet been recorded. The characters in this article are all related to the system of the Shang Dynasty, which is very interesting for research. The exhibition will be held from today to the 15th at the China Art Museum, 996 Jing'an Temple Road, Majestic Building.</p>

<h3>Memoirs of the Kamikaze Attack Corps</h3>
<p>The Allied powers’ Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, with their spirit of human bullets and courageous devotion to duty, have created unprecedented and great war results, causing the enemy to lose their nerve. Salt Field Captain of the Allied powers’ stationed-in-China Sports Team, in order to make the general public understand the words and deeds of the "Kamikaze" corps, has made the following introduction with detailed explanations.</p>
<p>The "Kamikaze Special Attack Corps," initiated by Captain Seki and four other warriors, also known as the "Sure Death Squad," is a human bullet attack corps from which there is no return. Today, the "Kamikaze" has become a whirlwind covering the South Sea, with the determination to not stop until the enemy is destroyed. Generous devotion to duty is rare both in ancient and modern times. To be able to calmly deal with matters and die peacefully is not something ordinary people can easily do. However, in the minds of the young warriors of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, aged twenty-odd, there is no such thing as glory or wealth, and they even forget themselves, only knowing to sacrifice themselves for the sovereign and the country, and die with a smile. The mental state of these warriors is often indifferent, so once they are launched, they are like thunder. This kind of sure-death attack is indeed a manifestation of the glorious tradition of the Japanese Navy, and it proclaims its military prowess at home and abroad without regret.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps includes the following teams (limited to those whose names have appeared on the battlefield):</p>
<p>Shikishima, Yamato, Asahi, Yamazakura, Kikusui (First Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>Chuyu, Giretsu, Junchu, Shisei, Seichu (Second Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>Tenpei, Meika, Sakon (Those after the Second Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>The following are excerpts from the instructions of the Commander-in-Chief and Commanders, as well as the words and deeds of the warriors, to give a glimpse of the spirit of the Kamikaze.</p>
<p>Commander's Instructions: "The rise and fall of the nation depends on this moment. The victory of this decisive battle in the Pacific depends on your shoulders. May you, with your human bullets, stir up the Kamikaze! For the sake of His Majesty the Emperor and our motherland, this Commander-in-Chief is willing to receive your lives. Your only regret, I think, is not being able to know the results of the battle. However, the escort aircraft of the direct cover team will carefully observe your battles and report to the Chief. The Chief will also report to His Majesty the Emperor and inform your spirits of the results of the battle. Therefore, you do not need to have any regrets. Please strive for it!" (Instructions from Commander-in-Chief So-and-so Lieutenant General to the First Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>"...The manifestation of the supreme sacrificial spirit is the true essence of the divine country's divine soldiers. You will be its incarnation and become the most divine of the divine soldiers. Go forth, my comrades! Be sure to achieve your goals! Your loyalty and bravery for the country, your righteousness, pure loyalty, and sincerity are unparalleled. The great achievements you establish will surely move His Majesty the Emperor. Your parents, whether they are still in this world or not, will surely be sincerely gratified. One hundred million people will also be excited and grateful. This is what this officer deeply expects of you." (Instructions from Commander So-and-so to the Second Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>"Divine spirits are to be respected but not to be sought. Stirring up the Kamikaze depends on your own struggles!" (Instructions from Commander So-and-so)</p>
<p>"Come on, everyone, let's shake hands!"..."Although great battle results have been established one after another, the enemy is still coming! I rely on you a lot! That's what I want to say." (Words of Commander So-and-so when shaking hands with members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps to say goodbye)</p>
<p>"Now, the young members are all divine spirits! I've thought so for a long time." (Words of Commander So-and-so when receiving the first report)</p>
<p>"The target of attack is the enemy's aircraft carrier. When ramming, you must choose the weak point of the aircraft carrier." (Instructions from a Deputy Commander before departure)</p>
<p>Brave Warriors' Statements: "We are not the field team, we are bombs! Okay, follow me!" (Slogan of Captain Seki)</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the Empire depends on this battle. From this moment on, I will set out to carry out the honorable mission of sacrificing myself to attack the enemy's aircraft carrier." (Middle report of So-and-so Captain of the Second Special Attack Corps)</p>
<p>"If everyone thinks they are going to die and doesn't pay attention to enemy fighters, that's not right. We must preserve our lives before entering the enemy's mobile force. Dying without reaching the enemy ship is a futile death. Watch out for enemy fighters! Maintain strict vigilance!" (Words of So-and-so Captain warning his subordinates)</p>
<p>"It is very difficult to achieve the greatest effect and be able to survive. It is especially difficult for us ordinary people. However, our mission is simply to accompany the bomb, which has no living eyes, until it correctly hits the enemy ship. Therefore, as long as you are a pilot, anyone can do it." (Remarks made by So-and-so Captain just before the attack)</p>
<p>"It would be terrible if I went in dirty clothes and was hated by King Yama in hell and driven back..." (Remarks made by a warrior when changing into new flight clothes)</p>
<p>"Tonight, let's bring big sausages as souvenirs and attend the enemy's party."</p>
<p>"At that time, if you say good evening and don't go in, the enemy will say that Japanese pilots are guys who don't understand etiquette!" (Jokes between warriors)</p>
<p>"Hey, please record my last moments well!" (Words of a Kamikaze corps member smiling and patting a comrade from the direct cover team)</p>
<p>"They sweetly ate rice balls wrapped in bamboo leaves and daily field dishes, without thinking that this was the last supper. After the meal, each person wrote their name and the word 'product' on the bag containing their scattered personal belongings...They gathered in front of the command post and then wrote their farewell words in front of the commander, wrapping their heads in headbands. Those who didn't have cloth asked the infirmary for some to bring out as headbands." (Remarks from So-and-so large shooter at the farewell)</p>
<p>"Even if this body is sacrificed in the South Sea, my soul will still linger on the spring of my youth." (Waka of Yonezaki Flight Petty Officer of the Shikishima Team)</p>
<p>"Without caring for one's body, knowing the task is heavy, wholeheartedly destroying the enemy's body." (Shown to comrades by Taniichi Flight Petty Officer of the Shikishima Team on the day of departure)</p>
<p>"This body would rather perish with the aircraft, vowing not to rest until the enemy ship is sunk." (Same as above)</p>
<p>"Don't be in a hurry, the opportunity will come!" (Remarks made by Commander So-and-so because there were too many volunteers to join the Kamikaze corps)</p>
<p>"It's really annoying not to become a Kamikaze corps member! Because the enemy's rampant behavior is too unbearable." (Words of a warrior who was not assigned to the Kamikaze corps)</p>
<p>Explanation by Captain Shiota: (1) When Marshal Togo of Japan was the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, he wrote the words "Kamikaze" with the meaning of "divine blessing and assistance." Therefore, the word "Kamikaze" has long been imprinted in the beliefs of the Japanese people. The Japanese people and the Japanese Army and Navy have extreme faith in Marshal Togo, honoring him as a "sacred general."</p>
<p>(2) The instructions of the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet to the members of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the words and deeds of the warriors in the above text fully express the spirit of the Japanese Navy. According to the Japanese Kamikaze spirit, it has existed since ancient times. For example, before the Kamakura Shogunate era, there was a battle between the "Minamoto" and "Taira" armies. The famous general Saito of the "Minamoto" army, who was nearly seventy years old, feared that the enemy would see his white hair and withered appearance and not engage in battle with him. Therefore, he specially dyed his hair, dressed up, and set off after wearing the clothes of a young man. This kind of spirit is indeed an original Japanese spirit.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the naming of the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, "Shikishima" and "Yamato" both represent Japan, "Asahi" represents the sun, and "Yamazakura" is a cherry blossom. Cherry blossoms bloom fully when they bloom and wither completely when they wither, representing purity, unity, and revitalization. "Kikusui" is a chrysanthemum, and chrysanthemums represent the imperial flower of Japan. Previously, during the Northern and Southern Dynasties of Japan, the imperial power was weak, and the counties and states were unruly. At that time, there was Masashige Kusunoki, who, seeing the situation, bravely overthrew the counties and presented the Kikusui flag to the Japanese Emperor. Later, the county soldiers rose up again. At this time, Kusunoki had already died, and his son inherited his will and pacified the county rebellion, also presenting the Kikusui flag. As for "Chuyu," "Giretsu," "Junchu," "Shisei," and "Seichu," they are all named in honor of loyalty to the Emperor. Also, "Tenpei" means the Emperor's soldiers, "Sakura" is a flower respected by Japan, and "Sakon" is a flower near the Imperial Palace, all containing the meaning of respecting the Imperial Family.</p>

<h3>Repairing the Millstone</h3>
<p>— Shi Ting</p>
<p>The millstone heart suddenly fell off. After fixing it with fish glue, it became loose again after shaking it a few times. The owner said to me:</p>
<p>"Keep an eye out for a millstone repairman. Call him in to fix it!"</p>
<p>My boss is a Ningbo woman, good looking but greedy. She calculates everything carefully, afraid of losing out and wanting to take advantage of others. I've worked for her for two years, and I've only just learned some of her shrewdness - when dispensing water, the tap is turned on very little, and it takes a long time to fill a pot. At night, she brings the coal briquettes into the room to prevent tenants from stealing them, etc. This is also a rare thing for her. In the past, she would change a servant almost every three months, and it was often an "unhappy breakup." When she eats a good meal, she doesn't allow the rice bucket to be taken to the kitchen. The servant has to go inside to get a bowl at a time. Think about it, this is really embarrassing. She sits next to the rice bucket, and you've filled the bowl three times, but you've only filled a corner of your stomach. You're embarrassed to fill it again. She uses this method to limit the amount of rice the servants eat. We who do physical labor can't succeed if we don't eat enough. We often steal food after meals, and naturally, she finds out, and immediately there's a quarrel. Then, we shoulder our bedding and scram, which is the biggest reason why she often changes servants. She often changes servants because of crimes such as using coal briquettes sparingly or putting men's tops and women's trousers in the same bucket when washing clothes. When it was my turn to work at her house, I ate miscellaneous foods such as third-grade flour and corn flour. The restriction on eating was lifted. I don't like changing bosses. All the crows in the world are black, all the same. As long as there is food to eat, that's fine. When I'm free, she calls me to watch the children, grind wheat, and corn flour, which I don't object to. Therefore, I've been able to work for more than a year. She's been dissatisfied with me only recently.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, one day, I brought an old man back from the street. He was dressed in rags, carrying a cloth bag, and walked with a dragging of broken shoes, not very energetic. I thought, this old man hasn't had anyone patronize his business for a long time.</p>
<p>"Can you repair millstones?" I asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"If I couldn't repair millstones, why would you call me here?" What a stubborn old man!</p>
<p>I led him into the room and carried out the millstone. He tapped the millstone heart and asked;</p>
<p>"Is it a 'hidden millstone'? The grain won't come out!"</p>
<p>I said, "It takes a lot of effort to grind!"</p>
<p>"Who said 'hidden millstone'!" The owner glared at me. "How much does it cost to fix the millstone heart? Tell me."</p>
<p>"'Hidden' or not, it's none of my business." The old man said, sizing it up, "How much did you buy this millstone for?"</p>
<p>"A hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>"Then, let's make it a hundred yuan!"</p>
<p>The owner jumped up, complaining that the labor cost was too expensive, but the millstone repairman wouldn't do it for less. He shouldered his cloth bag and was about to leave when the owner stopped him again.</p>
<p>"Then forge it again, how much in total?"</p>
<p>"Two hundred yuan!" The old man said, "To be honest, it's useless to fix the millstone heart without forging this millstone."</p>
<p>The old man advised the owner to forge the millstone, but the owner suspected him, afraid that he would take advantage. So she still wanted him to just fix the millstone heart.</p>
<p>"Sixty yuan is enough!" she said. "It cost a hundred yuan to buy, it costs sixty yuan to fix the millstone heart!"</p>
<p>"Your mother is a … How much does fish glue cost at a time? Ten yuan is probably not enough, right? However, it will fall off before grinding a millstone head. This millstone of yours is like renting it." He walked to the door and turned back, "Ninety yuan, how about that?"</p>
<p>"Eighty yuan! Quick and easy!" the owner said. The old man agreed, carried the millstone out of the back door, and started working with his hammer and chisel.</p>
<p>"Seventy yuan, seventy yuan, how about that?" the owner suddenly interrupted him.</p>
<p>"We've already agreed, and you're changing your mind again!" The old man threw down the hammer. "Go ask A'gen, who sells rice cakes, eighty yuan won't make you lose out."</p>
<p>The owner really went to ask A'gen. The old man grumbled and continued working.</p>
<p>"I've never seen such a suspicious person!" he said.</p>
<p>"You don't know, she's a pain when she buys vegetables!" After haggling over the price and weighing it, she either complains that the vegetables aren't good or asks the seller to add two more handfuls. The vegetable seller refuses, annoyed by her fussiness, and simply tells her not to buy it. But she's reluctant. Several times I've seen her arguing with people!"</p>
<p>The owner came back. She said to the old man, "Do a good job. Forge it well. It won't do if it still takes a lot of effort to grind after spending so much money."</p>
<p>The old man asked in surprise, "Did you say you wanted to forge it? I've been advising you for a long time."</p>
<p>"Huh! As soon as you came, I told you to fix the millstone heart, forge it." the owner said shrilly, "Are you deaf, old man? Didn't we agree on eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart and forge the millstone?"</p>
<p>"You vile whore!" the old man cursed, "Eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart and forge the millstone? I've eaten two hundred thousand yuan worth of rice without anything to do! Heaven is above, are you afraid of being struck by lightning!"</p>
<p>"Rice cake stall owner, you be the judge!" the owner said "My millstone is a 'hidden millstone'. If I don't ask him to forge it, is it useful just to fix the millstone heart?"</p>
<p>The stall owner smiled and said nothing.</p>
<p>The old man cursed, repeating the details just now to the stall owner, then turned to the owner:</p>
<p>"If you have the guts, kneel down and swear together. Whichever one of us is lying and has no conscience, may that one die tonight!"</p>
<p>"You old thief!" the owner trembled with anger, "You're still lying after living to such an old age. I asked A'gen, it costs eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart. Do you think I'm stupid? ... If you don't want to do it, you can leave!" She pulled the millstone inside.</p>
<p>"Tell me to leave? How convenient." The old man suddenly pulled the millstone out: "My efforts are wasted!"</p>
<p>The old man赖蒲 wouldn't leave and wanted to call the police.</p>
<p>"I'll give you ten yuan!" The owner gave him money, telling me to carry the millstone in.</p>
<p>At first, the millstone repairman refused to stop and wouldn't let me carry it in. Later, the stall owner gave him face, and he finally said,</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the stall owner's face, I would have had to call the police." So he packed up, dragging his broken shoes away.</p>
<p>I carried the millstone in, and the owner suddenly started crying and scolding me.</p>
<p>"It's all your fault. You brought such a thief to bully me. Get out!" Since she wasted ten yuan, she</p>
<p>"Blame yourself! Who told you to be so suspicious? We agreed on eighty yuan to fix the millstone heart. You wanted to bully the old man. You're shameless!" I scolded angrily. I knew she had long intended to fire me.</p>
<p>"You...you dare to scold me?" she stamped her feet "Heaven and earth bear witness, as soon as he came, I told him to forge the millstone, fix the millstone heart, eighty yuan just to fix the millstone heart, am I that stupid?"</p>
<p>I ignored her and shouldered my bedding and left that night.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Basketball League: Discussing the Zhongbei vs. Hualian Match; Group B Repechage to Begin... Adding Women's Championship</h3>
<p>Following the Zhongbei victory over Hualian in the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League Group A on the 4th (Monday), the two teams now have equal points. Apart from the rematch, all other matches have been completed. Each match was extremely smooth, worthy of praise! The six sections of Group B have also concluded successfully, with champions determined for each section. Let's first discuss the Zhongbei vs. Hualian match.</p>
<p>The Zhongbei vs. Hualian Showdown Yielded Satisfactory Results</p>
<p>Due to the attractiveness of the Zhongbei vs. Hualian match, and to maintain order and support the scholarship fund, this newspaper temporarily increased ticket prices. Enthusiastic fans, wanting to appreciate the skills and willingly accept the outcome, competed to attend, creating an unprecedented lively scene. Moreover, good order was maintained throughout, which is the greatest achievement. Both teams strived to display their skills during the match, taking it seriously and exhibiting clear and admirable movements without any violent behavior. They showed absolute obedience to the referee, adding much color to the league. This newspaper feels boundless excitement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Zhongbei's Sudden Change in Strategy Frustrated Hualian</p>
<p>Given the brilliance of this match, the writer will tirelessly discuss the key to the victory of both teams again, with the aim of fostering further improvement when they meet again in future matches.</p>
<p>Zhongbei adopted the same lineup as described in the previous article. On one hand, they took advantage of their height for passing and stealing the ball. On the other hand, they spared no effort in making arrangements against the pivot player. For example, Zhao Yalin was assigned to closely guard Kong Guangyi, which was a brilliant move. Kong was a key contributor to Hualian's scores, while Zhao was not expected to score points himself. Therefore, Zhao spared no effort in restraining Kong from shooting, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Zhongbei's sudden switch to an absolute man-to-man defense was initially unexpected. Observing Zhongbei's previous matches, they often appeared to lack endurance, even their five-man zone defense seemed exceptionally lax. Therefore, at the beginning of the match, the tight man-to-man marking led many to believe that they would not be able to maintain it to the end. Who would have thought that the players would become braver and braver as the game progressed, completely changing their demeanor until the end, combined with their agile shots and superb skills, they deserved to win. Judging by individual performances, everyone contributed more than they made mistakes, it's not that they are being praised after the victory. Li Zhenzhong not only guarded Bo Tuo, but also repeatedly sought opportunities to attack, which is commendable. The contest between Li Baozhong and Xian Lun was also extremely intense. Chen Xuesui's disappointment with his low score is a misunderstanding. Xuesui's goal was to contain Wu Chengzhang. Wu is the soul of Hualian's ball acquisition, and restricting his opportunities to get the ball is Xuesui's success. Shen Yugong seemed slightly lax on Qu Xilin, but conversely, Xilin was also relatively loose. Therefore, both Shen and Qu scored many points. Yugong's wonderful shooting should also be listed as a contribution. Zhao Yalin's tight marking of Kong Guangyi was a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Hualian's lineup was also as described in the previous article. However, their tactical failure cannot be concealed. The main reason is that they did not expect Zhongbei to adopt a man-to-man defense, so they were constantly pressed. Although they temporarily discussed changing methods, the application was not yet skillful, failing to achieve remarkable results. When they meet again, they should seek countermeasures in all aspects of tactics and conduct appropriate training. With Hualian's past spirit, there is still great hope. It is believed that breaking man-to-man defense requires extremely agile and skilled screening techniques to succeed. It was mentioned in an article during the previous Western Youth League competition that Hualian utilized screening techniques too little. To this day, this remains true. Furthermore, the substitutions in the second half of the day were correct, but the focus was wrong. Replacing Zhang Xianlun with Fan Qinggong and Kong Guangyi with Zhang Liangxiong was intended to allow Fan and Zhang to both make long shots, hoping to save the situation. However, having Fan guard Zhao Yalin and Zhang guard Chen Xuesui, aiming to confuse the opponent's targets, was indeed reasonable. However, Zhao was ultimately a sacrificial player, so wouldn't that also be sacrificing Fan? When Xuesui is attacking more often, how can Liangxiong have the opportunity to shoot from afar? Does Hualian agree?</p>
<p>Re-match Today: Various Sectors Request a Three-Game Series</p>
<p>The date of the rematch between the two teams is of great interest to all parties. It is scheduled to be decided and announced today at the League Committee meeting. Furthermore, many parties have submitted letters requesting that the rematch adopt a best-of-three series format, hoping to see two more good games. Their reason is to seek a fair competition to determine the skill level, so that both sides have no chance of luck and no grounds for complaint. If ticket revenue increases, underprivileged students will benefit even more. What will actually happen depends on the final decision of today's committee.</p>
<p>Group B's Six Section Champions Repechage Date to be Set Separately</p>
<p>(Group B Section 1) Renyu, having defeated strong rivals Jingsheng, not only seized the section championship but also has hopes of vying for the overall championship. Most of its members have represented Group A, making them superior.</p>
<p>(Group B Section 2) With the withdrawal of Dahua, the Pang team secured the top spot, with its members feeling elated and ambitious. Their old partner Dong Yangfeng, who recently came to Shanghai from West Lake, is rumored to be staying for a while, which deserves our attention.</p>
<p>(Group B Section 3) With Liu Hesheng's earnest teaching, Qingxie's skills are improving daily. The team members are all young and motivated, having won the section crown, they will strive for further advancement in the repechage.</p>
<p>(Group B Section 4) The Shan team's young players inherited the style of Group A, known for their fast attacks. Their victory over Moore in Section 4 demonstrated their strength. We can wait and see what they will achieve in the future.</p>
<p>(Group B Section 5) Morning Friends Blue has won all five games, all very smoothly. Judging by their results, they don't seem to be top-notch, but their players have ample experience and many strategies, so they are not a team to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>(Group B Section 6) The Zhongbei team also has the same style as Group A. They seem to lack strength, but they always have clever moves in tense matches. Is this really the Zhongbei style? They beat Lingyou the other day, and the players all put in effort. Their performance in the subsequent repechage will determine their success or failure.</p>
<p>As for the schedule of the Group B repechage, it will be announced soon.</p>
<p>Women's Registration Begins: Hoping for Enthusiastic Participation</p>
<p>During the Group B repechage, the league will insert a women's group, both to increase interest and to promote women's sports. Registration has now begun and will close on December 12th. It is hoped that all female teams will enthusiastically participate to support the event. It is fortunate that teams such as Green, Sanxing, Peimin, and Chongde are all preparing, and should be able to join and showcase their skills as scheduled. Furthermore, Shanghai Girls' High School has always strongly promoted physical education, and its volleyball team has achieved outstanding results. They should be able to muster their forces this time. Among the talents, there are veterans such as Zhang Jiafan, Cheng Hongsheng, and Zhu Shifang with rich experience, and rising stars such as Zhang Minyu and Weng Hanqing with athletic talent. If they have this good opportunity, they should not easily miss it.</p>
<h3>Essentials of Basketball Theory (6)</h3>
<p>— Liang Zhao'an</p>
<p>(C) Shooting</p>
<p>Shooting is the ultimate goal in a team competition, so every player must be proficient in it. If a team's shooting skills are poor, it cannot adopt an offensive strategy in the competition, but can only resort to defense, hoping that the opponent scores less, and cannot hope for victory. The reasoning is clear. Conversely, if a team's shooting skills are excellent, the entire team's confidence will be firm, their spirits will be high, and their momentum will be strong. They can launch rapid attacks and shoot at any time, and their chances of winning will be superior.</p>
<p>To shoot accurately, one must be accurate in judging distance, speed of movement, direction and angle, and height of the shot, as well as having accurate judgment. Distance and direction must be carefully considered and cannot have the slightest error. As for the height of the shot, it can vary. Some are accustomed to using high-arcing shots, while others are accustomed to using lower-arcing shots. But regardless of the height of the arc, every shot must be higher than the hoop. If a player is accustomed to a certain height of shooting, even if this height does not conform to correct theory, the instructor should only see if this type of shot is mostly successful, and not force them to change it, otherwise it will only make them less accurate. If a player often makes the mistake of shooting too far or too short, it is clearly due to weak judgment, and it should be corrected immediately, making them practice more during peacetime, correcting their mistakes, and checking their eyesight to see if they have farsightedness or nearsightedness. When shooting, if the body's center of gravity is not stable, or the standing position is poor, it is better to pass the ball to a teammate than to force a shot, because a missed shot will easily allow the opponent to take the ball.</p>
<p>Every player should be familiar with various shooting methods, and should not only be familiar with one or two, or only seek their own specialty, and be satisfied with hitting every shot, and not practice other methods. It must be known that the more complete the shooting method, the more opportunities there are to get a shot. Personal stunts, although rare and valuable, are admired. But it can only be done occasionally. If it is used frequently, it is easy for people to see through, it is not surprising, and it is easy for the opponent to defend, so that the trick cannot be used again. There are many shooting methods, which cannot all be described here. Now I extract the more commonly used ones and describe them as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Chest Push Shot</p>
<p>This shooting method involves holding the ball with both hands, fingers spread apart, on both sides of the ball, and pushing it out in front of the chest. The palms should not touch the ball, the ball should be held firmly, but not too tightly, otherwise it will not be flexible. Stand with your feet stably in front of each other, making your bones more relaxed naturally; the center of gravity of your body must be kept average; when shooting, bend your knees and squat down, move the ball and put it in your abdomen, and let your elbows hang down close to your body. At this time, the body should be sent up with the ball, and the spirit should rise, this action must be faster than squatting down, and the whole body, hands and feet should cooperate, and it should be soft and rhythmic. When the body is squatting, both eyes should focus on the basket or the place where the ball should hit the board; when the ball rises to the chest, both hands should send the ball out, and when shooting, both backs of the hands should be facing your face, and your palms should be open to the basket, and use your fingers and wrist strength to push the ball out. After the ball is pushed out, the arms must still extend straight along the path of the ball, and both eyes should focus on the basket or the board until the ball has entered the basket, or touched the board and bounced out. At the same time, the body must be prepared to follow up, so as to jump up and recapture the ball and shoot again, or pass it to a teammate.</p>
<p>(2) Shoulder Lift Shot</p>
<p>Usually, this shooting method is mostly used when closely guarded by the opponent near the basket, so it is not an attack if you are not familiar with it. The method of shooting it in is the same as the general passing method. But it is mostly a shot that hits the board and bounces into the basket. The place where the ball hits the board is very important. It should be half a foot higher than the basket and done at the corner where the basket and the board intersect. When practicing this shooting method at ordinary times, you should develop a prescribed route to walk to the corner of the basket. This route should form a 45-degree angle with the end line. And you must walk to a place six feet away from the basket, then jump up, the closer the body jumps to the basket, the more accurately it will be shot. After the body jumps up, use one hand or both hands to lift the ball over the shoulder and throw it into the basket. This gripping shooting method can be performed at the front and left and right corners of the basket. Every player should be so familiar with the place that if they shoot ten times, they must hit it more than eight times before they can be considered qualified. In fact, shooting in this place should be regarded as an area where you will never lose the shot. If you do not hit the basket in this area during the game when there is no opponent's defense, it is really unforgivable. You should be strictly punished by the instructor and ordered to practice hard again.</p>
<p>(3) Hook Shot</p>
<p>This shooting method is the same as the hook pass method; it is mostly used after rotating and when using a blocking strategy. When shooting, first turn around to avoid the person hitting the ball, then turn around and jump up, and shoot with the hook pass method; if you can fake passing to the left and right and forward after turning around, or pat the ball and rush forward one step, then it will be very clever, making the opponent unpredictable. However, this shooting method cannot be performed beyond six or seven feet away from the basket. If it exceeds this limit, it will mostly be inaccurate and easy for the opponent to easily get the ball that is touched by the board and bounced out. Therefore, it should not be done unless you are familiar with it.</p>
