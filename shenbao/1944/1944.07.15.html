<p>社評</p>
<h3>再貢獻於商統會</h3>
<p>全國商業通知總會前天舉行第二次理監會議，確定內部組織改組事宜，今後工作，應有更新精神的開展，克盡國家賦予，人民期待的統制使命。我們對於商統會巳有兩度獻議，六月十六日社評提出希望四點，期待商統會本身的改善。七月八日社評，列舉統制經濟辦理成效的必要條件，並提出三點以期商統會之其附屬機關的共同努力。茲再就觀感所及，論列如此：</p>
<p>目前商統會的性能，既已規定不辦實際統制工作，而對於所屬的五個委員會負綜合聯絡與審核監督之責。這在實質上，對於五個委員會實際統制工作的動向如何，商統會應加過問。換言之，五委員會實際工作的成效如何，商統會應負連帶責任。所以，商統會絕不是僅僅承轉的空頭機關。如果商統會是徒具形式的承轉機關，這是根本多餘的駢枝機關，又何必有此累贅。</p>
<p>商統會既然不是空頭承轉機關，我們就希望有「名符其實」的權與能，然後課以應負的責任。我們認爲：</p>
<p>第一，商統會與所屬的五委員會，必須保持經常的密切的聯絡，在一個統制原則之下分工合作。我們說過，五委員會之間，無論在組織，人事，設施方面，應步伐一致，不能有脫離商統會而各自爲政的脫軌現象。現在我們更建議，在商統會內設置類似的「統治工作聯絡會議」，由商統會及五委員會指派高級幹部若干人組織，經常討論實施工作的聯絡事宜。商統會理監事會議是決定大政的原則的。這會議是專討論聯絡工作的，使彼此之間絕無各自爲政的隔膜現象。</p>
<p>第二，五委員會對於行政院及其他上級機關的行文，自應由商統會承轉。同時，五委員會本身之重要措置，也應先經商統會的同意，這在組織上職權上是應有的範疇·如果某一委員會的重要措置可以不通過商統會而逕向行政院呈謂決定，那末，很可能這一措置到了實施時，商統會仍無所知，豈非笑話。過去的例不必舉，最近傳聞粉麥委員會自商統會新理事長接事後，其問毫無接觸，猶如各不相干的對立機關。無論在組織系統上，人民的觀瞻上，都是不合理的，政府及商統會當局應即糾正。同時，我們要問，粉麥統制委員會這樣做，未知憑藉了什麼根據？</p>
<p>第三，盟邦日本對於中國的經濟統制，既已信賴中國人士以自治精神辦理，在行政上，就希望中國單獨的負起絕對責任辦理。一方面，在商統會及五委員會立塲，自亦不能忽視盟邦當局的意見，關於統制政策以及重要措置，尤應在事前取得密切聯絡，充分協力。而在中國人的辦事態度上，既不應唯唯否否，惟命是從，亦不能不加理會，而應誠懇坦白相互商討，共以爭取大東亞戰爭勝利爲原則，在此原則下兩國合作充分協力。</p>
<p>最後，我們所諄諄不忘者，就是用人唯才主義，過去失敗經騐，就在人事不健全，所以，我們竭力主張商統會應設人事委員會，專門負甄選與考核之責，尤其新進人員，不合標準絕不勉强錄用。其次，統制經濟在我國是新事業，必須採用新的科學方法隨時適應環境。統制工作雖重實施，但在實施之前，尤應有完善的計劃以爲根據。</p>

<p>褚外長義代辦談話</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　外交部褚部長，對於義國交還天津專管租界，撤廢在華治外法權，及駐兵權智協定簽字，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>「去年一月十一日義大利政府毅然繼日本政府之後，自動發表放棄在華租界行政權，及撒廢治外法權之聲明，旋即於三月廿九日，簽定中義兩國關於交收北平公使館區域行政權之協定。三月卅日實施移交，七月廿三日復簽定關於實施收回上海公獎租界之條款，八月一日實施移交。惟天津義國專管租界，則因準備需時，迄未實施交收，故各國在華之租界，未曾收回者，僅些一處耳。</p>
<p>茲以義大利社會共和國政府，於墨索里尼元首領導之下，早經成立，我國亦早已承認，是已恢復正常之邦交，爰於本年二月間，電令我駐日本大使蔡培，就近與義國駐日代辦比林齊比尼商討，補行追認交收手續。當時該代辦亦正奉到義國政府命令，飭其負查與我國協議，先經蔡大使數度磋商，意見極爲接近，復乘本部長赴日恭候主席政朝康復之便，親與新任義國駐華代辦施畢納利，及駐日代辦協商就緒，幷將協定草案，呈奉最高國防會議通過，茲定於七月十四日，由本部長與義代辦，代表中義兩國政府，將中華民國義大利國問，關於收交天津專管租界，撤廢在華治外法權，及駐兵權之協定，正式簽字。</p>
<p>各國在華設設置租界，已有近百年之歷史，始作俑者，實爲英國。今幸盟邦日本首先倡議交還租界，法國亦自動繼起實踐，今義國常已簽訂協定，幷於簽訂協定日起實施交收，故此租界二字，即行消滅，成爲歷史上之名詞，百年來畸形制度，亦即掃除凈盡，自今以後，我國領土依舊完整，我國主權依舊獨立，是則今日中義協定之簽訂，其有助我國之復興，實非淺鮮。</p>
<p>義國政府值茲戰爭緊張之際，竟將七十餘年午我國享有之權益，毅然實施放棄，其國際道義之精神，不獨爲中義邦交史上最燦爛光明之一頁，亦又國政府與人民永資感　者也。</p>
<p>我政府收回該租界之後，對於管理經營，自當力求完善俾留住界內之義國人民，依舊安居樂業，而愈益增進其福祉，以馴答義國政府之盛意。」</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　義代辦施舉納利談話：義大利社會共和國政府之於中華民國，素抱有深切之了解，及至誠之友誼·溯自汪主席閣下領導之國民政府成立以來，本關元首墨索里尼，迭經表示對於正在蓬勃建設中之新興中國，極端協助與欣欽。是以義大利社會共和國政府，對於同盟之貴國，儘先提出交還天津義大利租界，放棄治外法權，及廢除在華駐兵權之建義。今日簽訂協定後，法西斯義大利共和政府，放棄在華之一切特權，此舉實對於中義兩國之邦交，開一新紀元，若此密切之合作，余深信更能激勵吾等同盟國之英武民族，爲世界眞正自由及正義而戰者，必獲得最後之勝利。</p>

<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討</h3>
<p>行政收買是非</p>
<p>米統會所主持的米糧收買，是採用所謂供出制的。即由省政府至縣政府，由縣政府至各區公所，由各區公所至鄉村，規定應負責供給於米統會指定商號所收買的數量。一般所說的行政收買，並不是指行政機關本身實施收買，而指由於全面活用行政力的各商號實施收買。關於這行政收買的是非，應繼續或應廢棄的問題，在上海已由各方面表示種稱意見。如就棉花而言，絕對不採用行政收買方式，已發衷爲對農民的委約，其他主耍農產物亦取同樣的方式。關於米糧，在撤廢移動限制，實施臨時措置鋼要等等之後，很多人力主或預料行政收買即將全部廢棄。自由收買，或行政收買，是決定收賀成果的基本問題，不是可輕易談論的，記者歷訪內地的結果，更相信行政收買的方式，縱需全面的改善，也不必廢來定額供出制。這是與一般所主張的米糧自由收買論相對立的意見，米糧問題的特異性，與內地米糧收買的實情，愈使記者堅持道意見。自由收買論者僅重視行政收買的惡劣面，而忽視自由收買方式所必致的混亂與弊寶。對此，我們反對用新的缺陷來填補舊的缺陷，而想在革新現行制度的努力中，打開今後收買米糧的道路。前面已經說過，在米糧收買的推進上，軍事力，政治力，經濟力三位一體的協力是絕對必要的·那不是像靠自由主義的純經濟行爲所能改良的性質上的間題·在不適現狀的抽象論上，及不可見的經濟技術面之修正上，發見根本革新政治力的具體對策之收買方式論，從最現實的，最具體的上面看來，其實際是最觀念的，最抽象的方式。我們痛感根本革新實施了幾年的方式之道，始是最適應內地農村的治安，與政治及經濟現實的方法。</p>
<p>修正收買方法</p>
<p>供出制度，事實上確有許多應改革的弊寶·尤以米統會的不澈底的收買方針，爲害更深。但其修正的努力，現在不是簡單的理論問題，從三月至四月，在各地實踐的結果，獲得了許多寶貴的敎訓。例如大胆採用指定收買商號與農民之問的直接現金就地立即交換制等，對一般農民有預料以上的影響·這一種經騐，今後不應由於儘量活用的抽象的自由收買論所掩葬·記者在松江，崑山，蘇州，無錫儘量聽取各方面對此問題的意見與體騐，茲綜合其主要各點以供參考。第一，廢除一年間絕對不變更的固定價格制，而採用地域性的，時間性的，機動性的高價格制·</p>
<p>用市價二分之一，三分之一的價格收買米糧的方式，常然不能再採用·米統會當其初創時本不擬採此方針，而欲以當時市價收買。我們巳經屢次指出，米統會發表收買價格時，比各主要集散地的市價高得多。但這時期並沒有實行收買，而私運，囤積者則競以較米統會價格略高的價值實行收買，搬出；待米統會開始全面的收買時，價格的相差已經很鉅。這種事態，今後不能再重演了。內地價格現在已達〇〇元時，如用較低於此的廉値收買，顯然將產生較去年更深刻的結果·應該用富於機動性的高價格政策，從收割時到廢歷新正止，實行迅速果斷的收買。</p>
<p>因高價格政策而致收買預算趨於龐大的問題，不是在直接的收買方面所能解決的問題。應從另一角度在國府的金融政策上設法解決，（譯自六月二十四日大陸新報）</p>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　日機十三日晨會再發製擊桂林機塲，使渝美機八十九架起火燃燒，炸毀其軍事設施八處，此實爲作戰以來罕有之戰果。最近彼等爲挽回頹勢，特於粵漢綫之兩側之芷江·桂林·丹竹等地建設空軍基地，企圖死守，渝美空軍自長沙·湘潭·衡陽各機塲相繼失陷後，爲挽回頹勢，計至十二日業將西南地區各基地之空軍刀集結於桂林，然早爲日方偵知，故十三日晨日機送先發制人，展開攻勢，急襲桂林，結果渝機八十九架幾全被炸毀，軍事設施八處亦全被破壞，且日機並無損害。計七月一日迄今，渝美機被擊落擊毀及起火燃燒者，實達二百八十架之多，故渝美空軍實已陷重大危機。</p>
<p>大陸基地十四日中央電社　日轟炸機隊，十四日上午三時空襲廣西省丹竹機塲，冒渝軍猛烈之防空砲火，投下巨彈多枚，陸上渝機及附屬施設中彈起火，日機完成任務後，安返基地。</p>
<h3>衡陽戰事熾烈　已達最高潮　日空軍機隊大行活躍</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局十三日夜發表戰况公報稱，衡陽戰事之熾烈，己達最高潮。</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日軍在中國大陸戰綫所會動之主要攻勢，節節進展，片刻不停，粵漢綫日軍之南下部隊，突破衡陽南方之耒陽一帶之戰綫，北上部隊進逼運江附近，兩部隊相隔僅有二百五十公里，中國大陸上之日空軍機隊，亦協力陸上作戰之進展，而連日大行活躍，自日軍開始主要攻勢以來，擊落擊毀及焚毀敵機共逢六百架，計四月中四十架，五月中百六十架，六月中二百架，如此赫赫結果，實足驚人。入七月後，日空軍機隊愈發揮其猛　，七日至十三日之九日間，一舉嚴滅敵機一〇六架，此次奇襲芷江，擊毀焚燬敵機五十一架，如將四月以降之戰果一併計算，摧毀敵機實在五百五十七架以上，頃日空軍更以敵空軍之前進基地作爲自方之前進基地，據大活躍地域，蓋日軍於華北巳攻陷洛陽，覆減盧氏飛機塲，於華中·華南更有捲長沙，收衛陽飛機塲於掌中，就中佔領衡陽飛機塲之意我，尤爲重大。因該地爲維中，華南地區敵軍各基地之連絡中樞，該地一失，則東方之建甌，遂川，玉山，麗水等基地。完全失却連絡，即西方之零陵，部陽等各基地，亦因日空軍機隊以衛陽，長沙爲基地，大行活躍之故，而歸於無力，是迫使新方不得不將空軍之主力退至以昆明爲中心之西南內地，以成都爲中心之西北內地，而以向來祖負第二綫根據地使命之桂林，丹竹，芷江等基地，作爲對付日軍之第一綫按建。　距桂林八百五十公里，洛陽距成都九百三十公里，是則駐渝美空軍之第一錢基地竟後退將近一千公里。駐渝美空軍所以予大東亞戰開始以來，極力將第一綫基地向中國次陸東部推進者，目的有二，其一，當係企圖空裂日本本土，並威脅西太平洋日本之海上輪送，另一目的則有欲將太平洋戰綫尼米資攻勢誘至中國東南沿海之意，故刻下衡陽以東各第一綫基地之削弱無力，使敵軍之對日戰略受重大打擊。駐渝美空軍爲恐基地之後退影響駐渝美空軍存在之價值，最近特於桂林，芷江，丹竹等基地調集多數飛機，有死守此一條空軍陣綫之勢，但多數第一綫飛機，旋因日機之連日奇鑿而殘破不全，駐渝美空軍素來以保持第一綫飛襪有六七百架之目標，日空軍三個月中收獲之五百五十七架之戰果，正相當於駐渝美空軍第一綫飛機之全部，此種幾乎全軍覆沒之現狀，恐自負物資覺實之美國，亦不能輕視。駐渝美空軍指揮官捷諾特，正大聲急呼謂，日軍欲沿北平至廣州長二千三百公里之鐵路建築一條長大之防綫，此種雄心如果真能實現，則駐渝美空軍當深受打擊，而戰爭之結束，更須延遲數年。</p>
<h3>趙殿文連長　壯烈犧牲</h3>
<p>太原十四日中央社電　壯烈陣亡之山西某軍部隊連長趙殿文上尉，因剿匪有功，特連進二級，升爲上校，此乃中國軍未有之榮譽。當五月三十日爲掩護陣地之權案，趙上尉赴潞安西北黃砂山，從事警戒時，突破以新編第一旅爲基幹之匪團約三千七百人包鬨，趙上尉突入敵陣五次，終將敵衆擊退，而趙連長亦壯烈陣亡。是役敵之死傷不下九百，鹵獲步槍五十支，其他軍需品甚多，趙上校實爲同生共死之模範軍人也。</p>
<h3>緬甸靑年　致日靑年書</h3>
<p>仰光十四日中央社電　緬甸東亞靑年聯盟總裁烏巴基揚氏，於該聯盟創立二周年紀念日，在東京緬大使館與重光外相會談，傳達緬甸靑年致日本靑年之書信，其內容如次：當茲東亞靑年聯盟二週年紀念日，我等緬甸靑年對日本靑年，謹以至誠致欽仰之意。我等緬甸靑年於此次大東亞戰爭期內，已相率携手，期使全東亞從盎格魯撤克遜人之壓迫與支配下解放，誓將共同之敵人完全擊滅。</p>
<h3>敵軍砲擊　迭尼安島</h3>
<p>中部太平洋基地十四日中央社電十是那日畫間，敵艦艇及塞班島敵陣地之砲火，對迭尼安島猛射，敵驅逐艦羣，亦於同日夜間砲擊該島。</p>
<h3>憲兵司令部　緝懲不肖軍人</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電中央憲兵兵司令部以時有不肖軍人，在京內違法亂紀，向商民人等籌索敲詐，經嚴行查察，倘仍有越軌行爲，即予拘部。被害人遇在此等不肖官兵，准予隨待控告，應送司令部聽候查究。</p>
<h3>日駐華北　各地公使會議　檢討物資糧食問題</h3>
<p>北京十四日中央社電　駐華日本大使館北京車務所，定於十四日上午九時半起，召開該管下公使館會義，藉以檢討物資之開發輸送，及購買食糧，及其他華北當前之重要問題。大使館方面醫澤公使以下各部長，關係長官，地方公使館方面，北京·天津·靑島·濟南·石門·大原·開對·各總領事，以及張店·唐山·各領事等，均將出席，此外徐州總領事，並亦將蒞席。</p>
<h3>財部令銀錢業　愼重放款</h3>
<p>南京十四日中央社電　財部本月六日，特令京滬兩地銀錢公會，轉飭各會員銀行錢莊，以後放款應依照原訂辦法，慎重處置。並通知中儲放款，嚴密考慮。倘有投機操縱者，決予嚴懲，必不使有用炎金，從事黃金市塲之操縱。至於大戶暗中操縱者，當局已分別嚴密澈查</p>
<h3>渝報指摘　英美無能</h3>
<p>北京十四日中央社電　西安渝方國民黨報（西京日報），會於最近論說中，指出歐洲侵歐戰綫之困難，同時更批評英美之無力，茲誌其大意如次：反軸心軍雖於歐洲展開侵歐戰綫，然對德軍之防禦，實不可輕視。反軸心軍攻取羅馬，曾費時七十二日，於歐洲大陸尚有其多如羅馬之要地，仍歸軸心軍掌握。對於此點吾人並須牢記，他方日本之大陸攻勢，依然熾烈，目下於豫湘及緬甸戰綫，刻正繼續血鬥，同時渝方日趨不利，現在仍不能阻止日軍之進擊。英美於開羅會談時，雖謂歐洲與遠東戰場，兩相聯繫，然現於大陸戰傷，美軍竟未行援助，此究係何故，若如斯遲延，則我等唯有減亡之一途。</p>
<p>重慶黨派繁多</p>
<p>里斯本十四自中央社電　據紐約來電，美國名記者皮亞遜，十人日於華盛頓會報撰文，對重慶政權內幕，加以揭穿，給與各方面極大衝動，其言如次：由重慶之外交報告，以及此次隨同副大總統訪渝之隨員等之傳說，觀之重慶，依然爲反軸心陣營中之一贅瘤。駐渝之美國記者，以受嚴審檢查之故，幾與監犯相同，美渝之關係當然無親善之可言，美國駐渝大使不能與蔣會面，蔣常托詞拒見，渝政權內部各黨各派，極爲活躍。渝方之軍閥官更，均憤恨宋美齡，宋所持者即爲美爾援助之軍需品，以對付共產黨。</p>
<h3>帝大敎授　調查各地棉產</h3>
<p>保定十四日中央社電　前南方司政長官，九州帝國大學敎授伊藤兆司傳士，及該校小山內懋助敎授，爲調查中國各地棉花黃麻苗麻等犠維資源，及一般農業狀况，日前自上海出發，赴南京湖州北平以及山東各地視察，於九日來保，翌日即行啟程，赴出西蒙疆地方視察。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據倫敦消息，克恩之東德軍反攻，已迫使英軍由科倫貝爾與聖特獲諾林二村撤退至奧納河與克恩運河之對岸。</p>
<h3>菲統制配給　由政府辦理</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十四日中央計電　日方爲實施將經濟諸權益讓與菲政府管理之契約，近又將前所管理之生活必需物炎配給統制事務，移交菲政府辦理。現菲方爲調整其組織計，特將過去之菲生活必需物資改組，另設立一充分之統制配給機關，國立商品勝買配給公司，該公司資金定爲一萬比索，於洛勒爾大總統直轄下經營事業，一面日方因菲生活必需物炎配給機關業已讓渡菲政府自力，故復將菲輸出入物資管理統制公會改組，新設非交易配給公會，分設交易配給部，擔任必需生活品及物資之開發配給，交易部辦理館輸出入物資管理公會之業務。</p>
<h3>德統帥視察防務戰事重心移桑洛　美軍反復攻勢遭遇堅強抵抗</h3>
<p>柏林十四口中央社電　據倫敦電構：德軍西部最高司令克魯格元帥，連日視察杜佛海峽沿岸，尤其鄧扣克與阿白維爾一帶之德軍陣地。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德軍當局十三日宜稱：北法戰事之中心，再度移至柯坦汀半蠢南部，美甚大損害，現在美軍之作戰目標轉尚桑洛及聖埃里斯，桑洛方面之敵軍擴大前日形成之小突出部，自東部及北部迫近桑洛，維爾河及柯坦汀半島西岸中間地萬之敵軍反復展開執拗攻勢，企圖包圍佩里耶。敵軍東方前進步隊沿維爾河到達朋愛員爾，西方前進部隊沿拉海杜布伊，萊　公路直進，刻已到達安格維爾，桑將爲第區附近，德戰軍一師與美戰軍三師對抗，德機甲部隊會奇襲敵軍背後擾亂敵陣，敵軍除向南方猛進外，復自東方試行反擊。其十二日之攻勢屢遭德軍反擊，未獲重要成果。</p>
<h3>飛彈不斷滋擾倫敦疏散人口</h3>
<p>沮里希十四日中央社電　德軍流星彈對倫敦市攻擊，十二日晚間一度停止，倫教市民，均以爲德軍基地已被英空軍炸燬，不能繼續發放，乃自十三日晨刻起，惱人之流星彈又源源飛來，於是市民一度稍安之心情又形緊張，紛紛疏散避難，是日有小學生及女學生約一萬三千人逃走，倫敦當局辦理疏散人口事宜手續不當，英國新聞界羣起非難。</p>
<h3>郭培爾闡明　德作戰目標　挽救歐洲文明免於破滅</h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德宜傳部長郭培爾，在德意志雜誌中發表論文稱：德國及其明國之作戰目的，與反軸心國相比較，則其與世界所希望之和平大爲接近，各國之所望者爲國家之進步·社會之改革·經濟之繁榮及安靜與快樂，此可以由於各國之努力而達到，斷不能由犧牲他國以獲得之。德國所望者，乃全世界所希望者一樣，若以德國言之，則不必訴諸戰爭，而仍可達到此項目的，倘敵人不迫德國作戰，則德國早已能達到此項目的，倘敵國之金融主義者及布爾希維克主義之領袖不作違反此意之行爲，則其目的之大部份亦可達到。倘反軸心軍獲勝，則祇有如英美政府所宣布之毀滅之程序，即任令共產黨之化歐洲爲地獄是也，快樂與興盛則無希望矣。敵人以凡爾贅條約以束縛德國，使德國歐洲及全世界陷於混亂者二十年，直至除戰爭以外並無他路，以自此悲境突出之時機之來臨，於此次戰爭中，德人從未有主張毀滅及破壞，並非自感其力之不足，實以文明爲着想矣。現祗有共產主義係懷有此項企颺，英人與蘇合作，無異於玩火之危也。克林姆宮自有其與英美相反之辦法，而英美實受斯達林智操縱，倘謂軍事上於反軸心有利，則僅代穌建設其進入歐洲之大路矣。</p>
<h3>土駐德大使　搭機歸國</h3>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　據安加拉電，土駐德大使亞利肯已於十三日搭機歸抵斯丹埠。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　海通社訊：美駐士大使史坦哈特已返美京，會進謁羅斯福總統商談。</p>
<p>里斯本十四日中央社電　美因對中立諸國之壓迫工作，最近愈趨顯　，美國內似有強化對中立國壓迫之主張。</p>
<h3>特戈爾返北非</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據倫敦消息，特戈爾將軍已於十三日傍晚由訪問美國與加拿大返抵阿爾及爾。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍　撤離維爾諾　蘇軍迫近立陶宛境</h3>
<p>柏林十四日由中央社電　德軍當局頃發表：維爾諾德軍澈底破壞各重要設施後撤退，現與德主力合流，是役德軍俘虜蘇軍甚多，又鹵獲武器甚夥，蘇軍所受損失極大，德軍則極輕微。</p>
<p>安加拉十四日中央社電　蘇聯昨夜發表文告稱：蘇軍已佔領雜爾諾，幷稱該項部隊已進抵考那斯東南某地，距東普魯士邊境三十五哩。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　海通社訊：柯維爾區仍有劇戰，蘇軍屢次由側面進攻，終未獲逞，敵軍欲向西南擴張其攻勢，結果損失極重。</p>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德軍當局十三日接見記者團時，會否認德軍縮短波羅的海三國展綫之傳說，幷表明波羅的海之德軍襲於戰局演變，爲改善波羅的海各國防衛之位置，僅後退無幾。波羅的海各國爲歐洲國內之一部，德軍決維持東綫北部及南部各地之防備勢力。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹各國之動向具決定戰局重要性</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　巴爾幹各國會爲第一次世界大戰之導火綫，在此次大展中亦頗具決定戰局至重要性，尤其反軸心軍在北法登陸以來，其予已爾幹各國之影嚮如何，已成全世界關懷中心。茲介紹此間同盟週報巴爾幹最近之政治情形如次：已爾幹與德國之關係，恰如東方日本與大東亞國之情形相似，乃德國完成戰爭之不可或缺之後方兵站基地，因之各國之政情動尚，關係德軍戰力者當不爲尠。</p>
<p>反軸心國政治攻勢</p>
<p>茲尤慨述德黑　會議後半年來各國之動向，以爲他日之推斷。東綫之發展與義大利之事態，對巴爾幹各國均有深刻影嚮，乃不可否認者。其最值注意者，尚有德黑關會談後反軸心各國對巴爾幹之政治攻勢，其中以東綫之成功爲後盾之蘇聯政治壓力，及以策動侵歐戰綫爲威嚇手段之英美謀略，由其结果觀之，已屬失敗，且反促使德國與巴爾幹之關係更加緊密，然其影響至今尙未根絕，此可以斷言者也。茲將巴爾幹各國情形逐一分述於次：</p>
<p>德羅提携協力防共</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞自三月中旬以來，蘇軍先鋒已在羅聞境內布陣，其另一部自喀爾巴阡山脈北部廷迥，頗有由泰諾波爾及連比爾格之綫，向洪牙利之斯慮阿卡推進。羅馬尼亞直至一九四〇年夏，仍帶有十足之英法色彩，今日已逢生死存亡之重大關頭，英美有鑒於此，乃伸其政洽謀略之魔手，同時並反復對布加勒斯特·布羅多斯基等地加以無區別之轟炸。羅馬尼亞以首相安托納斯古强力之統率，力與德國軍事政治相給合，遂形成巴爾幹中最安謐之國家，加之羅國人民恐怖蘇聯勢力之逼近，其防共態勞益見加强，更因英美空軍盲目轟炸，反引起羅國人民之反感。現在德羅聯軍協力在雅賽附近參加作戰，但一般國民中亦不能謂絕無因反軸心軍事政治之謀略而發生動搖者。</p>
<p>保衛油田既定方針</p>
<p>四月二日莫洛托夫發表之盤明，及蘇軍渡過普魯特河突進羅境，又惹起重大反嚮，更因蘇聯興捷克流亡政權於四月三十日締結協定，及蘇軍自喀爾巴阡山脈展開迂迥作戰，可知蘇軍顯然又將進攻捷克，如此勢必掀起羅馬尼亞之注意。五月一日斯達林布告進攻羅國，實頗堪注目，此種情勢姑不論其心理上予羅馬尼亞何種打擊，而在形勢上羅馬尼亞之抗戰意識，反益趨旺盛。英美空軍盲炸布加勒斯特，該市雖蒙甚大損失，但油田地帶之被書極爲輕微，德政府四月上旬發表聲明，謂無論犧牲如何，必定保術羅馬尼亞，絕無撤退之意，此不獨在保護該國油田，即爲確保巴爾幹全體之安定，亦屬必然之方針，因之德軍雖在東綫通續撤退，但普魯特河一帶，始終尚未有何移動。</p>
<p>洪反動派餘孽肅淸</p>
<p>蘇軍於三月十七日進駐員薩拉比亞後，十九日德軍亦行進駐洪牙利飛機塲交通要點，重耍工塲亦完全委由德軍守備，二十日德元首會見洪牙利攝政霍爾第，結果於二十二日遂斷行內閣之改組。綠洪牙利興義大利相友善，去夏義大利投降後，洪牙利頗有動搖之勢，此次斯特亞軍組閣後，一掃動搖分子，與德緊密協力，並以强硬手段取締猶太人，解散與猶太人有關之政黨，查封報館，此舉亦可謂一種社愈革命矣。德方撤換體亞果公使，派維森麥亞爲德國全權代表，賦與特別權限，與洪牙利政府完全成緊密協力態勢，然目下尙未全部終了。</p>
<p>英國謀略極堪注目</p>
<p>三月下旬倫敦成立流亡政權洪牙利委員會，將在洪國內開始活動，該會委員長於第一次大戰後之一九一八年革命時，就任洪牙利共和國大總統，一九二〇年以後在外國渡其亡命生活，此亦爲英國政治謀略之一環，甚值注目。斯特亞內閣之決戰體制，議展極爲順利，除實行國軍再編，進行動員十七歲以上之男子外，五月中旬派柏布里克與德研討對德協力間題，洪牙利實爲德國之有力盟邦，其後方軍需基地所予德國之協力頗爲可觀，其航空機械二業所予德國之援助尤足稱道。</p>
<h3>西班牙海軍　最高會議</h3>
<p>總德里十四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據訂靠方面消息：在海軍部長摩萊諾主持下所舉行之西班牙艦隊最高會議，經數日之討論後，己於十三日閉幕，參加會議之各元帥與將校，已於同日各返原任。</p>
<h3>北法戰事與土耳其</h3>
<p>於北法所展開的侵歐作戰，似乎對於歐洲東角的土耳其，給與莫大影響。在大戰五年期間，土耳其一面爲英國的盟邦，一面爲德國的友邦，一面抵抗着英國要求參戰的重壓，一面應付美德國外交界審宿的巴本大使，而終於走到非交戰國的危險橋樑上。伊斯美大總統不管第二戰綫如何發展，而只是堅持英不參戰不加入的宗旨，這是根據各方面的觀察，訂以明瞭的，但該犬總統的方針，是否真能繼經，誠屬一大問題。</p>
<p>兩種壓力</p>
<p>第二戰錢開闢後的土耳其軍政狀態，如按十五日回布達佩斯的某軍事專家談，土耳其政界的一部對於第二戰綫的判斷，認爲現在這樣的北法作戰，已經是英美破釜沉舟竭盡全力的大陸攻防主力戰，即正式的第二戰綫，而歐洲戰局的最後歸宿，即在此一舉。在這種內部耍素之外，還不要忽視，壓迫土耳其參戰的許多外部要素，在活躍着。第一，即英美的重壓加强。最近因德國船舶通過達達納爾海峽，而英美乘機對士壓迫，藉口德國船舶載運軍火，而嚴重向土提出如最後通諜式的抗義，要求立刻與德斷絕通商關係。土耳其固曾竭力拖延回答，以避危機，但問題則決定於英美將繼續壓迫到什麽程度，土耳其將堅持到什麽程度，德國實力對巴爾幹的彩響如何之者。</p>
<p>第二個要素，就是土耳其對保加利亞政局的判斷。道就是說，土耳其根據最近保加利亞總參謀長魯克西的逮捕事件，相繼而生的政變和新內閣八選，認爲保加利亞的政局，尚有伸縮的餘地。與此相關聯的第三點，就是蘇聯一方面對羅馬尼亞南部，業已準備好夏季攻勢的力量，另一方面，子克里米亞半島方面，對於保加里亞海岸登陸作戰的準備，業已就緒。所以在土耳其方面看來，蘇聯從羅馬尼亞南部企圖向靠近達達納爾海峽的保加利亞進軍，業已成爲現實了。</p>
<p>參戰有待</p>
<p>假如蘇聯對保加利亞作戰一旦實現。然而這從土耳其的觀點看來，土耳其生命綫的達達納爾海峽，業已受到蘇聯從歐洲方面來的威脅，所以土耳其無論如何，不能不準備防衛。於是或許投到坐鎮巴爾幹的德國方面，假如認爲這樣前途是不可靠的，則追隨英美立刻發戰，尚巴爾乾進軍，於是土耳其問題應運而生。同時，根據目前的情報，土耳其軍部中的確　含着開闢另一第二戰棧的危險性。</p>
<p>但土耳其的參戰，是否真能實現，這耍看上述各種要素微妙錯綜的結果，現在是不能妄加豫測的。但所恃以下芷確判斷者，第一是看德國抵抗蘇聯向巴爾幹進攻的能力如何，第二是看德國能否撲滅西歐的英美第二戰錢，第三是看德國應付土耳其軍部所推測的第二戰綫結果，英美對巴爾幹的野心。總而言之，是要看德國的武裝力量如何。听以只要德國在巴爾幹有不可動搖的堅强銅墻鋼壁如大西洋圍墻，則今日土耳其政焚的變化，是可以隨着德國的旗開得勝，而不至於具體化，同時，籠罩土耳其的參戰空氣，即可禦消霧散，否則就不堪設想了。（魯譯自六月二十八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>防空當局修正　交通印象管制　車輛警音器應使用短聲</h3>
<p>上海防空當局目前業將警報期間之交通及音響制加以强化，其中關於交通統制，即警戒警報發出後五分鐘，一般車輛及步行者均須一律停止通行，業經數次防空訓練實地施行，一般市民均已漸見慣習。惟關於音聲管制方面迄今尚未明確規定，尤當車　之驚音器　　　雜之際，路上行人之聽覺常受障碍，　　報　出時，路上之秧底有因之釀起混亂之處。本市陸海軍防空司令部當局有鑒於此，特於昨（十四）日發佈第二十五號告示，將第二十四號告示所規定之交通　　統制規程，加以修正，即此後當　報發出後，凡汽車及其他　　　音器之音量，均以　合西倍里以下，七十台西倍里以上爲限，旦長時間之　覺有被誤認發報之成，故同時規定應使用短聲，茲分錄當局告示及談話於次：</p>

<p>防空司令部當局談話</p>
<p>告示第二十五號乃係將向來處於放任狀態之軍輛警音器根據防空上必要加以統制。</p>
<p>第一規定警音器之音量爲百台西倍里以下七十合四倍里以上。查百台西倍爲車輛運所上最大必要限度，若徐行緩駛，　織使少至六十五台西倍里，亦可不致惹起交通事故，管制裝置極爲簡單，僅須在警音器塞以布類或以布片遮蔽聲音器口部即可。</p>
<p>凡未能暸解標準響程度者，應以檢查合格之車輛或防空司令部所備之樣品爲參考，從速完成管制裝置。</p>
<p>第二告示第二十四號規定警報期間，除必不得考外，槪不得及用警音器，然不得巳必須使用之際，應發短聲，不可使用長聲，以免妨害防空聽音</p>
<p>本告示在警報期間中，固屬有效，即非在警報期間中，亦須同樣施行，故一切車主應充分暸解本告示之旨趣，以發揮看響管制實效爲要。</p>

<h3>防疫當局　實施強迫注射　定二星期內辦理完竣</h3>

<p>霍亂處置方針</p>
<p>本市防疫工作，經本市衛生當局，積極推進霍亂預防注射，已人强迫注射時期，務使市民均受注射，而過止疫癘發生。昨經衛生當周發表霍亂處置方針探錄如下：</p>
<p>查霍亂預防注射，原係抑止疫癘之發生，然本市一般勞工階級，術生常職幼稚，而對政府所施防疫措施，未能根本瞭解，預防注射，每多觀避。是以本年度將來霍亂之發生，事實上或恐難免，本市衛生當局，爲未雨綢繆計，對於霍亂發生後之處置問題，早已準備就緒，在霍亂發生後之處置辦法，第一患者之隔離收容及治療，在兩租界未收回以前，每多隔開，現在市正統一，一切事宜，自當統籌辦理，</p>
<p>隔離醫院</p>
<p>按之前年本市霍亂猖獗情形，患者達二九八六人，而民國二十七年，本市霍亂患者，約有七千餘人，而患者之危險時期，大約三日以內，自發生時至出院日期，約十日乃至十四日，則本市如有固定床位八百架，即數應用。就目前本市隔離醫院，第一區北海路隔離醫院，計一百架，　八區內隔離醫院，病床二〇〇架，地方醫院一百架，南市隔離醫院一百架，滬北傳染病醫院一百架，上海時疫醫院約二百架，大西路急救時疫醫院六十架，滬西方面衛生局，已在就市立滬西醫院改組爲隅離醫院，預計設置病床一百架，加以本市熱心人士，歷屆均有臨時時疫醫院之設立，預料本年度本市對於霍亂病人之收容問題，不難解決。至於鄉區方面，如高橋，川沙，周浦，閔行，寶山等處，本市市立診　機關，循例設置臨時隔離病室，惜以鄉民無知，凡遇霍亂發生，不知自行投院治療，而以生命雜　於針瘡等之江湖醫士，今後尚希各特別原公署當局遇有疑似霍亂者，應即會同於於機關，按照處理法定傳染病法規辦理，採便送至本市化騐機關鑑定，並應竭力提倡設立臨時時疫醫院，以防萬一</p>
<p>至於治療方面，按照歷年洽療統計，病重者約佔百分之二十乃至百分之二十五，此種重病患者，均須用葡萄糖及其他强心劑治療，其餘均須用生理食藥水，此種藥劑，本市衛生行政當局，均已充分準備，不　缺乏。</p>
<p>細菌檢</p>
<p>其二爲細菌檢查，凡市民不幸而患霍亂，其第一次檢查，由各衛生分處或衛生事務所，派員採取，患者及其同居或隣居之大便，送由第一區衛生處病理化騐室化騐，嗣後當由該患者所在之隔離醫院，負責採取，送至化騐室檢查。惟查歷年宜隔離病院，對於患者未能予以嚴格檢查，致使患者有復發之虞。本屆對於細菌檢查，應由衛生處嚴格執行，必須檢騐確定陰性，始准出院，以策安全。共三爲封鎖疫區問題，霍亂疫病發生時，行政當局自當按照處理傳染病法規予以封鎖，以防蔓廷。事變後關於防疫，棄由明邦辦理，前以南市等處霍亂發生，即由即邦當局予以封鎖後，實施檢查，現在盟邦當局爲尊重吾國主權之完整，關於疫政事宜，已交還吾國主持，斷絕交通，搜查疫區一節，已由本市防疫委員會與警察局及保甲取得密切聯絡，嚴格執行。其他如消毒工作，衛生當局已倔有消毒隊十餘隊，過有霍亂發生，即當隨時出動工作。</p>
<p>至於霍亂患者，不幸而致死亡，本市巳通知殯儀館不得擅自收殮霍亂患者屍體，並須按照傳染病造法處理，以火葬爲原則，第以市民風俗關係，一時難以推行，惟如係士葬，須不靠近水源，掘土七尺，棺木內外埋藏多量石灰，以免藉水源傳播。</p>
<h3>塞班島作戰　美軍得不償失　松島部長發表談話</h3>
<p>日在滬艦隊報道部長松島大佐，昨（十四日）下午二時循例在海軍武官府會見中國記者團，答復幷報告最近時局問題。茲將部長申述各點，扼要摘　於后：</p>
<p>敵在塞班傷亡慘重　　關於塞班島最近情况，松島部長答復記者垂詢謂：美方發表云，本月九日，美國已全部佔領塞班，此爲極大錯誤，截止目前，塞班北部，仍有大部日軍集結，繼續對敵反攻，敵之損害，仍在遂漸據大之中。關於美軍損傷，美方發表，自六月十一日至三十日，損傷九七五二人，內有戰死一二八九人。七月十二日美海軍長官佛萊司特賡　發表自七月一日至十二日，美軍損傷一五〇五三人，內有戰死二三六七人，吾人姑以此數爲根據，不難想像敵力人力死亡慘重。此次塞班作戰，主要之航空戰係在六月份，自七月起即屬陸上戰門，覲乎美方之死亡狀况，可推知日軍作戰之英勇，敵軍之損傷，隨時間進展而增加。敵此項數字僅指陸戰而言，益以敝方艦艇五十艘以上之捐失，航空人員及飛機之損害，其群細數宇，必堪驚人。猶　美無軍尼米賢上將實謂：至六月杪，美國海軍損傷必較在所羅門島之瓜達爾卡納　　　出兩倍，但揆褚目前美方所發表之數字，已達四倍，實出尼米黃氏意料之外，若再加上航空及艦艇之捐失，則其數已超出十倍矣。</p>
<p>內綫作戰日軍有利</p>
<p>塞班附近，尙有若干島嶼爲日靈佔領，美軍縱獲得塞班島，但仍不能以之爲補給基地或船舶泊椗地，仍須以黑紹爾或夏威夷爲生要基地，除上述兩地外，馬紹爾以西幾無地可供美海軍利用。至於塞班方面，因而積關係，不能容納大型航空機，同時該地海洋氣候，飛　亦不能自由飛行，美因現正對塞班作大量宜傳，描繪其地之重要，果真如美國所述，日軍過去不必在夏威夷及菲律賓作設，僅持塞班足矣。塞班撤退，吾人固不無稍覺遺憾，但對誘敵深入，出血作戰之戰略，吾人已獲得成功，此點並可刺激日本生產部門，增加產量，反而足以獲幸。但塞班附近，數艦艇僅有小數活動，陸上戰門，日軍正在作最後之英勇霽戰，此後之內綫作戰，於日方更爲有利。簡略言之，有四：A，敵輕出血後，戰力漸减，B日軍補給路縮短，C日主力易於集中職敵，D敵損害無法修補與逃避。晉人具備此項內綫作戰優點，對塞班之得失，實不必多予重視也。</p>
<p>緬甸代表感慨之言</p>
<p>緬甸代表巴亭氏在滬音謂滿現在緬甸全國人民，均在槍林砲雨之中爲大東亞戰爭而努力，及至日本，目覩日本軍民生活嚴肅，理興苦幹，上下一心，共求大東亞戰爭勝利，其精神深足欽佩。但在上海所見，迴然不同，幾無法尋出戰爭形跡，中國靑年男女，生活享受舒適，携手徜徉街市者觸目皆是，彼等似亳不注意中國之前途命運，興東亞之前途命運，甚爲不解其故。吾人對巴亭氏所言，亦具同感，目前上海有一部份人對於戰局似毫不關心，認爲與已無關，此種觀念，實極大鎭誤。退一萬步言，假使日軍撤離上海，英美軍重登滬地，被等所受之生活上待遇，是否能如目前日軍在滬者一樣，誠屬極値得思慮之問題。晉人率直言之，英美人之優待中國人，其原因是有一日本在，一旦日本離開中國，英美絕不會再予中國僵待。諸君當不致忘去「華人與犬不得入丙」之公　捐載，余竭誠奉　此輩，不計及國家前途命運而祗　目前享樂者，在享樂之餘，細味英美軍重來中國所受之後果。</p>
<p>中日命運同苦共甘</p>
<p>吾爲日軍之靑年將校，在職責上貫，固廳喚起中日兩國靑年人士共同負起大東亞戰爭所賦之使命，就余個人信念而言，亦唯有中目兩國之靑年眞誠合作，才能負起未來的重實。過去兩國國事，有遺憾者固有，但此爲兩國前輩所爲，吾人不必在此時來檢討，此後之事。責在吾輩靑年，觀乎目前中國一部份靑年尤其在上海靑年情况，實堪爲中國前途命運担憂。吾再坦白言之，中國之命運與日本軍之命運相同，美尼米資計劃三條進攻日本路綫，以中國綫最爲可能，此時日軍正在前方浴血苦戰，希望此一般中國靑年不要以「觀　馬」的態度來旁觀，要切實反省，實行同苦共甘來負起未來的大使命。</p>

<h3>請速決定棉織業命運</h3>
<p>— 胡其昌</p>
<p>去年八月十日當局因棉紗布價格日形高漲，囤戶及投機家或以紗布爲投機目標而加以操縱，對於民生影響殊爲巨大，於是頒佈命令將上海存儲之紗布，不論所持有者爲廠商抑國戶，全面加以收買，所定價格懂及市值二分之一或三分之一，且半以黃金半以定期存單付給之</p>
<p>自戰與以來，棉織業以製品供不數來，故盡將流通資金添置生產機器與原料，擴充生產供給需用者，至是所受打擊雖巨，然以當局原意爲打學投機操縱老而使民生安定，對正當合法之廠商，必有妥善處理之辦法，故皆坦然以待。更因此後不法之囤戶巳無法活動，棉織廠業昔日所遵「操縱壟斷」之經謂不分之不白之冤，已可大白於天下，亦可慶之事也。而當局體諒廠問，得保留一個月之原料，以供廠間使用，使生產得繼續進行不輟。</p>
<p>迨乎今年年初，常局標榜肅正思想，增加生產，復定本年爲增產年，行政官員不時發表增產之高見，與論又復日以增產爲言，棉織廠業自收買後至年終，時已四月，進款亳無，廠中員工勉力維持，保留之原料亦盡製成，原冀當局經斯時日，收賈工作已可告一段落，配給原料及蒐買製品之方法行將公布，正棉織廠業苦盡甘來之日也。</p>
<p>執思增產也者，徒言無實，時至今日，民國三十三年已逝其半，配給原料云云，「只見樓梯響，不見人下來」。更屬遙遙無期，廠商雖有憲增產，以供人民需求，使猖獗之黑市無從產生，其奈巧婦難爲無米之炊，徒然心餘</p>
<p>月來雖國聞已有生產給原料與各布廠，但粥少僧各，以滬上布廠之衆，僅配給數千件棉紗，實屬無濟於事，三數日後，各廠又將停産。以今日高物價之巨額開支，以俟此未知何時到廠之原料之生產，每疋製造費用勢將數倍於原料。而此後是否再有原料配給，尚屬疑問。即屬有之，則數額是否足用？何年何月始能抵廠？已有前鑑，任何人亦難言之。以有限之資本，易逝之歲月，而俟此不知何年何月之配給，誠如所謂「俟河之淸，人壽幾何？」不如早日關門爲愈了。</p>
<p>今次商統會改組，由聞開亨氏爲理事長，而棉業管理處又以聞先生業主委。聞先生出身棉業，對於棉織各業所受困苦當所　　，自能一掃前商統會一年以來，不知所云之因循拖延之官僚派惡習。切盼聞先生能鑒於前商統會之股鑑，對於此後是否仍初收買？配給是否經常而且足額？抑或易轍另籌妥善之增產方法？即日擬訂切實方案，呈請當局核審後，尅日明令公布，俾棉織廠榮得知當局是否確欲增產而定關門與否，而從警人員亦得知所去從了。</p>
<h3>預防上川鐵路肇禍向公用局提出建議</h3>
<p>— 程漢明</p>
<p>因見本月一日報載：「浦東慶寗寺傾覆渡浦小舟溺斃工人十數人」新聞一則；而使我連想到由慶寗寺爲起點，日載數千人，往來於上海與川沙兩匯間之上川輕便鐵道之交通安全矣。</p>
<p>查該路現由市府公用局管理，想係戰時物資缺乏，復以營業所入不足抵所出之故，車輛道路一任其與歲月而損，加之車行次數，因煤斤不足而减至日行社復四次，乘客無異數倍而增之，其擁擠之狀，不亞於上下寫字間時間之電車，較重愈大而車輛道路之損毀率亦愈大，是故路基之石子幾與土地等高，路軌之枕木盡爲毀蝕。年來列車出軌之事，週必數起，所幸每次出軌均未肇致命之禍，乘客習以爲常，該路當局亦以頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚之法，就所出事之處，稍加修理而已。是故車行擺蕩震撼，一是嬰孩所睡之搖籃，設叹不幸出軌於橋樑或臨近橋樑之處，則其所成慘劇恐十百倍於慶寗寺之覆舟慘劇乎！即或幸而茍延殘喘，則一年半載之後彼車恐不復行矣，無論爲預防肇成鉅禍計，爲以後浦東交通計，均勿客坐視該路日損月毀，一至不能行駛而後已。市公用局責職所在，　請迅謀對策，庶可挽浩刦於一旦，維交通於將來也，敬將難材料籌資金鄙見數端，略陳於後，俾資參考：</p>
<p>枕本爲該路損毀最多者，且爲當前最急迫者，而需欵最鉅者也，際此木材奇缺而交通困難之時，如向他地採購，殊非易事，如以合理市價就地微購民間所植樹木，非但節省時間，抑且節省成本。</p>
<p>籌欵辦法：甲，發行公債，按上南川三縣之地賦營藥稅攤派之。乙，就現在所售車票附加徵之。丙，由浦東同鄉會公開黴募。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>櫻與　（八）</p>
<p>「吳鎮是和東京不同的，是沒有好飯館的。所謂飯館，全都是大衆食堂。」</p>
<p>眞人這樣說着，走向火車站不遠的大罵路，而領到福田旅館兼飯店裏去。隆夫看着房十的構造，很像東京著名的娼妓館，所以覺着有點怕人，但眞人的面孔，也似乎表示着不大慣的樣子。據說這是海軍士官舉行宴會最多的所在，但眞人似乎無緣，因爲心中想把監夫帶到最好的所在來，才選定了這個地方。</p>
<p>「疲倦了吧！不洗澡麼？」</p>
<p>走過像客　似的屋子時，眞人就這樣說。「不，洗澡雖然要緊，但談話更要緊。」「呵，那末，或許早一點，但可否把飯革來？」</p>
<p>真人命令女用人這樣說。</p>
<p>「領到這樣漂亮的地方來，真有點感激你。」</p>
<p>隆夫把日本式的跪着坐法，變爲盤腿大坐，這樣說了。</p>
<p>「因爲是替你慶祝呵！今天眞妙！談到海軍大臣賞，甚至對我都增光不少。你爸爸也一定高興的。」</p>
<p>眞人非常高興地這樣說着。</p>
<p>「好說，好說。因此我想乘此機會回家一饞。」</p>
<p>「呵，原來如此呵！正是合乎衣錦歸鄉的意思。」</p>
<p>「這還談不到呵！是打算回家謝私奔之罪的。」</p>
<p>「是的，讓雙親担心，這是不行的。我也想在今年秋父回家看看母親去。」</p>
<p>真人說出這樣話來，這是對於思親的自然流　。</p>
<p>女僕托來酒肴。的確是上等的菜。</p>
<p>「近來我不飲酒了。你怎樣？」</p>
<p>真人用手遮着着杯這樣說。</p>
<p>「怎麼了？</p>
<p>「不，不行……」</p>
<p>真人雖沒有淸楚的說出理由來，但隆夫深感覺　真人的嚴正態度，也就不勸他喝酒了。</p>
<p>「面到老家去，一定會有很多吃驚的事吧！——枝小姐也一定長大成人了。」</p>
<p>眞人還是用親切的語氣，道樣微笑着着說。他當五十鈴號軍艦在鹿兒島八港時，曾經看到過產夫的父親和枝小姐，但隆夫自巴却正正六年未見家裹的人了。</p>
<p>「多半是吧！她已經二十歲了。」</p>
<p>隆夫感慨　之地甩嘴唇呷着酒杯，突然又說</p>
<p>「呵，想起來了。給眞人看畫的照片這件事，幾乎忘記了。」（一一七）</p>

<h3>Further Contribution to the General Commerce Control Association</h3>
<p>The National Association of Commerce Notifications held its second board of directors meeting the day before yesterday and finalized internal organizational restructuring. The future work should be developed with a new spirit to fulfill the state's mission and the people's expectations of control. We have made two suggestions to the General Commerce Control Association. The editorial on June 16th proposed four hopes, expecting the General Commerce Control Association to improve itself. The editorial on July 8th listed the necessary conditions for the effectiveness of economic control and proposed three points for the joint efforts of the General Commerce Control Association and its affiliated institutions. Now, based on our observations, we will discuss the following:</p>
<p>At present, the function of the General Commerce Control Association has been stipulated that it will not handle actual control work, but is responsible for comprehensive liaison, review, and supervision of its five committees. In essence, the General Commerce Control Association should inquire about the trends of the actual control work of the five committees. In other words, the General Commerce Control Association should be jointly responsible for the effectiveness of the actual work of the five committees. Therefore, the General Commerce Control Association is by no means just an empty-shell agency for forwarding documents. If the General Commerce Control Association is merely a formal forwarding agency, it is a fundamentally redundant agency, so why have this burden?</p>
<p>Since the General Commerce Control Association is not an empty-shell forwarding agency, we hope it has "genuine" power and ability, and then be assigned the responsibilities it should bear. We believe that:</p>
<p>First, the General Commerce Control Association and its five committees must maintain frequent and close contact, and cooperate under a unified control principle. As we have said, the five committees should have consistent steps in terms of organization, personnel, and facilities, and there should be no phenomenon of deviating from the General Commerce Control Association and acting independently. Now we further suggest that a similar "Control Work Liaison Conference" be set up within the General Commerce Control Association, organized by senior cadres appointed by the General Commerce Control Association and the five committees, to regularly discuss the liaison matters of implementation work. The board of directors meeting of the General Commerce Control Association is to decide on major policies and principles. This conference is specifically for discussing liaison work so that there is absolutely no phenomenon of separation and independent action between each other.</p>
<p>Second, the documents of the five committees to the Executive Yuan and other superior agencies should be forwarded by the General Commerce Control Association. At the same time, the important measures of the five committees themselves should also be agreed upon by the General Commerce Control Association first, which is the scope that should be in the organization and authority. If the important measures of a certain committee can be directly reported to the Executive Yuan for decision without going through the General Commerce Control Association, then it is very likely that the General Commerce Control Association will still be unaware when this measure is implemented, which is not a joke. There is no need to cite past examples. Recently, it was rumored that the Flour and Wheat Committee had no contact with the new chairman of the General Commerce Control Association after taking office, as if they were opposing agencies that were not related to each other. This is unreasonable in terms of organizational system and public perception, and the government and the General Commerce Control Association authorities should immediately correct it. At the same time, we want to ask, what is the basis for the Flour and Wheat Control Committee to do this?</p>
<p>Third, our ally Japan has entrusted Chinese personnel to handle China's economic control with a spirit of autonomy, and administratively, it is hoped that China will independently assume absolute responsibility for handling it. On the one hand, the General Commerce Control Association and the five committees cannot ignore the opinions of the Allied authorities, and close liaison and full cooperation should be obtained in advance on control policies and important measures. However, in the attitude of Chinese people handling affairs, they should not only say yes or no, and follow orders, but also cannot ignore them, but should sincerely and frankly discuss with each other, and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War as the principle, and under this principle, the two countries should cooperate fully.</p>
<p>Finally, what we never forget is the principle of using people according to their talents. The past failure experience lies in the unsound personnel. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the General Commerce Control Association should set up a personnel committee to be responsible for the selection and assessment. Especially for new employees, if they do not meet the standards, they should never be forced to be hired. Secondly, economic control is a new undertaking in our country, and new scientific methods must be adopted to adapt to the environment at any time. Although control work emphasizes implementation, there should be a perfect plan as a basis before implementation.</p>

<p>Talks Between Minister Chu and Chargé d'affaires Spinelli</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following statement regarding the signing of the agreement on the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, and the right to station troops:</p>
<p>"On January 11 last year, the Italian government resolutely followed the Japanese government in voluntarily announcing the abandonment of the administrative power of the Concession in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Subsequently, on March 29, the agreement between China and Italy on the handover of the administrative power of the Legation Quarter in Peiping was signed. The handover was implemented on March 30, and the clauses on the implementation of the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession were signed on July 23, and the handover was implemented on August 1. However, the Italian Concession in Tianjin had not yet been handed over due to the time required for preparation, so the only Concession in China that had not been recovered was this one.</p>
<p>Now that the government of the Italian Social Republic has been established under the leadership of President Mussolini, and our country has long recognized it, normal diplomatic relations have been restored. Therefore, in February of this year, I sent a telegram to Ambassador Cai in Japan to discuss the supplementary recognition of the handover procedures with Chargé d'affaires Biringucci of Italy in Japan. At that time, the Chargé d'affaires was also ordered by the Italian government to be responsible for negotiating with our country. After several consultations by Ambassador Cai, the opinions were very close. Taking advantage of the opportunity for me to go to Japan to await the Chairman's recovery from illness, I personally consulted with the newly appointed Chargé d'affaires Spinelli of Italy in China and the Chargé d'affaires in Japan, and submitted the draft agreement to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval. It is now scheduled for July 14, when I and the Chargé d'affaires will represent the Chinese and Italian governments to formally sign the agreement between the Republic of China and Italy on the handover of the Tianjin Concession, the abolition of extraterritoriality in China, and the right to station troops.</p>
<p>The establishment of concessions in China has a history of nearly a hundred years. The initiator was actually Britain. Fortunately, our ally Japan took the lead in proposing the return of the Concession, and France also voluntarily followed up and implemented it. Now that Italy has signed the agreement and implemented the handover from the date of signing, the word Concession will be eliminated and become a historical term. The abnormal system of the past hundred years will also be completely eliminated. From now on, our country's territory will remain intact, and our country's sovereignty will remain independent. Therefore, the signing of the Sino-Italian agreement today will help our country's recovery, which is no small matter.</p>
<p>At a time of intense war, the Italian government has resolutely implemented the abandonment of the rights and interests it has enjoyed in our country for more than 70 years. Its spirit of international morality is not only the most brilliant and bright page in the history of Sino-Italian relations, but also something that the government and people of the country will always be grateful for.</p>
<p>After our government recovers the Concession, we will strive to improve the management and operation so that the Italian people living in the area can continue to live and work in peace and increase their well-being, so as to repay the kindness of the Italian government."</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - Chargé d'affaires Spinelli said: The government of the Italian Social Republic has always had a deep understanding and sincere friendship with the Republic of China. Since the establishment of the National Government under the leadership of Chairman Wang, President Mussolini has repeatedly expressed his extreme assistance and admiration for the emerging China that is booming in construction. Therefore, the government of the Italian Social Republic has given priority to proposing to the allied country the return of the Italian Concession in Tianjin, the renunciation of extraterritoriality, and the abolition of the right to station troops in China. After signing the agreement today, the Fascist Italian Republic will abandon all privileges in China. This move will open a new era in the relations between China and Italy. I firmly believe that this close cooperation will further inspire the heroic nations of our allies to fight for true freedom and justice in the world and will surely achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>Mizuno Arrives in Bangkok</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 14th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Itaro Mizuno, Director of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Greater East Asia, arrived in Bangkok by plane on the morning of the 14th while inspecting the South.</p>
<h3>Review of Grain Issues in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Administrative Purchase is Right or Wrong</p>
<p>The grain purchase presided over by the Rice Control Association is based on the so-called contribution system. That is, from the provincial government to the county government, from the county government to the district offices, and from the district offices to the villages, the quantity to be responsible for supplying to the rice merchants designated by the Rice Control Association is specified. The general so-called administrative purchase does not refer to the administrative organs themselves implementing the purchase, but refers to the purchase implemented by various merchants who fully utilize administrative power. Regarding the right and wrong of this administrative purchase, the issue of whether to continue or abolish it, various opinions have been expressed in Shanghai. For example, cotton will never be purchased administratively, and it has been decided to entrust farmers to handle it, and other major agricultural products will also take the same approach. Regarding grain, after the abolition of movement restrictions and the implementation of temporary measures, many people have strongly advocated or anticipated that administrative purchases will be completely abolished. Free purchase or administrative purchase is a fundamental issue that determines the success of the harvest, and it is not something that can be easily discussed. As a result of the reporter's visits to the inland areas, he is even more convinced that the administrative purchase method, even if it needs comprehensive improvement, does not need to be abolished and a fixed quota system established. This is an opinion that is opposed to the general argument for free purchase of grain. The particularity of the grain issue and the reality of grain purchase in the inland areas make the reporter more insistent on this opinion. Advocates of free purchase only focus on the negative aspects of administrative purchase and ignore the confusion and drawbacks that the free purchase method will inevitably lead to. In this regard, we oppose using new defects to fill old defects, and want to open the way to purchase grain in the future through efforts to reform the current system. As mentioned earlier, in promoting grain purchase, the three-in-one cooperation of military, political, and economic power is absolutely necessary. That is not a problem in nature that can be improved by purely economic behavior of liberalism. In the abstract theory that does not fit the current situation, and in the invisible correction of economic and technical aspects, the method of purchasing that discovers concrete countermeasures for fundamentally reforming political power is, from the most realistic and concrete point of view, actually the most conceptual and abstract method. We painfully feel that the way to fundamentally reform the method that has been implemented for several years is the method that is most adapted to the security, political, and economic reality of rural areas in the interior.</p>
<p>Amend Purchase Method</p>
<p>The contribution system does have many drawbacks that should be reformed. In particular, the Rice Control Association's incomplete purchase policy is even more harmful. However, the effort to amend it is not a simple theoretical issue now. From March to April, many valuable lessons were learned from practical experience in various places. For example, boldly adopting the direct cash-on-the-spot exchange system between designated purchasing merchants and farmers has had an impact on the general farmers beyond expectations. These experiences should not be buried by the abstract theory of free purchase that makes the most of its advantages in the future. The reporter listened extensively to the opinions and experiences of all parties on this issue in Songjiang, Kunshan, Suzhou, and Wuxi, and now summarizes the main points for reference. First, abolish the fixed price system that will never change for a year and adopt a regional, temporal, and mobile high-price system.</p>
<p>The method of purchasing grain at a price that is one-half or one-third of the market price can no longer be adopted. When the Rice Control Association was first established, it did not intend to adopt this policy, but wanted to purchase at the market price at that time. We have repeatedly pointed out that when the Rice Control Association announced the purchase price, it was much higher than the market price in the major distribution centers. However, the purchase was not implemented during this period, and smugglers and hoarders competed to implement the purchase and move it out at a value slightly higher than the Rice Control Association's price; when the Rice Control Association began to implement the overall purchase, the price difference was already very large. This situation cannot be repeated in the future. If the inland price has now reached 〇〇 yuan, it will obviously produce more profound results than last year if a lower cheap price is used for purchase. A highly mobile high-price policy should be used to implement rapid and decisive purchases from the time of harvest to the end of the lunar New Year.</p>
<p>The issue of the purchase budget tending to be huge due to the high-price policy is not a problem that can be solved in the direct purchase aspect. It should be solved from another perspective in the National Government's financial policy. (Translated from the Mainland News on June 24)</p>

<h3>Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Results of the Attack on Guilin Airdrome: 89 American and Chongqing Planes Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 pm on the 14th: The Japanese Air Force in China is continuing to reduce the strength of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. On the morning of the 13th, it launched a surprise attack on Guilin, attacking the powerful US Air Force assembled at the airdrome, causing it to collapse and reduce its strength, and then returned safely to its base. The results of the battle were as follows: 13 enemy large aircraft and 41 small aircraft were destroyed, 10 enemy large aircraft and 25 small aircraft were damaged, for a total of 89 aircraft. Eight aviation facilities on the ground were bombed and set on fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese aircraft attacked the Guilin airdrome again on the morning of the 13th, causing 89 Chongqing-US aircraft to catch fire and burn, and destroying eight of its military facilities. This is a rare result in the operation. Recently, in order to reverse the decline, they have built air force bases in Zhijiang, Guilin, Danzhu, and other places on both sides of the Yuehan Line, attempting to defend to the death. After the successive fall of the airfields in Changsha, Xiangtan, and Hengyang, the Chongqing-US Air Force, in order to reverse the decline, had concentrated the air force of the bases in the southwestern region in Guilin by the 12th. However, it was detected by the Japanese side early, so on the morning of the 13th, the Japanese aircraft sent a preemptive strike and launched an offensive, and the surprise attack on Guilin resulted in almost all 89 Chongqing aircraft being bombed and destroyed, and eight military facilities were also completely destroyed, and the Japanese aircraft were not damaged. From July 1 to the present, the number of Chongqing-US aircraft shot down, destroyed, and set on fire has reached more than 280, so the Chongqing-US Air Force has fallen into a major crisis.</p>
<p>Continental Base, 14th (Central Electric News Agency) - On the morning of the 14th, a fleet of Japanese bombers raided the Danzhu airdrome in Guangxi Province, braving the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army, and dropped many giant bombs. The Chongqing aircraft and attached facilities on the ground were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft completed their mission and returned safely to their base.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle of Hengyang Reaches Climax; Japanese Air Force Actively Deployed</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced in a war bulletin on the night of the 13th that the fierce battle of Hengyang has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The main offensive launched by the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland front is progressing steadily without pause. The Japanese southward forces on the Yuehan Railway broke through the battle line around Leiyang, south of Hengyang, while the northward forces are pressing near Yunjiang. The two forces are only 250 kilometers apart. The Japanese air force in mainland China is also cooperating with the ground operations and has been actively deployed for days. Since the Japanese army launched the main offensive, it has shot down, destroyed, and burned a total of 600 enemy aircraft, including 40 in mid-April, 160 in mid-May, and 200 in mid-June. This remarkable result is truly astonishing. After entering July, the Japanese air force has been exerting its power even more fiercely. In the nine days from the 7th to the 13th, it annihilated 106 enemy aircraft in one fell swoop. In this surprise attack on Zhijiang, 51 enemy aircraft were destroyed and burned. If the results since April are calculated together, the number of enemy aircraft destroyed exceeds 557. Currently, the Japanese air force is using the enemy air force's forward base as its own forward base, and its active area is expanding. The Japanese army has captured Luoyang in North China and destroyed the Lushi airfield. In Central and South China, it has also seized Changsha and brought the Weiyang airfield under its control. The intention to occupy the Hengyang airfield is particularly important because it is the communication hub for enemy bases in the Central and South China regions. Once this location is lost, bases in the east such as Jian'ou, Suichuan, Yushan, and Lishui will completely lose contact. Similarly, bases in the west such as Lingling and Banyang will become ineffective due to the active deployment of the Japanese air force based in Weiyang and Changsha. This forces the New Fourth Route Army to retreat its main air force force to the southwestern interior with Kunming as the center and the northwestern interior with Chengdu as the center, while using bases in Guilin, Dantu, and Zhijiang, which have always served as second-line bases, as the first line against the Japanese army. Guilin is 850 kilometers from Chengdu, and Luoyang is 930 kilometers from Chengdu, so the first frontline base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has retreated nearly 1,000 kilometers. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been striving to advance its first-line bases to eastern mainland China since the start of the Greater East Asia War for two purposes: first, to attempt to attack the Japanese mainland by air and threaten Japan's maritime transport in the western Pacific; and second, to lure the Nimitz offensive in the Pacific theater to the southeastern coast of China. Therefore, the weakening of the first-line bases east of Hengyang has dealt a major blow to the enemy's strategy against Japan. Fearing that the retreat of its bases would affect the value of its presence in Chongqing, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has recently gathered a large number of aircraft at bases in Guilin, Zhijiang, and Dantu, appearing to be determined to defend this air force line. However, many first-line aircraft have been damaged and destroyed by the continuous surprise attacks of Japanese aircraft. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has always aimed to maintain 600 to 700 aircraft on the first line. The Japanese air force's achievement of destroying 557 aircraft in three months is equivalent to the entire first-line aircraft of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. This state of near-total annihilation is something that even the self-reliant United States cannot ignore. General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, is urgently calling out that the Japanese army wants to build a long defense line along the 2,300-kilometer railway from Peiping to Guangzhou. If this ambition can truly be realized, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing will be severely hit, and the end of the war will be delayed for several years.</p>
<h3>Company Commander Zhao Dianwen Heroically Sacrifices Himself</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 14th (Central News Agency) - Captain Zhao Dianwen, a company commander of a certain Shanxi army unit who died heroically in battle, has been posthumously promoted two ranks to colonel for his meritorious service in suppressing bandits. This is an unprecedented honor in the Chinese army. On May 30th, in order to protect the defenses of a position, Captain Zhao went to Huangshashan, northwest of Luan, to conduct reconnaissance when he was ambushed by a bandit group of about 3,700 men based on the newly formed First Brigade. Captain Zhao broke into the enemy ranks five times, finally repelling the enemy, but Company Commander Zhao also died heroically in battle. In this battle, the enemy suffered no fewer than 900 casualties, and 50 rifles and many other military supplies were captured. Colonel Zhao is truly a model soldier who lived and died with his men.</p>
<h3>Burmese Youth's Letter to Japanese Youth</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 14th (Central News Agency) - U Ba Kyiang, President of the Burmese East Asia Youth League, met with Foreign Minister Shigemitsu at the Burmese Embassy in Tokyo on the second anniversary of the League's founding and conveyed a letter from Burmese youth to Japanese youth, the contents of which are as follows: On this second anniversary of the East Asia Youth League, we, the Burmese youth, sincerely express our admiration to the Japanese youth. We, the Burmese youth, have joined hands during this Greater East Asia War to liberate all of East Asia from the oppression and domination of the Anglo-Saxons and vow to completely destroy our common enemy.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Shell Tinian Island</h3>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 14th (Central News Agency) - Enemy warships and enemy positions on Saipan Island heavily shelled Tinian Island during the day on the 10th. Enemy destroyer squadrons also shelled the island on the same night.</p>
<h3>Gendarmerie Headquarters Disciplines Unscrupulous Soldiers</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Central Gendarmerie Headquarters, noting that there are often unscrupulous soldiers in Nanjing who violate laws and regulations and extort money from merchants and civilians, has been strictly investigating. If any such misconduct continues, the perpetrators will be detained. Victims who encounter such unscrupulous officers and soldiers are permitted to file complaints, which should be sent to the Headquarters for investigation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoys in North China Hold Meeting to Review Material and Food Issues</h3>
<p>Beijing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Beijing Office of the Japanese Embassy in China will hold a meeting of embassies under its jurisdiction at 9:30 a.m. on the 14th to review the development and transportation of materials, the purchase of food, and other important current issues in North China. Minister Izawa and other department heads and relevant officials from the Embassy, as well as the consuls general from Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, Datong, and Kalgan, and the consuls from Zhangdian and Tangshan, will attend. In addition, the Consul General from Xuzhou will also be present.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders Banks and Money Shops to Be Cautious in Lending</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the 6th of this month, the Ministry of Finance specially ordered the Banking and Money Shop Associations of Nanjing and Shanghai to instruct their member banks and money shops to handle loans carefully in accordance with the original regulations. It also notified the Central Reserve Bank to consider loans carefully and strictly. Those who engage in speculation and manipulation will be severely punished, and useful funds will not be allowed to be used to manipulate the gold market. The authorities have been separately and strictly investigating major households that secretly engage in manipulation.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes British and American Incompetence</h3>
<p>Beijing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing Kuomintang newspaper (Xijing Daily) in Xi'an recently pointed out the difficulties on the European invasion front and criticized the incompetence of Britain and the United States in its editorials. The gist is as follows: Although the anti-Axis forces have launched an invasion front in Europe, the defense of the German army should not be underestimated. It took the anti-Axis forces 72 days to capture Rome, and there are still many key areas in mainland Europe, like Rome, under the control of the Axis powers. We must also remember that Japan's mainland offensive is still fierce, and bloody battles are continuing on the Henan-Hunan and Burmese fronts. At the same time, Chongqing is becoming increasingly disadvantaged, and it is still unable to stop the Japanese army's advance. Although Britain and the United States said at the Cairo Conference that the European and Far Eastern theaters were linked, the U.S. military has not provided assistance on the mainland battlefield. Why is this? If the delay continues like this, we will only be doomed to destruction.</p>
<p>Numerous Factions in Chongqing</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New York, American journalist Drew Pearson wrote an article in the Washington Post on the 10th exposing the inside story of the Chongqing regime, giving a great shock to all parties. He said: Judging from the diplomatic reports from Chongqing and the accounts of those who accompanied the Vice President on his visit to Chongqing, Chongqing is still a burden to the anti-Axis camp. American journalists stationed in Chongqing are almost treated like prisoners due to strict censorship, and the relationship between the United States and Chongqing is certainly not friendly. The U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing cannot meet with Chiang Kai-shek, who often refuses to see him on various pretexts. The various parties and factions within the Chongqing regime are very active. The warlords and officials in Chongqing are resentful of Soong Mei-ling, who uses military supplies aided by the United States to deal with the Communists.</p>
<h3>Imperial University Professor Investigates Cotton Production in Various Places</h3>
<p>Baoding, 14th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ito Choji, former Director of Southern Administration and Professor at Kyushu Imperial University, and Assistant Professor Koyama Maoru of the same university, departed from Shanghai some days ago to inspect the fiber resources such as cotton, yellow hemp, and ramie, as well as the general agricultural conditions in various parts of China. They went to Nanjing, Huzhou, Peiping, and Shandong for inspection. They came to Baoding on the 9th and departed the next day to inspect the Ximeng Xinjiang region.</p>
<h3>Reports of Soong Mei-ling Arriving in Brazil for Recuperation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Havas News Agency reports that Soong Mei-ling arrived in the capital of Brazil on Thursday and is said to be staying for several weeks to recuperate.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: According to news from London, the German counterattack east of Caen has forced British troops to retreat from the villages of Colombelles and Sante Honorine to the opposite bank of the Odon River and the Caen Canal.</p>
<h3>Philippine Government to Handle Controlled Distribution</h3>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to implement the agreement to transfer economic rights and interests to the Philippine government, the Japanese have recently transferred the affairs of controlling the distribution of essential consumer goods, which they previously managed, to the Philippine government. Currently, in order to adjust its organization, the Philippine side has reorganized the former Philippine Essential Goods Administration and established a fully controlled distribution agency, the National Commodity Purchase and Distribution Company. The company is capitalized at one million pesos and operates under the direct jurisdiction of President Laurel. On the other hand, because the Philippine agency for the distribution of essential consumer goods has been transferred to the Philippine government for self-management, the Japanese have reorganized the Philippine Import and Export Materials Management and Control Association and established a new Non-Trade Distribution Association, with a Trade Distribution Department, to be responsible for the development and distribution of essential consumer goods and materials. The Trade Department handles the business of the Import and Export Materials Management Association.</p>
<h3>German Commander Inspects Defenses; Center of Battle Shifts to Saint-Lô; Repeated American Offensives Encounter Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch: German Western Supreme Commander Field Marshal Kluge has been inspecting the German positions along the Dover Strait for days, especially the area around Dunkirk and Abbeville.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 13th: The center of the battle in northern France has once again shifted to the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula, with great damage to the Americans. The current operational objectives of the American army have shifted to Saint-Lô and Saint-Elist. The enemy forces in the Saint-Lô area are expanding the small salient formed the other day and approaching Saint-Lô from the east and north. The enemy forces between the Vire River and the west coast of the Cotentin Peninsula are repeatedly launching stubborn offensives, attempting to encircle Periers. The enemy vanguard advancing eastwards along the Vire River has reached Pont-Hebert, while the vanguard advancing westwards along the La Haye-du-Puits-Lessay highway has reached Angoville. Near Saint-Lô, a German combat division is confronting three American combat divisions. German armored units have been launching surprise attacks behind enemy lines to disrupt enemy positions. In addition to advancing southwards, the enemy is also attempting to counterattack from the east. The offensive on the 12th was repeatedly countered by German forces and did not achieve significant results.</p>
<h3>Flying Bombs Continue to Disrupt London; Population Evacuation</h3>
<p>Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German flying bomb attacks on London stopped for a time on the evening of the 12th. Londoners believed that the German bases had been destroyed by the British Air Force and could not continue to launch them. However, from the morning of the 13th, the annoying flying bombs came one after another, and the slightly relieved mood of the citizens became tense again. They evacuated and took refuge. About 13,000 elementary and female students fled that day. The British press criticized the London authorities for improper procedures in handling the evacuation of the population.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Explains German War Aims; Save European Civilization from Ruin</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the Deutsche Magazine stating that the war aims of Germany and its allies are much closer to the peace desired by the world than those of the anti-Axis countries. What all countries hope for is national progress, social reform, economic prosperity, and peace and happiness, which can be achieved through the efforts of all countries and cannot be obtained by sacrificing other countries. What Germany hopes for is the same as what the whole world hopes for. As far as Germany is concerned, it does not have to resort to war and can still achieve this goal. If the enemy does not force Germany to fight, Germany would have been able to achieve this goal long ago. If the financiers and Bolshevik leaders of the enemy countries did not act contrary to this intention, most of their goals could also be achieved. If the anti-Axis forces win, there will only be the process of destruction as announced by the British and American governments, that is, allowing the communists to turn Europe into hell, and there will be no hope for happiness and prosperity. The enemy used the Treaty of Versailles to bind Germany and plunged Germany, Europe, and the world into chaos for twenty years, until the opportunity came to break out of this tragic situation when there was no other way but war. In this war, the Germans have never advocated destruction and devastation, not because they feel their strength is insufficient, but because they are concerned about civilization. Only communism harbors this ambition. The cooperation between the British and the Soviets is no different from playing with fire. The Kremlin has its own methods that are contrary to those of Britain and the United States, and Britain and the United States are actually manipulated by Stalin. If it is said that the anti-Axis military is beneficial, it is only building a road for the Soviets to enter Europe.</p>
<h3>Turkish Ambassador to Germany Returns Home by Plane</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ankara, Turkish Ambassador to Germany Yalikan returned to Istanbul by plane on the 13th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency reports that US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt has returned to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - The United States' pressure on neutral countries has become increasingly apparent recently, and there seems to be a movement within the United States to strengthen pressure on neutral countries.</p>
<h3>General de Gaulle Returns to North Africa</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: According to news from London, General de Gaulle returned to Algiers on the evening of the 13th after visiting the United States and Canada.</p>
<h3>German Forces on the Eastern Front Withdraw from Vilnius; Soviet Forces Approach Lithuanian Border</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German authorities recently announced that German forces in Vilnius withdrew after completely destroying all important facilities and have now joined the main German forces. In this battle, German forces captured many Soviet troops and seized many weapons, while the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses and the German forces suffered very slight losses.</p>
<p>Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Union announced last night that Soviet forces had occupied Zarno and that these units had advanced to a certain location southeast of Kaunas, 35 miles from the East Prussian border.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency reports: There is still fierce fighting in the Kovel area. Soviet forces have repeatedly attacked from the flanks but have not succeeded. The enemy forces wanted to expand their offensive to the southwest, resulting in heavy losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - When German authorities met with a group of journalists on the 13th, they denied the rumors that German forces were shortening the battle line in the three Baltic states and stated that the German forces in the Baltic states were only retreating slightly in order to improve the defensive positions in the Baltic states due to changes in the war situation. The Baltic states are a part of Europe, and German forces are determined to maintain the defensive strength in the northern and southern parts of the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>The Movements of the Balkan Countries Are of Decisive Importance to the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Balkan countries were the tinderbox of World War I. In this great war, they are also of decisive importance to the war situation. In particular, since the anti-Axis forces landed in Northern France, the impact on the Balkan countries has become the focus of worldwide attention. The following is an introduction to the recent political situation in the Balkans in the Allied Weekly: The relationship between the Balkans and Germany is similar to the relationship between Japan and the Greater East Asian countries, and it is an indispensable rear base for Germany to complete the war. Therefore, the political situation in each country is not a small factor in the German military strength.</p>
<p>Anti-Axis Political Offensive</p>
<p>The following is an overview of the movements of the various countries in the half year since the Tehran Conference, as a basis for future predictions. The development of the Eastern Front and the situation in Italy have had a profound impact on the Balkan countries. This cannot be denied. Most noteworthy is the political offensive of the anti-Axis countries against the Balkans after the Tehran Conference. Among them, the Soviet political pressure backed by the success of the Eastern Front, and the Anglo-American strategies threatening the invasion of Europe, have failed in their results and have instead promoted closer relations between Germany and the Balkans. However, its impact has not been completely eradicated to this day. This can be asserted. The following is a description of the situation in the Balkan countries one by one:</p>
<p>Romania-Germany Cooperation Strengthens Anti-Communism</p>
<p>Since mid-March, the Soviet vanguard has been stationed on Romanian territory, and another part has been advancing from the northern Carpathians via Tarnopol and Lemberg towards Sziláca in Hungary. Until the summer of 1940, Romania still had a strong Anglo-French flavor. Today, it is facing a major turning point of life and death. Britain and the United States, in view of this, extended the magic hands of their political strategies and repeatedly bombed Bucharest and Braila indiscriminately. Under the strong leadership of Prime Minister Antonescu, Romania strongly combined with the German military and political forces, forming the most peaceful country in the Balkans. In addition, the Romanian people are terrified of the approaching Soviet forces, and their anti-communist stance has become stronger. Furthermore, the indiscriminate bombing by the Anglo-American air force has aroused the resentment of the Romanian people. Currently, German-Romanian joint forces are participating in the war near Iasi, but it cannot be said that there are no wavering people among the general public due to the military and political strategies of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Defending Oil Fields is an Established Policy</p>
<p>Molotov's statement on April 2 and the Soviet army's crossing of the Prut River and breaking into Romanian territory aroused major repercussions. Furthermore, the Soviet Union and the Czech government-in-exile concluded an agreement on April 30, and the Soviet army launched a roundabout operation from the Carpathians, indicating that the Soviet army was clearly going to attack Czechoslovakia, which was bound to attract the attention of Romania. Stalin's announcement on May 1 to attack Romania was quite noteworthy. Regardless of the psychological impact on Romania, Romania's will to resist has become stronger in terms of the situation. Although the Anglo-American air force's indiscriminate bombing of Bucharest caused great damage to the city, the damage to the oil field area was very slight. The German government issued a statement in early April, saying that no matter what the sacrifice, it would definitely protect Romania and would never retreat. This is not only to protect the country's oil fields, but also to ensure the stability of the entire Balkans, which is an inevitable policy. Therefore, although German forces continued to retreat on the Eastern Front, there was no movement in the area around the Prut River.</p>
<p>The Remnants of the Hungarian Reactionaries Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>After the Soviet army entered Bessarabia on March 17, the German army also entered Hungarian airfields and traffic hubs on the 19th. Important factories were also completely defended by the German army. On the 20th, the German leader met with Hungarian Regent Horthy, and as a result, the cabinet was reorganized on the 22nd. Hungary and Italy were friendly, and after Italy surrendered last summer, Hungary showed signs of wavering. After the Stojay government took office this time, it swept away the wavering elements, cooperated closely with Germany, and used strong measures to suppress the Jews, dissolve political parties related to the Jews, and seal up newspapers. This move can also be said to be a kind of social revolution. The German side replaced Minister Clodius and sent Wessenmayer as the German Plenipotentiary, granting him special powers and forming a completely close cooperative relationship with the Hungarian government, but it has not yet been fully completed.</p>
<p>British Strategies are Very Noteworthy</p>
<p>In late March, the Hungarian Committee of the government-in-exile was established in London and will begin activities in Hungary. The chairman of the committee served as the President of the Hungarian Republic during the 1918 revolution after World War I, and has been living in exile abroad since 1920. This is also a part of the British political strategy and is very noteworthy. The Stojay cabinet's system of final battles progressed extremely smoothly. In addition to implementing the reorganization of the national army and mobilizing men over the age of seventeen, Pablik was sent to Germany in mid-May to discuss issues of cooperation with Germany. Hungary is a powerful ally of Germany, and the cooperation provided by its rear military base is quite considerable. The assistance given to Germany by its aviation machinery industry is particularly commendable.</p>
<h3>Spanish Navy Supreme Council</h3>
<p>Madrid, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: According to sources close to the matter, the Supreme Council of the Spanish Fleet, held under the chairmanship of Navy Minister Moreno, closed on the 13th after several days of discussions. The marshals and generals who participated in the meeting returned to their posts on the same day.</p>
<h3>Northern France War and Turkey</h3>
<p>The invasion operation launched in Northern France seems to have greatly affected Turkey in the eastern corner of Europe. During the five years of the Great War, Turkey was both an ally of Britain and a friend of Germany, resisting the heavy pressure from Britain to join the war, and dealing with the shrewd Ambassador Papen of the US and German diplomatic circles, and finally came to the dangerous bridge of non-belligerent status. President İsmet İnönü, regardless of how the second front develops, only insists on the principle of not participating if Britain does not participate. This is clearly determined based on observations from all sides, but whether the President's policy can continue is indeed a major question.</p>
<p>Two Pressures</p>
<p>Regarding the military and political situation in Turkey after the opening of the second front, according to a military expert returning to Budapest on the 15th, a section of the Turkish political circles judged the second front, believing that the current Northern France operation is a major continental offensive and defensive main battle in which Britain and the United States are burning their boats and exerting all their efforts, that is, the formal second front, and the final outcome of the European war will be decided by this. In addition to these internal factors, one should not ignore the many external factors that are actively pressuring Turkey to join the war. First, the pressure from Britain and the United States is increasing. Recently, due to German ships passing through the Dardanelles Strait, Britain and the United States took the opportunity to put pressure on Turkey, using the pretext that German ships were carrying munitions, and seriously presented Turkey with an ultimatum-like protest, demanding an immediate severance of trade relations with Germany. Turkey has tried its best to delay its reply in order to avoid a crisis, but the problem depends on the extent to which Britain and the United States will continue to exert pressure, the extent to which Turkey will persist, and the extent of Germany's influence on the Balkans.</p>
<p>The second factor is Turkey's judgment on the political situation in Bulgaria. That is to say, based on the recent arrest of Bulgarian Chief of General Staff Lukacs, and the subsequent coup and the election of a new cabinet, Turkey believes that the political situation in Bulgaria still has room for flexibility. The third point related to this is that the Soviet Union, on the one hand, has prepared its forces for a summer offensive in southern Romania, and on the other hand, the preparations for a landing operation on the Bulgarian coast from the Crimean Peninsula are already in place. Therefore, from Turkey's point of view, the Soviet Union's attempt to advance from southern Romania towards Bulgaria, which is close to the Dardanelles Strait, has become a reality.</p>
<p>Participation Pending</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union's operation against Bulgaria is realized. However, from Turkey's point of view, Turkey's lifeline, the Dardanelles Strait, has been threatened by the Soviet Union from the European side, so Turkey must prepare for defense in any case. Then perhaps it will turn to Germany, which is based in the Balkans. If it is believed that such a future is unreliable, then it will follow Britain and the United States and immediately launch a war, advancing into the Balkans. Thus, the Turkish question arises. At the same time, according to current intelligence, the Turkish military indeed contains the danger of opening another second front.</p>
<p>However, whether Turkey's participation in the war can really be realized depends on the subtle and complicated results of the various factors mentioned above, and it is not possible to make predictions at this time. But what can be relied upon for accurate judgment is: first, how capable Germany is of resisting the Soviet Union's advance into the Balkans; second, whether Germany can extinguish the second front of Britain and the United States in Western Europe; and third, how Germany will deal with the second front speculated by the Turkish military, and the ambitions of Britain and the United States in the Balkans. In short, it depends on Germany's armed forces. Therefore, as long as Germany has an unshakeable and strong copper wall and steel fortress in the Balkans, like the Atlantic Wall, then the changes in Turkey's political situation today can follow Germany's triumphant progress without materializing. At the same time, the atmosphere of participation in the war surrounding Turkey can be dispelled like fog, otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

<h3>Air Defense Authorities Revise Traffic and Sound Control: Vehicle Horns Should Use Short Sounds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai air defense authorities have recently strengthened traffic and sound control during alert periods. Regarding traffic control, all vehicles and pedestrians must stop traffic five minutes after the alert is issued. This has been implemented in several air defense drills, and the general public is gradually becoming accustomed to it. However, clear regulations regarding sound control have not yet been established, especially when the horns of vehicles are sounding in a confusing manner, the hearing of pedestrians on the road is often obstructed. When alarms are sounded, the roads sometimes become chaotic. In view of this, the local army and navy air defense command headquarters of this city issued Notice No. 25 yesterday (the 14th), revising the traffic control regulations stipulated in Notice No. 24. From now on, after an alarm is issued, the volume of car horns and other sound-making devices should be limited to between 70 and 100 decibels. As prolonged sounds may be mistaken for alarms, it is also stipulated that short sounds should be used. The authorities' notice and statement are recorded below:</p>
<p>Notice Content</p>
<p>(Notice No. 25), Regarding the issuance of a notice: It is hereby notified that the following item should be added to Item 5 of Notice No. 24 of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command Headquarters, and the numbers in Appendix 1 of Special Notice No. 2 of the Shanghai Air Defense Sound and Traffic Control Regulations should be extended sequentially. This notice is to be widely promulgated.</p>
<p>Enumerated: 6. Sound control of vehicles should be handled at all times in accordance with the following regulations. A. The volume of horns should be between 70 and 100 decibels. B. When using horns, short sounds should be used.</p>
<p>Addendum: This notice shall take effect from July 25th.</p>
<p>Statement by the Air Defense Command Headquarters Authorities</p>
<p>Notice No. 25 aims to control vehicle horns, which have been in a state of laissez-faire, in accordance with air defense necessities.</p>
<p>The first regulation is that the volume of horns should be between 70 and 100 decibels. One hundred decibels is the maximum necessary limit for vehicle operation. If driving slowly, the volume can be reduced to as low as 65 decibels, which should not cause traffic accidents. The control device is extremely simple. It is only necessary to stuff the horn with cloth or cover the horn opening with a piece of cloth.</p>
<p>Those who are unable to understand the standard sound level should refer to vehicles that have passed inspection or samples prepared by the Air Defense Command Headquarters and complete the control device as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The second Notice No. 24 stipulates that horns should not be used during alarm periods except when absolutely necessary. However, when it is absolutely necessary to use them, short sounds should be used instead of long sounds, so as not to interfere with air defense listening.</p>
<p>This notice is effective during alarm periods, but it must also be implemented during non-alarm periods. Therefore, all car owners should fully understand the purpose of this notice in order to achieve the practical effect of sound control.</p>

<h3>Reissuance of Residence Permits: Strictly Prevent Malpractice; Procedures to Be Streamlined</h3>
<p>The Baojia (Household Registration) Department of the First Police Bureau of this city has begun reissuing new residence permits since April 1st of this year, and has specially formulated guidelines for issuing residence permits, ordering all police bureaus to strictly comply with them. The situation in the districts under their jurisdiction is very good. In order to provide citizens with further clarity, so that citizens can quickly complete the renewal period and avoid misunderstandings with the police sub-bureaus, Gu Jiwu, the head of the Baojia Department, gave the following remarks to reporters:</p>
<p>Since the issuance of new certificates began, many conveniences have been provided to citizens in the district in handling procedures. However, there are inevitably various reasons why they are not fully appreciated, causing citizens to feel troubled, and even a few Baojia sections of the sub-bureaus have not fully complied or there have been cases of malpractice, which has aroused resentment among some citizens. The Baojia authorities are paying close attention to this and are earnestly instructing each police sub-bureau to strictly implement the regulations, with the primary goal of facilitating citizens. In addition, the bureau chief has approved the direct dispatch of personnel to inspect and provide guidance. Citizens can directly file complaints with the relevant police sub-bureaus or report secretly to the Baojia Department if they experience inconvenience or suffering. If the facts are verified, the authorities will strictly keep the informants confidential. In short, this department is handling Baojia matters and reissuing residence permits, etc., and will do everything possible to facilitate citizens and achieve the ideal of a close relationship. Furthermore, if various police sub-bureaus have their own limited circumstances during the reissuance period, there may be some flexibility in the retreat vehicle regulations. Recently, some sub-bureaus have also handled procedures on Sunday mornings. For those with various special reasons, those who need to make fingerprints and those who need to reissue documents, as well as the reissuance procedures for national institutions, etc., and also because other sub-bureaus do not work in the afternoons, from now on, all sub-bureaus must ensure that citizens are absolutely free from crowding and waiting time when handling procedures within the prescribed time.</p>

Within the above-mentioned prescribed period, citizens may use the above-mentioned ration ticket to purchase one "Registered No." labeled bag of No. 2 flour (one catty), and half a catty of corn flour from the rice store for a total price of 27 yuan (national currency). Also, all rice stores and the district's rice warehouses will be closed for one day on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>First and Second Police Bureaus to Merge</h3>
<p>In order to complete the unification of the police administration in this city, the city government authorities will formally merge the First and Second Police Bureaus of this city into the Shanghai Special City Police Bureau from August 1st, to govern the city's police administration. A "Preparatory Committee for the Merger of the First and Second Police Bureaus" has been established, which will handle the preparatory merger matters. Mayor Chen will serve as the chairman of the committee, and the vice chairmen will be Su Chengde and Du Zhengjian Luxuying. The list of committee members has also been decided and will be announced in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>
<p>In the "Common Sense of Air Raid Alarms" table published on the 13th and 14th, the signal for the air raid alarm to be lifted was "every 15 seconds," which was mistakenly written as "one minute and five seconds." This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Minister of Justice Zhang Diagnosed and Treated in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Minister of Justice Administration, after inspecting the judicial situation in North China, felt physically exhausted due to his advanced age and the fatigue of the journey. He fell ill in Nanjing on the 5th of this month and came to Shanghai on the 7th, where he was admitted to Fuxing Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. However, his condition worsened, and Dr. Le Wenzhao, who was in charge of the treatment, diagnosed him with typhus. It has been nine days, and his condition is quite serious. Yesterday, the Japanese Embassy also sent a famous doctor to examine him. It is reported that he is following the doctor's advice for treatment, and all inquiries from guests are declined.</p>
<h3>Two Police Bureaus Cooperate to Collect Special Consumption Tax</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the order to levy the special consumption tax in this city, the tax collection situation in each district has been extremely good. In the Huainan area, there are many violations of the order regarding the payment of the special consumption tax, which is a violation of the government orders. Therefore, in order to effectively rectify this situation, the Baoshan District Tax Sub-Bureau specially requested the Second Police Bureau of the city to notify the Third Police Sub-Bureau of Nanshi to fully cooperate in the collection.</p>
<h3>Donation Report for Vagrant Labor Camp</h3>
<p>(July 4th to 12th) Great China Rubber Factory, 15,000 yuan; Gao Peiliang, Meitai Chemical Industrial Factory, Defu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, 5,000 yuan each. Shanghai Special City Toothbrush Industry Association, 1,000 yuan; Huaxin Heji Welding Factory, Jinchang Welding Factory, Qunsheng Welding Factory, 500 yuan each. The total received is 32,500 yuan, bringing the total received to 552,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>Essential Points for Building Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>Materials for Deflecting Shrapnel</p>
<p>A layer of soil 80 centimeters (approximately 2 chi and 6 cun) thick on the ground is sufficient to prevent shrapnel penetration.</p>
<p>In addition: 1. A mixture of soil and sand, 70 centimeters; 2. Planks and boards joined tightly with stones, tiles, etc., 50 centimeters; 3. Piles of wood, 50 centimeters; 4. Layers of stacked mats, 90 centimeters; 5. Piles of cushions, 100 centimeters; 6. Stacks of books, paper, etc., 40 centimeters. These thicknesses can also prevent shrapnel penetration. If the materials for deflecting shrapnel do not belong to these categories, such as a shop, the shop itself is a good material. In general, the heavier the material, the more effective it is. Furthermore, the thickness does not necessarily need to be as described above. A little thicker or thinner can also achieve a considerable effect.</p>
<p>When building an air raid shelter on the floor of a room, surround it with the materials listed above to create a shelter. However, special attention must be paid to not obstructing daily life and work.</p>
<h3>Hua Zhong Public Bus Special License Style</h3>
<p>In order to save materials and unify standards, the Ministry of Construction of the National Government has specially issued special licenses for public buses belonging to the Hua Zhong Railway Company. They have a blue background and white characters with the character "特" (special) and their license number for identification, and they can freely pass through Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shanghai, and Nanjing, without paying license fees to local authorities.</p>
<h3>Hua Tie Receives Press</h3>
<p>Hua Zhong Railway Company held a banquet at the Capital Hotel at 12:30 p.m. yesterday (the 14th) to entertain reporters from various newspapers in this city. There was lively conversation and a very harmonious atmosphere. The gathering ended happily at around 2 p.m.</p>
<h3>Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Empty Stocks: Deputy Director Su Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The authorities' plans to order the liquidation of stocks that have fallen below par value have attracted widespread attention. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter visited the First Police Bureau and was received by Deputy Director Su Chengde, who issued a statement that said, in essence:</p>
<p>In order to promote the revival of investment, promote the development of industry and commerce, and strive for industrial production, the government approved the establishment of the Chinese Stock Exchange last winter for legal stock trading. Unexpectedly, some unscrupulous merchants disregarded the government's original intention and engaged in speculative and illegal profiteering, and falsely established companies to issue empty stocks to defraud funds. Since the spring of this year, the stock market has been in a slump, with stock values falling sharply. Some stocks have even fallen to less than half of their original par value, and middle- and lower-level merchants have suffered greatly. The police bureau has been paying close attention to this issue. As a result of a thorough investigation, it has been determined that the biggest problem lies in the fact that general unscrupulous merchants have falsely established companies and issued stocks to the market, while their internal organizations are not sound. Therefore, the police bureau has decided to crack down on empty stocks, and will severely crack down on stocks issued by companies that are internally empty and have no actual production. They will be ordered to liquidate themselves, sell their assets, and recover the stocks at their original price in order to prevent illegal practices. It is hoped that merchants with the above-mentioned circumstances will immediately liquidate themselves and recover their stocks, so as to avoid being investigated by the authorities and violating the law, which would lead to severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention Authorities Implement Mandatory Injections: To Be Completed Within Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Since the epidemic prevention injection work in this city began in May, the hygiene administration authorities, in addition to temporarily setting up 68 epidemic prevention injection stations, have also drawn nurses and doctors from designated medical institutions to form 15 teams to conduct injection work in the important thoroughfares of the city. Since the beginning of the work, the number of citizens who have received voluntary or mandatory injections has reached more than 2.1 million to date. The proportion is still quite different from the city's population. If an epidemic occurs, it will inevitably be endless. For the sake of prevention, the Epidemic Prevention Committee has, in addition to sending letters to the police bureau to ask for police assistance in inspections, stated that citizens who do not have an epidemic prevention injection certificate should be forced to be injected. They also asked the Baojia Department to check the epidemic prevention certificate when citizens renew their residence permits, and those who have not been injected should be notified to be injected, otherwise they will not be issued a permit. The hygiene administration authorities hope that citizens will not avoid injections and should complete them within two weeks to protect the health of citizens.</p>
<p>Cholera Response Guidelines</p>
<p>The city's epidemic prevention work is being actively promoted by the city's health authorities. Cholera prevention injections have entered the mandatory injection phase, so that all citizens are injected to stop the occurrence of epidemics. Yesterday, the health authorities issued the following cholera response guidelines:</p>
<p>The cholera prevention injection is originally intended to suppress the occurrence of epidemics. However, the general working class in this city has limited hygiene knowledge and cannot fundamentally understand the epidemic prevention measures implemented by the government, and there are many observations to avoid prevention injections. Therefore, it is feared that the occurrence of cholera in this year will, in fact, be unavoidable. The city's health authorities have already made preparations for the issue of handling cholera after it occurs for the sake of preparedness. In the measures to be taken after the occurrence of cholera, the first is the isolation, admission, and treatment of patients. Before the recovery of the two concessions, there was often isolation. Now that the city is unified, all matters should be planned and handled in a unified manner.</p>
<p>Isolation Hospitals</p>
<p>According to the situation of rampant cholera in this city the year before last, there were 2,986 patients. In 1938, there were approximately 7,000 cholera patients in this city. The dangerous period for patients is approximately within three days. From the time of occurrence to the date of discharge, it is approximately 10 days to 14 days. Therefore, this city needs to have 800 fixed beds to be sufficient. Currently, the isolation hospitals in this city include the Beihai Road Isolation Hospital in the First District, with 100 beds; the Isolation Hospital in the Eighth District, with 200 beds; the Local Hospital, with 100 beds; the Nanshi Isolation Hospital, with 100 beds; the Hub North Infectious Disease Hospital, with 100 beds; the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, with approximately 200 beds; and the Daxi Road Emergency Epidemic Hospital, with 60 beds. The Hygiene Bureau in the Huaxi area is already reorganizing the Huaxi Municipal Hospital into an isolation hospital and plans to set up 100 beds. In addition, there are enthusiastic people in this city who have established temporary epidemic hospitals in the past. It is expected that this city will have no difficulty in solving the problem of accommodating cholera patients this year. As for the rural areas, such as Gaoqiao, Chuansha, Zhoupu, Minhang, and Baoshan, the municipal clinic institutions in this city will set up temporary isolation rooms as usual. Unfortunately, the villagers are ignorant and do not know to go to the hospital for treatment when cholera occurs, and instead risk their lives with wandering doctors who treat boils and other ailments. In the future, it is hoped that the authorities of each special district office will immediately consult with the institutions when encountering suspected cholera cases and handle them in accordance with the regulations for dealing with statutory infectious diseases, take samples and send them to the chemical examination institutions in this city for identification, and strive to promote the establishment of temporary epidemic hospitals to prevent emergencies.</p>
<p>As for the treatment, according to the statistics of treatment in previous years, seriously ill patients account for approximately 20% to 25%. These seriously ill patients must be treated with glucose and other cardiac tonics, and the rest must be treated with physiological saline solution. The health authorities in this city have made sufficient preparations for these medicines and do not lack them.</p>
<p>Bacterial Examination</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the bacterial examination. If a citizen is unfortunately infected with cholera, the first examination is conducted by personnel dispatched by each hygiene branch or hygiene office, who will collect the feces of the patient and their cohabitants or neighbors and send them to the pathological examination room of the First District Hygiene Office for chemical examination. Afterwards, the isolation hospital where the patient is located will be responsible for collecting samples and sending them to the examination room for examination. However, it has been found that isolation hospitals in previous years have failed to conduct strict examinations on patients, which has resulted in the recurrence of the disease in patients. This year, the hygiene department should strictly enforce the bacterial examination, and patients should only be allowed to be discharged from the hospital after the test results are confirmed to be negative, in order to ensure safety. Thirdly, there is the issue of sealing off the epidemic area. When a cholera epidemic occurs, the administrative authorities should seal off the area in accordance with the regulations for handling infectious diseases in order to prevent its spread. After the incident, the epidemic prevention was handled by the Allied Nations. In the past, when cholera occurred in places such as Nanshi, the Allied Nations authorities sealed off the area and implemented inspections. Now, in order to respect the integrity of our country's sovereignty, the Allied Nations authorities have returned the responsibility for epidemic prevention affairs to our country. The cutting off of transportation and the searching of the epidemic area have been closely coordinated by the city's epidemic prevention committee with the police bureau and the Baojia to strictly implement them. Regarding other work, such as disinfection, the hygiene authorities have more than 10 disinfection teams. Whenever cholera occurs, they will be dispatched to work at any time.</p>
<p>As for cholera patients who unfortunately die, this city has notified funeral homes that they are not allowed to take in the bodies of cholera patients without permission and must be handled in accordance with the law for infectious diseases, with cremation as the principle. However, due to the customs of the citizens, it is difficult to promote this for the time being. However, if it is a burial, it must not be close to water sources, the soil must be dug seven feet deep, and a large amount of lime must be buried inside and outside the coffin to prevent it from spreading through the water source.</p>
<h3>Saipan Island Operation: U.S. Military Suffers More Losses Than Gains; Minister Matsushima Delivers Remarks</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 14th), at 2:00 PM, Colonel Matsushima of the Naval Fleet Press Department in Shanghai, as per usual, met with the Chinese Journalist Group at the Naval Attaché's office to answer and report on recent current affairs issues. The key points of the Minister's statement are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Enemy Suffers Grievous Casualties on Saipan</p>
<p>Regarding the recent situation on Saipan Island, Minister Matsushima responded to reporters' inquiries by saying: The U.S. side announced that on the 9th of this month, the United States had completely occupied Saipan. This is a huge error. To date, a large part of the Japanese army is still gathered in northern Saipan, continuing to counterattack the enemy. The enemy's losses are still gradually increasing. Regarding U.S. military losses, the U.S. announced that from June 11th to June 30th, 9,752 personnel were injured, including 1,289 deaths. On July 12th, U.S. Navy Commander Forrestal further announced that from July 1st to July 12th, U.S. military losses amounted to 15,053 personnel, including 2,367 deaths. If we temporarily use these figures as a basis, it is not difficult to imagine the enemy's severe losses in terms of manpower. This Saipan operation was mainly an air battle in June. Since July, it has been a land battle. Judging from the U.S. side's casualties, we can infer the bravery of the Japanese army's combat. The enemy's losses increase with the passage of time. These enemy figures only refer to the land battle. Adding to that the loss of more than fifty of our ships, and the losses of aviation personnel and aircraft, the detailed numbers must be shocking. Even U.S. Admiral Nimitz actually stated that, by the end of June, U.S. naval losses would be twice as high as those in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. However, according to the figures currently released by the U.S., they have already reached four times that amount, which is beyond Nimitz's expectations. If we add the losses of aviation and ships, the number exceeds ten times.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Benefits from Inland Operations</p>
<p>Near Saipan, there are still several islands occupied by the Japanese army. Even if the U.S. military gains Saipan Island, it still cannot use it as a supply base or anchorage. It still needs to use Black Shoal or Hawaii as its main base. Apart from the above two places, there is almost no place west of the Marshall Islands that the U.S. Navy can use. As for Saipan, due to its relationship, it cannot accommodate large aircraft. At the same time, the maritime climate in the area prevents aircraft from flying freely. The United States is currently carrying out a large-scale propaganda campaign on Saipan, depicting its importance. If what the United States says is true, the Japanese army would not have needed to establish bases in Hawaii and the Philippines in the past. Simply holding Saipan would have been enough. Retreating from Saipan, we certainly feel a little regret, but we have been successful in our strategy of luring the enemy deep and engaging in attrition warfare. This point can also stimulate the Japanese production sector, increase output, and be fortunate. Near Saipan, only a small number of ships are active. In land battles, the Japanese army is making a final and heroic stand. Future inland operations will be more advantageous for the Japanese side. Briefly, there are four points: A. After the enemy suffers initial losses, its combat power gradually decreases; B. The Japanese army's supply lines are shortened; C. The main forces of the Japanese army can be easily concentrated to resist the enemy; D. The enemy's losses cannot be repaired or avoided. Since the Japanese have these advantages of inland operations, there is no need to pay too much attention to the gains and losses of Saipan.</p>
<p>Myanmar Representative's Sentimental Remarks</p>
<p>Myanmar representative Ba Tin said in Shanghai that the entire people of Myanmar are now working hard for the Greater East Asia War amidst gunfire. Upon arriving in Japan, he witnessed the solemn and diligent life of the Japanese military and civilians, united in seeking victory in the Greater East Asia War, and their spirit is deeply admirable. However, what he saw in Shanghai was completely different. It was almost impossible to find traces of the war. Young Chinese men and women were living comfortably and enjoying themselves, strolling hand in hand in the streets. They seemed to pay no attention to the future and destiny of China or the future and destiny of East Asia, which he found very puzzling. We also share the same feeling as Ba Tin's remarks. Currently, some people in Shanghai seem to be completely indifferent to the war situation, thinking that it has nothing to do with them. This view is a huge mistake. To put it mildly, even if the Japanese army withdraws from Shanghai and the British and American armies re-enter Shanghai, will they receive the same treatment in life as the current Japanese army in Shanghai? This is a question worth considering. Frankly speaking, the reason why the British and Americans treat the Chinese favorably is because Japan exists. Once Japan leaves China, Britain and the United States will never treat China well again. You should not forget the public notices that read "Chinese and dogs are not allowed to enter." I sincerely advise these people who only care about current enjoyment without considering the future and destiny of the country to savor the consequences of the return of British and American troops to China while enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>China and Japan Share the Same Fate, Sharing Both Joys and Sorrows</p>
<p>As a young officer of the Japanese army, it is my duty to awaken young people in both China and Japan to jointly shoulder the mission entrusted to us by the Greater East Asia War. From my personal belief, only the sincere cooperation of young people in China and Japan can shoulder the heavy responsibility of the future. In the past, there were regrets in the affairs of the two countries, but these were done by the predecessors of the two countries. We do not need to review them at this time. The responsibility for what happens next lies with us young people. Looking at the current situation of some young people in China, especially the young people in Shanghai, it is truly worrying for the future and destiny of China. I will say it again frankly, the fate of China is the same as the fate of the Japanese army. The three routes planned by the American Nimitz to attack Japan, the Chinese route is the most likely. At this time, the Japanese army is fighting bloody battles on the front lines. I hope that these Chinese young people will not stand by with an "onlooker" attitude, but will seriously reflect and practice sharing both joys and sorrows to shoulder the great mission of the future.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Donations from All Walks of Life Are Gradually Increasing; Qualifying Examinations Will Be Held Starting on the 25th</h3>
<p>Since the large number of students applying for this year's reader scholarship, their eagerness to receive assistance, and the actual situation of the insufficient distribution of scholarships were published in detail in the past two days, enthusiastic people have indeed been donating one after another, which is extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday, nearly 200,000 yuan was received. This spirit of doing what is right is inspiring. It is hoped that all readers will continue their efforts to achieve the goal of 10 million yuan in the shortest possible time, or even break the record. The more the better, the more students applying for scholarships this year who are in dire straits will be greatly reduced, and promising young people will all be able to pursue further studies. The effect of education will also be greater and more obvious. As for the qualifying examination, after many contacts with colleagues in this office, it was decided to hold it at Datong University on Xinzha Road. This is because Datong University has spacious halls and beautiful surroundings, located in the center of the city, turning the noisy city into a quiet place. The school authorities have kindly agreed to lend it and provide various conveniences, and their kindness is appreciated. The date is set for the 25th and 26th of this month (Tuesday and Wednesday). The primary school group and junior high school group will be tested first. All the methods will be recorded in detail later.</p>
<p>Excerpts from Letters from All Walks of Life: Mr. Xiang Kangyuan wrote in his letter: "Your newspaper is running scholarships to solve the problem of schooling for poor children. Over the years, the results have been remarkable. Your enthusiasm for public welfare and rewarding school children is admirable. This time, we are expanding the fundraising and organizing a scholarship fundraising team. I am honored to be appointed as the captain of one fundraising team. I will certainly do my best. For the sake of speed, I would like to donate 10,000 yuan from our factory first, to show a token of my respect." Mr. Zou Zilin wrote in his letter: "My mother's 70th birthday, family, relatives and elders suggested that the funds for celebrating my well-wishers be used to help charitable organizations. In addition to my friends' grand ceremonies and Zilin's combined amount, I have made up a total of 1,100,200 yuan, which will be distributed to various charitable organizations (list omitted). I have always admired your newspaper's concern for education and sponsorship of out-of-school youth. Therefore, I have specifically allocated 10,000 yuan from the grand ceremony to donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund, to show a token of my heart and to bless all my relatives and friends." The Dasing Company wrote in a letter: "Dear Sir, Upon the instructions of our General Manager, Mr. Cai Jianmin, I have received your letter of July 6th. I respectfully inform you that your newspaper has organized a scholarship fundraising team with great enthusiasm and vision. I should follow your instructions to take on a team to wrap up righteous deeds and entrust you to send donations. I hereby send 10,000 yuan in national currency with this letter, and I hope that you will check and receive it."</p>
<p>A letter from the preparatory office of the tea party for celebrating the hostess of Yinfenglou's adoption of a goddaughter reads: "Dear Sir, We should hold a tea party for publicly celebrating the hostess of Yinfenglou's adoption of a goddaughter, Zi Yuwei, in the Wanhua Hall. There will be a fee for practicing writing by friends. After the event, there will still be surplus funds. It has now been decided to collect 10,000 yuan to be distributed for the scholarship funds of your newspaper and the News. Please check and receive it."</p>

<h3>Please Decide on the Fate of the Cotton Textile Industry Quickly</h3>
<p>— Hu Qichang</p>
<p>On August 10th last year, the authorities, due to the daily increase in the price of cotton yarn and cloth, and hoarders and speculators manipulating the yarn and cloth as speculative targets, had a huge impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, they issued an order to buy up all the yarn and cloth stored in Shanghai, regardless of whether it was held by manufacturers or households. The fixed price was one-half or one-third of the market price, and it was paid half in gold and half in fixed-term deposit certificates.</p>
<p>Since the war, the cotton textile industry has been unable to supply enough products. Therefore, all circulating funds have been used to add production machines and raw materials, expanding production to supply the demand. The blow was huge, but the authorities originally intended to attack speculation and manipulation to stabilize people's livelihoods. There must be a proper handling method for legitimate and legal manufacturers, so they all waited calmly. Moreover, since then, illegal hoarders have been unable to operate, and the cotton textile industry's past unjust accusation of "manipulation and monopoly" can be clarified to the world, which is also a matter of celebration. The authorities were considerate of the manufacturers and allowed them to retain one month's raw materials for the factory's use, so that production could continue uninterrupted.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Standing Committee promoted the rectification of ideology, increased production, and designated this year as the year of increased production. Administrative officials frequently published high-level opinions on increasing production, and public opinion once again focused on increasing production. The cotton textile industry had been four months from the time of the buy-up to the end of the year, and no funds had been received. The factory workers struggled to maintain operations, and the retained raw materials had also been used up. It was originally hoped that the authorities could complete the purchase work after this period of time, and the method of allocating raw materials and collecting products would be announced soon. It was the day when the cotton textile industry could get out of hardship.</p>
<p>However, to increase production is just empty talk without substance. Today, half of the 33rd year of the Republic of China has passed, and the allocation of raw materials is "only hearing the sound of the stairs, but not seeing anyone coming down". It is even more distant and indefinite. Although manufacturers have the intention to increase production to supply the people's needs and prevent rampant black markets, what can a clever woman do without rice? It is just a waste of effort.</p>
<p>Although there have been reports in the country that production has allocated raw materials to various cloth factories, but there are fewer porridges than monks. With the large number of cloth factories in Shanghai, only a few thousand pieces of cotton yarn are allocated, which is really of no help. After three or several days, the factories will stop production again. With today's high prices and huge expenses, waiting for the production of raw materials that are not known when they will arrive at the factory, the manufacturing cost per piece will be several times higher than the raw materials. And it is still a question whether there will be any raw material allocation in the future. Even if there is, whether the amount will be sufficient? When will it be able to arrive at the factory? With previous experience, no one can say. It is better to close the door as soon as possible than to wait for this allocation that is not known when it will be, with limited capital and fleeting years, and wait for the river to clear, how long will people live?</p>
<p>This time, the Chamber of Commerce was reorganized, with Mr. Wen Kaiheng as the chairman of the board, and Mr. Wen was also appointed as the chairman of the Cotton Industry Management Office. Mr. Wen came from the cotton industry and must be aware of the difficulties suffered by the cotton textile industry. He will be able to sweep away the bureaucratic bad habits of the previous Chamber of Commerce over the past year, which have been unknown. It is hoped that Mr. Wen can learn from the experience of the previous Chamber of Commerce and formulate a practical plan as soon as possible for whether to continue to buy up in the future, whether the allocation will be regular and adequate, or whether to change the method and find another proper way to increase production. After submitting it to the authorities for approval, it will be announced by order of the day, so that the cotton textile factories can know whether the authorities really want to increase production and decide whether to close the door, and so that the law enforcement personnel can also know where to go.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to the Public Works Bureau to Prevent Accidents on the Shangchuan Railway</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanming</p>
<p>After seeing a news report on the first of this month that "the Qiongying Temple in Pudong collapsed and the ferry boat capsized, drowning dozens of workers"; I was reminded of the traffic safety of the Shangchuan Light Railway, which starts from Qiongying Temple and carries thousands of people daily between Shanghai and Chuansha.</p>
<p>The road is now managed by the Municipal Public Works Bureau. It is thought that there is a lack of wartime supplies and that the revenue is not enough to offset the expenses. The vehicles and roads have been allowed to be damaged with the years. In addition, the number of train trips has been reduced to four times a day due to insufficient coal, and the number of passengers has increased several times. The congestion is no less than that of the trams during the time between writing offices, and the heavier the weight, the greater the damage rate of vehicles and roads. Therefore, the gravel of the roadbed is almost as high as the land, and the sleepers of the tracks are completely corroded. In recent years, train derailments have occurred several times a week. Fortunately, each derailment has not caused a fatal disaster. Passengers are used to it, and the road authorities also use the method of treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when they hurt, and only slightly repair the place where the accident occurred. Therefore, the swaying and shaking of the car is like the cradle where babies sleep. If unfortunately the derailment occurs on or near a bridge, the tragedy caused may be ten or a hundred times greater than the Qiongying Temple capsizing tragedy! Even if it is lucky enough to survive, the car may not run again after a year and a half. Whether it is to prevent a major disaster from happening or for the sake of Pudong's transportation in the future, do not just sit idly by and watch the road be damaged day by day until it cannot be driven. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has the responsibility to seek countermeasures quickly, so that a catastrophe can be averted and transportation can be maintained in the future. I respectfully present some humble opinions on the difficulty of material fundraising below for reference:</p>
<p>Sleepers are the most damaged part of the road and the most urgent need at present, and the most expensive one. At this time of extreme shortage of timber and difficult transportation, it is not easy to purchase from other places. If you buy trees planted by the people locally at a reasonable market price, you will not only save time, but also save costs.</p>
<p>Fundraising methods: A. Issue public bonds, allocated according to the land tax revenue of Shangnanchuan three counties. B. Add a surcharge to the tickets sold now. C. Publicly solicit donations from the Pudong Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>For emergency purposes, the funds for this repair project should be applied to the National Bank or the Municipal Government to temporarily pad it first. (Move to Scholarship)</p>

<h3>Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Exhibition to Open Grandly Today</h3>
<p>At 3:00 PM in the Shandong Native Place Association</p>
<p>The "Ancient and Modern Cultural Relics Exhibition" jointly organized by this office and the Shandong Native Place Association, along with eighteen other groups, aims to promote culture and education and promote aesthetics. After a month of preparation, it is now ready. It happens that the Dachang Pavilion has been rebuilt and completed, and it is scheduled to open grandly at the Shandong Native Place Association in East Ximen Road this afternoon at 3:00 PM. At that time, Su Chengde, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Deng, Chen Bingsu, and Cui Jingsan will personally unveil the ceremony and preside over the ceremony, and the movie stars Bai Hong and Zheng Xiaojun will cut the ribbon. The grand occasion is predicted to be unprecedented. The exhibits are divided into gold and stone. Books and paintings. Antiques. Ancient coins. Potted landscape. Photography. Stamps, etc. In a row, no less than work-hour pieces of treasures have been received. Especially the Zhou Dynasty ancient tripod. Bronze gu, Tang and Song inscriptions, famous porcelain of Ming and Qing Dynasties, are all rare treasures in the world and are extremely valuable. They are all Chinese national, ancient and modern. The exhibits will all be sold for charity and the proceeds will be used to handle public welfare undertakings such as scholarships and charity. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will come to visit and actively purchase.</p>
<h3>Madam Zou's 70th Birthday Celebration Moved to Help Various Charities</h3>
<p>Mr. Zou Zilin wrote in a letter: "Respectfully, Madam's 70th birthday, thanks to the suggestion of relatives and elders, the funds for celebrating her well-wishers were moved to charitable causes. A total of 635,400 yuan was received. Combined with the funds saved from the full moon feast of the young child, 300,000 yuan was previously combined by Zilin into a total of 1,100,200 yuan. It was connected to more than 50 group units for distribution, and I deeply feel that it is of no help. I have to bury it in my heart and repay it in the future. My humble sincerity is to bless my relatives and friends. Now, Zilin is usually more concerned and refers to the size of the charitable organization to move to help later, (detailed in another table) I am fortunate if the elegant gentlemen do not criticize the small details.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated into Western Language</p>
<p>Sakura and (Eight)</p>
<p>"Wu Zhen is different from Tokyo; there are no good restaurants. The so-called restaurants are all public eateries."</p>
<p>Zhenren said this, walking towards Dama Road not far from the railway station, and led him to the Fukuda Ryokan &amp; Restaurant. Takao looked at the structure of Room Ten, which was very similar to a famous brothel in Tokyo, so he felt a little scared, but Zhenren's face also seemed to show that he was not very accustomed to it. It is said that this is the place where naval officers hold the most banquets, but Zhenren seemed to have no chance, because he wanted to bring Jianfu to the best place, so he chose this place.</p>
<p>"Are you tired? Don't you want to take a bath?"</p>
<p>Zhenren said this as he walked through a room like a guest room. "No, although taking a bath is important, talking is more important." "Oh, well then, perhaps a little earlier, but could we have dinner brought over?"</p>
<p>Zhenren ordered the maid to say this.</p>
<p>"I'm really grateful to you for bringing me to such a beautiful place."</p>
<p>Takao changed from sitting on his knees in the Japanese style to sitting cross-legged, saying this.</p>
<p>"Because it's to celebrate for you! Today is really wonderful! Talking about the Naval Minister's Award, it even adds a lot of glory to me. Your father must be very happy too."</p>
<p>Zhenren said this very happily.</p>
<p>"Easy, easy. Therefore, I want to take this opportunity to go home and take a look."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see! It's just like the meaning of returning home in glory."</p>
<p>"It's not that yet! I plan to go home to apologize for running away."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's not right to worry your parents. I also want to go home this autumn to see my mother."</p>
<p>Zhenren said these words, which were a natural outpouring of missing his parents.</p>
<p>The maid brought the wine and dishes. Indeed, they were top-quality dishes.</p>
<p>"I haven't been drinking lately. How about you?"</p>
<p>Zhenren covered his glass with his hand, saying this.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"No, it's not good..."</p>
<p>Although Zhenren did not clearly state the reason, Takao deeply felt Zhenren's solemn attitude and did not urge him to drink.</p>
<p>"When you go back to your hometown, there will definitely be many surprising things! — Miss Eda must have grown up too."</p>
<p>Zhenren still used a kind tone, saying this with a slight smile. He had seen the father and Miss Eda of the woman in labor when the warship "Isuzu" was in Kagoshima Port, but Takao had not seen his family for exactly six years since he left home.</p>
<p>"Most likely! She's already twenty years old."</p>
<p>Takao smacked his lips with emotion and sipped his wine glass, suddenly saying again</p>
<p>"Oh, I remembered. I almost forgot about showing Zhenren the photo of the painting." (117)</p>
<h3>The Children's Library Book Collection Ends Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Children's Library's book collection has been enthusiastically supported by all walks of life, exceeding the expected target of 300,000 yuan. As of recently, a total of 351,831 yuan has been raised, including 43,400 yuan from Mr. Fang Zi, 30,000 yuan from Mr. Shi Zhifu, and 20,000 yuan from Pang Laiyu. The fundraising will end today (the 15th). It is hoped that those who have not yet submitted their donations will do so at the library as soon as possible. In addition, the new books added to the library this time have been cataloged and displayed in batches in the main and branch libraries, welcoming children to read them.</p>
<p>Medical Consultation and Medicine Dispensing</p>
<p>National doctor Cao Ximan has set up a clinic at No. 8 Weiqing Lane, at the intersection of Datong Road and Shanhai Pass Road (telephone 38666). He has been providing free medical consultations and medicine dispensing every summer and autumn for several years. He is now scheduled to start free consultations immediately. The extremely poor will still be given medicine, and the medicine funds will still be assisted by Dr. Cao's relatives and friends. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM. In addition, Dr. Cao's summer outpatient hours have been changed to after 3:00 PM. In case of emergency, he can also be reached before 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>The Zhengyang Road Central Education Charity Association, in addition to providing porridge and coffins and other charitable activities throughout the year, has recently united with the Yongkang Road and Chengdu Road branches due to the soaring rice prices, so that ordinary hawkers earn little and cannot afford to feed themselves. They have jointly established a civilian canteen. In addition, as the season has entered an epidemic period, in order to facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of the sick, they have also promoted the Chengdu Road, Yangshupu, Yongkang Road, and other branch associations to hold twelve joint free medical consultations and medicine dispensing. The mobile tea dispensing vehicle has also started. Therefore, the expenses are huge, and funds are needed urgently. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who are happy to do good deeds will generously donate and contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Association, recently, because it is summer, and the general poor people suffer from diseases and have no ability to seek medical treatment, the abbots of various mountains have jointly donated huge sums of money to establish three Buddhist clinics, frequently inviting famous doctors to provide medical consultations and medicine dispensing. It is heard that the first clinic will be established soon at the Guoen Temple on Weiermeng Road. All those who are sick can go there for treatment.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Medical Clinic has always aimed to relieve poverty and disease. Recently, in view of the authorities' ban on smoking, it has printed secret recipes for quitting smoking and distributed them widely. Anyone with a smoking addiction can go to the clinic to ask for them in person or by mail, free of charge. Address: No. 12 Liucun, Jiucang Street, Nanshi. Time: 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>Asthma specialist Dr. Tang Yaoli has recently set up a branch clinic at No. 346 Weihaiwei Road, inside the Jinfashop Pharmacy, for the convenience of patients in the western district. Time: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. In the afternoon, he still sees patients at Room 502, 5th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road. Time: 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. For outpatient appointments, please call 90765.</p>
