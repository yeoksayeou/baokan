<h3 id="c1">鄉村建設 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>有清感同間，曾相鄉以書生平定太平天國之亂，轉戰東南數省，深知民間遭受兵　之苦，其與友人書云：「近年從事戎行，每駐紮之處，周歷城鄉，所見無不毀之屋，無不伐之樹，無不破之富家，無不欺之窮民，大抵受害於賊者十之七八，受害於兵者亦有二三，　然私歏行軍之害民，一至於此耶？」可知當時鄉村破壞之慘，固由於太平軍之焚掠，而官軍如湘軍·淮軍·常勝軍之軍紀蕩然，曾氏亦未嘗諱言。以是故老相傳洪楊遺事者，迄今猶不免有談虎色變之感！</p>
<p>近數年來，鄉邨承變亂之餘，人民所受痛苦，與曾氏所言相對照，則八十年前洪楊時代鄉村破壞情形，歷歷如在目前。今日戰區各鄉鎮，頗多為匪軍盤踞，胡作胡為，雖有國軍間作鎮壓之舉，但因本身素質不良，訓練未嚴，大有成事不足，敗事有餘之事實。有時國軍與匪軍勢力互為消長，往往拉鋸起仆，此生彼來，在此環境下，最為不幸者劂為當地人民，兩不討好，動輒受累。雖窮鄉僻壤，亦感鷄犬不寗，鄉村所愛慘禍，有絕非身居近代都市之人士所能想像者。</p>
<p>據來自蘇北人士言，即以目前蘇北一隅情形而論，除共產軍及少數渝軍游匪而外，僅舊揚屬高，實，興，泰，東，江，儀，七縣，及如皋泰興兩縣之一部份鄉鎮，卽駐有正規和平軍八師之眾，而地方保安自衛團隊及地墾總隊尚不中內。每月除由中央按照規定發給薪餉，復由駐在各縣每月供給若干萬作為軍事補助費。惟以軍隊過云歷史蕪雜，其素質難免良莠不齊，不肖者流，往往利用鄉保甲長，按畝派捐，叫囂勒索，有甚虎狼，近傳東台縣第二區某鎮七月份派捐一千七百萬，業主每田一畝，應繳捐三百元，雖二三畝自耕農，亦無法倖免，是全部租榖收入，以之抵償捐款尚不足！舉家生活所需，更無着落？較之過去四川防區時代預征田賦，猶有過之無不及！無怪民間童謠謂：「隊長槍桿一拍，鄉長買田起屋，保長大魚大肉，戶長號啕大哭。」此數語，實不啻區鄉村破壞情形之惟一寫照。</p>
<p>今日鄉村破壞情形旣如此，吾人以為目前侈談鄉村建設。似尚非其時，必先求如何消滅破壞鄉村之諸種因素，力謀鄉材生活之安定，然後始可從事鄉村建設。茍鄉村不安定如故，治安未能確立如故，人民身家性命無保障如故，則計劃大綱，終成紙上文章，絕難實現，其無補於鄉村建設之實際者殆可斷言。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日政府自組閣以來，對於處理重大時局之信念，更為堅定，其目的即在昂揚民氣，增强戰力，以守遂戰爭。茲二十八日定例閣議席上，杉山陸相及米內海相，曾共同宣言謂，陸海軍應團結一致，集中一切力量與施策，以達到完遂戰爭之目的，關於希望實現施策之意見，有以下各點：　政府堅定必勝信念，向完遂戰爭之途邁進。　為昂楊民氣，應特別考慮與論之明朗化。　關於增强空中戰力之萬全施策。　為期政治力之澈底滲透，應特別注意强力且簡素化之國務運營等。小磯首機等對此，均無異議，且均予贊同，並就實現之途，分別交換意見，結果決定全體一致往前邁進是。由於此次陸海兩相之發表共同宣言及內閣全體之決定一致實行，故人心為之一新，因此今後關於與論之明朗化，航空戰力之增强及國務運營之簡素化等，均須加以充分留意。</p>

<h3 id="c11">空襲生活談 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>沒有飛機的戰鬥，已成過去了。在伊姆法爾前綫，雙方正反復串演著空襲戰，當親覩壯烈的空戰情狀時，對飛機的威力，覺得於今為尤甚。而空襲是不分前綫與後方的，茲擬將印度戰綫第一綫上的幾次空襲經騐，報告後方，以為應付決戰的後方人民之一助，下面是從印度前綫寄來的防空雜記。</p>
<p>空襲神經</p>
<p>「震撼心贓的轟炸，擾亂神經的經重機槍的彈雨」。這是俘虜的白人的鐵，同著恐怖與戰傈一同叩擊敵陣的日本新銳機，盡情表現了空襲的威力。但任何大規模的空襲，因直接炸彈而受的損失，非常輕微。空襲所發出的力量，是人類的神經，即恐怖感，飽經空襲的記者，曾　得炸彈落在　中的炸裂聲，見到外部似燎原般的大火，但空襲一過，跑出去一看，殆毫無犧牲。如果設法避開，是可以避開的，這自信是絕對必要的。第一綫的將士已不把空襲當作一回事了。處以鎭靜，無論怎樣濃密的彈幕也可以避開。一天受幾次轟炸的部隊，犧牲者亦沒有一人，跟著炸聲而鍛煉起來的空襲神經，是減少損害的唯一要訣。必勝信念是使敵機無從發揮其威力的無言的高射砲。僅因空襲而滅亡的國家是沒有的。祗要鍛煉空襲神經。</p>
<p>空襲感覺</p>
<p>愈受轟炸，用心愈深，感覺敏感，有時神經更特別銳利。在不分晝夜每隔五分鐘聽到炸聲的狀況下，鳥鳴蠅翁，都當作是炸聲，飛鳥上影亦誤以為機影。體內時時刻刻有一種空襲感。但這在某時間內成為第六感而起著作用。敵機的種類與數量，目的可以知道得相當清楚。轟炸機隊的聲音，在急降下之前已經知道了。四引擎大型轟炸機在作水平轟炸時，早已避入壕中了。戰鬥機祗要一看其方向與旋回的高度，就知道其統擊的方向與企圖，而不必擔心位置等，這空襲感覺是從平常研究敵機的類型與炸彈的各類而養成的。因為空襲對策也就是訓練有素的防空訓練。</p>
<p>空襲生活</p>
<p>空襲生活是絕對不可缺的空襲要務。空襲下的生活及總準備不是一朝一夕所能完成的。前綫將士所經歷的空襲生活，多少可供後方民眾的參考，茲錄之如下：</p>
<p>關於防空壕</p>
<p>防空壕是絕對必要的，但毋須於華美而鄭重。</p>
<p>防空壕的深度祗要足夠遮沒頭部就夠。</p>
<p>取分散配置，最好是個人壕。</p>
<p>利用遮蔽物及代用品待避，注意勿震破耳膜。</p>
<p>壕須自掘，因是寄托自己生命的東西。</p>
<p>一入防空壕，就不必怕空襲了。</p>
<p>空襲時的動作</p>
<p>絕對不可動，因為即使落葉，飛機也看得很清楚。</p>
<p>不要露出白色，赤色，青色，黃色的觸目顏色，注意服裝的顏色。</p>
<p>息音，全身的注意力向著炸聲。</p>
<p>空襲時的日常生活</p>
<p>炊事從早。</p>
<p>注意水火。</p>
<p>準備衣服的替換。</p>
<p>練習黑夜的動作。</p>
<p>養成對月明之夜措置的習慣，月色很有關係。</p>
<p>不急要時，從容正確入特避所，（敵機確實　去前勿出）。</p>
<p>注意周圍情形，敵機常去而復回。</p>
<p>熟悉壕的位置，須時常作得避訓練。（翔譯自七月五日東京每日新聞）</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　中部太平洋基地電：大宮島之戰局，逐漸熾烈，戰鬥之中心為本田一帶，昭和町方面之日軍，亦向本田地方移動中。二十五日晚，日軍由本田方面總攻敵之主力，敵亦以主力抵抗，戰綫錯綜混亂，戰門極其激烈，是役，敵軍損失二千一百人。二十四日中敵之損失約為千二百人，奧洛特半島之日軍，至二十五日夕刻，擊斃敵軍六百名，敵自登陸以來至二十五日，已損失九千九百名之衆矣。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地二十八日中央社電敵機之攻擊帛琉島日形劇烈，二十六日敵機鬥轟炸機累計達三百架，反覆猛烈轟炸該鳥，當地日軍部隊舊勇迎戰，繫落敵機十一架，擊毀六架。</p>

<p>里斯本二十入日巾央社電海通社訊：華盛頓息，美國陸軍部昨晚透露，美軍在此次戰事中之傷亡數，已超過一九一七年至一九一八年之戰事，美軍在此次戰事中，投失數字約為三一三·〇〇〇人，其中包括陸軍二〇七·〇〇〇人，海軍五〇·〇〇〇人，在塞班島之損失為一六·〇〇〇人，關島三·〇〇〇人，諾曼第二四·〇〇〇人，航空人員一一·〇〇〇人。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電　據東北太平洋前綫電，東北太平洋戰綫之戰不下數十次之多，但截至四月止，即停止夜襲，利用濃霧，改向畫間空襲，同時敵軍似着着向南推進，並放棄偵察乃至神經戰之空襲，而改為大規模轟炸之空襲，此點尤足令人注目。又敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦數千艘，亦曾於六月十四日晨及二十六日午夜，分別砲擊中千烏及北千鳥，敵軍此種舉動，實可視為對中部太平洋作戰之牽制行動，同時更可謂敵軍乃圖破壞日軍基地。敵顷力言中部千烏之戰略價值，其在五六兩月之行動，實與其宣傳並無二致，尤以在五月以來，敵即利用濃霧，頻行畫間空襲，六月十五日，敵空軍曾不分晝夜，反復來襲，在中千地區，則更低飛以機槍掃射，同時出沒於該方面水域之敵潛艇，為遮斷日軍補給路，最近利用濃霧，於白晝浮出海面航行，或在距岸一千米乃至二千米之海面，以潛望鏡偵察日軍陣地，並着着採取活潑且兇狠之行動，誘導飛機作戰，凡此種種行動，亦可謂為敵軍謀取積極攻勢之左證。又六月份砲擊北方及中千島之敵艦，預料當以夏威夷為基地之艦隊一部，而阿留申島之敵兵力，似亦已於五月內集結完畢，於是東北方面之戰機，巳在濃霧期中逐次緊迫，但日軍守備部隊對緊迫戰機，確立不動之決戰態勢，足以充分應付當前之情勢。</p>

<h3 id="c27">大陸前綫　民衆協力作戰 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>本月五日發表的日本政府聲明，明白表示了目前在華巾華北展開的大陸作戰之目的，其規模之宏大，作戰山雄渾，在大陸戰史上未之前見。其作戰的性質，與以前的歷次戰役，在本質上不同。第一，去年一月對華新政策實施以後，重歸於野戰軍本來面目的中國派遺軍，在此次作戰中，明確地表現了一年半以來的本來面目。客觀上，駐渝美空軍的大陸制覇態勢捉進，或「不殲滅大陸上的日軍，不能制壓日本」，此種侵攻大陸的野心，當然使巾國大陸成為決戰塲所，以武漢攻略戰為最後一般，而對峙了五年餘戰局，此次為之改觀，轉變為完全推毀敵勢力，確立必勝態勢之純戰力的作戰階段。</p>
<p>這期間的大陸戰所表現的是以戰養戰，一方面由於國民政府的成立，而擴充其點，綫與面，以適應建設新中國的要求，削减渝方的抗戰力。以破壤敵軍需物資及破壞其經濟力為目的的出繫作戰，載斷補充路作戰；成擴大淸鄉地區，覆减擾亂和平區根據地的治安作戰，其全部政治的經濟的性質，成為作戰要求的重大耍素。</p>
<p>我們在這些戰役中，曾聲明「不以一城一市為目的」，因為我們的作戰目的，乃是「以戰養戰」，或治安作戰。然而此次作戰，其作戰行動的神速果敢，與以前含有政治的，經濟的要紊之歷次戰役，性格完全一變。</p>
<p>第二，據反軸心陣勞的推斷，大陸上日本軍事力漸告涸渴，可是日軍在大陸上依然保持着强大的兵力。從未在日軍面前露險，而企岡保存至最後的胡宗南軍，在洛陽西被澈底繫潰，又事變以來怕我痛擊而常避退主力的湯恩伯軍，完全被包圍殲減。這二者之中，無論那一件，都是大陸戰史中最高峯戰火，在潮南野戰中，賴人馬之力而一舉下長沙醴陵，也可說是大陸作戰中所稀有的事。</p>
<p>第三，這種純戰略的作戰，是極峻嚴的軍紀之顯現，派遣軍現在以作戰即行動的姿態出現於抗戰區民衆之間，將士的一舉手，一投足，成為體現同盟條約精神的試金石。</p>
<p>如聲明中所示，第一綫將士不以中國民衆為敵，而與我為友，不與英美協力者，雖渝軍亦非敵人，渲日軍的友邦愛，使一般中國民衆異常注目。中國民衆對日軍的協刀，日見濃化。</p>
<p>中國事變勃發迄今，己歷七年了。大陸作戰的變態，就種種意義而觀，將成為戰局之鍵。（譯自七月入日大陸新報）</p>

<h3 id="c39">美國的誇大數字 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>東西兩戰塲都進入決戰階段的時期，各交戰國的軍需生產數字，業已與戰局的歸趨發生了密切不可分的關係。尤其我們日本，特別要注意當前大敵美國，直接侵入日本本土的野心，以及雄視一切的美國軍需生產的動向。敵人的地大物博所構成的生產力，的確是不可輕視的。太平洋上美國由沿島作戰突改為一飛越作戰，這畢竟不能不承認敵人生產力的龐大。這也就是近代戰中不能輕視物量的一個理由。</p>
<p>古來諺語中說，「以眼還眼，以牙還牙」，這倒非常適用於近代戰中的物量戰。為抵制噴火的巨砲，則需要更大的砲。應付坦克車則以坦克車，打擊飛機則以飛機，如是方能取勝。能最深刻體騐到近代戰爭的現實性者，莫如今日。</p>
<p>然則，我們日本就無條件地懼怕美國那樣軍需生產的龐大及物量所構成的戰略麼？決不的。一九四二年六月，美國戰時生產部畏諾爾遜曾承認，美國軍需生產業已表示出「頭昏狀態」了，於是一部份論者，就猜想美國的生產力即將急轉直下，一落千丈。但後來二年多，美國生產力的直綫上騰，業已充實了反攻用的補充，而無情地粉碎了這一部份論者猜想的錯誤。</p>
<p>造成這種錯誤的原因，就是一味忽視敵國誇大宣傳的生產數字眞相。</p>
<p>自詡世界第一，以維持「自己生活樣式」為哲學的近代美國人民，驅使之於長期戰的最有力方法，無非是用之不盡取之不竭的物量作祟。羅斯福黨徒努力向國內外宣傳本國生產力的主要原因，就在此。但自從開戰以來，每次發表建造的商船噸數時，總是避免實數，而用虛數，其中約誇大百分之二十五。</p>
<p>一九四四年度美國建造商船目標，為虛數二千萬噸，但實數為一千五百二十萬噸。這在外行人看來，的確覺着是驚人龐大的數字。又於今年六月二十七日，美國戰時生產局發表了更正的軍需生產指數。仔細想吧！美國業已更正生產指數三次了。第一次的更正，是在開戰後一年半，是把一九三九年九月作百分之百標準的指數，改為以一九四一年十一月為百分之百了。為具體硏究一下更正的情形，則必須檢討一下第一次標準的內容。如以坦克東為例，第二次歐戰前夕美國坦克車生產量，每月不出百輛。重坦克車的生產量，每年不過數輛，這一點大家都知道，曾遭雜誌報章激烈攻擊政府不準備作戰的有力口實。一九三九年九月的標準改正為一九四一年十一月的標準時，縱令一九四一年度的坦克車生產量提高了百分之五十，但這樣坦克車的生產量也算不了龐大。發表說是提高了百分之五十，但按實在生產量說，還不能談到增加。因此美國的軍需生產力之「龐大性」，只是限於文字上的宣傳。</p>
<p>第二次又更正了軍需生產的內容。這就是說，除掉生產落後的軍需品目，而形式上加强了指數全體的影饗。此次是以一九四三年十二月的平均額為標準的。這樣一來，就無法正確把握生產實數了。更正在公式面上公開進行，於是使大衆墜入五里霧中，不容許有絲毫的懷疑。但在這裹邊，充斥着美國政府當局煞費苦心的欺騙。</p>
<p>美國統計學書上的序文　差不多都毫無例外地刋佈着下列有趣的標語：「人類的謊言，是不能永久不揭穿的，但數字往往是不能揭穿的」。美國宜傳的主體，在於宣揚物量，同時在宜傳背後，在玩弄着「數學的麾術」。敵方宣傳的目的，是以誇示本國物量的龐大，而粉碎對方的士氣。令對方驚嘆「已方無論怎樣生產，也不能趕上敵人」，這就是美國的企圍。</p>
<p>缺少物量的精神主義，固然危險，但忽略精神的物量主義，更是危險。我們所最迫切者，是對敵八的正確認識，如眞能這樣，則不會發生「輕敵」的現象，也不會發生「懼敵」的現象。（安譯自七月九日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3 id="c55">舊八區電車的調整問題 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 京</p>
<p>據報載，舊八區電車亦將考慮減少行車數量和廢除某一路綫。當然我們希望在可能範圍內仍能顧及乘客的便利。因此，普遍照現存各路車輛減少百分之三十是不經濟的；隨意廢除某一路綫也不一定是合理的。我們以為還得根據這樣的原則來處理：廢除重複的路站，在一條路上只有一種路綫的電車行駛，酌量縮短路程，增加車輛運動次數，根據這一原則，茲擬一具體變更辦法如下：</p>
<p>廢除有軌電車之第一，二，七，三綫,保存第十路，另開一新綫由泰山路靈寶路至徐家匯。</p>
<p>理由：現在一，二，七，三路綫大抵重複，且路程較長，在非辦公時間內泰山路上電車往往首尾銜接，行駛如牛步，且乘客稀少，今將三路倂為一路，車輛可用現在三路總數之半或略多，擁擠現象可不致十分嚴重。十路因對舊八區東，南區居民出入影響頗鉅，且為進出廠必經的路綫，故可以保持原状。</p>
<p>廢除無軌電車之十八路，而十七路及二十四路仍難維持原狀。</p>
<p>理由：十七，十八，兩路綫大抵重複，十八路所經路程中，為十七路所不經過的只有順昌路長興路到斜橋的一小段。而十七路由順昌路長興路至打浦橋，是較長的一段。故廢除十七路，居民不受影響，倘廢除十七路，則將有大批居民感受不便，而且南市　門現已普遍開放，斜橋已經不是重要的出入孔道了。至於二十四路之不能廢，眾所共曉，不待多言。</p>
<p>二十二路公共汽車倘能維持，應分為兩段，一段由徐家匯到洛陽路象山路，另一段由黃浦灘開始，到大世界後，不比折入　夏路，仍由大上海路一直向西，到洛陽路華山路為重點。</p>
<p>理由：二十二路現存路綫太長，而乘客不一定都乘長程。後一段如將路綫拉直（不經　夏路及西臨安路）而向西延長，則實際所長有限，卻可補救七路廢除後對西區往來的不便。因為二十二路過去因英，法租界綫關係，不得不繞圈子，現在這　界綫根本已不存在，舊英商公共汽車也已停駛，當然可以讓法商汽車在大上海路行駛，省去不必要的周折。更因為目前二十二路車輛很多，分段後也不致令人感覺太少。</p>
<p>當然，無論如何，今後乘客的擁擠仍是不可避免的。因此，除希望鄭重處電車輛的減少及路綫的廢除外，還希望法商電車公司也實行排隊乘車的辦法。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>血與淚（六）</p>
<p>一九二四年四十三號潛水艇，一九三九年伊字六十三號潛水艇，一九遇難時艇員的決心與態度，都是非常鎮靜，而足為後世效法的。「其中也有在潛艇中，而就不能浮出了，我相信當時全體艇員的態度，都是典型的軍人視死如歸態度，這一點的理由，讓我下面講，總之，四十三號潛水艇遇難的場合，全體艇員都略事前知道的。」上較這樣繼續說下去。</p>
<p>四十三號潛水艇的遇難，是該年三月十九日早晨，在佐世保海外演習時，與軍艦龍田號發生撞碰而起的。潛望鏡被撞斷，由司令塔附近浸入進去水，在瞬息間，竟沉沒於海底。與沉沒同時，曾放出救命孚標，所以救護隊也知道艇的所在，而能用電話聯絡。這就是說，艇內會有活人。但這並非全部，立到就曉得了。潛水艇一沉沒，各處的屏障立刻關閉，所以各艇員被遮斷各處，但在電話裏聽到的聲音，是穴見上士，電動機室的小川機員上尉，市村樣關中尉以下十七名活著。他們在遇難同時，曾用電話打聽發令所處艇長心得桑島上尉等人的安范，但並沒有任何回答。其實，當時艇長等人，業已殉職了。雖然如此，海底來的電話，報告着艇內狀況，同時還不斷打聽「艇長和先任將救平安麼？」同時入電動機室，呼吸困難起來，而在喘聲裏仍然不斷打聽艇長的安全。</p>
<p>老實說，電話這樣機器自從發明以來，像這樣悲壯痛絕的通話，這尚屬第一次。一刻一刻的死神在迫近着，最後高呼「天皇陛下萬歲！」之聲，喘聲在電話裏聽不見了，而終於淹死了。四十三號潛水艇的沉沒地點，正是潮流最激烈的地方，打撈艦體，會費了一個多月。後來便發現電動機室十八名外，水電雷室和臨時室內的生存者，曾有十四人。他們每一個人都在衣　裏放着遺囑。電動機室小川上尉等，也各有遺囑留下。鬼塚上士的遺囑，是爲了愛子能讓，所以是用正楷字姆寫的。其中穴見上士的遺書，是長篇大論，不僅把沉沒的經過有詳細的記載，而且對於賢妻愛子也都叮囑了不少話。遺書上說，妻改嫁也可以。</p>
<p>離開家時，我早已知道死之將至了。再沒有什麽未完的心思了。南無阿彌陀佛亞門！</p>
<p>上士甚至這樣開了一個玩笑。（一二五）</p>
<h3 id="c65">敵美人力枯竭　國內窘態畢露　松島部長發表談話 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，昨日（二十八日）循例在海軍武官府招待中國記者團發表談話，茲摘錄其重要各點於左：</p>
<p>美國人力瀕於枯竭</p>
<p>美國近在東西兩　作戰，人力損失數字　為龐大，尤其在太平洋作戰上，因數字過鉅，美軍當局極力掩飾發表。根據美國過去發表損書的數字之不一致，前後矛盾以觀，可知美國內部衷心的苦悶。頃據可靠方面情報，現在美國機動預備兵力，僅有三師團餘，關於在馬利亞納戰綫方面，美將轉用　作戰之師以補充之。由於塞班和作戰日軍神勇的犧牲給予敵方重大損害，迫使敵軍出血作戰，達到日軍理想目的，遂使敵軍愈前進，而日軍形勢愈有利。據本月廿五日新德里電，羅斯福總統鑒於太平洋戰局迫切，對增加二十萬之現役軍人案，已予簽署執行。於此消息反面觀之，可知美國太平洋作戰之損失，以至不能不以二十萬人力去補充的程度　在前次報道會議上一　提及敵在塞班損失人力當在十萬以上，於今可得一證實，又據六月二十二日美國海軍部發表，海軍，陸戰隊，及海岸警備隊　力　開戰以來人力損失數字計戰死二乙〇〇六人，行蹤不明九五二二人。被俘四四六九人，總計四九五七五名。又尼米　發表塞班作戰美國兵力損失約一萬五千名左右。綜合此類數字再與羅斯福簽署補充二十萬人力提案觀之，殊堪玩味，明眼人自能深窺其重點何在矣。</p>
<p>渝方人力將被利用尼米資曾大聲呼喊須至中國大陸對日作戰，其用意在利用中國人的資源最近華萊士歸國亦力言有此必要，彼得以為只有以美國兵器，驅使中國人民對日作戰否則美兵犧牲後無人補充。尼采資在吉爾貝特　島作戰後，即主張甚力。最近尼米資深恐此種論調，將遭華人反感，已略改變主張謂縱到達中國大陸，將以海上作戰代替陸戰蓋期避免華人不滿之故從另一方面觀察美國戰況，表面似在　進展，其實敵已受日軍巧妙作戰誘致，繼續作戰代價之出血，吾人深信「物　萬能」，行見美國將人力資源枯竭下一蹶不振，遭受敗績。</p>
<p>美禁家屬與兵通信</p>
<p>美軍在塞班島登陸後，　廣播發表，禁止在美之士兵家屬，與作戰之士兵通信，並禁止一切可覘知其勢態迫切嚴重，逐日緊迫</p>
<p>美人目的奴役東亞</p>
<p>此次華萊士旅行回國，曾發表其所謂旅行感想謂：美國人之生活方式，是最好的方式，在其旅行所經過之各國人士，均對美國生活方式表示景慕。同時又謂：戰後可利用美國資材，和亞洲資源，而求美國的繁榮，將來亞洲的發展，一定要包含在美國西海岸之內。於此可知美國作戰之目的實在奴役全亞洲人民。決不似宋子文.孔祥熙.宋美齡等所心儀已久之美滿目的。</p>
<p>卑視中日一成習慣性</p>
<p>最近美國在華空軍有被俘虜者，其中一名於大學畢業後經過六個月之訓練即派來華，在昆明桂林等地受訓，彼於被俘後，態度極為傲慢，有人詢之對中國人之印象如何，答曰：在世界上決無一民族像中國民族之劣勢，又詢其對日本人之印象如何，彼謂當然與華人一樣。再問其對中國女人之感想何似，彼謂最初見之印象已不佳，經交際之後，印象更壞。最近某日余路過江灣路，曾目觀一趣事，特為諸君述之。是日有兩車裝載美軍俘虜與菲軍俘虜，行徑江灣路時，見有日本婦女數人迎面而來，前車菲俘虜向日婦女示意歡迎，後車美俘虜則佯然不睬，側目而過。兩車再向前行遇中國婦孺數名於道左，菲俘虜仍　如故，美俘虜則以煙蒂投向該婦孺之中。在此兩段事實上看來，可知美人卑視中日人民心理，已成習性。聽說上海有一部份中國人仍在殷望美人到來，此種事實，可供這般人士參考</p>
<p>德新兵器嚇倒美人</p>
<p>德國近在東綫已使用一種新兵器，V1之流星彈及V2之一人乘魚　，其詳細名稱現尚未悉。毀壞力之大，美英為之胆寒。美國宣傳部長對於新兵器均布　表驚異，惟對於德國此一新兵器，聞當展視其構造與戰力之後，彼之心臟為該項新兵器嚇停一分鐘之久云。</p>
<h3 id="c66">日本「改造」「中央公論」　二大雜誌停刊 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>在日本出版界中有悠久歷史的中央公論社並改造社，依本年三月的企業整備令，而改刊為綜合雜誌及時局雜誌的「改造」。但最近該兩社的營業方針中，在國民的思想指導上，有難於默許的事實，情報局乃毅然申告兩社自動停刊。十日午後三時，情報局橋本第二部長召見中央公論社長山本寶彥氏，告以此意，兩社均諒解此旨，自動停刊。中央公論社於明治二十年誕生為反省會雜誌，三十三年起，刊行中央公論，昭和四年，迎現社長島中氏，五十九年來雄視於出版界，以至今日。現在該社發行的雜誌有「中央公論」「圖解科學」二種，均已停刊。改造社創立於大正八年，改造雜誌於本年六月停刊，「短歌研究」，「　局研究」二雜誌今後亦將停刊。因該二社的停業，結果，綜合雜誌殘存者僅「現代」與「公論」二種。（譯自七月十一日每日新聞）</p>

<p>本局於上年七月二十二日開始舉辦本市强制勞動保險，迄今恰為一年，茲特將一年來辦理經過情形，分述於後：</p>
<p>投保人數</p>
<p>社會保險，依據社會保險暫行大綱規定，原分為强制勞動保險及一般職業者保險二種。前者經規定：凡工廠礦塲或從事含有危險性及有礙衛生工作之被雇者，皆為强制勞動保險之被保險人，後者以從事同一事業之從業員或同一機關同一團體服務之職員為被保險人。本局成立後，當以上海市為全國工商業薈萃之區，故特先行在本市舉辦强制勞動保險，於七月二十二日通吿，各工廠並派員分別勸導投保，承本市產業界曁各有關機關及各同業公會從旁協助，一年來投保工廠達二〇六五家，被保險人有五七七六四人。茲將業別投保廠數及被保險人人數，統計如下：</p>
<p>（註）其他項下，包括製鞋，製　，汽燈，木器，米粉，陶磁，錫箔，賽璐路，彈花，牙刷，餅饅，成衣，奶粉，皮鞋，製盒，電焊，据木，扳箱，儀器，油漆，酒精，調味，熱水瓶，金屬綫絲，榨油等三十餘業，因各該業投保人數未滿百人，故不分列。</p>
<p>保費收入</p>
<p>至於保險費率，除三輪車駕駛人及人力車夫因工作性質特殊，另有規定外；一般工廠之强制勞動保險，係根據被保險人標準報酬，由業主負責繳納十分之五十之保險費，一年來收入保險費，總數為四二四四六〇入元。茲將各工廠被保險人逐月累計數，保險費收入及每一被保險人平均負擔分別統計如左：</p>
<p>給付支出</p>
<p>業主對保險人，（本局）的負擔是保險費的繳納，而保險人對被保險人的負擔却有三種：第一是保險給付費，第二是醫療設施費，第三是業務維持費。保險費收入及每一被保險人平均負擔已如上述，現在分別說明保險人對被保險人的負擔：</p>
<p>甲，保險給付　所謂保險給付，便是本局對被保險人因執行業務而發生保險事故（如傷害，疾病，殘廢，死亡，及女工生產等，）經濟上蒙受損害時之補助而言。一年來支出數字統計如下：（千元以下不計入）</p>
<p>給付名錄　金額</p>
<p>實際醫療一，〇六九千元</p>
<p>疾病津貼　二一四千元</p>
<p>傷病津貼　二一六千元</p>
<p>生產津貼　一八五千元</p>
<p>殘廢津貼　一〇三千元</p>
<p>喪葬費　一一二千元</p>
<p>遺族䘏金　一三八千元</p>
<p>合計　二，〇三七千元</p>
<p>乙，醫療設施　醫療設施費係指本局謀被保險人健康之增進，醫療上之特種設施費用而言，與前項保險給付中之實際醫療情形不同，所包括者如保健指導，醫療器具，重要藥品及診療設備等是，一年來支出數字為一〇〇〇五九八元。</p>
<p>丙，業務維持費　包括有關業務方面之必要開支，如業務員薪津，印刷紙張契約調查等等費用，一年來支出數字為一，五〇三，〇五二元。</p>
<p>三項合計為四，五四〇，三一二元，超出全年保險費收入總數三十萬元。平均每月支出為三七入，三五九元，根據上述統計數字，保險給付佔百分之四十五，醫療設施費佔百分之二十二，業務維持費佔百分之三十三。</p>
<p>特種保險</p>
<p>本市三輪車駛駕人及人力車夫社會保險，因其情形特殊，爰另行分別組織業務委員會專責處理，一年來辦理經過如次：</p>
<p>（甲）投保人數三輪專駕駛人社會保險被保險人為七一六〇人，人力車夫社會保險被保險人為三五七七七人。（均為本年六月底前之累計數。）</p>
<p>（乙）保險費及牧入三輪車駕駛人及人力車夫因工作性質特殊，其所得報酬與一般工廠工人之標準報酬不同。故三輪車駕駛人社會保險保險費之征收，係以出差次數計算，每差征收保險費初為三角，近改五角。自去年十月起至本年六月底止，收入保險費總數為一，一三二，五〇五元。平均每月為一二四，三六一元。每一被保險人每月平均負擔僅一入元左右。人力車夫保險費，則根據每輛車出班次數計算，平均為每一輛人力車每月征收保險費四十二元，自去年十一月起至本年六月底止，收入總數為二，〇四四，一四入元。平均每月收入為二五五，五一八元。每一被保險人每月平均負擔亦僅二〇元左右。</p>
<p>（丙）對被保險人負擔三輪車駕駛人及人力車夫兩業務委員會一年支出分類總計如下：（千元以下不計入）　　　保健實施</p>
<p>社會保險目的在增進國民健康，安定勞工生活，被保險人遇有意外事故發生時，本局除予以實際醫療外，並給予各種津貼，給付情形，已如前述；唯醫療設施，不僅為被保險人治病而巳，且在積極方面謀健康之增進，茲將一年來保健工作實施情形，說明如下：</p>
<p>（甲）特約醫院本局為實施保健工作，除直接設置醫務室及第一第二第三診療所外，並遴選市用設備完善之醫院聘為特約醫院，計有同德（各科）南洋（各科）怡和（外科）大德（各科）樂仁（各科）滬東（各科）普安（各科）瞿直甫（各科）偉光（各科）東南（各科）生生（內科產科）大端（各科）光華眼科（眼科）市立南市滬西浦東各醫院及高橋等醫院。</p>
<p>（乙）巡迥診療　為謀勞工健康並對疾病防患於未然，特設置巡迥診療車組織巡迥診療隊，按日分赴各工廠巡迥診療，除對被保險人疾病發生隨時診療外，對於各工廠衛生設備之改善，工人健康之增進等均予以詳細指示，並按照季節時令實施各種預防注射及種痘。</p>
<p>（丙）診治疾病人數　一年來包括本局醫務室，第一，第二，第三診療所，巡迥診療隊，各特約醫院，對被保險人診治疾病人數統計如下：</p>
<p>（內科方面）感冒六四一二人。氣管枝炎七六八四人。胃腸病一〇三五人。風濕關節痛七二三人。神經衰弱三一五人。瘧疾一一三二人。傷寒三五人。羊癲瘋二人。肺結核九二一人。肋膜炎一二一人。脚氣病二四一人。痛風一八人。矢眼一二人。肺炎二一人。腸結核一二人。登革熱二人。關節炎七五人。</p>
<p>（外科方面）業務上受傷六七七二人。下肢潰傷五一四三人。瘡節三二一六人。濕診一三八九人。凍瘡五二四人。疥癬五三〇人。骨膜炎八人。骨癆六人。燙傷六九一人。痔瘡三四五人。蜂窠織炎三二人。盲腸炎二八人。瘤一二人。丹毒一〇人。</p>
<p>（眼科方面）砂眼二一〇〇人。結膜炎三二四人。角膜炎一〇二人。眼肌麻痺四一六人。眼肌麻粒腫三一六人。眼網膜炎二一入人。角膜異物五〇一人。眼角外傷六九人。眼部外傷四人。</p>
<p>（耳鼻喉科方面）耳炎三一四人·喉痛一二四人。鼻炎九九人。扁桃綫炎二人。齒痛四一人。腦綫炎二一人。其他疾病淋病五人。尿道炎一四人。種疽二人。</p>
<p>預防往射及種痘三〇九六人。淋巴綫炎二人。梅毒二〇人。</p>
<p>附言</p>
<p>本局一年來工作大槪情形，已如右述。檢查在此短時期內，投保工廠實已佔全市二分之一强，顧所保工人數則僅佔一般估計之三十分之一，殊引為憾；惟念社會保險在我國是一種新創事業，故舉辦之初，工廠業王能深明瞭及信任者甚鮮，如紗廠業工廠，初時來局投保者寥寥，且所報工人有以多報少情事，迨款及數月，見本局對該業勞工發生保險事故時所担負給付數字，確實至鉅，尤其對於死亡工人之喪葬費遺族卹金等，能迅速照數賠償，因而非僅大部份工廠紛紛前來投保，即對於未投保工人亦前來補具加保手續，倘能假以時日，樹立規範，必能收獲預期之目的。尙冀產業界凜此戰事時期，安定勞工生活為增强社會國家力量之先決條件，社會保險實為針對現實需要的必要措施，繼續協力推進，俾此種事業得是遍展開。</p>
<p>罰鍰</p>
<p>勞働保險為什麼要實行强制？這裏有一個現成的譬喻：便是注射防疫針為了要求州得到普遍的防疫質効，就非厲行强制不可。勞働保險也是一樣，為了要謀勞工生活的警遍安定，所以要用法律來加以强制。</p>
<p>因此對於拒絕為其被雇者投保强制勞動保險的工廠，就得訂定罰鍰規則來處罰。現在社會羅利部訂定的强制勞慟保險罰鍰規則分為兩部份：第一對於拒絕投保的工廠處一萬元以下的罰金；第二對於逾期不繳保險費的工廠按照欠費日數及應繳金額百分比處以罰金·至於各工廠中請投保人數及標準報酬與實際不符經查明屬實者依照虛報差額加倍處罰。社會保險暫行大綱第九條規定罰鍰由保險局裁定通吿後逾十日抗不繳納者即可函請警務機關或法院執行的。經過處罰的工廠，仍舊要投保或繳費。</p>
<h3 id="c70">社會保險局　週年紀念 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>社會福利部社會保險局成立以來，業巳一載，該局為使各界明瞭推行社會保險現狀起見，將定於今（二十九）日下午五時假泰興路醫都花園舉行週年紀念會，並茶會招待本市各界領袖曁各投保工廠業主，屆時社會福利部丁默邨氏將親臨致訓，該局並特將一年來社會保險實施狀况，繪成圖表，撮製照片，共計五十餘種，陳列會塲，公開展覽。</p>
<p>（一）投保工廠以機械業為最多，棉織業跟絲織業次之。</p>
<p>（二）上年度被保險人每人每月平均負擔是三五元五角，而所享受到的：保險給付是一八元，醫療設施費是九元，業務維持費是十二元，一共是三十九元，換句話說社會保險局對每一個被保險人每月耍負擔三元五角的支出。</p>
<p>（三）據統計因執行業務而受傷的平均十人中有一人。</p>
<h3 id="c71">小統計 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>（四）業務維持費係指業務員薪給，契約調查，印刷紙餵，徵收及其他事務費用而言，十一個月共支一百五十萬元，平均每月不過十三萬元五千元，而每一個被保險人每月負擔亦不過十元。但聞該局第一個月所支出的業務維持費，每一被保險人要負擔六十五元光景，現在則為七元，恰成十與一之比。所以投保人數愈多，被保險人對業務維持費負擔也愈少。</p>
<p>（五）保險給付項下，實際醫療費用佔二分之一强，其他津貼則以疾病及傷疾為最多。實際醫療部份據記錄，有一工人會因病享受到三萬入千元以上的給付。最近平均每個就診人，須支付七十元光景的醫療費，最初不過二十元，最近需要一百十元，因為醫藥材料也眼着一般物價上漲的原故。</p>
<p>（六）人力車夫死亡率平均每星期死二人。</p>
<p>（七）鐵工廠工人，人力車夫及輪車駕駛員，平均每十人中有四人患下肢潰瘍。</p>
<h3 id="c72">標準報酬計算法 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>一，查社會保險暫行大綱第七條及投保申請書所稱之標準報酬者，係指勞工以勞力獲得之一切報酬而言。强制勞動保險即根據此標準報酬以為保險費計算之基礎。如被保險人遇有疾病津貼，傷病津貼，分娩津貼，殘廢津貼，遺族恤金等事故時，亦根據標準報酬以為保險給付計算之基礎。</p>
<p>二，標準報酬分工資，津貼，其他，總數等四項，茲將其含義逐一說明如下：</p>
<p>工資　指事業上之受雇人為業主工作所得之薪水俸金而言。</p>
<p>津貼　指受雇人為業主工作險薪水俸金外所得之津貼，例如米貼房貼及生活津貼等。</p>
<p>其他　指受雇人為業主工作險上述一二兩項外所得之報酬，例如廠方供給膳貪者，則將膳費折合金額，列入本項內、至於膳食折合，暫作八百元計算</p>
<p>總數　指受雇人為業主工作取得之工資津貼及其他（如供膳之折合金）報酬之總金額而言。</p>
<p>三，標準報酬以按月計算為原則。按年計算薪者為年薪十二分之一。按日計　者為日薪之三十倍。如以每小時計算薪，按件計薪或收入不定者，按標準報酬決定日前九十日之問所獲得之總共收人按三分之一計算之。</p>
<p>四，被保險者如有標準報酬計算困難或計算不當等情形，保險局得按適當方法計算標準報酬。如：</p>
<p>標準報酬即每月之平均收入。應按實際情形算定之。例如按第三條計算標準報酬時，如此規定期間恰因特殊事故或因病停工多日者，則所計算得之標準報酬數額必失之過低，應以實際工作日數計算方稱公允。</p>
<p>如係按日計薪而實際每月工作不足三十日者，亦應按實際情形計算之。</p>
<p>如有季節關係之業務，在某一時期內收入特別增多或減少者，得由保險局參照實情辦理。</p>
<p>五，被保險人同時有一個以上之識業時，應以各個職業所得報酬合併計算之。</p>
<p>六，關於膳費折算之解釋：</p>
<p>根據一般投保人所塡保險人之標準報酬，不供膳者平均都在一千元以上，而供膳者孝在二百元以下，且有維持五年以前之工資者，此在金額上之計算，前者顯較後者為多，實際上後者轉較前者為優，對於保險費之徵收，倘僅依金額計算，後者固較前者少，但其享受之保險給付，除實際醫療外，其他如傷害津貼疾病津貼等，亦比例計算，受虧者仍屬被保險人，此種情形，理應將其膳食所得折合金額，併入計算。</p>
<p>膳費折合，係根據物價估値，目下普通膳費，如完全為配給米，另加燃料蔬菜費，每人兩餐，每月約須千人以上，倘以包飯作所定價格而論，則須每客三千元以上，為減輕保險費之繳納、姑一律以入元計算。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Rural Construction <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi reigns of the Qing dynasty, Zeng Guofan quelled the Taiping Rebellion as a scholar-general, fighting across several southeastern provinces. He deeply understood the suffering of the people due to war. In a letter to a friend, he wrote: "In recent years, I have been engaged in military affairs, and wherever I have been stationed, I have traveled through cities and villages. Everywhere I see houses destroyed, trees felled, wealthy families ruined, and poor people oppressed. In general, seven or eight out of ten suffer from the rebels, and two or three suffer from the soldiers. I secretly lament that the harm of military operations to the people has reached such a point!" This shows how devastating the destruction of rural areas was at that time, partly due to the burning and looting by the Taiping army, but also because the discipline of the official armies like the Xiang Army, Huai Army, and Ever Victorious Army was non-existent. Zeng Guofan never shied away from speaking about this. Therefore, the elders who pass down stories of the Hong-Yang era still cannot help but feel fear!</p>
<p>In recent years, the suffering of the people in the villages and rural areas after the chaos is comparable to what Zeng Guofan described. The destruction of the villages during the Hong-Yang era eighty years ago seems to be happening right now. Today, many towns and villages in the war zones are occupied by bandit armies, acting recklessly and lawlessly. Although there are occasional suppression efforts by the National Army, due to their poor quality and inadequate training, they are more likely to do more harm than good. Sometimes, the power of the National Army and the bandit armies rise and fall, often in a tug-of-war. In this environment, the most unfortunate are the local people, who please neither side and are often implicated. Even remote villages are in turmoil, and the suffering of the villages is unimaginable to those living in modern cities.</p>
<p>According to people from northern Jiangsu, even considering the current situation in northern Jiangsu alone, apart from the Communist army and a few remnant bandits of the Yu army, only the seven counties of the former Yangzhou prefecture – Gaoyou, Rugao, Xinghua, Taizhou, Dongtai, Jiangdu, and Yizheng – and parts of Rugao and Taixing counties are stationed with a regular Peace Preservation Army of eight divisions. Local security and self-defense teams and land reclamation corps are not included. In addition to the salaries paid monthly by the central government according to regulations, the counties where they are stationed also provide several tens of thousands of yuan monthly as military subsidies. However, because the history of these troops is complicated and their quality is uneven, unscrupulous elements often use the village chiefs and heads of household to levy donations based on the acreage of land, extorting money with threats, more ferocious than tigers and wolves. It is rumored that a certain town in the second district of Dongtai County levied 17 million yuan in donations in July. Landowners had to pay 300 yuan per mu of land. Even self-cultivating farmers with only two or three mu could not escape. The entire income from rent and grain was not enough to cover the donations! How could they possibly provide for their families? This is even worse than the pre-collection of land taxes during the defense zone era in Sichuan in the past! No wonder there is a folk rhyme that says: "The team leader slams his gun, the village chief buys land and builds houses, the neighborhood chief feasts on big fish and meat, and the head of household wails loudly." These few words are a true reflection of the destruction in the villages.</p>
<p>Given the current state of destruction in the villages, we believe that discussing rural construction at this time is premature. First, we must find ways to eliminate the various factors that destroy the villages and strive to stabilize the lives of the villagers. Only then can we engage in rural construction. If the villages remain unstable, if law and order cannot be established, and if the lives and property of the people are not protected, then the grand plans will become mere words on paper and will be difficult to implement. It can be said with certainty that they will not contribute to the actual construction of the villages.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – Since the formation of the cabinet, the Japanese government's belief in dealing with the major current situation has become even more firm. Its purpose is to boost morale and increase war power to complete the war. At the routine cabinet meeting on the 28th, Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai jointly declared that the army and navy should unite as one, concentrate all efforts and measures to achieve the goal of completing the war. The following points were raised regarding the measures they hoped to implement: The government must firmly believe in victory and move towards the path of completing the war. To boost morale, special consideration should be given to clarifying public opinion. Implement comprehensive measures to increase air combat power. To thoroughly penetrate political power, special attention should be paid to the strong and streamlined operation of state affairs. Prime Minister Koiso and others had no objections and agreed with these points, exchanging views on how to implement them. As a result, they decided to move forward unanimously. Due to the joint declaration by the army and navy ministers and the unanimous decision by the entire cabinet, the people's hearts have been renewed. Therefore, full attention must be paid to clarifying public opinion, enhancing air combat power, and streamlining the operation of state affairs in the future.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – The ambassador of Manchukuo to China, Lu, returned to the country on official business and arrived in Xinjing on the 26th. On the 27th, he paid his respects to the imperial palace and visited relevant agencies. At 5:00 PM that evening, he met with a group of reporters at his official residence and said: The Chinese government and people are extremely concerned about the current state of the war. Because of the emergence of the new Japanese cabinet, they are increasingly convinced that Japan's victory is not far off, and the people's hearts are very stable. When reporters asked about the impact of the frequent reports of Japanese victories in central and southern China on the people, the ambassador replied that the Japanese government would issue a statement saying that Japan's enemies were the British and Americans who invaded East Asia, and certainly not the good Chinese people. He also instructed the soldiers to strictly observe military discipline and not to violate the slightest thing when the Japanese army passed by, which was welcomed by the people. What the Chinese people were even more grateful for was that when they built roads and transported military supplies, the people were very happy to help.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Troops Occupy Fengshui on Both Banks of the Lianjiang River, and American Aircraft Drop Bombs on Chongqing Positions <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>A certain Japanese base on the front lines, 28th (Central News Agency) – The encirclement and annihilation battle launched by the Japanese army against the Chongqing army's 156th and 159th divisions on both banks of the Lianjiang River has become increasingly fierce. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing dropped many bombs on the Chongqing army's positions during this battle, causing many casualties to the Chongqing army. When the Japanese army opened fire on the Chongqing army near Fengshui and Huanshan on the 13th of this month, several squadrons of British Air Force P51 aircraft stationed in Chongqing flew in from the northwest and dropped bombs like rain from high altitude. However, the bombs all exploded within the Chongqing army's positions, causing the Chongqing army's newly equipped bunkers to be filled with black smoke, and their officers and soldiers shared the same fate as the bunkers. Seeing this situation, the Japanese army thought the opportunity had come and immediately broke into the Chongqing positions, and Fengshui and Huanshan were occupied by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Uses Proper Tactics</p>
<p>A certain Japanese front line in Hunan, 28th (Central News Agency) – The fall of Hengyang, the forward base of the Chongqing and American Air Force, is only a matter of time. The Chongqing side falsely claims that the Japanese army is using poison gas to cover up its defeat. According to Chongqing prisoners, American poison gas experts came to Guilin at the beginning of this year to train the Chongqing army to use poison gas. It was used in Liling on May 24 this year. The 54th Division of the Chongqing army and other units that attempted to defend Hengyang Airport also used it. The Japanese army suffered considerable damage due to the use of poison gas by the American and Chongqing armies, but in order to protect humanity, they have always adopted proper combat tactics and will never engage in chemical warfare.</p>

<p>Suzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) – August 1 is the anniversary of the recovery of the Shanghai concession. The Provincial Government Affairs Office aims to make the whole people thoroughly recognize the sincere assistance of our ally, Japan, and the national government has designated this day as Restoration Day. Furthermore, at the time of the decisive battle in the Greater East Asia War, we should intensify our efforts to strive for final victory.

<h3 id="e11">Talking About Life During Air Raids <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Battles without airplanes have become a thing of the past. On the Imphal front, both sides are repeatedly staging air raids. When I witnessed the heroic air combat, I felt that the power of airplanes was even greater today. Air raids do not distinguish between the front and the rear. Now I plan to report several air raid experiences on the Indian front line to the rear, so that it can help the people in the rear to cope with the decisive battle. The following is a record of air defense from the Indian front line.</p>
<p>Air Raid Nerves</p>
<p>"Heart-shaking bombing, nerve-wracking heavy machine gun fire." This is how the captive white soldiers describe the power of the new Japanese planes that pound the enemy lines with terror and shuddering. But any large-scale air raid causes very little damage from direct bombs. The power of an air raid is directed at human nerves, at the sense of terror. A reporter who has experienced many air raids has heard the sound of bombs exploding nearby, and seen the raging fire outside, but after the air raid is over, he runs out and finds almost no casualties. If you find a way to avoid them, you can avoid them. This confidence is absolutely necessary. The soldiers on the front line no longer take air raids seriously. If you are calm, you can avoid even the densest barrage of fire. A unit that is bombed several times a day does not have a single casualty. Sharpening your air raid nerves, honed by the sound of bombs, is the only way to reduce damage. The belief in victory is a silent anti-aircraft gun that prevents enemy planes from exerting their power. No country has ever perished because of air raids alone. Just sharpen your air raid nerves.</p>
<p>Air Raid Senses</p>
<p>The more you are bombed, the deeper you think, the more sensitive you become. Sometimes your nerves are especially sharp. When you hear the sound of bombs every five minutes, day and night, you take bird calls and fly buzzing as the sound of bombs, and the shadow of flying birds as the shadow of planes. There is a sense of air raid in your body at all times. But at certain times, this becomes a sixth sense and comes into play. You can know the type and number of enemy planes, and their purpose, fairly clearly. You already know the sound of the bomber squadron before it dives. When large four-engine bombers are conducting horizontal bombing, you are already hiding in a trench. You only need to look at the direction and turning height of the fighter plane to know its direction and intention, and you do not have to worry about the location. This air raid sense is cultivated by usually studying the type of enemy planes and the types of bombs. Because air raid countermeasures are well-trained air defense training.</p>
<p>Air Raid Life</p>
<p>Air raid life is an absolutely indispensable part of air raid duty. Living in the air raid and making complete preparations cannot be accomplished in a day or two. The air raid life experienced by the soldiers on the front line can be used as a reference for the people in the rear. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Regarding Air Raid Shelters</p>
<p>Air raid shelters are absolutely necessary, but they do not need to be beautiful and formal.</p>
<p>The depth of an air raid shelter only needs to be enough to cover your head.</p>
<p>Use a dispersed configuration, preferably individual trenches.</p>
<p>Use shelters and substitutes for protection, and be careful not to rupture your eardrums.</p>
<p>The trenches must be dug by yourself, because they are where you entrust your life.</p>
<p>Once you enter an air raid shelter, you don't have to be afraid of air raids.</p>
<p>Actions During an Air Raid</p>
<p>Absolutely do not move, because even a fallen leaf can be seen very clearly by the plane.</p>
<p>Do not expose conspicuous colors such as white, red, blue, and yellow. Pay attention to the color of your clothing.</p>
<p>Be silent, and focus all your attention on the sound of the bomb.</p>
<p>Daily Life During an Air Raid</p>
<p>Cook early.</p>
<p>Pay attention to water and fire.</p>
<p>Prepare a change of clothes.</p>
<p>Practice moving in the dark.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of taking measures on moonlit nights. Moonlight is very important.</p>
<p>Enter the shelter calmly and correctly when not urgently needed (do not come out before the enemy plane is really gone).</p>
<p>Pay attention to the surrounding situation. Enemy planes often go and return.</p>
<p>Be familiar with the location of the trenches and do shelter training often. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, July 5)</p>

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Central Pacific base: The battle situation on Omiya Island is gradually becoming fierce. The center of the battle is around Honda. Japanese troops in the Showamachi area are also moving towards Honda. On the night of the 25th, the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the enemy's main force from Honda. The enemy also resisted with its main force, and the battle lines were mixed and chaotic, and the fighting was extremely fierce. In this battle, the enemy forces lost 2,100 men. On the 24th, the enemy's losses were approximately 1,200 men. As of the evening of the 25th, the Japanese army on the Olrot Peninsula had killed 600 enemy soldiers. Since landing, the enemy has lost a total of 9,900 men as of the 25th.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, 28th (Central News Agency) – Enemy aircraft attacks on Palau Island are becoming more intense. On the 26th, a total of 300 enemy fighters and bombers repeatedly bombed the island violently. The local Japanese troops bravely fought back, shooting down eleven enemy aircraft and destroying six.</p>
<p>The Number of American Casualties Exceeds That of the Last World War</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the US Department of the Army revealed last night that the number of American casualties in this war has exceeded that of the war from 1917 to 1918. The number of American casualties in this war is approximately 313,000, including 207,000 in the army, 50,000 in the navy, 16,000 on Saipan, 3,000 on Guam, 24,000 in Normandy, and 11,000 in the air force.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Pearl Harbor, the US Southwest Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 27th that the losses suffered by the US military since the start of the landing operation in Tinian until the 25th are as follows: 159 killed in action, 441 wounded, and 32 missing, for a total of 632.</p>
<h3 id="e13">The Situation on the Northeast Pacific Line is Becoming Increasingly Tense, and the Japanese Army Has Established a Decisive Battle Posture <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from the northeastern Pacific front, there have been dozens of battles on the northeastern Pacific line. However, as of April, night attacks have ceased, and daytime air raids are conducted using heavy fog. At the same time, the enemy seems to be steadily advancing south, abandoning reconnaissance and even psychological warfare air raids, and switching to large-scale bombing air raids. This is particularly noteworthy. In addition, enemy cruisers and destroyers have also shelled Nakachishima and Kitachishima on the morning of June 14 and the midnight of the 26th, respectively. This action by the enemy can be seen as a diversionary tactic against operations in the central Pacific, and at the same time, it can be said that the enemy is trying to destroy the Japanese base. The enemy has been emphasizing the strategic value of Nakachishima, and its actions in May and June are consistent with its propaganda. In May, the enemy frequently conducted daytime air raids using heavy fog. On June 15, the enemy air force launched repeated attacks day and night, and in the Nakachi area, they even flew low to strafe with machine guns. At the same time, enemy submarines lurking in the waters in that area are trying to cut off the Japanese supply route. Recently, they have been using heavy fog to surface and navigate during the day, or use periscopes to scout Japanese positions from 1,000 to 2,000 meters offshore. They are also actively and fiercely trying to induce aircraft to fight. All of these actions can be seen as evidence that the enemy is seeking an active offensive. It is expected that the enemy ships that shelled the northern and central Kuril Islands in June were part of the fleet based in Hawaii, and the enemy forces on the Aleutian Islands seem to have completed their gathering in May. Thus, the battle situation in the northeast is gradually becoming tense during the foggy season, but the Japanese garrison has established a firm decisive battle posture to fully cope with the current situation.</p>
<h3 id="e14">The Manchukuo Forestry Corporation Will Be Established in Mid-August <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Xinjing, 28th (Central News Agency) – Manchukuo passed the Outline of Special Measures for Urgent Increase in Forestry Products on the 27th. According to the outline, the main goal is to urgently increase the production of forest products and gather the overall strength of the government and people to increase the production of agricultural products in order to ensure the required amount. Therefore, in addition to formulating the Forestry Products Control Law, the Manchukuo Forestry Corporation will be newly established to specialize in the control of production, processing, and distribution of forest products under its jurisdiction. This Forestry Corporation will be established in mid-August, and the Wang Forestry Products Control Law is also planned to be promulgated soon.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Actively Mining Underground Resources in Mengjiang; Production Results Will Become Even Better <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 20th - Central News Agency - To comply with the urgent demands of the war situation, the Mengjiang authorities have decided to actively increase the production of underground resources. It is planned to launch a major production increase campaign at the Longyan Iron Mine in early August. At the same time, the old Huayuan Coal Mine will be closed and its materials, facilities, and labor will be transferred to the Datong Coal Mine. The installation of all facilities is expected to be completed by the end of August. After the Huayuan Coal Mine's facilities are moved to the Datong Coal Mine, the increased output this year is expected to increase by about 50%. In the future, when necessary, small and medium-sized enterprises will also be reorganized and transferred to the production of key resources.</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou, 20th - Central News Agency - The development of underground resources in Mengjiang is aimed at meeting wartime needs.</p>
<p>Iron Ore</p>
<p>and coal mines are the focus of mining. In order to complete the huge production increase plan for this year, in addition to concentrating the overall strength of the government and the people, all difficulties such as labor shortages in development and production increase are overcome. The results are quite promising. Taking coal mines as an example, according to reports from various coal mines, their coal mining conditions are very good. In the future, due to progress in labor countermeasures, their production performance will be even better. Among them, the Datong Coal Mine, the main coal production area, has a production increase target of several million tons this year, breaking past records. The production situation since April has been better than last year.</p>
<p>Labor</p>
<p>Due to the improvement of labor management and the activity of the Diligence Corps, labor efficiency has increased, and the allocation of materials is superior, so the production increase plan can be achieved as scheduled. In addition, special companies, such as the Daqingshan Coal Mine, are currently reorganizing their internal structure and engaging in expanding production facilities. It seems that active labor countermeasures will be implemented soon to complete the production increase target for this year. The production increase at other places such as Huayuan Coal Mine is gradually progressing, and efforts are currently being made to thoroughly solve the labor problem. Next, regarding the iron ore, which is the key point for the development of underground resources, the Longyan Iron Mine has been fully excavated, but it is to complete this year's</p>
<p>Production Increase</p>
<p>the biggest task of the plan. Since the beginning of this year, Longyan Iron Mine has implemented planned countermeasures for transportation and materials. In terms of transportation, the extension project of the dedicated railway has been completed, thereby strengthening transportation capacity. In terms of materials, in addition to striving to ensure the necessary quantity, emphasis is placed on exerting the efficiency of application materials and existing equipment. In the allocation of labor, in accordance with the various countermeasures implemented by the authorities, attention is paid to improving labor management, preventing mobility, increasing efficiency, and utilizing labor, and establishing contact between the Iron Mountain and nearby rural areas to solve the labor problem. The rest of the ironmaking sector, based on the</p>
<p>Enterprise</p>
<p>The highest level of management currently established by the company seeks to ensure raw materials and change the technical and health-related specific measures in order to achieve increased steel production. In practicing this year's steel production increase target, Mengjiang pays great attention to the labor force in mining work. In addition to iron and coal, the recent development status of various other underground resources, except for a very small portion, has achieved more than 100% results, maintaining a good record. Regarding the development and production increase of underground resources, its basic departments, such as</p>
<p>Investigation</p>
<p>The cause is unusually important. This year, it was decided to carry out a large-scale survey of underground resources. Since the beginning of this year, surveys have been conducted separately.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Adjusting Rural Labor, Allocating Chemical Fertilizers, Japan Central Cooperation Council Continues Discussions <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th - Central News Agency - On the 27th, the fifth day of the Japan Central Cooperation Council's sectoral meetings, the Sixth and Seventh Committees were held. The issues discussed by the Sixth Committee were labor, farmland, and the adjustment of agriculture and industry. The Seventh Committee focused on issues such as fertilizers and feed. The chairman of the Sixth Committee was Mr. Kohei Kenichi. After the meeting, regarding the plan to adjust rural labor, it was proposed that joint operations should be strengthened and the town and village chiefs should be responsible for managing labor affairs. In addition, women's labor should be fully utilized, and nurseries should be set up to make it easier for women to participate in labor. It was also suggested that women should engage in half-day (six hours) farming, and that women should be planned and assigned to other labor sites. Regarding this point, the government also expressed its approval and issued opinions. Yoshida, the planning section chief of the Mobilization Department of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, once said: This point has been discussed with the Ministry of Munitions, and a decision has been made to convert the current labor allocation. This point is particularly noteworthy. Regarding the appropriate allocation of current labor, the Japanese government will formulate a system of limited essential personnel centered on the Ministry of Munitions, which will be implemented by the middle of this month at the latest. It goes without saying that this system focuses on industry, and will also clearly stipulate the minimum labor standards in various aspects such as agriculture, forestry, and fishery, so not only the current labor allocation problem, but also future labor mobilization plans can be used for assistance. The Seventh Committee was chaired by Mr. Homi, and the central issue of the meeting was fertilizer feed. In order to promote the appropriate distribution of chemical fertilizers, when popularizing livestock farmers, silk fertilizer and forage should be widely planted, and a comprehensive production plan should be established. The government paid attention to listening to opinions on this issue. Mr. Kato Haruji proposed that agricultural machinery is the weapon of farmers, and shovels, sickles, etc. should be smoothly allocated. Secondly, it is hoped that the iron and steel supplied by the rural areas will be quickly repaired and returned to manufacture agricultural implements, and the requisition should be prevented. The council members expressed their opinions sincerely.</p>

<p>Yangon, 28th - Central News Agency - Myanmar Minister of Materials Supply Dakin Diton, on the occasion of the first anniversary of Myanmar's independence "August 1st," spent a week inspecting the situation in Myanmar in detail. He has now completed the inspection and returned here. According to him, the current situation of the vigorous Myanmar youth movement across the country is as follows: The people of Myanmar are now firmly convinced that final victory is coming soon. The determination to fight to the end and win, and new awareness, are now rising across Myanmar, especially among the youth. This awareness is the awareness of taking up arms and fighting alongside the Japanese army to overthrow the British. War is not only a war of money, but also a war of fields, villages, towns, cities, and factories. The cornerstones of these activities are the National Service Corps of various institutions and the East Asia Youth League. These two are now working together and are active together, but the current war situation requires even closer cooperation. Therefore, a new plan to concretize activities is being carried out step by step. In a word, I am confident that through the efforts of organized Myanmar youth, Myanmar will work with Japan to complete the war and contribute to the construction of a new order in Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e27">The People on the Mainland Front Cooperate in Combat <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The statement issued by the Japanese government on the 5th of this month clearly stated the purpose of the mainland operation currently being carried out in North China, with its grand scale and vigorous operation, which has never been seen before in the history of mainland warfare. The nature of the operation is essentially different from previous battles. First, since the implementation of the new China policy in January last year, the China Expeditionary Army, which has returned to its original form of a field army, has clearly demonstrated its original face for a year and a half in this operation. Objectively, the mainland domination posture of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been captured, or "Japan cannot be suppressed without annihilating the Japanese army on the mainland." This kind of ambition to invade the mainland naturally made the Chinese mainland a decisive battleground. The Wuhan strategy battle was the last general battle, and the situation of confrontation for more than five years was changed this time, and it was transformed into a pure combat operation stage to completely destroy the enemy's power and establish a winning posture.</p>
<p>The mainland war during this period was characterized by supporting the war with the war, on the one hand, expanding its points, lines, and surfaces due to the establishment of the National Government, in order to meet the requirements of building a new China and reducing the anti-Japanese forces of the Chongqing side. Out of the series of operations aimed at destroying the enemy's military supplies and destroying its economic power, the operation to cut off the supply road; to expand the Qingxiang area and reduce the security operations that disturb the base of the peaceful area, its entire political and economic nature has become a major element of the operation's requirements.</p>
<p>In these battles, we have declared "not to aim at one city or one town," because our operational goal is "to support the war with war" or security operations. However, the speed and decisiveness of this operation's operational actions have completely changed its character from previous battles containing political and economic elements.</p>
<p>Second, according to the judgment of the anti-Axis camp, the Japanese military power on the mainland is gradually exhausted, but the Japanese army still maintains a strong military force on the mainland. The Hu Zongnan army, which has never been exposed to the Japanese army and tried to preserve itself until the end, was thoroughly crushed west of Luoyang. The Tang Enbo army, which has been avoiding the main force due to my painful blows since the Incident, was completely surrounded and annihilated. Either of these two is the highest peak of battle in the history of the mainland war. In the Hunan field battle, it can be said that it is rare in the mainland operation to take Changsha and Liling in one fell swoop with the power of relying on human and horse power.</p>
<p>Third, this kind of pure strategic operation is a manifestation of extremely strict military discipline. The expeditionary army is now appearing among the people in the anti-Japanese war zone in the posture of acting in battle. The every move of the soldiers has become a touchstone for embodying the spirit of the alliance treaty.</p>
<p>As shown in the statement, the soldiers on the front line do not regard the Chinese people as enemies, but as friends. Those who do not cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army, are not enemies. The love of the Japanese army for the allies makes the general Chinese people pay great attention. The Chinese people's cooperation with the Japanese army is becoming more and more concentrated.</p>
<p>Seven years have passed since the outbreak of the China Incident. The metamorphosis of the mainland operation will become the key to the war situation in various senses. (Translated from the July 7th Mainland New Daily)</p>

<p>Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German News Agency, military information, said that the German army in Bialystok, located about 75 kilometers from Warsaw, was abandoned on Wednesday evening. There are still major battles in the Bialystok area. The German army retreated several kilometers to prevent the Soviet army from breaking through this point.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German military authorities announced on the 28th: The German army has left Brest-Litovsk.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th - Central News Agency - The Soviet Army's Vistula River crossing battle is underway. According to a Reuters report from Moscow, the Soviet army is attempting to cross the river 30 miles west of Robertlin with a large number of amphibious vehicles. The Soviet artillery also concentrated artillery fire to attack the German positions on the west bank. At the same time, due to the German withdrawal from Bialystok, the Soviet army has advanced to the west of Kosno to Bialystok, forming a semi-circular formation surrounding East Prussia, putting heavy pressure on the German positions east of the East Prussian border. The Soviet army north of Tvinsker is attacking Tallinn on the north coast of Estonia from Rudoyarisiknei and Narva on the Latvian border, in an attempt to cut off the German positions, but the German army in that direction is still securing the main defensive line.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - German News Agency News: The focus of the war is still in the Limburg Robertlin area. After the Soviet army crossed the Sen River at several strongholds, it apparently aimed to advance to the Vistula River, but in the past 24 hours, the enemy has not made much progress in the area. In other areas of the front line, there have been no important changes between Brest-Litovsk and Lake Pskov. A detachment of Soviet tank formations has arrived in the Ponievic district, and the purpose of their attack is obviously aimed at the West Oria area. The retreat from Narva is orderly. The reason why the German army abandoned Narva is that the town is located in a salient on the front line and is of little use to the German army. The new front line is about 45 kilometers west of the town.</p>

<p>Moscow, 28th - Central News Agency - The Soviet government and the Polish Committee of National Liberation signed an agreement at the Kremlin on the 27th, the terms of which are as follows: Within the old Polish territory belonging to the war zone, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army shall have the supreme authority. Within the old Polish territory occupied by the Soviet Army, the Polish Committee of National Liberation may establish Polish administrative organs in accordance with the Polish Constitution (but since the Soviet government declared the West Bug River as the Soviet-Polish border, the Polish administrative organs must be established west of the river). After the end of the military operations, the Polish Committee of National Liberation shall have full authority over civil affairs. The Soviet troops in Polish territory shall still be under the command of the Soviet military command, and the Polish armed personnel shall be under the command of the Polish Committee of National Liberation. The above provisions shall also apply to people outside the war zone.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News: The British believe that Prime Minister Mikolajczyk's visit to Moscow is the last opportunity for Soviet-Polish compromise. Those with keen eyes in Poland do not believe that Mikolajczyk can return to England from Moscow and have the Moscow authorities recognize the existing organization of the Polish government in exile. The Soviet Union may not receive Mikolajczyk as the head of government.</p>

<p>Vichy, 20th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News: American diplomatic activities in Madrid seem to have begun a new stage. This new act begins with the sudden departure of Donovan, the leader of American covert activities, for London. This sudden change of address can be seen as the end of Donovan's work in Spain. Colleagues close to Donovan and those with close ties to the Algiers Committee have recently frequented the American Embassy here, and it will probably take several days to determine the reason for Donovan's early departure from Madrid.</p>

<p>Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - The German military authorities announced on the 27th: The US First Army has launched an offensive in the Sangro area. The German army is also very active in this counterattack. A powerful American tank unit attempted to break through the German defensive positions between Koman and Sangro east of Sangro. Although a small salient was formed in the German positions, the German army crushed several American tank units and restored the original positions. The battle is still continuing. After large-scale bombing by the US military in the area between Vilt and Middle West of Sangro, it has finally broken through the German positions and advanced towards the Sangro-Courtensé railway, occupying Canigi. On the morning of the 27th, the US military attacked German on the Chinlo-Yerche highway, and another attack force advanced to Marini, attacking the 100 Highland west of Kurshi. The American offensive was supported by powerful artillery and a large number of bomber and fighter squadrons, but the German army has already begun a counter-offensive, which is quite smooth.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th - Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency News, the anti-Axis forces have advanced several kilometers west of Sangro and occupied the village of Marini in the southwest. The American tank team is advancing towards Courtensé.

<h3 id="e34">German Generals Who Participated in the Rebellion <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to an official announcement last night: Generals Olbricht, Beck, and Hoepner participated in the July 20th rebellion. Olbricht was executed by firing squad after being tried by a military court. Former Chief of the General Staff, General Beck, committed suicide after being arrested. General Hoepner has been arrested and awaits trial.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports that among the three generals involved in the assassination attempt on the German leader, only former Chief of Staff General Beck was well-known to the German public. He was dismissed on October 31, 1938. On the evening of the 20th of this month, he committed suicide by gunshot after seeing the assassination fail. Although the rebels designated Beck as the head of civil administration, the actual person in charge was Infantry General Olbricht. He had obstructed various important decisions. He was an army general who served as a division commander in the Polish campaign. At the time of the rebellion, he was the Deputy Commander of the Home Army, and was therefore able to use military institutions to issue false orders to the army. He was executed by firing squad that night, at the age of only fifty-six. General Hoepner was dismissed at the end of 1941 after retreating on the Eastern Front. During the First World War, all three generals served in the General Staff. During the Polish campaign, General Hoepner served as the commander of a tank column, and in the French campaign, he served as the commander of the 16th Army Corps, which included tanks and motorized units.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital: Argentine Foreign Minister General Bertier broadcast to the nation on the 26th, which is generally considered Argentina's response to the recent statement by US Secretary of State Hull. The main points are as follows: Argentina's fundamental national policies are to protect sovereignty and maintain solidarity with the Americas. Protecting sovereignty is different from isolation. On the one hand, Argentina will undertake all tasks to maintain solidarity with the Americas. Although it is now waiting for the United States to show a true attitude, Argentina has no reason to listen to the claims of other countries other than opposing the Axis powers. Argentina's special measures against the Axis powers are: severing communications with Japan and Germany; preventing espionage; blocking Axis communications and propaganda agencies; eliminating secret radio stations; imprisoning the crew of the German pocket battleship "Graf Spee," which was scuttled off Montevideo; supporting the Americas in participating in Pan-American plans; allowing non-belligerent privileges to countries opposing the Axis powers; and prohibiting Axis nationals from entering Argentina. The four policies for assisting countries opposing the Axis powers are: supplying the United States with necessary raw materials; reorganizing the Argentine merchant fleet to meet the urgent needs of the United States; severing economic ties with the Axis powers; and freezing Axis funds.</p>

<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports that the resistance put up by German forces during their disengagement operations has slowed down the British and American advance in Italy. Reports from German reconnaissance planes over the Mediterranean show that British and American forces have concentrated a large fleet in the Western Mediterranean, including giant transports and landing craft. In addition, British forces have concentrated several divisions in the Tyrrhenian coastal area, indicating that British and American forces intend to land in the Genoa and La Spezia areas of northern Italy, according to their initial plans. The focus of the British and American offensive remains south of Florence, where fierce fighting is taking place on both sides of the highway leading from Poggi Bonzi and Montevarchi to Florence. The German defensive positions are entirely guarded by smaller rearguard units. The increased pressure from the British forces again met with strong German resistance on Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Exaggerated Figures from the United States <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>As both the Eastern and Western battlefields enter decisive stages, the munitions production figures of the various belligerent countries have become closely and inextricably linked to the outcome of the war. In particular, we in Japan must pay special attention to the ambition of the great enemy, the United States, to directly invade the Japanese mainland, as well as the movements of America's overwhelmingly large munitions production. The productive capacity constituted by the enemy's vast land and resources is indeed not to be underestimated. The United States' sudden change from island-hopping warfare to leapfrogging warfare in the Pacific cannot but be acknowledged as a result of the enemy's vast productive capacity. This is one reason why the quantity of material cannot be underestimated in modern warfare.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." This is very applicable to material warfare in modern times. To counter fiery cannons, larger cannons are needed. To deal with tanks, use tanks. To strike at aircraft, use aircraft. Only in this way can victory be achieved. No one can experience the reality of modern warfare more deeply than we do today.</p>
<p>However, should we in Japan unconditionally fear the magnitude of American munitions production and the strategy constituted by the quantity of material? Certainly not. In June 1942, US War Production Board Chairman Nelson admitted that the US munitions industry had shown a state of "dizziness." As a result, some commentators speculated that US productive capacity would decline sharply and fall precipitously. However, the steady rise in US productive capacity over the subsequent two years and more has replenished the counter-offensive and ruthlessly shattered the errors of these commentators' speculations.</p>
<p>The reason for this error is that they have blindly ignored the truth behind the enemy's exaggerated production figures.</p>
<p>The most effective way to drive the modern American people, who pride themselves on being number one in the world and whose philosophy is to maintain their "way of life," into a long-term war is to rely on an inexhaustible supply of material. The main reason why the Roosevelt administration is working hard to promote the country's productive capacity at home and abroad is precisely this. However, since the start of the war, they have always avoided using real numbers and used false numbers when announcing the number of merchant ships built each time, exaggerating by about 25%.</p>
<p>The target for US merchant ship construction in 1944 was a fictitious 20 million tons, but the actual figure was 15.2 million tons. To the layman, this certainly seems like an astonishingly large number. Furthermore, on June 27 of this year, the US War Production Board released a revised munitions production index. Think carefully! The United States has already revised the production index three times. The first revision was one and a half years after the start of the war, changing the index that took September 1939 as 100% to taking November 1941 as 100%. To specifically study the revision, it is necessary to examine the content of the first standard. Taking tanks as an example, before the Second European War, the US tank production was no more than a hundred vehicles per month. The production of heavy tanks was no more than a few vehicles per year. Everyone knows this, and it has been a powerful excuse for magazines and newspapers to fiercely attack the government for not preparing for war. When the September 1939 standard was revised to the November 1941 standard, even if the tank production in 1941 was increased by 50%, this tank production cannot be considered huge. It was announced that it was increased by 50%, but in terms of actual production, it cannot be said to have increased. Therefore, the "vastness" of American munitions production capacity is only limited to written propaganda.</p>
<p>The second time, the content of munitions production was revised again. That is to say, the munitions items with lagging production were removed, and the impact of the entire index was strengthened in form. This time, the average amount in December 1943 was used as the standard. In this way, it is impossible to accurately grasp the actual production figures. The revision was carried out publicly in the formula, thus plunging the public into a fog and not allowing the slightest suspicion. But within this, there is a lot of painstaking deception by the US government.</p>
<p>The prefaces to American statistical books almost all contain the following interesting slogan without exception: "Human lies cannot be hidden forever, but numbers often cannot be revealed." The main point of American propaganda lies in promoting the quantity of material, while playing "mathematical magic" behind the propaganda. The purpose of the enemy's propaganda is to exaggerate the magnitude of its own quantity of material and shatter the morale of the other side, making the other side exclaim, "No matter how much we produce, we cannot catch up with the enemy." This is the American plot.</p>
<p>A spiritualism that lacks material is certainly dangerous, but a materialism that ignores the spirit is even more dangerous. What we most urgently need is a correct understanding of the enemy. If we can really do this, then there will be no "underestimating the enemy" phenomenon, nor will there be any "fearing the enemy" phenomenon. (Translated by An from the July 9 Yomiuri Hochi)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Youth Cadre School, in order to cultivate cadres for the Youth Corps and to improve the organization of the Youth Corps in the city, specially selected cadres of all levels from the Municipal Corps authorities at the beginning of this month and implemented training at the Shanghai University College in Jiangwan, Shanghai. The training subjects are divided into spiritual education, military training, and ideological training. They also focused on training in the necessary academics and skills for training young people, as well as labor services to cultivate the spirit of hard work and endurance of all students. Since the beginning of school, the graduation period has arrived yesterday. Therefore, a grand graduation ceremony was held at 9:00 am. Mayor Chen personally attended the inspection and delivered a speech. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Situation</p>
<p>Mayor Chen arrived at the grand ceremony on time. In addition to Mr. Xiao Peiwen, the deputy director of the school, other senior officials from the city who attended included Liu Yangshan, the chairman of the Municipal Party Committee, Lin Jiongan, the director of the Education Bureau, Lu Qi, the director of the Administrative Division of the Municipal Police Bureau, Zhao Zhengping, the president of Shanghai University (represented by Zhao Ruheng), Xu Tian, the director of the Economic Bureau, and dozens of Chinese and foreign guests. More than one hundred members of the First Regiment and the First District Corps of the Municipal Youth Corps also participated in the ceremony. The atmosphere was warm and the ceremony was very grand. The inspection ceremony began at 9:30. Under the command of Wu Pengfei, the captain of the team, all the students were agile and spirited. After the mayor and other senior officials inspected the field for a week, the passing-out parade began in the symphony of military music. The posture was heroic, the steps were neat, and the procession circled the field for a week before it was completed. The graduation ceremony began at 10:00. After all the attendees saluted, Mayor Chen delivered a speech in a sad and encouraging tone. The student representatives gave a reply. The China Film Company filmed a newsreel on the spot, and the ceremony ended at 11:00 am, followed by a photograph and adjournment.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's speech stated: "The promotion of the New Citizen Movement and the organization and training of young people are major issues in seeking national revitalization and construction. Since the establishment of the Republic of China more than 30 years ago, we have been talking about construction and revitalization almost every day. Until today, we have not been able to achieve our ideal goals. The main reason is that the people have failed to be organized and trained, and that national education has failed to be popularized. Although China truly has 400 million people and a vast territory, because national education has not been popularized, it is difficult to start organizing and training the people. Since the people have no organization and training, the people's minds are scattered, and the discipline is lost. The impact is that the country is declining and society is chaotic. The people are the elements that constitute the country. If the people are not united, how can they express their strength? They are already shaken in peacetime, and they feel difficult to cope with during the period of changing times. If we want to seek national wealth and strength in this way, wouldn't it be very difficult? On the contrary, even if a poor country, all the people, if there is organization and discipline, will be able to gradually become wealthy and strong from poverty. Therefore, if we want to seek revitalization and construction today, we can only organize the people and train the people, especially starting with organizing and training young people, and organizing and training ourselves, to be the example for the people and the model for young people. Only then can we make every citizen have a deep national concept and a selfless spirit. The main points of organizing and training young people and promoting the New Movement are here. I hope that after you students return, do not neglect this point, take the lead, practice the New Movement, and work hard to organize and train young people, so that we can gradually complete the great cause of national revitalization and construction."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Stamp Tax Bureau Designates Seven Distributors <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau believes that the purchase and posting of stamps by merchants and residents in the Shanghai urban area has become increasingly popular and complied with the law. Therefore, in recent months, those who purchased stamp tax tickets have been very enthusiastic. In order to prevent crowding and facilitate merchants and residents to purchase stamps, the bureau has specially designated seven salt shops as special stamp consignment points. In the future, merchants and residents can purchase stamps from the designated consignment points nearby. If the price is raised above the face value or handling fees are charged, they can report it to the bureau or the tax inspection department for punishment. The names and addresses of the seven special stamp consignment points are as follows: ① Yongdahe (524 Hankou Road) ② Yingfengxin (29 Dongxinqiao Street) ③ Xiexichangxiang (1249 Huashan Road) ④ Laoganfeng (1175 Xinzha Road) ⑤ Jinchangtai (34 South Huangpu Road) ⑥ Baochang (461 Changxing Road) ⑦ Zhaochang (9 Yiling Road, Xia Road).</p>

<p>Huazhong Water and Electricity Company, because the water purification chemicals for tap water are mostly supplied by Japan, and the water delivery requires a large amount of electricity. Transportation is becoming increasingly difficult. In this decisive period, tap water must be further saved. Therefore, a tap water saving campaign is being implemented. It is hoped that users will not exceed 80% of their water consumption in June of this year in order to save water. The outline of water saving methods has been stipulated: Users are asked to strictly follow the guidelines: ① Tighten the faucets. ② The toilet should stop flowing water after use. ③ Do not use excessive water and do not use it for alcohol. ④ Do not release as much water as possible when washing clothes. ⑤ Fire-fighting water needs to be retained for a long time, but to avoid direct sunlight, it must be covered with a wooden lid. You can put small fish in the bucket to prevent the stored water from rotting. ⑥ If the faucet or toilet is damaged or leaking, it should be repaired as soon as possible. The organization of the inspection team will go to various places to inspect at any time, and users can make the most of it.</p>

<p>Since the official establishment of the Industry and Commerce Enterprise Investigation Committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in February of this year, it has spared no effort in promoting the investigation and statistics of Shanghai's corporate enterprises. Therefore, the results are very satisfactory. After the various statistical figures of the association were published in the newspapers a month ago, the economic community paid great attention to them. The reporter visited the person in charge of the association to understand the recent work of the association. "Since the establishment of the association, we have started the investigation of the contents of various companies of enterprises, real estate and listed stocks. We adopted an indirect method to distribute the forms to the respective companies to arouse the interest of the industrial and commercial circles in the investigation and fill them out automatically. Since the forms were distributed, most of them were able to fill them out and send them back. Only the real estate industry has not yet been completed. Now we have sorted out the received forms separately and initially counted the regular work, and compiled the industrial and commercial trend report on a monthly basis for the ministry's reference twice a month. The statistics on the establishment and capital increase of industrial and commercial enterprises in the first quarter of this year have been completed, and the statistical figures have been published in the newspapers in summary. Now the second quarter (summer) will also be completed and can be published for reference by all sectors. In addition, the investigation of the capital increase of various companies, etc., is designated by the ministry to be handled, and the investigation of many companies has been completed and reported separately. In the future, in addition to regular investigation and statistics, this association intends to study and analyze the data obtained and formulate countermeasures for the competent authorities to adopt and implement."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Branch, located within the Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, houses prisoners who have not yet been judged by the court or who are appealing their sentences. According to the branch chief, Hui Erfu, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the current hot weather makes prisoners in the detention centers more susceptible to disease. The branch currently holds approximately 600 to 700 prisoners, with about 40 to 50 suffering from illness. It is imperative to treat the sick promptly to prevent the spread of infection to other prisoners. However, due to limited funds, the branch relies on Mr. Hui's efforts to solicit medical supplies from outside sources, which have been largely successful. Various sectors have donated restorative agents, heart tonics, and various special injections. However, because the quantity used is so large, especially during this summer season when the number of patients increases, the center earnestly hopes for generous donations from charitable individuals from all walks of life.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Adjustment Problem of the Old Eight District Trolley Cars <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>According to reports, the old eight district trolley cars are also considering reducing the number of vehicles and abolishing certain routes. Of course, we hope to still consider the convenience of passengers within the realm of possibility. Therefore, a general reduction of 30% in the number of vehicles on each existing route is uneconomical; arbitrarily abolishing certain routes is also not necessarily reasonable. We believe that the following principles must still be followed in handling this: abolish redundant routes and stops, have only one route of trolley car running on a street, appropriately shorten routes, increase the frequency of vehicle movement. Based on this principle, we propose a specific modification plan as follows:</p>
<p>Abolish tram routes No. 1, 2, 7, and 3, preserve route No. 10, and open a new route from Taishan Road Lingbao Road to Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Reason: The current routes No. 1, 2, 7, and 3 are mostly redundant and have relatively long routes. During non-office hours, trolley cars on Taishan Road are often connected end-to-end, moving at a snail's pace, and have few passengers. Now, merging the three routes into one, the number of vehicles used can be half or slightly more than the current total number of the three routes, and congestion can be prevented from becoming too severe. Route 10 has a significant impact on the residents of the eastern and southern districts of the old eight districts, and is the only route to and from the factory, so it can maintain its original state.</p>
<p>Abolish trolleybus route No. 18, while routes No. 17 and 24 are still difficult to maintain in their original state.</p>
<p>Reason: Routes 17 and 18 are mostly redundant. The only short segment of route 18 that route 17 does not pass through is from Shunchang Road Changxing Road to Xieqiao. Route 17, on the other hand, has a longer segment from Shunchang Road Changxing Road to Dapuqiao. Therefore, abolishing route 18 will not affect residents, while abolishing route 17 will cause inconvenience to a large number of residents, and the Nan City gates have now been generally opened, and Xieqiao is no longer an important entry and exit point. As for the reason why route 24 cannot be abolished, everyone knows it and there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>If route 22 bus can be maintained, it should be divided into two sections: one section from Xujiahui to Xiangshan Road on Luoyang Road, and the other section starting from the Bund, going to the Great World, and then not turning into Yuxia Road, but continuing west along Great Shanghai Road to Huashan Road on Luoyang Road as the focal point.</p>
<p>Reason: The current route 22 is too long, and passengers do not necessarily take long trips. If the latter section is straightened (without passing through Yuxia Road and West Lin'an Road) and extended westward, the actual length increase will be limited, but it can compensate for the inconvenience caused to western district residents by the abolition of route 7. Because route 22 had to go around in circles in the past due to the British and French concession lines, now that these border lines no longer exist and the old British-owned buses have also been discontinued, French-owned buses can of course operate on Great Shanghai Road, saving unnecessary detours. Moreover, because there are currently many vehicles on route 22, it will not feel too few after being divided into sections.</p>
<p>Of course, in any case, passenger congestion will be unavoidable in the future. Therefore, in addition to hoping for careful handling of the reduction of trolley car vehicles and the abolition of routes, we also hope that the French-owned trolley car company will implement a queuing system for boarding.</p>

<p>Mr. Lu Tongyan's letter: "Respectfully, the first anniversary of the death of my late wife, Madame Cheng, on the tenth day of the sixth lunar month. I have refrained from the vulgar practice of hiring monks to perform Buddhist rituals. Considering the current difficulties facing all, the hardships in making a living, and the prevalence of epidemics during the summer season, countless poor and sick people are in pain and have no way to be saved, which causes me great distress. Therefore, I have saved 1,000 yuan from expenses to contribute to your organization's poverty relief fund, as a token of my heart. I am aware that this is a drop in the bucket and will not solve the problem, but I hope that fellow citizens in Shanghai will echo this sentiment and accumulate little by little. Moreover, with the Ghost Festival approaching, filial sons and grandchildren should save expenses for ancestral rites and contribute to helping the poor and sick, which will create boundless blessings. Even if the ancestors in the afterlife are aware, they will also feel comforted. One."</p>

<p>Qingshu Student Aid Fund, the Huzhou Shanghai Middle and Primary School, founded thirty-eight years ago, has always had free admissions. This spring, Mr. Zhang Rongchu, a fellow villager, donated funds to commemorate his esteemed father, Qing Ru Gong's enthusiasm for promoting education, entrusting the school to manage the Qingshu Student Aid Fund for enrollment and study. Since its establishment, it has benefited many fellow villagers. Mr. Zhang, also realizing that the cost of living has increased significantly, based on his original intention, has entrusted the school to continue operating the fund next semester, with a quota of one hundred students, divided into full and half fees. Students from the six counties of Huzhou who are fellow villagers in Shanghai, from impoverished families, with academic grades of 70 points or above, and conduct grades of B or above, can apply at the school within the Huzhou Association at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM daily, until August 20th.</p>
<p>Guangzhao Association Subsidy:</p>
<p>The second session of the Shanghai Guangzhao Association's subsidies for impoverished students has now begun to accept applications. Impoverished and outstanding students (academic and conduct grades both reach B or above) who are fellow villagers from the Guangzhao region and wish to apply for a subsidy can have the application form obtained by their current school, or, in special circumstances, may personally collect it at Shanghai Bank Building, 40 Guangdong Road, 5th floor.</p>
<p>Mingxin Bookkeeping Free Class:</p>
<p>Mingxin Accounting School, located at No. 18, Lane 531, Henan Road, will begin classes on September 4th. This semester, in view of the large increase in tuition fees and the large number of people unable to enroll, a bookkeeping free class has been specially set up to provide relief. The enrollment limit is temporarily set at fifty students. Classes will be held from 5:00 PM to 6:20 PM. Those who are from impoverished families and aspire to study bookkeeping may apply to the school.</p>
<p>Guangdong Fellow Association Student Aid Exam:</p>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association is organizing the third student aid event. More than 1,200 people have applied. After careful review, excluding interviews with returning students and those who failed, there are still more than 900 people. The exam is scheduled to be held on August 1st and 2nd at the Guangdong Middle School, Guangdong Primary School, and Chongde Building Girls' School. Each day begins at 8:00 AM. To ensure impartiality, leaders of the local Yue diaspora have been invited to supervise the exam.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special City First Police Bureau's Baojia Division writes: "Respectfully, your newspaper published an article by Mr. Shen Qiye on July 25th, 'The Problem of Students Standing Guard,' which stated that the Lianbao Office always assigns students from the student self-defense corps to stand guard during class time, and despite repeated requests, it is ineffective. If they go to stand guard, they will miss their studies; if they do not stand guard, they must pay 50 yuan each time, which is unaffordable, etc. After investigating, the regulations for reducing and exempting service for the first district's self-defense corps stipulate that students must serve during their spare time, which has been announced and implemented. Standing guard cannot be replaced by others, and this has also been ordered to be followed.

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Blood and Tears (6)</p>
<p>Submarine No. 43 in 1924, Submarine I-63 in 1939. The determination and attitude of the crew members when they encountered the disaster were very calm and worthy of emulation by future generations. "There were also those who were in the submarine and could not float out. I believe that the attitude of all the crew members at that time was typical of soldiers facing death as if returning home. I will explain the reasons for this below. In short, on the occasion of the disaster of Submarine No. 43, all the crew members knew about it in advance." He continued to say the above.</p>
<p>The disaster of Submarine No. 43 occurred on the morning of March 19 of that year, during an overseas exercise in Sasebo, when it collided with the warship Tatsuta. The periscope was broken, and water entered from near the conning tower, causing it to sink to the bottom of the sea in an instant. At the same time as it sank, it released a life-saving buoy, so the rescue team knew the location of the submarine and could contact it by telephone. This means that there would be living people inside the submarine. But this was not all, and it would be known immediately. As soon as the submarine sank, the barriers in all places were immediately closed, so the crew members were cut off from each other. However, the voices heard on the telephone were those of Sergeant-Major Anaumi, Lieutenant Ogawa, the engine operator in the engine room, and seventeen others including Lieutenant Kwanichi Ichimura, who were alive. At the same time as they encountered the disaster, they had used the telephone to inquire about the safety of Commander Kuwashima, the skipper, and others at the headquarters, but there was no response. In fact, at that time, the captain and others had already died. Nevertheless, the telephone from the bottom of the sea reported the condition inside the submarine, and at the same time, they kept asking, "Are the skipper and the first mate safe?" At the same time, the engine room began to have difficulty breathing, and they continued to inquire about the skipper's safety in their gasping voices.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, since the invention of the telephone, this was the first time there had been such a tragic and heart-wrenching call. Death was approaching moment by moment, and finally, the cry of "Long live the Emperor!" The gasping sound could no longer be heard on the telephone, and they finally drowned. The sinking location of Submarine No. 43 was in the place where the currents were the most rapid. It took more than a month to salvage the hull. Later, it was discovered that in addition to the eighteen people in the engine room, there were fourteen survivors in the torpedo room and the temporary room. Each of them had a will in their clothing. Lieutenant Ogawa and others in the engine room also had wills left behind. Sergeant-Major Onizuka's will was written in block letters for the sake of his beloved child, Nengrang. Among them, Sergeant-Major Anaumi's will was a long essay, not only recording the details of the sinking, but also giving many instructions to his virtuous wife and beloved child. The will stated that his wife could remarry.</p>
<p>When I left home, I already knew that death was coming. There are no more unfinished thoughts. Namu Amida Butsu!</p>
<p>The sergeant even made such a joke. (125)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Exhaustion of Enemy Manpower and Resources; Domestic Difficulties Fully Exposed; Statement by Minister Matsushima <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 28th), Colonel Matsushima, the press officer of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China, followed his usual practice of hosting a reception for the Chinese press corps at the naval attaché's office and issued a statement. Excerpts of the key points are as follows:</p>
<p>American Manpower Approaching Exhaustion</p>
<p>The United States is currently engaged in warfare on both the Eastern and Western fronts, resulting in a massive loss of manpower. Particularly in the Pacific theater, the figures are so enormous that the American military authorities are making every effort to conceal them. Judging from the inconsistencies and contradictions in the figures of past losses released by the United States, it is clear that there is deep-seated distress within the country. According to reliable sources, the United States now has only slightly more than three divisions of mobile reserve forces. Regarding the Mariana Islands battlefront, the United States will re-deploy divisions engaged in warfare elsewhere to replenish them. The heroic sacrifices of the Japanese forces in Saipan inflicted significant damage on the enemy, forcing them to fight a bloody war. This achieves the ideal objective of the Japanese forces, making the enemy's advance benefit the Japanese situation. According to a New Delhi dispatch dated the 25th of this month, President Roosevelt, in view of the urgency of the Pacific war situation, has signed and implemented a plan to increase the number of active-duty soldiers by 200,000. From the opposite perspective of this news, it is clear that the losses in the American Pacific war are so great that they cannot be replenished without 200,000 additional personnel. In a previous press conference, it was mentioned that the enemy's manpower losses in Saipan must be over 100,000, which can now be confirmed. Furthermore, according to a statement issued by the U.S. Navy Department on June 22, the total manpower losses of the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard since the start of the war amounted to 220,006 dead, 9,522 missing, and 4,469 captured, for a total of 49,575 personnel. Additionally, Nimitz announced that the American troop losses in the Saipan operation were approximately 15,000. Combining these figures and considering Roosevelt's proposal to supplement with 200,000 personnel, it is worthy of contemplation. A discerning person can naturally deeply discern where the key lies.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Manpower Will Be Exploited: Nimitz has repeatedly clamored that it is necessary to fight against Japan on the Chinese mainland. The purpose is to exploit the resources of the Chinese people. Recently, Wallace also strongly emphasized this necessity upon returning to the United States. He believes that only by using American weapons to drive the Chinese people to fight against Japan can the loss of American soldiers be replenished. Nimitz strongly advocated this after the Gilbert Islands operation. Recently, Nimitz is deeply concerned that this argument will be met with resentment from the Chinese people, and has slightly changed his position, stating that even if they reach the Chinese mainland, they will use naval operations to replace land warfare, in order to avoid dissatisfaction among the Chinese people. Observing the American war situation from another perspective, it appears to be advancing on the surface, but in fact, the enemy has been lured by the clever operations of the Japanese army, and the cost of continuing to fight is bleeding them dry. We firmly believe that "things will develop in the opposite direction when they become extreme," and we will see the United States exhaust its manpower resources, suffer a setback, and be defeated.</p>
<p>US Forbids Families to Communicate with Soldiers</p>
<p>After the American troops landed on Saipan Island, they broadcast announcements prohibiting the families of soldiers in the United States from communicating with soldiers engaged in combat. This prohibition on all communication indicates that the situation is urgent and becoming more pressing by the day.</p>
<p>American Aims to Enslave East Asia</p>
<p>During his recent trip home, Wallace expressed his so-called travel impressions, saying that the American way of life is the best way of life and that people in all the countries he visited expressed admiration for the American way of life. He also said that after the war, American materials and Asian resources could be used to seek American prosperity, and that the future development of Asia must be included within the American West Coast. From this, it can be seen that the real purpose of the American war is to enslave all the people of Asia. It is definitely not the beautiful goal that Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and Song Meiling have long admired.</p>
<p>Habitual Contempt for China and Japan</p>
<p>Recently, some American airmen in China were captured. One of them, after graduating from college, was sent to China after six months of training. He received training in Kunming, Guilin, and other places. After being captured, he was extremely arrogant. When asked about his impression of the Chinese people, he replied that there is absolutely no nation in the world as inferior as the Chinese nation. When asked about his impression of the Japanese people, he said that, of course, they are the same as the Chinese. When asked what he thought of Chinese women, he said that his initial impression of them was not good, and after interacting with them, his impression became even worse. Recently, one day, I passed Jiangwan Road and witnessed an interesting event that I would like to share with you. That day, two vehicles carrying American and Filipino prisoners of war were traveling on Jiangwan Road. When they saw several Japanese women coming towards them, the Filipino prisoners in the front vehicle gestured to the Japanese women to welcome them, while the American prisoners in the rear vehicle pretended to ignore them and looked sideways. As the two vehicles continued to advance, they encountered several Chinese women and children on the left side of the road. The Filipino prisoners continued to act as before, while the American prisoners threw cigarette butts at the women and children. From these two sets of facts, it can be seen that the American habit of despising the Chinese and Japanese people has become ingrained. It is said that some Chinese people in Shanghai are still eagerly hoping for the arrival of the Americans. These facts can be used for reference by such people.</p>
<p>German New Weapons Scare Americans</p>
<p>Germany has recently used a new type of weapon on the Eastern Front, the V1 "flying bomb" and the V2 "one-man midget submarine." The detailed names are not yet known. The great destructive power has frightened the United States and Britain. The U.S. Secretary of Propaganda expressed astonishment at the new weapons, but after hearing about the structure and combat power of this new German weapon, it is said that his heart stopped for a minute.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Suspension of Publication of Japan's Two Major Magazines, "Kaizo" and "Chuo Koron" <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Chuo Koronsha and Kaizosha, two publishing houses with a long history in the Japanese publishing industry, were reorganized into comprehensive magazines and current affairs magazines named "Kaizo" and "Chuo Koron," respectively, in accordance with the Enterprise Consolidation Order of March of this year. However, recently, in the business policies of the two companies, there have been facts that are difficult to tolerate in terms of guiding national thought. The Information Bureau resolutely declared that the two companies should voluntarily suspend publication. At 3:00 PM on the 10th, Hashimoto, the Second Director of the Information Bureau, summoned Yamamoto Takahiko, the president of Chuo Koronsha, and informed him of this intention. Both companies understood this intention and voluntarily suspended publication. Chuo Koronsha was established in the Meiji 20th year as a magazine of the Hanseikai. From the 33rd year, it published "Chuo Koron." In the Showa 4th year, it welcomed the current president, Shimanaka, and has been a dominant force in the publishing industry for 59 years until today. Currently, the company publishes two magazines, "Chuo Koron" and "Illustrated Science," both of which have been suspended. Kaizosha was founded in the Taisho 8th year. "Kaizo" magazine ceased publication in June of this year. The two magazines "Tanka Kenkyu" and "Jikyoku Kenkyu" will also cease publication in the future. As a result of the closure of these two companies, only two comprehensive magazines, "Gendai" and "Koron," remain. (Translated from the July 11th Mainichi Shimbun)</p>

<p>Special Edition on Social Insurance</p>
<p>— Ding Mocun</p>
<h3 id="e69">Social Insurance Over the Past Year <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>This Bureau began implementing the city's compulsory labor insurance on July 22 of last year, and it has now been exactly one year. Here, the progress made over the past year is specifically described below:</p>
<p>Number of Insured Persons</p>
<p>According to the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance, social insurance was originally divided into two types: compulsory labor insurance and general occupational insurance. The former stipulates that all employees working in factories, mines, or engaged in dangerous or unsanitary work are insured under compulsory labor insurance. The latter insures employees engaged in the same business or officials serving in the same institution or organization. After the establishment of this Bureau, Shanghai was designated as the national center of industry and commerce. Therefore, compulsory labor insurance was first implemented in this city. A notice was issued on July 22, and personnel were dispatched to factories to encourage them to purchase insurance. Thanks to the assistance of the city's industrial community, relevant agencies, and trade associations, the number of insured factories has reached 2,065 in the past year, with 57,764 insured persons. The statistical data of the number of insured factories and insured persons by industry is as follows:</p>
<p>(Note) The "Other" category includes more than 30 industries such as shoe manufacturing, ink manufacturing, gas lamps, woodwork, rice noodles, ceramics, tin foil, celluloid, cotton batting, toothbrushes, cakes, ready-made clothes, milk powder, leather shoes, box manufacturing, electric welding, sawing, box-making, instruments, paint, alcohol, seasoning, thermos bottles, metal wire, and oil extraction. Since the number of insured persons in each industry is less than 100, they are not listed separately.</p>
<p>Premium Income</p>
<p>As for the insurance premium rate, except for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers who have separate regulations due to the special nature of their work; the compulsory labor insurance for general factories is based on the standard remuneration of the insured persons, and the employers are responsible for paying 50% of the insurance premium. In the past year, the total insurance premium income was 424,460 yuan. The monthly cumulative number of insured persons in each factory, the insurance premium income, and the average burden per insured person are statistically shown as follows:</p>
<p>Benefit Expenditures</p>
<p>The employer's obligation to the insurer (this Bureau) is the payment of insurance premiums, while the insurer's obligation to the insured has three aspects: first, insurance benefit expenses; second, medical facility expenses; and third, business maintenance expenses. The insurance premium income and the average burden per insured person have already been mentioned above. Now, the insurer's obligations to the insured are explained separately:</p>
<p>A. Insurance Benefits: Insurance benefits refer to the subsidies provided by this Bureau to the insured when they suffer economic losses due to insurance accidents (such as injury, illness, disability, death, and childbirth of female workers) occurring while performing their duties. The statistical data of expenditures in the past year is as follows (amounts below one thousand yuan are not included):</p>
<p>Benefit Items; Amount</p>
<p>Actual Medical Expenses 1,069,000 yuan</p>
<p>Sickness Allowance 214,000 yuan</p>
<p>Injury Allowance 216,000 yuan</p>
<p>Childbirth Allowance 185,000 yuan</p>
<p>Disability Allowance 103,000 yuan</p>
<p>Funeral Expenses 112,000 yuan</p>
<p>Survivors' Pension 138,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total 2,037,000 yuan</p>
<p>B. Medical Facilities: Medical facility expenses refer to the special facility expenses used by this Bureau to improve the health of the insured, which is different from the actual medical situation in the aforementioned insurance benefits. It includes health guidance, medical equipment, important medicines, and diagnostic equipment, etc. The expenditure figure for the past year was 1,000,598 yuan.</p>
<p>C. Business Maintenance Expenses: This includes necessary expenses related to business operations, such as salaries of business personnel, printing, paper, contract surveys, etc. The expenditure figure for the past year was 1,503,052 yuan.</p>
<p>The total of the three items is 4,540,312 yuan, exceeding the total annual insurance premium income by 300,000 yuan. The average monthly expenditure is 378,359 yuan. According to the above statistical data, insurance benefits account for 45%, medical facility expenses account for 22%, and business maintenance expenses account for 33%.</p>
<p>Special Insurance</p>
<p>Due to the special circumstances of the social insurance for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers in this city, separate business committees were organized to handle them specifically. The progress made in the past year is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Number of Insured Persons: The number of insured persons under the social insurance for tricycle drivers is 7,160, and the number of insured persons under the social insurance for rickshaw pullers is 35,777 (both are cumulative figures up to the end of June of this year).</p>
<p>(B) Insurance Premiums and Income: Due to the special nature of their work, the income of tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers is different from the standard remuneration of general factory workers. Therefore, the collection of insurance premiums for social insurance for tricycle drivers is calculated based on the number of trips, with each trip initially charged an insurance premium of 30 cents, which was recently changed to 50 cents. From October of last year to the end of June of this year, the total insurance premium income was 1,132,505 yuan. The average monthly income is 124,361 yuan. The average monthly burden per insured person is only about 1 yuan. The insurance premium for rickshaw pullers is calculated based on the number of shifts per vehicle, averaging 42 yuan per month per rickshaw. From November of last year to the end of June of this year, the total income was 2,044,148 yuan. The average monthly income is 255,518 yuan. The average monthly burden per insured person is also only about 20 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Obligations to the Insured: The classified total of the annual expenditures of the two business committees for tricycle drivers and rickshaw pullers is as follows (amounts below one thousand yuan are not included): Health Implementation</p>
<p>The purpose of social insurance is to improve national health and stabilize the lives of workers. When an unexpected accident occurs to an insured person, in addition to providing actual medical treatment, this Bureau also provides various allowances. The situation of benefits and payments has been described above. However, medical facilities are not only for treating the insured but also for actively improving health. The implementation of health work over the past year is explained as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Special Contracted Hospitals: In order to implement health work, in addition to directly establishing medical clinics and the First, Second, and Third Clinics, this Bureau also selects hospitals with complete city equipment and hires them as special contracted hospitals, including Tongde (various departments), Nanyang (various departments), Yihe (surgery), Dade (various departments), Leren (various departments), Hudong (various departments), Puan (various departments), Qu Zhibu (various departments), Weiguang (various departments), Dongnan (various departments), Shengsheng (internal medicine and obstetrics), Daduan (various departments), Guanghua Eye Hospital (ophthalmology), and the municipal Nanshi, Huxi, Pudong hospitals, and Gaoqiao hospitals.</p>
<p>(B) Mobile Clinics: In order to improve the health of workers and prevent diseases, a mobile clinic vehicle was set up to organize a mobile clinic team, which went to various factories daily for mobile clinic services. In addition to providing timely treatment for the diseases of the insured, they also provided detailed instructions on improving the sanitary equipment of various factories and improving the health of workers, and implemented various preventive vaccinations and vaccinations according to the season.</p>
<p>(C) Number of People Treated for Diseases: In the past year, the statistical data of the number of people treated for diseases at this Bureau's medical clinics, the First, Second, and Third Clinics, the mobile clinic team, and various special contracted hospitals is as follows:</p>
<p>(Internal Medicine) Colds 6,412 people. Tracheobronchitis 7,684 people. Gastrointestinal diseases 1,035 people. Rheumatic joint pain 723 people. Neurasthenia 315 people. Malaria 1,132 people. Typhoid fever 35 people. Epilepsy 2 people. Pulmonary tuberculosis 921 people. Pleurisy 121 people. Beriberi 241 people. Gout 18 people. Arrow eyes 12 people. Pneumonia 21 people. Intestinal tuberculosis 12 people. Dengue fever 2 people. Arthritis 75 people.</p>
<p>(Surgery) Work-related injuries 6,772 people. Lower limb ulcers 5,143 people. Sores 3,216 people. Eczema 1,389 people. Frostbite 524 people. Scabies 530 people. Periostitis 8 people. Bone tuberculosis 6 people. Burns 691 people. Hemorrhoids 345 people. Cellulitis 32 people. Appendicitis 28 people. Tumors 12 people. Erysipelas 10 people.</p>
<p>(Ophthalmology) Trachoma 2,100 people. Conjunctivitis 324 people. Keratitis 102 people. Ocular muscle paralysis 416 people. Ocular muscle granuloma 316 people. Retinitis 218 people. Corneal foreign body 501 people. Corneal injury 69 people. Eye injury 4 people.</p>
<p>(ENT) Otitis 314 people, sore throat 124 people. Rhinitis 99 people. Tonsillitis 2 people. Toothache 41 people. Brain line inflammation 21 people. Other diseases: Gonorrhea 5 people. Urethritis 14 people. Anthrax 2 people.</p>
<p>Preventive injections and vaccinations 3,096 people. Lymphangitis 2 people. Syphilis 20 people.</p>
<p>Additional Remarks</p>
<p>The general situation of this Bureau's work over the past year has been described above. Upon inspection, the number of insured factories has indeed accounted for more than half of the city's total, but the number of workers insured only accounts for about one-thirtieth of the general estimate, which is regrettable. However, it is considered that social insurance is a new undertaking in our country. Therefore, at the beginning of the implementation, there were very few factory owners who could fully understand and trust it. For example, in the yarn factory industry, only a few people came to the Bureau to purchase insurance at first, and some reported fewer workers than the actual number. After a few months, they saw that the Bureau's payment numbers for insurance accidents among the industry's workers were indeed very large, especially for the funeral expenses and survivors' pensions of deceased workers. They were able to quickly compensate the full amount. Therefore, not only did most factories come to purchase insurance, but also those who had not purchased insurance came to complete the procedures for additional insurance. If given time to establish norms, it will be possible to achieve the expected goals. It is hoped that the industrial community will be aware that stabilizing the lives of workers during this wartime period is a prerequisite for strengthening the strength of society and the country. Social insurance is indeed a necessary measure to address current needs. It is hoped that they will continue to cooperate and promote it so that this type of undertaking can be spread everywhere.</p>
<p>Fines</p>
<p>Why should labor insurance be compulsory? Here is a ready-made metaphor: just as vaccination is compulsory in order to achieve widespread epidemic prevention, labor insurance is also the same. In order to seek widespread stability in the lives of workers, it is necessary to use the law to enforce it.</p>
<p>Therefore, factories that refuse to provide compulsory labor insurance for their employees must be subject to fines. The compulsory labor insurance fine rules set by the Ministry of Social Resources are divided into two parts: first, factories that refuse to purchase insurance are fined up to 10,000 yuan; second, factories that fail to pay insurance premiums overdue are fined based on the number of days overdue and the percentage of the amount due. As for those who falsely report the number of insured persons and the standard remuneration in each factory, if it is found to be true, the difference will be doubled. Article 9 of the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance stipulates that the fines shall be decided by the Insurance Bureau. If the fines are not paid within ten days after the announcement, the police or court may be requested to enforce them. Factories that have been penalized must still purchase insurance or pay fees.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Social Insurance Bureau Anniversary <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The Social Insurance Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has been established for a year. In order to clarify the current status of social insurance implementation to all sectors, the bureau will hold its anniversary celebration at the Medical Capital Garden on Taixing Road at 5:00 PM this (29th) afternoon, and a tea party will be held to entertain leaders from all walks of life in the city and owners of insured factories. Ding Mocun of the Ministry of Social Welfare will personally attend to give instructions. The bureau has also specially compiled charts and photographs, totaling more than 50 types, to showcase the implementation of social insurance over the past year. These will be displayed and exhibited publicly at the venue.</p>
<p>(1) The machinery industry has the most insured factories, followed by the cotton textile and silk textile industries.</p>
<p>(2) The average monthly burden for each insured person in the past year was 35.50 yuan, while the benefits they received were: insurance benefits of 18 yuan, medical facility costs of 9 yuan, and business maintenance costs of 12 yuan, totaling 39 yuan. In other words, the Social Insurance Bureau had to bear an expenditure of 3.50 yuan per month for each insured person.</p>
<p>(3) According to statistics, on average, one in ten people is injured while performing their duties.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Small Statistics <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>(4) Business maintenance costs refer to the salaries of salespersons, contract investigations, printing paper, collection, and other administrative expenses. A total of 1.5 million yuan was spent in eleven months, averaging only 135,000 yuan per month, and each insured person bears only 10 yuan per month. However, it is reported that the business maintenance expenses spent by the bureau in the first month required each insured person to bear about 65 yuan, while now it is 7 yuan, a ratio of ten to one. Therefore, the more insured people there are, the less the insured person bears for business maintenance costs.</p>
<p>(5) Under the insurance benefits item, actual medical expenses account for more than one-half, and other subsidies are mostly for diseases and injuries. According to records, one worker enjoyed benefits of more than 37,000 yuan due to illness for the actual medical portion. Recently, each outpatient visit costs an average of about 70 yuan in medical expenses. Initially, it was only 20 yuan, but recently it requires 110 yuan because the price of medical materials has also risen along with general commodity prices.</p>
<p>(6) The average mortality rate of rickshaw pullers is two deaths per week.</p>
<p>(7) On average, four out of ten iron factory workers, rickshaw pullers, and tire drivers suffer from lower limb ulcers.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Standard Remuneration Calculation Method <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>1.  The standard remuneration referred to in Article 7 of the Provisional Outline of Social Insurance and the insurance application form refers to all remuneration obtained by laborers through labor. Compulsory labor insurance is based on this standard remuneration as the basis for calculating insurance premiums. If the insured person encounters incidents such as sickness allowances, injury allowances, maternity allowances, disability allowances, or survivor's pensions, the insurance benefits will also be calculated based on the standard remuneration.</p>
<p>2.  Standard remuneration is divided into four items: wages, allowances, other, and total. Their meanings are explained one by one as follows:</p>
<p>Wages: Refers to the salary or remuneration earned by an employee of an enterprise for working for the owner.</p>
<p>Allowances: Refers to allowances obtained by employees for working for the owner in addition to salary or remuneration, such as rice allowances, housing allowances, and living allowances.</p>
<p>Other: Refers to remuneration obtained by employees for working for the owner in addition to the above two items. For example, if the factory provides meals, the amount converted from the meal expenses will be included in this item. The meal conversion is temporarily calculated at 800 yuan.</p>
<p>Total: Refers to the total amount of wages, allowances, and other remuneration (such as the converted amount for meals) obtained by employees for working for the owner.</p>
<p>3.  Standard remuneration is calculated on a monthly basis in principle. For those paid annually, it is one-twelfth of the annual salary. For those paid on a daily basis, it is 30 times the daily wage. If the salary is calculated by the hour, by piece, or the income is unstable, it is calculated by one-third of the total income obtained in the 90 days before the date of determining the standard remuneration.</p>
<p>4.  If the insured person has difficulties in calculating standard remuneration or the calculation is improper, the Insurance Bureau may calculate the standard remuneration by appropriate methods. For example:</p>
<p>Standard remuneration is the average monthly income. It should be calculated according to the actual situation. For example, when calculating the standard remuneration according to Article 3, if the specified period happens to be due to special circumstances or work stoppage due to illness for many days, the calculated amount of standard remuneration must be too low. It is fair to calculate it based on the actual number of working days.</p>
<p>If the salary is calculated on a daily basis but the actual number of working days per month is less than 30 days, it should also be calculated according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>If there are seasonal businesses, where income increases or decreases significantly during a certain period, the Insurance Bureau may handle it with reference to the actual situation.</p>
<p>5.  When an insured person has more than one job at the same time, the remuneration from each job should be combined.</p>
<p>6.  Explanation of meal expense conversion:</p>
<p>According to the standard remuneration of the insured person filled in by general insured persons, the average for those who do not provide meals is more than 1,000 yuan, while those who provide meals are less than 200 yuan, and some maintain the wages from five years ago. In terms of monetary calculation, the former is obviously more than the latter, but in reality, the latter is better than the former. For the collection of insurance premiums, if only calculated based on the amount, the latter is certainly less than the former, but the insurance benefits enjoyed, except for actual medical care, others such as injury allowances, sickness allowances, etc., are also calculated proportionally, and the loser is still the insured person. In this case, the amount converted from the food should be included in the calculation.</p>
<p>The conversion of meal expenses is based on price valuation. Currently, ordinary meal expenses, such as completely allocated rice, plus fuel and vegetable expenses, require more than 1,000 yuan per month for two meals per person. If calculated based on the fixed price of catered meals, each meal costs more than 3,000 yuan. In order to reduce the payment of insurance premiums, a uniform calculation of 800 yuan is used for the time being.</p>
