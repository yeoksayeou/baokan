<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">建設人才 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>戰乘愈劇烈，建設愈重要。後方的肆設決定前方戰鬥的力量，後方建設的多寡因此可以決定戰事的勝負。在國家亟需建設的時候，建設人才就特別顯出他的重要性。</p>
<p>在這次大東亞戰爭裏，中國到目前為止還在後方，後方的責任是增產，增產就是建設。假使我們的建設有好的成續，那末，大東亞戰爭赤有好結果。假使我們的建設沒有成續，那末，處在後方的中國自然是不得了，前棧戰爭的結果當然亦不必說。中國是一個產業落後的國家，生產事業少，建設人才少，因此我們對於正在從事建設的人才，寄予莫大的希望，政府應當十分的珍惜，建設人員本身應當十分的自重。</p>
<p>政府第一應當愛惜人才，不要用之過分或不及，用之不當，因而毀滅他的前途，，失掉國人的信仰，最為可惜。所謂「知人善用」，「取長補短」，是選擇人才，培植人才的不二法門。</p>
<p>政府第二應當信任人才。選擇決定之後，就當絕對信任。凡是責任必基於職權，而職權必由於信任。不信任而授以職權，旣授聯權而又牽制，使不能行使職權，最是辦事上的錯誤。不予以職權而强人負逾分的貴任，更是不應該。政府要付辦事人以全權，辦事人自然也就當負全貴。</p>
<p>政府第三要人才公有。人才公有的意義就是說人才是社會國家的公器，並非某黨某派某人的工具。建設人才是國家所公有的，他不受任荷黨派和個人的支配。任何黨派和任何個人不能存佔有的心理，以為非歸己用不可，因之遺誤國家的大事。</p>
<p>建設人才本身第一應當　於職務。這　做事的起碼條件，而建設事業更為重要，因為建設事業關係於現在和將來，不能雊空言了事，更不能够欺騙世人。受國家培養的人必須要脚踏實地，把成績表演出來，方才無愧於己，無愧於入，無愧於國。</p>
<p>建設人才木身第二應當廉於操守。建設事業在在與經濟有關係，建設事業更大多是公共經濟關係。操守不廉，就可成為關家的大罪入，毀滅了自己，更帶累了國家的大事。「一念之錯」可以鑄成「終身之恨」，這是最最要自勵的。</p>
<p>目前的中國正處在積極建設的時代，建設人才的需要更比任何事件為孔急。時間的迫切，已經不能雊使我們只是「坐而言」，而要我們「起而行」，我們把我們所行的成續，決定我們的命運。在這個大時代裹面，政府和建設人才本身都是應當萬分注意。</p>

<p>南京二十七日中央社電頃得財政部她息，關於華北　中問旅客携帝紙幣之交換限額，會於本年三月一日起，改訂實施辦法，茲因淮海省調整通貨之關係、特自三月二十七日起，重行改訂實施辦法，探錢如左：　陸路，由華中往華北或華北往華中，一二等每人以中　券五千元為限，三四等二千五百元為限，　海路同上。　空路。由華中往華北。或由華北往華中，每人以中儲券五千元為限。關於華中華北間一般金融機關之匯款，每人限額亦提高至五千元，凡華中華北間金融機關相互通匯，其數額在五千元以內者，可自由行之。</p>
<h3 id="c7">地中海方面的　蘇聯外交攻勢 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>蘇聯的承認巴陀里奧政權，事前並未通吿英美，故其眞意如何，頗使英美當局及其左翼勢力焦慮，尤以波蘭問題，南國問題，義　　分割問題等許多事實，均為說明英美蘇三國不致協力的有力證明。英美方面雖忠實際行本國有關義大利的條約，然蘇聯竟與被征服國樹立外交關係，道顯然有背休戰條約的精神，結果，英美紙有用不傷自己面予的方法，追隨蘇聯之後，不得不承勝巴陀里與政　。</p>
<h3 id="c8">蘇聯的眞意不明 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>於是巴陀里奧的地位暫見强化，義王愛麥處限退位間題赤擱軍不談。向來猛烈攻擊巴陀里奧與愛麥處限的英美左翼派，及美國的共產黨，對於蘇聯的外交手段，疑感不解，但史太林終究不會支持君主政體的原則，蘇聯政府的政策，當然</p>
<p>軍事的事　更重於意識方面的事實，祇　要是與德國交戰的政體，不管它是那一種政體，都予以，用支持巴陀里奧政權的方式，使南義社會全部陷於混亂，而製造爆發全面革命的地盤。</p>
<p>但根本上蘇聯此次的搭置，顯然是從其遼大的地中海政策出發的。從這意義看來，進如北非法政權問題，蘇聯的對西亞工作，近如南國的蒂多政權隊問題，義艦隊問題，與蘇聯的態度，無疑有不可分的關係。</p>
<h3 id="c9">美國政府的焦慮 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>據華感頓來電，羅期福於十五日在白宮召集國務鄉赫爾，討論頗久，對德黑蘭會談以後蘇聯政府獨斷的外交，頗爲焦慮。一般人觀測，此次的承認巴陀里奧政權問題，或將對蔡聯政府採取茶種外交上措置。</p>
<p>更據華盛頓政界情報，在此次承認巴陀里奧政權問題中活羅的義大利諮詢委員會蘇聯代表維辛斯基氏，被召回本國，另遣新代表繼其後任。對此，英美方面頗懷危機，以為蘇聯或將決心退出義大利　詢委員會。一般觀測，英美勢力在義大利　詢委員會中占優勢，蘇聯早就表示不滿，所以蘇聯的退出該委員會，未必是不可能的。倘使此舉實現，則在地中海方面英美對蘇聯的對立關係，更將發嚴至新階段。（翔：譯自三月十八日東京　買知報）</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央社電據細甸某根據地電，敵滑翔機部隊降至緬甸領內當貢地區，企國由背後予日軍以威脅，然此等部隊，除由空中輸送補給之物資外，實別無他途，故敵軍司令部此種愚笨之舉動，無異於作　自縛，且足以暴露其日暮途窮之弱點。斯蒂威爾所指揮之美空軍，目前祇能顧及富貢地區戰綫及美渝軍之補給，故决無旁顧之餘力，因此乘虛而進擊，中部緬印之日軍，逐司不受任何牽制，而得以充分發揮其戰鬥之威力，故原欲企國優亂日軍後方之滑翔機部隊，今不但不能達到　目的，且反而自行送死也。</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電據舊金山廣播稱：日印同盟軍在梯迭姆通伊姆法爾之公路上，與英印軍激戰，聞刻更向仁巴爾前進。</p>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電據印度電合廣播，印英軍司令官歐一來慶克將軍，二十七日再度在中央立法會戰中報告戰况稱：侵入阿薩密之日印軍，刻正繼續有利進展中。今後應斟量戰局情形，迅速調派近東及義大利戰綫之反軸心軍增援。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電日印軍突破印度國境後，已漸將敵方批抗力粉碎，而績向印度領內深入，並迫進敵最重要據點伊姆法爾盆地。故該方面之戰况巳達近最高潮。</p>
<p>日機大編隊猛襲吉大港</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電據緬甸“軍某基地電，日軍突破印度國境，刻正以破竹之勢猛進，日機更予以呼應，二十五日突　戰鬥機，轟炸機聯合大編隊，猛襲吉大港敵機塲在該地上空與敵噴火式機三十架交戰，將其擊退，更於敵高射砲火熾烈發射中，對敵面塲反覆掃射及轟炸，擊毀其大型機一架，小型機一架。歸途更於某基地上空遭逢敵火箭式P38型戰鬥機八架，當展開空戰，繫落其六架（內不確者三架），全部安返基也。</p>

<p>東京二十八日中央　　。印度國民　　　軍支援下　，終於攻入印度，刻印度臨時政府對推進行政正進行準備，日前外相現外　省顯問白烏敏夫，頃談日軍及印度國民軍進攻度在政治及軍事上之意義稱：此次印度國民軍在日軍協力下攻入印度，　特巴頓必感恐慌，渠抵任年餘毫無　樹，今不　奪回　　之作戰　　　　，即其本身亦發生動搖。蓋印度國民軍攻人印領，在軍事上含義實極深長，於政治上亦予敵方以極大之打擎，綠印人本非好戰國民，性極沈　，同時擁有三億五千萬之龐大人口，此大部人口雖在英國之壓迫下，亦未滅少，今其生命力與無限之活力，終於結成一圑，而能充分發揮。况印度國民軍今為爭求祖誠獨立，已開始武裝進攻，印度全國民衆，自必羣起響應，印度三億五千萬民衆一且崛起，二三百萬之英美人，又何足懼。此次作戰，乃對印度之獨立運動具有絕對自信之表現，故其意義重大：料英國即將開始彈壓或檢　印人，然印度獨立運動巨頭多已被監禁，故再行彈壓絕無效果。若欲澈底　淸，勢須檢舉整個三億五千萬印人，且英國本身現尙右歐洲第二戰綫問題之糾紛與德機之轟炸英本土等間　急待解决。又以英國一切均仰仗美國，可知一五國已無顯及印度問題之能力，現國美反較英　關難，再最惑　　者，壓為重慶，現自富買之退路已被遮斷，逾印公路之建設前途亦極　淡，美國雖亦協力建設，然此與建設阿拉斯加公路根本逈異。同時，重慶內與印度完全隔離，惟有自趨滅亡而已由於印度獨立與渝方之陷於孤立，反軸心陣營巳喪失兩大基地，於是英美在東亞實行反攻之企圖遂成泡影，江特拉斯氏相信信，印人必能崛起抗英，縱印度國內崛起之印人裝備小足，然可以多取勝，人口之多寡，於此次之大戰中，乃决定勝負之一。</p>

<p>首由渡副局長致詞，略謂：關於籌組警察消費合作社一事，前已兩度舉行談話，其辦法已迭見報戰，諸位諒已悉知。現在上海物便高漲，生活不能安定，尤其是警察，收入微薄，難以維持，故擬設立消費合作社，平價配給警察各項日用品，使警察安心服務，此事端賴各界熱烈贊助，十分感激。</p>
<h3 id="c36">蘇副局長詞 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>次由蘇副局長致詞，略調：本月十六日，會邀請各界茶會，請求贊助組織消費合作社，厥後蒙各界領袖積極響應，特別是市民福利協會聞蘭亭先生，市商會震　登先生，商統會唐壽民先生，銀行公會棄扶霄林康侯兩先生，錢業公會的裴雲卿陸書臣兩先生，及中儲行華興銀行當局，以及盛幼盒先生贊助長力。而上海新聞界對於贊助合作社的宜傳亦甚出力。二十六日申損刋載長風君一筆論文，高見極篇欽佩。自下政府經費困難，只能請求各界贊助，使警察獲得若干平價的日用品，以補生活之不足，此為組織警察消費合作社的動機。長風君主張警察消費合作社不應限於一區，而以全泒警察為範國，極有價値。本局全人尤為贊成與感激。現在全滬警士約有二萬人連家屬約計十萬人。因此，資金一項經過精密之統計至少需一萬萬元，此項資金純係借貸性質，將來必設法歸還，務請各界領袖特別贊助，最好於旬日內籌足，以便早日成立。至於合作社資金的保管與出納，擬請銀錢業公會及商統會派員監督辦理，以示慎重。至於各業分認辦法，亦經多方研究，少頃請陳彬穌先生報吿。</p>
<h3 id="c37">李思浩詞 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>來　中首由李思浩先生致詞，略謂：警祭消費合作社資金原定四十萬元，今以全滬警士為範圍，此數當然太少，興其將來陸續增加，不如一次籌足為妥，本人對於　足一萬萬元之建議，極爲贊同，此種確立上海治安基本辦法，希望金融界及各業公會盡力贊助，以促其成。</p>
<h3 id="c38">唐壽民詞 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>商統會唐理事長致詞，略謂：上海全市治安的責任，在人民方面。仰賴於警察擔負，因此，對於警察生活的艱苦，市民應富寄以最大同情，盡力掖助，使生活改善。况且，在目前戰局戰重時期。後方治安，尤關重要，警察的責任愈重大，生活的安定就愈需要。目下警察的薪給，每月不過千餘元，在現在物價高漲的情形下，欲其瞻養五口之家，無論如何是不够的，所以組織淸費合作社，實屬至要，本人十分贊同。至於商統會方面，在司能範圍內可以掖助者，自當盡力。合作社的目的，在掖助二萬員警十萬家屬解决生活，一萬萬元資金雖嫌　大，但做到澈底解决，或許尙嫌太少。至於根本辦法，我們市民還耍請求市政當局關整警士待遇。</p>
<h3 id="c39">吳署長詞 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>第一區公署吳署長頌皋繼起致詞，略謂：經濟與洽安息息有關，精神生活與物質生活有不可分離的關係，所謂「衣食足而後知榮導」。警察的工作，與市民時刻發生關係，警察工作不力，對於市民福利的影響甚大，警察消費合作社，由官方發動，期望民間協力贊助，官方機關是縱的組織，民間團體是續的組織，官民協力，可以解决上海的一切問題。上海為戰時經濟中心，故必須官方與人民打成一片，官民協力合作，再進而中日合作。警察消費合作社的成功，可以反映將來上海其他事業成功的程度如何。</p>
<h3 id="c40">陳彬龢詞 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>繼由陳彬龢報告略謂：本人舉警察當局之委託及地方前輩開蘭亭林康侯李思浩葉扶臀諸先生之命，向各方商洽借款，各方贊助極為熱烈。如中儲行華與銀行當局首先允借巨款。廿五日上午拜訪唐壽民先生，指示關於請求日用品配給的數量，以及借款辦法，詳細討論達三小時之久。廿四晚拜訪盛幼實先生，即蒙槪借二百萬元。他如各業領袖吳蘊齋張慰如許冠羣許曉初敦順邵樹舉項康原吳庸庵陳伯藩陳承綸詹沛霖謝筱初諸先生均表示熱烈贊助。現在一萬萬元資金，分認熱借力求平均，第一請求中儲行及華興銀行當局增加借墊數目。第二請求銀行公會，墊借二千萬元。錢業公會墊借一千萬元。第三本市各同業公會，約計百餘單位，茲假定爲六十單位，擬分為三等，請求墊借二百萬元者十單位，墊借一百萬元者二十單位，墊借五十萬元者三十單位，合共五千五百萬元。第四請求特殊商業公司及般富，假定二十單位，每單位認墊五十萬至一百萬元。以上支配辦法，均經警察當局及地方前輩諸公之同意，一二日內當由市民福利協會分函各同業公會領袖，詳列借墊數目及各項辦法，事關地方治安，務求盡力贊助。</p>
<h3 id="c41">聞蘭亭詞 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>最後由市民福利協會開理事長致詞，略謂：警察負維持治安之奮，組織警察消費合作社，雖屬帮助改善警察生活的事，但實際上就是市民自己的事，希望各業領袖善體斯旨，對於一萬萬元之資金，踴躍墊借，至於繳款日期，最好規定為十天至兩星期，以便各業諸君從容籌措。當經蘇副局長表示感謝，旋共進茶點，至五時半散會。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Construction Talent <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>As the war becomes more intense, construction becomes all the more important. The establishment of the rear determines the strength of the front lines; therefore, the quantity of construction in the rear can determine the victory or defeat of the war. At a time when the nation urgently needs construction, the importance of construction talent is especially evident.</p>
<p>In this Greater East Asia War, China is still in the rear for the time being. The responsibility of the rear is to increase production, and increasing production is construction. If our construction efforts have good results, then the Greater East Asia War will have good results. If our construction efforts are unsuccessful, then China, located in the rear, will naturally be in trouble, and the results of the war on the front lines will be self-evident. China is a country with backward industries, with few production enterprises and few construction talents. Therefore, we place great hope on the talents who are currently engaged in construction. The government should cherish them very much, and the construction personnel themselves should have a great sense of self-respect.</p>
<p>First, the government should cherish talent and not use it excessively or insufficiently, or improperly. Destroying their future and losing the people's faith is most regrettable. The so-called "knowing people and making good use of them" and "taking the strengths to make up for the weaknesses" are the only ways to select and cultivate talent.</p>
<p>Second, the government should trust talent. After the selection is decided, absolute trust should be given. All responsibilities must be based on authority, and authority must be based on trust. It is a mistake in handling affairs to grant authority without trust, and to restrict it after granting authority, so that it cannot be exercised. It is even more inappropriate to force people to bear responsibilities that exceed their authority. The government should give those who handle affairs full authority, and those who handle affairs should naturally bear full responsibility.</p>
<p>Third, the government should make talent public property. The meaning of talent as public property is that talent is a public resource of society and the nation, not a tool of a certain party, faction, or person. Construction talent is publicly owned by the nation, and it is not subject to the control of any party or individual. No party or individual can have a possessive mentality, thinking that it must be used for their own purposes, thus delaying national affairs.</p>
<p>First, construction talent itself should be diligent in their duties. This is the basic condition for doing things, and construction work is even more important, because it is related to the present and the future. It cannot be achieved with empty words, and it cannot deceive the world. People who are cultivated by the country must be down-to-earth and show their achievements, so that they are worthy of themselves, worthy of others, and worthy of the country.</p>
<p>Second, construction talent itself should be honest in conduct. Construction projects are always related to economics, and most construction projects are related to public economic interests. Dishonest conduct can become a great crime against the country, destroying oneself and dragging down national affairs. "A moment's mistake" can lead to "lifelong regret," and this is something that should be most encouraged.</p>
<p>China is currently in an era of active construction, and the need for construction talent is more urgent than any other matter. The urgency of time no longer allows us to merely "sit and talk," but requires us to "stand up and act." We will determine our fate with the results of our actions. In this great era, both the government and the construction talent themselves should pay close attention.</p>

<h3 id="e7">The Soviet Diplomatic Offensive in the Mediterranean <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Soviet Union's recognition of the Badoglio government was not announced to the United States and Britain in advance, so its true intention has caused anxiety among the authorities in Britain and the United States and their left-wing forces. In particular, many facts, such as the Polish issue, the South Country issue, and the Italian partition issue, all provide strong evidence that the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will not cooperate. Although the United States and Britain faithfully implemented their national treaties concerning Italy, the Soviet Union actually established diplomatic relations with a conquered country, which obviously violates the spirit of the armistice treaty. As a result, the United States and Britain had to follow the Soviet Union in a way that would not hurt their own face and had to recognize the Badoglio government.</p>
<h3 id="e8">The True Intention of the Soviet Union is Unclear <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>As a result, Badoglio's position has been temporarily strengthened, and the issue of King Victor Emmanuel III's forced abdication has been shelved. The left-wing factions in the United States and Britain, and the Communist Party of the United States, which have been fiercely attacking Badoglio and Victor Emmanuel III, are confused by the Soviet Union's diplomatic tactics. However, Stalin will ultimately not support the principle of the monarchy. The Soviet government's policy is of course more concerned with military matters than ideological facts. As long as it is a government that is at war with Germany, no matter what kind of government it is, it will be supported. By supporting the Badoglio government, the entire Southern Italian society is thrown into chaos, creating a base for the outbreak of a full-scale revolution.</p>
<p>However, fundamentally, the Soviet Union's actions this time are obviously based on its vast Mediterranean policy. From this point of view, issues such as the North African French government, the Soviet Union's work in West Asia, the Tito regime in Southern Europe, the Italian fleet, and the Soviet Union's attitude are undoubtedly inseparable.</p>
<h3 id="e9">The Anxiety of the United States Government <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt summoned Secretary of State Hull to the White House on the 15th for a lengthy discussion and was quite concerned about the Soviet government's unilateral diplomacy after the Tehran Conference. It is generally speculated that the recognition of the Badoglio government may lead to diplomatic measures against the Soviet government.</p>
<p>According to information from political circles in Washington, in the matter of recognizing the Badoglio government, the Soviet representative to the Italian Advisory Commission, Vyshinsky, was recalled to his country and a new representative was sent to succeed him. In response, the United States and Britain are quite concerned, believing that the Soviet Union may be determined to withdraw from the Italian Advisory Commission. It is generally speculated that the United States and Britain have a dominant position in the Italian Advisory Commission, and the Soviet Union has long expressed its dissatisfaction. Therefore, the Soviet Union's withdrawal from the commission is not impossible. If this move is realized, the opposing relationship between the United States and Britain and the Soviet Union in the Mediterranean will develop into a new stage.

<h3 id="e10">Japanese Army Enters Assam; Continues to Advance; Fierce Fighting in Imphal Basin <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma, enemy glider troops landed in the Dangon area within Burmese territory, attempting to threaten the Japanese army from behind. However, these troops have no other way to transport supplies except by air. Therefore, such a foolish move by the enemy headquarters is tantamount to self-entrapment and is enough to expose its weakness of being at the end of its rope. The US Air Force commanded by Stilwell can currently only take care of the supply of the Fagon front line and the US-Chongqing army, so it has no extra energy to take care of other things. Therefore, the Japanese army in central Burma and India, taking advantage of the void to advance, can exert its combat power without any restraint. Therefore, the glider troops, which originally intended to disrupt the Japanese army's rear, not only failed to achieve their goal, but also sent themselves to their deaths.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a broadcast from San Francisco: The Japanese-Indian Allied Forces are fiercely fighting with the British-Indian army on the highway between Tiddim Tong and Imphal, and it is reported that they are advancing further towards Imphal.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a radio broadcast from India, General O'Reilly, commander of the Indian-British army, reported on the war situation again at the Central Legislative Council meeting on the 27th, saying that the Japanese-Indian army that invaded Assam is continuing to make favorable progress. In the future, the war situation should be considered, and the anti-Axis forces from the Near East and Italian fronts should be quickly transferred to reinforce.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 27th. After the Japanese-Indian army broke through the Indian border, it has gradually crushed the enemy's resistance and continued to advance deep into Indian territory, and is approaching the enemy's most important stronghold, the Imphal Basin. Therefore, the war situation in that area has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft in Large Formation Strikes Chittagong</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 28th. According to a dispatch from a certain Burmese military base, the Japanese army broke through the Indian border and is advancing rapidly. Japanese aircraft responded and suddenly launched a joint large formation of fighters and bombers on the 25th, attacking the enemy airfield in Chittagong. They engaged 30 enemy Spitfire aircraft in the airspace over the area and repelled them. Amidst the intense enemy anti-aircraft fire, they repeatedly strafed and bombed the enemy airfield, destroying one large aircraft and one small aircraft. On the way back, they encountered eight enemy rocket-powered P38 fighter aircraft over a certain base and engaged in an air battle, destroying six of them (three of which are unconfirmed), and all returned safely to their base.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Mr. Toshio Shiratori Expresses His Views on the Significance of the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Attacking India <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency. Under the support of the Indian National Army, the Japanese army finally entered India, and the Indian provisional government is preparing to promote administration. The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Shiratori Toshio, recently talked about the political and military significance of the Japanese army and the Indian National Army's attack on India, saying: "Mountbatten must be panicked by this time. He has done nothing in the past year since he took office. Now, he is not only unable to regain...in the operation..., but he himself is also shaken. The Indian National Army's attack on India has extremely profound military implications and has given the enemy a great blow politically. The Indians are not a warlike people and are extremely calm. At the same time, they have a huge population of 350 million. Although most of this population is under British oppression, it has not diminished. Now, its vitality and unlimited vigor have finally formed a group and can be fully exerted. Moreover, the Indian National Army has now begun an armed attack in order to seek sincere independence. The Indian people will definitely respond in droves. Once the 350 million Indian people rise up, what is there to fear from the two or three million British and Americans. This operation is an expression of absolute confidence in the Indian independence movement, so its significance is great. It is expected that Britain will soon begin to suppress or inspect the Indians, but most of the leaders of the Indian independence movement have already been imprisoned, so further suppression will have no effect. If they want to thoroughly clear it, they must inspect the entire 350 million Indians. Moreover, Britain itself is still facing the second front problem in Europe and the German bombing of the British mainland. Also, Britain relies on the United States for everything, so it can be seen that the five countries no longer have the ability to deal with the Indian problem. Now the United States is more concerned than Britain. The most worrying thing is Chongqing. Now the retreat route from Mumbai has been blocked, and the construction of the Burma-India highway is also very bleak. Although the United States also helps with construction, this is completely different from the construction of the Alaska Highway. At the same time, Chongqing is completely isolated from India and can only move towards destruction. Due to India's independence and the isolation of Chongqing, the Axis camp has lost two major bases. As a result, the Anglo-American attempt to launch a counteroffensive in East Asia has become a bubble. Mr. [name] believes that the Indians will definitely rise up to resist the British. Even if the Indians who rise up in India are not well-equipped, they can win more with less. The size of the population is one of the factors that determine victory or defeat in this war."</p>

<p>Zurich, Central News Agency, 28th. According to front-line news, the focus of the war situation in the southern part of the Eastern Front is still in the three areas of northern Bessarabia, the lower reaches of the Bug River, and the vicinity of Kamenets-Podolsky. The fighting on the Bessarabian Plain is extremely fierce. The vanguard of Konev's Soviet army has arrived in Prut, which has no strategic value. It is generally believed that the Soviet army must aim to reach the front of Romania in order to gain..., increasing the military suppression of the Soviet Union. It is reported that the German army is now continuously transporting large numbers of reinforcements to the front line via Hungary, determined to defend the national border to the death. The Soviet army admits that it is most difficult to break through the German defense line in the Carpathian Mountains, but it fears that the battle line will become deadlocked. It is reported that it has begun to actively utilize the Tito and other troops in Yugoslavia.</p>

<h3 id="e20">The Municipal Government Ordered Wu Song to be Appointed as the Director of the First District Office; He Took Office Yesterday <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Wu Songgao, the Chief Secretary of the First District Office, was recently appointed as the Director of the office by order of the Municipal Government. He took office yesterday (the 28th) and issued a notice to inform the public. The full text of the notice is recorded below:</p>
<p>"According to the order of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, Hu City No. 3082: It is hereby ordered that the aforementioned official be the Director of the First District Office of this city, awaiting further briefing. This order, etc. Upon receiving this order, the Director of this office took office on March 28. In addition to reporting and distributing the order, it is hereby announced to inform the public."</p>
<h3 id="e21">Director Wu's Remarks <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>"Since the administrative power of the former Shanghai Public Concession was returned to our country on August 1 last year, the First District Office was declared established. Mayor Chen Gongbo concurrently served as the Director of the First District Office, and entrusted me with the position of Chief Secretary. For more than half a year, thanks to the guidance of Mayor Chen, the assistance of my colleagues, and the cooperation of all relevant parties, I have been able to avoid making mistakes, for which I am very grateful. On February 1 this year, the two districts were ordered to merge, and I was again ordered by Mayor Chen to adjust the internal organization and personnel of the office to fully adapt to our country's administrative system. In just two months, the takeover of the second district was largely completed. The boundaries of the concessions have been eliminated, and various facilities can now respond to each other and be gradually promoted. The recovery of the former two concessions in this city has come to an end. Now that Director Chen is concurrently serving as the Director due to his busy government affairs, he has re-appointed me to succeed him. I have always served in diplomacy and am ashamed to say that I have no experience in local administration. Moreover, given the complexity of Shanghai's situation and the importance of the first district's administration, I fear that my talent and ability are not up to the task. However, at this time, it is not permissible to avoid responsibility for the sake of public welfare. Therefore, I have accepted this position today. From now on, I will continue to serve the citizens with my consistent spirit. The improvement of district administration is naturally a matter of urgency, but the rational resolution of people's livelihood issues and the transformation of social atmosphere are even more fundamental goals. It is only with the full cooperation of all parties that we can achieve success. I hope that people of insight from both China and Japan will come forward to teach me."</p>

<p>The National General Association of Commercial Control, to meet the needs of citizens, has legally stipulated to first implement the temporary allocation of cotton cloth. The quantity and price of the temporary cotton cloth allocation have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and a "Cloth Purchase Certificate" has been prepared. It will soon be issued by the Municipal Government in accordance with the household rice allocation method, with each household receiving one cloth certificate per person, entitling them to purchase one and a half yards of superior quality cotton cloth at a price of ten yuan, one dime and four cents per yard. It is expected that the general allocation will begin in early next month. Citizens can present the "Cloth Purchase Certificate" to designated cotton cloth retailers to pay for and select their purchases. It is hereby stipulated that all cotton cloth retailers who have joined the Municipal Textile Industry Association as members and operate a storefront with a physical shopfront shall be registered and numbered by the Association. The Commercial Control Association will then print and distribute a "Retailer Number Sign" to each retailer, to be distributed by the Textile Industry Association to each retailer for posting in a prominent place on the storefront.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Charity Sale of Air Raid Lampshades - Practical and Useful, Acknowledged and Supported by the Air Defense Headquarters <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Xin Yun Branch initiated a charity sale of air raid lampshades by youths on the anniversary of the selection of the capital city. It is learned that the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters has expressed special support for this endeavor. According to reports, since the implementation of lighting controls in the city, citizens have been able to cooperate, which is deeply gratifying. Regarding streetlights, the Headquarters has decided to find ways to improve them. However, due to the difficulty for citizens to purchase cloth, indoor lighting has not yet reached the expected results, with some turning off lights very early, affecting daily work. To remedy this deficiency, the Municipal Xin Yun Branch has launched a charity sale of two types of paper air raid lampshades, which are not only practical but also convenient to use. Furthermore, the shades are printed with alert signals and air defense slogans, allowing citizens to refer to them at any time, providing a warning. This is also particularly effective for air defense publicity. It is hoped that relevant agencies will provide as much assistance as possible, and that citizens will adopt them universally, so that the city's air defense lighting controls can achieve the best possible results.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Validity Period of Moving In/Out Permits <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Recently, reporters inquired with the Commercial Control Association and learned that the applicants for the moving in/out permits and removal approval letters often requested an extension of the deadline because they were unable to transport the goods before the deadline. To facilitate applicants, the validity period has been revised as follows: The moving-in permit is uniformly two months. The moving-out permit is uniformly one month. The removal approval letter is uniformly two months. If the goods cannot be transported on time due to transportation issues, those with proof from the shipping agency will be granted a one-time extension. If the goods still cannot be transported on time after the extension, those with proof from the shipping agency will be allowed to apply again free of charge. However, if the goods are not transported after the deadline, regardless of the reason, no further extension will be granted. All issued moving out permits or approval letters, whether used or not, will not have their service fees refunded.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Police Consumer Cooperative Receives Enthusiastic Support from All Quarters; Tea Party Held Yesterday with Leaders from All Industries <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal First Police Bureau, in order to improve the lives of police officers and enhance service efficiency, is planning to establish a police consumer cooperative. On the 16th of this month, the Chairman of the cooperative, Mr. Chen Gongbo, hosted a reception for the industrial, commercial, and financial communities of the city to elect supporting committee members to carry out preparations. A first discussion meeting was then held on the 18th of this month. Yesterday (28th) afternoon at 4:00 p.m., Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau, again invited leaders from all industries to a tea party at the Police Club.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Attendees <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>At 4:00 p.m. sharp, guests arrived one after another, including Wen Lan-ting, Li Si-hao, Tang Shou-min, Lin Kang-hou, Ye Fu-sun, Shao Shu-hua, Shen Er-chang, Xian Nan-qun, Xie Xiao-chu, Ren Xiao-shan, Wu Yun-qi, Wang Huai-lian, Li Zu-fan, Zhu Chuan-gao, Dai Jiang-quan, Zhan Pei-lin, Tang Zhi-liang, Zhang Wei-ru, Lu Feng, and more than 100 chairmen of various trade associations, who were warmly received by Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the cooperative, and the heads of various departments.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Speech by Deputy Director Du <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Director Du delivered a speech, stating: "Regarding the establishment of the police consumer cooperative, we have held two discussions before, and the methods have been reported in the newspapers, which you are all aware of. Currently, prices in Shanghai are soaring, and life is unstable, especially for the police, whose income is meager and difficult to sustain. Therefore, we plan to establish a consumer cooperative to allocate various daily necessities to the police at flat prices, so that the police can serve with peace of mind. This matter depends on the enthusiastic support of all sectors, and we are very grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e36">Speech by Deputy Director Su <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Deputy Director Su then delivered a speech, stating: "On the 16th of this month, we invited guests from all walks of life to a tea party to request support for the organization of a consumer cooperative. Since then, we have received enthusiastic responses from leaders from all walks of life, especially Mr. Wen Lan-ting of the Municipal Welfare Association, Mr. Zhen Deng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Tang Shou-min of the Commercial Control Association, Mr. Ye Fu-xiao and Mr. Lin Kang-hou of the Banking Association, Mr. Pei Yun-qing and Mr. Lu Shu-chen of the Money Trade Association, and the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank, as well as Mr. Sheng You-he, who have generously offered their assistance. The Shanghai press has also been very supportive of the cooperative's publicity efforts. On the 26th, Shen Sun published an article by Changfeng Jun, whose insightful opinions are highly admirable. Since the government's funding is difficult, we can only request support from all sectors to enable the police to obtain some flat-priced daily necessities to supplement their livelihoods. This is the motivation for organizing the police consumer cooperative. Changfeng Jun argued that the police consumer cooperative should not be limited to one district but should cover all police in Shanghai, which is of great value. The entire Bureau fully supports and appreciates this. There are currently about 20,000 police officers in Shanghai, and about 100,000 people including their families. Therefore, after careful statistics, the capital requires at least 100 million yuan. This fund is purely a loan, which will be repaid in the future. We ask that leaders from all walks of life provide special support, and it would be best to raise enough money within ten days so that it can be established as soon as possible. As for the custody and disbursement of the cooperative's funds, we plan to invite representatives from the Banking Association and the Commercial Control Association to supervise and handle it, to show our prudence. As for the method of allocation by various industries, we have also conducted extensive research. Mr. Chen Bin-su will report on this shortly."</p>
<h3 id="e37">Speech by Li Si-hao <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Li Si-hao spoke first, stating: "The original capital of the police consumer cooperative was set at 400,000 yuan, but now that the scope is all police in Shanghai, this number is naturally too small. Rather than gradually increasing it in the future, it is better to raise enough at once. I fully agree with the suggestion of raising 100 million yuan. This is a basic way to establish Shanghai's public security. I hope that the financial community and various trade associations will do their best to support it and promote its success."</p>
<h3 id="e38">Speech by Tang Shou-min <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Tang Shou-min, Chairman of the Commercial Control Association, stated: "The responsibility for the public security of Shanghai lies with the people. We rely on the police to shoulder this responsibility. Therefore, the citizens should have the greatest sympathy for the hardships of the police's lives and do their best to help them improve their lives. Moreover, in the current critical period of the war, the security of the rear is particularly important. The greater the responsibility of the police, the more necessary it is to ensure their livelihood. At present, the salary of a police officer is only about one thousand yuan per month. Under the current circumstances of rising prices, it is impossible for them to support a family of five. Therefore, it is essential to organize a consumer cooperative, and I fully agree with it. As for the Commercial Control Association, we will do our best to assist within the scope of our capabilities. The purpose of the cooperative is to help 20,000 police officers and 100,000 family members solve their livelihood problems. Although a capital of 100 million yuan may seem large, it may still be too small to completely solve the problem. As for the fundamental solution, we citizens still have to ask the municipal authorities to adjust the police's treatment."</p>
<h3 id="e39">Speech by Director Wu <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Wu Song-gao, Director of the First District Office, continued to speak, stating: "The economy is closely related to peace, and spiritual life is inseparable from material life. As the saying goes, 'Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and guidance.' The work of the police is related to the citizens at all times. The ineffective work of the police has a great impact on the welfare of the citizens. The police consumer cooperative is initiated by the government and hopes to be supported by the people. The government is a vertical organization, and the people's organizations are continuous organizations. The cooperation between officials and the people can solve all the problems in Shanghai. Shanghai is a wartime economic center, so officials and the people must work together, and then cooperate between China and Japan. The success of the police consumer cooperative can reflect the degree of success of other undertakings in Shanghai in the future."</p>
<h3 id="e40">Speech by Chen Bin-he <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Chen Bin-he then reported that he had been entrusted by the police authorities and instructed by local elders such as Lan-ting, Lin Kang-hou, Li Si-hao, and Ye Fu-tun to negotiate loans with all parties, and that all parties had been very enthusiastic in their support. For example, the authorities of the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank first agreed to lend a large sum of money. On the morning of the 25th, he visited Mr. Tang Shou-min and discussed in detail the quantity of daily necessities to be requested for allocation and the loan method for three hours. On the evening of the 24th, he visited Mr. Sheng You-shi and was immediately granted a loan of 2 million yuan. Other leaders from all walks of life, such as Wu Yun-zhai, Zhang Wei-ru, Xu Guan-qun, Xu Xiao-chu, Dun Shun-shao, Shu-ju Xiang Kang-yuan, Wu Yong-an, Chen Bo-fan, Chen Cheng-lun, Zhan Pei-lin, and Xie Xiao-chu, also expressed their enthusiastic support. Now, the 100 million yuan in capital should be allocated and borrowed as evenly as possible. First, we will request the Central Reserve Bank and the Hua Xing Bank to increase the amount of their loans. Second, we will request the Banking Association to lend 20 million yuan. The Money Trade Association will lend 10 million yuan. Third, there are about 100 units in various trade associations in the city. Assuming that there are 60 units, they will be divided into three grades, and we will request 10 units to lend 2 million yuan, 20 units to lend 1 million yuan, and 30 units to lend 500,000 yuan, for a total of 55 million yuan. Fourth, we will request special commercial companies and general companies, assuming 20 units, to allocate 500,000 to 1 million yuan per unit. The above allocation methods have been approved by the police authorities and local elders. The Municipal Welfare Association will send letters to the leaders of various trade associations within one or two days, detailing the loan amount and various methods. This matter concerns local security, so we must do our best to support it.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Speech by Wen Lan-ting <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Wen Lan-ting, Chairman of the Municipal Welfare Association, stated: "The police are responsible for maintaining public security. Although organizing the police consumer cooperative is a matter of helping to improve the lives of the police, it is actually a matter for the citizens themselves. I hope that the leaders of various industries will understand this and enthusiastically lend the 100 million yuan. As for the payment date, it is best to set it at ten days to two weeks so that all of you can arrange for it." Deputy Director Su expressed his gratitude, and then they all had refreshments, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30.</p>
<h3 id="e42">List of Directors and Supervisors <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
