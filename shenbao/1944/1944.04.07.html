<h3 id="c1">建立堅强的政治力量 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>本巿工商聯誼會，市民福利協會，國民外交促進協會，新聞聯合會等四團體，昨日下午聯合茶會，歡迎新任市府秘書長吳頌　先生，保安處長熊劍東先生，彬龢參與其盛，曾致簡詞，爰即追記如次：</p>
<p>上海是中國最大的都市，有五百萬人口，居經濟的中心，全國的生產力量大部分集中於此，全國的貿易商業大部分薈萃於此。客觀上應當發生偉大的力量，應當起着領導的作用。可是，大東亞戰爭發生以後，中國參戰以後，上海並未發揮它的偉大力量，並未起着領導作用，以貢獻於戰爭。相反的，有時而一切力量分散浪費。為什麽呢？無可諱言的，中心原因是無堅强的政治丈量，因為政治力量是核心，核心堅强國，周團的依存關係自然也會堅强。核心與周圍都堅强了，自然會發生整個的偉大力量。換言之，如果有了堅強的政治力量作中心，因而把各種力量集中起來，纔能發生偉大力量。如果沒有堅強的政治力量作中心，因而各種力量趨於渙散，渙散以後，就各自走向不正常的途徑。就上海的經濟方面，試加檢討，則發生投機囤積，財富集中於少數入，物價高漲，生產萎縮，薪水階級，生活日漸困難，都是對於國家社會有百弊而無一利的，這是上海無堅強政治力量的例子，無可否認的事實。</p>
<p>所以，我們第一要求，上海必須有堅強的政治力量為中心，集中經濟文化等等其他力量，發生整個偉大力量。所謂堅强的政治力量的促成，可分兩方面講，第一，最高行政機關的市政府，必須健全人事。我們對於陳巿長的才幹與資望，非常欽佩。最近又任命吳頌星先生為第一區公署署長兼市府秘書長，熊劍東先生為保安處長兼淸鄉事務局局長，以吳熊二氏的長才，擔任幹部耍職，我們認為是市府健全人事的決意，很為滿意，很為感激。可是，進一步市府更應檢討直接隸屬的各機關，人事是否健全，如果有才聯府人事如不全部健全，則整個行政效率，行政設施，依然成為問題，而堅强的政治力量，還是談不到。第二，在此決戰時期，後方重要基地的上海，市府各部門負有重要責任者，消極的做到個人不做壞事，個人名譽無損，還嫌不够；同時，必須有勇氣，有肝膽，積極的做到排除萬難，革除一切戰時不應有的病態。這點尤其期待吳熊兩先生以身作則，率先創導。其次，只憑政府少數人的力量，當然還嫌不够，一定加上人民的全面協力。使人民有參加政治的機會，一切政策政令必先普遍取得人民瞭解。因此，眞正的民意機關，就迫切的需要。這樣，使上海做成中國政治的模範區，貢獻戰力的模範區。更進一步做成中日合作的模範區。</p>
<p>就中日合作而言，依照目前實况，距離模範區之目標很遠。中日人民之間，就合作事業或雙方情感觀察，言模範目標，均有未逮。希望今後凡是不合理現象，足為雙方事業合作的障得者，中日雙方應同時反省而改革之。凡是足以增加雙方情感，或生產事業，或與戰爭有利的事業，中日雙方都應繼續努力，誠意合作。</p>
<p>建立堅强的政治力量為中心，配合經濟力量，中日合作，做成中國政治模範區，中日合作模範區。當此決戰緊要關頭，不容我們因循坐誤！不容我們鬆懈忽略！上海建不起堅强的政治力量，則談不到整個中國的政治力量：中國建不起堅强政治力量，則談不到實際貢獻參戰！</p>

<p>印緬國境前綫六日中央社電　頓札恩北方及達姆西北方之敵軍已潰崩退却，現日印軍即於頓札恩至伊姆法爾之公路向北進攻，日印軍某一部已由達姆至巴列爾之公路，開始向西進攻，更由各方面包圍敵之根據地伊姆法爾，目前正對敵第四軍主力三師，展開殲滅戰。爰頓札恩北方之敵第廿三師第三十七旅主力及第十七師等數千殘敵，自一日以來即退入國境錢，開始向北方退却，日印軍即對之進攻，至三日日印軍一部已進至印度境內十公里之地，並予敵以重創。又達姆陷落後，敵第廿三師之一旅及第二十三師之一旅亦隨之潰滅，於是日印軍主力遂由達姆方面向前進擊，同時截斷其退路之另一部日印軍，一日來即連續砲擊達姆西北方敗敵，其汽車羣及基彭（達姆西北十八里）之兵營倉庫等均起火。又遮斷達姆西北方面敵軍退路之日印單挺身隊，已擊襲救援之敵軍，繼續進攻敵第二十師司令部所在地巴列爾（於達姆至伊姆法爾之公路問為伊姆法爾等地之出口）三日已進抵巴列爾東方十公里之處。</p>
<p>印緬國境前綫某基地六日中央社電齊卡國境南方七公里頓札恩伊姆法爾公路，乃印緬國境要衝，敵軍在此更設有防綫，但不堪日軍猛攻，刻已潰走，敵軍於四日夜放火燃燒彈藥倉庫，火勢甚猛，彈藥庫先後發生大爆炸，情形極為凄慘，日軍各部隊更以怒濤之勢，急襲齊卡，至五日拂曉，日軍於砲火掩護下，突入敵陣一角，擊潰敵軍要衝，齊卡不日即可陷落。</p>
<h3 id="c3">印主席鮑斯　再發表聲明　促印人共同爭取獨立 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>仰光五日中央社電　印度臨時政府頃以自由印度地區隨作戰之迅速進展漸形擴大，故現正積極審議諸般行政措置，逐步予以實施，江特拉鮑斯主席四日發表第二次聲明，力言日本對印度決無何等政治經濟及軍事上之野心印度臨時政府乃印度國民唯一合法之政府印人有識者亟應放棄一切參加印度國民軍俾共同爭取祖國之自由與獨立茲録全文如次：諸君，自由印度臨時政府本諸東亞三百萬印人之總意，於一九四三年十月二十一日在昭南創建印度國民軍，已在臨時政府指揮下，突破國境，深入印領。自由印度臨時政府即諸君本身之政府，故吾人必須完成一重大使命，即以武力將英。美逐出印度聖地，以印度國民意志成立恒久之自由印度國民政府，自由印度臨時政府在擊滅英，美軍，將之逐出印度以前，決繼續武力鬥爭，同時並從事建設被解放地區之工作，自由印度臨時政府乃印度國印度國民唯一合法之政府，臨時政府將使印度國民軍及臨時政府任命之行政官，對被解放地區之印度國民予以最大援助與協力。臨時政府乃保障被解放地域印人之生命與財產者，故凡有對敵英，美及共聯合軍有利或為妨碍臨時政府復興印度偉業之行為者，即處以嚴罰，臨時政府甚望印度國民全面協力我同盟軍之日軍。現日軍為粉碎吾等之敵人，正予吾等以無限之支援，英軍於最近兩年，曾以渝·美·澳及東非·西非之軍隊增强其本身勢力，臨時政府有鑒及此，乃在大東亞戰爭開始後，接受日軍支援之好意，相信印度國民軍在日軍協力下，必能粉碎英。美軍，實現印度之完全解放。臨時政府絕對信賴日本對印度之態度，更相信日本對印度無何等政治·經濟·軍事及領土等之野心，日本所關心者，僅在覆滅東亞宿敵，打倒英·美侵略主義，此次大戰始能終結，進而實現世界和平。自由印度臨時政府為使獨立國家政府之條件俱備，現正籌備發行各種單位之盧比，以為印度獨自之通貨，然過去因戰局發展甚速，我軍復向印度國內進攻，故臨時政府發行通貨之準備，亦未能就緒，臨時政府於此情勢下，不得已暫使用日本政府之通貨，以此為臨時措置，一俟臨時政府確立獨自之通貨，自當即行收回日本通貨。諸位同胞，際茲自印度本國驅遂敵惡勢力之時，諸君應為自由印度國民所應為者，參加諸君自己之自由印度臨時政府與國民軍，共同爭取祖國之自由與獨立。</p>

<h3 id="c7">德外長發表談話决保衛羅馬尼亞　謂蘇聯宣言乃政治陰謀 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德外長里賓特羅甫接見羅馬尼亞通訊社駐柏林特派員富多發表談話稱：英·美與蘇聯間之關係，已日趨於困難，因英·美對於克林姆宮之政策，不能加以阻止。關於答覆該特派員之問題，德外長指出，英·美已發覺莫斯科現處於領導地位，但歐洲並不利用英·美·蘇間之裂痕以求擊敗蘇聯，歐洲致勝之唯一途逕，乃有望於歐洲各同盟國之力量。德外長復駁斥敵人謂德軍有毀棄羅馬尼亞之謠傳，而表示德軍防禦羅國與防禦德國之同樣堅決，關於蘇聯謂進入羅馬尼亞純為軍事之目的，有就此以詢問外長之意見，氏答稱：蘇外長莫洛托夫之宣言，對二十五年以來經常注意蘇聯之外交政策者，並無驚異，因政治陰謀，乃常為蘇聯戰略之一部份。當其軍事力量已超過最高點時，蘇聯常使用政治奸計，德人相信所以速進蘇方利用現行手段之理由，係因去年遭受可怖之犧牲後，蘇聯企圖以最少之代價，以結束現行之戰役。蘇人回憶彼等曾一度接近勝利，而結果反遭大敗，故希望儘可能以減少其冒險，此亦可對蘇聯以溫和之停戰條件，以欺騙芬蘭之行動之解釋。其對保加利亞之引誘及羅馬尼亞之諾言，亦均具此種用心，但相信每一羅人均知蘇方諾言之價值。關於英首相在下院所作滿意於莫洛托夫之言論及彼曾對克林姆宮表示英政府之喜慰之忱者，有提出詢問德外長對此事之意見，氏答稱：此事之解釋，極為簡單，此為極端偽善之例證而已，倫敦已能體騐邱吉爾不能抗拒斯達林之事實，均恐此事終有一日成為英國之不幸之結果。央人對於邱吉爾政策之反對，已日漸增高其聲浪，蘇外長之宣言，乃為邱吉爾發表掩飾之好機會而已。邱吉爾已將芬蘭，波羅的海三國，波蘭及巴爾幹諸國犧牲於蘇聯，實則此乃英國對歐之傳統政策之犧牲也。於莫洛托夫發表宣言之後，此賭棍即出現於下院中，偽飾為相隹蘇方宣言之眞意，以造成英國之利益並不受蘇方威脅之印象。有詢問外長對於蘇軍越過羅邊對羅國局勢之意見，德外長答稱：羅馬尼亞乃歐陸之一部份，蘇聯威脅羅國，即對全歐洲之威脅，防禦聶斯德河之戰，如防禦歐洲其他據點一樣。關於有謂因戰略上之理由，德軍有願意放棄羅馬尼亞之意之謠傳，實極為可笑者，此有類於謂德人將放棄柏林者相同，德人防衛羅國，正如對英。美慘重空襲之抵抗一樣，蘇軍越入羅境，乃使德羅兩軍加强合作，德軍保衛羅國領土，直至羅馬尼亞恢復自由及阻止布爾雪維克主義向巴爾幹之侵入為止。</p>

<h3 id="c11">重慶的苦悶 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 今人</p>
<p>在一星期以前，關於漁業條約延長五年以及移讓庫頁島石油石炭權利，日蘇兩國成立協定，多年懸案一旦解決，日蘇兩國間的友好關係，完全可從這經濟的措置上表現出來，亞細亞的東北部份更可安定，此為世人所周知的事實，蘇聯著名報紙消息報眞理報，因了此事各刋載一篇社論，在其結論中曾指出日蘇交涉的成立，就是日蘇間親善關係的表現，並力言兩國友好關係將因此而更加密切云云。但是最受打擊者，當然是英美渝，彼等從蘇報社論中斷章取義，故意歪曲事實，或謂此交涉之成立僅為蘇聯片面的外交上勝利，或謂由此可表示日本立塲的弱化，藉遮掩他們狼狽的情形，聊以自慰。</p>
<p>內心充滿矛盾</p>
<p>敵方此種滑稽性的宣傳，論調亦不一致，重慶當日蘇交涉成立後的第四天，也在電合上用俄國語作穴傳廣播，他們的論調當然跟隨着英美，無甚特色，然而其中有二點殊似重視，蓋重慶對此次日蘇成立交涉，謙虛地說：「因此日本在聯合軍　始攻勢前獲得幾分希望」自認日木立塲已見增强，並特地申述：「此事須商得聯合國間完全諒解」云云，語氣中似對蘇聯在事前曾有一點消息通知聯合國稍露怨憤之色。美報駐重慶特派員奧柏曾於四日在重慶電台廣播，他說日蘇交涉的成立，使重慶增加從日本受到軍事上的威脅，並且拉攏蘇聯參加對日戰爭的希望亦成泡影，這些話刻劃出重慶內心的苦悶。總之，重慶也是亞細亞民族，他們亦希望使亞細亞安定，但是因日蘇交涉成立亞細亞東北部趨於安定而感到苦悶，這是重慶最大的矛盾，重慶如果要脫出道種矛盾，並不是不可能，可惜脫出矛盾的途徑，因為重慶的指導者們掩沒民衆自光，被他們故意遮蔽起來。</p>
<p>在日蘇交涉成立消息傳出後的翌日，莫斯科報紙載稱：「此於重慶又是一個煩惱，」並揭載塔斯通信社烏倫巴特爾特派員關於渝軍在新疆省侵犯蒙古人民共和國邊境的消息。且該特派員稱，蒙古人民共和國政府，是根據一九三六年互相援助條約而成立者，如果渝軍侵犯邊境事件層出不窮則相信蘇聯將對蒙古政府作一切必要援助。</p>
<p>新疆的中央化</p>
<p>世人都知道，塔斯通信社是純粹的　聯國家機關，其報道此較美國的合衆社聯合社不負責任的消息，要翔實得多，並且比較具有重要性，故以塔斯社的一段消息，更使重慶狼狽不堪。再新疆省的「中央化」渝方曾不斷宣傳，現在已經任命新疆省政府主席盛世才為第八戰區副司令，並設置國民黨支部，至少可說其官僚機構大部份已在重慶　握之中，所以邊境方面的衝突事件，亦可說蘇聯的分身蒙古人民共和國與重慶間的衝突。重慶對此事，對內保持沈默，對外則稱：「所傳各節不符事實。」或謂：「外蒙是中國的一部份，蘇聯不應于涉。」甚至用「事實毫無根據」來推托一切。莫斯科政府對此事，至今尙保守緘默，但重慶煩惱與焦燥，已經日甚一日了。此外，又因為對日抗戰，利用中國共產黨，但一方面又恐怕中共勢力日益膨脹，所以政治上軍事上不斷加以攻擊，在這種局面下，重慶已被圍住於用蘇聯與外蒙間關係，蘇聯與中國問關係以及日蘇友好關係所造成的檻圈中，他一綫的希望唯有依賴美國，夢想開羅會談的結果，能見諸實現，然事實上在美國亦認為對日作戰宜放棄重慶而利用中共，例如美國「新共和國」週刋，曾在社論中公然主張支持中共軍，蓋美國以為欲安定亞細亞，中共所具有的政治上軍事上的力量，比較重慶有力，若果然如是，則重慶究將往何處去，嚴正的事實已經把用美國貨雅片盡成的夢境一點點的粉碎了。</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>今天是上海工商聯誼會，市民福利協會，國民外交促進協會，新聞聯合會四團體，歡迎新任巿府秘書長吳頌皐先生，保安處長熊劍東先生。兩位先生都是學騐聲富，英俊有為的大才，本月二日申報短評曾經介紹兩位先生的才華，兄弟很有同感，深為新上海巿政前途慶幸得人。現在請陳彬蘇先生代表致詞歡迎。（原文見今日本報代論）</p>
<p>吳秘書長詞</p>
<p>今天承上海市民福利協會，工商聯誼會，國民外交促進會及新聞聯合會等四團體聯合舉行茶會招待，本人表示非常感謝。　才聽到陳彬　先生的一番話，在兄弟個人看來意義非常重大，這種實貴的意見，不僅可供政府當局，且可供一般社會的參考。</p>
<p>上海地位的重要，剛才陳先生已經講明，本人茲就參加上海地方行政的經過，作一簡單的報告。</p>
<p>本人曾在外交界服務多年，為友人所熟知，但由外交官而逐漸變成地方官，也有動機和原因。去年三月，盟邦日本決定以專管租界交還中國，並決定援助中國，收回其他租界。我的意思以為中國國民革命的目的，在求自由獨立，中國之所以不能獲得自由獨立，原因固多林而不平等條約的束縛，要為主因，如租界一日不收回，中國即一日不能達倒自由獨立。當時本人奉汪主席之命，參加接受租界委員會，及廢除治外法權委員會，本人所以參加此二種工作，因為覺得租界收回，治外法權廢除後，至少對於二十餘年來國民的要求，給以相當的滿足。所以，本人在交還租界協定簽訂後，於去年三月到漢口，接收租界，五月間，奉派至天津，接收法國專管租界，七月中旬，盟邦方面，決定協助中國，交還上海公共租界，同時法國當局，也作同樣表示，交還上海法租界。其後，本人亦參加簽訂交還協定。迨公共租界交還後，組織新機關，辦理前公共租界的行政，當時陳巿長希望本人帮助，擔任主任秘書職務。本人願意擔一任此職的動機有二：</p>
<p>本人很知日本所以將租界交還中國，乃對華實施新政策的表現，而新政策的目的，乃在戰事期間，一步一步扶持中國達到自由獨立，本人覺得盟邦旣懷此好意，即應迎合此好意，故致力於接收公共租界，同時設立新行政機關，即第一區公署以管理前工部局所轄行政，這一動機，也可說是外交上的動機。</p>
<p>本人雖非生於上海，但中學和大學敎育，都是在上海受的，對於上海社會發生親切的關係。基於此種立塔，則替上海社會做些工作，實本人所願為，所以毅然參加地方行政工作。這一動機，可謂為服務社會的動機。</p>
<p>本人自去年八月一日，參加第一區公署行政工作，其後一八兩區合併，繼續担任工作至今。不久前陳市長以政務繁忙，故以兼署長一職，命本人担任。蓋自去年至今，本人對於地方行政事務，已有難於擺脫之勢。最近市政府秘書長職務，亦委本人兼任，本人乃由普通外交官一變而為上海地方官。地方官的職務，乃替地方服務，而受上級機關及上級長官的指導，本人既允担任斯職，自當依此目標繼續服務，協助陳巿長完成大上海的建設計劃。</p>
<p>不過，上海的社會複雜，上海的地位重要，此層剛才陳先生已詳言之，今後本人處理一般行政，將本三大原則：</p>
<p>處理行政最重要的是中日現地當局的通力合作，以解決一切問題。關於此點，凡是盟方面會與本人接觸過的，都知道本人對於每一問題，必先以理智去研究淸楚，然後共同商量。我們討論問題，頭腦冷靜而心地熱烈，是則是，非則非，推誠合作，絕不推諉，這種誠懇協力的精神，本人一定要貫澈始終。</p>
<p>上海社會是由各方面組織而成，所謂政治經濟文化的交合，勢非各方面合作不可。誠如剛才陳先生所說，政治不過其中的一端，要推動整個的工作，有賴乎地方人民與政府密切協力。於此，本人不但請求聞蘭亭先生，張一鵬部長，及地方各前輩不吝時時賜敎，並盼新聞界，對於市政應興應革之處，用書面或通訊加以督促，使對每一問題，加以注意。</p>
<p>除此兩點以外，行政方面最值注意者，乃為「統一」與「簡單」，今後如何使不統一而變成統一，如何使複雜變為簡單，這也是處理行政的重要原則。</p>
<p>本人雖屬外交官，但並不畏於辭令，但願實事求是，逐步進行，做一步是一步，以薄弱的能力，為上海服務，對中日關係，如能略具貢獻，則幸甚焉。</p>
<p>熊處長詞　　諸位先生：今天承四團體招待，非常感激，本人此次奉令担任上海保安處長與淸鄕事務局職務，這兩種職務名義是兩個，機關是兩個，但實際的任務祗有一個，就是確立上海治安。換句話說，要是保安隊能健全，淸鄕事務局能健全，上海的治安就能够確立，不然，就不能達到這個目的所以本人的責任非常重大，而本人的能力又非常薄弱，以薄弱的能力，來担任重大的責任，實在非常擔心。</p>
<p>木人在這次接事時，曾對工作同志發表四點意見，第一，人事方面，絕對以人才主義來處理。第二，經濟方面，絕對以公開態度來處理。第三，以後決盡一切力量來肅清肅汚。第四，我們的同志間要每時每刻顧慮到「民衆」兩個字。一與二是內部問題，三與四是對外問題，不過這四點我雖在接事安隊健全，使淸鄕事務同健全，還是一個疑問。　　因為保安隊是各種的份子編成，他們的程度不致，所以耍改良保安隊唯一的法子，第一是革新現在的保安隊。第二是再造保安隊。</p>
<p>因為中國向來是募兵制，犯的毛病不是素實的不良，而是服務的時間為久，至多服役了三年，便云活動班長或排長了，有這一種弱點，必須以征兵制方法來再選保安隊。上海有一二十歲的靑年，如得各界協力保送二千，訓練半年，服勤半年，一年以後退伍，然後再召第二批，更當用征兵制的方法來改造保安隊，才能達到確立治安的目的。上海的治安必須以上海人來祖任，所以我以為如果要造成良好的保安隊，必須以征兵制方面來再造保安隊。</p>
<p>第二淸鄕事務局最重要的是封鎖管理局，直屬於淸鄕事務局的檢問所，有六七十個，每個十人，共有六七百人，但檢問所的經常費很少，平均支配，當然很難維持生活，所以現在淸鄕事務局，對於封鎖管理局應如何着手，實非常担心，本人是一個軍人，不會談話，今天很願意在座各位，以歡迎的心變為如何來督促的心，尤其是新聞界，能够在興論方面，多多批評督促。</p>
<p>船津理事長詞</p>
<p>今天四團體歡迎新任吳秘書長及熊處長，各位高論，業巳傾聽。茲以上海工商聯誼會一份子資格，略述數言。最近各方面對於推行廉潔政治的呼聲，甚囂塵上，廉潔政治乃任何國家所需要，廉潔兩字的天經地義，實無重申之必要。不過廉潔政治，並非口頭笨端的工作，必須求其實踐，如標榜廉潔之名，而不行廉潔之實，是不對的。再者，高唱廉潔，勸人廉潔，也不中用，必須躬行實踐。舉一個現實的例子，如在座的張部長，他才是模範官吏，躬行實錢，如果每一個官吏，都像張部長廉潔，則變為地方官，乃是謙虛之詞，吳秘盡長的政績，在第一區公署任內，早有定民政府在政治方面，最令人滿意的，便是起用張一鵬先生任司法部長，同時起用吳頌皐先生任第一區公署署長兼巿政府秘書長。上海社會複雜，所謂五方雜處，故地方官一職，必須由幹才担任，今吳秘長以其外交傑出人才，處理地方行政，必能大展宏圖，本人深為上海前途慶幸。至於熊劍東先生之出任保安處長兼淸鄕事務局長，亦係適所適才之舉。關於出任斯職的意義，熊先生已解釋淸楚，本人過去對於保安隊，亦曾從事調查及研究甚久，但因進行困難，雖經多方努力，終未獲得滿意的成績。要之，保安隊無論如何必須好好予以訓練，俾治安得以維持。剛才陳彬　先生說，上海為政洽經濟文化的中心，所以革新應從上海着手，本人見解相同，上海可以發生領導作用，其一舉一動，可以影響各地。所以要復興一切建設，必先確立治安，治安不確立，建設無由興起，故確立治安，為一切的先決問題。治安之重要如此，則擔任治安之人才，自非鄭重考慮不可。此次由熊先生出而擔任，眞是適才適所，殊為欽佩，同時這也是人事問題健全的表現。今天我們乘歡迎會之際，希望吳秘書長熊處長，今後加倍努力，多多為地方盡力，完成使命。</p>

<p>— Chen Bin He</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the four groups of the City Industry and Commerce Association, the Citizens Welfare Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the News Federation held a joint tea party to welcome the newly appointed Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Mr. Wu Songxing, and Director of Security, Mr. Xiong Jiandong. Bin He participated in the event and gave a brief speech. I am now writing down the following notes:</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's largest city, with a population of five million, and it is the center of the economy. Most of the country's production power is concentrated here, and most of the country's trade and commerce gather here. Objectively, it should generate great power and play a leading role. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the war, Shanghai has not exerted its great power or played a leading role in contributing to the war. On the contrary, at times all forces are dispersed and wasted. Why? It is undeniable that the central reason is the lack of a strong political measurement. Because political power is the core. When the core is strong, the surrounding dependencies will naturally be strong. When both the core and the surroundings are strong, the overall great power will naturally emerge. In other words, if there is a strong political power as the center, and various forces are concentrated, then great power can be generated. If there is no strong political power as the center, various forces will tend to disperse. After dispersion, they will each go on abnormal paths. Taking Shanghai's economy as an example, a review reveals speculation, hoarding, wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, rising prices, shrinking production, and the salary class's living conditions becoming increasingly difficult. These are all detrimental to the country and society without any benefit. This is an example of Shanghai's lack of a strong political force, an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Therefore, our first requirement is that Shanghai must have a strong political power as the center to concentrate economic, cultural, and other forces to generate overall great power. The promotion of a so-called strong political force can be discussed in two aspects. First, the highest administrative organ, the municipal government, must improve its personnel. We deeply admire Mayor Chen's talent and prestige. Recently, Mr. Wu Songxing was appointed as the Director of the First District Office and Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Mr. Xiong Jiandong was appointed as the Director of Security and Director of the Rural Clearing Affairs Bureau. We believe that the appointment of Mr. Wu and Mr. Xiong, with their talents, to assume key leadership positions is the municipal government's determination to improve its personnel, and we are very satisfied and grateful. However, the municipal government should further review whether the personnel of the directly affiliated agencies are sound. If the personnel of the entire municipal government are not completely sound, then the overall administrative efficiency and administrative facilities will still be a problem, and a strong political force will still be out of reach. Second, during this decisive period, Shanghai, an important base in the rear, the various departments of the municipal government bear important responsibilities. It is not enough to passively ensure that individuals do not do bad things and that their personal reputations are not damaged. At the same time, they must have the courage and resolve to actively overcome all difficulties and eliminate all wartime abnormalities. In particular, we expect Mr. Wu and Mr. Xiong to lead by example and take the lead in pioneering this. Furthermore, the power of the government's few people is certainly not enough. It must be coupled with the full cooperation of the people. The people must have the opportunity to participate in politics, and all policies and decrees must first be widely understood by the people. Therefore, a true organ of public opinion is urgently needed. In this way, Shanghai can be made a model area of Chinese politics and a model area for contributing to the war effort. Furthermore, it can be made a model area for Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding Sino-Japanese cooperation, according to the current situation, it is far from the goal of a model area. Whether it is in terms of cooperative undertakings or the feelings of both sides, the goal of a model area has not been achieved. It is hoped that in the future, all unreasonable phenomena that hinder the cooperation of both sides should be reflected upon and reformed by both China and Japan. All undertakings that can increase the feelings of both sides, or production undertakings, or undertakings that are beneficial to the war, should be continuously worked on and sincerely cooperated on by both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Establishing a strong political force as the center, coordinating economic forces, Sino-Japanese cooperation, making it a model area of Chinese politics, and a model area of Sino-Japanese cooperation. At this crucial juncture of the decisive battle, we cannot afford to be passive and mistaken! We cannot afford to be slack and negligent! If Shanghai cannot build a strong political force, then there is no point in talking about the political power of the whole of China. If China cannot build a strong political force, then there is no point in talking about actually contributing to the war!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Westward on the Dimapur-Imphal Road; Enemy Troops in Imphal Are Being Encircled and Annihilated <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Front Line on the Indo-Burmese Border, 6th: The enemy forces north of Tonzang and northwest of Dimapur have collapsed and retreated. Currently, Japanese and Indian troops are advancing northward on the road from Tonzang to Imphal, and a unit of Japanese and Indian troops has begun to advance westward on the road from Dimapur to Palel. The enemy's base, Imphal, is being surrounded from all sides, and a war of annihilation is currently being launched against the main force of the enemy's Fourth Army, the three divisions. The main force of the enemy's 37th Brigade of the 23rd Division and several thousand remnants of the 17th Division north of Tonzang have been retreating into the national border since the 1st, and the Japanese and Indian troops are attacking them. By the 3rd, a unit of Japanese and Indian troops had advanced 10 kilometers into Indian territory, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After the fall of Dimapur, one brigade of the enemy's 23rd Division and one brigade of the 23rd Division were also annihilated. As a result, the main force of the Japanese and Indian troops advanced from Dimapur, while another unit of Japanese and Indian troops cut off their retreat route. Since the 1st, they have continuously bombarded the defeated enemy northwest of Dimapur, and their motorcades and barracks and warehouses in Kiphima (18 miles northwest of Dimapur) have been set on fire. In addition, the Japanese and Indian commando units blocking the retreat route of the enemy forces northwest of Dimapur have attacked the enemy troops attempting to provide reinforcements and continue to attack Palel (located on the road from Dimapur to Imphal, the exit for Imphal and other places), the headquarters of the enemy's 20th Division. On the 3rd, they advanced to a position 10 kilometers east of Palel.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, a Base on the Indo-Burmese Border, 6th: Chikha, 7 kilometers south of the border, and the Tonzang-Imphal road are key points on the Indo-Burmese border, where the enemy has established a defensive line. However, it could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and has now collapsed. On the night of the 4th, the enemy set fire to the ammunition depot, and the fire was very intense. The ammunition depot experienced a series of large explosions, and the situation was extremely tragic. The various units of the Japanese army, with the force of raging waves, launched a rapid attack on Chikha. By dawn on the 5th, the Japanese army, under the cover of artillery fire, broke into a corner of the enemy's line, defeated the enemy's key points, and Chikha will soon fall.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Indian Chairman Bose Issues Another Statement Urging Indians to Jointly Strive for Independence <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 5th: The Provisional Government of India has been actively reviewing various administrative measures and gradually implementing them as the Free India area expands rapidly with the progress of the war. Chairman Jiangtela Bose issued a second statement on the 4th, emphasizing that Japan has no political, economic, or military ambitions towards India. The Provisional Government of India is the only legitimate government of the Indian people, and all enlightened Indians should abandon everything to join the Indian National Army to jointly strive for the freedom and independence of their motherland. The full text is recorded as follows: Gentlemen, the Provisional Government of Free India, based on the general will of the three million Indians in East Asia, established the Indian National Army in Chao Nan on October 21, 1943. Under the command of the Provisional Government, it has broken through the border and penetrated deep into Indian territory. The Provisional Government of Free India is your own government, so we must complete a major mission, which is to use force to drive the British and Americans out of the sacred land of India and establish a permanent free Indian national government based on the will of the Indian people. The Provisional Government of Free India will continue the armed struggle until it defeats the British and American forces and drives them out of India. At the same time, it will also engage in the construction of the liberated areas. The Provisional Government of Free India is the only legitimate government of India for the Indian people. The Provisional Government will provide the greatest assistance and cooperation to the Indian people in the liberated areas through the Indian National Army and the administrative officials appointed by the Provisional Government. The Provisional Government is the guarantor of the lives and property of the Indians in the liberated areas, so any act that is beneficial to the enemy British, Americans, and Allied forces or hinders the Provisional Government's great cause of reviving India will be severely punished. The Provisional Government sincerely hopes that the Indian people will fully cooperate with the Japanese army, our allies. The Japanese army is providing us with unlimited support in order to crush our enemies. In the past two years, the British army has strengthened its own forces with troops from India, America, Australia, and East and West Africa. In view of this, the Provisional Government accepted the good intentions of the Japanese army's support after the start of the Greater East Asia War, and believes that the Indian National Army, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, will be able to crush the British and American forces and achieve the complete liberation of India. The Provisional Government absolutely trusts Japan's attitude towards India, and believes that Japan has no political, economic, military, or territorial ambitions towards India. What Japan is concerned about is only the overthrow of the long-standing enemies of East Asia and the defeat of British and American aggression, so that this war can end and world peace can be realized. In order to have the conditions of an independent national government, the Provisional Government is now preparing to issue rupees in various denominations as India's own currency. However, in the past, due to the rapid development of the war situation, our army advanced into India, so the Provisional Government's preparation for issuing currency was not completed. Under this situation, the Provisional Government had no choice but to temporarily use the currency of the Japanese government as a temporary measure. Once the Provisional Government establishes its own currency, it will immediately recall the Japanese currency. Fellow compatriots, at this time when we are driving out the evil forces of the enemy from our own country, you should do what the citizens of Free India should do, join your own Provisional Government of Free India and the National Army, and jointly strive for the freedom and independence of your motherland.</p>

<h3 id="e7">German Foreign Minister Issues Statement Resolving to Defend Romania; Says Soviet Declaration is a Political Conspiracy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 6th: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop met with Futo, a special correspondent of the Romanian News Agency stationed in Berlin, and said that the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has become increasingly difficult because Britain and the United States cannot stop the Kremlin's policies. Regarding the reply to the correspondent's question, the German Foreign Minister pointed out that Britain and the United States have discovered that Moscow is now in a leading position, but Europe does not use the cracks between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to defeat the Soviet Union. The only way for Europe to win is to hope for the strength of the allied countries in Europe. The German Foreign Minister also refuted the enemy's rumors that the German army had abandoned Romania, and expressed that the German army's defense of Romania was as firm as its defense of Germany. Regarding the Soviet Union's statement that entering Romania was purely for military purposes, when asked for the Foreign Minister's opinion on this, he replied: Foreign Minister Molotov's declaration is not surprising to those who have paid attention to Soviet foreign policy for the past 25 years, because political conspiracies are often part of the Soviet strategy. When its military strength has exceeded its highest point, the Soviet Union often uses political tricks. The Germans believe that the reason why the Soviet Union is accelerating the use of current means is that after suffering terrible sacrifices last year, the Soviet Union is trying to end the current campaign at the least cost. The Soviets recalled that they had once been close to victory, but ended up being defeated. Therefore, they hope to reduce their risks as much as possible. This can also be explained by the Soviet Union's action of deceiving Finland with moderate ceasefire conditions. Its seduction of Bulgaria and promises to Romania are all intended for this purpose, but it is believed that every Romanian knows the value of Soviet promises. Regarding the British Prime Minister's remarks in the House of Commons that he was satisfied with Molotov's statement and that he had expressed the British government's satisfaction to the Kremlin, when asked for the German Foreign Minister's opinion on this, he replied: The explanation of this matter is very simple. This is an example of extreme hypocrisy. London has been able to experience the fact that Churchill cannot resist Stalin, and all are afraid that this matter will eventually become the misfortune of Britain. The opposition of the central people to Churchill's policy is gradually increasing its voice. The Soviet Foreign Minister's declaration is a good opportunity for Churchill to make a disguise. Churchill has sacrificed Finland, the three Baltic countries, Poland, and the Balkan countries to the Soviet Union. In fact, this is the sacrifice of Britain's traditional policy towards Europe. After Molotov issued the declaration, this gambler appeared in the House of Commons, disguising himself as a believing in the true meaning of the Soviet declaration to create the impression that Britain's interests were not threatened by the Soviet Union. When asked for the Foreign Minister's opinion on the situation in Romania after the Soviet army crossed the Romanian border, the German Foreign Minister replied: Romania is part of Europe, and the Soviet Union's threat to Romania is a threat to the whole of Europe. The defense of the Dniester River is the same as the defense of other strongholds in Europe. Regarding the rumors that the German army is willing to abandon Romania for strategic reasons, it is extremely ridiculous. This is similar to saying that the Germans will abandon Berlin. The Germans defend Romania in the same way as they resist the heavy air raids of Britain and the United States. The Soviet army's entry into Romania has strengthened the cooperation between the German and Romanian armies. The German army will defend Romanian territory until Romania regains its freedom and prevents Bolshevism from invading the Balkans.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Illegal Hoarding by Chongqing Officials and Merchants <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th: Chongqing has recently become more active in punishing corrupt officials and treacherous merchants. Since the National General Mobilization Conference was convened last year, all bank warehouses specializing in hoarding have been inspected. As a result, more than 1,000 cases of illegal activities have been reported. A Chongqing broadcast on the 3rd severely criticized the evil acts of hoarding and speculation, stating in essence that: more than 20 banks in Sichuan Province have a total of 152 warehouses. After inspection, 363 cases of illegal activities were found, involving the hoarding of materials worth more than 60 million yuan. More than 600 cases of illegal activities were found in the other nine provinces. Since most of the hoarded materials are valuable items, it is expected that the amount will also be very large. At this difficult time for the country, it is heartbreaking that there are so many illegal activities. Therefore, a military court should be convened to stop the trend of hoarding and speculation.</p>

Then, they frankly exchanged views on strengthening the friendship between China and Manchuria and strengthening the Sino-Japanese-Manchurian axis. The banquet ended happily at around 11:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Chongqing's Melancholy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— By a Contemporary</p>
<p>A week ago, Japan and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on extending the fisheries treaty for five years and transferring rights to oil and coal resources on Sakhalin Island. This resolved a long-standing issue, and the friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union were fully manifested through these economic measures. The stability of the northeastern part of Asia was further ensured, which is a well-known fact. Prominent Soviet newspapers, Izvestia and Pravda, each published an editorial on this matter. In their conclusions, they pointed out that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union was a manifestation of their amicable relations, and emphasized that the friendly relations between the two countries would become even closer. However, the most affected were, of course, Britain, America, and Chongqing. They selectively quoted Soviet newspaper editorials, deliberately distorting the facts, claiming that the agreement was merely a unilateral diplomatic victory for the Soviet Union, or that it indicated Japan's weakening position, using this to conceal their embarrassment and console themselves.</p>
<p>Internally Filled with Contradictions</p>
<p>The enemy's comical propaganda was inconsistent in its tone. Chongqing, four days after the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet negotiations, also broadcast a special report in Russian, following the tone of Britain and America, without much originality. However, two points seemed particularly important. Chongqing, humbly speaking of the Japan-Soviet agreement, said, "This gives Japan some hope before the Allied forces launch an offensive," acknowledging that Japan's position had been strengthened. They also specifically stated, "This matter requires full understanding among the United Nations," seemingly expressing a hint of resentment towards the Soviet Union for not fully informing the United Nations in advance. The Chongqing-based special correspondent for an American newspaper, Ober, broadcast on Chongqing radio on the 4th, saying that the Japan-Soviet agreement increased Chongqing's military threat from Japan and shattered hopes of enlisting Soviet participation in the war against Japan. These words depicted Chongqing's internal melancholy. In short, Chongqing is also an Asian nation, and they also hope to stabilize Asia. However, they feel melancholy because the Japan-Soviet agreement promotes stability in Northeast Asia. This is Chongqing's greatest contradiction. It is not impossible for Chongqing to escape this contradiction, but unfortunately, the path to escaping this contradiction is deliberately obscured by Chongqing's leaders, who suppress the light of the people.</p>
<p>The day after the news of the Japan-Soviet agreement was released, a Moscow newspaper stated, "This is another worry for Chongqing," and published a report from a TASS correspondent in Ulan Bator about Chongqing's troops violating the borders of the Mongolian People's Republic in Xinjiang Province. The correspondent also stated that the Mongolian People's Republic government was established under the 1936 mutual assistance treaty, and if violations of the border by Chongqing's troops continue, it is believed that the Soviet Union will provide all necessary assistance to the Mongolian government.</p>
<p>Centralization of Xinjiang</p>
<p>Everyone knows that TASS is a purely Soviet state organ, and its reports are much more detailed and important than the irresponsible news from the American Associated Press and United Press. Therefore, the TASS report made Chongqing even more embarrassed. Furthermore, Chongqing has continuously promoted the "centralization" of Xinjiang Province. Sheng Shicai, the chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, has now been appointed Deputy Commander of the Eighth War Zone, and a Kuomintang branch has been established. At the very least, it can be said that a large part of its bureaucratic structure is controlled by Chongqing. Therefore, the border conflicts can also be seen as conflicts between the Soviet Union's proxy, the Mongolian People's Republic, and Chongqing. Chongqing remains silent about this internally, and externally claims, "The reported details do not conform to the facts," or says, "Outer Mongolia is part of China, and the Soviet Union should not interfere," even using "there is no factual basis" to dismiss everything. The Moscow government has remained silent on this matter so far, but Chongqing's worries and anxieties are increasing day by day. In addition, it utilizes the Chinese Communist Party for the war of resistance against Japan, but on the other hand, it fears the growing influence of the CCP, so it constantly attacks them politically and militarily. In this situation, Chongqing is surrounded by the constraints created by the relations between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, the relations between the Soviet Union and China, and the friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Its only hope lies in relying on the United States, dreaming that the results of the Cairo Conference will be realized. However, in fact, the United States also believes that it is better to abandon Chongqing and utilize the CCP for the war against Japan. For example, the American "New Republic" weekly openly advocated supporting the CCP military in an editorial, believing that the CCP's political and military strength is more effective than Chongqing's in stabilizing Asia. If this is indeed the case, where will Chongqing go? The harsh reality has gradually shattered the opium-induced dreams made of American goods.</p>
<h3 id="e12">German Garrison in Kovel, Poland, Relieved; Situation in Carpathians Also Improves <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced: The German garrison in the former Polish city of Kovel, although surrounded by Soviet forces with several times their strength, was still able to demonstrate their firm fighting spirit and hinder the Soviet advance. German armored forces northwest of the city, under air cover, launched a fierce attack and successfully rescued the German garrison in Kovel. The area around the city has now returned to the German defensive line.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the military correspondent Colonel Orpe of the DNB (German News Bureau): Due to the heavy rain turning into blizzards on the Eastern Front and the German authorities' counterattacks, the enemy's offensive on the Eastern Front has greatly weakened in recent days. Therefore, reinforcements for the German forces in the Carpathian Mountains and Bessarabia have been able to proceed quickly, without needing to transfer reserves from Western Europe. In addition, on the entire front of the Prut River, the Hungarian army is fighting shoulder to shoulder with the German army, repelling the Soviet offensive. North of Odessa, the enemy's attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. The Soviet army has only penetrated German positions in the Raszjejnaje area; attacks by the enemy in other areas have been blocked, especially in the lower reaches of the Dnieper River. The German withdrawal along the Black Sea coast was not disturbed. The enemy advancing from Balti towards Chisinau has not yet been able to cut the railway from Iasi to Tiraspol. German and Romanian troops are fighting together in this area. Soviet crossings of the Prut River north of Iasi have been repelled by German aircraft. West of Cernauti, large German forces have been fighting for many days and have reached the west bank of the Dniester River from the north. At the foot of the Carpathian Mountains, the German army has been able to stop the enemy's southward advance, and the situation is gradually improving. On the northern wing, German forces in Brody and Kovel have begun counterattacks. The enemy has been repelled south and northeast of Brody, and German forces have occupied large areas northeast of Kovel. On the central front, large-scale enemy offensives in Vitebsk, Orsha, and Drutsk have been blocked. On the northern front, the enemy is preparing for a large-scale breakthrough towards the Baltic Sea, and large forces have been attacking Pskov fiercely. There, enemy forces are concentrating in large numbers.</p>

Now, I would like to invite Mr. Chen Binsu to deliver a welcoming speech on behalf of the group. (The original text can be found in today's editorial in this newspaper.)</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Speech</p>
<p>I am very grateful for the joint tea party hosted today by the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Association, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the Press Association. I just heard Mr. Chen Binsu's words, which, from my personal perspective, are of great significance. These valuable opinions can serve not only the government authorities but also the general public.</p>
<p>The importance of Shanghai's position has just been explained by Mr. Chen. I would now like to briefly report on my involvement in Shanghai's local administration.</p>
<p>I have served in the diplomatic field for many years, as is well known to my friends, but there are motivations and reasons for my gradual transition from a diplomat to a local official. In March of last year, our ally Japan decided to return the exclusive concession to China and decided to assist China in recovering other concessions. I believe that the purpose of the Chinese national revolution is to seek freedom and independence. The reason why China has not been able to achieve freedom and independence is due to many factors, but the constraints of unequal treaties are the main reason. If the concessions are not recovered for even a single day, China cannot achieve freedom and independence for a single day. At that time, I was ordered by Chairman Wang to participate in the committees for accepting the concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. The reason I participated in these two tasks was because I felt that after the recovery of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights, at least the demands of the people for the past twenty years would be adequately satisfied. Therefore, after the signing of the agreement for the return of the concessions, I went to Hankou in March of last year to take over the concession. In May, I was assigned to Tianjin to take over the French exclusive concession. In mid-July, our allies decided to assist China in returning the Shanghai International Settlement, and at the same time, the French authorities also made a similar statement, returning the Shanghai French Concession. Later, I also participated in the signing of the return agreement. After the return of the International Settlement, new institutions were organized to handle the administration of the former International Settlement. At that time, Mayor Chen hoped that I would help and serve as the Chief Secretary. I was willing to take on this role for two reasons:</p>
<p>I know very well that Japan's return of the concessions to China is a manifestation of its new policy towards China, and the purpose of the new policy is to gradually support China in achieving freedom and independence during the war. I feel that since our allies have such good intentions, we should cater to these good intentions. Therefore, I devoted myself to receiving the International Settlement and establishing a new administrative agency, namely the First District Public Office, to manage the administrative affairs under the jurisdiction of the former Shanghai Municipal Council. This motivation can also be said to be a diplomatic motivation.</p>
<p>Although I was not born in Shanghai, I received my secondary and university education in Shanghai, and I have a close relationship with Shanghai society. Based on this standpoint, it is my wish to do some work for Shanghai society, so I resolutely participated in local administrative work. This motivation can be said to be a motivation to serve society.</p>
<p>I have been involved in the administrative work of the First District Public Office since August 1st of last year. Later, the First and Second Districts were merged, and I continued to work until now. Not long ago, Mayor Chen, due to his busy schedule, appointed me to concurrently serve as the Director. Since last year, I have found it difficult to extricate myself from local administrative affairs. Recently, I was also appointed to concurrently serve as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and I have transformed from an ordinary diplomat to a Shanghai local official. The duty of a local official is to serve the local area and to receive guidance from superior agencies and superior officials. Since I have agreed to take on this position, I will continue to serve according to this goal and assist Mayor Chen in completing the construction plan of Greater Shanghai.</p>
<p>However, Shanghai's society is complex, and Shanghai's position is important. Mr. Chen has already explained this in detail. In the future, I will handle general administration based on three major principles:</p>
<p>The most important thing in handling administration is the full cooperation between the local authorities of China and Japan to solve all problems. Regarding this point, anyone from the Allied side who has been in contact with me knows that I will first study each problem clearly with reason and then discuss it together. We discuss problems with a cool head and a warm heart, right is right, wrong is wrong, and we cooperate sincerely without shirking responsibility. I will definitely implement this spirit of sincere cooperation from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Shanghai society is composed of various aspects, the so-called combination of politics, economy, and culture, and cooperation from all aspects is essential. As Mr. Chen just said, politics is only one aspect of it. To promote the entire work, we rely on the close cooperation between the local people and the government. In this regard, I not only ask Mr. Wen Lanting, Minister Zhang Yipeng, and local seniors to provide guidance at any time, but also hope that the press will use written or written communications to urge the municipal administration to improve and reform, so that each problem can be paid attention to.</p>
<p>In addition to these two points, the most noteworthy aspects of administration are "unity" and "simplicity". How to turn disunity into unity and how to turn complexity into simplicity is also an important principle for handling administration.</p>
<p>Although I am a diplomat, I am not afraid of rhetoric. I only hope to be practical and progressive, taking one step at a time and doing one step at a time. I will serve Shanghai with my limited ability, and I would be very fortunate if I can make a slight contribution to the relationship between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Director Xiong's Speech</p>
<p>Gentlemen, I am very grateful for the reception held by the four organizations today. I have been ordered to serve as the Director of the Shanghai Security Bureau and the Director of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau. These two positions have two names and two agencies, but in reality, they have only one task, which is to establish Shanghai's security. In other words, if the security team can be sound and the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau can be sound, Shanghai's security can be established. Otherwise, this goal cannot be achieved. Therefore, my responsibility is very heavy, and my ability is very weak. I am very worried about taking on such a heavy responsibility with such a weak ability.</p>
<p>When I took over this position, I expressed four opinions to my colleagues. First, in terms of personnel, we will absolutely handle matters based on talent. Second, in terms of finance, we will absolutely handle matters with an open attitude. Third, we will do our best to eliminate corruption in the future. Fourth, our colleagues must always consider the two words "the people". One and two are internal problems, and three and four are external problems. However, even if I have taken over, whether the security team is sound and the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is sound is still a question. Because the security team is composed of various elements, their levels are inconsistent. Therefore, the only way to improve the security team is to first reform the current security team and second, to rebuild the security team.</p>
<p>Because China has always had a conscription system, the problem is not that the quality is poor, but that the service time is too long. At most, after serving for three years, they become activity leaders or platoon leaders. With this weakness, we must use a conscription system to re-select the security team. If we can get the cooperation of all sectors to recommend two thousand young people in their twenties in Shanghai, train them for half a year, and have them serve for half a year, then after one year, they can retire. Then we can recall the second batch and use the conscription system to transform the security team in order to achieve the goal of establishing security. Shanghai's security must be established by Shanghai people. Therefore, I believe that if we want to create a good security team, we must rebuild the security team using a conscription system.</p>
<p>Second, the most important part of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is the blockade management bureau. There are sixty or seventy inspection stations directly under the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau, with ten people in each station, totaling six or seven hundred people. However, the operating expenses of the inspection stations are very low. With an average distribution, it is naturally difficult to maintain a livelihood. Therefore, the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau is very worried about how to proceed with the blockade management bureau. I am a soldier, and I am not good at talking. Today, I would like to ask everyone present to change your welcoming hearts into hearts that urge and supervise us. In particular, I hope that the press can provide more criticism and supervision in terms of public opinion.</p>
<p>Chairman Funatsu's Speech</p>
<p>Today, the four organizations welcome the new Secretary-General Wu and Director Xiong. We have listened to your high-level speeches. Now, as a member of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Association, I would like to say a few words. Recently, there has been a lot of noise from all sides about promoting clean government. Clean government is needed by any country. The principle of integrity is self-evident, and there is no need to reiterate it. However, clean government is not a work of lip service; it must be put into practice. It is wrong to promote the name of integrity without actually practicing it. Furthermore, it is useless to sing about integrity and persuade people to be honest. We must practice what we preach. To give a realistic example, Minister Zhang, who is present, is a model official who practices what he preaches. If every official were as clean as Minister Zhang, then becoming a local official would be a humble statement. Secretary Wu's achievements during his tenure in the First District Public Office were already well-received by the people. One of the most satisfying things that the new government has done in the political field is to appoint Mr. Zhang Yipeng as the Minister of Justice and Mr. Wu Songgao as the Director of the First District Public Office and concurrently as the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government. Shanghai society is complex, with so-called people from all over the world living here. Therefore, the position of local official must be held by talented people. Now that Secretary Wu is using his outstanding diplomatic talents to handle local administration, he will surely achieve great things. I am deeply grateful for the future of Shanghai. As for Mr. Xiong Jiandong's appointment as the Director of the Security Bureau and concurrently as the Director of the Clearing and Settling Affairs Bureau, it is also a fitting and talented move. Mr. Xiong has already explained the significance of taking on this position clearly. In the past, I have also been involved in investigating and researching the security team for a long time, but due to difficulties in progress, despite many efforts, I have not achieved satisfactory results. In short, the security team must be well-trained in any case so that security can be maintained. Mr. Chen Binsu just said that Shanghai is the center of political, economic, and cultural affairs, so reforms should start in Shanghai. I agree with his opinion. Shanghai can play a leading role, and its actions can affect other places. Therefore, to revive all construction, we must first establish security. If security is not established, construction cannot be started. Therefore, establishing security is a prerequisite for everything. Since security is so important, the talents who are responsible for security must be carefully considered. This time, Mr. Xiong has been appointed to take on this role, which is truly a fitting and talented move, and I admire him very much. At the same time, this is also a manifestation of a sound personnel problem. Today, on the occasion of this welcoming meeting, we hope that Secretary Wu and Director Xiong will redouble their efforts in the future, do their best for the local area, and fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>The President of This Newspaper Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>The two words "Domei" symbolize the alliance between China and Japan, and the alliance between the countries of East Asia. We are working together for the Greater East Asia War and working together for the liberation of Greater East Asia. The Domei News Agency has a long history and a large scale, and it is well-suited to undertake the task of spreading news between the Allied countries and reporting on the movements between the Allied countries, and it is worthy of the name "Domei". Today, we bid farewell to Mr. Iwamoto and welcome Mr. Sasaki at the same time. Both gentlemen are the backbone of the Domei News Agency, and we hope that the strength of both gentlemen will promote the alliance power of our press.</p>
<p>Director Iwamoto Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>I have served at the Domei News Agency for eighteen years. In the past two years, I have come to serve in China. I am very grateful for the guidance and cooperation of my Chinese press colleagues. Recently, I have been transferred back to the headquarters to serve. I am willing to always remember the experience and lessons I have learned in the past two years and continue to serve. At the same time, I hope to come to China again in the future to meet with you all.</p>
<p>Director Sasaki's Speech</p>
<p>I have served in China and Manchuria for over twenty years. This time, I have been ordered to come to Shanghai, and I am very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with the Shanghai press. In the future, I hope to have more guidance and support so that I can fulfill my duties. Due to the limited time today, I will simply state my wishes and hope to have your guidance.</p>

<p>The permanent lighting restrictions implemented in this city since the 3rd of last month have led to increased activity by small thieves, which has affected social security. The Baojia authorities in the seven districts of Huangpu, Lao Zha, Putuo, Chengdu, Xin Zha, Jiangning, and Jing'an Temple in the First District are quite concerned and have jointly sent a letter to the First Police Bureau requesting improvements. After the bureau consulted with the air defense authorities and improved street lighting, theft cases have decreased sharply in all districts of the city.

<p>To ensure the food supply for civilians and the military, the Rice Control Association has been vigorously promoting the purchasing efforts by issuing material coupons. It is reported that the Association is now offering procurement merchants in all areas an additional 10% in material coupons (for a total of 30%) for those who deliver rice according to the purchase orders between February 23rd and April 10th, to encourage them. However, regarding how to deal with some procurement merchants who have already received loans but have failed to deliver rice according to the purchase orders, or even have not delivered a single grain of rice, the Association has not yet made any decisions. The reporter, therefore, specifically visited the Association to inquire in detail. The response was: "The standard for distributing materials by this Association is based on the purchase orders made by each procurement merchant. Those who delivered in full before February 23rd are given 20%. However, those who can deliver in full between February 23rd and April 10th will receive an additional 10%. This is to adapt to the objective environment and to encourage procurement. The situation has been quite good. Most of the procurement merchants in various areas have been able to deliver on schedule according to the orders, but there are also some who have only delivered a portion. The Association will strictly urge these procurement merchants to deliver. As for those who have not delivered a single grain of rice, the Association will immediately request the government's assistance to severely punish them without leniency."</p>
