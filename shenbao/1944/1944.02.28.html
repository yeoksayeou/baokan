<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">革新第一　重申我們的態度 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近來有人歪曲我們言論的態度，我們對於囿於一時的情感，片面的利害觀念的推論，認爲不屑，也不値駁斥。不過，爲嚴正我們的立塲，認爲有重申立論態度的必要。爲便於說明我們貫的言論態引述數段過去的文字。</p>
<p>去年四月廿四日本報社評，題爲「一面擁護，一面督促」，曾說：「反對和平運動者，歸納有三種，第一是重慶政權；第二是共產黨；第三是和平運動中的失敗主義者動搖份子，他們一方面參加和平運動，作爲掩護；一方面製造種種阻碍和平運動的事實，以阻撓和運的進展，他們掛了參加和運的招牌，而行其混水撈魚的勾當。……自從月九國民政府對英美宣戰以後……，政府的責任旣重一層。而政府的舉動更與人民有密切關係。政府的事，就是人民的事，人民的事，也是政府的事。政府的措施，以人民爲前提，這措施才能發揮總力。……為了造成政府與人民一體，才能發揮總力。……為了造成政府與人民一體的力景，我們就需要一面擁護政府唯恐不誠；一面督促政府唯恐不嚴。我們輿論界的責任，是在溝通政府和人民的意見，一面宣示政府意旨，以吿人民；一面傳達人民公意，以聞政府。我們發為主張，無非本於人民大衆的意見。如果以為我們主張了「改善政治機構」，「修明政治」，「刷新人事」，以及種種政治的，經濟的，社會的改革　言，是在反對政府，這種觀念實在要不得的。……惟有眞正敢進諍言者，才是眞正擁護政府者；也惟有眞正敢於督促政府的人民，才是愛護國家的現代公民。我們更不辭繁複的提出：「一面擁護政府，唯恐不嚴。」以為一般曲解「擁護」與「反對」者告。」這篇社評的發表，距今已達十閱月。</p>
<p>去年十二月九日本報代論，題爲「我們的態度」，曾說：「　我們對於時局的態度，擁護南京國民政府和平政策及國策。同時，協力盟邦完成大東亞戰爭勝利，以最近大東亞　　　　　　東亞宣言為最高理想。　我們立言的態度，悉　民意為依歸，民為國本，國家原是人民的集體。人民愛國之心，激發初非難事，且可說是與生俱來。其發揚與否以及程度若何？質直言之，當國者苟重視民意而愛護人民，則人民安有不愛護政府愛護國家者，我們本於此義，對於民意絕對重視，立論根據民意，表達民意，雖因此而對政府主張革新政治，不無率直之處，亦所不計，我們認爲這種態度是對政府最摯誠的表示。因爲，在今天的時代，虛偽的歌功頌德，是我們所願說，料也不為賢明當局所願聽的。」這篇代論的發表，距今將及三閱月。</p>
<p>上面引述的，可以具體說明我們一年以來的立論態度。是否「不惜對政府吹毛求疵」？是否「要使人民與政府分離，甚至對立」？「是否要傾覆政府」？我想雖然婦人孺子稍明是非的也決不會歪曲吧！</p>
<p>現在是什麽時代？大家知道是在大東亞戰爭的決戰關頭早就應該以眞實力量協同實踐參戰。我們試加反省參戰年餘來，盡了些什麽力量，文字多呢？言語多呢還是實力多呢？當前中國的處境很爲困難有重慶依賴英美，負嵎拖戰，分化國力。有中共利用重慶拖戰及政治不良，膨脹蔓延其力量，成爲東亞惟的未來大患而和平區內，是否政治已上軌道，經濟已無危機，和平信念與參戰信念能否堅定民生問題是否逐漸改善抑是漸趨嚴重？請解除有色眼鏡，睜開大眼張望吧中國目前處境，實已臨到最大危機的邊緣了。如果再不切實挽救，而一味推諉於戰時不可避免的困難，那末，前途危機發於旦，寗堪設想譬如說，舊曆年前年後，個月中一般物價狂昇倍蓰尤以白米黑市漲得驚人，這與民生關係何等重大的畸形現象，而束手無策，豈可完全推諉於戰時不可避免的困難呢？</p>
<p>危機瀕此嚴重地步，當然不是政府方面的過失人民自也有半的責任現社會的姿態滿着投機取巧騎牆模稜的氣氛只知小我的私利，不顧大衆的公益投機取巧的現象愈深刻化國民道德就愈趨墮落，而公利十念愈淡薄，犧牲精神就愈湮沒這種現象的形成政府與人民應共同負責。這種現象形成的因素在於介乎官民之間的有力者創始於上民間狡點者倣效於下，政府不施權力制止，般人民敢怒而不敢言於是愈演愈劣愈演愈惡所可惜者，中國還未建立民意機機，人民除在與諭方面表達意見之外，更無其他方法促起政府注意，盼望政府改善。</p>
<p>自古的政治家，也可說是執政當局，一定具有勇於反省的精神，具有勇於革新的精神，具有民飢己飢民溺己溺的心意，而謀民生改善，這個政府才有明朗的前途一個政府的當政者，個個都是忠誠爲國，爲民生謀改善，人民自然樂於忍受痛苦犧牲切盟邦日本是個很好的例他們有議會，有大政翼贊會，盡量聽取人民意見，政府與人民眞正同甘共苦，官吏無利用地位混水撈魚，入民自無怨望，醫如日本雖皇室及元老重臣子弟同樣應徵兵役開往前綫，而中國要人的兒子竟在上海狂歡賭博跳舞日本任用官吏，必問其才幹使能稱職。而中國則有流氓常警官，不肖的黨政人員尅扣軍糧等難道也是戰時不可避免的困難呢？雖然我們的政府中也有潔身自好奉守法的官吏，可是，總覺未曾普遍，比數太少。</p>
<p>總之，我們反對重慶拖戰從爭取民心入手，希望有一天共同參加大東亞建設。反對共產黨陰謀破壞，從政治革新人手加强消滅共黨的力量。反對英美侵略東亞，從培養實力入手，協力盟邦爭取戰爭勝利。反對和平陣營中的動搖分子失敗主義者肅淸投機取巧，堅定和平信念。</p>
<p>我們的態度，已如上述擁護政府不後於人而我們最應擁護，是革新政治，我們認爲爭取勝利第一、是一個隔水的遠景，而革新政治是一座橋，必先架就橋樑才能渡水而接受遠景政治如不革新，而侈言爭取勝利責無異在夢中懷想遠景而已我們將肯定的說，革新第一！革新第一！</p>

<p>高石會長致詞</p>
<p>剛才主席的誇獎，實不敢當。主席說日本與中國的新聞事業比較，處於兄與弟的地位，但我認為誰是兄誰是弟，很難區別。不過，旣然有兄和弟的密切關係，彼此之間，就不能分開。在席諸君中，有往日本出席過新聞大會，或文學大會的，已經見面過，聽說回國後均讚許日本地方美麗，其實我們看中國地方同樣是美麗。中日兩國在地理上最為接近。是緊密的鄰居，彼此需要聯繫，可說是命運所定，並非勉强。我抱具一種志願，就是我們不容許歐美人揷足，我們東亞人自己創造東　人的東亞。這個理想，猶之建築房屋，必須大家齊心協力，始克奠基立礎以底成屋。我們新聞界的力量非常重要，應該共同向此理想邁進。日本對華政策，每一個國民都瞭解，同時也都認識中國情形，因此更覺得有協力創造大東亞的必要。此外，我更　想到為了戰爭若干地方不便，可是，不必因而担憂，憑我們協同的力量，足够爭取勝利，實現我們的理想。爲期兩國新聞界更加親善。借主人杯酒祝彼此　結，諸位健康。致詞畢宴會開始，席間高石會長，松平部長及本報陳社長等交換新聞事業技術方面種種意見，備極歡洽，今日中午十二時，本報假日華俱樂部備節約菜招待。</p>

<h3 id="e1">INNOVATION FIRST: REITERATING OUR STANCE <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, some have distorted our stance in our commentary. We consider it beneath us and not worth refuting arguments based on temporary emotions and one-sided notions of self-interest. However, to affirm our position solemnly, we believe it is necessary to reiterate our stance. To facilitate understanding of our consistent commentary, we cite several passages from past writings.</p>
<p>In our editorial on April 24th of last year, titled "Supporting on One Hand, Urging on the Other," we said: "There are three types of those who oppose the peace movement. The first is the Chongqing regime; the second is the Communist Party; and the third is defeatists and wavering elements within the peace movement who, on the one hand, participate in the peace movement as a cover and, on the other hand, create various obstacles to hinder the progress of the peace movement. They hang up the signboard of participating in the peace movement while engaging in the dirty business of fishing in troubled waters... Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on December 9th... the government's responsibility has become even heavier, and the government's actions are more closely related to the people. The government's affairs are the people's affairs, and the people's affairs are also the government's affairs. The government's measures should take the people as their premise, so that these measures can exert their full force... To create a landscape of unity between the government and the people, we need to support the government with utmost sincerity and urge the government with utmost strictness. The responsibility of our journalistic circles is to communicate the opinions of the government and the people, to announce the government's intentions to the people, and to convey the public's opinion to the government. Our advocacy is based solely on the opinions of the general public. If it is thought that our advocacy of 'improving the political structure,' 'clarifying politics,' 'reforming personnel,' and various political, economic, and social reforms is opposing the government, such a view is truly unacceptable... Only those who truly dare to offer candid advice are those who truly support the government; and only those people who truly dare to urge the government are modern citizens who love the country. We reiterate even more painstakingly: 'Supporting the government on one hand, with utmost strictness.' to inform those who generally misinterpret 'support' and 'opposition.'" The publication of this editorial is now ten months past.</p>
<p>In our commentary on December 9th of last year, titled "Our Stance," we said: "Our stance on the current situation is to support the Nanjing National Government's peace policy and national policy. At the same time, we will cooperate with the allied nations to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, with the recent Greater East Asia Declaration as the highest ideal. Our stance in expressing our views is to take the people's will as our guide. The people are the foundation of the nation, and the state is originally a collective of the people. Inspiring the people's love for their country is not difficult and can even be said to be innate. Whether it is promoted and to what extent depends, frankly speaking, on whether those in power value public opinion and cherish the people. If they do, how can the people not love the government and love the country? Based on this principle, we absolutely value public opinion, base our arguments on public opinion, and express public opinion. Even if this leads us to advocate political reform to the government with some frankness, we do not mind, because we believe that this attitude is the most sincere expression to the government. Because in today's era, hypocritical praise is something we are unwilling to say and we believe is also something that enlightened authorities are unwilling to hear." The publication of this commentary will soon be three months past.</p>
<p>The above citations can specifically illustrate our stance over the past year. Is it "nitpicking at the government at all costs"? Is it "to separate or even antagonize the people from the government"? "Is it to overthrow the government?" I think that even women and children who have a little understanding of right and wrong would never distort it!</p>
<p>What era is this now? Everyone knows that we are at the decisive juncture of the Greater East Asia War and should have long ago collaborated with real strength to practically participate in the war. Let us reflect on what strength we have exerted since we participated in the war for more than a year. More in writing? More in speech? Or more in real strength? China's current situation is very difficult. Chongqing relies on Britain and the United States, stubbornly drags on the war, and divides the national strength. The Chinese Communist Party is using Chongqing's dragging on the war and poor politics to expand and spread its power, becoming the only major future threat in East Asia. Within the peace zone, has politics been on the right track? Is there no economic crisis? Can the belief in peace and the belief in participating in the war be firm? Has the problem of people's livelihood gradually improved or is it gradually becoming more serious? Please remove your colored glasses and open your eyes to look around. China's current situation has reached the brink of the greatest crisis. If we do not earnestly save it and instead blame it all on the unavoidable difficulties of wartime, then the crisis in the future will erupt overnight, which is unimaginable. For example, in the month or so before and after the Lunar New Year, the general price of goods has risen wildly by multiples, especially the black market price of rice has risen shockingly. What a serious anomaly this is for people's livelihood, yet we are at a loss. How can we completely blame it on the unavoidable difficulties of wartime?</p>
<p>The crisis has reached such a serious point, and of course it is not entirely the fault of the government. The people also have half the responsibility. The current state of society is full of an atmosphere of speculation, opportunism, and straddling the fence, only knowing the private interests of the individual and disregarding the public interests of the masses. The more profound the phenomenon of speculation and opportunism becomes, the more degenerate national morality becomes, and the weaker the concept of public interest becomes, and the more the spirit of sacrifice is buried. The government and the people should be jointly responsible for the formation of this phenomenon. The factor in the formation of this phenomenon is that powerful people between officials and the people initiate it from above, and cunning people in the private sector imitate it from below. The government does not use its power to stop it, and the general public dares to be angry but dare not speak out. Thus, it gets worse and worse. What is regrettable is that China has not yet established a public opinion mechanism. The people have no other way to urge the government to pay attention and hope for improvement except to express their opinions in public discourse.</p>
<p>Politicians of all ages, also known as the ruling authorities, must have a spirit of courage to reflect, a spirit of courage to innovate, and a heart that feels hunger when the people are hungry and feels drowned when the people are drowning, and seek to improve the people's livelihood. Only then can this government have a bright future. If the people in power in a government are all loyal to the country and seek to improve the people's livelihood, the people will naturally be happy to endure pain and sacrifice everything. Allied nation Japan is a good example. They have a parliament and a Greater Japan Political Association, listening to the people's opinions as much as possible. The government and the people truly share weal and woe. Officials do not take advantage of their positions to fish in troubled waters, and the people naturally have no grievances. For example, in Japan, even the royal family and the children of senior statesmen are drafted into military service and sent to the front lines, while the sons of important people in China are reveling, gambling, and dancing in Shanghai. In Japan, the appointment of officials must be based on their talents and abilities to ensure that they are competent. In China, there are hooligans as police officers and unscrupulous party and government personnel deducting military rations. Are these also unavoidable difficulties of wartime? Although there are also self-respecting and law-abiding officials in our government, I still feel that they are not widespread and their number is too small.</p>
<p>In short, we oppose Chongqing's dragging on the war, starting from winning the hearts of the people, hoping that one day we will jointly participate in the construction of Greater East Asia. We oppose the Communist Party's conspiracies of sabotage, starting with political innovation, to strengthen the power to eliminate the Communist Party. We oppose the Anglo-American invasion of East Asia, starting with cultivating strength, to cooperate with allied nations to strive for victory in the war. We oppose the wavering elements and defeatists in the peace camp, eliminating speculation and opportunism, and strengthening the belief in peace.</p>
<p>Our attitude is as stated above, supporting the government no less than others, and what we should support most is political innovation. We believe that striving for victory is first and foremost a distant prospect across the water, and political innovation is a bridge. We must first build the bridge before we can cross the water and receive the distant prospect. If politics is not reformed, and we extravagantly talk about striving for victory, it is no different from imagining a distant prospect in a dream. We will say definitively: Innovation first! Innovation first!</p>

I feel very honored to participate in this grand ceremony. Under the guidance of all the officials, you have achieved such excellent results, which is commendable.

<p>Corps Commander's Address</p>
<p>Corps Commander Wang's address was as follows: Today is the day we jointly hold the second anniversary commemorative ceremony of the establishment of the Corps and the graduation ceremony of the fifth class of officer teams and the seventh class of cadre teams. As the Corps Commander, I am unable to attend in person due to illness, so I have specially sent Deputy Corps Commander Bao to give the following instructions. The Central Officer Training Corps is the highest agency in the re-education of active-duty military officers. Its relationship with military construction is, of course, important, because it is necessary to have sound officers before one can establish a good army. The principle is obvious. Now, the Corps has graduated five classes of officer teams and seven classes of cadre teams. There is still one class of military research currently studying at the Corps. In total, no less than 3,000 people have graduated. Therefore, in the past two years, the work of reorganizing and building the army has also taken on a considerable scale and achieved results. Your stay at the Corps was very short, but you were able to diligently practice and make significant progress in the spirit, technology, and physical training taught at the Corps. I am deeply gratified. At the same time, it is also evident that the Allied advisors and the faculty of the Corps have provided effective leadership and education. I would like to express my deep gratitude to the advisors and faculty for their patient and hard work.</p>
<p>You are now at a critical juncture for the survival of the entire East Asian nation and the entire Chinese nation. Whether we seek life or death, whether we survive or perish, all depends on our efforts. I hope that you will all be at your respective posts, united in purpose and morality, courageous and diligent, and strive to complete our greatest mission. I am willing to encourage you all.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the representative of the graduates of the fifth class of officer teams and the seventh class of cadre teams of the Central Army Officer Training Corps gave a reply. The Director of Education of the Corps, Xiao Shuxuan, and all the officers and faculty members respectfully saluted Corps Commander Wang.</p>

<p>Chairman Takaishi delivered a speech:</p>
<p>"I am truly unworthy of the chairman's praise just now. The chairman said that compared to China's newspaper industry, Japan is in the position of an elder brother, but I think it is difficult to distinguish who is the elder brother and who is the younger brother. However, since there is such a close relationship between elder brother and younger brother, they cannot be separated from each other. Among the guests present, some have attended newspaper conferences or literary conferences in Japan, and they have already met. I heard that they all praised the beauty of the Japanese countryside after returning home, but in fact, we see the Chinese countryside as equally beautiful. China and Japan are geographically closest. They are close neighbors, and they need to be connected to each other, which can be said to be determined by fate, not by coercion. I have a kind of ambition, which is that we do not allow Europeans and Americans to intervene. We East Asians create an East Asia for East Asians ourselves. This ideal is like building a house. Everyone must work together to lay the foundation and build the house. The power of our news media is very important, and we should work together to move towards this ideal. Every Japanese citizen understands Japan's policy towards China, and at the same time, they all understand the situation in China, so they feel even more necessary to work together to create a Greater East Asia. In addition, I am even more concerned that some places are inconvenient because of the war, but there is no need to worry about it. With our joint strength, we are enough to win the victory and realize our ideals. In order to further strengthen the friendship between the news media of the two countries, I would like to borrow the host's glass of wine to wish each other well-being and everyone good health." After the speech, the banquet began. During the banquet, Chairman Takaishi, Minister Matsudaira, and Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, exchanged various opinions on the technical aspects of the newspaper industry, which was extremely cordial. Today at 12 noon, this newspaper will host a frugal meal at the Holiday Hua Club.</p>

<p>Tung Wah Easily Defeats Wah Tung</p>
<p>In the match between Tung Wah and Wah Tung, Tung Wah's Li Ning was injured and did not play, so Zhou Ji filled in temporarily. A Dai personally played, and Han Longhai still played as the right inside forward. In addition to Zhou Guangzhong's mistake, Wah Tung's team owner Jiang Yimen also came to help. After the two teams were ready, Tung Wah's five forwards advanced, and Dai Linjing was active on the front line. Han Longhai took the opportunity to shoot, and the record was opened. Wah Tung's counterattack was ineffective. Tung Wah came back again. Feng Shoupeng was anxious and sent the ball to Zheng Tongyu. Unexpectedly, Zheng was unprepared and rolled into the net, creating a funny scene. Tung Wah continued to work hard, and A Dai hit the goal post. Longhai headed the ball and broke the net again, making it three to zero. Seven minutes before the end of the first half, Li Yao swept across the field, and the ball hit the right goal post and bounced in. Tung Wah took the lead by four to zero. Eight minutes after the change of sides, Zhang Xianlun committed a foul in the penalty area and was awarded a penalty kick, which was taken by Sun Laojin, but it went over the crossbar.

But in less than a minute, Sun Tie-tui shot low from 15 yards into the net. Zhuang Youren sent the ball to Banglun, and Xiao Zhang came to save the goal, but the result was also an own goal.

<h3 id="e31">Authorities Authorize Various Associations to Transfer and Distribute Allocated Materials; Distribute Fairly According to Actual Circumstances <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The various industry associations in the city, in order to follow the intentions of the authorities and stabilize prices for a long time, have repeatedly requested the competent authorities to allocate sufficient materials or raw materials on a regular basis. The authorities have now approved, with reference to the actual situation, the allocation of the goods needed by the members of the industry for their business, and have authorized the industry association to be responsible for managing this matter and supervising the use of these allocated goods by the same industry. If there is any resale, it should be reported immediately so that it can be dealt with impartially.</p>
<p>It is heard that the method of transferring and distributing allocated materials is mostly based on the size of the business scope of each member, or the usual buying and selling situation, and is divided into four levels, A, B, C, and D, or other fair methods. However, those who have not joined the association as members are refused the right to enjoy the allocation. However, in order to prevent resale, it is stipulated that each member must submit a "Summary Table of Material Usage" for inspection every week or every ten days.</p>
<p>Pooling Funds for Direct Procurement</p>
<p>As for the various industry associations that have not obtained the right to allocate materials from the authorities, they all automatically raise capital and the association finds ways to directly procure from the production area. As soon as the procurement and transportation arrive in Shanghai,</p>
<p>This material will be transferred to the same industry based on the amount of funds recognized, but a limited price will be assessed in advance. At the same time, it is stipulated that all those who are wholesale must transfer the goods to the shops that operate such items, and those who are retail should sell them to legitimate users at the limited price in the store.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Weekly Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable. Since the authorities strictly cracked down on illegal transactions in the black market, the market situation has changed, and the money supply has been calmed immediately. Because the money lending industry has been particularly cautious in lending, it is still tight. The stock market prices have fluctuated slightly, and it is difficult to be optimistic about future market prices. Last Tuesday, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a price coordination meeting in Shanghai. After the price control measures were decided, the rising price trend was curbed. However, the black market price was still driven up by hoarding and speculation merchants. The key lies in the fact that rumors are rampant in the market, and people are restless. It is learned that the authorities have decided on a thorough method for stabilizing finance and suppressing prices. It is expected that the trend of illegal transactions will soon be eradicated.</p>
