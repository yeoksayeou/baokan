<h3>冷靜頭腦</h3>
<p>當英美軍隊在法國西部及南部登陸之後，德國軍隊陸續往本國固守，英美的樂觀論者認爲柏林的陷落不過短時期的事，歐洲戰爭立卽可以結束了。伺人顏色的重慶更大事宣傳廣播，說歐洲戰事解決之後，太平洋的戰事亦不久可以解決了。慣於造謠的上海投機份子，推波逐瀾，更造出許許多多欺騙大家，損害國家的流言，以遂他們個人高度發財，個人高度享受的私計。　　不料邱吉爾從奎貝克會議返英以後，九月二十八日向衆議院報告會議結果，說明在軍事上面，戰事無法立刻結束，並且警告國人，不可存空想，而必須繼續努力。所有樂觀的論調，竟爲之一掃而空，歐洲局勢旣然如此，東亞大局更是不必談起了。我們不知道重慶的樂觀論者，上海的造謠生事之輩，對此將何以自解。　　邱吉爾的報告是德國實力的最明顯的表現，是德國實力的最有力的證明，原來德國放棄法國西部和南部以後，他僅僅失去了和地中海及英吉利海峽的接觸，因此他可以集中他的陸軍於本土，集中他的海軍於北海，軍隊不再分散之後，力量的發揮自然便利，而所發揮的力量更爲偉大。這固然不能說是德國預定的策略，可是這卻是軍事上的常識。英美人士明瞭這一點的，自然再也不能發出樂觀的論調了。　　我們時常向國人提醒這一點，希望國人用冷靜的頭腦，依常識來判斷，我們的目的只在希望大家在這個動盪的世界，不致於被浪流所沖去，不致於受無謂的犧牲。只有握定主張，一步一步，腳踏實地的工作，方才能得獨立的自存。重慶的人云亦云，到後來不過是[扳磚自壓]，上海的造謠生事，先是害了大衆，到後來還是連自身也不保的。　　在大時代裹面做一個國民，做一個有知識的國民，做一個對已對人對國家都有利的國民，是任何一個國民做人的目標。怎樣做到這個目的？唯一的先決問題就在頭腦的冷靜與否。現世界充滿取巧，投機，欺騙的空氣，這是戰時體制還沒有走上軌道以前的過渡現象，等到一上軌道之後，這些現象都自然消滅無蹤。最可憐的便是被欺騙，被利用的一般人，到了眞相畢露，證明謠言並非實事的時候，糊裹糊塗的犧牲。要知道重慶和上海的投機份子，造謠取巧的目的只在爲少數人謀權利，謀享受，如若有人附和，他們的私人計劃也就成功，如若沒有人附和，他們的私人計劃也就失敗，而對於附和的人們，根本只有犧牲，其他一無所得。盲從者一定走入犧牲的路，這也是自然的。德國的謎現在已經由反軸心的邱吉爾來證明，自足予一般造謠的人一個極大的打擊，更足予一般盲目的人一個清晰的認識。其他的謎，其他的投機取巧的事可是在目前還不能夠立刻消滅，因此冷靜的頭腦更顯出他的重要性，更爲一般所重要。</p>
<h3>培里琉繼續日守軍晝夜創敵菲日陸空軍準備發揮戰力</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　帛琉羣島日守軍，敢然抵抗敵之物量攻勢，連日繼續奮戰，培里琉島方面，於九月三十日會有一部敵軍來攻中央高地之水府山，然經日守軍予以痛擊後，即將之擊退。訪島日軍於全綫不分晝夜，繼續突擊。肉搏攻擊班亦不時出動，予敵以重創，其中以二十九日夜攻擊最爲激烈，多數突擊班分頭殺入敵陣，先頭兩組殺傷敵人達七十餘人，其後突擊隊員仍安然歸還，是夜突擊作戰實行後，敵將士無不喪胆，日軍並鹵獲各種兵器及彈藥糧秣等甚夥，亞特布斯之安格維爾島，亦仍繼續激戰中。　　東京二日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，培里琉島日軍，日夜勇戰，已予敵以重創，據該部隊之戰況報告，不僅連日有勇戰之戰果，其不擊滅敵軍不止之戰鬥意識，亦極旺盛，且一部精銳增援部到達後，戰意更加昂揚。日增援部隊增援成功後，與守備部隊結合，立即赴第一綫，連續向敵陣肉搏，二十八日夜更分數班潛入敵陣，斃敵將兵多名，鹵獲迫擊砲二鬥，機關砲二門後，悠悠歸返陣地，此項新銳部隊，更於二十九日夜衝入敵陣，殺傷敵軍二百九十餘，且此奇襲部隊滿載敵軍彈藥糧秣數車返歸，敵培里琉島之日軍，今確保該島中央高地一帶陣地。　　東京二日中央社電　日軍事家就美軍侵攻菲律賓事，表明見解如次：太平洋之美軍侵攻菲律賓將愈益露骨，除於培里琉·安格維爾·摩羅泰各島登陸外，更以菲律賓地方日空軍基地爲止標，不顧損失，反復轟炸。然菲律賓絕非孤立於太平洋上之小島，陸上之大批日軍，刻正執戈待敵，日空軍於各基地，亦候時機到來，是以敵軍之菲律賓侵攻企圖，實與歐洲侵攻作戰同爲一大冒險，實爲日軍殲敵之絕好機會。敵軍在歐洲之成功，乃爲二年來戰略所賜，尤以最後之半年間，英美兩軍之戰略轟炸，不分晝夜，猛炸德國工業地帶，及產油地之設施，以及合成油工廠等。但日本之軍需工業殆未遭受敵軍之直接攻擊，空軍部隊之消耗率亦極低，當決戰之際，日本將發揮如何戰力，實爲世界之謎。現敵軍雖行轟炸，但其規模很小，旣非戰略之轟炸，又非戰術轟炸，如攻擊海上艦船等，僅爲期待一時之效果而已。</p>
<h3>日軍各地週間戰況</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電東亞各地週間戰況如次　　○中國方面（陸地作戰）華中華南方面，日軍作戰順利進展中，華中方面日軍，二十七日攻略寶慶，華南方面日軍二十八日佔領丹筆飛機塲，二十九日佔領丹竹市街，賡續進擊中。今桂林地區飛機塲羣已失去其機能，予駐渝美空軍威脅甚大。又佔領溫州附近日軍部隊，確保同地附近各要點，佔領麗水日軍部隊，達成作戰目的，恢復現態勢力。（航空作戰）日航空部隊協力華中，華南地上作戰，共同擔任要地防空，進攻西安，柳州，芷江，梁山，成都等地，拘束敵美空軍之蠢動，自二十一起至八日間之戰果如下：擊落擊毀及起火達百二十五架，敵美空軍喪失桂林附近重要之機能，近來殆未見有敵機來襲華中方面之戰塲及衡陽附近。　　○滿洲方面　二十六日敵機七八十架來襲鞍山，大連，本溪湖地區，敵機最初來襲南滿地區時，在七月二十九日，而八月四日，二十七日，九月八日，九日，二十六日，二十七日亦有一二架敵機偵察的來襲，共約七次達八九十架。　　○緬甸方面　怒江方面日軍部隊，上月十一日完全解圍龍陵後，二十日左右俄然對芒市東南方面採取攻勢，二十二日對自六月初旬起企圖奪回該市而反攻之優勢敵軍寡勢力戰，與奮鬥中之平憂守備部隊連絡成功，遂告解圍，是時予敵之損害，在三千以上。　　○太平洋方面　於培果琉島登陸之敵軍約二師團，其一部於二十五日在嘉爾得羅爾克登陸，又於二十六日在格亞特布斯島登陸，日軍則固守東山，觀測山，大山，水府山等中央高地一帶之要點，日夜與敵軍血戰，予以重創。敵因死傷甚衆，連日以病院船運送傷亡將士，極其忙碌，同時敵軍更於該島方面增援，以期大舉進攻，是役敵軍所出動之空母總數達數十艘以上，其中並含有制式空母十餘艘。在安格維爾島登陸之敵兵力約有半師，日軍則佔據該島西北高地之要點，與之奮戰。於摩羅泰島登陸之敵軍兵力約一師團餘，彼等並構築廣二十公里縱約七公里之橋頭堡，日軍則於各處密林地帶與敵等肉搏，予以重創。此外，日軍並連日攻擊摩羅泰島之敵軍登陸地點，獲得相當戰果。日空軍自敵軍於登陸以來，至二十五日止，共重創其巡洋艦及大型輸送船各一艘，擊沉其潛水艇一艘，擊沉或擊毀其登陸用舟艇約三四十艘，此外，並使其中型輸送船一艘起火燃燒，而敵登陸地點亦蒙重大損失。菲律賓方面，聞來襲之敵艦載機最多，前一日達四百架，嗣後即漸次減少，最近已無大規模之轟炸。反之，日空軍則於二日晨在菲律賓東方海面團攻敵空母，將其驅散，又日空軍於西加羅林羣島一帶海面亦異常活躍，同時敵空軍對於加羅林，菲律賓，摩羅泰等各島日軍基地之轟炸，亦相當熾烈。　　○印度洋方面，自上週以來，無顯著變化。</p>
<h3>爪哇實行生產責任制</h3>
<p>爪加爾達二日中央社電　爪哇軍政監部爲增進爪哇戰力，特規定[生產責任制]，最近已通告關係各方面。按該制度適用於飛機，兵器，船舶及其他現地堅急必要物資之生產加工及修理之工塲，通力運營，期急速達成目的。</p>
<h3>晉南日軍戰果</h3>
<p>太原二日中央社電晉南晶軍九月中下旬討伐戰果，收容渝軍棄屍一千二百五十，鹵獲迫擊砲一門，輕機關槍五十五挺，步槍三百五十八架，自動步槍十四架，擲彈筒八柱。</p>
<h3>泰防空局發表北部遭空襲越南民衆關懷桂戰局</h3>
<p>盤谷二日中央社電泰國防空局三十就最近敵機來襲泰國北部狀況·發表如次：二十三·四·六日三日每日下午二時許，有敵機數架來襲鳥特拉底特地方，以機槍掃射及轟炸，然僅有少數死傷，損失頗輕。又二十四日上午四時許，故機數架來襲乾來地方，毀壞房屋若干，並有若干死傷。　　西貢二日中央社電越南與廣西壤地相接，故其國民對桂省戰局備極關懷，日駐越大使芳澤氏，日前訪總督德古氏時，亦會就該方面之戰況詳予叩詢。聞越南民衆最表關心者，厥爲桂林美空軍對越南弱部之濫炸，蓋最近美空軍連日以小型機從事偵察，並時以飛機兩三架伺機來襲，除破壞軍事設施外，並掃射無辜之民船，當地居民深爲憤激，但由於日軍此次攻入廣西，美機此種殘虐行爲，已不得不歛跡，故越南民衆無不盼日軍早日席捲廣西。</p>
<h3>日鑛物增產獲良好成績</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日軍需省前於八九月間，會實施重要鑛物必勝增產運動，按其物質在求各種鑛物之急速戰時化，此次施策，自實施以來，業經收獲極好成績，茲爲確保今後繼續增產，並另行新施策，以期強力推進，担任此項重要責任之加賀山非鐵金屬局長，茲特發表談話如次：增產期間開始之八月成績稍遜，但其後情形逐漸好轉後，成績極爲圓滿。其間因風雨炎，一部鑛區稍受災害，但整個成績極爲良好，殊值快慰，八九月最後之統計，雖尚未明，然綜合最近情形，銅約在二成以上，鉛三成以上，亞鉛一成，其他鐵鑛，水銀，　，錳，石綿等，亦有顯示極好成績，尤以石綿鉾之增產，超越預定目標，達二倍以上，較去年增產期之收獲，尤顯示極好成績。</p>
<h3>日成立戰時宗教報國會</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日本三十萬宗教職業者，爲挺身報國，特組織大日本戰時宗教報國會，三十日下午三時，假大東亞會館集聚各宗教代表約二百人及文部省職員，在二宮文相之主持下，舉行盛大會議，且發表宣言，全日本之宗教職業者，不分神道佛教基督教之別，均以宗教報國爲目的，共同團結，協力完遂戰爭。</p>
<h3>孟買會談決裂英最受影響</h3>
<p>仰光二日中央社電甘地·基那會談，於上月六日決裂，此次會談中，基那堅決主張[回印分離]，甘地主張[回印分離與否，須待人民投票決定]，而英國會主張[回印兩教須先解決對立問題，然後始得與英國政府論議印度獨立問題]，以上三項主張，似已同軌，然孟買會談如其謂爲甘地·基那之印回問題會議，不如謂爲英國與甘地妥協會談，更有一般人認爲，甘地對英國獻媚之會談。至於決裂之原因，雖不甚詳，更據基那所述，可知甘地翁對於回印分離案，始終主張須待人民投票，會談決裂之主因，即在於此。甘地對於回教徒之妥協案，固甚合理，故回教徒外表對此皆喜悅，然其內心則含有不締決裂之強硬案件，甘地向英國提出之樹立印度國民政府之私案，雖與克里浦斯案相似，然其中仍有刺激英國之處，所以甘地與英國眞實妥協，亦屬疑問。甘地絕不能再受英國之驅使，然甘地之目的究何在，靜觀印度之反響，當即了然。此次會談之決裂，不論是否爲甘地政治之失敗，或基那之最大失策，受其最大之影響者，實乃英國也。惟印度中央政界之一部，對於與英國妥協一項，最近頗有焦燥心情，以甘地之智慧，確係絕不能放棄由印度驅逐英國之宿志，而忍辱妥協。然而甘地將來究取何種手段，據斯巴斯之批評，[印度國民運動指導者，對於自己之任務，絕不停止一刻]之言辭觀之，出獄後之甘地，當然不能靜觀是非，然而甘地於印度國內究有何種貢獻，在孟買會談及其他瘊裂過程中，益見甘地之態度矣。</p>
<h3>駐蚌綏署舉行成立典禮</h3>
<p>蚌埠二日中央社電蚌綏靖公署及安徽保安司令部，於昨（一）日上午十時，假省府大禮堂隆重舉行成立典禮。計劃有綏靖主任兼保安司令羅君強，省府各廳處局長，盟邦中山連絡部長，曁各機關團體代表四百餘人。繼由皖省府政務廳長胡澤吾，中山連絡部長，國府委員倪道烺等，相繼致詞。十一時禮成，駐蚌綏靖公署人事列後：綏靖公署參謀長郭爾珍，參謀處長公伯良，副官處長曹今港，軍械處長許挺生，軍需處長李百川，軍法處長蔡日新，秘書主任戎漢一，秘書劉明吉等。</p>

<h3>外籍醫藥人員請領證書辦法限於醫藥互惠國家</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電外籍醫師在我國各地行醫者甚多，但在華之外籍醫師，及其醫藥從業人員，申請證書，是否依法頒發，其處理情形又何如，頗爲各方所注意。記者故特訪謁衛生署長陸潤之氏，叩詢一切，當承告稱：[在華之外籍醫藥從業人員申請頒發本署證書者，按國民政府本年二月一日所公布之醫師法，僅限於訂有醫藥互惠協定之國家人民。友邦德國，頃已正式由德國大使館咨達外交部，轉咨本署，承認吾國醫藥從業人員，有在德國執行業務之權利。該國對於我國醫藥從業人員旣有互惠精神，故本署對於在華之德國醫藥從業人員請領證書者，亦特予照辦。惟所有申請書類，須經德使館送由外交部咨行本署核辦，此種辦法，已由本署將申請書類，送由外交部轉送德使館查照辦理]</p>

<h3>日軍主力部隊已迫近興安美空軍部承認丹竹陷落</h3>
<p>廣州二日中央社電　據重慶電，駐渝美空軍司令部，一日發表公報，確認中國南部之美空軍前綫基地丹竹已陷落，日軍手中，但渝軍委會發表則未會提及，僅謂日軍沿湘桂鐵路南下，其主力部隊目下進抵興安東北之界盲，及東南之犁實坊九塊田附近。更承認防衛桂林之最後據點興安，危機已愈迫切。</p>
<h3>梧州已成一片麗礫</h3>
<p>梧州二日中央社電　　州因駐渝美空軍實行焦土戰術，刻已成爲一片麗礫。據當地盧舍蕩然之民衆讀稱，美空軍見日軍沿西江兩岸進攻，梧州頗危，乃先事逃逸。渝地方官則嚴令市民於九月十吾日以前，務行疏散，不服從者輒遭毆打。民衆無奈只得遵令避往山野。乃美空軍竟於日軍入城前之二十一二十二兩日，先後以飛機五架，到處投下高性能炸彈，並散放多數燒夷彈，甚至以機關砲亂作掃射。於是市內到處起火，加以風乾物燥，以至火勢延燒，不可抑止，燒遍全市，延燒四天三夜，街市全行毀滅。日軍入城後，市民陸續歸返，見日軍於焦土中鳩工從事救濟災民工作，不禁恍然覺悟，孰爲中國民衆這仇敵云。　　華南前綫二日中央社電　梧州城內因焦土戰術，已完全化爲廢墟。市內無論軍事施設或民房，當渝軍敗退之際，會遭渝美機數次轟炸，堅固房屋殆幾無有。沿西江之碼頭地區，亦化爲瓦礫。然日軍佔領梧州後，即積極開始建設工事，由宣傳隊憲兵隊對歸來住民交付良民證，及辦理其他恢復治安工作，復興市街等，活躍異常。</p>

<p>華南基地二日中央社電　日軍此次於中國西南部展開之大作戰，爲過去中國戰綫未會有之大變化，中國西南部乃重慶抗戰財政之原動力，尤其渝美空軍於該地區設立強力基地，藉以蠢動。然此次日軍之進攻，不僅重慶抗戰地盤，即渝美空軍之前進據點，亦將潰滅。此次作戰尤堪注目之點，爲○渝軍之抗日戰意顯著低減，○民衆對日軍之協力積極化，○對美軍之反感日深。按日軍開始行動以來，幾乎未受重大抵抗。上月二十日日軍攻略之德慶，其野戰倉庫及機材倉庫，堆滿軍需物資，亦未予燒毀或撤走即遁去，城內亦幾乎未予破壞，由此可見渝軍戰意低下之一般。又渝軍誇稱最強之第卅五集團軍各種兵力，爲避免消耗，僅以小部隊配置於抵抗綫，主力部隊均退卻。最屬奇異者，乃新佔領地區民衆對日軍澈底之協力，如於新興江渡河作戰之際，該地住民集合民船數十隻，協力日軍，此皆民衆協力之事實。由此可見民衆已理解日軍之眞意，此種潮流，已瀰漫於重慶治下各地。</p>
<h3>中樞紀念週</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電中國國民黨中央黨部，於今（二日）日晨十時，在該黨部大禮堂舉行第二一二次總理紀念週。到中央執監委員各部會工作同志，政府機關國民黨黨員等六百餘人，由褚秘書長民誼主席。行禮如儀後，並報告視察北方黨務，及參觀文化團體情形，報告畢禮成散會。　　南京二日中央社電國府二日週會，徐文官長主席，報告舉行週會意義。</p>

<p>柏林二日中央社電德國社訊：在阿爾巴尼亞各據點登陸之英軍，尤其在希馬拉與伐洛那區，爲德軍所擊退。英第五空輸師團·第二空輸旅團·與蘇格蘭山地步兵團，各以數分隊至一聯隊之兵力登陸，其中有不少被俘。敵登陸之分隊企圖彼此保持接觸，但結果於被阻。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹戰事進入初期階段</h3>
<p>德集結大軍增強防禦　　柏林二日中央社電德軍當局一日宣稱：目下巴爾幹方面德軍，再度集結大規模兵力，但德軍如何結成新戰綫，刻非言明之時期。　　柏林二日中央社電海通社訊：巴爾幹區多瑙河灣之鐵門兩面，今已形成東綫之新戰塲，已見昨日德軍戰報首次提及該處之戰況。德軍在該處作戰之重要戰略意義，乃在遏阻蘇軍之突入塞爾維亞，蘇軍進攻之目的，則在切斷愛琴海區之德軍，該處戰事現尚在初期階段。阿拉特區（Arad）與托達（Turda）一帶現有激戰。</p>
<h3>羅洪邊境戰事熾烈</h3>
<p>蘇軍堅強部隊自羅境出擊，向東洪牙利之齊傑特城（Szeged）進攻，德洪聯軍在最近二十四小時內，不獨能遏阻其銳勢，且在苦戰中已克復阿拉特與齊傑特間之基斯索姆巴（Kis　Zombor）並自西面進入馬科（Mrko），yvarad）迤北巳進入洪牙利國境，德軍在其進抵邊境後，突破蘇羅軍陣綫。蘇軍在齊克勒（Szekler）企圖渡越密爾希河，船隻三十七艘遭德軍砲火猛轟，蘇軍溺斃甚衆，蘇軍連續四次渡河，始獲構成一小橋頭堡。</p>
<h3>蘇軍戰略三項目標</h3>
<p>布達佩斯二日中央社電　據前綫情報：東南歐洲戰綫之蘇軍，有轉作全面大攻勢之傾向，同時德洪聯軍之強化防衛陣綫工作，亦着着進展。蘇軍之目標大致如下：○侵入斯洛伐克，○佔據洪牙利平原，○由塞爾維亞馬其頓方面攻抵亞得里亞海岸，使南部之德軍孤立，○制壓希腦土耳其兩國。目下作戰之主要地點有三：○確保斯洛伐克東北國境多克拉公路，○由洪羅國境之奧拉第亞·馬科間侵入拉茲薩平原，○塞爾維亞之鐵門作戰。但喀爾巴阡最重要之多克拉通路，仍在德軍掌握中。喀爾巴阡山系之通路，約經一月後行將降雪，不能作戰，蘇軍至感焦慮。拉茲薩及奧拉第亞·馬科間高原之進攻，將制洪牙利之死命。他方蘇軍由布加勒斯特方面，爲防禦後方連絡綫之側，外錫爾凡尼亞作戰乃爲牽制性質，蘇軍之進攻被德軍擊退，馬科至鐵門之巴納特方面德軍，防守至爲堅強，德蘇兩軍展開激戰。德軍在塞爾維亞馬其頓方面，與由希腦北上之保軍蒂托軍等展開混亂之激戰，該地於一月後天氣嚴寒，作戰將感困難。以上三方面作戰，已足顯示東南歐洲戰綫急激化之形勢。</p>
<h3>北路德軍放棄蒙島</h3>
<p>東綫北路蘇軍在特維那與里加灣間進攻，均遭擊退，蒙島（ls.　Moon）經苦戰之後，終以軍力衆寡懸殊而告失守。除華沙區剿除波蘭叛軍之戰事外，東綫中路並無重大戰事。</p>
<h3>蘇聯關心太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>莫斯科二日中央社電　蘇聯眞理報三十日揭載一文，論述太平洋戰局，言日軍事態之重大，並說明日本前綫與後方打成一片之決戰準備。結論謂大平洋戰局之轉換已迫目前。該報之論說與[戰爭及勞動報]九月十五日所揭載之論說及[紅色艦隊]九月廿三日所揭載之太平洋戰局相同，可證明蘇聯對最近太平洋戰局關心至切，莫斯科外交界已注目於此點矣。</p>
<h3>荷境尼美根區德軍發動反攻</h3>
<p>美軍在梅茲集中兵力　　里斯本二日中央社電　據路透社前綫消息：德軍頃已調遣載車及步兵部隊發動反攻，並渡過距尼美根北方約七公里之橋頭堡，着着南下。至英軍目下亦在空軍掩護之下，在勒克河南與德軍激戰中　　柏林二日中央社電德國社訊，軍息，美軍刻正向法東北部梅茲集中重軍器及兵力，準備向該堡壘發動大規模之攻勢，該地前哨陣地中之德軍已堵塞一缺口，並俘敵頗衆。越過買士運河之大橋三座已被德軍炸毀。　　柏林二日中央社電海通社訊：加拿大第一軍在荷蘭南部及比利時邊境，作大規模之軍事行動，企圖擴大其在荷蘭突破處南部根據地，安特衛普透恩霍物（Turnbout）運河一帶竟日激戰，加軍卒獲在沃斯特瑪爾季襁擴大其立足點。</p>
<h3>加萊要塞已告失守</h3>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　歐洲反軸心軍司令部三十日晚發表：加萊要塞爲利便一般市民避難，過去二十四小時內根據協定爲停戰狀態，至三十日正午復開始戰爭。　　里斯本二日中央社電　據反軸心軍方面消息：反軸心軍已佔領英法海峽上要衝加萊。</p>
<h3>蘇聯與波代表談判進行中</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　德國社訊：據莫斯科消息，星期五六兩日，蘇聯政府與波蘭代表團（包括波蘭解放會代表與波蘭高級司令部代表）進行特別久長之談判，蘇聯方面由斯達林與外委長莫洛托夫出席參加談話。</p>
<h3>呑敵的氣魄</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>我們目前用不着豪語壯言，所需要者只是吞敵的氣魄。這種氣魄，必須是一億國民所共同的氣魄。其中最重要者，是先知先覺的指導者之氣魄。尤其重要者，是立於國政要津者及肩負軍務重任者的氣魄。　　現在有一句流行的話，即國民總武裝。然而我們用什麼來武裝呢？主要的武裝就是吞敵的氣魄。即對於任何問題，各自都有充分自信的氣魄。這種氣魄固然說是由下而燃燒起來的，但我們相信這種氣魄必須經過上面的指導，而才由下面燃燒起來。假如一國當權的將相，等到下面的氣魄燃燒起來才行動，這就是大錯而特錯的事。無論在任何民主的社會中，羣衆必須由指導者來指導。何史在破釜沉舟，決一死戰的時候，決定國民存亡者，將更是指導者的氣魄。古之名將都說勝敗繫於一個人的情緒。　　社會上一般人說，以物量對抗物量，以鐵擋鐵，以飛機擋飛機。專門家這樣說是應該的。例如飛機製造業者，無論在性能方面，也無論在數量方面，都要勝過敵人。都在不應輸給敵人的決心下從事自己的本位工作。然而這決不是對日本全體所作的原即。假如國民都認爲勝負決定於物量的多寡，則大東亞戰爭一定不會發生。這一戰爭尚未發動以前，誰都知道盎格魯撒克遜的物量是遠超過日本無數倍的。然而不管這一有目共睹有耳共聞的事實，而我們日本竟自頒佈了聖戰的詔書，這畢竟是日本另有所恃，而並非唯物量是恃。　　我們決不忽視物量，也不輕視物量。然則戰爭畢靠物量是行不通的，這一理由，請看最近美國第四次轟炸九州北部時，遠藤中尉會單人獨機擊墜五架敵方飛機，也足可證明勝負並不取決於物量。　　目前日本全國都在大聲急呼，飛機不足。快製造飛機這樣口號，響徹天涯海角。我認爲這個藥方不但十分有靈騐，而且過於靈騐。按政府當局說，日本的飛機生產決不下於世界大強國的第二位。且飛機的性能很可以說雄視一切而無愧，退一步說，總不至於不及他國。唯今日尚有遺憾者，即未能十分發揮其效能，我相信在最近的將來，定會解消這一隱憂。　　於是我們在今天還需要再加以強調者，就是提倡吞敵的氣魄。尤其是應當提倡國政長官以及陸海軍首腦等人物的吞敵氣魄。一人之心就是千萬人之心。假如當局以必勝信念而執行任務，則國民定會瘋狂地燃燒起必勝信念來。　　一九○四—五年日俄戰爭時，聯合艦隊司令長官的人選問題，我和別人都認準應當是日高海軍上將。然而山本海相卻提拔不久即將退爲預備役的舞鶴鎭守府長官東鄉上將，而向天皇保奏。日高和山本是莫逆的知已。日高對於這樣過於意外的事情作夢也未會想到，到後來終於成爲事實時，就跑到山本家去直接開始談判。但山本很乾脆地向日高說：[你生氣是有一面之理的。但你的智慧是過份了，謀策是太多了。唯其如此，才保奏一智之勇的東鄉]。東鄉是始終如一而有吞敵氣魄的。他會禀告天皇殲敵的決心，以安宸襟，這決非過言。必勝信念，也就是吞敵氣魄，使他如此上奏的。正成在笠置拜謁後醒醐天皇時奏言：[正成一息尚存，決不勞天皇分神]，這與東鄉的思想，實同出一轍。　　我們決不是認爲物量無用。只是單純物量，決不能決定勝負。試觀一個最普通的例子，一般人常喜歡講宮本武藏和佐佐木岩柳的比武。岩柳向人眩耀着備前無人不曉的四尺上下的大刀，而武藏則由馬關來擂台時，拿來一個槳楫削成木刀，就拿着這把木刀迎上前去。然而正式比武時，槳楫應急作出來的木刀，竟能砍死對方。這樣說，並不是武器無用論。如有可能，自然儘量用有效的武器。然而武器是由人來使用的，而人並非是由武器來使用的。　　試觀識田信長的桶狹間。今川的大兵號稱五萬。信長的兵，充其量也不到三千。信長的宿將老臣等，全勸信長不要發動無謀的戰爭。然而信長卻用迅雷不及掩耳的辦法，襲擊義無的大本營，而殺死義元。中國也有許多這樣事情，例如赤壁之戰，曹操軍隊會號稱百萬。東吳的君臣都色變氣沮，準備投降。然而周瑜魯肅等卻主張一戰，終於火燒魏營八百里。　　再舉一個陳腐的希腦和波斯戰爭的實例。雖說陳腐，但事實總歸是事實。克塞吉斯一世搜羅西亞大半的兵力來侵犯希腦。但被渺乎其小的希腦兵，無論在陸地上，也無論在海面上，都打得落花流水，屁滾尿流。　　我們再看一下元寇入侵日本的事。村田清風詠歌而贊曰：　　借問敷島大和心　　　首斬元使一時宗　　這是一首如何痛快淋漓的歌呵！時宗之所以爲時宗，就完全在於這一點。他並非自始就獨斷獨行想謀殺蒙古使節。是奏請朝廷，而獲得委託後才斬的。第一次大臣會議時，決定不寫回信。但後來又決定回信，草稿完成後呈交鎌倉，而又徵求時宗的意見，時宗始終如一，堅持最初大臣會議的意見，不寫回信，於是回信草稿便保管於鎌倉，未交予蒙古使節。時宗遵奉會議旣經決定的方針，而有斷然完成的決心。實際上時宗之所以爲時宗，就在於他有吞敵的氣魄。這一氣魄由前方的將士滲入一般人民，於是全國上下無不燃燒起吞敵的氣魄。　　我們沒有充分篇幅來詳變元寇侵略我國的歷史。然而遠超過今日我們所想像，敵人是聲勢浩大，而我方則捉襟露肘，一無所有。在物量問題上，我們日本實非對手。這一點在當時的記載[入幡愚童訓]上，說得非常詳盡。當時日本並無軍隊組織。源平以來，全部是主張單人獨馬交鋒。但敵方卻有隊伍的編織。勇者一人不能進，怯者一人不能退，是這樣完全按號令進退的，且想由左右兩翼包抄毫無紀律的日本兵士。再有敵方的武器，遠比日本優秀。而八幡愚童訓一書中有如下的紀載：　　[蒙古之矢雖短，但矢根塗有毒物，一觸即中毒身死，茅長刺物而不弛，一齊並列，如有近前者，則中部後退，兩端攏來，構成包圍形式而殺之。（中略）胃輕善騎，力強而不怕死，強盛勇猛，自在無窮，指揮如意，大將立於高處，退則擊逃鼓，懸則扣責鼓，於是進退不亂。逃時則燃砲而使昏天黑地，聲高則心迷，肝失，目眩，耳塞，茫然不知東西。日本軍則不顧名利，宛如個人之勝負。這次會戰一經軍隊相遇，手足動處，爭光恐後，捕殺前進，如是則日本人排山倒海，單個衝向前去]。　　於是可以看出來，日本兵不僅沒有武器，而且也無戰法。同時日本比對方更少合作。這一點在時宗所寫的文件當中，是非常明白的。即於建治元年七月，變後給守護職大友賴泰所寫的鎌倉將軍之訓示，也可以知道。　　[異族強盜去年來侵時，常聞臨戰塲進而不鬥者有之，自稱守境而不前衝者有之，以致課以大逆不道之罪。今後凡不守忠節者，即科以極刑。希國民瞭解斯旨，身體力行]。　　在此也可以看出來，九州的諸侯中，最初會有臨戰塲，進而不鬥者，甚至自稱守領地而不派兵赴戰塲者。換言之，當時的軍隊並談不到忠勇不二。他們保守自己的領地而不動，縱勉強赴戰塲亦不與敵交鋒，其態度實可謂卑怯而自和。</p>

<h3>市區對銷綫內米榖移動自由限制辦法適用於封鎖綫進出</h3>
<p>米糧統制會於上月二十七日通告，凡搬運米榖在八公斤以上者禁止移動一節，各界以該通告內未指明地區頗屬費解，頃中央社記者向有關方面探悉，上述限制搬運數量，祗適用本市郊區封鎖綫之進出而言，凡市民封鎖綫以內搬運米榖者，並不受通告內數量之限制。</p>
<h3>物價波動劇烈當局進行澈查囤積投機刺激漲風</h3>
<p>本市物價近趨反常，尤其有關民生之米食油等市價，波動甚烈，中央社記者頃向各關係方面探悉，此種趨勢，大部份出於人爲，若無資本家事先爭購，及投機商囤積，絕不致有劇烈漲風。現據米統會及油糧統制會之報告，</p>
<h3>本年各地秋收豐稔</h3>
<p>華中沿長江流域一帶，爲產米區域，除江北地區爲雜糧豐產及浙江省產米稍次外，　皖兩省爲產米量豐之區，每年產量不獨能自治自足，且能裝運接濟鄰省，本年夏秋以來，風雨調順，皖省蕪湖·桐縣·廬江·蚌埠·明光·裕溪口，蘇省之江寗縣·陵懷關,及沿滬寗綫之無錫·常州·金壇·常熟·蘇州·崑山·松江·上海四郊·青浦·清東·浦南等區，稻穗生長極好，現各地區新米已次第登塲，較去年收成，超達三成至四成以上，米統會已分在蘇州·鎭江·南京·蕪湖等各主要產區，普設辦事處，調整價格，加強收購米糧，充實今後戶口米配給需要。在此新毅之登塲時期，當局又準備充實戶口米配給，米價理應回跌，不料近來反見高漲，查係各地區農商把持米價，不肯脫售，及上海商民購藏所致。查本市商民存米，據統計可敷半年之需要，惟此種存米，悉在擁資人手中，故上海存米雖多，而貧困市民因無積儲餘糧，日買高價之米，負重極苦，希當局對此種問題勿予輕視。</p>
<h3>協助澈查食油囤積</h3>
<p>食油市價較之兩週以前高漲半倍以上，此種原因，固近月來源稀少，但存貨甚爲充足，可供本市三月之需要，惟一般食用油商，虛報登記存量，扳不脫售，同業互相提高售價，油糧統制會現一面積極設法向當局請求疏通大連豆油來源，一面集資收購雜糧，準備指定委託商製油生產，對於食用油及雜糧計劃統一運輸及生產管理，故今後食油供需無虞匱乏。關於食用油取締囤積者，現經濟保安處亦將協助澈查，希一般市民勿自相驚擾，任意購藏，極力抑平漲風。</p>
<h3>市校收解學費係規定辦法</h3>

<h3>贊助助學運動</h3>
<p>這幾年來，上海的社會事業，辦得最有聲色的首推助學事業，[助學]已經形成了很普遍的蓬蓬勃勃，熱烈推進，一方面固然是申報，新聞報諸位的努力倡導，一方面還是社會各界人士的熱心贊助。出錢出力，分工合作，也可以說是民間運動的模範。　　社會人士的贊助情況，我們可以從申新兩報，每日所刋載的助學金損款報告中，窺見各階層都有熱心人士。其次如節約俗禮移作助學的，以物質或技能義獻助學的，捐　的方式與數量雖各有殊，而助學的勢忱卻是一致的。從助學運動普遍和熱烈推進一點觀察，更感到是國家前途光明的反映。　　最近，本市聯華銀行張邦鐸，劉哲民兩先生，也熱心贊助助學運動，聯合申報新聞報主辦中西音樂大會，以門劵所得悉數撥充申新兩報助貸學金。音樂會分國樂與西樂兩組，國樂組由國樂研究會於十月二三兩日演奏（今日爲國樂演奏最後一天，門劵闌心戲院可購）西樂組由國立音樂院於十月五六兩日演奏。均假座蘭心大戲院演出，每塲自下午五時開始。</p>
<h3>國樂演奏第一天</h3>
<p>昨天是國樂演奏的第一天，中秋甫過，已是肅殺的深秋氣候，雖是層雲蔽天，隨時可雨的傍晚，但蘭心門前，卻是車水馬龍的盛況，一般仕女們，都是爲了傾聽國樂演奏而來，同時，也是爲了贊助助學運動而來。五時正，蘭心上下座位告滿。五時半，臺上幕面冉昇，最先與聽衆見面的，是一位報告節目的吳小姐，吳小姐是挽瀾女中的教務長，愛好國樂，今天特地趕來幫忙，擔任每個節目演奏以前的報告，并且對於節目內容略加說明，吳小姐旣然說得一口清晰的國語，前後復換了兩身很入時的服裝，更給予聽衆很好的印象，同時爲國樂演奏會增色不少。國樂演奏員，一律藍袍玄褂，白底黑鞋，演奏時道貌岸然，悉心調弄，每畢一曲，輒向聽衆鞠躬，彬彬有禮，又給予聽衆以良好印象。</p>
<h3>演奏精彩引人入勝</h3>
<p>國樂節目共十曲，其中合奏者，有[懷古]，[潯陽夜月]，[平沙落雁]，[霓裳羽衣曲]，[普庵咒]，[覇王卸甲]等曲，合奏樂器，包括敲擊，吹奏，絲絃數種，節拍調和，韶味深長。獨奏者，有洞蕭獨奏[佛上殿]，瑟琶獨奏[十面埋伏]兩曲，均爲孫裕德先生奏演，瑟琵洞蕭均爲孫君擅長，洵屬多才多藝。洞簫獨奏，配以極微燈光。猶憶蘇子瞻赤壁然，如怨如慕，如泣如訴，餘音嫋嫋，不絕如縷]之句，不竟如歷其景。琵琶獨奏[十里埋伏]，在音調中盡狀項羽垓下之厄，悲壯情景，始則鼓角齊鳴，三軍列陣，點將遣兵，走隊設伏，繼則，交鋒血戰，吶喊震天，終則敗陣奪圍，銜枚疾走。種種情景，於弦索中曲曲傳達，緊張時如萬馬奔騰，淒楚時如鳴咽哀泣。孫君琵琶造詣極深，博得全塲堂聲不少，洵非虛譽也。　　其次，尚有崑曲與舞劍二幕，均屬不可多見之技藝，尤以崑曲佐笛之許百遒君，笛聲清脆而有韶味，笛王之譽，絕非偶然，許君向於梅　華歌崑曲時爲之佐笛，今亦久不吹奏。歌崑曲者爲股朱聞三位三小姐，歌喉婉轉，均負時譽。舞劍爲藥大密先生與濮玉小姐，藥君得李景林將軍嫡傳，劍術憶達爐火純青地步。</p>
<h3>國粹藝術發揚光大</h3>
<p>全部國樂演奏以及崑曲舞劍的兩挿曲，從藝術觀點上言，均已臻於純熟地步，我們對於這一類，在文化上具有悠久歷史的國粹藝術，實有加以提倡發揚之必要。可惜，可實上國人對於國樂的興趣似乎在西樂之次，西樂固然可以研究，但是國樂更值得研究，陶冶性情，啓發智慧，國樂並不在西樂之下，願有志國樂之士努力爲之。</p>

<h3>雷雨（九）</h3>
<p>隆夫這一天晚上，夢見了眞人。　　在六號艇中，坐着眞人，下畑兵曹和隆夫。眞奇怪，擺在潛水學校庭院中的六號艇，突然電動機一響，就滑入水裹去了。　　[唔？]　　隆夫不知不覺發出這樣一聲來。於是眞人的眼珠像要奪眶而出的樣子，像煞有介事地對着隆夫說：　　[你這個傢伙，怎麼到這個潛艇上來了？]　　眞人的聲音因爲過於嚴厲，所以隆夫毛骨辣然地不能作答。然而不久，眞人似乎感覺到了無能挽救的時候，又用很親熱的話說：　　[不要妨碍工作，躱在一個角落裹去吧！因爲非常危險呵！]　　[究竟這是什麼地方呵？]　　[不要說話！現在就知道。]　　眞人只回答了這一點。而緊緊地閉着嘴，在向某種機械察着。　　正在這個當兒，頭頂的海面上，像櫻島爆炸的镕石，連發着雨點般落下來的聲音。這種震聲，很劇烈地震撼着艇殻。隆夫看了一下手錶。　　[是日本的飛機聲。友艇也開始動了。]　　眞人這樣自言自語着，然而不久镕石般的落下聲音，又大起來了。　　[不要錯過時機……]　　咬着下唇的眞人，面孔上表現出像水一樣的冷靜表情。於是對下畑兵曹發了什麼命令後，潛艇就一直沉下去，最後便不動了。　　[眞人……這是作什麼？]　　隆未以爲錯過了時機，而大聲吼呌出來，但眞人像平常一樣表現着微笑，而悠悠自得地與兵曹開始下棋了。　　不知道經過了幾個鑛頭。　　突然一留神，眞人一跳站起來。　　[好，時間到了！]　　他和兵曹的踪影，消逝了。機器的聲音又發作了，而潛艇向海面上傾斜了。　　隆夫深感到了塌天大禍，而吐了一口痰。　　不久，傳來了劇烈的聲音。　　[放！]眞人發號令了。經過了一兩秒的沉默。突然，水裹似乎捲起一種波浪來，而發生了一個大的聲音。又一發……。　　過了不大工夫，眞人面孔上現出充分的喜色來了。　　[隆夫！高興吧！阿利遜型打中了。]　　[好了！]　　隆夫跳起來說：　　[等待一下！軍人在報告尚未完結前，任務不能算完。]　　眞人靜靜地坐在無綫電台前。（一四七）</p>

        <h1>1944.10.03</h1>
<h3>Calm Heads</h3>
<p>After the British and American troops landed in western and southern France, the German army successively retreated to defend its own country. Optimists in Britain and America believed that the fall of Berlin was just a matter of time, and the European war could end immediately. Chongqing, always eager to please, even more vigorously promoted and broadcasted that after the European war was resolved, the Pacific war could also be resolved soon. Speculators in Shanghai, who are accustomed to spreading rumors, fueled the flames and fabricated many lies to deceive everyone and harm the country, in order to achieve their personal goals of making a fortune and enjoying life to the fullest. Unexpectedly, after Churchill returned to England from the Quebec Conference, he reported the results of the conference to the House of Commons on September 28, stating that in military terms, the war could not end immediately, and warning the people not to harbor illusions but to continue their efforts. All optimistic views were swept away. Since the situation in Europe was like this, there was no need to talk about the overall situation in East Asia. We don't know how the optimists in Chongqing and the rumor-mongers in Shanghai will explain this. Churchill's report is the most obvious manifestation of Germany's strength, and the most powerful proof of Germany's strength. Originally, after Germany abandoned western and southern France, it only lost contact with the Mediterranean Sea and the English Channel. Therefore, it could concentrate its army on its homeland and its navy on the North Sea. After the troops were no longer dispersed, it was naturally convenient to exert their strength, and the strength exerted was even greater. This cannot be said to be Germany's predetermined strategy, but it is common sense in military affairs. British and American people who understand this point naturally cannot issue optimistic arguments again. We often remind the people of this point, hoping that the people will use a calm head and judge according to common sense. Our purpose is only to hope that everyone will not be washed away by the waves in this turbulent world, and will not suffer unnecessary sacrifices. Only by holding firm to our ideas, working step by step, and working down-to-earth can we achieve independent self-existence. Chongqing's following the crowd will eventually only lead to [lifting a brick to drop it on one's own foot], and Shanghai's rumor-mongering will first harm the public, and eventually even oneself will not be spared. Being a citizen in a great era, being a knowledgeable citizen, and being a citizen who is beneficial to oneself, to others, and to the country, is the goal of every citizen. How to achieve this goal? The only prerequisite is whether the mind is calm or not. The current world is full of opportunism, speculation, and deception. This is a transitional phenomenon before the wartime system is on the right track. Once it is on the right track, these phenomena will naturally disappear without a trace. The most pitiful are the general public who are deceived and exploited. When the truth is revealed and it is proven that the rumors are not true, they are sacrificed in confusion. It is important to know that the purpose of the speculators and rumor-mongers in Chongqing and Shanghai is only to seek power and enjoyment for a few people. If someone echoes them, their personal plans will succeed. If no one echoes them, their personal plans will fail. But for those who echo them, there is only sacrifice, and nothing else. Those who blindly follow will inevitably embark on the road of sacrifice, which is also natural. The German mystery has now been proven by the anti-Axis Churchill, giving a great blow to the general rumor-mongers, and giving a clear understanding to the general blind people. Other mysteries and other opportunistic things cannot be eliminated immediately at present, so a calm head is even more important, and even more important for the general public.</p>
<h3>Peleliu Continues, Japanese Troops Defend Day and Night, Inflicting Damage on the Enemy, Philippine-Japanese Land and Air Forces Prepare to Exert Their Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese troops on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands are bravely resisting the enemy's material offensive and continuing to fight fiercely day after day. On September 30th, a unit of enemy troops attacked Mount Suifu in the central highlands, but were repulsed by the Japanese troops after a fierce counterattack. Japanese troops on the island continue to launch attacks along the entire line day and night. Bayonet attack squads also go out from time to time, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The attack on the night of the 29th was the most intense. Most of the attack squads broke into the enemy's陣, killing or wounding more than 70 enemy soldiers in the first two groups. The members of the attack隊 still returned safely. After the突擊 campaign was implemented that night, all the enemy's soldiers were frightened. The Japanese army also captured various weapons, ammunition, food and other items. Fierce battles continue on Angaur Island in the Atbus Islands. Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from a certain Japanese base in the central Pacific, Japanese troops on Peleliu Island are fighting bravely day and night, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. According to the report on the war situation of the troops, not only have there been brave戰果 days after day, but also the combat awareness of not stopping until the enemy troops are destroyed is extremely旺盛, and after a unit of elite reinforcements arrived, the combat intent is even more昂揚. After the Japanese增援 troops successfully reinforced the troops, they combined with the garrison troops and immediately went to the front line, engaging the enemy陣 in melee continuously. On the night of the 28th, they divided into several班 and sneaked into the enemy陣, killing many enemy將兵, capturing two mortars and two machine guns, and then leisurely returned to陣地. This newly銳 troops rushed into the enemy陣 on the night of the 29th, killing and wounding more than 290 enemy troops. Moreover, this奇襲 troops returned with several carts fully loaded with enemy ammunition and food. The Japanese troops on Peleliu Island now ensure the陣地 in the central highlands of the island. Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese military experts expressed the following views on the US military's invasion of the Philippines: The US military's invasion of the Philippines in the Pacific will become increasingly露骨. In addition to landing on Peleliu, Angaur, and Morotai islands, they are also repeatedly bombing Japanese air force bases in the Philippines, regardless of losses. However, the Philippines is by no means a small island isolated in the Pacific. A large number of Japanese troops on land are currently執戈待敵, and the Japanese air force is also waiting for the opportunity to arrive at various bases. Therefore, the enemy's企圖 to invade the Philippines is as a big冒險 as the European invasion operation, and it is a great opportunity for the Japanese army to歼敌. The enemy's success in Europe was due to two years of strategic effort, especially in the last half year, when the British and American armies战略 bombed German industrial areas, oil production facilities, and synthetic oil factories day and night. However, Japan's military industry has hardly suffered direct attacks from the enemy army, and the consumption rate of the air force unit is also extremely low. The world is wondering how much combat power Japan will exert when the final battle comes. Although the enemy army is now bombing, its scale is very small. It is neither a strategic bombing nor a tactical bombing, such as attacking naval ships, etc., and is only expecting a temporary effect.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation of the Japanese Army in Various Places</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) The weekly war situation in various parts of East Asia is as follows: ○China (Land Operations) The Japanese army's operations in central and southern China are progressing smoothly. The Japanese army in central China captured Baoqing on the 27th. The Japanese army in southern China occupied the Danbi airfield on the 28th and the Danzhu street on the 29th, and is continuing to attack. The airfield群 in the Guilin area has now lost its function, posing a great threat to the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. In addition, the Japanese troops occupying the vicinity of Wenzhou have ensured the key points in the vicinity. The Japanese troops occupying Lishui have achieved their combat objectives and restored their current strength. (Air Operations) The Japanese Air Force cooperated with ground operations in central and southern China, jointly undertaking air defense of key areas, and attacking Xi'an, Liuzhou, Zhijiang, Liangshan, Chengdu and other places, restraining the enemy's US Air Force's actions. The戰果 from the 21st to the 8th are as follows: 125 aircraft were shot down, destroyed, or set on fire. The enemy US Air Force lost important functions near Guilin, and recently there have been hardly any enemy aircraft coming to attack the戰塲 and the vicinity of Hengyang in central China. ○Manchuria On the 26th, 70-80 enemy aircraft attacked the Anshan, Dalian, and Benxihu areas. When enemy aircraft first attacked the southern Manchuria area, it was on July 29th, and on August 4th, 27th, September 8th, 9th, 26th, and 27th, there were also one or two enemy aircraft reconnaissance attacks, totaling about seven times, reaching 80-90 aircraft. ○Burma After the Japanese army unit on the Nu River completely lifted the siege of Longling on the 11th of last month, they suddenly launched an offensive on the southeast of Mangshi around the 20th. On the 22nd, they fought a寡勢力 battle against the superior enemy forces that had been trying to retake the city since the beginning of June, and successfully contacted the Pingyou garrison troops, thus lifting the siege. At that time, the damage to the enemy was more than 3,000. ○Pacific The enemy troops who landed on Peleliu Island were about two divisions. A part of them landed in嘉爾得羅爾克 on the 25th and in格亞特布斯 Island on the 26th. The Japanese army固守 the key points of the central highlands such as Dongshan, Guance Mountain, Daishan, and Mount Suifu, and fought bloody battles with the enemy day and night, inflicting heavy damage. Due to the large number of dead and wounded, the enemy has been transporting the wounded and killed將士 with hospital ships day after day, which is extremely busy. At the same time, the enemy army is increasing reinforcements on the island in order to launch a large-scale offensive. The total number of空母 dispatched by the enemy army in this campaign has reached more than dozens, including more than ten standardized空母. The enemy兵力 who landed on Angaur Island is about half a division. The Japanese army佔據 the key points of the northwest highlands of the island and fought bravely with them. The enemy troops who landed on Morotai Island were about one division余. They構築 a bridgehead of 20 kilometers wide and about 7 kilometers long. The Japanese army fought with the enemy in melee in various dense forest areas, inflicting heavy damage. In addition, the Japanese army attacked the enemy's landing sites on Morotai Island day after day, obtaining considerable戰果. Since the enemy army landed until the 25th, the Japanese Air Force has重創 one cruiser and one large transport ship, sunk one submarine, and sunk or destroyed about 30-40 landing boats. In addition, one medium-sized transport ship was set on fire, and the enemy's landing site also suffered heavy losses. In the Philippines, it was heard that the most enemy carrier-based aircraft came, reaching 400 on the previous day, and then gradually decreased. Recently, there has been no large-scale bombing. On the contrary, the Japanese Air Force团攻 the enemy空母 in the eastern sea of the Philippines in the morning of the 2nd, dispersing them. The Japanese Air Force is also异常活跃 in the sea area around the western Caroline Islands. At the same time, the enemy Air Force's bombing of Japanese military bases on the Caroline, Philippines, Morotai and other islands is also quite fierce. ○Indian Ocean Since last week, there has been no significant change.</p>

<h3>Thai Air Defense Bureau Announces Northern Region Suffers Air Raids, Vietnamese People Concerned About Guilin Battlefield Situation</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Thai Air Defense Bureau announced the following on the situation of recent enemy aircraft raids in northern Thailand: On the 23rd, 4th, and 6th, several enemy aircraft raided the area of Uttara Dit District around 2 p.m. each day, machine-gunning and bombing, but there were only a few casualties, and the losses were quite light. Also, on the morning of the 24th, around 4 a.m., several old aircraft raided the Ganlai District, destroying some houses, and there were some casualties. Saigon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Vietnam borders Guangxi, so its people are extremely concerned about the war situation in Guilin Province. When Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Mr. Awazawa, visited Governor Degou the other day, he also inquired in detail about the war situation in that area. It is heard that what the Vietnamese people are most concerned about is the indiscriminate bombing of the weak parts of Vietnam by the US Air Force in Guilin. Recently, the US Air Force has been using small aircraft for reconnaissance day after day, and from time to time, two or three aircraft take the opportunity to raid, in addition to destroying military facilities, they also strafe innocent civilian ships. The local residents are deeply angry, but because the Japanese army has now attacked Guangxi, such cruel acts of the US aircraft have had to be restrained. Therefore, the Vietnamese people all hope that the Japanese army will sweep Guangxi as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Good Results Achieved in Increased Japanese Mineral Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Military Supplies Department previously implemented a must-win production increase campaign for important minerals in August and September, seeking the rapid wartime transformation of various minerals. Since the implementation of this measure, it has achieved very good results. In order to ensure continued production increase in the future, new measures are being implemented separately to strongly promote it. Mr. Kagayama, Director of the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau, who is responsible for this important task, specially issued the following statement: The results in August, when the production increase period began, were slightly inferior, but the situation gradually improved thereafter, and the results were extremely satisfactory. During that time, some mining areas suffered disasters due to wind, rain, and heat, but the overall results were extremely good, which is very gratifying. Although the final statistics for August and September are not yet clear, based on the recent situation, copper is about 20% higher, lead is more than 30%, zinc is 10%, and other iron ore, mercury,　, manganese, asbestos, etc., also show extremely good results. In particular, the increased production of asbestos鉾 has exceeded the planned target, reaching more than twice the amount. The harvest of the production increase period last year also showed extremely good results.</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Wartime Religious Patriotic Association</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Three hundred thousand religious professionals in Japan have organized the Great Japan Wartime Religious Patriotic Association in order to stand up for the country. At 3:00 p.m. on the 30th, about 200 representatives of various religions and officials from the Ministry of Education gathered at the Great East Asia Hall.

All religious professionals in Japan, regardless of Shinto Buddhism or Christianity, all aim to serve the country religiously, unite together, and cooperate to complete the war.</p>
<h3>The Failure of the Bombay Talks Affects Britain the Most</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Gandhi-Jinnah talks broke down on the 6th of last month. In this talk, Jinnah firmly advocated [Partition before Independence], while Gandhi advocated [Whether or not to Partition before Independence, must be decided by a people’s vote], and the British advocated [The conflict between Hindus and Muslims must be resolved first, before discussions with the British government on Indian independence can commence]. The above three points seemed to be on the same track, but the Bombay talks, rather than being a conference on the Hindu-Muslim issue between Gandhi and Jinnah, were more like a conciliation conference between Britain and Gandhi. Some even believe that it was a conference where Gandhi fawned over Britain. As for the reasons for the breakdown, although not very detailed, it can be known from Jinnah’s statement that Gandhi has always insisted that the issue of Partition before Independence must be decided by a people’s vote, and this was the main reason for the breakdown of the talks. Gandhi’s compromise plan for the Muslims was indeed very reasonable, so the Muslims outwardly expressed their joy, but inwardly they harbored strong cases that did not lead to a breakdown. Gandhi’s private proposal to Britain for the establishment of an Indian national government, although similar to the Cripps’ proposal, still had some points that stimulated Britain, so it is doubtful whether Gandhi and Britain truly reached a compromise. Gandhi can no longer be driven by Britain, but what is Gandhi’s purpose? Observing India’s reaction will immediately become clear. Regardless of whether the breakdown of this talk was a political failure for Gandhi or Jinnah’s greatest blunder, the one most affected was actually Britain. However, a part of the central political circles in India has recently been quite impatient with the compromise with Britain. With Gandhi’s wisdom, he will certainly never give up his long-cherished wish of expelling Britain from India, and will endure humiliation and compromise. However, what means will Gandhi take in the future? Judging from Spabas’ criticism, [The leaders of the Indian national movement never stop for a moment regarding their mission], Gandhi, after being released from prison, will certainly not sit idly by. However, what contribution will Gandhi make in India? The Bombay talks and other breakdowns have further revealed Gandhi’s attitude.</p>

<h3>Measures for Foreign Medical Personnel to Apply for Certificates are Limited to Countries with Medical Reciprocity</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - There are many foreign doctors practicing medicine in various parts of China. However, whether foreign doctors and their medical practitioners in China are issued certificates in accordance with the law, and how the situation is handled, has attracted much attention. Therefore, the reporter specially visited the Director of the Ministry of Health, Mr. Lu Runzhi, to inquire about everything, and he told us: [Those who apply for the issuance of certificates from the Ministry for foreign medical practitioners in China are limited to people from countries that have signed medical reciprocity agreements, in accordance with the Doctor Law promulgated by the National Government on February 1st of this year. The friendly country of Germany has recently officially informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the German Embassy, which has been forwarded to the Ministry, recognizing that medical practitioners in our country have the right to practice in Germany. Since that country has a spirit of reciprocity towards medical practitioners in our country, the Ministry has also specially processed applications for certificates from German medical practitioners in China. However, all application documents must be sent by the German Embassy to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the Ministry for review. This method has already been implemented by the Ministry, which has sent the application documents to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for transfer to the German Embassy for verification.]</p>

<h3>Japanese Main Force Approaches Xing'an, US Air Force Acknowledges Fall of Danzhu</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Chongqing, the US Air Force Command stationed in Chongqing issued a communiqué on the 1st, confirming that the US Air Force forward base of Danzhu in southern China had fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. However, the Chongqing Military Commission's announcement did not mention this, only stating that the Japanese army was advancing south along the Xiang-Gui Railway, and that its main force was currently advancing to the vicinity of Jiemeng in the northeast of Xing'an, and Lishi Square and Jiukuaida in the southeast. It further acknowledged that the crisis in Xing'an, the last stronghold defending Guilin, was becoming more and more urgent.</p>
<h3>Wuzhou Has Become a Pile of Rubble</h3>
<p>Wuzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Because the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing implemented a scorched earth tactic, Wuzhou has now become a pile of rubble. According to the residents of the ruined area, the US Air Force saw that the Japanese army was attacking along both banks of the West River, and Wuzhou was in danger, so they fled first. The local officials of Chongqing strictly ordered the citizens to evacuate before the 10th of September, and those who disobeyed were beaten. The people had no choice but to obey and flee to the mountains. However, the US Air Force actually sent five aircraft on the 21st and 22nd, before the Japanese army entered the city, to drop high-performance bombs everywhere, and scattered a large number of incendiary bombs, and even strafed with machine guns indiscriminately. As a result, fires broke out everywhere in the city, and because it was dry and dry, the fire spread and could not be suppressed. It burned throughout the city for four days and three nights, and the entire city was destroyed. After the Japanese army entered the city, the citizens returned one after another, and saw the Japanese army engaging in relief work for the disaster victims in the scorched earth. They could not help but suddenly realize who the enemy of the Chinese people was. Southern China Front, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The scorched earth tactic has completely turned Wuzhou into ruins. Whether military facilities or civilian houses in the city, they were bombed several times by Chongqing-US aircraft when the Chongqing army retreated. There are almost no solid houses left. The wharf area along the West River has also been turned into rubble. However, after the Japanese army occupied Wuzhou, they immediately began construction work. The propaganda隊 and the gendarmerie隊 issued Good Citizen Certificates to the returning residents and handled other work to restore public order, and the復興 of the city, etc., are unusually active.</p>
<h3>Southwest People Cooperate with the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Southern China Base, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The large-scale operation launched by the Japanese army in southwestern China this time is a major change that has never happened before on the Chinese front. Southwestern China is the driving force behind Chongqing's war of resistance finance. In particular, the US Air Force in Chongqing has established a strong base in the area to stir up trouble. However, this Japanese army's attack will not only destroy Chongqing's anti-Japanese base, but also the forward base of the US Air Force in Chongqing. What is particularly noteworthy about this operation is that the Chongqing army's will to resist Japan has been significantly reduced, the people's cooperation with the Japanese army has become more active, and their resentment towards the US military has deepened. Since the Japanese army began its operations, it has hardly encountered any major resistance. Deqing, which was captured by the Japanese army on the 20th of last month, had its field warehouses and equipment warehouses filled with military supplies, and they were not burned or evacuated, but fled. The city was also hardly destroyed, which shows the generally low morale of the Chongqing army. In addition, the various forces of the 35th Army Group, which the Chongqing army boasts as the strongest, are only deployed in small units on the resistance line to avoid consumption, and the main forces have retreated. What is most strange is the thorough cooperation of the people in the newly occupied areas with the Japanese army. For example, during the river-crossing operation in Xinxingjiang, the local residents gathered dozens of civilian ships to cooperate with the Japanese army. These are all facts of the people's cooperation. This shows that the people have understood the true intentions of the Japanese army, and this trend has spread throughout the areas under Chongqing's rule.</p>

<h3>Balkan War Enters Initial Stage</h3>
<p>German Forces Concentrate Large Army to Strengthen Defense Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - German authorities announced on the 1st that German forces in the Balkans are currently regrouping a large-scale force, but the timing of how German forces will form a new battle line is not yet specified. Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Universal News Agency reports: A new eastern front has formed on both sides of the Iron Gate of the Danube River in the Balkans, and the combat situation there was mentioned for the first time in yesterday's German war report. The important strategic significance of the German operations in this area lies in preventing the Soviet forces from breaking into Serbia. The purpose of the Soviet offensive is to cut off the German forces in the Aegean Sea region. The battle is currently in its initial stage. Fierce fighting is taking place in the Arad and Turda areas.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Romanian-Hungarian Border</h3>
<p>Strong Soviet forces launched an offensive from Romanian territory, attacking the city of Szeged in eastern Hungary. In the past 24 hours, German-Hungarian allied forces have not only contained their momentum but have also recaptured Kis Zombor between Arad and Szeged in fierce fighting. They have also entered Mrko from the west. North of Yvarad, they have entered Hungarian territory. After the German forces reached the border, they broke through the Soviet-Romanian line. Soviet forces attempted to cross the Milches River in Szekler. Thirty-seven vessels were heavily bombarded by German artillery, resulting in many Soviet drownings. The Soviet forces only managed to establish a small bridgehead after four consecutive attempts to cross the river.</p>
<h3>Three Strategic Objectives of the Soviet Army</h3>
<p>Budapest, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to front-line intelligence: The Soviet forces on the southeastern European front tend to shift to a full-scale offensive, and the work of strengthening the defensive line of the German-Hungarian allied forces is also progressing steadily. The Soviet army's goals are roughly as follows: ○ Invade Slovakia, ○ Occupy the Hungarian Plain, ○ Attack the Adriatic coast from Serbia and Macedonia, isolating the German forces in the south, ○ Subdue Greece and Turkey. The main battle locations are currently three: ○ Secure the Dukla Pass on the northeastern border of Slovakia, ○ Invade the Razsa Plain between Oradea and Makó on the Hungarian-Romanian border, ○ Operations at the Iron Gate in Serbia. However, the most important Dukla Pass in the Carpathians is still under German control. The passes in the Carpathian Mountains will become impassable due to snowfall in about a month, causing great anxiety to the Soviet forces. The offensive on the Razsa and Oradea-Makó plains will determine the fate of Hungary. On the other hand, the Soviet forces are operating in Outer Transylvania from the Bucharest area to defend the flanks of the rear lines of communication. The Soviet offensive was repulsed by German forces. The defense of the German forces in the Banat area from Makó to the Iron Gate is very strong, and fierce battles are unfolding between the German and Soviet forces. In Serbia and Macedonia, the German forces are engaged in chaotic battles with the Bulgarian and Tito forces advancing northward from Greece. The weather in this area will be severely cold in a month, making combat difficult. The above three aspects of combat are sufficient to show the rapidly escalating situation on the southeastern European front.</p>
<h3>German Forces Abandon Moon Island in the North</h3>
<p>On the northern front, Soviet forces attacking between Twena and the Gulf of Riga were repulsed. Moon Island (ls. Moon), after fierce fighting, was ultimately lost due to the disparity in military strength. Apart from the operations to suppress Polish insurgents in the Warsaw area, there were no major battles on the central front.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union is Concerned About the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Moscow, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Union's Pravda published an article on the 30th discussing the Pacific War, stating the importance of the Japanese military situation and explaining Japan's preparations for a decisive battle involving both the front and the rear. It concluded that the transformation of the Pacific War situation is imminent. The newspaper's commentary is the same as the commentary published by [War and Labor Newspaper] on September 15 and the Pacific War situation published by [Red Fleet] on September 23. It can prove that the Soviet Union is very concerned about the recent Pacific War situation, and the Moscow diplomatic community has paid attention to this point.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Devouring the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>We don't need grand or heroic words at the moment; what we need is the spirit of devouring the enemy. This spirit must be a spirit shared by 100 million people. The most important of these is the spirit of the guiding leaders who are enlightened and perceptive. Especially important is the spirit of those who stand in important positions of national politics and those who shoulder important military responsibilities.</p>
<p>There is a popular saying now, namely, "total national armament." But what do we use to arm ourselves? The main armament is the spirit of devouring the enemy. That is, the spirit of full confidence in each issue. It is said that this spirit is ignited from below, but we believe that this spirit must be ignited from below through the guidance of the above. If the generals and ministers in power in a country wait for the spirit below to burn before taking action, this is a big mistake. In any democratic society, the masses must be guided by leaders. At the time when He Shi smashed the cauldrons and sank the boats to fight to the death, what determined the survival of the nation was even more the spirit of the leader. Ancient famous generals all said that victory or defeat depended on one person's emotions.</p>
<p>The general public in society says to confront quantity with quantity, iron with iron, and airplanes with airplanes. It is right for specialists to say this. For example, aircraft manufacturers, whether in terms of performance or quantity, must surpass the enemy. All are engaged in their own positions with the determination not to lose to the enemy. However, this is by no means the origin for the entire Japanese nation. If the people all believe that victory or defeat is determined by the amount of matter, then the Greater East Asia War will certainly not have occurred. Before this war was launched, everyone knew that the quantity of Anglo-Saxons far exceeded that of Japan countless times. However, regardless of this obvious and well-known fact, our Japan actually promulgated the edict of holy war. This is ultimately because Japan relies on something else, not just the amount of matter.</p>
<p>We will never ignore the amount of matter, nor will we despise it. However, war cannot be carried out by relying solely on the amount of matter. For this reason, please see the recent fourth American bombing of northern Kyushu, when Lieutenant Endo shot down five enemy planes with a single plane, which is enough to prove that victory or defeat does not depend on the amount of matter.</p>
<p>Currently, the entire country of Japan is loudly calling out that there are not enough airplanes. The slogan "Make airplanes quickly!" resounds across the world. I think this remedy is not only very effective, but also too effective. According to government authorities, Japan's aircraft production is definitely no less than the second place among the world's major powers. And the performance of the aircraft can be said to be superior to everything without shame. To take a step back, it is never inferior to other countries. The only regret today is that its effectiveness has not been fully utilized. I believe that this hidden worry will be resolved in the near future.</p>
<p>Therefore, what we need to emphasize again today is to promote the spirit of devouring the enemy. In particular, we should promote the spirit of devouring the enemy among national government officials and the heads of the army and navy. One person's heart is the heart of millions of people. If the authorities carry out their tasks with unwavering faith in victory, then the people will surely burn with a belief in victory like crazy.</p>
<p>During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, regarding the selection of the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, I and others recognized that it should be Admiral Higashigo of the Navy. However, Minister of the Navy Yamamoto promoted Admiral Togo, the commander of the Maizuru Naval District, who was about to retire to the reserves, and proposed him to the Emperor. Higashigo and Yamamoto were close friends. Higashigo had never dreamed of such an unexpected thing. When it finally became a reality, he went to Yamamoto's house and directly started negotiations. But Yamamoto said to Higashigo very simply: "You have a good reason to be angry. But your wisdom is excessive, and your strategies are too many. That's why I recommended Togo, who has the courage of a single wisdom." Togo was consistent and had the spirit of devouring the enemy. He reported to the Emperor his determination to destroy the enemy to reassure the imperial heart. This is by no means an exaggeration. The belief in victory, that is, the spirit of devouring the enemy, made him submit such a memorial. Masashige, when he visited Emperor Go-Daigo at Kasagi, said: "As long as Masashige has one breath left, he will never trouble the Emperor," which is essentially the same idea as Togo.</p>
<p>We do not believe that the amount of matter is useless. It is just that the amount of matter alone cannot determine victory or defeat. To give a very common example, people often like to talk about the duel between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojiro. Kojiro flaunted the four-foot-long katana that everyone in Bizen knew, while Musashi, when he came to the ring from Bakan, brought a paddle that he had shaved into a wooden sword, and he took this wooden sword to meet him. However, in the official duel, the wooden sword made from a paddle killed the opponent. That's not to say that weapons are useless. If possible, naturally use effective weapons as much as possible. However, weapons are used by people, and people are not used by weapons.</p>
<p>Consider Oda Nobunaga's Okehazama. Imagawa's army was said to be 50,000 strong. Nobunaga's troops were at most less than 3,000. Nobunaga's veteran generals and old retainers all advised Nobunaga not to launch a reckless war. However, Nobunaga attacked Yoshimoto's headquarters with lightning speed and killed Yoshimoto. There are many such things in China. For example, in the Battle of Red Cliffs, Cao Cao's army was said to number in the millions. The rulers and ministers of Eastern Wu changed color and prepared to surrender. However, Zhou Yu, Lu Su, and others advocated a battle, and finally burned Cao's camp for eight hundred miles.</p>
<p>To give another clichéd example of the Greco-Persian Wars. Although clichéd, the facts are still facts. Xerxes I gathered most of the army of West Asia to invade Greece. But the small Greek army defeated them on land and sea, sending them fleeing in disarray.</p>
<p>Let's take another look at the Mongol invasion of Japan. Murata Seifu composed a song praising it:</p>
<p>May I ask, what is the heart of the people of Japan?</p>
<p>They beheaded the Mongol envoy Tokimune in an instant.</p>
<p>What a wonderfully exhilarating song! The reason why Tokimune was Tokimune lies entirely in this point. He did not initially act unilaterally to assassinate the Mongol envoys. He petitioned the court and was entrusted before beheading them. At the first cabinet meeting, it was decided not to write a reply. But later it was decided to reply. After the draft was completed, it was submitted to Kamakura, and Tokimune's opinion was solicited. Tokimune was consistent and insisted on the opinion of the initial cabinet meeting, not to write a reply. Therefore, the draft reply was kept in Kamakura and not given to the Mongol envoys. Tokimune followed the policy that had been decided by the meeting and had the determination to complete it decisively. In fact, the reason why Tokimune was Tokimune lies in the spirit of devouring the enemy. This spirit permeated from the generals at the front to the general public, and thus the entire nation burned with the spirit of devouring the enemy.</p>
<p>We do not have enough space to detail the history of the Mongol invasion of our country. However, far exceeding what we imagine today, the enemy's momentum was huge, while we were stretched thin and had nothing. In terms of the amount of matter, our Japan was no match. This point is explained in great detail in the contemporary record [Irihatagudōshū]. At that time, Japan had no military organization. Since the Genpei War, it was all about fighting in single combat on horseback. But the enemy had a formation. The brave could not advance alone, and the timid could not retreat alone. They advanced and retreated completely according to orders, and they wanted to encircle the undisciplined Japanese soldiers from both wings. Moreover, the enemy's weapons were far superior to those of Japan. The Irihatagudōshū has the following record:</p>
<p>"Although the Mongol arrows are short, the arrowheads are coated with poison, and death occurs from poisoning upon contact. The spears are long and do not loosen. They are lined up in unison. If anyone approaches, the center retreats, and the two ends come together to form an encirclement and kill them. (Omission) They are light-bodied and good at riding, strong and unafraid of death, powerful and brave, and infinitely free. The command is as desired. The general stands in a high place. If they retreat, they beat the retreat drum. If they are in suspense, they beat the drum of censure. Thus, they advance and retreat without confusion. When fleeing, they fire cannons, causing the sky to be dark and the earth to be black. The sound is loud, causing the heart to be lost, the liver to be lost, the eyes to be dizzy, and the ears to be blocked, and they are at a loss as to where to go. The Japanese army does not care about fame or profit, as if it were a personal victory or defeat. Once the armies meet in this battle, hands and feet move, competing to advance and fearing to fall behind, capturing and killing forward. In this way, the Japanese break through the mountains and the sea, rushing forward alone."</p>
<p>Thus, it can be seen that the Japanese soldiers not only had no weapons, but also no tactics. At the same time, Japan had less cooperation than the other side. This point is very clear in the documents written by Tokimune. That is, in July of the first year of Kenji, it can also be known from the instructions of the Kamakura general written to Ōtomo Yoriyasu, who was changed to the shugo post:</p>
<p>"When foreign robbers came to invade last year, it was often heard that some people advanced to the battlefield but did not fight, and some people called themselves defenders of the territory but did not rush forward, which resulted in the imposition of the crime of great treason. From now on, anyone who does not keep faith will be subject to the death penalty. I hope the people understand this and put it into practice."</p>
<p>Here, it can also be seen that among the lords of Kyushu, some people initially advanced to the battlefield but did not fight, and some even called themselves defenders of the territory but did not send troops to the battlefield. In other words, the army at that time could not be talked about as being loyal and brave. They defended their own territory and did not move. Even if they reluctantly went to the battlefield, they did not engage the enemy. Their attitude can be described as cowardly and conciliatory.</p>

<h3>Method for Restricting the Free Movement of Rice Within the Sales Line in the Urban Area Applies to Entry and Exit of the Blockade Line</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Association issued a notice on the 27th of last month prohibiting the movement of rice grains weighing more than eight kilograms. Various sectors found the notice difficult to understand because it did not specify the area. The Central News Agency reporter inquired with relevant parties and learned that the above-mentioned restriction on the amount of transport only applies to the entry and exit of the blockade line in the suburbs of the city. The quantity of rice transported by citizens within the blockade line is not subject to the quantity restrictions in the notice.</p>
<h3>Drastic Price Fluctuations Authorities Conduct Thorough Investigation of Hoarding and Speculation Stimulating Rising Winds</h3>
<p>The price of goods in the city has recently been abnormal, especially the market prices of rice and oil, which are related to people's livelihoods, have fluctuated greatly. The Central News Agency reporter recently learned from various parties that this trend is mostly caused by human factors. If there were no capitalists buying in advance and speculators hoarding, there would never have been drastic rising winds. According to reports from the Rice Control Association and the Oil and Grain Control Association,</p>
<h3>This Year's Autumn Harvest is Bountiful in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The area along the Yangtze River in Central China is a rice-producing area. Except for the Jiangbei area, which is rich in miscellaneous grains, and Zhejiang Province, which produces slightly less rice, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces are areas with abundant rice production. The annual output not only enables self-sufficiency, but also can be transported to neighboring provinces for relief. Since this summer and autumn, the weather has been favorable. The rice ears are growing very well in Wuhu, Tongxian, Lujiang, Bengbu, Mingguang, and Yuxikou in Anhui Province, Jiangning County, Linghuaiguan in Jiangsu Province, and Wuxi, Changzhou, Jintan, Changshu, Suzhou, Kunshan, Songjiang, the four suburbs of Shanghai, Qingpu, Qingdong, and Punan along the Shanghai-Nanjing Line. The new rice in various regions has been appearing on the market one after another. Compared with last year's harvest, it has exceeded by 30% to 40%. The Rice Control Association has set up offices in various major producing areas such as Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and Wuhu to adjust prices, strengthen the purchase of rice grains, and enrich the needs of household rice distribution in the future. At this time when the new rice is appearing on the market, the authorities are also preparing to enrich household rice distribution. The price of rice should have fallen, but recently it has risen instead. It has been found that local farmers and merchants are controlling the price of rice and are unwilling to sell it, and Shanghai merchants are buying and storing it. According to statistics, the rice stored by Shanghai merchants can meet the needs of half a year. However, this stored rice is all in the hands of wealthy people. Therefore, although there is a lot of rice stored in Shanghai, the poor citizens are buying high-priced rice every day because they have no surplus grain reserves, and they are suffering greatly. It is hoped that the authorities will not underestimate this problem.</p>
<h3>Assist in Thorough Investigation of Edible Oil Hoarding</h3>
<p>The market price of edible oil is more than half as high as it was two weeks ago. The reason for this is that the source has been scarce in recent months, but the inventory is very sufficient, which can meet the needs of the city for three months. However, general edible oil merchants falsely report the amount of inventory they have registered and refuse to sell it. The same industry mutually increases the selling price. The Oil and Grain Control Association is now actively trying to request the authorities to dredge the source of Dalian soybean oil. On the one hand, it is collecting funds to purchase miscellaneous grains, preparing to designate commissioned merchants to produce oil production, and planning to unify the transportation and production management of edible oil and miscellaneous grains. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of edible oil supply and demand in the future. Regarding the crackdown on hoarders of edible oil, the Economic Security Office will also assist in the thorough investigation. It is hoped that the general public will not panic and buy and store at will, and will try their best to suppress the rising winds.</p>
<h3>The Collection and Delivery of Tuition Fees by Municipal Schools is a Set Procedure</h3>
<p>Director Dai Issues a Statement The Central News Agency reporter yesterday specifically visited Director Dai of the Education Bureau to inquire about the increase in salaries for faculty and staff of municipal schools and the collection of tuition fees. The reply was as follows: After taking over on September 1, I immediately appealed to the Mayor to increase the salaries of faculty and staff of municipal schools. The Mayor agreed to increase them in September. The bureau has compiled an estimate, which is largely completed, and will be submitted to the municipal government for approval within days. As for the collection of fees from municipal primary and secondary schools, the interim measures were originally handled by the previous Director Lin. They were submitted to the municipal government on July 1, and a notice was issued to various schools on August 16 to comply. Article 15 of the measures states: "Each school shall submit a statement of tuition fee income, along with the middle and stub blank forms of the tuition fee receipts, to the Municipal Education Bureau within one month after the start of the school year (limited to before September 25 in the autumn). Schools that fail to comply with the deadline will have their funding deducted. Funds will only be replenished after the procedures have been completed." Article 16 states: "The tuition fees collected by each school and submitted to the bureau shall be used by the Municipal Education Bureau to formulate a distribution plan, which shall be submitted to the municipal government for approval and distribution." The municipal government instructed that the above measures should be followed. As for the proposal to reserve the collected tuition fees from municipal schools for supplementing and raising the salaries of faculty and staff, according to accounting procedures, they should first be deposited into the treasury, and then a request should be submitted for approval and allocation when they are used, in order to comply with regulations. The Director personally understands the difficult lives of the faculty and staff of various schools, and the increase in salaries for the current semester is being handled. It is inevitable that faculty and staff will have loan advances, etc. Therefore, the above measures have been slightly changed. Schools are allowed to submit 75% of the tuition fees collected before the deadline, and the remainder will be temporarily retained as a loan reserve fund for employee salaries. Once the distribution plan is approved by the municipal government, each school will be notified in multiple batches according to the exact amount to be distributed. This is a factual matter. The request to the municipal government to increase teachers' salaries is one matter, and the submission of tuition fees by each school and then the receipt of funds in multiple batches is another matter. The Director only knows how to perform his duties in accordance with the law. All schools should deeply understand this purpose and comply. Furthermore, the Director has room for research on the past methods of collecting tuition fees. The Director proposes that they should be collected by government banks on behalf of the bureau, which would not only avoid troubling the schools, but also simplify the bureau's collection, delivery, and distribution. This will be submitted to the municipal government for handling next semester.</p>
<h3>Survey of Electricity Consumption by Factories to Begin</h3>
<p>Since last month, the Municipal Economic Bureau has been conducting registration of the production and electricity consumption of factories throughout the city, and the progress has been relatively smooth. It is reported that the bureau has sent letters to the Public Works Bureau and the China Central Water and Electricity Company to select representatives to form three investigation teams of three people each to investigate the registered manufacturers. (A) ○ Monthly production volume, ○ Monthly actual sales volume, ○ Consumption per horsepower of each motor per hour (how many hours of work per day), ○ How many items are produced per kilowatt. (B) Types of Investigation ○ Mechanical (including metal repair), ○ Chemical (including medicines, soap, glass, etc.), ○ Food (including bread, rice, noodles, sweets, etc.), ○ Textile (textiles, sweat shirts, dyeing, etc.), ○ Cultural (printing, stationery), ○ Electrical (power poles, wires), ○ Rubber, ○ Sawmills, ○ Tobacco, ○ Laundry, ○ Other. It is reported that the members of the investigation team are all specialized technical personnel who will soon begin to investigate the production factories and provide guidance. Once the investigation is completed, they will be given an allocation of electricity to facilitate increased production.</p>
<h3>Police Inspection Team Departs North Yesterday</h3>
<p>In order to actively improve police administration in this city, the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has specially dispatched five individuals, including Lin Ji, the Director of the General Affairs Department; Kenkichi Ninomiya, the Deputy Director of the Inspection Department; Peng Ziqing Tsujikatsukaku, the Chief Inspector; and Chen Jisheng, to form a police inspection team. They will travel to Manchuria, Beijing, Tianjin, and other locations to inspect police administration for reference. They departed yesterday (the 2nd). During the inspection period, the affairs of the General Affairs Department will be handled by the Deputy Director, Akikazu Nakano, and the affairs of the Deputy Director of the Inspection Department will be handled by Keiroh Tota, an expert in reward and punishment inspection.</p>
<h3>Autumn Holiday Ends, Qianzhuang Resumes Business Today</h3>
<p>Following the Mid-Autumn Festival settlement this year, various industries safely navigated through it. Banks, qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks), and securities markets, having completed their holiday closures, have all reopened for business today (the 3rd).</p>
<h3>Overtime Business Operations: Police Department Penalizes, Iven Thye and Falence Ordered to Close</h3>
<p>The Administrative Office of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department has been enforcing restrictions on business hours. Based on investigations by various police precinct offices, more than thirty shops were found to be violating regulations by operating past permitted hours. These shops were penalized according to regulations. It has come to light that in September, over seventy establishments, including nightclubs, dance halls, cafes, and restaurants, were found to be operating overtime. Upon verification, penalties were issued. Specifically, three nightclubs, including Iven Thye, Falence, and Argentina, were ordered to close down and cease operations. Mary Wide was fined. In the dance hall category, six establishments, including Dahua and Xinhua, were warned. In the night garden category, Dumei Night Garden received a warning. In the bar category, five establishments, including the International Bar, were warned. In the restaurant category, forty-two establishments, including the Xin San He Lou, were warned or had their electricity supply suspended. Eight other stores, including Ye Biji, were also warned. It is also reported that if any overtime operations are discovered in the future, more severe penalties will be imposed upon verification.</p>
<h3>Yichang Bridge Repair and Opening</h3>
<p>The Yichang Road Bridge, spanning the Suzhou Creek, is the only transportation artery connecting the western district of Shanghai with Zhabei. The bridge's structure is purely wooden. It sustained significant damage during the Battle of Shanghai. As the city gradually recovered, the Japanese military hired workers to slightly repair the bridge and restore traffic to meet transportation needs. However, it has not been renovated in the past five or six years, leading to the increasing deterioration of its components. At the end of 1943, the Japanese Shanghai Naval Special Landing Forces sent a letter to the former First District Public Works Bureau, requesting the bridge to be thoroughly repaired. After careful consideration, the Bureau decided to renovate it. However, due to financial constraints at the time, the original wood was reused, except for parts that were irreparably damaged. Work commenced on July 20th of this year and has now been fully completed. It was reopened to traffic on September 20th, greatly facilitating travel for the citizens.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Authorities Establish Mobile Command Units</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that the alarm loudspeakers installed in all public places in the city are not yet complete, and confusion often arises when alarms are issued, the city's air defense authorities are strengthening air defense operations with a firm belief. They have established mobile command units to instruct the public on the use of loudspeakers. In the future, they will seek support from the telephone company to use telephone lines to transmit unified announcements throughout the city via wired radio when alarms are issued.</p>
<h3>Huashan Police Precinct Reorganizes Baojia System</h3>
<p>The Huashan Road Police Precinct has completed the issuance of residence permits. Approximately 78,416 people in six Lianbao (joint security groups) have obtained new permits. The seventh and eighth Lianbao will be processed after the application forms are received. The head of the Baojia Section of the precinct was recently transferred from the General Affairs Section of the Lujiawan Precinct, Wu Daoyi. After assuming office, Wu discovered that there were instances of hired substitutes in the Self-Defense Corps within the district, leading to numerous abuses and contradicting the spirit of service. Additionally, most of the Baojia alarm bells in the district had deteriorated over time. He believed that they urgently needed repair and that the precinct should take unified control of them. The head has reported these matters for correction.</p>
<h3>Increased Postage for Parcels and Small Packages</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Bureau announced the revised rates for domestic parcels and small packages: "The rates for domestic parcels and small packages were previously announced by this Bureau in Notice No. 1810 on March 3rd of this year. It is now decided that from October 1st of this year, the rates for all domestic parcels and small packages will be increased by 150% of the current rates. The surcharge per package will be increased from 2 yuan to 10 yuan."</p>

<h3>Suzhou Sojourning Elementary School Scholarship Extended for Half a Month and Expanded Regionally</h3>

<h3>Supporting the Scholarship Movement</h3>
<p>In recent years, the most successful social undertaking in Shanghai has been the scholarship movement. "Scholarship" has become widespread, vigorous, and enthusiastically promoted. On one hand, this is due to the efforts and advocacy of the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers. On the other hand, it is due to the enthusiastic support of people from all walks of life. Contributing money and effort, and cooperating in division of labor, can be said to be a model of grassroots movement. The support from people from all walks of life can be seen in the scholarship donation reports published daily in the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao. Secondly, there are those who save on customary etiquette to donate to scholarships, and those who contribute materials or skills to help scholarships. Although the methods and amounts of donations vary, the enthusiasm for scholarships is consistent. Observing the widespread and enthusiastic promotion of the scholarship movement further feels like a reflection of the bright future of the country. Recently, Mr. Zhang Bangduo and Mr. Liu Zemin of the Linhua Bank in this city have also enthusiastically supported the scholarship movement by jointly organizing a Chinese and Western music concert with the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao newspapers. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be allocated to the scholarship funds of the two newspapers. The concert is divided into Chinese and Western music groups. The Chinese music group will be performed by the Chinese Music Research Association on October 2nd and 3rd (today is the last day of the Chinese music performance, tickets can be purchased at the Lanxin Theater). The Western music group will be performed by the National Academy of Music on October 5th and 6th. All performances will be held at the Lanxin Grand Theater, starting at 5:00 PM each day.</p>
<h3>First Day of Chinese Music Performance</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Chinese music performance. The Mid-Autumn Festival had just passed, and it was already the bleak climate of late autumn. Although the sky was covered with clouds and it looked like it could rain at any time, the front of Lanxin Theater was crowded with people. Most of the ladies came to listen to the Chinese music performance, and at the same time, to support the scholarship movement. At 5:00 PM, the seats at Lanxin Theater were full. At 5:30 PM, the curtain on the stage slowly rose. The first person to meet the audience was Miss Wu, who introduced the program. Miss Wu is the Dean of Studies at Wanlan Girls' High School. She loves Chinese music and came to help today, introducing each program before the performance and briefly explaining the content of the program. Miss Wu not only spoke clear Mandarin but also changed into two very fashionable outfits, giving the audience a good impression and adding to the splendor of the Chinese music concert. The Chinese music performers were all dressed in blue robes and dark jackets, with white-soled black shoes. They looked dignified and carefully played their instruments. After each piece, they bowed to the audience in a courteous manner, giving the audience a good impression.</p>
<h3>Wonderful Performance Captivates the Audience</h3>
<p>There were a total of ten Chinese music programs, including ensemble pieces such as [Reminiscences of the Past], [Moonlit Night on the Xunyang River], [Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank], [Song of Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Coat], [Pu'an Charm], and [Farewell My Concubine]. The ensemble instruments included percussion, wind, and string instruments. The rhythm was harmonious, and the melodies were profound. The solo performances included the Dongxiao solo [Buddha's Ascent to the Temple] and the Seppa solo [Ambush from All Sides], both performed by Mr. Sun Yude. Sun is proficient in both Seppa and Dongxiao and is truly versatile. The Dongxiao solo was accompanied by very dim lighting. It recalled Su Shi's description of the Red Cliff: "like complaining, like yearning, like weeping, like lamenting, the lingering sound lingers on, endlessly," as if experiencing the scene. The Pipa solo [Ambush from All Sides] fully depicted the plight of Xiang Yu at Gaixia in the melody, with a tragic scene. At first, the drums and horns sounded together, the three armies lined up, the generals ordered the soldiers, the teams marched, and ambushes were set. Then, there was a bloody battle, with shouts shaking the sky. Finally, the battle was lost, and the encirclement was broken. The various scenes were vividly conveyed in the strings, as tense as ten thousand horses galloping, and as sorrowful as weeping and sobbing. Sun's pipa skills were very profound, earning him a lot of applause from the entire audience, which was by no means an exaggeration. Secondly, there were two scenes of Kunqu Opera and sword dance, both of which were rare skills. In particular, Mr. Xu Baiqiu, who accompanied the Kunqu Opera with the flute, had a clear and rhythmic flute sound. The reputation of the flute king was by no means accidental. Xu used to accompany Mei Lanfang when she sang Kunqu Opera, but he has not played for a long time. The singers of the Kunqu Opera were three young ladies from the Zhu family, whose singing voices were melodious and well-reputed. The sword dance was performed by Mr. Yao Dami and Miss Pu Yu. Yao was a direct disciple of General Li Jinglin, and his swordsmanship had reached a superb level.</p>
<h3>Promoting and Carrying Forward National Art</h3>
<p>The entire Chinese music performance and the two interludes of Kunqu Opera and sword dance have reached a sophisticated level from an artistic point of view. We must promote and carry forward this kind of national art, which has a long history in culture. Unfortunately, it seems that the Chinese people's interest in Chinese music is second to Western music. Western music can certainly be studied, but Chinese music is more worthy of study. It cultivates temperament and inspires wisdom. Chinese music is not inferior to Western music. I hope that those who are interested in Chinese music will work hard for it.</p>

<h3>Grand Opening Ceremony of Taijiquan Training Class</h3>
<p>The "Huizhong Fitness Class" organized by our office, temporarily setting up the "Yongnian Taiji Study" group, solemnly held its opening ceremony at 9:00 AM on the first day of the month (previous day) in the auditorium of the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association in Fengyuli, Nantong Road. More than 100 students and guests from all walks of life, including Chen Duomin, Fan Guifu, Zhang Shenzhi, Chen Weiming, Yu Jingde, Huang Hanliang, Zhou Xiangsheng, Li Dexing, Ma Gongyu, and Tang Zuxiang, a total of more than 40 people, gathered together, creating a lively atmosphere. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan reported on the origins of the establishment and the preparatory process, saying: "In this difficult period, the health of the general public is declining. A strong country must first have a strong people. This newspaper has always paid great attention to this issue. This time, thanks to the enthusiastic support of Mr. Chuan Zhongwen, the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association, and social celebrities, this plan can be partially realized. This is the first thing that should be thanked. Since the registration for this group started on the 26th of last month, the number of applicants has exceeded twice the quota in just a few days. I hope you will adhere to the training of [diligence, perseverance, physical shame], work hard and persevere." Then the instructor Chuan Zhongwen and guests delivered speeches. Mr. Chen Weiming said that the effects of Taijiquan are truly incredible. He cited two examples, saying that he had personally seen two people who had contracted lung disease to the second stage. Thanks to the power of Taijiquan, they recovered their health and were able to walk faster than ordinary people. Mr. Tang Zuxiang said that his body was the weakest and most sickly when he was young, but after practicing Taijiquan, his body became stronger day by day. He has not been sick for many years. Taijiquan has similarities with Taoist meditation. Meditation is taking movement in stillness, while Taijiquan is taking stillness in movement, so both have the effect of preventing disease and prolonging life. Mr. Ma Gongyu also said that after learning, he turned from weak to strong, and he can work at his desk all day without feeling tired. All the students were deeply moved. The ceremony ended at about 12:00 PM. Finally, Mr. Chen Weiming demonstrated Baguazhang, Mr. Yang Jie performed Luohan Quan, and Mr. Zhang Qinglin performed Taijiquan. Everyone took a group photo and ate the tea and snacks donated by Guanshengyuan before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Support for Obstetrics</h3>
<p>Mr. Cai Ruoyu wrote in a letter: "I have recently seen your office publishing articles about charitable people donating obstetric aid money. This move to protect human survival is truly the most meaningful, because it not only benefits poor pregnant women, but also has a profound impact on the country and the nation. In response, I am sending 3,000 yuan, which I hope will be included in the obstetric aid fund and actively promoted."</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival Gathering of Seniors</h3>
<p>The Seniors Association held a dinner party at the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association in Nantong Road on the afternoon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, with poetry, music, and moon appreciation to add to the atmosphere. On the spot, Mr. Xue Zuheng donated 10,000 yuan, Shen Xieliying 1,000 yuan, Mrs. Zhu Yan 1,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhu Zhiyao 600 yuan, totaling 12,600 yuan, which was donated to the poverty relief fund of our office and entrusted to be distributed to poor elderly people. We will do so accordingly.</p>
<h3>Weiming Literary and Martial Arts School</h3>
<p>Chen Weiming is proficient in literature, calligraphy, and martial arts. He once served as a compiler in the Qing History Museum and wrote a lot. He founded the Zhirou Boxing Club in Shanghai to promote Taijiquan for 20 years, and thousands of people have followed him. Now he teaches students at home and also publishes his remaining manuscripts. He has set up simple rules and fees. Anyone who has literary requests can contact him at No. 1, Lane 690, Yongjia Road, or the Dazhong Bookstore.</p>
<h3>Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent Appeals for Relief</h3>
<p>The Yangjingbang Sacred Heart Convent, established by the Mumu of the Catholic Salvage Association, has been dedicated to educating children and relieving poverty and disease for more than 70 years. The various schools affiliated with the convent provide free or half-price education to about 4,000 students. The various clinics treated and dispensed medicine to more than 110,000 people last year. In peacetime, they either found ways to earn a living for poor families, or took in their children, providing food and lodging. They provided food and clothing, or a small amount of money, to poor people who came to their door every day. For many years, they have been supported by monthly donations from abroad, and have not publicly solicited donations. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, these donations have stopped, and the convent has no funds to use. Therefore, for dozens of months, the economy has been stretched, and they have felt great difficulty. As the future is long, what can be done? Therefore, they have no choice but to call for help, hoping that all philanthropists will generously donate, the more the better, the less is fine. In this way, orphans and weak women can continue to be maintained, and the virtue can be widely spread, and the merit is immeasurable. If you are willing to donate, please send it directly to the convent at No. 37, Tiantai Road (Old Catholic Church Street), or call 85806, and someone will be sent to pick it up. You can also send it to our office, and we can collect it on your behalf. ○ Opening of Film and Drama School: The Amateur Art Society at No. 1292, Dashanghai Road, offers courses in Peking opera, Western painting, Chinese painting, wood carving, piano, dance, violin, guitar, harmonica, and singing.

<h3>### Thunderstorm (9)</h3>
<p>That night, Takao dreamed of Masato.</p>
<p>In the No. 6 boat sat Masato, Petty Officer Hata, and Takao. Strangely, the No. 6 boat in the submarine school courtyard suddenly started its motor and slid into the water.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Takao unconsciously uttered a sound. Then Masato's eyes, as if about to pop out, said to Takao with great seriousness:</p>
<p>"You, what are you doing on this submarine?"</p>
<p>Masato's voice was so stern that Takao was too frightened to answer. However, soon Masato seemed to sense that there was no way to salvage the situation and said in a very friendly tone:</p>
<p>"Don't interfere with the work. Hide in a corner! It's very dangerous!"</p>
<p>"Just where is this place?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk! You'll know soon."</p>
<p>Masato only answered that much. And tightly closed his mouth, observing some kind of machinery.</p>
<p>Just then, on the sea surface above, sounds like lava from the eruption of Sakurajima rained down. The vibrations shook the hull of the boat violently. Takao looked at his watch.</p>
<p>"It's the sound of Japanese planes. Friendly boats are also starting to move."</p>
<p>Masato muttered to himself, but soon the lava-like falling sounds grew louder again.</p>
<p>"Don't miss the opportunity..."</p>
<p>Masato, biting his lower lip, showed a calm expression like water on his face. Then, after giving some orders to Petty Officer Hata, the submarine kept sinking, and finally stopped moving.</p>
<p>"Masato... what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Takao thought they had missed the opportunity and shouted loudly, but Masato smiled as usual and leisurely began to play chess with the petty officer.</p>
<p>He didn't know how many minutes had passed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he noticed Masato jump up.</p>
<p>"Okay, time's up!"</p>
<p>He and the petty officer disappeared. The sound of the machinery started again, and the submarine tilted towards the sea surface.</p>
<p>Takao felt a great disaster was imminent and spat.</p>
<p>Soon, a violent sound was heard.</p>
<p>"Release!" Masato gave the order. After a second or two of silence. Suddenly, a wave seemed to roll up in the water, and a loud sound occurred. Another shot...</p>
<p>After a short while, Masato's face showed great joy.</p>
<p>"Takao! Be happy! The Allison type hit!"</p>
<p>"Great!"</p>
<p>Takao jumped up and said:</p>
<p>"Wait a minute! Before the military report is complete, the mission is not over."</p>
<p>Masato sat quietly in front of the radio station. (147)</p>
