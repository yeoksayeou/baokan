<h3 id="c1">工作代消閒 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海的工商業因為原料缺乏，動力限制，交通不便等種種關係，已經有逐漸靜止的趨勢。因為工商業的靜止，連帶的使許多人空暇着。這現象在戰時體制下是最不應當的。事業的空開，人們的不工作，是國力的報失，而上海就在無形的損失國力的途徑上，道或許是一時現象，上海政治經濟的調整，必能使上海完全成為一個戰時的都市，好像業邦日本，凡是有利於國家戰力的工商事業，　刃的擴充，生產數量增加到最高的限度，全國能夠工作的國民，個個都有工作做，甚至婦女兒童亦有相當的職務。如能做到這樣，那末上海方才不愧是全國社會的重心，全國政治經濟的模範區。從自由，放任，閒散的社會，轉變成為一個有規律，奮鬥，勤勞的社會，無論在朝在野的上海人士，都要加倍的注意和努力。上海早一天調整，上海早一天成功戰時都會，中國的國力就早一天增加，較爭的勝利也就早一天獲得。國民的開散對於國家方面的損失，必須用國家政治力量去調整。可是國民的閒散對於國民自己本身亦是一種損失，而因為閒散的結果，更能迭成許多不幸的罪惡。近數月來，上海各種事業都呈萎縮現象，可是上海人士宴樂睹博之風氣，與日俱進，娛樂塲所的滿坑滿谷，更是一個極顯著的證明，這種對於精神，金錢，時間的消耗，簡直是人們的慢性自殺行為。上海的大多數人都在自己摧殘自己，上海最後的結果必是消滅，真是毀了自己，毀了社會，毀了國家。享樂的心理原因很多，最普遍的一句話，就是消間。我們不反對娛樂，更不反對消閒，可是，唯一的前提，一要先有工作，二要休養精力的誤樂。工作餘閒才是眞正的閒，休養精力的娛樂之是正當的娛樂，不合乎這個原則的便不是消閒，更不是娛樂。一個良好的國民，必須先有工作，工作之餘，從事娛樂，娛樂的目的在休養精力，預備日後繼續的工作，這是最最簡單的好國民的起碼條件，做全國表率的上海人更要牢記。在社會上沒有工作給你做的時候，難道你自己就不會找自己的工作去做嗎？假如你可以整天打牌，至少你有時間，假如你可以整天吃喝宴樂，至少你有金錢，有時間和金錢的人們，難進不會利用他的時間和金錢去做些有益的工作，而任他無形消耗而自殺嗎？工作不是天上掉下來的，工作是要自己去找的。放眼看，社會上有多少苦難兒童，失學男女，殘廢同胞，有時間和金錢的人們至少可以分一部份時間和金錢來從事這種社會福利工作，現有的福利事業可以幫助他，集合許多同志更可以創辦新事業。假如對於社會事業沒右興趣，你可以想想，往年在百忙之中所要議而不能讀的書有幾多，現在旣然開著，就可把這些要讀的書去讀，假如對於讀書沒有興趣，你更可以想相，你的事業如何停頓，你不妨約集友朋，硏討他的原因，找出在戰時環境下的補救方法，代替的原料怎樣，代替的動力怎樣，這些都是工作，而這些工作都是利人利己的，如果因為這種工作而得到相當的結果，你的愉快一定比賽樂賭博要有　味得多，這是我們主張以工作來消閒的最　的意義。</p>

<p>東京二十二日中央社電日本大本營五月二十二日下午五時發表：五月二十日，敵機動部隊出現于小笠原羣島東方海面上。二十日，二十一日兩日間，空襲南烏島，常地日軍予以邀擊，擊落敵三十二架，地上日軍損書極微。</p>
<p>東京二十二日中央社電于日軍嚴重監視下之馬紹爾方面活動之敵機動部隊，忽出現于小笠原羣島東方海上，二十日，二十一日兩日，對日南鳥島反復加以空襲。二十日之空襲，有敵艦戰機九十四架，九時後，反復來襲五次，但該方面日陸。海軍部隊，業已整備　全之勢，故在敵機出現後，即展開熾烈列之邀整戰，擊落敵機二十三架（內五架示證實）外，似尙有多架中彈，瞬即　下。敵方曾以飛機·潛艇及驅逐艦，搜索或收容此等敵機之駕駛員，日軍對此等敵　船亦加以攻擊。各浮出海面之敵潛艇，一艘曾遭日軍兩次猛攻，砲彈完全命中，該潛艇遂被擊沉。二十一日敵機計三十餘架，自四時半至六時半，來襲兩次，因　於前日之損害，乃作高空攻擊，然又為日軍擊落九架，計兩日之戰鬬，日方損害均極輕　。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日軍報道部闡述　最近河南戰況　洛陽已在大包園中 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京二十二日中央社電日軍報道部，為閘述最近河南戰况，　於昨（二十一）日下午四時，假日本記者俱樂部，接見我國新聞記者，由島田少佐發表戰况如次：洛陽方面為渝方直系軍第一戰區湯恩伯之軍隊，該軍一部駐守於新　黃河沿岸，稱為河防軍。在該方而分為兩道防綫，第一防綫在鄭州·許昌·汜水·新鄭·等地，第二防樣在登封。禹縣。襄城·臨汝·等地，日軍於四月十八日，由中牟及黃河鐵橋　過新舊黃河後，即佔領鄭州等地。其後則分三路進攻洛陽，第一路由黃河鐵橋南端進攻汜水·榮陽·等地，第二路經鄭州西南之密縣。登封，第三路係由許昌經襄城。臨汝。進攻。進攻時，湯恩伯立即調動其在伊陽之幾化部隊，企　增援，但日軍未俠其配備完全，即加以猛繫，使其措手不及，而相繼佔領許昌。變城等地。信陽方面日軍，自五月一日亦同時開始向北猛攻，即於五月九日，在確山前與向南進攻，佔許昌之日軍會師，因此湯恩伯之軍隊，出入困難，指揮系統不能統一，乃四散逃竄往西南地帶。故日軍除一方面以一小部兵力，　淸其殘部外，以一部份兵力直攻洛陽。目下洛陽已在大包國之中，佔領僅為時間問題。而素稱善戰之湯恩伯部隊，不堪我日軍一擊，更非我人意料所及也。</p>

<p>南京二十二日中央社電建設部次畏王家俊，二十二日會見首都中外記者，就此次調整華中航運限制，及增加華鐵票價，暨　內　郵資問無，闡明意旨錄　於后，（甲）計劃確保航運通暢。此次與盟邦海陸軍當局磋商修正航行統制規程，期確保航運圓滑起見，下列各點正計劃實施。　　運輸圓滑，物資供求可以相應。　後當注意綢劑，期壓平物價，消滅墨市。　取締航行上阻礙，如沿途不合法之檢查，抽　　扣船隻，任意勒案等。　　防私　，禁止物資資敵。　確保沿途治安，商請盟邦協助（乙）改訂華中鐵道運費。華中鐵道以開支飛漲收入不敷支出，呈請　整貨運，及客票價目。核其所稱各節，尙屬實情，經轉墨政院核示，奉　後，飭該公司　　實行。（丙）安定郵政經濟。郵政經濟近年來受戰事影響，收人銳减，支出數額龐入，收支不能平衡，僅賴銀行方面透支，為唯一挹注之方。　政經濟崩潰堪虞，為　補救，祗得再將國內外各規郵資，匯兌費等酌加。呈奉政院核准增加百分之二百，自本月十六日起實行。此次所增郵資，較事變前雖增六十倍，衛之一般物品增加率，尙屬低微。此次本部更當切實整飭該局，節省無謂棄費。中樞舉行周會南京二十二日中央社電國府二十二日上午，舉行週會。文官參軍兩處職員全體參加，陳參贊允文主席。行禮如儀，報吿對於時局之觀察，十一時散會。南京二十二日中央社電中央黨部二十二日上午，舉行二○二次紀念周，到六百餘人，戴副秘書長策主席。行禮如議，吳委員凱聲報吿「外交工作概况」，十時餘禮成實際上磨擦反加深</p>
<h3 id="c6">渝共表面妥協　緩和英美抨擊　實際上麿擦反加深 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊關於渝共　擦糾紛，自去歲以來，情形益趨嚴重，最近雙方雖在名義上表示妥協，其實前途暗礁重重，斷難携于。查今次渝共之妥協，實為渝政權假此緩和英美間之攻擊，次則因美副總統華萊士之赴渝。蓋華萊士訪渝之目的，乃在觀測目前渝方之情况，渝政權為掩蔽家醜起見，當對中共假意表示和好。頃據可靠方面消息，爰誌如次：</p>
<p>華萊士之任務　美副總統，將於本月內由美赴渝，當華什華感頓時，曾宴請渝方駐美代表魏道明·施　基·及對渝有關之有力老。查華此行任務，對於渝共磨擦有關，俾抵渝後向各方探詢究竟。吾人觀測此行工作，計　美國對渝之援助，因種種理由遲朱實行，致使渝方深表不滿，因此羅為緩和渝方之焦急，當予敷衍。　蘭於渝美匯兌比率之修正問題。　淪政權以確立民主政治，及强化力量，易言之，華此行任務，不外觀測渝內部實情，及力量如何。渝方獲得華即將來渝之訊，大為焦慮，因　於本身內部弱點頗多，恐予以惡劣影響；故亟於施蔽此項暗　。查最近日軍展開河南作戰，渝軍火敗原因，據淪方發表，實因美對　未予大最援助所致，故曾一再要求美積極接濟。因此筆此行不得不作强　之敷衍。其次為渝美　兌比例，過去以獎金一元折合淪法幣二十元，然置近黑巿　高，相差甚巨，此不但對渝法幣影響至大，而淪方金　亦受甚大打擊。故待華抵渝後，將設法修正。此外最近英美與論抨擊淪方採取獨裁政治，並非民主政治，攻擊輪調，日益熾烈。故我人在客觀立塲觀測，最近渝共妥協，即為應付英美與論之抨擊。</p>
<p>雙方芥蒂業生　關於渝共妥協情形，本月二日，中共代表緩甘寗邊區司令林祖涵，及渝政根代表王世杰，在西安折衝妥協。旬日後，林即在西安首途赴渝，此點已可觀及淪方對中共作最小之讓步。蓋淪方此次在表面上雖為妥協，但在實際上終不願小黨派之存在。易言之，即不願共黨之存在。今　為緩和英美之嚴密注視，及與論之攻擊，似發揮力量之名，出而攏絡各黨各派。查過去渝共之關連，凡當時局發生緊張時，即有表示妥協之情形，故今已證明渝方已臨危急之時。當去年渝方十一中全會開始時，主張以政治解決淪共問題，而共黨之態度，在原則上表示贊成，惟要求實行民主政治，保障不再發生妨碍安全為言。同時渝國民黨更要求共黨履行民國二十六年九月二十二日，所訂之條件四項森：　　行三民主義，　八路軍新四軍　　為中央軍，　取消邊區政府，　取消赤化主義。當初共黨表示已吿實行，但對淪方亦提出要求人則，計：　開放黨禁，承認各黨派合法地位。　承認邊區政府，及國境根據地為其基地。　八路軍新四軍一切後方武奘之接濟。　恢復新四軍番號。　取消綏甘　邊區，及各該根據地之對鎖及包國。　保障民主自由。　保陣人民居住自由，集書自由，結社自由，言論自由·　要求實行地方自治·然渝方措置如何，頗為困難。結果淪共又展開攻擊性之宣傳。渝方謂河南之大敗，共黨毫無協助，不與中央軍合作，責難共黨無愛國心。而共黨之答糧宣傳，則謂渝方將軍力包國邊區共軍，致進日軍擊潰。由此足見渝共之妥協，芥蒂　生，內層磨擦，反為激烈。其前途如何，當不言可喻云。</p>

<p>東京二十二日中央社電　日外務省弘報部長兼情報局第三部代理部長岡崎勝男，二十二日會見紀者團時，曾就敵方盛傳即將開闢之第二戰綫問題，指責其企岡，要旨如次：英。美頻行宣傳即將開關之第二戰綫，毫無黨視之價値，敵人一向認此為得意傑作，敵對第二戰綫之開闢，雖有相當準備，但究將於何日實現，缺乏誠意之美國準備態度，又為一謎。德國偵悉英南部策結兵力五十師，蘇格蘭及其他地域，亦有二十個師兵力以上，但僅以此種兵力仍不能展開西歐上陸作戰。英，美現正傾全力，從事南義戰綫作戰，其攻擊主力置於義大利戰綫，由此觀之，此或為第二戰綫遲遲不能展開之理由。十六日於倫敦召開會議，傳比利時，荷蘭　　各亡命政權，以及英·美·蘇三國聞成立政治協定結果，歐洲反軸心各國勢力範圍大致　已確定。本協定大致如蘇聯主張，英·美將巴爾幹以及北歐全部利權讓渡與蘇聯，至比利時·荷蘭·法·義·則置於英。美勢力範圍之下，任意處分他人土地，於理固極不合，依此，英。美關係則不雖了解。此項協定之成立，可謂為蘇聯强硬督促開闢第二戰　之副產品，今後是否能滿足蘇聯慾望，蘇聯對第二戰綫是否仍將同樣督促，頗値注目。英。美深知雖空戰屢敗亦不至於致命，　若登陸失敗則將致命，吾人觀察所謂西歌登陸戰名實不符，彼等雖誇大宣傳，其實或未有冒險之決心。</p>

<p>有備無患德持鎮靜　據郭培爾博士稱。德方之對策不但準備完成一部份，且已收效，莫斯科雖督促甚切，反軸心方面對大襲侵歐　不決，其故可得而知，蓋戰事一旦發動，即不能隨意中止，謀定後動，反軸心方面實難孟浪從事。德方之武器及其秘密堡壘，為公衆所週知，且控制有利形勢，英美當局一再退縮不敢下此最後一着，良以侵歐為孤注」擲之舉，其延擱日期適足示英美地位之荏弱，恰如郭培爾之言。德人瞻望前途，仍屬充分鎮靜及具滿　希望。</p>

<h3 id="c21">世界史上最大的海三九年前字林西報的論調戰 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>對馬海戰</p>
<p>（字林西報的論調）一九○五年五月卅日時日深晚，從東京接到東鄕大將部下日本海軍在對馬海峽大勝的消息。東鄕大將以前屢被稱為優柔寡斷。報紙上說，東鄕大將大約將在俄國遠東艦隊與波羅的海艦隊會合之前實施各個繫破。但東鄕大將深信俄國艦隊決定從安南出港時，他們必取最短航路向海參　，而默待時機的到來。東鄕大將於是定下了與敵襤隊相過的計劃。俄國艦隊果不出所料，取該航路前進。昨日往中國方面及其他各方而來的報吿，都是可為日本國民慶幸的消息。</p>
<p>駐長畸美國總領事向華盛頓報吿日本海軍擊沈俄戰艦一艘，其地軍艦四艘，並特務艦一艘。據昨日本埠（上海）所得情報，日本艦隊俘　戰艦一艘及巡洋艦一艘。俄國艦隊司令長官羅塞斯脫溫司基大將的戰略，根據俄國式的運命主義，因而當然蒙受若干損失。這是我們第三者盛覺最取深的一點。　　且我們據本社東京特電，知道東鄕大將在周密計劃下，佈　所屬艦隊，嚴陣以待，準備在對馬海峽一舉便俄艦隊不能再起。更據大阪本社特電，東鄉大將實定下了周密的作戰計劃，故俄國艦隊中速力極堅的巡洋艦伊斯姆特號得以逃走，此外祇逃走了小型艦三艘。</p>
<p>日本方面，戰鬥的中心是驅逐艦，損失極少。反之，俄國方面則損失極大。世界史上一切時代的傽大司令官，他也加算在內了。此次對馬海戰，實有關日本的將來。日本使東鄕大將負起了海戰的全部責任，而大將與部下將士的獻自奮鬥，也足以顯示値得全體日本人民信賴的人物。　　日本海海戰（字林西報論調）　　一九○五年五月卅一日—世界史上第十六次的大海戰，在脫拉佛爾伽爾海戰以後一百年的今日，由東洋的納雨遜東鄕大將實行了。該海戰的結果，俄國的全部海軍力，完全被殲。海戰史研究家第一要指出的，脫拉佛爾伽爾海戰與對馬海戰之間，經過了一百年，在這期間，軍　，戰爭方法都起了非常的變化。但這裏有一個共同點，脫拉佛爾伽爾海戰在英國是最重要的海戰，同樣，對馬海戰在日本亦是最重要的海戰。</p>
<p>為最高指揮官者，必具有先見。英國大戰絡家威靈吞氏，在山的逼一而，可以知道山的那面敵人如何行動。同樣，東鄕大將亦斷定敵波羅的海艦隊必取通過對馬海峽而向海參威的最短航路。根擴這推定，派遣上村大將率領一巡洋艦於台灣水域，因此，東鄕大將並不集中全部艦隊在對馬海峽，波羅的海艦隊在進入其最後的墳墓之前，日本海軍决不會完全封鎖到海參威的涌散其　隊。又敦羅的海艦隊司令官相信津輕及宗谷海峽交涉者水雷，並有　逐　防衛，故選擇通過對馬海峽。且東鄉大將亦不在對馬海焚敷設水雷，因自己的艦隊也與敵艦隊一　會　遇危險的。</p>
<p>五月廿六日晨，日本海軍偵察隊的最後一隊，報告波蘭的海艦隊接近對　。翌日晨，見波羅的海艦隊分為二隊行近對馬海峽。右面的一隊是戰艦編成的，左面的一隊是巡洋艦及小艇組成的。艦隊前面有兩艘偵查艇。日本艦隊　遺二艦平安過去，於是該二艦向波羅的海艦隊司令長官報吿說該島沿岸一帶並無準備。</p>
<p>這樣，羅塞斯德溫司基中將希望不與日本海軍接觸而到達海參威。日本艦隊用　艦一艘誘引該中將前進，恰如對馬海峽祇有這一艘兵艦防衛着，開了火門對準俄艦，而在西北方則隱藏者大隊。職　開始於廿七日上午。日本海軍知道利用俄艦隊多隙的編制，是非常有利的。關於戰　的詳細報吿，尙未獲得，我們現在所知的是根據當地特派員的直接電報。我們以前只知道炮彈與魚雷是不能破壞鋼鐵艦的，但俄國艦隊所受的損失則確是受砲彈與魚雷的攻擊所致。戰國結果，波羅的海艦可稱全滅，僅二三艘巡洋艦逃走，司令長幷高級幹部被俘，俘虜三千名以上，俘獲軍艦奧留爾號及尼占拉一世號。</p>
<p>日本海滬戰對計劃在太平洋重建海軍力的俄海軍，贊是悲慘的末路。俄國並欲出動第四艦隊，這也無非重演新的慘劇而已。誠如俄艦隊司令長官所說，他確已用盞了全部力量，但與勇敢，沉者而不自負的東鄉大將，及其指揮下的艦隊對抗，當然非其對手。</p>

<p>第一警察局當局對經濟保安處之現行施策，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>關於創設經濟保安處之旨，業載各報，當局為早日實現起見，曾於本月初旬組織機構，調整人事，務使及早趨向完成使命之途邁進。創設經濟保安處之目的，當為市民所洞悉，簡言之，即實施國民政府所制之戰時特別刑法經濟取締諸條例，及各有關經濟常局所公布之規定，一方面支援上海諸經濟機關，同時取締直接影響市民生活之生活必需物資，尤為第一區公署經濟處現行施策之重點。</p>
<p>此次經濟局第一區公署經濟處之告示，關於火柴，洋燭，肥皂，石炭保有量之登記，及賣買移動之申報，即調查上述該項生活必需品確數量後，再抑制物價之暴漲，以安民生之措置，並非強制收買，當局業已履次聲明，故希望各該物資之所有者及保管者，深明理解當局之意旨，從速勵行登記申報，若有拒絕而不登記或隱瞞數量等情時，雷依囤積治罪條例，及其他法令嚴重處罰。</p>
<p>經濟取締統一執行</p>
<p>又經濟保安處之產生，同時管轄內之經濟取締得能一元化，即過去第一區管內各機關及警察分局，對經濟取締之執行權，一切內經濟保安處担當，而警察官非經濟警察官，對經濟違反，不能執行職權，嗣後其他機關所担當之經濟業務，僅限於行政施策上所必要之調查，此點尚希特別注意。茲將一般警察官與經濟警察之區別，述要如下：</p>
<p>經濟警察任務區別</p>
<p>持有第一警察局長蓋印之經濟警察證明書，執行任務時，須將該證明書提示對方</p>
<p>執行任務時，不論穿着制服與否，應佩帶第一警察局長蓋印並附有號碼之褐色黃底臂章。</p>
<p>富執行任務時，須有二人以上之組合，嚴禁單獨勤務。</p>
<p>關於經濟保安處之處之運用與各機關取得密切合作，連繫實施切實有效之取締。希民衆以正確之認識，密切的協助，當局之意旨，對經濟警察官席正行為，當予以嚴正處斷，市民如發現警察官舞弊時，即希將日期地點警察官姓名號碼記下，向第一警察局長或齋察處長等處告發。</p>

<p>顔惠慶詞顔駿人博士簡述陳氏生平謂：鄙人菸民國元年在天津與陳先生初次見面，斯時先生首次返國，以華僑效勞祖國，抱負至堪欽佩，數十年來與先生同在外交界服務，對先生生平有數點，極為敬仰：　為愛國心。先生為千里達之華僑，受外國敎育，一旦聞悉民國成立，即棄其舒適之外國生活，萬里遄返，為祖國效勞，此完全為愛國心之表現。　為學識高超。先生一生致力學問，未嘗稍懈，先生以英文所寫之文章，雖英美之有名人物，亦有不及，文章無絲毫虛為氣，全為精心結撰出於眞誠，護者無論與先生之見解是否相同，但為之感動則一。　為抱負遠大。先生是政治家而非政客，先在懷具抱負而返祖國服務，生平服　孫總理對民權主張，尤為贊成，對外以期使中國在國際問平等，對內希望中國能成為眞正共和國家。先生雖曾為官，但認為做官是達到實現抱負的一種手段，與政客以做官為目的者截然不同，抱負不伸，先生即棄官不仕，光明森落，殊堪欽仰。綜觀先生之生平，與孫總理有極相似之處，先生在目前之環境中逝世，壯志未伸，在先生當不無遺憾，其遺言中主要者吾人想像常為總理臨終時所說兩句話，即「革命尙未成功，同志仍須努力」。</p>

<p>其一</p>
<p>生活難難，壽情呌叫苦，家有子女若令失學，於心何忍！然而學雜等費之負擔，實是一個嚴重的壓迫，日來更有學校徽收補助金之舉，據南光中小學通告，係根據教育會核准，但按其辦法，初則曰自即日起至學期終了前止；綱則又日自五月份起至七月份止，數目自一百至三百兀，並開須一次收足三個月云云。</p>
<p>查本學期終了為六月底，七月一日起着假，既云學期終了前止，「前」字「止」字作何解釋，豈着假期中為須由家長補助乎！嗚呼，堂堂學校有此矛盾之舉，是否投機取巧，實不得而知矣！家長家長，啼笑皆非也—（一個貧苦的家長）</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>今天晚上，接到孩子帶回了一張校方通知書，好像說：奉當局訓令，飭自即日起，向各家長徽收補助費三百元。在生活高漲下教師的生活固然淸苦，難道學生的家長個個都有錢嗎？甚望當局訓令各校要有錢的家長出補助費，無力者免付，這樣，使淸塞的我們少負擔一點，校方亦不會強迫的收費了。（陳炳文）</p>

<p>在民國三十年的春天吧？上海難民救濟會宣吿解散，當時袁禮敦黃雨齊兩先生，目睹一般無家可歸的難意，徬徨街頭，勢必形成乞丐，殊屬可憫，乃毅然創辦上海貧兒工藝院於法華鎭，奠定本院之基石。至卅一年，由張連舫先生繼續維持，大國擴充，並將該院遷至極司斐而路九十九號，慘　經營，不遺餘力。可是生活程度的高漲，漫無止境，三百多個難童的生活費，這一筆鉅額開支，終於成了問題。遣散吧，這一羣迷途的羔羊，怎麼能忍心地讓他去流浪？那時（卅一年冬）該院董事們就請陳福康先生出來接辦，憑着陳先生的滿腔熱忱，奔走呼號，才把該院　到南市中華路一三一八號（現在的院址），又在文廟路開闢了第二院，總算不負社會人仕的企望。</p>
<p>教養兼施</p>
<p>該院於　到兒童衣食之外，同時又一辦了一所半日制的完全小學，又開闢了三個工塲（縫級部綱袋部毛巾部），和臨時設計的一種小型手工業等，使他們有求學和習裏的機會，養成自力更生的精神。在將來脫離該院時，都能立足於社會，至於該院的音樂隊，早為社會會仕稱許，在倪喪和大規模的集會中，都有他們的蹤跡。院中的衛生設施，除聘有院　外，並設置醫藥室○病房，除輕症自行診斷外，其餘較重之病症，由院方送至永川醫院及南市平民醫院診治。</p>
<p>經費支絀</p>
<p>經費方面，除由陳院長竭力籌措外，大半是靠情院生的工藝生產，如織織毛由編網袋縫衣等，其他又靠着南市各俱樂部的捐助，現在呢，工塲的生產為了原料中斷，不能開工，各俱樂部相繼實告停業，因此最近該院的經費，是感到十分困難。為表示公開起見，自五月一日起歡迎參觀，同時希望各界善士，予以物質上的捐助，使該院二百餘貧兒仍能繼續學藝，其德寶無涯量。</p>

<p>在途中，會有一個斜披。野草穗在被海風搖擺着。不久後，而前現出一片注洋的藍色海來。這一天，是秋天的一個天高氣爽的風景。然而，他都無心去觀賞。</p>
<p>（是的。我並沒有忘記。並未從忘記。）</p>

<p>「到頭了，請下車吧！」</p>

<p>面前就是無人烟而寂靜的海水浴休息所。寫着「海之家」的白在條，破了一半，而在着軍簾子團繞着，掛着。海，就在前面，像貼着一張監色紙一樣，非常的靜。</p>
<p>與其稅是靜，勿寗說是模糊，他對於海岸的感覺就是如此。沿岸的街道上，沒有一個人在行走。隆夫像不知所之一樣，皙時佇立着眺望海濱</p>

<p>他好容易找到了幾個在海邊遊玩的兒意，便這樣問。</p>
<p>「不是在那邊麼？」</p>
<p>夏天雖然過去，而仍然穿着一條短褲的兒童，認為問的話是多餘，因為那是該自己知道的，所以囘答的腔調，倒不大舒服。議天順着指的方向一看，是一條縱的街道。</p>
<p>好像業已失掉了靜養的希望一樣，他無精打彩地走向那條道路。在十字路口的第三個門上，便發見了久里濱館的招牌。雖然是兩層樓的建築，然而是非當簡陋的房十。稅牠是旅館，眞有點冤枉，實際上卻很像一個小飯舖。雖然這樣說了一句，然而費了半天工夫，方從廚房裹走出來一位女人。像漁夫老婆一樣的老板娘，覺着非常奇特的樣子，凝視着隆夫，當一讃同事寫的介紹僧時，才和議地說：「請進來吧！這兒只有夏天的屋子，好在是休息一下，或許</p>
<p>這樣說着，就領到二樓去了。二層樓上的　子，都把間隔傘下去了，成為一個滿目荒凉的空</p>
<p>「夏天會租給東京的小學生們，一直到現在還有收拾。請你選擇一間喜歡的屋子吧！馬上</p>
<p>老板娘獨自說着話，便跑下樓去了。</p>
<p>隆夫傷疲倦了的旅客一樣，在褪色的　子上，不管三七二十一堆躺下了。從窗戶裏看不見海，只是像海一樣的色，表現着廣闊的天空。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Work as Leisure <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors are gradually stagnating due to various factors such as raw material shortages, power limitations, and inconvenient transportation. This stagnation is causing many people to be idle, a phenomenon that should not occur under a wartime system. The suspension of business and people not working represent a loss of national strength. Shanghai is unknowingly losing national strength in this way, although it may only be a temporary phenomenon. The political and economic adjustments in Shanghai will surely transform it into a complete wartime city, like wartime Japan. All industrial and commercial endeavors that benefit national war efforts are expanded to the fullest extent, production quantities are increased to the highest limits, and every citizen capable of working has a job. Even women and children have appropriate duties. If this can be achieved, then Shanghai will truly be worthy of being the center of gravity of the nation's society and a model area for the nation's politics and economy. Transforming from a free, permissive, and leisurely society into a disciplined, striving, and industrious one requires the redoubled attention and effort of Shanghai residents, both in and out of government. The sooner Shanghai adjusts, the sooner Shanghai becomes a successful wartime metropolis, the sooner China's national strength will increase, and the sooner victory in the war will be achieved. The loss to the nation due to the people's idleness must be addressed using national political power. However, the people's idleness is also a loss to the people themselves, and the result of idleness can lead to many unfortunate evils. In recent months, various industries in Shanghai have shown signs of decline, yet the atmosphere of feasting and gambling among Shanghai residents is increasing daily. The packed entertainment venues are a clear demonstration of this. Such consumption of spirit, money, and time is simply a form of slow suicide for the people. The majority of Shanghai residents are destroying themselves, and the ultimate result for Shanghai will be annihilation, truly ruining oneself, ruining society, and ruining the nation. There are many reasons for the psychology of enjoyment, the most common being "passing the time." We do not oppose entertainment, and even more so, we do not oppose leisure. However, the only prerequisite is that there must first be work, and secondly, entertainment to restore energy. Leisure after work is true leisure, and entertainment to restore energy is legitimate entertainment. Anything that does not meet these principles is neither leisure nor entertainment. A good citizen must first have work. After work, one engages in entertainment. The purpose of entertainment is to restore energy in preparation for continued work in the future. These are the most basic conditions for being a good citizen, and Shanghai residents, who serve as a national example, should remember them well. When there is no work for you to do in society, wouldn't you find your own work to do? If you can play mahjong all day, at least you have the time. If you can eat, drink, and feast all day, at least you have the money. Won't people with time and money use their time and money to do some beneficial work, instead of letting it be consumed invisibly in self-destruction? Work doesn't fall from the sky; work must be found. Look around. How many suffering children, out-of-school boys and girls, and disabled compatriots are there in society? People with time and money can at least dedicate a portion of their time and money to engage in this kind of social welfare work. Existing welfare organizations can help, and new endeavors can be established by gathering many like-minded people. If you're not interested in social work, you can think about how many books you wanted to read in the past but couldn't because you were too busy. Now that you're idle, you can read those books. If you're not interested in reading, you can think about how your business has stagnated. You might as well gather friends and discuss the reasons for this, and find ways to remedy it in the wartime environment. What are the alternative raw materials? What are the alternative power sources? These are all work, and this work is beneficial to both yourself and others. If you achieve significant results through this kind of work, your joy will certainly be much more flavorful than gambling and entertainment. This is the most profound meaning of our advocacy for using work as leisure.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on May 22nd: On May 20th, an enemy mobile unit appeared in the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands. Over the two days of the 20th and 21st, it launched an air raid on Minami Iwo Jima. The garrisoned Japanese forces intercepted the enemy, shooting down thirty-two enemy aircraft. The losses of ground Japanese forces were minimal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – An enemy mobile unit, under severe surveillance by Japanese forces, which was conducting operations in the Marshall Islands area, suddenly appeared in the sea east of the Ogasawara Islands. Over the two days of the 20th and 21st, it repeatedly launched air raids on Japanese Minami Tori Shima. The air raid on the 20th involved ninety-four enemy carrier-based fighters. After 9:00 AM, they launched repeated attacks five times. However, the Japanese land and naval forces in the area were fully prepared. Therefore, as soon as the enemy aircraft appeared, they launched a fierce interception battle, shooting down twenty-three enemy aircraft (five of which were unconfirmed). In addition, many other aircraft appeared to have been hit and crashed immediately. The enemy used aircraft, submarines, and destroyers to search for or rescue the pilots of these enemy aircraft. Japanese forces also attacked these enemy vessels. One enemy submarine that surfaced was subjected to two fierce attacks by Japanese forces, and the shells hit directly. The submarine was sunk. On the 21st, approximately thirty enemy aircraft attacked twice from 4:30 AM to 6:30 AM. Due to the damage inflicted on the previous day, they launched high-altitude attacks. However, nine more aircraft were shot down by Japanese forces. The Japanese side sustained very light losses in the two days of combat.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Military Reporting Department Elaborates on Recent Henan Battle Situation: Luoyang Already Encircled <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese military reporting department, in order to elaborate on the recent Henan battle situation, met with Chinese news reporters at the Japanese Press Club yesterday (21st) at 4:00 PM. Major Shimada announced the battle situation as follows: The Luoyang area is defended by the troops of Tang Enbo's First War Area, which is directly under the Chongqing government. A portion of these troops are stationed along the Xin-Old Yellow River, known as the River Defense Army. In that area, there are two lines of defense. The first line of defense is in Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Sishui, Xinzheng, and other places. The second line of defense is in Dengfeng, Yuxian, Xiangcheng, Linru, and other places. On April 18th, Japanese forces, after crossing the Xin-Old Yellow River from Zhongmou and the Yellow River Railway Bridge, occupied Zhengzhou and other places. Afterwards, they advanced on Luoyang in three routes. The first route advanced from the south end of the Yellow River Railway Bridge, attacking Sishui, Rongyang, and other places. The second route passed through Mixian and Dengfeng, southwest of Zhengzhou. The third route advanced from Xuchang through Xiangcheng and Linru. During the advance, Tang Enbo immediately mobilized several of his units in Yiyang, attempting to reinforce Luoyang. However, Japanese forces, before his preparations were complete, launched a fierce attack, catching him off guard and successively occupying Xuchang and other cities. The Japanese forces in the Xinyang area also simultaneously began a fierce northward attack on May 1st. On May 9th, they joined forces with the Japanese forces that had occupied Xuchang, attacking southward in Queshan. As a result, Tang Enbo's troops faced difficulties in maneuvering, and the command system could not be unified. They scattered and fled to the southwest area. Therefore, the Japanese forces, in addition to using a small force to clear out the remnants, used a portion of their forces to directly attack Luoyang. Currently, Luoyang is already encircled. Its capture is only a matter of time. The troops of Tang Enbo, known for their combat prowess, were unable to withstand a single blow from our Japanese forces, which was beyond our expectations.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Vice Minister Wang of the Ministry of Construction Meets with Chinese and Foreign Reporters, Explains Adjustments to Shipping and Other Matters <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Wang Jiajun, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Construction, met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital on the 22nd to explain the intentions behind the recent adjustments to shipping restrictions in Central China, increases in railway fares, and increases in domestic postal rates. A record of the explanations is as follows: (A) Plans to Ensure Smooth Shipping: In order to ensure smooth shipping, the following points are being planned and implemented after discussions with the Allied maritime and military authorities regarding revisions to the shipping control regulations. Transportation will be smoother, and the supply and demand of materials can be matched accordingly. Attention will be paid to textiles to flatten prices and eliminate the black market. Obstacles to shipping will be eliminated, such as illegal inspections along the way, detention of ships, and arbitrary extortion. Smuggling will be prevented, and the supply of materials to the enemy will be prohibited. Security along the way will be ensured, with assistance requested from the Allies. (B) Revision of Central China Railway Freight Rates: The Central China Railway has reported that its expenditures have soared and revenues are insufficient to cover expenses. It has requested adjustments to freight and passenger ticket prices. Upon verifying the claims, it was determined that they were factual. After forwarding the request to the Executive Yuan for review and receiving approval, the company was instructed to implement the adjustments. (C) Stabilizing Postal Finances: The postal finances have been affected by the war in recent years, with revenues sharply declining and expenditures rising sharply. Revenue and expenditure are unbalanced, and the only way to supplement the shortfall is through bank overdrafts. The collapse of postal finances is a cause for concern. In order to remedy this situation, it is necessary to increase domestic and foreign postal rates and exchange fees. The Executive Yuan approved an increase of 200%, which will be implemented from the 16th of this month. Although the current postal rate increase is sixty times higher than before the incident, it is still low compared to the general increase rate of commodities. The Ministry will also thoroughly rectify the postal bureau to save on unnecessary expenses. Central Government Holds Weekly Meeting.

<h3 id="e6">Chongqing and the Communists Reach Superficial Compromise to Ease British and American Criticism, But Friction Is Actually Intensifying <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Regarding the Chongqing and Communist friction and disputes, the situation has become increasingly serious since last year. Although both sides have nominally expressed compromise recently, the future is fraught with hidden reefs, making cooperation difficult. This Chongqing-Communist compromise is actually a move by the Chongqing government to ease attacks from Britain and America. Secondly, it is due to Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing. Wallace's purpose in visiting Chongqing is to observe the current situation in Chongqing. In order to cover up domestic scandals, the Chongqing government is feigning goodwill towards the Communists. According to reliable sources, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wallace's Mission: The US Vice President will travel to Chongqing from the US this month. When Wallace was in Washington, he hosted a banquet for Wei Daoming, Shi Zhiji, and other influential figures related to Chongqing who were stationed in the US. Wallace's mission is related to the friction between Chongqing and the Communists, so that he can inquire about the details from all parties after arriving in Chongqing. Our observation of this mission includes: US aid to Chongqing has been delayed for various reasons, causing Chongqing to express deep dissatisfaction. Therefore, in order to ease Chongqing's anxiety, he will give perfunctory answers. The issue of revising the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Chongqing legal tender. The Chongqing government wants to establish a democratic political system and strengthen its power. In other words, Wallace's mission is nothing more than to observe the internal situation and strength of Chongqing. The Chongqing side was greatly worried when it received the news that Wallace was about to visit, because it was aware of its own internal weaknesses and feared that it would have a negative impact. Therefore, it was anxious to cover up this secret. According to the Chongqing side, the reason for the Chongqing army's defeat in the recent Japanese military operation in Henan was that the US did not provide the greatest assistance. Therefore, it has repeatedly requested the US to actively provide assistance. As a result, this trip had to offer strong perfunctory answers. The second is the US-Chongqing exchange rate. In the past, one US dollar was converted to twenty Chongqing legal tender, but the black market exchange rate is much higher, which has a great impact on the Chongqing legal tender and a great blow to the Chongqing financial system. Therefore, after Wallace arrives in Chongqing, he will find a way to revise the exchange rate. In addition, British and American public opinion has recently criticized the Chongqing side for adopting a dictatorship instead of a democratic political system, and the attacks are becoming increasingly fierce. Therefore, from an objective standpoint, the recent Chongqing-Communist compromise is to respond to attacks from British and American public opinion.</p>
<p>Differences Have Already Arisen: Regarding the Chongqing-Communist compromise, on the 2nd of this month, Communist representative Lin Zuhan, commander of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and Chongqing government representative Wang Shijie reached a compromise in Xi'an. Ten days later, Lin immediately left Xi'an for Chongqing, which shows that the Chongqing side has made the smallest concessions to the Communists. The Chongqing side is nominally compromising this time, but in reality, it is unwilling to allow the existence of small parties, that is, it is unwilling to allow the existence of the Communist Party. Now, in order to ease the close attention and attacks of Britain and the United States, it seems to be using its power to win over all parties and factions. In the past, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists has shown signs of compromise whenever the situation became tense. Therefore, it has now been proven that Chongqing is in a time of crisis. When the Chongqing 11th Plenary Session began last year, it advocated resolving the Chongqing-Communist issue politically. The Communist Party's attitude was to agree in principle, but it demanded the implementation of a democratic political system to ensure that safety was no longer hindered. At the same time, the Chongqing Kuomintang demanded that the Communist Party fulfill the four conditions stipulated on September 22, 1937: Implement the Three People's Principles. Reorganize the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army into the Central Army. Abolish the border region government. Abandon the red ideology. The Communist Party initially stated that it had been implemented, but it also made demands on the Chongqing side, including: Open up party bans and recognize the legal status of all parties. Recognize the border region government and the national border base as its base. Provide logistical support for all rear areas of the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Restore the designations of the New Fourth Army. Abolish the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, and the blockade and encirclement of various bases. Guarantee democratic freedoms. Guarantee people's freedom of residence, freedom of assembly, freedom of association, and freedom of speech. Demand the implementation of local autonomy. However, it was quite difficult for the Chongqing side to take action. As a result, Chongqing and the Communists launched offensive propaganda again. The Chongqing side said that the Communist Party did not provide any assistance in the great defeat in Henan and did not cooperate with the Central Army, accusing the Communist Party of lacking patriotism. The Communist Party's response was that the Chongqing side surrounded the Communist army in the border region with its military force, causing the Japanese army to defeat them. This shows that differences have arisen in the Chongqing-Communist compromise, and internal friction is intensifying. Its future is self-evident.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Chen Jicheng, our ambassador to Manchukuo, returned to his post on the 21st. He stated: After returning to the country in mid-March and arriving in Beijing, I reported to the central government and participated in the National Government's fourth anniversary celebration.

Increasing production is the National Government's top priority. Therefore, since January this year, the National Government has successively held national economic conferences and agricultural production increase conferences in various provinces and cities across the country. Officials and civilians are working together to increase production in order to cooperate in the war and complete the great cause of invigorating China and protecting Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Post-War Southern Transportation Will Still Focus on Maritime Transport: Mr. Yuuzaki Toshio Expresses His Views <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Mr. Yuuzaki Toshio, an authority in the Japanese shipping industry, met with reporters from our agency on the 22nd and asserted that future transportation between Japan and the South will still focus on maritime transport. The main points are as follows: After the war, railways and aviation will also be quite important for transportation to the South, but the main mode of transport will still be maritime transport. Large ships are not particularly necessary. What is necessary are medium-sized ships that connect Southeast Asia with Central China, North China, and Korea, and small ships that connect various parts of Southeast Asia with South China. Therefore, Japanese industry must also develop towards western Japan and various parts of Southeast Asia. It is necessary to industrialize the southern cities of Kyushu, to industrialize the entire of Taiwan, and to industrialize major cities in Southeast Asia such as Singapore and Java. After industrializing various parts of Southeast Asia, ship will be able to save, Japanese should first develop light industry in Southeast Asia, gradually progressing to heavy industry. At the same time, maritime transport will be extremely developed. Japan should use 80% of its maritime transport capacity to engage in maritime transport in East Asia. The Europe-Asia route and the Asia-America route, the round-the-world route, will also exist. Ships on those routes should only account for 20% of the ships on the Greater East Asia route. In short, after the war, Japan should have 20 million tons of ship. In principle, should be the responsibility of shipping companies to operate. In addition to expanding the number of ships, each company can also operate large maritime aircraft.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Heavy Showers Frequent on the Indian Frontline, Fierce Fighting on the Central and Northern Routes: Japanese Forces Launch Fierce Attacks to Crush Enemy Attempts to Lift Siege <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Heavy showers are frequent on the Indian Frontline as the rainy season approaches. Japanese forces are launching fierce attacks daily with Imphal as their target. Enemy forces on the Imphal front believe that the Japanese supply volume will decrease during the rainy season, and their striking power will also weaken. They have launched fierce attacks towards Kohima with a strong mechanized unit as the backbone, attempting to break through the Kohima-Imphal road and lift the heavy siege on the Imphal Plain. Conversely, the Japanese forces moving north are fiercely attacking the enemy forces on the Palel front, achieving significant results. The enemy's Fourth Army is also doing its utmost to defend that area. Tanks and armored vehicles are being sent south from Imphal in succession. The Japanese forces are intercepting them at a certain location, engaging in fierce tank battles on the banks of the Iril River. The battle is currently raging. A summary of the battle situation in that area is as follows: In the Kohima area, the Japanese forces are gathering forces from the Dimapur area to counter the enemy's stubborn counterattacks, engaging in fierce battles in the Narhema-Zubza area. The Japanese are also cooperating, continuously bombing enemy artillery positions in that area, and are still attacking the choke point of the Kohima-Imphal road. Enemy paratroopers have landed in northern Burma, attempting to maintain areas behind the Japanese forces. They are currently surrounded by Japanese forces. The enemy forces have constructed fortifications in the Mawlu area, resisting stubbornly. Since the 8th, they have been unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese forces and have abandoned the Mawlu fortifications, retreating towards the eastern shore of Lake Indawgyi. In the Nujiang area, the Yunnan Army, advancing towards the eastern shore of the Nujiang, has crossed the Nujiang in several places since the 11th, attacking towards Tengyue. The Japanese forces in the Nujiang area are intercepting them, inflicting heavy losses. The Japanese forces engaged the 115th Regiment of the Yunnan New 39th Division 23 kilometers east of Tengyue, repelling them and achieving great results. Because enemy air forces are still mainly carrying out harassment operations around Dimapur and Imphal, preventing the advance of the Japanese forces, and recently, enemy air forces in the northern general area have also been unusually active, providing material assistance to the Yunnan Army in the Nujiang area. In response, the Japanese air force is cooperating, attacking ground units in Imphal, bombing enemy paratrooper flight bases and their air force bases, destroying the Sazub enemy airfield and other important facilities, and severely damaging enemy gliders, transport planes, and ammunition depots on the ground. Therefore, the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been crushed. Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – After the enemy army's retreat route from Ukhrul was cut off, it continued to retreat towards Imphal. On the morning of the 16th, it gathered a force of approximately 1,000 men, under the cover of more than a dozen tanks, and launched a fierce counterattack near Hill 3913, four kilometers east of Sengmai, and Hill 5417 in Meitrakhong and Chittakong, behind the Japanese fortifications, along the Ukhrul River. The counterattack was repelled by the Japanese army. The enemy army is trying its best to seize the retreat route from Ukhrul, and counterattacks in that area will become increasingly fierce in the future. However, the elite Japanese forces are firmly defending and are fully prepared.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Burma Strengthens Anti-Espionage Measures <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The continuous advances of the Japanese-Indian allied forces have caused the British and American forces defending India to feel extremely anxious. Paratroopers have been dropped into Burmese territory to conduct propaganda activities, claiming that wells and reservoirs have been poisoned, threatening residents, and causing Burmese people to be terrified. In order to counter such schemes by the British and Americans, the Burmese government has decided to strengthen anti-espionage measures. Recently, Bhamo, in the name of the Director of the National Service Bureau, issued a circular to local district and county administrative bureaus, stipulating that members of the National Service Corps in each area will be the center of the people's anti-espionage teams, and must maintain close contact with the police station and the Japanese and Indian armies, taking the lead in assuming the important responsibility of defending the country. Bhamo also said that the government has ordered National Service Corps members in various areas to make efforts to arrest spies who have infiltrated the country to engage in activities, and at the same time ordered each Corps member to do their best to defend and eliminate elements that threaten the people. Desperate after defeat, the enemy sent spies to infiltrate the country, carrying out despicable acts such as spreading in wells and reservoirs. The people of Burma absolutely cannot tolerate such inhumane measures.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Mr. Oka, Chief of Information, Discusses the Second Front <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, Director of the Public Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry and Acting Director of the Third Department of the Information Bureau, met with a group of reporters on the 22nd. He addressed the issue of the so-called "second front" that the enemy is rumored to be preparing to open, criticizing their scheme. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>England and America frequently publicize the imminent opening of a second front, but this has no value whatsoever. The enemy has always considered this to be a masterful stroke. Although the enemy has made considerable preparations for opening a second front, the date of its realization remains unclear. America's insincere attitude of preparation is also a mystery. German intelligence indicates that England has concentrated fifty divisions of troops in southern England, and there are more than twenty divisions in Scotland and other areas, but this force alone is insufficient to launch a landing operation in Western Europe. England and America are currently focusing all their efforts on the Southern Italy front, with their main attack force positioned on the Italian line. This may be the reason why the second front has been delayed.</p>
<p>A meeting was held in London on the 16th, rumored to have resulted in the establishment of a political agreement between Belgium, the Netherlands, and other governments-in-exile, as well as England, America, and the Soviet Union. The spheres of influence of the anti-Axis countries in Europe have been largely determined. This agreement largely follows the Soviet Union's proposals, with England and America ceding all rights and interests in the Balkans and Northern Europe to the Soviet Union. Belgium, the Netherlands, France, and Italy are placed under the sphere of influence of England and America, who can dispose of others' territories at will, which is inherently unreasonable. Based on this, the relationship between England and America is easily understood.</p>
<p>The establishment of this agreement can be seen as a byproduct of the Soviet Union's forceful urging to open a second front. Whether it can satisfy the Soviet Union's desires in the future, and whether the Soviet Union will continue to urge for a second front in the same way, deserves close attention. England and America know that even repeated defeats in air combat are not fatal, but a failed landing would be. We observe that the so-called Western European landing operation does not match its name in reality. Although they exaggerate their propaganda, they may not have the determination to take the risk.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a London dispatch: South African Prime Minister Smuts delivered a speech on the current war situation at a ceremony for freemen in Birmingham on the 19th, stating:</p>
<p>The attack on Hitler's European fortress will be carried out by the Soviet army from the east, and by the British and American armies from the south, that is, from the Mediterranean and Atlantic fronts, as well as the west, launching a three-pronged attack. The Western offensive is also considered the second front, but it is actually the third front. This war is the largest offensive in history. A major continental operation will soon be launched. This continental war has been long awaited, and its scale will be enormous and of utmost importance.</p>
<p>England and America Stake Everything</p>
<p>Bern, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The Swiss German News newspaper comments that as the world eagerly awaits the anti-Axis powers to launch an invasion of Europe, Dr. Goebbels once said that the anti-Axis powers hope that the German army will shorten its lines, just as in November 1918, followed by a military collapse, and then a domestic political collapse. Now the anti-Axis powers must also admit that Germany's political and economic power has not been shaken at all. The Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences failed to find a way for the anti-Axis powers to respond to the current situation. They were forced to decide to invade Europe, hoping to stake everything on one throw, but the enemy will undoubtedly suffer great losses, such as in Dunkirk and the Dnieper River campaigns.</p>
<p>Vast Manpower and Material Resources Required</p>
<p>The London Daily Worker newspaper claims that the relatively small-scale landing operation in North Africa required two million tons of shipping space, or 550 ships each of 4,000 tons. If a large-scale invasion of Europe is to be launched with one million men or sixty divisions, the shipping space required would be at least three times that of North Africa. According to American military expert Major Eliot, about eighty divisions of troops are needed to have any hope of success in Europe. Even more unacceptably, this shipping space is not only needed temporarily, but must be constantly increased to supply military needs. According to an American official from the Second Front Chief of Staff, the preparations for the second front and its first phase will be largely carried out by the British and American air forces. In other words, in the weeks before the battle, the future landing sites and defense fortifications will be constantly bombed. According to British assessments, the current air raids are a prelude to the invasion of Europe.</p>
<p>Prepared and Calm: Germany Remains Calm</p>
<p>According to Dr. Goebbels, the German response is not only partially prepared but has already taken effect. Although Moscow is urging them intensely, the anti-Axis powers are hesitant about launching a large-scale invasion of Europe. The reason for this is understandable because once a war starts, it cannot be easily stopped. The anti-Axis powers are struggling to act rashly. German weapons and secret fortifications are well known to the public, and Germany controls a favorable situation. British and American authorities have repeatedly retreated, unwilling to take this final step, because the invasion of Europe is a desperate gamble. The delay only demonstrates the weakness of the British and American position, as Dr. Goebbels said. The Germans look forward with full calmness and hope.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: The anti-Axis forces on the Southern Italian front halted their operations again on Saturday and Sunday morning, probably due to the heavy losses suffered in recent days, requiring time to reorganize their troops. After half a day, General Alexander's troops began another large-scale offensive with infantry and tank forces, focusing on three areas: near Fondi along the coastal highway, near Pico and Pontecorvo, and near Peidimonte. The American forces are having difficulty advancing in the coastal area because the German army laid many mines when they withdrew from Itri and Gaeta. The fighting was most intense near Pico and Pontecorvo, with both armies advancing and retreating last week. The positions gained by the enemy were mostly recaptured by German counterattacks. Fierce street fighting broke out in the city of Peidimonte, especially in the southeast, and the German army finally drove the enemy out of the city.</p>
<p>American General Nearly Meets an Untimely End</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – Huitong News Agency reports: Anti-Axis newspapers carry news from Italy: General Clark, commander of the American Fifth Army, was inspecting the front line yesterday morning and nearly fell into a German trap, narrowly escaping with his life. A German flat-trajectory gun with concealed high explosives was detonated as General Clark's car passed, nearly killing him. Many American soldiers were injured, one seriously.</p>

<p>Reverence for the Imperial Decree</p>
<p>Diligently striving in accordance with the Imperial Decree, possessing abundant strength to seize opportunities, and forever fulfilling the great mission of the nation.</p>
<p>Enjoying the Path of Divine Protection</p>
<p>The existence of divine protection is certain, but it cannot be obtained carelessly.</p>
<p>Divine protection is a reflection of utmost sincerity. Therefore, one should reflect, and unrealized achievements are due to insufficient sincerity. By further cultivating sincerity, "Heaven will surely be with justice, and the gods will surely be moved by sincerity." This is the reason.</p>
<p>Honesty is the Final Victory, Believe It</p>
<p>Although this is true for everyone, young people who are about to stand up for the nation must especially believe it. Even if others mock you for being foolish and laugh at you for being stupid, the final victory will surely belong to the honest. This is because honesty is the natural order of things.</p>
<p>Filial Piety is the Foundation of All Virtues</p>
<p>Filial piety is the foundation of all virtues, and no matter how times change, this is an unchanging truth. Filial piety originates from the most sincere feelings of love and remembrance for one's parents. Therefore, without filial piety, loyalty, integrity, and trustworthiness cannot originate from sincere intentions. Inevitably, everything will lack authenticity, and even if one gains temporary luck, one will eventually fail. When we observe people, we often consider their way of treating their parents as the best indicator.</p>
<p>Dignity is a Natural Manifestation of Personality</p>
<p>True dignity emanates from personality. With the cultivation of character, dignity will naturally arise. Therefore, affectation is not the right way. It must be remembered that dignity cannot be created through pretense; it is naturally felt by others.</p>
<p>Merely Playing with Small Talents Will Lead to Misfortune</p>
<p>Sloth can also be called the disease of the talented. Those who are considered talented often think that they can accomplish things at any time, so why rush? Consequently, they become lazy in everything. However, time waits for no one, and things progress rapidly. In their arrogance, they unconsciously become outcasts of the world. By the time they realize this, they are no longer worthy of respect. Therefore, the primary principle for us to conduct ourselves in the world is to not rely on cleverness, but to handle affairs earnestly.</p>
<p>(Note: The term "talented" here refers to people with intelligence and ability.)</p>
<p>Do Not Confuse Bravery with Recklessness</p>
<p>Nothing is worse than the likes of an ignorant person.</p>
<p>Do Not Abandon Righteousness Because of Personal Feelings</p>
<p>The way to conduct oneself in the world lies in upholding righteousness and fulfilling one's duties. This is simple, but also extremely difficult and most important. If everyone practices it, there will be no mistakes.</p>
<p>Know Evil and Not Tolerate It.</p>
<p>To condone evil, or to intentionally distort the good because of the person involved, is not an attitude we should have. The world often sees people harboring resentment and jealousy, which is undesirable. To slander as evil what one has always disliked, even if it is good; or to not condemn as evil what one often pleases, even if it is evil, are both wrong. Even if one does not like a person, one must praise them if they act righteously, otherwise it is wrong.</p>
<p>Do Not Take Profit as Profit; Take Righteousness as Profit</p>
<p>There is a saying that one should take righteousness as profit. If one takes righteousness as profit, there will be no troubles. Today, there is endless turmoil because people take profit as profit.</p>
<p>Considerations</p>
<p>It must be remembered that our every action immediately affects the character of the Imperial Nation. Therefore, we should be cautious in our actions, and when the time comes to act, we should do so decisively without hesitation. By doing so, we can demonstrate the awakening of the Japanese people of the Imperial Nation and have no regrets.</p>
<p>The Necessity of Preparatory Strength</p>
<p>The necessity of preparatory strength applies not only to the nation but also to individuals. For example, if one has ten units of strength and uses six or seven, using the remaining strength as preparation, one will make fewer mistakes and complete tasks successfully. If one merely seeks quick success and fame, making unrealistic demands and using all ten units of strength, one will only create self-inflicted troubles and ultimately fail. This must be remembered.

<h3 id="e21">The Largest Naval Battle in World History; A Commentary from the North China Daily News Thirty-Nine Years Ago <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Battle of Tsushima</p>
<p>(Commentary from the North China Daily News) Late in the evening of May 30, 1905, news arrived from Tokyo that Admiral Togo's Japanese navy had won a great victory in the Tsushima Strait. Admiral Togo had previously been called indecisive. Newspapers reported that Admiral Togo would likely destroy the Russian Far East Fleet and the Baltic Fleet separately before they could join forces. However, Admiral Togo believed that when the Russian fleet decided to leave port from Annam, they would take the shortest route to Vladivostok and waited silently for the opportunity to arrive. Admiral Togo then decided on a plan to intercept the enemy fleet. As expected, the Russian fleet took that route. Reports arriving yesterday from China and other places are news for which the Japanese people can be thankful.</p>
<p>The US Consul General in Nagasaki reported to Washington that the Japanese navy had sunk one Russian battleship and four other warships, as well as one auxiliary ship. According to information obtained yesterday in Shanghai, the Japanese fleet captured one battleship and one cruiser. Admiral Rozhestvensky, commander of the Russian fleet, suffered losses due to his Russian-style fatalistic strategy. This is the most profound point we, as third parties, feel. Moreover, according to a special telegram from our Tokyo office, Admiral Togo, under careful planning, deployed his fleet in a rigorous formation, preparing to annihilate the Russian fleet in one fell swoop in the Tsushima Strait. According to a special telegram from our Osaka office, Admiral Togo had indeed established a meticulous operational plan, so the cruiser Izumrud, which was extremely fast, was able to escape, along with only three small ships.</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, the center of the battle was the destroyers, and losses were minimal. On the contrary, the Russian side suffered huge losses. He also included all the great commanders from all eras in world history. This Battle of Tsushima is related to Japan's future. Japan entrusted Admiral Togo with full responsibility for the naval battle, and the dedication and struggle of the admiral and his subordinates are enough to show figures worthy of the trust of the entire Japanese people.</p>
<p>The Battle of the Sea of Japan (Commentary from the North China Daily News)</p>
<p>May 31, 1905—The 16th greatest naval battle in world history, one hundred years after the Battle of Trafalgar, was carried out by the Oriental Nelson, Admiral Togo. As a result of that naval battle, the entire Russian naval force was completely annihilated. The first thing naval history researchers should point out is that between the Battle of Trafalgar and the Battle of Tsushima, a hundred years passed, and during this period, military armaments and warfare methods underwent extraordinary changes. But there is one thing in common: the Battle of Trafalgar was the most important naval battle in England, and similarly, the Battle of Tsushima is the most important naval battle in Japan.</p>
<p>The highest commander must have foresight. The British war expert Wellington, on the crest of the mountain, could know how the enemy was acting on the other side of the mountain. Similarly, Admiral Togo also judged that the enemy Baltic Fleet would definitely take the shortest route to Vladivostok through the Tsushima Strait. Based on this presumption, he sent Admiral Uemura with a cruiser to the waters off Taiwan. Therefore, Admiral Togo did not concentrate his entire fleet in the Tsushima Strait. Before entering their final grave, the Japanese navy would never completely blockade Vladivostok to disperse their troops. Also, the commander of the Baltic Fleet believed that the straits of Tsugaru and Soya had mines and defensive patrols, so he chose to pass through the Tsushima Strait. Furthermore, Admiral Togo did not lay mines in the Tsushima Strait, because his own fleet would encounter danger with the enemy fleet.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 26, the last team of the Japanese naval reconnaissance unit reported that the Baltic Fleet was approaching Tsushima. The next morning, the Baltic Fleet was seen approaching the Tsushima Strait in two teams. The team on the right was composed of battleships, and the team on the left was composed of cruisers and small boats. There were two reconnaissance boats in front of the fleet. The Japanese fleet allowed the two ships to pass safely, and the two ships reported to the commander of the Baltic Fleet that there were no preparations along the coast of the island.</p>
<p>In this way, Vice Admiral Rozhestvensky hoped to reach Vladivostok without contacting the Japanese navy. The Japanese fleet used one ship to lure the vice admiral forward, as if there was only this warship defending the Tsushima Strait, opening fire on the Russian ships, while a large force was hidden to the northwest. The battle began on the morning of the 27th. The Japanese navy knew that taking advantage of the gaps in the Russian fleet's formation was very advantageous. Detailed reports on the battle have not yet been obtained. What we know now is based on direct telegrams from local correspondents. We previously knew that shells and torpedoes could not destroy steel ships, but the losses suffered by the Russian fleet were indeed caused by attacks from shells and torpedoes. As a result of the war, the Baltic Fleet can be said to have been completely annihilated, with only two or three cruisers escaping. The commander and senior officers were captured, more than 3,000 prisoners were taken, and the warships Oryol and Nicholas I were captured.</p>
<p>The Japanese naval battle was a tragic end for the Russian navy, which planned to rebuild its naval power in the Pacific. Russia also wanted to send out the Fourth Fleet, but this would only be a repeat of a new tragedy. As the commander of the Russian fleet said, he had indeed used all his strength, but facing the brave, calm, and unarrogant Admiral Togo, and the fleet under his command, he was naturally no match.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Key Points of the Economic Security Office's Current Policies; Statement by the First Police Bureau <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The First Police Bureau issued the following statement regarding the current policies of the Economic Security Office:</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the Economic Security Office has been reported in various newspapers. In order to realize this goal as soon as possible, the Bureau organized its structure and adjusted personnel at the beginning of this month, striving to move towards the path of fulfilling its mission as soon as possible. The purpose of establishing the Economic Security Office is well understood by the citizens. In short, it is to implement the wartime special criminal laws, economic control regulations, and various regulations promulgated by relevant economic agencies of the National Government. On the one hand, it will support various economic institutions in Shanghai. At the same time, it will crack down on essential consumer goods that directly affect the lives of citizens, which is the focus of the current policies of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office.</p>
<p>The notices issued by the Economic Department of the First District Public Office this time, regarding the registration of stockpiles of matches, candles, soap, and coal, and the reporting of sales and transfers, are measures to investigate the exact quantity of the aforementioned essential consumer goods and then suppress price increases to stabilize people's lives. This is not a forced purchase. The Bureau has repeatedly stated this. Therefore, we hope that the owners and custodians of these materials will deeply understand the Bureau's intention and promptly carry out registration and reporting. Those who refuse to register or conceal quantities will be severely punished in accordance with the Anti-Hoarding Act and other laws.</p>
<p>Unified Implementation of Economic Controls</p>
<p>The establishment of the Economic Security Office will enable the centralization of economic controls within its jurisdiction. In the past, various agencies and police stations in the First District had the authority to implement economic controls. Now, the Economic Security Office will be responsible for all of this. Police officers who are not economic police officers cannot exercise their authority in matters of economic violations. In the future, the economic work undertaken by other agencies will be limited to the investigations necessary for administrative policy. This point should be especially noted. The distinction between general police officers and economic police officers is outlined below:</p>
<p>Distinction Between Economic Police Duties</p>
<p>Economic police officers must hold an economic police certificate with the seal of the Director of the First Police Bureau and must present the certificate to the other party when performing their duties.</p>
<p>When performing their duties, whether wearing a uniform or not, they should wear a brown armband with a yellow background, bearing the seal of the Director of the First Police Bureau and a number.</p>
<p>When performing their duties, they must be in groups of two or more and are strictly prohibited from working alone.</p>
<p>The Economic Security Office will cooperate closely with various agencies to implement effective controls. The public is urged to have an accurate understanding of and closely assist the Bureau's intentions. Economic police officers who engage in corrupt conduct will be severely punished. If citizens discover that police officers are engaging in corruption, they should record the date, location, police officer's name, and number and report it to the Director of the First Police Bureau or the Director of the Inspection Office.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Collection of Teachers' Subsidy Fees Must Comply with Promulgated Methods; Statement by Director Lin of the Education Bureau <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the collection of teachers' living subsidies from students' parents by public and private primary and secondary schools in this city, the Municipal Education Bureau has formulated detailed methods and issued orders for their implementation. Recently, it has been learned that some schools are not following the Bureau's orders. In order to prevent abuses, Director Lin of the Education Bureau issued the following statement:</p>
<p>This time, the collection of teachers' living subsidies has received the enthusiastic assistance of relevant officials, authorities, and members of society, which has enabled the maintenance of education in this city. We are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>All teachers' living subsidies collected by the schools shall be used for the living subsidies of the teachers in the respective schools.</p>
<p>The teachers' living subsidies are divided into four categories: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. Parents are free to determine which category to contribute based on their ability. Parents from poor families may declare their actual circumstances and be exempted from making a contribution. Parents from wealthy families who are enthusiastic about education and sympathize with teachers are welcome to donate more than 100 yuan. There are also reward measures in place.</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Municipal Chinese Newspaper reported that the Municipal He'an Primary School was collecting this subsidy without following the Bureau's methods. The principal was immediately summoned to the Bureau for reprimand and ordered to correct the situation.</p>
<p>It is also heard that a small number of schools are violating the Bureau's methods and forcing parents to donate 100 yuan per month. This is unreasonable and improper. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate and punish those responsible, the Bureau still hopes that all parents will comply with the methods promulgated by the Bureau (as published in various city newspapers on the 7th of this month) and cooperate in correcting the situation. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>When making a donation, parents should request the "Certificate for Determining Living Expenses Subsidies for Public and Private Schools" from the school authorities. After filling in the amount of their own contribution (one of the four types: 20 yuan, 30 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan) in the required format, they should donate it and request the return of the receipt stamped by the Bureau.</p>
<p>As of 3:00 PM on the 22nd of this month, 13 private schools had submitted receipts for the collected subsidies to the Bureau for stamping (including Yiye Primary School, Newspaper Workers' Children's School, Bihua School, Zhaofeng School, Zide School, Peihao School, Sanmin School, Yakai School, Guanbei School, Zhongguo School, Chunyi School, Yanguang School, and Zhenying School). It can be seen that the other schools have not yet begun to collect. Parents are requested to pay attention.</p>

<p>Regarding the rationing of cotton cloth, the Economic Bureau has ordered the distribution of purchase certificates to each household by the various district public offices. It is reported that the Third District, in order to handle matters carefully, has specially established nine temporary certificate issuing offices in the one town and four villages of Zhabei, so that residents can collect cotton cloth purchase certificates nearby. The procedures for collecting certificates are as follows: To prevent fraud, residents must present their household registration certificate, residence certificate, and personal seal, as well as household registration documents, directly to the designated issuing office to collect certificates for use by cohabiting households. If residents are between the ages of six and ten and do not have a residence certificate, they can present a household registration certificate issued by the village office to show completeness and demonstrate seriousness. In addition to ordering village heads to assist and notify residents, the dates of issuance, the number of certificates issued daily, and the locations of the issuing offices will be announced and posted in various villages. A schedule is attached to facilitate residents in collecting certificates according to the listed addresses.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Mr. Chen Youren's Corpse Cremated Yesterday, Yan Huiqing Elaborates on Chen's Life <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Youren passed away in Shanghai a few days ago. In accordance with his will to cremate his body, Mrs. Chen, to comply with Mr. Chen's last wishes, held a cremation ceremony at the Jing'an Cemetery on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (the 22nd) at 3 PM. Friends of Mr. Chen who attended the funeral included Yan Huiqing, Wen Zongyao, Zheng Hongnian, Zhao Jinxiang, Lin Kanghou, Shen Siliang, Gu Nanqun, Chen Shao, Chen Binhe, Li Guohua, and approximately two hundred others, including Major General Kawamoto, the Shanghai Army Minister from the Allied Japanese side, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Yushida Tosuke, and relatives. At precisely 3 PM, a memorial service was held before the altar, where Dr. Yan Huiqing briefly recounted Mr. Chen's life, and Li Weichen spoke on behalf of the Chen family to express gratitude. The body was then cremated.</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing briefly described Mr. Chen's life, saying: "I first met Mr. Chen in Tianjin in the first year of the Republic of China (1912). At that time, Mr. Chen was returning to the country for the first time, and his ambition to serve the motherland as an overseas Chinese was truly admirable. For decades, I served in the diplomatic field with Mr. Chen, and there are several aspects of his life that I deeply admire: His patriotism. Mr. Chen was an overseas Chinese from Trinidad, educated abroad. Once he heard of the establishment of the Republic of China, he abandoned his comfortable foreign life and returned thousands of miles to serve the motherland. This was entirely an expression of patriotism. His superb knowledge. Mr. Chen devoted himself to learning throughout his life, never slacking off. The articles Mr. Chen wrote in English were unmatched even by famous figures in England and America. His writing contained no hint of falseness, but was entirely meticulously crafted and sincere. Readers, regardless of whether their views were the same as Mr. Chen's, were invariably moved. His grand ambitions. Mr. Chen was a statesman, not a politician. He returned to the motherland to serve with great ambitions. He admired Premier Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of civil rights, and especially agreed with it. Externally, he hoped to make China equal in the international community. Internally, he hoped that China could become a truly republican country. Although Mr. Chen once held office, he believed that holding office was a means to achieve his ambitions, which was completely different from politicians who take holding office as their goal. When his ambitions were not realized, Mr. Chen abandoned his official position and refused to serve, his integrity shining brightly, which is truly admirable. Looking at Mr. Chen's life as a whole, it is very similar to that of Premier Sun Yat-sen. Mr. Chen passed away in the current environment, his ambitions unfulfilled. I imagine that the main points of his last words were the two sentences that Premier Sun said at his deathbed: 'The revolution has not yet succeeded, comrades still need to work hard.'"</p>

<p>In view of the difficult lives of teachers and staff at Hongli Primary and Secondary School in this city, the municipal government has been subsidizing 500,000 yuan per month since the last semester, which has been fully distributed by the Municipal Education Association. The Municipal Education Association has once again requested subsidies for private school teachers and staff for this semester, and the municipal government has approved the continued subsidy. However, the Municipal Education Association has only received 500,000 yuan for February so far, which is scheduled to be issued by the end of this month. The Municipal Education Association is actively urging the municipal government to issue the 500,000 yuan each for March and April.</p>

Li Yichen took advantage of the situation and directly entered the goal, scoring the first point. The first half temporarily ended. After the intermission, the Republic of China team remained unchanged. Jia Youliang received Zheng Yingquan's ball, passed it to Lan Niu, and Li Yichen used a borrowed knife to kill.

<h3 id="e36">National Forum: Parental Opinions on Slightly Increasing Subsidies <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>One</p>
<p>Life is difficult, and families are suffering. How can parents bear to let their children drop out of school! However, the burden of tuition and miscellaneous fees is a serious pressure. Recently, schools have started to levy subsidies. According to the notice from Nanguang Primary and Secondary School, it is approved by the Education Association. However, according to its method, it first says that it will be from now until the end of the semester; then it says that it will be from May to July, with amounts ranging from 100 to 300 yuan, and it must be paid in full for three months at once.</p>
<p>The end of this semester is the end of June, and the summer vacation starts on July 1st. Since it says until the end of the semester, how should the words "before" and "until" be interpreted? Is it necessary for parents to subsidize during the vacation! Alas, it is really impossible to know whether this contradictory move by the school is opportunistic or not! Parents, parents, it is a situation of both crying and laughing - (A poor parent)</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Tonight, I received a notice from the school through my child, which seems to say: According to the instructions of the authorities, each parent must pay a subsidy of 300 yuan from now on. With the rising cost of living, the lives of teachers are indeed difficult, but do all the parents of students have money? I hope the authorities will instruct each school to have wealthy parents pay the subsidy, while those who cannot afford it will be exempt. In this way, we who are poor can bear a little less burden, and the school will not force the collection of fees. (Chen Bingwen)</p>

<h3 id="e37">Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute, Working Hard, Welcomes Visitors from All Walks of Life <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>In the spring of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association announced its dissolution. At that time, Mr. Yuan Lihui and Mr. Huang Yuqi, witnessing the general homeless refugees wandering the streets, which was bound to form beggars, which was very pitiful, resolutely founded the Shanghai Poor Children's Craft Institute in Fahua Town, laying the foundation for this institute. In the 31st year, Mr. Zhang Lianfang continued to maintain and expand the institute and moved it to No. 99 Jisi Feier Road, managing it diligently and sparing no effort. However, the rising cost of living was endless, and the living expenses of more than 300 refugee children, this huge expenditure, finally became a problem. Should they be dismissed? How can we bear to let this group of lost lambs wander? At that time (winter of the 31st year), the directors of the institute invited Mr. Chen Fukang to take over, and with Mr. Chen's enthusiasm, running around and appealing, the institute was finally moved to No. 1318 Zhonghua Road, Nanshi (the current site), and a second institute was opened in Wenmiao Road, which can be regarded as not failing the expectations of people in society.</p>
<p>Teaching and Cultivation Combined</p>
<p>In addition to providing food and clothing for the children, the institute also ran a half-day full primary school and opened three workshops (sewing department, mesh bag department, towel department), and a temporary design of a small handicraft, so that they have the opportunity to study and practice, and develop a spirit of self-reliance. When they leave the institute in the future, they can all stand on their own feet in society. As for the institute's band, it has long been praised by social members, and their traces can be seen in funerals and large-scale gatherings. The institute's hygiene facilities, in addition to hiring a hospital , also set up a medical room ○ ward, in addition to self-diagnosis of mild cases, the remaining more serious illnesses, by the hospital sent to Yongchuan Hospital and Nanshi Civilian Hospital for diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>In terms of funding, in addition to Director Chen's efforts to raise funds, most of it relies on the institute's students' handicraft production, such as weaving wool, knitting mesh bags, and sewing clothes. Others rely on donations from various clubs in Nanshi. Now, the production of the factory has been interrupted due to the interruption of raw materials and cannot start work, and the various clubs have successively announced their closure. Therefore, recently, the institute's funding has been very difficult. To express openness, from May 1st, visits are welcome. At the same time, we hope that benefactors from all walks of life will provide material donations so that the institute's more than 200 poor children can continue to learn art.</p>

<p>Iwatada Yu, translated by Hong Hongyang</p>
<p>(I haven't forgotten...)</p>
<p>Sitting in a rural bus, from Mannaga station to Kurihama, I kept saying this kind of thing in my heart.</p>
<p>Along the way, there was a slope. Wild grass ears were swayed by the sea breeze. Soon after, a blue sea appeared in front of me. This day was a clear autumn day. However, he had no intention of appreciating it.</p>
<p>(Yes. I have not forgotten. Have not forgotten.)</p>
<p>His eyes were full of tears, and he couldn't help but continue to think about the "lover" of the past.</p>
<p>"End of the line, please get off!"</p>
<p>The conductor noticed him, and he got off the bus in a hurry.</p>
<p>In front of him was a deserted and quiet seaside rest area. The white strip with the words "House of the Sea" written on it was half broken, and military curtains were wrapped around it. The sea was just in front of him, like a piece of blue paper, very quiet.</p>
<p>Rather than saying it was quiet, it was better to say it was blurred. That was his feeling about the coast. There was no one walking on the streets along the coast. Longfu stood there, looking at the beach as if he didn't know where to go.</p>
<p>"Where is the Kurihama Hotel?"</p>
<p>He finally found a few children playing by the sea and asked.</p>
<p>"Isn't it over there?"</p>
<p>Although summer had passed, the child, still wearing shorts, thought the question was superfluous, because it was something he should know, so the tone of the answer was not very pleasant. Longfu looked in the direction the child pointed, and saw a vertical street.</p>
<p>As if he had lost hope of recuperating, he walked listlessly towards that road. He found the sign of the Kurihama Hotel on the third door at the intersection. Although it was a two-story building, it was a very simple room. It was a bit unfair to call it a hotel, but it actually looked like a small restaurant. Although he said this, it took a long time for a woman to come out of the kitchen. The landlady, who looked like a fisherman's wife, stared at Longfu with a very peculiar look. When she saw the introduction letter written by a colleague, she said with relief, "Please come in! We only have summer rooms here, but it's okay for a rest, maybe</p>
<p>Saying this, she led him to the second floor. The children on the second floor had lowered the partitions, creating a desolate space.</p>
<p>"In the summer, we rent it to elementary school students from Tokyo. We haven't finished cleaning up yet. Please choose a room you like! I'll do it right away</p>
<p>The landlady said to herself and ran downstairs.</p>
<p>Longfu, like a tired traveler, fell on the faded child, not caring about anything. From the window, he could not see the sea, but only the color of the sea, showing the vast sky.</p>
