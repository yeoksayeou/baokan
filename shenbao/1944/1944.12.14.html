<h3>日特攻隊及空軍　在巴帕海面戰果　沉毀敵驅逐艦運輸船七艘</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午三時十分發表：日軍特別攻擊隊石腸·八紘·丹心飛行隊之各一部與其他飛行隊，同於十二月十二日突擊雷伊泰西岸巴帕海面之敵運輸船團，獲得戰果如次：轟擊沉運輸船二艘，驅逐艦三艘，炸毀起火運輸船一艘，驅逐艦一艘。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日特攻隊及空軍，自敵在雷伊泰島阿爾別拉附近登陸以來，即連日出動攻擊，對急謀强化補給之敵運輸船團，施以强襲，予敵補給綫以重大打擊。日特別攻擊隊之石腸·八紘·丹心各隊之一部，亦於十二日在雷伊泰西岸搜擊敵有力船團，突入其中部，其全部飛機已悉數命中敵船團，收獲偉大戰果，使敵不寒而慄。在以上戰役中，日特攻隊暨其他機隊，曾有若干架因自炸未歸還，惟此次未歸還之日機，似亦曾與特攻隊同時拚撞敵艦，同歸於盡，蓋旣在第一綫，則不論是否特攻隊，亦當以特攻隊之精神實行拚撞作戰，使敵物量悉被破摧也。至於一宇·八紘·靖國·石腸·丹心各機隊姓名及其所獲戰果，亦已由日大本營十三日之發表，分別說明，一宇隊係於七日進襲奧爾莫克灣，沉毀敵艦型未詳艦艇二艘，八紘隊·靖國隊實行拚撞敵艦船，由此而知，在日航空部隊砲毀敵大型運輸船三艘，炸沉敵登陸用舟艇十艘之戰果中，當係包括該靖國·八紘兩隊之戰果內。此外，石腸隊亦曾於八日在奧爾莫克灣，卡瑪泰斯海面轟炸敵船團。日掩護戰鬥機，且曾與敵機遭遇，演成熾烈空戰，但戰果今仍未能確認，惟最低限度，已命中敵艦船，使其受若干損害。至丹心隊飛機六架所獲之戰果，亦不爲不大，計炸沉敵大型運輸船二艘，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘，大型登陸用舟艇二艘，擊毀敵大型運輸船一艘，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘，合計七艘</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地十三日中央社電　日航空部隊十日下午轟炸雷伊泰北方之比里朗島西岸，擊毀敵方帆船二艘。</p>
<h3>愛知靜岡昨空襲邀擊戰果調查中　東京四國地區亦有敵機侵入</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　日大本營十三日下午七時發表：（一）馬里亞納羣島之敵B29型機約八十架，曾於十三日下午各以少烽編隊襲入東京附近及四國地方，並以主力來製愛知·靜岡兩縣地方，關於邀擊戰果，現正調查中。（二）愛知·靜岡兩縣地區雖受若干損害，其他地域俱無損失。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機，近迭以少數機隊對東京附近作游擊式之來襲，一方以少數機偵察北海道地區，十三日敵機約八十架來襲，轟炸愛知·靜岡地方工廠地帶，混合投下炸彈及燒夷彈，是日敵機一架自耙伊半島西南端飛向四國地方，又三槃於東京附近實行牽制，主力則襲炸愛知·靜岡兩縣。日制空部隊與軍官民一致奮鬥努力防衛，被害極少，來襲東京及四國地方之敵機，未投一彈，當即退去，故無損害。</p>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　十三日下午一時半，曾有敵B29型機約四十架，各以數架編隊，分襲日中部地區，即名古屋·濱松方面，於各地上投彈數枚，日軍當行邀擊，似已獲莫大戰果，現正詳細調查中，惟所受損害却極輕微。又敵機一架至二架，同時並侵入朝鮮西部及京漢地區，然因日各地邀擊體制異常燭密，故敵機即行倉惶遁去。</p>
<h3>日軍在摩島　突擊戰果</h3>
<p>南方前線基地十三日中央社電　摩羅泰島日軍突擊隊，呼應空軍攻擊敵機場四周守備部隊，於十月十六日登陸後，當夜以來至十二月六日，計殺傷敵二百九十五名（內飛機駕駛員四十名），毀幕棚十，機關槍一，日方無損害。</p>

<h3>渝方取締　厭戰書籍</h3>
<p>廣東十三日中央社電　渝當局因戰局之轉變，爲防止民心動搖，昻揚戰意，自今春以來，曾用盡各種手叚。據最近自抗戰地區歸來之一文化人稱，電慶今春以來，對文化人之壓迫益加嚴厲，尤其對出版物更特別注意。國民黨中央執行委員會西南執行部，對此特設置西南出版物編審會，實施檢閱一切刋物，據最近之統計，於政治經濟，社會，文化各種國內外書籍千數百部中，其中約六成係鼓吹共產主義思想者。重慶當局認爲該種左傾書籍係厭戰思想之表白，已開始禁止。該類出版書籍之中，主要者係高爾基之「法國革命與階級鬥爭」，及對各國之政治，經濟評論，以及魯迅以下胡適·郭沫若·田漢·等一流作家之作品，多數皆在禁止之例</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>節約儲材</h3>
<p>四年以來，本報承讀者諸君熱心助學，慷槪捐款，歷屆補助學生人數自一〇〇五增至四六五八，核發助金自三萬餘元增至一千四百餘萬元，每人平均所得助金自三十三元增至三千零四十七元。這些數字非但足以表示讀者諸君樂善好施互助合作的精神，更足以證明敎育救國的信念已經深入人心，在這非常時期，大家尤其感覺到國民的程度必需提高，各種的人才必需培植，靑年的學業決不容其停頓中輟！</p>
<p>現在第八屆助金的徵募運動已經開始。由於物體的極快增進，下學期各校學費大槪至少比本學期增加一倍。我們預算至少必需募得助學金三千萬元，才可以勉强維持原有受助學生四千多人的學業。如果學費的增加比例超過一倍，如果我們計劃擴大補助範圍，在原有受助學生以外招考新生，這數目當然還不够。</p>
<p>三千萬元初看是一個很大的數目。目下助金存款尚不滿一千萬元，所以必需在最短期間募到二千萬元以上，這似乎不很容易。但根據以往的經騐，我們相信這目標是不難達到的，是不難超過的。第一屆所發助金只有三萬餘元，第二屆增至五萬餘元，第三屆增至十四萬元，第四屆增至二十三萬元，第五屆增至一百三十八萬元，第六屆增至三百二十五萬元，第七屆增至一千四百十九萬元。自第一屆至第七屆旣能增加四百餘倍，自第七屆至第八屆可以說必然會再增加二三倍的。</p>
<p>現在物價暴漲，生活艱難，這種情形，一方面當然使許多家長本能負擔自己子弟的學費，但另一方面不一定就會減少大衆熱心助學的力量。因爲近來一切投資的利息優厚，所以窮苦的人雖然多，整個社會的財力未必低落。相反的，我們相信現在能捐十萬八萬的人比戰前能捐一百二百的人還多，在有力量的人，現在捐數萬元比戰前捐數十元還容易。</p>
<p>讀者諸君試想：現在全國—全世界有多少地方還可以像上海這樣舒適自由的居住？有多少人家不流離失所家破人亡？有多少人不困苦顚沛飢寒交迫？想到了這些情形，怎能不覺得能够安居能够溫飽已是極大幸運？怎有心腸消耗不必要的金錢，去交換過度的物質享受？怎有心腸不努力節約，共襄善舉，爲子孫造福，爲人羣造福？</p>
<p>現在只要有心節約，隨時隨地可以省下很可觀的數目。少宴一次客，少吃一頓點心，少看一次戲，甚至少乘一次三輪車或黃包車，都是帮助淸寒子弟不使失學的方法。有力量的可以多省些，多捐些，當然最好。力量小的不妨少省些，少捐些，積少成多，也是同樣的造福社會，有益人羣！</p>
<p>節約儲材是最有意義的工作，也是最急迫的工作。本報敬懇讀者諸君各盡其力！</p>
<h3>各省市綏署　成立政訓處　處長由軍委會委派</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電　上月底政府當局召開全國軍政會議以後，對於全國軍政一元化，極度强調。軍事委員會爲期使全國各軍部隊，與當地政府取得密切連繫起見，對政訓工作積極强化。過去各省市綏靖公署，曾有政訓處之組織，全予撤銷，刻軍委會特再令各省市綏靖公署成立政訓處。處長一職由軍委會派遣，至於組織機構與現有各方面軍委會直屬各部隊政訓處相同，設處長一人（少將級），科長二人（上校中校級），科員四人（少校上尉級），並已派定何堅白爲駐杭州綏靖公署政訓處處長，張宗甲爲駐徐州綏靖公署政訓處處長，鄔藍生爲駐蚌埠綏靖公署政訓處處長，均已分別就職視事。</p>

<h3>台灣東方海面　航空戰追記</h3>
<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>這次敵美抰其自詡最優秀的機動部隊，企圖實現太平洋上反攻作戰計劃。自十月初迄今，可分三個戰役階段，首爲台灣東方海面航空戰，次爲菲律賓東方海面海戰，繼之爲雷伊泰島攻防戰。台菲海戰中敵美損失機動部隊之大半，雷伊泰島登陸部隊亦正在圍殲中。</p>
<p>關於台菲戰役經過，已有報道消息，茲綜合東京消息，依次追記，藉明戰况一班：</p>
<p>目標是航空母艦</p>
<p>十月初以來，美機動部隊在馬里亞納羣島方面蠢動的形跡，早爲日方察知，而他們行將進擾琉球羣島及台灣，以作攻略菲律賓的前奏，也在意料之中。迨至十日晨，美機動部隊果然出現於琉球羣島，以艦載機空襲冲繩方面。當時，日海軍爲期愼重起見，乃於靜中待動，等待黃昏時分返歸基地的紫敵機。據偵察員的報告，在其哨戒區域內，尚未發見敵影。這時，別的索敵機猶在繼續搜索中。到了十一日午前三時，日方的索敵機終於在黑暗的洋上用電波兵器捉住美機動部隊，徐徐接近。由其行動看來，美機動部隊顯有離開琉球羣島而南下的企圖。十一日黎明以後，各哨戒區域的警戒更嚴，美機動部隊的南下企圖，也更加確實。因此，日軍不得不立即出以攻勢，開始追擊。攻擊準備迅速完成。</p>
<p>十二日午前三時，索敵機探知分爲四羣的美機動部隊正在台灣東方行動中。同日淸晨，合灣發出了空獲警報。</p>
<p>這支機動部隊是十日進犯琉球羣島後再出現於合灣的？還是另外一支呢？這且不去管它，要之，他們打算暫時固着於台灣方面而對台灣實行大規模的空襲，則是無疑的。等待着的良機終於來臨，當即擬好周密的攻擊計劃。是時，官古島·石垣島·奄美大島等琉球羣島一帶，發出了空襲警報。</p>
<p>待機已久的基地上，頓時緊張起來。飛行塲上，各種精銳的飛機整裝待發，短小精悍的指揮官對其決心一死報國的部下指示機宜道：</p>
<p>「目標是航空母艦，特別是火型航空母艦。祗要徹底打擊航空母艦，我相信日本必定勝利。希望大家奮鬥到底，以期擊滅敵軍，並祝各位成功。」</p>
<p>發現航母輪型陣</p>
<p>攻擊機隊出發以後，戰鬥指揮所的昏黃電燈光下，指揮官久野大佐以下全體幕僚，都保持着沈默，靜待前方的捷報。未幾，索敵機捉住敵方機動部隊的常報來了。大家的額上，爲之一亮。索敵機已經發見敵軍機動部隊四羣中的三羣，正集中精神發見其餘一羣。接着，攻擊機隊與敵接觸的報告也來了。戰鬥開始啦！以後，捷報紛至沓來，第一次的攻擊是得手了。</p>
<p>十二日晚，是沒有月亮的黑夜。戰塲附近，受到季節風的影響，到了夜裏，濃雲密佈，下起陣雨來。天氣惡劣非常，視界極狹。這本不宜於夜間攻擊，但久經嚴格訓練的日本航空部隊，反利用這種天氣，在黑暗的洋上，捉住擁有大型航空母艦的美艦隊的輪型陣。此夜的攻擊隊中，有山口縣出身的T兵曹長，他曾經參加馬來洋面海戰，擊沉英國戰艦雷巴爾斯號。</p>
<p>這時候已雨過天淸。I兵曹長借着淡淡的星光，降低高度，仔細搜索敵蹤，不久便和輪型陣外廓接觸。敵方的防禦砲火，非常猛烈。同時，有六架夜間戰鬥機飛來挑戰。I兵曹長一面應付截擊的敵機，一面改變針路，向前衝去。但因發覺目標並非航空母艦，而是戰艦或巡洋艦，當又改變雷擊針路，終於找到了大型航空母艦，立即投下魚雷。未幾，轟隆一聲，海上湧起了很高的水柱，敵艦吐出熊熊的火舌，魚雷命中了離艦首的三分之一處的艦腹。數分鐘後，這艘航空母艦便沉入海底。這時，某大尉也向一艘敵艦發射魚雷，不幸所駕的飛機被敵彈命中油箱，於是他便駕着冒火的飛機，掉轉頭來，向敵軍航空母艦撞去。</p>
<p>這樣，在十二日的夜間攻擊中，共計擊沉航空母艦四艘，擊毀航空母艦一艘，及艦型不詳者十一艘，日機也有若干架未曾歸還。其中有的和某大尉一樣壯烈自炸，有的則因機件發生故障及燃料用罄等等原因，不克艦返基地</p>
<p>勇敢無比的衝撞</p>
<p>及至十三日，形勢稍異。從十二日夜到十三日零時止，據索敵機的偵察，美機動部隊分爲數羣，在台灣東方一帶繼續蠢動，其用意當然是企圖再襲台灣。他們在十二日夜間受到相當打擊機，已從後方調來二十餘隻由商船改裝成功的航空母艦，打算憑恃數量來挽回頽勢。</p>
<p>是日的攻擊，和前日一樣，也集中力量於攻擊航空母艦，索敵機與攻擊機依次出發。戰塲附近，與十二日的情形相同，雲層分爲上下二重，下面正在下着很大的陣雨。這種形勢很有利於攻擊方面。通過了烏雲，隱隱望見敵艦隊列成單縱陣，他們大約鑒於前日的不幸，由分散改爲密集的隊形。長井海軍大尉所駕的指揮官機，首先衝向大型航空母艦，投以必中的巨彈，並壯烈地連人帶機的撞上去。隨後各機看到隊長的果敢行爲，更爲振奮，一齊瘋狂似地各自認定目標，殺將過去，結果，轟沉航空母艦三艘，及巡洋艦或驅逐艦一艘，此外，並擊毀航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦各一艘。</p>
<p>敵艦陰不支潰退</p>
<p>十四日晨，綜合各方面的情報，本來分做四羣的美艦隊，受到十二，十三兩天的致命打擊後，整頓殘兵，縮小爲二羣，而且已不若先前的意氣揚揚，其中有不少是負了傷的。這日早最，敵方的艦載機又來空襲台灣各地，但機數已減少了許多。美機動部隊顯然已在掩護退却了，於是日軍的追擊戰即刻展開。這時，陸軍雷擊機隊也參加追擊，此外並有別的部隊。這一天，在白畫强襲以後，到了晚上，陸海軍部隊更通力合作，展開夜襲，結果轟擊沉航空母艦三艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦三艘，擊毀航空母艦及巡洋艦各二艘，並重創驅逐艦一艘，艦型不詳者二艘，此外，敵艦中彈起火者五艘。</p>

<h3>東京昭南間鐵道　一年內可全通　物資交流從此更趨圓滑</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電　廣西省方面南北日軍，終於本月十日於南寗西南約七十公里之綏淥會師，故大陸縱斷路業已打通，自東京至昭南或仰光之（共榮圈特急號）列軍，恐不久亦將實現。自然由昭南仰光或其他各地至東京者，亦當於同時實現之。此大陸縱斷鐵路之幹綫，亦當於同時實現之。此大陸縱斷鐵路之幹綫，係以東京爲起點，經釜山·奉天·北京·然後由京漢綫至漢口，轉粵漢綫經衝陽·柳州·南寗·鎮南關·入越南，經河內·塔那浦·盤谷·至昭南，如去仰光，則由盤谷專車即可。計自東京至昭南共一萬八百七十八里，以九日十一小時即可到達。此外另一路綫，乃自東京至長崎，由海航至上海，經杭州·金華·南昌·株州·再與前路綫聯絡，此綫自上海至昭南間，爲五千五百公里，自東京至昭南僅需四日廿三小時，其間路綫因尚未完成之部分，但其間距離合計僅爲八百四十公里，若從事建設，僅一年即可。假若東京及昭南雙方每日通車一次，則一年間可運輸四五千萬噸之物資，及乘客十五萬人。又此綫全通後，關於中國新出產之煤鐵，馬來出產之錫瑩石等，當可着手開發。而各地農產物亦可大量增加，同時物資之交流，以及軍事·政治·經濟上，均可獲得良好之效果也</p>
<p>華南前綫十三日中央社電　南寗乃駐渝美空軍廣西省內之最後據點，日軍佔領該地後，仍繼續攻擊第六十五第五十六及第百五十九各軍，由桂林·柳州·向南寗西北山嶽地帶逃遁，企圖奪回南寗，日軍猛烈前進，藉求與由安南進攻廣西之日安南派遣軍易於取得連絡。該部隊於十一月二十九日佔領黎墟（南寗西北八十公里，）坡造墟（南寗西北九十公里，）三十日佔領果德（南寗西北百公里，）同時一部日軍由麗水南岸向西南急進，本月十日卒與派遣軍即與日安南派遣軍連絡成功，同時大陸縱斷路之偉業亦全部成功。</p>
<p>昭南十三日南京中央社電　華南日軍與越南日軍，十日於綏淥會師，東京昭南間縱貫路綫，於是打通。值茲捷報，昭南特別市長內藤氏，於十二日發表談話如次：此次之偉業，使東京昭南間接之鐵道聯絡可得實現，此與昭南之影響殊大。現鐵道未通之處，僅餘八百四十公里，其工程傳於一年內可得完成。因此大東亞中心之東京與南方地區中心之昭南，可直接連通。並於東京昭南間之電信電話，更可利用既存之電綫而通，茲日軍戰力頓强，僅此完遂戰爭勝利之日，已快到來。一方因縱貫路綫之打通，使日本本土及滿洲國·中華民國·越南·泰國·緬甸·印度自由臨時政府·馬來·彼此間之聯絡，當可密切。大東亞因之更加一層接近，亞西亞一體之理念，已具體表現，因此昭南所負使命更見重大。</p>

<h3>台菲洋面大海戰　日軍佔絕對優勢　松島報道部長演講詞大意</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社長電　日本海軍協會十二日舉行大東亞三週年紀念會，松島報道部長演講云：值茲大東亞戰爭已進入第四年，中日兩國應更一致協力，防止英美侵入中國，以期擊滅敵人野望，刻日本正以菲律賓爲中心，與敵人展開一大決戰。茲將最近戰況，向諸君略述之。</p>
<p>此次之決戰，如敵美首腦部過去屢次所言，敵方之野心欲奪回菲島，並在中國沿岸登陸，與日本展開最後之決戰，而由於歐洲戰局，及美國國內情勢之困難，因之美國對此舉其無慮亦日趨深刻。根據敵方宣傳，以麥克澳塞所率之二十萬兵力，從新幾內亞方面推進，並由尼米資所率之太平洋艦隊之全力，予以支援。係以戰艦至少十餘艘，航空母艦六十艘左右，爲基幹之大部隊。美國將此分爲</p>
<p>南北二軍　北軍係由第三艦隊司令哈爾塞所率領，南軍則由第五艦隊司令長官斯普魯安斯所率領，於九月十五日開始攻擊帛琉及摩奈泰島方面，而揭開大戰之序幕。敵軍在摩奈泰島略獲些微之戰果，但在帛琉方面，因日陸海軍之奮戰，蒙受莫大損害，而處境於進退維谷之中。敵軍焦慮之餘，乃決意一舉在菲島登陸，其問復以哈爾塞之第三艦隊，於十月十日起空襲琉球及台灣，企圖切斷日本本土與菲島方面之補給路綫，於是決戰展開，待機已久之日本聯合艦隊，遂毅然崛起。蓋敵方於十月十一日前後有飛機一千餘架來襲台灣全島，是日夜半，日方聯合艦隊航空部隊與陸軍航空部隊，一致協力，在台灣東方海面邀擊敵機，至十四日止，已予敵第三艦隊以殲滅之打擊。美國對其損害，諱莫如深，秘而不宣。但美方損害之重大，</p>
<p>不難想像　蓋十一月間，美第三艦隊之精銳，第五十八機動部隊指揮官米捷斯，於逃歸聖第牙哥軍港後，曾謂在美國補給綫已延長之今日，欲期從速收穫戰果實不可能。此對美第五艦隊從速北上，以收容由北方退卻之友軍，并對呂宋島方面，不斷空襲菲島方面日海陸軍航空部隊之精銳，在此新戰場，冒惡劣之天氣，繼續活躍。然敵方乘此間隙，自十月十九日起至二十日止，使三個師團之兵力，在雷伊泰島之主要目的，恐係在切斷呂宋島與民大諾島之連絡，再至中國南海。日本聯合艦隊水上部隊，遂於此際毅然奮起。日本精銳艦隊，再於十月二十五日晨，在薩馬爾島東方海面突然出現，首先攻擊敵方有力機動部隊，予以重創。二十六日日艦一部，復突入碇泊在雷伊泰灣內之敵輸送船團及戰艦　中，而重創敵艦船。自</p>
<p>台灣洋面　航空戰以來，綜計敵艦隊之損失，被擊沉毀戰艦至四十餘艘，航空母艦五十餘艘，及其他大小艦船二百數十艘，以及飛機一千餘架。此次海戰恐爲大東亞戰爭中最大海戰之一，吾人於茲可獲五點觀感：（一）日本海軍之實力，已佔絕對優勢。（二）美國艦隊之防禦力極其貧弱。（三）日本之戰略及戰術實出敵美之意外，并佔光發制人之利。又如在雷伊泰灣之「衝入戰術」，尤爲奇巧。（四）日陸海軍之緊密協力，與將士忠勇之行動，已確立不敗之態勢。（五）敵方補給綫愈延長，其困難愈多。又如神風特別攻擊隊及陸軍特別攻擊隊，向敵艦勇猛撞擊，收穫必中必勝之成果。此種殉忠之壯舉，乃爲日本所獨特之戰術，敵美實難模倣，尤爲世人所敬佩。蓋因此種行爲殺身成仁之實踐，　後敵方伺隙自南方使輸送船團侵入，以謀接濟雷伊泰島，復以殘敗之艦艇編成</p>
<p>機動部隊　自十一上旬起至中旬止，使其在呂宋島東方海面開始行動，以圖挽回敗勢。但每次均遭日方航空部隊及潛水艦隊之攻擊，而遭受莫大損害。至於雷伊泰島陸上日方陸軍部隊，繼續冒惡劣天氣，猛攻敵軍，逐漸獲得後方有力部隊之增援。如日前日大本營所發表者，日方落下傘部隊及空挺隊，已毅然在敵方機場降落，仍以「衝入戰術」壓制敵軍。今敵方已一再廣播雷伊泰島作戰之困難矣。又十二月五日左右，敵方復使由船艇七十八艘編成之輸送船團，從雷伊泰南方斯黎高海峽侵入卡麥泰斯灣，日方航空部隊則在陸海兩軍特別攻擊隊之援助下，英勇邀擊，予以重創。但敵方一部兵力，似已在雷伊泰島西南岸之一角登陸，察敵方之目標，厥在西岸要衝奧爾莫克，然日方陸海軍已把握殲滅敵軍之良機，刻正在努力奮戰中。敵軍之在雷伊泰島登陸，實已展開日美一大決戰。敵軍於屢戰屢敗之餘，乃謀以遠距離轟炸B29型機等，空襲日本本土滿洲及華北等產業地帶，打擊日方產業，作爲唯一手段。然日方重要產業毫未受損，戰事今已進入第四年，中日兩國應貫澈同生共死之真諦，以挽救大東亞之整個命運，亦在此時也。美國對重慶之橫暴今已達其極點，如最近因羅斯福召還斯蒂維爾問題等，而有渝府首腦部之更迭。又納爾遜一派復藉挽救戰局之美名，而計劃戰後之經營中國，及蹂躪大東亞。敵方爲打通來多公路，而派敵機大事活動，並謀挽回頹勢，但日陸軍之雄深作戰，已粉碎敵方此種企圖，並攻戰柳州·桂林·南寗·等地，而逐漸封鎖敵空軍之活動。時至今日，太平洋中國大陸均成爲擊滅英美之決戰場，吾人應致最大努力者，厥爲防止英美軍隊之侵入中國。敵方因在資源上及人力上，均已遭受莫大困難，爲謀侵入中國而總動員其全力，企圖使中國全土</p>
<p>淪爲戰場　吾人既知今日義大利之遭遇，則中國全土淪爲戰場，不獨爲中國人之不幸，仰且爲整個大東亞之不幸，故吾人應忍受任何犧牲，努力防止此事之實現。而菲島方面之決戰，實亦可謂爲保衛中國之戰爭。其次歐洲方面，德國雖四面受敵，但仍在奮戰中。自入十二月以來，敵方之攻勢更趨熾烈，確信德國國家總動員完成後，德軍士氣之旺盛，必能予敵方以重大打擊。敵方曾一再宣傳歐洲戰局有所進展後，英美能由歐洲方面將陸海空軍移動至太平洋方面，現似欲移動其一部兵力，但由於英美關係之複雜，故其兵力之移動，恐難如其理想者。又現在印度錫蘭島方面英艦隊之動靜，極爲重視，但日軍已準備一切，決將其擊滅。今全世界已入漩渦中，如何開拓大東亞之命運，實爲中日兩國國民今後所負之重要課題。余係日本代表者之一，對於中日兩國過去之歷史，及互相間之缺點，充分認識，但今日實非談論此種歷史事實之時。</p>
<p>中日全面　和平之實現，與英美勢力之驅逐，實爲當前最重要之問題。故吾人應繼承汪先生之遺志，完成孫先生之建國偉業。最近余曾在上海訪問梅谷夫人，按梅谷　家曾對蔣先生諸多照拂，余與梅股夫人談及往事，並得觀孫先生蔣先生，以及現在渝府將領等留學日本時代之照片時，實感慨無量。余所最尊敬之軍人，爲何應欽先生。何先生之英勇姿態，仍在余紀念册中。又蔣先生與宋美齡之結婚照片，亦曾於梅谷夫人家中見之，中日兩國過去既充滿此種人情，則爲何有今日之紛爭，余深盼重慶親愛之諸君，將美國最近之政策，與日本之新政策對照。</p>
<p>加以考慮　日本今日已擁有不敗之戰果態勢，與英美作戰，而在大戰之第四年，日本惟一之希望，厥在擴大戰果，完成偉業之基礎。中國之青年在現在世界大轉變之中，負有解決中國命運，及建設大東亞之重任，今日中國實不難脫離國際情勢而獨立存在。中國必須在國際情勢中完成建國之偉業，成爲大東亞之重鎮，與汪先生前後病逝之頭山滿翁，爲實現中日親善之日本一老人。余願繼承頭山滿翁之遺志，與諸君一致協力，完成與亞偉業。最後願中國青年克服任何困難，向光明之前途勇猛邁進。</p>

<h3>請各銀行錢莊　發動集體捐款</h3>
<p>昨天發表請各界以「集體」的力量，贊助「特別勸募」，很欣幸的，正威藥房同仁首先響應，認捐一隊，真是難能可貴。照十四天來認隊捐款的情形而言，實在太失望了！本報預算每天平均收助金七十萬元，一月　可收足二千萬元，而現在差額甚距，使我們十分焦慮！其實，我們不是爲自己焦慮，是爲四千餘清寒子弟焦慮，他們眼巴巴的盼望各界熱烈捐款，而實際上並不如此，似乎抱着「袖手旁观」的態度。</p>
<p>今天，我們向銀錢業作緊急呼籲，希望錢莊的同人，依照我們昨天所定的辦法，發動「集體」的力量，實行組隊認捐。全上海銀行錢莊，總共五六百家，歷史悠久信譽卓著的，當至少在二百家以上，我們只希望這二百家行莊，先來贊助我們，每家勞資各組一隊，則三四百隊有成功可能。錢莊業爲百業之母，執金融界牛耳，爲工商業領導，諒表同情。</p>

<p>郎靜山氏的攝影藝術，不特名聞全國，而且國際著譽，這是毋庸介紹。近幾天他應新聞報與本報之請，提出傑作及其夫人雷　芝令媛郎毓賢的畫，共二百點，展覽於大新畫廳，其中選出最名貴的十幅，完全捐給新申兩報充助貸學金，指定救濟專攻農工兩科的學生，郎氏夫婦熱忱助學，殊堪敬佩。</p>
<p>記者昨在會　欣賞其作品，留連兩小時之久，可算飽餐秀色，一　無遣，可惜我對攝影並無深切研究，且無生花之筆，爲之描寫據我調查，陳列的攝影有百分之六十，曾光後參加國際影展，尤以「黃海奇峯一在國際展覽陳列共五十馀次，一次在印度展覽，觀眾投票最多。「釣罷歸來不　舟」在芝加哥榮　金獎，這兩幀已列入世界名作。</p>
<p>朗氏獻給新申兩報充助學金的十幅題名，爲「晴嵐清曉」「紅樹青山好放船」「奇峯佳樹」「雲蒸日出」「釣罷歸來不　舟」「梯徑藍與」「山村初稼」「叱咤風雲」「普賢像」及「號外一」這十幀標價五萬元競賣，熱心　眼之士，倘使選購得來，不但可享助學盛名，且得名家傑作，真是此生難得的樂事。</p>
<p>據我外行的看法，郎氏攝影技術，除取景，對光，章法，俱臻上乘外，最獨特的是「集錦」的技巧，爲一般攝影家所難能，什麽是「集錦」呢？就是攝成之影，用截長補短的方法，把幾幀良好的畫面，補入這幅不美觀的畫面，有時一張平凡的攝影，經過三四次「集錦」的方法，而製成極優美的攝影。例如「夢幻」一幀，他最初攝一頭獅，而畫面變爲三頭獅，旁邊還睡着一位裸體的美女；在不懂「集錦」法的人，就發生疑懼，以爲美女怎能裸睡在三獅之旁呢？其廣這全是運用「集錦」的技巧。據朗氏言：「照國際通例攝影是不着色的，這次爲表觀東方色彩及迎合一般人的口味，所以也多數着色，而得力於陳秉勤君的協助。「集錦」之作，多爲孤本，並不復定。此次承陳庸　，葉譽虎，夏靜觀，吳湖帆，錢厓，馬公愚，黃本玄，褚氏題咏，生色不少。一今日爲義展第五日，至二十日閉幕，各界諸君，欲一擴眼界者，盍與乎來！</p>
<h3>武漢旅情（三）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>第二天，因我上午到武昌去赴約。在歸途的船中，大家都以昨夜轟炸的慘狀爲談話資料。無意中，開始細聽船客的話了。昨夜燃燒彈造成的大火災，是漢口的難民區。該處一向從未遭受轟炸。所以轟炸漢口一劇烈，則前法租界和英租界的居民，都跑到難民區去躲避。該難民區，兩三天前我曾巡視過一次，是道路狹仄，房屋破舊，人口稠密的所在。縱想掘挖防空壕，也無地可掘。何況美國飛機又　昨夜所爲者，是不分軍事設施，普遍亂投燃燒彈的。在自以爲高枕無憂的人們房屋上，砭眼間成爲火燄山。手慌腳亂，縱想向外逃走，但被携带東西逃走的人　所擠回來，而只有拼命滾入他們的漩渦，左衝右撞。</p>
<p>自己的頭上，不斷落下燒毀的墻塊，和塌下的磚瓦。在坍塌的房屋下或許還有活人，但誰也無力關心別人的生命，瞬息間，上面的火燄，像排山倒海的怒濤一樣，吞沒了奔走逃命的人們，而人們立刻就像燒豬一樣，被燒毀了。</p>
<p>我坐的輪船一到岸，我立刻就跑向燃燒的地方去。該處仍有餘燼，但已經有回到家來整理家中燃剩下的物品的人，也有堆扶坍塌墻的人。也有尋找父親屍首的子女，也有爲燒死了嬰兒而只顧哭泣的母親。在漢口以河豚菜著名的魚菜館「劉開榜」，也燃得片瓦無存。燴魚大王劉開榜本人，也在自己的屋內燒化歸天了。有一位姓周的著名裁縫，只剩下了他一個人，而全家都成了燒死鬼。他本人業已發狂，而在市中到處喊呌「完了，完了。」漢口大名鼎鼎的律師　某，與周裁縫正相反，只自己一人死去，而家人大小八口因住在法租界，得免於難。家人回去一看，房舍沒有了，而依靠的家長也不見了，一夜光景，竟成爲無家可歸的流浪人。這類不勝枚舉的慘事，由圍繞着這一片礫瓦焦土的人們，在不斷地傳播着。各處堆積着品質惡劣的棺材。其中，自然都裝着夜裏完全破壞的「軍事設施」，在依然冒烟的瓦礫中，一定還有很多的屍體在埋着。附近充滿着生肉燒焦的臭味。此時突然看到很多人在團團地圍聚在一起。一看，原來是向棺材裏抬一個新的屍首。蓋還在開着。裏面完全是一個黑的肉塊，兩腿已經截斷，在斷處可以看見白色的大腿骨，這實在令人勉強地認出是人屍。這一肉塊，或許昨日曾站在黃鶴樓上曾感嘆歷史之悠久，或許曾背長江秋月而在甜蜜的戀愛中。假如明晚漢口還不下雨，一定像昨夜一樣，平空又不知將出現幾許死屍。或許目前在該處出神憑弔死屍者，明日又將成爲同樣肉塊，而被被他人憑弔。但這批人並不恐懼，而只是凝視這一燒焦的肉塊。在我看着好像這批人，在詳詳細細觀察自己未來不可避免的命運一樣。</p>
<p>長江</p>
<p>故人西辭黃鶴樓，烟花三月下揚州，孤帆遠影碧空盡，惟見長江天際流。</p>
<p>李白這首詩所歌頌的長江之偉大性，只有站在黃鶴樓上，才能如實地領會到。杜子美雖曾吟詠過「江從灌口來」，但長江決不是源起於四川省的灌口，而是遠自西藏高原的唐古拉及崑崙西山脈間起源的。崑崙山所積的雪，溶解成水，注入四川西康雲南等三省境的金沙江，飛般的洶湧急流，穿越於懸崖絕壁間，直至四川省宜賓（敘州），是不能用作行舟駛船的。甚至到四川省的東端奉節縣白帝城，水流仍甚急，行舟如箭，而繼續不斷地有「兩岸猿聲啼不住，輕舟已過萬重山」的奇景。但流到宜昌附近時，長江才平靜下來。而江身才寬闊起來。流到黃鶴樓下面的時候，　合洞庭湖的水，而愈益寬大，成爲浩浩無堤的排空濁流，雄糾糾氣昂昂，衝向東去。於是就展開了「星垂平野闊，月湧大江流」的雄壯揚子江之景緻。黃河既稱中國之憂（Sorrow　of　China)，那末長江自然可以稱作中國之喜（Joy　of　china）囉。這決不是單從風景方面來下的判斷。即對中華民族生活方面所賜與的影響上說，黃河長江也有這樣截然不同的區別。長江對於自己流域內的湖泊溪流，幾乎全都連接到一起，而構成一個良好的華中水田灌溉系統。該河流域，創造了世界人口最稠密的所在，農產物的種類也極其繁多。植物和動物，也有亞熱帶，溫帶，寒帶應有盡有的種類。在這條偉大的長江所經過的區域內，一直到現在仍有維持半獨立的佛教貴族政治之藏族，仍有繼續武士階級對建制度的　　族，仍有實行亂婚的一妻多夫制度之苗族，仍有臀部稍具肉尾的　族等</p>
<p>按魚類學說，該流域經雨種類之繁多，竟達七十種以上，實堪稱「鯉類王國」（Kingdom　of　carps）的盛譽。長江裏沒有鮭魚，但有俄國黑海　鮫同種的揚子江　鮫（象魚The　Yangtze　beaked　sturgeon）。此外，洞庭湖內經常有嘴尖的白旗河豚（White　Nag　dolphin）。由江口至漢口這一段長江裏，則有小鯨似的海豚（The　Indian　river　porpoise）從海中溯江而上。</p>
<p>脊椎動物，則有世界著名的四川熊貓（Giant　panda），這是熊與狸間動物分類學士最寶貴的一個種類，至於虎豹，在長江流域邊也決不希奇，也有　魚。對於揚子江沿岸的這類自然科學，中國人是不太關心的。也許是因爲中國人一向都忙於用文學讚美長江所致吧！但無論是未開化民族，也無論是動物生活，只要加以詳細研究，一定會產生　此中國人所不知道的文學，可惜中國人沒有這樣作。一位有名的人物傳記作家愛彌爾路易（Emile　Ludwig），曾在一九三六年寫過尼羅河的傳記「The　Nile　the　Life　Story　of　a　River」,如果中國人也出現一個寫洋子江傳記的作家，該多麼好！愛彌爾路易站在尼羅河畔時，曾感到這條河像一位具有生命的偉人一樣，而我站在黃鶴樓上遼望長江的時候，油然而生同樣感慨。長江的水流，的確渾濁，長江的景緻，相當平凡，但長江的水量和寬度，長度，深度，總可以稱世界河流中的巨人。假如今後中國革命成功，完全能利用這一巨人所具有的自然力的話，則中國的面目，一定會完全煥然一新。正如阿斯旺（Aswan）城建立起來水閘（Dan），則尼羅河下流的砂漠搖身一變而爲肥沃的良田一樣，亦如聶伯水電廠（Dnieprostroy）大功告成，則聶伯（Dnieper)河流域突然出現一個偉大工業都市一樣，長江所擁有的巨大水力，如加以利用，使之發電，則中國早已不必擔憂動力不足了。果如是，則長江流域上一定出現中國人從未夢想到的許多偉大工業都市。但，爲實現這樣時代，首先必須完成中國的革命任務－獨立自主－。當獨立自主澈底實現，國家資本建造長江沿岸工業化的時候，則「亞洲人的亞洲」這句話，方能有真正的意義。</p>
<p>如想到僅僅四千萬的日本人，甚至自從明治維新以來曾發揮巨大生產力，那末擁有多至四萬萬的人民，以及這條長江所有的這樣巨大自然力之中國，完成民族革命後，將在亞洲產生如何偉大的生產力，而是推想可知的。</p>
<p>像巨人鼾聲大起地睡着一樣，靜靜地，然而有力地在流着的這條長江，在我面前，不能不使我繼續不斷地連想這些事情。（完）魯譯</p>
<p>廣昇祥襪廠小史　人禾</p>
<p>廣昇祥襪廠，爲著名針織專家及大企業家余穉敬先生之祖父乾初公手創，始於遜清咸豐七年，初期開設於四馬路棋盤街，斯時洋貨尚未大宗進口，各地均以廣貨爲重，凡大江南北無不以該號爲採辦之總樞，迨至遜清光緒　三年，乃　移三馬路河南路西首，繼續營業，斯時余君乃兄幼裴公，有鑒於國勢之危殆，非提倡工業不足以救國，遂在粵發明絲光線襪之製造，及創染各種新穎顏色，行銷於港澳兩地，求者若渴，當時該號經理張劭棠君，　將大批絲光襪運滬銷售，極鼓吹之能事，門市店面，稱襪廠者，實以此爲嚆矢，後因營業發達，陸續增設聯號多家，如南洋襪廠，大東機廠，勤與紡織襪衫廠等，即市人稱爲六合公司者，亦即市上最負盛名之輪船牌，黑貓牌，水晶牌，　波牌，各絲線襪，無不由該號一手創銷。余君年來鑒於環境需求，更作進一步之擴展，爰將該號　移於南京路石路西首最繁盛之區，聞最近已裝修工竣，定於本月十六日開幕，屆時車水馬龍，必有一番盛況，又聞該號現由余　敬君任總監督之職，總經理則仍爲任職卅餘年之張劭棠君，副總經理則爲余君之姪余衍基君，經理則爲梁元敬君云。</p>

<h3>由助學而想到開源</h3>
<p>— 張詩洲</p>
<p>離開分一個新學期的更始，又祗有轉瞬即屆的二個月了。下學期的助學金還沒有確切的着落，　敎人耽憂。上屆的數千申繳助學生此次能否不受物價波動的影響而繼續得以逍求深遣，就得　此次經申報不斷呼　後的上海社會是否繼續維繋他們對於未來中國的關切心了！</p>
<p>茲將助學金開源新方策一一開列於後，幸祈讀者諸君及廣大的智識階　不吝珠玉腸敎正之爲幸。</p>
<p>（一）免費學額　全市股富鉅商及有力公司行號，每屆年終結算時，應於鉅額收入項下提出若干資金直接繳於學校，以容納個人所讚許的及學校所推薦的可造之材，以後經常地維持他們每學期的學費直到他們畢業爲止，最好還能組織一個委員會專司其事，俾能收事半功倍之效，邇個風尙如果蔚成，無數正將被埋沒的驚才，無疑地即可乘此機會重新抬起頭來，經過　磨之後，便可爲國致用，特殊專門人才的大量養成實利賴焉</p>
<p>（二）提成助學　全滬各大公司行號每天零售貨額及交易資金之鉅，至可驚人，如能自動普遍舉行提成助學，或特選一天代徵助學附捐，成績必至爲可觀，助金提成百分率　一％至十％不等概由自定，多多益善，助學附捐概由顧客自願，數額最好祗收一厘，由　員義務徵詢，顧客以金額既微，且本於爲善最樂之旨，自必大都應命，積少而成多，集腋可成裘，數千萬元鉅欵何患不立地而就哉。每當顧客銀貨兩訖之後，　員應給以特別印就並有公正團體蓋章之兩聯單收據（一聯存店備業繳捐欵之用），此後一俟積有成數滿一千元者，應立即解繳申報館或其他指定代收機關，以清手續。願全市工商傾袖中之先知先覺者能爲衆表率，立即率先起而作一個行導，則必能收一呼百應之效</p>
<p>（三）處　罰欵　最近當局又行四次　節水電，計照原有限度再減五成，受罰用戶勢必大量增加，可無疑義，罰金數額想不在小，望華中水電及法商水電兩公司能本收諸社會歸諸大衆之旨，將增收罰欵提成或全部捐充助學金，則誠不愧益賢明適當的措　，大衆過去綢於以上兩公司的種種誤會和非議亦可借此而消釋於無形矣。千萬的清寒優秀學子正等待着讃者諸君的扶助，望全市的有力有　份子能一致起來作廣泛的響應，不單保持現有的成績便算滿足，則我國的國運，便可因文盲的減少，而在不久的將來，欣然地轉向更光榮更燦爛的大道上前進了</p>
<p>實行「半日上課制」之困難　祚祈</p>
<p>十一月三十日國民論壇載有「空製時與節電後之學校上課問題」一文，提議節電後學校採用半日上課制，其中曰「…全市各校一律採用半日上課制，上午八時起，至一時止，…一律履行早操，…」。筆者略有管見，申述於后：</p>
<p>（一）上課時間若自上午八時起（如厲行早操，七時四十分必需到校），學生至遲于六時半前起身，此時天尙未明，勢必增加學生家庭內的開燈時間，與節電相矛盾。</p>
<p>（二）全市各校若一律採用半日上課制，則原光上下午均有兼課之敎師，如何辦法？如放棄一部份兼課，則生活本巳堪　之敎師又將如何生活？</p>
<p>（三）因房屋難覓，校舍不敷，本巳分上下午上課者（如市立育才格致兩中學，一讀上午，一讀下午；清心女子中小學校，中學部讀上午，小學部讀下午），如何實行此制？</p>
<p>（四）年幼學生自上午七時進點後，需至午後一時半許方能進午餐，於健康有妨。</p>
<p>實行半日上課制之困難有如上述，故於確實實行之前，上述數點，有加以考慮之必要。</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Attack and Air Force War Results in the Bapa Sea: Seven Enemy Destroyers and Transport Ships Sunk and Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:10 PM on the 13th: Sections of the Japanese Special Attack Units Ishicho, Hachiko, and Danshin Flight Squadrons, along with other flight squadrons, attacked the enemy transport convoy in the Bapa Sea off the west coast of Leyte on December 12th, achieving the following results: two transport ships and three destroyers were bombed and sunk; one transport ship and one destroyer were bombed, destroyed, and set ablaze.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy landed near Alvera on Leyte Island, Japanese special attack units and the air force have been launching daily attacks, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy's transport convoys, which are urgently trying to strengthen supplies. A section of the Japanese Special Attack Units Ishicho, Hachiko, and Danshin Squadrons also searched for and attacked a powerful enemy convoy off the west coast of Leyte on the 12th, breaking into its center. All of their aircraft successfully struck the enemy convoy, achieving great results and causing the enemy to tremble. In the above battles, some Japanese special attack units and other aircraft did not return after self-detonation. However, it seems that the Japanese aircraft that did not return this time also rammed enemy ships at the same time as the special attack units, perishing together. Being on the front line, whether or not they are special attack units, they should carry out ramming operations with the spirit of special attack units, so that the enemy's material strength can be completely destroyed. As for the names of the Ichiu, Hachiko, Yasukuni, Ishicho, and Danshin air squadrons and the results they achieved, they have also been explained separately in the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 13th. The Ichiu Squadron attacked Ormoc Bay on the 7th, sinking two enemy ships of unknown type. The Hachiko and Yasukuni Squadrons carried out ramming attacks on enemy ships. From this, it can be seen that the results of the Japanese air force's shelling and destruction of three large enemy transport ships and the sinking of ten enemy landing craft must include the results of the Yasukuni and Hachiko Squadrons. In addition, the Ishicho Squadron also bombed enemy convoys in Ormoc Bay and Camotes Sea on the 8th. Japanese escort fighters also encountered enemy aircraft, leading to fierce air battles, but the results have not yet been confirmed. However, at a minimum, they have hit enemy ships and inflicted some damage. The results achieved by the six aircraft of the Danshin Squadron were also considerable, including the sinking of two large enemy transport ships, one cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft; and the destruction of one large enemy transport ship and one cruiser or large destroyer, totaling seven ships.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine front, 13th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force bombed the west coast of Biliran Island, north of Leyte, on the afternoon of the 10th, destroying two enemy sailboats.</p>
<h3>Aichi and Shizuoka Raids Yesterday, Investigation of Interception War Results Underway. Enemy Aircraft Also Invade Tokyo and Shikoku Areas</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 13th: (1) About eighty enemy B29-type aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked the vicinity of Tokyo and the Shikoku region in small formations on the afternoon of the 13th, and mainly targeted the Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures. The results of the interception are currently under investigation. (2) Although the Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures suffered some damage, other areas had no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Enemy B29-type aircraft from the Mariana base have recently launched sporadic raids on the vicinity of Tokyo with small squadrons, while a few aircraft scouted the Hokkaido region. On the 13th, about eighty enemy aircraft attacked, bombing the factory areas of Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures, dropping both bombs and incendiary bombs. On the same day, one enemy aircraft flew from the southwest end of Izu Peninsula towards the Shikoku region, and three others circled near Tokyo to carry out containment operations. The main force attacked and bombed Aichi and Shizuoka prefectures. The Japanese air control units, along with military officers and civilians, fought hard to defend, and the damage was minimal. The enemy aircraft that attacked Tokyo and the Shikoku region did not drop a single bomb and immediately retreated, so there was no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - At 1:30 PM on the 13th, about forty enemy B29-type aircraft, each in formations of several, attacked the central region of Japan, namely the Nagoya and Hamamatsu areas, dropping several bombs in various locations. The Japanese military immediately launched an interception, and it seems that great results have been achieved. A detailed investigation is currently underway, but the damage suffered is extremely minor. At the same time, one or two enemy aircraft also invaded western Korea and the Gyeongseong-Hansong area. However, because the Japanese interception system in various places was unusually strict, the enemy aircraft fled in a panic.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Assault War Results in Morotai Island</h3>
<p>Southern Front Base, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army assault team on Morotai Island, responding to the air force's attack on the enemy airport and surrounding defense forces, landed on October 16th. From that night until December 6th, they killed or wounded 295 enemy soldiers (including 40 pilots), destroyed ten tents and one machine gun. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Burmese Japanese Aircraft Squadrons Sink Enemy Boats</h3>

<p>Hankou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Hankou City suffered indiscriminate bombing by Yu-Mei enemy aircraft a few days ago, resulting in innocent civilians suffering unexpected disasters and a tragic situation. Allied military authorities stationed in Hankou.

<h3>Fraser in Australia Discussing Operational Matters</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Canberra: Admiral Fraser, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, arrived here yesterday from San Francisco and met with Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for the Army Forde, Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions Makin, to discuss operational matters. Although Britain has promoted that the new Pacific Fleet will realize the agreement of joint British-American operations, the United States does not seem to have much expectation for this. According to a recent Associated Press report from New York, the newly established British Pacific Fleet is merely a rebranding of the Eastern Fleet, and it will be difficult to realize the cooperation between the British and American navies in the Pacific theater.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Authorities Crack Down on Anti-War Books</h3>
<p>Guangdong, 13th (Central News Agency) - Due to the changes in the war situation, the Chongqing authorities have exhausted various methods to prevent public sentiment from wavering and to promote the will to fight since this spring. According to a cultural figure who recently returned from the anti-Japanese war area, the pressure on cultural figures in Chongqing has become increasingly severe since this spring, and special attention is paid to publications. The Southwest Executive Department of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee has established the Southwest Publications Review Committee to review all publications. According to recent statistics, among the thousands of domestic and foreign books on politics, economics, society, and culture, about 60% promote communist ideology. The Chongqing authorities believe that such leftist books are a manifestation of anti-war thought and have begun to ban them. Among the main books in this category are Gorky's "French Revolution and Class Struggle," as well as political and economic commentaries on various countries, and the works of first-class writers such as Lu Xun, Hu Shi, Guo Moruo, and Tian Han, most of which are prohibited.</p>

<h3>Saving and Storing Materials</h3>
<p>For four years, this newspaper has been receiving enthusiastic support and generous donations from readers to help students. The number of students subsidized in each session has increased from 1,005 to 4,658, and the amount of aid disbursed has increased from over 30,000 yuan to over 14 million yuan. The average aid received per person has increased from 33 yuan to 3,047 yuan. These figures not only demonstrate the spirit of philanthropy, mutual assistance, and cooperation among readers, but also prove that the belief in saving the country through education has deeply rooted itself in people's hearts. In this extraordinary period, everyone especially feels that the level of the people must be raised, various talents must be cultivated, and the studies of young people must not be allowed to be suspended or interrupted!</p>
<p>Now, the fundraising campaign for the eighth session of aid is underway. Due to the rapid increase in commodity prices, tuition fees for each school next semester will probably be at least double what they were this semester. We estimate that we need to raise at least 30 million yuan in aid to barely maintain the studies of the original 4,000-plus students receiving aid. If the increase in tuition fees exceeds double, and if we plan to expand the scope of subsidies and recruit new students in addition to the original students receiving aid, this amount will certainly not be enough.</p>
<p>At first glance, 30 million yuan is a large number. Currently, the aid deposit is less than 10 million yuan, so we need to raise more than 20 million yuan in the shortest possible time, which does not seem easy. However, based on past experience, we believe that this goal is not difficult to achieve, and it is not difficult to exceed. The aid issued in the first session was only over 30,000 yuan, the second session increased to over 50,000 yuan, the third session increased to 140,000 yuan, the fourth session increased to 230,000 yuan, the fifth session increased to 1.38 million yuan, the sixth session increased to 3.25 million yuan, and the seventh session increased to 14.19 million yuan. Since it was possible to increase by more than 400 times from the first session to the seventh session, it can be said that it will inevitably increase by another two or three times from the seventh session to the eighth session.</p>
<p>Now, prices are soaring and life is difficult. This situation, on the one hand, certainly makes it impossible for many parents to afford their children's tuition fees, but on the other hand, it may not necessarily reduce the public's enthusiasm for helping students. Because the interest rates on all investments have been generous recently, although there are many poor people, the overall wealth of society may not be low. On the contrary, we believe that there are now more people who can donate 100,000 or 80,000 than there were people who could donate 100 or 200 before the war. For those who have the ability, donating tens of thousands of yuan now is easier than donating dozens of yuan before the war.</p>
<p>Dear readers, think about it: How many places in the whole country—the whole world—can still be as comfortable and free to live in as Shanghai? How many families are not displaced, with their families broken and dead? How many people are not struggling, destitute, and hungry? When you think of these situations, how can you not feel that being able to live in peace and have enough to eat is already extremely fortunate? How can you have the heart to waste unnecessary money and exchange it for excessive material enjoyment? How can you have the heart not to work hard to save money, contribute to good deeds, and create happiness for your children and grandchildren and for the benefit of the people?</p>
<p>Now, as long as you have the intention to save money, you can save a considerable amount anytime, anywhere. Reducing one banquet, eating one less snack, watching one less show, or even taking one less rickshaw or pedicab ride is a way to help poor students avoid dropping out of school. Those who have the ability can save more and donate more, which is of course the best. Those who have less ability may as well save less and donate less. Accumulating small amounts into large amounts is also the same way to benefit society and benefit the people!</p>
<p>Saving and storing materials is the most meaningful work and also the most urgent work. This newspaper respectfully asks readers to do their best!</p>
<h3>Political Training Offices Established in Provinces and Cities, Directors Appointed by Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Since the government authorities convened the National Military and Political Conference at the end of last month, they have placed great emphasis on the unification of military and political affairs throughout the country. The Military Affairs Commission is actively strengthening political training work to ensure close ties between military units throughout the country and local governments.

<h3>Reminiscences of the Naval Air Battle off the Eastern Coast of Taiwan</h3>
<p>— Shunji</p>
<p>This time, the enemy American forces, boasting of their most outstanding mobile units, attempted to realize their counter-offensive operation plan in the Pacific. Since the beginning of October, it can be divided into three battle phases: first, the naval air battle off the eastern coast of Taiwan; second, the naval battle off the eastern coast of the Philippines; and third, the defense of Leyte Island. In the Taiwan-Philippines naval battles, the enemy American mobile units lost most of their strength, and the landing forces on Leyte Island are also being encircled and annihilated.</p>
<p>Regarding the course of the Taiwan-Philippines battles, news reports have already been made. Now, I will summarize the news from Tokyo and trace the events in order to clarify the general situation of the war:</p>
<p>The Target is Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>Since the beginning of October, the signs of the enemy mobile units' movements in the Mariana Islands area had already been detected by the Japanese side, and it was also expected that they would invade the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan as a prelude to the capture of the Philippines. Then, on the morning of the 10th, the enemy mobile units did appear in the Ryukyu Islands, launching air raids on Okinawa with carrier-based aircraft. At that time, the Japanese Navy, for the sake of caution, waited quietly, waiting for the enemy aircraft that had returned to base at dusk. According to the reports of the reconnaissance personnel, no enemy shadows had been found in their patrol area. At this time, other search planes were still continuing their search. At 3:00 AM on the 11th, the Japanese search planes finally captured the American mobile units on the dark ocean with radio wave weapons, slowly approaching them. Judging from their actions, the American mobile units clearly had the intention of leaving the Ryukyu Islands and heading south. After dawn on the 11th, the vigilance in the patrol areas became even stricter, and the American mobile units' intention to head south became even more certain. Therefore, the Japanese army had no choice but to immediately launch an offensive and begin the pursuit. Preparations for the attack were quickly completed.</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM on the 12th, a search plane detected that the American mobile units, divided into four groups, were operating in the east of Taiwan. On the same morning, Taiwan issued an air raid alert.</p>
<p>Was this mobile unit the one that invaded the Ryukyu Islands on the 10th and then reappeared in Taiwan? Or was it another one? Let's not worry about that for now. What matters is that they intended to temporarily settle in Taiwan and carry out a large-scale air raid on Taiwan, which was undoubtedly true. The long-awaited opportunity finally came, and a detailed attack plan was immediately drawn up. At this time, air raid alerts were issued in the Ryukyu Islands area, including Miyakojima, Ishigakijima, and Amami Oshima.</p>
<p>The base, which had been waiting for a long time, suddenly became tense. On the airfield, various elite aircraft were ready to take off, and a short and capable commander gave instructions to his subordinates, who were determined to die to repay the country:</p>
<p>"The target is aircraft carriers, especially fire-type aircraft carriers. As long as we thoroughly strike the aircraft carriers, I believe that Japan will definitely win. I hope everyone will fight to the end in order to destroy the enemy army, and I wish you all success."</p>
<p>Discovering the Wheel Formation of Aircraft Carriers</p>
<p>After the attack squadrons departed, in the dim electric light of the combat command post, Commander Colonel Hisano and all the staff maintained their silence, waiting quietly for the good news from the front. Before long, the routine report from the search planes that had captured the enemy mobile units arrived. Everyone's foreheads lit up. The search planes had already discovered three of the four groups of enemy mobile units and were concentrating on discovering the remaining group. Then, reports of the attack squadrons making contact with the enemy also arrived. The battle had begun! After that, good news kept pouring in, and the first attack was successful.</p>
<p>The night of the 12th was a moonless black night. Near the battlefield, affected by the seasonal winds, thick clouds gathered and rain began to fall at night. The weather was extremely bad, and visibility was extremely poor. This was not suitable for a night attack, but the Japanese air force, which had undergone rigorous training, took advantage of this weather to capture the wheel formation of the American fleet, which possessed large aircraft carriers, on the dark ocean. Among the attack teams that night was Petty Officer T from Yamaguchi Prefecture, who had participated in the naval battle off the coast of Malaya and sunk the British battleship Repulse.</p>
<p>At this time, the rain had stopped and the sky had cleared. Petty Officer I, using the faint starlight, reduced altitude and carefully searched for traces of the enemy. Before long, he made contact with the outer perimeter of the wheel formation. The enemy's defensive fire was very intense. At the same time, six night fighters flew to challenge him. Petty Officer I, while dealing with the intercepting enemy aircraft, changed course and charged forward. However, because he discovered that the target was not an aircraft carrier, but a battleship or cruiser, he changed the torpedo attack course again and finally found a large aircraft carrier, immediately dropping a torpedo. Before long, with a loud bang, a high column of water rose from the sea, and the enemy ship spewed out a raging tongue of fire. The torpedo hit the ship's hull one-third of the way from the bow. Several minutes later, this aircraft carrier sank to the bottom of the sea. At this time, a certain captain also fired a torpedo at an enemy ship. Unfortunately, the plane he was piloting was hit in the fuel tank by enemy fire. He then turned his fiery plane around and crashed into the enemy aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>In this way, in the night attack on the 12th, a total of four aircraft carriers were sunk, one aircraft carrier was destroyed, and the type of eleven ships was unknown. Some Japanese aircraft also did not return. Some of them, like a certain captain, bravely self-detonated, while others could not return to base due to mechanical failure and fuel exhaustion.</p>
<p>Incomparably Brave Kamikaze</p>
<p>By the 13th, the situation was slightly different. From the night of the 12th to 00:00 on the 13th, according to the reconnaissance of the search planes, the American mobile units were divided into several groups and continued to move restlessly in the east of Taiwan. Their intention was, of course, to attempt to raid Taiwan again. After receiving considerable blows on the night of the 12th, they had transferred more than twenty aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships from the rear, intending to rely on quantity to reverse the downward trend.</p>
<p>The attack on this day, like the previous day, also concentrated its efforts on attacking aircraft carriers. Search planes and attack planes departed in turn. Near the battlefield, the situation was the same as on the 12th, with the clouds divided into upper and lower layers, and heavy rain was falling below. This situation was very favorable for the attacking side. Passing through the dark clouds, the enemy fleet could be faintly seen lined up in a single column. They had probably learned from the misfortune of the previous day and changed from a scattered formation to a dense formation. The commander's plane, piloted by Navy Lieutenant Commander Nagai, first charged towards a large aircraft carrier, dropping a sure-hit giant bomb, and crashed into it heroically, person and plane together. Subsequently, the other planes, seeing the captain's courageous behavior, were even more excited and rushed madly towards their respective targets. As a result, three aircraft carriers and one cruiser or destroyer were sunk. In addition, one aircraft carrier, one battleship, and one cruiser were destroyed.</p>
<p>The Enemy Fleet Couldn't Withstand the Pressure and Collapsed</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, summarizing the information from various sources, the American fleet, which was originally divided into four groups, had been fatally struck on the 12th and 13th and had reorganized its remnants, shrinking to two groups. Moreover, it was no longer as high-spirited as before, and many of them were injured. Early on this day, enemy carrier-based aircraft again launched air raids on various parts of Taiwan, but the number of aircraft had been reduced significantly. The American mobile units were clearly covering their retreat, so the Japanese army's pursuit battle immediately began. At this time, the army's torpedo bomber squadron also participated in the pursuit, as well as other units. On this day, after the daytime raid, in the evening, the army and navy units cooperated even more closely and launched a night attack. As a result, three aircraft carriers, two battleships, and three cruisers were bombed and sunk, and two aircraft carriers and two cruisers were destroyed. In addition, one destroyer was heavily damaged, and the type of two ships was unknown. Moreover, five enemy ships were hit and caught fire.</p>
<p>In this way, the American mobile units suffered great damage due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese army in three days, and fled south in a hurry, in a miserable state. (Sent from Kyoto)</p>

<h3>Tokyo-Singapore Railway to be Fully Open Within a Year; Material Exchange Will Be Smoother</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - The North and South Japanese armies in the Guangxi Province finally joined forces at Suilu, about 70 kilometers southwest of Nanning, on the 10th of this month. Therefore, the continental longitudinal road has been opened, and the (Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Express) train from Tokyo to Singapore or Yangon will probably be realized soon. Naturally, those from Singapore, Yangon, or other places to Tokyo will also be realized at the same time. This main line of the continental longitudinal railway will also be realized at the same time. This main line of the continental longitudinal railway starts from Tokyo, passes through Busan, Fengtian, Beijing, and then goes to Hankou via the Beijing-Hankou Railway, turns to the Yuehan Railway and passes through Chongyang, Liuzhou, Nanning, Zhennanguan, enters Vietnam, and passes through Hanoi, Tana Pu, and Bangkok to Singapore. If going to Yangon, a special train can be taken from Bangkok. It is estimated that it is 10,878 li from Tokyo to Singapore, and it can be reached in 9 days and 11 hours. In addition, another route is from Tokyo to Nagasaki, by sea to Shanghai, passing through Hangzhou, Jinhua, Nanchang, and Zhuzhou, and then connecting with the previous route. This route is 5,500 kilometers from Shanghai to Singapore, and it only takes 4 days and 23 hours from Tokyo to Singapore. The distance of the unfinished parts of the route is only 840 kilometers in total, and if construction is carried out, it can be completed in just one year. If Tokyo and Singapore operate once a day, 40 to 50 million tons of materials and 150,000 passengers can be transported in one year. In addition, after the entire line is open, the development of coal and iron newly produced in China, tin fluorite produced in Malaya, etc. can be started. The agricultural products of various places can also be greatly increased. At the same time, good results can be obtained in the exchange of materials, as well as in military, political, and economic terms.</p>
<p>South China Front, 13th (Central News Agency) - Nanning is the last stronghold of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Guangxi Province. After the Japanese army occupied the area, they continued to attack the 65th, 56th, and 159th armies, which fled from Guilin and Liuzhou to the mountainous area northwest of Nanning, attempting to recapture Nanning. The Japanese army advanced fiercely, seeking to easily establish contact with the Japanese Annam Expeditionary Force attacking Guangxi from Annam. This unit occupied Lixu (80 kilometers northwest of Nanning) and Pozhaoxu (90 kilometers northwest of Nanning) on November 29, and Guode (100 kilometers northwest of Nanning) on the 30th. At the same time, a unit of the Japanese army advanced rapidly southwest from the south bank of Lishui. On the 10th of this month, it finally succeeded in contacting the expeditionary force, that is, the Japanese Annam Expeditionary Force. At the same time, the great cause of the continental longitudinal road was also completely successful.</p>
<p>Singapore, 13th (Nanjing Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in South China and the Japanese army in Vietnam joined forces at Suilu on the 10th, and the longitudinal route between Tokyo and Singapore was thus opened. In view of the good news, Mr. Naito, the Special Mayor of Singapore, made the following statement on the 12th: This great undertaking makes it possible to realize direct railway connection between Tokyo and Singapore, which has a great impact on Singapore. At present, there are only 840 kilometers of railway that have not been opened, and the project is said to be completed within one year. Therefore, Tokyo, the center of Greater East Asia, and Singapore, the center of the southern region, can be directly connected. In addition, telecommunications and telephones between Tokyo and Singapore can be connected by using existing electric wires. Now the Japanese military strength has been greatly strengthened, and the day of completing the victory of the war is coming soon. On the one hand, the opening of the longitudinal route will enable closer contact between Japan, Manchuria, the Republic of China, Vietnam, Thailand, Burma, the Provisional Government of Free India, and Malaya. Greater East Asia will be closer, and the concept of Asian unity has been concretely manifested. Therefore, Singapore's mission is even greater.</p>

<h3>Great Naval Battle in the Taiwan-Philippines Waters; Japanese Army Occupies Absolute Advantage; Summary of Minister Matsushima's Speech</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Association held a ceremony on the 12th to commemorate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Minister Matsushima said in his speech: Now that the Greater East Asia War has entered its fourth year, China and Japan should work together more closely to prevent the British and Americans from invading China, so as to destroy the enemy's ambition. Japan is now launching a major decisive battle with the enemy, with the Philippines as the center. I will briefly describe the recent battle situation to you.</p>
<p>As the enemy's US leaders have repeatedly said in the past, the enemy's ambition is to retake the Philippine Islands and land on the Chinese coast to launch a final decisive battle with Japan. Due to the difficulties of the European war situation and the domestic situation in the United States, the United States is increasingly deeply concerned about this move. According to enemy propaganda, the 200,000 troops led by MacArthur advanced from New Guinea, and were supported by the full strength of the Pacific Fleet led by Nimitz. It is a large unit based on at least a dozen battleships and about 60 aircraft carriers. The United States divided this into</p>
<p>North and South armies. The North Army was led by Halsey, commander of the Third Fleet, and the South Army was led by Spruance, commander of the Fifth Fleet. They began attacking the Palau and Monete Islands on September 15, opening the prelude to the war. The enemy army achieved slight gains on Monete Island, but suffered great damage in Palau due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese army and navy, and was in a dilemma. Anxious, the enemy army decided to land on the Philippine Islands in one fell swoop, and used Halsey's Third Fleet to bomb Okinawa and Taiwan from October 10 in an attempt to cut off the supply line between mainland Japan and the Philippine Islands. Thus, the decisive battle began, and the long-awaited Japanese Combined Fleet resolutely rose up. The enemy had more than 1,000 aircraft attacking the entire island of Taiwan around October 11. That midnight, the Japanese Combined Fleet Air Force and the Army Air Force cooperated to intercept the enemy aircraft on the sea east of Taiwan. By the 14th, the Third Fleet had been annihilated. The United States is extremely secretive about its damage and does not disclose it. However, the extent of the damage to the United States is</p>
<p>easy to imagine. In November, Mitscher, commander of the 58th Mobile Task Force, the elite of the U.S. Third Fleet, said after escaping back to San Diego military port that it was impossible to achieve results quickly today, when the U.S. supply line has been extended. This prompted the U.S. Fifth Fleet to move north quickly to take in friendly forces retreating from the north, and the elite of the Japanese Naval and Air Force aviation units in the Philippines, which constantly bombarded the Philippines in the Luzon area, continued to be active in this new battlefield, braving the bad weather. However, taking advantage of this gap, the enemy used three divisions of troops to land on Leyte Island from October 19 to 20. The main purpose was to cut off the connection between Luzon and Mindanao, and then to the South China Sea. The surface fleet of the Japanese Combined Fleet resolutely rose up at this moment. The Japanese elite fleet suddenly appeared on the sea east of Samar Island on the morning of October 25, first attacking the enemy's powerful mobile unit and inflicting heavy damage on it. On the 26th, part of the Japanese fleet broke into the enemy transport fleet and battleships anchored in Leyte Gulf, and heavily damaged the enemy ships. Since the</p>
<p>Taiwan waters. Since the naval battle, the total losses of the enemy fleet have been sunk or destroyed. Up to more than 40 battleships, more than 50 aircraft carriers, and more than 200 other large and small ships, as well as more than 1,000 aircraft. This naval battle may be one of the largest naval battles in the Greater East Asia War. We can gain five impressions from this: (1) The strength of the Japanese Navy has occupied an absolute advantage. (2) The defensive power of the U.S. fleet is extremely weak. (3) Japan's strategy and tactics were unexpected to the enemy and the United States, and it took advantage of the situation. The "rush-in tactics" in Leyte Gulf were especially ingenious. (4) The close cooperation between the Japanese army and navy, and the loyal and brave actions of the generals and soldiers, have established an invincible posture. (5) The longer the enemy's supply line, the more difficulties it has. In addition, the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the Army Special Attack Corps bravely crashed into enemy ships, and achieved sure-hit and sure-win results. This kind of act of martyrdom is a unique tactic of Japan, which is difficult for the enemy and the United States to imitate, and is especially admired by the world. Because of this practice of sacrificing one's life for righteousness, the enemy took the opportunity to send a transport fleet to invade from the south in order to resupply Leyte Island, and reorganized the defeated ships into</p>
<p>mobile units. From the beginning of November to the middle of the month, it began to operate on the sea east of Luzon in an attempt to reverse the defeat. However, each time it was attacked by the Japanese air force and submarine fleet, and suffered great damage. As for the Japanese army units on land on Leyte Island, they continued to attack the enemy fiercely in bad weather, and gradually gained the support of powerful rear units. As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters the other day, the Japanese parachute troops and airborne troops have resolutely landed at enemy airports, and are still suppressing the enemy with "rush-in tactics". Now the enemy has repeatedly broadcast the difficulties of the Leyte Island battle. On or around December 5, the enemy sent a transport fleet consisting of 78 ships to invade Camotes Bay through the Surigao Strait south of Leyte. The Japanese air force, with the assistance of the special attack teams of the army and navy, bravely intercepted and inflicted heavy damage. However, part of the enemy's forces seems to have landed on a corner of the southwest coast of Leyte Island. Observing the enemy's goal, it is the key point of Ormoc on the west coast. However, the Japanese army and navy have seized the good opportunity to annihilate the enemy and are now working hard. The enemy's landing on Leyte Island has actually launched a major decisive battle between Japan and the United States. After repeated defeats, the enemy is trying to use long-range bombing B29 aircraft to bomb Japanese mainland Manchuria and North China industrial areas as the only means to attack Japanese industries. However, the important industries of Japan have not been damaged at all. The war has now entered its fourth year. China and Japan should implement the true meaning of sharing life and death to save the entire destiny of Greater East Asia. It is also at this time that the United States' tyranny against Chongqing has reached its extreme, such as the recent change of the top leadership of the Chongqing government due to Roosevelt's recall of Stilwell. In addition, the Nelson faction is planning to manage China after the war and trample on Greater East Asia in the name of saving the war situation. The enemy is dispatching enemy aircraft to carry out major activities in order to open up the Ledo Road and try to reverse the decline, but the Japanese army's ambitious operations have crushed the enemy's attempt and attacked and occupied Liuzhou, Guilin, Nanning, and other places, and gradually blocked the activities of the enemy's air force. To this day, the Pacific and the Chinese mainland have become the decisive battlefields for destroying the British and Americans. What we should devote our greatest efforts to is to prevent the British and American armies from invading China. The enemy has suffered great difficulties in resources and manpower, and is mobilizing all its forces to invade China in an attempt to make the entire Chinese territory</p>
<p>fall into the battlefield. We know the fate of Italy today. If the entire Chinese territory falls into the battlefield, it will not only be the misfortune of the Chinese people, but also the misfortune of the entire Greater East Asia. Therefore, we should endure any sacrifices and strive to prevent this from happening. The decisive battle in the Philippine Islands can also be said to be a war to defend China. Secondly, in Europe, although Germany is surrounded by enemies on all sides, it is still fighting hard. Since entering December, the enemy's offensive has become more fierce. It is believed that after the completion of Germany's national mobilization, the German army's morale will be able to inflict a major blow on the enemy. The enemy has repeatedly proclaimed that after the European war situation has made progress, the British and Americans will be able to move their army, navy, and air force from Europe to the Pacific. Now it seems that they want to move part of their forces, but due to the complexity of the British-American relations, it is feared that the movement of their forces will not be as ideal as they want. Also, the movements of the British fleet in India and Ceylon are now being taken very seriously, but the Japanese army has prepared everything and is determined to destroy them. Now the whole world has entered a whirlpool. How to develop the fate of Greater East Asia is an important task that the people of China and Japan will shoulder in the future. I am one of the representatives of Japan. I am fully aware of the past history of China and Japan and the shortcomings between each other, but today is not the time to talk about such historical facts.</p>
<p>The realization of comprehensive peace between China and Japan and the expulsion of British and American forces are the most important issues at present. Therefore, we should inherit Mr. Wang's will and complete Mr. Sun's great nation-building cause. Recently, I visited Mrs. Umeya in Shanghai. The Umeya family had taken care of Mr. Chiang in many ways. When I talked with Mrs. Umeya about the past and saw photos of Mr. Sun, Mr. Chiang, and the current Chongqing generals studying in Japan, I was deeply moved. The soldier I respect the most is Mr. He Yingqin. Mr. He's heroic posture is still in my commemorative album. Also, I saw the wedding photo of Mr. Chiang and Soong Mei-ling at Mrs. Umeya's house. China and Japan were full of such human feelings in the past. Why is there today's conflict? I deeply hope that the dear gentlemen in Chongqing will compare the recent policies of the United States with Japan's new policies.</p>
<p>Please consider carefully. Japan today already has an invincible war result posture and is fighting against the British and Americans. In the fourth year of the war, Japan's only hope is to expand the results of the war and complete the foundation of the great cause. Chinese youths have the heavy responsibility of solving China's destiny and building Greater East Asia in the current great transformation of the world. Today, it is not difficult for China to exist independently from the international situation. China must complete the great cause of nation-building in the international situation and become the center of Greater East Asia. Mr. Wang and Mr. Touyama Mitsuru, who died before and after, were Japanese elders who realized Sino-Japanese friendship. I am willing to inherit Mr. Touyama Mitsuru's will and work with you to complete the great cause with Asia. Finally, I hope that Chinese youths will overcome any difficulties and bravely move forward towards a bright future.</p>

<h3>Electricity to be Supplied to Military, Civilian, and Industrial Factories in Advance; Economic Bureau Agrees with Central China Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>It has been found that the amount of electricity used for production by various factories in the city was previously determined by the Municipal Economic Bureau, which issued a notice to all manufacturers, ordering them to register with the bureau before the end of October, so as to conduct a joint investigation with the Public Utility Bureau and Central China Water and Electricity Company, and to adjust the electricity supply according to the nature of the products, the amount of production, and the degree of urgency. Now that the deadline has passed for a month, the bureau has submitted its opinions on the findings of the investigation and has reached an agreement with Central China Water and Electricity and relevant authorities that electricity will be supplied in advance or the original amount of electricity will be restored to manufacturers of military and civilian daily necessities, so as to concentrate production. This measure will soon be seen in fact. Therefore, manufacturers who have not yet registered but are indeed related to military and civilian needs should register with the fourth section of the bureau immediately, otherwise the line will be cut off.</p>
<h3>Economic Authorities Determined to Suppress and Stabilize Prices with Full Force; Allied Nations Willing to Assist</h3>
<p>After the city's economic police conducted a comprehensive inspection of various commodity prices, most immediately fell, and the rest remained stable. Recently, a group of cunning merchants, who had been lying dormant for a long time, began to spread rumors again in an attempt to revive their manipulative schemes, leading to a new wave of price increases for various goods. The city's Bureau of Economic Affairs, in order to implement its fundamental goal of suppressing and stabilizing prices, is currently paying close attention and has decided to continue taking strict measures with full force, without shying away from any difficulties, to achieve the purpose of balancing prices and ensuring the people's livelihood. It is also reported that the heads of various Allied agencies have expressed great concern about this and have indicated to the city government their willingness to provide full assistance. Furthermore, the Economic Security Office, facing a shortage of manpower due to the intensity of its work, is increasing the number of investigators in order to expand the scope of investigations, strengthen the organization, and severely crack down on those who hoard, manipulate, and arbitrarily raise prices.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the soaring prices of goods have seriously threatened the lives of ordinary citizens, who earnestly hope that the Bureau of Economic Affairs will keep its word and take effective and thorough measures to avoid repeating the past pattern of inconsistent enforcement, which would only drive the people's livelihood into a more desperate situation.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Reorganizes Baojia System, Adopts Lianbao System</h3>
<p>The Baojia system in the entire Nanshi area, after being ordered by the Baojia Office of the Municipal Police Headquarters to be reorganized by the Hunnan District Baojia Office, has decided to abolish the Fang Gongsuo system and adopt the Zonglian Baojia Zhang system. The candidates for the Zonglian Baozhang, Lianbaozhang, and Baozhang positions within the district have all been internally determined, and a list has been prepared. Yesterday, Gu Jiwu, the director of the Baojia Office, made a special trip to Nanshi to provide guidance on Baojia matters and established close cooperation with the Nanshi police sub-bureau. Once the final decision is made, the list of candidates for Lianbaozhang in the district will be officially announced.</p>
<h3>Youth League Dedicates Scrap Metal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Practice Committee of the China Youth Practice and Asia-Wide Struggle Movement has issued a notice to all schools in the city to promote the youth's scrap metal donation campaign. Since its launch, young people have enthusiastically donated, and the situation is good. Furthermore, in order to mobilize the city's youth to plant castor beans, the committee ordered youths in schools to begin planting in nearby designated areas today (the 14th), and the committee will send personnel to various places to inspect and provide guidance.</p>
<h3>This Period's Household Oil to Be Sold Regularly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai District Edible Oil Allocation Office of the Oil and Grain Control Association has scheduled to issue household cooking oil (soybean oil or raw rapeseed oil) to residents in the first district of the city and the newly merged Xihu district from the 16th to the 25th of this month. Citizens can purchase the oil at designated retail stores with the No. 32 Comprehensive Rationing Certificate. Each person is allocated four ounces, costing 70 National Currency units, which amounts to 280 National Currency units per city catty. The districts of Nanshi, Zhabei, the city center, Pudong, Xuhua Fang, and Longhua Town will have their allocation delayed by a few days before being issued.</p>

<h3>Please Mobilize Collective Donations from All Banks and Money Shops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we published a request for all sectors of society to sponsor the "Special Solicitation" with the power of "collective" contributions. We are very pleased that the Zhengwei Pharmacy colleagues were the first to respond and pledge to donate a team, which is truly commendable. Judging from the situation of team pledges and donations over the past fourteen days, it is truly disappointing! Our newspaper's budget estimates an average daily intake of 700,000 National Currency units, with a monthly intake of 20 million National Currency units. However, the current shortfall is significant, causing us great anxiety! In fact, we are not anxious for ourselves, but for the more than 4,000 impoverished students who are eagerly hoping for enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society, but the reality is not so, and it seems that people are adopting a "hands-off" attitude.</p>
<p>Today, we are making an urgent appeal to the banking and money industry, hoping that colleagues in the money shops will follow the method we set yesterday, mobilize the power of "collective" contributions, and implement team pledges. There are a total of five to six hundred banks and money shops in Shanghai, with at least two hundred having a long history and outstanding reputation. We only hope that these two hundred shops will come forward to support us first, with each shop forming a team of both labor and management, then there is a possibility of success for three to four hundred teams. The money shop industry is the mother of all industries, leading the financial sector and the guiding force of industry and commerce, and we trust they will express their sympathy.</p>
<p>Zhengwei Colleagues Collectively Sponsor</p>
<p>A letter from colleagues at Zhengwei Pharmacy on Jiujiang Road reads: "We, the undersigned, have friends who wish to celebrate Mr. Yu's 50th birthday. We are transferring the sum of 20,000 National Currency units originally intended for his birthday celebration to your newspaper's eighth National Reader Assistance Fund special solicitation team, as a response to the 'collective sponsorship.' Please list it under the name 'Celebrating Yu's Birthday Team' and issue a receipt."</p>
<p>Eighth Shenbao Reader Assistance Fund Special Solicitation Team</p>
<p>Twenty-Seventh Team: Wang Xianjun Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Twenty-Eighth Team: Ren Maoting Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Twenty-Ninth Team: Celebrating Yu's Birthday Team, donated 20,000 National Currency units. Total received: 60,000 National Currency units. Remaining balance: 1,440,000 National Currency units.</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to Mr. Wang Xianjun, Mr. Ren Maoting, and colleagues at Zhengwei Pharmacy for forming teams with the congratulatory gifts for Mr. Yu's birthday. If expenses on celebrations can be slightly reduced and transferred to student aid, it would benefit relatives and friends and have profound significance.</p>
<h3>Fresh Meat Supply Gradually Increases, Market Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, the market price of fresh meat in the city has soared. After repeated control by powerful authorities, the source of pigs has become very smooth, and purchasing merchants are also actively operating directly. Therefore, since yesterday, the price of fresh meat on the market has fallen from more than 400 National Currency units per city catty to 380 National Currency units. According to business people, there is a possibility of a further decline in the near future.</p>

<h3>Viewing Mr. and Mrs. Lang Jingshan's Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Le Tian</p>
<p>Mr. Lang Jingshan's photographic art is not only famous throughout the country, but also internationally renowned, so it needs no introduction. In recent days, at the invitation of the Xinwenbao and this newspaper, he has presented masterpieces and paintings by his wife, Lei 　Zhi, and daughter, Lang Yuxian, totaling 200 pieces, on display at the Daxin Painting Gallery. Among them, the ten most valuable pieces have been completely donated to the two newspapers to fund student loans, specifically to aid students specializing in agriculture and engineering. Mr. and Mrs. Lang's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter appreciated his works at the exhibition for two hours, which can be described as a feast for the eyes, with no regrets. Unfortunately, I have no in-depth study of photography, nor the skill to describe it in detail. According to my investigation, 60% of the displayed photographs have participated in international photography exhibitions. In particular, "Huanghai Qifeng" has been exhibited in international exhibitions more than 50 times, and was voted the most popular by the audience at an exhibition in India. "Fishing and Returning Without 　Boat" won a gold medal in Chicago. These two pieces have been included in the world's masterpieces.</p>
<p>The ten pieces that Lang donated to the Xinwenbao and this newspaper to fund student loans are titled "Qinglan Qingxiao," "Hongshu Qingshan Hao Fangchuan," "Qifeng Jiashu," "Yun Zheng Richu," "Fishing and Returning Without 　Boat," "Tijing Lan Yu," "Shancun Chu Jia," "Chicha Fengyun," "Puxian Statue," and "Haowai Yi." These ten pieces are priced at 50,000 yuan for competitive bidding. Enthusiastic 　-eyed individuals who purchase them will not only enjoy the fame of helping students, but also obtain masterpieces by famous artists, truly a rare and joyous event in life.</p>
<p>According to my amateur opinion, Lang's photographic techniques, in addition to composition, lighting, and layout, which are all superb, the most unique is the technique of "combination printing," which is difficult for ordinary photographers. What is "combination printing"? It is the method of using truncation and supplementation to add several good images to this unattractive image. Sometimes, an ordinary photograph is made into an extremely beautiful photograph through three or four "combination printing" methods. For example, in the piece "Dream," he initially photographed a lion, and the picture turned into three lions, with a naked beauty sleeping next to them. People who do not understand the "combination printing" method will be suspicious, thinking how can a beauty sleep naked next to three lions? This is all the use of "combination printing" techniques. According to Lang: "According to international practice, photography is not colored. This time, in order to express Eastern colors and cater to the tastes of the general public, most of them are colored, and I am grateful for the assistance of Mr. Chen Bingqin." "Combination printing" works are mostly unique and not reproduced. This time, Chen Yong 　, Ye Yuhu, Xia Jingguan, Wu Hufan, Qian Ya, Ma Gongyu, Huang Benxuan, and Chu 　 have inscribed poems, adding a lot of color. Today is the fifth day of the charity exhibition, which will close on the 20th. Gentlemen from all walks of life who wish to broaden their horizons, why not come!</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Wuhan (III)</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>The next day, I went to Wuchang in the morning to keep an appointment. On the return trip by boat, everyone was discussing the tragic bombing of the night before. Inadvertently, I began to listen carefully to the passengers' conversations. The great fire caused by the incendiary bombs last night was in the refugee area of Hankou. This area had never been bombed before. Therefore, as soon as the bombing of Hankou became intense, the residents of the former French Concession and the British Concession ran to the refugee area to take refuge. I had inspected the refugee area once two or three days ago. It was a place with narrow roads, dilapidated houses, and a dense population. Even if you wanted to dig air-raid shelters, there was no place to dig. Moreover, what the American planes 　did last night was to indiscriminately drop incendiary bombs without distinguishing military facilities. The houses of people who thought they were sitting pretty became mountains of flames in the blink of an eye. In a panic, they wanted to escape outwards, but they were squeezed back by people carrying things to escape, and they could only desperately roll into their vortex, rushing left and right.</p>
<p>Burnt wall fragments and collapsed bricks and tiles kept falling on their heads. There may still be living people under the collapsed houses, but no one has the strength to care about other people's lives. In an instant, the flames above, like raging waves overturning mountains and seas, swallowed up the people running for their lives, and the people were immediately burned like roasted pigs.</p>
<p>As soon as the ship I was on arrived at the shore, I immediately ran to the place where the fire was. There were still embers there, but some people had already returned home to sort out the remaining items in their homes, and some were helping to prop up the collapsed walls. There were also children looking for their father's body, and mothers who were crying because their babies had been burned to death. "Liu Kaibang," a fish restaurant famous for its pufferfish dishes in Hankou, was also burned to the ground, with not a single tile remaining. The king of braised fish, Liu Kaibang himself, was also burned to death in his own house. A famous tailor surnamed Zhou was left alone, and his whole family became burned ghosts. He himself had gone mad and was shouting everywhere in the city, "It's over, it's over." A famous lawyer 　 in Hankou was the opposite of Zhou the tailor. He died alone, while his family of eight was spared because they lived in the French Concession. When the family returned, the house was gone, and the family head they relied on was also gone. In one night, they became homeless wanderers. Countless tragedies of this kind were constantly being spread by people surrounding this piece of rubble and scorched earth. Coffins of poor quality were piled up everywhere. Among them, of course, were the "military facilities" that had been completely destroyed last night. There must still be many corpses buried in the still smoking rubble. The nearby area was filled with the stench of burnt flesh. At this moment, I suddenly saw many people gathered together in a circle. I looked and saw that they were carrying a new corpse into a coffin. The lid was still open. Inside was a completely black lump of meat. Both legs had been cut off, and the white thighbones could be seen at the cut. It was really hard to recognize that it was a human corpse. This lump of meat may have stood on the Yellow Crane Tower yesterday and sighed at the long history, or may have carried the autumn moon on the Yangtze River and been in sweet love. If it does not rain in Hankou tomorrow night, there will definitely be an unknown number of corpses appearing in the sky again, just like last night. Perhaps those who are now gazing at the corpses in a trance will become the same lump of meat tomorrow and be gazed at by others. But these people are not afraid, but just stare at this burnt lump of meat. As I looked at it, it seemed that these people were carefully observing their own inevitable future fate.</p>
<p>Yangtze River</p>
<p>An old friend bids farewell to the Yellow Crane Tower in the west, and descends to Yangzhou in the misty, flowery March. A lone sail, a distant shadow, vanishes into the blue sky, and only the Yangtze River flows to the horizon.</p>
<p>Only by standing on the Yellow Crane Tower can you truly appreciate the greatness of the Yangtze River, which is sung in Li Bai's poem. Although Du Zimei once chanted "The river comes from Guan Kou," the Yangtze River does not originate from Guan Kou in Sichuan Province, but from the Tanggula Mountains on the Tibetan Plateau and the western Kunlun Mountains. The snow accumulated in the Kunlun Mountains melts into water and flows into the Jinsha River in Sichuan, Xikang, and Yunnan provinces, a rushing torrent that flows through cliffs and gorges, and cannot be used for boating until it reaches Yibin (Xuzhou) in Sichuan Province. Even at Baidicheng in Fengjie County, at the eastern end of Sichuan Province, the current is still very rapid, and the boats are like arrows, and the wonderful scene of "The monkeys' cries on both banks cannot be stopped, and the light boat has passed ten thousand mountains" continues. But when it flows near Yichang, the Yangtze River calms down. And the river becomes wider. When it flows under the Yellow Crane Tower, 　it combines with the water of Dongting Lake, and becomes even wider, becoming a vast, turbulent current without embankments, majestic and high-spirited, rushing east. Thus unfolds the magnificent scene of "Stars hang down on the vast wilderness, and the moon surges on the great river." If the Yellow River is called the Sorrow of China, then the Yangtze River can naturally be called the Joy of China. This is definitely not just a judgment based on the scenery. In terms of the influence it has on the lives of the Chinese people, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River also have such a clear distinction. The Yangtze River connects almost all the lakes and streams in its basin, forming a good irrigation system for the rice paddies in central China. This river basin has created the most densely populated place in the world, and the variety of agricultural products is extremely diverse. Plants and animals also have all kinds of species that should be found in subtropical, temperate, and cold zones. In the area through which this great Yangtze River passes, there are still Tibetans who maintain a semi-independent Buddhist aristocratic politics, 　　tribes who continue the samurai class's building system, Miao tribes who still practice chaotic marriage and polyandry, and 　tribes whose buttocks have fleshy tails.</p>
<p>According to ichthyology, the number of species in this river basin reaches more than seventy, which can be truly called the "Kingdom of Carps." There is no salmon in the Yangtze River, but there is the Yangtze beaked sturgeon, a relative of the Russian Black Sea 　shark. In addition, Dongting Lake often has the white Nag dolphin with a sharp beak. In the Yangtze River from the estuary to Hankou, there is a small whale-like porpoise (The Indian river porpoise) that swims up the river from the sea.</p>
<p>As for vertebrates, there is the world-famous Sichuan panda (Giant panda), which is the most valuable species in the animal taxonomy between bears and raccoon dogs. As for tigers and leopards, they are not uncommon along the Yangtze River basin, and there are also 　fish. The Chinese are not very concerned about this kind of natural science along the Yangtze River. Perhaps it is because the Chinese have always been busy praising the Yangtze River with literature! But whether it is uncultivated people or animal life, as long as they are studied in detail, there will definitely be produced literature that Chinese people do not know. It is a pity that the Chinese have not done this. Emile Ludwig, a famous biographer, wrote a biography of the Nile River in 1936, "The Nile the Life Story of a River." How wonderful it would be if a Chinese writer also wrote a biography of the Yangtze River! When Emile Ludwig stood on the banks of the Nile, he felt that this river was like a great man with life, and when I stood on the Yellow Crane Tower and looked at the Yangtze River, the same feeling arose spontaneously. The water of the Yangtze River is indeed turbid, and the scenery of the Yangtze River is quite ordinary, but the water volume, width, length, and depth of the Yangtze River can always be called a giant among the world's rivers. If the Chinese revolution succeeds in the future and can fully utilize the natural power of this giant, then the face of China will definitely be completely renewed. Just as the Aswan Dam has been built, and the desert in the lower reaches of the Nile has been transformed into fertile farmland, just as the Dnieprostroy hydroelectric power plant has been completed, and a great industrial city has suddenly appeared in the Dnieper River basin, if the huge water power possessed by the Yangtze River is utilized to generate electricity, then China will no longer have to worry about insufficient power. If so, then many great industrial cities that the Chinese have never dreamed of will definitely appear in the Yangtze River basin. But, in order to realize such an era, the revolutionary task of China—independence and autonomy—must first be completed. When independence and autonomy are thoroughly realized, and national capital builds industrialization along the Yangtze River, then the phrase "Asia for Asians" will have true meaning.</p>
<p>When we think of the mere 40 million Japanese, who have even generated tremendous productive forces since the Meiji Restoration, then the China with 400 million people and the huge natural power of this Yangtze River, after completing the national revolution, will generate what a great productive force in Asia, and it is predictable.</p>
<p>Like a giant snoring loudly in sleep, quietly, yet powerfully flowing, this Yangtze River, in front of me, cannot help but make me continue to think about these things. (End) Translated by Lu</p>
<p>A Short History of Guang Sheng Xiang Sock Factory by Ren He</p>
<p>Guangshengxiang Sock Factory was founded by Mr. Qianchu, the grandfather of Mr. Yu Zhijing, a famous knitting expert and big entrepreneur. It started in the 7th year of Xianfeng in the late Qing Dynasty. In the early stage, it was opened on Qipan Street, Sima Road. At that time, foreign goods had not yet been imported in large quantities. All places regarded Guangdong goods as important, and all areas north and south of the Yangtze River regarded this company as the general hub for procurement. Until the 　3rd year of Guangxu in the late Qing Dynasty, it was moved to the western end of Henan Road, Sima Road to continue its business. At that time, Mr. Yu’s elder brother, Youpei, realized that the national situation was in danger and that promoting industry was not enough to save the country, so he invented the manufacture of mercerized silk socks in Guangdong and created various novel colors, which were sold in Hong Kong and Macao. At that time, Mr. Zhang Shaotang, the manager of the company, 　transported a large number of mercerized socks to Shanghai for sale and used his eloquence to the fullest. The storefront was called a sock factory, and this was actually the first. Later, due to the development of business, many affiliated companies were added one after another, such as Nanyang Sock Factory, Dadong Machine Factory, and Qin Yu Textile Sock and Shirt Factory. The Liuhe Company, as it is known in the market, is also the most famous Steamer, Black Cat, Crystal and 　Bo brand silk thread socks, all of which were originally sold by the company. In recent years, Mr. Yu has made further expansions in response to environmental needs, and has moved the company to the most prosperous area at the western end of Shilu, Nanjing Road. It is reported that the decoration has been completed recently and will open on the 16th of this month. At that time, there will be a grand scene. It is also reported that Mr. Yu 　Jing is currently serving as the general supervisor of the company, while Mr. Zhang Shaotang, who has been working for more than 30 years, is still the general manager, and Mr. Yu Yanji, Mr. Yu’s nephew, is the deputy general manager, and Mr. Liang Yuanjing is the manager.</p>

<h3>Thinking of Increasing Resources From Scholarship Aid</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhou</p>
<p>Another new semester is about to begin, and only two months remain. The scholarship funds for the next semester are not yet firmly secured, causing concern. Whether the thousands of students who applied for aid in the previous term can continue their in-depth studies without being affected by price fluctuations depends on whether Shanghai society, after repeated appeals from the Shen Bao, continues to maintain their concern for the future of China!</p>
<p>Now, new strategies for increasing scholarship funds are listed below. It is hoped that readers and the broad intellectual class will generously offer insightful corrections.</p>
<p>(1) Free School Places: Every year-end, wealthy merchants and powerful companies throughout the city should extract some funds from their huge revenues and directly pay them to schools. This would accommodate talented individuals who are praised by the individual company, and those recommended by the school, and continually maintain their tuition fees every semester until they graduate. It is best to also organize a committee to specialize in this matter, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. If this trend becomes popular, countless talents who are about to be buried will undoubtedly have the opportunity to raise their heads again. After refinement, they can serve the country. The large-scale training of special and professional talents relies on this.</p>
<p>(2) Percentage-Based Scholarship Aid: The huge amount of daily retail sales and transaction funds of major companies throughout Shanghai is astonishing. If they can automatically and universally carry out percentage-based scholarship aid, or specially select a day to collect attached scholarship donations, the results will be considerable. The percentage for scholarship aid can range from 1% to 10%, depending on the company. The attached scholarship donations are entirely voluntary from customers, and the amount should ideally be only one li, solicited voluntarily by the staff. Since the amount is small, and based on the principle of doing good is the greatest joy, customers will naturally comply. Little by little, a huge sum of tens of millions of yuan can be established immediately. Every time a customer completes a transaction, the staff should give a specially printed two-part receipt with the seal of an impartial organization (one part is kept by the store for submitting the donation). Once the accumulated amount reaches 1,000 yuan, it should be immediately submitted to the Shen Bao or other designated collection agency to complete the procedure. It is hoped that the enlightened members of the city's industrial and commercial sectors can set an example and take the lead immediately, which will surely receive a great response.</p>
<p>(3) Penalties: Recently, the authorities have implemented a fourth round of water and electricity conservation, reducing consumption by another 50% based on the original limit. There is no doubt that the number of penalized users will increase significantly. The amount of fines is expected to be substantial. It is hoped that China Water &amp; Electric and French Water &amp; Electric companies can adhere to the principle of taking from society and giving back to the public, and donate the increased penalty income entirely or partially to scholarship funds. This would truly be a wise and appropriate measure, and the various misunderstandings and criticisms that the public has had about the two companies in the past can also be dispelled invisibly. Millions of poor and outstanding students are waiting for your support. It is hoped that all powerful members of the city can unite and respond broadly, not just being satisfied with maintaining existing achievements. Then, China's national fortune can, due to the reduction of illiteracy, gladly turn towards a more glorious and splendid path in the near future.</p>
<p>The Difficulties of Implementing a "Half-Day School System" — Zuo Qi</p>
<p>The National Forum on November 30 published an article entitled "The Problem of School Classes After Air Control and Power Saving," which proposed that schools adopt a half-day school system after power saving. It said, "...All schools in the city should uniformly adopt a half-day school system, from 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM, ...all should perform morning exercises, ...". The author has some humble opinions, stated as follows:</p>
<p>(1) If classes start at 8:00 AM (and if morning exercises are strictly enforced, students must arrive at school by 7:40 AM), students must get up no later than 6:30 AM. At this time, the sky is not yet bright, which will inevitably increase the lighting time in students' homes, contradicting the purpose of saving electricity.</p>
<p>(2) If all schools in the city uniformly adopt a half-day school system, what about teachers who originally had concurrent classes in both the morning and afternoon? If they give up part of their concurrent classes, how will teachers whose lives are already strained make a living?</p>
<p>(3) Because housing is difficult to find and school buildings are insufficient, how can this system be implemented for those who already have morning and afternoon classes (such as Shanghai Municipal Yucai and Gezhi Middle Schools, one attending in the morning and one in the afternoon; Qingxin Girls' Elementary and Middle School, the middle school attending in the morning and the elementary school attending in the afternoon)?</p>
<p>(4) Young students who enter school at 7:00 AM need to wait until about 1:30 PM to have lunch, which is harmful to their health.</p>
<p>The difficulties in implementing a half-day school system are as mentioned above. Therefore, before actual implementation, the above points need to be considered.</p>

<h3>Relieving Poor People in Winter: Red Swastika Society Plans to Set Up Winter Shelters, Master Ku Qi Generously Donates Five Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, in view of the suffering of the poor in winter, has set up a porridge kitchen in Xieqiao, Nanshi, which will open soon. Recently, a letter was received from Master Ku Qi, who vowed to set up a shelter to save the poor and entrusted the society to organize it. All expenses for clothing, bedding, and food will be provided by Master Ku Qi himself, and he first handed over 5 million yuan of national currency to the Swastika Society for preparation. It is said that the Society expressed great sympathy for Master Ku Qi's enthusiasm and determination and has agreed to accept the donation. They are now actively preparing food, clothing, and bedding and have stipulated that they will start accepting 400 male poor people from the 11th of this month. The method will follow the regulations of the vagrant training center. The Society has sent letters to various management offices to collect and send the poor to the Swastika Society. Only those who pass the doctor's examination will be accepted.</p>
<h3>Great China Factory Generously Donates Fifty Sets of Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>A letter from Great China Rubber Factory Xingye Co., Ltd. states: "To whom it may concern, there are many who indulge themselves, and there are not a few who are impoverished and unable to extricate themselves. In view of this, our factory has made 50 sets of cotton-padded clothing. However, we do not have a proper plan for distribution. We have long admired your office for handling relief in a practical and realistic manner. Therefore, we have instructed someone to deliver the clothing. Please check and accept it. Although the number is small, it may be of some slight help." The Great China Factory's charity is admirable. In addition to properly distributing the delivered winter clothing, we hereby express our gratitude on their behalf.</p>
<h3>The Pain of Losing Eyesight Will Be Forever Remembered</h3>
<p>There is a Mr. Xie whose son unfortunately died in a car accident in September. Now that the hundredth day has arrived, he specially donated 50,000 yuan as winter relief funds to leave a permanent memorial. We hereby express our gratitude on behalf of the impoverished recipients. The original letter is as follows: "To whom it may concern, my second son, Shizhang, was 24 years old. This summer, in June, he graduated from the Engineering Department of Datong University, ranking among the best, and twice received the Fei Gong Scholarship. He was deeply valued by his teachers. At the beginning of July, he joined the Shanghai Administration Bureau of China Central Railway, serving as a member of the Engineering Department. Unfortunately, on September 22, while returning to Shanghai from Jiaxing to inspect a project, he was involved in a tragic car accident on Maigen Road and died. His colleagues and friends were all saddened. We are grateful for the condolence money of about 50,000 yuan from the Hua Tie authorities and fellow comrades. In addition to a simple burial, we also reduced customary wasteful expenses. Now that the hundredth day of my deceased son has arrived, we will use the 50,000 yuan of condolence money for winter clothing and porridge donations as a memorial to my deceased son."</p>

Our hospital has self-made a special cold relief ointment, which is extremely effective for treating chronic coughs and infantile pertussis. Apply it to the throat and the two acupoints on the second vertebra of the back, changing it once a week, and it can be cured in three weeks.

<h3>Charity Sale of Silk Gown Material, Hoping for Enthusiastic Bidding</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Junxin, on his fortieth birthday last year, was given a piece of first-class silk gown material produced by the German Lelihe Yangxing by relatives and friends. It has now been identified (1.9 chi long, 0.8 chi wide in the waist, 2.5 chi long in the sleeves, and 0.6 chi wide in the cuffs). He originally intended to make it into clothing for himself, but remembering the hardship of the times, there are countless people suffering from hunger and cold. Mr. Chen was heartbroken by this and was unwilling to wear this luxurious clothing. Therefore, he sent the material to our office for a charity sale, with a starting price of 100,000 yuan. The proceeds will be used for various charitable activities of our office. Mr. Chen's enthusiasm for public welfare is commendable. It is hoped that everyone will participate in the charity, not only fulfilling Mr. Chen's kindness but also benefiting countless people. It's a win-win situation. Why not join us?</p>
