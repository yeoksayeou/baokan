<p>社評</p>
<h3>等不得</h3>
<p>時間是人生最重要的因素，敏捷是成功的不二法門，平時如此，戰時亦然。前方如此，後方亦然。</p>
<p>拿破崙在奧法之戰後說，他之所以能擊敗奧國的軍隊，因為奧國的軍隊不懂得「五分鐘」時間的價値，錯過一分鐘時間就多予「不幸」以一分可乘之機。因為這方面在時間上落後一着，就使那方面在時間上佔先一着。戰爭好比下棋，有時「一着之錯一，可使「全盤皆失」。</p>
<p>我們常常說把握現在，努力現在，用意在叫火不要空想過去，空想將來。因為第一，空想是沒有用處的，空想的結果只有使行動延緩，行動延緩的結果就是誤事。第二過去造因，現在結果，現在造因，就是將來的結果。我們希望國家社會將來結好果，就得在現在種善因。我們的工作就在種因，空想是沒有用處的。俗語所謂「前大種樹，後人乘凉」，這是維延國家民族的眞精神，凡是希望子子孫孫將來能够乘凉的，現在必須努力種樹。</p>
<p>努力現在是實行的事，更不是一句空話。天夭講好的理想，天天講好的計劃，而沒有勇氣使好的理想實現，沒有勇氣執行好的計劃，理想和計刻都是徒然的。其次，錯過了一個時間，錯過了一個機會，好的理想和好的計劃在實行的時候又得重新修改，適應環境，使施行便利。再次也是最重要的，就是錯過了一個時間，或許使你永久得不到實行好理想，執行好計劃的機會。所以努力現在是要立刻實行的，是等不得的。</p>
<p>現代戰爭是國方比賽，是國方的接方饗。在賽跑塲上，你接到了棍，必須立刻往前跑，一秒鐘都等不得，必須跑到第二站把棍子交給別人，纔得休息。假使是跑終點的，就要一鼓作氣，勇往直前，不到終點，不能放鬆一步。今年是決戰年，正是大家跑上終點的時候，任何國家的國民都巳經接到了棍子，政府的當局便是第一個接到棍子的人，他要領導一羣「全體國民賽跑隊」向目的地跑去。看誰先到終點，誰就得到勝利。千鈞一髮的時侯，一秒鐘都等不得，一步路都停不得，如果遲了一些，勝敗已分，此賽已了，你就想再跑，也已經是來不及了。</p>
<p>在這一次大東亞戰爭裏，中國的命進最好，因為道一隊大東亞競賽隊晨，最好的選手盟邦日本是我們的先鋒，巳經在賽跑塲上佔先了許多步位，使對方要費許多氣力來追趕。因為盟邦的努力使我們省了許多精力，省了許多時間？這是我們的好機會。現在是快到終點了，盟邦日木的努力要使全體選手都到達目的地，難道我們連跑最後一站的勇氣都沒有嗎？雜道我們還要等嗎？雜迫我們還要拖累我們的同伴嗎？</p>
<p>一個人的好機會是難得遇着的，國家的好機會更是百年艱再，抓住好機會而努力是最重要的工作。「莫等閒，白了少年頭，空悲切」。我們願意把岳武穆的這句話貢獻給國人。</p>
<h3>英軍遭慘重打擊攻緬企圖成泡影　日軍掃蕩戰所獲戰國極大</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電緬甸前綫六日：緬印方面日軍前為擊減於布其頓前面來犯之英軍第七師，發動殲減戰以來，自二月四日在罵猶河畔突破敵陣後，僅二十日即將敵主力之殘存驅逐團困於辛澤瓦盆地，而展開掃蕩戰，使敵遭受重創。迄今日軍所獲戰果至為重大計敵軍遺屍七千（內英軍至少約三千），俘敵六百，此外，並有大批印兵投效印度國民軍外，並截獲敵速射砲十門，迫擊砲十一門，重輕機關槍九六挺，曁自動步槍，手槍彈藥，被服馬匹　無算，並破壞敵十米厘加農砲及十五米厘溜彈砲二十一們·達射砲二十門·高射砲六門·戰車四十五輛。卡車六百六十輛。舟艇十七艘及其他軍需甚多。按此統計僅為日軍在戰爭進行中所確認者，此外·敵棄屍及遺棄兵器而未經日軍收容者，常為數甚多，故敵資際之損失敵目，必較此為大，此次戰果與去春於阿拉坎作戰所獲戰果相較，鹵獲品方面不相上下，至敵遣屍則較前次阿拉坎之役增加一千入百具，俘虜則增加入十四人。英軍第七師所遭情形，略與前次阿拉坎之役英印軍第十四師所遭遇者相同，若通或經證實之敵軍損害在內，則英第七師之損失程度較甚，英第七師之潰減，使敵軍反攻緬甸之企圖已成泡影。同時敵軍此次所受打學之慘車，欲與短期內恢復殆不可能。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電阿拉坎日軍　則綫某基地訊：印度國民軍為爭取祖國獨立，此次與日軍並肩作戰，活躍於阿拉坎戰綫，寶極引人注目，印度國民軍或執槍向英軍衝鋒，或忍痛射擎向日軍陣地撲來之同胞。辛澤瓦盆地一役，印度國民軍一隊與日軍長臨繞至敵軍背後方，切斷敵軍退路，於那基安典北方炸毀敵退路上之機塲，並猛攻附近之敵軍，獲得大批重耍機密文件。十七日晚與日軍取得聯絡，攻佔那基安興北方六公里之敵軍慕地，並擊潰敵軍汽車部隊，最近該軍則協力日軍，祖任切斷正面敵軍退路之任務，迎日實行夜襲，與日軍並肩以白刃衝入敵陣，將敵殲滅。總之，印度國民軍將士為爭取祖國獨立，正　續奮門，已在自由印度之新歷史上，增添光輝之一頁。</p>
<h3>渝共談判決裂　發生嚴重糾紛　渝認共調減過於苛刻</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於渝共糾紛問題益趨嚴重，　　擦掌。最近又據本市有關當局，濩得渝共糾紛消息。此項事鶴，係刊截於本月五日美國共和黨之喉舌報紙，其中提出渝將在除夕開羅會議時，發表中共之活動，誠非中國之好現象。渝蔣本人以該情形與渝蘇外交係屬連貫性，更促使蔣之不安，遂向美總統羅斯福申訴苦衷云云。同時淪方在表面聽從英美之勸告，為避免正面內　，擬謀取政治手段。解决雜紛起見，會於本年一月四日，特派要員遄赴西安，與共黨代表談判。當時共黨方面即提出條件頗多，包括政治。經濟。文化。軍事。各項問題。渝方代表認為共黨所提條件過於苛刻，大為不滿。渝代表賀耀組。商震二人即返渝，並辭去代表之職，遂向大公報記者發表談話，謂延安所提絛件，以假借統一戰綫名義，企圖奪取政權。尤其關於軍事方面，野心益露·共黨如此態度，渝方自難讓那個不·並拒絕與之交涉。並謂此次決裂，乃因共黨毫無　意之結果。嗣後共黨方面亦發表聲明，由陳紹禹向塔斯社合衆社記者談話，認偷方始終敷衍推諉·毫無具體表示·是以不得不爭一取共同目的，耍求促渝反省云。　當渝共談判决裂後·渝方即派軍隊包圍延安。據聞有胡宗南部隊三師團，在西安進發，傳作義部隊二師，向五原推推，此外三師團並向榆林包圍當談判央裂後·雙方軍隊發生對峙情形異常嚴軍·從西安赴延安檢查頗嚴，以封鎖延安為對策。故自去年八月渝共嚴重　後，最近又將再底發生。</p>
<h3>大將派員際掃將母墓</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　蔣介石盲目抗戰失敗以來，其最大苦惱，為不能祭掃故鄉亡母之墓。日中國派　軍總司令官　大將，基於武士道之熟忱，特於去歲暮，命注政信部隊長前往致祭。　部隊長受命後，當邀國府軍祝靑川中將，同至蔣之故里奉化縣溪口鎮敵　。溪口鎮位於最后近渝軍之地區。致　之日及其他親屬多人參加，有將之外甥王義國，們人中且有已有出家之蔣之從弟某法師。烟總司令官除以大花圈一個為祭品外，一並遺儈人於　前誦經一七日，將之　友對日軍當局如此寬厚仁　之風，　不深致感佩。</p>
<h3>蒙特巴頓　指揮無方</h3>
<p>備受美方指摘</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　海通社訊，美方消息：華盛頓某要員指摘蒙特巴頓之印緬戰爭，迄無重大成就，僅取守勢而非攻勢，日軍控制該處河道，英國即無阻撓其運輸之希望。</p>
<h3>菲列濱敎徒　雍護政府</h3>
<p>馬尼刺六日中央社電為確立菲列寶共和國基礎，該國內之天主敎徒及新敎徒等各宗敎團體，曾一致决議以全力擁護洛勒爾政府。擁有百五十萬信徒之菲列賓獨立敎會阿古里派敎，曾舉動全國代表會議，二日議决支持洛勒爾政府之政策。故菲島全基督敎徒之協力政府體制更趨羣固，宗不敎團髁與政府化為一體後，對於新國家各種建設之推進，當有絕大之貢獻。</p>
<h3>回敎穆聖誕辰　昭南盛大慶祝</h3>
<p>昭南大日中央社電六日為回敎穆聖誕辰，此間各戶均高懸回敎旗與日旗，以示慶賀，一般回敎徒更以虔敬之誠慶賀此日，是晨有男回敎徒約千人，分二批集合於凱關路與麻六田路，於上午十時分別列隊遊行，馬萊入阿拉伯仁及印度人之回敎徒等雙手搖動回敎旗與日旗，齊唱讚美歌，十一時半進人淸眞寺裏拜祈禱，並祝大東亞戰爭造日獲得勝利　。禮拜舉，赴回敎馬來學校休息，下午四時舉行斷食儀式，盛況空前，為昭南戰後所罕有。</p>
<h3>緬甸閣議通過明年度預算案　將增加稅收購買米</h3>
<p>仰光六日中央社電緬甸政府於四日之閣議席上，附議明年预算，並通過政府之原案，俟經機密院决定後，最近即將正式决定。據預算案歲入額為六千九白萬盧比，歲出為二億入千一萬盧比，所差之二億一千二百萬歲比由緬甸國銀行借入補塡之，歲出之中包括米豰資金之特別會計一千七自萬膚比。上項预算案與去年十月所决定之本期预算相較，歲人增加二千七百萬盧比，歲出增加九千四百萬盧此。緬甸政府會編　製明年度预算案時，特置重點於擴充國防治安以及對日協助諸方面，對於歲人方面即計劃將所得稅提　若干，關於從來之利稅及其他制度亦特加以變更，利用規行之機構可能限度內，保持收人之計劃額數，復於財務部預算上加入預備金，以期施行預算時發揮其彈力性。至米穀購入資克，實際反較去年減少·並决定將木年度之米穀購買臨時費支出與新預算合作，作為購賣米穀資金，此種計劃對於米穀之自給自足方策貫獻甚大。</p>
<h3>歐洲戰局槪觀</h3>
<p>蘇聯在軍部戰綫的攻勢，漸達最高潮。展初在南部烏克蘭區域開始攻擊的紅軍，未能一舉而下特尼泊爾河套內的各地。至於中部戰餞，推向羅為尼亞國境方面，在木年一月上旬，雖已突破舊波關國境若干點，但遭德軍的抵抗，攻勢告挫。至此，東部戰綫的主要戰場乃移至從列寗格勒到伊爾門湖，貝布斯關之北方地區。其前鋒業已到達愛沙尼亞國境，目前正在激戰中。</p>
<p>東部戰錢的此種嚴重情勢，因有關英美登睦歐洲的企圖，甚至於大東亞戰爭的動向，故對蘇聯今後的動向，不能不持密切的關心。</p>
<p>紅軍進出限度</p>
<p>紅軍是否乘騎虎之勢，　　進軍呢　蘇聯方面的立場：</p>
<p>蘇聯會不斷的宣書說是防衛的戰爭。</p>
<p>過去二年半來樂已遂行不上算的戰爭，因而無力窮追德軍，且這在蘇聯木身亦非得策</p>
<p>興其現在盡了所有的力量，徽底的擊潰德國·不如不斷的努力充實國力，以備將來應付英美。</p>
<p>反過來說，蘇聯到了某一時期，德國的存在不成為重大的威脅時，必須德國的存在·　英美不願蘇聯在南巴爾幹，北波羅的海三國，及北歐握有獨占糊。</p>
<p>縮短戰線之利</p>
<p>再從德國方國來看德軍已將一城一市的損失視為　外，自去年以來，根據大作戰計劃，整理戰綫，而完成了最有利的能勢。退避作戰巳經告終，蘇聯如再窮追，反為德國所歡迎，且正如反軸心軍在南議會帶不進，在口頭高唱等陸而不實有一樣，蘇聯亦未必軍於作一决戰。大家雖欲各出全力，一舉以决戰來展開局勢，但戰局的關係太複雜了，且將來的問題，亦多如山續不易獲得解决。</p>
<p>英美蘇的策略</p>
<p>以此看來，東部戰綫的重壓，止於地圖上的威脅，問鏗却在於敵人在政治上利用這種情勢的策略。其　候第一為中立國方面盛傳的德蘇及德英關係上新情勢的可能性之問題。第二，對南方巴　幹諸國，北方波羅的海三國及芬關的政治政勢·前者是英美對保，羅二國的策略；後者是蘇聯在政治上　補其軍事弱點的策略。但巴爾幹諸國覺悟除與德國同心一體以外，別無生存之道。而芬蘭亦批評蘇聯的新措置不過欲在將來的國際交涉上獲得較多的投票績而已，什麼自由解放尊重獨立，乃是侵略主滿的變形。</p>
<p>對中立國攻勢</p>
<p>呼應這蘇聯的政治活動的是英美的「中立國攻勢」之前進與盲炸德國的歐化。即英美乘壓迫阿根廷之餘勢，攻擊西。葡兩國。並在土·瑞典活動，計劃將證餞個國家拉到反軸心方面來。遭要之乃因</p>
<p>一·英美今日還沒有在歐洲講成有决定意義的第二戰棧之實力。</p>
<p>一·以空炸削弱德國的戰力者，一面是容納蘇聯的要求，一面乃欲　　　　的報復力。</p>
<p>一·空襲之全面的強化，一般人相信英美軍的歐洲島陸將行開始。</p>
<p>一·利用道租背景，在形成有决定意義的第而戰綫以前，為　因其政治的立場，並為監親蘇聯的活動，乃不斷的將中立國拉撤到反軸心方面。</p>
<p>從上述東部戰棧的新情勢而來的政治影響·正用種種形式實現中，但根本全視德國國內情形如何。今日德國的事情情，乃在傾全力充實國力，以備來日的反攻。（翔：譯自二月六日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>國父逝世紀念　京市擴大植樹</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　本月十二日為國父逝世紀念，為紀念國父生前之　功偉續，除由各報出版紀念特刊外，各機關團體並分別舉行紀念儀式。會後即赴國父陸國參加柏　典禮，擴大植樹。</p>
<h3>京綢價下跌</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　本京各棉布商，因當局會禁止棉布自由買　，故均大量囤進綢緞，　供操　市價，綢緞市價受此　影響，價格逐步上漲。惟自當局頒佈除滬市外，蘇浙皖三省及京市准許棉在自由買賣後，人心總疲，綢緞市價乃告下跌，一般囤戶無不焦灼，誠所謂自食其果。</p>

<h3>新幾內亞島上空日陸軍機隊戰果　襲威瓦克敵機十一架被毀</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電新幾內亞運日有激叩之空電，陸軍機隊會於四日上午九時遠擊來襲威瓦克南方入十公里之安克拉　之敵（，門機　41型五十架，擊落其十一架，　機勢敗，旋即還去。又是日下午三時，日　曾空襲敵馬拉瓦　機場，與敵戰門機展開空戰，擊落其P41型一架，並反覆棉炸停放場內之敵機，其小型機一架，中彈起火外，更有中型小型敵幾十五架受創，是役日機有二架未返原防。</p>
<p>南太平洋日軍戰略反軸心亦深為嘆服</p>
<p>沮里克六日中央社電　據英週刊雜誌戰論太平洋方面日軍反擊戰之概觀如次：揆諸事實，可知日軍於進攻時係所向無敵者。而於從事防擊戰時，亦同樣令人生畏。且日軍最高司令部之戰略，與西歐各國軍事當局之戰略全屬不同，彼等有時雖因縮短戰錢而移轉陣地，或從難以保守之地城撤退，或由於食繼軍需之缺乏而轉移，但决不會因此而降伏。反軸心軍大多期待新幾內亞之拉埃，芬希哈罕。及波根維爾島等處之日軍能陷於絕望之窘境，然於反軸心軍攻入拉埃及芬希哈罕時所受之打擊，誠非彼等所能預料者。</p>

<h3>太平洋作戰上　英美意見參商　軍發揮內綫作戰妙用</h3>
<p>美國的所謂「對日總反攻」的性格，乃不顧一國龐大犧牲，僅恃其物質之量的優勢，推進「跳島作戰」，但　侖　觀察報的軍事解說記者，在該報上著論說：</p>
<p>一反軸心陣棧的戰爭資源不是無限的。所以像現在反軸心軍在太平洋上犧牲重大的大規模作戰，使反軸心陣綫的職爭資源逐漸消耗，並立即影饗到歐洲戰局，而在反軸心軍的對德作戰上給與重大的打擊。</p>
<p>該記者並指出反軸心方而的作戰計劃，無論是對德戰，對日戰，反軸心國應亙相密切協議。然面美國當進行此次大規模的戰爭時，事前與英國方面並無聯絡，故英方深表不滿，並且美國在對日範中無止戰錢」雖於實現，因而對於美國的對日戰，英方亦深表危懼。其論調的大旨如次：</p>
<p>掩護二師的大量艦船</p>
<p>美國的對日作戰，我們英國决不能視同寺閑。這祇要想到美國在罵紹爾羣島登陸作戰上，怎樣使用了大量的艦船就可以明暸。即參加攻學馬紹爾羣島的艦船量，至少可以運輸美軍二十師團到歐洲。反軸心軍的北蜚團役中，為要使距　歐洲大陸僅百五十哩的北非變成對歐作戰的跳板，我們的努力怎樣呢？我們在編成使用於北非及義大利作戰中的攻擎艦隊時，實費了幾個月的集中的努力。</p>
<p>對此，為要使馬紹爾　島諸環確變為對距離千三百哩的特魯克島，及距　千八百哩的關島作戰的跳板，反軸心方面應支付怎樣的努力與物量呢？那遠非北非作毀可比。要運輸二個師團的兵力，及其所需要的物量，赴距離基地三千哩的地點，必須二百萬噸的盤船，而“這些艦船本身也必須補給，因而不能不遂漸建設前進基地，以備第二步的行動。瀘裘所需要的物量盤船之龐大，實可驚嘆。對歐作戰上所需要的船舶，與馬紹爾作戰上所需要的艫船量比較起夾，眞微不足道。且在馬紹爾登陸的美軍，還不够攻擊太平洋上日軍的最樞要基地，因而必須更多的軍隊與更多的運輸船。對於船舶的這種要求，就使美國的造船大王亨利。卡　也不禁為之震驚。</p>
<p>事前未獲諒解二面作戰</p>
<p>在奎貝克的羅邱會談中，美方並未宣明這種規模的太平洋作戰，而且美國今後為仍　續，反軸心方而當覺意外。反軸心方面當前最困難的是第二戰綫問題，然而太平洋作戰较此尤為因難。反軸心方面央國的產美要員與他們犧牲的精神，不能不將受更可怕的試鍊。太平洋的現階段戰局酷似東部戰綫起來。我們前錄所到的地方，都是日　的基地。遍佈太平洋全面，成為縱深的戰綫。攻繫馬紹爾不過第一步的　試。何况日本還有許多可以微集為軍隊，儼用為軍需工人的國民，其軍事實力還極雄厚。海軍差不多保持大東亞開戰時同樣的勢力，陸海軍航空部隊亦未見有何實力低下的黴兆。」</p>
<p>日軍戰略態勢穩固</p>
<p>瑞典京城的達格斯波斯登報的軍　記者亦表示同樣的見解如左：</p>
<p>今後日美間决定的　戰縱使是無可避免，但日本擭得最有利的時期，集結艦隊於最近中心基地的有利海面交戰的自由，因而美國海軍無論怎樣誇示其物質上的優務「要與日軍之有利的戰略地位對抗是不可能的。從列勢轉為守勢以來的日軍，由於少數守備隊及小艦隊的　戰，隨地邀學美軍的進擊，軍以極大損害－即所謂出血戰術。且美關縱使　得局部的戰果，但在空而的口美大規模部的對日作戰，似更注重於日木所視為遼遠的　據的中央進攻路；但與此呼應的且美國最所希望的西南太平洋運衡作戰，因日軍的強化防備，還未實現，所以日軍正在發揮內機作戰的妙用，而得以各個擊破的成算，因此而　有開把握。在這意義上今後的太平洋戰局，查値得重視。－（翔：譯自二月十五日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<h3>舊波蘭邊境　展開攻防戰　蘇出動步兵十四師團</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　據海通社訊：蘇軍在希佩托夫加（Sheptovka）万面猛攻早為德軍司令部所預料。最近德機會屢續轟炸蘇軍集中地點加以重創，然蘇軍仍以步兵約十二師至十四師及坦克車三隊進攻，在德軍陣綫造成缺口數處，戰况劇烈為東棧所罕見。希佩托夫加在貝狄夷夫（Beadlchev）至羅夫諾（Rovno）鐵路綫上，適當蘇軍　形陣地魯資克（Rutsk）羅夫諾。社勃諾（Dudno）三角形之南。蘇軍之目的尚不可知是否與克里伏洛格以南之戰事有關，亦難斷言。東綫醫同除希佩托失加以外，均無變化，僅維特勃斯克。那爾叩。及浦斯科夫方面，戰况較為劇烈。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社叩入德軍防綫達四公里之廣，德為節省兵力起見，遂退至砲火掩護下之陣地。</p>
<p>南北兩路戰况劇烈</p>
<p>蘇軍第二攻勢中心，係在庇普斯湖及芬蘭　之間，乃以使波羅的海三國重入其歷制之　而已。又於另一方面，更欲使芬蘭於任何代價下接受停戰，蘇軍欲以奪取那爾瓦通路之戰，以擭得佔領芬蘭波海沿岸。克里伏洛格之南，於前數日所造成之裂口中，增調更多之援軍，竟日猛烈進攻，蘇軍擴大其裂口數百公尺，但其突破企圖終於失敗。</p>
<p>德國空軍東綫活躍　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍界宣稱：德空軍星期六不顯不良　氣之阻　，沿金部東綫活躍作戰數百猛炸前進中之蘇軍縱隊及坦克車，前鋒隊軍隊展開處。在齊洛平德機炸燬蘇軍大砲，使之沉寂無聲，在庇普斯湖芬蘭　之問，德機猛炸敵軍堡壘及燬其大砲多門。</p>

<h3>智利承認　阿根廷政府</h3>
<p>里期本六日中央社電　據紐約所擭合衆社消息：智利政府已承認阿根廷之法列爾政府，並宣告謂，視法列爾政府為賴米寗茲政府之延續。又據合衆社阿京消息，南美數國政府已通知華盛頓，謂彼等如再與阿根廷有糾紛，則將蒙受經濟上之困難。南美有數國已决定擺脫互相磋商辦法，此項辦法乃為關明彼等之對阿態度而開始者。此項磋商辦法之戰止，或將使對玻利維亞之態度亦將再受考慮，南美政府已通知華盛頓謂拒絕承認該利維亞新政府之舉，已缺乏　際之效果。</p>
<p>日內瓦六日中央社電德國新聞社訊，據美聯社駐烏拉圭京域訪員稱：烏拉圭曁巴拉圭已準備隨智利曁破利維亞之後而承認新阿根廷政府，此舉或將種汎美洲共同關係上發生裂痕，而由柯根廷領導斑織南美國家集團。</p>

<p>美國舉措不營最後通碟</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電德國新　社訊：美阿斷絕外交關係，係以西半球受到德國威脅為藉口。美洲各國均一致認識美國之善磷政策，乃係要求各國對美國政治上及經濟上之獨栽無條件投降而已。阿國現所能享受經濟上之繁榮者，亦皆出於其中立政策之所賜，但此與華盛之頓計劃相左，故　國以封　塔拉塔河口為威賣，以區迫阿國與軸心國斷絕關係，最近復欲使阿國成為反軸心之一員。華盛頓方面所發動之宣傳戰及神經戰，其所標榜之民主原則及公共利益之口號，此迫阿國之投降也。美國現乃破壞大西洋憲章，比之邱吉爾最近之演說更有甚焉。</p>

<h3>保安處偵查隊　破獲田雞案　主犯凌維顧長發落綱</h3>
<p>中央社訊　邇來本市拐騙小童剝衣謀　案件迭起，其手段　殘令人髮指　本市保安處偵查隊隊長顧寶林，有鑒及此，因案關强盜殺人，特組織特別調查班，偵騎四出，限一期破案，得悉被騙兒童，均由冒充軍人模樣之人領帶，即着重此點力求水落石出。直至本月二日，注有成在大新遊樂場突發見一行跡可疑之靑年，身穿軍式服裝，</p>

<h3>滬西區　發現天花蔓延　衛生處積極進行痘</h3>
<p>中央社訊　本市滬四區，靜安寺路永源浜，大西駱曹家弄，極司非而路康家指。開納路內曹家宅等處，近來發現眞正天花，巳有一部份居民因罹斯疾而吿不治。故第一區公署西區第四衛生處，鑒於區內天花之蔓延極速，故日來正積極進行預防工作，除將發現天花地點以消毒外，並函知　甲當局轉知該區一般市民前往種痘，並發給證書，日內並將由驚局派員寬施全面檢查，如無牛痘證者，將予處分，故日來區內居民前往種痘者數極踴躍，愚園路一三六〇號西區衛生處已自昨（六）日起，開始全天免費種痘，盼一般市民從速至該處種痘，以事預防。　　嚴防腦膜炎流行當局盼公衆攝生</p>
<p>腦膜炎之流行，業已引起衛生處當局注意，除已由副處長發表談話，　居民善自攝生外，並在公共衛生設置上實施各項預防，諸如公家醫院對於該病患者之悉心醫治及嚴密隔離。公共場所之奉令洗通空氣，及調節冷暖，勿使一般居民於不注意時即受寒，同時且鼓勵公衆作預防之注射，及申請種痙，但對於各醫院疫苗之質料，衛生處則亦極予注意，務使其保持淸潔。</p>

<h3>規模最大的　難童敎養機關—上海難童敎養院—</h3>
<p>困難與期望</p>
<p>正因為規模極大，所以雖然辦理得相當完善，而且一般事務費用，力事撙節，但是經費方面，仍表現極大的困難。首先是伙食方面，據陸總幹事說，每月可領口米約為十二擔八斗七升，合為七千七百二十二元，（以舊價每升六兀計）戶口麵粉一千八百零九斤，合一萬二千六百六十三元（以舊概每斤七元計）以上只敷食十六天。另有特別配給米每月士袋，每袋以舊價八百九十一元八角計，合六千二百四十元五角。約敷七天食用。其餘就須求諸黑市米，每月至少九擔（七天食用），每擔以舊價一百六十六元計，又需一萬四千四百元。若以今日市價言，每月單以食糧一項開支，合計已須四萬七千元以上，此外燃料，為節省計，以礱糠為主，每月一百二十據，約需四千八百元，煤球每月至少十擔，則共計亦非五六千元不可，伙食敎職員午晚七桌，每桌僅合十六元，粥菜三桌半，每桌合三元，每天合三百二十入元。院生二五四人，每人以七角五分計，每天合一百九十元以上；院役二人及廚司入人，每人以一元五角計，合十五元，全月共需伙食費約一萬元。其他日用品，書籍。文具。薪水。什項。修理。水電等合計，約共二萬元。因此，目前開支每月所需約達上入萬元以上，而院生所需衣被之費還未計入呢！（編者按：最近數月來生活倍漲，開支富不一截此數）。</p>
<p>上海難童敎養機關中值得誇耀之外，沒有大額的固定收入。本年新春，曾向上海市貧病救濟協會請求補助，由委員榮柏雲氏前往調查，認為在開支方面，尙須盡力節約，勸吿減少廚司，另選年長兒童輪洗任之，每月亦可節省膳食約達一千元左右。同時認為該院辦理尙佳，且屬經費困難，似宜加以補助。旋經該會决定但在該院方面，仍以物價高漲，開支迭增，困難尙未能全部解除。據稱普通捐款收入，每月僅有認養捐二千餘元及樂隊服務捐款六七千元而巳。其餘不足之數，除由社會熱心人士慨助外，概由院長向各界勸募而來，因此常在拮据之中。陸總幹事最後再三表示，他們希望各界人士前往參觀，多加指導，以作改進南針。</p>
<p>懷着替這二百五十多名難童祝福的心情，離開上海難童敎養院的剎那，瞥見該院的「信條」，似乎值得在這裏介紹一下：看看那難意苦楚，想想自己的生活。關懷本院的仕女，都是難童的救星。樂善好施的效能，是為國家儲眞才。誠意的救濟難窟。比燒香吃素還好。彼此能互助博愛，世界就可以大同。慈善事業的完成，基於整個的人類。（完）</p>

<h3>軍事宣傳團赴緬　具重大意義　松平報道部長發表談話</h3>
<p>日大使館松平報道部長六日於接見我國記者團席上就國府派遺軍事宜傳團赴印緬戰綫事發表談話並對該團深表敬意稱：</p>
<p>安抵前綫</p>
<p>此次國府派遺這軍事宣傳團赴印緬的綫，與日軍及緬甸政府，自由印度臨時政府，在深密協力下積極推進各項施策，茲據國府宣傳部發表，該團已於二月中旬安抵目的地，此舉引起各方面重大注意。蓋印度獨立運動。素為中國人士所關心並　表同情，去秋大東亞會戰後，自由印度臨時政府主席飽斯氏曾來華訪問以後，國府當局，對印度之獨立遝動，有更深切之　心　同情，乃决定派遣軍事官傳團赴緬。</p>
<p>渝方政策</p>
<p>現仍派遣軍隊赴印度，維持英國所企圖之印度現狀，並協力英國使緬甸再成殖民地化，此舉實予印度獨立運動者以極大之失望，然國府則派遣軍事宣傳團赴緬，協力印度民族獨立運動，並維特緬甸之獨立，此舉予緬甸官民及印度獨立連動者以極大之感奮”</p>
<p>深致期待</p>
<p>該團出發前，在南京受訓之際，余曾被邀對團員發表演說，並得與團員懇談之機會，團員等均為智識份子，且具經騐及勇氣，並誓以同生共死之精神，活躍於大東亞戰爭之最前綫，團員等之此種精神，使余異常感動。今知該團已安抵印緬前錢，協力大東亞解放戰，余在此遙對該團團員深表敬意，並期待該團工作之進展。</p>

<h3>府君行述　會立明羣</h3>
<p>按曾公冶先生，任本報稽核部主任，服務二十餘年，忠動職守，為人和羣同事之間，相處翕然，不幸於今年二月八日逝世，享年七十六歲，同人莫不悼惜，今由其哲嗣撰述行狀，略為節載，以責悼念編者附識。</p>
<p>府君曾氏，諱鈞。字子恭，號公冶。失大父生先伯等兄弟二人，府君行次，生而岐嶷，得天獨厚，有淸光緒庚　遊邑庠。自甲午以還，府君即感非實學不足以岡有。乃毅然棄舉業從西人傳　雅習數學，發憤忘餐，夜以繼日，不數年，舉凡算術，代數，幾何，三角微積分之奧竅，盡得其傳，並嘗以圖表方式，釋演珠算口訣原理，衷然成帙，辛丑，吳公懷疚，　創設務本女熟於滬南，與府君謀，時風氣未開，多所掣肘，府君力排衆議，始得成立，開我國女學之先河。而蠶桑女校，中國公學，龍門師範等學校，亦爭聘府君為敎授。並於課餘兼任中國圖書公司編輯，藉度敎化，民國成立後，又長江蘇省立第二女子師範，旋長上海縣立務本女子中學校，兼任省立第二師範學校敎職，而以務本女校為最久。蓋府君以為女敎乃國民敎育之母，致力女子敎育，即所以培國本，故任勞任怨，雖或處境拂逆，亦心神怡然。府君工書，宗雨石門，尤精鐘鼎，擅篆刻，喜畫閑竹，愛　幽雅而秀勁，公餘揮　自如，求者輒應，有賑災助學欲徵集　畫者，雖祁寒盛暑弗却也。晚歲　史公置才之聘，任申報　稽核主任職，忠誠　　，風雨無間，二十餘年如　日。中華民國卅三年二月入日午刻退食，自館臨行，與同事歡談如常，抵家時猶與鄰人道寒喧，入室茹小帽，談花生十數內心部，為生平所未有，如是呼痛者三，呼吸漸促，迨咖啡持至，已不能自吸，俄而一暝不視。府君體質康强，精神　鑠，居恒養生有道，素鮮疾病，更蔫信佛學，黎明即起，洽課必敬必誠，此豈克邀佛眷而往生凈土者耶！</p>

<h3>增產年所不宜有的</h3>
<p>今年既然是「增產年」，而其命名是出於政府最高賞局，那末，一言出」就該「令行」，方始可以毋悖較時施政的精神，毋負戰時民情的期望，如果啻出非似不能令行，而且種種事實的表現，恰正與政府的功令處處居於矛盾的地位，其後果眞要令人不堪設想了。</p>
<p>政府為着要增產，所以，凡足成為增產大道中之障碍者，必须予以剷除。增產天道中最大的障碍，莫如生產資金的汎濫而不能集中，「所以在農曆新年以前，財政當局即首先以審愼放款為本市銀錢界之訓，其用意即在於防制農曆新年以後的囤積投機，可是，自從農曆新年到現在，囤積投機之不足，甚至還由一部份齦錢界的敗類自己去參加囤積，美其名曰緊縮放款，實際上還有所謂放款的黑市，結果，演成物資奇缺，物價飛騰的局面，甚至弄得大家舍本逐末，把代表一般公司行號的產　證券賣出，以充囤貨的資金，終至演成戰時產業證券一蹶不振的奇突現象，也就是戰時各國所無而為中國所僅有的一個現象。這樣一個現象是我們增產年所不宜有的，因為華股市場的向榮，乃為國家產業發展的重要條件，恐怕是無人可以否認的。</p>
<p>我們既然是反對股票投機者，當然不能同情於股票的瘋狂世界　瘋狂的暴漲或瘋狂的暴跌，因為暴漲與暴跌，都是出於人為的，同一為投機行為的濫觴，其足影響整個的戰時金融，至深且鉅。我們鑒於昨傳當局對於此次股票投機拋空份子，將加澈查，所以特地發表這點意見。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>風波（三）</p>
<p>提起會餐，從產夫家裹也來了一個歸省中務請光臨一叙的柬帖，但是眞人總不大高典去。在初人二中那年的神武天皇節的日子，被招待午餐時的不適意，還沒有忘却，而且枝子這少女的存在，要使自巳特別不痛快的。</p>
<p>在江田島時，一次也沒有想起過的校子，待看到那深藍色的鹿兒島夏天的天塵又在眞人的腦海中浮泛起來了。</p>
<p>（的確是一個奇怪的少女）</p>
<p>歸省從頭一次訪問隆夫時，不凑巧她和哥哥隆夫一同在書齊裏，那時候她條地站起來，到裘屋去了。那時候她的顏色，那柿傍若無人的態度，好像作戲的假面具用永氷出來似的，一種不可形容的超起人的做作。連她哥哥的隆夫，也弄得張目咋舌的。</p>
<p>曾經駡過自己是「卑怯者！」或「自己一人有出息了！」等苛刻的諷刺的她，這次却沈默不語，好像奈良地方的佛像一般的冷靜，實在不知道她究竟是甚麽意思！</p>
<p>不知是甚麽緣故，銅陵着枝子，就要不痛快，所以眞人出席軍人班的會餐時，也沒去邀隆夫。</p>
<p>傍晚，乘着公共汽車到田沛去的時候，依舊是很美麗的景　。從那兒到　津別莊都呌着海岸地帶，在那道傍有好妙處眺望絕佳的小菜館，在這種小菜館，將自己帶來的牛作鍋子吃，是很久就有的風習。　　到這小菜館的二　來一看，軍人班的人差不多都來齊了，萬代問谷與平等也到了。</p>
<p>「呀…」</p>
<p>「喲…」</p>
<p>朋友們都是平素一般的態度，只是眞人，熊澤，小森三人，不但穿着禮服裙子，並且態度也奥衆不同的。眞人閉口鼓腮的微笑着。</p>
<p>吃完了串餅，老大婆將白爈十搬來了，吃完了大盆的餅，還要吃完這山積的牛肉。　　雖然是沒吃酒，而都像吃醉了似的，互相談着母校，海兵，陸土的事情。</p>
<p>「明天競是海軍志願者的體格檢查的日子，受考者，要多吃點兒牛肉，以壯精力哪！」個人這樣說起，一同都哄堂大笑起來。隆夫倒很認眞的，將筷子伸到鍋子裏去。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>那天眞人因為送米，沒有工夫，所以白天沒去會隆夫。猶其是檢騐體格，雖想着去鼓勵他，也沒有甚麽方法。</p>
<p>可是對那結果，倒很掛心的。幸而成為問題的第一天的檢驗，隆夫是安然的及格了。實際上經理學校和兵學校不同，輕的近視眼是可以錄取的。若是通過這個難關，今天第二天的檢騐內臟及其他，也可以予斷是不成問題的。並且昨夜隆夫的喜悅，好像是一步登天，有已經入經理學校了的形勢。實際說起來，學校的成績隆夫是在眞人以上的，所以對學科考試有自信也不是沒有理由的。</p>
<p>因為如此，所以　人雖心中想着，市也沒有到檢驗塲的母校講堂去的意思。</p>
<p>一回來的時候，請到我家來一趙」。隆夫自己也這樣地說過！</p>
<p>一個炎熱的天氣。從海面上雖時有輕風吹來，但是鹿兒島的蒸晒，又是特別厲害的。</p>
<p>眞人送米叵來，在井邊上，只穿着一儲　相，在擦着汗。這時候北子喊他來了。</p>
<p>「眞人哪，朋友找你來了！」</p>
<p>穿着二中的夏服，東山及其他七入個人軍人組的朋友們，都是勇敢百倍的，擺成一列的在店舖門口站立着。</p>
<p>「呀，恭喜！」</p>
<p>眞人是從心裏浮泛克喜　的　顏。　　「谷君！在十二月裏有學科考試。檢　體格，多　都有自信的。」</p>

<h3>改善配給機構的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 振强</p>
<p>我國之實施配給制度，本由於戰後物價狂漲所促成，然而經過之時間雖短，但弊端却已百出，民衆因配給所受之痛苦，絕非始料之所及。筆者認為改善民生，安定物價，雖必須從普遍配給人手，唯設使配給機構不健全，則配給將無合理可言。因是特提出澈底改善配給機構幾點意見：</p>
<p>第一，調整配給機構加强配給權力，古語云：工欲善其事，必先利其器。過去之配給機關，於量上未免重複過度，即以卜海一地而論。只米糧配給機關已不下四五比位互卸責任，終至鬧得一團糟，而直接蒙受痛苦者，即為一班市民矣。所以筆者以為調整配給機構，先须統一配給組織，絕對避免車複，然後事權才能集中，運用才能靈活，辦事才能專責，而配給方能有改善之望。然配給機構中之人事問題，亦絕不可忽視，中國向來就只有人治而無法治，以致一切法律，等於具文。所以欲求配給機　完美，對於機構內之工作人員，非有守法尊法之精神不可，而欲使工作人員守法尊法，最低之條件，必使工作人員生活有所保陣，然後再對犯法人員，處以嚴罰，使彼等不敢為非犯法。而後之配給才有台理之可能。</p>
<p>第二，配給機構之經費，須於國府支出預算中撥予，目下之商統會。棉統會，米統會等統制配給機關，皆類似乎民衆之自治機關，雖鍛初經費，由國府命令先向中央儲備銀行挪借，究竟每一統制分配機關、實際所需經費多少，採辦資本若干，並無明文規定，統制會本身，旣無生產，又無固定經費，所需之日常費用，又不可免，勢必於採辦與分配之過程中，稍加利潤之故，將留一予職員以舞營營私之機會，使上層無法控制下級，苛如是即使有再健全之配給機構，也將功虧一簣。所以筆者以為配給機構之經費，必須由國府支出，因統制配給機關，乃政府安定民生政策之十，由國府支出經常費用，使配給統制機關，不至之境。</p>
<p>第三，統制配給機關，必須按期公佈收買數量，配給數量，於治本上固須實行上列二點，於治標不可。因中國各機關，積弊已深，而一巨大之機構中，不免參入一二腐化份子，若於事前不想根本杜絕洗弊之方，則事後懲罰，將不無過遲之感。</p>
<p>第四，政府委派專員監督。雖然統制配給機構工作情形，按期向民衆公佈。唯若無負責監督者，則對統制配給機構中工作人員，一旦虛偽報吿，民衆既無權查閱進出帳簿，何從能知公報是否確實所以不能不有公正之監督人員，從旁督導方不致所謂公報者徒成欺人之具文。至於監督人員，政府不妨暫以現任監察院之監察委員充任。一方面可省國府開支，避免另立名目。</p>
<p>第五，配給量須以每人實際量低限度之消費量為準。過去每一配給機關所實施之配給量皆不能適合民衆之實際消費量，尤其米糧等日常必需品，不足之數過鉅”迫使民衆不得不向黑市購買。所以對於配給址應視民衆最低限度之消費多少而定，才能激底消滅黑市，達到安定民生抑低物價之目的。</p>

        <h1>1944.03.07</h1>
<h3>Can't Wait</h3>
<p>Time is the most important factor in life, and agility is the only key to success. This is true in peacetime and wartime, both at the front and in the rear.</p>
<p>Napoleon said after the Battle of Austerlitz that he was able to defeat the Austrian army because it did not understand the value of "five minutes." Missing a minute gave "misfortune" an extra opportunity to seize. Because one side was behind in time, it allowed the other side to take the lead. War is like playing chess, sometimes "one wrong move can lead to the loss of the whole game."</p>
<p>We often say to seize the present and strive in the present, with the intention of telling everyone not to fantasize about the past or the future. Firstly, because fantasizing is useless, and the result of fantasizing is only to delay action, and the result of delaying action is messing things up. Secondly, the past creates causes, the present bears the consequences, and the present creates causes, which will be the consequences of the future. We hope that the country and society will reap good results in the future, so we must sow good seeds now. Our job is to sow seeds, and fantasizing is useless. As the saying goes, "The ancestors plant trees so that future generations can enjoy the shade." This is the true spirit of sustaining the country and the nation. Anyone who hopes that their descendants will be able to enjoy the shade in the future must work hard to plant trees now.</p>
<p>Striving in the present is a matter of practice, not just empty talk. If you talk about good ideals and good plans every day, but you don't have the courage to realize them, and you don't have the courage to execute them, then your ideals and plans are in vain. Furthermore, if you miss a moment, miss an opportunity, then good ideals and good plans have to be revised and adapted to the environment when they are implemented, so that they can be implemented more conveniently. Again, and most importantly, missing an opportunity may mean you will never have the chance to realize your good ideals or execute your good plans. Therefore, striving in the present must be done immediately, it cannot wait.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is a competition between countries, it's a relay race. On the racetrack, when you receive the baton, you must run forward immediately, you can't wait even a second, and you must run to the second station and hand the baton to someone else before you can rest. If you are running to the finish line, you must go all out, be brave and go forward, and you cannot relax one step until you reach the finish line. This year is the year of the decisive battle, it is precisely the time when everyone is running towards the finish line. The people of every country have already received the baton, and the government authorities are the first to receive it. They must lead a group of "national relay runners" towards the destination. Whoever reaches the finish line first wins. At a critical moment, you can't wait even a second, and you can't stop even one step. If you are a little late, the victory or defeat will be decided, the race will be over, and it will be too late even if you want to run again.</p>
<p>In this Greater East Asia War, China's fate is the best, because in this Greater East Asia race team, our ally Japan, the best athlete, is our vanguard, and has already taken the lead by many steps on the track, forcing the other side to spend a lot of effort to catch up. Because our ally's efforts have saved us a lot of energy and a lot of time. This is our good opportunity. Now we are approaching the finish line. Our ally Japan's efforts will enable all the athletes to reach the destination. Do we not even have the courage to run the last leg? Do we still have to wait? Are we still going to hold back our teammates?</p>
<p>A person's good opportunity is hard to come by, and a country's good opportunity is even rarer. It is most important to seize the opportunity and work hard. "Don't wait idly, turning your young head white, only to grieve in vain." We would like to offer Yue Wumu's words to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>British Army Suffers Heavy Blow, Attempt to Invade Burma Foiled; Japanese Army Achieves Great War Results in Mopping-Up Operations</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Burma front, 6th: Since the Japanese army on the Burma-India front launched an annihilation battle to reduce the strength of the British 7th Division that had invaded in front of Buthidaung, after breaking through the enemy's position on the banks of the Mayu River on February 4th, it took only twenty days to encircle the remnants of the enemy's main force in the Sinzwea basin and launch a mopping-up operation, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. To date, the Japanese army has achieved extremely significant war results, including 7,000 enemy corpses (of which at least about 3,000 were British), 600 enemy prisoners, and a large number of Indian soldiers joining the Indian National Army. In addition, 10 enemy rapid-fire guns, 11 mortars, 96 heavy and light machine guns, as well as automatic rifles, pistol ammunition, clothing, horses, etc. were captured incalculable. Moreover, 21 10mm cannons and 15mm howitzers, 20 howitzers, 6 anti-aircraft guns, 45 tanks, 660 trucks, 17 boats, and a large amount of other military supplies were destroyed. According to this statistic, it only reflects what was confirmed by the Japanese army during the war. In addition, the number of enemy corpses and abandoned weapons not recovered by the Japanese army is often very large, so the actual enemy losses are bound to be greater than this. The results of this battle are comparable to the results obtained in the Arakan campaign last spring in terms of spoils of war. The number of enemy corpses is 1,800 more than in the previous Arakan campaign, and the number of prisoners has increased by 14. The situation encountered by the British 7th Division is somewhat similar to that encountered by the British-Indian 14th Division in the previous Arakan campaign. If the confirmed enemy damage is included, then the extent of the losses of the British 7th Division is even greater. The rout of the British 7th Division has dashed the enemy's attempt to counterattack Burma. At the same time, the tragic defeat suffered by the enemy this time makes it impossible for them to recover in the short term.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – A certain base on the Arakan front: The Indian National Army is fighting alongside the Japanese army to win independence for their motherland, and their activities on the Arakan front have attracted much attention. The Indian National Army either charges at the British army with guns in hand, or endures the pain of shooting at their compatriots rushing towards the Japanese army's positions. In the Sinzwea basin battle, a unit of the Indian National Army, working with the Japanese army, circled to the rear of the enemy and cut off their retreat. They blew up the enemy's airfield north of Ngakyedauk and fiercely attacked the nearby enemy, capturing a large number of important secret documents. On the evening of the 17th, they made contact with the Japanese army, occupied the enemy's outpost six kilometers north of Ngakyedauk, and routed the enemy's motor vehicle unit. Recently, the army has assisted the Japanese army in undertaking the task of cutting off the retreat of the enemy on the front line, launching night attacks with the Japanese army and charging into the enemy's positions with bayonets, annihilating them. In short, the soldiers of the Indian National Army are continuing to strive for the independence of their motherland, and are adding a glorious page to the new history of a free India.</p>
<h3>Breakdown of Chongqing-Communist Negotiations; Serious Disputes Arise; Chongqing Believes the Communist Reductions Are Too Harsh</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Chongqing-Communist dispute is becoming increasingly serious, and tensions are mounting. Recently, according to relevant authorities in this city, news of the Chongqing-Communist dispute has been obtained. This matter was published in the mouthpiece newspaper of the American Republican Party on the 5th of this month, which stated that Chongqing will announce the activities of the Chinese Communists at the Cairo Conference on New Year's Eve, which is not a good sign for China. Chiang himself believes that this situation is related to Chongqing's Soviet diplomacy, which further increased Chiang's unease, and he complained to US President Roosevelt. At the same time, the Chongqing side nominally listened to the advice of Britain and the United States and, in order to avoid a full-scale civil war, planned to seek a political solution to resolve the dispute. On January 4th of this year, special personnel were dispatched to Xi'an to negotiate with representatives of the Communist Party. At that time, the Communist Party put forward many conditions, including political, economic, cultural, and military issues. The Chongqing representatives believed that the conditions put forward by the Communist Party were too harsh and were greatly dissatisfied. The Chongqing representatives, He Yaobu and Shang Zhen, returned to Chongqing and resigned from their posts as representatives. They then made a statement to the Ta Kung Pao reporters, saying that the conditions put forward by Yan'an were intended to seize power under the guise of a united front. Especially in the military field, their ambition was evident. The Chongqing side would naturally not tolerate such an attitude from the Communist Party and refused to negotiate with them. They also said that this breakdown was the result of the Communist Party's lack of sincerity. Subsequently, the Communist Party also issued a statement, in which Chen Shaoyu spoke to reporters from TASS and the Associated Press, claiming that the Chongqing side had always been evasive and lacked concrete expressions, so they had to strive for a common goal and demand that Chongqing reflect. After the breakdown of the Chongqing-Communist negotiations, the Chongqing side immediately sent troops to surround Yan'an. It is said that three divisions of Hu Zongnan's troops were advancing from Xi'an, and two divisions of Fu Zuoyi's troops were pushing towards Wuyuan. In addition, three divisions were also surrounding Yulin. After the breakdown of the negotiations, the armies of both sides were in a state of confrontation, which was extremely serious. Inspections from Xi'an to Yan'an were very strict, as a countermeasure to block Yan'an. Therefore, the serious conflict between Chongqing and the Communists that occurred last August is about to happen again at the bottom.</p>
<h3>General Sends Personnel to Pay Respects to Chiang's Mother's Grave</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Since Chiang Kai-shek's blind resistance against Japan has failed, his greatest distress is that he cannot pay respects to his late mother's grave in his hometown. General [Shunroku] Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, out of his deep samurai spirit, specially ordered the chief of the Political Trust Corps to pay respects at the end of last year. After receiving the order, the chief of the corps invited Lieutenant General Zhu Qingchuan of the National Government Army to the enemy-occupied Xikou Town, Fenghua County, Chiang's hometown. Xikou Town is located in the area closest to the Chongqing army. Many relatives attended the ceremony, including Chiang's nephew Wang Yiguo, and even a certain Buddhist monk, a cousin of Chiang who had already become a monk. In addition to offering a large wreath as a sacrificial offering, Commander-in-Chief Hata also left monks to chant scriptures in front of the grave for seven days. Chiang's relatives and friends were deeply grateful for the Japanese military authorities' generosity and kindness.</p>
<h3>Mountbatten's Poor Command</h3>
<p>Subject to Criticism from the US</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Haisheng News Agency reports that a US source said that a Washington official criticized Mountbatten's India-Burma campaign for not achieving any major success, only taking a defensive posture instead of an offensive one. The Japanese army controls the waterways in the area, and Britain has no hope of hindering their transport.</p>
<h3>Filipino Religious Followers Support the Government</h3>
<p>Manila, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – In order to establish the foundation of the Philippine Republic, various religious groups in the country, such as Catholics and Protestants, have unanimously resolved to fully support the Laurel government. The Aglipayan Church, the Philippine Independent Church with 1.5 million followers, held a national representative conference and decided on the 2nd to support the policies of the Laurel government. Therefore, the system of cooperation between all Filipino Christians and the government is becoming more solid. After the religious groups and the government are integrated, they will make a great contribution to the promotion of various constructions in the new country.</p>
<h3>Grand Celebration of the Prophet Muhammad's Birthday in Syonan</h3>
<p>Syonan, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – Today is the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad. All households here are flying both the Islamic flag and the Japanese flag to show their congratulations. The general Muslim population is celebrating this day with sincere reverence. This morning, about a thousand male Muslims gathered in two groups at Kay Guan Road and Malacca Road. At 10:00 a.m., they marched in formation, waving the Islamic flag and the Japanese flag with both hands, singing hymns. At 11:30 a.m., they entered the mosque to pray and wish the Greater East Asia War victory for Japan. After the prayers, they went to the Islamic Malay School to rest. A fast-breaking ceremony was held at 4:00 p.m., which was unprecedentedly grand and rare in Syonan after the war.</p>
<h3>Burmese Cabinet Approves Next Year's Budget; Will Increase Taxes and Purchase Rice</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The Burmese government approved next year's budget at the cabinet meeting on the 4th, and passed the government's original proposal. After it is decided by the Privy Council, it will be formally decided soon. According to the budget proposal, the revenue is 69 million rupees, and the expenditure is 281 million rupees. The difference of 212 million rupees will be borrowed from the Bank of Burma to make up the deficit. The expenditure includes a special accounting of 17 million rupees for rice purchase funds. Compared with the current budget decided last October, the above budget proposal has an increase of 27 million rupees in revenue and an increase of 94 million rupees in expenditure. When compiling the next year's budget proposal, the Burmese government placed special emphasis on expanding national defense and security, as well as assisting Japan in various aspects. In terms of revenue, it is planned to raise the income tax by a certain amount, and special changes will also be made to the existing profit tax and other systems. The planned amount of revenue will be maintained within the possible limits of the existing institutions, and a reserve fund will be added to the Ministry of Finance's budget to give it flexibility when implementing the budget. As for the rice purchase funds, they are actually reduced compared with last year, and it has been decided to combine the temporary rice purchase expenses for this fiscal year with the new budget as funds for purchasing rice. This plan will greatly contribute to the self-sufficiency of rice.</p>
<h3>A General Overview of the European War Situation</h3>
<p>The Soviet offensive on the military front is gradually reaching its climax. The Red Army, which initially began its attack in the southern Ukrainian region, has failed to capture the areas within the bend of the Dnieper River in one fell swoop. As for the central front, the thrust towards the Romanian border, although it broke through some points of the old Polish border in early January, was thwarted by German resistance, and the offensive was defeated. From this point on, the main battlefield on the eastern front shifted to the northern region from Leningrad to Lake Ilmen and Peipus. Its vanguard has already reached the Estonian border and is currently engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>This serious situation on the eastern front is related to the Anglo-American attempts to land in Europe, and even to the trends of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, close attention must be paid to the future movements of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Limits of the Red Army's Advance</p>
<p>Will the Red Army take advantage of its momentum and continue to advance? The Soviet Union's position:</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has repeatedly declared that it is a defensive war.</p>
<p>It has been carrying out unprofitable wars for the past two and a half years, and is therefore unable to pursue the German army, and this is not a good strategy for the Soviet Union itself.</p>
<p>Instead of exhausting all its strength to completely defeat Germany, it is better to continuously strive to strengthen its national power in order to prepare for dealing with Britain and the United States in the future.</p>
<p>Conversely, when Germany's existence no longer poses a major threat to the Soviet Union at a certain time, it must preserve Germany's existence. Britain and the United States do not want the Soviet Union to have a monopoly in the southern Balkans, the three Baltic countries in the north, and Northern Europe.</p>
<p>Benefits of Shortening the Front</p>
<p>Looking at it from the German side, the German army has regarded the loss of each city and town as an accident. Since last year, according to the grand operational plan, it has reorganized the front line and completed the most advantageous posture. The retreat operation has come to an end. If the Soviet Union continues to pursue, it will be welcomed by Germany. Just as the anti-Axis forces in Southern Europe are making empty promises of landing without actually doing so, the Soviet Union may not necessarily want to engage in a decisive battle. Although everyone wants to exert their full strength and resolve the situation in one fell swoop with a decisive battle, the situation is too complex and there are too many future problems that are difficult to resolve.</p>
<p>Strategies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>From this perspective, the heavy pressure on the eastern front is only a threat on the map, and the key lies in the enemy's strategy of politically exploiting this situation. The first is the possibility of a new situation in the German-Soviet and German-British relations that is widely rumored in neutral countries. The second is the political situation in the southern Balkan countries, the three Baltic countries in the north, and Finland. The former is the strategy of Britain and the United States towards Bulgaria and Romania; the latter is the Soviet Union's strategy to politically compensate for its military weaknesses. However, the Balkan countries realize that there is no way to survive except by being united with Germany. Finland also criticizes the Soviet Union's new measures as merely wanting to gain more voting points in future international negotiations. What freedom, liberation, and respect for independence are just a disguised form of aggressive domination.</p>
<p>Offensive Against Neutral Countries</p>
<p>Echoing these Soviet political activities is the advance of the Anglo-American "offensive against neutral countries" and the bombing of Germany. That is, Britain and the United States, taking advantage of the momentum of pressuring Argentina, are attacking Spain and Portugal, and are active in Turkey and Sweden, planning to pull these countries over to the anti-Axis side. The reasons for this are:</p>
<p>1. Britain and the United States do not yet have the strength to launch a decisive second front in Europe.</p>
<p>2. Weakening Germany's war potential through air strikes, on the one hand, is to accommodate the Soviet Union's demands, and on the other hand, it is to exert retaliatory power.</p>
<p>3. The comprehensive strengthening of air strikes leads people to believe that the Anglo-American army's landing in Europe will begin.</p>
<p>4. Taking advantage of the lending background, before forming a decisive second front, in order to shape its political position and to supervise the Soviet Union's activities, it is constantly pulling neutral countries over to the anti-Axis side.</p>
<p>The political influence resulting from the new situation on the eastern front is being realized in various forms, but it all depends on the domestic situation in Germany. Today's situation in Germany is that it is fully exerting its strength to strengthen its national power in order to prepare for a future counter-offensive.

<h3>Price of Nanjing Silk Falls</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – The cotton cloth merchants in Nanjing, because the authorities have prohibited the free trading of cotton cloth, have hoarded large quantities of silk and satin in order to manipulate market prices. Affected by this, the market price of silk and satin has gradually risen. However, since the authorities issued a decree allowing the free trading of cotton in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and Nanjing, except for Shanghai, people's morale has been low, and the market price of silk and satin has fallen. All the hoarders are anxious, truly what is called reaping what you sow.</p>

<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army Air Force over New Guinea; Eleven Enemy Aircraft Destroyed in Attack on Wewak</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – There was an intense air battle on the New Guinea front today. The Army Air Force ambushed enemy aircraft attacking Ankrah, 80 kilometers south of Wewak, at 9:00 a.m. on the 4th. Fifty Type 100 fighters shot down eleven of them, and the enemy aircraft were defeated and returned immediately. Again, at 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon, Japanese aircraft bombed the enemy's Marawah airfield and engaged in an aerial battle with enemy fighters, shooting down one P-41. They also repeatedly bombed enemy aircraft within the parking lot. One enemy small aircraft caught fire, and fifteen medium and small enemy aircraft were damaged. Two Japanese aircraft did not return to their original bases in the battle.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Axis Is Also Deeply Impressed by the Japanese Military's Strategy in the South Pacific</h3>
<p>Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a British weekly magazine's discussion of the overview of the Japanese military's counterattack in the Pacific: Considering the facts, it can be known that the Japanese military is invincible when attacking. When engaged in defensive warfare, it is also equally awe-inspiring. Moreover, the strategy of the Japanese military's supreme command is completely different from that of the military authorities of Western European countries. Although they sometimes shift their positions to shorten the front line, or retreat from difficult-to-defend areas, or transfer due to lack of food and supplies, they will never surrender as a result. The anti-Axis forces mostly expected the Japanese troops in Lae, Finschhafen, and Bougainville in New Guinea to be in a desperate predicament, but the blows they suffered when the anti-Axis forces attacked Lae and Finschhafen were indeed beyond their expectations.</p>

<h3>### Chongqing Legal Tender Plummets - Recorded by Guilin Ta Kung Pao</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing has lost free foreign exchange markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong, and the legal tender market has plummeted. Later, the excessive use of US dollars by the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing further lowered the value of the legal tender, causing prices to soar. According to the recent Guilin Ta Kung Pao sent here, it stated the actual situation and pointed out the incompetence of the Chongqing authorities. The general idea is: In the past, the official exchange rate of legal tender to the US dollar was 20 yuan to 1 US dollar, but the Ministry of Finance, starting from January of this year, implemented a revised method, stipulating 40 yuan of legal tender to 1 US dollar, considering it a method of yielding to the US. But in reality, the black market price of the US dollar in Guilin recently is about 120 yuan per dollar, and in Kunming, it is more than 150 yuan, equivalent to six to seven times the official price, or three to four times the revised market price. According to the Chongqing Municipal Government's published commodity price index for the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the average is 253 times that before the war. The purchasing power of the legal tender has plummeted to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of what it was before the war. In Guilin, the minimum monthly living expenses per person require 2,000 yuan. This explains the failure of the authorities' foreign exchange policy using the US dollar.</p>

At the same time, the name of the County Administration Personnel Training Institute will be changed to County Magistrate Training Institute.</p>
<h3>Regarding the Pacific Theater, British and American Opinions Diverge - The Military Employs the Wonders of Interior Operations</h3>
<p>The nature of the American so-called "general counteroffensive against Japan" is to disregard the enormous sacrifices of one country, relying only on the quantitative advantage of its materials to promote "island-hopping warfare." However, the military commentator of the London Observer wrote in the newspaper:</p>
<p>The war resources of the anti-Axis alliance are not unlimited. Therefore, large-scale operations such as the current anti-Axis military's significant sacrifices in the Pacific will gradually deplete the anti-Axis alliance's resources and immediately affect the European theater, inflicting a significant blow on the anti-Axis military's operations against Germany.</p>
<p>The reporter also pointed out that the anti-Axis side's operational plans, whether for the war against Germany or the war against Japan, should be closely coordinated. However, when the United States conducted this large-scale war, it did not communicate with the British side in advance, so the British side expressed deep dissatisfaction. Furthermore, the United States has no "end game" in its war against Japan, and the British side is deeply concerned about the American war against Japan. The gist of his argument is as follows:</p>
<p>Covering the vast amount of ships for two divisions</p>
<p>We, the British, cannot regard the American war against Japan as insignificant. This can be understood by considering how the United States used a large number of ships in the landing operation on the Marshall Islands. That is, the amount of ships participating in the attack on the Marshall Islands could at least transport twenty US army divisions to Europe. During the North African campaign of the anti-Axis military, what efforts did we make to turn North Africa, only 150 miles from the European continent, into a springboard for operations against Europe? We spent several months of concentrated effort in forming the assault fleet used in the North African and Italian operations.</p>
<p>In order to turn the Marshall Islands into a springboard for operations against Truk Island, 1,300 miles away, and Guam, 1,800 miles away, what kind of effort and material resources should the anti-Axis side pay? That is far beyond what North Africa could be compared to. To transport the forces of two divisions and the materials they need to a location 3,000 miles from the base requires 2 million tons of cargo ships, and these ships themselves must also be supplied. Therefore, forward bases must be gradually built in preparation for the second step of the action. The vastness of the cargo ships needed to transport the materials is truly astounding. The amount of ships needed for operations in Europe is insignificant compared to the amount of ships needed for operations in the Marshall Islands. Moreover, the American troops who landed in the Marshall Islands are not enough to attack the most important base of the Japanese army in the Pacific, so more troops and more transport ships are needed. This demand for ships has shocked even the American shipbuilding tycoon Henry Kaiser.</p>
<p>Two-Front Warfare Without Prior Understanding</p>
<p>During the Quebec conference, the American side did not declare this scale of Pacific operations, and the anti-Axis side will feel surprised if the United States continues to do so in the future. The most difficult problem facing the anti-Axis side is the Second Front, but the Pacific operations are even more difficult than this. The assets and the spirit of sacrifice of the anti-Axis allies must be put to an even more terrible test. The current stage of the Pacific war resembles the Eastern Front. The places we reach are all Japanese bases. Spread across the entire Pacific, forming a deep battle line. Attacking the Marshall Islands is only the first test. Moreover, Japan still has many people who can be mobilized as soldiers and used as military supply workers, and its military strength is still extremely strong. The navy has almost maintained the same strength as it did at the start of the Greater East Asia War, and there are no signs of any decline in the strength of the army and navy air forces.</p>
<p>The Japanese Military's Strategic Posture is Solid</p>
<p>The military commentator of the Swedish capital's Dagens Nyheter also expressed the same view as follows:</p>
<p>Even if a decisive battle between Japan and the United States is inevitable in the future, Japan will seize the most favorable time to concentrate its fleet on the favorable waters near its central base for combat. Therefore, no matter how much the American navy boasts about its material superiority, "it is impossible to counter the Japanese military's advantageous strategic position." The Japanese military, which has shifted from an offensive to a defensive posture, is inflicting great damage on the American military through the resistance of small garrisons and small fleets, ambushing the American military's advance everywhere - the so-called bleeding tactics. Even if the American military obtains local victories, the large-scale American operations against Japan in the air seem to focus more on the central offensive route to the bases that Japan considers far away. However, the southwestern Pacific operations that correspond to this and are most desired by the United States have not been realized due to the Japanese military's strengthened defenses. Therefore, the Japanese military is employing the wonders of interior operations and has a chance of achieving piecemeal victories. Therefore, the future of the Pacific war is worth paying attention to. - (Zhi: Translated from the February 15th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<h3>Fighting on the Old Polish Border - Soviet Union Deploys Fourteen Infantry Divisions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet attack on Shepetovka was anticipated by the German Command. Recently, German aircraft repeatedly bombed Soviet troop concentrations, inflicting heavy damage. However, the Soviets still attacked with approximately twelve to fourteen infantry divisions and three tank units, creating several gaps in the German lines. The intensity of the fighting is rare on the Eastern Front. Shepetovka is located on the Berdichev to Rovno railway line, suitably south of the Soviet fortified triangle of Lutsk, Rovno, and Dubno. The Soviet objective is not yet known, whether it is related to the fighting south of Krivoy Rog, or hard to say. The Eastern Front is unchanged except for Shepetovka. Fighting is more intense in the areas of Vitebsk, Narva, and Pskov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Soviet army penetrated the German defense line to a width of four kilometers. In order to conserve forces, the Germans retreated to positions under artillery cover.</p>
<p>Intense Fighting on Both North and South Routes</p>
<p>The Soviet's second offensive focus is between Lake Peipus and Finland, with the aim of returning the three Baltic states to its sphere of influence. On the other hand, they also want Finland to accept a truce at any cost. The Soviet army wants to capture the Narva passage in order to occupy the Finnish Baltic coast. South of Krivoy Rog, more reinforcements were sent into the breach created in the previous few days, launching fierce attacks all day. The Soviet army widened its breach by several hundred meters, but its breakthrough attempt ultimately failed.</p>
<p>German Air Force Active on Eastern Front Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) German military circles announced: The German Air Force was active on the Eastern Front on Saturday, despite poor weather conditions, bombing Soviet convoys and tanks, and areas where forward units were deployed. At Zhitomir, German aircraft destroyed Soviet artillery, silencing them. Between Lake Peipus and Finland, German aircraft bombed enemy fortifications and destroyed many of their artillery pieces.</p>
<h3>German Forces in Southern Italy Gain Ground in Surprise Attack</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) German News Agency reports: On the 4th, German shock troops heavily damaged American positions in surprise attacks west of Minturno, north of Castelforte, and in the Apennine Mountains. In this operation, German forces captured 83 enemy soldiers and seized a large number of small arms and eight mortars. There was no heavy fighting at the Nettuno bridgehead. German long-range artillery shelled the Allied supply routes and the ports of Nettuno and Anzio.</p>
<h3>British Mosquito Bombers Raid Western Germany</h3>
<p>Forty-one Shot Down</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The US Air Force announced on the 5th: US Air Force Mosquito bomber squadrons bombed Berlin and western Germany on the night of the 4th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German Fuhrer's headquarters announced: American bomber squadrons carried out terror bombings on western Germany throughout the 4th. The damage to residential areas and civilian casualties were most severe in Cologne and Bonn. Several churches, hospitals, and public buildings were also hit. A small number of bomber formations, under the protection of fighter escorts, also entered the Berlin area. Because the German Air Force was extremely active, the American aircraft were unable to concentrate their bombing. As a result, 41 were shot down, including 21 four-engine bombers.</p>
<h3>Chile Recognizes Argentine Government</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to United Press news obtained in New York: The Chilean government has recognized the Farrell government of Argentina and declared that it considers the Farrell government a continuation of the Ramirez government. According to United Press news from Buenos Aires, several South American governments have notified Washington that they will suffer economic difficulties if they have further disputes with Argentina. Several South American countries have decided to abandon the mutual consultation method, which was initiated to clarify their attitude towards Argentina. The termination of this consultation method may also lead to a reconsideration of the attitude towards Bolivia. The South American governments have notified Washington that the refusal to recognize the new government of Bolivia lacks practical effect.</p>
<p>Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to a United Press correspondent stationed in the capital of Uruguay: Uruguay and Paraguay are prepared to follow Chile and Bolivia in recognizing the new Argentine government. This move may create a rift in Pan-American common relations and lead to the formation of a South American bloc led by Argentina.</p>
<p>Argentina Implements Measures to Ensure Domestic Security</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Reuters news, Argentine new government leader Farrell will declare at a reception: The Argentine government is determined to eradicate all elements within the country that could endanger the security of the continent. He will not rest until every trace of espionage is completely eliminated. Justice and the information possessed by Argentines lead Argentines to believe that Argentina plays an important role in the cooperation of the continent. Regarding the question of whether Argentina will strengthen cooperation with the countries of the Americas, Farrell said that the situation remains the same. Argentina supplies its sister countries with food and raw materials, which is enough to help solve their problems; otherwise, they will fall into difficult circumstances. If the situation returns to normal, the military leaders will hand over political power to the representatives of the people. He hopes this will be realized soon.</p>
<p>American Actions Do Not Consistitute an Ultimatum</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports: The severance of diplomatic relations between the US and Argentina is justified by the pretext of a German threat to the Western Hemisphere. The countries of the Americas unanimously recognize that the United States' "good neighbor" policy is merely a demand for unconditional surrender to American political and economic dictatorship. The economic prosperity that Argentina currently enjoys is entirely due to its policy of neutrality, but this conflicts with Washington's plans. Therefore, the United States is threatening Argentina with the blockade of the Rio de la Plata estuary, in order to force Argentina to sever relations with the Axis powers, and recently it has even wanted to make Argentina a member of the Allies. The propaganda war and psychological warfare launched by Washington, with their slogans of democratic principles and public interests, are forcing Argentina to surrender. The United States is now violating the Atlantic Charter, which is even worse than Churchill's recent speech.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Replaces Commander on Ukrainian Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports: According to the Soviet Information Bureau, Stalin appointed General Su-ko-fu as the commander, because General F-u was dismissed due to illness.</p>
<h3>German-American Exchange of Nationals</h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) Former German Consul-General in Algiers, Pfeffer, and consular staff, along with 650 German nationals from North, Central, and South America, arrived in the city of Zabrzeg yesterday on a special train. This group of Germans were exchanged for Americans in Germany and its occupied territories in Lisbon a few days ago.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Swedish ship Gripsholm, carrying 373 American prisoners of war, set sail for America from Lisbon today.</p>
<h3>Military Exercises Held on Western Swedish Border - Diplomatic Support Depends on Military Strength</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports: Swedish troops are currently holding military exercises in the western province of Dalsland, near the Norwegian border. The fundamental significance of this move is to defend against aggression from Norway. This morning's newspaper said that Sweden has repeatedly held similar exercises in the past few years, but they were all done in secret.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Hai Tong News Agency: Swedish Defense Minister Sköld gave a speech, forcefully arguing for the necessity of Swedish military preparations. He revealed that Sweden spends 6 million kronor per day on military preparations. The minister also said that the military is a prerequisite for foreign policy, so the foreign minister should know the power of the military as a support for diplomacy. The expansion of Swedish military power enables the country to implement a more forceful policy, but maintaining military preparations requires spending money and sacrificing other items of expenditure.</p>
<h3>Maintaining Territorial Integrity - Bulgaria Determined to Maintain Friendly Relations with Turkey</h3>
<p>Sofia, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency: Bulgarian Minister of Public Works Vassilev gave a speech at a mass meeting in the Black Sea port of Varna yesterday, refuting the Allied demand that Bulgarian troops withdraw from Macedonia and Thrace, saying that this demand is completely contrary to the Atlantic Charter. According to him, both historically and ethnically, Bulgaria should be the master of the two provinces. Since its founding, Bulgaria has regarded the liberation of the two provinces as the goal of its foreign policy. The Atlantic Charter does recognize the principle of national self-determination, but the fact proves that the Atlantic Charter is just President Wilson's old tune. Demanding that Bulgarian troops withdraw from Macedonia and Thrace not only harms Bulgaria's honor but also destroys the work of national liberation. For the prosperity of the Balkans, Bulgaria deeply desires to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries and hopes that the rights of all countries will be respected. Regarding the Allied desire to destroy Bulgaria's unity with air raids, Vassilev claimed: There are no foreigners in Bulgaria, and Bulgaria is determined to maintain national freedom and not allow foreigners to set foot on Bulgarian soil. Regarding relations with Turkey, there has never been a dispute between Bulgaria and Turkey since the Balkan Wars. The two countries are now working together to build a new order in Southeast Europe. The two countries have made considerable efforts in the construction of the railway bridge over the Danube River. The Allied powers are waging psychological warfare against Bulgaria, hoping to change its foreign policy, but Bulgarians do not trust them. Vassilev then briefly discussed the war situation, praising the fighting spirit of the Bulgarian army, saying that the Bulgarian army will fight to the end for the integrity of the country.</p>
<h3>Egypt to Implement Compulsory Military Service</h3>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency, news from Cairo: The Egyptian government is considering implementing a two-year compulsory military service system. The Egyptian Minister of Defense is currently drafting a plan to reorganize and universalize military service, with the term set at two years, while reducing the opportunities for exemption.</p>
<h3>Italian Fascist Party's First Congress</h3>
<p>Milan, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Republican Fascist Party held its first national congress yesterday in the Brescia region, with Army Chief Graziani also in attendance. First, Party Secretary Pavolini gave a speech, reviewing the work of the party's revival over the past six months, carried out under the instructions of party leader Mussolini, and reporting that the party now has 570,000 members, distributed in 1,072 locations. 5,000 party members have joined the newly formed army. Regarding the implementation of social justice and the persons responsible for the betrayal of July 15 of last year, necessary measures have been taken. The party has now purged traitors and unqualified elements.</p>
<h3>Tense Soviet-Polish Relations</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency: "Polska Newspaper", the mouthpiece of the Polish Socialist Party, published a commentary today, proving the tension in Soviet-Polish relations. The newspaper criticized the Soviet Union's foreign policy in stern terms, condemning Moscow for not negotiating the border west of the Curzon Line. The Soviet Union's desires are increasing day by day without end. Poland, wanting to adapt to the Soviet Union's wishes, must sacrifice its independence.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Others Advocate Delaying the Establishment of a Jewish State</h3>
<p>Based on Military Reasons</p>
<p>Geneva, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to the exchange telegrams from Washington: At a closed-door meeting of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall strongly advocated postponing discussion of the bill related to Palestine. Secretary of War Stimson seconded the motion. If the bill is passed, it will result in a request for London to allow Jews to immigrate to Palestine. Based on military reasons, he apparently meant that the current military situation is critical, and the United States should avoid conflict with the Arab nations.</p>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Hai Tong News Agency, news from Jerusalem: "The Palestine Post" said that April 1, stipulated in the 1939 British White Paper, is the date after which, for several weeks, it will lodge protests.</p>
<h3>Unstable Situation in French Morocco</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Jews is intensifying, and its unstable situation has spread throughout the West Asia and has also frequently caused disturbances in French Morocco. According to news from Tangier, in addition to ordering the closure of local higher education institutions on the 5th, the French Committee of National Liberation also arrested all teachers, and therefore, the Arab population's resistance to the authorities' repressive policies is becoming more intense.</p>
<h3>British-Canadian Food Negotiations Reach a Deadlock</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency reports, according to British newspapers: British requests for Canada to continue supplying food have reached a deadlock, but these newspapers are prohibited from explaining the reason. Most British people know that Canada is no longer prepared to supply food to England in the same quantity as before (England's food planting is entirely dependent on Canada's supply), but the reason is not entirely to be obtained in the current food negotiations. The newspapers reported that the focus of the negotiations was on extending the British-Canadian food agreement, and they initially did not expect difficulties to arise suddenly. For example, the Daily Express said that the problem is whether Canada will maintain its export volume according to previous precedents, and how Canada should price its large amount of grains and its political problems, but there were no results. It is widely believed that British-Canadian relations are poor, and for many years Canada has paid less attention to London's leadership.</p>
<h3>US-Mexico Negotiations for Joint Oil Field Development</h3>
<p>Vigo, 6th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: US is actively expanding its foothold in the Mexican oil market. According to reports from Mexico City, US representatives are currently negotiating with Mexican oil experts, seeking a twenty-year cooperation agreement on oil field development policies. While US policy is quite apparent, for publicity purposes, it claims to be implementing an important plan to avoid oil shortages both domestically and internationally after the war.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Implements Labor Service System</h3>

As of March 2nd, all those employed by timber businesses are subject to labor service and cannot leave their workplaces without permission from the state labor bureau.</p>
<h3>Mighty Generals on the German-Soviet Front</h3>
<p>The Soviet Union has concentrated its firepower on the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front, launching a major offensive. Simultaneously, it has begun a counteroffensive in the northwestern region of Lake Ilmen and the northern area of Leningrad. The German-Soviet front extends from the vast plains of the West Orsha Gap, with its icy conditions, through the border of Belarus, the Vitebsk area west of Nevel, the western axis region, the upper reaches of the Velikaya River near the old Polish border, and the southwest of Velikiye Luki to the Krivoy Rog line in Crimea.

The Baltic Front is commanded by General Bagramyan, poised for an advance. On the German side, a large number of mechanized units are deployed, commanded by Field Marshal Küchler, an artillery expert, who launches fierce counterattacks against the Soviet forces.</p>
<p>Central Front</p>
<p>The Soviet forces on the central front are divided into four routes: The First Ukrainian Front is commanded by General Vatutin, who gained fame for recapturing the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Second Ukrainian Front is commanded by General Konev, coordinating with Vatutin's army, attempting to cut off the German army in the Berdychiv area. The Third Ukrainian Front is commanded by General Malinovsky, coordinating with the other two fronts. The Fourth Ukrainian Front is commanded by General Tolbukhin, concentrated on the Southern Bug River, aiming to launch a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine.

<p>Southern Front</p>
<p>The Soviet commander on the southern front is General Yeremenko, launching an offensive from the Crimean Peninsula along the Black Sea towards the German forces. On the German side, the forces are commanded by Field Marshal von Manstein, famous for capturing Sevastopol. Manstein has powerful counterattacks. (From the 26th Daily News)</p>

<h3>Even the Most Beautiful Peony Needs Green Leaves to Support It.</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Commerce and Trade Association recently wrote to Director Yuan of the Rice Management Committee to improve the allocation of household rice rations for residents in this city.

<h3>Security Bureau Detective Team Cracks "Tian Ji" Case Principal Culprit Ling Weide and Accomplice Gu Changfa Arrested</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Recently, cases of child abduction, stripping, and murder have occurred frequently in this city, with extremely cruel and shocking methods. Gu Baolin, captain of the Security Bureau Detective Team, recognizing the serious nature of these robbery and murder cases, organized a special investigation team, sending detectives in all directions, with a deadline to solve the cases. They learned that the abducted children were always led away by people impersonating soldiers, so they focused their efforts on this aspect to uncover the truth. Until the 2nd of this month, detectives at the Great New World amusement park suddenly noticed a suspicious young man wearing military-style clothing</p>
<p>Acting Suspiciously</p>
<p>This aroused the attention of the detectives, who followed him closely. They later learned that the young man lived in a bungalow at 288 Lane, Er'erke Road, and his name was Ling Weide (nickname Shun'gen). They also found that children from the Ruitai Copper and Iron Shop at the entrance of the lane, as well as a child named Da A'er from number 40 in the lane, had disappeared one after another. Then, they were stripped and sent back, making the situation even more suspicious. The detectives determined that the young man was highly likely to be involved and dispatched officers to arrest Ling Weide the next day. After interrogation, he</p>
<p>Confessed Without Denial</p>
<p>He also confessed to his accomplice, Gu Changfa, who lived in Gujiazhai, Xin Hongzhen. The detectives rushed to that location and arrested Gu Changfa, who also confessed without denial. They confessed to luring the children from the Ruitai Copper Shop and Da A'er to a small stream behind the Dongyang Flower Garden Ice Factory on Feihong Road, Hongzhen, stripping off their wool sweaters, and then letting the children go back. Also, an eight-year-old nephew of a Lu surname living at number 20, Renxin Lane, Feihong Road, Hongzhen, was lured to the stream south of a small stone bridge in Beisha Port, Jiangwan, where his wool sweater and pants were stripped off, and the child was</p>
<p>Pushed Into the Stream</p>
<p>After the child was pushed into the stream, he cried loudly. A woman surnamed Ma passed by and called for help, rescuing the child and sending him home. Also, a child surnamed Shi from the cigarette shop opposite the Sanguo Restaurant on Tangshan Road was lured to a stream across from the Dongyang Middle School on Qimei Road, where his wool sweater and pants were stripped off and he was pushed into the stream,</p>
<p>Dying Immediately. In addition, Zhang Hou from Wenguang Primary School on Penglai Road was also taken by Ling to the stream around 2 PM on the 4th, who stripped him and pushed him into the stream. Later, twenty-seven wool sweaters and pants of the victimized schoolchildren were recovered from the Shunfeng Pawnshop on Linping Road. It was discovered that Ling Weide had a resident ID card. The suspect has been handed over to the military law department for investigation and prosecution to seek justice for the victimized families in the city.</p>
<p>At the same time, the families of the victims have been notified to come to the team to identify and claim their clothing. Some families came to claim the clothes, but the child had already been killed. Their sorrowful expressions were pitiful. The cruelty of this crime is ten times worse than the kidnapping and extortion of bandits. The team has already recovered twenty-seven wool sweaters of the abducted children, but no one has come to identify and claim them. The victimized families are urged to come to the team in Fahua West Town to investigate and claim their clothing as soon as possible. The time is from 10 AM to 4 PM.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Outbreak Discovered in Western Shanghai Health Bureau Actively Conducting Vaccinations</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Recently, cases of genuine smallpox have been discovered in Yongyuan Lane on Jing'an Temple Road, Caojia Lane in Daxi, and the Caojia Residence inside Kainal Road, Gisi Fei Road, in the Fourth District of Shanghai. A portion of the residents have already succumbed to the disease. Therefore, the Fourth Health Office of the First District Government, recognizing the rapid spread of smallpox in the district, is actively carrying out prevention work. In addition to disinfecting the areas where smallpox has been discovered, they have also notified the neighborhood leaders to inform the residents in the district to get vaccinated and issue certificates. The police station will also send officers to conduct a comprehensive inspection soon, and those without smallpox vaccination certificates will be punished. Therefore, a large number of residents in the district have been actively getting vaccinated. The West Shanghai Health Office at 1360 Yuyuan Road has started providing free vaccinations all day long since yesterday (6th). The public is urged to get vaccinated at the office as soon as possible to prevent the disease. Strictly Prevent Meningitis Outbreak Authorities Hope the Public Will Take Care of Their Health</p>
<p>The outbreak of meningitis has already attracted the attention of the health authorities. In addition to the Deputy Director issuing a statement urging residents to take care of their health, various prevention measures have been implemented in public health, such as carefully treating and strictly isolating patients with the disease in public hospitals. Public places have been ordered to circulate the air and regulate the temperature to prevent residents from catching colds without noticing. At the same time, the public is encouraged to get preventive vaccinations and apply for vaccinations, but the Health Bureau is also paying close attention to the quality of vaccines in various hospitals to ensure that they remain clean.</p>
<h3>Scholarship Donations Report</h3>
<p>The following is a list of donations received yesterday for the Shen Bao readers' scholarship fund: Mr. Xu: 3,000 yuan; Huaide Hall: 1,103 yuan; Pan Shengcang; Shanghai Bank Current Account Department; Members of the Cake, Steamed Bun, and Deep-Fried Dough Sticks Guild Li Wenbiao Gu: 1,000 yuan; Colleagues in the fresh fruit industry at the Hongkou Market: 800 yuan; Chen Gutang: 650 yuan; Lin Xiaolong: 300 yuan; Wang Yongcheng; Yang Congqian (compensation for damaged new shoes from the shoe store moved to assist): 200 yuan each; Lin Yao's previous surplus: 1,071,242 yuan; current surplus: 3,433,542 yuan.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Sets Duty-Free Baggage Allowance</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs began yesterday, by order of the Inspector General of Customs, to stipulate the following duty-free baggage allowances for travelers: For taxable items carried in travelers' baggage, if the import duty is less than 100 yuan in government bonds, the export duty is less than 80 yuan, or the transit duty is less than 50 yuan in government bonds, they will be allowed to pass duty-free.</p>
<h3>The Largest Orphanage Shanghai Orphanage</h3>
<p>Difficulties and Expectations</p>
<p>Precisely because it is so large, although it is managed quite well, and general expenses are kept to a minimum, the financial aspect still presents great difficulties. First, in terms of food, according to Director Lu, the orphanage can receive approximately twelve dan eight dou seven sheng of rationed rice per month, totaling 7,722 yuan (based on the old price of 6 yuan per sheng), and 1,809 jin of rationed flour, totaling 12,663 yuan (based on the old price of 7 yuan per jin). This is only enough for sixteen days. There is also a special allocation of ten sacks of rice per month, each sack totaling 6,240.5 yuan based on the old price of 891.8 yuan. This is enough for about seven days. The rest must be purchased from the black market, at least nine dan per month (enough for seven days), requiring another 14,400 yuan at the old price of 166 yuan per dan. Based on today's market prices, monthly food expenses alone total over 47,000 yuan. In addition, fuel, for economy, is mainly rice husks, totaling 120 loads per month, requiring approximately 4,800 yuan. Coal briquettes cost at least ten dan per month, totaling no less than 5,000 or 6,000 yuan. Meals for the teaching staff include seven tables for lunch and dinner, costing only 16 yuan per table, and three and a half tables of congee and vegetables, costing 3 yuan per table, totaling 320 yuan per day. For the 254 orphans, it costs 7.5 fen per person, totaling over 190 yuan per day; two staff members and three cooks cost 1.5 yuan per person, totaling 15 yuan. The total monthly food expense is approximately 10,000 yuan. Other daily necessities, books, stationery, salaries, miscellaneous items, repairs, water, and electricity total approximately 20,000 yuan. Therefore, current monthly expenses are over 70,000 yuan, and the cost of clothing and bedding for the orphans has not yet been included! (Editor's note: In recent months, the cost of living has doubled, and expenses far exceed this amount).</p>
<p>What is praiseworthy about the Shanghai Orphanage is that it does not have a large, fixed income. This New Year, it requested assistance from the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association. Committee member Rong Boyun went to investigate and suggested that efforts should be made to save costs, advising the reduction of cooks and assigning older children to rotate to save approximately 1,000 yuan per month. At the same time, he believed that the orphanage was well managed and faced financial difficulties and should be subsidized. The association decided to provide assistance, but the orphanage still faced difficulties due to rising prices and increasing expenses. It is said that ordinary donations are only slightly over 2,000 yuan per month from adoption donations and 6,000 to 7,000 yuan from orchestra performance donations. The remaining shortfall is covered by donations from enthusiastic members of society and fundraising by the director. Therefore, the orphanage is often in financial straits. Director Lu repeatedly expressed his hope that people from all walks of life would visit and provide guidance for improvement.</p>
<p>As we left the Shanghai Orphanage with a heart full of blessings for the 250 orphans, we caught sight of the "creed" of the orphanage, which seemed worth introducing here: Look at the suffering of the orphans and think about your own life. Those who care for the orphans in this orphanage are the saviors of the orphans. The effect of generosity is to reserve true talent for the country. Sincere relief of the orphanage is better than burning incense and eating vegetarian food. Mutual assistance and love can bring about a world of great harmony. The completion of charitable undertakings is based on all of humanity. (End)</p>

<h3>Military Propaganda Mission to Burma of Great Significance Press Counselor Matsudaira Delivers Remarks</h3>
<p>Press Counselor Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy spoke to our country's reporters on the 6th regarding the National Government's dispatch of a military propaganda mission to the India-Burma front. He expressed great respect for the mission, stating:</p>
<p>Safely Arrived at the Front</p>
<p>This National Government military propaganda mission to the India-Burma front, with the close cooperation of the Japanese army, the Burmese government, and the Free India Provisional Government, is actively promoting various policies. According to the National Government's Propaganda Department, the mission arrived safely at its destination in mid-February. This move has attracted significant attention from all sides. The Indian independence movement has long been a concern of the Chinese people, who have expressed sympathy. After last fall's Greater East Asia War, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Free India Provisional Government, visited China. The National Government authorities have a deeper understanding of and sympathy for India's independence movement and decided to send a military propaganda mission to Burma.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Policy</p>
<p>Now, they are still sending troops to India to maintain the British's intended status quo in India and cooperating with the British to make Burma a colony again. This move has caused great disappointment among those pursuing Indian independence. However, the National Government is sending a military propaganda mission to Burma, cooperating with the Indian national independence movement, and maintaining Burma's independence. This move has greatly inspired the officials and people of Burma and those pursuing Indian independence.</p>
<p>Deeply Anticipate</p>
<p>Before the mission departed, I was invited to give a speech to the members during their training in Nanjing and had the opportunity to talk with them. The members are all intellectuals with experience and courage and have vowed to dedicate themselves with the spirit of "sharing life and death" on the front lines of the Greater East Asia War. The spirit of these members moved me deeply. Now that I know that the mission has safely arrived at the India-Burma front to cooperate in the Greater East Asia liberation war, I would like to express my deep respect to the members of the mission here and look forward to the progress of their work.</p>
<h3>Obituary</h3>
<p>Our late father, Zeng Gongye (surnamed Zeng, given name Jun, courtesy name Zhigong), passed away at noon on February 8th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, at the age of seventy-six. He was born at the hour of Hai on March 30th of the Tongzhi 8th year of the Qing Dynasty. The unfilial children and grandchildren have personally witnessed his passing, observed the rituals of mourning, and will be holding a memorial service at the Zhuangyan Temple at the intersection of Pubei Road and Beile Road on March 13th of the Western calendar. We hereby announce this news.</p>
<p>Please obtain the biography of the late father from the Tongde Hospital on Tongfu Road or the Shen Bao office on Third Horse Road.</p>
<h3>Biography of Mr. Zeng Gongye, Established Name Mingqun</h3>
<p>Mr. Zeng Gongye served as the Director of the Auditing Department of this newspaper, with over twenty years of service, dedicated to his duties. He was sociable and harmonious with his colleagues. Unfortunately, he passed away on February 8th of this year at the age of seventy-six. All of us mourn his loss. Now, his son has written a biography, which we have excerpted to express our condolences. Editor's note:</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng (surnamed Zeng, given name Jun, courtesy name Zigong, also known as Gongye), his late grandfather had two sons, Shengxian and Bo, etc. Mr. Zeng was the younger son, born intelligent and blessed by nature. In the Gengzi year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, he traveled to the Yixiang Academy. Since the Jiawu year, Mr. Zeng felt that insufficient real learning could not be relied upon. He resolutely abandoned his studies to learn from Westerners, diligently studying mathematics, working tirelessly day and night. In a few years, he mastered the mysteries of arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and calculus. He also used diagrams to explain the principles of abacus and turned them into a book. In the Xinchou year, Wu Gong Huaijiu established the Wuben Women's School in Shanghai South. He consulted with Mr. Zeng. At that time, the social atmosphere was not open, and there were many obstacles. Mr. Zeng overcame public opinion, and the school was finally established, opening up a new era of women's education in our country. The Sericulture Girls' School, China Public School, Longmen Normal School, and other schools also competed to hire Mr. Zeng as a professor. In his spare time, he also worked as an editor for the China Bookstore Company, using it as a means of education. After the establishment of the Republic of China, he served as the Principal of the Jiangsu Provincial Second Women's Normal School, then served as the Principal of the Shanghai County Wuben Women's Middle School, while concurrently holding a teaching position at the Provincial Second Normal School, and the Wuben Women's School was the longest. Mr. Zeng believed that women's education was the mother of national education, and he devoted himself to women's education, which was why he cultivated the foundation of the country. He was willing to work hard and was always happy even when he was in adverse circumstances. Mr. Zeng was skilled in calligraphy, following the style of Yushi Men, especially proficient in Zhongding inscriptions, and skilled in seal carving. He liked to paint bamboo, loving its elegance. During his spare time, he wielded his brush freely, fulfilling the requests of those who sought his work. When there was a need to raise money for disaster relief or education, he never refused, even in the cold of winter or the heat of summer. In his later years, Mr. Shi Gong Zicai hired him to serve as the Director of the Auditing Department of Shen Bao, where he was loyal and dedicated, working through wind and rain without interruption for more than twenty years. On the afternoon of February of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, he retired from his post. As he was leaving the office, he chatted happily with his colleagues as usual. When he arrived home, he still greeted his neighbors. When he entered the room, he was eating snacks and talking about peanuts, when suddenly, an unprecedented pain struck his heart. He cried out in pain three times, and his breathing gradually shortened. When the coffee was brought to him, he could no longer drink it himself. Soon after, his eyes closed, and he passed away. Mr. Zeng was physically strong and full of spirit, and he always lived a healthy life, rarely experiencing illness. He was also a devout Buddhist, getting up early every morning and attending classes with respect and sincerity. Could this be why he was invited to be with Buddha and be reborn in the Pure Land!</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>What Should Not Exist in a Year of Increased Production</h3>
<p>Since this year is designated as a "Year of Increased Production," and this designation comes from the highest government authority, then "what is spoken" should be "acted upon" so that it does not contradict the spirit of wartime governance and does not betray the expectations of the people during wartime. If pronouncements cannot be followed by action, and if the manifestations of various facts are in constant contradiction with the government's decrees, the consequences would be truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>In order to increase production, the government must eliminate anything that obstructs the path to increased production. The greatest obstacle to increased production is the rampant spread of production funds without being concentrated. "Therefore, before the Lunar New Year, the financial authorities first instructed the banking community in the city to be cautious in lending." The intention was to prevent hoarding and speculation after the Lunar New Year. However, since the Lunar New Year, not only has hoarding and speculation not been prevented, but even some unscrupulous members of the banking community have themselves participated in hoarding, euphemistically calling it tightened lending. In reality, there is still a so-called black market for loans, resulting in a situation of extreme scarcity of goods and soaring prices. This has even led everyone to abandon the fundamentals and chase after the non-essentials, selling off the industrial securities representing general companies and firms to fund hoarding, ultimately leading to the peculiar phenomenon of a slump in wartime industrial securities, a phenomenon unique to China and not found in other countries during wartime. This phenomenon should not exist in a year of increased production because the prosperity of the Chinese stock market is an important condition for the development of national industry, and probably no one can deny this.</p>
<p>Since we are against stock speculation, we naturally cannot sympathize with the frenzy of the stock market – the frenzied rise or frenzied fall – because both the rise and the fall are artificial and stem from the abuse of speculative behavior, which has a profound and far-reaching impact on the entire wartime finance. In view of yesterday's reports that the authorities will thoroughly investigate those involved in stock speculation and short selling, we are specifically expressing this opinion.</p>
<h3>Public Basketball Tournament: Zhongbei vs. Tung Wah, Ren Yu vs. Hezhong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Basketball League continues tonight with the second act. The matches will still be held at the original venue starting at 6:00 PM. There will be two 甲組 (First Division) matches. Zhongbei will face Tung Wah for the first time. Zhongbei boasts national team players like Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, and Chen Xuesong and, together with China United, is regarded as one of the two giants in the basketball scene. Tung Wah is organized by famous football players like Mai Youliang, and they may pose a considerable threat to Zhongbei. The other match will be between Ren Yu and Hezhong. The schedule for today is as follows: China Film B vs. French Business (乙四 Second Division Group 4) at 6:00 PM, Sanlian vs. Chengfu (乙一 Second Division Group 1) at 6:45 PM, Zhongbei vs. Tung Wah (甲一 First Division Group 1) at 7:30 PM, Ren Yu vs. Hezhong (甲 First Division) at 8:30 PM.</p>

<p>The Tianguang Basketball Team welcomes 乙組 (Second Division) teams from family businesses and shops to compete. The contact address is Chen Cheng, No. 50 Gubba Road, telephone 77187.</p>
<h3>Economic Department of the First District Actively Investigates Hoarding, Hopes for Citizen Cooperation in Reporting</h3>
<p>The Economic Department of the First District Public Office of this city strictly manages the prices of various industries and sends personnel to conduct thorough investigations into hoarding and exceeding the price limits. It also investigates the inventory of various industries and firms, assigning the various sections to carry out the work. Because the original 130 investigators were insufficient to assign, additional personnel were added and trained before participating in the investigation work. On the one hand, they hope that citizens will cooperate and report all kinds of unscrupulous merchants such as hoarders in writing to the department (1st Floor, No. 29 Jiangxi Road), which will be accepted. Investigations will be conducted according to the address, and once verified, severe punishment will be imposed. Recently, several illegal commercial firms have been verified with the case and are being punished separately. The department will formally announce it within days to serve as a warning and to ensure the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Concrete Measures to Suppress Prices</p>
<p>According to the relevant authorities, concrete measures to suppress prices have been drafted. The main points are as follows: In order to effectively implement price limits, closer contact will be established with the police authorities. Those who privately raise prices or hoard goods for speculation, if there is conclusive evidence, will be prosecuted in accordance with the regulations for punishing hoarding and the special wartime criminal law. Even those who are slightly suspected will be strictly investigated by the relevant authorities. The price management mechanism will be strengthened as much as possible, and unified steps will be taken with the relevant agencies. The main and secondary commodities are being urgently priced so that everything has its official price. The trade associations are responsible for supervising their members. If a member's illegal behavior is verified, the association must also bear corresponding responsibility. The authorities added that they would encounter a fatal blow.</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Collecting Cotton Must Register with the Cotton Control Commission</h3>
<p>The authorities are currently actively purchasing cotton from the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. In order to prevent fraud in the collection and washing of cotton, the Cotton Control Committee has specifically stipulated that cotton merchants who wish to participate in cotton collection in the three provinces and two cities should submit a list prepared by the trade association to the Cotton Industry Federation for forwarding to the Cotton Control Committee for registration. Those who have not been registered and permitted are not allowed to purchase cotton. If a cotton merchant purchases cotton privately, they will be severely punished once discovered. When registered cotton merchants collect cotton, the quality inspection should be carried out in accordance with the inspection and acceptance regulations of the Cotton Control Committee. At the same time, cotton merchants should report the quantity of cotton purchased to the trade association on a ten-day basis, which should be reported to the federation for verification and forwarding to the Cotton Control Committee.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Storm (3)</p>
<p>Speaking of the dinner party, even a letter came from the family of a woman who had just given birth, urging him to come and have a chat. But Shinjiro was never really keen on going. He hadn't forgotten the discomfort he felt when he was invited to lunch on the day of the Emperor Jimmu Festival in his second year of junior high school. And the existence of that young girl, Shizuko, made him particularly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Shizuko, whom he had never thought of once while at Etajima, floated back into Shinjiro's mind as he saw the deep blue summer sky of Kagoshima again.</p>
<p>(She certainly is a strange girl.)</p>
<p>When he visited Takao for the first time since returning home, it so happened that she and her brother, Takao, were both in the study. At that time, she stood up in a huff and went to the cloakroom. Her expression at that time, that nonchalant attitude, was like a theatrical mask made of perpetual ice, an indescribable affectation that set her apart from others. Even her brother, Takao, was left speechless.</p>
<p>She had once scolded him with harsh sarcasm, calling him a "coward!" or saying that "he was the only one who had made something of himself!" This time, however, she was silent, as calm as a Nara Buddha statue. It was really impossible to tell what she was thinking!</p>
<p>For some reason, Shinjiro felt uncomfortable around Shizuko. So when Shinjiro attended the alumni dinner, he didn't invite Takao.</p>
<p>In the evening, as he rode the bus to Taden, the scenery was still beautiful. From there to the Tatsubei Villa, they called it the coastal area. Along that road, there were small restaurants with excellent views. It had long been the custom to bring one's own beef and cook it in a pot at these small restaurants. When he arrived at the second floor of the small restaurant, almost all of the alumni were there, including Banda, Taniguchi, and Hitoshi.</p>
<p>"Oh..."</p>
<p>"Yo..."</p>
<p>The friends were all as usual, except for Shinjiro, Kumazawa, and Komori, who were not only wearing dress uniforms but also behaving differently from the others. Shinjiro was smiling with pursed lips and puffed cheeks.</p>
<p>After finishing the skewers of mochi, the old woman brought out the white furnace. After finishing the large pot of mochi, they still had to finish the mountain of beef. Although they weren't drinking alcohol, they were all talking like they were drunk, discussing their alma mater, the naval academy, and the army.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow is the day for the naval volunteer physical exams. Those taking the exam should eat more beef to build up their strength!" Someone said, and everyone burst out laughing. Takao, however, was very serious as he reached into the pot with his chopsticks.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>That day, Shinjiro didn't have time to visit Takao during the day because he was delivering rice. He thought about going to encourage him during the physical exam, but there was no way to do so.</p>
<p>However, he was worried about the results. Fortunately, Takao safely passed the first day of the exam, which was considered problematic. In fact, the accounting school was different from the military academy, and mild nearsightedness was acceptable for admission. If he could pass this hurdle, then the second day's exam, which involved internal organs and other tests, could be predicted to be no problem. And last night, Takao's joy was as if he had ascended to heaven and was already enrolled in the accounting school. In fact, Takao's academic performance was better than Shinjiro's, so there was reason for him to be confident in the academic exam.</p>
<p>Because of this, although Shinjiro was thinking about it in his heart, he had no intention of going to the lecture hall of his alma mater, which was the examination venue.</p>
<p>"Please come to my house when you come back." Takao had said so himself!</p>
<p>It was a hot day. Although there was a light breeze blowing from the sea, the heat of Kagoshima was particularly intense.</p>
<p>Shinjiro was wearing only a singlet at the well, wiping his sweat, when Noriko called him.</p>
<p>"Shinjiro, a friend is looking for you!"</p>
<p>Wearing the summer uniform of their junior high school, Higashiyama and seven or eight other military group friends were standing in a row in front of the store entrance, looking a hundred times more courageous.</p>
<p>"Oh, congratulations!"</p>
<p>Shinjiro's face was beaming with joy from the bottom of his heart. "Gu-kun! There is an academic exam in December. You are confident in your physical exam and everything."</p>
<p>These little heroes laughed loudly, and Shinjiro suddenly realized that Takao was not among them.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with Murota?"</p>
<p>Hearing Shinjiro's question, they immediately stopped laughing.</p>
<p>"It's a real shame for him. I heard it's his respiratory system. Not good!"</p>
<p>Shinjiro's heart sank as if cold water had been poured over him. And although he felt sorry for his friends, he didn't invite them into the house. He just sent them away, quickly jumped on his bicycle,</p>
<p>And went to Takao's house without going in the main gate as before. He shouted loudly,</p>
<p>"Takao!"</p>
<p>As usual, there should have been an answer, but there was no response. When he shouted again, Shizuko's face appeared in the window of the study.</p>
<p>"My brother won't see anyone!"</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>Several Opinions on Improving the Distribution Mechanism</h3>
<p>— Zhenqiang</p>
<p>The implementation of the rationing system in our country was originally prompted by the soaring prices after the war. However, although the time that has passed is short, many problems have already arisen. The suffering that the people have suffered due to rationing is by no means what was originally expected. The author believes that in order to improve people's livelihoods and stabilize prices, it is necessary to start with universal rationing. However, if the rationing mechanism is not sound, then there will be no rationality in rationing. Therefore, I would like to put forward several opinions on thoroughly improving the rationing mechanism:</p>
<p>First, adjust the rationing mechanism and strengthen the power of rationing. As the saying goes: If a workman wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. In the past, the rationing organs were too duplicated in quantity. Take the area of Shanghai alone. There are no less than four or five organs responsible for rice and grain rationing alone, passing the buck to each other, and ultimately causing a mess, with the general public directly suffering. Therefore, the author believes that in order to adjust the rationing mechanism, we must first unify the rationing organization, absolutely avoid duplication, and then the power can be concentrated, the operation can be flexible, and the work can be dedicated, and rationing can be expected to improve. However, the personnel issues in the rationing mechanism must not be ignored. China has always had only rule by men and not rule by law, so that all laws are equivalent to mere formalities. Therefore, in order to seek the perfection of the rationing machine, the staff in the mechanism must have a spirit of abiding by and respecting the law. In order to make the staff abide by and respect the law, the minimum condition must be to ensure that the staff's lives are protected, and then punish the lawbreakers severely, so that they dare not be illegal. Only then is there a possibility of rationing being reasonable.</p>
<p>Second, the expenses of the rationing mechanism must be allocated from the national government's expenditure budget. The current trade control associations, cotton control associations, rice control associations, and other control and rationing mechanisms are all similar to people's self-government mechanisms. Although the initial expenses were borrowed from the Central Reserve Bank by order of the national government, there are no clear regulations on how much each control and allocation mechanism actually needs for expenses and how much is needed for procurement capital. The control association itself has neither production nor a fixed source of funding, and the necessary daily expenses are unavoidable. It is inevitable that a little profit will be added in the process of procurement and distribution, which will leave an opportunity for employees to engage in illicit practices, making it impossible for the upper levels to control the lower levels. If this is the case, even if there is a sound rationing mechanism, it will be all in vain. Therefore, the author believes that the expenses of the rationing mechanism must be paid by the national government. Because the control and rationing mechanism is the cornerstone of the government's policy of stabilizing people's livelihoods, the national government should pay the regular expenses so that the rationing and control mechanism does not fall into a state.</p>
<p>Third, the control and allocation mechanism must periodically announce the quantity purchased and the quantity allocated. While implementing the above two points is essential for addressing the root cause, it is also essential for addressing the symptoms. Because the accumulated abuses in various agencies in China are already deep, and in a huge organization, there will inevitably be one or two corrupt elements. If we do not think about fundamentally preventing fraud in advance, then punishing them afterward will be too late.</p>
<p>Fourth, the government appoints commissioners to supervise. Although the working conditions of the control and rationing mechanism are announced to the public periodically, if there is no responsible supervisor, then in the event of false reports by the staff in the control and rationing mechanism, the public has no right to inspect the entry and exit books. How can they know whether the public announcement is accurate? Therefore, there must be fair supervisors to supervise from the sidelines so that the so-called public announcement does not become a deceptive document. As for the supervisors, the government may temporarily use the current supervisory members of the Supervisory Yuan. On the one hand, it can save the national government's expenses and avoid creating new titles.</p>
<p>Fifth, the ration amount must be based on the actual minimum consumption amount per person. In the past, the ration amount implemented by each rationing mechanism could not meet the actual consumption amount of the people, especially daily necessities such as rice and grain, and the amount of shortage was too large, forcing the people to buy from the black market. Therefore, the amount of rations should be determined according to the minimum consumption of the people in order to completely eliminate the black market and achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihoods and suppressing prices.</p>

<h3>Responding to the Punctuality Movement</h3>
<p>The Chinese people were originally a nation that kept time. The so-called "cherish every inch of time, love every inch of light" is "a beautiful story in history books." Since the material civilization of the West was introduced into our country and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, the concept of time has disappeared invisibly, which is very regrettable. In order to actively promote time saving, Jie Yue specially awakened the people and completed the wartime system, initiated the punctuality movement, and noted that modern social interactions are frequent. In terms of gatherings and banquets, time should be strictly observed so that useful time is used for the total decisive battle, and not wasted. (Jing Yuan)</p>
<h3>A Poor State of Affairs After the Death of a Civilian School Employee</h3>
<p>Mr. Tong Dingming, whose courtesy name was Xinpan, was an employee of the Minli Women's Middle and Primary School. He had served in education for more than 20 years. Since 1940, he had been the accountant of the school. Unfortunately, he became ill from overwork and died in February of this year. He lived a life of hardship and hard work. After his death, there was nothing to bury him with. The school temporarily paid for the coffin and other expenses, totaling more than 20,000 yuan, but there was no way to replenish it. Mr. Tong's surviving family includes his wife and five children. The family's livelihood and the children's education expenses are all without a source. Mr. Tong died for education. How can we stand by and watch his descendants starve and fill the ditches? Therefore, the teachers and students of the school have jointly organized a donation committee to comfort Mr. Tong's surviving family. In addition to the teachers and students of the school making their own donations, we respectfully appeal to people from all walks of life and kind people to show mutual aid and generously donate to collect money so that his descendants can barely survive. The committee of all teachers and students of Minli Women's Middle and Primary School is raising funds for the education and welfare of the descendants of Mr. Tong Xinpan.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Xihu Museum in Xizhou</p>
<p>The Hangzhou Xihu Museum is one of the leading museums in our country. Although it has inevitably suffered some losses since the Incident, it has generally restored its former appearance. Since the Ministry of Education of Zhejiang Province appointed Lu Zhonghuai as the curator of the museum last autumn, he has spared no effort in reorganizing and managing it. The internal displays have not only mostly restored their former appearance, but also the displays of new objects in the natural and humanistic museums have increased daily. Among them, there are two male and female mummies (commonly known as zombies), which are particularly outstanding, and the insect specimens in the natural science museum are especially rich.</p>
<p>Scholarship: The Shangqing Middle and Primary School has a Chongxian Hall, which donates funds to help 50 students of the Shangqing Middle and Primary School with half of their tuition fees in order to take care of poor children who are unable to study. Those who are truly poor and have aspirations for education can apply to the school at No. 66 Qingdao Road.</p>
<p>Lectures: The Chinese Confucius Society, No. 954 Dashanghai Road, today (Tuesday) from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, has invited Mr. Wu Jiming to lecture on "Mencius" and Mr. Yang Zhongyi to lecture on "The Great Learning." All are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Li Wenbiao of the Municipal Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Twist Trade Association donated 1,000 yuan to the Old Age Home, and Peng Geng donated 100 yuan to the Young and Young Care Home. We have forwarded it on behalf of them. Liu Kaike donated 150 yuan to the Buddhist porridge factory. We hereby express our gratitude.</p>
