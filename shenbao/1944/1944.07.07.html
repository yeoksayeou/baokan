<p>社評</p>
<h3>又一個嚴重敎訓</h3>
<p>本市米糧入口，七月一日實施徵購以務，據昨日報載米統會的調查報吿，自七月一日至三日的三天，徵購所得的數量僅三十石，第一第二兩日各徵購十一石，第三日减至六石。而搬入數量則第三日較第一第二兩日反多。黑巿米價則逐日步漲，我們根據該會報吿數字，列如左表，試加比較，以見一斑：</p>
<p>日期　搬入數量　徵購數量　米價　　一日　四一五四石　一二石　一〇六〇〇元</p>
<p>二日　四五三〇石　一二石　一一二〇〇元</p>
<p>三日　五二六三石　六石　一一二〇〇元</p>
<p>四日　五六八三石　未詳　一二三〇〇元</p>
<p>從上表數字以觀，値得注意者：　搬入數量逐日遞增，而徵購數量則遞减，適成反比例。　徵購數量佔搬入數量的百分率，僅及千分之一二。與規定百分之三十比較，誠是小得可憐。　米價則逐日上漲（六月三十日米價為九七〇〇元，據實際黑巿價格，尙不止此數·）　徵購價格，縱以最高價之三千二百元計算，與黑市價相差四倍，與產地米價相差二倍（靑浦松江六五〇〇元）。</p>
<p>第一，為什麽搬入數量逐日遞增，而微購數量反見减少呢？因為微購價格過低，不及成本，更論論合理利潤。於是盡量避免微購，化整為零。</p>
<p>第二，為什麼米價逐日上昇呢？因為微購價格過低，不及成本，於是失之於徵購部分的虧蝕者，取愼於自由賣買部分，以為挹注。</p>
<p>所以，我們可以說，目前的徵購辦法與徵購價格，依然是不合理的，徒然刺激為價上漲，益使米糧問題增加嚴重性，這些事實的歸趨，身負米糧統制責任者應該深切反省而不能熱視無睹的。</p>
<p>七日五日新聞報經濟社論，認為根據京滬兩市　食米臨時措置綱要，及上海市民食米管理　行辦法中，食米徵購的主要意義，原是修正過去低價收買的不合理性，應以成本加相當利潤。從而增加收購的數量，充實配給，抑低黑市。我們也認為這點確是政府立法的用意所在。然而，現在所實施的徵購價格，為什麽不顧成本不顧合理利潤，因而形面徵購數量减少，米價黑巿激漲，洽絲益禁的現象。對於米統會這樣的措置，我們不能不認為百思莫解。</p>
<p>况且，原為充實配給而希望增加收購，如今適得其反，在三天之內，僅僅收購三十石。試問這三十石米可以「充實配給」嗎？如果以上海市民五百萬計算，每斗米有三十萬粒，（有人試數過每合米約為三千粒。更如齊民要術中則謂禾每斗五萬一千餘粒，大約為未去彀的穀。）則三十石米共有九千萬粒，三天之中，每人可得配給米十八粒，試問這樣的徵購，還是對於民食有幫助呢？還是對於公糧有幫助呢？雖三尺孩提，亦知其絕不中用了一。然而，為了徵購這三十石米，因之三之內刺繳米價上漲了每石一千五百元（卽就報載調查報吿數字，實際上尙不止此）以每人每月食米一斗半，三天食米一升半計算，就增加負擔二十二元五角。換句話說，就是巿民已經先付出二十二元五角的代價，而取得尙未配給到手的十八料米。這樣措置結果，究竟是利民還是害民呢？</p>
<p>我們並不欲斷章取義，苛刻批評，實在感覺民食問題的嚴重性，絕對經不起刺激了。更且，這次米統會決定實施徵購辦法，是何等重大的措置，曾否經過政府的核准？曾應經過全體委員會議商討？要是僅憑少數人主觀，貿然決定，更不免有輕率從事之嫌。</p>
<p>我們會在七月四日社評中主張，商統會經最近調整後，米統會是其所屬的五個委員會之一，有指導監督的權責。所以，米統會的措施，商統會應連帶負責，按照目前時令與實際情形，徵購已不合時宜。現在的米統會應從速改組，辦理結束工作。同時側重全力準備秋收時的米糧統制工作。如何根據過去失敗的經騐，如何斟酌現實的環境，訂定合情合理的方案，以免屆時臨渴掘井，措施悉乖，　苦民生。特別重要者應由商統會愼重遴選適當的主持人員，必須對於米業方面有經騐，有信譽，有歷史關係而操守廉正者主持辦理。現在我們更主張商統會應即負起指導監督責任，對於目前不合時宜的徵購辦法，卽且廢止。問題嚴重，時機緊迫，已不容遲徊　顧，心減巿民水深火熱之苦</p>
<h3>襲硫黃等島未逞敵機動部隊遁走日軍擊落敵機七四架以上</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電日大本營六日下午五時三十分發表：來襲硫黃島及小笠原羣島之敵機動部隊，經當地日軍之邀擊，巳於七月四日下午遁走，是役共擊落敵機七十四架以上，日軍損失飛機三十架，船舶五艘。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍某基地電，商軍機動部隊及艦載機羣，三·四兩日曾攻擊硫黃島，四日一日攻擊父島，父島日軍所在部隊，將連續來襲之敵機數百架擊落二十架。又四日敵軍巡洋艦，驅逐艦等砲轟父島之消息，乃係誤報。敵軍於四日僅以艦砲轟擊硫黃島。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電中部太平洋日軍某基地電，敵機羣曾於四日襲大宮島，該地日軍部隊當與之邀擊，擊落其十九架，日方損害極輕。又敵機十五架五日襲雅普島，該地日軍部隊擊毀其五架，將之擊退，是役，日機一架失事，但駕駛員平安降陸。</p>
<h3>塞班島入决戰階段</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日大營五日發表，塞班島戰事目下已步入極重大階段，茲錄之如次：上月十五日最，敵在猛烈之砲繫轟炸掩護下，以水陸兩用戰車企圖上陸，兩次均被日軍在海岸殲滅。敵第三次上陸時，日軍整燬敵戰軍十餘輛後，因敵軍拉邦市街，塔堡喬山南麓及　　西北地方整頓陣地，二十三日起，敵軍集中砲火聶擊，進攻塔堡喬山，同時更以有力戰車部隊自東海岸逐步進逼，日軍雖奮戰力鬥，不得已於二十六日放棄塔堡喬山頂拔海四百七十四米之塞班島最高山峰。塔堡喬經敵軍集中砲擊轟炸後，旬日間山貌已為之大變，戰事之激烈，可以想見，敵軍奪取塔堡喬山峰後，立以戰事為先鋒，以有力部隊進攻東岸要地頓尼迨。二十八日戰事益趨慘烈，彼時日軍部隊乘機出以逆襲，或以挺身斥堠殺入敵陣，或以少數砲火攻繫敵軍開始運用之阿斯利特飛機塲，繼續血戰，如是戰綫逐次移轉至該島之東北端。現日軍雖被迫至距該島北岸六公里之阿秋果山麓地方，然陸海軍將士及殘留僑民仍拼死血戰，其間與敵損書極犬，敵軍司令部雖朱發表，然推測敵軍上陸以來至三十日，其損失已達一萬以上，敵軍上陸兵力約為二三師，已殲滅其半數，但日軍損害亦逐次增加，現正與優勢之敵軍展開白刃戰，日軍將士激烈之鬥爭，雖剩一兵一卒，亦將在殉國之偉大精神下繼續抵抗，戰綫目下已呈混亂狀態，戰事已至重時期。</p>
<h3>從化南方日軍　結成圍綫　激戰正繼續進行中</h3>
<p>日軍某地六日中央社電　沿粵漢路北上之日軍各部隊，現已排除鐵路東西兩側渝軍之抵抗，繼續前進。一方於粵漢路西方追擊敗殘逾軍之日軍部隊，突破渝軍堅强陣地，而將筆架山（淸遠東方一公哩半）觀音嶺（淸遠西北二公哩，）二地佔領後，刻正追擊企圖南北江北岸退却之渝軍。一面另一部隊為與之呼應起見，亦於四日傍晚佔領白石口（淸遠西方一公里。）又沿粵漢綫東方北進之日軍一部，三日業於從化南方山岳地帶，結成包圍綫，四日更將從化縣城置於包圍圈內，該方面作戰刻正激烈繼續中。</p>
<p>韶關英德居民撤退</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央　社電據美聯社電慶特派員訊，湖南廣東之戰局如次：中國戰局之進展，對日軍愈為有利。刻下衡陽已被日軍四面包圍，渝軍向西南方後退之路，悉被切斷，但仍死守該市。日重吏繞過衡陽南方六十公里之耒陽，進至該巿南郊，即衡陽南方，粵漢綫上約八十公里之點，至於由廣州地區北上之日軍，刻分兵三路向廣州西北七十公里之淸遠，東北四十公星之從化，及東北四十公里之龍門三處，分頭進之日軍，於寬約百餘公里，粵綫東西兩側一帶之廣大戰綫上，一齊開始進，於自湖南部南進之日軍先鋒部隊，與自廣東省北部北上之日軍先鋒部隊，相距僅約三百公里。而廣州至漢口長一千一百公里之粵漢綫泰半於日軍堂握未佔領之地區，僅有韶關及其南方之英德，渝軍刻正謀以該兩要衝阻止日軍北進。又衡陽地區之日軍，有向西南進攻之概，渝軍當局正迫令桂林韶關英德等重要都市之居民撤退，防備日軍進攻。河南·湖南·兩省京漢粵漢鐵路沿綫，開始有大規模之避難，民衆移動又呈現出中日事變發生之當時沿海各省，居民羣向內地移動之景象。桂林邇來已成為廣東·江西·湖南·各省難民必經之路，現在甚至桂林本地之人民，亦忙於避難因逃難巿民莫不棄家捨物，携帶現款而逃，百貨不得傾銷，物價於是暴降，聞渝軍刻正拆毀衡陽至桂林之一段湘桂鐵路。</p>
<p>湖南戰綫日軍猛攻</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據重慶電，渝府五日深夜發表湖南·廣東·方面戰報如次：湖南戰綫衡陽各地，依然繼續激戰。日軍三日晚在猛烈之大砲掩護下，於全綫繼續猛攻，渝軍亦以空軍及砲火作掩護防察，目下全綫已展開凄慘之激戰，湘江兩岸渝軍向進擊之日軍反攻，耒陽南方日軍進抵距城二十公里之淝江，渝軍與之邀擊。渝軍在其他全綫，已與日軍激戰，廣東戰綫日軍三日佔領龍江後，渝軍當夜反攻，已在淸遠東西郊外交戰。</p>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍及美軍刻對完全為日軍包閣之衡陽守備部隊，以B25型聶炸機作低空飛行，從空中開始投擲武器彈藥，企圖防止該市之陷落。</p>
<p>渝美空軍改取守勢</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地六日中央社電　駐華日空軍之主要作戰目標，乃在之企圖。今日軍之中國作戰，已着着收獲成果，故轉變，日粉軍於茲，即將轉為一大攻勢，緣日軍陸地部隊自湖南及江西方面進入渝美空軍基地界，首先圖取衡陽機塲，日機隊當即推進基地，遮斷遂川·建甌·贛州·吉安·等地之聯絡，於是即放棄過去之態度，完成一大規模之攻勢。據傳渝美空軍以形勢逆轉，乃改取守勢，企圖暫時退隱桂林，重整旗彭，再圖蠢動。然日軍陸地部隊，威力猶能威脅桂林，故渝美空軍司令捷諾特，已決放棄桂林，再向昆明遁避，此足證明捷諾特之對日空襲作戰計劃，已全面受挫，隨地作戰之進展，衡陽及桂林已不待言，日空軍更將進至渝空軍根據地昆明，殲滅美國侵略亞洲之第十四航空隊，燁碎其野望。刻日軍此種雄大之戰略企圖，正着着進行中。</p>
<h3>緬特別調查團　由平飛抵京　褚外長特設宴招待</h3>

<p>新京六日中央社電　今為七七紀念日，滿洲國李外交大臣特就目前現况及重慶拖戰之謬誤，發表談話如下：中日事變，在大東亞戰局熾烈進展中，適逢七週年紀念，中於日軍之勇猛奮戰，如今敵美英之根據地悉皆失守，新秩序之建設，共榮圈之確立，節節進展。大東亞諸國，皆肩起建設共榮圈之重任，邁向完遂戰爭之途，我國在日本協助下，國內一切建設，莫不突飛猛進。盟邦中華民國，在汪主席閣下領導下，國力日益發展，和平地區日益擴大。同時，更努力建設工作，改善國民生活，經濟日益繁榮，國府决戰下之經濟新體制，已固如磐石。軍事方面，亦日見充實，並據有多數精强之陸海軍，挺身於和平建國第一綫，一面更協力日軍，從事擊滅敵美英，樹立光輝事業，而抗戰地區人民，已多抱和平建國之覺悟，絡繹歸入和平地區。如今抗戰陣營逐見崩潰，且誇為抗戰根據地之洛陽·長沙，悉皆歸於日軍手中，此時，抗戰陣營如再不顧同文同種之誼，而仍繼續拖戰，實愚蠢之至。</p>
<h3>日科學技術團體　舉行聯合會　硏究新兵器增强生產</h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府為集中國民科學精萃，共同致力於作戰技術之研究，以增强戰力，特於去歲十一月成立技術院。又日本科學技術團禮聯合會，亦動員數十萬之科學者，從事新兵器之發明創造，故日本之決戰科學技術之昻揚運動，已於全國展開。又技術院，全國科學技術聯盟，科學學會，科學協會等機關團體，更於五日於此間丸之內飯店舉行日本科學技術團體聯合會，進行協議各種具體案件。按術院之創意課，自去年十一月一日成立以來，迄本年六月已收到國民之發明提案七三五六件，該等案件內，關係決戰兵器者，佔全數百分之六十，內中大部分多係關於飛機之新硏究，此一點亦可見國民關心航空兵器之情况。其餘百分之四十，係關於生產增强之新發明。又全件數中之最優秀者五三五件，已由技術院分別於三月及六月作兩次對發明者授予表彰，同時已開始試作，內中已有多數試作完成，對强化戰力貢獻頗大。惟戰局今益苛烈，科學界之緊急動員，更為當前之急務，故此資特以技術院為主體，召集全國百五十學會及協會，澈底動員全國所有之科學者，以期更進一步發揮全體國民之發明創造。並預定至十月末止，集合此等案件，分門別類，由技術院轉達軍當局及關係官廳，以及各生產工塲，並除於專門家從事專門硏究外，更期待凡普通者亦能有所硏究，以達動員全國所有科學者之實效，對新兵器及增强生產之必要技術上，有所貢獻。</p>
<h3>東歐南部德軍　正整備戰綫　芬全綫蘇開始新攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局五日對記者團談稱：東路南部之德軍對蘇軍之開始攻勢，早有準備。德軍於中部戰綫之作戰行動，亦因蘇軍之南部攻勢而始活動者，目下德軍於南部戰綫後方正移動兵力，整備戰綫，但主要戰綫刻尙無戰爭。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央央社電　前綫消息，據飛機偵察報吿傳蘇軍刻於拉脫維亞東南要衝特文斯克（Dvilisk）東南方，結集有力之機械化部隊，預料蘇軍司令部最近必將於特維納（Dwima河中流地區，發動大規模攻勢。</p>
<p>柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：卡萊里亞地峽內之蘇軍，向芬蘭灣及拉多加湖全綫開始新攻勢，先以大砲擊，復出動戰鬥機掩護，但所到之處，輒遭猛烈砲火之痛擊，多被迫後退，湯巴郎亞爾維附近之蘇軍，突破數缺口，但被德軍反攻所堵合，主要戰綫仍在芬軍掌握中。拉多加湖方面，蘇軍三大隊向西或西北推進，抵薩爾米維爾，亞爾維及傑索，拉多加湖迤北之馬蔭爾凱一段有激戰，進攻朱斯特亞爾維迤北西及蒙亞維之蘇軍，悉被擊退。魯卡亞爾維附近，衹有局部之接觸，德戰鬥機羣在維普利迤北擊毀敵極四十五架，毀敵坦克車十五輛</p>

<h3>排球聯賽週末展幕　談甲組女組</h3>
<p>本屆排球聯賽，參加者計甲組五隊，乙組二十二隊，女十組六隊。即將於本月九日展開序幕。預料此繼足籃球後之排球比賽，又將鬨動一時矣。茲乘此展幕之前，介紹甲組及女組之實力於后，作一宣傳，當爲提高興趣而已，想必爲球迷所樂讀歟。</p>
<p>巾幗英雄</p>
<p>三省—該隊之致力排球，遠逾籃球，察其實力，確屬不凡。麾下健將如雲，能征慣戰，剛健姿熊，不讓鬚眉。如史瑞娟之經騐老到，李波之哄雲托月，陳梅貞之突叩，陳榴貞之猛擊，馳譽球搜，久享盛名。且該隊練習甚殷，肯下苦功，前中後三排聯絡有路，木屆對於冠軍一席，頗具雄心。語云：「有志者事竟成」，願史隊長等勉力以赴，必能如願以償也。</p>
<p>志騫—溶合老將新手於一憈。張嘉箴。　少挑·祝士芳爲球壇宿將。張敏玉·徐蔚·祝瑞英·爲後起良材。現聞延譚永淇爲指導，在上海女中球塲，埋頭苦練，志在不小。日後向鼎中原，這一路娘子軍，委實未可輕視。</p>
<p>華嚴—爲張家花園華嚴里同里所組織，已有六年歷史。該隊初不以錦標爲主，得失爲懷，以運動而運動，故極爲一般人所刮目相視。唯年來以出戰較多，經騐自體，成續日新月異。如朱之佩彭國英輩，確可擠入第一流人材中，且有徐令嫻之從中指揮，英名日增。在此聯賽結東之日，當可爲該隊</p>
<p>綠隊—自得籃球及圓門球兩項錦標後，此次對於排球，果亦存染指之心。據記者探其陣容，如飾排黃杏芬·注印籣。中排黃明媛·王維珍·劉珍實，及三排項毓琳楊文鵑容淑儉等。均稱身手矯健，不愧全材。况新進竹承然·嚴蔚雯·張敏知·李韞芝輩，在良好指導之下，巳有優異成績。故該隊視之，似無三省·志騫之野心。至少威脅各隊，有良好戰績，而出奇制勝，亦在未定之天。再獲銀盾，未必無望！勉之！</p>
<p>其餘二隊，均爲西人隊，西靑及蘇維埃。中以西靑總實力雄厚，唯以其習於美國規則，中靑球房，恐難有多大發展。總之，本屆華隊四路娘子軍，均稱雄厚，將來必列前茅，尚望好事以為，各展所長，亦光榮之一頁也。</p>
<p>鬚眉健兒</p>
<p>華影——自得前遠東代表譚永湛薰陶，及北國各將李寳中來歸，籃球聖手李震中助陣，聲勢大盛，菲復吳下阿蒙。譚及二李，俱有絕活殺手鐧，爲該隊得分之銷鑰。惜乎憾事，按譚永湛君當年咄叱風雲，不可一世，其身手矯健，迄仍縈迴。今雖處事稍高，而寶刀未老，徐娘風姿，猶足與少艾爭長，殊不可喜，且肯循循敎導其他隊員，故華影或可有滿意之演出。</p>
<p>粵華——人材最為整齊，如郭炳坤，麥炳堯，鄭吉常，韓若愚，余鄒子，馬燦希，陳學崇輩，各有特長。其中尤以郭炳坤之猛敲，麥炳堯之攔網的反叩，余郇子之善用機智，要爲其他各隊難望其項背。該隊如無意外變化，則奪得冠軍，大有當今之世，舍我其誰哉！</p>
<p>白隊——雖有悠久之歷史，而未能有特殊之戰績。蓋該隊素抱聯絡感情爲主，向無拉攏隊員之舉。始終以汪德元昆仲程隊健將張顯崙瞿錫能陳祚良等之來歸，人材較爲齊整。當能有絞佳之球藝以　我人。</p>
<p>再有二隊，為蘇聯及俄僑，均係俄人組織，沈高力大。對於排球，亦具相當基礎。日後或能有冷門之出。凡我華隊，固未可予以輕視也。</p>
<h3>足球季結束　小球聯賽產生</h3>
<p>本市小足球聯合會，發起主辦首屆小型球聯賽，報名參加者共達一百八十入隊之多，開球賽罕有之紀錄。分甲，乙，丙，丁四組，因加入隊數過多，每組另分若干部，將來各都錦標產生後，再決總冠軍。該賽特成立競賽委員會主持其事，其名單如下：</p>
<p>談熹，（主席）張葆奎，沈回春，鄧效良，錢威烈，陳吉祥，黃仁彝。</p>

<p>精武—俄體甲（甲二）四時二十分李國義</p>
<p>印度—榮華（丁四）五時三十分金家標</p>
<p>三省—德商會（甲三）六時四十分陳吉祥</p>
<p>甲二組精武對俄體甲，雙方各擁足球名將，必多精彩鏡頭，精武甫於前月成立，曾公開招考隊員，加入者頗爲踴躍，麾下計有東羣韓龍海，李垚，陳明哲，韓龍根。三省之羅籌福，徐國福等。而陶自鳴，陶廷富，及沈錦達，趙永芳輩，均巳屬沙塲之老將，故陣容充實，戰鬥力深强。</p>
<p>至俄體甲爲俄籍健将組織，不啻一警之化身，如薩文，恩的比夫，　　尙，卓倫蒂夫等，俱係驍勇善戰之輩，實力不在精武之下，屆時雙雄初逢，一番龍虎門，珠難料勝利誰屬。</p>
<p>三省乃後起之秀，曾獲本屆滬聯足球丙組總冠軍，此番參加小型球甲組，以其合作之默契及球藝之熱，定有優異成績。諸小將個個似生龍活虎，而金碌生之矯健，更屬不可多得，全隊防守功夫，無懈可擊。</p>
<p>德商即德國隊，有北歐名手許而楚，福恩，及潘脫遜昆仲助戰，非比平庸之流。明日與三省相逢，當有一番劇烈之競爭，而戰情之如火如茶，更可預期。</p>
<p>附明日甲組四隊陣容：</p>

<h3>健身訓練簡易法（二）（十）</h3>

<h3>太平洋前綫的　基地爭奪戰</h3>
<p>西南太平洋</p>
<p>交戰國的一方，如不取得制控權，則任何作戰亦不可能，這種戰爭的特異性，在今日尤爲顯著，正如西南太平洋上的戰局，陸海兩稱戰爭似乎不起絲毫作用，而只是根據地由一個鳥嶼到一個烏嶼地向飾推進着進行空戰。至於廣闊海洋上星點的爲嶼爭奪，是如何困難，這一點試觀過去二年所罷門和新幾內亞的敵方反攻形勢，也足可以明瞭。縱然以那樣衆人力的消耗和無限龐大鐵量的投擲，其收復的速度，也不渦像蝸牛爬步那碟的慢。</p>
<p>世界第二大島的新幾內亞，其地勢，完全是人跡未到的險峻區，以及茫無邊際的森林和濕地，所以從陸地上的進攻是不可能的。換言之，敵我雙方的基地數目，只不過是三四十個散在的小島那樣特異作戰地區。</p>
<p>消耗與補充</p>
<p>西南太平洋上基地爭奪戰之主要方法，就是接近無限的消耗戰與補充戰。這種補充穩定的絕對必要性，以及充實木來驚人天攻勢的戰力，而日軍曾一時縮短戰綫，同時美國乘此機會的反攻，依賴用乏不盡取之不竭的大量生產，而極端加强了熾烈的程度。</p>
<p>敵方空軍的攻擊方法，是用羅特戰法（單縱陣形編隊攻擊法）突入的。如我方飛機對付一號機時，則二號機三號機就追隨而來，不有放鬆。空戰中一架對三架是比兩架對六架更爲有利的，日軍對美國如能保持這樣比例，則日方定能取得最後勝利。</p>
<p>在這話的另一面裏，就是說，質無論怎樣優劣，而如缺少量時，則應取得的勝算，也會不翼而飛。現在整個西南太平洋上的方法，只有迅速補充飛機和飛行員。最近敵方以中部太平洋爲當前的主要戰塲，而傾注大量兵力，以加强反攻。同時由西南太平洋而西進北上的戰略，也不肯鬆懈，目前在新幾內亞島的荷閘蒂亞，敵方大軍登陸，而與日軍激戰中。曉得這一點。就不要忘記西南太平洋仍是決定日本生死存亡的主要戰塲。（譯自五月三十一日每日新聞）</p>
<p>中太平洋</p>
<p>敵美企圖染指日本內南洋圈，已非一日，前此侵攻馬紹兩島，即爲其初步野心的暴露。此次悍然作長距離跳躍，發動塞班島登陸戰，野心更大。</p>
<p>先是五月二十七日，敵美西南太平洋司令長官麥克沃塞部隊，在必阿克登陸，激戰歷二十餘日未已。敵方侵攻必阿克島，想以之作爲侵攻非律濱的跳板，同時敵方野心勃勃又圖突破中太平洋日軍防綫，太平洋艦隊司令尼米資即傾其全力，在塞班島悍然登陸，麥克沃塞與尼米資兩人，一搭一擋，企圖在太平洋，展開二正面作戰，其野心昭然若揭。</p>
<p>塞班島攻防戰</p>
<p>担任塞班島登陸的機動部隊，在馬利亞納羣島東方海面出動，六月十一日以來，向塞班·特尼安·羅特·大宮島一帶日方堅强基地，反復加以轟炸，旋於十三日，出動戰艦·巡洋艦·驅逐艦等艦隊，接近塞班島，以艦砲向陸上轟擊，敵兵在砲火掩護下，分乘有力輸送船團，於十五日淸最，企圖登陸。</p>
<p>日方駐守部隊，勇敢善戰，前後在水濱兩度擊退退敵人，三度來慶之敵，附有一部　　軍，近數日來，陸上繼續展開激戰，日方守備部隊，加以猛烈反攻，其間敵方有力機動部隊依然在該島附近，爲使陸上戰有利度開起見，不分畫夜，向日方陣地猛烈砲轟，彈如南下。</p>
<p>另一方面，敵別動部隊於十五十六兩日，對於運結馬利亞納羣島與內地的中間基地如硫黃烏，父島等，加以猛烈轟炸，俾使塞班島方而戰事，獲得便利，為對付計，日方航空部隊亦於十一日夜，襲擊敵艦隊，首先擊沉敵艦一艘，共後又虞加攻擊，同時特尼安砲台，於十五日淸晨擊毀敵方戰艦一艘，在敵登陸部隊背面，予以重大威脅。</p>
<p>攻防戰的意義</p>
<p>按塞班烏的攻防戰，具有三項重大意義：</p>
<p>第一，塞班烏爲太平洋防衛綫的核心，自內地連結特魯克，帛硫等島，成爲日方强　的內南洋要塞綫的核心，即馬利亞納烏，一望而知。</p>
<p>第二，敵方覬　塞班島，企圖以此作為航空基地，俾利用長程轟炸機，反覆轟炸日本本土，塞班島距李離日本本士僅二千二百餘公里，敵方來製北九州的B29超重轟炸機，來去裕如，敵方之亟亟於取得塞班鳥，其故在此。</p>
<p>第三，敵方爲爭取戰略的地位，故出動尼米資艦隊的巨大機動部隊，作猪突戰。</p>
<p>關於敵方所出動的艦一隊，前此馬紹爾侵攻戰之際，即宣傳爲「空前的大編成」，則今次出動的大水上部隊，至少不劣於前次的機動部隊，自可想像。敵以大艦隊，直入日木本土與內南洋的巾間，不啻直迫日方海面，敵方唯，一的戰術爲推進基地制空權，而在）茲地制空權下，進行登陸作戰，航空母艦所載飛機，取得絕對優勢主義，而作大膽的豬空戰。惟　者必敗，敵方機動部戰終必遭整減而後已。</p>
<p>敵艦隊現狀</p>
<p>敵美太平洋艦隊司令尼米資產下艦隊在中太平洋反攻以來，頗受創傷，美國艦隊實力的間題，因此頗堪注意。擄最近美國體隊司令金上將或海軍委員長名遲的報告，誇稱開戰三年來美的海軍實力如何增大，大有自得之意。</p>
<p>據說美國現有航空母艦六十五艘，戰艦二十艘，巡洋艦五十至六十艘，驅逐艦三百艘，潛永艦一百六十五艘。最近外電所傳，西歐陸戰展開之際，美戰艦「阿剛索」「合克蕯斯」「奈巴達」三艘，與英戰艦協力轟擊，掩護登陸。查「合兄蕯斯」「阿剛索」爾艦，戰前爲美國大西洋艦隊中的老朽兵艦，由此可見，美海軍以主力集中太平洋，特別以新銳艦的大部配置太平洋上，以作反攻的重心。</p>
<p>開戰以來美戰艦的建造狀况如下：三萬五千噸「北加洛里那」號及「華盛頓」號的姊妹艦計一南達柯泰」號，「麻薩塞茲」號，「印地安那」號，「阿拉巴瑪」號四艘，及四萬五千噸的巨型戰艦「俄海華」「紐遮饗」共六艦，聞已下水編入艦隊。</p>
<p>航空母艦方面，預定建造七千噸至二萬五千噸的「愛賽克斯」及制空母艦十三艘，其中六艘已就役。一萬噸巡洋艦改造的小型航空母艦，有九艘已下水，由商船改造的護送用特設航空母繼約有五十艘。</p>
<p>美太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資屬下為中部太平洋作戰司令史邦斯，東南太平洋艦隊司令長官夏洛夫，北太平洋水域海軍司令弗萊轍，海爾賽廳下的南太平洋艦隊已終三月底解散之海爾賽艦隊的作戰區域，編入麥克沃塞的作戰區域，使尼米資與麥克沃寒兩人艦隊實力平分。海爾黃則轉任尼米資與下第三艦隊長官。太平洋艦隊人事調整之後，即以一部份機動部隊，向新幾內亞西進作戰，並出動强大機動部隊，突人內南洋圈，企圖恃數量之衆，而取得優勢，結果遭受重大挫折。（譯自六月十九日及二十一日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>加恩前綫德兵壕中漫談</h3>
<p>北法諾曼第飾綫的重鎮加恩，現正激戰巾，德軍壯烈抵抗誓興陣地共存亡。德哦從軍記者休馬爾福斯，頃自前綫寄來通訊一篇。題爲「加恩附近塹壕中的對話」，描墓前綫德軍的旺盛士氣，躍然紙上，以下便是：</p>
<p>我們沿着一條田舍道，挖掘深穴，潛人其中。這絛田舍道並不與街道或村道相通，但沿着走，可以至加恩市。我的身傍有兩個戰車擲彈兵，埋身地穴裏，架着一挺機關槍，割取野草，堆在地穴四周，恰巧齊胸。半小時以前，我們四個人還是好好在一起，突然間一陣慘烈的砲彈，向這裏飛來，其中一彈在我們身傍炸裂，一個同伴喊聲「他媽的！」伸出左邊大腿，褲十已破，鮮血直流，他即獨自前往繃帶室去裏紥，臨行的我握手道：</p>
<p>「不用洩氣，等着，俺馬上回來…」說着意氣洋洋地獨自去了。</p>
<p>我們都帶着鐵盔，不僅用來抵擋砲彈碎片，同時因爲初夏的野外，飛虫到處都是，鐵盔可以遮擋小虫。此刻的砲彈想是敵人兵艦上發來的，因為後面有小小的高丘，從這裏遠望不利，砲彈甚至往地下直鑽，我們的壕溝搖搖欲動，泥塊跳到和屋脊一樣高，砲彈口徑一定是蠻大的。但我們仍死守壕塹。我們奉命「不許敵人通過一匹，嚴重監視着。」</p>
<p>敵方出動戰車隊前來進攻，但敵方的戰軍非我敵手，我方有名的虎戰車，在我們的飾面眼光四射，迴轉着長大的砲身，一見了襲獲物，就發出震天怒吼。先前運輪子彈的輜重兵一人，携來了新的彈帶，我們的子彈早已射盡，只要前方的草稍微奇怪地搖動，就扳着槍機，所以子彈無論怎樣是不够的，一個同伴向輜重兵隊喊道：</p>
<p>「赫！威廉，幹麼這樣跟蹌！」</p>
<p>輜重兵隊站了起來，露出一副尷尬面孔道：</p>
<p>「湯姆（英國兵別名）賊種，老是釘着俺的卡車，呸！」</p>
<p>說着表示厭惡神氣。</p>
<p>卡車的運轉兵是不會誤事的，他們的卡車，往往被敵機發現，在低空用機關槍掃射，他們就不得不躲到道旁的地穴中去，但自身所運的彈藥和汽油，飾綫的將士是怎樣的等待着，他們知之有素。他們跨越彈痕纍纍的田舍道或者化爲廢墟的法國市鎮，不分畫夜繼績前進。</p>
<p>被呼作威廉的運輪兵又繼續先前的話這：</p>
<p>「被炸之後，俺歸於赤贊，恰巧逢到休似，俺回到故鄉時，俺家被敵機炸彈丟中，俺的手成了殘廢，所以現在影踪全無。但這也煞過了，賊敵現在回到這裏也好，唯一不忍的是妻子的信不見了，條爲的顧到卡車起火，收信之後，來不及讀，就趕緊把彈藥箱運到這裘來。」</p>
<p>「啊—呀，那是什麽，那邊什麽動？」</p>
<p>一個伙伴突然呌着，五發六發的子彈從槍口發出，如一串聯珠，向草業中飛去，但草業亳無反響，大概是風在作祟吧。</p>
<p>「那個小姑娘已經死了……」一個伙伴忽然挿嘴說道，壕塹中的對話原無層次的，只有斷片。</p>
<p>「你說什麼，那一個小姑娘？」</p>
<p>「那個迷途的法國小姑娘，怪可憐地。」</p>
<p>「這會兒留在戰塲幹什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「約摸一兩小時以前，有一個美麗小姑娘，年方十六歲，在附近徘徊逡巡，疲乏不堪，羞答答問我「我將往何處去？』法國的動民羣都從那邊的森林，逃到這織的森林，她在中路失散，所以哭泣。我對她道：「小媽子，德軍早已警告住民，立即退出戰區，你爲什麽不早早逃避？」她答道：「英美兵自稱前來解放我們的，所以我們以爲還是留在家裏好。」英美兵果然是解放者嗎，一味屠殺無辜，離人骨肉的解放者，把小姑娘的雙新，連人帶屋毀去，小姑娘一定還沒有知道。當她芷站着說話，敵人的戰門機突然在低參出現，浴在機槍掃射之中，小姑娘倒下來，就此不能動彈了。……」（譯自六月十九日朝日新聞柏林通訊）</p>
<h3>北法戰塲瑣聞</h3>
<p>茲將在柏林所聞的北法劇戰談片，摭拾二三，介紹如後。</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>……反動心的從軍記者和德國報道班員，對於麽開於諾曼第的戰鬥，皆以「地獄之戰」形容之，觀乎此，戰况如何激烈，不靴想像。反軸心軍的大艦隊和大羣的上陸用舟艇，突破密張如網的機雷原時，其情况即已大有可觀。至於反軸心的傘兵，羅美爾元帥曾說：「在這花圃的地面下，埋有八萬個地雷。它們在何處呢？恐怕神仙也不會知道吧。」降落在這花圃上，無異落入地獄的煉火中。實際上，反軸心的傘兵跳下飛機以後，大部分立刻界到極樂世界去了。</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>……在這次上陸戰中，尚未聽到反軸心軍使用新兵器的事。他們在哈伐附近雖以大羣的水陸兩用戰車登陸，但這並非新兵器。至於新戰法，也不過用降落傘擲下的人體等大的偶人而已。這樣的戰術，德方早已料到而予以警戒了。這些假傘兵或在着地時爆發，或在德兵走近時炸裂。總之，它們既是眩德軍之百的「偽裝」兵器，也是攻擊兵器。</p>
<p>但據一個成爲德重俘虜的英國機師——他曾駕駛一架滿載假傘兵的飛機——回億說：「我載着假傘兵飛到目的地上空。投下假傘兵時，須先拉開爆發裝置的信管。當我工作時，不料一個假傘兵突然爆發起來，共他也全部着火，我的飛機亦吐出熊熊的火焰，不得已祗好趕快用降落傘跳下來。比這再可怕的事恐怕是沒有的。</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>……從上陸的第一天起，英法海峽的空中昇起了許多氣球，高浮雲端。這是反軸心軍放出來觀測砲彈是否命中及共他情珍的。在它們的周圍，英美的戰鬥機不住盤旋翱翔，警戒着德國戰鬥機的攻擊，反軸心軍是如此動遇了一切代戰鬥工具，展開了決死的攻勢。可喜的是：在這樣的近代戰中，德軍軍中有着義勇志願的哥蕯克騎兵隊。他們跨着高頭駿馬，馳驅於諾曼第的平原上，殲滅已經落地的反軸心傘兵，揮舞有名的哥蕯克大刀，發揮自古以來的勇武精神。</p>
<p>其四</p>
<p>……還次上陸戰中，德方最擔憂的是怕軍用通信機關在反軸心軍的猛烈轟炸下失去效用。但實際上，反軸心軍的大型炸彈雖然命中了大西洋沿岸的要塞，而其內部却一些未被破壞，整個通信機關皆工作如常，毫無故障。此點正足表示德國建造要塞的按術非常優本（六月九日朝日新聞）（吉譯）</p>

<h3>小惠</h3>
<p>— 靑鹿</p>
<p>兒童病室裹收容的，都是些不幸的孩子。</p>
<p>軟骨病，肺炎，支氣管炎，膿胸，傷寒，膿瘡，……或是在馬路上給車輛壓傷了腿，在弄堂裹撞倒了誰的開水壺灼壞了手，……逍屋子裹川洗不息的從都市的各個角落裹送來了那些羸弱的哭喪着險的孩子們。</p>
<p>可是，他們在病房孩的時期大多不是頂長的，除了進院太遲或因着意外會遭到死亡的厄運外，大概都不過二三個月就嘻嘻哈哈的出院了，祗有四號床的小惠，居然住了一年多。</p>
<p>小惠還在去年春天因被貨軍壓斷了腿骨進院的，起光由於洗血過多，眞是危險，幸而劉醫生的手術高明，才把他從九死上生中救了回來；一個多月以前，替他除去了夾板，屆然也可以和平常孩子一標的自由走路了，這孩子眞運氣。</p>
<p>他剛進院的時候，是由一個工人模樣的父親伴送來的，預付了二百塊錢的醫藥費，此後，却從沒來　過他的孩子，三個月以後，爲了催繳不足的贊用，院方會一再寫信和派人去找他們的家屬，但當初那家屬留下的也許不是正確的地址，所以根本無法尋訪，問小轟自己，他祇知道「四馬路」，和爸爸呌「阿榮」，別的什麼也說不出來了。是才六歲的小孩呢！</p>
<p>大家的推測，孩子是不會有人來領走了，於是，就變樣留了下來。</p>
<p>孩子長得很體面，也挺聰明，祗是過去流浪街頭的生活給他沾染了不少的壞習慣；但，因着他的不幸，我們各班的護士都很愛憐他，常常和他談話，用廢紙寫了方塊字敎他認字，二個月中，倒識得了三百多個單字，在常識方面也有了顯著的進步。</p>
<p>根擄孩子不完全的談話，知道小惠定出身於貧窮得時常挨餓的勞慟者的家庭衷，父親是個沒有固定職業却又酗酒的苦力，一家都生活在不幸的漩過裏。</p>
<p>有一次我問小惠：</p>
<p>「你爸爸做什麽生意的？」</p>
<p>「爸爸有兩天出去做小工，有兩天不出去。」</p>
<p>「他喜歡你嗎？」</p>
<p>「不喜歡，」孩子閃着憂鬱的眼光說：「他一天到晚吃酒打人，還要趕我出去當小叫化子，要是不吃酒的日子，才有帶我到馬路上去白粗。」</p>
<p>「那麼媽？一定喜歡你的。」</p>
<p>「媽媽苦惱，爸爸天天向　要錢，不拿出來就打，媽媽生小妹妹不去搖紗，沒有錢給爸爸吃酒，又是打，媽媽就哭了。」</p>
<p>同情的淚水充滿在孩子的眼眶裹，於是我不忍再間下去了。</p>
<p>小惠夜能自由走路之後，白天就不再肯安靜地躺在床上了，就是午睡也要哄呀騙呀的抱上床去，有時小伴侶們給了他一片餅乾，或是一粒糖果，他會留着去哄騙別的哭泣的病孩，有時在小椅子上捧着一疊方塊字自己認眞地念，或是去轉教別的孩子們，病愈的小朋友出院了，他會跟着我們送客，天眞地說着「再會！來玩呀！」的客氣話，有些母親們知道他來歷的，訢見孩子伶俐，便也常有留下食物和玩具給他的。</p>
<p>這對於小惠是一種很好的鼓勵，使小惠更加肯學好了。</p>
<p>不久，十一號病床上却來了一個跌壞了左臂的十二歲的大孩子，可說是這半年來所收容的病孩中最淘氣的一個。他不但會鬧，而且常常和鄰近的孩子爭吵。說些不堪入耳的下流話，母親是位溺愛兒子的太太，每天乍前替他的孩子送菜肴和零食來，有時還帶來玩具，這樣使那個孩子在病房裏頭顯得很驕傲。</p>
<p>那一個孩子沒有好奇心呢？孩子們的注意集中在十一號，（我們對病孩習慣的編號構呼）小惠當然也免不了投射羨慕的眼光，或竟走上前去用手換摸他的活動火車，和他交換幾句孩子們的說話。</p>
<p>但十一號是越來越不成話了，有時慷慨地把東西送到別人，不一會又吵着要討還，有時爲了要不回別的孩子已經吃了的糖菓的餅乾，弄得大鬧大哭的，有一天更狂暴的舉起枕頭的茶杯來摔人，這使我們頻添了許多麻煩。</p>
<p>於是我們暗暗禁止別的孩子們和他接近，但二十多個孩子在一個大房間裏，有時眞是無能爲力的，何况，好奇是孩子的天性，敵不過新鮮玩兒的引誘，還是要過去，這說更增長了十一號　　　　。</p>
<p>果然，更壞的事情出現了。</p>
<p>那天下午，十一號的母親又帶來了幾樣玩具，小惠遙望了一會，到底挨過去瞧熱鬧了，那知道十一號竟指着小惠向他母親說：</p>
<p>「四號是沒爺娘收管的小難民，出了驚院只好做小癟三。」</p>
<p>小惠這一下氣得臉兒發靑，竟舉起手來打人了。</p>
<p>但，他沒有打着，自已的手已被別人抓住了狠命地咬了一口。</p>
<p>待我們聽到哭聲趕上去拉開時，小惠的手上已鮮血直流了。</p>
<p>事後，那位太太還上院長室去告發，使我們挨了一次臭駡。</p>
<p>從那天起，小惠竟變得呆了，圓圓的小臉上失去了活潑的嚴笑，老是默默地深思着什麼似的，無論怎麽逗他哄他都不能除去他的冷淡，他幼小的靈魂受了深重的打壟了，直到他手上的創傷痊愈了，還是不能回復他的可愛的天眞，</p>
<p>他厭惑這個環境了：</p>
<p>「姑姑：（孩子們對我們的通稱）我媽要來帶我回去了吧？」</p>
<p>我在無可奈何的困窘中，沒法不騙他：</p>
<p>「你媽過二天就要來接你了，還在替你買洋囡囡呢！」</p>
<p>我愛憐地撫着孩子的頭髮，難受地看見他那雙水汪汪的眼睛。</p>
<p>孩子當然沒法滿足的，天天來的祗是別人的母親，爲了堅持固執地想着自已的母親，他弄得無心認字，無心吃飯，給他一點東西的話，也祇能引起哭泣的孩子，也不再把識了的方塊字教給別人，母親們來帶病愈的孩子出院，他也不再親切的送另，祇是躲在屋角裏呆看。</p>
<p>半個月來，孩子萬得非常憔悴，小惠的憂鬱使我們擔心，我想，如果能尋訪到家屬的話，讓我把他送囘母親那兒去吧！</p>
<p>星期六下午空班，我偷俞地帶了小惠去找他的家，（這是犯院規的）可是從虞洽卿路走遍了「四馬路」直到外灘，孩子並不能指出那兒是他的家，更沒有碰到他的爸爸「阿榮」。</p>
<p>回來的路上，我替孩子買了一雙手套，二個桔子，小惠像是高與一點了，可是，一回去就塞到自己枕頭下面去了，因爲正不巧，又是一個孩子要出院了。</p>
<p>他又躲到屋角去呆望別人的母親。</p>
<p>第二天，孩子忽然病了，熱度很高，而且說着囈語：</p>
<p>「媽！你快來帶我回去呀！」</p>
<p>「阿爸別打了，我下次不敢啦！」</p>
<p>孩子的心靈，被重大的打擊所不安着，我站在床邊懷着憐憫瞧那正在夢中痛苦的沒有母親的小惠，不由自主的將嘴唇去吻那發着灼人的高熱的額角</p>
<p>在人間何世的悲慘世界裹，小惠給我帶來了沉重的時代的憂鬱。</p>
<h3>去學會了憎恨</h3>
<p>— 江水</p>
<p>我曾親眼看見</p>
<p>那粗暴的巨掌</p>
<p>有你底</p>
<p>小小的面頰上</p>
<p>印下了</p>
<p>暗紅的痕跡；</p>
<p>我曾親耳聽見</p>
<p>那拍拍的</p>
<p>木然的—</p>
<p>肉與肉的撞擊！</p>
<p>我也看見</p>
<p>你，苦命的孩子喲！</p>
<p>默默地</p>
<p>從地上爬了起來</p>
<p>默默地走了。</p>
<p>哭泣該充滿了</p>
<p>你底小小的心靈，</p>
<p>而人們也許會說</p>
<p>這是報應。</p>
<p>是誰呌你</p>
<p>去偷偷地摸人家籃子裏的東西？</p>
<p>爸？</p>
<p>媽？</p>
<p>還是別人？</p>
<p>八歲了吧？孩子</p>
<p>看上去</p>
<p>你也不會比這再大。</p>
<p>電車開了</p>
<p>打的你人早不知去向</p>
<p>你還站在這兒幹嗎？</p>
<p>這兒已沒有人再向你</p>
<p>投過同情的一望。</p>
<p>不要洗淚</p>
<p>不要詛咒</p>
<p>回去吧！孩子</p>
<p>—去學會被憎恨！</p>
<p>恨那些打你的人們。</p>
<p>去告訴爸</p>
<p>去告訴媽</p>
<p>也告訴別人。</p>
<p>讓爸爸組暴地罵人吧</p>
<p>讓媽媽暗暗地洗淚吧</p>
<p>孩子！</p>
<p>去學會了憎恨！</p>
<p>恨那些打你的人們</p>
<h3>友誼</h3>

<h3>煩惱與慾望</h3>
<p>— 張詩洲</p>
<p>千萬年來，芸芸英衆生的人類運用他那得天獨厚超宇宙的智力逐步地替他們自己創造了一個璨爛奪目的新世界——一個備極文明華塵的近代社會。</p>
<p>但究是什麽偉大的力量驅使他們完成這一偉火的工作呢？是　擊不絕永遠不會從人類的慾望之海中停止止長的種種無窮的慾望所推動究成的！千萬人將要這樣齋心地作唯一的回答。因爲沒右慾望，人類便沒進步！可是，歷來整個人類所感覺到最不舒服的「煩惱」（包括戰禍以及一切人為的災禍同人間的一切由人爲而引起的不快樂和不幸在內）却從這兒應運而生了！換句話說，他們雖因着他們自已的努力而享到文明的福，同時却也因此受到相等程度的煩惱時時糾纏的痛苦哩。</p>
<p>他們爲了要滿是自己各個不同的慾望，於是，發生了無數不可避免的利害衝突，這稱衝突漸漸地演到白熱化，終於互相爭論，對駡，打架。結果雙方都因爲自已美妙的理想受到意外的阻碍而發生痛切的不快，煩惱就在這一靈那中隨之發生。以上就是煩惱底由來。</p>
<p>近代頭腦淸晰的哲學家基於上述的理論，就開闢了一條新「律」。</p>
<p>煩惱與慾望底消長互成正比———暫學家們的新「律」。</p>
<p>我們如把這條新律用簡單的數學理論加以註釋，便可得到如下的一個結論。</p>
<p>如果慾望可能使他等於零，則煩惱也必等於零。慾望愈趨低微，煩惱也必定隨之減輕到同樣的程度。反之，人類的慾望愈趨高張，則隨後發生的煩惱決不會因此而遇到不增劇的例外的。</p>
<p>我們二十世紀的人頭，生活在這一個文明的世界上，種種的福是享得够了，但是，那可恨的煩惱却依舊隨時隨地來在他的殘性，時時打痛我們無辜的心田，這眞是不幸。我們爲减稍不必要的精神痛苦起見，我們賓應害制地把自已無謂的慾望抑制一下，就可把將要發作的煩惱抵消到九霄雲外去了。當不正當和過份的慾望在我們自知的心田中發作時，我們可果敢地這樣作，因爲這樣住住便可使自己成爲一個快樂和能自制的人！</p>
<p>朋友們！你們羨慕人家的西裝革履嗎？你們羡慕人家的洋樓大廈嗎？你們也羨慕人家的奢侈生活嗎？其賓他們並沒有什麼過份值得我們留意之處，他們正因此而受着不比你們輕的煩惱痛苦地糾纏着呢！</p>
<p>「知足者常樂」當成爲我們百年生活上的一　　　　　！</p>

<h3>防空司令部闡明　强化防空決意　違反防空規則將受軍法處罰</h3>
<p>上海市之防空態勢，自迭次施行防空訓練以來，雖已漸見進展，然距離理想成績尙遠。如本月三日實施訓練之際，違反規則者仍達相富多數。目下大陸方面戰事益見熾烈，尤以駐渝美空軍，自最近日軍進行雄偉之進攻作戰以來，前進基地已遭先後覆滅，乃不得不避免與日空軍作正面衝突，一意從事空中遊擊戰術，以圖擾亂和平地區人心。上海陸海軍防空司令部有鑒於此，決極力增强大上海市之防空態勢。</p>
<p>當局談話</p>
<p>查各項防空規則，尤以燈火管制業經屢次佈吿週知，並經數次發表警吿，喚起注意，然仍有多數人士，漢然無關，毫不關心，尤當空襲警報期間中，仍有洩漏燈火，甚至將直射光綫射出戶外，實至遺憾。此種行爲，實屬妨害軍事行動，故今後對該項違反規則者，除仍照舊予以停電處分外，並將按照軍法予以嚴厲處罰。凡本市居民，除應自行嚴格遵守規程外，並應近鄰相勗，互相督勵。各指導機關及自警團員等，亦應積極喚起注意，庶無一人受軍法處斷，有厚望焉。特於六日發布吿示，並發表談話，闡明當局强化防空之決意。今後凡有違反防空規定者，將按照軍法嚴厲處罰，尤其對於違反燈火管制者，除予以停電處分外，並將一律同樣處罰。</p>
<p>重要吿示</p>
<p>上海陸海軍防空司令部吿示：為佈吿事，查今後凡有違反各項防空規則者，尤以在空襲警報期間中，洩漏燈光者，將以妨害大日本軍軍事行動論罰，除根據昭和十八年九月二十日吿示規定停止供電外，並將按照軍法嚴厲處罰，合亟布吿週知此佈。</p>
<h3>工商聯誼會昨舉行　時局座談會　松島部長闡述太平洋戰局</h3>
<p>本市工商聯誼會爲使工商界對時局深切瞭解起見，特於昨（六）日下午五時半假華懋飯店舉行茶會，邀請本市工商異領袖舉行時局座談會即席請監隊報道部長松島大佐，對目前太平洋戰局加以關釋。並由本報分送出席人員大東亞新形勢圖一張及馬利亞納海戰書一冊。茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>茶會情况</p>
<p>艦隊報道部長松島大佐准時偕同鹽田大尉蒞會，中日工商界領袖計到日本方面船津辰一郞，栗本寅治，市橋彥二，川口憲上等，中國方面聞蘭亭，林康侯，吳蘊齋，江上達，許力求，陳紹嫣，許冠羣，項康原，裴雲卿，沈嗣良，顧南羣，王伯元，陳日平，金宗城，許曉初，陳彬會，任雲鵬等，滿映明星李香蘭小姐亦參加，共二百餘人。首由聞蘭亭主席致詞後，即請松島部長對目前太平洋戰局加以闡述繼由各代表提出問題多項，均經部長逐一解答後，放映時事電影：　威風堂堂之聯合艦隊，　河南戰況，　前綫拉巴爾戰況，末由滿映明星李香蘭小姐淸唱巾日名歌二曲，至七時半始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>首由主席聞蘭亭氏致詞：「我們工商界平時雖然彼此在業務上常常往來，可是集團見面的機會極少，同時我們雖然終日處理各自的業務，都很忙碌，而對於目前緊張的時局，亦非常關心，今天特請艦隊報道部長松島大佐，報吿最近馬利亞納羣島海戰的情况，想爲各位所最歡迎的。」</p>
<p>松島致詞</p>
<p>今天承諸位在百忙中冒暑光臨，實不勝感謝。世界戰局的動向，在歐洲及太平洋兩方面，決戰態勢日益明顯。在今後的戰局中，中日兩國人民，不能不更加緊團結，打破一切困難，以獲得最後勝利</p>
<p>使中日兩國人民，熟悉戰局的實際情形，而互相諒解應該在那一方面協力，實最爲必要。今天這會的意義就在於此。</p>
<p>本日的集會，承工商聯誼會，盡力協助，特此致謝。</p>
<p>今天是座談會，希望在座諸位隨便交換意見，以期對於時局，增加認識</p>
<p>第一，對於戰爭，現在有許多反宣傳流行着。這種反宣傳的流行，是上海的特色，也是一種滑稽。但對於經濟上，思想上，因種種意義，而有極大的不良影饗，可能使一般人爲之迷惑。其間很多是敵央美方面的宣傳，當此時局嚴重之時，應特別注意揭穿這種反宣傳。</p>
<p>第二，因敵方宣傳而受到影響的人似乎很多。敵方的宣傳都是非常不準確的，依其所發表的損害可以明白。但也有人祇聽敵人的宣傳，而倌以為　。今後我們如有機會，希望常常舉行座談會，使大家明白戰局的眞相。</p>
<p>第三，現在的太平洋作戰與巾國大陸作戰，有着密切的關係，其目的都在擊滅英美，尤其關於大陸作戰，如日昨日本政府的聲明，對中國人民並無何等戰爭行爲。我們很明白東亞民族長長此相爭下去，是件愚蠢事。這一點相信重慶當局也很知道的，我們所應注意的，是英美利用此機會坐收漁人之利</p>
<p>第四，現在太平洋的戰事，愈成爲敵方總反攻的態勢，激戰極烈。爲了獲得最後勝利起見，我們正在用各種手段以擊破敵的戰力。在塞班方面所獲的戰果，實極鉅大。擊沈擊毀的航空母艦，達半數以上。前綫將士的奮戰，使敵人大感困惱，在海軍的戰略上，充分完成了目的。美國海軍部次長福萊斯泰氏五日對新開紀者稱，塞班島的損失，出於意料可見一斑。敵人的作戰目的，是想在中國大陸上獲得立足點，作最後決戰。我們爲了克盡守護東亞的使命，不惜挺身奮鬥到底。請諸位辨識敵人的反宣傳，盡力協助。堅定完遂大東亞勝利的信念。</p>
<p>解答問題</p>
<p>嗣由松島部長對於出席人員的發問，逐一解答如次：問：萬一塞島不守，戰局前途將如何？</p>
<p>答：日軍在塞班島方面的戰術是誘敵深入，加以殲滅。塞島即使陷落，對大陸戰局，並無重大影響。且塞班島爲一極小島嶼，並沒有艦隊根據地，日軍方面，只要使塞班島上之敵航空基地不能利用，盡力加以破壞，即已完成目的。且日軍更有新幾內亞，菲律賓等基地，不足爲慮。問：敵美於獲得立足點後，是否能繼續推進？答：敵人企圖以塞班島作爲其對日空襲之根據地，但日軍已盡力加以破壞，使之不能成功。查塞班島長僅二十四里，闊十二里，即使全被敵人利用，其範團也至爲狹小，決不像中國大陸之重要。同時，？海軍艦隊作戰，極爲愼重，爲防第二方面之敵英艦隊，故尤出之以嚴密，敵美曾大肆宣傳，謂日本海軍已被擊潰，其說是否可靠，不久當有事實證明。</p>
<p>問：瑪利亞納羣島在大東亞戰爭中的重要性？</p>
<p>答：按該處海面，小島頗多，日軍早已料到敵人必將出全力來襲，早有萬全準備，待敵到來，即予以痛擊。目前瑪利亞納島附近，敵方並無多大兵力，僅航空母艦數艘及保護航空母艦之巡洋艦而已，並無正規艦隊。</p>
<p>不久以前，敵以一部份機動部隊來襲琉璜與小笠原羣島，但據大本營本日十七時三十分發表：關於此次來襲之敵機動部隊，已被日軍還擊，於四日午後逃逸，在此役中擊落敵機七十四架以上，船舶五艘，我方亦損失飛機三十架。</p>
<p>關於日海軍之戰術，其策略在將敵軍誘至本土附近而加以擊滅，這是最巧妙的一種戰術，無論敵人進攻小笠原島也好，或琉璜島也好，都不足懼。</p>
<p>現在更就海軍作戰根本原則一談。此次作戰，不論方式如何，祗有兩個原則，即孫子兵法所謂「先制」與「集中」，先制是先發制人，集中是集中全力。在大戰開始前，日軍差不多佔有全海域的島嶼，其目的在驅逐敵軍於大東亞區域之外，而確保南方之資源，並與中國大陸取得聯絡，以增强日本之戰力。現在的目的何在？則在期待敵軍到來，而予以擊滅，在戰略上講：是不得不如此的。</p>
<p>在南太平洋的日軍前進基地，知道敵軍必來反攻，故早加防備，待機破敵，然後更誘敵深入，而一鼓殲滅。所以日軍對敵人之愈接近日本本土，非特不生憂慮，反而歡迎，如前次在硫璜島附近有航空母艦兩艘（在二萬七千噸以上）及巡洋艦兩艘被繫沉，即是施用此種巧妙戰術的結果。</p>
<p>目前日本所最關心的是敵人企圖利用中國大陸，日本無論如何？必不使敵人在中國火陸上陸。</p>
<p>問：小笠原羣島的形勢如何？</p>
<p>答：小笠原羣島是日軍的航空基地，也是日軍的防禦基地，敵若來進犯，將遭日軍之痛擊，因從該島至日本，飛行時間僅一小時即達，故敵人即使進犯亦不足懼。</p>
<p>答：今後敵軍，必將出全力以奪取塞班島，如塞班島失守，則將進窺日本本土，中國大陸或菲律濱。不過敵人之補給路綫交將隨之延長，此乃與日方極端有利的。</p>

        <h1>1944.07.07</h1>
<h3>Another Grave Lesson</h3>
<p>Regarding the import of rice into this city, the requisition system was implemented on July 1st. According to a report published yesterday by the Rice Control Association, in the three days from July 1st to the 3rd, the amount requisitioned was only 30 shi. Eleven shi were requisitioned on each of the first and second days, and this was reduced to six shi on the third day. However, the quantity transported in actually increased on the third day compared to the first two days. The black market price of rice rose day by day. We have listed the figures from the Association’s report in the table below for comparison, to give a glimpse of the situation:</p>
<p>Date   Quantity Transported In   Quantity Requisitioned   Rice Price</p>
<p>July 1st   4154 shi   12 shi   10,600 yuan</p>
<p>July 2nd   4530 shi   12 shi   11,200 yuan</p>
<p>July 3rd   5263 shi   6 shi   11,200 yuan</p>
<p>July 4th   5683 shi   Unclear   12,300 yuan</p>
<p>From the figures in the table above, the following are noteworthy: The quantity transported in increased daily, while the quantity requisitioned decreased, forming an inverse proportion. The quantity requisitioned accounts for only one or two per thousand of the quantity transported in. Compared to the stipulated 30 percent, it is pitifully small. The price of rice rose day by day (On June 30th, the price of rice was 9,700 yuan; according to the actual black market price, it was even higher than this). Even calculating the requisition price at the highest price of 3,200 yuan, it is four times lower than the black market price and twice lower than the price at the place of origin (6,500 yuan in Qingpu and Songjiang).</p>
<p>First, why did the quantity transported in increase daily while the quantity requisitioned decrease? Because the requisition price is too low, not even covering costs, let alone a reasonable profit. Therefore, people are trying to avoid requisition as much as possible, breaking up large quantities into smaller ones.</p>
<p>Second, why did the price of rice rise day by day? Because the requisition price is too low, not even covering costs. As a result, losses incurred in the requisitioned portion are recouped in the freely traded portion, to offset the losses.</p>
<p>Therefore, we can say that the current requisition methods and prices are still unreasonable, only serving to stimulate price increases and further exacerbate the rice problem. Those responsible for rice control should deeply reflect on these facts and not turn a blind eye.</p>
<p>An editorial in the News Report on the 5th of July pointed out that, according to the "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice Consumption in Beijing and Shanghai" and the "Administrative Measures for Rice Consumption Management in Shanghai," the main purpose of rice requisition was to correct the unreasonableness of past low-price purchases and should be based on cost plus a reasonable profit, thereby increasing the quantity purchased, replenishing supplies, and suppressing the black market. We also believe that this is indeed the intent of the government's legislation. However, why does the requisition price currently being implemented disregard costs and reasonable profits, resulting in a reduction in the quantity requisitioned and a sharp rise in black market rice prices, a phenomenon that is becoming increasingly difficult to control? We cannot help but feel completely perplexed by such measures taken by the Rice Control Association.</p>
<p>Moreover, the original intention was to increase purchases to replenish supplies, but the opposite is now happening. In three days, only 30 shi were requisitioned. May we ask, can these 30 shi of rice "replenish supplies"? If we calculate based on a population of five million in Shanghai, with 300,000 grains of rice per dou (some have counted approximately 3,000 grains per he. The "Qi Min Yao Shu" states that there are over 51,000 grains per dou of unhusked grain), then 30 shi of rice contains 90 million grains. In three days, each person can be allocated 18 grains of rice. May we ask, does such a requisition help the people's food supply? Does it help public grain reserves? Even a three-year-old child knows it is completely useless. However, in order to requisition these 30 shi of rice, the price of rice has increased by 1,500 yuan per shi in three days (based on the figures in the published report; the actual increase is even higher). Assuming each person consumes 1.5 dou of rice per month, that's 1.5 sheng in three days, resulting in an increased burden of 22.5 yuan. In other words, the citizens have already paid a price of 22.5 yuan to obtain 18 grains of rice that have not yet been allocated. Is this measure beneficial to the people or harmful to them?</p>
<p>We do not wish to quote out of context or criticize harshly, but we genuinely feel the seriousness of the people's food problem, which absolutely cannot withstand further stimulation. Moreover, the decision to implement the requisition method by the Rice Control Association is a major measure. Has it been approved by the government? Has it been discussed in a full committee meeting? If it is merely based on the subjective opinions of a few people, rashly decided, it is inevitably suspected of being taken lightly.</p>
<p>We argued in our editorial on July 4th that, after the recent reorganization of the Commerce Control Association, the Rice Control Association is one of its five subordinate committees, with the authority and responsibility to guide and supervise. Therefore, the Commerce Control Association should be jointly responsible for the measures of the Rice Control Association. Requisition is no longer appropriate given the current timing and actual situation. The current Rice Control Association should be reorganized as soon as possible to carry out its closing work, while focusing all efforts on preparing for the rice control work during the autumn harvest. How to learn from past failures, how to consider the current environment, and how to formulate a reasonable plan to avoid digging a well only when thirsty and taking measures that are completely misguided, causing hardship to the people. Of particular importance is that the Commerce Control Association should carefully select suitable personnel with experience, credibility, historical connections in the rice industry, and integrity to take charge. Now, we further propose that the Commerce Control Association should immediately assume its guidance and supervision responsibilities and abolish the current untimely requisition method. The problem is serious, and the timing is urgent, leaving no room for hesitation, to alleviate the suffering of the people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Mobile Unit Fled After Failing to Attack Iwo Jima and Other Islands; Japanese Forces Shot Down Over 74 Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 6th that the enemy mobile unit that attacked Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands was driven away by the defending Japanese forces on the afternoon of July 4th. In this battle, over 74 enemy aircraft were shot down, while the Japanese forces lost 30 aircraft and five ships.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese base in the central Pacific reported that enemy mobile units and carrier-based aircraft attacked Iwo Jima on the 3rd and 4th and Chichi-jima on the 4th. The Japanese forces stationed on Chichi-jima shot down 20 of the hundreds of enemy aircraft that repeatedly attacked. Furthermore, the report that enemy cruisers and destroyers bombarded Chichi-jima on the 4th was a false report. The enemy forces only bombarded Iwo Jima with naval guns on the 4th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese base in the central Pacific reported that enemy aircraft attacked Miyakojima on the 4th. The Japanese forces stationed there engaged them and shot down 19 aircraft. The Japanese side suffered very light damage. Furthermore, 15 enemy aircraft attacked Yap Island on the 5th. The Japanese forces stationed there destroyed five aircraft and repelled the attack. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft crashed, but the pilot landed safely.</p>
<h3>Saipan Island Enters Decisive Battle Stage</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 5th that the battle of Saipan Island has now entered an extremely critical stage. The announcement reads as follows: Since the 15th of last month, the enemy, under the cover of intense artillery and aerial bombardment, attempted to land with amphibious tanks. Both attempts were annihilated by Japanese forces on the coast. During the enemy's third landing attempt, Japanese forces destroyed over ten enemy tanks. Because the enemy consolidated their positions in the streets of Garapan, on the southern slopes of Mount Tapochau, and in the northwest area, the enemy concentrated artillery fire and attacked Mount Tapochau starting on the 23rd. At the same time, they gradually advanced a strong tank force from the east coast. Although the Japanese forces fought bravely, they were forced to abandon the summit of Mount Tapochau (474 meters above sea level), the highest peak on Saipan Island, on the 26th. After being subjected to concentrated artillery and aerial bombardment by the enemy, the mountain's appearance has changed drastically in just ten days, which shows how fierce the fighting was. After capturing the summit of Mount Tapochau, the enemy immediately used it as a spearhead and attacked the strategic point of Tanapag on the east coast with a strong force. The fighting became even more fierce on the 28th. At that time, Japanese forces seized the opportunity to launch counterattacks, or charged into enemy positions as scouts, or used a small amount of artillery fire to attack the Aslito airfield that the enemy had begun to use, continuing the bloody battle. As such, the battle line gradually shifted to the northeastern end of the island. Although the Japanese forces have now been forced to the foothills of Mount Achugao, located six kilometers from the north coast of the island, the army and navy soldiers and the remaining residents are still fighting to the death. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. Although the enemy headquarters has not yet announced the figures, it is estimated that the enemy's losses since landing until the 30th have reached over 10,000. The enemy's landing force was approximately two or three divisions, and half of them have been annihilated. However, Japanese losses have also gradually increased. They are currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a superior enemy force. The Japanese soldiers' fierce struggle will continue to resist with the great spirit of sacrificing themselves, even if only one soldier remains. The battle line is currently in a chaotic state, and the battle has reached a critical period.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces South of Conghua Form Encirclement; Fierce Fighting Continues</h3>
<p>Japanese Forces Somewhere, 6th (Central News Agency) - Japanese units advancing north along the Yuehan Railway have now eliminated the resistance of Chongqing forces on both sides of the railway and are continuing to advance. Meanwhile, a Japanese unit pursuing the defeated remnant forces west of the Yuehan Railway broke through the strong positions of the Chongqing forces and captured Bijia Mountain (1.5 kilometers east of Qingyuan) and Guanyin Ridge (2 kilometers northwest of Qingyuan). They are currently pursuing the Chongqing forces attempting to retreat north of the Beijiang River. In addition, another unit, in order to coordinate with them, also captured Baishikou (1 kilometer west of Qingyuan) on the evening of the 4th. A unit of Japanese forces advancing north east along the Yuehan Line formed an encirclement in the mountainous area south of Conghua on the 3rd. On the 4th, they placed the county town of Conghua within the encirclement. Operations in that area are currently continuing fiercely.</p>
<p>Residents of Shaoguan and Yingde Evacuate</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press dispatch from a special correspondent in Chongqing, the situation on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts is as follows: The progress of the war in China is increasingly favorable to the Japanese forces. Hengyang is currently surrounded by Japanese forces on all sides. The Chongqing forces' route of retreat to the southwest has been cut off, but they are still holding the city to the death. Japanese heavy artillery bypassed Leiyang, located 60 kilometers south of Hengyang, and advanced to the southern outskirts of the city, about 80 kilometers south of Hengyang on the Yuehan Line. As for the Japanese forces advancing north from the Guangzhou area, they are currently divided into three routes, advancing towards Qingyuan (70 kilometers northwest of Guangzhou), Conghua (40 kilometers northeast), and Longmen (40 kilometers northeast). The Japanese forces advancing along a wide front of over 100 kilometers on both sides of the Yuehan Line are simultaneously advancing. The vanguard units of the Japanese forces advancing south from Hunan and the vanguard units of the Japanese forces advancing north from northern Guangdong Province are only about 300 kilometers apart. Most of the 1,100-kilometer Yuehan Line from Guangzhou to Hankou is in the hands of the Japanese forces. The only areas not yet occupied are Shaoguan and Yingde to its south. The Chongqing forces are currently planning to use these two key locations to prevent the Japanese forces from advancing north. Furthermore, the Japanese forces in the Hengyang area are likely to attack to the southwest. The Chongqing authorities are forcing the residents of important cities such as Guilin, Shaoguan, and Yingde to evacuate in preparation for a Japanese attack. Large-scale evacuations have begun along the Jinghan and Yuehan Railways in Henan and Hunan provinces. The movement of the population is reminiscent of the mass movement of residents from the coastal provinces to the interior during the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Guilin has recently become a transit point for refugees from Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. Now, even the people of Guilin are busy evacuating. Because the evacuating citizens are abandoning their homes and possessions, carrying only cash with them, merchandise cannot be sold, and prices have plummeted. It is reported that the Chongqing forces are currently dismantling a section of the Xiang-Gui Railway from Hengyang to Guilin.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Fiercely Attack on the Hunan Front</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing government released a war report on the Hunan and Guangdong fronts late on the 5th, stating that fierce fighting continues in various locations on the Hunan front around Hengyang. On the evening of the 3rd, the Japanese forces continued their fierce attacks along the entire line under the cover of heavy artillery fire. The Chongqing forces also used air force and artillery fire for cover and defense. A bitter battle is currently unfolding along the entire line. The Chongqing forces on both sides of the Xiang River launched counterattacks against the advancing Japanese forces. Japanese forces south of Leiyang advanced to Feijiang, 20 kilometers from the city. The Chongqing forces engaged them. The Chongqing forces are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces along the entire front line. On the Guangdong front, after the Japanese forces occupied Longjiang on the 3rd, the Chongqing forces counterattacked that night and are engaged in fighting on the east and west outskirts of Qingyuan.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Chongqing and American forces are making low-altitude flights with B-25 bombers to drop weapons and ammunition to the garrison troops in Hengyang, which is completely surrounded by Japanese forces, in an attempt to prevent the city from falling.</p>
<p>Chongqing-U.S. Air Force Adopts Defensive Posture</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Frontline Base, 6th (Central News Agency) - The main operational goal of the Japanese Air Force stationed in China is to attempt to achieve results. Today, the Japanese military’s operations in China are achieving significant results, and this shift signifies that the Japanese military will initiate a major offensive. Because the Japanese land forces are entering the perimeter of the Chongqing-U.S. air bases from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, they first plan to seize the Hengyang airfield. The Japanese air fleet will then advance its base to sever the connections between Suichuan, Jian'ou, Ganzhou, and Ji'an, thereby abandoning its past posture and completing a large-scale offensive. It is reported that the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, facing a reversal of the situation, is adopting a defensive posture and attempting to temporarily retreat to Guilin, reorganize its forces, and then attempt to make a move. However, the power of the Japanese land forces can still threaten Guilin, so the commander of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, General Chennault, has decided to abandon Guilin and retreat further to Kunming. This proves that Chennault's plan for air raids against Japan has been completely thwarted. As the war progresses, Hengyang and Guilin will soon be captured. The Japanese Air Force will advance to Kunming, the base of the Chongqing Air Force, annihilate the 14th Air Force, which is invading Asia, and shatter its ambitions. The Japanese military's grand strategic plan is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Burma Special Investigation Mission Arrives in Nanjing by Plane; Foreign Minister Chu Holds Special Banquet in Reception</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Burmese special investigation mission, consisting of six members led by Dr. Ba Han, arrived in Nanjing by plane on the 6th to study China's construction status and cultural undertakings.

<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Speaks on the Sino-Japanese Statement: Cooperation and Co-prosperity with Allies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the 5th of this month, the Japanese government issued a statement to proclaim its confidence in victory. Our government also issued a statement on the same day to express the purpose of returning to the capital. As a result, deeper cooperation between China and Japan to jointly complete the war, defeat Britain and the United States, and protect East Asia is of profound significance. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government issued the following statement on this matter: The Japanese government issued a statement on the 5th of this month to proclaim its confidence in victory and strongly stated that the purpose of this operation is only to destroy the aggression and hegemonic ambitions of Britain and the United States. If the Chongqing troops refuse to collude with Britain, they will not be treated as enemies. Furthermore, Japan's hopes for the Republic of China are to respect China's independence and autonomy based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, in order to achieve an eternal relationship of good neighborliness and friendship between China and Japan. From this, we can more clearly understand the true intentions of our ally Japan towards China. Therefore, our government also issued a statement expressing the purpose of returning to the capital, which is to promote peace and national unity, complete the East Asian War, so that China's freedom and independence can be established as soon as possible, and further develop the strength of an independent country to stabilize East Asia. After this statement by China and Japan, all our countrymen should understand the goodwill of our ally Japan towards our country and its hope that our country, as a member of East Asia, will share the responsibility of protecting East Asia, so that Japan can devote all its efforts to completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Since Japan is so sincere, how should our country be brave and progressive to cooperate with our ally Japan, and with the determination to live and die together, to achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity? It is deeply hoped that Chongqing can understand the greater righteousness, return to the fold as soon as possible, turn hostility into friendship, and jointly overthrow Britain and the United States, who are invading East Asia, and move forward together on the path of reviving China and protecting East Asia. This is not only the expectation of the people of the whole country, but also the sympathy of our ally Japan.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Foreign Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - Today is the anniversary of the July 7th Incident. Foreign Minister Li of Manchukuo issued a statement on the current situation and the Chongqing's erroneous continuation of the war, as follows: The Sino-Japanese Incident, amid the fierce progress of the Greater East Asia War, coincides with the 7th anniversary. Thanks to the brave and tenacious fighting of the Japanese army, enemy bases of the US and Britain have now been lost, and the construction of a new order and the establishment of a co-prosperity sphere are progressing step by step. The countries of Greater East Asia are all shouldering the heavy responsibility of building a co-prosperity sphere and moving towards the path of completing the war. Under the assistance of Japan, all construction in our country is progressing rapidly. Our ally, the Republic of China, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, is developing its national strength and expanding the peaceful areas. At the same time, it is working hard on construction and improving the lives of the people, and the economy is becoming more prosperous. The economic new system under the National Government's decisive battle has been as solid as a rock. In the military field, it is also becoming increasingly stronger, and it has a number of elite land and naval forces, standing on the front line of peaceful nation-building. At the same time, it is cooperating with the Japanese army to destroy the enemy US and Britain and establish a glorious cause. The people in the resistance areas have mostly awakened to peaceful nation-building and are returning to the peaceful areas one after another. Today, the resistance camp is gradually collapsing. And places such as Luoyang and Changsha, which were boasted as resistance bases, have all fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. At this time, if the resistance camp continues to fight without regard for the friendship of a common culture and race, it is extremely foolish.</p>
<h3>Japanese Science and Technology Groups Hold Joint Conference to Study New Weapons and Enhance Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government, in order to gather the essence of national science and technology and jointly devote efforts to the research of combat technology to enhance combat power, specially established the Technology Institute last November. In addition, the Japan Science and Technology Group Federation has also mobilized hundreds of thousands of scientists to engage in the invention and creation of new weapons. Therefore, Japan's national movement to promote decisive battle science and technology has been launched throughout the country. Furthermore, the Technology Institute, the National Science and Technology League, the Science Society, the Science Association, and other organizations held a joint conference of Japanese science and technology groups at the Marunouchi Hotel here on the 5th to discuss various specific matters. According to the Creative Division of the Technology Institute, since its establishment on November 1st last year, it has received 7,356 invention proposals from the public until June this year. Among these cases, those related to decisive battle weapons account for 60% of the total. The majority of these are new researches on aircraft. This point also shows the public's concern for aviation weapons. The remaining 40% are new inventions related to enhancing production. In addition, the most outstanding 535 cases out of all the cases have been awarded commendations to the inventors by the Technology Institute in March and June respectively. At the same time, trial production has begun, and many of them have been completed, making great contributions to strengthening combat power. However, as the war situation becomes more severe, the emergency mobilization of the scientific community is even more urgent. Therefore, the Technology Institute is the main body, gathering 150 academic societies and associations across the country to thoroughly mobilize all scientists in the country, with a view to further promoting the invention and creation of all the people. It is also planned that by the end of October, these cases will be collected, categorized, and forwarded by the Technology Institute to the military authorities and relevant government agencies, as well as various production factories. In addition to specialists engaging in specialized research, it is also expected that ordinary people can also conduct research, so as to achieve the practical effect of mobilizing all scientists in the country, and contribute to new weapons and the necessary technology for enhancing production.</p>

<h3>Volleyball League Opens This Weekend - A Discussion of the Men's and Women's Division A Teams</h3>
<p>This year's volleyball league has five teams in Division A, twenty-two teams in Division B, and six teams in Division A for women. It will begin on the 9th of this month. It is expected that this volleyball competition, following football and basketball, will once again cause a sensation. Taking advantage of this opening, we will introduce the strengths of the Division A and women's teams to promote it, which will surely increase interest and be welcomed by fans.</p>
<p>Heroines</p>
<p>Sansheng - This team is more dedicated to volleyball than basketball. Looking at its strength, it is indeed extraordinary. There are many strong players under its command, who are capable and experienced. Their strong and healthy posture does not give way to men. Players such as Shi Ruijuan, who is experienced, Li Bo, who supports the team, Chen Meizhen, who makes sudden attacks, and Chen Liuzhen, who strikes fiercely, are famous in the volleyball scene and have enjoyed fame for a long time. Moreover, this team practices very hard and is willing to put in hard work. The front, middle, and rear rows are well connected. This team has great ambitions for the championship in this session. As the saying goes, "Where there is a will, there is a way." We hope that Captain Shi and others will work hard and be able to achieve their wishes.</p>
<p>Zhiqian - Combines veteran players and newcomers into one team. Zhang Jiazhen, Shao Tiao, and Zhu Shifang are veterans in the volleyball world. Zhang Minyu, Xu Wei, and Zhu Ruiying are promising newcomers. It is now heard that Tan Yongqi has been invited to guide them. They are working hard at the Shanghai Girls' High School volleyball court and have great ambitions. In the future, when they compete for the top spot, this team of women should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Huayan - Organized by the Huayanli Association in Zhangjia Garden, it has a history of six years. This team initially did not focus on trophies, and did not care about gains and losses. They play sports for the sake of sports, so they are highly regarded by the general public. However, in recent years, they have participated in more battles, gained experience, and their results have been improving day by day. People like Zhu Zhipei and Peng Guoying can indeed be squeezed into the first-class talents. Moreover, with Xu Lingxian commanding from the middle, their reputation is increasing day by day. On the day of the end of this league, this team will surely be able to...</p>
<p>Green Team - After winning the basketball and round gateball championships, this time they also have the intention to try their hand at volleyball. According to reporters, their lineup includes Huang Xingfen and Zhu Yinlan in the front row, Huang Mingyuan, Wang Weizhen, and Liu Zhenshi in the middle row, and Xiang Yulin, Yang Wenjuan, and Rong Shujian in the back row. They are all known for their agility and are worthy of being all-rounders. Moreover, newcomers such as Zhu Chengran, Yan Weiwen, Zhang Minzhi, and Li Yunzhi have achieved excellent results under good guidance. Therefore, this team does not seem to have the ambition of Sansheng and Zhiqian. At the very least, they threaten all teams and have good results. It is uncertain whether they will win unexpectedly. It is not hopeless to win the silver shield again! Strive for it!</p>
<p>The remaining two teams are Western teams, the Western Youth and the Soviet Union. Among them, the Western Youth has strong overall strength, but because they are accustomed to American rules, the Chinese Youth court may not have much development. In short, the four Chinese women's teams in this session are all known to be strong and will surely be among the best in the future. I hope that good people will think that they can all show their strengths and shine.</p>
<p>Male Athletes</p>
<p>Huaying - Since receiving the influence of Tan Yongzhan, the former Far East representative, and the return of Li Baozhong and other generals from the north, as well as the assistance of basketball master Li Zhenzhong, its momentum has greatly increased, and it is no longer the Wu Xia Amon of the past. Tan and the two Lis all have unique skills, which are the key to the team's scoring. It is a pity that Tan Yongzhan was once a figure who dominated the scene and was invincible. His agility is still lingering. Although he is now older, he is still sharp and his charm is enough to compete with young women. It is especially gratifying that he is willing to patiently teach other team members, so Huaying may have a satisfactory performance.</p>
<p>Yuehua - Has the most complete talent, such as Guo Bingkun, Mai Bingyao, Zheng Jichang, Han Ruoyu, Yu Zouzi, Ma Canxi, and Chen Xuechong, each with their own specialties. Among them, Guo Bingkun's fierce hammering, Mai Bingyao's blocking and counter-扣, and Yu Zouzi's good use of wit are beyond the reach of other teams. If there are no unexpected changes in this team, then winning the championship is likely to be the case today, who else but me!</p>
<p>White Team - Although it has a long history, it has not been able to achieve special results. This team has always focused on connecting emotions and has never had any intention of wooing players. In the end, with the return of Wang Deyuan and his brothers, Cheng Dui, Zhang Xianlun, Qu Xineng, Chen Zuoliang, and other strong players, the talent is relatively complete. They will surely have better skills to show us.</p>
<p>There are also two teams, the Soviet Union and the Russian Overseas Chinese, which are organized by Russians. They are strong and have a considerable foundation in volleyball. In the future, there may be upsets. Our Chinese teams should not underestimate them.</p>
<h3>Football Season Ends; Small Ball League Produced</h3>
<p>The Small Football Federation of this city has initiated and hosted the first small ball league. There are as many as 180 teams registered to participate, setting a rare record for the number of teams in the opening game. They are divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D. Because there are too many teams joining, each group is further divided into several divisions. After the championships of each division are produced in the future, the overall championship will be determined. A competition committee has been specially established to preside over the matter. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Tan Xi (Chairman), Zhang Baokui, Shen Huichun, Deng Xiaoliang, Qian Weilie, Chen Jixiang, Huang Renyi.</p>
<p>The competition venues will also be held in five places to facilitate the rapid progress of the competition.</p>
<p>Shanghai Youth Friendship Association - Xingguo Road (Leishangda Road). 72 Huashan Road (Haige Road).</p>
<p>Xuhui School Iron Field - Xujiahui Xuhui Middle School.</p>
<p>Tongle Ball Field - Yongjia Road (West Aihans Road) Yeyang Road (Qiqi Road).</p>
<p>Aurora University Ball Field - Lingshi Road. (Lüban Road)</p>

<p>Jingwu - Russian Physical Education A (A2) 4:20 Li Guoyi</p>
<p>India - Ronghua (D4) 5:30 Jin Jiabiao</p>
<p>Sansheng - German Chamber of Commerce (A3) 6:40 Chen Jixiang</p>
<p>In Group A2, Jingwu vs. Russian Physical Education A, both sides have famous football players, and there will be many exciting moments. Jingwu was newly established last month and openly recruited players. Many people joined, including Dong Qun, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Chen Mingzhe, and Han Longgen. Tao Ziming, Tao Tingfu, Shen Jind, Zhao Yongfang, and others are all veterans of the arena, so the lineup is solid and the combat power is strong.</p>
<p>Russian Physical Education A is organized by Russian athletes, just like a police force. Players such as Savin, En Bifev, Shang, and Zhuoluntev are all brave and good at fighting. Their strength is no less than that of Jingwu. When the two heroes meet for the first time, a battle of dragons and tigers will be difficult to predict who will win.</p>
<p>Sansheng is a rising star. It won the overall championship of Group C of the Shanghai League Football this year. This time, it is participating in Group A of the small ball league. With its tacit cooperation and enthusiasm for football, it will surely achieve excellent results. All the young players are like dragons and tigers, and Jin Lusheng's agility is even more rare. The team's defensive skills are impeccable.</p>
<p>The German Chamber of Commerce is the German team, with famous Northern European players Xu Erzhu, Fu En, and the Pantuosun brothers assisting in the battle, which is not ordinary. When they meet Sansheng tomorrow, there will be a fierce competition, and the fiery battle situation can be expected.</p>
<p>Attached is the lineup of the four teams in Group A tomorrow:</p>
<p>(Jingwu Association) Chen Ziming, Huang Fengjia, Tao Tingfu, Xu Guofu, Han Longgen, Shen Jind, Han Longhai, Li Yao, Luo Choufu, Chen Mingzhe, Zhao Yongfang, Lin Dianyi.</p>

<h3>Sports Anecdotes</h3>
<p>The tennis season has already begun, but the news in this city is still unknown. This is because this aristocratic sport is not easy to handle.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Cup basketball game is scheduled to open this weekend (9th) at Qingnian Middle School. The program is quite exciting. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion, which is also a stimulus to the long-standing basketball loneliness.</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, a new football player from Hong Kong, has arrived in Shanghai. According to him, he does not intend to join any football team for the time being and will take a break.</p>
<p>Zhang Lingen was appointed as the volunteer coach of the Jinlong Small Ball Team.</p>
<p>Miss Wang Weizhen of the Green Team works at the Asian Bank and has a team leader title. Therefore, the work is exceptionally heavy, but Miss Wang is still able to use her spare time to be active in the sports world, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Dai Linjing is accustomed to playing football on Xialing Road. Because he often went to Java (returning to his wife's hometown) before the war to practice in the hot summer. Therefore, Ah Dai's recent performances have been particularly good, not without reason. (Skinny reporter)</p>
<p>Zhou Wenji, the general manager of Mingxing Perfume Factory, enthusiastically advocates sports, organizes the Mingxing Basketball Team to participate in the league, and serves as the team leader. He is very interested in the game. It is heard that he will organize other iron teams (Ren).</p>
<h3>Simple Fitness Training Method (II) (X)</h3>
<p>- Written by Tom, translated by De</p>
<p>Gradually, the knuckles can touch the ground when the hands are clenched into fists, and finally the palms can also touch the ground. But it must be remembered that the knees must not be bent when the body is leaning forward.</p>
<p>If you have not practiced this exercise, it is enough to bend down and back five times each day in the first week. After that, increase five times each week until you bend down and back fifty times each day.</p>
<p>For many years, the author has practiced fifty times every morning, no matter what the environment is. Sometimes in a sleeping car, sometimes because he wants to catch a train, he practices at two or three o'clock in the morning. Sometimes on a ship when the sea is rough; sometimes in a retired room, even if the cold signature drops to minus sixteen degrees, he must practice fifty times, never interrupting or reducing it once.</p>
<p>Bend down and back　Bend forward, lean back, (five times each).</p>
<p>Note　Individual practice 50 times　　34. Bend left and right</p>
<p>Stand straight, the center of gravity is on both feet. Hands on the ribs. The left hand hangs down, and the body slowly bends to the left, and the left hand and right leg stretch as far as possible past the knee, but the right foot must not leave the ground.</p>
<p>Slowly raise the body and return to its original position. Put your left hand on your ribs, hang your right hand down, bend your body to the right, and stretch your right hand along your right leg as far as possible past your knee, but your left foot must not leave the ground. Body faces (waist muscle exercise) When driving forward, left and right, both feet must be firmly on the ground.</p>
<p>Bend　Left, Right, (five times each.)</p>
<p>Note　Because the action of bending forward and back is a complete exercise of the waist muscles, a special practice of bending left and right only needs ten times left and right.</p>
<p>35. Rotate Left and Right</p>
<p>Stand upright. Hands on the ribs. The body's center of gravity is on both feet. Turn the body as far as possible to the left without moving the feet. The head must maintain its relative position, that is, facing forward, so as not to turn before the body.</p>
<p>Turn the body as far as possible to the left, then slowly return to its original position, and then turn as far as possible to the right, with both feet firmly on the ground, do not turn with the body. Bend back</p>

<h3>The Battle for Bases on the Pacific Front</h3>
<p>Southwest Pacific</p>
<p>In any war, it is impossible to conduct operations without gaining control. This characteristic of warfare is particularly evident today. As seen in the battles in the Southwest Pacific, land and sea warfare seem to play little role. Instead, the fighting is primarily aerial, progressing from one small island to another as bases are advanced. It is difficult to seize even small, scattered islands in the vast ocean. Looking back at the enemy's counter-offensive operations in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea over the past two years, this becomes clear. Even with the expenditure of immense manpower and vast quantities of iron, the speed of recapture is as slow as a snail's pace.</p>
<p>New Guinea, the world's second-largest island, is mostly unexplored, with treacherous terrain, boundless forests, and wetlands, making land attacks impossible. In other words, the battleground is unique, with only thirty to forty scattered islands serving as bases for both sides.</p>
<p>Consumption and Replenishment</p>
<p>The main method of fighting for bases in the Southwest Pacific is an almost limitless war of attrition and replenishment. The absolute necessity of stable replenishment, and the strengthening of forces for a surprisingly powerful offensive, led the Japanese to temporarily shorten their lines. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Americans launched counter-offensives, relying on their inexhaustible production capacity to intensify the conflict.</p>
<p>The enemy's air force attacks use the Rotte tactic (single-column formation attack). If our planes engage the first aircraft, the second and third aircraft will follow closely without letting up. In aerial combat, one against three is more advantageous than two against six. If the Japanese can maintain this ratio against the Americans, they will surely achieve final victory.</p>
<p>On the other hand, no matter how superior the quality, without quantity, the chance of victory will vanish. The current approach in the entire Southwest Pacific is to rapidly replenish aircraft and pilots. Recently, the enemy has focused its main battlefield on the Central Pacific, pouring in large numbers of troops to strengthen its counter-offensive. At the same time, it is not relaxing its westward and northward advance from the Southwest Pacific. Currently, in Hollandia, New Guinea, a large enemy force has landed and is engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. Understanding this, one must not forget that the Southwest Pacific remains a major battlefield that will determine Japan's survival. (Translated from the May 31st edition of the Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>The enemy's attempt to lay hands on Japan's inner South Pacific sphere has been ongoing for some time. The previous invasion of the Marshall Islands was an initial manifestation of their ambition. This time, they boldly made a long-distance leap, launching a landing operation on Saipan Island, demonstrating an even greater ambition.</p>
<p>Earlier, on May 27th, the forces of MacArthur, commander of the enemy's Southwest Pacific Command, landed on Biak, and fierce fighting has continued for more than twenty days. The enemy's invasion of Biak Island is intended to use it as a springboard for invading the Philippines. At the same time, the enemy, ambitious to break through the Japanese defense line in the Central Pacific, has poured all its efforts into a bold landing on Saipan Island by Nimitz, commander of the Pacific Fleet. MacArthur and Nimitz are working together to launch a two-front war in the Pacific, revealing their ambition.</p>
<p>Saipan Island Defense Battle</p>
<p>The mobile units responsible for the landing on Saipan Island moved out from the sea east of the Mariana Islands. Since June 11th, they have repeatedly bombed the strong Japanese bases in Saipan, Tinian, Rota, and Guam. On the 13th, they dispatched fleets of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, approaching Saipan Island and bombarding the land with naval guns. Under the cover of this bombardment, enemy troops boarded powerful transport groups and attempted to land early on the 15th.</p>
<p>The Japanese garrison fought bravely, repelling the enemy twice at the water's edge. The enemy, coming for the third time, included a certain number of troops, and fierce fighting has continued on land for several days. The Japanese garrison launched a fierce counter-offensive. Meanwhile, powerful enemy mobile units remained in the vicinity of the island, fiercely bombarding Japanese positions day and night to facilitate the land battle, with shells raining down like a flood.</p>
<p>On the other hand, enemy detachments heavily bombed intermediate bases connecting the Mariana Islands with the mainland, such as Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima, on the 15th and 16th, to facilitate the Saipan Island battle. To counter this, Japanese air units attacked the enemy fleet on the night of the 11th, first sinking one enemy ship, followed by further attacks. At the same time, the Tinian battery destroyed one enemy battleship early on the 15th, posing a significant threat to the rear of the enemy landing force.</p>
<p>Significance of the Battle</p>
<p>The Saipan Island battle has three significant meanings:</p>
<p>First, Saipan Island is the core of the Pacific defense line, connecting the mainland to islands such as Truk and Palau, forming the core of Japan's strong inner South Pacific fortress line, namely the Mariana Islands.</p>
<p>Second, the enemy covets Saipan Island, intending to use it as an airbase for repeated bombing of the Japanese mainland with long-range bombers. Saipan Island is only about 2,200 kilometers from Japan. The enemy's B-29 Superfortress bombers can easily reach Northern Kyushu. This is why the enemy is so eager to acquire Saipan Island.</p>
<p>Third, the enemy has deployed a large mobile unit from the Nimitz fleet in a desperate attack to secure a strategic position.</p>
<p>Regarding the enemy's deployed fleet, which was previously described as an "unprecedented large formation" during the Marshall Islands invasion, it is imaginable that the current deployment of a large naval force is at least no worse than the previous mobile unit. The enemy's direct entry with a large fleet between the Japanese mainland and the inner South Pacific is tantamount to directly approaching Japanese waters. The enemy's only tactic is to advance the base air control zone, and under this air control zone, conduct landing operations, with aircraft carriers securing absolute air superiority and carrying out daring air battles. However, those who rely solely on quantity are bound to fail, and the enemy's mobile unit will eventually suffer significant losses.</p>
<p>Current Status of Enemy Fleet</p>
<p>The fleet under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, has suffered considerable damage since launching its counter-offensive in the Central Pacific, making the question of the U.S. fleet's strength worthy of attention. Reports from Admiral King or the Secretary of the Navy, recently, boast of how much the U.S. naval power has increased in the three years since the start of the war, showing a great deal of self-satisfaction.</p>
<p>It is said that the United States currently has 65 aircraft carriers, 20 battleships, 50 to 60 cruisers, 300 destroyers, and 165 submarines. According to recent foreign reports, when the land battle in Western Europe unfolded, the U.S. battleships "Arkansas," "Texas," and "Nevada" cooperated with British battleships to bombard and cover the landings. "Texas" and "Arkansas" were old battleships in the U.S. Atlantic Fleet before the war, indicating that the U.S. Navy has concentrated its main force in the Pacific, especially deploying a large portion of new ships in the Pacific as the focus of its counter-offensive.</p>
<p>The construction status of U.S. battleships since the start of the war is as follows: Four sister ships of the 35,000-ton "North Carolina" and "Washington," namely the "South Dakota," "Massachusetts," "Indiana," and "Alabama," and six 45,000-ton giant battleships, "Iowa" and "New Jersey," are said to have been launched and incorporated into the fleet.</p>
<p>Regarding aircraft carriers, 13 "Essex" class and control aircraft carriers, with a planned displacement of 7,000 to 25,000 tons, are being built, of which six have been commissioned. Nine small aircraft carriers converted from 10,000-ton cruisers have been launched, and about 50 specially equipped escort aircraft carriers converted from merchant ships have been built.</p>
<p>Under the command of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, Spruance is the commander for operations in the Central Pacific, Hurlburt is the commander of the Southeast Pacific Fleet, and Fletcher is the naval commander in the North Pacific waters. Halsey's South Pacific Fleet, which was dissolved at the end of March, has had its operational area incorporated into MacArthur's operational area, dividing the fleet strength between Nimitz and MacArthur equally. Halsey has been transferred to Nimitz as the commander of the Third Fleet. After the personnel adjustments in the Pacific Fleet, a portion of the mobile units was used to conduct westward operations in New Guinea, and a powerful mobile unit was dispatched to break into the inner South Pacific sphere, attempting to gain an advantage by sheer numbers, but ultimately suffering a major setback.

<h3>Chatting in German Trenches on the Caen Front</h3>
<p>Caen, an important town on the Normandy front in northern France, is currently the scene of fierce fighting. German troops are resisting bravely, vowing to coexist with their positions. German war correspondent Schumacher has recently sent a dispatch from the front line entitled "Conversations in the Trenches near Caen," vividly depicting the vigorous morale of the German troops at the front. What follows is the dispatch:</p>
<p>We dug a deep hole along a country road and slipped into it. This country road does not connect to streets or village roads, but it leads to the city of Caen. Beside me are two Panzergrenadiers, buried in the hole, setting up a machine gun, cutting grass, and piling it around the hole, just up to their chests. Half an hour ago, the four of us were still together, when suddenly a barrage of shells came flying here. One of them exploded beside us. A comrade shouted, "Damn it!" Extending his left thigh, his pants were torn, and blood was flowing. He went to the bandage station by himself to bandage it. Before leaving, I shook hands with him and said:</p>
<p>"Don't be discouraged, wait for me, I'll be right back..." He said, full of spirit, and left on his own.</p>
<p>We all wear helmets, not only to protect against shell fragments, but also because in the early summer countryside, flying insects are everywhere, and helmets can block small insects. The shells at this moment must have been fired from enemy warships, because there are small hills behind us, making it difficult to observe from here. The shells even drill straight into the ground, and our trenches are shaking, with mud clods jumping as high as the roof ridge. The shells must be of a large caliber. But we are still holding on to the trenches. We are ordered "not to let the enemy pass an inch, and to monitor them closely."</p>
<p>The enemy dispatched a tank unit to attack, but the enemy's tanks are no match for ours. Our famous Tiger tanks, with their shining armor, revolve their long barrels, and unleash a deafening roar upon seeing their prey. An ammunition carrier, who had previously been transporting bullets, brought a new belt of ammunition. Our bullets had already run out. As long as the grass in front moved slightly strangely, we would pull the trigger, so no matter how many bullets there were, it was not enough. A comrade shouted to the ammunition carrier:</p>
<p>"Hey! William, why are you limping like that!"</p>
<p>The ammunition carrier stood up, revealing an embarrassed look and said:</p>
<p>"Those Tommy bastards are always targeting my truck, ugh!"</p>
<p>He said, expressing his disgust.</p>
<p>The truck drivers never make mistakes. Their trucks are often discovered by enemy aircraft, and they have to hide in roadside holes to avoid being strafed by machine guns from low altitudes. But they are well aware of how eagerly the ammunition and gasoline they transport are awaited by the soldiers on the front line. They continue to advance day and night, crossing country roads scarred by shell bursts or French towns reduced to ruins.</p>
<p>The ammunition carrier, called William, continued from what he said earlier:</p>
<p>"After being bombed, I was reduced to rags. I happened to have a furlough, and when I returned to my hometown, my house was hit by enemy bombs. My hand became crippled, so now there is no trace of it. But that's all over. It's good that those bastards are back here now. The only thing I can't bear is that my wife's letter is gone. To prevent the truck from catching fire, I didn't have time to read it after receiving it and hurried to transport the ammunition boxes here."</p>
<p>"Ah--ha, what's that, what's moving over there?"</p>
<p>A comrade suddenly shouted, and five or six bullets flew from the muzzle, like a string of beads, towards the grass, but the grass had no reaction. It was probably the wind playing tricks.</p>
<p>"That little girl is already dead..." A comrade suddenly interjected. The conversations in the trenches are not organized; they are just fragments.</p>
<p>"What are you saying, that little girl?"</p>
<p>"That lost French girl, so pitiful."</p>
<p>"What is she doing staying on the battlefield at this time?"</p>
<p>"About an hour or two ago, there was a beautiful girl, sixteen years old, wandering around nearby, exhausted. She timidly asked me, 'Where am I going?' The French civilians all fled from the forest over there to the forest over here. She got separated in the middle, so she was crying. I said to her, 'Little girl, the German army has already warned the residents to evacuate the war zone immediately. Why didn't you escape earlier?' She replied, 'The British and American soldiers said they were coming to liberate us, so we thought it was better to stay at home.' Are the British and American soldiers really liberators? They only slaughter the innocent, liberators who tear families apart, destroying the little girl's family and home. The little girl probably didn't know yet. While she was still talking, an enemy fighter suddenly appeared at low altitude, bathed in machine gun fire. The little girl fell down and could no longer move..." (Translated from the June 19th edition of the Asahi Shimbun Berlin Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Northern France Battlefield</h3>
<p>Here are a few anecdotes I have gleaned from Berlin about the fierce battles in northern France, presented below:</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>...Reactionary war correspondents and German reporting teams are describing the fighting in Normandy as "hellish." From this, one can imagine how fierce the battle is. The scene of the Allied fleet and a large number of landing craft breaking through the densely laid minefields was already quite a sight. As for the Allied paratroopers, Marshal Rommel once said: "Under the surface of this flower garden, there are 80,000 landmines buried. Where are they? I'm afraid even the gods wouldn't know." Landing in this flower garden is no different from falling into the purgatory of hell. In reality, most of the Allied paratroopers went straight to paradise after jumping out of the plane.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>...In this landing operation, there have been no reports of the Allies using new weapons. Although they landed a large number of amphibious tanks near Harfleur, these are not new weapons. As for new tactics, they are nothing more than dropping life-size mannequins by parachute. The German side had already anticipated and prepared for such tactics. These fake paratroopers either explode upon landing or detonate when German soldiers approach. In short, they are both "disguise" weapons to confuse the German army and offensive weapons.</p>
<p>But according to a captured British pilot—who had flown a plane full of fake paratroopers—he recalled: "I flew with the fake paratroopers to the target area. When dropping the fake paratroopers, I had to first pull the fuse of the detonation device. While I was working, one of the fake paratroopers suddenly exploded, and the rest of them all caught fire. My plane also spewed out flames, and I had no choice but to quickly jump out with a parachute. I'm afraid there's nothing more terrifying than this."</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>...From the first day of the landing, many balloons rose into the sky over the English Channel, floating high in the clouds. These were released by the Allies to observe whether the shells hit the target and other situations. Around them, British and American fighters were constantly circling and soaring, guarding against attacks by German fighters. The Allies used all kinds of war tools to launch a desperate offensive. What is gratifying is that in this modern war, the German army has volunteer Cossack cavalry units. Riding on tall steeds, they gallop across the plains of Normandy, annihilating Allied paratroopers who have already landed, wielding their famous Cossack sabers, and displaying their ancient spirit of bravery.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>...During the landing operation, the German side was most worried that the military communication system would become ineffective under the heavy Allied bombing. In reality, although the Allied large bombs hit the fortresses along the Atlantic coast, the interior was not damaged at all. The entire communication system worked as usual, without any malfunctions. This shows that Germany's fortress construction technology is very excellent.

<h3>Small Kindness</h3>
<p>— Qinglu</p>
<p>The children's ward is filled with unfortunate children.</p>
<p>Rickets, pneumonia, bronchitis, empyema, typhoid fever, abscesses... Some have had their legs crushed by vehicles on the road, while others have been scalded by spilled kettles of boiling water in the alleys… The weak and mournful children are constantly being sent from every corner of the city to this ward.</p>
<p>However, their time in the ward is generally not very long. Except for those who arrive too late or are destined to die due to accidents, most of them leave the hospital, giggling and laughing, in just two or three months. Only Xiaohui on bed number four has been there for over a year.</p>
<p>Xiaohui was admitted last spring after his leg bone was broken by a cargo truck. He was truly in danger due to excessive blood loss. Fortunately, Dr. Liu's surgery was excellent, and he saved him from the brink of death. More than a month ago, his splint was removed, and he could walk freely like a normal child. This child is truly lucky.</p>
<p>When he first came to the hospital, he was accompanied by a father who looked like a worker, who prepaid two hundred yuan for medical expenses. After that, he never came to see his child. After three months, in order to collect the outstanding fees, the hospital repeatedly wrote letters and sent people to find his family. However, the address left by the family may not have been correct, so it was impossible to find them. When asked, Xiaohui only knew "Fourth Road" and that his father was called "Arong." He couldn't say anything else. He's just a six-year-old child!</p>
<p>Everyone guessed that no one would come to pick up the child, so he was allowed to stay.</p>
<p>The child is well-mannered and quite smart, but his past life on the streets has given him many bad habits. However, because of his misfortune, the nurses in each ward love him very much. They often talk to him, use scrap paper to teach him Chinese characters, and in two months, he has learned more than three hundred characters. He has also made significant progress in general knowledge.</p>
<p>Based on the child's incomplete conversations, it is known that Xiaohui must have come from a poor, often starving family of laborers. His father is a manual laborer without a fixed job who is also addicted to alcohol. The whole family lives in a whirlpool of misfortune.</p>
<p>Once I asked Xiaohui:</p>
<p>"What kind of business does your father do?"</p>
<p>"Dad goes out to do odd jobs for two days, and doesn't go out for two days."</p>
<p>"Does he like you?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't like me," the child said with a melancholy look in his eyes. "He drinks all day long and hits people, and wants to send me out to be a little beggar. Only on days when he doesn't drink does he take me to the road to play."</p>
<p>"What about Mom? She must like you."</p>
<p>"Mom is troubled. Dad asks her for money every day, and if she doesn't give it, he hits her. Mom didn't go to spin yarn when my little sister was born, and there was no money for Dad to drink, so he hit her again, and Mom cried."</p>
<p>Tears of sympathy filled the child's eyes, so I couldn't bear to ask any further.</p>
<p>After Xiaohui could walk freely, he no longer wanted to lie quietly in bed during the day. Even for a nap, he had to be coaxed and tricked into going to bed. Sometimes, if his little companions gave him a piece of biscuit or a candy, he would save it to coax other crying sick children. Sometimes he would hold a stack of Chinese characters on a small chair and read them earnestly, or he would teach other children. When the recovered children were discharged from the hospital, he would follow us to see them off, innocently saying polite things like "Goodbye! Come play again!" Some mothers who knew his background, seeing the child was clever, would often leave food and toys for him.</p>
<p>This was a good encouragement for Xiaohui, making him more willing to learn and be good.</p>
<p>Soon, a twelve-year-old boy with a broken left arm came to bed number eleven. He was probably the naughtiest of the sick children admitted in the past six months. He not only made a fuss, but also often quarreled with the children nearby, saying vulgar and obscene things. His mother was a woman who doted on her son. She brought dishes and snacks to her child every day, and sometimes even brought toys, which made the child seem very proud in the ward.</p>
<p>Which child doesn't have curiosity? The children's attention was focused on number eleven (we habitually called sick children by their assigned number). Xiaohui could not help but cast envious glances, or even walk over to touch his toy train and exchange a few words with him.</p>
<p>But number eleven became increasingly unruly. Sometimes he would generously give things to others, but then he would soon clamor to get them back. Sometimes, because he couldn't get back the candy or biscuits that other children had already eaten, he would make a big fuss and cry. One day, he even violently raised a pillow and threw a teacup at people, which caused us a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>So we secretly forbade other children to approach him. But with more than twenty children in a large room, it was sometimes really impossible to stop them. Moreover, curiosity is a child's nature, and they could not resist the lure of new toys, so they still went over, which only increased the arrogance of number eleven.</p>
<p>Sure enough, something worse happened.</p>
<p>That afternoon, number eleven's mother brought several more toys. Xiaohui watched from afar for a while, and finally went over to see what was happening. Who knew that number eleven would point at Xiaohui and say to his mother:</p>
<p>"Number four is a little refugee without parents or guardians. When he leaves the hospital, he can only be a little bum."</p>
<p>Xiaohui was so angry that his face turned green, and he raised his hand to hit him.</p>
<p>But he didn't hit him. His own hand was grabbed and bitten hard.</p>
<p>By the time we heard the crying and rushed over to pull them apart, Xiaohui's hand was already bleeding.</p>
<p>Afterwards, that woman even went to the director's office to complain, which caused us to be scolded.</p>
<p>From that day on, Xiaohui became dull. The lively smile disappeared from his round little face, and he always seemed to be thinking about something silently. No matter how we teased or coaxed him, we couldn't remove his indifference. His young soul had been deeply hurt. Even after the wound on his hand had healed, he could not regain his lovely innocence.</p>
<p>He was disgusted with this environment:</p>
<p>"Auntie (the children's general term for us), is my mom coming to take me back soon?"</p>
<p>In helpless embarrassment, I couldn't help but lie to him:</p>
<p>"Your mom is coming to pick you up in a couple of days. She's even buying you a foreign doll!"</p>
<p>I lovingly stroked the child's hair, sadly looking at his watery eyes.</p>
<p>The child was certainly not satisfied. Only other people's mothers came every day. In order to stubbornly think about his own mother, he became unwilling to recognize characters or eat. Giving him something only made him cry. He no longer taught the characters he had learned to others, and when mothers came to take recovered children out of the hospital, he no longer saw them off warmly, but only hid in the corner and stared blankly.</p>
<p>In the past half month, the child has become very haggard. Xiaohui's melancholy worries us. I thought, if I could find his family, let me send him back to his mother!</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, during my break, I secretly took Xiaohui to look for his home (this was against hospital rules). But after walking from Yuqiaqing Road all over "Fourth Road" to the Bund, the child couldn't point out where his home was, and we didn't run into his father "Arong."</p>
<p>On the way back, I bought the child a pair of gloves and two oranges. Xiaohui seemed a little happier, but as soon as we got back, he stuffed them under his pillow, because, unfortunately, another child was being discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>He hid in the corner again, staring blankly at other people's mothers.</p>
<p>The next day, the child suddenly fell ill, with a high fever, and he was delirious:</p>
<p>"Mom! Please come and take me back!"</p>
<p>"Dad, don't hit me, I won't do it again next time!"</p>
<p>The child's soul was disturbed by a major blow. I stood by the bed, watching with pity the motherless Xiaohui who was suffering in his dreams, and involuntarily kissed his forehead, which was burning with a high fever.</p>
<p>In this tragic world, Xiaohui brought me a heavy sense of the melancholy of the times.</p>
<h3>Go Learn to Hate</h3>
<p>— Jiangshui</p>
<p>I once saw with my own eyes</p>
<p>That rough giant palm</p>
<p>On your</p>
<p>Small face</p>
<p>Imprinted</p>
<p>Dark red marks;</p>
<p>I once heard with my own ears</p>
<p>The clapping</p>
<p>Wooden —</p>
<p>Impact of flesh against flesh!</p>
<p>I also saw</p>
<p>You, poor child!</p>
<p>Silently</p>
<p>Got up from the ground</p>
<p>Silently walked away.</p>
<p>Crying must have filled</p>
<p>Your small heart,</p>
<p>And people might say</p>
<p>This is retribution.</p>
<p>Who told you</p>
<p>To secretly touch things in someone else's basket?</p>
<p>Dad?</p>
<p>Mom?</p>
<p>Or someone else?</p>
<p>Eight years old, right? Child</p>
<p>Looking at you</p>
<p>You don't seem any older.</p>
<p>The tram is gone</p>
<p>Hitting you, who knows where you've gone</p>
<p>What are you still standing here for?</p>
<p>No one here will</p>
<p>Cast a sympathetic glance at you again.</p>
<p>Don't wipe away your tears</p>
<p>Don't curse</p>
<p>Go back! Child</p>
<p>— Go learn to be hated!</p>
<p>Hate those who hit you.</p>
<p>Go tell Dad</p>
<p>Go tell Mom</p>
<p>And tell others.</p>
<p>Let Dad curse violently</p>
<p>Let Mom secretly wipe away her tears</p>
<p>Child!</p>
<p>Go learn to hate!</p>
<p>Hate those who hit you</p>
<h3>Friendship</h3>
<p>— Keshi</p>
<p>If you want to gain friends, then you must be generous. A generous giver can often win people's hearts. (Marton)</p>
<p>The best way to gain a friend is to be a friend to people yourself. (Emerson)</p>
<p>Those who talk about using others everywhere cannot be friends, and those who do not connect utility with friendship cannot be friends. (Epicurus)</p>
<p>All the intimate consideration in friendship is far better than any large and expensive gift. (Goethe)</p>
<p>May your friendship be like a mouth and a hand. When the hand hurts, use the mouth to blow on it; when the mouth hurts, use the hand to stroke it. (Madagascar Proverb)</p>
<p>True friendship is like health. You only realize its value when you lose it. (Colton)</p>
<p>The friendship of gentlemen is as light as water, while the friendship of petty people is as sweet as honey. (Ancient Proverb)</p>
<p>Do not rely on gifts to gain a friend. You must offer your sincere love and learn how to win a person's heart in the right way. (Socrates)</p>
<h3>Troubles and Desires</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhou</p>
<p>For tens of thousands of years, the myriad of intelligent human beings have used their unique, world-surpassing intellect to gradually create a brilliant and dazzling new world for themselves—a modern society filled with extreme civilization and splendor.</p>
<p>But what great power drives them to complete this great task? It is the endless desires that never cease to grow from the sea of human desires! Countless people will answer wholeheartedly that this is the only reason. Because without desire, humanity would not progress! However, the most uncomfortable "troubles" ever felt by all of humanity (including wars and all man-made disasters, as well as all the unhappiness and misfortunes in the human world caused by human beings) arise from here! In other words, although they enjoy the blessings of civilization through their own efforts, they also suffer the pain of being entangled by an equal degree of troubles at the same time.</p>
<p>In order to satisfy their different desires, countless unavoidable conflicts of interest arise. These conflicts gradually escalate to white-hot heat, and finally they argue with each other, scold each other, and fight. As a result, both sides feel acute unhappiness because their beautiful ideals are unexpectedly hindered, and troubles arise in that instant. The above is the origin of troubles.</p>
<p>Based on the above theory, modern clear-headed philosophers have opened up a new "law."</p>
<p>The rise and fall of troubles and desires are directly proportional — the new "law" of temporary scholars.</p>
<p>If we annotate this new law with simple mathematical theory, we can get the following conclusion.</p>
<p>If desire can be made equal to zero, then trouble must also be equal to zero. The lower the desire, the more the trouble will definitely be reduced to the same degree. Conversely, the higher the desire of human beings, the troubles that occur afterwards will definitely not be exempted from increasing.</p>
<p>We people of the twentieth century live in this civilized world, and we enjoy enough of all kinds of blessings. However, the hateful troubles still come to his cruelty at any time and place, always hurting our innocent hearts, which is really unfortunate. In order to reduce unnecessary mental pain, we should definitely restrain our own unnecessary desires, so that we can offset the troubles that are about to occur to the highest level. When improper and excessive desires arise in our self-aware hearts, we can act decisively like this, because this often makes us become happy and self-controlled people!</p>
<p>Friends! Do you envy other people's suits and leather shoes? Do you envy other people's foreign buildings and mansions? Do you also envy other people's luxurious lives? In fact, they don't have anything overly noteworthy about them. Because of this, they are suffering from troubles that are no lighter than yours!</p>
<p>"Contentment brings happiness" should become a belief in our century-old lives!</p>

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Clarifies Determination to Strengthen Air Defense Violations of Air Defense Regulations Will Be Punished by Military Law</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of air defense training in Shanghai, the city's air defense situation has gradually improved, but it is still far from ideal. For example, during the training implemented on the 3rd of this month, there were still a considerable number of violators. At present, the war on the mainland is becoming more intense. In particular, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, since the recent Japanese army carried out a magnificent offensive operation, the forward bases have been destroyed one after another, so they have to avoid direct conflicts with the Japanese Air Force and are intent on engaging in air guerrilla tactics in order to disrupt the hearts of the people in peaceful areas. In view of this, the Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters has decided to greatly enhance the air defense posture of the city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Authorities' Remarks</p>
<p>Investigations have revealed that various air defense rules, especially light control, have been repeatedly announced and warned to call attention, but there are still a large number of people who are ignorant and unconcerned, especially during air raid warnings, there are still light leaks, and even direct rays of light are emitted outdoors, which is truly regrettable. This kind of behavior is actually hindering military operations, so from now on, in addition to continuing to impose power outages on those who violate the rules, they will also be severely punished in accordance with military law. All residents of the city, in addition to strictly complying with the regulations themselves, should also encourage each other and supervise each other in the neighborhood. All guidance agencies and self-defense corps members should also actively call attention, so that no one will be subjected to military law. This is greatly hoped for. A notice was issued on the 6th, and a statement was released clarifying the authorities' determination to strengthen air defense. From now on, anyone who violates air defense regulations will be severely punished in accordance with military law, especially those who violate light control, in addition to being subjected to power outages, will also be punished in the same way.</p>
<p>Important Notice</p>
<p>Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters Notice: For the purpose of announcement, it is now decided that anyone who violates various air defense rules in the future, especially those who leak lights during air raid warnings, will be punished for obstructing the military operations of the Great Japanese Army. In addition to stopping the power supply according to the notice of September 20, Showa 18, they will also be severely punished in accordance with military law. This notice is hereby issued for general information.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Industrial and Commercial Association Held a Symposium on the Current Situation: Minister Matsushima Elucidates the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>In order to allow the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to have a deeper understanding of the current situation, the Industrial and Commercial Association of this city held a tea party at the Hua懋 Hotel at 5:30 pm yesterday (the 6th), inviting leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to hold a symposium on the current situation and immediately asking Minister Matsushima, the reporting officer of the fleet, to explain the current situation of the Pacific War. In addition, this newspaper distributed a copy of the "New Situation Map of Greater East Asia" and a copy of "The Battle of the Mariana Islands" to the attendees. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tea Party Situation</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department arrived at the meeting on time with Captain Shiota. Leaders from the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial sectors included Tatsujiro Funatsu, Toraji Kurimoto, Hikoji Ichihashi, and Kenjo Kawaguchi from the Japanese side, and Wenlanting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Jiang Shangda, Xu Liqiu, Chen Shaoyan, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Pei Yunqing, Shen Siliang, Gu Nanqun, Wang Boyuan, Chen Riping, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Binhui, and Ren Yunpeng from the Chinese side. Miss Ri Koran (Li Xianglan), a star from Manchukuo Film Association, also attended. There were more than 200 people in total. After a speech by Chairman Wen Lanting, Minister Matsushima was invited to elaborate on the current situation of the Pacific War. Subsequently, various representatives raised several questions, which were answered by the Minister one by one. Then, current affairs films were shown: "The United Fleet in All Its Glory," "The Situation in Henan," and "The Battle of Rabaul on the Front Lines." Finally, Miss Ri Koran, a star from Manchukuo Film Association, sang two famous Chinese and Japanese songs. The event ended happily at 7:30 pm.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Wen Lanting said: "Although we in the industrial and commercial sectors often interact with each other in our businesses, we rarely have the opportunity to meet as a group. At the same time, although we are all busy handling our respective businesses all day long, we are also very concerned about the current tense situation. Today, we have specially invited Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department to report on the recent situation of the naval battle in the Mariana Islands, which I believe is most welcome to everyone."</p>
<p>Matsushima's Speech</p>
<p>"I am extremely grateful for everyone taking the time out of their busy schedules to attend today, despite the summer heat. The trends of the world war situation in both Europe and the Pacific are becoming increasingly clear. In the future war situation, the people of China and Japan must unite more closely to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>It is most necessary for the people of China and Japan to be familiar with the actual situation of the war and to understand where they should cooperate. The meaning of today's meeting lies in this.</p>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude to the Industrial and Commercial Association for their efforts in assisting with today's gathering.</p>
<p>Today is a symposium, and I hope that everyone present will freely exchange ideas in order to increase their understanding of the current situation.</p>
<p>First, there is a lot of counter-propaganda circulating regarding the war. The prevalence of this counter-propaganda is a characteristic of Shanghai, and it is also somewhat humorous. However, it has a very negative impact on the economy and on people's thinking, and may confuse the general public. Much of it is propaganda from the enemy, the United States, and at this critical moment, special attention should be paid to exposing this counter-propaganda.</p>
<p>Second, it seems that many people have been influenced by enemy propaganda. Enemy propaganda is very inaccurate, as can be seen from the damages they claim to have inflicted. But some people only listen to the enemy's propaganda and believe it to be true. In the future, if we have the opportunity, we hope to hold symposiums often so that everyone can understand the truth about the war.</p>
<p>Third, the current Pacific operations are closely related to the operations on the Chinese mainland, and both aim to destroy Britain and the United States. Especially regarding the operations on the mainland, as stated in the recent statement by the Japanese government, there is no war behavior whatsoever against the Chinese people. We understand very well that it is foolish for the East Asian peoples to continue to fight each other for so long. I believe the Chongqing authorities also know this. What we should pay attention to is that Britain and the United States are taking advantage of this opportunity to reap the benefits.</p>
<p>Fourth, the current war in the Pacific is increasingly becoming a general counter-offensive posture by the enemy, and the fighting is extremely fierce. In order to achieve final victory, we are using various means to destroy the enemy's war power. The results achieved in Saipan are extremely significant. More than half of the aircraft carriers have been sunk or destroyed. The brave fighting of the frontline soldiers has greatly troubled the enemy, and the objective has been fully achieved in terms of naval strategy. U.S. Undersecretary of the Navy Forrestal told newly appointed reporters on the 5th that the losses in Saipan were unexpected, which is clear proof of this. The enemy's operational goal is to gain a foothold on the Chinese mainland and make a final decisive battle. In order to fulfill our mission of protecting East Asia, we will not hesitate to fight to the end. Please identify the enemy's counter-propaganda and do your best to assist in solidifying the belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Answering Questions</p>
<p>Subsequently, Minister Matsushima answered the questions raised by the attendees one by one as follows:</p>
<p>Question: If Saipan cannot be defended, what will be the prospects for the war?</p>
<p>Answer: The Japanese military's strategy on Saipan is to lure the enemy deep and annihilate them. Even if Saipan falls, it will not have a significant impact on the mainland war. Furthermore, Saipan is a very small island and does not have a naval base. As long as the Japanese military prevents the enemy's air base on Saipan from being used and does its best to destroy it, the objective will have been achieved. Moreover, the Japanese military has bases in New Guinea, the Philippines, and other places, so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Question: After gaining a foothold, will the enemy be able to continue to advance?</p>
<p>Answer: The enemy intends to use Saipan as a base for its air raids against Japan, but the Japanese military has done its best to destroy it to prevent it from succeeding. Saipan is only 24 li long and 12 li wide. Even if the enemy uses it completely, its scope will be very narrow and not as important as the Chinese mainland. At the same time, the naval fleet is operating with extreme caution to prevent the enemy's British fleet from a second front, and therefore is being particularly vigilant. The enemy has widely publicized that the Japanese navy has been defeated. Whether this is reliable will soon be proven by the facts.</p>
<p>Question: What is the importance of the Mariana Islands in the Greater East Asia War?</p>
<p>Answer: There are many small islands in that sea area, and the Japanese military had long anticipated that the enemy would launch a full-scale attack. We made thorough preparations and, upon the enemy's arrival, launched a devastating blow. Currently, there are not many enemy forces in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands, only a few aircraft carriers and cruisers protecting the aircraft carriers, and no regular fleet.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the enemy attacked Iwo Jima and the Ogasawara Islands with a part of their mobile force. However, the headquarters announced at 17:30 today: The enemy mobile force that launched this attack has been repelled by the Japanese military and fled on the afternoon of the 4th. In this battle, more than 74 enemy aircraft and 5 ships were shot down, and we lost 30 aircraft.</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese navy's tactics, its strategy is to lure the enemy to the vicinity of the mainland and destroy them. This is the most ingenious tactic. Whether the enemy attacks the Ogasawara Islands or Iwo Jima, there is nothing to fear.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the fundamental principles of naval warfare. Regardless of the method of operation, there are only two principles: what Sun Tzu's Art of War calls "preemptive strike" and "concentration." Preemptive strike means striking first, and concentration means concentrating all forces. Before the start of the war, the Japanese military occupied almost all the islands in the entire sea area, with the aim of expelling the enemy from the Greater East Asia region, securing resources in the south, and establishing contact with the Chinese mainland to enhance Japan's war power. What is the current objective? It is to wait for the enemy to come and destroy them. Strategically speaking, this is the only option.</p>
<p>The Japanese military's forward bases in the South Pacific knew that the enemy would definitely launch a counterattack, so they prepared early, waited for the opportunity to defeat the enemy, and then lured the enemy deeper to annihilate them in one fell swoop. Therefore, the Japanese military is not only not worried about the enemy approaching the Japanese mainland, but welcomes it. For example, the sinking of two aircraft carriers (over 27,000 tons) and two cruisers near Iwo Jima last time was the result of using this ingenious tactic.</p>
<p>What Japan is most concerned about now is the enemy's attempt to use the Chinese mainland. Japan will not allow the enemy to land on Chinese soil under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Question: What is the situation in the Ogasawara Islands?</p>
<p>Answer: The Ogasawara Islands are the Japanese military's air base and defense base. If the enemy attacks, they will be severely attacked by the Japanese military. Because the flight time from the islands to Japan is only one hour, there is nothing to fear even if the enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Answer: In the future, the enemy will definitely do everything possible to seize Saipan. If Saipan falls, they will then attempt to invade the Japanese mainland, the Chinese mainland, or the Philippines. However, the enemy's supply lines will be extended accordingly, which is extremely beneficial to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Indian Residents in Shanghai Hold a Celebration Meeting: Anniversary of the Establishment of the Independence League</h3>
<p>This month, the 4th to the 10th is "Leader's Week," the anniversary of the establishment of the Indian Independence League. Yesterday (the 6th) was the third day of the week. More than 2,000 Indian residents in Shanghai gathered at the Indian National Army training camp on Doushan Road at 1:30 pm. At 2:00 pm, they set off on a parade, passing through Beisichuan Road from Doushan Road, crossing the Baidu Bridge, and converging at the end of the bridge. The First Police Bureau band led the way, to the Bund, turned into Nanjing Road, and entered the racecourse from Jing'an Temple Road. The mood was enthusiastic. The celebration meeting began at 4:00 pm, with formal ceremonies. A minute of silence was observed to commemorate comrades who sacrificed for Indian independence. Then, speeches began. First, the chairman of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, Mr. Chot, delivered a speech, saying that in the past year, the Indian residents in Shanghai have done their best, but now is a time of life and death. He said that they would rather die than be unfree, and hoped that all residents would do their best. Next, Captain Bonglund, the commander of the Indian National Army training camp in this city, delivered a speech with much encouragement, reiterating that the Indian National Army was fighting to liberate India's independence and freedom from the hands of British and American aggressors, and would rather die in battle. In order to obtain freedom, it is necessary to destroy British and American imperialism. Then, Lieutenant Shu Xin of the Indian National Army said that no matter what difficulties or obstacles, the Indian army would fight hard to defeat the evil forces of Britain and the United States, and march straight to Delhi to achieve final victory. Finally, Mr. Gao Li, the propaganda minister of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, delivered a speech with many pertinent and important points, strongly stating that in the past year, under the leadership of leader Jiang Tela Bose, we have made more progress than we expected. We will repay the false propaganda of Britain and the United States with facts. The Indian army has crossed the Indo-Burmese border to attack the enemy. Today, we have stepped into Indian territory. The bravery and strength of the Indian National Army have made Britain and the United States fear and rush to release Gandhi. If we launch a further attack on the remaining enemies, there will be even greater losses. Defeating Britain and the United States is the only way to achieve Indian independence and freedom. Our tricolor flag has been flying high in our homeland, marching straight towards Delhi. Finally, accountant Ha Nanxin gave a speech, urging Indian residents to donate generously to the Indian National Army. In an instant, enthusiastic Indian residents donated enthusiastically, exceeding 300,000 yuan, which, combined with the previous monthly donation of more than 50,000 yuan, has exceeded 4 million yuan. Other Indian representatives also gave speeches one after another. Until 6:00 pm, everyone stood up and shouted "Revolution Wan Ji," "Long Live Free India," and "Long Live the Leader."</p>
