<h3 id="c1">政權與治權 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>孫中山先生在政治學上最大的貢獻，就是把「權」和「能」分淸。「權」是「政權」，「能」是「治權」。政權屬於人民，治權屬於政府。治權猶如一個機器的發動部份，政權猶如這個機器的制止關鍵。政權和治權劃分的理論基礎，在乎「民本」立塲，亦卽中國儒家所謂「民為貴」的一貫思想。</p>
<p>自從民國十六年發動國民革命之後，國民政府的治權就遵照中山先生的遺敎成立，而中國國民的政權，因為軍政方才結束，訓政剛剛開始，所以遲遲不能實現。從民國十六年到二十六年的十年間，可說是「只有治權，沒有政權」的時期。在這時期裹，中國政治上社會上都經過了許多變化，犧牲了許多人民的生命，摧毀了無數國家的元氣。其結果在政府方面講，事事不能實行；在國民方面講，事事不合民意。因此我們敢說：國民沒有政權，政府也就沒有治權，政府若要有强固的治權，先得使人民有强同的政權。</p>
<p>民國二十九年國民政府還都以後，除了產生國民政府的中央政治委員會，雖然以國民黨為主體而延攬其他各黨各派或無黨無派的份子外，其餘的政府組織，仍舊照還都以前的規制。國民的政權當然也談不到。同時，無可諱言的，四年來國民政府事實上的政績還距離人民的希望很遠，政策的推行，還不能够做到喚起民衆的地步。癥結所在，不必細述。囚此我們又敢說，治權的基礎在乎政權，先有强有力的國民，然後才可產生强有力的政府。</p>
<p>現在是大束亞戰爭時期，更是决戰的關頭，我們不願意高談政治理論，而只希望政府與人民打成一片，作為取得最後勝利的保證。針　這個現實，我們提出一個單純的原則，希望此後中國有一個强有力的政府，可是，必須先得加强人民的力量。惟有建設民意機關，惟有准許人民參政，才可以加强人民力量，然後可以建成强有力的政府。</p>
<p>一般的說，常政者每懼人民有了力量，將對自己地位或有不利。這種覜念，足為政府與人民打成一片的隙礙，足為建立强力政府的障礙，而妨害國家的大局。特別是民意機關的建立，在人民一方面講，是行使政權的初步。在政府一方面講，是政府的耳目，更是政府治權的擁護者。無論在主觀客觀上，都有絕對的需要。人民有了表現民意的機會，民意有了制裁的力量，於是人民對於政府所施行的一切符合民意的政策，自然會竭誠擁護，使政府有完全的職權。我們希望國家給人民政權，人民自必給政府以治權。惟有以全民為後盾的政府是强有力的政府，惟有上下一心，和衷共濟的國家方才能够在大時代裏獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c2">第二戰綫問題與　英美蘇的關係 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>最近的外電，傳來了種種關於西歐第二戰綫的時期之種種傳說。其來源以美國方面為主，這與向來强硬要求實施第二戰錢的蘇聯之緘口無言，兩相比較起來，眞是奇妙的對照。在德黑蘭會談上發人，關於西歐第二戰綫的時期與規模，英美蘇的意見已吿一致。所以蘇聯的守緘默，可以解釋為信賴這會談的約言。從去歲耶誕節前後開始的冬季攻勢，新年以來，日見激烈，依常識論，第二戰綫當然呼應蘇聯的冬季攻勢而實施。然在英美方面，最近才完畢了任命艾森霍華以下反軸心侵歐軍首腦部的人選，從船隻的活動，英本國的陸運狀况看來，芷在集結大量軍隊以備登陸，但在蘇聯的冬季攻勢吿終之前，是否能展開與此呼應的大規模的第二戰綫，似乎還是個疑問。</p>
<p>從英美的立塲說來，就德蘇開戰以來儘量利用蘇聯戰力的根本方針而言；就利用最小犧牲企獲最大效果而言；此次的冬季攻勢，當然讓蘇聯儘量在東部戰綫消耗德國的戰力，希望削弱對英美登陸戰的抵抗力。但在這展延第二戰綫的時期中，蘇軍已到達了舊德蘇國境綫。關於蘇聯的軍事行動，各方面都認為沒有再行西進的必要。如果這樣，則此後英美蘇三國的關係，究竟能够毫無障碍，繼續圓滿的協調嗎？</p>
<p>冬季攻勢狀况</p>
<p>再看最近冬季作戰的進行狀况，蘇聯不問英美第二戰機的實施情形如何，為了追求自己的戰爭目的，而進行自己的戰事。常然，在德黑　會談以後的新情勢上，門於遂行對德戰這共同目的，英美蘇之間不會發生這樣簡單的各自為謀；蘇聯的冬季攻勢和英美實施第二戰綫時期之間，也不會沒有十分的諒解。但假定蘇聯在比次的冬季攻勞中恢復了舊德蘇國境，則蘇聯的戰爭目的暫吿完成，此外所剩的尚有巴爾幹問題等。返顧國內，則尚有因過去三年來的戰禍所造成的廣大荒地與恢復疲弊國力等重要間題。</p>
<p>蘇聯在此次的冬季攻勢中，如其到春天旣不能恢復舊德蘇國境錢，又不能實施第二戰綫，則蘇聯要在五月中旬以後開始的夏季作戰中，傾注應大的戰鬭力，或許是相當困難的。</p>
<p>而英美方面，從各種意義上看來，五月以後，是展開第二戰綫的好機會。到那時候，陸海空的侵攻準備，在兵力上，在作戰上，將充分整備就緒，西歐的氣候條件亦有利於大規模戰　的展開。但難題祗在於東西同時進攻的時候，東方的蘇聯攻擊力，能够期待到何種程度。</p>
<p>英美企圖遲延</p>
<p>以上關於第二戰綫與蘇聯冬季攻戰的想法，英美方面以為如果與蘇聯的政治關係所許，則似乎希望把西歐第二戰綫展延到五月左右。到那時候，蘇聯冬季攻勢的結果已經瞭然，一面等待德國國力的消耗，他們的標語一穩蓄穩打」的登陸戰之準備亦將就緒。英國軍事評論家李德爾，赫德等的議論，就是反映這種思想。但德黑　會談中史·羅·邱三巨頭所决定的「第二戰錢之時期」，恐怕不這樣遲吧！大約是早則二月，至遲三月。那麼蘇聯究竟是否知道延期到晚春初夏的時候呢？李德爾·赫　的論說，和星期泰晤士報的一文，就是對蘇聯的試探。</p>
<p>如果在與蘇聯的關係上，不容如此遷延，而必須迅即展開第二戰綫，那正產生了德國所說的成為擊減英美之絕好機會的可能性。英國也知道得很淸楚，所以關於開關第二戰綫，時期縱遲，亦希望整務妥當後方才實施。在此以前，大約將對被視為登陸地點的荷蘭，比利時，法國等沿岸將大肆轟炸。那大轟炸局部的已經開始，但尚未能視為登陸作戰前的眞正大轟炸。</p>
<p>德國的决心</p>
<p>希特勒在新年佈告中說：一國民諸君，余以百分之百的確信，　必粉碎登陸敵軍。」一月七日，德軍當局詳細發表從北歐的挪威到比利斯山脈的歐洲大陸西海岸數千公州的防備狀况。這表示英美的登陸企圖，無論在何時何地，德國的對策已經準備了。</p>
<p>第二戰綫的時期，愈趨迫切，近來在英國方而這问題成為再檢討的對象。這在政治上，戰略上，都是極可注目的。第二戰綫在目前　供了種種話題。不過以為英美因此而怕實施第二戰綫的困難。那就錯了。他們確官覺悟了一切犧牲，必欲付之實施的。（翔：譯自一月十六日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c5">希特勒演詞 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>柏林三十日中央社電　德元首希特勒於國社黨秉政第十一週年紀念日，向德國人民廣播，演辭如：「在此歷史上最大戰爭之第五年，無人能懷疑於此次世界大戰之原因或目標，此次戰爭由英國所發動，其目的在於維持有利於英帝國之歐洲均勢，當時以為此種戰爭僅屬歐洲之衝突者，其時代已成過去。此次</p>
<p>戰爭結局</p>
<p>不論如何，以前為英國所利用之份子，現已各自為主，無論此次戰爭如何，英國對大陸之統治，確已成為過去。今日之問題，已非此次戰爭結束後歐洲之舊均勢是否將恢復，今日之間題，為此次戰爭結束後，誰將在歐洲佔絕對之優勢。此若非由最强大之國家所代表之歐洲各民族，即為布爾雪維克巨像。若干英國報紙所稱：蘇聯於征服德國後，將無復在歐洲繼續挺進之理由一節，無非一種猶太詭計，其用意在於欺騙歐洲之愚人而已，若以為英國甚至在戰爭尚未完全結束之前，將領導對蘇之新戰爭者，亦屬欺人之談。第一，在此民族戰爭中之勝利者，其戰爭之目標决不願受英國報人之指定。第二，歐洲各可憐之殘餘國家，恐不願在英國領導之下與蘇聯作戰，蓋因此種作戰之軍事前途，惟十足之愚人方認為具有希望，故有一事可十分確定者，即此次戰爭中僅有</p>
<p>一個勝利</p>
<p>者，而此勝利者非德國即蘇聯。德國之勝利，即為歐洲之保全，而同時蘇聯之勝利，則將為歐洲之毀滅，此種事實，甚為明顯，甚至稍有常識之英國人，亦當明瞭之。英人若果一秉其與型之虛偽而假作，事情或不致如此，是乃因倫敦之一班戰爭罪犯無法自解之故，但其後路，在內政方面亦已為猶太索綫人所阻塞，故英·美今日所遭遇之問題，已非復此次戰爭結東後，本身是否將對布爾雪維克主義作戰。而為彼等是否能在本國抵抗布爾雪維克主義。歐洲實際所期望於英國之諾言，已由英·美對波蘭·芬蘭波羅的國家以及整個東南歐之態度作最佳之說明，此等國家皆為英國所犧牲，此固非由於倫敦普通人所欲如此，但因萬一布爾雪維克主義獲得勝利，英國無法阻止一切發展，故</p>
<p>挽救歐洲</p>
<p>各國家與整個歐洲之問題，完全繫於國社主義之德國人民，德國武裝軍與德國之同盟國家。德國若果不幸而崩潰，則歐洲別無第二個國家能予布爾雪維克之侵犯以有效之抵抗，克林姆深知此點，故布爾雪維克萬一勝利，蘇聯將處德國於萬劫不復之地位，此次戰爭若果失敗，則北歐與東南歐各國之命運，將於數月內决定，西歐亦將於短時期內接踵而減亡。十年之後，此最古之文化大陸，將失去以前生命之一切特點，德國人民今日所以能為德國與全歐大陸之命運而進行戰爭者，皆賴上帝之恩典，蓋上帝於十一年之前，使國社黨經長期之奮鬥後，得能秉政。當時若無一九三三年一月三十日與國社黨之革命，則歐洲今日即無一强國能予布爾雪維克巨像以有效之抵抗</p>
<p>德國以前</p>
<p>因受猶太人之影響，甚至在德國邊界內，亦　乎無法控制布爾雪維克之威脋，更無論對德國以外之布爾雪維克人作戰。當時德國國內之布爾雪維克革命，結果雖未完全成功，但民主主義惠瑪立憲之德國，已無法對付近代世界政治之偉大工作，為準備未來之戰鬥起見，故必須解決不但在軍事方面，而且在社會經濟方面之一切工作。國社黨於十一年之前立即以實現國社主義之計劃為開端，而最後終於建立一國家，無論在內政與軍事方面，均能不辱其對歐洲之使命。一九三三年國社黨面對四大任務，此</p>
<p>四大任務</p>
<p>之解決，不但有關德國之前途與歐洲之拯救，甚至全人類之文明，恐亦有賴於此。此四大任務即第一，為解决社會問題，以恢復德國內部之社會和平，第二，除德國人民之社會政治聯合外，復加以國家政治之聯合。換言之，即當時政治上四分五裂之德國，須以統一之國社主義國家代替之，第三，該國族主義之國家，須立即成立武裝軍，在精神上，道德上，人類上與國備上，均能作為自存之工具，第四，為保衛歐洲起見，必須合併四德國人所居之國家或千年來向屬於德國之國家，十一年當國社主義運動經長久之奮鬥後，在國內秉政之時，解决此項任務之先决條件，已經成立，德國人民均在黨內團結一體，故第二年政府之成立，並非由於國家而由於國社主義運動，德國之發動與實行國社主義革命，將被稱為歷史上最偉大事蹟之一。此次戰爭之結局，將見德國與歐洲之勝利，此在每一國社主義者看來，僅為其信念之表現，今日不但前綫之兵士，而且後方之戰士均為勝利之保障者。敵人企圖以炸彈使德人崩潰，結果徒加强國社主義之人民與國家之國結而已，我人</p>
<p>忠於信念</p>
<p>勇往直前，撥雲霧面見靑天之日為期不遠，今日憂慮愈大者，萬能者，將衡其工作而賜以愈重之報酬，故敵人雖野蠻如魔，而戰爭之結果，勝利將屬諸德國也。</p>

<p>從勃海南下，稱爲黃海，東海的茫茫千涇的海域，海水中溶挾大陸的泥沙，渾濁黃褐，洶洶澎湃地沖洗大陸沿岸。它和蔚藍的南太平洋——日美海軍的决戰塲——連接、祗有顏色不同，洵爲大東亞戰爭的重要戰塲。日木海軍的封鎖艦艇，不分畫夜，在那裹活躍，防止企圖搗亂連結日本本土和兵站基地中國大陸的海上運轍綫的敵方潛水艇的蠢動，並由監視艇嚴密警戒，防範偷越封鎖網以圓連絡重慶路綫的走私海船的跳梁。在南方驚人的戰果之下，毛細管般分佈於中國東海全區的哨戒艦艇的辛動努力，也是值得銘感的。不單日本本土和中國大陸間的運輸綫。就是南方和日本間的航海綫，也是依仗這些艦艇來保護的。再則，在此海域活躍的日本海軍艦艇，並且究成了掃海艇的任務，取除浮動水雷和磁性水雷；這也是值得報告的。</p>
<p>再會吧上海</p>
<p>「火速於〇時前集合！」從中國方面艦隊報道部接到這個命令時，正是屠蘇酒氣息尚未褪盡的一月三日。去歲以來，我就抱着一個願望，打算由我們這批報道班員的禿筆，將日本益視隊在中國大陸沿岸的東海上活躍的勞苦情形，轉吿後方。不料這個機會　突然來了。慌忙取出攝影機，拿在手中，一面嚴肅反省到已故山本元帥的「常在戰塲」的銘言，於寒風拂面中，跑到江畔。旗艦出雲艦的桅榫上，今日也揭起了軍艦旗和長官旗。搭載記者到司令官所乘的〇〇砲艦去的〇〇丸，敏捷穿過蝎集的大帆船羣開始，向黃浦江下游航行時，恰巧是正午·艇長指着左右帆船上面飄揚的靑天白日旗，感慨地說道：「大東亞戰爭以前，都是掛英國旗的！這一·二年來，什麽都變了。！」回顧外灘，康梯凡第號的殘骸，已在視野之外。記者所乘的艇，速度很快。走出艦橋一望，桅桿上懸着一枝松，艇長室內也陳列着大大小小的供餅，令人深深感到戰時海軍的風雅。</p>
<p>駛下黃濁狹隘的水路，共費數小時。不知不覺間，艇已駛抵長江的本流，向江口西進。航過崇明島，將出大海時，監視員告訴我道：「宮野先生，前方望見船團呢。「我張大兩眼，拼命朝前而眺望，可是什麽也沒有看見。</p>
<p>「請用這個東西望。」監視員笑道，將他的雙眼望遠鏡借給我。</p>
<p>果然看到了。有六隻船，正吐出濛濛的黑烟，向這方前進。</p>
<p>「旁邊還有一隻大型航海帆船哩！」監視員從旁指點我。</p>
<p>果眞，用借來的望遠鏡仔細一看，在六隻船的左方，的確看到小的黑點。雖然時近黃昏，海上的視界頗狹，他竟能夠用肉眼正確而又敏捷地辨別遠方的東西，這種銳利的眼力，不得不呌人佩服！</p>
<p>「怎樣能夠看得如此淸她？」記者不覺問道。</p>
<p>「訓練成功的呀。」他的回答雖然簡單，但有如此銳利的目力，在不中用的人已儘夠嚇出一身冷汗了。</p>
<p>「請望左方，那而有中國海軍的練習艦。」</p>
<p>我依照也所說的故，果然有　着三根桅桿的黑影映入我的眼簾。</p>
<p>隔了一小時光景，我們和船團相錯而過</p>
<p>「辛苦了！」不覺高聲喊出了這句話。</p>
<p>船團完成了大任務，緩緩航行。</p>
<p>海上之夜</p>
<p>搭載我們的艇暫泊此處。莊重的喇叭聲消失在中國東海的暮色裏時，軍艦旗從桅頂慢慢降下。我被船的搖幌擺動許久，肚子早已感到空虛，所以吃晚餐時，滋味特別好。食後，和艇長·輸機長斟酒歡談。對於內地後方的姿態和新中國狀况的種種熱心的質問，記者就自己所知的範圍答覆。</p>
<p>「啊，得　高論，眞正愉快！務必請你講給士兵無褲日　啊！對不起，對不起！」對於我的毫無可鄧的話，傾聽之餘，實在使我非常過意不去。</p>
<p>後來，談鋒漸漸轉向大東亞戰爭勃發時的事情。艇長微微睜眼，追懷往事道：</p>
<p>「潛水艇在馬來洋面發見那艘威爾斯親王號時，我恰巧也在潛水艇的編隊中。——那是風雨蕭萧的日子喲。」</p>
<p>據說艇上的人員有許多是轉戰南方的海上的健者。</p>
<p>「那末，現在幹這種無聲無臭的工作，大家都有希望早些到活躍的南方去的心理吧？」</p>
<p>對於記者的這個質問，答案是：</p>
<p>「不，沒有這樣的事。士兵們依據自己過去的經騐，早已明白這種工作對於第一綫上作戰的兵土們及內地的擴充生產力是很要緊的，所以特別安然處之。况且，我們雖然在這裏，但是一旦命令下來，便會上前綫去的。士兵們並不像你所想那樣喜歡幹出風的事呢。」</p>
<p>聽到這個答時，記者眞有點兒慚愧到　頭也抬不起來了。在後方，目前是在强調着所謂「滅私奉公」這個口號，而這裏的人則在平淡的心境中，成爲無我獻身的，近乎神的存在，不斷地實踐「滅私奉公」。記者雖然在艇上祇參觀了一天，也已感到是相當繁重的任務，但他們却天天反復這種日課。因此，聽到那種淡然不以為奇的話語，日本海軍轟轟烈烈的鬥志和訓練，不覺深深銘刻我的胸中。</p>
<p>十一點鐘相近，突然起風，天空黑　密佈，終於降起雨來，海上俄然風狂浪湧。這樣一來，艇長忽然笑着說：</p>
<p>「你們可以早些到那艘砲艦上去了，因爲巳經變更預定，今晚就要出航了。</p>
<p>傾耳一聽，風似乎已成狂飆，彷彿遠遠傳來的什麼莊嚴的重濁的歡聲，在海上奔馳。</p>
<p>「唔，半夜裏，在這樣的大氣中？」記者們可有些慌張了。</p>
<p>「這就軍人講、是很好的。夜中出航的事我已幹了多次啦。此船到上海迎接報道班員時，也　在夜裏出發的。担任夜間警戒後，兵士的眼睛也看得更淸楚了。」</p>
<p>「我們必須有猫的眼睛。猫眼是適於黑夜。」最後，艇長反復重述這兩句話。</p>
<p>「全體就位！」命令一下，艇錨便舉離海面，在漆黑的，風雨飄搖的海上，向西南駛去。</p>
<p>「担任海上哨戒的任務者，比敵方早發見目的物，乃是决定的要素。幸而我們日本人的眼睛，不論在天賦上或訓練上，都勝過洋鬼子，所以會有那樣的戰果。」這是剛才輸機長告別時所說的話。</p>
<p>「眞這樣嗎？」我回想着輪機長的話，將身躺在搖幌的床上，不知不覺地快要睡熟時，不料矇朧的睡眼突然望見前面的艇長睏的床上是空的。再睜開眼細看時，被單毫無皺痕，被服仍像最初一樣揩疊着。</p>
<p>一啊！艇長昨夜起整晚沒有睡呢，徹宵在指揮着艇的行動呢！</p>
<p>因暈船而疲倦的身體和睡眼惺忪的頭腦，被雪白的沒有一絲皺痕的被單引起眼睛的注意，着起外套，走至操舵室那裹去看時：</p>
<p>「在那裹」！</p>
<p>先前輕快地與記者談笑的艇長，凝視着前面祇有一米遠白光的黑暗的海面，像不動的快　像般，貼在窗上張望着。一身負起夜間哨戒與艇的責任，目不轉睛地，立在艇的最前端。深深的感動，使記者全身被感激的汗所濡濕了。出神地對之眺望了數分鐘。</p>
<p>直到明天早晨，艇長終於沒有回到床上。朝　也沒有用。</p>
<p>到大亮時，到達了砲艦的椗泊地。無數的海鷗，露出他們的白腹，在艇的前後飛着，風勢依然未會減弱，雨似乎快要下來了。艇的舷側一只海鷗飛去了，看到目的物砲艦時艇長方才回過頭來，露出了二只白齒，向　者說話了。</p>
<p>在砲艦半日</p>
<p>「司令所乘的　艦○○號，目前正負起〇〇的任務去了，所以請在先前的〇〇砲艦等一下，自己的艇，因爲〇〇的緣故，請你們報道班員移到那裹，立即出發。」</p>
<p>不久，〇艇迎前來了。在船頭立着的十七八歲的少年，大約是富志願軍屬的。同報紙，雜　，街頭絕緣的，在這茫茫的海洋的一角，挺身國難立在確保　　路的第一綫勞動的少年勇士。不過相　了盡夜的短時間，就別離了，多少感到一點寂寞。〇〇名船員，完全立在舷側，向我們二個報道班員揮着帽。對於這海的勇十，以常前的有力者自任的海的勇士們之樸實的友情，胸中沒有不感熱情的人吧！和他們約再會而分別了。</p>
<p>「此次再會時，不是在拉巴爾便在科倫坡。」</p>
<p>精神振作地和〇艇的蒸氣一同移到砲艦上。</p>
<p>這艦長是越中島出身，所以是銳氣積溢的大尉。把昭和十九年度的日曆和雜誌呈獻給他時，如孩子們一樣的欣喜，他是大東亞戰爭勃發後進擊馬來半島的勇士，婆羅門登陸的勇士，完成每次護送船團的任務，直到去年五月，到達昭南的塞來德軍港的身經白戰的勇士。</p>
<p>「怎樣，近來遇到美國的艦隊嗎？」</p>
<p>記者問着。</p>
<p>「到現在爲止，我不記得受了幾十枚魚雷了。近來差不多沒有來，也不會來。」</p>
<p>他豪快地笑答着。</p>
<p>「內地近况如何？」</p>
<p>「不知道，祗有去年歸去過一次。」</p>
<p>「是奉命休假嗎？」</p>
<p>「是療養所。恰因爲那時候受了傷。」</p>
<p>在隨便的談話中，武人的面目躍然如見。</p>
<p>「美國的魚雷，在戰爭初起時，等於不發，大部分似乎使用陳舊的東西，然而最近所發射的不問其對手是漁船也好，〇艇也好，都是很猛烈，所以不能大意。</p>
<p>卑劣似畜生的美國鬼，祗找弱的東西去擊沈，對此殘暴性，斷然殲滅之敵愾心，如火般燃燒起來</p>
<p>「日本的潛艦，一發一發的魚雷，都先在神前祈禱之後，方才發出，所以並不想打弱小的對象物，這一點，在精神上就大不相同。」</p>
<p>「我當時曾當過艦長，發見潛水艦時最好的措置，祗要一直向之直衝。敵人打算逃散時，此方面捨身突進，向敵方慌忙潛水的地方投下魚雷，這是最好的方法。」</p>
<p>晚餐前，這裏全體的船員出到甲板體操，更練習統劍道的擊劍。祇要一見到這情形，手中就要揑着一把汗，渾身感到緊張。看去似乎在轉瞬間可以擊碎二三柄竹刀。海上的勇士在狹隘的甲板上猛烈地旋迥着，又着手審判勝負的下士官橫在中問鼓舞着：</p>
<p>「再向前突進，打倒對手。」</p>
<p>眞是壯烈的東西。兵士們的　志，就是這樣地蓄積起來的。記者們正在注視時，不知道在那麼時候來的艦長，也在一旁看着可靠的部下在練習：</p>
<p>「在〇〇隊中間，這裹是最强的，下面正造柔道塲。」「這裏的〇〇勤務·瘦　是不以爲奇的，在南方，臉頰瘦削的很多。但在這裹是絕對不行的。」</p>
<p>的確，兵士們的　頰，如蘋菓般又紅又大，而色極佳。吉爾伯特和　幾尼亞的美兵，被這蓄積的銳氣所粉　的　候必將到來。全身　到貫徹兵士們肺腑的精神時，記者感到了燃燒般的　魂，不知不覺的也似一個武人了。</p>
<p>移到砲艦</p>
<p>翌日，我們報道班員，變成司令所搭乘的。砲艦的人了。此艦的司令是一個善飲酒，擅打獵，並且是一個中國通、還有一件，他尚是獨身，我們已經久記其名了。記者的這期待沒有錯、我們會見後，司令議論風生，雖然他日以繼夜的東海注視敵潛水艦的活動，但盡情的指摘中國的現狀，充分表示了他的稅利的判斷與深刻的含蓄。曾記得去年十月一日，從香港滿載英兵俘虜航行中的里斯本丸，被美國的潛水艦襲擊時，本艦曾充分發揮了日本武士道的精華，盡力救助，而建下了殊勳。於是就訪問艦長室，傾聽當時的情形，「不，那種事現在更：」一面把他的魁偉的巨體向後仰着，一面滔滔地講那次的情形「那天，我們負起補充聯絡的任務，向上海方面進行中。接到「里斯本丸被美潛水　壑的電報，迅即掉過艦首，進向出事地點。那時遠在早晨，到達出事地點，已快近黃昏了。機艙浸水的里斯本丸、左舷大傾側，除英兵俘虜之外，並有義勇軍。在瓜達爾加納爾島用戰車無情　輾軋我已經失却了自由的將士，或用機槍掃射我不持武器的漂流者，這憎無可憎的敵人，今又倒戈自相殘殺，使行將葬埋海底的英軍俘處，深深地被我海軍的武士道精神所感動。</p>
<p>「救助他們」的命令下來了。我們沒法拖曳那船。我軍兵士已經從砲艇移到本艦上，但担任護送敵俘虜的警戒兵及船長以下的船員尚殘留着。想到這裹，便下「退航命令」，把漂浮在海上的人用粗竹竿繫上了繩　起來。俘虜們的眼裹，簌簌地流下感激的淚。彼他們所視爲一家人的美國潛水艦所襲擊。以爲無救了，而現在竟出乎意外地獲救，所以都喜出望外。大家都異口同聲的痛恨美國。後來就那樣乘本艦到上海。」</p>
<p>「曾說在東海，美國的潛水艦亦時常出沒。現在說說警戒美國潛水艦的辛苦的情形。」</p>
<p>「敵潛水艦在東海出現者頗少，近沿岸的地方水色旣茶濁，水的深度又淺，所以敵潛水艦的危險率極少。可是近沿海岸航仃的商船，航程旣不熟悉，又有黑礁的危險，終於不能不在離岸較遠的洋面航行。潛水艦欲和這船取得聯絡而加以保護，在精神上是很辛苦的。加以中國沿岸小島極多，視野不便時，恰似船形浮在那裏，在夜間的　戒上，有細心注意的必要。」總之，浮在水平綫上的小島，要識別其是不是船團，極其困難，在夜間引導燈火管制中船團走着安全的航路，其勞苦眞不堪　狀。</p>
<p>「而且即使在一個船團中，因船的大，小，優，劣而其速度大不相同。速度遲緩的斗貨物船，在船團中珊珊而行，但任務緊急的船團當然不耐等待，先白進行。擔心貨物船而警戒中的。〇艦一面搜索一面歸來時，已經被敵潛水艦襲擊了，海面上祗浮沉着破碎的船體。實際上，要安全地護送種種性能不同的一個船團，須要不弱於父母之心的親愛與辛苦。」</p>
<p>「再說在擔任運輸任務而乘在船上的船員們之戰關心境。」</p>
<p>「這是從南方滿　　糧向日本運送中的船長所購的話……那船上的乘員，也和日本人一樣的比例，每天僅幾合米。到達的日數，爲避免敵潛水艦，常繞道而行，故多費時日，可是大家都非常心痛，恐怕在到達的時候，配給米都被他們在船上多消耗了。例如一艘船上雖然裝了八〇萬噸的米，却很擔心米的事情。幾個船員所食的米量，從總量說來，不過是滄海一粟，但是船員誰也不以爲少，誰都想能夠多拿一粒米回去。這些人們這樣赤誠地載回來的米。還要嫌不好吃者，價應該愧死。然而他們的道種苦心，不是白費的，等至船回故國，見到那縣的知事和市長出港迎接表示感謝的事實，則以前的勞苦也就撇在一邊，喜溢眉梢了。踴躍地再　上下次的輸送戰。」</p>
<p>「其次，說到後方的情形，關心些什麽事呢？」</p>
<p>「自己在大東亞戰爭的舞台中，奉公於東海，固然毫無餘念，不過偶然想到戰時後方的情形，非當牽掛。打開到得很遲的報紙看時，見到不快的記事，例如近日某財閥的華北事件，或大阪的教育疑獄事件，不能漢不關心。縱使在第三版祇有一批長短的簡單報道，也非常想詳細的具體的知道其內容。曾有通信統制，但終想知道後方的黑暗面。何况自己還有剛才入學期的孩子，這種事總很關心的吧！因為修養不足的緣故吧！哈哈……」</p>
<p>最後，以大笑結束他的談話。記者所感到複雜的情緒，暫時被濤聲所移。思潮不禁轉到自己居室中書桌上所放着的「怒　」雜記薄中，所摘錄的最近揭載於大陸新報上的栗本寅治氏之「明朗上海的建設」，林廣吉氏的「吾們的工作」二文中，討論「全面和平」「目前的物價問題」之「長江餘滴」中的感想文。</p>
<p>正月七日搗餅</p>
<p>說起正月七日，是淸算七草粥和供餅及切餅的時候，日夜在警戒中的〇〇砲艦甲板上，拍打拍打地用杵搗餅的聲音，驚醒了附近的帆船。</p>
<p>昨天等待中的糧食船到了。在海上警戒中的承兵們，對於此船的到來，比什麼都快活。幾乎全體出動，搬運　漬，醬油，魚，蔬菜，以及冷藏用的冰到船內。今天這糧船所帶來的餅米二包，使正月中的各種雜煮有了着落了。因艦長及主計長的溫暖的親心，爲水兵們的飲食而奔走，現在可以開始搗餅了。</p>
<p>石臼放在土台上，邊上有二包米，從食器用的大盤，用手搓的繩牢牢地縛在土合上，二個人的手　着二頭上面述結着用船的碎片和木材的破塊靈巧製造起來的平底的臼，杵是木工長親手造成的，共有二根。「完全像新成家的一樣一，誰在旁邊這樣笑着。最初由司令和艦長先搗，第一次做成的餅，米料一顆一顆的露在表面成績很不行「喂；再搗過的」。在揑弄的一等水兵愉快而憤慨地這樣說。大概因為用力過猛，連　底都搗穿了。那天晚上晚餐，大家都嘻嘻哈哈地用着有苦有甜的餅。</p>
<p>大詔奉戴日</p>
<p>雄壯的喇叭聲音，響澈了束海晴朗的曉空。桅杆上軍艦旗冉冉地上升，今日是一月八日之晨，司令以下全體穿着禮服，整襟佇立，嚴爾地凝視着軍艦旗招展着上升。背景是淡紅色肌紫色交錯着的彩雲，接連着無邊無際的水平綫，那正是綴飾着海上男兒服務於艦隊的光榮。寂靜無聲的一霎那，期望擊減英美而全身筋肉責張的兵士們之鬥魂，使整個軍艦變成一種生物，無聲的聲音充塞着四方，擴聲機中，主計長在捧讀宣戰的詔勅。司令的莊重的聲調，在朝的寂靜中蕩漾着，一句一句打入兵士門的心坎中。最後是司令的訓示：</p>
<p>司令首先說明大東亞一戰爭下中國的現狀，繼述鎭護東海的海軍部隊之東責愈趨重大，而要求兵士們更加奮勇後，一同參拜兵員室內祭祀着的艦內神社，祈禱必勝，於是感動的大詔奉戴式遂告終。</p>
<p>道一天早晨，艦內　社中新點了二盞燈。其左側是東鄉元帥的像，低下了頭，慈愛的眼睛，注視在祈禱中的勇士們身上，這種感銘的情景，不由得使記者的眼睛有些潤濕起來。</p>
<p>獵狩海賊</p>
<p>今天是難得的睛天，洶湧的波濤，也極平穩，爲了我們報道班員的一團高興，並船員們軒昂的士氣，決計到〇〇島的一部〇〇島去打獵。兵士們拿起了手頭的棍棒，準備立即移乘○艇上。不久，英姿颯爽的司令，一只手拿了獵槍下船來了。記者也携了一架照相機，〇艇噠！噠！噠！噠地蹴破了白的浪頭驀進着。波浪靜寂地響着迅速的節奏。一　眼，大小二十餘島展開在前面，帆船疏疏落落地點綴在各島岸邊，一片平靜優美的景色，恰似處身於瀨戶內海遊覽欣賞，將近預定的某島，換舟登陸，踏上了因風化作用而似乎貝彀化石化的小島之一角。狩獵開始了，獵卒們四周圍剿，司令則守候在山頂的岩石上，準備射殺被趕出來的野獸，海中的勇十們，從各方面攀附無徑的山道，從山脚下絡續趕上來。素稱健步的記者，也跟着一同走，雖在隆冬，也汗流浹背。第一次因牠們太快了，都被逃走。第二次，野獸被獵卒的包團四面逼撤來，正欲橫過頭上逃走時，被守在上面的司令瞄準了一下就打倒。第三次被趕出了許多很大的野獸但反被衝破獵卒的包團綫被逃走。「正想用這棍棒打到牠們的背上時，却被逃走了，牠們眞快啊！」大家都在這樣可惜着。</p>
<p>於是這次愼重地準備第四次的包圍陣。正在這時候，突然從東方海上傳過來砰砰的槍聲。大家都住足側耳靜聽，砰砰的槍聲，似乎還　續不絕。這太奇怪了，於是大家都跑上山頂，向那面看時，有三艘茶色的帆船，漸漸地向帆船密集的地方走近去，槍聲就是從那茶色的帆船中發出來的。</p>
<p>「是海賊船！」就在這樣呌着。</p>
<p>還在看悄形時，在二頭的帆船似乎四散逃走，當中的帆船，被海賊的示威槍聲嚇住了，那茶色的海賊船，並着那帆船，有一二分鐘沒有離開，忽然有二艘　海賊似乎離開了，可是却有一定的距離、向可這面來，看上去好像在拖着走。因為接近的緣故，這一　在海上突然展開的活劇，從山頂看得很淸楚。</p>
<p>「暫時停止打獵，選五名立即乘〇艇去檢查那像海賊的帆船！」命令終於下來了。</p>
<p>「啊！打獵一變而爲打海賊，這一下的收穫還一要大哩！」記者一手拿飯盒，也踴躍地從山頂踴躍而下，乘那檢查的〇艇。噠噠　　用全速急赴出事地點的〇艇，檢查機槍是否實彈，準備應變，到達出事地點時，下了帆船，祇有一只在來往徘徊着。立即上去檢查。</p>
<p>「良民證？船的號碼？……」</p>
<p>正在這樣直截爽快地訊問時，其中有三個像漁夫般的漢子，絮絮叨叨地在告訴着他們在做些什麽。他們的上海話，記者亦聽得出不十分純熱，似乎在說：「現在這船上祇有許多魚，如說別的什麽也沒有，就用棒打上來了。他們的服飾很壞」。</p>
<p>那茶色的帆船早已可斷定是海賊了。問他們往那一方向而逃呢？」祇答說「隱在鳥的崖壁中，自已的船被下了帆，此外就什麽也不知道了。」一好的，那麽再到那面去檢查那怪船」，〇艇重又　始前進，澈底檢查那二三船。可是不知道怎樣，似乎巧妙地逃避了。</p>
<p>「明天準備費一天的工夫，有組織的檢查近海的帆船，一定有懲戒這不逞的海賊船，　良民剷除不安。現在先暫時回去再說。」</p>
<p>大家都一致這樣决定了，於是回顧船頭，駛返拋錨的原地。那時東海上已經暮色蒼茫、淡月　　東升，向西方照耀着。（中國方面艦隊報道部派遣記者宮野，在東海〇〇砲艦上發。一月八日吉　譯</p>

<h3 id="c26">春臨 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>— 潔亞</p>
<p>新春的來臨；帶來了蓬勃的朝氣新的力量——。它啓示着我們引導向正確的道路，行進——它暗示着我們在烈火純靑里，洗煉潔凈。新春的——嫩田……它蘊藏得使人看不出來，好像是不許你看見似的，而竟含羞地暗自發芽：生長……它——憧憬着要比以前更來茂盛，更爲緊密。新春之最；是象徵着光的到來——我們的一羣，手牽牢着手，愉快地，大踏步的向目的地，行進着……。……我們都無語地；互現着堅强鼓勵的眼光，會心地微笑…。（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c27">一隻殘老的齒輪 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 凌祖仁</p>
<p>年靑的力是不會泯減的！年靑的雄心也是不會泯滅的</p>
<p>一雙殘老的齒輪，靜靜地躺在工塲的屋角裏，滿染着灰塵和污穢的輪軸，殘缺的齒牙…一切都表示着它已年華老去。是再也沒有絲毫靑春的活力了，是的！它的英雄時代是過去了，它也早給人們所遺忘了，祗有那一段過去褪色了的輝煌的史績，尚還縈繞在它那衰老的心底，永不會給忘記，舊夢的重溫，還會使它想起昔日鮮明的光榮，一絲回憶的溫暖，緊緊地裹住了它那疲憊冰冷的老心。</p>
<p>它淸楚地記得，常它早年被完美地裝配在那機器上時，它受過英雄的禮讚，敬仰，和崇拜，那時該多威武和榮耀呀！一天十二小時，它一小時也不休息地，負起工作的重担，替人類努力半產着，在它英雄的喊聲裏，鼓舞起了多少年靑的雄心，它奮起壯健的臂，指揮着其它同類的前進，它為人類寫下了多少血汗的史頁，它給人們帶來了溫暖的恩惠，也友愛地助着人類去向生活的惡魔抗爭，它挽救起了多少頹喪的生命，那燃起了人類生命之火，它時，有着多少的人類，是生活在它的齒輸下，它從不懂得躱懶和怠忽，它有着永不會老去的雄偉的力，它像一個不會給毀滅的英雄。</p>
<p>但是，好夢是不長的，無情歲月的飛逝，帶走了它年靑的雄心，熄滅了它　春的火花、它年老了·殘廢了，被遺紫了。它靜靜地退守在工塲的一角、讓灰塵和污穢來陪伴着它那殘老的冰心，展現在眼前的，是一個沒有光明，也沒有活力在跳躍的灰黯的環境，現在，英　的喊聲是嘶啞了，生疏了，不，簡直是無聲了，堅强的齒牙，發了銹，是殘鈍了，不老的雄偉的力，也給殘酷的現實掠奪去了、壯健的臂，也祗有在夢裏才會奮起了。……一切都結束了，祗有那一顆不死的心，仍是有着靑春堅毅的跳躍，它在期待，期待，期待着它的後一代……</p>
<p>當每天的浸晨，它聽得那熟悉的聲　，仍在不絕地嚮起時，它忍不住張大着那乾澀的喉嚨，想吐出那像早年的英雄喊聲，但是，老了的喉嚨是使它失望了，它默默地滴下了感傷的淚珠。它知道，這世界是屬於它的後一代的了！</p>
<p>呵！那親切而又像陌生的聲喊又嚮了！是的，那是它的後一代在英雄地喊着呢，像它早年時的一般，它就露出滿足的寂寞的笑，他想：世界是决不會給死寂所吞噬的哪！它知道在它的本位上，是站立着比它年靑時更努力，更勇敢的另一代同類，在代它執行着呼喚起年靑雄心的責任，和幹着為人類謀福利，和友愛地助着人類向生活抗爭的工作，它又愉快地笑了，笑得像靑年時的一般的康健，有朝氣，但是，却是無聲的！</p>
<p>那雄偉的英雄的喊聲又在　了！比它年靑時更雄偉的吶喊又在嚮了。它默默地想起了：「這世界是年靑的後一代的了，我們年靑的力是不會泯滅的，年靑的雄心也是不會混滅的。」</p>

<p>華影體育會篇電影從業員所組織，目的在敎練全人體格。其初也，軍率簡陋。自請錢旭滄君為顧問後，會務蒸蒸日上，其組織日臻完備，其球隊之成績，亦與日俱進。觀乎其籃球隊在西靑之戰績，益信其然，而迭受外塲邀請，前往作表演，總能予良好印象，洵可欽佩！該公司一年一度之聯歡會，本年特加體育表演，事前由該會負責人岳楓吳文超舒適等會同顧問錢旭滄，精密硏討，舉行節目凡九項，均以本年度新出影片為名，盡所以不忘其本也。而各節目深合片名，抑且饒有興趣，故樂為之記述如次：</p>
<p>該表演於日前在古拔路安凱地舉行，該公司重要職員全體男女明星以及仝人家屬，不下千餘人，屋光燦爛，古拔路頭，熱鬧狀况，有非楮筆所能形容於萬一。茲先記各項節目解釋以及優勝賽員及其成績。</p>
<p>珠聯璧合（三十米台球徑賽）賽員手持乒兵板，上置乒乓球（不准墮地）作三十米徑賽比賽，蓋珠者球也，璧者板也。結果女星組龔秋霞先陳琦一步而奪得首名，成績十三秒。</p>
<p>不求人（五十米着衣徑賽）在跑道上起點置皮鞋，隔十米為領帶、終點鳥外套，每　負在起點時　先穿就皮鞋、然後打領帶，至終點穿外套、自拉自唱，不能求於他人，故名為不求人。結果男星組張雄用一分五秒，先自到達終點、穿正外套。</p>
<p>難兄難弟（五十米徑賽）難兄難弟影片為殷秀岑韓籣根所主演、故該賽即分胖子搜子兩組，結果胖子組，任仲山得冠軍，成績十一秒。股大胖欲速不能，屈居殿　。　子組岳楓榮　第一，　猴力拼得第二，成績八秒。臨時加女子組，胡楓人長脚快、首畢全程，次為袁美雲，周璇，　秋霞，成績十二秒，稍次於胖子組而已。</p>
<p>芳草碧血（二十米哥而夫蛋賽）出發點安置雞蛋，每賽員特哥而夫棒，驅蛋前進，然而蛋殊易破水黃並流，假定其為碧血，滿染於芳草上矣。唯規定有碧血流芳草者，（即蛋破）概不計分、結果懂　邦藩小心翼翼。未見其流碧血而達終點，成績十七秒二分之一。</p>
<p>失婦之間（拔繩比賽）興賽者為六對夫婦，分南北兩方，每方三對夫婦。繩中央置紅帕，看夫婦之間趨向何方者，即為優勝。結果優勝組為張善琨童月娟，徐欣夫顧梅君，嚴化社薇。失敗組為王引袁美雲，胡心靈　秋義，楊小仲司馬丹。</p>
<p>步步　　（五十米蔴袋徑賽）賽員手持蔴袋，脚套於蔴袋之內、乃　必跳躍前進，欲速則躍高步步高陞風趣之至。結果黃河步步高陞，成績十二秒二分之一，吳文超犯規殿後。</p>
<p>兩地相思（五十米男女盲目賽）起點處為女星，在二十五米處為男星。均以布蒙目、其對象均事先規定。待發令員發令後，各個對象用其事先預定之口號，女星模索前進，男星頻喚口號以待，待所獲對象，由糾察者證明無誤後，乃啓布。雙方跑到終點，其頻呼口號之際，實有兩地相思。欲得無從之概。結果嚴俊胡楓，先了思想債，成績十六秒二分之一。</p>
<p>鸞鳳和鳴（三十米扎脚徑賽）　加者富為女星，每一人扎脚並進，以示鸞鳳之意結果楊柳馬驥得勝成績十四秒。</p>
<p>其最後項、為夜長夢多，以天黑　舉行，從略。</p>
<p>按是項表演，雖似重於娛樂，然亦含有提倡體育之意義，且興趣定必濃厚，可稱熔體育與娛樂於一爐。記者深以為各學　等均可採用，其所　節目名目或用歷史偉人，或與敎材卜有深切關係之名目則與賽時之興趣，當能隨而增加。一方面易於　憶其所用之名目，於敎授及體育均有裨益焉。</p>
<p>比賽花絮</p>
<p>再附記比賽塲上之花絮，可資笑料、</p>
<p>兩地相思比賽時，呂玉堃童月娟亦為一對對象，結果各對象均已到達終點，而窟仍在頻喚「玉堃」，呂則亦號呼「老闆娘」，而不能得其人，久久始得、在呼喚時，眞如兩地相思，不勝其苦之哀號，皆謂表演最切。題曰，另予獎品，盲日呼喚一番苦。領獎雙雙笑嘻嘻，相思時苦。相會時樂，詼諧！</p>
<p>難兄難弟臨時加難妹組時，衆以為童芷苓人長脚快，必得冠軍，某君願以一比二之値賭東道、數目以二十為限、僅取興趣、數目雖　、與　者殊　，結果　一出脚使元寶翻身，雖起而再追、已不及矣，與暏者皆得勝利、某君則大負、產則笑不可止，某君乃疑其有意如此耳，然亦從呼負負。</p>
<p>步步高陞得第一者吳文超，總裁判判為犯規，蓋吳在半途會運翻觔斗前進二次，與步步高陸之名不符合，故取消，得第二名之黃河，照章升為第一，吳文超寃恨之餘云：「在蘇袋裏高陞云何者，翻觔斗亦不容易事」，衆皆大笑！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Political Power and Governing Power <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's greatest contribution to political science was to clearly distinguish between "power" and "ability." "Power" is "political power," and "ability" is "governing power." Political power belongs to the people, and governing power belongs to the government. Governing power is like the engine of a machine, while political power is like the critical brake of that machine. The theoretical foundation for distinguishing between political and governing power lies in a "people-based" stance, which is consistent with the Confucian idea of "the people are the most important."</p>
<p>Since the launch of the National Revolution in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the governing power of the National Government has been established in accordance with Mr. Sun Yat-sen's last instructions, but the political power of the Chinese people has been delayed because the military administration had just ended and the tutelage administration had just begun. The ten years from the 16th year to the 26th year of the Republic of China can be said to be a period of "only governing power, but no political power." During this period, Chinese politics and society underwent many changes, sacrificing the lives of many people and destroying countless national vitality. As a result, from the government's point of view, nothing could be implemented; from the people's point of view, nothing conformed to public opinion. Therefore, we dare to say that if the people have no political power, the government has no governing power. If the government wants to have strong governing power, it must first give the people strong political power.</p>
<p>After the National Government returned to the capital in the 29th year of the Republic of China, in addition to the Central Political Committee of the National Government, although the Kuomintang was the main body and absorbed members of other parties and factions or non-party and non-faction members, the rest of the government organizations remained the same as before the return to the capital. The people's political power was naturally out of the question. At the same time, it cannot be denied that the actual achievements of the National Government in the past four years are still far from the hopes of the people, and the implementation of policies has not yet reached the point of arousing the public. The crux of the problem need not be elaborated. Therefore, we dare to say again that the foundation of governing power lies in political power. Only with a strong people can a strong government be produced.</p>
<p>Now is the time of the Greater East Asia War, and it is even more critical. We do not want to talk about political theory, but only hope that the government and the people will work together as a guarantee for achieving the final victory. In view of this reality, we put forward a simple principle, hoping that China will have a strong government in the future, but we must first strengthen the power of the people. Only by establishing public opinion organs and allowing the people to participate in politics can the power of the people be strengthened, and then a strong government can be built.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, those in power often fear that if the people have power, it will be detrimental to their position. This kind of thinking is an obstacle to the government and the people working together, an obstacle to establishing a strong government, and an impediment to the overall situation of the country. In particular, the establishment of public opinion organs is, from the people's point of view, the first step in exercising political power. From the government's point of view, it is the ears and eyes of the government, and even more so the supporters of the government's governing power. Whether subjectively or objectively, there is an absolute need. When the people have the opportunity to express public opinion, and public opinion has the power to restrain, the people will naturally wholeheartedly support all policies implemented by the government that conform to public opinion, so that the government has full authority. We hope that the country will give the people political power, and the people will certainly give the government governing power. Only a government with the support of all the people is a strong government, and only a country with unity of purpose and mutual assistance can achieve the final victory in this great era.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Second Front Problem and the Relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Recent foreign dispatches have brought various rumors about the timing of the second front in Western Europe. The source is mainly from the United States, which is a truly wonderful contrast to the Soviet Union's silence, which has always strongly demanded the implementation of the second front. It was revealed at the Tehran Conference that the opinions of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on the timing and scale of the second front in Western Europe. Therefore, the Soviet Union's silence can be interpreted as trusting the promises of the conference. The winter offensive, which began around Christmas last year, has become increasingly fierce since the new year. According to common sense, the second front should naturally be implemented in response to the Soviet Union's winter offensive. However, on the British and American side, the appointment of Eisenhower and other anti-Axis invasion of Europe military leaders has only recently been completed. Judging from the activities of ships and the state of land transportation in Britain, they are only gathering a large number of troops in preparation for landing. However, before the Soviet Union's winter offensive ends, it seems questionable whether a large-scale second front that responds to this can be launched.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Britain and the United States, in terms of making full use of the Soviet Union's combat power since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and in terms of seeking the greatest effect with the least sacrifice, this winter offensive will of course allow the Soviet Union to consume Germany's combat power on the Eastern Front as much as possible, hoping to weaken the resistance to the British and American landing operations. However, during this delay in the timing of the second front, the Soviet army has reached the old German-Soviet border. Regarding the Soviet Union's military actions, all parties believe that there is no need to advance further westward. If so, can the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union continue to be coordinated smoothly without any obstacles in the future?</p>
<p>Situation of the Winter Offensive</p>
<p>Looking at the progress of the recent winter operations, the Soviet Union is pursuing its own war objectives and conducting its own war, regardless of the implementation of the second front by Britain and the United States. Of course, in the new situation after the Tehran Conference, for the common purpose of carrying out the war against Germany, there will be no simple self-seeking between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union; there will also be a full understanding between the Soviet Union's winter offensive and the timing of the British and American implementation of the second front. But assuming that the Soviet Union recovers the old German-Soviet border in this winter offensive, the Soviet Union's war objectives will be temporarily completed, and what remains are the Balkan problems, etc. Looking back at home, there are still important issues such as the vast wasteland caused by the war in the past three years and the recovery of the exhausted national strength.</p>
<p>If the Soviet Union cannot recover the old German-Soviet border by spring in this winter offensive, nor can it implement the second front, then it may be quite difficult for the Soviet Union to devote significant combat power to the summer operations that will begin after mid-May.</p>
<p>On the British and American side, from various perspectives, after May is a good opportunity to launch the second front. By then, the preparations for invasion by land, sea, and air, in terms of troop strength and operations, will be fully prepared, and the climate conditions in Western Europe will also be conducive to the deployment of large-scale battles. But the difficulty lies in the degree to which the Soviet Union's offensive power in the east can be expected when the east and west are attacking at the same time.</p>
<p>British and American Attempts to Delay</p>
<p>Regarding the above ideas about the second front and the Soviet Union's winter offensive, the British and American side believes that if political relations with the Soviet Union permit, they seem to hope to extend the second front in Western Europe to around May. By then, the results of the Soviet Union's winter offensive will be clear, and while waiting for the consumption of Germany's national strength, their preparations for the "steady and cautious" landing operation will also be ready. The arguments of British military commentators Liddell Hart and others reflect this thinking. However, the "timing of the second front" decided by the three giants, Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill, at the Tehran Conference is probably not so late! It is roughly as early as February and as late as March. Then, does the Soviet Union know that the delay is until late spring and early summer? Liddell Hart's remarks and an article in The Sunday Times are probes to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>If the relationship with the Soviet Union does not allow for such a delay, and the second front must be launched immediately, then the possibility arises that Germany says it will become an excellent opportunity to strike and reduce Britain and the United States. Britain also knows this very clearly, so regarding the opening of the second front, even if the timing is late, it hopes to implement it only after everything is properly prepared. Before that, they will probably bombard the coasts of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, which are regarded as landing sites. That massive bombing has partially begun, but it cannot yet be regarded as a true massive bombing before the landing operation.</p>
<p>Germany's Determination</p>
<p>Hitler said in his New Year's proclamation: "My fellow countrymen, I am 100% certain that we will crush the invading enemy troops." On January 7, the German authorities announced in detail the defense situation of the thousands of kilometers of the west coast of the European continent from Norway in Northern Europe to the Pyrenees Mountains. This shows that Germany's countermeasures are already prepared for Britain and the United States' landing attempts, no matter when and where.</p>
<p>As the timing of the second front becomes more and more pressing, this issue has recently become the subject of reconsideration on the British side. This is extremely noteworthy politically and strategically. The second front currently provides various topics of discussion. However, it is wrong to think that Britain and the United States are afraid of the difficulties of implementing the second front because of this. They have indeed become aware of all the sacrifices and are determined to implement it. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 16)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Naval Air Battle over Rabaul, shot down 95 American planes, the Japanese Headquarters announced yesterday a glorious victory <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4 pm on the 30th: The Japanese naval air force and land/sea garrison forces intercepted approximately 210 American aircraft that attacked Rabaul twice on the 28th, shooting down 95 of them (including 10 unconfirmed) or more. Except for nine Japanese aircraft that did not return, there were no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced on the 30th the glorious achievements of the Japanese naval air force and land/sea garrison forces in the skies over Rabaul. From this, it can be seen that no matter how the enemy plots to invade Rabaul, the defense line is unshakeable. It is reported that the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 28th included 20 North American B24 engine bombers, 60 Grumman TBF carrier-based bombers, 30 Lockheed P38 fighter planes, 40 Vought Sikorsky T4 carrier-based fighter planes, a total of 166 new aircraft, 16 Bell P39 fighter planes, and 30 B25s and P38s, totaling 212 aircraft. This large formation of combined combat formations attacked Rabaul twice on the morning and afternoon of the 28th. The Japanese naval air force immediately intercepted them in the air, and the ground troops also fired fiercely. As a result, 95 aircraft were shot down. The contents of the enemy aircraft shot down are as follows: (A) 86 aircraft were shot down by the Japanese naval air force (of which 7 were unconfirmed). (B) 9 aircraft were shot down by ground artillery fire (of which 3 were unconfirmed). A total of 95 aircraft were shot down (with 10 unconfirmed). This great victory is similar to the Rabaul air battle on November 2 last year, when several hundred enemy aircraft were shot down. It is truly a record of victory. The world should be able to learn from this the superiority of the Japanese naval aircraft combat skills and deeply believe that the defense of Rabaul is as solid as a rock.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency, citing well-informed sources in Berlin: German leader Hitler took advantage of the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule to deliver a speech at the headquarters on Sunday noon. His speech will be broadcast by all German radio stations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Today is the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in Germany. At 10:00 am, approximately 500 Germans residing in this city and Yokohama gathered at the Yurakucho Sangyo Kaikan in Kanda Ward, Tokyo, to hold the "Celebration Ceremony for the 11th Anniversary of the Nazi Party's Rule."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Hitler's Speech <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – German leader Hitler broadcast to the German people on the 11th anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, saying in his speech: "In the fifth year of this greatest war in history, no one can doubt the cause or goal of this world war. This war was launched by Britain, and its purpose is to maintain a European balance of power that is favorable to the British Empire. The era of those who thought that this war was only a European conflict is over. This</p>
<p>War's End</p>
<p>In any case, the elements that were previously used by Britain are now masters of their own fate. No matter how this war turns out, Britain's rule over the continent is certainly a thing of the past. Today's question is no longer whether the old balance of power in Europe will be restored after the end of this war. Today's question is who will occupy an absolute advantage in Europe after the end of this war. This is either the various ethnic groups of Europe represented by the most powerful country, or the Bolshevik giant. Some British newspapers say that the Soviet Union, after conquering Germany, will have no reason to continue advancing in Europe. This is nothing more than a Jewish trick, the purpose of which is to deceive the fools of Europe. It is also a deception to think that Britain will even lead a new war against the Soviet Union before the war is completely over. First, the victor in this ethnic war will never want his war goals to be specified by British newspaper reporters. Second, the poor remaining countries of Europe are afraid that they will not want to fight against the Soviet Union under the leadership of Britain, because the military future of this kind of battle is only considered hopeful by complete fools. Therefore, one thing can be completely certain, that is, there is only</p>
<p>One Victory</p>
<p>to be had in this war, and this victor is either Germany or the Soviet Union. The victory of Germany is the preservation of Europe, while the victory of the Soviet Union will be the destruction of Europe. This fact is very obvious, and even a slightly sensible Briton should understand it. If the British were to be as hypocritical as they used to be, things might not be so bad. But their retreat has been blocked by Jewish rope-pullers in the domestic political sphere. Therefore, the problem that Britain and the United States are facing today is no longer whether they will fight against Bolshevism themselves after the end of this war, but whether they will be able to resist Bolshevism in their own country. The promises that Europe actually expects from Britain have been best explained by the attitude of Britain and the United States towards Poland, Finland, the Baltic states, and the entire southeastern Europe. These countries have all been sacrificed by Britain. This is certainly not what ordinary people in London want to do, but because if Bolshevism were to win, Britain would not be able to stop all developments. Therefore,</p>
<p>Saving Europe</p>
<p>The problem of all countries and the whole of Europe is completely tied to the National Socialist German people, the German armed forces, and Germany's allied countries. If Germany were to unfortunately collapse, then no other country in Europe would be able to effectively resist the Bolshevik invasion. The Kremlin knows this point, so if the Bolsheviks were to win, the Soviet Union would put Germany in a state of eternal damnation. If this war were to fail, then the fate of the countries of Northern Europe and Southeastern Europe would be decided within a few months, and Western Europe would also be reduced to destruction in a short period of time. Ten years later, this most ancient cultural continent will lose all the characteristics of its former life. The German people are able to wage war today for the fate of Germany and the entire European continent thanks to the grace of God, because God, eleven years ago, enabled the National Socialist Party to come to power after a long struggle. If there had been no revolution of the National Socialist Party on January 30, 1933, then there would be no strong country in Europe today that could effectively resist the Bolshevik giant.</p>
<p>Germany previously</p>
<p>Because it was influenced by the Jews, it was almost impossible to control the Bolshevik threat even within the borders of Germany, let alone fight against the Bolsheviks outside of Germany. Although the Bolshevik revolution in Germany at that time did not completely succeed, the democratic Weimar constitution of Germany was unable to cope with the great tasks of modern world politics. In order to prepare for future battles, it was necessary to solve all tasks not only in the military sphere but also in the social and economic spheres. The National Socialist Party immediately began to implement its National Socialist plan eleven years ago, and finally established a country that, both internally and militarily, could live up to its mission to Europe. In 1933, the National Socialist Party faced four major tasks. The</p>
<p>Four Major Tasks</p>
<p>The solution to these four major tasks is not only related to the future of Germany and the salvation of Europe, but even the civilization of all mankind may depend on it. These four major tasks are: first, to solve social problems in order to restore internal social peace in Germany; second, in addition to the social and political union of the German people, to add a national political union. In other words, the Germany that was politically divided at that time must be replaced by a unified National Socialist state; third, the national state must immediately establish armed forces that, in terms of spirit, morality, humanity, and equipment, can serve as a tool for self-preservation; fourth, in order to defend Europe, it is necessary to merge the countries where the four German people live or the countries that have belonged to Germany for thousands of years. Eleven years ago, when the National Socialist movement came to power after a long struggle, the preconditions for solving these tasks had already been established. The German people were united in the party, so the establishment of the government in the second year was not due to the state but due to the National Socialist movement. The launching and implementation of the National Socialist revolution in Germany will be called one of the greatest events in history. The outcome of this war will be the victory of Germany and Europe. To every National Socialist, this is merely the expression of his belief. Today, not only the soldiers on the front lines, but also the soldiers in the rear are the guarantors of victory. The enemy is trying to use bombs to cause the collapse of the German people, but the result is only to strengthen the national bond between the National Socialist people and the state. We</p>
<p>Loyal to Our Beliefs</p>
<p>Go forward bravely, and the day when we break through the clouds and see the clear sky is not far away. Today, the greater the worries, the Almighty will reward them more heavily for their work. Therefore, although the enemy is as barbaric as a demon, the victory will belong to Germany as a result of the war.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German Air Force has been fiercely bombing the anti-Axis forces and their ships that landed at Anzio southeast of Rome on the 22nd, inflicting heavy losses on them. According to a German News Agency military reporter on the 29th, the German Air Force has sunk a total of four destroyers, eight cargo ships and transport ships, and five landing craft since the anti-Axis forces landed, with a total tonnage of more than 50,000 tons. In addition, it also sank three landing craft of unknown tonnage, and damaged three cruisers, six destroyers, with a tonnage of 175,000 tons. It is also expected that 35 cargo ships and transport ships that were heavily damaged and sank, 22 landing craft of about 5,000 tons, and 18 landing mountain boats of unknown tonnage. According to the above figures, these are the ones that have been identified. It is thought that the losses of enemy ships that have not been investigated are also considerable.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – According to a communique issued by the German High Command at noon today, German troops in the areas northwest of Kirovograd, southwest of Cherkasy, and east and southeast of Belaya Tserkov are currently launching fierce offensives against strong Soviet infantry and tank formations. Although Soviet troops broke through in several areas, their attacks on other parts of the front failed and were heavily damaged. During the German counterattack south of Pogrebishche, a large number of Soviet troops were encircled. The Soviet troops repeatedly tried to break out, but were repelled and are now being wiped out. The German tank column, attacking west of Polennoe, has overcome several locations, and the Soviet troops there have also suffered heavy losses. German tank commander Major General Schulz was killed in action while leading the charge. In the area west of Novograd-Volynsky, fighting has broken out again, and the Soviet troops' attacks have all been repelled.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the German troops launched a counteroffensive in the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet troops admitted for the first time last night that they had to make some concessions due to the fierce counteroffensive launched by the German troops two weeks ago. The Soviet Information Bureau's communique last night mentioned the fighting in the area, saying: "On the Vinnytsia front and north of Kristinovka, our troops continue to repel large parts of the enemy's infantry and tank attacks, and in accordance with the orders of the high command, we have evacuated several inhabited places." The German side claimed yesterday that the German counteroffensive in the area north of Kristinovka and east of Vinnytsia is progressing.</p>

<p>From the Bohai Sea southward, it is called the Yellow Sea. The vast expanse of the Eastern Sea contains continental silt, making the water turbid and yellowish-brown, vigorously washing the mainland coast. Connected to the azure South Pacific – the decisive battlefield of the Japanese-American navies – it differs only in color and is indeed a vital theater of the Greater East Asia War. Japanese naval blockade vessels are active there day and night, preventing the lurking of enemy submarines attempting to disrupt the sea lanes connecting the Japanese mainland and the Chinese mainland, which serves as a supply base. Surveillance vessels maintain strict vigilance to prevent smuggling ships from breaking through the blockade to connect with the Chongqing route. Amidst the astonishing victories in the South, the diligent efforts of the patrol vessels, distributed like capillaries throughout the entire Eastern Sea of China, are also worthy of gratitude. Not only are the transportation lines between Japan and the Chinese mainland protected, but also the sea lanes between the South and Japan rely on these vessels. Furthermore, Japanese naval vessels active in this sea area also fulfill the task of minesweeping, removing floating and magnetic mines; this is also worth reporting.</p>
<p>Farewell, Shanghai</p>
<p>"Assemble immediately before 00:00!" When this order arrived from the China Area Fleet Press Department, it was January 3rd, the New Year's sake still lingering in the air. Since last year, I had harbored a wish to convey the arduous efforts of the Japanese benefit-sighted troops active in the Eastern Sea along the Chinese mainland coast to those back home through our reporting team's meager pens. Unexpectedly, this opportunity suddenly arose. I hurriedly took out my camera, holding it in my hand, while solemnly reflecting on the late Marshal Yamamoto's motto, "Always on the battlefield." In the face of the biting cold wind, I ran to the riverside. On the mizzenmast of the flagship Izumo, the warship flag and the admiral's flag were hoisted today as well. The 〇〇 Maru, carrying reporters to the 〇〇 gunboat that the commander was on, nimbly navigated through the congested fleet of large sailboats, heading downstream on the Huangpu River, precisely at noon. The boat captain pointed to the Qing Tian Bai Ri flags fluttering above the sailboats on both sides, and said with emotion: "Before the Greater East Asia War, they all flew the British flag! Everything has changed in the past year or two!" Looking back at the Bund, the wreckage of the Conte Verde was already out of sight. The boat I was on was very fast. Stepping out onto the bridge, I saw a pine branch hanging on the mast, and various sizes of offering cakes displayed in the captain's cabin, making me deeply feel the wartime navy's refined tastes.</p>
<p>It took several hours to navigate down the turbid and narrow waterway. Unbeknownst to me, the boat had already reached the main stream of the Yangtze River, heading west towards the estuary. After passing Chongming Island, as we were about to head out to sea, the watchman told me, "Mr. Miyano, I see a convoy ahead." I widened my eyes and strained to look ahead, but I couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>"Please use this to look," the watchman said with a smile, lending me his binoculars.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I saw them. Six ships were spewing out hazy black smoke, heading towards us.</p>
<p>"There's also a large sailing ship next to them!" the watchman pointed out from the side.</p>
<p>Indeed, looking carefully through the borrowed binoculars, I saw a small black dot to the left of the six ships. Although it was near dusk and the sea horizon was quite narrow, he was able to accurately and quickly distinguish distant objects with his naked eye. This sharp eyesight was truly admirable!</p>
<p>"How can you see so clearly?" I couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"It's the result of training," he replied simply, but such sharp eyesight was enough to frighten even useless people into a cold sweat.</p>
<p>"Please look to the left, there is a Chinese naval training ship."</p>
<p>Following his instructions, I indeed saw a black shadow with three masts reflected in my eyes.</p>
<p>About an hour later, we passed the convoy.</p>
<p>"Good work!" I couldn't help but shout out.</p>
<p>The convoy completed its important mission and sailed slowly away.</p>
<p>Night at Sea</p>
<p>The boat carrying us temporarily anchored here. As the solemn bugle call disappeared into the twilight of the Eastern Sea of China, the warship flag slowly lowered from the masthead. I had been rocked and swayed by the boat for a long time, and my stomach was already feeling empty, so dinner tasted particularly good. After the meal, I chatted with the captain and the chief engineer over drinks. I answered their many eager questions about the situation back home and the state of the new China to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>"Ah, I've gained much wisdom. It's truly delightful! Please be sure to tell the soldiers..." "Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!" I felt very bad for them listening to my unworthy words.</p>
<p>Later, the conversation gradually turned to the events surrounding the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The captain opened his eyes slightly, recalling the past:</p>
<p>"When the submarine discovered the Prince of Wales in the Malayan waters, I happened to be in the submarine squadron as well. That was a day of rain and wind."</p>
<p>It is said that many of the crew members were seasoned veterans who had fought in the South.</p>
<p>"In that case, now that you're doing this silent and unremarkable work, everyone must be hoping to go to the active South as soon as possible, right?"</p>
<p>The answer to my question was:</p>
<p>"No, that's not the case. Based on their past experiences, the soldiers already understand that this kind of work is very important for the soldiers fighting on the front lines and for expanding productivity back home, so they are particularly at ease. Besides, even though we are here, we will go to the front lines once the order comes. The soldiers don't like doing flashy things as much as you think."</p>
<p>Hearing this answer, I felt so ashamed that I couldn't even lift my head. Back home, people are currently emphasizing the so-called slogan of "selflessness and devotion to public service," while these people, with a calm mind, are becoming selfless and devoted, almost divine beings, constantly practicing "selflessness and devotion to public service." Although I only spent one day on the boat, I already felt that it was a very arduous task, but they repeat this daily routine every day. Therefore, hearing those indifferent and unsurprising words, the Japanese Navy's roaring fighting spirit and training were deeply engraved in my heart.</p>
<p>Around eleven o'clock, the wind suddenly picked up, the sky was densely covered with clouds, and it finally started to rain. With this, the captain suddenly smiled and said:</p>
<p>"You can go to that gunboat earlier, because the schedule has been changed. We're setting sail tonight."</p>
<p>Listening intently, the wind seemed to have become a gale, as if some solemn and heavy cheers were coming from afar, galloping on the sea.</p>
<p>"Oh, in the middle of the night, in this kind of atmosphere?" The reporters were a little flustered.</p>
<p>"This is good for soldiers. I've set sail at night many times. This ship also departed at night to pick up the reporting team in Shanghai. After guarding at night, the soldiers' eyes can see even more clearly."</p>
<p>"We must have cat's eyes. Cat's eyes are suitable for the night." Finally, the captain repeated these two sentences.</p>
<p>"All hands to your stations!" With the order given, the anchor was raised from the sea, and the boat sailed southwest in the pitch-black, windy, and rainy sea.</p>
<p>"The decisive factor for those who are responsible for maritime patrol is to discover the target before the enemy. Fortunately, our Japanese eyes, whether by nature or training, are superior to those of the Western devils, so we have such victories." These were the words the chief engineer said when we said goodbye.</p>
<p>"Is that really the case?" I thought about the chief engineer's words and lay down on the rocking bed. I was about to fall asleep when I suddenly saw that the captain's bed in front of me was empty. Looking more closely, the bed sheets were without a wrinkle, and the bedding was folded as neatly as it had been originally.</p>
<p>Ah! The captain hadn't slept all night, he was commanding the boat's actions all night!</p>
<p>My seasick and weary body, and my sleepy head, were drawn to the attention by the snow-white, wrinkle-free bedding. I put on my coat and went to the steering room to see:</p>
<p>"There he is!"</p>
<p>The captain, who had been chatting and laughing with the reporters just now, was staring at the dark sea in front of him, where there was only a meter-wide beam of white light, peering through the window like an immovable statue. He was shouldering the responsibility of night patrol and the boat, standing at the very front of the boat, without blinking. Deeply moved, I was soaked in grateful sweat. I stared at him in a trance for several minutes.</p>
<p>Until the next morning, the captain never returned to bed. Nor did he use the morning.</p>
<p>When it was broad daylight, we arrived at the gunboat's anchorage. Countless seagulls, showing their white bellies, were flying around the front and back of the boat. The wind still hadn't subsided, and it looked like it was about to rain. A seagull flew off the side of the boat. Only when he saw the target, the gunboat, did the captain turn around, show his white teeth, and speak to the reporter.</p>
<p>Half a Day on the Gunboat</p>
<p>"The flagship 〇〇, which the commander is on, is currently on a 〇〇 mission, so please wait on the previous 〇〇 gunboat for a while. Your boat, because of 〇〇, please transfer your reporting team there and depart immediately."</p>
<p>Soon, 〇 boat came to meet us. Standing at the bow of the ship was a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old boy, probably belonging to the military support group. Separated from newspapers, magazines, and the streets, in this corner of the vast ocean, stood a young warrior who bravely stood up to the national crisis, working on the front lines of ensuring 〇〇 road. However, we only spent a short time, all night, and then parted, which made me feel a little lonely. 〇〇 crew members stood completely on the side of the ship, waving their hats at our two reporting team members. For this courage of the sea, the simple friendship of the brave men of the sea who took it upon themselves to be powerful men, there was no one who didn't feel passionate in their hearts! We promised to meet again and then parted.</p>
<p>"The next time we meet, it will either be in Rabaul or in Colombo."</p>
<p>With renewed spirits, we moved to the gunboat with the steam of the 〇 boat.</p>
<p>The captain of this ship was from Etchujima, so he was a vigorous lieutenant commander. When we presented him with the 19th year of Showa calendar and magazines, he was as happy as a child. He was a brave warrior who attacked the Malay Peninsula after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a brave warrior who landed in Borneo, and a battle-hardened warrior who completed every convoy escort mission until he arrived at the Sered Naval Port in Shonan last May.</p>
<p>"How is it? Have you encountered the American fleet recently?"</p>
<p>I asked.</p>
<p>"So far, I don't remember how many dozens of torpedoes I've taken. They haven't come much lately, and they probably won't come."</p>
<p>He replied with a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"How is the situation back home?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, I only went back once last year."</p>
<p>"Were you ordered to take a vacation?"</p>
<p>"It was a sanatorium. It was because I was injured at that time."</p>
<p>In the casual conversation, the face of a warrior was clearly visible.</p>
<p>"The American torpedoes, at the beginning of the war, were as good as not firing. Most of them seemed to be using old things, but recently, whether they are firing at fishing boats or 〇 boats, they are very fierce, so we can't be careless."</p>
<p>The American devils, as vile as beasts, only look for weak things to sink. The enemy's resentment, which resolutely annihilates this brutality, burns like fire.</p>
<p>"The Japanese submarines, each and every torpedo, is first prayed to before the gods before being fired, so we don't want to hit weak targets. This is very different in spirit."</p>
<p>"When I was a captain, the best measure to take when a submarine was discovered was to charge straight at it. When the enemy tries to escape, we make a desperate advance, and drop torpedoes where the enemy is hastily diving. This is the best method."</p>
<p>Before dinner, the entire crew came out on the deck to exercise, and even practiced kendo fencing. Just seeing this scene made my hands sweat and my whole body tense. It seemed that they could break two or three bamboo swords in an instant. The brave warriors of the sea whirled fiercely on the narrow deck, and the non-commissioned officer who was judging the outcome, stood in the middle, encouraging them:</p>
<p>"Advance further and defeat the opponent!"</p>
<p>It was truly a magnificent sight. This is how the soldiers' aspirations are accumulated. While the reporters were watching, the captain, who didn't know when he had come, was also watching his reliable subordinates practice:</p>
<p>"Among the 〇〇 teams, this is the strongest. We're building a judo hall down there." "The 〇〇 duties here are not considered hard, but in the South, many people have sunken cheeks. That's absolutely not allowed here."</p>
<p>Indeed, the soldiers' cheeks were red and round like apples, and their complexion was excellent. The time will surely come when the American soldiers of Gilbert and Guinea will be crushed by this accumulated vigor. When I felt the spirit that permeated the soldiers' hearts, I felt like a burning soul, and I unconsciously felt like a warrior myself.</p>
<p>Moving to the Gunboat</p>
<p>The next day, our reporting team became the men of the gunboat that the commander was on. The commander of this ship was a good drinker, a skilled hunter, and a China expert. Another thing was that he was still single, and we had long remembered his name. The reporter's expectations were not wrong. After we met, the commander spoke with great energy. Although he was watching the activities of enemy submarines in the Eastern Sea day and night, he fully pointed out the current situation in China and fully expressed his sharp judgment and deep implication. I remember that when the Lisbon Maru, sailing from Hong Kong full of British prisoners, was attacked by an American submarine on October 1st last year, this ship fully demonstrated the essence of Japanese Bushido and did its best to rescue them, establishing great achievements. So I visited the captain's room and listened to the situation at that time. "No, that kind of thing is more now..." While leaning his majestic body backward, he talked about the situation at that time in a torrent, "That day, we were on a mission to supplement the communication and were proceeding towards Shanghai. We received a telegram that the Lisbon Maru was being attacked by an American submarine. We quickly turned the bow and headed to the scene. It was early in the morning, and we arrived at the scene near dusk. The Lisbon Maru's engine room was flooded, and the port side was severely tilted. In addition to the British prisoners, there were also volunteer soldiers. On Guadalcanal Island, they mercilessly crushed our soldiers who had lost their freedom with tanks, or shot our unarmed drifters with machine guns. This hateful enemy, now turning against each other, deeply moved the British prisoners who were about to be buried at the bottom of the sea with the Bushido spirit of our navy."</p>
<p>"The order to rescue them came down. We had no way to tow the ship. Our soldiers had already moved from the gunboat to this ship, but the guard soldiers and the crew below the captain who were escorting the enemy prisoners were still remaining. Thinking of this, I issued a 'retreat order' and tied ropes around the people floating on the sea with thick bamboo poles. Tears of gratitude flowed from the prisoners' eyes. They were attacked by the American submarine that they considered to be one of their family. They thought there was no hope of rescue, but now they were unexpectedly rescued, so they were all overjoyed. Everyone unanimously hated America. Later, they boarded this ship to Shanghai."</p>
<p>"It is said that American submarines often appear in the Eastern Sea. Now tell me about the hard work of guarding against American submarines."</p>
<p>"There are very few enemy submarines appearing in the Eastern Sea. The water color near the coast is tea-colored, and the water depth is shallow, so the danger rate of enemy submarines is extremely low. However, merchant ships sailing near the coast are not familiar with the route, and there is a danger of black reefs, so they have no choice but to sail in the ocean far from the shore. It is very hard to protect and communicate with these ships using submarines. In addition, there are many small islands along the Chinese coast, and when the visibility is poor, they look like boats floating there. It is necessary to pay close attention to the night patrol." In short, it is extremely difficult to identify whether the small islands floating on the horizon are a convoy. Guiding convoys along safe routes at night during the lighting control is truly unbearable.</p>
<p>"Moreover, even within a convoy, the speed varies greatly depending on the size, quality, and condition of the ships. Slow-moving cargo ships linger in the convoy, but convoys on urgent missions cannot wait and proceed first. The 〇 ship, worried about the cargo ship and on guard, was attacked by an enemy submarine while searching and returning. Only the broken hull was floating on the sea. In reality, safely escorting a convoy with different performance characteristics requires the love and hard work no less than that of parents."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, let's talk about the state of mind of the crew members who are on board for the transport mission."</p>
<p>"This is what the captain of a ship that was transporting grain from the South to Japan said... The crew on that ship, in the same proportion as the Japanese, only have a few合 of rice per day. The number of days to arrive is long because they often take detours to avoid enemy submarines. However, everyone is very concerned, fearing that the allocated rice will be consumed too much on the ship by the time they arrive. For example, even though a ship is loaded with 800,000 tons of rice, they are very worried about the rice. The amount of rice eaten by the crew is only a drop in the bucket in terms of the total amount, but no one thinks it's little, and everyone wants to be able to take a grain of rice back home. Those who complain about the taste of the rice that these people have brought back with such sincerity should be ashamed to death. However, their kind of hard work is not in vain. By the time the ship returns home, seeing the governor and mayor of that prefecture welcoming them at the port to express their gratitude, the previous hard work is put aside, and their faces are filled with joy. They eagerly embark on the next transport battle."</p>
<p>"Next, what are you concerned about back home?"</p>
<p>"While I am serving in the Eastern Sea on the stage of the Greater East Asia War, I have no regrets. However, when I occasionally think about the situation back home during the war, I can't help but worry. When I open a newspaper that arrives very late, I see unpleasant articles, such as the recent North China incident of a certain financial clique, or the Osaka education scandal. I can't help but be concerned. Even if there is only a short report on the third page, I really want to know the details and specifics. There is communication control, but I still want to know the dark side of the home front. What's more, I still have a child who has just entered school, so I'm always very concerned about this kind of thing! Maybe it's because I don't have enough cultivation! Haha..."</p>
<p>In the end, he ended his conversation with a big laugh. The complex emotions I felt were temporarily shifted by the sound of the waves. My thoughts couldn't help but turn to the "Anger" notebook placed on the desk in my room, in which I had excerpted the recent articles "Construction of Bright Shanghai" by Toraji Kurimoto and "Our Work" by Hirokichi Hayashi, which were published in the Continental News, and the essay discussing "Overall Peace" and "Current Price Issues" in "Changjiang Yu Di".</p>
<p>Pounding Rice Cakes on January 7th</p>
<p>Speaking of January 7th, it is the time to settle accounts for the seven-herb porridge and offering cakes and cut rice cakes. The sound of pounding rice cakes with a pestle on the deck of the 〇〇 gunboat, which is on guard day and night, startled the nearby sailboats.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the long-awaited supply ship arrived. The soldiers on guard at sea were happier than anything else at the arrival of this ship. Almost everyone was mobilized to transport pickles, soy sauce, fish, vegetables, and ice for refrigeration into the ship. Today, the two bags of rice cake that this supply ship brought made it possible to prepare various types of miscellaneous stew during the New Year. Thanks to the warm hearts of the captain and the purser, who were running around for the soldiers' meals, we can now start pounding rice cakes.</p>
<p>The stone mortar was placed on the platform, with two bags of rice next to it. From the large plate for tableware, the hand-twisted rope was firmly tied to the platform. Two people's hands were holding two pestles which were ingeniously manufactured from fragments of ships and broken pieces of wood. The pestles were made by the carpenter himself. There were two of them in total. "It's just like a newly formed family!" Someone laughed nearby. The commander and the captain started pounding first. The first rice cake made had grains of rice exposed on the surface, and the results were not good. "Hey, pound it again!" A seaman said happily and angrily. Perhaps because he used too much force, he even broke through the bottom of the mortar. That night at dinner, everyone enjoyed the bitter and sweet rice cakes with laughter.</p>
<p>The Day of Reverently Receiving the Imperial Edict</p>
<p>The majestic bugle sound resonated through the clear morning sky of the Eastern Sea. The warship flag slowly rose on the mast. Today is the morning of January 8th. The commander and the entire crew stood erect in ceremonial dress, solemnly staring at the warship flag fluttering as it rose. The background was the colorful clouds intertwined with light red and purple, connecting with the boundless horizon. That was precisely the glory that adorned the sea men serving in the fleet. In a moment of silence, the fighting spirit of the soldiers who were straining every muscle in the hope of defeating the British and Americans turned the entire warship into a living being, and a silent sound filled all directions. In the loudspeaker, the purser was reverently reading the imperial edict of the declaration of war. The commander's solemn tone echoed in the morning stillness, striking the hearts of the soldiers word by word. Finally, there was the commander's instructions:</p>
<p>The commander first explained the current situation in China under the Greater East Asia War, then described how the duty of the naval unit guarding the Eastern Sea was becoming more and more important, and asked the soldiers to be more courageous. Together, they visited the ship's shrine, which was enshrined in the soldiers' room, and prayed for certain victory. The moving ceremony of reverently receiving the imperial edict then came to an end.</p>
<p>On that morning, two new lamps were lit in the ship's shrine. To the left of it was the portrait of Marshal Togo, who lowered his head, and his loving eyes were focused on the praying warriors. This moving scene could not help but make my eyes a little wet.</p>
<p>Hunting Pirates</p>
<p>Today was a rare clear day, and the surging waves were extremely calm. For the pleasure of our reporting team and the soaring morale of the crew, we decided to go hunting on a part of 〇〇 Island on 〇〇 Island. The soldiers picked up the clubs they had at hand and prepared to immediately transfer to the 〇 boat. Soon, the handsome commander, carrying a hunting rifle in one hand, disembarked. I also carried a camera. The 〇 boat kicked through the white waves and surged forward. The waves quietly sounded a fast rhythm. In an instant, more than twenty islands, large and small, unfolded in front of us. Sailboats were sparsely dotted along the shores of the islands, a peaceful and beautiful scenery, just like touring and admiring the Seto Inland Sea. Approaching the designated island, we changed boats and landed, stepping onto a corner of the island that seemed to be petrified by weathering. The hunt began. The hunters surrounded from all sides, while the commander waited on the rocks at the top of the mountain, ready to shoot the wild animals that were driven out. The brave men of the sea climbed the pathless mountain from all directions, following one after another from the foot of the mountain. I, who was known for my good walking, also followed along, and even in the middle of winter, I was sweating profusely. The first time, they were too fast, and they all escaped. The second time, the wild animals were forced back by the hunters' encirclement and were about to cross over their heads to escape when they were shot down by the commander, who aimed at them from above. The third time, many large wild animals were driven out, but they broke through the hunters' encirclement line and escaped. "Just as I was about to hit them on the back with this club, they escaped. They're really fast!" Everyone was lamenting this way.</p>
<p>So this time, we carefully prepared for the fourth encirclement. At this time, a bang bang gunshot suddenly came from the eastern sea. Everyone stopped and listened intently. The bang bang gunshot seemed to be continuous. This was too strange, so everyone ran to the top of the mountain and looked in that direction. There were three brown sailboats, gradually approaching the place where the sailboats were concentrated. The gunfire came from those brown sailboats.</p>
<p>"Pirate ship!" They were shouting like that.</p>
<p>While we were still watching, the sailboats with two heads seemed to scatter and escape. The sailboat in the middle was frightened by the pirate's demonstration gunfire. The brown pirate ship was alongside that sailboat, not leaving for a minute or two. Suddenly, two pirates seemed to leave, but they came towards us at a certain distance, looking as if they were dragging it along. Because of the proximity, this impromptu live drama that suddenly unfolded at sea was clearly visible from the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>"Temporarily stop hunting. Select five people and immediately board the 〇 boat to inspect that pirate-like sailboat!" The order finally came down.</p>
<p>"Ah! Hunting has turned into fighting pirates. This harvest will be even bigger!" I took a lunch box in one hand and jumped down from the top of the mountain and boarded the 〇 boat for inspection. The 〇 boat, rushing at full speed to the scene of the incident, checked whether the machine gun was loaded with live ammunition and prepared to respond to emergencies. When it arrived at the scene of the incident, it lowered the sailboat, and only one sailboat was wandering back and forth. We immediately went up to inspect it.</p>
<p>"Certificate of good citizenship? Ship's number?..."</p>
<p>Just as we were asking these straightforward questions, three men who looked like fishermen were babbling and telling us what they were doing. I could tell from their Shanghai dialect that it wasn't very pure. They seemed to be saying, "There are only many fish on this boat now. If you say there's anything else, we'll hit them with sticks. Their clothes are very bad."</p>
<p>It could be determined that the brown sailboat was already a pirate ship. "Which direction did they escape in?" They only replied, "They hid in the cliffs of the birds, and their ship lowered its sails. Other than that, we don't know anything." "Okay, then let's go inspect that strange ship over there." The 〇 boat started moving forward again, thoroughly inspecting those two or three ships. But somehow, they seemed to have cleverly escaped.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, prepare to spend a day, and organize a systematic inspection of the nearby sailboats. We must punish these unscrupulous pirate ships and get rid of the insecurity by eliminating evil people. Let's go back for now."</p>
<p>Everyone unanimously decided this way, so we looked back at the bow of the ship and returned to the original place where we had anchored. At that time, dusk was already vast on the Eastern Sea, and the pale moon rose in the east, shining westward.

<h3 id="e23">Measures for Issuing Construction Bonds to Be Separately Determined. No Adverse Impact on Currency <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) In order to promote the progress of construction projects, the National Government has decided to issue construction bonds with a total amount of 600 million yuan. All sectors of finance, industry, and commerce in this city are paying close attention. Although the issuance regulations have been promulgated, it is said that the detailed rules for the issuance method will be determined separately. However, in principle, the bonds will be issued by the Ministry of Finance and accepted or raised by the Central Reserve Bank. The accepted portion may be resold. The general idea is that the bonds will be absorbed by various banks through the Central Reserve Bank based on the actual conditions of each bank, similar to the issuance of food bonds. It is believed that the issuance of these bonds will play a decisive role in absorbing idle capital and channeling it into construction. There will be no adverse impact on the currency.</p>

<p>— Jie Ya</p>
<p>The arrival of the New Year brings vibrant energy and new strength—. It inspires us to lead towards the correct path and progress—it implies that we are refined and cleansed in the raging fire. The New Year's—tender fields... It hides itself so that people can't see it, as if it doesn't want you to see it, but it sprouts and grows shyly in secret... It—yearns to be more lush and closer than before. The most of the New Year is that it symbolizes the arrival of light—our group, holding hands tightly, happily, striding towards our destination... ...We all silently—mutually show strong and encouraging eyes, and smile knowingly... (Returned)</p>
<h3 id="e27">An Old Broken Gear <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Zuren</p>
<p>The strength of youth will never diminish! The ambition of youth will never die.</p>
<p>An old broken gear quietly lies in the corner of the factory, its axle covered with dust and dirt, its teeth broken... Everything shows that it is old. It has no vitality of youth left. Yes! Its heroic era is over, and it has long been forgotten. Only the faded glory of the past remains in its aging heart, never to be forgotten. Reliving the old dream will remind it of the bright glory of the past, and a trace of warm memory tightly wraps its tired and cold old heart.</p>
<p>It clearly remembers that when it was perfectly assembled on the machine in its early years, it received heroic praise, admiration, and worship. How majestic and glorious it was then! Twelve hours a day, it worked tirelessly, shouldering the burden of work, striving for human beings. In its heroic shouts, it inspired countless young ambitions. It raised its strong arms, directing the advance of other members of its kind. It wrote countless pages of blood and sweat history for mankind. It brought warmth and grace to people, and lovingly helped mankind fight against the demons of life. It saved countless declining lives. When it ignited the fire of human life, how many people lived under its gears. It never knew how to be lazy or negligent. It had the magnificent power that would never age. It was like a hero that could not be destroyed.</p>
<p>However, good dreams do not last long. The relentless passage of time took away its youthful ambition and extinguished the spark of its spring. It became old, disabled, and abandoned. It quietly retreated to a corner of the factory, letting dust and dirt accompany its old and cold heart. What appeared before it was a dim environment without light or vitality. Now, the heroic shouts were hoarse, unfamiliar, no, almost silent. The strong teeth were rusted and dull. The magnificent power that would not age was also plundered by the cruel reality. The strong arms could only be raised in dreams... Everything was over. Only that immortal heart still had the youthful and firm beat. It was waiting, waiting, waiting for its descendants...</p>
<p>When it heard the familiar sounds that still rang out incessantly every morning, it couldn't help but open its dry throat, wanting to utter the heroic shouts of its early years. However, its old throat disappointed it, and it silently shed tears of sadness. It knew that this world belonged to its descendants!</p>
<p>Ah! That familiar yet strange shouting sounded again! Yes, it was its descendants shouting heroically, just like it did in its early years. It showed a satisfied and lonely smile. It thought: The world will never be swallowed by death! It knew that on its position, another generation of its kind was standing, more diligent and braver than it was in its youth, taking over the responsibility of calling up youthful ambition and doing the work of seeking welfare for mankind and lovingly helping mankind fight against life. It laughed happily again, laughing as healthily and vigorously as it did in its youth, but it was silent!</p>
<p>The magnificent heroic shouts were ringing again! Even more magnificent shouts than it had in its youth were ringing again. It silently thought: "This world belongs to the younger generation. The strength of our youth will never diminish, and the ambition of youth will never die."</p>

<p>— Rong Ge</p>
<p>I am a camel,</p>
<p>Traveling in that vast desert. In that vast desert, I cannot find a blade of grass, a drop of water. All around is endless wind and sand. A gust of wind, a gust of sand, fall down, get up; no matter how difficult the journey, I have a strong faith, I will always struggle forward with the wind and sand! Struggle, advance, advance, struggle, muster courage, endure hunger and thirst, there is green grass and clear spring ahead.</p>

<p>— Xu Yang</p>
<p>I alone, travel across the wasteland filled with thorns. People laugh at me, oppose me, even scold me, ... but I silently, only towards the blood path walked out by the wounded ankles, I go. Climb high mountains, cross forests, wade through clear streams; endure wind and rain, wear stars and moon; now I have arrived at, the beautiful scenery that can satisfy the desires of the soul, flowers are fragrant, birds are delicate, lying on the velvety grass, how green is my mood!</p>

<h3 id="e30">Record of the Chinese Film Athletic Association's Sports Performance: A Fusion of Sports and Entertainment <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Film Athletic Association is organized by film industry employees with the goal of training and developing well-rounded individuals. In its early days, facilities were simple. However, since inviting Mr. Qian Xucang to be an advisor, the association's affairs have flourished, its organization has become increasingly complete, and the performance of its teams has improved daily. Observing the performance of its basketball team in the Western Youth Games further confirms this. It has received invitations from external venues to give performances and has consistently left a good impression, which is truly admirable! The company's annual party this year included a special sports performance. Beforehand, the responsible persons of the association, Yue Feng, Wu Wenchao, Shu Shi, etc., along with advisor Qian Xucang, meticulously discussed and planned nine programs, all named after new films released this year, in order not to forget their roots. Each program deeply resonated with the film title and was also very interesting, so I am happy to describe them as follows:</p>
<p>The performance was held the other day at the An Kai Di on Coubert Road. All the important male and female stars of the company, as well as family members, numbered no less than a thousand people. The building was brightly lit, and the atmosphere on Coubert Road was so lively that words cannot adequately describe it. Here is a record of the explanation of each program, the winning contestants, and their results.</p>
<p>珠聯璧合 (Zhu Lian Bi He) (Thirty-meter Table Tennis Ball Race): Contestants held a ping pong paddle with a ping pong ball on it (not allowed to fall) and competed in a thirty-meter race. "Zhu" refers to the ball, and "Bi" refers to the paddle. As a result, female star Gong Qiuxia beat Chen Qi by one step to win first place, with a time of thirteen seconds.</p>
<p>不求人 (Bu Qiu Ren) (Fifty-meter Dressing Race): On the track, the starting point had leather shoes, ten meters away was a tie, and the finish line had a coat. Each contestant had to first put on the leather shoes at the starting point, then tie the tie, and finally put on the coat at the finish line, all by themselves without asking for help, hence the name "Bu Qiu Ren" (Rely on No One). As a result, male star Zhang Xiong used one minute and five seconds to reach the finish line first and put on the coat correctly.</p>
<p>難兄難弟 (Nan Xiong Nan Di) (Fifty-meter Race): The film "Nan Xiong Nan Di" (Brothers in Trouble) stars Yin Xiucen and Han Lan'gen, so the race was divided into fat and skinny groups. As a result, in the fat group, Ren Zhongshan won the championship with a time of eleven seconds. Gu Da Pang wanted to go fast but could not, and ranked last. In the skinny group, Yue Feng won first place, and Zhao Hou worked hard to get second place, with a time of eight seconds. A women's group was added on the spot, and Hu Feng, with her long legs, finished the entire course first, followed by Yuan Meiyun, Zhou Xuan, and Gong Qiuxia, with a time of twelve seconds, slightly slower than the fat group.</p>
<p>芳草碧血 (Fang Cao Bi Xue) (Twenty-meter Golf Egg Race): An egg was placed at the starting point, and each contestant used a golf club to drive the egg forward. However, the egg was easily broken, and the egg yolk and white flowed out, assumed to be "碧血" (Bi Xue, green blood), staining the grass. However, it was stipulated that those with "碧血流芳草" (Bi Xue Liu Fang Cao, green blood flowing on the grass, i.e., the egg breaking) would not be scored. As a result, Dong Bangfan was careful and did not let any "green blood" flow, reaching the finish line with a time of seventeen and a half seconds.</p>
<p>失婦之間 (Shi Fu Zhi Jian) (Tug-of-War): The competitors were six couples, divided into north and south sides, with three couples on each side. A red cloth was placed in the center of the rope. The side towards which the couples tended was the winner. As a result, the winning team was Zhang Shankun and Tong Yuejuan, Xu Xinfu and Gu Meijun, and Yan Hua and She Wei. The losing team was Wang Yin and Yuan Meiyun, Hu Xinling and Gong Qiuyi, and Yang Xiaozhong and Sima Dan.</p>
<p>步步高陞 (Bu Bu Gao Sheng) (Fifty-meter Sack Race): Contestants held a sack and put their feet inside the sack, then had to jump forward. Wanting to be fast made them jump high, with the interesting image of "步步高陞" (Bu Bu Gao Sheng, rising step by step). As a result, Huang He rose step by step, with a time of twelve and a half seconds. Wu Wenchao fouled and came in last.</p>
<p>兩地相思 (Liang Di Xiang Si) (Fifty-meter Blind Male-Female Race): The female star was at the starting point, and the male star was at the twenty-five-meter point. Both were blindfolded, and their partners were predetermined. After the starter gave the order, each partner used their predetermined slogan, and the female star groped forward, while the male star frequently called out the slogan to wait. After the partner was found and confirmed by the supervisors, the blindfold was removed. Both ran to the finish line. The frequent calling of slogans created a sense of longing from afar, a feeling of wanting but not being able to reach. As a result, Yan Jun and Hu Feng were the first to settle their debt of longing, with a time of sixteen and a half seconds.</p>
<p>鸞鳳和鳴 (Luan Feng He Ming) (Thirty-meter Leg-tying Race): The competitors were female stars, each person tying their legs together and moving forward, to show the meaning of "Luan Feng He Ming" (harmonious sounds of the Luan and Phoenix). As a result, Yang Liu and Ma Ji won with a time of fourteen seconds.</p>
<p>The last item, 夜長夢多 (Ye Chang Meng Duo) (Long Nights, Many Dreams), was omitted because it was held after dark.</p>
<p>According to this performance, although it seems to focus on entertainment, it also contains the meaning of promoting sports. And the interest must be strong, so it can be called a fusion of sports and entertainment. The reporter deeply believes that all schools and other institutions can adopt it. The names of the programs can use historical heroes or names that are deeply related to teaching materials, which will increase the interest in the competition. On the one hand, it is easy to remember the names used, which is beneficial to both teaching and sports.</p>
<p>Anecdotes from the Competition</p>
<p>Also, here are some anecdotes from the competition scene for your amusement:</p>
<p>During the Liang Di Xiang Si competition, Lü Yukun and Tong Yuejuan were also a pair. As a result, all the other pairs had reached the finish line, but Lü was still frequently calling "玉堃" (Yu Kun), while Lü was also shouting "老闆娘" (Lao Ban Niang, boss's wife) but could not find her. It took a long time to find each other. When calling out, it was like longing from afar, an unbearable cry of sorrow. Everyone said it was the most appropriate performance. It was suggested that another prize be awarded, for the bitterness of calling out while blindfolded. They laughed happily when receiving the prize, bitter when longing, happy when meeting, humorous!</p>
<p>When a female group was temporarily added to the Nan Xiong Nan Di race, everyone thought that Tong Zhiling was tall and had long legs, so she would definitely win the championship. Someone was willing to bet at odds of one to two, with the number limited to twenty, just for fun. Although the number was small, the participants were very excited. As a result, Tong flipped over 元寶翻身 (Yuan Bao Fan Shen, a somersault) as soon as she started, and even though she got up and chased again, it was too late. Those who bet against her all won, and the gambler lost badly. Everyone laughed non-stop, and the gambler suspected that she did it on purpose, but still admitted defeat.</p>
<p>Wu Wenchao, who won first place in Bu Bu Gao Sheng, was judged to have fouled by the chief judge because Wu somersaulted twice halfway through the race, which did not comply with the name "Bu Bu Gao Sheng" (rising step by step), so he was disqualified. Huang He, who won second place, was promoted to first place according to the rules. Wu Wenchao, in his grievance, said: "What is the meaning of 'rising high in the sack'? Somersaulting is not an easy thing to do either!" Everyone laughed!</p>
<p>During the harmonious sounds, Sun Yan and Zhang Cuiying were in the lead as soon as they started, but the further they ran, the more lost they became. Overjoyed and oblivious, they sang and echoed each other. Unfortunately, they went the wrong way during the harmonious sounds, and Qian Xucang judged them to be disqualified, causing the harmonious couple to be filled with complaints.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Snippets from the Sports Field <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Wang Weizhen, a former star of the Patriotic Women's Basketball Team, works at the Asian Bank and is diligent and serious in her work. Her basketball skills are admired by everyone. Miss Tang Jinchang, who is also in the same team, is lively and graceful, and her basketball skills are impressive. It is said that she is now working in a hotel, so it is no wonder that Miss Tang's elegant figure is rarely seen on the basketball court!</p>
<p>Football star Zhang Zhaohan was injured in the leg and broke his foot during the match with the Jews. He was hospitalized and was discharged from the hospital the week before last. From now on, he has become a one-legged general and can no longer gallop on the battlefield. According to those who speak on Zhang's behalf, Zhang was originally a police officer and is now unemployed, so his livelihood is very worrying. It is hoped that the Donghua Friendship Association (Zhang was formerly a member of Donghua and transferred to the Friendship Association this season) will provide assistance!</p>
<p>Mr. Li Yaoting, the leader of the small football team of the China Trade Bank, is enthusiastic about sports. He has not only planned well for the China Trade team but also is determined to hold a small football league for the banking industry. It is hoped that he will realize his wish as soon as possible, which is also something that the banking and sports circles will be happy to see!</p>
<p>Hua Lian has three matches this week in Western Youth, which is really rushing through three passes. Although Hua Lian's hope of winning is very strong, I think they may be too tired. The Western Youth authorities probably intend to do this in order to benefit from it? I wonder what the Hua Lian authorities think!</p>
<p>The Huaying Women's Basketball Team has been practicing for a long time, and the fans' expectations are deep. Qian Xucang said: The skills are still poor, so they are delaying showing their faces. Someone from a certain women's basketball team is very willing to compete with Huaying. It is hoped that 君 (Jun, someone) will make it happen so that they can learn from each other. After a long time of practice, the skills can be improved. What does it matter if they win or lose? What does Xucang think? (Bi Xian)</p>
