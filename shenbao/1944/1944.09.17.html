<p>— 張紹昌</p>
<p>東亞民族的命運，已經到了最嚴重的階段，雖然都有必勝信念，但是否有了必勝的準備，同時縱有了信念和準備，又是否敢斷定那就是最安全之路，這是需要愼重研究的。當這存亡關頭，巳經不容許我們猶豫，我們旣無需責難當局，也不能毫無國民責任的盡委之於政府，我們每一個人都應當起來，盡所有的力量貢獻國家。日本國民也不必單替中國擔憂，中國國民也不必單替日本擔憂，我們應當多替自己擔憂，我覺得大家若都能替自己擔憂，我們的問題才可以解決。　　因爲感到局面一天比一天緊迫，中日兩國國民雖已大部覺悟，然仍無解決途徑，但是中日之間已不能再有絲毫謀略或誤會了。　　爲了中日兩國的前途，我不揣冒昧，謹以至誠，將個人的一得之愚，提出來和大家交換意見。　　以下以問答方式縷述：　　○……○……○問　中日兩方都有和平的誠意和決心麼？答　我們當聽到中日兩方的朋友互相質問着誠意和決心，我們總覺得這種發問是太優氣。若說兩方沒有麼，但戰爭的目的在和平而不在戰爭，若說兩方都有麼，而現在仍在戰爭狀態下。關於這種疑問是不能對質的，而是需要用銳敏的眼光來透視，用澈底的認識力來判斷的。問　中日問題爲甚麼還不能解決，原因何在呢？答　中日問題的所以不能解決者，總括起來產。祇是一個字—[信]，沒有了[信]的緣故。細分析起來有幾個原因：○忽視了國民的意志和力量。○事變以來的中日兩方的和平運動者中，有良心的，愛自國，亦同樣愛東亞的分子固不少，忘卻國家專謀私利的分子也頗多，縱今有好的計劃，所收的效果也都是僅利於個人而已。○日本政府所發表的對華聲明還有未完全實現的地方。問　怎樣才可以解決中日問題呢？答　爲求中日問題的澈底解決，需要用長期和緊急兩種辦法，這兩種辦法尤須同時進行。長期辦法是睦隣工作，爲了表明彼此的誠意和加深彼此的信賴，這也是必需的，詳細無庸解說，如果大家想要好，當然就有要好的辦法。至於緊急辦法則比較重要，而且旣複雜又困難。不過無論怎樣難的問題，祇要有胆，有識，也是用一個字便可以解決，就是一個[誠]。詳細說來要分[中日應當共同努力的]，和[中日兩方應當分別努力的]兩點。中日應當共同努力的是甚麼呢？○雙方勿再增加刺激與擔負。○自己分別整理自己本身，最應努力者是喚起國民對時局的正確認識，和摒除感情作用，以冷靜的理智設身處地來研究中日關係。○尊重國民意見。○剷除藉和平而謀私利的障碍分子。中日兩方應當分別努力的是甚麼呢？（甲）中國方面所應努力者，中國仍在存亡綫上掙扎着，不應有僥倖心而因循茍安，日本完全失敗，對中國不見得是有利的，和平區的同胞應領悟抗戰區的意志與環境，應體得自己的處在便於活動的立塲上的責任，不必顧慮，應速謀中國自立之路。抗戰區的同胞應以冷靜的理智來觀察時局與中國前途，低調固不可，高調亦危險，應深知國家的危難，體察政府的苦衷，速謀中國自立之路。（乙）日本方面所應努力者，○以事實博得中國國民的信賴爲最有效的辦法，雖屬老生常談，然除此別無善策，中國的對日問題絕非因一兩個領袖的主張而和或戰，國民欲戰領袖主和亦不成，反之國民欲和領袖主戰亦不成。○對華態度的改善，與對華的澈底認識。漸漸改善，然仍有少數人士尚未完全改善，這對中日問題影響很大。因爲日本是戰勝國，日本方面不先改善對華態度，中國對日本的信心是不能增加的。至於對華認識的一點，澈底的固很多，不澈底而自以爲澈底的也不少，故往往雖以誠意對人對事，因認識錯誤而悮大事，甚而至於適得其反。舊的對華觀與新的對華觀單獨都不能適用，因爲中國是一個穿了新衣服的奮人，必需以新舊合觀來認識才能明白。　　○……○……○　　前數日因旅居無聯看了一塲日本電影，片名[滿城風雨]，看到勝安房不顧性命與主戰派之反對，單身赴會西鄉隆盛，江戶城的百萬餘衆，在勝與西鄉愛國的赤誠下而得救的一段，非常感動，情節雖與中日問題不同，至少兩方非有這樣的偉人和這樣的精神是不足以解決中日問題的。　　因爲這是促使我寫這籍文字的原因，同時也願提出來供大家參考的。　　（本文作者，係北京日本研究社社長，對於　　　中日問題之研究，頗具熱忱。近旅行來滬　　　·發表是文，殊足提供中日人士的參考·　　　——編者附言）</p>

<p>— 武公</p>
<p>當記者到北京的時候，剛巧逢着每月一度的大東亞戰爭紀念日和我國參戰紀念日。這兩個日子，在華北方面，是規定爲決戰生活日。本月的決戰生活日在北京，第一天於上午十時全市警防團團員即出動於市內各衝要地點，對市民服裝加以點檢。原來這裹於決戰生活日的期間，一般市民都應身穿防空服，無論男女一律不許穿長衫，所以警防團有派遣指導員往街頭點檢的必要。所謂警防團，就是上海的自警團，不過這裹的警防團團員每人都穿着制服，較諸上海當然更覺整齊。到了十一時五十九分，只聽得景山汽笛長鳴，街市行人車輛即時停止，各於所在地默禱大東亞戰爭勝利完遂。同時各警防分團亦搖動汽笛，在街頭担任指導工作，並往各區防護組視察其各種組織，設施及訓練是否適當，直至十二時許始告訓練完畢。第二天是我國參戰紀念日，除各機關舉行紀念儀式外，也舉行防空訓練。　　在這二天決戰生活日中，全市市民都遵守當局規定禁止烟酒並公共宴會。市民一律穿防空服裝，而所有行人車馬也於大街上均須遵守交通規則，各公共塲所且勵行所謂[一列勵行]。新民會各地區青少年團均不辭勞苦，或在街頭指揮行人，或從事勤勞奉公工作。因之，在這裹的確比較能使一般人民充滿着決戰的意識。現在北京全市街頭都掘有防空壕，在空襲警報發出之後，街頭行人都應伏身壕中。記者在這二天中，會親往街頭視察，其防空訓練實施的成績，深感較諸上海爲有秩序，這大槪是因爲這裹警防團較有訓練的緣故吧！</p>

<h3 id="c45">卡維恩海面驅逐艦血戰記 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>在南十字星的光芒之下，訓練有素的日本海軍將士，正在廣漠浩瀚的洋上淌着汗流着血，爲了他們的祖國也爲了我們的東亞，堅苦地勇敢的活躍於風狂浪湧之中，與憑恃數量的敵軍作戰，奏起血的凱歌。下面就是日本驅逐艦隊某主計大尉親身經歷的血戰記錄，由此可以想像南太平洋的戰況是如何劇烈悲壯。　　在敵機時來空襲之下，雖然正是一月剛剛過了三天，但在我們已經不是正月了。我們已經爲了光榮的任務，下午在作戰基地完成了出擊準備。軍艦駛離綠色的基地，蹴着南太平洋的波濤，向作戰地前進。</p>
<h3 id="c46">換戰鬬服 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[換戰鬬服！]號笛狂鳴，傳令聲像電光一般傳了出來。我趕快換上新短袴新襯衫，上面再罩白軍服，跑到艦橋上去。艦橋上面，士官和守望員的銳眼正睥睨着大洋和蒼空。艦的兩舷以四十度內外的角度或左或右地搖擺着前進。夜色漸漸彌漫海上，我們的軍艦也不知不覺駛抵作戰的地點。此處已在敵機的制空圈中，我們非利用黑暗迅速完成任務不可。　　[機擊，在九○度！]左舷的守望員突然喊道。發自陸上的探照燈的背白光芒，開始在天空移動。不久，在交叉光的焦點中，明白描書PB2Y的姿態。豪華的烟火似的燐光，透過了黑暗前方分明浮現島的輪廓。彼探照燈捉住的PB2Y，狼狽地投下三個照明彈。未幾，震耳欲襲的炸烈聲接連不斷，艦的前後左右湧起了很高的水柱。我們的軍艦一邊執行任務，一連巧妙躲閃敵機的炸彈，機槍主砲，一齊動作，終於將它擊退。</p>
<h3 id="c47">各就配置 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>任務完畢首途歸來時，已是翌日（四日）的清晨。突然，悽厲的喇叭聲響了起來。是[各就配置]的命令。我馬上走到艦橋上去。　　[什麼事？]我問通信士。　　[急電，有力的敵機動部隊出現。]他答。　　不到五分鐘吧，左舷的守望員就高呌道：[左百六十五度，敵機大編隊！]艦橋上的空氣驟然更覺緊張，報告空襲的喇叭聲響遍繼內各處。守望員打着望遠鏡，一動也不動，宛如塑像。接着[敵機大編隊，戰炸雷連合，十架，二十架，三十架……數不清，約百架]的報告一連串飛來。此時，用肉眼也可望見天際芝蔴似的黑點，不住頷首的司令官一邊凝視敵機大編隊，一邊[二戰速！][三戰速！]地下令增加速力，他是打算通水道後在大洋上邊擊它們。立在繿橋上的司令，艦長以及全體士官，都烱烱然注視着敵機。　　[敵大編隊與本艦同行！]守望員又喊起來。飛機是快的，這種勢所必然的事，誰都強烈地感覺到。</p>
<h3 id="c48">對空戰鬬 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[最大戰速！]司令官再下命令。接着艦長[對空戰門[的命令也下來了。全武行於是開塲。　　[右百二十度，敵編隊出現！]抬頭向右舷上空一看，果然約有四十架團體粗大的敵機在白雲前面悠悠然和本艦同一方向前進。射擊的號令一下，艦上的機關槍立即一齊吐火。噓，噓，噓……曳光彈遮住了敵機編隊的進路。這當兒，敵機左冀向下，一邊向左旋廻，一邊開始向本艦急降下。是ＴBF。　　最初衝來的四架，突然打開粗大的　腹，放下克羅米色的大自來水筆似的空中魚雷。　　[向右急轉！]是破鐘似的沈昔。艦體一邊向左傾斜，一邊急向右轉。四枚魚雷曳着白色的浪尾，通過距右舷約二米的海面，向艦尾那方的珊瑚確疾駛，轟然一聲，湧起了牆壁似的大水柱。　　其次一瞬間，從左肉搏而來的敵機又發射了四個魚雷。　　[向左急轉！]始終不變的望着的聲音又在艦橋上響起來，艦體隨即向左轉灣。魚雷在離開左舷不到一米的地方像白綫似的穿過。接着又是三個魚雷落了空。這樣，不知是天保佑也不知是敵機本領不好，投下來的魚雷沒有一個打中我們的軍艦，祇是在它周圍掀起了飛瀑似的水柱。當我們好容易能夠看清兩岸青色的珊瑚礁時，敵機又開始用機關槍實行掃射。正好像是一羣蝗蟲擁向一株穩穗，八十餘架敵機一齊襲來，一架又一架，狂吼似的機聲，挾着拍拍拍密如連珠的機槍聲。敵機在艦橋上空盤旋，飛來又飛去，低到可以看清機的人員面目。</p>
<h3 id="c49">擊落敵機 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[擊敵！]在嚴然站於艦橋上的司令的號令了下，敵機一架一架被打之下來二時，在我上面的指指所中的年輕中尉巳中彈而亡，此外有許多戰友在執行命令時也想繼倒地，士兵也有不少飲彈陣亡。艦長的大腿也被敵彈打斷了骨，祗勒一塊皮連着，軍醫說要動手術將腳截去，艦長卻讓鮮血直流的腳無力地掛着，雙手緊緊握住艦橋的扶手，繼續指揮部下作戰。看到他這種奮不顧身的樣子，士兵們雖負了瀕死的重傷，也緊緊把住火熱的槍砲，不住射擊敵機。憑恃機數的敵空軍，似乎也怕這種門志，落潮似地退去。凱歌是我們唱的啦！　　爲了造戰死傷者報告的緣故，我走下艦橋，腳下是滑膩膩的，鼻子裹一股腥臭。定神一看，原來甲板上都是鮮血，每當艦身向左右搖動時，甲板上的血便流向左流向右。這種情景，看了使人渾身起慄。這難道眞是在二十分鐘之內所發生的事實嗎？夢也似的事情呵！我望着血浪，不禁茫然。　　我們的軍艦載着戰友的屍體，歸向綠色的基地　　迎着我們的是和出擊前一樣的島，綠色的椰子林，依然如故，但是我們的軍艦卻改了樣子。艦體彈痕櫐櫐，宛如蜂巢，甲板上躺着白粗布包的戰友的屍首。抵岸後屍體就在山麓下付諸荼毘。翌日黃昏，屍灰裝入白木箱，戰友們是歸來了。遺骨安置在士官室一隅飾以軍艦旗的祭壇上。我念着觀音經，爲戰友祈冥福。未幾，司令長官發下這回戰門的獎狀，我們立刻將它供在戰友靈前。　　翌六日大本營發表：[帝國驅逐艦於一月四日晨邀擊來襲卡維恩之敵機，擊隊其十二架……]我們聽到這次戰果的發表，不禁淚下。（翔：譯自八月十八日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 任淑芳</p>
<p>董大枬利李浣青結婚九年，生了三個孩子但從未紅過一次臉。　　這對夫婦常被人歆羨着，稱讚着，大枬雖不怎麼漂亮，可是很氣派，又會賺錢，才三十歲出頭就担任了二爿公司的經理。平時私生活極其規矩，不抽烟，不喝酒，也不賭錢。更沒有拈花惹草的那會事，雖說這樣，他並不是一個不解風情的人，和他夫人總是有說有笑的。浣青和大枬都是大學畢業生，以前浣青在學校裹是很出風頭的校花。現在是大枬能幹的太太。單說他們家裹佈置得那麼雅緻清潔，就使人知道這屋子的主婦是頗不庸俗了的。使她最感驕傲的就是她有這三個孩子，並且是三個男孩子，都長得又白又胖，和月份牌上畫的小孩一樣可愛。　　浣青平日很節儉，不大瞎用錢。這是大枬以爲最難能可貴的，照他這樣富裕，儘可多用幾個阿媽，大司務。但是浣青以爲自己夠應付粗細各事，所以祇用一個老媽子，煮飯和洗衣，有空時帮着領領孩子。大枬雖覺這樣浣青太辛苦了，但浣青一定不肯多用人，省錢是淮都聽得進的，日子長了，浣青居然把家庭弄得井井有條。雖然她額角上的縐紋漸漸深起來，但是丈夫是體貼的，孩子是可愛的，並且她的私房錢又在一天天增多起來，這些都能使她忘去了疲倦與衰老。　　太枬對於他太太，樣樣都滿意，就是似乎愛錢一點，好在他還賺得進，對於這點他是裝着不知的。還有孩子多了，浣青常因忙着照顧孩子而疏忽了丈夫的事，多少使大枬有些不快，但是他結果也總是原諒她的。　　大枬在業餘時候，常喜看些學術的書。什麼雜誌哪！月刋哪！很多很多碰到興趣好的時候也拖着浣青一同研究。在他們將結婚時，兩人時常起勁地辦論着一個問題，甚至於一個下午都在兩人爭執中過去，可是現在浣青除了發表她孩子的哲學之外，什麼也不感興趣，尤其是遇着英文的東西時，更是糟透，她總是逃避的說：[不要問我吧！我連二十六個字母也要忘了，]大枬聽了這話也總嘆息着說：[唉！女人讀書有什麼用！]　　雖說是有些地方他們夫婦倆合不來，但是他們還是快樂着，共同生活着，還是被人歆羨着稱讚着　　ＸＸ…ＸＸ…ＸＸ　　近來大枬忽然想學日語，他覺得目前的日語的用途很大，他就和浣青商量，她正在和最小的孩子做衣服，眼睛半開着想打瞌睡，她說：[隨便你好了，多懂一樣總是好的！]於是大枬就決定登報去請個日語教師來。　　第二天下午就有人來應聘，出乎意料之外是一個年輕女郎，她的裝束並不十分入時，衣服是寬袍大袖，走起路來卻給人一種飄飄然的感覺，頭發是捲得高高的，像是古裝頭，從各方面看來都是很特別。　　大枬很客氣地詢問她的履歷，才知道她是一個混血兒，名呌舊子，父親是中國人，在日本留學時娶了一位日本太太，她是從小生長在日本的，到十二歲才回到中國來，她在二十多年中接受了中日二國的教育，現在她父親去世了，母親本預備回國的，但是在中國十幾年什麼都習慣了，有許多地方使她留戀着，所以到現在還是住在中國。　　大枬對於這位家學淵源的女教師，很滿意。決定就聘請了她。浣青也很歡喜她，說她是充滿着東方的古典美，就說那對眼睛比西洋人藍色長睫毛的眼睛還要來得迷人。大枬本業不是沒有這種感覺。不過給浣青這麼一提似乎更鮮明了些。　　以後蓓子小姐每天下下來教一點鐘日語，她教得很好，大枬也很用心學，不知怎麼的大枬心理漸漸不安起來，自己也說不出是什麼原因，他好像記得十年前追求浣青時也是這樣。每天下午總是恍恍惚惚的，他深知這樣下去是非常危險，於是他瞞了浣青去買了瓶白蘭地想借着酒來遣散她那想犯罪的心情。但是，結果反而是增加了那熱辣的感覺。　　一個月過去了，大枬學會了最簡單的日語，起先他進步得很快，後來就不行了，常常新教的也讀不出來。蓓子不大愛多說話，有許多話總是用嘴角的微笑來代替了。而大枬覺得她的美就在這種不言中表示出來。他時常偷視她這種美態，蓓子是喜歡淡妝的。脂粉施得很薄。大枬覺得這樣更增加了她的天然美。　　浣青是整天忙着孩子和家事，一點也沒有覺察到她丈夫的變態。從前浣青是漂亮的，現在連頭髪都懶得好好地梳一下。大枬有時默默地把浣青和蓓子比較一下，他覺得浣青是差得太遠了。　　中秋節的一天，浣青預備了很多菜請蓓子吃晚飯，大枬比平常高興得多，吃飯的時候蓓子很客氣不大揀菜，多數是大枬揀給她的。浣青呢，手中抱了一個小的孩子，旁邊坐着兩個大的孩子，小的孩子在母親懷中亂動。已經使浣青不能安穩吃飯，加上兩個大孩子又爲了爭一塊肉大打出手，把飯倒了一桌，浣青祇得將手裹的孩子交給大枬，去收拾桌上的飯，這時大的孩子哭了，小的孩子也哭了，鬧得不可開交，本來這種事情是常有的，從前大枬並不覺得怎樣，現在卻感到非常不快。他想這樣大哭小呌實在沒有幸福可言。　　飯後，蓓子沒有多說話，浣青也沒有工夫陪她。就是大枬一搭沒一搭地和她說着。不久她就告辭了。大枬悵悵地在院子裹踱着，對着中天分外明的秋月，深深地嘆了一口氣，隨即回到自己房裹，倒在床上東想西想，一時也睡不着，這時他想起了電影[香箋淚]的事情，覺得自己的處境到很像。　　浣青照應着孩子們睡了，便到院子裹來。去年大枬是和她一同賞月的，今年大枬那麼早睡了，浣青也有些不快，但她是沒有工夫多想的人，一會兒就被別的念頭支開了。　　第二天·浣青帶了二個孩子回娘家·最大的孩子因爲要上學校讀書，所以沒有帶去，大枬辦公回來聽老媽子說少奶奶回娘家去，好沒說什麼，呌老媽子買了一包香烟坐在沙發上無聊地抽着，忽然他想浣青不在家到是一個好機會，可向蓓子表示一下，想着臉也紅了，他用力吸了幾口烟。　　浣青回來，已在晚飯後，一進門就看見大孩子發亮的眼睛，好像有什麼緊要的事要告訴她，不待她開口，孩子就低低的不清楚地告訴她說：[今天爸爸和先生打架……爸爸去拉她的手，先生就嚇得站起來，爸爸又去抓，她就拍拍打了爸兩下耳光，轉身就走了。現在爸爸還氣得在床上睡着呢！媽媽，這是我坐在樓梯上玩積木時看見的，連老媽子都不知道呢！]　　浣青聽了孩子的話，一時也呆了，因爲是孩子的話，還將信將疑的，雖這樣說，心裹一陣難過，眼淚早落了下來。當天晚上，大枬和浣青打破了九年來的紀錄，大吵了一塲　　第二天，蓓子來了一封辭職信，更證實了孩子的話，二人又吵了一塲。　　Ｘ……Ｘ……Ｘ　　大枬這塲破碎的春夢，外人一個也不知道，他們還是被人認爲是世界上最美滿最幸福的一對。大枬和浣青雖是言歸于好了，但在他們倆心中都已劃上一條創痕，像一隻被　過的碗，縱然是沒有碎，也已留下了一條磨滅不了的裂痕。</p>

<p>— 蔣衛羣</p>
<p>紗窗上，不知從那裹飛來了一隻蜜蜂，盲目地將頭頂撞着紗窗，嗡嗡作響，呌得越響，而頭頂撞得越利害。　　然而，豈不知道這眞是太愚笨了，牠爲了冀求光明，而不知其路徑，拚着一時意氣追求着，如此，就是到死爲止，也還是在紗窗內，而不能到光明的天地間去。　　在社會上也正多着像牠一樣愚笨的一羣，盲目的追求着光明，—不用理智去思索，考慮，結果終於墮入了無底的深淵了。　　須知道強盜，賊，惡人，……並不是初出娘胎就劃分出盜型，賊型，惡人型的，……也是爲了追求光明，而錯踏了一步，最後憑自己的意氣用事盲幹，終於落入不可自拔的途徑，試問生活於世界上的人，那一個不是希冀光明的呢？　　[嗡！……]之聲已經次第地微弱了，然而牠仍舊搖搖欲墜的頂撞着，我下意識的忙開了紗窗，這時牠被微風一吹，猶如服了一帖興奮　似的，向着大自然懷抱飛去，恢復了已往的矯健。</p>

<h3 id="c55">裁判偏袒，非戰之罪熊貓屈居季軍國人今後應重視壘球運動 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 苗山</p>
<p>本年全滬壘球公開聯賽，自我華隊熊貓加入以來，開歷年未有之盛況。且我華隊角逐，比賽水準因而提高，此乃應爲衆所公認者。華隊之加入，本欲奪取西人獨　之錦標，而提倡壘球運動，其志實可嘉。現熊貓各戰已完，在九月十四日對西青之戰，又幸慘遭失敗，屈居季軍。茲錄該賽戰程及感想於下：</p>
<h3 id="c56">戰績尚稱滿意今後應求進步 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>熊貓出戰七次，五勝二敗。其中以勝菲僑一役，表演最見出色。至於二次敗戰，除首戰敗於葡商紅，確係球藝不如人。至於敗於西青，在種種原因下，熊貓被迫失敗，此乃有目共覩，並非藝不如人，雖敗猶榮。</p>
<h3 id="c57">裁判存心偏袒西青舉止粗蠻 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>無論在任何西人所主辦之球賽中，華隊總歸不利，故壘球賽中，亦不能例外。在對西青一役中，裁判可利拉（Ｈerera）之存心偏袒，並非言過其詞，實爲有目共覩之事實。在塲名裁判，樂秀榮君及李寗，孫錦順諸人，亦爲華隊抱不平，據理力爭，亦屬無效。華隊受此刺激，軍心一蹶不振。且西青諸將，舉動粗野，如浮尼克上一壘時，故意猛撞壘手王念祖，致使球接而被迫撞跌，裁判仍判安打（Save）。又如西青日籍植島君在歸壘時，捕手王慶瑞接球後已觸其身，植島始踏壘，裁判又判安全一分，此次偏袒更彰彰明甚。華隊諸將更無心續戰，致使三·四·五局中，共失七分之多。此後偏袒事實，共達五次。</p>
<h3 id="c58">熊貓擊球乏術守壘全滬最佳 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>熊貓此番加入聯賽，已使西人大開眼界，雖不能榮膺冠軍，而熊貓守壘已爲中外一致公認爲全滬最佳。然在擊球方面，則未見佳妙。熊貓不能勝利，一半亦屬此因。觀乎戰西青一役中，在第二局中，會成滿壘，（Full　base），三人在壘。倘此時有善擊之王秀山山擊，則至少能使二人歸壘，而首獲勝利。惜王君乃東吳比較法科生，畢業在即，無暇出塲。至此唯一勝利機會，斷送一旦，實屬可惜。深望今後熊貓諸將努力，期待來年痛飲黃龍也。　　今日星期日上午十時，西青與葡商紅決奪本屆錦標於膠州公園。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sunday Commentary: A Respectful Admonition to Chinese and Japanese Patriots <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Shaochang</p>
<p>The fate of East Asian nations has reached its most critical stage. While both possess unwavering faith in their ultimate victory, the question remains whether they have made sufficient preparations for it. Moreover, even with faith and preparation, can they confidently assert that their path is the safest? This demands careful consideration. At this critical juncture of survival, hesitation is no longer an option. We need not blame the authorities, but neither can we relinquish our national responsibility entirely to the government. Each and every one of us must rise up and dedicate all our strength to the nation. Japanese citizens need not solely worry about China, nor should Chinese citizens worry solely about Japan. We should worry more about ourselves. I believe that if everyone could worry about themselves, our problems could be solved.</p>
<p>Because I feel the situation is becoming more pressing day by day, and although most of the people in both China and Japan have become aware, there is still no solution. However, there can no longer be any strategy or misunderstanding between China and Japan. For the future of both countries, I venture to offer my humble opinion with utmost sincerity, hoping to exchange ideas with everyone.</p>
<p>The following is presented in a question-and-answer format:</p>
<p>○……○……○</p>
<p>Question: Do both China and Japan have the sincerity and determination for peace?</p>
<p>Answer: When we hear friends from both sides questioning each other's sincerity and determination, we always feel that such questioning is overly optimistic. If we say that neither side has it, then the purpose of war is peace, not war itself. If we say that both sides have it, then why are they still at war? Such questions cannot be answered through simple confrontation but require sharp eyes to see through, and thorough understanding to judge.</p>
<p>Question: Why can't the China-Japan issue be resolved, and what is the reason?</p>
<p>Answer: The reason why the China-Japan issue cannot be resolved can be summarized in one word: "Trust". It is due to the lack of "Trust". Analyzing it in detail, there are several reasons: ○ Neglecting the will and power of the people. ○ Among the peace activists from both sides of China and Japan since the incident, there are indeed many who are conscientious, love their own country, and also love East Asia. However, there are also many who forget the nation and seek personal gain. Even if there are good plans, the effects are only beneficial to individuals. ○ The declarations made by the Japanese government regarding China have not been fully realized.</p>
<p>Question: How can the China-Japan issue be resolved?</p>
<p>Answer: To thoroughly resolve the China-Japan issue, both long-term and urgent measures are needed, and these two measures must be carried out simultaneously. Long-term measures involve good neighborly relations. This is necessary to demonstrate sincerity and deepen mutual trust, and detailed explanations are unnecessary. If everyone wants to be on good terms, there will naturally be ways to achieve it. As for urgent measures, they are more important, and also more complex and difficult. However, no matter how difficult the problem is, as long as there is courage and knowledge, it can be solved with one word: "Sincerity". In detail, it needs to be divided into two points: [What China and Japan should work together on] and [What China and Japan should work on separately].</p>
<p>What should China and Japan work together on? ○ Both sides should avoid further provocation and burden. ○ Separately, each side should put its own house in order. The most important efforts should be to awaken the people's correct understanding of the current situation, and to eliminate emotional factors, using calm reason to study Sino-Japanese relations from each other's perspective. ○ Respect national opinion. ○ Eliminate those obstructive elements who seek personal gain through peace.</p>
<p>What should China and Japan work on separately? (A) What China should work on: China is still struggling on the line of survival. It should not be complacent and idle, nor should it assume that Japan's complete failure would necessarily be beneficial to China. Compatriots in the peace zones should understand the will and circumstances of the resistance zones, and understand their responsibility to leverage their advantageous position for action. Without hesitation, they should quickly seek a path for China's self-reliance. Compatriots in the resistance zones should observe the current situation and China's future with calm reason. Being too pessimistic is not acceptable, but being too optimistic is also dangerous. They should deeply understand the nation's difficulties, appreciate the government's predicament, and quickly seek a path for China's self-reliance. (B) What Japan should work on: ○ The most effective way is to win the trust of the Chinese people with facts. This is a tired cliché, but there is no better strategy. China's policy towards Japan, whether it is peace or war, is definitely not determined by the views of one or two leaders. If the people want war but the leaders advocate peace, it will not succeed. Conversely, if the people want peace but the leaders advocate war, it will not succeed. ○ Improving its attitude towards China and thoroughly understanding China. Gradual improvements have been made, but some people have not fully improved, which has a significant impact on the Sino-Japanese issue. Because Japan is the victorious nation, if Japan does not first improve its attitude towards China, China's confidence in Japan cannot increase. As for the point of understanding China, many have a thorough understanding, but there are also many who do not have a thorough understanding but believe they do. Therefore, although they treat people and things with sincerity, they often ruin important matters due to misunderstanding, even to the point of backfiring. Neither the old view of China nor the new view of China can be applied alone, because China is a struggling person wearing new clothes. It must be understood through a combination of the old and new perspectives.</p>
<p>○……○……○</p>
<p>A few days ago, because I was staying in a place without connection, I watched a Japanese movie called "Full City in Storm." I was deeply moved by the part where Katsu Kaishu disregarded his life and the opposition of the pro-war faction, and went to meet Saigō Takamori alone, saving the million-plus residents of Edo Castle with the patriotic sincerity of Katsu and Saigō. Although the plot is different from the Sino-Japanese issue, at least the Sino-Japanese issue cannot be resolved without such great men and such spirit.</p>
<p>This is the reason that prompted me to write these words, and I also wish to offer them for everyone's reference.</p>
<p>(The author of this article is the President of the Beijing Japanese Research Society and has a great passion for the study of Sino-Japanese issues. He recently traveled to Shanghai and published this article, which is particularly valuable for the reference of Chinese and Japanese people. – Editor’s note)</p>

On the morning of the 12th, Japanese forces on the right bank of the West River occupied Gaoming (30 kilometers southwest of Sanshui), and are now attacking the Chongqing forces' positions in the vicinity, crushing their defensive attempts. They are also pursuing the defeated troops, inflicting heavy blows. On the 12th, 300 defeated Chongqing troops were discovered in the mountainous area north of Zhaoqing and were repeatedly bombed, resulting in their annihilation. In addition, the directly subordinated air units, under the command of the ground troops, closely cooperate with the water route opening units in the upper reaches of the West River and are continuously active.

In addition, powerful Japanese forces supporting this operation also captured Yongan Pass on the morning of the 13th. This place is a strategic transportation hub, and with the key points of the provincial border falling into the hands of the Japanese forces, the strategic posture of the Japanese forces in the interior of Guangxi Province has also been completely established. Dao County is located on the left bank of the Xiaoshui River and is an important city for transporting supplies from the south to Lingling and Hengyang.</p>

<h3 id="e8">Japanese Minister Iguchi Discusses Washington Talks <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Iguchi Sadao, Director of the Third Bureau of the Japanese Intelligence Agency, recently published an article in the Tokyo Shimbun, discussing the Washington talks, the gist of which is as follows: If Chongqing hopes that Japan will become a weak and small country, what will happen to the Asian countries? This is tantamount to removing the barrier that prevents the United States and Britain from invading Asia, destroying the light of all Asia, and making the Asian peoples forever oppressed under the iron chains of the United States and Britain. The first to become the prey of the United States and Britain will be the Chinese mainland. Chongqing relies on the assistance of the United States and Britain to continue the war of resistance. Today, Chongqing's actual situation is as reported by the Associated Press from Chongqing on July 7th: The Chongqing side is exhausted from fighting Japan. If the aid route to Chongqing is not opened, it will not be a major factor in this war. The true peace and security of Asia must be based on the strong neighborly unity and mutual assistance of the great Asian nations centered on a strong Japan and a strong China. Only when the Anglo-Saxon scourge is eliminated from the great Asian land can it be realized. We must reflect on this.</p>

According to a special reporter for the Canadian Press Association, the Soviet Union is unwilling to compromise on Poland, and the Soviet Union has not discussed current war goals. Therefore, serious foreign-related issues have arisen. Since Soviet representatives did not participate in the Quebec Conference, it is feared that negotiations on these issues will be very difficult. Roosevelt and Churchill have formed ideas about the Polish issue, but they still need to talk with Eden.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Hai Tong News Agency reports that a Swedish newspaper carried news from the Finnish capital: After Heikki, the leader of the Finnish delegation to the Soviet Union and Prime Minister, suffered a chest congestion, Land Chief Valtonen has temporarily assumed the role of acting head of the delegation.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that a Swedish newspaper reported that the Soviet armistice conditions have long been notified to the members of the Finnish cabinet. In general, these conditions are the same as those of last spring, including the cession of Petsamo and bases in the Gulf of Finland. The Soviet Union will control the Finnish army, and the Finnish army and the anti-Axis forces will jointly fight against Germany. Finland will pay US$600 million in reparations, the Aland Islands will be designated as a demilitarized zone, and the Soviet Union will establish consulates on the islands.</p>
<h3 id="e23">The Focus of the Eastern Front Shifts North; Soviet Forces Launch an Offensive Toward the Gulf of Riga <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Hai Tong News Agency reports: The focus of the Eastern Front has shifted to the north. Soviet forces have concentrated a large number of fresh troops in the rear, attempting to advance towards the Gulf of Riga. German aircraft detected this action by the enemy long ago. After a week of shelling, the Soviet forces attempted to establish a bridgehead on the other side of the Imbach River, but failed. On Thursday morning, the entire Latvian front, from Busk to Pskov, was indeed attacked by a huge offensive of approximately 40 Soviet divisions and several tank battalions. The artillery and aircraft assisting in the battle were numerous. The focus of the battle was on both sides of Busk, Modon, and the Varga River, but the Soviet forces failed to break through the German defense line. The German forces were prepared and concentrated fresh troops there, repelling the enemy's offensive with counterattacks at any time. The northern and eastern borders of East Prussia were very quiet, and only the Narief area on the southeastern border was still in action. The German forces east of Warsaw abandoned Praga after the Soviet forces broke into the east of the Vistula. German forces at the southern end of the Vistula River encircled and annihilated nearly two Soviet divisions near the Soviet bridgehead near Sandomierz. The battle at the Baski Pass in the Carpathian Mountains has not developed, and Soviet forces have not yet reached the summit of the pass.</p>

Furthermore, according to an announcement made by the Finnish government on the 15th, German troops have resolved to reject surrender advice and attacked Hogland Island, resulting in clashes with Finnish troops in the southern part of the island.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Decisive Battle Living Day in Beijing <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>When this reporter arrived in Beijing, it happened to coincide with the monthly Greater East Asia War Memorial Day and our country's War Participation Memorial Day. In North China, these two days are designated as Decisive Battle Living Days. This month's Decisive Battle Living Day in Beijing started on the first day at 10:00 AM, when all members of the city's civil defense corps mobilized to key locations throughout the city to inspect citizens' clothing. It turns out that during the Decisive Battle Living Day period, ordinary citizens should wear air raid protection clothing, and neither men nor women are allowed to wear long gowns. Therefore, it is necessary for the civil defense corps to dispatch instructors to the streets for inspection. The so-called civil defense corps is similar to the self-defense corps in Shanghai, but the members of the civil defense corps here all wear uniforms, which of course makes them look neater than in Shanghai. At 11:59 AM, the siren on Jing Shan Mountain sounded a long blast, and pedestrians and vehicles on the streets stopped immediately, each praying for the victory of the Greater East Asia War in their respective locations. At the same time, various civil defense sub-corps also sounded sirens, undertaking guidance work on the streets and inspecting various protection groups in each district to see if their organizations, facilities, and training were appropriate, until the training was completed around 12:00 noon. The second day was our country's War Participation Memorial Day, and in addition to various agencies holding commemorative ceremonies, air raid drills were also held. During these two days of Decisive Battle Living Day, all citizens of the city obeyed the authorities' regulations prohibiting alcohol, tobacco, and public banquets. Citizens uniformly wore air raid protection clothing, and all pedestrians and vehicles on the streets had to comply with traffic rules. All public places also vigorously promoted the so-called "one-line practice." Youth League members of the New People's Society in various districts worked tirelessly, either directing pedestrians on the streets or engaging in diligent public service work. As a result, it is indeed possible to make the general public more aware of the decisive battle here. Currently, air raid shelters have been dug on all the streets of Beijing, and after an air raid alarm is issued, pedestrians on the streets should lie down in the shelters. During these two days, this reporter personally went to the streets to inspect the results of the air raid drill implementation and felt that it was more orderly than in Shanghai. This is probably because the civil defense corps here is better trained!</p>

<p>Preventing Water Supply Interruption During Air Raids</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, in order to prevent the interruption of the water supply in Shanghai in the event of an attack, which would greatly affect fire-fighting water, is excavating more than 20 fire-fighting pools in the central locations of various districts of the city as a precautionary measure. Each pool can hold tens of thousands of gallons of water and is not allowed to be used at ordinary times, only for fire trucks in case of emergency. The construction of these fire-fighting pools has already begun. In addition to the Suzhou River, where workers are being sent by the Public Works Bureau to excavate, the naval baojia districts are having self-defense corps members take turns working voluntarily. Efforts are also being made to beautify the surroundings of the pools, so the project is vast. It is hoped that the baojia self-defense corps in various districts will continue to voluntarily select suitable locations and excavate smaller pools in order to cope with any emergencies.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Special Tax Office of the Finance Bureau Officially Established Yesterday <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Director Encourages Staff to Practice Integrity</p>
<p>The Special Tax Office of the Shanghai Special Municipal Finance Bureau was officially established yesterday (the 16th). Director Chen Junde arrived at the office to take up his duties at 9:00 AM that morning, and summoned his staff at 5:00 PM to give a speech, which was full of encouragement. An excerpt of his speech is as follows: "I have been ordered to preside over this office, and I am deeply ashamed of my shallow talent and lack of ability to fulfill this task. However, since I have been entrusted with the responsibility by my superiors and I have received the full assistance of everyone, I am filled with excitement and gratitude amidst trepidation. Today, taking advantage of the opportunity for everyone to gather together, I will briefly report on the principles that should be followed in handling matters in the future: ○ Practice integrity. All new and old staff members of this office must maintain their integrity, be diligent and thrifty in serving the public, and those who work in the field must be especially clean and self-respecting, and must not act recklessly. When dealing with merchants, they must be kind and amiable, and persuade them well, so that they do not evade taxes and be punished. As for the reasonable living of colleagues, I am absolutely responsible for guaranteeing it. In terms of employing people, I have always held the principle of talent-based, and I will never use private individuals. Everyone can work with peace of mind, and do not harbor doubts or disturb each other. ○ Eliminate malpractices. The special tax is one of the important tax sources of the country. In the future, investigators and tax collectors must handle matters in accordance with the regulations. In addition to the prescribed tax amount to be collected, there must be no extra demands. As for illegal shops, the severity of the circumstances should also be distinguished in order to determine the standard of punishment. All of you have considerable knowledge and experience in handling tax affairs. I hope that you can all provide as much advice as possible based on your experience, so that the inspection and collection system will become more perfect day by day, and the tax revenue will improve day by day. This is what I hope for deeply. ○ Improve the treatment of staff members and implement a reward and punishment system. Special tax is an important source of tax revenue for this city, so the treatment of staff members should be improved as much as possible so that they can maintain a decent life and focus on the collection work. I have also been ordered to formulate regulations on rewards and punishments for staff members. I hope that all staff members of this office can understand the importance of special tax work, and do not covet temporary small profits and bring trouble to themselves. This is what I earnestly hope for." The important personnel appointments within the Special Tax Management Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau have recently been decided as follows: The position of Section Chief of the Management Section will be temporarily held concurrently by Director Chen Junde. The Section Chief of the Investigation Section is Shi Hua, the Section Chief of the Audit Section is Li Wenda, the Section Chief of the Collection Section is Zhang Naixiang, and the Secretary is Sun Mingqu.</p>

<p>The city's poultry market is a government-supervised, merchant-operated market that concentrates on the sale of chickens, ducks, and wild game. The unified management organization of the market has been selected at Xiaodongmenkou on Zhonghua Road, and construction is being rushed to open the market soon. The office at 175 Guangdong Road has begun to handle registration procedures. Anyone in the city who is engaged in the business of chickens, ducks, and wild game and meets the qualifications of the market's business rules can register and enter the market according to their grade number.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Residents of the Nanshi District Receive Ration Certificates <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The household rationing matters in the Nanshi District (i.e., the former 7th District) were re-registered in April by the Food Bureau. Now, the Rationing Office, in order to make the rationing policy more smooth and meticulous, has specially printed a type of application certificate for residents of the Nanshi District to receive rationed goods. From September 11th to the 20th, it will be issued to each household by fangbao separately as proof for future periodical receipt of purchase certificates for various rationed goods from the office. All residents of households residing in the Nanshi District who have registered their households with the former Food Bureau should have their head of household bring their residence certificate chop, the five-part yellow household registration form from the fang office, and the household registration certificate from the police station, and pay a printing fee of ten yuan, and submit them to the Nanshi Certificate Issuing Preparatory Office (the original site of the former Food Bureau) in accordance with the regulations to receive the certificate.</p>
<h3 id="e30">All Stores Must Mark Prices on Goods for Sale <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>All commercial firms in the city should, in accordance with the approved prices, add labels to each item for sale, indicating the price, and post or hang the approved price list in a conspicuous place so that customers can clearly understand the actual price and the authorities can easily check. The Municipal Economic Bureau has repeatedly issued orders to all trade associations to instruct their members to comply. Recently, it has been found that many commercial firms in the city are complying in name only and not in reality, and have not yet complied. In order to suppress prices and implement spot checks, the Municipal Economic Bureau has strictly ordered all trade associations in the city to instruct their members to comply by a deadline. If they continue to violate the order, once it is discovered or reported, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Industry Department Explains the Powers of Inspection of Weights and Measures <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Weights and Measures Testing Institute believes that the inspection of weights and measures in various commercial firms by the Administrative Division of the First Police Bureau of the city and the administrative sections of its subordinate branches conflicts with the powers of the institute's enforcers. The institute has successively submitted reports to the Economic Bureau and the National Weights and Measures Bureau of the Industry Department, which have been forwarded to the Industry Department for review and instruction. Now, the Industry Department has issued instructions, stating that the inspection and enforcement of weights and measures are governed by laws and regulations, which do not allow for confusion. The request is to request the municipal government to forward the request to rectify the situation and to ensure that the inspection is carried out in accordance with the law in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Municipal Education Bureau Plans to Improve the Treatment of Municipal Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>It has been found that the treatment of teachers and staff in municipal elementary schools is meager, and their lives are difficult. The Municipal Education Bureau, as the responsible education administrative agency, should give special consideration to improving their treatment so that they can teach with peace of mind. It has recently been heard that the bureau has been working hard to plan and prepare a budget to be submitted to higher authorities for review and approval. It is also reported that educational laws and regulations are in urgent need of reorganization, so a Committee for the Reorganization of Educational Administrative Regulations has been specially formed, with Secretary Dai Yuheng appointed as the chairman, and the section chiefs and chief supervisors of each section as members. They have been working hard to reorganize the regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e33">French Tramway Raises Prices Without Authorization; Authorities Strictly Order to Stop <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Restore Original Prices and Await Review and Approval</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities have been trying to suppress prices. However, the French tramway and electric light company has, on the pretext of increased costs, increased the fares of trams and trolleybuses. The increase standard is surprising, reaching over 150 percent, with the minimum first-class fare being eight yuan and the maximum being twenty yuan. Trams are the most economical means of transportation for citizens. Now that the prices have suddenly risen sharply, the impact on people's livelihood is significant. According to this reporter's investigation, the Public Utilities Bureau did not receive instructions from the municipal government authorities regarding the French tramway company's price increase. Therefore, the company's unauthorized price increase was not approved by the Public Utilities Bureau, which is illegal. The company has now been strictly ordered to restore the original prices and await review and approval by the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Municipal Health Bureau Prevents Autumn Epidemics <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Now that it is autumn, the most common epidemics in the city are typhoid fever, dysentery, and a type of fever called "Shanghai fever." It is found that the causes are largely due to drinking unclean beverages or eating cut-open fruits, which allow typhoid fever or dysentery bacteria to invade the stomach and intestines, causing illness. The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to prevent the epidemic of typhoid fever and dysentery from intensifying, has, in addition to strictly cracking down on unclean food, ordered all affiliated hospitals and health branches to intensify free typhoid fever vaccinations for the public. It is also hoped that the public will be cautious about their diet, and especially pay attention to unboiled drinking water, such as uninspected local wells, to prevent transmission. The cause of "Shanghai fever" is generally due to being bitten by mosquitoes. After being infected with this disease, there is often a period of fever for several days. Although the mortality rate is not very high, it is very easy to spread or cause other complications. It is hoped that the public will take more precautions against mosquitoes, and especially avoid going to public places, to prevent infection. As for the Health Bureau, it has stepped up its mosquito eradication efforts. It is reported that there is a shortage of raw materials for the mosquito eradication potion, and they are currently working hard to purchase them.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. The Shanghai Buddhist Association, in conjunction with the Japanese Higashi Honganji Temple, went to Tilanqiao Prison to hold a memorial service and preach. More than 50 Chinese and Japanese Buddhists attended. After the priests Heitian from Japan and Zhen Gujue from our country completed the sacrificial rites, Mika Mingguang, the standing director of the association, introduced Dharma Master Xing Ci Fan Cheng, who preached to more than 5,000 male and female prisoners, promoting the meaning of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva's universal salvation of all beings, and distributed hundreds of copies of the Ksitigarbha Sutra and the Diamond Sutra to widely spread Buddhism and influence their character. It is also heard that the association has been dispatching preachers to various prisons every week to explain Buddhist scriptures in rotation in recent years. This preaching was an unprecedented expansion movement.</p>

<p>After the publication of an article titled "[Legal Question Doubt]" by Mr. Wei Yi in the social services column of the newspaper on the 14th of this month, the Shanghai District Court Clerk's Office sent a letter yesterday stating the following: "To the Editor of the Shen Bao: We have read a question raised about a legal matter in your newspaper’s social service column on September 14th. The description of the events surrounding the eviction case of the China Vocational Building Leasing Office and the East Asia Sports School is inconsistent with the facts. The Civil Court's handling of civil enforcement cases always requires an audit after an order or disposition is issued. Only after the case is approved for cancellation and filed can it be reported as closed. In this case, the creditor, China Vocational Building Leasing Office, requested the cancellation of the case with a written guarantee, but it has not been approved. At the same time, the third party, East Asia Middle School, stated that it had a lease relationship with the creditor before the lawsuit was filed. The court believes that it is necessary to investigate whether its statement is true, so the enforcement procedure has not been finalized and is being reviewed carefully. There is no doubt about this under the law. I hope your publication will publish this letter in the letter column to clarify the facts. Sincerely, Shanghai District Court Clerk’s Office, September 15, 1944." Yesterday's dispatch time was 6:50 p.m.</p>

<p>Since the opening of municipal primary and secondary schools in the former First and Eighth Districts on August 22nd, an after-school tutoring program has been implemented. The tuition fees collected are used to subsidize teachers and staff, but the Education Bureau had not approved this beforehand.

In order to prevent abuses, it has specifically formulated the "[Provisional Measures for the Management of Tutoring in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools in the Former First and Eighth Districts]" to be followed and reported for record. The text of these measures is as follows: "[Provisional Measures for the Management of Tutoring in Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools in the Former First and Eighth Districts]" ○ These measures are formulated for the purpose of supervising and managing the tutoring programs in municipal primary and secondary schools in the former First and Eighth Districts. ○ The tutoring time in each school must be at least one hour per day and must not exceed three hours, but it must not conflict with regular classes or hinder the integrity of school administration. ○ Schools may not force students to participate in tutoring, and the number of tutoring students may not exceed one-half of the total number of students in the school. ○ The tuition fees collected by each school for one semester should not exceed 1,500 yuan for senior high school students, 1,200 yuan for junior high school students, and 600 yuan for elementary school students who are students of the school.

<p>The Student Aid Office of this newspaper is deeply grateful to the Huafeng Trust Company for its generous donation of 15,000 yuan to rescue out-of-school youths yesterday. In addition, the Lisheng Trust Bank sent a letter stating that the Wu Mother Chen Tai Madam Scholarship for 15 students has been approved and is hereby announced, hoping that the students will collect it from this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao. The original letter stated: "To the Student Aid Office of Shen Bao: Our bank was previously entrusted by Mr. Wu Renjia and Mr. Wu Zhongren of the Wu Mother Chen Tai Madam Scholarship Fund to handle the management and distribution of the scholarship, and we are deeply grateful for the assistance of your newspaper! The list of students sent has been sent to Mr. Wu for screening. As the matter belongs to the scholarship category, which is slightly different from the nature of student aid, scholarships are awarded separately to those students with the best academic performance. If the scholarship students can maintain the specified standards in the next semester, they can continue to receive the scholarship until graduation. As for the amount of the scholarship, it will be determined based on the general tuition fee index. This year, four students are recommended by the Xinwen Bao, one student is recommended by the Zhengfeng Middle School, and ten students are recommended by the Shen Bao, for a total of fifteen students.

<h3 id="e45">A Destroyer Bloodbath off Cape Kawieng <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Under the Southern Cross, well-trained sailors of the Imperial Japanese Navy, dripping with sweat and blood, fight bravely and doggedly upon a vast and tempestuous sea for their country, and for a greater East Asia, combating an enemy with superior numbers and singing a bloodstained paean of victory. What follows is the first-hand account of a bloodbath, experienced by a Chief Petty Officer of a Japanese Destroyer Fleet. The grim and tragic fighting in the South Pacific may be imagined from it. While continually subject to enemy aerial attack, only three days after the New Year, this was no New Year for us. On this afternoon, we completed preparations at our base for an attack in the service of a great mission. Our ships left the green of the base, and cleaved the waves of the South Pacific, making way towards the war zone.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Changing into Battle Dress <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>[Changing into Battle Dress!] The whistle shrieked, and the order transmitted like lightning. I quickly changed into new shorts and a new undershirt, covered with a white military uniform, and ran to the bridge. On the bridge, the sharp eyes of officers and watchmen glared at the ocean and the azure sky. The ship swayed forward, rolling left and right within a forty-degree angle from both sides. Night gradually spread over the sea, and our warship unknowingly reached the combat zone. This area was within the enemy's air control range, and we had to quickly complete our mission under the cover of darkness. [Aircraft attack, at ninety degrees!] the port watchman suddenly shouted. The stark white beam of a searchlight from the land began to move across the sky. Soon, in the focus of the intersecting beams, the silhouette of a PB2Y was clearly outlined. Luxurious firework-like phosphorescence clearly illuminated the contours of the island ahead through the darkness. The PB2Y, caught by the searchlight, frantically dropped three flares. Before long, deafening explosions followed one after another, and high columns of water erupted around the warship. While carrying out its mission, our warship skillfully dodged the enemy aircraft's bombs, and the machine guns and main guns fired in unison, finally repelling it.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Man Your Stations <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>When we headed back after completing the mission, it was already the early morning of the next day (the 4th). Suddenly, a mournful bugle call sounded. It was the order to [Man Your Stations]. I immediately went to the bridge. [What's happening?] I asked the signalman. [Urgent telegram, a powerful enemy task force has appeared.] he replied. In less than five minutes, the port watchman shouted: [One hundred and sixty-five degrees to port, a large enemy formation!] The atmosphere on the bridge suddenly became even more tense, and the air raid alarm blared throughout the ship. The watchmen peered through their binoculars, motionless like statues. Then, a series of reports came in rapid succession: [Large enemy formation, combined torpedo and bomber attack, ten planes, twenty planes, thirty planes... too many to count, about a hundred planes!] At this moment, black specks resembling sesame seeds could be seen with the naked eye on the horizon. The commander, nodding incessantly, stared intently at the large enemy formation, and then ordered [Second battle speed!] [Third battle speed!] increasing the speed, intending to pass through the strait and engage them on the open ocean. The commander, the captain, and all the officers standing on the bridge fixed their eyes intently on the enemy aircraft. [The large enemy formation is heading towards our ship!] the watchman shouted again. The aircraft were fast, and everyone strongly felt that this outcome was inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Anti-Aircraft Battle <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>[Maximum battle speed!] the commander ordered again. Then the captain's order for [Anti-Aircraft Battle Stations!] came down. All-out combat began. [One hundred and twenty degrees to starboard, enemy formation appearing!] Looking up at the sky to starboard, sure enough, there were about forty large enemy aircraft in a group, leisurely advancing in the same direction as our ship against the white clouds. As soon as the firing order was given, the ship's machine guns immediately opened fire in unison. Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh... tracer bullets blocked the path of the enemy aircraft formation. At that moment, the enemy aircraft on the left wing dipped downwards, began to turn left, and started diving steeply towards our ship. They were TBFs. The first four aircraft that charged in suddenly opened their large bellies and released large, chrome-colored, fountain pen-like aerial torpedoes. [Hard right rudder!] A deep voice like a cracked bell rang out. The ship tilted to port and then rapidly turned to starboard. The four torpedoes, trailing white wakes, passed about two meters from the starboard side, speeding towards the coral reefs near the stern with a thunderous roar, sending up large pillars of water like walls. The next instant, enemy aircraft attacking from port again launched four torpedoes. [Hard left rudder!] The unchanging, watchful voice sounded again on the bridge, and the ship immediately turned to port. The torpedoes passed like white threads less than one meter from the port side. Then, three more torpedoes missed. Thus, whether it was divine protection or the enemy aircraft's poor skill, none of the torpedoes hit our warship, only causing geyser-like water columns to erupt around it. When we could finally see the green coral reefs on both shores, the enemy aircraft began strafing with machine guns. It was as if a swarm of locusts was descending on a sturdy ear of grain. More than eighty enemy aircraft attacked all at once. The roar of the aircraft, combined with the rapid-fire staccato of the machine guns, was deafening. The enemy aircraft circled over the bridge, flying back and forth, so low that the faces of the crew could be clearly seen.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Downing Enemy Aircraft <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>[Shoot them down!] At the command of the commander, who stood solemnly on the bridge, enemy aircraft were shot down one after another. At two o'clock, the young lieutenant above me was shot and killed. In addition, many comrades fell while carrying out orders, and many soldiers were also killed by bullets. The captain's thigh was also broken by an enemy bullet, held together only by a piece of skin. The doctor said that he needed to amputate the leg, but the captain let the blood flow freely from his leg, gripping the handrail of the bridge tightly with both hands, and continued to direct his subordinates in battle. Seeing his fearless appearance, the soldiers, though suffering mortal wounds, gripped their hot guns and cannons tightly and continued to shoot at the enemy aircraft. The enemy air force, relying on their numerical superiority, seemed to be afraid of this spirit and retreated like a receding tide. The victory song was ours! In order to prepare a report on the war dead and wounded, I went down from the bridge. The deck was slippery under my feet, and there was a fishy smell in the air. I looked closely and realized that the deck was covered in blood. Every time the ship rocked from side to side, the blood on the deck flowed to the left and then to the right. This scene made me shudder all over. Could this really have happened in just twenty minutes? It was like a dream! I looked at the waves of blood, stunned. Our warship, carrying the bodies of our comrades, returned to the green base. What greeted us was the same island as before our departure, the green coconut grove, still unchanged, but our warship had changed. The hull was riddled with bullet holes, like a honeycomb, and the bodies of comrades wrapped in white coarse cloth lay on the deck. After landing, the bodies were cremated at the foot of the mountain. The next day at dusk, the ashes were placed in white wooden boxes, and our comrades had returned. The remains were placed on an altar decorated with the warship's flag in a corner of the officers' room. I recited the Kannon Sutra, praying for the souls of my comrades. Before long, the commander-in-chief issued a commendation for this battle, and we immediately placed it before the spirits of our comrades. On the sixth day, the Imperial Headquarters announced: [On the morning of January 4th, the Imperial destroyer intercepted and shot down twelve enemy aircraft attacking Kavieng...] Hearing the announcement of this victory, we couldn't help but shed tears. (翔: Translated from the August 18th Asahi Shimbun)</p>

<p>— Ren Shufang</p>
<p>Dong Danan and Li Huanqing have been married for nine years and have three children, but they have never had a serious argument. The couple is often envied and praised. Although Danan is not very handsome, he is imposing, good at making money, and became the manager of two companies in his early thirties. His private life is extremely disciplined, he doesn't smoke, drink, or gamble. He is also not one to have affairs. Even so, he is not a man without tenderness, and he always laughs and chats with his wife. Both Huanqing and Danan are university graduates. Huanqing used to be a very popular campus beauty at school. Now she is Danan's capable wife. Just looking at how elegantly and cleanly their home is decorated, one can tell that the mistress of this house is quite refined. What she is most proud of is her three children, and they are all three boys, all fair and chubby, and as adorable as the children painted on calendars. Huanqing is usually very frugal and doesn't spend money recklessly. This is what Danan finds most commendable. Given his wealth, he could easily hire several "amahs" and stewards. However, Huanqing believes that she can handle all the big and small matters herself, so she only employs an old maid to cook, do laundry, and help take care of the children when she has time. Although Danan feels that Huanqing is working too hard, Huanqing refuses to hire more people. Saving money is something that everyone appreciates. As time went on, Huanqing actually managed the family affairs very well. Although the wrinkles on her forehead are gradually deepening, her husband is considerate, her children are adorable, and her private savings are increasing day by day, all of which allow her to forget her fatigue and aging. Danan is satisfied with everything about his wife, except that she seems to love money a little too much. Fortunately, he can still earn enough, so he pretends not to notice this. Also, with so many children, Huanqing often neglects her husband because she is busy taking care of them, which makes Danan somewhat unhappy, but he always ends up forgiving her. In his spare time, Danan often enjoys reading academic books. Magazines! Monthly journals! Many, many. When he is particularly interested, he sometimes drags Huanqing along to study with him. When they were about to get married, the two of them often enthusiastically discussed a question, even arguing over it for an entire afternoon. But now, Huanqing is only interested in expressing her children's philosophies, and she is not interested in anything else. Especially when it comes to English, it's even worse. She always avoids it, saying, [Don't ask me! I'm about to forget even the twenty-six letters of the alphabet!] Hearing this, Danan always sighs and says, [Alas! What's the use of women studying!] Although there are some areas where the couple doesn't get along, they are still happy, living together, and are still envied and praised. XX…XX…XX Recently, Danan suddenly wanted to learn Japanese. He felt that Japanese was very useful at the moment, so he discussed it with Huanqing. She was making clothes for the youngest child, her eyes half-closed, wanting to doze off. She said, [Whatever you want. It's always good to know more!] So Danan decided to place an advertisement in the newspaper to hire a Japanese tutor. The next afternoon, someone came to apply. Unexpectedly, it was a young lady. Her attire was not particularly fashionable. Her clothes were loose-fitting and long-sleeved, but the way she walked gave people a sense of lightness. Her hair was styled high, like an ancient hairstyle. In every way, she was very special. Danan politely inquired about her resume and learned that she was a mixed-race girl named Beizi. Her father was Chinese, and he married a Japanese woman while studying in Japan. She grew up in Japan and only returned to China at the age of twelve. For more than twenty years, she received education in both China and Japan. Now, her father has passed away, and her mother originally planned to return to Japan, but after living in China for more than ten years, she has become accustomed to everything. There are many things that make her nostalgic, so she still lives in China to this day. Danan was very satisfied with this well-educated female teacher. He decided to hire her. Huanqing was also very fond of her, saying that she was full of Eastern classical beauty, and that her eyes were even more charming than the blue eyes with long eyelashes of Westerners. Danan was not without this feeling. However, after Huanqing mentioned it, it seemed even more vivid. After that, Miss Beizi came every afternoon to teach Japanese for an hour. She taught very well, and Danan was also very diligent in learning. Somehow, Danan's mind gradually became uneasy, and he couldn't say what the reason was. He seemed to remember feeling this way ten years ago when he was pursuing Huanqing. Every afternoon, he was always in a daze. He knew very well that it was very dangerous to continue like this, so he hid it from Huanqing and bought a bottle of brandy, wanting to use alcohol to dispel his sinful thoughts. However, the result was that it only increased that burning sensation. A month passed, and Danan learned the simplest Japanese. At first, he made rapid progress, but later he couldn't. He often couldn't pronounce the newly taught words. Beizi didn't like to talk much, and often used a smile at the corner of her mouth to replace many words. And Danan felt that her beauty was expressed in this silence. He often stole glances at her beauty. Beizi liked to wear light makeup. She applied very little powder. Danan felt that this added to her natural beauty. Huanqing was busy with the children and housework all day long, and didn't notice her husband's abnormality at all. Huanqing used to be beautiful, but now she was too lazy to comb her hair properly. Danan sometimes silently compared Huanqing and Beizi, and he felt that Huanqing was far inferior. One day during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Huanqing prepared many dishes and invited Beizi to have dinner. Danan was much happier than usual. During the meal, Beizi was very polite and didn't pick much food. Most of the time, Danan picked food for her. Huanqing, on the other hand, was holding the youngest child in her arms, with the two older children sitting next to her. The youngest child was moving around in her mother's arms, making it impossible for Huanqing to eat peacefully. In addition, the two older children were fighting over a piece of meat, spilling rice all over the table. Huanqing had to hand the child in her arms to Danan and clean up the rice on the table. This time, the older children cried, and the younger child also cried, causing an uproar. Originally, this kind of thing was common. Danan didn't used to feel anything, but now he felt very unhappy. He thought that there was really no happiness to be had with such crying. After dinner, Beizi didn't say much, and Huanqing didn't have time to keep her company. Only Danan chatted with her intermittently. Soon, she said goodbye. Danan paced around the courtyard in disappointment, sighing deeply at the exceptionally bright autumn moon in the middle of the sky. Then he returned to his room, lay down on the bed, and thought about this and that. He couldn't fall asleep for a while. At this time, he remembered the movie "Tears of Fragrant Stationery" and felt that his situation was very similar. Huanqing took care of the children and put them to bed, then came to the courtyard. Last year, Danan and she admired the moon together. This year, Danan went to bed so early. Huanqing was also somewhat unhappy, but she was not someone who had time to think too much. Soon, she was distracted by other thoughts. The next day, Huanqing took two children back to her parents' house. The oldest child did not go because he had to go to school. When Danan returned from work, he heard the old maid say that the mistress had returned to her parents' house. He didn't say much, told the old maid to buy a pack of cigarettes, and sat on the sofa, smoking idly. Suddenly, he thought that Huanqing's absence was a good opportunity to express his feelings to Beizi. Thinking about it, his face turned red. He took a few deep puffs of the cigarette. Huanqing returned after dinner. As soon as she entered the house, she saw the big child's shining eyes, as if he had something important to tell her. Before she could speak, the child told her in a low, unclear voice, [Today, Dad and the teacher fought... Dad went to pull her hand, and the teacher was so scared that she stood up. Dad went to grab her again, and she slapped Dad twice, turned around, and left. Now Dad is still angry and sleeping in bed! Mom, I saw this when I was playing with blocks on the stairs. Even the old maid doesn't know!] Huanqing was stunned for a moment after hearing the child's words, because it was a child's words, she was still doubtful. Although she said so, she felt a pang of sadness in her heart, and tears fell down. That night, Danan and Huanqing broke their nine-year record and had a big fight. The next day, Beizi sent a letter of resignation, which further confirmed the child's words. The two had another fight. X...X...X Danan's shattered spring dream was unknown to outsiders. They were still considered the most perfect and happiest couple in the world. Although Danan and Huanqing reconciled, a scar had been drawn in both of their hearts, like a bowl that had been glued together. Even if it wasn't broken, a crack that couldn't be erased had been left behind.</p>
<h3 id="e52">A Bee <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Weiqun</p>
<p>On the gauze window, a bee, from who knows where, blindly bumped its head against the gauze, buzzing loudly. The louder it buzzed, the more violently it bumped its head. However, how could it not know that this was simply too foolish? It sought light, but did not know the path. It pursued with temporary enthusiasm, and thus, even until death, it would still be inside the gauze window, unable to reach the realm of light. In society, there are many foolish people just like it, blindly pursuing the light—without using reason to think and consider. As a result, they finally fall into a bottomless abyss. One must know that robbers, thieves, and evil people… are not born with a marked type of thief, robber, or evil person... They also pursue light, but take a wrong step. In the end, they act blindly on their own will, finally falling into a path from which they cannot extricate themselves. I ask, of the people living in the world, who does not hope for light? The sound of [Buzz!...] has gradually weakened, but it still bumps its head, tottering. I subconsciously hurried to open the gauze window. At this moment, it was blown by a breeze, as if it had taken a dose of stimulant, and flew into the embrace of nature, regaining its former agility.</p>

<p>In the long harbor of night, a dim street lamp, like the sorrowful gaze of a delicate woman; silent, the alley is like a dying python. X……X……X A sharp hawking sound, mixed with the broken, hoarse sound of a huqin, trembled in the evening breeze; closer, closer; shattering the silence of the deep alley. X……X……X Two blurred black shadows slowly moved on the ground; driven by the whip of life, the voice is hoarse, the strength is exhausted; still singing, singing; X……X……X The hawker walked far away, and the singing sound also moved far away, the back disappeared into the depths of the alley; the long alley became more quiet, more quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Referee's Bias Was Not the Fault of the Panda Team's Efforts, They Placed Third, and the Nation Should Pay Attention to Softball in the Future <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Miaoshan</p>
<p>This year's Shanghai Softball Open League, since the addition of our Chinese team, Panda, has seen unprecedented enthusiasm. Moreover, the competition of our Chinese team has improved the level of the game, which should be recognized by everyone. The addition of the Chinese team was intended to seize the championship that had been monopolized by Westerners, and to promote softball, which is commendable. Now the Panda team has finished all its battles, and in the match against Xiqing on September 14, it unfortunately suffered a crushing defeat, placing third. The record of the match and my thoughts are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Record is Still Satisfactory, and We Should Strive for Progress in the Future <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Panda team fought seven times, with five wins and two losses. Among them, the victory over the Philippine team was the most outstanding performance. As for the two defeats, apart from the first defeat to the Portuguese Red team, which was indeed due to inferior skills, the defeat to Xiqing was due to various reasons, and the Panda team was forced to fail. This was obvious to everyone, and it was not due to inferior skills. Although defeated, they were still glorious.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Referee Was Intentionally Biased, and Xiqing's Actions Were Crude <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In any sports competition hosted by Westerners, the Chinese team is always at a disadvantage, so the softball game is no exception. In the match against Xiqing, the referee, Herrera, was intentionally biased, which is not an exaggeration, but a fact that everyone witnessed. The referees on the field, Mr. Le Xiurong and Li Ning, Sun Jinshun and others, also felt injustice for the Chinese team and argued with reason, but it was ineffective. The Chinese team was stimulated by this, and its morale plummeted. Moreover, the Xiqing players acted rudely. For example, when Funike reached first base, he deliberately bumped into the baseman, Wang Nianzu, causing Wang to drop the ball after catching it. The referee still ruled a hit (Save). Another example is when the Japanese player of Xiqing, Mr. Zhidao, was returning to base. The catcher, Wang Qingrui, had already touched his body after catching the ball before Mr. Zhidao stepped on the base, but the referee still ruled a safe run. This bias was even more obvious. The Chinese team players had no heart to continue fighting, causing them to lose a total of seven points in the third, fourth, and fifth innings. After this, there were a total of five biased incidents.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Panda Team Lacks Hitting Skills, but Their Fielding is the Best in Shanghai <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Panda team's participation in the league has opened the eyes of Westerners. Although they could not win the championship, the Panda team's fielding has been unanimously recognized as the best in Shanghai. However, their hitting skills were not good. The Panda team could not win, half of the reason was due to this. Looking at the match against Xiqing, in the second inning, there was a full base, with three players on base. If Wang Xiushan, who is good at hitting, could hit at this time, he could at least let two people return to base and win the first victory. Unfortunately, Mr. Wang is a comparative law student at Soochow University, and he is about to graduate, so he does not have time to play. Thus, the only chance of victory was lost at once, which is a pity. I deeply hope that the Panda team players will work hard in the future and look forward to drinking victory next year. Today, Sunday morning at 10:00 a.m., Xiqing and Portuguese Red will compete for this year's championship at Jiaozhou Park.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Fuhua Cup Finals Today, the Four Strong Teams Will Be Out in Full Force, with Ample Strength, and It Will Definitely Be Wonderful <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Bimei</p>
<p>This publication has repeatedly recorded the vigor of this year's mini-football. Looking back at the most grand of all the cup competitions, it should be the first mini-football league that just ended last week, and the most exciting one is the Fuhua Cup held at Yiyuan at 10:00 a.m. today (the 17th). It is investigated that the Fuhua Cup is hosted by the Fuhua Tobacco Company, presided over by Cheng Bo'an, and Jia Youliang and Xu Zhihao are responsible for all the general affairs, all of whom are veterans, so the results have been remarkable. The most valuable thing is that the teams they invite are all first-class football players in Shanghai, and the company is purely for promoting interest in sports, so every game is open to spectators, and fans are happy to go, which is rare in mini-football competitions. It is heard that the game is scheduled to hold the finals today. There will be a final between Baima and Hequn, and another exhibition match will be added, in which Qiaolian will face Huanan, which will inevitably be an unprecedented grand occasion. The authorities, on the one hand, in order to show a slight restriction, specially sell tickets, each for 100 yuan. However, all income will not be deducted for expenses, and all will be donated to charity organizations. And all the expenses will be borne by the Fuhua Tobacco Company. It is also heard that the authorities will also invite the famous actor Zhou Xinfang to auction charity balls, and the movie star Bai Guang to give awards.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Baima <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Is the entire team of Donghua soldiers, with the addition of the famous Hong Kong defender Yan Shixin to join the war, adding luster to the brocade, and impeccable, and the connection between the three fronts is both desirable, and the shots all have foot heads, and Dai Linjing is also seeing the magic, allowing him to be one of the best performers in mini-football. The gold team's front is delicate, and the rear is broad, applying both softness and rigidity. Today's opponent is the Hequn team that has risen from the beginning, and the newborn is not afraid of tigers, but based on the achievements of Baima's elders, it should still be the horse's footprint.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Cohesion Group <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Cohesion Group is a rising team under the training of Dai Linjing. Mr. Dai's efforts have yielded considerable results. This year, the Cohesion Group has shown great promise in small-sided football, making people look at them with new eyes. However, today's performance is like showing off one's skills in front of Lu Ban (a master craftsman), requiring much thought. Mr. Dai may not be willing to criticize them excessively. Observing the Cohesion Group's efforts, Dong Jincai's goalkeeping can be described as top-notch. The two defenders are slightly weaker, and the forward Lu Qingxiang is energetic but lacks shooting power. Xiao Ziwen's footwork is good, but he lacks stamina, and Lei Shuping lacks experience. Therefore, although their coordination is considered tacit, due to the above shortcomings, they will inevitably be defeated. However, after a struggle, they will certainly not let White Horse win easily.</p>

<p>Organized by Xu Dongming, the team consists of Guangdong athletes and the northern athlete Xin Fuzhen. In terms of talent, they can be considered extremely strong. Figures like Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Xin Fuzhen, Sun Jinshun, Zheng Yingquan, and Liang Shutang are all well-known. Unfortunately, they have a very obvious weakness! That is, the forwards rarely score. Except for Sun Jinshun, the other generals, Zheng, Liang, Zhuang, etc., are not used to this. Otherwise, their achievements would be more than this. Today's performance against the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association (OCAA), with fierce clashes, may bring unexpected satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Overseas Chinese Athletic Association (OCAA) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The team's small-sided football performance last week against White Horse was highly praised, especially Mai Nidi's goalkeeping, which was lighter and faster than traditional football goalkeeping. He leaped like flying, and his quick saves made it seem like the ball was attracted to him by a magnet, which was most admirable. Now, the lineup has been adjusted again. Bao Jie has recovered from his illness and resolutely joins the team, adding another scoring talent to the forwards, and the performance should be even better. In conclusion, White Horse is more likely to win today's final, while the outcome of the exhibition match between South China and OCAA is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Genius Female Player of the Affinity Team, Wang Weizhen <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>After the women's basketball and volleyball league is over, it has once again become quiet. In the two leagues, I think Wang Weizhen of the Affinity Team is definitely the most successful one. Wang Miss should be credited most for the Affinity Team's championship wins. Miss Wang's strengths can be introduced during the passing season to prepare for next season. She plays as a defender in basketball, and her quick sprints and steady interceptions make it difficult for the opposing forwards to fly. In fact, Wang is not only a great defender, but if she were to try being a forward, her chest-out posture under the basket would not only be excellent but also exceptionally prepared. Unfortunately, the Affinity Team has many forwards but few defenders, which prevents her from fully displaying her talents.</p>
<p>In volleyball, Wang plays the most important position in the second row, both offensively and defensively. She can certainly do her best, not avoiding any situation when saving the ball, and not caring about falling or diving. Her measured ball reception is especially commendable. Her mind is clear in battle, and in extremely frightening situations, she can sometimes deliver a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Miss Wang works at the Asia Bank, and her conscientiousness has earned her a promotion to team leader, which shows her thoroughness in handling matters. Her skills are like her service spirit, and her humble attitude after victory is loved by fans.</p>
<p>Wang is simple and honest, a true genius female player and model female player. Miss Wang will surely have an even more wonderful performance in the next competition. This article is to praise her, and we will wait and see in the future. (Jing Duan)</p>
