<p>東京二日中央社電　日大本營二日下午四四時發表：（一）日本航空部隊，十一月一日轟炸雷伊泰灣內之敵艦船，擊沉戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，擊毀戰艦三艘。（二）日軍航空隊自十月十六日以來，連日奇襲摩羅泰島之敵基地，每次均炸毀敵機場及附近設施。十月三十一日機奇擊，最爲成功，除敵飛艇四架起火墜落外，更使包括B24型之二架之多數敵機起火，機場一帶亦發生大火災，此次攻擊中，日機未歸還者有三架。</p>
<p>馬尼刺二日中央社電　菲律賓日軍航空部隊，連日對雷伊泰灣敵登陸部隊繼續猛炸，三十一日更襲擊雷伊泰島敵飛機場，塔克羅班及塔拉克機場，各三處中彈起火，塞巴布羅飛機場，二處中彈起火。又一日有大型機三四十架及P38型機三十餘架，來襲比薩牙地區之顧克塘巴羅特方面，日航空部隊與之展開空戰。</p>
<p>菲島攻防戰進入爭奪主導權階段</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　菲律賓之攻防戰，於陸海空三方面已均進入爭奪太平洋作戰主導權之階段，每一戰無不影響決戰前途繼續猛攻，敵軍依恃物量不斷增援，今已負重創。雷伊泰灣內沉沒或傾斜之敵艦與日俱增，敵軍現更以航空母艦先後爲日軍擊沉或被擊毀，故正極謀補充艦隊及航空兵力，更企圖以摩羅泰島方面之敵基地航空兵力，加强對菲律賓之空襲，日機隊則作先發制人之攻擊，粉碎其企圖。</p>
<p>馬尼刺二日中央社電　雷伊泰島日軍守備隊，仍果敢邀擊敵軍，迄三十日判明戰果如下：擊毀巡洋艦，驅逐艦各一艘，擊沉登陸用舟艇百五十艘以上，擊毀十五生砲一門，戰車十數輛，擊落敵機二十餘架，敵軍死傷約三千至四千。</p>
<h3 id="c2">菲律賓方面　美空母調查 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地二日中央社電　據三十一日調查，菲律賓方面敵航空母艦勢力如次：雷伊泰灣內一艘，拉孟灣東方制式一艘，改造者一艘，斯爾安島東方制式一艘，改造者一艘，此外，呂宋島東方三百海里處有敵機動部隊，總計菲律賓現有美國航空母艦六七艘。又敵艦戰機空襲菲律賓狀况如次：二十六日二四三架，二十七日二八三架，二十八日十架，二十九日三六架，三十日無·三十一日無，敵航空母艦戰機之來襲日益减少，由上可見，尤以二十九·三十兩日，日軍神風突擊隊擊沉敵大型空母一艘，擊毀大型空母一艘，擊毀中型小型各一艘，故數日來敵艦戰機來襲之減少，理由可明矣。雷伊泰島，乃決定太平洋運命之戰，不獨日美兩國人士，即世界亦均周知承認，在此戰場扣，美艦戰機之减少理由爲何，抑係以陸地機　代替艦戰機耶，茲誌數日来袭菲律宾之敌陸地机数如次：二十六日八八架，二十七日五五架，二十八日五七架，二十九日十五架，三十日六五架，三十一日五七架。且本月一日日軍偵察塔克羅班，塔拉克兩機場時，無一敵機，由此可知敵空母勢力已爲日軍消耗殆盡美海軍當局曾稱，太洋上擁有空母百艘，其在吉爾貝特·馬紹爾·馬利亞納之作戰動力，艦以空母二三十艘掩護作戰，其何以在雷伊泰島之掩護，竟不足二三十艘耶，此無他，美國空母遭受空前大打擊之鐵證也。</p>

<p>廣西前綫二日中央社電　廣西戰綫日軍各精銳進抵桂林盆地後，即對頑强抵抗之渝第十六集團軍主力之三十一軍加以痛擊，渝軍被壓迫，逐次聚於桂林，擬作最後抵抗，然日軍佔領靈川後，頃已衝至桂林北門，並佔領桂林東方六公里之高地，及進抵東北方三公里之地。各部日軍齊向桂林城郊，展開肉搏戰，與此呼應之另一隊日軍，由東南方進至大圩鎮，遮斷渝軍退路，更由桂林市街進至南方約十五里之機塲附近。故該機塲之陷落已迫眉睫，日軍刻正漸次縮緊包圍圈云。</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社電　據重慶來電，渝軍當局一日夜發表，日軍已突入桂林郊外之北車站。</p>
<p>廣西前線二日中央社電　日軍爲確保興安·承明·桂平·等地，日來由東南北三方整備展開大攻勢。廿九日日軍諸部隊，一致向桂林强壓，桂林東北有東南方之日軍先鋒，　以日進六十餘公里之速度，卅日夜抵達桂林城郊外廓，靠近桂林北面。且突入接近北門之新市街，南門之舊市街，及郊外象鼻山之一角，刻下砲聲正酣，在激戰中。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c10">談效率 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>任何事業須爭取效率，在近代科學昌明機械進步環境之中，無不講求效率，處於今日之決戰階段，尤不可不增進民族之總效率。</p>
<p>民族之總效率產生於各個人之生活及工作，撇開生活無以談民族之效率，不做工作亦無以談民族之效率。但旣生活且又工作，尚須視生活與工作之配合而後能談民族之效率。茲可就四種方式分別言之：</p>
<p>一，爲生活而生活　一切以個人生活爲目的，而生活之慾望復無止境，溫飽之餘希冀舒適，舒適之後更求富麗，顧一已之生活猶不足，又復慮及子孫之生活。於是孜孜矻矻營營茍茍者，其目的在此，雖似乎終日奔忙，工作煩重，但與民族總效率上毫無補益。正以其私慾猖獗，於是不顧廉恥不擇手段，縱使榨取剝削他人之利益在所不惜，損害毀減他人之生機亦在所不顧。故爲生活而生活之結果，足以惡意的減低民族之總效率。</p>
<p>二，爲生活而工作　旣無錢又無勢，毫無憑藉以發展其私慾，或以修養較高雖赤貧亦不願隨波逐流爲人爪牙而分餘潤，則惟有以工作所得以糊其口。然生活所需日無止境，而飢寒交迫冷酷無情，欲使五口之家免於凍餒，則不能一日無工作。至於工作之種類，工作之性質，則晚暇選擇，不論工作之興趣，惟求收入之所得，於是有工必作，而東西奔忙，日夜兼職，縱生活因以維持，然成績幾等於零，甚或在零下。故爲生活而工作之結果，足以自然的減低民族之總效率。</p>
<p>三，爲工作而工作　或以祖先庇蔭，或以投機暴富，揮霍之餘，天良發現，以求利之慾轉爲求名。於是辦慈善事業者有之，辦學校者有之，甚而至於開工廠辦企業者亦有之。然以其所受之敎育有限，再加以紈绔之習染，根本不知各項事業之本質，更不知各項事業之技術，終至旣不能令又不受命，而使事業萎糜，去停頓崩潰者幾希。就恕道之立場而言，能爲工作而工作已無可厚非，然在民族總產效率上觀察之，其結果或可稍有所貢獻，然依事實上之所表現每等於零或竟在零之下。</p>
<p>四，爲工作而生活　旣非赤貧又非暴富，生活安定而不奢侈，起居合理而無憂慮。品有所修技有所長，幼而學壯而行，各就其性之所近而擇定工作之部門爲其終身之事業，以求發揮其本能與天賦，破壞其工作，猶如戕賦其生命。倘各項事業均以此種人才爲中心，以此種精神爲基礎，則日積月累庶幾能有所表現而後能談民族之總效率。</p>
<p>中國號稱人口四萬萬，又復地大物博，所以積弱如此者，蓋爲工作而生活者太少，縱有之亦不足以與其他三種因素相抗衡，民族總效率之低微，豈偶然哉？按民國十年之統計中國每人之效率僅爲歐美四十分之一，經此二十年之演變，每况愈下可無疑義。當今千鈞一髪之秋，其何以改革社會之組織，變更經濟之控制，提高人生之觀念，使多數國民能爲工作而生活，以改善效率而謀民族之生存，願有心人士深長思之。</p>

<p>黃警頑：老人因年齡關係，疾病叢生，而由於營養不良，及缺乏衛生常識，佔大多數，現在特請丁福老講老人營養及衛生問題。</p>
<p>（三）老人的營養及衛生問題</p>
<p>丁福保；本人研究長壽法，發覺世界上古今中外，年過八九十歲以及百齡老人，皆日食二餐，終身蔬食，因肉食者，肉質在腸中腐敗，慢性中毒，尤其老人，消化力薄弱，故蔬食最爲適宜。蔬食中之大豆，含有多量維他命，蛋白質及脂肪，營養豐富，但要細嚼慨曣，多喝開永，最合衛生，宜多實行。其决空氣流通，爲健康所不可忽略，各安老團體，大都數人共居一室，希望多開窗戶，保持新鮮空氣，出外深呼吸，不但裨益健康，且能定心養性，希望老人多多實行，並宜多走路，以代運動。各老人大多深居簡出，足不踰戶，其實是很不好的，希望老人多多利用空間，舒散血脈，以上爲形體上的保健，此外最主要的還有精神上的保健，就是終日怡悅，讓恭受福，奉行八德，則心廣體胖，可臻長壽之境。</p>
<p>範成法師：釋迦牟尼以生老病死爲人生苦厄，今承丁福老就病老二字，鬧發無餘，希望老人遵行勿忘。</p>
<p>楊郁生：老人精神衰老，需要扶助，而靑年人敬老，尤其重要，希望各界對安老與敬老運動切實推行。</p>
<p>方子俊：安老問題，不僅是老人的問題，我們希望除去今日在座諸長老外，普天下的老者壯者少者，都應注意安老問題。同時安老運動，不僅是一兩次座談會或六六敬老節等暫時的討論，而需要將這個印象，永遠銘在人們的心版，所以安老和敬老運動，不論在時間上或對象上，都有推廣的必要。</p>
<p>唐祖祥：安老運動需要切實推行，實事求是，我們今天特別提出辦法，藉資參考，如發動安老助金，安老公墓，免費遊覽公園，舟車優待，飯店優待，醫藥服務，娛樂敬老等等。</p>
<p>趙希明：我以爲救濟老人，應當注意最貧苦無吿的團體及老人。</p>
<p>楊郁生：目前市上有一不良現象，關係老人健康非淺，即各醫院醫師，對小兒疾病，非常歡迎，對老人疾病，郤漠然視之。換言之，小兒科醫師非常興盛，而老人病專家，郤未之見，誠非老人之福。</p>
<p>唐祖祥。希望各醫院，普設免費額或免費床位。</p>
<p>應永玉：可用捐款方法，由興論界鼓吹，籲請各界認捐免費床位若干只，再由各報各院介紹病者入院治療。關於老人團體，本人主張向郊外疏散，庶可减少開支。</p>
<p>唐祖祥：適才各養老堂報告，老人以唸經摺箔爲工作，消極之至，應提倡以積極工作，從事生產，如火柴盒，釘簿等輕便工作，一方面消遣，一方面生產。</p>
<p>楊郁生：總之工作應以有益人羣爲前提。</p>
<p>應永玉：關於老人退休，應提倡養老金制度，一方面可使在職壯年，得以安心盡職，一方面年老員工，不致受生活壓迫，尤以現在物價飛漲，養老金制度，更爲需要。希望各公司廠家及機關，對於年逾六十以上之職工，精力就衰，不宜服務，而有勞績者，予以退職贍養金及退聯贈予金。同時提倡職工儲蓄制度，每月或每年提存，並由各公司當局，加倍存儲，以待職工年老離職時，發給之。除養老金外，安老保險，也是一個有效辦法。</p>
<p>（五）安老運動需有組織</p>
<p>孫翔仲：今日飽諸老宏論，受益匪淺，中心感慨，實非三言二語可包括。第一希望有組織，組織中應包羅各界熱心人士，一方而聽取老人之苦痛及需要，一方面作實際之企劃，有組織才不致散漫，才能生出力量。第二，社會上對敬老運動，還未普遍，且亦未合實際，希望與論界多多提倡，以愛爲原動力，以敬爲歸宿。第三，安老運動，不應有儒釋耶道宗敎之隔閡，同是一事業，不應因辦理者之身分或信仰，而有門戶之見，間接妨害其進展。最後希望於老人自身者，不宜以老自居，甘受供養，而應抖擻精神，領導靑年感格人心，具遠大之懷抱，仁愛之德性，發揮自己之精神力量，感化世人，然後才配稱爲「國老」「世老」「天下之大老」耳。</p>
<p>黃警頭：今日良辰佳節，承諸位指敎多端，於安老運動，貢獻很大，中心銘感，莫可言狀。現請欣賞娛樂節目。（末由國樂研究會代表，在團國秋月下，操古琴名曲，盡歡而散。）（完）</p>

The enemy forces rely on material quantity and are constantly reinforcing, but they have already suffered heavy losses. The number of enemy ships sunk or capsized in Leyte Gulf is increasing daily. The enemy's aircraft carriers have been repeatedly sunk or damaged by the Japanese forces. Therefore, they are desperately seeking to replenish their fleet and air power, and are even attempting to strengthen the air raids on the Philippines with the air power of the enemy bases in the Morotai Island area. The Japanese air units are launching preemptive attacks to crush their attempt.</p>
<p>Manila, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese garrison on Leyte Island is still bravely repelling the enemy forces. The results of the battle up to the 30th are as follows: one cruiser and one destroyer destroyed, over 150 landing craft sunk, one 15-cm gun destroyed, over ten tanks destroyed, over twenty enemy planes shot down, and approximately 3,000 to 4,000 enemy casualties.</p>
<h3 id="e2">American Aircraft Carrier Investigation in the Philippines <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to an investigation on the 31st, the enemy aircraft carrier strength in the Philippines is as follows: one in Leyte Gulf, one standard type and one converted type east of Lamon Bay, one standard type and one converted type east of Siargao Island. In addition, there is an enemy mobile unit 300 nautical miles east of Luzon Island. In total, there are six to seven American aircraft carriers currently in the Philippines. The enemy's aircraft carrier-based air raids on the Philippines are as follows: 243 on the 26th, 283 on the 27th, 10 on the 28th, 36 on the 29th, none on the 30th, and none on the 31st. The number of enemy aircraft carrier-based air raids is decreasing daily. As can be seen from the above, especially on the 29th and 30th, the Japanese kamikaze attack teams sank one large enemy aircraft carrier, damaged one large aircraft carrier, and damaged one medium and one small aircraft carrier. Therefore, the reason for the decrease in enemy aircraft carrier-based air raids in the past few days is clear. The Battle of Leyte Island will determine the fate of the Pacific, which is known and acknowledged by not only the people of Japan and the United States, but also the world. The reason for the decrease in American aircraft carrier-based planes on this battlefield is whether land-based planes are replacing carrier-based planes. The number of enemy land-based planes attacking the Philippines in the past few days is as follows: 88 on the 26th, 55 on the 27th, 57 on the 28th, 15 on the 29th, 65 on the 30th, and 57 on the 31st. Moreover, when Japanese forces scouted the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on the 1st of this month, there were no enemy planes. From this, it can be seen that the enemy's aircraft carrier strength has been almost completely depleted by the Japanese forces. American naval authorities have claimed to have 100 aircraft carriers in the Pacific, and their operational power in the Gilbert, Marshall, and Mariana Islands is to have 20 to 30 aircraft carriers to protect the operations. Why is there less than 20 to 30 aircraft carriers providing protection in Leyte Island? This is nothing more than ironclad proof that American aircraft carriers have suffered an unprecedentedly large blow.</p>

The first unit crossed the Guijiang River on the eastern outskirts of Guilin and reached the North Train Station of the city on the 30th. Its separate detachment also advanced to the northern suburbs, and the fourth unit reached a point 16 kilometers southeast of Guilin. The Japanese army advancing southward along the Xiang-Gui Railway broke into Lingchuan north of Guilin on the evening of the 31st. The left-wing unit of the Japanese army reached a point north of Gongcheng southeast of Guilin.

At this decisive stage, all parties have great expectations for this important conference to strengthen national security.</p>

<h3 id="e10">On Efficiency <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Any undertaking must strive for efficiency. In the modern environment of scientific prosperity and mechanical progress, efficiency is emphasized. In today's decisive stage, it is even more important to increase the overall efficiency of the nation.</p>
<p>The overall efficiency of a nation arises from the lives and work of each individual. There is no way to talk about national efficiency without life, and there is no way to talk about national efficiency without work. However, even with both life and work, it is necessary to consider the coordination of life and work before talking about national efficiency. The following are four ways to discuss this separately:</p>
<p>1.  Living for Life: Everything is aimed at personal life, and the desires of life are endless. After being well-fed and warmly clothed, one hopes for comfort, and after comfort, one seeks wealth and luxury. It is not enough to care for one's own life, but also to worry about the lives of one's children and grandchildren. Therefore, those who are diligent and busy, their purpose is here. Although it seems that they are busy all day long and their work is heavy, it does not help the overall efficiency of the nation. It is precisely because their private desires are rampant that they disregard shame and use any means, even at the expense of exploiting the interests of others and damaging the vitality of others. Therefore, the result of living for life is sufficient to maliciously reduce the overall efficiency of the nation.</p>
<p>2.  Working for Life: With neither money nor power, and no means to develop one's private desires, or with higher moral standards, one is unwilling to follow the crowd and be a pawn for others and share the profits. Then one has no choice but to use the income from work to feed oneself. However, the needs of life are endless, and hunger and cold are ruthless. To keep a family of five from freezing and starving, one cannot go a day without work. As for the type of work and the nature of the work, one has no time to choose. Regardless of the interest in the work, one only seeks the income. Therefore, one will do any work, and one will rush around east and west, working day and night. Even if life is maintained as a result, the results are almost equal to zero, or even below zero. Therefore, the result of working for life is sufficient to naturally reduce the overall efficiency of the nation.</p>
<p>3.  Working for Work: Either with the blessing of ancestors, or with sudden wealth through speculation, after squandering, one's conscience is discovered, and the desire for profit is transformed into a desire for fame. Therefore, some run charitable organizations, some run schools, and even some open factories and run businesses. However, because their education is limited, and they are infected with the habits of a dandy, they do not know the essence of various undertakings, let alone the technology of various undertakings. In the end, they are neither able to give orders nor receive orders, and the undertakings wither, and those that stagnate and collapse are rare. From the standpoint of forgiveness, there is nothing wrong with being able to work for work. However, from the perspective of national total productivity, the results may be able to make a slight contribution, but in reality, they are often equal to zero or even below zero.</p>
<p>4.  Living for Work: Neither extremely poor nor suddenly wealthy, life is stable and not extravagant, and living is reasonable and without worries. With cultivated character and skilled skills, one learns in youth and acts in adulthood, each choosing the department of work that is closest to their nature as their lifelong career, in order to give full play to their abilities and talents. To damage their work is like harming their life. If all undertakings are centered on this kind of talent and based on this kind of spirit, then with daily accumulation, one can gradually make some achievements and then talk about the overall efficiency of the nation.</p>
<p>China is known as a nation of 400 million people, and it is also vast in land and rich in resources. The reason why it is so weak is that there are too few people who live for work. Even if there are some, they are not enough to counter the other three factors. Is the low overall efficiency of the nation accidental? According to statistics from the tenth year of the Republic of China, the efficiency of each person in China was only one-fortieth of that of Europe and the United States. After twenty years of evolution, it is undoubtedly getting worse. In this critical moment, how to reform the organization of society, change the control of the economy, and improve the concept of life, so that the majority of the people can live for work, so as to improve efficiency and seek the survival of the nation, I hope that people with good intentions will think deeply about it.</p>

The attack on Maldusek on Tuesday was repelled. The German counterattack in Serok a few days ago has defeated the Soviet army.

The Soviet army's attack has now been blocked by the German counterattack.</p>

<p>The Administrative Office of the Municipal Police Bureau is investigating the operation, storage, or disposal of dangerous goods such as explosives, gunpowder, and flammable liquids, which pose a risk to the property of individuals and the public. For the sake of public safety and special prevention, it is urgently necessary to manage them meticulously. In the past, the Public Works Bureau and the First District Public Office required that the storage or disposal of the aforementioned dangerous goods be submitted for approval and licensing before the relevant business could be carried out. However, in the meantime, due to changes in administrative areas or administrative organizational changes, the request for approval has not been comprehensive. Therefore, in view of the importance of dangerous goods to public safety, a detailed investigation should be conducted first for those who operate, store, or dispose of dangerous goods, as well as non-operators who exceed a certain amount for personal or family use, in order to prepare and manage relevant necessary preventive measures. Therefore, investigation forms have been issued, ordering each branch bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and report to the bureau for approval within ten days. The investigation form must specify the name of the person in charge, location, quantity, equipment, and other details.</p>

<p>The Municipal Pao-Chia Committee reduced the monthly Pao-Chia donation by half from July according to the original regulations. In order to actively plan and strengthen the self-defense corps, a large amount of funds is required. The County and Suburban District Pao-Chia Administrative Conference of the committee decided that the original regulations would be restored from the first day of this month (November). Factories will be charged 100 yuan per month, shops 50 yuan per month, regular households 30 yuan per month, and attached households 20 yuan per month. It is reported that the order has been sent to the subordinates for strict compliance.</p>
<p>After the Pao-Chia Office of the Municipal Police Bureau began to uniformly collect the Pao-Chia expenses of the various districts under its jurisdiction in July of this year, it specifically notified the general joint Bao of each district under its jurisdiction regarding the expenses of foreign Pao-Chia that foreign Pao-Chia expenses will be temporarily suspended until the foreign Pao-Chia organization is completed.</p>

<p>In order to carry out the final decisive transport and to facilitate passengers, the Central China Railway will restore the night train on the Beijing-Shanghai line and the ordinary train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, which were previously suspended, limited to November 6. The night train on the Beijing-Shanghai line is for all classes of cars. Central China and North China will be able to take the train together. The fifth train in the afternoon will depart from Shanghai at 22:05 and arrive in Nanjing at 7:00 AM the next day. If you directly cross the Yangtze River, you may be able to transfer to the express train to Beijing that departs at 9:00 AM. The southbound train will arrive in Pukou from Beijing at 19:20. If you take the sixth military train departing from Nanjing at 23:00, you will arrive in Shanghai at 7:50 AM the next morning. On the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, only the train that runs between Shanghai and Hangzhou in the morning is in operation. Therefore, it is too crowded. Therefore, a round trip will be added to the train departing from Shanghai at 15:40 and arriving in Hangzhou at 21:55, and the train departing from Hangzhou at 16:30 and arriving in Shanghai at 22:25. Therefore, it is possible to arrive in Shanghai from Jinhua on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line in one day, and it is also possible to transfer to another train.

<h3 id="e34">Elderly Care Issues: Symposium (2) <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Huang Jingwan: The elderly suffer from many diseases due to age, and most of them are due to malnutrition and lack of hygiene knowledge. Now, we especially invite Ding Fulao to talk about the nutrition and hygiene of the elderly.</p>
<p>(3) Nutrition and Hygiene of the Elderly</p>
<p>Ding Fubao: I have been studying longevity methods and found that the elderly over 80 or 90 years old and centenarians, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign, all eat two meals a day and are vegetarians throughout their lives. This is because meat eaters' meat rots in the intestines, causing chronic poisoning, especially in the elderly, whose digestive power is weak, so vegetarian food is most suitable. Soybeans in vegetarian food contain a large amount of vitamins, protein, and fat, and are rich in nutrition, but they should be chewed carefully and swallowed slowly, and drinking more boiled water is most hygienic and should be practiced more. Good air circulation is indispensable for health. Most elderly care organizations have several people living in the same room, so I hope they will open more windows to keep the air fresh, and take deep breaths outside, which will not only benefit health but also calm the mind and cultivate nature. I hope the elderly will practice more, and also walk more to replace exercise. Most elderly people live in seclusion and rarely go out, which is actually very bad. I hope the elderly will make more use of space to relax their blood vessels. The above is physical health care. In addition, the most important thing is mental health care, which is to be happy all day long, accept blessings with respect, and practice the eight virtues, then the mind will be broad and the body will be healthy, and one can reach the realm of longevity.</p>
<p>Master Fan Cheng: Sakyamuni regarded birth, old age, sickness, and death as the sufferings of life. Now, I am grateful to Ding Fulao for his thorough explanation of the words sickness and old age, and I hope the elderly will follow and not forget them.</p>
<p>Yang Yusheng: The elderly are mentally frail and need support, and it is especially important for young people to respect the elderly. I hope all sectors will earnestly promote the elderly care and respect for the elderly movement.</p>
<p>Fang Zijun: The issue of elderly care is not only an issue for the elderly. We hope that in addition to the elders present today, the elderly, strong, and young people all over the world should pay attention to the issue of elderly care. At the same time, the elderly care movement is not just a temporary discussion at one or two symposiums or the Sixth Sixth Respect for the Elderly Festival, but needs to have this impression permanently engraved in people's minds. Therefore, the elderly care and respect for the elderly movement needs to be promoted in terms of both time and object.</p>
<p>Tang Zuxiang: The elderly care movement needs to be earnestly promoted and be practical. We are presenting specific methods today for reference, such as launching elderly care assistance funds, elderly care cemeteries, free park tours, preferential treatment for boats and vehicles, preferential treatment for hotels, medical services, and entertainment for the elderly.</p>
<p>Zhao Ximing: I think that when providing relief to the elderly, we should pay attention to the poorest and most helpless groups and elderly people.</p>
<p>Yang Yusheng: There is currently a bad phenomenon in the market that is closely related to the health of the elderly, that is, doctors in various hospitals are very welcoming to children's diseases, but they are indifferent to elderly diseases. In other words, pediatricians are very prosperous, but elderly disease experts are not seen, which is really not a blessing for the elderly.</p>
<p>Tang Zuxiang: I hope that all hospitals will universally set up free quotas or free beds.</p>
<p>Ying Yongyu: Donations can be used to promote the idea by opinion leaders, appealing to all sectors to recognize and donate a certain number of free beds, and then various newspapers and hospitals will introduce patients for treatment. Regarding elderly groups, I advocate dispersing them to the suburbs, which can reduce expenses.</p>
<p>Tang Zuxiang: As reported by the various nursing homes just now, the elderly are working by chanting scriptures and folding foil, which is extremely passive. We should promote active work and engage in production, such as light work like matchboxes and stapling notebooks, on the one hand to pass the time, and on the other hand to produce.</p>
<p>Yang Yusheng: In short, the work should be based on benefiting the crowd.</p>
<p>Ying Yongyu: Regarding the retirement of the elderly, we should promote the old-age pension system. On the one hand, it can allow young people in the workforce to work with peace of mind, and on the other hand, elderly employees will not be subjected to living pressure. Especially with the current soaring prices, the old-age pension system is even more needed. I hope that various companies, factories, and organizations will provide retirement pensions and retirement gifts to employees over 60 years of age who are weak in energy and not suitable for service, but have meritorious service. At the same time, promote the employee savings system, with monthly or annual deposits, and the company authorities will double the deposits, to be paid to employees when they leave the job due to old age. In addition to old-age pensions, elderly care insurance is also an effective method.</p>
<p>(5) The Elderly Care Movement Needs Organization</p>
<p>Sun Xiangzhong: I have benefited a lot from the broad opinions of the elders today. The central emotion is really not something that can be covered in a few words. First, I hope there will be an organization. The organization should include enthusiastic people from all walks of life, on the one hand to listen to the suffering and needs of the elderly, and on the other hand to make practical plans. Only with organization can it not be scattered, and only then can it produce strength. Second, the society's respect for the elderly movement is not yet universal, and it is also not in line with reality. I hope that public opinion will promote it more, with love as the driving force and respect as the destination. Third, the elderly care movement should not have the religious barriers of Confucianism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Taoism. It is the same career, and it should not have门户之见 due to the identity or beliefs of the organizers, indirectly hindering its progress. Finally, I hope that the elderly themselves should not regard themselves as old, accept offerings willingly, but should cheer up, lead young people to inspire people's hearts, have great ambitions, and virtues of benevolence and love, and exert their spiritual power to influence the world, and then they are worthy of being called "national elders", "world elders", and "great elders of the world."</p>
<p>Huang Jingtou: On this good day, thank you for your guidance and great contributions to the elderly care movement. The central gratitude is indescribable. Now, please enjoy the entertainment program. (Finally, the representative of the National Music Research Association played a famous Guqin song under the group Guo Qiuyue, and everyone dispersed happily.) (End)</p>
