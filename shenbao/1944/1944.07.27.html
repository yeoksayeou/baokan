<h3 id="c1">談歐局 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>問：這幾天各界的視線又由日本內閣改組問題，轉向於歐州問題了。而且還有不少人，因歐洲時局而推想到東亞局勢，未知尊意如何？</p>
<p>答：目前歐洲的形勢，和東亞時局，完全為兩件事，不能倂為一談，至於因歐局而析杞憂，更不免有庸人自擾之議吧！</p>
<p>問：歐州時局的近情如何？</p>
<p>答：歐洲時局，大家最注目的似乎還是德元首希特勒遇刺問題。其實這件事業已明日黃元，憶無待猜測，依照各方面的報導，以及希特勒元首的廣播演詞，可知　行兇人犯，只是德國若干非現役的將校，與德國作虞指導部無關，對於士氣及民心並無影響。　現在德國政府已任命戈林爲最高軍事代表，希墨萊爲國內防衛軍統帥，國防力可益臻强化。</p>
<p>問：然則歐洲戰局的趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：歐洲戰局的前途，不取決於德國內精，重要的關鍵，在乎下列二者：　東綫，　北法，　巴爾幹。關於東界綫的戰局，自英美侵歐登陸戰開闢以來，蘇聯即乘機發動大規模的夏季攻勢，戰况劇烈。但是北部芬蘇前錢，蘇軍占取維堡後即毫無進展。南部烏克蘭羅馬尼亞前綫的紅軍，亦徘徊於喀爾巴阡山麓，一籌莫展。只有中部「波羅的海沿岸」三軍及「白俄羅斯」三軍，較有推進，北路巳逼近東普魯士國境，南路亦侵入舊波蘭而有威脅波京華沙的趨勢。然而這一方面的德軍，都已按照預定計劃，予蘇軍以打擊，然後從容突團，蘇軍包圍殲滅的計劃，並未完全成功。</p>
<p>至於北法方面，美英攻部隊雖多，然而侵占地域，至今未有超出一百公里者，其所以未能如東綫之猛進，一由於德軍之堅強的防術力及巧妙的戰術，二由於英美軍士無鬥志。</p>
<p>此外義大利戰綫，反軸心軍亦無重大進展，即早爲眾所矚目之巴爾幹半烏，迄今整個形勢仍有利於軸心同盟國。</p>
<p>問：美英蘇聯間的關係有何新發展？</p>
<p>答：從整個世界戰局觀，英美迄今仍處於不利的地位，這是彰彰明甚的事實。所以英美在戰略上，不得不受制於蘇聯。然而蘇聯在歐洲及巴爾幹方面軍事和政治的勢力日趨擴張，則英美對蘇的欵忌反感也日益增加。這也是不容忽視的事實。因此，我們可以推想到：　今後英美蘇在攻歐戰略上的矛盾，必將日益尖銳化；　今後英美蘇對歐洲各流亡政權的外交戰將日形激烈；　今後英美蘇由戰略到政略的衝突，仍不可免。</p>
<p>問：反軸心國對東亞的動態如何？</p>
<p>答：反軸心對歐洲的矛盾，目前尚因戰局嚴重而未遽袋面化，可是，對東亞政策的矛盾，是非常公開的，去年蘇聯爲日蘇中立協定而拒不參加羅邱蔣開羅會議，今年日蘇又有新協定宣告成立，即可見蘇聯決不願為英美所利用而為共在東亞的爪牙。這一事實，對於日本北疆之安全，具有極大的作用。同時，英美也因此在東亞是孤立的，加以在此歐局日趨嚴運之際，英美都巳爲歐戰而痛感精疲功書之苦，他們所以向塞班島大宮島冒險侵攻，正是他們在精疲力盡之際內心煩躁的表現而已。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日舉行定例閣議　檢討現戰局措置　决定明处度預算編造方針 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電日木二十五日之定例閣議，上午九時在宮內舉行，小磯首相等閣僚全體出席，由軍方報告戰况，中午零時十五分，全體在首相官邸進午餐，一時十分繼續開會，由重米外相說明最近歐洲情勢，旋議決關於藏相所提明年度預算編造方針後，懇談目前各問題，下午三時七分散會。又新內閣連日協議關於應付重大戰局之國內態勢强化事件，幷於二十五日定例閣議中，就當前戰局之措置問題，閣員問交換意見，今後更將作具體之檢討。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日本明年度預算編造造方針，經石渡藏相與大藏省務當局磋商結果，現已準備完畢，二十五日經由定例閣議正式決定，二十五日下午三時由情報局正式發表。按新預算之編造，乃基於小幾·米內內閣之發軍國家總力方針，其要點如下：國家總力參戰，發揮全智全能力，以實踐忍苦耐勞，强化必勝不敗體勢爲最要目的。在預算編成及實行上，均採取機動性編造方針，以應付戰局，對急轉或空襲及其他不測事件，嚴密審慎國家資金，物資動貝，勞務動員計劃，預算飛機增產及其他應急施策。基於上項方針，各省之新預算一概不予承認，僅按概定經費推行，概定經費外，以預算費作臨時之支出，因之過去數年來蹈襲之預算統制大綱及列議計劃方式等，完全廢止。因情勢之變化，應行事項，由閣議或由官會議決定，此種機動的預算方式，頗堪注目。</p>
<h3 id="c3">國防會議例會通過　鄕村建設計劃大綱 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　今（廿六）日國防會議舉行第五十二次會議，宣讀上次會議紀錄後，開始討論，茲摘錄決議要案如左：</p>
<p>主席父議，據行政時轉據財政部呈，爲編具卅三年度下半年國家收支總概算書，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過。　主席交議，據行政院呈，爲本時第二一六次會議，通過修正公務員特種保險暫行條例第九絛及第十二條條文一案，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，決議通過。　主席交議，據全國經濟審員會呈，爲建設鄉村，經擬具計劃大綱，由關係部會長官簽其審查意見，暨鄉村建設實施委員會組織條例，呈請鑒核等情，請公決案，泱議通過，原計劃大綱交經委會參考。</p>
<p>主席交議，秘書處案呈，准國民政府文官處函，爲國民政府宴請東亞醫學會會員臨時費四萬三千九百四十七元四角，業經遵諭將支付帳據先送審計部審核。茲准該部函復，上項臨時費已依法審核，尙無不合等由，請轉陳鑒核追認飭據等情，請公決案，決議通過。　主席交議，秘書處案呈，准國民政府參軍處函，爲本處經辦卅三年元彈慶典臨時費一萬九千八百五十七元，業經連諭將支付帳據，先送審計部審核。茲准訪部函復，上項臨時費已依法審核，尚無不合等等由，請轉陳鑒核追認飭撥等情，請公決案，決議通過。於人事任免，主席交護，　華北政委會幫務委。兼敎育總署督辦王談呈辭本兼各職，應予照准，特任王克艘兼敎育總署督辦。　特派孫育才爲新運會委員。</p>
<p>南京廿六日中央社一電　事變以還，農村衰敗已極，幾無建設之可哲。其衰敗原因，雖有多端，主要者不外農們治安不良，地方行政不健全，農產品之價格運輸諸問體，未能謀得合理解決，以是生產減少，農民生活頓陷苦境，影嚮所及，使社會經濟動盪不定，行政力量，無從發揮。全國經濟委員會，爲針對病態，諜求改善，特擬具鄉村建設計劃大綱，交由國防會前修正通過，並擬短期內組織鄉村建設實施委員會，以負責推動該項計劃，各方對此極爲重視。因鄉村之普遍建設，實爲我國生存發達之張本，而該計劃大綱之確立，則爲建設農村之初次工作。同時值此決戰期間，物資缺乏之現象，可以由於鄉村建設之成功，使生產增加，物資供應趨於圓滑，不僅可以安定民生，確保軍需，且可進而貢猷於大東亞戰爭，以分担建設東亞之重大責任</p>
<h3 id="c4">鄕村建設　計劃大綱 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電鄉村建設計劃大綢：　宗旨　我國民政府本年度施政重點爲「肅正思想，確保治安，增加生產」，此三者，本互相表裏，須合爲一體，使其同時並進。至着就輕重緩急程序言之，則應着重於增產……原因之最著者，約有下列六端：　農村治安不良。　各種武力團體對農民之苛索。　農產物價格採購方法及運銷上諸缺點。　地方行政上之諸多不備。　農民敎育之不澈底，及農民之無組織。　農業技術指導機關，與經濟助成機關之不振不備。現在欲革除此等原因，須從建設鄉村始。惟從事鄉村建設，始可以健全農村組織，建立一般田業發達，進而更可以關整都市與農村關係，培養民族社會實力，發揚文公，藉以確保中國今後之飛躍發展。中國目下最感痛苦者，乃物價之飛躍上漲，食糧生產之不足，廉潔政治之未能澈底施行，稅制之改革未臻妥善，和平統一未克早實現，現有軍隊將來如何使其解甲歸農，皆須俟鄉村建設普遍區域推廣，而後始可得到具有恒久性之根本解決。蓋欲澈底抑平物價，及減少食糧不足之病，須生產增大，生產物交流確保後。而始可勵行廉潔政治，實大有待於地方武力，及行政力之全般刷新。故改革稅制，須決先由購現物課稅雜稅等之整頓，故促成和平統一，實有賴於我國民政府統治下施行善政，用以增進其他地區民衆及其指導者，對我國民政府信賴，毅然自拔來歸。欲使軍隊解甲歸農，須確保鄕村治安。質言之，以上種重，均須俟鄉村建設設早底於成，而始可以逐一具體實現。且我國民政府行政力，及其參戰理念等，亦皆須力謀鄉村建設，而後始可滲透於中國民衆之間，此爲毫無疑義者。　實施要領按照我國目前形勢以及經濟發展階段，鄉村建設應以縣爲基本單位。省與中央負計劃調整及指導督促之責，分述於後：第一，選定寶騐縣，在攤村建設之經騐及指導力尚未成熟之先，應於三省一市各選定一縣爲實騐縣，使各方面之指導力，集中於此。根據實騐所得結果，而後逐漸改善，並漸次擴大。實騐縣區，甲，實騐縣選定之標準，選定實騐縣時，應特別注意左列諸點：　治安比較良好之處。　交通不特別感覺不便之處。　縣長對於鄉村建設事業有充份理解及熱意，且須廉潔者。　於農村靑年集團訓練之設施，能有獲得宿會農塲希望之處。　可能範國內，須合作社發達至相當程度之處，（乙）實騐縣之選定與縣長之任命，實騐縣之選定與實騐縣縣長之任命，由各省與中央政府主管部事先協議決定之，其任期爲三年。在任期中，如無特別重大過失不得免職，對治績卓越者，並得連任或特予奪將。（丙）實騐縣之督導，實騐縣之指導督勵，其第一次由省政府負責辦理之，中央政府得全省政府或與省政府協力實行指導督勵事務，同時企劃關於建設車業全般之述絡發展，並撥付相當補，助金由省政府轉發實騐縣。（丁）實騐縣之亞備，在實騐縣成立之先，由中央招集之各該縣縣長及幹部職員，實施關於鄉村建設及實騐縣建營理念，及方法之講習訓練。（未完）</p>

<p>中國戰綫某基地二十六日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，四日深夜更奇襲零陵機塲，擊破渝機六（架外，有兩架及其機塲倉庫等七處，中彈起火。按是日日轟炸機隊于暗夜中，飛担零陵上空，在渝軍猛烈之防空砲火中，作果敢之俯衝轟炸，即有小型機十八架以上，中彈燃燒，七處軍事設施亦遭痛炸。其滑走路已一時不能使用，渝美空軍企岡出動於衡陽戰塲，而由桂林遺來之此十數架飛機，已全被日機粉碎云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　美聯社專慶特派員二十五日訊，湖南戰况如次：湖南戰錢日軍已逐漸壓縮對衡陽之包圍網，前來救援之渝軍，現尚未能突破日軍之包圍錢，故此繼續將及一月之衡陽戰鬥，現已漸至最後關頭，如果日軍攻陷衡陽，則重慶軍於該市東南之突出點，即將被却除，然後對現尚殘存於渝軍掌中之粵漢錢二百七十公里區間之攻擊，亦勢必開始。又該特派員對淒慘之衡陽作戰，曾叙述如次：據前綫消息，自六月二十五日以來之一月間，日軍為殲滅被包圍中之衡陽渝軍，曾集中砲擊，幷突入舊街市外側之新街市，更兩次突破城壁，突入舊街市內。渝軍於一個月中僅有兩次於西門城區突破包圍，被時曾與西方之救援部隊取得連絡。但至七月十日，已再度被日軍包圍。衡陽渝軍持有三月之食糧，其他武器彈藥及醫療品，亦得賴飛機補給云。</p>
<h3 id="c6">社福部招待　首都記者團 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　壯會福利部於二十六日十五時，假南京聯歡社，招待首都中外記者，答覆記者問，茲誌如次：關於上海遊民勞動營籌備，現在進一步工作爲整頓第二步籌辦，經籌備會決定開辦費爲三千萬元，此項費用不擬向國府請求撥給，現僅有一千萬元業已確定，尚少二千萬元，擬在滬籌募，故開辦費可不成問題。現在預算先行假定收容一千名遊民，至勞動工作將以培殖農業爲主體。關於淮南煤礦公司生產工作，因工人數量太少，爲調整該公司工人數量起見，擬在江淮各地區設立勞工招募處負責招募工人。關於南京勞動服務工作狀况，南京國民義務勞動，第一項工作爲淸除市區內垃圾，確保市內淸潔，將來遂步推進。自六月十五日開始以來，迄七月十五日止，業已大部完成。在八月十四日左右，該兩區可以全部完成。</p>

<p>南京江十六日中央社電　華中鐵道前以旅客往來衆多，跑單幫者無處不有，而每日車票發售數量有限，致與交通運輸實際不敷遠甚。於是有不肖之徒，搶買車票，轉手黑市，每有超過車票三四倍者。其於正當旅客之交通影饗至鉅。刻有關當局會通令禁止，惟迄今此種現象，仍未能根絕。及華鐵公司內少數不良職員，利用職務便利，發售黑禁，此不僅於華鐵公司當局之令饗有關，且將影嚮正當旅客之交通，故望華鐵公司當局，速予整頓。同時建設部當局亦應切實負起督導賣任，務使此種不良現象，根本剷除。</p>

<p>東京二十六日中央社電　迭尼安島詳細戰况如次：美軍奪取塞班島後，不斷對該方面日軍基地加強海陸雙方之攻擊，並暴露其在大宮島及迭尼安島登陸之企岡，二十日終於由兩處在大宮島登陸，對於迭尼安島則逐漸增加空襲次數，並調遣强力之機動部隊，接近該島，反覆施行猛烈砲擎，於是該島一帶之戰事驟然激化。二十二日下午，美軍登陸般，曾在該島西南部迭尼安港外從事偵察。二十三日晨，出動戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦等約十艘，向該島進發，企圖在熾烈之砲火掩護下，於迭尼安港及該島西北部登陸，當地日軍部隊奮勇迎擊，毀其戰艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，予以莫大損害，而將其擊退。對自西北方來製之美軍，曾兩度於水際將其擊退，但美軍增強兵力，併力攻擊，終於是日登陸，刻日軍部隊沉着迎擊，並施行夜襲，正激烈奮戰中。</p>

<p>— 菱秋</p>
<p>占據塞班島的美海軍，在信口自誇了。他們宣傳道，以美海軍在中國大陸登陸，進迫日本本土，有如反掌之易。但拿英美自大柬亞戰爭以來失敗的地方，與現在收復的地方比較起來，現在的情况，僅如九牛之於一毛。以此就能够侈言海軍作戰已迫近勝利嗎？這不過是在大東亞戰爭的緒戰中，受日海軍先制攻擊的零落殘缺的艦隊之重建而已。不足驚異。這狀能在開戰前已經知道了。</p>
<p>島嶼歟？軍艦歟？</p>
<p>德國的戰爭論者克勞塞維曾說，因戰爭為遂行國策的一手段，故為戰爭之一分子的武力戰之目的；「乃誘致使敵國人民考慮媾和比繼續戰爭為有利的狀態」。是以海軍作戰的目的，乃在扼制地球上最大，最廣的交通路綫——海洋；管至並支配海洋上的交通聯絡，在敵國的政治，軍事，經濟，思想上給與致命的打擊，而毀滅其機能。那制海機的獲得，是海軍作戰的主要目的。</p>
<p>故如美海軍所誇稱：占據塞班島在海軍作戰上獲得決定的勝利，如果有人相信這話，那眞是可笑的誤解。占據一島嶼，其結果推進了艦隊並飛機的基地。是以無論占據那一個島嶼，也就是獲得了附近二三千公里的制海權。但假使日本艦隊出動，驅除美艦隊，再奪還島嶼，則這制海權即成泡影，每將尼米資亦確認：「日本艦隊尙完會健在」，在此情形下，如何能以塞班島的奪取誇傳為海軍作戰的勝利呢？</p>
<p>為獲取治海權，雜持制海權的必要方法與手段，除擊滅敵主力艦隊以外，別無他道。</p>
<p>機動歟？決戰歟？</p>
<p>海軍作戰主要目的的敵主力艦隊之擊滅，談何容易。這不單在此次戰爭中，即在日俄戰爭中亦然。例如那有名的明治三十七年二月的一役中，對敵遠東艦隊的根據地旅順港，雖施以夜襲，砲擊，封鎖，機雷攻擊，並繼之以封鎖港口，用盡種種方法，尚不能使敵艦隊潰滅，尤以八月十日，曾在洋上邀擊大舉出擊的敵遠東艦隊，而擊破之，而獲致黃海戰的捷報，但靠這補助作戰中的勝利，尙不能確保眞正的制海權。直待擊破從波羅的海遠涉重洋而來的俄國主力艦隊以後，日本始能確保勝利。</p>
<p>在這中間，日本的第二艦隊司令長官上村中將的鄕居，遭遇投石事件，為國民的不理解所苦。</p>
<p>對於海軍作戰上補助作戰的動向而乍憂乍喜，不是笨事。敵人進迫塞班島，如其能夠利用這良機而實施艦的漸減作戰，自日佳事。日本亦稱之為出血戰術，果能漸次造成敵艦隊的潰滅，可說充分完成了補助作戰的目的。</p>
<p>決戰否耶？</p>
<p>以大東亞戰爭與日俄戰爭比較起來，在海軍作戰上。在下面諸點有非常的不同。</p>
<p>第一是戰塲的廣大。日俄戰爭中海軍作戰的主要戰塲僅限於黃海及日本海。然大東亞戰爭則在世界最大的海軍太平洋及印度軍的大半，各方面滿佈着戰略的要域，海軍兵力亦分散配置於各方面，結果，欲獲得傾雙方兵力以舉行主力艦隊決戰的機會，非常困難。</p>
<p>第二，由於飛機，潛水艦，電波探知器等近代武器的發達，海上作戰的性質變化了。日俄戰爭時代，祗使用水上艦艇的海戰，現在加上了空中戰，永中戰，變成立造化了。其結果，因飛楊利用其速度，在艦隊進入決戰以前即得以襲擊敵艦隊，故眞正的艦隊決戰轉形困難。又由於電波探知機的出現，艦隊行動從遠在數萬里之外，亦能獲悉，故知道視綫外敵艦隊的動態而不利於決戰的艦隊，事先即能迴避，故艦隊決戰愈益成為不可能。</p>
<p>第三，美國與日俄戰爭時的俄國不同，在政治，經濟·思想上亦無致命的動搖，並無希求早日決戰以挽救反戰，厭戰思想的橫行並國內不安的深刻化之情事。故艦隊決戰不能迅即實現。</p>
<p>機動戰是什麽？</p>
<p>但這裏所應注意者，即美海軍的動向，己表面化了。那就是今春以來美海軍的機動作戰。例如，美海軍何故敢於深入日本海軍內綫，在塞班島並大宮島（關島）實行登陸戰呢？此在一方面，美政府當局因欲在大選之有，以好虞思想給與動搖中的美國國民，而謀戰局之有利的展開，焦慮之狀，無可掩飾。而在加一方面，我們必須想到樹立美海軍基本戰略的史漢少將之夢。</p>
<p>據馬漢戰術：「如欲常握制海權，應保持局地的優勢，常以攻擊臨敵。」用戰艦十餘艘，航空母艦二十餘艘等，組成第五十八機動部隊，進迫塞班島一孤島，他們的企圖，也就是追求那史漢的夢。史漢而說：「要擊破敵艦隊而確保制海權，應衝襲敵所發急要的地方，使敵艦隊陷於非救援不可的狀態，而邀擊之於目己所希望的洋上。」</p>
<p>美艦隊以為塞班島是臼本所最急要的地方，一面加以急要，同時，另一方面即欲邀擊日本艦隊的出動，整備自已所最希望態勢，而嚴陣以待。對此，晶本聯合艦隊僅令其一部出擊，由飛機發動先制攻擊，獲得偉大戰果，而使漸减作戰成功，同時，使史漢的夢成為泡影。</p>
<p>當然，這是美國海軍當局的誤解，以為沒有大型機塲，也沒有充分軍港設備的塞班島一孤島是日本的要地，以致此，然日本海軍慎重地向最後勝利邁進的戰略之優秀性，亦不能不加贊佩。</p>
<p>但關於大宮島如何？對此疑問，擬暫守沈　，留待讀者考慮。</p>
<p>決戰條件是什麽？</p>
<p>綜上所論，可以歸納為二個問題，即日本艦隊容忍美機動間隊蠢動到什麼地步，在那裹決戰？</p>
<p>這裏不能不想到，與陸軍作戰一樣，在海軍作戰上，地形亦為重要的要素。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰之先，德國為推進其世界政策而努力建造強大的艦隊時，當時的英海軍大臣邱吉爾嘲笑謂：「僅以你們的海軍艦隊，尚不能稱為海軍力。你們的世界政策，等於立在粘土之上」。果然，德國海軍在第一次世界戰爭中，向主要戰塲大西洋的出擊被阻，僅能在次要的戰塲北海及波羅的海活動。這是德國專顧整頓艦隊，而忘卻了海上權力的另一要素戰略地形的結果。地形在海上作戰中是如此的重要。</p>
<p>所謂戰略的地形者，在海軍作戰上意義是什麽呢？</p>
<p>第一，有着適當的海軍根據地之聯繫。美海軍不直接從夏威夷進迫塞班島，而費了很大的犧牲占據瑪金·達拉瓦等小島者，其原因可說在獲得海軍根據地，占據塞班島亦可視為建設海軍根據地。</p>
<p>第二，我必須在內綫，而使敵人在外綫。在必要的地點，必要的時候，常能集中優勢兵力，作先制攻擊，便有勝算的把握。</p>
<p>且內綫作戰因後方聯絡運輸路綫短捷，故有安全而迅速之利。日軍的從瓜達爾加納爾島轉進，德軍的從莫斯科縮短戰綫的重大原因，也因為伸得過長的補給綫之故。</p>
<p>如上所述，何國的海軍占得內綫的優勢，何國的海軍為維持過長的補給綫而苦惱，請攤開地圖來研究一下。美第五十八機動部隊宣稱能離開基地繼續作戰行動達數屋期之久。但研究太平洋上的往來的距離，顯出在作戰上受着很大的限制。但再說下去，屬於戰略上的機密，決完日美二國之興廢的艦隊決戰塲，何處對日有利，不能明示。這事甚至於也可說是有關大東亞十億人民的將夾，請諸君自行想像吧！</p>
<p>尤其在飛機發達的今日，能够使從陸上基地飛來，大型而航續時間悠久，搭載大量炸彈的飛機參加海戰，是最好的條件。漢視此條件，不能考慮艦隊決戰。關於此點，美軍當局會稱：航空母艦有移動性，攻擊性，是優秀的。</p>
<p>但航空母艦的搭載量大型的約百架，小型的僅數十架，如再遇日本空軍神技般的俯衝雷擊，轉瞬即告擊沉。故美海軍的話，不過是欲據艦被日本占領許多島嶼的美海軍之弱態的宣傳上言辭。</p>
<p>來到何處？</p>
<p>佔據塞班島的美將尼米資曾聲稱，因日本艦隊今尙建在，故預料今後尙須經數次激戰，但猶誇口證以美海軍力北上進迫日本本土，或西下登陸中國大陸，均易如反掌。但實際上，旣不北上，又不西下，反自二十一日以來在天宮島再度展開登陸戰。由此不難想像，寒班島之戰略的地位，出乎他們的預料，是怎樣的　小，又向馬利亞納羣島以外的作戰，是怎樣的困難。這裏說明了美軍方面伸展的補給綫之不鞏固。但這裹不能不注意者，內綫陣營的日本，雖說有着確守制海權的海域，但時間上，空間上，亦不能斷言美海軍的通過是不可能的。</p>
<p>制海權者，不是在海上築有金城湯池之鐵壁。亦不是用堅固的鐵鐀設定勢力範圍，不使敵人走近一步。戰塲是沒有山，沒有谷，沒有河，沒有路的廣漢的大六，其勢力範圍最多不過不容適自由活動的程度而已。是以其效果亦不是絕對不動的，而是在時間上，空間上不免有多少動搖的相對的東西。這與制空權相似。上海上空完全在日本的制空權下，是絕對不答敵機自由亂飛的地方。但要說不容有一機侵八，這在天空的性質上，飛機的性能上，是不可能的。</p>
<p>故美軍縱占據塞班島，登陸大宮島，轟炸小笠原島及硫黃島，報復不是絕對不可能的。祗要日本海軍今尚完全健全，確信勝利是關於日本的，那東亞民族的</p>
<p>美軍將進攻何處呢？美軍進攻到何處時，日本艦隊始出動挑戰吸？此尙不明，國父孫中山先生在關於大亞細亞的講演中曾指示：「如亞細亞九億居民一致團結結來應付，決不會敗於歐洲四億的少數人」</p>

<p>督察處姚處長答：警士如有違章行為，自當嚴懲不貸，所望市民共同監視，隨時將發生之事實時間地點及記明警察號碼密報到局，以憑懲戒。</p>
<p>警政方面六項問題</p>
<p>嗣由陳彬　提出六項問題：　普通警察平時有無訓練？　新警察現在訓練情形如何？　前巡捕房時代之「包打聽」制度是否改善？　各分局司法手續較前有無改良？　名項道　罰款有無規定，其用途之支配若何？　督察處與前巡捕房時代有無改進？當由蘇副局長及各有關處長分別說明，善於第一二兩問題，警察局現在警士訓練所兩處，一在榆林路，一在打浦橋，兩處原有章則制度不同，現已合併統一，新警訓練及舊警再教育同時並重，分司法，保甲，特高，行政等班。課程要點分三項：甲.精神訓練，乙.學科教練，丙.術科教練。至於勤務中之警察，亦實施一般訓練，每日由局頒發訓練注意要　，由各分局，分局長各警官長　講述，不久本市第一二兩警局合併後，更將著重在一般教育之實施，同時特別注意改善警察生活，在精神上與物質上雙方並進，造成新的良好警察。</p>
<p>關於前巡捕房時代之司法手續與「包打聽」缺席有無改善一節，由司法處長李時雨說明：從來公共租界巡捕房與法租界巡捕房關於司法制度不同，本局自與第三警察局及　西警察局合併以來，刻已　一司法制度，在總局設司法處，採取限集中勤務散在制，各分局設司法股，受分局長之指揮監督，其工作之審核與指導，則由司法處掌理之。至於司法警察已往訓練缺乏，近半年來已設司法警員訓練班，除授以法律常識，（包打聽）亦曾受上述訓練者，計六十余人，現在正在計畫提高探員之程度，擬招大學畢業生若干人授以有關司法警察常識，使探員之素質提高，而安全社會。</p>

<h3 id="c37">一面推進作戰　一面積極建設　出淵部長談湖南現狀 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>盟邦上海　車報導部出淵部長，此次特赴湖南前線視察，始於日前　，昨（二十六）日下午三時，該部循例舉行之報導常會，出淵部長亦躬親偕同赤星　托準時　會，撞見本市中國新聞記者，即席由出淵部長就此行在湖南戰線視察所見，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>衡陽戰況</p>
<p>出淵部長首謂：本人此次赴湖南前線視察，所見在日軍進駐下之和平區一般狀況，善於衡陽之兩頭，一部分由日軍部隊加以佔領外，自本月十五日起，又開始更積極列猛烈之攻擊，　已沿汀江江岸進擊，情形頗為順利，頃已進抵衡陽市街之一隅太子碼頭。本月二十一日晨，日軍又猛烈攻擊渝薜岳所派遣衡陽之援救軍，已將在衡陽西方邀擊南方，另從南方而下之日軍，亦在衡陽西方邀擊該軍，是以目前之渝薜岳援救軍，已正背被擊在茲情形之下無力　　。又本月二十日左右由太太向南推進之日軍五十軍慘敗部隊，加以殲滅之中。此外，在荼陵方面之日軍，亦已向遁走西方山地之渝三十七軍慘敗部隊，予以殲滅，已於二十二日　推進至安仁。總之，在衡陽四週慘敗渝軍均成為　中之　，無法重振，已遭受殲滅之命運，其整個消滅，公為時間上的問題。</p>
<p>人民來歸</p>
<p>出淵部長繼謂：關於從岳洲至衡陽之公路，及岳洲至長少之公路，多半遭渝軍敗走時摧毀，尤以岳洲與半遭渝軍敗走時摧毀，尤以岳洲與長少一　為甚，幫稍為困苦。惟日軍一方在推進作戰上，一面又積極從事建設，在急捷的工程下，已逐步予以修復，獲得助力非淺。查日軍對於運輸路線恢復工作，費了相當的努力，及下最大之苦心，且每一修路附近之鄉民，均赤　為日軍貢獻一切，並且願協力，故在修復之工作上。亦獲得頗大之幫助。其次，長少附近之兩頭，當地人民已陸續來歸，足以反映治安上建設上的進展，且歸返人民日益增加，最多的一日約有一千婁百餘名。如市內情形，一般大的商店雖未恢復，而普通商店乃已逐漸複業，井有日僑方面新設店鋪頗多，確信在短期內，市容明朗繁榮。當初長沙開展作戰時，該地居民避難，並不過遙，均避居附近村落，生活情形頗為安定，此次重歸故鄉時，簡便異常，且該處日軍，在作戰行動四及建設行動上，均遵照初中最高指揮官司之意旨，當地人民深為安心，且熟讀抄寫日軍最高指揮官之安民佈告，轉告一般華人，幫該處民眾莫不對日軍深切信賴，井至誠協力。</p>
<p>生活安定</p>
<p>關於情形，農民安心種植稻穀，郊外碧綠一片，殊為豐年之兆，故在建設及治安之逐步恢復下，本來面目已大部復原，深信今秋以後，更為明朗，且有新的姿態更生。同時該地米價微賤，僅千三百元，較上海最高時米價相較，祇抵十分之一強而已。醒湖南自經日軍進領後，各該地由「抗戰」化為和平區，一切設施，更的明朗的超出往昔，鄉民無不歡忻雀躍，介為在渝美空軍之一貫慘無人道的野蠻行為下，恒擾亂偵察，甚至向不重要之村落盲目轟炸，雖未有多大損害，其無辜傷害平民，益使該地民眾對之唾棄。</p>
<p>補給通暢</p>
<p>最後出淵雙詳述補給線之縮短，及打通延長戰線上有頗大之價值，且在作戰上之使得良非　　，故補給線之溝通，以縮短距離，不但有利，於作戰且更可圓滑暢通，惟敵美在南太平洋之戰略　　，我人估計彼　在全盤戰局上，已極為不利，其本身在地勢上。如補給線　拖長，其作戰更遭困獸難雲雲。</p>
<h3 id="c38">粉麥統制會　收麥價格決定　資金暫由收買商籌墊 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>商紡會粉麥紡制委員會改組成立後，現已依據即訂之粉麥統收統配辦法，　　中日代理商指定收買商，在蘇浙皖三省及京　兩特別市各地區工內展開收買小麥工作。所有收買小麥資金在該會向中日銀行借款問題未解決前，暫由各收買商　墊並照倒給付利息至於收買小麥價格，現已完全決定，惟各地區收買小麥價格稍有不同，係視各產麥域名物價高低及農民生活之比率而確定合理標準價格，故預料此次收買工作，必較以往更形順利，收買數量成績，必超過去年收進數量，對於民食之輔佐裨益　鮮。</p>

<p>棉花增產協議總會，對於棉花增產事宜，現依據增產計畫逐步推進。茲悉該會於日前會召集常務委員會議，討論江北　地區開發棉田問題，業已確定開發地區，及資金等要案，積極進行開發任務，聞該會為增強戰時棉花需要，本年決努力棉花增產二百五十萬擔之目的。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3 id="c41">無場與節電 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>本市電力供給，將自下月起再度普還限制。電車行駛，亦將養活車輛與次數。電力限制的原因，是為煤斤來源短少，是原料不足的問題，也可以說不得已的消極辦法。我們一面希望當局竭力設法疏運煤斤以外，一面對於電力，不得不希望再加合理的關整。</p>
<p>怎樣調整呢？生產業應不減或少減。生活消耗（如電訊電熨斗電冰箱等）及娛樂場所等；應減至最小限度或絕對禁用。</p>
<p>跳舞場是娛樂場所之一，在此戰時根本就不應存在，而本跳舞場大小林立，依然鼎盛，已屬不可思議。自上次電力限制後，各舞場限令十一時後不準備營業。但聞　西區尚有若干處舞場，依然營業至大明四時，顯然違反法令。為什麼滬西警務當局不予取締？如果說該舞場逾時營業，已得特准，未悉該管當局根據什麼法令予以特准？</p>
<p>在此再度節電聲中，我們希望此等不合理現象。從速取締，從速消　。</p>

<p>在戰事以前，鄕村農戶，每十家，總有四家，自己擁用耕牛，輪流僱用，足夠維持抽水工作。然時至今日，他們因為生活所迫，差不多將相依為命的耕牛，都被變賣了。吾鄕浦東，因為耕牛缺乏之故，每一頭牛，總要耕種六十畝之多，實在不敷輪流，於是十分之七八的稻田，因無法戽水，田中泥土，都呈龜裂之象。如果不謀挽救，聽其自然，那末禾苗枯槁，秋收一定無望。到那時候，農民所受損失，眞是不堪設想。旁的不說，單就豆餠一端而論，目下每張需費一千一百五十元，其他肥田粉以及工料等等，尙不在內，農民將何以為生？故亟盼當局，迅籌對策，搶救農村，不獨農民之幸，亦民食前途之福也。（陳　昌）</p>
<h3 id="c52">杜絕電車賣票員　舞弊之建議 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>電車賣票員之手揩油問題雖經公司當局屢次設法改良制止。但揩油之風依然未減，其根本辦法當然要請公司方面盡量提高賣票之薪水，至少便能維持最低之生活。假如在加薪後仍有舞弊行為者不妨採用下列各種對策：</p>
<p>提高車票，頭三等一律五元，但已用過之頭等廢票可至售票處找回現鈔二元，三等廢票則可找回現鈔三元半（此等廢票換鈔票或可請各大烟紙號代理之。）</p>
<p>關於電力之查票問題，公司方面可程請保甲委員會合作，在車站附近之自警團員當乘客下車時有檢查其車票之義務。乘客如無車票者須補買之。賣票員如有舞弊者須記其號碼報吿電車公司嚴辦之。這樣乘客下車時必須要有車票。賣票員當然無從施其技。</p>
<p>車票之價格雖可以一律，然票面之顏色不可不分。且須註明乘客下車時之站名，以便檢查而杜流弊。（蔡禮雍）</p>
<h3 id="c53">對於「廢劵貼花」的意見 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>閱七月廿五日國民論壇有將廢劵貼花補助敎育基金之建議。筆者略有意見，抒述如下：</p>
<p>破損法幣若需貼花，各商店在交易時收受法幣，必儘量挑剔，而對於將近破損而尙未破損之法幣足不予收受，如何辦法？蓋法幣在輾轉收付之際，無形破捐，稍一不愼，豈非白受捐失，商店所持之理由也對。</p>
<p>貼花後之破損劵流通與不流通瓿，兩者均有困難，若仍流通，而所貼之紙質印花再度破捐，如何辦法？若不流通，市民如有少量或小數之掉換，其所得之値尙不償車資，市民寗願棄去，兩相損失。</p>
<p>國家銀行每日收受之待查劵究有多少，必須仔細調查淸楚，以免得不償失，若稅率過高，市民損失多，流幣也多。</p>
<p>欲實行廢劵貼花，必須克復上述困難之點。（忠作忠祈）</p>
<h3 id="c54">科學技術座談會 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>備藤：是的。我們就是按照這個方法進行的。試看各方面所研究的結果，例如全國科學技術聯合會方面，聽到研究的結果報告出來的時候，就可以知道這一點。他們問，怎樣就可以使我們的工作現實化，凡是能使用者，立刻就被採用。請再看一個例子，是數天前決定的事情，海軍方面在從事各方面的某一部長就來對我說，海軍方面在從事這種研究，好像是很可以用的。按你的意見，是否可以立刻適用於現實工作上。既然得到一個通知，命我檢查一下是否適用，要給一個確實回答，所以立刻就加以檢查試驗，結果非常適用。那末好，立刻就採用吧！和軍需省商量一下，就給從業者下命令吧！在這個期間，請幫忙！這一件事情業已有兩　期了。那至少對於戰力增強，是非常有效果的研究。聽到那種結果，立刻在兩星期內就搬到生產機關去了。在我們看來，至少所研究的結論，並不需要很多霎時和能達生產機關的，自然，立刻就會想辦法，對於增強力有所貢獻。實在是按照戰時方法進行的。這就是在我們專門進行的統制會內，所必然走的前途，而其他以企業為主要前途，那是另一件事。一般說來，現代的企業家也往往按國定的要求，進行研究，所以並不是先用算嚴打算一下是否有利，然後才施之於企業上的，遵守命令，如果所研究的成果，是必要的，對於國家是必要的，那末就去生產，不管需要多少設備和資本。是許可後就要實行的，所以這種研究的結果，專門家估計有充分實際化可能的時候，就毫不猶豫，立刻搬到生產機關去。</p>
<p>試驗研究命令與生產化研究</p>
<p>花田：對於技術院的工作，最簡單者是就接受發明計　。收到後，也有立刻轉交軍部的，同時簡單者，則立刻出錢命令製造實物。稍微規模大者，就以試驗研究命令，命令著手研究。同時，由於去掉的機構改革，而新產生出生產技術部來，而生產化研究也曾耗費了許多金錢。因此，試驗研究的對象，　或轉交到企業家手裏，也需要加以發揮光大，是有冒險性的，因為或許不能生產。凡是對於國家必要的，都要支出相當　項進行生產的。對於軍需省的軍需公司法案，出賜與這樣的權限，所謂先　工場，或冒險工場，凡企業家不願動手者。都由政府的津貼和補助，而不斷加以生產。近來成了統制經濟，　令一個人發明了一件好的東西，想取得資材從事製造，也是一件很不容易的事。所以如無政府那樣後盾，是絕對辦不到的。　或企業家有意作，但目前環境也有所不能。同時，現在成立了一種體制，　　或企業家無意作，假如是重要的事情，也強迫他作。這種範圍，我們認為應該是這樣的。老實說，研究這悠揚事情，就是播種和芽，自然，生芽後就把他移植到山上去，但如認為芽已出來，立刻就移植到山上去，往往有很多會死掉的。總而言之，仍然還需要在苗圃裏培養一個相當時期。這樣東西是在苗圃培養的。生產化研究應該在苗圃內培養一個相當時期，等到枝葉長得堅固後，才能移植到山上去的。此外也有不培養在苗圃裏，而立刻直接在山上培養出來的。關於播種方面還有稍微困難的地方，那就是政府方面的困難。因為需要預算，也需要買到資材。在我們所研究的大者，就立刻與軍需省或陸海軍取得接觸，以便試作。因為大家都非常的熱心，且系統不亂，所以一定會一帆風順的。</p>
<p>：關於方才　的話，我們方面在統制會所研究的，再用統制會的力量製造出來，是不充分的，另外統制會用全力作尚有不可能的問題，只好交與技術院，而把我們的研究，再加以試作，或使之能生產化。一般技術員動手作的工作，並不問這是為統制會，也不問這是為研究團體，即是為國家，大家就應當協力下手作。</p>
<p>稻村：在這樣條件上，最初的研究者，是否從試作到最後的生產，都要始終跟著走呢？抑還是生產時，就與研究者無關了呢？</p>
<p>花田：兩種情形都有。</p>
<p>稻村：我曾從一個服務於公司的朋友聽到一個故事，過於拘泥於形式主義，而研究部，試作部，生產機關三者，各自成為獨立的機構，所以一個工作轉交試作部，由試作部再轉交生產，在這種情形上，最初的研究者，如跟　一直到最後中，則效率非常大，且極細微的地方也可以注意到。如交與別外的人作，則回不明瞭最初研究者的動機，往往任意變更，結果把主要弄錯，以致試作遲延，或工業化脫期，這是事上難免的</p>
<p>花田：最近在處理一個問題，就是想從日本資源中生產日本所沒有的資源。這是某一研究所埋頭苦幹的一件工作。去掉的夏天開始研究，而現在業已得出答案來了。這立到由研究動員會議受理，研究動員會議後就開始工作，然而這個研究所是沒有工場所應血的條件的。所以這個研究所的前此研究，過了所謂山坡後，前面就只剩一條道路了。在工業方面是需要某種寬道的，所以就可以知道前此從有偏右或偏左的事情發生，也會出了常軌，材料從有變更，也必須按著這個目的生產下去。這樣工作，在研究所中不斷地作下去。即如是，就以研究所的人為中心，同時命令其他公司實行生產，於是就全部使用工場的即存社備，另外再補充不足的地方，一時一刻也要爭取，儘量提前移到和產上去。在這上面仍然還有工場上的問題，固然可笑，然而未知數尚非常的多。那就跟具有工場各種條件的去作。於是就以公司的人為中心來作，　研究所的人就參加到這個地方來，同時公司派人到研究所裏來作。公司方面也就不再估計合算不合算的問題，而外則政府補助資材或其他物品，而從事生產。假如研究成果物品一度出現後，則立刻由技術院交與軍需省</p>
<p>大橋：現在我要說幾句離題稍遠的話，根據衝動員法，頒佈試驗研究全集時，從業者雖然支出莫大的一筆研究費，但政府的獎勵金很省，且只是按其向政府所作的報告書，而補償共經營費及人事費的。此外大多數工場，並不具有試作工場，於是就把試作品和生產品混淆到一起，以致試作幾種多的工場，就一落千丈，而在企業方面，就是一個相當大的負擔。所以如不建立一個具有國家意義的企業，則委有可能不熱心從事試驗研究。我主人為國家應當有獨立的度作工場。很少優秀技術家的今天，　然對於多數工場發出試驗研究命令，但因難於完成歙珠工場很多，就會一再拖延招待，所以我認為把優秀技術家都動員到國家的試作工場來，這種方法最好。假如這種試作工場不能立刻實現的話，至少也要把從業者方面的優秀技術家組成一個報國團之類的組織。隨時都能幫助接到試驗研究命令的工場，我主為這樣也可以。</p>
<p>花田：在試驗研究期間，也有總動員試驗研究命令，同時還有不如此緊張的委託研究。也有極簡單的委託形式。此外一直到與工場無大差別的，與企業無大差別的生產化研究。其間自然有各種階段。所以必須按客觀形勢，而採取適當　置，在這一點上是一種官　，所以我認為非常方便。</p>
<p>局部改良的必要與獎勵</p>
<p>稻村：在創意課會產出許多偉大的結果來　？</p>
<p>花田：會有過相當有意義的事。我雖然沒有聽到一切的事情，但其中手續麻煩的，也沒發生阻力，凡是有興趣者，都會一個一個地交與陸海軍方面。</p>
<p>大橋：在德國為了城市中的發明家，而組織專資公會，努力使新實用計畫企業化，關於專　原料問題，也在　旋從業者等，勿使發生糾紛。假如一起糾紛，就以公會內的調解裁判缺席加以解決。裁判是由專　特許局的官吏，公會長，以及糾紛者同業中之一個理事，三人組成　的，這樣就可以加以適當的處理。</p>
<p>稻村：只要對於一般事情加以努力，認為能有新物發生就夠了。在實際的生產機關內，往往從局部改良運動中產生有意義的結果。在生產機構內，前此所忽略的微細改良，這據說都會得到很好的成績。所以局部的改良，也是非常有意義的。</p>
<p>花田：局部改良出現時，如素質良好，就由於獎勵金制度，也能引導局部改良。走向好的方向。</p>
<p>大橋：生產機構內初等獎勵局部改良政策，會有時候對於優秀的改良，就賜與獎學金，使其子弟得入大學。目前釣魚業憶不能鼓舞勞動者努力工作的時候，而用獎學金方法，煽動起對子弟的教育熱，以備將來效勞國家，這真是一舉兩得的好辦法。</p>
<p>記者：統制會方面，在這樣場合採取何種具體方法呢？</p>
<p>備藤：在統制會方面，是在小規模地進行著。（未完）（季　目四月號日本　論）</p>

<p>充滿着國家性</p>
<p>再需要說的，就是戲劇內農富地注入或保持國家性和共同性這個現象。原來戲劇（固然不單限於戲劇）含有國家性和共同性，這是理所當然的事，但在過去的資本主義或自由主義時代的戲劇體制，則決不如此，事實則正相反，他們認為有錢可賺，任何劇本都可以上演，縱使對國民精种含有毒素的劇本，也不妨上演，這就是此種演劇態度，並不顧到國家和民族的利益。不容許這種態度的存在，縱在承平時代也是應當的，何况今日這樣愈演愈烈的決戰階段呢，當然更用不着任何贅言的</p>
<p>就是這種關係，因為時局的吃緊，而此種態度逐漸開始受到非難和指責，因於關係電局的積極統制和指導，以及演員的自覺，所以過去的瑕疵，逐次肅淸，尤其在寶行非常措置後，這種肅淸運動愈益加強了。前而講過的流劇團之成立及其活動，也全一改前非，此外不久前，地方農村和織山工塲等內盛極一時的厚生劇團業餘演員運動，也可以說按正確方向在前進着。這兩種運動，都是否認戲劇中的個人性和營利性的，戲戲的目的在於慰藉人民，提拱藝衛，宣傳國策，啓發文化等，至於上述的國家性和共同性，當然也是戲劇所應有的態度</p>
<p>大都市的職業劇團</p>
<p>關於大都市的職業劇團的這種傾向，也逐漸因統制而強化了，但在非常措置令上很淸楚的指出這一方向，而強制要求其就範。在非常措置後的今天，在一部份的人間，高談闊論着國粗管理戲劇，團體管理戲劇等問題，以及設立戲劇團策公司，戲劇營團等問題，道顯然是證明想要採取強制手段的。</p>
<p>這一問題，特別按今日主觀和客觀形勢來看，只是深深感覺到微妙和困難，而關係官應甚至尚未發表任何積極性的指示說明，竟徘徊躊躇於慎重態度裏。但今日這樣演劇形態，當然不允許其繼續存在，而必須加以改革。</p>
<p>國民戲劇創造</p>
<p>現在再談一下目前戲劇的革新方面。這在積極方面，戲是創造設建立國民數劇，在消極方面，就是科正現代戲劇的城市性，西歐性，頹廢性，　壓性，消費性等等的缺陷。前者遠在數年前，業巳有一部先知先覺的戲劇家曾提倡過，不久前遙一命題業已成為戲劇家及文化人全體的一致要求。現在以情報局為中心的官廳，以及其他周圍團體的文化組織，開始努力嘗試了。</p>
<p>換言之，情報局每年拿出巨賞來鼓勵所有劇團參加國民戲劇義賽，而表彰和獎賞優秀作品。日本文化中央聯盟，在稱為各種大衆戲朗的一切團體問，曾懸賞競賽過，同時收獲到相當有藝術價值的成績。這二者，對於國民生活加以慰安，且與以無上的精神力，思想則以日本式的世界觀為基準，藝術則創造具有日本古典戲劇傳統的優秀戲劇。同時，也要努力辦理陸海軍，軍事保護院以及其他官廳所發動的這種直接提高戰意，增加生產等的政治性國民戲劇。</p>
<p>上演時間調整</p>
<p>後者就是內務省和警視廳實行劇本檢查，演出檢查的一種制度。所以就是禁止上演西歐式英美藝備之類的戲劇，以及絕對禁止富有城市的頹廢性戲劇等。例如以無聊生活為體材的戲劇，或者以女性為中心的桃色戲劇，或者單純迎合低級趣味的喜劇，或者始終模做英美手法的輕音樂劇，這都需耍加以壓迫和禁止。尤其對於少女的歌劇，應常絕對取締。</p>
<p>還有在非常措置後，上演時間為二小時半的制度，而現在都議諭紛紜，莫衷一是地爭論着，但在主張縮短時間這一點，可以說是十家一致的要求。還有以大日本演劇協會為中心的全國巡迥劇團，加以積極的統制和指導，這也是令人注意的一件。</p>
<p>戲劇家的盡忠報國</p>
<p>上面所講的，就是決戰階段上日本戲劇的一般動向，並且這也是今日戲劇無容爭論的姿態。對於這方面為取得良好結果，指揮者官廳則絕對需要建立存力的一元演劇政策，而必須實行戲劇家自覺，所促的積極主觀贊助。</p>
<p>近數年來，這兩個方面與時俱增地逐漸達上了軌通。戲劇往往由於因襲而陷於複雜微妙的境界，這種錯誤百出的現象，不能說絕對沒有。非常措置，遂漸面對着一個明顯的終極目標，向前突飛猛進着。</p>
<p>按今日的情勢來說，尚有各種困難，而未收獲到充分成果。但關係官廳的積極領導，日本戲劇會的成立等，前面已經講過，現在業已打破了己往的障碍，且在決戰階段下已經成為創造戲劇的有效推進力了。過去我們常常看到的戲劇家那種「莫談國事」的怪癖，業已消形匿跡，現在全部戲劇家都在眞正民族意識之下，準備為自己的職業崗位，鞠躬盡瘁。日本戲劇的改組和調整，必將在最近的未來，取得完好的結果（完）（安譯自七月六日每日新聞）</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>在教務長室掛着籃色台布的開桌對面，肥頭大耳的I上校，露出半截身體來。</p>
<p>「眞是好機會。雖然是星天，但因查一點事情，所以未出校………」</p>
<p>「一定很忙吧！」</p>
<p>隆夫很客氣地這樣問。</p>
<p>「不，半小時的工夫總有。我很想讓畫軍艦的畫家看看潛水艇。」</p>
<p>嗓子聲音雖然相當粗躁，但是含着微笑。新田少尉因有事面到城裏去了，所以在坐者只有隆夫和眞人兩個了。</p>
<p>「方才業已看過練習艦了。全都是令人驚奇不止的事。」</p>
<p>隆夫表示着感激。</p>
<p>「我在潛水艇上服務業已很久了……常艦長，完全都把頭髮弄白了。但這並不是艇內生活苦。忍受那種苦，照理是軍人應份的事。也許說那是軍人的責任，更為恰當。再沒有感覺到比濟水艇長還大的責任。」</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>「常然，這不是說艇長一個人勞苦。如非全部人員都緊張起來，往往因舵手和排注水手的些許不注意，竟招致沒頂大禍。所以全部人員的呼吸，必須上下一致。同時，世界上就沒有比得上潛水艇那樣有家庭感覺的艦艇。或許這是因為全部人員的生命都由潛水艇來支持所致，同時上至艇長士官，下至兵卒，大家吃同樣好壞的飯。這樣事情，在其他種艦裏就不這樣。此外艇長和士官，非常關心兵卒。兵卒也很信賴長官……。我也會給一個兵士作過媒人，令他們結婚過……」</p>
<p>I校被日光晒焦了的面孔上，透出來無限的笑意。</p>
<p>隆夫認為發生這樣上下一致的感情，原因或許是由於過去從未體騐的潛過去所致。例如有一羣人逃到陰山背後去，長期實行人所不知的苦行和奮鬥，於是就產生團結和精誠，這豈不是和潛水艇員一樣麼？老實說，開始看太平洋風波大作的今天，都把視綫逐漸集中於雜誌報章，這誰肯談潛水艇的事呢？只是潛水艇遇艱時，或許會引起世人的注意。降夫心中這樣反反復復地思索</p>
<p>「去年八月成潛上士的死，也就是一個具體表現。自己捨身搶救浸水，這自然是想保護至尊的帝國艦艇心所致，但我認為另一面則是對可信賴的長官和親愛的部下等最大友情的流露。」</p>
<p>I上校的語調裹，已經含着沉痛的意思了。（一二四）</p>

<h3 id="e1">On the European Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Question: In the past few days, attention from all sectors has shifted from the Japanese cabinet reshuffle to the European situation. Furthermore, many people are extrapolating from the European situation to the East Asian situation. I wonder what your opinion is?</p>
<p>Answer: The current situation in Europe and the East Asian situation are completely separate matters and cannot be discussed together. As for engaging in unwarranted worries based on the European situation, it inevitably invites the criticism of being a busybody!</p>
<p>Question: What is the latest situation in Europe?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding the European situation, the most notable thing seems to be the assassination attempt on German leader Hitler. Actually, this matter is already yesterday's news and there is no need for speculation. According to reports from various sources, as well as the broadcast speech by leader Hitler, it can be known that the perpetrators were just some non-active German officers, and had nothing to do with any German command. It had no impact on morale or public sentiment. Currently, the German government has appointed Goering as the supreme military representative and Himmler as the commander of the domestic defense forces, which can further strengthen national defense capabilities.</p>
<p>Question: Then what is the trend of the European war situation?</p>
<p>Answer: The future of the European war does not depend on internal German affairs. The key lies in the following two aspects: the Eastern Front, Northern France, and the Balkans. Regarding the battles on the Eastern Front, since the British and American invasion of Europe began, the Soviet Union seized the opportunity to launch a large-scale summer offensive, and the fighting has been fierce. However, on the Finnish-Soviet front in the north, the Soviet army has made no progress after capturing Vyborg. On the southern Ukrainian-Romanian front, the Red Army is also lingering at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains, at a loss. Only the three armies of the "Baltic Coast" in the center and the three armies of "Belarus" have made more progress. The northern route has approached the East Prussian border, and the southern route has also invaded old Poland, threatening Warsaw. However, the German forces in this area have followed their planned maneuvers, dealing blows to the Soviet forces and then calmly withdrawing. The Soviet plan to encircle and annihilate them has not been fully successful.</p>
<p>As for Northern France, although the US and British forces are numerous, the area they have occupied has not yet exceeded one hundred kilometers. The reason why they have failed to advance as rapidly as on the Eastern Front is due to the strong defensive capabilities and clever tactics of the German army, and the lack of fighting spirit of the British and American soldiers.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no significant progress on the Italian front for the anti-Axis forces. Even in the Balkans, which has long attracted attention, the overall situation still favors the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Question: What new developments are there in the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>Answer: From the perspective of the overall world war situation, Britain and the United States are still at a disadvantage, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, in terms of strategy, Britain and the United States have no choice but to be restrained by the Soviet Union. However, as the military and political influence of the Soviet Union in Europe and the Balkans increases, the suspicion and antipathy of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union are also increasing. This is also a fact that cannot be ignored. Therefore, we can infer that: the contradictions between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in their offensive strategy in Europe will inevitably become increasingly acute; the diplomatic battles between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union over various European exiled governments will become increasingly fierce; and conflicts between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, from strategy to political strategy, are still unavoidable.</p>
<p>Question: What are the anti-Axis powers doing in East Asia?</p>
<p>Answer: The contradictions between the anti-Axis powers in Europe have not yet been fully revealed due to the severity of the war situation. However, the contradictions in their policies towards East Asia are very public. Last year, the Soviet Union refused to participate in the Cairo Conference of Luo, Qiu, and Jiang because of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. This year, a new agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union was announced, which shows that the Soviet Union is determined not to be used by Britain and the United States as a pawn in East Asia. This fact has a great impact on the security of Japan's northern borders. At the same time, Britain and the United States are therefore isolated in East Asia. In addition, at this time when the European situation is becoming increasingly critical, Britain and the United States are both feeling exhausted from the European war. Their risky invasion of Saipan and Guam is a manifestation of their inner anxiety when they are exhausted.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The regular cabinet meeting in Japan on the 25th was held at the Imperial Palace at 9:00 AM. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. The military reported on the war situation. At 12:15 PM, everyone had lunch at the Prime Minister's official residence. At 1:10 PM, the meeting continued. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu explained the recent European situation. Then, after resolving the budget formulation policy for next year proposed by the Minister of Finance, they earnestly discussed current issues. The meeting adjourned at 3:07 PM. In addition, the new cabinet has been discussing ways to strengthen the domestic situation in response to the critical war situation for several days. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th, cabinet members exchanged views on measures to address the current war situation. More specific discussions will be held in the future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – The budget formulation policy for next year in Japan has been completed after discussions between Minister of Finance Ishiwata and officials from the Ministry of Finance. It was formally decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 25th and officially announced by the Information Bureau at 3:00 PM on the 25th. The formulation of the new budget is based on the Koiso-Yonai cabinet's policy of total national strength for military purposes. The main points are as follows: The most important objective is to participate in the war with total national strength, utilizing all intelligence and ability, and practicing endurance and hard work to strengthen the system for certain victory and no defeat. In terms of budget formulation and implementation, a mobile formulation policy will be adopted to cope with the war situation, to deal with sudden changes, air raids, and other unforeseen events, and to meticulously review national funds, material mobilization, and labor mobilization plans. The budget will prioritize increased aircraft production and other emergency measures. Based on the above policy, new budgets from all ministries will not be approved, and only the established expenses will be implemented. Outside of the established expenses, provisional expenditures will be made with budget funds. Therefore, the budget control outline and itemized planning methods that have been followed for the past few years will be completely abolished. Matters that need to be implemented due to changes in the situation will be decided by the cabinet or by official meetings. This kind of mobile budget method is quite noteworthy.</p>
<h3 id="e3">National Defense Conference Passes Outline of Rural Construction Plan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The National Defense Conference held its 52nd meeting today (the 26th). After reading the minutes of the previous meeting, discussions began. Excerpts of the resolutions are as follows:</p>

Sun Yucai was specially appointed as a member of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – Since the Incident, rural areas have been extremely dilapidated, with almost no construction to speak of. Although there are many reasons for the decline, the main ones are: poor security for farmers, unsound local administration, and the inability to find reasonable solutions to issues such as the price and transportation of agricultural products. As a result, production has decreased, and the lives of farmers have fallen into hardship. The impact has caused social and economic unrest, and administrative power has been unable to be exerted. In order to address these ills and seek improvement, the National Economic Committee has specially drafted an outline for rural construction, which was revised and approved by the National Defense Conference, and plans to organize a Rural Construction Implementation Committee in the short term to be responsible for promoting the plan. All parties attach great importance to this, because the universal construction of rural areas is the foundation for the survival and development of our country, and the establishment of the plan outline is the initial work for rural construction. At the same time, during this decisive period, the phenomenon of material shortages can be addressed through the success of rural construction, which will increase production and streamline the supply of materials. This will not only stabilize people's livelihoods and ensure military needs but also contribute to the Greater East Asia War by sharing the major responsibility of building East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Outline of the Rural Construction Plan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The general outline of the rural construction plan: Purpose The focus of the policy of our National Government this year is "purifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production." These three are mutually reinforcing and must be combined as a whole to advance simultaneously. In terms of the order of priority, emphasis should be placed on increasing production... The most prominent reasons are roughly the following six: poor security in rural areas; extortion of farmers by various armed groups; shortcomings in the price, purchasing methods, and marketing of agricultural products; many shortcomings in local administration; lack of thoroughness in farmers' education and lack of farmers' organization; and the lack of vitality and inadequacy of agricultural technology guidance agencies and economic assistance agencies. Now, in order to eliminate these reasons, it is necessary to start with rural construction. Only by engaging in rural construction can we strengthen rural organizations, establish general agricultural development, and further integrate the relationship between urban and rural areas, cultivate national social strength, and promote culture, thereby ensuring China's future leapfrog development. What China suffers most from at present is the soaring rise in prices, the insufficient production of food, the failure to thoroughly implement clean government, the failure to properly reform the tax system, and the failure to achieve peaceful reunification at an early date. How to make the existing army return to farming after demobilization must all wait for the universal expansion of rural construction before a fundamental solution with lasting nature can be obtained. In order to completely suppress prices and reduce the problem of insufficient food, production must be increased and the exchange of products must be ensured. Only then can a clean government be implemented, which greatly depends on the overall reform of local military forces and administrative power. Therefore, the reform of the tax system must first be determined by the consolidation of in-kind taxation and miscellaneous taxes. Therefore, promoting peaceful reunification relies on the implementation of good governance under the rule of our National Government to increase the trust of the people in other regions and their leaders in our National Government and to resolutely break away and return. In order to make the army return to farming after demobilization, rural security must be ensured. In short, all of the above-mentioned points must wait for the early success of rural construction before they can be gradually and concretely realized. Moreover, the administrative power of our National Government and its concept of participating in the war must also strive for rural construction before they can penetrate among the Chinese people. This is without a doubt. Key points of implementation According to the current situation and stage of economic development in our country, rural construction should take the county as the basic unit.

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) – United Press special correspondent reported on the 25th regarding the Hunan war situation as follows: Japanese troops on the Hunan front have gradually compressed the encirclement of Hengyang. The Chongqing troops coming to rescue have not yet been able to break through the Japanese army's encirclement. Therefore, the battle of Hengyang, which has been going on for nearly a month, is gradually reaching its final stage. If the Japanese army captures Hengyang, the salient point of the Chongqing army in the southeast of the city will be removed, and then the attack on the 270-kilometer section of the Yuehan line still in the hands of the Chongqing army will inevitably begin. The correspondent also described the tragic battle of Hengyang as follows: According to front-line news, in the month since June 25, the Japanese army concentrated artillery fire to annihilate the encircled Chongqing army in Hengyang and broke into the New Street outside the old city and broke through the city wall twice to enter the old city. In one month, the Chongqing army only broke through the encirclement in the Ximen urban area twice, and at that time, it contacted the Western rescue troops. However, by July 10, it had been encircled by the Japanese army again. The Chongqing army in Hengyang has three months' worth of food, and other weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies are also supplied by aircraft.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Social Affairs hosted capital Chinese and foreign reporters at the Nanjing Joint Recreation Club at 3:00 PM on the 26th, answering questions from reporters. The details are as follows: Regarding the preparation of the Shanghai vagrant labor camp, the current further work is to rectify the second step of preparation.

It is now provisionally estimated that 1,000 vagrants will be accommodated, and the main labor work will be agriculture. Regarding the production work of the Huainan Coal Mine Company, due to the small number of workers, in order to adjust the number of workers in the company, it is planned to establish labor recruitment offices in the Jianghuai area to be responsible for recruiting workers.

<p>Nanjing, Jiang, 16th (Central News Agency) – In the past, Huazhong Railway had a large number of passengers, and there were smugglers everywhere. However, the number of tickets sold daily was limited, resulting in a much larger gap between supply and actual transportation demand. As a result, unscrupulous people rushed to buy tickets and resold them on the black market, sometimes exceeding the ticket price by three or four times. This greatly affected the transportation of legitimate passengers. The authorities have issued a general ban, but this phenomenon has not yet been eradicated. In addition, a small number of unscrupulous employees within the Huazhong Railway Company take advantage of their positions to sell black tickets. This is not only a concern for the Huazhong Railway Company's authorities but will also affect the transportation of legitimate passengers. Therefore, it is hoped that the Huazhong Railway Company's authorities will quickly rectify the situation. At the same time, the Ministry of Construction authorities should also earnestly assume their supervisory responsibility to ensure that this undesirable phenomenon is completely eradicated.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Ibrahim, the Mufti here, in response to the May statement of Grand Mufti Fu Sen of the Islamic Church in Judea, which pointed out the direction for Muslims to advance during the world war, issued a statement on the 25th while bedridden, calling on Muslims to unite and strive for independence (Note: Mufti Ibrahim has been ill in bed since this spring and is currently being treated by Dr. Sakaguchi, Director of the Department of Internal Medicine at Tokyo University). The gist of his speech is as follows: The Islamic nation is now at a critical juncture of survival. At this time, all Muslims must pay attention to the following two points. The first is the long-term spiritual union between East Asia and Muslims. Muslims have always been subject to the aggression of Western European nations, such as the Crusades in ancient times and British imperialism in modern times, which are obvious examples. However, Islam and East Asia have always maintained friendly relations. Whether in China or India, Islam can be spread arbitrarily. In particular, Japan has given great sympathy and support to the independence of oppressed Islamic nations and Asian nations. Therefore, East Asian countries and Japan are all allies of Muslims. The second is that Muslims must always unite sincerely and strive for independence. Opportunities have now matured in various parts of West Asia. Britain fears the encroachment of the United States and is now buying the hearts of Muslims. We Muslims should take this opportunity to form an Arab Federation with the Arabs, unite as one, and prepare to counterattack the British and American forces. Therefore, we must cooperate with East Asia, which is now working hard to destroy Britain and the United States, in order to promote the revival of Muslims. I am determined to devote all my efforts to this path until this goal is achieved.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German official announcement states that the Head of State has appointed Goebbels as the Commissioner General for Total Mobilization. The following is the gist of the Head of State's order: The situation of the war is now actively demanding that all armed forces and military preparations be exhausted. Therefore, the following points are announced: Marshal Goering, Chairman of the German Defense Agreement Council, has proposed the appointment of a Commissioner General for Total Mobilization in order to adapt life to all the requirements of total war. This Commissioner General may adapt all public gatherings to the total war and ensure that armed forces and military preparations are not affected by human resources. In addition, it is planned to review railway, postal, and other public agencies and public construction sites again, seeking to save a large amount of personnel. Various activities that are not very necessary for the implementation of the war will be restricted, or blocked, or their organization and methods will be simplified, in order to supply the armed forces and military industry with the maximum amount of human resources.

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Dr. Goebbels, the German Commissioner General for Total Mobilization, broadcast to the nation on the 26th, clarifying the specific program of emergency measures. After being granted extraordinary full powers by the Head of State, Dr. Goebbels expects the German people's public and private lives to be simplified, that is, commerce, transportation, public gatherings, cultural life, etc. will be reorganized. When Dr. Goebbels served as the Defense Commander of Berlin, he implemented all appropriate measures with a small number of subordinates and staff members under repeated bombing by the anti-Axis powers. After Dr. Goebbels takes office as the Commissioner General, he will surely carry out major tasks with a small number of elite doctrines. The German people also keenly feel that it is necessary to strengthen domestic affairs. Newspapers have also been emphasizing the necessity of total mobilization for days. After the announcement of the extraordinary policies of Head of State Hitler, the people of the whole country have the will to fight to the end and stand up to cooperate in overcoming the national crisis.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: What measures will the German government take to strengthen military operations? This is the main question that people in Berlin are currently discussing. German newspaper commentary shows that Germany will establish a strong reserve army. A German official spokesman mentioned yesterday the internal mobilization of the German people to seek strict measures for victory. When asked whether German foreign policy will become more active after the recent developments, the answer was that German foreign policy has always been active. The international relations between Germany and its allies in Southeast Europe are particularly close. They often exchange opinions and adjust their steps. Germans firmly believe that military can win. It would be a misunderstanding to think that if military conditions are deemed unfavorable, politics must be placed above military affairs. When asked whether Germany's allies will also take measures to strengthen domestic activities, the answer was that Germany has always been the leader of its allies in terms of war steps. Facts will soon prove that Germany's new measures can encourage allies to rise up and follow suit.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - During the Munich talks, General Beck, Chief of Staff of the German Army, and a few other German generals, dissatisfied with the Nazi Party's guidance on the war, had the idea of assassinating Head of State Hitler. On the 20th of this month, Colonel Stauffenberg of the Army General Staff took the opportunity to visit the headquarters and placed a time bomb under the carpet of the conference room. The bomb exploded at about 1 p.m. on the 20th, but the Head of State suffered burns and injuries, which were not important. Mr. Berger, the Head of State's typist, died shortly after being seriously injured. General Koten, Chief of Staff of the German Air Force, and Major General Brandt, the former Chief of Staff of the German Army Operations Headquarters, died one after another on the 23rd after suffering serious injuries.

Afterwards, according to photos published by a German newspaper, the exploded conference room was almost completely destroyed. All walls and pillars were destroyed, and chairs and tables were broken. Real household glass flew around. At the same time, the German Head of State's camp feared that some domestic communication agencies were occupied by the rebels, so four hours after the incident, at 5:40 p.m., the course of events was announced. At the same time, the reactionaries propagandized that Head of State Hitler had been bombed to death. In response to this, the Head of State personally broadcast to the nation late at night on the 20th, indicating that the Head of State was unharmed. Admiral Nitz also made a broadcast speech, severely criticizing the misconduct and expressing full central sincerity to the Head of State.</p>

Donovan was the one who designed Roosevelt's invasion of Africa in 1940 and had long talks with General Weygand in Algiers. It is not yet known whether Donovan hopes to find a second Darlan in Madrid this time. Neutral parties believe that Donovan and Spellman were both ordered by Roosevelt to seek an advantage in his next talks with Churchill.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The weak German defenders of Roblin fought to the last bullet before ceasing resistance. The city was besieged by Soviet troops for many days, and now Soviet troops have advanced towards the Rosla River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: On the Eastern Front, the war on the southern flank spread to the outposts of the Carpathian Mountains on Monday, where the Red Army resisted or contained the powerful Soviet offensive in the Stanislav district. The Limburg district was also the site of a major battle again, with German troops firmly holding their lines everywhere. The pressure from the enemy against the Yaroslav district and the north bank of the San River became increasingly intense. On Monday evening, after fierce fighting, the enemy established several small bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river. The offensive operation launched by the German army in the center of the road northwest of Brest-Litovsk the day before went very smoothly. German mechanized units and armored units attacked the Bug River and swept away several enemy bridgeheads. Northeast of Kaunas, particularly fierce fighting occurred.

<p>According to the second announcement on the night of the 20th, the mastermind of the conspiracy committed suicide after the plan failed. General Beck has been executed. This incident has been largely resolved. The despicable plan of the rebellious elements has ultimately come to naught. Dr. Schindammann, the German Minister of Information, announced the death of General Beck on the 21st. General Beck was one of Germany's outstanding staff officers and wrote many works on operations. Today, German military leaders such as General Halder were all influenced by the General. However, due to his opposition to the Anti-Comintern Pact, he resigned in August 1938 after Ribbentrop took office as Foreign Minister. Due to the above reasons, some people have widely publicized the background of this incident. However, due to the German government's lightning measures, Germany has remained extremely calm. On the contrary, it believes that the Head of State's escape from disaster was due to divine protection, so the will to fight has become stronger. In Berlin, troops were dispatched in the city center for about six hours on the evening of the 20th, and machine guns were set up at key locations in the city. It was prepared for German troops to block traffic, which was quite tense for a while. Occasionally, it seemed like searching people's homes, but pedestrians on the street were still talking and laughing freely with the security forces. Since the 21st, Germany has become peaceful.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Bulgaria Strictly Maintains Neutrality Under Soviet Pressure, German Troops Withdraw from Bulgarian Territory <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 26th (Central News Agency) – With the understanding of the German government, the Bulgarian government is said to have established the following two policies: 1. Strictly maintain neutrality in the war between Bulgaria and the Soviet Union; 2. Adjust diplomatic relations with the Turkish government. Bulgaria's establishment of this policy is not a sign of breaking away from the Axis camp, but a shift in diplomatic policy based on the understanding of the German government. Due to the recent progress of the Eastern Front war, the Soviet Union's policy of oppression against Bulgaria has gradually intensified. Germany, based on the overall war situation, has had to transfer valuable troops to other fronts. At the same time, in order to alleviate Soviet oppression, it recognizes Bulgaria's policy of strict neutrality. Based on the change in the situation, the main defense forces of the ports of Varna and Burgas on the Black Sea coast have recently been handed over from German troops to Bulgarian troops, and the blackout control and security in the area have been lifted.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Subtle Response to Soviet Demands <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to an Associated Press report from Ankara: The Soviet government threatened the Bulgarian government, demanding that German troops quickly withdraw from Bulgaria's naval and air bases, otherwise it would declare war on Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government was forced to acknowledge this in principle. A report from Sofia said that with the consent of the German government, the Bulgarian government gave a subtle response to the Soviet Union's request to set up consulates in Varna and Burgas, and requested the Soviet government as follows: 1. A considerable period of hesitation should be given to the conditions required by the Soviet government; 2. Communist propaganda should be stopped in Bulgaria. It is reported that the Soviet Embassy in Sofia has expressed a more favorable attitude towards this attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Growing Friendship Between Turkey and Bulgaria <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Bulgaria's and Turkey's rapprochement is indeed based on the support of the German government, but on the one hand, it is also due to the Soviet Union's oppression of the Turkish government that makes it easier for Turkey and Bulgaria to approach each other. The establishment of the Turkish-Bulgarian trade agreement a few days before the US and British economic sanctions against Turkey can also be said to be one of the reasons for promoting the Turkish-Bulgarian rapprochement. In short, in reality, the Bulgarian government is using Turkey to prevent the invasion of the anti-Axis forces, while the Turkish government can strengthen the tendency of its own neutrality by cooperating with the neutralized Bulgarian government, in order to avoid and reject the demands of the Soviet, American, and British groups to participate in the war.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency, military report: On Tuesday morning, the British Second Army concentrated an unprecedented amount of material resources and launched a large-scale offensive on a small position south and southeast of Caen. The ferocity of the offensive increased on the same day. The German side had anticipated this offensive and made careful preparations, so the counterattack was very successful. The British army only formed a gap in one place in the German position, the deepest point of which was 3.5 kilometers (between Saint-Ainter and Pogab). Northeast of Height 88 south of Mezo Angoni, the British army was blocked by the counterattacking German army. The German army still secured the Caen-Falaise highway, which passes through the Ona River to the first US defense area. The British army has not been able to change its line. The US army's attack on the eastern wing of the Cotentin Peninsula has also developed into a large-scale offensive, but it has made very little progress in a narrow area. The German army is currently launching a major counterattack.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Trends of Naval Strategy <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Ling Qiu</p>
<p>The American navy, which occupies Saipan Island, is boastfully exaggerating. They proclaim that it is as easy as turning one's hand to have the American navy land on the Chinese mainland and advance on the Japanese mainland. But comparing the places the British and Americans have lost since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War with the places they have now recovered, the current situation is merely like a single hair from nine oxen. Can we then exaggerate that naval operations are approaching victory? This is merely the reconstruction of a fragmented and incomplete fleet that suffered a preemptive strike from the Japanese navy at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. There is nothing surprising. This situation was already known before the war began.</p>
<p>Islands or Warships?</p>
<p>The German war theorist Clausewitz once said that because war is a means of pursuing national policy, the purpose of armed combat, which is a part of war, "is to induce a state in which the enemy people consider making peace more advantageous than continuing the war." Therefore, the purpose of naval operations is to control the largest and widest communication route on Earth—the ocean; to manage and dominate traffic and communication on the ocean, to inflict fatal blows on the enemy's politics, military, economy, and ideology, and to destroy its function. Obtaining this control of the sea is the main purpose of naval operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, if someone believes the American navy's boast that occupying Saipan Island is a decisive victory in naval operations, it is truly a laughable misunderstanding. Occupying an island results in advancing the base of the fleet and aircraft. Therefore, no matter which island is occupied, it also gains control of the sea within two or three thousand kilometers of its vicinity. But if the Japanese fleet were to mobilize, drive out the American fleet, and recapture the island, this control of the sea would vanish like a bubble. Even Nimitz acknowledges: "The Japanese fleet is still completely intact." In this situation, how can the capture of Saipan Island be exaggerated as a victory in naval operations?</p>
<p>To gain control of the sea, there is no other way to grasp the necessary methods and means of controlling the sea other than to annihilate the enemy's main fleet.</p>
<p>Maneuvering or Decisive Battle?</p>
<p>Annihilating the enemy's main fleet, which is the main purpose of naval operations, is not easy. This was true not only in this war but also in the Russo-Japanese War. For example, in the famous battle of February 1904, various methods were used against the enemy's Far East Fleet's base, Port Arthur, including night raids, shelling, blockades, and mine attacks, followed by blocking the port, but these methods could not destroy the enemy fleet. Especially on August 10, the enemy's Far East Fleet, which had launched a major offensive, was intercepted and defeated on the ocean, resulting in the victory of the Battle of the Yellow Sea. However, victory in this auxiliary operation was not enough to ensure true control of the sea. Only after defeating the Russian main fleet, which had traveled a long distance from the Baltic Sea, could Japan secure victory.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Admiral Kamimura, commander of the Japanese Second Fleet, suffered from a stone-throwing incident at his countryside residence, troubled by the public's misunderstanding.</p>
<p>It is foolish to be easily worried or delighted by the trends of auxiliary operations in naval operations. If the enemy advances on Saipan Island, it is a good thing for Japan if it can take advantage of this opportunity to implement a gradual reduction operation of the fleet. Japan also calls this a bleeding tactic. If it can gradually cause the collapse of the enemy fleet, it can be said that it has fully accomplished the purpose of auxiliary operations.</p>
<p>A Decisive Battle?</p>
<p>Compared to the Russo-Japanese War, naval operations in the Greater East Asia War have significant differences in the following aspects:</p>
<p>First, the vastness of the battlefield. The main battlefield of naval operations in the Russo-Japanese War was limited to the Yellow Sea and the Sea of Japan. However, the Greater East Asia War takes place in the world's largest ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and a large part of the Indian Ocean. Strategic areas are scattered in all directions, and naval forces are also dispersed and deployed in all directions. As a result, it is very difficult to obtain an opportunity to concentrate both sides' forces to hold a decisive battle of the main fleets.</p>
<p>Second, due to the development of modern weapons such as aircraft, submarines, and radio detectors, the nature of maritime operations has changed. In the era of the Russo-Japanese War, naval battles only used surface ships, but now they have added aerial battles and underwater battles, becoming three-dimensional. As a result, because aircraft can use their speed to attack the enemy fleet before it enters the decisive battle, a true fleet decisive battle becomes difficult to achieve. Furthermore, due to the appearance of radio detectors, fleet movements can be detected from tens of thousands of miles away. Therefore, a fleet that knows the movements of the enemy fleet beyond the line of sight and is unfavorable for a decisive battle can avoid it in advance, making a fleet decisive battle even more impossible.</p>
<p>Third, the United States is different from Russia during the Russo-Japanese War. There is no fatal upheaval in politics, economy, or ideology, and there is no desire for an early decisive battle to save the rampant anti-war and war-weariness thoughts and the deepening of domestic unrest. Therefore, a fleet decisive battle cannot be realized quickly.</p>
<p>What is Maneuver Warfare?</p>
<p>However, what should be noted here is that the movements of the American navy have become apparent. That is the American navy's maneuver warfare since this spring. For example, why did the American navy dare to penetrate deep into the Japanese navy's inner line and carry out landing operations on Saipan Island and Omiya Island (Guam)? On the one hand, the American government authorities, because they wanted to give a good impression to the wavering American people in the upcoming elections, and seek a favorable development of the war situation, cannot hide their anxiety. On the other hand, we must think about the dream of Rear Admiral Mahan, who established the basic strategy of the American navy.</p>
<p>According to Mahan's tactics: "If you want to constantly hold control of the sea, you should maintain local superiority and always attack the enemy." By forming the Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force with more than ten battleships and more than twenty aircraft carriers, and advancing on the isolated island of Saipan, their intention is to pursue Mahan's dream. Mahan said: "To defeat the enemy fleet and ensure control of the sea, you should attack the place the enemy considers most urgent, so that the enemy fleet is forced into a state where it cannot avoid rescue, and intercept it on the ocean you desire."</p>
<p>The American fleet thought that Saipan Island was the most urgent place for Japan, and while urgently attacking it, on the other hand, they wanted to intercept the mobilization of the Japanese fleet, prepare the most desirable posture, and stand ready. In response, the Crystal Japanese Combined Fleet only sent a part of it to attack, launched a preemptive strike by aircraft, achieved great results, and made the gradual reduction operation successful, while at the same time, making Mahan's dream vanish like a bubble.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a misunderstanding by the American naval authorities, thinking that the isolated island of Saipan, which has no large airport or sufficient military port facilities, is an important place for Japan, leading to this situation. However, the excellence of the Japanese navy's strategy of cautiously advancing towards final victory cannot but be admired.</p>
<p>But what about Omiya Island? Regarding this question, it is planned to temporarily remain silent and leave it to the readers to consider.</p>
<p>What are the Conditions for a Decisive Battle?</p>
<p>Summarizing the above discussion, it can be summarized into two questions, namely, to what extent will the Japanese fleet tolerate the American mobile fleet's clumsy movements, and where will the decisive battle take place?</p>
<p>Here, it is impossible not to think that, as with army operations, terrain is also an important factor in naval operations.</p>
<p>Before World War I, when Germany was striving to build a strong fleet to promote its world policy, the British Naval Minister Churchill ridiculed: "Your naval fleet alone cannot be called naval power. Your world policy is like standing on clay." Indeed, in World War I, the German navy was prevented from launching an attack on the main battlefield, the Atlantic Ocean, and could only operate in the secondary battlefields of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. This was the result of Germany focusing solely on organizing the fleet and forgetting another element of naval power: strategic terrain. Terrain is so important in maritime operations.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of so-called strategic terrain in naval operations?</p>
<p>First, it has a connection to a suitable naval base. The reason why the American navy did not directly advance on Saipan Island from Hawaii, but spent a great deal of sacrifice occupying small islands such as Makin and Tarawa, can be said to be to obtain a naval base. Occupying Saipan Island can also be seen as building a naval base.</p>
<p>Second, we must be on the inner line, while the enemy is on the outer line. At necessary locations and at necessary times, we can always concentrate superior forces and make a preemptive strike, giving us a grasp of victory.</p>
<p>Moreover, inner-line operations have the advantage of being safe and rapid because the rear communication and transportation routes are short and convenient. The major reasons for the Japanese army's withdrawal from Guadalcanal Island and the German army's shortening of the front line from Moscow were also due to the overextended supply lines.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, which country's navy occupies the advantage of the inner line, and which country's navy is troubled by maintaining an overextended supply line, please open the map and study it. The American Fifth-Eighth Mobile Force claims that it can continue to operate away from its base for several weeks. However, studying the distances traveled across the Pacific Ocean reveals that there are great limitations in operations. But saying more would be a strategic secret. The fleet decisive battleground that determines the rise and fall of Japan and the United States, where it is advantageous to Japan, cannot be explicitly stated. This matter can even be said to concern the future of ten billion people in East Asia. Please imagine it yourself!</p>
<p>Especially today, with the development of aircraft, being able to have large aircraft with long flight times and carrying large amounts of bombs participate in naval battles from land bases is the best condition. Han sees this condition and cannot consider a fleet decisive battle. Regarding this point, the American military authorities will say that aircraft carriers have mobility and attack power and are excellent.</p>
<p>However, aircraft carriers can carry about a hundred large aircraft, and only a few dozen small ones. If they encounter the Japanese air force's divine-skill dive bombing, they will be sunk in an instant. Therefore, the American navy's words are nothing more than propaganda to justify the weak state of the American navy, whose ships have been occupied by Japan on many islands.</p>
<p>Where are they Coming?</p>
<p>American General Nimitz, who occupied Saipan Island, once claimed that because the Japanese fleet is still intact, he expects that there will still be several fierce battles in the future, but he still boasted that it would be as easy as turning one's hand for the American navy to advance north to the Japanese mainland or land west on the Chinese mainland. But in reality, they neither went north nor went west, but instead launched a landing operation on Miyako Island again from the 21st. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how small the strategic position of the Cold Class Island is beyond their expectations, and how difficult it is to operate outside the Mariana Islands. This illustrates the insecurity of the American military's extended supply line. However, what cannot be ignored here is that Japan, in the inner-line camp, although it is said to have a sea area where it firmly holds control of the sea, it cannot be asserted that it is impossible for the American navy to pass through in terms of time and space.</p>
<p>Control of the sea is not building an iron wall on the sea. It is also not setting a sphere of influence with a solid iron lock, preventing the enemy from approaching even one step. The battlefield is a vast and unlimited continent without mountains, valleys, rivers, or roads, and its sphere of influence is at most only to the extent that it does not allow free movement. Therefore, its effect is not absolutely fixed, but rather a relative thing that is inevitably somewhat fluctuating in time and space. This is similar to control of the air. The airspace over Shanghai is completely under Japan's control of the air, and it is absolutely impossible for enemy aircraft to fly freely. But to say that not even one aircraft is allowed to invade is impossible due to the nature of the sky and the performance of aircraft.</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the American military occupies Saipan Island, lands on Omiya Island, and bombs the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, retaliation is not absolutely impossible. As long as the Japanese navy is still completely intact, and the victory is believed to be about Japan, then the East Asian nation...</p>
<p>Where will the American military attack? When the American military attacks where, will the Japanese fleet mobilize to challenge the suckling? This is still unclear. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, once instructed in his lecture on Greater Asia: "If the nine hundred million residents of Asia unite and respond in unison, they will definitely not be defeated by the four hundred million minority of Europe."</p>

<h3 id="e36">Consultative Committee Exchanges Opinions with Police Bureau on Improving Police Administration; Relevant Heads Answer Questions Separately <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Consultative Committee recently reported that various reports indicated that various problems in security need to be improved. In order to exchange opinions sincerely, the Committee held a symposium with the relevant department heads of the First Police Bureau at 4 p.m. on the 25th (previous day) at the First District Park. Those present included Wu Song, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Zhao Yaoqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Bin, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Riping, and Shen Siliang, standing members of the Consultative Committee, and Su Chengde, Deputy Director of the First Police Bureau, Sun Lifu, Chief Secretary, Li Shiyu, Director of the Judicial Department, Lu Qi, Director of the Virtue Administration Department, Gu Gangwu, Director of the Baojia Department, Goshima Shigeru, Director of the Special High Department and concurrently Director of the Economic Security Department, who was unable to attend due to illness, and Zhao Jinqing explained the purpose of the reception, and put forward suggestions for improving four issues. The responsible department heads answered each item separately as follows:</p>
<p>Measures to Improve Residence Permit Renewal</p>
<p>1.  Improve the procedure for renewing residence permits: Each Lianbao office should handle the process separately to avoid men, women, old, and young having to go to the police station to queue in shifts. For a portion of socially prestigious and high-status individuals, consider a method of affixing a necessary seal, without requiring complete fingerprinting, to suit our national customs.</p>
<p>Director Gu of the Baojia Department replied: The procedure for renewing residence permits is based on the revised Sino-Japanese Exchange of Notes of 1942 and 1943. The friendly army handed over the responsibility to the police station. The police station is not allowed to transfer the responsibility to the Baojia. This department referred to the central government's methods and formulated the "Notice on the Renewal of Residence Permits in Shanghai," which has been published in newspapers and stipulates very detailed regulations. There are also flexible measures for those who cannot go to the police station in person. Within the scope possible now, the procedures are simplified as much as possible, and personnel are sent to various bureaus to supervise improvements, in order to provide convenience to the people. As for the fingerprinting issue, it was originally only stipulated that officials above the rank of central government commissioner could be exempted from fingerprinting. In order to suit our national customs and habits, this department has forwarded a request to the central government to allow the use of seals instead of fingerprints. However, since it concerns laws and regulations, a clear order must be awaited. Incidentally, the Baojia fines have been stopped, and there will be unified regulations for Baojia fees.</p>
<p>Organize Self-Defense Corps in Factories</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the organization of special self-defense corps in factories: The police bureau and the factories should cooperate closely to ensure that production is not hindered. The attitude of police supervision should be improved to avoid difficulties for the factories.</p>
<p>Director Goshima of the Special Department and concurrently Director of the Economic Security Department replied: The purpose of organizing special self-defense corps in factories is to enable each factory to have adequate precautions in order to protect production operations. Men aged 16 to 50 do not need to be completely on guard duty, but should jointly assume the responsibility of guarding. The factories can divide the work and arrange for a small number of people to take turns on duty. If there are misunderstandings in police supervision, treating them as ordinary self-defense corps on guard duty, we are now assigning higher-ranking police chiefs and others to handle this, and have strictly ordered them to improve their attitude.</p>
<p>Matters Related to the Inspection of Weights and Measures</p>
<p>Director Lu of the Administrative Department: Regarding the use of weights and measures, if there are dishonest police officers who make things difficult for merchants transporting materials, taking advantage or cheating in the process, this bureau does not conduct inspections at will. Sometimes, we only go for inspection after receiving a report and having evidence. If a violation is found, we will send it to the prosecutor's office according to proper procedures. For minor offenses, we will impose fines. From now on, we will carefully investigate and supervise the handling of cases by various sub-bureaus.</p>
<p>Police Officers Making Things Difficult for Material Transport</p>
<p>3. Regarding the issue of police officers along the way creating difficulties in the transport of materials: Materials that are allowed to be transported freely according to regulations should not be restricted and should be facilitated. Traffic police should limit their duties and not interfere beyond their scope. If any police officer is found to be involved in such matters, they should be severely punished.</p>
<p>Director Goshima replied: Inspecting the transport of materials is the responsibility of the economic police. Except for illegal goods and controlled goods, other ordinary special goods do not require a certificate. They can be transported freely within the city without any restrictions. If ordinary police on the streets have overstepped their bounds, we will step up patrols.</p>
<p>Director Lu replied: Traffic police should not interfere with materials. We have issued repeated orders, but because there are too many, we cannot correct them immediately. We hope that people from all walks of life will assist in reporting so that we can take effective measures.</p>
<p>Director Yao of the Supervisory Department replied: If police officers have violated regulations, they will be severely punished without leniency. We hope that citizens will jointly monitor them and report the facts, time, location, and police number to the bureau in secret so that we can take disciplinary action.</p>
<p>Six Questions Regarding Police Administration</p>
<p>Subsequently, Chen Bin raised six questions: Do ordinary police receive training regularly? What is the current training situation for new police? Has the "tipster" system from the previous patrol room era been improved? Have the judicial procedures of the various sub-bureaus been improved compared to before? Are there regulations for fines on various roads? How is their use allocated? Has the Supervisory Department improved compared to the previous patrol room era? Deputy Director Su and the relevant department heads explained separately. Regarding the first and second questions, the police bureau currently has two police training centers, one on Yulin Road and one at Dapu Bridge. The original regulations and systems of the two places were different, but they have now been merged and unified. The training of new police and the re-education of old police are equally emphasized, and are divided into judicial, Baojia, special high, and administrative classes. The main points of the curriculum are divided into three categories: A. Spiritual training, B. Academic training, C. Technical training. As for the police on duty, general training is also implemented. Each day, the bureau issues training points for attention, which are explained by the bureau chiefs and police officers of each sub-bureau. Soon, after the merger of the first and second police bureaus in this city, more emphasis will be placed on the implementation of general education. At the same time, special attention will be paid to improving the lives of the police, advancing both spiritually and materially, and creating a new and good police force.</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of the judicial procedures and the absence of the "tipster" system from the previous patrol room era, Director Li Shiyu of the Judicial Department explained: The judicial systems of the patrol rooms of the International Settlement and the French Concession have always been different. Since the merger of this bureau with the Third Police Bureau and the West Police Bureau, a unified judicial system has been established. A judicial department is set up in the headquarters, adopting a centralized duty and scattered deployment system. A judicial section is set up in each sub-bureau, subject to the command and supervision of the sub-bureau chief. The review and guidance of its work is managed by the judicial department. As for the lack of training for judicial police in the past, a judicial police training class has been established in the past six months. In addition to imparting legal knowledge, (tipsters) who have also received the above-mentioned training number more than sixty. Currently, there are plans to improve the level of detectives, and it is planned to recruit a number of university graduates to teach them relevant judicial police knowledge, so that the quality of detectives can be improved and the society can be made safe.</p>
<p>Regarding the police fines, Director Lu Qi of the Administrative Department explained that they are handled in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Interior. The police bureau notifies the person fined in writing, and the fine is submitted to the Finance Department of the First Public Office for verification and entry into the treasury.</p>
<p>Regarding the insufficient number of personnel in the Supervisory Department, the supervisory spirit has not been fully exerted, but the inspectors work day and night, striving to clarify the police atmosphere and benefit the society.</p>
<p>Finally, the standing members of the Municipal Consultative Committee explained in detail the various issues raised today, hoping that the authorities would earnestly improve them. Chen Bin expressed his deep admiration for the efforts of the officials of the police administration to promote improvements. He hoped that the police administration authorities would strictly monitor and report unqualified police officers, whether they are from this country or friendly countries, and that the police training aspect would focus on ideological training. The Committee will do its best to assist in improving the living conditions and treatment of the police. They exchanged opinions sincerely, lasting for three hours, and the meeting ended at seven o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Advancing Operations on One Front, Actively Building on Another: Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Current Situation in Hunan <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Allied Shanghai - Minister Izubuchi of the Car Reporting Department, who recently made a special trip to inspect the front lines in Hunan, beginning a few days ago, held the department's regular reporting conference at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). Minister Izubuchi personally attended, along with Akahoshi [name obscured]. He met with Chinese news reporters from this city and, on the spot, Minister Izubuchi gave the following speech regarding his observations from his inspection of the Hunan front:</p>
<p>Situation in Hengyang</p>
<p>Minister Izubuchi first stated: This time, I went to the Hunan front to inspect the general conditions in the peaceful zones under the occupation of the Japanese army. Regarding Hengyang, a portion has been occupied by Japanese troops. Since the 15th of this month, even more vigorous and fierce attacks have been launched, and they have advanced along the banks of the Xiang River. The situation is quite favorable, and they have already reached Taizi Wharf, a corner of the city of Hengyang. On the morning of the 21st of this month, the Japanese army also launched a fierce attack on the Yu Xueyue's [Chinese commander] reinforcements sent to Hengyang. They intercepted them in the west of Hengyang from the south, and another Japanese army coming from the south also intercepted that army in the west of Hengyang. Therefore, the current Yu Xueyue's reinforcements are being attacked from both sides and are powerless in this situation. Also, around the 20th of this month, the Japanese 50th Army, which had advanced south from [obscured name], utterly annihilated the defeated troops. In addition, the Japanese army in the Chaling area has also annihilated the defeated troops of Yu's 37th Army, who fled into the western mountains, and on the 22nd, they advanced to Anren. In short, the defeated Yu troops around Hengyang have become [obscured text], unable to regroup and destined for annihilation. Their complete elimination is simply a matter of time.</p>
<p>People Returning</p>
<p>Minister Izubuchi continued: Regarding the highway from Yuezhou to Hengyang, and the highway from Yuezhou to Changsha, most of them were destroyed by the Yu troops when they fled. Especially the [obscured text] between Yuezhou and Changsha, it's quite difficult. However, the Japanese army, while advancing operations on one front, is also actively engaged in construction on the other. With rapid engineering, they have been gradually repairing them, gaining no small amount of help. The Japanese army has put considerable effort and painstaking care into restoring the transportation routes, and the villagers near each road under repair are contributing everything to the Japanese army and are willing to cooperate, thus gaining considerable help in the restoration work. Secondly, in [obscured text] near Changsha, local people have been returning one after another, reflecting the progress in security and construction, and the number of returning people is increasing daily, with a maximum of about 1,100 people per day. As for the situation in the city, although general big stores have not recovered, ordinary stores have gradually resumed business, and there are quite a few new shops set up by Japanese residents, so it is believed that the city will be bright and prosperous in the short term. When Changsha launched the operation, the residents of the area took refuge, but not far away, all taking refuge in nearby villages, living a relatively stable life. This time, when they returned to their hometowns, it was extremely simple, and the Japanese army there, in both its combat operations and construction activities, followed the instructions of the top commander, reassuring the local people deeply. They diligently read and copied the Japanese army's top commander's proclamation of peace, and told it to the general Chinese populace, so the people there trust the Japanese army deeply and cooperate sincerely.</p>
<p>Stable Life</p>
<p>Regarding the situation, farmers are planting rice with peace of mind, and the green fields in the suburbs are a sign of a bountiful year. Therefore, with the gradual restoration of construction and security, the original appearance has been largely restored, and it is believed that after this autumn, it will be even brighter, with a new posture of rebirth. At the same time, the price of rice there is very low, only 1,300 yuan, which is only a little more than one-tenth of the highest rice price in Shanghai. Since Hunan has been occupied by the Japanese army, each area has been transformed from "resistance" to a peaceful zone, and all facilities are more brilliant than in the past. The villagers are all delighted, and because of the continuous inhumane and barbaric behavior of the American air force in Chongqing, they constantly harass and scout, and even blindly bomb unimportant villages. Although there is not much damage, the innocent harm to civilians makes the local people despise them even more.</p>
<p>Smooth Supply</p>
<p>Finally, Izubuchi explained in detail that the shortening of the supply line and the opening of the extended battle line are of great value, and make the operation [obscured text]. Therefore, the communication of the supply line to shorten the distance is not only beneficial to the operation, but also more smooth and unobstructed. However, the enemy Americans in the South Pacific strategy [obscured text], we estimate that they [obscured text] in the overall war situation has been extremely unfavorable, its own in terms of terrain, such as the supply line [obscured text] drag on, its operations more difficult [obscured text].</p>

<p>After the reorganization and establishment of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, it has now, in accordance with the immediately stipulated measures for the unified purchase and distribution of flour and wheat, designated purchasing merchants to [obscured text] Chinese and Japanese agents to launch wheat purchasing work in various regions within Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces and the two special municipalities of Beijing and [obscured text]. Before the issue of the association borrowing funds from the Sino-Japanese Bank is resolved, all funds for purchasing wheat will be temporarily advanced by the purchasing merchants and interest paid retroactively. As for the purchase price of wheat, it has now been fully determined, but the purchase price of wheat in each region is slightly different. The purchase price of wheat is determined according to the level of commodity prices and the ratio of farmers' lives in each wheat-producing area to determine a reasonable standard price. Therefore, it is expected that this purchase work will be smoother than in the past, and the purchase quantity and performance will exceed the quantity taken in last year, which will benefit the assistance of people's food [obscured text].</p>

<h3 id="e41">Dance Halls and Electricity Saving <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The power supply in this city will be universally restricted again starting next month. The operation of trams will also reduce vehicles and frequency. The reason for the power restriction is the shortage of coal supply, which is a problem of insufficient raw materials, and can also be said to be a passive and unavoidable measure. While we hope that the authorities will do their best to transport coal, we have no choice but to hope that electricity can be rationally adjusted again.</p>
<p>How to adjust it? Production should not be reduced or reduced as little as possible. Living consumption (such as telecommunications, electric irons, refrigerators, etc.) and entertainment venues, etc., should be reduced to a minimum or absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>Dance halls are one of the entertainment venues, which should not exist at all in this time of war, and the fact that dance halls of all sizes are standing tall and still thriving is already incredible. Since the last power restriction, each dance hall was ordered not to prepare for business after 11 o'clock. However, it is heard that there are still several dance halls in the western district that are still open until 4 o'clock in the morning, which is a clear violation of the law. Why doesn't the Shanghai West Police Department crack down on them? If it is said that the dance hall has been specially approved to operate overtime, it is not known on what legal basis the competent authorities have granted it special approval.</p>
<p>In this repeated call for electricity saving, we hope that these unreasonable phenomena will be quickly eliminated and quickly [obscured].</p>

<p>Director of the Japanese side [obscured text] Reporting Department, Colonel Matsushima [obscured name], published an article entitled "The Autumn of the Great East Asia's Total Rise." He expresses his heroic fighting spirit from the perspective of a naval officer. The main points of the original text are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>The enemy unexpectedly made a major issue of this change of the Japanese cabinet and proclaimed that the Pacific war situation was about to end. Their reasons included: [1] The Tojo Cabinet [obscured text] was responsible for the Pacific war situation, [2] Japan would lose the war [obscured text] and organize a new cabinet to begin peace work. However, there is still a part who say that the Japanese new cabinet's policy direction has not changed, and they are warned about the above statements.</p>
<p>Looking at the enemy's intentions, they are nothing more than using political and military strategies to launch a fierce attack on Japan, and especially emphasizing ideological warfare [obscured text]. We are against this covert operation, [obscured text] the achievements [obscured text] the essence [obscured text]. The character of this Japanese new cabinet is that it [obscured text] shares life and death, it is really the crystallization of the red war. Japan [obscured text] will therefore solidify [obscured text] the state of vigorous rise, and complete the [obscured text] situation since history, especially the spirit of cooperation between the army and navy, has been fully demonstrated. It is believed that no matter [obscured text] any difficulties, we will definitely move towards victory. Now that the Divine Land has reached the dawn, it is when we are about to enter the decisive battle scene. We must rise in certain death, and if we are in a dead place, there is nothing we cannot [obscured text]. In short, today is the time for us to suddenly move forward.</p>

<p>In order to unify the municipal police administration, the authorities previously established the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Office, with Mayor Chen concurrently serving as the director, to handle all police matters. Now, the First and Second Police Bureaus have been ordered to merge and establish the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau on August 1. Therefore, the existence of the former Police Office is no longer necessary. It will also be abolished on August 1. Hereafter, the city's police administration will be unified under the jurisdiction and management of the bureau, in order to achieve unification.</p>
<p>Two Training Centers Merge</p>
<p>In order to cultivate new police officers, the First Police Bureau of this city has established the Yulin Road Training Center and the Model Police Training Center. In order to unify the educational affairs, the two training centers have been merged to establish the First Police Bureau Training Center, specializing in police training and education. Hereafter, all police training such as judicial, special higher moral administration [obscured text] will be handled by the center. The position of director is still held concurrently by Deputy Director Su Chengde, and Hong Hanbao is appointed as deputy director. As for the heads of various sections, personnel have also been adjusted and have begun handling matters.</p>

I have received the scholarship from your newspaper for the previous three semesters. I have completed the university program this semester. I am extremely grateful and remember my roots. At this time, when prices are rising daily and it is increasingly difficult to make a living, the number of parents who cannot afford their children's tuition will inevitably increase, then how many more will be lost to education? I have suffered from the pain of being unable to attend school in the past. Whenever I think of this, I am ashamed, but I am forced by economic conditions, and I can only sigh helplessly! Recently, I have repeatedly seen your newspaper publishing "Reader Scholarship News," which makes me [obscured].

<h3 id="e50">Lack of Draft Cattle in Rural Areas: Difficulty in Irrigating <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, in rural villages, out of every ten households, four households would own draft cattle, which they would hire out in turns, enough to maintain the work of drawing water. However, today, because they are forced by life, they have almost sold all the draft cattle they depend on. In our hometown of Pudong, because of the lack of draft cattle, each head of cattle has to cultivate more than 60 *mu*, which is really not enough to rotate. Therefore, 70% to 80% of the rice paddies cannot be irrigated, and the soil in the fields is cracked. If we do not seek salvation and let nature take its course, then the rice seedlings will wither and the autumn harvest will be hopeless. At that time, the losses suffered by the farmers are truly unimaginable. Not to mention anything else, just take soybean cake as an example. At present, each sheet costs 1,150 yuan, and other fertilizer and labor costs are not included. How will the farmers live? Therefore, we urge the authorities to quickly devise countermeasures to rescue the countryside, which is not only the luck of the farmers, but also the future of the people's food.

<h3 id="e51">Suggestions to Prevent Embezzlement by Tram Ticket Sellers <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Although the company authorities have repeatedly tried to improve and stop the problem of tram ticket sellers dipping their hands into the till. However, the practice of dipping hands has not decreased. The fundamental solution, of course, is to ask the company to increase the salary of ticket sellers as much as possible, at least so that they can maintain a minimum standard of living. If there are still embezzlement behaviors after the salary increase, the following countermeasures may be adopted:</p>
<p>Increase the fare. The first three classes are all 5 yuan, but the used first-class discarded tickets can be returned to the ticket office to get back 2 yuan in cash, and the third-class discarded tickets can get back 3 and a half yuan in cash (these discarded tickets can be exchanged for cash at major cigarette and paper shops.)</p>
<p>Regarding the problem of checking tickets on electric vehicles, the company can cooperate with the Baojia Committee, and the members of the self-defense corps near the station have the obligation to check their tickets when passengers get off the bus. Passengers who do not have tickets must purchase them. If a ticket seller is found to have embezzled, his number must be recorded and reported to the tram company for severe punishment. In this way, passengers must have tickets when they get off the bus. The ticket seller will, of course, have no way to use his skills.</p>
<p>Although the price of tickets can be the same, the color of the ticket surface must be different. And the name of the station where the passenger gets off must be indicated on the ticket for inspection and to prevent abuses. (Cai Liyong)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Opinions on "Waste Voucher Sticking Flowers" <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>I read in the National Forum of July 25 that there is a suggestion to use waste voucher stickers to subsidize the education fund. I have a few opinions, which I would like to express as follows:</p>
<p>If damaged legal tender needs to be affixed with flowers, each store will inevitably be picky when accepting legal tender during transactions, and will not accept legal tender that is almost damaged but not yet damaged. What should be done? In the process of transferring payment of legal tender, it is invisibly damaged. If you are not careful, wouldn't you be accepting damage in vain? This is the reason held by the store, which is also correct.</p>
<p>Is the circulation of broken coupons after sticking flowers [obscured]? Both have difficulties. If they are still in circulation, what should be done if the paper quality of the attached printed flowers is damaged again? If it is not in circulation, if citizens have a small amount or a small number to exchange, the value obtained is not enough to cover the cost of transportation, and citizens would rather discard it, resulting in a double loss.</p>
<p>How much of the investigated coupons are received by the National Bank every day must be carefully investigated clearly, so as not to lose more than gain. If the tax rate is too high, citizens will lose more, and there will be more currency in circulation.</p>
<p>To implement waste coupon sticking flowers, the above-mentioned difficulties must be overcome. (Zhong Zuo Zhong Qi)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Science and Technology Symposium <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Bito: Yes. We are proceeding according to this method. If you look at the results of research in various fields, for example, the All-Japan Science and Technology Federation, you will know this when you hear the research results reported. They ask, how can we make our work practical? Anything that can be used is immediately adopted. Let me give you another example, which was decided a few days ago. A certain minister from the Navy, who is engaged in various aspects, said to me, the Navy is engaged in this kind of research, and it seems very useful. According to your opinion, can it be immediately applied to practical work? Since I received a notification ordering me to check whether it is applicable and to give a definite answer, I immediately checked and tested it, and the result was very applicable. Well then, let's adopt it immediately! Let's discuss it with the Ministry of Military Affairs and order the practitioners! This matter has already been in progress for two periods. At least it is a very effective study for enhancing combat power. Hearing that kind of result, we immediately moved it to the production organization within two weeks. In our opinion, at least the conclusions of the research do not require a lot of time and can reach the production organization. Naturally, we will immediately think of ways to contribute to strengthening our power. It is indeed proceeding according to wartime methods. This is the inevitable future for us in the specialized control association, while other enterprises focus on the main future, which is another matter. Generally speaking, modern entrepreneurs often conduct research according to national requirements, so they do not carefully calculate whether it is profitable before applying it to the enterprise. They obey orders, and if the research results are necessary and necessary for the country, then they will produce it, regardless of how much equipment and capital are needed. It is to be implemented after permission, so when specialists estimate that the results of this kind of research have a full possibility of practical application, they will not hesitate and immediately move it to the production organization.</p>
<p>Trial Research Orders and Production Research</p>
<p>Hanada: The simplest work for the Technology Institute is to accept inventions. After receiving them, some are immediately transferred to the military, while simpler ones are immediately ordered to be manufactured with money. For larger-scale projects, trial research orders are issued to start research. At the same time, due to the organizational reform that was eliminated, a new Production Technology Department was born, and production research has also spent a lot of money. Therefore, the object of trial research, or transferred to the hands of entrepreneurs, also needs to be developed and promoted, which is risky, because it may not be produced. All that is necessary for the country must be spent on considerable items for production. The Ministry of Military Affairs' Military Supply Company Bill grants such authority, the so-called pioneering factory, or venture factory, which entrepreneurs are unwilling to do, is constantly produced with government subsidies and assistance. Recently, it has become a controlled economy. It is not easy for an individual to invent something good and want to obtain materials for manufacturing. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible without the government's backing. Or entrepreneurs intend to do it, but the current environment also prevents them from doing so. At the same time, a system has now been established, or entrepreneurs are unwilling to do it, but if it is an important matter, they are forced to do it. We think this range should be like this. To be honest, researching this melodious matter is like sowing seeds and sprouting. Naturally, after sprouting, it will be transplanted to the mountains, but if you think the sprouts have come out and immediately transplant them to the mountains, many will die. All in all, it still needs to be cultivated in the nursery for a considerable period of time. This thing is cultivated in the nursery. Production research should be cultivated in the nursery for a considerable period of time, and only after the branches and leaves have grown strong can it be transplanted to the mountains. In addition, some are not cultivated in the nursery, but are directly cultivated in the mountains. There are still some difficulties in sowing, which are the difficulties for the government. Because it requires a budget and also needs to buy materials. For the larger projects we are researching, we immediately contact the Ministry of Military Affairs or the Army and Navy for trial production. Because everyone is very enthusiastic and the system is not chaotic, everything will definitely go smoothly.</p>
<p>: Regarding what was said just now, what we are researching in the control association, and then using the power of the control association to manufacture it, is insufficient. In addition, there are impossible problems for the control association to do with all its strength, so we have to hand it over to the Technology Institute, and then trial-produce our research, or make it possible to be produced. Generally, the work that technicians do does not ask whether it is for the control association or for the research group, but for the country, everyone should work together.</p>
<p>Inamura: Under such conditions, do the initial researchers have to follow all the way from trial production to final production? Or is it that production has nothing to do with the researchers?</p>
<p>Hanada: Both situations exist.</p>
<p>Inamura: I heard a story from a friend who works in a company that is too拘泥拘泥formalistic, and the research department, trial production department, and production organization have each become independent organizations, so a work is transferred to the trial production department, and then transferred from the trial production department to production. In this case, if the initial researcher follows all the way to the end, the efficiency is very high, and even the smallest details can be noticed. If it is done by someone else, they will not understand the initial researcher's motives and will often arbitrarily change them, resulting in the main point being mistaken, which delays trial production or misses the industrialization deadline, which is inevitable in reality.</p>
<p>Hanada: Recently, we are dealing with a problem, which is to produce resources that Japan does not have from Japanese resources. This is a work that a certain research institute is working hard on. Research began in the summer that was eliminated, and now an answer has already been obtained. This was accepted by the Research Mobilization Conference, and work began after the Research Mobilization Conference. However, this research institute does not have the conditions that a factory should have. Therefore, the previous research of this research institute, after passing the so-called slope, there is only one road left in front. In the industrial aspect, a certain amount of tolerance is required, so you can know that things that were previously biased to the right or left will also be out of line, and materials will also be changed, and production must be carried out according to this purpose. This kind of work is constantly being done in the research institute. Even so, with the people from the research institute as the center, other companies are ordered to carry out production, so all the existing equipment of the factory is used, and additional deficiencies are supplemented, and every moment is raced to move to production as soon as possible. There are still factory problems on this, which is certainly ridiculous, but there are still many unknowns. Then go and work with those who have various factory conditions. Then, with the people from the company as the center, the people from the research institute participate in this place, and at the same time, the company sends people to the research institute to work. The company no longer estimates whether it is profitable or not, and the government subsidizes materials or other items and engages in production. If the research results and items appear once, the Technology Institute will immediately hand them over to the Ministry of Military Affairs.</p>
<p>Ohashi: Now I want to say a few words that are slightly off topic. According to the National Mobilization Law, when the complete collection of trial research is promulgated, although the practitioners spend a huge amount of research funds, the government's rewards are very small, and only the operating expenses and personnel expenses are compensated according to the report submitted to the government. In addition, most factories do not have trial production factories, so they confuse trial products and production products, so that factories that trial-produce too many types will plummet, which is a considerable burden on the enterprise. Therefore, if an enterprise with national significance is not established, it may not be enthusiastic about engaging in trial research. My master believes that the country should have an independent trial production factory. In today's era of few excellent technicians, although trial research orders are issued to many factories, it is difficult to complete the factories, so the reception will be delayed again and again, so I think it is best to mobilize all the excellent technicians to the state's trial production factory. If this kind of trial production factory cannot be realized immediately, at least the excellent technicians from the practitioners should form an organization like a Patriotic Corps. They can help the factories that receive trial research orders at any time. I think this is also possible.</p>
<p>Hanada: During the trial research period, there are also general mobilization trial research orders, and there are also entrusted research that is not so tense. There are also extremely simple forms of entrustment. In addition, there is production research that is no different from a factory, no different from an enterprise. There are naturally various stages in between. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt appropriate placement according to the objective situation. This is an official position, so I think it is very convenient.</p>
<p>The Necessity and Encouragement of Local Improvement</p>
<p>Inamura: Will the Creative Department produce many great results?</p>
<p>Hanada: There have been quite meaningful things. Although I haven't heard everything, those with troublesome procedures haven't encountered resistance, and those who are interested will hand them over to the Army and Navy one by one.</p>
<p>Ohashi: In Germany, in order to organize specialized associations for inventors in cities, efforts are made to corporatize new practical plans. Regarding the issue of raw materials, the practitioners are also rotated to avoid disputes. If a dispute arises, it will be resolved by the arbitration of the association in absentia. The arbitration is composed of officials from the patent bureau, the president of the association, and a director from the same industry as the disputants, three people, so that it can be properly handled.</p>
<p>Inamura: It is enough to make efforts for general things and think that new things can happen. In actual production organizations, meaningful results often come from local improvement movements. In the production organization, the subtle improvements that were previously neglected are said to have achieved good results. Therefore, local improvement is also very meaningful.</p>
<p>Hanada: When local improvements appear, if the quality is good, local improvements can also be guided in a good direction through the bonus system.</p>
<p>Ohashi: The initial policy of rewarding local improvements in production organizations will sometimes grant scholarships to excellent improvements, allowing their children to enter university. Currently, when the fishing industry cannot encourage workers to work hard, the scholarship method is used to incite enthusiasm for the education of children in order to serve the country in the future, which is a good way to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Reporter: What specific methods does the control association take in such situations?</p>
<p>Bito: The control association is proceeding on a small scale. (To be continued) (Ji You Month April Issue Japan Review)</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Trend of Japanese Drama Under the Decisive Battle Stage Oyama Isao <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Full of Nationality</p>
<p>What needs to be said again is the phenomenon of injecting or maintaining nationality and commonality into drama. Originally, drama (of course, not limited to drama) contains nationality and commonality, which is a matter of course, but in the past capitalist or liberal era drama system, it was not like this at all. In fact, it was the opposite. They thought that money could be made, and any script could be performed, even if the script contained toxins to the national spirit. This is this kind of acting attitude, which does not take into account the interests of the country and the nation. The existence of this attitude should not be allowed, even in peacetime, let alone in today's increasingly fierce decisive battle stage, of course, there is no need for any redundant words.</p>
<p>It is this relationship, because the situation is tight, this attitude has gradually begun to be criticized and pointed out. Due to the active control and guidance of the electric bureau, and the self-consciousness of the actors, the past flaws have been gradually eliminated, especially after the implementation of emergency measures, this elimination movement has been strengthened. The establishment and activities of the wandering troupe mentioned earlier have completely changed their previous mistakes. In addition, not long ago, the amateur actor movement of the Welfare Troupe, which was very popular in local rural areas and weaving factories, can also be said to be moving forward in the right direction. Both of these movements deny the individuality and profitability in drama. The purpose of drama is to comfort the people, provide art and defense, promote national policies, and enlighten culture, etc. As for the above-mentioned nationality and commonality, of course, it is also the attitude that drama should have.</p>
<p>Professional Theater Troupes in Large Cities</p>
<p>Regarding this tendency of professional theater troupes in large cities, it has also been gradually strengthened due to control, but this direction is clearly pointed out in the emergency measures order, and they are forcibly required to comply. Today, after the emergency measures, among some people, there is a lot of talk about national management of drama, group management of drama, etc., as well as the establishment of drama strategy companies and drama corps, etc., which clearly proves that they want to take coercive measures.</p>
<p>This issue, especially from today's subjective and objective situation, only deeply feels subtle and difficult, and the related officials have not even issued any active instructions and explanations, but are hovering in a cautious attitude. However, this kind of performing art form is certainly not allowed to continue to exist today, and must be reformed.</p>
<p>National Drama Creation</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the innovation of drama at present. In the positive aspect, it is to create and establish national drama. In the negative aspect, it is to correct the city, Western European, decadent, suppressive, and consumer defects of modern drama. The former was advocated by a foresighted playwright as early as several years ago, and not long ago, Yao Yimingti has become the unanimous request of all playwrights and cultural figures. Now, the government offices centered on the Information Bureau, as well as the cultural organizations of other surrounding groups, have begun to try hard.</p>
<p>In other words, the Information Bureau takes out huge prizes every year to encourage all theater troupes to participate in the national drama competition, and to commend and reward outstanding works. The Japan Cultural Central League has held a prize competition among all groups called various popular dramas, and has also harvested considerable artistic value achievements. These two things comfort the national life and give it supreme spiritual power. The ideology is based on the Japanese worldview, and the art creates excellent dramas with the Japanese classical drama tradition. At the same time, we must also strive to handle political national dramas such as those launched by the Army, Navy, Military Protection Institute, and other government offices to directly improve fighting spirit and increase production.</p>
<p>Adjusting Show Times</p>
<p>The latter is a system in which the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Metropolitan Police Department implement script checks and performance checks. Therefore, it is to prohibit the performance of Western European and American style dramas, as well as to absolutely prohibit decadent dramas rich in cities, etc. For example, dramas with a boring life as the theme, or erotic dramas centered on women, or comedies that simply cater to low-level tastes, or light musical dramas that always imitate British and American techniques, all need to be oppressed and prohibited. Especially for girls' opera, it should be absolutely banned.</p>
<p>Also, after the emergency measures, the system of performing for two and a half hours is now being debated and argued endlessly, but in advocating shortening the time, it can be said that it is the unanimous request of ten families. In addition, the active control and guidance of the national tour theater troupes centered on the Japan Theater Association is also a noteworthy matter.</p>
<p>Playwrights' Loyalty to the Country</p>
<p>The above is the general trend of Japanese drama on the decisive battle stage, and this is also the undisputed attitude of today's drama. In order to achieve good results in this regard, the commander's government office absolutely needs to establish a powerful unified drama policy, and must implement the playwright's self-consciousness and the active subjective sponsorship promoted.</p>
<p>In recent years, these two aspects have gradually reached the orbit in proportion to the times. Drama is often trapped in a complex and subtle realm due to inheritance. This phenomenon full of mistakes cannot be said to be absolutely absent. Emergency measures are gradually facing a clear ultimate goal and are advancing by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>According to today's situation, there are still various difficulties, and sufficient results have not been harvested. However, the active leadership of the related government offices, the establishment of the Japan Drama Association, etc., have already been broken through the previous obstacles and have become an effective driving force for creating drama on the decisive battle stage. The kind of "do not talk about national affairs" eccentricity that we often saw in playwrights in the past has disappeared, and now all playwrights are under the true national consciousness, preparing to do their best for their professional posts. The reorganization and adjustment of Japanese drama will surely achieve perfect results in the near future (End) (Translated by An from the Mainichi Shimbun on July 6)</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<h3 id="e58">A Summary of Various Undertakings Hosted by This Office: Dedicated to Alleviating Poverty and Sickness <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>This office organizes six social undertakings with the aim of relieving poverty and sickness, and showing compassion for the orphaned and destitute:</p>
<p>Poverty Relief Fund… To aid the hidden poor and those in abject poverty, as well as widowers, widows, and the helpless, sending them to homes for the elderly.</p>
<p>Orphan Assistance Fund… To educate and care for orphaned children, providing them with opportunities to learn skills and become useful members of society.</p>
<p>Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund… To subsidize medical expenses for elementary school teachers or introduce them to designated doctors and hospitals for free treatment.</p>
<p>Medical Assistance Fund… To introduce impoverished patients who are unable to afford medical treatment to free treatment or to provide appropriate financial aid for medical expenses.</p>
<p>Maternity Assistance Fund… To protect impoverished mothers, sending midwives for free assistance during childbirth. In cases of difficult labor, hospitalization will be provided, with all expenses borne by this office.</p>
<p>Small Loan Fund… Interest-free loans are provided to unemployed, capable individuals to start small, honest businesses.</p>
<p>This office accepts donations. A little contribution is welcome. We respectfully request that compassionate individuals generously contribute to benefit others and themselves, for which the merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Benefiting the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Since its commencement on July 1st, the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Xizang Road has been providing free consultations, gold needle treatments, and medications for the epidemic section. Moreover, diagnosis and treatment are available day and night, earning it a great reputation. The poor and sick have benefited immensely. In recent days, due to the extreme heat, the number of outpatients at the hospital has surged, reaching over 500 per day, with the number of inpatients approaching 100, making the workload very intense. Furthermore, women and children often appear confused and panicked when seeking treatment, not understanding the procedures. The hospital has assigned dedicated staff to provide guidance and explanations in the waiting area to comfort patients. However, the hospital lacks a foundation fund, and the expenditure on medications is particularly high, with monthly expenses reaching two million yuan. Therefore, it urgently hopes that compassionate individuals from all walks of life will generously contribute and actively donate to ensure that this charitable work does not cease. Donations can be sent directly to the hospital or collected on its behalf by the social service department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Nantong Sleeping-Through-Teachings-on-Morality Society regularly promotes morality, influencing people's hearts, and is particularly praised by the world for its practical and realistic approach to various charitable undertakings. In addition to establishing a free smoking cessation clinic this year, it has recently organized tea distribution, setting up over a dozen tea urns at key locations on various roads. They have also hired National Physician Mr. Feng Daozeng to provide free medical consultations and medicine at the society every afternoon at 2 PM, greatly benefiting the poor and sick. However, due to the extraordinarily high prices of goods and financial constraints, they deeply hope that major philanthropists in Shanghai will generously contribute to ensure that the society's charitable endeavors can continue, which is truly a blessing for the impoverished people of society.</p>
<p>The Pude Society on Wenzhou Road is providing summer medical consultations and medicine. To facilitate the treatment of poor patients in western Shanghai and avoid overcrowding, a consultation branch has been established with the agreement of Xu Tianyi Chinese Medicine Store at 120 Jiaozhou Road, starting today. Doctors Xu Renlong and Xu Zichang have been hired to provide free medical consultations and medicine upon presentation of a voucher, without charging any fees.</p>
<p>Guanyu Middle School Offers Aid</p>
<p>Guanyu Middle School, located in the New Market at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Maoming Road, has consistently offered free tuition waivers to aid impoverished students. This summer, with the assistance of the third graduating class, they have raised funds through donations. Applicants for free or half-tuition for all grades of new students can immediately obtain application forms from the school and register. There is no limit to the number of students, and both male and female students are accepted.</p>
<p>He Duanrong Piano Recital</p>
<p>Pianist Ms. He Duanrong will hold a He Duanrong student piano recital at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:30 PM on the 31st of this month. The program includes masterpieces such as Beethoven's grand piano pieces, Chopin's nocturnes, and Mendelssohn's brilliant spinning song. Tickets are priced at thirty, fifty, and one hundred yuan. Sales will begin on the 29th at the Lyceum Theatre. Proceeds from ticket sales, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Poor Student Assistance Fund.</p>
<p>Rental Bookstore Seeks Staff Members, Initiated by Yuan Jun and Others: Recognizing the difficulty faced by impoverished students in purchasing books, and to provide assistance, a used book rental service has been launched to allow each impoverished student to borrow textbooks without spending money, thereby reducing their burden. At the same time, students from the middle class can also borrow books. However, due to the small number of staff members, they are unable to manage the operations. Therefore, they are publicly seeking volunteers. Those willing to serve are requested to send a letter as soon as possible to Dong Yuanjun at No. 5, Lane 166, Lingbao Road, Shanghai, indicating their name and contact address for scheduling purposes.</p>
<p>The China Youth Industrial Lecture: is scheduled for this Saturday (3 PM) in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association. Mr. Shen Jichao will lecture on "The Management and Development of China's Paper Industry." All are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Residence Permit: Yao Qianli, a candidate for the scholarship from this newspaper, found a residence permit No. 114052 belonging to Yan Wenxin, a child, on Xinzha Road yesterday after finishing the examination. It has been sent to this office for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Artist Yi Zhihua Founds Art School, Comes to Shanghai to Raise Funds <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Dabao'en Temple, outside Zhonghua Gate in the capital, is the foremost ancient temple in Jiangnan (dating back to the third year of the Chiwu era of the Three Kingdoms). The skull of the Great Tang Sanzang Xuanzang is buried behind the temple, named the Sanzang Pagoda. A hall was rebuilt to commemorate him, named the Sanzang Hall. The temple was most prosperous during the Ming Dynasty, with thousands of monks who promoted Buddhism and spread its teachings throughout the country. The teaching was unparalleled. Throughout the dynasties, eminent monks emerged one after another. This special project involves establishing a Buddhist Art College within the temple, with the support of Chairman Wang, Acting Chairman Chen, President Wen, President Jiang, President Chu, Minister Ren, Minister Chen, Governor Chen, Governor Fu, Governor Gao, Military Commander Xu, Military Commander He, Gu Zhongchen, Wen Lanting, Zhu Hexiang, Xu Chongqin, Lin Kanghou, Liu Haisu, Xi Zicheng, Li Tailai, and other prominent figures in the capital.</p>
<p>The Master is proficient in Buddhism, calligraphy, painting and seal engraving. His figures, landscapes, ancient Buddhas, pine trees, and orchids are all elegant, fresh, and unrestrained. His calligraphy in various styles, including Zhong Ding inscriptions, seal script, regular script, cursive script, Wei stele, Han stele, and stone drum script, possesses an aura of overwhelming power. His accomplishments in calligraphy and painting can be considered profound.</p>
<p>Now, the Buddhist Art College is being established at Dabao'en Temple in Nanjing to promote culture, cultivate character, develop Eastern art, enrich monotonous lives, emphasize poetry and music, cultivate advanced specialized talents, expound national culture, train art education teachers, cultivate noble national character, research工艺美術 to promote social beautification. Both students and monks are accepted, regardless of gender. Tuition and board are planned to be completely free, allowing outstanding high school or junior high school graduates who are unable to pursue further education to have the opportunity to study art for free. In addition to the revenue from Dabao'en Temple's properties, the Mountain Master is raising funds from various provinces, cities, and counties. The purpose of establishing the Buddhist Art College is to express through paintings, calligraphy, and writings the deeds of ancient saints and sages from various religions that are sufficient to rectify people's hearts and promote moral education, in order to disseminate them widely in society, so that everyone can be influenced by religion and find spiritual sustenance.</p>
<p>Now coming to Shanghai to raise funds, and bring dozens of figures, landscapes, plum blossoms, orchids, pine trees and Buddhas paintings, all the master's proud works, living in the south courtyard of Guangfu Temple, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, all lovers of calligraphy and painting: do not miss this opportunity. Buddhist Art College is to cultivate talents for the country for free, hoping that enthusiastic social education patriotic gentlemen help, so that the accumulation of sand into a tower, gathering armpits into a fur coat, so that the school will soon be completed, then the religion is fortunate, the country is fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Blood and Tears (5) Navy <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>Across the desk covered with blue flannel in the dean's office, the fat I Colonel revealed half of his body.</p>
<p>"It's really a good opportunity. Even though it's a starry night, I didn't leave the school because I had something to investigate..."</p>
<p>"You must be very busy!"</p>
<p>Longfu asked politely.</p>
<p>"No, I always have half an hour. I would like to show the painter who paints warships a submarine."</p>
<p>Although the voice was quite rough, it contained a smile. Ensign Nitta had gone to the city on business, so only Longfu and Jiren were sitting there.</p>
<p>"I have already seen the training ship. Everything is surprising."</p>
<p>Longfu expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>"I have served on submarines for a long time... Captain Changjian, his hair is completely white. But this is not because of the hardship of living in the submarine. Enduring that kind of hardship is what a soldier should do. Maybe it's more appropriate to say it's a soldier's responsibility. There is no greater responsibility than that of a submarine captain."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"Of course, it's not that the captain is the only one who works hard. If all the personnel are not nervous, a little carelessness by the helmsman and the water drainage hand can lead to a catastrophic disaster. So the breathing of all personnel must be consistent from top to bottom. At the same time, there is no warship in the world that has such a family feeling as a submarine. Perhaps this is because the lives of all the personnel are supported by the submarine, and everyone, from the captain and officers to the soldiers, eats the same good and bad food. This is not the case in other types of ships. In addition, the captain and officers are very concerned about the soldiers. The soldiers also trust the officers... I have also acted as a matchmaker for a soldier and helped them get married..."</p>
<p>On I Colonel's face, tanned by the sun, shone infinite smiles.</p>
<p>Longfu thought that the reason why such consistent feelings arose might be due to the past that had never been experienced. For example, a group of people fled behind the shady mountain, and practiced hardships and struggles unknown to people for a long time, so they produced unity and sincerity. Isn't this the same as the submarine crew? To be honest, today, when the Pacific turmoil is in full swing, everyone is gradually focusing their attention on magazines and newspapers. Who would talk about submarines? Perhaps submarines will only attract the attention of the world when they encounter difficulties. Jiangfu thought repeatedly in his heart.</p>
<p>"The death of Sergeant Chengqian last August is a concrete manifestation. It is natural to sacrifice oneself to save the flooded water, which is naturally due to the desire to protect the supreme imperial warship's heart, but I think another aspect is the expression of the greatest friendship for the trusted officers and beloved subordinates."</p>
<p>In I Colonel's tone, there was already a meaning of sorrow. (124)</p>
