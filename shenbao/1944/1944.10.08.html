<h3>解決米糧問題的途徑究竟何在</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>昨天大陸新報社評以[食米問題的本質]爲題，對於諮詢委員會關於食米問題的建議，對於中國方面輿論的主張，加以批評。我站在諮詢委員會一份子，輿論界一份子的地位，不能默爾無詞，願以最誠摯的態度，陳述所感如次：　　大陸新報社評的要旨，歸納如下數點：　　○食糧運入限制的強化，是刺激米價上漲的材料之一。所以諮詢委員會的建議，是反映人民的要求，也是代表人民的利害。但人民祗注意到目前自己的生活，所要求的往往非現實的，有時更能妨礙統一施策，但是所有主張以輿論支持爲背景，向當局攻擊，決不是建設的態度，也不是協力當局所應有的事。　　○目前最實際的，如何使內地的收買順利進行，在三個月內決定成效。收買工作成功的一天，就是上海民食得到解決的一天。　　○假如認爲米糧自由運入，阻礙內地收買工作的話，則目前應忍受微小犧牲。　　○限制自由移運，使目前緊急的收買工作得以成功，否則就屈服於民衆性急的要求之下，以使工作失敗而終，二者應擇其一。　　○諮詢會是政府與市民之間的橋樑，如以輿論支持爲理由，強制當局實行不可能的建議，則非但不是橋樑，且更成爲當局與人民之間的離間者。　　現在，我就根據上面的幾點，加以論列：　　強化食米運入限制，足以刺激米價上漲，該報社評旣已認爲事實，旣已認爲人民的要求。那末，爲什麼偏要強化限制呢？偏要刺激上漲呢？偏要違反人民要求呢？如果說人民要求，只顧目前生活，往往爲非現實的，更能妨礙統一籬策。那末，怎樣是顧到未來生活？怎樣是現實？怎樣是不妨礙統一施策？米統會成立一年餘了，收買工作已非一次。難道坐持米價自數千元跳至一萬數千元，尚繼續不已，是顧到未來生活嗎？是現實的嗎？是統一施策嗎？歷史的事實是最有力的辯證。　　我們也知道米統會強化限制，其目的，在三個月以內，順利完成收買工作。其理想，使內地的米不能到上海以後，內地米價卽會便宜，於是收買嘖利，公米民米都可解決了。但是，我們的目的正是相同，而我們的理想並不如此，根據過去的經騐，我們顧慮的，在三個月內，有無把握做到○配給米的足額。○配給期的準確。○穩定上海米價。○穩定內地米價。如果有了這幾種把握，那末，莫說限制八公斤以內，就是絕對禁止移運，人民也不會異議的。我們認爲沒有上述的把握，那末，上海米價不能穩定，則上海市民立受痛苦，而內地米價也不能穩定，則便宜收買的理想即不能實現。結果就是限制強化的目的完全失敗。我們再回溯過去兩次強化限制，上海米價立時波動，內地米價隨之波動的事實，更加覺得強化限制移運，是理想與目的不能溝通的辦法，不是統一施策中應採取的步驟。所以，我們終覺強化限制移運的辦法，是一種冒險的舉措，有弊已先至而利則未必的情勢。　　至於輿論界的主張，有中華日報，新中國報，新申報，以及本報的社評，對於強化限制移運的辦法，一致認爲不妥。但是，植田先生以米統會副主任委員的地位，認爲是[只見樹木不見高山]，而大陸新報社評復認爲支持諮詢會的背景，向當局攻擊，不是建設的態度，不是協力當局所應有的事。這種立論不免不顧事實。還是米統會少數人憑藉主觀決定的辦法合理呢？還是多數輿論界代表人民客觀決定的主張合理呢？我想事實就可證明，不容斤斤多辯的　　我們的中心意思，使政府瞭解人民的痛苦，要求當局解除人民不必要的痛苦，使人民也瞭解政府的好意，瞭解盟邦當局的好意。我自己認爲我們一般人卻是保進中日合作的最忠實者。因爲我們重視現實，說老實話，更不肯不加可否的一味唯唯否否，不使人民怨限政府，更不使人民誤會盟邦意思。凡是對於政府施策，對於盟邦施策，唯唯否否，不說實話，這才是當局與人民之間的離間者。　　據我個人的看法，諮詢會，米統會以至輿論界，對於食米問題解決的目的，完全相同，不過解決途徑上的意見，則有不同，這是公衆的事，并非私人的事，只應有公理與利害，而不應感情與意氣。輿論界的態度，尤應愼重，不能輕率以離間等等詞類加之於人。　　最後，本報特將來統會副主任委員植田先生的意見，以及大陸新報社評意見，雖與我們主張不同，但是很願分別譯載，以供中譯載，俾使一般盟邦人士參考，這樣對於食米問題的解決途徑，更能接近一致的方針吧！</p>
<h3>食米問題的本質</h3>
<p>最近上海市政諮詢委員會對於米統會禁止入公斤以上的食米自由運入上海的措置，會經向市經府建議恢復十石以內的自由搬運制度。上海的中國輿論對於此種建議案都非常支持，各報言論都表示對諮詢委員會聲援。此種主張認爲，上海的配給米因爲不能滿足一般市民的需要，所以不得不容認黑市米的存在，同時若強化限制自由搬運，結果必引起上海米價的暴漲，反而對內地收買米榖有不利的影響。　　食米運入限制的強化，是成爲刺戰上海米價暴漲的材料之一，這是事實。同時現在的配給米是不足人民的需要，也極明顯。從這一點看來，諮詢委員會的建議，可說是反映人民的要求，也可說是代表人民的利害。但是，諮詢委員會的任務，並不是單以人民的要求與主張毫不變更的要求當局採納就算完事。蓋一般民衆時常祗注意到目前自己的生活，其所要求的，往往爲非現實的，同時有時更能妨碍統一施策。關於[充分增加配給米]，[不然則緩和移動的限制]等主張，的確是現在上海市民生活上的直接要求，但是，此種主張以輿論的支持爲背景，而向當局攻擊，決不是建設的態度，同時也不是協力當局所應有的事。　　目前的一瞬間，關於食米問題最緊急，且最實際的事，乃是如何使內地的收買得以順利進行；並且這個收買問題，須要在三個月內決定成敗，所以問題非常急迫。一切的努力，必須傾注精力來使工作推進，而收買工作圓滑進行成功的一天，也就是上海民食問題得到解決的一天。假如我們認爲米糧的自由運入，是阻礙內地收買工作的話，則目前雖忍受微小犧牲，則惟有協力當局的施策，纔是眞正的建設方法，實際的態度，因爲現實上不能沒有稍含矛盾與缺點的施策存在。關於食米問題，或者使目前緊迫的收買工作得以成功，否則就屈服於民衆性急的要求之下，以使工作失敗而終。二者應擇其一。　　諮詢委員必須是架於政府與上海市民之間的良好橋樑。假如忽視現實，不顧慮環境，單以輿論的支持爲理由，而強制當局實行不可能的建議，則非但不能成爲良好的橋樑，並且更成爲當局與人民之間的離間者。我們對於一切的建議和提案，無論在表面上如何合理，但不能不加思考，並且偉全般施策的關聯上加以考慮處置，使其能改成現實上可能的建議案。如徒賴輿論支持之名，而使當局陷於窮境的主張，不是我們所應採取的。（譯自十月七日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>日首相披瀝決意勉閣僚推進施策羣策羣力以求戰爭之完遂</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　太平洋戰局今已踏入行將決定日本隆替之重大階段，故實有待於強力戰施策之展開。關於此點，日小磯首相於六日召開之閣議中，會促全體閣僚注意，以期貫澈迫在目前之決戰，並披瀝鞏固之決意如次：時局刻刻緊迫，至於今日，吾人際茲決戰階段，自然不應在機構上着重，但爲完成戰爭，若有障礙，則即在機構及人事上，亦當積極果敢打開難關，突破難關，使強力之籬策得以推進。本人今後所希望者，原爲閣僚互相間須開誠交換意見，過去在閣僚間，雖獲諒解，然事務方面，仍難免有不能澈底推進之遺憾，關於此點，本人尚希各閣僚一心一德，羣策羣力，以求戰爭之完遂，皇國之興隆，有以賴焉。</p>
<h3>最高方針機關不日即將設置</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日最高戰爭指導會議，不僅決定指導戰爭之最高方針，且決定完遂戰爭所不可缺之政治，外交等所有施策之最高方針，此觀前次臨時會議中小磯首相所發表者即已明瞭，惟如何具體實行已決定之最高方針，則當時僅止於擬在內閣設置適當機關，茲悉六日日內閣閣議中，小磯首相會特別強調下列三點謂：○就戰略現狀上言，雖宜於採取不改變機構之方針，但爲遂行戰爭，則必要的機構之改革，自當斷行。○關於政策之運營，擬作強力果敢之執行。○過去在閣僚之間，雖已完全諒解之事，但在事務當局或行政之最下部組織，尚恐有未能澈底執行者云云。由於以上小磯首相之說明，今後關於軍需生產方面陸海軍行政機構，自能益趨簡素有力，而關於生產動員之整備，軍需食糧生產增強方策之澈底遂行，與民衆接觸最密之最下部行政之簡素化，行政事務之刷新等，均斷然付諸實行，觀此次小磯首相之言，可知日本具體實行最高戰爭指導會議所決定的最高方針之機關，不日即將設置。</p>

<h3>杭甬公路沿綫視察記</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員劉漢儒</p>
<p>○富庶的浙東　　自閘口渡江，經蕭山紹興至寧波，沿公路綫三百餘華里間，遍地是將熟之稻，一望無際，連亙不斷，足見浙東爲產米富庶之區。據農人言，浙東之稻，收穫較他處略晚，總須在陰歷八月下旬左右收割，與皖南皖北之晚稻割時相仿。　　棉花是餘姚之特產，產量極富富，據謂本年能輸出之花衣，價值在十萬萬元以上，因故餘姚之富庶亦爲浙東各縣之冠，與紹興之酒，箔同爲繁榮浙東經濟之根源。　　車輛駛入紹興縣境，即見兩傍居民之屋，均爲瓦房，屋以石爲基，礎極高，臨水建造，楊樹數株，傍屋生長，臨風搖曳，間有風帆數艘，順風而航，船夫啣長烟桿，掌舵行駛，悠然自得。村童三五，或臥牛背，或嬉戲溪畔，農婦農夫俯首耕作，聞汽車聲咸起立而觀，耕牛被驚倉皇四散，頑童拍掌，爲狀大樂，此情此景，身處其間誠令人頓忘慶世。　　紹興以製酒著名，紹酒名聞世界。錫箔·大綢·華紗·香糕·腐乳等，都爲紹興的名產，所以紹興不但在農業上有很好的產量，就是商業，亦極鼎盛，較寧波商埠，有相等之勢。　　山芋·棉花，在蕭山產量亦很多，浙東實在是一個相當富庶的區域。　　○民生困苦　　浙東旣稱爲富庶之區，照理民生狀況，應該比較寬裕，但因因民衆爲被剝奪過多，遂至民不聊生，困苦異常。　　據詢悉：浙東田賦，政府每畝收榖三十五斤，但和平區以外的舊政權亦須征收每畝三十五斤二十五斤，以這些是正稅。還有地方部隊，同經征人員的層　豪奪巧取，又要支附加稅，橫征暴歛的結果，農民實收不過生產量之一小半，這一小半裹面所有全家食糧，耕種成本都在這裹面支付，所以一與農民談到他們的經濟狀況，都是搖首慼額，大嘆苦經。　　農民的糧食收入，除了應繳各方官稅之外，所餘一部份，還不能完全自由支配，對於官米收買，軍米收買，亦要任憑給價賣出，等到賣完了，再拿大價錢去買米回來吃，其他一切日用品如肥皂·洋火·布匹等等，莫不要出大價錢去買，自己田裹種出來的不值錢，要吃要穿要用的，反要再出大價錢去買，這種事情，農民們每一談起都免不了有點[怨憤之情，溢於言表]！　　其實我們亦知道，這種情事，不獨浙東如此，其他各地，亦有相彷的情形，或者浙東比較更甚一點罷了。　　杭用綫沿綫各處的米價，大都在四五千元一担的上下，人民的食品，以山芋，米，參半食之。山芋每斤五元左右，比京滬一帶便宜不了多少　　浙東地區的治安，在經過清鄉以後，點和綫的治安，似乎沒有什麼問題，除了城市大邨鎭以外，大部份地方有游擊隊，土匪以及[三五支隊]的蹤跡，眞正的鄉民中，殷實的都避居在城市，景況不大好的，則處在多種統治階層裹，宛轉的生活着。　　○公務員的生活　　此行會見過幾位軍政地方的長官，如行將離任的傳省長，紹興行政專員卜愈民，寗波行政專員陶孝潔氏，鄞縣縣長秦亞修氏，以及駐防浙東的第十師師長謝文達氏。同諸位政軍長官會談的結果，我們知道一點關於一般公務員的生活情況。大體上說起來，浙東的公務員生活尚能過得去，最大的原因，是他們有個有及家屬的配給米，每一個人和家屬都有三斗以上的公配米，按人口數配給，米的存量，在本年底以前是沒有問題的。木柴，寗波只賣一元五角錢一斤，米有辦法，柴便宜，其他的問題，就容易解決了，所以一般下層公務員的生活，是比京滬一帶好得多。　　中上級的公務員，就是政務官以下的重要事務官，像科長以上的人們，我們看起來，他們大半都很像[活得落]的樣子。其餘有[個別單位]勢力的，生活都很豐富。在寗波後市的[花]窟裹面，尋歡作樂的，除了暴利主義者商人之外，就是這一大批中上級的軍政公務人員和有勢力者，推盃換盞，呼盧喝雉，浙東一般民衆困苦的原因，我們襲得這一批人，應該知道。得很清楚，並且要負上一大半責任。　　○良心政治　　寗波行政專員陶孝潔氏會對記者們談：[我常誥試我的部隊，固然我們的薪俸收入，不足以生活，但是找錢的標準，應該是不超過普通生活所必需者，如果過了奢侈的生活，還要緊歛錢財，那就是太沒有良心了]。（大意如此）。同時在寗波的第十師師長謝文達氏亦對記者們這樣說：[上頭所發的軍餉，不夠全師士兵數天的軍糧，不足的數額，都由我個人設法維持，我維持士兵的生活方法，是使他們[布衣暖蔬飯飽]籌餉糣以不擾民，不妨害國稅爲原則，我的士兵決不向民衆索取分文。我以[生意生產]的方法來籌款養士兵，同時以六個字訓誡官兵，就是[憑良心，負責任]那句話。]陶謝兩氏是浙東地方最高級的軍政長官，我們相信他們的人格，深信他們能實行他們的良心政治主張。（全文完）</p>

<h3>西南太平洋上日本空軍的英姿</h3>
<p>在西南太平洋日本陸軍航空隊基地上·每日都很緊張，不讓良機溜走，時時準備抓住它，好將敵人殲滅。在戰雲密佈之下，西南太平洋的日本陸軍航空隊，早已整備總攻的態勢，一待時機到臨，便要大發神威。茲將西南太平洋日本陸鷲的近況，作一個簡短的報告，以明他們如何在新攻勢中嚴搏飛舞的樣子。</p>
<h3>新司偵隊</h3>
<p>要　擊滅敵機，先須充分知道敵情。西南太平洋的敵方航空勢力，在惡劣天氣的包庇下，於險峻無路的崇山峻嶺中蠢動，所以日本的偵察機隊，必須衝着積亂雲，翱翔於魔怪似的斯丹萊山脈上空，仔細搜索，其辛勤勞苦，實在無言可喻。　　這支身經百戰的部隊，在第一次澳洲攻擊時，會光榮地獲得獎狀，他們的銳眼決不讓敵機溜走。與歐洲第二戰綫建立同時，在澳洲及新幾內亞周圍忽然不見敵方四引擎的大型機。這種情形的被發覺，便是新司偵隊的偉動。及至企圖展開太平洋反攻時，在阿特密拉爾羣島的洛倫伽島上有B24三百架，荷蘭第亞有P38及其他二百數十架，瓦克得約有百架，澳洲有小型機百五六十架，合計集結約八百架的飛機；迨新幾內亞作戰進展，B24更前進到必阿克島，但因日本轟炸機隊的猛襲，寶貝似的大型機喪失很多，所以嚇壞了膽，雖然在作戰上感到幾多不便，也不得不將這些大型機遷來遷去。這些都是日本偵察機所探知的。　　某日，佐佐木大尉飛越斯丹萊山脈，偵察新幾內亞敵軍某某基地歸來時，祇見白雲浮游羣山頂上。當那座常常不見山頂的某某山隱約現於左方時，突被積亂雲所包。坐機受到惡氣流的衝擊，錐揉而下，二百米，三百米；頭上的蓋板也已裂飛，佐佐木大尉知道事情憶糟，乃作最後的掙扎，以求突破險境。在被積雲阻住視綫的山脈中，他大膽地作急降下，這時視界忽開，方知飛機正在冊中溪谷上面飛行。佐佐木大尉於是沿着溪谷，穿過雲層，向下一望，不料就是敵方基地。當即從容偵察，完畢後再從原路而返，這時溪谷空際的積亂雲已經消散，佐佐木大尉就趁便作綿密的氣象偵察，這樣便完全解決了它的秘密，終於征服了會經吞噬了不少同志的魔怪似的斯丹萊山脈。　　現在，新司偵隊對於西南太平洋的地形氣象，巳瞭如指掌，爲了準備展開攻勢而繼續活躍。</p>
<h3>軍偵隊</h3>
<p>軍　揁隊活躍的舞台，本來是大陸作戰的主要戰塲，這次的進出海洋，確是別開生面。他們因爲富於實戰的經騐，頗能推陳出新，所以雖然活躍海上的時日還不久，但在担任掩護船團，指揮連絡，轟炸，邀擊等任務時，無不勝任愉快，除擊沈擊毀敵軍潛艇十一隻，擊墜敵機三架以外，並因掩護船團有功而得獎詞七次，在太平洋出陣未久便樹立了如此顯赫的武勳。　　海上軍偵隊的島田大尉，在八月某日任務終了正擬降下於某某基地時，突然碰到敵方P38的編隊來襲基地。島田大尉立刻打消着陸之念，決心單機邀擊，扳轉機首，猛然衝入敵機隊中，敵機慌忙開槍射擊。被稱爲型機權威的島田大尉，操縱術正是神乎其技。敵機羣被他這裹一衝那裹一撞，衝得七零八落，他們的槍彈也浪費罄盡，沒法祇好徒呼負負地歸去。島田大尉也因槍彈用盡，正想歸基地。不幸這時候又來了一批生力的敵方戰鬥機羣，結果單機邀擊三十餘架敵機的島田大尉，終於在南方天空壯烈陣亡。現在，海上軍偵隊的勇士正在摩拳擦掌，立志要替隊長復仇哩。</p>
<h3>轟炸機隊</h3>
<p>對　於妄想總反攻的敵人，日本轟炸機隊力避無謂的耗損，對敵人的要點，抓住每個機會，用巧妙的戰法，破壞其各個勢力。一接到敵軍集結的報告，當即於夜晚派出少數轟炸機，飛去投擲準確的巨彈　　例如前幾天的攻擊瓦克得，必阿克，日方的幾架轟炸機便一舉葬送十餘倍的敵機，而日方卻沒有犧牲一架。麥克沃塞會作　語道，由於獲得瑪塘·荷蘭第·必阿克等基地，新幾內亞周圍的作戰巳完全終了，但日軍轟炸機隊所用的七妙戰術，使敵軍要將飛機集結於適當的基地必須煞費周折，而且縱然一時集結完畢，其半數亦非不絕飛行巡邏不可。他們因爲受不住日機的猛襲，甚至演出散發[彼此停止夜間轟炸]的傳單等　態。</p>
<h3>戰鬥機隊</h3>
<p>戰　事爆發以來，空中英雄迭出，過去則有隼南鄉，最近則有高田戰鬥隊長，在這種不朽的光榮傳統下，活躍於西南太平洋上的日本戰鬥機隊隊員，正繼着先烈的鬥志，勇猛作戰。種種悲壯的故事，正是不勝枚舉，這裹單拿最近的一回事來說說吧。　　這事發生在新幾內亞頂端的日軍基地上。那一天，同往常一樣，敵機準時飛來騷擾，機種是P38和B25，共計六十架。B25的編隊，從掩蔽着基地的紅樹（Mangrove）林蔭，在五米至米米的超低空，飛來偷襲。這時，日方飛機業巳打下半數以上的敵機。中村曹長所碰到的敵機，無心戀虎匆匆逃走，中村曹長要想追上去，已經來不及，心裹正沒好氣，湊巧看到一架剛向地上開槍掃射回來的B25，馬上俯上機首，猛然衝去，吃了一驚的敵機，慌忙抬起機首，打算向上急昇，不料它的尾翼就在這當兒浸入海中，它便如此被海波拖了下去。中村曹長看到敵機這種樣子，又好笑又好氣；笑的是它想逃命反而喪了生，氣的是不能爽爽快快殺搏一陣。說時遲那時快，中村曹長早已掉轉機首，從後上方急迫另外一架。那架敵機還不知道巳有黃雀在後，向一架日機急劇下降，在正欲開槍射擊時才發覺背後中村曹長的飛機，一時之間想逃也來不及，便以急降下的姿勢鑽入海中，而中村曹長也因追得太急，收勒不住，便尾追着敵機，一同消失於海中。在這千鈞一發的當兒，中村曹長將操縱桿向扳滿。這時候，望着中村曹長追擊敵機的地上部隊，都向海灘跑來，他們以爲中村曹長是知敵人同歸於盡了。誰知海上飛沫四濺，中村曹長的飛機已從海中一躍而起，飛到百米光景的空際，水淋淋地悠然飛到飛機塲上，在滑走路上降陸。看到的人沒有一個不目瞪口張，呆了半晌。　　一彈不發地擊墜二架敵機，並且還能水中生還的奇蹟。所以當中村曹長的飛機安然着陸時，基地上歡聲雷動，一齊讚揚其旺盛的鬥志及神捘（福岡特派員）。（吉譯自八月三十日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>[這時候終於已經來到了，老友，這終於來臨了——你我必須說再會的時候。上帝知道；我是寗願賣了我自己來替代你，但是我是不值分文的，然而你——你知道嗎，我心愛的？下面街上一個商人，一個有着我所有的一切（除了你）的人，他會給我五百塊錢，祗要我把你給他，他便把五百塊錢一個衣不蔽體，屋不遮天，連一片麵包也沒有的窮光蛋！我爲何還要猶豫呢？你祗是幾塊木片及幾根不值什麼的弦綫，也不值使人爲你而飢餓的，我祗要帶着你走下樓——再走幾步——把你放在櫃台上，什麼事都算了，我就有五百塊錢了！我就可離開這破爛的斗室，我便有食物可吃，這些我已一年未上口了！我又能混身在一羣熱識的闊人中，我也成了他們的一份子了。五百塊！啊，這是一筆錢財，一筆可觀的大財呢！一切都爲了你，你這無腸胃的東西，在你是不知飢餓的，你，你這無靈魂的軀殼。不，等一下！我確定嗎？]　　那人便在梵華鈴的弦上用手指撥了一下，並且低下了頭去聽，柔和的音波像甜蜜的，糢糊的往事。　　[你的Ｅ調太低了些，]那人說，[好，這不要緊的。]　　被一種猝然的決定所主宰着的他，怱忙地站起來，打開了琴匣，把梵華鈴摔進去，他又遲疑着微弱的音響隱約可聞，這似乎是痛苦的呻吟，那人又提起梵華鈴，托在臂上，面頰貼在琴上。　　[怎麼，老友，損傷了你嗎？啊！我錯待你了，你是有心靈的，我甚至相信你能回憶的呢？]　　[讓我想，多久了？二十，三十，三十五年了，人生的大半韶光我們都相處在一起，而且在這以前，我已先認識你了，你是在一家舊貨舖內，那保管你的人與你相處得更久呢，有誰來的時候，他肯把你給人家看，讓他們看你的表記[克里莫那，一七三一]，但他不願賣掉你，這大概是他還未嚐到飢餓的緣故吧，那時我便已愛着你了，愛你這木製的無生命的東西，我愛握你聽你唱，我渴念能得到你——我在以前是從不渴念什麼的——　　[一天，老人就將你給我了。　　[[把你的舊提琴給我，]他說，[你就拿我的克里莫那去吧！]　　[[拿牠去？]我驚呌了。　　[[是的，]老人說，[拿去吧！因爲我確信你會好好地保存牠的，我老了，別人就會佔有牠的，克里莫那一定會淪在陌生人手中了，我不願這麼做，我寗願送給你。]　　[所以我就帶你回家，坐了半夜，輕輕地把弓在你的弦上拉着，我眞是世界上最快樂的人了，我想，我把你放在晚上一醒便可摸着的地方，就是一個王國，我也不肯與你調換呀！但是，那時我是不餓的呀！]　　那人仍握着琴，貼在頰上，溫存地撥着弦，好像在夜中自語，似乎自己也不知在說些什麼。　　[三十五年了，我們同觀着世塵，我們同嚐着甘苦，帝王，乞丐，都聽着你，愛着你。]　　[你再記得那在柏林的一夜嗎？當我們奏著[夢]的時候，右邊包廂內那位美麗的婦人拋下一朶大玫瑰，牠鬼在弦上—一根刺构在弦上，當我想把牠拿下時，血紅的花瓣都飄落在我的腳上，於是我便奏[夏天最後的玫瑰]，我確信你那夜是有心靈的，我覺得你的心是在跟着你的弦振動而抖着，曲終的時候，人們眼中盈滿了淚水，而她，音樂已主宰了她，我想。她站起來，大呌着：[不，不！這不是最後一朶，世界上正開滿着玫瑰，看吧！]她又拋下了一大束紅的，白的花。　　[我驚奇她是深愛着我或是你呢？當玫瑰（世界上所有的玫瑰）盛開的時候，她卻黯然殞逝了，你一定還能記得這些的，老友！當天黑了，其他的人留下了她的玉體走了，我們去向她道別，那時世界上正盛開着玫瑰，我便把牠們綴在她的墓上，於是你便唱起來了。呀！你唱得多感人！我常相信你的靈魂帶着玫瑰的芬芳在你的歌聲中散播開去了。在其後一次，我們演奏時，有人拋下了一朶玫瑰，我用腳把牠踩了，當她已消逝了時，玫瑰再有何權利可開花呢？　　[從那時起，咱們的生活壞了，世界上也沒有什麼可爲之奮鬥的了，而你是變得更寶貴了，因爲你是唯一瞭解我的，我還說你是沒有靈魂的，寬恕我吧，老人！人在飢餓時的說話，是不能受譴責的吧？]　　[啊，我是多麼愚蠢的東西！別再對一隻舊提琴喋喋不休了，我必須裝飽我的空腹的！]　　那人毅然站起，把梵華鈴粗暴地　在匣內，用力關了蓋，提起了牠，又遲疑着，聽着弦綫因粗暴的擲摔而顫動着，他聽見一絲嘆息，微弱得像已死了的愛人唇中吐出的永訣的喘息，那人苦惱地跨了一步，又跨了一步，又停止了猝然抓起提琴，捧在手中。　　[不，不，我不能，我不能！，我不願！我也許是　了；一定　了，一定瘋了，無論如何我不願這樣做，我已經不餓了——]　　那人打開了匣，再提起琴來，像孩子般地抱在懷中。　　[我夢想賣了你呢，我的寶貝！但是，一個魔鬼引誘着我！飢餓的魔鬼，現在牠滾開了，我是很快樂了，很滿足了，來，給我唱一曲吧，我眞快樂。]　　那人舉起梵華鈴，拉着弓。　　[啊，這Ｅ弦是好些了，現在我們都好了，我們是快樂的，不是嗎？給我唱她的玫瑰吧，看呀！她在那邊包廂裹呢，是在花叢中呢，她正在微笑，正在向我們拋花束，紅的。她在聽的時候，我們一定盡我們的力，一切所有力的力。]　　烱烱的眼閃着光輝，蒼白的雙頰泛着緋紅，飢餓及惱怒已置之九宵，巳是遺忘了的東西了。他又是音樂的主宰了，那間閣樓的斗室已漸漸擴大……擴大成輝煌的大演奏廳，那裹坐着千萬個貴客，他們都在神聖的，諧和的音響下凝屏了氣息，他自己的靈魂在琴弦上呼吸，人們都被感動着，因哭泣而抖着，因狂笑而在搖擺，他們在大聲呼喊着。　　[聽呀！聽呀！我的伴侶呀！]那人喊着：[好呀！再來一次吧！呀！今夜我們已征服這世界了，光照耀得多亮呀！這是狂喜—這是天堂！]　　音樂響了更響，樂弓愈拉愈快。　　拍！一根弦斷了，拍—又是一根！　　超然的音節。沉爲悲哀的低訴，握着弓的手，變得不穩定了；粗野的目光停止了狂熱的閃瞬，凝注在右面的一點，緊張了的表情鬆懈成了微笑，聲音是低而纖細的！　　[再來一朶玫瑰，我的美人！我的絕世艷后！光綫黯淡了，我的視綫矇朧了，我祗能看見你，祗有你！]　　後！最後的一根弦也斷了。（齊洛譯）</p>
<h3>推荐[教師萬歲]—介紹給關心教育者</h3>
<p>— 林丘</p>
<p>○……新近有一件極其愉快的事，就是看了一　好戲和一張好片子——[金小玉]和[教師萬歲]。[金小玉]（苦幹演出）在近頃的話劇壇上，論編，論導，論演，都可以說是[功力悉敵]之作；而[教師萬歲]則是近年來難得一見的好電影。　　○……如片名所示，這片子以教師生活爲題材，如實地揭露了上海小學教育腐爛的一角，教師生活的清苦，同時也描寫了在萬分艱困中爲這神聖事業而努力的一羣。戰爭是一種無情的破壞，一方面要盡力作有效的犧牲，一方面要盡量作可能的舖充，而教育問題正是培養元氣的一大課題。申報歷屆主辦的助學運動，各方贊助的熱烈，捐輸的踴躍，正說明了社會人士對於這一現實的重視。但作爲文化活動之一環的電影，能夠這樣密接現實，而又用圓熟的藝術，非常具象，非常動人地把它表現出來，提供於觀衆的[教師萬歲]，不能不說是創舉。　　○……[教師萬歲]的編導者桑弧先生，以前我們會看過他所編的[肉][洞房花燭夜][人約黃昏後][儂本疾情]諸片，雖然他在每一部作品中都有所聲訴，更眩目的卻是那動人的故事。循着預定的鵠的，能夠如此明快，如此寫事地傳達作者的思想的，[老師萬歲]是僅有的一例。但我們的作者是蘊藉的，所以他寫的雖是這麼重大的問題，卻用了那樣輕鬆的筆觸。輕鬆，然而親切，使人沒有生澀和滯重的感覺。對於人物的刻劃，特別可以看出作者的創作傾向，這些人物多少帶着作者的理想的色彩，然而莫不是活生生有血有肉的形象。他們都十分平凡，有他們的向上性，卻也有他們的缺點，他們是肉眼凡胎的人，而不是神，即或如宛轉於泥淖之中，卻有着那樣高貴的感情的舞女張娜娜，也祗是一個不可必其無的[性靈中人]。　　○……可驚異的是作者的導演技七，據說[教師萬歲]是桑弧先生導演的處女作，從這裹更可以看出作者修養的深度。全片進行的和諧，有如行雲流水，自然輕快，所處處閃燦着作者的才華。即便極細微的地方也不肯放鬆。其手法的獨到處，有一點可以特別提出的，例如全片塲與塲[化出]，這樣大膽的嚐試，且能做到那麼圓到自如的，就我淺陋的經騐，中國影片中似乎還未之前見。　　○……筆者願意以極大的欣喜，把[教師萬歲[推薦給愛好電影藝術的觀衆，並介紹於關心教育問題的人士之前。</p>
<h3>中西音樂義奏聆後誌感</h3>
<p>— 淑均</p>
<p>盛況空前的中西音樂演奏大會，已於昨天結束了！關於這次的演奏，固然關係着許多莘莘學子升學的命運，同時，也能在這充滿靡靡之音的都市裹，提起人們一點對正當娛樂的啓示。尤其是國樂，它是幾千年來遺留遞傳的國粹，可是近年來它竟像一朶空谷幽蘭似的不爲人所重視而漸趨憔悴了！這次，在國樂研究會等有心人的努力灌嬌艷的色彩，又婷婷地盛開着了！　　當我坐在蘭心靜聽演奏之時，我的心魂跟着悠揚婉轉的音樂，也在飄飄然了！雖然，我不是當筵顧曲的周郎，但是我想拿[此曲祗應天上有，人間那得幾回聞]的詩句來讚美他，凡是聽過演奏的人，誰都不能說是過譽吧？尤其是孫裕德先生的琵琶眞是彈得神乎其技，白居易琵琶行上說的[大珠小珠落玉盤]，形容得眞一點也不誇張。琵琶清越的聲音，深和着我的心絃，我是整個地陶醉了！還有張子謙先生的古琴，曲雅出俗，據說是和孫先生的琵琶一樣，會下過二十餘年的苦功，無怪其名震中外，絕非偶然倖致的了！在各種樂器大合奏的時候聲音之調和，悠揚婉轉絕無嘈雜，參差，不協調之弊。也許有人說，國樂太單調些，不及西樂的繁複，我卻以爲音樂的美妙是在乎能感動人，能激起聽衆內心的共鳴，若專以音符的繁簡來論定整個藝術，也未免太[以　測海]了。　　總之，我覺得國樂旣有蒼涼慷慨的悲壯，復有清揚婉轉的溫柔，眞是管絃之中，變化萬千呢！它是陶治性情的無上聖品，又是東方古國的寶藏，希望受好音樂的國人，努力去發掘它，提倡它，並且發揚光大它吧！</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽甲組十路雄師介紹</h3>
<p>本報主辦之申報盃籃球聯賽，開始籌備以來，歷一月餘。承各方熱烈贊助，已全部就緒。且於前晚（六日）在日陸軍宿舍健身房，展開序幕，情緒熱烈。蓋得塲塲地之宜，預料嗣後必更有盛況。按此次甲組十隊，全係邀請方式，乙組則先取報名，然後酌予選錄，結果報名者七十六隊，當局因格於塲地支配問題，不得巳僅錄三十六隊，分十六部比賽。對未予錄取各隊，委員會當局深表歉意。值此方展幕之期，爰簡作介紹甲組十強實力及戰術，以爲球迷索驥。</p>
<h3>華聯藥廠人材濟濟</h3>
<p>該隊爲華聯藥廠同人所組織。上屆西青聯賽，一舉稱雄，威震球壇，球員均沙塲老將，瞿錫麟孔廣益等，球迷早已熟稔。其勝人一等處，即能窺敵之弱點而施以進攻，方今籃球比賽，已進展至運用戰術，始克取勝。該隊之戰術多端，可稱獨步滬上，應歸功於指導張溎祥之腦筋。</p>
<h3>中北軍隊北派之雄</h3>
<p>中北在滬上極爲球迷所歡迎，此次除原班人馬，如李震中沈聿恭李寶中等外，復邀名後衛卓國榮助陣。卓之作風，以殺辣夠勁稱，則與中北之球路相同，自可益見精彩。預料此一支北派軍，在申報盃中定有極滿意之傑作</p>
<h3>大華老招兵買馬</h3>
<p>大華在楊叔鼎籌劃之下，此番招兵賣馬，足籃雙棲人材張邦綸，及前華聯名將張錦璇聞風來歸，而老將如陸鐘恩許文奎馮念華陣祥龍輩，東山再起，陣容整齊。其前程必呈燦爛，而往昔百樂門之雄風，不難於本屆大華隊中領略得到。</p>
<h3>華南劉氏後起之秀</h3>
<p>華南隊爲劉氏昆仲所組織。二年前尚周旋乙組隊伍中，唯以其隊員之年富力壯，不驕不餒，於是突飛猛晉，不讓老將，現更獲前輩張樂任指導，不愁支配乏人矣。該隊戰術以快稱以爽著，無格格不入之狀，精神技術，逐有進境，誠不媿後起之秀</p>
<h3>汕頭同鄉雄心非小</h3>
<p>仁餘之主將馬燦希及前鋒投籃小將林維聰，本屆均爲林作詩羅致，而隸屬於汕隊矣。按汕隊成績，本在極度進展中，今復得馬林助陣，猛虎生翼，決不可等閒視矣。預卜來日該隊比賽時，汕隊同鄉，助威必烈，依其成績而言，可與諸強隊爭一日之短長，亦有希望之一隊也。</p>
<h3>電影明星情形正常</h3>
<p>以影星姿態出演球塲，號召力較盛，然溯之該隊之球藝，因有錢旭滄之循循指導，李大深吳文超之從旁督促，隊長舒適之精神表率。以故百尺竿頭，已令球壇人士刮目相視。最近榮膺鳳凰盃冠軍，可以想見其近況焉。查該隊隊員精神富有朝氣，當有更佳之收穫。</p>
<h3>仁餘隊伍余李主持</h3>
<p>上屆在中青聯賽中喧嚇一時，正冀有所成就，不幸以林維聰馬燦希之脫幅，乃實力銳減，今不如昔矣。所餘余郇子李肇和兩大將主持中原，輔助者屬初出茅盧之小將，尚待薰陶。唯於此中得提液新人，亦大佳事。</p>
<h3>明星香水領導有人</h3>
<p>明星香水廠廠長周文璣組織之明星隊，麾下頗多健將，如沈達范熙榮王鏡湖等久負聲譽。今次並得陶紹生何孝光二好手參加，實力極見平均。筆者頗以爲該隊在聯賽中雖無問鼎中原之雄圖，然以其經騐而觀，必能予各強以威脅，而可能造冷門。領隊周仲剛對於籃球，夙有研究，故造就自多。</p>
<h3>Ｖ隊新軍子彬訓練</h3>
<p>Ｖ隊爲吳子彬一手訓練之新軍，看名單俱屬默默無名之士。過去戰績，正在乙組顚峰狀態中。這輩小英雄正求上進之時，能有此機會切磋，乃提液後進之眞意。經此聯賽之後，Ｖ隊小將，決可有成功者，可不負吳子彬一番之苦心。</p>
<h3>同仁宣家射手違和</h3>
<p>宣家班同仁隊在每賽中必最受球迷愛戴，因作戰時極盡球藝之表演，絕無半點習氣，且球藝亦在水準以上。西青聯賽中會壓倒東方及蒙諾克二隊，爲球壇增佳話。此次因射手宣俊身體欠佳，遵醫不能運動，是則獲分之總樞，將僅寄托於宣通一人之手，當比較減色。　　綜上以觀，甲組十路雄師，各有千秋。進而評之，則當以中北華聯大華汕隊並稱四大天王，錦標希望，亦以此四隊爲種子矣。然各隊之精神道德，俱皆上好，將爲申報盃造成籃球史最完滿之一頁。</p>
<h3>麥尼蒂處罰停止比賽四次三省僑聯潘主幹發表談話</h3>
<p>— 潔梅</p>
<p>最近因三省足球隊隊員之脫幅問題，以及首次福利賽僑聯隊之中途雜塲，各界議論紛紛，報間亦多述及此事。該二隊主幹人潘三省對筆者詳爲解釋。記其談話如左。　　[日前本人會談及球員隸藉問題，並對本人主辦之三省隊少數隊員突然要求脫離一節。有所表白。一語甫出，反響驟起。該隊員等在報間向各界呼籲，閱後不勝駭異。緣此次各隊員之要求改隸他隊，辭意旣堅，自不能予以強留，而足聯會方面，自有其相當之處置，豈容信口雌黃者頻加指摘。關於該隊員等所稱職業上關係，不得不去云云，實屬令人費解。蓋蹴球與職業爲兩件事，其理甚明，如必爲職業而蹴球，則養成習氣，甚至與球員業餘問題，易滋誤會，竊所不取。唯本人對此決不予以留難，亦無留難之必要，去則去矣，亦復何言。唯於純潔無瑕之球員，突爲利慾薰心所誘，乃感遺憾耳。現此事旣有足聯會諸君秉公辦理，深盼一般隊員人勿再作無謂之呼聲，徒令體壇增一裂痕也。　　又日前首次福利賽，僑聯隊中途退出，外界殊多非議。實則此次隊長麥尼蒂之率衆離塲，固有失運動精神，但麥係世運義國代表，經騐技術並臻上乘。悄然引退者，賞有其憤懣之情，裁判判斷有無失察之處，見仁見智，亦難定論。本人對該隊第二次離塲時因未便有所表示，故未再予難阻，實以麥等其時炎氣正盛，再予挽留，事實上恐未必奏效。果爾，則本人將何以自處耶。此事現已由足聯會處罰麥停止出塲比賽四次，以儆效尤。]</p>

<h3>What Exactly is the Way to Solve the Rice and Grain Problem?</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Yesterday, the *Continental Daily News* published an editorial titled "[The Essence of the Rice Problem]," criticizing the Advisory Committee's recommendations regarding the rice problem and the arguments of Chinese public opinion. Standing as a member of the Advisory Committee and a member of the press, I cannot remain silent. I wish to express my feelings with the utmost sincerity as follows:</p>
<p>The main points of the *Continental Daily News* editorial can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>*   Strengthening restrictions on the import of food grains is one of the factors stimulating rice price increases. Therefore, the Advisory Committee's recommendations reflect the demands of the people and represent their interests. However, the people only pay attention to their current lives, and their demands are often unrealistic and can even hinder unified policy implementation. However, using public opinion as a basis to attack the authorities is by no means a constructive attitude, nor is it something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities.</p>
<p>*   The most practical thing at present is how to ensure the smooth progress of purchases in the interior, and the effectiveness should be determined within three months. The day the purchase work is successful is the day the people's food in Shanghai is resolved.</p>
<p>*   If it is believed that the free import of rice and grain hinders the purchase work in the interior, then small sacrifices should be tolerated at present.</p>
<p>*   Restrict free movement to ensure the success of the current urgent purchase work, or succumb to the impatient demands of the public, resulting in the failure of the work. One of the two should be chosen.</p>
<p>*   The Advisory Committee is a bridge between the government and the citizens. If it uses public opinion as a reason to force the authorities to implement impossible recommendations, it will not only fail to be a bridge, but will also become a divider between the authorities and the people.</p>
<p>Now, I will discuss the above points:</p>
<p>Strengthening restrictions on the import of rice is enough to stimulate rice price increases. The newspaper editorial has already recognized this as a fact and as the demand of the people. So, why insist on strengthening restrictions? Why insist on stimulating price increases? Why insist on violating the demands of the people? If it is said that the people's demands only consider their current lives, and are often unrealistic and can hinder unified policy, then what is considering future life? What is realistic? What is not hindering unified policy implementation? The Rice Control Committee has been established for more than a year, and purchase work has been done more than once. Is it considering future life to sit and watch the rice price jump from several thousand yuan to more than ten thousand yuan and continue to rise? Is it realistic? Is it unified policy implementation? Historical facts are the most powerful dialectic.</p>
<p>We also know that the purpose of the Rice Control Committee strengthening restrictions is to smoothly complete the purchase work within three months. The ideal is that after the rice from the interior cannot reach Shanghai, the rice price in the interior will be cheaper, so the purchase will be profitable, and both public and private rice can be resolved. However, our purpose is exactly the same, but our ideal is not like this. Based on past experience, what we are concerned about is whether we have the confidence to achieve the following within three months: ○ sufficient amount of rationed rice. ○ accurate rationing period. ○ stabilize Shanghai's rice price. ○ stabilize the rice price in the interior. If we have these guarantees, then, let alone restricting within eight kilograms, even if the transfer is absolutely prohibited, the people will not object. We believe that without the above guarantees, then the rice price in Shanghai cannot be stabilized, then the citizens of Shanghai will suffer, and the rice price in the interior cannot be stabilized, then the ideal of cheap purchase cannot be realized. The result is that the purpose of strengthening restrictions completely fails. We look back at the fact that the rice price in Shanghai immediately fluctuated and the rice price in the interior followed suit during the past two strengthenings of restrictions, and we feel even more that strengthening restrictions on transfer is a method that cannot communicate ideals and purposes, and is not a step that should be taken in unified policy implementation. Therefore, we always feel that the method of strengthening restrictions on transfer is a risky move, where the disadvantages have already arrived, and the advantages are not necessarily present.</p>
<p>As for the arguments of the press, the editorials of the *Zhonghua Daily*, *New China Daily*, *Xin Shen Bao*, and this newspaper all unanimously believe that strengthening restrictions on transfer is inappropriate. However, Mr. Ueda, in his position as the deputy director of the Rice Control Committee, believes that it is "[seeing the trees and not the forest]," and the *Continental Daily News* editorial believes that supporting the Advisory Committee's background to attack the authorities is not a constructive attitude and is not something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities. This kind of argument inevitably disregards the facts. Is it more reasonable for a few people in the Rice Control Committee to rely on subjectively decided methods? Or is it more reasonable for the majority of the press to objectively decide the demands of the people? I think the facts can prove it, and there is no need to argue too much.</p>
<p>Our central idea is to make the government understand the suffering of the people, to ask the authorities to relieve the people of unnecessary suffering, and to make the people also understand the good intentions of the government and the good intentions of the Allied authorities. I personally believe that we are generally the most loyal to promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation. Because we value reality, tell the truth, and are even less willing to simply say "yes" or "no" without adding our own opinions, so as not to make the people resent the government, and even less to make the people misunderstand the meaning of the Allies. Those who always say "yes" or "no" to the government's policies and the Allies' policies without telling the truth are the dividers between the authorities and the people.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the Advisory Committee, the Rice Control Committee, and even the press all have the same purpose in solving the rice problem, but there are different opinions on the way to solve it. This is a public matter, not a private matter, and there should only be public reason and interests, and not emotions and anger. The attitude of the press should be especially cautious, and it should not be rash to apply words such as "divider" to others.</p>
<p>Finally, this newspaper will specially translate and publish the opinions of Mr. Ueda, the deputy director of the Coming Control Committee, and the opinions of the *Continental Daily News* editorial, even though they differ from our arguments, so that Allied personnel can refer to them. In this way, the way to solve the rice problem will be closer to a unified approach!</p>
<h3>The Essence of the Rice Problem</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee, regarding the Rice Control Committee's measures to prohibit the free import of more than eight kilograms of rice into Shanghai, has suggested to the Municipal Government to restore the free transport system within ten shi. The Chinese public opinion in Shanghai is very supportive of this proposal, and the speeches of various newspapers express their support for the Advisory Committee. This argument believes that Shanghai's rationed rice cannot meet the needs of the general public, so it has to recognize the existence of the black market rice. At the same time, if the free transport is strengthened, the result will inevitably cause the soaring of the rice price in Shanghai, which will have an adverse impact on the purchase of rice in the interior.</p>
<p>It is a fact that the strengthening of restrictions on the import of rice is one of the materials that have become the stimulus of the soaring rice price in Shanghai. At the same time, it is also very obvious that the current rationed rice is not enough for the needs of the people. From this point of view, the Advisory Committee's proposal can be said to reflect the demands of the people, and it can also be said to represent the interests of the people. However, the task of the Advisory Committee is not just to demand the authorities to adopt the demands and propositions of the people without any change. Generally speaking, the masses often only pay attention to their current lives, and what they demand is often unrealistic, and at the same time, it can sometimes hinder unified policy implementation. The suggestions on [fully increasing the rationed rice], [otherwise, easing the restrictions on mobility] are indeed direct requirements in the lives of Shanghai citizens, but this kind of proposition is based on the support of public opinion to attack the authorities. It is by no means a constructive attitude, nor is it something that should be done in cooperation with the authorities.</p>
<p>At this moment, the most urgent and practical thing about the rice problem is how to make the purchase in the interior proceed smoothly; and this purchase problem must be decided within three months, so the problem is very urgent. All efforts must be put into promoting the work, and the day the purchase work is carried out smoothly and successfully will also be the day when the problem of people's food in Shanghai is solved. If we believe that the free import of rice and grain hinders the purchase work in the interior, then although small sacrifices are tolerated at present, only cooperating with the authorities' policies is the real constructive method and practical attitude, because in reality, there cannot be policies that do not contain some contradictions and shortcomings. Regarding the rice problem, either the current urgent purchase work can be successful, or it will succumb to the impatient demands of the public, so that the work will end in failure. One of the two should be chosen.</p>
<p>The Advisory Committee must be a good bridge between the government and the citizens of Shanghai. If it ignores reality, does not consider the environment, and forces the authorities to implement impossible proposals simply because of the support of public opinion, it will not only fail to become a good bridge, but will also become a divider between the authorities and the people. For all suggestions and proposals, no matter how reasonable they are on the surface, we must think about them, and consider and deal with them in the context of overall policy implementation, so that they can be changed into realistically possible proposals. The proposition of relying solely on the name of public opinion to put the authorities in a difficult situation is not what we should adopt. (Translated from the *Continental Daily News*, October 7)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Declares His Determination and Urges Cabinet Members to Promote Policies and Work Together to Complete the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Pacific war situation has now entered an important stage that will determine the rise and fall of Japan, so it is necessary to develop strong war policies. Regarding this point, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso called the attention of all cabinet members at the cabinet meeting held on the 6th, in order to implement the imminent decisive battle, and declared his firm determination as follows: The situation is becoming more and more urgent. As of today, we are at the stage of decisive battle. Naturally, we should not focus on the organizational structure, but in order to complete the war, if there are obstacles, we should actively and boldly overcome the difficulties in the organizational structure and personnel, so that strong policies can be promoted. What I hope for in the future is that cabinet members should exchange opinions frankly with each other. In the past, although we have gained understanding among cabinet members, it is inevitable that there have been regrets that things could not be thoroughly promoted in terms of affairs. Regarding this point, I hope that all cabinet members will work together with one heart and one mind to complete the war and the prosperity of the Empire.</p>
<h3>The Supreme Policy-Making Body Will Be Established Soon</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Supreme War Guidance Council not only decides the supreme policy for guiding the war, but also decides the supreme policy for all policies that are indispensable for completing the war, such as politics and diplomacy. This has already been made clear by what Prime Minister Koiso announced at the previous temporary meeting. However, how to specifically implement the already decided supreme policy was only limited to planning to establish an appropriate organization in the cabinet at that time. Now it is learned that at the cabinet meeting on the 6th, Prime Minister Koiso specifically emphasized the following three points: ○ In terms of the strategic situation, although it is appropriate to adopt a policy of not changing the organization, the necessary reforms of the organization should be carried out to carry out the war. ○ Regarding the operation of policies, it is planned to carry out strong and bold implementation. ○ In the past, things that have been completely understood among cabinet members may not have been thoroughly implemented by the administrative authorities or the lowest-level organizations. Due to the above explanation by Prime Minister Koiso, the administrative organizations of the army and navy will become simpler and more powerful in terms of military production in the future, and the preparations for production mobilization, the thorough implementation of the policy of increasing military food production, and the simplification of the lowest-level administration that has the closest contact with the public, and the streamlining of administrative affairs will be resolutely implemented. From Prime Minister Koiso's words, it can be seen that the Japanese organization for specifically implementing the supreme policy decided by the Supreme War Guidance Council will be established soon.</p>
<h3>Japanese Headquarters Announces Japanese Army Occupies Fuzhou</h3>
<p>The U.S. Admits that the Japanese Army is Approaching Guilin</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 7th that the Japanese army, which was attacking Fuzhou, defeated the stubbornly resisting Yu's 80th Division in the established positions around the city, and completely occupied Fuzhou City on the 4th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) After the Japanese army launched a surprise landing operation near Daijiang, 40 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou, on September 27, they captured Lianjiang, an important and dangerous road, on the 28th, pointing directly to the Yu army south of Fuzhou. They formed a solid defense line within a radius of two li around Fuzhou, with the 70th Army (Commander Chen Kongda) and the 80th Division (Division Commander Li Liangzi) as the mainstay, stubbornly holding on and launching an ambush against the Japanese army. The Japanese army gradually approached the defense line on October 2, and after starting the attack in the morning, successively implemented day attacks and night surprise attacks. On the afternoon of the 3rd, they occupied Banling (8 kilometers northeast of Fuzhou), and on the 4th, they broke through Zhonglun Mountain (5 kilometers southeast of Fuzhou). The Japanese army was like an angry wave, rushing to the Fuzhou plain in one breath, and completely occupied the streets of Fuzhou at 8:00 on the 4th. In addition, the Japanese army's separate detachments also successively occupied Wuhu Island (20 kilometers east of Fuzhou), at the mouth of the Minjiang River, and Wuke Island to the north. At the moment, the Japanese army is carrying out a mopping-up operation. Fuzhou is a base for enemy American submarines, so the occupation of this port is extremely noteworthy. This time, because the Japanese army preemptively launched an operation, their attempt has been completely crushed. The Japanese army's control over the east coast of China has now been completed, and maritime transportation in the Greater East Asia Sea is guaranteed, so the US military's plan to land on the Chinese mainland has completely failed.</p>

According to various sources, they are now approaching an area 20 kilometers away from Guilin. At the same time, the Danzhu US Air Force base south of Guilin was lost due to the Japanese army's westward advance from Guangdong. However, the US 14th Air Force is still working hard to actively hinder the Japanese army's operations.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Front Line, 6th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army attacked the first line of defense, Xing'an City, which defended Guilin, from the east, west, and north, and occupied it at dawn on the 1st, and continued to advance south.

At present, the most important issues for the promoters of the construction of North China are increasing production and transportation. He also asked the Japanese expatriates to seek to understand the hearts of the Chinese people with the Japanese sense of morality. The next concern is that the domestic food harvest in Japan this year may reach the average annual harvest, but there is no need to worry because of the bumper harvest in Manchuria. Beiping, 7th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Takeuchi, Undersecretary of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, who came here, visited the Supreme Commander of the Japanese North China Army at 10:00 a.m. on the 6th to exchange greetings after his visit and inquire about the security situation in North China.

<h3>Police Bureau Chiefs Lü and Li Respond to Police Administration Questions</h3>
<p>22nd Regular Press Conference Held Yesterday. The Municipal Propaganda Department convened the 22nd regular press conference yesterday, where Lü Qi, Administrative Chief of the First Police Bureau, and Li Shiyu, Judicial Chief, answered various questions raised by reporters.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Police Extortion</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Question) Police often exploit their authority to extort money from citizens, especially traffic police. Is the authorities aware of this, and what effective measures are being taken to prevent it? (Administrative Chief Answer) The issue of police extortion and the unauthorized actions of traffic police in arbitrarily inspecting pedestrians was discovered six months ago. It has been discussed during administrative meetings. A diligent traffic police officer would have no time to interfere in extraneous matters. Otherwise, regardless of the motive, it is an overreach of authority. The Bureau has ordered all branches to thoroughly investigate and report on this issue to facilitate punishment. At the same time, we sincerely hope that citizens can assist us. If they discover traffic police interfering in matters outside of traffic control, such as arbitrarily questioning pedestrians, they can record the location, time, and police number and report it to the Bureau. We will investigate and rectify the situation strictly to maintain law and order and protect the welfare of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Operating Past Hours</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Question) The authorities have restricted the operating hours of entertainment venues to conserve electricity. Why are some dance halls still operating past hours, even until dawn? (Administrative Chief Answer) The Police Bureau has been handling the restriction of entertainment venue operating hours in three stages to conserve electricity. Initially, the closing time was set at midnight, then at 10 PM. However, it became increasingly difficult to enforce. If the police enforced it too strictly, it would have a significant impact on their business. However, we cannot simply ignore the regulations and allow them to operate freely. Therefore, the Bureau initially adopted a persuasive approach, appealing to them to voluntarily comply. The second step was to take strict measures and crack down on violations. We have now entered the crackdown phase, and the Bureau will strictly enforce the regulations. In the past, we delegated the enforcement to the branch offices. In the future, we will further assign personnel to conduct spot checks. However, due to limited staff, we may not be able to cover all locations. Recently, we received reports that some entertainment venues have installed police alarms or assigned lookouts to notify the premises when police officers approach, allowing them to conceal the violations. The Bureau is currently investigating and cracking down on these practices.</p>
<h3>Judicial Police Using Torture</h3>
<p>(China Daily Question) The responsibility of the police is to protect the people. They should use peaceful methods to persuade and admonish in all situations. However, many police officers in this city still retain the bad habits of former constables, resorting to beatings at the slightest provocation. Furthermore, there are still instances of private torture within the police detective squads. We hope the police authorities will take steps to improve this. (Judicial Chief Answer) Since the takeover of the concessions, the Bureau has been making every effort to rectify this. We have repeatedly warned police officers. The extent of improvement is clear to everyone. As for the detectives, we have been working hard to rectify all aspects, including personnel and operations, for the past year. The Judicial Police, under the Judicial Office, are constantly focused on handling everything related to the safety and security of the people's lives and property, as well as the maintenance of the law, and strive for simplicity and efficiency. We are doing our best to instill legal knowledge, provide investigative skills training, and supervise the conduct of our staff. Regarding the issue of using torture, we will thoroughly investigate and hope that citizens will report such incidents.</p>
<h3>Extortion by Police at Suzhou Creek Docks</h3>
<p>(China Daily Question) Police officers stationed at bridgeheads and docks along the Suzhou Creek, such as the Tianhou Temple, openly obstruct and extort money from pedestrians carrying non-controlled prohibited items. Does the police authorities have any measures to address this? (Administrative Chief and Judicial Chief Answer) The Bureau had heard of the aforementioned situation as early as February. We have ordered all branch offices to strictly crack down on it. We have also been dispatching personnel to conduct regular inspections. At the same time, we sincerely hope that citizens can assist the authorities to achieve twice the results with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement Suspects Escorted to Beijing</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Question) We have heard that important suspects in the embezzlement case have been escorted to Beijing for interrogation. Could you please provide information on the progress of the case and disclose the names of those escorted to Beijing for interrogation? (Judicial Chief Answer) Regarding this case, the police are only responsible for the investigation, which is confidential and cannot be disclosed. This is clear to everyone. After the investigation is completed, the case will be transferred to a special court in Beijing for trial. To my knowledge, the trial can be either public or private, and whether it is disclosed or not is not determined by this office.</p>
<h3>Degree of Reduction in Crime Cases</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Question) Since the establishment of the Crime Prevention Section, what has been the effect of its work, and to what extent has crime decreased compared to before? (Judicial Chief Answer) Since its establishment several months ago, the Crime Prevention Section has not had a significant impact due to the complexity of society in this city. As for the extent to which crime has decreased, there are no clear figures yet. We are currently in the planning and development stage.</p>

<h3>Inspection Notes Along the Hangzhou-Ningbo Highway</h3>
<p>- By Our Correspondent Liu Hanru</p>
<p>○ The Rich Eastern Zhejiang - From crossing the river at Zhakou, through Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, to Ningbo, along the highway for more than three hundred li, the fields are filled with ripening rice, stretching endlessly as far as the eye can see, showing that Eastern Zhejiang is a rich rice-producing area. According to farmers, the rice harvest in Eastern Zhejiang is slightly later than in other places, generally around the end of the eighth lunar month, similar to the late rice harvest in southern and northern Anhui. Cotton is a specialty of Yuyao, with very high yields. It is said that the value of cotton clothing that can be exported this year is over 100 million yuan. Therefore, Yuyao's affluence is also the highest among the counties in Eastern Zhejiang, with Shaoxing's wine and tinfoil being the roots of Eastern Zhejiang's economic prosperity. As the vehicle enters Shaoxing County, the houses on both sides are all tiled houses, built on stone foundations that are very high, constructed along the water. Several willow trees grow next to the houses, swaying in the wind. Occasionally, several sailboats sail with the wind, the boatmen holding long pipes, steering and sailing leisurely. Three or five village children either lie on the backs of cattle or play by the creek, and farmers bow their heads to cultivate. Hearing the sound of cars, they all stand up to watch. The frightened cattle scatter in a panic, and the mischievous children clap their hands, greatly amused. This scene is truly delightful and makes one forget the troubled world. Shaoxing is famous for its wine production, and Shaoxing wine is world-renowned. Tin foil, silk, patterned gauze, fragrant cakes, fermented bean curd, etc., are all famous products of Shaoxing. Therefore, Shaoxing not only has a good output in agriculture, but its commerce is also very prosperous, comparable to the port of Ningbo. Taro and cotton are also produced in large quantities in Xiaoshan. Eastern Zhejiang is indeed a very prosperous region.</p>
<p>○ People's Livelihood in Distress - Eastern Zhejiang is known as a prosperous region, so the people's livelihood should be relatively affluent. However, because the people are being excessively exploited, their livelihood is unbearable and extremely difficult. According to inquiries: The government collects 35 catties of grain per mu of farmland in Eastern Zhejiang. However, the old regime outside the peaceful area also collects 35 to 25 catties per mu. This is the regular tax. In addition, local troops and layers of tax collectors take advantage of the situation to impose additional taxes. As a result of this excessive taxation, the farmers only receive a small portion of their production. This small portion must cover the food for the entire family and the cost of cultivation. Therefore, when discussing their economic situation with farmers, they all shake their heads and sigh, lamenting their suffering. The farmers' grain income, in addition to paying various official taxes, cannot be freely disposed of. They must also sell to the government at a fixed price for both official rice purchases and military rice purchases. After selling, they have to buy rice back at a high price to eat. Other daily necessities such as soap, matches, and cloth must also be bought at high prices. What is grown in their own fields is not worth much, but what they need to eat, wear, and use must be bought at high prices. Farmers cannot help but express their resentment when discussing this matter! In fact, we also know that this situation is not unique to Eastern Zhejiang. Other places also have similar situations, or perhaps Eastern Zhejiang is even worse. The price of rice in various places along the Hangzhou line is mostly around four to five thousand yuan per dan. People's food consists of half taro and half rice. Taro costs about five yuan per catty, which is not much cheaper than in Beijing and Shanghai. The security situation in the Eastern Zhejiang area, after the village cleansing, seems to be fine in points and lines. Apart from cities and large towns, there are traces of guerrillas, bandits, and [Three-Five Detachments] in most places. The truly wealthy villagers have moved to the cities, and those who are not in good condition live under multiple ruling classes, struggling to survive.</p>
<p>○ The Life of Civil Servants - On this trip, I met several military and local officials, such as the outgoing Governor Chuan, Shaoxing Administrative Commissioner Bu Yumin, Ningbo Administrative Commissioner Tao Xiaojie, Yin County Magistrate Qin Yaxiu, and Xie Wenda, the commander of the Tenth Division stationed in Eastern Zhejiang. After discussing with these military and political officials, we learned something about the living conditions of general civil servants. Generally speaking, the life of civil servants in Eastern Zhejiang is still passable. The biggest reason is that they have rationed rice for themselves and their families. Each person and family member has more than three dou of rationed rice, allocated according to the number of people. There is no problem with the rice supply until the end of the year. Firewood only sells for 1.5 yuan per catty in Ningbo. With rice secured and firewood cheap, other problems are easily solved. Therefore, the life of general lower-level civil servants is much better than in Beijing and Shanghai. Middle and upper-level civil servants, such as important administrative officials below political officials, like section chiefs and above, seem to be living a very decadent life. Those with power in [individual units] live very lavishly. In the [flower] dens in the back market of Ningbo, those who seek pleasure, in addition to profiteering merchants, are this large group of middle and upper-level military and political civil servants and those with power, toasting and drinking, gambling and carousing. We believe that these people know very well the reasons for the suffering of the general public in Eastern Zhejiang and should bear the majority of the responsibility.</p>
<p>○ Conscience Politics - Ningbo Administrative Commissioner Tao Xiaojie once told reporters: [I often warn my subordinates that although our salaries are not enough to live on, the standard for making money should not exceed what is necessary for ordinary life. If we live a luxurious life and still try to squeeze money, then we have no conscience]. (Roughly meaning). At the same time, Xie Wenda, the commander of the Tenth Division in Ningbo, also told reporters: [The military pay issued by the higher authorities is not enough for the soldiers' rations for a few days. The insufficient amount is all maintained by me personally. My method of maintaining the soldiers' lives is to make them [warmly clothed and well-fed]. Raising funds should be done in a way that does not disturb the people or harm national taxes. My soldiers will never ask the people for a penny. I use [business and production] methods to raise funds to support the soldiers. At the same time, I use six words to train the officers and soldiers, which are [with conscience, take responsibility]]. Both Tao and Xie are the highest-ranking military and political officials in Eastern Zhejiang. We believe in their personalities and deeply believe that they can implement their conscientious political views. (End of the full text)</p>

<h3>The Valor of the Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific</h3>
<p>At the base of the Japanese Army Air Force in the Southwest Pacific, every day is tense. They do not let any good opportunity slip by, always prepared to seize it and annihilate the enemy. Under the battle clouds, the Japanese Army Air Force in the Southwest Pacific has long been preparing for a general offensive. Once the opportunity arrives, they will unleash their might. Here is a brief report on the recent situation of the Japanese eagles in the Southwest Pacific, showing how they are fiercely flying and fighting in the new offensive.</p>
<h3>New Reconnaissance Squadron</h3>
<p>To defeat enemy aircraft, it is necessary to fully understand the enemy's situation first. The enemy's air power in the Southwest Pacific is moving under the protection of bad weather in the steep and inaccessible mountains. Therefore, the Japanese reconnaissance aircraft must brave the cumulonimbus clouds and soar over the monstrous Stanley Mountains to search carefully. Their hard work is beyond description. This battle-tested unit honorably received an award during the first attack on Australia. Their sharp eyes will never let enemy aircraft slip away. Coinciding with the establishment of the Second European Front, enemy four-engine large aircraft suddenly disappeared around Australia and New Guinea. The discovery of this situation was the great action of the New Reconnaissance Squadron. When attempting to launch a counteroffensive in the Pacific, there were 300 B24s on Lorengau Island in the Admiralty Islands, 200 P38s and others in Dutch New Guinea, about 100 in Wakde, and 150-60 small aircraft in Australia, totaling about 800 aircraft. As the New Guinea operation progressed, the B24s advanced further to Biak Island, but because of the fierce attacks by the Japanese bomber squadron, many of the precious large aircraft were lost. Therefore, they were frightened and had no choice but to move these large aircraft back and forth, even though it caused some inconvenience in the operation. All of this was detected by Japanese reconnaissance aircraft. One day, Captain Sasaki flew over the Stanley Mountains and returned from reconnaissance of a certain enemy base in New Guinea. He saw only white clouds floating above the mountain peaks. When a certain mountain, whose peak is often invisible, faintly appeared on the left, it was suddenly enveloped by cumulonimbus clouds. The aircraft was hit by severe turbulence and spiraled down, two hundred meters, three hundred meters. The canopy above his head was also torn off. Captain Sasaki knew things were going badly and made a final struggle to break through the dangerous situation. In the mountains, where his vision was blocked by the cumulonimbus clouds, he boldly made a steep descent. At this time, his vision suddenly cleared, and he realized that the aircraft was flying over the valley in the booklet. Captain Sasaki then followed the valley, passed through the clouds, and looked down, unexpectedly finding the enemy base. He immediately calmly reconnoitered and then returned along the same route. At this time, the cumulonimbus clouds in the valley had dissipated, and Captain Sasaki took the opportunity to conduct a thorough meteorological reconnaissance. In this way, he completely solved its secrets and finally conquered the monstrous Stanley Mountains, which had swallowed many comrades. Now, the New Reconnaissance Squadron knows the terrain and meteorology of the Southwest Pacific like the back of their hand and continues to be active in preparation for the offensive.</p>
<h3>Military Reconnaissance Squadron</h3>
<p>The military reconnaissance squadron's active stage was originally the main battlefield of the mainland operation. This entry into the ocean is indeed unprecedented. Because they are rich in practical experience, they are quite able to innovate. Therefore, although they have not been active at sea for long, they are competent in performing tasks such as escorting convoys, commanding communications, bombing, and intercepting. In addition to sinking and destroying eleven enemy submarines and shooting down three enemy aircraft, they have also won seven awards for their meritorious escort of convoys. They have established such remarkable military achievements in the Pacific shortly after their deployment. Captain Shimada of the Maritime Military Reconnaissance Squadron was about to land at a certain base on August 8th when he suddenly encountered a formation of enemy P38s attacking the base. Captain Shimada immediately abandoned the idea of landing and decided to intercept them with a single aircraft. He turned the nose of the aircraft and suddenly rushed into the enemy aircraft formation. The enemy aircraft hastily opened fire. Captain Shimada, known as the authority on model aircraft, had superb piloting skills. The enemy aircraft formation was disrupted by his冲 and 撞, their bullets were wasted, and they had no choice but to return empty-handed. Captain Shimada had also run out of bullets and was about to return to base. Unfortunately, at this time, a new batch of enemy fighter aircraft came. As a result, Captain Shimada, who intercepted more than 30 enemy aircraft with a single aircraft, died heroically in the southern sky. Now, the warriors of the Maritime Military Reconnaissance Squadron are gearing up, determined to avenge their captain.</p>
<h3>Bomber Squadron</h3>
<p>To counter the enemy's delusions of a general counter-offensive, the Japanese bomber squadron avoids unnecessary attrition, seizes every opportunity to strike at the enemy's key points, and destroys their various forces with clever tactics. Upon receiving reports of enemy troop concentrations, it immediately dispatches a small number of bombers at night to drop precise heavy bombs. For example, in the recent attack on Wakde, Biak, a few Japanese bombers single-handedly annihilated more than ten times the number of enemy aircraft, while the Japanese side did not lose a single plane. MacArthur stated that, with the acquisition of bases such as Matang, Hollandia, and Biak, the operations around New Guinea have completely ended. However, the ingenious tactics employed by the Japanese bomber squadron force the enemy to go to great lengths to gather aircraft at suitable bases, and even if they are assembled temporarily, half of them must be constantly engaged in patrol flights. Unable to withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese aircraft, they even resorted to distributing leaflets urging [mutual cessation of night bombing].</p>
<h3>Fighter Squadron</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, aerial heroes have emerged one after another. In the past, there was Hayabusa Nangō, and more recently, there was Fighter Group Commander Takada. Under this tradition of immortal glory, the members of the Japanese fighter squadron active in the Southwest Pacific are continuing the fighting spirit of their fallen comrades, fighting bravely. Countless tragic stories abound, but let's just take the most recent one as an example. This incident occurred at a Japanese base at the tip of New Guinea. On that day, as usual, enemy aircraft arrived on time to harass, consisting of sixty P38s and B25s. The B25 formation flew in to launch a surprise attack from the shade of the mangrove forest sheltering the base at an ultra-low altitude of five to ten meters. At this time, the Japanese aircraft had already shot down more than half of the enemy planes. The enemy aircraft encountered by Sergeant Major Nakamura, unwilling to engage, hurriedly fled. Sergeant Major Nakamura wanted to pursue them, but it was too late. Just as he was feeling annoyed, he happened to see a B25 returning from strafing the ground. He immediately dove his aircraft and charged. Surprised, the enemy aircraft hurriedly raised its nose, intending to climb steeply. Unexpectedly, its tail dipped into the sea at that moment, and it was dragged down by the waves. Sergeant Major Nakamura found the enemy aircraft's predicament both amusing and irritating; amusing because it had tried to escape but instead perished, and irritating because he could not engage in a satisfying battle. In the blink of an eye, Sergeant Major Nakamura had already turned his aircraft and was rapidly approaching another one from the rear and above. The enemy aircraft was unaware of the danger behind it and was rapidly descending on a Japanese aircraft. Just as it was about to open fire, it discovered Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft behind it. Unable to escape in time, it plunged into the sea in a steep dive. Sergeant Major Nakamura, pursuing too closely, could not stop in time and followed the enemy aircraft, disappearing into the sea together. In this critical moment, Sergeant Major Nakamura fully pulled back the control stick. At this time, the ground troops watching Sergeant Major Nakamura pursue the enemy aircraft ran towards the beach, believing that Sergeant Major Nakamura had perished with the enemy. Unexpectedly, sea spray splashed, and Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft suddenly leaped out of the sea, flew to an altitude of about one hundred meters, and leisurely flew to the airfield, landing on the runway. Everyone who saw it was dumbfounded, stunned for a long time. The miracle of shooting down two enemy aircraft without firing a single bullet and surviving underwater. Therefore, when Sergeant Major Nakamura's aircraft landed safely, the base erupted in cheers, praising his vigorous fighting spirit and miraculous skill (Fukuoka Special Correspondent).

<h3>The Story of a Violin</h3>
<p>— By Merrill</p>
<p>[The time has finally come, old friend, the time has finally come—the time when you and I must say goodbye. God knows; I would rather sell myself to replace you, but I am worthless, yet you—do you know, my beloved? A merchant down the street, a man who has everything I have (except you), will give me five hundred dollars if I give you to him. He will give five hundred dollars to a poor wretch who is unclothed, unsheltered, and without even a piece of bread! Why do I hesitate? You are just a few pieces of wood and a few worthless strings, not worth starving for. I just need to take you downstairs—take a few more steps—put you on the counter, and that's it, I'll have five hundred dollars! I can leave this dilapidated garret, I'll have food to eat, which I haven't tasted for a year! I can mingle with a group of wealthy acquaintances, and I'll become one of them. Five hundred dollars! Ah, that's a fortune, a considerable fortune! All for you, you gutless thing, you don't know hunger, you, you soulless shell. No, wait! Am I sure?] The man plucked the strings of the Guarnerius with his finger and lowered his head to listen, the soft sound waves like sweet, blurred memories. [Your E string is a little low,] the man said, [well, that doesn't matter.] Overwhelmed by a sudden decision, he hastily stood up, opened the violin case, and threw the Guarnerius into it. He hesitated again, the faint sound of the instrument vaguely audible, as if a painful groan. The man picked up the Guarnerius again, cradled it in his arm, and pressed his cheek against it. [What, old friend, did I hurt you? Ah! I mistreated you, you do have a soul, I even believe you can remember?] [Let me think, how long has it been? Twenty, thirty, thirty-five years, we have spent most of our lives together, and before that, I had already known you. You were in an old goods store, the person who kept you had been with you even longer. Whenever someone came, he would show you to them, let them see your mark [Cremona, 1731], but he was unwilling to sell you, perhaps because he had not yet tasted hunger. I loved you then, loved this wooden, lifeless thing. I loved to hold you, listen to you sing, I yearned to have you—I had never yearned for anything before.] [One day, the old man gave you to me. [[Give me your old violin,] he said, [and you can take my Cremona!] [[Take it?] I exclaimed. [[Yes,] the old man said, [take it! Because I am sure you will take good care of it. I am old, others will take possession of it, the Cremona will surely fall into the hands of strangers, I don't want that to happen, I would rather give it to you.] [So I took you home, sat up half the night, gently drawing the bow across your strings. I was truly the happiest person in the world, I thought. I put you where I could touch you as soon as I woke up in the morning, not even a kingdom would I trade you for! But, I wasn't hungry then!] The man still held the violin, pressed against his cheek, tenderly plucking the strings, as if talking to himself in the night, seemingly unaware of what he was saying. [Thirty-five years, we have witnessed the world together, we have tasted joy and sorrow together, emperors, beggars, all have listened to you, loved you.] [Do you still remember that night in Berlin? When we were playing [Dream], that beautiful woman in the box on the right threw down a large rose, it caught on the strings—a thorn caught on the strings. When I tried to take it off, the blood-red petals fell at my feet, and so I played [The Last Rose of Summer]. I am sure you had a soul that night, I felt your heart trembling with the vibration of your strings. At the end of the piece, people's eyes were filled with tears, and she, music had possessed her, I thought. She stood up, shouting: [No, no! This is not the last rose, the world is full of roses, look!] She threw down a large bouquet of red and white flowers. [I wondered if she loved me more or you? When the roses (all the roses in the world) were in bloom, she faded away sadly. You must still remember these things, old friend! When it was dark, the others left her body and left, we went to say goodbye to her. At that time, the world was full of roses, and I placed them on her grave, and then you began to sing. Ah! How touchingly you sang! I often believed that your soul carried the fragrance of roses and spread it in your songs. Later, when we were performing, someone threw down a rose, I stepped on it. When she had disappeared, what right did roses have to bloom again?] [From that time on, our lives went bad, there was nothing in the world to fight for, and you became even more precious, because you were the only one who understood me. I even said you had no soul, forgive me, old friend! A person's words when hungry should not be condemned?] [Ah, what a foolish thing I am! Stop rambling on about an old violin, I must fill my empty stomach!] The man resolutely stood up, rudely placed the Guarnerius in the case, slammed the lid shut, picked it up, hesitated again, listening to the strings vibrating from the rough tossing. He heard a sigh, as faint as the last breath of farewell exhaled from the lips of a dead lover. The man took a distressed step, then another, and stopped abruptly, grabbing the violin and holding it in his hands. [No, no, I can't, I can't! I don't want to! I may be—I must be—I must be crazy, but I don't want to do this anyway, I'm not hungry anymore—] The man opened the case and picked up the violin again, holding it in his arms like a child. [I dreamed of selling you, my baby! But a demon tempted me! The demon of hunger, now it's gone, I'm very happy, very content. Come, sing me a song, I'm really happy.] The man raised the Guarnerius and drew the bow. [Ah, this E string is much better, now we are both well, we are happy, aren't we? Sing her roses for me, look! She's in that box over there, in the flowers, she's smiling, she's throwing bouquets at us, red ones. While she's listening, we must do our best, all the strength we have.] Bright eyes flashing with brilliance, pale cheeks flushed with red, hunger and annoyance had been banished to the distant clouds, things already forgotten. He was again the master of music, the garret room had gradually expanded... expanded into a magnificent concert hall, where thousands of distinguished guests sat, holding their breath under the sacred, harmonious sounds. His own soul was breathing on the strings, and people were moved, trembling with weeping, swaying with wild laughter, they were shouting loudly. [Listen! Listen! My companion!] The man shouted: [Good! Once more! Ah! Tonight we have conquered the world, how brightly the light shines! This is ecstasy—this is heaven!] The music sounded louder and louder, the bow moved faster and faster. Snap! A string broke, snap—another string! Transcendental syllables. Subsided into a sad whisper, the hand holding the bow became unsteady; the coarse gaze stopped its feverish flickering, focusing on a point to the right, the tense expression relaxed into a smile, the voice was low and slender! [Another rose, my beauty! My peerless beauty! The light is dim, my vision is blurred, I can only see you, only you!] Crack! The last string also broke. (Translated by Qi Luo)</p>
<h3>Recommendation of [Long Live Teachers]—An Introduction for Those Concerned About Education</h3>
<p>— Lin Qiu</p>
<p>○...Recently, I had an extremely pleasant experience, which was seeing a good play and a good movie—[Jin Xiaoyu] and [Long Live Teachers]. [Jin Xiaoyu] (performed with great effort) can be said to be a work of [equal skill and strength] in the recent theatrical scene, whether in terms of writing, directing, or acting; and [Long Live Teachers] is a rare good movie in recent years. ○...As the title suggests, this film is based on the lives of teachers and truthfully exposes a corner of the rotten elementary school education in Shanghai, the hardships of teachers' lives, and also depicts a group of people working hard for this sacred cause in extremely difficult circumstances. War is a kind of ruthless destruction. On the one hand, we must try our best to make effective sacrifices, and on the other hand, we must try our best to make possible arrangements. The problem of education is a major issue in cultivating vitality. The enthusiastic support and generous donations from all parties to the student aid movement organized by Shen Bao in previous years are proof of the importance that people in society attach to this reality. However, [Long Live Teachers], as a film that is a part of cultural activities, can be so closely connected to reality, and express it in a very concrete and very moving way with mature art, cannot but be said to be an innovation. ○...We have seen Mr. Sang Hu, the writer and director of [Long Live Teachers], in his previous films [Flesh], [Wedding Night], [Meeting After Dusk], and [I Am Originally Sick]. Although he made appeals in each of his works, what was even more dazzling was the moving story. [Long Live Teachers] is the only example of being able to convey the author's thoughts so clearly and descriptively, following the intended goal. But our author is subtle, so he used such a light touch to write about such a major issue. It is light, but intimate, so that people do not feel awkward or heavy. The author's creative tendency can be especially seen in the depiction of the characters. These characters have some of the author's ideal colors, but they are all vivid and flesh-and-blood images. They are all very ordinary, with their upward mobility, but also with their shortcomings. They are human beings, not gods, even the dancer Zhang Nana, who is wandering in the mud, is just a [spiritual person] who cannot be said to be absent. ○...What is surprising is the author's directing skills. It is said that [Long Live Teachers] is Mr. Sang Hu's directorial debut, and from this, we can see the depth of the author's cultivation. The whole film progresses harmoniously, like flowing clouds and flowing water, natural and light, and the author's talent shines everywhere. Even the most subtle places are not let go. One point that can be specially mentioned about its unique technique is the [dissolve] between the scenes throughout the film. Such a bold attempt, and being able to do it so smoothly and freely, seems to be unseen in Chinese films in my shallow experience. ○...The author would like to recommend [Long Live Teachers] to audiences who love film art with great joy, and introduce it to people who care about education issues.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Listening to the Sino-Western Music Charity Performance</h3>
<p>— Shu Jun</p>
<p>The unprecedented Sino-Western music performance has ended yesterday! Of course, this performance is related to the fate of many students going to school, but at the same time, it can also inspire people in this city full of decadent music to have a little awareness of proper entertainment. In particular, national music, it is the national quintessence that has been handed down for thousands of years, but in recent years it has become like a lonely orchid in an empty valley, gradually withering due to being not valued by people! This time, with the efforts of well-intentioned people such as the National Music Research Association, it is blooming again with colorful colors! When I was sitting in the Lyceum and quietly listening to the performance, my heart and soul were also floating with the melodious and moving music! Although I am not Zhou Lang who cares about the music at the banquet, I would like to use the line [This song should only be in heaven, how can it be heard a few times in the world] to praise him. Everyone who has listened to the performance cannot say that it is an exaggeration, right? Especially Mr. Sun Yude's pipa is really playing with superb skills. The sentence [Big beads and small beads falling on a jade plate] in Bai Juyi's Pipa Xing is really not an exaggeration to describe it. The clear and melodious sound of the pipa deeply harmonized with my heartstrings, and I was completely intoxicated! There is also Mr. Zhang Ziqian's guqin, which is elegant and detached from the mundane. It is said that, like Mr. Sun's pipa, he has worked hard for more than twenty years, so it is no wonder that his reputation is famous at home and abroad, and it is by no means accidental. During the ensemble of various instruments, the sound is harmonious, melodious and moving, and there are no drawbacks of noise, unevenness, and disharmony. Perhaps some people say that national music is too monotonous and not as complicated as Western music, but I believe that the beauty of music lies in being able to move people and arouse inner resonance in the audience. If we only use the simplicity and complexity of notes to determine the entire art, it would be too [measuring the sea with a dipper]. In short, I feel that national music has both the desolation and generosity of tragedy, and the gentleness of clearness and moving, it is really a myriad of changes in the orchestra! It is the supreme holy product for cultivating temperament, and it is also the treasure of ancient oriental countries. I hope that the Chinese people who love good music will work hard to discover it, promote it, and carry it forward!</p>

<h3>Introduction to the Ten Powerful Teams in the Shen Bao Cup Basketball League A Division</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League, organized by this newspaper, has been in preparation for more than a month. Thanks to the enthusiastic support from all parties, it is all ready. And the curtain was raised the night before last (the 6th) in the gymnasium of the Japanese Army Dormitory, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Because the venue is suitable, it is expected that there will be even more grand occasions in the future. According to this time, all ten teams in Group A are invited, and Group B will first accept registration, and then select and record according to circumstances. As a result, 76 teams registered. Due to the problem of venue allocation, the authorities had no choice but to record only 36 teams, divided into 16 divisions for competition. The committee authorities expressed deep apologies to the teams that were not recorded. At the time of the opening of the curtain, a brief introduction to the strength and tactics of the ten strong teams in Group A is made to serve as a guide for fans.</p>
<h3>Abundant Talents in the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>
<p>This team is organized by colleagues from the Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory. In the last Xiqing League, they won the championship in one fell swoop, shocking the basketball world. The players are all veterans of the arena, and fans are already familiar with Qu Xilin and Kong Guangyi. What makes them superior is that they can see the enemy's weaknesses and launch attacks. Today's basketball games have progressed to the use of tactics to win. The team's tactics are diverse and can be said to be unique in Shanghai, which should be attributed to the brain of the instructor Zhang Weixiang.</p>
<h3>Zhongbei Military Team is the Male of the Northern School</h3>
<p>Zhongbei is very popular among fans in Shanghai. This time, in addition to the original team, such as Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yugong, and Li Baozhong, they also invited the famous guard Zhuo Guorong to help. Zhuo's style is known for being fierce and powerful, which is the same as Zhongbei's ball style, and it will be even more exciting. It is expected that this northern school army will have a very satisfactory masterpiece in the Shen Bao Cup</p>
<h3>Dahua Recruits Old Soldiers</h3>
<p>Under the planning of Yang Shuding, Dahua has recruited soldiers and sold horses this time. Zhang Banglun, a dual-purpose talent in football and basketball, and Zhang Jinxuan, a former famous general of Hualian, came to join him after hearing the news. And old soldiers such as Lu Zhongen, Xu Wenkui, Feng Nianhua, and Zhen Xianglong rose again. The lineup is neat. Its future will be brilliant, and the past glory of Paramount can be easily seen in this Dahua team.</p>
<h3>Huanan Liu's Rising Star</h3>
<p>The Huanan team is organized by the Liu brothers. Two years ago, they were still in the B team, but because their team members are young and strong, not arrogant or impetuous, they have made rapid progress, not letting the old generals. Now they have also obtained the guidance of senior Zhang Le, so there is no need to worry about the lack of people to manage. The team's tactics are known for their speed and freshness, without any incompatibility. The spirit and technology have gradually improved, and it is worthy of being a rising star</p>
<h3>Shantou Hometown Ambitious</h3>
<p>Renyu's main general Ma Canxi and forward shooting star Lin Weicong have been recruited by Lin Zuoshi this year and belong to the Shantou team. According to the Shantou team's performance, it is in a state of extreme progress. Now that Ma Lin has joined, the fierce tiger has wings, and it should not be taken lightly. It is predicted that when the team competes in the future, the Shantou folks will definitely cheer loudly. According to its performance, it can compete with the strong teams for a day's length, and it is also a promising team.</p>
<h3>Movie Stars Are Normal</h3>
<p>Appearing on the court in the posture of a movie star has a greater appeal, but tracing back to the team's ball skills, because of Qian Xucang's patient guidance, Li Dashen and Wu Wenchao's supervision from the side, and the team leader Shu Shi's spiritual example. Therefore, the film has already made people in the basketball world look at each other. Recently, they won the Phoenix Cup championship, which shows their recent situation. Check that the team members are full of vigor, and there should be better harvests.</p>
<h3>Renyu Team is Hosted by Yu and Li</h3>
<p>The last time in the Zhongqing League, it caused a sensation for a while, and they were hoping to achieve something. Unfortunately, Lin Weicong and Ma Canxi's departure reduced their strength sharply, and they are not what they used to be. The remaining two generals, Yu Huanzi and Li Zhaohe, host the Central Plains, and those who assist them are young generals who have just emerged and need to be tempered. However, it is also a great thing to extract new people from this.</p>
<h3>Star Perfume Leadership</h3>
<p>The Star team organized by Zhou Wenji, the director of the Star Perfume Factory, has many strong players under his command, such as Shen Dafan, Xi Rong, and Wang Jinghu, who have long been famous. This time, Tao Shaosheng and He Xiaoguang also joined, and their strength is very average. The author believes that although the team does not have the ambition to win the Central Plains in the league, based on its experience, it will definitely pose a threat to the strong teams and may create upsets. Team leader Zhou Zhonggang has always had research on basketball, so he has created a lot.</p>
<h3>V Team New Army Zibin Training</h3>
<p>The V team is a new army trained by Wu Zibin, and the list is full of unknown people. In the past, they were in the top state of Group B. When these young heroes are seeking to improve, being able to have this opportunity to learn from each other is the true meaning of liquidating the later generations. After this league, the V team's young generals will definitely be successful, and they will not be worthy of Wu Zibin's hard work.</p>
<h3>Tongren Xuanjia Shooter is Ill</h3>
<p>The Xuanjia Class Tongren team must be the most loved by fans in every game, because they show their ball skills to the fullest during the battle, without any bad habits, and their ball skills are also above the standard. They defeated the Oriental and Monocle teams in the Xiqing League, adding to the good stories in the basketball world. This time, because the shooter Xuan Jun is in poor health and cannot exercise according to the doctor, the general hub of the points obtained will only be entrusted to Xuan Tong's hands alone, which will be relatively reduced. In summary, the ten powerful teams in Group A have their own merits. Furthermore, to evaluate it, Zhongbei, Hualian, Dahua, and Shantou teams should be called the Four Heavenly Kings, and the championship hope is also based on these four teams as seeds. However, the spirit and morality of each team are all excellent, and they will create the most complete page in basketball history for the Shen Bao Cup.</p>
<h3>McGinity's Punishment: Suspended from Competition for Four Matches, Pan, Chief Officer of the Three Provinces Overseas Chinese Association, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>— Jie Mei</p>
<p>Recently, due to the issue of the Three Provinces Football Team's players' departure and the Overseas Chinese Association team's abrupt withdrawal during the first charity match, there has been much discussion in various circles, and newspapers have also reported on this matter extensively. Mr. Pan, the chief officer of the two teams from the Three Provinces, explained the matter in detail to the author. A record of his statement is as follows: [The other day, I discussed the issue of the players' affiliation and expressed my feelings about the sudden request for withdrawal by a small number of players from the Three Provinces team, which I organized. As soon as this statement was made, it provoked an immediate reaction. The players concerned appealed to various circles through newspapers, which I found astonishing after reading. The reason is that since these players have firmly requested to change their affiliation to other teams, I could not force them to stay. The Football Association has its own appropriate handling of the matter, so how can one allow those who speak irresponsibly to constantly criticize? Regarding the players' claim that they had to leave due to professional reasons, it is truly perplexing. Football and profession are two different things, and the principle is very clear. If one plays football solely for professional reasons, it will foster bad habits and even lead to misunderstandings with the players' amateur status, which I do not approve of. However, I will never hinder them in this matter, nor is there any need to hinder them. They can leave if they want to, so what more can be said? However, I feel regret that pure and flawless players are suddenly tempted by greed. Now that the Football Association gentlemen are handling this matter impartially, I sincerely hope that the general players will not make any more unnecessary appeals, which will only create another rift in the sports community. Also, during the first charity match the other day, the Overseas Chinese Association team withdrew halfway through, which has been widely criticized. In fact, while it is true that Captain McGinity's leading the team off the field was a lack of sportsmanship, McGinity is an Italian representative to the World Games, with advanced experience and skills. His quiet departure may have been due to his indignation. Whether the referee's judgment was flawed is a matter of opinion and difficult to conclude. I did not express any opinion when the team left the field the second time, so I did not try to stop them again. The reason was that McGinity and the others were at the height of their anger at that time, and trying to persuade them to stay might not have been effective. If that were the case, how would I have handled myself? The Football Association has now punished McGinity by suspending him from competition for four matches as a warning to others.]</p>
