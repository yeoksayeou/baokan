<p>社評</p>
<h3>轉變的時代</h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭是東亞一百年來第一件大事，從大東亞戰爭起，東亞民族進入一個最偉大的轉變時代。這個時代決定東亞民族將來的命運，東亞民族以後能否不再遭受侵略，東亞民族以後能否獨立自由，端視東亞民族在這個時代所努力的成績。</p>
<p>在這個大時代裏的人們，大都感覺許多煩悶。煩悶的原因，己故蔣百里先生說得最透澈，他說：，「久們的舊習慣每不能够適應世界的新環境，世界的新環境又不尤許人們的舊習慣」。從這些煩悶裏產生出兩種截然不同的思想和生活，一是被動的，消極的；一是主動的，積極的。前一種人為環境所支配，後一種人支配環境。為環境所支配的人們漸漸結束他們的舊生命，支配環境的人們漸漸創造他們的新生命。</p>
<p>這是一個空前的劇變，處在這個時代的中國人，無論士農工商，都負着一個最最重大的責任。我們要知道，這個變動是中國獨立上所必須經過的，是中國獨立上所不可避免的，我們要認淸目標，兩步併作一步，努力前進，方才可以保存這個民族。</p>
<p>中國是一個農業社會，一般人民的生活和他們所做的工作，自古以來，百年如一日地遵循於舊習慣，服從於舊傳統。自從鴉片戰爭，門戶開放之後，舊習慣舊傳統已經不能够適應新環境了，因此整千整萬的國民，在不知不覺之中受環境的淘汰，做了可憐的犧牲者，整個國家的命運，也就受了英美的支配。我們回顧中國近百年的歷史，和許多志士們努力奮鬥的史實，不能不引起我們感懷。感懷是無用的，我們要改革我們的舊習慣，去適應目前的新環境。我們要鍛鍊我們的新精神，創造我們的新生命。</p>
<p>改革舊習慣固然是一件難難事，好比記賬，記了一生「上收下付」的流水賬的人，怎樣能够立刻就做新式簿記。可是到了流水賬不能適應新環境的時候，你非得做新式簿記就不能够生存。這時候，在你前而只有二條路：一條是被淘汰，一條是趕快學習而創造新生命。個人的前途如此，國家的前途亦如此，而盟邦日本的明治維新更是創造新生命的最好例子。被動的淘汰使國家民族衰亡，中動的革新使國家民族復興。時間是最迅速的，歷史是最殘酷的，大東亞戰爭已經兩年多了，我們做了些什麼？我們改革了多少？我們希望大家要時常相　，我們希望大家要做復興中華的志士　深衛大東亞的英雄！</p>

<p>日東條首相</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電日代表東條首相，對滿洲國廣播辭如次：「今日欣逢滿洲國建國節，余借此機會，遙向親愛之滿洲國民致祝辭，至感欣幸。對於滿洲國皇帝陛下之政躬康寗，衷心尤深頌祝。回顧滿洲國建國以來，於茲已歷十二載，其間滿洲國內之治安確立，民族協和，順大安民之大業，節節實現。產業亦日見向榮，誠為東亞所慶賀。大東亞戰爭勃發以來；滿洲國與日本步調一致，積極整頓高度國防，國家體制，於國內則增產食糧，吏促進工業生產計劃。對外則與中華民國及大東亞各國，歐洲盟邦，益加密切提挑，其貫獻於大東亞戰爭之力量，實極深厚，而為日本國民感級不止。尤以最近於食糧方面之對日協力滋大，　藉此機會表示感謝。蓋阻止貧婪無壓之英美，再侵略東亞企圖。建設　合於道義之大東亞，僅有完成大東亞戰爭之最終勝利，始可達到其目的。日本獲得滿洲國即共抱解放大東亞理想之各國家各民族裏心之協力，深信必能獲得此次大戰之最終勝利。茲當滿洲國建國佳節，益加密切　　，並祈滿洲過之國運益臻隆昌」，</p>
<p>張國務總理</p>
<p>新京一日中央社電　滿國張國務總理廣播詞如下：「滿洲運國十二年，從一個國家的歷史來說，的確是又新又淺，可是在此短期迅速的發展和國力的充實，足可以冠居世界。尤其是從大東亞戰爭勃發以來，以已往十年所培養的國力來實獻日本，完遂聖戰。現在全國四千三曰萬國民已結成一團，邁進于戰力增强，和北邊鎭護的二大使命。滿洲建國是大東亞建設的發端，去年十一月大東亞會議所宣布的大東亞共同宣言中，可設是把我國建國的理想，整個的普遍於大東亞全城。大東亞建設的大業，固然不是一件容易的事情，但是大實亞十億民族以鐵石的决意，團結努力，去擊滅英美，相信一定可以成功。中日滿為大東亞的軸心，這三國的堅固盟約，無疑的使是這偉大的推進。現在日本舉國必勝的體制已成。中華民股由汪主席領導，國力也愈現充實，殊令人心强力壯。見在敵人决心想短期決戰，恃其物資力，在各方反攻，戰局愈行深刻，已到絕頂大東亞隆替的重大時期了。也正是大東亞個國家各名族，由各個的立場，發揮最大實力的時期。當此建國十二年的佳節，我滿洲國願與東亞各國，益加緊密提攜。勇猛奮鬥，以必勝必成的　念，擊滅英美，堅持到底。</p>

<h3>泥濘季節將臨　德調整陣綫　東綫南北路戰事劇烈</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　軍事方面昨接德國新聞社發表：東綫泥濘季節即將提早降臨，南路之冰凍地面巳開始融解，但在中路及北路溫度仍在冰點下十二度至十五度，氣象學家亦預期雨季及泥濘季節之早臨。德軍事專家意見，此種氣候之關係，當德軍調整陣綫時，亦予以相當之顧慮。考察東綫全部局勢，柏林方面亦以為蘇軍未節達到其預期之目的，旣不能突破德軍防綫，又不能阻擾德軍作戰略上栘動。德軍自然為望於泥濘季節之前，佔領有利之陣地，使泥濘之地面不能阻得其移動之進行。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期一東綫南北兩路均有激戰泥濘姐姐因新寒浪之突襲，遂吿中國，有數處地區溫度竟降至零點二十度，實為此次冬季第一次之最低溫度。蘇軍利用天氣之關係，使用溜冰師團及機械化之雪撬，企圖擾亂德軍之移動。庇柏斯湖之東記浦斯柯夫方面。蘇軍竭力以求越過湖沼地帶，以免天氣之轉變，致停滯其作戰行動，但被德軍之後衛所阻。尼維爾西北，蘇軍使用多數坦克車及數個來福槍師團，以炮隊及飛機之掩護，發動大規模之進攻，其目的顯圖自南面包圍北部之德軍，但德軍洞燭其奸，於其初步之進攻，即予以重創擊退，主陣綫仍在德軍手中。</p>
<p>南路戰況</p>
<p>南路泳雪已開始融解，聶伯河套大雨如注，星期一此區之德軍之防禦系統仍屹立不動。蘇軍之主要攻勢，仍以克里伏洛格為中心，普利貝特顯地之南德機械部隊正與蘇騎兵隊及坦克隊展開拉鋸戰。克里米亞區於長時間之沉寂後，蘇軍復自寇許東北發動攻勢，蘇軍散佈煙幕及以張大砲隊之支援，企圖於德軍之陣線上做成裂口，但在德軍陣地前即被驅散，只在一點突入德軍陣綫，亦卒被肅情。</p>

<h3>德應用電波原理發明防空新利器</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　反軸心空軍最近以一千架乃至二千架之大編隊，轟炸德國各地，但經德空軍之猛烈反擊，其損失約為一百架至二百架。衆認德空軍之戰果，實為德戰鬥機優秀之表現。同時並認德軍在最近空戰中，係使用應用電波之新兵器，該新兵器能辨別是否敵機來襲，使戰鬥機得以縱橫活躍。德週刋雜誌曾就該新兵器之原理加以論述，謂新兵器之原理為向空中發放電波，若飛機接觸此稱電波時，迭發生反應而便測量，同時應用種種方法，在深夜亦可判別是否敵機。最近德拔師曾利用某種方法，粉碎反軸心投入錫管藉以防害此種機器性能之企圖，故反軸心軍每當轟炸德國之際，雖投下多量之錫管，但未能妨害此有高性能感覺之器械。</p>

<h3>積極發展中的　滿洲過國農工業</h3>
<p>最大的豐收</p>
<p>負有完成日滿食糧自給自足使命的滿洲農業，其實要性正逐日增大。滿洲國的農民共有三千四·五百萬，實佔總人口四千三百萬的約八〇％。而且低物價政策的基礎築於農產物上，由於這些醇朴的農民默默工作，國內生活才得安定。他們並完成向日本內地，華北，朝鮮輸出食糧，油料的竄責。據吉林省的農民稱，民國三十二年的收成實屬數十年來罕見的變收，所以上年度四强行收貨所受的打擊亦得恢復一部分，目下芷値出貨最盛期，滿載穀類的大車排成長蛇陣，興農部當局也認為本年　分配量的出貨，確實不生問題云。</p>
<p>對於農產物的出貨，棉製品的特別配給也於民國三十二年實行，因出貨意外早，棉製品連準備也來不及，全滿交易塲非常活躍。又，鑑於本年（民國三十二年）的大豐收，來年度地力的減耗當然也須預期，所以農　遵當局的熟心指導，努力　肥，以期恢復地力，進行着明年度增產必成能勢的準備。</p>
<p>至於向滿洲推行水稻栽培，也甚可觀，有一，二個開拓圍已收穫每段（日本面積名，合九九一·七平方公尺）糙米九石的驚人收割量，有些實騐農家則一町（日本面積名，等於十段）可收穫九噸（日本內地平均為四噸）。</p>
<p>而且，現在尚有二千萬叮的未耕地。且除南滿的一部分地方外，夙行粗放農法，平均收穫量皆不甚高，由於開墾及改良技術，今後尚可期待大量增產，因而日滿食糧自給政策將可强力推進。農業方面的誤題，除右述開墾及技術改良之外，尚有農產物價格與消費物資價格的鈌狀差及收官佣金問題，北滿大農的細分化傾向，肥料暨農具供給問題等。</p>
<p>移植的近況</p>
<p>關於滿洲開拓政策所有國家的實大使命，固巳無須多言，但大量日僑定居滿洲農村，實為確立國防國家體制所不可缺少的，這種儼然的事實應充分認識，當此緊急事態，開拓政策應更進一步的理由，大半在此，開拓團，義勇隊的人殖地也應老慮國防所需而加以配置。又在增產方面，本年（民國三十一年）關拓團已達到七成增產，現更發動明年度的增產加倍運動。特別於從來在日本內地各都市消費生活的轉業者的歸農，由日本消費者變為滿洲生產者的轉向，正在廣大範圍內進行。其力雖微，但亦不失為增强生產的一翼，頗可注目。</p>
<p>開拓的現勢，在去年（民國三十一年）末，開拓團入殖者五百七十三團，人口十四萬六千人；靑年義勇隊渡滿總數六萬五千人（內義勇隊向開拓團移行完了者二萬六千人）；勤勞奉仕隊渡滿者三萬八千人。去年度開拓民耕種面積約十七萬五千町，本年度二十三萬九千町，來年度預料可突破三十萬町。明年度開拓政策的重點第一在各未完成開拓團補充入殖。（以上節譯去年十二月份朝日新聞）</p>
<p>鋼鐵積極增產</p>
<p>滿洲國政府鑒於戰局的緊張，鋼鐵為戰力的中心今故其增產為當前急務。於是經電力事業的統合之後，合併國內三大製鐵事業。合併要綱十七日通過參議府會議，十八日發表其內容，據此，昭和製鋼所（資本金四億圓），本溪湖煤鐵公司（二億圓），東邊道開發公司（一億二千萬圓）三大製鐵公司合併，新設滿洲製鐵股份有限公司（資本金七億四千萬圖，特殊法人），新公司設總社於鞍山，一切合同及手續均已吿竣，預定於四月一日開始業務。合併製鐵公司的趣旨，乃在適應鋼鐵增產之緊急要求，綜合的，有機的，並高度的利用三公司現在所有的技術，原料，資源，資材，器城等，以謀增加生產力。滿洲國的製鐵事業之理想體制，至此己吿確立。昭和，本溪湖，東邊逍三製鐵公司為滿洲熏工業範圍內之姊妹公司，向有密切聯繫，第一次五年計劃以來，已積極向開發鋼鐵邁進，大東訊戰爭勃發後。原料技術建設計劃等各部門，應更趨密切，故製鐵事榮的合併，實為完成增產的急務。</p>
<p>合併要綱：　應合併的企業體為昭和製鋼所股份有限公司，本溪湖煤鐵股份有限公司，東邊道開發股份有限公司三家。</p>
<p>關於合併者（甲）昭和，本溪湖，及東邊道開發三公司合併設立新法人。（乙）對合併公司的股東，交付等價的新法人股票。</p>
<p>新法人為滿洲國特殊法人，資本金七億四千萬圓。</p>
<p>新法人的總公司設於鞍山市（原昭和製鋼所所在地）。</p>
<p>關於滿洲所担任生產的特殊品質的鋼鐵，誤確保其品質及數量。</p>
<p>新法人承繼昭和。本溪湖，東邊道開發三公司的全部從業員。（譯自二月十九日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>昨十二次　滿洲國建國節　滿總領招待新聞界發表談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊　昨（一）日為滿洲帝國第十二次建國節，滿洲國大使館駐滬總頜事葉　公，特於昨日午後三時假華　飯店九　，茶會招待本市中日新聞界，由　總領事發表建　十二週年之現伏及其感想後，旋由本報陳社長致　，至五時餘始行背會。茲誌葉總領事談話如次：</p>
<p>葉總領事談話</p>
<p>本日（一日）是我滿洲帝國第十二次的建國節，鄙人以滿洲帝國駐上海總領事的資格，說幾句感想的話。</p>
<p>我滿洲國在大同元年，就是民國二十一年的今大建設成立的，到今天不過經過了十二年，可是現在仕內治安方面，完全安定，政治經濟文化各方面，也全有躍進的發展，在外以日本為始，與善隣盟邦各國互相提携，邦交愈加親密鞏固，同時並以全副的精神，對於亘古未有的大軍亞戰爭的完成，盡力協助。</p>
<p>以下鄙人簡單的把在大東亞戰爭下奮鬥的滿洲國的狀態，介紹給立在同樣理想和命運之下的新生中國作予參考。</p>
<p>建國以前的滿洲，是在軍閥秕政，和匪賊跳梁的政治下，國政紊亂，治安破壞，民衆的窮困達於極點，因之成為歐美諸國侵略和榨取的對象，為全東亞設想，那時是正在很可憂　的狀熊之中。</p>
<p>建國之後</p>
<p>然而自從滿洲建國之後，在日本絕對的支持援助之下，打着王道樂土民族協和的大理想的旗幟邁進的結果，未經數年，治安確立，庶政一新，文化振興，形成了很有生氣的很有秩序的狀態，把昔日的面目完全更新了。設起來我滿洲國就是今天日本所唱道的東亞新秩序運動的先驅者，現在正是東亞民族相親相扶的，行的時候，更現實的表示我國能够產生出怎樣大的力量，鄙人相信對於中國以及共榮圈的各國。可以暗示出將來的應進的方向。</p>
<p>一方面以東亞為中心努力，因為有貧婪無盡的一英美的煽動，日見惡化，竟造成中日事製的勃發，竟至於演出兄弟關於牆的悲劇來，一方面英美的道種的欲　，在歐洲大陸惹　起第二次的區洲大戰，因之還有民國三十年的大東亞戰爭的勃發，在亘古未有廣大地城和規校上，反覆的淡出苛烈的激戰．滿洲國應付這種狀况的變化，也奮然舉起全國的力量，為保全很有光輝的東亞天地而參加爭鬥。大東亞戰爭在南方迭次樹立赫赫戰果，關東軍的情銳，靜靜的在嚴寒的朔北努力的訓練，可是為打算協力這個戰爭，近年來顯然充實完備的滿洲國軍新銳的力量，亦不可以忽略，日蘇兩國中間不用說，日蘇中立條約是嚴正的存在着，在變轉無常現下的國際環境的裏面，准有北方是　持着靜謐的狀態。</p>
<p>五年計劃</p>
<p>因為早就預想到有今日，所以在　德四年，就是民；二十六年，就樹立了滿洲國產業五年計劃，雖然泡遇着中日事變的勃潑，歐洲大戰的展開等種種的困難，可是由於日滿，官全力團結努力完成的結果，不但收獲了很有光輝的成績，繼續又成立第二次五年計劃，企圖飛躍的增加鐵。煤。銘農產物等戰爭遂行上不可缺少的物資產量。</p>
<p>五年計劃所包含盛大　工部門內，開發是需要很大的固定生產設備的，在道關係上，這種生產物的成果，雖然急切不能期待，可是滿洲國的鐵工部門，把道種基礎的段階，巳經作成，現在已經進入生產的時期了，然而把這個膨大的設備，在經營面去澈底的而且無遺憾的利用，以使增大戰爭資源的生產的體勢，完成那是不用說的了，對於緊急物資現在正在進行生　　備的，更加擴張，這種設備要是全面的發動時候，一定能產出可驚數量的鐵，煤。等。</p>
<p>其次對於農產物方面說起來，我滿洲國是向來以農業國知名的，又是在容易演成食糧資源不足的戰時下，本着自任為大東亞兵站基地的覺悟和責任，努力於農地　大和士地利用價値强化的結果，這方面也有很可依賴的成績，去年度達於數百萬噸的農產。在一月上旬，已　交出完了，在這以外有所謂「報恩交糧」，繼績的還把農產物交納出來。</p>
<p>這麼一來，昔日的民族鬥爭，邊境未開的土地，一變而為民族協和，產業極其殷振的新與國家，完全作到大東亞的兵器廠，和兵站基地的地步。</p>
<p>國民訓練</p>
<p>更進一步不但是物資的方面，就是精神方面，因為施行與新興國家相符的國民訓練的結果，得到很可觀的成績，上而所說物資的躍進的極大理由，是由於國民訓練的澈底，也不算是過分的話</p>
<p>第一在建國同時就組織起來和政府立於兩位一體立塲的協和會，賦　所謂宣德達情的機能，同時提倡靑年遝動的組織施行，對於第二代國民心身的訓練，其次雖在戰時下，也使用多額的國費，來努力振興敎育方面的事業。</p>
<p>更在康德七年，就是民國二十九年施行國兵法，公布徵兵制　，以軍事訓練和國民訓練為最大目標而去敎練　其結果得到已極其優良的成績。　　最近可以特別說出的是勤勞奉公法的制定，這個的結果，從去年一月二日將勤勞奉公作為國民義務的制度化，因此在去年度動員了數十萬的靑年，使之從事間懇治水，道路建設，以及重要工業等方面的勞作，得到很大的效果，本制度所可以注意的，是國民精神的陶冶，國家的富强，國民福祉的增進，在物心兩方面，裨益國家國民的地方很多，道樣來，　洲國建國不過十年有餘，可是在國內所有的方面，完成着驚異的發於，對於時局可以說更有深刻的意義，為應付這種時局，滿洲國在建國第十年的二月八日，潑表了滿洲國基木國策大綱，反省滿洲國過去的實績，明一示在壯列時局之下的滿洲國　進之道，謂個主旨在徹底於國家的本義，與昻揚國家觀念，本於民族協和的精神，鞏固國民的國結，同時企圖文敎的振興，振起勤勞興國的　　，以期國力克實，民生安定，在如此大方針之下，滿洲國軍官民成為一體，盡其全力，集中於大東亞戰完成的一點。</p>
<p>解放聖戰</p>
<p>想起來大東亞戰爭是打算由貧婪無盡英　的魔　裏，解放大東亞的一大聖戰，實在是購着東亞十萬萬的興亡一大决戰，就是柬亞人民是不是願欲永遠的甘服於英美的榨取和壓迫之下，或者是能不能完成東亞民族自主的共存共榮的秩序，這就一要看這個决戰的勝敗如何了，在這個意思上，大東亞戰爭不僅為日本的戰爭，並且也不是為日本而發生的戰爭，換句話說，　在是為全東亞的戰爭，而且是為全東亞而發生的戲爭。</p>
<p>因為日軍忠議勇武的奮鬥，開戰後不出半年，就把英美醜膚已經驅逐殆盡，現在决戰雖然尚未終了，可是在大東亞內部已經有了明朗堅强新秩序的曙光，這個就是緬甸國的獨立，菲律賓共和國的成立，還有自由印度臨時政府的建設，全東亞正在活潑建設的空氣中活動着，去年的秋天，在東京開的大東亞會　，是東亞新秩序歷史上强有力的開始，在這個會議議决的大東亞宜（言是以東洋道德，日本精神為基礎，是英美遠不能企及的道義的大方針，他的先驅的制成者相信就是我　洲國。</p>
<p>然而仇敵英美依仗着他們强大的物資和生資力，拚命的來　續着　反攻，我們對此嚴肅的事實，無所恐懼，視若無睹，更應三思　個决戰的意義，奮然　起滅此朝食，東亞的民族結東起來的時候，還有甚麼可怕的呢，最後的勝利是屬於我們的、而日我們還得要必須得勝利一，大　亞各國的中心，不用設當然是日滿華三國，我想嚴肅的决　，我們日滿華三國，不論遭過如何的事熊，　要相扶相携决戰到底，以建設大少亞光　的歷史，鄙人的說話此終了。</p>
<p>本報社長感想</p>
<p>記得在民國二十年，我曾到過滿洲一次，半年之間，各重要的地方差不多都到過了！當時滿洲還是由張學良統治，是一個軍閥統治政治的典型，想不到相隔十二年之後的今日，在東北角上會產生出這麼一個光明燦爛的新興國來。</p>
<p>剛才聽到葉總領事的談話，我們知道滿洲國能有今日的新興建設，完全是在困難中奮鬥得來的！如果時局平靖相信一定比現在更優越！不過，也可以說正因為處於時局動湯之中，所以滿洲國朝野一致努力奮鬥，而方有今日的成績。</p>
<p>孔子設過：「三人行，必有吾師！」現在中。日。滿三國，正向大東亞共榮道上邁進，日滿兩國的　設精神，頗足　我們的　樣，我們又怎能自暴自棄不知追效呢？</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭爆發兩年以來，滿洲國已經盡了參戰國後方的使命與職責，有了過去十年來的努力建設，才能以實力實踐參戰的使命。那麼，我們也得自問，我們參戰以後，可曾實踐使命沒有？</p>
<p>我對於滿洲國今日的成就，有下列三點感想：</p>
<p>他們是「少說塵話，埋頭做事。」</p>
<p>他們的人民生活，表面上或許此我們困苦，而國家的總力却是增加了</p>
<p>他們的成功，不可否認的是因為得到日本的許多助力。但同時我們也不可否認是因滿洲國當局與人民的共同努力，綜合起來，才能有今日的成續</p>
<p>以上就是我今天一點臨時的感想，希望中滿兩國共回協力盟邦日本爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利。</p>
<p>配給制度完善　　大陸新　日高　輯局長提出詢　謂：個日本配給制度，各地一體嚴格施行，不識滿洲國配給制度如何？」當由滿洲滿領事館副領事松田氏加以說明，略謂：「現在滿洲國之配給制度分為三種：　勞工配給，　都市配給，　農村配給。</p>
<p>第一，因戰時增產時期，各種國策公司之勞　者，工作較常人為重，使命亦大，故配給數　較普通市民為多，每月一人，可得二十五至三十斤之食物，如工作勤奮，成績特優者，尚有臨時額外配給，蓋此舉寓有獎慟性質，故皆安心工作，而增產事業，愈見發達。</p>
<p>第二，都市配給制度，較為繁難，故嚴密老慮，因商業區大多集於一處，由住宅區往商店購物，非利用交通工具不可，往返頗費周折，故根據一區之人口，按其區界所處之物品數量，在一段區域內規定有幾家商店，附近店民祇須向之登記，按期可領各種配給物品，食物方面，二十五歲以上者，大約每月有十二公斤，幼　與年高者，按年齡予以　整，辦法良好，不若上海市民有排隊候領之擠軋相象。</p>
<p>第三，農村配給一年分為三節，即正月節，端午節，中秋節，此外在秋冬雨季農作登塲之時，如到臨時特種配經，通宵宮給食物為麵粉，其他菜蔬果實，在農村村皆有辦法，不需再配其　貧物。十</p>
<p>總之，滿洲國之配給制度，已很完善，在辦法上　，恐較日本尤勝一籌，故能担負此戰時使命。</p>
<p>其次，滿洲國向重農業，重工業次之，輕工業則賴日本產品，但大東亞戰爭以後，為適應時勢之需要，一方加堅於重工　生產，同時振興輕工　二年以　成績劃卓著，器如藥，味之素，文具等各項輕工業，不但無須賴日本之進口，且有大量可輸往華北等地。</p>
<h3>三期戶口煤球　明日起普售　每人十五斤八元四角</h3>

<h3>澈底抑平物　價須標本兼施　取締囤積為第一步驟</h3>
<p>晚近物價漲風殊烈，記者昨走訪上海特別市商會，旣各主要商品同業聯合會，詢以對於抑平物偎政策意見，及最近物價急遽高翔因素，據吿稱本市因受海外交通中斷影響，物炎來源倍極困難，因此一般商人即乘機，動，異貨居奇，囤積，操縱第情事，終至接踵發生。</p>
<p>本會等有鑒及斯，早經通吿剴動各業商人，　守標準物價，免受法律制裁。倘因成本關係，確有變更最高標準之必要時，應事先由各該業公會申述理由，備具成本計算表呈由主管當局核定後，方准變更，否則視為私抬物價，顧目前之第一步驟，乃在從嚴取締非法囤積，務使全部物資流通市上，次在疏通來源，始可謂標本兼施也云云。</p>
<h3>本市各行莊　恢復往來透支</h3>
<p>中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處穩定金融協助政府抑平物價起見，會於去年限令各銀行錢莊於　結束期內，收回信用貸款，經各行莊厲行辦理催歸欠款後，所有以前貸放信用賬款，大部均巳結束。今年各行莊對巳結消客戶，亦巳恢復往來透支，近日市面銀根似顧着鬆動。據探悉目前所辦透支賬戶，幾全為生產工業工廠者，其放款對象為絲毛織新藥化學原料及製品造紙烟草等業云。</p>

<h3>敎員的免役問題</h3>
<p>— 倪瑋球</p>
<p>關於准許自警團免役的辦法，以產第一區和第八區不甚相同，即一區內敎員多數不准免役，而八區內敎員則一律免役。去歲十一月中，保甲當局曾公佈免役條例，敎員亦在免役之列；各聯保處亦曾分別佈吿通知敎員向保甲股申請免役。可是最近前八區內敎員，亦不准免役了。</p>
<p>筆者係敎員之一，深知敎員站崗之困難，願誠懇地簡述其苦衷如次：</p>
<p>工作方面：敎員與一般商人工人不同：所仟工作是傳授知識與最須寶貴光陰的靑年及兒童；而實如被派站崗的時間在白晝，則使數十百學得不到空坐數小時，其損失决非金錢所可補償；如在夜間，則課卷無睱批閱，積壓太多，影響敎程極大。</p>
<p>身體方面：敎師體質多數文弱，且眼光折視的也不少，對於警衛上　亦不能有多少帮助。如派在夜間站崗則精力痰憊，必奴妨礙健康，遲睡少睡，都將影嚮明日的精神。</p>
<p>經濟方面：敎師薪給菲薄，被派站崗以後，如請假則學校按照鐘點扣薪，如請人代替，則須出代崗實，如被查出，父須罰款，如不去站，亦不　人代，則處罰尤重、以敎師　　之收入，何能再相負此項額外的支出？</p>
<p>基此三點苦衷，敎師實有免除為自警團服役之必要。傳聞敎員至今未獲免役之原因，是在於假冒敎員申請免役的為數不少之故那未我們　望上海特別市敎育會仿照郵政局辦法，將已加入會員及雖未加入而確實祖任敎員的名單，開列送呈保甲當局請求核准免役，則一切假冒以及賄賂等無弊，都可以避免了。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雄著　洪牟譯</p>
<p>兵學校論（三）</p>
<p>有道種精神組織制度，纔有那樣黃金的傳統，道是　都可以想像間的，但是、　基礎，是何時何人　的，筆者不　，溯諸以往，渺若五里霧中。</p>
<p>尋諸本校的沿革，明治二年，在東京築地創立的海軍操練所為其潑詳，後改　海軍兵學寮，海軍兵學校，明治十一年，移轉到江田島的首任的校長是川村純義，但這傳統的基礎，也未必然是他做成的。要設是移轉到江田島後的首任校長有地品之丞，也好像不對的在移當時全員都搭輪船東京九，前來江戶島，直到校舍建築落成後，俱在船內施行敎育的。我們可以想像到那開拓新世界的意氣一定是很熾烈的，在當時已經保有現在一般的傳統。　如分隊制度，在兵學寮時代巳經存在着。自治精神的面貌，已經可以見得出來。倒樌子總短艇的節目，起源也相當古似的，要是詢問現役的大將。中將，也只有回答在自己的時代也有的，但是不知道是何時何人所發明的。　然有這樣古舊的傳統，兵學校有七十年的歷史，但是他們並不固守舊習的。譬如前章曾寫過的「五省」是現在少佐級的人們，都不知道的課程。在作業簿中，記入週末的感想，也是最近開始的。在長的期間裏，有種種的改廢和添削。然而根本是不變動的。好比大河集諸細流，而愈增其大似的。</p>
<p>要而言之，兵學校的優統雖統雖。而其精神永久是新的。從首任校長到現在的校長，並沒有特別可注意的，或斷行大改革的。以有順總時勢隨時革新，好像長命燈添上新油似的。在這次我們可以理解那傳統的神秘性，回正當的維持方法。並沒有强求傳統所由來的必要。起源恐怕是發於海軍操練所以前的。然而成為兵付校以後，傳統的保特者同繼承者的主體，無論在過去或現在，都是學生自己，這是必須要特書的。再初期的兵學校，是取法於英國，取　格羅斯以下多數英人敎師，而學習軍事，是的確的事實，但那完全都是滬傭的關係。常時的海軍當局，確有意外高明的見識。說起來好比歌謠成圍棋的先生似的。雖然也稱作「先生」但功課完畢，便毫無關係。學習的「學術」而不是精神。敎授「學術」也不過是極短的期間，以後便以語學敎師的資格，留任在兵學校。並比最後一人的語學敎師，在兩年前也從江田島失去了他的容姿。</p>

        <h1>1944.03.02</h1>
<h3>A Changing Era</h3>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is the most significant event in East Asia in the last hundred years. From the Greater East Asia War onwards, the East Asian nations have entered a most momentous era of transformation. This era will determine the future destiny of the East Asian peoples. Whether East Asian nations will no longer suffer aggression and whether they will be independent and free depends on the achievements of their efforts in this era.</p>
<p>People in this great era mostly feel much anxiety. The reason for this anxiety was most thoroughly explained by the late Mr. Chiang Pai-li, who said: "Old habits can no longer adapt to the world's new environment, and the world's new environment does not particularly allow people's old habits." From these anxieties arise two distinctly different thoughts and lives: one is passive and negative; the other is active and positive. The former are dominated by the environment, while the latter dominate the environment. Those dominated by the environment gradually end their old lives, while those who dominate the environment gradually create their new lives.</p>
<p>This is an unprecedented upheaval. Chinese people in this era, whether scholars, farmers, artisans, or merchants, bear a most significant responsibility. We must understand that this change is a necessary and unavoidable process for China's independence. We must identify our goals, take two steps at a time, and strive forward in order to preserve this nation.</p>
<p>China is an agricultural society, and the lives and work of its people have followed old habits and traditions for centuries, seemingly unchanged. Since the Opium War and the opening of the doors, old habits and traditions have no longer been able to adapt to the new environment. As a result, thousands upon thousands of citizens have unknowingly been eliminated by the environment, becoming pitiful victims, and the fate of the entire nation has been controlled by Britain and America. As we look back at China's history over the past century and the efforts and struggles of many patriots, we cannot help but feel emotional. But emotions are useless. We must reform our old habits to adapt to the current new environment. We must forge our new spirit and create our new lives.</p>
<p>Reforming old habits is indeed a difficult task, like bookkeeping. How can someone who has kept a simple cash book of "receipts above and payments below" all their life immediately do modern accounting? But when the simple cash book can no longer adapt to the new environment, you must do modern accounting in order to survive. At this time, there are only two paths before you: one is to be eliminated, and the other is to quickly learn and create a new life. The future of individuals is like this, and so is the future of the nation. The Meiji Restoration in our allied nation, Japan, is the best example of creating a new life. Passive elimination leads to the decline and fall of a country and a nation, while active innovation leads to the revival of a country and a nation. Time is the fastest, and history is the cruelest. The Greater East Asia War has been going on for more than two years. What have we done? How much have we reformed? We hope everyone will always encourage each other, and we hope everyone will become patriots to revive China and heroes to defend Greater East Asia!</p>
<h3>Manchuria's Founding Anniversary Celebrated Grandly Yesterday; Officials from China, Japan, and Manchuria Exchanged Greetings on the Radio</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government and public celebrate March 1st as a day of festivity for the friendly nation of Manchuria. In order to express their shared congratulations, commemorative ceremonies were held in various locations. The Manchurian Embassy in Japan held a ceremony at the Kantoku Hall in Kuno-uchi at 10:00 AM to commemorate the 12th anniversary of its founding. Ambassador Wang, Counselor Yamari, and embassy staff members participated in the dignified ceremony. At noon, a commemorative lecture on the founding of Manchuria was held at Hibiya Public Hall. Participants including the Director-General of the East Asia General Headquarters, the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis Ota, the President of the Japan-Manchuria Central Association Miyata, the Ambassador of Manchuria Wang, and Minister of Agriculture Huang, who is visiting Japan as a special envoy of Manchuria and Asia, all gave speeches expressing their beliefs. At 5:30 PM, the Japan-Manchuria Central Association held a congratulatory dinner at the Imperial Hotel, attended by Asian delegates, Ambassador Wang, Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, Minister of Education Okabe, former Minister of Finance Kaya, and Generals Honjo, Matsui, and Hishikari, as well as over two hundred prominent figures from political and business circles. At 7:00 PM, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan and Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria exchanged greetings on the radio, and at 8:00 PM, there was an exchange broadcast between industrial warriors from Japan and Manchuria.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Today is the anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. All 43 million citizens of Manchuria celebrated enthusiastically. At 10:00 AM, the Manchurian Emperor personally presided over the founding shrine, while members of the Concordia Association led people in Xinjing and other provinces, cities, and counties in celebratory parades. Government offices, companies, and schools all held commemorative ceremonies, and shrines and memorial towers throughout the region held rituals praying for victory in the war. In the afternoon, a broadcast rally was held by the Concordia Youth League to strengthen war effort, with the Concordia Association as the central venue and the 17 broadcasting associations in the region as local venues. Beginning at 7:30 PM in the evening, there was also an exchange broadcast among China, Japan, and Manchuria.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Chu</p>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - March 1st marks the 12th anniversary of the founding of the Manchurian Empire. Starting at 7:30 PM, China, Japan, and Manchuria held a special exchange broadcast. Our country was represented by Foreign Minister Chu, who extended deep congratulations on the 12th anniversary of the founding of Manchuria. The original text is as follows: "Today, as we joyfully celebrate the 12th anniversary of the founding of our neighboring country, the Manchurian Empire, I, on behalf of the National Government of the Republic of China, extend my deepest congratulations and sincere hopes. The territory of Manchuria, with its Baekdu Mountains and Songhua River, is fertile for thousands of miles. The national railways reach everywhere, and transportation is extremely convenient. The abundance of resources and the diligence of the people are the unique glories of Manchuria, and the production of soybeans is famous throughout the world. Since its founding, Manchuria has been united from top to bottom, managing diligently. The development of resources and the efforts of construction are a source of pride for the nation. With careful governance, it has quickly shone brightly, becoming a powerful link in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is most admirable. As time passes, it has been twelve years. When we enter Xinjing, we see its majestic architecture, bustling people, and flourishing industries, creating a land of happiness. Its rapid progress is astonishing. The consecutive years of abundant agricultural harvests have earned praise from our ally, Japan. Today, in the year of the decisive battle for Greater East Asia, we must shoulder our mission, unleash our great national strength, sweep away the evil forces of Britain and America, and defeat the communists. This is my greatest wish in addition to the celebration. From now on, every year on this day, we will continue to express our endless congratulations, while reflecting on ourselves. I wish the Manchurian Empire prosperous and enduring."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo of Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Representative Prime Minister Tojo's radio address to Manchuria was as follows: "Today, on the joyous occasion of the founding anniversary of Manchuria, I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to the beloved people of Manchuria from afar. I am deeply grateful and offer my sincerest wishes for the health and well-being of His Majesty the Emperor of Manchuria. Looking back since the founding of Manchuria, twelve years have passed, during which the establishment of domestic security, ethnic harmony, and the great cause of peace and security for the people have been steadily realized. Industry has also flourished day by day, which is truly celebrated by East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchuria has been in step with Japan, actively reorganizing its highly defensive national structure. Domestically, it has increased food production and further promoted industrial production plans. Externally, it has strengthened its close ties with the Republic of China, other countries in Greater East Asia, and European allies, and its contribution to the Greater East Asia War has been extremely profound, for which the Japanese people are deeply grateful. In particular, its recent cooperation with Japan in food supplies is greatly appreciated, and I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. To prevent the greedy and oppressive Anglo-Americans from attempting to invade East Asia again and to build a Greater East Asia that conforms to morality, the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is the only way to achieve this goal. Japan, together with Manchuria and all the countries and ethnic groups that share the ideal of liberating Greater East Asia, firmly believes that it will be able to achieve the final victory in this great war. On this auspicious occasion of the founding of Manchuria, we must strengthen our close ties and pray for the prosperity of Manchuria."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Zhang of Manchuria</p>
<p>Xinjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Manchurian Prime Minister Zhang's radio address was as follows: "Twelve years since the founding of Manchuria is indeed a short period in the history of a nation, but its rapid development and the strengthening of its national power are sufficient to rank it among the world's best. Especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the national power cultivated over the past decade has been used to support Japan and achieve the sacred war. Now, the entire nation of 43 million people has united to advance the two major missions of strengthening war efforts and securing the northern border. The founding of Manchuria was the beginning of the construction of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration announced at the Greater East Asia Conference last November can be said to have applied the ideals of our nation's founding to the entire city of Greater East Asia. The great task of constructing Greater East Asia is certainly not an easy one, but the ten billion people of Greater East Asia, with their iron will, unite and strive to defeat the Anglo-Americans, and I believe we can succeed. China, Japan, and Manchuria are the axis of Greater East Asia, and the firm alliance of these three countries undoubtedly serves as a great driver. Now, Japan has established a system for ensuring victory for the entire nation. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, the Republic of China is also becoming increasingly strong, which is truly heartening and encouraging. Seeing that the enemy is determined to fight a short-term decisive battle, relying on its material resources, and counterattacking on all fronts, the war situation is becoming increasingly severe and has reached a critical juncture for the rise and fall of Greater East Asia. It is also a time for each country and ethnic group in Greater East Asia to exert their greatest strength from their respective positions. On this auspicious occasion of the 12th anniversary of the founding of our country, Manchuria is willing to work more closely with the countries of East Asia, fighting courageously with the conviction of certain victory, to defeat the Anglo-Americans and persevere to the end."</p>
<p>Hitler Sends Congratulations</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - According to official announcements, on the occasion of the Manchurian founding anniversary on March 1st, the Führer Hitler sent a telegram to the Emperor of Manchuria expressing his congratulations.</p>
<h3>Remittance Methods Between Huai Province, North China, and Central China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - Since March 1st, the new issuance of banknotes by the United Reserve Bank of China in Huaihai Province has been stopped. The Ministry of Finance has also stipulated remittance management between the province and North China and Central China. The methods obtained are as follows:  Remittances between Huaihai Province and North China will be made in Central Reserve Bank notes from March 1st onwards.  Control of remittances between Huaihai Province and Central China, and between Huaihai Province and North China. (A) Remittances from Huaihai Province to Central China will be freely permitted. (B) Remittances from Central China to Huaihai Province will be allowed up to a limit of 5,000 yuan until the end of March, depending on the procurement situation of materials in the province, increasing from the previously set limit of 1,000 yuan that did not require permission. Whether to remove the restrictions after April 1st will be decided based on the procurement situation of materials. (C) Remittances from Huaihai Province to North China will be freely permitted until the end of March. (D) The same applies to remittances from North China to Huaihai Province, which will be restricted by North China.  An appropriate restriction should be placed on the United Reserve Bank notes carried from Huaihai Province to North China after March 1st. However, due to the relationship with the currency carried by travelers, it is tentatively set at 1,000 yuan in United Reserve Bank notes.</p>

<h3>Impending Mud Season: Germany Adjusts Lines, Intense Battles on Northern and Southern Sections of Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Military sources yesterday received a statement from the German News Agency: The mud season on the Eastern Front is about to arrive early. The frozen ground in the southern sector has begun to thaw, but in the central and northern sectors, temperatures are still between 12 and 15 degrees below freezing. Meteorologists also predict an early arrival of the rainy and mud season. German military experts believe that this climate will be an important consideration when the German army adjusts its lines. Examining the overall situation on the Eastern Front, Berlin also believes that the Soviet army has not achieved its expected goals, failing to break through German defenses or hinder German strategic movements. The German army naturally hopes to occupy advantageous positions before the mud season, so that the muddy ground will not impede its movement.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Fierce battles took place on both the northern and southern sectors of the Eastern Front on Monday. The mud season was accelerated by a sudden cold wave, with temperatures in several areas dropping to 20 degrees below zero, the lowest temperature of this winter. Taking advantage of the weather, the Soviet army used skating divisions and mechanized sleds in an attempt to disrupt German movements. East of Lake Peipus, towards Pskov, the Soviet army is trying to cross the marshland in order to avoid operational delays caused by the changing weather, but has been blocked by the German rearguard. Northwest of Nevel, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive with numerous tanks and several rifle divisions, supported by artillery and aircraft, with the apparent aim of encircling the northern German forces from the south. However, the German army anticipated this and inflicted heavy losses on the initial attack, repelling it. The main front line remains in German hands.</p>
<p>Situation on the Southern Front</p>
<p>Snow in the southern sector has begun to thaw, and torrential rains have fallen in the Dnepr bend. On Monday, the German defense system in this area remained steadfast. The main Soviet offensive continues to be centered on Krivoy Rog. South of the Pripet Marshes, German mechanized units are engaged in a tug-of-war with Soviet cavalry and tank units. In the Crimea region, after a long period of silence, the Soviet army resumed its offensive northeast of Kerch. The Soviet army used smoke screens and heavy artillery support in an attempt to create a gap in the German lines, but was dispersed before reaching the German positions. Only one point penetrated the German lines, but was eventually cleared.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Germany, Air Raid Alarm in London</h3>

<h3>Germany Develops New Anti-Aircraft Weapon Using Radio Wave Principles</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - Anti-Axis air forces have recently been bombing various parts of Germany with large formations of 1,000 to 2,000 aircraft, but have suffered losses of approximately 100 to 200 aircraft due to the fierce counterattacks of the German Air Force. It is generally believed that the achievements of the German Air Force are due to the excellent performance of German fighter planes. It is also believed that the German army has been using new weapons that utilize radio waves in recent air battles. These new weapons can identify whether enemy aircraft are approaching, allowing fighter planes to maneuver effectively. A German weekly magazine has discussed the principles of this new weapon, stating that it works by emitting radio waves into the air. When an aircraft comes into contact with these radio waves, a reaction occurs, allowing for measurement. Furthermore, various methods are used to determine whether aircraft are hostile, even at night. Recently, the German army used a method to thwart attempts by the Anti-Axis forces to use tinfoil to interfere with the performance of this machine. Therefore, although the Anti-Axis forces have dropped large amounts of tinfoil when bombing Germany, they have failed to hinder this highly sensitive device.</p>

<h3>Actively Developing Agriculture and Industry in Manchuria</h3>
<p>The Greatest Harvest</p>
<p>Manchurian agriculture, which bears the mission of completing the self-sufficiency of food supply between Japan and Manchuria, is increasing in importance day by day. There are 34.5 million farmers in Manchuria, accounting for about 80% of the total population of 43 million. Furthermore, the foundation of the low-price policy is built on agricultural products. Thanks to the silent labor of these honest farmers, domestic life is stable. They also fulfill the responsibility of exporting food and oil to mainland Japan, North China, and Korea. According to farmers in Jilin Province, the harvest in 1943 was the rarest in decades, so the impact of the strong collection in the previous year was partially recovered. At present, the peak period of shipping is in full swing. The carts full of grains form a long snake-like queue. The authorities of the Xingnong Department also believe that the shipment of this year's allocated amount is definitely not a problem.</p>
<p>For the shipment of agricultural products, the special allocation of cotton products was also implemented in 1943. Because the shipment was unexpectedly early, cotton products were not even prepared in time, and the whole Manchurian trading place was very active. Also, in view of the great harvest this year (1943), the depletion of land fertility in the coming year must of course be expected. Therefore, farmers follow the careful guidance of the authorities, work hard on fertilization to restore land fertility, and prepare for the inevitable increase in production next year.</p>
<p>The promotion of rice cultivation in Manchuria is also quite remarkable. One or two reclamation areas have harvested a surprising amount of 9 koku of unpolished rice per tan (Japanese area unit, equivalent to 991.7 square meters), and some experimental farmers can harvest 9 tons per cho (Japanese area unit, equal to ten tan) (the average in mainland Japan is 4 tons).</p>
<p>Moreover, there are still 20 million chō of uncultivated land. In addition to some areas in southern Manchuria, the average harvest is not very high due to the prevailing extensive farming methods. Due to land reclamation and improved technology, a large increase in production can be expected in the future. Therefore, the Japan-Manchuria food self-sufficiency policy can be strongly promoted. The problems in agriculture, in addition to the above-mentioned land reclamation and technical improvement, also include the differential gap between the price of agricultural products and the price of consumer goods, the commission fees for revenue officials, the tendency of the subdivision of large farms in northern Manchuria, and the supply of fertilizers and agricultural tools.</p>
<p>Recent Status of Immigration</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the national great mission of the Manchurian immigration policy. However, a large number of Japanese immigrants settling in Manchurian villages is indispensable for establishing a national defense system. This obvious fact should be fully recognized. In this emergency situation, the reason for further advancing the immigration policy lies mostly here. The settlement of land reclamation groups and volunteer corps should also consider the needs of national defense for placement. In terms of increasing production, the land reclamation groups have already achieved a 70% increase in production this year (1942), and now they are launching a campaign to double the increase in production next year. In particular, the transformation of those who used to consume goods in Japanese cities into farmers, and the transformation of Japanese consumers into Manchurian producers, are being carried out on a large scale. Although its strength is weak, it is still a wing to enhance production and is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>The current situation of immigration is as follows: At the end of last year (1942), there were 573 land reclamation groups with 146,000 immigrants; the total number of youth volunteer corps who crossed over to Manchuria was 65,000 (including 26,000 who have been transferred from the volunteer corps to land reclamation groups); and the number of laborers dispatched to Manchuria was 38,000. The cultivated area of land reclamation migrants last year was about 175,000 chō, this year it is 239,000 chō, and next year it is expected to exceed 300,000 chō. The focus of the immigration policy for next year is first to supplement the immigration of each uncompleted land reclamation group. (The above is a partial translation of the Asahi Shimbun in December last year)</p>
<p>Aggressive Increase in Steel Production</p>
<p>The government of Manchuria, in view of the tension of the war situation, sees steel as the center of military power and therefore increasing its production is an urgent task. Therefore, after the integration of the power industry, it merged the three major iron and steel businesses in the country. The merger outline was passed by the Senate Council on the 17th and its contents were announced on the 18th. According to this, the Showa Steel Works (capital of 400 million yen), the Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Company (200 million yen), and the East Border Road Development Company (120 million yen) were merged. The new Manchurian Iron and Steel Co., Ltd. (capital of 740 million drawings, special corporation) was established. The new company has its headquarters in Anshan, and all contracts and procedures have been completed. Business is scheduled to begin on April 1. The purpose of merging iron and steel companies is to meet the urgent requirements of increasing steel production, to comprehensively, organically, and highly utilize the existing technology, raw materials, resources, materials, and equipment of the three companies to increase productivity. The ideal system of Manchurian iron and steel industry has been established so far. Showa, Benxi Lake, and East Border Road three iron and steel companies are sister companies within the scope of Manchurian smoked industry, and have close ties. Since the first five-year plan, they have actively moved towards the development of steel. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asian War, the raw material technology construction plan and other departments should be closer, so the merger of the iron and steel industry is an urgent task to complete the increase in production.</p>
<p>Merger Outline: The business entities to be merged are Showa Steel Works Co., Ltd., Benxi Lake Coal and Iron Co., Ltd., and East Border Road Development Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Regarding the merger (A) Showa, Benxi Lake, and East Border Road three companies merged to establish a new corporation. (B) For the shareholders of the merged company, issue the equivalent new corporate stock.</p>
<p>The new corporation is a special corporation of Manchuria, with a capital of 740 million yen.</p>
<p>The new corporation's head office will be located in Anshan City (the location of the original Showa Steel Works).</p>
<p>Regarding the special quality of steel produced by Manchuria, be sure to ensure its quality and quantity.</p>
<p>The new corporation inherits all employees of Showa. Benxi Lake, East Border Road three companies. (Translated from the Yomiuri Hochi, February 19)</p>

<h3>Permanent Blackout to be Implemented in This City Starting Tomorrow, Joint Announcement by Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Recently, the antics of the US Air Force in Chongqing have become increasingly violent. Recently, they have avoided the sharp edge of the Japanese Air Force and turned to major cities in peaceful areas for blind bombing. Under the strict defense of the Japanese Army in Shanghai and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, enemy aircraft cannot invade, but it is not difficult to predict that enemy aircraft will attempt to invade the suburbs of Shanghai at any time. Therefore, for the thoroughness of Shanghai's air defense, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities previously contacted the municipal government authorities and conducted joint air defense exercises several times to strengthen the air defense lineup. With all preparations now complete, permanent blackout will be implemented in the entire city of Shanghai from March 3rd. Regarding this matter, the Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command issued a joint announcement on the 1st as follows: After March 3rd, the blackout measures in Shanghai will be implemented in accordance with the attached table. The blackout will be implemented from sunset to sunrise.</p>

<h3>Yesterday the 12th Time: Manchukuo National Foundation Day; Manchukuo Consul-General Hosted the Press and Delivered a Speech</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Yesterday (the 1st) was the 12th National Foundation Day of the Empire of Manchukuo. Mr. Ye, the Consul-General of the Manchukuo Embassy in Shanghai, held a tea party at 3 p.m. yesterday at the China Hotel, Room 9, to entertain Chinese and Japanese journalists from this city. The Consul-General delivered a speech on the current situation and his thoughts on the 12th anniversary of the founding of the nation. Subsequently, Mr. Chen, the President of this newspaper, gave a speech in reply. The gathering ended at around 5 p.m. The following is a record of Consul-General Ye’s speech:</p>
<p>Speech by Consul-General Ye</p>
<p>Today (the 1st) is the 12th National Foundation Day of my Manchukuo Empire. In my capacity as the Consul-General of the Manchukuo Empire stationed in Shanghai, I would like to say a few words about my thoughts.</p>
<p>My Manchukuo was founded in the Datong year 1, which is the year 21 of the Republic of China, and has only been around for twelve years. However, the internal security is now completely stable, and there has been rapid development in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. Externally, starting with Japan, we cooperate with friendly neighboring countries, and our diplomatic relations are becoming more intimate and consolidated. At the same time, with all our spirit, we are doing our best to assist in the completion of the unprecedented Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Below, I will briefly introduce the state of Manchukuo's struggle under the Greater East Asia War, for the reference of the new China, which stands on the same ideals and destiny.</p>
<p>Before the founding of Manchukuo, under the politics of warlord misgovernment and banditry, the national administration was chaotic, public security was disrupted, and the poverty of the people reached its extreme. As a result, it became the object of aggression and exploitation by European and American countries. For the sake of the whole of East Asia, the situation at that time was very worrying.</p>
<p>After the Founding of the Nation</p>
<p>However, since the founding of Manchukuo, under the absolute support and assistance of Japan, marching forward under the banner of the great ideals of the Kingly Way, Paradise on Earth, and Ethnic Harmony, public security was established, all administrative affairs were renewed, and culture was revitalized within a few years, forming a very vibrant and orderly state, completely renewing its former appearance. If we say that my Manchukuo is the pioneer of the East Asian New Order movement advocated by Japan today, and that it is the time when East Asian peoples are supporting each other, then it more realistically shows what great power our country can produce. I believe that it can suggest the direction of future progress for China and the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we have been working hard with East Asia as the center. Because of the instigation of the insatiable Anglo-Americans, the situation has worsened day by day, eventually leading to the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident and the tragedy of brothers fighting each other. On the other hand, the endless desires of the Anglo-Americans have caused the Second European War on the European continent. As a result, there was also the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War in the year 30 of the Republic of China. In an unprecedentedly vast area and scale, fierce battles are being fought repeatedly. Manchukuo, in response to this change in situation, has also vigorously raised the power of the whole country and participated in the struggle to preserve the glorious East Asian world. The Greater East Asia War has repeatedly established brilliant war results in the South. The elite of the Kwantung Army are quietly working hard in the frigid North, but the new elite forces of the Manchukuo Army, which have been obviously enriched and perfected in recent years to help with this war, cannot be ignored. Between Japan and the Soviet Union, needless to say, the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Treaty is solemnly in existence. In the ever-changing current international environment, it can be said that the North is maintaining a state of tranquility.</p>
<p>Five-Year Plan</p>
<p>Because we had foreseen today, in the year 4 of Kangde, which is the year 26 of the Republic of China, we established the Manchukuo Industrial Five-Year Plan. Although we encountered various difficulties such as the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident and the outbreak of the European War, as a result of the concerted efforts of Japan and Manchukuo, officials and people, we not only reaped brilliant achievements, but also established the Second Five-Year Plan, attempting to rapidly increase the production of iron, coal, and Ming agricultural products and other materials essential to the war.</p>
<p>Among the grand industrial sectors included in the Five-Year Plan, development requires a large amount of fixed production equipment. In terms of the Dao relationship, the results of this kind of production cannot be expected urgently, but the iron and steel sector of Manchukuo has already completed the initial stage of this kind of foundation and has now entered the production period. However, it goes without saying that we must thoroughly and completely utilize this huge equipment in terms of management, so as to increase the production of war resources and complete the system. For emergency materials, we are currently in the process of expanding production facilities. When these facilities are fully activated, they will definitely produce a surprising amount of iron, coal, and so on.</p>
<p>Secondly, speaking of agricultural products, my Manchukuo has always been known as an agricultural country. Moreover, in wartime, when food resources are easily becoming insufficient, with the awareness and responsibility of being the base station for the Greater East Asia War, we have worked hard to expand farmland and strengthen the value of land utilization. As a result, we have also achieved very reliable results in this regard. Last year, we reached millions of tons of agricultural products. In early January, we had already handed over all of it. In addition to this, there is the so-called "repayment of kindness grain," and we are continuing to hand over agricultural products.</p>
<p>In this way, the former ethnic struggles and undeveloped border lands have been transformed into new countries with ethnic harmony and extremely prosperous industries, completely reaching the point of being a large arsenal and base station for the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>National Training</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only in terms of materials, but also in terms of spirit, as a result of implementing national training in line with a newly emerging country, we have achieved remarkable results. It is not an exaggeration to say that the greatest reason for the leap in materials mentioned above is due to the thoroughness of national training.</p>
<p>First, the Concordia Association, which was organized at the same time as the founding of the country and stands in a two-in-one position with the government, is endowed with the function of "proclaiming virtue and communicating affection." At the same time, it promotes the organization and implementation of youth movements, and trains the minds and bodies of the second generation of citizens. Secondly, even in wartime, it uses a large amount of national funds to work hard to revitalize educational undertakings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the year 7 of Kangde, which is the year 29 of the Republic of China, we implemented the National Military Service Law and promulgated the conscription system, with military training and national training as the greatest goals, and the results obtained have been extremely excellent. Recently, what can be particularly mentioned is the formulation of the Labor Service Law. As a result of this, from January 2nd of last year, we have institutionalized labor service as a national obligation. Therefore, last year, we mobilized hundreds of thousands of young people to engage in simple water management, road construction, and labor in important industries, achieving great results. What can be noted about this system is that it has many benefits for the country and the people in terms of cultivating the national spirit, strengthening the country, and increasing the welfare of the people in both material and spiritual aspects. In this way, although Manchukuo has been founded for only more than ten years, it has completed amazing development in all aspects within the country, which can be said to have a more profound significance for the current situation. In order to cope with this situation, on February 8th of the tenth year of the founding of Manchukuo, we announced the Outline of Basic National Policies of Manchukuo, reflecting on the past achievements of Manchukuo and clearly indicating the way forward for Manchukuo under the grand current situation. The main aim is to thoroughly implement the essence of the nation and uplift the national concept, to consolidate the national solidarity based on the spirit of ethnic harmony, and at the same time to strive for the revitalization of culture and education, to promote the spirit of hard work and national prosperity, so as to strengthen the national strength and stabilize the people's livelihood. Under such a grand policy, the military, government, and people of Manchukuo have become one, doing their best and focusing all their efforts on the completion of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Liberation Holy War</p>
<p>Thinking about it, the Greater East Asia War is a great holy war to liberate East Asia from the demons of the insatiable Anglo-Americans. It is indeed a great decisive battle concerning the rise and fall of hundreds of millions of people in East Asia. That is, whether the East Asian people are willing to forever submit to the exploitation and oppression of the Anglo-Americans, or whether they can complete the order of autonomous co-existence and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations, it all depends on the outcome of this decisive battle. In this sense, the Greater East Asia War is not only a war for Japan, but also not a war that occurred for Japan. In other words, it is a war for the entire East Asia, and a struggle that occurred for the entire East Asia.</p>
<p>Because of the faithful, loyal, and brave struggle of the Japanese army, within half a year after the start of the war, they had almost completely driven out the ugly-skinned Anglo-Americans. Although the decisive battle has not yet ended, there is already a clear and strong dawn of a new order within Greater East Asia. This is the independence of Burma, the establishment of the Republic of the Philippines, and the construction of the Provisional Government of Free India. The entire East Asia is actively moving in an atmosphere of construction. The Greater East Asia Conference held in Tokyo last autumn was a powerful start in the history of the East Asian New Order. The Great East Asia Declaration resolved at this conference is based on Eastern morality and the Japanese spirit. It is a great moral policy that the Anglo-Americans can never achieve. I believe that the pioneer and maker of it is my Manchukuo.</p>
<p>However, the enemy Anglo-Americans are relying on their powerful material and resource power to desperately continue their counterattack. We should not fear this serious fact, nor should we turn a blind eye to it. We should think more deeply about the meaning of this decisive battle, and vigorously rise up to destroy this enemy in one meal. When the East Asian nations unite, what is there to be afraid of? The final victory belongs to us, and we must win. The center of the Greater East Asian countries, needless to say, is naturally Japan, Manchukuo, and China. I think we should solemnly decide that no matter what kind of situation we encounter, we Japan, Manchukuo, and China must support each other and fight to the end in order to build a glorious history for Greater East Asia. I will end my speech here.</p>
<p>Thoughts of the President of This Newspaper</p>
<p>I remember that in the year 20 of the Republic of China, I went to Manchuria once. In half a year, I visited almost all the important places! At that time, Manchuria was still ruled by Zhang Xueliang. It was a typical warlord government. I never expected that after twelve years, such a bright and splendid newly emerging country would be produced in the northeast corner.</p>
<p>Just now, after hearing the speech of Consul-General Ye, we know that Manchukuo's new construction today has been achieved entirely through struggle in the face of difficulties! If the situation were peaceful, I believe it would be even better than it is now! However, it can also be said that it is precisely because it is in a turbulent situation that the government and people of Manchukuo are working together to make efforts, and only then have they achieved today's results.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "When three men are walking together, there must be one who can be my teacher!" Now, China, Japan, and Manchukuo are advancing on the road to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The spirit of Japan and Manchukuo in building the nation is worthy of our emulation. How can we abandon ourselves and not know how to pursue and emulate them?</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War two years ago, Manchukuo has fulfilled the mission and responsibility of a participating country's rear area. The efforts of the past ten years have enabled it to practice the mission of participating in the war with strength. Then, we must also ask ourselves, after our participation in the war, have we practiced our mission?</p>
<p>I have the following three thoughts on Manchukuo's achievements today:</p>
<p>They "say less empty words and bury their heads in work."</p>
<p>The lives of their people may be more difficult than ours on the surface, but the overall strength of the country has increased.</p>
<p>Their success cannot be denied because they have received a lot of help from Japan. But at the same time, we cannot deny that it is due to the joint efforts of the Manchukuo authorities and the people that they have been able to achieve today's success.</p>
<p>The above are just some temporary thoughts I have today. I hope that China and Manchukuo will work together to help our allied country Japan win the victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Perfect Distribution System; Mr. Nikko, Director of the Continental New Daily Editorial Bureau, Asked: "The Japanese distribution system is strictly implemented uniformly throughout the country. I don't know how the Manchukuo distribution system is?" Mr. Matsuda, the Vice-Consul of the Manchukuo Consulate, explained, saying: "The current distribution system in Manchukuo is divided into three types: labor distribution, urban distribution, and rural distribution.</p>
<p>First, during the wartime production increase period, the laborers of various national policy companies have heavier work than ordinary people and a greater mission. Therefore, the amount of distribution is more than that of ordinary citizens. Each person can get 25 to 30 catties of food per month. If the work is diligent and the performance is particularly good, there is still temporary extra distribution. This measure has an award and incentive nature, so everyone works with peace of mind, and the increase in production has become more and more developed.</p>
<p>Second, the urban distribution system is more complicated, so it is carefully considered. Because commercial areas are mostly concentrated in one place, and going from residential areas to stores to shop cannot be done without using transportation, which is quite troublesome. Therefore, according to the population of an area, the number of items in that area, and the number of stores stipulated in a certain area, residents near the store only need to register with it and receive various distributed items on time. In terms of food, people over 25 years old receive about 12 kilograms per month. Children and the elderly are adjusted according to age. The method is good, unlike the crowding of Shanghai citizens waiting in line to receive items.</p>
<p>Third, rural distribution is divided into three festivals a year, namely the New Year's Festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the Mid-Autumn Festival. In addition, during the autumn and winter rainy seasons when crops are harvested, there are also temporary special distributions. Food such as flour is distributed overnight, and other vegetables and fruits are all available in the countryside, so there is no need to distribute other scarce items.</p>
<p>In short, the distribution system in Manchukuo is already very perfect, and in terms of methods, it may be even better than Japan, so it can undertake this wartime mission.</p>
<p>Secondly, Manchukuo values agriculture highly, followed by heavy industry, and light industry relies on Japanese products. However, after the Greater East Asia War, in order to adapt to the needs of the times, we have strengthened heavy industry production on the one hand, and revitalized light industry on the other. In the past two years, we have achieved remarkable results. For items such as medicine, Ajinomoto, and stationery, not only do we not need to rely on imports from Japan, but we also have a large quantity that can be exported to North China and other places.</p>

<h3>No Need to Retake Photos for Residence Permits</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The First Police Bureau’s Baojia Section is aiming to save material resources when renewing residence permits. Instead of requiring new photos, it will use the photos from the old citizen certificates for verification purposes. Yesterday, there was a rumor that citizens should prepare to take photos as soon as possible. The First Police Bureau’s Baojia Section clarified that this news is not true and is conducting a thorough investigation. It is heard that the Baojia Section is actively preparing for the renewal of residence permits. The starting date and detailed procedures will be announced at that time.</p>

<h3>Thoroughly Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices Requires Addressing Both Symptoms and Root Causes; Cracking Down on Hoarding is the First Step</h3>
<p>Recently, the price surge has been particularly severe. Yesterday, reporters visited the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce and the major commodity trade associations to inquire about their opinions on the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices, as well as the factors behind the recent rapid rise in prices. It was reported that the source of goods in this city is extremely difficult due to the impact of overseas transportation disruptions. Therefore, some merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard goods, manipulate, and engage in speculative activities, which ultimately occur one after another.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, in view of this, have long issued notices urging merchants in various industries to abide by standard prices and avoid legal sanctions. If it is necessary to change the highest standard due to cost reasons, the industry association should first state the reasons and submit a cost calculation table to the competent authority for approval before the change is allowed. Otherwise, it will be regarded as privately raising prices. Therefore, the first step at present is to strictly crack down on illegal hoarding, so that all materials can circulate in the market. The next step is to dredge the sources, which can be said to be addressing both symptoms and root causes.</p>
<h3>Various Banks and Financial Institutions in This City Resume Overdraft Transactions</h3>
<p>In order to stabilize finances and assist the government in suppressing prices, the Financial Inspection Department of the Central Reserve Bank restricted all banks and financial institutions last year to recover credit loans within the closing period. After the banks and financial institutions strictly handled the recovery of outstanding debts, most of the previously granted credit accounts have been closed. This year, the banks and financial institutions have also resumed overdraft transactions for closed customers, and the money market seems to be showing signs of loosening. According to sources, almost all of the current overdraft accounts are for production and industrial factories, and the loan targets are industries such as silk and wool weaving, new medicines, chemical raw materials and products, paper making, and tobacco.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Investigate Prices</h3>
<p>In order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Ministry of Industry previously convened a price coordination meeting in Shanghai. It has thorough methods for the price control plan. Currently, the ministry is contacting various relevant parties to take concerted action. At the same time, it has sent personnel to various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai to investigate price conditions and material production conditions, so as to collect and verify information.</p>

<h3>The Issue of Teacher's Exemption from Military Service</h3>
<p>— Ni Weiqiu</p>
<p>Regarding the method of allowing exemption from military service for the self-defense corps, the first district and the eighth district are not very different. In other words, most teachers in the first district are not allowed to be exempted from military service, while teachers in the eighth district are all exempted from military service. In mid-November of last year, the Baojia authorities published exemption regulations, and teachers were also on the list of exemptions. The various joint Bao offices also issued separate notices informing teachers to apply to the Baojia Section for exemption from military service. However, recently, teachers in the former Eighth District are also not allowed to be exempted from military service.</p>
<p>The author is one of the teachers and knows the difficulty of teachers standing guard. I would like to sincerely briefly describe the hardship as follows:</p>
<p>Work Aspect: Teachers are different from ordinary merchants and workers. The work they do is to impart knowledge to the youth and children who most need to cherish their precious time. However, if the time for standing guard is during the day, it will cause dozens of hundreds of students to sit idle for several hours, and the loss cannot be compensated by money. If it is at night, then there is no time to review homework, and too much accumulates, which greatly affects the teaching schedule.</p>
<p>Physical Aspect: Most teachers are physically weak and many have poor eyesight, so they cannot provide much help in guarding. If they are assigned to stand guard at night, their energy will be exhausted, which will inevitably hinder their health. Late sleep and little sleep will affect their spirit the next day.</p>
<p>Economic Aspect: Teachers' salaries are meager. After being assigned to stand guard, if they ask for leave, the school will deduct salary according to the clock hours. If they ask someone to replace them, they have to pay the replacement fee. If they are found out, they will be fined. If they do not stand guard and do not ask someone to replace them, the punishment will be even more severe. With the meager income of teachers, how can they afford this extra expenditure?</p>
<p>Based on these three difficulties, teachers really need to be exempted from serving in the self-defense corps. It is rumored that the reason why teachers have not yet been exempted from military service is that there are many people who pretend to be teachers to apply for exemption. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Special City Education Association will follow the example of the Post Office and compile a list of members who have joined the association and teachers who are indeed employed, even if they have not joined, and submit it to the Baojia authorities for approval of exemption from military service. Then all malpractices such as impersonation and bribery can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Yu, translated by Hong Mou</p>
<p>On Naval Academy (3)</p>
<p>It is said that only with a certain kind of spiritual organization and system can there be such a golden tradition. The way can be imagined, but the foundation, when and by whom it was built, the writer doesn't know. Tracing back to the past, it's like being lost in a dense fog.</p>
<p>Looking into the history of this school, the Naval Training Center established in Tsukiji, Tokyo in the second year of Meiji is its origin. Later, it was renamed Naval Academy Preparatory School, then Naval Academy. In the eleventh year of Meiji, it was moved to Etajima, and the first principal was Junyoshi Kawamura, but it is not necessarily he who laid the foundation for this tradition. It is said that the first principal after the relocation to Etajima was Jinnojo Ariji, but that also seems incorrect. At the time of the relocation, all members boarded the steamship Tokyo No. 9 and came to Edajima. Until the school building was completed, education was conducted on the ship. We can imagine that the spirit of pioneering a new world must have been very fervent. At that time, it already possessed the current general traditions. For example, the squadron system already existed in the preparatory school era. The spirit of autonomy was already visible. The program of overturning dinghies originated from quite ancient times. If one asks current admirals and vice admirals, they can only answer that it existed in their time, but they don't know when and by whom it was invented. However, despite having such ancient traditions, the Naval Academy, with its seventy-year history, does not cling to old habits. For example, the "Five Reflections" mentioned in the previous chapter is a course that even people of the current lieutenant commander level do not know about. Writing weekend reflections in workbooks is also a recent practice. Over a long period, there have been various modifications, abolitions, and additions. However, the fundamentals remain unchanged. It's like a large river gathering small streams, growing ever larger.</p>
<p>In short, the Naval Academy's traditions are traditions, but its spirit is perpetually new. From the first principal to the current principal, there has been no one particularly noteworthy or who implemented a major reform. It is constantly innovating in accordance with the times, like adding new oil to a long-burning lamp. In this, we can understand the mysteriousness of tradition and the correct method of maintaining it. There is no need to force the origin of tradition. The origin probably predates the Naval Training Center. However, after becoming a Naval Academy, the main body of tradition's protectors and inheritors, both in the past and present, has always been the students themselves. This must be specially noted. In the early days of the Naval Academy, it followed the example of the United Kingdom, hiring many British teachers including Gross, to learn military affairs. This is indeed a fact, but it was entirely a relationship of employment. The naval authorities at the time had unexpectedly brilliant insights. It's like a singing or Go teacher. Although they are called "teacher," once the lesson is over, there is no further relationship. It was learning "academics," not spirit. Teaching "academics" was only for a very short period. Afterward, they remained at the Naval Academy as language teachers. The last language teacher left Etajima two years ago.</p>

<h3>Master of Xuanze Hall spends 100,000 on Charity Banquet</h3>
<p>Master of Xuanze Hall recently completed a villa in West Shanghai. Those who knew him flocked to offer congratulatory gifts. The master, considering the difficult times, did not want to follow the extravagance of the world. He took the money saved from the banquet, totaling 100,000 yuan, and used it for charitable purposes. In addition to donating 20,000 yuan to public welfare projects in his hometown of Nanxiang, he donated 20,000 yuan each to the *Xinwen Bao* Poor Children Relief Fund, the Children's Welfare Institute, the *Shen Bao* Poor Medical Aid Fund, and Pushan Villa. The benevolence and righteousness of the Master of Yize Hall are truly admirable.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Hall appeals to all circles</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Hall, located on Huojia Road in Nanshi, has been providing free care for over 110,000 elderly men and women, the disabled, abandoned infants, and the poor and sick for more than 30 years, and has provided diagnoses and medicines for over 2.4 million people. It currently still cares for over 1,000 people, and as prices soar, expenses have increased dramatically. The monthly food expenses alone require over 600,000 yuan. There is no commission and a lack of funds, relying entirely on donations from all sectors of society to maintain operations. Because funds are running out and there is a risk of going without food, we sincerely appeal to all sectors of society to generously donate funds for the entire year's expenses, and especially hope that major philanthropists can sponsor several needy people for several months. For the convenience of all sectors of society to make contact, starting from March 1st, a branch office will be established at 502 Daxing Road (formerly Route des Soeurs), Eighth District. Office hours are from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM daily. Donation collection points: *Xinwen Bao* and this newspaper's Social Service Department, Silk Industry Bank Trust Department at 460 Hankou Road, Jihuatang Pharmacy at 47 Yunnan Road, Huamei Pharmacy at 356 Fuzhou Road, and the Catholic Church on Yinyangbang Road, or notify the branch office to send someone to collect. Telephone number is 83700.</p>
<h3>Symptoms of Meningitis</h3>
<p>Symptoms: This disease has a latent period of three to four days, starting with chills, followed by fever to around 39 degrees Celsius. Traditional Chinese medicine calls it "Spring Warmth Damage Cold." Its special symptoms are headache and stiff neck, so severe that one cannot bend forward or backward, bone pain, vomiting, opisthotonos, coma, and delirium. There are also cases of blurred consciousness and lucidity. The pulse is abnormally fine and rapid, over 100 beats per minute. Breathing is rapid, and the pupils constrict. The tongue coating is thick, greasy, and yellow, initially white and slippery, like the tongue coating of damp-warmth syndrome. Prevention: Isolate patients. Disinfect, for example, the patient's vomit, excrement, sickroom, bedding, utensils, etc. Minimize going to crowded places. Wear a mask when going out. Pay attention to health and nutrition. Eat more radishes and vegetables. Cause: This disease is generally caused by abnormal weather or by latent evil, damp heat, and phlegm stagnation. On the meninges, a stone-salty-juice-like exudate appears, and even the spinal meninges undergo similar changes, and there is a purulent fluid accumulation in the ventricles. This bacterium exists inside cells. Hence the name intracellular diplococcus. Treatment: For this disease, there is spinal puncture, drawing out pus from the spinal canal, injecting serum of this bacterium, and using an ice pillow on the head. However, traditional Chinese medicine mostly adopts "Sang Ju Yin" and "Yin Qiao Ling Yang San," etc. For those with mental confusion and convulsions, enemas and resuscitation and cardiotonic agents such as "Zi Xue," "Zhi Bao Dan," and "An Gong Niu Huang Wan" are also used, all of which are the main special medicines for this disease. In short, both Chinese and Western medicine have their own strengths in treatment. If you see this disease, it is best to seek medical treatment immediately, and do not delay treatment and cause danger. (Bomin)</p>
