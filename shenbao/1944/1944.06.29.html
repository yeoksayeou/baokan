<h3>代論　答客問</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>馬利亞納攀島海戰</p>
<p>問：最近中太平洋馬利亞納羣島塞班島海面的戰局，引起全世界的注意，稱之爲太平洋大決戰的序幕，請問其實際意義如何？</p>
<p>答：這次瑪利亞納群島方面的戰局，其規模之大，動員兵力之多，敵方野心之熾烈，都可說是開戰以來所僅見的大戰役。更就敵美企圖在塞班島方面的戰略形勢來看，該島南距東京爲二千四百公里，向爲日本海軍作戰海域的中心。北而東京·橫濱·大阪，東而大島島及馬紹爾群島的大部份，南而俾士麥群島以至新幾內亞一帶重要島嶼，西而日本的南九州，琉球群島的大部份乃至菲律賓的東南部，都在以該島爲中心的一千哩半徑圈內。因此，該島實爲保衛大東亞全域的中心地區，這一地區的大戰，對於東亞整個戰局，具有重大的意義。</p>
<p>問：如此看來，敵方竟孤軍深人到日木最大防衛中心有所行動，實在是一種最為愚蠢的冒險了。為甚麼在此歐洲侵攻作戰方告開始之時，敵人會這樣愚蠢的冒此大險？</p>
<p>答：敵美這次冒險的動機，可就政戰二略加以分析，戰略是依從於政略的，現在先就政略方面來看。關於東亞作戰，美英當局過去都曾有極輕率的發言，結果美英軍事着着失敗，國民對於政府的信仰大為减削。現在爲了維緊其對內對外的信譽，表示美國力能東西同時作戰，不得不冒險蠻幹。其次，最近日軍大舉推進大陸作戰，重慶軍在河南及湖南慘遭挫敗，瀕於潰敗之境，負有持殊使命該渝的美副總統華萊士適在此時抵達重慶，實有啼笑皆非之苦，美方首腦乃更不惜冒險，以圖振作渝方十氣緩和國內與論。</p>
<p>問：戰略方面的企圖如何？</p>
<p>答：政略方面，完全出於被動，實質上只有冒險而已。因此在戰略方面，也就錯誤百出，第一，敵美對於日本海軍，固然久存畏懼之心，但誤認日本海軍只知固守本土；更誤認日本海軍可以誘而聚殲之；因此有這次冒險；第二，由於過去兩年來「跳島作戰」戰略巳被日軍完全擊破，乃思改變方針，不惜以更大的犧牲，圖襲最接近日本本土的基地，以期轉捩整個東亞戰局。</p>
<p>間：敵人政戰兩略，原來都是這樣不顧現實，無怪要遭受嚴重的打擊了。請問這次塞班島作戰經過如何？</p>
<p>答：六月十五日晨，來製瑪利亞納群島之敵軍，企圖於塞班島登陸，前後二次，但於海面即被擊退。至是日下午奪得該島一角後，即逐漸增加兵力，但遭日軍守備部隊邀擊，予以重創。同時，出現於馬利亞納羣島附近之敵，乃以航空母艦及戰艦為主幹之大機動部隊，且將太平洋方面艦隊之大部集中於該方面，日航空部隊積極施以攻擊。迄六月十九日日軍聯合艦隊之一部，於瑪利亞納羣島西方海面，包圍敵機動部隊，至二十日計擊沉及擊毀敵航空母艦五艘，戰艦一艘以上。二十三日日航空部隊更形活躍，先後擊沉擊毀敵戰艦四艘，航空母艦十一艘以上，巡洋艦六艘。至此敵艦隊已不得不被逼遁回了。</p>
<p>問：聽說此次敵方出動艦隊十分之八，其作戰之決心與野心甚大，爲什麽這樣輕易的就給擊敗了？</p>
<p>答：前面我已說過，這次敵美對馬利　納羣島作戰，是富有冒險心理的，但是他們的政略和戰略，却都毫無根據，其失敗原不足異。從政略方面說，美國實際却是企圖恢復殖民地奴隸統治，這是東亞各民族所共知的。共次，在戰略方面，誠如前任日本聯合艦隊司令長官末次大將所說：「從來遠離木國要塞之艦隊出擊，均屬自取滅亡。」「　論歷史上元兵寇邊時，日俄戰時巴爾基庫艦隊，再古如西班牙馬爾馬達艦隊，　薩拉尼斯海戰各公例觀之，雖恃物量，但至達方作戰，絕無徼倖之例。」今敵人距離補充綫珍珠灣仍有三千三百海里，而日方則近如戶側，日軍養精蓄銳，以逸待勞，海陸空軍協伺，隨時可予敵方以嚴重的打擊。所以孰勝孰敗，巳無待　卜。</p>
<p>問：那麼馬利亞納羣島作戰的趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：據我們觀察，此次敵人進攻塞班島，雖有極大野心，目的或在引誘日方主力艦隊出戰。但當日本主力艦隊的一部分開到，先以航空部隊轟炸美艦隊，予以重大打擊，終於被逼遁回·日本大本營海軍報道部長栗原大佐說得對：「此次所予敵軍之損害，已相當重大，但若與此次來侵之敵兵力相較，僅為其一部份而已，實未能決定戰局。故今後在該方面，非與海陸空之全力澈底消滅來侵之敵不可。」我們站在大東亞民族解放戰中盟國之一的立塲，必須加倍努力，協助盟邦，準備最後的決戰，迎接最後的勝利·我可借用末次信正大將之言奉獻於國人：</p>
<p>「今後之一剎那，卽為日將士殺敵之寶貴時間，諸君其靜待好消息之傳來！」</p>
<h3>日空軍猛烈轟炸　阿斯里特飛機塲　塞班周圍島嶼空襲益激烈</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　塞班島方面之日空軍，與地上部隊協力作戰，同時並於二十六日夜襲擊該島南部之阿斯里特飛機塲，與以猛烈轟炸，將之炸毀並起火，日軍方面無損害。日軍機隊是日又曾轟炸該島西方加拉邦南方之敵軍需推積所，命中多數炸彈，而發生爆炸，釀成大火災，日軍於高奏凱歌聲中，安全返防。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　美空軍對塞班島周圍各島嶼之空襲，已日趨激烈，尤以對大宮島為甚。二十七日計有艦救戰鬥機六十乃至一百架來襲該島，但日駐軍立即將敵機擊退。此外，另有敵機六十架來襲羅特，經日軍迎擊，卒被擊退。</p>
<h3>龍川石江南霪雨　將展開平原大戰　陸空兩方面渝補給困難</h3>
<p>怒江前綫日軍某基地二十八日中央社電　雲南遠征軍渡過怒江，侵入日軍之雲南龍陵，購衝地區後，因後方接給路綫受惡劣天氣阻止，甚感苦惱，其由怒江上流渡河之渝第二十集團軍主力數師，刻正自龍川，石江方面南下，日軍亦　集新銳部隊，準備在霪雨泥濘之雲南平原，予渝軍以莫大打擊。據俘虜言，渝僅作熾烈反攻二次即告敗北，二十一聯隊新近呼號作第三次反攻，調來一師援軍，名爲援軍，實則多數傷兵，經重新編制者。自怒江作戰開始以來，至六月二十三日，判明渝軍共遣屍計千四百五十餘具，戰死戰傷被俘則達二萬餘人，渝軍第二次對怒江方面作緊密攻勢，實毫無效果。</p>
<p>仰光二十八日中央社電　北緬敵軍前會驅使渝美聯合大軍侵攻富貢地區，以謀打開侵攻東京（越南）之路綫，但經日軍攻擊後，抗戰半年來，已蒙重創，彼等奪回緬甸之企圖，隨雨季之降臨，早無實現可能，於是史蒂維爾於焦慮之餘，乃使經短期間訓練之駐印渝軍空輸部隊降下北緬要衝密芝那，以謀奪取該地區，但此項空輸部隊由於日軍不斷猛攻，空中補給缺乏與惡疫流行等種種關係，已失戰意，最近投降者，層出不窮。現空輸部隊在北緬之密林地帶已呈支離潰滅之窘狀，截至二十三日止，渝空輸部棄屍已達四千五百餘具，茲若將員傷者，俘虜，投降兵合計在內，則渝軍損害實突破一萬人。目下日軍各部隊爲期掃蕩敗殘渝軍，刻正到處展開奇襲包圍戰，由於北緬雨季降臨，渝軍在陸空兩方面，補給俱感困難，而在補給方面，美軍佔優先權，反之，多數渝軍則使能食美軍之殘餘而已。本月二十四日，渝兵八名歸順日軍，據稱：美兵心性奸險，自己食肉飲乳，並將美酒藏於衣內，對渝軍僅予甘蔗一節，每日如此，並未介意，又稱：印度兵若欲吸烟，必須代美兵掃除鐵銹，美兵之無道行爲，於戰塲屢見不鮮，彼等僅於國內受三四個月養成軍訓。胆量極小，不敢獨行於密林中，夜間行動常置渝軍於前，渝兵染　疾或傷寒，美醫並不予以醫治，而施其自然，因此，在印渝軍空輸部隊只知抗戰絕望，憎惡美軍之情感，日甚一日，渝全軍在日軍包圍網中，正在投降或滅亡之途中。</p>
<h3>日思想決戰會　昨正式成立　每月十八日召開例會</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日思想決戰委員會，決以前駐義大使現衆議院議員白鳥敵夫氏任會長，於二十七日午後二時，假　關會館舉行成立典禮，白鳥會長以下要員十數名均出席，決定委員會之目標爲　宣揚皇道。　與盟邦共運命思想之澈底。　對毒惡思想之研究。　暴漏敵之謀略宣傳。　財政經濟方策之研究。　世界新秩序之具體的研究等，更就各問題詳加研討，至午後五時散會。又該委員會今後每月十八日召開例會，隨時將所決定之草案提供當局。</p>
<h3>橫山情報官昨發表談話</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日情報局第三部橫山情報官，二十八日下午會見駐日中浦記者，特就美副總統華萊士此次訪渝及英生產相李特爾頓失言事，發表談話如次：「美副總統華萊士此次訪渝，已與蔣介石發表共同聲明，該聲明中最使吾人注目且感興趣者，則為使亞洲諸民族於一定時間內付與自治權限一事。然此事自去歲大東亞會議發表共同宣言，以及日本對華實施新政策後，亞洲諸民族如緬·菲·印度等皆已先後自主獨立矣，故彼等所聲明者，我等早已實施矣。美國為使中國作爲其軍事基地，始有此次華萊士之訪渝，然其利用中國爲其軍事基地之計劃，果能成功與否，徵諸河南，湖南兩役，即可詳知矣。關於英生產相李特爾頓說美國爲今次日美戰挑撥者之失言事，不止李特爾頓一人，美國內更檢舉三十人（，被判為叛亂罪，蓋因彼咸謂「日本絕非此次戰爭之挑撥者，換言之實爲美國」，以上三十人刻已被判十年監禁或十萬罰金。</p>
<h3>芳澤大使　發表談話</h3>
<p>西實二十八日中央社電　日駐越芳澤特派大使，二十日於達拉特曾與德古總督會談，二十五日返西貢，二十六日晚於官邸會見日記者團，發表談話如次：美英於歐州登陸之際，余在河內，當時曾接德古總督希望早日會談之公文，於是乃在豫定期前急赴達拉特，會談之經過，頗稱順利。德古總督曾再三表示，無論本國發生任何事悄，該地絕不變化對日協力之方針。在越南支持貝當政府之現階段，帝國對越南之方針亦絕對不變，關於此點，余與德古總督意見完全一致。美英對越南之謀略，行將逐次熾烈，余曾要求越南當局，積極講求對策，德古總督已向各方面發出命令，指示辦法，該地之法蘭西人，對於本國之近况不無懸念，然法國本國現在似甚平靜，越南當局刻下之情形，亦極為平靜。</p>
<h3>高級航空燃料　不發生猛毒　日赤塚博士發明</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日軍生省硏究所技師赤塚京治醫學博士，頃對高級航空燃料之大量生產上，貢獻顯著，海軍省軍需局長特對該博士授與表彰狀，該表彰式曾於二十七日下午，在關係官列席下，於該局長室舉行·按赤塚博士，曾使一向仰賴外國之高級航空燃料使之國產化，但最感困難者，即於生產過程中發生猛毒，對此，氏於公務之暇，親身對其科學之防止對策，繼續研究後，終確立防毒之對策而成功。如斯，誇耀於世之日本高性能航空燃料，因防毒施設之完備，生產大見增加，全體生產戰土，已由悲慘之戰業病中，皆已得安心獻身於生產工作。赤塜傳士於福島縣曾發表談話如次：研究之內容方法，非對中毒之工員實行注射或與以藥劑，將作業工程上所發生之猛毒，使與挺身作業之工員兩相遮斷，即時發散猛毒之通風換氣，紫外光綫之吸收等全面之工塲施設，加以根本改善，而不使之發生中毒患者，我國之此種施設，確信實可誇耀於世，不僅達成增產目的，且工員不致中毒，實甚欣慰不已。</p>
<h3>甘地續進行　反英鬥爭</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　印度政府與甘地翁之關係，最近由於政府方面之表示挑撥態度，益行惡化。茲甘地翁似已採取毅然決然之態度，不　英印當局之逮捕，續行反英鬥爭。據路透社浦那電，甘地翁曾於二十六日毅然要求印總督華維爾與之會晤，藉以檢討時局，但華維爾對甘地翁此要求，將採取如何措置，此實堪注目。</p>
<h3>銓釵部變通　審查辦法</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電　國民政府銓釵部，自民國三十一年一月辦理公務員任用審查以來，為體念公務員於事變後收集者，特予以變通辦理。由該部開列應補證件清單，分別而知原送審機關，轉飭照補，俾可依法合格，以資補救。詎自辦理以來，每有延至數月，甚至逾期尙未照補，與該部初意及所期效果，適得其反。茲悉該部爲澈底淸理以經已辦未結之積案計，除分函各原送審機關，勒限嚴催，以後中央及各地方機關送審各公務員，務須將所有證件，隨表檢齊附送。其證件不齊，雖表塡資歷相符，亦不再通知，即憑原送證件，依法審查，從速決定合格或不合格，其不合格者，得依照公務員任用法施行細則第十六條之規定，於文到一個月內，聲請複審，以一次爲限。</p>

<h3>日軍突人衡陽　渝受重大威大脅　出淵報道部長談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊盟邦日本在滬陸軍部報道部，於昨（廿八）日下午二時半，循例假南京路外灘華　出席。即席談此次潮南作戰，日軍進展神速，已突入衡陽敵美在渝空軍之擴大根據地，以及佔領洛陽·長沙‘在軍事上之意義·頗使渝方喪失屛門，蒙受嚴重打擊。並促使渝方從速省悟。最後對反軸心之侵歐作戰，曁美軍在太平洋上之戰鬥行動，不足重視，並不如彼輩所理想之進展。茲誌氏談話如次</p>
<p>影響重大　出　部長首謂，閱於湖南戰況，據前綫來訊稱，本月廿四晨拂曉，日軍神速突入衡陽機塲，守備該地之渝軍約二師左右，正被日軍展開激戰中。深信於較短時期內，即可予以解決。查衡陽為美在渝空軍在華中最大之前進根據地，自大東亞戰爭爆發以後，渝美雙方空軍，即狼狽在衡陽從事建設一切根據地。且衡陽地名在最近國際上頗負盛名，因此日軍對該渝方要衝，決採取使命上的攻勢，給於渝方軍事上精神上之影響非淺。此次日軍進攻衡陽意義，除可打擊敵美制於死命，獲取重要戰果外，同時在佔領衡陽後，又掌握平漢粵漢之交通綫，從而以衡陽為中心，以確保該交通綫（包括鐵道公路水路），衡重對贛·問·桂·粵·川·　各省之壓力。如今日軍在華大陸中央部份業已獲得頗大成就，除突入衡陽，及佔領北部河南入洛陽，湖南之長沙，日之已深入渝方重要屛門。益使中國大陸東部蘇·浙·皖·閩·粵·等各省與內打擊。而駐渝之外籍記者，為此亦迭發消息，以衡陽之陷落，在軍事上，經濟上，較長沙更為嚴重。應速反省從茲在反國軸心陣容方面，又造成焦慮窘境，將深恐渝方脫　反軸心之現象，特鄭重考慮，以挽回頹勢。此外美國內心急燥尤甚，今次渝軍之失敗事實，更使美太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米茲之企圖，完全粉碎。尼本人主張假用中國大陸，以進攻日本本上，自渝軍事上之失敗，渠之計劃遂告瓦解。同時在西南太平洋之美司令長官麥克沃塞所主張之跳島作戰，在側面亦慘受嚴重威脅，故彼輩之企圖，短難實現。由此美在太平洋上之作戰，恐將發生重大之紛歧意見。試　美在渝空軍之無力表現，益使彼輩惶恐不安，甚且渝政權之腐化，依賴外人之力量，利用掩蔽本身之失敗，對目前美海軍在塞班島之　戰，抱過大之期望，反而對日軍在大陸作戰估計過小，此種自得其樂，自暴自棄之態度，今後將遭受毀滅本身存在之結果。　以此關心反軸心侵入歐洲，及太平洋美軍之進展，而忘却本身要衝失落，嚴重威脅置之度外，將一切生命財產，寄託他人之肩，如此糊塗，殊甚痛恨。自以英美早日得勝，本身亦可擠於戰勝國之列，此種痴人妄想，應及早從速予以深刻反省。而反軸心之侵歐作戰，及太平洋美軍之作義行動，斷難達到彼輩理想上之進展。</p>
<h3>華鐵決協助　米糧運輸</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電當局為緩和京滬食米，除制定京滬兩地民食米臨時措置綱要，並令華鐵予以方便，惟迄今多未合理想。記者特訪有關當局，據云華鐵以處戰爭狀態下，係　軍管理，致一切運輸咸以軍事為第一，而於民運不得不置於次要，一般民衆應體時艱。惟當局於可能範圍內，予以便利，以輔當局，而收抑降米價之實效。</p>
<h3>衡陽附近激戰</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電據渝中央廣播，日軍於粵漢綫東西兩地區，分頭南進，會師於衡陽東方後，復分兵兩路，一路進攻衡陽東北角，一路進攻衡陽飛機塲，目下衡陽近正激戰中。</p>
<h3>華北設第二　直轄行政區</h3>
<p>南京二十八日中央社電華北政務委員會總務應次長張仲直，二十七日上午在外交大樓會見中日記者團，就自此次第二直轄行政區之設置問題，談稱如下：去年十一月下旬，劃定永清·固安·安次·　縣·四縣為第一直轄行政區，實施再建以來，成績異常良好。當局有　及此，乃更劃冀東道全區十縣一市，為第二直　行政區，較第一區節團為廣，更有政治上之特殊性，乃河北省之重要地區，北臨滿洲，其重要產業地區，有開　煤　熙出，工業地有唐山，直轄區之特色，乃在集中軍政官民之總力。而謀行政之推行。其中尤以共匪悵深蒂固，為剿減共匪，實有集中總力之必要也。</p>
<h3>北平價漸落</h3>
<p>北平二十八日中央社電　北平物價春初曾一度狂漲，三月下旬漸漸下落。最近如棉織品。米柴，肥皂，香烟，食油等日用雜貨。一青暴跌，一般民衆大為歡欣。察其跌落月起改為一人十公斤。三，取締奸商囤積，工作收效，而將沒收之囤積品，按照公定價格配給市民。結果五月份粟價較二月份跌九分，玉米跌落一成七物價趨益安定云。德砲隊轟擊敵展開綫收效</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蒂　區大戰，二十六日竟日編續中，英軍雖　受重大死傷，但仍在霍托特（Hottot）與諾萊（Norrey）之間向南壓迫，但霍托特附近之一切進攻均遭挫敗。蒂萊兩旁加拿大軍第三步兵師團與英第三步兵師團，在大戰中蒙受嚴重之損失，敵工兵以擲火機進攻德軍要塞，備受猛烈之砲火，其中一部份工兵在其擲火機被擊中時斃命。沿克　恩至　維格尼未發生重要之戰事，强　大　軍展開之運動，這德　砲隊有效之轟攻，敵展開顯示其在該區之攻勢計劃。同時最近在橋頭堡登陸之美第八軍團，正在柯坦汀半島之南部戰。該處自星期日以來砲火愈見緊張，總攻擊雖猶未發動，但德砲隊轟攻敵之入口處與展開綫，頗見成效。電倫敦昨晚宣布：反軸心軍陸戰隊司令桑達斯少將，巳在諾曼第前綫陣亡德軍當局發表：瑟堡市內</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　海通社訊，據倫敦息：反軸心軍事當局業已動員英美最優長之工程師及打撈船舶工人，企圖恢復瑟堡炸毀船塢。海通社軍事訪員塞托留斯心之海空軍力甚多，此項兵力現又可移作他處軍事行動之用，敵軍是否將在大西洋沿岸其他地點，再取大規模之登陸行動，抑暫以諾曼第橋頭堡　進攻根據地，當視今後之發展始可分曉。後者則需先在柯坦汀與卡爾伐陀等地補充其登陸部隊，尤需向南擴大卡爾伐　橋頭堡，然後可向東面與面南採取大規模之攻勞。但敵電另在其他地點，實行大規模登陸，作攻歐之主力，亦自有其可能。　之，德軍司令部早有應付準備，侵歐三週作戰，德軍得保持其實力，實軍事當局應付有方之明證。</p>
<h3>蘇軍鉗形攻勢　抵明斯克區</h3>
<p>奧爾厦德軍突破重圍</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德國新開社訊：蘇軍此次在中路發動大規模夏季攻勢，顯然擬在坦克車與機械部隊掩護下，作廣大之句圍行動，敵向巴勃魯伊斯克德軍陣地猛攻之分隊，與由維特勃勒斯方對勃魯伊斯克增加壓力，以致該處德軍防綫不得不撤退若干據點，敵迭以企圖向巴勃魯伊斯克突破，均在該市鎭之南被阻，敵死傷甚衆。莫奇列夫之德軍前陣地亦不得不撤退至巾鎭之邊沿，同時附近地區之德軍亦向聶伯河綫後退。</p>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電德國新聞社訊，軍息：東綫中部維特勃斯克</p>
<p>（武漢訊）日軍在河南湖南兩地域開始作戰以來已經數月，作戰順利進行，鄭州，洛陽及長沙等渝軍要地，先後陷落，戰事尚在進行中，頃有日本從軍記者，因事由前綫回來，此間報進班特于六月二十四日邀請該記者及中國方面通訊社報館記者舉行座談會，從軍記者談及日軍今次作戰對于中國一般民衆如何同情，令人感佩，茲將座談會　錄誌後：軍記者：海野秀雄（讀賣新開社特派員），秦泉寺淸三（同盟通信社副參事），大島右助（朝日新聞社漢口支局長）：　報道班：某高級軍官　中報者咒：大楚報，武漢報，申報及中央電訊社各記者。道班員：今天承蒙各位記者業臨非常感謝。現在先請海野先生說明河南方面的情形。</p>
<h3>日軍秋亳無犯</h3>
<p>海野：我是在華北方面從軍已經兩個月，這次跟着平漢鐵路南下，我記得以前日軍佔領某一個城市或鄕村，逃避四鄕的居民，非經過數月之後，不肯回到原來住所，可是這一次的淸彩大為同了，無論那一個城或者那一個村，日軍進駐以後，不到兩三天，就有許多居民，陸續的歸來，靑年的女子也在街上毫無畏懼的貴着，這個原因是在那裹呢，因為日本兵對千每一個中國老百姓都抱持和愛的態度，以使中國民衆感覺日本兵不是以中國民衆為敵人的，我可以舉幾個例子，本來軍隊進駐任何地方，照例藉用民房為臨時宿舍，這次全軍都宿在戶外，沒有一個兵進入中國民房打擾，不但一個兵卒，通高級的部隊長雖在大雨潭泥的晚上也在路上搭帳蓬過夜經過有一件事，河南農村，現在大麥長成農民都期待着收獲的日子快到，日本軍隊經過農村時侯，這路上到處有渝軍所埋沒的他雷，非常危險，所以若是走過麥田，那是最安全的了。可是不忍破壞中國農民辛辛苦苦耕種的成果，他們還是走上明知有危險物的退路上，有一時我因為糧食缺乏，看見菜園裏有許多黃瓜成熟，意欲採下充饑，剛想踏進園中，忽然給一位軍官制止了，凡一個部隊作戰本部需要桌凳，希望到民房去暫時借用，但因民衆均已逃避，無法徵求，祇得拿來使用，但是部隊奉命出發臨行之時，所有一切借來的家貝具全送到原來地方安置，速一件東西也沒有遣失。以上所說種種情形，是在過去作戰中從未見過的，這次日軍規律的業　可想而知。鄭州陷落後，日軍進城也是頗有秩序，所以不過幾天，居民紛紛來歸，一星期以後，治安維特會便能成立，十日之後，完全恢復原來狀態，其他地方最遲也不滿一個月，市容復興舊狀。</p>
<p>西島：河南方面的日軍對於中國民衆怎樣要好，剛才由海野先生說明得很淸楚，現在請秦泉寺先生說明湖南地域日本軍的情形。</p>
<h3>居民相率來歸</h3>
<p>秦泉寺：我在湖南方面從軍。也隨時見到和海野君所說同樣的事情，我們到達任何一隊日軍先鋒兩三天以前經過的鄕村，道路水田，房屋等一點都沒有破壞。農家們前晒着洗好衣服，還有耕牛猪羊個畜甫的，看風見景這赽想不到兩三天以前有帶着軍火的大批軍隊留駐此地，這都是證明日軍關懷中國百姓回家之後的生活，連一草一木都沒有動過。我到了洞庭湖的一個鄕村時候，因為有點閒空的時間，帶着軍隊裏的朋友坐船遊玩，看見岸上忽有幾個日本兵捉住一隻小牛捆繫他的四足，想要殺牠，剛剛這時候有憲兵走過目睹這情形，嚴厲亂的殺敎　中訓國一頓而把那隻小牛放去了。中國農民知道日軍進來，都要逃避，他們在離鄉里七八公里的地點，觀望形勢，後來知道日軍不害老百姓，不到三四天，先後回到日軍駐屯的地方來，可見他們怎樣信用日軍。</p>
<p>西島：現在請大島先生講吧。</p>
<h3>親善的事實</h3>
<p>大島：我也是從軍湖南地區記者的一個我所從軍的部隊在某一地點住宿，附近有村落一所，兵士們拿　頭食品等到村落去，看見　鴨豬等，我以為他們把特捉了，當為晚餐，不料那幾個和愛的兵士們，開罐頭拿出裏邊的東西來給鷄鴨等吃，我想像湖日南本風，明士兵們好像愛他們的故鄕，一樣來愛浩湖南的風物，又有一次軍隊，就耍開拔，全體忙於準備，出發的時候，看見一個兵士在一個中國民房並且拿自備的藥來給他，我問他甚麽理由，他告訴我他們一家人對他和其他的日本兵很好泡茶送水果，以表示慰問，現在我們部隊要前進了，因為我不會說中國話，所以我拿我自備的藥送給他們的母親，這是我感謝他們意思。我想在抗戰地區的中國民衆，從來沒有人敎他們實行中日親善，可是互相以人類的愛心來對待，那末自然會發生親善的事實。（未完）</p>

<h3>交通遮斷地域　通行辦法公布　日陸海軍當局發表吿示</h3>
<p>日上海陸海軍防空司令部日前曾經發布告示，將　報發佈時之交通統制規則，予以修正，即今後當警戒警報發出後，一般車輛及通行人，均應暫停通行五分鐘，以免交通發生紛亂。查以往上海海軍特別陸戰隊，上海警備隊及上海憲兵隊原發有「交通遮斷地域通行許可設明書」一種，持有該項證書者，雖在警報發出後及發生意外事件，而禁正通行之際，亦得特予通過，惟截至目下止，持有該項許可蹬者，為數似達相當多數，且證書之樣式亦紛歧不一，故以上三機關為免引起混雜之處起見，此次特將該項許可證加以統一辦理。凡業經發出之通行許可證，自七月七日起一律無效，凡確有使用該項許可證必要者，應須一律重向第一或第二警察局轉請頒發，由陸戰隊警備隊及憲兵隊加以嚴格潠擇後，對認為確有必要者，始予發給，以上三機關特於二十九日發佈告示如次：</p>
<h3>吿示</h3>

<h3>本市銀行業　昨開會員大會　通過六要案改選理監事</h3>
<p>上海特別市銀行業同業公會，依據會章之規定，於昨（二十八）日下午三時舉行第十五屆會員常十餘人，由該會理事長葉扶霄主席致開詞，林秘書長康侯報告會務。討論通過：　修訂銀行業業規，　通過本年上屆決算及下屆預算，　通過本年下屆提高徵收特別費，　通過調整會員出席代表名額，通過民益銀行申請入會，　通過加强公會內部組織，由秘書處改為總務稽核兩處。旋即改選本屆理監事，至五時許散會。</p>
<h3>會務報吿</h3>
<p>林秘書長康侯報告本屆會務云：自去年十二月二十九日召開第十四屆會員常會以來，又及半年，在此期間上海金融市塲，銀根不見鬆弛，股票日益低落，但因投機囤積之風稍形歛迹，一般遊資略趨正常，故金融大體，常稱穩定。此半年來政府頒發關於金融事業之法令，約達二十餘件，如「檢發公司增資登記限制暫行辦法」，「轉實業部辦理公司組織之銀行錢莊補行登記期限及其辦法」，「華北華中聞通匯限制之廢止」，「抄發建設公債第一期發行辦法」，「三十二年甲乙種糧食庫券條例」，「調整淮海省通貨制度」，及「聯銀券與中儲券會同交換」等等，而最關重要者，更有數端：</p>
<p>禁止銀行自身購貨囤積政府對此令行公會，切實查明，認眞檢舉，報部懲辦。同時又有本市第一區公署經濟處為同業公會應監督會員經營業務，倘有違反及隱匿不報，公會負實人，應予處分之訓令。本會為安定社會經濟，保持金融光塲，除分轉各會冒外，並切屬　重注意，各會員當能深體此旨。</p>
<p>實行所得稅新稅率所得稅處上海區微收局於三月一日實行以新稅率，聞微三十二年度第一類甲乙兩項當利事業所得稅，本會以各銀行早經辦理年終决算，並有召開股東會，已將盈餘分配者，事後追溯，　得殊多，即稅率方面，亦頗有可資研究之處，因與錢業公會兩度會銜備文呈請展緩一年實施，均以案經最高國防會議通過，殊難變更，未能邀准所請。</p>
<p>禁止理償英美等貨幣查美金英磅港幣等買賣交易，及滙兌，自三十一年七月後早經禁止在案，惟在銀行方面之外幣存欠，客戶或有不甚明晰，要求准許以中儲券折合了結之事，銀行頗感艱於　付，為此曾呈請財政部核示，嗣奉批在外滙未恢復交易前，對於上項貨幣之存放欵項，禁止收付，亦不許以中儲券折合了結等因，並通令各地銀錢業公會遵照辦理。其他會務之有關全體同業者之報告從略。</p>
<h3>松島部長對渝澳　發表廣播演說　「美艦隊擊滅之日益近」</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，於二十七日下午十時十分在上海電合，對重慶及澳洲方而，發表廣播演說，題為「美艦隊擊滅之日益近」。茲誌大要如次：</p>
<h3>決戰熊勢日益濃厚</h3>
<p>自六月十一日敵美軍之有力機動部隊，出現於馬里亞納羣島方而以來，太平洋戰局益見重大，決戰熊勢，日益濃厚。目下之情勢，乃敵軍良經六月十九日，二十日二次海戰遭受重大損害以來，一時業已脫出我軍攻擊圈外，然為顧　具在塞班登陸之二師餘兵力起見，仍逗留於附近海面，意圖支援塞班島之陸上作戰，同時並謀截斷我軍之補給錢，不時空製硫黃島。</p>
<h3>準備迎擊來襲敵軍</h3>
<p>目前塞班島方面之日美激戰日益猛烈，買可決定大東亞戰局將來之運命如何。敵英美為岡掩飾其重大損害，及作戰上之不利，一意從事虛偽宣傳，其方法誠屬惡辣，殊應加以相當注意。英美之在太本洋從事總反攻，早為一般所預料，羅斯福亦鷹稱與歐洲侵攻作戰同時發動。然不問敵方之宣傳如何，我國戰力惟見日益增進，如五月二十日陸軍大學舉行畢業禮時，東條參謀總長曾對學生訓示，表示戰局已至轉換之重大時機，日軍精銳部隊，已採取決戰配備，準備迎擊來襲之敵軍云云。敵目於一月三十日進入馬紹興羣島以來，雖屢經　大宣傳，然徒空費時日，毫無進展，此乃因探知特魯克及我方其他重要據點，防備嚴密，所謂太平洋中央突破，並非容易之故。自五月二十七日敵侵攻新幾內亞之必阿克鳥以來，戰局少重心，已移至該方面，然敵在該方面遭受我軍強烈抵抗，乃不得不改變其路綫。</p>
<h3>政略戲劇窮極無聊</h3>
<p>至六月六日英美之歐洲侵攻作戰正式展開，然在精强之德軍之前，一籌莫展，反而遭受莫大之損害。英美為挽救對反軸心國及中立國方面對自已之信望起見，乃亟圖轉換局面，窮極無聊，乃決定由美軍進攻馬里亞納方面。換言之，即美軍之此次進攻馬里亞納幷非由人戰本來之使命出發，純為挽救歐洲戰事僵局及呼應華萊士訪問重慶等等政略的戲劇。</p>
<h3>當選理監</h3>
<p>當選理監，理事長葉扶霽，常務理事吳震修，唐壽民，朱如堂，朱博泉，理事潘久芬，陳子培，項叔翅，陳朵如，孫鶴皋，吳蘊齋，孫瑞璜，沈叔玉，王伯元，吳仕勤，陳振九，周文瑞，陸允升，許敬甫，王海波，孫仲立，劉吉生等監事吳蔚如，梁冠榴，金觀賢，王爾藩，程仲藩，殷煥之，黃雨齊，許容甫等，候補理事李祖基，沈長明，徐懋棠，劉聘三，洪貞良，吳少亭，林漢甫，陳潤永，候補監事童深道一，李公惕，丁山桂。</p>

<h3>確信日軍必獲勝利</h3>
<p>此次戰役敵美損害之重大，無徒待　百，即羅斯福自身亦不得不在議會及會見記者時，表示悲觀。其後且發表海軍擴張計劃採取苦肉計，此均為美軍遭受大損害時之當套手段。美艦隊目前雖經補給多數船舶，然對於體員戰意之低下，竟無法防止，其不利情勢唯見日益增大。反之，我國之戰略態勢，則因有多數重要島嶼散在各處，對於些少之空襲，絕不致遭受任何　害。反之，敵方之戰艦及航空母艦，較之此項陸上基地益顯示其贏弱性，我日本國民，在現代決戰期間，一致冷靜沈着，為前綫將士之後盾，不論如何雖關，均具有突破信心，此外中國並其他大東亞民族亦一致精誠團結，確信日本必可獲得絕對勝利，並積極予以協力。吾人豫知敵方之各種虛構宣傳，今後必將益趨活躍，然此對於中日二國以及大東亞民族反益可鼓舞旺盛之士氣，而有助於最後勝利之獲得。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　我控訴</h3>
<p>— 蔣壽同</p>
<p>關於敎師學生和學費問題</p>
<p>誰都知道社　國家民族是一個綿延不斷的有機體，這有機體的細胞是具有新陳代謝的作用：跟着舊的不適應的細胞的死亡，新的健全的細胞塡補上來了。但怎樣才能從死亡的墳墓上奠定新生的基磯呢？這便需要敎靑的扶養和培植，批判和改革。</p>
<p>而這也正是敎育下一代工作的問題。</p>
<p>尤其是中國，這近百年來始終在異壓迫下喘息着的中國，敎育下一代的工作是迫不及待的。但處在這戰亂倥傯的大時代，誰都會知道，敎育是旣不切實的需要，更不能收獲直接的戰十鬥效果的，所以敎育問題不容易引起各方面的注意，更不容易由注意而設法加以澈底的解決。這話就是說，到了戰爭爆發以後的今天，一般人都把精力集中在其他的問題上，對於敎育都抱着漠視有態度，其實譴忘了教育的重要性，可以使教育的有機體停止新生的作用。而時至現在，位居教育問題中首度的教職員生活問題便也　重地產生了。關於這，申報會提出屢次的討論，並經各方表示意見，歸納起來有以下三種主張：　由當局按月撥發敎職員津貼　。　由學生家長依照甲乙丙三級自動向學校　認捐。　增加學費。關於第一種主張，過去數月來的成績並不盡如理想，所以顯然是失敗的。關於第二種主張，已經實行，但並不普遍，且杯水草薪，無補實際，反之，由於用「捐助」和「救濟」來援助敎師，則尊敬敎師的心理，幾隨着一掃而空。因此到了最近，從谷校當局的計劃裏，我們己經聽到一片的「增加學費」聲。有人主張學費以八月。日的米價計算，即小學三斗至四斗，中學五斗至六斗，大學八斗至九斗。更有人主張把學生家長自動捐認的措施同時實行。</p>
<p>其實，這不是建設敎育，而是摧殘了敎育。</p>
<p>在這裏，我以　州育者的一份子提起控訴！</p>
<p>是的，前些時候我曾經和着千敎育家發起組織過敎職員消費合作社，一切的手縱已經進行得相當完備，然而屢經折衝，物炎的配給問題却是無法合理解決。奔走累月，結果不能圓滿成立。這也是以使熱心敎育人士為之寒心。然而用消費合作社的形式來解決敎職員的生活問題，我始終以為是最合理想，最治本的辦法。現在這樣的形式旣無從迅速實現，我們便順當退一步來從事補救。但「增加學費」決不是妥善的補救辦法。為什麼呢？‘這是因為第一，可以使淸寒學生失學。</p>
<p>第二，使報館的助學金募集運動更增加經濟不足的困難。</p>
<p>第三，對於腰繼萬千的富有者，倒並不曾為了經濟的優裕而多盡一些義務。</p>
<p>這裏尤其第一點最是嚴重，它使敎育成為富家子弟的專利品，使不能普及敎育的中國更陷於無從普及教育的境地。原來教育決不是單方面的，它同時包含著教者和被教者。有了被敎者而沒有敎者，固然無從接受敎育，有了教者而無被敎者，更是無從發揮敎育。所以對於那些只知其一不知其二的「增加學費」論者，我要控訴！</p>
<p>是的，我要控訴，但同時我也要呈獻出我的愚忱，我主張：敎職員的待遇應當增加，然而學生們的學費也應當减少。</p>
<p>在這樣的前提下，我要提出娛樂捐和消費特稅衷「晳加敎育捐」的徵收</p>
<p>辦法是這樣的：凡烟·酒·咖啡館·菜館·影院·劇塲·舞應，以及一切娛樂和消費塲所，在平時徵收捐費以外，再加上百分之幾的敎育捐。至於百分之「幾」，應由專家精密預算，預算的標準是：能使小學敎職員月薪增至一萬五千元，初中敎職員二萬元，高中敎職員二萬五千元，大學敎職員三萬元。俾得各安其職，努力辦學。（細則另議）</p>
<p>這絕不是單純的理想而已，如果關係當局　能力謀敎育發展，如果社會人士眞能體恤中國敎育，則我深切希望以上的提　能够護得共嗚，批判，改善和實現。</p>
<p>敎育是為了每一個人的，也是屬於每一個人的，我以敎育者的一份子，不敢藏拙，更不甘緘默，謹提出了我的控訴，並訊述了我的希望。</p>
<h3>海軍畫家（九）海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>「怎麼樣？或許太狹仄，不舒服吧！」</p>
<p>隆夫先跑進　子，捻開　燈，這樣說。眞人一而笑着，一而在航　的席上毫不）住乎地盤　坐下說；</p>
<p>「這是不能使我無驚的。驅逐艦上，甚至艦長室也不過如此。呵，有很多畫。全是你盡的麼？」</p>
<p>「全是我的練習作品。希望眞人看的畫，是有一張的，可惜今天拿到先生家去了。」</p>
<p>「我固然不大懂得　，但我覺着全是很好的畫。你在什麼地方畫的這張潛水艇　？」</p>
<p>「當然是在這間屋子裏畫的。看到過軍盤簿中伊號艦，而按想像便　出航駛中的潛水艇。無論怎樣說，按想像是不大妥當的。」</p>
<p>「也不一定。實際上就是這樣。你的筆法眞夠好了。」</p>
<p>眞人高與得眉飛色舞。在隆夫的心裏認為眞人是海軍軍人，且是唯一的知己，這種褒獎是比任何人都有力量的。</p>
<p>「謝謝你。我想拼命努力，不要輸給你。」</p>
<p>後來話題轉到海軍上去。兵學校，遠洋航海，少尉候補生等等事情，一件一件地說下去，眞是沒有頭。隆夫像痴呆了一樣，一字一句也都好好地聽。</p>
<p>「由候補生進昇少尉的時候，該是高興的吧！」</p>
<p>「那自然　！」</p>
<p>眞人莞爾而笑着，就開始說當時的情况。</p>
<p>從候補生進昇少尉，不僅是袖章結粗大了，也不僅是衣邊長了，而且這個時候，已經不再是羽毛不滿的小島，而　已成為　當一面的士官了，所以一切都不同了。例如出席突會喝酒，候補生則得不到正式許可，而少尉就可以自由喝。在水交社，也可以大搖大擺地出人。海軍暗語也可以左右逢源地使用。留頭髪，也是隨自巳便的。當了少尉，就是以前稱作商人服，而現在稱作便服的西裝，也都可以隨便穿。</p>
<p>「我一晋昇了官，就作了這套西裝。在橫須賀的水交社裏，山城區西服店是招攬生意的。」</p>
<p>「但穿着少尉的軍服走起路來，豈不是更加愉快麼？」</p>
<p>「也不會是那樣。如穿着便服，則水兵就不必走過和敬禮了，所以用不着注意他們就可以的。」</p>
<p>眞人在面孔上透　出絲絲的溫柔的微笑。雖然穿着西裝，但海軍少尉的神笑與希望，從他的　綫着的眼睛裏，可以表現出來。（一〇八）</p>

<h3>Editorial — Answering Readers' Questions</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Mariana Islands Naval Battle</p>
<p>Question: The recent battle off Saipan Island in the Mariana Islands in the central Pacific has drawn worldwide attention and is called the prelude to the great Pacific decisive battle. What is its actual significance?</p>
<p>Answer: This battle in the Mariana Islands is an unprecedented large-scale campaign in terms of size, number of troops mobilized, and the intensity of the enemy's ambitions since the beginning of the war. Considering the strategic situation of the US's attempt to capture Saipan, the island is 2,400 kilometers south of Tokyo and has long been the center of Japanese naval operations. Tokyo, Yokohama, and Osaka to the north, Oshima Island and most of the Marshall Islands to the east, important islands from the Bismarck Archipelago to New Guinea to the south, and southern Kyushu and most of the Ryukyu Islands to the west are all within a 1,000-mile radius of the island. Therefore, the island is actually the central area for defending the entire Greater East Asia region. This battle in this area has great significance for the entire East Asian war situation.</p>
<p>Question: From this perspective, the enemy venturing deep into Japan's largest defense center to take action is a most foolish adventure. Why would the enemy take such a great risk so foolishly at a time when the European invasion operations have just begun?</p>
<p>Answer: The enemy's motive for this adventure can be analyzed from both political and military strategies. Strategy follows politics, so let's look at the political aspect first. Regarding the East Asian operations, the US and British authorities have made extremely rash statements in the past, resulting in repeated failures of the US and British military, and the public's faith in the government has greatly diminished. Now, in order to maintain its domestic and international credibility and to show that the United States is capable of fighting on both the East and West fronts simultaneously, it has to take a reckless gamble. Secondly, the Japanese army has recently launched a large-scale offensive on the mainland, and the Chongqing army has suffered disastrous defeats in Henan and Hunan, and is on the verge of collapse. US Vice President Wallace, who bears a special mission, arrived in Chongqing at this time, which is truly a situation for both laughter and tears. The US leaders are therefore more willing to take risks in order to boost the morale of Chongqing and ease domestic criticism.</p>
<p>Question: What is the strategic intent?</p>
<p>Answer: The political aspect is completely passive, and in essence, it is just a reckless gamble. Therefore, there are many errors in the strategic aspect as well. First, the enemy has long held a fear of the Japanese navy, but mistakenly believes that the Japanese navy only knows how to defend the homeland; and mistakenly believes that the Japanese navy can be lured out and annihilated; hence this adventure. Second, because the "island hopping" strategy has been completely defeated by the Japanese army in the past two years, they are thinking of changing their approach, willing to make greater sacrifices to attack the base closest to the Japanese mainland, in order to reverse the entire East Asian war situation.</p>
<p>Question: The enemy's political and military strategies are so out of touch with reality, no wonder they have suffered severe blows. Can you tell us about the progress of the Saipan Island operation?</p>
<p>Answer: On the morning of June 15th, the enemy army approaching the Mariana Islands attempted to land on Saipan Island twice, but was repelled on the sea. By the afternoon, after seizing a corner of the island, they gradually increased their forces, but were ambushed by the Japanese garrison and suffered heavy losses. At the same time, the enemy appearing near the Mariana Islands was a large mobile unit mainly composed of aircraft carriers and battleships, and most of the Pacific Fleet was concentrated in that area. The Japanese air force actively launched attacks. By June 19th, part of the Japanese Combined Fleet surrounded the enemy mobile unit in the waters west of the Mariana Islands, and by the 20th, it had sunk and destroyed five enemy aircraft carriers and more than one battleship. On the 23rd, the Japanese air force became more active, sinking and destroying four enemy battleships, more than eleven aircraft carriers, and six cruisers one after another. By this point, the enemy fleet had no choice but to retreat.</p>
<p>Question: I heard that the enemy dispatched eighty percent of its fleet this time, showing great determination and ambition in its operations. Why was it so easily defeated?</p>
<p>Answer: I have already said that this time, the enemy's operation against the Mariana Islands was full of adventurous psychology, but their political and military strategies were without any basis, so their failure is not surprising. From a political point of view, the United States is actually trying to restore colonial slave rule, which is well known to all ethnic groups in East Asia. Secondly, from a strategic point of view, as former Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, Admiral Suetsugu said: "In the past, fleets that ventured out far from the motherland's fortress have always brought about their own destruction." "Looking at the historical examples of the Yuan dynasty's invasion, the Baltic Fleet during the Russo-Japanese War, the Spanish Armada, and the Battle of Sarannis, although relying on material strength, there has never been a case of good fortune when operating far away." Now the enemy is still 3,300 nautical miles away from its supply line, Pearl Harbor, while Japan is as close as the doorstep. The Japanese army is well-rested, waiting for work, and the navy, army, and air force are cooperating, ready to give the enemy a severe blow at any time. Therefore, the victor and loser have already been determined.</p>
<p>Question: So what is the trend of the Mariana Islands operation?</p>
<p>Answer: According to our observation, although the enemy's attack on Saipan Island this time has great ambition, the purpose may be to lure out the Japanese main fleet. However, when part of the Japanese main fleet arrived, it first used the air force to bomb the US fleet, inflicting heavy damage, and finally forced it to retreat. Colonel Kurihara, head of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, said it well: "The damage inflicted on the enemy this time is already quite significant, but compared to the enemy's forces that invaded this time, it is only a part, and it cannot determine the battle situation. Therefore, in the future, in that area, we must thoroughly eliminate the invading enemy with the full force of the navy, army, and air force." We, standing in the position of one of the allied nations in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation, must redouble our efforts to assist our allies, prepare for the final decisive battle, and welcome the final victory. I can borrow the words of General Suetsugu Nobumasa to offer to the people of the country:</p>
<p>"Every moment from now on is precious time for Japanese soldiers to kill the enemy. May you all calmly await the good news!"</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Aslito Airfield; Air Raids on Islands Around Saipan Intensify</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in the Saipan Island area, cooperating with ground troops, also launched a night raid on the Aslito Airfield in the southern part of the island on the 26th, bombing it fiercely, destroying it and setting it on fire. The Japanese side suffered no damage. On the same day, Japanese aircraft also bombed the enemy supply accumulation point south of Garapan in the western part of the island, hitting many bombs, causing explosions and a major fire. The Japanese army safely returned to its defense amid triumphant cheers.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Air raids by the US Air Force on islands around Saipan Island have become increasingly intense, especially on Pagan Island. On the 27th, a total of sixty to one hundred carrier-based fighters attacked the island, but the Japanese garrison immediately repelled the enemy aircraft. In addition, another sixty enemy aircraft attacked Rota, and were repelled after being met by the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Torrential Rains in Longchuan and Shijiang, Yunnan; A Major Battle on the Plains is About to Unfold; Supply Difficulties for Chongqing by Land and Air</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army base on the Nu River Front, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the Yunnan Expeditionary Force crossed the Nu River and invaded the Longling and Tengchong areas of Japanese-occupied Yunnan, it is suffering due to the rear supply lines being hampered by bad weather. The main force of several divisions of the Chongqing 20th Army Group, which crossed the river upstream of the Nu River, is now moving south from Longchuan and Shijiang. The Japanese army is also gathering new elite troops, preparing to inflict a major blow on the Chongqing army on the muddy Yunnan plains during the torrential rains. According to prisoners, Chongqing launched only two fierce counterattacks before being defeated. The 21st Regiment recently called for a third counterattack, and a division of reinforcements was transferred, but these were mostly wounded soldiers who had been reorganized. Since the start of the Nu River operation, as of June 23rd, it has been confirmed that Chongqing troops left behind a total of over 1,450 corpses, and more than 20,000 were killed, wounded, or captured. Chongqing's second intensive offensive against the Nu River front was completely ineffective.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 28th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces in northern Burma previously drove the combined Chongqing-US forces to invade the Hukawng Valley area, attempting to open a route to invade Tonkin (Vietnam), but after attacks by the Japanese army, they have suffered heavy losses after half a year of fighting. Their attempt to recapture Burma is unlikely to be realized with the arrival of the rainy season. Therefore, in his anxiety, Stilwell ordered the Chongqing army airborne troops stationed in India, who had undergone a short period of training, to parachute into Myitkyina, a key point in northern Burma, in an attempt to seize the area. However, due to continuous attacks by the Japanese army, lack of air supply, and the prevalence of infectious diseases, these airborne troops have lost their will to fight, and recent surrenders have been numerous. The airborne troops are now in a state of disintegration and collapse in the dense forests of northern Burma. As of the 23rd, Chongqing airborne troops had left behind more than 4,500 corpses. If the officers, wounded, prisoners, and surrendering soldiers are included, the losses of the Chongqing army actually exceed 10,000. Currently, various units of the Japanese army are launching surprise encirclement operations everywhere to wipe out the defeated and remnant Chongqing forces. Due to the arrival of the rainy season in northern Burma, Chongqing's supply is difficult by both land and air. In terms of supply, the US army has priority, while most Chongqing troops can only eat the leftovers of the US army. On the 24th of this month, eight Chongqing soldiers surrendered to the Japanese army, claiming that the American soldiers were treacherous, eating meat and drinking milk themselves and hiding alcohol in their clothes, while giving Chongqing soldiers only a section of sugarcane every day, without caring. They also said that if Indian soldiers wanted to smoke, they had to clean the rust from the American soldiers' iron equipment. The American soldiers' inhumane behavior was often seen on the battlefield. They only received three or four months of military training in their own country. They had very little courage, and dared not travel alone in the dense forest. When moving at night, they often placed Chongqing troops in the front. When Chongqing soldiers contracted diseases or typhoid fever, American doctors would not treat them, but let them recover naturally. Therefore, the Chongqing army airborne troops stationed in India only know that resistance is hopeless, and their hatred of the American army is growing day by day. The entire Chongqing army is on the path to surrender or destruction within the Japanese encirclement.</p>
<h3>Japan's Ideological Decisive Battle Association Officially Established Yesterday; Regular Meetings to be Held on the 18th of Each Month</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ideological Decisive Battle Committee decided to appoint former Ambassador to Italy and current member of the House of Representatives, Shiratori Toshio, as chairman. The establishment ceremony was held at the Kaikan at 2:00 PM on the 27th. Chairman Shiratori and more than a dozen key members attended, and it was decided that the committee's objectives would be to: 1. Promote the Imperial Way. 2. Thoroughly instill the idea of sharing destiny with allied nations. 3. Research poisonous and evil ideas. 4. Expose enemy strategies and propaganda. 5. Study financial and economic policies. 6. Conduct concrete research on a new world order. The committee then discussed each issue in detail and adjourned at 5:00 PM. The committee will hold regular meetings on the 18th of each month and will provide the authorities with the drafts it has decided on at any time.</p>
<h3>Information Officer Yokoyama Gave a Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Yokoyama, Information Officer of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with Chinese reporters stationed in Japan on the afternoon of the 28th and gave a speech on US Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing and British Production Minister Lyttelton's slip of the tongue: "US Vice President Wallace's visit to Chongqing has resulted in a joint statement with Chiang Kai-shek. What we find most noteworthy and interesting in the statement is the granting of autonomy to Asian nations within a certain period of time. However, since the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration last year and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, Asian nations such as Burma, the Philippines, and India have already become independent one after another. Therefore, what they are declaring, we have already implemented. The United States is using China as its military base, which is the reason for Wallace's visit to Chongqing. However, whether their plan to use China as their military base can succeed or not can be clearly seen from the battles in Henan and Hunan. Regarding British Production Minister Lyttelton's slip of the tongue that the United States provoked the current Japanese-American war, it is not just Lyttelton alone, but also 30 people within the United States who have been charged with treason, because they all said, 'Japan is by no means the provoker of this war; in other words, it is actually the United States.' The above-mentioned 30 people have now been sentenced to ten years in prison or a fine of 100,000 dollars."</p>

<p>Saigon, 28th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Yoshizawa visited Governor Decoux in Dalat on the 20th, returned to Saigon on the 25th, and met with the Japanese press corps at his official residence on the evening of the 26th, delivering a speech: "When the US and British landed in Europe, I was in Hanoi. At that time, I received an official letter from Governor Decoux hoping to meet as soon as possible, so I rushed to Dalat ahead of schedule. The meeting went smoothly. Governor Decoux repeatedly stated that no matter what happens in his country, the local area will never change its policy of cooperating with Japan. At this stage in Vietnam's support for the Petain government, the Empire's policy towards Vietnam will also absolutely not change. On this point, my opinion and Governor Decoux's opinion are completely consistent. The US and British plots against Vietnam are about to become increasingly fierce, and I have requested the Vietnamese authorities to actively seek countermeasures. Governor Decoux has issued orders to all parties to instruct methods. The French people in the area are not without concerns about the recent situation in their own country, but France itself now seems to be very calm. The situation of the Vietnamese authorities is also extremely calm."</p>
<h3>High-Grade Aviation Fuel Does Not Produce Deadly Poison; Invention by Dr. Akatsuka of Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Akatsuka Kyoji, a technician at the Research Institute of the Japanese Ministry of Military Affairs, has made significant contributions to the mass production of high-grade aviation fuel. The Director of the Naval Ministry's Ordnance Bureau awarded the doctor a letter of commendation. The commendation ceremony was held in the Director's office on the afternoon of the 27th, with relevant officials in attendance. Dr. Akatsuka has succeeded in making high-grade aviation fuel, which had previously relied on foreign countries, domestically produced. The most difficult issue was the production of deadly poison during the production process. To this end, he continued to research scientific prevention measures in his spare time, and finally established a successful anti-poisoning measure. As a result, Japan's high-performance aviation fuel, which is praised around the world, has seen a large increase in production due to the perfection of anti-poisoning facilities. All production soldiers have been able to devote themselves to production work with peace of mind, free from tragic occupational diseases. Dr. Akatsuka stated in Fukushima Prefecture: "The content and method of research is not to inject or administer drugs to the poisoned workers, but to fundamentally improve the overall factory facilities, such as preventing the deadly poison produced in the work process from coming into contact with the workers who work hard, and ventilating and replacing air to immediately disperse the deadly poison, and absorb it with ultraviolet rays, so as to prevent the occurrence of poisoned patients. I am confident that this type of facility in our country can be praised around the world. I am very pleased that not only has the goal of increased production been achieved, but also that the workers are not being poisoned."</p>
<h3>Gandhi Continues Anti-British Struggle</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Relations between the Indian government and the Gandhians have recently deteriorated due to the government's provocative attitude. The Gandhians seem to have adopted a resolute attitude, and are continuing their anti-British struggle without fear of arrest by the British Indian authorities. According to a Reuters dispatch from Poona, the Gandhians resolutely demanded on the 26th that Governor-General Wavell meet with them to review the current situation, but it remains to be seen what measures Wavell will take in response to this request from the Gandhians.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Personnel Affairs Changes Review Methods</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since the Ministry of Personnel Affairs of the National Government began handling the review of civil service appointments in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China, it has made changes to the procedures in consideration of civil servants who were collecting documents after the Incident. The Ministry issued a list of required supplementary documents and notified the original reviewing agency to forward them for supplementation, so that they could be qualified in accordance with the law and be remedied. However, since the implementation, there have been cases where the documents were delayed for several months, or even overdue and not supplemented, which is contrary to the original intention and expected effect of the Ministry. It is now learned that in order to thoroughly clear up the backlog of cases that have been handled but not completed, the Ministry has sent separate letters to the original reviewing agencies, strictly urging them to complete the supplementation within a limited time. In the future, when central and local agencies submit civil servants for review, they must submit all documents together with the application form. If the documents are incomplete, even if the information filled in on the form is consistent, no further notice will be given, and the original documents will be reviewed in accordance with the law to quickly determine whether they are qualified or unqualified. Those who are unqualified may apply for a review within one month of the receipt of the notification, in accordance with Article 16 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Civil Service Appointment Law, limited to one time.</p>

<h3>Commander-in-Chief Hata Inspects Japanese Air Force Frontline Base; Reviews Various Fighter Squadrons and Commends Them</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army base, 28th (Central News Agency) - Since occupying Hengyang, the Japanese army has continued to advance and is now approaching the outskirts of Hengyang. The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing military forces will be completely eliminated, all thanks to the cooperation of the Japanese army's air and ground forces. General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, arrived at a certain base on the 26th, braving the heat, in order to commend the Japanese Air Force units that are covering the friendly forces' advance, bombing US Air Force bases in Chongqing, and thoroughly destroying the enemy's combat power. He first listened to a report on the new fighter aircraft, and then reviewed several team members, from officers to privates, of various fighter squadrons. After the review, he gave a speech, mainly saying: "All the brilliant achievements on the mainland battlefield are due to your struggles. However, the war situation is becoming more urgent, and I hope that you will make further efforts in the future." These words gave all the members great inspiration, and their heroic posture was written on their faces. Commander-in-Chief Hata then left the base amid enthusiastic farewells.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, previously inspected the front lines in Hunan and gave guidance on operations. Now, on the 26th, he inspected the frontline base of the Japanese air force squadron on the same front and gave instructions on operational matters. Due to the progress of the Hunan operations, the activities of the US Air Force in Chongqing are becoming increasingly active. The Japanese air force squadron in the area is now actively engaging in air combat to eliminate this US Air Force and is increasingly determined to fight. The results of the battle are now expanding. Regarding this point, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China issued a proclamation at 1:00 PM on the 28th, stating that General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, inspected a certain frontline base of the Japanese air force squadron on the 26th and gave instructions on operational matters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Suddenly Enter Hengyang; Chongqing Faces Major Threat; Statement by Press Chief Izumi</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The press department of the Imperial Japanese Army in Shanghai held a routine meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 28th) at a Chinese restaurant on the Bund in Nanjing Road.  Press Chief Izumi spoke on the rapid progress of the Japanese army in the recent operations in southern Hunan, having broken into Hengyang, the expanded base of the enemy's American air force in Chongqing. He also discussed the military significance of occupying Luoyang and Changsha, which greatly caused Chongqing to lose its protective screen and suffer a severe blow, urging Chongqing to quickly realize the situation. Finally, he deemed the Allied invasion of Europe and the American military actions in the Pacific as unworthy of attention and not progressing as ideally as they had hoped. A record of his statement follows:</p>
<p>Significant Impact: Minister Izumi began by saying that according to news from the front lines regarding the situation in Hunan, on the morning of the 24th of this month, the Japanese army swiftly broke into the Hengyang airfield. The Chongqing troops defending the area, numbering about two divisions, were engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. He believed that the situation could be resolved in a short period. Hengyang is the largest forward base for the American air force in Chongqing, and since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing and the United States have desperately engaged in the construction of various bases in Hengyang. Furthermore, the name Hengyang has recently gained considerable international prominence. Therefore, the Japanese army is determined to launch an offensive on this crucial point, causing no small military and psychological impact on Chongqing. The significance of the Japanese army's attack on Hengyang lies not only in dealing a deadly blow to the enemy and achieving important military gains but also in gaining control of the Pinghan-Yuehan railway lines after occupying Hengyang. Thus, Hengyang will become the center for securing these communication lines (including railways, highways, and waterways), exerting pressure on the provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Today, the Japanese army has already achieved considerable success in the central part of the Chinese mainland, having broken into Hengyang, occupied Luoyang in northern Henan, and Changsha in Hunan. This means that Japan has deeply penetrated the important protective screen of Chongqing, further threatening the eastern provinces of the Chinese mainland, such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, and Guangdong. Foreign journalists stationed in Chongqing have repeatedly reported that the fall of Hengyang is more serious than that of Changsha in military and economic terms, urging rapid reflection. In the context of the anti-Axis alliance, this has created a state of anxiety and embarrassment, with deep fears that Chongqing may break away from the anti-Axis camp. Therefore, serious consideration is being given to reversing this declining trend. Furthermore, the United States is particularly impatient. The fact of Chongqing's military failure has completely shattered the plans of Admiral Nimitz, commander of the US Pacific Fleet. Nimitz advocated using the Chinese mainland to attack mainland Japan, but Chongqing's military failure has led to the collapse of his plan. At the same time, the island-hopping strategy advocated by General MacArthur, commander of the US forces in the Southwest Pacific, has also been severely threatened from the side, making it difficult for their plans to be realized in the short term. As a result, major disagreements may arise in the American war effort in the Pacific. The weak performance of the American air force in Chongqing has further caused them anxiety and unease. Moreover, the Chongqing regime's corruption, reliance on foreign forces, and use of concealment to cover up its own failures, combined with its excessive expectations for the US Navy's battle in Saipan, while underestimating the Japanese army's operations on the mainland, reveal a self-satisfied and self-destructive attitude that will ultimately lead to its own downfall. Therefore, caring about the anti-Axis invasion of Europe and the progress of the American forces in the Pacific while forgetting the loss of important strongholds and placing the serious threat aside, entrusting all life and property to others, is foolish and deeply regrettable.  The delusion that they can join the ranks of the victorious nations as long as Britain and the United States win should be deeply reflected upon as soon as possible. The anti-Axis invasion of Europe and the American military actions in the Pacific will certainly not achieve the ideal progress they envision.</p>
<h3>China Railway Decides to Assist in Grain Transportation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) To alleviate the food shortage in Nanjing and Shanghai, the authorities have formulated temporary measures for food grains in the two cities and instructed the China Railway to provide convenience. However, progress has not been satisfactory so far. This reporter interviewed the relevant authorities, who stated that the China Railway, being under military administration during wartime, prioritizes military transport, and civil transport inevitably takes a secondary role. The general public should understand the difficulties of the times. However, the authorities will provide convenience within possible limits to assist the authorities and effectively suppress the rising rice prices.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Hengyang</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) According to Chongqing Central Broadcasting, the Japanese army is advancing southward on the east and west sides of the Yuehan Railway, converging east of Hengyang. Then, they divided their forces into two routes, one attacking the northeast corner of Hengyang, and the other attacking the Hengyang airfield. Intense fighting is currently taking place near Hengyang.</p>
<h3>North China Establishes Second Directly-Administered Administrative Region</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) Zhang Zhongzhi, Vice Minister of General Affairs of the North China Political Affairs Commission, met with a group of Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Foreign Affairs Building on the morning of the 27th to discuss the establishment of the second directly-administered administrative region. He stated as follows: Since the designation of Yongqing, Gu'an, Anci, and Daxing counties as the first directly-administered administrative region in late November last year, the reconstruction has been exceptionally successful. The authorities, encouraged by this, have further designated the ten counties and one city of the entire Jidong Circuit as the second directly-administered administrative region, which is broader in scope than the first region and has special political significance. This is an important area of Hebei Province, bordering Manchuria. The important industrial areas include the Kailuan coal mines, and the industrial center of Tangshan. The characteristic of the directly-administered region lies in concentrating the overall strength of the military, government, officials, and people to promote administrative implementation. In particular, the communist bandits are deeply rooted, making it necessary to concentrate the overall strength to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Prices in Beiping Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>Beiping, 28th (Central News Agency) Prices in Beiping rose sharply in early spring but have gradually declined since late March. Recently, daily necessities such as cotton textiles, rice, firewood, soap, cigarettes, and cooking oil have plummeted in price, much to the delight of the general public. The price decrease is attributed to the change in rice distribution to ten kilograms per person per month, and the crackdown on merchants hoarding goods, which has been effective. The confiscated hoarded goods are distributed to citizens at publicly determined prices. As a result, the price of millet in May fell by nine-tenths compared to February, and the price of corn fell by 17%, indicating that prices are becoming more stable. German Artillery Effectively Bombards Enemy Deployment Lines</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: Fierce fighting continued throughout the 26th in the Tilly area. Although the British suffered heavy casualties, they continued to press south between Hottot and Norrey, but all attacks near Hottot were defeated. The Canadian 3rd Infantry Division and the British 3rd Infantry Division on both sides of Tilly suffered serious losses in the battle. Enemy engineers attacked German fortresses with flamethrowers and were subjected to heavy artillery fire, and some of the engineers were killed when their flamethrowers were hit. No major battles occurred along the Caen to Vigny line. The movements of the large-scale enemy deployment were effectively disrupted by German artillery fire, revealing their offensive plans in the area. At the same time, the US Eighth Army, which recently landed at the bridgehead, is fighting in the southern part of the Cotentin Peninsula. Since Sunday, the artillery fire has become increasingly intense. Although a general offensive has not yet been launched, German artillery fire has been effective in bombarding the enemy's entry points and deployment lines. London announced last night that Major General Saunders, commander of the Allied Marine Corps, had been killed in action on the Normandy front. German authorities announced that within the city of Cherbourg...</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Central News Agency) Reuter's reports from London: Allied military authorities have mobilized the best British and American engineers and salvage ship workers in an attempt to restore the destroyed docks of Cherbourg. Reuter's military correspondent Setorius is deeply concerned with the sea and air power of the Allies, which can now be transferred to other military operations. Whether the enemy will take large-scale landing operations at other locations along the Atlantic coast or temporarily use the Normandy bridgehead as an offensive base depends on future developments. The latter requires replenishing its landing forces in Cotentin and Calvados and expanding the Calvados bridgehead to the south before launching large-scale offensives eastward and southward. However, it is also possible for the enemy to carry out large-scale landings elsewhere to serve as the main force for the invasion of Europe. The German command has been preparing for this, and the German army's ability to maintain its strength during three weeks of invasion operations is evidence of the military authorities' effective response.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch Pincer Movement, Reaching Minsk Area; German Forces Break Through Encirclement in Orsha</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report: The Soviet forces' large-scale summer offensive in the central sector clearly aims to conduct a large-scale encirclement under the cover of tanks and mechanized units. The enemy's units attacking the German positions in Bobruisk and increasing pressure on Bobruisk from the Vitebsk area have forced the German defense line there to retreat from several strongpoints. The enemy's repeated attempts to break through towards Bobruisk have been blocked south of the town, causing heavy enemy casualties. The German forward positions in Mogilev have also had to retreat to the edge of the town, and the German forces in the surrounding areas are also retreating to the Dnieper River line.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency Report, military source: Vitebsk in the central sector of the Eastern Front...</p>
<p>(Wuhan News) The Japanese army has been operating in the Henan and Hunan regions for several months. The operations have been proceeding smoothly, with the successive fall of Chongqing's important strongholds such as Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Changsha. The war is still ongoing. Recently, a Japanese war correspondent returned from the front lines due to some business. The press reporting unit here invited the correspondent and reporters from Chinese news agencies and newspapers to a symposium on June 24. The war correspondent spoke about how the Japanese army sympathizes with the general public of China, which is admirable. The minutes of the symposium are recorded below: War Correspondents: Hideo Umino (Special Correspondent for Yomiuri Shimbun), Kiyomi Qinzeji (Deputy Councilor of Domei News Agency), Usuke Oshima (Chief of the Hankou Branch of Asahi Shimbun); Press Reporting Unit: A Senior Military Officer; Chinese Reporters: Reporters from Da Chu Pao, Wuhan Pao, Shen Pao, and Central Telegraph Agency. Press Reporting Unit Member: Thank you very much for your presence today. First, I would like to ask Mr. Umino to explain the situation in Henan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Commits No Offenses</h3>
<p>Umino: I have been serving in North China for two months. This time, I followed the Pinghan Railway south. I remember that in the past, when the Japanese army occupied a city or village, the residents would flee to the surrounding countryside and would not return to their original homes for several months. But this time, the situation is very different. No matter which city or village, within two or three days after the Japanese army moved in, many residents returned one after another. Young women were also walking on the streets without fear. What is the reason for this? Because the Japanese soldiers treat every Chinese civilian with love and care, so that the Chinese people feel that the Japanese soldiers are not their enemies. I can give a few examples. Originally, when the army moved into any place, it would usually borrow civilian houses as temporary dormitories. This time, the entire army stayed outdoors, and not a single soldier entered a Chinese civilian's house to disturb them. Not only a single soldier, even the highest-ranking commanders spent the night in tents on the road, even on rainy and muddy nights. There was one incident. In the rural areas of Henan, the wheat is now ripe, and the farmers are looking forward to the harvest. When the Japanese army passed through the rural areas, there were landmines buried by the Chongqing army everywhere on the road, which was very dangerous. So if they walked through the wheat fields, it would be the safest. However, they could not bear to destroy the hard work of the Chinese farmers, so they still walked on the retreat routes, knowing that there were dangerous objects there. Once, because I was short of food, I saw many ripe cucumbers in a vegetable garden and wanted to pick them to fill my stomach. Just as I was about to step into the garden, I was suddenly stopped by a military officer. If a unit's headquarters needed tables and chairs, they would want to borrow them from civilian houses temporarily. However, because the residents had all fled, they could not ask for permission and had to take them. But when the unit was ordered to depart, all the borrowed furniture was returned to its original place, and not a single item was lost. The above-mentioned situation is unprecedented in past operations. It is easy to imagine how disciplined the Japanese army is this time. After Zhengzhou fell, the Japanese army entered the city in a very orderly manner. So in just a few days, the residents came back one after another. A week later, the public security maintenance committee was established. Ten days later, the city was completely restored to its original state. In other places, it took no more than a month at the latest for the city to return to its former state.</p>
<p>Nishijima: Mr. Umino has explained very clearly how well the Japanese army in Henan treats the Chinese people. Now, please ask Mr. Qinzeji to explain the situation of the Japanese army in the Hunan area.</p>
<h3>Residents Return One After Another</h3>
<p>Qinzeji: I also served in the Hunan area. I also saw the same things as Mr. Umino said. When we arrived at any village that the Japanese army's vanguard had passed through two or three days before, the roads, rice paddies, and houses were not damaged at all. Farmers were drying their washed clothes in front of their homes, and there were also cattle, pigs, sheep, and other livestock. Seeing this scene, one could hardly imagine that a large number of troops carrying weapons had stayed here two or three days ago. This is all proof that the Japanese army cares about the lives of the Chinese people after they return home and has not touched a single blade of grass or a single tree. When I arrived at a village on Dongting Lake, I took a boat with a friend from the army to play around because I had some free time. I saw several Japanese soldiers on the shore grabbing a calf, tying its four feet, and trying to kill it. Just then, a military policeman walked by, saw this situation, and severely scolded them and released the calf. The Chinese farmers knew that the Japanese army was coming, so they had to flee. They watched the situation from a place seven or eight kilometers away from their villages. Later, they learned that the Japanese army did not harm the people, so they returned to the place where the Japanese army was stationed after three or four days, which shows how much they trust the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Nishijima: Now please ask Mr. Oshima to speak.</p>
<h3>Facts of Friendship</h3>
<p>Oshima: I am also a reporter who served in the Hunan region. The unit I served in was stationed in a certain place, and there was a village nearby. The soldiers took their food and other items to the village. I saw chickens, ducks, pigs, etc. I thought they had caught them to eat for dinner. Unexpectedly, those loving soldiers opened the cans and took out the contents to feed the chickens, ducks, etc. I thought that the Japanese soldiers loved the scenery of Hunan as much as they loved their hometowns. Once, the army was about to depart, and everyone was busy preparing. When they were about to depart, I saw a soldier in a Chinese civilian's house giving him medicine that he had brought with him. I asked him why. He told me that their family had been very kind to him and the other Japanese soldiers, making tea and sending fruit to express their condolences. Now that our unit is about to move forward, because I cannot speak Chinese, I took the medicine I brought with me and gave it to their mother. This is my way of thanking them. I think that in the anti-Japanese war zone, no one has ever taught the Chinese people to practice Sino-Japanese friendship, but if they treat each other with human love, then the facts of friendship will naturally occur.

<h3>Measures for Passage in Traffic Blockade Zones Announced; Announcement by Japanese Army and Navy Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Anti-Aircraft Command recently issued a notice amending the traffic control regulations at the time of the notice. From now on, when an alert is issued, all vehicles and pedestrians should stop for five minutes to avoid traffic chaos. In the past, the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, the Shanghai Garrison, and the Shanghai Military Police originally issued a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit." Holders of this permit were allowed to pass even after an alert was issued and during unexpected events when passage was prohibited. However, as of now, there seems to be a considerable number of holders of this permit, and the styles of the permits are also diverse. Therefore, to avoid causing confusion, the above three organizations have decided to unify the handling of this permit. All previously issued passage permits will be invalid from July 7. Anyone who truly needs to use this permit must reapply to the First or Second Police Bureau for issuance. The Marine Corps Garrison and the Military Police will strictly screen applicants and only issue permits to those deemed necessary. The above three organizations issued the following notice on the 29th:</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>The measures for passage in traffic blockade zones are stipulated as follows:</p>
<p>In traffic blockade zones after an alert is issued and when terrorist incidents occur, only the following personnel are allowed to pass:</p>
<p>A. Army and Navy military personnel and military affiliates, etc., wearing uniforms or holding identification cards.</p>
<p>B. Employees of consulates, police stations, the First and Second Police Bureaus, and the Jianghai Customs Port Police Bureau wearing uniforms.</p>
<p>C. Those holding a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit" issued by the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, the Shanghai Garrison, and the Shanghai Military Police.</p>
<p>For general residents to apply for a "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permit," they should fill out an application form, attach two photos, and submit it through the First or Second Police Bureau for application. After strict selection, permits will only be issued to those deemed necessary for air defense or security.</p>
<p>(Note) All previously issued "Traffic Blockade Zone Passage Permits" will be invalid from July 7 of this year.</p>
<h3>City's Banking Industry Holds General Membership Meeting Yesterday; Six Important Motions Passed, Re-election of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Banking Association, in accordance with the provisions of its charter, held its 15th general membership meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th). More than ten members attended. The meeting was chaired by Ye Fuxiao, Chairman of the Association, who delivered an opening speech. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the Association's affairs. The following were discussed and passed: Revision of the banking industry regulations; Approval of the Association's financial statements for the first half of this year and the budget for the second half; Approval of increasing the special fees for the second half of this year; Approval of adjusting the number of representatives per member; Approval of the Minyi Bank's application for membership; Approval of strengthening the internal organization of the Association, changing the secretariat into two departments: General Affairs and Auditing. The re-election of directors and supervisors for this term then took place, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Report on Association Affairs</h3>
<p>Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the Association's affairs, stating: It has been half a year since the 14th general membership meeting was held on December 29 last year. During this period, the Shanghai financial market did not see a relaxation of credit, and stock prices continued to fall. However, due to a slight decrease in speculative hoarding, general floating capital tended to normalize, so the financial situation as a whole was generally stable. In the past six months, the government has promulgated about twenty laws and regulations related to the financial industry, such as the "Provisional Measures for Restricting the Registration of Company Capital Increases," the "Deadline and Measures for Banks and Qianzhuang Organized as Companies in North China and Central China to Complete Supplementary Registration with the Ministry of Industry," the "Abolition of Restrictions on Remittances between North China and Central China," the "Issuance Measures for the First Series of Construction Public Bonds," the "Regulations on Food Grain Treasury Vouchers of Types A and B for the 32nd Year," the "Adjustment of the Currency System in the Huaihai Province," and the "Joint Exchange of United Reserve Certificates and Central Reserve Certificates." Among these, several are of utmost importance:</p>
<p>Prohibiting Banks from Purchasing and Hoarding Goods: The government has ordered the Association to thoroughly investigate and report violations for punishment. At the same time, the Economic Department of the First District Office of this city issued an order that the industry association should supervise the business operations of its members, and if there are violations or concealment, the person in charge of the association will be punished. In order to stabilize the social economy and maintain the financial market, in addition to distributing the order to all members, the Association specifically emphasized the importance of paying close attention to this matter, and all members should be able to deeply understand this purpose.</p>
<p>Implementation of the New Income Tax Rate: The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office implemented the new tax rate on March 1. It was learned that the business income tax of the first category A and B for the 32nd year was being collected. The Association believed that because the banks had already completed their year-end financial statements and had held shareholder meetings, and had already distributed the profits, retroactively collecting the tax would cause many difficulties. In terms of the tax rate, there were also some aspects that could be studied. Therefore, the Association and the Qianye Association jointly submitted a document requesting a one-year extension of the implementation, but because the case had been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, it was difficult to change, and the request could not be granted.</p>
<p>Prohibiting the Redemption of British and American Currencies: The buying and selling of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, etc., and remittances have been prohibited since July of the 31st year. However, in terms of foreign currency deposits and debts in banks, customers may not be very clear about this and may request to settle accounts by converting them into Central Reserve Certificates. The banks found it difficult to handle this. Therefore, the Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Later, it was approved that before foreign exchange trading is restored, the deposit and withdrawal of the above currencies are prohibited, and it is not allowed to settle accounts by converting them into Central Reserve Certificates. All banking associations in various places were also ordered to comply. Other reports on association affairs related to all members are omitted.</p>
<h3>Section Chief Matsushima Delivers Radio Address to Chongqing and Australia: "The Annihilation of the American Fleet is Increasingly Near"</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet in China, delivered a radio address to Chongqing and Australia from Shanghai at 10:10 PM on the 27th, titled "The Annihilation of the American Fleet is Increasingly Near." A summary of the main points is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Decisive Battle Momentum Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>Since the appearance of the enemy's American forces of a substantial mobile unit in the Mariana Islands on June 11, the Pacific war situation has become even more significant, and the momentum of the decisive battle is increasingly intense. The current situation is that the enemy forces, having sustained heavy damage in the two naval battles of June 19 and 20, have temporarily withdrawn from our army's attack range. However, to support the two divisions of troops that landed in Saipan, they are still lingering in the nearby waters, intending to support the land operations on Saipan Island and to cut off our army's supply lines, intermittently attacking Iwo Jima by air.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Repel the Attacking Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>Currently, the fierce battle between Japan and the United States on Saipan Island is intensifying daily, and it can be said to determine the future fate of the Greater East Asia War. To conceal their significant damage and operational disadvantages, the enemy, Britain and the United States, are single-mindedly engaging in false propaganda, and their methods are truly vicious and should be paid considerable attention. A general counter-offensive by Britain and the United States in the Pacific has long been anticipated, and Roosevelt has also claimed that it will be launched simultaneously with the invasion operations in Europe. However, regardless of the enemy's propaganda, our country's war power is only increasing daily. For example, at the graduation ceremony of the Army University on May 20, Chief of Staff Tojo instructed the students, stating that the war situation has reached a major turning point, and the elite troops of the Japanese army have adopted a decisive battle posture, preparing to repel the attacking enemy forces. Although the enemy has repeatedly engaged in large-scale propaganda since entering the Marshall Islands on January 30, they have only wasted time and made no progress. This is because they have learned that Truk and other important strongholds of our side are heavily defended, and the so-called central breakthrough in the Pacific is not easy. Since the enemy invaded Biak Island in New Guinea on May 27, the focus of the war has shifted to that area. However, the enemy has suffered strong resistance from our army in that area and has had to change its route.</p>
<h3>Political Drama, Utterly Tedious</h3>
<p>The Anglo-American European invasion operation officially commenced on June 6th. However, facing the strong German army, they were completely helpless and suffered great losses. To salvage their credibility among the anti-Axis nations and neutral countries, Britain and America were eager to change the situation. In desperation, they decided to have the U.S. military attack the Mariana Islands. In other words, the U.S. military's attack on the Mariana Islands was not driven by the intrinsic mission of war, but purely a political drama to rescue the stalemate in the European war and to echo Wallace's visit to Chongqing, etc.</p>

<h3>Confident That Japanese Army Will Be Victorious</h3>
<p>The serious losses suffered by the enemy America in this battle were not only hundreds of ships. Even Roosevelt himself had to express pessimism in Congress and during meetings with reporters. Later, he even announced a naval expansion plan, adopting a feigned weakness tactic. All of these were typical tricks when the U.S. military suffered heavy losses. Although the U.S. fleet has been resupplied with a large number of ships, the decline in the morale of the crew members cannot be prevented, and the unfavorable situation is only increasing. On the contrary, our country's strategic posture, due to the large number of important islands scattered everywhere, will never suffer any damage from minor air raids. On the other hand, the enemy's battleships and aircraft carriers are more vulnerable than these land bases. We, the Japanese people, are all calm and composed during this modern decisive battle, supporting the soldiers on the front lines. No matter how difficult the situation is, we have the confidence to break through. In addition, China and other East Asian nations are also united in spirit, confident that Japan will achieve absolute victory, and actively cooperating. We anticipate that the enemy's various fabricated propaganda will become increasingly active in the future, but this will only encourage the strong morale of China and Japan and the East Asian nations, and contribute to the final victory.</p>

<p>News of Student Assistance for Readers; Notice to Shen Students and Recommended Schools</p>
<p>To save costs, the application form no longer requires a photo to be attached. Newly admitted students will submit photos later, and current students will use their previous photos. Applicants who have dropped out of school should fill out a recommendation form from Jianye School recently. Applicants from other cities should attach their most recent grade report. Please fill out the recommendation form in detail so that it can be used as a reference when selecting students. It is believed that all recommended students are poor and excellent, and should be subsidized. However, due to limited resources and a large number of applicants, it is necessary to select a small number of particularly poor and particularly excellent students from among the poor and excellent. Therefore, please cooperate fully with each school to ensure greater fairness. If the recommenders are generous and treat everyone equally, it is not a thorough solution. For example, there is a question in the recommendation form: "If the student recommended by your school can only be approved for 75%, should the student be approved? If only 25% can be approved, should the student be approved?" On every recommendation form sent by a certain school, the answer to these two questions is affirmative. The school authorities sympathize with every applicant, which is not wrong. However, the facts cannot be changed by the virtue of compassion. The whole cannot be equal to 75%, let alone 25%. If the number of applicants exceeds the number of new students several times during your school's entrance examination, what method can you use to admit all of them? In short, the office hopes that the school authorities can distinguish the degree of poverty and excellence of the applicants in their school as much as possible to supplement the shortcomings of future examinations and investigations. The application form and recommendation form must be sent to the office no later than July 1st. A receipt will be issued upon arrival. Present the receipt on July 11th or 12th to collect the registration form, distribute it to the applicants, and wait for the examination or other selection methods. For the convenience of school authorities and applicants, the office has decided to set July 15th as the date for each school to distribute registration certificates. It is of course also possible to set your own date and notify the applicants. A few schools have requested a delay of a few days in submitting the list of recommendation forms due to old test scores. This will be accommodated and will not be answered separately.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Deceased Son, Transferring Books to Assist</h3>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Hu Youyun Guangsheng: "My second son, Ning, graduated from the Sino-French National Institute of Technology, is proficient in English and French. He was filial to his parents, sincere in friendship, diligent in his studies, and loyal to his duties. In 1937, he went to Chongqing, and due to excessive hard work, he died of illness in the Chongqing Red Cross Hospital in October 1941, at the age of only 29. When he left Shanghai, he told his brother: 'The books must be carefully preserved, so that I can read them when I come back.' His love of learning can be seen. Unexpectedly, his ambitions were not fulfilled, which is deeply regrettable! Considering that poor children in the world are now facing a situation where Luoyang paper is expensive and buying books is very difficult, I will transfer my deceased son's books for public benefit." Attached is a list of books, totaling thirty-three. (Note) Mr. Hu's donation of books to assist Qingxiu students in memory of his late son is a very good intention. This office will definitely forward them on your behalf. The method will be announced later. This is to express our gratitude.</p>

<p>The China Confucian Society wrote: "Your newspaper has been handling student aid funds for many years, carefully reviewing and planning, and the results have been remarkable. In this time of extreme hardship, it is expected that tuition fees will increase sharply in the next semester. In order to encourage generous donations, the Society is offering one hundred large-format 'Confucius Holy Images' as gifts. Those who donate 2,000 yuan or more will receive one image each. (This is a beautifully printed edition from the Nanxun Hall of the Forbidden City) to leave a permanent memorial."</p>

<h3>National Forum: My Accusation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shoutong</p>
<p>Regarding the Issues of Teachers, Students, and Tuition Fees</p>
<p>Everyone knows that society, the nation, and the ethnicity are a continuous organic body. The cells of this organic body have a metabolic function: as old, unsuitable cells die, new, healthy cells fill in. But how can we lay the foundation for new life on the graves of the dead? This requires the nurturing and cultivation of education, criticism, and reform.</p>
<p>And this is precisely the problem of educating the next generation.</p>
<p>Especially in China, a China that has been gasping for breath under foreign oppression for nearly a century, the work of educating the next generation is urgent. But in this chaotic and turbulent era, everyone knows that education is neither a practical need nor can it reap direct combat effects. Therefore, educational problems do not easily attract attention from all parties, and it is even more difficult to find a way to thoroughly solve them from attention. In other words, today, after the outbreak of the war, people generally concentrate their energy on other issues and take a dismissive attitude towards education, forgetting the importance of education, which can stop the regenerative function of the educational organism. And now, the livelihood issue of teachers and staff, which is at the forefront of educational problems, has also arisen seriously. Regarding this, Shen Bao has proposed repeated discussions, and various parties have expressed their opinions, which can be summarized into the following three proposals: The authorities allocate monthly subsidies to teachers and staff. Student parents voluntarily donate to the school according to three levels: A, B, and C. Increase tuition fees. Regarding the first proposal, the results in the past few months have not been ideal, so it is clearly a failure. The second proposal has been implemented, but it is not universal, and it is a drop in the bucket, which does not help the actual situation. On the contrary, because "donation" and "relief" are used to help teachers, the psychology of respecting teachers is almost swept away. Therefore, recently, from the plans of Gu Xiao authorities, we have heard a chorus of "increasing tuition fees". Some people advocate that tuition fees should be calculated based on the rice price on August 1st, that is, 3 to 4 dou for elementary school, 5 to 6 dou for middle school, and 8 to 9 dou for university. Some people even advocate implementing the measure of voluntary donations from student parents at the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, this is not building education, but destroying it.</p>
<p>Here, I, as a member of the education community in Guangz[hou], raise an accusation!</p>
<p>Yes, some time ago, I and thousands of educators initiated the organization of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff. All the procedures had been carried out quite completely, but after repeated negotiations, the issue of material rationing could not be resolved reasonably. After running around for months, the result was not satisfactory. This also chills the hearts of those who are enthusiastic about education. However, I have always believed that using the form of a consumer cooperative to solve the livelihood problems of teachers and staff is the most reasonable and fundamental solution. Now that this form cannot be quickly realized, we should take a step back and engage in remedies. But "increasing tuition fees" is definitely not a proper remedy. Why? This is because first, it can cause poor students to drop out of school.</p>
<p>Second, it makes the fundraising movement for student aid funds in newspapers more difficult due to insufficient funds.</p>
<p>Third, for the wealthy with thousands of fortunes, they have not fulfilled some more obligations because of their economic affluence.</p>
<p>Here, especially the first point is the most serious. It makes education the patent of the children of wealthy families, making China, which cannot popularize education, fall into a situation where it cannot popularize education. Originally, education is by no means one-sided. It includes both the teacher and the taught. Without the taught and without the teacher, it is of course impossible to receive education. Without the teacher and without the taught, it is even more impossible to exert education. So for those "increasing tuition fees" proponents who only know one thing but not the other, I want to accuse!</p>
<p>Yes, I want to accuse, but at the same time I also want to present my humble opinion. I advocate that the salaries of teachers and staff should be increased, but the tuition fees of students should also be reduced.</p>
<p>Under this premise, I want to propose the collection of "education donations" from entertainment donations and special consumption taxes.</p>
<p>The method is as follows: All establishments such as cigarettes, alcohol, coffee shops, restaurants, movie theaters, theaters, dance studios, and all entertainment and consumption venues should add a few percent of education donations in addition to the usual collection of donations. As for "how many" percent, it should be carefully budgeted by experts. The standard of the budget is: to increase the monthly salary of elementary school teachers and staff to 15,000 yuan, junior high school teachers and staff to 20,000 yuan, senior high school teachers and staff to 25,000 yuan, and university teachers and staff to 30,000 yuan, so that they can all be at ease in their jobs and work hard to run schools. (Detailed rules to be discussed separately)</p>
<p>This is by no means a mere ideal. If the relevant authorities have the ability to seek educational development, if people in society can truly sympathize with Chinese education, then I deeply hope that the above proposals can win resonance, criticism, improvement, and realization.</p>
<p>Education is for everyone and belongs to everyone. As a member of the education community, I dare not hide my shortcomings and I am even more unwilling to remain silent. I have presented my accusation and described my hopes.</p>
<h3>Naval Painter (9) Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"How is it? Perhaps it's too cramped and uncomfortable!"</p>
<p>Takao ran into the room first, turned on the light, and said this. Shinji laughed, and without any restraint, sat down on the nautical chart and said:</p>
<p>"This can't help but amaze me. On destroyers, even the captain's cabin is just like this. Ah, there are many paintings. Are they all your work?"</p>
<p>"They are all my practice pieces. The painting I hoped Shinji would see is actually one I took to my teacher's house today."</p>
<p>"I certainly don't understand art very well, but I feel that all of these are very good paintings. Where did you paint this submarine picture?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I painted it in this room. I saw the I-class submarine in a military logbook, and then imagined and depicted a submarine underway. No matter what, relying on imagination isn't quite right."</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. It's actually like that. Your brushwork is truly good enough."</p>
<p>Shinji's face lit up with joy. In Takao's heart, he regarded Shinji as a naval officer and his only confidant, so such praise was more powerful than anyone else's.</p>
<p>"Thank you. I want to work hard and not lose to you."</p>
<p>Later, the topic turned to the navy. Naval academy, ocean voyages, ensign candidates, and other matters were discussed one by one, endlessly. Takao listened like a fool, carefully taking in every word.</p>
<p>"When you were promoted from candidate to ensign, you must have been very happy!"</p>
<p>"Of course!"</p>
<p>Shinji smiled gently and began to describe the situation at that time.</p>
<p>Promotion from candidate to ensign wasn't just about the sleeve stripes becoming thicker, or the hem of the uniform becoming longer; at this time, one was no longer an unfeathered fledgling, but had already become a fully fledged officer, so everything was different. For example, attending sudden gatherings and drinking alcohol, candidates would not receive formal permission, while ensigns could drink freely. At the naval club, one could also swagger in and out. Naval slang could also be used freely. Hairstyles were also at one's own discretion. Once one became an ensign, one could also wear the Western-style suits that were previously called "merchant's attire" but were now called "casual clothes."</p>
<p>"As soon as I was promoted, I had this suit made. At the Yokosuka naval club, the Yamashiro district clothing store was eager for business."</p>
<p>"But wouldn't it be even more pleasant to walk around wearing an ensign's uniform?"</p>
<p>"Not really. If you wear casual clothes, the sailors don't have to stop and salute, so you don't have to pay attention to them."</p>
<p>A trace of gentle smile radiated from Shinji's face. Although he was wearing a Western suit, the naval ensign's spirit and hope could be seen from his sharply outlined eyes. (108)</p>
