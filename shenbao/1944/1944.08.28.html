<h2>Page 1</h2>
<h3>談歐洲戰局</h3>
<p>問，巴黎已入巷戰狀態，南法反軸心軍又已登陸，今後歐洲局勢將如何發展？</p>
<p>答：目前歐洲戰局重心，誠然集中於法國戰塲。然最後決戰之地，無寗說須在德國邊境決定之。姑就法國戰塲而言，英美方面原來戰略，也許企圖在巴黎附近展開最後決戰，逼便軸心國主力與他們一拚生死。但是結果，敵方這一戰略是失敗了。第一，是兩月餘來，敵方難冒重大損失，却未能抓住德國的主力軍加以打擊；第二，敵軍以不克在預定戰略地點打擊軸心軍，不得不再在其他地區開闢戰塲，其兵力乃愈趨分散；第三，軸心軍的避離戰略成功，可以自由選擇今後決戰有利地區，集中力量，使勞師深入而實力分散之敵，遭到最後的失敗。</p>
<p>問：但是，德國不是尙須分力以應付蘇聯在東綫的進攻嗎？這一方面的趨勢如何？</p>
<p>答：蘇聯方面的戰略是和政略一致的，即企圖利用英美對西歐的「第二戰綫」，傾舉全力，越華沙而入柏林。但是現在大局已漸明朗，內部擾亂的政變已經完全失敗，而西進的蘇軍，也已在德國最近的反攻之下，徘徊於東普魯士的邊境，對於早已宣傳即可攻下的華沙計劃至今不能實現。</p>
<p>問：然而蘇聯軍隊這幾天不是改向西南方面發動政勢了嗎？</p>
<p>答：誠然，蘇軍業已攻陷雅西等城市，向羅馬尼亞進迫，致羅國發生類似義大利的政變，田羅王宣布對蘇停戰，談判和平。蘇軍這一進展，顯然因爲在東普魯士及華沙作戰失敗以後乘虛攻弱的徼倖收獲。但是，這一方面的局勢也不這樣簡單：第一，羅國已成立繼續聯德抗蘇的新政權，否認羅王的屈辱和平，羅軍將繼續對蘇軍作戰到底；第二，蘇聯放棄直接侵攻德國本土計劃，轉向巴爾幹方面，顯然因爲攻德結果不免失敗，縱有所獲，將來仍必交出，不若向巴雨幹拓展勢力之來得實惠，因此，在戰略上更可促發美英蘇間的新矛盾。</p>
<p>問：這一方面，土耳其的動態不是有舉足輕重之勢嗎？今後東南歐與近東的局勢如何？</p>
<p>答：土耳其最近在英美蘇三方面壓迫之下，不得不對德絕交，其處境之苦，誠可同情，而政策之愚，則足以陷國家於悲慘的戰爭。反軸心國，勢必進而要求利用土國各重要基地及海峽，並將迫使土國參戰。觀乎蘇聯方面在土耳其對德絕交後之評論，尙不滿於土國繼續維持對羅·保·斯·南各國外交，可見反軸心國野心之一斑。今後蘇軍向多瑙河流域發展，則結果必不免以利用土耳其的海峽問題而釀成英美蘇三國問不可解救的</p>
<p>問：那麼軸心國前途如何？</p>
<p>答：反軸心方面的矛盾傾向，當然就是軸心方面的樂觀條件。同時，我們尤應注意德國自從政變陰謀失敗以後，上下一致，團結益堅，新動員百萬兵力，今後將主動選擇有利戰塲，足以粉碎敵人的任何戰略。</p>
<h3>大東亞各地日軍　一週間綜合戰果　對來襲敵機予以重大損失</h3>
<p>東京廿六日中央社電　本週各戰綫戰况如次：</p>
<h3>北太平洋</h3>
<p>八月二十日與廿一日黎明，敵機數架　兩次襲擊北千島，日軍無損失。來襲北千島之敵機，八月上旬爲六架，下旬達二十架，並多爲晝間空襲，似已有活潑進展之傾向。日本土西部地方，八月廿四日傍晚及夜半，駐渝美空軍合計百架內外，空襲北九州及中國西部地方，日制空部隊迎擊戰果，確實擊洛敵機廿三架，不確實者約十架以上，擊毀者約二十餘架，敵於此重大打擊下，倉皇退去，又於大陸上空亦被擊落一架，料於海上亦可擊落若干架。</p>
<h3>中國方面</h3>
<p>湖南方面日軍確保各要衝繼續攻擊，渝軍於衡陽附近仍有十師，渝軍與一部機械化部隊與日軍對峙，日軍現正加度構築陣地中。耒陽正面，渝軍第三十七第九十九兩軍，由於日軍痛擊，戰力已形低下，現並無何積極企圖。湘江東側地區，渝軍第二十第四十四第五十八第七十二各軍中，第五十八第五十二兩軍現正企圖再度奪回醴陵，於該地附近活動中。湘口西側益陽湘鄉西方附近，渝第七十三軍之一部及現自常德方面南下之第七十四軍之一部，尙無何大變化。　「航空作戰」八月十七日至廿一日五日間，於戰塲上空與來襲敵機作戰所獲戰果，計擊落敵機十四架，現敵機來勢仍未稍息，平均每次均在百架內外。</p>
<h3>印度洋方面</h3>
<p>（甲）安南泰國方面於八月中旬敵十一次，達二十九架，泰國爲二次兩架，均係遊擊作戰性質。（乙）緬甸方面怒江正面日軍，依然確保各耍衝，將自各方面來攻之渝軍擊退，拉孟騰越芒市各方面渝軍已漸活躍，尤其騰越方而自八月十五日以來，及龍陵方而自八月十六日以來，敵軍以猛烈之砲火，開始正面攻擊，現正繼續激戰中。日軍經勇敢作戰後所獲戰果，自八月十二日至十九日已確實判明渝軍棄屍達二千百十八具。（丙）蘇門答臘方面八月二十四日晨敵艦載機數十架，兩次來襲巴丹地區（西海岸中部），經日軍迎擊後，擊落敵機二架，並與以相當損害將其擊退。</p>
<h3>中太平洋</h3>
<p>（甲）馬利亞納羣島迭尼安大宮島之作戰已歷三旬，日軍以寡敵衆仍在激鬥，二十日晚間敵空軍曾對該島南部日軍陣地作猛烈轟炸，敵艦艇更由海面砲擊。二十三日敵空軍及艦隊，更對該島最南端加羅暫納斯高地日，羅塔島自十八日起之三日間，曾有敵機約計四十架來襲，被擊落二架，</p>
<p>（乙）加羅林羣島雅浦島，自二十日起三日間，有敵B24型重轟烽機約計二十架來襲帛琉羣島，十七日以來每日有敵機數架來襲，特魯克島方面十七日有敵B24型機二十五架來襲，二十一日有敵B24型機約三十架來襲，被擊落擊毀十架。（丙）馬紹爾羣島渥要島，十八日起三日間，有敵小型機累計約十八架來襲，那盧島十八日十九日兩日，有敵B25型機三十五架來襲，塔羅阿島十八日有敵B24型機二架來襲。（丁）小笠原羣島父島，二十三日有敵重轟炸機二架來襲，被擊落一架，硫黃島十七日有敵B24型機十九架來襲，南鳥島二十二日有敵B24型機四架來襲。</p>

<h3>周隆庠飛日</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　行政院秘書長周隆庠氏，曾於月初返京，旋又赴日。茲悉周氏爲處理秘書處事務，於日前由日歸國，對秘書處要公部署完畢，巳於今晨離京飛日</p>
<h3>浙省獻機獻鐵　成績良佳</h3>
<p>杭州二十七日中央社電　浙省官民前爲協力大東亞戰爭，特發起獻機獻鐵運動，動員各市縣組織獻機獻鐵委會。自開始以來，成績極佳，且蕭山·嘉善·兩縣第一期解空獻機款項，已超過原定數額。第二期獻機款項，亦於日前解省，超過原額達二十二萬元之多。</p>
<h3>湖南戰綫渝軍　兵力消耗極大　衡陽附近仍激戰中</h3>
<p>湖南前綫二十七日中央社電　中國戰綫戰事激烈，渝軍兵力及兵器之損失極大，故其戰力亦日趨低落，此爲不可掩飾之事實。據日軍當局發表，湖南戰綫截止八月初旬，渝軍之損失，計陳亡六萬六千四百六十八名，被俘二萬七千四百四十七名，此外合計受傷罹病者約有二十二萬六千四百之衆。又日軍鹵獲之兵器，約可供十師之用，迄今渝軍活動於湖南戰錢與日軍交戰者，約有四十五師兵力，約四十萬人。據上述情形，可知渝軍兵力已消耗半數以上，但渝軍方面虛報日軍之損失，亦作擴大宣傳，圖矇蔽事實。如渝軍發言人曾慶極於十八日對外國記者稱，日軍二十萬中有兩師之衆兵力三萬六千餘人，已被殲滅云云。但此虛報日軍損失數字，如較之渝軍損失，猶相差極遠。據渝軍發表其補充兵力之最後手段，乃於第六第九兩戰區中，實施「後調師制度」，基於此制度所得之新軍，於敎育或訓育方面，當然含糊其事，烏合之衆，不足與精銳之日軍作戰，可想而知，或僅爲於後方從事遊擊戰而已。又因該「後調師制度」爲强制民衆出動於戰綫之措置，致引起民衆之不滿，反之對於日軍之布吿，均表信賴，因之投入和平地區者日有增加之勢。故「後關師制度」亦歸失敗，其不能補充損失，當可證實。又至今衡陽周圍之渝軍十數師，已為日軍所包圍而趨殲滅之勢。因之有由雲南出兵增援之舉，但此項軍隊抵達湖南戰綫，需要二月至三個月之期間，有遠水不救近火之感。故渝軍之消耗，與抗戰力低落，已成必然之勢，渝方似亦爲之極感焦慮云。</p>
<p>廣州二十七日中央社電　日軍攻佔衡陽後，仍靈勝繼續進攻粤漢綫及湘桂綫，據二十五日渝中央電，渝軍發言人曾慶極少將會見記者，發表湖南戰况云：過去一週間，湖南各地雖仍繼續激戰，但無甚進展。刻兩軍在衡陽南方湘桂鐵路沿錢展開惡鬥，耒陽東西地區渝軍猛攻，刻安仁荼陵及醴陵郊外，亦正激戰中。</p>
<p>漢口二十七日中央社電　美方近來積極於太平洋戰區增强實力，構成美渝聯合戰綫，準備反攻。美國今春以來，派多數專家赴渝組織機械化部隊，由駐渝傘兵　成兩團，最近派往桂林柳州等地，渝軍唯一機械化兵團第五軍，曾以美國裝備編為赴緬遠征軍，近爲應付日軍之湖南作戰，業已調回。渝第四戰區司令部已移至湘桂綫，湖南未來大戰正在醞釀中。</p>
<h3>日機隊襲遂川贛州</h3>
<p>某陸大基地二十七日中央社電　日空軍曾於二十五日以夜間轟炸機隊，急襲江西省遂川贛州兩機傷，炸毀經塲附屬設施。贛州機塲並有小型機一架中彈起火，詳細戰果因夜間視綫不佳，尙不能確認。又昨夜日機全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>豫渝共軍被日擊退</h3>
<p>河南二十七日中央社電　本月十七日晨，臨邑縣保安隊，在縣城西北六公里之馬平水寨附近，曾遭共黨平禹縣保安隊約四百人圍攻，魯南日軍接報後，急遽出動救援，卒將圍攻之共軍擊潰。又十九日亦有渝軍約二百餘人，侵入章邱縣之行政督察專員公署，日軍據報，復迅速與縣保安隊協力淸勦，渝軍卒吿敗退。此外日軍部隊，曾於二十一日對蠢動於章邱之西彩石附近之渝軍，施行夜襲，使受重創而潰退。以上各役中，日軍收容渝軍屍體共廿五具。</p>
<h3>羅馬尼亞新閣員名單</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　據布加勒斯特電：羅馬尼亞新閣重要人員如次：首相陸軍上將薩那台斯考，外長普愛斯特，其他閣員于尼·貝爾得斯克·甫拉迭阿·及巴耳特拉斯加斯等。</p>
<h3>德與羅叛軍　入交戰狀態</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　德元首行營發表：布加勒斯特區及其他巿內之德軍，已將羅叛軍之再三攻擊擊退，由此可知德軍現起羅叛軍己入交戰伏態。德軍當局會就此事說明如次：羅京德國官署，刻因被羅警察隊包圍，現下已不能直接連絡，此乃外交史上之變例。</p>
<h3>保通知蘇聯　決嚴守中立</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十七日中央社電　據莫斯科電：保加利亞外長特拉加諾夫廿六日訓令該國駐蘇代理大使基拉慶諾天，代表該國政府芷式通吿蘇聯，表明該國對蘇聯決定維持完全中立。</p>
<h3>斯洛伐克全國戒嚴</h3>
<p>沮里希二十七日中央社電　斯洛伐克政府二十六日頒布呈全國戒嚴令，並命令國家保安警察隊，肅淸所有搗亂份子。</p>
<h3>德重傷乓一批　假道瑞士返國</h3>
<p>伯爾基二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：瑞士常局根據海牙公約，允許載運重傷德兵之火車數列，自義大利經瑞士駛返德國，第一批火車於二十五日抵齊亞索，經巴斯勒駛往德國。</p>
<h3>西班牙元首檢閱防軍</h3>
<p>馬德里二十七日中央社電　海通社訊；弗朗哥元首昨偕其軍事內閣長官葛朗特將軍，檢閱科倫那衛戍軍之演習，事後返特梅拉斯之夏季行營。</p>
<p>迭尼安大宮兩島日軍奮戰中</p>
<p>敵機兩架襲鞍山未逞</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地二十七日中央社電　二十五日夜遙見迭尼安大宮兩島上空，有照明彈數十發，閃爍放光，該兩島日軍部隊似仍繼續與敵作白刃戰中。</p>
<p>新京二十七日中央社電　二十七日下午零時四十分，有敵機二架自中國方面侵入鞍山上空，經日軍制空部隊邀擊，卒米能投彈，即行遁去。</p>
<p>美那多二十七日中央社電　美那多（西里伯島北端）當地日軍發表：二十四日晝間有敵北美型機六架，來襲西里伯島北部美那多地區，經日海軍迎擊，擊落其一架。</p>
<h3>勝利的要素（二）</h3>
<p>— 白鳥敏夫</p>
<p>——堅持國體的信念——</p>
<p>民族的將來置之度外</p>
<p>因而猶太與日本是對立的國家，他們的目的，是破壞日本國體。羅斯福曾說過：「將日本從地球上抹去。」這是希昂的話。非猶太血統的人不能作此言。一國的總統說這種話，可見猶太的指導者對日本有無限的戰意。在這種指導者下，長期間被指導者美國人民，以今日這樣熱烈的敵愾心與戰意對付日本，自不足爲奇。</p>
<p>本來敵方的指導者，無論在英國，在美國，其國家的利益，國民的幸福，都置之度外。所以他們不惜在國民之問付出了多少犧牲，不管怎樣浪費物資與生命，毫不介意。這一點，在蘇俄最爲明瞭。即他們並不考慮民族的將來而後行動，爲了完成野心，想盡種種施策，使民放盡全部的力量。</p>
<p>此次大戰日趨激烈後，在可能範圍內珍惜兵士生命的最初方針，業已棄置，揭開假面具，視兵士的生命爲塵芥，太平洋如此，歐洲戰綫亦如此，但他們焦慮勝利之態，則愈見顯著。同時，此對一般英美國民，給與極深刻的衝動。而深刻的衝動，轉變爲反戰氣氛的橫溢，在國民本身本來沒有戰爭目的的英美國民，是勢所必然的。到那時候，戰局可說快近結束了</p>
<p>此次的歐洲登陸，規模雖小，但英國已付了最大的犧牲。最近軍需生產大臣李特爾頓曾稱：將日本引入戰爭的是美國，英國在太平洋戰爭中不能盡全力。就上述見地而言，頗具深長意義，而反映英國人民的氣氛。總之，英國因漸感困苦，乃希望美國對歐洲還要出力，不如此幹不下去了。李特爾頓的話，就代表英國人的這一種心境。</p>
<h3>我敵絕不相容</h3>
<p>要之，日本與英美絕對不相容。戰爭的深刻性就在於此。但敵的戰爭目的與國民大衆無關係，因而戰爭延長下去，民衆大約會捨棄指導者而終止戰爭的。尤其在美國，以我看來，這種可能性極多。所以我們似應對敵國民衆宣揚此方面正確的戰爭目的，指出他們指導者的惡魔性。</p>
<p>前次的戰爭，民主主義的英美，計劃對德國敵間其皇帝，軍隊與民衆之間的關係。這一次我方的官民打成一片，絕無離間的餘地，祗有敵方被少數的野心所鼓舞。我們應乘隙開始宣傳戰，使敵國人民明悉眞相。</p>
<p>有人問，萬一敵方勝利，又將如何？此在我們日本人連想像也不必。祗要堅持對日本國體的正確信念，日本不會失敗。這一點在日本人不是還沒有充分明瞭嗎？</p>
<p>我以爲這次戰爭不決於戰塲的勝負，而決於後方態勢的强弱優劣。美國在這一點頗感不安。反之，就我們的例看來，德國的後方，今日已成不死之身。即在前綫，如瑟堡，斯達林格勒等，也與日軍同樣勇敢善鬥。後方國民，也極堅定，到底不能打倒。總之，萬邦共戴我無比國體的日本，實是全世界最堅確的，結果，戰爭將賴此獲勝。戰民或許愈趨嚴重，但確信不會挫傷正在昂揚中的日本國民的戰意。</p>
<p>總之，我們必須使對方的指導者與一般國民分離，那應該如何才好呢？要使對方　見到戰爭沒有勝算。而那雖然除了戰塲的攻勢以外無他，但在另一方面，我們應將日木的光明芷大的目的，如何建造戰後共榮圈，在事實上表現出來，同時在言論上吿訴出來，不管對方聽與不聽，使滲透於對方。事實上，對方聽短波的人相當多，前次的大東亞宣言，亦曾在對方引起相當大的反響。現在他們的指導者，雖博得國民的好評，因爲他們以為戰爭可以勝利，而被其指導者的主論所鼓舞，然一旦明白我們正確的正張，那中間必露出馬脚。結果，他們會明白，這次戰爭不是爲了羅斯福嗎？羅斯福不是猶太人嗎？這是不能不使他們明瞭的一點。（完）（翔：譯自七月十三日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>敎員待遇　應予切實改善　敎育界前輩發表意見</h3>
<p>本市各級學校，邇來生活程度高漲，爲顧及敎職員生活及學校開文起見，對下學期之學費，均照上學期提高約四倍，平均中學學費爲五千元，故今後本市各校敎員待遇，常大有改善之餘地。惟以過去情形而論，頗多學校之經費，均由校長一人掌理，絕不公開，是以學費提高四倍之後，敎員之待遇應有如何之改善始爲合理，頗爲各界所重視，本報記者特走訪敎育界前輩某氏，承發表意見如下：</p>
<p>「生活程度高漲，各校提高學費，實亦爲應付環境之不得已措置，蓋翠費提高，失學人數目必增加，此種現象，究非國家社會之福。今幸社會各方對於失學者之搶敎，熱心踴躍，　益匪淺。惟敎育之推進，非懂在乎救濟失學一道，　教員生活不得安定，則敎育前途，仍無樂歡之望，故學　提高後，對於敎員之待遇茍無合理之改善，不僅無補於整固敎育事業，口社會熱心，因此對於下學期各校敎可重視。</p>
<p>按目前各校收費，平均中學爲五千元，如每班人數爲五十人，則每班收費即達二十五萬元，按照過去敎育法令之規定，除百分之三十用作學校行政費用，百分之七十中之百分之二十五爲職員薪俸外，餘均應作敎員薪給，是則二十五萬元中，應劃作敎員薪給數爲十三萬一千二百餘元，以此數分作六個月計，則每月之敎員薪給數爲二萬一千八百餘元，每月可以四週計，每週敎員薪給爲五千四百六十餘元，按照中學課程標準，每週每班授課三十小時計，則教員待遇每小時當在一百八十元度爲合理，本市頗多私立學校之敎薪，每學期僅作五個月計算者，是則照上述情形計，每小時之敎員待遇，應爲二百十八元度。</p>
<p>惟滬上學校林立，學生分配情形未必平均，且一部份幷無成續足爲社會人仕所信賴之學校，欲求每班能有五十人，實亦大非易事，但値茲戰爭時期，爲節省人力物力起見，對於每班僅有二十三，或僅一二十學生之學校，實亦有考慮使其合併上課之必要，否則徒糜費用，而敎員所得又難溫飽，於公於私，兩無裨益。至於學校行政費於百分中取其三十，照上述情形，每班約七萬五千元，以一校有高初中共六班計，每學期學校行政費爲四十五萬元，按照目前一般學校之設備情形，似亦不至有不數之慮」云。</p>

        <h1>1944.08.28</h1>
<h3>Discussing the European War Situation</h3>
<p>Question: Paris has entered a state of street fighting, and the anti-Axis forces have landed in Southern France. How will the European situation develop from now on?</p>
<p>Answer: Currently, the focus of the European war is indeed concentrated on the French battlefield. However, it is undeniable that the final decisive battle will be determined on the German border. Taking the French battlefield as an example, the original strategy of the British and American forces may have been to attempt a final decisive battle near Paris, forcing the main forces of the Axis powers to fight them to the death. However, in the end, this strategy of the enemy failed. First, for more than two months, the enemy has been unable to seize and strike the main force of the German army without suffering significant losses. Second, the enemy forces have been unable to strike the Axis forces at the predetermined strategic location and have had to open up battlefields in other areas, resulting in an increasingly dispersed force. Third, the Axis forces' strategy of avoiding battle has succeeded, allowing them to freely choose favorable areas for future decisive battles, concentrate their strength, and inflict a final defeat on the enemy, who has penetrated deep with exhausted troops and dispersed strength.</p>
<p>Question: But doesn't Germany still have to divide its forces to cope with the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front? What is the trend in this area?</p>
<p>Answer: The Soviet strategy is consistent with its political strategy, which is to try to take advantage of the British and American "Second Front" in Western Europe, to concentrate all its efforts, cross Warsaw, and enter Berlin. However, the overall situation has gradually become clear. The internal coup has completely failed, and the westward-advancing Soviet troops, under the recent German counter-offensive, are hovering on the border of East Prussia, and the plan to capture Warsaw, which has long been touted as imminent, has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>Question: But haven't the Soviet troops shifted their political momentum towards the southwest in the past few days?</p>
<p>Answer: Indeed, the Soviet army has already captured cities such as Iasi and is pressing towards Romania, causing Romania to experience a coup similar to that in Italy, with King Michael announcing an armistice with the Soviet Union and negotiating peace. This progress of the Soviet army is clearly a lucky harvest from taking advantage of the weakness after the failures in East Prussia and Warsaw. However, the situation in this area is not that simple: First, a new government has been established in Romania to continue its alliance with Germany and resist the Soviet Union, denying the King's humiliating peace, and the Romanian army will continue to fight the Soviet army to the end. Second, the Soviet Union's abandonment of its plan to directly invade the German mainland and its shift towards the Balkans clearly stems from the fact that an attack on Germany would inevitably result in failure, and even if there were gains, they would inevitably have to be handed over in the future, which is not as beneficial as expanding its influence in the Balkans. Therefore, strategically, it could further promote new contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Question: In this regard, isn't Turkey's dynamic in a pivotal position? What will be the situation in Southeastern Europe and the Near East in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: Turkey has recently been forced to sever relations with Germany under pressure from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Its difficult situation is indeed worthy of sympathy, but its foolish policy is enough to plunge the country into a tragic war. The anti-Axis powers will inevitably demand the use of Turkey's important bases and straits and will force Turkey to participate in the war. Judging from the Soviet Union's comments after Turkey severed relations with Germany, it is still not satisfied with Turkey's continued maintenance of diplomatic relations with Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Yugoslavia, which shows a glimpse of the ambition of the anti-Axis powers. In the future, if the Soviet army develops towards the Danube River basin, the result will inevitably lead to an unsolvable question among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union over the issue of using the Turkish Straits.</p>
<p>Question: So what is the future of the Axis powers?</p>
<p>Answer: The tendency of contradictions on the anti-Axis side is, of course, an optimistic condition for the Axis side. At the same time, we should pay particular attention to the fact that since the failure of the coup plot in Germany, the entire country has been united and strengthened. The new mobilization of a million troops will allow Germany to actively choose favorable battlefields and be sufficient to crush any enemy strategy.</p>
<h3>Daily Military Results of Japanese Forces in Various Parts of Greater East Asia for One Week, Inflicting Significant Losses on Attacking Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation on each front this week is as follows:</p>
<h3>North Pacific</h3>
<p>On August 20th and 21st at dawn, several enemy aircraft twice attacked the Northern Kuril Islands. The Japanese army suffered no losses. The number of enemy aircraft attacking the Northern Kuril Islands was six in early August and reached twenty in late August, and most were daytime air raids, seemingly with a tendency for vigorous progress. In the western part of Japan proper, on the evening and midnight of August 24th, a total of about 100 U.S. Air Force aircraft stationed in Chongqing attacked northern Kyushu and western China. The Japanese air defense units engaged them, resulting in the confirmed destruction of 23 enemy aircraft and an estimated 10 or more unconfirmed. About 20 or more were damaged. Under this significant blow, the enemy retreated in panic. In addition, one enemy aircraft was shot down over the mainland, and it is expected that some will also be shot down at sea.</p>
<h3>China Front</h3>
<p>In Hunan, the Japanese army is securing key points and continuing its attacks. The Chongqing army still has ten divisions near Hengyang. The Chongqing army and a mechanized unit are confronting the Japanese army. The Japanese army is currently intensifying the construction of its defenses. On the Leiyang front, the Chongqing army's 37th and 99th Armies have been severely weakened by the Japanese army's attacks and currently have no active intentions. In the area east of the Xiang River, among the Chongqing army's 20th, 44th, 58th, and 72nd Armies, the 58th and 52nd Armies are currently attempting to retake Liling and are active in the vicinity. In the area west of Xiangkou, near Yiyang and west of Xiangxiang, there is no major change in a portion of the Chongqing army's 73rd Army and a portion of the 74th Army currently moving south from Changde. "Air Operations" During the five days from August 17th to 21st, the results achieved in combat with attacking enemy aircraft over the battlefield were 14 enemy aircraft shot down.

The enemy army has launched frontal attacks with intense artillery fire and is currently continuing fierce battles. After courageous combat, the Japanese army's results, from August 12th to 19th, have been confirmed to show that the Chongqing army abandoned 2,118 bodies. (C) In the Sumatra area, on the morning of August 24th, dozens of enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked the Padang area (central western coast) twice. After the Japanese army engaged them, they shot down two enemy aircraft and inflicted considerable damage, repelling them.</p>

<p>Hunan Front, 27th (Central News Agency) - The war on the China front is fierce, and the Chongqing army has suffered extremely high losses in manpower and equipment, so its combat strength is declining day by day, which is an undeniable fact. According to a statement by the Japanese military authorities, the Chongqing army's losses on the Hunan front up to the beginning of August totaled 66,468 killed in action, 27,447 captured, and an additional 226,400 wounded and sick. In addition, the weapons captured by the Japanese army can supply about ten divisions. To date, the Chongqing army operating on the Hunan front and fighting the Japanese army has about 45 divisions, or about 400,000 men. According to the above situation, it can be seen that the Chongqing army's manpower has been depleted by more than half, but the Chongqing army is falsely reporting the Japanese army's losses and making exaggerated propaganda in an attempt to conceal the facts. For example, Chongqing army spokesman Zeng Qingji told foreign reporters on the 18th that two divisions, or more than 36,000 men, of the Japanese army's 200,000 troops had been annihilated. However, this falsely reported figure of Japanese army losses is still far from the Chongqing army's losses. According to the Chongqing army's announcement of its final means of replenishing manpower, it is implementing a "Rear Transfer Division System" in the Sixth and Ninth War Zones. The new troops obtained under this system are, of course, vague about education or training. It is conceivable that this rabble is not enough to fight the elite Japanese army, or it is only engaged in guerrilla warfare in the rear. Moreover, because this "Rear Transfer Division System" is a measure to forcibly mobilize the people to the front lines, it has aroused dissatisfaction among the people. On the contrary, they trust the Japanese army's announcements and increasingly move into peaceful areas. Therefore, the "Rear Transfer Division System" has also failed, which proves that it cannot replenish the losses. Moreover, the dozen or so divisions of the Chongqing army surrounding Hengyang are now surrounded by the Japanese army and are about to be annihilated. As a result, there is a move to send troops from Yunnan to reinforce, but it will take two to three months for these troops to reach the Hunan front, which is like trying to put out a fire far away. Therefore, the Chongqing army's depletion and the decline in its ability to resist have become inevitable, and the Chongqing side seems to be extremely anxious about it.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, it continued its attacks on the Yuehan Railway and the Xianggui Railway. According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th, Chongqing army spokesman Major General Zeng Qingji met with reporters and announced the war situation in Hunan: In the past week, although fierce fighting has continued in various parts of Hunan, there has been little progress. The two armies are currently engaged in fierce fighting along the Xianggui Railway south of Hengyang. The Chongqing army is fiercely attacking the areas east and west of Leiyang, and fierce fighting is also taking place in the suburbs of Anren, Chaling, and Liling.</p>
<p>Hankou, 27th (Central News Agency) - The United States has recently been actively strengthening its strength in the Pacific theater, forming a joint US-Chongqing front to prepare for a counter-offensive. Since the spring of this year, the United States has sent a number of experts to Chongqing to organize mechanized units, consisting of two regiments of paratroopers stationed in Chongqing. Recently, they have been sent to Guilin, Liuzhou, and other places. The Chongqing army's only mechanized corps, the Fifth Army, which was equipped with American equipment and sent to Burma as an expeditionary force, has now been recalled to deal with the Japanese army's Hunan operation. The Chongqing Fourth War Zone Command has moved to the Xianggui Railway line, and a major battle in Hunan is brewing.</p>

<h3>The Elements of Victory (II)</h3>
<p>— Toshio Shiratori</p>
<p>—The Belief in Upholding the National Polity—</p>
<p>Putting the Future of the Nation Aside</p>
<p>Therefore, the Jews and Japan are opposing countries, and their goal is to destroy the Japanese national polity. Roosevelt once said: "Wipe Japan off the face of the earth." This is a Zionist statement. A person without Jewish blood could not say such a thing. The fact that a country's president says this shows that the Jewish leaders have unlimited war intentions towards Japan. Under such leaders, it is not surprising that the American people, who have been guided for a long time, deal with Japan with such fervent animosity and war intention today.</p>
<p>Originally, the leaders of the enemy, whether in Britain or the United States, put the interests of their country and the happiness of their people aside. Therefore, they do not hesitate to pay whatever sacrifices among their people, no matter how they waste materials and lives, they do not care. This is most evident in Soviet Russia. That is, they do not consider the future of the nation before acting. In order to fulfill their ambitions, they try every possible strategy to make the people use up all their strength.</p>
<p>After this war became increasingly fierce, the initial policy of cherishing the lives of soldiers as much as possible has been abandoned, the mask has been taken off, and the lives of soldiers are regarded as dust. This is true in the Pacific and on the European front, but their anxiety for victory is becoming more and more obvious. At the same time, this gives a very deep impulse to the general British and American people. And the deep impulse turns into an overflow of anti-war atmosphere, which is inevitable for the British and American people who originally had no war aims themselves. When that time comes, it can be said that the war is coming to an end.</p>
<p>Although the scale of the recent European landing is small, Britain has paid the greatest sacrifice. Recently, Minister of Munitions Production Lyttelton said: It was the United States that brought Japan into the war, and Britain could not devote all its efforts to the Pacific War. From the above point of view, it is of great significance and reflects the atmosphere of the British people. In short, Britain hopes that the United States will contribute more to Europe because it is gradually feeling difficult, and it cannot continue to do so otherwise. Lyttelton's words represent this kind of mood of the British people.</p>
<h3>Absolute Incompatibility</h3>
<p>In short, Japan and Britain and the United States are absolutely incompatible. The depth of the war lies in this. But the enemy's war aims have nothing to do with the masses of the people. Therefore, if the war is prolonged, the people will probably abandon their leaders and end the war. Especially in the United States, in my opinion, there is a great possibility of this. Therefore, it seems that we should publicize the correct war aims in this regard to the enemy people, pointing out the demonic nature of their leaders.</p>
<p>In the previous war, democratic Britain and the United States planned to alienate the emperor, the army, and the people of Germany. This time, our officials and civilians are united as one, and there is absolutely no room for alienation. Only the enemy is inspired by a few ambitions. We should take this opportunity to start a propaganda war to make the people of the enemy country understand the truth.</p>
<p>Some people ask, what if the enemy wins? We Japanese don't even need to imagine this. As long as we adhere to the correct belief in the Japanese national polity, Japan will not fail. Isn't this not yet fully understood by the Japanese?</p>
<p>I think this war is not determined by the victory or defeat on the battlefield, but by the strength and superiority of the rear. The United States is quite uneasy about this. On the other hand, judging from our example, Germany's rear is now immortal. That is, on the front lines, such as Cherbourg and Stalingrad, they are as brave and good at fighting as the Japanese army. The people in the rear are also very firm and cannot be defeated after all. In short, Japan, with its unparalleled national polity that all nations admire, is the most steadfast in the world. As a result, the war will be won by this. The war may become more and more serious, but I am confident that it will not dampen the war spirit of the Japanese people, which is on the rise.</p>
<p>In short, we must separate the leaders of the other side from the general public. How should we do that? We must make the other side see that there is no chance of winning the war. Although there is no other way to do that except through offensives on the battlefield, on the other hand, we should show in practice and tell in words how Japan's bright and great purpose is to build a post-war co-prosperity sphere, regardless of whether the other side listens or not, so that it permeates the other side. In fact, quite a few people on the other side listen to shortwave radios. The previous Greater East Asia Declaration also caused a considerable reaction on the other side. Now, their leaders are gaining the approval of the people because they believe that the war can be won and are inspired by the arguments of their leaders, but once they understand our correct claims, their falsehoods will be revealed. As a result, they will understand, isn't this war for Roosevelt? Isn't Roosevelt a Jew? This is a point that must be made clear to them.

<h3>City Market Report for the Past Week</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial market conditions in Shanghai remained stable last week.

The stock market fluctuated uncertainly until Friday, when the authorities announced that the Central Reserve Bank had obtained a 400 million yen loan from the Bank of Japan to strengthen the Central Reserve Bank notes and enhance their value. The baseless rumors of the past few days were proven false, and the entire financial system of Shanghai became even clearer to the people as a solid foundation. Public sentiment immediately returned to normal. The dark market prices fell back, the market situation normalized and stabilized, and the money supply tightened and then eased. The industrial and commercial sectors showed more signs of recovery. The market prices of daily necessities stopped rising and turned to stability. Rice prices also gradually fell as sources of supply slightly improved. The situation in the Chinese stock market was also not as chaotic as in the past.</p>

<h3>Lao Zha Branch Bureau Formulates Fingerprint Registration and Certificate Exchange Procedures</h3>
<p>In order to complete the fingerprint registration for the exchange of resident certificates for citizens as soon as possible, the Baojia Section of the Lao Zha Branch Bureau has formulated temporary measures based on the fingerprint registration principles formulated by the Baojia Office to facilitate the citizens and hopes that the citizens will strictly follow them. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Officials above the rank of Simplified Appointment in the current National Government, or members of the Central Executive Committee or Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, or their families, are exempt from fingerprint registration, but must fill out the resident certificate application form in the prescribed manner, affix their seal, and submit it to the Baojia Office of the Police Bureau with a letter, supporting documents, and two 2.5-inch half-length photos.</p>
<p>For ordinary citizens who have missed fingerprint registration, they must state the reason and apply to the Baojia Section after 4:30 PM every day to complete the procedures.</p>
<p>For civil servants who cannot come to register their fingerprints on time due to work reasons, they may apply to the Baojia Section to complete the procedures after 4:30 PM every day, or from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM on Saturday afternoons.</p>
<p>For pregnant women who are about to give birth or are in labor, they must apply to the Baojia Section to complete the fingerprint registration after being certified by the Baojia Chief in charge.</p>
<p>For disabled persons such as the blind or those with paralyzed legs, the Baojia Section will arrange for staff to go to their residence to complete the fingerprint registration procedures after being certified by the Baojia Chief in charge. In addition to the standard handling fee of five yuan, no other fees may be charged for completing the fingerprint registration procedures.</p>
<p>For gentry and celebrities who are well-versed in local public welfare undertakings and are recognized by society, as well as senior officials of the Municipal Government District Public Office and the Municipal Police Bureau, they may apply to the Baojia Section to consider sending staff to their residence to complete the fingerprint registration procedures. In addition to the standard handling fee of five yuan, no other fees may be charged.</p>
<h3>Well Digging Guide</h3>
<p>Well Location: A slightly elevated location should be selected, and there should be no unclean or filthy objects nearby (such as damaged sewers, dirty ponds, stables, latrines, and septic tanks).</p>
<p>Construction: The inner wall of the well must be paved with impermeable materials (such as bricks and cement) to the water surface or below, about fifteen to thirty feet from the ground. At the wellhead on the ground, a well curb about one foot high must be built, and the surrounding ground must also be paved with cement, with a radius of at least six feet, sloping outward from the foot of the well curb. The purpose is to prevent sewage from nearby ground from returning to the well without proper filtration.</p>
<p>Depth: The depth of an earthen well should be as deep as possible, but the minimum depth must reach more than fifteen feet underground to be safe.</p>
<p>Disinfection: When well water is used as drinking water, it must be boiled for a considerable amount of time, as this is the most reliable method of sterilization. In addition, it is best to disinfect well water with bleaching powder once a week. The method is as follows: (A) Calculate the volume of water in the well, i.e., (well radius × well radius × 3.1416 × water depth × 6.25), and the unit of the resulting number is gallons. (B) Dissolve five English ounces of bleaching powder in one gallon of purified water to form a solution. (C) Add two ounces of the solution described in item (B) to every 100 gallons of well water to achieve disinfection. Water is an indispensable drink for human beings, and it is of great importance to human health. If one is not careful and drinks it, one will get sick. It is hoped that those who dig and use wells will pay close attention to the above points.</p>

<h3>Teachers' Salaries Should Be Genuinely Improved; Education Seniors Express Opinions</h3>
<p>Recently, the cost of living in schools at all levels in this city has risen sharply. In order to take care of the livelihood of teachers and staff and the opening of schools, tuition fees for the next semester have been increased by about four times compared with the previous semester. The average tuition fee for middle schools is 5,000 yuan, so in the future, the treatment of teachers in schools in this city will have a large room for improvement. However, judging from the past situation, the funds of many schools are managed by the principal alone and are never made public. Therefore, how the treatment of teachers should be reasonably improved after the tuition fees have been increased fourfold is highly valued by all sectors of society. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited a senior figure in the education sector, who expressed the following opinions:</p>
<p>"The cost of living has risen sharply, and the increase in tuition fees in various schools is indeed a last resort to cope with the environment. After all, the increase in tuition fees will inevitably increase the number of students who drop out of school. This phenomenon is ultimately not a blessing for the country and society. Fortunately, all sectors of society are enthusiastic about rescuing students who have dropped out of school, which is of great benefit. However, the promotion of education is not only about rescuing students who have dropped out of school. If the lives of teachers are not stable, then there is still no hope for the future of education. Therefore, if the treatment of teachers is not reasonably improved after the increase in tuition fees, it will not only fail to consolidate the education cause, but also make the public enthusiastic, so attention can be paid to the teachers in each school in the next semester.</p>
<p>According to the current fees charged by various schools, the average middle school is 5,000 yuan. If the number of students in each class is 50, then the fee charged for each class is 250,000 yuan. According to the provisions of past education laws, in addition to 30% for school administrative expenses, 25% of 70% is for staff salaries, and the remainder should be used for teacher salaries. That is, of the 250,000 yuan, 131,200 yuan should be allocated for teacher salaries. If this number is divided into six months, then the monthly teacher salary is 21,800 yuan. If each month is counted as four weeks, then the weekly teacher salary is 5,460 yuan. According to the middle school curriculum standards, if each class is taught for 30 hours per week, then the teacher's salary should be reasonably at 180 yuan per hour. In Shanghai, many private schools only calculate the salary for each semester for five months, then according to the above situation, the teacher's salary per hour should be 218 yuan.</p>
<p>However, there are many schools in Shanghai, and the distribution of students may not be average. Moreover, it is not easy for some schools without the credentials to be trusted by the public to have 50 students in each class. However, during the war period, in order to save manpower and material resources, it is really necessary to consider merging schools with only 23 or only 10 to 20 students in each class for classes. Otherwise, it will only waste money, and the teachers will not be able to make a living, which will not benefit the public or the private sector. As for the school administrative expenses, 30% is taken out of the percentage. According to the above situation, each class is about 75,000 yuan. If a school has a total of six high and junior high school classes, the school administrative expenses for each semester will be 450,000 yuan. According to the current equipment situation of general schools, it does not seem to be a concern."</p>
