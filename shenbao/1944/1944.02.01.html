<h3>社評　歐局的新演變　從蘇波糾紛說起</h3>
<p>甲：在反軸心國大吹大擂的宣傳進攻歐陸之時，突然發生蘇波紛爭事件，且有僵待不决之勢，這對於今後歐洲的戰局和國際情勢會不會發生影響？</p>
<p>乙：眞的，道幾天一般人都會提到這個問題，並且還說對由蘇波糾紛而演變爲英美對蘇關係的問題，似乎成爲一九四四年頭國際大戰中饒有意義的一技插曲。可是，雖說是插曲，倒也使什麽大西洋憲章等等的表面文章自動抹上幾條墨槓子了！</p>
<p>甲：以爲蘇波糾紛是反軸心國家不和的表現之一嗎？</p>
<p>乙：怎麼不是呢？就蘇波糾紛問題而言，起因遠在五年前，即一九三九年第二次歐戰塲發之時，蘇聯利用時機，向波蘭進軍，奪取波蘭東部以及其他東歐地區，同時合併波羅的海沿岸愛、立、位三小國，恢復從前帝制俄羅斯的版圖，宣稱解放「西白俄羅斯」和「西烏克蘭」。不過這種舉動，立刻引起英美方面的反感，先有慫惡及協助芬蘭反蘇的事實，接着又在倫敦扶植波蘭流亡政權，積極進行反抗蘇聯的行動，並不因一九四一年六月德蘇戰爭之爆發而停止。不過後來德蘇戰爭日有進展，蘇聯失地一日千里，着着後退，蘇波問題才算應擱起來。</p>
<p>甲：那麼，爲什麽在莫期科德黑蘭會議之後，反軸心國宣傳英美蘇永遠合作之時，又會發生這次糾紛呢？</p>
<p>乙：從事實言，英美自德蘇戰爭以來，一直採取「坐山觀虎鬥」的政策，盡力使自己避免及减少戰爭的損害，同時希望德蘇兩國互相厮殺消耗至不堪再與英美搏鬥。在這種政策的施行過程中，當然需要相當的撫慰蘇聯，便勿生異心。支年歲尾的莫斯科會議和德黑蘭會議，都有這種憲義。什麽從戰略合作到戰後合作等等，不過是外交　令而已。然而，一方面由於德國戰略的新表現，另一方面由於蘇聯冬季攻勢的猛進，戰火已經進逼波蘇及羅蘇舊界，於是波蘭及巴爾幹問題又引起國際的注意，英美當然也不會不感到赤化西漸的危險，蘇波糾紛就是表現之一。</p>
<p>甲：原來如此，怪不得蘇聯的眞理報要傳出德英進行和平談判的謠言，向英美挑起神經戰來了。看來今後蘇聯英美問又有一幕幕的醜劇，等着在一九四四年排演了。可是，奇怪得很，自從眞理報刋布了這一謠言以後，英美的與論界反而出現了親蘇的論調！</p>
<p>乙：實在也沒有什麼特別奇怪！英美一面固然怕紅色恐怖深入歐睦，一面對歐洲唯一足以制服赤化的德國又不願斷然停止作戰，而他們本身又已百孔千瘡，罷工與內亂此伏彼起，結果還是不得不對史太林屈服吧！事件的趨勢，英美只會屈服，只有德國的堅强的士氣和無敵的防衛力，可以決定一切。</p>

<h3>軍會華北辦事處　整頓內部體制　予各部隊以充分供給</h3>
<p>北平卅一日中央社電　國府軍事委員會駐華北委員辦事處，自遷入中雨海迎春堂後，一切工作漸入正軌。日前該處遷移時，適委員胡毓坤上將因公赴濟南，現胡氏巳事畢返京，該處即於日內整備內部體制，擴充工作人員。其在南京及前方應行移京之各部門，即陸續遷來，並對駐在華北之國府各部隊，即開始搬運被服彈藥糧秣等項，予以充分之供給·預料各該部隊之剿匪工作，更將作有力展開</p>
<h3>德空軍大編隊　兩度襲倫敦　出動飛機共六百架</h3>
<p>柏林卅一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德機六百餘架曾參加廿八及廿九兩晚對倫敦之空襲，向預先指定之目標擲下各種重量不同之炸彈，此種聲勢浩大之德轟炸機大編隊，使英方防空部隊爲之驚詫失措，故德機損失甚微，兩夜損失僅廿五架。換言之，僅出動總數百分之四而已，德機參加此二次空襲者尚不止此數，蓋德軍戰報中曾謂尚有他處目標亦被轟炸，但未說明詳情。</p>
<p>柏林卅一日中央社電　昨據德軍界權威發表：前夜德强力空軍襲擊倫敦，歷時半小時，其間不斷向中心區投擲燃燒彈及炸彈。德機第一批於八時四十五分左右襲擊後，倫敦中心區發生大火多起。據參加此役之德空軍人員報告，英方夜戰機高射砲火及防禦氣球綱等防禦設施至為週密，但仍不能阻德機之進襲。</p>
<p>里期本三十一日中歐洲第二戰綫後，必將遭德軍之猛烈反擊，致最近發生多數恐懼戰爭之神經患者。頃據偷教來電，英當局爲對付萬一發生之事態，亦正努力强化本土防衛陣，廿九日並曾公佈防空之新指令，內容要點如次：從來從事一般補助防衛任務之根本防衛隊，今後均屬於高射砲隊，此項指令適用於英國全土。</p>
<h3>英靑年男女　登記服役</h3>

<p>里斯本卅一日中央社電　據倫敦每日郵報訊：英政府爲準備第二戰綫計，現正搜羅自十九至廿五歲之靑年婦女，入軍火廠工作，而不容彼等投入軍隊服役。據稱，第二戰綫計劃，使英國有更改其內國勞工組織之必要。同時據新訂法規，英海軍及陸戰隊不再收納志願兵，凡志願兵必須改入空軍或陸軍。</p>
<h3>英美機襲德　擊落逾百架　喪失空軍人員達千名</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日電　德國新聞社訊：德高射砲防空部隊，不顧惡劣之天氣情形，再度予襲擊德西南部之美恐怖飛機以重大之打擊。據迄今所有尙未完全之報吿，美機被擊落五十三架，其中包括飛行堡壘四十一架，受損之飛行保壘若十一架，企圖向瑞士方面逃逸，但為德捷速戰鬥機所追獲而加以擊落。在過去十二小時內，英美之恐怖空襲機至少損失一〇八架，其中大半爲四引擎式之轟炸機，飛行人員損失幾達一千人。</p>

<h3>天然色　照相技術　日人研究成功</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日本天然色照相技術之發明，業於日本富士膠卷公司之研究下完成，目下正逐步實現中。天然色照相爲歷年來世界各國所不斷研究者，大東亞戰爭爆發以前，德美兩國對此咸有相當成續，開戰以來，德美兩國之進步如何，惟不甚詳。然吾人相信該公司研究部所發明者，决不亞於該兩國。原來天然色照相，須分解三色始能完成，今祗須一枚膠卷而無須經分解三色，同時亦無須使用特殊機械，祇用普通照相機即能攝影。</p>
<h3>蘇幣制專家　已抵華盛頓</h3>
<p>日內瓦三十一日中央社電　據昨倫敦新聞紀事報息：關於戰後世界幣制政策，美不能獲取英政府之同意，現美財長莫根韜正與蘇聯協商採取一致行動·據稱：蘇聯銀行副總裁切基氏，昨日已抵華盛頓，開始商談，並悉，因英不願放棄凱賴氏計劃，而美亦不願放棄懷特氏計劃，兩國之協商遂至毫無結果。</p>
<h3>華北確立決戰體制　剿共戰兼有政治戰性質</h3>
<p>兵站要塞華北的建設戰，今與南太平洋的激烈戰局密切地聯繫着。從國府參戰，日本展開對華新政策，以至於中日同盟條約的締結，在中日關係的進展過程上，更加重了華北之爲兵站基地的任務。擊滅英美戰突入第三年的今日，華北豐富的地下資源與農產資源的開發，愈有决定的重要性。華北的建設，自今起應使成爲大東亞要塞的一大兵器庫，大糧秣廠。</p>
<p>中共的策略</p>
<p>最近中共以游擊戰的破壞建設來替代所謂「政治攻勢」，專事妨害培養日本戰力的華北建設，指令在華北全境破壞建設。</p>
<p>中共「政治攻勢」的主要目的，乃在妨害華北的對日貢獻與增產戰力資源。其所謂政洽攻勢的基本工作，第一，令優秀黨員接近新政權方面的軍人官吏，並使佯爲就職，傳播反戰思想，攪亂治安，故意作貪官污吏的行爲。第二，　線有關的經濟團體。商社。從事囤積，破壞低物價政策，妨害通貨等工作，企圖攪亂經濟。第三，妨書重要產業及交通機關，並送致襲擊的通牒，使在對日物資的增產增送上，造成障碍。第四，用食糧問題，工資問題誘致勞資問的糾紛，減低生產，使釀成人心的不安，而欲破壞華北的參戰體制。</p>
<p>食糧問題的新措置</p>
<p>對這中共的攻勢，華北在政治上與南京重行調整，設立國府軍事委員會華北辦事處，司法行政部華北辦事處，勢力使對中央的關係愈趨密切。更趁締結中日同盟條約的機會，改組華北政務委員會，刷新人事，確定國府在華北的領導地位，樹立和平政治力之劃時期的發展方策，以王克敏委員長，王蔭泰總務部長爲中心，實行强力政治，成爲華北建設的中樞。</p>
<p>華北剿共委員會為對中共鬥爭的根本，業已完成了凝集各省的保安隊，治安軍，新民會的總力，可以展開剿共工作的各種機構之整備。而在經濟方面，對食糧問題的措置，則動員華北食糧管理局，合作社，採運社的各組織，展開促進華北建設運動，規定各省，縣，市的責任收買量，傾注最大的努力於供給及收買工作上，同時並使與滿洲，華中的交易順利進行，一時頗見困窘的食糧問題，露出了一綫光明。</p>
<p>華北建設總樞的「華北開發公司」，跟着中國方面各種體制的準備，毅然改組華北戰時經濟、以適應决戰熊勢，華北交通機構亦大加改革，整備戰時運輸體制。</p>
<p>確立華北戰時經濟</p>
<p>這結果，在運日的大宗物資煤這一項中，本年上半期極為順利，達到本年度的增產計劃量。在鐵工業方面，擴充華北製鐵公司及其他原有設備、以擴大當地的生產，在本年度，能够根據日本的生產擴充計劃而大量供給的體制，正在迅速確立中。又航空决戰上必要的　鋁鑛礬土頁岩之開發，及以此爲原料之輕金屬工業的創設，亦已着手。在從南方運輸鋁精頗感困難的現狀下，聚集了日本化學工業之精粹，而得以無盡藏的開發鋁鑛，實現就地生奪，誠爲華北建設的凱歌。</p>
<p>如是，華北的建設從原料資源進入到工業的生產階段，完成了直接有益於决戰的體制。</p>
<p>華北軍的推進</p>
<p>然華北兵站要塞的基礎、是徹底剿共，剿共是華北捧默於大東亞戰的寶貴的血潮。是適應决戰態勢的先導。比起南方的苦戰來，華北的剿共戰兼有政治戰的特殊性質，不是一舉就可獻得偉大戰果的。但華北軍不忘推進大東亞戰决戰卜的任務，日本在南海正在擴大擊滅英美的戰局，在那决戰戰力的背後，華北的徹底剿共，與决戰資源的生產戰，乃欲確立大東亞防衛的鐵壁陣綫。（翔：譯自一月十九日西部每日新聞北京特電）</p>

<p>修改要點</p>

<p>轉口稅率與出口稅率均已先後修改，修改之要點，爲從量稅之廢除，進口稅率事同一律，故亦應廢除從量稅，惟進口稅之徵收，尚有關金單位，問題較複雜，經海關方面稅則家之研究，費時半年，始告元竣，現已呈由行政院核准，於二月一日起實行，其重要修改點如下：一，現行從量稅率，擬一　律暫改爲從價，分爲百分之五，百分之十，百分之十五，百分之二十，百分之二十五，百分之三十，百分之四十，百分之五十及百分之六十等九級差別稅率。二，現行按進口稅稅率徵　收之百分之五之水災附　加稅，及百分之五之關　稅附加稅，與進口從量　稅之百分之三十之臨時　附加稅，一槪免徵。三，從價徽稅之貨物，其完究稅價格，以輸入口岸之通用貨幣計算之，海關金單位即行廢止。四，進口紙烟及雪茄烟，　原由海關按照進口稅則　徵稅，而以五分之四稅　款爲統稅，現將所徽紙　烟及雪茄烟全部稅款作為關稅，幷依統稅稅率另徽統稅。</p>

<h3>市教育會清寒教育基金　周總裁慨捐十萬元</h3>

<h3>短評　合併以後</h3>
<p>本市第一八兩區公署，今日起合併爲第一區公署。自從去年八月一日租界接收以後，迄今半載，因爲行政系統依然兩個，在形式上公共與法租界的鴻溝雖已消滅，而實際感覺上，仍不免有彼此之分。今合併以後，行政系統趨於一元，租界的印象，無諭在形式上實質上都已消滅，對於整個大上海市的完成，對於盟邦的協力，當局的决意，是值得稱道的。</p>
<p>今後第一區範園，從經濟文化人口等等地位以觀，可說是上海市的中心，第一區內民生與市政問題的改善，足以發生模範作用，我們敬向當局提供意見兩點：</p>
<p>第一，從速建立全市民意機構，俾市民意見，得以溝通，作爲一切民生與市政問題改善的根據，惟有市民意見得能上達，民生問題才可切實改善。記得去年租界接收之時，陳市長曾表示數個月後成立民意機構，目前已屆急需成立的時候了。</p>
<p>第二，盟邦僑民獨多是第一區的特殊情形，爲進一步取得密切協調建設大上海市，盟邦僑民的意見，也有盡量溝通之必要。因此，應與明邦僑民領袖不斷接觸，舉行如懇談性質之定期集會，聽取意見，同時，常局施政之目標與意義，也可藉以使日僑瞭解，絕無隔閡。</p>
<p>總之，爲建設上海市前途着想，設立民意機構，溝通政府與人民意見，打成一片，共同協力，已爲不得或緩之舉了。</p>

<h3>評言　建設公價</h3>
<p>我們以前說過，建設就是生產，生產就是建設，建設公債發行的最終目標，就是在於協助推進戰時的生產。在平時，國家的生產擴充資金，可以從外國借債，但在戰時，這筆資金，祗有在國內籌措，其辦法不外於完納租稅與消化公債兩途。比較起來，兩個辦法之中，又以徵稅爲穩健於發行公債，因爲發行公債而消化成績欠佳，則其結果將等於紙幣的增發。</p>
<p>國府爲謀建設事業之進展，决定發行建設公債六萬萬元，指定作爲浚墾淤淺湖沼，洽理運河，振興農田水利及其他建設事業之用，其發行辦法，聞在基本原則上，交由中儲銀行承受或募集，其承受部份，並得轉售。自原則言，鉅額公債，似宜先由人民消化，不宜先由銀行承購，以免通貨增發之可能，可是，由於事實上之困難，自然祗好出此一途，那末，是適切的方法，就算如由金融機關推進儲蓄，以謀消化公債。例如盟邦日本，在昭和十三年度以至十七年度的五年期間，有七百億圓的儲蓄，而國債消化了其發行總額的八八·五，即三百八十五億八千萬圓，同時，並消化了其國內外事業設備資金二百八十六億圓，對滿投資七十五億圓，都是屬於發行公債方式的。這是戰時儲蓄協助消化公債的一個顯例，我們亟當刻意取法，俾得一面協助國家生產，一面節約人民消費，眞所謂一舉而兩得了！</p>

<h3>海軍　岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯　軍人班（五）</h3>
<p>隆夫近來也開始努力用功了。雖然數學的功課，不像眞人那麽好，但是日文·漢文·圖畫等成績都在眞人以上。英語也不在眞人之下</p>
<p>那年的暑假，對軍人班的人們，好像是沒有關係的。隆夫也整天地不離開書桌。這樣倒使父母擔憂起來了。</p>
<p>有一個海風凉爽，月色皎潔的晚上。隆夫依舊在電燈光下，翻閱着小字的辭典。</p>
<p>「到外邊去玩一下吧」！他母親很擔心地這樣說着。</p>
<p>隆夫雖然勉强到外邊散步去了，但只是一個人覺得很沒有意思的，所以又去打夥眞人了。眞人好像也在用功，但因為隆夫來了，便很爽快的應諾了。兩人一同走向天保山海演去。途中街坊上，都點着地方遺俗的六月燈。在那舊式的蓬花燈籠上，畫着美麗的畫圖，被凉風吹動着。</p>
<p>「好美麗的風景啊！」到了海演，隆夫也將考試的問題，忘到腦後去了。常看慣了的櫻鳥，被藍紫色的晚靈籠罩着，海上月光冲淡，微漾的波紋，散放着銀色的光輝。</p>
<p>「我近來向櫻島，練習喊號令——將來作軍官時用的。「眞人近來也公然說着這樣的談話。</p>
<p>「做一下看看！」隆夫這樣催促着。</p>
<p>「聽着吧！…向前開…步…走」使盡了力氣，這樣喊着。聲音總不能如意地發出來，這種奇怪的聲音，是不會達到櫻島。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈，確實聰不得。第一，海軍士官，是不會發那種號令的。你呌軍艦『向前』他是不會前進的。必須要喊「兩舷前進微速！」這樣的號令」隆夫的海軍知識也是不可靠的，但是較眞人確似略勝一籌。</p>
<p>被隆夫椰揄了的眞人，這回開始向隆夫挑戰角力。</p>
<p>「來！……二人在冰凉的濕砂灘上，開始角力了。這回眞人終於勝利了，隆夫連敗了三次。</p>
<p>二人相對笑着，疲倦了的身體躺在砂灘上。凉爽的夜風，吹遍了海灘上，十三日夜裏的圓月，映照着眞人雪白的肌膚。</p>
<p>「這倒奇怪啊！一隆夫手指着皎潔的明月說道。「眞人！你看看月亮，是三個？是四個呢？」</p>
<p>「胡說，月亮是沒有複數的。」</p>
<p>「那麼，我怎這樣看見！。這究是怎麼回事呢」？隆夫的聲音，特別失望似的。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>過了兩三天以後，眞人的家裏，來了一位新奇的客人，就是隆夫的妹妹。她對眞人說，「我哥哥很抱悲觀的，請您到我家裏來玩玩好麽？」</p>
<p>今年剛十四歲，身裁高大的她，口音淸楚好像大人一樣。在柔順的薩摩女子羣中，她確是一個奇特的女子。雖然是一個少女，但是她的睥氣是很倔强的，有時候還勇敢地向父母爭論。在這年春天，入女學校的時候，變親都布望她入縣立高女，但她自己却主張入在鹿兒島長時髦的聚母女學院，並且終於進了那個學校。那個舊敎的女學校，是設立在遠處的小山上，即使在雨天上學困難的時候，因為是自己所喜歡，自己所選擇的學校，所以也要勉强的上學校去的。若說她是一個薩縻女子，倒不如說她有隆摩男兒的氣質。</p>
<p>人倒反通紅著臉，這樣回答著。「睛您就來吧人倒反通紅着臉，這樣回答着。「請您就來吧！我實在很担心！」她的意思，是態同眞人一塊兒回到她的家裏。這可使不得！一個靑年和一個少女，一塊兒在街上走着，那確是違反當地風俗的。</p>
<p>「請您先回去吧！」</p>
<p>「爲甚麽？」</p>
<p>「不為甚麼……」</p>
<p>眞人通紅着臉兒，話也說不出來了。校子凝視着眞人的臉。</p>
<p>「沒用的東西！」她一邊說着一邊搖着她那分開的頭髮回去了。」</p>
<p>又過了三十分鐘的工夫，眞人靜悄悄地從門口進去，穿過庭院，到隆夫的屋裏來了·你怎麼拿？」</p>
<p>「眞人……因為醫生說我是近視眼。」</p>
<p>隆夫像吐東西似的說着，將頭低下去了。</p>
<p>當海軍軍官，要是眼睛不好，乃是致命的打擊。隆夫的悲觀也並不是沒有原因的。</p>
<p>「那麼……，還是初期吧。若帶上眼鏡，便可以無事了。」</p>
<p>「不然，若是帶眼鏡，便越發的近視了·」那麽到海邊去，練習往遠處看。什麽霧島山，開聞獄……都可以的」</p>
<p>兵學校的體格考試，雖然已經迫近前了，但是只要努力，不一定是不會好的——</p>
<p>從那天以後，二人每天站在海岸上，向着遠方的高千穗山峰，和那背面的薩縻富士，注目看着。芳是近地方的風景進入眼廉的時候，便慌忙地將眼睛閉上了。眞人雖然不過是同他作伴，但是使好的眼睛更好起來，也並不是無、意義的事。</p>

<h3>慨捐獎學金　幫助貧苦同學　一位小朋友熱忱可嘉</h3>
<p>編者先生：上次參觀貴館所辦的國民常職展覽會的時候，看見許多小朋友正在排隊索取助學金登記表。我的父親說：「這些小朋友們成績都是很好的，不過家裏都很貧苦，沒有錢繳付學費，所以都到申報館裏來申請帮助，這是很好的事，我們有錢的時候，也應該捐助的」。我聽了道話就記在心裏</p>
<p>我今年是九歲了，在天後宮裏秋四年級讀書，道次學期考試因為我平常沒有缺課，努力讀書，所以考得第一名，同時得到獎學金三百四十元。我就想起從前的話，向我的父親說將這次的獎學金捐給申報館作為助學金。父親和母親都非常贊成，現在就將這三百四十元錢送上，請代為轉給貧苦的讀書小朋友們。戚康男</p>

        <h1>1944.02.01</h1>
<h3>Editorial: New Developments in the European Situation - Starting with the Soviet-Polish Dispute</h3>
<p>A: At a time when anti-Axis propaganda was loudly trumpeting an offensive on the European continent, the sudden Soviet-Polish dispute arose, and it seems to be in a stalemate. Will this have an impact on the future European war and the international situation?</p>
<p>B: Indeed, most people have been talking about this issue these past few days, and some even say that the evolution of the Soviet-Polish dispute into a problem of Anglo-American relations with the Soviet Union seems to be a significant interlude in the international war of 1944. However, even though it is just an interlude, it automatically sullies the superficial articles of the Atlantic Charter and other such documents!</p>
<p>A: Do you think the Soviet-Polish dispute is one of the manifestations of discord among the anti-Axis nations?</p>
<p>B: How could it not be? As far as the Soviet-Polish dispute is concerned, its origins lie as far back as five years ago, when the Second European War broke out in 1939. The Soviet Union seized the opportunity to advance into Poland, seizing eastern Poland and other Eastern European regions, while annexing the three small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, restoring the former territory of Imperial Russia, and declaring the liberation of "West Belarus" and "West Ukraine." However, this action immediately aroused resentment from the British and Americans, who first engaged in instigating and assisting Finland's anti-Soviet actions, and then supported the Polish government-in-exile in London, actively carrying out anti-Soviet activities, which did not stop even after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war in June 1941. However, as the German-Soviet war progressed and the Soviet Union lost territory at a rapid pace, the Soviet-Polish issue was put on hold.</p>
<p>A: Then why did this dispute arise again after the Moscow and Tehran Conferences, when the anti-Axis nations were promoting the idea of eternal cooperation between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union?</p>
<p>B: Frankly speaking, since the German-Soviet war, Britain and America have been adopting a policy of "sitting on the mountain to watch the tigers fight," trying their best to avoid and reduce the damage of the war, while hoping that Germany and the Soviet Union would kill and exhaust each other until they were unable to fight Britain and America any further. In the process of implementing this policy, it was of course necessary to appease the Soviet Union to prevent it from developing ulterior motives. The Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference at the end of the year both had this meaning. Talk of strategic cooperation to post-war cooperation, etc., is just diplomatic etiquette. However, on the one hand, due to the new manifestations of German strategy, and on the other hand, due to the rapid advance of the Soviet winter offensive, the flames of war have approached the old borders between Poland and the Soviet Union and Romania and the Soviet Union. As a result, the Polish and Balkan issues have once again attracted international attention, and Britain and America will certainly not fail to feel the danger of westward expansion of communism. The Soviet-Polish dispute is one of its manifestations.</p>
<p>A: I see. No wonder the Soviet Union's Pravda spread rumors of peace talks between Germany and Britain to provoke a nerve war with Britain and America. It seems that in the future, there will be one ugly drama after another between the Soviet Union, Britain, and America, waiting to be staged in 1944. However, it is very strange that since Pravda published this rumor, pro-Soviet arguments have appeared in British and American public opinion circles!</p>
<p>B: There is really nothing particularly strange about it! On the one hand, Britain and America are afraid of the red terror penetrating Europe, and on the other hand, they are unwilling to decisively stop fighting against Germany, the only country in Europe capable of subduing communism, and they themselves are already riddled with holes, with strikes and internal strife rising one after another. In the end, they have no choice but to yield to Stalin! The trend of events is that Britain and America will only yield. Only Germany's strong morale and invincible defensive capabilities can decide everything.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Marshall Islands - Japanese Army and Navy Intercept and Strike - Enemy Positions in the Solomon Islands and Other Places Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 31st: Enemy troops attacked the Marshall Islands on the morning of January 30th and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Japanese army and naval units in the area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - The most powerful enemy aircraft force attacked the Mapiiru Islands. The Japanese army and navy in the area immediately intercepted and are now engaged in fierce fighting. From this, it can be seen that the enemy has started a new offensive against the Marshall Islands. Although details of the battle situation are not yet clear, the enemy has mobilized a powerful mobile force, and its offensive must be of considerable scale. We believe that the Japanese army and navy units, with their spirit of vowing to kill the enemy and the solid confidence of the people, will surely reap alarming results, and there will be good news coming soon. Furthermore, the cumulative number of enemy aircraft that have attacked the Marshall Islands this year has reached 344.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese base in the Pacific, the enemy's trend of attacking Madang in New Guinea has become increasingly active, and they have even carried out air raids on Madang and Wewak. On the afternoon of the 27th, 18 P-48 aircraft attacked the Musa area and two were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval aircraft squadrons carried out fierce bombing raids on enemy positions in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea from the morning of the 29th to the evening of the same day. The battle situation is as follows: At dawn on the 29th, a surprise attack was launched on the enemy airfield and land positions in Torokina on Bougainville Island, causing two fires. At dawn on the same day, an attack was launched on enemy transport ships in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea, and the enemy party facilities, coastal boat groups, and nearby small islands in the Mausoleum area of New Britain Island were also bombed, causing the enemy's military facilities to catch fire, boats to be destroyed, and cargo handling facilities on various small islands to also catch fire. In the afternoon, a sudden attack was launched on the enemy's ground positions in the Port Moresby area of the island, and at night, an attack was launched on the enemy airfield at the southeastern end of New Georgia Island, destroying its military facilities. All aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air units heavily bombed the enemy's positions and landing points in Tsirubu, New Britain Island, on the afternoon of the 29th, causing several fires. Japanese aircraft safely returned to their base.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval aircraft attacked the enemy's army in Makas on the morning of the 29th, and bombs hit the enemy's barracks, causing a fire. All Japanese aircraft returned to base.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Operations of the North China Development Company and Other Organizations - Minister Aoki Answers Questions from Diet Members</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the North China Development Bill Committee in the House of Representatives on the 31st, Representative Ashida Hitoshi asked about the future direction of the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied as follows: After the outbreak of the China Incident, both companies began active operations, first entrusting the task of investing in construction and control to various business companies. After the implementation of the new policy, they also cooperated with great enthusiasm in strengthening combat power and replenishing materials in China. Japan must also follow China's wishes and research and, as much as possible, allow China to manage joint ventures between China and Japan. The Central China Silk Company and the Central China Supervisory Company are examples of this. Therefore, the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company must also adapt to the new situation and reform their organizations and operations. As for the local control companies, they should also be controlled as appropriate, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the House of Representatives North China Development Company Amendment Bill Committee on the 31st, Representative Ono Yu questioned the implementation of Japan's policy toward China and the relationship between China and Japan. Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry replied, stating in essence that the spirit of the new policy toward China is to eliminate the remnants of Britain and America and to aim for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The purpose of abolishing extraterritoriality and transferring taxation rights is to eradicate British and American-style oppression and cooperate with China's free development, thereby further strengthening the relationship between China and Japan. Since the implementation of the new policy, the Chinese side has also been very active and has further doubled its cooperation with Japan. Since the two countries now have this kind of relationship, all our expatriates must serve the motherland and work harder for China.</p>

<h3>Four German Generals Defending the Fortress of Europe</h3>
<p>German newspapers published on January 14: Marshal Kesselring is active as Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Atlantic. When Badoglio betrayed and German troops entered Italy, Marshal Kesselring served as Commander of the Southern Army in Italy, taking on the heavy task of preventing the anti-Axis forces from advancing. After Marshal Rommel recovered from his illness, he made a comeback and was appointed as Commander of the Northern Army in Italy. After that, Marshal Rommel inspected the defenses of Europe under the order of Führer Hitler. At the end of November last year, he patrolled Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Marshal Kesselring, who established a great achievement in blocking the offensive of the anti-Axis forces on the Italian front, was appointed as Commander-in-Chief, responsible for the coastal defenses from northern Austria to the Mediterranean coast of France. Before the anti-Axis forces opened the Second Front, the German army stationed General Wöhler in the Balkans, Marshal Kesselring in Southwestern Europe, and General Renthke in the Atlantic coast, and then used Marshal Rommel as a mobile force to deploy an impenetrable and solid front line, coupled with a substantial air force and high morale, preparing to intercept and annihilate the anti-Axis forces.

<p>Rome, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a broadcast by the Italian radio station, Italian Chairman Mussolini summoned the generals of the army to the military headquarters on the 30th for instructions. The content is as follows: Since Badoglio's betrayal, the entire Italian army, navy, and air force seemed to have been on the verge of collapse, but the fact is quite the opposite. By the end of September, we had rebuilt the national army. The landing of the Anglo-American forces in Anzio had a significant impact on the morale of our people, but in order to defend our capital Rome, we really cannot stand idly by, let alone have a psychology of surrender. Our army is stronger than ever before, and we must fight alongside our allied nation Germany again. The cooperation between the Italian and German armies on the battlefield is imminent, and we must let our allied German army know how genuine the friendship of its allies is.</p>

He hoped that the new Italian army would not repeat the mistakes of the old army under any circumstances. Mussolini continued to mention the oath that the generals should take, believing that this oath is not only a guarantee of loyalty to the republic, but also a manifestation of the new spirit. All those who take the oath should break all ties with the past. Mussolini also said that the only purpose of the new army is to be able to fight alongside the German army again. He finally praised the German army's war record.</p>

<h3>Capital Students' Narcotics Eradication Corps Uncovers White Powder Organization - Seized Narcotics All Burned</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - The young students of the capital believe that the narcotics eradication movement is of great importance and significance to the cause of saving China and protecting East Asia.

Together with the military police, they all lined up yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM and launched a sudden attack on the White Powder Headquarters on Fengfu Road in the capital and its gang's lair. Strict plans were made before the operation, so the work was orderly. When the large team arrived at its destination, the Liquidation Work Team and the Ganzi Life Camp implemented a blockade of traffic, and the assault teams immediately cooperated with the military police to carry out the mission. The arrangements here were all very secret, and after a long search, nothing conclusive was found.

The massive scale of this German bomber formation surprised and overwhelmed the British air defenses, resulting in minimal losses for the German aircraft.

<h3>Natural Color Photography Technology Successfully Developed by Japanese</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The invention of Japanese natural color photography technology has been completed by the research department of the Fuji Film Company of Japan, and is currently being gradually implemented. Natural color photography has been the subject of continuous research in various countries around the world for many years. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, both Germany and the United States had made considerable progress in this area, but the extent of their advancements since the war began is unknown. However, we believe that the invention made by the company's research department is no less significant than those of the two countries. Originally, natural color photography required the separation of three colors to be completed, but now only one roll of film is needed, and there is no need to separate the three colors. At the same time, no special equipment is required; ordinary cameras can be used for photography.</p>
<h3>Soviet Monetary Expert Arrives in Washington</h3>

It is understood that negotiations between the two countries have reached an impasse because Britain is unwilling to abandon the Keynes Plan, and the United States is unwilling to abandon the White Plan.</p>
<h3>North China Establishes Decisive Battle System - Communist Suppression Combines Military and Political Warfare</h3>
<p>The construction war of North China, a vital military base, is now closely linked to the fierce battles in the South Pacific. From the National Government's participation in the war to Japan's unfolding of a new policy towards China, and finally to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, North China's role as a military base has been further emphasized in the process of Sino-Japanese relations. As we enter the third year of the war to crush Britain and America, the development of North China's abundant underground and agricultural resources is becoming increasingly important. From now on, the construction of North China should transform it into a major arsenal and granary for the Greater East Asia war effort.</p>
<p>The CCP's Strategy</p>
<p>Recently, the CCP has replaced its so-called "political offensive" with guerrilla warfare to disrupt construction, focusing on hindering North China's construction that strengthens Japan's war effort, directing destruction throughout North China.</p>
<p>The CCP's "political offensive" aims primarily to impede North China's contribution to Japan and its ability to increase war resource production. The fundamental tasks of its so-called political offensive are: First, to have outstanding party members approach military officers and officials in the new regime, feigning employment, spreading anti-war ideology, disrupting security, and deliberately engaging in corrupt and unethical behavior. Second, to infiltrate economic groups and trading companies connected to the front lines, engaging in hoarding, disrupting low-price policies, and hindering currency circulation, in an attempt to destabilize the economy. Third, to obstruct important industries and transportation facilities, issuing threats of attacks, creating obstacles to the increased production and delivery of materials to Japan. Fourth, to incite labor-management disputes using food and wage issues, reducing production and creating public unrest, with the aim of undermining North China's war participation system.</p>
<p>New Measures for the Food Problem</p>
<p>In response to the CCP's offensive, North China is politically realigning with Nanjing, establishing the North China Office of the National Government's Military Affairs Commission and the North China Office of the Ministry of Justice and Administration, increasingly strengthening its ties with the central government. Furthermore, taking the opportunity of the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, the North China Political Affairs Commission is being reorganized, personnel are being refreshed, and the National Government's leadership in North China is being affirmed, establishing a groundbreaking strategy for the development of peaceful political power. With Chairman Wang Kemin and Chief Secretary Wang Yintai at the center, strong governance is being implemented, becoming the central hub of North China's construction.</p>
<p>The North China Communist Suppression Committee, as the foundation for the struggle against the CCP, has completed the consolidation of the security forces, peacekeeping troops, and New People's Society from various provinces, preparing various institutions to launch communist suppression efforts. In the economic sphere, regarding measures for the food problem, the North China Food Administration, cooperative societies, and purchasing and transportation companies are being mobilized to promote the North China Construction Movement. The responsible purchasing quantity for each province, county, and city is being specified, and the utmost effort is being devoted to supply and procurement. Simultaneously, smooth trade with Manchuria and Central China is being facilitated, and the food problem, which was once quite dire, is showing signs of improvement.</p>
<p>The "North China Development Company," the central hub for North China's construction, is resolutely reorganizing North China's wartime economy to adapt to the decisive battle situation, following the preparation of various systems in China. North China's transportation infrastructure is also being greatly reformed, preparing the wartime transportation system.</p>
<p>Establishing North China's Wartime Economy</p>
<p>As a result, in the area of coal, a major material transported to Japan, the first half of this year has been extremely smooth, achieving the annual production plan. In the iron industry, the North China Iron and Steel Company and other existing facilities are being expanded to increase local production. This year, a system capable of supplying large quantities according to Japan's production expansion plan is being rapidly established. Furthermore, the development of bauxite shale, essential for air combat, and the establishment of a light metal industry using these raw materials are also underway. In the current situation where the transportation of alumina from the south is quite difficult, the essence of Japan's chemical industry has been gathered to exploit the inexhaustible bauxite deposits and achieve local production, truly a triumph for North China's construction.</p>
<p>Thus, North China's construction has moved from the raw material resource stage to the industrial production stage, completing a system directly beneficial to the decisive battle.</p>
<p>The Advancement of the North China Army</p>
<p>However, the foundation of North China's military base is the thorough suppression of the communists. Communist suppression is North China offering a valuable stream of blood to the Greater East Asia War. It is the vanguard of adapting to the decisive battle posture. Compared to the difficult battles in the south, the communist suppression war in North China has a special nature that combines political warfare. Great results cannot be achieved at once. But the North China Army does not forget its mission to advance the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. While Japan is expanding its battle to crush Britain and America in the South Seas, behind that decisive battle power, North China's thorough communist suppression and the production war of decisive battle resources aim to establish an iron wall of defense for Greater East Asia.

<h3>The Eight District Public Office Will Be Abolished Today - Merged into the First District Public Office - Important Internal Personnel Choices Have Been Decided</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city were established on the day of receiving the two concessions last August. It has been half a year since then. Mayor Chen, in order to unify Shanghai's municipal administration and eliminate the administrative boundaries of the former concessions, has decided, after several consultations with relevant parties, to abolish the Eighth District Public Office and merge it with the First District Public Office today (February 1st). The new First District Public Office has undergone appropriate adjustments in terms of organization and personnel to better align with China's administrative system. For example, the administrative meetings and personnel meetings that followed the old Municipal Council system of the former Public Concession have been ordered to be abolished. In the future, decisions on various administrative matters will be made through council meetings. Since receiving the concessions, all department heads of the First District Public Office, except for the Finance and Public Works Departments, have been Chinese. After this merger, Chinese personnel will also be appointed as heads of the Finance and Public Works Departments. All general affairs section chiefs of each department will be replaced with Chinese personnel. Some foreign employees, besides those who resign, will be transferred to positions such as commissioners and technical experts. After the merger of the two districts, the original Finance Department will be reorganized into three departments: the Finance Department, the Accounting Department, and the District Treasury. The Social Welfare Department of the Eighth District Public Office will be abolished. The Social Welfare Department of the First District Public Office will be renamed the Industrial Investigation Department, and the original social welfare affairs will be handled by the Municipal Government's Social Welfare Bureau. The fire departments of the First and Eighth Districts will be transferred to the First Police Bureau. The education departments of the First and Eighth Districts will be abolished.</p>
<p>List of Senior Personnel</p>
<p>The list of senior personnel of the First District Public Office, from the Director onward, is as follows: Director of the First District Public Office: Mayor Chen (concurrent); Chief Secretary: Wu Songdao; Appointed Secretary: Takase Den; Simplified Secretary: Gu Jiwu; Director of the General Affairs Department: Sun Lifu; Deputy Director: Noguchi Kinjiro; Deputy Director: Wu Yiyi; Director of the Finance Department: Yuan Houzhi (concurrent); Advisor to the National Economic Commission stationed at the First District Public Office: Hibino Noboru; Deputy Director: Lin Zhefu; Director of the Accounting Department: Dai De (concurrent); Deputy Director: Fukuyama Fujinan; Director of the Treasury: Pan Shiju; Deputy Director: Wang Shu; Director of the Public Works Department: Zhang Enlin (concurrent); Deputy Director: Xu Guansan; Chief Engineer (temporarily concurrent Deputy Director): Jiang Shoubaoping; Director of the Economic Department: Feng You; Deputy Director: Hirano Osamu; Deputy Director: Dai Linzao; Director of the Health Department: Yuan Junchang (concurrent); Deputy Director: Nagai Isamu; Counselor: Tashiro Yoshiaki; Director of the Industrial Investigation Department: Ling Xianwen; Deputy Director: Ando Jiro.

<p>Mayor's Remarks</p>
<p>On August 1st of last year, I was ordered to receive the administration of the Public Concession and the French Concession in this city. I immediately established the First and Eighth District Public Offices to separately manage the administration of the two districts. This was a temporary expedient considering the needs of the time. In order to unify Shanghai's municipal administration and eliminate the administrative boundaries of the former concessions, it was necessary to merge the First and Eighth Districts as soon as possible. It has been half a year since the reception of the former concessions. During this period, we have been engaged in renewing administration and gradually improving the existing system. Now, this work has been successfully completed through the efforts of all parties. Therefore, it has been decided to merge the Eighth District into the First District on February 1st, and to make appropriate adjustments to the administrative system and personnel of the First District Public Office in order to align it with China's administrative system as much as possible. From this day forward, the Eighth District Public Office will be abolished, and the responsible persons have been designated to handle the transfer of its departments. The Eighth District was in charge of all the administrative facilities of the former French Concession, especially the tax rates, etc., which were originally not entirely the same as those of the First District. After merging with the First District Public Office, they should be reorganized according to their nature, simplified under the principle of unification, so as to benefit the citizens. Recalling the reception of the concessions, I am deeply impressed by the cooperation given by all related parties of the Allied nations and all sectors of this city. I am deeply grateful for their deep support for this merger of the two districts. In the future, the construction of Greater Shanghai will be gradually implemented in accordance with the established policy. I sincerely hope that all related parties will continue to assist us in order to jointly complete this great mission.</p>

<h3>The Haikwan Tael Unit Will Be Abolished Today - Import Tariff Rates Have Also Been Revised</h3>
<p>In order to increase tax revenue, the customs authorities have been ordered to revise the current import tariff rules, effective February 1st. Merchants should inquire with the Appraisal Section of the customs for all detailed information.</p>
<p>Key Points of the Revision</p>
<p>The Director of the Customs Administration, Mr. Zhang Sumin, explained the revision of import tariff rates as follows:</p>
<p>Transshipment and export tariff rates have already been revised one after another. The key point of the revision is the abolition of specific duties. Since import tariff rates are the same, specific duties should also be abolished. However, the collection of import tariffs is still related to the Haikwan Tael unit, which is a more complicated issue. After half a year of research by customs tariff experts, it was finally completed and has now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It will be implemented on February 1st. The important revisions are as follows: 1. The current specific duties are temporarily converted into ad valorem duties, divided into nine levels of differential tariff rates: 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60%. 2. The 5% flood relief surcharge and the 5% customs surcharge currently levied based on the import tariff rate, as well as the 30% temporary surcharge on import specific duties, will be waived. 3. For goods subject to ad valorem tariffs, the duty-paying value shall be calculated in the common currency of the port of entry, and the Haikwan Tael unit will be abolished. 4. Imported cigarettes and cigars, which were originally taxed by customs according to the import tariff rules, with four-fifths of the tax revenue being used as consolidated tax, will now have all the tax revenue from cigarettes and cigars collected as customs duty and consolidated tax will be levied separately according to the consolidated tax rate.</p>

It was resolved at the first meeting that each district would be responsible for assisting in the investigation of idle and abandoned land within its jurisdiction, and that the investigation should be completed by the end of February and submitted to the team for review. According to reporters inquiring with the Fourth District Public Office, the district office has ordered its subordinate towns to actively investigate all idle and abandoned land within their jurisdiction, and has issued a survey form instructing investigators to fill in detailed information regarding the name of the abandoned land, its location, the name of the owner, the nature of the soil, the appropriate crops to plant, the reason for the land being idle and abandoned, countermeasures to promote cultivation, the year and month the land became idle and abandoned, and a plan.</p>
<h3>60th Period Household Flour Sale Extended by Six Days</h3>
<p>The sale of household flour for the 60th period, originally scheduled to end on January 30th, has been extended to February 5th by order of the authorities to the rice merchants. The rice merchants, fearing that the public may not be aware of the true situation, have issued notices stating: "By order of the First District Public Office, the sale of household flour for the 60th period has been extended to February 5th." The issuance of rice and flour for this period coincided with the Lunar New Year, and the 25th, 26th, and 27th of last month were closed for three days as usual. It was unavoidable that some residents did not have time to purchase their rations. This extension may be one of the main reasons.</p>

<h3>Short Commentary: After the Merger</h3>
<p>The First and Eighth District Public Offices of this city will be merged into the First District Public Office starting today. Since the reception of the concessions on August 1st of last year, it has been half a year. Because the administrative systems remained separate, the gap between the Public and French Concessions, although eliminated in form, still inevitably existed in practice. With the merger now, the administrative systems are becoming unified, and the impression of the concessions, both in form and substance, has been eliminated. The authorities' determination to complete the entire city of Greater Shanghai and to cooperate with the Allied nations is commendable.</p>
<p>In the future, the First District, in terms of economy, culture, population, and other aspects, can be said to be the center of Shanghai. Improvements in the livelihood of the people and municipal administration in the First District can serve as a model. We respectfully offer two suggestions to the authorities:</p>
<p>First, establish a municipal public opinion body as soon as possible so that the opinions of the citizens can be communicated and serve as a basis for improving all livelihood and municipal administration issues. Only when the opinions of the citizens can reach the top can livelihood issues be effectively improved. We remember that Mayor Chen expressed the intention to establish a public opinion body a few months after the reception of the concessions last year. It is now time to establish it urgently.</p>
<p>Second, the unique situation of the First District is that there are many Allied nationals. To further achieve close coordination in building Greater Shanghai, it is also necessary to communicate the opinions of the Allied nationals as much as possible. Therefore, continuous contact should be maintained with the leaders of the Allied nationals, holding regular meetings of a discussion nature to listen to their opinions. At the same time, the goals and significance of the authorities' policies can also be used to make the Japanese understand them, ensuring that there is no division.</p>
<p>In short, for the sake of building the future of Shanghai, establishing a public opinion body, communicating the opinions of the government and the people, and working together in harmony have become actions that cannot be delayed or postponed.</p>

In the B group, Ling You overcame Tian Tian 45-30, and Yan Team defeated Hei Shan 36-19. In the first game of the A group, Da Hua played against San Lun in a battle to avoid finishing last.

In the main event, Hua Lian faced Ren Yu. Hua Lian's morale was high, while Ren Yu's spirit was scattered. Hua Lian won 42-30. Yu Xuanzi of Ren Yu scored the opening record with a long shot. Hua Lian did not want to be outdone. Zhang Jinxuan scored, and Wu Chengzhang scored four consecutive points. In the first half, Hua Lian led 11-10. After changing sides, Zhuo Guorong of Ren Yu left the field after four fouls, and his courage weakened. Zhang Liangxiong, Zhai Xilin, and Kong Guangyi of Hua Lian scored as if shooting beads, and the score rose sharply. As a result, Hua Lian won 42-30. With the threat removed, Hua Lian's future is even more promising.</p>

<h3>Commentary: Construction Bonds</h3>
<p>We have said before that construction is production, and production is construction. The ultimate goal of issuing construction bonds is to help promote wartime production. In peacetime, the country's production expansion funds can be borrowed from foreign countries, but in wartime, this fund can only be raised domestically, and the methods are nothing more than paying taxes and absorbing bonds. Comparatively speaking, among the two methods, taxation is more stable than issuing bonds, because if the absorption performance of issuing bonds is not good, the result will be equivalent to the increase in banknotes.</p>
<p>In order to promote the progress of construction projects, the National Government has decided to issue construction bonds of 600 million yuan, designated for dredging shallow lakes and swamps, managing canals, revitalizing farmland water conservancy, and other construction projects. According to reports, the issuance method, in principle, will be undertaken or raised by the Central Reserve Bank, and the undertaken part may be resold. In principle, large bonds should be digested by the people first, not purchased by banks first, to avoid the possibility of currency issuance. However, due to practical difficulties, this is naturally the only way out. In that case, the appropriate method would be for financial institutions to promote savings in order to digest bonds. For example, in the Allied country Japan, during the five-year period from Showa 13 to Showa 17, there were 70 billion yen in savings, and national debt absorbed 88.5% of its total issuance, that is, 38.58 billion yen. At the same time, it also absorbed 28.6 billion yen in domestic and foreign business equipment funds and 7.5 billion yen invested in Manchuria, all of which belonged to the method of issuing bonds. This is a clear example of wartime savings assisting in the digestion of bonds. We must deliberately learn from it so that we can help national production on the one hand and save people's consumption on the other, which is truly killing two birds with one stone!</p>
<h3>After Listing of Various Exchange Draft Banks: Restore Lending and Increase Lending Interest Rates to Eliminate Speculation</h3>
<p>After the listing of the Exchange Draft Banks, members of the Shanghai Money Shops Association have resumed lending to various industries, all in accordance with the loan restriction methods issued by the Silver Money Industry Association and the Ministry of Finance. Mortgage loans are based on the principle of not promoting speculation and hoarding. The term is determined by mutual agreement based on the nature of the collateral, and the maximum shall not exceed three months, and is limited to the legitimate industrial and commercial industries of members of the same industry association. Credit loans and overdrafts have begun to be sent out, and are limited to old customers with good credit. The amount is limited according to its use, and there must be a guarantor with real shares. The total overdraft amount is approved separately. The lending interest rate has been generally increased to more than 3% per month. As for the monthly announcement of deposit and loan interest rates by the money industry, the highest monthly deposit interest rate was previously 6 yuan and the loan interest rate was 33 yuan, which may be appropriately increased in the future, with the aim of eliminating speculation and hoarding and suppressing prices. In addition, the banks will conduct strict investigations and approvals for various industries that need to borrow money due to business needs in order to maintain finance and eliminate malpractices.</p>
<h3>New Financial Institutions: Nine New Institutions Established</h3>
<p>Since the 1st of this month, nine new financial institutions have been established in the city, including two bank branches, five money shops, and two securities firms, as well as one land company.

<h3>Speculative Businesses: Handling Liquidation, Cotton Cloth and Silk Shops Not Yet Open</h3>
<p>Since the Lunar New Year, some speculative businesses have been handling liquidation matters. At the same time, the n絨, silk, satin, and cotton cloth shops have not yet officially opened as of yesterday. Reporters visited leaders of various industry associations and received the following information:</p>
<p>After the relevant authorities actively discussed effective measures, speculative merchants in the entire Shanghai industrial and commercial sector have been severely threatened. At the same time, large quantities of hoarded goods cannot be freely sold, so the money market is extremely tight and turnover is difficult. These merchants are now handling liquidation matters after the end of the general year-end closing.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>Xinzhong First and Second Dyeing Factories have always focused on weaving Longding fine cloth and Yun 細斜.

Also, the Securities Exchange temporarily decided to stop trading in the afternoon from today and resume the original state after February 4th.

<h3>Navy, written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang, Soldier Class (5)</h3>
<p>Takao has also started studying hard recently. Although his math isn't as good as Makoto's, his grades in Japanese, Chinese Literature, and Drawing are all better than Makoto's. His English isn't inferior to Makoto's either.</p>
<p>That year's summer vacation seemed to have nothing to do with the Soldier Class. Takao also spent his whole day at his desk. This worried his parents.</p>
<p>One evening, the sea breeze was cool and the moonlight was bright. Takao was still flipping through a small dictionary under the electric light.</p>
<p>"Go outside and play for a while!" his mother said worriedly.</p>
<p>Although Takao reluctantly went outside for a walk, he felt it was very boring to be alone, so he went to find Makoto. Makoto seemed to be studying too, but because Takao came, he readily agreed. The two of them walked together towards the Tenpouzan Seaside. Along the way, the neighborhood was lit with local custom June lanterns. On the old-fashioned flower lanterns, beautiful pictures were painted, swaying in the cool breeze.</p>
<p>"What beautiful scenery!" Once they reached the seaside, Takao forgot all about his exams. The cherry blossoms he was so used to seeing were shrouded in a blue-purple evening spirit. The moonlight on the sea was faint, and the gently rippling waves radiated a silvery glow.</p>
<p>"I've been practicing shouting commands towards Sakurajima recently - for when I become a military officer in the future." Makoto openly said these things lately.</p>
<p>"Do it and see!" Takao urged him.</p>
<p>"Listen! ... Forward... march..." He shouted with all his might. But the sound just wouldn't come out right. That strange sound wouldn't reach Sakurajima.</p>
<p>"Hahaha, you really can't do it. First of all, a naval officer wouldn't issue that kind of command. If you tell a warship to go 'forward', it won't move forward. You have to shout 'Both sides forward at minimum speed!'" Takao's naval knowledge was also unreliable, but it did seem slightly better than Makoto's.</p>
<p>Teased by Takao, Makoto now began to challenge Takao to a wrestling match.</p>
<p>"Come on!..." The two of them started wrestling on the cold, wet sand. This time, Makoto finally won, and Takao lost three times in a row.</p>
<p>The two of them laughed at each other and lay down on the sand, their bodies exhausted. The cool night breeze blew across the beach, and the full moon on the thirteenth night illuminated Makoto's snow-white skin.</p>
<p>"That's strange!" Takao pointed at the bright moon and said. "Makoto! Look at the moon, are there three? Or four?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, the moon doesn't have a plural."</p>
<p>"Then, how can I see it like this! What's going on?" Takao's voice sounded especially disappointed.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Two or three days later, a special guest came to Makoto's house, Takao's younger sister. She said to Makoto, "My brother is very pessimistic, would you please come to my house and play?"</p>
<p>This year, she was just fourteen years old, tall, and spoke clearly like an adult. Among the gentle Satsuma women, she was a unique figure. Although she was a young girl, she had a stubborn temper and would sometimes bravely argue with her parents. When she entered the girls' school this spring, her relatives all hoped that she would enter the prefectural high school, but she insisted on entering the fashionable private girls' school in Kagoshima, and finally got into that school. That old-fashioned girls' school was located on a distant small mountain. Even when it was difficult to get to school in the rain, because it was the school she liked and chose, she would still force herself to go to school. If you said she was a Satsuma woman, it would be better to say that she had the temperament of a Satsuma man.</p>
<p>Makoto blushed and replied, "Please come! I'm really worried!" Her intention was to ask Makoto to return to her house with her. This was unacceptable! For a young man and a young girl to walk together on the street was a violation of local customs.</p>
<p>"Please go back first!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"No reason..."</p>
<p>Makoto blushed and couldn't speak. Keiko stared at Makoto's face.</p>
<p>"Useless!" she said, shaking her braided hair as she turned and left.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, Makoto quietly entered through the gate, crossed the courtyard, and came to Takao's room. "What did you take?"</p>
<p>"Makoto... because the doctor said I have nearsightedness."</p>
<p>Takao said as if spitting something out and lowered his head.</p>
<p>To be a naval officer, having bad eyesight is a fatal blow. Takao's pessimism was not without reason.</p>
<p>"Then... it's still early. If you wear glasses, it will be okay."</p>
<p>"No, if I wear glasses, I'll become even more nearsighted." "Then go to the seaside and practice looking into the distance. Mount Kirishima, Mount Kaimon... you can look at them."</p>
<p>Although the physical examination for the military academy was approaching, as long as he tried hard, it wouldn't necessarily be bad—</p>
<p>From that day on, the two of them stood on the coast every day, looking at the distant peaks of Mount Takachiho and the Satsuma Fuji behind it. When the nearby scenery entered their eyes, they would hurriedly close their eyes. Although Makoto was only accompanying him, it was not without significance to make his good eyes even better.</p>

<h3>Generous Donation of Scholarships to Help Poor Students, A Young Child's Enthusiasm is Commendable</h3>
<p>Dear Editor: The last time I visited the National Common Occupation Exhibition organized by your organization, I saw many children queuing up to get scholarship registration forms. My father said, "These children have very good grades, but their families are very poor and they don't have money to pay tuition, so they come to the Shenbao to apply for help. This is a very good thing, and we should donate when we have money." I remembered those words in my heart.</p>
<p>I am nine years old this year and studying in the fourth grade of elementary school in the Tianhou Palace. Because I usually don't miss classes and study hard, I got first place in the term exam this time and also received a scholarship of 340 yuan. I remembered what I said before and told my father that I would donate this scholarship to the Shenbao as a scholarship.
