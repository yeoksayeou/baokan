<p>社評</p>
<h3>沉着迎戰</h3>
<p>每逢五月二十七日盟邦日本的海軍節，總使我們想起東鄉元帥　對馬海峽的大決戰，奠定了整個戰事勝利的基礎。而柬鄉元帥獲得勝利的原因，完全在乎他的沉着應戰，把「靜若處子，動如脫兔」，「不鳴則已，一鳴　人」，這幾句話來形容東鄉元帥的作戰精神，是最最確切不過的。</p>
<p>沉看的人不慌張，不魯莽。當帝俄波羅的海　隊”浩浩蕩蕩，從北海繞道非洲駛向日木而來，無　論兵艦的數董，艦隊的配備，都在日木之上，而在東鄉　元帥指揮下的日本艦隊以太無畏的精神，靜靜地等候着。東鄉元帥的態度是安閒，鎭靜，謹愼，直到敵艦駛達對馬海峽，方才發出那歴史上有名的命令：「皇國與麼，在此一舉」，全艦人士，萬衆一心，敵艦殲滅了，戰事也就結束。</p>
<p>沉着的人有準備。語云。。「萬事預則立，不預則廢」，做預備的工夫就在沉着。諸葛亮說：「寧靜以致遠一，寧靜就是沉着。束鄉元帥是個最樸實的人，從一九〇四年十月波羅的海艦隊出動，到一九○五年五月二十七日到達日木海口爲止，東鄉元帥從不曾說一句話，他只是靜靜地想，默默地計劃，實事求是，埋頭苦幹，進行着他的華備工作，直到最緊張的時候，方才施展他的策略，以逸待勞，一舉成功。世人然後方知七八個月的沉着，原來都是做準備工作，等待時間的來到而發動。</p>
<p>沉着的人，强毅果斷，有決心。柬鄉元帥說：「應行之時，毫不躊躇，斷然爲之，以此發揮皇國日本人之覺悟」，這就是當機立斷的精神。決心雖可下於一朝，而下決心的勇氣必須長時期的培養，孟子所謂我善養我浩然之氣，養氣就在於沉着。平時能養氣，臨時然後有勇氣，有決斷，有毅力。</p>
<p>沉着的人不慕榮利，公忠爲國，對於個人木身，澹泊自持。東鄉元帥是個最質樸最溫厚的人，他只知爲國努力工作而不求名利。特別在他凱旋返國之後，仍舊過着冲淡的生活，功成不伐，的是名將風度。他除了多年陪東宮講學之外，仍舊保持他的況默平凡的態度。一個親手把國家造成爲世界上一等强國的，建了功績以後的便遊澹泊，眞是世界上名將的模範。</p>
<p>現在又是大決戰的時期了，無論歐洲戰塲和大東亞戰塲，各方面都正在鈞心門角，但是，最後的結果，誰沉得着氣的，誰就能够得到最後的勝利。我們紀念海軍節，我們要效法東鄉元帥，我們要有準備，有決心，我們要公忠爲國。用沉着的精神去舊門，舊鬥的力量是最偉大的，用沉着的精神去應戰，戰爭的結果必然獲得最後的勝利。</p>
<h3>日全國高揭國旗慶祝海軍紀念節　栗原報道部長昨廣播演講</h3>
<p>東京一十六日中央社電五月二十七日，　第三十九次日木海軍紀念日，回憶當過去日木海一海戰時·故海軍司令長官東鄉元師，會在其所乘之旗檣頭上，高揭一標戰謂：「皇國與廢，在此一戰」。如今太平洋戰局其情形正復如此，將來之太平洋決戰，亦足以決定日本之存亡，東亞之興廢，爲使此次決戰成爲第二之日木海海戰，日木聲大來亞各國，刻正竭其全力，貢獻於戰事。日全國於是日均停止切慶祝事宜，僅高揭國旗，以示祝意。至於日木谷機關之工塲，爲增强戰力，適應當前情勢之要求，刻正作最大努力，以盡職守守，而供戰事之需要。</p>
<p>展開自存自衛戰斗東京二十六日中央社電日大本營海軍報道部長架原大佐，以二十七日爲第三十九次海重紀念日，二十六日晚七時似東京廣播電台作時局講演，題爲「決戰下之海軍紀念日」，以加强擊減英美之決意，而期國民舊起，茲誌其大意如次：距今三十九年前近方二十七日，曾在日木海展開關緊日本興廢之大海戰，我聯合艦隊將波羅的艦隊擊減，獲得空前大勝，彼時日俄戰役推勝後，我國始得安定在東亞之地位，更得宣傳國威於世界。此次之大東亞戰爭，乃因自認爲　界最大强國之英美成脅我國之存立，我不得已而崛起，展開良存自衛之戰鬥，其作戰原因與作戰動機等，與日俄之役恰如出一輒，其　乎國家之存亡一點，亦與日俄戰役完全相同。唯木質上，大東亞戰爭　諸日俄之役意義更為深刻。日俄戰役可稱為臥　當胆十年之戰，大東亞戰則自排斥日本移民時起算，可為謂臥　嘗胆四十年之戰矣。</p>
<p>决戰時機業己成熟大東亞戰　日俄之役，木質相同，僅性格　耳，試觀兩役之戰費，可得其詳，日俄之役，軍費總計十七億元，大東亞戰則僅昭和十九年度追加臨時軍費額，則已達三百八十似元，近代戰爭之决戰兵力，當首推空軍，空軍為戰門之核心，為攻擊之武器，其炸彈等消耗之巨大，遠非昔日之海艦砲戰等可比，近代戰乃一大消耗戰，消耗量火，當然所需補給亦巨，欲求補給，則又不得不大量生產，此不待　　者也，故近代乃一大消耗戰，大補給戰，大生　戰，大科學戰，白質言之，此所以被稱為國家總力戰者也，日俄戰乃以物理戰為主體，陸海軍代法國民出戰，國民僅止於後方聲援，應知大東亞戰，乃將國民完全配置於戰鬥之總方戰也，今太平洋戰局，　　苛烈之程度，與日俱深，而決戰之時機業將成然，敵軍為期「不與日本以充裕之時問，」特積極展開攻勢，且彼等又標榜一毀滅日本」之口號，然吾人决不能認此僅爲一種單純之誇張，質言之，大東亞戰爭乃日木民族與盎格得　克起民族問，爭取興」之民族戰爭，因此戰爭之結果，對於國象民族興亡盛　皮之影　極爲重大。戰勝即可獲得解放日本國民能以最在決心，以應付任何強國欺　之事實，此在我國之歷史上，實不足證明，然僅賴火佑神助及神州不　之觀念，以求獲得勝利之信已，欲眞正獲得勝利，必須具有周達之準備，詳甯之計劇及擊減敵人而後已之精神不可。同時，吾人須牢記擊減敵人之決心及國民努力勞動之精神，乃係獲得勝利之基礎，大東亞戰爭之使命，不僅單爲謀求日木之白衛目存，且更負有建設大東亞其榮圈及建設全世界道義新秩序亞共榮圈，欲賓現八紘一宇之理想，首須口東亞驅逐英美勢力，將其野　與之粉碎，則為先決條件。我國如能戰勝英美，則大東亞各民族即可脫　英美之桎梏，而獲得解放，新秩序建設之任務，亦可因而達成。今乃一億國民發揮其果敢勇猛精神之時機·希望國民把握時機，與前綫將士同樣發揮全力，共赴國難。</p>
<h3>日華北派遣軍　某部隊長談話　日軍在河南作戰經過</h3>
<p>鄭州二十六日中央社電　日華北派遺軍某部隊長，頃就此次河南前綫作戰經過，及市第一綫目附之渝軍抗戰力技弱實情，以及此次作戰給予各方之影嚮等，發表談活如次：此次作戰，以渡過大黃河爲始，首先佔領副王城橋頭堡，此對台人作戰頗爲有利。日重將丘於此次作戰之初，即不顧敵人砲火，展開長時問不眠不休之奮戰，長約三千數百米之橋　堡，於極短之時間內，完成全部工作，此難巨之事業，眞可謂技術部隊登峯造極之一大功績。霸王城前面敵利用寬達數十米之　崖，費時達二年有半建造堅固陣地，然僅費時一日，即被日軍佔領，遂展開澈底之大機動戰。第一錢部隊以及後方補充部隊，一齊展閒不眠不休之活動，神洓之日軍行動，使敵兵措手不及，向敵陣實施分段突破作戰，將敵兵分頭包園。尤値人注視者，即向被淪方推崇之名將湯恩伯，及被　稱精鋭之軍約二十師直系軍，於此次作戰，均狼狽減散，其到處被包圍擊減之情形，實可憐萬分。洛陽方面有蔣鼎文部下之十數師，以及第八戰區增援之二三軍兵力，日軍對此地區作戰目的在消減敵軍，故對洛陽方面事前僅以極少數之兵力，實行監視。再者日軍山西方面之强力兵團，突然波過大黃河，使敵軍腹背受敵，致彼等益陷入潰亂狀態。敵被直自洛甯。盧氏。方面遂次撤退，日軍爲不失良機計，即展開進擊戰，或將敵人包圍，或遮斷敵軍退路。敵軍一部遂於棄武器彈藥，分向深山潰逃。日軍更爲不忍，中國五千年來之歷史文化，化爲灰燼，對攻擊時間一再後延，蓋望敵人藉機反省也。洛陽城內外被國之敵軍約三師左右，日軍於佔領洛陽外廓之後，當對城內之敵軍發出保全洛陽占城之勸告書，不期敵軍仍執迷不悟，日軍遂即展開攻擊，先後將之佔領，使此戰禍，使洛陽古跡一部爲之破壞，爲東漢文化及中國民衆着想。實堪痛恨，敵第一戰區軍僅一閱月之時問，即告完全潰減。參加此次作戰之敵軍爲數不下四十師以上，現已大部彼擊潰，湯恩伯部下敗殘敵兵，似已逃入嵩縣南方魯山西方山岳地帶。此次作戰給　各方影響之大，自不待言。第一，反軸心陣營對日軍持有如此偉大　力，不得不再加認識，第二，重慶方面對和平地區軍事政治之陰謀企國，全被覆滅，使民心大為女定。第一二，獲得進攻之基地，隨時制重慶以死命之態勞，業經確立。第四，由於黃河南北交通之打開，遂予華北華中經濟交流，及和平地區之繁榮　上貢獻尤多，此次作戰中，美駐逾空軍時時出現前綫，重慶人士對此諒必異常期待，殊不知美機之活動，全不足重視，日軍作戰未受任何影嚮，且僅日軍地上砲火擊洛之美機，已達十八架以上，敵方所受損害，反形增大。此次作戰最值注目者，即中國民衆之協力，如自動組織治安維持會，協力日軍修建道路，舖設鐵通，由此足登重慶抗爭意　，業憶脫離民衆，今為上層少數人之操縱而已。又俘虜以及歸順之重慶軍，對敗殘敵兵加以反抗式　　，或奪獲武器被服，由和持為觀之，一般民衆對重慶抗戰之怨憤與反感，實甚為明　，中國民衆今日對和平與抗戰兩途之認識與彩擇，已為目前之事實問題，重慶之指導者，今後必不能再　迷不悟矣。</p>
<h3>敵機空襲大鳥島　計墜毀三十二架　日大本營昨日下午發表</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　日大本營二十六日下午五時發表：敵機動部隊會於五月二十四日出現於大　　附近海面，並竹空　　烏，日軍部隊富即對之　擊，計　落敵機三十架，擊毀二架，日方損失極輕微。</p>
<p>里斯木二十六日中央社電　關於美機勸部隊　繫南爲島事，傳　于海軍部延至二十五日夜始發表，關於京延發表之理由，並未首明，據珍珠　美聯　電稱　攻擊南爲島之指揮官，爲丫國中部太平洋艦隊蒙特哥美利少將，攻擊所受損害，僅承認喪失飛機四架。　襲棋賽島敵艦一艘重創起火</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　據中部太平洋日軍某基地電，敵　逐　二艘二十三日晨來襲馬一紹爾羣爲棋賽島，經日軍所在部隊與之交戰後，將其擊退，內有一　，已受重創起火，日方損害　　。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　據南海日眾某基地電：二十日下午，於南海航行中之日方艦艇，遭遇敵B24型　炸機四架，經交戰結果，擊落美二架，另二架起火遁逃，日方無損害。</p>
<p>華北物價漸見低落　北京二十六日中央社電　河南方而之日軍，作職順初進展，　五日已攻陷洛陽城，據該地消息稱，隨今次作戰之乎展，華北方面之生活必需品等，一般物價已漸次呈低落之現象。日軍佔領京漢全錢以後，則一切物價均較戰前低落一成，此寶因京漢綫打通後，南北物資流通圓滑所致云。</p>
<p>洛陽方面擊落渝機　　　　十六日軍央社電　攻洛陽之日軍部隊，二十日擊落渝B25型機二架（內一架未證實，）擊毀一架。又同日對來　　縣（洛陽西南二十六公里，）之B25型機六十架，以猛烈對空砲火對之　襲，內一架被擊落。二十二日復於洛陽及作水　附近，被擊落B25型機二架，連日以來，日軍部隊極為活躍。</p>
<h3>怒江方面日軍　節節進展中　富貢區渝美軍亦敗退</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電，怒江方面日軍之　減戰，得空軍之支援，節節進展，到處粉碎軍進攻之企圖，最近冷水　，大塘子之渝軍，意圖再起，重整去秋爲日軍怒江作戰所敗之第三十六師國及第一一六，第一二〇，第一九八各師，活躍於日軍之前。該方面日軍有力部隊，當對之作猛烈破襲總於十九日晨展開勇猛攻勢，渝軍遭慘敗，七時二百餘具，然後向東北方退却，是晚更在大塘子北方遭受日軍之夾攻，迄二十日晨，棄尸數百具，軍心大亂。另一方面，　　區渝美聯軍，十二日曾於某河右岸出動編新第二十二師之一圑兵力，以三十輛戰車常先，諜突破日軍第一道防綫，日軍富即奮起應，是役擊毀敵戰車多輛，兩戰綫敵軍相繼失敗，刻渝軍與美人將校迭有反目之事發生。</p>
<p>仰光二十六日中央一社電　南方面渝軍，企　救援印細國境一帶　諾審及加餘方面之美軍空輪部隊，並與之取得聯絡，會於六處波過怒江，來作反攻，兵力約爲一二千人，當爲日軍擊潰。其中最有力之一支軍隊，富推冷水溝方面，自渡過怒江後，會作相當頑强之攻擊，但十九日朝來，終於被日軍猛烈砲擊擊退，棄屍二百餘，向東方潰走，現在渡江之軍，大有舍全而敗退別無他途之概。</p>
<h3>司法行政部長　張一鵬返京發表視察華北感想</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電司法行政部長張一鵬氏，爲視察華北司决狀况，特於木月十日出發赴華北各地視察，歷時牛月，已於二十五日返京。記者爲明瞭張氏此行　過，特於今（二十六）日至司法行政部訪問張氏，當承延見，略告云：本人於十日出發，歷經北平。天津·濟南·靑島·蚱埠·等地，計在北平九日，天　一日，濟南三日，青島日，蚌埠一日，而於昨（二十五）日返京，行稈計十六日。各地司法狀况，以靑島爲最佳，亦最完備，所辦案件，向無　案，而民事案件更能　正實行調解工作。一百件民事　件，受調解者　　六十件以上，不再起訴。關於　解，有調解委員會，有一案件，均由推事一人　委員兩人苦心力勸，至不得已時，決不使其上　，敵此點實為青島司法界之最大特點。至平津及其他各地，其優點有　各地多　舊人，在司法界均有相當聲譽，對司法行政之推　，甚為女力。　　　　　充足，王委員長對　　　項，尤特別注意，向未延發。　有法官訓練所之設立，現已辦至第三　，已畢業達一百二十人，均服務於司法界。至尙在改進之點，有　各地因地方環境特殊，故對所有法令未能一律實行，盼中央以後如訂定法令時，應題及各地地方情形。　華北司法經費雖有一千七百萬元聯銀券，但分配於各省市之司法　關，其　俸亦不甚當裕，故爲使服務可　界人員能安心工作。尙　設决增加待遇。　平津及濟南各地之法院及檢察署，仍未分開，此敵點木人今後當力諜改進，俾使司法行政統一化。</p>

<h3>慶祝盟邦海軍節任海長發表談話應效法日本建設中國海軍</h3>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電今（廿七）日爲盟邦日本第三九屆海軍紀念日，又爲大東亞戰爭發生後之第三次海軍紀念日，其意義之重大，自不待言。我海軍部長任援道氏，爲此特發表談話如下：卅九年以前，正是日本在世界崛起的時候，尤其是日木之海軍，在日俄戰爭當時，由於大將東鄉元帥所統率之聯合經隊，充分發揮其海軍將士之傳統精神，獲得擊減帝俄全部遠征艦隊之輝煌戰績，即一躍而成爲世界上最强大的海軍國。此種偉大的傳統精神力，實激發吾人無限之敬意。數十年來，日本海軍之發奮圖强，繼續耐苦的猛烈訓練，而確立今日戰爭必勝之基礎，這也斷不是偶然的收獲。我們研討日本迭次海戰所以勝利之原因，却又不得不推重於視死如歸，由君愛關的偉大精神，及猛烈訓練，積極培養內在之海軍力量。在日本士兵，則能造成浴血肉搏，奮不顧身的勇士，在將帥則爲大公無私。記得日俄戰爭當初，統率日木海軍，綜握軍政戰略大權之日本海軍大臣山木大將，他曾堅決地道樣說，「日本的軍艦將沉毀一半，兵士亦將死傷一半，可是剩下的一半，必將俄國軍艦全部擊減。」這一席話，就是日本傳統精神的說法，也就是捨身的戰法。</p>
<p>至於說到日木海軍內在力量，一方面是積極培養海軍幹部人材，另一方面乃力求艦船質量的有效，所以日本海軍人材之衆，作戰技術之佳，遠非敵人所能想像。而日本艦船噸位之大，建造之速，亦均超出吾人理想以外，此决非英美所能比擬。此次大東亞戰爭，是世界大變革的撮終戰，現地形勢，盟邦日本已控制大東亞全部交戰水域，日本處於內綫作戰地位，太平洋中大小島嶼，爲堅固之要塞，而其於大陸之交通，厥由海軍任保護之責，由此爲基點，進攻英美之基地，亦自爲海軍之任務。故旦本海軍當前任務之重大，費遠超過日俄戰爭時代，現在英美在太平洋的海軍之力，已半數消滅，僅能作游擊式之沽動，虛偽誇大不中實之報道，以欺騙其本國國民。因爲英美海軍力之喪失，而無法作種種反攻企岡，雖然戰爭尙未結東，但勝利之不會屬於英美，已爲必然之事寶。東亞民族之能獲得此次大東亞戰爭的勝利，我們不欽佩日木海軍的威力，及其海軍將士的舊勇作戰。中國與日本同樣負有保衛東亞之里任，觀之日本海軍之精神力，我國海軍同胞，尤當作爲軍人訓練之借鏡。數十年來，我國海軍建設工作，幾全部呈停頓狀態。國府還都以後，遂積極建設海軍，這雖然是一件非常艱重畢的工作，短期內尙不無有若何大的成績，但只要能持之以恒，不斷的努力，總會有成功的一天。日本建設海軍的歷史，其初期亦與我們今日一樣，這就是我們的好榜樣。今後我國海軍除積極的力謀艦船質量的加强，與發展以外，在培養人的資源方面，我們尤須加速訓練多量的海軍幹部人材，務使均能蔚爲國用，庶處於此聖戰中儘量發揮我國海軍之力量，而負爲戰爭勝利之資任。最近海軍部爲養成海軍幹練人員，除原有之中央海軍軍官學校以外，特招考首屆商船學生，以期養成商船船員，與海軍相輔而行，觀乎報名者之踴躍，足以證明全國同胞對於新中國新海軍建設期望之殷切。嗣後海軍部當陸續舉辦，尙希全國優秀之靑年，踴躍投考，俾使我國海軍力量，得以充實。茲逢日本三十九屆海軍紀念日，吾人謹祝日本海戰全勝，東亞國運昌隆，共期最後勝利的來臨。陸軍部長葉蓬廣播　南京二十六日中央社電紀念盟邦海軍節，宜傳部舉辦特別廣播，二十六日晚由陸軍部長葉蓬担任演講，題爲「日本海戰勝利之今昔觀」。略謂日本海戰今昔相同之點，第一，鬼崇陰謀，激起了決死奮鬥。日俄戰役，日本海軍的決死奮鬥，是由於鬼祟陰諜所激起。第二，出路不正，必這打擊。第三，以逸待勞，必獲勝利。第四，妄稱海軍前輩，輕敵必敗。第五，自恃甲堅兵利，必遭破滅。日本的今昔海戰，旣多相同之點，以往鑒今，以今視昔，吾人當可預知日本今次海戰之勝利，必將同</p>
<p>國府特別法庭　修正組織條例</p>

<h3>華南日軍移交　渝方財產</h3>
<p>廣州二十六日中央社電日華南軍，於二十五日將廣東汕頭地方之軍管淪府財產三百七十件，移交國府保管。日華南軍特就此發表談話如次；「日墓南軍自着手進備移交廣東汕頭等地敵產以來，最近一切手續巳完全就緒，五月二十五日己將移管敵產目錄，完全移交國府」。</p>
<h3>義南戰局轉變德縮短陣</h3>
<p>納吐諾北敵登陸挫敗　柏林二十六日中央社電德元首行營二十五日發表：義戰綫德軍已撤退至利托里亞（Littoria）</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電德國新聞社訊：義大利戰局有變化，因星期三之戰事發展：南義前綫與納吐諾岸頭間及第勒尼安沿岸之德軍，已撤退至維亞阿披亞（Viaappia）東北之山區中於是德軍統一陣綫得以完成，其優點目前固不能　加斷定，然陳綫由此而得大加縮短，實屬於德軍有利。德軍後衛隊力阻各處進攻美軍，並奮刀反擊，使敵軍應戰不得不更爲審愼。另一耍着即星期二英軍在納吐諾包圍圈迤北，企求登陸之舉已遭摧毀，其登陸部隊計有數聯隊之衆概遭　滅。畢柯之西北。　特柯伏附近與比狄蒙特之西，鏖戰尤為劇烈，龐特柯伏與比狄蒙特兩區敵軍出動强力坦克車隊，獲得若干進展，結果德後衛隊不得不撤退至邁爾法區。</p>
<h3>土耳其政府大捕親德派</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電據斯丹埠電：土耳其政府現將親德派多人加以逮捕。</p>
<p>安加拉二十六日中央社電德國新聞社訊：斯丹埠報紙載稱，已退休之薩比斯將軍於星期二被捕，據稱，薩比斯以匿名信多封投入加拉太區之郵筒內，內容指摘土政府之政策，軍事當局以及司法與若干議員之工作。薩比斯之住宅當施以搜查，發見匿名信副木多件，常局對此事件現仍在調查中。</p>
<h3>暴風雨前夕　蘇軍調動忙</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電據最近之前綫消息：蘇軍現於黑海與喀爾巴仟山脈之間，會集結第二第三烏克蘭軍之大兵力於背後，並準備第四烏克蘭戰棧軍，並傳蘇軍機甲兵力已集結約一半於南部戰綫，可見巴爾幹攻勢之展開，現僅爲時間問題，並與此相關聯之蘇軍對保加利亞及其他巴爾幹各國之政治攻勢，近已益趨强化，殊堪注目。</p>
<h3>盟邦日本海軍紀念節特輯之七</h3>
<p>迎接第三十九屆　海軍紀念日松島大佐　　　緒言</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭開始以來我們又在迎接第三次海軍紀念日了。試觀戰局的趨勢，自從前年八月開始的敵方反攻，一年比一年地熾烈起來，現在尼米資上將所率領的美國太平洋艦隊，與麥克沃塞所統率的英美聯合軍，在相互配合呼應着，想從橫貫馬紹爾，特魯克等島的中央突破路綫，以及所羅門，畢斯麥，新幾內亞綫北上的西南突破路綫，企圖迅速前進，打破我國的反攻陣式，以求戰局的好轉，且爭取決戰的良機，以期致大東亞於死命。這就是目前顯示出的形勢。</p>
<p>另外，西歐高唱入雲的開闢第二戰綫的吶喊，現在業已由呌囂變為現實，於是我們軸心國德國的命運，也和我們一樣，是站在生死存亡的千鈞一髪關頭上了。這就是說，戰局的歸趨，將在本年不半期，必定達到決戰階段。</p>
<p>正當嚴重關頭，此次迎接第三十九屆海軍耙念日，這實在具有無限的意義。我們腦海中深印着往者日俄戰爭時的先烈遣敎，且繼承着今日我國戰力基礎的輝煌偉業，以三十餘年來日積月累的傳統精神，和百戰百勝的技術力，來應付敵方的總反攻，一必須加以斷然痛擊，以决皇國命運，以求大東亞建設的進一步明期化。</p>
<p>下面就是提供諸位同胞反省和認識時局的資料，而略加叙述。</p>
<p>日本海海戰的意義與現代海戰的變化</p>
<p>「接到發見敵艦的警報後，聯合艦隊立刻出動，加以擊沉，是日天氣晴凱，但波浪甚高。」「皇國與廢，在此一戰，各位努力奮鬥吧！」這樣永垂史冊的電報和信號，現在仍然在振動着我們日本國民的耳膜，衝擊着我們的心坎。</p>
<p>一九〇五年五月二十七八兩日的日本海大海戰，業已成爲永遠鼓舞激勵日木國民，而加强殉國決心的良好資料。當時的海戰，與陸地上的奉天大會戰相同，都是決定日俄戰爭命運的所謂大決戰，這一點，我想是無需再加資言的吧！</p>
<p>從明治大帝拜受到一朕因汝等忠烈，無愧於祖宗靈前，故甚喜悅」勅語的聯合艦隊之遺勳，是千古不朽，永昭靑史的。</p>
<p>當時海戰的結果，我國在日木海黃海一帶海面，操有絕對的制海權，我國大陸上的陸軍補充綫，得以確保，於是陸軍作戰遂行上並無任何不安，對於俄羅斯本國，因海軍朋潰，而陷直接作戰於不可能，國民士氣消沉，於是便放棄繼績戰爭的念頭。</p>
<p>日木海戰的意義，實際上就是如此之大，且對於後來俄國建設海眾上，曾與以決定性的打聲，即按今日的情勢看，也是很容易判斷的。</p>
<p>因爲對於海軍建設，十自建造軍艦以至訓練海員，無不需要多年的日月，決非投足艦手之功可期成。</p>
<p>然而於近代科學之發達，艦艇兵器的構造性能，愈益複雜精緻，同時對於遝用上，戰略戰術上，都有了劃時代的進步和發展，且飛機及潛水艇的發達，構成爲海上兵力的耍素，於是愈益複雄化了廣汎戰場上，在何種形式下進行大艦隊的交綏，這正是世人絞腦榨汁煞費苦心的問題。在這樣一個時期，大東亞戰爭便緊跟着第二次世界大戰，呱呱墮地了。</p>
<p>歐洲方面，德國海軍比較英美海軍寶在相形見絀，所以德國所採取的戰略，是和前一次大戰相同，盡量逃避主力決戰，而側重於交通綫破壞或機動戰，英美協約國則以封鎖戰爲主耍戰略。保護制海權的重要性，現在仍然未變，地中海的制海權，業已喪失，試觀今日非洲和南養戰爭所造成的結果，是不難想像得到的。自從大東亞戰爭爆發後，對於海軍兵術所形成的巨大變革，就是飛機在海戰中的地位。</p>
<p>夏威夷和馬來等海戰，曾在太平洋給與英美主力艦隊一個決定性的打擊，同時，後來海戰中飛機所表示的威力，曾使英美，尤其使美國，在海軍戰略上改爲飛機第一主義，花其艦隊的編制和戰略的形式上，都煥然改觀，全以航空萬能的理想，爲改革的基礎。美國過去二十幾年慘淡經營的大海軍主刀，蒙受到致命的打擊，茲想挽回旣倒的狂瀾，而發揮畢生之力，自一九四三年初，會接連草成了三次擴張計劃。其簡曾極大舌心於擴張飛機和潛水艇，因大東亞戰爭的開頭，英美曾接一連二的吃過大敗仗，主要是由於飛機的缺少，所以羅斯福大總統於一九四〇年國會咨文中，計劃每年生產五萬架飛機（於一九四三年已達此數），一九四二年度，生產六萬架爲目標，一九四三年度，生產十二萬五千架爲目標。</p>
<p>同時，海上作戰，則放棄了以大艦巨砲主力艦爲中心的大艦隊戰鬥一决雌維的原則，現在則側重於千變萬化的航空母艦集團，進行機動戰，甚至一時中止製造戰艦，而專心意製造航空母艦，更造一步爲補其不足，而改裝巡洋艦爲預備航空母艦，所以目前美國兌有四十五艘航空母艦之多。</p>
<p>以飛機爲主的作戰，就是想在制空權下進行決戰，所以除了以航空母艦集團爲機動部隊而進行交绥之外，還要利用航空基地推進作戰，即所謂蛙式跳躍作戰，或跳烏作戰。這樣自從一九四二年入月以後，於所羅門方面開始反攻，一直達於今日愈演愈烈的程度。</p>
<p>在此我們應當注意的問題，就是在將來的海戰中，果否像日本海戰時那樣，將發生全部艦隊相互的決戰這一問題。</p>
<p>誰都曉得，水無常形，兵無常勢，所以將來在何種機會之下，發生往昔一樣的破釜沉舟大海戰，實在難於保證。然而我們至少可以說，美國海軍旦前所採用的作戰方式，是側重於用航空母艦集團之中的幾個，神出鬼沒地進行機動戰，以調虎離山計引誘出我國的艦隊來，則主要以飛機威力，施以各個擊破的方法，這是昭然若揭的事實了。</p>
<p>在目前飛機進步毫無止境的形勢下，除掉夜戰等特殊塲合，而海戰的勝敗，多半決定於飛機的優劣。所以今後的決戰，就是把敵方主力艦隊引誘到己方所能保持的陸上航空基地之最大利用圈內，同時我們再最大限度地利用一下海上航空兵力，聚而殲之。這一點，作今日美國海軍所採取的作戰傾向方而看，也可以承認的吧！</p>
<p>其次應　注意者，就是海上兵力在確保制海　的條件下，才有意義，同時，制海權而又必須在確保制空權下，才能具有價值。在這樣情形下的今天，海上兵力的作用，無論怎樣縮减，但這種思想是過火地認為局海上交通只有靠飛機所致，總之，不耍忘記，長期的制海與大量物資兵力的運輸，仍然還是以艦船爲主體。</p>
<p>庄於乘機和潛水艇的發達，將來戰艦之類的大型，且需要巨款的軍艦，是否還需耍，業已成爲爭論紛紜莫衷一是的焦點，然而，敵方旣握有大量戰艦，當然我們也有保持多數重艦的必要，這是準備瞬息萬變的海戰狀態的。</p>
<p>總之，以大東亞戰爭爲契機，海戰的狀態，業已變為飛機重心主義的形式—以空戰為主的形式，因此航空基地或根據地的價値，愈益提高，同時為了確保外洋的基地和保證艦隊的行動，則補充路之確保，愈益重要，所以目前業已成爲利用潛水艇和對抗潛水艇戰法的流行時期了。</p>
<p>一方面也正如歐洲戰塲上所盛行者，飛機對於保護通商或破壞通商所起的重要性，愈益增大，此外電波兵器，磁性機雷，「火箭」炸彈等的出現，而頗有使海戰遂漸成為科學鬥賽文化鬥法之勢。　　　大東亞海上作戰的現階段</p>
<p>今年四月十日，美國軍令部長金上將在衆議院委員會中，曾大言不慚地說過：「今後六個月內，美國人民在對日作戰上，必須知道將有莫大犧牲。」又說過：「自從開戰以來，美國海軍艦　資材，至今方能充實起來，將使日木海軍在此數個月內，充分加以認識」。</p>
<p>近來美國海軍，出動機動部隊，自從今年二月中旬以降，曾兩度空　特魯克島，此外對於波拉奧島，包那皮等，都曾企圖由空中侵入，另一方面還想在新幾內亞北岸的荷蘭查進行登陸。</p>
<p>按五月十日華盛頓電報，美國太平洋艦隊司令長尼米資上將，不久前曾在舊金山會見西南太平洋艦隊司令長宮赫爾塞上將，和美國艦隊司令長官金上將。海軍部所發展的公報說，三巨頭决議，如有機會則希望全部擊潰日木海軍，而用全力開始攻勢。</p>
<p>此等報道，固屬一種恫嚇實傳的老生常談，然而最近許多宣傳，都曾顯示出美國的作戰方向，按其宣傳與艦隊的行動，美國海軍於最近的將來，企圖進行破釜沉舟的孤注一擲大决戰，並且大舉來襲，這是可以顯知端倪的。</p>
<p>美國爲什麼這樣急切地耍求决戰呢？理由如下：第一，因為沒有確定的戰爭目的，就無昻揚國民戰意的中心目標，而國內形勢的緊迫，業已達到不適於持久戰的情形，許多工場此起彼伏的罷工，暗殺羅斯福的計畫暴露等，這都是充分證明不適於持久戰的情形。</p>
<p>第二，國內生產勞，業已達到最高限度。常此次往維持高度生產，决非易易，這一點，按飛機生產部長威爾遜所發表，美國飛機的生產率，四月比三月减少，三月曾生產入千七百三十架飛機。這樣也可以推算美國生產能力將降低下去。</p>
<p>第三，試觀印緬國境方面的戰爭形式，即假令站在對重慶和對印度等的政略立場上看，也有迅速援近亞洲大陸的必要。一</p>
<p>不久前，對蘇門答臘北部薩班所實行的空襲，據說曾有一部美國機動部隊參加，這一點或許也含有此種政策的意圖。</p>
<p>第四，即以羅斯福大總統的選舉政策上說，也必須於七月前，取得决定性的戰果。</p>
<p>根據上过貝解，而產生勿與日本以時間的根本理由，所以不顧一切，只急於追求决戰，這就是昭然若揭的事實。</p>
<p>美國計書中的伎略方向，究竟是什麼地方呢？這一點，固然在無錢電裹，是廔經公開聲明過的事，而如按今日的趨勢加以判斷，不難想像到是從馬紹爾羣島，經過特魯克島和波拉奧羣島，而衝向菲律賓，此其一；從新幾內亞北岸，直指菲律賓，此其二。這兩個方向是最值一得重祝的。</p>
<p>美國的意岡，是藉確保菲律賓至華的戰爭連絡錢，以切斷日本本土與資源地帶的交通綫，另外則從中國大陸上推進，擬與日本本土以決定性攻擊，這一點，也是不言而喻的事實。</p>
<p>無論怎樣說，他們所仰賴者，是優勢的飛機戰，與繼之而來的奇襲部隊之登陸作戰，再接着就是整頓基地，向下一個據點衝入。這種戰法，是無容懷疑的。</p>
<p>最近中國大陸上的美國空軍，藉空中運輸，而田印度運來大量的飛機，擴展其飛機基地，將配合海洋方面來的美國飛機之攻擊。</p>
<p>因此，以夏威夷爲根據地的尼米資指揮下的太平洋艦隊，以澳洲爲跳板的麥克沃塞指揮下的美澳聯軍，正在養精蓄鋭，珠馬厲兵，準備接于侵略路綫邁進。</p>
<p>自然不耍忘記，與此相並行的，還有北方或太平洋中央突破的侵大日太本土的牽制戰。</p>
<p>最近因赫爾塞指揮下的西南太平洋艦隊，運戰皆北，受到莫大損失，於是終於解散，劃歸尼米資和麥克沃塞兩將軍直接指揮，赫爾塞本人則轉爲太平洋艦隊的參謀長。然而稱為大砲海軍上將的赫爾基之計劃，不難想像到，是具有相當計謀的。</p>
<p>敵方的盲目攻勢，時機愈一命成熱，其任何犧性在所不惜的來侵，道是今大我們應當知道的，同時，也不難想像到，在今年下半期，敵方將大舉決戰。我們只有以歷史悠久的大日本精神，與百戰百勝的戰略態勢，來粉碎敵人的進攻。</p>
<p>近代戰的特質與敵方宣傳</p>
<p>上面已經謂過，近代海戰是主要運用飛樣和　水艇的。還有一點需要牢記心頭的，就是在這樣廣大的戰區內進行戰爭，局部一地的一勝一敗，是兵家的常事，主要是　我方神謀遠盧，擊潰敵主主力，爭取綜合勝利，這是不待言的。敵方藉花言巧語的宣傅，以蒙蔽全世界人士的視聽，倫敦，華盛頓，重愛，錫蘭島等宣傳大本營，都異口同聲，表演着哇呌蟬鳴的醜態</p>
<p>然而還需要注意一點，就是謊言傅三遍，就被認的是眞實，同時與戰况似是而非的宣傳，有時是奏奇效的。</p>
<p>敵方宣傳充溢着虛妄這一點，由五月十號所發表的一九四二年度損失繿艇名單，而更加看出他們的矛盾百出，然而他們對於宜傳進行的努力，以及方法的巧妙，是與戰局的發展，而愈見其銳利鋒芒</p>
<p>在某種塲合上，他們宣傅我方的不利，以期沮喪人民戰意。</p>
<p>這種宣傳技術，比飛機軍艦的威力更加需要智能，而向我國襲擊，從在遠離戰塲的後方，其威力也會直接影響到我們的生活，這一點是最値得注意的。此外與宣傳並行的還有暗殺，陰謀，散佈毒物，破壞等所謂謀略戰。　　以下轉入第四版以下轉入第四版</p>

<p>日駐華艦隊司令長官近藤僧竹大將，值茲第三十九屆海軍紀念日，特發表談話：回顧光芒萬丈之日本海海戰意義，並力曾帝國海軍應將當年之鹽減精神，灌注於太平洋決戰，而大東亞各民族，亦宜一致舊起。茲誌談話內客如次：</p>
<p>先董將士光榮戰果</p>
<p>在大東亞戰爭年下，欣逢第三十九屆海軍紀念節，憶及當時皇國命運緊此一戰，而奮鬥勇戰擊減强敵於日本海上，決定日俄戰爭大勢之先輩將士武勳，不勝感慨系之，大海戰中能有獲得如此大戰果，當然仰賴大元帥陛下之威嚴與歴代神靈之加議，但帝國海軍即使逢到任何困難境地，亦能予以克服，發揮巧妙戰略之功勞，實也不能磨減。</p>
<p>日俄作戰開始，旅順仁川之成功，是一偉大的序幕。嗣聯合艦隊將敵主力封鎖於旅順，呼應浦監艦隊機動作戰，明洽三十七年五月十五日初　入島以下多數艦艇一度喪失，同年入月十日在黃海海戰中追擊苦戰，今日回想當時艦隊將士之古心，寶使我人欽感於肺腑。又自波羅的海艦隊咎航後，以迄攻略旅順爲止，舉國憂慮，以及陸海軍之協力，而乃迭次苦戰，不惜重大犠牲，在短時期內攻略旅順要安塞，減亡該處敵艦隊，此亦爲日本海海戰大捷之主要原因。</p>
<p>戰局己人决戰階段</p>
<p>再展望目前大東亞戰局，英美之反攻愈演愈烈，即使不提麥克沃　及尼米資等敵方首腦部之言行，而新幾內亞方面與小笠原東南海而敵方機動部隊之蠢勸，亦可明斷爲敵方之反攻。敵人過云恃其物力，採取所謂跳島戰術，但彼等對所受重大損害，缄口不提。企國諱飾决戰之失敗。今日彼等感覺戰局之延　於本身最爲不利，乃期結成西歌第二戰錢，作背城借一之舉。</p>
<p>從敵八之動向而推測，無論何人均能感到現下戰局巳入决戰階段，但我日本海軍糧先輩在日本海海戰時遣留之足跡，以旣往體驗之幾多困難與澈方之戰法，作爲減敵之要訣，完成臨危不動之姿態。</p>
<p>重大時局一致奮起</p>
<p>太平洋戰局可决定將來大東亞命運，我日木一億國民應一致奮起，使大東亞回復木來而口。中華民國以次各東亞盟邦，在堅固團結下，向貫澈作戰邁進，運達到我等月的之日已不遠矣。</p>
<p>日本戰力，如生產飛機，建造艦船等各方面，均有長足之進展，向擊減敵人猛進，此當然爲日木國民報國精神之顯露，以及盟邦諸國民在直接問接上支援協力之所踢，在此表深厚感謝。幷望予以更大協力。當此世界大轉捩時期，發揮我東亞民族之年稍神，正在此秋，願盟邦各國民不受英美宣傳蠱惑，自力更生，以共赴此重大時局。</p>

<p>鹽田大尉演詞</p>
<p>從大東亞戰爭勃發以來，到現在已經是過第三次的海車紀念日了。在這個值得紀念的時候，由中國廣抽協會和中華電影公司主辦海軍紀念日的慶祝大會，鄙人能得到說朋戰局現况的機會，眞覺得非常榮幸。</p>
<p>四十年前空前大</p>
<p>從現在起，四十年以前，我國日本的東鄉大將，率領聯合艦隊，在日本海邀擊俄國的「波羅的海」艦隊，獲得世界戰史上空前的大勝利，敵方的艦隊卅八只船的裹面，只有兩只駛到「海參威」去了，其餘的卅六只，有的被我們打沉了，有的被我們拿捕了，俘處從司令官起有六千人之多，這個時候我們的損害，不過是三條水雷艇而巳，我們所以能够得到這樣的勝利，當然是有種種理由，現在讓我來說一說。</p>
<p>第一是爲打破俄國想爭霸東亞的野心而保守我們的生存權。第二是我國日木的國民，都能充分的認淸這個戰爭的勝敗，是可以決定日本的繁宋與減亡的，所以才上下一致的集中所有的力量在這個戰事上。第三是一兵一卒都充滿了殉國的精神。四十年前的日本的這個狀態，便是現在的日木的狀態，所不同的只是敵人不是俄國，而是英美，戰塲不是滿洲，而是廣大的太平洋。但是戰爭的目的和國民的決心，是絲毫沒有兩樣的。敵人英美制　的野心，比較渦丟的俄國是巧妙到了極點，規模大的不能最大了，就是由歷史上來看，亞細亞的近世史，也全是我們祖先的排除英美勢力的血史，從英國的近世殖民運動開始以來，三百年問，我們的祖先做他們的奴隸，爲他們所驅使，就像印度細甸的被佔領，和南京條約北京條約天津條約等等，我們若打算數一數英美人侵略亞細亞的歷史，無論如何，拿十側手指是數不過來的。不幸我們亞細亞人就沒有覺悟自已有着偉大的力量，而且還中了敵人的謀略，把吾們的生活弄成阿片化漸漸的自減起來。在這個漸漸走向滅亡的大東亞裹，日本消減了俄國的艦隊，得了大勝，於是才從睡夢裹喚醒大東亞的民族，從此大東亞便對英美開始精神的鬥爭。孫總理說過：「從日本在日俄戰爭得勝以來，全亞細亞民族就想樹立起打破歐洲的獨立運動將來這個潮流趨向的地方，想必是亞細亞民族的聯合」。日本海海戰以來，日木海軍根據歷史上的必然性，就擔起了監視來自海上的英美侵略東亞的重大任務，所以日木和英美的戰爭，四十年前巳經成了歷史的宿命。</p>
<p>美國野心完全暴露</p>
<p>但是日本爲了世界的和平，不能不避免戰爭，所以把一切準備妥常完了，就派野村和來柄兩位代表到美國做最後的和平交涉，可是美國倒反把我們當做先天性的奴隸民族，認爲美國的侵略東亞，由世界和平上說是當然的，使堅持着他們那美國式的見解來威脅我們，結果我們的努力成了泡影，會談終告决裂，根據上面說的幾點，日本的戰爭目的，是明明白白得了，的確是以天價爲本的保衛作戰，是爲了要從英美海賊殖民政策裏放出大東亞來的所謂正義的戰爭。日本的戰爭目的，是任何人都不能攻擊的，可是英美人爲什麽作戰呢？敵方的士兵這樣說：「戰爭的對象是很明白的，可是爲什麼要戰爭呢！」敵國的指學者的最大目標，是想化大東亞爲南美化，而對國民便拿「爲民主主義」，「爲人道」，「爲自由」等等的標語，强要國民的戰死。但是這種狀態，究竟能繼續到甚麼時候，很是疑問，霸道的崩潰。在歷史上是很明顯的，美國稱新世界的野心，也絕對不能例外，善良的美國國民，眼看着自己國家的現實狀况，巳經對於美國的民主主義是甚麼，美國式的人道是甚麼意思，充分的了解起來。所以現在美國國內和聯合國是內亂上又加上內亂，美國國內的人種的對立和罷工事件的頻發，就是實在的例。就是在聯合國方面，也是有英國領土美領化，美對蘇聯的沉默戰，英對蘇聯的互相猜疑等等問題。拿沒有戰爭目的的美國首腦部做中心，繼績着內亂。</p>
<p>犧牲重大開始反攻</p>
<p>但是美國因爲是誇張物量的國家，所以在開戰磅頭的夏威夷大敗和喪失太平洋上的各基地後，一時便呆然無所措。自從前年入月以來，就拿全力來重整海軍，開始了對日的大反攻。現在再說敵方的反攻，美國海軍的個是從夏威夷，經過馬紹爾，托拉克，關烏，馬尼刺，到中國，就是所謂中新幾內亞，就是所謂南方目尼米蔬，和西南太不洋聯合軍司令官麥克沃塞，是想用空母集團的機動部隊，依次佔領各據點，在可能的時候，就打算用所謂蚌跳戰術一舉而和我國日本的艦隊決戰，然後侵入中國，以中國爲戰塲。但是敵人的這種作戰一直到經過一年九個月的現在，所得的不過是佔領幾個小島而已，可是他們在人物兩方面所受的損害，實已是莫大的犧牲了。從去年一月三十日以來，敵方又呼喊着尼米茲攻勢，不顧莫大的犧牲，根據推測敵方在人的方面所受的損書，就是只就海上來看，也有二十九萬八千之多，在海戰上說已經是蒙受致戰鬥，新不列顛及所羅門羣島的一部，依然是在我有的陸上兵力，都集中在新幾內亞，而他們的作戰也不能按照計劃進行，反而成為我們的航空部隊的良好目標。再看印度洋方面，英軍蒙特巴頓和美軍史蒂威爾，因作戰上的意見不合，結果放棄了緬甸反攻，把司令部遷到了錫關爲，不過爲了自己的面十起見，對蘇門答臘方面派了一部份機動部隊，所以敵人戰術這一方面的戰意簡直就沒有可說的了。像以上所說，敵人不顧莫大的犧牲，想和日本決戰，是爲什麽呢？還有美軍不惜打破其他聯合軍首腦部的作戰方法，而强行自己所希望的作戰，又是什麽理由呢？這倒是極有與味的問題。</p>
<p>急欲决戰四個理由　　我認爲美國像這樣的急欲决戰的理由，</p>
<p>第一，因爲沒有確固的作戰目的，就沒有昂揚國民戰意的中心目標，所以戰事的長期化，是容易惹起美國國內的動亂，就像工塲已經是在連續的演着罷工事件，還有計劃啃殺羅斯福的事件發生等等，這都是國內不安的現象，並且因爲美國兵士的莫大犧牲，靑少年的徵兵成了助長戰爭空氣的原因，由於農村的破壞，異人種的多置移住，便引起了種種的社會問題，結果國民看淸現實下的戰局，對於指導者所呼喊的「爲正義」「爲民主主義』的標語，簡直就不信了。</p>
<p>第二，國內的生產方巳經達到最高限度，今後的增加，就沒有希望，無器貸與，而且武器貸與的減小，正是能成為美國不能攏絡聯合國的原因，所以一定要馬上得勝才好。</p>
<p>第三，是從政法上來看，重慶和印度從現在起，就要防備他們的脫落，在可能範團內，是要早一點結成和大陸間的連絡路綫，因爲道是將來也可以掌握大東亞的原因。</p>
<p>第四，羅斯福希望在本年秋季選舉天總統的時候，能够第四次當選，所以一定要收個大戰果來轉好國民興趣。由兵術上來看，焦慮是最應該謹愼的，焦急的人一定會失敗。美國最初曾經宣告過以長期來打倒日本，而現在最希望的是期戰。</p>
<p>敵方希望短期作戰　　那麼敵方爲什機已經增加到數倍，並且這種重工業在南方是正在繼續的設立着。第三，日本佔領的基地，極其要塞化，月月加强，戰時的長期化是愈能加大美國的犧牲的。第四，是日本保持着人的餘力，等待着美軍兵力的消耗，而開始反擊。第五，最近的國際情勢是更加微妙，研究爲什麼變化的這樣急，簡直就不可預測。第六，是亞細亞漸漸的向着團結的方向進行着。敵方根據以上的幾個理由，急欲和日本艦隊決一死戰，可是實際把握着決戰的鑰匙的是日本海軍。等到日本海軍本着他們的希望，給他們決戰的機會的時候，那麼就要像四十年前的日本海海戰同樣的使美國遭遇大敗。鄙人以前說過美國的最後目的是在乎征服大東亞，他的中心目標，實在是中國，美國的計劃是先進到中國，利用中國人物兩方面的條件，來打倒日木。同時目己獨佔戰後的中國，就像獨占重慶的空軍，把增重慶的指導權等等，這都是爲了達成他的計劃。一</p>
<p>自信必得斷然勝利</p>
<p>美軍卡納中校在他所著的「美國的攻擊作戰」裏說：「若是在亞細亞沒有眞的基地，就不能保持美國在遠東的地位·」現在再簡學的說一說，美國的指導者用什麽方法來欺騙國民，而使國民關心大東亞，由歴史的關係上看，美國國民無論如何要關心歐洲，而爲了要使國民的關心轉向東亞，所以就唱起要打倒德國第一主義。英國和美國的國民，就認爲這是一件當然的事，可是重慶和澳洲新西蘭，使起了猛烈的反對，當然美國征服東亞的首腦部，早就預想到這種反對，這是他們所望的事，一面美國政府派遣外交團威爾基等到重慶，向國民宣傳東亞的主要性，在這個謀略完成之後，羅斯福就宣言必須重視太平洋的事，舉行魁北克會談，按照預定計劃侵進中國；現在又驅遂英國及蘇聯的勢力，在重慶造成確固的勢力，像以上所說明的。我們從四十年以前就造定了和英美鬥爭的歷史的運命，而且這歷史的宿命，現在已經成事實，在各處展開猛烈的戰鬥。但是敵人爲甚麽急要決戰，爲什麽往中國進兵，是我們應當重新認淸的。在這個決戰期裏，日本海軍的主力艦隊，默默的等待着決戰時機的成熟，在這個決戰裏是有着斷然得勝的自信的，我們作爲亞細亞戰鬥的細亞民族和打破英美人的先天性的優越觀念，是有着充分的觸悟，現在重新的介紹給諸位。</p>

<h3>海軍紀念節特輯　自第二版轉來</h3>
<p>當戰局一時不利的時候，此種宣傳就會發生乾柴與烈火的作用，回顧上次大戰的實例，以及此次大戰中的荷蘭和比利時，都會證明這一理論之非妄。何况一旦生活必需品感覺缺乏時，尤易發生這種接受敵方宣傳的可能·</p>
<p>美國的間圖與兵術上的理念</p>
<p>美國陸軍中校兼軍事評論家嘉南氏，在「美國的進攻作戰」一書中，曾說過下列的話：</p>
<p>「日本發動九一八事變的那一天，就是美國對於保持或放氣菲律戰為陸海軍基地，最後决定態度的一天。假如美國决定保持他，則應立刻對日本表永堅决壓迫。那才是美國眞正在遠東爭取大陸立脚點的時期。假如當時與日本宜戰，則美國一定很輕而易舉地戰勝日本。這樣結果，就可以中國為保護國，以全圖精神開發中國，於遠東各處建立飛機工塲和軍用飛機塲，於中國大陸基地上就可以實現戰略原料資材之濟積。於是至少在中國可以駐紥三十萬美國軍隊。」此外運說：「如在亞洲沒有眞正大陸基地，則美國在遠東的軍事地位，是完全不能保持的。」</p>
<p>縱使不去追間狄奧多·羅斯福和約翰赫的過去，也不難想像美國對遠東和中國具有何種野心的。</p>
<p>然而不要忘記，當實現道種野心的時候，他們是充滿着他們祖先開拓民的血液，而具有　幹性格的。</p>
<p>他們總以搶據世界最大土地為光榮，這也就是他們的一貫傳統。</p>
<p>還不要忘記，他們用力量，努力，堅忍，爭取目己的幸福和繁榮，當南北戰爭時，對於同一民族的南軍資藏弗基尼亞州一帶的人家，田國，倉　中滿滿的食糧，牧塲中嬉戲的家　，以及一切，都曾付之一炬，對於屬殺老幼婦女，施以極端的殘酷，總而言口之，他們的天性，是凡為自己的幸福和繁榮有利，則任何犧牲在所不惜。</p>
<p>嘉南中校說：「世界上並沒有絕對不破的戰綫，也並沒有渡洋不能的海軍。」接着又說：</p>
<p>「美國如放棄實束手轉足的防　戰略後。　議始能以奇要素素加以以實，而就不會拘泥於預先印成的作戰計畫書衷，隨時都可以把樹過　的機會，利用美國豐富的內以漏，創　堂哉島戰的劉黨作戰技巧，而可以左右逢原約攻擊目前。　之·只有攻勢作嚴指導下的攻勢作　，和美國的豐富的物資，才是走向勝利的途徑。」</p>
<p>於一九四二年一月二該書發行時的形勢，他曾作過下列結論：　戰爭曾巳達到停止對軸心實行不痛不癢的攻勢階段了，而應採取具有決定性的攻勢階段了。</p>
<p>對軸心採取決定性攻勢的可能性。是以民主國家取得制　蔆和制空浙為基本條件。</p>
<p>以制海權和制空權為基本條件，而在大陸上鞏固自己的確乎不拔之立脚點，堅決採戰攻勢，這就是寇了所倡導的美國攻勢作議之不二方針。</p>
<p>根據這一點，來判斷目前太平洋戰局的時侯，我們必須牢記，他們來猛排我們，將比掠奪美洲新天陸時的野獸行為，還要殘忍百倍。</p>
<p>論</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，業巳迫議近決戰階段了。</p>
<p>而大東亞職爭的目的，正如宜戰韶醫所示，是以「確保東亞的安定，國世界的和平」，今日是發於我國建國以來的悠久歷史，「與列國篤原交誼，同享萬邦共榮之樂」，根據這種帝國外交的根本方針，所以正如聖上所宣示，是為「發揮光大祖宗之遺業」的神聖戰爭。</p>
<p>誠如神武天皇御謂所示，無非為「上則答授韓靈國之德，下則弘查皇孫正之心」的聖上籲念。</p>
<p>宣擾正義於萬邦，根孫日本國策，價萬邦各得其所，使東亞返歸本然姿麗，這就是此次聖戰永垂史冊的光明正大目標。</p>
<p>我等於皇紀元千六百零一年所發動的此次空戰戲，按照袖武大皇以來日本臣民所縱傳下來的各國所神，在此最大的飛躍寫中，羣定大東亞天地內的常固帛基。</p>
<p>與英美為了國己的野心，自己的繁榮，而奴役東亞民族，榨取東亞道稱思想，實在有逈乎不同的根本點。花天酒地的敗家子，毫無資色的揮霍祖藏父業，而為自己的私欲，下普任可手沒，道　自暴自棄的狂蘭作風，和我們日本是有天　之別的。</p>
<p>所以「立於神靈之上」的我們日本人，一舉手一投足，全是神意的流認，同時毫不惋惜的詢國决心，以及殺敵致果的堅固必勝信念，也全都是發乎此的。</p>
<p>三十九年前，變肩担負着皇國命運，而進行過殊死戰的大伴物部之之十孫，現在為了斬絕想以巨翼遮蔽世界的怪島妖魔，按神矛拔實刀，而是舉國拼命的時期了。</p>
<p>「息國興廢，在此一戰。」</p>
<p>我們各自在職業不崗位上，克盡戲民一份子的最大責任，必求聖戰目的實徹。</p>
<p>東鄉元帥的到資格言說：「大敵不懼，小敵不侮，不常希冀敵之不至，凡我宜待處，决不為敵所乘。疏忽為大敵，片刻小事，亦不宜怠於警戒。」又說。:「神明唯受案冠予致力平素鍛煉而不戰已勝者。」</p>
<p>在草原的大和島傍發揮光明，時來兮，斬妖</p>
<h3>東鄕元帥　金言集</h3>
<p>勝敗在於主將之意氣</p>
<p>要之，大艦隊之職鬥如一一待令而行，則未免迂遠，誤矣。全軍仰瞻主將之態度，效法養處，始可獲得大捷。主將乃可為全軍目標之響導者，而非徒然弄舌之　令者。余望掌握我軍主力、為全軍模節以事職鬥。</p>
<p>敵我苦戰</p>
<p>戰時我可有敵雖數倍亦陷苦境之觀念。古之兵家以此為七分三分接仗之飲·即思及數七分我三分時，實際即五分五分之謂也。</p>
<p>不斷戰爭</p>
<p>武人之一生為連綿不斷之之戰爭，由其平時之戰門而一分其職務之輕重。有事發揮武力，無事則修養之，始終一賞，但求盡其本分。</p>
<p>古素之調練不斷之修養</p>
<p>勝算在胸。平素之訓練及决心最為重要。須常念平紫之訓練，不斷之修養為第一要務。</p>
<p>百發百中之砲一門，足母百發一中之砲百門。</p>
<p>信仰</p>
<p>神明確唯授時利榮冠予致力平素鍛練而不戰已勝者；至對以一勝為滿足而安於治平者，則立即擬奪也。</p>
<p>疏忽者大敵也</p>
<p>勿怖大敵，勿侮小敵，常不恃數之不來，我荀時刻待之，决無不可發覺之事。</p>
<p>疏忽者大敵也。縱為片時瞬刻，毋怠警戒！</p>
<p>無形之實力</p>
<p>武力非僅在於糧隊兵嚴等，而在活用此等之無形實力。</p>
<p>積極攻擊為最良防御</p>
<p>既已交戰，則無防御之必要。藍積極之攻擊便為最良之防御。</p>
<p>必勝不敗</p>
<p>勝敗之觀念為未交戰以前之事，一旦白刃相接，决不可用以勝敗爲念。裏敗者必敗無疑。（全文一完）（吉慶）</p>

        <h1>1944.05.27</h1>
<h3>Facing the Battle Calmly</h3>
<p>Every year on May 27th, the Navy Day of our ally Japan, always reminds us of Marshal Togo's great decisive battle in the Tsushima Strait, which laid the foundation for the victory of the entire war. And the reason Marshal Togo was victorious lies entirely in his calm response, truly embodying the spirit of "still as a virgin, swift as a rabbit," and "does not cry out, but when he does, he startles the world." These phrases perfectly describe Marshal Togo's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>A calm person does not panic, does not act recklessly. When the mighty Russian Imperial Baltic Fleet sailed from the North Sea around Africa toward Japan, its number of warships and the equipment of the fleet were superior to those of Japan. But the Japanese fleet under the command of Marshal Togo waited quietly with fearless spirit. Marshal Togo's attitude was relaxed, calm, and cautious, until the enemy fleet reached the Tsushima Strait, only then did he issue the historically famous order: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle," and with all the personnel of the fleet united, the enemy fleet was annihilated, and the war ended.</p>
<p>A calm person is prepared. As the saying goes, "Preparedness ensures success, lack of preparation ensures failure." The effort of preparation lies in calmness. Zhuge Liang said: "Tranquility leads to far-reaching influence." Tranquility is calmness. Marshal Togo was a most simple and honest person. From the time the Baltic Fleet set out in October 1904 until it reached Japanese waters on May 27, 1905, Marshal Togo never uttered a word. He simply thought quietly, planned silently, worked diligently, and carried out his preparation work until the most critical moment, when he finally implemented his strategy, awaiting the enemy at leisure to strike with one blow. Only then did the world realize that seven or eight months of calmness were all for preparation work, waiting for the right time to launch.</p>
<p>A calm person is strong, resolute, and decisive. Marshal Togo said, "When the time comes to act, do not hesitate, but do it decisively, to demonstrate the resolve of the Japanese people for the sake of the Empire." This is the spirit of decisive action. Determination can be made in a day, but the courage to make a decision must be cultivated over a long period of time. Mencius spoke of cultivating one's vast, righteous spirit, and cultivating spirit lies in calmness. If one can cultivate spirit in ordinary times, then one will have courage, decisiveness, and perseverance in times of crisis.</p>
<p>A calm person does not covet fame or fortune, and is loyal to the country. For himself, he maintains detachment. Marshal Togo was the most simple, kind, and honest person. He only knew to work hard for the country and did not seek fame or fortune. Especially after his triumphant return, he still lived a plain life, not boasting of his achievements, truly the demeanor of a famous general. In addition to lecturing the Crown Prince for many years, he still maintained his quiet and ordinary demeanor. A person who single-handedly turned his country into a first-class world power, and then lived in detachment after achieving meritorious service, is truly a model for famous generals in the world.</p>
<p>Now is another period of great decisive battles, whether on the European battlefield or the Greater East Asia battlefield, all aspects are at a critical juncture. However, in the end, whoever remains calm will be able to achieve the final victory. As we commemorate Navy Day, we must emulate Marshal Togo. We must be prepared, have determination, and be loyal to the country. The power of calm determination is the greatest. Using a calm spirit to face the battle, the result of the war will inevitably be the final victory.</p>
<h3>The Entire Country of Japan Raises National Flags to Celebrate Navy Memorial Day; Director of Information Kurihara Gave a Broadcast Speech Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency): May 27th is the 39th Japanese Navy Memorial Day. Recalling the past sea battle, the late Navy Commander-in-Chief Marshal Togo once raised a battle flag on the masthead of his ship, saying: "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle." Now, the situation in the Pacific war is just like that. The future decisive battle in the Pacific will also determine the survival of Japan and the rise and fall of East Asia. To make this decisive battle a second Japanese naval battle, Japan and the Greater East Asia countries are exerting all their efforts to contribute to the war. On this day, the entire country of Japan will suspend all celebratory activities and only raise the national flag to show their wishes. As for the factories of Japanese agencies, in order to increase combat power and adapt to the current situation, they are making their greatest efforts to fulfill their duties and meet the needs of the war.</p>
<p>Unfolding a Battle for Survival and Self-Defense Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency): Colonel Kurihara, Director of the Navy Information Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a speech on the current situation on the 26th at 7:00 PM from the Tokyo Broadcasting Station, titled "Navy Memorial Day Under the Decisive Battle," to strengthen the determination to defeat the British and Americans and to encourage the people to unite, as the 39th Heavy Memorial Day on the 27th. The main points are as follows: Nearly thirty-nine years ago, on the 27th, a great naval battle concerning the rise and fall of Japan was launched in the Japanese Sea. Our combined fleet defeated the Baltic Fleet and achieved an unprecedented victory. After the victory of the Russo-Japanese War at that time, our country was able to stabilize its position in East Asia and further promote its national prestige to the world. This Greater East Asia War was caused by the United Kingdom and the United States, which considered themselves the world's largest power, threatening the existence of our country, so we had no choice but to rise up and launch a battle for survival and self-defense. Its reasons for war and motives for war are exactly the same as those of the Russo-Japanese War. The point concerning the survival of the country is also exactly the same as that of the Russo-Japanese War. However, in essence, the Greater East Asia War is more profound in meaning than the Russo-Japanese War. The Russo-Japanese War can be called a ten-year war of lying on firewood and tasting gall, while the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a forty-year war of lying on firewood and tasting gall, starting from the time when Japan's immigrants were rejected.</p>
<p>The Time for a Decisive Battle Has Matured. The Greater East Asia War and the Russo-Japanese War are essentially the same, only their character is different. The details can be seen by observing the war expenses of the two wars. The total military expenditure of the Russo-Japanese War was 1.7 billion yuan. The amount of additional temporary military expenditure for the Greater East Asia War in Showa 19 alone has reached 380 million yuan. In modern warfare, the air force should be the first to be the decisive force. The air force is the core of the battle and the weapon of attack. Its consumption of bombs and other items is far greater than that of naval gun battles in the past. Modern warfare is a great consumption war, and the amount of consumption is great, and of course, the required supplies are also huge. If you want to supply, you have to produce in large quantities. Therefore, modern warfare is a great consumption war, a great supply war, a great production war, and a great science war. In essence, this is why it is called the national total war. The Russo-Japanese War was mainly a physical war. The army and navy fought for the people, and the people only supported from the rear. It should be known that the Greater East Asia War is a total war in which the people are completely deployed in battle. Now the situation in the Pacific War is becoming more and more severe, and the time for a decisive battle is about to mature. The enemy is actively launching an offensive, aiming "not to give Japan ample time," and they are also advocating the slogan of "destroying Japan." However, we must not regard this as a mere exaggeration. In essence, the Greater East Asia War is a national war between the Japanese nation and the Anglo-Saxon nation to win "prosperity." Therefore, the result of this war has a very important impact on the rise and fall of national ethnicity. A victory can liberate the Japanese people and enable them to face any strong country's bullying with the utmost determination. This is not enough to prove in our country's history. However, relying only on the idea of divine help and the indestructibility of the divine land to seek a victory is not enough. To truly win, we must have thorough preparations, detailed plans, and the spirit of defeating the enemy before stopping. At the same time, we must keep in mind that the determination to defeat the enemy and the spirit of national hard work are the foundations for winning victory. The mission of the Greater East Asia War is not only to seek self-defense for Japan, but also to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and to build a new moral order in the world. If we want to realize the ideal of Hakko Ichiu, we must first expel the British and American forces from East Asia and crush their ambitions. If our country can defeat the United Kingdom and the United States, then the nations of Greater East Asia can break away from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States and gain liberation, and the task of building a new order can also be achieved. Now is the time for 100 million people to give full play to their courageous and bold spirit. I hope the people will seize the opportunity, give full play to their strength like the soldiers on the front line, and jointly overcome national difficulties.</p>
<h3>A Certain Unit Commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army Talks About the Course of the Japanese Army's Operation in Henan</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou, 26th (Central News Agency): A certain unit commander of the Japanese North China Dispatch Army recently gave a speech on the course of the operation on the front line in Henan, the weakness of the Chongqing army's resistance on the first line, and the impact of this operation on all parties. The talk is as follows: This operation began with crossing the Yellow River. The first step was to occupy the bridgehead of Ba Wangcheng, which was quite beneficial for the operation. At the beginning of this operation, the Japanese army disregarded the enemy's artillery fire and launched a long period of sleepless and tireless struggle. The bridgehead, which was about 3,000 meters long, was completed in a very short time. This difficult task can be called a great achievement of the technical troops. In front of Ba Wangcheng, the enemy used a cliff dozens of meters wide and spent two and a half years building a solid position. However, the Japanese army occupied it in just one day, and then launched a thorough large-scale maneuver war. The first-line troops and the rear supply troops all launched sleepless and tireless activities. The miraculous movement of the Japanese army caught the enemy soldiers off guard, and they implemented a segmented breakthrough operation against the enemy's position, dividing and encircling the enemy soldiers. What is particularly noteworthy is that Tang Enbo, the famous general who was admired by the occupied party, and the elite army of about 20 divisions under his direct command, were all defeated and dispersed in this operation. Their situation of being surrounded and defeated everywhere was really pitiful. In Luoyang, there were more than a dozen divisions under Jiang Dingwen, as well as the reinforcements from the Eighth War Zone, with a force of two or three armies. The purpose of the Japanese army's operation in this area was to eliminate the enemy's army, so they only used a very small number of troops to monitor the Luoyang area in advance. Furthermore, the powerful corps of the Japanese army in Shanxi suddenly crossed the Yellow River, causing the enemy army to be attacked from both sides, which made them even more chaotic. The enemy was directly retreating from Luoning and Lushi. In order not to miss the opportunity, the Japanese army launched an offensive, either encircling the enemy or cutting off the enemy's retreat. Some of the enemy's troops abandoned their weapons and ammunition and fled into the deep mountains. The Japanese army, even more, did not want the five thousand years of Chinese history and culture to be turned into ashes, so they repeatedly postponed the attack time, hoping that the enemy would take the opportunity to reflect. There were about three divisions of enemy troops inside and outside Luoyang City. After the Japanese army occupied the outer city of Luoyang, they issued a letter of advice to the enemy troops in the city to preserve Luoyang. Unexpectedly, the enemy was still obsessed with their mistakes, so the Japanese army immediately launched an attack and successively occupied it, causing this war to destroy part of the ancient Luoyang site. For the sake of Eastern Han culture and the Chinese people, it is really hateful. The enemy's First War Zone army was completely defeated in just one month. More than 40 divisions of the enemy army participated in this operation, and most of them have been defeated. Tang Enbo's defeated and remnants of the enemy soldiers seem to have escaped into the mountainous area south of Songxian and west of Lushan. The impact of this operation on all parties is self-evident. First, the anti-axis camp must recognize the Japanese army's great strength. Second, Chongqing's military and political conspiracy in the peaceful area was completely destroyed, which greatly stabilized the people's hearts. Third, they gained a base for attacking and established a state of controlling Chongqing's fate at any time. Fourth, the opening of traffic north and south of the Yellow River has contributed greatly to the economic exchange between North China and Central China, and to the prosperity of the peaceful area. During this operation, the US-驻逾空军 often appeared on the front line. The people of Chongqing must have expected this very much. However, the activities of the US planes are not worth paying attention to at all. The Japanese army's operations were not affected in any way, and only the US planes that were shot down by the Japanese army's ground artillery fire have reached more than 18. The damage suffered by the enemy has increased instead. What is most noteworthy in this operation is the cooperation of the Chinese people, such as the automatic organization of security maintenance associations, cooperation with the Japanese army in building roads and laying iron pipes, which is enough to show that Chongqing's resistance intention has been detached from the people and is now controlled by a small number of people in the upper class. In addition, the captured and surrendered Chongqing army added resistance-style to the defeated and remnant enemy soldiers, or seized weapons and clothing, which shows that the general public's resentment and antipathy towards Chongqing's resistance are very obvious. The Chinese people's understanding and choice between peace and resistance are now a matter of fact. Chongqing's leaders will not be able to continue to be obsessed with their mistakes.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Progressing Steadily on the Nujiang Front; Yuan-U.S. Allied Forces in the Fugong Area Are Also Retreating</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency), The Japanese army's war in the Nujiang area is progressing steadily with the support of the air force, crushing the enemy's attempts to attack everywhere. Recently, the Yuan army in Lengshui, Datangzi, and other places intended to rise again and reorganize the 36th Division and the 116th, 120th, and 198th Divisions, which were defeated by the Japanese army in the Nujiang operation last autumn, and were active in front of the Japanese army. The powerful Japanese army in the area launched a fierce surprise attack against them. On the morning of the 19th, they launched a courageous offensive. The Yuan army suffered a disastrous defeat, with more than 700 bodies left behind, and then retreated to the northeast. On the same evening, they were ambushed by the Japanese army north of Datangzi, leaving hundreds of bodies behind by the morning of the 20th, and the morale of the army was greatly shaken. On the other hand, the Yuan-U.S. Allied Forces in the 　　 area dispatched one battalion of the newly formed 22nd Division on the right bank of a certain river on the 12th, with 30 tanks in front, attempting to break through the first line of defense of the Japanese army. The Japanese army immediately rose up to respond, destroying many enemy tanks in this battle. The enemy forces on both fronts failed successively, and there have been frequent cases of Yuan officers and American majors turning against each other.</p>
<p>Yangon, 26th (Central Agency): Yuan troops in the South attempted to rescue the American airborne troops in the Nuoshen and Kayu areas along the Indian border and establish contact with them.

One of the most powerful of these armies, advanced to the Lengshui Valley area, and after crossing the Nujiang River, launched a fairly stubborn attack, but finally, on the morning of the 19th, it was repelled by the Japanese army's fierce artillery fire, abandoning more than 200 bodies and fleeing to the east. Now, the army that crossed the river has no other way but to abandon everything and retreat in defeat.</p>
<h3>Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng Returns to Beijing and Announces His Impressions of Inspecting North China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency), Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng departed on the 10th of this month to inspect the judicial situation in North China. After half a month, he returned to Beijing on the 25th. To understand Zhang's trip, the reporter visited Zhang at the Ministry of Judicial Administration today (the 26th), and he was received and briefly told: I departed on the 10th and passed through Beiping. Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, 蚱埠, and other places, spending nine days in Beiping, one day in Tianjin, three days in Jinan, one day in Qingdao, and one day in 蚌埠, and returned to Beijing yesterday (the 25th), with a journey of 16 days. The judicial situation in various places is best in Qingdao, which is also the most complete. There are no unsolved cases, and civil cases can be more effectively mediated. Of the 100 civil cases, more than 60 are mediated and no longer filed. Regarding mediation, there is a mediation committee. For each case, a judge and two 　　 members try their best to persuade, and only when it is unavoidable, they will not allow it to be 　　. This point is the biggest feature of the judicial community in Qingdao. As for Tianjin and other places, the advantages are: There are many old people in various places, who have a considerable reputation in the judicial community, and are very willing to promote judicial administration. 　　　　　 is sufficient. Chairman Wang pays special attention to the 　　　 item and has never delayed it. 　 There is the establishment of a judge training institute, which has now been办至third　　, and 120 people have graduated, all of whom are serving in the judicial community. As for the points that are still being improved, there are 　　　 Since the local environment is special in various places, all laws and regulations cannot be implemented uniformly. I hope that the central government will consider the local situation in various places when formulating laws and regulations in the future. 　　Although the judicial expenses in North China are 17 million Lianyin coupons, the 　　　俸 allocated to the judicial departments in various provinces and cities is not very adequate, so in order to enable the personnel serving in the community to work with peace of mind, it is 　　　 　　 to increase the treatment. 　 The courts and procuratorates in Tianjin and Jinan have not yet been separated.

<h3>Celebrating Allied Naval Day, Naval Minister's Speech: Should Emulate Japan in Building China's Navy</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - Today, the 27th, is the 39th Naval Memorial Day of Allied Japan, and also the third Naval Memorial Day since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Its significance is self-evident. Navy Minister Ren Yuandao specially issued the following statement: Thirty-nine years ago, it was the time when Japan was rising in the world. Especially the Japanese Navy, during the Russo-Japanese War, under the leadership of Admiral Togo, fully demonstrated the traditional spirit of naval officers and men, and achieved the brilliant victory of defeating the entire expeditionary fleet of Imperial Russia, and thus leaped to become the most powerful naval power in the world. This kind of great traditional spiritual power really inspires our infinite respect. Over the decades, the Japanese Navy has strived for self-improvement and continued to endure arduous and fierce training, thus establishing the foundation for today's inevitable victory in war. This is by no means an accidental gain. When we study the reasons for Japan's repeated naval victories, we cannot but respect the great spirit of regarding death as home, the love of the monarch, fierce training, and the active cultivation of internal naval strength. Japanese soldiers can be forged into brave warriors who fight bloody hand-to-hand combat and disregard their own safety, while generals are selfless. I remember that at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War, Admiral Yamagi, the Japanese Naval Minister who commanded the Japanese Navy and grasped the great power of military administration and strategy, once firmly said, "Half of Japan's warships will sink and half of the soldiers will be killed or injured, but the remaining half will surely destroy all Russian warships." This remark is the Japanese traditional spirit, that is, the suicidal tactic.</p>
<p>As for the internal strength of the Japanese Navy, on the one hand, it actively cultivates naval cadres and talents, and on the other hand, it strives for the effectiveness of the quality of warships. Therefore, the number of Japanese naval talents and the excellence of combat technology are far beyond the imagination of the enemy. And the tonnage of Japanese warships and the speed of construction are beyond our ideal. This is definitely not comparable to Britain and the United States. This Greater East Asia War is the final battle of the world's great changes. At present, Allied Japan has controlled the entire combat waters of Greater East Asia. Japan is in an internal combat position. The large and small islands in the Pacific are solid fortresses, and the navy is responsible for protecting its transportation to the mainland. Based on this, attacking the bases of Britain and the United States is also the task of the navy. Therefore, the current task of the Japanese Navy is far greater than that of the Russo-Japanese War. Now half of the naval power of Britain and the United States in the Pacific has been wiped out, and they can only conduct guerrilla-style activities and make false and exaggerated reports to deceive their own people. Because of the loss of British and American naval power, they cannot make various counter-offensive attempts. Although the war has not yet ended, it is inevitable that victory will not belong to Britain and the United States. The Eastern Asian people can win this Greater East Asia War. We admire the power of the Japanese Navy and the old bravery of its naval officers and men. China and Japan share the responsibility of defending East Asia. Looking at the spiritual strength of the Japanese Navy, our naval compatriots should also use it as a mirror for military training. For decades, our country's naval construction work has almost completely stagnated. After the National Government returned to the capital, it actively built the navy. Although this is a very difficult task, there will be no great achievements in the short term, but as long as we persevere and constantly strive, there will always be a day of success. The history of Japan's naval construction is the same as ours today in its early stage. This is our good example. In the future, in addition to actively seeking to strengthen and develop the quality of ships, we must also accelerate the training of a large number of naval cadres and talents in terms of cultivating human resources, so that all of them can be used by the country, so that they can give full play to the power of our navy in this holy war and bear the responsibility for the victory of the war. Recently, in order to train competent naval personnel, the Ministry of the Navy, in addition to the original Central Naval Academy, has specially recruited the first class of merchant marine students, with the aim of training merchant marine crew members to work hand in hand with the navy. Judging from the enthusiasm of those who have signed up, it is enough to prove the ardent expectations of the compatriots across the country for the construction of the new China and the new navy. In the future, the Ministry of the Navy will continue to organize it, and I hope that the outstanding young people from all over the country will actively apply for the examination, so that the naval power of our country can be strengthened. On the occasion of the 39th Naval Memorial Day of Japan, we sincerely wish Japan a complete victory in naval battles, the prosperity of East Asian national fortunes, and jointly look forward to the arrival of the final victory. Army Minister Ye Peng's Broadcast Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - To commemorate the Allied Naval Day, the Propaganda Department held a special broadcast. On the evening of the 26th, Army Minister Ye Peng gave a speech entitled "A View of the Past and Present of Japan's Naval Victory." He briefly stated that the same points in Japan's naval battles in the past and present were: First, sinister conspiracies aroused a desperate struggle. The Japanese Navy's desperate struggle in the Russo-Japanese War was aroused by sinister conspiracies and espionage. Second, the improper way out must be beaten. Third, waiting for work at leisure will surely win. Fourth, recklessly claiming to be naval predecessors will surely be defeated by underestimating the enemy. Fifth, relying on strong armor and sharp soldiers will surely be destroyed. Since Japan's naval battles in the past and present have many of the same points, we can learn from the past and look at the present, and we can predict that Japan's victory in this naval battle will be the same.</p>

Thus, the unified front line of the German army can be completed. The advantages of this cannot be determined at present, but the front line is greatly shortened, which is beneficial to the German army. The German rearguard strongly resisted the attacking American troops everywhere, and fought back with knives, making the enemy's response more cautious. Another important move is that the British attempt to land north of the Nettuno encirclement on Tuesday has been destroyed, and its landing troops, totaling several regiments, have been wiped out.

The enemy army in the areas of Pontecorvo and Piedmont dispatched a strong tank force and made some progress. As a result, the German rearguard had to retreat to the Melfa area.</p>

<h3>Special Edition of the Allied Nation Japan Navy Day, No. 7</h3>
<p>Greeting the 39th Navy Day - Colonel Matsushima's Preface</p>
<p>Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, we are once again greeting the third Navy Day. Observing the trend of the war situation, the enemy's counterattack, which began in August two years ago, has become more intense year by year. Now, the US Pacific Fleet led by Admiral Nimitz and the British-American joint forces commanded by MacArthur are cooperating and echoing each other, trying to advance rapidly from the central breakthrough line across the Marshall Islands, Truk, etc., and the southwestern breakthrough line from the Solomon Islands, Bismarck, and New Guinea northward, in an attempt to break our country's counterattack formation, seek improvement in the war situation, and seize a good opportunity for a decisive battle, with the aim of fatally wounding Greater East Asia. This is the current situation.</p>
<p>In addition, the clamor for opening a second front in Western Europe, which was sung to the skies, has now turned from shouting into reality. Thus, the fate of our Axis nation Germany, like ours, stands at a critical juncture of life and death. This means that the outcome of the war will inevitably reach a decisive stage in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>At this critical moment, greeting the 39th Navy Day has infinite significance. We deeply imprint in our minds the instructions of the predecessors in the Russo-Japanese War, and inherit the glorious achievements of today's foundation of our country's war power. With the traditional spirit accumulated over more than 30 years and the technical power of winning every battle, we must resolutely and severely strike the enemy's general counterattack in order to determine the fate of the Imperial Country and seek the further clarification of Greater East Asia construction.</p>
<p>The following is a brief description of the information provided to our compatriots for reflecting on and understanding the current situation.</p>
<p>The Significance of the Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Changes in Modern Naval Warfare</p>
<p>"Upon receiving the alarm that enemy ships have been discovered, the Combined Fleet immediately set out to sink them. The weather is clear today, but the waves are high." "The fate of the Empire rests on this battle, everyone, strive hard!" Such telegrams and signals that will forever be recorded in history are still vibrating in the eardrums of our Japanese people and impacting our hearts.</p>
<p>The Great Battle of the Sea of Japan on May 27 and 28, 1905, has become a good source of inspiration and encouragement for the Japanese people, strengthening their determination to die for their country. The naval battle at that time, like the Battle of Mukden on land, was the so-called decisive battle that determined the fate of the Russo-Japanese War. I think there is no need to elaborate on this point!</p>
<p>The legacy of the Combined Fleet, which received the Imperial Edict from Emperor Meiji, "Because of your loyalty and valor, you are not ashamed before the spirits of your ancestors, therefore I am very pleased," is immortal and will forever shine in history.</p>
<p>As a result of the naval battle at that time, our country had absolute control of the sea in the Sea of Japan and the Yellow Sea area. Our country's land army supply line was secured, so the land army's operations proceeded without any anxiety. As for Russia, due to the collapse of the navy, direct combat became impossible, and the morale of the people declined, so they abandoned the idea of continuing the war.</p>
<p>The significance of the Battle of the Sea of Japan is indeed so great, and it had a decisive impact on the construction of the Russian navy afterwards, which is easy to judge even from today's situation.</p>
<p>Because for naval construction, from building warships to training sailors, many years are needed, and it cannot be expected to be achieved by hastily throwing together a crew.</p>
<p>However, with the development of modern science, the structure and performance of naval vessels and weapons have become increasingly complex and sophisticated. At the same time, epoch-making progress and development have been made in terms of application, strategy, and tactics. Moreover, the development of aircraft and submarines has become an essential element of maritime power, thus making the battlefield on a wider scale increasingly complex and malevolent. Under what form will the large fleets engage in battles? This is precisely the question that the world is racking their brains over. In such a period, the Greater East Asia War closely followed World War II and was born.</p>
<p>In Europe, the German navy is relatively inferior to the British and American navies. Therefore, the strategy adopted by Germany is the same as in the previous World War, avoiding decisive battles with the main forces as much as possible and focusing on disrupting communication lines or mobile warfare. The Allied Powers of Britain and the United States mainly adopt a blockade strategy. The importance of protecting sea control has not changed now. The sea control of the Mediterranean Sea has already been lost. Looking at the results caused by the wars in Africa and the South Seas today, it is not difficult to imagine. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the great change in naval tactics has been the position of aircraft in naval warfare.</p>
<p>The naval battles in Hawaii and Malaya gave the British and American main fleets a decisive blow in the Pacific. At the same time, the power displayed by aircraft in later naval battles caused Britain and the United States, especially the United States, to change their naval strategy to aircraft-first doctrine, and the formation and strategic form of their fleets were completely changed, with the ideal of air power omnipotence as the foundation for reform. The great navy that the United States had painstakingly built for the past two decades suffered a fatal blow. Now, in order to recover from the setback, they are exerting all their efforts and have successively drafted three expansion plans since the beginning of 1943. Their core goal is to greatly expand aircraft and submarines, because at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States suffered a series of defeats, mainly due to the lack of aircraft. Therefore, President Roosevelt planned to produce 50,000 aircraft per year in his 1940 Congressional message (this number was reached in 1943), with a target of producing 60,000 aircraft in 1942 and 125,000 aircraft in 1943.</p>
<p>At the same time, maritime operations have abandoned the principle of decisive battles with large fleet battles centered on large, heavily armed battleships. Now they focus on mobile warfare with ever-changing aircraft carrier groups, and even temporarily suspended the construction of battleships and focused on the construction of aircraft carriers. Furthermore, in order to make up for their shortcomings, they converted cruisers into escort aircraft carriers, so the United States currently has as many as 45 aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>The operation mainly with aircraft is to conduct decisive battles under air supremacy. Therefore, in addition to engaging in battles with aircraft carrier groups as mobile units, it is also necessary to use air bases to advance operations, the so-called frog-leap operations or island-hopping operations. In this way, since February 1942, the counterattack started in the Solomon Islands and has continued to intensify to this day.</p>
<p>The question we should pay attention to here is whether a decisive battle between all fleets, like the Battle of the Sea of Japan, will occur in future naval warfare.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that water has no constant form, and war has no constant strategy. Therefore, it is really difficult to guarantee under what circumstances a great naval battle of cutting off all means of retreat like in the past will occur. However, we can at least say that the operation method currently adopted by the US Navy focuses on using several aircraft carrier groups to conduct mobile warfare in a ghostly manner, using the strategy of luring the tiger away from the mountain to lure out our country's fleet, and then mainly using the power of aircraft to carry out a method of defeating them one by one. This is an obvious fact.</p>
<p>In the current situation where the progress of aircraft is endless, except for special occasions such as night battles, the victory or defeat of naval battles is mostly determined by the superiority or inferiority of aircraft. Therefore, the future decisive battle is to lure the enemy's main fleet into the maximum utilization circle of our own land-based air bases, and at the same time, we will maximize the use of our naval air power to annihilate them. This point can also be admitted from the perspective of the operational tendency adopted by the US Navy today!</p>
<p>Secondly, what should be noted is that maritime power is only meaningful under the condition of ensuring sea control, and sea control must have value under the premise of ensuring air supremacy. In today's situation, no matter how much the role of maritime power is reduced, the idea that maritime transportation only relies on aircraft is an exaggeration. In short, do not forget that long-term sea control and the transportation of large quantities of materials and troops still rely on ships as the main body.</p>
<p>Due to the development of aircraft and submarines, whether large and expensive warships such as battleships are still necessary in the future has become the focus of controversy. However, since the enemy has a large number of battleships, we certainly also need to maintain a large number of heavy ships. This is to prepare for the ever-changing state of naval warfare.</p>
<p>In short, taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, the state of naval warfare has changed to the form of aircraft-centricism - the form of air combat as the main focus. Therefore, the value of air bases or bases has increased, and at the same time, in order to ensure the base in the outer ocean and guarantee the actions of the fleet, the securing of the replenishment route is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, it has now become a popular period for the use of submarines and anti-submarine warfare methods.</p>
<p>On the one hand, as is prevalent on the European battlefield, the importance of aircraft in protecting commerce or disrupting commerce is increasing. In addition, the emergence of radio wave weapons, magnetic mines, and "rocket" bombs has made naval warfare gradually become a competition of scientific culture and fighting methods. The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia Maritime Operations</p>
<p>On April 10 this year, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King shamelessly said in the House Committee: "In the next six months, the American people must know that there will be great sacrifices in the war against Japan." He also said: "Since the beginning of the war, the US Navy's ships and materials have only now been replenished, and the Japanese Navy will fully realize this in the next few months."</p>
<p>Recently, the US Navy has dispatched mobile units and has twice bombed Truk Island since mid-February this year. In addition, it has attempted to invade Polao Island and Ponape from the air. On the other hand, it also wants to land at Hollandia on the north coast of New Guinea.</p>
<p>According to a Washington telegram on May 10, US Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Nimitz recently met with Southwest Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Halsey and US Fleet Commander Admiral King in San Francisco. The Navy Department's public announcement said that the three giants decided that if there is an opportunity, they hope to completely defeat the Japanese Navy and start an offensive with all their strength.</p>
<p>Such reports are indeed the same old talk of intimidation and rumors. However, many recent promotions have shown the direction of US operations. According to their propaganda and the actions of the fleet, the US Navy intends to conduct a desperate and all-out decisive battle in the near future, and a large-scale attack is imminent. This can be clearly seen.</p>
<p>Why is the United States so eager to seek a decisive battle? The reasons are as follows: First, without a definite war goal, there is no central goal to raise the national war spirit, and the domestic situation has become unsuitable for a protracted war. The repeated strikes in many factories and the exposure of the plan to assassinate Roosevelt fully prove that the situation is not suitable for a protracted war.</p>
<p>Second, domestic production labor has reached its maximum limit. It is not easy to maintain high production this time. According to the statement made by Aircraft Production Minister Wilson, the production rate of US aircraft decreased in April compared to March. In March, 8,730 aircraft were produced. It can also be inferred that the production capacity of the United States will decrease.</p>
<p>Third, observing the form of the war on the India-Burma border, even if we stand on the strategic position of Chongqing and India, there is a need to quickly assist the Asian continent.</p>
<p>Not long ago, part of the US mobile unit participated in the air raid on Sabang in northern Sumatra, which may also contain the intention of this policy.</p>
<p>Fourth, in terms of President Roosevelt's election policy, it is also necessary to achieve a decisive victory before July.</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis, the fundamental reason for not giving Japan time has arisen. Therefore, regardless of everything, they are only eager to pursue a decisive battle. This is an obvious fact.</p>
<p>What is the strategic direction of the US plan? This point, of course, has been openly stated in countless telegrams. Judging from today's trend, it is not difficult to imagine that one route is to pass through the Marshall Islands, Truk Island, and Polao Islands and rush towards the Philippines; the second route is to point directly at the Philippines from the north coast of New Guinea. These two directions are most worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The intention of the United States is to cut off the communication line between the Japanese mainland and the resource area by securing the war contact line from the Philippines to China. In addition, they will advance from the Chinese mainland and launch a decisive attack on the Japanese mainland. This is also a self-evident fact.</p>
<p>In any case, what they rely on is superior aircraft warfare, followed by the landing operations of the surprise attack troops, and then consolidating the base and rushing to the next stronghold. There is no doubt about this tactic.</p>
<p>Recently, the US Air Force on the Chinese mainland has transported a large number of aircraft from India through air transport and expanded its aircraft base, which will cooperate with the attack of US aircraft coming from the ocean.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Pacific Fleet under the command of Nimitz, based in Hawaii, and the US-Australian Allied Forces under the command of MacArthur, with Australia as a springboard, are accumulating strength and sharpening their swords, preparing to advance on the invasion route.</p>
<p>Naturally, do not forget that in parallel with this, there is also a containment battle in the north or through the central Pacific to invade the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>Recently, the Southwest Pacific Fleet under the command of Halsey was defeated in the war and suffered great losses. Therefore, it was finally dissolved and placed under the direct command of Generals Nimitz and MacArthur. Halsey himself was transferred to be the chief of staff of the Pacific Fleet. However, the plan of Halsey, who is called the admiral of the battleship navy, can be imagined to have considerable schemes.</p>
<p>The enemy's blind offensive, the more ripe the time is, the more they will come to invade at any cost. This is what we should know today. At the same time, it is not difficult to imagine that the enemy will launch a large-scale decisive battle in the second half of this year. We can only use the long-standing spirit of Great Japan and the strategic posture of winning every battle to crush the enemy's attack.</p>
<p>The Characteristics of Modern Warfare and Enemy Propaganda</p>
<p>As mentioned above, modern naval warfare mainly uses aircraft and submarines. Another point that needs to be kept in mind is that in conducting wars in such a vast theater, the victory or defeat in a local area is a common occurrence for military strategists. The main thing is that our side has far-sighted plans to defeat the enemy's main force and strive for comprehensive victory. This goes without saying. The enemy uses flowery and false propaganda to deceive the sight and hearing of people all over the world. The propaganda headquarters in London, Washington, Chongqing, and Ceylon are all performing the ugly態 of croaking cicadas in unison.</p>
<p>However, one point needs to be noted, that is, a lie told three times will be considered the truth. At the same time, propaganda that is similar to the war situation can sometimes have a surprising effect.</p>
<p>The fact that the enemy's propaganda is full of falsehood can be seen more clearly from the list of lost submarines in 1942 released on May 10, which shows their contradictions. However, their efforts in carrying out propaganda and the ingenuity of their methods are becoming increasingly sharp with the development of the war situation.</p>
<p>In some cases, they propagate our side's disadvantages in order to depress the people's will to fight.</p>
<p>This kind of propaganda technology requires more intelligence than the power of aircraft and warships, and attacks our country. From the rear far away from the battlefield, its power will directly affect our lives. This point is most worthy of attention. In addition, in parallel with propaganda, there are also so-called strategic wars such as assassination, conspiracy, spreading poison, and sabotage.

<h3>Talk by Commander Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China: Promoting the Traditional Spirit of the Japanese Navy</h3>
<p>Commander Kondo Sotake of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China gave a speech on the occasion of the 39th Navy Day, reflecting on the brilliant significance of the Battle of Tsushima and urging the Imperial Navy to imbue the spirit of that battle into the decisive battle in the Pacific, while urging all ethnic groups in East Asia to rise up together. The content of his speech is recorded below:</p>
<p>Glorious Achievements of Senior Soldiers</p>
<p>I am pleased to meet the 39th Navy Memorial Day during the Great East Asia War. Remembering that the fate of our country was tied to that battle, I am deeply moved by the military achievements of the senior generals and soldiers who fought bravely and defeated strong enemies in the Sea of Japan, deciding the overall situation of the Russo-Japanese War. The great achievements in the naval battle were of course due to the prestige of His Majesty the Emperor and the advice of successive gods, but the Imperial Navy was able to overcome any difficult situation and exert skillful strategies, which cannot be diminished.</p>
<p>The success of Lushun and Incheon at the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War was a great prelude. Subsequently, the Combined Fleet blockaded the enemy's main force in Lushun, echoing the mobile operations of the Urakan Fleet. On May 15, 37th year of Meiji, most of the ships lost once below Chika Island. In the Yellow Sea naval battle on the 10th of the following month, they pursued and fought hard. Today, remembering the ancient hearts of the generals and soldiers of the fleet at that time, makes me feel admiration in my heart. After the Baltic Fleet sailed from the coast, until the capture of Lushun, the whole country was worried, and the cooperation of the army and navy resulted in repeated hard battles, not hesitating major sacrifices, and capturing the Lushun fortress in a short period of time, destroying the enemy fleet there, which was also the main reason for the great victory in the Battle of the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>The War Situation Has Entered the Decisive Battle Stage</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the current war situation in the Greater East Asia, the British and American counterattacks are becoming more and more fierce. Even if we do not mention the words and deeds of enemy leaders such as MacArthur and Nimitz, the foolish temptation of the enemy's mobile units in New Guinea and the southeastern seas of Ogasawara can also be clearly judged as the enemy's counterattack. The enemy has relied on its material strength and adopted the so-called island-hopping tactics, but they are silent about the heavy damage they have suffered, trying to conceal the failure of the decisive battle. Today, they feel that the prolongation of the war is most unfavorable to them, and they intend to form a second battle line in Western Europe as a desperate measure.</p>
<p>From the enemy's movements, anyone can feel that the current war situation has entered a decisive stage, but our Japanese Navy will use the footprints left by our predecessors in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the many difficulties and tactics experienced in the past, as the key to reducing the enemy and completing the posture of being unperturbed in the face of danger.</p>
<p>Important Times, Rise Up Together</p>
<p>The Pacific War situation will determine the future fate of Greater East Asia. Our 100 million Japanese people should rise up together to restore Greater East Asia to its original state. The Republic of China and other East Asian allies, under solid unity, are advancing towards the thorough implementation of the operation, and the day of achieving our goals is not far away.</p>
<p>Japan's combat power, such as the production of aircraft and the construction of warships, has made great progress in all aspects, and is making rapid progress in defeating the enemy. This is of course a manifestation of the Japanese people's spirit of serving the country, as well as the direct and indirect support and cooperation of the peoples of allied countries. I would like to express my deep gratitude here, and I hope to give even greater cooperation. At this time of great turning point in the world, the time is right to promote the youthful spirit of our East Asian nations. I hope that the people of the allied countries will not be deceived by British and American propaganda, and will be self-reliant and go to this important situation together.</p>
<p>Football Tournament, the team will be sent by the liaison office to fight against the Three Provinces. It will be held at the Bian Country Stadium at 5 pm. At that time, the city government and the Secretary-General will be invited to give the opening speech, and Mr. Zuo Tan, the Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, will hold the opening ceremony to show solemnity. The First Police Bureau Band will also be present to play music to enhance the elegance. After the competition, Mr. Wen Lanting will be invited to hold the award ceremony.</p>
<p>According to the battle between the Liaison Office and the Three Provinces, the Liaison Office has returned from the Northern Expedition with a reputation, and its strength has increased. It should be able to give the audience a very good impression. The soldiers of the Three Provinces have been improving their skills in recent years, and they are now encountering</p>
<p>Basketball and Ping Pong, Starting at 5 pm, basketball, volleyball and ping pong performances will be held at the West Qiao Youth Association. Mr. Lin Kanghou will be invited to deliver the opening remarks, and Mr. Yuan Chengdeng (ping pong match), Mr. Shen Zhanliang (volleyball match), and Mr. Zhao Zhengping (basketball match) will present the awards respectively.

<h3>Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting: A Forest of Famous Works: Commander Kondo and Others Visit the Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Second Exhibition of Ancient and Modern Calligraphy and Painting organized by the Continental New Report and this newspaper, in celebration of Japanese Navy Day, was held at the Nan Hwa Mao Hotel on Nanjing Road. It has already been held yesterday morning and those who went to visit were in an endless stream. In the afternoon, Commander Kondo of the Allied Japanese Fleet in China, Naval Attaché Kondo, Chief of the Fleet Reporting Department Colonel Matsushima, and Salt Field Daizuo visited the exhibition. President Oizumi of Daiichi Shimbun, Special Director Akamatsu, and President Chen of this newspaper personally received them. Although only 200 pieces of paintings are displayed this time, they are all precious collections of maritime collectors, as well as carefully crafted masterpieces by modern masters. The ancient supervisors range from the Song Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, and all have famous works, such as the landscape pavilion map of Wang Wei in the book Dynasty, the Lihua Magpie Map of Huang Quan in the Five Dynasties, the Ancient Wood and Bamboo Stone Map of Ni Yunlin in the Yuan Dynasty, and the Autumn Mountain Xiao Temple Map of Wang Shuming, all of which are extremely valuable works, which are not easily seen outside. The exhibition period is for one week, until the 29th.</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News: Practical Calligraphy Competition</h3>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Committee believes that the calligraphy of general students is poor. When they first enter society, the writing is ugly and unsightly, or the writing is too slow, which hinders service efficiency. Therefore, it specially holds a "Practical Calligraphy Competition" to create guidance. However, this competition focuses on the word "practical," with neatness, affection, agility, and the ordinary calligraphy competition are different. The following are the simple rules:</p>
<p>Participants in the competition are limited to the current aided students in the senior primary school and junior high school groups. Participants should prepare a piece of white paper 12 inches high and 8 inches wide, divided into 8 lines, regardless of horizontal lines, and write the full text of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will, in regular script or running script. The competition is divided into two groups, Mao Pen and Pen, and participation is free. (You can participate in both groups.) On the left, write the school, grade, name, age, and registration number of the scholarship in this session, and the teacher should ask for help to prove it. The solicited methods must be sent to the "Shen Bao Let Scholarship Office" before June 4, and will be invalid if overdue. The solicited calligraphy will be reviewed by this office. The first round will select 15 people from each grade, and they will be notified to come to the second round to avoid cheating and observe their speed. Ten people will be selected from each grade and given awards on a regular basis to show encouragement.</p>
<p>Mingzhe School Health Speech, The school health speech sponsored by Mu Chu will be held tomorrow (Sunday) at 10:00 am. The first speech will be given by Mr. Chuantong, "The Scientific View of the Universe." The location is at Xinzha Road Elementary School. I hope that aided students above high school will come to listen with the tickets. In addition, due to postal delays, those who have not received the lectures can arrive early.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Association Holds Music and Film Conference to Celebrate Allied Navy Day</h3>
<p>In order to celebrate the Allied Navy Day, the China Broadcasting Association and the China Film Company jointly held a grand music and film conference at the Majestic Theatre yesterday (26th) at 1:30 pm. More than 2,000 people from the Allied Fleet Reporting Department Salt Tian Dajie, Shanghai Broadcasting Station Director Chen Zhengzhang, and all walks of life came, and the grand occasion was unprecedented and the feelings were enthusiastic. Shanghai Broadcasting Station broadcast the event on the spot. First, Chen Zhengzhang, Director of Shanghai Broadcasting Station, delivered an opening speech, followed by Yan Tian Dazuo's speech entitled "The Time for Decisive Battle is Approaching, We Must Decisively Obtain the Final Victory." The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra then performed famous songs, and the film "Ambition Lingling" was screened at the end. The film fully demonstrates the spirit of sacrifice of the Allied Navy, and the audience was deeply moved.</p>
<p>Yan Tian Dajie's Speech</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, it has been the third Navy Memorial Day. At this memorable time, I am very honored to have the opportunity to talk about the current situation of the war, organized by the China Broadcasting Association and the China Film Company to celebrate Navy Day.</p>
<p>Unprecedented 40 Years Ago</p>
<p>Forty years ago from now, General Togo of our country, Japan, led the Combined Fleet and attacked the Russian "Baltic" Fleet in the Sea of Japan, winning an unprecedented victory in the history of the world war. Of the enemy's fleet of 38 ships, only two sailed to "Vladivostok", and the remaining 36 were either sunk by us or captured by us. More than 6,000 prisoners were taken, starting with the commander. At this time, our losses were only three torpedo boats. There are of course various reasons why we were able to achieve such a victory. Now let me talk about them.</p>
<p>The first is to break Russia's ambition to dominate East Asia and preserve our right to survival. The second is that the people of our country, Japan, can fully understand that the victory or defeat of this war can determine the prosperity or decline of Japan, so they concentrate all their strength on this war from top to bottom. The third is that every soldier is filled with the spirit of dying for the country. This state of Japan forty years ago is the state of Japan today. The only difference is that the enemy is not Russia, but Britain and the United States. The battlefield is not Manchuria, but the vast Pacific. But the purpose of the war and the determination of the people are the same. The ambition of the enemy, Britain and the United States, to make trouble is extremely clever compared to the stupid Russia. The scale is as large as it can be. Judging from history, the modern history of Asia is also the history of our ancestors excluding the forces of Britain and the United States with blood. Since the beginning of the modern colonial movement in Britain, for 300 years, our ancestors were their slaves and were driven by them, just like the occupation of India and Burma, and the Treaty of Nanjing, the Treaty of Beijing, and the Treaty of Tianjin. If we intend to count the history of the invasion of Asia by the British and Americans, we will never be able to count them with ten fingers. Unfortunately, we Asians have not realized that we have great power, and we have also been tricked by the enemy, turning our lives into opium and gradually eliminating ourselves. In this Greater East Asia that is gradually heading towards extinction, Japan eliminated the Russian fleet and won a great victory, thus awakening the nations of Greater East Asia from their dreams. From then on, Greater East Asia began a spiritual struggle against Britain and the United States. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Since Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, all Asian nations have wanted to establish an independent movement to break Europe. The place where this trend is going will probably be the union of Asian nations." Since the Battle of Tsushima, the Japanese Navy has taken on the important task of monitoring the British and American invasion of East Asia from the sea based on historical inevitability, so the war between Japan and Britain and the United States became a historical destiny forty years ago.</p>
<p>American Ambition Completely Exposed</p>
<p>However, Japan had to avoid war for the sake of world peace, so after preparing everything properly, it sent two representatives, Nomura and Kurisu, to the United States for the final peace negotiations. However, the United States treated us as congenital slave nations, believing that the United States' invasion of East Asia was a matter of course from the perspective of world peace, and threatened us with their American-style views. As a result, our efforts were in vain and the talks broke down. Based on the above points, Japan's war goals are clear and obvious. It is indeed a heaven-priced defense operation, and it is a so-called just war to free Greater East Asia from the British and American pirate colonial policies. Japan's war goals cannot be attacked by anyone, but why are the British and Americans fighting? The enemy soldiers said: "The object of the war is very clear, but why do we need to fight?" The biggest goal of the enemy's scholars is to turn Greater East Asia into South America, and they use slogans such as "for democracy," "for humanity," and "for freedom" to force the people to die in battle. But it is doubtful how long this situation can continue. The collapse of hegemony is obvious in history, and the United States' ambition to dominate the new world is no exception. The kind American people, watching the reality of their country, have fully understood what American democracy is and what American humanity means. Therefore, there is now internal strife in the United States and the United Nations. Racial antagonism and frequent strikes in the United States are real examples. Even in the United Nations, there are issues such as the Americanization of British territory, the silent war between the United States and the Soviet Union, and the mutual suspicion between Britain and the Soviet Union. The American leadership, which has no war goals, continues to be in internal strife.</p>
<p>Sacrifices Major, Counterattack Begins</p>
<p>However, because the United States is a country that exaggerates material strength, it was temporarily stunned after the defeat at Pearl Harbor and the loss of various bases in the Pacific at the beginning of the war. Since January of the year before last, it has used all its strength to reorganize the navy and began a major counterattack against Japan. Now let's talk about the enemy's counterattack. The American Navy is from Hawaii, through the Marshall Islands, Torac, Guam, Manila, to China, that is, so-called central New Guinea, the so-called South Nymity, and the commander of the United Joint Forces in the Southwest Pacific, MacArthur, wants to use the mobile units of the aircraft carrier group to occupy each stronghold in turn, and when possible, he intends to use the so-called leaping war to fight a decisive battle with our country, Japan's fleet in one fell swoop, and then invade China, using China as a battlefield. However, the enemy's operation has only occupied a few small islands after a year and nine months, but the damage they have suffered in terms of personnel and materials has been a great sacrifice. Since January 30 last year, the enemy has been shouting the Nimitz offensive, regardless of the great sacrifice. According to the estimate, the number of books the enemy has suffered in terms of people, even if only looking at the sea, is as many as 298,000. In terms of naval warfare, they have suffered a defeat, and a part of New Britain and the Solomon Islands are still in our possession. All the land forces are concentrated in New Guinea, and their operations cannot be carried out according to plan, but have become a good target for our air force. Looking at the Indian Ocean, the British General Mountbatten and the American General Stilwell abandoned the Burmese counterattack due to disagreement on operations, and moved the headquarters to Sikkim, but for the sake of their own face, they sent a part of the mobile units to Sumatra, so there is simply nothing to say about the enemy's tactical intent in this regard. As mentioned above, the enemy wants to fight a decisive battle with Japan regardless of the great sacrifice. What is the reason why the American army insists on its own desired operations, even breaking the operations methods of other joint chiefs? This is a very interesting question.</p>
<p>Four Reasons for Urgently Wanting a Decisive Battle: I think the reasons why the United States is so eager for a decisive battle are:</p>
<p>First, because there is no firm war goal, there is no central goal to boost the national will to fight, so the prolongation of the war is easy to cause turmoil in the United States, just like the continuous strikes in the factory, and the incident of planning to kill Roosevelt. These are all signs of domestic unrest, and because of the great sacrifice of American soldiers, the conscription of young people has become a reason to fuel the war atmosphere. Due to the destruction of the countryside and the relocation of many people of different races, various social problems have arisen. As a result, the people have seen clearly the current war situation and simply do not believe in the slogans of "for justice" and "for democracy" shouted by the leaders.</p>
<p>Second, domestic production has reached its maximum limit, and there is no hope for future increases. The loan of weapons, and the reduction of the loan of weapons, can become the reason why the United States cannot win over the United Nations, so it must win immediately.</p>
<p>Third, from a political and legal point of view, Chongqing and India must be prevented from defecting from now on. As far as possible, a connection route with the mainland should be established as soon as possible, because this is also the reason for controlling Greater East Asia in the future.</p>
<p>Fourth, Roosevelt hopes to be elected for the fourth time when the president is elected this autumn, so he must win a major victory to change the national interest. From a military point of view, anxiety is the most cautious thing, and anxious people will fail. The United States initially announced that it would take a long time to defeat Japan, but now it hopes most for a time war.</p>
<p>The enemy hopes for short-term operations. Then the enemy's engine has increased several times, and this heavy industry is continuing to be established in the south. Third, the bases occupied by Japan are extremely fortified and strengthened month by month. The long-term war will only increase the sacrifice of the United States. Fourth, Japan maintains its human power and waits for the consumption of American troops before launching a counterattack. Fifth, the recent international situation is even more subtle, and it is simply unpredictable to study why the changes are so rapid. Sixth, Asia is gradually moving towards unity. Based on the above reasons, the enemy is eager to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet, but in fact it is the Japanese Navy that holds the key to the decisive battle. When the Japanese Navy gives them the opportunity for a decisive battle based on their wishes, then the United States will suffer a major defeat, just like the Battle of the Sea of Japan forty years ago. I have said before that the ultimate goal of the United States is to conquer Greater East Asia, and its central goal is actually China. The plan of the United States is to advance to China first and use China's conditions in terms of personnel and materials to defeat Japan. At the same time, it monopolizes post-war China, just like monopolizing the Chongqing Air Force and taking over the guidance power in Chongqing. These are all to achieve his plan.</p>
<p>Confident of Victory</p>
<p>Colonel Kana of the US Army said in his book "American Attack Operations": "If there is no real base in Asia, the United States cannot maintain its position in the Far East." Now let me briefly explain what methods the American leaders use to deceive the people and make the people care about Greater East Asia. From a historical point of view, the American people must care about Europe, and in order to make the people's concern turn to East Asia, they sing the song of defeating Germany first. The people of Britain and the United States think this is a matter of course, but Chongqing and Australia and New Zealand have launched fierce opposition. Of course, the leaders of the American conquest of East Asia have long anticipated this opposition, which is what they want. On the one hand, the US government sent the diplomatic delegation Wilkie to Chongqing to promote the importance of East Asia to the people. After the completion of this plan, Roosevelt declared that the Pacific must be valued, held the Quebec Conference, and invaded China according to the plan; now it is expelling the forces of Britain and the Soviet Union and creating a solid force in Chongqing, as explained above. We have established the historical destiny of fighting against Britain and the United States forty years ago, and this historical destiny has now become a reality, and fierce battles are being fought everywhere. But we should re-recognize why the enemy is so eager to fight a decisive battle and why they are advancing into China. In this decisive battle period, the main fleet of the Japanese Navy is silently waiting for the maturity of the opportunity for a decisive battle. We have full awareness that in this decisive battle, we will definitely win and break the innate superiority of the British and Americans as Asian fighting peoples. I am now reintroducing it to you.</p>

<h3>Navy Memorial Day Special - Continued from Page Two</h3>
<p>When the war situation is temporarily unfavorable, this kind of propaganda can have the effect of dry wood meeting a raging fire. Looking back at the examples of the last World War, as well as the Netherlands and Belgium in this current war, proves that this theory is not absurd. Moreover, when the feeling of lacking essential necessities of life arises, it becomes easier to accept enemy propaganda.</p>
<p>American Concepts of Espionage and Military Strategy</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Gannett of the United States Army and military commentator, once said the following in his book "The Offensive Operation of the United States":</p>
<p>"The day Japan launched the September 18th Incident was the day the United States made its final decision on whether to maintain or relinquish the Philippines as a naval and air base. If the United States had decided to maintain it, it should have immediately expressed a firm determination to suppress Japan. That was the time when the United States could have truly striven for a foothold on the mainland in the Far East. If war had been declared with Japan at that time, the United States would have easily defeated Japan. As a result, China could have become a protectorate, and China could have been developed with a continental spirit. Aircraft factories and military airfields could have been established throughout the Far East, and strategic raw materials could have been accumulated on the Chinese mainland base. At least 300,000 American troops could have been stationed in China." He also said, "If there is no true mainland base in Asia, the military position of the United States in the Far East cannot be maintained at all."</p>
<p>Even without looking back at the past of Theodore Roosevelt and John Hay, it is not difficult to imagine what kind of ambitions the United States has for the Far East and China.</p>
<p>However, do not forget that when realizing these ambitions, they are filled with the blood of their pioneer ancestors and possess a tenacious character.</p>
<p>They always regard seizing the world's largest land area as glorious, which is their consistent tradition.</p>
<p>Do not forget that they use strength, effort, and perseverance to strive for their own happiness and prosperity. During the Civil War, they burned to the ground the homes, fields, warehouses filled with food, and pastures filled with livestock of the Southern army in the Virginia area of the same nation, and inflicted extreme cruelty on killing the old, young, and women. In short, their nature is that any sacrifice is worth it for their own happiness and prosperity.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Gannett said, "There is no absolutely unbreakable battle line in the world, and there is no navy that cannot cross the ocean." Then he added:</p>
<p>"If the United States abandons its defensive strategy of being bound hand and foot, it can begin to implement surprise attacks with a sense of reality, and will not be bound by pre-printed operational plans. At any time, it can seize fleeting opportunities, use America's abundant internal resources, and create ingenious and flexible operational techniques to attack the enemy wherever it is advantageous. Only offensive operations under the guidance of an offensive spirit, and America's abundant material resources, are the path to victory."</p>
<p>Regarding the situation when the book was published on January 2, 1942, he concluded: The war has already reached the stage of stopping ineffective offensives against the Axis powers, and should adopt a decisive offensive stage.</p>
<p>The possibility of taking a decisive offensive against the Axis powers is based on the democratic nations acquiring maritime and air supremacy.</p>
<p>Taking maritime and air supremacy as the basic conditions, consolidating their own firm foothold on the continent, and resolutely adopting an offensive war policy, this is the only way for the American offensive strategy advocated by Gannett.</p>
<p>Based on this, when judging the current situation in the Pacific War, we must bear in mind that their fierce attacks on us will be a hundred times more cruel than the savage behavior of plundering the American continent.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has already approached the decisive battle stage.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as indicated in the declaration of war, is to "ensure the stability of East Asia and the peace of the world." Today, based on the long history of our nation's founding, "cherishing friendships with all nations and sharing the joy of co-prosperity with all countries," according to the fundamental principles of this imperial diplomacy, as declared by His Majesty, it is a sacred war to "develop and expand the legacy of our ancestors."</p>
<p>As indicated in the teachings of Emperor Jinmu, it is nothing more than His Majesty's wish to "respond to the virtues bestowed by the gods of heaven and earth, and to promote the righteous heart of the imperial grandson."</p>
<p>Spreading justice to all nations, establishing the national policy of Japan, allowing all nations to be in their proper places, and restoring East Asia to its natural beauty, this is the bright and just goal of this holy war that will be recorded in history forever.</p>
<p>We are in this aerial war drama launched in the year 1601 of the imperial era, according to the spirits of the various nations that have been passed down by the Japanese people since Emperor Jinmu, determined to establish a permanent foundation within the Greater East Asia region during this greatest leap forward.</p>
<p>Compared to England and the United States, which are enslaving the East Asian nations and exploiting the East Asian ideals for their own ambitions and prosperity, there is a fundamentally different point. A prodigal son who spends his time drinking and indulging in pleasure, squandering his ancestors' inheritance without any ability, and doing anything for his own selfish desires, and the self-destructive madness of despair, are completely different from us Japanese.</p>
<p>Therefore, we Japanese who "stand upon the spirits," every move we make is a manifestation of divine will, and at the same time, the unwavering national determination and the firm belief in victory to kill the enemy are all based on this.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine years ago, the tenth descendant of Otomo Mononobe, who carried the fate of the imperial nation on his shoulders and engaged in a desperate battle, is now in a time of nationwide all-out effort to cut down the strange island demons that attempt to cover the world with their giant wings, holding the divine spear and unsheathing the sword.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the nation depend on this one battle."</p>
<p>We must each fulfill our greatest responsibility as citizens in our respective professional positions, and ensure that the purpose of the holy war is thoroughly achieved.</p>
<p>Marshal Togo's qualifications and words say: "Do not fear the great enemy, do not insult the small enemy, do not constantly hope that the enemy will not come, but be prepared to deal with them at all times, and never allow the enemy to take advantage of us. Negligence is a great enemy; even for a brief moment, do not be negligent in vigilance." He also said: "The gods only bestow honor and favor on those who devote themselves to peacetime training and win without fighting."</p>
<p>Shine brightly on the Yamato Island in the grassland, when the time comes, slay the demons.</p>
<h3>Marshal Togo - Collection of Golden Sayings</h3>
<p>Victory or Defeat Lies in the Spirit of the Commander</p>
<p>In essence, if the fleet battles are to be conducted one by one according to orders, it is bound to be circuitous and misguided. The entire army must look up to the attitude of the commander and follow his example to achieve a great victory. The commander is the guide and beacon for the entire army, not merely a loud-mouthed commander. I hope that those who command our main forces will serve as models for the entire army in their duties.</p>
<p>Enemy in Dire Straits</p>
<p>In wartime, we must have the concept that even if the enemy is many times stronger, they will still be in dire straits. Ancient strategists used this as a basis for a "seven-three" approach to battle, meaning that if you think of it as seven parts for the enemy and three parts for us, in reality it is five parts for each.</p>
<p>Constant Warfare</p>
<p>The life of a warrior is a continuous war, differentiating the importance of their duties by the battles they fight in peacetime. When things happen, exert military force; when things are calm, cultivate yourself; be consistent from beginning to end, and just strive to fulfill your duty.</p>
<p>Constant Training and Cultivation in Peacetime</p>
<p>Victory is in the mind. Peacetime training and determination are most important. You must always remember that peacetime training and constant cultivation are the most important things.</p>
<p>One cannon that hits the target one hundred times out of one hundred is better than one hundred cannons that hit the target once out of one hundred.</p>
<p>Belief</p>
<p>The gods surely bestow honor and favor on those who devote themselves to peacetime training and win without fighting; as for those who are content with a single victory and rest easy in times of peace, they will immediately be deprived of it.</p>
<p>Negligence is the Greatest Enemy</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of the great enemy, do not insult the small enemy, do not always rely on the fact that they have not come, but wait for them at all times, and there will never be anything that cannot be discovered.</p>
<p>Negligence is the greatest enemy. Even for a brief moment, do not be negligent in vigilance!</p>
<p>Invisible Strength</p>
<p>Military strength is not only about rations, troops, etc., but also about utilizing these invisible strengths.</p>
<p>Aggressive Offense is the Best Defense</p>
<p>Once battle has been joined, there is no need for defense. An aggressive offense is the best defense.</p>
<p>Certain Victory and No Defeat</p>
<p>The concept of victory or defeat is something that comes before the battle. Once bayonets are crossed, you must never think about victory or defeat. Those who think of defeat are sure to lose. (End of Full Text) (Ji Qing)</p>
