<p>社評</p>
<h3>實事求是莫作調人</h3>
<p>「實事求是，莫作調人」，這是定海黃以周先生主講江陰南菁書院時的座右銘。黃先生在淸末光緖年間主請南菁書院十五年，他憤於淸末政治腐敗，社會人士，競尙虛浮，習於敷衍，因此提出這八個字作為座右銘，訓導學子為學做人之道·南菁書院所造就的大都是樸學之士，可以說受這八個字的影響不小。</p>
<p>這八個字最大的意義在乎澈底的辨別是非。是者是之，非者非之，是非之間不容有絲毫的假借，不容有絲毫的取消，更沒有法子可以永嘉和。和學做人，要辨別是非，是非旣明，是者從之，非者去之，要態度鮮明，不能模稜兩可，不能隨波逐流。這樣，方才不愧為大丈夫，方才對得起自己，對得起社會和國家</p>
<p>實事求是就是脚踏實地的把事實來證明是非，是最最合乎科學的方法。第一，事實勝過一切雄　，凡是有事實證明的然　可以稱為眞正的是，或眞正的非。沒有事實證明的，無論表面上有任何方式的表現，終究不是眞正的是非。第二，實事求是純粹是理智作用，不滲入情感行動，更不受情感的牽制。凡是經過理智所判決的然後是眞正的眞理，其他凡是由情感或受情感影響而決定的，必不是眞正的眞理。所以，實事求是，最注重理智，最注重事實證明。</p>
<p>明辨是非之後，就要判斷是非。是非中間是無法中立，無法調和的，所以判斷的結果，只有一個是，一個非，莫作調人的意思，就是要叫人明明白白說出眞是非。要有不怕得罪人家的勇氣，要無所顧慮，耍富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈。調人每每因為要討好於人，有意無意地抹殺是非，不做調人的人，認定是非是至高無上，所以在任何環境之下，指够不顧一切，大胆地判定出來。</p>
<p>用理智去求有事實證明的眞是非，把眞是非明明白白的判定，這是最最合乎科學的近代精神。這種精神，處在中國目前的局勢，更為需要。中國國家社會的社會的大毛病第一就在是非不明，第二就在有眞是非而沒有人敢說。是非不明的結是要，是鼓勵人家去作惡。有眞是非而沒有人敢說，等於沒有眞是非，結果是喪失人家行善的勇氣。這樣的社會，那裏能夠安定，那裏能夠進步。我們從事新聞事業的人，耳聞目睹的經一般人多一些，特別這幾年來，看到全國上下，是非不明的風氣，釀成國家社會的不安，更足貽害於將來民族的生存。譬如政治上沒有了是非，則貪污橫行，廉吏屈抑，或不能稱職的官吏，不即免撤，而予調任，形成　行　　的局面。社會上沒有了是非，則投機營利趨之若鶩，公益事業，觀望不前，形成唯利是圖的局面。眞是「心所謂危，不敢不言」。我們所以不避忌諱，屢屢直言指陳得，希望造成社會風氣，使一般人都能夠明辨是非，希望全國上下都能夠「實事求是，莫作調人」。</p>
<h3>阿拉坎山岳戰缐　日印軍冒雨進攻　伊姆法爾平原虞機已迫切</h3>
<p>仰光十一日中央社電　東部緬印國境戰綫，已進入雨季，阿拉坎山岳地帶三百公里之戰塲，連日大雨傾盆，日印同盟軍冒此驟雨猛攻敵軍，其勇氣愈激昻，馬尼布爾之雨季，較阿拉坎約旱一月，較夫公溪谷約遲一月，自「世界屋脊」喜馬拉亞而下之東北季節，均向西方之低氣壓境，因此，阿薩密州之四月時起强烈之西風，故引起東北之驟雨，此種雷雨交作之景風雨，時向阿拉坎山野襲來，馬尼布爾降雨量，一年平均六十時，伊姆法爾百五十公里西方之西倫，一年之雨量平均為五百二十時，為世界如雨之地，故通稱此地為雨之世界，伊姆法爾之雨，四月中約降十日，五月中約降十五日，六月中約二十日，降雨日數逐次增加。馬尼布爾盆地化為池沼，溫度亦隨雨季而昇高，日印同盟軍即於此自然環境下，展開擊破英美並殲滅戰。</p>

<p>緬甸戰綫某地十一日中央社電　伊姆法爾平原之決戰益形緊迫，敵軍為對抗北方山岳地區日軍之壓力，在巴列爾東北方布成最後之防綫，在南方以巴列爾四周為防衛重點，繼續竭力抗戰，巴列爾為伊姆法爾平原東南之要塞，後靠洛哥丹克湖濕地一軍事要衝，故巴列爾之爭奪戰，實為法定伊姆法爾會戰之　　。日軍奪回伊姆要塞後，乘續行進攻基彭，欣摩爾，迪　普爾各地，步步進迫巴列爾，六日巳與巴列爾耍塞之敵軍展開激戰。日軍先鋒部隊巳迫近巴列爾十公里，兩軍之砲聲隆隆，巴列爾巿內外之敵，於巴列爾集結第二十師，主力約一萬二千人及砲兵部隊。又於巴列爾飛機塲方面，敵軍企圖最後抵抗，日軍對此則又因哥希馬，伊姆法爾之間公路增加壓力，直接威脅伊姆法爾。又由北方十公里之曼爾本高地區前進，衝抵伊姆法爾平原之東方高地，遂展開激烈之山岳戰。又日軍北上部隊，繼續佔領齊卡亨，達姆，刻進迫伊姆法爾平地門戶，面積僅一千方公里之伊姆法爾平原，現在戰機已迫矣。</p>
<h3>阿孟鐵道　受重大威脅</h3>
<p>印度前綫十一日中央社電　日印同盟軍攻略哥希馬以後，阿薩密至孟加拉鐵道，即受重大威脅。按該鐵路係阿薩密孟加拉兩省聯絡孔道，為東北部印度之一大動脈，倘該鐵路被遮斷，則阿薩密及孟加拉兩省必陷於痺　狀態。該鐵道以孟加拉省吉大港為起點，經阿薩密省之卡齊爾刻山脈，迄向東北，經布拉馬普得拉盆地之南方，而至薩的　，該綫全長約達一千米，在大東亞戰爭發生之前後，曾積極運輸軍隊及軍火。該綫除有由巴達爾布爾至西爾基鉅之支綫外，並由其他支綫數條，聯絡各主要地區，最主要者有下列三綫，一為爾姆基恩至哥哈齊之支綫，該支綫乃聯絡阿薩密孟加拉鐵路及西部地區大幹綫之東印孟加拉鐵道，聯絡孟加拉與阿義密州之交通。一為丹斯基至梯布爾加爾之支綫，梯布爾加爾位於布拉馬普得拉河沿岸，為縣政府之所在地，水陸交通之要衢，由布拉馬普得拉河連結阿薩密至孟加拉鐵道之幹綫。一為丹斯基至來多支之綫，該支綫係為開發北部阿薩密之煤礦及油田而敷設者，該地自昔即為阿薩密緬甸間之商業地，同時阿關密至中國間之商業路錢，亦經由該綫、</p>

<p>東綫戰况</p>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電，海通社訊，日來東綫南段激戰方酣，中段及北段則無特殊事件發生，蘇軍雖屢次進展，德軍仍能按照計劃而撤退，行動未受妨害，克里米亞境內又有戰事，蘇軍進攻培里柯浦及普特利德海邊之德軍陣地，奮鬥多時，祗能在培爾柯浦地　突破一口，仍在力戰中。由奧迪薩撤退之德軍，行動從容不迫，彼方蘇軍進展甚緩，塔諾波爾之德軍盡力抗戰，終以衆寡懸殊，復遭排砲猛轟之故，不得不退出該城，東部他處進犯之敵巳被擊退，那瓦迤西之德軍，重創蘇軍，敵兵一師被殲滅。</p>

<h3>墨總統遇剌</h3>

<h3>羅德斯島兩岸英軍登陸被殲</h3>

<h3>瑪尼普爾平原上展開解放印度的決戰</h3>
<p>載新印姆法爾與哥希瑪後方兵站聯絡綫的某日軍有力部隊，二十九日陸續進迫該綫，威脅敵第四軍團，並從背後扼制印姆法爾，確立了總攻擊態勢。二十八日夜，以在密勛截斷哥希瑪道的先鋒隊為前導，日軍諸有力部隊於二十九日占領印姆法爾北方三十公里的地點，更據敵司令部公報，日軍部隊業巳破壞印姆法爾，哥希瑪道上的橋樑，敵後方兵站綫全被日軍各部蹂躪顧總攻印姆法爾的態勢，將近完成。</p>
<p>戰事入最高潮</p>
<p>協力印度國民軍的日軍，踏入印度的密林不過十數日，戰事巳經進入最高潮的塲而了。戰局將起極大的變化，新戰塲將展開在三百年來受英國支配的印度土地上。由於精細周密的行動，日軍的戰略，打破了敵方在緬甸各戰綫所布置下的陣綫，至此一變而為解放印度的攻勢戰，在這一次的　尼普爾平原大會戰中，有進攻印度的日軍，有重路祖國土地的印度國民軍，而在另一方面，有死守瑪尼普爾平原的英第四軍團，並有在槍尖下的被强制殘殺同胞的印度兵，基情形的深刻複雜，無論那一個戰綫無與倫比，而為全世界所注目。</p>
<p>昔日在東方文明史上曾大放光明，而今日呻吟在英國三世紀來支配下的印度，以此戰為轉機而激變。敵力陣綫的動搖與混亂，就是這重大的日子到來的徵兆。英美兩國統帥的對立與摩擦，重慶的失望與不安，惴惴於印度前途的英國朝野與印度民衆的動搖，——這些就是在對立的泥沼中徬徨的現狀。</p>
<p>敵方戰略失敗</p>
<p>敵三統帥部的分裂「奪回緬甸」是奎貝克會談以來敵方最重要的戰略。如尼米資所說：「要覆滅日本的生產力，須空襲日本本土」，因此，無論如何，必須「確保華南沿岸的空軍基地」，而其前提則為奪回緬甸。自起用蒙特巴頓以後，在開羅會談中所商定的計劃，實敵在緬甸的周圍集中大兵力，用外綫包圍的攻擊，來打破處於內綫的日方防衛，重開萊多公路，計劃完成聯絡印度—緬甸—重慶的戰略幹綫。但一切都絕望了，戰局的　慶完全相反。諸軍的兵力，在二個月內，完全被日軍精銳各個擊破了。</p>
<p>不僅如此，過了本月，是一切不能不放棄的六個月的雨季。敵方對立分裂，以此情勢為背景而爆發。從美國統帥部看來，蒙特巴頓是不足恃的，重慶亦非難英軍的作戰不力。三統師部巳喪失了彼此互相信　的感情，因而有此次日軍作戰所造成的歸結。</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓與史蒂成爾的會談（三月十五日），就是想暫時取得妥協。但會談後隔了四天，日軍就進入印度，事態急轉直下，英軍所最恐懼的現實，終於臨到了。</p>
<p>印度的運命　對日軍的進出印度，敵方也完全分裂。關於此次大會戰的地點印姆法爾美國朝野閉着眼睛說是無價値的。但那顯然是色厲內荏。美軍不會不知道，駐渝空軍唯一的補充路，巳受重大的威脅。但問題是對協約軍英軍的不信任，而英國的煩悶則是很深刻的。歐慶萊克率直地說：「英軍並沒有將印姆法爾平原棄之於日軍的意思，事實上形勢不那樣嚴重。」但那重大的會戰之機快迫近了。但英軍監視下印兵的投降，印度國內的大動搖，印度中央議會的否泱印度政廳的增稅案，總督華維爾說：「印度國民不從事印度的防衛，」可是印度國民早巳看透了所謂防衛印度的眞正的方策是什麼。</p>
<p>世界正義所趨</p>
<p>在這情勢下，我們不禁想起三月二十二日東條首相之歷史的談話：「帝國的目的，乃在擊破敵勢力，將印度完全委之於印度人。國民軍所進攻的祖國印度的土地，立即置於自由印度臨時政府的行政下……印度的獨立，乃亞洲的全體意志，且為世界正義之赴屆。」迫促的印姆法爾總攻擊，瑪尼普爾平原上的大會戰，包孕着種種歷史的要素，而即將展開了。（翔：婦自四月三日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>老閘分局破獲　冒充軍人騙案　希望市民安分守己</h3>
<p>邇來本市一般脊小之徒，竟冒充軍人，僞稱「中華自治軍第五軍」名義，僞印大批委令徽軍職官證等物件，公開出賣，並在界內招搖撞騙，無所不爲，擾亂治安，爲害匪淺，第一警察局接獲密報後，當令飭各分局嚴密偵查，老閘分局當於數日內連獲二案。茲將詐情分記於後：</p>

        <h1>1944.04.12</h1>
<h3>Don't Be a Mediator, Seek Truth from Facts</h3>
<p>"Don't be a mediator, seek truth from facts," this was the motto of Mr. Huang Yizhou of Dinghai when he presided over the Jiangyin Nanqing Academy. Mr. Huang presided over the Nanqing Academy for fifteen years during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. He was indignant at the corruption of the late Qing Dynasty politics and the social figures who competed for vanity and were accustomed to perfunctoriness. Therefore, he put forward these eight characters as his motto to guide the students in the way of learning and being a human being. The Nanqing Academy mostly cultivated scholars of solid learning, which can be said to be greatly influenced by these eight characters.</p>
<p>The greatest significance of these eight characters lies in the thorough discernment of right and wrong. To call right what is right, and wrong what is wrong, there must be no slightest pretense between right and wrong, no slightest cancellation, and no way to reconcile them. To learn and be a human being, one must distinguish between right and wrong. Once right and wrong are clear, follow what is right and abandon what is wrong. One must have a clear attitude, avoid ambiguity, and avoid following the crowd. Only in this way can one be worthy of being a great man, and only in this way can one be worthy of oneself, society, and the country.</p>
<p>Seeking truth from facts is to prove right and wrong by grounding oneself in reality. It is the most scientific method. First, facts speak louder than eloquence. Anything that can be proven by facts can be called true right or true wrong. Anything that is not proven by facts, no matter how it manifests itself on the surface, is ultimately not true right or wrong. Second, seeking truth from facts is purely an intellectual exercise, without the intrusion of emotion or action, and even less subject to emotional constraints. Anything that is judged by reason is the true truth, while anything that is determined by emotion or influenced by emotion is not the true truth. Therefore, seeking truth from facts pays the most attention to reason and the most attention to factual proof.</p>
<p>After clearly distinguishing right from wrong, one must judge right from wrong. There is no way to be neutral or reconcile between right and wrong. Therefore, the result of judgment is only one right and one wrong. The meaning of not being a mediator is to ask people to clearly state the true right and wrong. One must have the courage to not offend others, be unconcerned, and be unafraid of being corrupted by wealth, moved by poverty, or subdued by force. Mediators often obscure right and wrong intentionally or unintentionally in order to please others. Those who do not mediate believe that right and wrong are supreme, so in any environment, they are able to disregard everything and boldly judge.</p>
<p>Using reason to seek true right and wrong proven by facts, and clearly judging true right and wrong, is the most scientific modern spirit. This spirit is even more needed in China's current situation. The biggest problem of China's national society is, first, the lack of clarity in right and wrong, and second, that no one dares to speak out even when there is true right and wrong. The consequence of unclear right and wrong is to encourage people to do evil. Having true right and wrong but no one daring to speak out is the same as having no true right and wrong, resulting in the loss of people's courage to do good. How can such a society be stable or progress? We, who are engaged in the news industry, hear and see more than ordinary people, especially in recent years, seeing the atmosphere of unclear right and wrong throughout the country, leading to the unrest of the country and society, and even more causing harm to the future survival of the nation. For example, if there is no right and wrong in politics, corruption will run rampant, honest officials will be suppressed, or officials who are not competent will not be dismissed immediately, but will be transferred, forming a corrupt situation. If there is no right and wrong in society, speculation and profit-seeking will flock to it, and public welfare undertakings will hesitate to move forward, forming a situation where only profit matters. It is true that "what the heart thinks is dangerous, one must speak out." Therefore, we do not avoid taboos and repeatedly speak out directly, hoping to create a social atmosphere so that ordinary people can distinguish between right and wrong, and hoping that the whole country can "seek truth from facts and not be mediators."</p>
<h3>Arakan Mountain Battlefront: Japanese-Indian Forces Advance in the Rain, Imphal Plain Situation Critically Imminent</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th – The eastern Burma-India border war zone has entered the rainy season. On the 300-kilometer Arakan mountain area battlefield, torrential rains have been falling for days. The Japanese-Indian allied forces are braving the rain to fiercely attack enemy troops, and their courage is becoming more and more excited. The rainy season in Manipur is about a month earlier than Arakan and a month later than the Fougong valley. From the "Roof of the World" Himalayas, the northeast seasonal winds all head towards the low-pressure area in the west. Therefore, Assam experiences strong westerly winds starting in April, causing the sudden rains in the northeast. This kind of thunderstorm landscape often strikes the Arakan mountains. The average annual rainfall in Manipur is 60 hours, and the average annual rainfall in Shillong, 150 kilometers west of Imphal, is 520 hours, making it the rainiest place in the world. Therefore, this place is commonly known as the world of rain. In Imphal, it rains for about 10 days in mid-April, about 15 days in mid-May, and about 20 days in mid-June, with the number of rainy days gradually increasing. The Manipur basin is turning into a pond, and the temperature is also rising with the rainy season. The Japanese-Indian allied forces are launching an offensive to defeat the British and American forces and annihilate them in this natural environment.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th – A unit of the Japanese army advanced to the north of Imphal. After occupying the Mapa Highland, which is 15 kilometers from Imphal, its main force launched an attack on the enemy's fortified position on the Melbourne Highland, 5 kilometers southwest of Mapa. Because the Japanese army has completely occupied the highland, it can suppress Imphal from a commanding position.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Somewhere on the Burma Front, 11th – The decisive battle on the Imphal Plain is becoming increasingly imminent. To counter the pressure from the Japanese army in the northern mountainous area, the enemy forces have formed a final defensive line northeast of Palel, and continue to fight hard with the area around Palel as the focus of defense in the south. Palel is a key fortress in the southeast of the Imphal Plain, relying on the Logtak Lake wetland as a military stronghold. Therefore, the battle for Palel is actually the key to deciding the Imphal battle. After the Japanese army recaptured the Imphal fortress, they continued to advance and attack Kipgen, Haimol, Dimapur and other places, gradually approaching Palel. On the 6th, they engaged in fierce battles with the enemy forces defending Palel. The vanguard of the Japanese army has approached Palel 10 kilometers, and the sound of artillery fire from both armies is deafening. The enemy inside and outside Palel has concentrated the 20th Division, with a main force of about 12,000 people and artillery units, in Palel. Also, on the Palel airfield side, the enemy forces are attempting a final resistance. The Japanese army is increasing pressure on the highway between Kohima and Imphal, directly threatening Imphal. Also, advancing from the Mairambung Highland, 10 kilometers north, they reached the eastern highlands of the Imphal Plain, and launched a fierce mountain battle. Also, the Japanese army's northbound troops continue to occupy Jakaema and Damdim, and are now approaching the gateway to the Imphal Plain. The war on the Imphal Plain, which has an area of only 1,000 square kilometers, is now imminent.</p>
<h3>Assam-Bengal Railway Seriously Threatened</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Indian Front, 11th – After the Japanese-Indian allied forces captured Kohima, the Assam-Bengal Railway was seriously threatened. This railway is the connection between Assam and Bengal provinces and is a major artery in northeastern India. If the railway is cut off, Assam and Bengal provinces will be in a state of paralysis. The railway starts from Chittagong in Bengal Province, passes through the Khasi and Jaintia hills of Assam Province, and then goes northeast, passing through the southern part of the Brahmaputra basin, to Sadiya. The total length of the line is about 1,000 meters. Before and after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it actively transported troops and ammunition. In addition to the branch line from Badarpur to Silchar, there are several other branch lines connecting the main areas. The most important ones are the following three lines: one is the branch line from Lumding to Gauhati, which connects the Assam-Bengal Railway and the East Indian Bengal Railway, a major trunk line in the western region, connecting Bengal and Assam. One is the branch line from Tinsukia to Dibrugarh. Dibrugarh is located along the Brahmaputra River and is the seat of the county government. It is a key hub for water and land transportation, connecting the trunk line of the Assam-Bengal Railway via the Brahmaputra River. One is the branch line from Tinsukia to Ledo. This branch line was laid to develop the coal mines and oil fields in northern Assam. This area has always been a commercial center between Assam and Burma, and the commercial route between Assam and China also passes through this line.</p>

<p>Eastern Front War Situation</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th – Havas Agency reports that fierce battles are raging in the southern section of the Eastern Front in recent days. No special events have occurred in the middle and northern sections. Although the Soviet army has made repeated advances, the German army is still able to retreat according to plan, and its actions have not been hindered. There is also war in Crimea, where the Soviet army attacked the German positions in Perekop and on the Putrid Sea coast. After many struggles, it was only able to break through a gap in the Perekop area and is still fighting hard. The German army retreating from Odessa is acting calmly and unhurriedly. The Soviet army's advance is very slow. The German army in Tarnopol fought hard, but due to the disparity in numbers and the heavy artillery fire, they had to withdraw from the city.

<h3>Decisive Battle to Liberate India Unfolds on the Manipur Plain</h3>
<p>A powerful Japanese unit carrying the rear area supply lines of Imphal and Kohima successively approached the lines on the 29th, threatening the enemy's Fourth Army Corps and controlling Imphal from the rear, establishing a general offensive posture. On the night of the 28th, led by the vanguard that cut off the Kohima road in Mikhruma, powerful units of the Japanese army occupied a location 30 kilometers north of Imphal on the 29th. Furthermore, according to the enemy headquarters communique, Japanese army units have destroyed the bridges on the Imphal-Kohima road, and the enemy's rear supply lines have been completely trampled by various Japanese army units. The situation for the general attack on Imphal is nearing completion.</p>
<p>Battle Reaches Climax</p>
<p>The Japanese army, cooperating with the Indian National Army, has only entered the jungles of India for a dozen days, and the battle has already entered its climax. A major change in the war situation is about to occur, and a new battlefield will unfold on the land of India, which has been dominated by Britain for three hundred years. Due to meticulous and well-planned actions, the Japanese army's strategy has broken through the enemy's lines deployed on various fronts in Burma, and has now transformed into an offensive to liberate India. In this great battle on the Manipur Plain, there is the Japanese army advancing into India, the Indian National Army returning to their homeland, and on the other hand, the British Fourth Army Corps stubbornly defending the Manipur Plain, as well as Indian soldiers who are being forcibly killed by their compatriots at gunpoint. The depth and complexity of the situation is unparalleled on any front and is attracting worldwide attention.</p>
<p>India, which once shone brightly in the history of Eastern civilization but is now groaning under three centuries of British domination, is about to undergo a radical change with this battle as a turning point. The shaking and chaos of the enemy's lines is a sign of the arrival of this momentous day. The opposition and friction between the British and American commanders, Chongqing's disappointment and unease, and the anxiety of the British government and the Indian people about the future of India - these are the current situations wandering in the mire of opposition.</p>
<p>Enemy Strategy Fails</p>
<p>The split in the enemy's three headquarters: "Recapturing Burma" was the most important strategy of the enemy since the Quebec Conference. As Nimitz said, "To destroy Japan's production capacity, we must bomb the Japanese mainland." Therefore, no matter what, we must "ensure air bases along the South China coast," and the prerequisite is to recapture Burma. Since the appointment of Mountbatten, the plan agreed upon at the Cairo Conference was to concentrate large forces around Burma and use an outer-line encirclement attack to break through the Japanese defense on the inner line, reopen the Ledo Road, and complete the strategic trunk line linking India, Burma, and Chongqing. But everything is hopeless, and the situation has completely reversed. The forces of the various armies have been completely defeated by the elite Japanese forces in the last two months.</p>
<p>Not only that, after this month, it will be the six-month rainy season that everything cannot but be abandoned. The enemy's opposition and division erupted against this background. From the perspective of the US headquarters, Mountbatten is unreliable, and Chongqing is also criticizing the British army's poor performance. The three headquarters have lost the feeling of mutual trust, which is the culmination of the Japanese army's operation this time.</p>
<p>The meeting between Mountbatten and Stilwell (March 15) was an attempt to reach a temporary compromise. But four days after the meeting, the Japanese army entered India, and the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. The reality that the British army feared most finally arrived.</p>
<p>India's Fate: The enemy is also completely divided over the Japanese army's advance into India. Regarding the location of this great battle, Imphal, the American government is turning a blind eye and saying it is worthless. But that is obviously a show of strength. The US military cannot but know that the only supply route for the air force stationed in Chongqing is under serious threat. But the problem is the distrust of the Allied British army, and the British's annoyance is very profound. Auchinleck bluntly said, "The British army does not intend to abandon the Imphal Plain to the Japanese army. In fact, the situation is not that serious." But the opportunity for the great battle is fast approaching. But the surrender of Indian soldiers under British surveillance, the great turmoil in India, the Indian Central Legislative Assembly's rejection of the Indian government's tax increase proposal, and Governor-General Wavell's statement that "the Indian people are not engaged in the defense of India," but the Indian people have long seen through what the real strategy is for defending India.</p>
<p>The Trend of World Justice</p>
<p>In this situation, we cannot help but think of Prime Minister Tojo's historic speech on March 22: "The purpose of the Empire is to defeat the enemy forces and completely entrust India to the Indians. The land of the motherland India, which the National Army is attacking, will immediately be placed under the administration of the Provisional Government of Free India... The independence of India is the will of the entire Asia and the destination of world justice." The imminent general offensive on Imphal, the great battle on the Manipur Plain, contains various historical elements and is about to unfold. (Sho: From the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 3)</p>

<h3>Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing: Purchase Permits to Be Issued First, Sales to Commence on a Scheduled Date Once Issued</h3>
<p>Regarding the current progress of the temporary cotton cloth rationing in this city, the following was learned from the Business Control Committee: The "Purchase Permits" have been printed by the Business Control Committee and handed over to the Cloth Dealers' Guild for distribution to the designated merchant shops, which will affix secret code stamps and submit them to the committee. The Business Control Committee has already sent more than 3 million stamped "Purchase Permits" to the municipal government with a detailed list attached, awaiting notification from the municipal government regarding the total population of the city before making any additions or subtractions. These "Purchase Permits" will be distributed to citizens by the municipal government through various districts, which will take some time. It is now decided to distribute the "Purchase Permits" first, and sales will commence on a scheduled date once they are issued. The types of cloth to be sold to the designated merchant shops will be determined by the Executive Yuan. Sales will first be made from the approved retained quantity of each merchant shop, followed by the allocation of loose cloth. The Cloth Dealers' Guild is currently dispatching personnel to each designated merchant to investigate and compile a list of various types of cloth within their retained quantity, calculating the dimensions and prices, in order to prevent irregularities and ensure order.</p>
<p>Correction to Detailed Rules for Purchasing Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>In the book "Regulations on Material Control," published last month by the Materials Control Deliberation Committee, on page 44, under the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton, in Article 13, Section 2, there was originally no statement that cotton cloth of 5 packages or less per household would not be temporarily purchased. To avoid misunderstandings, the Business Control Committee specially telegraphed the Materials Control Deliberation Committee to promptly investigate the case and announce a correction. It is now learned that the Materials Control Deliberation Committee has replied that it has complied and announced the correction.</p>
<h3>Old Zhabei Branch Detects Fraudulent Impersonation of Military Personnel; Hopes Citizens Will Behave Themselves</h3>
<p>Recently, some petty criminals in this city have been impersonating military personnel, falsely claiming to be from the "5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army," forging a large number of commission certificates, insignias, military and civilian official certificates, etc., openly selling them, and engaging in deception within the concession, causing disturbances to public order and serious harm. After receiving a secret report, the First Police Bureau ordered all branches to conduct a strict investigation. The Old Zhabei Branch has successively solved two cases within a few days. The details of the fraud are recorded below:</p>
<p>Details of the Investigation</p>
<p>Hong Hanbin, the director of the Old Zhabei Branch, received a secret report on the 5th of this month that someone was impersonating military personnel in room 402 of the Nanjing Hotel, flaunting weapons, and selling forged commission certificates, etc. He immediately ordered Liu Junjie, the director of the judicial section, to dispatch detectives to the aforementioned location. They arrested six people, including Lin Zhongmin, who falsely claimed to be the "Commander of the 13th Division of the 5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army," and Liu Pengju, who falsely claimed to be the "Chief of Staff," and confiscated two Browning pistols, two Mauser pistols (both without licenses), as well as a large number of forged commission certificates, insignias, official certificates, cards, and other items. They were taken to the bureau and interrogated. The six criminals confessed to the aforementioned matters. They also confessed that the so-called "5th Army of the Chinese Autonomous Army" was led by Jing Zhong as "Army Commander" and Wang Datong as "Commander-in-Chief," who specialized in deception and defrauding the ignorant. The bureau detained them and continued the investigation. On the previous day (10th), based on reports from informants, more than ten people, including Qiu Hongjun, who falsely claimed to be the "Commander of the 1st Division of the Sino-Russian Autonomous 5th Army," were arrested in rooms 525 of the Oriental Hotel and rooms 203 and 22 of the Jue Lu Hotel. At the same time, a large number of forged seals, commission certificates, and war official certificates were confiscated in the rooms. After strict interrogation, they also confessed to the aforementioned matters. However, they did not know the criminals arrested in the previous case. The bureau believes that there must be other accomplices lurking within the concession, so they are continuing the investigation. Once the investigation is completed, they will be handed over to the relevant authorities for strict punishment according to the law.</p>
<p>The police authorities are very concerned about this type of case and hope that citizens will behave themselves and not have unrealistic ideas. At the same time, if any of the above-mentioned situations are discovered, they should report to the police station for arrest and prosecution in order to maintain local security.</p>

<p>Regarding the hoarding of essential goods related to people's livelihoods, such as matches, soap, and candles, the Materials Investigation Committee has prepared a table and instructed the respective trade associations to distribute it to their member merchants and factories to report their inventory and production status. After the reporting period expires, the committee will review the results. Although the reports have been enthusiastic, it is inevitable that some will conceal information or provide false reports. Therefore, the committee convened a full committee meeting and began implementing the investigation a few days ago. It is learned that the committee will divide all investigators into ten groups to investigate the three materials of matches, soap, and candles, assigning them to conduct thorough investigations in designated areas. If it is found that there are false declarations or failures to declare, they will be severely punished according to the law, and the hoarded goods will be confiscated and forfeited to the government.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to Review Status of Increase in Capital of Financial Firms</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen financial institutions in various regions, the Ministry of Finance issued a notice last year to all banks and financial firms that if their capital was insufficient, they should promptly increase their discount rate, which was to end by the end of March of this year. It is learned that since the ministry issued the notice, financial firms in various regions have been ordered to implement it and have successively submitted it to the ministry for review. The financial firms in various regions have now completed the procedures, and the ministry will begin the review. It is also heard that the results of this capital increase are quite good, with most financial firms having completed the capital increase. A small number of them have slight problems, and the ministry plans to adopt reasonable measures to thoroughly adjust them. It is currently actively preparing a concrete plan, which will be announced and implemented once it is fully researched.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau Proclamation</h3>
<p>Upon investigation, various municipal taxes should be reported and paid by taxpayers themselves according to regulations. In the past, due to environmental constraints, personnel were dispatched to collect them. Now that municipal administration has entered a normal track, thorough rectification should be carried out to emphasize tax administration. It is hereby decided that starting from the summer of the 33rd year (1944), all merchants in the city should pay various taxes and levies to the tax collection office in their respective districts, following the verified amount payable, and report and pay within the deadline. No additional staff will be dispatched to collect taxes outside to prevent malfeasance. In addition to issuing separate orders and dispatching personnel to review at any time, this announcement is issued for the information of all merchants, who should understand the personal interests involved and truthfully report and pay on time, without colluding to underreport or delay, which would result in penalties. This is a crucial matter. This proclamation.</p>
<p>April 6, 33rd year of the Republic of China (1944)</p>
<p>Director Yuan Houzhi</p>
