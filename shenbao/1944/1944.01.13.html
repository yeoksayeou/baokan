<p>社評</p>
<h3>向米統會當局再進一言</h3>
<p>據本月七日報載米統會袁主任表示，甲乙兩區採辦成續，甚爲良好，裁至十二月底止巳經採辦三百十萬石，第一批三十餘萬石業巳到滬，足敷上海全市民一月有餘之用，充作農歷正月特別配給。本市戶口米之配給，迭經研討結果，巳决定由上海糧食調整委員會，於三十三年一月十一日恢復爲每月三期，每期二升。此點實現後，黑市米需要，自然减少，供求旣日趨平衡，米價自當回落，市民生活前途，當可漸趨安定。</p>
<p>本市一八兩區，昨日發售第五十九期戶口米，增至兩升。在過去四個月中，戶口米每期祗配給一升，此次增至兩升，兩相比較，差强人意。也是米統會當局表示的第一步證實。</p>
<p>然而，事實上黑市米價跳躍不巳，威脅未减，老實說，我們市民在未得足量配給米之前，在黑市米價威脅未澈底消滅之前，對於常局的樂觀表示與局部的調整，絕不能滿足。同時，我們認爲當局如果具備决心，眞的爲民食問題盡瘁心力，勇毅果决以赴，那末，滿足市民的要求，絕非不可能之事，而且是絕有把握之事。試舉一例，就可以充分證明了。</p>
<p>上面所記的袁主任表示，米統會在甲乙兩區已經採辦三百十萬石，而運滬的有三十餘萬石，足敷上海市民一月有餘之用，依此推算，則米統會四月餘來所採辦的米，已夠上海市民一年之用，那末，滿足市民要求，豈非絕有把握的事呢？不過，據我們估計，每人每月需要米糧平均爲一斗五升，就以市民四百萬計算，每月需米六十萬石，雖與當局估計相差半數，然以米統會採辦數量而觀，則四個月中採辦之米，可供市民五個月以上之用，也並非不可能之事。</p>
<p>根據上面估計，可以肯定的說，米統會祇須辦理得當，很可能配給足量，滿足市民需要，澈底消滅黑市。然則，怎樣可以辦理得當呢？我們過去已再四獻言，現在更不　煩瑣，再爲當局一陳之：</p>
<p>第一，甄別優劣，嚴懲舞弊。米統會是新機構，是關係大衆福利的機構，絕對應弊絕風淸，以新人民耳目。而事屬統制，舞弊之「利益」極大，最易使不良份子動心舞弊。因此，我們會竭力主張米統會當局應愼重用人，如果發現作弊，尤須不徇私情，依法懲辦，使人民信仰，同時取得盟邦更熱烈的協助。可是我們聽到該會某職員弊有據，物議譁然，雖向法院吿發，而人犯先已逃避，這是絕不澈底的，使米統會整個信譽受損。而同時商統會也有職員舞弊，聞迄今仍在扣押審訊，同樣是統制新機構，同樣是屬員舞弊，而懲辦不同，這是米統會當局應加反省而重視的。</p>
<p>第二，調整人事，更新改組。米統會雖僅成立數月的新機構，而人事複雜，派別很多，動輒牽制，遇事把住，不難想見，如此人事，欲共辦理得當，自屬南轅北轍。我們認爲當局應痛下决心澈底改組，刈除派別，以用人唯才，適人適事爲標準，非如此，决難負起重大使命，而一切談話表示，將成不能兌現的空頭支票而已。</p>
<p>第三，職權應一元化。米統會職掌原是採辦儲運配給三項，事實上非有此職掌也不易發揮職能。可是，現在米統會僅管採辦一項，而儲運與配給均非所管，我們認爲米統會旣設在上海，則本市配給一事，至少應由該會直接辦理，以專責成，使無藉口推諉。所以，我們主張米糧調整委員會應合併於米統會，至少負起採辦與配給責任，職權一元化。同時，强化米統會組織，使能充分勝任。</p>
<p>我們認爲上面三點，是米統會克盡責任的對症藥物，與其多開室頭支票，徒矢信用，不如切切實實，把握要點實施。市民的呼聲是最公道的批評，在則是，非則非，決不會指鹿爲馬的。同時，我們始終認定，戶口米配給足量，則黑市米自然消滅，不滅自滅；在戶口米配給未能足量之前，如欲强制收買黑市米，以圖消滅，則黑市米決不會絕跡，而徒然造成黑市愈高。因爲配給不足，其不足之數取之黑市，如無黑市，難道餓死不成，旣稱黑市，原非公開，於是表面禁止黑市，表面黑市雖因之滅少，但夾層份子適以利用特殊便利，暗中摸案，於是黑市更高，市民不甘餓死，忍痛求之，此其害民，實猶過之。所以，我們一貫主張，「取締走私，代以公運；消滅黑市，代以官價」，黑市固須消滅，但必須代以官價的戶口米，絕不是只予消滅黑市，而不予足量配給。足量配給是「本」。消滅黑市是「末」，「捨本「而只知「逐末「，自非妥全之道，我們不辭反覆論列，願米統會當局與關係方面三致意之。</p>
<h3>新不列顛島激戰日守軍奮勇卻敵　特羅基納方面敵渡河未逞</h3>
<p>東京十二日由央社電　據南太平洋某地電：新不列顛島之登陸戰鬥，日益傚烈，敵軍企圖在飛機大砲掩護之下，逞其　心，但其企圖連日已被日軍粉碎，且受創甚重。波根灣瓦爾晚方面敵軍，在飛機大砲掩護之下，一再進攻，日軍即極力痛擊，阻其前進，但至十日下午，敵軍進抵三角山以南一公里之地點，兩軍前機僅隔百米，刻正在對峙中。綜計自丸日起至十日止，敵軍損失遣屍四十一具，傷約二百人，日方幾無損失，至馬加斯角方面之戰况，日軍于奪回阿羅埃機塲後，繼續向東挺進。六日察知敵軍企圖進攻，乃先發制人，發動攻擊，粉碎其企圖，是役敵軍遺屍三十具，日軍截獲輕機槍四挺，自動步槍及步槍子彈甚夥。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電：波根維爾島特屬基納方面敵軍釣入子人，入日夜會潛入薩瓦河渡河點北方某地，日軍發覺後立予迎擎，激戰約一小時許，敵卒潰退。是役敵軍棄屍三具，日軍並鹵獲自動步槍三挺及彈藥二〇五〇發，日方無損失。</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地訊：馬紹爾羣島方面；最近敵機會屢次來襲，九日下午有敵北美Ｂ二五型機約十數架，於潄柴烏作低空掃射，日海軍守備隊奮勇迎擊，當將其擊退。十一日復有機型不明之敵機十一架，空襲達拉瓦島，亦被日海軍守備隊熾烈高射砲火擊退，但日方無損害。</p>
<h3>南部印緬邊境　日軍戒備嚴　敵圖進攻孟多被擊退</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　緬甸前綫日軍某基地電，印。緬邊境敵軍，近逐次增强孟多方面兵力，圖於印緬國境發動，以期奪回孟多，然均被守備該地之日軍擊退。目前以孟多爲中心之南部印緬國境之戒備，異常嚴密、致使敵人難得乘隙。八日夜，敵軍百五十人，企圖潛入孟多北方某地，經日軍發覺後，立予擊退。又九日上午敵軍曾進擊孟多東部地區，日軍常由北西兩方予以圍剿，日軍於十日晨開始積極攻擊塔那河套之敵軍，目前仍在繼續中。</p>
<p>日空軍戰果</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據日車某基地電，印。緬邊境敵空軍攻勢日爲激烈，且對緬甸各地時加空襲，日軍航空部隊對此頑敵則　加痛擊，予以重創，樹心赫赫戰果，日空軍卓越戰技，巳使敵人爲之震服矣。據日大本營本月四日之發表，綜合去歲十二月間緬甸方面日空軍戰果實極偉大，就各現地爭當局所判明及日大本營所發表者，總計　落擊毀敵機共一百二十三架外，若加其爆炸發火者富達一百五十二架之數。又同月中該方面予敵船舶倉庫等設施之損失，亦己判明日空軍戰門力之如何偉大，茲將該綜合戰果之詳情錄後：擊落敵機一百零四架，擊毀三十五架，炸毀敵機停放地上者十二架，合計一百五十二架（按日大本營發表擊落為一百零四架，擊毀十九架，合計一百二十三架），日機於此期間之損失，有自炸未　還及受重創者共二十二架（按日大本營發表爲二十四架）。又日機於各次進攻作戰中，曾繫沉敵五千順船舶五艘，中型船二艘，六千噸或七千噸船舶六艘。合計十三艘，外炸毀其倉庫碼頭等十二處，使之發生大火，破壞其鐵道設施等十二處，並炸毀其車輛及軍需儲藏地等甚夥於十一日下午五時半飛抵馬尼刺，是時村田大使及日菲各要人均到塲歡迎，大使當日即下機馬尼刺飯店並與村田大使懇談甚久十二日商務十時赴菲總統官　諧洛勒爾總統，敘談多時始辭出，旋歷訪勒庫特外長及日陸，海軍最高指揮官等。</p>
<h3>芳澤大使　飛抵馬尼刺　即將返日一行</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十二日中央社電　日駐越南大使芳澤，爲與本國政府接洽要務，特作返國之行，歸途中</p>
<h3>美驅逐艦　一艘被襲擊</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　據南太平洋日軍某基地電，美巡洋艦及驅逐鐵所組成之艦隊。會於八日夜炮　聖德蘭島南方之波泡蘭島，日海軍當即應戰，故展開熾烈砲擊戰，結果擊破美軍驅逐艦一艘，並使其兩艘遭受重創而逃，日方損害極輕。</p>
<h3>渝民衆對美空軍　抱不協力態度　妨礙反軸心軍對日作戰</h3>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　據桂林傳來消息，美空軍補充部桂林支部美人代表，頃對大公報記者，申訴渝方民衆不協力美空軍之態度，藉促渝方民衆之反省云。觀此可知渝方民衆對美駐渝空軍之反感如何深厚，極堪注目也。據該美人談稱：反軌心軍之對日攻勢，係從渝方領土開始，此爲公認之意見。我人爲實現此方策，已繼續努力，以迄於今。但仍未能具體實現者，蓋由於渝方民眾抱不協力態度所致也。美渝混合空軍編成以來，渝方官　對於美空軍之態度，雖有若千改善，但尚未徹底。一般民衆更無協力之意，尤使我人苦痛者，　為每人將士之日用生活產品極難獲得。於是渝方商人以奇貨可居，肆意提高外人日用生活物品之價格，以資牟利。美空軍將士已成爲若輩之榨取對象。故美空軍將土日用所需，不得不仰賴由印度方面接濟，然此事極妨礙軍需品等之運輸。如軍需品與軍械，不能大量圓滑運輸，則反軸心軍由渝方土地發動對日反攻作戰，實無法實現，假如渝方民衆希望對日反攻，則應內心協力美軍。</p>
<h3>法規編委會　重要決議案</h3>
<p>南京十二日中央社電　司法行政部法規編修委員會，日昨召開第三次會議，由胡澤吾主席，其重要决議案，爲修正法律通過條例草案之通過，該項條例關係國際私法，迭經該會審愼研究，詳加修訂，茲已將草案加以整理通過，呈部核示。又關於管轄在華外人訴訟條例，及外籍律師執行職務章程，亦爲收回法權後司法上應用之重耍條規，原草案經指定該會劉委員志敭，錢參議森審查，茲據繕具意見書，提經此次會議，推定黃委員慶中，康委員煥棟，林參議文海，再行一審查。</p>
<h3>美轟炸機數架　前夜襲台灣　在高雄鹽水附近投彈</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電　台北電話，台灣日軍於十二日下午發表：敵轟炸機數架，於十一日下午十時左右，越過日軍驚戒網，飛往台灣高雄及　水（台南北方三十公里）附近投彈轟炸，即刻倉　遁去。日方損失僅死者一人，負傷者十五人而已，此次來襲之敵機似係由渝方基地飛來之　機，蓋美駐渝空軍之使命，顯已由轟炸日軍在中國佔　地，而窺伺空製日本土之機會，但日軍在中國及日本內地本土之空防極嚴。不克達成其野心，乃企圖　近距離之台灣施行游擊戰的轟炸，藉以對國內外誇大宣傳其　量。憶去年十一月二十五日，美機約二十架來襲台灣新野，曾被日軍擊落三架，此次再度來襲，係於深夜，故地上受損極輕微。</p>

<h3>日八十四屆議會下周內繼續舉行　政府所提法案已全部決定</h3>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日本第八十四次議會，將於二十一日繼續舉行。按日本自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，已舉行通常議會二次，臨時議會四次，各議會之召開，均爲順應當前之戰局，且具收有甚大之效果，此次議會，乃以重大之戰同爲背量，故對增張生產及强力推進諸施策上，必獲顯著之成果，實頗値期待。過去幾次議會，由於議會當局之積極協力，每次議會均能達其目的，茲日東條首相及日政府當局之發言，抑及議會之議論，已引起內外之注目，所以當議會再開時，日首相之施策演說，與政府各官長關於目前戰局之報吿，以曁反映國民完遂戰爭熱意之議會方面之質問議論等，尤爲最可期待者。日政府與議會業經一體化。故議會必能順應政府之方針，而發揮戰時議會之本質，今因政府提案之迅速與預算案之早期决定，其審議之進展，當較前次議會尤速，而於最短期內審議完畢，是乃貴衆兩院均可在本月中急速從事審議。日本此次議會之法律案件，較前次議會已減半，其中應注目者，爲增稅案等數件，是故議會之議論，不以法案爲主，而著力於法案背後之基本問題，特別關於本年重要政治課題之糧食問題，國民動員，增强運輸力等，將可有寶貴之意見產生。又關於此種問題，政府表示如何方針，尤堪注目，增產飛機，乃爲日本目前最重要者，且此亦己漸上軌道，然爲推進增產飛機於勞務食糧及運輸各方面，須講求具體措置。關於此點，在議會再開時，將執烈加以檢討者，翼贊會八日舉行全體會議，整備議會再開時之準備事宜，政府方面，在十一日前已將法案全部决定預算案，亦僅餘追加預算，故預定亦可於十四日前完全决定，各方面對於議會之準備均巳趨元畢，而政府與蠶贊會之一體化更趨緊密，因兩者之連絡極為圓滑，是以議會再開時，當可充分發揮决勝議會之意議也。</p>

<h3>薩爾尼爭奪戰激烈進行中　貝蔡科普地戰事復起</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　據海通社訊：蘇軍在冬季攻勢若干重心之壓力，於週一略予減輕，然此僅屬暫時性質，因蘇軍於繼續發動猛攻以前，略予部署於補充。雜特勃斯克西北。西南·與南部之局勢，仍無改變。敵軍在勒契薩迤西至進攻已遭遏　，德軍在該區之陣線，尚未受嚴重之威脅。舊波蘭國境西方之薩爾尼攻防戰，十日突吿展開，刻仍在激鬥中，蘇軍右翼擬自西南方轉進，然亦被德軍所阻，現尙未能與貝迪契夫西方戰鬥合流，柯內夫麾下之蘇軍左翼對尼普貝特羅夫斯克西南至克里伏洛格問之德軍陣地開始大規模之攻勞，然該方而蘇軍所收之成果尙不足重視。又貝萊枓普地峽之攻勢再度展開，是否爲蘇軍總攻克里米亞半島之序幕，尙一不明瞭。</p>

<p>里斯本十二日中央社電據華盛頓息：羅斯福總統昨致議會之開幕咨文，要求議會予以實施强迫勞役之全權。渠解釋其動機稱，人民之總動員爲最後勝利之先决條件。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電羅斯福致國會咨文於强制勞役建議之後，繼以五項立法程序，包括　際的徵稅率，　軍火合同協商之繼績，　食糧價格，　提早重行實施穩定經濟法條，○國民勞役律，羅氏謂其外交政策之大目標爲「安全」，渠稱：「吾於抱疑慮之感者進一言，彼等慮及赫爾君及余對將來措施有所約定，致吾國爲秘密條約所束縛或扮演「聖誔老人」之角色，（意即為人作嫁）吾意所欲云者，即邱吉爾斯達林及蔣介石應均對吾憲法之限定透徹理解，赫爾及余亦然，誠然吾人所約定，吾人確曾約定一極龐天而十分明確之軍事計觀，此計劃需用全部友邦之軍力，於最早之可能時間內達到擊敗敵國之目的，但無秘密條約以及政治上或財政上之約定，吾人所曾討論之最高未來目標，不問爲各國自身或爲各國策體計，可以一言敞之之曰」安全」</p>
<h3>美機大舉襲德擊落逾百架足證德國空防鞏固</h3>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電德元首行營議表特別公報稱：美轟炸機隊十一日最曾來襲德國中部，但於德軍堅固之防禦下，未克收獲何等戰果。據截至今日之報吿，是役德戰鬥機隊及高射砲隊共擊落多爲四引擎之美轟炸機一百三十三架，但據後獲詳訊，判明擊落機數包括重轟炸機百二十四架，總數爲百三十六架。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電德國新聞社訊：美機於星期二日空襲德國中部領土，當被擊落不下七十八架，其中大半爲四引擎轟炸機。此次美轟炸機空襲德國領土，並無戰鬥機爲之保護，此種企圖自一九四三年十月以來尙屬第一次，結果敵損失重大。組織完善之德國防禦，終於阻遏敵集中之襲擊，故德國之勝利尤爲重要。</p>
<h3>義境美軍繼續攻勢　卡西諾爲目標</h3>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　綜合南義戰線前線消息：美第五軍為藉德軍自聖維多爾撤退之機會，期一舉攻略卡西諾起見，刻仍繼續出動後繼部隊北進，目下擬正以卡西諾南四公里之柴爾哇爲中心展激戰。然德軍於卡西諾四周，已整備鐵桶般之防禦反軸心軍今後攻擊該市，人力物力復將　重大損害。頃據合衆社阿爾及爾電，美軍十一日雖已進達能以遙望卡西諾市之某地點，然於到達該市前，仍一須突破多數之德軍要塞。反軸心空軍最近復壓轟炸義半島各地，十一日計曾　炸安科納，波拉，聖具內迭特等地。</p>

<p>奧斯陸十二日中央社電德國駐挪威專員德波達徇挪威首相葵士林之提議，於新年內下令釋放大批政治犯。</p>
<h3>義政變案大審紀詳　齊亞諾等已槍決</h3>
<p>維羅那十二日中央社電海通社訊：此問昨午宣稱：齊亞諾波諾上將及巴勒希戈達狄。馬里奈利等諸人。經判處死刑後，已於十一日上午九時執行。罪狀為賣國通敵，藉和平之名出賣法西斯主義，破壤國家之抵抗力及軍事行動。其中薛奈蒂雖經判處死刑，因案情較輕，故獲改處三十年有期徒刑，其餘十八人則均處以極刑。</p>
<p>此次大審係於本月八日開始，至十日後二時宣吿結束，開庭時首先審問</p>
<p>波諾上將波諾辯曰，去年七月甘四日法西斯黨召開最高會議時，格蘭第會詳言七計劃，及急需靈設憲法之要求，當時義相墨索里尼會稱，倘國王親自統率軍隊，則將被迫採取激烈措施，波諾繼否認已與王室有任何接觸。次審巴勒希</p>
<p>巴勒希　　巴勒希辯曰，義相所述各軍將領之消極情形，幷不使吾驚奇，蓋今之農業部內，亦有此種消極情形，　索里尼當時幷謂格蘭第之議程，在此軍事困難時期，頗不合時宜。繼審</p>
<p>薛奈蒂薛奈蒂除</p>
<p>叙述其照料工人及在阿爾巴尼亞作戰所得之經騐外，幷申述彼在軍中覺察參謀官員及其他高級軍官之賣國經過情形，當時余讀格蘭第决議之第一段，力言法西斯黨有採取保衛國家行動之必要後，巳極感　，未及再讀其下文，倘余能疑及格蘭第係一賣國賊，則余决不簽字其上。審及</p>
<p>戈達狄其答辯則謂，余之簽字在該决議案上，乃圖減輕墨索里尼所負軍事重任。馬里奈里之答辯亦與戈達狄相同。</p>
<p>齊亞諾所作之答</p>
<p>辯則謂，向最高會議所提出之决議案，乃與在最高會議開會前送至余處之决議原文不同，余復在法西斯職團會議中遇見格蘭第時，曾承其出示修改後之决議案，至余未將此一新發展吿知墨索里尼，則因自辭去外長後，與岳父極少接觸故也。　亞諸繼即稱推翻墨索里尼，終為吾人本身之破減，故打倒噩索里尼並不合理，然余認爲格關第之决議案，不外欲藉此使全國團結一致，故余乃在格氏之决議案上簽字，余之此舉優有錯誤，但决非叛變行爲。在被等之供詞中，其最要者二日裁判長朗讀</p>
<p>加維樂元帥之備</p>
<p>忘錄，該備忘錄詳述元帥關於去年七月廿五日發生政變之自身立塲，爲此次判决中之極重要文書，加維樂元帥係於去年九月中以來，早蓄伺機推翻墨索里尼元帥之决心，當反軸心軍在西西里島登陸以來，加維樂元帥之計劃益趨具體化，渠曾開始向義政府當局及貴院議員等進言，繼會晤巴特里奧元部及阿雨貝爾提上將，均一致同意在法西斯大評議會中，採用立憲之方法，期達成推翻墨索里尼之目的</p>
<p>裁判長繼就背叛份子之陰謀論述如次：查此次叛變事件，係法西斯黨員之政治陰謀，及加維樂元帥與巴特里奧等匯瓦伊亞家相合作，再加以軍人之陰謀等造成之。若輩計劃以立憲方法達到其目的，但因戰局日趨嚴重，墨索里尼氏決總動員法西斯黨員，以喚起國民之戰意，乃招集黨領袖往羅馬舉行大評議會，此次大評議會雖已明瞭選擇决議案之必然的結果，但克朗琪等已將推翻法西斯黨制之一切法律與政治權力供與國王矣。由是觀之，被吿之叛逆行為已昭然若揭，故依據國法宣告其死刑。繼又各被告辯護人開始辯論。經四小時之協議後，結果宣吿齊亞諾等五名處以死刑。</p>
<h3>漢口來鴻　駐渝美機濫炸商輸</h3>
<p>數千搭客淹斃江底失散屍首亟待打撈</p>
<p>駐渝美國飛機，迭次不顧人道，濫施轟炸，無辜平民，均遭犧牲。而最近馬當口發生的一幕空前慘劇，尤其令人切齒痛恨，茲記詳情如下：</p>
<p>上月二十八日，有屏山擴陽兩江輸，於商務十一時由九江離岸下駛。待行至馬當口，將近十二時，發現渝方飛機三架，翱翔天空。一見兩輪，即擲炸彈。屏山輪當中燒夷彈，一時火光中天，全船盡付焚如。幸該船駛至江岸旅客，大半脫險，惟雲陽綸中彈後，不久即側沉江心，所有艙內千餘乘客，爭先恐後，臨難擁擠，無法逃出艙面。因爲該船兩邊全是鐵板，祇有二三出口之處，船身側傾下沉，勢必人上壓人，所有屍首，萬難一時　出。照中國舊例，凡落水死者，天冷時七日浮起，天熱時三日浮起，若震陽船這種現象，非設法打撈屍首，終不能出現。日深月久，誠恐腐爛。彼等尙有乘客約八九十人，全集艙面未浸水之處，待至下午六時，始獲救援，返還九江。當由中日軍警及駐九江世界紅卍字會分會竭力安慰，除贈送優首熱茶衣物外，每人分送川資儲幣二百元，並由日憲兵隊簽發通行證。分發回籍。</p>
<p>屍者無者</p>
<p>渝方飛機藉美人殘忍手段，轟炸無辜民眾，死亡達數千人，這種暴行，令人痛恨，難民中有全家大小同罹於難者，試想人生世上，誰無父母，誰無兄弟，誰無妻兒，誰無親友，聞此惡耗，悲傷何似？兼之屍首無着，抱恨終天。幸而時屆嚴冬，一時不易腐化，若能設法打撈，屍屬亦可認領，惟茲事大，非各地各界人士羣起援助，不能成此偉大善舉。</p>
<p>如何善後</p>
<p>筆者希望上海個同鄉會各慈善團體各大善士，秉人類互助精神，主義空前慘劇，迅速組織善後委員會，辦理屍屬登記事宜，提前設法打撈屍首，俾屍親種種便利，前往出事地點認領，以免日久腐爛。聞世界紅卍字會對於此類工作，素所擅長，倘能由該會出而主持，必定有很好的成續，而使被難者的家屬，得到一些慰籍，實在是功德無量呢。（雲岑一月五日寄）</p>

<h3>出淵報道部長談最近戰況　爭取最後五分鐘勝利</h3>
<p>中央社訊昨（十二）日下午三時，日本陸軍報道部會見中國記者團例會席上，出淵報道部長對最近戰况發表談話如次：</p>
<p>値大東亞戰爭，進方以値生死關頭，極力準備反攻，日本方面亦予同樣之準備，並聯合大東亞各民族。準備決戰於此大戰中，東亞各民族每一個人抱有完成戰爭之决心，在過去一年中，美國爲掩飾初期作戰之敗績起見，一方面大事宣傳挽回民心，一方面更以種種企圖，欲恢復失地，但由於日本部隊之英勇及準備之充分，致迄於今日未能得逞，茲就敵美最近戰况詳述之：</p>
<p>敵美反攻進展受阻</p>
<p>敵美於北太平洋，南太平洋，及最近在中部太平洋等各方發動反攻，同時　便重慶，企圖以西方大陸爲根據，攻擊日本本土，一直到目前，此項企圖尚未消失，北方阿留申島，及蘇羅門島等可說是日本外國的防綫，由於日本之出血作戰，故敵英始終未得獲逞，但是他們憑着數量上的優勢，時想刺激僥倖的反攻，以實現其得一島進一島的戰略，但每一次都反中了日本的戰略，波跟維爾，吉爾巴特，　歇爾等處的海空戰，及新不列願，瑪加斯，格魯士他等地的登陸戰，都使他們在未登陸之前，巳傷失十餘萬之兵力，再講到新　內亞，芬希哈罕，吉爾巴特，塔拉哇，瑪金。，波根維爾，新不列顛等處，敵方登陸部隊經日軍猛力攻擊後，犧牲極爲重大。其軍事進展因而受阻，至今猶於兩方酣戰之中。</p>
<p>日軍始終浴血前進</p>
<p>再據路透社雪黎八日電中云：「日軍步兵部隊已攀登新不列顛之標的，於淸晨開始突擎，作戰之英勇，殊出意料，日軍部隊不顧一切損害，始終勇往直前，深入美軍陳地，作壯烈之肉搏。並在格魯斯他山峽，日軍從叢林之堡壘陣地發出强烈砲火，現時尚在激烈作戰中」云云，由此可證日軍始終浴血前進，作戰淒涼杜絕的情形，但是吾們不得不顧到敵方的反攻，因爲値茲生死關頭，敵方為避免慘敗起見，其反攻勢力之猛，自可預想，其次因爲敵軍作戰距離日本戰綫太近，故其所受之打擊亦大。</p>
<p>在過去一年中，美機受日軍炸毀者數達三百九十架以上，無論在前方或後方之機場，及其他設施。亦均遭日軍摧毀，還有一點，英美渝始終站在各自立塲，都希望發動奪取緬甸的戰事。在去年雨季過後即大事宣傳反攻，但在反攻尙未發動，於同年十月間重慶在怒江一役，全部崩潰，同時在另一方面，重慶利用蒙特巴登就任東南亞洲司令官的機會時發動戰爭，重慶雖有此心，然結果反被英美欺騙，站在前端作英美之犧牲。</p>
<p>還有敵美對援助在渝美空軍之努力，冒蓿日軍的攻擎，與氣候之困難來接濟，美室軍曾以一七〇〇〇英尺高度之飛行，越過希馬拉雅高峯，可見其不惜犧牲，爲接濟在渝美空軍之情況，彼等所以如此者，乃由於日軍之阻力所致，然吾人雖絕對信賴日空軍的堅强，但爲求澈底推毀美空軍之侵襲起見，當地各部隊仍努力設法遏止美空軍之活動。</p>
<p>戰爭已入第三階段</p>
<p>至於此次戰爭，到底是長期還長於短期內可望結束，這在任何人不能預言，但吾們總希望能速戰速决，於速戰速决的條件下。吾們不得不抱着長期作戰的决心。</p>
<p>吾人根機過去戰史來推測此次戰爭之結果，可分爲三個階段，第一個階段，在最初各小國因受大國之壓迫，致使國家生存受到威脅，於此情形之下，一定對大國反抗，爲求保全其國土及資源而作戰，但是小國無一舉而滅大國之力，其攻擊力必達於某一限度而止，同時力求增加其戰力，大國方面亦於此時從事增强戰力，雙方展開積極增加戰力的鬥爭，際此時期，大國一定趁小國無戰力進展時，給予重大打擊，在小國方面對內欲從事增加充實戰力，對外須防止大國得攻擊，此時最困難。即為第為二個階段，大國攻擊力到一定限度必不能繼續其對小國之壓力，而逐慚衰弱，在小國方面，已脫離危境，而內部戰力儲備充寶，與大國相等，然爲着完遂戰爭起見，還須賡續作戰，唯有此時雙方戰爭最苦，在國民之中，不免有所倦善意，祗要國內團結致，忍受苦難，勇敢奮鬥，到最後五分鐘，這樣才能獲得勝利的榮冠。</p>
<p>現在大東亞戰爭於第三階段，唯有今年是第三階段，故只有爭取這最後五分鐘，才能獲得最後勝利。</p>

<p>昨日發報時問七點十分</p>
<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>中儲券的新地位</h3>
<p>一個國家的通貨，必須備具兩個性能，一是通貨的法定性，一是通貨的流通性，有法定的通貨，而無暢達的流通，則其價値仍不免爲人所詬病。以中儲券的地位而言，自從去年四月一日盟拜日本當局停止發行軍票新鈔而後，中儲券巳成爲華中華南的唯一法定通貨，所以，由軍票儲券並用時代，以達中儲券一色化時代，便巳奠定中儲券在國內所應有的通貨地位了。</p>
<p>如今，由於中央儲備銀行與橫濱正金銀行簽訂通匯協定，實施集中華中華南與南方各國如越南，泰國，菲律賓等地域之匯兌，遂使中儲券並具國際貿易通貨之機能。主觀地講來，這樣一個措施的價値，可以語於中儲券本身地位之提高，與發行中儲券的中儲銀行所負使命之益臻重大；可是，客觀地講來，其價値之决定指標，則在於　在內爲國內物價之高低，　在外爲國際匯兌率之漲落，而二者又常互爲因果，即國內物價之騰跌，常足以引起外匯率之漲落，而外匯率之漲落，亦常足以引起國內物價之騰跌。今次通匯協定旣規定中備券爲華中華南對南方地域之唯一貿易通貨，而且其匯兌率又確定爲百元中儲券折合十八圓日圓，則其對於國內物價所能發生之良好影響，自可不言而喻；切望人民貶視通貨的心理，由此有所轉移，政府維持通貨的政策，由此益圖强化。</p>
<h3>證交總結束後實施現貨便交　定每週一辦理交割手續費率數額變更</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所，奉令復業專拍華商股票後，每日分午前午後兩市，前以開拍伊始，暫以隔日交割現貨爲主，　依照營業細則及章程之規定，得辦理定期及現期買賣，惟爲防止投機操縱起見，暫以現期買賣爲原則，頃循各經紀人之要求，隔日交割制度雖佳，惟因成交數額繁多，交割頗費時間，以致時有不及辦竣情事，所以擬實施現貨現交，規定　後每逢星期一辦理買進買出交割，聞此事正由有關當局考慮中，或將於過農曆總結束期後，於一月卅一日開市紅盤交易時，施行現貨便交，又交易所向各經紀人收取之手續費，改為千分之一，二五，而各經紀人向顧客所徽之手續費則為千分之五云。</p>
<h3>中儲行主辦第二次儲蓄週</h3>

<h3>中日紗布收買數額之觀感</h3>
<p>— 懷</p>
<p>全國商業統制總會奉命收買上海地區棉紗棉布以來，進行順利。成績良好，不得不歸功於中日紗布商人之深明大義，擁護國策。茲將商業統制會刋第三期所載之紗布收買數額，轉錄如下：</p>
<p>華商方面：　棉紗九萬二千一百零三包，　白坯棉布三萬五千五百零四包，（以四十疋合一包），　加工棉布十二萬五千五百六十八包。日商方面：　棉紗八萬一千六百零一包，　白坯棉布七萬五千八百六十五包，　加工棉布五萬七千七百二十包。華方紗布總數共計二十五萬三千一百七十五包，日方共計二十一萬五千一百八十六包，兩共四十六萬八千三百六十一包，合再將中日紗布商調查如下：</p>
<p>華商方面。。鈔廠（紗廠聯合會）三十二家，紗號（紗號業公會）約八百家，布廠（布廠業公會）約一千二百家，布號（布號業公會）約二千六百家。日商方面：紗廠（紡織聯合會）十一家，洋行（綿業聯合會）六十六家，布廠（工業聯合會）約三十家。華方共約四千六百家，日方共約一百零七家，觀於上列數字，不覺發一生下列種種感想：</p>
<p>面上華方申請出賣紗布，似較多於日方，但除去怡和綸昌等敵性工廠已屬於軍管理者，其棧單雖仍爲華商所持有，而貨物是否符合須俟將來實際檢收時，方可確定外，（見商業統制會刋第三期三十三頁），並須除去零售商與布廠之應得一月保留量及各種免除收買品，則華方收買紗布實數至多與日方相等。</p>
<p>四千六百家與一百零七家相較，約得四十三與一之比，但雙方出賣紗布數額竟相埒。華商方面除三十二家紗廠範圍稍大外，足見其餘悉屬小資經營，吾國工商業之散沒，狹隘，無可諱言。</p>
<p>華方加工棉布多於日方一倍有奇，白坯棉布反較少於日方一倍以下，顯見華商方面不但靑屬小資經營，且存貨亦多龐雜零星。加工棉布係指染色布印化品之類，什九爲衣着實際所需，非投機者所重視，其可供軍用者亦微，卒因業外人游　過剩之購儲，演成向業紗布者今日嚴重之後果。</p>
<p>日方紡織業因紗布收買移作其他工業生產或投資別種企業，（見商業統制會刋第三期十頁日本在華紡織業今後之新動向一文。）而華商方面旣悉屬小資經營紗布收買資金呆定，業務停頓，開支尙難維持，何來餘力，另闢一蹊徑。</p>
<p>中日紗布商人雖因一收買而同樣感到生活困難，但在滬日僑對於配給日常用品，尙能足用，仍可維持生活水準。華商方面雖亦有配給，然數量極徵，即以最主要之米煤而論，一月中之配給量，僅數數日之用，不足之數日不能不向黑市求之。華方紗布商以收買紗布公定價格一分期領到之價款，以易黑市米煤，其相去不可以道里計。</p>
<p>紗布價値旣有數十萬萬之巨，而華方紗布商又達四千六百家之多，則賴以生者何止數十萬人。最近烟賭舞三業雖經靑少團之嚴懲，然尙有死灰復燃之望。獨此紗布商人奄奄垂斃，生產停頓，長使巨量資金凍結，多數職工賦閒。或謂紗布價款一次付給，能使通貨膨脹，則緊縮通貨方法甚多，若必置紗布商於萬刦不復之地，方可使通貨緊縮，因噎廢食，竊以爲未可盡信，深望賢明當局，另籌適宜辦法，以善其後，亡羊補牢，猶未爲晚。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>立志（三）</p>
<p>但眞人越發專心研究柔道。那溫順的孩子，那樣在武道中使人們不明其所以然地，熱心研究着。</p>
<p>（谷的體格强壯起來了嗎……），走到練武塲來的大島先生，叉着手，遠望着真人在　技，在这样想着。</p>
<p>人的柔術，他的技　並不好。他本身就具有使身體柔軟而接受對手之力的天賦。那是柔道的本質，眞人的對乎，不知道這眞相，專喜歡同隨時可以打一下的一同練習。</p>
<p>眞人在研究柔道的中間，和同級的部員小森，親熱起來了。雖然不像好友條夫一樣，但和小森的交情，頗爲密切。小森在少年時筋肉就很堅實，性格也和真人及隆夫不同，可說是屬於鹿見島人的一種典型－西鄉型，不拘泥於小事，性格剛强，他聰了隆夫的海軍志願，就昂然抬起他烏黑的臉：「我的志願是陸軍。我想進幼年學校，但父親呌我到東京去。現在我在二中暫且忍耐着，四年之後，你們看吧！我就要通過陸軍士官學校的入學實驗了。</p>
<p>真人對於級友們都在那樣計劃他們的將來，非常羡慕，難道只有他孤獨地殘留在鹿見島，做銀行員嗎？－</p>
<p>這時候，薩摩地方的秋色灞老，到了參拜妙圓寺的日子。陰歷九月十四日，是義弘公在關原敗北的日子。在紀念這一天，自古以來，薩摩地方的靑少年，徒步走着五里的路程，　著堤所伊集院的妙　寺去參拜。好勝的薩摩人。這和「毋忘關原」的常地慣用　有深切的關係。如把那句話翻譯成標準語時，就是「勿忘此時」的意思。全體日本國民，决不忘却日淸戰後的三國干涉，問樣，直到現在，　　人不會忘却　原的屈辱。</p>
<p>但是近來的好年，　於惰弱，甚至有把參拜妙圓寺不當一回事的人。眞是不勝慨嘆。「在那天，山形縣人的武山先生，遵樣吿誠學生。就是別地的人，如其來　摩，就染上薩摩氣質。</p>
<p>二中的學生，以喇叭隊爲先導，唱着參拜妙圓寺的進軍歌，越過水上坂，前去行參拜禮，禮畢歸校，巳輕是費昏時候了。然而到明晨，有一個學生，一跳一拐地向武山先生面報吿：「我昨天晚上又去了。」</p>
<p>因不眠而浮踵的眼泡下面，閃着烏亮的眼珠睜著先生。</p>
<p>武山先生起初不能懂那話的意思，不久，就明白了眞相。原來那學生跟大家歸來之後，一個人獨自又去了一次。一晝夜走了來回二次二十裡的路程，那就是小森，從此以後，真人愈加喜歡的小森了。</p>

        <h1>1944.01.13</h1>
<h3>Another Word to the Rice Control Committee</h3>
<p>According to a report on the 7th of this month, Director Yuan of the Rice Control Committee stated that the procurement progress in areas A and B was very good. By the end of December, 3.1 million shi (石) had already been procured. The first batch of over 300,000 shi had already arrived in Shanghai, enough to supply the entire city for over a month, to be used as a special allocation for the Lunar New Year. After repeated discussions, the distribution of household rice in the city has been decided by the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee to be restored to three times a month, with two sheng (升) per distribution, starting from January 11th of the 33rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1944]. Once this is realized, the need for black market rice will naturally decrease. As supply and demand gradually move toward balance, rice prices should naturally fall, and the future livelihood of the citizens should gradually become more stable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, areas one and two of the city distributed the 59th distribution of household rice, increased to two sheng. In the past four months, household rice was only allocated one sheng per distribution. This time it has been increased to two sheng. The comparison of the two is somewhat satisfactory. It is also the first step in confirming what the Rice Control Committee authorities have stated.</p>
<p>However, in fact, the price of black market rice continues to jump, and the threat has not diminished. To be honest, before we citizens receive an adequate amount of rationed rice, and before the threat of black market rice prices is completely eliminated, we can never be satisfied with the authorities' optimistic statements and partial adjustments. At the same time, we believe that if the authorities are determined and truly devote their efforts to the problem of food for the people, and proceed with courage and decisiveness, then satisfying the demands of the citizens is by no means an impossible task, and is indeed a matter of certainty. Let us cite one example to fully prove this.</p>
<p>As Director Yuan stated above, the Rice Control Committee has already procured 3.1 million shi in areas A and B, and over 300,000 shi have been shipped to Shanghai, enough to supply the citizens of Shanghai for more than a month. Based on this calculation, the rice procured by the Rice Control Committee in more than four months is enough to supply the citizens of Shanghai for a year. Then, isn't satisfying the demands of the citizens a matter of certainty? However, according to our estimation, the average monthly need for grain per person is 1.5 dou (斗). Taking the city's population as 4 million, the monthly rice requirement is 600,000 shi. Although this differs from the authorities' estimate by half, considering the amount procured by the Rice Control Committee, it is not impossible to supply the citizens for more than five months with the rice procured in four months.</p>
<p>Based on the above estimate, it can be confidently said that if the Rice Control Committee handles matters properly, it is very likely to provide an adequate supply, satisfy the needs of the citizens, and completely eliminate the black market. But how can matters be handled properly? We have made suggestions repeatedly in the past, and now, without being verbose, we will present the authorities with our points again:</p>
<p>First, distinguish between good and bad, and severely punish corruption. The Rice Control Committee is a new organization, an organization that is related to the welfare of the masses. Corruption should absolutely be eliminated, refreshing the eyes and ears of the people. Since the matter involves control, the "benefits" of corruption are extremely large, making it very easy for unscrupulous elements to be tempted to engage in corruption. Therefore, we strongly advocate that the Rice Control Committee authorities should be careful in employing people. If corruption is discovered, they must not show favoritism and must punish offenders according to the law, so as to gain the trust of the people and at the same time obtain more enthusiastic assistance from the Allied nations. However, we have heard that a certain staff member of the committee is suspected of corruption, causing public uproar. Although the case has been reported to the court, the offender has already escaped. This is absolutely not thorough and damages the entire credibility of the Rice Control Committee. At the same time, staff members of the Commercial Control Committee are also engaging in corruption. It is said that they are still in detention and under interrogation. Both are new control organizations, both involve staff members engaging in corruption, but the punishments are different. This is something that the Rice Control Committee authorities should reflect on and pay attention to.</p>
<p>Second, adjust personnel and reorganize. Although the Rice Control Committee is only a new organization established a few months ago, the personnel are complex, and there are many factions, often leading to restraints and delays. It is not difficult to imagine that with such personnel, handling matters properly is like heading south to go north. We believe that the authorities should be determined to thoroughly reorganize, eliminate factions, and use talent as the only standard, matching people to positions and positions to people. If this is not done, it will be difficult to fulfill the major mission, and all talk and statements will become empty promises that cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Third, the authority should be unified. The Rice Control Committee's original responsibilities were procurement, storage, transportation, and distribution. In fact, without these responsibilities, it is not easy to exert its functions. However, now the Rice Control Committee only manages the procurement aspect, while storage, transportation, and distribution are not under its control. We believe that since the Rice Control Committee is located in Shanghai, at least the distribution matters in this city should be handled directly by the committee, to assign responsibility and prevent excuses for shirking responsibility. Therefore, we advocate that the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee should be merged into the Rice Control Committee, or at least assume the responsibility for procurement and distribution, unifying authority. At the same time, the organization of the Rice Control Committee should be strengthened to enable it to fully fulfill its responsibilities.</p>
<p>We believe that the above three points are the correct medicine for the Rice Control Committee to fulfill its responsibilities. Rather than issue more empty promises and lose credibility, it is better to be practical and grasp the key points for implementation. The voice of the citizens is the fairest criticism; right is right, and wrong is wrong, and we will never call a deer a horse. At the same time, we have always believed that if the household rice supply is sufficient, the black market rice will naturally disappear, disappearing on its own. Before the household rice supply is sufficient, if one wants to forcibly buy up black market rice in an attempt to eliminate it, then black market rice will never disappear, and will only cause the black market to rise even higher. Because the supply is insufficient, the shortage must be obtained from the black market. If there is no black market, wouldn't people starve to death? Since it is called the black market, it is originally not open. Therefore, on the surface, the black market is prohibited, and although the black market may be reduced on the surface, insiders take advantage of special conveniences to secretly operate, thus causing the black market to become even higher. Citizens, unwilling to starve to death, endure the pain and seek it. This is actually even more harmful to the people. Therefore, we consistently advocate, "Replace smuggling with public transportation; replace the black market with official prices." The black market must be eliminated, but it must be replaced with household rice at official prices. It is absolutely not just about eliminating the black market without providing an adequate supply. An adequate supply is the "root." Eliminating the black market is the "branch." "Abandoning the root" and only knowing how to "pursue the branch" is certainly not the proper way. We repeat our arguments and wish the Rice Control Committee authorities and related parties to pay close attention to them.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on New Britain Island, Japanese Troops Bravely Repel the Enemy; Enemy Attempts to Cross the River at Torokina Fail</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain location in the South Pacific: The landing battle on New Britain Island is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy forces are attempting to achieve their ambitions under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, but their attempts have been thwarted by the Japanese forces for days, and they have suffered heavy losses. The enemy forces in the Walawane area of Borgen Bay, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, repeatedly attacked. The Japanese forces immediately fought back vigorously, stopping their advance. However, by the afternoon of the 10th, the enemy forces had advanced to a location one kilometer south of Triangle Mountain. The front lines of the two armies were only 100 meters apart, and they are currently in a stalemate. In total, from the 1st to the 10th, the enemy forces lost 41 corpses, and approximately 200 were wounded. The Japanese side suffered almost no losses. As for the battle situation on the Cape Gloucester front, the Japanese forces, after recapturing the Aerodrome Aroe, continued to advance eastward. On the 6th, it was discovered that the enemy forces were attempting to attack, so a preemptive strike was launched, crushing their attempt. In this battle, the enemy forces left 30 corpses, and the Japanese forces captured four light machine guns and a large quantity of automatic rifles and rifle ammunition.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: Enemy forces on the Torokina front of Bougainville Island secretly infiltrated men, and at night they attempted to infiltrate an area north of the Sava River crossing point. After the Japanese forces discovered this, they immediately engaged them, and after about an hour of fierce fighting, the enemy soldiers were routed. In this battle, the enemy forces abandoned three corpses, and the Japanese forces captured three automatic rifles and 2,050 rounds of ammunition. The Japanese side suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: In the Marshall Islands area, enemy aircraft have recently launched repeated attacks. On the afternoon of the 9th, approximately a dozen enemy North American B-25 aircraft carried out low-altitude strafing at Engebi. The Japanese naval garrison bravely fought back and repelled them. On the 11th, eleven enemy aircraft of unknown type attacked Tarawa Island and were also repelled by the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Japanese naval garrison. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Southern India-Burma Border, Japanese Forces on High Alert; Enemy Attempt to Attack Maungdaw Repelled</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the Burma front, enemy forces on the India-Burma border have recently been gradually increasing their troop strength in the Maungdaw area, attempting to launch from the India-Burma border in order to recapture Maungdaw. However, they have all been repelled by the Japanese forces defending the area. Currently, the defenses in the southern India-Burma border area, centered on Maungdaw, are extremely tight, making it difficult for the enemy to take advantage of any opportunities. On the night of the 8th, 150 enemy soldiers attempted to infiltrate an area north of Maungdaw, but were immediately repelled by the Japanese forces after being discovered. On the morning of the 9th, enemy forces attacked the eastern area of Maungdaw. The Japanese forces often launched encirclements and suppressions from the north and west. The Japanese forces began actively attacking enemy forces in the Tanaungchaung river bend on the morning of the 10th, and the operations are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Results</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base, enemy air force offensives on the India-Burma border are becoming increasingly fierce, and they are frequently launching air raids on various parts of Burma. The Japanese military air force has inflicted heavy blows on these stubborn enemies, achieving brilliant battle results. The Japanese air force's excellent combat skills have already shocked the enemy. According to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 4th of this month, the combined battle results of the Japanese air force in the Burma area during December of last year were extremely impressive. According to the results verified by the local authorities and announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, a total of 123 enemy aircraft were shot down and destroyed. If the aircraft that exploded or caught fire are added, the number reaches 152. In the same month, the damage inflicted on enemy ships, warehouses, and other facilities in that area has also proven the greatness of the Japanese air force's combat power. The details of the combined battle results are recorded below: 104 enemy aircraft shot down, 35 destroyed, 12 enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground, totaling 152 (according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters, 104 were shot down, 19 were destroyed, totaling 123). During this period, the Japanese aircraft suffered a total of 22 losses, including those that self-destructed without returning and those that were heavily damaged (according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters, the number was 24). In addition, during the various offensive operations, the Japanese aircraft sank five enemy 5,000-ton ships, two medium-sized ships, and six 6,000-ton or 7,000-ton ships, for a total of 13 ships. In addition, 12 warehouses, docks, and other facilities were destroyed, causing large fires, 12 railway facilities were damaged, and many vehicles and military supply storage sites were destroyed. He arrived in Manila at 5:30 p.m. on the 11th. Ambassador Murata and various Japanese and Philippine dignitaries were present to welcome him. The ambassador disembarked and went to the Manila Hotel and had a long conversation with Ambassador Murata. On the 12th, he went to the Philippine presidential palace at 10:00 a.m. and had a long talk with President Laurel before departing. He then visited Foreign Minister Lecut and the highest commanders of the Japanese army and navy.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Aizawa Arrives in Manila, Will Soon Return to Japan</h3>
<p>Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam Aizawa, in order to confer with the government in his country on important matters, is making a trip back to Japan.</p>
<h3>One U.S. Destroyer Attacked</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, a fleet composed of U.S. cruisers and destroyers shelled the island of Poporang, south of St. Eran Island, on the night of the 8th. The Japanese navy immediately responded, and a fierce artillery battle ensued. As a result, one U.S. destroyer was destroyed, and two others were heavily damaged and fled. Japanese damage was very light.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Citizens Hold Non-Cooperative Attitude Towards U.S. Air Force, Hindering Anti-Axis Military Operations Against Japan</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Guilin, the American representative of the Guilin branch of the U.S. Air Force Replenishment Department recently complained to a reporter from Ta Kung Pao about the Chongqing citizens' non-cooperative attitude towards the U.S. Air Force, hoping to prompt the Chongqing citizens to reflect on this. From this, it can be seen how deep-seated the Chongqing citizens' resentment towards the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is, which is extremely noteworthy. According to the American's statement: "It is a universally recognized opinion that the anti-Axis military offensive against Japan began from Chongqing territory. We have continued to work to realize this strategy until today. However, the reason why it has not yet been concretely realized is due to the non-cooperative attitude of the Chongqing citizens. Since the formation of the U.S.-Chongqing mixed air force, the attitude of Chongqing officials towards the U.S. Air Force has improved somewhat, but not thoroughly. The general public has even less intention of cooperating. What causes us the most pain is that it is extremely difficult to obtain daily necessities for our soldiers. Therefore, Chongqing merchants take advantage of the scarcity to arbitrarily raise the prices of daily necessities for foreigners in order to make a profit. U.S. Air Force soldiers have become the targets of these people's exploitation. Therefore, the daily needs of U.S. Air Force soldiers have to rely on supplies from India, but this greatly hinders the transportation of military supplies. If military supplies and armaments cannot be transported in large quantities and smoothly, then the anti-Axis military offensive against Japan launched from Chongqing territory is impossible to realize. If Chongqing citizens hope for an anti-Japanese counteroffensive, they should cooperate with the U.S. military from the bottom of their hearts."</p>
<h3>Important Resolutions of the Legal Provisions Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Legal Provisions Revision Committee of the Ministry of Judicial Administration held its third meeting yesterday, chaired by Hu Zewu. The important resolution was the passage of the draft regulations on the passage of amended laws. These regulations are related to international private law and have been carefully studied and revised in detail by the committee. The draft has now been organized and passed and submitted to the Ministry for review. In addition, the regulations on the jurisdiction of lawsuits involving foreigners in China and the regulations on foreign lawyers practicing law are also important rules for judicial application after the recovery of legal rights. The original draft was designated to be reviewed by Committee Member Liu Zhiyong and Councilor Qian Sen of the committee. Based on the written opinions submitted, this meeting was convened, and Committee Member Huang Qingzhong, Committee Member Kang Huandong, and Councilor Lin Wenhai were appointed for a second review.</p>
<h3>Several U.S. Bombers Attacked Taiwan Last Night, Dropping Bombs Near Kaohsiung and Yanshui</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to a Taipei telephone report, the Japanese military in Taiwan announced on the afternoon of the 12th that several enemy bombers had crossed the Japanese military warning net around 10:00 p.m. on the 11th and flew to the vicinity of Kaohsiung and Yanshui (30 kilometers north of Tainan) in Taiwan to drop bombs. They immediately fled. Japanese casualties were only one dead and fifteen injured. The enemy aircraft involved in this attack seemed to have flown from a base in Chongqing. The mission of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has apparently shifted from bombing Japanese military-occupied territories in China to seeking opportunities to control the skies over Japan itself. However, the air defenses of the Japanese military in China and the Japanese mainland are extremely strict. Unable to achieve their ambitions, they attempted to carry out guerrilla-style bombing of Taiwan, which is in close proximity, in order to exaggerate their strength to domestic and foreign audiences. It is recalled that on November 25th of last year, approximately 20 U.S. aircraft attacked Shinchiku, Taiwan, and three were shot down by the Japanese military. This time, the attack occurred again at night, so the damage on the ground was very slight.</p>

<h3>84th Japanese Diet to Reconvene Next Week; Government-Proposed Bills All Decided</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The 84th Japanese Diet will reconvene on the 21st. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has held two ordinary Diet sessions and four extraordinary Diet sessions. Each Diet session has been convened in response to the current war situation and has achieved significant results. This Diet session will take the critical war situation as its backdrop, so it is expected to yield significant results in increasing production and forcefully promoting various policies. The active cooperation of the Diet authorities has enabled each past Diet session to achieve its goals. The statements made by Prime Minister Tojo and the Japanese government authorities, as well as the Diet's deliberations, have attracted attention both domestically and internationally. Therefore, when the Diet reconvenes, the Prime Minister's policy address, the reports of government officials on the current war situation, and the Diet's questions and discussions reflecting the people's desire to complete the war are especially anticipated. The Japanese government and the Diet have become one. Therefore, the Diet will certainly be able to comply with the government's policies and exert the essence of a wartime Diet. The rapid progress of the government's proposals and the early decision on the budget will make the deliberation progress even faster than the previous Diet, and it will be completed in the shortest possible time. Both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives will be able to engage in deliberation rapidly within this month. The number of legal cases for this Diet session in Japan has been reduced by half compared to the previous Diet. Among them, the most noteworthy are several cases such as the tax increase bill. Therefore, the Diet's discussions will not focus on the bills themselves, but on the fundamental issues behind the bills, especially regarding the food problem, national mobilization, and enhanced transportation capacity, which are important political issues this year. Valuable opinions will be generated. Furthermore, how the government expresses its policies regarding these issues is also noteworthy. Increasing the production of aircraft is currently the most important thing for Japan, and this is gradually getting on track. However, in order to promote the increased production of aircraft, concrete measures must be taken in terms of labor, food, and transportation. This point will be intensely reviewed when the Diet reconvenes. The Support Association held a plenary meeting on the 8th to prepare for the reconvening of the Diet. On the government side, all the bills have been decided before the 11th, and only the supplementary budget remains. Therefore, it is expected that it can also be completely decided before the 14th. Preparations for the Diet have progressed smoothly in all areas, and the integration of the government and the Support Association has become even closer. Because the connection between the two is extremely smooth, it is expected that the Diet will be able to fully exert the meaning of a decisive Diet when it reconvenes.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battle for Sarny in Progress; Battle Resumes in Perekop Isthmus</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas: The pressure of some key points in the Soviet winter offensive eased slightly on Monday, but this is only temporary, as the Soviet forces are slightly redeploying and replenishing before continuing their fierce attacks. The situation northwest, southwest, and south of Vitebsk remains unchanged. The enemy's offensive west of Rechitsa has been contained, and the German front line in that area has not been seriously threatened. The defense of Sarny, west of the former Polish border, suddenly broke out on the 10th and is still in fierce fighting. The Soviet right wing attempted to turn in from the southwest, but was also blocked by the German forces and has not yet been able to merge with the fighting west of Berdichev. The Soviet left wing under Konev launched a large-scale attack on the German positions from southwest of Dnepropetrovsk to Krivoy Rog, but the results achieved by the Soviet forces in that area are not yet significant. Furthermore, the offensive in the Perekop Isthmus has been resumed. It is not yet clear whether this is the prelude to a Soviet general offensive on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Message to Congress Explains Diplomatic Policy Goals</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington: President Roosevelt requested in his opening message to Congress yesterday that Congress grant him full authority to implement compulsory labor. He explained his motives, saying that the total mobilization of the people is a prerequisite for final victory.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Central News Agency) - After suggesting compulsory labor in his message to Congress, Roosevelt followed with five legislative procedures, including: international tax rates, the continuation of negotiating arms contracts, food prices, the early re-implementation of the economic stabilization law, and the National Service Act. Roosevelt said that the main goal of his foreign policy is "security." He said: "To those who feel apprehensive, I say that they worry that Mr. Hull and I have made agreements on future measures, causing our country to be bound by secret treaties or play the role of 'Santa Claus' (meaning to work for others). What I want to say is that Churchill, Stalin, and Chiang Kai-shek should all have a thorough understanding of the limitations of our Constitution, as do Hull and I. Indeed, we have agreed, we have indeed agreed to a vast and very clear military plan. This plan requires the military forces of all Allied nations to achieve the goal of defeating the enemy in the earliest possible time, but there are no secret treaties or political or financial agreements. The highest future goal we have discussed, whether for the countries themselves or for the overall plan of the countries, can be summarized in one word: 'Security'."</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Attack Germany on a Large Scale, Over 100 Shot Down, Proving Germany's Consolidated Air Defenses</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - A special communiqué issued by the German Führer Headquarters stated: U.S. bomber squadrons launched a major attack on central Germany on the 11th, but were unable to achieve any results under the strong German defenses. According to reports as of today, German fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft gun crews shot down a total of 133 U.S. bombers, mostly four-engine aircraft. However, according to more detailed information obtained later, it was determined that the number of aircraft shot down included 124 heavy bombers, for a total of 136.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (German News Agency) - German News Agency reported: No fewer than 78 U.S. aircraft were shot down during the U.S. air raid on German central territory on Tuesday, most of which were four-engine bombers. This was the first attempt by U.S. bombers to attack German territory without fighter escorts since October 1943. As a result, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Germany's well-organized defenses finally stopped the concentrated enemy attack, so Germany's victory is particularly important.</p>
<h3>US Forces in Italy Continue Offensive, Cassino as Target</h3>
<p>Lisbon, December 12th, Central News Agency dispatch: Comprehensive reports from the southern Italian front indicate that the US Fifth Army, taking advantage of the German retreat from San Vittore, is continuing to send successive waves of troops northward, aiming to capture Cassino in one fell swoop. Fierce fighting is currently centered around Caira, four kilometers south of Cassino. However, the German forces have prepared ironclad defenses around Cassino. Future attacks on the city by the anti-Axis forces will result in significant damage in terms of manpower and material resources. According to a United Press dispatch from Algiers, although US forces reached a point on the 11th from which Cassino could be seen in the distance, they still need to break through numerous German strongholds before reaching the city. Anti-Axis air forces have recently intensified their bombing of various parts of the Italian Peninsula, with Ancona, Pola, and San Benedetto del Tronto being bombed on the 11th.</p>
<h3>West Sea Port Converted into Torpedo Boat Base</h3>

<h3>Detailed Record of the Italian Coup Case Trial: Ciano and Others Executed</h3>
<p>Verona, December 12th, Central News Agency dispatch via Reuters: It was announced here yesterday afternoon that Ciano, General Bono, and others, including Barrese, Gotardi, and Marinelli, were executed at 9:00 AM on the 11th after being sentenced to death. The charges were treason and collaboration with the enemy, betraying Fascism under the guise of peace, and undermining the nation's resistance and military operations. Among them, Sineti, although sentenced to death, had his sentence commuted to thirty years imprisonment due to the relatively minor nature of his case. The remaining eighteen were all sentenced to death.</p>
<p>The trial began on the 8th of this month and concluded at 2:00 PM on the 10th. The first to be questioned during the trial was</p>
<p>General Bono. Bono argued that during the Fascist Party's Supreme Council meeting on July 24th, Grandi detailed seven plans and the urgent need to establish a constitution. At that time, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that if the King personally commanded the troops, he would be forced to take drastic measures. Bono then denied having any contact with the royal family. Next was Barrese.</p>
<p>Barrese argued that he was not surprised by the negative attitudes of the military generals described by the Italian Prime Minister, as similar negative attitudes also existed within the Ministry of Agriculture. Mussolini also stated at the time that Grandi's agenda was inappropriate during this period of military difficulty. Next was Sineti.</p>
<p>Sineti, in addition to</p>
<p>describing his care for workers and his experiences in combat in Albania, stated that he had noticed the treasonous activities of staff officers and other high-ranking military officers. When he read the first paragraph of Grandi's resolution, strongly stating the necessity for the Fascist Party to take action to defend the country, he was extremely moved and did not read the rest of it. If he had suspected that Grandi was a traitor, he would never have signed it. Examining</p>
<p>Gotardi, his reply stated that his signature on the resolution was intended to alleviate the heavy military burden borne by Mussolini. Marinelli's reply was similar to Gotardi's.</p>
<p>Ciano's reply</p>
<p>stated that the resolution presented to the Supreme Council was different from the original resolution sent to him before the Supreme Council meeting. He also met Grandi during the Fascist Trade Union Conference, who showed him the revised resolution. The reason he did not inform Mussolini of this new development was that he had very little contact with his father-in-law after resigning as Foreign Minister. Ciano then stated that overthrowing Mussolini would ultimately lead to our own destruction, so overthrowing Mussolini was not justified. However, he believed that Grandi's resolution was merely intended to unite the country, so he signed Grandi's resolution. His action was a mistake, but definitely not an act of treason. Among the testimonies of the accused, the most important was the chief judge reading</p>
<p>Marshal Caviglia's memorandum. This memorandum detailed the marshal's own position regarding the coup that occurred on July 25th of last year. It was an extremely important document in the verdict. Marshal Caviglia had been secretly planning to overthrow Mussolini since mid-September of last year. After the anti-Axis forces landed in Sicily, Marshal Caviglia's plan became more concrete. He began to speak to Italian government authorities and members of the Chamber of Deputies, and then met with Marshal Badoglio and General Acquarone, all of whom agreed to use constitutional methods in the Fascist Grand Council to achieve the goal of overthrowing Mussolini.</p>
<p>The chief judge then described the conspiracy of the traitors as follows: This rebellion was a political conspiracy by Fascist Party members, a collaboration between Marshal Caviglia and Badoglio, and a military conspiracy. They planned to achieve their goals through constitutional means. However, as the war situation deteriorated, Mussolini decided to mobilize all Fascist Party members to arouse the nation's fighting spirit and convened a Grand Council in Rome. Although this Grand Council was aware of the inevitable outcome of choosing the resolution, Clanci and others handed over all legal and political power to the King to overthrow the Fascist regime. From this perspective, the treasonous behavior of the accused is clear, so they are sentenced to death according to national law. Then, the defense lawyers of each defendant began their arguments. After four hours of deliberation, the result was the announcement that Ciano and four others were sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Dispatch from Hankou: US Planes Stationed in Chongqing Indiscriminately Bomb Merchant Vessels</h3>
<p>Thousands of Passengers Drowned at the Bottom of the River, Scattered Corpses Awaiting Salvage</p>
<p>US planes stationed in Chongqing have repeatedly disregarded humanitarian principles and engaged in indiscriminate bombing, resulting in the sacrifice of innocent civilians. The unprecedented tragedy that recently occurred at Madangkou is particularly infuriating. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, the Pingshan and Kuoyang river steamers departed Jiujiang at 11:00 AM. As they approached Madangkou around noon, three planes from Chongqing were spotted flying in the sky. Upon seeing the two vessels, they dropped bombs. The Pingshan steamer was hit by an incendiary bomb, and flames soared into the sky, completely consuming the ship. Fortunately, the ship had reached the riverbank, and most of the passengers escaped. However, the Kuoyang steamer sank quickly after being hit, and all the thousand-plus passengers inside the cabins struggled to escape. Because the ship was entirely made of iron plates with only two or three exits, the tilting and sinking of the ship inevitably resulted in people pressing on top of each other, making it difficult to retrieve the bodies. According to Chinese tradition, bodies of those who drown rise to the surface after seven days in cold weather and three days in hot weather. In the case of the Zhenyang ship, the bodies cannot be recovered without making an effort to salvage them. As time passes, there is a risk of decomposition. There were still about eighty or ninety passengers on the deck who had not been submerged. They were rescued at 6:00 PM and returned to Jiujiang. They were comforted by Chinese and Japanese military police and the Jiujiang branch of the World Red Swastika Society. In addition to providing hot tea and clothing, each person was given 200 yuan for travel expenses and a pass issued by the Japanese Kempeitai, and were sent back to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Corpses Without Burial</p>
<p>The Chongqing planes, using the cruel methods of the Americans, bombed innocent civilians, resulting in thousands of deaths. This atrocity is hateful. Among the refugees, some families suffered together. Think about it: who in this world doesn't have parents, siblings, spouses, children, or relatives? How can one not grieve upon hearing this tragic news? Moreover, the corpses are missing, leading to eternal regret. Fortunately, it is currently the dead of winter, making decomposition slower. If efforts can be made to salvage the bodies, the families can claim them. However, this is a major undertaking, and cannot be accomplished without the assistance of people from all walks of life.</p>
<p>How to Deal with the Aftermath</p>
<p>I hope that the Shanghai fellow-provincials associations, charitable organizations, and philanthropists, uphold the spirit of human mutual assistance, and in view of this unprecedented tragedy, quickly organize an aftermath committee to register the families of the deceased and take steps to salvage the bodies in advance, providing all possible convenience to the families to claim the bodies at the scene of the accident, in order to prevent decomposition over time. It is said that the World Red Swastika Society is particularly adept at this type of work. If the Society can be put in charge, there will surely be good results, and the families of the victims will receive some comfort. It is truly a great deed. (Yun Cen, sent on January 5th)</p>

<p>Mr. Uchiyama Donates Scholarship Funds</p>
<p>Because of the large number of students applying for assistance, this newspaper has appealed to compassionate individuals from all walks of life for sympathy and support. Yesterday, Mr. Uchiyama Kanzo, the owner of Uchiyama Bookstore, a friendly country, generously donated 5,000 yuan for scholarship funds. Mr. Uchiyama is a famous Sinologist from our friendly nation, with very close ties to people in Chinese cultural circles. He has expressed deep sympathy for the scholarship movement. Among the people of the allied nations, he is the first to donate a large sum of money this year, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Readers from All Walks of Life Rise Up to Support</p>
<p>The colleagues of the New Star Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote yesterday, stating that in these troubled times, people are suffering everywhere. It is especially difficult for outstanding students to study. They have specifically included a letter from the company's employees, which roughly states: "We deeply admire the Shen Bao's charitable act of providing scholarships. However, because we are all wage earners, we are unable to respond. We are now pooling together 1,000 yuan from the money given by customers over the past six months and donating it to the scholarship fund. Although we know it is a small amount, we hope to use it to arouse the sympathy of those with the means to donate generously."</p>
<p>What is Received from Society is Returned to Society</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Jue, a student who received scholarship money from this newspaper, wrote yesterday, stating: "From the beginning of receiving scholarship money from this newspaper, my strict father instructed me: 'What you receive from society today, you must return to society a hundredfold in the future, and you must always help those who are unable to attend school in the future.'" I am now returning 200 yuan. If I can find a job, I will continue to donate, so as not to betray the kindness of society and the instructions of my strict father.</p>

<h3>Director of Press Department Izuchi Discusses Recent War Situation: Striving for Victory in the Last Five Minutes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: At the regular meeting with the Chinese Journalists Corps held by the Japanese Army Press Department yesterday (the 12th) afternoon at 3:00 PM, Director of Press Department Izuchi made the following statement on the recent war situation:</p>
<p>As the Greater East Asia War enters a critical juncture of life and death, we are making every effort to prepare for a counterattack, and Japan is also making the same preparations, uniting with all the nations of Greater East Asia. We are preparing for a decisive battle in this war. Every person in the nations of East Asia has the determination to complete the war. In the past year, the United States, in order to cover up the defeats in the initial stages of the war, on the one hand, heavily publicized its efforts to win back the hearts of the people, and on the other hand, made various attempts to recover lost territory. However, due to the bravery of the Japanese troops and the thoroughness of their preparations, they have not succeeded to this day. I will now detail the recent war situation of the enemy, the United States:</p>
<p>Enemy's Progress in Counteroffensive Obstructed</p>
<p>The enemy, the United States, has launched counteroffensives in the North Pacific, South Pacific, and recently in the Central Pacific, while bombing Chongqing, attempting to use the western mainland as a base to attack the Japanese mainland. To this day, this attempt has not disappeared. The Aleutian Islands in the north and the Solomon Islands can be said to be Japan's outer defense line. Because of Japan's bloody battles, the enemy, Britain, has never succeeded. However, relying on their numerical superiority, they are constantly trying to stimulate a lucky counteroffensive to realize their strategy of gaining an island at a time. However, each time, they have fallen into Japan's strategy. The naval and air battles at Bougainville, Gilbert, and Marshall, and the landing battles at New Britain, Manus, and Gloucester have caused them to lose more than 100,000 troops before they even landed. Regarding New Guinea, Finschhafen, Gilbert, Tarawa, Makin, Bougainville, New Britain, etc., the enemy landing forces have suffered significant losses after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army. Their military progress has been obstructed as a result, and they are still in the midst of fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Always Advancing in Bloody Battles</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to an 8th day dispatch from Reuters Sydney, "Japanese infantry units have climbed the target of New Britain and launched a sudden attack in the early morning. The bravery of the fighting is unexpected. Japanese units disregard all damage and always advance bravely, deep into the American line, engaging in heroic hand-to-hand combat. And in the Gloucester mountain gorge, the Japanese army fired strong artillery fire from jungle fortress positions, and are still engaged in fierce fighting." This proves that the Japanese army is always advancing in bloody battles, in a desolate and extreme situation. However, we must not ignore the enemy's counteroffensive, because at this critical juncture of life and death, the enemy's counteroffensive force will be fierce in order to avoid a complete defeat. Secondly, because the enemy's combat distance is too close to the Japanese front line, they are suffering great blows.</p>
<p>In the past year, the number of American planes destroyed by the Japanese army has reached more than 390. Whether in the front or rear airports, and other facilities, they have all been destroyed by the Japanese army. One more point, Britain, the United States and Chongqing always stand in their own positions and want to launch a battle to seize Burma. They heavily promoted the counteroffensive after the rainy season last year, but before the counteroffensive was launched, Chongqing completely collapsed in the battle of the Nu River in October of the same year. At the same time, on the other hand, Chongqing took advantage of the opportunity of Mountbatten's appointment as commander of Southeast Asia to launch a war. Although Chongqing had this intention, the result was that it was deceived by Britain and the United States and stood at the forefront as a sacrifice for Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>In addition, the enemy's efforts to aid the US Air Force in Chongqing, risking attacks from the Japanese army, and the difficulties of the climate to provide relief, the US chamber army has flown over the peaks of the Himalayas at an altitude of 17,000 feet, which shows that they are willing to sacrifice to provide relief to the US Air Force in Chongqing. The reason they do this is due to the obstruction of the Japanese army, but although we absolutely trust the strength of the Japanese Air Force, in order to completely destroy the invasion of the US Air Force, the local troops are still working hard to find ways to curb the activities of the US Air Force.</p>
<p>The War Has Entered the Third Stage</p>
<p>As for this war, whether it will be a long-term or short-term conclusion, no one can predict it, but we always hope to have a quick victory. Under the conditions of a quick victory, we have to maintain a long-term determination to fight.</p>
<p>I will analyze the results of this war based on past war history and divide it into three stages. In the first stage, in the beginning, small countries were threatened by the oppression of large countries, so that their national survival was threatened. Under this situation, they must resist large countries and fight to protect their territory and resources. However, small countries do not have the power to destroy large countries in one fell swoop. Their attacking power must reach a certain limit. At the same time, they strive to increase their combat power. Large countries also engage in strengthening their combat power at this time. During this period, large countries will definitely take advantage of the fact that small countries have no combat power to progress and give them a heavy blow. In small countries, they must engage in increasing and enriching their combat power internally, and prevent the attacks of large countries externally. At this time, the most difficult thing is the second stage. The attacking power of large countries must not be able to continue its pressure on small countries when it reaches a certain limit, and it will gradually weaken. In small countries, they have escaped danger, and the internal combat power reserve is full, equal to that of large countries. However, in order to complete the war, they must continue to fight. Only at this time is the war the most difficult for both sides. Among the people, it is inevitable that there will be some weariness. As long as the country is united, endures hardship, and fights bravely, you can win the crown of victory in the last five minutes.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is now in the third stage, and this year is the only the third stage, so only by fighting for the last five minutes can we achieve the final victory.</p>

<h3>Three Provinces Track and Field Team Triumphant Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The track and field team of the Shanghai Three Provinces Sports Association dispatched ten long-distance running athletes to Beijing last Saturday (the 8th) to participate in a 5,000-meter cross-country demonstration race. As a result, Lou Wenao took first place, Wang Zhenglin came in second, Sun Zhifang took third, Wan Jinsheng fourth, Qiu Xingqing fifth, Qian Zhenxing sixth, Luo Da seventh, Wang Zhiyi eighth, Lin Yongqiutaro ninth, and Okamura Noboru tenth. The Three Provinces team swept the top eight places, which is truly commendable. However, since Luo Da resides in Nanjing and was a formal racer when he registered, he was named the overall Beijing champion. Recently, the Three Provinces team independently organized a 66-Chinese-mile (approximately 33 km) around-the-city race. Seven people participated, starting from Xinjiekou. Except for Lou Wenao, who withdrew midway due to leg cramps, the rest completed the entire journey. Veteran Wang Zhenglin was the first to reach the finish line with a time of one hour, thirty-five minutes, nineteen and two-tenths seconds. Wan Jinsheng took second place, Wang Junsheng third, Zhou Ruquan fourth, Sun Zhifang fifth, and Luo Da sixth. The team returned to Shanghai in triumph a few days ago (the 11th), led by team leader Zhang Baokui Qi and others.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>The New Status of Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>A country's currency must possess two qualities: one is its legal tender status, and the other is its liquidity. If a legal tender lacks smooth circulation, its value will inevitably be criticized. Regarding the status of Central Reserve Bank (CRB) notes, since the Japanese authorities, at the behest of the Allies, ceased issuing military scrip and new banknotes on April 1 last year, CRB notes have become the sole legal tender in Central and Southern China. Therefore, the era of co-use of military scrip and CRB notes has transitioned to an era of exclusive use of CRB notes, establishing the currency status that CRB notes should have in the country.</p>
<p>Now, with the Central Reserve Bank and the Yokohama Specie Bank signing a foreign exchange agreement to implement centralized foreign exchange between Central and Southern China and southern countries such as Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, CRB notes also possess the function of an international trade currency. Subjectively speaking, the value of this measure lies in the enhanced status of CRB notes themselves and the increasingly significant mission of the Central Reserve Bank, which issues them. Objectively speaking, however, the determinants of its value lie in domestic commodity prices and fluctuations in international exchange rates, and the two are often mutually causal. That is, the rise and fall of domestic commodity prices often lead to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and vice versa. Since this foreign exchange agreement stipulates that CRB notes are the sole trade currency for Central and Southern China with southern regions, and the exchange rate is fixed at 100 CRB notes equaling 18 Japanese yen, the positive impact it can have on domestic commodity prices is self-evident. It is hoped that the public's tendency to devalue the currency will shift as a result, and that the government's policy of maintaining the currency will be further strengthened.</p>
<h3>Spot Transactions to be Implemented After Stock Exchange's General Year-End Closing; Fee Rates to be Changed Weekly</h3>
<p>After the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was ordered to resume operations and exclusively auction Chinese merchant stocks, it was divided into morning and afternoon sessions each day. Initially, due to the resumption of trading, spot transactions with next-day delivery were temporarily the main focus. In accordance with the business rules and regulations, it is possible to conduct fixed-term and current-term trading. However, to prevent speculation and manipulation, current-term trading is temporarily the principle. Recently, in response to the requests of various brokers, although the next-day delivery system is good, the large volume of transactions makes settlement time-consuming, often leading to delays in completion. Therefore, it is proposed to implement spot transactions with immediate delivery, stipulating that purchase and sale settlements will be processed every Monday thereafter. It is said that this matter is being considered by the relevant authorities and may be implemented during the opening day following the Lunar New Year general closing period, on January 31, when the market resumes with a "red" trading day. In addition, the exchange's fee charged to each broker has been changed to 0.125%, while the fee charged by each broker to customers is said to be 0.5%.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Sponsor Second Savings Week</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank held its first Savings Week from September 15th to 22nd last year to encourage savings and absorb idle capital, offering prize-linked fixed deposits. The results were satisfactory, with the total amount absorbed exceeding the target. Now, to fulfill its original intention and meet the needs of the people, the bank has decided to hold its second Savings Week from the 17th to the 23rd of this month simultaneously in Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu. In Shanghai, the scope has been expanded to include the Shanghai Money Shop Trade Association, with all member shops jointly participating. The total amount to be absorbed has been increased to 10 million yuan, and the prize amount has also been doubled, adopting a double-prize system, with each grand prize winner receiving a bonus of 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Hovered Before Rising Again; Trend of Buying New Stocks and Shorting Old Stocks Remains Strong</h3>

<h3>Observations on the Purchase Amounts of Chinese and Japanese Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>Since the National Commercial Control General Association was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area, it has proceeded smoothly and achieved good results, which must be attributed to the deep understanding and support of the national policy by Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants. The purchase amounts of yarn and cloth as published in the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants: 92,103 bales of cotton yarn, 35,504 bales of gray cotton cloth (40 pieces per bale), 125,568 bales of processed cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants: 81,601 bales of cotton yarn, 75,865 bales of gray cotton cloth, 57,720 bales of processed cotton cloth.</p>
<p>The total number of bales of Chinese yarn and cloth is 253,175, while the Japanese total is 215,186, for a combined total of 468,361.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants is surveyed as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants: Yarn factories (Yarn Factory Association) 32, Yarn dealers (Yarn Dealer Association) approximately 800, Cloth factories (Cloth Factory Association) approximately 1,200, Cloth dealers (Cloth Dealer Association) approximately 2,600.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants: Yarn factories (Textile Association) 11, Trading firms (Cotton Industry Association) 66, Cloth factories (Industrial Association) approximately 30.</p>
<p>The Chinese total is approximately 4,600, while the Japanese total is approximately 107. Observing the above figures, I cannot help but have the following feelings:</p>
<p>It appears that Chinese merchants are applying to sell more yarn and cloth than Japanese merchants. However, after excluding enemy factories such as Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Lun Chang Silk Co., which are already under military administration (although the warehouse receipts are still held by Chinese merchants, it remains to be determined whether the goods meet the requirements upon actual inspection in the future, see page 33 of the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication), and after excluding the one-month reserve amount due to retailers and cloth factories and various exemptions from purchase, the actual amount of yarn and cloth purchased from Chinese merchants is at most equal to that of Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>Comparing 4,600 firms to 107 firms yields a ratio of approximately 43 to 1, but the amount of yarn and cloth sold by both sides is surprisingly similar. With the exception of the 32 yarn factories on the Chinese side, which are slightly larger in scope, it is evident that the rest are all small-capital operations. The dispersal and narrowness of China's industry and commerce are undeniable.</p>
<p>The Chinese side has more than twice the amount of processed cotton cloth compared to the Japanese side, but conversely, the amount of gray cotton cloth is less than half that of the Japanese side. This clearly shows that the Chinese merchants are not only small-capital operations but also have a large amount of mixed and fragmented inventory. Processed cotton cloth refers to dyed cloth, printed products, and the like, most of which are actual clothing needs and not valued by speculators. The amount available for military use is also minimal. Ultimately, due to excessive purchasing and storage by outsiders, it has led to the serious consequences faced by yarn and cloth merchants today.</p>
<p>Japanese textile companies are shifting yarn and cloth purchases to other industrial production or investing in other businesses (see the article "New Trends in the Japanese Textile Industry in China in the Future" on page 10 of the third issue of the Commercial Control Association's publication). However, the Chinese merchants are all small-capital operations, and the funds from the yarn and cloth purchases are fixed. Business has been suspended, and it is difficult to even maintain expenses. Where will the surplus come from to open up a new path?</p>
<p>Although Chinese and Japanese yarn and cloth merchants are both experiencing difficulties due to the purchase, Japanese residents in Shanghai are still able to obtain sufficient daily necessities and maintain their standard of living through rationing. Although the Chinese merchants also receive rations, the quantity is extremely small. Taking the most important rice and coal as examples, the amount of rations in a month is only enough for a few days, and the remaining amount must be obtained from the black market. Chinese yarn and cloth merchants use the payments received in installments for the purchased yarn and cloth at the official price to exchange for rice and coal on the black market, and the difference is immeasurable.</p>
<p>The value of yarn and cloth is hundreds of millions, and there are as many as 4,600 Chinese yarn and cloth merchants. How many hundreds of thousands of people depend on them for a living? Recently, although the Qing Shao Tuan (Youth Corps) has severely punished the three industries of opium, gambling, and dancing, there is still hope for a resurgence. However, the yarn and cloth merchants are on the verge of collapse, production has been suspended, a huge amount of capital is frozen for a long time, and most of the workers are unemployed. Some say that paying for yarn and cloth in one lump sum would cause inflation. There are many ways to tighten the currency supply. If the yarn and cloth merchants must be placed in a state of irretrievable ruin in order to tighten the currency supply, it would be akin to abandoning eating because of choking. I do not believe this is entirely credible. I sincerely hope that the wise authorities will devise other appropriate measures to rectify the situation. It is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Ambition (3)</p>
<p>But Masato became more focused on studying Judo. That gentle child was studying so enthusiastically that others couldn't understand it.</p>
<p>(Has Tani's physique become stronger…?), Mr. Oshima, who had come to the practice hall, watched Masato's techniques from afar, with his arms crossed, thinking.</p>
<p>His Judo skills weren't good, but he had an innate talent for making his body soft and accepting his opponent's strength. This was the essence of Judo. Masato, unaware of this truth, liked to practice with anyone he could easily strike.</p>
<p>While studying Judo, Masato became close to a classmate, Komori. Although not as close as his friend Jo O, his friendship with Komori was quite intimate. Komori's muscles were strong from a young age, and his personality differed from both Masato and Takao, belonging to a typical Kagoshima type - the Saigo type. He wasn't hung up on trivial matters and was strong-willed. Hearing of Takao's naval aspirations, he raised his dark face proudly: "My ambition is the army. I want to go to the Youth Academy, but my father told me to go to Tokyo. I'm enduring it for now at Second Middle School. In four years, you'll see! I'll pass the entrance exam for the Military Academy."</p>
<p>Masato envied his classmates who were planning their futures like that. Was he the only one who would remain alone in Kagoshima, working as a banker? -</p>
<p>At this time, the autumn colors of the Satsuma region were fading, and it was time to visit Myoenji Temple. The fourteenth day of the ninth lunar month was the day that Yoshihiro lost at Sekigahara. In commemoration of this day, the young people of the Satsuma region had walked the five-mile journey to Myoenji Temple in Teisho Ijuin since ancient times. The Satsuma people were competitive. This was deeply related to the customary phrase "Never forget Sekigahara". Translated into standard Japanese, it means "Don't forget this time." Just as the entire Japanese nation would never forget the Triple Intervention after the Sino-Japanese War, the Satsuma people would never forget the humiliation of Sekigahara.</p>
<p>But in recent years, the youth have become lazy, and there are even those who don't take the visit to Myoenji Temple seriously. It is truly regrettable. "On that day, Mr. Takeyama from Yamagata Prefecture told his students honestly. Even people from other places, if they come to Satsuma, will be infected with the Satsuma spirit."</p>
<p>The students of Second Middle School, led by the brass band, sang the marching song for the visit to Myoenji Temple, crossed Mizukamisaka, and went to pay their respects. By the time they returned to school, it was already dusk. However, the next morning, a student, limping, reported to Mr. Takeyama: "I went again last night."</p>
<p>Beneath the puffy eyes from lack of sleep, bright eyes were staring at the teacher.</p>
<p>Mr. Takeyama couldn't understand the meaning of those words at first, but soon he understood the truth. It turned out that after returning with everyone, that student had gone again alone. He had walked twenty li back and forth twice in one day and night. That was Komori, whom Masato liked even more from then on.</p>

<h3>Two Enthusiastic Individuals in Education and Poverty Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Gu Huanzhang, owner of Gongyi Leather Factory, initiated and founded a leather industry elementary school because he saw that many children of poor families in his hometown of Yangshupu were out of school. He used his former residence on Dinghai Road and Pingliang Road as the school building, and the school opened in March of last year. The start-up cost was about 100,000 yuan, and the annual operating expenses last year were about 60,000 yuan, most of which came from Mr. Gu's personal funds. Last year, all fees for students, including tuition and miscellaneous fees, were waived, and textbooks and school supplies were also completely donated. Now, with soaring prices making it difficult to continue, it is necessary to charge each student a tuition fee of 100 yuan in the next semester to show a limit. Mr. Gu not only cares about the school children in his hometown, but also benefits the elderly. In the past two years, he has given relief funds to poor and helpless elderly people in the Yangshupu area, totaling more than 10,000 yuan each year. His generosity and benevolence are truly rare. (Yang Jinxiong)</p>
<p>The owner of the Jia Lin Scholarship Fund is enthusiastic about education and social causes. This newspaper has mentioned it many times. The owner admires Zeng Wenzhenggong (Zeng Guofan) very much. He said: "I have benefited a lot from Zeng Wenzhenggong's family letters. Every time I read his talks about filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, trustworthiness, and how to treat people, I have been deeply moved. Life is like a dream, and if you want to be worthy of your conscience, there is no other way than filial piety, fraternity, loyalty, and trustworthiness. I was taught righteousness by my father and grandfather, and I have always treated others as myself in my life. Regardless of hard work and resentment, I only seek peace of mind, holding the purpose of 'not yielding to benevolence and acting bravely when seeing justice', without having to look back." (Bing Zhong)</p>
