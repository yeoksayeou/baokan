<h3 id="c1">助學金制度的意義 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>中國老早就有一句處世的格言：「各入自掃門前雪，休管他人瓦上霜」。這就是說，中國人除自己個人的事外，而對於他人的事，則總是漠不關心的。林語堂認爲中國人這種特性的由來，即「處於個人權利無法律保障的社會裏，不管閑事往往是明哲保身之道」。他還說過：「像英國人留心於傘一樣，中國人留心於不管閑事。這是因爲政治上的　化，往往對於單獨離鄉背井而稍微嘗試冒險的人，多少會帶來一種不祥的預兆。換言之，在中國不管閑事，是很有處世哲學上的高深價値」。這一中國人的特性，常然是由於該國在全世界上歷史最久的封建制度，所無形中養成的特性。所以我認爲如封建制度崩潰，則中國人的這一特性，也就隨着消逝。證明我這一論斷，請看辛亥革命以來，因爲沒有遵守「休管他人瓦上霜」的原則，以致喪失生命者不知凡幾。關心國家社會大事，比關心自己生命的人愈多，則國家社會就愈會高度的組織化，個人權利也就愈有保障。不久前，我在河南路橋的傍邊，會發現一個社會原理上有興趣的實例。我想任何人都曾注意得到，滿載柴爿或煤炭的車輛，路過那個橋時，就有一羣兒童悄悄地尾隨而來，手脚敏捷地抽出一根柴爿或搶取一塊煤炭，立刻就飛也似地四散逃掉。過一個辰光，他們的掠奪品一達到相當數目時，他們就把各自的掠奪品收集到一處，而年齡較大的兒童，就實行平均分配。我在靜安寺還會看見過搶落花生包的一個男孩子，把這包掠奪品交給大的孩子，而對自己的夥伴們實行平均分配。常然他們這樣作，決不是讀過什麼克魯泡特金（Kropotkin）著的「互助論」，而受到了感召；當然也決不是聽到墨子所說的「有餘力則相勞，有餘財則相分」的平等論，而受到了感化。這完全是由於他們的生活要求，而走上這樣的道德觀念。試想，他們經常徘徊於死亡綫的周圍，假如這批人堅持極端的個人主義，那末他們老早就成爲餓殍，而死於溝整了。因爲他們的收入是不固定的，假如他們不奉行有無相通的原則，以營共同生活，那末當他們一文不名的時候，豈不是要坐以待斃麼？他們很懂得，在自已得意的時候幫助他人，就是自己無辦法時的救命之道。由於生活上這種必要，就在他們這一羣人中間，自然而然地產生一個組縱。他們領會了只有這種組織，才是拯救他們出飢寒交迫火坑的最好制度。</p>
<p>每一個中國人，以自己現在所處的社會，和這羣小　三的社會比較一下的時候，就該知道應當多少模倣他們一些優點。如果說發財者仟其揮霍，飢寒者任其死亡的這種社會，就是文明社會，那末人們就會詛咒文明的。中國的愛國靑年，老早就不止一次地搖旗吶喊過：「中國這樣的社會，必須加以改造」。然而這批愛國靑年，一朝大權在握時，則立刻失掉前此的革命精神，只顧自己的昇官發財前進，而對社會問題則漠不關心。辛亥革命的歷史，竟不幸而襲承過去惡習的衣鉢。政治家仍然不關心於民衆生活，而民衆仍然不關心於政治情形。所以目前正當官廳的電梯因「節省電流」而停開的時期，以及一般家庭不用電燈而點油燈的時期，試觀南市的賭窟，却在耀目的電燈及輝煌的霓虹光下，繼續其「通宵營業」，而一般人反不以爲怪，（此之謂戰時電力節約，嗚呼！吾復何言！）假如在日本有這樣不公平的現象存在，一般人老早就會搗毀電力公司，而使之關門大吉了。在中國，這類不公平的社會現象，是到處可以看到，而不勝枚舉的。爲什麼在中國社會裏能存在這類不公平的現象呢？爲什麼中國人對於這類不公平的社會現象，還能如此忍受而不起而反抗呢？對於這一點的最大理由，我不能不特別指出一個事實：卽四萬萬中國人中，有百分之九十的人民，全是連自己的名姓都不會寫的一品大文盲。號稱四萬萬人民的中國，在戰前全國報紙的發行總效，只有二百萬份，尙不及日本或美國第一流雜誌一種的發行數目。於是，評論政治長短的大作，當然就只好由少數知識份子來包辦囉！就因爲這種關係，政治家就很容易發生輕視民意的心理。而縱有非難這種矛盾，而想對社會聊盡棉薄的供獻者，則立刻加以「思想過激」的罪名，而使之消形匿跡於人開。所以在中國這樣一個國家，知識份于關心社會問題，誠是生命攸關的事。如果中國的國民敎育愈普，則中國的這類變熊現象，就越發减少，這是不言而喻的定律吧！國民文化愈提高，則人民大衆間「公」的觀念，就愈益要成，同時也就明瞭，私人的利益，可能在某種國家組織當中受到最妥常的保隙。於是民衆就會放棄前此「不管閑事」的心理，而改變爲甘願爲國家犧牲身家生命的那種關心。民衆問養成這種國家觀念時，國家才有强盛的可能。眞不幸，今日中國人中所最缺乏者，是民衆的這種國家觀念。自從抗戰以來，國民在這一點上雖說有長足的進步，然而此起他國人民對政治的關心來說，實有相形見絀，小巫見大巫之感。自然誰都曉得，挽救中國民衆的這一缺陷，普遍實行國民敎育，就是當前的最大急務。雖然敎育如此重要，然而在今天的中國，誰都不肯過問者，却也是敎育事業。</p>
<p>某大官就任於江蘇省政府時，謀職而來者如過江之鯽，運動科長一職者，竟有三千人之多，但其中希望敎育機關者，從無一人。自然，這是由於敎育事業不能發大財，而只有辛苦所致。所以這類謀職者流，對於敎員拉黃包車，對於女學生背着米沿街叫賣，都毫不發生憐憫之心。甚而對於廣大的學生羣，因學費不足而輟學的這種悲慘現象，他們那批謀職者流，也表示着與我無關的神氣。所以眞正關心國家前途和民族命運的民衆，非自發地奮起，以挽救敎育事業於危殆不可。於是，具有社會事業意義，以及民衆運動　義的助學金制度，就應運而生。</p>
<p>救助貧苦學生，這決不是管他人的閑事。救助貧苦學生，完成其敎育，增多中國的知識份子，普及國民敎育，這就是使中國變爲近代化國家的一個方法。如中國不能踏入近代化國家的階段，則國民各自的私利和名譽，是絕對不能擺脫惡劣封建勢力的威脅的。以爲別人遭受任何厄運，全與我無涉，只要自己走運氣就好，然而在某個時期，自己木身就會遇見這種不幸的。客觀現實的中國社會，就是這種赤裸裸的實例。中國民衆，現在必須知道，對社會漠不關心的後果，將如何的危險。</p>
<p>「各人自掃門前雪，休管他人瓦上霜」這句格言，如稍加思索，就可以知道只適用在陰天。如天氣淸朗，太陽出現，就會把他人瓦上的霜瞬化而流下來，結果自已的門前也會泥濘的。所以說，單純掃除自己鬥前的雪是不够的，同時證明，這一格言在「靑天白日」普照之下的今天，是已經不合時了。（大魯譯）</p>

<h3 id="c3">東條首相　答覆致詞 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十一一日中央社電日衆院議員太田正考，於二十二日在衆院豫算總會席上提出質問兩項：　共榮圈建設方策，係以大東亞共同宣言爲基礎，未識其內容如何，　實現大東亞共同宜言之經濟繁榮原則展策如何當由東條自相答覆，並闡明大東亞宣言之根本精神，其大意如下：夫大東亞共同宣言，乃一政治攻勢，今日亟應使刻成爲積極化，蓋凡本爲係以一切物資與敵周旋，積極殲滅仇敵，外交方面，亦復如此。我政治施策，係以大東亞共同宣富爲基礎，亦應本以上方針予以推進，然余願國民對此勿發生誤解，良以大東亞共同宣言决非一種政略，　向於全世界閘明帝國之大理想，與大東亞各國各民族之共同大理想者，此在外人眼中或認爲係帝國之政略，然其眞意，决非政略，實已闡明大東亞國民自治之理想，此點望我國民勿予誤解，政府决本以上旨趣，推行政策。又政府已根據大東亞共同宣言之趣旨，對所有已成爲具體之事實，再仃處置，如日。滿兩國關係，對華北政第，日。泰之兩國關係，緬菲之獨立以及佔領地居民之參政等，均係本大東亞共同宣　之精神而實行者，此種儼然事實，世上某種人雖欲掩目不視而又不能，蓋帝國早已根據大東亞共同宣言，實行此種精神力量，今日更與大東亞各國家决定以此爲共同之思想，各國一致决意本此方針共同前進，確信今後將更努力實行。同時，在最大之政治手段以及思想方面各國亦將整齊步調，共同前進。其次則爲明確戰爭目的貢獻之必要，帝國戰爭目的，極爲明確，即在宣戰語毒總已有明確指示，我一億國民對之均極理解，戰爭旣以精神爲中心，則國段必須於此明確之戰爭目的下，在國內一切施策上充分發揚戰意，實屬重要，政府對此，已利用各種機會，發揮其全能力，而要望國民之奮起。關於今後大東亞建設或將以經濟　設爲主體而推進，蓋大東亞建設係以經濟建設爲主旨，余認爲此點與獨立親善之政治原則亦符，今尤爲車要，必須注意者，乃爲大東亞共同宣言所示之五項目也，因此五項目皆以穴言中之序言爲前題者，即無論何時，大東亞各國應始終提携，完成大東亞戰爭及自美·英之桎桔中解放大東亞，而完成其自存自衛，亦必須很據此種原則。建設大東亞，換言之，即所謂前提者，乃爲大東亞各國互相提携，完成　爭，大東亞各國互相提攜，自美·英之桎梏中解放大東亞，再謀自存自衛，以此種精神爲基礎而行動者也。無論經濟建設，抑或其他一切原則，均以大東亞共同宣言爲中心，此爲吾人所應銘記也，世人對此五項原則，往往作斷章取義之解釋，余適才所言者，願吾國民對於此點切勿誤解。</p>

<p>東亞民族存亡關頭</p>
<p>日本與中國提携協力，保持東亞之安定，以圖繁榮，但彼等視東亞之復興，即彼等之退却，故彼等在過去，即利用日本抑制中國阻止中國之發展，迨後見日本國勢强大，彼等之政策即又改變，欲牽絆中國以控制日本，此即東亞混亂之重要背景，此即彼等之傳統分割支配政策也。觀美總統最近之演說，實企圖除去日本，故此次戰爭，即日本爭取存亡之防衛鬥爭也。設吾人半途挫折，則不僅日本之存亡永被否認，即東亞亦必失去自主獨立之機會，故此次戰爭在軸心諸國為自存自衛之戰爭，東亞洲則為自主獨立之戰學也。日本具有三千年之悠久光輝歷史，現以世界之大國，從事於「解放亞洲復與東亞」之傽業，東亞各國各民族互相協力，斷然摧破英美之無道企圖。再者此次　爭，正爲世界之大變動，英國為維持其世界帝國之地位乃向德國挑戰，因此引起此戰爭，後由德蘇戰起，其情勢即愈形深刻，此觀於德黑藺會議以後之世界情勞，已有充分之反映。又當大東亞戰爭勃發以後，解放亞洲復興東亞之重大意義，已爲極明確之事實，亞洲今已非英美之殖民地或半殖民地，欲救援亞洲唯有亞洲人，英美之支配勢力一日殘存，即難期東亞之安定，禍亂將、永久不絕，故英美殘勢切斷以後，東亞始可恢復其本來面目。</p>

<p>中日兩國經過幾多之糾紛，今兩國之關係，已確立永久安定之基礎，並將外來之支配勢力澈底剷除。自中國參戰，中日兩國確定基本關係以迄今日，爲時僅年餘，而日本政策已積極推　。去年十月兩國間締結同盟條約，兩國國交永遠之前途業巳明確，根本友好關係，於茲確固不移，現在中國內部已可確立　全之和平狀態，日本决努力貫澈其旣定政策，益使其進展。此後隨戰爭之進行，經濟問題等或將這逢幾多因難，要屬當然，兩國應相互提携，抱定克服任何難關之决心而進行之。滿洲國與日本一心一德作絕大之協力，是誠日本所極感謝者，又泰國乃東亞有力之一國，自開戰以來，即與日本訂立同盟關係，站在共同戰綫，爲東亞復興而盡極大之努力，誠不勝欣慰，東亞諸國代表曁印度臨時政府主席，曾於去年十一月初旬，相會於東京，發表各國共同政策之大東亞宣言，闡明建設東亞之理念與世界和平基礎之大方針。按大東亞宣言所表明之各項原則，無非為解放東亞保衛東亞復興東亞，並進與世界各國提携，期　極貢獻於確立世界恒久和平，此等原則於戰時下固有各種不便，但關係各國之眞誠協力，已於積極實現中。</p>
<p>對蘇維持友好關係</p>
<p>現東亞大地之復興氣運民族興起，緬甸及菲律賓業已獲得光榮之獨立，以此新興之意義，頁獻於世界之進展，實行大東亞宣誓之精神。又印度多年期望之獨立，亦因自田印度臨時政府之成立而奠定基礎，此復興東亞解放亞洲之目標，實給與吾人以貫澈勝利之自信力。日本政府所抱對外政策，在於國際間普遍發展友好善隣關係，大東亞宣言原則第五項所謂「與萬邦敦篤交誼，撤廢人種的差別，普遍溝通文化，進而開放資源，以貢獻於世界之進展」之趣旨，亦即在此世界共存共榮之觀念，非在關閉而在開放。非爲排他而在協力。蓋確信推進此國際親和政策，即係救濟世界禂亂及破壞，乃建設之大道也。日本依據上項方針，尤銳意增進與隣邦諸國之相互親善關係，更進而與世界各地普遍以同樣之方針處之。觀於現在與日本保持中立關係之遠近諸國，將避免戰禍之擴大，自勿庸言，且益將努力敦篤彼此交誼。就中日蘇兩國之關係，雖因大東亞戰爭勃發，或歟洲戰爭之進展，不僅不受何等影響，且益將堅強維持彼此間之中立關係，敵人英美今日屢次宣傳總攻擊，對歐亞兩洲之軸心國堅陣採取攻勢，太平洋方面之反擊情况亦逐日熾烈，蓋本年爲决定世界戰局大勢之實大時期也，故余决盡棉薄，仰承上意，盡最善之努力，以處理外政也。</p>

<h3 id="c23">誰能安渡年關 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>去年十二月三十一日爲三十二年度銀錢各業總結束期，各業均得安渡年關；明日爲農曆大除夕，銀錢各業亦均開始辦理總結束，聞因一年來物價之飛漲，各業多獲厚利，亦得安渡年關；眞的，自銀錢各業言：「我不能安渡年關，誰能安渡年關？」可是，自人民公衆言：「我們大衆襄面能够安渡年關者，究有幾多人？」這句話不言則已，言之殊用慨然，因爲一年來人民生活之不能安定，其直接原因即由於一切囤積投機營業之刺激物價狂漲，漲到農曆年關，已使平民階級感覺絕對沒有購買的力量；同時，爲勉强渡過其最低生活水準的農曆年關，則惟有出於典質，變賣，吿貸，甚至乞憐的一途，安渡年關，從何說起？</p>
<p>所以，今後我們金融界的責任是十二分重大的。我們以前說過，從通貨金融力面來限制物偎之被擾亂，終不失爲有效的一個物價政策；日昨周財政部長發表談話，說過「舊曆年過後，或不免有囤積現象，刺激物價，希望各金融機關，愼重放款，務使放出之款，用於生產事業，旣可安定物價，又可促進生產。」這是今後金融界所富奉為準　的，庶幾明年今日，人人都可以安渡年關。增加生產爲工作重點</p>

<p>油鑒醬醋為晋人調味要品，其中尤以食臨爲最，食品中如無鹹味，則不能引起食慾：人體中如缺乏鑒質，則失去健康，故其重要性實不減於米。自當局規定食鹽限價每市斤為一元七角後，市民因無處可購，成向黑市添購。又因鑒價昂貴，連帶刺激醫油醤菜及鹹菜鹹蛋海味鹹魚等小菜價格步漲不已，增加市民負祖，貽害民生匪淺。</p>

<p>電車是都市的交通要具，盡人皆知，最近因石炭來源的不暢，影響到電力的供給量減少，所以電車公司不得不減少車輛和短縮行駛時間。電車乘客的擁擠，和乘客乘降時之漫無秩序，誰都覺得乘車的困難，發生無限苦惱。鄙人新由隣邦日本來滬，關於彼邦電車改善辦法，值得介紹國人，貢獻電車公司為參考之資料。</p>
<p>到過日本遊歷的人們，誰都不會忘記日本交通事業發達的印象，在各大都市都有電車行駛，以利市民交通，近來亦因都市人口的膨脹，和電力的限制，原有電車便感不够，電車公司為了要保持電車爲市民服務的唯一原則，及適合目前環境的限制，把電車箱內的兩旁座位，拆除一面，以便收容較多數的乘客。剩下的一面座位，專為老幼男女和戰傷的勇士們而設，自從改了這個辦法，擁擠的情形，大為和緩。市民都感到非常滿意，電車公司亦收穫相當良好的成績。鄙見上海的軍車，不妨仿法隣邦，略加改善，縱無絕大效騐，但較之現狀，必定好些，折除車箱座位的工程，非常輕鬆，對於電車公司旣已省力而又增加乘車人數，亦即增加公司的收入，可謂一舉兩得了。（　啓）</p>

<p>眞人從軍事參觀團歸來後，剩下的假期，是在天保山海　渡着的。不久新學期開始的時候，精神是異常的興奮着，而肉體却感覺一種奇妙地渡倦。為克復這種現象，猛烈的練習柔這，回到家裹，母親很吃第地說：「你在發熱了吧。」眞人通紅着臉，瞪着光亮的眼睛。「不！」雖然眞人這樣地否認着，但是强使他用溫度表一量，果然超過了三十八度。</p>
<p>眞人當時就臥倒在病牀上了。醫生的診斷，據說是有傷寒病的微兆。兩三日後，昇到四十度以上，熱的性質，巳經完全證實了是傷寒病。</p>
<p>他母親特別地掛心着，是不待言的。主要是松枝負看護之任，但是店裹稍有空暇的時候，母親就要坐在枕邊的。「為什麼得了這樣可怕的病症啊……」</p>
<p>他母親的嘆息。也是有原因的。因為家中從來沒有人患過傳染病。眞人在軍事參觀團旅行期問，　寒冒署，飲食不調，必是病因，病蘭的潛伏期，須要兩三個星期，正和旅行期間相符合。</p>
<p>但是他年靑力壯，自然較普通人是富於恢復力的，過了兩星期，便回到了平常的熱度。以後又聲養了一星期。</p>
<p>傷寒病的恢復期，是要使人食慾大增的，但是眞人對這一點，是堅强地自制着。從幼年時代以來的好勝心，在這時也發生了效果。只是這無聊的情緒，是最難堪的。隆夫們，時常來探病，但是他母親恐怕別人被傳染了，听以都謝絕了他們的會面，到了靜養期，松枝·加代·也不常到他的枕邊來了。眞人只好以天棚板為對手，作種種地談話，和作種種地想念。</p>
<p>有一天沒想到四吉兄帶着點心到病室來了「你實在是無聊罷……這樣菓子可以用點哪。」</p>
<p>很親切地哥哥，在送東西的歸途，買來了這點心。</p>
<p>眞人的內心是喜歡得不得了。突然他感到有將這深藏在胸中的宿望，對哥哥發表出來的必要。</p>
<p>「哥哥，我想考海軍兵學校，你看怎樣？」病後疲倦的聲曾，小聲地說。四吉兄忽然笑容滿面地：</p>
<p>「那狠好……我是在鹿兒島商業中途輟學的，很希望你能到上級的學校去……。好，我給你向母親說說看。」</p>
<p>「謝謝您。」眞人的眼眶裘淚珠盈盈欲墜</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Significance of the Scholarship System <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>There is an old Chinese saying, "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't bother about the frost on his neighbor's roof." This means that Chinese people are generally indifferent to the affairs of others, caring only about their own. Lin Yutang believed that this characteristic of the Chinese stemmed from "living in a society where individual rights are not legally protected, and minding one's own business is often the best way to protect oneself." He also said, "Like Englishmen are mindful of their umbrellas, Chinese are mindful of not interfering in other people's business. This is because political changes often bring ominous signs to those who venture out alone. In other words, in China, minding one's own business has profound philosophical value." This characteristic of the Chinese people is naturally fostered by the country's long-standing feudal system. Therefore, I believe that if the feudal system collapses, this characteristic of the Chinese people will also disappear. To prove my point, since the Xinhai Revolution, countless people have lost their lives because they did not adhere to the principle of "not bothering about the frost on their neighbor's roof." The more people care about national and social affairs more than their own lives, the more highly organized the country and society will be, and the more guaranteed individual rights will be. Not long ago, I discovered an interesting example of a social principle near the bridge on Henan Road. I think everyone has noticed that when carts loaded with firewood or coal pass by that bridge, a group of children quietly follow, deftly snatching a piece of firewood or coal, and then scattering in all directions. After a while, when their loot reaches a considerable amount, they collect their respective spoils together, and the older children carry out an equal distribution. I also saw a boy in Jing'an Temple who snatched a bag of peanuts, handing the loot over to the older children, who then distributed it equally among their companions. Of course, they are not doing this because they have read Kropotkin's "Mutual Aid" and were inspired; nor are they doing it because they heard Mozi's saying, "Those with surplus strength should labor for others, and those with surplus wealth should share with others," and were influenced. This is entirely due to their life requirements leading them to such a moral concept. Imagine, they often hover around the edge of death. If these people insisted on extreme individualism, they would have long become starving corpses and died in ditches. Because their income is unstable, if they do not practice the principle of sharing what they have to maintain a common life, then when they are penniless, wouldn't they be sitting ducks? They understand very well that helping others when they are successful is the way to save their own lives when they are in trouble. Due to this necessity in life, a group organization naturally arises among them. They understand that only this kind of organization is the best system to save them from the pit of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>When every Chinese person compares their current society with the society of these young beggars, they should know how much they should emulate some of their advantages. If a society where the rich are allowed to squander their wealth and the hungry are left to die is called a civilized society, then people will curse civilization. Patriotic Chinese youth have long shouted more than once, "Chinese society must be transformed." However, once these patriotic youths gain power, they immediately lose their previous revolutionary spirit, only caring about their own promotion and wealth, and becoming indifferent to social problems. The history of the Xinhai Revolution has unfortunately inherited the bad habits of the past. Politicians still do not care about the lives of the people, and the people still do not care about the political situation. Therefore, at a time when the elevators in government offices are stopped due to "saving electricity," and ordinary families are using oil lamps instead of electric lights, look at the gambling dens in Nanshi, which continue their "all-night business" under dazzling electric lights and brilliant neon lights, and people do not find it strange. (This is called wartime electricity saving, alas! What else can I say!) If such unfair phenomena existed in Japan, people would have long destroyed the power company and forced it to close down. In China, these kinds of unfair social phenomena can be seen everywhere and are too numerous to mention. Why can these kinds of unfair phenomena exist in Chinese society? Why can the Chinese people still endure these kinds of unfair social phenomena without rising up and resisting? For this, I must especially point out one major reason: that 90% of the 400 million Chinese people are illiterate, unable to even write their own names. In China, which is said to have 400 million people, the total circulation of newspapers nationwide before the war was only 2 million copies, which is less than the circulation of a top-tier magazine in Japan or the United States. Therefore, major works commenting on political affairs can only be handled by a small number of intellectuals. Because of this relationship, politicians easily develop a mentality of despising public opinion. And even those who criticize this contradiction and want to contribute to society are immediately labeled with the crime of "radical thinking" and made to disappear from public view. Therefore, in a country like China, it is a matter of life and death for intellectuals to care about social problems. If national education in China becomes more widespread, then these kinds of abnormal phenomena will decrease even more. This is an self-evident rule! The higher the national culture, the more important the concept of "public" among the people will become. At the same time, it will also become clear that personal interests can be best protected in a certain national organization. As a result, the people will abandon their previous mentality of "minding their own business" and change to a willingness to sacrifice their lives for the country. When the people develop this kind of national concept, the country will have the possibility of becoming strong. Unfortunately, what is most lacking among the Chinese people today is this national concept. Although the people have made significant progress in this regard since the Anti-Japanese War, compared with the concern for politics among the people of other countries, there is still a sense of inferiority, like a small witch seeing a great one. Naturally, everyone knows that the most urgent task at present is to universally implement national education in order to remedy this shortcoming of the Chinese people. Although education is so important, in today's China, it is the education sector that no one is willing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>When a high-ranking official took office in the Jiangsu Provincial Government, those seeking positions were like carp crossing the river. There were as many as three thousand people vying for the position of section chief, but not a single one of them hoped to work in the education sector. Naturally, this is because the education sector cannot make a fortune, and only involves hard work. Therefore, these job seekers have no pity for teachers pulling rickshaws or female students selling rice on the streets. Moreover, they show an attitude of indifference to the tragic phenomenon of a large number of students dropping out of school due to insufficient tuition. Therefore, the people who truly care about the future of the country and the fate of the nation must spontaneously rise up to save the education sector from danger. As a result, the scholarship system, which has the significance of social undertaking and the significance of popular movement, came into being.</p>
<p>Helping poor students is definitely not minding other people's business. Helping poor students complete their education, increasing the number of intellectuals in China, and popularizing national education is a way to transform China into a modern country. If China cannot enter the stage of a modern country, then the private interests and reputations of the people will absolutely not be able to escape the threat of evil feudal forces. Thinking that any misfortune suffered by others has nothing to do with me, as long as I am lucky, is incorrect because at some point, misfortune will befall oneself. The objective reality of Chinese society is a naked example of this. The Chinese people must now know how dangerous the consequences of indifference to society will be.</p>
<p>The saying "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't bother about the frost on his neighbor's roof" can be applied on cloudy days, but if you think about it further, you can see that it only applies on cloudy days. If the weather is clear and the sun appears, it will instantly melt the frost on the neighbor's roof and flow down, resulting in mud in front of your own door. Therefore, simply sweeping the snow in front of one's own door is not enough. At the same time, this proverb is no longer suitable in today's world under the "Blue Sky with a White Sun." (Translated by Da Lu)</p>

<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) — Both the Japanese House of Peers and the House of Representatives held plenary sessions on the 20th to submit various legal bills proposed by the government to committees for deliberation. Meanwhile, the House of Peers Committee and the House of Representatives held a general budget meeting for concrete deliberation. The House of Peers held a plenary session at 10:05 AM and submitted seven bills, including the Laborer's Pension Amendment Bill, to committees for deliberation. The House of Peers advanced the deliberation of a total of fourteen legal bills and then adjourned at 10:35 AM after submitting them to committees for deliberation. The House of Representatives also held a plenary session at 1:00 PM and submitted various tax-related bills and the eighteen bills whose deliberation was advanced by the House of Representatives, to committees for deliberation. In addition, the Budget Committee opened at 10:11 AM. Mr. Ota Masataka raised questions regarding national policy, and then Prime Minister Tojo and cabinet ministers responded, focusing on issues such as building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere through political offensives, strengthening military power, stabilizing people's lives, and promoting war administration. After a heated debate, the plenary session resumed in the afternoon and held a closed session. This decisive parliament has already achieved great results since the close cooperation meetings between the government and the parliament resumed two days ago.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) — The Japanese House of Peers held a plenary session on the morning of the 22nd at 10:05 AM. They sequentially discussed the North China Development Co., Ltd. Law and the Central China Promotion Co., Ltd. Amended Law, as well as eight other bills proposed by the government. After the responsible ministers explained the reasons for the proposals, they were submitted to various special committees for review. The meeting adjourned at 10:35 AM.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Prime Minister Tojo's Response <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) — Mr. Ota Masataka, a member of the Japanese House of Representatives, raised two questions at the General Budget Committee session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd: 1. What is the content of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere construction plan, which is based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration? 2. What is the policy for realizing the economic prosperity principle of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration? Prime Minister Tojo responded personally and elaborated on the fundamental spirit of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is a political offensive. Today, we must make it more active. All efforts must be made to deal with the enemy with all resources and actively eliminate the enemy. The same applies to diplomacy. Our political policies are based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and should be promoted according to the above guidelines. However, I hope that the people will not misunderstand this because the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is definitely not a political strategy. It is to clarify to the world the great ideals of the Empire and the common ideals of the various countries and nations of Greater East Asia. Outsiders may think that it is the Empire's political strategy, but its true meaning is definitely not a political strategy. It has clarified the ideal of autonomy for the people of Greater East Asia. I hope that our people will not misunderstand this. The government is determined to promote policies based on the above purpose. In addition, the government has taken actions based on the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration for all the concrete facts that have been realized. For example, the relationship between Japan and Manchuria, the policy towards North China, the relationship between Japan and Thailand, the independence of Burma and the Philippines, and the political participation of residents in the occupied territories are all implemented in the spirit of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Although some people in the world want to close their eyes and not see these obvious facts, they cannot. The Empire has long been implementing this spiritual force based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Today, it is determined with various countries in Greater East Asia to take this as a common idea, and all countries are unanimously determined to move forward together according to this policy. It is certain that they will work harder to implement it in the future. At the same time, in terms of the greatest political means and ideology, the countries will also align their steps and move forward together. Secondly, it is necessary to contribute to clarifying the purpose of the war. The purpose of the Empire's war is very clear. There were clear instructions in the declaration of war. 100 million of our people fully understand it. Since the war is centered on spirit, it is important to fully promote the will to fight in all domestic policies under this clear war goal. The government has been using various opportunities to exert its full strength on this and hopes for the people's upsurge. In the future, the construction of Greater East Asia may be promoted mainly through economic construction. The construction of Greater East Asia is based on economic construction. I think this is also in line with the political principles of independence and friendship. What is even more important now is to pay attention to the five items shown in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The preface in the declaration prefaces all five items, that is, at any time, the countries of Greater East Asia should always cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War and liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain, and complete its self-preservation and self-defense, and must follow this principle. To construct Greater East Asia, in other words, the so-called prerequisite is that the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate with each other to complete the war, and liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of the United States and Britain to seek self-preservation and self-defense. They act based on this spirit. Regardless of economic construction or any other principle, it is centered on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This is what we should keep in mind. People often interpret these five principles out of context. I just said that, I hope that our people will not misunderstand this.</p>

Recently, it has been found that there are inmates who are reported to be held in prisons and detention centers, and there are delays in the execution procedures, and there are cases where the sentences have expired but they have not been released, which is very inappropriate. In order to protect the interests of convicts, prosecutors should strive for speed in handling execution matters, and prison directors should also pay attention to them at all times. If the procedures are not yet complete, they should be remedied immediately. In the future, if such cases are found, the relevant prosecutors will be held accountable.

<h3 id="e7">The Main Points of Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Diplomatic Speech (Continued and Completed) <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The Critical Moment for the Survival of East Asian Nations</p>
<p>Japan is cooperating with China to maintain stability in East Asia and to promote prosperity. However, they see the restoration of East Asia as their retreat. Therefore, in the past, they used Japan to restrain China and prevent China's development. Later, seeing that Japan's national power was strong, their policy changed again. They wanted to tie China to control Japan. This is an important background to the chaos in East Asia. This is their traditional policy of division and domination. Looking at the recent speech of the US President, he is trying to eliminate Japan. Therefore, this war is Japan's defensive struggle for survival. If we suffer a setback halfway, not only will Japan's survival be permanently denied, but East Asia will also lose the opportunity for autonomy and independence. Therefore, this war is a war for self-preservation and self-defense for the Axis powers, and it is a war for autonomy and independence for East Asia. Japan has a long and glorious history of three thousand years. Now, as a great power in the world, it is engaged in the task of "liberating Asia and restoring East Asia." All countries and nations in East Asia should cooperate with each other to resolutely destroy the unreasonable attempts of Britain and the United States. Furthermore, this war is a major change in the world. Britain challenged Germany to maintain its position as a world empire, which caused this war. Later, the German-Soviet war broke out, and the situation became more serious. This is fully reflected in the world situation after the Tehran Conference. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the great significance of liberating Asia and restoring East Asia has become a very clear fact. Asia is no longer a colony or semi-colony of Britain and the United States. Only Asians can save Asia. As long as the dominance of Britain and the United States remains, it will be difficult to expect stability in East Asia, and disasters will never end. Therefore, only after cutting off the remaining forces of Britain and the United States can East Asia restore its original appearance.</p>
<p>Efforts to Implement Established Policies</p>
<p>After many disputes between China and Japan, the relationship between the two countries has now established a foundation for permanent stability, and foreign domination will be completely eliminated. From the participation of China in the war, the basic relationship between China and Japan has been established to this day, it has only been a little over a year, and Japan's policies have been actively promoted. In October of last year, a treaty of alliance was concluded between the two countries, and the future of the relations between the two countries was clarified forever. The fundamental friendly relations have been firmly established here. Now, a state of complete peace can be established inside China. Japan is determined to strive to implement its established policies and make them progress further. In the future, as the war progresses, there will naturally be some difficulties in economic problems, etc. The two countries should cooperate with each other and be determined to overcome any difficulties and proceed. Manchuria and Japan are working together with one heart and one mind, which Japan greatly appreciates. Thailand is one of the powerful countries in East Asia. Since the beginning of the war, it has concluded a treaty of alliance with Japan and stood on the common front, making great efforts for the restoration of East Asia. I am very pleased. Representatives of East Asian countries and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India met in Tokyo in early November last year and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration of common policies of various countries, clarifying the concept of building East Asia and the general policy of the foundation of world peace. The various principles stated in the Greater East Asia Declaration are nothing more than to liberate East Asia, defend East Asia, restore East Asia, and cooperate with various countries in the world to make the ultimate contribution to establishing lasting world peace. Although these principles have various inconveniences during wartime, the sincere cooperation between the countries concerned is being actively realized.</p>
<p>Maintain Friendly Relations with the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Now the revitalization of the East Asian land and the rise of the nation, Myanmar and the Philippines have already gained glorious independence, using this emerging significance to dedicate themselves to the progress of the world and implement the spirit of the Greater East Asia Oath. In addition, the independence that India has been expecting for many years has also been laid the foundation due to the establishment of the provisional government of India. This goal of revitalizing East Asia and liberating Asia gives us the confidence to carry out the victory. The foreign policy held by the Japanese government lies in the universal development of friendly and good-neighborly relations between countries. The fifth item of the Greater East Asia Declaration, the principle of "establishing cordial relations with all nations, abolishing racial discrimination, universally communicating culture, and opening up resources to contribute to the progress of the world," also lies in this concept of coexistence and co-prosperity in the world, which is not in closing but in opening. It is not for exclusion but for cooperation. It is firmly believed that promoting this international reconciliation policy is the main road to saving the world from chaos and destruction, and is the road to construction. Based on the above policy, Japan is particularly determined to increase mutual friendly relations with neighboring countries, and further treat all parts of the world with the same policy. Looking at the countries near and far that maintain neutral relations with Japan now, it goes without saying that they will avoid the expansion of the war, and they will also strive to promote their friendship with each other. As for the relationship between China, Japan and the Soviet Union, even if the Greater East Asia War breaks out or the European War progresses, not only will it not be affected in any way, but it will further strengthen the neutral relations between each other. The enemy Britain and the United States are repeatedly promoting total attacks today, taking an offensive against the Axis powers in Europe and Asia, and the counterattack in the Pacific is becoming more and more intense. This year is a major period to determine the overall situation of the world war, so I am determined to use all my efforts and, with the support of the superiors, to do my best to handle foreign affairs.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the National Government joined the war, the Japanese authorities in the Allied states have gradually transferred British and American enemy property in Central China to the management of our government. The first transfer took place on March 29th of last year, with 26 enemy properties related to enterprises and 84 enemy properties related to cultural affairs being transferred. The second transfer of enemy property took place on October 20th of the same year, with 21 enemy properties related to enterprises and 31 enemy properties related to cultural affairs being transferred. It is now learned that the third transfer of British and American enemy property in Central China, involving 30 category two key enterprises, was held yesterday (22nd) at 2:00 PM at the Astor House Hotel in Shanghai. Representatives from both the Chinese and Japanese governments attended, including Zhang Sumin, director of the Shanghai Office of the New Enemy Property Management Committee on the Chinese side, and Minister Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Staff Officer Inoue of the Japanese Army, Staff Officer Fukuyama, Staff Officer Kawao of the Navy, Staff Officer Teshima, and the managers entrusted with the management of the new enemy property on the Japanese side. After the ceremony, Minister Tajiri, the Japanese representative, gave a speech, followed by a thank-you speech by Zhang Sumin, the Chinese government representative. After the transfer procedures were completed, the managers entrusted with the management of the new enemy property held a dismissal ceremony, and Mitsui Suematsu, chairman of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, gave a reply on behalf of the managers. The transfer ceremony was completed at around 3:00 PM. The 30 enterprises transferred this time include key enemy properties such as docks, factories, warehouses, hotels, department stores, and ranches. It is planned that a portion of the returned enemy property will be jointly operated by China and Japan. The speeches of Minister Tajiri and Director Zhang Sumin are recorded below:</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Tajiri</p>
<p>Minister Tajiri said in his speech: The Japanese government has previously stated to the National Government that it would transfer enemy property in China. Based on this statement, it has been gradually transferring the enemy property that has been prepared. Today, the preparations for the transfer of 30 enterprise-related items in the second transfer of enemy property have been completed. I have been entrusted by the supreme commanders of the Army and Navy in Shanghai to transfer them to the National Government in accordance with the detailed list attached separately. Therefore, I am greatly honored to be able to hand over this enemy property to your government representative in my capacity as the representative of the Japanese government. Since the National Government joined the war on January 9th of last year, China and Japan have been jointly prosecuting the Greater East Asia War in close cooperation. Our government sincerely hopes that your government and the Chinese people will fully utilize this transferred enemy property as an effective means to prosecute the Greater East Asia War. We expect your government to fully cooperate and make great use of this transferred enemy property, in order to live up to the expectations of the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Thank-You Speech by Zhang Sumin</p>
<p>Zhang Sumin, Director of the Shanghai Office of the New Enemy Property Management Committee, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the National Government: Today, I am deeply honored to receive 30 enemy properties in the enterprise sector transferred by the allied authorities on behalf of my government. I would like to express my special thanks to the allied government, the Shanghai Army and Navy, and the Shanghai Embassy. This is the third time I have received enemy property on behalf of the Chinese government. The management methods of the many pieces of enemy property received in the previous two transfers have been closely coordinated with the Allied Embassy and the Allied Enemy Property Management Committee at all times, and I am very grateful for their support. I will also discuss the management methods for the 30 pieces received today with the Allied side. As for the important issue at hand, which is to increase production, Chairman Wang has stated that this year is the "Year of Increased Production." I have been ordered to manage enemy property and have always adhered to the principle of increasing production. For factories that have already started operations, I will ensure that they continue to operate. For factories that have stopped operations, I will also find ways to resume operations. This is something that I can report to everyone with satisfaction. Finally, on behalf of my government, I would like to thank the Allied Army and Navy bureaus and the Allied Embassy.</p>

<p>At precisely 10:30 AM, the simple but solemn naming ceremony for the Huifeng Ship began. Naval Chief Ren, accompanied by Director Ye and officials from allied countries, boarded the Huifeng survey ship amid the strains of military music. Director Ye first gave a speech at the stern of the ship, explaining in detail the history and equipment of the Huifeng Ship. This was followed by the flag-raising ceremony, which lasted 27 seconds. Naval Chief Ren accompanied the guests on a tour of all the equipment inside the ship. After leaving the ship and landing, the entire group was photographed. Naval Chief Ren then hosted a tea party for the officials and guests present. During the tea party, Naval Chief Ren and the Chief of Staff of the Allied Japanese Fleet stationed in China gave speeches in succession. The tea party concluded with refreshments.</p>
<p>Director Ye's Speech</p>
<p>The naming ceremony for the Huifeng survey ship has been completed. Before inviting you to visit the ship, I would like to briefly explain the ship's main features and other details. This ship was formerly named Haiyan and served as a coastal patrol vessel for the Customs Service. During the current Greater East Asia War, it was captured by the Japanese Navy. With the kind intention of the Allied Navy, it has been loaned to the Chinese Navy at no cost and assigned to the Hydrographic Survey Bureau for service as a survey ship. The main features of the ship are as follows: Displacement: 505 tons. Length: 41.9 meters. Normal Draft: 2.27 meters. Engine: Triple expansion engine, two boilers. Speed: Approximately 11 knots. Cruising Range: 1,200 nautical miles at cruising speed. Crew: Projected 8 officers, 48 non-commissioned officers and enlisted men, totaling 56 men. Armament: Cannon and radio. Other major weapons, as well as echo sounders and radio acoustic ranging equipment, and other cutting-edge weapons required for a survey ship, have not yet been completed. They will be installed successively in the future, and efforts will be made to gradually improve surveying skills in order to cooperate with the Japanese Navy Routing Department without any regrets. However, the guidance and assistance of the Japanese Navy and our military leaders are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>The deadline for registration for the application forms for the sixth session of student aid from this newspaper closed yesterday, with a total of over 10,000 forms received. A roster is currently being prepared for the selection process. Although this session of aid has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, it is still short of the target by a significant amount of 1.1 million yuan. Time is running out, and we urgently hope that supporters will contribute generously. With the Lunar New Year approaching, all sectors cannot avoid the customary banquets and gift-giving. This exchange of gifts is purely wasteful consumption. We hope that gentlemen will, with a thought of kindness, convert the gifts into cash and donate them to the student aid fund in the name of the giver.</p>
<p>Qian and Liang Generously Donate Large Sums</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Qian, Deputy Governor of the Central Reserve Bank, sent 50,000 yuan in national currency to donate to student aid, showing deep respect for the concern for the poor. Mr. Ye Xuesong, father, forwarded a letter from Mr. Liang Zhi, which stated: "For my 50th birthday, I have received generous gifts from relatives and friends. I dare not celebrate during these difficult times. I have specially set aside 300,000 yuan in national currency from the feast expenses to help public welfare. I am donating 50,000 yuan to the Shen Bao student aid fund, and the rest will be used for other charitable activities." Mr. Liang's enthusiasm for public welfare and his frugal generosity are truly admirable. Mr. Chen Junren of Yao Ji Paper Company specially set aside 10,000 yuan from the New Year's Eve dinner expenses and sent it to the Shen Xin two newspapers' student aid funds. Mr. Li Shuwen is a factory foreman in a tannery. Feeling the pain of regret for losing his opportunity to study in his youth, he specially donated 1,000 yuan of the year-end bonus given by the factory to the student aid fund. The enthusiasm of all sectors for helping the unschooled is commendable.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the payment for purchasing yarn and cloth, the person in charge of the Commerce and Trade Control Committee stated: "Merchants who have sold yarn and cloth and are due to receive payment should first obtain an exchange certificate from the Cotton Industry Management Office of this Committee and then present the certificate to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank to exchange for security deposits and fixed-term deposit certificates. This yarn and cloth payment work is complex and time-consuming to calculate. A portion of the merchants has already received their payments in succession, while the rest are still in the process of receiving them. Director Tang has repeatedly ordered the Cotton Management Office to expedite the process day and night and has assigned personnel to assist in the work, so that all merchants can receive the payments before the end of the Lunar New Year. Yesterday, he sent an important staff member to supervise the matter. Recent processing has been quite rapid." It is also heard that the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will process and pay security deposits and fixed-term deposit certificates as they arrive, so that merchants can benefit from the policies as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Office of the World Red Swastika Society of Nanxun received a telegram from its Jiujiang relief team yesterday, reporting that the Pingshan and Yunyang ships were bombed last month near Machang, downstream of Jiujiang, causing many passenger casualties (reported in a Hangkou dispatch in the Ta Bao on the 13th of this month). The day after the incident, over a hundred refugees arrived at Tao, requesting relief. Some of them were injured to varying degrees. The slightly injured have been taken in by the Jiujiang branch and treated by the relief team's doctors. The seriously injured have been sent to Tongren Hospital and church hospitals for treatment. Those arriving in Xun who wished to return to their hometowns by ship were escorted onto the ship by team members and given a free ticket worth 200 savings bonds by the shipping company. Also, a female corpse was recovered on the 30th, named Wang Wu, from Hankou. The team buried it promptly and notified her family to come to Xun to claim it. They hope that Shanghai will provide a steady stream of funds and medicine. After receiving the report, the office immediately telegraphed the team to dispatch teams to the Madang area to handle the various tasks of salvaging and burying corpses. They have also sent letters to the Wanjis in Anqing, Wuhu, and Tutu, requesting their assistance. As for funds, in addition to the telegraphed remittance, the association is continuing to raise large sums of money to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Who Can Pass the Year-End Peacefully? <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>December 31st of last year was the end-of-year settlement period for all silver and money businesses in the 32nd year of the Republic, and all businesses were able to pass the year-end peacefully. Tomorrow is Lunar New Year's Eve, and all silver and money businesses are also beginning to handle their end-of-year settlements. It is said that due to the soaring prices of goods over the past year, most businesses have made substantial profits and can also pass the year-end peacefully. Indeed, from the perspective of silver and money businesses, "If we cannot pass the year-end peacefully, who can?" However, from the perspective of the general public, "How many of us can pass the year-end peacefully?" This statement, if left unsaid, is fine, but to say it is truly filled with emotion. This is because the direct cause of the instability in people's lives over the past year is the rampant hoarding and speculative business practices that have driven up prices. By the Lunar New Year, this has left the common people feeling absolutely powerless to purchase anything. At the same time, to barely make it through the Lunar New Year at a minimum standard of living, the only options are to pawn items, sell possessions, borrow money, or even beg for alms. How can one speak of passing the year-end peacefully?</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility of our financial circles in the future is extremely heavy. We have said before that limiting the disruption of commodity prices from the perspective of currency and finance remains an effective price policy. Yesterday, Finance Minister Zhou made a statement saying, "After the Lunar New Year, there may inevitably be hoarding, which will drive up prices. It is hoped that all financial institutions will carefully extend loans, ensuring that the loans issued are used for productive enterprises, which can both stabilize prices and promote production." This is what the financial circles should adhere to in the future, so that perhaps next year on this day, everyone can pass the year-end peacefully. Increasing Production Is the Key Focus.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Chinese and Japanese Authorities Plan to Form Rubber Control Association: Increasing Production Is the Key Focus <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, given the extreme importance of rubber in wartime, both China and Japan should cooperate closely to increase production. Therefore, they are planning to form the Central China Rubber Control Association. The preparatory work for this association is nearing completion and it can be established in the shortest possible time. Its mission will focus on Sino-Japanese cooperation and autonomous production increase. The association's activities will include the following: Production planning and control of rubber products; Planning and standardization of product types; Ensuring the import and export of rubber products and the adjustment of local production; Allocation and price review of rubber products; Procurement of raw materials; Transportation of raw materials; Various investigation matters; Responding to inquiries from relevant authorities; Liaison with relevant control organizations, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Lunar New Year's Eve: Businesses Handle Year-End Settlements; Silver and Money Businesses Have Stopped Extending Loans <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Silver and money businesses, in view of the fact that tomorrow (the 24th) is Lunar New Year's Eve, all money shops, companies, factories, and firms have been rushing to handle their end-of-year settlements. During this period of final accounting, all money shops have uniformly stopped issuing new loans. For all customers with non-contractual overdrafts, it is necessary to completely clear them before the end-of-year settlement. In addition to suspending loans, all transactions are limited to cash. Outstanding customer accounts previously issued are being collected by assigned personnel. At the same time, the Silver Union and money warehouses, for adjusting interbank finance, allow member banks and shops to provide reliable collateral in accordance with borrowing and lending procedures when applying for borrowing. However, the review of the purpose is very strict, limited to normal business needs. The entire financial situation remains stable, and the market's monetary conditions are not very tight. Yesterday's interbank lending rate was still two cents. Therefore, all businesses are determined to pass this year-end peacefully. As for the hours for collecting and remitting at various banks and shops on Lunar New Year's Eve, they will remain the same. However, according to the exchange, the exchange time at the clearing house will be delayed by half an hour compared to normal. Returned checks must be completely returned on the same day. Banks will be closed for three days starting from January 29th, and money shops will be closed for four days. It is said that all businesses in the market will be allowed to trade on the first day of the Lunar New Year on the 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Hoping that the Authorities Will Distribute Salt Soon <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Oil, soy sauce, vinegar, and soy paste are essential condiments for Jin people, among which salt is the most important. Food without salt cannot stimulate appetite; the human body lacks healthy quality without salt, so its importance is no less than that of rice. Since the authorities stipulated that the price of salt should be limited to one yuan and seven jiao per city catty, citizens have had to purchase it on the black market because they have nowhere else to buy it. Furthermore, due to the high price of salt, the prices of side dishes such as soy sauce oil, pickles, salted eggs, seafood, and salted fish have also risen, increasing the burden on citizens and greatly harming people's livelihood.</p>
<p>It has been reported that the authorities had planned to distribute salt to each person a few months ago and have already issued salt purchase certificates to citizens, but the distribution has not yet been announced. Salt is produced in the coastal valley areas of our country, and the output is abundant, always sufficient to supply the needs of people in various places. Its procurement and transportation are far more convenient than rice, sugar, oil, and coal. At a time when the black market is rampant and citizens' needs are urgent, their desire for distribution is no less than that of rice and coal. It is hoped that the authorities will announce the distribution date as soon as possible to reduce the burden on citizens. How fortunate! How fortunate! (Hu Weiyong)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Suggestions for Improving Tram Seating <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Everyone knows that trams are an important means of transportation in the city. Recently, due to the poor source of coal, which has affected the reduction in the amount of electricity supplied, the tram company has had to reduce the number of vehicles and shorten the running time. The crowding of tram passengers and the lack of order when passengers get on and off make everyone feel the difficulty of riding and cause endless distress. I have recently come to Shanghai from neighboring Japan. The measures for improving trams in that country are worth introducing to the people of our country and providing to the tram company as reference materials.</p>
<p>Anyone who has traveled to Japan will not forget the impression of the development of transportation in Japan. There are trams running in major cities to facilitate the transportation of citizens. Recently, due to the expansion of the urban population and the restriction of electricity, the original trams have become insufficient. In order to maintain the tram's sole principle of serving citizens and to adapt to the current environmental restrictions, the tram company has removed one side of the seats on both sides of the tram car in order to accommodate a larger number of passengers. The remaining side of seats is exclusively for the elderly, young, men, women, and wounded soldiers. Since the change of this method, the crowding situation has been greatly eased. Citizens are very satisfied, and the tram company has also achieved quite good results. I believe that Shanghai's military vehicles may as well imitate the neighboring country and make some improvements. Even if there is no great effect, it will definitely be better than the current situation. The work of dismantling the seats in the car is very easy. It saves effort for the tram company and increases the number of passengers, which also increases the company's income. It can be said to be a win-win situation. (Qi)</p>

<p>After coming back from the military observation group, the rest of his vacation, the real person was passing at the sea on Tianbao Mountain. When the new semester started soon after, his spirit was unusually excited, but his body felt a wonderful exhaustion. To overcome this phenomenon, he practiced intensely, and when he came home, his mother said very surprised: "You have a fever, right?" The real person's face was red, staring at his bright eyes. "No!" Although the real person denied it like this, but forced him to measure with a thermometer, it really exceeded 38 degrees.</p>
<p>The real person then collapsed into bed. According to the doctor's diagnosis, there are signs of typhoid fever. Two or three days later, it rose to more than 40 degrees, and the nature of the heat had completely proved to be typhoid fever.</p>
<p>His mother was particularly concerned, needless to say. The main thing was that Songzhi was in charge of nursing, but when the store was slightly empty, his mother would sit by the pillow. "Why did you get such a terrible disease..."</p>
<p>His mother's sigh. There is also a reason. Because no one in the family has ever had an infectious disease. During the military observation group trip, the real person must have caught a cold, and his diet was unbalanced, which must be the cause of the disease. The incubation period of the disease takes two or three weeks, which coincides with the travel period.</p>
<p>But he was young and strong, so he naturally had more recovery power than ordinary people, and after two weeks, he returned to his normal temperature. He then rested for another week.</p>
<p>The recovery period of typhoid fever is to greatly increase appetite, but the real person is firmly restraining himself from this point. The spirit of competition since childhood has also taken effect at this time. It's just that this boring mood is the most unbearable. Longfu and others often came to visit, but his mother was afraid that others would be infected, so she declined their meetings. During the recuperation period, Songzhi, Kayo, did not often come to his pillow. The real person had no choice but to talk to the ceiling and think about all kinds of things.</p>
<p>One day, I didn't expect Siji's brother to bring snacks to the sick room, "You are really bored... you can use these candies."</p>
<p>The very kind brother bought these snacks on the way home to deliver things.</p>
<p>The real person's heart was overjoyed. Suddenly he felt the need to express to his brother this long-cherished wish hidden in his chest.</p>
<p>"Brother, I want to take the naval military academy exam, what do you think?" He said softly in his weak voice after illness. Siji's brother suddenly smiled:</p>
<p>"That's very good... I dropped out of Kagoshima Commercial School halfway, and I hope you can go to a higher-level school.... Okay, I'll talk to my mother for you."</p>
<p>"Thank you." Tears welled up in the real person's eyes</p>

<p>This newspaper and various charitable organizations jointly applied to the Business Control Association for winter clothing cloth at a special price, totaling 1,800 bolts. At that time, due to economic reasons, 1,400 bolts were issued first. When 400 bolts were reissued for the second time, the association had already reported to the Executive Yuan that it was closing down and could no longer handle it. However, half of the winter clothes made by various philanthropists have not yet been received. In view of the large number of people without clothes and the sincere wishes of various philanthropists, this newspaper had to repeatedly request the Business Control Association. It was extended until recently, and it has been approved. The 400 bolts that were not issued before can be paid for and picked up on the 29th of this month. The winter clothes made by various philanthropists can be issued in full around the 11th or 12th of next month. Those who have already refunded the money will not be registered again.</p>
