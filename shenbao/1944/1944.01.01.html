<p>柏林卅一日中央社電　海通社訊：柯洛斯頓貝迪契夫·比拉耶察爾科夫區，二十九日展開激戰，蘇軍大舉進犯為雄厚，並逐步擴大其進攻戰綫，遂使德軍司令部為依照彈性防禦戰略，不得不下令退出柯洛斯頓。德軍在齊托密爾迤東與貝迪契夫迤東，仍予以堅强抵抗，惟遏阻敵軍向貝迪契夫·比拉耶察爾科夫間進展之戰爭，則仍未决定。敵軍在維特勃斯克區續施猛攻，尤集中於通往波洛斯克之鐵路沿綫，卒賴德軍之堅强抵抗，戰局前日並無變化，東綫南路現似將成為蘇軍冬季作戰之主力所在地，敵軍似已在聶伯河中游及維特勃斯克尼維爾區調集大批軍隊及軍火，其對維特勃斯克之重壓義極大，倘該處被蘇軍大規模突破，則將危及波羅的海國家。蘇軍於本年夏季與秋季，即云致力於南路作戰，企圖擊潰德軍之南路戰綫，進而威脅波羅的海區，觀其最近行動，蘇軍在冬季內當再將進行此一戰略。</p>

<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期三日南義前綫之戰事雖屬局部性質，而其活動更趨積極。第勒尼安沿海岸敵軍企圖向溫托諾前進，但在德前陣地衛軍手中　受重大損失，以致不得不中止進攻。同時敵在附近地區之登陸行動，對於克拉克將軍之部隊亦無所補救，登陸部隊尙未抵達海岸附近之維挨阿披亞之前，早已被阻而被包圍，美軍經砲兵多時之凖備後，在接近米納諾至卡西諾公路入口處之西部亞平寗山中發動猛攻，但在未抵遠德軍地雷綱之前，即被擊退。維納弗洛之北敵向曼納爾特山支脈之德防綫進攻三次，均未得逞。同時東部戰綫加拿大軍一中隊在奧爾托納之北企圖猛攻，結果在德軍防禦砲火中宣吿崩潰。據報吿稱，帝國軍隊已在該地區建築戰地臨時堡壘，藉以抵禦優越之德砲隊。加拿大軍二中隊在沿海岸附近發動衝鋒戰略，結果為德軍先鋒隊所阻</p>

<h3 id="c16">元旦的期望　今年是「革新年」 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>今天是中華民國三十三年元旦，當此一年開始之日，對於未來一年中的一切，照例應作一番期望的獻辭。可是，今天我們不想好高騖遠，只想說幾句老實話，貢獻當道，同時期望人民大衆。因為環顧內外情勢，不得不奮發自勵，以求革新。我們期望政府在今年度內領導人民實現革新的有三點。</p>
<p>第一，希望「政治清明」。我們老百姓只希望有好人政府，廉潔政治，政府中盡是好人，政治才能廉潔，才可達於「政治淸明」之境。什麼天花亂墜，炫人聽聞的主議，理論，口號，十多年來實在太多了。而政治成績，實際上十不逮一，所以，老百姓對此早已聽得厭倦。今年只需要簡簡單單的好人政府，切切實實的廉潔政治。</p>
<p>第二，希望「解除民生首疾苦」。政府與民更始，以解除人民生活上的困難痛苦，為决定施政力針之對象。然後人民對於政府心悅誠服，圍結一致，發生力量。</p>
<p>第三，希望「實踐參戰」。我們參戰雖已近年，而實際上對於戰爭不僅無直接今年必須實踐參任務，進而共同建設大東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>上面提出的三點，前二者完全是政府的責任，後者則由政府領導，人民共同協力。然則，如何可以達到希望呢？我們貢獻左列意見：</p>
<p>關於第一點，希望有好人政府，最主要的當然在人事問題，第一步調整人事，使適人適事，第二步調整待遇，使官吏廉潔。最近政府起用張一　氏，是値得稱　的賢明措置，不僅因事擇人，且予民間一新耳目。目前和平區內，有資望有能幹的人才，數不在少，政府如能誠懇延攬，對於政治有與趣者，任命政治工作，對於政治無興趣者，敦促擔任社會工作，使野無遺材，而官吏咸有所長，同時講求廉潔，不難成為「好人政府」。如政府抱關門主義，不求人才，則是政府之失策；如政府能破除黨見，廣徵人才，而人民自鳴淸高，固拒合作，則是人民之不當。我們希望自起用張一鵬氏開如，政府廣徵人才，人民樂於參加政府以及社會工作。其次，裁撤駢枝機關，使行政簡案化，注重效率。</p>
<p>關於第二點，解除民生疾苦，目前最急迫者，為物價問題。因為物價上漲，漫無止境，使每個人民都受嚴重　脅。其次，培養民力，因為民力充足，可為政府的後盾。依照目前事實，國民黨員在全民中佔極少數，决不能單獨擔當全國的重任，一定需要培養全民力量，平均發展，才能共同擔當重任，而且共產黨在戰時，最會利用機公，擴展勢力，危害國家民族。所以，國民黨非一面培養全民力量，一面與全民打成一片，不足以阻止共產黨蔓延。培養民力的最主要工作，就是使人民有參政機會，有要求改善自己生活的權利。在人民方面，一面培養自身力量，一面必須擁護執政黨政策，共同挽救目前及未來的危機。如果政府離開人民，恐懼人民力量，堅執獨裁，則是自取滅亡之俄帝，而人民不知一而督促政府，一面擁護政府，也是自取滅亡。政府與人民，合則存，不合則亡，已為很顯明的事理了。</p>
<p>關於第三點，必先充分做到上面的兩點以後，才能談到「實踐參戰」。否則，侈談參戰與過去同樣的徒託空言，决無實際貢獻。實踐了參戰任務，才說得上與盟邦協同爭取勝利，才說得上共同建設大東亞新秩序。</p>
<p>於此，我們須向盟邦朝野獻言的，希望日本朝野必須重視中國人民力量，認清中國人民的要求，幫助中國人民培養自己的力量，使中國人民抬頭，然後中國問題才可樂觀，中日關係才可樂觀。</p>
<p>今年是「革新年」，希望政府自己革新！人民自己革新，同時督促政府革新！盟邦協助我們革新！</p>

<p>讀了陳市長吿市民書（見元旦特刋第一版）以後，我們相信每一個市民都有一種相同的感覺，就是「眞」與「誠」。</p>
<p>我們在市民立塲，最理想的市長，必須具備兩個特點：第一，澈底瞭解地方實情及市民需要。第二，協助市民解除各種痛苦。現在陳市長對於第一點已經做到，同時，更誠摯表示解决各種問題，這在上海市民是多麽欣幸的事。</p>
<p>我們早曾說過上海是在和平區內居於最重要的地位：同時，也是中日合作最密切的地方。過去往往責備英美的罪惡。可是，現在已經是我們自己管理，同時有盟邦協力，中日雙方最優秀的人才又薈萃於此，所以，在客觀上如果上海管理不好，則不必談遠者大者，更不配責備以往了。</p>
<p>我們理想中的上海，成為和平區內的政治模範區，必先從建立好人政府，廉潔政治入手。更進而成為中日合作的模範區，中國方面聘用日本專家輔佐治理，而日本方面就須盡力協助，革新一切。</p>
<p>最緊要的一句話，上海想成為政治模範區，中日合作模範區，必須趕快成立民意機構，這是我們在接收租界之時即已提出，同時陳市長曾表示稍緩即可成立。我們認為惟有從速成立民意機構，社會上才有領導的中堅分子，也就是今天市長所熱烈期望的。</p>

<p>歲聿更新民國三十三年從今開始了。我們在經濟界言經濟，祇覺過去一年中，經濟界　曾見過許許多多驚天動地的創作，或則與調整幣制有關，或則與增加生產有關，或則與取締囤積有關，或則與實施配給有關，或則與防止投機有關，成則與節約消費有關，在表面上，誠足蔚為過去一年來，戰時統制經濟之大觀，可是，整個的國民經濟，在實質上，又是多麽不如人意。言生產，正是昨天我們社評所說：政府政治上倡導戰時增加生產，而在國民經濟實質上反映的却是生產遞減；言節約，除了節約陽光可算得是最為有效外，有人一餐數千元，一擲數萬元以至數百萬元，而禁絕烟賭舞是否能够成為事實，至今還是疑問；此外，囤積者自囤積，投機者自投機；而且，貶視幣値的心理，高抬物價的行為，日甚一日，大有變本加厲之勢；同時，配給方面，不是無米，便是無煤，徒使最大多數的人民，感覺惶惶不可終日。</p>
<p>我們所期待於今年者，是整個國民經濟實質上的好轉，力謀樹立東亞共榮圈之經濟。什麽是東亞共榮圈之經濟？就是以其圈內之人力物力為基礎，厲行澈底的統制經濟，以實充實軍備，安定民生，而謀國民經濟之恒久與普遍的繁榮，尤其是，站在戰時統制經濟旗　的下面，我們今後必須加倍努力於經濟新體制之十二分貫澈，毋令生產力低下，配給不圓滑，民生不安定的種種弊害，繼續存在於今年的經濟界。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>靑春（八）</p>
<p>雖說是春季的學期，到香蕉花兒盛開，枇杷成熟的時候，巳完全是夏季的氣候了。</p>
<p>「我已經在與次郞海濱游泳過！」</p>
<p>聽到朋友們那樣的話，眞人也耐不住地想去游泳了。可是在小學時代，因游泳而患過中耳炎，被母親知道了以後，怎樣也不允許了。</p>
<p>沒有方法，眞人乃專門硏究柔道。柔道適合他的天性，進步很快。此外，像棒球，綱球等運動什麽也都來一下，但最精的祇有柔道。</p>
<p>柔道衣服好像浴室的席子般，被汗水　濕了的時候，便用冷水揩拭身體，從武術塲出來的那副心境，是不會忘記的。楠木的影子，也在悠長的時間中，被從海那邊來的凉風吹拂着。運動塲中，人影也沒有，只有校舍靜寂地　在那裏。</p>
<p>好友隆夫在劍道部，所以硏究的時間不同，不在一起。眞人搭着柔道衣服，信步在運動塲的一角走着。</p>
<p>突然在被日蔭遮掩着的角落裏，他見到像石碑般的東西竪在那裏。</p>
<p>（這東西到現在還沒有知道呢……）</p>
<p>雖不是古舊的石碑。但魁偉地，下面有　石，在天然石的碑面上，刻着「中原猶介翁宅址碑」的字樣。</p>
<p>（中原猶介是誰……）</p>
<p>眞人仰着頭。</p>
<p>鹿兒島是多址碑的地方，調加治　町去，建着西鄕南洲，大久保利　，和東鄕元帥的　生地碑。另外，如乃木靜子夫人，大山公等，也在各個處所建着各個的碑。而且，這些碑的主的主人，即使不是鹿兒島人，祇要是日本人，誰也知道這些名字。終究因為是偉人，才建碑紀念他。</p>
<p>中原猶介那個人，到沒有聽見說起過。或許是西鄕公的下屬，在城山戰死的人吧！可是數着桐野·村田·別府以下諸人的名字，那中間沒有這人。在什麽地方，做些什麽樣事的人呢？連建在母校校庭裏的碑主都不知道，那太不像樣子了——</p>
<p>眞人　緊着一隻眼，讀那磚面上彫着的小字：</p>
<p>「翁字尙雄，通稱猶介，號鐵心齋。鹿兒島藩士中原尙通之次子，資性英邁，夙有志於文武，精通砲術。擢為照國公，作御　藥方，專硏究舍密學」。碑文往下還有很多的字，眞人念到舍密學字樣，讀不下去了。</p>
<p>（做什麽的？這是一個醫師吧）？</p>

<p>中華民國三十三年元旦特刋</p>
<h3 id="c42">汪主席元旦訓詞 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>主席於去年十二月十九日，在盟邦陸軍醫院施行手術、割取背彈，經過極爲良好，僅當日全日休息靜養，二十日起即分別召見各院部會長官，在榻前面授機宜，處理政治軍事外交大計。　日以來精神日見進步，傷口完全平復，一如軍醫之所預定。外科癢治已如期完成，惟手術之後，血氣健康尙需內科上之調補。元旦典禮循幹部同志之請，由溫院長主持主席，特頒此談話，勗勉國人全文如左：</p>
<p>我們今日承著中日同盟條約大東亞共同宣言之後，迎取三十三年的元旦，中日友好關係之增進，有了更光輝的途徑。大東亞各國家民族之聯繫，有了更明允的凖則，大東亞戰爭决戰之勝利，有了更確實的把握，中國的獨立，東亞的解放，有了更可靠的保障。對著這前途的光明，用不著徘徊瞻顧，對於今後的前進方針和步驟，也用不著標新立異。我們祇有一本歴來的政策，向著「肅正思想」「保障治安」「增加生產」三大工作，爲更進一步的努力。拿出全副精神，放在「決戰第一」上面，以謀大東亞戰爭目的之完遂，大東亞共榮建設之積極發展，由此而完成興復中華保衛東亞的變重使命。</p>
<p>怎樣更進一步的努力呢？</p>
<p>展開新時代的文化運動</p>
<p>先就肅正思想來說，廓淸英美毒素思想，摧毀對封建殘餘觀念，是現階段思想戰的兩大目的。欲達到此目的，必須由標語口號的宣傳，做到有組織有紀律有條理的實踐，在這一個前提之下，今年的一年，一方面應該結集思想戰上所有人力物力，展開新時代的文化運動，使文化組織更普遍而深入，文化事業更健全而向上，民意更活躍而團結，民情更激勵而嚴肅，另一方面尤其要使全國同胞，自政府官史軍隊以至十農工商，一致勵行新國民運動的實踐工作。人人自肅自檢，大東亞戰爭是東亞民族盛衰興廢的戰爭，也就是中國生死存亡的戰爭，所有足以妨害决戰意志之昂揚，斷喪民族精神之振奮的，必須一一摧陷而廓淸之。舉例來說，貪污賣職，是腐融政治的惡菌；囤積居奇，是荼毒民生的蠢蟲；敲詐勒索，是擾亂社會的禍根；頹廢放蕩，是削弱種族的毒素；以及其他與此相緣而生的一切黑暗現象，都是戰爭時生活所不能忍，民族生存所不能容的。在今年的一年中，都要掃蕩之，不遺餘力。政府於此，應確立嚴懲貪污獎勵廉潔的制度，民衆於此，尤應相與奮起，倡率廉潔檏素的風尙，務以政府民衆的協力，創造政治上社會上的新環境。必如此方才能建立國家民族的新生命，必如此方才能担負總力决戰與復興建設的責任。</p>
<p>加強軍力加強民衆自衛</p>
<p>就保障治安來說，保障治安是軍隊的責任，同時也是民衆的責任，今年的一年，當推進原定的軍事計劃，加強軍事的力量，更進而加強民衆自衛的力量。於此尙有應明白認識的兩點，第一建軍的精義，要質與量同時並重，要精神敎育與軍事設備軍事技術同時並進。今後軍隊的編練，必須於此加以注意。第二　國你常說；「要使武力與民衆相結合保障治安」云云，最重要的就是要保障民衆使之安居東業，尤其是要保障生產民衆，使生產事業得到安全發達，生產力量得到培養擴充，軍隊能做到這一層，民衆　感覺到軍隊的密切關係。同時更進一步，使民衆自己這樣，軍隊　能發揮其向上的力量與技能，以從事國防。總之，民衆是國力的基礎，也就是武力的泉源，沒有民衆不發展而軍隊能充實的。所以我們必須於加強軍事力量之中，同時加強人民的自衛力量，使這兩種力量，緊緊結合，成爲保障治安的一根一幹，進而成爲國防的一根一幹。</p>
<p>增產總動員的一年</p>
<p>再就增加生產來說，今年的一年，應該是增產運動總動員的一年，爲着動員人力物力貢獻於大東亞戰爭，我們要增加生產爲着充裕物資調節物價改善民生我們要增加生產；我們要使現有的人力物力不要祇只消耗沒有補充，我們要使增長出來的結果，不要淪落在少數人的身上，要爲大衆國家爲東亞而用得其當。我們尤其要保護生產力，培養生產力，幸生產力，使能用之於再生產，用之於擴大再生產。只有這樣，增產兩字才有　實而可貴的意義。目前國計民生最急切的需要，一個是衣，一個是食，所以增產工作也就應該首先從農業輕工業着手。農業方面，食糧棉花的增產，是第一要着，輕工業方面，麥粉工業紡織工業之改進，是第一要着。就算以目前力量之所能及，說不到足衣足食，也要合政府與人民的全力，使衣食問題得到合理而可能的解決。使一般民衆，尤其是生產民衆，在刻苦耐勞的去忍受戰爭期間不可免的痛苦之中，至少把那些層層煎迫的不必要之人爲的痛苦，一步一步的解除。政府方面要革除濫調，拿出實際方案，沈着的去做，民衆方面，也再不要袖手旁觀搖頭太息，而要羣策羣力，脚踏實地去做，過剩的游資，應該用之於增產，不事生產的人力，應該用之於增產，業餘的時間，應該用之於增產，過份的享受無謂的消耗，應該盡量節約，用之於增產，日常用品以及農工商各業剩餘的廢物，也應該收集起來。用之於增產。所以增產運動與儲蓄運動，節約運動，以及廢物利用運動，有不可偏廢的關係。必須同時並舉。不儲蓄不節約，則增產所需的財力物力無從結集，而增產得來的結果，也只有白白消耗，不能用之於再生產，不知道廢物利用，則在原料缺乏之今日，侈言增產也是徒然。</p>
<p>以上很簡單的，把今年要做的工作重點寫出來，盼望全國同胞，知行一致，一步步的做到。</p>
<p>新歲獻辭</p>
<h3 id="c43">日本東條首相 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>茲值昭和十九年之新春，我等一億國民謹奉祝聖壽萬歲，並祈皇室之彌榮與邦家之昌隆，實不勝感激之至。自拜奉宣戰大詔以來，兩年於茲，我將士之善謀勇戰，與一億國民之努力奮鬥，於聖威下，向世界宣揚皇威，建設大東亞確立世界和平之理想，亦逐步實現。大東亞戰爭之目的，誠如宣戰大詔中所宣示者，乃在求我國之自存自衛，以確保東亞安寗，確立眞正萬邦共榮之世界秩序，此實全係根據我肇國精神者。我國之意圖，即大東亞十億民族之共同理想，大東亞會議中通過之大東亞共同宣言，已向全世界閘明全東亞人之共同意志，我軍將士踴躍出征，以衝撞敵機精神，作必勝之攻擊，或全休玉碎，爲國捐驅，不期生還，爲大元帥陛下，不惜犧牲一切。</p>
<p>愈困難愈團結</p>
<p>以言國內愈困難則愈團結，我一億國民，已以旺盛之精神，努力增強戰力，此與敵英美，則有天壤之別，今因敵英美力謀反攻，故戰局倍極苛烈，大東亞戰爭之勝敗與大東亞建設之成否，胥賴粉碎英美之反攻，因此我一億國民，均已作戰鬥配置，不分前綫與後方，均打成一片，擊滅英美，奉戴萬世一系之天皇，舉一君萬民，舉國一　之成果，即此，我國　之亦以冠絕世界者也。一旦有事，凡我國民，決爲國犧牲，是即我皇國傳統與日本國民之精神，今實即我一億國民於聖威下，一致團結，傾舉全力，發揮日人本領之良機。天皇陛下，爲芟除東亞禍根，確立東亞永久和平，日夜軫念，凡我國民無不異常恐懼，我一億國民，常奉戴御心，對以外以一死報國之精神，粉身碎骨，在所不惜。內則犧牲小我，掃除摩擦，互相扶助，持身嚴謹，互相勉勵，戰時生活，俾期全體作戰鬥配置後，無一人落伍者，而爲天皇陛下奉公。今日我歐洲盟邦與我共同奮鬥，防禦敵方反攻，其戰意愈形軒昂，現爲擊滅英美，正努力以赴，我等則粉碎敵方一切謀略，愈益緊密提携，東西相呼應攻擊英美，以期達成共同使命。</p>
<p>澈底擊滅英美</p>
<p>又吾人對大東亞各國家，各民族爲完成大東亞戰爭，建設大東亞，致莫大之努力，於此，謹深致謝忱，並願大東亞十億同胞，互相提携，澈底擊滅東亞侵略者之英美，俾建設立足於道義之大東亞貢獻世界和平，際茲大地春回，萬象更新之際，願以必勝信念，與國人共勉，並願加強我國與東亞盟邦之團結，以擊滅企圖制霸世界之英美，而爭取最後勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c44">日本駐華艦隊近藤司令長官 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>大東亞戰爭烽火舉後，已三度欣逢新年，於茲遙祝聖壽萬歲，皇室彌榮，此誠我大和民族之無上光榮。</p>
<p>今歲已屆决戰之年，且爲舉國動員澈底粉碎敵人一切企圖，以完成擊滅英美之秋，預料敵人英美亦將施共各種手段，出諸反攻，戰局當將愈演愈烈，尤以敵人將施展政略上及思想上之謀略，亦不難想像者。我國民應抱必勝决心，鞏固團結，無論前綫後方，於戰鬥職守，各傾全力，努力擴充生產，幸運輸，動員人力，以期擊滅英美兵力，尤於智能動員上，更須舉英美所不能企及之成果。</p>
<p>在大東亞共榮圈內，應使以中日滿三國爲中心之决戰陣容益爲強固，制敵於無隙可乘，結集全大東亞民族總力，邁開建設大東亞之巨步，向擊滅英美之共同使命勇往直前，吾人在此祈神明加護正義，我等誓以在人事上盡最大努力，　成聖戰目的。</p>
<h3 id="c45">日本駐華谷大使 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>當此戰事日烈，决戰形勢益趨緊迫之時，迎此征戰之第三年之元旦，僅先奉賀，聖壽無疆，皇室彌榮，並决以突破時艱之决心竭誠奉公，爲完遂我皇國聖業而益固粉身碎骨之誓。</p>
<p>回顧開戰以來，未及半年，即將英美之侵略勢力悉數自東亞各據點驅逐掃蕩，解放大東亞之天地，日本一面推進戰爭建設之理念，對英美繼續勇猛　烈戰鬥，同時根據道義在戰火之中，以實現大東亞新秩序建設之大業，於此緬甸菲律賓兩獨立國旣先後誕生，印度納西亞民族亦獲得明朗的參與政治之途。此外有泰國之擴張版圖，而一俗人分担建設大東亞共榮圈之意氣，又英侵略東亞中之最大犧牲者印度，亦已成立自由印度臨時政府，整備爲爭取獨立而堂堂進擊之態勢，再中華民國除於去春對英美佈吿實戰，又完成廢除鴉片戰爭以來之屈辱的不平條約，而完整自主獨立，確立爲大東亞主要國家之基礎外，並於客秋與帝國訂結同盟條約，樹立中日永遠之友好關係，而鎭護北方之滿洲國，亦國勢日隆，此皆爲深堪同慶者。</p>
<p>又帝國關於建設大東亞之努力，亦已迅速獲得實績，如客秋大東亞六大獨立國代表，會於一堂，發表歷史的共同宣言，實爲空前未有之盛事，並確保大東亞十億民族所可永久誇耀者。</p>
<p>抑帝國戰爭之目的在解放東亞，恢復東亞之自由，建設東亞各民族共榮之新秩序，確信唯有此種理想之不悖中外古今之歷史，而即可貢獻於人類之幸福者。反之英美此次作戰目的，一面稱爲在確保自由，一面則籎以大西洋憲章，不適用於太平洋，不與印度以自由又不承認菲律賓緬甸之自主獨立，且猶欲東亞各民族復歸於昔日不自由之狀態。彼等爲達成此種自私的戰爭目的，竟以掩耳盜鈴之態度，一再反攻，似將以本年爲决戰，期作大規模之作戰，行動，故時局之重大，實爲曠古所未有，謂此爲帝國隆盛東亞興廢之一年亦决非過言。際此重大决戰下新春，吾人對於爲皇國聖業基礎之英靈，實具無限感謝。再祝辭各地英勇作戰之皇軍將士，武運長久，同時深期以前綫果改作戰之精神，爲完遂聖戰而奮勇邁進。</p>
<h3 id="c46">日本駐華田尻公使 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>日本爲謀大東亞之解放與獨立起見，自　起鏟除英美制霸東亞野心以來，茲已欣逢第三年新年。在此一年內，吾人連續獲得輝煌大戰果，同時大東亞各國家各民族，亦一致協力，推進亞洲之自立復興，誠屬欣快之至。</p>
<p>開戰二年以來日本一億之决意與大東亞十億共同决意，業已完全一致。英美不獨對抗日本一億之鐵石團結，亦爲叛逆大東亞十億之正義。今日大東亞戰爭之展開，正爲日益顚落之英美野心應受之打刼。在解放亞洲獨立途上，實可謂亞洲所應付光榮之犧牲。大東亞十億共同之决意於去年十一月初旬舉行大東亞會議當時益見昂揚。大東亞共同宣言將建設大東亞新秩序及建設世界新秩序之理念網領闡發無餘。即大東亞新秩序之建設，乃以大東亞各國家各民族之共存共榮獨立親和，文化昂揚，經濟繁榮及進而貢獻世界進步等五大原則爲綱領。在目前所建設新秩序之下，各國各得其所相倚相扶，以臻萬邦共榮之樂，</p>

<p>— 陳公博</p>
<p>親愛的市民們：</p>
<p>今天是中華民國三十三年的元旦，是新歲之始，我於祝市民新禧之際，敢披誠對市民諸君有所奉吿。</p>
<p>我今天不談大東亞戰爭，我們昕夕努力以赴大東亞戰爭，努力以赴大東亞民族的解放及本身的解放，因此我們祇有，毋庸再談。我今天也不談上海本年的市政方針，因爲兩租界已於去年七月三十日及八月一日分別收回，市政已吿統一，我於統一市政的前後，已對市民諸君亽了許多話，今後祇有切實執行，也毋庸再談，我今天所欲奉吿於市民諸君者，本年有政府當爲之事，也有市民當爲之事，滐願開誠相吿，使朝野合力，建成一個清潔繁榮的大上海。</p>
<p>我先說政府當爲之事罷，我的爲人不掩飾，不舖張，我吿訴諸者，上海今日已到了嚴重的局勢了，我發覺上海有一件很畸形的事，同時更有一件很矛盾的事。什麼是畸形的事呢？就是政府的公務員所得的薪俸是不够維持生活的，一般商人依照其正當營業所得的利潤也不够維持開支的，甚至一般工人也不能照他們每月或每日獲得的工資來糊口的。因此綱紀岌岌，社會騷然，這是一件畸形的事。什麼是矛盾的事呢？照道理說，平時固然要生產，戰時尤當增加生產，否則在前方不能得到充分的供給，在後方不能得到適當的生活，可是上海因爲缺乏燃料而減少了生產了，以前也試過因囤積原料牟利而懶得生產了，這是一件矛盾的事。</p>
<p>上海有了一件畸形的事，加上一件矛盾的事，於是生活不能正常，思想因之紛亂，法律有時失其效力，首先更因而反常，長此以往，整個社會是要覆沒的，要挽救這種畸形，要消滅這種矛盾，這是政府所當爲的大事，我忝居一市長，對於這些問聞，一定要設法補救的，可是我個人的力量有限，非合全市的人民的力量做去不爲功，更非中央與地方合力不爲功，例如物價之暴漲，其一坐於物資的缺乏，其二坐於私人之囤積，其三坐於評定機關之不統一，雖然原因很多，而增加生產却爲補救的不二法門，我們能够繼續生產，私人無從囤積，而評定物價自然有所依據。最近我對於評定物價的機關已盡力統一了，對於囤積也極力取締了，但要繼續生產，第一生產資金的利息要低，第二要生產的原料要取得，第三要運輸的方法要靈通。對於生產資金，我們必須要籌措的，上海金融界要努力的，中央更要援助的。至於原料之取得各運輸方法的靈活，那麼政府應盡量設法的。經濟問題能够解決，那麼其他問題都可以順利的解決。我深信除了經濟便更無所謂政治，這一層政府必須全部負責的。</p>
<p>我可以說市民當爲之事了，上海本爲東方一個大都市，也是世界一個大都市，大都市有其美點與缺點，故上海充滿不能史的缺點，故上海充滿不能免的缺點，自在意中，然而上海最近，更加飮狂泉，如赴落日，似乎世界末日將至，盡其一息，以爲狂歡，直到今日，我以爲上海的投仍和奢　兩大缺點應當立刻糾正了。我所謂投機，不但指黃金證券的競奪買賣，就是物價狂漲，也是和種投機，我們要知經濟的狀態，自有其天然的平衡，一種物價的暴漲，必牽動其他物價同時上升的，我看見各業公會祇顧目前的暴利，不復計及將來，凡一業之暴利，其結果仍加之本身，往復疊漲，終有不勝其重負而致顚覆之一日，我很替市民危懼，不知道市民諸君亦有感覺否？其次則奢侈之風，殊足駭人聽聞，一服之微，一飯之費，無不　奢極侈，舉凡婚姻喪祭宴會娛樂，其放誕糜費，有非常人所敢信者，我長上海市已三年了，初至之時，視之目眙口　，今日習視亦已三年，然而猶覺頭眩心悸，我爲此也曾厯厯誥誡上海的市民，可是言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，我最痛心的，不但市民不自省遷善，而少數僚屬亦盲然從惡，從無戰爭，上海亦將陸沉。</p>
<p>凡趨利者必忘義，從慾者必忘恥，上海做成此種風氣，自然有所自來，我奉勸上海市民這些海派作風也應當及時根本改正了，我深望上海於庶矣富矣之外，應當敎之，我所謂敎育，不但學校當局應負指導靑年之責，就是家庭的父母以及社會領導的人士，也當以身作則爲濁世倡。</p>
<p>末了，我要對上海的靑少年說幾句話了，上海的禁賭禁烟禁舞運動發動，我適在南京，我知道這個消息以後，我眞是一則以喜，一則以懼，喜者以靑年最少能够具有善善惡惡的心，而懼者則深怕靑年們軼出範圍，予社會以靑年紊亂秩序的惡印象。還都以來，我都敎育靑年以做人，我們中國直到今日的積弱地步，不外夫人自侮，然後人侮之，所以我有兩句格言，復興中國，從做人起，換一句話，我們自己不會做人，而想別人做人，永無此理。因此我希望靑年自己首先學做人，我所謂做人的條件也很簡單，即是負責任，守尊嚴，求知識。自事變以後，上海不但形變而質都變了，上海以前本來已够複雜，事變以後更是複雜，我在二十九年到上海以後，即主禁賭，經過許多困難，滬西賭博才於三十年春禁止，這是人所共知的。至於南市我已於去年十二月初旬下令準於三月二十九日禁絕，事前經過决心，事後又聯絡各方面。至於舞是比較單純，而烟更複雜了。我忝爲一市之長，對於這種事實深惡痛絕較靑少年爲尤甚因爲靑年們祇只熱誠，而我更是要負責任的。現在事已過去，我也不必再談，我祇有希望靑年們决心以身作則，不但今日以身作則，將來在社會服務，在政府服務，也須以身作則，在今日要嚴守紀律，在他日更要自肅紀綱，這是我對於靑年們極端期望的。</p>
<p>此外我更有一句話要對上海一般社會說的，靑年運動是熱誠，而反一方面則明示上海沒有社會領導的中堅，靑年在學時期，而有這種激越行動，很顯明的是一種社會變態的象徽。如果社會有了中堅，領導得宜，靑年正可安心求學，不必分心過問這些份外之事，我深盼上海社會明達之士出面負責，一面協助政府，一面領導靑年，使社會日有進步，而大都市的缺點得以補救。</p>
<p>以上所陳，都是我披誠向我市民　吿的，我負起政府應爲的責任，而各市民應負起市民應爲的責任，官民合作，淸潔繁榮的大上海，建設即在目前，我們的市民諸君，籍今日萬象更新之際，共同奮起，來建設這個新上海吧。</p>

<h3 id="c48">上海的燃料恐慌問題 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 野人</p>
<p>滬地居民在今日所感覺切膚之痛的，首推食的問題，可是糧食的嚴重情況尙未解除，而燃料的恐慌，繼之而起，且有愈演愈列之勢。俗說說「巧婦難爲無米之炊」，即係指糧食問題而言，又有「生米難成熟飯」之語，即係指燃料問題而言，吾人欲求生存，即不能不談「食」的問題，要談到「食」的問題，就脫離不了「米糧」與「燃料」。米糧一問題，學者間已經討論得很熱烈，很詳細，作者可以無須饒舌，所以打算在此地來討論一下「燃料問題」。</p>
<p>上海的燃料，無論家庭所必需的煤球，或是工廠，公用事業所需用的動力，均以煤斤爲主體。本篇所討論的，擬以家庭用煤球爲主，而工廠及公用事業需用之煤，在叙述煤斤之供應消費情況時，亦連帶涉及，以供有心人士之參考。</p>
<p>一　上海煤斤之消費情況</p>
<p>煤斤消費的多寡，與一般社會經濟，有密切關係。平時上海煤斤的消費數量，每年在三百萬公噸左右。據上海市社會局在民國二十三年之調查統計，本市煤斤之消費，以工廠輪船與電力公司之需要量爲最鉅，家庭及鐵道之使用量次之，茲根據日譯本「企業地之上海」，表列各業消費數量於下：</p>
<p>上列數字，是否可考，統計是否翔實，雖屬疑問，但是本市煤斤消費之情況，已可知其梗概。後來八一三事變發生，工廠損毀的旣然很多，且有不少工廠，因受時局的影響，停工減工的，也不在少數，因之煤斤的消費量，大爲減少，山崎經濟研究所曾根據上海電力公司之給電量，推算一九四〇年十二月份上海煤斤消費的情況，有如下表：</p>
<p>如根據上表推算，上海每年煤斤消費總額，不過六十餘萬公噸，即令加上輪船，鐵道等消費數量，較之事變以前，相去已不可以道里計。自從太平洋戰事發生，上海對外交通，固然完全斷絕，同時原料的輸入，國內的行銷，亦受到統制的限制，因之一般工業，大都受到影響，而停工減工，煤斤消耗數量，當然隨之減少。根據大中聯煤號直配額，統計民國卅一年七月至十一月底五個月，配給上海華人工商業與居民各類煤斤，爲一九〇·四七二公噸，平均每月配給量爲三九·〇〇三公噸，則每年合計爲四六八，〇三六公噸，較之事變前後，數量又形減少。</p>
<p>根據上述統計，家庭用煤，佔全市總消費量七·三八％，煤球廠用煤佔八〇·九六％，兩者合計，佔八八·三四％，工廠用煤，僅佔總消費量一一·六四％，可見其地位之今昔懸殊　如今不妨假定上海煤斤的消費量，在事變以前，年需三百萬公噸，事變以後，年需一百萬公噸，太平洋戰爭發生後，更節約至一年消費量爲七十萬公噸。而後與上海歷年煤斤供應的情況，加以比較則眞相自易明瞭。</p>
<p>二　上海煤斤之供應情況</p>
<p>上海自成爲東亞國際商埠以來，人口一天天的集中，工商一天天的繁榮，因之所需要的煤斤，亦一天天的增加起來。考察上海煤斤的來源，平素仰給華北，經常佔上海供應量百分之九十以上。但自八一三事變以後，北煤南運，很受影響，因之依存外煤，與年俱增。</p>
<p>事變前構成上海國煤之供給主體者，以開灤·山東·中興等公司出產的烟煤爲主，次爲河北·山西等省的白煤，淮南等華中煤產，可說無關重要。事變後，開灤·山東·中興等煤斤，雖仍居主體，但是數量已經激減，至於山西煤產，在滬地早已絕跡，所以不得不從越南等地設法，而淮南烟煤的供給，也漸形重要。</p>
<p>上海國煤供給市場之變化（單位公噸）</p>
<p>注：一九三六年數字，係根據某公司之調查；一九四〇年數字，係根據滿鐵公司之調查，故與前表數字不符，但可明瞭其大概情況。</p>
<p>外煤的輸入，過去限於越南鴻基之白煤，次爲日本煤，事後因爲烟煤亦感恐慌，因之印度烟煤，亦有大量來滬。</p>
<p>自從太平料戰爭爆發以來，情勢頓起變化，海外交通斷絕，外煤自然無法續來，上海燃料，大起恐慌。於是日方有關當局，講究華北煤斤，由陸路　滬的對策。因之本市煤斤供應市場，形成如次的狀態：</p>
<p>事變以前，每日到滬煤斤之數量，約爲一萬公噸左右，而民國三十一年以及三十二年上半年本市煤斤每日運到的數量及其來源，據某公司的調查，有如下表：</p>
<p>上項到滬白煤，全部由陸路運來，烟煤屑有一小部份，仍由輪船運滬，以之供應滬地華人工商業與家庭消費（每月計爲三九〇〇三公噸，見前表）雖有餘裕，如連日本方面，公用事業，以及舟車各方面的用煤，數量約略相等。</p>
<p>三　上海煤斤統制配給之機構</p>
<p>上海之有煤斤統制配給的機構，始於一九三九年七月虹口日商所組織的上海石炭聯合會，設法搬運華北，化中，台灣，朝鮮，以至日本國內煤斤來滬，以供上海日商及軍需之用。當時歸興亞院華中聯絡部管轄（今已移　日本大使館上海事務所）其職務爲：</p>
<p>決定煤斤輸移入之會員別定額分配事宜。</p>
<p>决定煤斤輸移入之產業別定額分配事宜。</p>
<p>決定煤斤之販賣，定貨等價格及辦理其輸送事宜。</p>
<p>辦理　中煤斤供需與生產調查事宜。</p>
<p>此後爲嚴密煤斤販賣上之統制，復組　「上海石炭商同業組合」辦理　販賣價格之决定；　零售業之統一；　家用　煤斤之供需調整等事宜。未幾又有「台灣骸炭輸入組合」相繼成立。前者係零售商之組織，後者專門辦理輸入台灣骸炭及決定其販賣價格與供需調整等事宜。均受興亞院華中聯絡部的管轄。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事發生後，本市煤斤供需失調，羣情恐慌。租界區內煤斤同業商，在興亞院華中聯絡部指導下，亦成立各種統制配給之機構如「大中聯煤號」，設立於三十一年二月一日「上海煤業同業商聯合會」設立於三十一年四月十三日及「上海煤球廠公會」，設立於三十一年五月五日，均受日商「上海石炭聯合會」的統轄。凡屬　煤斤販賣價格之決定，　煤斤運輸及供需調整之研究事項，　零售商之統一及同業間之協　等事項，均歸「上海煤業同業商聯合會」所經營。凡屬租界區域內華商煤球廠及甲小華商工廠所　煤斤，均由「大中聯煤號」所經營。惟華商各煤球廠所需煤斤，均由該號直接發配。至於一般家用和工商用煤，則由該號發配於同業或零售商轉配之。「上海煤球廠公會」的業務，則爲　辦理煤斤配給之申請，　產量之決定，製品標準之統一；　販賣價格之决定；　辦理製品搬運手續；　統一配給組織；　研究及調整家用燃料等。因之上海煤斤統制配給機構，形成如次體系：</p>
<p>此外在第一區公署之下，有煤斤統制委員會，主持核准發給許可證事務。在商統會之下，又有煤業同業聯合會的組織，以煤號業和煤球業爲會員，　煤斤的統制配給，亦有連帶關業。</p>
<p>四　最近煤球恐慌發展之經過</p>
<p>以上爲本市煤斤供需和其統制配給的概況。因近年以來一切由友邦人士主持，所以煤斤的運輸，均能按時到達，公平配給，因之如煤球的供應，很是圓滑　價格亦很是合理，可是最近幾個月來，（自十月份起）煤球現貨的供應，一天天的減少，人民的恐慌，一天天的增加，當局雖然發表負責的言論，希望安定人心，可是事實昭示，煤球的恐慌，非但不見消除，而更變本加厲，引起人民購的心理，官價煤球，雖然已自三十二元五角一担，提高到四十八元，可是黑市價格，連日高翔，漫無止境，對於市民生存的威脅，可說嚴重化至極點，如不從速講求對策，眞有不可終日之勢，而其形勢之兇猛，非但駕乎米糧之上，而且因煤球恐慌的發動，引起其餘物價的上漲。據十月三十一日申報所載：「此次煤球瀘爾發生缺貨現象，約有下列三大原因：　製造廠藉口成本高昂，要求酌增售價，終被當局拒絕接受，故減低生產量。　經售商因車得現貨有限，反之去路暢旺，同時所定利潤不敷開支，爰向黑市出售，冀獲非法厚利。　煤屑來源稍減，及當局甫在調整配給機構，故各廠所得原料，不若過去充分。可謂一針見血之語。</p>
<p>五　撲滅煤球恐慌之我見</p>
<p>本年十一月六日申報國民論壇韋君大作「再論煤球利潤問題」以爲「此次煤球恐慌，其主因實由於當局之減配煤屑。根據石炭聯合會配給數量：本年上半年與下半年四個月中之平均配給數，幾成三與一之比，而七，八兩月，與九，十兩月之配給量，又成一·五，與一之比，試問際此煤球日盛之旺月，廠商得此稀少之原料，安得不起恐慌乎？韋君想係業中人，所言定確而有據；乃係此次煤球恐慌　結所在，無人可以反對。惟作者根據歷年海關煤斤輸入統計，和每年的消費量相比較（均見前表），即令一九三七年前，供求相抵，而自一九三八年起至一九四一年止，歷年餘煤，當在六七百萬公噸左右，以上海人士目光的遠大，經營的得法，决無各貨國積，獨置煤斤於不　的理由，除了工商行號各自儲藏備用外，煤球煤業存儲的數量，亦一定可觀，張一凡先生的調查，以爲兩共積存三萬三千公噸左右（見中國工業月刋第六期三一頁），而作者的見解，以爲即在煤慌的今日，上海存煤，至少當十百十倍於此數。祇以平時由石炭聯合會按期配給，而且數量又相當充沛，所以無法掀風作浪，祗可眼看他人發財，而搖頭嘆氣，如今抓住配給減少的機會，一定要大大地利用一下，所以風潮會擴大得如此的大呀！作者撲滅煤球恐慌的對策，可從　積極與　消極兩方面來講示：　積極方面又可分爲下列四點來討論：</p>
<p>甲疏通來源　煤斤的來源，如果能够暢通，煤斤的配給，如其沒有缺少，則煤球廠商，無所藉口，而煤球的供應，也可以充分了。由於戰爭的影響，運輸工具的短少，當局要完成此項任務，當然有不少困難，但是應知燃料做關民食，不可一日或缺，而他影響的重大，亦出乎任何意料之外，務望當局設法打開僵局，增加生產，疏通來源，以求民生的安定。</p>
<p>乙調查存貨　如其根據海關歷年輸入煤斤數量，和歷年消費數量比較，則上海煤斤，應有大量的存儲，即令來源不暢，也可利用存貨，安渡難關。決不應發生恐慌，即令恐慌，亦不應如今日的嚴重，此點務請當局澈查辦理，以安民心。</p>
<p>丙取締黑市　上海煤球，雖說要依照官價購買十斤五斤，雖於登天，可是祗須鈔票充足，要向黑市搜購一噸兩噸，易於反掌，如說煤球眞個缺少，則黑市煤球，又從何而來。而且煤球不比米糧，除煤球廠商可以居奇外，四鄉並無出品，當前恐慌，不是商人爲利，　顧法令，　難找其他理由。此點務望當局破除情面，力加取締，嚴加懲處，不但煤球恐慌可以平息，其他物價亦可因之下跌！</p>
<p>丁調整利潤　煤球廠商所關心的，爲利潤的厚薄。茍其各項商品利潤，多已提增，而煤球廠商的利潤獨薄，一定招致他們的不滿，如其提出要求無效，一定要設法報復。</p>
<p>消極方面　亦可分爲下列五點來討論：</p>
<p>甲節約消費　戰爭時期，一切物資，以供應前方的需要爲第一義；即令物資有餘，亦應　節備用，何況煤斤來源不　，煤球恐慌日甚的今日，對於煤球的消費，人民務應在無可設法之中，再行設法，使得供需可以調節，而渡過當前難關。</p>
<p>乙　利用代替品　煤球的消費量，雖說已經　節到無可再行　節的地方，但是煤球的供應量，仍舊不敷在此種環境下，人們總得先要求果腹，而後再爲國家效力，在這樣情形下，利用其他代替品，以爲燃料，亦是無法中這一法，諸如山柴，豆柴，木炭，柴板，固然多可應用，就是舊報紙浸透後，撕成紙條，加上煤屑，搓之成團，功效尤爲卓著，上海的人們，不妨一試。</p>
<p>丙煤爐公用　這亦是無辦法中之一法，而且實行時，人們一定感覺許多不方便，可是如其煤球眞個不敷，爲勉渡當前難關計，祇可集合志同道合者數家，合居同炊，無論菜，飯，茶水，均利用同一煤爐舉火，對於煤球的節約，一定可以發生偉大的功效！</p>
<p>戊消滅人民爭購心理　祇須市場　謠紛紜，杯弓蛇影，相　伯有，人民多購若干，未雨預防，則平衡之供需，立即發生裂縫。此次煤球恐慌，亦有此等現象，在富有先購者，方沾沾自喜，而在貧困無力者，則　　以悲，不得不勉力設法，凡此現象，均墮入煤球廠商　中，而爲其所欺，供其利用，如能按照寻常情形，心理毫不恐慌，购买亦不恐后，即令煤球有缺货现象，决不至如今日的購買，如何愷切曉喻，使人民知道爭購的害處，似乎當局應該設法開導，人民亦應有自知之明的！</p>

<h3 id="c50">現階段的民生問題 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 王雄華</p>
<p>民生問題演變到最近的階段，巳到了十分嚴重的時候。一方面人人喘息於物價的重壓，一方面人人恐慌於物資的斷絕。由物價方面說：主要的課題是怎樣去　　通貨。由物資方面說；主要的　題是怎樣去改善統制。假若能把　　這兩個問題的核心而加以妥善的處　，那末整個民生問題，大體已得到答案。其他　節問題，都可迎刃而解。由以往政府的措置觀察，似乎始終沒有注意到民生問題根本　結之所在，而專門在限制價格，防止囤積等枝節問題上用功夫。倘使幣値穩定，價格不限而自限；倘使物資　暢，囤積不防而自防。這種捨本齊末的處置，徒然引起社會的紛擾，人心的不安。結果限價一再逾越，囤積仍然流行。假若民生問題，再不能作　本淸源的計劃，那末民衆的生活，固然日益州苦，而對於現政府的信任心，也將動搖。就現在的環境而言，想解决民生問題，必須取得日本的援助；日本又應當以什麼態度，什麼方式，來幫助中國解决當前的民生問題呢？下文就民生問題癥結所在的通貨問題，統制問題，以及其他問題分別加以檢討。日本方面應有的態度及援助，也在討論之列。</p>
<p>一、通貨問題</p>
<p>通貨問題的範圍，信用通貨也包括在內。據上海商業儲蓄銀行發表的營業報吿所說，到最近十月底止，銀行已增至一百六十七家，錢莊一百六十九家。金融業是以授受信用為業務，那末這些家銀錢業者，已經把信用膨脹到如何程度？對於物價又有何等刺激？這似乎大可玩味的問題。當局也許已經注意到這點，三令五申地限制小銀行的設立，但是成效如何？或者有不得不令人懷疑的了。進一步言：通貨的數量不僅限於現鈔及信用通貨之和，它的周轉率，有最大的决定作用。在這物價狂漲，投機猖獗的時侯，通貨的授受當然非常頻繁。由通貨周轉率的立塲而論：假定一定期間內十萬元通貨作拾次交易媒介，那末在通貨數量上等於一百萬元的通貨。所以不獨通貨中現鈔數量膨脹，可以刺激物價，信用通貨以及通貨的周轉率更能於無形中刺激物價。民國三十一年五月間中儲券一抵二的行為，僅僅注意在現鈔的數量上，所見未免太狹，其後果如何？已是有目共睹的了。</p>
<p>在戰爭時期，膨脹通貨以換取人力及物資，已是無能避免的行為。在通貨膨脹之後，怎樣去使物價恢復原來的平衡？不外兩種方法：第一種是增加物資，使物資隨通貨而增加，這樣通貨與物資之間可以維持原來的比例，物價可以不漲。第二種是設法將膨脹部分的通貨收回，使通貨與物資之間維持原有的比例，物價也可以不漲。戰爭期間，希望增加物資，以為抑平物價的手段，那一定失望多於希望。祗有第二種辦法，在通貨一度膨脹之後，作最大努力的收回。假若一度把通貨膨脹之後，不能將被膨脹部分收回，那末物資在對比之下減少，而物價反漲。在第二次徵用人力及物資的時侯，一定須出更多的通貨以為代價。假設長期間無適宜方法收縮被膨脹的通貨，變成通貨與物價互為因果，互相刺激的現象。結果非至不可收拾不止。九一八事變前張作霖在關外時代，他膨脹通貨（指當時奉票　）換取農產物，一面又以農產物運到外國換回軍火。這樣周而復始，農產物越收越少，奉票越發越多，奉票越多農產物越貴，農產物越貴越發奉票。到九一八時候，一度以現洋一元換八十元　票的黑市。這可說是能發不能收的前例。這個例子比於目今情形，固然比擬於不倫，但是能發不能收一點，大可為後人借鏡罷！</p>
<p>目今通貨問題的癥結：第一是通貨沒有明確的保證。僅憑政府的信用，還不能引起人民的信賴，第二是信用通貨部分，周轉速率部分，暗地刺激物價，不能作有效的抑制。第三是沒有有效的方法，使通貨收縮。第一點是基本問題，在現階段情形下，可說無法解决。假若說設法與日圓發生聯繫，那末日本華北間的物資交流情形與日本華中間大不相同，似乎難以仿照華北辦法。第二點方面，我們不能不要求政府嚴厲制止金融性企業的創設，對於已設立的金融事業，嚴格限制其活動。關於這點，中國聯合準備銀行對於華北金融事業，已經有有效的管理，大可作為借鏡。第三點方面，在積極方面收回通貨，當然有種種困難，在消極方面減輕通貨數量上的壓力，似乎不無可能。中國尙不直接介入戰爭，在軍費政費上盡可能地撙節，或者也是減低通貨數量的有效辦法。我們時常奇怪這些重床疊架的機關，左枝右節的組織，他們除了虛　國幣之外，究竟對於國計民生，有些什麽裨補？國家的政治經濟以及其他一切有無辦法，决不是添設機關所能解决的。現在國家財政，是向什麽路途前進，已經無須加以說明，與其養着許多冗員，何如大刀闊斧的減政？對於通貨壓力，多少可以減輕一些。</p>
<p>二　統制問題</p>
<p>現在似乎人人喜歡侈談統制經濟，把自由經濟，恨不能一脚踢出十萬八千里。統制經濟與自由經濟的優劣比較，那是另外間題。但是統制經濟，是否適合於中國的國民性？這點似乎沒有人注意到。外國人不了解中國的國民性，倡言統制經濟，自　情有可原；中國當局，也忘了本國的國民性，去隨聲附和地雷同統制經濟，眞令人大惑不解了。中國的傳統國民性，可說是最愛好自由的民族。這裏所謂自由，它的涵義是任性，適意，不受拘束。歷史上有許多隱逸高士，他們不肯出仕當世，並不一定因為君昏世亂，而主要的原因，因為做了官，便受管。所謂官者管也。失去了他們任性適意的生活。陶淵明不肯為五斗米折腰，所以逃官歸農，做了一篇「歸去來兮」的千古名文。自由主義的思想，不獨士大夫階級是浸淫其中，就是其餘一般人民，也是薰染有素。中國人的不管閑事，不守時刻，不講秩序，都可說長時期自由主義生活所養成的陰暗面。政治經濟方面，也側重自由放任，所謂「我端拱而天下治」。歷史上越是更張多端的時候，越是造成紛亂。例如宋朝王安石的新法，由純粹的法治精神觀察，當然不可厚非；但是法治精神與傳統的自由放任，根本發生抵觸，結果物　沸騰，新法無效。所以中國的傳統吏治精神，以政淸刑簡為美談。假期不能理解中國的國民性，而一古腦把日本行之有效的統制方法，搬到中國來依樣畫葫蘆；那末一方面不過為貪官汚吏開生財大道，一方面徒然增長民衆的惡感。我們看見穿着制服的人攔街討賣路錢，又看見配給物品的延期尅扣；不禁感歎到「統制！統制！中國萬般罪惡，皆假汝之名而行之！」</p>
<p>日本現在正與英美决生死存亡的時候，我們劈開過往的恩怨不談，在種族的地理的立塲上，當然須給予相常的援助。但是這種援助有一個原則：就是「取其所需，任其所餘。」日本究竟需要些什麽物資？又需要多少？不論統制收買也罷，自由收買也罷，中國儘可能地供應。除此之外，一任中國商人自由運銷，自由販賣。進一步言：日本不需要的物資，一任自由買賣。統制固然不必，配給更屬多事。近年以來，統制配給等名詞，早已令人望而生畏。統制經濟，自有它理論上的價値，但是有治法而無治人，徒然變成掛羊頭賣狗肉的勾當。假設行之失當，那成功了弄火者反被火焚，中日當局，似乎都應該小心些了。</p>
<p>統制問題附帶着南北物資交流的問題。最近物價暴漲，由於煤價陡漲。煤價的上漲；由於來源缺乏。但是華北煤產，確供日本及華北而有餘，惟其不能自由運銷，所以南來艱難。反而言之，華中的食糧，也在同樣理由下不能北運。華北鬧着糧荒而華中鬧着煤荒；强把中國區分為若幹政治的經濟的區械，又用統制的幣制的壁壘阻隔起來這是否合於中國一般人的志願呢？這種政策，中國人民又發生什麽印象呢？日本的賢明當局，似乎大可一再考慮了。現在蘇淮地區已經實施聯銀券中儲券同時流通，華北華中的匯兌阻滯，早巳為商旅所詬病。聯銀券中儲券之間，旣已確定了十八與一百的兌換比例，可否以之作為匯兌比價呢？假若無限制匯兌，勢必影響聯銀券的流通數量，那末對於正當商人，可否給予極寬容的申請匯兌呢？在民生問題嚴重到極點的階段，華中華北間的物資交流以及通匯問題，亟應加以考慮了。</p>
<p>三　其他問題</p>
<p>中日間題演變到現在，决不是諱疾忌醫的時侯了。假若中日糾紛不能在世界戰爭了結以前得到合理的解决，那末不論日本在世界戰爭中的勝負如何，中日糾紛必將繼續不已。謀中國問題的解决，第一應當看淸什麽人是中國的中堅分子，進一步去適應他們的思想願望。中國的中堅分子，除了知識分子之外，可說是資產階級了。這些資產階級的分子，有些是由軍閥官僚蛻變，有些是地主商人造成。三十年來的戰亂頻仍，他們一致的感覺是農業資本或土地資本，巳經不適於時代。他們夢寐企求的是中國急速地現代產業化，把他們資本安置在現代產業化的基礎上。中日事變以來，日本已否能够把握着中國資產階級的　　而加以適應呢？日本在和平區內種種措置，是否使中國資產階級感覺到不是阻碍中國的現代產業化呢？中國的國民性是極重視私有財產的，凡是妨碍他們私有財產發展的舉動，都在　惡之列，那末一切管理也罷，統制也罷，合作也罷，借用也罷，在中國民衆發生一種什麽印象，似乎大有檢討的必要了。進一步言：日本在　許多國策公司，是否不被中國民衆與東印度公司等量齊觀呢？這些問題，似乎是近於理論方面，然而在解决中國的民生問題上，也佔相當的比重。由解决中日問題方面說，可說佔着絕對的重要地位。</p>
<p>在現在環境之下，中國想解决當前的民生問題，當然非有日本協力不可。為中日兩民族永遠的利害設想，日本對中國的經濟政策，非有一百八十度的轉向不可。中國民族是最現實的民族不論外交辭　或宣傳文章，僅能引起撇嘴一笑。祇有切身的利害，能使他們感覺是恩是怨。日本假有把握着這點，及時援助中國穩定幣値，改善統制，撤退不必要的經營；那末當前的民生問題，固然昭蘇有望，即是對於民衆的印象，更非盟約或宣言可比擬。民衆普遍的好感，對於解决中日糾紛上，力量之偉大是更可不言而喩了。</p>
<p>總而言之：想解决當前的民生問題，必須嚴格管理通貨，縮小統制範圍。日本方面，尤應當把握着資產階級及一般民衆的願望，重新檢討他們的對華經濟政策。那末一切枝節問題，如配給啊，限價啊，都可迎刃而解。否則民生問題，勢必成為膏　之症。中日兩國賢明當局，應該及早回頭了。</p>
<p>從物質與精神兩方面</p>
<h3 id="c51">培養新生命 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 李永燦</p>
<p>宇宙間形形色色的一切現象，可以歸納到兩條定律：一是保持性的物質與能力不減；一是演變性的新陳代謝。戰爭·衰竭·和平·休養·生息·興盛·這世代交替，可以用新陳代謝來解說，更可以用近數百年內的歷史來證實。但是要得到和平，要得到勝利的和平，要促進和平後國勢的强盛，非得不滅的物質，和不滅的能力，繼續不斷的掙扎和努力不興。而目前最嚴重的民生問題，貧病交迫的癥結所在，和其補救辦法，當推首要之務。</p>
<p>過去一年，我們無論從文化，政治，經濟，尤其人民生活等各方面著眼，都可以看一切失了活氣。肆暴者逞其攫搏，假威者恣其爪牙，更兼商人重利，囤積投機，無所不為。結果流民載道，哀鴻遍地，更進一步倒行逆施，作奸犯科。這種紛亂痛苦的現象，街頭巷尾，都可見到。另一方面，一部份「因時制宜」的豪傑，在累資巨萬以後，縱情聲色，支持着各大娛樂塲所。可是　管歌台，舞榭，妓院，賭窟，無不車水馬龍，利市百倍。但是這種不正常的營業，非但不足以遮蔽社會的黑暗，相反地更暴露了人類的罪惡。要矯正這反常狀態，一方面我們熱忱期待着有力的長官，修明的政治；另一方面我們當與政敎同步，促進整個民族的自我覺醒。</p>
<p>講到目前的民生問題，最感威脅的，不外衣食住行四種。其中尤以糧食一行，最為嚴重。鮮衣美食，那談不到；足衣足食，也不希望；我們所要討論的是，怎樣解决數百萬市民最低限度的大布禦寒，紅米療　，安居樂業，通行無阻等基本問題而已。茲以開源節流為原則，將有待於政府的補救辦法，　陳於後：</p>
<p>暢運輸以均有無　興實業以闢利源</p>
<p>查上海貿易品，集全國的物產。贛，皖，湘，鄂，的油漆，藥材，竹，木，磁器；華北各省的棉，麻，小麥，皮革，烟草，煤，荳，玉蜀黍，高　；兩粵，閩，浙，的鹽，砂糖，水菓，海產；蘇，浙，皖，閩，的絲，茶，米，棉，紙料，蔬菜等。遠者來自數千里，需時月餘；近者亦來自數百里外。道途旣長，在此戎馬倉皇之際，險阻又多，同時上海的棉，麻，毛，絲，等織物；麵粉，五金，機器，捲烟，等商品，亦不能維持正常的輸出。貨物停滯，金融奇　，外加不法商人利用時機，　　市塲。生產求其維持原狀，已不可能，當然談不上增加了。要解决這問題，先須將各地貨物的生產及消耗數量，存貨總額，尅期淸查。再由國家管理運輸事宜，增設交通工具，開闢新路綫，掃除沿途一切障礙，維持各地供求。商人在政府指導之下，給以相當利潤，辦理配給。配給數量，當使人民　堪溫飽，私人經商及奢侈品買賣，　科以重稅。假使有錢階級，要過較舒適的生活，可出重價向該項商店購買。在運輸事業得到妥善解决　，人民生活　安，進一步我們要討論基本問題，怎樣增加日用品及輕工業的生產總量。茲分段略述於下：</p>
<p>（甲）農業問題　農業是一切日用品的根源，因此改良農村，是値得注意的。搜羅人材，考察各地土壤，肥料，氣候，雨量，及種子，以考察的結果，審定各地應種何種植物，用何種肥料，再硏究農具灌溉的改良，各種天災的禦防，及收穫後貯藏的改善，減少蟲傷腐爛等損失。這樣辦來，雖然略　迂　，但能加緊工作的話，不消二年，成績立顯。</p>
<p>（乙）工業問題　現在全國工廠，差不多全在半停工狀態中。政府毅然統制紗布交易，這是人民無不額手稱慶的。所遺憾者，就是沒有善後辦法，對於這些工廠，沒有利用。我們希望不但紗布要統制，其他如燃料，麺粉，化工原料，礦冶，水泥，電力，機械，電機等工廠，都由政府接管。更希望以迅速的手段，聘請專家，着意改精。無論質與量，都須有計劃的求其猛進。行有餘力，可以按照　總理的建國大綱，建國方略，在適當的地點，興辦新工業。同時各廠必須維持連絡，以增加生產效力。這種事業的設計，建造，當然不是容易的事，但是國家要復興，民生要充裕，這是不可逃的　徑。</p>
<p>（丙）敎育問題　關於學科方面，我以為在專科大學以上，當着重搜羅及介紹他國文化，原理的透視，技術的　練，培養實際的專門人材。中等學校除敎授各種基本學科外，當灌輸戰時敎育，實行公民訓練。女校最好能附設救擴課程，及家庭工作的實習。小學校宜注重思想訓練，及體格鍛練。使小學生在思想的出發點上，不至走入歧途，同時養成他們每天早操的習慣。這幾點在公立學校或者還能辦到，但私立學校呢？不要以為優秀分子的培養，不　其他問題那樣急迫，要曉得現社會的所以如此混亂，人格墮落是最主要的原因，試問讀者諸君誰能擋得起是一個「無愧於國的起碼公民」，有功更談不到了。關於敎師的待遇，那是誰都明瞭的，據說各校兼課，課後又任家庭敎師，每星期有多至七十二小時的敎師，每天平均十二時，外加趕東趕西，忙得惴不過氣來。這樣不但減低敎育的效能，還降低敎師的地位。補救辦法，除國家津貼，及檢舉不法學商外，別無良策。否則長此以往，敎育的前途，眞是難以想象。</p>
<p>至於住與行的問題，現在雖然相當嚴重，但在衣食問題能解决以後，盜賊消弭，流民絕跡，二房東不再賴房金收入維持生活，我們也不再高歎「蜀道難」，「長安居，大不易」了。</p>
<p>戒游惰以厚生計　敎儉樸以節財流</p>
<p>誰都知道，要解决民生問題，單靠開源是不濟事的，開源之外，還必輔以節流。所謂戒游惰和敎儉樸，雖然似嫌空洞，却是節流必然的着手處。從「聖誕夜化一百念元的代價，飮咖啡茶一杯」為觀點，便可測知有錢階級們的窮奢極侈，已經到何種程度。人的慾望是沒有止境的；鮮衣美食是人人都希望的；任意揮霍馴至財散身亡，不可救藥，也是誰都明瞭的；但是為什麽一食萬金，一衣數萬金，成為不足為奇的事實呢，原因很簡單，就是因為某種矛盾的心理，擾亂了整個市民的神經。所謂矛盾的心理，就是「對於將來的懷疑」。明天會發生什麽事變，誰也不能預測，而生活　數的日高一日，是拿得定的。錢！錢錢藏起來沒有什麽益處，今年聖誕節化一百念元可以飮咖啡一杯，說不定明年此日，連白開水都喝不到。還是今日有酒今日醉，明天柴米再商量吧！要不得！假使讓這種趨向極端的反常思想，繼續蔓延的話。要挽回頹勢，　壁上的「鮮衣美食君子之恥」是沒有多大效力的。在上者的一舉一動，為人民視聽所聲，儉風　於上民，氣動於下，「國奢示之以儉」那是第一步。培養人民的希望心，競爭心，不要使懷才莫遇，而目不識丁之徒，靠了三不關（國不關，民不關，名譽亦不關）的投機手腕，反而趾高氣揚，灰志士之心，短英雄之氣，這是第二點。提倡正當娛樂，如運動會，音樂會，各種手藝競賽，公開獎勵各業發表意見及計劃等。儘量利用業餘時間，這是第三步。絕對禁止賭博，試看賭塲隔壁，當舖接連十數家，便知賭博實是萬惡淵藪，非禁絕不可，這是第四步。總之，所謂節流，不單是財貨，即時間亦不使有一分一秒的虛擲。</p>
<p>立威信以孚民望　明吏治以整紀綱</p>
<p>這兩點是政治問題似乎與民生無關。但是政府是人民組織的機構，對內用以管理人民，對外用以代表國家。所以政府的措施，與人民的生計，同樣有著切虜的關係。令出不行，或約言無信，足以減弱人民對於政府的威望。試舉二例：為了解决市民的衣食問題，所以有糧食及日用品配給的組織。近來自紗布統制煤球斷貨以後，這兩種必需品，亦有配給的可能，這是每個市民都引領厚望的。不過已往的事實，吿訴我們所謂配給，所謂限價，反而促進非法黑市的滋長。在他國用為適應戰時環境的良策，在我國適得其反。米統會經過三度改組，結果每况愈下。在第三度接管以後，主管人員似有「目前存貨無多，待至十一月初，新貨上市，必有足量食品配給市民，價格必須略昻。」等說。結果如何呢？前些時，政府曾乘派大員調查市况，結果　興而來，悄然而去，上海依舊是如此的上海。這種類似的事實，眞是舉不勝舉。諺云「信立於上，民自孚之」。官可不做，而職務不可玩忽，威信不可喪失。　狐直書「　　弒其君」，傳為良史。反之一旦失信，而用浮文末法，籠絡世人。國家的前途，眞是不堪設想。所以我希望政府能毅然决然，以長槍大矛的姿態，快刀斷　的手術，肅正綱紀。其具體辦法，當從澄淸吏治，戒貪官，汰冗員，節公費，三點着手。</p>
<p>現在大多數的公務員，可以為「胡行」與「不行」兩種。「胡行」使社會向錯誤的方向進行，使人民陷於更苦痛的境地。這種行政人員，非但不足以管理人民，竟可以稱之為民賊。同時還減少人民對於政府的信仰。為人民計，為政府計，是值得澈查嚴辦的。「不行」使混亂的狀况，繼續延長；使舊的環境，不能打破，使國家的公款，無為的消耗。同時減低行政的效率，希望政府能秉公裁減。至於新官上任，舊官往還，歡迎啦！慶祝啦！假使不傷國體的話，儘可以減省。在上者能這樣以身作則，敎民節儉，非但可以省却一筆靡費，還可以化民成俗呢！</p>
<p>綜上所述六點，不過略舉大端，其他細則，眞是筆不勝書。總之光明燦爛的新生命，不是毫無代價的倖獲。必須動員全副精神，時間，和物質，從解决民生問題，增加生產着手。要增加生產，雖然運輸問題（或商業問題）屬最初步，但是當以農工問題為根本；政敎問題為動力；再輔以勤儉，人格修養，精神訓練，可以收功。</p>
<h3 id="c52">從統制物資說到如何改善民生 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— 王乃觀</p>
<p>統制的意義</p>
<p>「統制物資」是現代每個交戰國家，應付緊急的一種政策。其整個作用，在消極方面，是限制消費，節省物資，和平抑物價。在積極方面，是企圖利用由節省得來的物資和勞働力，來加强戰時所必需的生產工作。所以一個健全的統制制度，必能發揮上述兩方面的作用的，但是現在我們的統制制度，在消極方面的作用能發揮出來，已屬萬幸。至於積極方面的作用，現在還談不上。</p>
<p>今日統制的情形</p>
<p>今日物價的狂漲，黑市的存在，走私的活躍，吿訴我們「統制」是失敗了，今日統制物資的所以失敗，不是統制制度的不良而是統制物資之實施未妥。統制物資之實施所以未妥，不是統制物資的網領辦法等的不完善，而是負責者沒有决心毅力為民服務的精神，所以要改善今日的民生不是能不能的問題，而是為不為的問題，澈底的說，今日民生的不得解决，是負責者的，「不為也，非不能也」，在觀今日統制物資的癥結所在，我們就可以知道了。</p>
<p>下列三點，雖不能說是今日民生不得解决的唯一原因，至少是我們不可忽視的地方：</p>
<p>供應和需求的不得調劑——舉事實來說，米在近四個月來，配給的戶口米祗有八期八升，八升米來維持四個月是不够的，因此在事實上人民不得不仰給於黑市，最近黑市米價甚高，而產米區的生產者僅得八百餘元一石，論理產米區的生產者應當快活了。但是不然，他們希望着上海便宜的（比較的）肥皂，布疋（黑市），香烟，洋燭，火柴等。我們何意知道他們需要這些呢？只要看單帮所帶的東西就知道了，單帮商帶到產米區的是這些日用品，而帶上來的是我們所需要的糧食，因為上海是工業區，出產的是這些日用品，而需要的是農產品，但因於統制的關係，物資的不得流通。所以在上海糧食就奇形的昻貴了，反之在農業區出產的是糧食，而缺乏的是日用品，亦因物資的不得流通，所以試農業區中，如肥皂每塊要三十餘元，在上海只要四五元的香烟，亦要十六七元一包，最起碼的洋布要四五十元一尺，至於顏料等工業用品（供給小城市用）更是昻貴了。由此可見，今日工業區與農業區的物價互高，不是眞正的缺乏物價，而是物資的不流通，這不能不說是統制機關的未盡其　，本來統制物資以不阻塞物資之流通為原則，蓋物資能流通則分配始能平均通暢，而供求之勢將得其平，則物價不會陡起陡落，而各地價値之高低亦不致太過懸殊，再說在戰時我們希望的是安定民生，而不奢望從此解决民生。</p>
<p>減少生產—在戰時我們需要努力生產，極對不應減少生產，增加生產本是統制物資的目的之一，而今日的統制制度非但沒有使生產增加，相反的盡其減少生產的能事，舉例來說，現時統制物資的機關，是利用特權在各農村以非常的低價，收買物資，往往使人民不特無利可圖，而反要虧本，這樣，自然不肯再努力增加生產了，事實上亦再沒有資本去加增生產了，所謂「　賤傷農」。</p>
<p>轉入第四版</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>但農民們把上好的白米作猪狗之食（事發生於江北），而市民們則食眞正的猪狗之食，在如此情形之下，農村因「　賤傷農」而　於減產，都市裏的許多工廠因配給食糧不够，或原料不　，而逼着　減工人，或減少開工日數，也正趨向減產，因各方減產的結果，物價又將上漲。</p>
<p>缺乏廉潔的負責者—本來統制機關是為國謀生存，為民謀幸福的機關，絕對不是營利的機關，但是據近來東京出版的經濟學者，說「他們往往濫用當局所賦予的特權，努力追求利潤」，這眞是有心人欲哭無淚的痛心事，而今日的負　者所以沒有决心毅力為民衆服務的精神，其原因不外下列兩點：</p>
<p>（甲）對今日政府的認識不夠　他們以為我今日為政根本談不上為國為民，老實說完全是為了解決自身的生活問題，不忠於國府，輕視國府，這些本是見仁見智或者立塲不同的問題，所謂「海　有逐臭之夫」，這不是民生問題，我們且不必說，但是他們却本其解決自身生活問題的目標，而大求利潤，苦的却是我們民衆，這是主觀的不願為民衆服務的原因。</p>
<p>（乙）沒有勇氣克服環境的阻力　當然我們不能說今日統制制度在客觀的環境是一無阻力的如有　多我們民衆所不能知道的阻力，甚至我們自己始終還沒有衷誠的和統制機關合作，所以一個負責者尤其吃力不討好，還不是安逸的利用其特權，求我大利來得好，這是客觀的不願為民衆服務的原因。</p>
<p>如何改善民生</p>
<p>要改善今日的民生，以管見所及有下列數點：</p>
<p>强化統制機構—要强化統制機構，務使其組織簡單，責任分明，例如最近米統會的負責人發表談話，說明配給責任在糧食調　委員會，運輸責任在華中米穀配給組合，米統會則責在採買，現在單以米一項來說，就有三個機關，所以今日配給行勸的遲慢，費用的浩大就是因為組織太複雜，因為組織太複雜的原故，當兩個機構彼此失去聯絡的時侯，整個統制工作因此完全停頓，還有一個弊病，就是責任不明彼此推托，因此我們希望全國最高的統制機關，最近將其所屬各機構，盡可能的使組織簡單，可以合併的盡量使之合併，可以取消的設法取消之，再把各責任用明令指定之。</p>
<p>改善配給的實施—要改善配給實施，唯一的原則是使物資不浪費一絲一毫，同時能維持消費者的最低需要，因此現在有兩個要求，一，準期與足量，像租界未收回時一樣，如果在萬不得已而不能準期或改質減量的時侯，請負責者公吿民衆其原因何在，二·使物　消費得當，今日我們市民節省到不是一個「人」的生活了，節省下來的物資却供給特殊階級去享樂，例如汽油，煤，電，糖等，因統制的關係用汽油的機器停止了，而省下來的汽油用在舞塲門口的汽車裏了，用煤，用電的工廠，減少開工日數了，而戲院，舞塲，還不是用煤在生火爐，電燈輝　到天明，藥用的糖衣，沒有了，咖啡館裏的糖還不是任君自用。</p>
<p>配給行動公開—我們希望當一期配給發表，同時將這配給的物資，被收買的價格，收買地點，收買日期，運輸費用，人事費田一等連同全市配給量一同發表，這樣可以避免中間人之剝削、而使生產者與消費者交受其惠。</p>
<p>人事需廉潔—我們希望負責者處處為民着想，不論立塲不同也好，仁智見解不同也好，我們人民是無辜的，希望負責者，「以不忍人之心」，來「行不忍人之政」，使我們自己的同胞不　不寒，如果有這種精神、則不論客觀的環境如何惡劣，憑着這種精神總能一一使之消滅，唯有許多負責者，欲使其潔身自愛，無異「與虎謀皮」，在不得巳而求消極的下策，我們希望司法當局，為維持法紀，保護人民利益起見，對賊民者，敗國者，我們要求設立嚴厲的臨時法，甚至用死刑也在所不惜，同時當局應絕對不存袒護之心，而稍　　假，雖然有許多舞幣者對之是相當棘手的，但是不能因人異而「法從之」。</p>
<p>我們希望盟邦協助—希望盟邦當局本其一貫的王道精神，竭力協助，使及早得到合理的民生，中國民生之幸，亦中日合作前途之幸。</p>
<p>人民自己應當負起責任　現在統制的失敗，我們人民自己也不是全無過處的、「兩耳唯與世事　」的態度是要不得的。因為餓死的是我們自己，凍死的也是我們自己，我們要加緊協助統制工作，使民生早日得以解決，同時對　民的機關，我們亦要盡力的揭　其舞弊和黑幕的情形，我們要救自己，還是要我們自己來救。</p>
<p>最後我們期望於國府的—在今日全面和平未完成之前、在民心未全歸的時候，行「仁政」是唯一之途，「黎民不　不寒、然而不王者、未之有也」，所調「哀怨莫大於困窮」，哀怨的民衆什麽偉大的理論，理想、他們都是不入耳的。</p>
<h3 id="c53">怎樣促進米糧增產 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>「民以食為天」為我國的古訓，足以表示米糧的重要性，考諸史乘，歷朝的叛亂，幾全與米糧有關，戰爭時期，米糧又是決定勝負的重要因素；在前次大戰中巳給予我人以極大的敎訓，所以說，米糧為日常生活所必需，每日每人都不可缺，而兵民都一致需要；否則不僅影響於社會的安危，又為軍事成敗的關鍵，是以戰時米糧問題，當為各方所注目。</p>
<p>處於戰時體制之下，增加生產，是為戰時經濟的惟一要素，盡現代的戰爭，是物質的戰爭，一面須戰爭，一面須建設，乃可供給軍需，安定民生，因此戰時生彥須增加，巳無庸諱言，其中尤以米糧的增產為最重要，實為刻不容緩的事，茲將促進米糧增產的大　，分述於下：</p>
<p>治安問題</p>
<p>民國以來，內亂外患，頻年不息，農村破產，一則外受列强的經濟侵略，一則內受封建殘餘勞力的摧殘，於是農民遭到無法安業之苦，生活不安定，當亦不能盡力於耕種，焉能增產，所以農村安寗，政治上軌道，農民才能安居而樂業。然後才可以談到恢復正常的生產，更然後才可以談到增加生產，所以政治修明，農民安居樂業，才是米糧增產的先决條件。</p>
<p>墾荒問題</p>
<p>我們耕地僅佔全面積百分之十五，荒地竟達十四萬萬以上，目下更因戰事，以致荒蕪更多，為了使每一寸土地都能盡其最大效用以期增加米糧生產起見，政府當局應令地主於一定時間內，恢復耕種，　限即由政府派人耕種，或代為　人耕種，俱不納地租，如此，則耕地增加，生產量也可步而上升，此外，在不必要的地方，應　為農塲，以資耕種，並減少烟草的產地。</p>
<p>機械問題</p>
<p>我國向來用人工耕田如果改用機械，在生產上至少增加數倍，平時，僱農為機械所代替，尙權農村失業的增加，目下在戰時，勞力正感缺乏，生產力又急需增加，正可推行機械耕種，不僅可節省勞力且可策進增產，近年來，蘇聯農產物的大量生產，得力於農業機械的使用，因為全國各地，廣設大規模的國營農塲及集體農塲，得使農業機械化，以科學化增加勞　的生產力，這一點値得我們倣效的</p>
<p>水利問題</p>
<p>水利工作，約可分為二種：即旱地與水地，倘二者對於水利方面，如有相當改良工作，方能使生產有所增加，治標的方法是築隄，浚修河道，以利排洩，並用機器抽水，以利　　，治本的方法是多種森林，以防水患；又能調和氣侯，使雨量不致缺乏，旱災可以減少，標本兼治，實為促進增產的要　。</p>
<p>農具問題</p>
<p>我國農民皆貧窮異常，兼以農村破產，更無力購買新式耕作農具，仍　數千年來的陳舊農具，焉能增產？，所以主　機關應置　新式簡易農具，如抽水機，播種機，刈草機，碾米機以及殺蟲噴霧器，殺蟲噴粉器等，設器具站於適當地點，專租借與當地農民共同使用，並派員予以指導，同時對於奮式農具，因地制宜，加以改良；對於耕作用的牛，應極力避免　用，加以保護，設法增加牛之產量。</p>
<p>種籽問題</p>
<p>據專家硏究所得，倘若用優良種籽，匪特可以增加　品之　，抑且可以提高產品之質，例如用優良種籽的稱，可以增加產量百分之五以上，小麥可增加百分之三十以上，所以主管機關，應以科學方法，徵集全國各地最優良的種籽，設立大規模育種塲繁殖，分別貸給農民，積極加以推廣，一九二五年，義大利厲行小麥運動，其目的在獎勵以料學的方法耕種改良品種，以促進產量的增加。</p>
<p>肥料問題</p>
<p>我國向來所用的肥料，是人和動物的糞料，以及腐壤的植物，在今日，此等肥料價格昻貴，甚至　無法購得。肥料缺乏，　使生產量不能充足，其實我國到處都有肥料的原料，亟須由政府機關，用科學方法，設廠自造化學肥料，以低格大量貸予農，以補人為肥料的不足。事實上，使用化學肥料，產最可增至百分之十五，或百分之五十五左右，於此可知，化學肥料，與米糧增產、有着密切的關係</p>
<p>蟲害問題</p>
<p>我國農民因不懂科學方法，無科學設備，致受　蟲毛蟲及其他害蟲等的損失，為數不少，那末政府當局，應倣效美國的辦法，每年費巨額金錢，設立昆蟲局一類的機關，加緊硏究撲殺及消減辦法：同時對於殺蟲藥劑，除蟲器具，砒酸石灰，亞砒酸鈣粉等殺蟲藥料等，應大　製造，以低　普遍供給農民，此外對於秕和野草（吸收田中的肥料，妨害稻的生長）應該用科學方法，把它們剷除，則日後收穫自豐。</p>
<p>土壤問題</p>
<p>土壤是米糧生產三大要素之一，他能堅固作物的根蒂，滋養作物的生育，推而至於作物的生存繁茂和產量品質等，都要看土壤的性質為轉移，所以土壤的分析和改良，實是當今的急務，</p>
<p>以上所述，都是在米糧增產上不可缺的，亟宜積極推進實行，尤以農村政治修明，秩序安寗，使農民安居樂業，　以科學方法，生產技術的改良，農村金融的調劑，則米糧生產，焉有不增加嗎？</p>
<h3 id="c54">中國農村建設之路 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 李仲謀</p>
<p>今日民生問題中最重要的，莫過於農村經濟之危機，中國以農立國，人民生活百分之八十直接從事農業，其餘百分之二十也得間接仰賴於農產。一旦農村經濟動搖，則整個國民經濟的危殆，勢所必至。本文重心，要在討論農村建設與民生之關係。以求得改進農村最切實最有效的途徑，藉而謀全國民生問題合理之解决。</p>
<p>農業方面</p>
<p>（土地）　農業的發展，幾全部建築在土地上。土地之與農業，猶工業之與工廠，不可須臾　。中國土地問題對農業的影響，不是數量多少；而在缺乏平均的分配及充分的利用。換言之，即為開發荒地，擴充耕田。</p>
<p>甲丈量　因全國度量衡的不一，各地丈量法參差無定。在統計土地上，極難得到精確數字。中國究竟有多少耕田，多少荒地，非經劃一的丈量後，是不會測知的。</p>
<p>乙登記　丈量澈底後，就要按實登記。然後才好進行土地整理的計劃。</p>
<p>丙整理　調查過的土地，農民可由密度濃的地方分散開來，成一種平均狀態。再各就本位，從事農作。比方旱田種麥，水田種稽，山地植林…，得使土地盡量利用。</p>
<p>（勞資）　農業有了土地，尙須大量的勞力與　沛的資金去推動。土地是死的，加上勞力，加上資金，才能有活的生產。在貧弱的中國，勞資改良事項殊多。然最要者，當由佃農與金融機關着手。</p>
<p>甲佃農　我國農民中，自耕農僅占百分之四十。此外多係佃森及半自耕農。是種半自耕農及佃農制度，對於經營農業，以與自耕農相較甚為不利。政府應　訂佃農條例，免除租主與佃戶間之糾紛。</p>
<p>乙資本　由國家設立農業放款機關，以信用的立塲，貸金於農民。因農民大多缺乏資本，地方又無良好金融機關可行撥借。致使農民力不從心。一俟能有此項機關設立，則農民享受長期低利之貸金，努力農墾。而漸可有獲得地產的機會，成為自耕農。</p>
<p>（技術）　從歷史上觀察，中國農業雖經相當時期演變。但農民墨守陳法，不知改良，到現在也沒有得到長足的進展。農產物收量旣薄，品質又極低劣。農業技術非加一番改革，不會有新的期待。</p>
<p>甲農具　工欲善其事，必先利其器，這是一句老話。二十世紀的物質文明，即在如何利用機器，代替人力；而求工作效率的向上。中國農具，除了祖先留下來的笨貨外，很少有人用現代精銳的機器從事農作。選造新農具，萬不可少。</p>
<p>乙品種　種籽的改良，很早就引起世人的注意。可是中國農家，向來不在乎這些。認為收獲的好壞，是天定而非人為。甚至為節省金錢，故意用不良種籽。無怪作物的品質，逐漸粗劣。但為振興農業計，種籽的改良，至為必要。</p>
<p>丙肥料　糞便充肥料，這是中國農業上特有的好方法。可是未免要苦了農民，天天去聞臭味。如果設法硏究一種潔凈些的肥田粉，至少於施肥時方便多多。</p>
<p>丁本苗　肥料品種經過選擇施種後，對本苗的培植與保護，也是極有益於農業。</p>
<p>（經營）　我國歷代農業，習慣相沿，多為單純式經營，且為自給自是經濟原則所　絆，與外界不甚發生關係。現在中外互市，交通便利。經營農業者，應有一種新趨勢；以發展其業務。即應依照交換經濟之原則及農業經濟學的理論，而為合理合法的經營。</p>
<p>甲試騐　　昔鼓吹農事改良，往往偏重一方。如稱作改良，　桑改良，或果樹栽培改良。分別觀察，分別試騐，而蹈分散式進行之弊。欲救此弊，非亟求一農塲之事業，為綜合式改良不可。務使互相關連，以收試騐上的成效。</p>
<p>乙推廣　按期籌開農產品展覽大會，對於各農村經營方法，無諭其已否改進。應設法運絡。以厚實力，而利觀摩。幷對獎勵金，補助金，以及試騐區等經費的支出，均有指定專款。</p>
<p>（組織）以往中國農業組織，正如一盤散沙，不請互助，不知團結。今後應以合作為中心，而謀信用生產消費的多利多惠。</p>
<p>甲合作　合作事業，乃農業組織所必須舉辦者。農業的改進，是由於多數利益的互相調和，而不是多數利益的互相衝突。合作事業的提倡與設立，可斟酌環境，指導進行，和設法兼營。</p>
<p>乙勸業　勸業不僅在求農業本身生產的增加，同時還要達到其他副業的加强。在嚴密的組織下，使舊有農業發展，新進農業普及。</p>
<p>農產方面</p>
<p>（品質）農產品的價値，端視其品質而定。這種以農民血汗爭取來的代價，無疑地，誰都期待着越高越善。不然的話，農業品質低劣，實是莫大損失。</p>
<p>甲標準　農產的品質，究竟以何種為最理想，最優秀，固應　定一適當標準。作硏究農產的根據。</p>
<p>乙等級　　定標準後，按造各種作物的品質，予以評別等級。好使農產物便於提高與改進。</p>
<p>（貯藏）　農產貯藏的得法與否，中國疏忽已久。致令收穫的作物，往往因保存不力，遭到意外的災害而腐敗。這樣，自然會使農產減少。</p>
<p>甲倉庫　收穫下來的作物，為要貯藏在倉庫中，這種倉庫的構造與設備，必須完善不可。注意事項，如通風，防潮……等，皆為必要。</p>
<p>乙消防　為防止農產物貯藏的提失，消防工作的設施，時時都要準備，以保護作物貯藏的安全</p>
<p>丙保險　這點，也與消防工作，對貯藏農產上有同樣重要，用防萬一。</p>
<p>（運輸）　中國交通不便，農產物的流通運輸，極感困難。南方的作物，不能與北方的作物互換。引起過剩或缺乏的不均現象。農產配送不圓滑，已為目前最大問題。</p>
<p>甲交通　開發鐵道，修築公路，使全國運輸取得密切連絡，農產品各地交流。</p>
<p>乙水利　我國河流，歴年失濬。淤沙堆積，不但失掉水運之利，甚切釀成泛濫遭災的殘象。築堤，造林，濬通支流，調節水量，都是當前急務</p>
<p>丙配送　為達到農產運輸目的，交通便利後，尙得顧及配送問題。亦即選擇各地農產品，照有無相通的原則，分往全國配送。</p>
<p>（售賣）　農產品運達一定目的地之後，接着就是售賣。售賣時的價格，市塲。都須合算始可。這是由物質而兌換金錢，然後由金錢再去產生物質</p>
<p>甲價格　價格的穩定，對農產品極有關通性。以往中國曾一度把農產品的價格，弄得很低。這當然使農民的血本耗盡，現在尤於戰爭，物質的缺乏，農產價格一天天飛漲起來。同樣，亦不是好的現象。平定物價，在農業生產上，誠為必要步驟。</p>
<p>乙市塲　農產售買的地方是靠市塲。但經過一般商人的重　利剝，售出雖極高昻，實際收人無幾。為避免此項事故，有組織公共農產品市塲的必要。</p>
<p>農民方面</p>
<p>（負担）　中國農民的負担，可以說比操任何職業的都要沈重。在賦稅上有田賦，强迫借貸，　契稅，農產品稅，以及其他特別稅捐。金錢負担如此，在身體上又要供給力役，甚至於有生命的犧牲。這些都是中國農民對國家所盡的義務。為使其負担減輕，得行使以下措施。</p>
<p>甲賦稅　農民除應納漕糧地畝正稅外，其餘無理之稅捐，設法酌量盡力減少。</p>
<p>乙服役　服役是人民對國家應盡的天職，不過一般土豪劣紳，　官軍閥，往往欺詐無知老農。勤　强抽壯丁，這實為絕對剷除的。</p>
<p>（敎育）農民知識淺陋，文化程度至低，以致阻碍新農業之進行，及新農村之繁盛。這都是夙由缺乏敎育的影響而來。普及農民敎育，為一切農業進行之根。</p>
<p>甲思想　了解自身職責，以及對國家觀念。激起農民的愛國心，而一掃過去不問國事，只顧吃穿的錯誤思想。全國農民，聯合自治起來。</p>
<p>乙科學　二十世紀的科學文明，應深輸於農民。用科學方法，求農業的改進。</p>
<p>丙風俗　近來生活程度日高，世俗漸尙奢侈。但無論如何，農民應保守固有儉樸的風氣。</p>
<p>丁識字　農民文盲太多，識字運動，亟宜全面展開。至少有閱讀報章雜誌的能力。</p>
<p>（治安）農民生活安定，首先要求治安的確保。治安一日不平定，農民生活亦一日不得安閑。年來戰爭結果，　火之餘，淸鄕工作，在所必需。</p>
<p>甲淸鄕　勵行保甲制度，人口調查，均須切實做到。使　禍不得逞。</p>
<p>乙　　　農民全副武裝，保衛自　的鄕土。警備的責任，人人皆有，組成自衛國，協力官軍工作。</p>
<p>（衛生）　人生之健康，不問農村住民或都市住民，同感重要。農民對於衛生上，就其自然環境與職業性質而論，雖占優良地位。然為經濟，物力所限，反不及都市住民遠甚。故應設法為之增進。</p>
<p>甲娛樂　正當的娛樂，可以休養農民疲乏的身心。如農民公共俱樂部，聯歡會，劇塲，音樂會……等娛樂塲所的　立。</p>
<p>乙體育　利用農耕餘暇，運動增長體力。可利用天然草塲及水池，練習球類或游泳。</p>
<p>（災害）　防止一切水旱，風，及病虫災害。</p>
<p>總之，中國至今　是一個農業國家。政治經濟，社會各方面的建設，要以農村發展為重大前題。建設中國農村，是　全國民衆　新的生路。</p>

<h3 id="c55">糧食統制及增產問題 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 郁英彪</p>
<p>一　戰時糧食問題之重要性</p>
<p>现時之戰爭，為總力持久戰，一國的勝負，不但須依賴着他軍事的優勢，同時對於其本國之資源，及一切經濟的潛在力，不無相當之關係，於是經濟攻勢，海上對鎖股等，亦被各國政府，視為擊潰張敵的戰策，而此種以利刃　人之背的戰略，實不亞於閃電攻勢呢！故而欲求國內態勞的平衡，軍需的充實，物實作戰的强化，以及使國內一切的物質毫無消　地完全利用，就不得不採取統制經濟的辦法，而糧食統制間題，尤為統制經濟中之主要民生物品，做若糧食問題能統制得當，則最後勝利，必可操諸左劵了。上次歐洲大戰發生後，德國在軍事上雖已佔到絕對的勝利，可是國內之人民，自」九一六年起，已遭遇飢　，蕪靑甜菜都被政府徵收為軍糧，小麥玉蜀　亦無從購處，是以德國雖再經過二年之奮戰，然因糧食之破產，終為協約國所屈服，由此吾們可見到·糧食問題在持久戰中之重要性，而常此東亞民族存亡之戰中，對於此民食攸關，軍納急需之糧食問題，實有一再檢討之必要。</p>
<p>二　參戰後之我國糧食問題</p>
<p>我國雖以農立國，可是因農事上之技術及制度等，不求改進，以致生產落後，每使本國之所產，常不足供本國人民之所需，在戰事未發生時，尙可仰給於國外，然自大東亞戰後，不但海上運輸困難，又須供應大量之軍需，致使我國之糧政受一重大打擊，故我國糧食問題之現狀，即為生產不足，消費不敷，與分配不均三種困苦，但苟若政府一方能努力從事糧食之增產，一方能運用圓活之統制政策，則糧食之自給必不為理想之事實，然二年於茲，政府對此重大之問題，尙無二兀善的方針，誠不勝遺憾，茲略將我國糧政之管理及弊端分述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）統制機構及人選　卅二年九月，米糧聯營社解散後，成立了米糧統制委員會，而米統會亦即糧食統制之最高機關，其重大之責任，足以左右我國經濟統制之前途，故其主要人選，皆經政府指定社會上素孚聲望之諸公辦理之，然上層機構雖組織健全，而下層機構難免良莠不齊，則上下隔閡，營私舞弊，走漏操縱等事在所不免，因之米糧統制未能達到圓滿之境界，黑市米價之益形猖獗，實有基於此，是以欲求糧政之進行順利，配合合理，則各機構之人選，實須調整之。</p>
<p>（乙）採辦徵收及運輸　過去糧食之採辦徵收，大都由統制當局和各產區之糧商，簽訂採辦合同，而由各地糧商再行入鄉收買，此種採辦方針，因欲使糧商等能順利進行收買工作，故常賦其種種特權，但糧商於收購之際，欲圖暴利，故常將政府所訂之法定價格，除其應得之利潤外，再行壓低若干，或籍詞恫嚇農民，或强制全部出售，同時農民方面，若欲將其所有或所餘之糧食，出售於採辦商，則因收買價格過低，而其半年辛苦所得之代價，僅足完糧納稅，因之每使大部農民引起反感，誤解政府統制收買之本意，而拒絕出售，故採辦徵收之未能靈活進行，亦基於此採辦之方針不完善。次之，為運輸問題，米統當局，對米糧運輸事先須有統盤之計畫，以求米糧配給能按期不誤，然最近米統當局，對配給之稽延，常推言運輸不便，而阪夫走卒之黑市米，則雖在四鄉僻處，仍能源源不絕供給民食，此種因運輸不能暢達，而有供應不及之病，亟盼主辦當局，澈底杜絕之。</p>
<p>（丙）配給數量及米質在米統會成立之初，會力言鑒於過去米糧統制配給之失敗，今後當極力設法革新，然創立於茲，已歷四月，雖聞有增加配給數量到二升半之說，但至今仍未實現，使升斗小民，不勝其苦，猶記最初戶口米之配給為七日一期，每期二升白米及麵粉二斤，後則逐漸減少，至米統會接辦之後，為十日一二日，則一期配給米，只够二日之舉炊，而其餘八日之食米，須取之於黑市，且最近之戶口米配給，常不準期配給，四月來祗有八升，若一旦黑市遭取締，則人民惟有束手待斃，故米統會旣不能統制採辦，配給足量，又欲消滅黑市，取締走私，因循自誤，徒苦民生，蓋米統會若能將配給數量提增，吏人民之所需合乎配給數量，則高價之黑市米當能不禁而自滅，而糧食之配給亦能趨於成功之途。至於米質方面，過去常有同期配給，而其米質從不一律，或為碎米，或為紅米及糙米等，此種不統一之米質，極易給配給商以弄巧之機會，收領杜米，而售出糙米，總之偷天換日，任其作為，致使人民在無形中蒙受極大之損失，故配給數量及米質實有改革之必要。</p>
<p>（丁）糧食增產近年我國人民，因迭受糧食恐慌之威脅，故對糧食增產問題漸覺為一燃眉之急的事務，而政府方面亦極力的提倡，如事變前所發動的國民經濟建設運動等。然歷年來我國之農村，頻遭天災人禍之摧殘，故農村經濟實已疲弊殆盡，又因農村資金，皆被都市吸收集中，故農民負債增高，於是大部農民，都拋棄田園，從鄉村轉向都市謀生，由於此種趨勢，結果又造成荒蕪地面積之增大，土地之集中於地主富豪，及生產收獲量之漸減，同時，都市方面亦因人口之激增，而形成糧食不足，於是食糧輸入增大，此數種連續發生之因果，構成了我國糧食恐慌的基礎，故今日之研究糧食增產者，誠有根本改革我國農村的必要。例如，在九月十五日召開之食糧增產策進會，及中央農具製造廠之劃歸建設部，最近在十二月十八日又有合作社會議之召集，以此種種，皆充分表現政府對高度糧食增產的决心，故此龐大之具體計劃，若能因循蹈序地進行，則此為當前急務之糧食問題，亦可因此而解决，且此後國家之百年大計，實亦有賴於此舉之成敗。</p>
<p>三　此後糧食問題之改進方針</p>
<p>（甲）統制機構及人選方面　糧食統制為一極困難之工作，尤其是人事間題，故欲求工作人員之弊絕風淸，則須嚴加督飭，明正賞罰，並訂定糧政人員之獎懲條律，使廉潔者有以所獎，營私者有以所儆。同時，希望米統會當局設置一吿密箱，使社會人士耳目所及，能隨時有所吿發。　現時米統會之高級人選，大都為本市著名之士，但對其他各地難免生疏隔閡，故希望最好能多將他處之糧商或聞人，延聘參加，則統制機構之活動，能更趨廣汎。同時，添聘經濟學家，以從事研究合理的配給制度。　辦理糧政人員，雖須潔身自好，但若月給薪俸，不足以安定其生計時，則執法如何之嚴，仍不免失職貪汚，故此後糧政人員之待遇，望當局能提高之。</p>
<p>（乙）採辦微收及運輸方面　　廢止以前商人承辦米糧徵收之方法，另設辦事處於各區而由各區縣長負監督之責任。　徵收時以村落為一供應單位，而辦事處須先調查其耕種面積，人口密度，及本年共收米穀若干担；再依其所有人口之多寡，耕種面積之大小，訂定該村之保有量，使農民能保持其自用之食糧，及來年之種籽，然後將實收量除去保有量及特別米，而此最後之數量，方為政府眞正所能徵收的數量。所謂特別米，就是讓農民妥為貯藏，以備年荒歲歉時，再作處分的米。　收買時之價格，必須除農民之成本外再加相當之利益，使無偏頗之弊，以養成農民能自動供應，樂於輸將的心理。所謂農民之成本，即為田租，肥料，種籽，人工，及每年之生活費等。　管理　輸，亦為糧食統制之一主要問題，若收買工作能　利進仃，而運輸不能暢達，則甲地之糧食過剩，乙地之糧食不足等現象，仍有重現之可能，故當局在糧食收買之前，須輿各運輸鑽關疏通，而使米糧之運翰，得享有各種煙先之權利，並令各辦事處負責防止途中走漏短少等情事。</p>
<p>（丙）配給數量及米質方面　　米糧之配給額，最低限度須維持居民之正當消費量為原則，務使高價之黑市米，絕跡於市塲中，則間接能影響百物之物價，而民生亦得賴此安定。　配給米之發售時期，應絕對準確，且按期不誤，使居民能信賴統制當局，而減少向黑市之購買量。　米質亦應統一，若不能完全統一時，須給與領得該項米糧之配給商一特殊之通吿，藉此標明該處所出售之米糧，究為何種米質，則米商之掉換取巧，皆能消滅。</p>
<p>（丁）糧食增產方面　　增加擴充耕地的面積及零細經營的革新—我國土地廣大，然耕地之面積極小，據民國二十六年美國農業部的調查，我國耕地當總面積之百分比為二。一，故若能將耕地面積擴充，則農產品即可大增，同時，將農家零細經營之田圃，强迫合併，集體經營，則大規模的耕作，便能實行，且辰家資本勞力，又能獲得經濟的利用，而增產的目的亦可漸漸達到，　改良穀麥品種及推廣優良品種—品種之優良，對於生產之收獲量有極大之關係，往往在同一環境下，優良品種之產量較他種為多，是以欲求產量之增加，則改良及推擴優良之榖麥品種，亦一重要之方針。　補充壯健耕牛及普遍推行新式農具的應用　近年我國耕牛一般的減少，考其原因，皆因農村疲弊，農家經濟力低下，而將耕牛賣却，但耕牛實為我國農業上不可缺少之役產，故耕牛補充在農家經濟上言，是一重要的問題。土地和農具同為農民所必需者，但我國多零細性的經營，大形的機械在所不需，故新式改良農具的應用，事半功倍，提高生產效率，實須推行。　水利之整頓—水害之發生，亦即我國農舉衰退之一重大原因，一九三一年的大水害發生，影響晨產品的損失額為四僚五千七百萬元，所以在此糧食增產聲中，整頓水利，亦為當前之急務。　合作寨業的組織—在農村再建的方策中，合作事業實是推進農民組織的機能，使農家經濟從中問商人的剝削，和高利貸的重圍中脫出，造成農業協同組合，使生產品能共同運銷消費品能共同購入，故合作事業在農村裹，可以說是絕對的需要。　開發都市農村—田園都市本為英國所提倡，當時提倡之本意為「救濟英國之時弊」，其實此舉不但使弊害多端的都市生活，一變而為淸新的田園生活，同時對墾殖荒廢土地，促進生產，不無相當之關係。</p>
<p>四　結語</p>
<p>以上所述，不過為糧食問題之現狀，及其改進之方針，但糧食問題在國民經濟方面旣有唇齒相切之關係，其所賴以推進之人力物力，亦無限量，政府固當盡主持推動之力量，而尤賴於全國國民對此重要問題，有衷誠協力之自覺，誠如申報社評所說：「統制經濟，在我國尙屬　舉，推進前途的順利與否，完全緊於民衆的認識與協力如何？而取得民衆的認識與協力，必先樹立統制經濟的信用。米糧統制，是統制經濟中主要的民生物品，尤須樹立信用。」則政府及統制機關，必須切實的負起責任，而人民方面則須節約消費，厲行生產，如此兩者兼顧並籌，則民族與民生，亦可達到平等與解放之願望矣。</p>
<h3 id="c56">改善房屋租賃的建議 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 陳愛芳</p>
<p>溯自「八一三」事變後，以各地居民咸受兵燹之禍殃，紛紛避居滬上，而滬上房屋遂釀成供不應求之勢。一般乘機取財之徙頓時利慾薰心，意圖獲得不法之利益，所謂頂費·小租·挖費等名目油然而生。凡房屋無諭由所有人（即大房東）租與承租人（即二房束）或由承租人轉租與第一次承租人以至於第二或第三次承租人（即三房客）時，均得自由收取鉅額之頂費或小租以遂其不法之所欲。於是勢之所趨，所有人壓榨承租人，而承租人再搜括次承租人，結果負担最朮者厥為次承租人，但後者為謀一時居住問題之解决，對於承租人種種苛酷條件祇得忍痛接受。刁頑之承租人往往向所有人頂得數幢房屋後，不僅可從中獲得鉅利與供一家之居住，且以按月收自次承租人之租金除應付所有人外，尙有盈餘足以維持一家之生活，是則彼不謀職業即得坐享不勞而獲之利益矣。凡所有人於戰前已將房屋租出而並無租賃期限者，則不僅無法收取頂費，抑且收自承租人之租金尙不敷支付水電與房地捐等費用，遂不得已要求承租人酌加租金以資　補，而承租人故意為難拒絕，即願酌加若干，仍不足以敷上開費用之支出，日久彼唯有藉口收同自用成翻浩房屋向法院對承租人提起遷讓並返還房屋之訴，苟無確　證據，訟經閱年，仍須遭法院之駁回，而其所付律師公費與訟費之代價，實屬不貲，一時垂頭喪氣，非可言喩，且甚而有以訴訟不能收回房屋或租金不得滿足以致負依纍纍者，久之遂有分幢或連同出售自己所住房屋之事實。所有人之敗訴，日後又無異增加承租人之保隙，而更可令其為所欲為，大肆野心矣。至於所有人無論在戰前或戰後租出之房屋，如定有期限者，則不患頂費之無着，設承租人不願支付其所索頂費之數額時，一俟租期屆滿，莫不依民法第四五〇條第一項：「租賃定有期限者，其租賃關係於期限屆滿時消滅」之規定，對承租人提起遷讓房屋之訴，斯則法院十之八九判决照准，惟為體念承租人之覓屋困難計，酌予數月之綏期履行期間耳。當時二特區法院之民事訢訟以房屋糾紛事件約佔百分之八十以上，法院以時值非常，遷讓非易，悉以保護承租人為原則，其中能深明大義而予以體恤所有者之承租人，實屬寥寥無幾，而所有人能體念承租人之苦衷者亦屬相同，遂致雙方不能諒解而處於敵對之地位，於是房屋糾紛事件，層出不窮，數年以來居住問題之嚴重，愈演愈烈。當局有鑒於斯，旋於民國三十二年五月十日公布施行「戰時房屋租賃特別法」，全文共計十八條，對於出租人與承租人雙方之利益均予兼顧，尤以於承租人者為甚，其意乃在保障平民之生活中心，　不致再有房屋糾紛事件之發生，以期適應戰時經濟之體系也。顧自半年以來，法院受理房屋訴訟之事件頓時減少　觀乎表面，房屋租賃之糾紛似己漸趨平定，然究乎實際，所有人以明知若自己之房屋出租後，將來必難予收回以供自用，而皆不願租出者，大有人在，即有願意出租者，亦無不利用眾租人覓屋之困難與需屋之急切，而索取鉅額之代價，凡承租人之經濟能力稍優者，必願予以接受，是特別法之施行實不啻釀成房屋所有人之居奇心理，因此當局雖一再申令禁止預費小租之收取，但於暗中依然猖狂，無法防止，平民需用房屋者，竟至不能問津，由是而諭，居住問題之嚴重性仍未消失也。推其　結，誠由於南局未實行澈底改善辦法所致，爰特不揣冒昧提出改進之芻議，願與賢明之士共同商　，而為當局實施之參考。挨今後改進房屋租賃之要點，應自消極與積極二方面同時進行，始能收其實效，茲分別閘明於後：</p>

<p>（甲）自消極上言，一則應檢點法律之本身有無窒碍難行之條文須加修改，或有無掛漏須解釋補充以濟其窮。二則應側重法律之切實執行問題，茲分論之。按法律為人類社會生活中，依據國家之權力而具有强制力之準則。觀乎近代一般國家之法律思想，民事訴訟以不千涉主義為原則；凡當事人無論違反民法上之强行規定或任意規定，設未訟爭至法院，即不致發生適用快律之問題，然一旦須得法院之公平裁判時，則非依公正之法律為準繩不為功，是以法律之有無瑕疵，亦屬不容忽視。此次當局公佈之「房屋租賃特別法」，原則上吾人固未可厚非，然細察全文，亦有應付諸磋商或補充者，茲擇其重要之點，縷陳如次：</p>
<h3 id="c59">房屋租賃法要點 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>一，按第十三條「已判令遷讓時，仍可保有最少二年猶豫期間之居住權利，如有特別情形，且可以請求延長，如是承租人即無處租約之終止，而儘可於二年或二年以上之期問內極盡壓迫交承租人或違反租賃契約故意為難出租人之能事，以遂其不法之利得，逍遙自在，莫甚於此，誠可謂房至租賃之一大　結。故欲遏止承租人之野心，俾出租人與次承租人之利益多得一重之保障，非將是項緩期遷讓　　　以縮短不可，是本　　規定，實有修改之必　　吾人認為是項緩期遷讓期間應改為最多不得逾一年，且即有特別情形，亦不得予以延長也。</p>
<p>二，按第十四條第一項「本法施行前已確定或宣吿假執行之判决，除呈經司法行政部准予停止執行外，應繼續執行之」之規定以觀，承租人於前條之猶豫期間內，尙得以受戰爭影響為理由，呈請當局停止執行，如蒙照准，則出租人徒耗鉅資而不能過訴訟終結之目的，是法院之判决實等於具文，不僅有背法律平等保護私權之本旨而顯失威信，且公然釀成承租人之優越地位，愈可使其變本加厲，獲得不法之利益。於是勢之所趨，有空屋之人必皆以出租房屋為畏途，寗願令其終年空閉，而不孔輕予租出矣。長此以往，滬上之居住問題，仍難望解决，是以本條關於「呈經司法行政部准予停止執行」一點，亟應予以刪除也。</p>
<p>三，目下一般房租之金額，不能與物價相比擬，而出租人依按月收入之租金，不敷支出水電捐稅等費用者，仍不乏其人。依本法第六條：「前五條之租金，如有增滅之必要，由當事人協議定之，協議不成，由法院判定之」之規定，無論為定期租賃或不定期租賃，出租人固因得情事之變遷，隨時請求承租人酌加租金，且依本法第七條之規定，法院判定租金，亦應使出租人於出租房屋所負担之一切費用外，獲有相當之利益。惟對於貧苦之承租人，如確不能負担加租之金額時，可否予以體恤，本法並無明文，吾人認為此時法院得斟酌其經濟上之實際狀况，加至出租人能所負担之一切費用為已足，但如出租人之經濟狀况優越者，法院得不准其加租，以安定民生，關於此點在法文方面，實有予以補充之必要。</p>
<p>四，本法第七條法文上之所謂「一切費用」，是否包含修繕費在內，實堪研究，依民法第四二九條第一項：「租賃物之修繕，除契約另有訂定或另有習慣外，由出租人負担」之規定，自應以有無特約或地方習慣以為斷。然際此非常之秋，本法第八條旣明定：「出租人或承租人除押租外，不得向承租人或次承租人收取小租，頂費，或其他類似性質之費用，但押租之收額不得超過十二個月租金之總額」，第九條又明定：「出租人或承租人遠反前條之規定者，除承租人或次承租人於本法施行後收取小租，頂費，或其他類似性質之費用，得依不當得利之規定，請求返還外，法院應科以三萬元以下之罰金」。則出租人或承租人出租或轉租房屋，不僅難得鉅利，且其收人之租金亦有限，尤以出租人之所得為最少，如修繕費不包含於本條之「一切費用」內，而由出租人負祖時，則承租人與次承租人非僅對於房屋不盡善良管理之責，恒有損壞，抑且有勾串修理工人虛報修理費用之處，俾出租人於租金中扣除是項費用外，一無所得，或甚而須向承租人另行找貼，是於出租人之利益，未免保護不週，而有碍房屋租賃之改善也。故吾人認為修繕費一項，應包含於本條之「一切費用」內，且為公平計，是項費用應依照承租人與次承租人所住房屋之面積，並斟酌各人之經濟狀况，比例分担之、是在法文方面，亦應補充及之，以免當事人之爭　也。</p>
<p>法律之本身，鞏固無疵後，尤應進而予以切實執行，始能收其實效，安定民生。故實掌執行法律之司法官，處此時間，其人品之是否廉潔公正，影響於房屋之租賃者，至深且大。欲使法官忠於職守，公正無私，非保障其生活與地位不為功。最近上海法院內法官凟職情事，時有所聞，此在倫理上，應歸咎於法官個人之操守，固屬無可諱言，而在實際上，法官往往以按月之薪俸，不敷供養全家之老幼，抑且於職務上偶一不愼，即受停職，免職，轉調，或減俸之處分，是法官之生活不得安定，地位不得保障，誠為釀成賣職之最大原因。故深望當局今後亟予改善法官之待遇，令其維持一家最低限度之生活·且賦予其地位上之特殊保障；非有法定原因，不得任意將其停職，免職，轉調，或減傣，俾「房屋租賃特別法」得以切實執行，平民之居住問題得以早日解决也。</p>
<h3 id="c60">推行實際工作 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>（乙）自積極上言，應確切推行有關房屋租賃之各項民生問題之實際工作，茲擇其要者析述於後：</p>
<p>一，肅淸各地不良份子：年來各地居民受土匪與地痞之騷擾要挾，以致不願久住本鄕，而遷居滬上者居十之八九，且甚而在滬上久住後，雖本鄕已稍趨安逸，得以居住，而在滬上所租之房屋仍不願退租，來往自在，究其原因，由於法律之特別保護承租人，固屬不容否認，而細察之，要以各地不肖未能澈底肅淸，使人民恐懼，不敢久留，實為其根本上之　結，故欲望今後居住問題之解决，非從事肅淸各地不良份子不可。此項工作之推行，一方面須多駐各地之保安隊，盡量予以新式之武器，一方面須側重各地負責長官之人選問題，而嚴加督促，令其以身作則，如有勾結常地不肖而殃民者，經審房屬實後，應即處以極刑，以儆效尤。如是地方必安謐如恒，而人民即得安居樂業矣</p>
<p>二，實行疏散本市居民：各地不良份子絕跡後，即須實行疏散居住於本市之外埠居民。此項工作之推行，一方面須詳查本市各區戶口，對於居民之本籍，職業，年齡，作一正確之統計。凡無相當職業之靑年，或少年，除應本市之人才需要外，一律促其回鄉；至老幼婦孺，更應疏散，自不待言。旅費一項由當局斟酌各人之經濟狀况，予以不同之優待。對於應疏散之人數酌定後，再定疏散之時期；按人數與交通工具之數量，分為若干期，每期人數與一期之期間，亦須酌定。每期疏散時，應由市政當局嚴厲執行，不得稍有玩忽。在另一方面，須改善水陸交通；如車票與輸船票黑市之防止，改善執行交通人員之待遇，及水陸二路沿途之安全等，均應注意及之，俾不妨碍整個計劃之實施。</p>
<p>三，勵行各地農工生產：各地居民回鄉後如無正當職業，以資解决其生活，則不僅有背當局實行疏散之至意，抑且易於助長不良份子之再起，而釀成整個地方上之不安。良民不得安居樂業後，仍欲遷滬居住，日久滬上房屋必重行發生供不應求之規象。故實行疏散後，從事勵行各地農工生產，亦與解决居住問題有密切不可分之關係。所謂勵行各地農工生產，即一則應盡量舉辦各地農業與工業　款，滅低放款利息，二則應派農工技術人員赴各地協助並督促人民從事生產事業，三則應獎勵各地生產事業之發展；四則應切實保障農民與勞工生活；五則應限制土地私有者之特殊權利；六則應合理分　各項生產必需物品與消費者。當局如能斟酌實際狀况，予以逐一切實推行，則各地生產發達，地方安謐，平民生活得以安定，斯則重心所在之居住問題亦驟然解决矣。</p>
<p>四，切實推行配給制度：當局推行配給制度，原期杜絕奸商之囤積居奇，壟斷物價，以資安定民生。然觀乎目前，奸商囤積之風雖　稍　，而物價之黑市依然暢行，是由於常局之未能切實推行是項制度耳。際此物價步高之秋，一般出租人即當藉口增加房租，而承租人以不能負擔為理由拒絕出租人之請求，於是雙方互不諒解，對簿公庭，則房屋租賃之糾紛，仍將層出不窮也。故各地生產發達，生活必需品之供給無盧置乏後，尙須切實推行配給制度，方可使今後之居住問題得以解决。欲切實推行是項制度，一則應按各戶人口盡行增加配給之數量，使黑市於無形中完全消失；二則應參酌目前生活狀况嚴定各項必需品之價格，如商店有不遵命令或未得許可而私擅高價者，應即予以停業與沒收貨物之處分；三則應提高執行配給人員之待遇，如有營私舞弊情事，經審查屬實後，應即撤職嚴辦。</p>
<p>五，嚴禁切不常娛樂：當局雖一再申令禁止烟賭，而各地仍不乏公然設立之烟館與賭塲。按烟賭不僅易使人民墮落，增加社會上之不良份子，有礙整個之治安，抑且直接影響於居住問題者亦至深且鉅，蓋經營烟賭之人於租賃房屋時，莫不願出鉅額之頂費·挖費·及租金，出租人為欲滿足慾望，極願與之發生租賃關係，而平民急需房屋供居住之用者，反而向隅，是烟賭之不予澈底禁止，亦為發生居住問題之重大原因。故欲望今後房屋租賃之改善，當局應下决心嚴禁烟暗，一則凡對於巳設立之烟館·賭塲，應即勒令停止營業；如發見無論何人正在籌設者，應立予嚴懲不貸；二則應施行澈底有效辦法，盡行曉諭人民戒絕烟睹，此外如舞塲·戲院等遊藝塲所，其為害雖不若烟賭之深，然設立過甚亦與目前之居住問題不無密切之關係，為增加房屋之數量計，當局應盡行勸諭經營上述各項遊藝所之主人於可能範圍內改為出租之房屋，且對於遵行者，應予以特別之獎勵與保障；嗣後如遇有申請開設者，應絕對不予准許。</p>
<p>改進今後房屋租賃之澈底辦法，已如上述，是否可行，尙祈社會宏　予以不吝指正是幸。</p>
<h3 id="c61">再度疏散上海人口 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 王希堯</p>
<p>十二月二十二日的報上，載着一段中央社東京電訊：「日政府為澈底强化國內體制，疏散都市人口起見，於二十一日定例閣議時，决定疏散都市人口實施要綱，……我雖米到過日本，不知道日本今日的情况究竟如何，不過從許多報吿日本現狀的文字看來，即使以日本最繁榮的大都會東京為例，其人口密度恐怕還不及今日的上海。東京人口並不極度擁擠，而日本政府已有疏散人口的計劃，那末我國政府當局，對於上海人口問題，可以不予以考慮嗎？</p>
<p>都市人口過分擁擠、無論在平時，在戰時，都不是好的現象。日本政府這種措施，是具有先見之明的。都市人口的過多，是有着非常嚴重的後果。</p>
<p>今日上海的人口，已經是超過飽和點，表而上似乎沒有大的害處，但孕藏着的危機却日深，將」旦如山洪爆發而不可收拾。這並非過甚其辭，試把這種危機分析如下：</p>
<p>都市危機分析</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭勃發後，上海因各種物資存儲量究竟還多，所以不覺得物資缺乏的恐慌，可是經二年多的大量消耗，存底日薄，至今日，各項物資漸感竭乏。本來在戰爭期中，大量物資需用於軍事方面，但人民亦須有最低限度的用量，可是今日當局所配給我們的米，　，糧，油等物，那一樣眞眞够用，數量旣少，而配給日期又遙遠，眞的完全靠這些，早就不得活命了，市民仍須添購黑市補充。黑市來源不外兩端：囤戶出籠，走私。一且囤戶出籠乾凈，走私澈底禁絕，人民恃何而生？出籠終有完盡一天，而觀乎當局對於物資統制的日益嚴密，走私亦終將消減，屆時勢必要求增多配給量，可是事實上能够眞眞配到够用的數量絕對不可能。這也不太多。當局已經化九牛二虎之力，把相當巨大數額的物資運滬分配，可是因人口實在太多，所以每人只能得到一些些。戰爭延將來上海有兩種現象可能發生：一是各樣物資存底告竭；一是當局運滬物資數抗減少。種種嚴重後果，隨即發生。</p>
<p>返觀各地和平區內，物資雖亦缺少，可是比上海總盟裕些，因內地十九為農業產區，而且人少，消費量小。可是當局為什麼不能把內地剩餘的物資全部運滬呢？因物資散於各地城鎭鄕縣，收集不易一，而目運輸亦相當困難。</p>
<p>物資旣然匱乏，各種生產事業不能獲得大量原料，各項工業不能維持正常生產量。最近又因煤斤恐慌及電力限制，各大小工廠，勢必再度減工。這結果，一方面，使市面商品供應量減少，促使物價上漲；另一方面，因每種工商業縮小規模，社會上又增加了一批失業的人士。</p>
<p>上海本來是個人浮於事的地方，這種情形，至今尤烈。社會上失業者日增，生存競爭日趨尖銳，治安就發生了動搖。</p>
<p>街頭米販絡繹不絕，各路舟車單帮販客日益猖獗，都足以滋長黑市之風，這影響治安還小。一旦到了販貨之道已窮的時候斃，兇悍的就淪為為盜匪，所謂「餓死不如犯法」。</p>
<p>應謀適當對策</p>
<p>要解除上面各項危機，應謀以下的對策：　　今日上海的工商業，是相當的繁榮，返觀和平區內，却貧乏得可以，許多種類的隊業都集中在上海。我們不但要求疏散上海人口，並且希望工商業不僅在上海呈畸形的局部的發展，整個和平區內須全面發展。政府應當積極展開復興內地工商業的各項措置，且應當帮助人民把一部分工商業搬至內地去經營。我們期待着：在內地荒蕪的土地上，重建起雄偉的廠房。商業本來是跟着工業而走的，因工業的推進，內地商業當然也能逐漸繁榮起來。工商業發達之後，需要很多人材，人民自然會從生存競爭劇烈的上海移到內地各方去。</p>
<p>各地應普設學校，學校的數目須增加，質量亦須提高。內地本來是求空氣新鮮，有益靑年人的身心，戰前本來有不少上海靑年跑到各地求學。內地學校的質量旣能增高，莘莘學子們自然樂於跟隨父母返鄉求學。此外，我們還要求敎育當局，命令遷滬的各校一律搬回原地復校，這樣不但可以減少上海人口，且在滬各校，校舍狹窄，環境不良，遷回內地上課，可增進敎學效率，對於國家亦極有裨益。</p>
<p>內地各種建設事業，亦應積極推進。疏通河道，不但利於交通，而且解决民衆的用水問題。戰前原來有自來水設備的城市，當局亦應設法恢復，並使供應情形良好。至於電力廠亦應加以整頓，如事實上不克供給日電，至少限度則晚上電量須充足，而且保持經常供應，不使中斷。其他如道路的修理，電話的裝置，衛生事業的提倡，公共舟車的通輰等等，都是應該脚踏實地去做的。總之，使各地的生活條件良好，人民自然樂於回到家鄉去。</p>
<p>和平區內治安，亟應力謀强化，不良份子果須剷除，即竊小亦應不使存在。軍警職權務須分明，紀律務須嚴格。要使內地治安良好，首須强化保甲組織。內地保甲制度都不及上海好，戶口的不準確，保甲長的不負責任，組織的散漫，處處必須改良。自憼　値　制度亦須採用。復應訓練壯丁，使人民實際負起維持鄉土安寗的重任。</p>
<p>改良車站秧序，更應加緊進行，盼望華中鐵道公司當局下决心，澈底改良進出車站，購票，以及檢查行李的辦法。</p>
<p>上海人口擁　之危機，市民不回鄕因素及其對對於此種問題之注視以及熱心人士進一步的探討。</p>

<h3 id="e2">New Year's Greetings <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>— General Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Forces in China, Shiroku Hata</p>
<p>On the China front, under the magnificent imperial grace during this third New Year of the Greater East Asia War, the great task of revitalizing Asia is progressing steadily, overcoming all difficulties. The imperial grace is spreading across the continent, and the dawn of a new era is truly worthy of celebration.</p>
<p>However, this year's war situation will increasingly enter a genuine stage. The decisive battles determining the rise and fall of the Empire will be carried out successively on land, sea, and air. Therefore, the mission of the Expeditionary Forces will become even more important. Here, I hope that all officers and soldiers will renew their spirits, unite like iron and stone, strive to expand our war capabilities and strengthen our war preparations, unite from top to bottom, and resolutely advance with vigor and determination, in order to destroy the Chongqing government's will to resist and defeat the Anglo-American forces. At this time, the relationship between China and Japan will become even closer in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. The momentum of cooperation and mutual support is truly gratifying. In the future, we will remove the deep-rooted obstacles that lie ahead and spare no effort in working together. The officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Forces must remember this glory and mission, and in the face of the great decisive battle, they must devote themselves to their duties with utmost sincerity, so as to live up to the trust of His Majesty, repay the meritorious achievements of the brave soldiers, and live up to the trust of the 100 million people in the home islands. In this New Year of unprecedented emergency, I briefly express my thoughts as a dedication.</p>

<p>Nanjing, December 31st, Central News Agency: With the winter vacation approaching, schools are preparing for semester exams. A large number of students in various schools are unable to continue their studies in the next semester due to family financial constraints. For the sake of cultivating talents for the nation, this phenomenon urgently needs to be remedied. The China Youth Semimonthly Magazine, in view of this, is organizing grants for impoverished students in addition to appealing to all sectors of society for relief, in order to provide relief. Yesterday, our magazine reporter visited the United Society and interviewed Mr. Xu Xiqing, the president of the magazine, to inquire about the situation of this event. According to Mr. Xu, this magazine is a publication for young people across the country to research and communicate ideas. Since its publication, it has been cherished by young people across the country, and its circulation has increased sharply. This magazine will continue to uphold its founding principle of serving young people and continue to work hard. The China Youth Model Corps is organizing a leadership scholarship, and this magazine is also organizing a scholarship for impoverished students. The two have slightly different natures. The Model Corps is organizing awards for outstanding young people, while this magazine is organizing scholarships focusing on relieving impoverished students. The scholarship is national in nature, and responsible institutions will select candidates separately. The scholarship organized by this magazine is limited by funding, and the current event will temporarily focus on the capital. Those who meet the qualifications are eligible to register for the exam.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Soviet Forces Exert Heavy Pressure on the Vitebsk Front; German Forces in the Central Sector Strategically Retreat <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: Fierce battles broke out in the Korosten-Berdichev-Belaya Tserkov area on the 29th. The Soviet forces launched a large-scale offensive with overwhelming strength and gradually expanded their offensive front, forcing the German command to order a withdrawal from Korosten in accordance with the flexible defense strategy. The German forces are still offering strong resistance east of Zhitomir and east of Berdichev, but the battle to prevent the enemy from advancing between Berdichev and Belaya Tserkov has not yet been decided. The enemy continued to launch fierce attacks in the Vitebsk area, focusing especially on the railway line leading to Polotsk. Thanks to the strong resistance of the German forces, the situation did not change yesterday. The southern route of the Eastern Front now seems to be the main location of the Soviet winter operations. The enemy seems to have amassed a large number of troops and munitions in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River and the Vitebsk-Nevel area. Their pressure on Vitebsk is extremely high. If the Soviet forces were to break through on a large scale there, it would endanger the Baltic States. The Soviet forces have been working on operations on the southern route during the summer and autumn of this year, attempting to defeat the German southern front and threaten the Baltic region. Judging from their recent actions, the Soviet forces will likely continue this strategy during the winter.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports: Soviet forces launched a large-scale attack with tanks and infantry east and northwest of Vitebsk, hoping to break through the main German defense line and encircle the German positions to achieve a large-scale victory. In the fierce back-and-forth battle, Soviet forces penetrated the German positions southeast of Vitebsk. As their formation was preparing to expand this initial victory, the German forces immediately launched a counterattack and destroyed the enemy's tank wedges, causing the Soviet forces to suffer a serious defeat. At the same time, the Soviet forces are reinforcing the Vitebsk area, and are expected to continue their attempts to break through.</p>

<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports: Although the fighting on the southern Italian front on Wednesday was of a local nature, its activity became more active. Along the Tyrrhenian coast, the enemy attempted to advance towards Ventotene, but suffered heavy losses at the hands of the German frontline guards, forcing them to halt their advance. At the same time, the enemy's landing operations in the nearby area did not help General Clark's troops. The landing troops were intercepted and surrounded before they reached Viá Appia near the coast. After a long artillery preparation, the American forces launched a fierce attack in the western Apennine Mountains near the entrance to the highway from Mignano to Cassino, but were repulsed before reaching the German minefields. North of Venafro, the enemy attacked the German defense line on the spurs of Mount Mainarde three times, all without success. At the same time, in the eastern sector, a company of Canadian troops attempted a fierce attack north of Ortona, but collapsed under German defensive fire. Reports indicate that the Imperial troops have built temporary field fortifications in the area to withstand the superior German artillery. Two companies of Canadian troops launched a strategic offensive along the coast, but were stopped by German vanguards.</p>

<h3 id="e16">New Year's Expectations: This Year is a "Year of Renovation" <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China. As this year begins, we should offer some expectations for everything in the coming year, as usual. However, today we do not want to be overly ambitious. We only want to say a few honest words and offer them to the authorities, while also expecting the general public. Because, looking at the internal and external situations, we must strive for self-improvement in order to seek renovation. We expect the government to lead the people in realizing three points of renovation within this year.</p>
<p>First, we hope for "political integrity." We, the common people, only hope for a good government with clean politics. Only when there are good people in the government can politics be clean, and only then can we reach the realm of "political integrity." There have been too many grand and sensational propositions, theories, and slogans in the past ten years. But the actual political achievements have been less than one in ten, so the common people have long been tired of hearing them. This year, we only need a simple good government and truly clean politics.</p>
<p>Second, we hope to "alleviate the people's suffering." The government should start anew with the people, taking the alleviation of the people's hardships as the decisive target for its policies. Then the people will sincerely submit to the government, unite as one, and generate strength.</p>
<p>Third, we hope to "put participation in the war into practice." Although we have been participating in the war for nearly a year, we have not only had no direct contribution to the war, but have also suffered many difficulties and obstacles. In the past, we only talked about participation in the war, and this year we must put the task of participation in the war into practice, and then jointly build the new order of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>The first two of the three points mentioned above are entirely the responsibility of the government, while the latter is led by the government and jointly assisted by the people. So, how can we achieve these hopes? We offer the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, hoping for a good government, the most important thing is, of course, personnel matters. The first step is to adjust personnel, so that the right person is in the right position. The second step is to adjust compensation, so that officials are incorruptible. The recent appointment of Mr. Zhang Yipeng by the government is a commendable and wise measure. It not only selects people based on their abilities, but also gives the people a new impression. Currently, there are many talented and capable people in the peace zone. If the government can sincerely recruit them, appointing those who are interested in politics to political work, and urging those who are not interested in politics to take on social work, so that no talent is left unused, and officials all have their strengths, it will not be difficult to become a "good government." If the government adopts a closed-door policy and does not seek talent, it is a mistake of the government. If the government can break down party prejudices and recruit talent widely, but the people are self-righteous and refuse to cooperate, it is inappropriate for the people. We hope that starting with the appointment of Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the government will widely recruit talent, and the people will be happy to participate in government and social work. Second, reduce redundant institutions to simplify administration and focus on efficiency.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, alleviating the people's suffering, the most urgent issue at present is the price problem. Because prices are rising without end, threatening every person seriously. Second, cultivate the people's strength, because sufficient people's strength can be the government's backing. According to the current situation, Kuomintang members account for a very small number of the total population and cannot solely bear the heavy responsibility of the whole country. We must cultivate the strength of the whole people, develop it evenly, in order to jointly bear the heavy responsibility. Moreover, the Communist Party is best at taking advantage of opportunities during wartime to expand its influence and harm the country and the nation. Therefore, the Kuomintang must cultivate the strength of the whole people on the one hand, and become one with the whole people on the other, in order to prevent the spread of the Communist Party. The most important work in cultivating the strength of the people is to give the people the opportunity to participate in politics and the right to demand the improvement of their own lives. On the part of the people, they must cultivate their own strength on the one hand, and support the policies of the ruling party on the other, in order to jointly save the current and future crises. If the government leaves the people, fears the people's strength, and insists on dictatorship, it is taking the path to self-destruction of the Russian Empire. And if the people do not urge the government on the one hand, and support the government on the other, they are also taking the path to self-destruction. The fact that the government and the people survive together if they unite, and perish together if they do not, is a very clear principle.</p>
<p>Regarding the third point, we can only talk about "putting participation in the war into practice" after we have fully achieved the above two points. Otherwise, empty talk about participation in the war will be just as empty as in the past, and there will be no practical contribution. Only by putting the task of participation in the war into practice can we talk about working with the Allies to strive for victory, and only then can we talk about jointly building the new order of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Here, we must offer a word to the Allies: We hope that the Japanese government and people must value the strength of the Chinese people, recognize the demands of the Chinese people, and help the Chinese people cultivate their own strength, so that the Chinese people can hold their heads high. Only then can the Chinese problem be optimistic, and only then can Sino-Japanese relations be optimistic.</p>
<p>This year is a "Year of Renovation." We hope that the government will renovate itself! The people will renovate themselves, and at the same time urge the government to renovate! The Allies will assist us in renovating!</p>

<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: The German Supreme Headquarters announced that the German Navy engaged the British fleet in the Bay of Biscay, heavily damaging the British cruisers HMS Glasgow (9,100 tons) and HMS Enterprise (7,580 tons), with one of them catching fire.</p>
<p>Berlin, December 31st, Central News Agency: The German News Agency reports, military intelligence: The victory of the German submarines in the Bay of Biscay engagement with the British fleet was reported yesterday. It is now reported that the German submarines have sunk two more enemy destroyers and four freighters loaded with troops and war materiel, totaling 30,000 tons. The destroyers were sunk off the North American coast and in the Mediterranean, while the freighters were destroyed in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Since the 22nd of this month, the British destroyer fleet has lost sixteen ships, which is almost equivalent to the British losing two destroyers every day during the past election day.</p>

<p>Lisbon, December 31st, Central News Agency: Havas reports: With the arrival of the New Year, every Portuguese must ask themselves whether Portugal can avoid the arrival of war in 1944. Because the war is now closer to Portugal's borders than in 1939, the intensified military buildup of the Portuguese army over the past year allows every Portuguese to know that their government is prepared to deal with the unexpected. What the people wish for, in addition to maintaining peace, is the hope that the coming year will be a year of good harvests, so that Portugal's foreign policy will not be economically dependent on others. In 1943, Portugal suffered an unprecedented harvest failure, so that all imports were controlled by British naval licenses. As a result, the Azores borrowing agreement was established, allowing Portugal's food borrowing to be uninterrupted. Due to the lack of various necessities, the Portuguese people eagerly hope that the rationing system can be implemented as soon as possible, so that food can be shared more evenly. The authorities have now increased workers' wages by 20 percent, and merchants who have made wartime profits are subject to heavy taxes. Other measures include suppressing labor unrest, prohibiting speculation and hoarding, and vigorously addressing security and bread issues for the coming year. If Prime Minister Salazar can meet the needs of the people, his prestige will be maintained.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Civil Defense Headquarters Held Reception for Reporters Yesterday, Hoping to Expand Publicity on the Meaning of Civil Defense <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters, having been established and begun operations, held a reception for journalists yesterday (the 31st) at 4:30 PM at the First Police Precinct's Policemen's Club. Commissioner Chen Gongbo was unable to attend due to official duties and was represented by Chief of General Affairs Sun Lifu. Also in attendance were Director of Municipal Propaganda Liang Xiuyu, Director of Education Lin An, Deputy Director of Education Tan Tiankai, Director of Economic Affairs Feng You, Deputy Director of the First Precinct Watanabe Tadashi, First District Secretary Takase Den, Deputy Chief of General Affairs Noguchi Kinjiro, Deputy Chief of Finance Kamishiro, Fire Chief Iwai Kiyomi, Chief of Intelligence Ike Yu, and over sixty Chinese and Japanese reporters.</p>
<p>Chief Sun's Speech</p>
<p>Chief Sun delivered a speech on behalf of Commissioner Chen, stating that the Headquarters hoped for citizen cooperation to achieve the goals of passive civil defense. He also hoped for the assistance of the press to expand publicity efforts, so that the public thoroughly understands the meaning of civil defense. From January 9th, the anniversary of the start of the war would be designated as Civil Defense Day, with lectures, exhibitions, and training held to complete citizen civil defense. Deputy Chief of General Affairs Noguchi Kinjiro then described the civil defense plan in great detail.</p>
<p>Director Liang's Speech</p>
<p>Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Department then spoke, saying that with the establishment of the Civil Defense Headquarters, considerable preparations had been made for civil defense, and the lives and property of our five million citizens could be protected. We express our admiration and gratitude. Therefore, those present must expand publicity to make all residents of the city understand the meaning of civil defense and cooperate closely.</p>
<p>Mr. Watanabe's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Watanabe Tadashi spoke, stating that during his recent return to Japan, he had seen air raid shelters everywhere. In this city, the Public Works Bureau would begin excavating shelters in various parks on the first Civil Defense Day, and citizens must cooperate. Although there was some reason for the rumor that digging deep would cause water to seep into the shelters, the eighth district could be excavated. As for food and clothing, the authorities were prepared. Germany had ordered all people to store a year's worth of clothing in a safe place for future use, which this city could also adopt. Regarding publicity, please do your best to help the public understand the significance of civil defense. The reception ended at approximately 6:00 PM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Flour and Bran Distribution Office, in order to meet the needs of the population and prevent abuses, has reached an agreement with relevant authorities to improve the flour distribution system for household rations and special allocations. A detailed survey of household registration books for flour rations and special allocations, as well as the flour needs of the food industry associations, has been completed. It is reported that the 23rd and 24th rounds of household flour for Nanshi, Huxi, Huben, and Pudong South Districts have been paid for and collected by the district public rice distribution offices from the distribution office on December 28th, and warehouse receipts have been obtained to withdraw goods from the flour mills. It has been decided that the simultaneous distribution will take place from the 5th to the 10th of this month (January), with each person purchasing two "shi jin" (市斤) (one "shi jin" equals approximately 500 grams) of flour (one "shi jin" per round) upon presentation of the 23rd and 24th round flour purchase certificates issued by the Municipal Grain Bureau.</p>
<p>Eighty-Two Tea and Snack Shops to Receive Flour Allocation</p>

The association has already obtained the flour from the distribution office and is authorized to distribute it to the approved members, who can collect their flour from the designated district distribution points from January 5th to 10th upon payment. The association has submitted a request for a review to the distribution office for members who have not been approved. The flour allocation for members in the First and Eighth Districts is currently being closely reviewed by the distribution office and should be approved soon.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e29">Reading the Mayor's Letter to the Citizens <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>After reading Mayor Chen's letter to the citizens (see the first page of the New Year's special edition), we believe that every citizen has the same feeling: "Truth" and "Sincerity."</p>
<p>From the citizens' point of view, the most ideal mayor must have two characteristics: First, a thorough understanding of local conditions and the needs of the citizens. Second, assisting citizens in relieving various kinds of suffering. Now Mayor Chen has already achieved the first point and has also sincerely expressed the solution to various problems, which is such a blessing for the citizens of Shanghai.</p>
<p>We have said before that Shanghai occupies a very important position in the peace zone. At the same time, it is also the place where Sino-Japanese cooperation is the closest. In the past, we often blamed the evils of Britain and the United States. However, now it is our own management, and we have the cooperation of allies, and the best talents of both China and Japan are gathered here. Therefore, objectively speaking, if Shanghai is not well managed, there is no need to talk about the distant and the great, and we are not worthy of blaming the past.</p>
<p>The Shanghai we envision as a political model zone in the peace zone must first start with establishing a good-person government and a clean government. Furthermore, it will become a model zone for Sino-Japanese cooperation. The Chinese side hires Japanese experts to assist in governance, and the Japanese side must do its best to assist in reforming everything.</p>
<p>The most important sentence is that if Shanghai wants to become a political model zone and a Sino-Japanese cooperation model zone, it must quickly establish a representative body. This is what we proposed at the time of the takeover of the concessions, and Mayor Chen once said that it could be established soon. We believe that only by quickly establishing a representative body can there be a leading backbone in society, which is what the mayor is fervently hoping for today.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Liu Jie's Mother's Will Donates Funds for Education; Donates 2,000 Yuan to This Newspaper's Education Fund <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Liu Jie's mother, Zhang Yiren (the late mother of Liu Lisheng), supported her orphaned son's education from an early age, enduring hardship and winning praise from her fellow villagers. Throughout her life, she was considerate of her neighbors and family and was especially generous. The poet Li Bake presented her with a poem on her sixtieth birthday, which included the lines: "A virtuous woman fulfills the role of a loving mother, her example inspires the weak to stand tall. Caring for family is a lifelong task, and her virtue shines brightly." This captures the essence of her life. She passed away from a cerebral hemorrhage on November 10th of last year, at the age of sixty-two. Her will stipulated that 2,000 yuan in national currency be donated to support scholarships for impoverished students in Southeast China. In her early years, Liu Jie's mother lived abroad in the East and often scrimped and saved to provide relief and assistance to the poor. Her tireless dedication to good deeds is truly inspiring and worthy of emulation. We also thank Zhu Xiaofang for donating 1,000 yuan saved from his mother's centennial memorial and Qu Shouyutang and his wife for donating 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: Liu Yunfang (donated in accordance with Liu Jie's mother's will) 2,000 yuan, Ge Honggao 2,000 yuan, Li Caiji 2,000 yuan, Zhu Xiaofang (savings from his late mother's centennial memorial) 1,000 yuan, Qu Shouyutang and his wife (double birthday celebration) 1,000 yuan, Mr. Chen 1,000 yuan, Pure People 835 yuan, Shen Yilang 500 yuan, Anonymous 500 yuan, Mr. Ding 350 yuan, Jiang Lean 300 yuan, Shen Zhidetang 200 yuan, Chen Xinkang 50 yuan, Ying Yongyu and Ying Taishu and sons Chun Gao and Chun Tong (congratulations to relatives and friends on the New Year) 40 yuan, Su Minsheng and Mr. Yao 20 yuan each, Patient and Brightness (delivered by Mr. Pu Qiting) 10 yuan each.

<p>At this auspicious time of the New Year of the 2,604th year of the Imperial Era, during the Holy War, I extend my heartfelt wishes for the Emperor's longevity and the prosperity of our sacred nation. At the same time, my belief in our inevitable victory grows ever stronger, which brings me great joy. The Greater East Asia War is gradually entering its decisive phase. The enemy's counterattacks are extremely fierce. The sacrifices of the Yamazaki and Shibasaki units have inspired the national spirit even further. Looking at the overall war situation, it is becoming increasingly clear that final victory will belong to us. Regarding the operations in the Pacific, although the enemy has gained a forward base with a huge force, the sacrifices they have suffered are extremely significant. Even the enemy, which boasts vast resources, will find it difficult to endure, especially the losses in manpower. Therefore, they are still hesitant to reveal the truth to their people. In the Indian Ocean, the enemy's so-called operation to recover Burma cannot be launched under the surveillance of our naval and land forces. This war is against the United States, filled with ambition, and Britain, old and cunning. They are repeatedly launching counterattacks at great cost and sacrifice, attempting to attack us with Anglo-Saxon propaganda tactics. We can only maintain an absolutely undefeated stance, regarding our own lives as light as a feather, to respond to the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines. The people in the rear must unite and work hard to expand production and concentrate all their efforts to achieve the goals of the war. Then, there is no doubt that final victory will be ours.</p>
<p>I am delighted that the allied nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are unanimously cooperating to complete the Holy War. The great task of Greater East Asia construction is progressing daily. This war is a long war, and there may be many detours and twists and turns in its future. We should not be happy or sad about a local victory or defeat. We must focus all our energy on our position, firmly believing that final victory will belong to us.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Expectations for the Economic Sector This Year <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The year is renewed, and the 33rd year of the Republic has begun. Speaking of the economy in the economic sector, I only feel that in the past year, the economic sector has seen many earth-shattering creations, either related to adjusting the currency system, or related to increasing production, or related to cracking down on hoarding, or related to implementing rationing, or related to preventing speculation, or related to saving consumption. On the surface, it is enough to become a spectacle of wartime controlled economy in the past year. However, the entire national economy is so unsatisfactory in substance. Speaking of production, it is exactly as our editorial said yesterday: the government politically advocates increasing production during wartime, but what is reflected in the national economy in substance is a decrease in production. Speaking of frugality, in addition to saving sunlight as the most effective, some people spend thousands of yuan for a meal, or tens of thousands to millions of yuan at a time, and whether banning smoking, gambling, and dancing can become a reality is still a question. In addition, hoarders hoard, speculators speculate, and the psychology of depreciating currency and raising prices is getting worse and worse, and there is a tendency to intensify. At the same time, in terms of rationing, there is either no rice or no coal, which only makes the vast majority of people feel uneasy all day long.</p>
<p>What we expect this year is a substantial improvement in the entire national economy and strive to establish the economy of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What is the economy of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? It is based on the manpower and material resources within the circle, and implements a thorough controlled economy to substantially enrich military preparations, stabilize people's livelihoods, and seek the lasting and universal prosperity of the national economy. In particular, standing under the banner of wartime controlled economy, we must redouble our efforts to thoroughly implement the new economic system this year, and never allow the various malpractices of low productivity, non-smooth rationing, and unstable people's livelihood to continue to exist in the economic sector this year.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Year-End Summary: Banks and Money Exchanges Peaceful; Four-Day Holiday Starting Today; Business as Usual on the 5th <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the total closing day for the 32nd year [1943]. Banks and money exchanges conducted their final accounting. As customary, all banks and pawnshops suspended all lending activities, and all transactions were limited to cash only. All outstanding loans were required to be repaid, in accordance with established commercial ethics. Yesterday, as it was the total closing day, all banks and pawnshops extended their office hours internally to expedite settlement. The Clearing House, to facilitate collection and delivery, stipulated that clearing would be conducted at 3:00 PM. The deposit time for clearing documents entrusted to agents was before 2:15 PM, and for transactions between fellow businesses, it was before 2:00 PM. As for the deposit time for various collection documents, it remained the same. The deadline for customers to replenish funds and for the Clearing House to transfer payments was 6:30 PM. Returned checks had to be returned in full on the same day. The entire financial situation, after the Central Reserve Bank and the Silver Union Money Exchange exerted their best efforts to regulate, was manageable, and all sectors safely navigated the total closing period. All banks, pawnshops, and stock markets will be closed for four days starting today and will reopen for business on the 5th.</p>
<p>Regulating Interbank Lending</p>
<p>After the Bank Joint Reserve Committee regulated interbank lending, banks and pawnshops that have a legitimate need for funds in their business can apply to the committee for lending by providing collateral in accordance with the law. The committee has also set the lending limit for each bank and pawnshop. It is reported that the committee has issued a notice to its member banks and pawnshops, stating: "In accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 and Article 5 of the committee's interbank lending regulations, in January, April, July, and October of each year, the committee should calculate based on the end of the previous three months, the total amount of current deposits on which each bank should pay current deposit reserves, and re-determine the lending limit for each bank in the committee. Now that the time for re-determining the lending limit has arrived, the lending limit of your bank is determined in accordance with the aforementioned regulations, and it is hoped that you will send a representative to the committee to renew the agreement.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Exchanges All Obtain Substantial Profits</p>
<p>According to reporters' inquiries with banks and money exchanges, after the year-end summary of all banks, money exchanges, and companies and factories, it is reported that they have all been able to obtain considerable profits, especially in the first half of the year before the purchase of cotton cloth. Some of the past bad debts of some banks and pawnshops have gradually recovered both principal and interest, and all new loans can be repaid on time. The credit of each industry is very good, and there has never been a case of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>— Huang Wan</p>
<p>Propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame are the principles of conduct; Filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and trustworthiness are the foundation of being a person.</p>
<p>Have a bright attitude, a pure purpose, and align your words with your actions; Be universally loving and utterly sincere.</p>
<p>If you are upright in your heart, everything will succeed; Do not be greedy for fame and fortune, and守本分 keep to your duty.</p>
<p>Establishing a foundation and building a career depend entirely on perseverance; When socializing and interacting, be humble and cautious.</p>
<p>Treat neighbors, friends, relatives, and clansmen with familiarity, even if they are distant; Choose what is good and follow it, and there will be benefit without harm.</p>
<p>Rescue those in need and support those in danger, as it is your bounden duty; Treat the rich, the noble, the poor, and the lowly equally.</p>
<p>If others deceive you, influence them with sincerity; I would rather be wronged by others than wrong others.</p>
<p>Time is precious, research and study knowledge; Specialize in one skill, and you will not worry about hunger.</p>
<p>If you do not engage in proper work, you will be looked down upon; Seeking help from others is not as good as striving on your own.</p>
<p>Be detached and clear in your aspirations, and live as you are; Rather than being rich in corruption, it is better to be poor in purity.</p>
<p>Even though ancestors are distant,祭祀祭必誠 offer sacrifices with utmost sincerity; A harmonious family brings joy to familial relationships.</p>
<p>Extravagance and indulgence lead to dissipation and ruin; Prostitution, gambling, opium, and alcohol destroy families and lives.</p>
<p>When choosing a wife or son-in-law, seek only virtue and ability; Marriages and funerals should be conducted according to one's means.</p>
<p>Do not dislike humble dwellings, but choose your neighbors carefully; Wear simple clothes, eat plain food, and live a life of work and study.</p>
<p>Save on clothing and food, and turn mud into gold; Use extravagance to guide towards frugality, and use the law to awaken those who are lost.</p>
<p>Wealth can relieve the poor, and the law can cure the foolish; By giving both wealth and law, you can help others achieve success.</p>
<p>Wake up early and go to bed early, cherish your essence and nourish your spirit; Exercise your body and protect your physical and mental health.</p>
<p>Speak less idle talk and do more proper things; Conceal evil and praise good, and your merits will be immense.</p>
<p>Being harsh to others will bring disaster upon you; Cherish resources and do not kill living beings lightly.</p>
<p>Ancestral fortunes should not be exhausted; Plant blessings and accumulate virtue to benefit future generations.</p>
<p>A kind and benevolent heart will bring prosperity to the family; If you behave in this way, you will enjoy happiness, longevity, and health.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwataya Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Youth (8)</p>
<p>Although it is said to be the spring semester, by the time the banana flowers are in full bloom and the loquats are ripe, it is completely like summer.</p>
<p>"I have already been swimming with Jiro at the beach!"</p>
<p>Hearing such words from friends, Masato could not help but want to go swimming too. However, he had suffered from otitis media due to swimming during elementary school, and his mother would not allow it no matter what after she found out.</p>
<p>Having no other way, Masato specialized in studying Judo. Judo suited his nature, and he progressed quickly. In addition, he also dabbled in sports like baseball and tennis, but he only excelled in Judo.</p>
<p>The Judo uniform felt like a bath mat and was often soaked with sweat. He would wipe his body with cold water, and he would never forget the feeling as he left the martial arts hall. The shadow of the camphor tree was also being blown by the cool breeze from the sea for a long time. There were no figures in the sports field, and only the school building stood there quietly.</p>
<p>His good friend Takao was in the Kendo club, so they were not together because their study times differed. Masato draped his Judo uniform over himself and strolled along a corner of the sports field.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in a corner shaded by the sun, he saw something like a stone monument standing there.</p>
<p>(I still don't know about this thing…)</p>
<p>Although it was not an old stone monument, it was majestic, with a stone base below. On the surface of the natural stone tablet, the words "Site of the Residence of Elder Nakahara Yuukai" were engraved.</p>
<p>(Who is Nakahara Yuukai…)</p>
<p>Masato raised his head.</p>
<p>Kagoshima is a place with many monuments. If you go to Kajiyacho, there are monuments erected to the birthplaces of Saigo Nanshu, Okubo Toshimichi, and Admiral Togo. In addition, there are monuments to Lady Nogi Shizuko, Duke Oyama, etc., erected in various places. Moreover, even if the owners of these monuments are not from Kagoshima, as long as they are Japanese, everyone knows their names. After all, they are great people, so monuments are built to commemorate them.</p>
<p>But he had never heard of the name Nakahara Yuukai. Perhaps he was a subordinate of Lord Saigo who died in the Battle of Shiroyama! However, counting the names of Kirino, Murata, Beppu, and other people, there was no such person among them. What kind of person was he, and what kind of things did he do? It would be too unlike him not to know the owner of a monument erected on the school grounds of his alma mater—</p>
<p>Masato squinted one eye and read the small words carved on the brick surface:</p>
<p>"The elder's given name was Hisao, commonly known as Yuukai, and his pseudonym was Tesshinsai. He was the second son of Nakahara Hisamichi, a retainer of the Kagoshima domain. He was intelligent and ambitious, with a strong interest in both literary and military arts. He was proficient in artillery. He was promoted to serve Lord Shokoku, prepared御藥方 (medicine prescriptions), and specialized in studying 'Schemel'". The inscription had many more words below, but Masato stopped reading at the word "Schemel".</p>
<p>(What does he do? Is he a doctor)?</p>

<p>Special Issue for the New Year of the 33rd Year of the Republic of China</p>
<h3 id="e42">Chairman Wang's New Year's Address <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wang underwent surgery at the Allied Army Hospital on December 19th of last year to remove a bullet from his back. The recovery was extremely good. He only rested and recuperated for the entire day, and from the 20th, he summoned the heads of various departments and councils to receive instructions in front of his bed, handling major political, military, and diplomatic affairs. His spirit has been improving day by day, and the wound has completely healed, as predicted by the military doctors. The surgical treatment has been completed as scheduled, but after the surgery, the blood and health still require internal medical adjustments. At the request of fellow cadres, the New Year's ceremony was presided over by President Wen. The Chairman issued this address, encouraging the people of the country. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Today, following the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we welcome the New Year of the 33rd year. The enhancement of Sino-Japanese friendly relations has a more glorious path. The connections between the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia have a clearer and more accurate standard. The victory in the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War has a more certain grasp. China's independence and East Asia's liberation have a more reliable guarantee. Facing this bright future, there is no need to hesitate or look back. There is also no need to be innovative or different regarding future advancement directions and steps. We only have to adhere to our consistent policies and focus on the three major tasks of "purifying thought," "ensuring security," and "increasing production" for further efforts. Put all our energy into "decisive battle first" to achieve the completion of the Greater East Asia War's objectives and the active development of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, thereby fulfilling the heavy mission of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia.</p>
<p>How can we make further efforts?</p>
<p>Launch a New Era of Cultural Movement</p>
<p>First, regarding the purification of thought, clearing away the poisonous ideology of Britain and the United States and destroying feudal remnants are the two major objectives of the current stage of ideological warfare. To achieve these objectives, we must move from slogans and catchphrases to organized, disciplined, and systematic practice. Under this premise, in this year, on the one hand, we should gather all human and material resources in ideological warfare to launch a new era of cultural movement, making cultural organizations more widespread and in-depth, cultural undertakings more sound and upward, public opinion more active and united, and public sentiment more encouraged and solemn. On the other hand, we must especially ensure that all compatriots in the country, from government officials, military personnel, to farmers, workers, and merchants, uniformly implement the practical work of the New Citizen Movement. Everyone should self-discipline and self-examine. The Greater East Asia War is a war of rise and fall for the East Asian nations, and it is also a war of life and death for China. Everything that can hinder the soaring of the will to the decisive battle and the uplifting of the national spirit must be crushed and cleared away one by one. For example, corruption and selling of positions are malignant bacteria that corrode politics; hoarding and speculation are foolish worms that poison the people's livelihood; extortion and blackmail are roots of disaster that disturb society; decadence and debauchery are toxins that weaken the race; and all other dark phenomena arising from this are intolerable in wartime life and unacceptable for national survival. In this year, we must eliminate them without reservation. In this regard, the government should establish a system of severely punishing corruption and rewarding integrity. In this regard, the public should also rise up together and advocate for a style of integrity and simplicity. We must create a new political and social environment with the cooperation of the government and the people. Only in this way can we establish a new life for the nation and the state, and only in this way can we shoulder the responsibility of total war and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Strengthen Military Strength and Strengthen Civil Self-Defense</p>
<p>Regarding ensuring security, ensuring security is the responsibility of the military, and it is also the responsibility of the people. In this year, we should advance the original military plan, strengthen military strength, and further strengthen the people's self-defense strength. There are two points that should be clearly understood in this regard. First, the essence of building an army is to emphasize both quality and quantity, and to advance simultaneously spiritual education and military equipment and military technology. Future army training must pay attention to this. Second, the nation often says: "To combine military force with the people to ensure security," and the most important thing is to protect the people so that they can live in peace and work, especially to protect the productive people so that productive undertakings can develop safely and the productive forces can be cultivated and expanded. When the army can achieve this, the people will feel the close relationship with the army. At the same time, further, so that the people can do this themselves, the army can exert its upward strength and skills to engage in national defense. In short, the people are the foundation of national strength and the source of military force. Without the development of the people, the army cannot be strengthened. Therefore, we must strengthen the people's self-defense strength while strengthening military strength, so that these two forces are tightly combined to become a root and branch for ensuring security and further become a root and branch for national defense.</p>
<p>A Year of Total Mobilization for Increased Production</p>
<p>Regarding increasing production, this year should be a year of total mobilization for the increased production movement. In order to mobilize human and material resources to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, we must increase production. In order to enrich materials, regulate prices, and improve people's livelihoods, we must increase production. We must ensure that existing human and material resources are not just consumed without replenishment, and we must ensure that the results of growth do not fall on the shoulders of a few, but are used appropriately for the masses, the state, and East Asia. We must especially protect productivity, cultivate productivity, and be fortunate for productivity so that it can be used for reproduction and for expanding reproduction. Only in this way can the two words "increased production" have substantial and valuable meaning. Currently, the most urgent needs for national economy and people's livelihood are clothing and food, so the work of increasing production should first start with agriculture and light industry. In agriculture, increasing the production of food and cotton is the top priority. In light industry, improving the flour industry and the textile industry is the top priority. Even if it is within the reach of current capabilities, if we cannot say that we have enough food and clothing, we must combine the full strength of the government and the people to achieve a rational and possible solution to the food and clothing problem. So that the general public, especially the productive people, can endure the inevitable suffering during the war with hardship and endurance, and at least gradually remove those unnecessary and artificial sufferings that are layered upon them. The government should eliminate empty talk, come up with practical plans, and do things calmly. The public should also no longer stand by and shake their heads and sigh, but should work together and do things practically. Excess idle capital should be used for increased production. Unproductive manpower should be used for increased production. Spare time should be used for increased production. Excessive enjoyment and unnecessary consumption should be saved as much as possible and used for increased production. Daily necessities, as well as the surplus waste from agriculture, industry, and commerce, should also be collected and used for increased production. Therefore, the increased production movement is inextricably linked to the savings movement, the frugality movement, and the waste utilization movement. They must be carried out simultaneously. Without saving and frugality, the financial and material resources needed for increased production cannot be gathered, and the results of increased production will only be wasted in vain and cannot be used for reproduction. Without knowing how to utilize waste, it is futile to talk about increased production today when raw materials are scarce.</p>
<p>The above is a very simple summary of the key points of the work to be done this year. I hope that all compatriots in the country will know and act consistently and achieve them step by step.</p>
<p>New Year's Message</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Prime Minister Tojo <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Now, as we celebrate the New Year of Showa 19, our 100 million people respectfully offer congratulations on His Majesty's longevity and pray for the prosperity of the Imperial Family and the nation, for which we are deeply grateful. Two years have passed since the declaration of war. Under the sacred authority of His Majesty, the skillful planning and courageous fighting of our soldiers, and the diligent and striving efforts of our 100 million people, have proclaimed the Imperial might to the world and have been gradually realizing the ideals of building Greater East Asia and establishing world peace. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War, as declared in the Imperial Rescript on the Declaration of War, is to seek self-preservation and self-defense for our country, to ensure the peace of East Asia, and to establish a world order of true universal prosperity, which is entirely based on our founding spirit. Our intention, which is the common ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia, has been clarified to the world by the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration adopted at the Greater East Asia Conference, which has declared the common will of all East Asians. Our soldiers enthusiastically set out, with the spirit of ramming enemy planes, made attacks with certainty of victory, or were completely annihilated, sacrificing themselves for the country, not expecting to return alive, and sparing no sacrifice for His Majesty the Great Commander.</p>
<p>The More Difficult, the More United</p>
<p>Domestically speaking, the more difficult, the more united we become. Our 100 million people have been working hard to enhance our war capabilities with vigorous spirit, which is vastly different from the enemy, Britain and the United States. Today, because the enemy, Britain and the United States, are trying to counterattack, the war situation has become extremely severe. The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War and the success or failure of the construction of Greater East Asia depend on crushing the counterattack of Britain and the United States. Therefore, our 100 million people have all made battle preparations, and without distinguishing between the front lines and the rear, we are united as one to defeat Britain and the United States. We uphold the Emperor of the unbroken line for ages eternal, and the results of having one sovereign and ten thousand subjects, and the whole country united as one mind, is that our国体 the national polity is also unparalleled in the world. Once something happens, all of our people will be determined to sacrifice themselves for the country, which is the tradition of our Imperial nation and the spirit of the Japanese people. Today is truly a good opportunity for our 100 million people to unite under the sacred authority of His Majesty, to exert all their efforts, and to display the talents of the Japanese people. His Majesty the Emperor, in order to eradicate the roots of disaster in East Asia and establish lasting peace in East Asia, is deeply concerned day and night. All of our people are extremely fearful, and we, our 100 million people, always uphold the Imperial mind and respond with the spirit of repaying the country with death, not hesitating to be crushed to pieces. Internally, we sacrifice the small self, eliminate friction, help each other, maintain strict personal conduct, encourage each other, and live a wartime life, so that after the entire body has made battle preparations, no one is left behind, and we can serve His Majesty the Emperor. Today, our European allies are fighting alongside us to defend against the enemy's counterattack, and their fighting spirit is becoming more and more vigorous. Now, in order to defeat Britain and the United States, they are making every effort to do so. We will crush all the enemy's schemes, strengthen our cooperation more closely, and respond and attack Britain and the United States from the East and the West, in order to achieve our common mission.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Defeat Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Furthermore, we express our deepest gratitude to all the countries and nations of Greater East Asia for their great efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War and build Greater East Asia. We also hope that the 1 billion compatriots of Greater East Asia will support each other, thoroughly defeat the invaders of East Asia, Britain and the United States, so as to build a Greater East Asia based on morality and contribute to world peace. As we welcome the return of spring and the renewal of all things, we would like to share with the people our belief in certain victory and strengthen the solidarity between our country and our East Asian allies in order to defeat Britain and the United States, which are attempting to dominate the world, and strive for final victory.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Commander-in-Chief Kondo of the Japanese Fleet in China <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>It has been three years since the flames of the Greater East Asia War were ignited, and we once again joyfully celebrate the New Year. Here, we remotely wish His Majesty a long life and the Imperial Family eternal prosperity, which is truly the supreme glory of our Yamato race.</p>
<p>This year is the year of the decisive battle, and it is also the autumn to mobilize the whole country to thoroughly crush all the enemy's attempts in order to complete the defeat of Britain and the United States. It is expected that the enemy, Britain and the United States, will also resort to various means and launch counterattacks, and the war situation will become more and more intense. In particular, it is not difficult to imagine that the enemy will deploy political and ideological strategies. Our people should hold a firm resolution to win, consolidate unity, and devote all their efforts to expanding production, transportation, and mobilizing manpower in their respective combat duties, whether on the front lines or in the rear, in order to defeat the military strength of Britain and the United States. In particular, we must achieve results in intelligent mobilization that Britain and the United States cannot even aspire to.</p>
<p>Within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the decisive battle formation centered on China, Japan, and Manchuria should be further strengthened to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of any gaps. Gathering the total strength of all the nations of Greater East Asia, we will take great strides in building Greater East Asia, and bravely advance towards the common mission of defeating Britain and the United States. Here, we pray that the gods will protect justice, and we vow to do our utmost in human affairs to achieve the objectives of the Holy War.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Ambassador Tani of Japan to China <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>At this time when the war is intensifying day by day, and the form of a decisive battle is increasingly imminent, we welcome the New Year of the third year of this campaign, first offering congratulations for the boundless longevity of His Majesty the Emperor, and the enduring prosperity of the Imperial Family. With a resolution to overcome the present difficult times, we will faithfully and sincerely devote ourselves to public service, vowing to spare no effort in completing the sacred task of our Imperial nation.</p>
<p>Looking back since the start of the war, in less than half a year, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States were completely expelled and swept away from their strongholds throughout East Asia, liberating the skies and lands of Greater East Asia. While Japan advanced the ideals of wartime construction, and continued to bravely and fiercely fight against Britain and the United States, it also worked according to principles of righteousness amidst the flames of war to achieve the great undertaking of constructing a new order in Greater East Asia. In this, the two independent nations of Burma and the Philippines have already been born, and the people of Indonesia have also gained a clear path to participate in politics. In addition, there is Thailand's expansion of its territory, and the spirit of a shared desire to contribute to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Furthermore, India, the greatest victim of British aggression in East Asia, has also established the Provisional Government of Free India, preparing itself to advance with dignity in the struggle for independence. In addition to declaring war on Britain and the United States last spring, the Republic of China also completed the abolition of the humiliating unequal treaties since the Opium War, achieving complete autonomy and independence, establishing itself as the foundation of a major nation in Greater East Asia. Moreover, in the autumn, it concluded an alliance treaty with the Empire, establishing an eternally friendly relationship between China and Japan, while the State of Manchuria, which protects the north, also enjoys increasing national strength. All of this is deeply cause for mutual celebration.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Empire's efforts regarding the construction of Greater East Asia have rapidly yielded practical results. For example, in the autumn, representatives of the six major independent nations of Greater East Asia gathered in one place to issue a historic joint declaration, which was an unprecedented grand event, and ensures something of which the one billion people of Greater East Asia can be eternally proud.</p>
<p>Moreover, the purpose of the Empire's war is to liberate East Asia, restore the freedom of East Asia, and build a new order of co-prosperity for the nations of East Asia. We firmly believe that only this kind of ideal does not contradict the history of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, and can contribute to the happiness of mankind. Conversely, the war aims of Britain and the United States, while claiming to ensure freedom, also intend to use the Atlantic Charter, which does not apply to the Pacific, does not grant freedom to India, and does not recognize the autonomous independence of the Philippines and Burma, and still wants to return the nations of East Asia to their former unfree state. In order to achieve these selfish war goals, they repeatedly counterattacked with an ostrich-like attitude, seemingly intending to make this year a decisive battle, aiming for large-scale operations and actions, so the seriousness of the situation is unprecedented. It is by no means an exaggeration to say that this is a year of the Empire's prosperity and the rise and fall of East Asia. At the New Year under this major decisive battle, we have infinite gratitude for the heroic souls who are the foundation of the sacred task of the Imperial nation. We further wish the Imperial soldiers fighting bravely in various places continued military success, and at the same time deeply hope that they will advance bravely with the spirit of resolutely changing the front line's operations, in order to complete the holy war.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Minister Tajiri of Japan to China <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Japan, for the sake of the liberation and independence of Greater East Asia, has been eliminating the Anglo-American ambition to dominate East Asia since [year missing], and we now happily welcome the New Year of the third year. In this year, we have continuously achieved brilliant great victories, and at the same time, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have also cooperated to promote the self-reliance and revival of Asia, which is truly gratifying.</p>
<p>For two years since the start of the war, the determination of Japan's one hundred million people and the joint determination of Greater East Asia's one billion have been completely unified. Not only is Anglo-America confronting the ironclad unity of Japan's one hundred million people, but it is also betraying the justice of Greater East Asia's one billion people. Today, the unfolding of the Greater East Asia War is precisely the deserved blow to the increasingly collapsing Anglo-American ambition. On the path of liberating Asia and achieving independence, it can truly be called the glorious sacrifice that Asia should make. The joint determination of Greater East Asia's one billion people was further elevated at the Greater East Asia Conference held in early November last year. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration explained the concepts and guidelines for building a new order in Greater East Asia and building a new world order without reservation. That is, the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia takes the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and harmony, cultural enhancement, economic prosperity, and further contribution to world progress for all countries and nations of Greater East Asia as guidelines. Under the new order currently being built, each country gets its place, relying on each other and helping each other, to achieve the happiness of universal co-prosperity.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty concluded before the Greater East Asia Conference was convened stipulates the permanent friendly relations between China and Japan, the axes of Greater East Asia. It was also clarified that the signing book for building a Greater East Asia based on morality should be centered on the close life-and-death cooperation between China and Japan. In the third year of the Greater East Asia War, under this spirit, it is a year of leaping development in the new relationship between China and Japan. It is also a year for the National Government to ensure security, rectify thinking, revive the economy, and actively increase production. The construction of the new order in Greater East Asia is increasingly progressing due to the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. However, we must remember that the completion of the new order in Greater East Asia is premised on completely crushing the Anglo-American ambition to dominate the world. Furthermore, the liberation and glory of Asia can only be obtained after the complete victory in the Greater East Asia War. Currently, the people should further consolidate their belief in certain victory, and unite with the one billion people of Greater East Asia, complete the joint determination to defeat Anglo-America, and strengthen their determination to build Greater East Asia. We will contribute all our efforts to enhance combat power. On this New Year's Day of the third year of the Greater East Asia War, I respectfully wish His Majesty long life, and at the same time, in the decisive battle to defeat Anglo-America, I vow not to stop until complete victory is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e47">A Message to the Citizens of Shanghai <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Gongbo</p>
<p>Dear citizens:</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Day of the 33rd year of the Republic of China, the beginning of a new year. On the occasion of wishing the citizens a happy new year, I dare to sincerely offer some words to all of you.</p>
<p>Today, I will not talk about the Greater East Asia War. We work hard day and night to fulfill the Greater East Asia War, to fulfill the liberation of the Greater East Asia nations and our own liberation, so we only have to do it, no need to talk about it anymore. Today, I will also not talk about Shanghai's municipal policy for this year, because the two concessions were recovered on July 30th and August 1st last year respectively, and municipal administration has been unified. Before and after the unification of municipal administration, I have said a lot to the citizens, and in the future, we only have to implement them earnestly, so there is no need to talk about them anymore. What I want to tell the citizens today is that there are things that the government should do this year, and there are things that the citizens should do. I sincerely hope to speak frankly, so that the government and the people can work together to build a clean and prosperous Shanghai.</p>
<p>Let me talk about what the government should do first. My personality is not to conceal or exaggerate. I tell you that Shanghai has reached a serious situation today. I have discovered a very abnormal thing in Shanghai, and at the same time, there is an even more contradictory thing. What is the abnormal thing? It is that the salaries of government officials are not enough to maintain their lives, the profits obtained by ordinary merchants according to their legitimate businesses are not enough to maintain their expenses, and even ordinary workers cannot make a living with the wages they earn each month or day. Therefore, the discipline is precarious, and the society is restless. This is an abnormal thing. What is the contradictory thing? In principle, we should produce in peacetime, and we should increase production in wartime, otherwise, the front line will not be able to get sufficient supplies, and the rear will not be able to get proper living, but Shanghai has reduced production due to a lack of fuel. In the past, we have also tried to be lazy to produce due to hoarding raw materials for profit. This is a contradictory thing.</p>
<p>Shanghai has an abnormal thing, plus a contradictory thing, so life cannot be normal, thinking is chaotic because of it, and the law sometimes loses its effectiveness, and perversion comes first, and if this continues, the whole society will be destroyed. To save this abnormality, to eliminate this contradiction, these are major things that the government should do. I, who hold the position of mayor, must find ways to remedy these questions, but my personal strength is limited. It will not be successful without the strength of all the people in the city, and it will not be successful without the combined efforts of the central government and the local government. For example, the soaring prices are due to the lack of materials, hoarding by private individuals, and the lack of unified price assessment agencies. Although there are many reasons, increasing production is the only way to remedy it. If we can continue to produce, private individuals will have no way to hoard, and the assessment of prices will naturally have a basis. Recently, I have tried my best to unify the price assessment agencies and have tried my best to crack down on hoarding, but to continue production, first, the interest rate on production funds must be low, second, the raw materials for production must be obtained, and third, the transportation methods must be flexible. We must raise production funds, the Shanghai financial community must work hard, and the central government must provide assistance. As for obtaining raw materials and making transportation methods flexible, the government should try its best to find ways. If the economic problems can be solved, then other problems can be solved smoothly. I firmly believe that there is no so-called politics other than economics, and the government must take full responsibility for this.</p>
<p>I can talk about what the citizens should do. Shanghai was originally a big city in the East, and also a big city in the world. Big cities have their advantages and disadvantages, so Shanghai is full of unavoidable disadvantages, which is to be expected. However, recently, Shanghai has become even more [idiom for indulging in extravagance and dissipation], like heading towards the setting sun, as if the end of the world is coming, using its last breath to revel. To this day, I believe that Shanghai's two major shortcomings, speculation and extravagance, should be corrected immediately. What I call speculation is not only the scramble to buy and sell gold and securities, but the soaring prices are also a kind of speculation. We must know that the economic state has its natural balance. The soaring price of one commodity will inevitably drive other commodity prices to rise at the same time. I see that the guilds of various industries only care about the current exorbitant profits and do not consider the future. The exorbitant profits of any industry will eventually be added to itself. Repeatedly stacking and rising will eventually lead to being overwhelmed and collapsing one day. I am very worried for the citizens. I don't know if you citizens also feel it? Secondly, the extravagant style is shocking. The slightest clothing, the cost of a meal, are all extremely extravagant. All marriages, funerals, banquets, and entertainment are so unrestrained and wasteful that ordinary people dare not believe it. I have been the mayor of Shanghai for three years. When I first arrived, I was wide-eyed and speechless. Today, I have become accustomed to seeing it for three years, but I still feel dizzy and palpitations. Because of this, I have repeatedly warned the citizens of Shanghai, but the speakers are sincere, and the listeners are indifferent. What I am most saddened by is not only that the citizens do not reflect on themselves and improve themselves, but that a small number of my subordinates also blindly follow evil. Without war, Shanghai will also sink.</p>
<p>Those who pursue profit must forget righteousness, and those who follow desires must forget shame. Shanghai has developed this kind of atmosphere, which naturally comes from somewhere. I advise the citizens of Shanghai that these Shanghai-style practices should also be corrected fundamentally in time. I deeply hope that in addition to being rich, Shanghai should also be educated. What I call education is not only that the school authorities should be responsible for guiding young people, but also that parents in the family and leading figures in the community should also lead by example and advocate for a clean world.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say a few words to the young people of Shanghai. When the anti-gambling, anti-smoking, and anti-dancing movements were launched in Shanghai, I happened to be in Nanjing. After I heard the news, I was really happy and afraid. I was happy because the youth could at least have a heart of distinguishing between good and evil, but I was afraid because I was afraid that the youth would go beyond the scope and give society a bad impression of youth disrupting order. Since returning to the capital, I have been teaching young people how to be human beings. Our China has reached the point of weakness today, nothing more than people insulting themselves, and then others insulting them. So I have two maxims: Revive China, starting from being a human being. In other words, if we ourselves don't know how to be human beings, and we want others to be human beings, it will never happen. Therefore, I hope that the youth will first learn to be human beings themselves. What I call the conditions for being a human being are also very simple, that is, being responsible, maintaining dignity, and seeking knowledge. Since the incident, Shanghai has not only changed in form but also in substance. Shanghai was already complex enough, and it has become even more complex since the incident. After I arrived in Shanghai in the 29th year, I advocated banning gambling. After many difficulties, gambling in western Shanghai was banned in the spring of the 30th year, which is well known. As for the southern city, I ordered it to be banned on March 29th in early December of last year. I made a resolution beforehand and contacted all parties afterward. As for dancing, it is relatively simple, but smoking is even more complex. As the mayor of the city, I deeply hate this kind of fact even more than the youth, because the youth only have enthusiasm, and I am even more responsible. Now that the matter has passed, I don't have to talk about it anymore. I only hope that the youth will resolve to lead by example, not only today, but also in the future when serving in society and in the government, they must also lead by example. Today, they must strictly observe discipline, and in the future, they must be self-disciplined. This is what I extremely expect of the youth.</p>
<p>In addition, I have one more thing to say to the general society of Shanghai. The youth movement is enthusiastic, and on the other hand, it clearly shows that Shanghai lacks a backbone of social leadership. When young people are in school, and they have this kind of radical action, it is obviously a symbol of social perversion. If society has a backbone and leads properly, young people can study at ease and do not have to be distracted by these extraneous things. I deeply hope that enlightened people in Shanghai society will come forward to take responsibility, assisting the government on one hand and leading the youth on the other, so that society can make progress every day, and the shortcomings of the big city can be remedied.</p>
<p>What I have said above is all that I have sincerely told my citizens. I take on the responsibilities that the government should bear, and each citizen should take on the responsibilities that citizens should bear. With the cooperation of officials and people, the construction of a clean and prosperous Shanghai is at hand. Let our citizens, on this occasion of the renewal of all things, rise up together to build this new Shanghai!</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Coal Panic Problem in Shanghai <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>What the residents of Shanghai feel most acutely today is the problem of food. However, the serious situation with grain has not yet been resolved, and the panic over fuel has followed, with a growing and intensifying trend. As the saying goes, "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice," which refers to the grain problem. There is also the saying, "It's hard to turn raw rice into cooked rice," which refers to the fuel problem. If we want to survive, we cannot avoid discussing the issue of "food." When we talk about "food," we cannot separate it from "grain" and "fuel." The grain problem has already been discussed extensively and thoroughly by scholars, so I don't need to repeat it. Therefore, I plan to discuss the "fuel problem" here.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, whether it is the coal briquettes necessary for households or the power needed for factories and public utilities, coal by weight is the main component. This article will mainly discuss household coal briquettes, but when describing the supply and consumption of coal by weight, it will also involve the coal needed for factories and public utilities, for the reference of interested parties.</p>
<p>I. The Consumption of Coal in Shanghai</p>
<p>The amount of coal consumed is closely related to the general social economy. Normally, the amount of coal consumed in Shanghai is about three million metric tons per year. According to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau's survey and statistics in the 23rd year of the Republic of China [1934], the consumption of coal in this city is greatest by factories, ships, and power companies, followed by households and railways. The following is a table listing the consumption of various industries, based on the Japanese translation "Shanghai in the Enterprise Zone":</p>
<p>Whether the above figures are verifiable and whether the statistics are detailed is questionable, but the general situation of coal consumption in this city is known. Later, after the August 13th Incident [Battle of Shanghai] occurred, many factories were damaged, and many factories were affected by the situation, suspending or reducing work. As a result, the consumption of coal decreased significantly. The Yamazaki Economic Research Institute once estimated the consumption of coal in Shanghai in December 1940 based on the power supply of the Shanghai Electric Power Company, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>If we calculate based on the above table, the total annual coal consumption in Shanghai is only over 600,000 metric tons. Even if we add the consumption of ships, railways, etc., the difference from before the incident is immeasurable. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Shanghai's foreign transportation has been completely cut off, and at the same time, the import of raw materials and domestic sales have been restricted by control. As a result, most industries have been affected, and work has been suspended or reduced. The amount of coal consumed has naturally decreased. According to the direct allocation quota of the Dazhong Lian Coal Company, statistics show that from July to the end of November in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942], 190.472 metric tons of various types of coal were allocated to Chinese industrial, commercial, and residential users in Shanghai. The average monthly allocation was 39.003 metric tons, for a total of 468.036 metric tons per year, which is even less than before and after the incident.</p>
<p>According to the above statistics, household coal accounts for 7.38% of the city's total consumption, and coal briquette factories account for 80.96%. The two together account for 88.34%. Factory coal accounts for only 11.64% of the total consumption, which shows the huge difference in their status between the past and the present. Now, we may as well assume that the coal consumption in Shanghai was 3 million metric tons per year before the incident, 1 million metric tons per year after the incident, and even more frugal at 700,000 metric tons per year after the outbreak of the Pacific War. A comparison with the annual coal supply situation in Shanghai will then easily reveal the truth.</p>
<p>II. The Supply of Coal in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an international commercial port in East Asia, the population has been concentrating day by day, and industry and commerce have been prospering day by day. As a result, the amount of coal needed has also been increasing day by day. Examining the source of coal in Shanghai, it has usually relied on North China, which often accounts for more than 90% of Shanghai's supply. However, since the August 13th Incident, the transportation of coal from North China to South China has been greatly affected, so dependence on foreign coal has increased year by year.</p>
<p>Before the incident, the main suppliers of domestic coal in Shanghai were the bituminous coal produced by Kailuan, Shandong, and Zhongxing companies, followed by the white coal from Hebei and Shanxi provinces. The coal production in central China, such as Huainan, can be said to be insignificant. After the incident, although the coal from Kailuan, Shandong, and Zhongxing still occupied the main position, the quantity has been drastically reduced. As for Shanxi coal, it has long disappeared in Shanghai, so we have to find ways to obtain it from Vietnam and other places, and the supply of Huainan bituminous coal has gradually become important.</p>
<p>Changes in Shanghai's Domestic Coal Supply Market (Unit: Metric Tons)</p>
<p>Note: The 1936 figures are based on a survey by a certain company; the 1940 figures are based on a survey by the South Manchuria Railway Company, so they do not match the figures in the previous table, but they can clarify the general situation.</p>
<p>The import of foreign coal was limited to the white coal from Hong Gai, Vietnam, followed by Japanese coal. Afterwards, because of the panic over bituminous coal, Indian bituminous coal also came to Shanghai in large quantities.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the situation has changed drastically. Overseas transportation has been cut off, and foreign coal naturally cannot continue to come, causing a great panic in Shanghai's fuel supply. Therefore, the Japanese authorities concerned are studying countermeasures for transporting coal from North China to Shanghai by land. As a result, the coal supply market in this city has formed the following situation:</p>
<p>Before the incident, the amount of coal arriving in Shanghai every day was about 10,000 metric tons. According to a survey by a certain company, the amount and source of coal arriving in Shanghai every day in the 31st and first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China [1942-1943] are shown in the following table:</p>
<p>The above-mentioned white coal arriving in Shanghai is all transported by land. A small part of the bituminous coal slag is still transported to Shanghai by ship to supply Chinese industrial, commercial, and household consumption in Shanghai (estimated at 39,003 metric tons per month, see the previous table). Although there is a surplus, the amount of coal used by the Japanese side, public utilities, and vehicles is roughly equal.</p>
<p>III. The Organization for Coal Control and Rationing in Shanghai</p>
<p>The organization for coal control and rationing in Shanghai began with the Shanghai Coal Federation, organized by Japanese merchants in Hongkou in July 1939, to transport coal from North China, Central China, Taiwan, Korea, and even Japan to Shanghai for use by Japanese merchants and military needs in Shanghai. At that time, it was under the jurisdiction of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board (now moved to the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy). Its duties were:</p>
<p>Deciding on the allocation of fixed quotas for the import of coal to members.</p>
<p>Deciding on the allocation of fixed quotas for the import of coal to different industries.</p>
<p>Deciding on the sales, ordering, and other prices of coal and handling its transportation.</p>
<p>Handling the investigation of coal supply and demand and production in China.</p>
<p>After that, in order to tighten the control over coal sales, the "Shanghai Coal Merchants Association" was re-established to handle the determination of sales prices; unification of retail industry; adjustment of supply and demand of household coal, etc. Soon after, the "Taiwan Coal Import Association" was also established. The former is an organization of retailers, and the latter specializes in importing Taiwan coal and determining its sales prices and adjusting supply and demand. Both are under the jurisdiction of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the coal supply and demand in this city became unbalanced, and the public was in panic. Under the guidance of the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, coal industry merchants in the concession area also established various control and rationing organizations, such as the "Dazhong Lian Coal Company," established on February 1, the "Shanghai Coal Industry Merchants Association," established on April 13, and the "Shanghai Coal Briquette Factory Association," established on May 5, all of which were under the control of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Coal Federation." All matters related to the determination of coal sales prices, research on coal transportation and supply and demand adjustment, unification of retailers, and cooperation among peers are all operated by the "Shanghai Coal Industry Merchants Association." All coal used by Chinese coal briquette factories and small Chinese factories in the concession area is operated by the "Dazhong Lian Coal Company." However, the coal required by Chinese coal briquette factories is directly distributed by the company. As for general household and industrial and commercial coal, it is distributed by the company to peers or retailers for distribution. The business of the "Shanghai Coal Briquette Factory Association" is to handle applications for coal allocation, determine production volume, unify product standards; determine sales prices; handle product transportation procedures; unify allocation organizations; research and adjust household fuel, etc. As a result, the coal control and rationing organization in Shanghai has formed the following system:</p>
<p>In addition, under the First District Office, there is a Coal Control Committee, which presides over the approval and issuance of permits. Under the Commercial Control Association, there is also an organization of the Coal Industry Federation, with coal companies and coal briquette companies as members. The control and rationing of coal is also related to the industry.</p>
<p>IV. The Development of the Recent Coal Briquette Panic</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of the supply and demand of coal in this city and its control and rationing. In recent years, everything has been presided over by friendly people, so the transportation of coal can arrive on time and be distributed fairly. Therefore, the supply of coal briquettes is very smooth and the price is very reasonable. However, in recent months (since October), the supply of coal briquettes has been decreasing day by day, and the panic of the people has been increasing day by day. Although the authorities have issued responsible remarks, hoping to stabilize people's hearts, the fact shows that the panic of coal briquettes has not only not been eliminated, but has become even more intense, arousing people's purchasing psychology. Although the official price of coal briquettes has increased from 32.5 yuan per dan (a unit of weight, about 100 catties or 50 kg) to 48 yuan, the black market price has been soaring day by day, with no end in sight. The threat to the survival of citizens can be said to have become extremely serious. If countermeasures are not sought promptly, there will be an unsustainable situation. The ferocity of the situation is not only above that of grain, but also triggers the rise of other commodity prices due to the launch of the coal briquette panic. According to the Shen Bao of October 31, "The shortage of coal briquettes in Shanghai this time is due to the following three main reasons: Manufacturers, citing high costs, requested a slight increase in selling prices, which was ultimately rejected by the authorities, so they reduced production. Distributors, due to the limited amount of spot goods available, but brisk sales, and the set profit is not enough to cover expenses, sold to the black market in order to obtain illegal profits. The source of coal slag has slightly decreased, and the authorities are adjusting the allocation mechanism, so the raw materials obtained by each factory are not as sufficient as in the past." This can be said to be a pinpoint analysis.</p>
<p>V. My Views on Putting Out the Coal Briquette Panic</p>
<p>In this year's November 6th Shen Bao National Forum, Wei Jun's article "Rethinking the Profit of Coal Briquettes" believes that "The main reason for this coal briquette panic is actually the authorities' reduction of coal slag allocation. According to the allocation quantity of the Coal Federation: the average allocation quantity in the first half of this year is almost three times that of the four months in the second half of the year, and the allocation quantity in July and August is 1.5 times that of September and October. May I ask, at this peak month of coal briquettes, how can manufacturers not be panicked when they get such scarce raw materials?" Wei Jun must be a person in the industry, and what he said must be accurate and based on evidence. This is the key to the coal briquette panic, and no one can object. However, according to the customs' coal import statistics over the years and comparing them with the annual consumption (both are shown in the previous table), even before 1937, the supply and demand were offset, and from 1938 to 1941, the surplus coal over the years should be around six to seven million metric tons. With the far-sightedness and effective management of Shanghai people, there is no reason to hoard all kinds of goods and only neglect coal. In addition to the storage for their own use by industrial and commercial companies, the amount of coal stored by coal briquette and coal industries must also be considerable. Mr. Zhang Yifan's investigation believes that a total of about 33,000 metric tons are accumulated (see page 31 of the sixth issue of the Chinese Industrial Monthly). However, the author's view is that even in today's coal shortage, the coal stored in Shanghai should be at least ten to one hundred times this number. It's just that the Coal Federation allocates it on a regular basis during normal times, and the quantity is quite sufficient, so there is no way to stir up trouble. They can only watch others make a fortune and sigh. Now, they seize the opportunity to reduce allocations and must take advantage of it, so the turmoil will expand so greatly! The author's countermeasures to put out the coal briquette panic can be discussed from both active and passive aspects: The active aspects can be discussed from the following four points:</p>
<p>A. Dredge the source. If the source of coal can be smooth, and the allocation of coal is not lacking, then the coal briquette manufacturers have no excuse, and the supply of coal briquettes can also be sufficient. Due to the impact of the war and the shortage of transportation tools, the authorities will of course have many difficulties in completing this task. However, they should know that fuel is related to the people's food and cannot be absent for a day, and its significant impact is beyond any expectation. We hope that the authorities will find ways to break the deadlock, increase production, and dredge the source in order to stabilize people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>B. Investigate inventory. If we compare the number of coal imports over the years according to customs and the amount of consumption over the years, there should be a large amount of coal stored in Shanghai. Even if the source is not smooth, we can use the inventory to get through the difficulties safely. There should never be a panic, and even if there is a panic, it should not be as serious as it is today. We ask the authorities to thoroughly investigate and handle this matter to appease the people.</p>
<p>C. Crack down on the black market. Although it is said that to buy ten or five catties of coal briquettes according to the official price in Shanghai is as difficult as climbing to the sky, as long as there are enough banknotes, it is easy to buy one or two tons from the black market. If it is said that coal briquettes are really lacking, then where do the black market coal briquettes come from? Moreover, coal briquettes are not like grain. Except for coal briquette manufacturers who can hoard for profits, there is no production in the surrounding countryside. The current panic is caused by merchants seeking profits and disregarding laws and regulations. It is difficult to find other reasons. We hope that the authorities will break through affection and vigorously crack down and severely punish them. Not only can the coal briquette panic be quelled, but other commodity prices can also fall because of it!</p>
<p>D. Adjust profits. What coal briquette manufacturers care about is the thickness of profits. If the profits of various commodities have been increased a lot, but the profits of coal briquette manufacturers are uniquely thin, it will definitely lead to their dissatisfaction. If they propose a request that is ineffective, they will definitely find ways to retaliate.</p>
<p>Passive aspects can also be discussed from the following five points:</p>
<p>A. Conserve consumption. During wartime, the supply of all materials is primarily for the needs of the front line. Even if there is a surplus of materials, they should be saved for use. What's more, the source of coal is not smooth, and the coal briquette panic is becoming more and more serious. Today, people should try to find ways to conserve the consumption of coal briquettes as much as possible, so that supply and demand can be adjusted and the current difficulties can be overcome.</p>
<p>B. Use substitutes. Although it is said that the consumption of coal briquettes has been conserved to the point where it cannot be conserved any further, the supply of coal briquettes is still insufficient. In this kind of environment, people must first ask to fill their stomachs before they can serve the country. Under these circumstances, using other substitutes as fuel is also a method in the absence of a method. Mountain firewood, bean firewood, charcoal, and firewood boards can certainly be used a lot. Even old newspapers, after being soaked, torn into strips, added with coal slag, and rubbed into balls, have an even more remarkable effect. The people of Shanghai may wish to try it.</p>
<p>C. Public coal stoves. This is also a method in the absence of a method, and people will definitely feel many inconveniences when it is implemented. However, if there is a real shortage of coal briquettes, in order to get through the current difficulties, we can only gather several like-minded families to live together and cook together. Whether it is vegetables, rice, or tea, we all use the same coal stove to fire up, and it will definitely have a great effect on the conservation of coal briquettes!</p>
<p>E. Eliminate the people's psychology of competing for purchases. As long as there are rumors in the market, people will be suspicious, frightened, and compete to purchase. If the people purchase a little more and prevent it from happening, the balance of supply and demand will immediately crack. The coal briquette panic this time also has this phenomenon. Those who are wealthy and purchase early are smug, while those who are poor and powerless are sad and have to work hard to find ways. All these phenomena fall into the trap of coal briquette manufacturers and are deceived and used by them. If we can follow the usual situation, without any panic in our minds, and without buying sooner or later, even if there is a shortage of coal briquettes, it will never lead to today's purchase. How to earnestly explain to the people and make them know the harm of competing for purchases seems to be something that the authorities should find ways to guide, and the people should also have self-awareness!</p>

<h3 id="e50">The Current Stage of People's Livelihood Issues <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiong Hua</p>
<p>The evolution of people's livelihood issues has reached an extremely serious stage recently. On one hand, everyone is struggling under the heavy pressure of commodity prices, and on the other hand, everyone is panicking about the shortage of supplies. From the perspective of commodity prices, the main issue is how to curb inflation. From the perspective of supplies, the main issue is how to improve control. If we can properly address the core of these two issues, then the entire people's livelihood problem will be largely solved. Other minor issues can be easily resolved. Observing the government's measures in the past, it seems that it has never paid attention to the root cause of the people's livelihood problem, and has focused solely on minor issues such as restricting prices and preventing hoarding. If the currency value is stable, prices will be limited without restriction; if supplies are smooth, hoarding will be prevented without prevention. This kind of superficial treatment only causes social unrest and public unease. As a result, price limits are repeatedly exceeded, and hoarding still prevails. If the people's livelihood problem cannot be addressed with a fundamental solution, then the lives of the people will naturally become increasingly miserable, and their trust in the current government will also be shaken. In the current environment, to solve the people's livelihood problem, it is necessary to obtain Japanese assistance; what attitude and what method should Japan use to help China solve the current people's livelihood problem? The following article will examine the currency problem, the control problem, and other problems that are the crux of the people's livelihood problem. Japan's proper attitude and assistance are also discussed.</p>
<p>I. Currency Issues</p>
<p>The scope of currency issues also includes credit currency. According to the business report published by the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, the number of banks has increased to 167 and the number of native banks to 169 by the end of October. The financial industry takes the granting and receiving of credit as its business. To what extent have these bankers and native bankers inflated credit? What kind of stimulus has this had on commodity prices? This seems to be a question worthy of consideration. The authorities may have already noticed this and repeatedly ordered restrictions on the establishment of small banks, but what is the effect? One cannot help but have doubts. Furthermore, the quantity of currency is not limited to the sum of cash and credit currency; its turnover rate has the greatest determining effect. In this time of skyrocketing commodity prices and rampant speculation, currency transactions are naturally very frequent. From the standpoint of currency turnover rate: Suppose that within a certain period, 100,000 yuan of currency is used as a medium of exchange for ten transactions, then in terms of currency quantity, it is equivalent to 1 million yuan of currency. Therefore, not only can the expansion of the amount of cash in circulation stimulate commodity prices, but credit currency and the turnover rate of currency can also stimulate commodity prices invisibly. The act of equating one Central Reserve Bank note to two in May of the 31st year of the Republic of China only paid attention to the quantity of cash. This view was too narrow. What were the consequences? They are already obvious to all.</p>
<p>In times of war, expanding the currency to obtain manpower and resources is an unavoidable act. After currency inflation, how to restore commodity prices to their original balance? There are only two ways: The first is to increase resources so that resources increase along with the currency, so that the original ratio between currency and resources can be maintained, and commodity prices will not rise. The second is to find a way to recover the inflated part of the currency so that the original ratio between currency and resources is maintained, and commodity prices will not rise. During wartime, hoping to increase resources as a means of suppressing commodity prices is certain to result in more disappointment than hope. Only the second method, making the greatest effort to recover the expanded portion after the currency has been inflated, is effective. If once the currency is inflated, the inflated part cannot be recovered, then resources will decrease in comparison, and commodity prices will rise instead. During the second conscription of manpower and resources, more currency must be paid as a price. If there is no suitable method to shrink the inflated currency for a long period of time, it will become a phenomenon in which currency and commodity prices are mutually causal and mutually stimulating. The result will not stop until it is beyond repair. Before the September 18th Incident, when Zhang Zuolin was in Guanwai, he inflated the currency (referring to the Fengtian currency at the time) to exchange for agricultural products, and then transported the agricultural products to foreign countries to exchange for military supplies. In this cycle, less and less agricultural products were collected, and more and more Fengtian currency was issued. The more Fengtian currency issued, the more expensive agricultural products became, and the more expensive agricultural products became, the more Fengtian currency was issued. At the time of the September 18th Incident, the black market once saw one silver dollar exchanged for eighty yuan of Fengtian currency. This can be said to be a precedent of being able to issue but not recover. This example is of course an inappropriate analogy to the current situation, but the point of being able to issue but not recover can be a lesson for future generations!</p>
<p>The crux of the current currency problem: First, the currency does not have a clear guarantee. Relying solely on the government's credit is not enough to gain the trust of the people. Second, the credit currency portion and the turnover rate portion stimulate commodity prices secretly, and cannot be effectively suppressed. Third, there is no effective way to shrink the currency. The first point is a basic problem, which can be said to be unsolvable in the current situation. If we say that we should find a way to link with the Japanese yen, the situation of material exchange between Japan and North China is very different from that between Japan and Central China, and it seems difficult to imitate the North China method. Regarding the second point, we cannot but ask the government to strictly prohibit the establishment of financial enterprises and strictly restrict the activities of established financial institutions. In this regard, the China United Reserve Bank has already effectively managed financial enterprises in North China, which can be used as a reference. Regarding the third point, there are of course various difficulties in recovering currency in a proactive way. It seems possible to reduce the pressure on the quantity of currency in a passive way. China is not directly involved in the war, and it may also be an effective way to reduce the quantity of currency to save as much as possible on military and government expenses. We are often surprised by these overlapping and redundant agencies and organizations. In addition to emptying the national treasury, what benefits do they actually bring to the national economy and the people's livelihood? The country's political economy and everything else cannot be solved by simply adding agencies. It is no longer necessary to explain what path the national finance is moving towards. Rather than supporting many redundant officials, why not drastically reduce government spending? This can reduce some of the currency pressure.</p>
<p>II. Control Issues</p>
<p>Nowadays, it seems that everyone likes to talk about planned economy, and they cannot wait to kick free economy ten thousand eight thousand miles away. The comparison of the advantages and disadvantages of planned economy and free economy is another issue. However, is planned economy suitable for the Chinese national character? It seems that no one has noticed this point. It is understandable that foreigners who do not understand the Chinese national character advocate a planned economy; it is truly perplexing that the Chinese authorities have also forgotten the national character of their own country and echo the planned economy in unison. The traditional Chinese national character can be said to be that of a people who love freedom the most. The meaning of freedom here is willfulness, comfort, and being unconstrained. There are many hermits and high-minded people in history who were unwilling to serve the world, not necessarily because the ruler was昏庸 and the world was chaotic, but mainly because they were governed once they became officials. The so-called official is 管也(to govern). They lost their willful and comfortable lives. Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bend his waist for five dou of rice, so he fled from his official position and returned to farming, and wrote an eternal masterpiece, "The Return." The idea of liberalism is not only deeply ingrained in the scholar-official class, but also well-versed in the rest of the general public. The Chinese people's lack of meddling, not keeping time, and not following order can all be said to be the dark side of a long period of liberal life. In politics and economics, they also emphasize freedom and laissez-faire, the so-called "I sit upright and the world is governed." The more changes there are in history, the more chaos is created. For example, Wang Anshi's New Policies in the Song Dynasty were of course beyond reproach from the perspective of pure rule of law; however, the spirit of the rule of law fundamentally conflicted with the traditional freedom and laissez-faire, resulting in soaring prices and the failure of the New Policies. Therefore, the traditional spirit of officialdom in China takes political clarity and simple laws as a beautiful story. If the Chinese national character cannot be understood and the effective control methods of Japan are brought to China to imitate blindly, then on the one hand, it will only open up a way for corrupt officials to make money, and on the other hand, it will only increase the resentment of the people. We see people in uniforms stopping people in the street to collect tolls, and we also see delays and deductions in the distribution of goods; we cannot help but sigh, "Control! Control! All kinds of sins in China are carried out in your name!"</p>
<p>Japan is now at a time when it is fighting for survival with Britain and the United States. Leaving aside past grievances, from the standpoint of race and geography, we must of course provide considerable assistance. However, this assistance has a principle: that is, "take what it needs, and let it have the rest." What materials does Japan need after all? And how much does it need? Whether it is controlled purchase or free purchase, China should supply as much as possible. Apart from this, let Chinese merchants freely transport and sell goods. Furthermore, materials that Japan does not need should be freely bought and sold. Control is not necessary, and distribution is even more meddlesome. In recent years, the terms control and distribution have long been intimidating. Planned economy has its own theoretical value, but if there is a way to govern but no one to govern, it will only become a sham. If it is implemented improperly, the one who plays with fire will be burned by fire in the end. Both the Chinese and Japanese authorities should be careful.</p>
<p>The control issue is accompanied by the issue of material exchange between the North and the South. The recent sharp rise in commodity prices is due to the sharp rise in coal prices. The rise in coal prices is due to the lack of sources. However, North China's coal production is indeed sufficient for Japan and North China, but because it cannot be freely transported and sold, it is difficult to come south. Conversely, food from Central China cannot be transported north for the same reason. North China is experiencing a food shortage and Central China is experiencing a coal shortage; is it in line with the wishes of the Chinese people to forcibly divide China into several political and economic regions and block them with controlled currency and monetary barriers? What impression does this policy have on the Chinese people? The wise authorities in Japan seem to be able to consider it again and again. The Su-Huai area has now implemented the simultaneous circulation of the United Reserve Bank notes and the Central Reserve Bank notes, and the obstacles to remittance between North China and Central China have long been criticized by merchants. Since the exchange rate between the United Reserve Bank notes and the Central Reserve Bank notes has been determined to be 18 to 100, can it be used as an exchange rate? If there is unlimited remittance, it will inevitably affect the circulation quantity of the United Reserve Bank notes. Can legitimate merchants be given extremely lenient applications for remittance? At a stage when the people's livelihood problem is extremely serious, the exchange of materials and the issue of remittance between Central China and North China should be considered urgently.</p>
<p>III. Other Issues</p>
<p>The evolution of the Sino-Japanese issue to the present is definitely not a time to avoid illness and seek medical treatment. If the Sino-Japanese dispute cannot be resolved reasonably before the end of the world war, then regardless of Japan's victory or defeat in the world war, the Sino-Japanese dispute will continue. To solve the China problem, the first thing to do is to see clearly who are the backbone of China and further adapt to their thoughts and wishes. The backbone of China, in addition to intellectuals, can be said to be the bourgeoisie. Some of these bourgeois elements have evolved from warlords and bureaucrats, and some have been created by landlords and merchants. After thirty years of frequent wars, their unanimous feeling is that agricultural capital or land capital is no longer suitable for the times. What they dream of is that China will rapidly become modernly industrialized and that their capital will be based on modern industrialization. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, has Japan been able to grasp the wishes of the Chinese bourgeoisie and adapt to them? Do the various measures taken by Japan in the peace zone make the Chinese bourgeoisie feel that they are not hindering China's modern industrialization? The Chinese national character attaches great importance to private property, and all actions that hinder the development of their private property are regarded as evil. What impression do all management, control, cooperation, and borrowing make on the Chinese people? It seems that a review is necessary. Furthermore, are the many national policy companies in Japan not equated with the East India Company by the Chinese people? These issues seem to be close to theoretical aspects, but they also account for a considerable proportion in solving China's people's livelihood problem. From the perspective of solving the Sino-Japanese issue, it can be said that it occupies an absolutely important position.</p>
<p>In the current environment, China naturally needs Japan's cooperation to solve the current people's livelihood problem. For the sake of the permanent interests of the Chinese and Japanese nations, Japan's economic policy towards China must have a 180-degree turn. The Chinese nation is the most realistic nation. Diplomatic rhetoric or propaganda articles can only elicit a mocking smile. Only personal interests can make them feel gratitude or resentment. If Japan grasps this point and promptly assists China in stabilizing its currency value, improving control, and withdrawing unnecessary operations, then the current people's livelihood problem will naturally have hope of recovery, and the impression on the people will be incomparable to alliances or declarations. The general goodwill of the people is even more undoubtedly a great force in resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute.</p>
<p>In summary: To solve the current people's livelihood problem, it is necessary to strictly manage currency and reduce the scope of control. On the Japanese side, it is especially important to grasp the wishes of the bourgeoisie and the general public and re-examine their economic policy towards China. Then all minor issues, such as distribution and price limits, can be easily solved. Otherwise, the people's livelihood problem will inevitably become a hopeless disease. The wise authorities of China and Japan should turn back as soon as possible.</p>
<p>From both material and spiritual aspects</p>
<h3 id="e51">Cultivating New Life <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yongcan</p>
<p>Everything in the universe, in all its diverse forms, can be summarized into two laws: one is the conservation of matter and energy, and the other is the evolution of metabolism. War, decline, peace, recuperation, reproduction, prosperity - this cycle of generations can be explained by metabolism, and even more so by the history of the past few centuries. However, to achieve peace, to achieve a victorious peace, and to promote national strength after peace, one must have indestructible matter and indestructible energy, and continue to struggle and strive unceasingly. And currently, the most serious problems of people's livelihood, the root cause of poverty and disease, and the remedies for them, should be the top priority.</p>
<p>Over the past year, whether we look at it from the perspective of culture, politics, economy, or especially the people's livelihood, we can see that everything has lost its vitality. The violent indulge in their plunder, the fake authorities wield their claws, and merchants value profit, hoarding and speculating, doing everything possible. As a result, refugees fill the roads, sorrowful cries are heard everywhere, and they even go further to act perversely and commit crimes. These chaotic and painful phenomena can be seen in every street and alley. On the other hand, some "opportunistic" heroes, after accumulating vast fortunes, indulge in sensual pleasures, supporting major entertainment venues. But, regardless of singing stages, dance pavilions, brothels, or gambling dens, they are all bustling with activity, reaping a hundredfold profit. However, this kind of abnormal business not only fails to conceal the darkness of society, but on the contrary, exposes the sins of humanity. To correct this abnormal state, on the one hand, we earnestly expect capable officials and enlightened governance; on the other hand, we should synchronize with politics and education to promote the self-awakening of the entire nation.</p>
<p>Speaking of the current problems of people's livelihood, the most threatening are nothing more than the four necessities of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Among them, the issue of food is the most serious. We can't talk about fine clothes and delicacies; we don't even hope for sufficient clothing and food. What we want to discuss is how to solve the basic problems for millions of citizens, such as the minimum requirement of warm clothing, red rice for sustenance, peaceful living, and unimpeded travel. Based on the principle of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the remedial measures that depend on the government are presented below:</p>
<p>Smooth Transportation to Balance Supply and Demand, Develop Industries to Open Up Sources of Profit</p>
<p>Shanghai's trade gathers products from all over the country. The paints, medicinal materials, bamboo, wood, and porcelain from Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei; the cotton, hemp, wheat, leather, tobacco, coal, soybeans, corn, and sorghum from the provinces of North China; the salt, sugar, fruits, and seafood from Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang; the silk, tea, rice, cotton, paper materials, and vegetables from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian. The distant ones come from thousands of miles away, taking more than a month; the near ones also come from hundreds of miles away. The roads are long, and in this time of war and chaos, there are many dangers and obstacles. At the same time, Shanghai's cotton, hemp, wool, silk, and other textiles; flour, hardware, machinery, cigarettes, and other commodities cannot maintain normal exports. Goods are stagnant, finance is strangely lacking, and illegal merchants take advantage of the opportunity to manipulate the market. Maintaining the original state of production is already impossible, let alone increasing it. To solve this problem, we must first conduct a thorough investigation of the production and consumption quantities, and the total inventory of goods in various places, and set a deadline for the investigation. Then, the state should manage transportation matters, increase transportation tools, open up new routes, remove all obstacles along the way, and maintain supply and demand in various places. Merchants should be given reasonable profits under the guidance of the government to handle distribution. The distribution quantity should be enough to keep people warm and fed, while private business and the sale of luxury goods should be subject to heavy taxes. If the wealthy class wants to live a more comfortable life, they can buy from those stores at a high price. After transportation is properly resolved and people's lives are secure, we need to further discuss the basic issue of how to increase the total production of daily necessities and light industry. This is briefly described in sections below:</p>
<p>(A) Agricultural Issues Agriculture is the root of all daily necessities, so improving the countryside is worthy of attention. Gather talents, investigate the soil, fertilizer, climate, rainfall, and seeds in various places, and based on the results of the investigation, determine what kind of plants should be planted in each place and what kind of fertilizer should be used. Then, study the improvement of agricultural tools and irrigation, the prevention of various natural disasters, and the improvement of storage after harvest, to reduce losses from insect damage and rot. Although this may seem a bit circuitous, if we intensify our work, results will be evident in less than two years.</p>
<p>(B) Industrial Issues Currently, most factories across the country are almost in a state of semi-shutdown. The government's resolute control of the yarn and cloth trade is something that the people are all cheering about. The regrettable thing is that there are no follow-up measures and these factories are not being utilized. We hope that not only yarn and cloth should be controlled, but also factories for fuel, flour, chemical raw materials, mining, cement, electricity, machinery, electrical machinery, etc., should be taken over by the government. We also hope that experts will be hired with swift means to focus on refining them. Both quality and quantity must be planned and aggressively pursued. If there is surplus capacity, new industries can be established in appropriate locations according to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Outline and National Reconstruction Strategy. At the same time, all factories must maintain contact to increase production efficiency. The design and construction of this kind of enterprise is certainly not easy, but if the country is to be revitalized and people's livelihood is to be abundant, this is an unavoidable path.</p>
<p>(C) Educational Issues Regarding academic subjects, I believe that above the specialized college level, we should focus on gathering and introducing the culture of other countries, understanding the principles thoroughly, practicing the techniques, and cultivating practical specialized talents. In secondary schools, in addition to teaching various basic subjects, we should instill wartime education and implement civic training. Girls' schools should preferably have supplementary courses in relief expansion and practical training in household chores. Primary schools should focus on ideological training and physical training, so that primary school students will not go astray at the starting point of their thinking, and at the same time develop their habit of doing morning exercises every day. These points can perhaps be done in public schools, but what about private schools? Don't think that the cultivation of outstanding individuals is not as urgent as other issues. You should know that the reason why the current society is so chaotic is mainly due to the degeneration of character. I ask the readers, who can claim to be "at least a citizen who is not ashamed of the country"? Achieving merit is even more out of the question. Regarding the treatment of teachers, everyone is aware of it. It is said that teachers teach extra classes in various schools, and also work as tutors after class. Some teachers have as many as seventy-two hours of teaching per week, an average of twelve hours per day, plus rushing here and there, they are so busy that they can barely breathe. This not only reduces the effectiveness of education, but also lowers the status of teachers. The remedies are nothing more than national subsidies and reporting illegal academic merchants. Otherwise, if this continues, the future of education is truly unimaginable.</p>
<p>As for the problems of housing and transportation, although they are quite serious now, after the problems of clothing and food are solved, thieves will be eliminated, refugees will disappear, second landlords will no longer rely on rent income to maintain their lives, and we will no longer sigh loudly, "The road to Sichuan is difficult," and "It is not easy to live in Chang'an."</p>
<p>Abandon Idleness to Enrich Livelihoods, Teach Thrift to Conserve Financial Resources</p>
<p>Everyone knows that to solve the problem of people's livelihood, relying solely on increasing revenue is not enough. In addition to increasing revenue, we must also supplement it with reducing expenditure. The so-called abandoning idleness and teaching thrift, although seemingly empty, are the inevitable starting points for reducing expenditure. Judging from the viewpoint of "spending a hundred yuan on a cup of coffee on Christmas Eve," one can measure the extent to which the wealthy class has become extravagant. People's desires are endless; everyone hopes for fine clothes and delicacies; arbitrary spending leading to financial ruin and death is also something everyone understands; but why is it that spending thousands of gold on a meal and tens of thousands of gold on clothing has become a common occurrence? The reason is very simple: it is because of a certain contradictory psychology that disrupts the nerves of the entire citizenry. The so-called contradictory psychology is "suspicion about the future." No one can predict what will happen tomorrow, but the daily increase in the cost of living is certain. Money! Money! There is no benefit in hiding money. Spending a hundred yuan on a cup of coffee this Christmas may mean that even plain water will not be available next year. Let's enjoy today's wine and worry about firewood and rice tomorrow! This is not right! If this tendency towards extreme and abnormal thinking continues to spread, then relying on the "fine clothes and delicacies are the shame of gentlemen" on the wall will not be very effective in reversing the decline. The actions of those in power are seen and heard by the people; frugality comes from the upper classes, and the spirit moves the lower classes. "National extravagance should be shown with frugality" is the first step. Cultivate the people's sense of hope and competition; do not allow talented people to remain undiscovered, while those who are illiterate rely on the manipulative skills of the "three no-cares" (not caring about the country, not caring about the people, and not caring about reputation) to strut around, demoralizing the ambitious and shortening the courage of heroes. This is the second point. Promote legitimate entertainment, such as sports meets, concerts, various craft competitions, and publicly reward opinions and plans from various industries. Make the most of spare time. This is the third step. Absolutely prohibit gambling. Just look at the pawnshops next to the gambling dens, a dozen in a row, and you will know that gambling is truly the source of all evil and must be eradicated. This is the fourth step. In short, the so-called reducing expenditure is not only about wealth, but also about not wasting a single second of time.</p>
<p>Establish Prestige to Win Public Trust, Clarify Governance to Rectify Discipline</p>
<p>These two points are political issues that seem to have nothing to do with people's livelihood. However, the government is an organization formed by the people, used to manage the people internally and represent the country externally. Therefore, the government's measures have a close relationship with the people's livelihood. Orders not being followed or promises not being kept can weaken the people's prestige towards the government. Let's give two examples: In order to solve the problem of clothing and food for the citizens, there are organizations for the distribution of food and daily necessities. Recently, after the control of yarn and cloth and the shortage of coal briquettes, these two necessities may also be distributed, which is something that every citizen is eagerly hoping for. However, past events tell us that the so-called distribution and the so-called price limits have instead promoted the growth of illegal black markets. What is used as a good strategy to adapt to the wartime environment in other countries has the opposite effect in our country. The Rice Control Association has been reorganized three times, and the results have deteriorated each time. After the third takeover, the person in charge seemed to have said, "There is not much inventory at present. When the new goods are on the market in early November, there will be enough food to distribute to the citizens, and the price must be slightly higher." What was the result? Some time ago, the government sent senior officials to investigate the market situation. As a result, they came with great enthusiasm and left quietly. Shanghai is still the same Shanghai. These kinds of similar facts are truly too many to mention. As the saying goes, "If trust is established above, the people will naturally trust it." One can not be an official, but one cannot neglect one's duties, and one cannot lose prestige. Zihu wrote directly, "Zhao Dun killed his lord," and was praised as a good historian. Conversely, once trust is lost, and one uses superficial words and tricks to win over the world, the country's future is truly unimaginable. Therefore, I hope that the government can resolutely and decisively, with the posture of a long spear and a large spear, and the surgery of a quick knife cutting hemp, rectify discipline. The specific methods should start from clarifying official governance, prohibiting corrupt officials, eliminating redundant personnel, and saving public funds.</p>
<p>Currently, most civil servants can be classified into two types: "acting recklessly" and "not acting." "Acting recklessly" makes society move in the wrong direction and puts the people in an even more painful situation. These administrative personnel are not only insufficient to manage the people, but can even be called traitors to the people. At the same time, they also reduce the people's faith in the government. For the sake of the people and for the sake of the government, it is worthy of thorough investigation and strict punishment. "Not acting" prolongs the chaotic situation, prevents the old environment from being broken, and causes the country's public funds to be wasted meaninglessly. At the same time, it reduces administrative efficiency. I hope the government can fairly reduce personnel. As for new officials taking office and old officials leaving, welcome! Celebrate! If it does not harm the national image, it can be reduced as much as possible. If those in power can lead by example in this way and teach the people to be thrifty, it can not only save a sum of money, but also transform the people's customs!</p>
<p>The above six points are just a brief overview. Other details are truly too many to write down. In short, a bright and splendid new life is not a fortunate gain without any cost. We must mobilize all our energy, time, and materials, and start by solving the problem of people's livelihood and increasing production. To increase production, although transportation (or commercial) issues are the initial step, agricultural and industrial issues should be the foundation; political and educational issues should be the driving force; and then supplemented by diligence, thrift, personality cultivation, and spiritual training, success can be achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e52">From Controlled Materials to How to Improve People's Livelihood <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Naiquan</p>
<p>The Meaning of Control</p>
<p>"Controlled materials" is a policy that every warring country uses to deal with emergencies. Its entire role, in the negative aspect, is to restrict consumption, save materials, and stabilize prices. In the positive aspect, it attempts to use the materials and labor saved to strengthen the production work necessary for wartime. Therefore, a sound control system must be able to exert the above two aspects of the role, but now our control system, in the negative aspect of the role can be brought into play, is already fortunate. As for the positive aspect of the role, we can not talk about now.</p>
<p>The Current Situation of Control</p>
<p>The current soaring prices, the existence of black markets, and the activity of smuggling tell us that "control" has failed. The reason why today's control of materials has failed is not the poor control system, but the improper implementation of control of materials. The reason why the implementation of control of materials is not proper is not the imperfections of the guidelines and methods for controlling materials, but the lack of determination and perseverance of those responsible to serve the people. Therefore, to improve today's people's livelihood is not a question of whether it can be done, but a question of whether it is done. To put it thoroughly, the fact that today's people's livelihood cannot be resolved is the fault of those responsible, "not that they cannot do it, but that they do not do it." By observing the crux of today's control of materials, we can know.</p>
<p>The following three points, although not the only reason why today's people's livelihood cannot be resolved, are at least places we cannot ignore:</p>
<p>Failure to Adjust Supply and Demand — To give an example, in the past four months, the allocated rice for households has only been eight periods of eight liters. Eight liters of rice is not enough to maintain for four months, so in fact, people have to rely on the black market. Recently, the black market price of rice is very high, while the producers in the rice-producing areas only get more than eight hundred yuan per stone. Logically, the producers in the rice-producing areas should be happy. But it is not so, they are hoping for Shanghai's cheap (comparative) soap, cloth (black market), cigarettes, candles, matches, etc. How do we know they need these? Just look at what the single vendors bring. What single vendors bring to the rice-producing areas are these daily necessities, and what they bring up are the grains we need, because Shanghai is an industrial area, producing these daily necessities, and needing agricultural products. But because of the relationship of control, materials cannot circulate. Therefore, in Shanghai, grain is strangely expensive. Conversely, in agricultural areas, what is produced is grain, and what is lacking are daily necessities. Also because materials cannot circulate, in the agricultural areas, soap costs more than thirty yuan per bar, cigarettes, which cost only four or five yuan in Shanghai, also cost sixteen or seventeen yuan per pack, and the most basic foreign cloth costs forty or fifty yuan per foot. As for industrial supplies (for small cities) such as dyes, they are even more expensive. From this, it can be seen that today's high prices in industrial and agricultural areas are not due to a true lack of materials, but to the non-circulation of materials. This cannot but be said to be the failure of the control organs to do their best. Originally, the principle of controlling materials was not to block the circulation of materials, because only when materials can circulate can distribution be average and smooth, and the situation of supply and demand will be balanced, so prices will not rise and fall sharply, and the high and low values in various places will not be too disparate. Furthermore, in wartime, what we hope for is stable people's livelihood, not to solve people's livelihood from now on.</p>
<p>Reduced Production — In wartime, we need to work hard to produce. We should never reduce production. Increasing production is one of the goals of controlling materials, but today's control system has not only failed to increase production, but has instead done its best to reduce production. For example, the current organs for controlling materials use their privileges to buy materials in various rural areas at very low prices, often making people not only unable to profit, but also lose money. In this way, they are naturally unwilling to work harder to increase production. In fact, they no longer have the capital to increase production. This is the so-called "low prices hurt farmers."</p>
<p>Turn to Page Four</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>But farmers feed the best white rice to pigs and dogs (this happened in Jiangbei), while city dwellers eat real pig and dog food. Under such circumstances, rural areas are reducing production due to "low prices hurting farmers," while many factories in cities are cutting workers or reducing working days due to insufficient food rations or raw materials, and are also trending towards reduced production. As a result of reduced production in all areas, prices will rise again.</p>
<p>Lack of Honest People in Charge — Originally, control organs are organs that seek survival for the country and happiness for the people. They are definitely not profit-making organs, but according to recent economic scholars published in Tokyo, "They often abuse the privileges granted by the authorities and strive to pursue profits." This is truly a heartbreaking thing for those with a conscience. The reason why today's people in charge lack the determination and perseverance to serve the people is nothing more than the following two points:</p>
<p>(A) Insufficient Understanding of Today's Government They think that what I am doing today is not for the country or the people at all. To be honest, it is entirely to solve my own life problems. They are disloyal to the National Government and despise the National Government. These are originally problems of different opinions or different positions. The so-called "the sea has its stench-loving people." This is not a problem of people's livelihood, so we don't need to talk about it. But they pursue profits greatly based on their goal of solving their own life problems, and it is our people who suffer. This is the subjective reason for not wanting to serve the people.</p>
<p>(B) Lack of Courage to Overcome Environmental Resistance Of course, we cannot say that the objective environment of today's control system is without resistance. There are more resistances that our people cannot know. Even we ourselves have not yet sincerely cooperated with the control organs. So, a person in charge is especially thankless, isn't it better to comfortably use their privileges to seek great profits? This is the objective reason for not wanting to serve the people.</p>
<p>How to Improve People's Livelihood</p>
<p>To improve today's people's livelihood, within the reach of my humble views, there are the following points:</p>
<p>Strengthen Control Institutions — To strengthen control institutions, we must make their organization simple and their responsibilities clear. For example, recently the person in charge of the Rice Control Association made a statement, explaining that the responsibility for distribution lies with the Grain Allocation Committee, the responsibility for transportation lies with the Central China Rice Allocation Association, and the Rice Control Association is responsible for purchasing. Now, just taking rice as an example, there are three organs, so the slowness and high cost of today's distribution are due to the organization being too complex. Because the organization is too complex, when the two institutions lose contact with each other, the entire control work is completely paralyzed. There is another drawback, which is unclear responsibility and mutual evasion. Therefore, we hope that the highest control organ in the country will, as soon as possible, make the organization of its subordinate institutions as simple as possible, merging as much as possible what can be merged, and trying to abolish what can be abolished, and then clearly specify each responsibility with a clear order.</p>
<p>Improve the Implementation of Distribution — To improve the implementation of distribution, the only principle is to not waste a single bit of material, and at the same time be able to maintain the minimum needs of consumers. Therefore, there are now two requirements: First, be punctual and sufficient, just like when the concessions were not yet recovered. If it is absolutely necessary to be unable to be punctual or to change the quality and reduce the quantity, please have the person in charge announce to the people the reason why. Second, use materials appropriately. Today, our citizens are saving to the point where they are not living a "human" life. The materials saved are supplied to special classes to enjoy, such as gasoline, coal, electricity, sugar, etc. Because of the relationship of control, the machines that use gasoline have stopped, and the gasoline saved is used in the cars at the entrance of the dance halls. The factories that use coal and electricity have reduced the number of working days, but the theaters and dance halls are still using coal to light the stoves, and the electric lights are shining until dawn. The sugar coating for medicine is gone, but the sugar in the cafes is still for you to use freely.</p>
<p>Open Distribution Actions — We hope that when a period of distribution is announced, the materials being distributed, the prices at which they were bought, the locations where they were bought, the dates when they were bought, the transportation costs, the personnel costs, and the field fees, etc., along with the total distribution volume of the city, will be announced together. This can avoid the exploitation of middlemen and allow producers and consumers to both benefit.</p>
<p>Personnel Need to Be Honest — We hope that the people in charge will think about the people everywhere. No matter if their positions are different or their opinions are different, we, the people, are innocent. We hope that the people in charge will "do what they cannot bear" with a "heart that cannot bear others' suffering," so that our own compatriots will not be hungry or cold. If there is this kind of spirit, then no matter how bad the objective environment is, with this spirit, we can always eliminate them one by one. If many people in charge want to keep themselves clean and love themselves, it is no different from "asking a tiger for its skin." In the desperate pursuit of a negative strategy, we hope that the judicial authorities, in order to maintain the law and protect the interests of the people, will establish a severe temporary law for those who are traitors to the people and those who ruin the country, even using the death penalty is not too much. At the same time, the authorities should absolutely not harbor any favoritism, and slightly act falsely, although there are many who manipulate coins and are quite thorny to deal with, but they cannot "follow the law" because of different people.</p>
<p>We Hope for Allied Assistance — We hope that the Allied authorities will, in their consistent spirit of benevolence, do their best to help, so that they can get reasonable people's livelihood as soon as possible. The good fortune of the Chinese people's livelihood is also the good fortune of the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>The People Themselves Should Take Responsibility Now, the failure of control, we, the people, are not without fault. The attitude of "only hearing about the world with two ears" is not right. Because it is we ourselves who are starving to death, and it is we ourselves who are freezing to death. We must step up our assistance to the control work, so that people's livelihood can be resolved as soon as possible. At the same time, for the organs that oppress the people, we must also do our best to expose the situation of their malfeasance and behind-the-scenes. We want to save ourselves, or we have to save ourselves.</p>
<p>Finally, What We Expect from the National Government — Before the completion of full peace today, when the hearts of the people have not fully returned, practicing "benevolent governance" is the only way. "If the people are not hungry or cold, and yet there is no one who becomes king, there has never been such a case." The so-called "grief and resentment are greater than poverty." The people who are grieving and resentful, what great theories and ideals, they do not listen to them.</p>
<h3 id="e53">How to Promote Increased Grain Production <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>"The people regard food as their heaven," an ancient saying in our country, sufficiently demonstrates the importance of grain. Examining historical records, almost all rebellions throughout dynasties were related to grain. During wartime, grain is also a crucial factor in determining victory or defeat. The previous world war has already given us a significant lesson. Therefore, grain is essential for daily life, indispensable for everyone, and consistently needed by both soldiers and civilians. Otherwise, it will not only affect social security but also be a key to military success or failure. Thus, the grain issue during wartime should be noted by all parties.</p>
<p>Under the wartime system, increasing production is the sole element of the wartime economy. In modern warfare, it is a war of materials. We must engage in both warfare and construction to supply military needs and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, increasing production during wartime is undeniable, and among them, increasing grain production is the most important and truly an urgent matter. Now, I will discuss the major aspects of promoting increased grain production below:</p>
<p>Security Issues</p>
<p>Since the founding of the Republic of China, internal turmoil and external invasions have been incessant, leading to rural bankruptcy. On one hand, it is due to the economic aggression of foreign powers; on the other hand, it is due to the destruction of remnant feudal labor. As a result, farmers suffer from the inability to settle in their professions and unstable living conditions. Naturally, they cannot devote their full efforts to cultivation, how can production be increased? Therefore, rural peace and political stability are essential for farmers to live and work in peace. Only then can we talk about restoring normal production, and only then can we talk about increasing production. Therefore, political clarity and farmers living and working in peace are the prerequisites for increased grain production.</p>
<p>Reclamation Issues</p>
<p>Our cultivated land accounts for only 15% of the total area, while wasteland reaches over 1.4 billion mu. Currently, due to the war, even more land is abandoned. To ensure that every inch of land can maximize its effectiveness for the sake of increasing grain production, the government authorities should order landlords to resume cultivation within a certain period. If the deadline is not met, the government should send people to cultivate or cultivate on behalf of others, without collecting land rent. In this way, the cultivated land will increase, and production can gradually rise. In addition, unnecessary places should be converted into farms for cultivation and reduce the production of tobacco.</p>
<p>Machinery Issues</p>
<p>Our country has always used manual labor for farming. If machinery is used instead, production will increase at least several times. In peacetime, the replacement of farm laborers by machinery may increase rural unemployment. However, currently in wartime, labor is lacking, and productivity urgently needs to be increased. It is right to promote mechanical cultivation. It can not only save labor but also promote increased production. In recent years, the massive production of agricultural products in the Soviet Union has benefited from the use of agricultural machinery. Because large-scale state-owned farms and collective farms have been widely established throughout the country, agricultural mechanization is achieved, and the productivity of labor is increased scientifically. This is worth emulating.</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Issues</p>
<p>Water conservancy work can be divided into two types: dry land and water land. If both aspects of water conservancy are improved considerably, production can be increased. The palliative method is to build dikes and dredge river channels to facilitate drainage and use machines to pump water to facilitate irrigation. The fundamental method is to plant more forests to prevent floods; it can also harmonize the climate so that rainfall is not lacking, and droughts can be reduced. Addressing both the symptoms and the root causes is essential to promote increased production.</p>
<p>Agricultural Tool Issues</p>
<p>Our country's farmers are exceptionally poor, coupled with rural bankruptcy, they are even more unable to buy new-style farming tools, still using the outdated farm tools of thousands of years, how can production be increased? Therefore, the competent authorities should purchase new-style simple agricultural tools, such as water pumps, seeders, mowing machines, rice milling machines, and insecticide sprayers, insecticide powder sprayers, etc., and set up tool stations in appropriate locations, specifically for renting to local farmers for joint use, and send personnel to provide guidance. At the same time, adapt improved agricultural tools to local conditions. For cattle used for plowing, make every effort to avoid killing them and protect them, and find ways to increase cattle production.</p>
<p>Seed Issues</p>
<p>According to expert research, if improved seeds are used, not only can the quality of the products be increased, but also the quality of the products can be improved. For example, using improved seeds of rice can increase production by more than 5%, and wheat can increase by more than 30%. Therefore, the competent authorities should use scientific methods to collect the best seeds from all over the country, establish large-scale breeding farms for propagation, lend them to farmers separately, and actively promote them. In 1925, Italy vigorously implemented the wheat movement, the purpose of which was to encourage cultivation of improved varieties using scientific methods to promote increased production.</p>
<p>Fertilizer Issues</p>
<p>The fertilizers traditionally used in our country are human and animal manure, as well as decayed plants. Today, the prices of these fertilizers are expensive, and it is even impossible to buy them. The lack of fertilizer makes production inadequate. In fact, our country has raw materials for fertilizer everywhere. It is urgent for government agencies to use scientific methods to set up factories to manufacture chemical fertilizers themselves and lend them to farmers in large quantities at low prices to supplement the lack of artificial fertilizers. In fact, the use of chemical fertilizers can increase production by up to 15% or about 55%. From this, we can know that chemical fertilizers have a close relationship with increased grain production.</p>
<p>Pest Issues</p>
<p>Our country's farmers do not understand scientific methods and lack scientific equipment, resulting in a considerable amount of losses from insects, caterpillars, and other pests. Then, the government authorities should emulate the methods of the United States, spending huge sums of money every year to establish agencies like the Bureau of Entomology, intensify the research on extermination and mitigation methods: at the same time, for insecticides, pest control equipment, arsenic lime, arsenic calcium powder and other insecticidal materials, should be manufactured in large quantities and supplied to farmers at low prices. In addition, for unfilled grains and weeds (which absorb fertilizer in the fields and hinder the growth of rice), they should be eradicated using scientific methods, and the harvest will be abundant in the future.</p>
<p>Soil Issues</p>
<p>Soil is one of the three major elements of grain production. It can solidify the roots of crops, nourish the growth of crops, and extend to the survival, prosperity, and yield quality of crops, all of which depend on the nature of the soil. Therefore, the analysis and improvement of soil is an urgent task today.</p>
<p>All of the above are indispensable for increasing grain production and should be actively promoted and implemented, especially the improvement of rural politics, the stability of order, enabling farmers to live and work in peace, coupled with scientific methods, the improvement of production technology, and the adjustment of rural finance, then grain production will inevitably increase?</p>
<h3 id="e54">The Road to Rural Construction in China <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Li Zhongmou</p>
<p>Today, among the most important issues concerning people's livelihoods, none is more critical than the crisis in the rural economy. China is a country based on agriculture, with 80% of the population directly engaged in agriculture, and the remaining 20% indirectly relying on agricultural products. Once the rural economy falters, the collapse of the entire national economy is inevitable. The focus of this article is to discuss the relationship between rural construction and people's livelihoods in order to find the most practical and effective way to improve rural areas, thereby seeking a reasonable solution to the national livelihood problem.</p>
<p>Agricultural Aspects</p>
<p>(Land) The development of agriculture is almost entirely built on land. The relationship between land and agriculture is like that between industry and factories, inseparable for even a moment. The impact of China's land problems on agriculture lies not in the amount of land, but in the lack of equal distribution and full utilization. In other words, it means developing wasteland and expanding cultivated land.</p>
<p>A. Measurement Due to the inconsistency of weights and measures throughout the country, the measurement methods vary from place to place. In land statistics, it is extremely difficult to obtain accurate figures. How much cultivated land and how much wasteland China actually has will not be known until a unified measurement is made.</p>
<p>B. Registration After thorough measurement, registration should be carried out in accordance with the facts. Only then can land consolidation plans be carried out.</p>
<p>C. Consolidation The surveyed land can be distributed from densely populated areas to achieve an average state. Then, each can engage in agricultural work in their own position. For example, dry land is planted with wheat, paddy fields are planted with rice, and mountainous areas are planted with forests…, so that the land can be utilized as much as possible.</p>
<p>(Labor and Capital) Agriculture needs land, but also a large amount of labor and sufficient capital to promote it. Land is dead, but with labor and capital, there can be active production. In weak and poor China, there are many matters for labor and capital improvement. However, the most important thing is to start with tenant farmers and financial institutions.</p>
<p>A. Tenant Farmers In our country, only 40% of farmers are owner-cultivators. The rest are mostly tenant farmers and semi-owner-cultivators. This semi-owner-cultivator and tenant farmer system is very unfavorable to agricultural management compared to owner-cultivators. The government should formulate tenant farmer regulations to eliminate disputes between landlords and tenants.</p>
<p>B. Capital The state should establish agricultural lending institutions to lend money to farmers on a credit basis. Because most farmers lack capital, and there are no good financial institutions in the local area to borrow from. This makes farmers unable to do what they want. Once this type of institution is established, farmers can enjoy long-term low-interest loans and work hard to cultivate the land. And gradually, they may have the opportunity to acquire land and become owner-cultivators.</p>
<p>(Technology) From a historical perspective, although Chinese agriculture has evolved over a considerable period, farmers stick to outdated methods and do not know how to improve. So far, there has been no significant progress. The yield of agricultural products is both low and of poor quality. Unless agricultural technology is reformed, there will be no new expectations.</p>
<p>A. Agricultural Tools As the old saying goes, "A craftsman must sharpen his tools if he wants to do his job well." The material civilization of the 20th century lies in how to use machines to replace human labor; and to seek upward work efficiency. In addition to the clumsy tools left by their ancestors, few people in China use modern and sophisticated machines for agricultural work. Selecting and manufacturing new agricultural tools is indispensable.</p>
<p>B. Varieties Improvement of seeds has long attracted the attention of the world. However, Chinese farmers have always been indifferent to these. They believe that the quality of the harvest is determined by heaven rather than man. In order to save money, they deliberately use inferior seeds. No wonder the quality of crops is gradually becoming rough. But for the sake of revitalizing agriculture, the improvement of seeds is essential.</p>
<p>C. Fertilizer Manure is a unique and good method in Chinese agriculture. But it is inevitable that farmers have to suffer from smelling the stench every day. If a cleaner fertilizer powder can be researched, it would at least be much more convenient when fertilizing.</p>
<p>D. Seedlings After the fertilizer varieties have been selected and planted, the cultivation and protection of the seedlings are also very beneficial to agriculture.</p>
<p>(Management) In the past, agriculture in our country has been accustomed to simple management and has been constrained by the self-sufficient economic principle, which has little to do with the outside world. Now that trade between China and foreign countries is convenient. Those engaged in agriculture should have a new trend; in order to develop their business. That is, they should conduct reasonable and legal operations in accordance with the principles of exchange economics and the theory of agricultural economics.</p>
<p>A. Experiment In the past, promoting agricultural improvement often focused on one aspect. Such as sericulture improvement, mulberry improvement, or fruit tree cultivation improvement. Observing and experimenting separately lead to the disadvantages of decentralized progress. To remedy this drawback, it is necessary to seek a farm business for comprehensive improvement as soon as possible. It is necessary to make them mutually related in order to achieve the effectiveness of the experiment.</p>
<p>B. Promotion Organize agricultural product exhibition conferences on a regular basis. Regardless of whether the management methods of various rural areas have been improved or not, methods should be found to connect them. In order to strengthen strength and facilitate observation. And there are designated special funds for the expenditure of bonuses, subsidies, and experimental area expenses.</p>
<p>(Organization) In the past, Chinese agricultural organization was like a plate of loose sand, not knowing how to help each other, not knowing how to unite. In the future, cooperation should be the center, and seek multiple benefits of credit production and consumption.</p>
<p>A. Cooperation The cooperative business is a must for agricultural organizations. The improvement of agriculture is due to the mutual harmonization of the interests of the majority, not the mutual conflict of the interests of the majority. The promotion and establishment of cooperative businesses can be weighed according to the environment, guided to proceed, and methods can be found to operate concurrently.</p>
<p>B. Encouragement of Industry The encouragement of industry is not only to increase the production of agriculture itself, but also to strengthen other side businesses. Under strict organization, the existing agriculture is developed, and the new agriculture is popularized.</p>
<p>Agricultural Product Aspects</p>
<p>(Quality) The value of agricultural products depends on their quality. There is no doubt that everyone expects the higher the better of this price earned by the blood and sweat of farmers. Otherwise, the poor quality of agriculture is a great loss.</p>
<p>A. Standard The quality of agricultural products, what kind of quality is the most ideal and most excellent, should be set to an appropriate standard. As the basis for researching agricultural products.</p>
<p>B. Grade After setting the standard, grade various crops according to their quality. To make agricultural products easier to improve and improve.</p>
<p>(Storage) China has long neglected the proper storage of agricultural products. As a result, harvested crops are often damaged and deteriorated due to poor storage. In this way, the production of agricultural products will naturally be reduced.</p>
<p>A. Warehouse In order to store the harvested crops in the warehouse, the structure and equipment of this warehouse must be perfect. Precautions, such as ventilation, moisture prevention..., are all necessary.</p>
<p>B. Fire Protection In order to prevent the loss of stored agricultural products, fire protection facilities must be prepared at all times to protect the safety of crop storage.</p>
<p>C. Insurance This point is also as important as fire protection work for storing agricultural products, just in case.</p>
<p>(Transportation) Transportation in China is inconvenient, and the circulation and transportation of agricultural products are extremely difficult. Crops in the south cannot be exchanged with crops in the north. This causes an uneven phenomenon of surplus or shortage. The unsmooth distribution of agricultural products has become the biggest problem at present.</p>
<p>A. Transportation Developing railways and building highways will enable close connections throughout the country's transportation, and agricultural products will be exchanged in various places.</p>
<p>B. Water Conservancy Our country's rivers have been dredged for years. The accumulation of silt not only loses the benefits of water transportation, but also brews the remnants of floods and disasters. Building dikes, afforestation, dredging tributaries, and regulating water volume are all urgent tasks.</p>
<p>C. Distribution In order to achieve the purpose of agricultural product transportation, after the transportation is convenient, the distribution problem must also be taken into account. That is, select agricultural products from various places and distribute them to the whole country according to the principle of whether they have anything in common.</p>
<p>(Sales) After agricultural products are transported to a certain destination, the next step is sales. The price and market at the time of sale must be calculated. This is the exchange of materials for money, and then the use of money to generate materials.</p>
<p>A. Price The stability of prices is extremely important for agricultural products. In the past, China once kept the prices of agricultural products very low. This of course exhausted the capital of farmers. Now, due to the war and the lack of materials, agricultural product prices are soaring day by day. Similarly, it is not a good phenomenon. Stabilizing prices is a necessary step in agricultural production.</p>
<p>B. Market The place where agricultural products are bought and sold is the market. However, after being heavily exploited by ordinary merchants, the actual income is very low even if it is sold at a very high price. In order to avoid this accident, it is necessary to organize a public agricultural product market.</p>
<p>Farmer Aspects</p>
<p>(Burden) It can be said that the burden of Chinese farmers is heavier than that of any other occupation. In terms of taxation, there are land taxes, forced loans, deed taxes, agricultural product taxes, and other special taxes. With such a heavy financial burden, they also have to provide labor service on their bodies, and even make sacrifices of life. These are the obligations that Chinese farmers have fulfilled to the country. In order to reduce their burden, the following measures should be taken.</p>
<p>A. Taxes In addition to paying grain taxes and land taxes, farmers should try their best to reduce other unreasonable taxes and fees.</p>
<p>B. Service Service is the duty that the people should fulfill to the country, but generally, local tyrants and evil gentry, corrupt officials and warlords often deceive ignorant old farmers. They force hard-working farmers to conscript strong young men, which is absolutely eliminated.</p>
<p>(Education) Farmers have shallow knowledge and a low level of culture, which hinders the progress of new agriculture and the prosperity of new rural areas. These are all due to the impact of the lack of education in the past. Popularizing farmer education is the foundation for all agricultural progress.</p>
<p>A. Thought Understand their own responsibilities and the concept of the country. Arouse the patriotism of farmers and sweep away the past erroneous thoughts of not asking about national affairs and only caring about food and clothing. Farmers across the country unite and become autonomous.</p>
<p>B. Science The scientific civilization of the 20th century should be deeply transmitted to farmers. Use scientific methods to seek agricultural improvement.</p>
<p>C. Customs In recent years, the level of living has been rising, and the world is gradually becoming more extravagant. But no matter what, farmers should preserve their inherent frugal habits.</p>
<p>D. Literacy There are too many illiterate farmers, and the literacy movement should be fully launched as soon as possible. At least have the ability to read newspapers and magazines.</p>
<p>(Security) To ensure the stability of farmers' lives, security must first be ensured. If security is not stabilized for a day, farmers' lives will not be peaceful for a day. As a result of the war in recent years, after the war, the work of cleaning up the countryside is necessary.</p>
<p>A. Cleaning up the Countryside The Baojia system should be vigorously implemented, and the population survey must be carried out in a practical manner. So that bandits cannot succeed.</p>
<p>B. Militia Farmers are fully armed to defend their homeland. Everyone has the responsibility of guarding, forming a self-defense army and cooperating with the government troops.</p>
<p>(Hygiene) The health of life is equally important to rural residents and urban residents. Farmers, from the point of view of their natural environment and occupational nature, occupy a superior position in terms of hygiene. However, due to economic and material constraints, it is far less than that of urban residents. Therefore, we should find ways to increase it.</p>
<p>A. Entertainment Proper entertainment can recuperate farmers' exhausted bodies and minds. For example, the establishment of farmers' public clubs, parties, theaters, concerts...and other entertainment venues.</p>
<p>B. Physical Education Use the leisure time of farming to exercise and increase physical strength. Natural grasslands and pools can be used to practice ball games or swimming.</p>
<p>(Disasters) Prevent all waterlogging, drought, wind, and pest disasters.</p>
<p>In short, China is still an agricultural country today. The construction of politics, economy, and society should take rural development as a major prerequisite. Building rural China is finding a new way for the entire nation to survive.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Grain Control and Production Issues <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Yingbiao</p>
<p>1.  The Importance of Wartime Grain Issues</p>
<p>Modern warfare is total, long-term warfare. The victory or defeat of a nation depends not only on its military advantages, but also significantly on its domestic resources and overall economic potential. Consequently, economic offensives and naval blockades are regarded by various governments as strategies to defeat the enemy, and this kind of strategy of stabbing the enemy in the back is no less effective than a blitzkrieg! Therefore, in order to balance domestic labor, replenish military supplies, strengthen material combat, and fully utilize all domestic materials without waste, it is necessary to adopt a controlled economy. The issue of grain control is the most important livelihood item in a controlled economy. If the grain issue can be properly controlled, then final victory can be assured. After the outbreak of the last European war, although Germany had achieved absolute military victory, its people had suffered from hunger since 1916. Turnips and beets were requisitioned by the government as military rations, and wheat and corn were nowhere to be found. As a result, despite two more years of fighting, Germany was ultimately subdued by the Allied Powers due to the collapse of its food supply. From this, we can see the importance of the grain issue in a protracted war. In this war for the survival of the East Asian nations, it is necessary to repeatedly review the grain issue, which is crucial for people's livelihoods and urgently needed for military supplies.</p>
<p>2.  China's Grain Issue After Entering the War</p>
<p>Although China is an agricultural country, due to the lack of improvement in agricultural technology and systems, production is lagging behind. As a result, domestic production is often insufficient to meet the needs of the people. Before the war, it was still possible to rely on foreign supplies, but since the Greater East Asia War, not only has maritime transport become difficult, but a large amount of military supplies must also be provided, causing a major blow to China's grain administration. Therefore, the current state of China's grain issue is a combination of three difficulties: insufficient production, inadequate consumption, and uneven distribution. However, if the government can work hard to increase grain production on the one hand, and implement flexible control policies on the other, then self-sufficiency in grain will not be an ideal impossibility. However, for two years, the government has not had a sound policy on this important issue, which is truly regrettable. The following is a brief description of the management and drawbacks of China's grain administration:</p>
<p>(A) Control Organizations and Personnel In September of the 32nd year of the Republic [1943], after the dissolution of the Rice and Grain Joint Operations Agency, the Rice and Grain Control Committee was established. The Rice Control Committee is the highest authority for grain control, and its major responsibilities are sufficient to influence the future of China's economic control. Therefore, its key personnel are all appointed by the government from among public figures with a strong reputation in society. However, although the upper-level organization is well-structured, the lower-level organization is inevitably of mixed quality, resulting in a separation between the upper and lower levels, corruption, leakage, and manipulation. As a result, rice and grain control has failed to achieve a satisfactory state, and the black market price of rice has become increasingly rampant. Therefore, in order to ensure the smooth and rational progress of grain administration, the personnel of all organizations must be adjusted.</p>
<p>(B) Procurement, Requisition, and Transportation In the past, the procurement and requisition of grain were mostly carried out by the control authorities and grain merchants in various producing areas signing procurement contracts, and then the local grain merchants would go to the countryside to purchase. This procurement policy often granted grain merchants various privileges in order to enable them to carry out their purchasing work smoothly. However, when purchasing, grain merchants sought exorbitant profits, so they often lowered the statutory price set by the government, in addition to their due profits, or intimidated farmers under false pretenses, or forced them to sell all their grain. At the same time, if farmers wanted to sell all or the surplus grain they had to the purchasing merchants, the purchase price was too low, and the price of their half-year's hard work was only enough to pay for grain and taxes. As a result, most farmers were resentful, misunderstood the government's original intention of controlling purchases, and refused to sell. Therefore, the failure of procurement and requisition to proceed flexibly was also based on the imperfection of this procurement policy. Secondly, there is the transportation issue. The Rice Control Authority must have a unified plan for the transportation of rice and grain in advance, in order to ensure that the allocation of rice and grain can be carried out on time without error. However, recently, the Rice Control Authority often blamed transportation inconvenience for the delay in allocation, while the black market rice of porters and footmen, even in remote rural areas, can still continuously supply the people's food. It is hoped that the authorities in charge will thoroughly eliminate this problem of inadequate supply due to the inability to transport smoothly.</p>
<p>(C) Allocation Quantity and Rice Quality At the beginning of the establishment of the Rice Control Committee, it forcefully stated that in view of the failure of past rice and grain control allocation, it would do its best to innovate in the future. However, it has been four months since its establishment, and although there have been rumors of increasing the allocation quantity to two and a half sheng, this has not yet been realized, causing great suffering to the common people. It is still remembered that the initial household rice allocation was once every seven days, with two sheng of white rice and two jin of flour per period. Later, it gradually decreased. After the Rice Control Committee took over, it became once every ten or twelve days, so one period of rice allocation was only enough for two days of cooking, and the remaining eight days of rice had to be obtained from the black market. Moreover, the recent household rice allocation is often not on time. Only eight sheng have been allocated in the past four months. If the black market is cracked down on, the people will only be able to wait for death. Therefore, if the Rice Control Committee cannot control the procurement and allocate a sufficient quantity, and wants to eliminate the black market and crack down on smuggling, it will only delay and harm the people's livelihood. If the Rice Control Committee can increase the allocation quantity so that the people's needs meet the allocation quantity, then the high-priced black market rice can be eliminated without prohibition, and the allocation of grain can also be on the road to success. As for the quality of rice, in the past, the quality of rice allocated in the same period was often not uniform. It was either broken rice, or red rice, or brown rice, etc. This kind of non-uniform rice quality is very easy to give allocation merchants the opportunity to play tricks, receiving bad rice and selling brown rice. In short, they steal from the sky and change the day, letting them do as they please, causing the people to suffer great losses invisibly. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the allocation quantity and rice quality.</p>
<p>(D) Grain Production In recent years, the people of China have been threatened by grain panic, so the issue of grain production has gradually become an urgent matter. The government has also been vigorously promoting it, such as the National Economic Construction Movement launched before the Incident [the Marco Polo Bridge Incident]. However, over the years, China's rural areas have been devastated by natural and man-made disasters, so the rural economy has been exhausted. In addition, because rural funds have been absorbed and concentrated in cities, farmers' debts have increased. As a result, most farmers have abandoned their fields and moved from rural areas to cities to make a living. Due to this trend, the area of barren land has increased, land has been concentrated in the hands of landlords and wealthy people, and production yields have gradually decreased. At the same time, the urban areas have also formed a shortage of grain due to the sharp increase in population, so food imports have increased. These several consecutive causes and effects have constituted the foundation of China's grain panic. Therefore, those who study grain production today must fundamentally reform China's rural areas. For example, the Food Production Promotion Conference held on September 15, and the transfer of the Central Agricultural Implement Factory to the Ministry of Construction, and the recent convening of the Cooperative Society Conference on December 18, all fully demonstrate the government's determination to increase grain production highly. Therefore, if this huge and concrete plan can be carried out in an orderly manner, then the current urgent grain issue can also be solved as a result, and the country's century-old plan will also rely on the success or failure of this move.</p>
<p>3.  Future Improvement Directions for the Grain Issue</p>
<p>(A) Control Organization and Personnel Aspect Grain control is an extremely difficult task, especially in the area of personnel. Therefore, in order to eliminate corruption among staff, it is necessary to strictly supervise, clearly distinguish rewards and punishments, and formulate reward and punishment regulations for grain administration personnel, so that the honest can be rewarded and the corrupt can be warned. At the same time, it is hoped that the Rice Control Committee authorities will set up a tip box so that people in society can report any misconduct they see at any time. The current senior personnel of the Rice Control Committee are mostly famous people in the city, but they are inevitably unfamiliar with other places. Therefore, it is hoped that more grain merchants or celebrities from other places can be invited to participate, so that the activities of the control organization can become more widespread. At the same time, hire economists to study a rational allocation system. Although grain administration personnel must be clean and self-disciplined, if their monthly salary is not enough to support their livelihoods, then no matter how strict the law enforcement is, they will still inevitably neglect their duties and become corrupt. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can increase the treatment of grain administration personnel in the future.</p>
<p>(B) Procurement, Collection and Transportation Aspect Abolish the previous method of merchants contracting for the collection of rice and grain, and set up offices in each district, with the district magistrate responsible for supervision. When collecting, take the village as a supply unit, and the office must first investigate its cultivated area, population density, and the number of dan of rice and grain collected this year; then, according to the size of its population and the size of the cultivated area, determine the amount of reserves for the village, so that farmers can maintain their self-use food and seeds for the coming year, and then deduct the reserves and special rice from the actual collection amount, and this final amount is the amount that the government can truly collect. The so-called special rice is the rice that farmers store properly for disposal in the event of famine or poor harvest. The price at the time of purchase must add considerable benefits in addition to the farmer's costs, so that there is no bias and the farmer can automatically supply and happily transport the grain. The so-called farmer's costs are land rent, fertilizer, seeds, labor, and annual living expenses, etc. Management and transportation are also a major issue in grain control. If the procurement work can be carried out smoothly, but the transportation cannot be smooth, then the phenomenon of surplus grain in area A and insufficient grain in area B may reappear. Therefore, before the grain is purchased, the authorities must communicate with various transportation agencies to ensure that the transportation of rice and grain enjoys various priority rights, and order each office to be responsible for preventing leakage and shortage during transportation.</p>
<p>(C) Allocation Quantity and Rice Quality Aspect The minimum allocation of rice and grain must maintain the principle of the resident's proper consumption, so that the high-priced black market rice disappears from the market, which can indirectly affect the prices of all commodities, and the people's livelihood can be stabilized as a result. The distribution period of allocated rice should be absolutely accurate and on time, so that residents can trust the control authorities and reduce the amount of purchases from the black market. The quality of rice should also be uniform. If it cannot be completely uniform, the distributor who receives the rice should be given a special announcement, which indicates what kind of rice is sold in that place, so that the rice merchant's swapping tricks can be eliminated.</p>
<p>(D) Grain Production Aspect Increasing and expanding the area of arable land and reforming small-scale operations China has a vast land area, but the area of arable land is extremely small. According to a survey by the US Department of Agriculture in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], the percentage of arable land to the total area of China is 2.1. Therefore, if the area of arable land can be expanded, agricultural products can be greatly increased. At the same time, consolidating the small-scale farms of farming families, combining them and operating them collectively, large-scale farming can be implemented, and the capital and labor of the farming families can be economically utilized, and the goal of increasing production can be gradually achieved. Improving grain and wheat varieties and promoting superior varieties The quality of varieties has a great relationship with the harvest yield of production. Often in the same environment, the yield of superior varieties is more than other varieties. Therefore, in order to increase the yield, improving and promoting superior varieties of grain and wheat is also an important policy. Supplementing and strengthening farming cattle and universally promoting the application of new agricultural implements In recent years, the number of farming cattle in China has generally decreased. The reason for this is that the rural areas are exhausted, the economic power of the farming families is low, and the farming cattle are sold off. However, farming cattle are an indispensable agricultural output in China. Therefore, supplementing farming cattle is an important issue in the economy of farming families. Land and agricultural implements are both necessary for farmers, but China has more small-scale operations, and large-scale machinery is not needed. Therefore, the application of new and improved agricultural implements doubles the result with half the effort and improves production efficiency, which must be promoted. Consolidation of Water Conservancy The occurrence of water damage is also a major reason for the decline of China's agriculture. The great flood of 1931 affected the loss of morning products to the amount of 457 million yuan, so in this voice of increasing grain production, consolidating water conservancy is also an urgent task. Organization of Cooperative Farming In the plan for rural reconstruction, cooperative undertakings are actually the function of promoting farmers' organizations, so that farming families can get out of the exploitation of intermediate merchants and the heavy siege of high-interest loans, creating agricultural cooperative organizations, so that production products can be jointly transported and sold, and consumer goods can be jointly purchased. Therefore, cooperative undertakings can be said to be absolutely necessary in the countryside. Developing Urban and Rural Areas Garden cities were originally promoted by Britain. The original intention of the promotion was to "remedy the malpractices in Britain." In fact, this move not only changed the urban life with many malpractices into a fresh rural life, but also had a considerable relationship with reclaiming wasteland and promoting production.</p>
<p>4.  Conclusion</p>
<p>The above is only the current situation of the grain issue and the direction of its improvement. However, the grain issue has a close relationship with the national economy, and the human and material resources required to promote it are also unlimited. The government should do its best to take charge of promoting the strength, and especially rely on the national people's sincere cooperation on this important issue. As the editorial of Shen Bao said: "Controlled economy is still a new undertaking in our country. Whether the future development is smooth or not is entirely tied to the people's understanding and cooperation. To obtain the people's understanding and cooperation, it is necessary to first establish the credibility of the controlled economy. Rice and grain control is the main livelihood item in the controlled economy, and it is especially necessary to establish credibility." Then the government and the control organization must earnestly assume responsibility, and the people must save consumption and vigorously carry out production. If both of these aspects are taken into account and planned, then the nation and the people's livelihood can also achieve the desire for equality and liberation.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Suggestions for Improving Housing Leases <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Aifang</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th" Incident, residents from all over have suffered from the scourge of war and have flocked to Shanghai, resulting in a situation where the supply of houses in Shanghai cannot meet the demand. In general, those who take the opportunity to make money suddenly become blinded by greed and attempt to obtain illegal benefits. The so-called transfer fees, small rents, and digging fees have emerged. Whenever a house is rented by the owner (i.e., the landlord) to the tenant (i.e., the second landlord) or subleased by the tenant to the first subtenant, and even to the second or third subtenant (i.e., the third tenant), they are all free to collect huge transfer fees or small rents to satisfy their illegal desires. Therefore, the trend is that the owner squeezes the tenant, and the tenant further searches the subtenant. As a result, the one who bears the most burden is the subtenant. However, in order to solve the problem of temporary residence, the latter has to accept the various harsh conditions of the tenant with pain. Cunning tenants often obtain several houses from the owner and not only can obtain huge profits from them and provide a place for their families to live, but also the rent collected from the subtenants each month, in addition to paying the owner, has a surplus sufficient to maintain the family's life. In this case, they do not seek a job and can enjoy the benefits of sitting back and reaping the rewards. If the owner has rented out the house before the war and there is no lease term, then not only is it impossible to collect the transfer fee, but also the rent collected from the tenant is not enough to pay for water, electricity, and property taxes, so he has no choice but to ask the tenant to add rent to make up for it. However, the tenant deliberately refuses to make things difficult, and even if he is willing to add some, it is still not enough to cover the above expenses. Over time, he has no choice but to use the excuse of taking it back for his own use or renovating the house to file a lawsuit in court against the tenant to move out and return the house. If there is no solid evidence, the lawsuit will be rejected by the court even after years, and the price paid for lawyer's fees and litigation fees is really not small. For a time, he is frustrated and cannot be described, and even some are burdened with debt because the lawsuit cannot recover the house or the rent is not enough to satisfy them. Over time, there is the fact of selling the house they live in separately or together. The owner's defeat in the lawsuit will undoubtedly increase the tenant's confidence in the future, and will allow him to do whatever he wants and expand his ambitions. As for the houses rented out by the owner before or after the war, if there is a fixed term, then there is no worry about the whereabouts of the transfer fee. If the tenant is unwilling to pay the amount of the transfer fee he demands, as soon as the lease term expires, he will file a lawsuit against the tenant to move out of the house in accordance with Article 450, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code: "If a lease has a fixed term, the lease relationship shall be terminated upon the expiration of the term." In this case, the court will approve the judgment in eight or nine out of ten cases, but in consideration of the difficulty of the tenant finding a house, it will give a few months of grace period for the execution period. At that time, civil lawsuits in the courts of the two special districts accounted for more than 80% of housing disputes. The court, at a time of emergency and difficulty in moving, took protecting the tenant as the principle. Among them, there were very few tenants who could understand the general situation and sympathize with the owners, and the owners who could sympathize with the tenants' difficulties were also the same. As a result, the two sides could not understand each other and were in a hostile position. Therefore, housing disputes have emerged one after another, and the seriousness of the housing problem has become more and more serious over the years. In view of this, the authorities promulgated and implemented the "Special Law on Housing Leases during Wartime" on May 10, 1943. The full text consists of 18 articles, taking into account the interests of both the lessor and the lessee, especially the lessee. The intention is to protect the center of life of the common people, so as not to have housing disputes again, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system. However, since the past six months, the number of housing lawsuits accepted by the court has suddenly decreased. Looking at the surface, the housing lease disputes seem to have gradually stabilized, but in fact, many owners know that if they rent out their houses, it will be difficult to recover them for their own use in the future, and they are unwilling to rent them out. Even if they are willing to rent them out, they all take advantage of the difficulty of finding a house and the urgency of needing a house for many tenants, and demand huge prices. All tenants with slightly better economic ability will be willing to accept it. The implementation of this special law is tantamount to creating a hoarding mentality among house owners. Therefore, although the authorities have repeatedly ordered to prohibit the collection of pre-fees and small rents, they are still rampant in secret and cannot be prevented. People who need houses cannot even ask about them. Therefore, the seriousness of the housing problem has not disappeared. The reason is that the South Bureau has not implemented thorough improvement measures. Therefore, I am not afraid to put forward humble suggestions for improvement, and I am willing to discuss with virtuous people and provide a reference for the authorities to implement. The key points for improving housing leases in the future should be carried out simultaneously from both the passive and active aspects in order to achieve practical results. The following is a separate explanation:</p>

<p>(A) From a passive point of view, one is to review whether the law itself has any obstructive clauses that need to be amended, or whether there are any loopholes that need to be explained and supplemented to remedy its poverty. The second is to focus on the practical enforcement of the law, which will be discussed separately below. According to the law, in human social life, it is a criterion based on the power of the state and has compulsory force. Looking at the legal thoughts of general countries in modern times, civil litigation takes the principle of non-interference as its principle; if the parties violate the mandatory provisions or arbitrary provisions of the Civil Code, if the dispute is not brought to the court, the issue of applying the law will not arise. However, once a fair judgment is required from the court, it cannot be achieved without using fair laws as a yardstick. Therefore, whether the law has flaws or not is also not to be ignored. The "Special Law on Housing Leases" promulgated by the authorities this time, in principle, we cannot criticize too much. However, after careful examination of the full text, there are also points that should be discussed or supplemented. The following lists the important points in detail:</p>
<h3 id="e59">Key Points of the Housing Lease Law <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>1.  Article 13 states, "When a judgment for eviction has been issued, the tenant can still retain the right to reside for a minimum grace period of two years. In special circumstances, an extension can be requested. As such, there is no termination of the lease agreement for the tenant, and they can do everything possible within two years or more to oppress the landlord or deliberately make things difficult for the landlord, to achieve their unlawful gains and live freely. Nothing is more extreme than this, and it can truly be called a major knot in housing leases. Therefore, to curb the ambitions of tenants and provide greater protection for the interests of landlords and sub-tenants, this grace period for eviction must be shortened. This fundamental regulation must be revised." We believe that this grace period for eviction should be changed to a maximum of no more than one year, and even in special circumstances, it should not be extended.</p>
<p>2.  According to Article 14, paragraph 1, "Judgments that have been determined or declared provisionally enforceable before the implementation of this law shall continue to be enforced, unless the Ministry of Judicial Administration approves a suspension of execution."  Within the grace period of the previous article, the tenant can still petition the authorities to suspend execution on the grounds of being affected by the war. If approved, the landlord would waste huge sums of money without achieving the purpose of the litigation's conclusion. The court's judgment would be equivalent to a mere formality, not only violating the principle of equal legal protection of private rights and losing credibility but also openly creating a superior position for tenants, allowing them to become even more unscrupulous and gain unlawful benefits.  As a result, anyone with vacant houses will inevitably fear renting them out, preferring to keep them empty year after year rather than lightly renting them. If this continues, the housing problem in Shanghai will remain difficult to solve. Therefore, the clause regarding "approval from the Ministry of Judicial Administration to suspend execution" must be deleted.</p>
<p>3.  Currently, the amount of general rent cannot be compared to the price of goods, and there are not a few landlords whose monthly rental income is insufficient to cover expenses such as water, electricity, donations, and taxes. According to Article 6 of this law, "If there is a need to increase or decrease the rent mentioned in the previous five articles, the parties shall negotiate to determine it. If the negotiation fails, the court shall decide."  Whether it is a fixed-term lease or an indefinite lease, the landlord can request the tenant to appropriately increase the rent at any time due to changes in circumstances. According to Article 7 of this law, the court's determination of rent should also ensure that the landlord obtains considerable profit in addition to all expenses borne for renting the house. However, this law does not explicitly state whether poor tenants can be given consideration if they cannot afford the increased rent. We believe that the court can consider their actual economic situation at this time, increasing the rent only to the extent that the landlord can cover all expenses borne. However, if the landlord's economic situation is superior, the court may not allow the rent increase to stabilize people's livelihood. This point needs to be supplemented in the legal text.</p>
<p>4.  It is worth studying whether the so-called "all expenses" in Article 7 of this law include repair costs. According to Article 429, paragraph 1, of the Civil Code, "Repairs to the leased property shall be borne by the landlord, unless otherwise stipulated in the contract or there is another custom." The determination should be based on whether there is a special agreement or local custom. However, in this extraordinary period, Article 8 of this law clearly stipulates: "Landlords or tenants shall not collect key money, transfer fees, or other similar fees from tenants or sub-tenants in addition to the security deposit, but the amount of the security deposit shall not exceed the total amount of twelve months' rent." Article 9 also clearly stipulates: "If landlords or tenants violate the provisions of the previous article, in addition to the tenant or sub-tenant being able to request the return of key money, transfer fees, or other similar fees collected after the implementation of this law according to the provisions of unjust enrichment, the court shall impose a fine of up to 30,000 yuan."  Therefore, it is difficult for landlords or tenants to obtain huge profits from renting or subletting houses, and their rental income is also limited, especially for landlords. If repair costs are not included in the "all expenses" of this article and are borne by the landlord, then the tenant and sub-tenant will not only fail to fulfill their responsibility for good management of the house and will constantly cause damage, but they may also collude with repair workers to falsely report repair costs, so that the landlord receives nothing after deducting these expenses from the rent, or even needs to provide additional compensation to the tenant. This does not adequately protect the interests of the landlord and hinders the improvement of housing leases. Therefore, we believe that repair costs should be included in the "all expenses" of this article, and for fairness, this cost should be proportionally shared according to the area of the house occupied by the tenant and sub-tenant, and considering the economic situation of each person. This should also be supplemented in the legal text to avoid disputes among the parties.</p>
<p>After the law itself is strengthened and flawless, it should be further implemented effectively to achieve its actual effect and stabilize people's livelihood. Therefore, the integrity and impartiality of judicial officials who actually execute the law at this time have a profound and significant impact on housing leases. To ensure that judges are loyal to their duties and impartial, their livelihood and status must be guaranteed. Recently, cases of judicial misconduct by judges in Shanghai courts have been frequently heard. Ethically, this should be attributed to the individual conduct of the judges, which is undeniable. In reality, judges often find that their monthly salary is insufficient to support their families, and they may be subject to suspension, dismissal, transfer, or salary reduction for even slight negligence in their duties. Therefore, the unstable livelihood and unprotected status of judges are the biggest reasons for corruption. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will promptly improve the treatment of judges, allowing them to maintain a minimum standard of living for their families, and granting them special protection in their positions. Without legal reasons, they should not be arbitrarily suspended, dismissed, transferred, or have their salaries reduced, so that the "Special Law on Housing Leases" can be effectively implemented and the housing problems of the common people can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Promoting Practical Work <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(B) From a proactive perspective, practical work on various livelihood issues related to housing leases should be carried out effectively. The key aspects are selected and analyzed below:</p>
<p>1.  Eliminate Bad Elements in Various Regions: In recent years, residents in various regions have been harassed and coerced by bandits and local thugs, leading eight or nine out of ten to be unwilling to live in their hometowns and moving to Shanghai. Even after living in Shanghai for a long time, even if their hometowns have become slightly more peaceful and habitable, they are still unwilling to return their rented houses in Shanghai and move around freely. The reason for this is undoubtedly due to the special legal protection for tenants. However, upon closer inspection, the fundamental problem is that the bad elements in various regions have not been thoroughly eliminated, causing people to fear and not dare to stay for long. Therefore, to solve the housing problem in the future, it is necessary to eliminate bad elements in various regions. The implementation of this work requires, on the one hand, deploying more security teams to various regions and equipping them with new-style weapons as much as possible. On the other hand, it is necessary to focus on the selection of responsible officials in various regions and strictly supervise them, requiring them to lead by example. If they collude with local bad elements and harm the people, they should be sentenced to death immediately after a thorough investigation to deter others. If so, the area will be peaceful, and the people will be able to live and work in peace.</p>
<p>2.  Implement Dispersal of Residents in This City: After bad elements have disappeared from various regions, it is necessary to implement the dispersal of residents from other provinces residing in this city. The implementation of this work requires, on the one hand, a detailed investigation of household registration in various districts of this city, making an accurate statistics of the residents' origin, occupation, and age. All young people or teenagers without a proper occupation should be urged to return to their hometowns, except for those needed by the city. It goes without saying that the elderly, women, and children should be dispersed. The authorities should consider the economic situation of each person and provide different preferential treatment in terms of travel expenses. After determining the number of people to be dispersed, the dispersal period should be determined. Based on the number of people and the amount of transportation, it should be divided into several phases, and the number of people and the duration of each phase should also be determined. When dispersing each phase, the municipal authorities should strictly implement it without any negligence. On the other hand, it is necessary to improve water and land transportation, such as preventing black market tickets for cars and ships, improving the treatment of transportation personnel, and ensuring the safety of water and land routes, all of which should be paid attention to in order not to hinder the implementation of the entire plan.</p>
<p>3.  Promote Agricultural and Industrial Production in Various Regions: If residents have no proper occupation to solve their livelihood after returning to their hometowns, it will not only violate the authorities' intention to implement dispersal, but also easily contribute to the resurgence of bad elements, leading to unrest in the entire region. If the good people cannot live and work in peace, they will still want to move to Shanghai, and over time, the supply and demand imbalance of housing in Shanghai will reoccur. Therefore, engaging in the promotion of agricultural and industrial production in various regions after dispersal is also closely related to solving the housing problem. The so-called promotion of agricultural and industrial production in various regions means, firstly, that agricultural and industrial loans should be organized in various regions as much as possible, reducing loan interest rates; secondly, agricultural and industrial technicians should be sent to various regions to assist and urge people to engage in production; thirdly, the development of production in various regions should be encouraged; fourthly, the lives of farmers and workers should be effectively protected; fifthly, the special rights of private landowners should be restricted; sixthly, the necessary items for various productions and consumers should be rationally distributed. If the authorities can consider the actual situation and effectively implement them one by one, then production in various regions will develop, the region will be peaceful, the lives of the common people will be stabilized, and the housing problem, which is the focus, will be suddenly solved.</p>
<p>4.  Effectively Implement the Rationing System: The authorities' original intention of implementing the rationing system was to eliminate the hoarding and speculation of unscrupulous merchants and monopolize prices to stabilize people's livelihood. However, as we see it now, although the trend of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants has been slightly curbed, the black market price of goods is still prevailing. This is due to the authorities' failure to effectively implement this system. In this time of rising prices, landlords are bound to increase rents, while tenants refuse the landlords' requests on the grounds of not being able to afford it. As a result, both parties misunderstand each other and take legal action, and disputes over housing leases will continue to emerge endlessly. Therefore, after production develops in various regions and the supply of necessities is abundant, it is still necessary to effectively implement the rationing system to solve the housing problem in the future. To effectively implement this system, firstly, the amount of rations should be increased according to the population of each household to completely eliminate the black market invisibly; secondly, the prices of various necessities should be strictly determined with reference to the current living situation. If shops do not obey orders or privately raise prices without permission, they should be immediately closed and their goods confiscated; thirdly, the treatment of rationing personnel should be improved, and if there is any case of personal gain or fraud, they should be dismissed and severely punished after verification.</p>
<p>5.  Strictly Prohibit All Unnecessary Entertainment: Although the authorities have repeatedly issued orders to prohibit opium and gambling, there are still many opium dens and gambling houses openly established in various regions. Opium and gambling not only easily corrupt the people, increase the number of bad elements in society, and hinder overall security, but also have a profound impact on the housing problem. People who operate opium and gambling are willing to pay huge key money, dig fees, and rents when renting houses. Landlords are very willing to establish a lease relationship with them in order to satisfy their desires, while ordinary people who urgently need housing for living purposes are turned away. Therefore, the failure to thoroughly prohibit opium and gambling is also a major cause of the housing problem. Therefore, to improve housing leases in the future, the authorities should make a determination to strictly prohibit opium and gambling. Firstly, all established opium dens and gambling houses should be ordered to cease operations immediately. If anyone is found to be planning to establish one, they should be severely punished without leniency. Secondly, thorough and effective measures should be implemented to persuade people to quit opium and gambling. In addition, although the harm of amusement places such as dance halls and theaters is not as deep as that of opium and gambling, excessive establishment is also closely related to the current housing problem. In order to increase the number of houses, the authorities should persuade the owners of the above-mentioned amusement places to convert them into houses for rent within the possible range, and give special rewards and guarantees to those who comply. Afterwards, if anyone applies to open one, it should be absolutely not allowed.</p>
<p>The thorough methods for improving housing leases in the future have been described above. Whether they are feasible or not, I hope that the society will generously point them out.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Re-Dispersing Shanghai's Population <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xiyao</p>
<p>On December 22nd, a Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo was published in the newspaper: "The Japanese government, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic system and disperse the urban population, decided on the outline for implementing the dispersal of the urban population at a cabinet meeting on the 21st... Although I have never been to Japan, I do not know what the situation in Japan is like today. However, judging from many texts reporting on the current situation in Japan, even taking Tokyo, the most prosperous metropolis in Japan, as an example, its population density is probably not as high as that of Shanghai today. The population of Tokyo is not extremely crowded, and the Japanese government already has plans to disperse the population. Then, can our government authorities not consider the Shanghai population problem?</p>
<p>Excessive crowding of the urban population is not a good phenomenon, whether in peacetime or in wartime. This measure by the Japanese government is prescient. The excessive number of urban population has very serious consequences.</p>
<p>Today's Shanghai population has already exceeded the saturation point. On the surface, there seems to be no major harm, but the crisis that is brewing is deepening day by day. It will be like a mountain torrent erupting and becoming uncontrollable. This is not an exaggeration. Let's analyze this crisis as follows:</p>
<p>Analysis of Urban Crisis</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai did not feel the panic of a lack of materials because of the large storage of various materials. However, after more than two years of heavy consumption, the inventory is getting thinner day by day. Today, various materials are gradually feeling exhausted. Originally, during the war, a large amount of materials needed to be used for military purposes, but the people also need to have a minimum amount of usage. However, today, which of the rice, flour, oil, and other items distributed to us by the authorities is really enough? The quantity is small, and the distribution date is far away. Really relying entirely on these, we would have died long ago. Citizens still need to buy black market supplements. There are only two sources of the black market: hoarding households releasing goods and smuggling. Once the hoarding households release everything, and smuggling is completely banned, what will the people rely on to live? Releasing goods will eventually end, and judging from the increasingly strict control of materials by the authorities, smuggling will also eventually decrease. At that time, it will be necessary to request an increase in the amount of rations, but in fact, it is absolutely impossible to distribute a quantity that is really enough. This is also not much. The authorities have already spent a great deal of effort to transport a considerable amount of materials to Shanghai for distribution, but because the population is too large, each person can only get a little bit. As the war drags on, two phenomena may occur in Shanghai: one is that the stock of various materials will be exhausted; the other is that the amount of materials transported to Shanghai by the authorities will decrease. Various serious consequences will follow.</p>
<p>Looking back at the peaceful areas in various places, although materials are also lacking, they are more abundant than in Shanghai, because the inland is an agricultural production area, and the population is small, and the consumption is low. However, why can't the authorities transport all the surplus materials from the inland to Shanghai? Because materials are scattered in various cities, towns, and counties, it is not easy to collect them, and transportation is also quite difficult.</p>
<p>Since materials are scarce, various production industries cannot obtain a large amount of raw materials, and various industries cannot maintain normal production volume. Recently, due to the coal shortage and electricity restrictions, all large and small factories will inevitably reduce their work again. As a result, on the one hand, the supply of goods on the market decreases, causing prices to rise; on the other hand, as each type of industry and commerce shrinks in scale, a group of unemployed people is added to society.</p>
<p>Shanghai was originally a place where there were more people than jobs. This situation is even more severe today. The number of unemployed people in society is increasing day by day, the competition for survival is becoming more acute, and social order is being shaken.</p>
<p>Street rice vendors are endless, and all kinds of boats and cars and single-handed peddlers are becoming increasingly rampant, which is enough to foster the black market. This has a small impact on public security. Once the way of vending is exhausted, the fierce ones will become bandits, as the saying goes, "It is better to violate the law than to starve to death."</p>
<p>Should Seek Appropriate Countermeasures</p>
<p>To resolve the above-mentioned crises, the following countermeasures should be sought: Today's industry and commerce in Shanghai are quite prosperous. Looking back at the peaceful areas, they are so poor that they can be. Many types of industries are concentrated in Shanghai. We not only ask to disperse Shanghai's population, but also hope that industry and commerce will not only develop in a distorted and partial way in Shanghai, but that the entire peaceful area will develop comprehensively. The government should actively launch various measures to revive inland industry and commerce, and should help the people move a part of industry and commerce to the inland to operate. We look forward to rebuilding magnificent factories on the barren land in the interior. Commerce originally followed industry. Due to the advancement of industry, inland commerce will naturally gradually prosper. After industry and commerce develop, many talents are needed, and people will naturally move from Shanghai, where the competition for survival is fierce, to various inland areas.</p>
<p>Schools should be established throughout the country, and the number of schools must be increased, and the quality must be improved. The inland is originally a place where the air is fresh, which is beneficial to the physical and mental health of young people. Before the war, many young people from Shanghai ran to various places to study. Once the quality of inland schools can be improved, students will naturally be happy to follow their parents back to their hometowns to study. In addition, we also ask the education authorities to order all schools that moved to Shanghai to move back to their original places to restore the schools. This will not only reduce the population of Shanghai, but also the schools in Shanghai have narrow school buildings and a poor environment. Returning to the inland to attend classes can improve teaching efficiency and is extremely beneficial to the country.</p>
<p>Various construction projects in the inland should also be actively promoted. Dredging rivers is not only beneficial to transportation, but also solves the people's water use problem. The authorities should also try to restore cities that originally had tap water facilities before the war and ensure that the supply is good. As for the power plant, it should also be rectified. If it is impossible to supply electricity during the day, at least the amount of electricity at night must be sufficient and maintain a constant supply without interruption. Other things such as road repairs, telephone installations, promotion of sanitation, and smooth public transportation should all be done practically. In short, if the living conditions in various places are good, people will naturally be happy to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Security in the peaceful areas should be strengthened, bad elements should be eradicated, and even petty thieves should not be allowed to exist. The powers of the military and police must be clear, and discipline must be strict. To make the public security in the interior good, it is necessary to strengthen the Baojia organization first. The Baojia system in the interior is not as good as that in Shanghai. The inaccuracy of household registration, the irresponsibility of the Baojia chiefs, and the loose organization must be improved everywhere. The self-alerting and value system must also be adopted. We should also train young men so that the people can actually take on the important task of maintaining the safety and security of their homeland.</p>
<p>Improving the station order should be stepped up. I hope that the authorities of the Central China Railway Company will make a determination to thoroughly improve the methods of entering and leaving the station, purchasing tickets, and checking luggage.</p>
<p>The Shanghai population is paying attention to the crisis of the population, the reasons why citizens do not return to their hometowns, and the further exploration of this problem by enthusiastic people.</p>
