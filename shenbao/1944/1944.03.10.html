<p>東京九日中央社電　十日適值日木第三十九次陸軍紀念日，回憶四十年前新興日本為自存自衛毅然奮起，對欲制霸東洋之俄國宣戰，與當時世界最大陸軍國之俄軍合師於奉天，激戰結果，終獲最後之勝利，此自全亞洲民族言之，亦改為意義深遠而難忘却之一日。際玆大東亞戰爭决勝之年，值此意義深遠之陸軍紀念日，日本一億國民減敵之鬥志將愈益旺盛，是日日陸軍省及此間之各報社，各團體均展開熱烈之紀念行事·茲誌主要之行事如次：　大政翼贊會翼贊壯年團，在鄉軍人會，日木婦人會等各支部會員，晨起淸掃英靈之墓地，並慰問出征軍人及戰　勇士家族，傷痰將兵等·　各地方分別實行修築道路，開墾荒地，收集廢品等工作，並舉行劍術大會。　此間各百貨店舉行日·緬國民交歡展覽會，陸軍軍樂隊在市內遊行，陸軍報道部長松村大佐，九日夜並作紀念廣播。</p>
<p>畑總司令發表談話</p>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日駐華派遣軍總司令官　後六大將以十日為日陸軍紀念日，茲特接見記者團發表談話，其大意如次：余於大東亞戰爭進入第三年之今日，慶祝第三十九節陸　紀念日，回憶當時余以一青年將校參加日俄之役情形，實感慨無量。日俄之役我軍於　天會戰時，擊破人數數倍於我軍之俄軍，日本海之海戰八艘，打破列國所抱之人種差別，故其意義實極重大。日俄戰以前西洋民族所抱之絕對僵　感。與東亞諸民族亳無自覺之沉渝，已因是役獲一敎訓，而崛起，中國之變　自强運動及其國父孫先生之辛亥革命即為一例。推日大自維新後三十七年發生日俄之戰，又三十七年復有今次大東亞戰之發生，大東亞戰爭其規模性格　複雜而深刻，實非日俄戰爭研可比擬。</p>
<p>戰局日趨重大</p>
<p>目前戰局日益趨於重大，其備途有非吾人所能測知者。大東亞戰爭之戰爭目的，在確立東亞永久之和平，以保全日木之光榮，吾等日木國民於此　應把握此戰爭之目的，努力完成之，回憶國民政府對英美宣戰以夾，為完威中國之獨立及解放亞洲，居與日本同生共死之立塲，努力於戰爭之完遂，此誠為余所不勝感謝者。然中國尚有一部份子為反軸心方面之宜傳所誘惑，夢想其勝利，而採取騎牆之態度，此實由於對大東亞戰爭之本質認識不足所致。蓋大東亞戰爭不能完成，則中國民族董命難有威功。　日軍自進駐中國以來，即立於第一綫，攘侵入東亞之外敵，以道義精神為依歸，謀確保東亞永久之和平，蓋大東亞戰爭唯有基於道義精神，始能繼承日俄戰爭之名分，與日木之道統。且此次戰爭亦可謂為　時代之偉大戰爭，但昨日之敵已非今日之　，今日之　實為英美，為完成大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>中日協力提携</p>
<p>大東亞各國家各民族衷心協力，誠　必要。東亞中心的中日兩民族之問，眞正協力提機，尤屬必然，此在中日同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言已有所明示，而中日協力之實績，當以日本軍官民體察大東亞戰爭之木養，身體力行為第一義，服務於本國之日人，尤應一致其決意，致力奉公，期不負盟邦數億民衆之切望，更須隊慎言行，以克服當前之難局，傾注心力戰至獲得勝利而後已。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日對華新政策　頗獲成果 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　日日駐箠大使谷正之氏此次視察中國各地，即以對華新政策為中心，圓滑疏通使各地方之特殊情形興中央結合為一體，已收莫大成果，同時關於　在各地推行新政策，漸獲預期之成果，　發揮　府之目主政治力已漸滲透各地，　新政策之推進，更為　固不動之點，　歸於物價問題及其他目前之各項問題，因屬國府實施之施策得日本關係當局一致協力，已獲解决之途，對於上述各點誠有極大之貢獻二強力推進對華施策更形明確，對新政策之重要縣案，最近必能依次解決。</p>

<p>南京九日中央社電　關於中日合辦公司之第二次調整問題，自經關係當局進行集密協議以來，大致已告决定，本次之調整工作，將以華中水產公司為始，繼此而實行調整者，尚有其餘十一家公司。至調整方針，以調整人事及資木之構成為目的，凡以往我方較諸日方之出資數量及董事人數之比例少者，將於此次調整中予以變更，俾使獲得與日方同樣之比率，或較日方為多。且此次調整之特色，由我方接管之新敵產，即將作為我方之出資而為調整資本之構成，例如華中</p>
<p>氣通訊公司之電報，電話公司，華中水電公司之上海電力公司，滬西電力公司，與華中煤業公司之電車公司等，預料均如華中水產公司之辦法，以增資質方式，作為我方之現物出資。</p>

<h3 id="c4">盟邦日本陸軍紀念日獻言 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>距今三十九年前的今天，日俄奉天會戰，日本陸軍發揮威力，從此奠定勝利基石，而肇始興國大業。因於是日定為陸軍紀念日。今天欣逢三十九屆紀念之日，不勝表示敬佩。</p>
<p>為什麽日本陸軍的英勇，堪稱世界第一呢？因為日本陸軍有傳統的武士風尚，同時，不專貴武勇，且能修文學，善詩歌，以仁愛義俠為心，謙讓而重視名譽·一旦遇敵，互以住所姓名相告，嚴正威容，爭以武術，巳決優劣，則勝者不敢辱其死者。至於狙擊暗殺，則尤為武士所恥。</p>
<p>不過，近代軍事的進步，必須與政治配合。軍事與政治，有不可分離的密切關係。關於這點，在日本陸軍中人才輩出，早有建樹。盟邦駐華派造軍前總參謀長河邊正三氏，會於前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭一周紀念日，發表「告在華將士」一文，對於在華將士之熊度，勉以　確立至嚴之軍紀；　實踐「誠」字；　尊重中國人之傳統習慣等三點。河邊氏說：「渝方仍執迷不悟，繼續抗戰，此乃因尚未信任日木之誠意故也」。這個「誠意」，就是中國數千年來，在上者對老百姓能否取得愛戴的條件，也就是政治運用的條件。因此，我們可以說，日本駐華陸軍，在軍事上可謂成功。同時，河邊氏說。。一解放中國，脫出英美之壓迫，助其完成獨立，與之永結善鄰之誼。」迁政信大佐也說：「日本經過了六年的戰爭，認識了中國，認識了世界，所以除與中國携手以外，日本不能存立……在中國的一百萬軍官民，如果每個人獲得中國的同志，能够有一萬萬中國人眞正是自己的同志，事變早已解決了。」河邊正三及　政信兩氏都是盟邦駐華派遣軍中的負責將士，他們巳經充分說明了軍事以外必須政治配合，才能使中日眞正合作。</p>
<p>至於「尊重由國人之傳統習慣」一點，尤為重要。中國對於盟邦軍紀，對於盟邦軍人的「誠意」，都已認識，可是，往往由於中日人民傳統習慣間的不同，使一切努力，受到不良影響。更因為盟邦軍人氣質與中國人民特有的耿直熊度間的隔閡，往往因小小的問題，發生極大的誤會。所以「尊重中國人的傳統習慣」，實為促使中日眞正合作很重要的因素。</p>
<p>其次，日不陸軍平素訓練的優良，更足稱道。如巳故中國著名軍事家蔣百里·黃膺白兩氏，即現在重慶主持拖戰的蔣介石，都從日本學習陸軍的。父如迁大佐說：「會與俄英美菲澳及中國軍作戰，最好的却是中國軍。」可惜重慶受英美利用，繼續拖戰，尚未促成中日全面合作。同時，誠如三品部長之言：「中國大陸今後在反軸心軍方面，視為重要的戰略目標，而顯示着大東亞戰爭最後决戰塲的性格。」我們更不能不引為莫大的不幸與遺撼。我們在此盟邦陸軍紀念之日，希望盟邦陸軍除軍事以外，普遍重視政治與軍事的密切關係，而充分發揮最足稱道的武士風尚，進而促成中日全面合作。完成大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>烟大將說：「大東亞戰爭，大東亞各國家各民族衷心協力，誠極必要。但東亞中心的中日兩民族之間，眞正協力提携，尤屬必要。」願中日兩國將士暨全體國民，共體斯旨。</p>

<h3 id="c38">迎陸軍紀念日 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 中國派遣軍報導　部長　三品中佐</p>
<p>際此空前嚴重的戰局下，又臨到第三十九屆陸軍紀念日，誠不勝感憐系之。日俄戰爭乃確保遠東和平，及日本為自在自衛而奮起的大義之戰，此在明治三十七年二月十日宣聯詔書中，有極明澈的昭示。</p>
<p>即在保術束亞聖戰的本義上，日俄戰爭與後來的滿洲事變，中國事變，大東亞戰爭是一貫的，日本為了東亞全體民族。全體國家的防衛及其繁榮，而挺身首當其難的最初的戰爭。</p>
<p>在這種條件下從事戰爭，而獲得節節勝利者，其基本原因究竟何在？雖說上託天威使然，但我們不能不深深地想到，自甲午戰爭後三國干涉交換遼東以來，歐洲列強對亞洲民族志先天的優越感與暴虐，我五千萬人民對之忍無可忍，乃臥薪嚐膽，十年準備，遂有今日的奮起。</p>
<p>日俄戰爭時的民氣</p>
<p>當時，以一遠東最爾島國日本，竟蹶起而欲制止世界最强大的大陸國家帝俄之東漸，其勢　極悲壯，而全世界對之亦不無螳臂擋車之惑。地們的人口一億七千萬，我僅五千萬；他們的平時兵力一百二十四萬，我僅十二萬；火器方面，有我方所不知道的機關槍等，使征俄戰士大感困苦。戰爭期同達二十閱月，犧性垂十萬，我國以全力而戰。當奉天會戰時，雖抓住了殲減敵人的絕好機會，但因後方補充不繼，而眼看着放逃敵人的遺憾，迄今猶流傳相談着。由此也可知道當時我國力的程度。在東北冰天雪地的一角，十數名少年為準備這雪恥的一天，乃　血為盟，團結成社。遺些少年痛感一國弱致辱」，「如意志薄弱，則不能實行」。為鍛鍊同志起見及創設早起會，從未停止，五十年來如一日，繼續迄今。當時以伊東重氏為會長的養生會就是這一種組織。依此為例，可窺當時國民意氣的一斑。</p>
<p>在當時國內外的情勢上，日俄戰爭有進展至持久戰的可能性。日木的戰爭力及國力與今日完全不同。在進行持久戰的實力上，實無把握。</p>
<p>然賴國民對國家危局之深澈的自覺，國民的準備興鍛鍊，尤以對國體之深切的感銘，在用兵作戰，國務運用的協調上，制其機宜，賴國體之靈力，乃能摧破强俄，挽回東亞危機，而完成戰爭目的，此在今日，實深銘於我們的胸中。</p>
<p>東亞的兩大民族集團</p>
<p>賴日俄戰爭的勝利，日木國力乃發展至大陸，成為東亞的新興國家，而逐漸形成北方防衛重鎭的地位。在奉天會戰中。擊破約一倍於我的俄軍，在日木海海戰中，覆演三十入艘的大艦隊；打破錯誤的人種偏見。角事實敎訓破碎了西洋民族集團之絕對的優勝感，與東洋民族自暴自棄之先天的劣敗感。日木的决心與國力，在衰亡沈渝至於極點的東洋民族集團，給與了如旭日東升一樣的光明。覺醒了潛在的亞細亞民族的民族意識，自此以後，在東方的獨立國家方面，發生了國民國家的　設運動，在被征服國家方面，誘發了民族的獨立運動。這樣看來，我們痛感到今日東亞的二大民族集團成為共同防衛的軸心，從東亞的故土擊攘共同的敵人英美，建設東亞共榮圈，即以日本為中心的東亞民族之集團國家，實已胚胎於四十年前的日俄戰爭。大東亞戰爭如今在北方及東南太平洋上，在西南亞洲大陸，及中國大陸戰綫，正突入空前劇烈的戰局。大東亞戰爭的勝敗，不獨决日本的興亡，並有關全東軍民族的與廢。戰綫的廣大，人的物的消耗之　大，戰爭規模的雄偉複雜，究非日俄戰爭可比，戰爭前途的雞關，亦非日俄戰爭司比，近代戰爭是總力戰，斷沒有前綫後方之別。今後國內後方應深切覺悟到有形無形的敵方攻擊，一億人民不能不覺悟為完遂持久戰而須有幾萬的犧牲，及老少男女陸民的總武裝之日。然而在此次戰爭中，由於緒戰中的戰果，廣大無盡藏的南方重要資源地帶。完全佔領，大陸上又有無限制的地下資源。長期戰於我愈為有利。這一點與日俄戰爭時的情熱完全不同。因此，對我「以戰養戰」的戰略態勢之確立，乃有英美的反攻，中部太平洋攻略戰。奪回緬甸的企圖，今正與日俱烈。</p>
<p>為戰爭目的盡最大努力</p>
<p>尼米資曾誇口欲橫斷太平洋，「不　空軍，並將使陸上部隊登陸中國大陸，攻擊日本本土」。中國大陸今後在反軸心軍成為重要的戰略目際，在某種意義上，顯呈着大束亞戰爭最後决戰塲的性格。現在大陸上的航空决戰日趨激化，而後方非　門員的殺傷，是敵方喜用的神經戰的手段。他們的槍鋒顯然向着無辜的民衆。現在戰爭中沒有空閑的人，實是我自身在戰着。勝負全視後方每一個國遂行戰爭的决意如何。尤其希望在業日人，深體御旨，洞澈對華新方針的信義，明以實踐之，在各自的本位上邁進。</p>
<p>長期戰，立體總力戰的情况，在大陸上亦已漸露其徽兆。在持久戰爭下的各個國民，當然應傾其一切力量，為完遂武力戰而向增强戰力邁進，同時，又應為持久戰的重大要素如政治戰，思想戰，外交戰，經濟戰等最强　的優秀戰士。武力職的一勝一敗，一進一退，為綜合運用戰力政治力途上的一個波瀾。歐洲戰綫上樊化多端的戰勢之波動，與龐大的消耗，敎訓我們的地方極多。關於作戰用兵，全體國民絕對不許懷抱不安危　。或竊竊私議。祗須在完遂戰爭目的上，傾其全能全力。在戰時下，國民各自的職位，就是戰塲。各含問守其本分，為戰爭目的而盡其最大的努力，而奮鬥至最後　間的勝利。無論遭遇任可繼關，必勝的信念與完遂職爭的决心，斷不能拋棄。</p>
<p>最後勝利是無疑的信念</p>
<p>以東方和平為理想的明治天皇的聖意，成為十萬赤子的血液，三代盛世，相繼相承，及有滿洲的建國，滿洲國現已措於磐石之安。東亞十億人民，亦翕然景從。我們有莊嚴的戰爭目的，偉大强　的戰略態勢，無窮盡的人的物的資源，與舉世無四的國體，實不勝感銘欣喜。戰爭的最後勝利，是無疑的信念。使整個人類認識日本國體的力量。</p>
<p>我派遺軍為了襲底擊滅英美，為了拯救英美欲加奴役的全中國民衆，在大陸上對英美一切勢力加以痛擊。在大陸四革萬民衆眞正獲得安居樂業之前，在全中國的建設完成之前，斷不會收轉聖戰的干戈。這實是報答我們父祖在日俄戰爭中前仆後繼，而殺身成仁之英靈的唯一路途。）翻：譯自三月九日大報新報）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Tokyo City Enthusiastically Commemorates the 39th Army Day; Reporting Department Head Matsumura Delivers Commemorative Broadcast <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The 10th marks the 39th Army Day in Japan. Recalling forty years ago, a newly rising Japan, for self-preservation and self-defense, resolutely rose up and declared war on Russia, which sought to dominate the Orient. It joined forces with the Russian army, the world's largest land army at the time, in Fengtian. After fierce battles, it finally achieved ultimate victory. From the perspective of all Asian nations, this day was also profoundly significant and unforgettable. In this decisive year of the Greater East Asia War, on this deeply significant Army Day, the fighting spirit of Japan's 100 million people to reduce the enemy will become even more vigorous. On this day, the Army Ministry and various newspapers and organizations in this city are launching enthusiastic commemorative events. The main events are recorded as follows: Members of various branches of the Taisei Yokusankai's Yokusanzōnen-dan, the Veterans Association, and the Japan Women's Association, etc., clean the graves of the war dead in the morning and offer condolences to the soldiers on the front lines, families of valiant soldiers, and wounded soldiers. Various localities will carry out road construction, wasteland reclamation, waste collection, and other work, and hold kendo tournaments. Various department stores in this city will hold a Japan-Burma Friendship Exhibition. The Army Band will parade in the city. Colonel Matsumura, head of the Army Reporting Department, will also deliver a commemorative broadcast on the night of the 9th.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Hata Issues Statement</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, General Shunroku Hata, met with a group of reporters on the occasion of the Japanese Army Day on the 10th and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: As we enter the third year of the Greater East Asia War, I commemorate the 39th Army Day. Recalling the time when I participated in the Russo-Japanese War as a young officer, I am filled with immeasurable emotion. In the Russo-Japanese War, our army defeated the Russian army, which outnumbered us several times, at the Battle of Mukden. The naval battle in the Sea of Japan shattered the racial discrimination held by various countries. Therefore, its significance is extremely important. The absolute sense of rigidity held by Western nations before the Russo-Japanese War and the unconscious complacency of East Asian nations were taught a lesson by this war, and they rose up. The Self-Strengthening Movement in China and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Xinhai Revolution are examples. From the Meiji Restoration, the Russo-Japanese War occurred 37 years later, and now, 37 years later, the Greater East Asia War has occurred. The scale and nature of the Greater East Asia War are complex and profound, and cannot be compared to the Russo-Japanese War.</p>
<p>The War Situation Becomes Increasingly Significant</p>
<p>The current war situation is becoming increasingly significant, and its future course is beyond our ability to predict. The war aims of the Greater East Asia War are to establish permanent peace in East Asia and to preserve the glory of Japan. We, the Japanese people, should grasp the aims of this war and strive to complete it. Recalling that the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States to complete China's independence and liberate Asia, it is working towards the completion of the war from a position of living and dying together with Japan. This is something for which I am immensely grateful. However, some elements in China are still lured by anti-Axis propaganda, dreaming of their victory, and adopting a fence-sitting attitude. This is due to a lack of understanding of the essence of the Greater East Asia War. If the Greater East Asia War is not completed, the Chinese nation's fate will be difficult to accomplish. Since the Japanese army entered China, it has stood on the front line, repelling foreign enemies who invaded East Asia, guided by the spirit of righteousness, and seeking to ensure permanent peace in East Asia. The Greater East Asia War can only inherit the name and tradition of the Russo-Japanese War and Japan's national polity if it is based on the spirit of righteousness. Moreover, this war can be called a great war of the era, but yesterday's enemy is no longer today's friend, and today's enemy is Britain and the United States. To complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>China and Japan Cooperate and Support Each Other</p>
<p>It is sincerely necessary for the various nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to cooperate wholeheartedly. It is particularly inevitable for the two nations of China and Japan, which are the center of East Asia, to truly cooperate and support each other. This has been clearly stated in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. The actual achievements of Sino-Japanese cooperation should be based on the Japanese military and civilians understanding the essence of the Greater East Asia War and practicing it wholeheartedly. The Japanese serving in this country should unite their determination, devote themselves to public service, and live up to the expectations of hundreds of millions of people in allied nations. They must also be cautious in their words and deeds to overcome the current difficult situation and devote their efforts to fighting until victory is achieved.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japan's New Policy Towards China Bears Fruit <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Ambassador to China, Masayuki Tani, recently inspected various parts of China, focusing on the new policy towards China, smoothly communicating and integrating the special circumstances of various localities with the central government, and has achieved great results. At the same time, the new policy is being implemented in various places, gradually achieving the expected results. The government's autonomy is gradually penetrating various places, and the promotion of the new policy is becoming a solid foundation. Regarding the issue of commodity prices and other current issues, the solutions have been found through the unified cooperation of the Japanese authorities with the policies implemented by the National Government. The above points have made a great contribution. Strongly promoting the policy towards China is becoming clearer, and the important pending issues of the new policy will be resolved sequentially soon.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Sino-Japanese Joint Venture Company Adjustments Completed <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the second adjustment of the Sino-Japanese joint venture company, since the relevant authorities have conducted intensive consultations, it has been largely decided. This adjustment work will begin with the Central China Fisheries Company, followed by the adjustment of the remaining eleven companies. The adjustment policy aims to adjust the composition of personnel and capital. In the past, if our investment amount and the number of directors were less than those of the Japanese side, they will be changed in this adjustment to obtain the same ratio as the Japanese side, or even more than the Japanese side. Moreover, the characteristic of this adjustment is that the newly acquired enemy property taken over by our side will be used as our investment to form the adjustment capital. For example, the Central China Communications Company's telegraph and telephone companies, the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Central China Electric Power Company, the West Shanghai Electric Power Company, and the tram company of the Central China Coal Industry Company are expected to follow the example of the Central China Fisheries Company and use capital increase as our in-kind investment.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e4">A Word of Congratulations on the Army Day of Allied Nation Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-nine years ago today, in the Battle of Mukden in the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army displayed its power, laying the cornerstone of victory and initiating the great cause of national prosperity. Therefore, this day was designated as Army Day. Today, we are pleased to celebrate the 39th anniversary and express our admiration.</p>
<p>Why is the bravery of the Japanese army worthy of being called the world's best? Because the Japanese army has a traditional samurai spirit, and at the same time, it does not only value martial valor, but also cultivates literature, is good at poetry, takes benevolence and chivalry to heart, is humble and values ​​honor. Once encountering an enemy, they tell each other their addresses and names, maintain a solemn and dignified appearance, compete in martial arts, and once the superiority is determined, the victor dares not humiliate the dead. As for sniping and assassination, they are especially despised by samurai.</p>
<p>However, modern military progress must be coordinated with politics. Military affairs and politics have an inseparable close relationship. Regarding this point, the Japanese army has produced many talented people and has made achievements early on. Lieutenant General Kawabe Masazumi, former Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces in China, published an article entitled "A Message to the Soldiers in China" on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 two years ago, urging the soldiers in China to: 1. Establish the strictest military discipline; 2. Practice the word "sincerity"; 3. Respect the traditional customs of the Chinese people. Mr. Kawabe said: "The Chongqing side is still stubbornly clinging to its errors and continuing to resist, because it has not yet trusted Japan's sincerity." This "sincerity" is the condition for superiors to gain the love of the people in China for thousands of years, and it is also the condition for political operation. Therefore, we can say that the Japanese army stationed in China can be said to be successful militarily. At the same time, Mr. Kawabe said, "Liberate China, get rid of the oppression of Britain and the United States, help it complete its independence, and establish good neighborly relations with it forever." Colonel Seishin Machida also said: "Japan has recognized China and the world after six years of war, so Japan cannot exist without joining hands with China... If each of the one million military and civilians in China can gain Chinese comrades, and if 100 million Chinese people are truly their comrades, the incident will have been resolved long ago." Both Kawabe Masazumi and Machida Seishin are responsible generals in the Allied Forces in China. They have fully explained that political coordination is necessary in addition to military affairs to achieve true cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<p>As for the point of "respecting the traditional customs of the people," it is especially important. China has recognized the military discipline and the "sincerity" of the Allied soldiers, but often, due to the differences between the traditional customs of the Chinese and Japanese people, all efforts are adversely affected. Moreover, because of the gap between the temperament of the Allied soldiers and the unique straightforwardness of the Chinese people, great misunderstandings often arise from small problems. Therefore, "respecting the traditional customs of the Chinese people" is a very important factor in promoting true cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Secondly, the excellent daily training of the Japanese army is even more commendable. For example, the late famous Chinese military strategists Chiang Pai-li and Huang Yen-pai, as well as Chiang Kai-shek, who is now in Chongqing leading the resistance, all studied in the Japanese army. As Colonel Machida said, "Having fought against the armies of Russia, Britain, the United States, the Philippines, Australia, and China, the best is the Chinese army." Unfortunately, Chongqing is being used by Britain and the United States and continues to resist, and has not yet promoted comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan. At the same time, as Minister Misaki said, "In the future, the Chinese mainland will be regarded as an important strategic goal by the anti-Axis forces, and it shows the character of the final decisive battlefield of the Greater East Asia War." We cannot but regard this as the greatest misfortune and regret. On this Army Day of the Allied nation, we hope that the Allied army will, in addition to military affairs, universally value the close relationship between politics and military affairs, and fully display the most commendable samurai spirit, thereby promoting comprehensive cooperation between China and Japan and completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>General Hata said: "In the Greater East Asia War, it is sincerely necessary for the various nations and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia to cooperate wholeheartedly. However, it is particularly necessary for the two nations of China and Japan, which are the center of East Asia, to truly cooperate and support each other."

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base on the Burmese front reports: Since February 2, 4,000 West African troops have responded to the British 7th Division, which was annihilated in the Buthidaung area, and advanced south from the left bank of the Kaladan River, attempting to threaten the Japanese army from the side. However, the Japanese army's elite troops suddenly launched a preemptive attack after sunset on the 1st.

The unit continued south along the Kaladan River, starting from a certain place, and in coordination with two other units, crossed the Kaladan River north of a certain place and began a fierce attack. The enemy's main force, which was gathering in the Putwakin and Apaukwa areas, was cut off from its retreat to the northeast due to the rapid advance of the Japanese army, and was also attacked by a certain unit of the Japanese army south of Apaukwa. Therefore, the enemy army fled in panic and began to retreat along the Kavpye River, a tributary of the Kaladan River at the foot of the Maungdaw Mountains, and the Japanese army continued to pursue them, and is still continuing to launch a magnificent pursuit battle. Kakte has now been occupied by the Japanese army. The enemy's claim to have captured the area has been completely exposed.</p>

<p>Differences of Opinion Between Britain, America and Chongqing</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base on the Burmese front, a Domei News Agency war correspondent recently met with young intellectuals and officers who had been captured and returned to Japan from Britain, America, and Chongqing on the Burmese front. They frankly and in detail described the differences in the war aims of the three groups of Britain, America, and Chongqing, and their domestic trends, as well as the issue of Japan's treatment of prisoners. It is known that the divisions of opinion and the depth of entanglement on the enemy's side are beyond imagination. The following is a record of the questions and answers: Question: What is the purpose of fighting? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao Zhenshan of Chongqing (29 years old, commander of a squad in the 30th Division of the First Army of the Chongqing stationed-in-India joint army), Chongqing has no war aims. Chongqing's resistance is an act to preserve the behavior of the dictator. Britain and the United States take the opportunity to plot to. Although they often tell the Chongqing side to provide assistance. But the Chongqing side does not receive any real benefits, fearing that Chongqing will cooperate with Japan. When I lived with the American army in India, I deeply felt the arrogance of the American soldiers and often bullied the Chongqing soldiers. Therefore, it is fundamentally difficult for the British and Americans to get along with the Chinese. 2. GA Second Lieutenant of the American Army (24 years old, a graduate of Illinois Normal University, assigned to a certain fighting division of the American Air Force stationed in India), the American war aim is to seek not to lose everything, but seeing the American willingness to sacrifice so much, there is also an external pursuit, that is, to replace Britain in dominating Australia, Canada, India, and even dominating Chongqing after the war. The United States claims to be a country that argues for freedom, but on the issue of war, it always adheres to the opinions of the general public. Therefore, the American war aims are roughly like this. 3. Captain C of the British Army (a graduate of the Department of Animal Husbandry at Liverpool University, attached to the British Transportation Command stationed in India, and a graduate student at the Calcutta Jungle School), the British war aim is to restore the pre-war equilibrium in Europe to maintain its own world colony. Now Britain is engaged in war with the assistance of the United States, so the relationship between Britain and the United States is very close. India, Australia, and Canada may be placed under American power, but if Britain can gain victory with American assistance, it will then buy them back from the hands of the American war. The British know the tyranny of the Americans, but now is not the time to compete, so Britain endures and re-endures in order to use American materials. This is the consistent thinking of the British. Question: What is the trend of the domestic people? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao, the people under Chongqing's rule all know that the longer the war lasts, the harder life becomes, so they hope that the war will end soon. 2. Lieutenant GA, the Americans believe that after this war, whether Britain wins or loses, it must be weak, and the United States can take advantage of the victory to conquer the world. This psychology of the Americans may change due to the increasing losses with the prolongation of the war, but in order to win the war, the United States must be fully mobilized no matter what. 3. Captain C, the British people believe that the arrival of peace will be later than the First World War, so it is difficult to predict how the lives of the people will be. The current common hope of the British people is for the European war to end as soon as possible. Question: Regarding Japan's treatment of prisoners of war from the enemy countries in Arakan, Britain and the United States broadcast that Japan is inhumane. What is the dissatisfaction? Answer: 1. Lieutenant Jiao, I am not a prisoner of war, so I have nothing to say. After defecting this time, I live and eat with the Japanese soldiers, and the treatment is exactly the same. I feel that the Japanese army is very fair. 2. Lieutenant GA, I have never felt that I have been treated cruelly or inhumanely as a prisoner of war. Daily drinking and poverty are the same as the Japanese army. We make our own food and eat it ourselves. Life is regular and suitable for inspection, so people feel no injustice at all. 3. Captain C, I suffered from malaria and often had a high fever. The Japanese young military doctor enthusiastically treated me. I am a prisoner of war, but I am very grateful to be able to receive such kindness.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the National Government officially participated in the war, in order to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and jointly share the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, all policies aim to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power. To achieve this goal, the economic system has been decisively changed from liberalism to a controlled economic policy. Although it has only been implemented for a short time, the unified cooperation of the government and the public has achieved considerable results. It is reported that in order to enable the controlled economic policy to achieve further effectiveness, so as to complete the task of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power, it is planned to further strengthen and improve the existing control mechanisms and control policies in accordance with the needs of the actual environment. Since this matter has been carefully researched by the relevant parties, it has now reached a concrete stage and has obtained more appropriate and detailed methods. It is firmly believed that after its implementation soon, the National Government's economic system will have another epoch-making development, and the work of stabilizing people's livelihoods and enhancing combat power will be powerfully guaranteed and its completion will be accelerated.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Countries in Southeastern Europe Pay Close Attention to Developments in the War Situation <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 9th (Central News Agency) – Since the Soviet army on the southern front of Hebetovka-Poloskorov launched an offensive on the 4th, it is less than 200 kilometers away from Romania and only 250 kilometers away from Hungary. Therefore, the countries in southeastern Europe are paying close attention to the developments in the war situation. Marshal Zhukov led approximately 13 divisions of the Soviet army and elite mechanized units in an attempt to break through the German defense line. So far, they have approached the German positions and reached the Lemberg railway line, launching a fierce offensive and defensive battle in the muddy roads where snow is melting. The German authorities had anticipated the Soviet army's intention to attack in that area, but the speed of the Soviet army's advance in the muddy roads was unexpected. The German authorities specifically explained the significance of the Soviet army's operation as follows: If the Lemberg-Odessa line is cut off, the German positions will be withdrawn 300 kilometers eastward from that location. Therefore, the railway is of great strategic importance. If the railway, the vital communication line between Budapest and Bucharest, is attacked, the German army will be greatly affected. The Soviet Union wants to confront Britain and the United States, so it is eager to occupy the southeastern part of Polish territory and invade Romania. It is reported that the German headquarters has deployed strong combat power in that area to thwart the Soviet army's attempt, hoping to give the Soviet army a major counterattack when the winter war ends.</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Organization and Education of the Japanese Army <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Today marks the thirty-ninth Army Day of our ally, Japan. As the Greater East Asia War gradually enters a tense stage, the task of the allied Japanese army in defeating the enemy becomes increasingly arduous. The spirit of the samurai will be further brought into play, and they will surely accomplish the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. On this Army Day of our ally, as this Greater East Asia War approaches victory, we deeply admire the brave and skilled fighting of the allied Japanese army. However, the perfection of the army's organizational structure and the excellence of its military education are also major factors in achieving victory. Therefore, we have extracted and translated this article from the 1943 edition of the "Military Yearbook of the Army and Navy" to introduce the organizational structure and educational aspects of the Japanese army, providing a reference for our countrymen.</p>
<p>The supreme command in Japan is normally the General Staff Headquarters in peacetime, headed by the Chief of the General Staff. In wartime, the Supreme Command Headquarters is established under the Emperor, known as the Imperial Headquarters. The Chief of the General Staff reports directly to the Emperor, and together with the Chief of the Naval General Staff, they serve as heads of their respective staffs, assisting in the affairs of the imperial court, planning operations, and coordinating the efforts of the army and navy.</p>
<p>In peacetime, they investigate military affairs, geography, resources, transportation, and communications both domestically and abroad, and formulate plans for national defense and military operations. In wartime, they implement these plans under imperial command. However, the supreme command of the armed forces is personally exercised by the Emperor (as commander-in-chief).</p>
<p>In wartime, to ensure the flawless execution of operations, military command and military administration must be unified. All military administration related to the operational forces is under the control of the Imperial Headquarters.</p>
<p>(General Staff Headquarters) is in charge of defense and military operations. The Chief of the General Staff (appointed from the rank of army general or lieutenant general) reports directly to the Emperor and assists in military affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Yamazaki Hotel Murder Case: District Court Completed Trial Yesterday <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Sentence to be Pronounced on the 16th of This Month</p>
<p>Central News Agency: In the morning of October 9th of last year, a female guest was found strangled to death in the Japanese-owned Yamazaki Hotel on Wujin Road (formerly known as Old Baz Road) in this city. The incident was immediately reported to the Hongkou Medical Office, which had jurisdiction over the area. The judicial section of the office dispatched personnel to investigate secretly and learned that the deceased was named Chen Wantong, also known as Sun Qinshu, who had worked as a health worker in Nanjing City. The murderer, Wu Wen, was subsequently arrested in Nanjing and transferred to Shanghai. After investigation by the medical office, he was transferred to the local prosecutor's office for interrogation and then sent to this city's District Court, where he was indicted on three counts: premeditated murder and theft. The District Court held its first hearing yesterday (9th) at 3:00 PM. The defendant, Wu Wen, also hired a lawyer to defend him. Chen Peiyi, the eldest daughter of the deceased, Chen Wantong, attended the hearing as the plaintiff. Wu Wen, the defendant, was first questioned. He was 37 years old, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and taught as a teaching officer at the Central Police Academy. He had a teacher-student relationship with the deceased at Nanyang High School seven or eight years ago. They met on the road in Nanjing at the end of 1942 and subsequently developed a relationship. Regarding the murder of the deceased, he claimed it was accidental manslaughter under the influence of alcohol. In addition, he attributed the deceased's false name, Cao Xiuzhen, card, seal, etc., to the deceased's possession during her lifetime. Subsequently, Chen Peiyi, the deceased's daughter, was called to testify. She testified in court on behalf of her mother. The court stated that the case was clear and argued to the defendant that the deceased's murder was clearly a premeditated design, and there was no need to deny it. After the court concluded the trial, it was scheduled to pronounce the sentence at 10:00 AM on the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Thorough Investigation of Hoarding: Prices in This City Fall: Hope Authorities Will Further Enforce Laws <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News from Central News Agency) Prices in this city have soared in the past two months, especially the rise in essential goods, which has been as high as one to two times. The reason for this is that general merchants with capital are speculating and hoarding, and some financial institutions are using depositors' funds to hoard goods secretly, creating a situation where rare goods are available for sale. The government authorities, in view of this, in order to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, convened a price coordination meeting by the Ministry of Industry and decided to control prices by addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, on the one hand, thoroughly investigating hoarding of goods and imposing strict penalties according to law, and on the other hand, the Central Reserve Bank stopped interbank lending and restricted the lending business of various banks and estates. General domestic merchants were greatly panicked and lowered prices to sell their goods. The falling trend has not stopped in the last two days. If the authorities further implement the suppression laws, prices may continue to fall.</p>

<p>After the silver industry, various banks, and estates implemented tight lending to prevent speculation and hoarding, they have recently been adjusted by the Central Reserve Bank and the Bankers' Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve Treasury. The foundation has been substantially strengthened, so production loans for various industries are granted under the compliance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance and the restrictions of the Central Reserve Bank and the Guild's regulations. However, the review of the applicant's use is even stricter to prevent abuses and maintain normal industrial and commercial industries.</p>

<p>The relevant authorities believe that increasing production is very important under this wartime system, and the government has set this year as the General Mobilization Year for increasing production, so various factories are given various assistance, such as allocating raw materials and facilitating transportation. It is reported that the recent work rate of most major factories has reached about 80% of the pre-incident level, and some have even exceeded the pre-incident level. Among them, the industries with the highest work rate are rayon, printing, machinery manufacturing and repair, followed by bicycle manufacturing, paper manufacturing, rubber industry, and flour industry.</p>

<p>— Report by the Chief of the Information Department of the China Expeditionary Army, Lieutenant Colonel Mishina</p>
<p>As we face an unprecedentedly severe war situation and approach the 39th Army Day, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. The Russo-Japanese War was a righteous war to ensure peace in the Far East and for Japan to rise up for its own freedom and self-defense, as clearly stated in the Imperial Rescript of February 10th, Meiji 37.</p>
<p>In terms of the true meaning of the Holy War to protect East Asia, the Russo-Japanese War, the later Manchurian Incident, the China Incident, and the Greater East Asia War are consistent. Japan, for the defense and prosperity of all nations and countries in East Asia, took the lead in the first war.</p>
<p>What is the fundamental reason for achieving successive victories in waging war under such conditions? Although it is said to be due to the Emperor's divine authority, we cannot help but think deeply about the innate sense of superiority and tyranny of the European powers towards the Asian nations since the Three-Power Intervention of Liaodong after the Sino-Japanese War. Our 50 million people could no longer tolerate it, so they endured hardship and prepared for ten years, which led to today's rise.</p>
<p>Popular Sentiment during the Russo-Japanese War</p>
<p>At that time, Japan, a small island nation in the Far East, rose up to stop the eastward expansion of the world's most powerful continental nation, Tsarist Russia. The situation was extremely tragic, and the world was not without the illusion of a mantis trying to stop a chariot. Their population was 170 million, while we had only 50 million; their peacetime military strength was 1.24 million, while we had only 120,000. In terms of firearms, they had machine guns that we did not know about, which made the Russian soldiers feel very distressed. The war lasted for 20 months, and nearly 100,000 people were sacrificed. Our country fought with all its strength. During the Battle of Mukden, although we seized an excellent opportunity to annihilate the enemy, we watched the enemy escape with regret due to the lack of rear support, which is still being talked about to this day. This also shows the extent of our national power at that time. In a corner of the icy and snowy Northeast, dozens of young people, in preparation for the day of avenging this humiliation, pledged blood as an alliance and formed a society. Some young people felt the pain of "national weakness leading to humiliation" and "if the will is weak, it cannot be implemented." For the sake of cultivating comrades and establishing an early morning meeting, they never stopped, continuing like this for fifty years to this day. The Yōsei-kai, with Ito Shigenori as its president at the time, was such an organization. Based on this, one can get a glimpse of the national spirit at that time.</p>
<p>In terms of the domestic and international situation at the time, the Russo-Japanese War had the possibility of progressing to a protracted war. Japan's war power and national power were completely different from today. In terms of the strength to conduct a protracted war, there was no certainty.</p>
<p>However, relying on the nation's deep awareness of the national crisis, the nation's preparation and training, especially the deep sense of the national polity, the coordination of military operations and national affairs, controlling the appropriate measures, and relying on the spiritual power of the national polity, we were able to destroy the strong Russia, save the East Asian crisis, and complete the war objectives. This is something that we must deeply engrave in our hearts today.</p>
<p>The Two Major Ethnic Groups of East Asia</p>
<p>Relying on the victory of the Russo-Japanese War, Japan's national power developed to the continent and became a rising nation in East Asia, gradually forming the position of an important defense center in the north. In the Battle of Mukden, we defeated the Russian army, which was about twice our size. In the Battle of Tsushima in the Sea of Japan, we overturned a large fleet of over thirty ships; we shattered the erroneous racial prejudice. The facts and lessons shattered the absolute sense of superiority of the Western ethnic groups and the innate sense of inferiority of the self-abandonment of the Eastern ethnic groups. Japan's determination and national power gave the dying and sinking Eastern ethnic group the light like the rising sun. It awakened the ethnic consciousness of the latent Asian nations. From then on, in terms of independent countries in the East, there was a movement to establish national states, and in terms of conquered countries, it induced national independence movements. In this way, we painfully feel that today, the two major ethnic groups in East Asia have become the axis of joint defense, driving out the common enemies of Britain and the United States from the homeland of East Asia, and constructing the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, that is, the group of nations of East Asia centered on Japan, which was already conceived in the Russo-Japanese War forty years ago. The Greater East Asia War is now plunging into an unprecedentedly fierce war situation in the northern and southeastern Pacific Ocean, on the southwestern Asian continent, and on the China mainland front. The victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War not only determines the rise and fall of Japan, but also concerns the rise and fall of all East Asian nations. The vastness of the battle lines, the magnitude of the consumption of human and material resources, and the magnificence and complexity of the war's scale are not comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. The key to the future of the war is also not comparable to the Russo-Japanese War. Modern warfare is total war, and there is no distinction between the front and the rear. From now on, the domestic rear should deeply realize the tangible and intangible attacks of the enemy. 100 million people cannot but realize that in order to complete the protracted war, there must be tens of thousands of sacrifices, and the day of total armament of the elderly, young, men, and women civilians. However, in this war, due to the results of the initial battles, the vast and inexhaustible southern key resource zone has been completely occupied, and there are also unlimited underground resources on the mainland. The longer the war, the more advantageous it is for us. This point is completely different from the fervor during the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, the establishment of our "war to feed war" strategic posture is now fiercely opposed by the British and American counterattacks and the Central Pacific strategy. The attempt to recapture Burma is now as fierce as the sun.</p>
<p>Making the Greatest Effort for War Aims</p>
<p>Nimitz once boasted that he wanted to traverse the Pacific, "not only using air force, but also landing ground troops on the Chinese mainland to attack the Japanese mainland." The Chinese mainland has become an important strategic goal for the anti-Axis forces in the future, and in a sense, it exhibits the character of the final decisive battleground of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the aerial decisive battle on the mainland is intensifying, and the indiscriminate killing of non-combatants is a means of nerve warfare often used by the enemy. Their guns are clearly aimed at the innocent populace. There is no one idle in the current war. It is actually ourselves who are fighting. Victory or defeat all depends on the decision of each national in the rear to carry out the war. In particular, I hope that the Japanese people in business will deeply understand the Imperial Rescript, thoroughly understand the good faith of the new policy towards China, and put it into practice clearly, and move forward in their respective positions.</p>
<p>The situation of a long-term war and a three-dimensional total war has gradually revealed its signs on the mainland. In a protracted war, each nation should, of course, devote all its strength to enhancing its war power in order to complete the military war, and at the same time, it should also become the strongest and most excellent warrior in the important elements of the protracted war, such as political war, ideological war, diplomatic war, and economic war. One victory or defeat, one advance or retreat in the armed forces is a wave on the way to the comprehensive application of war power and political power. The ever-changing war situation and the enormous consumption on the European front have taught us a great deal. Regarding the use of troops and operations, the entire nation must absolutely not harbor anxieties or secretly discuss them. It is only necessary to devote all its energy and effort to completing the war objectives. In wartime, each national's position is the battlefield. Each should keep to his own duty, make his greatest effort for the war aims, and fight to the final moment of victory. No matter what difficulties are encountered, the belief in certain victory and the determination to complete the war must not be abandoned.</p>
<p>The Belief That the Final Victory is Doubtless</p>
<p>The sacred intention of the Meiji Emperor, who had the ideal of Eastern peace, became the blood of 100,000 loyal subjects. Three generations of prosperity have succeeded one another, and the founding of Manchukuo has taken place. The country of Manchukuo is now placed on the security of a rock. A billion people in East Asia also follow with admiration. We have solemn war objectives, a great and strong strategic posture, inexhaustible human and material resources, and a national polity that is unparalleled in the world. We cannot help but feel deeply moved and happy. The final victory of the war is a belief that is beyond doubt. To make all of humanity recognize the power of the Japanese national polity.</p>
<p>Our expeditionary army will thoroughly destroy the British and Americans, and to save all the Chinese people whom the British and Americans want to enslave, we will inflict a painful blow on all British and American forces on the mainland. We will never withdraw from the Holy War until the four million people on the mainland truly obtain a peaceful and prosperous life, and until the construction of all of China is completed. This is the only way to repay the heroic spirits of our fathers and grandfathers who fell one after another in the Russo-Japanese War and gave their lives for righteousness. (Translated from the Takukoku Shinpo, March 9)</p>
