<h3 id="c1">京滬兩市民食臨時措置綱要頒布以後 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月二十四日，行政院頒布「京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要」以後，本市各界咸極注意，因為政府當局臨時措置之主旨，無疑是針對目前京滬兩市食米問題的困難，而期調節來源，漸趨合理解決。年來本市食米問題，治絲益棼，困難日甚，所以，對此臨時措置，莫不寄以深切之期待。</p>
<p>誠然，綱要頒布以後，僅僅數日，談不到若何效果。可是，一部分的反響，據傳內地米」價暴漲，本市亦有漲無落。這些雖是過渡時期的不正常現象，未能遽加論斷。但於綱要內容，不無可以研究之處，而實施細節辦法，更有從速規定的必要。二十六日新聞報經濟社論中提出意見三點：　強制收買與自由移動總是矛盾，應予調整。　米統會按成征購，僅針對採辦商，農民負米入市，是否在征購之列，應加明確規定。　征購價格按實際成本另加合理利潤，所謂實際成本很難計算，如何合理規定，極為重要。我們很有同感。這裹，補充管見數點：　過去食米來源，農民負米入市銷售者，個別數量雖不多，而總數亦極可觀。在且由移動充裕食米的觀點，對於附近農民將自己收獲之米榖運至市區內銷售，數量在一石以內煮，米統會免予征購，並免予領取護照，以期流暢。</p>
<p>綱要第五條「苟無米統會護照而搬入米穀時，以私米論，按照中央法令懲處之。」第六條「米統會在京滬兩市指定搬入口，設臨時頒發護照處，並得隨時對未經請領護照之米商，給以搬運護照。」按第五條之「苟無米統會護照而搬入米榖時，以私米論」，當指無護照搬米而己經通過搬入口而言，因為第六條已經規定指定搬入口，對未經請領護照之米商隨時發給搬運護照。兩條文原意，二面獎勵米源便利搬入，因而指定入口處臨特發給護照，一面防止私運，逃避微購。但第五條須明白解釋，以免流弊。所謂私米，指已通過搬入口無護照者而口，並非無護照而運至搬入口時，卽為私米。第六條臨時發給護照，以不收費用為原則，否則規定公費外，絕對公正迅速，便利搬入，如有留難需案，准予隨時告發，對辦事人員嚴懲，以杜弊責。入口處宣布　　。俾衆週知。</p>
<p>所謂實際成本，確難計算，尤其在「苛雜高於一切」的惡劣環境中，更無從計算。共次，火車運米，常有「十取共二」之事，亦其一端。所以，欲求「實際成本」成為「實際」，首先取締一切苛雜，其次，取締運輸流弊。我們建議組織護米隊，由軍警保護，然後集團運輸。</p>
<p>食米管理機關應從速訂定食米管理辦法，運米到達市區後，迅速處理。管理辦法中，應注意（一）厲行登記手續，（二）買賣以同業公會會員為限，但在同一地區同等資格之同業間不得互相買賣，以防止投機。（三）米糧到滬或進倉庫後，在規定之限期內，務須依照市價出售，否則應加薄懲，並照市價由米統會收買。同時，大批食米到埠，應指定米船碼頭。</p>
<p>最後，徒法不能自行，我們始終認定，人事問題的澈底調整，絕對是先決條件，如果米統會的人專不先健全，則一切措置，結果徒具形式而已。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日越軍緊密聯繋越北部防衛鞏固　集結邊境渝軍嚴重監視中 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>西責二十八日中央社電南北部正面之廣西雲南兩省集結之三十萬渝軍之動向，今已成為越南之重大問題。渝軍為打開印緬前綫之苦境，企圖於日軍後方蠢動，實行產制作戰。麼尖登將軍麾下之十萬越南戰，特以連結朗遜東丹下卡奧朗哈　勞凱沿綫之要塞裴坦苛為基地，執戈待機，並與日軍精說緊密相携，强化越南北部之防衛。越南北部正面之渝軍雖無出繫越南之戰力，然其逐次增强戰力之事實，則不可不加注意。現下越南北部之防衛鞏如磐石，美軍刻正狂奔力使越南北部正而之渝軍美園化，是近特向此等廣西雲南兩省之渝軍，派遣美人敎官團實巡迴敎練，並對此等渝陸軍之裝備，特以美國式武器使之强化。由於種情形，越南之防衛須由强化國內態勢作起。</p>
<p>越南强化國內態勢</p>
<p>是以越南國內態勢强化運動着着進行，由於學校敎育之强化及大學運動鄉軍運動之擴大，並舉行越南聯邦會議等。又越南當局最近對於華僑之再詛織工作，彝有新之成功，即解消中國人與越南人之對立，越南當局即乘此機强化越南國內熊勢，重新組織僑居越南之數萬華僑，並對疊時越用與中國南方各地之自田交易，施以嚴格統制。</p>
<p>此外最近越南情勢中最堪注目者，即法駐日新大使戈思默及駐泰代理大使卡斯安之訪問越南，與德古總習會設一事，德古總醫不以總督資格臨席，而以法國太平洋總醫之立塲開陳意見，些二者會談，似就法國在外機關下新東亞對策有所檢討，撤回駐渝外交官，將受國府承認之微妙至極之法國動向，早晚必將明確化，此點由于其最近日本芳澤大使與戈思默大使之活躍，對于今後歸趨實堪注目。</p>
<p>襲拉巴爾敵機　被擊毀九架</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電拉巴爾電；廿七日有敵B25B24P40型機約一百八十架來襲拉巴爾，經日機邀繫後，共擊落其五架，擊毀其四架，日方損失甚輕微。</p>
<h3 id="c3">北千島兵精糧足　　準備長期戰　　敵妄圖進犯必遭痛擊 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央軍，同時糧食亦有充分預社電日東北方面第一綫備努力儲存，以備長期作基地之某部隊長，以敵　戰。尼米資發狂聽，自北方進攻日本，頃特就此發表談話，其大意如次：阿圖島玉碎後，北千島兵力立即增强，現北千島約有陸上部隊若干團，中南千島約有若干團，合計若干團，更有鐵筋之碉堡及防空壕等設備，亦有堅固之山地岩磐要塞，極為堅實。去年自某部隊長到任後，厲兵秣馬更見旺盛，百萬大敵進攻亦不足懼，陸海軍飛機塲合計共有若干處，現有多數飛機待命。於日軍嚴重哨戒下，若敵運轍船團以若干　之速度前進，到達海岸則　若干小時，况敵船決不能突破具有科學裝備之監視網，且海岸配置之各種新武器，均已試射完了，預待擊潰敵</p>
<p>太平洋戰局入第二階段</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電海軍評論家賽孟，頃於英週刊畫報五月二十一日號上發表一文，說明太平洋海戰，已入主力艦隊戰階段，其大意如次：吾等為攻學日本，實施三千架四引擊轟炸機之訓練時，至少須有延長補裝滑翔路至三千六百哩，又每當向東京之侵攻路縮這五百哩時，則必須有五十機塲之增設。餘如氣候關係，自印緬方面之攻擊，絕不容許繼續半年以上之作戰，現下緬甸公路便可運一萬五千噸軍需品，　不足補給英軍師一個月之需用，因此重點，緬甸公路除可作為　渝軍之心理援助外，於將來之戰局上殆無功用。然轉觀太平洋時，則一切情事逈異，日本為確保其廣大之海上交通綫，料必擁有有力戰艦為主力之大艦隊與多數潛艇，且德國之潛艇並非已由大西洋掃除凈盡，提魯畢茲以次之德國之殘存戰艦，依然於北海襲擊英美有力艦隊。日軍為對抗英美航空母艦羣，刻正於太平洋上數島　上建設機塲，日本自戰爭伊始，即已覺悟今次大職之長期化，第一階段業已過去，刻正建設及開展其佔領地域，對此，美英海軍之戰略，　於威爾茲號與列巴魯斯號因山動狹窄海面遭擊沉之經騐，於基地飛機行動圈外之大洋上誘出日本艦隊，是以今後之海戰，將必廣亘世界最大海洋而為艦隊之一大決戰。</p>

<p>鄭州二十八日中央社電日軍　身隊於此次河南作戰中，曾壓建大功，尤其於覆減盧氏飛機塲，及其他軍事設施時，其勇敢作戰情形，實足驚人。按該部隊接受進攻盧氏命令時，為五月十四日夜半。盧氏位於洛陽西南約二百公里，為連結西安梁山漢中各空軍基地之要地，最近更以之為對日總反攻之前進據點，其設施已較前强化。日軍部隊自嵩縣附近出發後，即開始由伏牛山之天險進擊，跋涉泥濘之道路，於五日黎明抵審峪街（嵩縣西南二十公里），急襲渝第十三師，將之潰滅，幷殲減二十軍之一師。更乘勢猛追潰走中之百七十七師渝兵二千，於除雨中展開壯烈之遊擊戰。至十六日午後，在西營（嵩縣西方四十公里）北方，將殘敗渝軍，以急襲將之殲減。其後於十八日，又與企圖阻止日軍進擊而來襲之敵軍，展開職鬥，是役計斃渝軍及俘獲達五百三十四人，並佔領米口，十九日急渡洛河，逎迫盧氏南側，越過距嵩縣約百公里之險峻道路，待至十九日拂嘵，接受攻擊命令後，該隊勇士即踴躍將渝軍之一部包圍殲減。待至二十日上午五時三十分，將盧氏佔領，同時更將飛行塲之滑走路倉庫及其他附屬設施等，悉予澈底破壞。至常日十一時許，該隊因任務業已完成，遂開始撤退，至二十日止，已撤退完畢云。</p>

<p>— 宮慶治</p>
<p>D級戰艦的出現</p>
<p>如是，世界的戰艦乃起革命。現就是英國於明治三十九年（一九〇六年）造成了裝　十二叶主砲十門的戰艦。這艘軍艦便是有名的「特萊特諾脫」（Dreachaughl）號，是二艘一萬七千九百噸的軍艦，其副砲為十二門專供擊退奇襲小艦艇用的十二磅砲（七·六公分砲）。建造此型軍艦的，是以後榮任元帥的資熙男爵（Baron　Fsher）。　行到日木「　寧」「安釀」兩艦裝備口徑和主砲相差無幾的十吋砲十門成功之後，猜想用十二吋砲代巷十吋砲大槪也無礙，同時於兩舷，以期任何一舷皆可用同數巨砲　戰的方法，結果遂完成了這個革命化的設計。</p>
<p>「特萊特諾脫」號有十二吋砲十門，每二門合裝一砲塔，共有砲塔五座。其中二砲塔置於艦尾的中央綫上，三砲塔置於艦首。後者一砲塔在中央綫上，餘二砲塔分置兩舷。所以單舷作戰時也有八門十二吋砲可以吐火，以艦首應戰，則有六門，艦屋作戰則為四門。又，此型軍艦備有蒸汽透平式二萬三千四馬力的機關，所以雖為戰艦而仍能以每時二十二節的高速力航行，舉世為之驚嘆。</p>
<p>甚至於在英國也發生了非難發時誇為絕對世界第一的約五十艘的戰艦隊已成獲式的呼聲，這不有趣嗎？</p>
<p>此後，世界各國各別造出能和這稱新型軍艦對抗的軍艦。日本的「河內」與「攝津」兩艦，也是屬於所謂D型的戰艦。日本雖祇造了此二艦，但別國都拚命建造D級戰艦，不其洛人之後，於是世界上發生了造艦競爭。</p>
<p>超D級戰艦</p>
<p>這樣，英國如不建造校此更有威力的軍艦，則在有事之際將措手不及，所以設計建造裝載更大巨地的更大軍艦。因為是遠勝特萊特　脫型的軍　，故稱超特萊特諾脫型戰艦（亦稱超D級軍艦。</p>
<p>英國何以如此慌張呢？因為「特萊特諾脫」的出現和新興的德國海軍立於同一的出發點。如前所述，英國擁有舊式戰艦五十艘，德閱看到「特萊特諾脫」成功後，立即仿效，先成納茲蘇級（一萬八千五百噸）戰艦四艘，繼造黑爾郭蘭級（二萬一千噸）四隻，於是英德聞的海軍力漸漸接近。英國對德所能誇為優勢者，即在擁有優勢的海軍力，如果兩國的海軍力想　，則英國在歐洲大陸旣無領土，德園便是歐洲的最大强國。倘若德閱擁有頗易擊潰英國海軍而龍護過英吉利海峽的海軍，那末英國必退居第三流國家。造放「特萊特　脫」的英國，不料反因此而處於其海上極力受威脅的立塲。</p>
<p>於是英國迫不得已祇有建造超D型了。</p>
<p>這種超D級戰艦的第一批是一九一一年起一九一二年竣工的奧里翁級四艘，其排水量各為二萬二千五百噸，二聯裝主砲十門，P徑比D級的十二吋砲更大，是十三吋半砲，分裝五個砲塔。其砲塔之配置和D級戰艦不同，全部置於中央綫，艦首艦尾各二座，中央部一座，故以單舷應戰，十門主砲也可全部開火。但用艦首或艦　應戰時，則祗有四門可以發射，是為其缺點，不過威力總遠比D級艦為大。各國其後亦起而仿效，當然是不用說的。</p>
<p>驅逐艦的情形又如何呢？這必須比水雷艇大。而且不但作為水雷艇破壞艦，並當作奇襲部隊而　更佳的功績，所以速力也須快速，並因和艦隊一同行動而航行大洋，所以耍求相當大的　體，以及相當強力的武器，於是其排水量也從日俄戰爭時的三百噸級漸漸加大，例如在英國造的，由G級（八百六十噸——九百四十噸）改為乙級（九百五十噸——一千零三噸），所備大砲也由三吋四門改裝四吋砲四門。至於艦形，則將艦首的甲板加高，俾在風狂浪湧時也得用高速航行，以增加其航洋性</p>
<p>潛水艇在很久以前即被世人想到，但不僅潛入水中而且運能潛航破壞敵方軍艦的思想，則是比較近年的東西。</p>
<p>一七七五年美國哈達維持，勃茲希內爾造成了可潛艇，乘此者用手搖轉推進器，潛航水中，定時炸彈裝在敵軍的艦艇底下。美國獨立戰爭時曾擬用於炸毀英艦，但未成功。其後發明蒸氣船而一擊成名的富爾頓也有同樣的意思，後勃茲希內爾二年，造成了呌做「蒂拉斯從的雪加式潛水艇。這可搭載船員二名，用手搖動推進器前進，行駛水上時則張帆而走。拿破命見之大喜，試作種種實騐，打算用之於實際的戰爭，終無機會，而且拿翁不久亦被敗。（未完）（吉譯自軍艦史話）</p>

<p>出席人士</p>
<p>昨陳市長適因公不克蒞會，派吳秘書長代表出席外，計到了部長·熊保安處長·遊民勞動營　備主任周敏英，社會福利部公益署長張克昌，社會福利局長孫　　，該部駐滬辦事處長陳東白，第二警察局長處英，曁李思浩·康侯·袁履登·五益之·羅洪義·周作民·徐　　·邵式軍·項康原·許　初·丁濟萬·陳彬蘇等不下六十餘人。　由丁部長對　設遊民勞動營動機目的及今後之希望，　述　詐。繼由囯秘書長致詞，深盼地方統力協助，旋由各界領袖李思浩·林康侯·袁履登諸氏發抒高見，莫不深表贊同，乃決定　募經費目的為二千萬元，限六月十五日截止，指定收捐款處計大陸·金城·四明·中國·交通·上海·　與·聯易等銀行，伺潤·福源·泰來等錢莊，及新聞報·中華是報·新中國報·平報·國民新聞·申報等各大報社，地點擬　北新　附近，搭進茅棚營屋，未建竣前，先從南市著手。茲悉，此次決在官民一元化下，進行設置，為積極進行籌備起見，特定於六月三日召開首次董事會。</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>丁社會福利部長席間致詞，略謂：今為籌設上海遊民勞動營，邀請共同商榷，荷承攬冗參加，深為惑激。關於過去收容遊民團體頗少，僅李思浩氏主持之遊民習勸所，頗具成績，此外均未能大量收容。過去政府辦理者雖有，面規模猶未臻完備，爰經社會福利部會同市府辦一理，其名稱方式與工作內容，均稍有不同。蓋過去都偏重工藝，今則側重農藝方面。查我國空地荒地良多，乏入墾顧，以致生產不够，使米糧發生嚴重影響。我國向為農業國之一，竟因生產不足，為求協助增加生產，當决偏於農力勞動。關於工藝勞動，終因原料·電力·銷路種種困難所限止，故提倡農力勞動，不但協助增加生產，且可逐漸廣為推展。此次厘訂之方案，適用全國各地，而以上海啓其端。查遊民各地均有，大可利用荒山荒地，今以上海為出發點，期便各地發生興趣，自勸予以提倡，特別重視，深望各界名流政府提倡下，興力協助，我人以愛國救國之道，應從小點做起，是以今次之方針，深信增產運動有以協助，且治安及公共福利，均有裨益。關於地方治安，不良份子之置跡，在福利上亦有關能淺，即使宵小之拘禁，惟釋後彼輩之生活問題，當亦須加以考慮，查滬地流氓地痞匿受累非淺，此項黑暗習俗，已積數十年之久，本人對此今已下斷然决心，予以掃除，故遊民勞動營工作非做不可。此外如經常費來源，各方均已贊助，而開辦費之籌募，為數亦頗貴，如房屋，制服，農藝工具等，深盼各方努力協助，有錢出錢，有力出力，向各方代為　募，期促早日成功，諒熱心地方諸君，當定於樂助云云。</p>
<p>吳秘書長致詞</p>
<p>吳秘書長致詞略謂：今日本人代表陳市長出席，關於遊民勞動營之意義及動機，了部長已闡述頗詳，且說明希望及抱負良深，刻本人稍予補充。查上海女士之濟助頗多，惟多側於慈善心，以衣粥材施助乞丐，其動機則為十孫造福，因在是項積德思想下，穩定社會治安基礎，今者遊民勞動勞之設　，乃進備工作，好在諸君登高一呼，各方定能樂予襄助，方才了部長說明碼顯之黑暗，本人亦深同惑，蓋上海遊民分有組織無組織之流，如謀彼輩一統組織後，則消減頗為困難，一般失業壯民，最易走上此途，尙有兒童為數頗多，前曾有故友告余，謂此項兒童不下三萬餘名，且均有組織的，迭受成人敎唆，不法作歹，希望遊民勞動營成立後，不但收容成人外，且注重流浪兒童，彼輩在生產上雖乏能力，但養成至將來恐有較成人遊民進一步之作為，，次此今後之工作，偏重於農藝，最好作到自給自耕地位，且劃出一部份種植蔬菜雜糧，而遊民得之歸宿，賴以自足，並盼各位多發宏論云云。</p>
<p>各方意見</p>
<p>李思浩氏意見，首發表紅　字會舉辦遊民習勤所之經過，及官方之督促資助，並說明收容遊民官辦之長處，一般遊民易於就範。最後希望收容成人外，注重收容兒童，並盼各負所責，為遊民勞動營而努力，早日成功云云。　林康侯氏意見，略謂遊民勞動營之發動，是乃上海之福，當今滬地社會日漸墮落，深慮嚴重，自市府設置　詢委員會後，即主張治安，並使失業人予以歸宿，今在社會福利部市府協力下，以顧全上海前途，殊感愉快非常者。本人自港返滬後，即專心於敎餋兒童工作上，蓋國家將不之立足，屬於兒童，並荷承李思浩氏竭力贊同，今流浪兒童，耳聞目及，遍地皆是，瞭望今後社會，不堪設想，且無以保衛治安，此次官方發起此舉實為上海絕大之福音，是盼廣大宣傳，督促成功。關於勸募工作，不妨分別勸募，則成績較佳，深望地方共同負責，協助成功，此外除收容乞丐兒童外，並盼流浪婦女，即路途雉妓，不啻毒蛇猛獸，以挽救下層階級，深望在座共同研究，籌設經費，並祝迅速成立。　袁履登氏意見對肅淸遊民方法採取逐步推進，斯使絕跡，關於籌募方式，深望大家負責，以協助政府此項工作云云。</p>

<p>關於全國商業統制總會改組問題，據悉業經有關各富局研究磋商，確定方案，最短期內當可提經行政院會議討論決定，公布實施。頃從關係方面透露消息，將來商統會改組，加强物資統制機構之大耍，擬强化商統會外圍各業部門主要物品獨立統制任務，如米糧·粉麥。棉業。雜糧。食油。糖業等民生主要食用品物資統制行政，直轄於行政院，商統會則担任監督指導及審議等各種物資統制工作。</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Promulgation of the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Food Supply of Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>After the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Outline of Temporary Measures for the Food Supply of Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai" on the 24th of this month, all sectors in this city paid close attention. The government authorities' main purpose in taking temporary measures is undoubtedly to address the current difficulties in the rice supply in Beijing and Shanghai, to regulate the sources, and gradually move toward a reasonable solution. In recent years, the rice problem in this city has become increasingly complex and difficult. Therefore, everyone places deep hopes on these temporary measures.</p>
<p>Indeed, only a few days have passed since the outline was promulgated, so it is too early to talk about any effects. However, according to some feedback, the price of "domestic rice" has soared, and prices in this city have also been rising. Although these are abnormal phenomena during the transition period, it is too early to draw conclusions. However, there are still aspects of the outline's content that can be studied, and there is a need to quickly formulate detailed implementation measures. The economic editorial in the Shen Bao newspaper on the 26th put forward three points: Mandatory purchase and free movement are always contradictory and should be adjusted. The Rice Unified Association's purchase based on a percentage only targets purchasing merchants. It should be clearly stipulated whether farmers who bring rice to the market are subject to the purchase. The purchase price should be based on actual costs plus a reasonable profit. The so-called actual cost is difficult to calculate, and how to reasonably stipulate it is extremely important. We strongly agree. Here, we supplement a few personal opinions: In the past, regarding the source of rice, although the individual quantities sold by farmers who brought rice to the market were not large, the total amount was quite considerable. From the perspective of allowing free movement to enrich the rice supply, for nearby farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the city for sale, if the quantity is less than one dan (石), the Rice Unified Association should exempt them from purchase and exempt them from obtaining a passport, to ensure smooth flow.</p>
<p>Article 5 of the outline states: "If rice grains are transported without a passport from the Rice Unified Association, it will be considered private rice and punished according to central laws." Article 6 states: "The Rice Unified Association will designate entry points in Beijing and Shanghai for transporting rice, set up temporary passport issuing offices, and may issue transportation passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport at any time." According to Article 5, "If rice grains are transported without a passport from the Rice Unified Association, it will be considered private rice," it should refer to transporting rice without a passport after already passing through the designated entry point. This is because Article 6 already stipulates that designated entry points will issue transportation passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport at any time. The original intention of the two articles is to encourage the source of rice and facilitate its transportation. Therefore, designated entry points will temporarily issue passports and prevent private transportation to evade purchase. However, Article 5 must be clearly explained to avoid abuses. The so-called private rice refers to those who have passed through the entry point without a passport, not that it is private rice when transported to the entry point without a passport. Article 6 states that temporary passports should be issued free of charge in principle; otherwise, in addition to the prescribed official fees, it should be absolutely fair and swift to facilitate transportation. If there are difficulties or delays, anyone is allowed to report it at any time, and the staff involved should be severely punished to prevent corruption. The entry point should be announced so that everyone is aware.</p>
<p>The so-called actual cost is indeed difficult to calculate, especially in a harsh environment where "extortionate taxes and miscellaneous fees are higher than everything else." Secondly, there is often the case of "taking two out of ten" when transporting rice by train, which is one aspect of the problem. Therefore, to make "actual cost" become "actual," the first step is to ban all extortionate taxes and miscellaneous fees, and the second is to eliminate corruption in transportation. We suggest organizing rice escort teams, protected by military police, and then transporting in groups.</p>
<p>The rice management agency should formulate rice management measures as soon as possible and quickly process the rice after it arrives in the urban area. The management measures should pay attention to (1) strictly implementing registration procedures, (2) limiting buying and selling to members of the trade association, but preventing speculation by prohibiting buying and selling between traders with the same qualifications in the same area, and (3) requiring rice to be sold at market price within a prescribed time limit after arriving in Shanghai or entering the warehouse; otherwise, a small penalty should be added, and the Rice Unified Association should purchase it at market price. At the same time, a rice ship pier should be designated when large quantities of rice arrive at the port.</p>
<p>Finally, laws alone cannot enforce themselves. We always believe that a thorough adjustment of personnel issues is an absolute prerequisite. If the personnel of the Rice Unified Association are not first sound, then all measures will only be a formality.</p>

To break the deadlock on the India-Burma front, the Chongqing troops are attempting to stir up trouble behind the Japanese army and implement sabotage operations. 100,000 Vietnamese troops under General Mo Jian Deng, especially those linked to the fortresses of Lang Son, Dong Dang, Ha Cao Lang Ha, and Pei Tan Ke along the Lao Kai line, are on standby, and are closely coordinating with the Japanese army to strengthen the defense of northern Vietnam. Although the Chongqing troops on the northern front of Vietnam do not have the strength to break into Vietnam, the fact that they are gradually increasing their combat power cannot be ignored. The defense of northern Vietnam is currently as solid as a rock. The U.S. military is currently working hard to make the Chongqing troops on the northern front of Vietnam Americanized. Recently, it has sent U.S. instructor groups to these Chongqing troops in Guangxi and Yunnan for training, and has strengthened the equipment of these Chongqing armies with American-style weapons. Due to this situation, Vietnam's defense must start by strengthening the domestic situation.</p>
<p>Vietnam Strengthens Domestic Situation</p>
<p>Therefore, the movement to strengthen the domestic situation in Vietnam is proceeding steadily. Through the strengthening of school education and the expansion of university sports and rural military movements, as well as holding Vietnamese Federal Conferences, etc. In addition, the Vietnamese authorities have recently achieved new success in the re-organization of overseas Chinese, that is, resolving the opposition between Chinese and Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese authorities are taking this opportunity to strengthen the domestic situation in Vietnam, reorganize the tens of thousands of overseas Chinese residing in Vietnam, and impose strict controls on the trade of Vietnamese goods with various places in southern China.</p>
<p>In addition, the most noteworthy aspect of the recent situation in Vietnam is the visit of the new French ambassador to Japan, Gosmer, and the acting ambassador to Thailand, Casian, to Vietnam, and the establishment of a German Gu Zong medical association. The German Gu Zong medical association does not attend in the capacity of governor-general, but presents opinions from the perspective of the French Pacific chief medical officer. The talks between these two parties seem to have reviewed the new East Asian countermeasures of French overseas agencies. The withdrawal of diplomatic officials stationed in Chongqing will lead to extremely subtle French moves that will be recognized by the National Government, which will become clear sooner or later. This point is worthy of attention due to the recent activities of Japanese Ambassador Yoshizawa and Ambassador Gosmer.</p>
<p>Attacking Rabaul Enemy Planes; Nine Shot Down</p>
<p>Tokyo Twenty-eighth Central News Agency, Rabaul Electric: On the 27th, about 180 enemy B25, B24, and P40 aircraft attacked Rabaul. After being engaged by Japanese aircraft, a total of five were shot down and four were destroyed. Japanese losses were very slight.</p>

<p>Tokyo Twenty-eighth Central Army, at the same time, food has also been The head of a certain unit on the front line in the northeast of Japan is making sufficient preliminary efforts to store it, in preparation for a long-term war, with the enemy’s base. Nimitz went crazy and heard that they would attack Japan from the north, and now he has made a statement on this matter, the general idea is as follows: After the destruction of Attu Island, the military strength of the northern Kuril Islands was immediately strengthened. There are now several regiments of land forces in the northern Kuril Islands, and several regiments in the central and southern Kuril Islands, totaling several regiments. There are also facilities such as reinforced concrete bunkers and air-raid shelters, as well as solid mountain rock fortresses, which are extremely strong. Since the arrival of a certain unit commander last year, military preparations have become more vigorous, and there is no fear of an attack by a million enemy troops. There are several airfields for the army, navy, and air force, and a large number of aircraft are on standby. Under the strict surveillance of the Japanese army, if the enemy transports a fleet of ships at a speed of , it will take several hours to reach the coast. Moreover, the enemy ships will never be able to break through the scientifically equipped surveillance network, and all kinds of new weapons deployed on the coast have been test-fired and are ready to defeat the enemy.</p>
<p>The Pacific War Enters its Second Stage</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: Naval commentator Simon recently published an article in the May 21st issue of the British weekly magazine "Picture Post," explaining that the Pacific naval war has entered the stage of battleship fleet warfare. The general idea is as follows: When we are training 3,000 four-engine bombers to attack Japan, we must have a runway extended to 3,600 miles for extended replenishment. And every time the invasion route to Tokyo is reduced by 500 miles, there must be an additional 50 airfields. Regarding climatic relations, attacks from the India-Burma front will not be allowed to continue for more than half a year. Currently, the Burma Road can transport 15,000 tons of military supplies, which is not enough to supply the British army for one month. Therefore, the main point is that, apart from serving as psychological assistance to the Chongqing army, the Burma Road is almost useless in the future war situation. However, when we turn to the Pacific, everything is completely different. In order to ensure its vast sea transportation lines, Japan will likely have a large fleet with powerful battleships as its main force and a large number of submarines. Moreover, German submarines have not been completely cleared from the Atlantic Ocean. The surviving German battleships after the Tirpitz are still attacking powerful Anglo-American fleets in the North Sea. In order to counter the Anglo-American aircraft carrier groups, the Japanese army is building airfields on several islands in the Pacific. From the beginning of the war, Japan realized that this great task would be long-term. The first stage has passed, and it is now building and expanding its occupied territories. In response, the Anglo-American naval strategy is to lure the Japanese fleet out to the open ocean outside the operational circle of base aircraft, based on the experience of the sinking of the Prince of Wales and Repulse in narrow waters. Therefore, future naval battles will necessarily cover the largest ocean in the world and be a major decisive battle for fleets.</p>
<h3 id="e4">During the Luoyang Campaign: The Final Act of Fierce Fighting: Seizing the Northwest Highland Position <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The fiercest battle in the Luoyang campaign was to seize the position on the northwest highlands of Luoyang. For six years, the Chongqing army had used the terrain around the Qinggong Temple on the highlands to build countless anti-tank trenches, concrete bunkers, and special fire points. This area was truly a strategic stronghold with a dangerous and secure location. On the morning of the 19th, the Japanese army issued a general attack order on the highlands, occupied its forward stronghold, Jiang Gou, and created a standoff in Yingzhuang. When they were forced to 200 meters west of Qinggong Temple, the Chongqing army's artillery fire was very fierce, and the Japanese army was blocked and could not advance rapidly. All the officers and soldiers gnashed their teeth and wrung their wrists, extremely. On the 20th, the Central troops specifically broke into the Chongqing army's horseshoe-shaped position, advanced bravely with iron helmets and trenches. The day ended in a stalemate. The next day, the 21st, they continued to increase their forces and actively attack, and bomber squadrons also cooperated with fierce bombings. At 7:00 p.m., the giant artillery positions began to bombard, and then tanks took the lead, rushing straight into the position. At around 8:00 p.m., the position was completely occupied, and the Chongqing army's counterattack was repeatedly repelled that night. At dawn on the 22nd, bombing started the battle, and a fierce battle was launched again. Before dawn, the area around the highlands was completely shrouded in gunpowder smoke. At 9:00 a.m., the Japanese tank team, with fierce artillery fire, broke into the highland in front of Yingzhuang, approaching the Chongqing army's bunkers. The Chongqing army was in chaos, and the Japanese army took the opportunity to break in. At noon, they occupied Yingzhuang and continued to bombard Qinggong Temple. At 9:00 p.m. that night, the Japanese elite troops broke into Qinggong Temple, and thus, from the fortified position in the northwest, the Chongqing army was forced into the defenseless city of Luoyang.</p>
<p>Xinzheng Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The Chongqing side's current Japanese army offensive in Henan has forced British and Americans residing in areas south of the Yellow River to take refuge. Xi'an is also forcibly suppressing Catholicism. The 14 Catholic churches in Zhengzhou, Xinzheng, Wanxian, Jiaxian, Linchi, and other places have completely disappeared and have all been turned into ruins. Foreign teachers have all been taken away, and those involved in Central China have also completely collapsed.</p>
<p>Lushi Chongqing Airfield Destroyed by Japanese Army</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Twenty-eighth Central News Agency: The Japanese army's special service team made great contributions in this Henan operation, especially when destroying the Lushi airfield and other military facilities. Their courageous combat was truly amazing. According to reports, the unit received the order to attack Lushi on the night of May 14th. Lushi is located about 200 kilometers southwest of Luoyang and is a key location connecting the air force bases in Xi'an, Liangshan, and Hanzhong. Recently, it has been further strengthened as an advanced base for the general counter-offensive against Japan. The Japanese army unit set off from near Songxian and began to attack through the natural dangers of the Funiu Mountains, wading through muddy roads. At dawn on the 5th, they arrived at Shenyu Street (20 kilometers southwest of Songxian), suddenly attacked the Chongqing 13th Division, annihilated it, and also annihilated one division of the 20th Army. Taking advantage of the situation, they fiercely pursued the 2,000 Chongqing soldiers of the 177th Division who were fleeing in defeat, launching a fierce guerrilla war in the rain. By the afternoon of the 16th, north of Xiying (40 kilometers west of Songxian), they suddenly attacked and annihilated the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army. Subsequently, on the 18th, they fought with enemy troops who came to try to stop the Japanese army's advance. In this battle, the Japanese killed and captured 534 Chongqing soldiers and occupied Mikou. On the 19th, they urgently crossed the Luo River, forcing the south side of Lushi, crossing a dangerous road about 100 kilometers from Songxian. After receiving the attack order at dawn on the 19th, the warriors of the team enthusiastically surrounded and annihilated part of the Chongqing army. At 5:30 a.m. on the 20th, they occupied Lushi and completely destroyed the runway, warehouses, and other associated facilities of the airfield. At around 11:00 a.m. on the same day, the team began to withdraw after the mission had been completed and had completed the withdrawal by the 20th.</p>

<p>— Miyakei Haruji</p>
<p>The Emergence of D-Class Battleships</p>
<p>Thus, the world's battleships underwent a revolution. At that time, in the 39th year of the Meiji era (1906), Britain built a battleship equipped with ten 12-inch main guns. This warship was the famous "Dreadnought," a pair of 17,900-ton warships, with twelve secondary guns being 12-pounder guns (7.6 cm guns) specifically for repelling surprise attacks from small vessels. The construction of this type of warship was overseen by Baron Fisher, who later became a field marshal. After the successful equipping of the Japanese ships "Satsuma" and "Aki" with ten 10-inch guns, whose caliber was not much different from that of the main guns, it was speculated that replacing the 10-inch guns with 12-inch guns would likely be feasible. At the same time, the method of fighting with an equal number of large-caliber guns usable on either broadside was devised, resulting in this revolutionary design.</p>
<p>The "Dreadnought" had ten 12-inch guns, each pair mounted in a turret, for a total of five turrets. Two of the turrets were positioned on the centerline at the stern, and three at the bow. Of the latter, one turret was on the centerline, while the remaining two were placed on either broadside. Therefore, in a broadside engagement, eight 12-inch guns could fire, while in a bow engagement, six guns could fire, and in a stern engagement, four guns could fire. Moreover, this type of warship was equipped with a 23,400-horsepower steam turbine engine, enabling it to travel at a high speed of 22 knots despite being a battleship, which amazed the world.</p>
<p>Isn't it interesting that even in Britain, voices were raised criticizing that the fleet of about fifty battleships, once boasted as absolutely the best in the world, had become obsolete?</p>
<p>Subsequently, various countries around the world built warships capable of competing with this new type of warship. The Japanese ships "Kawachi" and "Settsu" also belonged to the so-called D-class battleships. Although Japan only built these two ships, other countries desperately built D-class battleships, not wanting to fall behind, thus creating a naval arms race in the world.</p>
<p>Super D-Class Battleships</p>
<p>In this situation, Britain would be caught off guard in the event of war if it did not build even more powerful warships, so it designed and built larger warships equipped with even bigger guns. Because they were far superior to the Dreadnought type, they were called Super Dreadnought-type battleships (also known as Super D-class warships).</p>
<p>Why was Britain so alarmed? Because the appearance of the "Dreadnought" put the emerging German navy on the same starting line. As mentioned earlier, Britain possessed fifty old-fashioned battleships. After seeing the success of the "Dreadnought," Germany immediately imitated it, first building four Nassau-class (18,500 tons) battleships, followed by four Helgoland-class (21,000 tons) battleships. Thus, the naval strength of Britain and Germany gradually converged. Britain's only advantage over Germany was its superior naval power. If the naval strength of the two countries were similar, then Britain, lacking territory on the European continent, would face Germany, the largest power in Europe. If Germany possessed a navy capable of easily defeating the British navy and protecting its passage across the English Channel, then Britain would inevitably be relegated to a third-rate nation. Britain, which created the "Dreadnought," unexpectedly found itself in a position where its maritime power was severely threatened as a result.</p>
<p>Therefore, Britain had no choice but to build Super D-class ships.</p>
<p>The first batch of these Super D-class battleships was the four Orion-class ships completed from 1911 to 1912, each with a displacement of 22,500 tons, ten twin-mounted main guns, and a caliber larger than the D-class's 12-inch guns, at 13.5 inches. They were mounted in five turrets. The arrangement of the turrets was different from that of the D-class battleships, with all of them placed on the centerline, two at the bow, two at the stern, and one in the center. Therefore, in a broadside engagement, all ten main guns could fire. However, in a bow or stern engagement, only four could be fired, which was a drawback, but the overall firepower was far greater than that of the D-class ships. Other countries subsequently followed suit, of course.</p>
<p>What about the situation with destroyers? They had to be larger than torpedo boats. Moreover, they not only served as destroyer escorts, but also achieved greater success as raiding forces. Therefore, they also needed high speed, and because they operated with the fleet and sailed the ocean, they required a considerable size and relatively powerful weapons. Thus, their displacement gradually increased from the 300-ton class during the Russo-Japanese War. For example, in Britain, the G-class (860 tons - 940 tons) was replaced by the H-class (950 tons - 1,003 tons), and the armament was upgraded from four 3-inch guns to four 4-inch guns. As for the hull design, the forecastle deck was raised to enable high-speed navigation even in rough seas, in order to increase their seaworthiness.</p>
<p>Submarines had been conceived long ago, but the idea of not only submerging but also being able to navigate underwater and destroy enemy warships was a more recent development.</p>
<p>In 1775, American David Bushnell built a submersible, in which the occupant propelled it with a hand-cranked propeller, submerged underwater, and attached a timed bomb to the bottom of enemy ships. During the American Revolutionary War, an attempt was made to use it to blow up British ships, but it was unsuccessful. Subsequently, Robert Fulton, who rose to fame by inventing the steamboat, also had the same idea. Two years after Bushnell, he built a cigar-shaped submarine called the "Nautilus." It could carry two crew members, propelled by a hand-cranked propeller, and sailed on the surface with sails. Napoleon was delighted to see it and conducted various experiments, planning to use it in actual warfare, but he never had the opportunity, and Napoleon was soon defeated.

<h3 id="e13">Plans to Establish a Vagrant Labor Camp; Seeking Opinions from All Quarters; Mayor Chen and Minister Ding Receive Representatives from Various Sectors Yesterday <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The number of vagrants, beggars, hoodlums, and ruffians in this city surpasses that of the entire nation, harming the city's image, disrupting public order, disturbing travelers, merchants, and public welfare to a great extent. Not only do all sectors of this city eagerly hope that the authorities will adopt appropriate measures to alleviate the suffering of the people, but the authorities are also keen on planning and eliminating this problem. The Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government attach great importance to this issue, and after accepting requests from various sectors, they specifically convened a meeting to proceed with the establishment of the "Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp." This camp will be dedicated to the accommodation of vagrants, beggars, hoodlums, and ruffians, providing them with moral education and compulsory agricultural labor. This will contribute to assisting production, improving public order, beautifying the city's appearance, and promoting public welfare. Mayor Chen and Minister of Social Welfare Ding specifically hosted leaders from all sectors of the city at the Hua Garden Club yesterday (the 28th) during the holiday, seeking their opinions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mayor Chen was unable to attend due to official duties and sent Secretary-General Wu as his representative. Other attendees included: Minister Ding, Director of the Security Office Xiong, Director of Preparations for the Vagrant Labor Camp Zhou Minying, Director of the Public Welfare Administration of the Ministry of Social Welfare Zhang Kechang, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun, Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office Chen Dongbai, Director of the Second Police Bureau Chu Ying, and no less than sixty other individuals, including Li Sihao, Kang Hou, Yuan Ludeng, Wu Yizhi, Luo Hongyi, Zhou Zuomin, Xu, Shao Shijun, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu, Ding Jiwan, and Chen Binsu. Minister Ding provided a detailed explanation of the motives and objectives for establishing the vagrant labor camp and his hopes for the future. Secretary-General Wu then delivered a speech, expressing his deep hope for the united assistance of local forces. Subsequently, leaders from various sectors, including Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, expressed their insightful opinions, all of which expressed strong agreement. It was then decided that the fundraising goal would be 20 million yuan, with a deadline of June 15th. Designated donation collection points included banks such as Continental, Jin Cheng, Siming, China, Communications, Shanghai, Yu, and Lianyi, as well as money shops such as Run Run, Fuyuan, and Tailai, and major newspapers such as Xinwen Bao, Zhonghua Shibao, Xin Zhongguo Bao, Ping Bao, Guomin Xinwen, and Shen Bao. The planned location is near North Xin, where temporary thatched shacks will be built. Before the completion of the construction, work will begin in the Nanshi area. It is understood that this initiative will be carried out under the principle of unified official and public efforts. To actively proceed with the preparations, a specific date of June 3rd has been set for the first board meeting.</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Minister of Social Welfare Ding said in his speech, roughly: "Today, we gather to discuss the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. I am deeply grateful for your presence. In the past, there were very few organizations that accommodated vagrants. Only the Vagrant Work Training Center, led by Mr. Li Sihao, achieved significant results. Other efforts were unable to accommodate large numbers of people. Although the government has handled some cases in the past, the scale has not yet been perfected. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Welfare, in conjunction with the Municipal Government, has established this initiative, with slight differences in its name, method, and work content. In the past, the emphasis was on handicrafts, but now the focus is on agriculture. Our country has a large amount of vacant and wasteland, lacking people to cultivate and care for it, resulting in insufficient production and a serious impact on rice and grain supplies. Our country, which has always been an agricultural nation, is suffering from insufficient production. In order to assist in increasing production, we have decided to focus on agricultural labor. Handicraft labor is ultimately limited by various difficulties such as raw materials, electricity, and sales channels. Therefore, promoting agricultural labor not only helps to increase production but can also be gradually expanded. The plan we have formulated this time is applicable to all parts of the country, starting with Shanghai. Vagrants can be found everywhere, and large amounts of barren mountains and wastelands can be utilized. We are starting with Shanghai in the hope of generating interest in other places and encouraging them to promote it. We attach particular importance to this and deeply hope that under the leadership of the government, with the enthusiastic assistance of celebrities from all walks of life, we can contribute to the cause of loving the country and saving the nation by starting from small things. Therefore, I firmly believe that today's policy will assist in increasing production, and will also be beneficial to public order and public welfare. Regarding local public order, the traces of undesirable elements are also related to the ability to improve welfare. Even after the detention of petty criminals, we must also consider their living problems after their release. The hidden evils of hoodlums and ruffians in Shanghai have caused deep harm and have accumulated for decades. I have now made a firm decision to eliminate this. Therefore, the work of the vagrant labor camp is indispensable. In addition, various parties have already sponsored the source of regular expenses, but the fundraising for start-up costs is also quite expensive, such as housing, uniforms, and agricultural tools. I deeply hope that all parties will work hard to assist, contribute money or effort, and fundraise on behalf of all parties, in order to promote early success. I believe that all those who are enthusiastic about the local area will definitely be willing to help."</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Wu said in his speech, roughly: "Today, I am here on behalf of Mayor Chen. Minister Ding has already explained the significance and motives of the vagrant labor camp in great detail, and has also expressed his hopes and aspirations. I will now add a few points. Shanghai has a great deal of assistance from women, but it is mostly focused on charitable hearts, providing clothing and porridge to beggars, with the motivation of creating blessings for their descendants. Under this idea of accumulating virtue, the foundation of social order is stabilized. The establishment of the vagrant labor camp is a preparatory work. Fortunately, with everyone's appeal, all parties will definitely be willing to assist. Minister Ding just described the darkness of the wharf gangs, and I also deeply agree. Shanghai's vagrants are divided into organized and unorganized groups. If they are unified into an organization, it will be very difficult to eliminate them. Generally, unemployed strong men are most likely to go down this path. There are also quite a few children. A deceased friend once told me that there are no fewer than 30,000 such children, and they are all organized, repeatedly instigated by adults to commit illegal acts. I hope that after the establishment of the vagrant labor camp, not only will adults be accommodated, but attention will also be paid to stray children. Although they lack ability in production, their development in the future may be even more advanced than that of adult vagrants. Therefore, the future work should focus on agriculture, and it is best to achieve self-sufficiency. A portion of the land should be designated for planting vegetables and grains, so that vagrants can have a place to belong and rely on to support themselves. I also hope that everyone will express their opinions."</p>
<p>Opinions from All Parties</p>
<p>Mr. Li Sihao first described the process of the Red Cross Society's establishment of the vagrant work training center, as well as the official supervision and assistance. He also explained the advantages of official management in accommodating vagrants, and that vagrants are generally more likely to comply. Finally, he expressed his hope that in addition to accommodating adults, attention should be paid to accommodating children, and that everyone should take responsibility and work hard for the vagrant labor camp to achieve early success. Mr. Lin Kanghou said, roughly: "The launch of the vagrant labor camp is a blessing for Shanghai. Today, Shanghai's society is gradually degenerating, and I am deeply concerned. Since the establishment of the Inquiry Committee by the Municipal Government, I have advocated for public order and providing a place for the unemployed. Now, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Municipal Government, for the sake of Shanghai's future, I feel very pleased. Since returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong, I have been focused on the work of educating and raising children, because the country's future depends on children. With the strong support of Mr. Li Sihao, I have witnessed stray children everywhere. Looking forward to the future of society, it is unimaginable and there is no way to protect public order. The official launch of this initiative is a great blessing for Shanghai. I hope that it will be widely publicized and promoted to success. Regarding fundraising, it may be better to fundraise separately, as this will yield better results. I deeply hope that the local community will take responsibility and assist in its success. In addition to accommodating beggar children, I also hope that stray women, i.e., prostitutes on the street, will also be accommodated, as they are no different from poisonous snakes and ferocious beasts, in order to save the lower classes. I deeply hope that everyone present will jointly study this issue, raise funds, and wish for its rapid establishment." Mr. Yuan Ludeng's opinion was to adopt a gradual approach to eliminating vagrants, so that they would disappear completely. Regarding fundraising methods, he deeply hoped that everyone would take responsibility to assist the government in this work.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Central Government to Manage Major Material Controls; Commercial Control Committee to Undertake Supervision <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the reorganization of the National Commercial Control Committee, it is understood that the relevant bureaus have been studying and consulting to determine a plan. It is expected that the plan will be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion and decision in the shortest possible time, and then announced for implementation. According to sources from relevant parties, the reorganization of the Commercial Control Committee in the future will strengthen the major tasks of independent control of key items in various industries outside the Commercial Control Committee. The administrative control of essential food and consumer goods such as rice and grains, wheat flour, cotton industry, miscellaneous grains, cooking oil, and sugar industry will be directly under the Executive Yuan. The Commercial Control Committee will be responsible for supervising, guiding, and reviewing various material control tasks.</p>

<p>In order to ensure the health of citizens given the recent hot weather, the Municipal Health Bureau has specifically decided to launch a cleanup on the first day of next month to promote awareness among citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Heads of Households Can Collect West Shanghai New Residence Permits on Behalf of Residents <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since the authorities adjusted the issuance of residence permits in West Shanghai on the 10th of last month, it has become more convenient than before. Citizens who have already registered their fingerprints do not need to go to the bureau in person to collect their new permits next time. They only need to give their old citizen permits and collection receipts to the head of the household, who can take the household registration form to the bureau to collect the permits. As for those who have lost their collection receipts or have arrived in Shanghai from other places with movement permits, they can obtain an application form from the authorities, which can be issued after the head of the household, the Neighborhood Chief, and the Borough Chief have stamped their seals on it.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Police Officers Not Allowed to Leave Their Posts During the Alert Period; In order to maintain local public order and strengthen police force, the Second Police Bureau of this city specifically issued an order to its subordinate branch bureaus and district police bureaus, as well as the Inspector General's Corps and Detective Units, stating that from now on, during the implementation of the alert period, all officers and personnel of the bureau and units are not allowed to leave their posts easily, in order to emphasize their duties and implement the spirit of tireless police work, so that they can fully respond to any emergencies that may occur. The Fifth Phase of Special Flour Adjustment for Rationing; Flour Purchase Certificates to Be Issued Starting Today; The Shanghai District Flour and Bran Rationing Office has been distributing special flour rations to various industries such as noodle shops on schedule. The flour purchase certificates for the fifth phase of special flour rationing have now been set to be issued starting today (the 29th). On June 4th, members of various industries can use the flour purchase certificates to collect flour from designated distribution points. The price is 440 yuan per bag, with no additional fees. If anyone encounters false fee collection, they can report it to the Rationing Office at any time. According to information obtained from the office, the fifth phase of special flour rationing has been further improved, and the quantity of rations for various industries has also been readjusted. The office will conduct detailed reviews of whether the business operations of various industries are related to essential noodle products and whether members are receiving duplicate flour rations, and determine the quantity of flour to be rationed based on actual needs. In this round, more than 100 members of various industries who received flour rations were found to be unqualified after strict investigation by the Rationing Office, and their rations have been suspended. In addition, the Noodle and Food Industry Guild has been temporarily suspended from rationing because its members are mixed and the definition of its business is too broad. Rations will be reissued after the guild has conducted a clear investigation and reported it for verification. The quantities of flour distributed to members of the other nine guilds, such as noodle shops, are as follows: Mechanized noodle shops will receive 7 bags of flour per household, pastry shops will receive 4 bags of flour per household, biscuit and fried dough twist shops will receive 7 bags of flour per household, noodle shops will receive 6 bags of flour per household (referring to shops that specialize in selling plain noodles and wontons), restaurants will receive 3 bags of flour per household, dim sum shops will receive 4 bags of flour per household, teahouses will receive 4 bags of flour per household, congee shops will receive 3 bags of flour per household, and canned food industries will be divided into four levels: large, medium, small, and extra-small. Large businesses will receive 22 bags of flour per household, medium businesses will receive 16 bags of flour per household, small businesses will receive 6 bags of flour per household, and extra-small businesses will receive 2 bags of flour per household. A total of 7,194 bags of flour will be distributed to 1,045 households in nine industries (all are second-grade flour). Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition; Last Day; The Second Ancient and Modern Painting Exhibition, co-sponsored by this newspaper and the Continental News, is being held publicly on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel. It features more than 200 famous paintings from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties to modern times, many of which are rare masterpieces on the market. Yesterday (the 28th) was the third day, and thousands of visitors from all walks of life attended, as it was Sunday. Lieutenant General Kawamoto, the Minister of the Army of Japan, also visited. Today (the 29th) is the last day, and all are welcome to visit. Barber Shops in this City Suddenly Implement Price Increases Again; Barber shops in this city have recently and automatically implemented price increases again. It is said that the reason is due to the authorities' restrictions on water and electricity supply. However, according to this reporter's investigation, the guild had already instructed all shops not to use unnecessary equipment such as "hair dryers" in order to cope with the current situation. Therefore, the price increase in each store is actually only a false statement based on water and electricity restrictions. Short Commentary: Supporting the Vagrant Labor Camp; Mayor Chen and Minister Ding hosted representatives from all walks of life yesterday to solicit opinions and seek cooperation on the establishment of the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp. It is said that attendees donated and pledged enthusiastically, expressing strong support. For example, Mr. Wang Yizhi pledged 200,000 yuan, and Messrs. Luo Hongyi, Xu Changchuan, and Zhang Ruitang jointly pledged 200,000 yuan, which is commendable. Regarding the issue of resettlement of vagrants in this city, this newspaper proposed a suggestion in an editorial on April 27th, stating that the way to provide relief to vagrants is not passive accommodation, but to actively enable them to produce and support themselves. The responsibility for relief should be led by the government and assisted by society. It is very gratifying that the authorities are now actively working to promote this. There are two more points that can be mentioned in passing. To rectify the city's appearance, stray children on the streets must also be accommodated, but it is not easy to thoroughly accommodate stray children without first accommodating vagrants, because vagrants are also organized, and many stray children are under their command. Therefore, accommodating vagrants is a fundamental solution. Giving money to able-bodied vagrants who beg along the road, strictly speaking, does not show compassion, but actually cultivates their dependency habits, as the saying goes, "If you beg for three years, you will have no intention of becoming an official." Therefore, it is hoped that the ladies will donate the money they give away to accommodation institutions, so that these people have nothing to rely on. The authorities are now planning to establish a vagrant labor camp, and have secured some funds for regular expenses. They are raising 20 million yuan from all sectors of society for start-up costs, and it is hoped that citizens will jointly assist in donating. This newspaper has accepted the commission to fundraise for a portion of the start-up costs, amounting to 1 million yuan. In addition to this newspaper donating 50,000 yuan to show its leadership, we hope that readers will cherish social welfare and donate generously. The list of donors will be published successively starting from this Thursday. The Thrift Association Broadcast Yesterday; The Shanghai Special City Thrift Association held its 15th regular broadcast yesterday. Ren Yunpeng, a director and secretary-general of the association, gave a speech at the Shanghai Electric Joint Stock Company, entitled "My Views on Saving Electricity," which was concise and profound, and could serve as a lesson for the power company.

Dr. Gu Nandian was elected as chairman. The meeting began at 3:00 p.m. After the opening remarks by the chairman and the speech by the director of the Health Bureau, the meeting reported on the progress of association affairs and discussed several important proposals, such as revising the association's constitution and issuing publications. News in Brief; A Grand Opening of Pu Songchuang's Painting Exhibition; Pu Songchuang, the Director of the Art Department of Beijing Furen University, has come south for the first time, bringing more than 200 of his new and old masterpieces to hold a painting exhibition at the YMCA. His female disciples, Shen Gui and Hui Youhe, are also exhibiting their works. In recent years, few painters from the north have come south, so the visitors are very enthusiastic. Tianjin United Football Team's Competition Schedule in Shanghai; Shanghai Football Association Welcomed the Team Yesterday; The Shanghai Football Association held a grand welcome meeting at the Portuguese General Chamber of Commerce yesterday morning at 11:00 a.m. to welcome the Tianjin United Football Team to Shanghai.
