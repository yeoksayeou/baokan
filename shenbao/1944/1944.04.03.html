<h2>Page 1</h2>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>決心吃苦</h3>
<p>戰爭時期後方人民的吃苦，原是本分。吃苦的反面是享樂，享樂必須增加物力的消耗。因為國民多一分消耗，國家就少一分積儲，也就是減少一分戰力，所以國民的吃苦，間接就是增加國家的戰力，而可早日促進勝利的獲得。</p>
<p>吃苦可以救國，不但戰時如此，平時亦然。最明顯的例就是蘇聯，三個五年計劃的成功就是吃苦兩字。那時蘇聯的口號是「吃得少，穿得少，住得少，把多的材料去換外國的生產機器」「吃得壞，穿得壤，住得壞，把好的材料去換外國的生產機器」。這種吃苦精神終究造成現代的蘇聯。就說我們中國，數千年來，以農立國，農民們，食不果腹，衣不蔽體，日出而作，日入而息，過的</p>
<p>戰爭時期國民的吃苦不但是「理所當然」，並且是「勢所必至」。我們讀上次歐戰史，就知道參戰國家的吃苦情况。那時候，美國算最富有的，可是當美國參戰之後一九一七年七月七日頒佈的經濟章程，已經規定國民每星期遵守一無麥日（即禁食麵包），並規定每星期至多食肉一次。其他各國國民一切節約消費，決心吃苦的事，更是不勝枚舉。因為戰爭時期，一切都為戰爭，國家的物力更須全部提供作戰需要，把後方國民的物力，充實前方將士的戰力，是獲得勝利的</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是解放戰，是大東亞民族的生死關頭。盟邦日本最先表現吃苦精神。日本國內的國民，吃得少，吃得壞，穿得少，穿得壞，到過日本的都看見。日本的資源還足够供給國民美衣美食，但是政府不願意這樣做，國民也不願意這樣做，他們願意茹風含苦，儲藏國力，促進戰爭的勝利，以求將來永久的安樂。這是戰時體制的模範，是我們所應當效法的好榜樣。</p>
<p>中國原是一個勤儉的國家，但是自從鴉片戰爭歐美資本勢力侵入以後，都市中的人民，漸漸走上奢侈的路，特別在上海，過去英美人憑藉租界的勢力，以剝削中國人的所得，享用豪華，達官巨賈更追隨其後，奢侈辛氣的造成，這是最大的原因。要知道英美人所化用的是剝削所得的利益，中國人所化用的乃是國民的民脂民膏。這個奢侈的風氣使中國出超增加，使中國貧乏。假如沒有這次大東亞戰爭，那末英美的經濟侵略可使中國不能翻身。解放的時間到了，如果我們還是驕奢淫佚，那末將來的結果也就不堪設想，民族國家完了，個人當然同歸於盡。在這個緊要關頭，只有下極大的決心，過最苦的生活，勿貪舒服，勿想浪費，時時熬苦，事事克己，替國家保留元氣，就是替自己留一個將來安樂的餘地。</p>
<h3>日印軍節節推進完成總攻擊態勢　烏克魯爾附近敵完全殲滅</h3>
<p>仰光二日中央社電東部印緬國境某地一日電：印緬國境日印軍於上月廿八日夜遮斷通結伊姆法爾與哥希馬之敵軍兵站綫後，其有力部隊復於廿九日繼續攻至該公路，即將敵第四軍團之生侖綫澈底破壞，同時由背後扼制敵根據地伊姆法爾，而確立總攻擊態勢，緣日軍於廿八日以挺身為先鋒在岑休方面遮斷哥希馬公路以後，復於廿九日由另一路有力部隊佔領伊姆法爾北方卅公里之地點。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電印度前綫日軍某基地二日電日印軍部隊於赫馬林西南地區渡過更的宛河後，仍繼續西進，於廿一日即抵伊姆法爾東北方之要衝烏克魯爾附近，自廿二日迄廿六日五日問晝夜激戰後，已將該方面之敵完全殲減，現仍繼續向伊姆法爾北方進擊中。敵為挽回頒勢，乃自後方出動第五十旅幽等部隊約三千人開始進擊，但此等部隊於鳥克　爾，羣加鳥克克　爾西南十公里薩雷亥鳥古魯爾西南二十公里附近復潰滅，是役所獲戰果頗大。</p>
<h3>北緬那密敵機塲遭日機猛烈轟炸</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電據緬甸某基地電：緬甸北部敵空輸　進部隊，雖受敵軍充分之補助，以期增强實力，然仍不斷被日印軍隨時予以殲滅。二十八日轟炸戰鬥運合大編隊，曾襲擊馬鳥爾西北方十五公里那密地區敵建造中之滑翔機部隊之降落塲，　敵方激烈之防空部火對之猛炸，而將其降落塲炸破，並擊毀其滑翔機五架，日機安返基地。</p>
<p>又訊：日陸軍機隊為呼應日軍地上都隊急追敗敵，曾於二十八日大舉空襲加魯谿圈，另一隊則轟炸在達姆至伊姆法爾公路上敗走之敵軍予以重創。</p>
<h3>比巴山脈被包圍敵主力陷於潰亂</h3>
<p>仰光二日中央社電緬甸國境南部某地二日電：敵西非第八十七團主力入千人，盤據於加拉頓河與比河中間地區，復企圖反擊，日印軍部隊察知其企圖後，突於三十日拂曉先發制人，對之加以猛攻，致敵復陷於潰亂狀態而開始退卻，即京格里海岸之敵二千名，於三十日傍晚即已開始於沿比巴山脈經巴雷特瓦之公路逃走，印軍為一舉對之殲潰，已將比巴山脈包圍。</p>
<h3>緬甸決傾全力　從事解放戰爭　巴莫向世界廣播</h3>
<p>仰光一日中央社電緬甸國家代表巴莫，三十一日向世界廣播，力言此次日印軍進攻印度，在歷史上實含有重大意義。並指出美英奪回緬甸之舉，於新興亞洲團結之前將被粉碎。東亞於新的理想下，將更鞏固團結。茲甚其大意如次。現在緬甸戰綫已展開熾烈之攻勢作戰，進展極為順利。</p>
<h3>東亞民族全部動員</h3>
<p>順知此次戰爭乃亞　洲民衆之解放戰爭，為全亞民衆而戰之戰爭，其規模尤大，為澈底實行對亞洲共同敵人之鬥爭，亞洲之一切力量今已整個開始動員。茲余觀察此進攻作戰，首就軍事觀點而言，敵方已完全失敗，並發生內訌、吾人為解放吾人自身，刻正作生死存亡之决戰，然英國戰爭政策依然毫無變化，僅以其他民族之生命財產勞力戰爭而已，敵英以渝印及非洲軍隊與美國之武器，欲作防禦印度之窟大掠奪。其次則為印國民軍之進攻印度，實可謂歷史上壯舉。</p>
<h3>印人奮起拯祖國</h3>
<p>歷數世代敗戰於英國武力下之印人及吾緬人，早已深切諒解此事件之所以然，現在之事件實為萬事終局之開端，確信全印人民必知現在印軍已攻入祖國，已為印度民衆而戰。所謂印度民族主義與印度之反英惡感，一旦時機到來，則必能收獲莫大效果。印國民軍進攻印領，已證明此種時機業已到來。印度幅員　關，地位重要，故印度不鳴則已，鳴必驚人，其對人種差別之反抗，不僅為全東亞民衆之反抗，實全人類一致對敵方不人道世界秩序之偉大反抗。此種全人類之反抗，乃敵英美於此次大戰中必須領略，且為最怕領略之武器，比較彼等物費武器等任何物均有力量而且可怕。</p>
<h3>軍民合一實力雄厚</h3>
<p>試一　蒸蒸日上之緬甸方面之攻勢，可發見一重大事實，即行動一致團結堅固之新亞洲姿能是也。刻下緬甸戰棧正有三個獨立國家之軍隊，於緊張激烈之狀况下協力作戰，此種團結實基於海枯石爛寸心不移之堅决信念，此種信念殆為决定大東亞戰爭各力量之一。尤有甚者，此三軍背後更有一枝實力雄厚之大軍，即緬甸　全國民衆。吾人　力戰爭之努力，刻正於硝煙迷漫之加撒地區發揮其偉大作用，敵軍空中運輸部隊自始即因緬人之英勇抵抗，而遭受重大打擊，此不過其一例而已。</p>
<h3>敵方宣傳心勞日拙</h3>
<p>實甸緬　無時無地不如此，敵軍正為其自方之宣傳所欺，但此等宣傳，徒招致吾人之識　與輕蔑，緬人之鐵石心肝，決不能為其所動也。敵軍之侵入日溪，刻一變而為日軍將攻入伊姆法爾矣，此乃眞確無比之事實，緬甸正有新生之民族，日夜作蓬勃之發展，雖然戰事尙未終結，此後仍須奮鬥，吾人無論受任何犧牲，亦必須使大業完成。吾人具有為求達到目的，不顧任何犧牲之精神，在此次戰爭中，吾人正向最高目標傾注全力蹶起奮鬥。</p>
<h3>緬甸空戰的新情勢</h3>
<p>英美的　心，企圖奪回緬甸後，獲得儲空權而重開援蔣路，因而緬印航空决戰愈演愈烈。雙方均同在強化防空陣容。今日空戰的狀態，常在欲超過對方的防空手段之絕對要求下，逐漸向高空飛行，夜間飛行二分野開拓，而在時間上，空間上有新的飛躍。極高空以至成層圈內的空中戰，業已成為現實的間題，夜間空襲的諸困難，也即將克服。</p>
<p>去年一二月時，在印度航空擊滅戰中，向日駐　陸軍挑戰的旋風式飛機，當初不過二三千米的高度，後來到五是六千米。三月起，高度一天一天增加，至四·五月左右，竟突過八千米的高度，前來反攻·就飛機，尤以戰鬥機而言，高度就是速度，就是威力，比敵人高的時候，除可以用編隊來統制攻擊，並可以一擊而決斷負外，且容易實施分散迫擊，反之，如較敵人為低的塲合，則先須逈　敵人的攻擊以挽回不利的地位，否則就不能獲得戰鬥的指導性。</p>
<h3>高空戰的努力</h3>
<p>因而雙方對於高空戰都非常闊心與努力互相競爭高度。去年雨季以後的空戰，與雨季前大不相同，英國整備最新型的高空性能的優秀機以代替舊旋風式機，美國則增強P51型機。自去年未在阿拉千戰綫上的幾次空戰，及在加爾各答，頓斯基阿及其他航空進攻作戰上；雙方戰鬥機的機鬥，大多在八千至九千米的高度。固然，此在具有優秀航空性能與駕駛者的日本隼型戰鬥機，自然不足為敵，但其高度的航空性能，殊難輕侮。除開高射砲的威脅不說，因為戰鬥機的高空性能發在至此地步，故轟炸機的轟炸高度也跟着增加。例如美國統一式B24型的轟炸，與去年雨季前比較起來，通常總在一千至三千米的高度。在白晝侵入仰光上空的康泰里型等，其　體雖極巨大，但其飛行的高度，即戰鬥機中亦為僅見。</p>
<p>據傳有超重轟炸機B29型（波音）者；敵曾誇稱之成層圈轟炸機，業已出現。空襲高度日見增高。偵察機的高度，與速度同為雙方所最關心者。如英國的蚊子型等，已在九千至一萬米的高度，侵入仰光地區。</p>
<p>這樣，緬鑡戰綫的航空决戰，今已突入高空决戰的階段，成為獲得勝利切實的要求之一</p>
<h3>敵方側重夜襲</h3>
<p>其次可注目者，　近敵機的來襲，以夜間為主。去年雨季過去後呼號從空中反攻緬甸的敵人，果然從十月至十一月逐漸進行大規模的緬甸空襲，每次都因日方防備嚴密而受極大損書。十二月一日，統式B24型　轟炸機十數架，在掩護的P51型戰鬥機，在仰光上空盡被擊落，自此以後，轟炸機的白盡出擊，乃告中止。敵人見白晝日方防衛周密，乃變計於夜間前來襲擊企圖完成目的。規模頗小，每次來襲的機數不過十數架。但其企圖與其戰衛，使日方在夜間空襲上，攻守均不能不加以更大的注意。</p>
<p>在晚間，因航行的困難，與目標的尋覓及攻擊方法的不便，有種種自然的約束，但這些約來對於防守者亦然。且反過來說，這在晚間航行的諸困難，使難於反攻，這一點，在敵很的空襲上，成為絕好的條件。天氣測候與無綫電航行的發達，及照明與福準器具發達的今日，如其經過嚴密的訓練。夜間也許可以發揮　過白晝的威力。（翔。譯自三月十八日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>華北華中間取消　特別圓制度</h3>
<p>北京一日中央社電華北華中間特別圓决算制度，自民國三十年七月資產凍　後實施以來，即於兩地間之交易决算，發揮特殊機能，去年以來，因軍票停止發行新鈔，設定華北華中間之中儲券匯兌等通貨决算制度，逐漸整備，兩地間已無存續特別圓決算制度之必要，故兩地間之特別圓制度，已於三月三十一日取消，自四月一日起兩地間決算，決定為中儲劵匯兌一種，此事業由中國聯合銀行當局正式發表。</p>
<h3>淮海鐵道電台　舉行移交式</h3>
<p>徐州一日中央社電華中華北兩鐵道公司，前會商定，並呈準當局，將津浦路自三舖江南一段，移交華中鐵道公司管理，於四月一日起實行。是日下午四時在徐州津浦馬路鐵路會館舉行移交儀式，華中鐵道公司浦口管理局並在徐設立出張所，所長一職由伊藤榮一擔任。一又電）徐州廣播電台原屬華北廣播協會管理，於一日上午在徐州戶部山該台舉行移交儀式，由中國廣播協會總務部長齊　　郞，及華北廣播協會技衛部長久米正雄主持。（又電）淮海省合作事業，本由華北合作事業總會管轄辦理，茲自本月一日起，所有淮海省所轄廿一縣合作事業，均移歸行政院合作事業委員會　　辦理，定名為淮海省合作社總社各縣設分社。上月卅一日上午在省府大禮堂舉行移交典禮。</p>
<h3>滿鐵取消　各線臥車</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電値此大東亞戰爭步入决勝階段，鐵這運輸所担負之使侖亦愈形重大，華中鐵道公司前為加強物資交流，曾限制旅客攜帶行李，盟邦日本滿洲國亦採最同樣措置。茲自四月一日超為謀運輸力更大之　據，特規定取消各綫臥車，並京釜　數量減少。聞此舉實施後。惟物資可大量運輸，而旅客乘最亦可增加，運輸力有增至現時三倍之可能。</p>
<h3>粵印僑舉行　印度人大會</h3>
<p>廣州一日中央社電印度國民軍高揚獨立三色旗　踏入祖國境內之消息</p>
<h3>鄂合作聯合社　改全省總社</h3>

<h3>節約會張理事長　昨晚廣播</h3>
<p>「醫藥的節約」</p>
<p>上海特別市節約協會，每週定期廣播，昨日下午七時四十分，仍假上海電台舉行，特由該會張理事長於百忙中躬親蒞臨主講，題為「醫藥的節約」，茲誌其廣播詞要點如次</p>
<p>减少疾病節約醫藥</p>
<p>「人生除衣食住行四大要素，需要節約外，尙有醫藥上須節約，蓋衣食住行之支出，尙可預算，而醫藥一項則否。諺云：人有且夕禍福，幫支出多寡，實雖預料，而其消耗，亦未可限量。目下醫藥價格甚昻，一生難保無疾病，醫藥節約，實有必要，是故需力求不生病，儘可能減少疾病，至於減少疾病，方法頗多，以注意日常生活最為重要，食物適可而止，衣不必講究其好，寒則添衣，熱則減服，早起早眠，時常鍛鍊體魄，則疾病自能減少，重者變輕，大病化小病，萬一染疾，內心不可恐怖，力求鎭靜，如過分慌張，延醫服藥，損失不貲，則小病變大，輕病轉重。</p>
<p>濫服補藥無裨實際</p>
<p>最後勸市民勿濫服補藥，吾人輒見服補藥者，反食少人懶，補藥僅有補與生理之一部份，但無補於實際，况僵格昻貴，儘可節省，依目下服補藥而言，在富者固屬浪費，貧者更影響牛活。或有人以為如此則藥房將虧本，醫生無生意，但吾人願意如此，並願同胞注意健康，節省醫藥費用，鍛鍊東亞强健之民族云</p>

<h3>貢獻於獻機運動委員會</h3>
<p>上海巿民衆獻機運動委員會，自從發動工作以來，宣傳推進，不遣餘力，很可欽佩。</p>
<p>關於獻機運動的意義，已為市民大家所瞭然，不再解釋。不過，我們期待這一運動的得到更圓滿結果，略　管見：</p>
<p>記得在民二十六年以前，當時政府也曾發動類似的運動，也曾得到人民廣大的響應。可是，結果因為經辦機關的人事不健全，捐款的數目與用途，未曾公開，引起一般的物議。我們希望這次辦理當局，特別注意此點，將各種捐款籌款的數目，各種開支，保管方法，隨時公佈，如義演京劇及音樂食等，以示大信。我們認為公佈收支，不但昭示信用，同時，由此宜掦捐助者的義舉，捐助者的熱烈情緖，從而喚起社會普遍認職。深信主管當局必能採納斯意。</p>

<h3>金融工商業　市况穩定</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商市况上通間步趨穩定狀態，粭赤槃旋不動，拆息始終未更，股票由跌中轉見步升，銀根雖仍形緊張，正當工商需要，中儲銀行儘量供給，是以金融人士運用資金，異常圓活。上週間投機商活動造成聯鈔與中儒券比率相差之黑市，經中儒指定十一家中日商業銀行辦理華北聯鈔匯兌鈔黑市已見逐漸消滅。至於工商各業因當局儘量供給正當需要，故資金流動活潑，尤其各有關當局防止投機工商人之活動，嚴厲取締囤積居奇，致囤戶不斷拋售囤貨各種日用品批發及零售市價，均漸隆落，故市况已日趨正常云。</p>
<h3>木業公會規定同業經營範圍</h3>
<p>上海特別市木業同業公會，今已正式開始辦公，並嚴格規定同業經營各貨為：　國產建木，　枕不，　廣木，　西本，　甌木，　杭木，　雜樹雜木，及日本歐美各國木材，並製成之中外各種新舊木植板片。</p>

<h3>Determination to Endure Hardship</h3>
<p>During wartime, it is the duty of the people in the rear to endure hardship. The opposite of enduring hardship is seeking pleasure, and seeking pleasure inevitably increases the consumption of resources. Because every extra bit of consumption by the people means a corresponding decrease in the nation's reserves, which in turn reduces its combat power. Therefore, the hardship endured by the people indirectly increases the nation's combat power, leading to an earlier victory.</p>
<p>Enduring hardship can save the nation, not only during wartime but also in peacetime. The most obvious example is the Soviet Union, where the success of its three Five-Year Plans hinged on the spirit of enduring hardship. The slogans of the time were: "Eat less, wear less, live in less, and exchange the surplus materials for foreign production machinery," and "Eat poorly, wear poorly, live poorly, and exchange the good materials for foreign production machinery." This spirit of enduring hardship ultimately created modern Soviet Union. Consider our own China: for thousands of years, we have been an agricultural nation. The peasants, with empty stomachs and inadequate clothing, toiled from sunrise to sunset, living a life of</p>
<p>During wartime, it is not only "right and proper" for the people to endure hardship but also "inevitable." By studying the history of the last European war, we can understand the hardship experienced by the participating nations. Even the United States, the wealthiest nation at the time, enacted economic regulations after entering the war. On July 7, 1917, it stipulated that citizens must observe a "wheatless day" each week (i.e., abstain from bread) and limit meat consumption to once a week. Countless other examples exist of citizens of various countries economizing on consumption and resolving to endure hardship. This is because, during wartime, everything is for the war effort, and the nation's resources must be fully committed to military needs. Replenishing the combat power of the soldiers on the front lines with the resources of the people in the rear is the path to victory.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation, a life-or-death moment for the nations of Greater East Asia. Allied Japan was the first to demonstrate a spirit of enduring hardship. The people of Japan eat less and eat poorly, wear less and wear poorly, as anyone who has visited Japan can attest. Japan has sufficient resources to provide its citizens with fine clothing and food, but the government is unwilling to do so, and the people are unwilling to do so. They are willing to endure hardships, conserve national strength, and promote the victory of the war in order to achieve lasting peace in the future. This is a model wartime system, a good example that we should emulate.</p>
<p>China was originally a frugal nation, but since the Opium War and the intrusion of European and American capitalist forces, the people in the cities have gradually become extravagant. Especially in Shanghai, where in the past, the British and Americans, relying on the power of the concessions, exploited the earnings of the Chinese people to enjoy luxury, the officials and wealthy merchants followed suit, creating a culture of extravagance. The money that the British and Americans spend is the interest from their exploitation, but the money that the Chinese spend is the lifeblood of the nation. This extravagant trend has increased China's trade deficit and impoverished the country. If not for this Greater East Asia War, then the economic aggression of Britain and America would make it impossible for China to recover. The time for liberation has arrived, and if we still indulge in pride, extravagance, and pleasure, then the consequences in the future will be unimaginable. If the nation is finished, then the individual will naturally perish along with it. At this critical moment, we must make a great determination, live the most frugal life, avoid seeking comfort, avoid thinking about waste, constantly endure hardship, be self-disciplined in everything, and conserve the nation's vitality. This is to leave ourselves a margin of comfort in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Indian Troops Advance Steadily, Completing General Attack Posture; Enemy Near Ukhrul Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain location on the Indo-Burmese border in eastern India and Burma on the 1st reports: After the Japanese and Indian troops on the Indo-Burmese border cut off the enemy's supply line connecting Imphal and Kohima on the night of the 28th of last month, their powerful forces continued to advance to the highway on the 29th, thoroughly destroying the enemy's supply line to the 4th Army Corps. At the same time, they controlled the enemy's base in Imphal from the rear, establishing a general attack posture. On the 28th, the Japanese army, with its suicide squads at the vanguard, cut off the Kohima highway in the Tseminyu area, and on the 29th, another powerful force occupied a point 30 kilometers north of Imphal.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Indian front on the 2nd reports: Japanese and Indian troops crossed the Kungdawng River southwest of Homalin and continued to advance westward, reaching the vicinity of Ukhrul, a key point northeast of Imphal, on the 21st. After five days of fierce fighting, day and night, from the 22nd to the 26th, they completely annihilated the enemy in that area and are continuing to advance north towards Imphal. In an attempt to reverse the situation, the enemy dispatched approximately 3,000 troops from the 50th Brigade and other units from the rear to launch an attack, but these troops were defeated again near Ukhrul, Kungai Ukhrul, and Sarai Haree, 20 kilometers southwest of Ukhrul. The results of this battle were quite significant.</p>
<h3>Enemy Airfield at Namyu in Northern Burma Heavily Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in Burma: Although the enemy's airborne troops in northern Burma are receiving ample support from the enemy army in an attempt to increase their strength, they are still being constantly annihilated by Japanese and Indian troops. On the 28th, a large formation of bombers and fighters attacked the landing field of the glider unit being constructed by the enemy in the Namyu area, 15 kilometers northwest of Mawlu. Despite fierce anti-aircraft fire from the enemy, the bombers heavily bombed the landing field, destroying five of the enemy's gliders. The Japanese aircraft returned safely to base.</p>
<p>Another report: In support of the Japanese army's ground forces' rapid pursuit of the defeated enemy, Japanese army aircraft launched a large-scale air raid on Kyaukse on the 28th. Another squadron bombed the enemy troops retreating along the Tamu-Imphal highway, inflicting heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Main Force of the Enemy Surrounded in the Bipa Mountains, Falling into Disarray</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A dispatch from a certain location in southern Burma on the 2nd reports: The main force of the enemy's 87th West African Brigade, approximately 1,000 men, entrenched in the area between the Kaladan River and the Bipa River, attempted to launch a counterattack. Upon learning of their plan, Japanese and Indian troops launched a preemptive strike at dawn on the 30th, causing the enemy to fall into disarray again and begin to retreat. The 2,000 enemy troops at Kyauktan began to flee along the highway through the Bipa Mountains via Paletwa on the evening of the 30th. In order to annihilate them in one fell swoop, the Indian army has surrounded the Bipa Mountains.</p>
<h3>Burma Determines to Exert All Efforts to Engage in the War of Liberation; Ba Maw Broadcasts to the World</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The head of state of Burma, Ba Maw, broadcast to the world on the 31st, strongly stating that the current Japanese and Indian military advance into India has great significance in history. He also pointed out that the Anglo-American attempt to retake Burma will be crushed before the solidarity of the emerging Asia. East Asia will be further consolidated and united under new ideals. The main points are as follows: At present, the Burmese front has launched a fierce offensive operation, which is progressing very smoothly.</p>
<h3>Complete Mobilization of East Asian Peoples</h3>
<p>It is well known that this war is a war of liberation for the people of Asia, a war fought for all the people of Asia. Its scale is even greater, and in order to thoroughly implement the struggle against the common enemy of Asia, all the forces of Asia have now begun to mobilize as a whole. Now, as I observe this offensive operation, first, from a military point of view, the enemy has completely failed and internal strife has occurred. We are now engaged in a life-and-death battle to liberate ourselves, but the British war policy remains unchanged, merely using the lives, property, and labor of other nations to fight the war. The enemy, Britain, is using Indian and African troops and American weapons to defend India, a great plunder. Second, the Indian National Army's advance into India can be called a historical feat.</p>
<h3>Indians Rise Up to Save Their Motherland</h3>
<p>The Indians and our Burmese, who have been defeated by British military force for generations, have long understood the reason for this. The current events are the beginning of the end of all things. We are convinced that all the people of India must know that the Indian army has now entered their motherland and is fighting for the people of India. The so-called Indian nationalism and anti-British sentiment in India will surely reap great results when the opportunity arises. The Indian National Army's advance into Indian territory has proved that this opportunity has already arrived. India is vast and important, so if India does not speak, it is fine, but if it speaks, it will be astonishing. Its resistance to racial discrimination is not only the resistance of all the people of East Asia but also the great resistance of all mankind to the inhumane world order of the enemy. This kind of resistance from all mankind is a weapon that the enemy, Britain and America, must understand and is most afraid to understand in this war. It is more powerful and terrifying than any of their material weapons.</p>
<h3>Army and People United, Immense Strength</h3>
<p>Examining the ever-improving offensive in Burma, one can discover a major fact: the posture of the new Asia, acting in unison, united and firm. At present, there are armies from three independent countries on the Burmese front, working together in a tense and fierce situation. This kind of unity is based on a firm belief that will never change. This belief is perhaps one of the forces that determine the Greater East Asia War. What is even more important is that behind these three armies is a large army with immense strength: the entire Burmese nation. Our efforts in the war of all-out strength are now playing a great role in the smoke-filled Kassapa region. The enemy's airborne transport force has suffered a major blow from the beginning due to the heroic resistance of the Burmese. This is just one example.</p>
<h3>Enemy Propaganda Counterproductive</h3>
<p>The reality in Burma is like this everywhere, at all times. The enemy army is being deceived by its own propaganda, but this propaganda only invites our contempt and scorn. The iron will of the Burmese cannot be shaken by it. The enemy army's invasion of India is now turning into the Japanese army's attack on Imphal. This is an absolutely true fact. A new nation is developing vigorously day and night in Burma. Although the war has not yet ended, we must continue to struggle. No matter what sacrifices we make, we must complete the great cause. We have the spirit of disregarding any sacrifice in order to achieve our goals. In this war, we are exerting all our efforts and rising up to fight for the highest goals.</p>
<h3>New Situation in Burmese Air Combat</h3>
<p>The ambitions of Britain and the United States to regain Burma in order to gain control of the air and reopen the route to support Chiang Kai-shek have intensified the air battle in Burma and India. Both sides are strengthening their air defense systems. The current state of air combat is that, under the absolute requirement to surpass the opponent's air defense measures, flights are gradually moving to higher altitudes and night flights are being developed, creating new leaps forward in time and space. Air combat in the extreme high altitudes and even the stratosphere has already become a real issue, and the difficulties of night air raids are about to be overcome.</p>
<p>During the aerial annihilation battles in India last year from January to February, the Hurricane aircraft that challenged the Japanese army stationed there initially flew at an altitude of only two to three thousand meters, but later reached five to six thousand meters. From March, the altitude increased day by day, and around April and May, it suddenly exceeded eight thousand meters and came to counterattack. In terms of aircraft, especially fighter aircraft, altitude is speed and power. When higher than the enemy, in addition to being able to use formations to control the attack, one can also decisively end the battle with one strike. Furthermore, it is easy to implement dispersed pursuit. Conversely, if lower than the enemy, one must first evade the enemy's attack to reverse the unfavorable position, otherwise, one cannot gain control of the battle.</p>
<h3>Efforts in High-Altitude Combat</h3>
<p>Therefore, both sides are very concerned and are working hard on high-altitude combat, competing with each other for altitude. The air combat after the rainy season last year was very different from before the rainy season. Britain has prepared new, high-altitude performance, excellent aircraft to replace the old Hurricane aircraft, while the United States has strengthened its P-51 aircraft. Since the aerial battles on the Arakan front at the end of last year, as well as in the air offensives in Calcutta, Dum Dum, and other places, the dogfights between the fighters of both sides have mostly taken place at an altitude of eight to nine thousand meters. Of course, this is not enough to defeat the Japanese Hayabusa fighter, which has excellent aerial performance and pilots, but the high-altitude performance of the enemy aircraft is not to be taken lightly. Leaving aside the threat of anti-aircraft guns, because the high-altitude performance of fighter aircraft has reached this level, the bombing altitude of bombers has also increased accordingly. For example, the bombing by the American Consolidated B-24, compared to before the rainy season last year, is usually at an altitude of one to three thousand meters higher. The Consolidated B-24 and other aircraft that intrude over Rangoon during the day, although their bodies are extremely large, their flying altitude is rare even among fighter aircraft.</p>
<p>It is said that the enemy has unveiled the B-29 (Boeing) superbomber, which they have boasted is a stratospheric bomber. The altitude of air raids is increasing day by day. The altitude and speed of reconnaissance aircraft are of the greatest concern to both sides. Aircraft such as the British Mosquito have been intruding into the Rangoon area at an altitude of nine to ten thousand meters.</p>
<p>In this way, the air battle on the Burmese front has now broken into the stage of high-altitude combat, becoming an essential requirement for achieving victory.</p>
<h3>Enemy Emphasizes Night Raids</h3>
<p>Another noteworthy point is that recent enemy aircraft attacks have been mainly at night. After the rainy season last year, the enemy, who had been clamoring to counterattack Burma from the air, gradually conducted large-scale air raids on Burma from October to November. Each time, they suffered great losses due to the strong Japanese defenses. On December 1, a dozen Consolidated B-24 bombers, escorted by P-51 fighters, were shot down entirely over Rangoon. After this, the daytime sorties of bombers were suspended. Seeing that the Japanese defenses were tight during the day, the enemy changed tactics and attempted to achieve their goals by attacking at night. The scale is quite small, with each raid involving only a dozen aircraft. However, their intentions and tactics have forced the Japanese to pay greater attention to both offense and defense in night air raids.</p>
<p>At night, due to the difficulties of navigation, the inconvenience of finding targets, and the methods of attack, there are various natural restrictions, but these restrictions also apply to the defenders. Moreover, conversely, the difficulties of navigating at night make it difficult to counterattack, which is an excellent condition for enemy air raids. With the development of weather forecasting and radio navigation, as well as the development of lighting and aiming equipment, if they undergo rigorous training, they may be able to exert more power at night than during the day.

<h3>Special Yuan System Abolished in North and Central China</h3>
<p>Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Special Yuan settlement system in North and Central China, which has been implemented since the freezing of assets in July of the 30th year of the Republic, has exerted a special function in transactions and settlements between the two regions.

<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech at the General Assembly of the National Socialist Party's local leaders on the 1st, revealing Germany's confidence in overcoming the crisis. The main points are as follows: Although we have achieved victory in this war, we have also experienced failures.

When the leader and his comrades did not deviate from this fundamental idea, they adhered to the final goal in all developments and battles of [inaudible], and adhered to the final goal, which is especially important in the crisis. In the war for our right to survive, we only seek victory. We must not forget that we have broken through the enemy's encirclement in 1939. The war in the east is only part of the world war, so the development of the eastern front has become [inaudible]. To judge correctly, it can only be linked to other operations. Regarding the possible development of Western Europe, we will control the situation with effective methods. The people are heavily responsible for the air war, but the Anglo-American air raids have not been able to help German arms production.

While the merchants are making requests for their own interests, and the association is very willing to accommodate the merchants' opinions as much as possible in carrying out autonomous control for the commercial collective, the association has been entrusted with a mission and is reluctant to delay the matter indefinitely due to illegitimate requests. It is hereby announced that from today, all requests regarding retention or exemption from purchase will be uniformly rejected in order to achieve a prompt conclusion.</p>

<h3>Director Zhang of the Thrift Association Broadcasted Last Night</h3>
<p>"The Thrift of Medicine"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Thrift Association broadcasts regularly every week. Yesterday at 7:40 PM, it was still held at the Shanghai Radio Station. Director Zhang of the association personally came to give a speech amidst his busy schedule, titled "The Thrift of Medicine." The main points of his broadcast are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reduce Disease and Save Medicine</p>
<p>"In life, in addition to the four major elements of clothing, food, housing, and transportation that need to be saved, there is also medicine that needs to be saved. The expenses for clothing, food, housing, and transportation can still be budgeted, but not for medicine. As the saying goes, people have unpredictable fortune and misfortune every day. The amount of expenses is unpredictable, and its consumption is also unlimited. Currently, the price of medicine is very high. It is difficult to guarantee that one will not get sick in their lifetime. It is really necessary to save medicine. Therefore, we need to strive not to get sick and reduce diseases as much as possible. There are many ways to reduce diseases. The most important thing is to pay attention to daily life. Food should be moderate, and clothing does not need to be elaborate. Add clothes when it is cold, reduce clothes when it is hot, get up early and go to bed early, and exercise the body often. Then diseases can be reduced naturally. Serious diseases become lighter, and major diseases turn into minor illnesses. If you unfortunately get sick, you must not be afraid in your heart. Strive to calm down. If you panic too much, delay seeing a doctor and taking medicine, the loss will be huge, then minor illnesses will become major illnesses, and light illnesses will turn into serious ones.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Use of Tonics is of No Practical Benefit</p>
<p>Finally, I advise citizens not to indiscriminately take tonics. We often see people who take tonics eat less and become lazy. Tonics only supplement a part of physiology but do not help in practice. Moreover, they are expensive and can be saved as much as possible. According to the current consumption of tonics, it is a waste for the rich, and it affects the lives of the poor even more. Some people think that drug stores will lose money and doctors will have no business. But we are willing to do so, and we hope that our compatriots will pay attention to their health, save on medical expenses, and build a strong East Asian nation."</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Yuwen Entrusted to Handle Special Scholarship Funds</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yuwen, the manager of the Southeast Tobacco Company, entrusted this newspaper to handle special scholarship funds and donated 30,700 yuan to select 18 students above the high school level. We deeply admire his cultivation of talents. Furthermore, the donations received from all walks of life yesterday were also very enthusiastic. We would like to express our gratitude to the impoverished students on their behalf.</p>
<p>Donations Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The list of scholarship funds received yesterday is as follows: Yang Songying 1,000 yuan, Anonymous 650 yuan, Xu Jing'an, Xie Jinyuan, Queen's New Fashion Company 200 yuan each, Pielan colleagues 121 yuan, Chen Meigu 100 yuan, Li Wangshi, Ji Songsheng, Ma Zhiliang 50 yuan each, Zhu Yantian 30 yuan, Pu Qiting (commemorating Yue Fei) 20 yuan, Zhang Yuwen (entrusted to handle special scholarship funds to select 18 students above the high school level) 30,700 yuan, Chen Yugang (returned scholarship funds) 600 yuan, Defeng colleagues 387 yuan, Xiao Shishi 100 yuan, totaling 34,458 reserve coupons, with a balance of 1,464,486 yuan.</p>
<p>Short Comment</p>
<h3>Contribution to the Aircraft Donation Movement Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Aircraft Donation Movement Committee has been promoting and advancing the work with all its might since it was launched, which is admirable.</p>
<p>The significance of the aircraft donation movement has been understood by all citizens and will not be explained further. However, we look forward to achieving even more satisfactory results from this movement and offer some humble opinions:</p>
<p>It is remembered that before 1937, the government also launched a similar movement and received a broad response from the people. However, the results were that the personnel of the handling agencies were not sound, and the amount and use of donations were not made public, causing general controversy. We hope that the authorities handling this matter will pay special attention to this point and disclose the amount of various donations raised, various expenses, and methods of safekeeping at any time, such as charity performances of Peking opera and musical food, etc., to show great credibility. We believe that publishing income and expenses will not only demonstrate credibility but also promote the righteous deeds of donors and the enthusiastic emotions of donors, thereby arousing widespread recognition from society. We are confident that the responsible authorities will adopt this intention.</p>

<h3>Supervising Intra-Industry Trading Associations Strictly Enforce Scheduled Delivery of Goods Upon Completion of Transactions</h3>
<p>Industry associations have recently received orders from the authorities to prevent speculators from creating trouble, and strict regulations have been established for intra-industry trading: Industries should abide by laws and regulations and must not use other companies' trademarks or brands. Customers must issue order forms when placing orders, indicating the name of the goods, price, quantity, and delivery date. Intra-industry transactions must issue a transaction order, with each of the buying and selling parties holding one copy, and another copy submitted to the market management committee or industry association for reference. Goods from completed transactions must be delivered and paid for on schedule and must not be deliberately delayed. Incoming goods from the trade must be distributed to the medium-sized parties in the market within one month. Incoming goods from the medium-sized parties should be displayed in the retail department for people to choose and buy, but they must absolutely not exceed the legal profit margin, etc.</p>
<h3>Financial and Industrial Commerce, Market Conditions are Stable</h3>
<p>Financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai are generally stable. The interest rate is stationary, and the call loan interest rate has not changed. Stock prices have turned from falling to rising gradually. Although the money market is still tight, the Central Reserve Bank supplies as much as possible to legitimate industrial and commercial needs. Therefore, financial personnel are using funds in an exceptionally flexible manner. The black market of the ratio between the Joint Reserve Notes and the Central Reserve Notes, which was created by speculative merchants last week, has been gradually eliminated since the Central Reserve Bank designated eleven Sino-Japanese commercial banks to handle the exchange of the Joint Reserve Notes of North China. As for various industrial and commercial sectors, the circulation of funds is lively because the authorities supply as much as possible for legitimate needs. In particular, the relevant authorities have been preventing the activities of speculative industrial and commercial people and strictly cracking down on hoarding, which has caused hoarders to continuously sell off hoarded goods. Both wholesale and retail market prices of various daily necessities have gradually declined. Therefore, market conditions are trending towards normal, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Timber Industry Association Regulates the Scope of Business Operations for Fellow Traders</h3>
