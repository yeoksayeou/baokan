<h3>社評　組織民生考察團</h3>
<p>政府決定施政方針，必須顧到人民的要求，然後，施政順利，人民獲益。根據人民要求的施政方針，就是仁政。孟子所說的：「行仁政，民之悅之，猶解倒懸也。」可見仁政與人民關係的重要。這是一般行政的原則，同不待閘釋。如果，政策政令之決定，僅憑少數官吏閉門造車，或則參酌主觀的經騐，不與先師的人民要求相合符，那就成問題了。</p>
<p>誠然，所謂「人民的要求」，似乎範圍廣泛，很難有明確的具體的標準。怎樣才能顧到？怎樣才算願到？無從明顯確定。但是，我們認為顧到人民要求者，就是在決定施政方針之先，不只是憑藉少數人主觀的經騐，而須客觀的從各方而博採人民的輿情，從實地考察人民的需要與環境，然後參酌主觀的行政經騐。基於這種客觀考察與主觀經騐而決定的施政方針，就是願到人民要求的施政方針，就是「仁政」。</p>
<p>從各方面博採人民的奧情，最易入手的方法，就是建立民意機關·因為民意機關可以傳達人民與情，溝通官民意見。從實地考察人民的需要與環境，最易入手的方法，就是選派公正大員深入民間。因為公正大員深入民間，可以明瞭人民疾苦與所處環境，明瞭民隱民情、所以，我們一面主張建立民意機構，溝通比意；一面主張選派公正大員深人民間，考察民隱，作為決定施政方針的根據。</p>
<p>戰前國民政府在監察院外，並有益監察使之設置，但其主要任務在於行駛彈劾職務僅爲消極的對於人事方面檢舉貪污。而目前國民政府並此監察使亦未設置。當此中樞政治力求革新的今日，當此民生疾苦嚴重的今日，我們認爲實地考察民生疾苦，然後決定革新方針，實爲必要。於此，我們貢獻管見如次：</p>
<p>由中樞當局選派公正大員，組織民生考察團，分赴各地，深入民間。</p>
<p>考察團員人選，除現任官吏以外，得聘請民間公正人士，素孚人望者參與其間。</p>
<p>考察團輕車簡從，每到一地，純以超然地位，拒絕官方酬酢，多與民間接觸·團員分組考察，詳細紀錄民隱民情。必要時向地方官諮詢意見，以備參考·</p>
<p>考察目標，以民生為主，兼及生產，治安，敎育，以及中日關係等問題·</p>
<p>盟邦日本政府為調查目前食糧，動勞，電波兵器三行政部鬥之詳情，派遣大臣及內閣觀問等大員分任查察使，根據查察結果，泱定將現有之臨時措置辦法，進而確立為根木對策·值得我們倣效。中樞長官頗多國民黨同志來自民間者，對於民間疾苦，更應有所同情。希望從速促成，改善民生，革新政治，實利賴之。</p>

<h3>兩種偏向</h3>
<p>記者從上海出發時，在正確的方向以外，認為尚有二個可慮的偏向。這是因為不理解靑黃不接期的意義而生。修正此種無知，不祇是記老個人的希望，也是內地共同的要求。那麼，這二種偏向是什麼呢？</p>
<p>其一，忘却現在是靑黃不接期的對策論。例如：抽象的米統會人事變更第一主義的主張，設價官督民營的上海米糧公倉公司提案，為推進四郊徽購而設立聯合辦事論等等，都忽視時間的緊急性，如果祇撥鎮船頭而可以渡過波浪滔天的海，則祇須每天調換不統會的主任委員，秘書長，或其他關係機關的負賣者好了。可是在這嚴重的時期，機稱刷新與機稱調整應嚴為區別。決不是機情或人事的調整。設量公倉公司論亦然。建造足容一千萬石米糧的大會庫，動員數十億的民族資本，自然很好。可是布靑黃不接期所需要者，不是空空如也的倉庫與股東名薄，而是堆積如山的米袋。怎樣收買那些米，怎樣搬入，應該是首先考慮的。不以此種具體的對策為第一，則雖設立大倉庫公司，亦不會開始的。設置食米對策聯合辦事處論亦然。祇在龐大的米統會及其他機關之上，設置聯合辦裏處，決定主任以下的人事，遺完全忘却了事態的緊急性。</p>
<p>以上諸案是記者從上海出發前由各機關所提議的，但遍歷各地所見的現實事態，切實地感到不能這樣好整以暇的從容進行了。</p>
<p>另一傾向是祇在準備上海周圍的搬入口，而忘却迅速改組內地收買體制的傾向。上海的米價問題，米糧問題，足以左右內地，那在一方面是對的，但在另一方面，內地的米糧問題，米價問題，也足以左右上海。米的問題，不祇存在於被包園在六十公里統制綫中的上海，而深刻地存在於整個華中主要的點，綫及面。就地域而言，與其點，不如綫；與其綫，不如取而的政策。就時間而言，不應祗是靑黃不接期的對策，而應從速確立本米糧年度的整個政策。忘却這二點，僅重視靑黃不接期對策的臨時性質，不用說，那是非常錯誤的。內地米糧問題的實情，耍求南京與上海淸算對靑黃不接期認識的不够。</p>
<h3>收買困難原因</h3>
<p>記者在崑山，松江曾向米統會辦事處幹部詢問，將來怎樣打開收買的困難？得到的回答如此：</p>
<h3>崑山</h3>
<p>一，提高收買價格。二，嚴懲偷運囤積三，以肥料配給農民四，對採辦商放欵。五，米統會從速開始收買工作。六，米統會組織武裝檢查隊。</p>
<h3>松山</h3>
<p>一，提高收買價格。二，檢查偷運囤積。三，實行物物交換。四。按保甲制度定額供出民食用以外的米糧。五，保證地方治安。六，便利運輪。七，禁絕沿途苛捐雜稅。道些回答，都是極原則的，公式的，業已成為常識的肅正環境之要求而已。而記者從米統會辦事處所欲聞的，米統會及其各地辦事處，應該自已反省，對於肅正環見，是怎樣的無力。上次舉行的各地辦事處聯席會議的提案中，也不見提起這問題，記者不能不深感遺憾。大家都知道，在聽到從米統會發出的自我反省之前，華方一部份爭言論機關，對米杭會會痛加抨擊。那就是刷新人事第一的論調。一般民衆也因為對米統會期待過殷，以致失望，而視為刷新人事乃是當然的。但刷新人事果然是打開工作的主要方法嗎？記者的目的之一，乃欲檢討在內地的實情中·收買困難的原因何在？關於這一點，不能得到明確的結論，在上海，沒有人把使收買啄難的最六六原因加以主號的檢討，僅平面的羅列諸原因，並主張平面的對策論。但在內地，從事收買工作的人們，及負責指導收買工作的人們，異口同聲的說，米统會開始以來收買困難的最大原因是開始收賈的遲延。換句話說，其主要原因，與其設是米統會開始後人事的不健全，及工作的不順利，不如設是米統會開始前決定政東的遲延，及確立新構械的停頓。所以將收賈困雞的諉之於米統會，而對誕生米統會時的理念與方法不要求反省的主張，乃政爭的米統會倒論，在內地當然痛被抨學。（擇當六月二十一日大陸新報竹本特派員無錫通訊）</p>

<h3>讀者助學消息　新舊生甲請辦法一律</h3>
<p>助學金辦事處核發中請書，以新舊報名學生一併計算在內，是以規定百分之五比例以外，凡第六屆受助學生較多各校，皆酌量增發，俾各校所領申請書至少足够分發舊生之之用。（惟總數亦以不超過百分之二十為度），凡萬生之合附者，自應儘先予以申請機會。惟舊生中如有家境尚可，不需補助，或學行太差，不堪造就者，亦應予以限制。各校分發申請當時，當己顯及此兩方面。所以不論新生舊生，凡己被學校拒絕分發申請書者，不得直接向辦事處要求添發。</p>
<p>胃領申請書毫無用處　有少數學校之申請書，照辦事處記錄，己經核發完畢，而學校堅持並不收到，顯係有人肩領。惟辦事處發出申請書俱有記錄，凡不以合法手續取得之由，請書，如填就送回，概不受理。所以冒領中請書，實毫無用處也。</p>
<p>望各校當局注意本處辦事人員曾於昨日舉行全體會議，檢討本屈助學金工作一般問題，通過妥案多起，茲據述兩點，敬以奉告各校當當局。　請各學校多設免費及半費學額，以救濟貧苦優秀之成生。查申新兩報雖有助貸學金之設究以基金有限，難免粥少憎多，滄海遣珠，殊深遺憾！如各校能多設免費或半贊學額，則眾墊易舉，收效愈廣，想各校長熱心敎靑，當不河漢斯言。　運日來館哭訴之學生，踵趾相接，僉謂校長强令苦學生出繳留額金，否則不發，亦有不照本處定章，不作公允處置，而以面情為重，致有合格學生，未能領得申請書，諸如此類，無怪學生來館申訢矣。茲經決讓：一則希望各校長秉公審核，不徇情，不留難。原夫敎育為良心事業，與一般商業情形，迴不相同；二則希望學生方面，舉實告發，倘有此種不合理不公允之事實發生，本報當加以調查，作適當致應付</p>

<h3>國民論　零售布店的苦衷</h3>
<p>— 陳楚本</p>
<p>零布店顧名思議，便知爲棉布商中範圍最小資本最小之布商，開設於南陽橋及滬西康腦脫路逸帶，其昔年營業範圍，係向各布廠收集殘廢零布出售於鄉莊客人，所經所營，本爲貧苦生意。去年國府收買棉紗棉布，另布亦經收買在內，爲擁護國策，自應將全部貨物，向商統會申請出責，從此閉門坐食，迄今將年，已到山窮水書之境，範圍較大資本較充之布商，早已改營別業，另布店資本短小，改業無資，只得坐以待斃。</p>
<p>此次棉布臨時配給，由布號一差聯營處承辦，購布證總額共計三‘餘萬張，其零售商配售數量，漫無規定，另布商範圍小，資本短，人微言輕，名義上雖列爲零售問之一，實則只有配售數百張至一千餘張，其配給貨物，完全根據保留品及店中存貨，而發售之，外面無寸尺配進。零布店所備之貨，原為經濟耐用之平民貨色，加以保留品係屬零碼部份，零碼部份即歷年揀存之貨，尺碼長短不一，顏色未免失時，所以此次配給，自必多所困難，因此引起各界之不滿，以種種不白之冤，飪加於零布店身上。實則零布先天不足，尚有何貨可以換出，並無劣貨換入之事。</p>
<p>此次購布證發配地段，似亦欠當，零布所存之貨，多爲經濟耐用之類，如元糾紋元細布等等，極合鄉人鈉路，如配給浦東鄉人，最爲適宜，發證當局，不明情形，配發於本埠仕女，因不合其用，是以種稱之罪孽加之於零布店身上，零布店每日受他們不白之氣。此事不能錯怪發澄當局，聯營處不將同業狀況，向當同告明，涉威今日各界隊於權布配</p>
<p>此次臨時配給購布證，有效期，爲六個月，零布店配售數社，只有數兩張至一千餘張，每證貨值，若以二百元計算，總值不過首十餘萬元自二十餘萬元，以目下一萬元米價計算，最小範圍，每月開支須在四五萬元，六個月開支，共須二三十萬元，所以棉布賣完之日，即本鈿吃完之時，到該時零布商全號失業，恐非社會之福也，還請賢明當局，加以注意之。</p>
<p>鄙人為棉布商中零布組之一，不明坐以待斃，不願受質主無故之氣，更不甘受社會無端冤枉，對此次配售，自願放棄，將貨物移配大門市商發售，如此各界買主，自農至書，鵠立於馬路上，享受優良棉布配售，零布店亦可以早臼結東，夥友解散，閉門大吉矣。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>海軍畫家（四）</p>
<p>「這也不一定吧！只是畫法不能千篇一律。例如超現實主義的作品，也有畫軍艦的。那種軍艦是值得稱讚的，但岩田口君的畫法，却有點不同。」</p>
<p>獨原於是就把話說得難聽了。</p>
<p>「不要緊，請不要客氣地批評！」</p>
<p>市來很急促地要求。</p>
<p>「如不客氣地說，我認為與其說是作品，勿寧說近乎廣告畫。」</p>
<p>「哈哈，這種批評有點過火吧！那末我的畫，也豈不是就成為高價的廣告畫了麼？」</p>
<p>市來很爽快地袒護　隆夫，而這樣笑着說。</p>
<p>隆夫對於這種批評，是耐着性子聽下去的。要說的話固然很多，但姑且忍受一下。過了片刻，隆夫以顫動的聲音問：</p>
<p>「先生，議搬塲公司的人等得太久了，是否可以讓她們給我送回去了？」</p>
<p>「呵，等一下吧，這一張畫不可以暫時放在我這裏幾天麼？」</p>
<p>市來好像是想到了什麽，才這樣說。</p>
<h3>（五）</h3>
<p>隆夫出了市來的家，心中總是七上八下地，糊糊塗塗地，拖着木屐，一直跑到洗足車站。</p>
<p>「新橋一張！」</p>
<p>在售票處氣憤憤地這樣說。</p>
<p>他並不想一直回到公寓裏來。跑到銀座大街，拖着以前巴里黨的同事，想到酒館去喝啤酒去。</p>
<p>（廣告畫，究竟是什麽？）</p>
<p>坐在開始前駛的電車中，在心中喊了這樣一聲。</p>
<p>（畫蘋果就是作品，畫軍艦就是廣告畫麼？不要隨便說人！）</p>
<p>他的憤慨，在五反田換了車，仍然還未消逝。（我從小就喜歡海軍，所以才畫海軍艦的。我畫的短處，固然知道，但軍艦得很幼稚，很通俗，其理由究竟在什麽地方呢？）</p>
<p>就是在新橋站下車時，隆夫仍然還在生氣。</p>
<p>（去他的。廣告畫九讓它是廣告畫吧！縱或蘋果畫家反對，但也要偏偏　具有極大宣傳力的廣告畫。假如價有宣傳力，那就是好的藝術。那就是好的畫。誰說也不管！）</p>
<p>於是便成為奔放的隆夫。他對於鶴原敬一發生了很大的惡感，就是把他活吃了也不足以解其恨。</p>
<p>過新橋的時候，突然看到了墨雲密集的天空。從京橋方面吹來了寒冷的風，眞好像冬天太陽將落的陰沉風景。但，銀座大街的下午五時，仍然還熱鬧非常。</p>
<p>（面部表情，沒有一個好的。）</p>
<p>餘憤尙未消逝的隆夫，甚至對於銀座大街上步行的男女，也不起什麽好感。凡是穿着漂漂亮亮的衣服，趾高氣揚在走路的羣衆，隆夫都覺着像鶴原敬一一類的人。</p>
<p>他聳着肩，在人海中向前而去。這位像瘋人一樣，蓬鬆着頭髮，眼鏡後面的眼睛裏像帶着血珠一樣，這就是隆夫的畫像，所以銀座大街上的文雅行路人，都給他讓路。</p>
<p>不大的工夫，他正想拐彎，向巴里堂的辦公室去。在銀座大街的人羣縫中，看見一位穿着古銅色西裝，戴着灰色帽子的男人，在偷看他，突然衝到隆夫的身上來。</p>
<p>「他媽的，看不見人麼？」</p>
<p>「呵，對不起！」</p>
<p>那個男人率直地道了歉，但一看那個人的臉，隆夫就腿也酸了，嘴也不靈了。（一〇四）</p>

<h3>Editorial: Organizing a People's Livelihood Investigation Group</h3>
<p>When the government decides on its policies, it must take into account the demands of the people. Only then will the implementation of policies be smooth and the people will benefit. A policy based on the demands of the people is benevolent governance. Mencius said, "Practicing benevolent governance gladdens the people as if they were being rescued from hanging upside down." This shows the importance of the relationship between benevolent governance and the people. This is a general principle of administration and needs no further explanation. However, if policy decisions are made by a small number of officials behind closed doors, or based on subjective experience, without aligning with the people's demands, then it becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Admittedly, the so-called "demands of the people" seem to be broad in scope, and it is difficult to have a clear and concrete standard. How can we take them into account? How can we be considered to have taken them into account? It is impossible to determine clearly. However, we believe that taking the people's demands into account means that, before deciding on policies, we should not only rely on the subjective experience of a few people, but also objectively gather public opinion from all sides and investigate the needs and circumstances of the people in the field. Then, we should consider subjective administrative experience. A policy based on such objective investigation and subjective experience is a policy that takes the people's demands into account, and is "benevolent governance."</p>
<p>The easiest way to gather public opinion from all sides is to establish a representative body, because a representative body can convey the people's sentiments and facilitate communication between officials and the people. The easiest way to investigate the needs and circumstances of the people in the field is to select impartial high-ranking officials to go deep into the grassroots. Because impartial high-ranking officials can understand the people's suffering and environment, and understand their concerns and feelings. Therefore, we advocate establishing a representative body to facilitate communication, and at the same time, we advocate selecting impartial high-ranking officials to go deep into the grassroots to investigate the people's concerns, as a basis for deciding on policies.</p>
<p>Before the war, the National Government had supervisory commissioners in addition to the Control Yuan, but their main task was to exercise the power of impeachment, which was only a passive way to report corruption in personnel matters. Currently, the National Government has not even established these supervisory commissioners. At a time when the central political power is striving for reform, and at a time when the people's livelihood is seriously suffering, we believe that it is necessary to investigate the people's livelihood in the field and then decide on a reform plan. Here, we offer our humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>The central authorities should select impartial high-ranking officials to organize a people's livelihood investigation group to go to various places and deep into the grassroots.</p>
<p>In addition to current officials, the members of the investigation group may invite impartial people from the private sector who are respected by the people to participate.</p>
<p>The investigation group should travel lightly and simply, and maintain a detached position in each place they visit, refusing official entertainment and interacting more with the people. The members should be divided into groups to conduct investigations and record the people's concerns and feelings in detail. If necessary, they should consult with local officials for reference.</p>
<p>The investigation should focus on the people's livelihood, and also cover production, security, education, and Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>The Allied government of Japan has dispatched ministers and cabinet councilors to serve as inspectors to investigate the details of the current food, labor, and radio wave weapons administrations. Based on the inspection results, they have decided to transform the existing temporary measures into fundamental countermeasures, which is worthy of our emulation. Many of the central leaders are Kuomintang comrades from the grassroots and should have more sympathy for the people's suffering. We hope that they will promptly promote this initiative to improve the people's livelihood and reform politics, which will be truly beneficial.</p>
<h3>Fierce Resistance by Japanese Garrison from Strategic Positions; Intense Battle Unfolds on Saipan Island; Tinian Island Artillery Barrage; U.S. Forces Bombed Across the Water</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, 20th – The U.S. military's attacks on Saipan Island are becoming increasingly fierce. On the 17th, a U.S. force, under the cover of dozens of bombers, attacked the vicinity of the Aslito airfield on the south side of Saipan Island, and continued to reinforce its forces and transport several heavy artillery pieces, stubbornly attacking regardless of sacrifices. The Japanese garrison is defending its strategic positions heroically, and is also launching surprise attacks, fiercely attacking the enemy, or engaging in hand-to-hand combat, launching a heroic bayonet charge, or using small units to penetrate the enemy ranks and fight them. The Japanese tank units are also resolutely attacking the enemy from behind the landing point. The Japanese artillery battery on Tinian Island is responding to the army's fierce battle, and is fiercely bombarding the enemy and enemy artillery (positions) across the water.</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Chu Congratulates on Victory; Cables Foreign Minister Shigemitsu of Japan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – Allied naval officers and men defeated the U.S. military in the Mariana Islands this time and achieved unprecedented results. Foreign Minister Chu cabled Foreign Minister Shigemitsu of Japan on the 21st to congratulate him on the victory. The original cable is as follows: To His Excellency Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, I have just learned that your country's naval officers and men have loyally established special merits in the Mariana Islands, defeating the U.S. military. The good news has arrived, and I am filled with admiration. I see that final victory will come soon. I especially send this telegram to congratulate you and wish you good health. Chu Minyi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese General Headquarters announced the battle situation of the capture of Changsha and the Mariana Islands, German newspapers published the news simultaneously on the 21st. The German people were extremely surprised and delighted. The Berlin Evening News published the news on the front page of its evening edition on the 21st, using half a page to report the great results of the Japanese military sinking one battleship, two cruisers, destroying eleven warships, and six transport ships in the Mariana Islands, as announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. German current affairs commentator Admiral Westphal added that he already knew which side had the stronger fighting spirit, so he could only quietly observe the progress of the battle.</p>
<h3>Hunan War Enters Second Stage; Japanese Military Achieves Remarkable Results</h3>
<p>Changsha, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese forces in Hunan, after attacking Changsha, Liuyang, and Zhuzhou, and defeating the 15th Division of the field army of the Ninth War Zone, continued to advance in order to completely eliminate Xue Yue's troops. Therefore, the war in Hunan has now entered the second stage. When Xue Yue defended Changsha, he dispatched the best-equipped Fourth Army (Commander Wang Deneng) and four divisions to the defense positions around Changsha, to put up a desperate resistance. However, due to the Japanese army's use of a double encirclement tactic to launch a fierce attack, the Chongqing army completely lost its will to fight. After only two days and nights of resistance, they used their forces to sweep away the defeated Chongqing troops around Changsha, and the sweeping battle is almost complete. As of noon on the 20th, the results of the Japanese army's capture of Changsha, as confirmed, included approximately 8,000 Chongqing troops killed and approximately 5,000 captured, as well as the seizure of approximately 60 artillery pieces.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Acknowledges Fall of Changsha</h3>
<p>Casablanca, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Chongqing military headquarters issued a public announcement on the evening of the 20th, stating that since the 18th, all radio communication with Changsha had been cut off, and that the Japanese army had occupied Changsha on that day.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The war results of the new Hunan operation and the Tongguan operation, as obtained by the Japanese army, are as follows: (New Hunan Operation) (A) The damage inflicted on the Chongqing army by the troops in various places: Changsha: the Fourth Army (directly under the Central Army), the 59th, 90th, 102nd, and 105th Divisions; near Liuyang: the 44th Army (Sichuan-based), the 161st Division; the 37th Army (Central-based), the 60th Division; the 58th Army (Yunnan-based), the newly organized 10th and 11th Divisions; the Newly Organized Third Army (Yunnan-based), the 183rd Division; along the Miluo River: the 20th Army (Sichuan-based), the 133rd Division, and the Newly Organized 30th Division; the 99th Army (directly under the Central Army), the 99th Division; near Yuanjiang, Yiyang, and Ningxiang: the 99th Army (directly under the Central Army), the 92nd Division; the 73rd Army, the 77th Division; near Zhuzhou: the Provisional Second Army (Guangdong-based), the 7th Division; near Tongcheng: the Newly Organized 72nd Army (Sichuan-based), the Newly Organized 13th Division. (B) War results of the Japanese Air Force: From June 1st to 12th, 143 enemy planes were shot down or destroyed, and 180 ships were destroyed or sunk. The Japanese side lost 11 planes that did not return. Enemy planes are currently using Lingling, Hengyang, Suichuan, and Enshi as their central bases. Since May 27th, approximately 600 enemy planes have been deployed, but they have suffered heavy damage from Japanese attacks. (C) War results near Mount Yuelu: As of the afternoon of the 19th, it has been confirmed that approximately 1,600 enemy corpses were left behind, 2,000 people were captured, 1,000 were killed, and 39 artillery pieces, 14 heavy artillery pieces, and 13 mountain artillery pieces were seized. (D) Naval units: Near Xiangyin in Dongting Lake, enemy-laid mines were discovered and the Japanese army advanced straight to Changsha. (E) Near Tongguan, the 14th Army of the Central Army suffered a major blow in the Battle of Luoyang. The 40th Army (directly under the Central Army) is the remnant of the defeated troops of the First War Zone; the First Army is the most outstanding of the Central Army and is currently facing Tongguan; the 57th Army is the Central Army reinforced from southern Ningxia; the 16th Army is the first-class army defending the Yellow River in front of Puzhou.

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Declaration issued last autumn already stipulated Japan's post-war policies and various issues concerning Greater East Asia and the world. However, these policies are all theoretical and the specific methods still need to be studied. Now that the war has entered the decisive stage, all sectors of Japanese society believe that studying concrete countermeasures is a matter of urgency. Mr. Toshio Shiratori, former ambassador to the Vatican and current member of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, has initiated the organization of the Research Committee on Post-War Management Strategies, and has appointed himself as the chairman, recruiting authorities from political, academic, and financial circles to study various issues. The committee will be formally established on the 27th of this month, and will also establish special sub-committees on politics, diplomacy, economics, culture, and military affairs to study the fundamental conditions and concrete countermeasures for world permanent peace, and will submit the research results to the government for adoption. Under the chairman, the committee will also have three standing secretaries and twenty members, including social critic Chio Fujisawa, Imperial University Professor of Science Dr. Goma Araki, Army Major General and military commentator Mihei Oba, Director of the Population Problems Research Institute of the Ministry of Health Dr. Yoshiharu Furuya, member of the Imperial Art Academy and composer Kosaku Yamada, and Army Lieutenant General and member of parliament Nobutaka Shiōten.

<h3>New Budget Determined by South Borneo Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>Manila, 21st (Central News Agency) – The budget for this year has been decided by the South Borneo Japanese Naval Military Administration. According to the implementation status of the previous year, important decisive war plans are incorporated. According to the new budget, the total amount of the temporary military expenditure and the civil administration accounting budget is about 50% higher than that of the previous year. The main increased items in the new regulations of the civil administration accounting include resource development, food production increase, subsidy for killing assistance, subsidies for medical and cultural undertakings, and capital injection into the common people's bank. In addition, the expenses for repairing and educating are strengthened to seek to establish a local self-sufficiency system and promote wartime construction. On the other hand, efforts are also being made to save regular expenses. The main items in the civil administration accounting revenue budget are taxes, and the target is the tax revenue from materials exported to Japan.</p>
<h3>U.S. Air Force Base Threatened</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese base, 21st (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army launched the Hunan operation, the U.S. Air Force bases in Weiyang, Lingling, Baoqing, and Luxiang in Hunan Province were under serious threat. In order to eliminate this threat, the U.S. Air Force is actively dispatching planes, and its activity is unprecedented. In order to cope with this situation, the Japanese air squadrons are currently searching for enemy traces everywhere and intercepting them at any time, inflicting heavy damage on them.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 21st (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, sent four B25-type aircraft and five P40-type aircraft to attack the Hunan front. When they arrived at Liuyang City, which was guarded by the Chongqing army, they seemed to mistakenly believe that the city had fallen, and suddenly launched a fierce bombing. At that time, the Chongqing army in the city was panic-stricken and thought that Japanese planes were attacking, so they fired fiercely with anti-aircraft guns. As a result, both sides suffered significant damage, and the chaotic situation of the so-called "integrated air and land cooperation" between the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army can be seen here.</p>

<h3>County Administrative Reform Plan; May Be Promulgated and Implemented Soon; Elevating the Status of County Magistrates and Unifying</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – In order to strengthen local administration, the central authorities reformed the provincial administrative structure and abolished unnecessary bureaus and departments, so the provincial administration is carried out much more smoothly. The county administrative reform plan has also been approved by the Executive Yuan meeting and has been submitted to the Central Political Committee for review.

It is reported that the five key points of this county administrative reform are: the unification and strengthening of county administration (such as concentrating power in the county magistrate, except for the provincial government or the administrative inspector's office, other agencies cannot issue orders to the county government. Enhancing the county magistrate's command and supervision power over various bureaus and sections, increasing the number of county government field personnel, etc.); elevating the status and treatment of county magistrates and county administrators (such as county magistrates should be senior or delegated, county magistrates should be registered and distributed by the central war examination, and should not be recommended and dispatched at will. Improving the treatment as much as possible, county magistrates should have sufficient special expenses, etc.); the unification and enrichment of county finances (such as making county finances independent, the provincial government should not withdraw suspense funds. County government political expenses should be paid by the provincial treasury, etc.); strengthening the institutions of townships and villages (such as setting up township and village cadres, etc.); unifying the organization of the Baojia system. All aspects have detailed regulations. After the implementation of this plan, the status and authority of the county magistrate can be raised and concentrated, and the administration, finance, and Baojia of each county can be completely unified, and the efficiency of local governance will be as expected. At the same time, if the central administrative structure is strengthened, the connection between the central and local governments will be closer, and the advancement of the entire national politics will be able to be accelerated and achieve greater results.</p>

<h3>American Northern Army Advances in Cotentin; Four Miles from Cherbourg Fortress; Battle of Carentan Decisive for Peninsula's Fate</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to German military authorities, the battle for the crucial strongpoint of Carentan in Normandy will determine the fate of the entire Cotentin Peninsula operation.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to British newspaper reports, American forces have reached Valognes, approximately four miles southwest of Cherbourg.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Houtong News Agency’s chief military correspondent, Sertorius, reports: The operational strategy and actions of the German defense zone along the Normandy coast are aimed at steady anticipation, minimizing the use of our own forces while inflicting maximum damage on the enemy. The American military operations on the Cotentin Peninsula are clearly focused on expanding their corridor, running north and south through the center of the peninsula. Currently, their main force seems to be advancing north towards Bricquebse in order to reach the Valognes area. The intention of the American commander, Bradley, appears to be to first penetrate the Cherbourg defense zone, then proceed with a planned siege. To gain freedom of movement, the American forces must expand their supply lines, but German resistance is extremely strong. In the area north and northeast of Carentan, only localized battles are occurring. The American forces are seemingly probing the German positions at La Saye, Carentan, Vierville, and Floying, as well as Sainte-Mère-Église. To the east, the British Second Army's advance towards Caumont has been pushed back by German counterattacks. On the 19th, the British retreated from Livry. On Monday, the British forces attacked the town of Tilly, but were forced to withdraw after a German counterattack. Attacks on both sides of Tilly also resulted in the British forces being routed due to heavy losses. No major battles are taking place in the Caen area. East of the Orne River, the German forces are pressing the American bridgehead, proceeding according to their predetermined plan. Large forces are concentrating in the rear of the British Second Army, and a large-scale offensive will be launched soon.</p>
<h3>1,500 American Aircraft Bombard Pas-de-Calais; Base for Launching V-1 Flying Bombs</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - After discovering bases for German V-1 flying bombs in the Pas-de-Calais region, Allied air forces have been bombing them continuously for days. According to reports from London, powerful American bombers fiercely attacked Pas-de-Calais yesterday. Reuters reports that approximately 1,500 American bombers bombed the area that day, resulting in fierce air battles. Simultaneously, German forces continued to bombard southern England with V-1 flying bombs. According to Associated Press reports from London, from the 19th to the 20th, the German forces carried out incessant bombing, causing casualties and damage.</p>
<h3>German Forces Use New Weapon in Air Battles</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Houtong News Agency reports: The Allied High Command stated that Allied airmen encountered another new German weapon while reconnoitering German V-1 flying bomb launcher bases along the northern coast of France yesterday.

It is speculated that this weapon is designed to destroy aircraft propellers.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from London, the German forces are continuing to bombard southern England with new weapons, and bombing is still ongoing as of the 19th. The buildings and lives destroyed and damaged in England are becoming increasingly serious. However, in addition to using anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes, the British military authorities have not yet shown any new countermeasures. The British Air Ministry announced on the night of the 19th that the German unmanned bombers are jet-propelled bombs launched from inclined ground in northern France. The launching part uses a rocket launching device. The aircraft body is approximately 21 feet and 10 inches long and 16 feet wide. Its range is approximately 160 miles, and its average speed is 350 miles per hour. The explosive force is approximately equal to that of a German 1,000 kg bomb. The explosion is contained within a torpedo head structure in a thin casing at the front of the aircraft body. The engine uses gasoline as fuel. The sound during flight is the continuous sound of the jet propulsion device. The structure is almost entirely made of steel. The aircraft number is fully coated with ordinary camouflage, the upper part is dark gray, and the bottom is light blue. Control is not by radio, but by an automatic control device installed in front of the launcher.</p>

The southern wing of the enemy bomber formation was protected by a strong fighter squadron. German fighters intercepted the enemy aircraft over the Baltic Sea coast and engaged the enemy in several air battles over central Germany. The air battles over Rügen Island were particularly fierce. German aircraft dispersed several enemy aircraft formations, damaging and shooting down several four-engine enemy aircraft. Most of these damaged enemy aircraft fled north, and a small number of bombers crashed into the Baltic Sea several miles off the German coast. A large number of American aircraft are feared to have been lost on their return journey or while flying into Swedish territory.

<h3>Two Kinds of Deviation</h3>
<p>When I left Shanghai, I felt that there were two kinds of worrying deviations besides the correct direction. This is caused by a lack of understanding of the significance of the period when the new harvest has not yet come in. Correcting this ignorance is not only my personal hope, but also a common requirement in the interior. So, what are these two kinds of deviations?</p>
<p>First, forgetting the countermeasures for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in. For example, abstract arguments for personnel changes in the Rice Control Association as the top priority, proposals for the Shanghai Rice Grain Public Warehouse Company under the system of government supervision and private management, and arguments for establishing a joint office to promote the purchase of rice from the suburbs, all ignore the urgency of time. If waves of the stormy sea could be overcome just by adjusting the rudder, then it would be enough to change the chairman, secretary-general, or other responsible person of the Rice Control Association every day. However, in this critical period, the refreshing of the organization and the adjustment of the organization should be strictly distinguished. It is definitely not just an adjustment of the organization's circumstances or personnel. The argument for establishing a public warehouse company is also the same. Building a large warehouse capable of holding ten million shi of rice and mobilizing billions of national capital is naturally a good thing. But what is needed during the period when the new harvest has not yet come in is not an empty warehouse and a list of shareholders, but piles of rice sacks. How to buy those rice and how to move it in should be the first thing to consider. If this kind of concrete countermeasure is not given top priority, then even if a large warehouse company is established, it will not start operating. The argument for setting up a joint office for rice countermeasures is also the same. Just setting up a joint office on top of the already huge Rice Control Association and other organizations, and deciding on the personnel below the director, completely forgets the urgency of the situation.</p>
<p>The above proposals were made by various organizations before I left Shanghai, but after traveling to various places and seeing the real situation, I feel strongly that it is not possible to proceed so leisurely.</p>
<p>Another tendency is to focus only on preparing the points of entry around Shanghai, while forgetting to quickly reorganize the purchase system in the interior. The price of rice and the rice problem in Shanghai are sufficient to influence the interior, which is true on the one hand, but on the other hand, the rice problem and the price of rice in the interior are also sufficient to influence Shanghai. The rice problem exists not only in Shanghai, which is surrounded by a 60-kilometer control line, but also deeply exists in the main points, lines, and areas of the entire Central China. In terms of region, the policy should focus on the lines rather than the points, and on the areas rather than the lines. In terms of time, it should not only be a countermeasure for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in, but should also quickly establish the entire policy for this rice year. Forgetting these two points and only emphasizing the temporary nature of the countermeasures for the period when the new harvest has not yet come in is, without saying, a very serious mistake. The real situation of the rice problem in the interior requires Nanjing and Shanghai to clarify their insufficient understanding of the period when the new harvest has not yet come in.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Purchase Difficulties</h3>
<p>In Kunshan and Songjiang, I asked the cadres of the Rice Control Association's offices how they would overcome the difficulties in purchasing rice in the future. The answers I received were as follows:</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>1. Increase the purchase price. 2. Severely punish smuggling and hoarding. 3. Provide farmers with fertilizer. 4. Extend loans to purchasing merchants. 5. The Rice Control Association should start purchasing work as soon as possible. 6. The Rice Control Association should organize an armed inspection team.</p>
<h3>Songshan</h3>
<p>1. Increase the purchase price. 2. Inspect for smuggling and hoarding. 3. Implement barter trade. 4. Supply rice beyond the amount needed for civilian consumption according to the Baojia system. 5. Guarantee local security. 6. Facilitate transportation. 7. Prohibit excessive taxes and levies along the way. These answers are all very principled, formulaic, and only a request for correcting the environment that has already become common knowledge. What I wanted to hear from the Rice Control Association's offices was how the Rice Control Association and its various offices should reflect on their own powerlessness in correcting the environment. This issue was not even raised in the proposals of the joint meeting of various offices held last time, and I cannot help but feel deeply regretful. Everyone knows that before hearing the Rice Control Association's self-reflection, a portion of the outspoken press was severely criticizing the Rice Control Association. That is the argument for making personnel changes the top priority. The general public also has high expectations for the Rice Control Association, so they are disappointed and consider it natural to make personnel changes. But is making personnel changes really the main way to solve the problem? One of my purposes is to examine what the real causes of the difficulties in purchasing rice are in the interior. On this point, I cannot reach a clear conclusion. In Shanghai, no one is conducting a subjective examination of the most likely causes of the difficulties in purchasing rice, but is only listing the various causes in a flat manner and advocating for flat countermeasures. But in the interior, the people engaged in purchasing work and those responsible for guiding purchasing work unanimously say that the biggest reason for the difficulties in purchasing rice since the establishment of the Rice Control Association is the delay in starting purchasing work. In other words, the main reason is not the unsoundness of the personnel or the lack of smooth operation after the establishment of the Rice Control Association, but the delay in deciding on policies and the stagnation in establishing new institutions before the establishment of the Rice Control Association. Therefore, the argument that blames the difficulties in purchasing rice on the Rice Control Association and does not demand reflection on the ideas and methods at the time of the Rice Control Association's birth is a political argument against the Rice Control Association, which is of course severely criticized in the interior.

<h3>Executive Yuan Orders Provincial and County Governments to Facilitate Rice Transport to Shanghai; City Government Designates Four Rice Storage Warehouses</h3>
<p>It has been widely rumored recently that wealthy bureaus in various places seem to be restricting the export of rice. The Rice Grain Control Committee quickly reported the situation to the Executive Yuan, requesting that the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces be instructed to facilitate rice merchants holding the committee's passports so that the Shanghai citizens' food supply could be smoothly managed. The Executive Yuan has now circulated an order to the provincial and county governments to handle this matter, so transportation is becoming more convenient every day. The first batch of rice purchased by rice merchants in Qingpu and other places arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A large number of rice transported by waterway from Wuhu has also arrived. Moreover, citizens are enthusiastically applying for temporary passports for rice shipments of more than five dou and less than ten shi, with thousands of people coming every day. Therefore, the daily arrival volume is strong, and prices are trending downward.</p>
<p>In order to ensure ample rice storage in the city and regulate the food supply for the citizens, the Shanghai Special Municipality issued a public notice yesterday (the 21st), designating the following warehouses as rice storage warehouses for the city, in accordance with Article 5 of the Shanghai Citizen Food Rice Management Temporary Regulations: Zhejiang Industrial Bank Warehouse at 970 North Suzhou Road, Bank of China Warehouse at 1040 North Suzhou Road, China Industrial Bank Warehouse at 1016 North Suzhou Road, and Maotai Warehouse at 369 Fengyang Road. The original text of the public notice is as follows: To inform the public, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Shanghai Citizen Food Rice Management Temporary Regulations, the following warehouses are designated by the government as rice storage warehouses for the city: Zhejiang Industrial Bank Warehouse, 970 North Suzhou Road; Bank of China Warehouse, 1040 North Suzhou Road; China Industrial Bank Warehouse, 1016 North Suzhou Road; Maotai Warehouse, 369 Fengyang Road.

<h3>City Government-Managed Houses Can Be Applied for Return</h3>
<p>Owners of houses in the northern part of Shanghai were mostly affected by the war and moved to other places, so all their properties were taken care of by the Allied Navy Rehabilitation Department and the Allied Residents Group, and the rent was collected on their behalf. Now, the Allied authorities have transferred 400 and 414 buildings respectively on June 16 of the 31st year and December 22 of the 32nd year, along with the rent collected over the years, to the city government for management. It is learned that the authorities, in order to sympathize with merchants and civilians, can carry their original property certificates and three copies of photos to register with the Shanghai North Office of the Land and Housing Management Committee at 27 Luofu Road (formerly Fuxing Road) at the end of Wujin Road (formerly Laobazi Road) on the fourth floor (next to the Japanese Residents Group), if the owners return to Shanghai or are in Shanghai. The office will immediately apply for the return on their behalf according to the legal procedures for return.</p>

<h3>Joint Management Office Dispatches Personnel to Investigate Cotton Cloth Rationing Stores</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Joint Management Office of Cloth Store Industry Wholesalers stated that the temporary cotton cloth rationing has already begun. However, since the matter is a new initiative and there are more than a hundred participating stores, it is feared that the procedures for rationing in various stores may not be thorough, or that the variety of patterns may be uneven, making it difficult to take care of everyone's wishes. Not only is it easy to create misunderstandings among the citizens and affect the rationing policy, but it also harms the reputation of the entire industry. Therefore, the committee of the office has decided to secretly dispatch senior staff members to the various participating stores every day to conduct investigations. If any errors are discovered, they will be corrected or warned according to their severity. However, since the office has limited personnel, the investigation may not be thorough. If there are any procedural errors or opportunistic acts by the various participating stores, we hope that the citizens will report them, or report directly to the office to correct them.</p>
<h3>Wharf Service Guidance Office Handles Registration</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly rectify wharf order and improve the safety of travelers and merchants, the Ministry of Social Welfare has promulgated the Management Regulations for Travel Service Agencies and Wharf Service Agencies, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record, and has set up a Travel and Wharf Service Guidance Office in Shanghai, specifically responsible for management and guidance matters. It is learned that in order to implement management and guidance, the office is now preparing the Registration and Licensing Measures for Travel Service Agencies and Wharf Service Agencies, and has begun handling registration procedures in conjunction with the Social Welfare Bureau. The office is now handling the registration of travel agencies, barging agencies, and other similar societies in Shanghai from today onwards in order to promote management work. In the future, anyone operating this type of business in the city must go through registration and licensing procedures, otherwise they will be banned.</p>
<h3>Police Consumer Cooperative Society to Begin Rationing Soon; Actively Procuring Various Supplies</h3>
<p>In order to increase police efficiency and improve the treatment of police officers, Deputy Commissioner Su of the Shanghai Special Municipality First Police Bureau suggested organizing a police consumer cooperative society, which was adopted by Commissioner Chen and ordered to organize, and with the support of various sectors and the advance of funds, most of it has been completed. Procurement of materials has also begun. The progress of the affairs has attracted great attention from all sectors of society. When I visited Deputy Commissioner Su to inquire yesterday, he gave a detailed answer, saying: "Since the beginning of the establishment of the society, we have received enthusiastic support from all sectors for fundraising, reaching more than 30 million yuan. The Central Reserve Bank and others have also agreed to provide timely loans, and we are very grateful for the enthusiasm of all sectors. The matter of material procurement has also begun, and most of the main materials have been procured, including more than 4,500 dan of rice, more than 200 dan of salt, more than 4,000 jin of cooking oil, more than 40,000 boxes of matches, more than 1,000 boxes of soap, as well as coal, soy sauce, tea, etc. Among them, except for rice, which is still applying for a permit to transport it back to Shanghai, all other goods have arrived at the society and are being prepared for rationing. The rationing method is based on the number of police officers and their family members, and the price will be much lower than the retail black market price. There are also cotton cloth, wool, shirts, woolen goods, etc., which are being discussed with the relevant authorities. In short, if various goods can be procured smoothly, the lives of police officers can be improved day by day in the future, and the efficiency of police administration will also increase."</p>
<h3>Items Confiscated by Road Police to Be Sold at Public Auction</h3>
<p>Items confiscated by the Road Police of the Ministry of Construction have been piled up for a long time, and there is a fear that they will be damaged. The Ministry has previously requested that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit send personnel to jointly sell them at public auction, and the application has been approved by the Executive Yuan. It has also formulated measures for handling confiscated items accumulated by the Road Police in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit, and has sent letters to the chambers of commerce of both Beijing and Shanghai to appoint two or three local impartial merchants to handle the matter together. Except for contraband and drugs, which will be transferred to the Ministry of Interior for handling, other confiscated items with fixed prices will be sold to the control or rationing agencies of the respective items at the price, regardless of the quantity. Those without fixed prices will have a floor price determined by the local chamber of commerce, reviewed jointly by the Ministry of Construction, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Audit, and sold at public auction after being advertised in the newspaper. It is heard that the Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce has selected Ding Fangyuan, Xu Wenzhao, and Zhang Dalian to be appointed by the Ministry to assist in handling the matter.</p>

<h3>Reader's Educational Assistance News: New and Returning Students Apply in the Same Way</h3>
<p>The educational assistance office is issuing application forms, counting both new and returning students. In addition to the prescribed 5% ratio, schools with a large number of sixth-term assisted students will receive a corresponding increase in forms to ensure that each school has at least enough forms to distribute to returning students (the total number should not exceed 20%). Deserving students should be given the opportunity to apply first. However, returning students whose family circumstances are acceptable, who do not need assistance, or whose academic performance is too poor to be improved should be restricted. Schools should consider these two aspects when distributing applications. Therefore, whether new or returning, students who have been refused an application form by the school should not directly request additional forms from the office.</p>
<p>Illegally Obtained Application Forms Are Useless: According to the office's records, some schools have already received their full allocation of application forms, but the schools insist that they have not. This suggests that someone has obtained them illegally. The office keeps records of all distributed application forms. Any application form that is not obtained through legal channels will not be accepted. Therefore, it is useless to obtain application forms illegally.</p>
<p>We Hope School Authorities Pay Attention: The office staff held a full meeting yesterday to review general issues regarding this term's educational assistance work and passed several resolutions. Two points are mentioned below for the information of school authorities. Please encourage schools to establish more free and half-price scholarships to help poor and outstanding students. Although Shen Bao and Xin Bao have scholarship funds, they are limited and cannot meet the demand, leading to regretful omissions. If schools can establish more free or half-price scholarships, it will be easier to raise funds and achieve broader benefits. We believe that school principals, being enthusiastic about education, will agree with this suggestion. In recent days, students have been coming to the office to complain, saying that principals are forcing impoverished students to pay tuition fees, otherwise they will not be issued, or that they are not acting fairly according to the office's regulations, giving importance to personal connections, resulting in qualified students not being able to obtain application forms. No wonder students are coming to the office to complain. It has been decided that: firstly, we hope that school principals will conduct fair reviews, without favoritism or difficulty. Education is a matter of conscience, different from general commercial situations; secondly, we hope that students will truthfully report any unreasonable or unfair situations that occur. This newspaper will investigate and take appropriate action.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Economic Bureau of the Shanghai Special Municipality</h3>
<p>— Jing Zi No. 16</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that this Bureau previously issued orders to assist the National Commercial Federation in handling the temporary distribution of cotton cloth. All procedures are determined by the Commercial Control Council, and this Bureau only distributes purchase certificates to the citizens of this city. All residents of this city, except for newborns, are able to receive one purchase certificate to buy 1.5 zhang of cotton cloth from designated retailers. However, recently, citizens have reported that the retailers display a limited selection of patterns and insufficient lengths. Furthermore, if one asks to exchange or select, they often make excuses that there is no stock, and even use harsh words. Such a situation is truly abhorrent. In addition to sending a letter to the Commercial Control Council to strictly order all retailers to display samples as publicly as possible and allow people to choose and purchase, and to promptly correct the poor attitude of the clerks, if the people of this city find that the cotton cloth purchased is of insufficient length or damaged, they should report it immediately to this Bureau or the Economic Security Section of the First Police Station or the Second Police Station, or the National Commercial Control Council. Once verified, they will be punished according to law without leniency. This notice is hereby issued.</p>

<h3>National Discussion: The Plight of Retail Cloth Shops</h3>
<p>— Chen Chuben</p>
<p>The term "retail cloth shop" implies that it is the smallest and least capitalized type of cloth business. These shops are typically located in the Nanyang Bridge area and along Connaught Road in western Shanghai. In the past, their business involved collecting leftover and defective cloth from various cloth factories and selling it to customers in rural areas. Their operations were essentially a low-profit venture serving the impoverished. Last year, when the National Government purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth, including remnants, in support of national policy, these shops had to apply to the Commercial Control Council to release all their goods. Since then, they have been passively depleting their resources and are now facing a dead end. Larger cloth businesses with more capital have already switched to other businesses. Retail cloth shops, with their small capital, have no funds to change businesses and can only wait for their demise.</p>
<p>This temporary allocation of cotton cloth is handled by the Cloth Shops Joint Operations Office. The total number of cloth purchase certificates is over 300,000. The quantity of cloth distributed to retailers is not specified. Retail cloth shops, with their small scale, limited capital, and insignificant influence, are nominally listed as retailers, but in reality, they only receive several hundred to over a thousand certificates. The goods allocated to them are based entirely on their retained goods and existing inventory, with no new cloth supplied from outside. The goods stocked by retail cloth shops are originally affordable and durable goods for the common people. In addition, the retained goods are remnants, which are remnants accumulated over the years, with varying lengths and colors that may be out of fashion. Therefore, this allocation is bound to be difficult, causing dissatisfaction and unjustly blaming retail cloth shops. In reality, retail cloth shops have inherent deficiencies and have no goods to exchange, nor do they acquire inferior goods.</p>
<p>The distribution area for this cloth purchase certificate also seems inappropriate. The goods stocked by retail cloth shops are mostly economical and durable types, such as Yuanjiu patterns, Yuanxi cloth, etc., which are very suitable for villagers. It would be most appropriate to allocate them to villagers in Pudong. The issuing authorities, unaware of the situation, distributed them to fashionable women in this city, who found them unsuitable, so the sin of blame is added to the retail cloth shop. Retail cloth shops receive their unjust anger every day. It cannot be blamed on the issuing authorities. The joint operating office did not inform the authorities of the industry's status.</p>
<p>This temporary allocation of cloth purchase certificates is valid for six months. The number of cloth allocated to retail shops is only several hundred to over a thousand certificates. If each certificate is worth 200 yuan, the total value is only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan. Based on the current price of rice at 10,000 yuan per dan, the minimum monthly expenditure is 40,000 to 50,000 yuan, and the six-month expenditure is 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, the day the cotton cloth is sold out is the day the capital is exhausted. At that time, all retail cloth shops will be unemployed, which is probably not a blessing for society. I hope that the wise authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>I am one of the retail cloth shop owners in the cotton cloth business. I am unwilling to sit and wait for death, unwilling to endure the unwarranted anger of the landlord, and even more unwilling to be unjustly blamed by society. I am willing to give up this allocation and transfer the goods to be sold by large department stores. In this way, buyers from all walks of life, from farmers to scholars, will stand on the road and enjoy the distribution of high-quality cotton cloth. Retail cloth shops can also close down early, and the partners can disband and rejoice.</p>

<h3>Medical Assistance Fund: Our Service Four</h3>

<h3>Fuyou Orphanage Appeals for Assistance: We Can Also Collect on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage is the only institution in Nanshi that provides education and care for orphaned and destitute children. Although it was established only two years ago, it has achieved remarkable results, having taken in hundreds of beggar children and orphans. After education and care, over two hundred people have been introduced to various factories, stores, workshops, and hospitals inside and outside this city to learn skills and work. There are currently more than two hundred children still in the orphanage. However, the orphanage has no fixed funding and relies on donations from the outside world. Recently, funds have been exhausted, and supplies are difficult to obtain. If assistance is not received in a timely manner, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. We dare to appeal on their behalf, hoping that kind-hearted people will generously donate during the orphanage's fundraising period (from May 11th to June 30th, with a goal of one million yuan) so that the orphanage's education and care work will not be interrupted. If you wish to donate, we can also collect and transfer it on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Naval Painter (4)</p>
<p>"That's not necessarily the case! It's just that the painting methods cannot be the same. For example, there are also surrealist works that depict warships. Those kinds of warships are commendable, but Mr. Iwata's painting method is a bit different."</p>
<p>Duhara then said something harsh.</p>
<p>"It's okay, please don't hesitate to criticize!"</p>
<p>Ichikawa urged quickly.</p>
<p>"If I may be frank, I think it's closer to an advertising painting than a work of art."</p>
<p>"Haha, that's a bit of an over-the-top criticism! Then wouldn't my paintings also become high-priced advertising paintings?"</p>
<p>Ichikawa readily defended Takao and said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Takao listened patiently to this criticism. There were many things he wanted to say, but he endured it for the time being. After a moment, Takao asked in a trembling voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, the movers from the moving company have been waiting for too long. Can I have them send it back to me?"</p>
<p>"Oh, wait a moment, can't I keep this painting here for a few days?"</p>
<p>Ichikawa seemed to have thought of something and said this.</p>
<h3>(5)</h3>
<p>After Takao left Ichikawa's house, he felt uneasy, muddled, and dragging his wooden clogs, he ran all the way to the Ashigaru Station.</p>
<p>"One ticket to Shinbashi!"</p>
<p>He said angrily at the ticket office.</p>
<p>He didn't want to go straight back to the apartment. He ran to Ginza Street, dragged his former Parisian party colleagues, and thought of going to a tavern to drink beer.</p>
<p>(Advertising painting, what exactly is that?)</p>
<p>Sitting in the tram starting forward, he shouted this in his heart.</p>
<p>(Painting an apple is a work of art, painting a warship is an advertising painting? Don't arbitrarily judge people!)</p>
<p>His anger did not dissipate even after he changed trains at Gotanda. (I have liked the navy since I was a child, so I paint warships. I know the shortcomings of my painting, but the warships are very childish and very popular. What exactly is the reason for this?)</p>
<p>Even when he got off at Shinbashi Station, Takao was still angry.</p>
<p>(To hell with it. Let the advertising painting be an advertising painting! Even if apple painters object, I will create an advertising painting with great advertising power. If it has advertising power, then it is good art. That is a good painting. I don't care what anyone says!)</p>
<p>Thus he became the uninhibited Takao. He developed a great aversion to Tsuruhara Keiichi, and even eating him alive would not be enough to vent his hatred.</p>
<p>As he passed Shinbashi, he suddenly saw a sky densely covered with ink clouds. A cold wind blew from the Kyobashi direction, like a gloomy winter scene with the sun setting. However, Ginza Street at 5 p.m. was still very lively.</p>
<p>(Not a single good facial expression.)</p>
<p>Takao, whose anger had not yet subsided, did not have a good impression of the men and women walking on Ginza Street. He felt that all the people dressed in beautiful clothes and strutting around were like Tsuruhara Keiichi.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and walked forward through the crowd. This image of Takao was like a madman, with disheveled hair and eyes behind his glasses as if carrying blood beads, so the refined passersby on Ginza Street gave way to him.</p>
<p>Before long, he was about to turn towards the Parisian office. In the seams of the crowd on Ginza Street, he saw a man wearing a bronze suit and a gray hat, peeking at him, and suddenly rushed at Takao.</p>
<p>"Damn it, can't you see people?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>The man apologized straightforwardly, but when Takao looked at the man's face, his legs went weak and his mouth lost its agility. (104)</p>
<h3>Seeking Relatives of Guo Yundi</h3>
<p>The young girl Guo Yundi (or Gu Yundi) was abducted to Beijing in November of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to work as a prostitute. She has now been rescued by the Beijing Police Department and is temporarily staying at the Beijing Social Bureau Relief Home. Efforts are being made to locate her father, Gu Santai, and her brother, Gu De, in Shanghai. They used to live at No. 29 Bing'an Lane, Ellis Road, but have since moved, and their current whereabouts are unknown. Members of the public who know their whereabouts are requested to report it to the Children's Protection Section of the First District Public Office, or the Zhengsu Section of the First Police Station on Fuzhou Road. (Gu Yundi is a transliteration from the Beijing dialect and may not be her real name).</p>
