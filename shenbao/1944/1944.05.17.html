<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">請求政府迅速改組米統會 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我們在過去討論糧食問題的評論特別多，而對於米統會的批評又特別嚴，實在因為糧食問題太嚴重了。我們始終感覺民生不能安定，則一切政策政令得不到順利推行的保證，而糧食問題不能解決，則民生得不到最低限度安定的保證。視之嚴重就言之痛切。當然，我們的嚴格批評，在語整個機構與全部人事，而絕不是對於某某個人的問題。換句話說，我們批評的對象，是公眾的利益，而不是一人一事的好惡。我們重視糧政機構與人事，認為不能放鬆的。然而可惜得很，就是嚴格的批評，並未得到米統會當局的重視與採納。</p>
<p>米糧統制，在制度，方式以及人事上言，其重要性實不亞謚米糧的增產，如果統制的方式不良，人事不健全，就是有了增的的效果，也是無用。況且，增產就是統制中積極目的，統制而失販，就根本不會有增產的可能呢！</p>
<p>米統會成立以後的工作經過，無可緯言的是失敗了。可是，米糧問題的挽救危機已經迫在眉睫，再不能因循坐誤了。痛定恩痛，認識苦痛的經驗，立刻予以澈底改組，一新面目的時機，今天的負責當局，就不能不迅起把握。</p>
<p>就米統會人事方面言，原係委員制，可是，若于委員徒負形式上的名義，而不負實際上的責任，甚且對於該會的內容也有不甚明瞭者。因此，有重要措施而並未取得各委員同意者，嚴格的說，不是委員的濫竽充數，就是當局的擅自處理。米新會主任委員，僅僅有資望，人格好是不够積極的，一定要精明幹練，一定有堅定生張，有剛果决斷。其次，来統會秘書長，輔佐主任委員，地位與責任罪常重要，其人選條件，資望人格固然必備，而才幹與精神尤不可少，决不是僅僅會說幾句日木語言就可以勝任的。其餘高級幹部職員，至少有一半對於米糧事務，是內行的。聽說有學騐膚淺的卅歲左右的人，有了特殊的關係，就擔任視察工作，月支薪水萬金左右。實際做事的新興機構，形成了暮氣的官僚機關。至於盟邦人士參加工作者，勤懇負資的熱情，固足稱道，但也是外行者居多，且不能深切瞭解不能適合中國國情民情，而又堅持自己成見。</p>
<p>就米統會收買價格而言，共初規定每石七八百元，就當時市便尙屬可能，但却忘了物價的波動，去年的種籽肥料人工，與現在此較相差幾許，因此收買價格自然也不能一成不變。所以，無法使農民願意賣出，發生許多糾紛流弊，一般地方不肖之徒，從而利用機會，擾害人民者更是不少。</p>
<p>過去糧食部時代的政策與辦法，未始不良，就因爲人事問題陷於失敗。於是籌劃米統會，以代糧食部，可是，也因爲人事問題而趨於失敗。不過，現在時機已迫，不必再以第三個替代。所以，我們主張就米統會加以澈底的改造。</p>
<p>人事刷新，使之健全爲第一義，起用有資望人格，精明幹練，剛果決斷，富於經騐，勇於負責的人才。對於屬員工作嚴密監　，尤須賞罰嚴明。現在米統會當局及各高級職員。如果自問過去工作並無成績，今後工作無把握做好，那末，還是及早退讓賢路。如果自己做不好而偏偏　棧，不智孰甚。居了名養，必須負責，掛名委員而不負實際責任者，亦應辭職。其餘　員，均予解職。</p>
<p>軍米的中要性，戰時更應重視，不能减量，不能誤時，應由中央政府負責，資成米統會專做收買軍米工作·同時，希望盟邦當局信賴中國政府單獨負資辦理，使收買事權一元化·以專責任，收買價格與方式，在在顧到農民利益，使之願意賣出。</p>
<p>米統會現有各地辦事處及大多數採辦商，就過去經騐言，都是無濟於事而徒耗公帑，應即全部撤銷。實施收買工作，應會同縣地方政府視當地實際產量酌定收買數量，取得各當地政府及正當米商充分協力。米統會居於收買軍米的中央輿地方間統制機稱的地位，且爲防止弊竇，中央政府應指派幹員廉吏，馳赴各地視察，明查暗訪兼施，凡辨理具有成績奢，給予獎勵，如有作弊者，依戰時條例論罪。</p>
<p>各省市　要米糧，收買統制配洽等工作，由各省市翠獨自辦，而與米統會取得聯絡關係，使收買價格一致，收買數量合理。</p>
<p>收買價格，以願到農民成本加以合理利潤爲原則，並須隨市價而變動，絕對不能脫離現實而一成不變，使農民視賣出米糧爲畏途。</p>
<p>最後，我們顧以最誠懇的熊度敬吿身負責任的各機關當局，明知本身職務的工作已經失敗，而無勇氣加以革新，應知急流勇退，保全令譽，如果束手無策，坐以貽誤，對機關對自己都非辦法。米統會如此，其他機關亦然。</p>

<p>南京十六日中央社電　行政院十六自舉行第二〇九此會議，甲，報告事項，院長報告，據建設部呈以據郵政局駐滬辦事處呈，請再予增加國內郵費，以便調整郵政經濟，抄附原件，轉請鑒核等情到院，經核尙無不合，已呈請中政會核示。院長報吿，據宣傳部呈送中央電訊社組織掌程修正草案及修正意見，請鑒核備案等情到院，核尙可行，已令准備案。乙，討論事項，院長交議，擬將本院各部駐滬辦事處於本年五月底一律結束，所有人員由各該部自行設法安　或遺散，至原有各辦事處經費，仍准各該部留用，但必須將用途呈核，請公決案，決議通過，並呈報中政會及國府備案。院長交議，據內政部梅部長呈，擬其省行政機構改革方案一案，經先飭據梅部長等各員審查，並由蘇。浙，皖。進四省府簽註意見，請公決案，決護照審查意見通過，由院令先行公布，並呈中政會。院長交議，關於省行政機構改革方案第三項，並得適用於各特別市，請公決案，决議通過，並呈報中政會。院長交議，擬將各特別市糧食局裁撤，其事務歸併於經濟局辦理，請公决案，决議通過，並呈報中政會及國府備案。院長交議，據社會福利部丁部長呈，爲擬其戰時國民宴會限制綱要革案，請鑒核等情，請公决案，决議通過，呈中政會。丙，任免事項，院長提，據物資統制審議委員會周兼委員長呈，該會廣東分會委員長陳耀祖出確，擬請派陳春圃爲物資統制審議委員會區東分會委員長案，决議通過。</p>
<h3 id="c3">省行政機構改革案 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　還都以後之省政機構，原採用委員制度，其後因鑒於委員制不能充分發揮行政效率？乃於上年改爲省長制，以便集中事權，加强行政效率。各省之下除政務·財政。建設·敎育四廳外，更視環境需要設　警務·　安·宣傳·衛生·封鎖管理等處及經濟·糧食·社會福利·淸鄉事務等局，以專責推進各種事務。惟今當大東亞戰爭決戰階段，欲適應環境，加强行政效能，非力謀簡素化不可，政府當局有鑒於此，乃有調整省政機構之戰，已於十六日行政院第二〇九次會議決議通過，即將各省之衛生，宣傳兩處及經濟·糧食·社會福利三局，予以裁撤，所有事務，分别併於政務·建設等躍辦理，地方行政機稱，經此次改革後，以往廳處尙行文施政之紛岐抵觸遲緩之弊，當可免除。省長事權，亦因此得以完全集中，而發揮高度之行政效率，茲悲省行政機構改革力案于後。</p>
<p>省政府實行合署辦公，甲，省長之事權，完全集中於省長，省對中央各部及對縣之行文，完全以省長之名議行之。乙，省政府之各廳處局，視同中央各部之各司，其廳處局長，純粹爲省長之幕僚，中央各部不得對共主管之廳處局（例如內政部對警務處）行文，廳處局亦不得對其主管之縣局（例如警務處對縣警察局）行文，廳處局之印信，即由省府繳銷之。丙，各廳處局辦公室，應設法集合於省政府，即一時不能集合辦公，但亦不得延遲以上甲乙二項之實施。</p>
<p>省政府各處局之　倂，甲，裁撤經濟局，　食局，將其十五歸併於　設廳。乙，戴撤社會福利局，宣傳處，衛土處，將其事務歸併於政務廳。丙，栽併於政務應及建設廳之分科規則，由省長另行核定之。丁，其餘比較閑散之附屬機關，省長得斟　情形，儘量誠併。（附註）以上一二兩項原則實施時，省政府組織法及其他關係法令，在暫時無庸修改，俟實施半年後，將關係法令同時一併調整。</p>
<p>中央對省行政之監督及指導，甲，省政府所辦事項，依法慼經中央核定者，須逕咨主管部核辦。乙，省政府每半年之施政方針運同收支概算，須於實施二個月前，三十三年下半年度，得於六月十五日前呈送行政院，由院交付各主管部會同審查，提經行政院會議核定之。丙，省政府每個月須將各項施政情形編製詳細工作報吿，於次月十五日前呈送行政院，由院交付其主管部審查之。主管部認為失當時，得依法糾正之。丁，省席收支情形，須於每三個月具報於財政部，以備查考。</p>
<p>行政督察專員制度之調發，甲·行政督察專員，應普遞設置，每行政督察區以三縣至七縣爲原則·乙·行致督察專員不得兼任縣長。丙·行政督察專員，由中央直接任免之。丁·行政賢察專員公署經費，由省庫支給之。戊·行政督察專員，承中央之命，視察地方行政，並承政府之命，督導及糾察各縣縣政之推行，但不得直接自行辦理各項事業，其受省政府之特別委託者，不在此限·已·省縣間行文，不經由行政督察專員公署承轉，但省對縣有所命令時，須同時令知行政督察專員。縣長對省有所呈報或請示時，亦須間時呈報行政督察專員。其詳細辦法另定之。庚。行政獨察專員每月至少須巡視各縣一次，每月須將所轄各縣行政狀況及視察情形，分別報告於省政府內政部及其他各主管部。辛·行政督察專員公署與內政部及其他各部，得直</p>
<h3 id="c4">河南作戰失利　渝益陷困境 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>南京十六日中央社電　此次河南作戰進展之迅速，頓使渝方發生種種困難問題，同時更使渝方對內對外立場益呈破局。，蓋湯恩伯軍之慘敗，雖可謂局部之敗戰，但今日就渝方在軍事上之抗戰能力而觀，其能否成爲反軸心陣營之一翼，此實有從根本上加以再撿討之必要。蓋此次日軍在河南作戰之勝利，實使英天對渝方之態度益爲冷淡，渝方今雖藉口武器援助不足，希圖卸其責任，但英美犧性他國從事戰爭，更為徹底調整國其關係，用盡其一切之宣傳謀略，由於此次敗戰，渝方己不能組成所謂民主之抗戰體制。另一方面，英美所企圖者，原在調整國共關係，此次作戰展開後，此種行動似益活躍，而英終極之目標，實有一中野望，乃欲使素受相當訓練之殖民地軍配置於中國戰綫，據最近情報所傳，國共關係再度調整之動向，表而上似係由渝方自主活動，實則渝方已爲英美强迫，不能動彈，是則此種動向僅爲附隨戰局進展而來之糊塗策謀而已。此種動向，吾人在本質上雖未能加以確斷，但英美對渝方之發言權，將因渝軍此次敗戰而益見增大，此種趨勢與渝方內部在政治上之對立抗爭，實有其錯綜微妙之關係，今日此種關係其對渝方地位之影響，勢將難免。最近各方會發生一稱議論，即對渝方之三民主義是否爲民主主義表示懷發。此種議論已予英美與輸以極　烈之刺激。同時，此種護論更足以反映今日渝方內部在政治潮流中有二個對立，此即自由主義與反民主之國家主義之對立，英美認此爲主義之對立，但此實爲抗戰七年之歷史上對東洋命運所表現之一種反省，面對英美式之帝國主養漸次表示反惑。由此而觀、渝方屈服於調整國共之今日，即爲渝方無從收拾時局之日，在此種混　狀態中，渝方所走之途徑、只足大東亞淪爲英美之殖民地。由中日事變發展而爲大東亞戰爭，在此而失去名目，同時更使渝方增加一種新之苦悶。由此而觀，此次作戰之進展，實已使渝方放棄其遠交近攻主義，而陷於極度困難之苦境。</p>

<p>柏林十六日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員沃爾培稱：全世界人士咸在詢問攻歐將於何時實行，各國報章亦皆在期待「此日」，實則合人已在遭遇進攻之中。目前反軸心國對西歐之空中攻勢，幷不能調爲進攻前之準備，而係其行動之一部份，蓋進攻非一時所能立就，須作通盤籌算始可奏效。如在義南之大戰，即具有羣制作用，行其調虎離山之計，故亦僅能視為大舉進攻之一環而已。此次敵軍登陸計劃，當與狄埃浦（Dieppe）全不相同，必以大規模行動爲之，或先派傘兵數師在德軍後方降陸，同時或將派眾隊在挪威。比斯開灣。薩洛尼加。希里哥蘭報等地　擾，以收聲東擊西之效。德軍司令部深知其進攻決不發動於一日或一週之內，或將延長至數月，以便　最可予以決定打繫之地點，故其進攻決不限於一地，否則義大利之大戰，當已能博得斯達林之滿意。是以德軍料其必在多方面發動，但不論前方與後方，德軍均有充分準備與之周旋</p>

<h3 id="c18">防空本部修改　燈火管制辦法　炎夏季節改採遮掩光源方法 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>市民防空本部當局，關於修改燈火管制辦法，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>查關於燈火管制事宜，業經上海陸海軍防空司令部於本月十六日頒發第二十二號吿示，將前定燈火管制辦法之一部份，加以修改。其目的在一面使平時之業務，得以　續辦理，一面無論何時，聞得發戒管制，或空襲管制警報時，能迅速準備，以防萬一，又使燈光不至向上散射，以防止敵方之企圖於未然。務望市民對於修正辦法，深切注意，一體遵守毋違。</p>
<p>路燈增光遮掩光源</p>
<p>就此次修正之辦法而論，從前規定路面每十平方公尺內，路燈僅準以三支光爲限，現在按照新規定，可改爲五支光，光度比前加大七成左右，俾街道上亦可稍增光亮。其次關於屋內之燈火，依照新規定，祗須將光源（即燈泡之類）用黑冪掩遮，即可使屋內光綫，不致經由窗戶向外洩露，所謂遮掩光源者，即懸掛黑幕，以隔斷燈光直接外洩，所謂隱蔽光源者，即縣掛黑冪，使直接燈光，不致經由任何孔隙外洩。倘燈光不自屋外直接望見，則不必將窗帘下垂，即窗戶亦不妨開啓。所慼特別注意者，爲應將天窗等處，妥爲遮蔽，勿使光綫向上洩漏，此層爲防空司令部所隨時關心不置者。此外燈光自鏡面反射，亦作爲光源直接發光而論，故鏡面若不妥爲遮掩，當以達反燈火管制辦法而論。</p>
<p>屋內燈光準用支數</p>
<p>屋內面積每約長六尺闊四尺者，準用燈光以十支光爲限，如屋內面積每長闊各十八呎者可用五十支左右之燈光。又一燈之最大光度以七十五支光爲限，即相當寬敞之房屋，照每三平方公尺得用十支光計算，可點七十五支光之燈泡數只，是其明亮程度當與平常無異，但就防空之理由與節省電流而論，市民務須改用光度較小之燈泡。</p>
<p>燈火管制分三階段</p>
<p>時趨炎夏，窗戶上縣褂防空暗幕，殊感悶熱，市民一時大異掀開暗幕，致使窗內燈光外洩，而致違章者比比皆是。現在市民如能照上文所述辦法，設法使燈光不直接外射，可不必將窗帘下垂，以免夏夜苦熱。但此一辦法政適用於管通防空時期內，遇發出警戒或空襲警報時，仍應格遵以前公布燈火管制第一號布吿所定各項辦法，女愼辦理，希市民平時準備妥善，一聞警戒警報，立將暗幕遮沒窗戶。本月九日防空日下午八時半至十時半，舉行警戒燈火管制訓練時，市民誤以其時所慼遵守之燈火管制辦法與本年三月三日以來所施行之通常燈火管制辦法，並無分別者，不乏其人。須知燈火管制分爲三個階段，即通常管制，譽戒管制，及空襲管制。現時通常管制辦法，業經鋒改，但警戒警報與空襲譽報，仍照向例辦理，市民務須了解此項區別，遵守規章，熟習管制，一遇醫戒警報或空襲警報，立即妥善處置，忽稍玩忽。倘有故意違犯情事，決予從嚴處罰，如對於規章有不明瞭處，可向市民防空本部詢問，當充分指導。</p>

<p>市宣傳處，於昨（十六日）下午二時，在市政府會議室舉行第十四次記者例會，出席各報社記者各機關代表十餘人，茲誌各報提問　各機關解答如左：</p>
<p>戶　米問</p>
<p>申報社問：戶口米配給一再延期，米價復趨激漲，未知當局有何補救辦法，以安民生？</p>
<p>糧食局答：關於本問題，本局暨有關機關，正在妥籌各種方法，疏通來源，對於收購運輸，務求妥善改進，則戶口米之配給，當河無延期之處突。</p>
<p>劣質三號麵粉</p>
<p>華日報社問：最近兩期所配給之三號戶口麵粉，大部份爲麩皮，質地粗劣，不能食用，是否配給時即如此，抑或經售</p>
<p>糧食局答：本局所配給之麵粉，均係上海區粉麩統配處所領來，加以分配，此次配給之三號麵粉，於領來時即屬如此。</p>
<p>購布證定期分發</p>
<p>中華日報社問：木市棉布臨時配給，日期一再拖延，請問究將在何日配給，如尚不能有確定日期，其原因安在？</p>
<p>經濟局答：查棉布臨時配給，全國商業統制總會，業將購布證交由本局分發各區公署具領，茲本局已通令各區公署于本月二十日起至三十一日止爲發證日期，一俟各市民均領到該項購布證後，即公告普遍發售。</p>

<p>— 彬</p>
<p>昨天市政諮詢委員會舉行第一次全體委員會議，本人參與其間，復就所感，抒述如次：</p>
<p>全體委負會議，原規定每月舉行一次，本月一日巳有第一次會議之舉行，這次係臨時召集，除通過會章外，最主要者爲討論本市民食問題。市政當局對於民食問題極爲重視與關心，現已擬有安定方策，逐漸實施。同時，取得盟邦當局充分協力，更希望得到諮訽委員以及市民之瞭解與協力。我認爲民食問題固然嚴重，但當局既已定有處理方策，不久即可實現，因此，希望市民稍可安心。</p>
<p>這次會議，出席委員中，負地方碩望之顏惠慶先生翩然蒞止，很是慶幸。其實，地方事情，是每一個住居上海的市民都有同樣責任，尤其是負有資望的地方領導人士，更不可逃避貴任。所可惜的，在此社會　隍之際，有資望有力量的領導人士，仍多熱情於暴利主義，或惟求自身事業的發展。而對於地方公衆事件的貴任感仍未惑興趣。希望能够深切反省，地方幸甚，市民公益幸甚。</p>
<p>此次通過之諮詢會會章中，有設置市民意見箱一條，當然，這是給與市民表達意見的園地，希望市民充分加以利用，對於市政上人事上一切改革意見，充分賈獻。認爲不足時，並可與諮詢委員個別通信或面談。期望市政好的立即興辦，不好的立即革新，相信這是市政當局最盼望也最願推動的。不過，最緊要的，市民表示意見，必須本於忠實，大公無私。如果匿名攻訐，則是無聊行動，不會有效的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Requesting the Government to Swiftly Reorganize the Rice Control Commission <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We have had particularly numerous commentaries on food issues in the past, and the criticism of the Rice Control Commission has been particularly severe, precisely because the food problem is so serious. We have always felt that if people's livelihood cannot be stabilized, there is no guarantee that all policies and decrees can be smoothly implemented, and if the food problem cannot be solved, there is no guarantee that people's livelihood can be stabilized to a minimum extent. The more seriously we view it, the more earnestly we speak about it. Of course, our strict criticisms are aimed at the entire institution and all personnel, and are by no means directed at any particular individual. In other words, the object of our criticism is the public interest, not personal likes or dislikes. We attach importance to food administration agencies and personnel, believing that they cannot be relaxed. However, it is very regrettable that strict criticisms have not been valued and adopted by the authorities of the Rice Control Commission.</p>
<p>Regarding rice control, in terms of system, method, and personnel, its importance is no less than increasing rice production. If the control methods are poor and the personnel are unsound, even if there are increased production effects, they will be useless. Moreover, increased production is the active goal of control. If control fails, there will be no possibility of increased production at all!</p>
<p>The work process after the establishment of the Rice Control Commission has undeniably been a failure. However, the crisis of saving the rice and food problem is already imminent and cannot be delayed any longer. Learning from painful experiences and recognizing the pain, the opportunity to immediately and thoroughly reorganize and present a new image must be seized by the responsible authorities today.</p>
<p>In terms of personnel of the Rice Control Commission, it was originally a committee system. However, some committee members only have nominal titles in form without bearing actual responsibility, and even do not have a thorough understanding of the content of the commission. Therefore, if important measures have not been agreed upon by all committee members, strictly speaking, it is either the committee members are holding positions without real ability, or the authorities are handling things arbitrarily. The chairman of the Rice Control Commission is not only required to have qualifications and good character, but also to be active, astute, and capable, with firm advocacy and decisive judgment. Secondly, the Secretary-General of the Rice Control Commission, who assists the chairman, holds a very important position and responsibility. The selection criteria require not only qualifications and character, but also talent and spirit. It is by no means that someone can be competent simply by speaking a few words of Japanese. At least half of the remaining senior executives and staff are experts in rice and food affairs. It is said that some people around the age of thirty with shallow experience have taken on inspection work with special connections, receiving a monthly salary of around ten thousand gold. The practical and energetic new agency has formed a bureaucratic organ with an air of stagnation. As for the Allied personnel who participate in the work, their diligence and enthusiasm are commendable, but most of them are also laymen, and they cannot deeply understand or adapt to China's national conditions and public sentiments, and they insist on their own prejudices.</p>
<p>Regarding the purchase price of the Rice Control Commission, the initial regulation was 700 to 800 yuan per stone, which was still possible at the market price at the time, but it forgot the fluctuations in prices. How much difference is there between the seeds, fertilizers, and labor costs of last year and now? Therefore, the purchase price naturally cannot remain unchanged. Therefore, it is impossible to make farmers willing to sell, and many disputes and malpractices occur. Many unscrupulous people in general places take the opportunity to disturb the people.</p>
<p>The policies and methods of the former Ministry of Food were not necessarily bad, but they failed due to personnel issues. Therefore, the Rice Control Commission was planned to replace the Ministry of Food, but it also failed due to personnel issues. However, the time is now pressing, and there is no need to find a third replacement. Therefore, we advocate thoroughly reforming the Rice Control Commission.</p>
<p>Refreshing the personnel and making it sound is the first priority, employing talented people with qualifications, character, astute and capable, decisive, experienced, and courageous to take responsibility. Strict supervision of the work of subordinates is necessary, and rewards and punishments must be clear. If the current authorities and senior officials of the Rice Control Commission ask themselves whether they have achieved any results in the past and are not confident in doing a good job in the future, then they should retire early and make way for the capable. If they cannot do it well themselves but insist on occupying the position, what could be more unwise? Those who hold a title must be responsible, and those who are nominal committee members without actual responsibility should also resign. All other superfluous staff members should be dismissed.</p>
<p>The importance of military rice should be valued even more during wartime. The quantity cannot be reduced, and the timing cannot be missed. The central government should be responsible for making the Rice Control Commission specialize in the purchase of military rice. At the same time, it is hoped that the Allied authorities will trust the Chinese government to handle it independently, so that the authority to purchase is unified, and responsibility is centralized. The purchase price and methods should take into account the interests of farmers, so that they are willing to sell.</p>
<p>The existing offices and most purchasing merchants of the Rice Control Commission in various places have been ineffective and wasteful of public funds based on past experience, and should be completely abolished immediately. To implement the purchase work, the local government of the county should determine the purchase quantity based on the actual local output and obtain the full cooperation of the local government and legitimate rice merchants. The Rice Control Commission occupies the position of a central and local control mechanism for purchasing military rice, and to prevent malpractices, the central government should appoint cadres and incorruptible officials to go to various places for inspection, combining overt investigation and covert visits. Those who have achieved results in their work should be rewarded, and those who commit fraud should be punished according to wartime regulations.</p>
<p>The purchase, control, and allocation of major rice and food supplies in various provinces and cities should be handled independently by each province and city, and contact should be maintained with the Rice Control Commission to ensure consistent purchase prices and reasonable purchase quantities.</p>
<p>The purchase price should be based on the farmer's cost plus a reasonable profit, and it must fluctuate with the market price. It must not be divorced from reality and remain unchanged, making farmers regard selling rice as a daunting task.</p>
<p>Finally, we sincerely urge the responsible authorities of various agencies to know that their own work has failed, and if they do not have the courage to reform, they should know to retreat bravely and preserve their reputation. If they are helpless and sit back and delay, it is not a good solution for the agency or for themselves. This is true for the Rice Control Commission, and it is also true for other agencies.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) After the return to the capital, the provincial government institutions originally adopted a committee system. Later, in view of the fact that the committee system could not fully exert administrative efficiency, it was changed to a provincial governor system last year in order to concentrate power and strengthen administrative efficiency. Under each province, in addition to the four departments of political affairs, finance, construction, and education, police affairs, security, propaganda, health, and blockade management offices, as well as economic, food, and social welfare bureaus, and Qingxiang affairs bureaus, are set up according to environmental needs to be specifically responsible for promoting various affairs. However, now that we are in the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, in order to adapt to the environment and strengthen administrative efficiency, we must strive for simplification. The government authorities, in view of this, have a battle to adjust the provincial government institutions, which was passed by resolution at the 209th meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 16th. The health and propaganda offices and the economic, food, and social welfare bureaus of various provinces will be abolished, and all affairs will be merged into the political affairs and construction departments. After this reform of the local administrative institutions, the past problems of divisions and conflicts in the administration of departments and bureaus can be avoided. The provincial governor's powers can therefore be fully concentrated, and high administrative efficiency can be exerted. The reform plan for provincial administrative institutions is attached below.</p>
<p>Provincial governments shall implement joint offices. A. The power of the provincial governor shall be completely concentrated in the provincial governor. The documents sent by the province to the central ministries and to the counties shall be issued in the name of the provincial governor. B. The various departments and bureaus of the provincial government shall be regarded as the various divisions of the central ministries. The heads of the departments and bureaus are purely the staff of the provincial governor. The central ministries shall not send documents to the departments and bureaus under their jurisdiction (such as the Ministry of the Interior to the Police Affairs Department), and the departments and bureaus shall not send documents to the county bureaus under their jurisdiction (such as the Police Affairs Department to the county police bureau). The seals of the departments and bureaus shall be confiscated by the provincial government. C. The offices of the various departments and bureaus shall be gathered in the provincial government. Even if they cannot be gathered for office at one time, the implementation of the above two items A and B shall not be delayed.</p>
<p>The merger of various departments and bureaus of the provincial government: A. Abolish the Economic Bureau and the Food Bureau, and merge their affairs into the Construction Department. B. Abolish the Social Welfare Bureau, the Propaganda Office, and the Health Office, and merge their affairs into the Political Affairs Department. C. The rules for dividing the departments and bureaus merged into the Political Affairs Department and the Construction Department shall be separately approved by the Provincial Governor. D. The Provincial Governor may consider the situation and merge as much as possible other relatively idle affiliated institutions. (Note) When implementing the above two principles, there is no need to modify the Provincial Government Organization Law and other related laws for the time being. After half a year of implementation, the related laws will be adjusted at the same time.</p>
<p>The central government's supervision and guidance of provincial administration: A. Matters handled by the provincial government that have been approved by the central government in accordance with the law must be consulted with the competent department for handling. B. The provincial government's policy guidelines and revenue and expenditure estimates for each half year must be submitted to the Executive Yuan two months before implementation. For the second half of the 33rd year, they must be submitted to the Executive Yuan before June 15, and the Yuan will submit them to the competent departments for joint review and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval. C. The provincial government must compile detailed work reports on various administrative situations every month and submit them to the Executive Yuan before the 15th of the following month, and the Yuan will submit them to the competent department for review. If the competent department considers it inappropriate, it may correct it in accordance with the law. D. The provincial government's revenue and expenditure situation must be reported to the Ministry of Finance every three months for reference.</p>
<p>Adjustment of the system of administrative supervisors: A. Administrative supervisors should be universally set up, with each administrative supervisory area based on three to seven counties as a principle. B. Administrative supervisors shall not concurrently serve as county magistrates. C. Administrative supervisors shall be directly appointed and removed by the central government. D. The expenses of the administrative supervisor's office shall be paid by the provincial treasury. E. Administrative supervisors, under the order of the central government, inspect local administration, and under the order of the government, supervise and correct the implementation of county administration, but shall not directly handle various undertakings on their own. This shall not apply to those who have been specially entrusted by the provincial government. F. Documents between the province and the county shall not be transferred through the administrative supervisor's office, but when the province issues orders to the county, it must simultaneously inform the administrative supervisor. When the county magistrate reports or requests instructions to the province, he must also simultaneously report to the administrative supervisor. The detailed method shall be determined separately. G. Administrative supervisors must inspect each county at least once a month, and must report the administrative conditions and inspection situations of each county under their jurisdiction to the provincial government, the Ministry of the Interior, and other competent ministries every month. H. The administrative supervisor's office and the Ministry of the Interior and other ministries may communicate directly</p>
<h3 id="e4">Failure in the Henan Operation: Chongqing Increasingly Trapped in a Difficult Situation <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The rapid progress of the current Henan operation has suddenly caused various difficult problems for Chongqing, and at the same time, Chongqing's internal and external positions have become more and more untenable. Although the disastrous defeat of Tang Enbo's army can be said to be a local defeat, from the perspective of Chongqing's military resistance capability today, it is necessary to fundamentally re-examine whether it can become a wing of the anti-Axis camp. The victory of the Japanese army in the Henan operation has actually made Britain's attitude towards Chongqing increasingly indifferent. Although Chongqing is now using the excuse of insufficient weapon assistance to try to shirk its responsibility, Britain and the United States sacrifice other countries to engage in war, more thoroughly adjust their relationship with the country, and use all their propaganda strategies. Due to this defeat, Chongqing has been unable to form a so-called democratic resistance system. On the other hand, what Britain and the United States are trying to do is to adjust the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. After the start of this operation, this kind of action seems to be more active, and Britain's ultimate goal is to make the colonial army, which has received considerable training, deployed on the Chinese front. According to recent intelligence reports, the trend of readjusting the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party seems to be an independent activity of Chongqing on the surface, but in fact Chongqing has been forced by Britain and the United States and cannot move. Then this trend is only a confused strategy that comes with the progress of the war. Although we have not been able to make a definite judgment on the essence of this trend, the right of Britain and the United States to speak to Chongqing will increase due to the defeat of the Chongqing army. This trend has a complex and subtle relationship with the political opposition and resistance within Chongqing. Today, the impact of this relationship on Chongqing's position will inevitably be difficult to avoid. Recently, there has been a claim that there are discussions that express doubts about whether Chongqing's Three Principles of the People is democracy. This kind of discussion has given Britain and the United States extremely strong stimuli. At the same time, this kind of protection is more than enough to reflect that there are two opposing political trends within Chongqing today, namely the opposition between liberalism and anti-democratic nationalism. Britain and the United States recognize this as an opposition of doctrines, but this is actually a kind of reflection on the fate of the East that has been manifested in the seven years of the War of Resistance, and gradually shows suspicion of the Anglo-American style of empire. From this point of view, the day when Chongqing succumbs to adjusting the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is the day when Chongqing has no way to clean up the situation. In this kind of chaotic state, the path taken by Chongqing can only make Greater East Asia a colony of Britain and the United States. The development of the Sino-Japanese Incident into the Greater East Asia War loses its name in this, and at the same time adds a new kind of distress to Chongqing. From this point of view, the progress of this operation has actually made Chongqing give up its policy of distant friendship and near attack, and has fallen into an extremely difficult situation.</p>

<p>Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The elite troops of the Japanese army on the Nujiang River took preemptive action and counterattacked the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, which was attempting to cross the Nujiang River and advance westward, and annihilated them everywhere. They are currently continuing their offensive. On the 27th of last month, the Japanese army completely defeated the main force of the enemy army, which was attempting to stir up trouble, 33 kilometers north of Tengyue. Also, on the 12th of this month, a certain unit completely repelled the enemy army crossing the river in five places between a certain place and a certain place, and also shouted with the elite troops in a certain place, and suddenly attacked the enemy army everywhere, causing them to flee.</p>
<p>Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The progress of the war situation in Bukiton is quite favorable to the Japanese army. The Japanese army advanced to the north of Sinobin, broke through the smoke screen in defiance of enemy artillery fire, destroyed dozens of enemy tanks, and defeated the main force of the attacking enemy army. On the night of the 10th, they occupied Nagurakian, 2 kilometers north of Sinobin, and the 94th highland, 2 kilometers northwest of Sinobin. Also, another main force of the Japanese army advanced to the highland (5 kilometers west of Bukiton) on the Bukiton-Mengdo Highway on the evening of the 9th, and at the same time, a unit of the Japanese army continued to mop up the remnants of the enemy from the 305th highland, 2 kilometers northwest of the highland, at dawn on the 10th. By 7:30, they occupied the highland on the north side of the highway (8 kilometers west of Bukiton) and the 551st highland, and mopped up the remnants of the enemy they encountered. Also, the enemy artillery position on the 161st highland southwest of Sinobin, under the strong pressure of the Japanese army from the right bank of the Mayu River on the north of Sinobin and the fierce attack of the Japanese army from the front of the above-mentioned highway, has begun to retreat to the highlands east of Xingai Deku.</p>

<p>Yangon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese army's offensive operation launched in Bishnupur (about 20 kilometers southwest of Imphal) has now reached its climax. The elite troops of the Japanese army have launched fierce attacks on a part of the enemy's 23rd Division and the remnants of the 17th Division from the west, south, and northwest for days, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy army. The Japanese army also cut off the Bishnupur-Silk Road and attacked Bishnupur, breaking through about 1,000 enemy troops on the 584th highland, 6 kilometers west of Bishnupur, and arrived at a location 3 kilometers outside Bishnupur. Under the barrage of enemy aircraft and enemy artillery teams, they launched hand-to-hand combat, gradually capturing the enemy's positions, and there is a tendency to break into the enemy's positions in Bishnupur in one fell swoop.</p>

Also, on the morning of the same day, dozens of enemy P51 fighter planes attacked a certain place in northern Myanmar. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately pursued them and shot down eight of them in an instant (one of which was unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return.</p>

<h3 id="e9">German Domestic Affairs Observations: The European Offensive Plan Has Begun to Act. The Major War in Southern Italy Has a Restraining Effect. <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters military correspondent Volpe said: The people of the world are all asking when the European offensive will be carried out, and newspapers of all countries are also expecting "this day." In fact, the allies are already encountering the offensive. The current anti-Axis air offensive against Western Europe cannot be described as preparation for the offensive, but is part of its actions. The offensive cannot be achieved at once, and must be planned in detail to be effective. For example, the major war in southern Italy has a restraining effect, and its plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain can only be regarded as a part of the major offensive. This time the enemy's landing plan will be completely different from Dieppe and must be carried out on a large scale, or several divisions of paratroopers will be sent to land behind the German army, and at the same time, or crowds of troops will be sent to harass Norway, the Bay of Biscay, Thessaloniki, Heligoland and other places to achieve the effect of attacking the east and west. The German command knows that its offensive will never be launched in a day or a week, or it will be extended for several months, in order to the most likely to give a decisive blow to the location, so its offensive will never be limited to one place, otherwise the major war in Italy should have won Stalin's satisfaction. Therefore, the German army expects that it will be launched in many ways, but whether in front or behind, the German army is fully prepared to deal with it.</p>

<p>Poland, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) German Happiness Agency News, according to German official announcement: The enemy army in southern Italy is still using new infantry and tank divisions to attack the German defense line. The south of Casino is the focus of the war. After the fierce battle, the German army withdrew from several mountainous areas. The German army counterattacked with other battlefields, straightened the line or blocked the gaps. Yesterday evening, German planes carried out effective bombing raids on the enemy's strongholds in Casino.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Reuters News: The Italian war has become more and more intense since last week, but it has not yet reached its peak. The Anglo-American offensive center is in the coastal mountain area and the middle area of the Liri River basin. This is where the US Fifth Army is operating, while the British Eighth Army is operating in the area north of Casino. The German army counterattacked several times in Sant'Angelo, Monte Maiolo, and Castelforte south of Casino, heavily slashing the enemy army, and has now moved west several kilometers to guard the new position. The US army's attempt to break into the German defense with a large number of tanks in the Liri River basin has been defeated. It is expected that there will be a major war here.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) Mr. Tsurumi Yusuke, a Japanese expert on the United States, recently wrote an article in the Pacific Magazine discussing American domestic politics and the Pacific counteroffensive, especially the rise of anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States. The main points are recorded as follows: There is no need for Britain and the United States to need the Soviet Union in the current European war situation more than today, but Britain and the United States are more terrified of the power of the Soviet Union than the post-war world reconstruction issue. Therefore, how to use the Soviet Union today and how to contain the Soviet Union in the future is a source of distress for Britain and the United States. The anxiety to expedite the decision of the war situation in the Pacific and the timing of forming a second front in Western Europe are of great importance.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Air Defense Headquarters Revises Blackout Regulations - Adopting Light Shielding Methods in the Hot Summer Season <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement regarding the revision of blackout regulations:</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of blackout regulations, the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued Notice No. 22 on the 16th of this month, modifying a portion of the previously established blackout regulations. The purpose is to allow peacetime operations to continue while enabling rapid preparation at any time upon hearing an alert or air raid warning, in order to prevent any eventuality, and also to prevent light from scattering upwards, so as to prevent enemy attempts before they occur. It is hoped that citizens will pay close attention to the revised measures and comply with them in full.</p>
<p>Increased Streetlight Brightness with Light Shielding</p>
<p>In terms of the revised measures, the previous regulation limited streetlights to only three units of light per ten square meters of road surface. Now, according to the new regulations, this can be changed to five units of light, increasing the brightness by about 70% compared to before, so that the streets can also be slightly brighter. Secondly, regarding indoor lighting, according to the new regulations, it is only necessary to shield the light source (i.e., light bulbs, etc.) with a black cover to prevent indoor light from leaking outwards through the windows. Shielding the light source means hanging a black curtain to block direct light from leaking out. Concealing the light source means hanging a black curtain to prevent direct light from leaking out through any gaps. If the light cannot be seen directly from outside, it is not necessary to lower the curtains, and the windows may be left open. What needs special attention is that skylights and other places should be properly shielded to prevent light from leaking upwards. The Air Defense Headquarters is constantly concerned about this matter. In addition, light reflected from mirrors is also regarded as direct light emission, so if mirrors are not properly shielded, it will be considered a violation of the blackout regulations.</p>
<p>Permitted Number of Indoor Lights</p>
<p>For every area of approximately six feet long and four feet wide indoors, ten units of light are permitted. For indoor areas that are eighteen feet long and wide, about fifty units of light can be used. The maximum brightness of one lamp is limited to seventy-five units of light, that is, for a spacious house, calculated at ten units of light per three square meters, several light bulbs of seventy-five units of light can be lit. The brightness level should be no different from normal, but for air defense reasons and to save electricity, citizens must switch to smaller light bulbs.</p>
<p>Blackout Regulations Divided into Three Stages</p>
<p>As the weather turns hot, hanging air defense dark curtains on windows is particularly stuffy. Many citizens momentarily lifted the dark curtains, causing indoor light to leak outwards, resulting in numerous violations. Now, if citizens can take measures to prevent light from shining directly outwards as described above, they do not need to lower the curtains to avoid the summer heat. However, this method is only applicable during normal air defense periods. When a warning or air raid alarm is issued, they must still strictly comply with the various measures stipulated in Blackout Regulation No. 1 previously announced and handle them carefully. During the air defense warning blackout training held on the afternoon of the 9th of this month from 8:30 PM to 10:30 PM, many citizens mistakenly believed that the blackout regulations they had to comply with at that time were no different from the normal blackout regulations implemented since March 3 of this year. It must be known that blackout regulations are divided into three stages: normal blackout, warning blackout, and air raid blackout. The current normal blackout regulations have been revised, but warning alerts and air raid alerts are still handled as usual. Citizens must understand this distinction, comply with the regulations, and become familiar with the regulations. In the event of a medical alert or air raid alert, they must immediately take appropriate measures and not be negligent in the slightest. If there are deliberate violations, severe penalties will be imposed. If there are any unclear aspects of the regulations, inquiries can be made to the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters, which will provide full guidance.</p>

<p>Economic Bureau answers: The National Commercial Control General Association has handed over the cloth purchase certificates for temporary allocation of cotton cloth to this bureau for distribution to the district public offices for collection. This bureau has now ordered each district public office to set the certificate issuance date from the 20th to the 31st of this month. Once all citizens have received the cloth purchase certificates, a public sale will be announced.</p>
<p>Police Illegality Requires Solutions</p>
<p>Zhonghua Ri Bao asks: At a time when all parties are trying to improve police treatment, at the Suzhou River bridge, whenever the lights are dim at night, police officers often take the opportunity to inspect luggage from travelers coming from the station, and there are illegal extortion situations. I hope the police authorities will pay attention to this in order to benefit merchants and travelers and rectify the atmosphere.</p>
<p>First Police Bureau answers: The poor quality of Shanghai police today is an undeniable fact, but this bureau is actively rectifying it. The police extortion situation on the Suzhou River bridge mentioned by Zhonghua Ri Bao may exist. The police department of this bureau is in charge of this matter and is trying to eliminate it. All illegal acts of police officers that are found are severely punished. Therefore, in addition to expressing gratitude to the press for their concern on this issue, we will pay extra attention to it. We also hope that in the future, if there are any illegal acts by police officers, the detailed situation will be reported to us immediately to promote the rectification of police discipline.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Impressions of Attending the Second Advisory Committee Meeting <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Advisory Committee held its first plenary meeting. Having participated in it, I would like to express my feelings as follows:</p>
<p>The plenary meeting was originally scheduled to be held once a month. The first meeting was held on the 1st of this month. This time, it was convened temporarily. In addition to passing the constitution, the most important thing was to discuss the food problem of the citizens of this city. The municipal authorities attach great importance to and are concerned about the food problem, and have now formulated stabilizing strategies to gradually implement them. At the same time, they have obtained the full cooperation of the Allied authorities, and hope to obtain the understanding and cooperation of the advisory committee members and citizens. I believe that the food problem is indeed serious, but since the authorities have already formulated handling strategies, they will be realized soon. Therefore, I hope that citizens can rest assured.</p>
<p>At this meeting, I was very happy to see Mr. Yan Huiqing, who has a great reputation in the local area, attending. In fact, local affairs are the responsibility of every citizen living in Shanghai, especially local leaders with resources and reputation, who cannot avoid their responsibilities. What is regrettable is that at this time of social crisis, many leaders with resources and power are still enthusiastic about profiteering or only seek the development of their own careers. They are still not interested in the sense of responsibility for local public affairs. I hope they can deeply reflect on this. It would be a great blessing for the local area and for the public welfare of the citizens.</p>
<p>In the advisory committee constitution passed this time, there is a clause on setting up citizen opinion boxes. Of course, this is a place for citizens to express their opinions. I hope that citizens will make full use of it and fully contribute their opinions on all reforms in municipal affairs and personnel matters. When it is considered insufficient, they can also communicate or talk face-to-face with the advisory committee members individually. It is hoped that good municipal affairs will be immediately implemented and bad ones will be immediately reformed. I believe that this is what the municipal authorities most hope for and are most willing to promote. However, the most important thing is that citizens must express their opinions in good faith, with impartiality and without selfishness. If they are anonymous attacks, it is a boring act and will not be effective.</p>
