<h3>爲完遂大東亞戰　中日應緊密團結　日派遺軍新舊總司令談話</h3>
<p>南京三日中央社電日中國派遺軍前任總司令官畑元帥及新任總司令官岡村大將，於此離任就任之時特於三日下午分別發表談話如决：</p>
<p>畑元帥離任</p>
<p>余今奉命轉職，與多年來在戰陣共苦樂之派遺軍將士及親愛之中日軍官民諸賢作別，並留幾萬英靈於曾戰山河而歸去，實感慨無量而不勝惜別之情。回顧余在任三年九個月內，其所以能以菲材擔當重任，爲遂行任務而努力邁進者，爲於聖威之下而神靈保佑，及全軍將士純忠至誠之奉公所賜，余對此衷心深表感謝，又在其間蒙中日兩國各界諸暨賜予援助，亦謹表滿腔謝意。方今世界戰局日益重大，中日兩國之須提携國結者，實無過於今日，故深望中日兩國各界人士更鞏固團結，分別發揮其全能力，爲完遂大東亞戰爭而努力邁進。岡村新總司令官素著令名，老成練達，深信必能負此重任，甚盼各方面將來多予援助。值此將與大陸山河話別東返之際，回憶前綫將士之勞苦，謹祝其武運愈益昌隆，同時並祝盟邦中國永遠繁勞，與四萬萬民衆之康寗。</p>
<p>岡村大將就任談話</p>
<p>此次被任爲中國派遣軍總司令官，拜受統率武勳赫赫之中國派遣軍重角，實不勝恐懼感激。</p>
<p>前任總司令官畑元　帥有高潔溫雅之人格，爲器識淵遠之將才，聲望著於內外，爲全軍將士所景仰而悅服，尤其大東亞戰爭以來，指導整滅在大陸之敵美勢力，夙夜辛勞，盡瘁於統帥任務，並曾親臨陣頭，攻略洛陽及柳州桂林等要衝，勅語下賜，聲譽內外，本人此次繼承畑元帥之偉跡，實深爲光榮。</p>
<p>今者世界情勢日益重大，實爲立於東亞興亡關頭之時，本職不敬，拜受重任，誓當粉身碎骨，率領全軍繼績派遣軍必勝之傳統，以全軍一體百鍊堅鋼之團結，斷然努力擊滅敵美，同時使與中國之提携愈益緊密，以期造成中日軍官民之一體完遂聖戰目的而奉應聖旨。</p>
<h3>沿黔桂鐵路日軍　近擊敗退渝軍　日空軍冒雨出動轟炸</h3>
<p>中國前綫基地三日中央社電黔桂鐵路爲廣西方面敗潰渝軍之惟一逃走路，沿此鐵路敗走之美空軍關係人員及渝第四戰區軍，正連續潰逃中，日空軍爲影響陸上日軍部隊之追擊，至對列車羣發動攻擊戰，使渝密集部隊頻於潰減，或破壞鐵橋切斷渝軍退走路。自黔桂路追擊戰開始以來，該方面之天氣，極爲惡劣，日空軍冒戰塲一帶之基雨，敢行先出動、以新偵察機出動沿鐵路各地拍攝照片，依賴偵察機對敗走渝眾部隊及列車汽車之活動，以及物資堆積地點，均作精密調查，即以此種調查報吿作爲攻擊之指針，派遣俯衝轟炸機隊出動，同時過有必要偵察時，更派遣直降機隊作低空偵察。十一月十七日十八日雨日，俯　轟炸隊以　異之低空飛行，於金城江附近對滿載人員器材之七行列車的百輛以上，加以猛炸，因之使該路切斷，該日軍航空隊獲得此大战果後，巳崇航空部隊司令官兩次獎勵。該隊其後仍不斷長驅猛炸渝軍。十一月二十九日轟炸獨山附近鐵橋，獲得二倍從來戰果之大戰果。又日軍直降繼更以單繼冒美空軍之不時跳樣活動，出動偵察敵情，並隨時實施攻擊，尤其於二十九日三十日兩日，對蝟集於南丹獨山間鐵路之渝軍大部隊反覆轟炸掃射，予以極大損害，因日軍偵察直降轟炸機隊之猛烈活躍，日黔桂鐵路潰定走之渝軍，已選受大打擊，而瀕於潰滅矣。</p>
<h3>滇桂黔美僑奉令避难　　里斯本三日中央社電據重慶電稱：美駐渝大使館，因日軍由中國東南部積極進展而感受威脅，故特通令居住於雲南省北部，廣西省西部，及貴州省東部之五十名美僑，急速避難云。渝美空国喪失基地　影響戰局重大昆明成都已遭受威脅　　中國戰綫某基地三日中央社電渝美軍在中國西南各地所有陣地，由於日軍作戰之進展，悉爲崩潰，現渝美軍已被迫向昆明成都兩基地撤退，且此等地亦已遭受重大威脅，渝美軍今後果出如何行動，實堪注目。美第十四航空部隊，以連結昆明，在桂林之沿綫爲主軸，建沿岸地域延長基地羣，企圖進襲日本本土，本年四月B29型機進駐渝地以來，此種企圖更趨積極，捷諾特雖雌作豪語，然其計劃終已失敗，故其任務之重點，今已轉於以下三點矣：（一）第二十航空部隊前衛之行動。（二）海上補給綫之破壞。（三）中國和平地區之攪亂。更較重要之使命，在策應美軍最高對日反攻戰略之太平洋西進作戰準備，中國反攻作戰工作，然日軍此次之大陸攻勢，已阻止敵軍之此種企岡，於華北·華中·華南展開雄大之進擊，完成絕對優勢之戰略能勢。同詩，因此作戰之結果，前進基地全面後退之美軍，其所負任務，悉被對閉，蒙受軍壓，因此美第十四航空部隊之存在價值，於茲完全喪失。就此可指出以下兩點：（一）因此喪失前衛之機能，第二十轟炸隊化爲孤立。（二）因前進基地之後退，接岸作戰歸於頓挫，蓋當B29型機由中國其地空襲日本本土時之危險，敵自身早已深悉，且今後日軍對渝內地基地之壓力，將益强化，乃爲必然之事，尤其最近敵軍之戰略，係圖破壞日方物心兩方之戰力，當茲敵軍積極企圖空襲日本本土之際，日軍之制壓敵軍基地，實爲日軍最痛快之打擊，關於接岸計劃之頓挫，巳使渝美軍不得不改變戰酪，故其對全役戰局之影響，實爲重大云。下村中將　抵平履新　　北京三日中央社電　日軍新任華北派遣軍最高指揮官下村中將二日下午二時西十分由空路抵任平日使館商　戰時各項施策　　北京三日中央社電　北平日本公使館二日上午十一時在公使館舉行管下公使館長會鑒，此爲楠木公使抵任以來之第一次聯席會議，席間就華北決戰能勢下各項施策之推進，作種種商討。奉行主席遺志　中國國民黨吿民眾書　　三十二年一月九日，國民政府參戰，更剴切昭示全國惟能能分担東亞的責任，乃能挽救自國之危亡，今日以前，不可虛僑傲慢，今日以後，更不容自基自棄。種多年之努力，再益之以與盟友同生共死之決意，用能收回租界，進而撤廢治外法權。我總理臨終諄前囑咐者，至此乃獲得具體之實現。綜觀二十年來，我主席操心慮患，奔走呼號，不邊寗處，所爲者何，爲水深火熱之勞苦大衆計耳！爲支離破碎之山河計耳！爲顛播震盪之東亞計耳！猶憶去年十月，中日兩國廢止基本關係條約，改訂同盟條約，前此對國家之自由與統一有所疑慮者，當已渙然冰釋，撤兵問題，復有直截了當之解決，即辛丑條約之駐兵權，亦一併廢棄。以挫敗之餘，獲此正義和平之條件，果能循是努力，則復興有自建設可期尚復何待？意者重慶方面，於此必常憬然覺醒，加以抉擇，不料開羅會議，一再受騙，因循至今，帝國主義者反顏若仇，始而者難，繼而壓迫，勢且實行其直接的宰割之第四期，擯棄之又從而宰割之矣。此無他，英美何愛於中國，愛其爲所利用供其犧牲而已。利用之程度已盡，則擯棄之何所惜，犧牲之狡計已售，則宰割之又何所靳而不爲，近頃以來，英美對渝態度，日形惡化，非具愛惡之念，有所變易，侵略者本來之猙獰面目，固如是也。嗟夫！人爲刀俎，我爲魚肉，亡一國之痛，滅種之憂，頻年以來，種種事實，固已不待煩言矣，其將熱視無睹，自淪於萬刧不復之泥犁地獄乎？抑將相與奮起，有所自拔乎？願我同胞，深長思之也。計自和平運動發足至今，艱苦挫折，不爲不多，而卒有中日同盟條約之缔結，與夫大东亚共同宣言之发表大亞洲主義之实現可期，總理歿後，我主席領導反侵略鬥爭之經緯，凡我同志，曁我同胞，所當繼本遺志，貫澈始終者又一也。　　吾人門爭愈劇前途勝利愈近　　凡前所言，俱爲二十年來對內對外鬥爭之史實。本黨一屆三中全會，接受總理遺囑宣言，鄭重中明，「吾黨全體，一致舉行總理之遺敎，不得有所創製」。我主席手訂新國民運動綱要，亦明白昭示「不另標主義」。吾人「原有三民主義以爲建設中華民國之根本」。凡我同志，曁我同胞，務和平運動之路綫，益見其光明而正確，我主席畢生盡瘁所以奉行總理遺敎，所以遺留於我國家民族者，可以無憾矣！所不能忘懷者，和平統一尚未賣現，大東亞戰爭之完遂，猶有待於努力，是则惟在後死者之者耳！此自，亦我主席繼承總理領導革命之歷程。以主席一生對國民革命之惡誠，對總理孫先生之忠誠，凡所訓示，要旨一本總理遺敎，旣使一切誤解曲解，無所用其假借，復使根本精神，隨時代之進一展，而獲得更有效之活用須仰體斯旨，遵守總理遺敎，奉行主席遺志，無二心，無歧途，勇猛精進，以底於最後成功。際此顚危苦鬥之秋，又復遭逢主席之喪，本黨同志，固當目肅自檢，全國國民，允宜自責自任，應知民族之命運，端在國民之自決，對內無自立之能力，對外即無共存之資格。以自主言。充實民力發達國力，盡其在我，以共存言，必盡應盡之義務，乃能享應享之權利。今日之事，以精誠團結爲第一要義，以完遂爭，促進統一，根絕赤禍爲第一急務。淮全黨團結而後能集中優秀之戰鬥幹部，確立革命之中心勢力，惟舉國團結，而後能護致眞正統一，消弭瓜分之危機，惟中日團結，東亞團結，而後能外抗强暴，內謀共存，而後世界和平乃得以確立，官僚制度，爲消磨革命精神，障礙民主勢力之惡菌，本黨必悉力以掃蕩之，貪污政治，爲直接擾害民生，間接製造赤禍之毒素，本黨必悉力以廓淸之。戰爭期間，生活困迫，固所難免，然游匪肆虐，破壞生產，奸商囤積，操縱居奇，苛雜盤剝，吸血吮脂，皆爲人爲的痛苦，本黨必悉力以解除之，仇鄰媚外，爲失敗主義者之奴隸根性，本黨必悉力以剷削之，和平統一爲救亡圖存之階梯，本黨必悉力以促進之，大東亞戰爭爲興華保亞之先着，本黨必悉力以完遂之，同盟條約爲中日和平之基礎，共同宣言爲東亞共榮之準則，本黨必悉力以行之，務使一字一句，見話實現，世變愈亟，吾人之鬬爭愈劇，前途之勝利愈近。回顧旣往，雖歲月不居，流光易逝，然經一度之圖爭，即有一度之進展、膽望將來，中國之目由平等，東亞之獨立解放，固已光明在望矣，其一心一德，邁力前進，共濟艱難，主席在天之靈，實式憑之。（全文完）社評應有的警惕與反省　　最近德富蘇舉先生在母日新聞寫了一篇「期望於領導階級」，他指出「領道階級」中所表現的許多不應有的現象，在中國正可以說是嚴重到極點。盟邦的政治，不論機構方面及人事方面，都要算是很上軌道了，自然遠比中國健全得多。以盟邦這樣健全的政事，德富先生尚且要不嫌百尺竿頭更進一步，撰文策勵；機構和人事缺點特多的我國，是更應该怎樣警惕反省！　　德富先生所說給人攻擊的，所謂領導階級官中的「賣職分子」，毋庸掩飾的，在中國領導階級的官吏中，能够格遵國父遺志的，當然不少，但不稱職甚至凟職的，顯然也太多。我們似可把中國領導階級官吏中不稱職的分子，分爲三種典型，有的或兼而有之。　　第一種就是「炙手可熟，氣势凌人」者。他們做事「缺乏熱誠，認眞，氣魄等精神」，可是搭起空架子來，却有凜然不可犯的氣概，所謂「做官要做得威風」，搭官架子便是他們做官的精神，試間這樣使人無法親近的人，如何能够領導人呢？更有借勢凌人的，還會做出種種爲非作歹的事情來，如有拂運們的，甚至身命財產的生殺予奪之標，也可握在他們的手裏。這一種官吏以前曾經見到過，現在也難保證絕對沒有。他們不僅失職，簡直還犯法。　　第二種就是「不顧國家祟高目的，不顧民族存亡興替，足徒肥自私「者。他們是祗知道一已的利益，對於國家民族的利害，則毫不會顧及。他們常利用職務上的便利，濫用私人，上下其手，營私舞弊，飽肥私囊。祇要自己有什麽可圖，至於如何損害國家的利益，甚至影　到存亡興替，則非他們所關心。求名利，便是他們做官的目的。這一種官吏在中國各政治階層中，實非常普遍，中國政事的不上軌道，他們實應負起很大的責任。中國肅淸貧汚工作的重要，也即在此。　　第三種就是「漠不關心危局與困難，敷衍塞責，順水推舟，食君祿，享國佬的寄生虫」。他們的作風，在中國即所謂一做一天和尚撞一天鐘」。他們祇具苟安心理，對於公事，常是馬馬虎虎敷衍塞責了事，較好者也不過抱定一不求有功，但求無過」的宗旨，雖說並未作惡，可是顯然不會有什麽成績可以做出來。這一種官吏目以爲可吿無罪於國家，但實際上拿了國俸，不替國家做些有成績的事情，尤其是在目前的戰時，不盡責即等於有罪。　　現在我們所需要的領導，應是對國家對民族富有熱忱，而具犧牲精神的人物，恃勢凌人及營私自肥的惡劣份子固須去除；荀且偸安，應領導別人而反被人領導的庸懦分子，也無容立足的餘地。希望爲政者痛加反省。建部辦理航商　請領通行證　　南京三日中央社電　建設部爲辦理航商請領通行證書事宜，特訂定辦法，於十二月一日以部令公布施行。軍民一體協力　逹到禁政目的　梅部長對禁煙問題談話　　南京三日中央社電二日最高國防會識臨詩會議，業通過三十四年度禁烟事宜改軍委會主管，中央社記者爲明瞭過去辦理禁烟情形與梅內長對此舉措之惑想，特於昨日午後前趨叩詢，當承梅內長於延見，茲略誌答問如此　　（問）內政部自辦理禁政業已八閱月，請問過去辦理槪况如何？（答）關於本部過去辦理禁烟情形可分三點言之：（一）分期戒絕，根據政府禁烟計劃，依照規定辦理，三月廿九日始减少烟民總數五之一，但本部過去八月辦理以來，業已減少烟民總數一成中之七八，實已超過中央之規定，揆其最大原因，乃因官土配給逐日漸少，烟民亦隨之大减，故預料在未來四月中，當能達成預期目的。　　（二）烟民登記，除鄂贛豐三省因交通不便，開始辦理登記較遲，未有報吿烟民登記情形外，蘇浙皖三省及京滬兩市，業於八月三十日截止，登記烟民總數雖未確定，但在此三省兩市政令所及之區域，十萬烟民中，則已有八九萬烟民申請登記，其所未登記之一二成烟民，則多爲不明政府禁令而迴避者，但未登記之烟民一經查獲，即當依法治罪。　　（三）戒烟情形，關於戒烟情形，由本部委托衛生署舉辦，經費則由本部撥付，衛生署自接辦後，異常努力，除於九月間，在京滬各成立一戒烟醫院外，並令各省市公私立醫院開始兼辦戒烟工作，故頗著成績。（問）禁烟事宜歸軍委會主管後，在禁政上又獲得如何之更大效果？（答）辦理禁烟，非獨立所能完成者，必須軍警一體協力，始可達禁政目的，此次禁政旣由軍委會主管，則軍響必更能進一步協力推進，則其成績，亦必當較內政部過去爲顯著。（問）過去失敗之症結何在，今後欲期成功，當注意何點（答）過去禁政失敗原因置多，但其根本原因，多與政治有關，事變前，各省均普通　行禁政，但成績最著者，需推蘇浙兩省，蓋該兩省實爲真正致力於禁政者故本人以爲今後辦理禁政事宜，最主要者，應以不貪汚之觀念，來辦理政，則禁烟政策，自能順利推進也。林書記長訓令　青少年協力禁毒　　南三日中央社電二日最高國防會議，決定强力推行禁烟計劃，將禁烟什么構改隸軍委會，實定禁烟運動躍進階段之發展，同時一二七運動將屆週年紀念，中國靑少年團總監中國靑年模範團書記長林柏生，於此特訓令靑少年團團員靑年模範團團員，秉承政府意旨，領」導民衆，在陳代主席領導之下，不消沉，不浮豈，以最有紀律，最有組織，最有計劃之行動，厚集社會力量，爲政府後盾，使禁烟成功。略謂去年十　　一年以來禁政實況　　去年十二十七，清毒運動周年紀念轉瞬即到，一年來政府推行禁政之實况，當爲全國青年同志所注目，明年度實施之方案尤爲全國靑年同志所關心，猶憶去年首都淸毒運動爆發正，我領袖決定施手術取出背部子彈之前夕，領袖平惜愛護靑年如慈父嚴師之對子女，門徒接得報吿，首都靑年已發動清毒運動，對靑年之安全關懷備至深宵不寐靜候報吿，兩星期後病體稍痊，淸理政事，將於消淸毒禁烟首以配合政治力與社會力，積極策進爲急務，偶有危辭聳聽，以汚蠛我靑少年淸毒運動者，領袖輒含淚斥之曰，「吾輩革命黨不引導靑年努力奮鬥，豈將日與貪官汚吏奸商惡覇爲伍坐視國亡種滅乎！」其言之沉痛也，如此。十月間本人代表靑少年諸同志奉省領袖於名古屋醫院病楊之側，親承訓誨領袖痛苦呻吟中所垂詢者，爲「民間的苦」所期待者爲「靑年同志」所關懷者爲「情毒救國」，寥寥數語，叮　彌切，至今猶深印於腦海，今淸毒運動將屆周年領袖已棄吾人所慟

        <h1>1944.12.04</h1>
<h3>Order for American Nationals in Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the American Embassy in Chongqing, feeling threatened by the active advances of Japanese forces in southeastern China, has issued a special order for the rapid evacuation of 50 American nationals residing in northern Yunnan Province, western Guangxi Province, and eastern Guizhou Province.</p>
<h3>Loss of Air Bases in China by U.S. Forces Significantly Impacts the War Situation; Kunming and Chengdu Are Now Threatened</h3>
<p>A Certain Base on the China Front, 3rd (Central News Agency): All positions of the U.S. Air Force in southwestern China have collapsed due to the Japanese army's advances. The U.S. Air Force has been forced to retreat to Kunming and Chengdu, and these locations are now also under significant threat. The future actions of the U.S. Air Force are a matter of great concern.</p>
<p>The U.S. 14th Air Force, primarily linking Kunming and the Guilin area, established a chain of extended bases along the coast in an attempt to attack the Japanese mainland. Since the deployment of B-29s in Chongqing in April of this year, this plan has become more aggressive. Despite General Chennault's boastful remarks, his plan has ultimately failed, and the focus of his mission has now shifted to the following three points: (1) acting as the vanguard for the 20th Air Force; (2) disrupting maritime supply lines; and (3) creating disturbances in peaceful areas of China.</p>
<p>An even more important mission is to support the U.S. military's supreme strategy for a counteroffensive against Japan in the Pacific. The Japanese army's current offensive on the mainland has thwarted this enemy plan, launching massive attacks in North, Central, and South China, and establishing a strategic advantage of absolute superiority.</p>
<p>As a result of this operation, the U.S. military, with its forward bases in full retreat, has had all of its missions blocked, suffering military pressure. The U.S. 14th Air Force has therefore completely lost its value. This can be pointed out in the following two ways: (1) the loss of the forward function has isolated the 20th Bomber Command; and (2) the retreat of forward bases has thwarted coastal operations. The enemy has long been aware of the dangers of B-29s bombing the Japanese mainland from bases in China. Pressure from the Japanese army on inland bases in Chongqing will inevitably intensify. In particular, the recent Japanese strategy aims to destroy the enemy's war effort, both materially and psychologically. As the enemy actively attempts to bomb the Japanese mainland, the Japanese military's suppression of enemy bases is the most satisfying blow. The thwarting of coastal plans has forced the U.S. Air Force to change its strategy, which has had a significant impact on the overall war situation.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Shimomura Arrives in Beijing to Assume New Post</h3>
<p>Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency): Lieutenant General Shimomura, the newly appointed supreme commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, arrived in Beijing by air at 2:40 PM on the second.</p>
<h3>Measures Regarding Commercial and Wartime Policies at Embassy</h3>
<p>Beijing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese embassy in Beijing held a meeting of embassy chiefs under its jurisdiction at 11:00 AM on the second. This was the first joint meeting since Ambassador Kusunoki took office. Various measures to promote the decisive battle posture in North China were discussed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Nationalist Party's Message to the People: Uphold Chairman's Legacy</h3>
<p>On January 9th of the thirty-second year [1943], the National Government entered the war, clearly showing the country that only by sharing the responsibility of East Asia can we save ourselves from destruction. In the past, we must not be arrogant, and from now on, we must not abandon ourselves. Through years of effort, coupled with the determination to live and die with our allies, we can reclaim concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Our Premier's dying instructions have now been concretely realized.</p>
<p>Looking back over the past twenty years, our Chairman has worried and toiled, running around and appealing for help, never finding peace, all for the sake of the suffering masses, the fragmented land, and the turbulent East Asia! We still remember last October, when China and Japan abolished the basic relationship treaty and revised the alliance treaty. Those who previously had doubts about the country's freedom and unity should now be relieved. The issue of troop withdrawal has also been directly resolved, even abolishing the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol.</p>
<p>Having obtained these conditions for just peace after defeat, what more can we ask for if we continue to work towards restoration? It was unexpected that the Chongqing side was repeatedly deceived at the Cairo Conference, and has been following this path ever since. Imperialists have turned against us, initially making things difficult, then oppressing us, and are about to implement their fourth phase of direct control, abandoning us and then controlling us. This is because England and America do not love China; they love to use it as a sacrifice. Once the degree of exploitation is exhausted, why regret abandoning it? Once the cunning plan of sacrifice has been sold, why hesitate to control us?</p>
<p>Recently, the attitude of England and America towards Chongqing has deteriorated daily. It is not that their love and hatred have changed, but that the ugly faces of aggressors are inherently like this. Alas! We are the fish on the chopping board, the pain of a nation's demise and the worry of extinction have been evident in various facts for years. Will we turn a blind eye and sink into the unrecoverable hell? Or will we rise together and free ourselves? I hope my compatriots will think deeply about this.</p>
<p>Since the peace movement began, there have been many hardships and setbacks, but the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration offer hope for the realization of Pan-Asianism. After the Premier's death, our Chairman led the anti-aggression struggle. All my comrades and compatriots should continue to uphold his legacy and carry it through to the end.</p>
<h3>The More Intense Our Struggles, the Closer We Are to Victory</h3>
<p>All that has been said above is a historical account of the internal and external struggles of the past twenty years. At the First National Congress, Third Plenary Session, our party accepted the Premier's will and solemnly declared, "Our entire party will unanimously carry out the Premier's instructions and will not create anything new." The New Life Movement Outline personally drafted by our Chairman also clearly stated, "We will not promote a different ideology." We have "the Three Principles of the People as the foundation for building the Republic of China." All my comrades and compatriots must see the path of the peace movement as increasingly bright and correct. Our Chairman has dedicated his life to upholding the Premier's instructions, and what he has left to our country and nation can be said to be without regret!</p>
<p>What we cannot forget is that peaceful unification has not yet been realized, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War still requires effort. This is the responsibility of those who come after! This is also the process by which our Chairman inherited the Premier's leadership of the revolution. With the Chairman's lifelong dedication to the national revolution and his loyalty to Premier Sun Yat-sen, all his instructions are based on the Premier's legacy. He ensured that all misunderstandings and distortions were not used as pretexts, and that the fundamental spirit was advanced and utilized more effectively with the progress of the times. We must follow this purpose, adhere to the Premier's instructions, uphold the Chairman's legacy, be single-minded and avoid detours, and bravely advance to final success.</p>
<p>At this time of crisis and bitter struggle, we have also encountered the Chairman's passing. Comrades of our party should examine themselves, and the people of the whole country should reflect and take responsibility. We must know that the destiny of the nation lies in the self-determination of the people. Without the ability to be self-reliant internally, there is no qualification to coexist externally. In terms of self-reliance, we must enrich the people's strength and develop the country's strength to the best of our ability. In terms of coexistence, we must fulfill all the obligations that should be fulfilled in order to enjoy the rights that should be enjoyed.</p>
<p>The most important thing today is sincere unity, and the most urgent tasks are to complete the war, promote unification, and eradicate the communist scourge. Only through the unity of the entire party can we concentrate outstanding combat cadres and establish the central revolutionary force. Only through national unity can we achieve true unification and eliminate the crisis of partition. Only through the unity of China and Japan, and the unity of East Asia, can we resist external violence and seek internal coexistence, and then world peace can be established.</p>
<p>Bureaucracy is a germ that erodes the revolutionary spirit and hinders democratic forces. Our party must do its utmost to eradicate it. Corrupt politics is a toxin that directly harms people's livelihoods and indirectly creates the communist scourge. Our party must do its utmost to eliminate it. During the war, hardship is unavoidable, but roaming bandits destroy production, unscrupulous merchants hoard and manipulate prices, and harsh taxes exploit the people. All of these are man-made sufferings. Our party must do its utmost to alleviate them.</p>
<p>Hatred of neighbors and flattery of foreigners is the slavish mentality of defeatists. Our party must do its utmost to eradicate it. Peaceful unification is the ladder to national salvation. Our party must do its utmost to promote it. The Greater East Asia War is the first step in revitalizing China and protecting Asia. Our party must do its utmost to complete it. The alliance treaty is the foundation of Sino-Japanese peace, and the joint declaration is the guideline for East Asian co-prosperity. Our party must do its utmost to implement them, ensuring that every word is realized. The more urgent the world changes, the more intense our struggles, and the closer we are to victory.</p>
<p>Looking back, although time passes quickly, every struggle has led to progress. Looking forward, the freedom and equality of China and the independence and liberation of East Asia are already in sight. With one heart and one mind, we must strive forward and overcome difficulties together. The spirit of the Chairman in heaven will surely watch over us. (End of full text)</p>
<h3>Editorial: The Necessary Vigilance and Reflection</h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Tokutomi Soho wrote an article in the Mainichi Shimbun entitled "Expectations for the Leadership Class," in which he pointed out many undesirable phenomena exhibited by the "leadership class." In China, these issues can be said to be extremely serious. The politics of the Allied nations, in terms of both institutions and personnel, are well-organized and naturally much healthier than China's. Even with such healthy governance in the Allied nations, Mr. Tokutomi still felt the need to write an article to encourage further progress. How much more should our country, with its many institutional and personnel shortcomings, be vigilant and reflective!</p>
<p>What Mr. Tokutomi said that is subject to criticism is the so-called "job-selling elements" in the leadership class. There is no need to hide that among the officials in China's leadership class, there are certainly many who can follow the will of the founding father, but there are obviously too many who are incompetent or even derelict in their duties. We can divide the incompetent elements among the officials in China's leadership class into three types, some of whom may possess multiple characteristics.</p>
<p>The first type is those who are "powerful and domineering." They "lack enthusiasm, seriousness, spirit, and other qualities" in their work, but when they put up a facade, they have an awe-inspiring air. The so-called "being an official means being imposing" is their spirit as officials. How can such unapproachable people lead others? Moreover, those who take advantage of their power may even commit all kinds of wrongdoing. If they are displeased, they may even hold the power of life and death over others' lives and property. We have seen this type of official in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they do not exist now. They are not only derelict in their duties, but they are also breaking the law.</p>
<p>The second type is those who "disregard the country's noble goals, disregard the nation's survival, prosperity, and decline, and only seek to enrich themselves." They only know their own interests and do not care about the interests of the country and the nation. They often use their positions to abuse private power, favor their own people, manipulate things from above and below, engage in corruption and bribery, and fill their own pockets. As long as they can gain something for themselves, they do not care how much they harm the interests of the country or even affect its survival, prosperity, and decline. The pursuit of fame and fortune is their purpose as officials. This type of official is very common in all political levels in China, and they should bear a great responsibility for China's chaotic state of affairs. The importance of China's work in eliminating corruption lies here.</p>
<p>The third type is those who "are indifferent to crises and difficulties, perfunctorily fulfill their responsibilities, go with the flow, and are parasites who eat the emperor's salary and enjoy the country's benefits." Their style of work is what is known in China as "doing just enough to get by each day." They are merely concerned with seeking peace of mind and are often perfunctory in handling official matters. The better ones may only adopt the principle of "not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." Although they may not be doing evil, it is clear that they will not achieve anything. These officials believe that they are innocent of any crime against the country, but in reality, taking the country's salary without doing anything of value for the country, especially in the current wartime situation, is equivalent to being guilty.</p>
<p>What we need now are leaders who are enthusiastic about the country and the nation and possess a spirit of sacrifice. We must remove the evil elements who rely on their power to be domineering and enrich themselves, as well as the mediocre elements who seek temporary safety and comfort and should be leading others but are instead being led. We hope that those in power will reflect deeply on this.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Construction to Handle Applications for Permits for Shipping Merchants</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Ministry of Construction has specially formulated measures for handling applications for permits for shipping merchants, which were promulgated and implemented by a ministerial order on December 1st.</p>
<h3>Military and Civilians Unite to Achieve the Goal of Eliminating Opium: Minister Mei's Talk on the Opium Prohibition Issue</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): On the 2nd, the Supreme National Defense Conference held a temporary meeting, at which it was decided that matters relating to the prohibition of opium in the 34th year [1945] would be overseen by the Military Affairs Commission. In order to understand the past situation of opium prohibition and Minister Mei's thoughts on this measure, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special trip to inquire yesterday afternoon. Minister Mei received them and answered their questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) The Ministry of Interior has been handling opium prohibition for eight months. What is the general situation of the work done in the past? (Answer) The past work of the Ministry of Interior on opium prohibition can be divided into three points: (1) phased abstinence. In accordance with the government's opium prohibition plan, the total number of opium addicts was reduced by one-fifth, but since the Ministry began handling this issue eight months ago, it has already reduced the total number of opium addicts by 70-80%. This has exceeded the central government's regulations. The biggest reason for this is that the allocation of government land has gradually decreased, and the number of opium addicts has also greatly decreased. Therefore, it is expected that the intended goal will be achieved in mid-April.</p>
<p>(2) Registration of opium addicts. Except for the three provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, and Hunan, where registration started later due to inconvenient transportation and no reports on the registration of opium addicts have been received, registration in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, ended on August 30th. Although the total number of registered opium addicts has not been determined, in the areas under the jurisdiction of these three provinces and two cities, 80-90,000 opium addicts out of 100,000 have applied for registration. The 10-20% of opium addicts who have not registered are mostly those who are unaware of the government's opium prohibition orders and are evading them. However, opium addicts who have not registered will be punished according to the law once they are found.</p>
<p>(3) Opium cessation. The Ministry has entrusted the Department of Health to organize opium cessation, and the expenses are paid by the Ministry. The Department of Health has worked very hard since taking over this task. In addition to establishing opium cessation hospitals in Nanjing and Shanghai in September, it has also ordered public and private hospitals in various provinces and cities to begin handling opium cessation work, which has achieved good results. (Question) After the opium prohibition matter is taken over by the Military Affairs Commission, what greater effect will it have on opium prohibition? (Answer) Opium prohibition cannot be completed independently. It must be carried out jointly by the military and police in order to achieve the goal of opium prohibition. Now that the opium prohibition matter is under the jurisdiction of the Military Affairs Commission, the military and police will be able to cooperate and promote it further, and the results will be more significant than in the past. (Question) What were the root causes of past failures, and what should be paid attention to in order to achieve success in the future? (Answer) There are many reasons for the failure of opium prohibition in the past, but the root cause is mostly related to politics. Before the incident, opium prohibition was commonly practiced in all provinces, but the provinces that achieved the best results were Jiangsu and Zhejiang, because these two provinces were truly committed to opium prohibition. Therefore, I believe that the most important thing in handling opium prohibition matters in the future is to handle them with the concept of not being corrupt, and then the opium prohibition policy will be promoted smoothly.</p>
<h3>Secretary-General Lin Instructs Youth to Cooperate in Drug Prohibition</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Supreme National Defense Conference decided to vigorously promote the opium prohibition plan and transfer the opium prohibition agency to the Military Affairs Commission. The Chinese Youth League Inspector and Chinese Youth Model League Secretary-General Lin Baisheng, on the anniversary of the 12/7 Movement, specially instructed members of the Youth League and the Youth Model League to follow the government's intentions and lead the people under the leadership of Acting Chairman Chen, not to be depressed or superficial, but to use the most disciplined, organized, and planned actions to gather social forces as a backing for the government to make opium prohibition a success. Briefly speaking, the actual situation of opium prohibition since last October 27th, the anniversary of the anti-drug movement, will soon arrive, and the government's implementation of the opium prohibition plan over the past year should be paid attention to by youth comrades across the country. The implementation plan for next year is of even greater concern to young people across the country.</p>
<p>I still remember last year when the anti-drug movement broke out in the capital, our leader was about to undergo surgery to remove a bullet from his back. The leader, who always cared for young people like a loving father and strict teacher to his children, was very concerned about the safety of the young people after receiving the report that the capital's youth had launched an anti-drug movement. He stayed up late into the night waiting for reports. Two weeks later, his health improved slightly, and he handled government affairs. He said that the top priority in eliminating drugs and prohibiting opium was to combine political and social forces and actively promote it. When there were dangerous words that slandered our youth's anti-drug movement, the leader rebuked them with tears in his eyes, "If we revolutionaries do not guide young people to work hard and fight, will we join corrupt officials, corrupt merchants, and evil bullies and sit idly by as the country is destroyed and the race is exterminated!" His words were so painful.</p>
<p>In October, I represented the youth comrades and served the leader beside his sickbed in Nagoya Hospital. I personally received his teachings. The leader inquired about "the suffering of the people" and what he expected of "young comrades." What he cared about was "saving the country through drug prohibition." A few words were repeated and repeated, and they are still deeply imprinted in my mind. Now that the anti-drug movement is about to reach its first anniversary, the leader has abandoned us. After this mourning, how should we carry out the leader's legacy to comfort the leader's spirit in heaven?</p>
<h3>Carrying on the Legacy and Eliminating Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>Since the leader's death, Acting Chairman Chen has inherited the leader's chairmanship of the country and completed the leader's unfinished ambitions during his lifetime. On the day he took office, Acting Chairman Chen immediately announced to the people that he would resolutely implement the leader's policies and measures and would make great determination to thoroughly carry out the leader's unfinished business. This time, the Supreme National Defense Conference decided to continue to implement the opium prohibition plan designated by the leader in the past, and in order to promote it quickly and forcefully, the opium prohibition agency was transferred to the Military Affairs Commission, with Chen, the acting chairman, concurrently serving as the opium prohibition director-general. This shows the government's determination to carry out the leader's legacy, and Acting Chairman Chen's loyalty to the leader, courage to take responsibility, and sincerity in planning for the country, as well as his dedication to his duties, can serve as a model for young people across the country.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Tokyo Shot Down Five</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 6:40 PM on the 3rd: Around 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, about ten enemy B-29s came from the Mariana Islands to the suburbs of Tokyo.

<h3>American Prisoners of War Treated Humanely in Japan and Germany</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, a senior member of the U.S. House of Representatives Army Affairs Committee issued a lengthy report on the treatment of prisoners of war in Japan and Germany. The main points are as follows: In general, American prisoners of war in Germany are treated humanely. Germany is a country that has signed the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, so it can provide satisfactory treatment in accordance with the convention. Although Japan has not signed the convention, it generally abides by its provisions. According to the Swiss representative stationed in Japan, the materials provided by Japan to American prisoners of war are even better than those of the general public.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Launches Encirclement Offensive Against Hungary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Ha Tong News Agency reports: The Soviet army's goal on the Eastern Front seems to be to encircle western Hungary, with Budapest as the final target. Pressuring Slovakia from the north and east is also for this purpose. The troops in the southeast of Hungary have been greatly reduced, as most of the Soviet troops have been transferred to the confluence of the Treva River and the Danube River. Fierce battles have taken place on the Bašoštic-Kapošvár line. It is not yet known whether the enemy's actions on the Treva River will advance towards the Austrian border or turn south towards Lake Balaton and approach Budapest.</p>
<h3>German Army Launches Large-Scale Counteroffensive on the Western Front</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency): A historically unprecedented large-scale material battle is currently unfolding on the Western Front, centered on Aachen. The German army had previously adopted a defensive posture to replenish its forces, but suddenly launched a counteroffensive on December 1st. According to a dispatch from a reporter accompanying the German Western Front Headquarters, the German army suddenly launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Aachen area. The German battle group has broken into the Linich-Lendielin-Ganor triangle area in recent days, and the rear of several anti-axis troops has been cut off, and the American army has lost its retreat. The U.S. Third Army under Patton in the Saar region has made no progress. Although the U.S. army is approaching the Saar region in Metz, they are fighting in the middle of the Maginot Line in the area between Saarlautern and Metz, southwest of Forbach, and south of Saarlautern. However, the attacks of the U.S. army in the area have completely collapsed due to contact with German mines and intense crossfire.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Launches Strong Attack on Enemy Convoy in Leyte Gulf; Enemy Supply Line in Northern Leyte Island Cut Off</h3>
<p>Philippines, 3rd (Central News Agency): The U.S. military is currently working hard on relief efforts to facilitate the land operations on Leyte Island. In response, the Japanese air force has been launching fierce attacks on enemy ships and enemy bases for days, achieving the following results: (1) On the evening of the 29th, a fierce bombing raid on the enemy transport fleet in Leyte Gulf sank one ship. (2) On the 30th, the enemy transport ships east of Leyte Gulf were surrounded and attacked fiercely. On the 30th, a strong raid was launched on Tanoman, east of Tacloban airfield on Leyte Island, hitting enemy ground facilities with huge bombs.</p>
<p>Philippines, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Japanese air force has been launching strong attacks on enemy torpedo boat groups in the waters surrounding Leyte Island for days, achieving great results.

On the same day and night, a surprise attack was launched on a torpedo boat army in Leyte Gulf, sinking and destroying two of them.</p>
<p>Manila, 3rd (Central News Agency): The enemy troops in Managa Snas and Cabuquen have had their rear cut off by the Japanese army, and their land supplies of grain, ammunition, and troops have now been completely cut off. The morale of the American soldiers has been extremely low in recent days. The enemy at Managa Snas has been forced into a narrow area behind them, and a part of the enemy's 32nd Division, which was reinforcing them, was captured by the Japanese army due to breaking into a gap in the Japanese army's encirclement, and their supplies were also cut off. In addition, the Japanese army's artillery concentrated its firepower and destroyed many of its tanks. The enemy is threatened by Japanese commando teams day and night, and the enemies under siege are extremely exhausted, and those who are fleeing into the mountains to the west are constantly leaving.</p>

<h3>Prices Still Fluctuating, Awaiting Stringent Measures; Power Outages at Factories Affect Speculation and Price Manipulation</h3>
<p>Although the trend of commodity prices in the city last week was under strict supervision by the authorities, there were still sharp fluctuations, especially in daily necessities such as rice, fuel, cooking oil, salt, and cotton and woolen textiles. Therefore, the citizens of the whole city are deeply concerned about the overall price issue in the future and unanimously hope that the authorities will take the most stringent measures to thoroughly stabilize the buying and selling situation of all industries, strictly enforce the approved standard price limits, otherwise, the people's suffering will not be alleviated. At the same time, extortion and other situations urgently need to be investigated and dealt with in order to reduce the burden on merchants and people.</p>
<h3>Overview of Finance, Industry and Commerce Last Week</h3>
<p>The market situation in finance, industry and commerce in the city was still volatile last week. Incited by rumors in the speculative market, many people were searching for goods to hoard and speculate. In the financial aspect, the interest rate for red half-election (a type of financial instrument) was still stable in the first half of the week, but suddenly rose sharply in the second half of the week. Bullish traders were absorbing stocks diligently, and large investors were active, so the market rebounded from weakness on Thursday and Friday, and popular stocks saw peaks. Among them, buying picked up again because the money supply seemed to be moving, and the official interest rate for interbank lending remained at 5%, but the unofficial interest rates for interbank lending mostly increased.</p>
<p>In terms of industry and commerce, many factories in various industries, such as textile factories, were mostly stopping production due to electricity problems. Cigarette factories were also shortening their operating hours. Other silk factories and dyeing factories were also affected by electricity difficulties, which affected people's confidence. Speculators took the opportunity to manipulate prices to rise. The prices of goods in the retail shops of various companies and businesses secretly increased. Rice, miscellaneous grains, and daily necessities still saw rising trends, especially cigarettes, which rose the most sharply. Therefore, the authorities are also closely investigating and dealing with this.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Air Raid Measures for Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Police Bureau Decides on Two Measures</p>
<p>The police defense department of the city's police bureau found that, in addition to the existing ox and horse-drawn carts in the city, various military vehicles pulled by oxen and horses had suddenly appeared, and the number was increasing daily. If these livestock were to encounter unexpected situations such as sudden explosions, they would become frightened and uncontrollable. At this time, the danger to the drivers would be obvious, and pedestrians would also be in danger of accidents. Therefore, two air raid measures have been formulated to prevent problems before they occur. The measures are: (1) When an air raid alarm is issued, vehicles pulled by livestock such as oxen and horses should quickly move to the side of the road to wait. The livestock should be detached from the vehicle, and their heads and front feet should be tightly bound with strong hemp ropes to prevent them from rushing around. (2) Vehicle owners should assign people to guard the livestock such as oxen and horses during air raid alarms to prevent them from rushing around. In addition to ordering the heads of each sub-bureau to inform vehicle owners and urge them to pay attention to the above measures, the Public Utilities Bureau is also requested to add the two measures to the license regulations so that offenders can be punished according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Company Urges Protection of Water Pipes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai French Concession Tram and Electric Light Company recently stated to the public that Article 13 of the contract signed between the company and the tap water users stipulates that "users shall be responsible for the repair of water meters damaged by freezing, and the company shall not be responsible for the cost of repairs. In cold winter days, users should properly wrap the water meter box with straw, and close the main valve at night to prevent water from accumulating in the pipes to avoid freezing and cracking." Now that the severe cold has arrived, all users should pay special attention to the above regulations and take necessary measures to prevent unexpected losses.</p>
<h3>Education Bureau Calls Private University Presidents for Symposium to Discuss Registration and Tuition Issues</h3>
<p>The City Education Bureau held a symposium for the presidents of private universities and colleges in the city at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 3:00 PM yesterday (2nd). The symposium was attended by Director Dai Yingfu of the Education Bureau, the Director of the Ministry of Education, President Zheng of Shanghai University, President Hu of Aurora University, President Gu of Tongde Medical College, and 13 other representatives. The symposium discussed university improvement issues, the registration and tuition issues of private universities, and the special allocation issues for faculty and staff. The meeting lasted for three hours.</p>
<h3>Price-Controlled Cigarettes Have Disappeared</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of rationing of cigarettes in the city, the aim has been to eliminate the black market and suppress prices. Unexpectedly, in the past four months, price-controlled cigarettes have disappeared. Regardless of the size of the cigarette, retailers unanimously refuse to sell them, while the cigarette black market has become active. This not only increases the burden on citizens, but also undermines the rationing system. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will find a way to control it.</p>
<h3>When Filling in Moving Forms, New Street Names Should Be Written</h3>
<p>Most of the street names in the city (only one or two districts) were changed by the authorities from the National Day last year. Because the general public has too deep an impression of the old street names, they often write the old street names when filling in documents and applying for moving certificates. It is now known that when citizens fill in household registration moving forms or applications for residence certificates to replace citizen certificates, they must fill in the current new street names. Otherwise, all Baojia offices will not accept them and will return the original documents. It is hoped that all sectors of the public will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>For Accomplishing the Greater East Asia War: China and Japan Should Unite Closely - Interviews with the Outgoing and Incoming Commanders-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Marshal Hata, the outgoing Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, and General Okamura, the incoming Commander-in-Chief, delivered separate farewell and inaugural speeches on the afternoon of the 3rd, as follows:</p>
<p>Marshal Hata's Farewell Address</p>
<p>I am now under orders to transfer to another post. I bid farewell to the officers and soldiers of the Expeditionary Force, with whom I have shared joys and hardships on the battlefield for many years, as well as to all the beloved Chinese and Japanese military and civilian officials. I also leave behind tens of thousands of heroic spirits in the mountains and rivers where we fought, and I am filled with immeasurable emotion and sorrow at this parting. Looking back over the past three years and nine months of my tenure, I have been able to shoulder this heavy responsibility with my limited abilities and strive to carry out my mission thanks to the divine protection under His Majesty and the pure loyalty and sincerity of all the officers and soldiers. I express my heartfelt gratitude for this. Moreover, I am deeply grateful for the assistance given by various circles in both China and Japan. As the global war situation becomes increasingly critical, there is no time more important than now for China and Japan to work together and unite. Therefore, I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in China and Japan will further strengthen their solidarity and give full play to their abilities to strive for the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War. The new Commander-in-Chief, General Okamura, is known for his outstanding reputation, maturity, and experience. I am confident that he will be able to shoulder this important task, and I sincerely hope that all parties will provide him with much assistance in the future. As I bid farewell to the mountains and rivers of the mainland and return east, I recall the hardships of the soldiers on the front lines, and I wish them ever greater military success. At the same time, I wish our allied country, China, eternal prosperity and tranquility for its 400 million people.</p>
<p>General Okamura's Inaugural Address</p>
<p>I am deeply honored and grateful to have been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the China Expeditionary Force, and to assume the important role of leading the Chinese Expeditionary Force, which has achieved such glorious military exploits.</p>
<p>The former Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Hata, possesses a noble and refined personality and is a general of profound knowledge and insight. His reputation is well-known both internally and externally, and he is admired and respected by all officers and soldiers. In particular, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, he has worked tirelessly day and night to guide the destruction of the American forces on the mainland, devoting himself to his command responsibilities. He also personally visited the front lines and captured key strategic locations such as Luoyang, Liuzhou, and Guilin. He received imperial messages of commendation, enhancing his reputation both internally and externally. I am deeply honored to inherit Marshal Hata's great achievements.</p>
<p>Now, the world situation is becoming increasingly critical, and we stand at a pivotal moment for the rise and fall of East Asia. I, with utmost reverence, accept this important responsibility and vow to exert myself to the utmost, leading the entire army to continue the Expeditionary Force's tradition of certain victory. With the unity of the entire army forged like steel, we will resolutely strive to defeat the enemy Americans. At the same time, we will further strengthen cooperation with China, aiming to create a unified front between the Chinese and Japanese military and civilians to accomplish the sacred war objectives and fulfill the Imperial will.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway Continuously Defeat Retreating Chongqing Troops - Japanese Air Force Takes Off in the Rain to Bombard</h3>
<p>Chinese Front Line Base, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Guizhou-Guangxi Railway is the only escape route for the defeated Chongqing troops in the Guangxi area. American Air Force personnel and troops of the Chongqing Fourth War Zone are continuously retreating along this railway. In order to influence the pursuit by Japanese ground forces, the Japanese Air Force has launched attacks on the train convoys, causing frequent reductions in the densely packed Chongqing troops and destroying railway bridges to cut off the Chongqing troops' retreat route. Since the start of the pursuit battle along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, the weather in that area has been extremely bad. The Japanese Air Force braved the heavy rain in the battle area and dared to take off first, using new reconnaissance aircraft to take pictures along the railway. Relying on the reconnaissance aircraft, they made precise investigations of the activities of the retreating Chongqing troops, trains, automobiles, and material storage locations. They used these investigation reports as a guide for attacks, dispatching dive bomber squadrons. When necessary, they also dispatched direct descent aircraft squadrons for low-altitude reconnaissance. On the rainy days of November 17th and 18th, dive bomber squadrons, flying at extraordinarily low altitudes near Jinchengjiang, launched fierce bombing attacks on more than 100 vehicles of seven trains fully loaded with personnel and equipment, cutting off the railway. The army aviation team received two awards from the supreme aviation commander after this great victory. The team continued to launch relentless bombing attacks on the Chongqing troops. On November 29th, they bombed the railway bridge near Dushan, achieving a great victory twice as large as previous battles. Furthermore, the Japanese direct descent units, braving the sporadic activities of the American Air Force, took off to scout the enemy's situation and carried out attacks at any time. Especially on the 29th and 30th, they repeatedly bombed and strafed the large forces of Chongqing troops concentrated on the railway between Nandan and Dushan, inflicting great damage. Due to the fierce activities of the Japanese reconnaissance, direct descent, and bomber squadrons, the Chongqing troops, who were retreating along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, have been severely hit and are on the verge of collapse.</p>
