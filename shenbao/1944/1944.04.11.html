<h3 id="c1">彈劾與銓叙 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>最近國民政府對於舞弊案犯后大椿胡政處以極刑，我們認為是政府澄淸吏治，嚴肅官常的開端。國民政府起用張一鵬氏為司法行政部長，上海市政府調用吳頌臯氏為秘書長，熊劍東氏為保安處長，我們認為是政府建立專家政治，健全人事的開端。上海市政府設置巿政諮詢委員會，我們認為是政府準備建立民意機關，與民更始的開端。總括言之，這些舉措，都是政府表示强化政治的決心，都是政治趨向修明的端倪。我們人民向所夢寐以求的政治淸明，現在政府巳經接受人民要求而開始轉捩，這在人民立塲，應該如何竭力擁護，竭力支援，使開端發展至完成，使決心愈趨於堅定，實是政府與人民共同的責任。</p>
<p>我們昨天論列國民對於國家社會應具的責任感，要求國家社會的一切上軌道，政府固然有政府的責任，而人民也應有人民的責任。袖手旁觀固然不可，隔岸觀火尤其不可。今天我們更就政府的澄淸吏治與健全人事兩點，提供若干意見，以期各個配合，全面成功。</p>
<p>監察彈劾，原是澄淸吏治之一法。考試銓叙，原是健全人事之一法。所以，監察權與考試權，均列為五權之一。中山先生特創的五權憲法，其精神在五權獨立，劃淸權限，各專其責。惟就目前實際而言，形式上監察院雖為中樞最高獨立的監察機關，而職權上牽制抑壓，不能發揮效能。使五權並立，黯然無光。質直的說，現在監察的職權，還不及一個法院的檢察官，因為檢察官提起公訴後，對於法官有陪審和上訴之權，而監察院則彈劾案一經成立送出，即無究問的機會。其次，彈劾送出以後，不但無究問機會，如有特別關係，提出彈劾者反受「不知趣」的譏嘲，甚且因而受辜。例如前年十二月間，監察委員馬孟莊，呂一峯等聯名彈劾糧食部當局，結果反受免職處分一事，可以慨乎言之。</p>
<p>然而，現在政府當局已經有澄淸吏治的決心了，那未，我們希望監察當局也須發揮職權，雖則目前所賦予監察院的職權，事前旣無質詢建言之權，事後又無裁判懲戒之權，不過是事後的彈劾之權，但至少也應盡彈劾之責，對於食汚官吏，提出證據，行使彈劾，使貪汚者知所烱戒，使人民知尙有監察效能。而為全面澄淸吏治的一助。</p>
<p>其次，考試院的考選與銓叙效能，也須充分發揮，尤其是銓叙工作，雖屬消極的防制，但倖進者無法得逞，濫竽者不致充數，如果政府採取用人唯才主義，則嚴格銓叙尤不可忽視，而為全面健全人事的一助。</p>
<h3 id="c2">伊姆法爾丘陵地將展開激烈戰鬥　日印同盟軍向巴列爾猛攻 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>印度最前綫十日中央社電　日印軍北進部隊，自攻陷伊姆法爾與屯扎恩間之亨塔姆後，即迅速向印度深處進攻，將亭卡特亨塔姆北方八公里之敵軍全部掃蕩殆盡，並急追殘敵，今將到達伊姆法爾平原。緣最前綫之日印軍各部隊，七日夜已越吉拉欠波爾，伊姆法爾平原要衡南方高地之濘坡，衝破馬塔河渡頭，即於夜間進攻吉拉欠波爾，將之占領，公里之地。嗣後並由左右及背後痛擊於吉拉欠波爾盆地集緒之敵第二十三師，第三十七旅之主力及第二十七師之殘部，因此，不堪一擊之英軍，遂逃至伊姆法爾之此克波爾。伊姆法爾南方約二十五公里，於印緬國境抗戰達月餘之敵軍，今因彈藥之消耗殆盡，巳無戰鬥力，再加日印軍受日印軍之急擊，致陷於混亂狀態，軍器車輛等遺棄滿地，預料伊姆法爾之丘陵地帶，即將展開激戰。</p>
<p>印緬前綫日軍某基地十日中央社電　日印軍對英軍第二十三師所屬一旅之衆及第二十師所屬一旅之衆所展開之殲滅掃蕩戰，刻已達於最高潮，不久當可將敵殲滅。英軍第四軍急謀救出該方面敵軍，乃在巴例爾集結第二十師之主力約萬二千人，正恃大批重砲，刻空軍死命試行反攻，企圖打通退路，日日軍為覆滅巴列爾之敵，大軍即自六日晨對典諾嵊爾巴列爾南十八公里，西方八公里高地之敵軍約兩千人及巴列爾東方十公里之陣地，實施總攻。使萊馬特爾，巴列爾東有十公里之優勢敵軍携有重砲士門，向巴列爾方面潰走。敵軍因得空軍援助，亦積極實行反攻。按巴列爾乃制扼伊姆法爾平原之要衝，今於日軍猛攻下，其陷落僅為時局問題。</p>

<h3 id="c11">印度前綫隨征雜記 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>日軍精銳部隊衝過印緬國境，以破竹之勢，着着向印度推進，記者隨軍同行，現已步步向瑪尼普爾山前進，沿途耳聞目擊瑪尼普爾侯邦種種情形，拉雜記之，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>瑪尼普爾侯邦，位居印度阿薩姆州東南部，東西廣約一百五十公里，南北廣約二百公里，是一個土著侯邦。國境四周，環澆着二千公尺乃至三千公尺高的喜瑪拉雅山脈，中央部份的盆地，即侯主首都瑪尼普爾王城所在的伊姆普爾。侯邦全部人口約四十四萬五千人，其中瑪尼普爾人佔大部份，山岳地帶住有「琴」和「匈」等少數民族。瑪尼普爾族的種族源流，難以查考，或謂係與西北的梅里台族等各種族的混血種。接見記者的多數的瑪尼普爾族印度敎徒，身材高大，皮膚美觀，容貌整齊，男女都愛潔淨，女子尤其　潑天眞。這個溫存的瑪尼普爾族，截至現在為止，已經對英國的侵略，兩度奮勇作戰。</p>
<p>兩次反侵略戰</p>
<p>第一次的反侵略戰，是為拒絕英國對瑪尼普爾的干涉而起的，已成歷史上的陳蹟。其後入於英國人統治狀態，該族憎恨日深，自一八九〇年起至九一年頃，該族在柯來恩王領導下，掀起革命的烽火，但因寡不敵衆，柯來恩王國，終於在反英的最後的悲壯抵抗中滅亡了。可是現在的侯主，却一反其道，實行親英，以二千名的瑪尼普爾土著軍大隊，供英人指揮，甘心認賊作父，為虎作倀。</p>
<p>不過土著人民，都仰慕柯來恩王的遺德，心胸之中，反英的情緒，逐漸激昂，目下日印軍入印境後，都來相迎，他們被英軍强徵暴歛，已頻枯竭之境，但仍以僅有的砂糖和羊乳等，慰勞戎馬倥惚之餘的日軍。</p>
<p>琴族民性勇悍</p>
<p>琴族是從甸琴丘陵起至阿薩州東南部山岳地帶止，住於密林中的居民，別稱「那茄」，即印度語「赤裸」之意，事實上地們與新幾奈亞馬拉族的巴利奈西亞族相類似。好爭善鬥，畏於射擊，在密林的葉陰下取物，百發百中，記者經過那茄族的居住區域時，心中稍感忐志不安。</p>
<p>此族的靑年，以腰經貝殼的飾物為榮耀。在舉行血祭的時，也以敵人首級的數目相示據說貝飾數目一少，就要影響到婚姻。琴族崇拜鬼神，男女平等分配財產以後，方才舉行結婚，凡此奇風異俗，不勝枚舉，現記其中具有興味的「犬飯」一項。</p>
<p>犬飯充作珍饈</p>
<p>那是越中部緬甸國境十公里，進入加姆巴德部落以外的某琴族部落時候的事，那時恰在掠奪敗殘兵之後，琴人向記者示意說周圍一帶警戒，不得近前，於是記者將一把鹽送給一個靑年，請求通融，好容易開放警戒綫，引導記者等一行，前往酋長的居處所謂酋長的居處，是以枯葉修葺為屋頂僅足以避雨露的挖掘小屋。酋長以烈酒招飲，並為款待東來的貴賓起見，獻上一具珍餚，滾滾而動，不知為何物，吃了一口，覺得異味窮，不禁呌聲「妙哉」，酋長見到稱讚的顏色大為得意。旁邊通譯的兵士對我解說，這就是琴族的珍味「犬飯」。犬飯也者就是取乳犬一頭，整天不餵給食物，待到某一時間，忽然給它吃多量的米，待它吃畢，立刻尾　，放在火上焙炙，食其胃中的熟米飯。記者飽嚐之餘，對於該酋長的盛意，大為感激。（譯自四月二日朝日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c13">充滿決戰情緒首都市容一瞥 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>烟賭舞三禁運動奏效</p>
<p>南京十日中央社電　首都南京自府還都以，故復興甚速。市面欣欣向榮，各種建設工作亦突飛孟晋。國府參戰後，南京即以戰時姿態，出現於東亞。數十萬市民，均成為大東亞之關士，為完成保衛東亞，復興中華之偉業，均各就本位，努力以赴。最近一般市民，對於完成大東亞戰爭，更充滿擊減英美之熱忱。尤以街頭巷尾之決戰色彩，最為濃厚。婦女均效法日本婦女，穿着蒙貝褲。燙其髮，粉其面者，日趨減少。一般靑年，身着靑少年模範團黑色制服者，充溢街頭。市民不問男女老幼，行經新街口廣塲前，均虔誠向國父銅像，鞠躬致敬。一般飯館，皆不以酒供客，使人見之。有隔世之感。又南京地區，自三月以來，巳實行燈火管制，治安亦極良好。一般居民，對燈火管制尤為澈底，沿街戶均堀有防空壕，市民以為協力農業增產運動，紛紛於宅前空地，種植雜糧及蔬菜，使整個南京農村化。今南京中日兩國人民，巳携手共同前進，結為戰友，並且互相硏究彼此言語。日駐華大使館，已於四月一日在使館內開設華語學校，由海內公使親任校長。同時當局為四月一日起，掃除吸食鴉片惡習，計已開始命烟民登記，封閉非法之烟館，檢舉私販烟土者，禁烟禁舞禁賭之三禁運動，巳獲得靑少年之極大支援，而順利推進。南京文化界及醫學界，以大東亞文化者大會，及大東亞醫學者大會，將於五月在南京舉行，正努力進行一切準備。預料參戰中國之戰意，必將因大東亞文化界及醫學界之團結，而更加昻揚。又自本週起，南京復增設一文化電影院，凡此均足以充分反映南京一般民衆之戰意。綜觀上述，可知南京情形較諸二三年前，實極逈異，而充滿保衛東亞，復興中華之熱情。</p>
<h3 id="c14">赫爾廣播警吿中立國 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>里斯本十日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據華盛頓消息：美國務卿赫爾昨晚廣播，警中立國勿再供應應軸心國家。渠稱，有許多中立國，一方使用反軸心之資源，同時又協助殺害反軸心之軍人，此種態度，反軸心巳不能再事容忍。美國對於中立國之主權極為尊重，從未曾迫使一小國參加反軸心方面此次作戰。</p>
<p>法義問題表明態度</p>
<p>赫爾氏又法提民及族解放委員會，謂該委員曾不能認為係法國之政府，因此不能加以承認。美國在一義大利所關切者，為企圖襄助組織一自由之民主政府，絕不能與法南斯主義妥協，但義境事態之發展，並未如美國之期望。莫斯科會議所定之對義政策，巳由英美蘇政府妥為推行，僅關於使義政府民主化之部分尙不實現。</p>
<p>各國關係亟須調整</p>
<p>欲求永久之和平，唯有眞切調整反軸心各國切國際間有組織行動之基礎，至於大西洋憲章及莫斯科開羅及德黑蘭各次會議之宣言，幷未提出解決各項問題之方式，大西洋憲章僅表明基本之目標而已，美國仍願為蘇波兩方任調人。</p>
<h3 id="c15">德依照預定計劃　撤離奧迪薩 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>克里米亞展開攻防戰</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德國新聞社引德官方戰報稱：蘇軍巳於克里米亞半島上之茜伐許橋頭堡及貝萊柯浦地峽擴大攻勢，並巳侵入德陣數處，敵戰刻正進行中。德軍刻仍於奧迪薩區進行激烈之防禦戰，德軍經過多星期之凖備，並於破壞一切軍事設施及移去輪舶戰車及其他戰時物資後，巳由奧迪藤城退出，以實行有計劃之解脫運動。蘇軍攻於奧希（Orhei在羅境東北部之兩旁，但未獲逞，德軍於反攻時，將陣地凹陷處塡平。布哥列那（Bukorina在羅部）之東，德羅聯軍復於日昨在迂關之戰綫上，遏阻敵軍之前進。舊波境內泰諾波爾之德守軍，刻正與侵入之敵展開激烈之巷戰。</p>
<h3 id="c16">最近戰局中英美的摩擦　鹽田大尉昨日向日本橋民廣播詞 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>敵人美國呼號了很久的對日南方進攻路的尼米資艦隊，今正竭其全力轟炸進攻，想飛越日軍的特魯克。加羅林諸島，經馬尼刺而在中國南都登陸，地們的戰略，是欲將我本土及南方地域切為兩斷。</p>
<p>另一方面，英軍在蒙特巴頓的指揮下，欲奪回緬甸·泰國·越南。駐渝美空軍並渝方空軍合計有數百架，對我航行於揚子江流域並南中國海的船舶，策動游擊戰，尤其在最近，更增加了若干轟炸機，這是很値得注意的事。此等美空軍，觀隙在越南北部蠢動，並協力緬甸英軍作戰，在占領卡西諾一役中，是受德軍的猛烈抵抗，仍欲共同進行突入作戰。並跟着戰局的推移，而欲在巴爾幹設定第二戰缐。</p>
<p>蘇聯軍則渡尼愛斯特爾河，進入貝薩拉比亞，而劃策將在巴爾區哉採用的戰略。德英二軍的空戰，俞趨頻繁，最近英美用聯合的力量，企圖破壞伯林·法國北部·荷蘭等地的生產機構。</p>
<p>如上所述，現在的世界戰局，靠着美國的物質上量為唯一力量，英美蘇並其與國，保持着極密切的戰略方式。</p>
<p>我們所得到的印象，一似英蘇各以其軍事力，經濟力互相援助，英美軍在部隊的編制上，甚至也混然一體化。但其內幕，三國均同床異夢，汲汲於獲得本國的發言權利益，而爭執甚烈</p>
<p>三月底，羅斯福答新聞記者稱：「在對日作戰上，英美軍各自設定分擔的區域。美艦隊專擔任太平洋戰域，英國則擔任印度洋。「在這答辯中，顯出了他第一流的外交辭令。</p>
<p>各戰綫中，美軍常領先着英軍，昔日散佈在。七個海洋中的英帝國領土，今完全被美軍侵入蹂躪。英領土新不列顛島，一度宣傳讓渡給美國，加拿大·新西蘭·澳洲事實上已經是美國的領土</p>
<p>美國在印度發言權增加</p>
<p>更在奪還緬甸戰役的前後，美國派遣太平洋方面的陸上部隊赴緬甸戰綫，派遣一部飛行隊赴印度，並增强駐渝的史蒂威爾美空軍部隊，因此美國在印度的發言權，大為增加。這一點痛楚地刺　了惴惴於戰軍進攻印度的英國並英軍首腦部的神經。為英國設想，縱令喪失了大部分海外殖民地，但美軍如果僅口頭侵入到號稱英殖民帝國之王冠的印度，也是不能再忍耐下去的一個大打擊。設到此次敵方的緬甸反攻作戰，史蒂威爾每事要干涉蒙特巴頓的作戰，就顯露了英美作戰的不一致，重慶的發言人也曾提起過這問題。</p>
<p>生命之鍵被握於美軍的重慶，善體美國的這意響稱：「英軍的作戰，殆毫無成就。」重慶的報紙更非難說，「英國亟應捨棄困難的陸上作戰，編制有力襤隊從海上攻擊昭南島。」</p>
<p>羅斯福說：「印度洋委諸於英國艦隊」，暗中就是說：「美國不會將勢力伸展到英國的生命綫印度，」想使戰戰兢兢的英國安心，但事實完全與此相反。</p>
<p>尼米資所豪語的以中國大陸為基地對日反攻，就是想把中國，印度置於美國的制壓下。</p>
<p>最可哀者是蒙特巴頓。豪語奪回緬甸，大事宣傳其戰略與武力，堂堂皇皇就任東南亞洲軍總司令官的蒙特巴頓，內有蠶食的美軍與反英的印度民衆，外有日軍的猛攻，其處境之苦，可想而知。當然，英國曾以其艦隊的一部份集結於印度洋，但沒有足以攻擊我昭南島的除裕與實力。</p>
<p>駐渝美軍控制重慶生命</p>
<p>再看待機呼應尼米資攻勢的史蒂威爾麾下的駐渝美空軍，及駐渝美國軍人，以比蘇聯和英國佔壓倒的勢力，握着重慶的生命。所以重慶最近敢於不協力蘇聯，更有新疆省的渝軍與外蒙軍之衝突，而被蘇聯非難。重慶宣傳說專與英美取密切的合作，但實際上以重慶為中心的美國對英國，美國對蘇聯的關係，又是極微妙的。</p>
<p>重慶首腦部賞讀巴拉奧作戰中美艦隊的大規模攻勢作戰，或高唱强化重慶對聯合軍的合作，派遣使節團赴美國，專欲迎合美國，故不惜犠牲本國將士，忍受美空軍的橫暴。然重慶的一部份自覺者，以為從中國的百年大計看來，使美軍侵人中國，決不是有利的。而且這重慶的熱烈禮讚美軍，在美國一點也不見情，蓋美國一點也不以為是與重慶立在平等的立塲上作戰，他們的目的祇是如何可以在中國達到自己的野心。</p>
<p>去年史蒂威爾將貧弱的重慶空軍編入自己的部下，獲得了極大的發言權，如設立步兵學校，或訓練重慶軍隊等等，美國的勢力，日見强化起來，美國的眼中，巳經沒有了英國，並且也沒有蘇聯。</p>
<p>美國國獨佔近東利益</p>
<p>其次，在近東方面，作朗，伊拉克，阿剌伯等地方，雖完全是英國領土，但美國不顯英國的反對，而樹立獨占阿刺伯石油的計劃，欲安設輸油管。</p>
<p>大家都知道，英國在本國沒有油田，故阿剌伯的石油，到今日幾可說是生命綫。美國欲切斷這英國的命脈。此事立即傳至倫敦，艾登在議會中稱：「同盟國的美國，關於此事，或許會在事前通知英國吧！」繞着圈兒希望美國與英國相商。但美國的諾克斯立即說：「採掘阿剌伯石油，完全出於美海軍作戰上的必要。」從頭推翻了艾登的希望，不單是阿刺伯的石油問題，還有許多問題，懸而未決，而在感悄上影響到兩國能關係，所以艾登在議會上說起石油問題，諾克斯這樣答覆。更於數日前，讓渡小型航空母艦三十八艘與英國時，諾克斯也曾反駁。</p>
<p>瀕死的英區，因受美國許多的援助，致美國旁若無人，漸次略奪英國權益，因而英國弄得手足無措。加以蘇聯亦欲插足，使軍隊在近東方面進出，而欲展開巴爾幹作戰。</p>
<p>重慶的路透特派員向英本國發出警吿，稱：「蘇聯最竭力研究的目標，實是進出中亞。」</p>
<p>地中海方面，英美的爭執，以對德戰的戰略，及設定第二戰綫為中心，英美蘇互相欲獲得有利的發言權。</p>
<p>英美軍為推進歐洲反攻作戰，曾於一月設立協約國遠征軍最高司令部，但司令官艾森霍華，參謀長史密斯等，均為美國人，即英國最所注力的地中海方面作戰，也由美軍指揮官左右一切。</p>
<p>蘇聯知道在英對德反攻中，損害多而困難，故提倡泛斯拉夫主義，以其主力向巴爾幹，進入羅馬尼亞。又蘇聯雖頻頻要求英美從速設完第二戰綫，但英美都希望德蘇二國兩敗俱傷，不輕應允。即英美二國中間，英國也不喜美國進出巴爾幹，故以巴爾幹諸國為中心，三國的關係，也極為微妙。</p>
<p>那麽英本國如何呢？英本國駐有美國軍隊數十萬。所謂志高氣揚的英國人民，對於美軍的侵入自己已家中，又將作何看法呢？</p>
<p>美國國務卿赫爾，要求近在英國足下的愛爾蘭共和國退去日德官憲，英國對赫爾這話，並沒有什麼表示。</p>
<p>如上所述太平洋，印度洋，地中海，大西洋等各方面的戰局，完全由美國握其優先權，在這中間，英國竭力防止美國的侵略，汲汲於挽回本國的勢力，保全主要的領土。</p>
<p>英國的前途黯淡</p>
<p>英國現在不能不自覺到，平日最所信賴且最靠他帮助的美國，不意是最危險的存在。因此，英國現在除了以戰勝國的地位而想有所保留外，不能再有什麼希望了。</p>
<p>德國宣傳部長郭培爾在大德意志報上有一篇文章說：</p>
<p>「因着悲劇的錯誤而突入此次大戰的英國，繼續戰爭還有些什麼希望呢？，假令打倒德國能够成功的話，英國接踵將被捲入共產主義的洪流，並從現實的角度來觀察英國，在最近的將來，或許不能不實行登陸作戰，但在那時候，英國被打得不能直起腰來，這已是旣定的事實了。」</p>
<p>觀察以上述戰局為中心的英美之摩擦時，英國的悲劇，實與時俱進。譬如說，英國獲得了美國所貸與協約國的武器之百分之八十一，則在另一面，被美國所取去的損失，也同這比例一樣是極可觀的。</p>

<p>關於經濟警察，我們巳經一再加以論列，誠以戰時統制經濟的第一缺陷，便是沒有秩序與紀律，循至暴利思想與投機行為，猖獗不可收拾，而整個人民生活，遂乃趨於日暮途窮之境，這是何等嚴重的問題？在今日政府當局嚴厲取締投機抑制動價的一個統一步驟下，新經濟警察處之即將成立，實巳具有先聲奪人之力，因為上海經濟病態之複雜，有如亂麻，非有快刀，不能斬斷，而新經濟警察機構，即為淸除上海經濟界貪汚的一把快刀。</p>
<p>我們對於經濟警察所應具的種種主要條件，早經　過了，不必再說。我們於一再申論經濟警察這個問題之餘，但願喚起當局對於日本經濟警察制度，特別加以研究與參考；其在組織方面所可實我們借黨者，也不過是不同是屬於機械性的，雖以篇幅所限，未能列舉，可是，我們對於日本經濟警察運用之方針，則尤不可不特別加以認識。日本自昭和十六年（民國三十年）一月以還，其經濟警察之運用方針，固均側重於統劍之厲行無阻，但自大東亞戰爭以來，為應付現階段極其嚴重的戰局起見，則尤特別注重於：　協助生產力之增進及運輸力之增强，　保障國民之戰時生活，　根絕影響於戰力或危害國民生活等惡性之事犯等項。對於第三項，則在指導及取締經濟事犯方面，最近更有充實與澈底之辦法。由此可知經濟警察之立塲與其所負戰時的使命了。</p>

<p>本市第一警察局警察消費合作社，自籌備以來，各界贊助撥墊資本者頗為踴躍，昨據該社負責人語記者：「對各界之熱誠贊助，殊為感激，現對資金之籌措，以及社務正積極籌備進展中，且對社址亦已有着落，不日當可正式成立，開始採辦配給事宜，直接對警察生活可以安定，間接對警力亦可强化，而地方治安，亦得賴以確保。」</p>
<h3 id="c31">協力調整後　淮海省新面目　松平情報部長談話 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>日本大便館上海事務所松平情報部長，於昨（十）日下午三時在華懋飯店八樓定例會見本巿中國新聞記者，對盟邦當局協力調整淮海省各方情形，發表談話如：</p>
<p>「査淮海省前稱蘇淮特別區，國府還都以來，向屬華北政務委員會治下，自前年由中央接直管轄後，於日本協力之下，對當地機關及其命令系統，逐漸加以改變。迨至去歲，對各民衆組織亦漸次予以調整，例如去年中央電訊社在徐州設分社，將原有中華通訊社分局取消，同盟社徐州分局亦改由華中總局管轄，同時徐州之日文「東亞新報」於今年二月一日後，改為大陸新報徐州分社，繼續發刋，其他華文徐州日報社，以前所有由華北所供給之紙張等印刷材料，於本年四月一日起，由華中供給，此外中日合辦公司之活動範圍，</p>
<p>合辦公司</p>
<p>亦加變更，中日合辦公司之董事及股東，亦於雙方充分協力之下，統一調整，如徐州至蚌埠之鐵路，於四月一日後由華中鐵道公司統籌管轄，常地電話電報亦改屬華中電氣通訊公司經營，前華北廣播協會在徐州之廣由中國廣播協會管理，除與日方直接有關之機關外，其他槪　　加以調整。</p>
<p>統一通貨</p>
<p>該省通貨問題，業由周財長對此發表談話中說明，由四月十日起，槪以中儘券為標準通貨，實施全面兌換，以資統一。關於此項通貨之計關，日本基於協力中國之精神，亦通知當地各商店機關一體更改以中儲券為單位通貨，遵從國府之施策而加以調整。</p>
<p>總之，前年乃就該省之政治加以調整，現則將就經濟文化上加以調整，俾作今後上海經濟上之連繫，同時將為國府復興經濟開發資源的重鎭，我人深望經此澈底調整後，雙方能更進一步合作，以完遂戰爭勝利。」</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3 id="c32">一舉兩得 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>戰時應當實踐戰時生活，是人人應遵守的義務，所謂節約消費者，是指正當的消費，必須節約至最低限度。如果是超過消費的「糜費」和「浪費」，則根本不是正當範圍，決非用勸導節約方式，可以奏效，簡直須用禁止和取締的方式，使之不復存在。</p>
<p>中國式的賭博是禁絕了，跳舞塲營業時間是限制了，這是說明當局對於超過正當消費的「糜費」和「浪費」行為，決意禁止取締了。可是，上海有四十餘家的跳舞學校，掛了學習交際舞的招牌，而行其變相的跳舞塲之實。因為掛了學校招牌，時間通融，進出自由，是誘使男女靑年趨於墮落茍且的媒介，的陷穽，金錢浪費巳違背戰時生活，意志消沉尤其是損耗國力的致命傷。</p>
<p>其次，上海有一百餘家的歌女社嚮導社，掛了歌唱與導游的招脾，以女子職業為餌，招致近萬靑年女子壓迫威脅，使之沉淪墮落，社主坐收漁利，於是充塞旅店，賭博狂歡，三位一體，形成繁華都巿，奢糜風習，這與戰時生活尤其背道而馳。</p>
<p>在此決戰時代，革新時期，希望警察當局進一步重視之，從速矯正此種不合理現象。至於歌女的出路問題，當此增產年頭，動力機力節制環境中，手工業的提倡，自有必要，希望企業家們移轉一部分做地產做股票的實力，興辦手工業，招用並訓練這般女子從事生產工作。旣可帮助解決社會病態，復能提倡生產事業，也是一舉兩得之道。相信大企業家們不會漠視吧！</p>

<p>— 潘光振</p>
<p>目前將成立巿政諮詢委員會，可說是一個民意機關的前奏，又可說是巿民參政的準備，果如斯說，則諮詢委員會委員，負上海市政修明責任，領數百萬市民囑托，其負荷之艱巨，使命之重大，實不能言喩矣。</p>
<p>在未發表委員人名以前，吾人先檢討一下委員人選，以過去上海市議會以及參議會人選先例，這次諮詢委員會委員，又是大同小異。可是巿議會參議會等在當時因何無若多成績呢？簡言之，委員人選，太側重聲譽制，結果，委員與市民間，仍舊隔質，下意仍不能上達，上旨難如期下宜，民意機關的設置，徒有其名，未獲其實。</p>
<p>現諮詢委員會委員人選，應放棄延聘聲譽制，而重學識經騐，在可能範圍內，應伸出都巿地域，擴張至鄕僻在野，羅致在鄕賢能出任，則臨民較切，施政亦易。</p>
<p>此次諮詢委員會委員名額，似應備量擴充，委員人選採用推選制，以一聯保或一鎭一鄕一區產生一位委員為最妥，這是環境需要而且是市民們的期望。</p>

<p>新普育堂，一切設備，相當完美，中下家庭不及他，上等家庭不多見，加以他們用科學方式的管理，一切的一切，眞是分析得萬分的淸楚，處處表示着，有精神，有步驟，而同時他們對於開支一項，處處從節省方面着想，如：蔬菜自己種，猪自己養，藥品方面，除少數各界捐助外，其餘他們都自己買原料，自己製造（係修女中曾學藥劑師者任之）同時，他們不但重於節約，而且一方面在開源，如：工讀生，能刺綉，挑花，織襪，織網，編布袋……等，年老婦人方面，如能縫紉，修補破衣服，釘鈕扣……等，雖然生產收入是很少的，但是，不無小補，所收容的苦難者，每人衣，食，住。生活一律免費供給。務使幼者有長，老者有終。衣食，敎育，醫藥，同時並進。</p>
<p>該堂雖係已故慈善家陸伯鴻氏所創辦，畢生盡瘁於此。（現由陸氏哲嗣繼任）然由天主敎仁愛會的修女姆姆相助辦理一切內部工作，她們犧牲自己一生的幸福，來為孤苦兒童謀幸福，當作自己的安慰，那種偉大犧牲的精神，實令人發生萬分的欽佩和敬意。</p>

<p>天空海闊（七）</p>
<p>該艦隊的母港是橫須賀，在回到橫須賀前，曾路過二見，於是便參謁伊勢大神宮，這對於他們來說，是有極大的意義的。與其對論一百次國家威武，倒莫如參拜一次神宮更為有意義——至少眞人是這樣想法。且在二見椗泊的期間，曾舉行過一年一度的慣例大校閱。</p>
<p>從二見到橫須賀，這是因地航行的最後路綫。對於眞人來說，是降生以來第一次作東海旅行。而聯想到　摩武士的祖先是來自　倉的時候，於是對於一望無際的碧海，也不能不發生一種戀戀不捨的感情。</p>
<p>軍艦正在淸水冲航行的時候，眞人吃完晚飯，獨自一個人跑到後面的甲板去了。白的，綠的和紅的航海燈，巳經放出絲絲的光綫來。他突然發見了西方陸地上一個令人驚奇的東西。</p>
<p>「呵，是富士山！」</p>
<p>是雲霧非常濃厚的一天，但幸而被風吹晴，使他能看見富士山。這個富士山的姿態，除了在像片和畫片中欣賞過外，是從未親眼看見過的，但山的風景，是老早就知道的。究竟是否有雲霧，自已却無法認淸，但看着是一副美麗的影圖。只覺得心中，似乎有一種情感使自己頂禮摩拜他。眞人看到了富士山，立刻感覺到業已來到了日本的中心所在。於是便想到明日將完的內地航行練習。</p>
<p>兩個月期間的航海，使他發見了日本的幅員廣大。同時，也使他明白了什麽是艦內生活。也使他知道了士官的工作，責任與態度。至於指導官的恩威，也深深地印在腦際裏了。</p>
<p>（然而，其中最大的經騐，是什麼呢？）眞人搖了一下頭。</p>
<p>（呵，知道了，自已有部下了。）</p>
<p>他這是第一次和下士官以及水兵接近。第一次感覺到對部下的情感。至於上司的責任，也第一次體會到了。這就是眞人的結論。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Impeachment and Appointments <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the National Government imposed the death penalty on Hu Zheng, a major offender in a bribery case. We believe this is the beginning of the government's efforts to cleanse the bureaucracy and enforce official discipline. The National Government has appointed Zhang Yipeng as the Minister of Judicial Administration, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has appointed Wu Songgao as Secretary-General and Xiong Jiantong as the Director of the Public Security Bureau. We believe this is the beginning of the government's efforts to establish expert governance and improve personnel management. The Shanghai Municipal Government has established a Municipal Advisory Committee, which we believe is the beginning of the government's preparation to establish a public opinion organ and start anew with the people. In summary, these measures all demonstrate the government's determination to strengthen politics and are signs of political improvement. The political integrity that we, the people, have long dreamed of is now being addressed by the government in response to the people's demands. From the people's perspective, we should do our utmost to support and assist, so that the beginning develops to completion and the determination becomes more firm. This is a shared responsibility of the government and the people.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we discussed the sense of responsibility that the people should have towards the nation and society, and we demanded that everything in the nation and society be on the right track. The government certainly has its responsibilities, but the people should also have their responsibilities. Standing idly by is certainly not acceptable, and watching from the sidelines is even more unacceptable. Today, we offer some suggestions on the government's efforts to cleanse the bureaucracy and improve personnel management, in order to achieve comprehensive success through mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>Supervision and impeachment are originally a method of cleansing the bureaucracy. Examination and appointment are originally a method of improving personnel management. Therefore, the power of supervision and the power of examination are both listed as one of the five powers. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's unique Five-Power Constitution is based on the spirit of the independence of the five powers, clearly defining the limits of authority, and each being responsible for its own duties. However, in terms of the current reality, although the Control Yuan is nominally the highest independent supervisory organ of the central government, it is constrained and suppressed in terms of its functions and cannot exert its effectiveness. This makes the five powers stand side by side, but dimmed and lackluster. To put it bluntly, the current supervisory power is not even as good as a prosecutor in a court, because after a prosecutor files a public prosecution, they have the right to jury trial and appeal to the judge, while the Control Yuan has no opportunity to investigate after an impeachment case is filed. Secondly, after the impeachment is sent out, not only is there no opportunity to investigate, but if there are special relationships involved, those who filed the impeachment are ridiculed for "not knowing what's good for them," and may even suffer as a result. For example, the incident in December of the previous year, when Control Yuan members Ma Mengzhuang, Lü Yifeng, and others jointly impeached the authorities of the Ministry of Food, and as a result, they were dismissed from their positions, can be lamented.</p>
<p>However, now that the government authorities have the determination to cleanse the bureaucracy, we hope that the supervisory authorities must also exercise their functions. Although the current powers given to the Control Yuan do not include the power of questioning and suggesting beforehand, nor the power of judging and punishing afterwards, but only the power of impeachment afterwards, at least they should fulfill the responsibility of impeachment. They should present evidence against corrupt officials and exercise impeachment, so that the corrupt know to be cautious, and the people know that there is still supervisory effectiveness, and contribute to a comprehensive cleansing of the bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Secondly, the examination and appointment effectiveness of the Examination Yuan must also be fully exerted, especially the work of appointment. Although it is a passive prevention, those who seek advancement through luck cannot succeed, and those who are incompetent will not fill the ranks. If the government adopts the principle of using people based on their talents, then strict appointment is especially indispensable, and it will contribute to a comprehensive improvement of personnel management.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battles to Unfold in the Imphal Hills; Japanese-Indian Allied Forces Fiercely Attack Palel <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>From the Front Lines in India, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese-Indian forces moving north, after capturing Hengtam between Imphal and Tonzang, quickly advanced deep into India. They completely eliminated the enemy forces eight kilometers north of Tingtat Hengtam and are rapidly pursuing the remnants, now reaching the Imphal Plain. On the night of the 7th, the various units of the Japanese-Indian forces on the front lines had crossed Jirighat-Churachandpur, the swampy slopes of the southern highlands, a crucial point in the Imphal Plain, and broke through the Mata River crossing. They attacked and occupied Churachandpur at night, […km] away. Afterwards, they struck hard from the left, right, and rear against the main force of the 23rd Division and the 37th Brigade, as well as the remnants of the 27th Division, which were gathered in the Churachandpur basin. As a result, the vulnerable British forces fled to Bishenpur, about 25 kilometers south of Imphal. The enemy forces, which had been fighting on the Indo-Myanmar border for over a month, are now out of ammunition and have no fighting ability. Furthermore, they have been thrown into disarray by the rapid attacks of the Japanese-Indian forces, abandoning weapons and vehicles all over the ground. It is expected that fierce battles will soon unfold in the hilly areas of Imphal.</p>
<p>From a Certain Japanese Military Base on the Indo-Myanmar Front, 10th (Central News Agency) — The annihilation campaign launched by the Japanese-Indian forces against a brigade of the British 23rd Division and a brigade of the British 20th Division has now reached its climax and will soon be able to annihilate the enemy. The British Fourth Corps is urgently trying to rescue the enemy forces in that area and has gathered the main force of the 20th Division, about 12,000 men, in Palel. Relying on a large number of heavy artillery, the air force is desperately trying to launch a counterattack, attempting to open a retreat route. In order to destroy the enemy in Palel, the Japanese forces launched a general offensive on the morning of the 6th against the enemy forces of about 2,000 men on the highlands 18 kilometers south and 8 kilometers west of Tiddim and 10 kilometers east of Palel. They forced the superior enemy forces at Laimatak and 10 kilometers east of Palel, carrying heavy artillery, to collapse towards Palel. The enemy forces are also actively counterattacking with the support of the air force. Palel is a key point controlling the Imphal Plain. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese forces, its fall is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Maritime Defense Force Active in the North and South Pacific; Sinks Multiple Enemy Submarines in a Wide Area <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Maritime Defense Force is active day and night in the vast areas of the North and South Pacific, and its remarkable achievements have been repeatedly seen in war history. The following is a record of the sinking of enemy submarines by the team at a certain base. One, on the morning of April 3, a Japanese convoy departing from the base was sailing in a certain direction when a patrol plane responsible for defense suddenly discovered the periscope of an enemy submarine about 10 kilometers behind the convoy. It immediately bombed the submarine, hitting the rear of the submarine's conning tower. The bow of the submarine immediately rose to the surface at a right angle and soon sank. Two, on the night of April 4, a Japanese patrol ship on guard duty in a certain area suddenly detected the sound of an enemy submarine submerged nearby using a hydrophone. It immediately rushed to its vicinity and attacked. As a result, the ship was hit and, in a panic, it leaked a large amount of heavy oil and sank within one kilometer. Three, on the morning of April 5, a Japanese defense ship responsible for defending the fleet in a certain area suddenly detected several submarines lurking in front of the convoy using a hydrophone. It immediately rushed to the vicinity of the submarines and bombed them with depth charges. As a result, a large number of bubbles floated to the surface. After repeated bombing with dozens of depth charges, the heavy oil gushing from the enemy submarines covered the surface of the sea. Four, on the afternoon of March 31, a Japanese escort plane responsible for defending the convoy in a certain area suddenly discovered an enemy submarine lurking nearby and immediately bombed it. At the same time, the convoy's defense ship also rushed to the location and jointly bombed it with depth charges. Soon, the enemy submarine simultaneously gushed a large amount of heavy oil from three locations and sank.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Random Notes from the Indian Front <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The elite units of the Japanese army have crossed the Indo-Myanmar border and are advancing into India with unstoppable momentum. This reporter is traveling with the army and is now advancing step by step towards the foothills of Manipur. Along the way, I have heard and witnessed various situations in the Manipur princely state. I am recording them here for the readers.</p>
<p>The Manipur princely state is located in the southeastern part of Assam, India, extending approximately 150 kilometers from east to west and 200 kilometers from north to south. It is an indigenous princely state. The state is surrounded by the Himalayan mountain range, which is 2,000 to 3,000 meters high. The basin in the central part is Imphal, where the capital of the princely state, Manipur, is located. The total population of the princely state is approximately 445,000, of which the Manipur people make up the majority. The mountainous areas are inhabited by minority ethnic groups such as the Chin and Kuki. The origin of the Manipur people is difficult to trace. Some say they are a mixed race of the Meitei and other ethnic groups in the northwest. Most of the Manipur Hindus who met with the reporter were tall, had beautiful skin, and neat features. Both men and women loved cleanliness, and the women were especially innocent and lively. This gentle Manipur people have fought bravely against British aggression twice so far.</p>
<p>Two Anti-Aggression Wars</p>
<p>The first anti-aggression war was fought to reject British interference in Manipur and has become a historical relic. After entering a state of British rule, the hatred of the tribe deepened. From around 1890 to 1891, the tribe, under the leadership of King Kolairein, launched a revolutionary war. However, due to the overwhelming disparity in strength, the Kolairein Kingdom finally perished in the final, tragic resistance against the British. However, the current prince has reversed course, practicing pro-British policies, providing the British with a 2,000-strong contingent of Manipur native troops, willingly recognizing the thief as their father and acting as an accomplice to the tiger.</p>
<p>However, the indigenous people all admire the legacy of King Kolairein, and anti-British sentiments in their hearts are gradually rising. Now, after the Japanese-Indian forces entered India, they have come to welcome them. They have been heavily conscripted and extorted by the British army, and have reached a state of exhaustion. However, they still use their limited sugar and sheep's milk to comfort the Japanese soldiers after their busy military life.</p>
<p>Chin People are Brave and Fierce</p>
<p>The Chin people live in the dense forests from the Chin Hills of Burma to the southeastern mountainous areas of Assam. They are also known as "Naga," which means "naked" in Hindi. In fact, they are similar to the Papuans of New Guinea and the Polynesians. They are warlike and fear shooting. They are able to take objects in the shadows of the dense forest with perfect accuracy. When the reporter passed through the Naga people's residential area, I felt a little uneasy.</p>
<p>The youth of this tribe take pride in wearing ornaments made of shells around their waists. It is said that the number of shells is related to marriage. The Chin people worship ghosts and gods, and they do not marry until men and women have equally distributed their property. There are countless strange customs like these. I will now record one interesting item: "Dog Rice."</p>
<p>Dog Rice Used as a Delicacy</p>
<p>That was when we passed ten kilometers beyond the Burmese border into a certain Chin tribe outside of the Khampat region. It happened to be after plundering defeated and残兵. The Chin people signaled to the reporter to be careful of the surrounding area and not to approach. So, the reporter gave a handful of salt to a young man and asked for permission. With great difficulty, the cordon was opened, and they led the reporter and his party to the chief's residence. The so-called chief's residence was a dug-out hut with a roof thatched with withered leaves, just enough to keep out the rain. The chief invited us to drink strong liquor and, in order to entertain the honored guests from the east, presented a delicacy that was rolling and moving, and I didn't know what it was. I took a bite and found it had a strange taste. I couldn't help but exclaim "Wonderful!" The chief was very proud to see my expression of praise. The soldier translating next to me explained to me that this was the Chin people's delicacy "Dog Rice." Dog Rice is made by taking a young dog, not feeding it all day, and then suddenly giving it a large amount of rice at a certain time. After it finishes eating, it is immediately killed, roasted on a fire, and the cooked rice in its stomach is eaten. After enjoying the meal, the reporter was very grateful for the chief's hospitality. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Ministry of Interior's Recent Work Focuses on Eliminating Opium Addiction; There are a Total of Thirteen Local Anti-Opium Bureaus <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) — The Ministry of Interior met with Chinese and foreign reporters in the capital at 3:00 p.m. yesterday (the 10th). As Minister Mei was in Shanghai on official business, Chief Secretary Pan E'nian represented him at the meeting and gave an overview of the ministry's recent work. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: The most important work of the ministry recently is to handle opium suppression. Regarding opium suppression work, we will certainly follow the government's intentions and strictly implement it in order to achieve the goal of eliminating opium addiction. As for the principles of opium suppression, Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Interior has already mentioned them to you some time ago, so I will not repeat them here. I will only briefly report on three points regarding opium suppression: administration, operations, and personnel.</p>
<p>Administrative Aspect</p>
<p>In terms of opium suppression administration, the ministry has established a Central Anti-Opium Bureau, and local anti-opium bureaus have been established in various places. The local anti-opium bureaus have established offices within their jurisdiction to show their special responsibility. There are a total of thirteen local anti-opium bureaus and seventy-five offices. The (thirteen) anti-opium bureaus are: (Nanjing District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Nanjing City, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Jurong, Jiangning, Lishui, Gaochun. Shanghai District Local Anti-Opium Bureau, offices include Shanghai City. (Suzhou District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wu County, Taicang, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan. (Wuxi District Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wuxi, Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing. (Zhenjiang District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jintan, Yangzhong. (Yangzhou District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Jiangdu, Tianchang, Yizheng, Gaoyou, Baoying, Xinghua, Taixian, Dongtai, Yancheng. (Nantong District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Jingjiang, Qidong, Taixing. (Songjiang District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan. (Jiaxing District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Jiaxing, Jiashan, Pinghu, Chongde, Tongxiang, Haiyan, Wuxing, Yuhang, Changxing, Jinhua, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Deqing, Wukang. (Wuhu District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Wuhu, Huaining, Tongling, Dangtu, Chaoxian, Hanshan, Hexian, Hefei. (Bengbu District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Bengbu, Chuxian, Jiashan, Huaiyuan, Wuhe. (Ningbo District Local Anti-Opium Bureau), offices include Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Shangyu, Zhenhai, Xiangshan. (In addition, an Anti-Opium Accounting Office has been established to manage the accounting affairs of the local anti-opium bureaus.)</p>
<p>Operational Aspect</p>
<p>Operationally, opium smokers are ordered to quit within three years. Opium smokers under the age of thirty are required to quit by March 29 of next year. Opium smokers between the ages of thirty-one and fifty are required to quit by March 29 of (35). Opium smokers (fifty-one years) and above are required to quit by March 29 of (36). Opium dens in various places have been completely closed in the capital. Shanghai is required to close them by June 30 of this year, and cities with local anti-opium bureaus are required to close them completely by June 30 and December 30.</p>
<p>Personnel Aspect</p>
<p>In terms of personnel, the candidates for the heads of the Central Anti-Opium Bureau, local anti-opium bureaus, and offices in various places are recommended from various parties who have no known addiction and are usually honest, and they are appointed separately. The above is a general overview of the ministry's recent opium suppression work.</p>
<p>Secondly, the ministry believes that cultivating good county magistrate personnel is essential for cleansing the government, so it has specifically changed the former County Administration Personnel Training Institute into the County Magistrate Training Institute to specialize in training county magistrate talents. Enrollment will begin soon. The qualifications for application require a degree in political economy or law from a university and three years or more of service in a recommended position.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the ministry has successively accepted the land and houses of non-resident owners transferred by the allied Japanese, totaling over 3,900 cases. There are 523 cases in Nanjing, 23 cases in Shimonoseki, 41 cases in Bengbu, 50 cases in Jinnan, 190 cases in Wuhu, 128 cases in Anqing, 158 cases in Luzhou, 26 cases in Changshu, 73 cases in Wuxi, 268 cases in Changzhou, 35 cases in Nantong, 129 cases in Hangzhou, 36 cases in Huzhou, 50 cases in Jiaxing, 57 cases in Ningbo, 35 cases in Jinhua, 93 cases in Yangzhou, 100 cases in Zhenjiang, 70 cases in Taixian, 25 cases in Danyang, 535 cases in Shanghai, and 98 cases in Xuzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e13">A GlimPSE OF THE CAPITAL'S STREETS, FILLED WITH A DETERMINED SPIRIT <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Three Prohibitions Movement Against Smoking, Gambling, and Dancing Takes Effect</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) – Since the Central Government's return to Nanjing, the capital has been rapidly revitalized. The city is flourishing, and various construction projects are progressing by leaps and bounds. After the National Government joined the war, Nanjing appeared on the East Asian stage in a wartime posture. Hundreds of thousands of citizens have become participants in the Greater East Asia War, each striving to fulfill their duties to defend East Asia and restore China. Recently, the general public has been filled with even greater enthusiasm for defeating Britain and the United States to complete the Greater East Asia War. In particular, the determination to fight to the end is most evident in the streets and alleys. Women are emulating Japanese women, wearing "monpe" trousers. Those who perm their hair and powder their faces are becoming fewer and fewer. Young people dressed in the black uniforms of the Youth Model Corps fill the streets. Citizens, regardless of age or gender, respectfully bow to the statue of the Founding Father as they pass through Xin Jiekou Square. Restaurants generally do not serve alcohol to customers, giving people a sense of being in a different world. Furthermore, Nanjing has implemented blackout regulations since March, and public order is excellent. Residents are thoroughly implementing the blackout regulations, and every household along the street has dug air-raid shelters. Citizens believe in cooperating with the agricultural production increase movement and are planting grains and vegetables in the vacant land in front of their homes, turning the entire Nanjing area into a rural landscape. Now, the people of Nanjing and Japan are working hand in hand, becoming comrades-in-arms, and studying each other's languages. The Japanese Embassy in China opened a Chinese language school within the embassy on April 1st, with the ambassador himself serving as the principal. At the same time, the authorities, starting from April 1st, are eliminating the bad habit of opium smoking. They have begun registering opium smokers, closing illegal opium dens, and reporting those who illegally sell opium. The Three Prohibitions movement against smoking, dancing, and gambling has received great support from young people and is progressing smoothly. The cultural and medical circles of Nanjing are working hard to prepare for the Greater East Asia Cultural Conference and the Greater East Asia Medical Conference, which will be held in Nanjing in May. It is expected that China's determination to fight will be further enhanced by the unity of the Greater East Asia cultural and medical circles. Furthermore, a new cultural cinema has been added in Nanjing this week. All of this fully reflects the war spirit of the general public in Nanjing. In summary, it can be seen that the situation in Nanjing is vastly different from what it was two or three years ago and is filled with enthusiasm for defending East Asia and restoring China.</p>
<h3 id="e14">HULL BROADCASTS WARNING TO NEUTRAL COUNTRIES <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: According to news from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull broadcast last night, warning neutral countries not to supply Axis countries any longer. He stated that many neutral countries are using anti-Axis resources on one hand while assisting in killing anti-Axis soldiers on the other. The anti-Axis forces can no longer tolerate this attitude. The United States highly respects the sovereignty of neutral countries and has never forced a small country to join the anti-Axis side in this war.</p>
<p>Expressing Attitudes on French-Italian Issues</p>
<p>Hull also stated that the French Committee of National Liberation could not be regarded as the government of France and therefore could not be recognized. What the United States is concerned with in Italy is attempting to help organize a free and democratic government, which cannot compromise with Fascism, but the development of the situation in Italy has not met the expectations of the United States. The policy towards Italy set at the Moscow Conference has been properly implemented by the British, American, and Soviet governments, with only the part about democratizing the Italian government not yet realized.</p>
<p>Relations Between Countries Need Urgent Adjustment</p>
<p>To seek lasting peace, there must be a genuine adjustment of the organized action of the anti-Axis countries and the basis of international relations. As for the Atlantic Charter and the declarations of the Moscow, Cairo, and Tehran conferences, they did not propose ways to solve various problems. The Atlantic Charter only stated basic goals. The United States is still willing to act as a mediator between the Soviet Union and Poland.</p>
<h3 id="e15">GERMANY WITHDRAWS FROM ODESSA ACCORDING TO PLAN <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Defensive and Offensive War Unfolds in Crimea</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, citing a German official war report, stated: Soviet forces have expanded their offensives on the Syvash bridgehead and the Perekop Isthmus on the Crimean Peninsula and have penetrated several points of the German line. Fierce enemy engagements are underway. German forces are still conducting fierce defensive battles in the Odessa region. After weeks of preparation, destroying all military facilities, and removing wheel vessels, tanks, and other wartime materials, German forces have withdrawn from the city of Odessa to carry out a planned withdrawal. Soviet forces attacked near Orhei (in northeastern Romania), but were unsuccessful. During the counterattack, German forces leveled the sunken areas of the positions. East of Bukovina (in Romania), German-Romanian allied forces yesterday again blocked the enemy's advance on the Uzhok Pass line. The German garrison in Ternopol within the former Polish border is engaged in fierce street fighting with the invading enemy.</p>
<h3 id="e16">FRICTIONS BETWEEN BRITAIN AND AMERICA IN THE RECENT WAR SITUATION – BROADCAST SPEECH BY CAPTAIN SHIODA YESTERDAY TO THE PEOPLE OF NIHONBASHI <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Nimitz fleet, which the enemy, the United States, has been clamoring about for a long time as the southern invasion route against Japan, is now doing its utmost to bomb and invade, attempting to fly over Truk and the Caroline Islands, via Manila, and land in southern China. Their strategy is to cut our mainland and southern regions in two.</p>
<p>On the other hand, under the command of Mountbatten, British forces are trying to retake Burma, Thailand, and Vietnam. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, together with the Chongqing Air Force, totaling hundreds of aircraft, is launching guerrilla warfare against our ships sailing in the Yangtze River basin and the South China Sea. In particular, recently, they have increased the number of bombers, which is noteworthy. These U.S. Air Forces are watching for opportunities to act in northern Vietnam and are cooperating with the British forces in Burma in their operations. In the battle to occupy Cassino, they faced fierce resistance from the German forces and are still trying to carry out a breakthrough operation. Following the progress of the war situation, they also want to establish a second front in the Balkans.</p>
<p>Soviet forces crossed the Dniester River and entered Bessarabia, planning to adopt the strategy used in the Donbas region. The air war between the German and British forces is becoming more frequent. Recently, Britain and the United States, using joint forces, have attempted to destroy production facilities in Berlin, northern France, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the current world war situation relies solely on the material strength of the United States as the only force. Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and their allies maintain very close strategic methods.</p>
<p>The impression we get is that Britain and the Soviet Union are mutually assisting each other with their military and economic power. In terms of troop organization, the British and American forces are even becoming integrated. However, behind the scenes, the three countries have different dreams and are eager to gain their own speaking rights and interests, resulting in fierce disputes.</p>
<p>At the end of March, Roosevelt answered reporters, saying: "In the war against Japan, the British and American forces have each set up assigned areas. The U.S. fleet is solely responsible for the Pacific theater, while Britain is responsible for the Indian Ocean." In this answer, he revealed his first-class diplomatic rhetoric.</p>
<p>In each front, the U.S. military often leads the British military. The territory of the British Empire, which was once scattered across the seven seas, is now completely invaded and trampled upon by the U.S. military. The British territory of New Britain Island was once announced to be transferred to the United States. Canada, New Zealand, and Australia are in fact already U.S. territories.</p>
<p>The United States increases its voice in India</p>
<p>Furthermore, before and after the battle to retake Burma, the United States dispatched land forces from the Pacific to the Burmese front, dispatched a flight squadron to India, and strengthened the Stilwell U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. As a result, the United States' voice in India has greatly increased. This point painfully pricked the nerves of the British and the British military leaders who were worried about the war and the invasion of India. For Britain, even if it lost most of its overseas colonies, it could not tolerate a major blow if the U.S. military only verbally invaded India, which is known as the crown of the British colonial empire. Given this, in the enemy's counter-offensive operation in Burma, Stilwell's intervention in Mountbatten's operations revealed the inconsistency of British and American operations. A spokesperson in Chongqing also raised this issue.</p>
<p>Chongqing, whose lifeline is held by the U.S. military, is good at understanding the intentions of the United States and stated: "The British military's operations have hardly achieved anything." Chongqing's newspapers even criticized, saying, "Britain should abandon the difficult land operations and organize a powerful fleet to attack Singapore from the sea."</p>
<p>Roosevelt said, "The Indian Ocean is entrusted to the British fleet," which secretly meant, "The United States will not extend its power to India, the lifeline of Britain," wanting to reassure the anxious British. However, the reality is completely the opposite.</p>
<p>Nimitz's grand plan to use the Chinese mainland as a base for a counter-offensive against Japan is to place China and India under U.S. control.</p>
<p>The most pitiful person is Mountbatten. Boasting that he would retake Burma and promoting his strategy and military power, Mountbatten, who solemnly took office as the commander-in-chief of the Southeast Asian Army, has the U.S. military, which is encroaching on territory, and the anti-British Indian people internally, and the fierce attacks of the Japanese army externally. His plight can be imagined. Of course, Britain has gathered a portion of its fleet in the Indian Ocean, but it does not have sufficient resources and strength to attack our Singapore.</p>
<p>The U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, under Stilwell, is waiting for an opportunity to respond to Nimitz's offensive. The U.S. military stationed in Chongqing, with an overwhelming force compared to the Soviet Union and Britain, controls the lifeline of Chongqing. Therefore, Chongqing has recently dared to not cooperate with the Soviet Union. Furthermore, there was a conflict between the Chongqing army in Xinjiang Province and the Mongolian army, which was criticized by the Soviet Union. Chongqing proclaimed that it was exclusively cooperating closely with Britain and the United States, but in reality, the relationship between the United States and Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union, with Chongqing as the center, is extremely delicate.</p>
<p>The Chongqing leadership admires the large-scale offensive operations of the U.S. fleet in the Palau operation, or praises the strengthening of Chongqing's cooperation with the Allied forces, and sends delegations to the United States, wanting to cater to the United States at the expense of its own soldiers and endure the tyranny of the U.S. Air Force. However, some self-aware people in Chongqing believe that from the perspective of China's long-term plan, it is definitely not beneficial to allow the U.S. military to invade China. Moreover, this enthusiastic praise of the U.S. military in Chongqing is not appreciated in the United States at all, because the United States does not believe that it is fighting with Chongqing on an equal footing. Their goal is only how to achieve their own ambitions in China.</p>
<p>Last year, Stilwell incorporated the weak Chongqing Air Force into his own department, gaining great speaking rights, such as establishing infantry schools or training Chongqing troops, etc. The influence of the United States is increasing day by day. In the eyes of the United States, there is no longer Britain, and there is no longer the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The United States Exclusively Occupies Near East Interests</p>
<p>Secondly, in the Near East, in places such as Iran, Iraq, and Arabia, which are completely British territories, the United States, despite British opposition, established a plan to monopolize Arabian oil and wanted to install oil pipelines.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Britain has no oil fields in its own country. Therefore, Arabian oil can almost be said to be its lifeline today. The United States wants to cut off this lifeline of Britain. This matter was immediately transmitted to London, and Eden said in Parliament: "The Allied United States, regarding this matter, perhaps will notify Britain in advance!" He hoped to consult with Britain. However, the American Knox immediately said: "The extraction of Arabian oil is entirely due to the operational needs of the U.S. Navy." He completely overturned Eden's hope. Not only is the Arabian oil issue, there are many issues that are unresolved and affect the relationship between the two countries in the feelings. Therefore, Eden talked about the oil issue in Parliament, and Knox replied like this. Furthermore, a few days ago, when 38 small aircraft carriers were transferred to Britain, Knox also refuted.</p>
<p>The dying British region, due to the many assistance from the United States, the United States is gradually seizing British rights and interests, making Britain at a loss. In addition, the Soviet Union also wants to get involved, send troops in and out of the Near East, and wants to launch a Balkan operation.</p>
<p>Reuters' special correspondent in Chongqing issued a warning to Britain, saying: "The Soviet Union's most zealous research goal is to enter Central Asia."</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, the dispute between Britain and the United States, with the strategy of the war against Germany and the establishment of a second front as the center, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union mutually want to obtain favorable speaking rights.</p>
<p>In order to advance the European counter-offensive operation, the British and American forces established the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Expeditionary Force in January, but the commander, Eisenhower, and the chief of staff, Smith, were both Americans. That is, the Mediterranean operations that Britain is most focused on are also controlled by the U.S. commanders.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union knows that there is a lot of damage and difficulty in the British counter-offensive against Germany, so it advocates Pan-Slavism and directs its main force towards the Balkans, entering Romania. Furthermore, although the Soviet Union frequently asked Britain and the United States to complete the second front as soon as possible, Britain and the United States hoped that Germany and the Soviet Union would be defeated and injured, and did not lightly agree. Even among the two countries, Britain does not like the United States entering the Balkans, so the relationship between the three countries, centered on the Balkan countries, is also extremely delicate.</p>
<p>So what about Britain? Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in Britain. How will the so-called high-spirited British people view the U.S. military's intrusion into their own homes?</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Hull asked the Republic of Ireland, which is close to Britain, to remove Japanese and German officials. Britain did not express anything about Hull's words.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the war situation in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic, the United States completely holds the priority. In the middle of this, Britain is doing its utmost to prevent the invasion of the United States, eager to recover its own strength and preserve its main territory.</p>
<p>The Future of Britain is Bleak</p>
<p>Britain cannot but be aware now that the United States, which it has always trusted and relied on for help, is unexpectedly the most dangerous existence. Therefore, Britain now has no hope except to retain something with the status of a victor.</p>
<p>German Propaganda Minister Goebbels had an article in the Great German Newspaper saying:</p>
<p>"Britain, which entered this great war by tragic mistake, what hope is there for continuing the war? Assuming that defeating Germany succeeds, Britain will be engulfed in the flood of communism, and from a realistic point of view, Britain may have to implement a landing operation in the near future, but at that time, Britain will be beaten so that it cannot straighten its back, and this is already a foregone conclusion."</p>
<p>When observing the friction between Britain and the United States, centered on the war situation mentioned above, the tragedy of Britain is progressing with time. For example, if Britain gets 81% of the weapons lent by the United States to the Allied countries, then on the other hand, the losses taken away by the United States are also as considerable as this ratio.</p>

<p>Central News Agency – National Government Committee member and concurrently Special Envoy and Plenipotentiary Ambassador Chen Jicheng returned to the country this time to participate in the National Government's return to the capital commemoration. He was warmly received by Chairman Wang of North China and Japanese Minister Izawa in Tianjin, and Mayor Zhang of Tianjin. After arriving in Beijing, he also attended important banquets hosted by Foreign Minister Chu, Interior Minister Mei, Mayor Zhou, Allied Ambassador Guth, and Manchukuo Ambassador Lu, which were very busy. Ambassador Chen has been in Manchuria for a year, and the friendship between China and Manchuria is becoming increasingly close. He has paid particular attention to the special progress in production increase in recent years. He will introduce the advantages of that country to the people of the country to serve as a reference for increasing production through lectures and symposiums in Beijing. The reporter specially visited Ambassador Chen at his private residence in western Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The main points of his conversation are recorded as follows: The people of Manchukuo have a stable life and established public security amidst the worldwide turmoil, which is commendable. In the past two years, the Greater East Asia War has progressed in stages, and the abundance of materials is the biggest factor in obtaining victory. Manchukuo is a major base for supplying these materials, greatly increasing agricultural and mining industries, and strictly implementing controls. Young people throughout the country are also given wartime training to cultivate the national spirit of fighting to the end. The defense of the northern border is as solid as a rock. Its contribution to completing the Greater East Asia War is great, and there is much that can be learned from it by our country. This time, I returned to the country to participate in the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and will have to return to my post soon. I will also devote myself to the exchange of materials and economic cooperation between China and Manchuria and will study and investigate the special advantages of Manchuria's industrial production increase as much as possible to introduce them to the authorities of our country, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e22">COMMENTS ON THE ONE-YUAN DONATION MOVEMENT FOR CITIZENS BY CAPTAIN SHIODA – THE FUTURE OF SINO-JAPANESE COOPERATION IS BRIGHT <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>In order to express our enthusiasm for supporting the Greater East Asia War, Mayor Chen launched the One-Yuan Donation Movement for citizens in elementary and secondary schools in this city, starting from the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. As of now, more than 10,000 yuan has been raised, of which a portion of 2,500 yuan was presented to the Japanese Naval Attaché Office and the News Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China on the 8th. Captain Takamichi Shioda gave the following comments to reporters yesterday when he met them:</p>
<p>"Chinese youths are able to recognize the great significance of the Greater East Asia War and are working hard to enhance combat power at all times and in all places. This is deeply moving to us. The aircraft donation movement by elementary and secondary school students in this city is also a manifestation of this spirit, and we are extremely pleased. If the spirit of these innocent youths can be thorough, it will give great brightness to the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation.</p>
<p>Japanese expatriates in China, in order to adapt to the country's decisive emergency measures, are giving up their individual selves and contributing everything to enhance national combat power. For example, when a naming ceremony for aircraft donated to the army and navy was held in Hangzhou the other day, a lecture meeting was held. When News Minister Matsushima reported on the current war situation, the audience was moved and donated 14,000 yuan. Furthermore, when the movie "Decisive Battle in the Sky" was screened for knowledgeable people on the Chinese side, they were able to recognize the reality of Japan's air power, and all were extremely excited and wrote articles expressing their feelings. As described above, the efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people with the same spirit to strengthen the combat power of the Axis are truly moving to the Japanese Navy," he said.</p>

<p>Prohibition of Lewd Plays: Recently, some theatrical troupes in this city have been competing to perform obscene plays such as "Butterfly Dream" (i.e., Slicing the Coffin) and "Spinning Cotton." Because their words and phrases are vulgar and their forms are vile, they are harmful to social morality and corrupt the people's minds. Therefore, the Administrative Office of the First Police Bureau of this city will ban and prohibit them to purify the people's minds and maintain discipline.</p>
<p>Economic Circles: Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e29">Third Discussion on Economic Police <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the economic police, we have repeatedly discussed them, because the primary defect of the wartime controlled economy is the lack of order and discipline, leading to rampant profiteering and speculation, which is beyond control. As a result, the entire people's livelihood is heading towards a dead end. What a serious problem this is! Under the unified step of the current government authorities to severely crack down on speculation and curb price increases, the imminent establishment of the new Economic Police Department has already demonstrated its preemptive power, because the complexity of Shanghai's economic maladies is like tangled hemp, which cannot be cut without a sharp knife, and the new economic police organization is a sharp knife to eliminate corruption in Shanghai's economic circles.</p>
<p>We have already stated the various essential conditions that the economic police should possess, so there is no need to repeat them. In addition to repeatedly discussing the issue of economic police, we hope to awaken the authorities to pay special attention to the Japanese economic police system and study and refer to it. What we can learn from it in terms of organization is merely mechanical and does not differ. Although we cannot list them due to space limitations, we must especially recognize the guiding principles of the Japanese economic police. Since January of the 16th year of Showa (the 30th year of the Republic of China), the guiding principles of the Japanese economic police have focused on the unhindered implementation of control swords. However, since the Greater East Asia War, in order to cope with the extremely severe war situation at this stage, special attention has been paid to: assisting the increase of productivity and transportation capacity, safeguarding the wartime life of the people, and eradicating malignant incidents that affect the war effort or endanger the people's lives. Regarding the third item, there have recently been more substantial and thorough measures in guiding and cracking down on economic crimes. From this, we can know the position of the economic police and their wartime mission.</p>

At present, the fundraising and cooperative affairs are actively being prepared and progressing. Moreover, the location of the cooperative has also been finalized.

<h3 id="e31">After Cooperation and Adjustment, New Face of Huaihai Province; Interview with Information Department Chief Matsudaira <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Information Department Chief Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai met with Chinese newspaper reporters in this city at the regular meeting on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel yesterday (the 10th) afternoon. He made the following statement regarding the cooperation and adjustment of various aspects of Huaihai Province by the Allied authorities:</p>
<p>"The Huaihai Province was formerly known as the Su-Huai Special District. Since the National Government returned to Nanjing, it has been under the jurisdiction of the North China Political Affairs Commission. Since it was directly under the central government two years ago, with the cooperation of Japan, the local agencies and their command systems have been gradually changed. By last year, various popular organizations were also gradually adjusted. For example, last year, the Central News Agency established a branch in Xuzhou, and the original branch of the China News Agency was cancelled. The Xuzhou branch of the Allied News Agency was also placed under the jurisdiction of the Central China General Bureau. At the same time, the Japanese-language "East Asia New Daily" in Xuzhou was changed to the Xuzhou branch of the Continental New Daily on February 1 this year and continued to be published. In addition, the Chinese-language Xuzhou Daily, formerly supplied with paper and other printing materials by North China, will be supplied by Central China from April 1 this year. In addition, the scope of activities of Sino-Japanese joint ventures,</p>
<p>Joint Ventures</p>
<p>also changed. The directors and shareholders of Sino-Japanese joint ventures were also uniformly adjusted with the full cooperation of both parties. For example, the railway from Xuzhou to Bengbu will be under the unified jurisdiction of the Central China Railway Company after April 1. Local telephone and telegraph services will also be operated by the Central China Electric Communications Company. The former North China Broadcasting Association's broadcasting in Xuzhou will be managed by the China Broadcasting Association. Except for agencies directly related to the Japanese side, other agencies will be generally adjusted.</p>
<p>Unified Currency</p>
<p>The currency issue in the province has been explained by Finance Minister Zhou in his statement. From April 10, the Central Reserve Bank note will be the standard currency and will be fully exchanged to unify the currency. Regarding the calculation of this currency, Japan, based on the spirit of cooperating with China, has also notified local shops and agencies to uniformly change to the Central Reserve Bank note as the unit currency, and to follow the National Government's policies and make adjustments.</p>
<p>In short, the province's politics were adjusted two years ago, and now economic and cultural aspects will be adjusted to connect with Shanghai's economy in the future. At the same time, it will be an important town for the National Government to revitalize the economy and develop resources. We deeply hope that after this thorough adjustment, both parties can cooperate further to complete the victory of the war."</p>

<h3 id="e32">Killing Two Birds with One Stone <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Living a wartime life during wartime is an obligation that everyone should abide by. The so-called saving on consumption refers to consuming properly, but saving to the minimum extent possible. If it is "extravagance" and "waste" beyond consumption, then it is fundamentally not within the proper scope, and it is definitely not effective to use persuasive methods to save. It is simply necessary to use prohibition and suppression methods to make it no longer exist.</p>
<p>Chinese-style gambling has been banned, and the business hours of dance halls have been restricted. This shows that the authorities are determined to prohibit and suppress "extravagance" and "waste" beyond proper consumption. However, there are more than 40 dance schools in Shanghai that hang up the sign of learning ballroom dancing but are actually dance halls in disguise. Because they have the sign of a school, the time is flexible, and entry and exit are free. It is a medium for inducing young men and women to degenerate and get by, a trap. Waste of money already violates wartime life, and demoralization is especially a fatal blow to national strength.</p>
<p>Secondly, there are more than 100 singing girl agencies and guide agencies in Shanghai, which hang up the signs of singing and guiding and use women's occupations as bait to recruit nearly 10,000 young women through oppression and threats, causing them to sink into depravity. The agency owners sit back and reap the profits. As a result, they fill hotels, gamble and revel, and the three become one, forming a prosperous city with extravagant customs, which is especially contrary to wartime life.</p>
<p>In this decisive era of innovation, it is hoped that the police authorities will further pay attention to it and correct this unreasonable phenomenon as soon as possible. As for the issue of the singing girls' way out, in this year of increased production, in an environment where power machinery is restricted, the promotion of handicrafts is necessary. It is hoped that entrepreneurs will transfer part of their strength in real estate and stocks to establish handicrafts, recruit and train these women to engage in production work. This can not only help solve social problems but also promote production, which is also a way to kill two birds with one stone. I believe that major entrepreneurs will not ignore it!</p>

<p>The authorities are taking increasingly strict steps to manage the operation of major commodities, absolutely prohibiting merchants from raising prices arbitrarily for profit or illegally hoarding and speculation, in order to balance the supply of spot goods. It was learned yesterday that the authorities have decided to effectively adjust the organizational structure of trade associations for major commodities in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on the Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, so as to make the organization sound and seek the welfare of the industry. All trade associations for these major commodities must prepare a membership list in accordance with the law and submit it to the relevant authorities for verification. The items to be listed are: member brand name, name of the person in charge, location of business, type of commodity being operated, date of approval registration, registration certificate number, total capital, business policy, business status, telephone number, etc. At the same time, members of each trade association, whether they are specialized or concurrent operators, must report the purchase and sale situation to their respective trade association every ten days. The trade association will prepare a roster at the end of each month and submit it to the relevant authorities for reference, including: the quantity and price of goods purchased, and the name of the merchant from whom they were purchased; the quantity and price of goods sold, and the name of the merchant to whom they were sold; the amount of goods stored; the location of storage; the detailed address and telephone number of the merchant; and the name of the person in charge or manager. Those who violate the regulations will be subject to a huge fine.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Association Distributes Raw Materials to Members <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The Cake, Steamed Bun, and Fried Dough Association of this city began distributing raw materials required by members yesterday. The flour allocation for the third phase of members in the Huxi, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong districts was stipulated by the Shanghai Industry Bureau and the Bran Unified Distribution Office to be four bags per household. The respective recipients have now stamped and collected them. The association's recent allocation of salt will also be distributed by district on the 13th, and it is announced that no one may privately profit from the allocated materials. In addition, the association has moved its office to No. 11, Lane 118, Datongzhong 3, because the original address was insufficient for use.</p>

<h3 id="e40">The Issue of Candidates for the Municipal Political Consultation Committee <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Guangzhen</p>
<p>The upcoming establishment of the Municipal Political Consultation Committee can be said to be the prelude to a civil opinion organization, and can also be said to be the preparation for citizens to participate in politics. If this is the case, then the members of the Consultation Committee bear the responsibility of Shanghai's municipal administration and receive the entrustment of millions of citizens. The difficulty of their burden and the importance of their mission cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Before the names of the committee members are announced, we should first review the candidates for the committee. Based on the previous precedents of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Senate, the members of this Consultation Committee will be largely the same. However, why did the Municipal Council and the Senate not achieve much success at that time? In short, the selection of committee members placed too much emphasis on reputation. As a result, the committee members and the citizens were still separated, the lower intentions could not reach the top, the upper instructions were difficult to implement as scheduled, and the establishment of civil opinion organizations was only in name and not in reality.</p>
<p>The selection of members for the current Consultation Committee should abandon the system of inviting based on reputation and emphasize academic knowledge and experience. Within the possible scope, it should extend to urban areas, expand to rural and remote areas, and recruit talented people in the countryside to serve, so as to be closer to the people and easier to implement policies.</p>
<p>The number of members of this Consultation Committee should be greatly expanded. The selection of members should adopt a recommendation system, with one member produced by one Lianbao (joint guarantee), one town, one village, or one district. This is the need of the environment and the expectation of the citizens.</p>
<h3 id="e41">A Tour of the New Puyu Hall <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Xin</p>
<p>The New Puyu Hall has quite perfect facilities. Middle and lower class families are not as good as it, and there are not many upper-class families. In addition, they use scientific management methods. Everything is really analyzed very clearly, and everywhere shows that there is spirit and steps. At the same time, they think about saving money in terms of expenditure. For example, they grow their own vegetables, raise their own pigs, and in terms of medicines, in addition to a small number of donations from all walks of life, they buy their own raw materials and manufacture them themselves (undertaken by a nun who once studied as a pharmacist). At the same time, they not only pay attention to saving, but also open up new sources of income. For example, work-study students can embroider, cross-stitch, weave socks, weave nets, weave cloth bags, etc. For elderly women, if they can sew, repair broken clothes, sew buttons, etc., although the production income is very small, it is still a small supplement. Everyone who is sheltered receives free clothing, food, and housing. The aim is to enable the young to grow up and the old to have an end. Clothing, food, education, and medicine are advanced at the same time.</p>
<p>Although the hall was founded by the late philanthropist Lu Bohong, who devoted his life to it (currently succeeded by Lu's son), the sisters of the Charity Society of the Catholic Church assist in handling all internal work. They sacrifice their own happiness to seek happiness for orphaned children and treat it as their own comfort. That kind of great spirit of sacrifice really inspires admiration and respect.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sky and Sea (7)</p>
<p>The fleet's home port is Yokosuka. Before returning to Yokosuka, they passed by Futami, so they visited the Ise Grand Shrine, which was of great significance to them. Rather than discussing the national power a hundred times, it is more meaningful to visit the shrine once—at least that's what Makoto thought. And during the anchorage in Futami, the annual routine grand review was held.</p>
<p>From Futami to Yokosuka, this is the last route for inshore navigation. For Makoto, this was the first trip to the East China Sea since he was born. When he thought that the ancestors of the samurai came from Kura, he couldn't help but feel a sense of reluctance for the boundless blue sea.</p>
<p>When the warship was sailing in Shimizu Chong, Makoto finished dinner and ran to the rear deck alone. The white, green, and red navigation lights had already emitted faint rays of light. He suddenly discovered something amazing on the western land.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mount Fuji!"</p>
<p>It was a very foggy day, but fortunately it was blown clear by the wind, allowing him to see Mount Fuji. This Mount Fuji, apart from admiring it in photos and pictures, had never been seen with his own eyes, but the scenery of the mountain had long been known. Whether there was fog or not, he couldn't tell, but it looked like a beautiful silhouette. He only felt that there was an emotion in his heart that made him worship him. Makoto saw Mount Fuji and immediately felt that he had arrived in the center of Japan. So he thought of the inland navigation practice that would be completed tomorrow.</p>
<p>The two months of sailing allowed him to discover the vastness of Japan. At the same time, it made him understand what life was like in the ship. It also made him know the work, responsibility, and attitude of the officers. As for the grace and power of the instructors, it was deeply imprinted in his mind.</p>
<p>(However, what was the biggest experience among them?) Makoto shook his head.</p>
<p>(Ah, I know, I have subordinates.)</p>
<p>This was the first time he had approached non-commissioned officers and soldiers. The first time he felt emotions for his subordinates. As for the responsibility of superiors, he also realized it for the first time. This was Makoto's conclusion.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Vocational Training Class Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The vocational training class commissioned by the Social Service Department of this newspaper to be handled by Hualian Middle School was held yesterday afternoon at 6:00 pm at the school. Principal Chen Tianyu first reported on the preparation process. Mr. Huang Jingwan from this newspaper personally went to give a speech, saying in brief: "In order to meet the urgent needs of the times and assist high school graduates who have received scholarships to find employment, and to provide appropriate training in simple living skills, this newspaper has specially commissioned Hualian Middle School to first run the technical aspects of commercial applications, temporarily suspending three months as a period, which is a new experiment." And put forward three standards: in terms of intention, such as loyalty, forgiveness, faith, love, integrity, sincerity, perseverance, and impartiality. In terms of behavior, such as being willing to discuss, being cautious, removing what is bad, being quick, accurate, diligent, courteous, incorruptible, concise, and refined. In terms of life, such as discipline, artistry, populism, groupism, love, unity, and mutual help, I hope everyone can learn and apply them.</p>
<p>Guests such as Lu Buru, Yang Changzhi, and Hu Yuqing gave many words of encouragement, energized their spirits, and studied earnestly. More than 40 people participated in the training, most of whom were young people from various schools who had completed high school this year and were about to enter the workforce. They were full of energy, and the teachers were all well-known figures. If this pilot project achieves excellent results, and the participants can obtain practical benefits and contribute to society, the scope can be expanded and continued in the next session.</p>
<h3 id="e44">This Office Newly Established a Document Specialization Office <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The creation of writing lies in achieving the two major purposes of "recording events and conveying meanings." If writing fails to achieve the above-mentioned purposes, then the effect of writing will be diminished. Today, young people who have just left school are often able to write novels and essays of thousands of words, but for practical documents such as letters, official documents, contracts, regulations, etc., what they write does not meet the standards. This is the result of "aiming too high and being too ambitious," rather than what society universally needs. The Social Service Department of this newspaper is aware of this and has specially commissioned Xiuneng Yixiao to run a "Document Specialization School." In addition to the above-mentioned types of courses, the curriculum also includes "Abacus, Improved Chinese Bookkeeping, Regular Script, Document Management Law, Service Morality," and invites those with extensive academic knowledge or teaching at the Shangxiang to be professors, with the aim of cultivating specialized talents in this area in the shortest possible time. Simple regulations are available upon request.</p>
