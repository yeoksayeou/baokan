<h3>旅情</h3>
<p>— 春在</p>
<p>這一次，我得到一個旅行的機會，由南海一隅的村市—廣州灣啓行，乘飛機，經海南島而廣東而台北市而上海，到上海之日，第一個會見的友人，就是申報社社長陳彬龢先生。普通寒暄之後，他向我提出要求，替申報寫一篇文章，因爲老友關係，我不能推却，爲寫[旅情]一篇。　　上海人也許不大知道廣州灣是怎樣的一個地方，因爲廣洲灣比起上海，實在是太小，她只包容得有六萬餘人口，約略言之，她中抵得上海九十分之一，所以我稱她爲村市，各地的村市中人，對於上海，容易知道，上海人對於各地的村市，不容易知道，這是自然的道理。　　我首先要介紹一件廣州灣事情給上海人聽，就是廣州灣未價，這兩年來，始終保持於儲劵二千—乃至二千六百元一石之間，沒有急激上昇過。那是什麼原因呢？　　雷州半島的產米，是可以自由運進廣州灣市的，在那裹的中日當局，對於米糧入市，採取歡迎而給以便利的態度。其次，是廣州灣的重要商人如陳學談賴澤之流，做米糧生意，決不想賺錢，居於一種代市民大量購進平價分售的地位，所以廣州灣市民，始終吃價錢不甚高貴的米。　　我在海南島，經過匆匆，沒有什麼東西可說，在廣州住了兩星期，所見到的，是廣東人民的精神，並沒有因戰爭而頹唐，他們仍是拚命的奔走忙碌，各人謀各人的出路，我佩服廣東人，廣東人有一種艱苦卓絕百折不磨的精神，他們比起在廣州灣的法國人，似乎剛勁勇悍得多，而法國人在廣州灣者，則人人而貌上表示一種旁皇落魄，中心無主的姿態。　　飛機在台北市停了一夜，我和一位同行友人，宿泊於新高旅館，這個旅館，在台北市是第一流的，二人一宿三餐，每餐加菜一味，臨行看賬，使我大吃一驚，我心中計算，一宿三餐，兩個人，必需儲劵二三千元即日金四五百元之譜，但賬單上寫的是二十六元。這，在當初，我以爲是賬房寫漏一個圈，及至重問一遍，方知點劃無訛，正正經經的二十六元。我中國的同胞們？這一點，不是小事，是證明日本政府的力量，大於中國百倍，因爲中國政府所發行的紙幣，在人民生活上，所表現的力量，只有他們的百分之一。拿人家百分之一的力量來講平等合作，我替政府着急。　　所可喜的是中國人民艱難奮鬥的精神，決不在日本人民決死奉公的精神以下，所不同的，是中國人民缺乏信仰心，精神不能集中，發揮爲國，而日本人民則把所有的精神集注在一個信仰之下，爲祖國而萬死不辭。　　由此言之，中國需要政治的革新，國民精神之統合，必須經過這兩段手術，方能達到[建國必成]的目的，而在現今這種情勢之下，我要問：我們在上海的同胞，你們有革新政治的勇氣與[統合精神]的決意嗎？　　在陳先生給我各種刋物中，以吉田東祐先生的文章，最引起我個人的注意。他是一個日本學者，却學會了替中國說話的本領，有一部分中國人，疑心他是說假話的。　　我與吉田先生並不相識，一直到陳先生請我吃飯，才在棹上，替我介紹，我沒有資格，保證他是不是一個說謊者，而且，我只有佩服他而已，並不完全同意他所說的內容，老實說，我以爲他對於中國事情的研究還只有升堂的工夫，並未入室，中國通決不是十年八年所做得成的。　　我有一點，可以代吉田先生向中國同胞作證明的，就是普通的日本人，說謊本領，大抵在普通的中國人水準以下。舉例來說，中國有做賊的人，日本也有做泥棒的人，但是中國的賊被捉到官十個有九個不肯認供；日本的泥棒，只愁你捉不到，假若捉到，十中這九一問即老老實實的認供，這是日本人說謊本領頗爲低下之一證明。其次，中國人有自殺的，日本人也有自殺的，中國人自殺上吊，吞烟，投河；日本人處殺剖腹，跳火山，或睡在鐵道上，讓火車轢死。就兩國人自殺方法而研究，兩國人心理之不同，中國人到死，尚有幾分說謊的意味，含蓄在內，因爲上吊，還可以解繩施救。吞烟，還可以灌胃洗腸。投河，還可以投到漁翁的綱中，打救回生。至若日本人，則一死就死定了，因爲肚皮研開，再縫不攏。火山跳下，　時化灰。火車之下，決無完屍。他們自殺是貸眞價實童叟無欺的自殺，而中國人則含有[黎山老母][救人於危]的希望。死之瞬間尚有一個七折八扣的打算。所以，我以普通日本人說謊本領來測度吉田先生，我相信他所發表的文字，十分八九是出於本心，不是向我們故意賣弄玄虛。　　至於他所說的內容到底對不對，則留待讀者諸君之自由決定，我的旅情一文，在此也暫告結束了。</p>

<p>本市的物價問題，目前實已達到最嚴重的關頭，但是問題錯綜複雜，關係方面又多，不是三言兩語可以說得清楚。然而物價政策的成敗，却可以決定整個統制經濟的成敗，不但關係協力大東亞戰爭的前途影響很大，就是社會治亂的關鍵也在這裹。要保障大東亞戰爭勝利，必須穩定後方的物價，這是大家都已知道的，不用我再來細說了。　　說起來，戰時物價高漲，原是必然趨勢。依照一般的觀察，歸納歷來經濟學專家的觀察，戰時物價上漲的原因，不外乎：一物資生產短缺，來源減少；二貨幣購買力跌落；三人口偏集，供需失却平衡；四交通運輸不便；五商人乘機操縱，囤積居奇；六市塲心理不安，購藏物資，吐出貸幣等等。但是我認爲本市物價的連年暴漲，還有其他特殊原因，不容忽視的。</p>
<h3>三次大風潮</h3>
<p>請就一年間的物價變動的經過來說罷。本人就任以來，在市長的賢明領導之下，對於物價問題，可說日夜關蕁，不斷努力穩定工作的，但是一切努力，仍歸無效的，其中却有三次大風潮。第一次風潮，發生在去年十二月至本年一月，因爲煤炭恐慌，激成了一般物價的狂漲。第二次風潮，是今年五六月間，因爲米價驟然從四五千元暴漲計九千一萬多元，於是又促成一般物價暴漲。第三次便是上個月以來，現在還沒有停止的大風潮了。在這次風潮中，金價的黑市暴漲，限制用電，刺激廠商的恐慌；更有米統會禁米自由入境辦法的一再變動，現在的米類，因此漲出一萬四千餘，煤炭黑市漲出十餘萬元。如此暴漲，說起來實在令人寒心。試想呌一般市民，勤勞階級，如何生活呢？長此下去，前途眞不堪設想。</p>
<h3>努力的失敗</h3>
<p>爲什麼我們的努力，對於這三次暴漲風潮，獨歸無效呢？這理想是很簡單，因爲物價問題，是全面的問題，旣不是一業一物的問題，也不是一地一市的問題，必須集合中央與地方，盟邦朝野與我國官民各業各界，通力合作，一致努力，統盤籌措，才有澈底解決的可能，如果局部統制，最多只能做到頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳的地步。因爲不能根絕病根，只平抑一時，於是病勢便成週期性了，開始壓制的時候，物價暫時停漲，過了一些時候，舊病復發，漲風又開始，來勢而且更凶了。　　不單如此，物價是全面的，整個的，彼此牽連的。假設米價不能平穩，一切商品就不能平穩，但是米價不易單獨平穩，必須其他物價平穩，才可以平穩，假設煤價不能平穩，一切商品就不能平穩，煤價也不可以單獨平穩的，必須其他物價平穩，才能平穩，一切商品物價都可依此類推。因此我們主張管理物價。必須把一切商品的物價，不論是統制品或非統制品，必須同時管理，要評定物價，應該兼顧一般物價水準來評定那末物價管理權，物價平議權，應該集中，應該統一，至少不可以多品各業業的各自管理，各自評議，各自爲政。但是現在的統制制度，似予採行一業甚至一物的分別統制，彼此雖可聯絡，但管理權的分散，終於違反了物價的統一性，因此各各努力於物品價格的穩定，而結果是大家都沒有辦法。我們大家都知道，要穩定物價，必須先穩定生活必需品，但是生活必需品裹最主要的米，麵粉，雜糧，煤油，鹽，糖，火柴，洋燭，麵包，牛奶，肉類，雞蛋，烟草，蔬菜，水果地貨等物品價格，都不是我們的經濟局物價評議會所管得到的。所以在某一次市政府與日本新聞記者開聯絡舍的時候。本人報告物價問題，會經提出這種情形，當時他們都很駭異，都很歎息。但是事實到現在，還是這樣。</p>
<h3>全面的問題</h3>
<p>照一般道理講，物價高漲，生產應該增加，但上海物價高漲，生產反見衰落，這是什麼原因呢？就因爲物價高漲不止，一般人對於貨幣的信仰發生動搖，大家都去囤積原料和物資，不願從事生產，所以物價愈高，生產反而減縮了。所以我感慨的說，現在全上海的每一個人雖然都在期望着低物價，但另一方面，有意無意，直接間接的却都在製造高物價，或助長物價的高漲　　講到這裹，我實在不願再說，也不能再說，總而言之，本市的物價問題，是全面的物價問題的一環，必須全面籌劃，未可局部醫治所能奏效，當然我決不推卸這個局部的責任，因此就讓我來單講我們上海局部經濟機構所管物理的局部價問題。（以下轉入第二版）</p>

<h3>深望中國協力物資共同完遂戰爭</h3>
<p>日竹內次官披瀝來華觀感　　盟邦日本大東亞省竹內次官，此次來華觀光，於昨（十四）日由京抵滬，特於昨下午五時在南京路外灘華懋飯店九樓，會見本市中國新聞記者，竹內次官由大使館上海事務所松平情報部長準時陪同蒞會，即席由記者團方面提出問題五則，承次官答覆甚詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<h3>物資恊助</h3>
<p>一大東亞戰爭日趨激烈化，請問次官日本方面對中國之希望如何？（答）大東亞戰爭已趨激烈化，而日本國內戰時之體制益趨堅固，查日本政府之施行政策，完全針對適應現在戰局，故施行之政策中堅化，換言之，日本之經濟政策方面，全力注重產業擴充，及勞務動員，故引項體制準備巳展開實行，國民戰意更爲昂揚，而本人對中國所希望者如下：值此中日兩國共同完遂大東亞戰爭之際，日軍在中國大陸及南方太平洋廣大地區進行戰爭，爲了進行此項作戰，需用頗多資源，大東亞戰爭爲東亞解放之戰，東亞諸民族應積極集中全力，爲此戰爭而努力。至於中國方面，日軍在前綫奮勇作戰，所需物資，深望中國分担此項責任，不但中國負此責任，而南洋諸盟邦，亦當分負此責，中國爲大東亞之一員，在華北方面之煤炭和鐵，及華中方面之糧食，與其他物資，至望協力。</p>
<h3>來華感想</h3>
<p>二請問次官來華視察之任務及感想如何？（答）本人此次來華，并無特殊任務，自赴滿洲參加典禮後，順道來華觀光，從北平南京而至上海，視察各地戰時上種種情形，在華北中所得感想如下：本人目睹各地情形，均熱烈合作，殊爲良好現象，深爲愉快，同時得悉華產紋面產麥收穫豐順，而米糧亦收穫頗佳，查糧食乃安定民生之基本問題，本人獲悉中國糧食良好現象，愉快非常，在華中方面同樣如此，至爲樂觀。同時本人道經華北華中城市，頗抒感想，各該街道之清潔，充滿朝氣，是乃象徵中國經濟繁榮之表現，本人衷心愉快非常。</p>

<h3>主席致詞</h3>
<p>主席船津辰一郎致開會詞，略謂：[敵英美兩國，巳開始拼死力向日本企圖進攻，而中國自去年一月九日參加大東亞戰爭後，同時南洋菲律賓，亦於上月卅日向敵宣戰，此外緬印亦先後獨立而相繼參戰，惟央美對於東亞之野心，仍未消滅，一貫侵爲其殖民地。如東亞諸國一旦爲敵所侵，今後將永遠淪爲殖民地，現在唯一爭取最後勝利，我人如何應付敵英美之侵略，只有大家同心協力，同舟共濟，因此本會之立塲，亦即以此爲出發點，希望在座諸君，應克服艱困，排除萬難，盡最大之力量，以期達到目的。過去本會對上海燃料民食等問題，協力當局，今夏會舉行座談會多次，將討論結果，貢獻於中日諸位之協力，鼓吹推進，本人深表謝意，同時並深望今後一貫旣定目標邁進，以一份子的力量，貢獻於中日兩國，則前途裨益非淺。]</p>
<h3>聞蘭亭詞</h3>
<p>本屆新理事長聞蘭亭致詞，略謂：[今天本會舉行二周紀念會，同時舉行五屆會員大會，回想兩年前本會創立之始，以工商聯誼會命名，原期中日工商界人士藉以溝通情感，爲民間合作之先聲。兩年以來，本會中日會員之間，盡量向這個目標前進，可是實際上，現在中日兩國已經是甘苦相共的同盟關係了，已經超過了聯誼的範圍，所以我們今後應進一步，從事實踐同盟的工作。現在中國兩國，是同盟作戰，我們應當如何合作，共同貢獻最大的力量。我們工商界當然應在戰時經濟方面努力，譬如增加生產，抑平物價，協助統制經濟，發展國民經濟等等問題，都是很需要中日工商界共同努力的。可是無論任何戰時經濟問題，獲得措施上的成效，最重要的諒是顧到國情民情，與各地環境，則可事倍功半。最後我敢不自插的說：上海經濟問題的合理解決，有賴於我們共同努力的非常殷切，同時更可以說：我們的努力適當與否，不但上海地方有極大影響，就是全國民生以至於大東亞戰爭中也有極重要的地位，所以我很希望會員諸君，尤其是盟邦方面的會員諸君，特別顧到中國國情與民表，以及各地環境的重要性，共同努力於戰時經濟問題的處理與解決。]</p>

<h3>物價評議會</h3>
<p>本人就任之前，經濟局內已有一個物價評議會的設立，但因租界尚未收回，評價範圍限於市區，所以組織簡單，並格於環境，事實上也難於推進，本人就任之後，奉市長命改組物價評議會。本人深知識責艱鉅，非加強組織，不足以完成這種使命，會擬就一個計劃，並請市長担任該會委員長，本人擬自任秘書長，後因市長公務忙碌，不克兼顧，乃交由本人誜任主委，各委員均係各有關機關長宮兼任，最後又承中央意旨加強組織，增聘委員，所以現任各委員，是下列各有關機關長官：一，市政府，二實業部，三，經濟局，四，警察局，五，衛生局，六，配給處，七，商統會，及其附屬各會：一米統會，二棉統會，三日用品統制會，四粉麥統制會，五油糧統制會，八，中央儲備銀行，九，輿論界。　　過去本市物價管理，沿用原舊工部局物資統制局及舊一區經濟處辦法，後來遵照實實部規定，分公定與協定價格二種，公定的係指最主要商品價格，二個月前已經評定公佈了，協定的係指次要商品價格，由各公會自行協定後，呈經本局備案。關於公定價格的商品品止，根據實業部規定的，有下列各類：一，食糧類—食米，麵粉；二，調味類—食鹽，食油；三，燃料類—煤塊，煤球；四，雜用類—肥皂，火柴，洋燭，紙張，西藥；五，服用類—棉　花，棉紗，棉布；六，畜產類—牛肉，猪肉。</p>
<h3>生活必需品</h3>
<p>照此品目來說，評價人可以評價的，只有紙張及西藥二種，其他都另有機關統制的，其價格不歸我們評價會評定的，復由評價會會同各工商家及經濟專家詳密研安，認定下列一百餘種爲生活必需品，必須公定，呈請實業部核准。這一百餘種的品目如下：　　一食糧類——米及米製品：食米，苞米，麥粞，粢飯。麵粉及麵粉製品：麵粉，切麵，麵包，大餅，油條，餅乾。　　二附其他食品——豆及豆製品：黃豆，赤豆，乾蠶豆，發芽豆，黃豆芽，豆腐，豆腐乾，油豆腐，百頁，乳腐。鮮豆：蠶豆莢，豇豆莢，扁豆莢。瓜：黃瓜，東瓜，茄子。　　三蔬菜類——大白菜，小白菜，小上菜，菜結，雞毛菜，捲心菜，菠菜，搭課菜，韮菜，鹹白菜，鹹雪菜，洋山芋，甜薯，白蘿葡。南貨：金針，木耳，扁尖，綫粉乾。魚：鮮黃魚，鮮帶魚，鹹黃魚，鹹帶魚。蛋：鴨蛋，鷄蛋。　　四調味類——醬油，粗鹽，食糖，食油。　　五燃料類——煤球，樹柴，煤，廢木材。　　六雜用類——肥皂，火柴，洋燭，紙烟，草紙，表蕊紙，牙粉，牙刷，開水，習字簿，小楷簿，練習簿，毛筆，鉛筆，白報紙，有光紙，毛邊紙。　　七服用類——棉布，棉花，內衣，襪，毛巾，鞋，木紗。　　八畜產類——肉：鮮猪肉，鮮牛肉。附水產品：螺螄。</p>
<h3>管理注意點</h3>
<p>關於管理物價，本局歷來注重下列五點：一農產品與工業品之價格，在交換關係上，應維持均衡；二生產與消費者價格經濟的利害關係應調和；三獎勵生產，節約消費，並實行生產計劃化；四人民生活必需品及軍需品，應堅持低物價原則；五以政治力量導引於大東亞戰爭的後方經濟建設。　　今後的評價工作，應行改進之點尚多，譬如評價標準，自應根據成本會計，所以構成成本的生產費，應加以分別，特別注意，以求達到輕減的原則。本局對於一般生產費，現已劃分爲下列八項：　　一原料，二工資，三電力（即原動力），四運輸，五利息，六生產設備消耗費，七捐稅，八營業費。　　本局爲應付目前嚴重局面，將加緊取締投機囤積等步驟。關於統制品價格，正分別與統制主管機關磋商，並召集各同業公會，商討[自治統制]辦法外，又嚴令各同業公會轉飭各會員商號，對於賣賣貨品，限令一律標明價格，不得擅自抬價，並將本局評定之價格，印製成冊，以爲取締非法抬價的標準。同時本局廣採民意起見，又鼓勵人民告密，並在局內特設小組會議，集合專家，經常研究對策。又與經濟保安處合組聯絡會議，以便統一進行。</p>
<h3>向中央建議</h3>
<p>復建議中央，請對於下列各事項，急急設法改進，以期收本標兼施之效：　　一保障生產者的原料供給；二保障生產者的電力供給；三改進交進，便利貨物流通；四改善配給制度，務期種類增加，數量適足；五經濟統制機關，應防止其商業化；六公用事業之售價及規費，政府應請設法補助，不得一再加價，以免刺激一般物價；七迅即組設全國物價統制的中央機構。　　關於增加生產，農業方面，依照中央頒佈農業增產計劃，本局已添設科，切實推進，工業方面，本局已聯絡大使館舉辦工廠用電登記，以爲增加工廠用電之準備。　　這是我們對於物價管理方面努力的大槪情形。但仍須聯絡有關各方面如大使館，領事館，憲兵隊，經濟保安處，各統制機關，各業同業公會，及新聞界，共同努力。工作誠然困難，制度誠然不完善，但我們職責所在，有一分力量，就要盡一分力量，以鞠躬盡瘁而後已。尚望諸位不時予指教及協助，使我們的工作能夠日益接近穩定物價的目標，這是本人所竭誠期待的。</p>

<p>各國代表的期望</p>
<p>第三屆大東亞文學者大會，第一次決定在中國南京召集。正當熾烈的戰火燒近國土時，而召開這樣文化性的國際代表大會，可以說是歷史上空前的壯舉。仇敵英美的國際會議，是卑鄙齷齪的分贓會議，而彼此相較，才知道大東亞戰爭是毫無侵略他人領土的眞正意義，同時也證明我們的必勝信念是如何牢固。每日新聞社特別提出大東亞文學獎金來，不惜全面恊助該會，用意也就在此，所以對於新生中國的首都南京即將舉行的東方文化會議，而將收集大東亞各國的作家代表之決心，出一專刋。</p>
<h3>日本橫光利一</h3>
<p>戰爭愈演愈烈，因而作家的國際團結，也愈感必要，這是每一個希望大東亞戰爭勝利的人所想到的。對於東亞文學者大會，最初會是政治上的要求，漸成爲知識上的祈求，更進而變爲預定的文化調和。把一種鞏固的自然意志構成爲形體，這還是明治大帝以來，第一次發生的現象。　　這在文化方面來看，就是表面上的觀察。如忽略這種意義，就是不智慧。各自都放大眼光，在決戰期間召開文化祭典，實在也不是每一個國家都能作到的事。　　非急需事體是應當放在後面作的，然而此時擺在前面的這一不急需事體，就是可以說，想把平時願望密切地和決戰願望聯接起來的一種實際一現。　　戰爭的本身，在東洋來說，無論什麼時候都是調和的戰爭。戰爭愈激烈，而調和速度也就愈加提高，但各處所表現的是衝突的調和。這就是東方的調和性格，是自然的要求，同時也是不加任何粉飾的地方。　　東亞的事情，應當由東亞來解決，這是無待說明而才明白的。這樣明顯的事情變成不明顯的原因，我並不想在此鑽研，但需要知道者，就是大家都知道的上次大會所綜合起來的大東亞優良意志，祈願，思想，追求，憧憬等成果；而希望於此次南京大會者，即過去者不必再去算舊賬，但我們對於敵國要認識清楚，是我們的共同敵人。這樣一望即知的原因，我們要向全體東亞諄諄解釋其不明白的原因，同時更要使一般人知道，甚至敵國也不能不贊頌東方的美德。　　現在已經不需要解說戰爭之爲物了。是行動的時期了。這固然是已經成了一般人的口頭禪，但對於敵國的企圖要百尺竿頭更進一步地來理解，在這樣空前驚人的戰爭當中，觀念也唯其爲觀念，所以就是最緊急迫切的經濟行動。　　正因爲如此，像金錢和物資一樣，不亞於目能見的經濟那樣重要的文化方面，可能把此次戰爭的正確意義，傳達出來，對於未來加以暗示，對於過去加以整理，對於東亞的人類付以歷史性意義，這就是文化方面的新課題。南京大會的重要性，也就在於這一點。各種的過失，就是成功之母。</p>
<h3>中國龔持平</h3>
<p>第三屆大東亞文學者大會定於國父誕辰十一月十二日，在南京召開中日滿文學者三十數人的大會。召集大東亞文學者大會的止的與意義，正如大東亞共同宣言所指示，大東亞各國相互尊重傳說，發展各個民族的創造性，藉此以闡明大東亞的文化。　　近百年來以英美功利思想爲基礎的四洋文化，藉軍事及經濟的掩護，而入寇東亞，會給東方文化以莫大創傷與毒害。　　於是對於具有五千年悠久文化歷史的中國，造成政治腐敗，軍閥混戰，社會紊亂的現象。目的在建立日本領導的大東亞共榮圈，和打破英美侵略解放東亞民族的此次大東亞戰爭，就是描準英美的侵略文化與以致命打擊，同時也是復興東方文化和發展各個民族的本然文化的。然而想到今年是最緊急的生死關頭時，文學者也應當與軍事當局一樣，共同從事爭取勝利。　　換言之，大東亞戰爭業已達到決戰階段的今天，對於改造新東亞，發揮東方文化，建設新世界文化，則應當東亞各國相互尊重傳統，發揮各民族的創造性，動員所有大東亞各國文化人，以完成我們共同的最高理想。　　前兩屆大會全是在東京召集的，而此屆大會却在中國召集，當然要有其特殊意義的。（南京發）</p>
<h3>菲國伊加西亞諾</h3>
<p>大會在南京召集，我們是同樣歡迎的，因爲在新秩序的基礎上，強力的文化機構中，決定展開大東亞文學的特異性之原故。由於大會在目前艱苦的決戰階段下召集，交通阻賽關係，所以全部大東亞共榮圈各國的代表不能赴會，只好單純由日本，滿洲國，中華民國派遣代表。然而我們菲律賓共和國，如可能，則縱令一個代表也要派去赴會的，只要有機會與各國代表會談的機會，我認爲總是無上光榮的。　　在目前這一重大時代，我們文學家所必須認清時，就是在此次大戰中我們必須取得勝利，只有勝利後，大東亞十億人民才能完全從鐵蹄下解放下來，東亞的文學精神才能取得自由，而充分發揮創造性文學的必要氛圍氣才才釀成。　　菲律賓作家所望於大會者有三點：　　第一，一九四二年會決定派代表赴東京的第一屆大東亞文學者會議，但非常可惜未能演說。所以此次南京召集的第三屆會議，無論我們怎能貧乏，也想要有一點供獻，同時更希望與各國代表間加深友誼。　　第二，第一屆大會是菲律賓倘未取得獨立時召集的，而現在菲律賓也是獨立國之一，所以今日的菲律賓文學者想要站在同等獨立國的基礎上，與大東亞代表暢談一切的。去年在東京召集的大東亞文學者大會，我們共和國會派鮑吉斯塔和筆者二人赴會。文學者也是在這一大的動蕩時代中生存着的一個有機體，所以很想與各國常常接角以取得　感。　　第三，在所有共榮圈的國家當中，大家應當瞭解者，即菲律賓會經過四百年之久受西歐異族的支配宰割，而處於特殊狀態中。所以希望共他友邦要同情我們，帮助我們成爲眞實的東亞國家。如是則進而會給與整個共榮圈以繁榮影響。最後我不能已於言者，即我們的戰局處在這樣吃緊的階段，而日本仍然關心於大東亞共榮圈的文化向上，這實在令人感激莫名的。對於準備大東亞勝利後承平時代的蓬勃文化之花，這是令人感謝不置的（馬尼拉發）</p>
<h3>泰國紐亞</h3>
<p>正當戰爭愈演愈烈的期間，東亞共榮圈各國召集盛大的大東亞文學者大會，這實在是嚝古未有的奇蹟，也實在是令人歡欣的。東亞共榮圈各國利用這一大會，相互實行文化充分的交流，正確指導戰鬥中的共榮圈各國人民，進而希望大東亞戰爭勝利，藉得建立大東亞文化。老實說，泰國多半會受到法國文學的影響，拉麻二世的時代，會是翻譯法國文學的時代。拉麻四世時，一時會盛行英國文學，尤其歡迎莎士比亞，但後來又被法國文學影響新支配。　　然而一九三八年畢本政權建立起來後，與當時天室圖書局總裁萬維殿下，畢特氏等共同恢復泰國的國粹文學，而迄於今。　　泰國會產生過順登，堡（名著有[金山]）這樣空前絕對的詩人，但眞不幸，一直到今天尚無機會把泰國文學介紹給東亞共榮圈各國，今年秋天在南京召開的大東亞文學者大會，追隨共榮圈各國文化的興隆，而要完成這一介紹，這實在是意義無窮的。（盤谷發）　　—安譯自九月十六日　　每日新聞—</p>
<h3>大東亞文學賞—各地銓衡中—</h3>
<p>死戰決鬥的聲浪中，在南京召開大東亞文學建設的共榮圈文學者大會，決定在大會最後一天頒發光榮的第二屆大東亞文學賞。第一屆大東亞文學賞，是去年東京大會時決定，而在日滿華三地舉行頒發典禮的，但可惜者，南洋一帶因無優秀作品出現，未會取得第一屆的光榮機會。所以這一年間，南洋一帶的熱忱以及新秩序理念的吸收，已經有了突飛猛進的成果。菲律賓·爪哇·馬萊·泰國·緬甸等國，八月以來業已召開過銓衡委員會，而努力選擇候補作品。　　在爪哇日前會有當地文壇上的一流作家馬諾斯·姆爾夫著的[時代英雄]詩歌，和亞奧·加爾達哈帝馬家著的[不是爲我]小說等交來審查。在泰國，目前以泰國文化院爲中心，正在收集和審查作品，因爲獲得大東亞文學賞，這對於泰國也有無上光榮，所以文化院的審查和銓衡非常愼重而認眞。在日本，則有鍵田研一著的[滿洲建國]等十數篇，業已在銓衡委員手中討論着。滿洲國方面，古丁作的[新生]據說最有希望。在中國，草野心平担任銓衡領導，每天在煞費苦心地選擇中。　　那一種作品，以及那一位作家獲得這樣光榮的大東亞文學賞，當然要引起共榮圈的人民注意，同時協約國方面，尤其重慶和印度等敵區，也會成爲視綫的焦點。所以我們抱着絕大期望，要選出搖撼我們共榮圈民族靈魂的偉大傑作來。　　此外日滿華以及南洋四地的銓衡委員會，近一個月內將完成任務，而立刻交與東京的總審查委員會，以求最後的決定，同時在開會前準備向全樂亞人民發表。日本方面第二屆大東亞文學賞銓衡委員有：　　淺野晃，阿部知二，伊藤整，石川達三，岡田三郎，大佛次郎，趨并勝一郎，河上徹太郎，川端康成，富沢有爲男，戶川貞雄，丹羽文雄，芳賀檯，保田與重郎，橫光利一等十五名。　　四地區作品的綜合最後決定審查委員有：　　尾崎士郎，菊池寬，久米正雄，佐藤春夫，齊藤洌，白井喬二，高村光太郎，豐島與志雄，長與善郎，中村武羅夫，正宗白島，武者小路實篤，山本有三，吉川英治等十四名，此外日本政府情報局文藝課長井上司朗，以及本社（每日新聞）文化部長黑崎貞治郎兩名也參加在內。（安譯自九月十六日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>友愛永徘徊</h3>
<p>— 陳鏡如</p>
<p>在回憶中的童年生活除了充滿着天眞頑皮之外，似乎很奇怪地在當時會對一位小姑娘發生好感，而且我一直到現在還深深地懷念着她，她是我的同鄉又是同學，說起來應該是七八年以前的事情了。　　中　心學校在Ｎ鎭是一所有名的小學校，在這裹面，我很順利地受完了正統的基本教程，記得我正在進入五年級上學期的時候，在同班中，我就發現了有她的影子，圓潤的臉兒，一付逼人愛的笑容，靈巧的身材，文雅的舉動，我就覺到她是一個非常可愛的人物。也許這是一個少女特有的矜持，她不大喜歡與人談話，因此她的表面沒有像南國姑娘樣奔放的熱情，而時時在莊嚴冷靜中流露出無限的純潔眞誠，天資聰明，對各種功課都很好，尤其國文及綴法一項，在校友會主辦的壁報上時常有她的大作發表，又寫得一手好字，會博得全校師長同學們的讚許，學期結束，她的學業成績在全級中，不是第一便是第二。　　不知是誰的使遣，在高小四個學期裹，在同班中，我與她都是同桌而坐，因爲比較多親近的緣故，彼此間建立了異於普通的友誼關係，晨曦中，夕照裹，我們平望踏着同一步伐上學或散學，星期休假日，我們亦經常地徘徊在花園中，公路上，田野間，隨便的談論着學業上的各項問題，在這種坦白無邪的友誼之中，使我們的學問知識在默默中相互地進展着。　　小　學畢業後，有一個搖長的暑假把我們相隔着，每當夏夜納涼的時候，我會自然而然地想起她，圓的臉，美的笑容，……一陣莫能自釋的喜悅掠過心頭，對於她的人品，她的學業，正像仰望黑空中的繁星一樣，給於我的是一種崇高與光亮的感覺。　　不久，我們又在Ｓ中學的商科一年級教室中相遇，覺得她比以前更趨於少女應有的美與可愛之外，她還是一貫在小學時的沉默寡言，好學不倦的精神，業餘課後，別的同學們，吵的吵，鬧的鬧，回家的回家，但是她總是埋首於圖書館中的書堆裹，或靜讀於校園後的小溪邊。有時我與她會不約而同地出現於同一地點，廣塲上的樹蔭下，清流旁的石階前，而她除了熟悉地招呼了一聲之後，她便低下頭靜靜地，默默地看着書本，也許年齡比較大了一點，她不再像以前一樣的男女不避嫌疑了。但是當我偶而不經意地望着她背影的時候，她却會偷偷地轉過頭來注意着我，被我看穿了，她就無言中嫵媚地一笑。有一次校中開一個學生作業展覽會，把各級同學優秀的各項課卷簿子等分別的陳列起來，而我發現她有一大半的時間在詳細地翻閱我的[生活週記]簿，當我走上前去的時候，她又慌忙地裝着看別人的簿子，爲了什麼，我至今還想不透，一顆少女的心。　　孜　孜不倦的努力，使她在各方面的成績平均地超乎一般同學們的水準綫之上，她的名字照例地被全校的師生們誇讚着。放暑假前，校中舉行一次全校同學聚歡會，她受到校長最光榮的特等獎狀，在一片熱烈的掌聲之中，她蘋果也似的臉兒顯得更紅更美了。這美麗的光彩象徵出她的前程照耀着一片無比的光亮。　　接着，炎暑挾着戰神來臨，全鎭陷入了焦色的恐怖之中，我們就在瓦礫堆中分別，一別，就是七八年，遙長的歲月呵，如今天涯海角，不知她生活在何方？　　揭　開了青春的序幕，我感到自己是一個沙漠地上孤獨的旅行者，但當圓潤的臉，美的筆容，這個熟悉的印象，在心底浮現時，就不再感到孤獨，我似乎感到有相同的步伐聲在前面響着，我怎不緊跟着前進呢？　　她是誰？姓什麼，名什麼，恕我不再說明，反正有這樣的一位同學，讓我永遠銘記在心頭。</p>
<h3>做父親的悲歌</h3>
<p>— 徐嘉鈴</p>
<p>我是一個有十個孩子的父親，也怪我自己不好，這年頭還養了這麼大一羣小猢猻，猢猻還能玩把戲，賺錢，可是我的一羣，却只是要吃，要穿，要唸書，賺不了一個大子。　　我當然不能怪他們不會賺錢，因爲我還沒有替他們下足本錢。我恨不得一個一個地把他們頓時拉長，這樣可以省了不少米糧，也縮短了那折磨人的光陰；至少也想把他們一個一個吹胖，免得個個黃皮裹骨，看了也傷心。　　阿大在大學唸書，阿二，阿三在高中，阿四在初中，阿五，阿六，阿七在小學，阿八留在家裹，阿九剛會走路，阿十還在吃奶。也算兒子女兒掙氣，阿大拿了獎學金，阿二，阿三貸學金，阿四在校中完全免費，阿五阿六阿七又都是減費生，着實減輕了我做父親的負擔，可是一學期的用品費，可也不少啊！人家總說我福氣好，有這麼大的一羣兒女，並且個個都是有志氣，肯唸書的人。我當然也很高興，但是生活的陰影，馬上會把我的高興趕跑哩　　有時候，我會突然地發出怪想：[爲什麼我的兒女這樣要唸書呢？他們要是能不高興吟書該多好？阿大可以進銀行，阿二去做護士，阿三做練習生，阿四阿五去當學徒，……唉！該可以帮我多少忙啊！至少也能自顧自，可是他們却偏愛好書本。……唉……。]當然，我知道我這個念頭，是完全錯誤的，但是，我還是常常會想到它。　　每月最少要吃一石米，燒一担煤球，還有油啦，菜啦，房租啦，……眞是弄得頭昏眼花，可是我只賺儲備票六千元，雖然戒絕了烟酒，還是一個[不夠]！至於怎麼樣渡過日子，我有點糢糊，好像是受氣，悶睡，上典當，跟妻子吵架，打小孩子，……。　　其實黃臉婆也的確夠苦啦。娘家本來很好，從小又是一個享福人，現在跟了我這窮鬼，着實受了人家許多氣。家裹沒有傭人，從朝到晚，燒飯，洗菜，洗衣服，全是她一手料理，空下來還得教阿八識字，當心阿九摔跤，給阿十哺乳，……。有時候還得上親戚家去挪偕，幫着想法子過活。我也明瞭她的賢慧，勤勞，但是不知怎的，還常常會跟她拌嘴，弄得大家流眼淚。　　早晨，爲了節省煤球，就買點心吃。阿七捧了一付大餅油條進來，一面走，一面啃着。我就對妻說：[瞧，爲什麼又給他吃一副大餅油條呢？吃壞了怎麼辦！下次給他一個大餅，也就夠啦。]孩子似乎有點窘，只是不敢哭出來。妻也默默無聲地整理着床舖。其實，我也知道，一副大餅油條，對於一個九歲的小孩，是絕對吃不壞的，何況今天中午又得吃稀粥呢！我愛孩子，希望他們長得白白胖胖，過着小王子一般的生活，但是，不知怎的，我竟吝嗇起一根油條來。　　每當物價有跳蕩的時候，妻總是嘆着氣說，這樣東西該快買啦，那樣也該快買啦。我常常想把口袋裹的錢拿出來，呌她去買。但是一計算日子，離發薪還得半個月，我也不得不嘆了口氣回答她：[算了，窮人總是吃貴貨]　　當然，我也有高興的時候，譬如說，阿大得了最優獎。阿二阿三得了第一名，阿四成績在九十五分以上，……阿九能夠爲我拿拖鞋，掛帽子，阿十能夠呌爸爸。這時候，我又不得不慶幸着自己有這麼一羣好兒女，幻想着未來的世界，我的眼睛中不覺擠　出了幾滴熱水。　　但是現實的生活問題又逼現在眼前，這幻想的未來世界又不知道何時才能來臨。　　我唯一的安慰就是這幻想的未來世界，否則，我早不想生存了。</p>

<h3>觀吳中行攝影展</h3>
<p>— 家西</p>
<p>近年來在上海書畫展覽的風氣很是盛行，就是攝影展覽也有過好多次，而現在正在舉行中的吳中行先生攝影義展，要算是最最令人滿意的一次了。　　吳先生是完全以業餘時間從事攝影工作，並且巳繼續不斷和精益求精地研習了二十多年，所以他的成就和造詣是很可貴的。吳先生在國際方面很負盛名，曾數度入選國際展覽。但是吳先生的作品在本國反而不大爲人所熟知，這是由於他埋頭工作不尚自我宣傳的結果。此次應本報之請始爲助學而義展，這也正是吳先生的攝影作品第一次公開與觀衆相見呢！　　在這次陳列的作品中有著參加過國外展覽會的傑作，同時更有最近完成尚未發表過的佳構。雖然是僅僅一百多幅，然而卻都是代表之作，巳經給人以美不勝收之感。如[雙清]一幅在國外覽展也會屢獲有好評，在攝影的技術裹完全表現出東方圖書的色彩美，[武陵春暖]色彩的鮮明光綫也給人難忘的印象，[溪橋積雪][雪竹][漁汀積雪]等幅令人有置身於嚴冬之感，[玩物]一幅利用強烈光綫的對照是很富於技巧的，[溪橋塔影][碧潤流泉]等幅都加以變化繁多的色彩　更強調了圖面的表現性和寫實性，那著色的均勻和妥貼，又說明了作者又是一個著色的能手，由[秋光喜到竹籬邊][凍雀]等幅中，又可知道作者是一個喜於取材的大家，以上都是作者的特長，是很值得注意　和鄭重介紹的。　　在會塲中川流不息地擠滿了好幾百爲欣賞攝影而來的觀衆，他們集中注意力的凝視着圖面，這裹不僅僅有着中國人，日德蘇等各國的僑民也不少，在這兩天各外國文的報紙上，也登着許多介紹和批評的文字，這固然是因爲藝術是沒有國界的所致，然而作者作品的富於強大的吸引力和無可否認號召力，也是不可抹殺的。</p>

<h3>觀兩次福利足球賽後本屆四強實力檢討</h3>
<p>— 必賢</p>
<p>本屆足球聯賽，已於上週末展開，甲組僅有一塲角逐，爲聯誼戰俄體，實力懸殊，不足論矣。惟福利足球賽已有二塲，所對抗者爲中西四大巨頭，東華聯誼僑聯葡商，在季初隊有此好戲登塲，球迷莫不雀躍。筆者觀兩次之後，頗覺聯賽甲組將不脫爲此四強之天下。故對兩塲福利賽簡情略叙，再對此四強加以評述焉。</p>
<h3>第一次不歡而散</h3>
<p>第一次福利賽於上週由東華迎僑聯。上屆僑聯會受六敗之辱，故該隊極擬在此賽中一吐積仇。故開戰之後，祗見胡兒縱橫，東華健兒措手之間，僅知固守而已。然究以經騐球藝，並不遜人，故竟仍能以二對○佔先。不意正以爲且利穩收，而番將後勁充足，頃刻間連獲三球，後來居上。尚餘十餘分鐘時，僑聯以不服裁判之判而離塲，造成不歡而散，不免爲美中不足，稍有遺憾耳。茲根據此戰，對兩隊有所評述。</p>
<h3>東華</h3>
<p>上屆之鋒芒開球史之新紀錄，百戰百勝，從未有敗績，難能可貴，本屆全部人馬照舊。有云：凡事不進則退，如逆水行舟，東華在此戰中，顯然並無進境之點，抑且有數將反見退步，此固季初必然之現象，不足苛責。惟查本屆各強隊均有雄圖，招兵買馬。故筆者亟盼東華加勤練習，球藝之不斷進境，則當不難再蟬聯上屆之一番雄姿也。</p>
<h3>僑聯</h3>
<p>其個人技術之精湛與夫長力之充沛，早爲一般球迷所公認。其缺乏者爲不能用智及聯絡次佳耳。如能改進此二點，登峯造極，豈可限量，本屆初次露面，頗覺其對於用智方面，似尚有不夠。而地於隊的答作一層，已經知所注意。演出已不若以前之徒恃大刀闊斧，略有小動作及細膩之傳遞矣。如再能加以精求戰術上之改進，則本屆之僑聯，勢將刮目相視。</p>
<h3>第二次聯誼出色</h3>
<p>第二次福利賽，於本週三，亦在跑馬廳舉行，聯誼葡商出馬。聯誼有二小將羅壽福高秀清之加入，前綫一洗過去萎頓狀態。益以其餘老人馬在暑間勤練不輟，體力已見充沛，表演乃出色。葡商對於陣容支配，亦竭盡攻守兼顧之能事。故雙方過程，緊湊異常。聯誼終賴合力同心，發揮至上威力，小將高秀清尤爲卯上，獨中兩球，乃以四對二壓倒人材濟濟之葡商，實屬非易。二隊均有顯著之煥新成績</p>
<h3>聯誼</h3>
<p>其隊員之各個技術，本超乎各隊之上．上屆中途，悄然引退，別有苦衷，遂使愛好該隊球藝之球迷，望洋興嘆。唯該隊上屆隊員之精神煥散，亦爲不可磨滅之事實。本屆該隊處心積慮，必須恢復令譽，除新邀新將外，其舊隊員亦力求圖上。故全隊隊員，早已恢復原狀，且兩新將之確能有爲，故其演出，自有其可取之點。其殺辣之作風，固與東華之細膩姿態，另有一種令人欣賞之可愛處。深望以此前進，本屆大有厚望焉，勉之，聯誼健兒！</p>
<h3>葡商</h3>
<p>本屆陣容支配，殊多周密，老將考司坦鮑休脫等聯袂出山，無異以前威赫一時之法商變相。前戰雖以二對四敗於聯誼，實爲[季初病]之現象。依其人材之整齊，經騐之老到，戰術之狡猾，必有越戰越人佳境之作，將來在聯賽中雖未必能榮膺冠軍，其將爲我東聯兩強之心腹患必然。　　總上以論，足聯賽中甲組中最有奪標可能者，厥唯上述四隊，其次則以尚未露臉之滬警，或有意外之成績。今日滬警初戰華通，自可鑒及究屬若何，唯無論如何，終不逮上術四強耳。</p>
<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽甲組各隊涇渭已見</h3>
<p>— 潔梅</p>
<p>申報盃籃球開賽以來，雖僅一週餘，因強弱之分，涇渭已見，上週筆者會介紹甲組十隊實力，現已證實。目下保持不敗者，爲華聯中北大華汕隊華南，而已有敗績者爲明星華影Ｖ隊仁餘同仁。各得其半，界限殊清，雖不能即以此爲定論，然大致之次序，決無多大之變化矣。　　觀一週來各隊之情形，頗覺有希望各隊，俱在鈎心門角，如華聯隊之羅致西人名將勃脫及即將來滬之北國名手傳金聲助陣。雄心所至，不可言喻。而中北隊旣有趙稚林李寶中等均留滬，復得國手尹煥文加入。於是北國之雄，溶於一爐，來日該兩強之血戰，必可爲數年來罕有盛況。目下球迷早以華，中，大戰爲談話資料矣。其次當以大華隊亦有染指之野心，老將陣祥龍許文奎陸鍾恩之遽然下塲，其理已明，日後必爲華聯中北之勁敵。至汕隊諸小將球藝之竿頭日重，有目共覩。將來之是否能有超然收穫，須觀其臨陣之經騐適應而定，似難預論其如何程度·其餘各隊，則精神均佳，名位之爭，必各出奇兵制勝，求技藝之表演，博球迷之欣賞，爲本籃球盃賽增添光樂之一段。　　又下週內各塲中，當以週五大華對汕門之役，爲最引人注目之一幕，兩隊情況，俱進展中。雖非爲決奪之爭，其與各位之出入，固甚重要也。故此賽允爲申報盃開賽後最夠刺激之一幕矣。</p>
<h3>什錦</h3>
<p>緣隊女子排球隊台柱黃杏芬小姐，在排球壇上領譽已垂十餘載。老將風度，毌讓後起。現黃小姐定於本月二十一日與實業界巨子楊逸澄君結婚，預料結婚之後，將難見黃小姐球塲上之風姿矣。　　東華足球隊守門張邦倫，亦擅籃球，在申報盃中爲大華隊効勞，演出殊佳，每賽其夫人必隨來捧塲，所以壯氣。張夫人溫文靜淑，對球事亦有研究，時對張君有所指摘，誠志同道合之好伴侶也。　　賈幼良尊翁上月千古後，定今日假貝勒路莊嚴寺設奠，幼良昆仲，交遊廣闊，預料必有一番哀榮。（靜端）</p>
<h3>愛好運動之[楊家將]</h3>
<p>大華男女兩籃球隊爲滬上赫赫有名之球隊。球員技術精良，態度謙和。其領隊爲楊叔鼎氏主持一切，成績斐然。每逢本隊出塲比賽，不論甲乙組，均親自到塲指導。凡遇其他運動比賽每往參觀，興趣濃厚。查楊氏年近花甲，而精神鑠矍，爲金融家巨子。偕夫人子女參觀運動比賽，其樂融融。子元愷，爲前進之寶業家。元龍現任約翰大學教授，爲大華球隊名將。其女亦喜玩球，寓所備有球塲。全家均好運動，人喜稱之謂[現代楊家將]。（駌）</p>

        <h1>1944.10.15</h1>
<h3>Travelogue</h3>
<p>— Chun Zai</p>
<p>This time, I got a chance to travel. Starting from Guangzhou Bay, a village market in the corner of the South Sea, I took a plane, passing through Hainan Island, Guangdong, Taipei City, and Shanghai. On the day I arrived in Shanghai, the first friend I met was Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao. After the usual greetings, he asked me to write an article for Shen Bao. Because of our old friendship, I couldn't refuse, so I wrote this [Travelogue]. People in Shanghai may not know what kind of place Guangzhou Bay is, because Guangzhou Bay is too small compared to Shanghai. It only accommodates more than 60,000 people, roughly speaking, it is only one-ninetieth of Shanghai. That's why I call it a village market. People in village markets everywhere easily know about Shanghai, but people in Shanghai don't easily know about village markets everywhere. This is a natural phenomenon. First of all, I want to tell Shanghai people about one thing in Guangzhou Bay, that is, the price of rice in Guangzhou Bay has remained between 2,000 and 2,600 yuan per stone for the past two years, without a sharp rise. What's the reason? The rice produced in the Leizhou Peninsula can be freely transported into Guangzhou Bay City. The Chinese and Japanese authorities there adopt a welcoming and facilitating attitude towards rice entering the market. Secondly, important merchants in Guangzhou Bay, such as Chen Xuetan and Lai Ze, do not want to make money from the rice business. They are in a position to purchase and sell flat-priced rice in large quantities on behalf of the citizens. Therefore, the citizens of Guangzhou Bay always eat rice at a not very high price. I passed through Hainan Island in a hurry, and there is nothing to say. I stayed in Guangzhou for two weeks. What I saw was that the spirit of the Guangdong people was not decadent because of the war. They were still working hard and running around, each seeking their own way out. I admire the people of Guangdong. They have a spirit of perseverance and unyielding. They seem to be much stronger and braver than the French in Guangzhou Bay, while the French in Guangzhou Bay all show a kind of wandering and dispirited, lost attitude on their faces. The plane stopped in Taipei City for one night. A friend and I stayed at the Shinkao Hotel. This hotel is first-class in Taipei City. Two people, one night, three meals, with one extra dish for each meal. When I looked at the bill before leaving, I was very surprised. I calculated in my mind that one night and three meals for two people must cost 2,000 to 3,000 savings certificates, which is equivalent to 400 to 500 yuan in current gold, but the bill said 26 yuan. At first, I thought the accountant had missed a zero. After asking again, I realized that there was no mistake, it was exactly 26 yuan. My Chinese compatriots? This is not a small matter. It proves that the strength of the Japanese government is a hundred times greater than that of China, because the power of the banknotes issued by the Chinese government in people's lives is only one percent of theirs. Taking one percent of other people's power to talk about equal cooperation, I am worried for the government. What is gratifying is that the spirit of the Chinese people's hard struggle is definitely not inferior to the Japanese people's spirit of risking their lives for the country. The difference is that the Chinese people lack faith and their spirit cannot be concentrated and developed for the country, while the Japanese people concentrate all their spirit under one belief, and are willing to die for their motherland. From this point of view, China needs political reform and the integration of national spirit. It must go through these two surgeries to achieve the goal of [national construction must be successful]. In the current situation, I want to ask: Our compatriots in Shanghai, do you have the courage to reform politics and the determination to [integrate spirit]? Among the various publications that Mr. Chen gave me, Mr. Yoshida Toyu's article attracted my personal attention the most. He is a Japanese scholar, but he has learned the ability to speak for China. Some Chinese people suspect that he is lying. I don't know Mr. Yoshida. It wasn't until Mr. Chen invited me to dinner that he introduced me at the table. I am not qualified to guarantee whether he is a liar, and I only admire him. I don't completely agree with what he said. To be honest, I think his research on Chinese affairs has only reached the stage of entering the hall, not yet entering the room. A China expert cannot be made in eight or ten years. I have one thing that I can testify to the Chinese compatriots on behalf of Mr. Yoshida, that is, the lying skills of ordinary Japanese people are generally below the level of ordinary Chinese people. For example, there are thieves in China, and there are also robbers in Japan, but nine out of ten Chinese thieves refuse to confess when they are caught by officials; Japanese robbers are only worried that you can't catch them. If they are caught, nine out of ten will honestly confess when asked. This is one proof that Japanese people's lying skills are quite low. Secondly, some Chinese people commit suicide, and some Japanese people also commit suicide. Chinese people commit suicide by hanging, swallowing opium, and drowning; Japanese people commit suicide by disembowelment, jumping into volcanoes, or sleeping on the railway and being crushed to death by trains. Studying the different methods of suicide between the two countries, the psychology of the people in the two countries is different. Chinese people still have some meaning of lying in death, implicitly. Because hanging can still be untied and rescued. Swallowing opium can still be lavaged and intestines washed. Drowning can still be thrown into the net of a fisherman and rescued. As for the Japanese, once they die, they are dead, because the belly is cut open and cannot be sewn up again. Jumping into a volcano turns into ashes. Under the train, there is no complete body. Their suicide is a genuine and honest suicide, while the Chinese contain the hope of [Lishan Old Mother][saving people from danger]. Even at the moment of death, there is still a 70% or 80% plan. Therefore, I use the lying skills of ordinary Japanese people to measure Mr. Yoshida. I believe that eight or nine out of ten of the words he published are from his heart, and not deliberately showing off to us. As for whether what he said is correct or not, it is up to the readers to decide freely. My travelogue will also come to an end here for the time being.</p>
<h3>160 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over Taiwan</h3>

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 14th: (1) On the 14th, a total of about 450 enemy carrier-based aircraft attacked various parts of Taiwan twice. In the afternoon, about 100 B-29 aircraft flew from China, but they retreated without dropping any bombs. (2) Since October 12, about 160 enemy aircraft have been shot down over Taiwan, as far as is known at present. The Japanese side has suffered some losses of aircraft, ships, and ground facilities. Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM on the 14th: The Japanese Air Force has recently continued to attack the enemy mobile unit on the eastern sea of Taiwan. The battle results confirmed so far (including those announced this morning) are as follows: Three aircraft carriers sunk, three ships of unknown type sunk, one destroyer sunk, one aircraft carrier bombed and destroyed, and one ship of unknown type bombed and destroyed. Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Central Pacific dispatch, the enemy's attack focus on Peleliu Island since the morning of the 12th has shifted to the Mount Mizuho area in the central highlands. A large number of enemy troops entered a part of Mount Mizuho under the attack of flamethrowers, but the Japanese garrison forces launched a fierce night attack that night and completely repelled them. On the other hand of Peleliu Island, the enemy seems to be reorganizing and repairing damages. According to reports, the flamethrowers used by the enemy in this battle have hardly played their effect due to the Japanese side's special defensive devices. Bali Papan, 14th (Central News Agency) - Recently, the air raids by the U.S. Air Force on Bali Papan have become more and more frequent. After intercepting by the local Japanese army, from September 30 to October 10, a total of 40 B-24 aircraft and 7 P-38 aircraft were shot down, and 44 B-24 aircraft and 5 P-38 aircraft were destroyed, totaling 96 aircraft.</p>

<h3>Acting Chairman Chen Broadcasts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The 14th is the anniversary of the independence of the Philippines. Acting Chairman Chen made an exchange broadcast that evening. The original text is as follows: [Today is the anniversary of the independence of the Philippines. On behalf of the 450 million people of the Republic of China, I would like to pay my unlimited respects to your country. Although the Republic of China has fortunately not been colonized by Britain and the United States among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, it is not far from the situation of being a colony. Therefore, the pain of your country in the past is the pain of China, and the glory of your country's independence and liberation today is also the glory of our country. Our country and your country can be said to share weal and woe. Therefore, today the Republic of China extends its greatest respect to your country. On this most celebrated day, our two countries should not forget that although the liberation of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia has been realized, it has not yet been completed. First, because the Greater East Asia War is in full swing, in order to complete this immortal and great cause of Greater East Asia, all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia should unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression. Not only should the land of Greater East Asia not be reduced to colonies of Britain and the United States and the people of Greater East Asia become people exploited by Britain and the United States, but also we should ensure that there will never be such unjust and inhumane things in Greater East Asia forever. Second, we should remember that there is still an India among the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, which is still used as a battleground by Britain and the United States, and is used as a rear area for re-aggression against Greater East Asia. We should help them achieve freedom and liberation with one heart and one mind, so that all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia can be completely liberated and completely independent. We already know that your country is suffering in order to seek thorough liberation, and it is at the most important juncture. We express our deep sympathy and concern for your country, and we are preparing great assistance, hoping that the people of your country will intensify their efforts to complete the great cause of the genuine liberation of the Philippines. Your country must be joyful and happy today on the anniversary of independence. At the same time, the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia are also joyful and happy for your country, and are preparing to support your country's complete independence with all their strength. I wish your country freedom forever and independence forever].</p>
<h3>Philippine President's Broadcast Address</h3>
<p>Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the anniversary of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines, President Laurel exchanged broadcasts with Japanese Prime Minister Koiso. The main points are as follows: Today is the anniversary of the independence of the Republic of the Philippines. On behalf of all the Filipino people, I would like to express my deepest gratitude for all the congratulatory remarks given by Your Excellency. Today's world is actively building a new order. The independence of the Philippines has been one year old, and I have infinite feelings. At the beginning of the founding of the country, although we have suffered hardships, on the contrary, we have been able to overcome these hardships and, at the same time, better savor and cultivate our destiny. This difficulty is an excellent test for us. All the hardships we have suffered will become the foundation for consolidating our resistance, strengthening our unity, and achieving success in the future. Grasping this unwavering belief, I believe that our hopes will be gradually realized. This anniversary is also a good opportunity to re-recognize our national beliefs. In other words, we have discovered that we are at the time when we can fulfill our mission under the grand and upright position of the new world order. We are determined to fully cooperate and understand our Japan, and at the same time, we firmly believe that the Greater East Asia War, which aims to promote the rights of all ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, will be victorious. I believe that the Japanese people's determination to move towards final victory will be able to connect the total power of 1 billion people in Asia. Here, I would like to express my deep respect to the Japanese people.</p>

<h3>Reasons for Past Changes and Suggestions for Future Countermeasures</h3>
<p>The recent Shanghai market price problem has become increasingly serious, and all parties are extremely concerned. Citizens are eagerly awaiting the authorities to respond. Mr. Xu Tianshen, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, in addition to answering the questions raised by reporters on the matter at yesterday's 13th press conference, made a comprehensive report on the city's entire price problem and expressed his opinions. First, he explained the importance of wartime price policy and the price changes over the past year. Next, he pointed out the crux of the price problem and the process of establishing the Price Review Committee. Next, he listed the types of official prices and agreed prices. Finally, he proposed countermeasures for managing prices in the future and several suggestions to the central government. The report lasted for one hour and the content was very important, sufficient to serve as an indicator for handling price problems in the future. The full text of his report is recorded below: Today's press conference in this city, I am invited to attend the report on the price issue in this city. The mayor is most concerned and attaches great importance to this issue. I believe that you and all citizens are also most concerned and attach great importance to this issue.</p>
<h3>The Most Serious Moment</h3>
<p>The price problem in this city has now reached the most serious juncture, but the problem is complicated and involves many aspects. It cannot be explained clearly in a few words. However, the success or failure of the price policy can determine the success or failure of the entire controlled economy. It is not only closely related to the future of the Great East Asia War, but also the key to social stability lies here. To ensure the victory of the Great East Asia War, it is necessary to stabilize the prices in the rear. This is something that everyone already knows, so I don’t need to elaborate on it. Speaking of it, wartime price increases are a natural trend. According to general observations and the summaries of economic experts in the past, the reasons for wartime price increases are nothing more than: (1) shortage of material production and reduced sources; (2) decline in the purchasing power of money; (3) concentration of population and imbalance between supply and demand; (4) inconvenient transportation; (5) merchants taking the opportunity to manipulate, hoard, and speculate; (6) anxiety in the market, buying and storing materials, and spitting out loans, etc. But I believe that there are other special reasons for the continuous surge in prices in this city that cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>Three Major Trends</h3>
<p>Let me talk about the course of price changes over the past year. Since taking office, under the wise leadership of the mayor, I have been concerned about the price problem day and night, and have been constantly working hard to stabilize the work, but all efforts have been ineffective. Among them, there were three major trends. The first trend occurred from December of last year to January of this year, because the coal panic triggered a general surge in prices. The second trend was in May and June of this year, because the price of rice suddenly soared from 4,000 or 5,000 yuan to over 9,000 or 10,000 yuan, which then promoted a general surge in prices. The third one has been since last month and has not yet stopped. In this trend, the black market price of gold soared, restricting the use of electricity, stimulating the panic of manufacturers; furthermore, the Mi Tonghui's repeated changes in the method of prohibiting the free entry of rice have caused the price of rice to rise to more than 14,000 yuan, and the black market price of coal has risen to more than 100,000 yuan. Such a surge is really chilling to think about. Just imagine, how can ordinary citizens and the working class live? If this continues, the future is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>The Failure of Effort</h3>
<p>Why is it that our efforts have been uniquely ineffective against these three waves of price surges? The ideal is very simple: because the price problem is a comprehensive problem. It is not a problem of one industry or one item, nor is it a problem of one place or one city. It is necessary to gather the central and local governments, the Allied powers, government and public, all trades and professions in our country, to work together, strive in unison, and make overall plans before there is a possibility of thorough resolution. If partial control is implemented, at most it can only achieve the point of treating a headache when the head hurts and treating a foot when the foot hurts. Because the root of the disease cannot be eradicated, only temporary relief is achieved, and thus the disease becomes cyclical. When suppression begins, prices temporarily stop rising. After some time, the old disease recurs, and the rising tide begins again, with even greater force.</p>
<p>Not only that, prices are comprehensive, whole, and interconnected. If rice prices cannot be stabilized, then the prices of all commodities cannot be stabilized. But rice prices are not easy to stabilize alone; other prices must be stable before they can be stabilized. If coal prices cannot be stabilized, then the prices of all commodities cannot be stabilized, and coal prices cannot be stabilized alone; other prices must be stable before they can be stabilized. This can be applied to the prices of all commodities. Therefore, we advocate managing prices. The prices of all commodities, whether controlled or uncontrolled, must be managed simultaneously. To assess prices, one should take into account the general price level. Then, the power of price management and the power of price assessment should be centralized and unified; at least, it should not be the case that multiple industries and businesses manage themselves, assess themselves, and act independently. However, the current control system seems to adopt separate controls for one industry or even one item. Although they can be connected to each other, the dispersion of management power ultimately violates the unity of prices. Therefore, everyone strives to stabilize the prices of goods, but the result is that no one can do anything. We all know that to stabilize prices, we must first stabilize necessities. However, the prices of the most important necessities, such as rice, flour, coarse grains, kerosene, salt, sugar, matches, candles, bread, milk, meat, eggs, tobacco, vegetables, and local fruits and goods, are not within the reach of our Economic Bureau's Price Assessment Committee. Therefore, at a liaison meeting between the Municipal Government and Japanese journalists, I reported on the price problem and raised this situation. At that time, they were all shocked and sighed. But the fact remains the same to this day.</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive Problem</h3>
<p>According to general principles, prices should increase production, but in Shanghai, prices have risen sharply, and production has declined. What is the reason for this? It is because prices continue to rise, and people's faith in money has been shaken. Everyone is hoarding raw materials and supplies and is unwilling to engage in production. Therefore, the higher the prices, the more production decreases. So, I lament that everyone in Shanghai is now expecting low prices, but on the other hand, intentionally or unintentionally, directly or indirectly, they are all creating high prices or fueling the rise in prices.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I really don't want to say more, and I can't say more. In short, the city's price problem is a link in the comprehensive price problem, and it must be planned comprehensively. Partial treatment cannot be effective. Of course, I will never shirk this partial responsibility. Therefore, let me just talk about the partial price problem of the physical objects managed by our local Shanghai economic organization. (Continued on page 2)</p>

<h3>Deeply Hope China Will Cooperate in Material Resources to Jointly Complete the War</h3>
<p>Japanese Vice Minister Takeuchi Elaborates on Impressions of Visiting China. Allied Japan's Vice Minister Takeuchi of the Greater East Asia Ministry, who came to China for sightseeing, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (14th) from Beijing. He met with Chinese journalists in the city at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, 9th floor. Vice Minister Takeuchi was accompanied by Information Minister Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office and arrived on time. The journalists presented five questions, and the Vice Minister answered them in detail. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Material Assistance</h3>
<p>1. The Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly fierce. What are Japan's hopes for China? (Answer) The Greater East Asia War has become increasingly fierce, and Japan's wartime system has become increasingly solid. The Japanese government's policies are completely aimed at adapting to the current war situation. Therefore, the policies implemented are strengthened. In other words, Japan's economic policies focus on industrial expansion and labor mobilization. Therefore, the preparatory work for the introduction of the system has been launched and implemented, and the national will to fight is even more high-spirited. My hope for China is as follows: At this time when China and Japan are jointly completing the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army is conducting wars in the vast areas of mainland China and the southern Pacific. In order to carry out this operation, a lot of resources are needed. The Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for East Asia, and the nations of East Asia should actively concentrate all their efforts to strive for this war. As for China, the Japanese army is fighting bravely on the front lines, and the materials needed are deeply hoped that China will share this responsibility. Not only China will bear this responsibility, but also the Allied countries in Southeast Asia should also share this responsibility. China is a member of the Greater East Asia. Coal and iron in North China, food in Central China, and other materials are hoped to cooperate.</p>
<h3>Impressions of Visiting China</h3>
<p>2. What is the mission and impression of your visit to China? (Answer) I have no special mission for this visit to China. After attending the ceremony in Manchuria, I came to China for sightseeing, from Beiping, Nanjing to Shanghai, to inspect the various wartime situations in various places. The impressions gained in North China are as follows: I have seen the situation in various places and cooperated enthusiastically, which is a very good phenomenon and very happy. At the same time, I learned that the harvest of Chinese-produced patterned wheat is smooth, and the rice harvest is also good. The grain is the basic problem of stabilizing people's livelihood. I am very happy to learn about the good phenomenon of Chinese grain. The same is true in Central China, which is very optimistic. At the same time, I have passed through the cities of North China and Central China, and I have expressed my feelings a lot. The cleanliness and vitality of the streets are a manifestation of China's economic prosperity. I am very happy from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<h3>Price Countermeasures</h3>
<p>3. What are your impressions of the three major cities of Beiping, Nanjing, and Shanghai during this trip? (Answer) The most common and serious problem that I have seen in the major cities during this trip to China is the rising price problem. However, the government has taken appropriate measures. The price countermeasure is the countermeasure to the inflation of currency. The national government is working hard for this, and Japan is also making the greatest effort to help in terms of this currency and materials. Not only now, but also in the future. The people of all countries feel the pain of the price problem. Therefore, to solve the price countermeasure, the government authorities should try their best to solve it, and the people should also stand up to cooperate, and the military, government, and people should work together to solve the rising prices.</p>
<h3>Liberate East Asia</h3>
<p>4. What is the economic construction plan for Greater East Asia during the decisive period of the Greater East Asia? Please show me one or two. (Answer) Regarding the construction plan of Greater East Asia, the declaration in the Greater East Asia Conference in November last year was adopted based on construction. This is the construction of Greater East Asia. According to the alliance treaty signed between China and Japan last year, and Japan's new policy toward China, it is determined based on the moral spirit of the Greater East Asia declaration. All future construction of Greater East Asia will also be completed based on this declaration. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, there has been the independence of the Philippines, followed by the successive completion of the independence of Burma and East India. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is the liberation of one billion people in East Asia. The completion of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the liberation of East Asia. Therefore, all nations in East Asia should overcome all difficulties, assume all responsibilities of each country, and strive to complete the final victory in order to liberate East Asia. This is the first step in the construction of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>5. What are your thoughts on the anniversary of the independence of the Allied Philippines? (Answer) The Philippines was born independently in October last year. Our Japanese government will spare no effort to give the greatest assistance to complete the independent system of the Philippines. After the Philippines completed its independence, President Laurel also made great efforts to establish the wartime system in the country. Now the national system of the Philippines is becoming more and more complete, which is very different from a year ago. Recently, the Philippines declared war on Britain and the United States and joined the East Asian joint front. We express our respect for the determination of the Philippines. Since the independence of the Philippines, the Japanese government has provided great assistance in the economic, cultural, and political aspects to complete the domestic system of the Philippines. The most obvious is that recently the Japanese domestic bank and the Philippine government ordered a loan of 200 million yuan to establish the entire financial system in the Philippines.</p>

The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Association, on the occasion of the second anniversary, coincided with the fifth members' congress, which was held yesterday (14th) at 2:00 PM in the clubhouse on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building on the Bund. Chinese and Japanese members attended enthusiastically and were in high spirits. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese members attended the meeting, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Chen Shaowei, Wu Yunqi, Gu Nanqun, Chen Riping, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Ye Fuxiao, Chu Zhongsheng, and other Chinese members, and Allied Japanese members Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Aoki Takashi, Kurimoto Toraji, Tsutsumi Takashi, Ichihashi Hikoji, and dozens of others. Former Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro delivered the opening speech. Then, Chen Binhe made a report on the association's affairs. Then, the new board of directors was announced and took office on the spot. After the new chairman delivered a speech, Chen Ziyi, Luo Naji, and Masuzawa Renpei were welcomed to join the association. At the end, tea and snacks were enjoyed, which was full of enthusiasm. The list of the third board of directors of the association is as follows: 1. On the Chinese side, Chairman Wen Lanting, Standing Directors Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunqi, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Director Wang Boyuan, Jiang Shangda, Wu Zhenxiu, Chen Ziyi, Chen Shaowei, Chen Binhe, Xu Xiaochu, Ye Fuxiao, Dong Daoning, Tang Shoumin, Yuan Lvdeng, Guo Shun, Luo Naji. 2. On the Japanese side, Vice Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Standing Directors Aoki Takashi, Kurimoto Toraji, Director Kawamura Nijiro, Ikoma Minoru, Kawaguchi Kenichi, Kojima Eizo, Ueba Tetsuzo, Ichihashi Hikoji, Nishikawa Akitsugu, Tsutsumi Takashi, Murakawa Yoshimi, Fukuda Tatsuma, Haga Kinroku, and Nagafuji Sanro, Tachikawa Dansan.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>Chairman Funatsu Tatsuichiro delivered the opening speech, saying: [The enemy, Britain and the United States, have begun to desperately try to attack Japan, and China joined the Greater East Asia War on January 9 last year. At the same time, the Philippines in Southeast Asia also declared war on the enemy on the 30th of last month. In addition, Myanmar and India have successively become independent and joined the war. However, the ambition of the United States and the United States for East Asia has not been eliminated, and it has always invaded as its colony. If the countries of East Asia are invaded by the enemy, they will be reduced to colonies forever in the future. Now, the only way to strive for the final victory is how we should deal with the aggression of the enemy, Britain and the United States, only by working together with one heart and helping each other in the same boat. Therefore, the position of this association is also based on this point of departure. I hope that all of you present here should overcome difficulties, overcome all difficulties, and do your best to achieve the goal. In the past, this association cooperated with the authorities on the problems of fuel and food for the people of Shanghai. This summer, it held several symposiums to contribute the results of the discussion to the cooperation between China and Japan and to promote it. I express my gratitude and hope that you will continue to move forward with the established goals and contribute to China and Japan with the power of one member, then the future benefits will be extraordinary.]</p>
<h3>Wen Lanting's Speech</h3>
<p>The new chairman of the current session, Wen Lanting, said: [Today, this association is holding a second anniversary celebration and the fifth members' congress at the same time. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of this association two years ago, it was named the Industry and Commerce Association, originally hoping that people from the Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce circles would communicate their feelings and be the forerunner of civil cooperation. For the past two years, the Chinese and Japanese members of this association have been moving forward as much as possible towards this goal. However, in fact, China and Japan are now allies who share the same joys and sorrows, which has exceeded the scope of friendship. Therefore, we should go further in the future and practice the work of the alliance. Now, the two countries of China are allied in combat. How should we cooperate and contribute the greatest strength together? Of course, our industry and commerce circles should work hard in the wartime economy, such as increasing production, suppressing prices, assisting in the controlled economy, and developing the national economy. These problems all require the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce circles. However, no matter what wartime economic problem is achieved, the most important thing is to take into account the national conditions, the people's sentiments, and the local environment, so that it can be twice the result with half the effort. Finally, I dare to say without boasting: The rational solution to Shanghai's economic problems depends on our joint efforts very eagerly. At the same time, it can be said: Whether our efforts are appropriate or not will not only have a great impact on the Shanghai region, but also have a very important position in the national livelihood and even in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, I hope that all members, especially members of the Allied countries, will pay special attention to the importance of China's national conditions and people's sentiments, as well as the importance of the local environment, and work together to deal with and solve the wartime economic problems.]</p>
<h3>The Special Tax Sales Should Develop Invoices</h3>
<p>Director Chen Published a Speech. Director Chen of the Special Tax Office of the city spoke to reporters yesterday, saying: [The special consumption tax was originally an important source of tax revenue for the country and local governments under the wartime system. Although the scope of collection is very wide, the burden on the people is very fair. As long as all stores can abide by the law and report and pay the taxes collected on their behalf truthfully, the treasury revenue will naturally increase day by day, and the funds for municipal construction will not have to worry about being insufficient. However, it is a pity that incidents of stores taking advantage of the situation to conceal and erode tax funds are often discovered. Since I took office, I have tried to rectify the situation and ensure that there are no malpractices, so as to live up to the expectations of my superiors. It has now been decided that all retailers, regardless of the size of the transaction, should use invoices as proof. Stores that do not have invoices should print invoices immediately for use in order to facilitate the investigation by this office. As for the citizens who purchase goods, they must ask the store for invoices. If there are personnel from this office inquiring, they should immediately present the invoices for verification as proof. If a store refuses to give an invoice, it means that it intends to embezzle tax funds. The public who purchased the goods should immediately report to the investigation section of this office (Room 258, 3rd Floor, Municipal Government, Telephone No. 12810, extension 36) for factual reporting. Once verified, the store will be severely punished, and a portion of the supplementary tax and fines will be given to the reporter as a bonus to show encouragement. I hope that all stores will take care of their business ethics and never erode tax funds, so as not to interfere with the penalty office. I also hope that all citizens will cooperate with this office as much as possible at any time to maintain national taxes.]</p>
<h3>Household Rice Continues to be Supplied</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter learned from the Municipal Commodity Distribution Office that the supply of household rice in the city will continue. It has now been decided to start the procedures for selling out at the food retailers from the 16th, and the city will be able to universally sell it around the 20th. And the total amount of rice reserves is about 200,000 bags due to the cooperation of various parties, so all kinds of rumors are self-defeating, and citizens do not need to worry needlessly.</p>
<h3>Development Meeting for Local Autonomy Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Local Autonomy Association was initiated by enthusiastic people in the city. Yesterday (14th) at 3:00 PM, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a development meeting. More than 20 people, including Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, and Ding Fubao, attended. Chen Zhongfu was elected as the temporary chairman to announce the purpose of the meeting. Then, Wu Xiaohou reported on the development process, saying that this city is the economic and cultural center and the source of political strategies in the country. In view of the needs of the environment and in line with the expectations of the citizens, the association was initiated to assist in the progress of local autonomy and to promote civil opinion institutions to assist in the implementation of constitutional government. Then, 44 articles of the articles of association were discussed, and Chen Zhongfu, Wu Chengyu, Wu Xiaohou, Chen Dongbai, Shen Tianxin, Shen Simin, Feng Yunchu, and other seven people were elected as standing preparatory committee members.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>O The Humanities Bi-monthly, a comprehensive literary magazine that has been preparing for publication for a long time, will be published today. The writers include Hu Shanyuan and Cai Yibai. The content is new and exciting. All newspaper stands are on sale.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhongxing's Charity Photography Exhibition is in its Last Two Days Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The [Wu Zhongxing Charity Photography Exhibition] organized by this newspaper was the fifth day yesterday. It happened to be Saturday, and even more people came to visit. Wu is an internationally renowned photographer, and his masterpieces are not easily published. This is the first time to hold a solo exhibition in China, and all the products are the crystallization of the past 20 years, so the guests are very crowded. Today and tomorrow are the last two days of the charity exhibition, and there will be no more exhibitions. I hope that comrades from all walks of life who are interested in photographic art will take the time to appreciate it and not miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Mid-Autumn Festival Amusement Tickets Funds Transferred for Assistance</h3>
<p>The Xin Xin First Building, affiliated to the Xin Xin Company, previously co-organized a transfer with this newspaper and the News to replenish the two newspapers' scholarship funds. Yesterday, the company sent a letter saying: [Dear Sir, Xin Xin First Building, affiliated to our company, co-organized the Mid-Autumn Festival Amusement Party with your newspaper and the News on the 1st of the month. It was previously decided that all the income from the business on that day would be transferred as half of your newspaper's scholarship fund and half as the News's loan fund. Today, the statistics show that a total of 497 seat tickets were sold, earning 497,000 yuan. After deducting 11,500 yuan for round-trip transportation and miscellaneous expenses, the actual amount is 485,500 yuan. Now, half of the 242,750 yuan is sent with the letter. Please check and accept it.]</p>
<h3>Charity Sale of Overcoats Donated for Scholarships</h3>
<p>The Sisters Flower Clothing Company at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Qimen Road will hold a charity sale of overcoats at the Dahua Dance Hall on Dashanghai Road from 6:30 to 7:00 tonight (15th). The proceeds will be donated to the scholarship funds of the Xin Xin and News newspapers, which is very commendable.</p>
<h3>Scholarships Received Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xin Xin First Building (funds transferred for Mid-Autumn Festival Amusement Tickets) 242,750 yuan, Ma Wenwo (commemorating the 4th anniversary of vegetarianism and abstaining from killing) 40 yuan, for a total of 242,790 yuan in savings tickets received, with a balance of 4,027,293 yuan.</p>
<h3>Today's Group A Football Match: Huatong vs. Shanghai Police</h3>
<p>Held at Yiyuan at 10:00 AM. There will be a total of 11 football league matches today. In addition to the eight matches in Groups B and C held at Jiaozhou Park and Donghua Stadium, there will be three matches in Group A. Only Huatong will play for the Chinese team, facing Shanghai Police. The match will be held at Yiyuan Stadium at 10:00 AM, judged by Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Tickets are 100 and 200 yuan. Under the leadership of Jiang Yimen, Huatong won the Group A championship with Lianyi in the first small ball league this year. Its strength can be seen. However, Shanghai Police is the police team from last season. In addition to Ke Laituo playing for the Portuguese merchants, the original team has plenty of fighting power. Huatong must be careful to deal with this strong enemy. The other two Group A matches will be held at Jiaozhou Park in the afternoon. The four-way foreign generals will have a showdown. Qiuwendu will face Portuguese merchants, followed by German merchants facing Jilin.</p>

News sent at 7:10 PM, transferred from the first page</p>
<h3>Price Evaluation Committee</h3>
<p>Before I took office, there was already a price evaluation committee established within the Economic Bureau, but because the concession had not yet been recovered, the scope of evaluation was limited to the urban area, so the organization was simple, and due to the environment, it was difficult to promote it in fact. After I took office, I was ordered by the mayor to reorganize the price evaluation committee. I deeply know that the responsibility is arduous, and strengthening the organization is not enough to complete this mission. I planned a plan and asked the mayor to serve as the chairman of the committee, and I planned to serve as the secretary-general. Later, because the mayor was busy with official duties and could not take care of it, he handed it over to me to be the chairman. The members are all concurrently held by the heads of the relevant agencies. Finally, with the intention of strengthening the organization, additional members were hired, so the current members are the heads of the following relevant agencies: 1. Municipal Government, 2. Ministry of Industry, 3. Economic Bureau, 4. Police Bureau, 5. Health Bureau, 6. Distribution Office, 7. Business Coordination Committee, and its affiliated associations: 1. Rice Coordination Committee, 2. Cotton Coordination Committee, 3. Daily Necessities Control Committee, 4. Flour and Wheat Control Committee, 5. Oil and Grain Control Committee, 8. Central Reserve Bank, 9. Media. In the past, the price management of this city followed the methods of the original Old Public Bureau's Material Control Bureau and the old No. 1 District Economic Office. Later, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Industry, it was divided into two types: official prices and agreed prices. Official prices refer to the prices of the most important commodities, which have already been evaluated and announced two months ago. Agreed prices refer to the prices of secondary commodities, which are agreed upon by the guilds themselves and submitted to this bureau for record. The types of commodities with official prices are as follows according to the regulations of the Ministry of Industry: 1. Food category: Rice, flour; 2. Seasoning category: Salt, edible oil; 3. Fuel category: Coal, briquettes; 4. Miscellaneous category: Soap, matches, candles, paper, Western medicine; 5. Clothing category: Cotton, cotton yarn, cotton cloth; 6. Livestock category: Beef, pork.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities</h3>
<p>According to this list of items, the evaluators can only evaluate paper and Western medicine. The prices of other items are controlled by other agencies and are not evaluated by our Evaluation Committee. After careful research and arrangement by the Evaluation Committee together with various industrialists, businessmen, and economic experts, it was determined that the following 100 or so items are daily necessities and must be officially priced and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. The list of these 100 or so items is as follows: 1. Food category - Rice and rice products: Rice, corn, wheat crumbs, zifan. Flour and flour products: Flour, cut noodles, bread, pancakes, fried dough sticks, biscuits. 2. Attached to other foods - Beans and bean products: Soybeans, red beans, dried broad beans, sprouted beans, soybean sprouts, tofu, dried tofu, oily tofu, hundred pages, fermented bean curd. Fresh beans: Broad bean pods, cowpea pods, flat bean pods. Melons: Cucumber, winter melon, eggplant. 3. Vegetable category - Chinese cabbage, Shanghai bok choy, small Shanghai bok choy, vegetable knots, chicken feather vegetables, cabbage, spinach, Da Ke vegetables, leeks, salted Chinese cabbage, salted snow vegetables, potatoes, sweet potatoes, white radish. Southern goods: Daylily, wood ear, bianjian, line powder dry. Fish: Fresh yellow croaker, fresh ribbonfish, salted yellow croaker, salted ribbonfish. Eggs: Duck eggs, chicken eggs. 4. Seasoning category - Soy sauce, coarse salt, sugar, edible oil. 5. Fuel category - Briquettes, firewood, coal, waste wood. 6. Miscellaneous category - Soap, matches, candles, cigarettes, toilet paper, watch core paper, toothpaste, toothbrush, boiled water, exercise books, small regular script books, practice books, writing brush, pencil, newsprint, glossy paper, rough-edged paper. 7. Clothing category - Cotton cloth, cotton, underwear, socks, towels, shoes, wooden yarn. 8. Livestock category - Meat: Fresh pork, fresh beef. Attached aquatic products: Snails.</p>
<h3>Points to Note for Management</h3>
<p>Regarding the management of commodity prices, this bureau has consistently emphasized the following five points: 1. The prices of agricultural and industrial products should maintain equilibrium in terms of exchange relations. 2. The economic interests of producers and consumers should be harmonized. 3. Production should be encouraged, consumption should be economized, and production planning should be implemented. 4. The principle of low prices should be adhered to for people's daily necessities and military supplies. 5. Political power should be guided towards the rear economic construction of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>There are still many aspects that need to be improved in future evaluation work. For example, evaluation standards should be based on cost accounting, so the production costs that constitute the cost should be distinguished, with special attention to achieving the principle of reduction. This bureau has divided general production costs into the following eight categories: 1. Raw materials, 2. Wages, 3. Electricity (i.e., motive power), 4. Transportation, 5. Interest, 6. Production equipment depreciation, 7. Taxes, 8. Operating expenses.</p>
<p>To cope with the current severe situation, this bureau will step up measures to crack down on speculation and hoarding. Regarding the prices of controlled goods, we are separately consulting with the competent authorities in charge of control and convening various trade associations to discuss [autonomous control] measures. In addition, we have strictly ordered each trade association to instruct its member firms to clearly mark the prices of all goods sold, and not to raise prices without authorization. We will also print the prices evaluated by this bureau into booklets to serve as standards for cracking down on illegal price increases. At the same time, this bureau encourages people to report offenses to gather public opinion, and a special task force has been set up within the bureau to gather experts to constantly study countermeasures. We also jointly established a liaison meeting with the Economic Security Department to unify operations.</p>
<h3>Recommendations to the Central Government</h3>
<p>We further recommend to the Central Government to urgently find ways to improve the following matters in order to achieve both immediate and long-term effects: 1. Guarantee the supply of raw materials to producers; 2. Guarantee the supply of electricity to producers; 3. Improve transportation to facilitate the flow of goods; 4. Improve the rationing system, striving to increase the variety and ensure adequate quantities; 5. Economic control agencies should prevent their commercialization; 6. The government should find ways to subsidize the prices and fees of public utilities and should not repeatedly increase prices to avoid stimulating general commodity prices; 7. A central organization for national commodity price control should be established immediately.</p>
<p>Regarding increasing production, in the agricultural sector, this bureau has added a department to effectively promote the agricultural production increase plan promulgated by the Central Government. In the industrial sector, this bureau has contacted the embassy to conduct factory electricity registration to prepare for increasing factory electricity use.</p>
<p>This is a general overview of our efforts in commodity price management. However, we still need to work together with relevant parties such as embassies, consulates, military police, the Economic Security Department, various control agencies, trade associations, and the press. The work is indeed difficult, and the system is indeed imperfect, but it is our duty to do our best, even if it means exhausting our efforts. We hope that you will provide guidance and assistance from time to time so that our work can increasingly approach the goal of stabilizing commodity prices, which is what I sincerely expect.</p>

<p>Expectations of Representatives from Various Countries</p>
<p>The Third Greater East Asia Writers' Conference will be held in Nanjing, China, for the first time. Convening such a cultural international conference of representatives while the fierce flames of war are approaching the country can be said to be an unprecedented feat in history. The international conferences of the enemy, Britain and the United States, are despicable and dirty meetings for dividing spoils, but comparing them with ours reveals that the Greater East Asia War has a true meaning of not invading other people's territories, and at the same time proves how firm our belief in victory is. The Mainichi Shimbun has specially put forward the Greater East Asia Literary Prize and is sparing no effort to assist the conference, and this is its intention. Therefore, it will publish a special issue to collect the determination of writers' representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia for the Oriental cultural conference to be held in Nanjing, the capital of the new China.</p>
<h3>Japan's Riichi Yokomitsu</h3>
<p>As the war intensifies, the international unity of writers becomes more necessary, which is what everyone who hopes for the victory of the Greater East Asia War thinks. The East Asia Writers' Conference initially started as a political demand, gradually became an intellectual request, and further evolved into a planned cultural harmony. Forming a solid natural will into a tangible form is the first such phenomenon since Emperor Meiji.</p>
<p>From a cultural perspective, this is merely a superficial observation. Ignoring this meaning is unwise. It is not something every country can do to hold a cultural festival during the decisive battle while expanding one's vision.</p>
<p>Non-urgent matters should be put behind, but this non-urgent matter put in front at this time can be said to be a practical manifestation of the desire to closely connect peacetime aspirations with decisive battle aspirations.</p>
<p>The war itself, in the Orient, is always a war of harmony, no matter when. The more intense the war, the faster the speed of harmony, but what is manifested everywhere is the harmony of conflict. This is the harmonizing character of the East, which is a natural requirement and is also free of any embellishment.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that East Asian affairs should be resolved by East Asia. I do not want to delve into the reason why such an obvious matter becomes unclear here, but what needs to be known is the fruits of the collective Greater East Asian goodwill, wishes, thoughts, pursuits, and aspirations summarized by the previous conference, which everyone knows. What is hoped for at this Nanjing conference is that past accounts do not need to be settled again, but we must clearly recognize our common enemy among the enemy countries. We must explain the reasons for the lack of clarity to the entire East Asia, and at the same time, we must let the general public know, and even the enemy countries cannot but praise the virtues of the East.</p>
<p>There is no longer a need to explain what war is. It is the time for action. This has certainly become a common saying, but we must further understand the enemy's intentions in this unprecedented and astonishing war. Because concepts are just concepts, they are the most urgent economic actions.</p>
<p>For this reason, cultural aspects, as important as tangible economic aspects like money and materials, can convey the correct meaning of this war, hint at the future, organize the past, and give historical significance to the people of East Asia. This is the new challenge in cultural aspects. The importance of the Nanjing Conference lies in this. Various mistakes are the mother of success.</p>
<h3>China's Gong Chiping</h3>
<p>The Third Greater East Asia Writers' Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on November 12, the anniversary of the birth of the Father of the Nation, with several dozen writers from China, Japan, and Manchukuo. The purpose and significance of convening the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference, as indicated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, is for the countries of Greater East Asia to respect each other's traditions and develop the creativity of each nation, thereby elucidating the culture of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>In the past century, the culture of the four oceans, based on Anglo-American utilitarian thought, has invaded East Asia under the guise of military and economic power, causing great trauma and harm to Eastern culture.</p>
<p>As a result, China, with its 5,000-year-old culture and history, has experienced political corruption, warlord infighting, and social disorder. The purpose of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led by Japan and breaking the Anglo-American invasion to liberate the East Asian nations in this Greater East Asia War is to aim at the Anglo-American invasive culture and strike a fatal blow, while also restoring Eastern culture and developing the inherent culture of each nation. However, thinking of this year as the most urgent life-or-death moment, writers should also join forces with the military authorities to strive for victory.</p>
<p>In other words, now that the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, in order to transform the New East Asia, promote Eastern culture, and build a new world culture, the countries of East Asia should respect each other's traditions, give full play to the creativity of each nation, and mobilize all the cultural figures of Greater East Asia to accomplish our common highest ideal.</p>
<p>The previous two conferences were all convened in Tokyo, but this conference is convened in China, which of course has its special significance. (From Nanjing)</p>
<h3>Philippines' Ignacio</h3>
<p>We also welcome the convening of the conference in Nanjing, because it will determine the uniqueness of Greater East Asian literature on the basis of a strong cultural organization in the New Order. Since the conference is being held under the current difficult decisive battle stage, and because of transportation obstructions, representatives from all countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot attend, so only representatives from Japan, Manchukuo, and the Republic of China will be dispatched. However, if possible, we, the Republic of the Philippines, would like to send at least one representative to attend. I believe it is always a supreme honor to have the opportunity to meet with representatives from various countries.</p>
<p>In this important era, what we writers must recognize is that we must achieve victory in this great war. Only after victory can the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia be completely liberated from under the iron heel, the literary spirit of East Asia can gain freedom, and the necessary atmosphere for fully developing creative literature can be nurtured.</p>
<p>Philippine writers have three hopes for the conference:</p>
<p>First, it was decided in 1942 to send a representative to the First Greater East Asia Writers' Conference in Tokyo, but unfortunately, no speech was delivered. Therefore, at the Third Conference convened in Nanjing this time, no matter how poor we may be, we want to make a small contribution and hope to deepen friendship with representatives from various countries.</p>
<p>Second, the First Conference was convened when the Philippines had not yet achieved independence, but now the Philippines is also an independent country, so today's Philippine writers want to stand on an equal footing with other independent countries and freely discuss everything with the Greater East Asia representatives. At last year's Greater East Asia Writers' Conference in Tokyo, our Republic sent Bautista and me to attend. Writers are also an organism living in this great turbulent era, so they want to often make contact with various countries to gain inspiration.</p>
<p>Third, among all the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, everyone should understand that the Philippines has been under the domination and control of Western European foreign races for 400 years and is in a special state. Therefore, we hope that other friendly countries will sympathize with us and help us become a true East Asian country. If so, it will give prosperity to the entire Co-Prosperity Sphere. Finally, I cannot refrain from saying that even though our battle situation is in such a tight stage, Japan is still concerned about the cultural improvement of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is really grateful. It is grateful to be preparing for the booming cultural flower of the peaceful era after the Greater East Asia victory. (From Manila)</p>
<h3>Thailand's Nuya</h3>
<p>It is truly a miracle and a joy that the countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are convening a grand Greater East Asia Writers' Conference while the war is intensifying. The countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere should use this conference to fully exchange culture, correctly guide the people of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in combat, and hope for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, thereby establishing Greater East Asian culture. To be honest, Thailand has mostly been influenced by French literature. The era of Rama II was an era of translating French literature. During the reign of Rama IV, English literature was temporarily popular, especially Shakespeare, but it was later influenced and dominated by French literature again.</p>
<p>However, after the establishment of the Pibun regime in 1938, together with His Royal Highness Prince Wan Waithayakon, the director of the then National Library, and Mr. Birt, the national essence literature of Thailand was restored, and this continues to this day.</p>
<p>Thailand has produced unprecedented poets such as Sunthorn Phu and Pao (whose famous work is [Golden Mountain]), but unfortunately, there has been no opportunity to introduce Thai literature to the countries of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere until today. The Greater East Asia Writers' Conference to be held in Nanjing this autumn will follow the prosperity of the culture of the countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and complete this introduction, which is of immeasurable significance. (From Bangkok) —Translated by An from the September 16th Mainichi Shimbun—</p>
<h3>Greater East Asia Literary Prize - Assessments in Various Places -</h3>
<p>Amidst the waves of deadly battles, the Co-Prosperity Sphere Writers' Conference for the construction of Greater East Asian literature will be held in Nanjing, and it has been decided that the glorious Second Greater East Asia Literary Prize will be awarded on the last day of the conference. The First Greater East Asia Literary Prize was decided at last year's Tokyo Conference, and award ceremonies were held in Japan, Manchukuo, and China. Unfortunately, the South Seas region did not have the opportunity to win the glory of the First Prize because no excellent works appeared. Therefore, over the past year, the enthusiasm and the absorption of the concept of the New Order in the South Seas region have made rapid progress. The Philippines, Java, Malaya, Thailand, Burma, and other countries have convened assessment committees since August and are working hard to select candidate works.</p>
<p>In Java, a collection of poems called [Hero of the Times] by Manos Muruf, a leading writer in the local literary scene, and a novel called [Not for Me] by Yao Gardahati Majia have been submitted for review. In Thailand, the Thai Cultural Council is currently collecting and reviewing works, because winning the Greater East Asia Literary Prize is also a supreme honor for Thailand, so the Cultural Council's review and assessment are very cautious and serious. In Japan, more than a dozen works, including [The Founding of Manchukuo] by Kenichi Kenta, are being discussed by the assessment committee. In Manchukuo, [Rebirth] by Guding is said to be the most promising. In China, Kusano Shimpei is leading the assessment, and he is painstakingly selecting works every day.</p>
<p>What kind of work and which writer will win this glorious Greater East Asia Literary Prize will certainly attract the attention of the people of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the Allied countries, especially the enemy areas such as Chongqing and India, will also become the focus of attention. Therefore, we have great expectations and want to select a great masterpiece that shakes the soul of our Co-Prosperity Sphere nations.</p>
<p>In addition, the assessment committees in Japan, Manchukuo, China, and the four regions of the South Seas will complete their tasks within the next month and immediately submit them to the General Review Committee in Tokyo for the final decision. At the same time, preparations will be made to announce the decision to the people of All Asia before the meeting. The members of the Second Greater East Asia Literary Prize Assessment Committee in Japan are: Akira Asano, Tomoji Abe, Sei Ito, Tatsuzo Ishikawa, Saburo Okada, Jiro Osaragi, Katsui Ichiro, Tetsutaro Kawakami, Yasunari Kawabata, Tamio Tomizawa, Sadao Togawa, Misao Niwa, Dai Haga, Yoichiro Yasuda, Riichi Yokomitsu, and 15 others.</p>
<p>The members of the Final Decision Review Committee for the comprehensive review of the works from the four regions are: Shiro Ozaki, Kan Kikuchi, Masao Kume, Haruo Sato, Retsu Saito, Kyoji Shirai, Kotaro Takamura, Yoshio Toyoshima, Yoshio Nagayo, Murofu Nakamura, Hakucho Masamune, Saneatsu Mushanokoji, Yuzo Yamamoto, Eiji Yoshikawa, and 14 others. In addition, Shiro Inoue, the Head of the Literary Arts Division of the Japanese Government Information Bureau, and Sadajiro Kurosaki, the Culture Minister of this newspaper (Mainichi Shimbun), will also participate.

<p>In my childhood memories, besides being full of innocence and mischief, it seems strange that I developed a fondness for a little girl at that time, and I still deeply miss her to this day. She was my fellow villager and classmate, and it should have been seven or eight years ago.</p>
<p>The Central School in N Town is a famous elementary school. In this school, I smoothly completed the orthodox basic curriculum. I remember when I was entering the first semester of the fifth grade, I noticed her presence in the same class. With her round face, an adorable smile, a nimble figure, and elegant demeanor, I felt that she was a very lovely person. Perhaps it was the unique reserve of a young girl. She didn't like to talk to people much, so her surface didn't have the unrestrained enthusiasm of a southern girl, but she always exuded infinite purity and sincerity in solemn calmness. She was intelligent and excelled in all subjects, especially in Chinese and spelling. Her works were often published on the wall newspapers organized by the alumni association, and she wrote beautiful calligraphy, which won the praise of teachers and students throughout the school. At the end of the semester, her academic performance was either first or second in the entire grade.</p>
<p>I don't know who arranged it, but during the four semesters of senior elementary school, she and I sat at the same desk in the same class. Because we were closer, we established a friendship that was different from ordinary relationships. In the morning light and under the evening glow, we walked side by side to school or home. On weekends, we often strolled in the garden, on the road, and in the fields, casually discussing various academic problems. In this frank and innocent friendship, our knowledge progressed silently together.</p>
<p>After graduating from elementary school, a long summer vacation separated us. Whenever I was cooling off on a summer night, I would naturally think of her, her round face, her beautiful smile... A burst of inexplicable joy would flash through my heart. Regarding her character and her studies, it was like looking up at the stars in the dark sky, giving me a feeling of nobility and brightness.</p>
<p>Soon, we met again in the first-year classroom of the business school at S Middle School. I felt that she was becoming more beautiful and lovely as a young girl should be than before, but she still maintained the same silent, studious spirit as in elementary school. After extracurricular activities, other students were noisy, fooling around, or going home, but she always buried herself in the books in the library or quietly read by the small stream behind the campus. Sometimes she and I would appear at the same place at the same time, under the trees in the square, or on the stone steps by the clear stream, and after she greeted me familiarly, she would lower her head and quietly read her book. Perhaps because she was a little older, she was no longer as unreserved between boys and girls as before. But when I occasionally glanced at her back, she would secretly turn her head to look at me, and when I caught her, she would give me a charming smile without saying a word. Once, the school held a student work exhibition, displaying excellent papers and notebooks from students of all grades separately, and I found that she spent most of her time carefully reading my [Life Diary] notebook. When I walked up to her, she hurriedly pretended to be looking at other people's notebooks. I still can't figure out why, a young girl's heart.</p>
<p>Her tireless efforts enabled her to achieve above-average results in all aspects, and her name was routinely praised by teachers and students throughout the school. Before the summer vacation, the school held a school-wide gathering, and she received the most prestigious special prize from the principal. In a burst of warm applause, her apple-like face became even redder and more beautiful. This beautiful radiance symbolized her future shining with unparalleled brightness.</p>
<p>Then, the scorching summer came with the god of war, and the entire town fell into scorched terror. We separated in the rubble, and that was seven or eight years ago. Such a long time, and now at the ends of the earth, I wonder where she is living?</p>
<p>Opening the curtain of youth, I feel like a lonely traveler in a desert land, but when that familiar image of a round face and a beautiful pen reappears in my heart, I no longer feel lonely. I seem to hear the sound of matching footsteps in front of me. How can I not keep up?</p>
<p>Who is she? What is her surname and what is her name? Please forgive me for not explaining further. Anyway, there is such a classmate that I will always remember in my heart.</p>
<h3>A Father's Lament</h3>
<p>— Xu Jialing</p>
<p>I am a father of ten children, and I blame myself for this. In this day and age, I've raised such a large brood of little monkeys. Monkeys can perform tricks and earn money, but my bunch only want to eat, wear clothes, and study, without earning a single penny. Of course, I can't blame them for not earning money, because I haven't invested enough in them. I wish I could stretch them all up instantly, which would save a lot of rice and shorten the tormenting time; at least I want to blow them up one by one, so they don't look all skinny and yellow, making me sad.</p>
<p>The eldest is studying at university, the second and third are in high school, the fourth is in junior high school, the fifth, sixth, and seventh are in elementary school, the eighth stays at home, the ninth just learned to walk, and the tenth is still breastfeeding. Fortunately, my sons and daughters are ambitious; the eldest got a scholarship, the second and third got student loans, the fourth is completely free in school, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh are all getting fee reductions, which really lightens my burden as a father. But the cost of supplies for a semester is still considerable! People always say that I am lucky to have such a large group of children, and that they are all ambitious and willing to study. I am certainly very happy, but the shadow of life will soon drive my happiness away.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I suddenly have strange thoughts: Why do my children want to study so much? How great it would be if they weren't so keen on books! The eldest could work in a bank, the second could be a nurse, the third could be a trainee, and the fourth and fifth could be apprentices… Alas! They could help me so much! At least they could take care of themselves, but they just love books… Alas… Of course, I know this idea of mine is completely wrong, but I still often think about it.</p>
<p>Every month, we need to eat at least one *shi* of rice, burn one *dan* of coal briquettes, and there's oil, vegetables, rent… It really makes me dizzy, but I only earn 6,000 yuan in reserve notes. Even though I've quit smoking and drinking, it's still not enough! As for how to get through the days, I'm a bit confused; it seems like enduring grievances, sleeping out of frustration, going to the pawnshop, arguing with my wife, hitting the children…</p>
<p>In fact, my wife is indeed miserable enough. Her family was originally very well-off, and she had been enjoying a good life since childhood. Now, she's followed me, this poor devil, and has really suffered a lot of grievances. There are no servants at home; from morning to night, she cooks, washes vegetables, washes clothes, all by herself. When she has free time, she has to teach the eighth to read, watch out for the ninth falling, and breastfeed the tenth… Sometimes, she even has to go to relatives to borrow money, helping to find ways to make a living. I also understand her virtue and diligence, but for some reason, I often argue with her, making everyone shed tears.</p>
<p>In the morning, to save coal briquettes, we buy snacks to eat. The seventh brought in a *dabing youtiao* (flatbread and fried dough sticks), eating as he walked. I said to my wife, "Look, why did you give him a whole *dabing youtiao*? What if it makes him sick! Next time, just give him a *dabing*, that's enough." The child seemed a bit embarrassed, but didn't dare to cry. My wife silently made the bed. In fact, I also know that a *dabing youtiao* is definitely not harmful for a nine-year-old child, especially since he'll have thin porridge for lunch today! I love my children and want them to grow up fair and chubby, living like little princes, but for some reason, I'm being stingy with a single *youtiao*.</p>
<p>Whenever prices jump, my wife always sighs and says, "We should buy this thing soon, we should buy that thing soon." I often want to take the money out of my pocket and tell her to go buy it. But when I calculate the days, there are still half a month before payday, and I can't help but sigh and answer her, "Well, the poor always eat expensive goods."</p>
<p>Of course, I also have happy times. For example, when the eldest gets the best prize, the second and third get first place, the fourth gets above 95 points… The ninth can bring me slippers and hang up my hat, and the tenth can call me "Papa." At this time, I can't help but rejoice that I have such a group of good children, and I fantasize about the future world. Involuntarily, a few drops of hot water squeeze out of my eyes.</p>
<p>But the real-life problems are pressing in front of me again, and I don't know when this fantasized future world will arrive.</p>
<p>My only comfort is this fantasized future world; otherwise, I would have given up on living long ago.</p>
<h3>The Riddle of Life</h3>
<p>— Ni Xiaotong</p>
<p>When a person enters the world, he is ignorant and unaware; but in the moment before death, he is still bitterly making a final struggle! When he is babbling, he seems to be happy like an immortal; in childhood, he is truly innocent; but in adulthood, he is always thinking wildly!</p>
<p>If he is praying and burning incense, he is speaking one thing but thinking another; once he comes into contact with society, he lies about everything about himself; when he reaches the stage of employment, he naturally becomes a soulless liar!</p>
<p>When his hair turns white and his teeth fall out, he cannot help but long for his past; but he cannot help but feel sad! But not long after he dies silently, he is forgotten by people!</p>
<p>Ah! This is the riddle of life! (For Aid to Education)</p>

<h3>On Viewing Mr. Wu Zhongxing's Photography Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Jiaxi</p>
<p>In recent years, the trend of calligraphy and painting exhibitions in Shanghai has been very popular, and there have been many photography exhibitions as well. However, Mr. Wu Zhongxing's photography charity exhibition, which is currently being held, can be considered the most satisfying one.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is fully engaged in photography in his spare time, and has continued to study and refine his skills for more than 20 years, so his achievements and attainments are very valuable. Mr. Wu enjoys a high reputation internationally, and has been selected for international exhibitions several times. However, Mr. Wu's works are not well known in his own country, which is the result of his dedication to his work and his lack of self-promotion. This time, at the invitation of this newspaper, he is holding a charity exhibition to help students, which is also the first time that Mr. Wu's photographic works have been publicly seen by the audience!</p>
<p>Among the works on display are masterpieces that have participated in overseas exhibitions, as well as recently completed works that have not yet been published. Although there are only a little over a hundred pieces, they are all representative works, giving people a sense of being overwhelmed by their beauty. For example, "Double Purity" has won many praises in overseas exhibitions, and fully expresses the color beauty of oriental books in photographic technology. "Warm Spring in Wuling" also gives people an unforgettable impression with its bright colors and light. "Snow on a Stream Bridge," "Snow Bamboo," and "Snow on a Fishing Beach" give people a sense of being in the severe winter. "Playing with Objects" makes good use of the contrast of strong light, which is very skillful. "Pagoda Reflection on a Stream Bridge" and "Jade-like Running Spring" add a variety of colors, further emphasizing the expressiveness and realism of the image. The even and appropriate coloring also shows that the author is also a master of coloring. From "Autumn Light Gladly Reaches the Bamboo Fence" and "Frozen Sparrow," we can also know that the author is a master who likes to draw materials. The above are all the author's strengths, which are worth noting and solemnly introducing.</p>
<p>Hundreds of viewers who came to appreciate photography filled the venue, and they concentrated on staring at the images. Not only were there Chinese people, but also many expatriates from Japan, Germany, the Soviet Union, and other countries. In the past two days, many articles introducing and criticizing the exhibition have also been published in foreign-language newspapers. This is of course because art has no borders, but the author's works are rich in strong appeal and undeniable charisma, which cannot be ignored.</p>

<h3>Post-Viewing of the Two Charity Football Matches: An Examination of the Strength of This Year's Top Four</h3>
<p>— Bixian</p>
<p>This year's football league has already begun last weekend. There was only one match in Group A, which was a friendly match between Lianyi and Erti. The strength was too disparate to be worth discussing. However, there have been two charity football matches, with the opponents being the four major giants of Chinese and Western football: Donghua, Lianyi, Qiaolian, and Pushang. At the beginning of the season, fans are overjoyed to see such a good show. After watching the two matches, the author feels that the Group A league will not escape being dominated by these top four teams. Therefore, I will briefly describe the two charity matches and then comment on these top four teams.</p>
<h3>First Match Ends Unhappily</h3>
<p>The first charity match was held last week between Donghua and Qiaolian. Last year, Qiaolian suffered the humiliation of six defeats, so the team was eager to vent their pent-up anger in this match. Therefore, after the start of the match, all that could be seen was the Hu'er players running wild. The Donghua players, caught off guard, only knew how to defend. However, ultimately, their experience and skills were not inferior to their opponents, so they were still able to take a 2-0 lead. Unexpectedly, just when they thought they had a sure win, the foreign players had plenty of stamina, and scored three goals in a short period of time, coming from behind. With more than ten minutes remaining, Qiaolian left the field in protest of the referee's decision, resulting in an unhappy ending, which was a bit of a disappointment. Based on this match, I will comment on the two teams.</p>
<h3>Donghua</h3>
<p>Last year, their sharpness created a new record, winning every match without a single defeat, which was commendable. There is a saying: "If you don't advance, you retreat, like sailing against the current." In this match, Donghua clearly showed no progress, and even a few players seemed to have regressed. This is certainly a common phenomenon at the beginning of the season, and should not be overly criticized. However, after examining the ambitions of the other strong teams this season, and their recruitment of new players, the author earnestly hopes that Donghua will practice harder and constantly improve their skills. Then, it should not be difficult for them to win the championship again this year.</p>
<h3>Qiaolian</h3>
<p>Their exquisite individual techniques and abundant stamina have long been recognized by football fans. What they lack is the ability to use their brains and cooperate well. If they can improve these two points, there is no limit to how far they can go. In their first appearance this season, it was felt that they still did not use their brains enough. However, they have already paid attention to the team's cooperation. Their performance was no longer just relying on brute force as before, and there were some small moves and delicate passes. If they can further refine and improve their tactics, then this year's Qiaolian will be a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<h3>Second Match Shows Lianyi's Excellence</h3>
<p>The second charity match was held this Wednesday, also at the Racecourse, with Lianyi taking on Pushang. With the addition of two young players, Luo Shoufu and Gao Xiuqing, Lianyi's front line has washed away its past sluggishness. In addition, the rest of the old players have been practicing hard during the summer, and their physical strength has improved, resulting in an excellent performance. Pushang also did their best to distribute their lineup, taking both offense and defense into consideration. Therefore, the match was extremely intense. Lianyi ultimately relied on their combined efforts to exert their maximum power. Young player Gao Xiuqing was particularly outstanding, scoring two goals, and they defeated the talented Pushang by a score of 4-2, which was not easy. Both teams showed significant improvements.</p>
<h3>Lianyi</h3>
<p>The individual skills of their players were superior to those of other teams. Last year, they quietly withdrew midway, for their own reasons, causing fans who loved their skills to sigh in vain. However, the scattered spirit of the team members last year is also an undeniable fact. This year, the team is determined to restore its reputation. In addition to inviting new players, the old players are also striving to improve. Therefore, the entire team has already returned to its original state, and the two new players are indeed capable, so their performance has its merits. Their aggressive style is certainly different from Donghua's delicate style, but it has a kind of loveliness that is pleasing to the eye. I hope they will continue to move forward, and there are great hopes for them this year. Cheer on, Lianyi players!</p>
<h3>Pushang</h3>
<p>This year's lineup distribution is very thorough. Veteran players such as Costan and Baoxiuo have joined forces, which is no different from a disguised version of the once-powerful French team. Although they lost to Lianyi 2-4 in the previous match, it was really a symptom of the "early season disease." Based on their well-organized lineup, experienced veterans, and cunning tactics, they will definitely improve as the season progresses. Although they may not be able to win the championship in the league in the future, they will definitely be a major threat to the two strong teams, Donghua and Lianyi.</p>
<p>In summary, the four teams mentioned above are the most likely to win the championship in Group A of the football league. The next most likely is the Shanghai Police team, which has not yet shown its face, and may have unexpected results. Today, the Shanghai Police team is playing Huatong in their first match, which will show us what they are like. But no matter what, they will not be as good as the four strong teams mentioned above.</p>
<h3>The Division of Strength Among the Teams in Group A of the *Shenbao* Cup Basketball League is Already Clear</h3>
<p>— Jiemei</p>
<p>Since the start of the *Shenbao* Cup basketball league, although it has only been a little over a week, the division of strength is already clear. Last week, the author introduced the strength of the ten teams in Group A, which has now been confirmed. Currently, the teams that remain undefeated are Hualian, Zhongbei, Dahua, Shante, and Huanan, while the teams that have already lost are Mingxing, Huaying, V Team, Renyu, and Tongren. Each has their half, and the boundaries are very clear. Although this cannot be taken as a final conclusion, the general order will not change much.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of the teams over the past week, it is felt that the promising teams are all scheming and competing with each other. For example, the Hualian team has recruited Western star Brett and is about to bring in the northern star Chuan Jinsheng to help. Their ambition is beyond words. And the Zhongbei team has Zhao Zhilin, Li Baozhong, and others staying in Shanghai, and has also obtained the addition of national player Yin Huanwen. Thus, the strength of the north is melted into one furnace. In the future, the bloody battle between these two strong teams will be a rare event in recent years. Currently, fans are already using the battles of Hua, Zhong, and Da as talking points. The next most likely is the Dahua team, which also has ambitions to contend for the championship. The sudden appearance of veteran players such as Zhen Xianglong, Xu Wenkui, and Lu Zhongen is clear, and they will definitely be strong rivals to Hualian and Zhongbei in the future. As for the young players of the Shante team, their skills are improving day by day, which is obvious to all. Whether they can have a transcendent harvest in the future depends on their experience and adaptation on the field, and it is difficult to predict to what extent. The other teams all have good spirits, and they will definitely use all kinds of tricks to win in the battle for fame and position, and strive to perform their skills to win the appreciation of fans, adding a glorious and happy chapter to this basketball cup.</p>
<p>Also, among the matches next week, the match between Dahua and Shante on Friday will be the most eye-catching. The situation of the two teams is developing. Although it is not a battle for the championship, its impact on everyone is very important. Therefore, this match is allowed to be the most stimulating scene after the start of the *Shenbao* Cup.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Miss Huang Xingfen, the mainstay of the Yuan Team's women's volleyball team, has been a leader in the volleyball world for more than a decade. As a veteran, she does not let down those who come after her. Miss Huang is scheduled to marry Mr. Yang Yicheng, a giant in the business world, on the 21st of this month. It is expected that after the marriage, it will be difficult to see Miss Huang's style on the court.</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun, the goalkeeper of the Donghua football team, is also good at basketball. He serves the Dahua team in the *Shenbao* Cup and performs very well. His wife must come to support him every game, so he is very energetic. Mrs. Zhang is gentle and quiet, and also has research on basketball. She often points out things to Mr. Zhang, which is a good partnership with like-minded people.</p>
<p>After the death of Jia Youliang's father last month, a memorial service will be held today at Zhuangyan Temple on Beile Road. The Jia brothers have a wide circle of friends, and it is expected that there will be a grand funeral. (Jing Duan)</p>
<h3>The Sports-Loving "Yang Family"</h3>
<p>The Dahua men's and women's basketball teams are well-known teams in Shanghai. The players have excellent skills and a humble attitude. Their leader, Mr. Yang Shuding, is in charge of everything, and his achievements are remarkable. Whenever the team plays, whether it is in Group A or B, he personally goes to the field to guide them. He also visits other sports competitions and has a strong interest in them. It is said that Mr. Yang is nearly sixty years old, but he is full of energy and is a giant in the financial world. He and his wife and children visit sports competitions, and they are very happy. His son, Yuan Kai, is a valuable entrepreneur of Qianjin. Yuan Long is currently a professor at St. John's University and a famous player on the Dahua team. His daughter also likes to play ball, and the residence has a court. The whole family loves sports, and people like to call them the "Modern Yang Family." (Yuān)</p>
