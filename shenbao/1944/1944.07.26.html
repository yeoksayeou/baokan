<h3 id="c1">救救苦學生 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨今兩天本報舉行中小學生助學金甄別試　，計新舊　請學生共五千餘人。他們的家境清寒，有各學校校長負責的證明書，並經本報同人分別抽查。（如若還有不察之處，將來更願讀者多多檢舉）。他們的學業程度，均比一般普通的學生優秀，亦有各學校發給的成績報告書可以證明。助學金的標準是「清寒優秀」四個字，　請的人既然都是清寒優秀，為什麼還要經過考試？唯一的原因。就在經費的不足。我們要把讀者們的捐款，充分造就最優秀的人才，因此就不能不犧牲一部分成績比較略次的學生們。然而這一批考試雖然落選的學生，在學校裏的萬貫可是已經都在一般同學之上，假如繼續求學，共　就亦一定比普通人高超，所以下學期這一批學生失學的原因是全國同胞所不願意的，在家現在難道就眼看這一般優秀小同胞扮演，而坐視不救嗎？</p>
<p>替下一代的同胞，設法謀受教育的機會，是本報同人最願意做的工作。我們認定，中華民國成立了三十三年，中國的一切不上軌道，致使一般應該就學的　年不能夠有就學的機會，至少現在在社會上做事的人都應當負點責任。三十三年不能把中國做好，這是我們的罪過。我們要懺悔以往，努力未來，而教育下一代的助學運動便是一件最切實最易見效的事情。這個信念，不僅本報同人如此，相信每個同胞都是如此。</p>
<p>昨天看到成千的清寒學生，由他們的父母兄妹們伴著來應考。穿的雖然不很整齊，卻都是清潔樸素，體格上雖然因為營養關係不很強壯，卻都是精神飽滿。進了考場，對號入座，秩序井然，足見平時訓練有素。學生們在考場裏專心做著考題，家長們在校外專心等候。這幅「應考圖」和「送考圖」，使我們辦事人回想到我們以往讀書時候的印象。我們在一二十年以前的求學費用還便宜，可是我們當時投考時的心續怎樣？那時伴著我們的家長們的心裏在是怎樣？那時候這一個水蜜桃不錄取，還有其他的學校可進。現在這一般青少年們可不是這樣了，今日不被錄取，至少下學期要失學。讀者諸君們！試閉目想一想，分號同在我自己是一個求助學生，假如我現在是一個求助學生的家長，我的心緒是怎樣的焦急？讀者諸君們！請再想一想，我的讀書怎樣完畢的，假如以往受過人家的幫助，現在應該立即幫助人家。我的事業怎樣成功的，晃晃由於許多有的同志協助而成，那末，現在就應立刻替下一代造就許多有知識的同志，使我的事業繼續發展。</p>
<p>第逢考試的時候，我們總愁著經費的不足，可是，每次我們向讀者們呼籲之後，我們總得到意想不到的效力。因為有讀者們做後質，有讀者們鼓勵我們，我們更敢自信助學運動的成功。學費增加了，求助學生增多了，我們更敢斷言讀者們的助力也一定是源源不斷的增加。我們因此更願意為這一般清寒優秀學生一而再，再而三的請命。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日新閣具體施策強化軍政間聯絡　以大和傳統精神完成戰爭 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東應二十五日中央社電　日本小　新內閣，以負起一新人心，完成戰爭之重大使命而登場，刻雖尚未闡明新內稅指導作戰之具體方策，但親夫小　新首相當內閣組成後所發表之談話，撞見記者團所發表之談話　及新幾閣中心人物杉山陛想些。米內海相之談話等，均充分表明繼續前內閣加強作戰施策，振起大和一致之日本傳統精神，而向完成戰爭之途邁進之決意。由此可　知新幾閣今後之具體施策，約略如次：</p>
<p>指導作戰之方針，日本作戰之目的，已在　戰大　中闡明，當然不能因內閣之更選而有所變更二十三日小磯新首相，東條前首相官錯了辦交接手續時，　談約曆一時半之久，推測當係東條前首相向小磯新首相詳細說明前此指導大戰之全幅　　，對繼續指導作戰事宜，作萬無遺憾之　　，想新內閣循前此作戰大綱之細目，當更有應處決戰時期之最善方策。</p>
<p>大和一致之具體實現，小磯新闑了初之談話中，斷言突破空前國難之途徑，惟有國民大各一致，舉總力摧毀英美之反攻。所謂大和一致者之堅固理念，而表明今後施政之決意。但此種精，已在新內閣人事結合中實現，即小磯首相與米內大將，不但共同拜受大命組閣，且自大尉時代，即為知交，而小磯首相之興杉山陸相，更有同窗之誼，共他閣　亦均在平沼內閣，米內內閣愚人節，有共同參劃政務之關係。此種內閣之人和，更以　政會之全面協力，不　為總力戰之體制。</p>
<p>陸海軍之緊密化，軍務與國務之密不可分，實為戰時體制下日本絕對必要之態勢。善於兩者之如何調整，小磯新首相，會有將向日大本營，政府間聯絡會廣鐵更行強化之言。尤其對陸海軍緊密協同作戰有莫大影響者，即小磯首相同　陸軍元老杉山元帥之就任陸相及海軍元老米內大獎之歸現役，就任海相，由於人的配合，陸海軍之關係，已益緊密，在些種態勢下，當能發揮最大之戰力也。</p>
<p>戰意之昂揚，小磯新首相會謂，　意之昂揚，亦　於大和一致。又緒方新情報局總裁會謂。為使上下相互，加重信賴，須率直闡明時局真象，避免子國民以錯誤之安全感，而促國民自覺，此舉實為必要，故關於此點，新內閣之大將率直之措　，實至堪期待。</p>
<p>外交政策，童光外相之留任，且兼任大東亞相，實為日本戰時外交一貫方策，與大東亞外交方策毫無變更之證據。小磯新首相會謂，對於盟邦德國，決將從來緊密　之關係更為加強，而向達到共同目的之途邁進，更力　對於蘇聯決斷續維持現在敦厚之關係，必須使相互間毫無不快之感，闡明日本戰時外交毫不因新幾閣之成立而有所變更。並謂，對於大東亞各民族，期　毫無遺憾，　　其人心，東條內閣之總辭，實即如其掛冠辭中所謂，其目的在將完成戰爭之態勢更為強化，解放大東亞建設共勞團之方針，均無所變動。盡在此重大戰局下，大和一致之方針，當然亦期待大東亞全域於確立收改人心方策，今後當逐次具體實現。</p>

<p>東京　五日中央社　著名海軍軍事專家伊勝正　，頃不日艦隊之動　　　，馬利亞納　　附近，有以大批航空母艦為主力之敵數個機動部隊，刻在　　中。料一般　均　疑日　何以不出動將其擊退，照聯合艦隊自六月十九·二十兩日出擊之後，即未再行出動，究為何故，舉凡日本國民，內心當有此疑問，該疑問唯有以理解釋余相信此方由於時機尚未成熟所致。以戰理言，所謂公算尚未成立於此為公算者，即指（一）彼我現有勢力（二）第二次會戰之補給兵力，（三）以戰場地　而言，除此之外，尚須考慮戰鬥技術否則不應出動主力艦隊，必須有計畫為後盾，　恩出動，雖為猛將，亦非名將，若忽視公算，初等突進，則其愚由此可知。我聯合艦隊之不出動。乃基於公算之道理者，然今後即永遠本諸公算之理念而不出動之我艦隊，決不能作如此無為之待機，實乃在充實公算待機出動。盡前述第一點之兵力差額，使交戰合理　下降最多者，　為飛機，所謂「制　權下艦隊決戰」之戰術思想，實起源於一九三八年美軍巴拿馬學習之時，及日聯合艦隊在台灣海上學習時，確認此點後，日空軍兵力即遂年增加，觀大東亞戰爭　戰中，日海軍之戰　當可明　。今日空軍乃　絕對必要者，艦隊於制空　失敗後，只有退避，別無妙策，因此我艦隊正待空軍兵力集結於今日之磊戰場上，且對此期待甚　前述每二點，謂於一戰場，必有第某次會戰之時，則成為決戰，於此必須考慮決戰中所需之兵力，主力艦隊。不可玉碎。又前述第三點，乃為可使其他兵力協同作戰之戰場為具備以上之基本條件，日艦隊，作　複之局部猛攻，激　複激鬥，版圖早日獲得活動之良機，恐我艦隊本身較國民尤熱　此機會之來臨。現我艦隊採取「艦隊保存主義」，即避免即所謂「公算」之決戰，保全艦隊主力之戰略方針，然此種主義，若　止於此，則無其大意義，必須有「反攻精神」，始有意義，必見機即把握公算，出而與敵作戰功之鬥志，乃屬必要，若能恢復集中兵力至某種程度，檢討第二會戰，還至有利之戰聲，樹立擊　敵軍之計劃，則忍耐相當時期，保其艦隊，亦為　全之戰略。</p>

<h3 id="c6">日本內閣更選的意義 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— 隱公</p>
<p>日本東條內閣於十八日總辭職之後，陸軍重　　　「朝鮮之虎」的小磯　昭大將與海軍長老兼為國家重臣的米內光政大將即受命組閣。新內閣已於二十二日成立，其中綱　各方後　，陣容更加堅強，這強有力的新內閣的出現，必能「一新人心，俾眾國向完膀戰爭之途邁進」，　是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>日本內閣這次的改組，在加強作戰姿態，決意貫徹勝利一點上，當然有很大的　　意義。不過此事的發生，適在塞班島　　之後，英美宣傳機關必定要大放　　，　　　　，認為日本已　　於「難局」戰爭　　　　　　，　　　　　事政治攻勢的成功，　本是間距之事。　到是非，　　　白，　造謠言，搖惑人心，本是他們的慣技。不過這種不　事實的宣傳，以之　　自己，自欺　天下人，亦徒風心勞日　，空格極無聊而已，</p>
<p>日本內閣的這背改組，不過是人事的進　的加強，戰爭體制，受絲毫影響，戰時根本國策，更不會因此而有變更，這從小磯首相的談話和廣播講演中以及新內閣的中即可見到。這次內閣的更選，在東條內閣，則自開戰以來，　年有餘，已盡最大之努力，樹立赫赫的功績，目下已　決戰開關，自覺實任重大，必須有更　力的內閣，領導全國，　成戰爭，於是乃辭職讓　。在新內閣，則小　米將大將受命於軍　大時局之下，尋事組成眾國一致的堅強陣容，向完成戰爭取得勝利之途邁進。由此而觀。日本　舉國決戰體制不但不受內閣改組的影響，並且因內閣的改組而更見強化。日本戰時根本國策，不但不因內閣改組面變更，並且將出新內閣而貫徹之。此次戰爭，不僅為日本興亡所　，並且為東亞各民族的生殖開頭。在這反英美反侵略戰爭中日本以東亞民族領導地位。一成與我國訂立同盟條約，一面聯合東亞各國發表大東亞共同宣言，東亞各民族在大東亞宣言下已結成休　相關　　與共不可分　的關係。還就是日本的根本　　。這次日本內閣改組。　大的日約。亦　是要求　根本國策的實現。誠如小磯首相所言：「對外可始終堅持從來之外交方法。　　實現大東亞共同宣言，以無　大東亞戰爭」。可見日本內閣雖經　　，　　　不　　，　　　作有力的遂行，善於這點，英美當局也沒是見不到如美國務卿赫而　稱：「日本更迭內閣後吾　必須充分覺悟，日本已重新樹立改　之作戰計畫。」前任美國駐日大使格　也發表聲明，謂「日本內閣雖已更迭，然日本戰鬥到底之戰爭方針，並無變化，日本民族不　生死之傳統　神，已根深蒂固，美國民由於日內閣之更迭，即　前途　　　　，劃作　　　　，實　危險」　國　　　有此確切的　　，而其宣傳機關仍　日本內閣改組為日本戰時　　　　的崩潰而磊　宣傳，　　　　，欺　　人，何等矛盾，何等　　！</p>
<p>日本這次的新內閣，　　過不變的定　來外，還有　國　　，組　　　　　，　　軍的緊密聯繫。這次小磯陸軍大將與米內海軍大將同時拜受大俞　，協力組織聯立內閣，此興實　明治三十一年六月改進　大　重信與自由黨板　　助的敵黨聯立內閣之後而為日本政治史上第二度聯立內閣。現在小磯大將　居首　，而以杉山元帥為　相，　寶上之副米內大將為海相。海陸軍的聯繫緊密化，更可促成戰時體制的強化。第二，眾國一致的實現。小磯·米內內閣的　　，有　　　的政界元老　田忠治，有貴族　的　玉秀　，有　政會的　務　　前田　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　共濟時艱，誠不愧為舉國一致的內閣。第三，各德政部門皆由具有　　經驗者擔任，新內　十五名閣員中，計有十一人均為兩任乃至四之大臣經驗者，自可各本經驗，駕輕就熟，　　推行戰時行政，提高戰時行政效率。上述三點是小磯內閣的物質，基於這三點特質結成堅強無比的陣容，實現戰時體制的強化。時局　雖然嚴重，ｌ　ｗｔｆ縱然艱　，這以戰時新姿態出現的小磯·米內內閣必定能夠擔當，　妝英美，完成戰爭，　東亞民族爭取和獨立。東亞十億人民此時更應該加強勝利信念，發揮團結精神，共同向反英美　　　　勝利決戰之　　　　　　　　　完成大　　　　　　　　　　。</p>

<p>中央海軍學校第六期軍官學生，中央高等商船學校第一期學生開學典禮，昨（二十五）日上午十時半，在南市龍華路中央海軍學校舉行。茲分誌各情如次：</p>
<p>長官來賓</p>

<h3 id="e1">Save the Poor Students <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday and today, this newspaper held the selection examination for primary and secondary school student scholarships, with a total of more than 5,000 new and old applicants. Their families are poor, with certificates from the principals of various schools and spot checks by colleagues of this newspaper. (If there are any oversights, we hope readers will report them in the future.) Their academic performance is better than that of ordinary students, and there are also transcripts issued by various schools to prove it. The standard for scholarships is the four characters "poor and excellent." Since the applicants are all poor and excellent, why do they still have to take the exam? The only reason is the lack of funding. We want to fully cultivate the most outstanding talents with the donations from our readers, so we have to sacrifice some students with slightly lower grades. However, this group of students who failed the exam are already above average in school. If they continue their studies, they will definitely be more outstanding than ordinary people. Therefore, the fact that this group of students will drop out of school next semester is something that compatriots across the country do not want to see. Now, are we just going to watch these excellent young compatriots lose their education and sit idly by without helping?</p>
<p>Finding ways to secure educational opportunities for the next generation of compatriots is the work that the colleagues of this newspaper are most willing to do. We believe that since the Republic of China has been established for thirty-three years, China's problems remain unresolved, causing many young people who should be in school to not have the opportunity to attend school. At least those who are working in society now should take some responsibility. Not being able to improve China in thirty-three years is our fault. We must repent of the past and strive for the future, and the scholarship movement to educate the next generation is the most practical and effective thing to do. This belief is not only held by the colleagues of this newspaper but also, we believe, by every compatriot.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we saw thousands of poor students accompanied by their parents, siblings, coming to take the exam. Although their clothes were not very neat, they were clean and simple. Although their physique was not very strong due to nutrition, they were all full of energy. Entering the examination hall, they took their seats according to their numbers, and the order was orderly, which shows that they were well-trained. The students were focused on the test questions in the examination hall, and the parents were waiting anxiously outside the school. These "exam-taking picture" and "sending-off picture" reminded us of our impressions when we were studying in the past. The cost of studying was cheaper one or two decades ago, but what were our feelings when we took the exam at that time? What were the feelings of the parents who accompanied us at that time? At that time, if you were not accepted by one school, there were other schools to go to. Now, these young people are not like that. If they are not accepted today, they will at least drop out of school next semester. Dear readers! Please close your eyes and imagine, putting yourself in the shoes of a student seeking help, if I were the parent of a student seeking help, how anxious would I be? Dear readers! Please think again about how I finished my studies. If I have received help from others in the past, I should immediately help others now. How did my career succeed?

<h3 id="e2">Nisshinkan's Concrete Measures to Strengthen Liaison between Military and Government, Completing the War with the Traditional Spirit of Yamato <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — The new cabinet of Prime Minister Koiso, assuming the great mission of renewing the spirit of the people and completing the war, has not yet clarified the specific policies for guiding operations under the new cabinet. However, the statements made by Prime Minister Koiso immediately after the formation of the cabinet, the statements made to the press corps, and the thoughts of the central figures of the new cabinet, such as Army Minister Sugiyama and Navy Minister Yonai, all fully demonstrate the determination to continue the operational policies of the previous cabinet, to revitalize the traditional Japanese spirit of Yamato unity, and to advance towards the completion of the war. From this, it can be known that the concrete measures of the new cabinet will be roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The guiding principle of operations, the purpose of Japan's operations, has been clarified in the Great East Asian War, and of course, it cannot be changed due to the change of cabinet. On the 23rd, when Prime Minister Koiso took over the handover procedures from former Prime Minister Tojo, they talked for about an hour and a half. It is speculated that former Prime Minister Tojo explained in detail to Prime Minister Koiso the full scope of the previous guidance of the Great War, and made every effort to ensure the continued guidance of operations. It is thought that the new cabinet, following the detailed items of the previous operational outline, will have the best strategy for dealing with the decisive battle.</p>
<p>The concrete realization of Yamato unity, Prime Minister Koiso asserted in his initial statement that the only way to overcome unprecedented national difficulties is through the great unity of the people, using all their strength to destroy the Anglo-American counteroffensive. He reaffirmed the solid concept of Yamato unity and expressed his determination to implement policies in the future. However, this spirit has already been realized in the personnel combination of the new cabinet. Prime Minister Koiso and General Yonai not only jointly received the imperial order to form a cabinet, but also have been close friends since their days as lieutenants. Prime Minister Koiso and Army Minister Sugiyama also have the friendship of classmates, and other cabinet members also have the relationship of jointly planning government affairs in the Hiruma cabinet and the Yonai cabinet. This kind of harmony in the cabinet, further enhanced by the full cooperation of the political parties, is not limited to the total war system.</p>
<p>The intensification of cooperation between the Army and Navy, the inseparability of military affairs and state affairs, is an absolutely necessary situation for Japan under the wartime system. Regarding how to adjust the two, Prime Minister Koiso has stated that he will further strengthen the liaison between the Imperial Headquarters and the government. Especially having a great influence on the close cooperation between the Army and Navy in operations is the fact that Prime Minister Koiso and Army Elder Sugiyama were appointed as Army Minister and Navy Elder Yonai returned to active service and was appointed as Navy Minister. Due to the coordination of personnel, the relationship between the Army and Navy has become closer, and under this kind of situation, the greatest combat power can be exerted.</p>
<p>The boosting of morale, Prime Minister Koiso said that the boosting of morale also lies in Yamato unity. Furthermore, Director-General Ogata of the new Information Bureau said that in order to increase mutual trust between superiors and subordinates, it is necessary to frankly clarify the true state of the situation, avoid giving the people a false sense of security, and promote national self-awareness. This measure is really necessary. Therefore, regarding this point, the frank measures of the generals of the new cabinet are truly worth looking forward to.</p>
<p>Diplomatic policy, the retention of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and his concurrent appointment as Minister of Greater East Asia is evidence that Japan's consistent wartime diplomatic policy and the Greater East Asia diplomatic policy have not changed at all. Prime Minister Koiso said that regarding the allied country of Germany, he is determined to further strengthen the close relationship that has existed and move towards the goal of common achievement. Furthermore, he is determined to continue to maintain the current cordial relationship with the Soviet Union, and it is necessary to ensure that there is no unpleasant feeling between them. He clarified that Japan's wartime diplomacy will not change at all due to the establishment of the new cabinet. He also said that regarding the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, he hopes to win their hearts without regret. The resignation of the Tojo cabinet is just as he said in his letter of resignation, the purpose of which is to further strengthen the state of preparedness for the completion of the war, and the policy of liberating Greater East Asia and building a common labor group will not change in any way. Under this major war situation, of course, the Yamato unity policy also expects the entire Greater East Asia region to establish policies to win hearts and minds, which will be concretely realized gradually in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Planes Attack Lingling <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>A Certain Place on the Japanese Front Line, 25th (Central News Agency) — On the night of the 2nd, the Japanese air force in China carried out a surprise attack on Lingling, burning twelve enemy small planes and destroying six more. In addition, they destroyed underground facilities, causing seven fires, achieving fruitful results. The enemy air force, which retreated to Guilin and Yanjiang, hoped to regain their losses by cooperating with the Chongqing army. The Japanese air force units launched a surprise attack, destroying most of them. However, the enemy's underground artillery fire was extremely fierce and fired at the Japanese planes, but all the elite Japanese planes returned safely.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) — The Chongqing authorities issued a public statement on the 24th, admitting that the Japanese troops attacking Hengyang had entered the city of Hengyang, and also announced that new battles had broken out in the northern area of the city.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Naval Expert Discusses Fleet Operation Policy: Japanese Navy Prepares to Counterattack and Annihilate the Enemy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — Renowned naval military expert Ito Masanori recently discussed the movements of the Japanese fleet, stating that in the vicinity of the Mariana Islands, there are several enemy mobile units with a large number of aircraft carriers as their main force, currently engaged in operations. It is expected that the general public is wondering why the Japanese fleet has not deployed to repel them. After the Combined Fleet launched its attack on June 19th and 20th, it has not deployed again. What is the reason? All Japanese citizens must have this question in their minds. This question can only be explained by understanding. I believe that this is because the timing is not yet ripe. In terms of military theory, the so-called probability has not yet been established. By probability, I mean (1) the current strength of both sides, (2) the replenishment force for the second battle, and (3) the battlefield terrain. In addition to these, combat techniques must also be considered. Otherwise, the main fleet should not be deployed. It must have a planned backup. A general who deploys without considering these factors, even if he is a brave general, is not a famous general. If he ignores probability and rushes forward, his foolishness will be obvious. The reason why our Combined Fleet has not deployed is based on the principle of probability. However, from now on, our fleet will never wait passively based on the principle of probability. It is actually accumulating strength and waiting for deployment. To reduce the force difference mentioned in the first point as much as possible to make engagement reasonable, air power is the most important. The tactical thinking of "fleet decisive battle under air supremacy" originated in 1938 during the U.S. military's study in Panama and the Japanese Combined Fleet's maritime study in Taiwan. After confirming this point, the Japanese air force's strength increased year by year. This can be clearly seen in the Japanese navy's battles during the Great East Asian War. Today, air force is absolutely necessary. If the fleet fails to gain air supremacy, it has no choice but to retreat. Therefore, our fleet is waiting for air force strength to gather on today's battlefield and is eagerly anticipating it. The second point mentioned above, that there must be a certain number of battles in a battlefield before it becomes a decisive battle. Here, the force required for the decisive battle must be considered. The main fleet must not be annihilated. Also, the third point mentioned above is that the battlefield must have the basic conditions for other forces to cooperate in operations. The Japanese fleet is making repeated local attacks, repeatedly engaging in fierce battles, and the high command is eagerly awaiting the opportunity to be active. I am afraid that our fleet itself is more eagerly awaiting the arrival of this opportunity than the people. Currently, our fleet is adopting the "fleet preservation policy," that is, avoiding the so-called "probability" decisive battle and preserving the main force of the fleet. However, this kind of policy has no great significance if it stops there. It must have a "counterattack spirit" to be meaningful. It is necessary to seize the opportunity to grasp the probability and go out to fight the enemy. It is necessary to have the will to win. If it is possible to restore the concentration of forces to a certain extent, review the second battle, return to an advantageous battle voice, and establish a plan to defeat the enemy, then enduring for a considerable period and preserving the fleet is also a comprehensive strategy.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Significance of the Japanese Cabinet Reshuffle <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Gong</p>
<p>After the Japanese Tojo cabinet resigned en masse on the 18th, General Koiso Kuniaki, an army heavy weight known as the "Tiger of Korea," and Admiral Yonai Mitsumasa, a naval elder and national statesman, were ordered to form a cabinet. The new cabinet was established on the 22nd. After coordinating various aspects, the lineup was further strengthened. The emergence of this powerful new cabinet will surely "renew the spirit of the people and enable the nations to move towards the completion of the war." This can be asserted.</p>
<p>This cabinet reshuffle in Japan certainly has great significance in strengthening its combat posture and determination to achieve victory. However, this event occurred soon after the fall of Saipan. The Anglo-American propaganda agencies will surely exaggerate and believe that Japan has fallen into a "difficult situation" in the war, and consider this political offensive a success. It is their habitual trick to distort the truth, create rumors, and shake people's hearts. However, such propaganda that does not conform to the facts, using it to deceive oneself and the world, is just a waste of time and effort and is extremely boring.</p>
<p>This reshuffle of the Japanese cabinet is merely a personnel strengthening. The war system is not affected in the slightest, and the fundamental national policy during wartime will not be changed as a result. This can be seen from Prime Minister Koiso's talks and broadcasts, as well as from the new cabinet members. In this cabinet reshuffle, the Tojo cabinet, since the beginning of the war, has done its utmost for more than two years and has established remarkable achievements. Currently, as the decisive battle is about to begin, it feels that its responsibilities are heavy and that a more powerful cabinet is needed to lead the nation and complete the war, so it resigned. In the new cabinet, Generals Koiso and Yonai were ordered to form a strong lineup united by all nations under the current military and political situation, and to move towards the path of completing the war and achieving victory. From this, it can be seen that Japan's system of national mobilization for the decisive battle is not only unaffected by the cabinet reshuffle but is also strengthened by the cabinet reshuffle. Japan's fundamental national policy during wartime will not only not be changed due to the cabinet reshuffle but will also be implemented by the new cabinet. This war is not only for the rise and fall of Japan but also for the beginning of the reproduction of the various ethnic groups in East Asia. In this anti-British and anti-American war of aggression, Japan took the leadership position of the East Asian nations. On the one hand, it signed an alliance treaty with our country, and on the other hand, it united the East Asian countries to issue the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Under the Greater East Asia Declaration, the East Asian ethnic groups have formed a relationship of shared destiny and inseparable interdependence. This is also Japan's fundamental national policy. This cabinet reshuffle in Japan also requires the realization of fundamental national policies. As Prime Minister Koiso said: "Externally, we can always adhere to the previous diplomatic methods and achieve the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, so as to complete the Greater East Asian War." It can be seen that although the Japanese cabinet has undergone changes, its fundamental policy has not changed. It is just making more efforts to implement it effectively. The British and American authorities cannot fail to see this. As U.S. Secretary of State Hull said: "After Japan's cabinet change, we must be fully aware that Japan has re-established a revised operational plan." Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew also issued a statement saying, "Although the Japanese cabinet has changed, Japan's war policy of fighting to the end has not changed. The Japanese people's tradition of not fearing life and death is deeply rooted. If the American people think that the future is bright because of the Japanese cabinet change and make a rash judgment, it is really dangerous." Since the United States has this accurate understanding, yet its propaganda agencies still declare that the Japanese cabinet reshuffle is the collapse of Japan's wartime system and create false propaganda to deceive people, how contradictory and ridiculous!</p>
<p>In addition to the unchanged policy of this new cabinet in Japan, there are also three points worth noting: (1) A stronger lineup; (2) A closer connection between the army and the navy; (3) The realization of national unity. This time, Army General Koiso and Navy Admiral Yonai received the imperial order at the same time and cooperated to form a coalition cabinet. This is only the second coalition cabinet in Japanese political history after the coalition cabinet formed by Okuma Shigenobu and Itagaki Taisuke of the Liberal Party in June of the 31st year of Meiji. Now, General Koiso holds the top position, with Marshal Sugiyama as the Army Minister and Navy General Yonai as the Navy Minister. The close connection between the army and navy can further promote the strengthening of the wartime system. Second, the realization of national unity. The members of the Koiso-Yonai cabinet include the political elder Nagata Chuji, the aristocrat Hachisuka Masaaki, and the executive director of the Yokusan Seijikai, Maeda Yonezo. They all share weal and woe and are truly worthy of being a cabinet united by all nations. Third, all administrative departments are staffed by those with rich experience. Among the fifteen cabinet members of the new cabinet, eleven have experience as ministers for two or even four terms. They can all draw on their experience, easily handle their jobs, promote wartime administration, and improve the efficiency of wartime administration. The above three points are the qualities of the Koiso cabinet. Based on these three qualities, a strong and unparalleled lineup is formed to realize the strengthening of the wartime system. Although the situation is serious and the difficulties are numerous, this Koiso-Yonai cabinet, appearing in a new wartime posture, will surely be able to bear the burden, defeat Britain and the United States, and win independence for the East Asian nations. At this time, the one billion people of East Asia should strengthen their belief in victory, give full play to the spirit of unity, and jointly move towards the final decisive battle for victory against Britain and the United States and complete the great cause of the Greater East Asian War.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) — According to a Geneva special dispatch of the 15th from the New York Daily Mail, the diplomatic envoys of various countries who recently met with Führer Hitler stated that Hitler has unwavering confidence in the development of the war situation. Although the war situation is extremely pressing for Germany, those around Hitler believe that the German army has the strength along the line, or is preparing to use new weapons or new tactics in experimental enterprises, or is planning changes in political motives. Regardless of the reasons, Führer Hitler, Marshal Goering, Dr. Goebbels, and other Nazi leaders have expressed their determination in the past few days. Some diplomatic circles also expect important events to happen. Among the various speculations, the absolutely certain one is that Führer Hitler has fully realized the serious situation, maintains a calm attitude, and is preparing some kind of event that will shock the world.</p>

<p>Speech by Naval Minister Ren</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of Naval Minister Ren's speech: "Today, the sixth class of naval students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy are holding a solemn and grand opening ceremony here. I am grateful for the presence of the esteemed guests and officials from our allied nation, which adds great honor to the students. I hope the students will deeply remember today's impressions. Today, you are formally appointed as naval students and advanced merchant marine students. Although the two schools are nominally different, they are actually under the guidance of the same president, and can be said to be two but one. Naval students are responsible for serving our country's navy, and merchant marine students, of course, should focus on developing commerce in essence. However, at this critical juncture, the navy and maritime transport are equally important. Although the two schools have some different subjects, they are the same in spirit. The government's reason for establishing the Advanced Merchant Marine Academy in one place is also this. I would like to clarify this meaning, and I hope that everyone will have a deep understanding of it and always have this concept. The establishment of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy this time is due to the cooperation of our allied nations and the merchant marine industry. Not only does the school itself express its gratitude, but the government also expresses its deep gratitude. It is not easy for you to be admitted today with the assistance of all parties. I hope that you will all act as students with the spirit of the navy. The past graduates of the Central Naval Academy have all served in the naval industry and have achieved good results, which can be a good example for you. In the future, you should work hard in school, prepare to serve the navy, devote yourselves to your studies, and fulfill your ambitions. You have all been selected from many outstanding young people, and your grades must be very good. At the same time, the foundation of the school is now better than before. I hope you can use the good foundation and the spirit of the senior classmates to sincerely accept the president's guidance, cultivate a good school spirit, establish the navy's reputation, and prepare to contribute to the Greater East Asia War."</p>
<p>Speech by President Jiang</p>
<p>Today is the opening day for the sixth class of students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy. At the same time, it can also be said to be the opening day of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy. I am extremely honored that Minister Ren, Chief Advisor former Lieutenant General Tanaka, and all the officials and guests have come to provide guidance and instruction. Especially the Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, which is established within the Naval Academy, is a perfect combination and complements each other, which can be said to be a new undertaking of epoch-making construction under the Greater East Asia War system. The painstaking efforts and great planning to promote this new undertaking are truly immortal achievements. I would like to express my sincere gratitude and admiration.</p>
<p>From today onwards, the new navy and the new maritime transport have accepted the contributions of a hundred and dozens of young men. You glorious and promising new students resolutely bid farewell to your families and parents, left your lovely hometowns, traveled through mountains and rivers, and passed the preliminary and follow-up tests. For the sake of the nation and for the victory of East Asia, you have dedicated yourselves to the vast ocean. In order to realize the new navy and the new maritime transport you have envisioned, you must first accept the will of the ocean, which is solemn and vast, and follow the spirit of the ocean, which is bright and lively. In the school, you must be single-minded and uphold the training of soldiers of the army, navy, and air force, as well as the school motto of wisdom, depth, courage, and determination. Strengthen your beliefs, be indomitable, and be sure to gain thorough knowledge, never content with superficial understanding. Seek pearls in the abyss and obtain the child by entering the cave. If your studies are not completed, do not turn back. You must also study hard and practice diligently step by step, cultivating the five virtues of wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness, and becoming capable generals and cadres with unified aspirations and physique. In the future, you will be able to shoulder the responsibilities you should bear, do what you should do, and promote the maritime spirit of the continental nation. The two major undertakings of the navy and maritime transport should be integrated, promoted hand in hand, and developed together. This is the success of the new navy, and it is also the success of the new maritime transport. The president first blesses this group of lucky children of the ocean, and at the same time blesses the future of the Republic of China and the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Speech by Maeda</p>
<p>Congratulatory speech by Maeda, Chief Military Advisor of the Navy: On the occasion of the entrance ceremony of the sixth class of students of the Central Naval Academy and the first class of students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, I am very happy to be able to participate and meet with all of you who are full of vigor.</p>
<p>Students of the Central Naval Academy, you will surely become the backbone of China's future navy. Your predecessors have worked tirelessly, day and night, and moved forward bravely on the path of rebuilding China's weak navy. Therefore, they were able to lay the foundation for the unified national navy, and they were able to fully protect the stability of the country and cooperate in the war. This is your task. You have been selected as the best among the many, and you have been able to enter the school. In the future, you should abide by the school rules, cultivate your character, and study diligently in order to develop a sound military spirit, and look forward to becoming promising young officers in the future.</p>
<p>Students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, you should shoulder the great responsibility of rebuilding China's shipping industry. The country's expectations for you are heavy and great. Moreover, you are the first class of this school. You must strive to be self-conscious and create a good school spirit in order to create useful senior sailors in the future and realize the reality of serving the country through shipping.</p>
<p>Furthermore, today the students of the two schools are entering the school on the same day, and in the future, they will live and take classes together, and live together. After graduation, they will be active in the rivers and oceans of Shanghai, so you must be friendly and friendly.</p>
<p>Thinking about the autumn when the world war situation is becoming more and more tense, you should use a clear head, observe widely and deeply, understand the great significance of the Greater East Asia War, and complete your own tasks. Always keep today's determination firmly in your mind, be vigilant day and night, strive for self-improvement, and move forward bravely on the path of your own hopes. This is what I expect. Today, on the occasion of the entrance ceremony, I will briefly describe what I have in mind to promote your struggle.</p>
<p>Speech by the Chief Instructor</p>
<p>Congratulatory speech by Chief Instructor Rear Admiral Mori of the Navy, roughly saying: "You have been selected from among the volunteers who are about ten times the number of this year's Central Naval Academy and Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, and I am honored to be able to enter the school today. I would like to express a few words from the bottom of my heart as a congratulatory speech.</p>
<p>The naval and shipping circles are like the two wings of a bird, with a close relationship. Students of the Central Advanced Merchant Marine Academy, you have won the honor of being the first to enter the school, and you should be aware of the importance of your mission. Moreover, the students of the two schools should each move forward vigorously on the path to achieving their own aspirations. At the same time, you should embrace the concept of mutual dependence and helping each other in the same boat, and cultivate a good school spirit. In the near future, after graduation, you will be able to spread this good spirit to the warships and merchant ships of the Republic of China, which is what I hope for."</p>
