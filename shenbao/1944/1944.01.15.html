<p>社評</p>
<h3>强化國民黨仰强化人民</h3>
<p>—一個目的兩種方法—</p>
<p>日本每日新聞社評，近以「期望於南京首腦部」（譯文見今日本報第一版）為題，論述強化國民黨之必要性與急迫性，其結論大意，國民黨可以組織民衆，使國府與足衆結合，如能迅速實現強化，則國府易於發展，對於大東亞戰爭必有非常貢獻。</p>
<p>國民黨是國民政府的母體，國民政府是從國民黨產生，這是衆所共知的。而國民黨領導份子天都參加政府，担任高級官吏，這也是衆所共知的。惟其國民黨領導份于大都從政，誠如每日新聞社評所言，國民黨就變成了無「實」的「果皮」，徒有其名。我們認為如果要求強化國民黨，必先強化領導國民黨的優秀陳客，從事黨二，凡是一個政黨，必須具備完善的政綱與政策，而所謂政綱與政策，其對象並不是為黨員的利益而設定的，是為民衆的整個利益而設定的，所以，這個黨的政綱與政策，才會使民衆瞭解，才會受民衆擁護。這樣的黨才能本身強化，發生領導作用。</p>
<p>根據上面的論點，國民黨後歷史上以　，是國民政府的母體，有悠久的歷史，有數百萬黨員，有顯明的主義，有完備的政綱，可是，究其實際，則黨員對於黨之認識與信仰如何？是否忠實地為主義服務？政綱的設定，縱是以民衆整個利益為對象，而執行者是否忠實？是否使民衆瞭解？是否受民衆擁護？這些問題，在國民然歷史中似乎還找不出肯定的答案，尤其是國民黨員，尤其是高級黨員，對於黨之信仰如何，是否忠實地為主義服務，我們認為更成疑間，那末，國民黨領導作用，也就連帶的成為疑問了。</p>
<p>依照目前情勢，國民政府是必須強化的，同時，必須貢獻力是於大東亞戰爭，以期從速爭取勝利。而強化國民政府尤其是完遂大東亞戰爭的先決問題，這是中國人民的期待，同時也是盟邦的期待。然則，如何強化國民政府呢？首先促成政府與人民結合起來，這又是中國人民的期待，同時也是盟邦的期待。怎樣才可促成政府奧人民結合？每日新聞社評主張強化國民黨，並從訓練黨員，然後組縱民衆開始。可是國民黨成立多年，耶訓練黨員一事，尚未成就，遑論維織民衆，如再期待訓練黨員，以強化國府，試問期至何日？更非目前迫切情勢所允許。所以，我們主張卻與每日新聞適得其反，與其強化國民黨，不如強化「中國人民」，與其訓練黨員，不如直接訓練民衆，而訓練責任不必期之於黨，使黨之組織範圍更小，而由政府直接擔負，並由民意機關協助之，比較切實有效。強化國民政府是目的，強化「國民黨「與強化」中國人民是方法，方法雖有兩個，而目的仍是一個。我們主張的理由已如上述，孰近孰遠，有待明擇。至於如何強化「中國人民」，最要者莫如設立民意機構，使人民有參與政治之機會，從而訓練，從而與政府結合，最易收效。我們前已論列再四，於此不　。</p>
<p>第三次全經委會今日在首都舉行　由汪委員長親自主持會議</p>
<p>南京十四日中央社電國民政府全國經濟委員會以自中日同盟條約簽訂，暨大東亞宣言發表之後，我國今後經濟政策之推行實施，有共同研討計劃之必要。爰定於今（十五）日在首都舉行第三次全體委員會議。各地委員除少數因故請假外，餘均來京參加。收到提案共十餘件。會議於今晨十時開始，由汪委員長親自主特。預定由財　實業建設糧食各部長，及華北政委會工務總署蘇督辦等，報吿工作概況後，員始討論各項提案。於今後經濟政策之推行實施。有所商決，其意義至為重大。</p>
<h3>第二方面軍　作戰建樹偉勳　激戰四晝夜仍堅守陣地</h3>
<p>開封十四日中央社電孫良誠將軍所部第二方面軍，前會與優勢共匪邀戰四書　，直至最後仍能堅守陣地，建樹偉勳。茲錄該軍剿共血戰記如次</p>
<p>緣客歲十一月中旬，冀魯邊區共產軍，因感食糧不足，乃企圖掠奪和平地區之物資，並奪回過去喪失之地盤，即陸續開始侵人孫良誠軍之駐防地區。並有八千共匪大舉進犯。第二方面軍第百四十八團守備之徐鎮（河南缑陽東南），該團長狄國華上一校，當即決意</p>
<p>死守陣地</p>
<p>李少數部下，猛激邀擊。敵恃其勢衆，而將徐竊元全包圍。狄團長惟恐一般民房為共匪利用，作為攻擊第一方面軍之　壘，乃將民房完全拆毀，即與共匪展開猛烈攻防戰。如斯激戰通宵，　共匪之攻勢更形熾烈。第百八十四團則巧妙防守，致仍未發生動搖。及翌日，該　援盡糧絕，終陷危善謀，即命令部下以大鍋煎油煮水，思以此衝澆敵人。未幾，果有共匪來襲城塞，第百四十八國全體將士，乃於狄團長指揮下，自城上將沸油及水注於共匪頭上。共匪</p>
<p>遭此奇襲</p>
<p>忽呈大混亂，紛紛潰走。其後復兩三次逼近該鎮，第四十八團軍乃以投石投滾不戰法，將其擊退。共匪愛創甚組，如此激戰三書夜。至第三日夜半，共匪始行後退，但仍未解重團。副團長再命部隊乘黑夜偷襲敵軍。放火焚燒共匪　食及燃料等。一時敵營大亂，火勢　天。第二方面軍將兵即持　棒等　人敵陣，　開重圍，向東南潰走。狄團長率全軍將兵，以寡敵衆，奮戰結果，終將共匪擊退，實堪為中國武人之垂範，故各方面對之，無不異當稱讚云。</p>
<h3>張司法部長昨由滬抵京</h3>

<p>譯評</p>
<h3>期望於南京首腦部</h3>
<p>入新春以後，南京首腦部即着手切實整頓並強化國民黨，雖不無時機已失之憾，但為補半之計，猶未為連。國民黨的強化如能迅速實現，則國府木身固易於滋長發展，而對於大東亞戰爭，也必有偉大貢獻，可說是很好的一件事。</p>
<p>南京的國民黨，於六年前國民政府還都南京之前即已復活，國府成立時，且為其母體，盡了很大的仟務。但一旦國府成立後，黨首腦部及中　份子，大多入掌要職，於是，國民黨立即變成無「實」的「果皮」，棄置一旁。從此以後，國民黨的存在，實已徒有其名，以迄於今。國民黨在復活以後，就遭遇到這樣的不幸，因之無暇整頓其組織，伸展其勢力。遂形成今日黨勢的極度不振，一般人甚至對於黨的存在，也表示懷疑。然而，國府首腦部，以國民黨棄置一旁而不顧者，決不是出於本意。蓋國府地位的強化與發展，對於黨組織的整頓擴大，很明顯地是必要的可是，為當時國府內部複雜微妙的情勢所擊制支配，遂被迫棄置。我們不問其理由如何，其結果，使國府的發展，因此而遭過困難。於是國內外有識之士，惄焉憂之，熱烈希望國府首腦部強化國民黨，使國府趨於發展。而時至今日，國府目腦部終於未能賓　強化黨的舉措。</p>
<p>國民黨的強化，何以在國府的強化上，及其對戰爭的貢獻上是必要的呢？這從國府與黨，以及與一般民衆的關係上以觀，其理由即易明白。有人說中國民衆大概都存「利己」觀念的，全體的存在，猶如一盤散沙。因此，如不築合民衆組織起來，則國府絕對不能伸展其政治力量，行使其政令。如果國府的政令不行，則戰意的昂揭，生產的增強，自不可能。因而對戰爭不能有所貢獻。然則，國府本身能否組織民衆呢？這是不可能的。因為尚缺少指揮如意的手足，以及強有力的組織力量。那末，誰可以担任這個任務呢？可以設是國民黨。國民黨是國府的母優，是基礎，同時又是手足。深入民衆，可以組織民衆，使國府的政治力滲入到民衆組織裹面，同時，把國府與民衆牢固地結合起來，防止國府離開一般民衆。這是國民黨的使命及任務。所以國民黨仍如目前現象，棄置一旁，抑止其活動，則國府不能在民衆之聞植立基石，其強化發展，自亦不能成功。顧府雖已有了完整的機講與整齊的陣營，還不能完成充分的發展者，最大原因實在於此。</p>
<p>為了國府的發展，國民黨的強化實有其必要。國府首腦部真正要着手黨的強化，不能不傾注全力，迅速究成其目的。整頓並強化各級黨部的組織，充實其質量，全體黨員重施訓練，防止官僚化，這是一般應加注意的。可是。最爭要者當總。裁汪主席應親自指揮黨的强化工作。全體國府　腦部也應該不專顧當前的政務，而盡力擴充黨的勢力，同時，應該以最高的機力賦予國民黨，並供給其充足的經費。非如此決不能護得很多的優秀黨員，不能活潑地展開黨的活動。要之，戰　日趨激烈，國民然的強化也愈見迫切。希望汪主席等首腦部致最大的努力從事於此。（翔：　自自一月四日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>日設立航空工業會實施統一生產體制</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電日軍需省航空兵器總局，為統一管理陸海軍兩航空本部所管事項起見，決定於十五日實施航空兵器統一生產體制。最近會與軍需省作緊密之聯繫積極準備，設立航空工業會，俾使民問方面航空兵器生產者打成一片，聞該會決定於十六日設立。此次新設之航空工業會，係取銷從前陸軍航空工業會及海軍工業會所轄航空部門，適應軍需省之官制而擴充編組者，並為呼應軍電省航空兵器行政一元化，乃極力集結全民間航空兵器生產担當者，以謀航空兵器生產事務之圓滑化及技術之向上。新航空工業會係以工業會為母體，以此等重要產業團體之會長理事長組織參與會，並以機體原動機。電器攻擊兵器。計器光學器材。鐵鋼合金機械。第一化學。第二化學。第三化學。木斜及燃料等十四工會為木部直轄機關，並利用東京名古屋大阪福岡化台札幌新瀉廣島松山等九地方協力會作為協力體，預料該會成立後，日本之航空兵器生產體制富益鼠整備強化，甚對於今後航空兵器之調整增產，定有莫大貢獻，其前途頗堪期待。至總裁一職，決定暫由航空兵器總局長官遠藤三郎陸軍中將担任，副總裁則由準備委員長鄉古潔氏及前任海軍航空股部長片桐英吉中將担任。</p>

<h3>印緬北部日軍前進</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電緬甸前錢日軍某基地訊：印緬北部國境富宮方面之日軍，十日猛攻卡　河之敵軍陣地，即將其佔領。嗣又續行前進，是役敵軍棄屍四十具，被俘及負傷者甚多，日軍並鹵獲步槍十三支，彈藥一千六百餘發及其他軍火甚多。</p>
<h3>日本年度實行大量增稅　鞏固戰時財政基礎</h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　値此大東亞戰爭巳屆决戰階級，日政府為鞏固財政基礎，加强消費限制，以資吸收浮動之購買力起見，決於昭和十九年度斷然實行大量增稅，即以直接稅為主，以問接稅為從。去年十二月廿一日之閣談中，曾決定提交此次議會之增稅案要網，邇來大藏省當局即積極整備細目，茲已竣事，故於十一日之閣議中討議決定所得稅法等廿九件之改正法案，大藏省於十二日下午發表。關於直接稅，如所得稅·法人稅·特別法人稅。臨時利得稅·股利特別。稅通行稅、家產稅，臨時租稅·措置法等十七件中，改正部分之稅率及增收額表。此次日政府實行增稅，其唯一目的在增加稅收，故對租稅系統不加何等　更，例如所得稅增收五成等，旨在提高稅率，與此併行並謀課稅之充實，更對納稅及繳稅手續加以徹底檢討，實行多方面之改革。然此次雖提高稅率，而基礎減稅額及扶義家族減稅額等仍無變更，且設置丙種事業所得稅，故預料當可增加百萬人以上之納稅人數。直接稅關係十一稅目提高稅率後之稅收增加預算額，昭和十九年度　定為十四　六千三百萬元，昭和二十年度為十九億九千二萬元，此若與十九年度之本預算額沘算，則昭和十九年度直接稅關係之稅收，即為七十六億六千四百萬元，昭和二十年度為七十八億九千三百萬元。又視繳稅方法之改革等實效如何，明年庭自可有相當額之增牧，衆料直接稅關係或可實收八十億元。</p>

<h3>戰時德國後方生活　婦女加入生產陣容</h3>
<p>職工為國寶</p>
<p>在娛樂方而，對勞慟者農民自一週前起即已預定座位，　使免費閱覽，在休假日則連袂赴保養地休息。在派洛晚地方，每夏舉行有名的　格納音樂會，但現在　全祗供勞慟者，農民欣賞·很多勞動者，農民以希特勒的客人的資格至派洛脫地方玩賞。德國的勞慟者在自己的工作上足以自誇。因為工資高，不想轉任別的職業。此種情事在德國的生產方面很有影響，對德國的生產力能夠安心者也就在這裹。「職工是德國之寶」。此外，雖另有許多外人勞慟者在工作着，也並無不安的情狀。</p>
<p>某飛機工廠中，外人勞者也有占百分之六七十者，但能率並不低下，成績極為良好。這可說是歷史上空前的可驚　的事實。德國民衆在德國的勝利上有着確信，同志之間的互愛極為　固，這和前次大戰中公然在議會上發表反戰演設的德國完全不同其面目。</p>
<p>歐洲要塞安固</p>
<p>歐洲要寒眞是所謂銅牆鐵壁。萬一英美大軍要在歐洲大陸上登陸一步，殲滅的準備已吿完成，靜待英美軍怎樣前來攻擎。</p>
<p>那祇要看反軸心軍的登陸義國也可以知進。在南義加泰尼亞。以赫爾曼戈林的一個師團抵阻英美的大軍。</p>
<p>德軍對英美軍有着絕對的自信，如西西里的撤退，完全撤退得不清一兵，道事實敵方也承認的。德軍在法國，匈牙利的兵力出乎意外地有力，歐洲要塞已措於磐石之安。</p>
<p>前曾隨大島大使視察法西海岸的德要塞，縱使落下了一噸炸彈，也不致毀損其　，其堅固堪驚嘆。在要寨裹，即使有空，兵士們也可以安心睡覺，且也可以照常工作。　　敵人屢次空襲的結果，德國民衆的敵愾心愈為強固，如魯爾地方，人心　都　起了擊滅英美的鬥志。法國·波蘭·荷蘭·此利時等德占領國，密切協力德國的遂行戰爭，巴爾　諸國的協力亦然，祇有巴黎和以前沒有大的差別，和德國女子比較起來，巴黎女性悠閑自在。</p>
<p>沒有小姐階級</p>
<p>德國的女子勞慟者，可說比男子勞動者更多。從「斯達林格勒悲劇」起，德國女子到一切工廠中去工作。不做寫宇間工作，都變成工廠勞動者擔任逐行戰爭的事務。酒吧間女郎因酒店停閉而從事工廠勞慟者，電車軍掌，郵差等。且作這樣勞慟的年輕女子們，有着在完遂戰爭上有所貢獻的自覺故意志極為明朗堅定。家庭的主婦無子女者前往勞慟，有子女者也視家庭的情形而服役勞務。小姐階級從德國完全被掃除了，雖沒有娘子軍，但也有所謂普利茲·梅蒂思（雷擊女）者，着起了漂亮的制服，進出於占領地，在軍事事務精神抖擻地服務。德國的女子們之間，排斥口紅，女子活動在各方面非常觸目。</p>
<p>德國的娛樂，在滅輕戰時下的重負的意義上，不作一切戰爭物。國民融合在戰爭中生活着，所以戰爭物是不必要的。這是德國的娛樂指導的根本方針。大衆娛樂愈見強化，啤酒店也照常開設，有一馬克二馬克就可以買啤酒，馬鈴薯，蔬菜且飲且食。戲劇，音樂，演奏，電影盛行，如前所述（K.D.D.F.歡喜力行團）為勞勸者，農民預定座位，電影，演奏會在戰時下因有更進一步陶冶品性的必要，所以大多取材於古典物。</p>
<p>感激日本戰果</p>
<p>德國的娛樂情形，是說明德國安然從事戰爭的最好例子。日本電影也在德國放映。有一張「馬」的影片，很淸楚地介紹了日本人的眞面且，博得非常的好評。德國國民的日本觀，是理想化，神格化了的日本。日本的大戰果當放在新聞的顯着地位。最近如波根維爾島的大戰果，使德國民衆大為興奮，報紙的論說上也寫了日本所想說的東西。（完）（翔：譯自十二月三十日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>節約協會之所能</h3>
<p>「節用而愛人」，「國奢則示之以儉」這一類的中國古話，實最適用於今日的經濟上海，上海是全國奢糜風尚的領導者，平時已覺此風之不可長，戰時更覺有積極取締之必耍。今年是推行增產運動的一年；增產運動的一方面是開源，而其另一方面，則為節流，（節約電流，即其一例）；倘然一面生產，一面消耗，其結果便等於不生產；所以節約是增加生產的一個最大助力。</p>
<p>節約固然可以由政府強制執行，但若由民間經濟界的領袖，身為表率，多方倡導，其潛移，默化之功，甚至在強制執行之上。因此，我們對於上海特別市節約協會的期待，是十分熱烈的。該會旣有我國領袖人物充任理事，復有盟邦知名之士，為其顧問，其組織之健全，自可不言而喻。</p>
<p>該會一昨通過關於提倡公務員與市民之節約宴會送禮及遵守時問一個要案，我們認為是切合目前需要的，因為農歷新年在邇，大家又要忙於宴會送禮，殊與戰時節約消費之旨相矛盾。果然必須要講人情的話，年禮何不改為賀年片？春酒何不改為一桌茶？至於遵守時間，乃所以節約電力之消耗，因為節省陽光，正是為着節省燈光，晚間宴會，果不能免，亦須遵時，否則燈光是耍處擲的。凡此種種，既均為節約協會之所能提倡，是當盡其所能，以為其他一切節約行動之倡導。</p>
<h3>華股起伏轉狹　多數股仍疲莫能興</h3>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>立志（五）</p>
<p>到了三年級的時候，眞人的成續，是二百三十一人中的十六名。而他的年齡也恰是十六歲。</p>
<p>「那麼，來年可不要降到十七名啊！」哥哥四吉，這樣說着笑话。</p>
<p>但是到了十六歲，已經不能說是少年了。依照古例，已經要加冠東帶，列入弱冠的。眞人也改製了嗓音，同時對自已的將來，也深刻地思考起來了。</p>
<p>（月薪生活，無論如何是不合自己個性的……）他開始想着那種事。但那也不過是一種自嘲而已。說眞心話，實在因爲不顧意一出中學就過薪水生活。</p>
<p>那時候，谷的家裏，長女次女都已嫁了，長男眞藏也已帶了妻子進京，所以母親也透過一口氣來。店的買賣也很興隆。十六歲的少年，不會不感這樣一個家庭的豐裕的。（我也要進高一級的學校……）同級的朋友都志聲高級的學校，不喜歡唯有自己留在這鄕下。即使家境已經比從前好的多，但是不願獨自一人，耗費巨多的學費，去受所謂高等的敎育。才其是對孩子們的待遇，公正無私的母親，恐怕是不會許可的。那麽自有官費的學校，高等师範學校，從心裏也不喜歡。</p>
<p>（做軍人好吧。陸軍學校呢？海軍學校呢。！）像算術的答案似的，將來志望軍人的目的是已經決定了。陸軍好呢？海軍好呢？那只好等今後再研究。總而言之，自己要做軍人。不然，一定要做軍人，這個決必，是不會變更的，倘然陸軍士官學校，海軍兵學校，都考不上的時候，只有徵兵入伍後，　期後仍然留在隊裏罷」！</p>
<p>他旣然這樣決心後，是從入第二中學以來胸中的鬰氣，一旦開朗。用功的目標也確立了，自己得意的代數和幾何，也加倍的勉勵起來了。對物理歷史和語學，也感到興趣。不得意的日語漢文，也感覺容易了。但是，眞人這種決心，連對母親也沒表明。總覺說不出口來。因爲再等一個時期再談也不爲晚。</p>
<p>連對母親都沒表明，所以隆夫和小森自然更不能談起的。在他們中間，總以爲眞人在二中畢業後，一定要做銀行職員。但是眞人用功的方法，確是特別不同。的天裏無論誰來打夥玩兒，他一定是答應同去的。在母校的八幡小學，同朋友們打球角力等等的玩着。但是到了夜裏，就要潛到屋脊上四疊半的小室裏，不顧老鼠打架的聲音，集中精神於復習和預習。他這種用功的方法，也是不令外人知道的。</p>

<h3>Strengthening the Kuomintang or Strengthening the People</h3>
<p>—One Goal, Two Methods—</p>
<p>A Japanese Mainichi Shimbun editorial, recently titled "Expectations for the Nanjing Leadership" (translation appeared in today's paper on the first page), discusses the necessity and urgency of strengthening the Kuomintang. Its conclusion is roughly that the Kuomintang can organize the people, enabling the National Government to connect with the masses. If this strengthening can be quickly realized, the National Government will be easier to develop, and it will make a very significant contribution to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>It is widely known that the Kuomintang is the parent organization of the National Government, and that the National Government arose from the Kuomintang. It is also widely known that the leading figures of the Kuomintang all participate in the government, holding high-ranking official positions. However, because the Kuomintang's leading figures are mostly in politics, as the Mainichi Shimbun editorial says, the Kuomintang has become a "fruit peel" without "substance," existing in name only. We believe that if we want to strengthen the Kuomintang, we must first strengthen the outstanding members who lead the Kuomintang and engage in party affairs. Any political party must have a comprehensive political program and policies. The target of the so-called political program and policies is not the interests of the party members, but the entire interests of the people. Therefore, the party's political program and policies will be understood by the people and will be supported by the people. Only such a party can strengthen itself and play a leading role.</p>
<p>Based on the above arguments, the Kuomintang historically has been the parent organization of the National Government, with a long history, millions of members, clear principles, and a complete political program. However, in reality, what is the understanding and belief of party members in the party? Are they faithfully serving the principles? Even if the political program is set for the entire interests of the people, are the executors faithful? Are they making it understood by the people? Is it supported by the people? These questions do not seem to have definitive answers in the history of the Kuomintang, especially regarding the faith of Kuomintang members, especially high-ranking party members, in the party and whether they faithfully serve the principles. We believe this is even more questionable, so the leading role of the Kuomintang is also questionable.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the National Government must be strengthened, and at the same time, it must contribute to the Greater East Asia War in order to strive for victory as soon as possible. Strengthening the National Government is a prerequisite for completing the Greater East Asia War. This is the expectation of the Chinese people and the expectation of the Allied nations. So, how do we strengthen the National Government? First, promote the combination of the government and the people. This is also the expectation of the Chinese people and the expectation of the Allied nations. How can we promote the combination of government and the people? The Mainichi Shimbun editorial advocates strengthening the Kuomintang, starting with training party members and then organizing the masses. However, the Kuomintang has been established for many years, and the training of party members has not yet been achieved, let alone organizing the masses. If we expect to strengthen the National Government by training party members, when will that be? It is not allowed by the current urgent situation. Therefore, we advocate the opposite of the Mainichi Shimbun: instead of strengthening the Kuomintang, it is better to strengthen the "Chinese people"; instead of training party members, it is better to directly train the masses. The training responsibility does not have to be borne by the party, making the party's organizational scope smaller, and it should be directly borne by the government and assisted by public opinion organs, which is more practical and effective. Strengthening the National Government is the goal, and strengthening the "Kuomintang" and strengthening the "Chinese people" are the methods. Although there are two methods, the goal is still one. The reasons for our advocacy are as described above. Which is near and which is far remains to be seen. As for how to strengthen the "Chinese people," the most important thing is to establish public opinion institutions, so that the people have the opportunity to participate in politics, thereby training them and combining them with the government, which is easiest to achieve. We have already discussed this repeatedly, so we will not repeat it here.</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session of the National Economic Council Was Held in the Capital Today; Chairman Wang Personally Presided Over the Meeting</p>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The National Economic Council of the National Government, in view of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Declaration, deemed it necessary to jointly discuss and plan the implementation of China's future economic policies. It was decided to hold the Third Plenary Committee Meeting in the capital today (the 15th). With the exception of a small number of committee members from various regions who requested leave due to circumstances, the rest came to Nanjing to participate. More than ten proposals were received. The meeting began at 10 a.m. this morning, personally presided over by Chairman Wang. It is expected that the ministers of finance, industry, construction, and food, as well as the director of the Engineering Bureau of the North China Political Affairs Commission, Superintendent Su, and others will report on the general situation of their work, and then members will begin discussing various proposals. Decisions will be made regarding the implementation of future economic policies, which is of great significance.</p>
<h3>The Second Route Army Achieves Great Achievements in Combat and Heroically Defends Its Position After Four Days and Nights of Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Second Route Army under General Sun Liangcheng previously fought bravely with numerically superior Communist bandits for four days and nights, and was able to hold its position until the end, achieving great achievements. A record of the army's heroic anti-Communist battles is as follows:</p>
<p>In mid-November of last year, the Communist army in the border area of Hebei and Shandong, feeling a shortage of food, attempted to plunder supplies from peaceful areas and regain lost territory, and successively began to invade the garrison area of Sun Liangcheng's army. Eight thousand Communist bandits launched a large-scale attack. The 148th Regiment of the Second Route Army, guarding Xuzhen (southeast of Gouyang, Henan), immediately resolved to defend the position to the death.</p>
<p>Colonel Di Guohua, the regimental commander, with a small number of his subordinates, launched a fierce counterattack. The enemy, relying on its numerical superiority, completely surrounded Xuzhen. Regimental Commander Di, fearing that ordinary civilian houses would be used by the Communist bandits as bulwarks for attacking the First Route Army, completely demolished the civilian houses and launched a fierce offensive and defensive battle with the Communist bandits. The fierce battle lasted all night, and the Communist bandits' offensive became even more fierce. The 184th Regiment skillfully defended, so it did not waver. By the next day, the battalion was exhausted of aid and food, and was in dire straits. He ordered his subordinates to boil oil and water in large pots, thinking of using this to pour on the enemy. Before long, Communist bandits came to attack the city. All the officers and men of the 148th Regiment, under the command of Regimental Commander Di, poured boiling oil and water on the heads of the Communist bandits from the city. The Communist bandits, encountering this surprise attack, suddenly became chaotic and fled. Afterward, they approached the town two or three times, and the 48th Regiment used the method of throwing stones and rolling logs to repel them. The Communist bandits suffered greatly. The fierce battle lasted three days and nights. On the night of the third day, the Communist bandits began to retreat, but they still did not lift the siege. The deputy regimental commander ordered the troops to sneak attack the enemy in the dark, setting fire to the Communist bandits' grain and fuel. For a time, the enemy camp was in chaos, and the fire blazed into the sky. The soldiers of the Second Route Army, holding clubs and other weapons, charged into the enemy's formation, breaking the siege and fleeing to the southeast. Regimental Commander Di led the entire army to fight against the overwhelming enemy, and in the end, defeated the Communist bandits. He is truly a model for Chinese soldiers, and all sides praised him.</p>

<p>Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>Expectations for the Nanjing Leadership</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of the New Year, the Nanjing leadership has begun to earnestly reorganize and strengthen the Kuomintang. Although it is not without regret that the opportunity has been missed, it is not too late to make amends. If the strengthening of the Kuomintang can be realized quickly, the National Government itself will easily grow and develop, and it will certainly make a great contribution to the Greater East Asia War, which can be said to be a very good thing.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Kuomintang was revived six years ago, before the National Government moved its capital back to Nanjing. When the National Government was established, it was its parent organization and made a great contribution. However, once the National Government was established, most of the party's leaders and middle-level members took important positions, and the Kuomintang immediately became a "fruit peel" without "substance," discarded to one side. From then on, the existence of the Kuomintang was only in name until now. The Kuomintang encountered such misfortune after its revival, so it had no time to reorganize its organization and extend its influence. As a result, the party's strength is extremely weak today, and people even express doubt about the party's existence. However, the leaders of the National Government did not intentionally abandon the Kuomintang. Clearly, strengthening and developing the National Government's position required the reorganization and expansion of the party organization. However, it was forced to abandon it due to the complex and subtle situation within the National Government at the time. We do not ask the reason, but the result is that the development of the National Government has suffered difficulties as a result. Therefore, knowledgeable people at home and abroad are deeply concerned and earnestly hope that the National Government's leadership will strengthen the Kuomintang and enable the National Government to develop. And today, the National Government's leadership has finally taken measures to strengthen the party.</p>
<p>Why is the strengthening of the Kuomintang necessary for the strengthening of the National Government and its contribution to the war? This is easy to understand from the relationship between the National Government, the party, and the general public. Some say that most Chinese people have a "selfish" concept, and the existence of the whole is like a pile of loose sand. Therefore, if the public is not organized, the National Government can never extend its political power and implement its decrees. If the National Government's decrees are not implemented, then it will be impossible to boost morale for the war or increase production. Therefore, it cannot contribute to the war. So, can the National Government itself organize the public? This is impossible. Because it still lacks obedient hands and feet, and a strong organizational force. So, who can take on this task? It can be said to be the Kuomintang. The Kuomintang is the mother of the National Government, its foundation, and also its hands and feet. Going deep into the public can organize the public, allowing the political power of the National Government to penetrate into the public organization, and at the same time, firmly uniting the National Government with the public, preventing the National Government from leaving the general public. This is the mission and task of the Kuomintang. Therefore, if the Kuomintang remains as it is now, abandoned to one side, and its activities are suppressed, then the National Government cannot establish a foundation among the public, and its strengthening and development cannot succeed. The reason why the National Government has complete mechanisms and an orderly lineup, but still cannot achieve full development, is mainly due to this.</p>
<p>For the development of the National Government, the strengthening of the Kuomintang is necessary. If the National Government's leadership truly wants to start strengthening the party, it must devote all its efforts to quickly achieve its goal. Reorganizing and strengthening the organizations of party departments at all levels, enriching their quality, retraining all party members, and preventing bureaucratization are things that should be paid attention to. However, the most important thing is that Chairman Wang should personally direct the party's strengthening work. The entire National Government leadership should also not only focus on current government affairs, but also strive to expand the party's influence. At the same time, it should give the Kuomintang the highest authority and provide it with sufficient funds. Otherwise, it will never be able to attract many outstanding party members and cannot vigorously carry out party activities. In short, as the war becomes increasingly fierce, the strengthening of the National Government is becoming more and more urgent. It is hoped that Chairman Wang and other leaders will make the greatest efforts to this end. (From the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, January 4th)</p>

<h3>Japan Establishes Aviation Industry Association to Implement Unified Production System</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Aviation Weapons Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions has decided to implement a unified production system for aviation weapons on the 15th in order to manage matters under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy Aviation Headquarters. Recently, it has been actively preparing in close contact with the Ministry of Munitions to establish an Aviation Industry Association, so that civilian aviation weapons manufacturers can become one. It is reported that the association will be established on the 16th. The newly established Aviation Industry Association will abolish the aviation departments under the former Army Aviation Industry Association and Navy Industry Association, expand its organization to adapt to the official system of the Ministry of Munitions, and in response to the unification of aviation weapons administration by the Ministry of Munitions, it will strive to gather all civilian aviation weapons manufacturers to smooth the aviation weapons production business and improve technology. The new Aviation Industry Association takes the industry association as its parent body, with the chairmen and directors of these important industrial groups organizing a participation committee. Fourteen industrial associations such as airframes, prime movers, electrical appliances, attack weapons, instruments and optical materials, iron and steel alloys, machinery, first chemicals, second chemicals, third chemicals, wood and fuel are directly under the headquarters, and nine local cooperation associations such as Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka, Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Sapporo, Niigata, Hiroshima, and Matsuyama are used as cooperative bodies. It is expected that after the establishment of the association, Japan's aviation weapons production system will be better prepared and strengthened, and it will definitely make a great contribution to the adjustment and increase in production of aviation weapons in the future, and its future is quite promising. As for the position of president, it has been decided that Lieutenant General Saburo Endo, Director of the Aviation Weapons Bureau, will temporarily serve as the president. Mr. Kiyoshi Kyogu, chairman of the preparation committee, and Lieutenant General Eikichi Katagiri, former chief of the Navy Aviation Division, will serve as vice presidents.</p>

<h3>Japan Implements Large-Scale Tax Increases This Year to Consolidate Wartime Financial Base</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - At a time when the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, the Japanese government, in order to consolidate its financial base, strengthen consumption restrictions, and absorb floating purchasing power, has decided to implement large-scale tax increases in fiscal year Showa 19, mainly direct taxes and secondary indirect taxes. In the cabinet meeting on December 21st last year, it was decided to submit the outline of the tax increase bill to this Diet. Since then, the Ministry of Finance has actively prepared the details, and has now completed them. Therefore, the cabinet meeting on the 11th discussed and decided on the amended bills of 29 items, such as the Income Tax Law. The Ministry of Finance announced on the afternoon of the 12th the tax rates and increased revenue table of the amended parts in 17 items of direct taxes, such as income tax, corporate tax, special corporate tax, temporary profit tax, dividend special tax, passage tax, property tax, temporary tax, and special tax measures law. The only purpose of the Japanese government's tax increase this time is to increase tax revenue, so no changes will be made to the tax system. For example, increasing income tax by 50% aims to increase tax rates. At the same time, efforts will be made to improve taxation, and tax payment and payment procedures will be thoroughly reviewed to implement multi-faceted reforms. However, although tax rates have been increased this time, there will be no changes to basic tax deductions and dependent family tax deductions, and a Type C business income tax will be established. It is expected that the number of taxpayers will increase by more than one million. The estimated increase in tax revenue after the tax rate increase of 11 direct tax items is set at 1.463 billion yuan in fiscal year Showa 19 and 1.992 billion yuan in fiscal year Showa 20. If this is compared with the original budget amount of fiscal year 19, the tax revenue related to direct taxes in fiscal year Showa 19 will be 7.664 billion yuan, and in fiscal year Showa 20 will be 7.893 billion yuan. In addition, depending on the actual effect of the reform of tax payment methods, a considerable amount of increase in tax revenue can be expected next year. It is expected that direct tax revenue may actually reach 8 billion yuan.</p>

<h3>Wartime German Rear Area Life - Women Join the Production Ranks</h3>
<p>Workers are National Treasures</p>
<p>In terms of entertainment, seats have been reserved for laborers and farmers since a week ago, allowing them free access, and they go to resorts for rest on holidays. In Bayreuth, the famous Wagner concerts are held every summer, but now they are exclusively for laborers and farmers to enjoy. Many laborers and farmers visit Bayreuth as guests of Hitler. German laborers can be proud of their work because wages are high, and they do not want to switch to other professions. This situation has a great impact on German production, and the confidence in Germany's productivity lies here. "Workers are Germany's treasures." In addition, although there are many foreign laborers working, there is no sense of unease.</p>
<p>In a certain aircraft factory, foreign laborers account for 60-70%, but their efficiency is not low and their performance is excellent. This can be said to be an unprecedented and astonishing fact in history. The German people have confidence in Germany's victory, and the mutual love between comrades is extremely solid. This is completely different from the Germany of the previous World War, where anti-war speeches were openly made in parliament.</p>
<p>Fortress Europe is Secure</p>
<p>Fortress Europe is truly a so-called iron wall. If the British and American armies were to land even a step on the European continent, preparations for annihilation have been completed, awaiting to see how the British and American armies will come to attack.</p>
<p>That only needs to be seen from the Allied forces' landing in Italy. In Catania, Southern Italy, a division of Hermann Göring is resisting the British and American armies.</p>
<p>The German army has absolute confidence against the British and American armies. The retreat from Sicily, completely withdrawing without losing a single soldier, is a fact that the enemy also acknowledges. The German forces in France and Hungary are unexpectedly powerful, and Fortress Europe is firmly established.</p>
<p>Previously, having inspected the German fortresses on the French Atlantic coast with Ambassador Oshima, even if a one-ton bomb were to fall, it would not damage them, and their sturdiness is astonishing. Inside the fortresses, even if there is an air raid, soldiers can sleep peacefully, and can continue to work as usual. As a result of repeated enemy air raids, the German people's animosity towards the enemy has become stronger. In the Ruhr region, people have been aroused to fight to destroy Britain and America. France, Poland, Holland, Belgium, and other German-occupied countries are closely cooperating with Germany in carrying out the war, and the cooperation of the Baltic states is also the same. Only Paris is not much different from before. Compared with German women, Parisian women are leisurely and carefree.</p>
<p>No Miss Class</p>
<p>German female laborers can be said to be more numerous than male laborers. Since the "Stalingrad tragedy," German women have gone to work in all factories. Not doing office work, they have become factory laborers engaged in the affairs of the war. Barmaids have become factory laborers due to the closure of bars, and there are tram conductors, postmen, etc. Moreover, these young women who do such labor have a clear and firm determination to contribute to the completion of the war. Housewives without children go to labor, and those with children also serve according to the situation of their families. The miss class has been completely swept away from Germany. Although there is no women's army, there are so-called Blitzmädel (lightning girls), wearing beautiful uniforms, entering and exiting the occupied territories, spiritedly serving in military affairs. Among German women, lipstick is rejected, and women's activities are very conspicuous in all aspects.</p>
<p>German entertainment, in the sense of alleviating the heavy burden of wartime, does not involve any war themes. The people are integrated into life in the war, so war themes are unnecessary. This is the fundamental policy of German entertainment guidance. Mass entertainment has been strengthened, and beer halls are still open. One or two marks can buy beer, potatoes, and vegetables to eat and drink. Drama, music, performances, and movies are prevalent. As mentioned earlier, the Kraft durch Freude (Strength Through Joy) organization reserves seats for laborers and farmers. In wartime, movies and performances are necessary to further cultivate character, so most are based on classical works.</p>
<p>Grateful for Japanese War Achievements</p>
<p>The state of German entertainment is the best example to illustrate that Germany is peacefully engaged in war. Japanese movies are also shown in Germany. One movie, "Horse," clearly introduced the true face of the Japanese people and won high praise. The German people's view of Japan is an idealized and deified Japan. Japan's great war achievements should be placed in prominent positions in the news. Recently, the great victory on Bougainville Island greatly excited the German people, and newspaper commentaries also wrote what Japan wanted to say.

<h3>Air Defense Headquarters Notifies Citizens to Pay Attention to Air Raid Drills Demonstrating the Dropping of Dummy Bombs</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) According to an announcement yesterday from the Shanghai Special City Civilian Air Defense Headquarters: During the city's upcoming air defense drills, simulated enemy aircraft will demonstrate the dropping of dummy bombs. At that time, neighborhood security personnel or self-defense group members, upon encountering these dummy bombs or other rocket-like objects falling within their assigned area, should immediately report the facts to the responsible police precinct without delay.</p>

<h3>Special Consumption Tax to be Levied in Fifteen Cities and Counties Starting Tomorrow; Other Regions to Determine Dates Separately</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) The Ministry of Finance has specified that the special taxes on retail goods and banquets and hotels will be levied starting from the (16th). The third item, the special tax on entertainment consumption, will be enforced later on a date to be determined by the ministry. According to reports, the regions where this wartime special consumption tax will be collected include the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Except for the No. 1 and No. 8 districts of Shanghai Special City, which will still be levied by the Finance Offices of the No. 1 and No. 8 District Public Offices, the special taxes in other counties and cities will be directly supervised by the Tax Affairs Administration, which will instruct local regional tax bureaus to handle the collection of special taxes in accordance with the tax rates and regulations. The funds collected by the No. 1 and No. 8 districts will be remitted to the Tax Affairs Administration and turned over to the national treasury. It is heard that the Tax Affairs Administration, because the opening of this special tax is a new tax policy, asked about areas that could not be handled in time, so it first designated Shanghai, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Changshu, and Yangzhou in Jiangsu, and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Shaoxing in Zhejiang, and Wuhu and Bengbu in Anhui, a total of fifteen important cities and counties, to be levied starting on the 16th. Other less important areas will have their opening dates determined separately.</p>

<h3>Dock Traveler Service Center Handles Worker Registration Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dock Traveler Service Center, sponsored by the Chinese Social Welfare Association, in view of the fact that Shanghai is an important commercial port in China, with very busy shipping traffic, and travelers coming and going, is often plagued by gangsters occupying, extorting, and deceiving at various wharf docks. The center has obtained approval from the Ministry of Social Welfare, the Shanghai Special City Government, and Allied police agencies to register all dock workers in the city starting today, so as to issue badges with numbers for identification and work permits. The registration office is now located at No. 202 Jiujiang Road, 3rd Floor, Room 301.</p>

<p>The dock situation in Shanghai is complex and has been plagued by malpractices for a long time. How to achieve the ideal goal requires the support of all sectors of society in order to promote its completion.</p>
<p>City Government Protection</p>
<p>The service center, in view of the heavy task of rectifying dock work, and in order to prevent unscrupulous elements from inciting or obstructing the work, has submitted a request to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau to forward to the Municipal Government for approval for protection in order to facilitate the work.

<h3>New Measures for Purchasing Overshoes</h3>
<p>Must First Prepare a Letter of Application</p>
<p>The Bureau of Standards and Measurements, in view of the lack of rubber sources and in order to suppress prices and effectively implement price limits, specially issued an order to all rubber overshoe factories in the city last year to strictly limit the selling price of overshoes and stipulate that they be exchanged for house tax receipts and old overshoes. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter, the Greater China Rubber Factory recently considered the methods stipulated by the authorities to be somewhat lacking in perfection, so they specially suggested to the authorities that another method be established for citizens to purchase. In the future, if citizens wish to purchase overshoes, they must first prepare a letter to apply to the rubber factory, stating their address, house tax receipt number, and the style and size of the old overshoes they are prepared to exchange. After the rubber factory notifies the date, they can go to purchase with their citizen certificate and house tax receipt. All original retail stores will temporarily suspend business from today.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>What the Thrift Association Can Do</h3>
<p>"Practice thrift and love the people," and "If the country is extravagant, show it thrift," these kinds of ancient Chinese sayings are most applicable to today's economic Shanghai. Shanghai is the leader in the country's extravagant customs. We usually feel that this trend cannot be sustained for long, and during wartime, we feel even more that it is necessary to actively ban it. This year is the year for promoting the production increase movement; one aspect of the production increase movement is to increase income, and the other aspect is to reduce expenditure (saving electricity is one example); if we produce on one hand and consume on the other, the result is the same as not producing; therefore, thrift is the greatest help to increasing production.</p>
<p>Thrift can of course be enforced by the government, but if the leaders of the economic community take the lead and advocate in many ways, its subtle and silent effect is even above the forced execution. Therefore, our expectations for the Shanghai Special City Thrift Association are very enthusiastic. The association has leading figures from our country as directors, and well-known figures from Allied countries as advisors, so the soundness of its organization is self-evident.</p>
<p>The association passed an important proposal yesterday regarding promoting thrift in banquets, gift-giving, and punctuality among civil servants and citizens. We believe it is in line with current needs, because the Lunar New Year is approaching, and everyone will be busy with banquets and gift-giving, which contradicts the purpose of wartime thrift and consumption. If it is really necessary to talk about human relationships, why not change the New Year's gift to a New Year's card? Why not change the spring wine to a pot of tea? As for punctuality, it is to save electricity consumption, because saving sunlight is precisely for saving lighting. If evening banquets cannot be avoided, they must also be punctual, otherwise the lighting is thrown away unnecessarily. All of these can be advocated by the Thrift Association, and it should do its best to advocate other thrift actions.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in Chinese Stocks Narrow; Most Stocks Remain Weak and Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks were mediocre throughout the day. As the Lunar New Year approached, investment was constrained by the money supply, and there were people looking high on the red market. Sellers were also unwilling to sell cheaply, resulting in sparse transactions. Until the final closing, more stocks in various industries fell than rose, with no major fluctuations. In the department store industry, Xinxin and Guohuo both rose slightly. Wing On Company leveled out. In the textile industry, Wing On Yarn Factory leveled out with a small loss of 2.5 yuan, but it recovered by the end of the session, and there was also demand without supply. The silk industry returned to within 500 yuan, and Meya and others also rose slightly. Only Zhenfeng and Innerwear rose slightly. Cultural stocks were the flattest. The new pharmaceutical industry was weak and unable to rise. Zhongxi Minyi hovered. In the chemical industry, Greater China Match alone rose by 10 yuan, and Mingxing was firm. Real estate stocks reported being unsustainable again. Datong Business suddenly rose by 3 yuan, and Jiu'an and Sanle, Liya and others continued to decline. Others such as Kangyuan Canning tended to be firm at the late closing. Most of the rest leveled out with small losses. The late closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>The Sixth Session of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Decides on Strict Selection; Ning Kuiqi and Zhu Nei Yi Companies Each Donate Ten Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to limited funds and an overwhelming number of applications for our newspaper's sixth reader scholarship fund, and considering the current amount of deposits, we fear that it will not be sufficient to allocate funds. Therefore, it has been decided to strictly screen this year's applicants, adhering strictly to the criteria of "impoverished and academically excellent," with no exceptions for those who do not meet the standards.</p>
<p>Ning Kuiqi's Owner Acts Selflessly</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from the owner of Ning Kuiqi, expressing deep sympathy for the increasing number of impoverished students applying for scholarships. They generously donated ten thousand yuan in national currency to support education, a gesture of great admiration and respect.</p>
<p>Zhong Guo Nei Yi Company Offers Bonus for Scholarship</p>
<p>This newspaper continues to request that individuals from the city's business sector allocate some of their year-end profits to donate to education. While the donation may be easy for the donors, it greatly benefits the recipients. Yesterday, Zhong Guo Nei Yi Company took the lead in responding, allocating a bonus of ten thousand yuan to donate to the scholarship fund. The company's leadership in philanthropy is admirable and respectable. We hope that leaders in the business community will follow suit in their benevolence and actively contribute, which would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Avoid Extravagance During the New Year, Donate Feast Expenses</p>
<p>It has become a trend for most enthusiastic individuals to advocate for saving on feast expenses during the Lunar New Year's Eve dinner and donating the funds to scholarships, which is commendable. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wu Deqing stating, "At the end of the Lunar New Year, there is a custom of holding a 'New Year's Eve' feast. However, given the high cost of living, with a single meal costing thousands of gold, it is unnecessary to indulge in such extravagance. Therefore, I am donating the equivalent of five thousand yuan in cash to your newspaper's scholarship fund, enclosed with this letter."

<h3>Price Control Bureau Investigates Major Commodity Associations</h3>
<p>Preliminary Improvement of Commodity Allocation in Various Industries</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Price Control Bureau of the Ministry of Industries instructed various industry associations to investigate the general situation of industry associations in various regions, as well as the production location, production status, allocation management authorities, allocation methods, and allocation quantities of the nineteen major commodities and cement under the bureau's management in the Shanghai area. The bureau also prepared investigation tables for completion. According to reporters, the competent authorities believe that there is a need to improve the commodity allocation methods in various industries and are actively seeking solutions. However, the first step is to investigate the general situation of major commodity industry associations and the sources of materials obtained by industry members in the past, as well as the names of the awarding agencies and the monthly allocation quantities. Once this information is collected, it will be categorized and consolidated to prevent evasion and promote universality.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Aspiration (5)</p>
<p>When he was in the third grade, Masato's grade was sixteenth out of two hundred and thirty-one. And his age was exactly sixteen years old.</p>
<p>"Well, don't drop to seventeenth place next year!" his brother Yoshibei said with a laugh.</p>
<p>But at sixteen, he could no longer be called a boy. According to ancient customs, he had to be crowned and wear a sash, entering into manhood. Masato also changed his voice and began to think deeply about his future.</p>
<p>(A salaried life is not in line with my personality...) He began to think about such things. But that was just a self-mockery. To be honest, he really didn't want to live on a salary immediately after graduating from middle school.</p>
<p>At that time, in the Tani's family, the eldest daughter and second daughter were already married, and the eldest son Masazo had also taken his wife to the capital, so the mother could breathe a sigh of relief. The store business was also booming. A sixteen-year-old boy could not help but feel the abundance of such a family. (I want to go to a higher-level school...) Friends in the same grade all aspired to higher-level schools, and he didn't want to be the only one left in this rural area. Even though his family was much better off than before, he didn't want to spend a huge amount of tuition on so-called higher education alone. Especially since his mother, who treated her children fairly, probably wouldn't allow it. Then, the tuition-free schools, the higher normal schools, were not to his liking.</p>
<p>(Becoming a soldier would be good. The army school? The naval academy.!) Like an answer to an arithmetic problem, his goal of becoming a soldier had already been decided. The army or the navy? That would have to wait for future research. In short, he would become a soldier. Otherwise, he must become a soldier. This determination would not change. If he couldn't get into the army officer school or the naval academy, he would only enlist as a conscript and remain in the army after the term!</p>
<p>Once he made up his mind, the depression in his heart since entering the Second Middle School was suddenly cleared. The goal of studying diligently was also established. He doubled his efforts in his favorite algebra and geometry. He also became interested in physics, history, and languages. He also felt that the Japanese language and Chinese writing that he was not good at became easier. However, Masato's determination was not even revealed to his mother. He always felt that he couldn't say it out loud. Because it wouldn't be too late to talk about it later.</p>
<p>Since he didn't even reveal it to his mother, Takashi and Komori naturally couldn't talk about it. Among them, they always thought that Masato would become a bank clerk after graduating from the Second Middle School. But Masato's method of studying was indeed particularly different. No matter who came to play on weekends, he would definitely agree to go with them. At his alma mater, Yawata Elementary School, he would play ball games and wrestle with his friends. But at night, he would sneak into the small four-and-a-half-tatami room on the roof and concentrate on reviewing and previewing, regardless of the sound of rats fighting. He also did not let others know about his method of studying.</p>
