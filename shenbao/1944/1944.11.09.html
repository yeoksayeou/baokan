<h3 id="c7">不妥協 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>日本小磯首相於上月三十日，在大阪國民代表大會演講各方戰爭勝利情况，闡發政府決心，鼓勵國民努力（見十月三十一日本報），共最要點乃是「不妥協」三字。小磯首相說：「我人當前應努力之目標，唯有獲取決戰之勝利，且其中更無絲毫妥協之餘地，企圖中途與敵人妥協者，不晏痴人說夢。正義及人道之論，唯有待最後勝利獲得後，始能與敵人聲述」。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是經過長時期的忍耐，長時期的考慮，被迫而不得不發動的。我們回想那時候日本駐美大使野村和來柄兩氏的委曲折衝，忍辱負重，一直就想用道義來維持國際間的友誼，不料美國政府處處以私利爲前提，以欺詐爲手段，驕慢的氣燄，更是旁若無人，抱着壓迫東亞民族的野心，絕不容許東亞民族的獨立和自由。美國政府處心積盧要東亞民族永久做英美的奴隸，自然更談不到正義和平等。這是東亞民族生死存亡的樞紐，若要謀取生存，除了戰爭以外，沒有第二條路可走。大東亞戰爭是在「忍無可忍」的情緒下發動的，是被壓迫民族向侵略民族的反抗，是被迫的自然趨勢，好比十字軍的高舉義旗，所以自從日本領導起來以後，整個東亞民族，全體響應，十億東亞民族在共同的目標之下，爲整個民族奮鬥，因爲不如是，東亞各個國家民族必淪於滅亡，那是毫無疑義的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭是在被壓迫的環境下自然生的，大東亞戰爭的目標，就在人壓迫中求解放，從不自由不平等中求自由和平等。所以在民族解放尚未完成，自由平等尚未獲得之前，戰爭狀能亦自然地只有愈趨愈烈的繼續着。同時因爲東亞的民族的解放，就等於呌英美敵人放棄他們過去以榨取欺騙手段所取得的利益，凡是以壓迫行爲所取得的利益都要歸還於（東亞民族，這在自私自利的英美敵人，自亦必用死力來掙扎。侵略主義是英美的傳統主張，近百年來的歷史更足爲這種野心的事實證明。根深蒂固的主義，若不受最嚴重的敎訓，自然不容易消滅。貪得無厭的野心，若不受最大的打擊，更不能够激底遏止。正如德富蘇峯所說：「要打，打，打到敵人五體投地，東亞民族然後方能出頭」。</p>
<p>戰爭已到決戰階段，勝利基礎已經奠定，東亞的戰事更將到達最高峯，敵人必定要傾全國之師，作孤注之一擲，失敗是已注定了的，但是不給敵人以最大的失敗，決不能使敵人覺悟。大東亞民族的勝利亦是注定的了，但是大東亞民族一定還要用十二分的力量，堅定主張，不妥協，不驕，不餒，沉着氣，增進後方的國力，充實前方的接濟，等待着最後的機會，實施我們準備元全的最後一擊。小磯首相說：「政府已有堅持非獲得最後勝利不止之決心，亦望國民諸君始終爲政府後盾，至獲得最後勝利之目的而後已」。這是每一個東亞國民都應該時常記在心頭的。</p>

<p>南京八日中央社電國府爲期地方軍政一元化，此次再度調整地方軍政機構，設　駐蘇洲綏靖主任公署，任命作援道爲江蘇省長兼駐蘇綏靖主任，至此各省省長均已兼任所在地綏靖主任，如湖北省長楊揆一兼駐武漢綏靖主任，江西省長高冠吾兼九江綏靖主任，淮海省長郝鵬舉兼駐徐州綏靖主任，安徽省長羅君强兼駐蚌埠綏靖主任，浙江省長項致莊兼駐杭州綏靖主任，廣東省長陳春圃兼駐廣州綏靖主任，而駐蘇北綏靖公署主任孫良誠，亦兼理民政，特於綏署設置政務廳。中央又令各省保安處裁撤，改設全省保安司令部，由省長兼任保安司令，各行政督察專員兼任區保安司令，各縣縣長兼任保安隊長。經此調整，地方軍政已完全一元化，地方軍政運營更臻完善。</p>
<p>回溯本年元旦主席訓詞中，明示今年努力之指標，爲（一）肅正思想，（二）確保治安，（三）增加生產。除思想肅正姑置別論外，確保治安與增加生產方面，尚有待於更大之努力。吾國地居後方，在大東亞戰爭中之主要任務，在集結總力協力戰爭。具體言之，即發揮無限的人力物力，以增强戰力，因此須特別努力於治安之確保，以求生產力之增强，與生產量之增加。過去增產成果，未盡能滿意之原因，實由於地方軍政未盡合作，彼此不免有隔閡之處，從而地方治安未能鞏固，影醫生產之進行。舉例言之，如鄉間匪共猖獗，農民不能安居樂業，農產品爲匪共所乎掠奪，各地貪汚之風盛行，關卡林立，苛捐雜稅層層剝削，民不聊生，工商業首受打擊，經濟乃軼出常軌。試問生產旣受阻滯，維持現况猶所不能，遑論增加生產。考治安之所以未能鞏固，首在軍政分歧，彼此牽掣，不能斷然掃除積弊，因之阻碍民生，馴至社會秩序紊亂，匪徒橫行，善良　伏，終於百業凋零，生產停滯，中央有鑒於此，爲集結總力協力大東亞戰爭，完遂後方增產之任務，乃調整地方軍政機構，確立地方軍政之一元運營。因此今後各地治安之確保與生產之增加，至堪期待。國人於此更應各出全力，協力政府推進施政，以期能獲得軍政一元運營之最大成果。</p>

<p>南京八日中央社電國府最高經濟顧問小倉正怛氏，自七月問歸闕後，已於本月五日返抵南京。八日六時特接見中國新聞記者團，就歸閱期間一般觀感及對記者國叩詢各點，發表談話如次：「本人此次歸國，爲期四月左右，始於最近返華。歸國時，適逢寒班戰事激烈之秋，日本－般民心極爲緊張，到七月十三日塞班島全體將士玉碎消息傳來，全國沉悶空氣爲之一新，感覺戰爭之完邃，必歷盡重貢困難而後始可達成。適屈此時日本內閣改組，全國民心乃益形振奮，一掃過去之懷疑態度，而講求各種具體協力方策，過去每由政府發動者，今則改由國民自動策進，政府人民打成一片，全團上下精神極爲明朗。臺彎菲鳥捷報傳來，全國民氣更爲昻揚歡騰，然其中並無稍有懈怠，各人咸知此時非亨樂時期，亟應共舉全力推進生產，以境强戰力完遂戰爭。決戰及總力嚴之呼聲，已早傳於吾人之口，然其眞意殆至最近始由民衆了解，各方皆能積極推進生產，諾如學生工人等無一不理解時局之重大性，而北舉全力邁巡增產，軍官民間一　掃過去之種種隔膜，而互相協力推進結果，各方生產成績皆極爲優良。例如食米問題，看日本國民而色之壯健，即可暸解其狀況如何。新內關施策中最有成效老，當推指導輿論，政府與人民間極爲融洽，政府無一事不可示人民，而人民之愛國心亦皆任其自由發展，故國中充滿一片和樂氣象。</p>
<p>對華觀念顯著變更</p>
<p>對華間譴，國丙民衆之觀念有顯著玫愛，自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，日本國民之視綫多集中於南方，而對華觀念則仍不如中日事變當初之情形！直至最近始知大陸戰終與南方戰綫，乃統一之戰綫。在大東亞共策國之建設中，中國乃日本最好之兵站基地，其人口之衆多，土地之廣大，與南洋華僑之潛勢力等，皆爲大東亞建設中不可或缺之條件，而一掃過去之誤解，尤其自塞班事件發生以來，日本國民惑覺對華之經濟協力，有採取具體方法之必要。此種觀念之改變，實爲中日間所應共賀者也。關於中國近况，日本國民多以爲自大睦戰綫着著進展以來，國專治下之經濟狀况，當益趨良好，雖然此不能如想懺之順利，但本人確具決心，務協力中國使經濟前逮日趨光明，四月問本人曾言根據對華新政策，推進中國經濟，今後當仍本此方針勞力作去答覆記者問</p>
<p>繼由小倉顧問就記者所詢各點答復如下：</p>
<p>（問）泱戰體制下貴國經濟統制施策，已收訓期效果，其足資吾國統制經濟對策上之敘考者必多，請問其特點加與？（答）其特點雖多，重要者當爲行政力之澈底，行政力澈底而後統制始易收效。</p>
<p>米煤問題最爲重要</p>
<p>（問）目前中國統制經濟施策未蘇完善，以致物價仍不斷狂漲，對此問題吾人深望盟邦方面能予以有力之協力，請問顯閒之意見如何？（答）此於戰時下乃爲一最重大之問題，目下疋由有關方面積極鼾究對策中．物便中富以米煤二項最爲重要，米煤問題能獲解決，其他當亦不成問題。煤的方面最近由於有關當局之努力，已逐漸好轉，米的方面由於米統會之努力進行，此後當可鬨滿解決。（問）統制經濟之目的，在求確保軍需安定民生，此二者直接問接對完遂戰爭，均有深切關係，故不宜偏倚，而且前以民生日趨艱困，故深盼寫局對圾需能加以進一步之改善，閣下之意見如何？（答）由新木主任顧問答，茲爲謀光遂戰爭，吾人對物質之需求，自不能不稍事忍耐，惟自安定民生觀之，則吾人願以下列之點，爲今後推進改善之方針，（一）關簽通賞，（二）增强運输力，（三）發抓勞動力，惟此種推遷．不僅是政府之努力，更需民族之協力，深盼言論界立於民衆指導者之地拉予以協力，傅使官民一體共同完成戰時經濟之重任</p>
<p>物價高漲如何挽救</p>
<p>（問）關於物價高涨之原因不外二端，一为物资問題，一爲通貨問題，屬於物資問題者，祇須疏暢來源，增加生產，不難解決，屬於通貨方面者，則求幣値之穩定，穩定幣値一點，請發表高見？（答）關於通貨問題，此亦須有政府與人民共同協力，始可解決，目下華中通行之貨幣乃中儲券，非中儲行之通貨而爲全民衆之通貨，故應由全體民衆予以愛護，尤其關於通貨信用之增加，深望全體民間金融機關予以協力。最近中儲行推進之統制金融，其目的即在於此，此事並望言論界多予援助，使民衆咸知維持貨幣之信用，乃每人應有之義務，勿使資金流往無益之處。（問）穩定幣制安定金融工作，周有待金融機關本身之自肅與協力，然現金融機關業務範圍至爲狹小，或除投機囤積之外，別無業務投資經營，蓋如投資工業生產，則原料缺乏動力不足，如投機農業生產，則農村治安尙未確立，故皆有待於政計政治力之强固，關於此點，顧問之意見如何？（答）統制金融之目的，即在籌引資金用入正途，不使流爲風積，關於農業之發展，並非僅爲資金問題，其他人力物資皆與此有關，相互並行而後始能收效，工業發展問題，方才小倉最高顧問題已說過，煤之來源已農漸好轉，來日是之發展當可預卜，關於農業問題，目下不般農民最感苦痛者，當爲利息之鍵貼擔，故如待導引游資走入農村，農村狀態自可好轉，惟治安問題自爲應予重視之一點，第三問以下，均由新木主任顧問答。</p>

<h3 id="c19">王蔭泰與華北食糧問題 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>王克敏，王蔭泰和汪時璟，是被稱爲藥北三巨頭，他們今日在實際上掌握了華北的運命。記者對王克敏和注待璟二氏，均曾爲文介紹於讀者，因此乃特於十月十六日下午前往農務總署訪問王蔭泰氏。後者乃華北政界最忙碌的要人，他一身兼有數職：總務長官，內務廳長，農務總署督辦以汝華北食糧公社理事長。他在少年時代曾在日德二國留學，在日本曾卒業於東京第一高導學校，在德國六年會卒業於柏林火學。據他說，他先是讀的法律，後來研究政治經濟。所以在今日華北政界中，要找出這樣一位有才學的人，是很不易的。</p>
<p>春風滿面抱負遠大</p>
<p>記者此次特往訪問工氏的目的，不僅爲了他是一個要人或巨頭之故，而是因爲華北的民生和他卻有密切的關係。儘管華北各市府的糧食管理屬諸經濟局，可是華北政委會總的糧政卻屬於農務總署。所以，記者爲了要明瞭華北現階段的糧政推行，不得不前往與工氏一談．當託者說明來意之後，王氏即首先點頸說；「關於登北的一般經濟情形，可以說沒有一個人再比我清楚的了。有的也許祗知道一部份，可是我卻知道其全部的情形。﹂於此可見王氏是怎樣地一位坦白的人，同時他滔滔不絕的談鋒也是値得一個初見者的驚賞的。看上去王氏也許已是五十開外的人了，可是他納心情卻是和壯年時代一般。他是一位和雲可親釣人，和他在一起談話，眞是好像接着春風的－般。記者很相俗他曾有許多的抱負，或者只是環境阻抑着她的幹才。說句老實話，華北的現狀如果以任何一位中閱的政治家來說的話，只要有華中，的環境恐雜政治還要好一些！可惜他們想幹而沒法幹的一羣，正好像、－位美人有邐暮之感</p>
<p>集中全力减少人民痛苦</p>
<p>王氏是原籍紹典，卻在蘇州生長，自外國　來後即在北京政府時代，活躍，直到國府成立始退隱。退隱後曾長期在滬，所以和上海也有很深的關係，尤其他在上海的朋友業很多的。從他的談吐間，深深地可以領略到他是位富有風趣的人物。然而他是一位肯幹而有幹的辦法的人，雖然時代和環境曾限制了他的發展。他和我說，他在事變的時候就在上海，和梁衆異先生甚爲知交，那時梁氐即曾邀其出負維新政府的艱　，可是他鍳於時局動亂未已乃思退隱故都。不料臨時政府的首腦王叔魯先生也是他的知交，迫於友誼乃終於担任了實業部的職務。自臨時政府到華北政委會，他始終掌捏了賞業建設的大權，直到去歲政委會改級，王叔魯先生東山再起，始改任今職。</p>
<p>據王氏說，那時北方的一般政治家所以終於出任臨時政府要職者，賞初目的原在於：（九）希望事變急速終了！（二）減少淪陷地帶人民之　苦·可是自從的戰力，記者深信去歲華北食糧問題嚴叢的情形，或者在南方的人至今也沒有志記，可是今年當記者行抵故都時卻完今像換了一個世界。直到和王民談話之後，才知道即使環境艱雞，只要能夠戰事延長，甚至由於大東亞戰爭之爆發，他們對於第一目的始漸感失望，故今後他們唯有集其全力於第二目的之完成。我們看吧，譬如像王氏，他一年來對華北食糧問題的解決，確是一個頂大的貢獻。這個貢獻不僅使今日華北一般民衆不再受去歲所課﹁混合麵﹂配給的　苦，且對一設後方的計會安定也無彩增進了隨助盟邦決戰努力的話任何事都會解決的。</p>
<p>食糧統制權移交政委會</p>
<p>請到華北的民生，王氏會和我作有數十分鐘的長談。當他參加臨時政府的時候，他當時即感到民生問題的嚴重，因此他曾首先發起組織了一個米煤調節委員會。後來這個委員會撤大組織，同時由實業部忙亂隸於行政委員會，且易名爲物資調節委員會。這個委員會當初所負的使命還僅限於討論的性質，有時也向日方提供意見，直到臨時政行改組爲華北政委會，還是那樣。到未深任政委會委員長的時候，又忙亂組爲物資物價處理委員會，因爲在王揖唐主政時代，另有一個所謂物價處理委員會，因此後來使把它合拼爲一。然而那時的民食問使嚴重起來，雖然煤的問題還比較不感困難，於是王氏便思從一個討論機關過渡到一個執行機關，乃有採銷辦事處的設置，以謀食糧的集中採辦和運銷。不過在飿糧統制權沒有交還於我國行政當局以前，一向食糧的配給是由新民會擔任。到了去年三月，盟邦當局根據我國參戰後的新形勢，乃擬將食糧統制種移交政委會（自去看六月後開始）因此華北政鵿會才結於民生主要物資有管理之權。華北方面深感責任之重大，尤其那時對食糧方面老無把糧。當盟邦氫此意對我國當局說明時，離其移交實行期僅有三月，而大八九等月又適爲青黃不接之期，九月後有新　登塲，因此據王氏說他那時會爲了這個問題再三考慮。結果，他唯有向南北設法求援的一法。</p>
<p>從南方採辦食米大失所望</p>
<p>他於是在去年借着參加國府還都三週紀念的機會赴南京，他便於參見主席時坦白表示求援之意。注主席那時慨然允諾接濟米糧十萬噸，且於宴會席上與周副院長前顧糧長等共同商討。周顧二氏在老慮那時南方食糧的實險情形後，也面允先行設法五萬噸。事後王氏且更於訪滿之便，獲滿當局之援助，允予接濟食糧，此事滿以爲可以得到一個圓滿解決，不料後來又爲了金融的關係，華北按那時的實情論，僅能對外洗出一萬萬元的資金，因此向南方購買食糧一事遂不得不大受影響。然血即使如此，如果南方龍把所托代購米糧全部繳清，當時因有滿洲國方面的接濟！還是能夠得到暫時解決的。說起來眞是痛心，據土氏稱在共去議六月再往掄京領取米糧時，糧部富局所代購之麵粉固然慣格遠高原定價格，而所購之米卻是碎米。不，不僅是碎米，而且是一半有砂泥的粒子，當時王氏就大爲憤怒，然而對着這種不是人能下肚的米穀除了領受外還有什麼辦法呢？王氏說到這裏，就笑着道：「那降我本有一位舊時部屬在糧部任司長，我就對他說：你們這樣做法，將來一定要遭到意外的處罰吧！」送樣看起來，前糧部部長顧實衡前次長周大文，今日所判的罪恐怕還是太輕吧！去歲華北人民吃混混麵的苦痛，顧周二氏不能辭其咎！且那時一萬萬元（聯幣）付去之後，這筆賬據說始終沒有清理，華北方而所領得之米麵還是很少並沒有足額。</p>
<p>糧政一元化後問題解決</p>
<p>華北的食糧間題，自從盟邦交還其統制機於我國之後，首先爲了上述情形未能使其圓滿解決實爲不幸。然而當時各省市食糧管理局人員因爲沒有經啦，過去實在毫無成績可言。自本年六月食糧公社成立，糧政一元化之後，暫時在華北方面食糧問題始得一妥善之解決。現在每人每月可配給麵粉十斤，據王氏說以後可增加到十五今斤，且可決不再行脫期。現在華九的食糧問題可以分作幾方面來看：首先是收買，這便是以合作社作執行機關，合作社收買之即交於食糧公社由該社負責製粉，運輸與保管，然後遵照各　地之配給數目交於主管機關。食糧公社總會所管轄之區，是限於北京天津靑島三市，各省另有省地方仞社公社。不過所謂製粉與運輸，據說仍由食糧公社交於小麥協會負責，而保管則由平淮倉庫任之。在總會方面有公儲量，地方方面有地方保有量的規定。小麥協會，平準會倉庫與合作社，仍舊是中中協力的機關，可以在執行方面可說頗爲圓滑！</p>
<p>記者那天和王氏談了很久，直到上燈的時候，他還有許多公事待理所以辭出。以後如有機會，或者當再約時希其指敎關於華北的一般經濟問題。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Joint Announcement by Japanese Army and Navy Ministries: Appointment of Commanders for the Philippine Area, Concurrent Announcement of Air Force Commanders <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army Ministry announced on the 8th: General Tomoyuki Yamashita has been appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines. Lieutenant General Kyoji Tominaga has been appointed as the Commander of the Army Air Force in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on the 8th: Vice Admiral Denchichi Okochi has been appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Naval Forces in the Philippines. Vice Admiral Shigeru Fukudome and Vice Admiral Takijiro Onishi have been appointed as the Commanders of the Naval Air Bases in the same area.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The battle situation in the Philippines, centered on Leyte, is becoming increasingly intense, with decisive battles unfolding day and night. The Japanese Army Ministry also announced on the 8th that General Tomoyuki Yamashita, the valiant commander who swiftly captured Singapore, has been appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Army in the Philippines, and Lieutenant General Kyoji Tominaga, the former Vice Minister of the Army, has been appointed as the Commander of the Army Air Force. The Japanese Army's line-up in the Philippines, where the fate of the Pacific is being gambled, is clearly led by the calm and bold General Yamashita, who has become one of the leading military figures. The Japanese people's trust and admiration for the general have been firmly established since his distinguished service in capturing Singapore. The nation has great confidence in the general's appearance on the front lines in the Philippines, and the morale of the soldiers under his direct command will be greatly boosted. Furthermore, Lieutenant General Tominaga is a typical military commander with strong fighting spirit and strategic vision. The Japanese air force is determined to fight with a spirit of sacrificing one plane for one ship. This spirit of selfless dedication has already emerged on the battlefield. The enemy Americans have deployed five divisions of superior forces on Leyte Island, and are expanding airfields to seize air control over the Philippines, ensuring their rear supply lines, and striving for a favorable position in the decisive battle in the Philippines. At the same time, they have combined the remnants of the 7th and 3rd Fleets, forming a powerful mobile unit with a dozen battleships and aircraft carriers, which is operating in the eastern waters of the Philippines. However, the Japanese soldiers in the Philippines are consistently adhering to their duty, using their strong fighting power to crush the enemy's ambition, inspiring a belief in certain victory, and completely burying every invading enemy soldier in the eastern waters of the Philippines. Our final victory is not far off.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Air Force Continues Relentless Bombing of Enemy Airfields on Morotai and Leyte Islands; Over 300 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Two Weeks <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 8th: The Japanese Air Force attacked enemy airfields on Morotai Island and various enemy airfields on Leyte Island at dawn on the 6th and on the night of the 6th, achieving the following results: (1) In the Morotai Island area, over twenty enemy heavy aircraft were bombed, caught fire, and burned. Several enemy facilities were bombed and exploded, and six caught fire and burned. Subsequently, most of the airfield area was obscured by flames, preventing confirmation of other battle results. (2) In the Leyte Island area, forty-seven enemy aircraft were bombed, caught fire, burned, or were destroyed. Over ten enemy facilities were bombed and caught fire, including two that exploded. (3) Three Japanese aircraft did not return.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Under the command of Air Force Commander Tominaga, the Japanese Air Force is cooperating with the Japanese ground forces day and night, engaging in a desperate struggle to seize air supremacy, which is crucial for determining the outcome of the battle in the Philippines. In the Leyte Island area, in addition to intercepting attacking enemies, they are bombing enemy-occupied airfields in Tacloban, Dulag, and San Pablo, making it difficult for the enemy to use them. At the same time, in order to prevent the enemy from using the two intermediate base airfields in the Philippines and advance Philippine operations, they are continuing bombing of Morotai Island. At dawn on the 3rd, several enemy facilities were set on fire, and one large fire broke out. Following this, the airfield was bombed again at dawn on the 6th, causing one facility to explode, and the explosion affected six other facilities, causing them to explode and burn. The flames rose hundreds of meters. The extensive fire nearly turned most of the airfield into rubble, and the battle results could not be confirmed. On the 4th, the Japanese Air Force bombed the Tacloban airfield four times, setting eighteen facilities on fire and shooting down seven enemy aircraft. On the night of the 5th, they bombed the enemy airfield again, setting six facilities on fire. On the night of the 6th, they bombed the Dulag airfield, setting over ten facilities on fire and causing five explosions, destroying twenty-five enemy aircraft. They also conducted ultra-low-altitude bombing, destroying twenty enemy aircraft. In these battles, three Japanese aircraft did not return. During this fierce air battle in the Philippines, from October 24th to November 6th, the Japanese Air Force accumulated a total of 74 enemy aircraft shot down, 251 enemy aircraft damaged or destroyed, totaling over 325 aircraft.</p>
<p>Manila, 8th (Central News Agency) - On the evening of the 5th, the Japanese Air Force attacked an enemy transport convoy anchored near Tacloban, hitting three ships, one of which was destroyed.</p>

<p>Manila, 8th (Central News Agency) - The American forces, reconnoitering Japanese air bases, launched successive attacks on the Bacolor area with a hundred B-24, B-25, P-38, and P-51 aircraft from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 8th. The Japanese Air Force immediately rose to intercept, resulting in fierce air battles, shooting down five P-38 aircraft, five B-24 aircraft, and two P-51 aircraft, totaling twelve aircraft. Manila, 8th (Central News Agency) - Enemy aircraft carriers carrying many land-based aircraft have been continuously attacking various parts of the Philippines in recent days. On the 7th, the number of aircraft was greatly reduced, with only thirty aircraft attacking the Visayas region.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Battles Around the Philippines Key to Deciding Victory or Defeat; Japanese Prime Minister's Talk with Reporters <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The decisive battles around the Philippines are a major turning point in determining the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War. At 2:00 PM on the 8th, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso met with a group of reporters and made a statement, the gist of which was: "The great decisive battle that our compatriots have imagined has been unfolding since mid-October with the naval battles around Taiwan and the Philippines. Thanks to the protection of the divine spirits of the Imperial Family and the brave fighting of our loyal soldiers, we have achieved unprecedented victories. Now, the enemy British and Americans, with their powerful equipment and strong forces, have invaded Leyte Gulf and launched a landing operation in the sea south of Tacloban. Their strength is five divisions, and fierce battles have begun there with the defending Japanese forces. As our compatriots know, the fighting in that area has reached its climax. This battle around the Philippines is a key to the victory or defeat of the entire war situation for us. We are confident that the Japanese army will win, and the people in the rear must naturally move forward with all their strength towards the path of certain victory. Fortunately, the soldiers on the battlefield are able to overcome all difficulties together and launch a major annihilation battle against the enemy. Today is a difficult time for the 100 million people in the rear to exert all their strength and move toward the path of grasping victory."</p>
<h3 id="e5">Philippine Naval Battle Footage Screening Across Japan; Kamikaze Squadron Footage Also to be Shown <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Newsreel footage of the Philippine naval battle and the actual situation of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force's sortie is about to be screened throughout Japan. The film, Japanese Newsreel No. 232, was filmed at the cost of their lives by members of the Navy's reporting team and special correspondents from Nihon Eiga-sha. It captures the actual situation of the great naval and air battle in the Philippine Sea, including the Japanese fleet launching and stirring up raging waves, the large formations of Japanese naval aircraft successively launching from the ships after discovering the enemy mobile units, the fierce Japanese fire when enemy aircraft invaded the airspace above the Japanese fleet, and the enemy's giant aircraft spewing black smoke and crashing into the sea. It also includes beautiful scenes of friendly aircraft fighting to the last drop of fuel and landing in the sea, and the launching of rescue boats. Even more moving is the actual situation of Commander Seki, the leader of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force, and his five brave warriors departing, with the entire base sending them off. It is truly a magnificent and moving best newsreel.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The actual situation of the great naval battle between the Japanese and American forces in the Philippine Sea, with the Japanese naval fleet triumphantly returning, will be shown in cinemas across Japan starting today. The release of this actual situation filming will greatly undermine America's false propaganda to the world. The film starts with the Japanese naval fleet's departure, followed by the discovery of enemy ships, mutual attacks, the unfolding of air and artillery battles between the two forces, and the gradual escalation of the war to its climax, ending with the Japanese fleet achieving great results and returning triumphantly to its original base, closing amidst tension and excitement. In particular, the scenes of enemy aircraft attacking the Japanese fleet being successively shot down and falling into the water, as well as the wounded Japanese aircraft returning to the aircraft carrier and being rescued upon landing, and the repairs being carried out quickly on the catapult deck after being hit, are extremely moving. Especially the scene where the entire fleet maintains its magnificent appearance and successively returns triumphantly to its original base, even while repairing damaged ships during the return journey, leaves a deep impression on the audience. The Japanese naval fleet has now used facts to completely debunk the enemy American's exaggerated official reports.</p>

<h3 id="e7">No Compromise <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Koiso delivered a speech at the Osaka National Representatives Conference on the 30th of last month, outlining the victorious situation of the war on all fronts, elaborating on the government's determination, and encouraging the people to work hard (see this newspaper's October 31st edition). The most important point was the three words "no compromise." Prime Minister Koiso said: "The goal we should strive for now is only to obtain the victory in the decisive battle, and there is no room for the slightest compromise. Those who attempt to compromise with the enemy midway are simply daydreaming. Arguments of justice and humanity can only be stated to the enemy after the final victory is achieved."</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War was launched after a long period of patience and consideration, and was compelled and inevitable. We recall the time when Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura and Mr. Lai Bing were making compromises and bearing humiliation, always wanting to maintain international friendship through morality. Unexpectedly, the US government always took private interests as its premise and deception as its means. Its arrogant arrogance was unmatched, holding the ambition to oppress the East Asian people and never allowing the independence and freedom of the East Asian people. The US government was scheming to make the East Asian people slaves of Britain and the United States forever, so there was naturally no talk of justice, peace, and equality. This is the crux of the life and death of the East Asian people. If they want to survive, there is no second way to go besides war. The Greater East Asia War was launched under the emotion of "unbearable," it was the resistance of the oppressed people to the invading people, and it was the natural trend of compulsion, just like the Crusaders raising the banner of righteousness. Therefore, since Japan took the lead, the entire East Asian people responded, and one billion East Asian people fought for the entire nation under a common goal, because if they didn't, the various countries and nations in East Asia would be doomed to perish, which is undoubtedly true.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War was naturally born in an oppressed environment. The goal of the Greater East Asia War is to seek liberation from human oppression and to seek freedom and equality from unfree and unequal conditions. Therefore, before national liberation is completed and freedom and equality are achieved, the state of war will naturally continue to intensify. At the same time, because the liberation of the East Asian people is equivalent to asking the British and American enemies to give up the interests they have acquired in the past through extortion and deception, all the interests acquired through oppressive actions must be returned to the East Asian people. The selfish British and American enemies will naturally struggle with all their might. Aggressionism is the traditional claim of Britain and the United States, and the history of the past hundred years is enough to prove this ambition. Deep-rooted doctrines are naturally not easy to eliminate without the most serious lessons. Insatiable ambitions cannot be fundamentally curbed without the greatest blows. As Tokutomi Soho said: "Fight, fight, fight until the enemy is completely defeated, then the East Asian people will be able to stand up."</p>
<p>The war has reached a decisive stage, the foundation for victory has been laid, and the East Asian war will reach its highest peak. The enemy will definitely use all their strength and take a desperate gamble. Failure is already doomed, but if the enemy is not given the greatest failure, they will never be able to realize. The victory of the Greater East Asian nations is also destined, but the Greater East Asian nations must use all their strength, firmly advocate, no compromise, no pride, no discouragement, calm down, increase the national strength of the rear, replenish the supplies of the front, wait for the final opportunity, and implement our fully prepared final blow. Prime Minister Koiso said: "The government is determined to persist until the final victory is achieved, and it also hopes that the people will always be the government's support, until the goal of achieving the final victory is reached." This is something that every East Asian citizen should always keep in mind.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Monsoon Season in Burma Passes, Fierce Battles on All Fronts; Japanese Army and Air Force in Active Position <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>A Japanese Base on the Burma Front, 8th (Central News Agency) - The decisive air battle on the Burmese front has begun with the passing of the monsoon season. The ground battles are also coordinating with the Philippine invasion operation, and the entire front is actively unfolding. The enemy's general counteroffensive is gradually becoming more serious. The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force Headquarters, in order to regain Mangshi and open the Ledo Road, previously gathered the main force of the 11th Army, four divisions, in Mangshi, and deployed two divisions on the north side of Longling, starting the attack on November 1st. The Japanese forces have formed defensive positions on the Yunnan-Burma Highway between Longling and Mangshi, launching fierce offensive and defensive battles. On the other hand, in coordination with this offensive and defensive battle, the Chongqing-US joint forces have been active in the Myitkyina area of ​​northern Burma since the lower ten days of October. Among them, the newly formed 30th Division has been deployed from Myitkyina to Bhamo, and the 38th Division has moved south from the mountainous area on the China-Burma border on the east side of the Myitkyina-Bhamo highway, reaching the vicinity of Tingmawkyit (fifty kilometers northeast of Bhamo). The Japanese forces are currently launching fierce attacks around the area, inflicting considerable damage. In addition, the British 36th Division, which moved towards Mawlu, on the Myitkyina-Mandalay railway, is also coordinating with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force and the Chongqing-US joint forces to launch an offensive. The Japanese forces immediately advanced, consolidated their positions, and prevented the enemy's advance. The British 5th Division, which was deployed in the central India-Burma border area, has been blocked by the strong defenses of Gangaw. The enemy forces that have advanced to Kaladan in the Akyab area are also being fiercely attacked with surprise and ambush tactics, and they are completely in an active position.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Eastern Zhejiang - In order to strengthen security in Eastern Zhejiang, the Zhejiang Province Security Office has established a special task force in Eastern Zhejiang, led by Chen Wenzheng. The office is located at the old site of the Security Office on Fuqi Street in Ningbo, starting on the 2nd of this month.

<h3 id="e12">Further Adjustment of Local Institutions; Unified Military and Political Operations; Greater Efforts Needed for Security and Production Increase <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - In order to unify local military and political affairs, the National Government has once again adjusted local military and political institutions, establishing the Pacification Director's Office in Suzhou, appointing Zuo Yuandao as the Governor of Jiangsu Province and Pacification Director of Suzhou. Thus, the governors of all provinces have concurrently served as the Pacification Directors in their respective locations, such as Hubei Governor Yang Kuiyi concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Wuhan, Jiangxi Governor Gao Guanwu concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Jiujiang, Huaihai Governor Hao Pengju concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Xuzhou, Anhui Governor Luo Junqiang concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Bengbu, Zhejiang Governor Xiang Zhizhuang concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Hangzhou, and Guangdong Governor Chen Chunpu concurrently serving as the Pacification Director of Guangzhou. Sun Liangcheng, the director of the Pacification Director's Office in Northern Jiangsu, also manages civil affairs, and a political affairs office has been set up in the Pacification Office. The Central Government has also ordered the abolition of the Provincial Security Offices and the establishment of Provincial Security Headquarters, with the governors concurrently serving as the Security Commanders, the administrative inspectors concurrently serving as the District Security Commanders, and the county magistrates concurrently serving as the Security Squad Leaders. After this adjustment, local military and political affairs have been completely unified, and the operation of local military and political affairs is becoming more perfect.</p>
<p>Looking back at the President's New Year's Day address, which clearly indicated the goals for this year's efforts: (1) Purify ideology, (2) Ensure security, and (3) Increase production. Aside from the purification of thought, which is a separate matter, greater efforts are still needed in ensuring security and increasing production. Our country is located in the rear and its main task in the Greater East Asia War is to gather all forces to cooperate with the war. Specifically, it is to exert unlimited human and material resources to enhance combat power. Therefore, special efforts must be made to ensure security in order to increase productivity and increase production volume. The reason why the past production results have not been fully satisfactory is that local military and political affairs have not fully cooperated, and there is inevitably some alienation between them, so that local security has not been consolidated, which affects the progress of medical production. For example, if bandits and communists are rampant in the countryside, farmers cannot live and work in peace, agricultural products are plundered by bandits and communists, corruption is rampant everywhere, checkpoints are everywhere, and exorbitant taxes are levied layer by layer, the people cannot survive, and industry and commerce are the first to be hit, and the economy deviates from the norm. If production is blocked, maintaining the status quo is impossible, let alone increasing production. The reason why security has not been consolidated is primarily due to the division between military and political affairs, which check and balance each other, and cannot decisively eliminate accumulated malpractices, thereby hindering the people's livelihood, leading to social disorder, bandits rampant, and the good are suppressed, and finally all industries are withered and production is stagnated. In view of this, the Central Government, in order to gather all its forces to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War and complete the task of increasing production in the rear, has adjusted the local military and political institutions and established the unified operation of local military and political affairs. Therefore, the security and increase in production in various places in the future are highly anticipated. The people of the country should make every effort to cooperate with the government to promote governance, in order to achieve the greatest results from the unified operation of military and political affairs.</p>

After a short stay, he will return to Beijing and then go to Suzhou to take office. The Central News Agency reporter took advantage of Ren's visit to Shanghai and paid a special visit to his private residence yesterday, and was received and made the following remarks on his aspirations for the future governance of Jiangsu Province: "I am extremely uneasy to be ordered to govern Jiangsu this time. I used to serve as Minister of the Navy and concurrently as Commander-in-Chief of the First Army, and the troops of the First Army were originally stationed in Zhejiang, Anhui and other regions, and were assigned to the Pacification Commissioner's Offices in those regions to share the tasks of security and combat command. It goes without saying that there is no need to say anything about security, but in terms of combat, it can only be successful if personnel, economy, sanitation, and education are perfected. Furthermore, I have been serving as the Minister of the Navy for more than four years, and I have not yet been ordered to leave office, and perhaps I will not be able to take care of both in the future. However, I have always been a member of the Navy, and in terms of spirit, I will still consistently cooperate in the construction of the new Shenguo Navy. As for the administration of Jiangsu Province, I will follow the instructions of the National Government and make plans. First, I will purify local security, and in terms of personnel, I must achieve a clean government. In terms of education, I must strive to improve the level and fully increase funding. As for the Blockade Management Office, I hope that all eight members will cooperate and work hard, and strive to avoid past misunderstandings and comply with the purpose of clearing the countryside and securing the people. The above points are what I hope that after I take office, my subordinates will diligently perform their duties and work with peace of mind, and work diligently and publicly with the greatest sense of responsibility. In this way, not only will malpractices be eliminated, but the efficiency of provincial administration will be improved. In short, the first thing I will do after taking office as the Governor of Jiangsu Province is to follow a clean government, stabilize the people's livelihood, and make the exchange of materials smoother. I deeply hope that the farmers of the province will work hard to increase production and unite the officials and the people to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War."</p>

On Walcheren Island, although the British and Canadian forces attacked with huge manpower and material resources, the progress was very limited. South of the mouth of the Meuse River, the enemy exerted pressure on the German bridgehead, but failed to hinder the German withdrawal operation.</p>

Most of the votes counted so far are from large cities, so there may be some changes in the next few hours. The Democratic Party is confident of victory after receiving reports of absolute support for Roosevelt from the southern states.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Japan's Economic Policies Toward China Aim to Strengthen War Capabilities: Consultant Ogura's Remarks to the Press Corps Yesterday <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ogura Masatane, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, returned to Nanjing on the 5th of this month after returning to Japan in July. At 6 PM on the 8th, he met with the Chinese press corps and gave the following remarks regarding his general impressions during his return to Japan and in response to various questions from the reporters: "I returned to Japan for about four months and recently returned to China. My return to Japan coincided with the intense battles of the Cold Squadrons. The general public in Japan was extremely nervous. When the news of the complete annihilation of all soldiers on Saipan Island on July 13th came, the entire country's gloomy atmosphere was renewed, and they felt that the completion of the war would be achieved only after enduring heavy contributions and difficulties. At this time, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and the morale of the people throughout the country was further boosted, sweeping away the past doubts and discussing various concrete cooperation strategies. In the past, everything was initiated by the government, but now it has been changed to automatic promotion by the people. The government and the people have become one, and the spirit of the entire group is very clear. The good news from Taiwan and the Philippines has further raised the morale and joy of the people throughout the country, but there is no slight slackening among them. Everyone knows that this is not a time for enjoyment and that they should do their best to promote production, in order to strengthen war capabilities and complete the war. The calls for a decisive battle and all-out efforts have long been on our lips, but the true meaning has only recently been understood by the public. All parties can actively promote production. Students, workers, and others all understand the importance of the current situation and are doing their best to increase production. Military officers and civilians have swept away all the past barriers and are cooperating with each other to promote results. The production achievements of all parties are excellent. For example, regarding the rice problem, looking at the strength and health of the Japanese people, you can understand the situation. Among the new cabinet's policies, the most effective is to guide public opinion. The relationship between the government and the people is very harmonious. The government can show everything to the people, and the people's patriotism can be freely developed, so the country is full of a harmonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>Significant Changes in Views on China</p>
<p>Regarding China, there have been significant changes in the views of the Japanese people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the attention of the Japanese people has been focused on the South, and their views on China are not as good as they were at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War! It was only recently that they realized that the mainland war and the southern front are unified fronts. In the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, China is Japan's best logistics base. Its large population, vast land, and the potential influence of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are all indispensable conditions for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and past misunderstandings have been swept away. Especially since the Saipan incident, the Japanese people have felt the need to take concrete measures for economic cooperation with China. This change in concept is something that China and Japan should both congratulate. Regarding the recent situation in China, the Japanese people mostly believe that since the Greater East Asia War has progressed steadily, the economic situation under the rule of the National Government should be getting better and better. Although this cannot be as smooth as we would like, I am determined to cooperate with China to make the economy brighter day by day. Four months ago, I said that we would promote the Chinese economy based on the new China policy, and I will continue to work hard in this direction."</p>
<p>Consultant Ogura then answered the reporters' questions as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Under the wartime system, your country's economic control policies have achieved training effects. There must be many things that can be used as lessons for our country's economic control countermeasures. What are the characteristics? (Answer) Although there are many characteristics, the most important is the thoroughness of administrative power. Only with thorough administrative power can control be effective.</p>
<p>Rice and Coal Issues Are Most Important</p>
<p>(Question) At present, China's economic control policies are not yet perfect, resulting in continuous price increases. We deeply hope that the allied countries can provide strong cooperation on this issue. What are your opinions? (Answer) This is the most important issue during the war. The relevant parties are actively studying countermeasures. Among the goods, rice and coal are the most important. If the rice and coal problems can be solved, other problems will not be a problem. Thanks to the efforts of the relevant authorities, the coal situation has gradually improved. Thanks to the efforts of the Rice Control Association, the rice situation can be solved in the future. (Question) The purpose of economic control is to ensure military needs and stabilize people's livelihood. These two are directly and indirectly related to the completion of the war, so they should not be biased. Moreover, the people's livelihood is becoming increasingly difficult, so we deeply hope that the authorities can further improve the needs of the people. What are your opinions? (Answer) Replied by Chief Consultant Shinoki: In order to seek the completion of the war, we must endure some sacrifices in our demand for materials. However, from the perspective of stabilizing people's livelihood, we are willing to adopt the following points as the guiding principles for future promotion and improvement: (1) Loosening trade restrictions, (2) Increasing transportation capacity, (3) Developing labor force. However, this kind of promotion requires not only the efforts of the government, but also the cooperation of the nation. We deeply hope that the media will stand in the position of guiding the people and provide cooperation, so that officials and civilians can work together to complete the important task of the wartime economy.</p>
<p>How to Save Soaring Prices</p>
<p>(Question) There are only two reasons for rising prices: one is the material problem, and the other is the currency problem. For the material problem, it is not difficult to solve by simply smoothing the source and increasing production. For the currency problem, we need to stabilize the currency value. Please express your views on stabilizing the currency value? (Answer) Regarding the currency problem, this also requires the joint cooperation of the government and the people to solve. At present, the currency circulating in Central China is the Central Reserve Bank note, which is not the currency of the Central Reserve Bank but the currency of the entire people, so it should be cherished by the entire people. Especially regarding the increase of currency credit, we deeply hope that all private financial institutions will cooperate. The purpose of the unified financial management promoted by the Central Reserve Bank recently is precisely this. We also hope that the media will provide more assistance so that the public can know that maintaining the credit of the currency is everyone's obligation and should not allow funds to flow to useless places. (Question) Stabilizing the monetary system and stabilizing financial work still require self-discipline and cooperation from the financial institutions themselves. However, the scope of business of current financial institutions is very narrow. Apart from speculation and hoarding, there are no other business investments and operations. If we invest in industrial production, there is a lack of raw materials and insufficient power. If we invest in agricultural production, the security in rural areas has not yet been established, so everything depends on the strength of political planning and political power. What are the consultant's opinions on this point? (Answer) The purpose of unified financial management is to raise funds and use them for the right purposes, so as not to let them flow into accumulation. The development of agriculture is not just a matter of funds. Other human resources and materials are all related to this. Only by proceeding in parallel can it be effective. Regarding the problem of industrial development, Consultant Ogura has already said that the source of coal has gradually improved, and the development of the future can be predicted. Regarding agricultural issues, the most painful thing for most farmers at present is the high interest burden, so if we wait to guide hot money into rural areas, the rural state will naturally improve. However, the security issue is one that should be given attention. From the third question onwards, all were answered by Chief Consultant Shinoki.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Wang Yintai and the North China Food Problem <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>Wang Kemin, Wang Yintai, and Wang Shijing are called the "Three Giants of North China," and they are actually in control of the fate of North China today. The reporter has already introduced Mr. Wang Kemin and Mr. Wang Shijing to the readers, so on the afternoon of October 16th, I made a special trip to the Agricultural Affairs Office to visit Mr. Wang Yintai. The latter is the busiest important figure in North China politics. He holds several positions: Chief of General Affairs, Director of the Department of Internal Affairs, Superintendent of the Agricultural Affairs Office, and Chairman of the North China Food Public Corporation. He studied in Japan and Germany in his youth. He graduated from Tokyo First Higher School in Japan, and he graduated from Berlin University after six years in Germany. According to him, he first studied law and then studied political economy. Therefore, it is very difficult to find such a talented person in North China politics today.</p>
<p>Full of Smiles and Great Ambitions</p>
<p>The purpose of the reporter's visit to Mr. Wang this time was not only because he was an important figure or giant, but also because the people's livelihood in North China has a close relationship with him. Although the food management of various cities in North China belongs to the Economic Bureau, the overall food policy of the North China Political Affairs Committee belongs to the Agricultural Affairs Office. Therefore, in order to understand the current food policy implementation in North China, the reporter had to go and talk to Mr. Wang. After the reporter explained his intentions, Mr. Wang first nodded and said, "Regarding the general economic situation in North China, it can be said that no one knows it better than me. Some may only know a part, but I know the whole situation." From this, it can be seen what a frank person Mr. Wang is. At the same time, his eloquent conversation is also worthy of admiration from a first-time visitor. Looking at him, Mr. Wang may already be over fifty years old, but his mood is the same as in his prime. He is a kind and approachable person, and talking to him is like feeling the spring breeze. The reporter believes that he once had many ambitions, or that his talent was just being hindered by the environment. To be honest, if any Chinese politician were to talk about the current situation in North China, as long as there is the environment of Central China, the political situation might be even better! It's a pity that the group of people who want to do something but can't are just like a beauty with a feeling of twilight.</p>
<p>Concentrate All Efforts to Reduce People's Suffering</p>
<p>Mr. Wang is originally from Shaoxing, but he grew up in Suzhou. After returning from abroad, he was active in the Beijing government era until the National Government was established and he retired. After retiring, he lived in Shanghai for a long time, so he also has a deep relationship with Shanghai, especially since he has many friends in Shanghai. From his conversation, it can be deeply understood that he is a humorous figure. However, he is a person who is willing to work and has a way of doing things, although the times and environment have limited his development. He told me that he was in Shanghai when the incident happened, and was very close friends with Mr. Liang Hongzhi. At that time, Mr. Liang invited him to take on the difficult task of the Reformed Government, but he thought that the situation was still turbulent and decided to retire to the old capital. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang Shulu, the head of the Provisional Government, was also his close friend, and out of friendship, he finally took on the position of the Ministry of Industry. From the Provisional Government to the North China Political Affairs Committee, he has always held the power of reward and construction, until the Political Affairs Committee was reorganized last year, and Mr. Wang Shulu made a comeback, and he was reassigned to his current position.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Wang, the reason why the northern politicians finally took office in the Provisional Government was originally to: (1) hope that the incident would end quickly! (2) Reduce the suffering of the people in the occupied areas. However, since the war effort, the reporter firmly believes that the severe situation of the North China food problem last year may not have been recorded by people in the South until now, but when the reporter arrived in the old capital this year, it was completely like a changed world. It was only after talking to the people that I realized that even if the environment is difficult, as long as the war is prolonged, even due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have gradually felt disappointed in the first goal, so from now on they can only concentrate all their efforts on the completion of the second goal. Let's see, for example, Mr. Wang, his solution to the North China food problem over the past year is indeed a great contribution. This contribution not only prevents the general public in North China from suffering from the "mixed flour" rations that were taxed last year, but also provides a colorful increase to the stability of the rear, and helps the allied countries to work hard to make any matter resolve the final battle.</p>
<p>Food Control Rights Transferred to the Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>When it comes to the people's livelihood in North China, Mr. Wang had a long conversation with me for dozens of minutes. When he joined the Provisional Government, he immediately felt the seriousness of the people's livelihood problem, so he first initiated the organization of a Rice and Coal Adjustment Committee. Later, this committee was reorganized and transferred from the Ministry of Industry to the Administrative Committee, and renamed the Materials Adjustment Committee. The mission of this committee was initially limited to discussion, and sometimes it also provided opinions to the Japanese side, until the Provisional Government was reorganized into the North China Political Affairs Committee, and it was still the same. When Mr. Wang Yitang served as the Chairman of the Political Affairs Committee, he hastily organized the Materials and Price Handling Committee, because there was another so-called Price Handling Committee during the time of Wang Yitang, so he later merged them into one. However, at that time, the problem of people's food became serious, although the coal problem was not as difficult, so Mr. Wang thought about transitioning from a discussion mechanism to an executive mechanism, and the Purchasing and Sales Office was set up to seek centralized purchasing and sales of food. However, before the right to control food was returned to our administrative authorities, the rationing of food was always handled by the New People's Association. In March of last year, the allied authorities, based on the new situation after our country joined the war, planned to transfer the food control to the Political Affairs Committee (starting from June of last year), so the North China Political Affairs Committee finally had the power to manage the main materials for people's livelihood. North China felt the weight of the responsibility, especially since there was no food stock at that time. When the Allied authorities explained this intention to our country's authorities, there were only three months left until the transfer and implementation period, and August and September were also the period when the old and new crops were not available, and new crops would be harvested after September, so according to Mr. Wang, he considered this issue repeatedly at that time. As a result, he only had one way to seek help from the north and south.</p>
<p>Greatly Disappointed in Purchasing Rice from the South</p>
<p>Therefore, last year, he took the opportunity to participate in the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, and went to Nanjing. He frankly expressed his intention to seek assistance when he met the chairman. Chairman Wang then generously promised to provide 100,000 tons of rice, and discussed it together with Vice President Zhou and former Food Minister at the banquet. After considering the actual situation of food risks in the South at that time, Zhou and Gu also agreed to try to obtain 50,000 tons first. Afterwards, Mr. Wang also took the opportunity to visit Manchuria and obtained assistance from the Manchurian authorities, who agreed to provide food assistance. The matter was thought to have been resolved satisfactorily, but later it was affected by financial relations. Based on the actual situation at that time, North China could only withdraw 100 million yuan of funds abroad, so the purchase of food from the South had to be greatly affected. However, even so, if the South had turned over all the rice that was entrusted to be purchased, and there was assistance from Manchuria at that time! It was still possible to get a temporary solution. Speaking of which is really painful, according to the claim, when Mr. Wang went to Nanjing again in June to receive rice, the flour purchased by the Food Ministry's Office was indeed at a price far higher than the original price, and the rice purchased was broken rice. No, it's not just broken rice, but half of it has sand and mud particles. At that time, Mr. Wang was very angry, but what else could be done except to accept this kind of rice that no one could eat? When Mr. Wang said this, he smiled and said, "Then I had an old subordinate who was a section chief in the Food Ministry, and I said to him: If you do this, you will definitely be punished unexpectedly in the future!" It seems that the crimes of former Food Minister Gu Shiheng and former Vice Minister Zhou Dawen, who were sentenced today, are probably too light! The suffering of the people of North China who ate mixed noodles last year cannot be excused by Gu and Zhou! Moreover, after 100 million yuan (Union currency) was paid at that time, it is said that the account has not been cleared, and the amount of rice and noodles received by the North China side is still very small and not full.</p>
<p>Problem Solved After Food Policy is Unified</p>
<p>The food problem in North China was unfortunate that it could not be resolved satisfactorily from the beginning after the Allied forces returned its control mechanism to our country. However, at that time, the staff of the food administration bureaus in various provinces and cities had no experience, and they had no achievements in the past. Since the establishment of the Food Public Corporation in June of this year, and the unification of food policy, the food problem has been temporarily resolved in North China. Now everyone can be rationed ten pounds of flour per month. According to Mr. Wang, it can be increased to fifteen pounds in the future, and it can be decided that it will not be delayed again. The food problem in North China can be viewed from several aspects: The first is the purchase, which is to use the cooperative as the implementing agency. The cooperative purchases the goods and delivers them to the Food Public Corporation, which is responsible for milling, transporting, and storing them, and then delivers them to the competent authority according to the ration number of each place. The area under the jurisdiction of the General Association of the Food Public Corporation is limited to the three cities of Beijing, Tianjin, and Qingdao. Each province has its own provincial local public corporation. However, it is said that the Food Public Corporation still entrusts the milling and transportation to the Wheat Association, and the storage is handled by the Pingzhun Warehouse. The Wheat Association, the Pingzhun Warehouse, and the Cooperative are still Zhongzhong's cooperation agencies, and it can be said that they are quite smooth in the implementation!</p>
<p>The reporter talked to Mr. Wang for a long time that day, until the lights came on, and he still had many official duties to deal with, so he resigned. If there is an opportunity in the future, I will ask for instructions on the general economic issues of North China.</p>

<p>Respectfully informing you that you are holding a medical aid fund to benefit the poor and sick, and I deeply express my sympathy. I uphold the purpose of a doctor to help the world. For this move, there should be a spirit of mutual assistance. In September, I donated a percentage of my consultation fees to be used as a medical aid fund. It has been a month since then, and I will again extract 10% from my October consultation fees, totaling 1,055 yuan, and hope that it will be allocated to the medical aid fund. I know that a drop in the bucket is of no help, but I hope to use this as a starting point to attract jade, and to do my duty. I also hope that all doctors will respond together, then gathering drops will become a flood, and piling sand will become a tower. The total number must be considerable. Sincerely, Gu Naigang.</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Old People's Home Fundraiser is Approaching its Deadline: Hoping for Enthusiastic Contributions from All Sectors <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Target: 5,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Period: Until November 10th</p>
<p>Collection Point: Social Service Department of this newspaper</p>
<p>The Shanghai Old People's Home fundraising campaign, lasting a month, is rapidly approaching its deadline. However, as of yesterday, only half of the target has been reached. We must appeal to all sectors, hoping that they will generously contribute within these few days so that the target can be reached, allowing us to get through the harsh winter. We are sincerely hoping for the best. Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wu Lexin of Sanle Pharmacy, who was moved by this newspaper's fundraising efforts for the Old People's Home. He specifically donated 10,000 yuan in response, and said that there are no fewer than a thousand large and small pharmacies in Shanghai. If each of them could uphold the principle of "respecting the elderly in others as we respect our own," and generously contribute to the fund, the amount would be considerable. He hopes that colleagues in the industry will hear the news and rise up together to support this righteous cause. Mr. Wu's kindness is certainly commendable.</p>
<p>Bicycle Industry Donates Vehicles</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bicycle Industry Association has donated a complete bicycle to the Old People's Home for the purpose of collecting rations and other uses, not shirking their responsibility and doing more than expected. The list of donating members is recorded below: Wang Xingye Bicycle Shop donated the entire frame including the gears, Ri Yichang Bicycle Shop donated the chrome handlebars, Deli Bicycle Shop donated chrome steel rims, Datong Bicycle Shop donated brakes, Yuanfang Bicycle Shop donated chains, Tongchang Bicycle Shop donated flywheels and oil lamps, Taichang Bicycle Shop donated pedals, Runda Bicycle Shop donated flower garland brackets, Daxing Bicycle Shop donated leather cushions, Yuanda Bicycle Shop donated steel wires and bells, Hongli Bicycle Shop donated stands and racks, Zhongxing Bicycle Shop donated jacks and reflectors, Yida Bicycle Shop donated a large air pump, and Zhengtai Factory donated "Hui Li" brand inner and outer tires (募 by Tong'an Bicycle Shop).</p>
