<p>社評</p>
<h3>提創科學技術</h3>
<p>科學技術爲近代國家生存之基本要素，本報已迭有所論列，而在戰爭時期之中尤應注意後方科學技術工作，且須加倍努力，以適應戰時經濟之體制與需要，庶可增强國家戰力而爭取最後之勝利。日本最近之表彰科學技術人員與夫德國近年專利執照登記之衆多，（參考本報二月二十一日社評）更定以使吾人知所警惕，而急起直追！</p>
<p>我國科學界及技術界在國際地位上向尠表現，實無庸諱言，而一切近代文明之設備，以及衣食住行上之最低需要，莫不一一仰給於人，此爲顯而易見之事實。倘一旦中國與外界隔絕，則非回復至中古時代之生活不可。似此情形其何以言自存，更何以言自衛。及今戰雲瀰漫生死存亡之秋，而倡言提創科學技術，未免失之太晚，抑且不合時宜。但七年之病應隨即蓄三年之艾，若再遲疑，將終身不得。况目前受生產量低落及原料缺乏之苦痛，適爲促進努力於科學技衛之機會。凡科學技術落伍之國家，必同時爲受人支配之弱小國家，在平時視爲各先進國家科學技術產物之市塲與尾閭，傾銷競爭推售製成物品，强取豪奪攫略天然原料，使所有科學技術之萌芽易於窒息而雞期蓬勃。際此外患擯除，東亞一體决戰將臨千鈞一髮之秋，爲目前，爲將來，爲已爲人，均應把握現實而提創科學技術·至於　手提倡之道，扼要列舉數點，以供有心人士之參考：</p>
<p>政府方面　設立科學技術主管機關，專司通籌推進之職。最重要者爲經費之籌措，方案之規定，與其他公私機關合作之辦法，由試騐而工業化之步驟與協助，與夫保護及勸獎之方法。</p>
<p>學校方面　所有公私實科大學應禀承政府所規定之方案，接受政府之資助，充實需要之設備，羅致品學兼優之人村從事於授課及試騐，誘掖學生使增進研究之興趣。</p>
<p>企業方面　所有公私企業團體亦應稟承政府所規定之方案，並按共本身之性質，協助某一項科學技術之進展，予專科學校之敎師及學生研討之機會，並應具有犧牲之精神而担負因試騐工作所生之一部分損失，尤應與政府共同解決當某項科學技術初步工業化時所不能避免之困難。</p>
<p>社會方面急應改革一般惟利是圖之思想，而鼓吹「公衆利益高於一切」之觀念，破除「大魚吃小魚」之卑劣手段，而從事於創造增產之事業。</p>
<p>總之，我國所處之地位逈非昔比，其隆替消長之影響不僅限於其本身而直接及於整僩東亞，再加以目前劃時代之重大使命當前，就任何方面言，惟有政府，學術機關，企業團體，以及社會人士打成一片，以全體民族集團之精神，共謀科學技術之提倡。</p>
<h3>馬利亞納羣島東　日機轟炸敵艦隊　航空母艦大型艦沉毀五艘</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日大本營二十八日下午四時發表：二月二十二日上午，曾有以航空母艦十餘艘。戰艦八艘　主幹之敵機動部隊，出現於馬利亞納（Mariana）羣島東方海上，帝國海軍航空部隊當即發現敵艦，自二十二日夜至二十三日黎明，對之反覆加以攻擊，擊沉敵航空母艦一艘，大型軍艦三嫂（內二艘或爲航空母艦），擊毀敵航空母艦一艘。迄二十二日上午止，敵艦上機累計約二百架，空襲塞班Saipan鳥迭尼安（Tinlan）及關島（Guam）後，已向東方遁走，我方損害輕微。</p>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美海軍部二十五日夜發表公報，承認馬利亞納羣鳥日航空部隊攻擊美機動部隊之事實，據稱：日軍曾於二十二日攻擊馬利亞納羣島之塞班及迭尼安兩島附近之美機動部隊。同時，美當局亦發表受日軍攻擊之事實，但未公布其所遭損失。又據美太平洋艦隊司令部發表，日軍曾來襲美艦艇。</p>
<p>空襲關島塞班美軍企圖受挫</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　敵軍於十七日反覆空襲特魯克羣鳥後，二十二日上午又以航空母艦十餘艘，戰艦八艘等組成之有力機動部隊，强襲馬利亞納羣島，該敵艦隊即前此攻擊馬紹爾羣鳥及特魯克羣島之艦隊，乃美中部太平洋空軍主力之優秀之一部。二十二日上午，分數羣出現，企圖對迭尼安島，塞班島，關鳥反覆作熾烈空襲，但日海軍於該方面海域布有堅固之哨戒陣，故當發現敵後，即迅速攻擊之，於該日夜半迄二十三日，迭作猛攻。據日大本營發表，曾擊沉其航空母艦一艘，大型軍艦三艘，重創其航空母艦一艘。擊沉之三艘軍艦中，有二艘似爲航空母艦，但尙未能確定，已探悉敵航空母艦二艘，中日海軍機之魚雷後，立即起火，艦體向左方大傾斜，不能行駛，終於沉沒。此次日海軍機之先發制人，敵企圖大受挫折，二十三日上午僅以艦一艘，機二百架，對迭尼安島，塞班島，關島，略事轟炸，即行遁去。</p>
<h3>日海軍顯示實力　美僥倖戰略難逞　松島報導部長重要談話</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　美國於攻擊馬紹爾羣鳥及特魯克後，此次復企圖窺伺馬利亞納羣島，結果遭受日海軍大打擊。關於此次戰果，業經日本大本營發表，茲日駐華艦隊報道部長松島慶三大佐，就此作戰發表談話，解釋日軍之用意，並表明日海軍已有充分準備，以應付敵軍之攻學，茲誌談話內容於後：</p>
<p>此次敵方機勸部隊之實力，較以前更屬强力，敵力企圖以優勢侵入日軍戰略圈之內側，此種行動可謂太目中無人，今試就敵方之企圖加以觀察：第一，從敵方出動太平洋方面戰艦及航空母艦精銳，實施無謂之作戰而觀，可窺見敵力焦慮馬紹爾作戰以來之日軍戰略。第二，再觀察　方之陣容極不平均之海上部隊，尙不出究全係機動部隊之範圍，從此點而觀，可知敵力猶未知　日軍難接近决戰，而仍能採取堂堂之正面作戰。而彼等僅恃航空兵力，作萬一之僥倖，敵軍採取戰略，如遇日軍勁旅，則莫不爲殲滅，且完全暴露唯賴生產力之美國投機的國民性。第三，再由此次敵方機動部隊之組織與行動而觀，可知敵方已失僅以大艦隊作戰之實力與自信力，唯賴航空兵力，倖求萬一之成功，此種幼稚的戰術，徒使後世留一笑柄而已。如此，敵方以低劣之戰略思想，當然遭受大批　艇與兵員葬生魚腹之悲慘結果，而美國軍致首腦採取此種戰爭指導方針，可以表示彼等用意在範絡人心，以謀在總統選舉戰中獲得勝利，如果能明瞭此點，則美國軍人之存心殊爲可憐。</p>
<p>再此次馬利亞納羣島攻擊作戰，又有一點尤値注意，即敵方機動部隊之主要目標在探索日方艦隊主力之所在，企圖引誘挫折日艦隊勢力，但此目的完全歸諸失敗，不啻當頭一盆冷水，由此事亦可明白美國的虛偽宣傳，例如在特魯克作戰以前，尼米茲司令部曾大事宣傳戰續，但至馬利亞納作戰開始即，終止宣傳，僅稱：「戰事尚在繼續中」於再追加發表特魯克作戰戰果，到此點日海軍部隊始終抱冷靜熊度，探悉敵方行動。在馬利亞納之日軍部隊。早已發現敵軍加以適當的攻擊，收獲極大戰果，由此可謂日海軍作戰準備極爲周密，當然，今後之問題，美國必將再圖補充兵力出此一着，敵方將乘太平洋上之間隙或利用氣象條件，突然在某方面出現，但日海軍决不爲敵軍所乘，現正在等待攻擊之時機成熱，凡軸心國國民應信仰日本海軍，即以此次馬利亞納之戰續，亦足以表示日本海軍實力於萬一。</p>
<h3>菲派遣留日生</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　菲律賓外交部曾發表最近派遣第二次留日學生二十五名，刻正慎重銓衡中，被選學生於現地行以三個月之日語及其他準備敎育後，即赴日本。聞今次派遣之留學生，係爲學習農醫等專門技術。</p>
<h3>納蓋德庫戰事　入最後階段　日軍佔領一重要高地</h3>
<p>星斯本二十八日中央社電　阿拉坎戰錢布其頓北方之納萱德庫嶺附近地區，目下似仍在激戰中，據新德里來電　。于阿拉坎作戰之英第十四軍將校，曾言明該戰綫之戰况如次：納萱德庫之攻防戰，現已突入最後階段。日軍於過去十六日間業將該嶺一重要高地究全佔領，故反軸心軍意圖佔取納蓋德庫嶺之作戰，已遭受大阻害。又據聚特巴頓司令部發表稱：日軍仍在布其頓，孟多公路北方地區陸續進攻，中部戰綫琴丘陵地區之兩軍偵察部隊，亦在相互衝突中。</p>
<h3>日本司法長官　開臨時會議　重光氏報告國家情勢</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日司法省爲討論司法機關於决戰下如何發揮其機能，特召集全國各法院長，撿事長，地方裁判所長及檢事正等，於二十八日午前八時三十分假司法省舉行臨時司法長官會議。開會後首由岩林法相致訓詞，繼齊至首相官邸，晋謁東條首相聆訓，並應首相之午餐招待宴。下午一時繼續會議，並由佐藤陸軍軍事局長講述軍事概况。四時由重光外相關述國際情勢第一日議程至此完畢，預定二十九日於首相官邸由岸軍需次官講述軍需生產狀况，午後二時將由各大臣及次官出席　談。刊料决戰下日本司法界對於維持法的秩序之重大使命，將有偉大貢獻。</p>
<h3>日積極準備　非常措置要綱</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日政府爲使國內態勢完全適合戰局之要求，故於二十五日之閣議中通過决戰非常措置要　，現正由關係各省分別本此要綱編製具體案，無論實施之可能與否，或於實施上有如何之困難，日政府决盡量對增强戰力能有最大貢獻者，逐次予以實行。星野書記官長二十八日於定例次官會議席上，曾稅明內閣決定實行之具體案，各省之具體案大體於二十八日亦可決定，提交內閣，又關於須經法律等特別手續者，亦正積極進行準備，俾早日實施藥綱之十五項目，於一兩月內即可全面實施，日國內態勢因此此實施非常措置，即愈形鞏固中之日全國國民，更有果敢之實行力，今後當可充分發揮寂滅英·美之全力，實殊堪期待。</p>
<h3>滿國使節在日　作晉宮觀見　日靑木大臣招待晚宴</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　滿洲國與農部大臣黃宮俊，二十八日上午十時由滿駐日王大使陪同晉宮，於鳳凰間晉　日天皇陛下，謹致敬意後，乃自宮中退下。</p>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相二十八日下午六時於此間帝國飯店舉行晚餐會，招待滿洲國與亞使節滿洲國與農大臣黃富俊，席次靑木大東亞相致辭，對滿洲國致力確立食糧自給態勢表示謝意，並希望今後日·滿在一切方面均有堅固之聯繫，茲誌其辭如次：滿洲國建國以來，於茲已有十二週年，其突飛猛晋之情况，殊堪慶賀者也。大東亞戰爭勃發後，滿洲國更自人力·物力雙方對日本作莫大之協力，我朝野實深感謝，本人去歲歷訪中·滿兩國及南方各地，考察各地建設大東亞之狀况，目擊滿洲國產業經濟之驚人發展，感覺生產戰之前途實力蓬勃，滿洲國朝野一體協力我從事戰爭之實情，更銘佩良多。日·滿食糧自給熊勢之確立，刻已成爲獲得勝利之一大要諦，滿洲國之銳意增產食糧，致去歲得獲豐收，且對於食糧之採迎，更特別努力，故已突破預定額，此對我國及中華民國之食糧政策，裨益甚鉅，今後願滿洲國與我國緊密合力之下，樹立更進一步之增產計劃。</p>
<h3>滿農地開發社　定五一成立</h3>
<p>新京二十八日中央社電　滿政府爲推行本年度之緊急農地造成計劃，乃决改組滿洲土地開發公司，新設滿洲農地開發公社，已制定該公社法，幷組織設立委員會，進行各種設立準備，迄今均吿就緒，已於二十八日解散開發公司，而新公社定於五月一日正式成立。</p>
<p>新京二十八日中央社電　東洋拓殖公司爲利用滿洲國黑河省內小興安嶺山釐之原始林及黑龍江上流沿岸大興安嶺豐富之森林資源，以及嫩江黑龍江支流之豐富水產資源，期以經營兼農牧塲爲中心。而從事農畝林水產業及其加工事業，乃决設北滿開發公司（資本金一千萬圓），刻正準備中，擬由四月起開始工作。</p>
<h3>英美渝　互爭指揮權　內部反感益趨深刻化</h3>
<p>仰光廿八日中央社電　英美前曾應允渝方，以奪回緬甸爲援助之原則，但觀諸緬甸方面戰局之現階段，已完全不可能，故渝方對英美之不滿，乃逐日激化。最近美軍更以供給渝軍武器爲口實，欲將渝軍置於美軍官統率下，故英美渝因指揮統帥問題之反感，益趨深刻化。緣關於緬甸總反攻反軸心軍之指揮統一問題，自去春英美渝於新德里會談後，渝方始終强力主張指揮權之獨立。自去冬東南亞洲反軸心司令部設置後，英美復對渝方强硬耍求，將渝軍之指揮權移歸蒙特巴頓，就中對雲南遠征軍，迄今仍以聯合作戰爲理由，繼續要求指揮權，而美國則瞞曚英國，首將駐印渝軍收於斯蒂維爾之指揮下，更對大陸之渝軍三十師，基於提供武器爲理由，担任訓練工作，於桂林設置幹訓團。今新設軍月中旬以來，對於耳及師團幹部，實施美式戰術戰略通訊技術等訓練，同時更以美人充當渝軍指揮官。且企圖增派美將校約一千名駐華之美少將特爾曼，刻正積極暗行活動中，而英國對美國之此　專　行動，則始終基於愧北克會談，亦主張統一東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部之指揮權。由是觀之英美迄今仍置緬印邊境戰事於度外，互相鬥爭，同時渝軍早巳洞悉美國欲制霸世界之野心，故將採拒絕美國要求之態度。現反軸心軍於阿洛布及夫公等地列戰，面渝雲南遠征軍約廿師，仍恐懼日軍情銳對怒江戰棧加以重視，美國雖以供給渝方五七爲口實，但自現狀觀之，尚不能滿足渝方要求之十分之一。結局美國僅欲以此空頭支要，仗渝軍作爲對日反攻之犧牲軍。但此種盎格魯薩京遜一統之謀略，　已爲渝方看破，故今後英美渝之對日抗爭，已爲各方注目之鵠的云。</p>
<h3>菲總統昨簽署　交通公司法案</h3>

<h3>因資源缺乏　渝產業衰落　外資侵入之危險問題</h3>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　渝方抗戰產業日趨衰落，查其原因，主要者爲資材之缺乏與勞力之不足，及資金之涸竭。故渝方頃曾用盡一切手段，以謀打開此難局。如發行導入外資之計劃，及獎勵國民貯蓄。圖誘導民間遊資投於　業方面。但此等計劃均未能如預期進行，實使渝方焦慮萬狀。關於外資問題，渝方於十一中全會中，曾决定「獎勵外資發展實業法案」，蓋渝方現已處於爲繼續抗戰，重新建立產業，不得不利用外資之情勢故刻正極力歡迎外資。關於此問題，渝政府雖極力提倡，但產業界對之殊極冷淡。渝經濟部長翁文灝對此，曾慨嘆謂「今之產業界人士，對復興產業，態度極爲消極，投資觀念極其淺薄」云。由此亦足已證明產業界所採之態度矣。渝大公報頃就民間資本家之畏忌外資，與外資侵入之危險性，論稱一英美在中國投資，實非出於單純之外意，而係帶有政治色彩，故中國仍不能脫出外國之桎梏。渝十一中全會曾規定外資由國營俾民營事業，得以均等利用之方針，但國營事業若侵人外資，則中國國營事業將有移於外人之手之處。如容許外資投入國營事業，則各種問題將起重大影響，外資問題實應嚴加考慮。渝當局於事業失敗時，則將歸咎於外資不充裕，故英美得藉此在政治上，經濟上，侵略中國，使中國全部一成爲彼等之租界地。是故欲「爲謀中國脫離殖民地地位，除利用自力資本以謀產業建設外，則別無他一途。渝方之經濟建設費，事變前估計爲五億元左右，以現在重慶法幣伸算之，則相當於四百億元左右。重慶本難度之預算為二百億元，若假定其以五成充　設費，則餘額僅爲一白億元，其額實極微。又去年度經渝方四國家銀行貸出之工礦業資金，在民營方面爲十二億元，在國營方面爲入億元，合計爲二十億元，此項數字實無裨於事實。又重慶當局頃實行收買民間牛產品，以謀商品化爲自己，但此項金融，其數過少，並不能挽救當前之困難，故目下渝方資金之涸　，益趨深刻，即實施任何對策，亦無由解決也，故抗戰產業，亦將因此僵化云。</p>

<h3>沿波羅的三國境　鏖戰進行中　蘇生力軍不斷增援</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據前綫之綜合消息，蘇軍似欲以此次中北部戰綫之攻勢，爲决定波羅的海三國命運之戰鬥，而由後方續增生力軍，企圖實行突破作戰，刻正與德軍展開激戰。蘇軍由三方面對愛沙尼亞。拉晚維亞。立陶宛國境進攻，其第一軍之作戰，似擬突破邱西拉將軍麾下之德軍據點之浦斯科夫（Pskov）而進入愛沙尼亞國境，傳目下蘇軍由北方，東北方，東方，三方面，向浦斯科夫進擊。蘇軍與該市之距離，其北方部隊僅十五哩，東北部隊二十哩，東方部隊三十哩，據稱該方面之蘇軍，利用自動卡撬輸送援軍。蘇第一軍已又霍爾姆西方，聞達接近拉脫維亞國境，及浦斯科夫－維爾諾鐵路、該軍目下已越過杜諾－諾伏索科爾尼某鐵路，向拉脫維亞國境推進。西方作戰之蘇第三軍　尤波勃夫將軍所部，於諾伏索科爾尼基沿莫斯科－里如鐵路西進，刻似與諾伏索科爾尼基西方二十哩普洛資克東十哩之德軍　戰中。該部隊之目標。似在到達拉脫維亞國境東方二十六哩之交通要衝勒契薩（Reschitza）</p>
<h3>傳英對土耳其　續施壓力</h3>
<p>安加拉二十八日中央社電　海通社駐土京訪員稱：此問政界人士對最近四十八小時內所傳英對土耳其續施壓力之種種謠言，極爲騷動，其中最引起人之注意者，乃安那托里通訊社所引塔斯社駐土京訪員所發之消息，謂英當局亦不准載有軍火之士耳其輪船一轉臘白松　號貨一倍起卸，但土耳其官方對此數量訪員所發之消息，尚無任何反應。此外奉到延遲起貨之訓令，英美記者並盛傳英已減縮運。安那托里通訊社更發一倫敦　泰晤士報　土訪員所撰之文，力言土耳其今遭遇一間題，即土耳共在國際間之威望，倘不參戰能否予以保持。　泰晤士報　訪員並謂不問土耳其作何决定，惟有一事可以斷言者，即土耳其討論此一問題，僅能再持續數月。由此可知英土間之緊張空氣迄未征服目在今後數週內有更趨緊張之可能</p>
<h3>英美籌備舉行　外交會議</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據瑞典阿夫通報駐美京特派員稱：英美現正在籌備一外交會議，大致在最近之將來即舉行。此會議之目的，乃在謀英外部與美國各院之間成立更密切關係，因有時美國各院之對德政策，未能得英外部之支持，而現時倫敦方面之贊成瓜分德國，亦較華盛頓爲甚。邱吉爾與羅斯福間之直接關係非常良好，但英外部與美國各院之領袖，則對於時事問題意見常不一致。</p>
<h3>義戰綫德軍　使用滑翔炸彈　炸毀納吐諾港灣設施</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　據義境戰綫前綫消息：德軍使用滑翔式炸彈，將納吐諾港灣設施完全炸毀。</p>

<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據倫敦觀察報稱：親蘇派近在莫斯科成立之波蘭國家委員會，任命羅拉將軍爲波軍總司令</p>
<p>日內瓦二十八日中央社電　德國新聞社據「倫敦觀察報」發表：最近在莫斯科成立之「波蘭民組委員會」已實際執行「秘密波蘭政府」之職權，其第一步執行職權之辦法，乃任命另一波軍總司令，以輿論敦流亡波政府總立。該「波蘭民族委員會」亦　發表宣言，允諾一與蘇緊密合作，並與其他反軸心國協調」，而同時並承認蘇聯對波所提出之領土要求。此項發展曾亦吿知倫敦之流亡波政權，當時邱吉爾正向下院演說</p>

<h3>德輪衝破封鎖綫　由日本平安返國</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德商輪「奧索羅一號船長赫爾曼，曾於最近由日返德，途中二次衝破封鎖錢，頃已獲得鐵十字勲章。該輪於駛經中國海時，曾被敵潛艇攻擊二次無效，據乘該輸之某軍官言，該輪未受損失，全因該船長能機警應變。該輪繼於南大西洋屢被敵機命令停駛，但該船長於千鈞一髮之際，竟能冒充英輪而左右局勢。該輪於能受德海軍保護之前，曾用同一巧計衝破第二次封鎖綫，當時該輪乃正駛行於英海岸，但亦能逃過敵機駕駛員之注意。再當該輪向德驅逐艦駛行時，復被敵一山多蘭式一大飛船擊擊，但該飛船在未能擲彈前即被擊落，以一小商輪而擊落大飛船，乃未之前聞者。</p>
<h3>羅斯福與議會的對立</h3>
<p>戰爭是不容有國內的糾紛的，但在美國，隨着戰爭的日趨激烈，其後方戰錢，因遇到了民主政體內在的矛盾，並沒有公正明確的戰爭目的之故，愈形紊亂而不統一。尤其是最近美國的政情，因羅斯福政府的戰爭政策及國內政策的破綻，頗呈混亂狀熊。</p>
<p>正在開會中的美國　表顯了這種不安。這情第七十八屆議會，充分　形在本年十一月的大總統選舉中，因激烈的政爭，將更見惡化。</p>
<p>內有政爭，外有激戰的這種現實，縱使美國蓄有龐大的戰力，但在此次的戰爭過程中，未必不影響到戰爭的現實面。戰爭與政爭，絕非不相干的兩件事。</p>
<p>此次大戰的責任者羅斯福及共一派的美國政府，現在遇到這種嚴重事態，正在研究對策，以克服這難關。事態愈嚴重，其對策亦愈焦急。去年來羅斯福對議會對立的激化，正說明了這事熊。羅斯福所提出的重要議案，或被否决，或經修正，無案得順利通過。</p>
<p>五件重要法案</p>
<p>近例如在本月七日，上下兩院將去年來政府要求的總額百零五億元（併計社會保險費達百五十億元），削減至五分之一，即廿一億元。這反映苦悶於高稅重壓下美國人民的意志。羅斯福新年內致議會函中，提出五件重要法案：即　現實的增稅法，　戰時契約再協議法的繼續，　食糧價格法，　經濟安定法的延長，　國民徵用法的制定。這都是「戰時施策一，但其第一件增稅就遭大削減，是羅斯福近來的大失敗。傳羅斯福拒絕簽署上述增稅案，送返議會。總之，每年須戰費一千億元的美國政府之籌措戰費，今後將愈困難。</p>
<p>其次，羅斯福爲企圖在平年秋的總統選舉中獲選，在議會中提出的容許出征將士行使投票權案，在去冬議會上議論紛紜，未得結論，至本月四日，下院以三百廿八粟對六十九票的大冬數，完全否决政府案，上院則加以修正，於八日以四十六對四十的微差通過。爲因下院的反對佔大多數，所以縱使今後在上下兩院的聯席會上審議折衷案，政府方面亦頗不利。</p>
<p>羅斯福在前次議會中，因「父親召集法案」（召集在美國開戰前有孩子的父親之法案）及禁止食糧助成金法案，亦遇到困難。前者，政府案經重大修正，漸獲通過。後者則不顧政府的反對，通過於下院。這也是羅斯福的戰時施策所受打擊之一。</p>
<p>這五大法案中最堪重視者是國民增用案。對於此案，在野黨共和黨，勞働階級，及各方面都大表反對。</p>
<p>該案的內容。國家欲强制徵用從十八歲到六十歲的男子，及十八歲到五十歲的女子，該案並企圓禁止一切勞動糾紛，故勞働階級均加以非難攻擎。羅斯福說國民徽用案不在政治範圍內，但反對黨則利用之爲攻擊政府的好資料</p>
<p>反對派的勢力</p>
<p>美國議會的勢力，現在下院議席總數四百卅五席中，民主黨二百十八，共和黨二百另九，進步黨二，農民勞働黨一，美國勞動黨一，空席四。與黨所占的過半數不過四票。且與黨內含有很多反政府議員，故事實上羅斯福已失掉了下院的過半數。上院議席總數九十六席中，民主黨五十八，共和黨三十七，進步黨一，與黨占廿票的過半數，但在增稅案，出征將士行使投票權案，父親召集法案等的審議中，上院的反政府勢力，亦不可侮。</p>
<p>這樣看來，美國政情的不安，跟着戰爭的激化，與羅斯福內外秕政的累積，必然愈見深刻。</p>
<p>戰爭與國內政爭，這並立是美國欲淸算而不能情算之現實的苦悶。（每日新聞歐美部副部長高田市太郞）（翔：譯自二月十二日東京每日新聞）</p>

<h3>中日新聞界懇談會　希望將中國新聞界的意見帶回日本去</h3>

<p>日本國民私生活已壓抑到最低限度</p>
<p>高石會長致辭</p>
<p>略謂：一今天承蒙上海新聞界諸君賞光，非常欣幸。我這次到南方旅行，目的之一，是奉陸海軍當局囑託，老察南方各地準備創辦新聞組。今天的懇談會，我不想多講話，很　似聽諸位的高見。不過想簡單的介紹敝國現狀。敝國在任何方面，都以爭取大東亞戰爭勝利爲總目標，全體國民的私生活，已經壓抑到最低限度，埤頭苦幹，貢獻一切力量，向總目標邁進。我們的日常生活，壓抑到怎樣的程度？怎樣階段？也許諸位不能想像。同時，全體國民也都抱具戰爭必勝的信念、因爲這次戰爭，不能失敗的。如果失敗了，那未，整個東亞，就此滅亡。我們都有這一個警覺的觀念。戰爭的條件，首要是生產力量，尤其是軍需生產，飛機生產。目前敝國的生產程度，如以數字統計，已經到達驚奇的地步。可是，爲了確保勝利，必須更加充實生產力量，中國是日本的同盟國，所以，日本很股切的期待，希望能够分擔任務。在任何方面，非得到貴國的協力不爲功。諸位都是新聞界負責人，由新聞界的共同努力，促成全面的共同努力，這是我的素願，特別盼望諸位共同實現這個素願。</p>
<p>隨便發表意見請高石會長帶回日本</p>
<p>尾坂社長致詞</p>
<p>繼由大陸新報社尾坂社長致詞，略謂：一高石會長，在日本無論於政洽界經濟界，都有相常重要的地位，今天能與上海新聞界同人見而聚談，是回國之便，報吿日本當局，這是更有意義的機會。現在請許力求先生，陳彬龢先生發表意見。致詞畢適有日本大本營發表之馬利亞納羣島擎沉敵艦的要電遞到，當即宣讀，全塲鼓掌。</p>
<p>堅定必勝信念才能達成戰勝目的</p>
<p>許力求氏致詞</p>
<p>高石會長過去對於三國同盟，中日同盟之成立，貢獻很大的力量。今天得機談語，頗感欣幸。對於高石會長所講的話，我完全同意。這次戰爭開始，即認定是長期戰爭，最要者在於堅定必勝信念，才能爭取最後勝利。可是，我們要知道世界各國，沒有不犧牲而能成功的，犧牲固然是痛苦的，因爲爭取勝利，就不能不犧牲。戰爭的進退，戰略上應有的動態，不能預料，除非具備必勝信念，才能達到目的。信念怎樣產生呢？首先人民與政府合作。盟邦日本對於南京國民政府自還都以來，已盡很大的協助力量，很足感謝。一個積貧積弱的中國，百孔千瘡，但是相信人民與政府一定能够協力，打破困難。戰時國家，無分在朝在野，必須團體一致。去年我參加大東亞新聞大會，看到日本銀國一致的團結精神，實使我非常感動。</p>
<p>文化配合軍事進展軍事基礎才穩固</p>
<p>本報陳社長詞</p>
<p>略謂：很感謝高石會長帶來了一個大捷消息。同時，我不想說客套話。就想懇求同石會長帶一些敞國老百姓的意見回到貴國去。這次高石會長去南方旅行，最重要的使侖是準備在南方重要地點創辦新聞紙。大家知道日本在軍事上已經確保勝利的優勢。可是，在政治與文化方面如果不能平均進展，不能配合軍事進展，那末，軍事基礎還不能十分穩固。談到文化方面的進展，那末，新聞事業，就是先鋒部隊。</p>
<p>過去南洋各地。是英美文化侵略的基地，這次高石會長去南方計劃辦報，從文化方面講，是最有意義的舉措。這裏，我想到南洋各地有許多敝國僑民—就是華僑，有三種請求順便請高石會長帶回東京：</p>
<p>第一，南洋文化政策的對象，一定顧到華僑</p>
<p>第二，日本在南洋各地的軍政當局，應與當地第一流華僑合作，他們在過去或許爲英美所驅使，希望日本當局不再追咎以往的行動。</p>
<p>第三，希望協助上海的的紙，以最迅速的方法運往南洋，使華僑閱讀，瞭解國內實况。</p>
<p>誰能爭取民心誰就成功</p>
<p>其次，我們可以預想南方各地政治建設諸問題，比較容易解决，而且一年半來頗有成績。我們認爲大東亞範圍以內。最難解决的，還是中國的問題。現在約略談些中國問題。</p>
<p>中國國內，目前有三種政治勢力，是不可否認的。第一是我們所擁護的南京國民政府。第二是爲敵人英美所利用的重慶政權。第三是利用重慶拖戰政策。擴張實力，欺騙人民，爲害祖國的共產黨。因爲中國的敎育不普及，所以人民的知識水準比較低下，說句老實話，中國一般人民，還沒有判斷政治的能力。人民的感覺中，誰能够帮助解决民生問題，誰就獲得民心。現在這三　政治勢力相互比賽着。這三種政治勢力中，當然南京國民政府客觀上最有力量，統治的人民最多，統治的地方父富庶，物產　饒，只要政治革新，努力解决民生問題有辦法，一定會得到全民的擁　。</p>
<p>焦慮的是民生問題中的物價問題</p>
<p>不過，焦急的就是目前民生問題中最主要的物價問題，如以民國廿五年物價指數爲基準一〇〇，那末，到去年年底的物價指數已增加一百五十倍以上，特別的幾種物價，竟漲至三百倍以至五百倍。今天的上海黑市米漲得更爲驚人，而上海人口中十分之七八是薪水階級，普通薪水月入不過二千至三千兀，所以講到民牛問題，困難已達極點，假使民牛問題無法解决，什麼建設？什麼協力？都成空話。况且，民生無法解决，不但談不到建設，談不到協力，還有最嚴重的心腹大患在隱伏着。</p>
<p>心腹大患必須嚴切注意</p>
<p>心腹大患是什麼呢？　是共產黨。果然，貴國一天天的　潰英美敵人的勢力；如果中國共產黨勢力一天天的膨脹，這樣的情勢，大東亞問題還是不能圓滿解决的、所以希望日本新聞界前輩特別注意中國的民生問題。我們站在同業立塲，希望貴國新聞界注意幾點；</p>
<p>關於中國的消息，資料，在量的方面，希望比現在多刋登些。</p>
<p>發表中國的消息，資料，不要太偏重政治消息。儘量多發表關於中國民生問題及人民動態的消息，資料。</p>
<p>所發表的消息，資料，一定要正確。</p>
<p>中國新聞界從業員，尤以上海方面，實在覺得本身力量蒲弱，能力不够。所以，希望盟邦日本新聞界先進在技術上協助。</p>
<p>我曾與鹽田大尉談過，目前報道宣傳工作，應以大東亞戰爭消息爲中心，可是大東亞戰爭消息，在東京的報紙，每次發表得很詳細，很生動，而在上海　紙就很簡略。其實，戰爭消息，一定要生動活潑，如果旣短而又　燥，宣傳力量　會減少。依照這個標準，則中國報紙一年以來，對於戰爭報道，可說未曾盡職。以敝報而論，常常在一星期或句日後，再從貴國報紙翻譯轉載，以爲補充。其次，東京的重要消息，上海大陸新報可以翌日發表者，中文報紙往往遲一天刋載。道原因是在中央社的力量不够。在消息報道方面，希望協助中央社加强能力，每次發表的戰時消息，與貴國報紙發表的同樣詳盡與迅速。</p>
<p>最後，我們中國新聞界同人，應該有一件事學習高石會長，我們觀察高石會長的丰采，不過五十來歲模樣，可是，他今年高壽已經六十七歲，服務新聞界已經四十四年了。聽說高石會長善於遝動，考爾夫球技術在日本首屈一指，所以身體很健康，我們就是要學他的健康，健康以後，才能發展事業。</p>
<p>先發制敵收穫特殊戰果</p>
<p>松島部長致詞</p>
<p>艦隊報道部松島部長，在晚餐前致詞，略謂：「今天乘機向諸位說明最近太平洋戰局，敵人自從在馬紹爾羣島登陸以後，屢次發動攻勢，均遭日軍擎退，但敵軍雖艇吿失敗而蠢動不已，窺察敵人目標，是在無聊的搗亂而已。最近在　利亞納羣島方面，敵軍以主力艦八艘，航空母艦十餘艘爲主幹的機動部隊，出現島東海面，日本海軍航空部隊即於二月二十二日夜至二十三日黎明，施以猛烈攻擊，結果擊沉敵航空母艦一艘，大型戰艦三艘，並重傷航空母艦一艘。其後敵以飛機二百架空襲塞班仔迭尼安等地，我方受損極徵。敵人最大失敗、就在策動攻勢以後，即被日軍發現，立以迅雷不及掩耳之手段，先發制敵，恒能收獲特殊戰果。今天託福高石會長，發表這們特異的戰果。</p>

<h3>國民論壇防疫合理化</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>防疫政策，固須强化，然首須合理化，茲將現行制度，一加檢討，然後再謀改進之方，以供衛生當局之參考。　　種痘：天花一症，根本爲兒童疾患，成人患者，千萬人中難遇一人，且種痘一次，可以免疫多年，固無須年年復種，更國偉生法規，均無年種兩次之規定。顧在我國則不然，以上海論，去年春秋二季，一經普遍種痘兩次，此刻又正籌備舉行，並有痘證貼照之規定。不過種痘一事，並非百無禁忌，許多患有嚴重性慢性疾病之人，一經種痘，可使痘後腦炎，EncepholitePost　Vaccinale尤為習見之事實。此不合理者一</p>
<p>防疫注射：防疫針注射，並非絕對無所禁忌有寒熱者不宜注射，有急性病之嫌疑者不宜注射，他如患進行性之結核症者，患心肌炎者，患腎臟炎而有蛋白尿者，患血尿病者，患糖尿病者，患胃　者，有脚氣病者，年老衰弱及懷孕在身者，均不宜注射、我國號稱病夫之國，此類病人，隱藏必多，普遍接重千萬人中。豈無若干犧牲之輩。且防疫注射，必須由少量遞加，三次注射，方可免疫，今於馬路之上，强迫注射，一針之後，即給證書，是否有效，此不合理者二。</p>
<p>根據上述，可見防疫政策，必須審愼從事，不可輕率施行，尤須與民間醫師合作，方可收有利無弊之效，民衆必須先請醫師診察，健全者無論矣，其有嚴重性隱病之人，得　禁忌證書，可以免於種痘與注射，種痘證書，五年有效，（天花流行猖　之時除外）種痘政令，不妨年年舉行，而已抓之人，無須年年復種，似此則防疫政策固可推行無阻，而民衆健康亦不稍受打擊。</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>兵學校論（二）</p>
<p>海軍岩田豐雄著洪羊譯</p>
<p>這學校和普通的學校不同。充滿着別的學校所沒有的精神。並且同那學熟或道塲也不相同，絕對不以指導發揮學生個人的人格和個性為敎育的方針。同時使精神和科學相融洽並重，决不偏重一方。為了學習科學的學術，而給與學生們以莫大的時問和設備。是這學校跟僧院或道塲相異的地方。德育偏重或智育偏重，是別處學校的問題。總而言之，兵學校是特殊的學校。也許可以說是眞正的學校。在這峻嚴的學校中，施行自治制度，倡導自律的精神－－這樣說起來，也許有懷疑的人。自治，自律，自啓是這學校七十年來的傳統精神。</p>
<p>共生死的同期生的友誼，是　的結合，在校中分隊的制度是縱的結合，都是由於這種傳統而來的。四十餘人的各個分隊，以上級生為中心，營着自治的生活，在學生之間，無論是軍規，風紀，傳統，光榮，都永久地繼續保存着。「為分隊名譽起見「學生們，競養時必須要得到勝利，自己的身心必須要檢點的，秩序是必須要維持的。上級學生同下級學生混在一起的分隊制度，確是一種英明的措置。教官不過以深切的愛和注意在旁邊監　着。</p>
<p>兵學核好比是一個艦隊，分隊好比是一個艦艇。分隊由此自治行動，而融合於大的統率之下</p>
<p>所以這學校的上級生同下級生的差別，有在別處見不到的特色。不僅是因為是上級生而偉大，實際上上級生就是偉大。這便是鍛鍊的時問長短的關係。譬如春秋二季，到兵學校來觀光的男女人士，從吳市或廣島前來的環列如堵，四號生的態度，雖然也非卜能鎭靜自處若無其事。但總不像一號學生那樣看風吹方向似地，絲毫不動聲色。在禪寺中修養的靑年僧侶的師兄師弟的分別，在這兒也可一覽無遺。稱呼世問為「俗世」的海軍隱語，實在是一個很有興味的名詞，在這種塲合，也可以表現出來的。</p>
<p>在這個學校，最排斥像女性似的柔弱的態度，那不只限於必須保持必勝的信念而已。用功的時候要用功，遊玩的時候要遊玩－這種集中主義，意志和理性的行動，結局就是男性似的自律的熊度。巧言辯解都是女性的態度，用盡體力同智力奮鬥到底，整服裝正容儀，無非都是發揚眞正的男性的特徵。</p>

<h3>Promoting Science and Technology</h3>
<p>Science and technology are fundamental elements for the survival of a modern nation, as this newspaper has repeatedly discussed. During wartime, special attention should be paid to scientific and technological work in the rear, with redoubled efforts to adapt to the wartime economic system and needs. Only in this way can we enhance national strength and strive for final victory. The recent Japanese recognition of scientific and technical personnel, and the large number of patent registrations in Germany in recent years (refer to this newspaper's editorial of February 21), should serve as a wake-up call, urging us to catch up!</p>
<p>It is undeniable that China's scientific and technological circles have shown little presence in the international arena. All modern facilities, as well as the most basic needs of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, are dependent on others. This is a clear and obvious fact. If China were to be isolated from the outside world, it would inevitably revert to medieval times. How could we speak of self-preservation, let alone self-defense, under such circumstances? To advocate for the promotion of science and technology now, with the clouds of war looming and the survival of the nation at stake, may seem too late and out of sync with the times. However, a seven-year illness requires storing up moxa for three years; further hesitation will lead to lifelong regret. Moreover, the current suffering from low production and material shortages provides an opportunity to promote efforts in scientific and technological defense. Any nation lagging behind in science and technology is inevitably a weak and small nation subject to the control of others. In peacetime, it is regarded as a market and a sink for the scientific and technological products of advanced nations, dumping, competing to sell manufactured goods, forcibly seizing natural resources, making it easy to stifle the budding of all scientific and technological development and hindering their flourishing. With the elimination of external troubles imminent, and the decisive battle for the unity of East Asia on the horizon, for the present, for the future, for ourselves and for others, we should seize the reality and promote science and technology. As for the ways to promote it, a few key points are listed below for the reference of interested parties:</p>
<p>Government: Establish a competent science and technology authority to be responsible for overall planning and promotion. The most important tasks are fundraising, formulating plans, collaborating with other public and private organizations, taking steps from experimentation to industrialization and assistance, as well as protection and encouragement methods.</p>
<p>Schools: All public and private science and engineering universities should follow the plans prescribed by the government, accept government funding, enrich necessary equipment, recruit virtuous and talented individuals to engage in teaching and experimentation, and encourage students to increase their interest in research.</p>
<p>Enterprises: All public and private enterprises should also follow the plans prescribed by the government and, according to their own nature, assist in the progress of a certain science and technology, provide teachers and students of specialized schools with opportunities for research, and should have a spirit of sacrifice to bear some of the losses incurred in the experimental work, and should jointly resolve with the government the difficulties that cannot be avoided when a certain science and technology is initially industrialized.</p>
<p>Society: It is urgent to reform the general idea of ​​profiteering and advocate the concept that "public interests are above all else," to break the despicable means of "big fish eat small fish," and to engage in creative and productive enterprises.</p>
<p>In short, China's position is very different from the past, and its rise and fall affect not only itself but also the entire East Asia. Furthermore, given the momentous and epoch-making mission ahead, from any perspective, only by uniting the government, academic institutions, enterprises, and social figures into one, and promoting science and technology with the spirit of the entire ethnic group, can we achieve our goals.</p>
<h3>East of the Mariana Islands - Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Fleet - Five Aircraft Carriers and Large Ships Sunk or Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4 p.m. on the 28th: On the morning of February 22nd, an enemy mobile force, composed mainly of more than ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships, appeared in the sea east of the Mariana Islands. The Imperial Navy Air Force immediately discovered the enemy fleet, and launched repeated attacks on it from the night of the 22nd to the dawn of the 23rd, sinking one enemy aircraft carrier and three large warships (two of which may have been aircraft carriers), and damaging one enemy aircraft carrier. Up to the morning of the 22nd, a total of about 200 aircraft from the enemy ships raided Saipan, Tinian, and Guam before fleeing eastward. Our losses were minor.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department issued a communiqué on the night of the 25th, acknowledging the fact that the Japanese Air Force in the Mariana Islands attacked the U.S. mobile force. It stated that the Japanese army attacked the U.S. mobile force near Saipan and Tinian in the Mariana Islands on the 22nd. At the same time, the U.S. authorities also announced the fact that they were attacked by the Japanese army, but did not disclose their losses. According to the U.S. Pacific Fleet Command, the Japanese army attacked U.S. warships.</p>
<p>American Attempts to Bomb Guam and Saipan Thwarted</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - After the enemy repeatedly raided Truk Islands on the 17th, a powerful mobile force composed of more than ten aircraft carriers and eight battleships launched a strong attack on the Mariana Islands on the morning of the 22nd. This enemy fleet was the fleet that previously attacked the Marshall Islands and Truk Islands, and was one of the best parts of the U.S. Central Pacific Air Force. On the morning of the 22nd, they appeared in several groups, attempting to launch fierce raids on Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Guam, but the Japanese Navy had a solid patrol formation in the area, so when the enemy was discovered, they quickly attacked it, launching fierce attacks repeatedly from midnight of that day to the 23rd. According to the announcement of the Japanese General Headquarters, they sank one aircraft carrier, three large warships, and severely damaged one aircraft carrier. Among the three sunk warships, two seemed to be aircraft carriers, but it has not yet been determined. It has been learned that two enemy aircraft carriers immediately caught fire after being hit by torpedoes from Japanese naval aircraft, the hull was greatly tilted to the left, and they could not sail and eventually sank. This preemptive strike by the Japanese Navy greatly thwarted the enemy's attempt. On the morning of the 23rd, only one ship and 200 aircraft briefly bombed Tinian Island, Saipan Island, and Guam before fleeing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Displays Strength - American Risky Strategy Hard to Succeed - Important Speech by Director of the Matsushima Reporting Department</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai - After attacking the Marshall Islands and Truk, the United States attempted to peek at the Mariana Islands, resulting in a major blow from the Japanese Navy. Regarding this battle result, it has been announced by the Japanese General Headquarters. Colonel Keizo Matsushima, Director of the Reporting Department of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, made a speech on this operation, explaining the intention of the Japanese army, and stating that the Japanese Navy is fully prepared to deal with the enemy's attack. The content of the speech is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The strength of the enemy's mobile force this time is even stronger than before. The enemy's attempt to intrude into the inner side of the Japanese military's strategic circle with superior forces can be said to be too arrogant. Now, let's observe the enemy's intentions: First, from the enemy's dispatch of elite battleships and aircraft carriers in the Pacific for meaningless operations, we can see the enemy's anxiety about the Japanese military's strategy since the Marshall Islands operation. Second, observing the enemy's extremely uneven maritime force, which is still entirely within the scope of the mobile force, we can know that the enemy still does not know that the Japanese army is difficult to approach for a decisive battle, and can still adopt a grand frontal battle. And they only rely on air power, hoping for a lucky chance. The strategy adopted by the enemy army, if it encounters a powerful Japanese army, will be annihilated, and it completely exposes the speculative national character of the United States, which only relies on productivity. Third, judging from the organization and actions of the enemy's mobile force this time, we can know that the enemy has lost the strength and confidence to fight with large fleets alone, and only relies on air power, hoping for a lucky success. This naive tactic will only leave a laughingstock for later generations. As such, the enemy's inferior strategic thinking will inevitably lead to the tragic result of a large number of warships and soldiers being buried in the belly of the fish. The heads of the American military adopting such a war guidance policy can show that their intention is to win over the people and seek victory in the presidential election campaign. If this can be understood, then the intentions of the American soldiers are very pitiful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is another point to pay attention to in this Mariana Islands attack operation, that is, the main goal of the enemy's mobile force was to explore the location of the main force of the Japanese fleet, attempting to lure and frustrate the Japanese fleet's strength, but this goal completely failed, like a bucket of cold water poured on their heads. From this, we can also understand the false propaganda of the United States. For example, before the Truk operation, the Nimitz Command made a big publicity of the battle results, but when the Mariana operation began, the propaganda was terminated, only saying: "The battle is still ongoing." Then, additional battle results of the Truk operation were released. At this point, the Japanese Navy Department has always maintained a calm attitude, exploring the enemy's actions. The Japanese army in the Mariana Islands had already discovered the enemy and launched appropriate attacks, reaping great battle results. From this, it can be said that the Japanese Navy's battle preparations are extremely thorough. Of course, the problem from now on is that the United States will definitely try to replenish its forces and make another move. The enemy will suddenly appear in a certain area by taking advantage of gaps in the Pacific or utilizing weather conditions, but the Japanese Navy will never be taken advantage of by the enemy, and is now waiting for the opportunity to attack to ripen. All Axis nationals should have faith in the Japanese Navy, as even the battle results of this time in the Mariana Islands are enough to show the strength of the Japanese Navy to its fullest extent.</p>

<h3>Nagadeku Battle Enters Final Stage - Japanese Army Occupies an Important High Ground</h3>
<p>Cynsburg, 28th (Central News Agency) - The area near Nagadeku Ridge north of Butheton on the Arakan battlefront seems to still be in fierce fighting. According to a New Delhi dispatch, an officer of the British 14th Army fighting in Arakan stated the battle situation on that front as follows: The battle for Nagadeku has now entered its final stage. The Japanese army has completely occupied an important high ground of the ridge in the past sixteen days, so the operation of the anti-Axis forces to occupy Nagadeku Ridge has been greatly hindered.

Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia gave a speech, expressing his gratitude to Manchukuo for its efforts to establish a self-sufficient food supply system, and hoping that Japan and Manchukuo will have solid ties in all aspects in the future. The speech is recorded as follows: It has been twelve years since the founding of Manchukuo, and its rapid progress is particularly gratifying. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo has provided tremendous assistance to Japan in terms of both manpower and materials, which is deeply appreciated by our government and people. Last year, I visited China, Manchukuo, and various places in the South, and examined the situation of building Greater East Asia in various places. I witnessed the amazing development of industry and economy in Manchukuo and felt the vigorous strength of the future of the production war. The reality that the government and people of Manchukuo are working together to help me engage in the war is even more memorable. The establishment of the self-sufficiency system for food in Japan and Manchukuo has now become a major key to winning victory. Manchukuo has worked hard to increase food production, resulting in a bumper harvest last year, and has made special efforts to collect and welcome food, so it has exceeded the planned amount. This is of great benefit to the food policies of our country and the Republic of China. In the future, under the close cooperation of Manchukuo and our country, we hope to establish a further production increase plan.</p>

<h3>Britain, America, and Chongqing Contend for Command - Internal Antipathy Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yangon, 28th (Central News Agency) - Britain and the United States had previously promised Chongqing that taking back Burma would be the principle of assistance, but judging from the current stage of the war in Burma, it is completely impossible, so Chongqing's dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States is intensifying day by day. Recently, the U.S. military, under the pretext of providing weapons to the Chongqing army, wanted to place the Chongqing army under the command of U.S. officers, so the antipathy of Britain, America, and Chongqing due to the command issue is intensifying. Regarding the issue of unified command of the anti-Axis forces in the overall counterattack in Burma, since the meeting of Britain, America, and Chongqing in New Delhi last spring, Chongqing has always strongly advocated the independence of command. Since the establishment of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command last winter, Britain and the United States have hardened their demands on Chongqing, transferring the command of the Chongqing army to Mountbatten. In particular, the Yunnan Expeditionary Force is still continuing to demand command rights under the pretext of joint operations. The United States is concealing from Britain and first placing the Chongqing army stationed in India under the command of Stilwell. Furthermore, the U.S. is responsible for training the 30 divisions of the Chongqing army on the mainland, setting up a cadre training group in Guilin. Since mid-month, the newly established military has been implementing training in American-style tactics, strategies, and communication techniques for ear and division cadres. At the same time, Americans are being assigned as commanders of the Chongqing army. It is also attempting to increase the number of U.S. generals to about 1,000 stationed in China. U.S. Major General Telman is actively engaged in secret activities. Britain, based on the Quebec meeting, also advocates unifying the command of the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command for this exclusive action of the United States. From this point of view, Britain and the United States are still ignoring the war on the Burmese-Indian border and fighting each other. At the same time, the Chongqing army has long seen through the ambition of the United States to dominate the world and will adopt an attitude of rejecting the demands of the United States. Currently, the anti-Axis forces are fighting in Arakob and Fukung and other places. The Yunnan Expeditionary Force of about 20 divisions is still afraid of the sharp Japanese army and attaches importance to the Nu River battlefield. Although the United States is using the pretext of supplying Chongqing with 57s, judging from the current situation, it still cannot satisfy one-tenth of Chongqing's demands. In the end, the United States only wants to use this empty check to use the Chongqing army as a sacrificial army for the counterattack against Japan. However, this Anglo-Saxon unification plot has been seen through by Chongqing, so the anti-Japanese resistance of Britain, America, and Chongqing in the future has become the focus of attention.</p>

<h3>Yin Rugeng and Others Have Completed Inspection of the Canal - Hosting a Cordial Talk with Various Circles After Returning to Beijing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan previously dispatched Yin Rugeng, Director of the Canal Management Preparatory Office, to repair the stagnant canal and open up navigation. It is reported that since the establishment of the office, the work has been unusually tense. In order to embody Chairman Wang's instructions to repair the canal water conservancy and increase production, and to facilitate the exchange of materials between the north and the south, Director Yin, together with Lin Gengyu, head of the Planning Group, and Lei Yuxi, head of the Finance Group, on the 21st of this month, convened relevant personnel from the Allied Forces General Headquarters, the Military Advisory Department of the Embassy, ​​and the Naval Advisory Department. They took four warships of the Chinese Navy, Jiangning and Jiangqing, and went to Yangzhou, Gaoyou, and Baoying for detailed inspection, escorted by Allied warships along the canal. The inspection was completed on the 26th and returned to Beijing. Yesterday (the 28th), a cordial talk was held with various Chinese and foreign agencies to facilitate contact. On that day, the Chinese side included the Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, and the Finance, Interior, Construction, Industry, Land, Navy, and Water Conservancy Departments, with representatives from various agencies such as Xu Gongding, Wu Gengshi, Tao Sicheng, Chen Dongsheng, Shao Zhongxiang, and Hu Zhenting, totaling more than 20 people. On the Allied side, there were Lieutenant Colonel Tsuzawa of the Japanese Army General Headquarters, Staff Officer Major Ito, and representatives from the Military Advisory Department and Naval Advisory Department of the Embassy, ​​including Lieutenant Colonel Okamoto, First Secretary Yamamoto, Investigator Kido, and Assistant Officer Sando, totaling more than 10 people. The director of the office, the head of the group, and specialist members also attended the meeting. The Director of the shares reported on the details of the inspection. Local officials were extremely willing to assist, and people along the river especially longed to repair the canal locks as soon as possible so that transportation could be smooth, materials could be exchanged, floods could be eliminated, farmland could be irrigated, people's suffering could be relieved, and all production could be increased to meet wartime needs. He also presented several key points for continued repairs, hoping for assistance from all parties. The words were sincere. Later, Lin Gengyu, head of the Planning Group of the office, reported on the current shipping conditions along the river and the repairs at various points. Then, Lieutenant Colonel Tsuzawa of the Japanese Army General Headquarters and staff officer explained in detail that the Allied side hoped that the canal management office would work hard to promote, the director would firmly preside over and resolutely carry out the project, and hoped that China would use its own strength to make the Japanese people recognize China more and automatically complete this major undertaking. Japan has decided to provide full assistance to ensure success. In the future, after the canal is repaired, it is hoped that all Chinese ships will be allowed to sail freely within a possible range to achieve the purpose of benefiting the country and facilitating the people. The responsibility for this canal management project is significant, and it is hoped that it will be carried through to the end and completed as soon as possible so that both Chinese and foreign people will benefit from it. Subsequently, Xu Gongding, Director of the Yongli Department, explained in detail the water flow system of the Jiangbei Huaiyun Rivers and the causes of past floods, and it is extremely important to repair the canal in the future. In particular, the sluice gates and dams must be repaired to eliminate hidden dangers, and plans to repair the rivers in Jiangsu and Shandong will be explained in detail for reference. Finally, Director Yin expressed his gratitude to the representatives, and stated that he deeply knew that this responsibility was significant, but in order to live up to Chairman Wang's concern for the people's livelihood and the virtue of repairing the stagnant river, and to assist the Allies in completing the Holy War of Greater East Asia, in order to build water conservancy, increase production, and relieve the material difficulties of the people, he would resolutely devote himself to it and achieve success. It was not until after 6:00 p.m. that everyone dispersed happily.</p>
<h3>Due to Resource Shortages, Chongqing Industry Declines; Danger of Foreign Capital Invasion</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing's wartime industries are declining daily. Upon investigation, the main reasons are the lack of resources and labor, and the depletion of funds. Therefore, Chongqing has been exhausting all means to try to break out of this difficult situation, such as issuing plans to introduce foreign capital and encouraging national savings, attempting to guide private idle capital into industrial development. However, these plans have not proceeded as expected, causing Chongqing extreme anxiety. Regarding the issue of foreign capital, Chongqing decided at the Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee to enact the "Regulations for Encouraging Foreign Capital to Develop Industries." This is because Chongqing is now in a situation where it must utilize foreign capital to continue the war of resistance and re-establish its industries, and is therefore vigorously welcoming foreign investment. Regarding this issue, although the Chongqing government is strongly advocating it, the industrial sector is extremely indifferent to it. Weng Wenhao, Chongqing's Minister of Economic Affairs, lamented this, saying, "Today's industrialists are extremely passive towards revitalizing industry, and their investment concepts are extremely shallow." This is sufficient to prove the attitude adopted by the industrial sector. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao recently commented on the capitalist's fear of foreign capital and the danger of foreign capital invasion, stating that British and American investment in China is not purely out of simple goodwill, but is politically colored, so China cannot escape the shackles of foreign countries. The Eleventh Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee stipulated that foreign capital should be used equally by both state-owned and private enterprises. However, if state-owned enterprises are invaded by foreign capital, then China's state-owned enterprises will fall into foreign hands. If foreign capital is allowed to invest in state-owned enterprises, various problems will have a major impact, and the issue of foreign capital should be carefully considered. When the Chongqing authorities' ventures fail, they will blame it on insufficient foreign capital, so Britain and the United States can take this opportunity to politically and economically invade China, making all of China their concession. Therefore, if we want "to liberate China from its colonial status, there is no other way but to use our own capital to build industry." The economic construction cost of Chongqing was estimated at about 500 million yuan before the war. Calculated in Chongqing legal tender now, it is equivalent to about 40 billion yuan. Chongqing's budget for this difficult time is 20 billion yuan. Assuming that 50% is used for construction costs, the remaining amount is only 10 billion yuan, which is an extremely small amount. Furthermore, the working capital loans issued by Chongqing's four national banks to industrial and mining enterprises last year amounted to 1.2 billion yuan for private enterprises and 800 million yuan for state-owned enterprises, totaling 2 billion yuan. This figure does not help the reality. Furthermore, the Chongqing authorities are currently implementing the purchase of private cattle products in order to commercialize them for themselves, but this financing is too small and cannot save the current difficulties. Therefore, the depletion of Chongqing's funds is becoming more profound, and no matter what countermeasures are implemented, there is no way to solve it. Therefore, the wartime industry will also become stagnant.</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles in Progress Along Baltic Borders; Soviet Fresh Troops Continuously Reinforcing</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to a compilation of news from the front lines, the Soviet army seems to want to make this offensive on the central and northern fronts the battle to determine the fate of the three Baltic countries, and is continuously reinforcing fresh troops from the rear, attempting to carry out a breakthrough operation. They are currently engaged in fierce battles with the German forces. The Soviet army is attacking Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania from three directions. The operations of the First Army seem to be aimed at breaking through the German stronghold of Pskov under the command of General Küchler and entering Estonian territory. It is reported that the Soviet army is currently attacking Pskov from the north, northeast, and east. The northern forces of the Soviet army are only 15 miles away from the city, the northeastern forces are 20 miles away, and the eastern forces are 30 miles away. It is said that the Soviet army in that area is using motorized sleds to transport reinforcements. The Soviet First Army has also moved west of Kholm, reportedly approaching the Latvian border and the Pskov-Vilnius railway. The army has now crossed the Dno-Novosokolniki railway and is advancing towards the Latvian border. The Soviet Third Army, commanded by General Yushkevich, operating in the west, is advancing west along the Moscow-Riga railway from Novosokolniki and is reportedly in battle with German forces 20 miles west of Novosokolniki and 10 miles east of Ploski. The unit's objective seems to be to reach Reschitza, a transportation hub 26 miles east of the Latvian border.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Continued British Pressure on Turkey</h3>
<p>Ankara, 28th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters correspondent in Ankara reports that political figures there are extremely agitated by the various rumors of continued British pressure on Turkey in the last 48 hours. The most attention-grabbing of these is a report from the Ankara correspondent of the TASS news agency, quoted by the Anatolian News Agency, stating that British authorities are also prohibiting the Turkish ship 'Trabzon-Samsun' from unloading cargo, including munitions. However, Turkish officials have made no response to the news reported by this correspondent. In addition, orders to delay shipments have been received, and British and American reporters are widely spreading the news that Britain has reduced transport. The Anatolian News Agency also issued an article written by a 'Times' correspondent in Turkey, strongly arguing that Turkey is now facing a question: whether Turkey can maintain its international prestige if it does not participate in the war. The 'Times' correspondent also said that regardless of what decision Turkey makes, only one thing can be said with certainty: that Turkey can only continue to discuss this issue for a few more months. From this, it can be seen that the tense atmosphere between Britain and Turkey has not been alleviated and may become more tense in the coming weeks.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Preparing to Hold Diplomatic Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the Washington correspondent of the Swedish 'Aftonbladet', Britain and the United States are currently preparing for a diplomatic conference, which is likely to be held in the near future. The purpose of this conference is to establish a closer relationship between the British Foreign Office and the various departments of the US government, as the US departments' policies towards Germany sometimes fail to gain the support of the British Foreign Office, and London's support for the partition of Germany is currently greater than Washington's. The direct relationship between Churchill and Roosevelt is very good, but the leaders of the British Foreign Office and the various departments of the US government often disagree on current affairs issues.</p>
<h3>German Forces on Italian Front Using Gliding Bombs to Destroy Facilities in Anzio Harbor</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Italian front: German forces used gliding bombs to completely destroy the facilities in Anzio harbor.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced on the 27th that: anti-Axis forces attacked Anzio, but were met with concentrated fire from German defensive artillery. The enemy's attempt has been crushed. German long-range artillery units have shelled Anzio and Nettuno harbors and other enemy landing sites.</p>
<h3>New Polish Regime Established in Moscow; Commander-in-Chief of Polish Army Appointed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to the London 'Observer': the pro-Soviet Polish National Committee recently established in Moscow has appointed General Rola as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army.</p>
<p>Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency) - The German news agency, citing the 'London Observer', reports that the "Polish National Committee" recently established in Moscow has actually assumed the functions of the "secret Polish government." The first step in exercising its powers was to appoint another Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army to counter the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish government-in-exile in London. The "Polish National Committee" also issued a declaration promising "close cooperation with the Soviet Union and coordination with other anti-Axis countries," while also recognizing the Soviet Union's territorial claims against Poland. This development was also communicated to the Polish government-in-exile in London while Churchill was speaking in the House of Commons.</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Violates Airspace; Sweden Lodges Protest</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) - According to an official announcement today: the Swedish ambassador to the Soviet Union yesterday lodged a protest with the Soviet government regarding the Soviet aircraft flying over Swedish territory and dropping bombs on Stockholm.</p>
<h3>German Ship Breaks Blockade Line; Safely Returns Home from Japan</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (German News Agency) - The German merchant ship "Osoro No. 1", captained by Hermann, recently returned to Germany from Japan. He broke through the blockade line twice during the journey and has now been awarded the Iron Cross. While sailing through the China Sea, the ship was attacked twice by enemy submarines, but to no effect. According to a military officer on board, the ship suffered no damage entirely due to the captain's alert response. The ship was repeatedly ordered to stop by enemy aircraft in the South Atlantic, but the captain was able to disguise it as a British ship and manage the situation. Before receiving the protection of the German Navy, the ship used the same trick to break through the second blockade line. At that time, the ship was sailing off the British coast, but was able to escape the attention of enemy pilots. Furthermore, as the ship was sailing towards a German destroyer, it was attacked by a British Sunderland flying boat, but the flying boat was shot down before it could drop its bombs. It is unheard of for a small merchant ship to shoot down a large flying boat.</p>
<h3>The Conflict Between Roosevelt and Congress</h3>
<p>War does not tolerate domestic disputes, but in the United States, as the war intensifies, the home front is becoming increasingly chaotic and ununified due to the inherent contradictions within a democracy and the lack of a clear and just war aim. In particular, the recent political situation in the United States is in a state of turmoil due to the flaws in the Roosevelt government's war and domestic policies.</p>
<p>The US Congress, which is currently in session, fully reflects this unease. This situation in the 78th Congress will worsen in the presidential election in November of this year due to the fierce political struggle.</p>
<p>This reality of internal political strife and external fierce battles, even if the United States has a huge military force, may inevitably affect the practical aspects of the war. War and political strife are by no means unrelated matters.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and his party in the US government, who are responsible for this great war, are now facing this serious situation and are studying countermeasures to overcome this difficulty. The more serious the situation, the more anxious the countermeasures become. The intensification of Roosevelt's opposition to Congress since last year is a clear indication of this. Important bills proposed by Roosevelt are either rejected or amended, and no bill has been passed smoothly.</p>
<p>Five Important Bills</p>
<p>For example, on the 7th of this month, the House and Senate reduced the total amount of 10.5 billion yuan (totaling 15 billion yuan including social insurance contributions) requested by the government since last year to one-fifth, or 2.1 billion yuan. This reflects the will of the American people, who are suffering from high taxes and heavy burdens. In his New Year's address to Congress, Roosevelt proposed five important bills: (1) a realistic tax increase bill, (2) continuation of the wartime contract renegotiation law, (3) food price law, (4) extension of the economic stabilization law, and (5) enactment of the national service law. These are all "wartime measures," but the first one, the tax increase, was greatly reduced, which is Roosevelt's major failure in recent times. It is rumored that Roosevelt refused to sign the above-mentioned tax increase bill and sent it back to Congress. In short, it will become increasingly difficult for the US government, which needs 100 billion yuan in war expenses each year, to raise war funds in the future.</p>
<p>Secondly, in order to be elected in the presidential election in the autumn of this year, Roosevelt proposed a bill in Congress to allow soldiers on active duty to exercise their right to vote. The bill was debated in Congress last winter without reaching a conclusion. On the 4th of this month, the House of Representatives completely rejected the government's bill by a large margin of 328 votes to 69. The Senate amended it and passed it by a narrow margin of 46 to 40 on the 8th. Because the opposition in the House of Representatives is in the majority, the government is at a disadvantage even if a compromise is negotiated in a joint conference of the two houses in the future.</p>
<p>In the previous Congress, Roosevelt also encountered difficulties with the "father call-up bill" (a bill to call up fathers with children before the US entered the war) and the bill to prohibit food subsidies. The former, the government's bill was significantly amended and gradually passed. The latter, despite the government's opposition, passed in the House of Representatives. This is also one of the blows to Roosevelt's wartime measures.</p>
<p>The most important of these five bills is the national service bill. The opposition party, the Republican Party, the labor class, and various other parties have expressed strong opposition to this bill.</p>
<p>The content of the bill is that the state wants to forcibly conscript men from the ages of 18 to 60 and women from the ages of 18 to 50. The bill also attempts to prohibit all labor disputes, so the labor class has criticized and attacked it. Roosevelt said that the national service bill is not within the scope of politics, but the opposition party is using it as good material to attack the government.</p>
<p>The Power of the Opposition</p>
<p>In the US Congress, out of the total number of 435 seats in the House of Representatives, the Democratic Party has 218, the Republican Party has 209, the Progressive Party has 2, the Farmer-Labor Party has 1, the American Labor Party has 1, and there are 4 vacant seats. The majority occupied by the Democratic Party is only 4 seats. Moreover, there are many anti-government members within the Democratic Party, so in fact Roosevelt has lost the majority in the House of Representatives. Out of the total number of 96 seats in the Senate, the Democratic Party has 58, the Republican Party has 37, and the Progressive Party has 1. The Democratic Party occupies a majority of 20 seats, but in the deliberations on the tax increase bill, the soldier voting rights bill, and the father call-up bill, the anti-government forces in the Senate are also not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the unease in the US political situation, along with the intensification of the war and the accumulation of Roosevelt's domestic and foreign malpractices, will inevitably become more profound.</p>
<p>War and domestic political strife coexisting is the painful reality that the United States wants to settle but cannot settle. (By Koichi Takata, Deputy Chief of the Americas and Europe Department of the Mainichi Shimbun) (Transcribed from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 12th)</p>

<h3>United Rice Control Commission Urges Delivery of Rice to Shanghai; Food Supply Will Definitely Not Be Interrupted; 200,000 Bags Already Allocated in the Wuhu Area</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Recently, the price of rice on the black market in this city has soared. Upon investigation, the reasons are nothing more than the manipulation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants, spreading rumors, and inciting the people. Some say that after the distribution of household rice for this period, there will be no distribution for the next period. As a result, the general public, believing the rumors, often purchase and store as much rice as possible. The situation of hoarding in every household is increasing the price, making the situation even more tense. In order to understand the situation and its solution, this reporter visited the Rice Control Commission and related agencies yesterday. According to reliable information from all parties, it is known that the general public is too worried. Since the allocation of rice to Shanghai residents was increased from 2 liters per person per period, the food supply prospects have gradually become more optimistic. The Rice Control Commission has made concrete decisions regarding the future policy of procuring rice. They have requested the Executive Yuan to strictly punish and crack down on smuggling and manipulation of the national stock. At the same time, they have dispatched important officials to various rice-producing areas to urge the delivery of rice to Shanghai before the middle of this month. It is also known that 200,000 bags have already been allocated in the Wuhu area. There will definitely be no interruption in the food supply for Shanghai residents. It is hoped that the residents of this city will not lightly believe rumors and create unnecessary disturbances. It must be understood that competitive purchase of grain only serves to promote price increases. The public creates the cause of price increases and eats the rice at the increased price, only creating opportunities for a group of heartless people to become rich overnight.</p>
<h3>Financial Department to Severely Punish Firms That Purchase and Hoard Goods; Instructs Various Agencies to Conduct Serious Inspections</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: In order to prevent hoarding and eliminate speculation, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated three measures to restrict lending by financial institutions, which were circulated for compliance. Furthermore, the Shanghai Banking Association also drafted new lending measures, which were submitted and approved for implementation. However, over time, people became lax. According to reports, a general group of merchants are keen on hoarding goods, not a few of whom are overdrafting from banks to supplement their capital. Moreover, there are also some banks and money shops that are hoarding large quantities of goods with their own capital, which should be cracked down on. Therefore, instructions were issued to relevant agencies a few days ago to conduct thorough investigations. If it is found that various firms are indeed making loans to promote speculation, and are purchasing and hoarding goods themselves, they should be seriously reported to the Ministry for punishment.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Datong Academy Sightseeing Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: A group of 20 researchers from the Manchukuo Datong Academy arrived in Nanjing on the 25th of this month to see the current situation in China. They visited various Japanese agencies in China and attended receptions hosted by the Propaganda Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. They arrived in Shanghai under the leadership of Mr. Qi at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 28th) and are staying at the New Shanghai Hotel. Representatives from various agencies and organizations in the city who went to welcome them included: Director Liu of the Municipal Party Headquarters, represented by Li Raohan; Director Liang of the Municipal Propaganda Office, represented by Fang; Wu Pengfei, representative of the New Citizens' Movement Shanghai Branch; and Lang Yufei, representative of the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Association, and others totaling more than 20 people.</p>
<h3>Central Bank of China Revises Interbank Reserve Lending Method</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank's plan to use interbank deposit reserves as collateral for rediscounting was originally intended to adjust interbank positions temporarily. Now, various interbanks regard it as a normal discount lending method for working capital turnover, which is inconsistent with the original intention of providing emergency relief. The rediscounting method will now be revised as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The interbank will issue a promissory note and use the deposit reserve book as collateral for rediscounting at 50% of its value. Two interbanks will be required as guarantors (banks that are rediscounting may be guaranteed by one interbank).</p>
<p>2.  Rediscounting will not be allowed if the remaining deposit reserve is less than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>3.  The rediscounting period is at most 10 days. It must be collected upon maturity. If rediscounting is required again, it must be done one week later.</p>
<p>4.  The rediscounting rate is 1.2% per month. The above method will be implemented immediately. Letters have been sent to the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association to inform all member firms to comply.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops to Change Business Hours Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate customers' transactions, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank, as well as various commercial banks, money shops, and trust companies in the city, have decided to advance business hours by one hour starting tomorrow (March 1st). Monday to Friday: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Saturday: 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and closed in the afternoon as usual.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company to Revise Fares Again</h3>

Third class is divided into 1 yuan, 1.5 yuan, 2 yuan, and 3 yuan. Red buses start at 2.5 yuan, with a maximum of 5 yuan.</p>
<h3>First Police Bureau Conducts Citywide ID Card Checks Yesterday; Prevent Enemy Plots and Agitation</h3>
<p>With the assistance of military and police agencies, and the Second Police Bureau, the First Police Bureau conducted checks and interrogations of citizen identification cards (residence permits) throughout its jurisdiction yesterday (the 28th) from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. This check and interrogation was conducted suddenly to prevent enemy plots and agitation, as well as for general preventive purposes. They plan to hold it at any time as necessary. The authorities of the First Police Bureau hope that the general public will assist them in this implementation.</p>

After the book was published, buyers rushed to purchase it. Yesterday, he preemptively donated 10,000 yuan from the sale to the scholarship fund of this newspaper. Mr. Zhou's sympathy for those who have dropped out of school and his enthusiasm are admirable.</p>

<h3>Press Conference Between Chinese and Japanese Journalists: Hopes to Bring the Opinions of the Chinese Press Back to Japan</h3>
<p>Mr. Takaishi, President of the Allied Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, and a group of seven senior staff members of the company, returned from their inspection of the South, passing through Shanghai. To express our welcome, this newspaper hosted a simple and economical luncheon at the Holiday Wah Club yesterday at noon, inviting President Takaishi and others for a cordial gathering. At 5:00 PM that afternoon, President Takaishi hosted a return banquet for the Shanghai press and a press conference, held on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel. Attendees included President Takaishi, Managing Director Shikakura, Secretary-General Komatsu, Deputy Director of the East Asia Department Tachibana, Head of the Shanghai Branch of the Mainichi Shimbun Yokota, and senior staff members such as Morimoto, as well as Director Izubuchi of the Allied Japanese Army Information Department, Lieutenant Sakamoto, Trustee Akahoshi, Director Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department, Captain Shiota, Director Matsudaira of the Embassy Information Department, Investigator Mori, Vice Consul Fuku, and senior personnel from various Shanghai newspapers including the Shanghai Press Association, the Continental News, the Sin Wan Pao, the China Daily, the Ping Pao, the New China Daily, the Kuomin Hsin Pao, the Shun Pao, and this newspaper, totaling over thirty people, gathered together. At five o'clock, the press conference began.</p>
<p>Japanese People's Private Lives Have Been Suppressed to the Lowest Limit</p>
<p>Address by President Takaishi</p>
<p>He said in brief: "I am very pleased to have the honor of the presence of the Shanghai press today. One of the purposes of my trip to the South this time was to be entrusted by the Army and Navy authorities to inspect the preparations for establishing newspaper groups in various parts of the South. At today's press conference, I don't want to say much, but I would like to hear your opinions. However, I would like to briefly introduce the current situation in our country. In every aspect, our country takes winning the Greater East Asia War as its overall goal. The private lives of all citizens have been suppressed to the lowest limit, working hard and contributing all their strength to move towards the overall goal. To what extent and at what stage is our daily life suppressed? Perhaps you cannot imagine. At the same time, all citizens also hold the belief that the war will be won, because this war cannot be lost. If we fail, then the entire East Asia will perish. We all have this sense of alarm. The primary condition for war is productive power, especially military production and aircraft production. At present, the level of production in our country, according to numerical statistics, has reached an astonishing level. However, in order to ensure victory, we must further enrich our productive power. China is Japan's ally, so Japan sincerely hopes to be able to share the task. In any aspect, without the cooperation of your country, we will not succeed. You are all responsible persons in the press. It is my long-cherished wish to promote comprehensive common efforts through the joint efforts of the press, and I especially hope that you will realize this long-cherished wish together."</p>
<p>Please Freely Express Your Opinions for President Takaishi to Bring Back to Japan</p>
<p>Address by President Osaka</p>
<p>Following this, President Osaka of the Continental News delivered a speech, briefly stating: "President Takaishi holds a very important position in both the political and economic circles in Japan. Today, being able to meet and talk with colleagues from the Shanghai press is a convenient opportunity to report to the Japanese authorities, which is an even more meaningful opportunity. Now, please allow Mr. Xu Liqun and Mr. Chen Binhe to express their opinions." After the speech, an urgent telegram from the Japanese headquarters regarding the sinking of enemy ships in the Mariana Islands was delivered and immediately read aloud, and the entire room applauded.</p>
<p>Only by Firmly Believing in Victory Can the Goal of Victory Be Achieved</p>
<p>Address by Mr. Xu Liqun</p>
<p>"In the past, President Takaishi contributed greatly to the establishment of the Tripartite Alliance and the Sino-Japanese Alliance. I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak with him today. I completely agree with what President Takaishi said. From the beginning of this war, we have recognized that it is a long-term war, and the most important thing is to firmly believe in victory in order to win the final victory. However, we must know that no country in the world can succeed without sacrifice. Sacrifice is certainly painful, but in order to win victory, we must sacrifice. The progress and retreat of the war, the strategic dynamics that should be in place, cannot be predicted. Only by possessing the belief in victory can we achieve our goal. How is belief generated? First of all, the people and the government must cooperate. Allied Japan has done a great deal to help the National Government of Nanjing since its return to the capital, which is very appreciated. China, a country that is poor and weak, with countless problems, but I believe that the people and the government will definitely be able to cooperate and overcome difficulties. In wartime, a country must be united, whether in power or out of power. Last year, I participated in the Greater East Asia Press Conference and was very moved by the unified spirit of solidarity in Japan."</p>
<p>Cultural Coordination and Military Progress Make the Military Foundation Solid</p>
<p>Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper</p>
<p>He said in brief: "Thank you very much to President Takaishi for bringing a message of great victory. At the same time, I don't want to say polite words. I just want to ask President Takaishi to bring some opinions from our people back to your country. The most important mission of President Takaishi's trip to the South this time is to prepare to establish newspapers in important locations in the South. Everyone knows that Japan has already secured a military advantage in victory. However, if political and cultural aspects cannot progress equally and cannot coordinate with military progress, then the military foundation cannot be fully consolidated. When it comes to cultural progress, the press is the vanguard.</p>
<p>In the past, various parts of Nanyang were bases for British and American cultural aggression. This time, President Takaishi's plan to establish newspapers in the South is the most meaningful move from a cultural perspective. Here, I think of the many overseas Chinese from our country in various parts of Nanyang. I have three requests to ask President Takaishi to bring back to Tokyo:</p>
<p>First, the Nanyang cultural policy must take into account the overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Second, the Japanese military and political authorities in various parts of Nanyang should cooperate with the top-tier overseas Chinese in the area. They may have been driven by the British and Americans in the past. I hope that the Japanese authorities will no longer pursue past actions.</p>
<p>Third, I hope to assist Shanghai in transporting paper to Nanyang as quickly as possible so that overseas Chinese can read and understand the domestic situation.</p>
<p>Whoever Can Win the Hearts of the People Will Succeed</p>
<p>Secondly, we can foresee that the political construction problems in various parts of the South will be relatively easy to solve, and have been quite successful in the past year and a half. We believe that within the scope of Greater East Asia, the most difficult problem to solve is still the problem of China. Now, I will briefly talk about some Chinese problems.</p>
<p>Within China, there are currently three political forces that cannot be denied. The first is the National Government of Nanjing that we support. The second is the Chongqing regime that is being used by the enemy British and Americans. The third is the Communist Party, which is using Chongqing's war of attrition policy to expand its strength, deceive the people, and harm the motherland. Because education in China is not widespread, the people's level of knowledge is relatively low. To be honest, the general Chinese people do not yet have the ability to judge politics. In the people's perception, whoever can help solve the people's livelihood problems will win the hearts of the people. Now, these three political forces are competing with each other. Among these three political forces, the National Government of Nanjing is of course the most powerful objectively, governs the most people, and the area it governs is rich and abundant in products, as long as political innovation is carried out and efforts are made to solve the people's livelihood problems in a good way, it will definitely be supported by the entire people.</p>
<p>Anxious About the Price Problem in People's Livelihood</p>
<p>However, what is worrying is the most important price problem in the current people's livelihood. If the price index in 1936 is taken as the base 100, then the price index by the end of last year has increased more than 150 times. Several special prices have risen to 300 times or even 500 times. Today, the black market rice price in Shanghai has risen even more shockingly, and 70-80% of the population in Shanghai are salaried workers, with ordinary monthly salaries of only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, so when it comes to the people's livelihood problem, the difficulties have reached their extreme. If the people's livelihood problem cannot be solved, what construction? What cooperation? All become empty talk. Moreover, if the people's livelihood cannot be solved, not only can we not talk about construction or cooperation, but there is also a most serious hidden danger lurking.</p>
<p>Hidden Danger Must Be Carefully Noted</p>
<p>What is the hidden danger? It is the Communist Party. If your country is collapsing the strength of the British and American enemies day by day, if the strength of the Chinese Communist Party is expanding day by day, then the problem of Greater East Asia still cannot be solved satisfactorily. Therefore, I hope that the Japanese press predecessors will pay special attention to the people's livelihood problem in China. Standing in the position of colleagues, we hope that your press will pay attention to a few points:</p>
<p>Regarding news and materials about China, we hope that you will publish more in terms of quantity than now.</p>
<p>When publishing news and materials about China, do not focus too much on political news. Try to publish more news and materials about the people's livelihood problems and the people's dynamics in China.</p>
<p>The news and materials published must be accurate.</p>
<p>Chinese press employees, especially in Shanghai, really feel that their own strength is weak and their ability is insufficient. Therefore, I hope that the advanced Japanese press in the Allied countries will provide technical assistance.</p>
<p>I have talked with Captain Shiota that the current reporting and propaganda work should focus on the news of the Greater East Asia War. However, the news of the Greater East Asia War is published in great detail and vividly in the newspapers in Tokyo every time, while it is very brief in the newspapers in Shanghai. In fact, war news must be vivid and lively. If it is short and dry, the propaganda power will be reduced. According to this standard, it can be said that Chinese newspapers have not fulfilled their duties in reporting on the war in the past year. As far as our newspaper is concerned, we often translate and reprint from your country's newspapers a week or a few days later to supplement it. Secondly, important news from Tokyo can be published by the Shanghai Continental News the next day, while Chinese newspapers often publish it a day later. The reason is that the strength of the Central News Agency is insufficient. In terms of news reporting, I hope to help the Central News Agency strengthen its ability, and every time the war news is published, it should be as detailed and rapid as the news published in your country's newspapers.</p>
<p>Finally, we Chinese press colleagues should learn one thing from President Takaishi. We observe that President Takaishi looks like he is only in his fifties, but he is already 67 years old this year and has been serving in the press for 44 years. It is said that President Takaishi is good at sports and his golf skills are among the best in Japan, so he is very healthy. What we want to learn is his health. Only with health can we develop our careers."</p>
<p>Preemptive Strikes Reap Special Results</p>
<p>Address by Director Matsushima</p>
<p>Director Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department gave a speech before dinner, briefly stating: "Today, I will take the opportunity to explain the recent situation in the Pacific War to you. Since the enemy landed in the Marshall Islands, they have launched offensives many times, but they have all been repelled by the Japanese army. Although the enemy has declared defeat, they are still restless and are observing the enemy's target, which is just pointless sabotage. Recently, in the Mariana Islands area, the enemy's mobile unit, mainly composed of eight battleships and more than ten aircraft carriers, appeared in the waters east of the island. The Japanese naval air force immediately launched a fierce attack from the night of February 22nd to the dawn of February 23rd. As a result, one enemy aircraft carrier and three large battleships were sunk, and one aircraft carrier was severely damaged. Later, the enemy attacked Saipan and Tinian with 200 aircraft, and our side suffered minimal damage. The enemy's biggest failure is that after launching the offensive, they were discovered by the Japanese army, and they were immediately preemptively attacked with lightning speed, which always reaped special results. Today, thanks to President Takaishi, I can announce these extraordinary results."</p>
<p>After the speech, the banquet began. There was lively conversation, toasts, and laughter at the table. The grand gathering ended happily at around nine o'clock.</p>
<p>On February 20, Meiji 9 (1874), several judges from the Osaka High Court and the Osaka District Court, together with Mr. Kanzaki Heiya and Mr. Banri in Japan, published a newspaper in Osaka. Its format and style were the same as the newspapers issued in Tokyo, advocating civil rights theory. This was the predecessor of the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun."</p>
<p>In Meiji 14, the "Osaka Daily News" was bought by the Constitutional Political Party (a separate faction of the Liberal Party) organized by Mr. Kozawa and others. On February 1, Meiji 15, the first issue of "Japan Constitutional Political Party News" was launched. Soon, the Constitutional Political Party disbanded, and Mr. Heizu Kawazu took over the newspaper from Mr. Kozawa. In July, Meiji 18, it was transferred to Mr. Takatsugu Oka and Mr. Kenkichi Taguchi, and the name "Newspaper" was abolished. From September 1 of the same year, it was changed back to "</p>
<p>"Osaka Daily News." After this move, Mr. Takatsugu Oka left due to differing opinions. Mr. Taguchi and Mr. Fujiwara then transferred it to the Osaka tycoon Mr. Tomie Hayashida and Mr. Jiro Matsubusa and Mr. Shinzo Kuwabara, with Mr. Jun Yano serving as the company affairs. The old employees resigned together. On November 20, the "Osaka Daily News" was renamed "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun." Mr. Osamu Watanabe and Mr. Kiichiro Takagi successively served as presidents, laying the foundation for its development. In Meiji 30, Mr. Kei Hara joined the company, and its reputation increased. In Meiji 33, Mr. Eitaro Komatsubara took over. In Meiji 36, he resigned due to illness, and Mr. Hikoichi Motoyama succeeded as president for 30 years. In December, Meiji 39, he bought the "Tokyo Telegraph News" and renamed it "Mainichi Telegraph." In Meiji 43, he further bought the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" with a capital of 500,000 yen, and merged "Mainichi Telegraph." From February 1, Meiji 44, it continued to be issued under the name "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun," and its business grew steadily. More than ten years later, its reputation and sales ranked first in Tokyo.</p>
<p>In March, Taisho 11, the new Osaka headquarters building was completed, and the interior was specially designed. On April 12, Taisho 11, the "English Mainichi" was issued. On May 11, Taisho 11, a Braille weekly for the blind was issued. On April 2, the "Weekly Mainichi" was issued, actively expanding its business. On November 5, Taisho 11, the new building of the "Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun" was completed.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun designates the founding day of the "Constitutional Women's Party News" as its anniversary. Counting from that day, this year is its 62nd year. During this period, the newspaper has grown from a joint venture company with a capital of 50,000 yen to a joint-stock company with a capital of 10 million yen, with its capital increasing 200 times. Initially, the sales volume was only a few thousand, but recently it has exceeded 2.5 million. The number of pages has increased from four to sixteen (currently still four pages due to paper saving). The old and incomplete hand-operated printing presses have been replaced with rotary printing presses that can print 120,000 copies per hour, the fastest speed in the world.</p>
<p>In Showa 7, Mr. Motoyama passed away due to illness. Since then, a board of directors system has been adopted, with Mr. Minoru Oka as chairman. In December, Showa 11, Mr. Shintaro Okumura took office as chairman, and Mr. Shingo Takaishi was appointed as editor-in-chief. In September, Showa 13, Mr. Shingo Takaishi took office as chairman of the board of directors. Its accuracy of records and breadth of sales have long been well-established. It is now one of the three major newspapers after the reorganization and integration of the Japanese press. (The three major newspapers are Asahi Shimbun, Mainichi Shimbun, and Yomiuri Hochi).</p>
<p>List of Guests at This Newspaper's Banquet</p>
<p>The main guests at this newspaper's banquet yesterday noon were President Takaishi, Managing Director Shikakura, Secretary-General Komatsu, Deputy Director of the Kuruma Asia Department Tachibana, Branch Manager Yokota, and Deputy Director Morimoto.

<h3>National Forum: Rationalizing Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Epidemic prevention policies must be strengthened, but they must first be rationalized. I will review the current system and then seek ways to improve it for the reference of the health authorities. Vaccination: Smallpox is fundamentally a childhood disease. It is rare to encounter an adult patient, and one vaccination can provide immunity for many years. Therefore, there is no need to revaccinate every year. Furthermore, there are no regulations in the country's health laws that require two vaccinations per year. However, this is not the case in our country. Taking Shanghai as an example, it has been widely vaccinated twice last spring and autumn, and preparations are now being made to hold it again, with regulations on smallpox vaccination certificates. However, vaccination is not without contraindications. Many people with serious chronic diseases can develop post-vaccination encephalitis, Encepholite Post Vaccinale, which is a common fact. This is the first irrationality.</p>
<p>Epidemic Prevention Injections: Epidemic prevention injections are not absolutely without contraindications. Those with fever are not suitable for injection, those suspected of having acute diseases are not suitable for injection, and others such as those with progressive tuberculosis, myocarditis, nephritis with proteinuria, hematuria, diabetes, stomach ulcers, beriberi, the elderly, the frail, and pregnant women are not suitable for injection. Our country is known as the sick man of Asia, and there must be many hidden patients. How can there not be some sacrifices among the millions of people who are universally vaccinated? Moreover, epidemic prevention injections must be given in gradually increasing doses and three injections are required for immunity. Now, injections are forcibly given on the road, and certificates are given after one injection. Is this effective? This is the second irrationality.</p>
<p>Based on the above, it can be seen that epidemic prevention policies must be carried out with caution and cannot be implemented rashly. In particular, it is necessary to cooperate with private doctors in order to achieve beneficial and harmless results. The public must first consult a doctor. Those who are healthy are fine, but those with serious hidden diseases can obtain a contraindication certificate to be exempted from vaccination and injections. Vaccination certificates are valid for five years (except during the time when smallpox is rampant). Vaccination orders can be held every year, but those who have already been vaccinated do not need to revaccinate every year. In this way, epidemic prevention policies can be promoted without hindrance, and the health of the public will not be slightly affected.</p>

<p>On Military Academies (2)</p>
<p>Written by Navy Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>This school differs from ordinary schools. It is filled with a spirit that other schools do not have. Furthermore, it is not the same as a school or dojo; it absolutely does not adopt the guidance and development of the student's individual personality and character as its educational policy. At the same time, it harmonizes and emphasizes both spirit and science, without leaning towards one side. It gives students a great deal of time and equipment to study scientific learning. This is where this school differs from monasteries or dojos. Whether to emphasize moral education or intellectual education is the problem of other schools. In short, military academies are special schools. Perhaps it can be said that they are true schools. In this rigorous school, an autonomous system is implemented, and the spirit of self-discipline is advocated—saying this may lead some people to doubt. Autonomy, self-discipline, and self-reliance have been the traditional spirit of this school for seventy years.</p>
<p>The friendship of classmates who share life and death is a strong bond. The division system in the school is a vertical bond. Both originate from this tradition. Each division of more than forty people, with upperclassmen as the center, leads an autonomous life. Among the students, military regulations, discipline, tradition, and glory are permanently preserved. "For the sake of the division's reputation," students must compete to win, must examine their own bodies and minds, and must maintain order. The division system, in which upperclassmen and lowerclassmen are mixed together, is indeed a wise measure. The instructors merely supervise from the side with deep love and attention.</p>
<p>The military academy is like a fleet, and the division is like a warship. The division acts autonomously, and is integrated into a large command.</p>
<p>Therefore, the difference between upperclassmen and lowerclassmen in this school has characteristics that are not seen elsewhere. It is not only because they are upperclassmen that they are great; in reality, upperclassmen are great. This is due to the length of training. For example, in spring and autumn, men and women who come to visit the military academy line up like walls from Wu City or Hiroshima. The attitude of fourth-year students, although they can also calm themselves and pretend nothing is happening, is never like that of first-year students, who are like watching the wind direction, never moving a muscle. The distinction between senior and junior monks practicing in a Zen temple can also be seen at a glance here. The navy slang of calling the world "the secular world" is indeed a very interesting term, and it can also be expressed in this context.</p>
<p>In this school, the most repulsive thing is a feminine, weak attitude. That is not limited to maintaining the belief of certain victory. When studying, study hard; when playing, play hard—this concentration, this act of will and reason, ultimately leads to a masculine, self-disciplined attitude. Clever excuses are a feminine attitude. Striving to the end with all one's physical and mental strength, straightening one's clothes and appearance, are all manifestations of true masculine characteristics.</p>

<h3>Review of Meningitis Treatment: Patients Must Not Misuse Herbal Remedies</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been discussion about methods for treating meningitis. However, this disease comes on quickly, and life and death are reversed in an instant. Delaying treatment means missing the opportunity for a cure. Therefore, the public release of herbal remedies must be approached with caution from the beginning. The methods of blowing dried tree resin into the nose and the Nie's two prescriptions are said to have special effects. Who can believe it? Occasional occurrences are not uncommon, but to consider them certain is there any truth to it? Those who use meningitis serum treatment have mixed success, and some have aftereffects such as dementia and paralysis. Recently, with the newly invented drug, Sujphaupridin should be considered the most effective. Delaying treatment even slightly will certainly endanger life and it has a success rate of over 70 to 80 percent with no aftereffects. There are many products of this drug, with different names from each pharmaceutical factory, and they can all be purchased in pharmacies. Therefore, such acute infectious diseases should be handled by a certified physician. (Song Daren)</p>
<p>(Note: The epidemic of meningitis in this city has been quite rampant since the beginning of spring, affecting over a hundred people, especially children. The obvious signs are fever, clouding of consciousness, headache, vomiting, delirium, and stiffness in the back of the head. Patients should go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible, otherwise the loss of life is a certainty.)</p>
<h3>Free Smallpox Vaccination at the Chinese Hospital</h3>
<p>The Chinese Hospital is now offering free smallpox vaccinations for the spring season. People from all walks of life can contact the hospital for vaccination. The main hospital is located at 32 Changyang Road (formerly Ward Road), and the branch hospital is at 251 Xinzha Road.</p>
<h3>Should I Starve to Death?</h3>
<p>— Ms. Zeng Hejing</p>
<p>Since I lost my job on December 8th of last year, my family's finances have faced an extreme crisis. Three school-age children (eleven, nine, and eight years old) and two long-term patients (husband and young daughter) make this life more than the body can handle. Given my previous position, I had the opportunity to at least keep my family warm and fed, but I only wanted to live honestly and arduously, unwilling to take money that went against my conscience, so my children's right to survival could not be guaranteed. I have tried hard to save money and economize, but even a clever woman cannot cook without rice. Seeing hunger and cold approaching, the tuition fees for my three children—over two thousand dollars—are even more out of reach. My family still has more than forty pieces of calligraphy and paintings, both ancient and modern, many of which are valuable works, but in the hands of a poor scholar, I cannot sell them for a reasonable price. I do not want to use hardship and integrity as a pretext to increase the value of my goods. I only ask those with a true artistic eye within the country to give me a fair price, which is the basis for my struggle against overwhelming pressure. A list of the calligraphy and paintings is kept at the Social Services Department of the Shen Bao.</p>
