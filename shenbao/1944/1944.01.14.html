<h3>決戰在目前</h3>
<p>本年一月九日，爲中國參加大東亞戰爭之一週紀念，是日官民各界情緒至爲緊張，就各處所張貼之標語而言，已足以使一般業衆感到戰事之白熱化。其中之「决戰在目前」一語，尤令人了悟目前所處之環境，乃整個東亞前途之緊要關頭。</p>
<p>就「决戰」二字之意義着想，一方面就是戰事到了決勝負的時機，亦即戰事到了最猛烈的階段。第二方面就是說戰事決了勝負，亦便可以結東而恢復和平狀態。於是乎便要研究如何處此「決戰在目前」的環境，以適合現實的需要，準備將來的建設。</p>
<p>中國參加大東亞戰爭，雖僅一年，可是，處於戰爭狀態者，己將七載。在參加大東亞戰爭之後，在物資上雖不無貢獻，但就參戰整個義務以言，所做者仍多屬於搖旗吶喊工作。而且後方的社會現象，却未能達到負戰爭使命的民族所應有之程度，這是很顯明的事實。上海是後方重鎭之一，試間上海所給與戰爭的影響爲何如？試問其他後方各城各市的情形又何如？一書以蔽之，不外黑暗與墮落。豈有以黑喑與墮落的兩種態度，足以應付現代最高峯之戰爭？然而，大東亞戰爭業已奠定必勝基礎，迨勝利以後，吾人將何以居其功？若不趁此「决戰在目前」之日，將後方嚴加整飭，則一且於紊亂之中，中國竟被視爲戰勝國之一，屆時吾人必將面面相覰，不知自處。</p>
<p>在這七年之中，革除戰前弊病之處固非絕無，可是因循沿襲，甚至變本加厲者亦復不少。戰前中國已是工業落伍的國家，戰後粉紛停頓，在他人先天旣足，而又復利甩戰爭過程加以科學化合理化的整頓，埋頭苦幹的工作，在各方面都更有長足的進展。例如德國在一九四二年一年之中所登記之專利執照，竟達五萬三千件之多，（見壁恒圖書公司出版之「德國簡訊」）已可見一斑。此次戰事終了以後，中國姑不論其如何取勝，終必以束亞一員之資格，謀東亞共存共榮之道。若不趁此「决戰在目前」之日，先努力於掃蕩重業之積弊，保存民間之元氣，樹立最少限度之建設方面的基礎，確立種種事業上之方案，則無以補亡羊之牢，將來措手不及，其何以達成我中華民族應負之使命。「决戰在目前」，「决戰在目前」！</p>

<p>南京十三日中央社電　國府公佈戰時物價管理暫行條例，陳實業部長發表談話：物價管理為戰時經濟之中心問題，政府對此向即慎審研討，以期得有合理之解决，關於物價穩定之根本對策，諸如增加生產，疏通來源，改善配給，節約消費等，業經擬定積極推進方案，不日付之實施。至物價本身之管理，尤須切合時勢，力求完備，以前施行種種物價管理法規，原爲臨時措置，環境遽變，不能不加改訂，此次公佈之戰時物價管理暫行條例，即本斯旨修正施行者，茲將內容要點，略舉於下，各當地主管官署，會同有關機關，組織物價評議委員會，期能因地制宜，關係方面及商業團體，俱得參加，藉使物價評議，發揮偉大之效力。應行評價之物資品目，先以日用必需品爲限，以免種類繁多，無從顧及，且期嚴切執行，以符安定民生之目的。其他物費當地經濟局得斟酌情形，擬定品”，由同業公會協定適當價格，共同遵守，無論公定價格或協定價格，各同業公會對會員俱應負責督導，藉以發揚商界自治之精神。此外合法利潤亦經規定標準，俾各地評價不致發生參差之現象，再購買評定價格物資，不得招過限額，以免乘機競爭，滅少供給數　。總之，本條例之主旨，在以經濟周爲中心，促進各地同業公會之自治，以公允爲原則，使戰時物價穩定於適當之範圍，惟此最關重要而異常複雜，旦與民生安定具有密切關係之物價問題，非上下協力，不能得有解决之途徑，尙望各經濟局密切聯絡，使各地物價變動保持均衡狀態，一致負起物價管理之賣任，同業公會督導會員，嚴格遵守政府之命令，一般民衆應認淸環境，協助推進管理施策，如有舉行不力，仍希囤積居奇貪圖暴利者，則法令具在。决不寬貸。</p>

<h3>日首相闡明軍需生產重點　將置於增强航空戰力</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電日東條兼軍需相，於第一次軍需監理部長會犧第二日（十三日）之席上曾致淵辭，指明軍審監理部之重要使命，在推進並指導以增產數倍飛機爲中心之軍需生產。並就軍需生產行政機關之服務要點舉出三項如次：　須使軍需生產之重點專置於增強航空戰力，期使之滲透於生產方面。　指導生產充分發揮奮門情神。　認識生產實際情形，努力綜合發揮生產能力。</p>
<h3>盤谷市街被炸泰首相廣播　指出英美之慘暴性格</h3>
<p>盤谷十三日中央社電　美機曾於十日夜來製盤谷，在市內西北部投下炸彈，燒夷彈多枚，然損害極輕，十二日夜美機復來襲盤炸市內中部之寺院及街市，兩次來襲之美機，經日。泰兩軍及防空砲火猛轟後，立即遁走。泰首相畢本特於十二日夜向國人廣播，指出英美之慘暴，其大意謂：此次美機所投之炸彈，大部均屬燒夷彈，致市民財產略有損失，泰國國民於此已獲悉英。美殘暴之性格矣。蓋英。美　於以正當戰鬥手段决難獲勝，故對我國施行盲炸，吾人試觀世界戰局，如義大利戰綫英。美軍毫無進展，歐洲第二戰綫亦未能開闢，至於太平洋戰綫，英。美亦無任何令人注意之進展，僅在海上孤島　動而巳。然此等小島並無何　重要，因此，英。美乃轉移目光，注意泰國，室襲盤谷，並令彼等宣傳機關向世界作虛僞宣傳謂，「美機日咋空襲盤谷，投下炸彈多枚，敵軍幾未交戰，美機之空襲盤谷，易如打高爾夫球」，殊不知此種殘暴手段，决難獲得最後勝利，彼等今旣破壞吾人寺院及和平設施，則必有一日遭受因果之報應也。</p>
<h3>美強迫工役案國內反對聲</h3>
<p>百倫十三日中央社電　據　盛頓消息：羅斯福總統所宣怖之國民服務律與强迫工役議案，已提交參衆兩院。該案規定除若干特別例外之外，凡年在十八歲至六十歲簡之男子與十八歲至四十九歲聞之女子均須服役，至於願否加入任何工會，則將由人民自决。據悉，美工會領袖格林與茂萊，會於星期三被　與羅斯福總統討論該　案，茂萊宣稱，一對於該議案將大起反對。</p>
<h3>緬改革地方行政全國劃爲四區　勞力資源運營使科學化</h3>
<p>緬甸十三日中央社電　緬甸政府於十二日發表緬甸政府為根據新秩序建設計劃之精神，促進行政效率起見，最近曾在上下緬甸兩地域分別召開地方長官會議，政府官員多出席，就各種重要問題舉行協議，事後巴莫國家代表即决定將緬甸行政地區劃爲三區，分別任命各地區長官，今後各縣長官除與完成戰爭建設新秩序有直接影響之重要案件外，可不必接奉中央命令直接與地區長官協議，傳迅速處理。又此次地方行政改　後，緬甸劃分爲上中下之行政地區，連同掉部地區共為四行政地區。茲誌各新設地區所屬縣分及地區官廳所在地如次：　上緬甸地區管轄區五縣，官廳設於瓦城。　中緬甸地區管轄八縣，官廳設於巴森。　下緬甸地區管轄區三縣，官廳設於仰光。</p>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電　緬甸政府于十二日發表决定，改革地方行政　構後，緬甸巴莫國家代表，爲此特發表談話，大旨謂：此次政府决定改革地方行政機構，其目的係謀緬甸豐富之勞力物資之營運等，均能高度科學化，積極動員人力及物力資源，發揮其高度能率。緣編甸過去在英國統治之下，物資與勞力運營之不平衡已達極點，上細甸方面物責少而勞動力多，過去英國雖使上緬甸之勞動力移于緬甸河古泓積地帶，但因其基于榨取緬甸之用，致完全失敗，因此採取印人勞動移民策，至今仍留有禍根。吾人現依據科學，决定方針，以免重蹈舊轍，凡在上緬甸境內於間一風奮同一風土之範圍內，使有無相通，因此雖在運輸困難之今日，其對民生將有裨益，</p>

<p>南京十三日中央社電第一次全國兵器會議於十三日上午十時四十九分揭幕後，即於下午三時舉行第一次會議，會議完畢後即分三組舉行審查全部提案。</p>
<h3>汪委員長訓詞</h3>
<p>南京十三日中央社電軍委會汪委員長（鮑總參謀長代）於第一次全國兵器會議揭幕致訓如左：舉今天本會兵器調整委員會召集各軍事機關部隊學校管理軍械人員在首都舉行第一次全國兵器會議，意義極爲重大，本委員長以公務繁冗，不遑蒞臨參與其盛，特派總謀參長鮑文越代爲致訓武器爲軍人第二生命，載在軍人信條，凡我軍人所當共喻，蓋武器之良　，所關於軍隊之强弱，國家之盛表者，至重且鉅，此兵器會議之所由召集，並希望諸君詳加研討，悉心擘畫，以期有所助益。</p>
<p>陸軍部爲全國兵器行政之主管機關，平日規畫，不遣餘力，更鑒於現在各部隊武器種類繁多，口徑不一，於作戰補充上困難綦多，因又有兵器調整委員曾之設立，集中陸軍部及修械所之力量，以謀槍種口徑之劃一，殘缺破壞武器之修理，在中央固已盡其最大努力，積極調整補充，在各部隊尤應仰體時艱，對所有武器極盡愛護之能事，妥爲保管，以担當此現時代　大使命。倘敢玩忽功令，甚或有盜賣軍火情事，須知國法所在，决不寬假，以儆有衆。</p>
<p>次東亞戰爭力酣之際，確保治安乃我軍人唯一使命，惟欲確保治安，亟應充實實力，亟應愛護武器，欲愛護武器，亟應養成軍械人才，故平日對於武器之保管方法，應如何講求探討，製造修理人才，應如何延攬造就，尤須特別注意，預爲之備。</p>
<p>國府還都以來，所有軍事計畫之推進，武器彈藥之補充等，備承友邦種種援助，吾人於感謝之餘，尤應體念此非常時期物力維艱，特別愛護，以無負殷殷屬望之至意，其各勉旃，</p>

<h3>基洛伏區成為東線大戰中心　薩爾尼爭奪戰劇烈</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電海通社訊：東錢戰事焦點現仍在基洛伏格勒區。蘇軍現正向烏克蘭西部鐵道要衝藤爾尼進攻，劇戰正在進行中。克里米亞橋頭及刻赤以北亦有惡戰。</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電海通社訊。：過去二十四小時中，東綫攻勢重心所在地之克里米亞信維特勃斯克以北兩處，戰事愈演愈烈。寇許之東北，敵於日前以步兵數師，輔以大批飛機大砲猛犯未逞。大聶伯河套，蘇軍來自尼普貝特羅夫斯克之壓力未減，但亦未有成就。基洛伏格勒蘇軍源源開到，德軍亦反攻不已。契爾喀塞之西南，劇戰動盪不定，尤以波格里希期之東南及西南一帶，戰綫益參差不一，該處有蘇步兵一師坦克車一旅砲兵一隊被切斷，並遭殲滅。貝迪契夫之西及諾伏格勒伏林斯克之西僅有局部小戰。勒契薩之西，敵在數處突入德陣綫，維特勃斯克區敵竟日猛攻未逞。</p>
<p>柏林十三中央社電海通社訊，德軍界方面昨晚得前綫最後息：過去四十八小時來。蘇軍自寇許東北橋頭甫覆發動之進攻。毫無進展。據德方估計，蘇軍集中大軍四五師團以備進攻惟蘇軍干不但不能擴大其據點，若干區域且被包圍。</p>
<h3>義大利南部攻防戰熾烈</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德元首行營十二日發表：南義戰綫維納弗洛西方繼續有熾烈防禦戰，德軍於柴爾哇及該市東北高地與敵軍激戰後即行撤退</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　海通社訊：美軍於星一期一又開始進攻扼守卡西諾平原及里利山谷之德軍山間陣地，戰事重心，在塞伐洛、維蒂古索一帶，然卡西諾。米納諾公路以南亦被波及。敵軍於星期一猛攻結果，僅在塞伐洛附近之一點突入德陣錢，至翌日美軍又大事增援企一圖擴大之猛攻後，始佔領塞伐洛東北之山脊一座。德軍梯形陣綫極利防守，猶憶美軍於十一月六日佔領維納弗洛後，即向伏爾托諾河上游推進，其戰綫長不逾二十五公里，然而進攻十星期餘，仍不能突至卡西諾，由此可知英美戰略之愚拙矣。</p>

<h3>德空軍勇敢邀擊獲偉大戰果　美機襲德喪失二之一</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　德軍十一日曾在德國西北部擊落美轟炸機百卅六架。</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電　據倫敦來電，美第八空軍機隊司令部十二日發表：美軍十一日以空中堡壘及重轟炸機七百餘架，於雷型機及閃電式戰鬥機之護衛下，空襲德西北部，但德軍防衛極其堅固，故展開猛烈空戰，是役美四引擎轟炸機五十九架及戰鬥五架未歸返根據。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電　美軍長距離　炸機隊，十一日上午於戰門機　護下，曾轟炸德中部哈雷及馬格德堡德騷等方面之工業地帶，德軍以戰門機大福隊勇敢邀擊，致收獲空前之偉大戰果。按美空軍於去年十月轟炸西衛因佛而德之際，已遭受德空軍火箭砲彈之猛烈射擊。而隨成喪失重轟炸機百廿　之慘敗，然彼等仍未認清德軍之防空威力，當新轟炸機隊司令多里托魯就任後，遂又强行此次襲擊空中堡壘及統一式四發重轟烽機三百架以上之大編　，在雷天時長距離戰門百架以上掩護下，企　深入德領土實行猛炸，然據器之威力愈益增大，</p>

<h3>戰時德國後方生活　婦女加入生產陣容</h3>
<p>外務省二等書記官牛塲信彥氏自一九三三年國社黨政權上台時起，服務柏林大使館前後共六年半，於十一月十三日從柏林出發，與駐洪牙利公使大久保一同經土耳其蘇聯歸國，二十六日到達哈爾濱，談最近務國國民的　結　堅的情形如次，打破了對盟邦德國的煽動宣傳，並掃除了對歐洲情勢的不安。</p>
<h3>食糧毫無不安</h3>
<p>德國的國民生活並無何等不安，物價政策堪爲全世界的模範，比起貨幣數量來，物資方面並不充分，但完全抑制了通貨膨脹，全世界均爲之驚異。說到食糧，歐洲今年是豐年，所以毫無不安。因爲拋棄了烏克蘭而恐怕不足的看法是錯的，烏克蘭產出的農作物，祇供當地軍隊的需要。且德軍所希望的，也以特尼泊爾河以西的農產物爲主，所以縱使德軍完全喪失了烏克蘭，也毫無影響，從德國全部的食糧來君鳥克　，眞是微乎其微。</p>
<p>有人以美軍的轟炸普洛愛斯蒂油田（羅馬尼亞）爲問題。普洛愛斯蒂祇有在本年春季被美機轟炸一次，此後即不見繼續轟炸，可知羅馬尼亞的轟炸在技術上是非常困難的。且普洛愛斯蒂的製油能力，現在有一倍半至二倍，所以祖心羅馬尼亞油田完全是不必的。</p>
<p>物價政策有似奇蹟般進行極爲滿意，日用物資的配給也極順利，從這些地方看，我們不以爲會引起德國內部的崩潰的。牛肉的配給略見减少，但如麵包最近四週增至十公斤，馬鈴著等也每週增配三公斤至三公斤半，這數字是對一般市民的最低配給量，苦力勞慟者受着這一倍半到三倍的配給。</p>
<p>勞慟者又分爲最苦力勞慟者，苦力勞慟者及長時間勞慟者三種，各有特殊的配給。</p>
<h3>推行適當政策</h3>
<p>國社當極為穩固，國社主義與國民完全融合起來，把國社主　與國民區別起來看的思想屬於陳舊的觀念。今日德國的能够遂行那樣大規模的戰爭實因國社主義的地盤及組織已經確立，且運用適當。極似日本的隣組的發展，空襲之後，黨的別動隊NSV（國民福祉團）承辦一切工作，自燒飯以至於衣服的補給，且這組織遍佈全國各地。</p>
<p>在德國最堪注目的是靑年敎育和社會政策。這二者在聯繫後方上盡着很大的任務。納粹所獨有的希特勒。優根德教育到現在其效果也顯然可見。在　根特教育上，貫徹規律，義務服從，減私奉公等精神，是極偉大的，優根特的軍事教練在今日的戰爭上也的重大的　　。勞動服務組織方面，全體國民無　富的區別。燃起了同胞意識。社會政策的根本，把以前已有的失業，災害等社會保險制度為基護。自從突入戰爭以後的社會政策更可驚異，爲了勞慟常的努力。（翔：譯自十二月三十日東京朝日新聞）</p>

<p>廣田情報部長評羅斯福咨文　美人力缺乏已可窺見</p>
<p>中央社訊　日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長，於昨日下午三時，在定例報道常會席上，就本月十一日美總統羅斯福向國會所提之咨文，特加以批評。</p>
<p>誇誕宣傳前後矛盾</p>
<p>廣田部長首指出該咨文之要點內容；　美國第二次增產計劃，　保障國內生活安定。繼謂羅總統此次向國會內外所提之增產宣傳情形，我人莫不認爲奇觀。查　總統往昔在宣傳時，恒　美國生產力量絕無限制，尤共軍火生產等，如天文學之數量無異，再如德黑蘭會　以後，美英蘇揄反軸心之作戰計劃，復稱已吿完成，：並謂即將實行云，是以羅總統往昔之誇大聲明，於此次國會席上所提咨文上，我人對美國內情形，不難窺見一斑。故我人對美國此次亟需增產，異常驚奇，以往之所謂美無限生產力量，等於一軍人赴前綫未携槍械，慌張莫名，前後矛盾。按之反軸心之展開大規模宣傳原因，實由於彼輩之準備不够，尤其羅總統所提之咨文上，又言徵用國民律，原擬在本到此項目的起見，欲維持一個軍隊遣駐海外，須有十個勞慟者之服務，即使能得實現，需費數千萬之人力，故美國則在國內之人力更屬不够，而在增產事業上，當遭遇極大困難，從此點而觀，已足見美人力缺乏，是可斷言者。</p>
<p>美之攻勢漸趨衰退</p>
<p>南用太平洋况，謂美國之攻勢。巳漸趨衰退，且在歐洲方面集中第二戰綫計劃，毫無正式進行，其最大原因，實由於美國內生產力量減退，故羅總統主張在第三年作戰之開始，於國會席上咨文提出保障國內生活安定，及警吿一般國民，與國內分裂派，全國應緊密團結，從此又可證明美國內分裂情形，空氣相當邊厚。美國民衆並對羅所發起之無意義世界戰爭，表示反感，此項情形，日見猛烈。關於加强生產，征用人力之兩提案，　信美國民將有更强烈之反對，以是羅總統爲預防國民之反對，特作上述之要求緊密團結。本來政府所採用之政策，國民當具有重大敏感，予以接受，無庸向國民請求，故對羅總統之政策，國民之接受與否，寶有頗大之疑問。此外　之所提咨文原因，第一實由於日德兩國及其他軸心各國之堅强　結，且生產力量廠大，是以羅頗爲憂慮，乃不能不耍求國民團結。以加强生產而救危急。第二羅總統及其他各反軸心之領導者，爲謀擎敗日德兩國之企圖，奸詐百出，查彼輩之企圖，不啻爲紙上談兵，在實行上當爲不可能，我人可以過去情形作例檢討，則此次所謂增產團結，其力量，顯見微弱，其效果實等於廢紙云云。</p>

<h3>申報六屆助學金熱望繼績捐輸　李始吾先生昨捐贈十萬元</h3>
<p>第六屆申報讀者助學金，發動以來，　各界熱烈響應，踴躍捐輸，至深感奮，惟查本屆甲請之學生人數，達一萬六千餘名之多，開歷屆申請人數之新紀錄，本屆助學金德額，原定目標爲三百萬元，以平均每人補助五百元計算，亦僅能資助六于八。尙有半數以上學生勢將不能獲助，更何况現有之助金，僅二百餘萬之數，同等實有難以分配之感，盼望各界人士，鑒於待助學生之衆多，捐款之不敷，慨解仁囊，於本人捐助以外，並轉動親友，共喪義舉幸甚。</p>
<p>李始吾氏捐十萬元</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>從三個角度來看</h3>
<p>華商證券交易所奉令複業開柏華商股票以來，均以隔日交割現貨爲主，中問雖曾一度計議改爲一星期交割制度，終因輿論一致認爲足以助長投機操縱，而有關當局亦復認爲有嚴重考慮之必要故迄今仍以現買期買賣為原則：最近因各經紀人之　求，復有實施現貸便交之議，且有於一月　一日紅盤交易開市時實施之說，所以我們願繼去年十一月廿三日所論便交問題之後，再從三個不同的角度來看一看證券交易的前程。</p>
<p>這三個角度是什麼？就是　證券交易所，　經紀人，　買賣股票的公衆。一星期交割制實施而後，蹬券交易所的利益是益由於成交數額之膨脹，可以向經紀人收取更多之手續費；經紀人的利益是：可以從容處理紛繁綜錯的交割事宜，同時，可向顧客徵收更多之手續費；買賣股禀公衆的利益是：繳納少數之保證金，可以買寶大量之股票。以上三個角度所獲得的利益，彼此雖然有些不同，可是，其爲利益則同，祇是這樣一來，今後的股票市塲，是不是能够做到，「海不揚波」：恐怕　也不敢斷定了！假定是不能够的話證券交易所尙能根據其「營業細則」第十二章來上一個「制裁」，經紀人尙可以做到「愛之欲其生，惡之欲其死，」惟有育目買賣股票的男女公衆，旣毫無控制任何環境之能力，假定一味以賭博方法來做股票的話，其結果必然不出兩途，一爲發橫財，一爲投黃浦？所以，今後若有不以股票爲投資而以之爲投機的對象者，可不愼歟？</p>

<h3>Decisive Battle Imminent</h3>
<p>January 9th of this year marked the first anniversary of China's participation in the Greater East Asia War. On this day, the mood of officials and civilians from all walks of life was extremely tense. Judging from the slogans posted everywhere, it was enough to make the general public feel the intensification of the war. Among them, the phrase "Decisive battle imminent" especially made people understand that the current environment is a critical juncture for the entire future of East Asia.</p>
<p>Considering the meaning of the word "decisive battle," on the one hand, it means that the war has reached the time to determine the outcome, that is, the war has reached the most intense stage. On the other hand, it means that once the war determines the victory or defeat, it can be ended and a state of peace can be restored. Therefore, it is necessary to study how to deal with the environment of "decisive battle imminent" to meet the needs of reality and prepare for future construction.</p>
<p>Although China has only participated in the Greater East Asia War for one year, it has been in a state of war for seven years. After participating in the Greater East Asia War, although it has made some contributions in terms of materials, in terms of the entire obligation of participating in the war, what it has done is still mostly flag-waving and cheering. Moreover, the social phenomena in the rear have not reached the level that a nation bearing the mission of war should have, which is a very obvious fact. Shanghai is one of the important towns in the rear. What is the impact of Shanghai on the war? What about the situation in other cities and towns in the rear? In a word, it is nothing more than darkness and depravity. How can the two attitudes of darkness and depravity be enough to cope with the modern peak of war? However, the Greater East Asia War has already laid a solid foundation for victory. After the victory, how will we take credit for it? If we do not take advantage of the day when the "decisive battle is imminent" to strictly rectify the rear, then once in the midst of chaos, China is regarded as one of the victorious countries, at that time we will definitely look at each other, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>In these seven years, there have indeed been some reforms to the ills before the war, but there are also many who have followed the old ways and even intensified them. Before the war, China was already an industrially backward country. After the war, it was suspended in various ways. While others were born with sufficient conditions, they also made use of the war process to carry out scientific and rationalized rectification, and worked hard with their heads buried, making greater progress in all aspects. For example, in 1942 alone, Germany registered as many as 53,000 patent licenses (see "German Newsletter" published by Bikenheng Book Company), which is already visible. After the end of this war, regardless of how China wins, it will eventually seek the way of co-existence and co-prosperity in East Asia as a member of East Asia. If we do not take advantage of the day when the "decisive battle is imminent" to first strive to eliminate the accumulated abuses of the heavy industry, preserve the vitality of the people, establish the minimum foundation for construction, and establish various plans for undertakings, then there will be no way to make up for the loss, and it will be too late to take measures in the future. How can we achieve the mission that our Chinese nation should bear? "Decisive battle imminent," "Decisive battle imminent"!</p>
<h3>The Central Political Council Yesterday Resolved to Change Suhuai to Huaihai Province and Approved the Wartime Price Control Ordinance</h3>
<h3>The Central Political Council Yesterday Resolved to Change Suhuai to Huaihai Province and Approved the Wartime Price Control Ordinance</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. The 131st meeting of the Central Political Committee was held on the 13th and approved the following important cases: The Chairman reported on the adjustment of the organization of the Special Committee stationed in Shanghai, and the concurrent member of the Legal System Special Committee, Tang Yinghuang, has been removed from his post.

Approved the National Revenue and Expenditure General Budget for the first half of the 33rd year compiled by the Ministry of Finance. Approved the proposal on studying the division of provinces and regions, and first established Huaihai Province in the Suhuai region. The counties under its jurisdiction will be handed over to the Ministry of Interior to be drafted with the region. Approved the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Control drafted by the Ministry of Industry. All previously promulgated Provisional Regulations on Stabilizing Prices, Provisional Regulations on Cracking Down on Private Price Hikes, and Temporary Measures for Stabilizing Prices shall be terminated. (The articles are recorded separately) Chen Zengyun was specially appointed as a member of the National Economic Council. Qian Sun was appointed as a member of the Supervisory Yuan.</p>
<h3>Chen Shi Speaks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. The National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Control. Chen Shi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, issued a statement: Price control is the central issue of the wartime economy. The government has always carefully studied and discussed this in order to obtain a reasonable solution. The fundamental countermeasures for price stabilization, such as increasing production, unblocking sources, improving allocation, and conserving consumption, have been formulated and actively promoted, and will be implemented in the near future. As for the management of prices themselves, it is necessary to closely match the times and strive for perfection. The various price control laws and regulations previously implemented were originally temporary measures. With the sudden changes in the environment, they had to be revised. The Provisional Regulations on Wartime Price Control promulgated this time are based on this purpose. The main points of the content are briefly listed below. The competent authorities in various localities, together with relevant agencies, should organize price review committees to be able to adapt to local conditions. Relevant parties and commercial groups should participate in order to enable price review to exert great effectiveness. The categories of materials and items that should be evaluated should be limited to daily necessities first, so as to avoid a large number of categories that cannot be taken care of, and to ensure strict implementation in order to meet the purpose of stabilizing people's livelihood. For other materials and fees, the local economic bureau may consider the situation and draft items. The industry associations shall negotiate appropriate prices and abide by them together. Regardless of the officially set prices or the negotiated prices, the industry associations shall be responsible for supervising the members, so as to promote the spirit of self-governance in the business community. In addition, legal profits have also been prescribed standards, so that the evaluation in various places will not have different phenomena. Furthermore, the purchase of materials at evaluated prices shall not exceed the limit, so as to avoid competing for opportunities and reducing the number of supplies. In short, the main purpose of these regulations is to take the economic cycle as the center, promote the self-governance of industry associations in various places, and use fairness as the principle, so that wartime prices are stabilized within an appropriate range. However, this most important and extremely complex price issue, which has a close relationship with the stability of people's livelihood, cannot be solved without the cooperation of the upper and lower levels. I hope that the economic bureaus in various places will maintain close contact to keep the price changes in various places in a balanced state and jointly assume the responsibility for price control. Industry associations should supervise members to strictly abide by government orders. The general public should recognize the environment and assist in promoting management and implementation measures. If there are those who hold back, hoard, and speculate for exorbitant profits, then the laws are in place and will never be tolerated.</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies Key Points of Military Production: Emphasis on Enhancing Air Combat Capabilities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency, 13th. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, also Minister of Military Supplies, addressed the first meeting of the chiefs of military supply supervision on the second day (13th), pointing out that the important mission of the Military Supply Supervision Department is to promote and guide military supply production centered on quadrupling the production of aircraft. He also listed three points for the service of the military supply production administrative organs as follows: The focus of military supply production must be placed on enhancing air combat capabilities, so that it permeates the production aspect. Guide production to fully develop the spirit of struggle. Recognize the actual situation of production and strive to comprehensively develop production capacity.</p>
<h3>Bangkok City Bombed: Thai Prime Minister Broadcasts, Pointing out the Brutal Nature of the British and Americans</h3>
<p>Bangkok, Central News Agency, 13th. American planes came to bomb Bangkok on the night of the 10th and dropped many incendiary bombs in the northwest of the city, but the damage was very light. On the night of the 12th, American planes attacked again and bombed temples and streets in the central part of the city. The American planes that attacked twice were immediately fled after being bombed fiercely by the Japanese and Thai armies and anti-aircraft artillery fire. Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram broadcast to the nation on the night of the 12th, pointing out the brutality of the British and Americans, with the general idea that: Most of the bombs dropped by the American planes this time were incendiary bombs, causing slight losses to the property of the citizens. The Thai people have now learned about the brutal nature of Britain and the United States. Because Britain and the United States can hardly win with legitimate combat methods, they blindly bomb our country. We can see the world situation. The British and American troops on the Italian front have made no progress, and the second European front has not been opened up. As for the Pacific front, Britain and the United States have made no progress worth noting, only moving on isolated islands at sea. However, these small islands are not important. Therefore, Britain and the United States shifted their gaze and paid attention to Thailand, raiding Bangkok, and ordering their propaganda agencies to make false propaganda to the world, saying, "American planes bomb Bangkok in the air every day and drop many bombs. The enemy troops hardly fought back. The American air raid on Bangkok is as easy as playing golf." However, they do not know that this brutal method is difficult to achieve the final victory. Now that they have destroyed our temples and peaceful facilities, they will one day suffer the retribution of cause and effect.</p>
<h3>Domestic Opposition to US Forced Labor Case</h3>
<p>Washington, Central News Agency, 13th. According to Washington news: President Roosevelt's announced National Service Law and forced labor bill have been submitted to both houses of Congress. The bill stipulates that except for a few special exceptions, all men between the ages of 18 and 60 and women between the ages of 18 and 49 must serve. As for whether they are willing to join any labor union, it will be decided by the people themselves. It is reported that American labor union leaders Green and Mowley discussed the case with President Roosevelt on Wednesday. Mowley declared that there will be great opposition to the bill.</p>
<h3>Burma Reforms Local Administration: Country Divided into Four Regions to Streamline Labor and Resources</h3>
<p>Burma, Central News Agency, 13th. The Burmese government announced on the 12th that in order to promote administrative efficiency in the spirit of the New Order construction plan, the Burmese government recently convened local officials' meetings in both Upper and Lower Burma. Many government officials attended and held consultations on various important issues. Afterwards, National Representative Ba Maw decided to divide the Burmese administrative region into three regions and appoint local regional officials respectively. In the future, county officials will not need to receive central orders directly, but will directly consult with regional officials on important cases that have a direct impact on completing the war and building a new order, so as to handle them quickly. In addition, after this local administrative reform, Burma will be divided into upper, middle, and lower administrative regions, together with the Shan State region, for a total of four administrative regions. The counties under the jurisdiction of each newly established region and the location of the regional government are recorded as follows: The Upper Burma region has jurisdiction over five counties, and the government office is located in Mandalay. The Central Burma region has jurisdiction over eight counties, and the government office is located in Bassein. The Lower Burma region has jurisdiction over three counties, and the government office is located in Rangoon.</p>
<p>Rangoon, Central News Agency, 13th. The Burmese government announced on the 12th that after deciding to reform the local administrative structure, Burmese National Representative Ba Maw made a statement to this effect, stating that the purpose of the government's decision to reform the local administrative structure is to highly scientize the operation of Burma's abundant labor and materials, actively mobilize human and material resources, and exert its high efficiency. In the past, under British rule, the imbalance in the operation of materials and labor in Burma had reached its extreme. Upper Burma had less material and more labor. In the past, although the British transferred the labor of Upper Burma to the submerged land in the ancient channel of the Irrawaddy River, it completely failed because it was based on exploiting Burma. Therefore, it adopted the policy of Indian labor immigration, which still leaves a hidden danger. We are now deciding on a policy based on science to avoid repeating the old mistakes. Within the scope of the same climate and customs in Upper Burma, we will enable communication between the haves and have-nots. Therefore, even in today's difficult transportation, it will be beneficial to people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>First Armament Conference Solemnly Opened in Nanjing Yesterday: Chief of General Staff Bao Delivers Instructions on Behalf of the Chairman</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. The first National Armament Conference, which is responsible for adjusting and unifying armaments, solemnly opened in Nanjing today. The chairman of the conference is Ye Peng, the vice-chairmen are Chen Changzu and Li Yidi, the secretary-general is Huang Xi, and the deputy secretary-general is Wang Dexuan. At 9:00 a.m. this morning, all the representatives, totaling over one hundred people, gathered at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and led by the chairman and vice-chairmen, went to Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay respects to the Father of the Nation. At 10:30 a.m., they returned to the venue. At 10:40 a.m., the opening ceremony was solemnly held in the sound of resounding music. The arrangement of the venue was very simple and solemn. The central military officers present included Chief of General Staff Bao Wenyue of the Military Affairs Commission, Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Jianting, Deputy Director of the Military Council Fu Shuangying, and Commander of the Capital Garrison Chen Sizhen, etc. After the ceremony, Chief of General Staff Bao first delivered instructions on behalf of the Chairman (recorded separately). Then, Major General Teraoka gave a congratulatory speech on behalf of Colonel Yoshino. Conference Chairman Ye Peng delivered the opening speech. Finally, all the representatives took a group photo. The opening ceremony of the conference was thus concluded.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. After the first National Armament Conference opened at 10:49 a.m. on the 13th, the first meeting was held at 3:00 p.m. After the meeting, the proposals were divided into three groups for review.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Instructions</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 13th. Chairman Wang (Bao Wenyue, Chief of General Staff) of the Military Affairs Commission gave instructions at the opening of the first National Armament Conference as follows: Today, the Armament Adjustment Committee of this meeting convened military organs, troops, schools, and personnel in charge of military equipment in the capital to hold the first National Armament Conference, which is of great significance. Due to his busy official duties, the Chairman did not have time to attend and participate in the event, so he specially sent Chief of General Staff Bao Wenyue to deliver instructions on his behalf. Weapons are the second life of soldiers, as stated in the soldier's creed, which all our soldiers should understand. The quality of weapons is related to the strength of the army and the prosperity of the country, which is of great importance. This is why the Armament Conference was convened, and I hope that you will study and deliberate in detail, and carefully plan so as to be of assistance.</p>
<p>The Ministry of the Army is the competent authority for national armament administration. It has spared no effort in planning on weekdays. Considering that there are now many types of weapons in various troops, with different calibers, there are many difficulties in combat and replenishment. Therefore, the Armament Adjustment Committee has been established to concentrate the strength of the Ministry of the Army and the repair shops to unify the types and calibers of guns and repair damaged weapons. The central government has already made its greatest efforts to actively adjust and replenish. The troops should especially endure the difficulties of the times, do their best to take care of all weapons, and properly preserve them, so as to shoulder the great mission of this era. If anyone dares to neglect the law or even sell military firearms, they must know that the national law is in place and will never be tolerated, so as to warn the public.</p>
<p>At the height of the Greater East Asia War, ensuring security is the only mission of our soldiers. However, to ensure security, we must strengthen our strength, and we must cherish our weapons. To cherish our weapons, we must cultivate military equipment talents. Therefore, we must pay special attention to how to pay attention to the methods of weapon preservation and research, and how to recruit and train manufacturing and repair talents, and prepare for them in advance.</p>
<p>Since the National Government returned to the capital, all military plans, the replenishment of weapons and ammunition, etc., have been given all kinds of assistance from friendly countries. In addition to gratitude, we should also remember that in this extraordinary period, material resources are difficult, and we should especially cherish them, so as not to fail the earnest expectations. May each of you strive for it.</p>

<h3>Indian People Strive for Independence: Emotions Boil; Famine Severe in Bengal and Other Provinces</h3>
<p>Burma, Central News Agency, 13th. After the Provisional Government of Free India moved to Burma, it is now advancing towards the path of defeating the British and achieving final victory. Britain and the United States are eager to launch a general counter-offensive, which is actually a fatal blow. "The time has come for the 380 million people of India to rise up and build an Indian India." The Indian people are well aware of the untrustworthy actions of Britain towards India after the Second World War. Because Chairman Jiangtela Bose arrived in Burma, their enthusiasm for independence became even more boiling, and the power to resist Britain also increased. Recently, the situation in India is extremely unstable. The British army and government have made the maintenance of public security the premise, but no matter how Britain deceives the Indian people or oppresses them in any way, the voices of liberating the people of East Asia and the realization of the Greater East Asia will surely shatter Britain's ambitions. Indian soldiers on the Indian-Burmese border are now being transferred from the front line to the second line and are being closely monitored by the British army. These Indian soldiers have long had a national consciousness, so they deserted from the war one after another. To date, the number of deserters has reached hundreds of thousands. In addition, there is a great panic over food throughout India. Judging from Assam and Bengal, the two provinces that are most anti-British, the situation of Indian people starving to death is endless, and the tragic situation is unspeakable. In Calcutta alone, by the end of last year, there were as many as 10,000 orphans who survived after their parents starved to death. Although the British-Indian government has provided some relief to the people who are on the verge of starvation, the remote areas are beyond reach. The 3,900 villages and 6,000 feeding stations in Bengal Province are hell on earth. Moreover, the British and American joint forces stationed in Bengal and Assam have repeatedly committed atrocities against the Indian people, so the Indian people are full of resentment and are extremely angry. At a time when food shortages are imminent, the Indian government has issued a prohibition order to prevent Indian people from migrating to other places to seek food, while at the same time implementing a food distribution system and forcibly purchasing food from farmers, which has aroused great resentment among the Indian people. As a result, a riot occurred in British Leicestershire, and a total of six British people were killed or injured. In recent times, this kind of riot has gradually spread to the whole of India. Recently, the frequent attacks on military rice warehouses in eastern India are particularly noteworthy. Even more noteworthy is that food transport trains in Assam and Bengal have also been attacked. The frequent occurrence of such events is now beyond enumeration. The British army is taking extremely strict measures and hanging signs with the words "Relief for Refugees" on trains and trucks to avoid attacks. The situation in India is deteriorating in this way. Jiangtela Bose's visit to Burma this time should convey the hope of independence and the situation of practicing independence movements abroad to his compatriots.</p>
<h3>Japan Discovers Rare Metal Mine: Important Raw Material for Steelmaking</h3>
<p>Fukushima, Central News Agency, 13th. In order to develop resources buried underground, Japanese authorities have dispatched survey teams to survey various mountains across the country since last autumn. Recently, as a result of the active efforts of the Sendai Mining Supervisory Bureau, a large "Hortum" ore vein has been discovered near Ishikawa Town, Ishikawa County, Fukushima Prefecture. According to reports, "Hortum," like platinum and rhenium, is a rare element and an indispensable raw material for manufacturing special steel aircraft and vacuum tubes for radio communication equipment. Recently, due to the active increase in the production of aircraft, its demand has increased even more. However, in the past, it was only produced in parts of Korea and Malaysia, and there was no production in mainland Japan. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all sectors of Japan have been hoping that it could be produced domestically. Today, this has been realized, and the quality is very excellent. According to the survey, there are vast reserves of about tens of millions of tons near the Shinmei smoke mine that was discovered.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Raid Kueilin Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific, nine enemy Consolidated B-24 heavy bombers attacked Kueilin Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 12th, carrying out fierce bombing from extremely low altitudes and strafing the island with machine guns. The Japanese garrison immediately retaliated with heavy anti-aircraft fire, repelling them. Japanese losses were slight.</p>
<h3>Kirovograd Region Becomes Center of Major Eastern Front Battle: Fierce Battle for Sarny</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: The focus of the Eastern Front fighting is currently still in the Kirovograd region. Soviet troops are currently advancing towards Sarny, a vital railway hub in western Ukraine, and fierce battles are underway. Heavy fighting is also taking place at the Crimean bridgehead and north of Kerch.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: In the past 24 hours, the fighting has intensified in the two areas north of Kremenets Vitebsk, where the main thrust of the Eastern Front offensive is located. Northeast of Kovel, the enemy launched a fierce offensive with several infantry divisions, supported by a large number of aircraft and artillery, but failed. In the Dnieper River bend, Soviet pressure from Dnipropetrovsk has not diminished, but has also not achieved any results. Soviet troops are continuously arriving in Kirovograd, and German forces are also counterattacking incessantly. Southwest of Cherkassy, fierce fighting is turbulent and unstable, especially in the southeast and southwest of Pohrebyshche, where the battle lines are increasingly uneven. A Soviet infantry division, a tank brigade, and an artillery detachment were cut off and annihilated there. Only local skirmishes occurred west of Berdychiv and west of Novohrad-Volynskyi. West of Rechitsa, the enemy penetrated the German front line in several places, and the enemy launched fierce attacks in the Vitebsk region all day without success.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: The German military received the latest news from the front line last night: In the past 48 hours, the Soviet offensive launched from the bridgehead northeast of Kovel has made no progress. According to German estimates, the Soviets have concentrated a large force of four or five divisions in preparation for an attack, but the Soviets have not only failed to expand their strongholds, but some areas have also been surrounded.</p>
<h3>Fierce Offensive and Defensive Battles in Southern Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) The German Führer's Headquarters announced on the 12th: Fierce defensive battles continued west of Venafro on the Southern Italian front. German troops engaged in fierce fighting with enemy forces at Cerbara and the heights northeast of the city before withdrawing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) Huitong News Agency: U.S. forces resumed their offensive on Monday, attacking the German mountain positions guarding the Cassino Plain and the Liri Valley. The focus of the fighting is in the areas of Cervaro and Viticuso, but Cassino. The road south of Mignano was also affected. As a result of the enemy's fierce attack on Monday, they only penetrated the German front line at one point near Cervaro. The next day, the U.S. military greatly reinforced its offensive, attempting to expand it, and finally occupied a ridge northeast of Cervaro. The German echeloned defensive line is extremely advantageous for defense. It is recalled that after the U.S. military occupied Venafro on November 6, it advanced towards the upper reaches of the Volturno River, and its battle line was no more than 25 kilometers long. However, after more than ten weeks of attacking, it still could not break through to Cassino, which shows the foolishness of Anglo-American strategy.</p>
<h3>Fortifications Constructed on the French Coast: 10 Million Tons of Concrete Used</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) According to Huitong News Agency: Various fortifications have been built on the west coast of France, from the English Channel to the Bay of Biscay, using 10 million tons of reinforced concrete. If the trucks transporting this concrete were lined up in a single file, they could circle the equator one and a half times.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Bravely Intercepts and Achieves Great Results: American Aircraft Losses in Attack on Germany Amount to One-Half</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) German forces shot down 136 American bombers in northwestern Germany on the 11th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from London, the U.S. Eighth Air Force Command announced on the 12th: On the 11th, more than 700 American Flying Fortresses and heavy bombers, escorted by Thunderbolts and Lightning fighters, attacked northwestern Germany. However, German defenses were extremely strong, and a fierce air battle ensued. In this battle, 59 American four-engine bombers and five fighters failed to return to base.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) U.S. long-range bomber squadrons, under the escort of fighter aircraft on the morning of the 11th, bombed the industrial areas of Halle, Magdeburg, Dessau, and other places in central Germany. The German army bravely intercepted with large squadrons of fighter aircraft, resulting in unprecedented great results. It is reported that when the U.S. Air Force bombed Schweinfurt last October, it suffered a fierce barrage of German Air Force rocket artillery and suffered a disastrous defeat, losing 120 heavy bombers. However, they still did not recognize the power of German air defenses. After the new bomber squadron commander, Doolittle, took office, he forcibly carried out this attack with a large formation of over 300 Flying Fortresses and Consolidated four-engine heavy bombers, under the cover of over 100 long-range fighters in cloudy weather, attempting to penetrate deep into German territory to carry out fierce bombing. However, the power of the weapons is increasing.</p>
<h3>Bombing of Sofia</h3>
<p>Sofia, 12th A government statement said: Many buildings and residential homes and schools in the central part of Sofia were destroyed, and the embassy district was also hit, resulting in many casualties.</p>
<h3>General Orbay Succeeds as Turkish Chief of Staff</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Central News Agency) German News Agency: Turkish Chief of Staff General Jamak has retired with a pension. The Turkish government has appointed General Orbay to fill his vacancy.</p>
<h3>Wartime German Home Front Life: Women Join the Production Ranks</h3>
<p>Nobuhiko Ushiba, Second Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, served at the embassy in Berlin for a total of six and a half years, starting from the rise of the National Socialist Party regime in 1933. He departed from Berlin on November 13, and returned to Japan via Turkey and the Soviet Union with Ambassador to Hungary Okubo, arriving in Harbin on the 26th. He spoke about the unwavering determination of the German people recently, refuting the propaganda inciting against Allied Germany and dispelling anxieties about the European situation.</p>
<h3>No Anxiety About Food Supply</h3>
<p>There is no anxiety about the lives of the German people. Price controls are a model for the world. Compared to the amount of currency, material resources are not sufficient, but inflation has been completely suppressed, astonishing the world. Speaking of food, Europe has had a bumper year this year, so there is no anxiety. The view that there would be shortages due to abandoning Ukraine is wrong. The agricultural products produced in Ukraine only meet the needs of the local troops. Moreover, the German military mainly wants the agricultural products west of the Dnieper River, so even if the German military completely loses Ukraine, there will be no impact. From the perspective of Germany's overall food supply, Ukraine is truly insignificant.</p>
<p>Some people are concerned about the American bombing of the Ploiești oil fields (Romania). Ploiești was only bombed once by American aircraft in the spring of this year, and there have been no continued bombings since then, indicating that bombing Romania is technically very difficult. Moreover, Ploiești's oil production capacity is now one and a half to two times greater, so worrying about the Romanian oil fields is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>Price controls are proceeding miraculously well and are extremely satisfactory. The rationing of daily necessities is also very smooth. From these perspectives, we do not believe that internal collapse will be triggered in Germany. The allocation of beef has decreased slightly, but recently the allocation of bread has increased to ten kilograms every four weeks, and the allocation of potatoes has also increased by three to three and a half kilograms per week. These figures are the minimum allocation amount for ordinary citizens. Manual laborers receive one and a half to three times that amount.</p>
<p>Laborers are further divided into three categories: the most strenuous laborers, strenuous laborers, and long-hour laborers, each with special allocations.</p>
<h3>Implementing Appropriate Policies</h3>
<p>The National Socialist Party is extremely stable. National Socialism and the people are completely integrated. The idea of distinguishing National Socialism from the people is an outdated concept. Today, Germany is able to carry out such a large-scale war because the foundation and organization of National Socialism have been established and are being properly utilized, much like the development of neighborhood associations in Japan. After air raids, the party's special forces, NSV (National Welfare Organization), take on all the work, from cooking to providing clothing. This organization is spread throughout the country.</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy in Germany is youth education and social policy. These two play a major role in supporting the home front. The effects of the Nazi-unique Hitler Jugend education are now also clearly visible. The emphasis on discipline, compulsory obedience, and sacrificing personal interests for the public good in this education is extremely valuable. The military training in the Jugend is also of great importance in today's war. In terms of labor service organizations, all citizens, regardless of wealth, ignite a sense of national identity. The basis of social policy is the existing social insurance system for unemployment, disasters, etc. Since the outbreak of the war, social policy has been even more astonishing, focusing on constant efforts for labor.

<p>Information Department Chief Hirota Comments on Roosevelt's Message: American Manpower Shortages Are Now Evident</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Mr. Hirota, Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, specifically criticized President Roosevelt's message to Congress on the 11th of this month at a regular press conference at 3:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Exaggerated Propaganda and Self-Contradiction</p>
<p>Chief Hirota first pointed out the main points of the message's content: America's second production increase plan, ensuring domestic stability. He then said that we all consider the circumstances of President Roosevelt's propaganda for production increases to Congress and the outside world to be a spectacle. Upon investigation, President Roosevelt has always promoted that America's production power is absolutely unlimited, especially for munitions, like an astronomical quantity. Moreover, after the Tehran Conference, the US, British and Soviet plans to overturn the Axis were promoted as complete and about to be implemented. From President Roosevelt's past exaggerated statements and the message to Congress this time, it's not difficult to see the actual situation within America. That is why we are so surprised by America's urgent need to increase production now. The so-called unlimited American production power of the past is like a soldier going to the front without weapons, panicking inexplicably, which is self-contradictory. According to the large-scale propaganda launched by the anti-Axis powers, the reason is that their preparations are insufficient. In particular, in the message President Roosevelt presented, he mentioned the national service law. Originally, to maintain an army stationed overseas, the service of ten laborers would be required. Even if this is realized, it would require tens of millions of manpower. Therefore, America's domestic manpower is even more insufficient, and in the production increase cause, it will encounter extremely great difficulties. From this point of view, it can be asserted that America's manpower is insufficient.</p>
<p>American Offensive Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Regarding the South Pacific situation, the American offensive is gradually declining, and the plan to concentrate on the second front in Europe has not formally begun. The biggest reason is that America's domestic production power has declined. Therefore, President Roosevelt advocated ensuring domestic stability and warning the general public and domestic factions to unite closely as the third year of the war begins. From this, it can also be proved that internal divisions in America are quite severe. The American public has expressed antipathy towards the meaningless world war Roosevelt launched, and this situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Regarding the two proposals to strengthen production and conscript manpower, it is believed that the American people will have even stronger opposition. To prevent popular opposition, President Roosevelt made the aforementioned request for close unity. Originally, the government's policies should be well-received by the people, without the need to request it from the people. Therefore, there is considerable doubt about whether the people will accept President Roosevelt's policies. In addition, the reason for President Roosevelt's message is primarily due to the strong solidarity of Japan, Germany, and the other Axis powers, and their large production power, which worries Roosevelt, so he has no choice but to ask the people to unite to strengthen production and save the crisis. Second, President Roosevelt and the other anti-Axis leaders are employing all kinds of cunning schemes to defeat Japan and Germany. These schemes are nothing more than empty talk and will be impossible to implement in practice. We can review past situations as examples, so the strength of this so-called production increase and unity is obviously weak, and its effect is practically waste paper.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Sixth Scholarship Fund Hopes to Continue Donations: Mr. Li Shiwu Donates 100,000 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the sixth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, all sectors have enthusiastically responded and generously donated, which is deeply inspiring. However, upon review, the number of students applying for assistance this year has reached more than 16,000, setting a new record for the number of applicants in previous years. The total amount of the scholarship fund for this year was originally set at 3 million yuan. Calculating an average subsidy of 500 yuan per person, it can only assist 6,008 students. More than half of the students will inevitably be unable to receive assistance. Moreover, the current scholarship fund is only over 2 million yuan, making it equally difficult to allocate. It is hoped that people from all walks of life, in view of the large number of students awaiting assistance and the insufficient donations, will generously open their purses and, in addition to their own donations, also encourage relatives and friends to participate in this benevolent act. It would be most fortunate.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shiwu Donates 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Following Mr. Sheng Wenyi's generous donation the day before yesterday, Mr. Li Shiwu, through fundraising, generously donated 100,000 yuan yesterday. Mr. Li is a philanthropist who is enthusiastic about social welfare. His warm sympathy for this newspaper's scholarship fund and his donation of a large sum of money are greatly admired. "Helping students is the greatest kindness, and doing good is the greatest joy." There are many kind-hearted people in society, which further strengthens the belief of the colleagues at this newspaper.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Sympathy for Student Aid from All Sectors</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sizheng Hall donated 50,000 yuan for scholarships, the Master of Quzhai donated 20,000 yuan, Yie Ji donated 20,000 yuan, and Song Ji donated 10,000 yuan, benefiting students and deeply admired. Mr. Zhu Ermei, a well-known Western doctor in this city, expressed deep sympathy for poor students and helped raise 20,000 yuan from Liang Yi Ji, 1,000 yuan from Mr. Tan Anhuai, and Dr. Zhu subsidized 1,000 yuan, demonstrating a deep sense of public service and greatly admired. Mr. Xia Guoliang, the Fire Chief of the Eighth District Office, has always expressed compassion for the suffering of impoverished children. He conveyed this sentiment to his colleagues, encouraging them to do their best to provide assistance. As a result, they collectively raised 1,800 yuan of national currency from their monthly salaries, which is truly sincere. Mr. Lu Jinshan wrote a letter stating that he was touched by this newspaper's repeated appeals for the impoverished. Therefore, he decided not to host a New Year's Eve dinner with relatives and friends at the end of the lunar year, given the current difficult times. He specially saved 3,000 yuan from the New Year's Eve dinner expenses and transferred it to the scholarship fund, hoping that enlightened individuals would continue to donate. Mr. Zhao Yin'nian expressed deep approval for this newspaper's scholarship program and specially donated 2,000 yuan of national currency to provide assistance. We would like to express our gratitude to the impoverished students on his behalf.</p>
<p>Students Who Can Afford to Study Should Not Apply</p>
<p>In recent days, this newspaper has received letters or telephone reports from readers, all stating that some students who have the ability to afford tuition also see it as an unexpected gain and participate in the application. Not only is their motivation opportunistic and detrimental to their character, but they also occupy the places of truly impoverished students, which is unbearable. It is deeply regrettable. The establishment of this newspaper's scholarship fund was originally intended to assist outstanding children from impoverished families who truly have no ability to study. Therefore, those who have the ability should not only not deprive those who have no ability of the opportunity to study, but should also provide assistance to the best of their ability. If one insists on taking advantage of the situation for personal gain, it will not be difficult to uncover the truth. Once an investigation is conducted or a report is made by a reader, in addition to holding the guarantor accountable, their name will be publicly announced in the newspaper as a warning to those who take advantage of the situation. Therefore, it is hoped that all students applying for assistance and their parents should carefully ask themselves before submitting the application form whether there is a need to apply. If they can support themselves with effort, they should not apply again.

<p>Comments from the Economic Sector</p>
<h3>Looking at it from Three Perspectives</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange was ordered to resume operations, Chinese stocks have been mainly traded on a next-day delivery basis. Although there was once a plan to change to a one-week delivery system, it was ultimately believed by public opinion to be sufficient to promote speculation and manipulation, and the relevant authorities also considered it necessary to seriously consider it, so the principle of spot buying and forward selling has been maintained until now. Recently, due to the demands of various brokers, there has been a revival of the proposal to implement spot loans for convenient delivery, and there is even talk of implementing it when the market opens on January 1st. Therefore, we would like to continue from our discussion of the convenient delivery issue on November 23rd of last year and look at the future of securities trading from three different angles.</p>
<p>What are these three angles? They are the securities exchange, the brokers, and the public buying and selling stocks. After the implementation of the one-week delivery system, the benefit to the securities exchange is that the expansion of the trading volume allows it to collect more commissions from brokers; the benefit to the brokers is that they can handle the complex delivery matters with ease, and at the same time, they can charge customers more commissions; the benefit to the public buying and selling stocks is that they can buy a large amount of stocks by paying a small amount of margin. Although the benefits obtained from the above three angles are somewhat different from each other, they are the same in that they are benefits. However, can the stock market in the future achieve "calm seas"? I am afraid that no one can be certain! Assuming that it is not possible, the securities exchange can still impose a "sanction" according to Chapter 12 of its "Operating Rules," and brokers can still "love them and want them to live, hate them and want them to die," but the male and female public who buy and sell stocks blindly have no ability to control any environment. If they simply use gambling methods to trade stocks, the result will inevitably be one of two: either make a fortune or throw themselves into the Huangpu River? Therefore, in the future, those who do not treat stocks as an investment but as an object of speculation should be cautious!</p>
<h3>The Year-End Closing Period is Approaching: Silver Firms Adjust Finances, Legitimate Needs Can Apply for Interbank Loans</h3>
<p>In view of the upcoming year-end closing period for various industries, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee, in order to adjust the finances of the same industry and stabilize the market, stipulates that member banks and firms can apply for interbank loans by providing property as collateral, in accordance with the interbank lending regulations, if they have legitimate business needs for funds. Each bank applies directly to the Bank Union Committee, and each silver firm entrusts the Silver Firm Preparation Committee to handle the matter, but it must be in accordance with the discount limit stipulated by the committee from November of last year to January of this year, and absolutely cannot exceed this limit.</p>
<h3>Adjustment by the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>Exchange Remittance Fee Rate to Increase by Double Starting in January: The Central Reserve Bank, as regional branches and offices are being established everywhere, and its capital is becoming more flexible, its exchange remittance business is becoming more developed. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the bank, in view of the recent increase in telegraph fees by the telegraph bureau, is adjusting the exchange remittance fee rate. In addition to the postal remittance and draft remittance rates, which will remain the same as before, all exchange remittance telegraphic transfers will be increased by double the original rate, and all exchange remittance handling fees will be increased by double, starting this month.</p>
<h3>Divergent Trends in Chinese Stock Prices: Real Estate Active, Department Stores Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks fell sharply in the morning and did not recover, mainly due to the tightening of credit and the excessive rise in the past three days, which made new buyers hesitate. The situation stabilized in the afternoon, and within thirty minutes before the close of trading, real estate stocks suddenly showed their strength. It was rumored that Yongxing had an increase in capital with half of the shares being issued and sent, and other industry stocks followed suit and turned colorful. Finally, real estate and inferior industrial stocks fell across the board. The closing prices for the evening are recorded below.</p>

<h3>Social Service: A Truly Deserving Vocational Supplementary School</h3>
<p>No miscellaneous fees or deposits are charged</p>
<p>The Xiuneng Voluntary Vocational Supplementary School, located in the Minli Middle School at No. 414 Weihaiwei Road, is organized by several enthusiastic young educators. The expenses are donated by several school directors. Due to limited finances, they can only rent one classroom for classes in rotation. The curriculum includes Chinese, Japanese, English, bookkeeping, and shorthand, and there are a total of more than 360 students. Bookkeeping is the most popular, which shows the urgent needs of society. They punish vocational youths for their inconsistency, and specially stipulate that three months is one semester. In order to achieve the policy of attaching equal importance to character and learning, they often invite famous figures in academic circles to give lectures on character and professional cultivation. The next semester plans to hire two university professors to serve as the highest tutors in the Chinese and English subjects, and to hire foreign personnel to teach the Japanese subject, in order to improve and enhance the efficiency of the teaching affairs. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in the community can give sympathy and visit their facilities. In addition to not charging tuition fees, the school does not charge any miscellaneous fees or deposits, truly fulfilling the two words "voluntary." ()</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Ambition (4)</p>
<p>Compared with Komori, Jinren's character of not admitting defeat belongs to the feminine. He always puts in effort secretly. Even if he was asked to run back and forth to Myoenji Temple twice, he would not talk about it to the teacher. But he also admired Komori's heroic demeanor and straightforward personality. Their group leader Komori, at the same time, Gu Yuhe, who has the same surname as Jinren, Wan Dai, who comes from a military family and is also aspiring to the army, and Takao, a childhood friend, have formed a comrade.</p>
<p>Jinren is welcomed everywhere, but even so, at first there were misunderstandings about his upright attitude and taciturn temperament, thinking that he was "putting on airs." But people who have actually interacted with him know that he has a very cheerful and straightforward personality, and at the same time has a special attractive force. The friendship of this group of little friends continues very closely.</p>
<p>When they started the second grade semester, Ambassador Matsuoka, with a tragic face, returned from Geneva. They had always thought that the policy of their home country, the Japanese government, would cooperate with foreign countries in everything. This time, they heard that they had withdrawn from the League of Nations, and the boys felt a subtle impulse in their chests. Their attitude towards Muguom was like an impression of a silent husband suddenly jumping up from his seat.</p>
<p>"War" is about to break out, right? "The clear-headed Yuhe, inspecting the international situation at that time, said this.</p>
<p>But after a long period of time, the war did not break out, and the short spring of Samo had passed, and it was summer vacation again. In the summer of the year, Jinren's mother had already allowed Jinren to swim, so Jinren felt very happy. Imitating the side stroke, he swam all the way to the "Hayato" of the Kagoshima Merchant Marine School. They ran back and forth naked on the deck, and some people were scolded by the crew for climbing on the rope.</p>
<p>"Good, very good!" Jinren also expressed his agreement, and he never knew that the ship would have such a great charm. Hayato is a medium-sized sailing ship with an auxiliary steam cylinder, which is far from comparable to the large ships of the so-called "sea city." But this is also enough to satisfy the dreams of young people. Jinren felt a kind of envy for Takao, who was planning to become a naval officer in the future—</p>
<p>"Hey, why don't you take the naval academy exam too?" Takao said this while using an unproficient side stroke.</p>
<p>"Don't mention me..." Jinren's voice, because he drank a mouthful of water, was not heard clearly in half.</p>
