<h3>重視現實</h3>
<p>何謂現實，就是[眼前的實際事態]。現實的演變，必然有其客觀的因素。如不重視現實，如不重視事態演變的客觀因素，而處理事態，每易流爲幻想。幻想與理想又有不同，理想有其客觀的理論，然而不顧現實的理想，不接近現實的理想，尚且不易實現，何況旣不顧現實，又無理論根據的幻想，焉能實現呢？　　政府的政策，尤其是政令的決定，如果不能顧到現實，不重視人民要求，不重視民間疾苦，那末，成了紙上談兵，也就等於幻想。甚至相反的爲害人民。所以，政府決定政策政令，如不經過民意機關的審議研究，不易獲得人民的普遍瞭解與擁護，形成政府自政府，人民自人民的現象。試舉例言之。　　在政治方面言，提高行政效率，樹立廉潔政治，自爲政府隨時隨地的責任，可是，如不顧到公務人員的待遇，則一切提高行政效率，樹立廉絜政治的計劃都是空談，其次，確立治安，更爲戰時最必要的事，然而，如不顧到軍警的待遇，不能使安心爲職務效命。則期望治安確立不易獲得實效。地方治安不能確立，行政效率不能提高，地方政治就不能上軌道，中樞政治也就沒有力量，而中樞政治沒有力量，地方政治當然無法推動。所以，現在公務人員以及軍警的待遇不能維持生活，就是現實，如果不重視現實，雖有種種處理方法，結果不免流於幻想。　　在經濟方面言，增加生產，已爲毫無問題的一致要求。但是現實問題足以妨礙增產，甚且促使減產的，如不先行解決，惟是提出動聽的口號，終於事實無裨的。什麼是現實問題呢？如動辦不足，原料不足，運輸不便，荷雜太多等等。其次，安定民生，更是天經地義了，可是，民生中最大問題的物價一項，始終高漲，尤其物價中最主要的米價，最近又在狂跳。戶口米配給不能足量，已爲黑市高漲因素的一端，而最近米統會復禁止八公斤以上米的移運，更爲刺激米價的因素，所以，自禁止移運辦法公布以後，三五日內米價黑市復漲十分之三。只能公布刺激米價上升的辦法，而不能公布抑低米價下降的辦法。例如此種不顧現實的辦法，過去，我們一再指出，應鄭重決定。凡是不能重視現實，而只憑主觀武斷的處理，結果終成幻想而已。成爲幻想以後，在當局固然無知無覺，而一般人民則又叫苦連天了，可不愼哉。　　我們一再倡言，促成上海市爲政治模範區，如果不重視現實，而謀治安確立與民生改善入手，則也將流爲幻想。我們說重視現實，當然不是過分遷就現實，　如說現實是一種不法行爲，當然不能因爲是現實而承認不法行爲。不過我們必須知道不法行爲所以形成的背後現實，然後加以糾正才能切實有效。</p>

<p>中國前綫日軍某基地二十九日中央社電日轟炸機隊，二十六日夜利用月光，長驅急襲川省成都機塲，羣向滑走路周圍地區投彈，炸燬停放地上之駐渝美空軍B29型機七架，並使機塲設施三處發生爆炸。於此駐渝美空軍B29型機之根據地，已被澈底粉碎，是夜日機隊更空襲成都，渝戰門機一架於獲悉日機來襲後，即騰空邀擊，然仍未能阻碍日機隊襲擊成都。惟當日機隊抵達成都時，天氣即漸次惡劣，俄頃成都上空，遂驟然下雨，致視界非常漠糊。日指揮機一架當即冒驟雨急襲渝機塲，當時渝機塲上空驟雨忽止，明月照射，機塲縱貫南北之滑走路，及其四週之大誘導路因此遂大放光明。惟渝高射砲火，亦無任何活動，此種情形，實堪稱奇蹟也。日機向滑走路之東北方投彈後，第二批日機，即分別向機塲之西南方及西方投下巨彈，使東方之誘導路設施兩處，及西方誘導路設施兩處，燃起紅黑之火燄，料係飛機被炸焚燬而引起者，其時第四及第五批日機，直視機塲之火燄，繼向滑走路之東方挺進，移時在高度五百米之翼下，發現引擎四發之大型機及B29型機，縱列於東方誘導路之掩體內，日機向其投彈後，遂急速上昇，當時渝機塲設施兩處已發生火燄，另有三處設施因爆炸火烟上騰，其他日機亦相繼急降施以轟炸，日轟炸機隊於轟炸成都成功後，遂全部悠然飛返原防。</p>
<h3>梧州擊落敵機十架</h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　渝美空軍感受日軍之威脅，爲實施反攻，挽回頹勢，特於二十八日使用B24型機二十架，P51型機三十架以上之戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊，大舉來襲華南方面之日軍前綫，轟炸三水（廣州西方四十公里）附近，日戰鬥機隊當即迎擊，戰至下午二時餘，遂於梧州附近擊落其P51型五架，B24型一機，收獲合計擊落擊破敵機十架之戰果，其餘敵機潰走。此役日機亦有一架壯烈自炸。</p>
<h3>日機進攻柳州機塲</h3>
<p>日軍前綫二十九日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，二十八日夜空襲柳州機塲，冒地上猛烈之高射砲火，猛烈攻擊，擊燬敵大型機二架，小型機三架，並擊毀小型機一架，將其滑行路澈底破壞，然後全隊安返基地。　　日軍前綫某基地二十九日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，二十七夜急襲柳州機塲，猛炸停放塲內渝美機。收獲之戰果如下：被炸者小型機九架，擊毀大型機一架，小型機四架，合計十四架，日機全部安返。　　日軍前綫某基地二十九日中央社電　日軍俯衝轟炸機隊，連日出動，急襲江西省之渝美空軍第一綫基地羣，與柳州方面之連絡要衝廣西東北部地區，東部中國沿岸地帶之渝軍退路將被遮斷。二十六日日軍機俯衝轟炸隊之一部，冒陰雨急襲梧州北方約百里之賀縣，炸碎倉庫一座。二十八日晨，攻擊架縣西方二十公里之八步貨物集積所，中彈起火，該地區爲遂川贛州基地羣之惟一後方連絡路及補給路，由於日軍之猛烈轟炸，敵之退路，事實上業遭威脅。</p>
<h3>西綫戰事呈膠着狀態德國境防衛戰發揮威力</h3>
<p>里斯本二十八日中央社電　德軍於西綫北部之激戰中，終於獲得決定之勝利，英第一空輸師團於二十六日全被殲滅，於是反軸心軍由荷蘭方面突破齊格斐防綫，繼續進入魯爾工業地帶之企圖，即全被粉碎。德軍於德國西部國境防衛戰中，繼續發揮最大威力。　　里斯本二十九日中央社電　西綫戰局現稍呈膠着狀態。盧森堡國境地區·法東部南錫·魯納維爾方面，依然繼續激戰。現雙方約二百五十萬餘之大軍，集於北自荷蘭南至北法及瑞士國境，全綫戰局將大有變化。　　柏林二十九日中央社電　德國社訊：星期三荷蘭南部與布根台大門間之戰事，其規模較小於前數日，美軍指揮部方極力增派生力軍至前綫，並增強其已延長之供應綫。美軍攻勢之焦點，大致爲亞琛反梅茲，該兩地已集中有敵軍之強大機械化及坦克車部隊，美軍指揮部顯已放棄其自北面打開布根台大門之企圖。</p>
<h3>義北反軸心軍採鉗形攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：義前綫反軸心軍攻勢之焦點，在雷米尼·聖阿康傑洛·及費倫蘇拉區域。英第八軍右翼企圖由阿平寗山與瑪薩諾湖區域間之窄狹地帶向西北推進，英第八軍左翼與美第五軍右翼聯合向東北推進，企圖會師於伊莫拉·法恩薩區。反軸心軍在有利情勢下，採取鉗形攻勢，或可包圍凱賽林上將之部隊之左翼。德軍爲避免包圍，必須自山區與礁湖區之地峽，退至波洛那·阿根泰之綫，然反軸心軍雖有龐大之兵力與充足之戰具，僅能使德軍逐步後退。反軸心軍在福泰山隘及比尼山等處，僅有局部勝利而已。</p>
<h3>東綫戰事焦點移洪羅邊境北路德軍繼續避離行動</h3>
<p>柏林二十九日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫德軍之抵抗已加強，蘇軍當局所計劃攻擊里加及沿岸區域，及包圍德方在北綫之軍隊尚未實現。大批蘇軍集中於該處，并有坦克車一千輛，波羅的海區德軍之解脫運動，在殿後部隊掩護下賡續進行，蘇軍則緊追中。蘇軍對東普魯士亦加緊攻擊，但無成功可言。中路局勢稍見鬆弛，波叛軍領袖波爾所稱已控制華沙全部郊外，與事實不符，因在南郊諾加托夫之軍隊已投降，蘇軍損矢步兵二十師及坦克車四團後，尚未增調後備軍前來補充。預料蘇軍將由內地或其他戰塲調來，以侵入斯洛伐克，俾對洪牙利得進行鉗形行動，蘇軍現再移其戰事焦點至洪羅邊境。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾在下院報告戰局</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十九日中央社電　德國社訊，據倫敦消息：邱吉爾首相昨在下院發表檢討目前戰局之演說稱，諾曼第一役爲全部戰爭中最偉大之一役，英美軍目下在法國者，其數在一百萬至三百萬之間，經一百二十天之戰事後，法境英美軍之比數，爲英軍四師圍對美軍五師團半，英軍陣亡受傷與失蹤者九萬人以上，同時美軍之損失在十四萬五千人以上。</p>
<h3>歐洲戰事勢將延長</h3>
<p>首相繼稱，吾人不應期望戰爭之立即停止，依渠之見，戰爭之結束尚有數月。關於對外之政治問題，邱吉爾力言英美蘇同盟，較前更爲密切，萬一波蘭連界發生領土上變動，則英國當予蘇以協助。蘇聯要求安全之邊界，及其西部邊界旁應有[友善之國家]，此舉自屬合理，關於此一問題，米柯拉席克及其波蘭流亡委員會之同僚，不久將在莫斯科重開談判。</p>
<h3>三頭會議年底舉行</h3>
<p>關於鄧巴頓奧克斯會議，尚未作成滿意之協定，渠力言[三巨頭會議]之必要，但此項會議須於美國總統選舉後始能舉行，會議之時間或在十二月間，地點尚未決定。　　邱吉爾於演講完畢後宣稱，渠會與羅斯福總統討論不少關於戰爭進行之問題，以及應取何種步驟，能使斯達林一俟軍事局勢許可時，加入三角會議</p>
<h3>決戰下的文化界與教育界</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>是文化人的一份子，到故都來少不得也和這裹的文化人接觸一下。有幾位是我兩年來在有關新聞和宣傳的會議中所熟識的，可是大半卻是從未會過一面。前幾天當我去武德報社拜防柳龍光先生的時候，他就希望我能在他們召開決戰文學者大會時去看看。果然在九月二十三日他們就發請帖來邀我去，自然到了翌晨我就免不得去參觀一下。</p>
<h3>決戰文學者大會</h3>
<p>所謂決戰文學者大會，原來就是由華北作家協會所主持，其目的即在昂揚決戰文學意識，推進國民文學運動，以期完成決戰下文化人的使命。那天到會的，除華北作家協會全體會員二百餘人之外，有當地中日雙方的報道當局，以及文化界代表。大會是在上午十時許開始，由新近辭職的北大校長錢稻孫主席，在通過完成決戰勝利的決議文後，即由作家協會頒發華北文藝獎金。此次得獎者，計有馬鹽的[太平怨]，楊鮑的[生之廻歸淺]，雷研的[良田]，蕭艾的[萍歸集]，穆伊芒的[夜鶯吟]，王羅的[長命百歲]。正獎僅馬驪一名，得獎金一千元，餘則爲獎金二百元。　　那一天在會塲上致辭的，有情報局管翼賢，新民會宣傳局長陳宰平，繼且有來賓代表的演說。所謂來賓代表除電影公司理事長孫潤宇外，柳龍光先生臨時請記者發言一次。然後始由竹田報道部長作時局講演，闡明決戰大勢的歸趨很詳。午餐後，由藤澤研究所所長藤澤親雄博士演講，其演講的大意乃在闡明以我國的道學來救濟今日西洋的功利觀念。在藤澤演講之後，始續開作家協會第三次會員大會。</p>
<h3>作家協會變更組織</h3>
<p>這一次華北作家協會的會員大會，是相當重要的，因爲他們正在這個時候某新會務，因此他們的組織也有些變動。根據他們所修正的會章而言，華北作家協會今後已改爲執行委員制，委員定十一名至十三名，內設首席委員一名（由陳綿當選），專務委員一名（由柳龍光當選），委員則有傳蕓于·沈啓无·梁山丁·張鐵笙·陳辛嘉·余白林·趙蔭棠·楊丙辰·陳魯風·陳少虬，王介人等，監察委員一人（由徐羽冰當選）。此外，他們更設有評議員及事務部，事務部部長一職，今已選由陳魯風擔任。在事務部方面，分爲總務·事業·編審等三組。同時爲便利研究起見，他們特設小說·評論·隨筆·詩歌·戲劇·古典文學·外國文學等七部門委員會。　　現在華北作家協會除刋行華北文藝業書之外，更發刋[中國文學]月刋等。剛在他們召開決戰文學者大會的一天，他們所創辦的[中華週報]也產生了，所以在那天出席的人大都人手一冊。中華週報在大體上說是一種較有希望的華北刋物，文章很是精美。華北方面作家的這種團結精神實在是堪以佩服的，尤其他們能以作家自身的力量爲文化界服務，或許是我們所應有所採取的必要吧。</p>
<h3>訪問北京市立九中</h3>
<p>在北京特別別市市長兼教育局局長劉玉書先生的口中，早就聽說這裹有一所市立中學很有特色，因此引起了我去訪問的心理。這便是北京市市立第九中學，在大東亞戰爭之前本是美國美以美會辦的一隻教會學校——滙文中學。以前，滙文中學在華北原是頂有名的，可是一般學生大都過着養尊處優的生活，自從新任校長蒯超先生到任後，爲時雖僅一年有半，但已被整理得井井有條，不愧爲事變後一位新興的教育家。據說在去年春季該校易長的時候，當時美以美會在北京的主教，會心拋到滙文的前途，殊不料自蒯氏任校長之後，迄今不但在校產方面增添了許多，就是一般學生的成績也超過了北京全體的其它中學。今日提到了北京的九中，誰也承認爲首屈一指的學校，連事變前一向居北京中學首位的師大附中，也有些趕不上哩！　　當然在我滯留北京的期間，是不能錯過這個機會，立即自市府出來坐車趕到船板胡同一號。最先給我的印象就很好，因爲市立九中的校址寬暢，以及樹木的蒼緣可愛。當記者去的時候，蒯校長還在上課，鐘鳴十二才見一位四十開外的男子推門而入，原來這便是蒯校長。他身上只穿着黑色的制服，腿上還縛着綁腿很有些軍人裝束的模樣。他一來便招呼我去看集團訓練，原來他們規定每禮拜六十二時至十二時四十分是全校學生齊集在大操塲上舉行集團訓練的時間。所謂集團訓練就是國民的軍事訓練，所以他們的教職員和學生都穿着制服，而教職員且縛有綁腿，很帶軍事化的氣息。　　在學校的大操塲上，立着一千多青年學子，完全聽著指揮官的命令，要有舉動便一起動作，每個人頭都像古木一般連動也不動。據蒯氏說，這乃是他任校長一年半後的一些小小成績。在集團訓練之後，編以行落旗禮，因爲他們在禮拜六的下午是休假的。他們每天早上八時舉行升旗禮，行過了升旗禮便早操。每天傍晚放學之前，都舉行集團訓練，集團訓練之後繼行落旗禮。集團訓練所注意的，乃是軍事動作，紀律與服從，故與普通的體操不同。在那天舉行落旗禮的時候，記者親眼看到那一千多位中國未來的棟樑，在號角中對燦爛的國旗行最警禮。那一瞬可愛的塲面，直不由我感到極大的衝動。據蒯校長說，他們辦學的重點，乃首先注重體育，然後始及於德育與智育，而其教育的方法則從此種集團訓練入手。自從他們實行集團訓練這後，全校學生的風氣已爲之一變，昔日養尊處優之貴公子氣，已完全蕩滌無存。尤其一般學生對於紀律與服從的觀念，得力於集團訓練者甚多。</p>
<h3>體育與智育並重</h3>
<p>今日的九中，對於體育雖特別注重，但於課程方面更較以前原有的嚴厲精神爲進步。蒯氏此次來長此校，對原有教職員都沒有更動，除於少數自動辭職者外，幾乎與過去的一般無二。可是蒯氏對學生課業的愛護也是值得一提的，譬如平日注重月考與口試，凡有舞弊者一律除名。而且每隻課室，都有十字形的空隙留在門上，以便蒯校長於上課時巡視。所以凡是任中學校長的，我可以相信決沒有再比蒯氏忙的了。他每週雖僅授課二三小時，但事無大小無不親自處理。不僅每天需巡視各班上課的情況，更須到病房去視察醫生診視有病學生的情況，到晚上更每日去巡察寄宿舍，有時且對學生有露體而睡的親自爲其蓋被　據蒯氏說，最近該校全體員生均舉行體格檢查，凡有患肺病的學生都令其退學，職員也強其休養，但原薪照給，而於工人患有肺病者也給以可恩賞令其去職。所以到現在爲止，他們這隻學校說是頂合手衛生條件的了。</p>
<h3>北京最近學校槪況</h3>
<p>最後，我在蒯氏口中，略知北京近日的學校槪況，茲特附載於后：　　北京今日的小學約有二三萬，最好的是師大附小與北京師範附小。中學市立的有二十一所，其中男中十所，女中六所，師範一所，職業學校四所。私立的有三十餘所，男中以平民中學爲最著，女中以光華女中爲最著。大學今日僅有北大，師大，中國大學與輔仁大學四所。北大約共有學生六千人，分文理法工理農六學院，師大共有學生二千餘人，中國大學分文理法三學院，是私立的，由何其鞏任教長，共有學生約三千人，輔仁大學是天主教辦的，共有學生約二千人。</p>

<h3>培里琉島敵美損失慘重松島部長談太平洋戰況</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（二十九）日下午二時半循例接見中國新聞記者，發表最近太平洋戰況，曁渝美勾結情形。茲誌談話於後：</p>
<h3>培里琉島敵軍大挫</h3>
<p>關於帛琉羣島之培里琉島方面戰事，目下仍在激烈展戰中，美軍損失非常重大，截至本月二十二日止，敵軍死傷人數計一萬二千四百名，以上數日，乃培里琉島一向南二七○米（三百碼）地內敵軍所受損失，若以之比較前次塞班島言面敵軍損失，更見重大。蓋在塞班島上敵方死傷人數，計一平方粁內有五十六名，而在帛琉方面，則一平方粁內有四百十三名死傷，如此龐大數目，實予敵方重大威脅。美軍因收容此次死傷人員，現已兩次派出一萬噸運輸船，此舉足證敵方損失重大。（在塞班島作戰時，敵美第一第七海軍陸戰隊幾全數毀滅，敵方對此事稱爲立功，然號稱陸戰猛將之里蓋納少將，對此實大感失望）。</p>
<h3>對日作戰極度困難</h3>
<p>根據二十六日歐洲梅洛涅電，敵西南太平洋聯合軍第三部隊司令官湯姆有萊克大將廣播稱：爲欲打倒日本，第一必需最高度戰力，又謂在進擊新幾內亞之兩旁道路上，日軍仍有九萬餘名，必須擊退此數日軍，方可完全克復，但此處日軍咸以死戰爲口號，由此可以明瞭敵方將校作戰時，感及極度困難。</p>
<h3>重慶始終執迷不悟</h3>
<p>關於前次到渝之美代表納爾遜，現已乘特快飛機返抵美國華府，納爾遜此次從重慶所帶回蔣氏批准條件書，內容未詳，想乃將渝政權所轄地區劃爲重工業地帶，作爲製造對日作戰武器事，若此實現，則中國必將成爲更慘酷之戰塲，中國民衆亦將蒙受最重大痛苦，然重慶政權始終未有覺悟，一貫[抵戰建國]之理想，誠恐將有[抗戰滅國]之一日。</p>
<h3>作家責難英美失策</h3>
<p>美國因謀本身安全，結果全國皆成戰塲，人民受苦殊甚，日本爲建設大東亞，旨在與中國人民以希望與幸福，敵美則予中國人民以死亡·根據廿四日倫敦電，美作家斯蒂威爾於上星期會在美週刋雜誌上著文，責難英美對日[大陸]戰略之失敗，乃重慶力量薄弱所致，然其另一方面則主張以武器供給重慶，吾人自可窺測其用意，不僅以武器供給渝方，實欲遂其使重慶變其製造武器工廠之陰謀。又蔣氏在最近[國民參政會]中，會說[在中國戰爭之決定階段，現已開始]，此語將使中國成爲更慘酷戰塲，但中國四萬萬五千萬人民，是否同作如是想法，實足吾人考慮。美軍在菲島作戰會作誇大宣傳，謂菲島之戰，實予日軍艦隊飛機以重大損傷，此說實爲狂語，查前次敵轟炸馬尼拉時，中國僑民受損甚大，又前次南京被炸，是亦徒使中國人民受損，日本毫無損傷，但敵美對此，絕無發表。</p>
<h3>法商電車市府准予加價公用局發表核准理由</h3>
<p>關於法商電車加價事宜，茲因該公司未奉當局核准，擅自增加，經市公用局之嚴令制止，與輿論界之抨擊，爲時未及一週，卒告恢復原價。茲悉該案已經公用局轉奉市府核定，准予加價，并通知該公司遵照矣。公用局方面特發表經過情形如下：查法商電車公用所請增加票價理由，據來呈稱：該公司於三十年八月份，會會同前法公董局研討足以維持收支平衡之收支比例，結果得每乙乘客平均收入○·一五元（即乙角五分）每行車乙公里費用一·三○元（即乙元三角）之互相比例，現佔計本年九月份每行車一公里之費用，增爲七十四元，計較三十年八月份高出五十七倍，而現在之票價收入，僅爲三十年八月份之二十四倍，按照前項比例，必須將票價照現行價格增加二·四倍，方能平衡收支，當按照此項數字，該公司會經歷來之計算，尚可置信，關於該公司與上海電車相較，因上海電車公司於成本中，不計折舊，所用補充材料，多屬軍管理處撥發，售價至廉，即需添購，亦可按官定價格購買，至電流一項，亦係上海電力公司供給，且該公司按月須繳納百分之五，營業稅於本府，對於職工待遇，視生活指數予以增加，亦較上海電力公司職工爲高，以上海電車公司改行分段制後，由靜安寺至楊樹浦須換車兩次，購票三次，法商電車迄未改分段制，一路可達，故該公司票價雖屬較高，實際兩相比較，所差甚徵，而支出遠較上海電車公司鉅大，則屬事實，本局依據以上理由，尚屬切實，爰將該公司所呈增加車資表，視實際情形，加以核減，頭等最高價爲十六元，最低爲六元，三等最高價爲十元，最低四元，經已呈奉府令核准轉知照辦</p>

<h3>學費解府困難請求當局收回成命</h3>
<p>— 一教師</p>
<p>九月二十四日各報刋載市教育局載局長鑒於各校教職員工因秋節在邇，盼望提前發放九月份經費，甚爲殷切，迭與市府及財局磋商，決於二十五日起分區發放的消息，每個事校服務人員當然是感激萬分的。　　可是事實上呢？所謂九月份經費者，薪俸一項，每教員仍是七百三十元。請想，以一個至少受過中等教育的小學教師，辛辛苦苦盡了一個月的教導責任，所得酬勞，還不夠買十個普通月餅的代價，若比諸富人家在公司中所買的月餅來恐怕還不過夠付一二個大月餅的特捐呢　　並且，聽說在領這可憐的七百三十元一名的薪俸時，須先把本學期指定爲專供改善教育從業人員待遇之用的學費，除二成半爲[姑念各校員工生活艱難，暫准存校借支]外，其餘七成半應先報解，始得具領。並且，這解局的七成半，須[俟各校報解齊全曁分配方案呈准市府後，各校應得分配確數，再行飭知]。加薪未有着落，特配米尚在辦理手續中，已收學費又得繳解，則此七百三十元之爲用大矣哉！　　但我們究不能餓着壯子上教室，揑着書本忘家人的。所以在開學之初，就向校長再三情商，借得了一筆說小不小的款子去安家，同時再要求校長購備足供同人一學期應用的柴米。校長是體恤我們的，就一一答應了，我們除了感激外，當然祇有努力於本身職務，來答謝他的誠意。如今教局要催解學費，我們看到校長愁眉不展的樣子，各人正躭心着校長急得沒法可想時，會不會把存儲的柴米賣了去奉令？如果眞是這樣的話，那以後的日子怎麼過呢？　　所以我們要求陳市長垂念我們生活艱難，工作繁重，收回學費解府的成命，免得我們因校中萬一作賣米解款之計時，生活上大起恐慌。同時，請市長諭示戴局長，迅行調查各校收費確數，訂定支配辦法，即日公佈施行，而加薪辦法，亦早日宣布，以安全體教師工役之心。萬不能再蹈上學期接受學生家長生活補助費後那種收解發放的覆轍——各校繳局後，隔數星期始發放，且提成部份，有一說至今尚無下文呢？物價是不斷的高漲，低微的員工薪餉，實在再也經受不起風浪的襲擊了。</p>

<h3>雷雨（八）</h3>
<p>[我認爲若告訴你，你就不能畫圖了，所以就特意沒告訴你。]　　回到報道部房間去時，飛田中校悲痛地這樣說。　　隆夫覺着喉嚨比眼睛更快地充滿了熱淚，而一句話也說不出來了。　　[谷是偉大的軍人呵！……偉大的死呵……偉大的……]　　飛田中校的慢言慢語，突然話不成聲，而低下頭去了。　　情不自禁的隆夫，就放聲大哭了。像小孩子一樣，鳴咽的聲音始終不停了。　　[你怎麼了？]　　同事Ｔ囑託跑到隆夫傍邊來。飛田中校用眼色告訴他，Ｔ就抱着隆夫，拖到他的狹仄辦公室去了。　　[呵，原來你是谷少校的知已！]　　其他囑託也接着跑到隆夫的房間來安慰他，而他伏在賓具零亂的棹子上，背在一蹤一蹤地動着。　　並非只是悲痛眞人的死，而才哭的。他佩服那樣溫和的眞人，建立了永垂不朽的武動，竟後悔不知道眞人是那樣的偉男子，而未曾更親近一些，同時感到自己有那樣偉人的朋友，非常高興——眞是萬感交集，而才使他痛器流泣的。　　他的哭過於沉痛，所以同屋的兩位囑託也只好出去了。剩下一個人的他，便盡情地繼續哭下去。　　（拜託飛田中校介紹我到報道部來任職，這或許是眞人對我的最後紀念。）　　想到此處時，愈發增加了新的淚泉。於是在心板上又映出在吳鎭分手時眞人的面孔來。　　最後他又想起妹妹的事來。眞人陣亡的消息，用無綫電向全國宣佈的時候，可以不難想像到妹妹是會受到如何的精神打擊。　　（妹妹的希望永久沒有了。然而這是一件極小的事。）　　他揮着淚這樣想。　　當心境鎭靜時，他立刻跳出自己的房間，而跑到黑潮會的辦公室去了。照像製版已經完畢了。隆夫凝視着自己畫的夜襲圖。不大工夫，他發出可驚的聲音來。從潛艇上露出半截身體來的士官，就是眞人的像。然而這種姿態，完全是眞人在潛水學校的六號艇上露出來時的印像。隆夫在不知不覺中，竟畫出眞人的像來。（一四六）</p>

        <h1>1944.09.30</h1>
<h3>Emphasize Reality</h3>
<p>What is reality? It is [the actual state of affairs before one's eyes]. The evolution of reality inevitably has its objective factors. If one does not emphasize reality, if one does not emphasize the objective factors in the evolution of the state of affairs, then handling the state of affairs easily becomes fantasy. Fantasy is different from ideals. Ideals have their objective theories. However, ideals that disregard reality, ideals that do not approach reality, are already not easy to realize. How much more so fantasy that neither considers reality nor has a theoretical basis?</p>
<p>The policies of the government, especially the decisions of government orders, if they cannot take into account reality, do not value the demands of the people, and do not value the sufferings of the people, then they become empty talk, which is equivalent to fantasy. It can even harm the people in the opposite way. Therefore, if the government decides on policies and orders without going through deliberation and research by representative bodies, it is not easy to obtain the widespread understanding and support of the people, forming a phenomenon where the government is for the government, and the people are for the people. Let's take an example.</p>
<p>In the political aspect, improving administrative efficiency and establishing a clean government are the responsibilities of the government anytime, anywhere. However, if the treatment of civil servants is not taken into account, then all plans to improve administrative efficiency and establish a clean government are empty talk. Secondly, establishing security is even more necessary during wartime. However, if the treatment of the military and police is not taken into account and they cannot be made to work for their duties with peace of mind, then the expectation of establishing security is not easy to achieve in practice. If local security cannot be established and administrative efficiency cannot be improved, local politics cannot get on track, and central politics will have no power. If central politics has no power, local politics will of course be unable to advance. Therefore, the fact that the current salaries of civil servants and military and police cannot maintain their livelihoods is reality. If this reality is not valued, even if there are various handling methods, the result is inevitably fantasy.</p>
<p>In the economic aspect, increasing production has become a unanimous demand without question. However, if realistic problems that hinder increased production, and even lead to reduced production, are not resolved first, simply putting forward attractive slogans will ultimately not help the facts. What are the realistic problems? Such as insufficient funds, insufficient raw materials, inconvenient transportation, too much red tape, etc. Secondly, stabilizing people's livelihoods is even more a matter of course. However, the biggest problem in people's livelihoods, the price of goods, has always been high, especially the price of rice, which is the most important, has recently been skyrocketing. The insufficient allocation of household rice is already one factor in the high prices on the black market, and the recent ban by the Rice Control Committee on the transportation of rice over eight kilograms is an even greater factor stimulating rice prices. Therefore, within three to five days of the announcement of the ban on transportation, the black market price of rice rose by another 30%. Only measures that stimulate the rise in rice prices can be announced, but measures that suppress the decline in rice prices cannot be announced. For example, we have repeatedly pointed out in the past that such methods that disregard reality should be decided solemnly. All handling that does not value reality and only relies on subjective arbitrary decisions will ultimately become fantasy. After it becomes fantasy, the authorities are of course unaware and insensitive, while the general public cries out in misery. How can one not be careful?</p>
<p>We have repeatedly advocated promoting Shanghai as a model political area. If we do not emphasize reality and start with establishing security and improving people's livelihoods, then it will also become fantasy. When we say emphasize reality, of course we do not mean excessively accommodating reality. If we say that reality is an illegal act, of course we cannot recognize the illegal act because it is reality. However, we must know the reality behind the formation of illegal acts, and then correct them in order to be truly effective.</p>

<h3>Japanese Garrison on Peleliu Island Still Secures Central Highlands; Truk and Davao Islands Attacked</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a Japanese base in the central Pacific, the enemy on Peleliu Island is actively repairing the airfield. The Japanese garrison still secures the central highlands area, preventing enemy attacks. Furthermore, enemy vessels anchored in Kossol Passage disappear at night and reappear at dawn. On the 27th, the enemy suddenly launched about 30 anti-submarine attacks in the passage, after which the vessels hurriedly retreated.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from a central Pacific base, on the morning of the 26th, several enemy four-engine large aircraft attacked Truk Island.

<h3>Account of the Fierce Battle of the Japanese Army in the Longling Area of Yunnan Province</h3>
<p>Yunnan Front, 29th (Central News Agency) – The main points of the fierce battle of the Japanese garrison in the Longling area under the heavy encirclement of the Chongqing army for more than 60 days are as follows: When the 6th Division of the 11th Group Army of Chongqing, equipped with American weapons, came to attack Longling in late May, the Chongqing army planned to capture Longling City in one fell swoop. Therefore, on July 14, it sent 60,000 troops to occupy Dongshan, north of Longling. Subsequently, artillery fire was gradually increased. At the same time, with Dongshan as the center, Longling was surrounded. As a result, the surrounding positions of Longling gradually fell into its hands. Finally, direct assault began. The transportation team and scattered soldiers of the Japanese army position in western Longling were completely destroyed. The Japanese soldiers had to expose their entire bodies to fight fiercely. Because the Chongqing army had too many troops, the Japanese defenders had no choice but to reorganize their battle lines and gather about 200 remaining soldiers to resist with all their might. On August 24, the Japanese army in Longling City was almost unable to move during the day under the heavy encirclement of the Chongqing army. Because the Chongqing army's sniping and bombing were particularly fierce, the Japanese army could only eat once every two or three days. Later, because the food supply was cut off, they had to fill their stomachs with wild grass. The houses in the city were either bombed or destroyed, and the flame throwers were burned. The seriously wounded Japanese soldiers also rose up to fight in this predicament, either transforming artillery shells into hand grenades or digging deep trenches to replace houses. Their miserable plight was almost indescribable. However, although the Chongqing army suffered heavy casualties, it was still continuously adding new troops. In addition, the Chongqing army's artillery fire became more intense, so the Japanese army's casualties in the city gradually increased. A certain garrison commander also decided to burn important documents and equipment. On the same day, a quick report was received that Japanese scouts had appeared far outside the city. At that time, the morale of the Japanese defenders was greatly boosted. Early on August 28, the reinforcement team of Miyazono broke into the city, and the Japanese defenders of Longling were able to rest.</p>

<p>Peiping, 29th (Central News Agency) – The character of Peiping in the year and a half after the National Government joined the war has changed.

<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Baoqing City in Central China, Takes Danzhu Airfield in South China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 p.m. on the 29th: ○ Japanese troops in central China, after occupying Quanxian and Daoxian, continue their advance. At the same time, they launched an attack on Baoqing, an important stronghold of the remaining Chongqing army in Hunan, at dawn on September 27 and completely occupied it that evening. ○ Japanese troops in South China, after occupying Rongxian and Wuzhou, continue their advance. On the evening of September 28, they occupied the Danzhu airfield, a base of the Chongqing-American air force.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Front Line, 29th (Central News Agency) – On the 27th, after the Japanese army launched a general offensive against Baoqing, which was guarded by the 100th Army of the Chongqing army, it eliminated the Chongqing army's side defense heavy weapons and mortar positions, and captured the south wall of the city at 8:00 a.m. The Japanese army, which was attacking fiercely from the east, also captured the city at noon, taking the main position of Baoqing into their hands and cutting off the lifeline of the 57th Division, which was defending Baoqing City. After that, the Japanese troops rushed into the city and engaged in a fierce street battle. At 2:00 p.m., Baoqing City was completely occupied, and the city was cleared at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Front Base, 29th (Central News Agency) – A unit of the Japanese army that went north from Rongxian crossed the West River near Doutouxu (25 kilometers northwest of Danzhu) and completely occupied Pingnan, a strategic point on the opposite bank of the West River, at 7:30 a.m. on the 28th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chengdu Airfield</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base in China Front Line, 29th (Central News Agency) On the night of the 26th, a Japanese bomber squadron took advantage of the moonlight to launch a surprise attack on the Chengdu airfield in Sichuan Province. They dropped bombs on the runway and surrounding areas, destroying seven B29 aircraft of the Chongqing-American Air Force parked on the ground and causing three explosions at the airfield facilities. As a result, the base of the Chongqing-American Air Force B29 aircraft has been completely destroyed. That night, the Japanese squadron further raided Chengdu. One of the Chongqing fighter aircraft took off to intercept after learning of the Japanese aircraft's arrival, but still failed to prevent the Japanese squadron from attacking Chengdu. However, when the Japanese squadron arrived in Chengdu, the weather gradually deteriorated. Suddenly, it rained heavily in the sky over Chengdu, making the view very blurry. One Japanese command aircraft immediately attacked the Chongqing airfield in the heavy rain. At that time, the heavy rain suddenly stopped over the Chongqing airfield, and the bright moon illuminated the north-south runway and its surrounding large guide roads, making them shine brightly. However, the Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fire did not show any activity. This situation is truly a miracle. After the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on the northeast side of the runway, the second batch of Japanese aircraft dropped huge bombs on the southwest and west sides of the airfield, causing red and black flames to erupt at two eastern guide road facilities and two western guide road facilities, which are believed to have been caused by the destruction of aircraft by bombing. At that time, the fourth and fifth batches of Japanese aircraft directly aimed at the flames of the airfield and continued to advance east along the runway. After a while, at a height of 500 meters under the wings, they found large four-engine aircraft and B29 aircraft lined up in the shelters of the eastern guide road. After the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on them, they quickly ascended. At that time, two Chongqing airfield facilities had already caught fire, and three other facilities were rising with smoke from the explosions. Other Japanese aircraft also successively descended rapidly to bomb. After the Japanese bomber squadron successfully bombed Chengdu, they all leisurely flew back to their original defenses.</p>
<h3>Ten Enemy Aircraft Shot Down Over Wuzhou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese base, 29th: Chungking-U.S. air forces, feeling the threat of the Japanese military, in order to implement a counteroffensive and reverse the declining situation, specially used a joint formation of twenty B24-type aircraft and more than thirty P51-type fighter-bombers on the 28th to launch a large-scale attack on the Japanese front lines in the South China area, bombing areas near Sanshui (40 kilometers west of Guangzhou). The Japanese fighter squadrons immediately engaged them, and by a little after 2:00 PM, they had shot down five P51-type aircraft and one B24-type aircraft near Wuzhou. The total result was the shooting down or destruction of ten enemy aircraft, and the remaining enemy aircraft fled in disarray. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft also gloriously self-detonated.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Liuzhou Airfield</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from the Japanese front lines, 29th: Japanese bomber squadrons carried out a night air raid on Liuzhou airfield on the 28th, braving intense anti-aircraft fire from the ground to launch a fierce attack, destroying two enemy large aircraft and three small aircraft, as well as damaging another small aircraft, completely destroying its taxiway. The entire squadron then safely returned to base. Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base, 29th: Japanese bomber squadrons launched a surprise attack on Liuzhou airfield on the night of the 27th, bombing Chungking-U.S. aircraft parked on the field. The results of the battle were as follows: nine small aircraft were bombed, and one large aircraft and four small aircraft were destroyed, totaling fourteen aircraft. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base, 29th: Japanese dive bomber squadrons have been dispatched continuously in recent days to launch surprise attacks on the Chungking-U.S. Air Force's front-line base groups in Jiangxi Province, as well as the northeastern Guangxi region, a crucial communication point for Liuzhou, cutting off the Chungking military's retreat routes on the eastern Chinese coastal area. On the 26th, a unit of Japanese dive bomber squadrons braved the rain to launch a surprise attack on Hexian, about 100 li north of Wuzhou, shattering a warehouse. On the morning of the 28th, they attacked the Babu goods accumulation point, 20 kilometers west of Jiaxian, hitting it with bombs and causing a fire. This area is the only rear communication and supply route for the Suichuan-Ganzhou base groups. Due to the fierce bombing by the Japanese military, the enemy's retreat route is, in fact, under threat.</p>
<h3>Western Front War Enters Stalemate; German Border Defenses Show Their Power</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 28th: The German military finally achieved a decisive victory in the fierce fighting in the northern part of the Western Front. The British First Airborne Division was completely annihilated on the 26th, and the anti-Axis forces' attempt to break through the Siegfried Line from the Netherlands and continue into the Ruhr industrial area was completely crushed. The German military continues to exert its maximum power in the border defense war in western Germany. Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 29th: The situation on the Western Front has now reached a slight stalemate. Fierce fighting continues in the areas of the Luxembourg border, Nancy in eastern France, and Luneville. Currently, more than 2.5 million troops from both sides are concentrated along the entire line from the Netherlands in the north to northern France and the Swiss border, and the overall situation is likely to change greatly. Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: German News Agency: On Wednesday, the scale of the fighting between southern Holland and the Bougen-gate was smaller than in the previous few days. The American command is making every effort to send reinforcements to the front line and strengthen its extended supply lines. The focus of the American offensive is roughly Aachen-anti-Metz, where powerful mechanized and tank units of the enemy have been concentrated. The American command has apparently abandoned its attempt to open the Bougen-gate from the north.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Forces in Northern Italy Adopt Pincer Offensive</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: DNB News Agency: The focus of the anti-Axis forces' offensive on the Italian front is in the areas of Rimini, Sant'Arcangelo, and Firenzuola. The right wing of the British Eighth Army is attempting to advance northwest through the narrow strip of land between the Apennine Mountains and Lake Massaciuccoli. The left wing of the British Eighth Army and the right wing of the American Fifth Army are jointly advancing northeast, attempting to join forces in the Imola-Faenza area. Under favorable circumstances, the anti-Axis forces are adopting a pincer offensive, which may encircle the left wing of General Kesselring's troops. In order to avoid encirclement, the German military must retreat from the isthmus of mountainous and lagoon areas to the Bologna-Argenta line. However, although the anti-Axis forces have enormous troop strength and ample war equipment, they can only make the German military retreat gradually. The anti-Axis forces have only achieved local victories in places such as the Futa Pass and the vicinity of Monte Beni.</p>
<h3>Focus of Eastern Front War Shifts to Hungarian-Romanian Border; German Troops Continue Withdrawal in the North</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 29th: DNB News Agency: The resistance of the German military on the Eastern Front has strengthened, and the Soviet authorities' planned attack on Riga and the coastal area, as well as the encirclement of the German forces on the Northern Front, has not been realized. A large number of Soviet troops are concentrated there, along with 1,000 tanks. The extrication movement of the German military in the Baltic region is continuing under the cover of rear guard troops, and the Soviet military is closely pursuing them. The Soviet military is also intensifying its attacks on East Prussia, but without any success to speak of. The situation in the central sector is slightly relaxed. The claim by Polish rebel leader Bor that he has controlled all the suburbs of Warsaw does not correspond to the facts, because the troops in the southern suburb of Norgatov have already surrendered. After losing twenty infantry divisions and four tank regiments, the Soviet military has not yet transferred reserves to replenish them. It is expected that the Soviet military will transfer troops from the interior or other battlefields to invade Slovakia, in order to carry out a pincer movement against Hungary. The Soviet military is now shifting the focus of its war to the Hungarian-Romanian border.</p>
<h3>Churchill Reports on War Situation in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 29th: German News Agency, according to London sources: Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, reviewing the current war situation, stating that the Normandy campaign was one of the greatest campaigns in the entire war. The number of British and American troops currently in France is between one million and three million. After 120 days of fighting, the ratio of British troops to American troops in France is four British divisions to five and a half American divisions. More than 90,000 British troops have been killed, wounded, or gone missing, while the American military's losses are more than 145,000.</p>
<h3>European War Likely to Be Prolonged</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister continued, "We should not expect the immediate cessation of the war. In his opinion, the end of the war is still several months away." Regarding foreign policy issues, Churchill strongly emphasized that the British-American-Soviet alliance is closer than before. In the event of territorial changes occurring on the Polish border, Britain will provide assistance to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's demand for a secure border and [friendly countries] next to its western border is reasonable. Regarding this issue, Mikolajczyk and his colleagues in the Polish government-in-exile will soon reopen negotiations in Moscow.</p>
<h3>Three-Headed Conference to Be Held at Year's End</h3>
<p>Regarding the Dumbarton Oaks Conference, a satisfactory agreement has not yet been reached. He strongly emphasized the necessity of a [Three-Headed Conference], but this conference must be held after the American presidential election. The time of the conference will be in December, and the location has not yet been decided. Churchill declared after completing his speech that he would discuss with President Roosevelt many issues regarding the conduct of the war, as well as what steps should be taken to enable Stalin to join the triangular conference as soon as the military situation permits.</p>
<h3>The Cultural and Educational Circles Under Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>-- Wu Gong</p>
<p>As a member of the cultural world, coming to the old capital inevitably involves contact with the cultural figures here. I have become acquainted with several of them in the past two years through meetings related to news and propaganda, but most of them I have never met face to face. A few days ago, when I went to visit Mr. Liu Longguang at the Wude Newspaper Office, he expressed his hope that I could attend their Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress. Sure enough, on September 23rd, they sent an invitation card inviting me to go, and naturally, the next morning, I could not avoid visiting it.</p>
<h3>Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress</h3>
<p>The so-called Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress was actually organized by the North China Writers Association, and its purpose was to promote the awareness of decisive battle literature and advance the national literature movement, in order to fulfill the mission of cultural figures under the decisive battle. In addition to the entire membership of the North China Writers Association, consisting of more than 200 people, there were local Chinese and Japanese reporting authorities, as well as representatives from the cultural world. The congress began at around 10:00 AM, chaired by Qian Daosun, the recently resigned president of Peking University. After passing a resolution to complete the victory of the decisive battle, the Writers Association presented the North China Literary Awards. This year's winners included Ma Li's [The Lament of Taiping], Yang Bao's [The Return to Life], Lei Yan's [Good Fields], Xiao Ai's [Collection of Duckweeds], Mu Yimang's [Nightingale's Song], and Wang Luo's [May You Live a Long Life]. Only Ma Li won the first prize, receiving a prize of 1,000 yuan, while the rest received prizes of 200 yuan. On that day, speeches were delivered at the venue by Guan Yixian of the Information Bureau and Chen Zaiping, Director of the Propaganda Bureau of the Xinmin Association, followed by speeches by guest representatives. In addition to Sun Runyu, chairman of the film company, as a guest representative, Mr. Liu Longguang temporarily requested a journalist to speak once. Then, Director Takeda of the Reporting Department gave a lecture on the current situation, explaining the trends of the decisive battle in great detail. After lunch, Dr. Fujisawa Chikawo, Director of the Fujisawa Research Institute, gave a lecture, the main point of which was to explain how to use Chinese Taoism to remedy today's Western utilitarian concepts. After Fujisawa's lecture, the third membership meeting of the Writers Association continued.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Writers Association</h3>
<p>This membership meeting of the North China Writers Association was quite important, because they were at this time establishing new association affairs, so their organization also underwent some changes. According to the revised articles of association, the North China Writers Association will henceforth be changed to an executive committee system, with eleven to thirteen members. It will have a chief committee member (elected by Chen Mian) and a full-time committee member (elected by Liu Longguang). The committee members include Chuan Yunyu, Shen Qiwu, Liang Shanding, Zhang Tiesheng, Chen Xinjia, Yu Bailin, Zhao Yintang, Yang Bingchen, Chen Lufeng, Chen Shaoqiu, and Wang Jieren. The supervisory committee member is Xu Yubing (elected). In addition, they have also established a council and an administrative department. The position of head of the administrative department has now been selected to be Chen Lufeng. The administrative department is divided into three groups: general affairs, business, and editorial review. At the same time, for the convenience of research, they have established seven departmental committees: fiction, criticism, essays, poetry, drama, classical literature, and foreign literature. Currently, the North China Writers Association not only publishes North China Literature and Art, but also publishes the [Chinese Literature] monthly magazine. On the day they held the Decisive Battle Literary Scholars' Congress, their [China Weekly] newspaper, which they founded, was also launched, so most of the people who attended that day had a copy in hand. Broadly speaking, China Weekly is a more promising North China publication, and the articles are very exquisite. The solidarity of the writers in North China is truly admirable, especially their ability to serve the cultural world with their own strength as writers, which may be a necessity that we should adopt.</p>
<h3>Visiting Beijing Municipal Ninth Middle School</h3>
<p>I had already heard from Mr. Liu Yushu, the Mayor of Beijing Special Municipality and Director of the Education Bureau, that there was a municipal middle school here that was very unique, which aroused my desire to visit it. This is Beijing Municipal Ninth Middle School, which before the Greater East Asia War was originally a missionary school run by the American Methodist Episcopal Church—Huaiwen Middle School. In the past, Huaiwen Middle School was very famous in North China, but most of the students lived a life of pampered ease. Since the arrival of the new principal, Mr. Kuai Chao, although only a year and a half has passed, it has been organized in a well-ordered manner, worthy of being a rising educator after the Incident. It is said that when the school changed principals last spring, the Methodist Episcopal Church's bishop in Beijing at the time was pessimistic about the future of Huaiwen. He did not expect that after Kuai took over as principal, not only has the school's assets increased a lot, but the academic performance of the average student has also exceeded that of all other middle schools in Beijing. Today, when Beijing Ninth Middle School is mentioned, everyone acknowledges it as the leading school, and even the Beijing Normal University Affiliated Middle School, which had always been at the top of Beijing's middle schools before the Incident, is somewhat falling behind! Of course, during my stay in Beijing, I could not miss this opportunity, so I immediately left the municipal government and took a car to No. 1 Chuanban Hutong. My first impression was very good, because the campus of Municipal Ninth Middle School was spacious and the trees were pleasingly verdant. When the reporter arrived, Principal Kuai was still teaching. Only when the bell rang at twelve did a man in his forties push open the door and enter. This turned out to be Principal Kuai. He was wearing only a black uniform, and his legs were wrapped in puttees, giving him the appearance of a soldier. As soon as he arrived, he invited me to watch the group training. It turned out that they stipulated that every Saturday from 12:00 to 12:40 was the time for all students to gather on the large playground to conduct group training. The so-called group training is the military training of the citizens, so their faculty and students all wear uniforms, and the faculty even wear puttees, giving it a very militarized atmosphere. On the school's large playground stood more than a thousand young students, completely listening to the orders of the commander. Any movement had to be done together, and everyone's head was as still as an ancient tree, not even moving. According to Kuai, this is some small achievement after he has been principal for a year and a half. After the group training, there was a flag lowering ceremony, because they had a holiday on Saturday afternoons. They hold a flag raising ceremony every morning at 8:00 AM, and after the flag raising ceremony, they do morning exercises. They hold group training every evening before school is dismissed, and after the group training, they continue with the flag lowering ceremony. The group training focuses on military movements, discipline, and obedience, so it is different from ordinary gymnastics. On the day the flag lowering ceremony was held, the reporter personally saw those more than a thousand future pillars of China saluting the shining national flag in the sound of bugles. That moment of adorable scene directly made me feel extremely moved. According to Principal Kuai, the focus of their schooling is to first emphasize physical education, and then to focus on moral and intellectual education, and their method of education starts with this kind of group training. Since they implemented group training, the atmosphere of the entire school has changed, and the pampered airs of the former wealthy young men have completely disappeared. In particular, the general students' concepts of discipline and obedience owe much to group training.</p>
<h3>Equal Emphasis on Physical and Intellectual Education</h3>
<p>Today's Ninth Middle School, although it pays special attention to physical education, is even more advanced in terms of the original rigorous spirit of the curriculum. Kuai's coming to head this school this time did not change any of the original faculty members. Except for a few who resigned voluntarily, they are almost the same as in the past. However, Kuai's care for students' studies is also worth mentioning. For example, he usually pays attention to monthly exams and oral exams, and anyone who cheats is expelled. Moreover, every classroom has cross-shaped gaps left in the door so that Principal Kuai can inspect during class. So, of all the middle school principals, I can believe that none are busier than Kuai. Although he only teaches two or three hours a week, he handles everything personally, no matter how big or small. Not only does he need to inspect the teaching situation in each class every day, but he also needs to go to the infirmary to inspect the doctor's examination of sick students. In the evening, he goes to inspect the boarding house every day, and sometimes he personally covers the students who sleep nude. According to Kuai, the entire faculty and students of the school recently underwent physical examinations, and all students with lung disease were ordered to drop out, and staff members were also forced to take a break, but their original salaries were paid as usual, and workers with lung disease were also given a compassionate dismissal order. So, so far, they say that this school is the most suitable for hygiene conditions.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Schools in Beijing Recently</h3>
<p>Finally, I learned a little about the general situation of schools in Beijing recently from Kuai's mouth, which is specially attached below: There are about 20,000 to 30,000 elementary schools in Beijing today, and the best are the Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University and the Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Normal University. There are 21 municipal middle schools, including 10 male middle schools, 6 female middle schools, 1 normal school, and 4 vocational schools. There are more than 30 private schools. Among the male middle schools, Pingmin Middle School is the most famous, and among the female middle schools, Guanghua Girls' Middle School is the most famous. Today, there are only four universities: Peking University, Beijing Normal University, China University, and Fu Jen Catholic University. Peking University has about 6,000 students, divided into six colleges: liberal arts, science, law, engineering, science, and agriculture. Beijing Normal University has more than 2,000 students. China University is divided into three colleges: liberal arts, science, and law. It is private, with He Qigong as the head of the school, and has about 3,000 students. Fu Jen Catholic University is run by the Catholic Church and has about 2,000 students.</p>

On that day, the charitable seats at the Grand Cathay will be sold for 300 yuan, and the public welfare seats will be sold for 200 yuan, all sold by the theater's ticket office. In order to promote popularity, tickets for the drama performance will be sold at half the current price. Those from all walks of life who wish to see the famous plays can purchase tickets in advance from the two theaters. This is both watching a famous play and doing a good deed, truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>

<h3>Purchasers of Old Land Deeds Ordered to Make Provisional Registration</h3>
<p>Recently, land prices in the special district of this city have been rising, and speculation has been rampant. In order to rectify the situation, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau previously issued a notice prohibiting the sale and purchase of land with old deeds. However, investigations have revealed that some landowners are still reselling land in secret, leading to situations of double sales of land and original owners requesting supplementary certificates after the land has already been sold, as well as various other disputes. Moreover, the deeds often have flaws, and whether the land corresponds to the deed cannot be determined without the Land Administration Bureau's detailed examination of the maps and records. It is understood that the bureau, in order to prevent property disputes, is still prohibiting the sale and purchase of land with old deeds. In order to thoroughly rectify land administration, landowners who have already completed transactions of land with old deeds are ordered to bring their evidence of ownership and the original contract to the bureau's central district office before the end of this year to apply for provisional registration in advance, in order to facilitate collection and sorting. In addition, the bureau has issued a notice that those who intend to enter into agreements for the sale and purchase of land with old deeds in the future should jointly apply to the bureau for a certificate change and complete the transfer registration after signing and confirming the maps.</p>

<h3>Health Check-ups for University Students</h3>
<p>Gu Nanqun, Director of Nanyang Hospital, wrote: [University students are the elite of academic institutions, and in the blink of an eye, they become the backbone of the nation and leaders of society. Their health is a matter of great importance and profound significance for their own careers and the future of the nation and society. Furthermore, to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of this great era and the future reconstruction, good health is particularly important. Considering my role as a physician serving society, I previously organized free health check-ups for primary school students from a medical perspective, which has been ongoing for over a month and is still continuing. Now, I am organizing free health check-ups for university students receiving student aid. Starting on October 11th, ten students will be examined each day from 2:30 PM to 5:00 PM, excluding Sundays and public holidays. Those undergoing the examination should first obtain a form from your newspaper's student aid office, fill out the required sections, register at the social services department of our hospital according to the scheduled date and time, and the department will send them to various departments for examination. If any illnesses are found, we will arrange treatment to ensure their health. I am sending the form for your review and printing for use.] We are deeply grateful to Director Gu of Nanyang Hospital for his kindness in organizing free health check-ups for university students. We hope that this year's student aid recipients will register at the office starting October 4th with their registration certificates in order to be assigned a number and scheduled date for examination.</p>
<h3>Heavy Losses for the Enemy on Peleliu Island: Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China met with Chinese journalists yesterday (29th) afternoon at 2:30 PM, as usual, to discuss the latest Pacific War situation and the collusion between Chongqing and the United States. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<h3>Major Defeat for Enemy Forces on Peleliu Island</h3>
<p>Regarding the battle on Peleliu Island in the Palau Islands, fierce fighting is still ongoing. The US military has suffered very heavy losses. As of the 22nd of this month, the enemy's casualties totaled 12,400. These figures represent the losses suffered by the enemy within 270 meters (300 yards) south of Peleliu Island. Compared to the enemy's losses on Saipan Island, the losses are even more significant. On Saipan Island, the enemy's casualties were 56 per square kilometer, while on Palau, the casualties were 413 per square kilometer. This enormous number poses a major threat to the enemy. The US military has dispatched 10,000-ton transport ships twice to accommodate these casualties, which demonstrates the severity of the enemy's losses. (During the battle of Saipan, almost the entire US First and Seventh Marine Divisions were destroyed. The enemy called this a great achievement, but Major General LeGendre, known as a fierce marine commander, was greatly disappointed by this).</p>
<h3>Extreme Difficulties in Operations Against Japan</h3>
<p>According to a Europe Meloni telegram from the 26th, Lieutenant General Tom Holcomb, commander of the Third Division of the US Southwestern Pacific Allied Forces, broadcast that to defeat Japan, first, the highest level of combat power is required. He also said that there are still over 90,000 Japanese troops on the flanks of the advance on New Guinea, and these troops must be defeated before complete recovery is possible. However, the Japanese troops there are fighting to the death, which makes it clear that the enemy generals are experiencing extreme difficulties in operations.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Remains Obstinately Unenlightened</h3>
<p>Regarding Nelson, the US representative who recently visited Chongqing, he has returned to Washington, D.C. by express plane. The contents of the conditions document approved by Chiang Kai-shek that Nelson brought back from Chongqing are not detailed, but it is assumed that the area under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing government will be designated as an industrial zone for the manufacture of weapons for the war against Japan. If this is realized, China will inevitably become an even more brutal battlefield, and the Chinese people will suffer the greatest pain. However, the Chongqing government remains unenlightened and adheres to its consistent ideal of "resisting aggression and building the nation." It is feared that there will be a day of "resisting aggression and destroying the nation."</p>
<h3>Writers Blame Britain and the United States for Miscalculations</h3>
<p>The United States, in seeking its own security, has resulted in the entire country becoming a battlefield, and the people are suffering greatly. Japan, in building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, aims to give the Chinese people hope and happiness, while the enemy United States gives the Chinese people death. According to a London telegram from the 24th, the American writer Stillwell wrote an article in an American weekly magazine last week, blaming the failure of the British and American [mainland] strategy against Japan on the weakness of Chongqing's power. However, on the other hand, he advocated supplying Chongqing with weapons. We can see his intention, not only to supply weapons to Chongqing but also to fulfill his conspiracy to turn Chongqing into a factory for manufacturing weapons. Furthermore, Chiang Kai-shek recently said at the [National Political Council] that "the decisive stage of the war in China has now begun." This statement will turn China into an even more brutal battlefield, but whether the 450 million Chinese people share this view is worth considering. The US military made exaggerated claims about the operations in the Philippines, saying that the battle in the Philippines caused significant damage to the Japanese fleet and aircraft. This statement is delusional. Previously, when the enemy bombed Manila, the Chinese overseas suffered great losses. And the previous bombing of Nanjing also caused damage only to the Chinese people, with no damage to Japan. However, the enemy United States has never made any announcements about this.</p>
<h3>French Tram Concession Granted Fare Increase by the Municipal Government: Public Utilities Bureau Announces Reasons for Approval</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the French tram fare increase, because the company had not obtained approval from the authorities and increased fares without authorization, it was strictly prohibited by order of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and criticized by the press. In less than a week, it was restored to the original price. Now, it is understood that the case has been transferred by the Public Utilities Bureau and approved by the Municipal Government, and the fare increase has been approved, and the company has been notified to comply. The Public Utilities Bureau has issued the following explanation of the process: The French tram concession's reasons for applying for a fare increase, according to its submission, stated: In August of the 30th year [1941], the company had discussed with the former French Municipal Council the income-expenditure ratio sufficient to maintain a balance of income and expenditure, and the result was that the average income per passenger was 0.15 yuan (i.e., 15 cents) and the cost per kilometer of operation was 1.30 yuan (i.e., 1 yuan 30 cents). It is now estimated that the cost per kilometer of operation in September of this year has increased to 74 yuan, which is 57 times higher than in August of the 30th year, while the current fare revenue is only 24 times that of August of the 30th year. According to the previous ratio, the fare must be increased by 2.4 times the current price to balance income and expenditure. Based on these figures, the company's calculations over time are credible. Regarding the comparison between the company and the Shanghai tram, because the Shanghai Tram Company does not include depreciation in its costs, and most of the replacement materials used are allocated by the Military Management Office at very low prices, even if they need to be purchased, they can be purchased at official prices. The electricity is also supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and the company must pay 5% of its business tax to the Municipal Government every month. The treatment of employees is increased according to the cost of living index, which is also higher than that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's employees. After the Shanghai Tram Company switched to a segmented system, it is necessary to change cars twice and purchase tickets three times from Jing'an Temple to Yangshupu. The French tram has not yet changed to a segmented system, and you can reach your destination in one trip. Therefore, although the company's fare is relatively high, in actual comparison, the difference is very small, and the expenditure is far greater than that of the Shanghai Tram Company, which is a fact. The Bureau believes that the above reasons are realistic, so the company's submitted fare increase table was reviewed and reduced according to the actual situation. The highest first-class fare is 16 yuan, the lowest is 6 yuan, the highest third-class fare is 10 yuan, and the lowest is 4 yuan, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and notification.</p>
<h3>Japanese Advisor to the Ministry of Justice Visits the Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Jiu Li Tian Yixi, advisor to the Judicial Administration Department, accompanied by Secretary Meiwei of the Japanese Embassy, visited the Shanghai Local Court at 10:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Defective Siren Causes False Alarm Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters, the air raid siren that sounded at 4:30 PM yesterday (29th) was a false alarm due to a defective siren.</p>
<h3>Reduced Remittance Fees in Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Due to the extreme difficulty in supplying funds to the Shaoxing Post Office in the past, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau increased the remittance fee to 51 yuan per thousand yuan to regulate the situation. Now that funds have been secured for the Shaoxing Bureau, the remittance fee has been reduced to 26 yuan per thousand yuan starting from the 25th of this month. Both telegraphic and postal remittances can be quickly cashed, which is extremely convenient.</p>

<h3>Russia Wins Sino-Russian Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>The Sino-Russian volleyball match was held for the third time yesterday afternoon at the Qing Fitness Room of the Ba Xian Overseas Chinese Middle School.

In conclusion, Russia defeated Qing with three straight sets: 15-11, 15-11, 15-12.</p>
<h3>Soccer Game Postponed</h3>
<p>The friendly soccer match between Donghua and the German merchants, originally scheduled for 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the Yiyuan Stadium, was postponed to 10:00 AM this weekend at the same location due to the continuous autumn rain yesterday morning, which made the field wet.</p>

<h3>Difficulties in Paying Tuition Fees: Requesting Authorities to Withdraw Order</h3>
<p>— A Teacher</p>
<p>The news published in the newspapers on September 24th stated that Director Jian of the Municipal Bureau of Education, noting the eagerness of the teaching staff of various schools for the early disbursement of September funds due to the approaching Mid-Autumn Festival, had repeatedly consulted with the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Finance and decided to distribute them by district starting on the 25th. Every staff member of the schools was naturally extremely grateful. But what is the reality? For the so-called September funds, the salary item is still 730 yuan per teacher. Just imagine, a primary school teacher who has received at least a secondary education and has diligently fulfilled a month's teaching responsibilities, the reward they receive is not enough to buy ten ordinary mooncakes. Compared to the mooncakes bought by wealthy families in companies, it is probably not enough to pay for the special tax on one or two large mooncakes. Furthermore, it is said that when receiving this pitiful salary of 730 yuan, 75% of the tuition fees designated for improving the treatment of education workers this semester must first be handed over to the bureau, and only 25% can be "temporarily allowed to be stored in the school for temporary use due to the difficult living conditions of the staff of each school" before the salary can be claimed. And this 75% handed over to the bureau must be "[after all schools have reported and the distribution plan has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval, each school should be informed of the exact amount to be distributed]." Salary increases are not in sight, special rice allocations are still being processed, and tuition fees that have been collected have to be handed over. How useful is this 730 yuan? But we cannot go to the classroom hungry, clutching books and forgetting our families. So, at the beginning of the semester, we repeatedly asked the principal for a loan, not a small amount, to settle our families, and also asked the principal to purchase enough firewood and rice for the colleagues to use for the semester. The principal is sympathetic to us and has agreed to each request. In addition to gratitude, we can only work hard in our own duties to thank his sincerity. Now that the Bureau of Education is urging the handover of tuition fees, seeing the principal's worried expression, everyone is worried that when the principal is so anxious that he can't think of a way, will he sell the stored firewood and rice to comply with the order? If this is really the case, how will we live in the future? Therefore, we ask Mayor Chen to have compassion on our difficult living conditions and heavy workload, and withdraw the order to hand over tuition fees to the government, so as to avoid a major panic in our lives when the school sells rice to hand over the funds. At the same time, please instruct Director Dai to quickly investigate the exact amount of fees collected by each school, formulate a distribution method, and announce and implement it as soon as possible, and announce the salary increase method as soon as possible, to reassure the hearts of teachers, workers, and servants. We must not repeat the same mistake as last semester's acceptance of student parents' living subsidies - after each school handed them over to the bureau, they were not distributed until several weeks later, and some say that there has been no news about the commission part so far? Prices are constantly rising, and the meager salaries of the staff really cannot withstand the storm.</p>
<p>— Written by Iwatata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<h3>Thunderstorm (8)</h3>
<p>[I thought if I told you, you wouldn't be able to draw, so I deliberately didn't tell you.] Lieutenant Colonel Tobita said sorrowfully when he returned to the reporting department room. Ryuo felt his throat filling with hot tears faster than his eyes, and he couldn't say a word. [Tani is a great soldier! … A great death… Great…] Lieutenant Colonel Tobita's slow speech suddenly became incoherent, and he lowered his head. Uncontrollably, Ryuo burst into tears. Like a child, the sobbing never stopped. [What's wrong with you?] A colleague T, a clerk, ran to Ryuo's side. Lieutenant Colonel Tobita gestured to him, and T hugged Ryuo and dragged him to his cramped office. [Ah, so you are Major Tani's confidant!] Other clerks also ran to Ryuo's room to comfort him, and he lay on the chaotic table, his back moving in jerks. It wasn't just sadness at the death of a real person that made him cry. He admired that gentle real person, who had established immortal martial achievements, and regretted that he didn't know that the real person was such a great man and hadn't been closer to him. At the same time, he felt very happy to have such a great friend - it was a mixture of emotions that made him cry so bitterly. His crying was too painful, so the two clerks in the same room had no choice but to leave. Left alone, he continued to cry to his heart's content. (It was probably the real person's last remembrance of me that made Lieutenant Colonel Tobita introduce me to the reporting department to take up a position.) Thinking of this, it added a new spring of tears. Then, the face of the real person at the parting in Wuzhen was reflected on his heart. Finally, he thought of his sister. When the news of the real person's death was announced to the whole country by radio, it was not difficult to imagine what kind of mental blow his sister would suffer. (My sister's hope is gone forever. However, this is a very small matter.) He thought this while wiping away tears. When his mind calmed down, he immediately jumped out of his room and ran to the Black Tide Society office. The photographic plate was already finished. Ryuo stared at the night raid drawing he had drawn. Before long, he let out a startling sound. The officer sticking half his body out of the submarine was the image of the real person. However, this posture was exactly the impression when the real person was sticking out of the No. 6 boat at the submarine school. Unconsciously, Ryuo had drawn the image of the real person. (146)</p>
<h3>Yongnian Tai Chi Class to Hold Opening Ceremony Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>In order to promote physical education and develop traditional Chinese martial arts, our organization is holding a Huizhong Fitness Class, temporarily setting up a Yongnian Tai Chi Quan group, and has invited Mr. Chuan Zhongwen to serve as a voluntary instructor. Mr. Chuan named the class Yongnian in memory of his maternal grandfather, Yang Chengfu, a modern Tai Chi Quan master of Yongnian. Since the start of registration, the number of people joining has been extremely enthusiastic, which shows that the general public has a very strong interest in Tai Chi Quan. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on October 1st (Sunday) at the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association, No. 98 Nan Tong Road. Those who have received the approval notice from our organization are requested to bring the letter and report on time, which is very important.</p>
<h3>Mooncake Charity Sale Continues</h3>
<p>The Guanshengyuan Food Company has donated 200,000 yuan from this charity sale of mooncakes to the Shen Xin two newspapers to help students and relieve poverty. Due to the enthusiastic promotion of charitable people from all walks of life, they have all been sold out. Yesterday, we learned that a Mr. Anonymous had independently ordered ten "Peaceful Years" mooncakes, totaling 100,000 yuan, and the Xin Yi Enterprise Company had ordered one "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake, totaling 6,000 yuan. In order to encourage the charity act, the company, although it had been completely sold out, did not want to disappoint them, so it rushed to produce them overnight so that they could be delivered before the festival. The enthusiasm of the two gentlemen for charity is commendable, and the original target of 200,000 yuan has exceeded more than half, which is especially gratifying. The day before yesterday, Mr. Chai Xinfu also purchased a "Three Pools Mirroring the Moon" mooncake for 6,000 yuan. The money has been handed over to our office by the company, bringing the total to 100,000 yuan. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Yiyou Medical Clinic Provides Consultations</h3>
<p>In view of the high cost of everything, the Yiyou Hospital Temporary Clinic provides free consultations and affordable medicines in line with its aim of serving the community, and also provides medicines for surgery. Recently, due to the surge in patients, the number of patients who do not see doctors every day has reached as many as seventy or eighty people. Therefore, starting from August 21st, additional doctors have been hired to increase service hours. The clinic hours have been revised to start from 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM every afternoon (the original clinic hours were from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM). Now, we are honored to receive 500 consultation coupons, instructed to distribute them to the poor and sick. In addition to complying, we would like to express our gratitude.</p>
<h3>Sixth Obligatory Smoking Cessation Program Begins</h3>
<p>The sixth group of ten people in the special obligatory reform and smoking cessation program attached to the Zhongjiao Daoyi Association held a reception ceremony at the association's auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. More than 30 guests from all walks of life attended. Mr. Zhang Xiaobai chaired the meeting, and the ceremony was simple and solemn. Recently, our organization purchased [Saint Kang Ping] injections from the Hua Sheng Chemical Factory for a cost of 10,000 yuan and donated them to the smoking cessation center, and also donated 10,000 yuan for the renovation of the wards. All of these funds were allocated from our organization's medical aid funds to spread blessings for all donors.</p>
