<p>南京二十日中央社電　司法院長溫宗堯，於二十日上午恭赴汪故主席靈前致祭。</p>
<h3>任援道就任　兼保安司令職</h3>
<p>蘇州二十日中央社電　江蘇省省長兼保安司令任令援道氏，昨日上午蒞臨保安司令部，正式就任兼保安司令職，並對該部人員訓話，　勉奉公守法，保閭安民等語。下午二時，偕司令參謀長楊彥斌，會同第二師長任祖萱，視察第二軍保安敎育團整訓處等各軍事機關，當對保安敎導團全體敎宮學員訓話，語多昮勉，至下午五時始畢。</p>
<h3>渝桂林防衛軍　已全部潰滅　俘虜一萬三千餘</h3>
<p>桂林二十日中央社電　桂林攻略作戰，渝軍棄屍達五千六百餘旦，俘虜達一萬三千餘名之衆。其後經調查判明，除防衛桂林之第三十一軍長自殺，第一百三　十一師長戰死外，俘虜中有副師長旅長聯隊長等幹部多人。是故桂林渝防衛軍已完全潰滅殆盡。蓋桂林防衛軍，於第十六集團軍副軍長韋雲淞指揮下，以第三十一軍所屬之第一百七十一師，一百八十八師之大隊，及第四十六軍第一百七十師，桂林市管區之補充二聯隊等二師二聯隊，且大隊共約二萬名，編成大軍。配以重砲與山砲等，從事防衛工作。渝當局雖嚴命死守桂林，但於日軍總攻擊之下，至十日，此等渝軍竟告潰滅。當日晨，擬由城內脫難之第三十一軍長以下主力，亦被日軍追擊殲滅。第三十一長賀維珍中將，因係失守桂林之直接接責任者，自思絕難逃避渝方之處置，故是日於城外西南山中自殺。第一百三十一師長關維繼中將，及第四集團軍總司令總高級參謀陳濟幽，九日均於城內戰死。俘虜中更有第四十六軍第一百七十師副師長巢威少將，及上校三名，中校七名，少校八名等幹部人員。綜觀渝軍棄屍及被俘人數，即可明瞭渝桂林防衛軍已完全潰滅矣。</p>
<p>宜山北方　追擊渝軍</p>
<p>宜山西方日軍某基地十九日中央社電　日軍部隊攻潰家山後，更分成數隊，對四分八散敗逃之渝軍十五師，猛烈追擊，不予以整頓之上睱。計十六日傍晚，於宜山北方約十公里之觀愛龍頭附近，追擊擬由宜山向天河（宜山北方三十公里）方面脫逃之敵第二十一軍主力，於宜山西南方二十公里永定河北方，追擊第九十三軍之一部，與第三十八師。更於懷遠附近，追擊第二十七師之主力，刻正分別展開壯烈之戰滅作戰中。</p>
<p>桂林上空擊落美機</p>
<p>桂林二十日中央社電　十八日下午二時三十分許，美戰鬥P51P40共十六架，自南北兩方，圖向桂林上空侵入，日防空砲火，當即集中攻擊，擊落P40型機二架，將之擊退。</p>
<p>金城江北運輸失效</p>
<p>大陸地二十日中央社電　黔桂鐵道之渝軍，遭日軍連續猛擊，狼狽潰走，桂林柳州基地羣之物　，亦集中金城江附近，圖向貴陽方面搬運，因桂林柳州陷落過於迅速，故金城江以北之運輸，難如計畫推進，故日軍迅速抵達宜山後，已由宜山北方至貴陽間之鐵道上，有江載兵丁物資之火車數十節，左右馳騁，混亂已極。十七日十八日　　，被日機炸毀七節，金城江附近要衝之鐵路綫，復遭日軍切斷，目下宜山金城江間之鐵路綫，百公里失去運輸效能。</p>
<p>美司令懼進攻貴陽</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據重慶電，美新任駐渝司令官韋特米爾，十八日接見記者稱，余就任以來，與蔣介石會見數次，曾就今後對日作戰，建議簡單而完全之計劃。余自信不久當可克服反軸心之困難，日本今後進擊之目標，係自柳州南下，藉謀與越南之日軍取重聯絡，或自柳州方面西進攻擊貴陽。依地勢而言，此事勢勞難成功，然吾人仍應於各種想像內，速謀充分對策。</p>
<p>廣西日軍迫近懷遠</p>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據含衆社駐重慶訪員十九日訊，廣西戰況如左：重慶軍司令部十九日夜，承認日軍沿黔桂鐵道向西北挺進，迫近懷遠鎭（柳州西方八十六里。）並承認日軍左翼部隊，於十七日佔領忻城（柳州西南六十四公里。）一方日軍自寶慶西進，貴省極感威脅可能。故重慶當局承認日軍十七日到達寶慶西方廿九公里之地點，料該方面日軍之目標，必在進取芝江。（湖南省西部通達貴陽之要衝。）</p>
<h3>汪主席遺訓</h3>
<p>（一）我們第一要吃苦，不能吃苦的人，必不能康潔，不能廉潔的人，必不能爲國爲民。</p>
<p>（二）只要方向是對的，那末我們的努力，必有成功之一日</p>
<p>（三）中國獨立自由之完全獲得，必於東亞解放中求之。</p>
<p>（四）艱難困苦愈大，也就是我們的責任愈重。</p>
<h3>納卯雅浦空襲　擊落敵機一架</h3>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地二十日中央社電　十八日白晝，有敵機三十架來襲納卯。十七日白晝，敵機二十五架來襲列加斯比。</p>
<p>中部太平洋是日軍某基地二十日中央社電　敵俯衝轟炸機累計二十五架，十八日來襲雅浦島，被日機擊落一架。</p>
<h3>太平洋初度　魚雷艇戰</h3>
<p>里斯本二十日中央社電　據紐約泰晤士雷伊泰島前綫消息，哨戒於該島西岸奧爾莫克灣之美軍魚雷艇隊，十七日至十八日夜，與日軍快速魚雷艇隊遭遇，西南太平洋初度之魚雷艇戰於此展開，但對已方損失未予發表。</p>
<h3>英美蘇渝磨擦　日見表面化　反軸心陣綫內部分化</h3>
<p>（中央社訊）自　爲反軸心四强之英美蘇渝，內部芥蒂叢生，不啻同休異夢，蓋目美駐渝司令長官史蒂威爾及高斯大使，最近憤然返美後，美渝間衝突，殆已無可掩敝，即重慶直接之政治系統方面，亦承認英美蘇渝，最近外交上之磨擦實情。查大東亞戰爭爆發，美國神經</p>
<p>一時失常　而在當初，英國亦正日夜躭　德國有跨過海峽，衝進英倫之勢。同時蘇聯大量土地亦可能速即落於德國手掌之中，斯時英蘇兩國，爲保自身起見，即起速度的將美羅斯福總統，邀請至戰爭第一綫上。在表面上，美國遂榮譽地擔任此次歐亞大戰之主翁。在重慶方面，本已焦頭爛額，</p>
<p>危在旦夕　乃乘大東亞戰爭之機會，走進白宮，坐上反軸心會議席上，惟以美國神經失常，故亦不再追究重慶究有多少力量，及渝政維究竟有否眞正統洽能力，而竟認渝方爲有力夥伴，希望在太平洋作戰時，重慶能在大陸作戰，牽制日本。然而不勝失望，美國已爲重慶所驅，但美未嘗不想</p>
<p>運用壓力　再派遣特使專使訪渝，控轉乾坤。無如重慶所染病症嚴重，在事實上無可藥救，在內不能團結，對外不能抗戰，湘桂一戰，美國一恨而撤回史蒂威爾及高斯，其原因即在於軍事政治上之</p>
<p>錯綜複雜　情形如今的美國，大有啞子吃黃連，有苦說不出之槪。當羅斯福在競選第四屈總統之前，不得不轉變政策，對重慶尤敢怒而不敢言。一面利用同病相憐之英國邱吉爾，在英下院大放歐詞，痛說重慶，略說重慶始終爲機會主義者，在反軸心作戰中，根本未盡</p>
<p>任何力量　相反地消耗反軸心軍實貴軍火不少，而英美之援助，足以加强重慶延安之對立。渝蔣以下文武官僚，更感失望，絲毫不想實行民主政治，而邱吉爾在痛斥重慶之後，極認眞地提出特戈爾之偉大，幷向反軸心國會議提義，重行討論特戈爾政府地位之必要。渝自獲悉英國之責備後，深感</p>
<p>萬分嚴重　幷竭力向美國解釋，一面向延安再表示讓步。同時向英國提出聲辯，渝政權曾數度商討英國如何遺棄重慶，理由幷非同情美國，在太平洋上單獨作戰，而爲躭盧戰後中國地位，英國自知命運</p>
<p>將受牽動　而英亦明白本身在此次戰爭中，殖民地將恐難保。如今坎拿大已成爲美國化，印度已成爲東亞化，新嘉坡香港各地均成了問題，故英國之壓制重慶，乃謀將來殖民地之保全。故中國將來之强盛，殊爲直接影響英國殖民地之生存。英美</p>
<p>資本主義　國家之立場，對中國見解一致，蘇聯是否不干涉遠東，十分之九是否定的，故英美先發制人對延安表示好感，以觀蘇聯態度。且要求史太林對太平洋戰爭明白表示見解，在史則認爲時機成熟，大可利用，先向美要求軍火租借條約繼續三年，同時蘇允許爲美發表言論，承認太平洋戰爭美已有合理地位。</p>
<h3>巴莫激勵　緬留日學生</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　滯此之甸緬國家代表巴莫氏，二十日上午十時於軍族會館招待緬留日學生約百名，席問巴莫氏發表演說約三十分鐘，激勵各生之擊滅英美，建設大東亞之決心。</p>
<h3>印非政黨委會討論現行政局</h3>
<p>盤谷二十日中央社電　海通社引新德里消息，甘度非政黨委員會，現已召開一會議，討論印度現行政局及解決各種難題之途徑，會議歷時二日，昨由沙浦魯主席開幕，會中將選出二十人，共同研究所有少數問題及其解決辦法。</p>
<h3>德保衛疆土　完成新防綫　美軍佔領蓋稜克要塞</h3>
<p>西綫二十日中央社電　海通社訊：西綫要塞建築之第二期四週計劃亦已完成，本年九月初反軸心軍逼近德邊界時，希特勒元首即令沿當時已存在之戰綫，建立鞏固要塞綫，當擬就建築之四星期計劃，繼見第一期計劃於深度方面尙未足用，乃有二期四週計劃之實施，賴舉國人民之努力，卒於原來防綫後，完成鞏固之新防綫後，完成鞏固之新防綫數道。諸凡砲台及拖蔽壕　，莫不爲最新式者，總之，此等新防綫較大西洋之鋼壁更見堅固。</p>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社迅：亞琛大戰第四日，美第九軍於亞琛之北，突入德軍主要防綫，佔領蓋稜克，現續向東北推進中。又美第三軍自進入　勃隆後，戰事正在梅茲外國南部進行，梅茲外國防綫東北美軍左電愈益迫年德國舊界，　爾之華特維士村·尼德河西之布林道夫一帶，均有激戰</p>
<h3>蘇軍積極準備　冬季大攻勢　爭奪洪都激戰中</h3>
<p>柏林二十日中央社電　海通社訊：東綫氣候漸趨嚴寒，泥濘之道路已有開始凍結者，預料蘇軍之冬季大攻勢，不久即將發動。德機偵得那萊夫河·東普賢魯士間·直至柯蘭區爲止，蘇軍均在大事準備中。洪京布達佩斯與米考爾資問，戰事益趨猛烈，敵以三十五師之衆，沿廣大戰綫進攻，德洪軍正力抗中。敵於洪京東及米考爾資南突破數處，一度進入哈特　　南之吐拉，但未幾又經我軍逐退。</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>民族測騐</h3>
<p>一個民族的獨立和自主是要從血汗中苦鬥出來的。我們讀日本的近代史，看到日本自從受到美國潘萊侵入以後，所受到的壓迫恥辱等等事實，所訂立的一切不平等條約，正和其他東亞民族在百年來所受的一般無二。可是日本民族忍辱負重，刻苦耐勞，從最艱苦的環境中奮鬥，終於創立一個獨立自主的國家，與英美分庭抗禮，使英美人尊敬和欽佩，其間政府和國民，上下一心，耐勞苦的經歷，百折不回的勇氣，眞是可　可泣。</p>
<p>現在盟邦日本不但以一國的獨立自主爲滿足，更進而領導東亞全體民族，共同作解放的奮鬥，希望獲取整個大東亞民族的獨立自主。要求解放是大家的心念，特別在中國，孫中山先生所主張的大亞細亞主義，本質就是大東亞的獨立自主和互助，所以中國國民更感到與奮鬥愉快。中國國民一方面看到日本民族奮鬥成功的歷史，同時一方面回想以往的先烈，苦心積慮，和英美侵略者的苦鬥，現在認定目標，繼續先烈遺志，忠貞努力，正是最最適當而又最便利的時機。</p>
<p>族是有經騐的，日本民族汗血的經騐造成光榮的歷史，這是其他民族的先驅，是其他民族的借鏡。過去日本國家的解放，是單獨測騐日本的民族，在這個測騐裏，日本民族的優秀性已經昭示於世界。現在東亞的解放，是整個測驗大東亞民族的，在這個測驗裏，大東亞民族的優秀性，一定也可以昭示於世界，步武着日本國家的解放，必可使大東亞解放成功。</p>
<p>因爲是民族的大測驗，所以在測驗場上，各個國民都要謹愼小心，聚精會神，堅忍刻苦地應付。我們先要立定民族的自信，我們要保持過去的優秀性，我人要坦白地承認自己的弱點。東方民族的優點在乎堅忍耐苦，百折不回，這是日本和中國的民族性，這在測驗場上，我們更要特別發揚，我們更要堅忍，我們更要耐苦，我們過去以這個優點維持民族數千年的生存，現在我們以這個優點造成民族永久的解放。其次，我們的弱點就在工業化的不足，因爲東方民族過去都是度着農業化的安定生活，直到近百年來，因爲歐洲工業革命的結果，受到他們的侵略，然後覺悟到工業化的重要而方才建設起工業化的社會，所以在歷史上，我們工業化的程度比較落後。但是日本以「迎頭趕上」的精神，以不滿百年的時間，利用最新的方法，不但已經追上，而且還能比英美猛進。現在到了民族測驗場中，中國民族更應該特別努力。此外，抵抗英美的侵略，日本是有經騐的，日本和英美交手了近百年，對於英美的心理和力量，更是瞭如指掌，這個經驗是我們的指南針，我們要依着指南針的方向，邁步猛進。</p>
<p>國家存亡，緊於民族，民族存亡，緊於國民本身，這是大東亞國內每個人應當時常記着的。</p>
<h3>陳代主席訓話　本旣定政策邁進</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　汪主席於民國二十九年三月，揭　和　平反共建國三大政綱，還都南京，至於本年十月，凡四年有七月。不幸殂逝，舉國震哀。公博受命於汪主席離國養病之日，今復被推負責於痛悼之餘，不敢以才輕任重，而輕改追隨主席之初衷，亦不忍在國步艱難之時，而諉其責任。凡汪主席手定之政策，皆爲公博奉行之政策，凡汪主席生前之設施，皆爲公博現在之設施。今當視事之頃。謹掬所懷，而要求國民政府同人，及全國軍民，共同努力以赴。</p>
<p>始終反對帝國主義</p>
<p>第一，中國國民黨在民國十三年改組，發布第一閃全國代表大會宣言。對外政策，首主取消不平等條約。國父逝世遺　，亦促諸同志，務於最短期間，實現廢除不平等條約，用以昭示國人。此皆國父曁中國國民黨同志，代表全國人民反對帝國主義，而求中國自由平等之一貫夙志。民國十四年三月，國民政府成立於廣州，即倡單獨反英，乃至去年一月九日，參加大東亞戰爭，悉本夙昔反對帝國主義之旨趣，以求中國解放、自大東亞戰爭展開以後，英美雖慶經挫敗，對華之非法利益，迄無取消之意圖。最近英國國務大臣，且在下院有英國無意放棄香港之宣示，可知英美帝國主義一日不倒，中國以及全東亞絕無解放之可能。國民政府於去年參加大東亞戰爭，爲主義而戰，爲解放而戰，更爲國父之大亞洲，主義而戰。無論戰事如何推移，時局如何迫切，全國軍民，決不動搖。今後大東亞各民族爲進一步之協力，以爭取最後之勝利，良以反對帝國主義，爲國民政府之夙志，亦爲全國人民之決心，本人決意勇往邁進，成敗鈍，在所不計。</p>
<p>達到和平統一目的</p>
<p>第二，國民政府還都之目的，在於祈求中日之全面和平下，進而求全東亞之和平，此心此志，汪席與國民政府始終一不懈，以求實現。還都之日如此，今日如此，今後亦　如此。國民政府自始即無與重慶敵對之心，重慶之人民，亦即爲國民政府之人民，重慶之同志，亦即爲吾人之同志。吾人自始即以爲和平亟須實現，國家終不可分，耿耿於心則爲全國所共諒。數年以來，初與日本設立中日基本第約，繼而復訂中目同盟條約，並參加大東亞宣言。中間復承日本之協力，得以收回租界，撤廢治外法權，此皆國民政府對外以誠，確　睦鄰之基。對內以信，蔪求統一之實。今後國民政府，決本汪汪席之遺志，以求達到黨國不可分，而亟須統五偉大志願，無論如何艱基，必使完成。尙望全國軍民，一致努力，同此主張，使中日復歸於和平，而國家復歸於統一。</p>
<p>澄淸吏治崇尙廉潔</p>
<p>第三，國民政府還都以後，時愕屢更。初因中日事變尙未完全解決，繼因大東亞戰爭終於展開，政府瘁力於百年大計，遂不免忽於地方吏治，檢討以往，無可訹言。負各方面之責者，或以官吏生活困難，略迹瞻徇，或以僚屬過去勛勞，原情減罪·循至吏治日壞，政務不修·吾人須知和平救國爲國民之天職，無功足言，信賞必罰，爲立國之大綱，不明則忘，現在人習痛苦深矣，匯共滋擾，荊棘載途。益以貪污，國將不國，自今以後，國民政府決意澄淸吏治，以副汪主席昭示廉潔政治之初衷。倘有茶毒人民，妨害國本者，無論何人，當認爲民賊，與衆棄之。</p>
<p>增加生產注重民需</p>
<p>第四，欲求完成大東亞戰爭，勢必注重生產。本年無旦汪主席有增加生產之訓言，吾人本此遺訓，必須付諸實施，縱以戰時原料動力發生種種困難，亦必努力繼續生產，使軍需民需變方並重。吾人須知軍需固居首要，而民需亦不容漠視。蓋民需不繼，必致民生不安，必致整個生產陷於停頓。邇時軍需民需兩受其困，欲求勝利馬德望道未田。此則亟盼全國軍民體念此旨，通力合作，統籌兼顧。</p>
<p>確立治安修明政治</p>
<p>第五，確立治安，亦爲汪主席之遺訓，但治一之確立，固在軍事之邁進，尤重在政治之修明。自今以後，軍事政治務宜配合，負軍事之責者，應肅正紀律，整飭敎育政治之責者，應崇尙廉潔，實行建設。必使地方寗淸，民有所歸，此後事政兩方，務必身體力行，使地方治安，得以確保，而國基得以鞏固。</p>
<p>凡此所舉，皆爲廿日決定之方針，而爲今後實行之綱目，吾人憶已往有確定之政策，而未能充分表現實踐之熱誠，今後務宜一洗泄沓之風，勵致求實之引。更有進者，國家之樹立，完全在於自力更生，政府不建築於人民之上，基礎必難强固。所望同人本於自發之精神，以求國家之獨立。益以堅忍之志，排除倚賴之心，則中華可以復興，而東亞亦可以保矣。區區之誠，願與國民政府同人，及全國軍民共勉之。</p>

<h3>與曹汝霖爐邊對談（二）</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>二十一條與西原借款</p>
<p>二十一條是袁世凱任大總統時代所簽訂的，說是二十一條，實則後經刪改，僅承認十五六條。其中最重要的是關於過去東三省的開發和雜居問題，然而即以此一問題而論，也只承認租借權，且尙規定其僑民須遵守我國當地法律。據曹氏說，只要這樣其實中日人民雜居也不成問題的，譬如我國在國外有很多的僑民，尤其在南洋各地且尙握有當地的經濟大權，但他們大都須遵守當地法律，便不會對當地有害的。何況我國關於一切產業的開發，無不需要日人相助，則這個雜居問題或亦不無對我有利。他對於袁世凱是十分佩服的，當他那時接到了外長陸徴祥關於日方提出這個要求之後（曹氏時任外次），他們就連夜去見袁氏。袁氏時適就寢，陸氏當即入內報告，曹氏則候於室外，不十分鐘陸即出室，曹氏當時大爲驚奇。陸氏乃報告見袁情況說：「大總統連這個通牒看都沒有看，只說我在一個月以前就料到日本有這一舉動，現在只存兩條路：戰或和。戰是絕對不可以的，且日本當時實在也沒有戰意，那末你們就馬上去和日本公使談判吧」其實後來二十一條簽訂後，始終沒有實行，因爲事後袁氏便策動美國干預東省，結果造成了日後的華府會議九國公約。</p>
<p>西原借款是曹氏日後任財政總長兼交通總長時所經手的借款，那是民國八九年的事。那時歐戰告終，日本寺內內閣很想協助我國的統一和建設，可惜當時的北洋政府實在太昏庸無能了。那是怎麼一回事呢？起初爲了整理交通銀行需借款五百萬元，已經和大倉商討好了，只是爲了條件太苛才停頓下來。當時適有一位日本的商人姓西原的來華，聽到了便毅然慨諾十足借款，因爲從來向外國舉債總有折扣，而此次是十足，且並沒有條件，只提出以曹氏任交通銀行的總理。因此便成立了這項關於交行的借款。事後曹氏便時與兩原連絡，由此使我國實現統一而從事建設，可惜北洋政府完全把這筆錢做了政費，統一事業毫無成就，建設事業才就根本談不到了。據曹氏說，當時的北京政府僅靠關餘和鑒稅爲收入，海年前者不過七千萬元，後者不過二千萬元，所以統計不到一萬萬元。至於西原借款的重要性在那裏呢？這實在是中日最初友好合作的一個實踐佳例。當初本想由日本協助我國統一後，把奪時的東三後開發，一切物資先儘我國應用，有餘則賣給日本，試問這難道還不是有害於中國的嗎？</p>
<p>烽火聲中再談參戰</p>
<p>中國已經渡過了兩回世界戰爭，在上一次大戰中，它是和日本立於同一立場上的。不幸這次的世界戰爭，戰場固然波及整個東亞，而中日兩國却又立於兩個絕然不同的立場上，雖然自國府還都後今已和日本結成了同生共死的戰友。曹氏談到了這個問題。顯然地他的深心裏一定有不少的　涌。他說，那時中日兩國本是互相說好了共同參戰的，雖有靑島方面的軍事行動，可是兩國關係原極友好。所以當大戰結束，我國派遣和會代表赴歐過日時，日本原擬大規模招待我國的代表團。當時北京當局原亦擬派曹氏爲代表之一，但因他不　歐美語言面辭去。那時的代表國首席爲陸徴祥氏，其他有顧維鈞施肇基等，王正廷因屬　方國民黨的代表，所以也被聘爲代表團顧問</p>
<p>日本與中國同屬協約國之故，在我國代表國過日時不僅預備熱烈招待，且在別　　署的天皇還特地幹回東京，預備該見中國代表團。當時一切已經安排定了，滿以爲中日關係由此可以立出一個增進的始基了。可是船到了日本，中國代表團不知道爲什麼忽然變卦，一面稱病，一面便不肯上岸，最後僅和日本當時的外相見了一面。尤其荒謬絕倫的，他們携帶的一雙重要公事袋忽然不翼而飛，所準備的材料遂完全化爲烏有，以致到了巴黎弄得手忙脚亂，這是擲到中日關係的一個最初暗影吧！</p>
<p>因此，我國便日漸與日本離心，爲了一個靑島問題，幾乎鬧得落花流水。其實當時日本早與我國訂立協定，待戰後交還我國，且於日軍佔領之時，事後亦已把警權交還了我國，戰後也僅希望　一租界而已。但是那批代表們，爲了出風頭起見，竟主張把靑島交於和會，再由和會交還中國。鬧到最後，那時的美國威爾遜總統在我國代表哭訴之下，亦意愛莫能助，以我國已與日方簽約於先爲借口，也希望我國和日本直接交涉，事後，顧小川便以此事責曹氏，以至讓成那時曹氏住宅被羣衆打毀，所謂五四運動。記者聽了這段話，再想一想我國外交當局在此次戰前一味以兩國問題提付國聯解決的陳事，便可以格外明白，時間雖然相隔有一二十年，但在外交上毫無謀略，則依然如故，台嘆孰甚！</p>
<p>拿新路來打開中日現狀</p>
<p>曹氏昌上海人，記者和他講話時，他也滿口滬語，眞使我動起鄕情來了。他身處很健碩，我們後來還談到國家的前途，對於一般　薄的樂觀論者實在抱有杞憂。他是實踐中日提携的一位政治家，他深恨過去辦中國外交的人沒有遠大的眼光而僅就一時着想，因此把國家弄到如此田地。此時他雖尙優遊林泉，但在和記者作熱烈的談話神情中，很容易看出他並不是一位消極的人。記者當時就問他道：「中日現狀能以一條新路來打開嗎？」他說：「新路就是一個誠字。」如何使雙方都具有誠意，這確是我們此時所應注意的問題吧！記者在今天上午和竹田報道部討論想思問題時，就提出過一種見解，以爲雙方要有誠意，必先要有一種新的思想來結合兩大民族才成。</p>
<p>最後，記者還順便問問他關於井陘煤礦的情況。據他說，井陘煤礦完全是出的烟煤，所以是軍需的重鑛。爲了這樣有關軍需的應用，今正不斷在增產之中。不過對於這一點，他希望醫諒解民需有同樣重視的必要，而不合理的統制尤盼能毅然放棄。！可是現在煤礦的工人待遇，却比較好得多，每個人每天無價配給麵粉三斤，家屬每天配給麵粉一斤半，以四人爲限，此外還有日用品及煤，所以薪水雖然只有每月數十元，但比了此間中下公務員反而要舒服得多。據說，有一次某地警局去抓了些工人去做工，當時大家甚方害怕，但是一月歸來却平空每個人都分得了半匹布和一袋麵粉（四十斤），大家就無不歡天喜地了！</p>
<p>這樣的談話，實在再講兩個小時都不覺厭倦，不過時光業已太遲，記者便在暮色蒼茫中告別！（寄自北京）</p>

<h3>土田公使訪問記</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>當記者北來的時候，我的一位同行的老友就和我提及過北京盟邦使館的土田參事官。據說他是日本外交界極有希望的一位新進人物，與重光外相兼大東亞相，最屬知交。到北京以後，爲了俗務傯忙竟忘了到使館去拜訪他，這固然是一件遺憾的事。可是自從我在這裏的報紙上讀到了土田參事官調任盟邦駐滬公使的消息，自然便不能再行延遲下來，馬上決定想在他到任前去訪問一次。</p>
<p>故舊深爲借別</p>
<p>土田公使只有一個單名，呌做「豐」，在北京盟邦使館任職已有六七年之久，所以和這裏的政界要人大都有深切的友誼。當他發表了離開北京的消息以後，一般故萬莫不爲之惜別，因此他在赴任之前可說是十二分的忙碌，我深怕他沒有空暇可以和我一談。有一天我和那位朋友談及，他就說明王揖唐爲土田公使餞行，也邀他做陪客，他可以替我事先請他定一個會見的日期和時間。不料我第二天正想去問他的好了沒有的時候，忽然他來電話說，王氏的宴會取銷了，因爲土田公使實在抽不出空暇來。因此，我只好拿了我那位老友的介紹片，自己到使館去祥訪他了。但是有一件困難的事，便是因爲我不懂日語，雖然據我的那位老友說，土田公使講得一口極爲流暢的法語。</p>
<p>盟邦駐華大使館北京事務所，就在軍司令部的旁側，那裏因我去看過竹田報道部長好幾次，所以倒是路徑熟悉的。尤其因爲盟邦人士在這裏，無論是軍政方面，都是對我國人十分的禮貌，對於一位不懂日語而要到日本機關去訪問的我，自然便利得多了！</p>
<p>一朶紅花標幟</p>
<p>十一月十五日的下午三時，我就離開了住的六國飯店，坐了三輪到使館。那時已有三點半鐘了，可是受付處的人說，土田公使這幾天很忙，現在還沒有回來。他們因此便給我一朶紅花，這乃是來訪賓客的標識，請我自己到樓上總務部部長室去詢問。但當我走上樓去的時候，那裏　無一人，在門上輕輕地打了二下也沒有人回音，正在進退爲難時，忽然見有一位事務員走來，於是給我視爲救星。我速忙招呼他請他代爲人內詢問，結果因爲總務部長不在，乃由一位呌「正木求」的先生出來接談。我問他土田公使什麼時候回來，他說不知道，但我旣來了這裏，自然便不能輕輕地放過這個機會，於是我請求在此等候，可是正在那時忽見一位中年英俊男子，穿着一身國防服，外罩黑色呢大衣，大踏步走進來在辦公桌前坐下。不問而知，這便是總務部長了。</p>
<p>對面竟不相識</p>
<p>那位總務部長經正木求先生說明之後，遂即走來和我寒喧坐下。我當即請教總務部長貴姓，因爲我但見他相貌堂堂，態度又是中和寗靜，必然是一位而有爲强幹的外交家無疑。正在這個時候，正木先生笑了，原來他就是我想來拜訪土田豐公使。到他調任爲止，公使本兼任着大使館事務所的總務部長。這一來使我十分的慚愧，連忙表示失敬！可是土田公使却十分的謙遜，還問我什麼時候來北京的。於是我表示歉意，來此兩月有餘還沒有去拜訪他。</p>
<p>知道了他就是土田公使之後，我當即發言道：「公使此次榮陞駐滬公使，想來必有新的抱負，不知能請教一二嗎？」他說：「是的，一切將待抵滬後再與各位商談，我定十八日搭機飛南京，預定十九日就可以到上海了！不曉得先生何日南返，以後還希時時接觸爲幸！」我於是轉入正話：「昨天接得敝報陳社長來電，囑代達歡迎之忱，並爲致候！」公使聽悉之下，常即起立致謝。</p>
<p>關切民生前途</p>
<p>慢慢，我們的話題漸入要港。我首先說：「上海現在的物價眞是嚇人，最近從友人及此問報上獲悉，食米一項已漲到每石二萬多塊錢，照此下去民生前途實堪憂慮，不知公使有何新獻？」土田公使馬上回答設：「民生乃是一切施政之本，本人到滬後當與各方愼重研討適當對策，更盼你們隨時協助。」</p>
<p>以後，我遂問到關於經濟統制問題說：「有許多貴國人，於今亦承認我國國情和貴國不同，經濟統制在我國確有再加檢討之必要，不知公使對此作何見解？」土田公使的回答是簡單而扼要的，他設：「是的，我也很希望到滬後與各方商討這個問顆。」記者又問：「公使對於中日合作有何卓見？」他說：「東京常局對此業已下有決策，不久即將有顯著開展。」最後記者便問：「最近汪主席逝世，上海陳市長已陞任代理主席，不知公使對於新的上海市長人選有何意見？」他說：「人的問題，這是不成問題的。注主席雖不幸未得親覩全面和平之完成，但中日雙方對其決策均已有不動念了。」</p>
<p>在重要問話完畢之後，記者更與略作聞散的對談。在這些談話之中，使我知道土田公使乃是東京都人氏，民國十一年始畢業於東于京國大學。迨後即投身於外交界服務，曾先後兩次到過歐洲，在法滯留甚久，所以法語講得流暢非凡。他看上去不過四十六七歲的人，其溫文儒雅的風度中，一望而知是盟邦新進外交家中一位頂有希望的傑出人才。</p>
<p>「在上海再見」</p>
<p>不久，外面已連續有人來和土田公使接洽要公，而且我也早在正木先生那裏聽到他在四點鐘的時候還有重要會議須待出席，於是和他握手告別。在告別的時候，我們大家都說出「在上海再見」的一句話，正木先生並送我至門外，且告訴我說，他是土田公使的秘書，也將隨其赴任，所以我回到上海之後可以和他連絡。因爲他講得一口和中國人一樣的中國話！（寄自北京）</p>

<h3>寄居何需執照</h3>
<p>鄙人携春寄居黃山路親　虎，以誼屬至親，旣不付房租，更無租約，是鄙人與敝戚之間，依法並無租賃關係存在，（查民法第四百二十一條：稱租賃者謂當事人約定一方以物租與他方使用或收益，他方支付租金之契約）。故毋庸諸領房屋轉租執照。乃上月底有　送房屋轉租執照人員順便前來查詢，謂必須補領執照，並謂現在無從補領，須罰一萬元，由後疏通則五千元可以了結云云。當時因敝戚與本人俱不在家，彼亦不得要領而去，想不久必仍來擾</p>
<p>查房屋轉租執照，原爲保障三房客，使不受二房東非分剝削，用意至善。現聞人旣屬寄居性質，絕非租賃，在敝戚自不受房屋轉租條例之東縛，鄙人亦談不到請求該條例保障之必要，更不能使敝戚蒙受無辜損失。乃該處一二不泆人員曲解法令，據爲敲詐之護符，殊違當局立法之旨。（對心赤）</p>

<p>血型與性格之關係</p>
<p>距今五百年前，羅馬敎員臨危時，曾用三個男孩子輸血，但四人皆陷於死亡，一百年前，有用小綿年輸血，結果無一活者，因那時生命液的秘密尙未發明，無法用此賓貴的血。直至第一次歐戰以後，血液的分類方見明瞭，於是否人方知血型分爲四大類，而知輸血及受血人之配含方法，從此輸血才能安全無危。此後經多時之研究，血型與遺傳之關係，亦逐漸明瞭，而血型與性格之關係，在最近方爲吾人所注意。一國民族之優劣强弱，亦直接血型指數之影響，最近更知各種疾病之頻數，亦因血型體質而不同。最堪注意者，血型雖受遺傳之支配，但兄弟姊妹，並不一定同型，父母與子女，亦非一定同型，故我國古法「滴血認親」之說，已不能成立。但吾人現已能　用新發現之種種亞血型，而解決此種法醫上之糾紛。同時吾人亦能解說父子兄弟性格之不同，其關　即在是。蓋人體各有其潛藏之特性，隨血型而分爲四大類，此種潛在趨向，與各人固定血型，皆終身不變。</p>
<p>日本古川氏稱第一類O型人爲意志型，大都意志精神，均極堅强，不爲外物情感所惑，即Wundtm氏所謂黏液質、但此種人作事主觀，不易與人融和，故朋友不多。第二A型爲思維型，大都溫和順，愼重細心，謙讓不　交際，有同情與犧牲精神，即Wundt氏所精神經質。但經種人　默寡言。缺乏決斷力與勇氣，即借錢與人，亦無勇氣素賞，易爲情感所拘。第三類B型爲感覺型，大都活潑天眞，喜談笑而樂天好友，敏感而膽大果斷，即Wundt氏所謂多血質，但此種人意志不堅，遇事頗易動搖，然人衆與之交，故朋友極多。第四類AB型爲矛盾型，大都外表快活磊落，而用心極深，故此種人一時最難捉摸，不易了解，外有B型之氣質，而內具A型之長處及短處，但性情不定，不易奉承。</p>
<p>AB型在各種民族中皆居極少數，在我國十人中不見一人，我國南方A型人多於B型人，北方則B型人多於A型人，O型人則亦南多於北。故吾人檢定各人自己之血型，並非專爲防意外傷害及輸血之用，亦所以明瞭個人固有之潛在性格，能充分發揮其長處，而去其短處，至於學生因性格而選擇學科，從業人員隨性之所近，而選擇職業，於此皆，從業人員隨性所近，而選擇職業，於此皆能得莫大之佃焉。（上海保健會王世偉醫師）</p>

<h3>Chongqing-Guilin Defense Forces Completely Annihilated, Over 13,000 Captured</h3>
<p>Guilin, 20th (Central News Agency) - In the Guilin capture operation, the Chongqing army left over 5,600 bodies and had over 13,000 captured. Subsequent investigations revealed that, in addition to the commander of the 31st Army, who defended Guilin, committing suicide, and the commander of the 131st Division dying in battle, there were many captured officers such as deputy division commanders, brigade commanders, and regimental commanders. Therefore, the Chongqing Guilin defense force has been completely annihilated. The Guilin defense force, under the command of Wei Yunsong, deputy commander of the 16th Group Army, consisted of the 171st Division and elements of the 188th Division of the 31st Army, the 170th Division of the 46th Army, and the 2nd Replacement Regiment of the Guilin Garrison Area, totaling about 20,000 men, and formed a large army. Equipped with heavy artillery and mountain guns, they engaged in defensive work. Although the Chongqing authorities strictly ordered them to defend Guilin to the death, under the overall attack of the Japanese army, by the 10th, these Chongqing troops were defeated. On the morning of that day, the main force led by the commander of the 31st Army, attempting to escape from the city, was also pursued and annihilated by the Japanese army. Lieutenant General He Weizhen, commander of the 31st Army, committed suicide in the mountains southwest of the city on the same day because he was directly responsible for the loss of Guilin and thought it would be impossible to escape punishment from Chongqing. Lieutenant General Guan Weiji, commander of the 131st Division, and Chen Jiyou, chief senior staff officer of the 4th Group Army Commander-in-Chief, were both killed in battle in the city on the 9th. Among the captured were also Major General Chao Wei, deputy commander of the 170th Division of the 46th Army, as well as three colonels, seven lieutenant colonels, eight majors, and other officers. Judging from the number of Chongqing troops who abandoned their bodies and were captured, it is clear that the Chongqing Guilin defense force has been completely annihilated.</p>
<p>North of Yishan, Pursuing the Chongqing Army</p>
<p>A certain Japanese base west of Yishan, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army broke through Jiashan, they divided into several teams and fiercely pursued the Chongqing 15th Division, which was scattered and fleeing, not giving them a chance to reorganize. On the evening of the 16th, near Guanailongtou, about 10 kilometers north of Yishan, they pursued the main force of the enemy's 21st Army, which was attempting to escape from Yishan towards Tianhe (30 kilometers north of Yishan). 20 kilometers southwest of Yishan, north of the Yongding River, they pursued a part of the 93rd Army and the 38th Division. Near Huaiyuan, they pursued the main force of the 27th Division. Fierce annihilation operations are currently being carried out separately.</p>
<p>American Planes Shot Down Over Guilin</p>
<p>Guilin, 20th (Central News Agency) - At about 2:30 PM on the 18th, a total of sixteen American P51 and P40 fighter planes attempted to intrude into the airspace over Guilin from the north and south. Japanese anti-aircraft fire immediately concentrated its attack, shooting down two P40-type planes and repelling them.</p>
<p>Transportation North of Jinchengjiang Ineffective</p>
<p>A certain place on the mainland, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army on the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway suffered continuous fierce attacks from the Japanese army and fled in disarray. Materials from the Guilin-Liuzhou base cluster were also concentrated near Jinchengjiang, attempting to be transported towards Guiyang. Because the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou was too rapid, transportation north of Jinchengjiang could not proceed as planned. After the Japanese army quickly reached Yishan, there were dozens of train cars loaded with soldiers and materials running back and forth in extreme chaos on the railway between Yishan and Guiyang. On the 17th and 18th, seven cars were destroyed by Japanese aircraft. The railway lines at key points near Jinchengjiang were also cut off by the Japanese army. Currently, 100 kilometers of railway line between Yishan and Jinchengjiang has lost its transportation capacity.</p>
<p>American Commander Fears Attack on Guiyang</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, the newly appointed American commander in Chongqing, Wedemeyer, told reporters on the 18th that since taking office, he had met with Chiang Kai-shek several times and had proposed a simple and complete plan for future operations against Japan. He said that he was confident that the difficulties of the anti-Axis alliance could soon be overcome. Japan's future target of attack is to go south from Liuzhou, seeking to establish contact with the Japanese army in Vietnam, or to advance westward from the Liuzhou area and attack Guiyang. In terms of terrain, this is difficult to achieve, but we should still devise sufficient countermeasures within all possible scenarios.</p>
<p>Japanese Army in Guangxi Approaches Huaiyuan</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a United Press correspondent in Chongqing on the 19th, the situation in Guangxi is as follows: The Chongqing Military Headquarters admitted on the night of the 19th that the Japanese army was advancing northwest along the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway, approaching Huaiyuan Town (86 li west of Liuzhou). It also admitted that the Japanese army's left-wing troops occupied Xincheng (64 kilometers southwest of Liuzhou) on the 17th. Meanwhile, the Japanese army advanced westward from Baoqing, and Guizhou Province felt extremely threatened. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities admitted that the Japanese army reached a point 29 kilometers west of Baoqing on the 17th, and it is expected that the target of the Japanese army in that direction must be to capture Zhijiang (a key point in western Hunan Province leading to Guiyang).</p>

<p>(3) The complete attainment of China's independence and freedom must be sought in the liberation of East Asia.</p>

<h3>Friction Between Britain, America, Soviet Union, and Chongqing Becomes Increasingly Overt, Internal Division Within the Anti-Axis Front</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) - Since Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing, the four powers of the anti-Axis alliance, have been increasingly at odds, it is as if they are sharing the same bed but dreaming different dreams. After the recent angry return of American Commander in Chongqing Stilwell and Ambassador Gauss to America, the conflict between America and Chongqing has become almost impossible to conceal. Even the direct political system in Chongqing admits the recent reality of diplomatic friction between Britain, America, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. Upon the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, America lost its composure for a time. In the beginning, Britain was also daily concerned that Germany would cross the Channel and invade the British Isles. At the same time, large amounts of Soviet territory were likely to quickly fall into German hands. At that time, in order to protect themselves, Britain and the Soviet Union quickly invited American President Roosevelt to the front lines of the war. On the surface, America then honorably assumed the role of host of this Eurasian war. Chongqing, already in a state of desperation, took advantage of the opportunity of the Greater East Asia War to enter the White House and sit on the anti-Axis conference table. However, because America was out of sorts, it no longer investigated how much power Chongqing actually had or whether the Chongqing government had any real governing ability, and instead recognized Chongqing as a powerful partner, hoping that Chongqing could contain Japan by fighting on the mainland during the Pacific War. However, disappointed, America has been driven by Chongqing, but America has never given up trying to use pressure to send special envoys to Chongqing to turn the tide. However, the diseases afflicting Chongqing are so serious that they are in fact incurable. Internally, it cannot unite; externally, it cannot resist the war. After the battle of Hunan and Guangxi, America resentfully withdrew Stilwell and Gauss. The reason for this lies in the complex military and political situation. America now has the feeling of a mute swallowing coptis chinensis - unable to express its bitterness. Before Roosevelt ran for his fourth term as president, he had to change his policy, and he dared to be angry but dared not speak out against Chongqing. On the one hand, he used the sympathy of Britain's Churchill, who let loose in the British House of Commons, bitterly denouncing Chongqing, saying that Chongqing had always been opportunistic and had not made any effort in the anti-Axis war. On the contrary, it consumed a lot of anti-Axis military strength and munitions, and the aid from Britain and America was enough to strengthen the opposition between Chongqing and Yan'an. The civil and military officials below Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing felt even more disappointed and did not want to implement democratic politics at all. After bitterly criticizing Chongqing, Churchill seriously proposed the greatness of Tagore and suggested to the anti-Axis countries' conferences that the status of the Tagore government be discussed again. Chongqing, after learning of Britain's criticism, felt extremely serious and tried its best to explain to America, while at the same time expressing concessions to Yan'an again. At the same time, it made a defense to Britain, saying that the Chongqing regime had discussed many times how Britain had abandoned Chongqing. The reason was not to sympathize with America in fighting alone in the Pacific, but to be concerned about China's position after the war. Britain knew that its fate would be affected, and it also understood that its colonies would be difficult to protect in this war. Now that Canada has become Americanized, India has become East Asianized, and Singapore, Hong Kong, and other places have all become problems, Britain's suppression of Chongqing is to seek the preservation of its colonies in the future. Therefore, the future strength of China directly affects the survival of British colonies. The capitalist countries of Britain and America have a consistent view on China. Whether the Soviet Union will not interfere in the Far East is very unlikely. Therefore, Britain and America made a preemptive move to express goodwill to Yan'an to see the Soviet Union's attitude. They also asked Stalin to clearly express his views on the Pacific War. Stalin believed that the time was ripe and could be used to his advantage. First, he asked America to continue the lend-lease treaty for three years. At the same time, the Soviet Union allowed America to make a statement, acknowledging that America had a reasonable position in the Pacific War.</p>

<h3>Germany Completes New Defense Line to Defend Territory, American Troops Occupy Geilenkirchen Fortress</h3>
<p>Western Front, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The second four-week plan for the construction of fortresses on the Western Front has also been completed. When the anti-Axis forces approached the German border in early September this year, Head of State Hitler ordered the establishment of a solid fortress line along the existing front line at that time. A four-week construction plan was drawn up. Seeing that the first phase of the plan was not deep enough, the second four-week plan was implemented. Thanks to the efforts of the people of the whole country, several solid new defense lines were completed behind the original defense line. All gun emplacements and shelters are of the latest type. In short, these new defense lines are more solid than the Atlantic Wall.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: On the fourth day of the Battle of Aachen, the American 9th Army broke through the German army's main defense line north of Aachen and occupied Geilenkirchen, and is now continuing to advance northeast. After the American 3rd Army entered Brohl, the fighting is taking place south of Metz. The American left-wing of the Metz foreign defense line is increasingly pressing on the old German border. There is fierce fighting in the area around Wallendorf and Brimdorph west of the Nied River.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Actively Preparing for Winter Offensive, Fierce Fighting to Seize Hongdu</h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency: The weather on the Eastern Front is gradually turning cold, and the muddy roads have begun to freeze. It is expected that the Soviet army's winter offensive will be launched soon. German aircraft have detected that the Soviet army is making major preparations between the Narew River, East Prussia, and as far as the Kurland region. The fighting between Hong Kong Budapest and Mickolsz is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy is attacking along a broad front with 35 divisions, and the German and Hungarian armies are fighting back hard. The enemy broke through several places east of Hong Kong and south of Mickolsz, and once entered Tula south of Heart, but was soon driven back by our army.</p>
<h3>Belgian Resistance Forces Agree to Disarm</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency) - Houtong News Agency, Reuters: After the anti-Axis commander announced that British and American troops would interfere with the disarmament of Belgian resistance fighters, the resistance personnel have expressed their willingness to hand over their weapons. The commander of the anti-Axis expeditionary force in Belgium issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the leaders of the Belgian resistance have decided to hand over their weapons and have asked the military authorities to prepare to receive them.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>National Testing</h3>
<p>A nation's independence and autonomy must be fought for with blood and sweat. When we read Japan's modern history, we see that since Japan was invaded by American Perry, the oppression, humiliation, and other facts it suffered, and all the unequal treaties it signed, were no different from what other East Asian nations have suffered in the past century. However, the Japanese nation endured humiliation and bore burdens, worked hard and endured hardship, and struggled from the most difficult environment, finally creating an independent and autonomous country, competing with Britain and America on an equal footing, and making the British and Americans respect and admire them. The government and the people were of one mind, and the experience of enduring hardship and the courage to never give up were truly moving.</p>
<p>Now, the Allied nation of Japan is not only satisfied with the independence and autonomy of one country, but is also leading all the nations of East Asia to jointly fight for liberation, hoping to obtain the independence and autonomy of the entire Greater East Asia nation. The desire for liberation is the wish of everyone. Especially in China, Sun Yat-sen's advocacy of Pan-Asianism is essentially the independence, autonomy, and mutual assistance of Greater East Asia, so the Chinese people feel even more happy to fight. On the one hand, the Chinese people see the history of the Japanese nation's successful struggle. At the same time, they recall the past martyrs, their painstaking efforts, and their hard struggle with the British and American aggressors. Now, they have identified their goals, continued the legacy of the martyrs, and are faithfully working hard. This is the most appropriate and convenient time.</p>
<p>A nation has experience. The Japanese nation's experience of blood and sweat has created a glorious history. This is a pioneer for other nations and a mirror for other nations. In the past, the liberation of Japan was a separate test of the Japanese nation. In this test, the excellence of the Japanese nation has been shown to the world. Now, the liberation of East Asia is a test of the entire Greater East Asia nation. In this test, the excellence of the Greater East Asia nation will surely be shown to the world, and the liberation of Greater East Asia will surely succeed by following in the footsteps of the liberation of Japan.</p>
<p>Because it is a great national test, every citizen must be careful, focused, and persevering in the testing ground. First, we must establish national self-confidence. We must maintain our past excellence. We must frankly admit our weaknesses. The strength of the Eastern nation lies in perseverance and endurance, and never giving up. This is the national character of Japan and China. In the testing ground, we must especially promote this. We must be more persevering. We must be more enduring. In the past, we used this strength to maintain the survival of the nation for thousands of years. Now, we will use this strength to create the permanent liberation of the nation. Secondly, our weakness lies in the lack of industrialization. Because the Eastern nations have all lived a stable life of agriculture in the past. Until the last hundred years, because of the results of the European industrial revolution, they were invaded by them. Then, they realized the importance of industrialization and only then did they build an industrialized society. Therefore, historically, our degree of industrialization is relatively backward. However, Japan, with the spirit of "catching up", used the latest methods in less than a hundred years, not only caught up, but also made more rapid progress than Britain and America. Now, in the national testing ground, the Chinese nation should work especially hard. In addition, Japan has experience in resisting the aggression of Britain and America. Japan has been dealing with Britain and America for nearly a hundred years, and is very familiar with the psychology and power of Britain and America. This experience is our compass. We must take big strides in the direction of the compass.</p>
<p>The survival of the country is closely related to the nation, and the survival of the nation is closely related to the citizens themselves. This is something that everyone in Greater East Asia should always remember.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chen's Address: Advancing Along Established Policies</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang announced the three major policies of "Peace, Anti-Communism, and National Reconstruction" in March of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) and returned the capital to Nanjing. From then until October of this year, four years and seven months have passed. Unfortunately, he passed away, and the whole country mourns. Having received the mandate when Chairman Wang left the country for medical treatment, and now being appointed responsibility amidst the grief, I, Gongbo, dare not lightly alter the original intention of following Chairman Wang due to my limited talent and heavy responsibilities. Nor can I shirk my responsibility during this difficult time for the nation. All policies set by Chairman Wang will be the policies that Gongbo will implement. All measures established by Chairman Wang during his lifetime will be the measures that Gongbo will continue now. As I take office, I sincerely express my thoughts and ask the colleagues of the National Government and all the military and civilians of the country to work together.</p>
<p>Always Opposing Imperialism</p>
<p>First, the Kuomintang of China reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) and issued the declaration of the First National Congress. Regarding foreign policy, it primarily advocated the abolition of unequal treaties. The late Father of the Nation, in his will, also urged comrades to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time to show the people of the country. All of these are the consistent and long-held aspirations of the Father of the Nation and the Kuomintang comrades, representing the people of the entire country, to oppose imperialism and seek freedom and equality for China. In March of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), the National Government was established in Guangzhou and advocated independent anti-British sentiment. Up until January 9th of last year, when we joined the Greater East Asia War, all were based on the long-standing aim of opposing imperialism to seek the liberation of China. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, although Britain and the United States have suffered setbacks, they have shown no intention of abolishing their illegal interests in China. Recently, the British Secretary of State even declared in the House of Commons that Britain has no intention of abandoning Hong Kong. This shows that there is absolutely no possibility of liberation for China and all of East Asia unless British and American imperialism is defeated. Last year, the National Government joined the Greater East Asia War to fight for principles, for liberation, and even more for the Father of the Nation's Greater Asianism. No matter how the war progresses or how urgent the situation becomes, the military and civilians of the entire country will not waver. In the future, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia will cooperate further to strive for the final victory. Because opposing imperialism is the long-held aspiration of the National Government and the determination of the people of the entire country, I am determined to move forward courageously, regardless of success or failure.</p>
<p>Achieving the Goal of Peaceful Unification</p>
<p>Second, the purpose of the National Government's return to the capital lies in seeking comprehensive peace between China and Japan, and then seeking peace in all of East Asia. This aspiration has been consistently pursued by Chairman Wang and the National Government without any relaxation to achieve it. It was the case on the day of the return to the capital, it is the case today, and it will be the case in the future. From the beginning, the National Government had no intention of being hostile to Chongqing. The people of Chongqing are also the people of the National Government, and the comrades in Chongqing are also our comrades. We have always believed that peace needs to be realized urgently and that the country should not be divided. This sincere desire is understood by the whole country. Over the years, we first established the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty with Japan, then signed the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and participated in the Greater East Asia Declaration. In the meantime, with Japan's cooperation, we were able to recover the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. All of these are the National Government's sincerity to the outside world, establishing the foundation for good neighborliness, and its credibility to the inside, seeking the reality of unification. In the future, the National Government will adhere to the legacy of Chairman Wang to achieve the great aspirations of the inseparable Party and the country and the urgent need for unification, no matter how difficult the foundation, it must be completed. I hope that the military and civilians of the whole country will work together, share the same position, so that China and Japan return to peace, and the country returns to unification.</p>
<p>Cleansing Officialdom and Advocating Integrity</p>
<p>Third, since the National Government returned to the capital, there have been frequent changes. Initially, it was because the Sino-Japanese Incident had not been completely resolved, and then it was because the Greater East Asia War finally broke out. The government focused on long-term plans and inevitably neglected local officialdom. Reviewing the past, there is nothing to excuse. Those responsible for various aspects, either turned a blind eye out of consideration for the difficult lives of officials, or reduced penalties based on past merits of subordinates. As a result, officialdom became increasingly corrupt, and government affairs were neglected. We must know that peace and national salvation are the natural duties of the people, and there is no merit to speak of. Clear rewards and punishments are the great principles of establishing a nation, and forgetting them is ignorance. Now, people are accustomed to suffering deeply, and Communist disturbances are full of thorns. Adding to that, corruption will destroy the country. From now on, the National Government is determined to cleanse officialdom to live up to Chairman Wang's original intention of promoting clean politics. Anyone who harms the people and endangers the foundation of the country, no matter who they are, should be regarded as traitors and abandoned by all.</p>
<p>Increasing Production and Focusing on People's Needs</p>
<p>Fourth, to complete the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative to focus on production. This year, Chairman Wang gave instructions on increasing production. We must implement these instructions. Even if there are various difficulties in raw materials and power during wartime, we must continue to work hard to continue production, so that both military and civilian needs are given equal importance. We must know that military needs are of primary importance, but civilian needs cannot be ignored. Because if civilian needs are not met, it will inevitably lead to instability in people's lives, and the entire production will come to a standstill. In recent times, both military and civilian needs have been in trouble, and it is not yet possible to achieve victory. Therefore, it is hoped that the military and civilians of the whole country will understand this point, cooperate fully, and take both into consideration.</p>
<p>Establishing Security and Rectifying Politics</p>
<p>Fifth, establishing security is also the legacy of Chairman Wang, but the establishment of security lies in military advancement, especially in the rectification of politics. From now on, military and political affairs should be coordinated. Those responsible for military affairs should rectify discipline and strengthen education. Those responsible for political affairs should advocate integrity and implement construction. It is imperative to ensure local peace and stability, so that the people have a place to return to. From now on, both military and political officials must practice what they preach so that local security can be ensured and the foundation of the country can be consolidated.</p>
<p>All of the above are the policies decided on the 20th and are the guidelines for future implementation. Remembering that in the past, we had definite policies but failed to fully express the enthusiasm for practice, we must now wash away the sluggish style and encourage the pursuit of practicality. Furthermore, the establishment of a nation depends entirely on self-reliance. If the government is not built on the people, the foundation will be difficult to strengthen. It is hoped that colleagues will base themselves on the spirit of independence to seek the independence of the country. Furthermore, with perseverance, we must eliminate the mentality of reliance. Then China can be revived, and East Asia can be protected. This humble sincerity is what I wish to share with the colleagues of the National Government and all the military and civilians of the country.</p>

They boldly carried out their designated attacks, each hitting three enemy large transport ships and sinking them. Another plane also broke into the enemy fleet, but because the Japanese plane responsible for direct cover was engaged in a fierce aerial battle with about 20 enemy P39 fighter planes, the results of the attack could not be confirmed.

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Chatting by the Fireside with Cao Rulin (2)</h3>
<p>-- Wu Gong</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands and the Nishihara Loans</p>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands were signed during Yuan Shikai's presidency. Although called the Twenty-One Demands, they were later revised, and only about fifteen or sixteen articles were recognized. Among them, the most important was the issue of the development and mixed residence in the three northeastern provinces. However, even regarding this issue, only lease rights were recognized, and it was stipulated that their residents must abide by local Chinese laws. According to Mr. Cao, as long as this was the case, mixed residence between the Chinese and Japanese people would not be a problem. For example, there are many overseas Chinese living in foreign countries, especially in Southeast Asia, who hold significant economic power in those regions, but they mostly abide by local laws and do not harm the local population. Furthermore, China needs Japanese assistance in the development of all industries, so this mixed residence issue may even be beneficial to us. He greatly admired Yuan Shikai. When he (Mr. Cao was then the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs) received the foreign minister, Lu Zhengxiang's, report regarding the Japanese demands, they went to see Mr. Yuan that night. Mr. Yuan was already in bed, and Mr. Lu immediately went inside to report, while Mr. Cao waited outside the room. Mr. Lu came out less than ten minutes later, which greatly surprised Mr. Cao. Mr. Lu then reported the situation to Mr. Yuan, saying, "The President didn't even look at the note. He just said that he had anticipated this move from Japan a month ago, and now there are only two options: war or peace. War is absolutely impossible." Furthermore, Japan at that time really had no intention of war, so he told them, "Then go and negotiate with the Japanese ambassador immediately." In fact, after the Twenty-One Demands were signed, they were never implemented because Mr. Yuan later orchestrated American intervention in the eastern provinces, which eventually led to the Washington Naval Conference and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The Nishihara Loans were handled by Mr. Cao when he later served as the Minister of Finance and Minister of Transportation, which was around 1919 or 1920. At that time, the European war had ended, and the Terauchi Cabinet in Japan wanted to assist China's unification and reconstruction. Unfortunately, the Beiyang government was too incompetent. This is what happened: Initially, a loan of five million yuan was needed to reorganize the Bank of Communications. Negotiations had already been conducted with Okura, but they stalled because the conditions were too harsh. At that time, a Japanese businessman named Nishihara came to China and, upon hearing this, resolutely agreed to provide the full amount of the loan because foreign loans were always discounted. This one was full amount, and there were no conditions attached, except for the nomination of Mr. Cao as the president of the Bank of Communications. Therefore, this loan for the Bank of Communications was established. Subsequently, Mr. Cao frequently contacted both parties, hoping to achieve unification and reconstruction in China, but unfortunately, the Beiyang government used the money entirely for government expenses, and the unification effort failed completely. Reconstruction was out of the question. According to Mr. Cao, the Beijing government at the time relied solely on customs surplus and salt taxes for revenue, which amounted to no more than seventy million yuan and twenty million yuan, respectively, totaling less than one hundred million yuan per year. So what was the importance of the Nishihara Loans? It was truly a good example of the initial friendly cooperation between China and Japan. Originally, it was intended that Japan would assist China in unification and then develop the three northeastern provinces that had been seized. All resources would be used for China first, and the surplus would be sold to Japan. Is that not still harmful to China?</p>
<p>Discussing Joining the War Again Amidst the Flames of War</p>
<p>China has already gone through two world wars. In the last world war, it stood on the same side as Japan. Unfortunately, in this world war, the battlefield has spread to the entire East Asia, but China and Japan are on two completely different sides. Although, since the return of the National Government to the capital, they have become allies with Japan, sharing life and death. Mr. Cao discussed this issue. Clearly, there must be many emotions welling up in his heart. He said that at that time, China and Japan had initially agreed to join the war together. Although there were military actions in Qingdao, the relationship between the two countries was extremely friendly. Therefore, when China sent delegates to Europe for the peace conference, Japan originally intended to provide large-scale hospitality to the Chinese delegation. The Beijing authorities also originally intended to appoint Mr. Cao as one of the delegates, but he declined because he was not proficient in European languages. At that time, the chief of the delegation was Mr. Lu Zhengxiang, and others included Gu Weijun and Shi Zhaoji. Wang Zhengting was also hired as an advisor to the delegation because he belonged to the Kuomintang's delegation.</p>
<p>Because Japan and China both belonged to the Allied Powers, when the Chinese delegation passed through Japan, not only was warm hospitality prepared, but the Emperor, who was at the villa, had specifically returned to Tokyo to meet the Chinese delegation. Everything had been arranged, and it was believed that the relationship between China and Japan could establish a basis for improvement. However, when the ship arrived in Japan, the Chinese delegation suddenly changed its mind for some reason. On one hand, they claimed illness, and on the other hand, they refused to go ashore. In the end, they only met the Japanese foreign minister at the time. Especially absurd, the important briefcase they were carrying suddenly disappeared, and all the prepared materials were completely lost, causing chaos in Paris. This was the initial shadow cast on the relationship between China and Japan!</p>
<p>Therefore, China gradually drifted apart from Japan. For the sake of the Qingdao issue, they almost ended up in ruins. In fact, Japan had long signed an agreement with China to return it to China after the war. When the Japanese army occupied it, it also returned the police power to China afterward. After the war, it only hoped for a concession. However, those representatives, in order to show off, insisted on handing over Qingdao to the peace conference, and then having the peace conference return it to China. In the end, President Wilson of the United States, after hearing the weeping of the Chinese representatives, also felt helpless and, citing the fact that China had signed an agreement with Japan first as an excuse, hoped that China would negotiate directly with Japan. Later, Gu Xiaochuan blamed Mr. Cao for this matter, which led to his residence being destroyed by the crowd, the so-called May Fourth Movement. After hearing this, and thinking about the fact that the Chinese diplomatic authorities had insisted on submitting bilateral issues to the League of Nations for resolution before this war, I could understand even more. Although the time was a decade or two apart, the lack of diplomatic strategy remained the same. What a sigh!</p>
<p>Finding a New Path to Open Up the Current Sino-Japanese Situation</p>
<p>Mr. Cao is from Shanghai. When I spoke to him, he spoke fluent Shanghainese, which really stirred up my feelings of home. He is very healthy. We later talked about the future of the country and I felt deeply concerned about the general shallow optimism. He is a politician who has practiced Sino-Japanese cooperation. He deeply hates the fact that those who handled Chinese diplomacy in the past lacked a long-term vision and only considered the immediate situation, which led to the country being in such a state. Although he is currently enjoying his retirement, it is easy to see from the enthusiastic expressions during his conversation with the reporter that he is not a pessimistic person. I asked him, "Can a new path be found to open up the current Sino-Japanese situation?" He said, "The new path is sincerity." How to make both parties have sincerity is indeed an issue that we should pay attention to at this time! When discussing the issue of heartfelt thoughts with the Takeda News Department this morning, I presented a view that in order for both parties to have sincerity, there must first be a new ideology that combines the two major ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Finally, I also asked him about the situation of the Jingxing Coal Mine. According to him, the Jingxing Coal Mine mainly produces bituminous coal, so it is an important mine for military needs. For this reason, and related to military applications, production is constantly being increased. However, he hopes that we understand that it is also necessary to attach equal importance to civilian needs, and that it is hoped that unreasonable controls can be resolutely abandoned! However, the treatment of coal miners is now much better. Each person is given three pounds of flour every day, and family members are given one and a half pounds of flour per day, limited to four people. In addition, there are daily necessities and coal, so although the salary is only several tens of yuan per month, it is much more comfortable than for middle and lower-level civil servants here. It is said that once, the police station in a certain place arrested some workers to work, and everyone was very afraid at the time. But when they returned after a month, each of them had inexplicably received half a bolt of cloth and a bag of flour (forty pounds), and everyone was overjoyed!</p>
<p>I really wouldn't feel tired of such a conversation even if we talked for another two hours, but it was already too late, so I said goodbye in the twilight! (Sent from Beijing)</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Ministry Announces Commendation of Meritorious Units</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese air force unit at a certain base and the new unit under its command, as well as the air force unit at a certain base, have encircled the main force of the enemy mobile units in the waters around the Nansei Islands, Taiwan, and northern Philippines since October 10th and have launched a fierce attack on them. A certain attack unit, in particular, has repeatedly attacked enemy forces in the waters east of Taiwan for three days since the 12th, achieving remarkable results in the great air battle off the coast of Taiwan. Japanese Commander Toyota specifically presented commendation certificates on October 23rd, and it was reported to the Emperor. This matter was announced by the Japanese Naval Ministry on the 19th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Ministry announced on the 19th: Since the beginning of September, the Japanese army and naval forces on Peleliu Island have been engaged in heroic battles for more than two months, bravely fighting to strike enemy naval forces and landing forces, inflicting great damage on them. The commander-in-chief of the combined fleet has separately awarded citations, and it has now been reported to the Emperor.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Fiercely Attack Enemy Forces in Morotai</h3>
<p>Certain Japanese Base on the Front Lines, 20th (Central News Agency) - After being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army, the enemy forces on Leyte Island have recently been stepping up their reinforcements, dispatching air force and supplies from Morotai. The Japanese air force, starting from the morning of the 18th, achieved great results in fighter plane battles. Another team bravely advanced into Leyte Gulf and happened to discover enemy transport ships fully loaded with soldiers and military supplies sailing in the bay. They repeatedly launched fierce dive bombing attacks on two large and two medium-sized ships, and all four enemy ships were hit and caught fire. Another team raided enemy landing craft and repeatedly bombed and destroyed eight of them. They also attacked the enemy's front-line artillery positions near Harold, daringly carrying out dive bombing attacks, burning down two ammunition dumps and artillery positions. All Japanese planes returned safely to their defenses.</p>

<h3>Strictly Enforce Light Control; Revise Penalties for Power Outages; Police Bureau Orders Subordinate Branches to Carefully and Strictly Handle</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau has repeatedly instructed on strengthening light control in the city, and in July of this year, ordered each branch bureau to thoroughly crack down on violations of light control in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Handling Light Control Violations. However, investigations reveal that past results have been quite unsatisfactory. The Army, Navy, and Air Defense Headquarters are deeply concerned about this, and military and police authorities have sent letters to the bureau urging decisive action.</p>
<p>Strictly Crack Down on Light Leakage</p>
<p>Therefore, the Police Defense Department has re-ordered each branch bureau to strictly enforce light control. Light control is the greatest obligation of the people during wartime and has been widely publicized. Even the slightest gleam of light is not allowed to leak. However, even now, there are still instances of light leakage due to inadequate equipment or carelessness. Personnel responsible for control either ignore it or use it as an excuse for extortion. All of these are unforgivable acts. Each branch bureau chief should understand this and instruct subordinates to strictly crack down on such behavior. At the same time, lookout posts should be properly utilized so that light control within their jurisdiction can be thoroughly implemented. Careful verification and strict handling are required to meet the needs of the current situation.</p>
<p>Revised Measures for Sealing Electricity Meters</p>
<p>As for the penalties for those who violate light control, they should be handled in accordance with the stipulated penalty regulations. The method for sealing electricity meters has been revised, and each branch bureau must exercise its delegated authority in accordance with the regulations in order to achieve complete success in light control. The revised method for sealing electricity meters is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Branch bureau chiefs should consider the severity of the violation and the intent of the offender when determining penalties. If the offender has unavoidable circumstances, the branch bureau chief may seal the electricity meter for five days or less, ordering the offender to complete the light control equipment setup within the sealing period. Upon expiration of the period, the equipment should be inspected to ensure it is complete before unsealing.</p>
<p>(2) If the offender has no unavoidable circumstances, the branch bureau chief may seal the electricity meter indefinitely and report the circumstances for review. The authorities will inquire about the details in writing based on the branch bureau chief's report and then decide on a period for power outage punishment. Therefore, the branch bureau chief's report must be carefully and accurately made.</p>
<p>(3) Branch bureau chiefs may adopt a system of joint and several punishment based on the local situation and the condition of residents, taking a 'jia' (a unit of households) or a household as a unit. When implementing this system, the public in the area should be notified in advance that if three violations occur in the area continuously, the power lines of the entire area will be cut off.</p>
<p>(4) If an offender whose electricity meter has been sealed for five days or less by the branch bureau chief fails to complete the equipment setup by the expiration of the sealing period, or if the same family commits a second violation, the branch bureau chief should report the circumstances for review.</p>
<p>(5) The measures decided by the branch bureau chief should be reported every five days, as per practice, regardless of whether there are violations, and in accordance with the matters stipulated in Police Defense Order No. 15. In addition, when applying for the exercise of delegated execution, a factual report should be made each time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister to Shanghai, Tsuchida, Gives Inaugural Address; Semi-Review and Implementation of Policies on Various Central China Issues</h3>
<p>Mr. Usami, the Japanese Minister to Shanghai, has been ordered to transfer to another post, and Mr. Yutaka Tsuchida has been appointed as his successor. Minister Tsuchida took office on the afternoon of the 19th of this month. On the morning of the 20th, he visited various relevant agencies in the city and gave his initial instructions to the staff of the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy in China. Starting at 1:00 PM, he met with the press corps for the first time and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters: I am very pleased to be stationed in Central China for the second time. However, compared to my first time in China, the situation has changed greatly, so the administrative policies are also very different. There are many important issues in Central China that need to be resolved urgently, such as adjusting prices, adjusting coal weight, adjusting trade, how to gather the overall strength of Central China to achieve enhanced power, and assisting in the Greater East Asia War, and how to establish the decisive battle posture of Japanese residents in China. These important issues must be reviewed in detail with reference to the opinions of all parties, and then decisions should be made to seek reasonable solutions.</p>
<p>Further news, Mr. Sazo, Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China, has been transferred to serve in the Greater East Asia Ministry. His vacancy will be filled by Mr. Tsuchida, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping. His vacancy will be filled by Mr. Yoshitaka Hanawa, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Manchuria.</p>
<h3>Press Conference Held Yesterday at Japanese Embassy Office</h3>
<p>The regular press conference of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy was held at the 　 Hotel at 2:30 PM yesterday (the 20th). Mr. Matsudaira of the Information Department was unable to attend due to important business and was represented by Vice-Consul Fukuma. He met with Chinese journalists from this city and spoke in great detail about the recent international situation, lasting for two hours.</p>
<h3>Match Unified Tax Rate Increases Twofold</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance believes that the black market price of matches has soared in recent months, several times higher than the original unified tax valuation. Tax revenue should be increased by adjusting the valuation. However, matches are a daily necessity for the people. While national taxes should certainly be increased, the people's livelihood should also be taken into consideration. Therefore, it is proposed to temporarily add 200% to the current tax rate, while still collecting 10% per 100. It is now scheduled to take effect today (the 21st).</p>
<h3>Agricultural Assistance Association Evaluates Agricultural Products</h3>
<p>The Central Agricultural Assistance Association, affiliated with the Allied Embassy, is holding an agricultural product evaluation meeting at the Hongkou Shanghai Shrine today to understand the harvest situation in various regions this year, to assess the quality of agricultural products, and to encourage farmers to promote increased production. Various agricultural products from various counties are collected and displayed for public viewing to promote increased production. Mr. Tsuchida, the president of the association, Vice President Okazaki, and Mr. Zhao Zhengping, president of Shanghai University, are responsible for the evaluation, and awards will be given for superior products.</p>
<h3>Sailors and Seamen Graduate Regularly</h3>
<p>The Central Sailor Training Institute has been conducting training for naval sailors and merchant seamen since its establishment. To date, there have been eleven classes of sailors and one class of seamen. It is learned that the graduation ceremony for the 15th class of sailors will be held at the end of this month, and the graduation ceremony for the first class of seamen will be held at the end of December.</p>

<h3>A Visit with Minister Tsuchida</h3>
<p>— Wu Gong</p>
<p>When I was coming north as a reporter, an old friend of mine mentioned Mr. Tsuchida, the Counselor of the Allied Embassy in Beijing. It is said that he is a promising new figure in the Japanese diplomatic world and is very close to Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu. After arriving in Beijing, I was too busy with mundane matters and forgot to visit him at the embassy, ​​which was certainly a regret. However, since I read the news in the newspaper here that Counselor Tsuchida had been transferred to become the Allied Minister to Shanghai, I naturally could no longer delay and immediately decided to visit him before he took office.</p>
<p>Deep Parting with Old Friends</p>
<p>Minister Tsuchida only has one single name, called "Yutaka". He has been working at the Allied Embassy in Beijing for six or seven years, so he has a deep friendship with most of the important political figures here. After the news of his departure from Beijing was announced, everyone mourned his departure. Therefore, he was extremely busy before taking office, and I was afraid that he would not have the time to talk to me. One day I talked to that friend about it, and he explained that Wang Yitang was holding a farewell dinner for Minister Tsuchida and also invited him to be an escort, and he could help me arrange a meeting date and time in advance. Unexpectedly, the next day when I was about to ask him if it was all set, he suddenly called and said that Wang's banquet had been canceled because Minister Tsuchida really could not find the time. Therefore, I had no choice but to take the letter of introduction from my old friend and visit him at the embassy myself. But there was one difficulty, which was that I did not understand Japanese, although according to my old friend, Minister Tsuchida spoke very fluent French.</p>
<p>The Beijing Office of the Allied Embassy in China is right next to the Military Headquarters. I have been there several times to see News Director Takeda, so I am familiar with the route. Especially because the Allied personnel here, whether in the military or political aspects, are very polite to our people, it is naturally much more convenient for me, who do not understand Japanese, to visit a Japanese agency!</p>
<p>Marked with a Red Flower</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on November 15th, I left the Six Nations Hotel where I was staying and took a rickshaw to the embassy. It was already 3:30, but the receptionist said that Minister Tsuchida had been very busy these days and had not yet returned. Therefore, they gave me a red flower, which is a symbol for visiting guests, and asked me to go to the General Affairs Department office upstairs to inquire. But when I went upstairs, there was no one there. I knocked on the door twice lightly, but there was no response. Just as I was in a dilemma, I suddenly saw a clerk coming over, so I regarded him as a savior. I quickly greeted him and asked him to help me inquire inside. As a result, because the General Affairs Director was not there, a Mr. "Motoki" came out to talk to me. I asked him when Minister Tsuchida would return. He said he did not know, but since I had come here, I naturally could not let this opportunity pass lightly, so I requested to wait here. But at that moment, I suddenly saw a handsome middle-aged man, wearing a national defense uniform and a black woolen overcoat, walking in with big strides and sitting down at his desk. Without asking, I knew that this was the General Affairs Director.</p>
<p>Not Recognizing Each Other</p>
<p>After the General Affairs Director was introduced by Mr. Motoki, he came over to greet me and sat down. I immediately asked the General Affairs Director his name, because I saw that he had a dignified appearance and a moderate and peaceful attitude. I had no doubt that he was a capable diplomat. At this moment, Mr. Motoki laughed, because he was the Minister Yutaka Tsuchida I wanted to visit. Until his transfer, the Minister concurrently served as the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Embassy Office. This made me very ashamed, and I quickly expressed my apologies! But Minister Tsuchida was very humble and even asked me when I came to Beijing. So I expressed my apology for not visiting him for more than two months since I came here.</p>
<p>After I knew that he was Minister Tsuchida, I immediately said, "Minister, you have been honorably promoted to Minister to Shanghai this time, I think you must have new ambitions. May I ask you about them?" He said, "Yes, I will discuss everything with you after I arrive in Shanghai. I will definitely fly to Nanjing on the 18th, and I am scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 19th! I don't know when you will return south, sir, but I hope to be in touch with you often in the future!" Then I entered the main topic: "Yesterday I received a telegram from President Chen of your newspaper, asking me to convey his welcome and greetings!" Minister Tsuchida immediately stood up to express his gratitude upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Concerned about People's Livelihood and Future</p>
<p>Slowly, our topic gradually entered the main port. I first said: "The current prices in Shanghai are really scary. I have recently learned from friends and newspapers that the price of rice has risen to more than 20,000 yuan per shi. At this rate, the future of the people's livelihood is really worrying. I wonder if the Minister has any new ideas?" Minister Tsuchida immediately replied that: "The people's livelihood is the basis of all administration. After I arrive in Shanghai, I will carefully discuss appropriate countermeasures with all parties, and I hope you will assist me at any time."</p>
<p>Afterwards, I asked about the economic control issue and said: "Many people in your country also admit that my country's national conditions are different from those of your country. It is indeed necessary to review economic control in my country. I wonder what the Minister thinks about this?" Minister Tsuchida's answer was simple and concise. He said: "Yes, I also hope to discuss this issue with all parties after I arrive in Shanghai." The reporter then asked: "What are the Minister's excellent views on Sino-Japanese cooperation?" He said: "The Tokyo Permanent Bureau has already made a decision on this, and there will be significant developments soon." Finally, the reporter asked: "Recently, Chairman Wang passed away, and Mayor Chen of Shanghai has been promoted to acting chairman. I wonder if the Minister has any opinions on the new candidate for Mayor of Shanghai?" He said: "The issue of people is not a problem. Although Chairman Zhu was unfortunate not to see the completion of full peace, the decision of both China and Japan on it has been unwavering."</p>
<p>After the important questions were completed, the reporter engaged in a more relaxed conversation. During these talks, I learned that Minister Tsuchida was from Tokyo and graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1922. Later, he joined the diplomatic service and has been to Europe twice, staying in France for a long time, so he speaks extraordinarily fluent French. He looks no more than 46 or 47 years old, and his gentle and refined demeanor shows at a glance that he is a promising talent among the new diplomats of the Allied countries.</p>
<p>"See You in Shanghai"</p>
<p>Soon, people came in one after another to contact Minister Tsuchida about important business, and I had also heard from Mr. Motoki that he had an important meeting to attend at 4:00 PM, so I shook hands with him and said goodbye. When saying goodbye, we all said the words "See you in Shanghai." Mr. Motoki also sent me to the door and told me that he was Minister Tsuchida's secretary and would also go with him to take office, so I could contact him after I returned to Shanghai, because he speaks Chinese as well as a Chinese person!

<p>On the 16th of this month, this newspaper published anecdotes about Mr. Wang. Yesterday, the reader Mr. Wu Fushui sent a letter to add textual research. The original letter is as follows: Dear Editor, in yesterday's issue of your newspaper, "Anecdotes of Mr. Wang Jingwei, Part 2," in the section "According to...", "The young man who bombed Fenghuang Mountain on the fourth day of the ninth month of the Xinhai year was Zhou Zhizhen, a native of Shunde, Guangdong..." This does not conform to the facts. The young man who bombed Fenghuang Mountain that year was Li 　, courtesy name Yingsheng, from Huiyang, Guangdong. The young man who went to Beijing to visit the prison on the night of December 28th of the Gengxu year was also Mr. Li, not Zhou Zhizhen. Mr. Li is now in Hanmen. The 　 movie 　 star Li Dandan, later changed to a pilot, renamed Li 　qing, is the daughter of Mr. Li. To clarify the history of the Party and the country, I hereby testify. Wu Fushui.</p>

<h3>Why Need a License for Lodging?</h3>
<p>I, a humble person, am lodging with my relative 　 Hu on Huangshan Road this spring. Because of our close relationship, I do not pay rent or have a lease. There is no landlord-tenant relationship between me and my relative. (According to Article 421 of the Civil Code: "A lease is a contract in which one party agrees to rent a thing to the other party for use or profit, and the other party pays rent.") Therefore, there is no need for a house sublease license. However, at the end of last month, a person who delivered house sublease licenses came to inquire, saying that I must apply for a license and that it is now impossible to apply for it and I must pay a fine of 10,000 yuan, but if I bribe them, 5,000 yuan can settle it. At that time, because my relative and I were not at home, they did not get what they wanted and left, but I think they will still come to harass us soon.</p>
<p>House sublease licenses were originally intended to protect subtenants from excessive exploitation by sublandlords, which is a very good intention. Now, it is heard that since I am merely lodging and not renting, my relative is certainly not bound by the house sublease regulations, and I do not need to ask for the protection of those regulations, nor can I allow my relative to suffer innocent losses. However, a few unscrupulous people in that office distort the law and use it as a shield for extortion, which is contrary to the purpose of the authorities' legislation. (To a Loyal Heart)</p>

<h3>First Lecture Held at Unemployment Relief Lecture Series</h3>
<p>The Unemployment Relief Lecture Series organized by this office held its first lecture yesterday at the South Tong Road Zhong Jiao Daoyi Association, and the participants were extremely enthusiastic. First, Dai Jingwan reported on the significance of the event, stating that: "I sympathize with the suffering of the unemployed and have the purpose of helping oneself and others and serving the society, so I have organized the Unemployment Relief Lecture Series. In addition to lectures and guidance on physical and mental cultivation, I also plan to organize job placement and small loan work to reduce the suffering of the unemployed." Then, Mr. Wang 　shan spoke, stating that: "This lecture series can not only influence the gentlemen present to abandon bad habits, but also benefit the society in the future. I will definitely do my best to support it." Then, Mr. Wei Wuchou gave a lecture on the causes of unemployment and relief principles. The second lecture is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 26th of this month, still held at the same association, and will actively carry out relief work, while also giving the unemployed the opportunity to discuss difficult issues, so that they can be raised for discussion at each lecture, or questions can be asked in writing.</p>
<h3>Layman Rong Boyun Donates Fees to Help the Needy</h3>
<p>Mr. Rong Boyun, a feng shui expert, is skilled in the art of Yangzhai, which is subtle and incredible. However, Mr. Rong cherishes himself and is unwilling to easily engage in business. Now, for the sake of relieving the food shortage of monks and nuns in various places, after Master Kuandao's repeated persuasion, he has made a grand vow to open up to requests as an exception and set donation fees, and all the proceeds from the donations will be used for the following purposes: (1) 40% to relieve the food shortage of monks and nuns in famous mountain monasteries in various places; (2) 20% to subsidize the Jingtuzhuanxiu Dojo of Nan Shi Sanmei Pure Land Monastery; (3) 20% to fill the Laoxi Gate Guandi Temple Nanshi Buddhist Clinic and Medicine Distribution; (4) 20% to donate to the six relief projects of this office. Contact address: Sanmei Pure Land Monastery, Xiaonanmen, Nanshi, Shanghai, telephone (02) 70451.</p>
<h3>Po Ai Clinic for Free Medical Treatment and Medicine</h3>
<p>The Po Ai Clinic for Free Medical Treatment and Medicine is organized by Christians. All those who are genuinely poor and sick, with proof from the Baojia head or a shop, will receive free medical treatment and medicine, whether for outpatient or house calls, except for a registration fee of thirty yuan. Outpatient hours: until 12:00 noon. House calls must be booked in the morning. The presiding doctor is Xu Boying. Location: No. 5, Tianfu Lane, Datong Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII) Cixi Road (formerly Rue du Consulat).</p>
<h3>Chinese Moral Improvement Society - Winter Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The Chinese Moral Improvement Society on Zheng Guan Road has consistently undertaken charitable activities such as providing congee, distributing cloth, providing free medical treatment and medicine, providing small loans, and running an orphanage, sparing no effort. As winter approaches and the weather turns cold, the poor are not only suffering from a lack of food but also lack warm clothing to protect themselves. They have no one to turn to for help, which is truly pitiful. Therefore, the Society is expanding its winter relief efforts by providing congee and clothing. It plans to raise 200 shi of rice and 4,000 sets of clothing, requiring over 10 million yuan. Deeply concerned about its limited capacity, the Society appeals to philanthropists from all walks of life for their support to jointly undertake this righteous cause.</p>
<h3>Russian Language Night School Opening</h3>
<p>The Aurora University of this city is assisting in opening a Russian language night school. Ms. Fuming, a teacher from a Russian girls' school, will be in charge of teaching, using the direct teaching method. Classes will be held every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. The course will cover reading, conversation, and grammar. It is expected that students will be able to engage in ordinary conversations after three months. The school address is No. 220, Changle Road, i.e., the old Qingshi Road, St. Michael's School. The school is scheduled to open on December 1st. Beginners are especially welcome. The tuition fee is only 600 yuan per month. Those who are interested in learning can register at St. Michael's School immediately.</p>
<h3>Convenient Remittance to Nantong</h3>
<p>I live in the eastern countryside of Nantong—Yudongtou Jiahai. Previously, due to the needs of my family, postal remittances were not possible, and there was no convenient way to bring money back, which was quite difficult. Later, a friend told me that the He &amp; Co. at Room 314, No. 33, Sichuan Road provides remittance services for customers, which are fast and reliable. After contacting them, Mr. Shui Zhou helped me remit the money. I have now received a letter from my family saying that they have received the money correctly. It only took one week, which is very fast. Given the current transportation difficulties, I am borrowing a corner of your newspaper to inform my fellow villagers who want to remit money.

<p>The Relationship Between Blood Type and Personality</p>
<p>Five hundred years ago, when a Roman teacher was in critical condition, three boys were used for blood transfusions, but all four died. One hundred years ago, sheep's blood was used for transfusions, but none of the recipients survived. This was because the secret of life fluids had not yet been discovered, and this precious blood could not be used. It was not until after the First European War that blood types were clearly classified, and it was then that people realized that blood types are divided into four major categories and understood the compatibility of blood donors and recipients. From then on, blood transfusions became safe and risk-free. After much research, the relationship between blood type and heredity has also become clearer, and the relationship between blood type and personality has only recently come to our attention. The quality, strength, and weakness of a nation are also directly affected by the blood type index. Recently, it has become known that the frequency of various diseases also varies depending on blood type and constitution. Most notably, although blood type is controlled by heredity, siblings do not necessarily have the same blood type, and parents and children do not necessarily have the same blood type. Therefore, the ancient Chinese method of "blood kinship recognition" is no longer valid. However, we are now able to use newly discovered sub-blood types to resolve such forensic disputes. At the same time, we can also explain the differences in personality between father and son, and brothers, which is related to blood type. Each person's body has its own hidden characteristics, which are divided into four major categories according to blood type. These latent tendencies and each person's fixed blood type remain unchanged throughout life.</p>
<p>The Japanese scholar Furukawa believes that people with type O blood are of the willpower type. Most of them have a very strong will and spirit and are not easily swayed by external emotions, which is what Wundt called phlegmatic. However, these people are subjective in their actions and do not easily integrate with others, so they do not have many friends. Type A blood is the thinking type. Most of them are gentle, cautious, careful, humble, good at socializing, and have a spirit of compassion and sacrifice, which is what Wundt called the nervous type. However, these people are taciturn and lack decisiveness and courage. Even when lending money to others, they do not have the courage to ask for repayment and are easily constrained by emotions. Type B blood is the feeling type. Most of them are lively, innocent, cheerful, optimistic, friendly, sensitive, bold, and decisive, which is what Wundt called sanguine. However, these people have a weak will and are easily swayed by events. However, many people like to associate with them, so they have many friends. Type AB blood is the contradictory type. Most of them appear cheerful and open-minded, but they are very deep in their hearts. Therefore, these people are the most difficult to grasp and understand. They have the temperament of type B blood on the outside, but they have the strengths and weaknesses of type A blood on the inside. However, their temperament is unstable and they are not easy to flatter.</p>
<p>Type AB blood is the rarest in all ethnic groups. In China, you won't find one in ten people. In southern China, there are more people with type A blood than type B blood, while in northern China, there are more people with type B blood than type A blood. There are also more people with type O blood in the south than in the north. Therefore, determining your own blood type is not only for preventing accidents and blood transfusions, but also for understanding your inherent potential personality, so that you can fully develop your strengths and eliminate your weaknesses. As for students choosing subjects based on personality and employees choosing occupations based on their aptitudes, all of this can be greatly benefited.

<h3>The China Children's Welfare Association Hopes for Continued Donations</h3>
<p>The China Children's Welfare Association, in order to raise funds for the half-yearly education and upbringing of refugee children, has specially launched a fundraising campaign initiated by prominent social figures such as Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Binhe, and Ding Boxiong.

In just one week, more than one million yuan has been raised, which shows the enthusiasm and love of society for rescuing orphaned children and cultivating vitality for the country, which is admirable. However, the Association's fundraising target is five million yuan, and it still hopes that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to donate to jointly undertake this benevolent cause.</p>
