<p>林宣部長昨晚廣播</p>
<p>甫京十二日中央社電林部長昨為國父逝世紀念繼首都造練運動臨時委員會之請，在中央廣橋電合廣播，題為「怎樣紀念國父」要點如左：造林運動因為遵仃國父培植森林改進農業之遣訓，在目前戰時增產運動中更具有重大之時代者義。大亞洲主義是國父逝世前最後一次的講演，也就是國父到於國民革命由解放中國進而解放東亞的指導方針，為什麽國父死後不但沒曾照着遵行，反而走了一條適得其反的路，雖然幸而於不幸的血變當中打開了一綫光明的絡，然而當前的荊棘怎樣調除，前遂的艱苦怎樣克服，這都是我們今日所當深自警惕其同策勵的。我們要動員所有精神力量物資力量協助盟邦完遂大東亞戰爭，以確立實現大東亞主義之根本，亦即所以奠定革命成功的基礎。以上為我們今日絕念國父逝世應有之認識，只有這樣紀念造林，才有它不可磨減的評價和意義。</p>
<h3>加拉頓河谷攻勢日軍已控制戰局英西非軍主力被包圍</h3>
<p>仰光十二日中央社電日軍各部識對於刻在加拉頓河谷蠢動之英四非第八十一師主力部隊數千人，在加拉頓比河中間地帶，加以猛該部敵軍狼狽向巴勒拕瓦方而退去。但彼日軍分數路將其包圍，故頓地帶有被切斷之勞。據被俘之英第七師司令部隨從大尉供稱，敵方豫定於二月中旬開始攻學阿恰布，使第八十一師與第五第七兩師取得運絡，由加拉頓南下，企圖直攻阿恰布，但日軍首光發動攻勢，猛攻敵第七師，致形勢為之一變。敵即變更預定計劃，急調第八十一肺南下，以牽制日軍之側背，期可挽回　勢，日軍早察知敵之企圖，即誘引敵軍深入一舉將之擊潰。又印度國民軍刻向吉大港進攻，得日軍之協力，刻正對敵軍開始猛擊，故敵軍之奪回阿恰布計劃業歸失敗，現正命令最後之預備部隊第二十六師開往第一綫作戰，企圖挽救敗局，然此不僅不能奪回阿恰布，即防衛國境綫亦瀕瀕於危機矣。現日軍已完全堂握戰局之主　權策應阿恰布加拉頓方面之積極攻勢，而在中部緬印國境琴兵陵地帶開始猛烈之先制攻舉，敵軍現已呈混亂狀態。由南都緬印國境迄中部緬印國境之大决戰，已使敵方為防衛印度而惴惴不安。</p>
<p>革新上海第一課</p>
<p>一國身患病症的人，當然渴望健康。可是，如下役法醫治，祛除病根，則決不可能恢復健　的，這是很綫願的事　，一個人如此，一個社會，一個國家，，也莫不如此。</p>
<p>我們中國猶是一個身患重病的入，國民渴望國家復興，猶如病人渴望身驗健康，絕無二致。可是，如不經過澈底的，整僩的「革新」，也就决不可能實現國家復興。同時，也決不可能貢獻眞實參戰的力量，克盡對英美作戰中應負擔的任務。</p>
<p>「革新」，已經是復與國家，已經是眞實參戰的唯一的先決條件。時機已迫，再不容我們遲徊瞻願，因循坐誤了。然而，以言「革新」，必將從整個着眼，各個入手。於此，我們先談上海的革新間題。</p>
<p>上海市無論在過去與現在，都司以說是全國經濟，文化，敎育的中必，就政治重心而書，除首都以外，也為全國各地冠。自從大東亞戰爭以後，上海更成為後方重要基地之一。所以，從全中國或大東亞範圍以觀，上海居於極重要地位，換言之，上海的一切動態，對於中國各地及大東亞範圍，很有影饗的作用。我們可以斷言，上海如能革新，則可以影響促成全中國革新，可以眞實協同爭取大東亞戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>然而，我們觀察上海目前的病態，誠不能不引為深憂。第一，上海游瓷集中，同時，一向是物資集散的樞紐，游資流竄於物資圈裏，更以社會複雜，謠言特多，人心渙散，遂造成極度惑性的投機囤積，擾亂物價。第二，因為物價波動，上海十之七八的薪水階級，生活艱困形成嚴重的民生不安現象，終日焦慮於生活而不免作非分之想，自私好利的觀念，普通滋蔓，社會道德愈益低落。第三，競事投機，追求暴利以後，正常生產事業，反而不感興趣，一方面工業原料與動力之取給困難，生產愈益減少，物資因之短少，而物價因之愈狂。民生因之愈苦。</p>
<p>革新上海，自當從各方面八手，茲先就政治而言，非常努力，頗足稱道。不過，對於革新的目標，距　尚　，我們認為政治革新的首要條件，就是人事問題。上海市陳市長原兼任中樞要職，目前大東亞戰爭已屆决戰階段，今後中樞政務必須加重責任，隨時與决戰配合。所以，陳市長或　中樞表任更大，下能兼顧·那末，我們姑作假定，則對此擊上海安危的市長人選，實有無限的期待，我們理想中的市長：</p>
<p>能以解央市民生活間題為第一宏願。</p>
<p>能促進恢復並提高生產效率，培養人力物力，實際負獻於大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>能整飭吏治，裁汰冗員，調整公務員待遇，提高工作效率，使政治漸上軌道。</p>
<p>能指導公警人員提高服務志願，養成愛民觀念，使與市民打成一片，協力建設上海市。</p>
<p>能以全副精神盡瘁於市政，專心一職，不兼其他政務。</p>
<p>能以市民福利，政治革新為職志，而不存黨派門戶之見。</p>
<p>有豐富的政治經經騐，有高尚的人格，有廉潔的操守，有磅　的氣魄，有大無要的精神，有積極果敢的勇氣，革新一切。</p>
<p>同時，我們認為　只會做官不會做事的，　　預泄沓，因循苟且的，　只知黨派不知人民的官僚政客，决不是理想的人物，而不能擔負革新上海的重責，挽救上海危機，解除市民痛苦，眞實貢獻參戰力量者，決不配做我們的父母之官。</p>
<p>其次，居於重要地位的市府幹部，也須採取才職相稱的人物，澈底實行專家政治，並從速建立溝通市民意見的民意機關，協同革新上海市政。如何具體實施，我們當再作建議。</p>
<p>我們感於時局之嚴重，非澈底革新，無以社除已深的病根。我們所作主張，無非希望上海的健全，影響及於中國的健全，成為名副其實的後方健全基地，而對復興中國，協力爭取大東亞勝利，更有莫大的裨助！</p>
<p>戰略自相矛盾英美深感苦痛</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電日本頃甸方面派遺軍繼辛澤瓦　滅戰之後，復對頃印邊境中部琴丘陵地帶之敵軍開始奇　作戰，此等運續作戰不僅已粉碎敵方欲奪回緬甸之企圖，並予英美之太平洋共同戰略以一大衝擊，其意義可謂深長。由於蒙特巴頓軍之敗，致美軍首　部間對英軍緬甸反攻作戰之方法與速度，復表示極度不滿，幷加以極苛之批評。其中美軍最大之不滿，即為美國雖正傾其全力努力展開對日攻勢，但英國則保持自國之勢力而不盡力於對日共同戰爭之一點，即如美軍方面曾痛烈非難稱，華雜爾將使駐印英軍之大半從事維持印度領內之治安，致蒙特巴頓不克展開攻勢，但英國對此非難則掩飾反　馭稱，緬甸反攻作戰絕對需要船舶與海軍之　　，但現在之歐洲戰局絕不容有海軍開往亞洲方面，其似僅努力為自己辯獲。關於此點。仍為美國太平洋攻勢諭與英國第一主義論之矛盾論爭，但此論爭去秋已作最後之調整，不料當此太平洋决戰期巳迫目前之日，兩國開太平洋作戰下統一，復形表面化。最近於倫　　行之英美外交会谈中，亦係以比為重要議題，此點又可足證此事實之緊急。總之，美國仍係警戒歐洲戰後英蘇兩國向歐洲伸張勢力及太平洋作戰之孤立化，故乃欲強與自己正面之敵之決戰與歐洲戰爭同時併行，但英國則欲對徳作戰，故英美兩國因各人利得而告對立。</p>
<p>戈思默與越督懇談</p>
<p>西貢十二日中央社電法新任駐日大使戈思默，於赴任途次，十一日正午許道經西貢，曾會見越　德古，以對日關係諸問題為中心舉行懇談。</p>
<p>波根維爾日軍攻佔敵機場</p>
<p>東京十二日中央社電南太平洋日軍某基地十二日電：玻根維爾島特勒基諾方面日軍。十日佔領數處高地後，猛攻敵飛機塲，使其不能使用。又敵軍與後方之通絡亦被切斷，該方面敵軍刻已如風前殘燭，條條所謂沿島作戰已遭受大挫。</p>
<h3>波根維爾日軍攻佔敵機塲</h3>
<p>沮里克十二日中央社電西烏克蘭戰綫，蘇軍於泥　途中，展開攻勢，並以特殊機機部　向徳軍陣地續行猛攻，全戰綫自魯夫庫至聶伯河蔓延四面哩，目前戰局盆呈緊張。父巨哥夫帥欲以此攻勢，獲得決定性之戰果，故彼對此甚為重視。同時孟斯理將軍　下之德軍，亦乘蘇軍攻入卡孟內資（Kamenets）波陀爾斯克（Podolsk）方面之際，將由西方及東南方兩面開始猛攻，由波蘭羅馬尼亞方面增援之靠邊國亦續行開至前綫。又據稱有力蘇軍砲兵部隊已開始砲擊貝尼查外廓之徳軍陣地。</p>
<p>利克十二日中央社電據東綫前綫消息：於　伯河　契爾咯　西南作戰中之河內夫元帥所部烏克蘭戰綫蘇軍，與泰諾波爾方面巨哥夫軍及克里伏洛格方面之馬里諾夫斯基軍之攻勢相呼應，開始大攻勢，于猶曼至基洛伏格勒西北長約百哩之戰綫上，與徳軍對峙中。北由泰諾波爾起至南方黑海之尼哥拉埃夫港之在格河前而約四百哩之全綫，巳成為　蘇兩軍之大决戰塲。又據稱，巨哥夫軍左翼由斯達羅康斯坦了諾夫起，沿鐵路綫向波羅斯科洛夫市南下，目前己於該市北方十三哩之庫拉希羅夫車站附近激戰中。徳軍則用電氣機槍及其他新銳武器猛烈反攻。</p>
<p>東綫德軍使用電氣機關槍</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社電據徳軍當局宣稱：東綫南部之徳軍，已使用電氣機關槍，獲極大效果。</p>
<p>倫敦大空襲從軍記</p>
<p>德空軍自一月廿二日起開始猛炸倫敦，規　之大逮過於一九四一年的倫敦大空製，前後共入次，授下炸彈計六千順，倫敦居民大起恐慌。德報道班員哈　特。楊森君曾參加該空襲　，發表題為「倫敦大空　從　記」的報吿如次：</p>
<p>黑夜前進</p>
<p>在伸手不見五指的黑夜天空中，被聶炸機編成戰鬥隊形，熄滅了燈，　今　空飛行，下邊黑暗的海面上，紅總色的浮標，　約司認。把舵朝　西方，且標是敵首都倫敎，英法海峽的上空，平安過去，奄無變動。不久，飛近英本土海岸，猛烈的高射砲彈的炸裂；照耀如　電不能睜目的探照燈光芒；以及用方向探知器測知我機隊所在而前來迎擊的英戰鬥機羣。—無聲的戰鬥開始了。然而這祗是在飛行員們看來是無聲的戰鬥而巳，因為喧擾的發動襪聲音；蓋過了其他一切聲曾的緣故。我們　先安然突破了敵人的第一道防衛綫。已經是倫敦的上空了。這下面是敵人的首都。</p>
<p>這一夜的倫敦，興以前完全不同。防空砲火的熾烈，實非以前的空襲倫敦時可比。無數探照燈的光芒照着我們。但我們一起來的轟炸機乘員們，都是血氣方剛的靑年，並且他們都是已經有了七次聶炸倫敎的經驗，所以地面上的砲火雖然猛烈，亦若無其事，注視前方，向預定目標突進。</p>
<p>倫敦大火</p>
<p>我們的轟炸機隊，與命令的時問不差一分，到達轟炸目標的上空。命令一下，把所數的高性能大型炸彈紛紛撒下，祇見倫敎市各地火燄冲天，變成一片火海，我機所投下的炸彈，有幾個似乎命中了油稽，捲起千五百米高的火柱，灼紅了黑夜的天空。「倫敦大火」，「燒煎的倫敦活地歟」，我們一面在咒詛着，一面在火塲的上空亂舞。</p>
<p>與火綱交戰</p>
<p>我們所乘的重轟炸機，飛過起火的西市梢，繼　原來的攻擊目標船　　去突然間一道閃亮的光錢照入機內。失敗了，被探照燈照着了。從左面右面，明亮的探照燈光芒緊追蓋，我機眞如在白畫中一樣，無從遁形。高射砲彈在前後左右炸裂，變成茶色的黑，流在後方。現在是駕駛員的技衛與　氣把握着與地上砲火曾戰之鍵，不久，我們仍依原定時間回轉德國母港。平安返醫基地。向司令部報告的勇士的表情，亦極明朗愉快。不久，友軍機亦陸續　來，轟然的引擊聲，與歡笑聲雜然並起。（　：　自三月二日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<p>迭遭空襲羅馬斷水</p>
<p>羅馬十二日中央社電敵機對羅馬實施第二十二及二十三次空襲後，羅馬市內十一日竟告斷永，所有四大抽水站中，三處為炸彈擊中，自來水尚未斷絕之龍頭旁，取水昆衆排列甚長。</p>
<p>義南戰况</p>
<p>柏林十二日中央社电今午德军戰報稱：義境敵斥堠又趨活躍，齊斯　那以南及西南·卡西諾之北，敵以重砲掩護進攻未　，我機炸安齊奧港，重創一千噸運輸船一艘。</p>

<p>市黨部發吿民衆書</p>
<p>中國國民黨上海特別市執行委員為紀念國父逝世十九週年起見，除於昨日晨十時，在該會聯合中國靑年模範團第四聯隊，東亞聯盟中國總會上海分會等全體工作同志，舉仃隆重紀念儀式。由劉主任委員山仰躬親主持，午後並派員分赴各公共塲所散發告民衆書，茲錄其原文如下：</p>
<p>淬勵警惕完成遺志</p>
<p>在民國十四年的今日，是國父在北京逝世的日子，迄今算來，已整整十九年了。在這遙長的時期裏，我們回溯過去，對國父遺志，完成些甚麼呢？應常益加淬勵警惕，來完成國父的遺志。</p>
<p>在耙念逝世十九週年的今日，恰當大東亞戰爭决戰的時期，於此我們深深感到國父之偉大，高瞻遠囑，早巳料到有這一時期的來臨，所以諄諄以「亞細亞者，為亞洲人之亞細亞也」為訓，又把東　王道文化，和西方霸道文化，作剴切的詳述，設：「講王道是主張仁義道德，是由正義公理來感化人，講覇道是用洋槍大砲來迫人……」現在的歐美，正在用他們的覇道，飛揚跋扈地，來危害我們亞洲的時候，單講我們中國，自從鴉片戰爭以來，所受的壓迫和荼毒，　是罄竹難書，妻現在已將近百年了，就是友邦日本在明治以前，也和中國一樣，但是維新以後，發奮圖强，廢除了不平等條約，所以國父把日本明治維新這個時候，看作全亞洲復興的起點，到後來日本一舉戰勝俄國，亞洲民族因此大受震動，自此二十年中，埃及·土耳其·阿當汗·和阿刺伯，相繼獨立成功，而全亞洲民族，團結起來。</p>
<p>爭取東亞最後勝利</p>
<p>國父所希望的時期，竟到臨了，而且已到最後的緊要關頭，我們應該怎樣完成這得大的使命呢？所堪欣幸的，國父所念念不忘的　除不平等條約，巳得到以平等待我的盟邦日木之援助，於去年把租界交還。廢除治外法權，所有一切不平等條約，統歸消滅，這可以勵國父在天之靈的，以後我們應更加努力，運奉遺敎，與友邦協力，以爭取大東亞戰爭之最後勝利。</p>
<p>大柬亞戰爭是歐美霸道與亞洲王道之衝突，所以我國參戰，不是以暴助暴，這理由國父設得最明白：「對於歐洲人只用仁義去惑化他們，要請在亞洲的歐洲人，和平的退回我們的權利，那就像與虎謀皮，一定是做不到的，我們完全收回我們的權利，便要訴諸武力」。所以這次的戰爭，是用武力以收回我們的櫂利，並不是侵略人家。國父又說：「霸道是要服從王道的」，所以我們全亞洲民族十萬人，一致起來，與霸道的英美决鬥，一定使他們屈服的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭現在已屆决戰階段，盟邦日本，擔負起前方的責任，那後方的責任，我們是義不容辭的。然而渝方盲目抗戰，拖延至今，早把僅有的物質與方在萌芽的工業，摧毀殆盡，我們現在要重新建設起來，那是非加倍刻苦耐勞，努力精進不可，而且經濟是總力戰中重要之一環，所以在後方最感迫切的工作，就是增加生產，由此要求農·工·商·產業各界，和本黨同志們，一敎起來，擔負這重大使命，以完遂後方的責任。</p>
<p>希望民衆一致奮起</p>
<p>市慶政府之抗戰，是以暴助暴，幾年來我們所遭受抗戰的痛苦，　是指不勝數，這種禍國殃民的舉措，非僅違反國父遺敎，是國父叛徒，更是亞洲全民族之叛逆。追憶國父在民十三年入北京時，北京政府曾派代表二人來歡迎，那時恰値段祺瑞送尊重列年條約的公文給各國公使，這事被國父知道了，便聲色俱厲的對兩個代表設：「我在外面要廢除不平等條約，你們在北京偏偏的要尊重那些不平等條約，這是為些什麼呢？你們應想升官發財，怕那些外國人，要尊重他們，那麽還來歡迎我什麼呢？」試想現在的重慶政府，豈不是和那時的北京政府如出一轍，他們要想靠歐美人爭取獨立自主，無異與虎諜皮。試再環願一下現實，其是非得失，可以不言而喻了。我們既然敬仰國父，希望全國民衆們，自今天始，一致奮起，并促醒重慶政府，幡然憬悟，共同向國父所指示的光明大路邁進，以期保衛東亞，復興中華之完成。</p>
<h3>新閘路一帶發現天花</h3>
<p>自西區發現天花症以後，最近一區新閘路一帶若干住家，亦發現天花。茲悉該項現象，業已引起衛生留局注意，除分令一部份衛生分辦事處增加種痘時間外，並派遺流動車，沿路實弛檢查種痘證，對未備該證者，即對之施」行强迫種痘。同時工業處以新閘路及其附近各馬路，為工廠林立地帶，天花流行，頗有危及工廠衛生之虞，故决於本星期起，對區內各工廠工作，國體種痘云。</p>
<p>腦膜炎症預防注射</p>
<p>近來本市腦膜炎流行，愈形活躍，衛生當局已擬定應付措置，除飭居民注意淸潔外，更指定衛生分處注射預防疫苗，　上海市居民超過四百萬，故僅由衛生當局實施注射，甚難普遍，故各工商機關，在可能範關內，最好能對所屬職員家屬，實旅預防注射。</p>
<h3>米統會整頓內部人事</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會自召開第一次聯席會議後，對內部人事之健全，業有整頓之計劃，最近並將內部人事，加以整頓，據悉將有籌備委員十五人提出辭職。米統會方面，對本年收買計劃，將採用重質不重量之方針，換言之，即本年甲乙兩地區之收買商人　，將由三百餘名，減至百名左右也。</p>

<h3>蔬菜出售須遵照限價</h3>
<p>晚近以來，各項蔬菜運滬仍絡　於途，矧際斯春節期內，蔬菜茁長，尤為迅速，今除中央市塲陸續採運來此外，並四郊鄉農，均亦肩負來滬，在各小菜塲設攤出售，因此蔬菜供應殊為衆多，但市價反節節高翔。聞關係當局，央將從嚴制止漲風，凡嗣後任何蔬菜出售，其市價必須遵照市塲上掛牌，不得陽奉陰遠，免得處罰</p>

<h3>聯誼苦戰敗於僑聯</h3>
<p>三比五行動越軌滬聯足球甲組精彩賽，聯誼戰僑聯，昨晨十時半在逸園交綏，萬人空巷，擁擠不堪，球迷滿坑滿谷，足見號召力浩大。昨　戰程因過份緊張，以致有少數球員，舉動失軌，幾釀成不歡而散之局面，幸主辦當局竭力調解，戰局草草終塲，亦美中不足。聯誼因後力不濟，以三對五敗於僑聯，從此聯驗對錦標已告渺望。上半時各平手。裁判何春暉。</p>
<p>各一平手</p>
<p>聯誼開球，僑聯順風，聯誼全軍挺進，僑聯麥契蒂不慎手觸球，判十二碼球，許文奎操刀，球在右角命中，僑聯頭關告陷，越五分鐘僑聯大舉反攻，聲熱　赫，鄭英權力救，險演倒戈趣劇。卅分鐘際，僑聯卡派維中央突破，拉脚猛轟，劉顯漢球得而復朱，構成一對一並局峙面，上半時暫告一段落。</p>

<h3>金融工商市况上週轉趨穩定囤戶粉粉貶價出籠</h3>
<p>本市金融與工商各業市况，上週間已由動盪中而轉穩定。因過去兩月來大事囤貨，物價暴漲，引起社會民生不安，多數資金均累積在國貨上面，於是政府為抑平物價安定民生，突以嚴峻措置，除一面由澈查囤積更進一步取締外，一面則由中儲銀行緊縮同業拆放，即凡申請拆放行莊用於囤積主要商品或轉做主要商品押貨者，嚴予拒絕。同時限制同業以自身資金承做主要商品抵押放款，中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處並已開始實施檢查金融機關放款業務，如有利用資金承做主要商品抵押放款而有慫恿囤積之嫌者，即當報請當局，嚴厲處置。</p>
<p>故在上週一起有數家行莊即因囤貨不能出籠，資金頓感週轉不靈，發生擱淺之勢。幸經銀錢同業設法協助，將囤貨貶價變賣抵償，始渡此難關，中儲銀行仍繼續維持同業正當業務之拆放後，金融機關搖風始告平戢，銀根亦漸鬆動，其一般囤積商恐當局查悉，沒收懲處，遂紛紛貶價出龍，物價即不斷下降，故在上週內股票繼往下跌，米煤及一切日用必需品俱見跌落二成以上，當局如能繼續覆行限制押貨，澈查囤積，則物價勢將續有下跌之勢。</p>
<h3>商業各行今照常營業</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業同業公會會負各行莊，俠照公會休假日期我規定，國父逝世紀念並不休假，所以今日（星期一）各行莊均照常營菜，惟國家銀行則不在此例。</p>
<h3>本市各織綢廠謀增加生產</h3>
<p>本市各布莊停止棉布發售巳將半年，市年如欲添置衣着，頗為困難。記者頃自絲綢業方面探悉，由於棉布之無法購得，市上綢緞之需求量大見增加，而各剿絲廠及織鋼廠現正力謀增加生產。按本市織綢廠在事變以後一度頓為不振，規在各停頓工廠已紛紛復工，同時因收　成績之良好，故原料亦能不斷獲得，唯目前受到電力限制，故生產量尚未達到最高舉。又悉木市綢緞存底頗為充足，而各廠復絡繹出貨，故大盤在逐漸下游中，但零售商號門售價格，並無低落云。</p>

<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death and National Tree Planting Day. In addition to the central authorities holding a memorial service at Dr. Sun's tomb, the Capital Afforestation Movement Temporary Committee held a tree planting ceremony in front of Linggu Temple.

<p>Su Province Party Headquarters Reorganized; Chen Qun Concurrently Serves as Chairman</p>

<p>Minister Lin Xuan Broadcasts Last Night</p>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - At the request of the Capital Afforestation Movement Temporary Committee, Minister Lin broadcasted on the Central Broadcasting Station last night, titled "How to Commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen." The main points were as follows: The afforestation movement is in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to cultivate forests and improve agriculture, and it has a significant contemporary meaning in the current wartime production increase movement. Pan-Asianism was Dr. Sun Yat-sen's last speech before his death, and it was the guiding principle for the National Revolution to progress from liberating China to liberating East Asia. Why was it not followed after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, but instead took the opposite path? Although a glimmer of hope has been opened in the unfortunate blood change, how to remove the current thorns and how to overcome the difficulties ahead are all things that we should deeply reflect on and encourage ourselves to do today. We must mobilize all our spiritual and material strength to assist our allies in completing the Greater East Asia War to establish the fundamental realization of Greater East Asianism, which is to lay the foundation for the success of the revolution. The above is the understanding we should have when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death today. Only by commemorating afforestation in this way can it have its indelible value and significance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Control the Situation in the Kaladan River Valley Offensive; Main Force of British and West African Troops Surrounded</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The various units of the Japanese army are fiercely attacking several thousand main force troops of the British 81st West African Division, which are currently active in the Kaladan River valley, in the area between the Kaladan and Bilin Rivers. The enemy troops are retreating in disarray towards Paletwa. However, they are being surrounded by the Japanese army from several directions, so the area is in danger of being cut off. According to a captured captain from the British 7th Division headquarters, the enemy planned to launch an attack on Akyab in mid-February, linking the 81st Division with the 5th and 7th Divisions, and then advancing south from Kaladan in an attempt to directly attack Akyab. However, the Japanese army launched an offensive first, fiercely attacking the enemy's 7th Division, which changed the situation. The enemy immediately changed its plan, urgently redeploying the 81st Division south to contain the Japanese army's flanks, hoping to reverse the situation. The Japanese army had already detected the enemy's plan and lured the enemy troops in for a decisive defeat. Furthermore, the Indian National Army is currently advancing towards Chittagong and, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, is launching a fierce attack on the enemy. Therefore, the enemy's plan to retake Akyab has failed. The enemy is now ordering its last reserve unit, the 26th Division, to move to the front line to try to salvage the situation. However, this will not only fail to retake Akyab but also put the defense of the border line in danger. The Japanese army has now completely seized the initiative and is actively launching offensives in the Akyab and Kaladan areas, while launching fierce preemptive strikes in the Qin Hills area of the central Burma-India border. The enemy army is now in a state of chaos. The great decisive battle from the southern to the central Burma-India border has made the enemy uneasy about defending India.</p>
<p>The First Lesson in Reforming Shanghai</p>
<p>A person suffering from an illness, of course, desires health. However, if an inferior doctor treats the illness without removing the root cause, it will be impossible to restore health. This is a very obvious thing. The same is true for a person, a society, and a country.</p>
<p>Our China is like a person suffering from a serious illness. The people desire national revival, just as a patient desires physical health, without any difference. However, without thorough and complete "reform," it will be impossible to realize national revival. At the same time, it will be impossible to contribute real strength to the war effort and fulfill the responsibilities we should bear in the war against Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>"Reform" is already the only prerequisite for national revival and for genuine participation in the war. The time is pressing, and we can no longer hesitate, procrastinate, or delay. However, in speaking of "reform," we must consider the whole and start with the parts. Here, let us first discuss the issue of reforming Shanghai.</p>
<p>Whether in the past or present, Shanghai can be said to be the center of the country's economy, culture, and education. In terms of political center, it is second only to the capital. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become one of the most important rear bases. Therefore, from the perspective of all of China or the Greater East Asia sphere, Shanghai occupies an extremely important position. In other words, all of Shanghai's actions have a great impact on all parts of China and the Greater East Asia sphere. We can assert that if Shanghai can reform, it can influence and promote the reform of all of China and can genuinely cooperate to win the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>However, observing Shanghai's current state of illness, we cannot help but feel deeply concerned. First, Shanghai's idle capital is concentrated, and at the same time, it has always been a hub for the distribution of goods. Idle capital flows into the commodity circle, and with the complexity of society, the abundance of rumors, and the disunity of the people, it has created extremely deceptive speculation and hoarding, disrupting prices. Second, because of price fluctuations, the livelihood of 70 to 80 percent of Shanghai's salaried class is difficult, forming a serious phenomenon of popular anxiety. They are worried about their livelihood all day long and cannot help but have unreasonable thoughts. The concept of selfishness and profit-seeking is spreading, and social morality is declining. Third, after competing for speculation and pursuing exorbitant profits, people are no longer interested in normal production. On the one hand, the supply of industrial raw materials and power is difficult, production is decreasing, goods are in short supply, and prices are rising wildly. The people's livelihood is becoming more and more difficult.</p>
<p>Reforming Shanghai should start from all aspects. In terms of politics, a great deal of effort has been made, which is commendable. However, the distance to the goal of reform is still far. We believe that the primary condition for political reform is the personnel issue. Mayor Chen of Shanghai originally held an important central position. Currently, the Greater East Asia War has reached the decisive stage, and the central government must increase its responsibilities and cooperate with the decisive battle at any time. Therefore, Mayor Chen may take on greater responsibilities in the central government and be unable to take care of both. Then, let us make a hypothesis. There are infinite expectations for the mayoral candidate who controls Shanghai's safety. Our ideal mayor:</p>
<p>Can make solving the livelihood problems of Shanghai citizens the first great wish.</p>
<p>Can promote the restoration and improvement of production efficiency, cultivate human and material resources, and practically contribute to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Can rectify officialdom, eliminate redundant personnel, adjust civil servant salaries, improve work efficiency, and gradually put politics on track.</p>
<p>Can guide police officers to improve their service aspirations, cultivate a love for the people, and work with citizens to build Shanghai.</p>
<p>Can devote all his energy to municipal administration, focus on one position, and not hold other political positions concurrently.</p>
<p>Can take the welfare of citizens and political reform as his mission and not hold partisan views.</p>
<p>Has rich political experience, has a noble personality, has integrity, has grandeur, has a spirit of selflessness, and has the courage to be positive and decisive to reform everything.</p>
<p>At the same time, we believe that those who only know how to be officials but do not know how to do things, those who are procrastinating and perfunctory, and those bureaucratic politicians who only know the party and not the people are not ideal figures and cannot shoulder the heavy responsibility of reforming Shanghai, saving Shanghai's crisis, relieving the suffering of citizens, and truly contributing to the war effort. They are not worthy of being our "parents" and officials.</p>
<p>Secondly, the key municipal government cadres in important positions must also adopt personnel who are commensurate with their talents and positions, thoroughly implement expert politics, and quickly establish a public opinion institution to communicate the opinions of citizens and jointly reform Shanghai's municipal administration. How to implement this specifically, we will make further suggestions.</p>
<p>We feel the seriousness of the current situation. Without thorough reform, it will be impossible to eliminate the deep-rooted illness. All our claims are nothing more than hoping for the health of Shanghai, which will affect the health of China, become a truly healthy rear base, and be of great help to the revival of China and the joint victory in the Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Strategic Self-Contradiction; Britain and the United States Deeply Feel the Pain</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Following the destruction of the Sinzewa campaign, the Japanese dispatch army in the Indian region launched a surprise operation against the enemy troops in the Qin Hills area of the central Indian border. These continuous operations have not only crushed the enemy's attempt to retake Burma, but also given a major blow to the joint Pacific strategy of Britain and the United States. Its significance can be said to be profound. Due to the defeat of Mountbatten's army, the US military's senior leaders have expressed extreme dissatisfaction and harsh criticism of the British army's method and speed of counterattacking Burma. The biggest dissatisfaction of the US military is that while the United States is making every effort to launch an offensive against Japan, Britain is maintaining its own strength and not doing its best in the joint war against Japan. For example, the US military has severely criticized that General Wavell has used most of the British troops stationed in India to maintain security within India, so Mountbatten cannot launch an offensive. However, Britain has tried to cover up this criticism, claiming that the counterattack operation in Burma absolutely requires ships and naval support, but the current European war situation does not allow naval forces to go to Asia. It seems that it is only trying to defend itself. Regarding this point, it is still the contradictory argument between the US Pacific offensive theory and the British firstism theory. However, this argument was finally adjusted last autumn. Unexpectedly, when the decisive battle in the Pacific is imminent, the unified operation between the two countries in the Pacific has reappeared. Recently, this was also an important issue at the Anglo-American diplomatic talks held in London. This can also prove the urgency of this fact. In short, the United States is still wary of Britain and the Soviet Union expanding their influence in Europe after the war in Europe and the isolation of the Pacific operation. Therefore, it wants to strongly carry out the decisive battle with its direct enemy at the same time as the European war, but Britain wants to fight against Germany. Therefore, Britain and the United States are opposed to each other because of their respective interests.</p>

<h3>Japanese Forces Occupy Enemy Airfield in Bougainville</h3>
<p>Zürich, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - On the Western Ukrainian front, the Soviet army launched an offensive in the mud, and special motorized units continued to attack the German positions. The entire front stretches four hundred miles from Lviv to the Dnieper River. The current battle situation is tense. Marshal Yegorov wants to achieve a decisive victory with this offensive, so he attaches great importance to it. At the same time, the German troops under General von Manstein are taking advantage of the Soviet army's attack on the Kamenets-Podolsk area to launch a fierce attack from the west and southeast. Auxiliary countries reinforced from Poland and Romania are also continuing to arrive on the front lines. It is also said that powerful Soviet artillery units have begun shelling the German positions on the outskirts of Vinnytsia.</p>

<p>A Soldier's Account of the Great London Air Raid</p>
<p>The German Air Force began to bomb London fiercely from January 22nd. The scale of the bombing far exceeded the Great London Air Raid of 1941, totaling eight times and dropping 6,000 tons of bombs. The residents of London were greatly panicked. German correspondent Hart, Mr. Jansen, participated in the air raid and published a report entitled "A Soldier's Account of the Great London Air Raid" as follows:</p>
<p>Advancing in the Dark Night</p>
<p>In the dark night sky where nothing can be seen, bombers formed a battle formation, turned off their lights, and flew empty. Below, on the dark sea, red buoys could be vaguely recognized. Steering towards the west, the buoys were the enemy capital, London. The English Channel was passed safely and uneventfully. Soon, we approached the coast of the British mainland. Fierce anti-aircraft artillery shells exploded; searchlight beams shone like lightning, blinding the eyes; and British fighter squadrons came to intercept us, using direction finders to detect our squadron's location. —A silent battle began. However, this was only a silent battle in the eyes of the pilots, because the noisy engine sounds drowned out all other sounds. We safely broke through the enemy's first line of defense. We were already over London. Below was the enemy capital.</p>
<p>London that night was completely different from before. The intensity of the anti-aircraft fire was far greater than during previous air raids on London. Countless searchlight beams shone on us. But all the bomber crew members who came together were young men full of vigor, and they all had experience bombing London seven times, so they ignored the fierce ground fire, stared ahead, and advanced towards their intended target.</p>
<p>London Ablaze</p>
<p>Our bomber squadron arrived over the bombing target on time, within one minute of the order. An order was given, and all the high-performance large bombs were dropped one after another. We saw flames soaring into the sky everywhere in London, turning into a sea of fire. Some of the bombs dropped by my plane seemed to hit oil depots, causing pillars of fire 1,500 meters high, scorching the black night sky red. "London Ablaze," "Burning London Hell," we cursed as we danced in the sky above the burning field.</p>
<p>Engaging with the Fire Net</p>
<p>The heavy bomber we were on flew over the firing West City, continuing to its original target, a ship. Suddenly, a bright flash of money shone into the plane. Failure, we were hit by a searchlight. Bright searchlight beams chased us closely from the left and right. My plane was like being in the daytime, unable to hide. Anti-aircraft shells exploded in front, behind, left, and right, turning into a brown black, flowing behind. Now, the driver's skills and courage hold the key to engaging with the ground fire. Soon, we still returned to our German home port at the original scheduled time. We returned safely to the base. The expression of the warrior who reported to the headquarters was also very bright and happy. Soon, friendly planes also arrived one after another. The roar of the engine and the laughter rose together. (Note: From the March 2nd Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<p>Rome Water Supply Cut Off After Repeated Air Raids</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the enemy planes carried out the twenty-second and twenty-third air raids on Rome, the water supply in Rome was cut off on the 11th. Three of the four major pumping stations were hit by bombs. Long queues of people lined up to collect water next to the faucets where the tap water had not yet stopped.</p>
<p>Situation in Southern Italy</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - This afternoon's German war report stated: Enemy outposts in Italy are becoming active again. South and southwest of Cassino and north of Ciesina, the enemy launched an attack under the cover of heavy artillery. Our planes bombed the port of Anzio, heavily damaging a 1,000-ton transport ship.</p>
<p>The Pope Broadcasts Yesterday</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The United Press reported: The Pope is scheduled to deliver a speech in St. Peter's Square in Rome at 3:00 PM today. Twenty-two loudspeakers have been set up. Four hundred churches will ring their bells at the same time before the speech begins. The German military authorities and the Italian municipal authorities have taken various preventive measures and dispatched cars to transport refugees to the square to participate in the grand ceremony.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Diplomatic Offensive Shows Failure</p>
<p>German Commentary on Irish Incident</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Regarding the Irish government's resolute rejection of the American request, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement yesterday, stating that due to the pressure from the anti-Axis countries, we were reminded of the recent pressures on Spain, Turkey, Portugal, Argentina, Finland, and other countries. However, up to now, the diplomatic efforts of the anti-Axis countries can be said to have been completely frustrated. Judging from the recent attitude of the Turkish people and media, one can understand that the results of their offensive against Turkey have not achieved any results. At the same time, the Argentine nationalists who cannot tolerate the oppression of the United States have risen up to establish a new government. Spain is also unwilling to succumb to the oppression of Britain and the United States and continues to adhere to neutrality. At the same time, Finland's refusal to succumb to the anti-Axis camp can also be seen from recent facts.</p>
<p>Meeting to Be Held Soon for Anglo-American Adjustment of Relations</p>
<p>Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuter reported: Well-informed sources in London said that negotiations on Anglo-American mutual relations will begin soon. These negotiations will be initiated by the US Undersecretary of State Stettinius. Stettinius will represent the US government in London. Stettinius recently told reporters that the anti-Axis countries must not abandon the principle of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>Turkish Parliamentarians Hold Secret Meeting</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Turkish Republican People's Party members suddenly held a secret meeting here on the 10th, drawing various discussions. The reason for the meeting is unknown.</p>

<h3>Solemn Commemoration of the 19th Anniversary of the Passing of the Founding Father Yesterday, Municipal Government Held Tree Planting Ceremony to Pay Respects to Mausoleum from Afar</h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the anniversary of the passing of the Founding Father. All circles in Shanghai flew flags at half-mast in commemoration. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government also held a solemn tree-planting ceremony yesterday morning. Present were the heads of various bureaus and departments under the municipal government. Secretary-General Zhao, on behalf of Mayor Chen, performed the rituals. After silently praying and paying respects to the Founding Father's mausoleum, a report was given, elaborating in detail on the teachings of the Founding Father and the significance of the commemoration. At around 11 o'clock, everyone went to the open space in front of the Economic Bureau to plant trees. After taking a photo, the ceremony concluded with the uplifting sound of military music.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Issues Proclamation to the Public</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special Municipality, in commemoration of the 19th anniversary of the Founding Father's passing, held a solemn memorial ceremony at 10 a.m. yesterday, jointly with all working comrades of the China Youth Model Corps' 4th Detachment, the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League General Association of China, etc. Chairman Liu Shanyang personally presided over the ceremony. In the afternoon, personnel were dispatched to various public places to distribute a proclamation to the public, the original text of which is recorded below:</p>
<p>Refine Resolve and Vigilance to Fulfill the Legacy</p>
<p>Today, in the 14th year of the Republic (1925), is the day the Founding Father passed away in Beijing. It has been exactly nineteen years now. Looking back over this long period, what have we accomplished in fulfilling the Founding Father's legacy? We should constantly refine our resolve and vigilance to fulfill the Founding Father's legacy.</p>
<p>Today, on the occasion of the 19th anniversary of his passing, coincides with the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War. At this moment, we deeply feel the greatness of the Founding Father, with his foresight and long-range vision, having foreseen the arrival of this era. Therefore, he earnestly instructed us with "Asia is the Asia of Asians," and gave a detailed description of the Eastern way of benevolent governance and the Western way of hegemonic governance, saying, "Advocating the way of benevolent governance is to promote benevolence, righteousness, morality, and to influence people with justice and reason. Advocating the way of hegemonic governance is to coerce people with guns and cannons..." Now, Europe and America are using their hegemonic power, arrogantly and recklessly, to harm our Asia. Taking China alone, the oppression and suffering we have endured since the Opium War are too numerous to record, nearly a century. Even our friendly nation, Japan, was the same as China before the Meiji Restoration. However, after the Restoration, it strived for strength and abolished unequal treaties. Therefore, the Founding Father regarded the Meiji Restoration in Japan as the starting point for the rejuvenation of the entire Asia. Later, Japan's victory over Russia greatly shook the Asian nations. In the twenty years since then, Egypt, Turkey, Afghanistan, and Arabia successively achieved independence, and all Asian nations united.</p>
<p>Strive for the Final Victory in East Asia</p>
<p>The era that the Founding Father hoped for has finally arrived, and it has reached the final, crucial juncture. How should we accomplish this great mission? What is gratifying is that the unequal treaties, which the Founding Father never forgot, have been abolished with the assistance of our allied nation Japan, which treats us as equals, and the concessions were returned last year. Extraterritoriality has been abolished, and all unequal treaties have been eliminated. This can comfort the spirit of the Founding Father in heaven. In the future, we should work harder, follow his teachings, and cooperate with our allied nations to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a conflict between European and American hegemony and the Eastern way of benevolent governance. Therefore, our country's participation in the war is not using violence to assist violence. The Founding Father explained this reason most clearly: "To influence Europeans with benevolence and righteousness and to ask the Europeans in Asia to peacefully return our rights is like seeking the skin of a tiger, which is impossible. To completely recover our rights, we must resort to force." Therefore, this war is to use force to recover our rights, not to invade others. The Founding Father also said: "Hegemony must submit to the way of benevolent governance." Therefore, our entire Asian nation, with hundreds of millions of people, uniting and fighting against the hegemonic Britain and America, will surely make them submit.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War has now reached the decisive stage. Our allied nation, Japan, is shouldering the responsibility at the front lines, and we have an unshirkable responsibility in the rear. However, Chongqing's blind resistance war has dragged on until now, destroying almost all of the existing resources and the budding industry. Now we must rebuild, which requires redoubled hard work and diligence. Moreover, the economy is a crucial part of the total war. Therefore, the most urgent task in the rear is to increase production. From this, we ask all sectors of agriculture, industry, commerce, and the industry, as well as our party comrades, to unite and shoulder this major mission to fulfill the responsibility of the rear.</p>
<p>Hope the Public will Rise up Unitedly</p>
<p>The Chongqing government's resistance war is using violence to assist violence. The suffering we have endured from the resistance war in recent years is countless. This disastrous measure that harms the country and the people not only violates the teachings of the Founding Father, it is a betrayal of the Founding Father and a betrayal of the entire Asian nation. Recalling that when the Founding Father entered Beijing in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the Beijing government sent two representatives to welcome him. At that time, Duan Qirui had just sent documents respecting treaties to the foreign ambassadors. When the Founding Father learned of this, he sternly said to the two representatives: "I am outside to abolish the unequal treaties, but you in Beijing insist on respecting those unequal treaties. Why is this? If you want to get promoted and make a fortune, and you are afraid of those foreigners and want to respect them, then why are you here to welcome me?" Think about it, isn't the current Chongqing government exactly the same as the Beijing government at that time? They want to rely on Europeans and Americans to fight for independence and autonomy, which is like seeking the skin of a tiger. Look around at reality again, and the right and wrong, gains and losses, are self-evident. Since we admire the Founding Father, we hope that all the people of the country, starting from today, will rise up unitedly and awaken the Chongqing government, turning around and realizing their errors, and jointly march towards the bright path indicated by the Founding Father, in order to defend East Asia and complete the rejuvenation of China.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Discovered in the Xinzha Road Area</h3>
<p>Following the discovery of smallpox in the Western District, several households in the Xinzha Road area of District One have recently also been found with smallpox. It is understood that this phenomenon has already attracted the attention of the Hygiene Bureau. In addition to instructing some hygiene branch offices to increase the time for vaccinations, mobile vehicles have been dispatched to check vaccination certificates along the road, and those without certificates are forcibly vaccinated. At the same time, the Industry Bureau believes that the Xinzha Road area and its neighboring roads are areas with a concentration of factories, and the prevalence of smallpox poses a threat to the hygiene of the factories. Therefore, it has been decided to start this week to vaccinate all workers in factories in the area.</p>
<p>Preventive Injections for Meningitis</p>
<p>Recently, the prevalence of meningitis in the city has become increasingly active. The health authorities have formulated measures to deal with it. In addition to instructing residents to pay attention to cleanliness, they have also designated health branches to inject preventive vaccines. Since the population of Shanghai exceeds four million, it is difficult for the health authorities alone to carry out injections universally. Therefore, it is best for various industrial and commercial organizations to carry out preventive injections for their employees and their families within the possible range.</p>
<h3>Rice Control Committee Rectifies Internal Personnel</h3>
<p>Since the Rice Control Committee held its first joint meeting, it has planned to rectify the soundness of internal personnel. Recently, internal personnel have been reorganized. It is reported that fifteen members of the preparatory committee will resign. Regarding the procurement plan for this year, the Rice Control Committee will adopt a policy of emphasizing quality over quantity. In other words, the number of procurement merchants in Areas A and B this year will be reduced from more than three hundred to about one hundred.</p>
<h3>Motor Vehicles to Reissue New Permits</h3>
<p>The current twelfth term of motor vehicle operating permits in this city will expire at the end of this month. Car owners who wish to continue to use their cars must obtain an application form before the 18th of this month (those who obtained licenses from the Public Works Bureau should obtain the form directly from the Bureau; those who obtained licenses from District One should obtain the form from the Taishan Road Central District Office of the Bureau), fill in the reasons, and request the issuance of the thirteenth term of the permit. It is learned that the Municipal Public Works Bureau and its Central District Office are actively carrying out the review procedures and preparing to reissue the new permits starting from the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Sales Must Comply with Price Limits</h3>
<p>Recently, various vegetables have continued to be transported to Shanghai. Moreover, during the Spring Festival period, vegetables grow particularly quickly. In addition to the Central Market continuously transporting vegetables, farmers from the suburbs are also carrying vegetables to Shanghai to sell at stalls in various small vegetable markets. Therefore, the supply of vegetables is very plentiful, but the market price is rising steadily. It is reported that the relevant authorities will strictly control the price increases. In the future, the market price of any vegetable sold must comply with the prices posted in the market. Deceptive practices are prohibited, otherwise, punishment will be meted out.</p>
<p>Singers Respond to Aircraft Donation Campaign by Holding Singing Competition</p>
<p>Since the public aircraft donation campaign was launched in this city, all sectors have enthusiastically responded. For example, China Film Company, the Peking opera circles, etc., have launched fundraising activities to contribute to the grand event. It is learned that the singers in this city, represented by Gao Le Opera House and Times Theater, have jointly agreed with the Municipal Aircraft Donation Campaign Committee to hold the first singing competition at the New World Gao Le Opera House on the 16th of this month, and the second singing competition at the Times Theater on Second Ma Road on the 17th. It is reported that the "Victory Cup" for the competition has been prepared, and celebrities will be invited to present the awards at that time.</p>

<h3>Friendly Society Suffers Bitter Defeat to Overseas Chinese Football Team</h3>
<p>3-5 action deviates from the course of the Shanghai League A football match. In a brilliant game between the Friendly Society and the Overseas Chinese, which occurred yesterday morning at ten thirty at the Yiyuan Field, ten thousand people were present and it was incredibly packed, with fans overflowing everywhere, reflecting the great appeal. Yesterday, the course of battle, due to excessive tension, resulted in a small number of players acting erratically and almost causing an unpleasant ending. Luckily, the organizers made every effort to mediate, and the battle hastily concluded, which was a blemish on an otherwise good event. The Friendly Society, due to insufficient strength in the later stages, lost to the Overseas Chinese by three goals to five, and from now on, the Friendly Society's hope for the championship is slim. The first half was a draw. The referee was He Chunhui.</p>
<p>Each Team Ties with One Goal</p>
<p>The Friendly Society kicked off, with the Overseas Chinese playing with the wind. The Friendly Society's entire army advanced, and Overseas Chinese's Maicheti inadvertently touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Wenkui took the shot, and the ball hit the right corner, and the Overseas Chinese's first gate was broken. After five minutes, the Overseas Chinese launched a major counterattack, with fierce momentum. Zheng Yingquan made a strong save, almost causing a comic own goal. At the 30-minute mark, Overseas Chinese's Kapaiwei broke through the center, pulled his leg and fiercely kicked, but Liu Xianhan got the ball and then lost it again, resulting in a one-on-one tie. The first half temporarily came to an end.</p>
<p>Launch Fierce Battle In the sound of renewed battle, the game still unfolded as a fierce struggle. Qu Yongfu intercepted the ball and accidentally hit his arm, resulting in a free kick. Overseas Chinese's Bao Jie took the kick and hit the target in one go. In the ninth minute, Friendly Society's Wu Qixiang took advantage of the enemy's internal weakness, alone and unaided, and snatched back a goal in the chaos, again making it two to two. Overseas Chinese's Mainiti once used an excellent move to grab Xu Wenkui's penalty area kick. Fei Chunhua diagonally shot from the border, and the Friendly Society instead took the lead with three to two. Good fortune does not last long, and Gao Baozheng fouled, resulting in a free kick. Liu Xianhan strongly blocked a corner kick, but unexpectedly disaster struck, and Li Tiansheng headed the ball poorly, and Bao Jie made it three goals each. Later, misfortune befell the Friendly Society, and Kapaiwei struck a decisive blow, contributing to the victory, causing the Friendly Society players' tempers to rise. Tuoshalini scored another goal, adding fuel to the fire, and the battle gradually deviated from the right track, and the fighting became incongruous. Later, it hastily ended. Overseas Chinese finally defeated the Friendly Society with five to three. Overseas Chinese: Mainiti, Luo Xulai, Maicheti, Pai Jiani, Xiladi, Xuewei, Taibili, Aotuoshalini, Taike Nike, Kapaiwei, Baojie, Weilalianyi: Liu Xianhan, Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng, Qu Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Zhou Qilin, Fang Jin Wenkui, Wu Qixiang, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua</p>

<p>Economic Affairs</p>
<h3>Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Conditions in the City Stabilized Last Week, Hoarders Sold Off Stocks at Reduced Prices</h3>
<p>The financial, industrial, and commercial conditions in this city have stabilized last week after a period of turmoil. In the past two months, large-scale hoarding of goods and soaring prices have caused unrest in society and the people's livelihood. Most of the funds have accumulated on domestic goods. Therefore, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, the government suddenly took severe measures. In addition to intensifying investigations into hoarding and cracking down on it, the Central Bank of China tightened interbank lending. That is, any applications for lending from firms used for hoarding major commodities or for making major commodity mortgage loans are strictly rejected. At the same time, restrictions were placed on firms using their own funds to underwrite major commodity mortgage loans. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has also begun to implement inspections of financial institutions' loan businesses. If it is found that funds are being used to underwrite major commodity mortgage loans, which may encourage hoarding, the authorities will be notified immediately for strict action.</p>
<p>Therefore, starting last week, several firms were unable to sell off their hoarded goods, and their funds suddenly felt the strain of being unable to turn over, resulting in a stranded situation. Fortunately, the Silver and Money Trade Association devised a way to help them sell off the hoarded goods at reduced prices to compensate for the losses, and they were able to overcome this difficulty. After the Central Bank of China continued to maintain the proper interbank lending business, the financial institutions' rocking wind was finally calmed, and credit gradually eased. Most hoarders, fearing that the authorities would find out, confiscate, and punish them, sold off their stocks at reduced prices, and prices continued to fall. Therefore, in the past week, stock prices continued to fall, and rice, coal, and all daily necessities saw a decline of more than 20%. If the authorities can continue to enforce restrictions on mortgage loans and investigate hoarding, prices will continue to fall.</p>
<h3>All Commercial Trades Open as Usual Today</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Trade Association requires that all businesses, in accordance with the association's holiday schedule, will not be closed for the anniversary of the Founding Father's death. Therefore, today (Monday), all businesses will be operating as usual, except for national banks.</p>
<h3>Various Silk Weaving Factories in the City Seek to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Cloth stores in the city have stopped selling cotton cloth for half a year, making it difficult for people to purchase clothing. The reporter recently learned from the silk industry that due to the inability to purchase cotton cloth, the demand for silk in the market has greatly increased, and various silk reeling factories and weaving mills are now striving to increase production. According to reports, the silk weaving factories in the city once suffered a setback after the incident, but now the factories that have been shut down have resumed production one after another. At the same time, due to the good harvest, raw materials can also be continuously obtained. However, production is currently limited by electricity restrictions, so production has not yet reached its highest level. It is also learned that the stock of silk in this city is quite sufficient, and the factories are continuously delivering goods. Therefore, the large quantities are gradually flowing downstream, but the retail prices in the retail stores have not fallen.</p>
