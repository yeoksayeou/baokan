<h3>昨開全體會一致決議通過各重要議案</h3>
<p>○東京二十五日中央社電　日樞密院全體會議，二十五日上午十時在宮中舉行，由天皇陛下親臨主持，出席者樞府方面有鈴木正議長，清水副議長暨各顧問官，政府方面有小礒首相暨各閣僚，重光外相兼大東亞相以事缺席，案件報告其經過情形，嗣後由各顧問官分別提處質問，末由全塲一致將各案決議通過，於十一時許散會。</p>
<h3>菲東海面大戰殲敵良機已至任還長昨發表觀感</h3>
<p>○南京二十五日中央社電　盟邦海軍在台灣東薩賽島東方之捷報，又已傳至。此次戰果，計沉毀敵最新銳航空母艦達六艘之多，我大東亞十億民眾，對此捷報，實屬非常振奮。中央社記者昨特往訪國府海軍部長任援道氏，叩詢任氏對此次大戰果之觀感，當承發表談話如下：敵美海軍在台灣東方海面大敗之餘，不顧一切，貿然在菲律賓方面作登陸之嘗試，此舉實至爲愚蠢。但敵美太平洋海軍司令自　其不得不如此嘗試之苦衷，而羅斯福總統亦已四屈改選關係，圖謀欺騙民眾，不得不輕舉妄動。吾人就軍事上觀測，敵美侵略台灣之時，已有作在菲律賓登陸之預備，此蓋明知在台灣方面必致失敗，失敗之後，即不得不改變其戰略也。然此種蠢舉，正於日本有利，吾人可以斷言，敵人登陸之軍隊愈眾，則予日本之便利亦愈多，實予日本以殲滅敵人之良好機遇。今次機遇業已來臨，日本自不能輕易放過，此在前次台灣東方海面，及今日菲律賓方面之二次大捷，足資證實，由於戰果，吾人益可深信大東亞戰爭之必勝，我全國人民應即認清自身爲東亞之東亞人，從速捐棄前嫌，參加此大東亞戰爭。抑最近之海戰情形，已一變其過去之性格，以往如黃海等地之大戰，乃爲平面作戰，而現在則已轉變至立體作戰，吾人若明瞭該項海戰性格，則可確知日本艦隊之於此時期出動，實爲其與敵美海軍總結算之良好機遇已告來臨也。</p>
<h3>新民會全聯會今在平揭幕</h3>
<p>○北平二十五日中央社電　三十三年度新民會全體聯合協議會，二十六日起在平揭幕，各省市代表已於日前分別來平。</p>
<h3>主要商品品目表修正昨經行政院會議通過</h3>
<p>○南京二十四日中央社電　實業部主管之主要商品品目表，係於三十年公布施行，所列品目記十九種，迨本年五月間因前糧食部併入實部關係，其主管主要商品亦由七種合併，前後合計有二十六種。茲實部將各該品目，按照地方經濟施策聯絡會議議決原則凡一與軍需有關者，二爲民生必需者，三因供求關係需要統治者，皆應列爲主要商品，予以合併整理修正。並爲使上項原則更臻具體起見，茲復以一施行統治者，二限制行動者，三實行評價者三要點，作爲修正之準則。關於該項修正主要商品品目表草案，業經陳部長呈送行政院於第二而八次會議通過，並呈中政會備案公佈施行。查此次修正之品目表，係增加米殺及白報紙兩項，而茶葉及玻璃兩項並未列入。蓋米榖一項前稱米糧，原係主要商品，惟以實施統制設有專管部門，故未在普通主要商品之列。本年五月糧食部奉令撤銷，並米糧亦准自由買賣，爲使於管理起見，特增入本表之內。又白報紙關係文化事業至重且鉅，並各報業業由宣傳部實施配給，爲防止風積起見，故特列入本表爲品目之一，至茶葉及玻璃兩項，前雖列爲主要商品，惟茶葉一項尚未實施統制，至玻璃一項則因其製造原料，已於化學工業品類實施統制，故本表未列入。茲將修正後之該項品目表全文錄後：一糧食，（一）米榖，粳米稻米糯米及稻類，（二）麥粉，（三）雜糧，小麥大麥元麥大豆落花生高粱　豆豌豆綠豆玉蜀桼，（四）畜產，牛豬等，（五）蛋，鷄蛋，（六）糖，赤白砂糖，（七）食用油，豆油花生油菜子油棉子油。二纖維，（一）棉花，（二）棉紗，（三）棉製品布疋及針線品，（四）毛縬　　（五）毛製品，（六）爾，（七）絲，（八）人造絲，（九）絲織品，（十）原蔴（十一）蔴製品，（十二）交織品。三化學工業品，（一）西藥，（二）顏料，（三）染料，（四）酒精，（五）原料及其他製品。四工業油脂，五捲烟，六肥皂，七火柴，八煤，（一）塊煤，（二）煤球，（三）煤屑，九捲烟及烟業，十橡膠（包括原料及製品）十一五金（包括原料及製品），（一）鐡，（二）銅，（三）白鐡，（四）非鐡金屬，十二電氣器材，十三皮革（包括原料製品）十四白報紙。</p>
<h3>東普魯士展開坦克大會戰</h3>
<p>洪境蘇軍續施壓力</p>
<p>○柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：東普魯士邊境之大戰，幾盡爲機械化部隊，四時八小時內，毀蘇坦克車不下三百二是三輛，蘇軍不惜重大犧牲，俾得將戰事拓展至德國內部。據最近之觀察，蘇軍在德境內之損失，高出百分之四十。德軍長官現又吊動生力軍準備反攻，逐敵出境。本月底東普魯士之戰爭，將　見激烈蘇坦克被毀現逾七百輛</p>
<p>德軍事發言人昨夜謂，東普魯士境內之德軍應戰獲勝，總計蘇坦克軍被擊毀者已逾七百輛。　　○柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍初步侵入東普魯士之哥爾達普城之後，其推進已被阻。德軍由南及北向蘇軍之側慶進攻，已切　蘇軍之交通綫。蘇軍前後被夾攻，因此哥爾達普及岡比寗區之蘇軍大部均已撤退。蘇軍由浪沙與塞洛克攻擊米美爾之背後，已被德軍反攻所挫敗，故東普魯士邊界德軍之反措施頗收效巴爾幹前綫德軍力戰中</p>
<p>洪牙利戰塲，蘇軍向貝斯特之攻擊已稍懈，過去二十四小時僅有數營兵力進攻而已。索爾諾克區續在惡戰中，泰斯及多瑙河蘇軍續施壓力。希轈德軍慶續撤退中。</p>
<h3>重慶難民擁擠</h3>
<p>○里斯本二十五日中央社電　華南渝軍退敗後，四個月內已有數萬難民，行抵重慶。據重慶中央社調查，重慶人口已突破百萬。　　○柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍及保軍企圖切斷南路北路之交通，俾得實現包圍德軍之計劃，德軍力戰務使敵軍計劃不能成功。昨日德軍擊潰進攻之蘇軍坦克軍，予敵重創。克拉爾傑伏之東，蘇軍敷度進攻，企圖包圍孚爾巴之德軍陣地，德守軍已獲增援。</p>
<h3>洪牙利兵</h3>
<p>○洪京二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：洪報均載有徵兵制通告，凡一八九六級以後之官佐及准尉，以及一九○二年以後之後備兵，均須立即加入軍隊，此外體格健全而未當積極服兵役之人，亦應入伍。勒文特國家青年團團員，在一九二四至一九二伍之列，僅軍火工人及國衛隊人員，不在其現。</p>

<h3>西綫戰事焦點移荷蘭中部英加軍聯合攻勢受挫</h3>
<p>○里斯本二十五日中央社電　西綫亞琛地區戰事終結後，西綫戰爭焦點已移至最北冀之荷蘭中部，英第二軍以有力之機甲部隊在赫陀根波什東北部發動攻勢，德軍刻仍猛烈抵抗中。其他接近德境各地亦俱開始激戰，該地區中一二處現在降雪，兩軍間之攻防戰極感苦難。　　○柏林二十五日中央社電　海通社訊：安特衛普港入口仍告阻塞，不能使敵人進入，由此可證些耳德河口德軍炮火之威力。敵於些耳德河口屢功不克，乃以大軍於羅遜達爾——布萊達——捷爾堡一綫猛攻，於星期一始獲推進，然並未能突破德方防綫。英俊於星期日以來亦向赫陀根波什進攻，藉以大規模之包抄行動，威脀些耳德。繆斯。萊茵河口之德陣地，英軍於星期一猶僅在赫陀根波什城之外　。蓋稜克兩側美第一軍仍猛攻不已，如大攻勢果於此處發動，則其攻勢除東向外，且將北向及東北向，以呼應英第二軍自尼美根橋頭堡沿繆斯河東岸向蓋爾登威塞爾推進至趨勢。</p>
<h3>反軸心國會議明年初召集</h3>
<p>○柏林二十五中央日社電　海通社訊，德外部發言人論英外相艾登雅典之行稱：莫斯科會議中，必已根據蘇聯巴爾幹聯邦內設立馬其頓國之原則，而議定瓜分希臘之計劃，希臘之南部將入英勢力範圍，北部及東部則將歸入蘇勢力圈。艾登此次赴雅典，乃欲說希臘當局接受此議也。德外部且悉艾登並將赴貝爾格勒晤蒂托，說明南王彼得與蒂托所應訂立之協定。艾登或將赴羅馬一行，以解決西西里之爭端。艾登此外或將訪問土京，使土當局明瞭英國不能使蘇聯延緩談論韃靵尼爾問題之困難。英經濟家雄誌近復謂，蘇聯將堅持德黑蘭會議中伊朗油權之要求，此乃莫斯科近東積極政策之一部。</p>
<h3>希臘組成臨時政府</h3>
<p>○里斯本二十五日中央社電　據此間本日所獲消息，希臘臨時政府成立：總理兼外長及軍政部長巴班特魯。</p>
<h3>吳縣近況</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>吳縣在昔春秋時爲吳國之都，秦漢曰會稽，後漢五代改稱吳州，至隨置蘇州，宋元時曰平江，明爲蘇州府，清因之，爲江蘇省會，民國建立，省會移南京，合長洲吳縣元和三縣，及太湖靖湖二應，改爲吳縣，近仍改爲省會。城南有青陽地，　爲日木租借地，闢爲商埠，於民國三十二年三月三十日由在大東亞互惠平等原則下，交還我國。近幾年來，因鄉區散匪流痞猖獗日甚，當地部隊混雜，勒索在所不免，一般稍有聲譽，及務辳爲生差堪溫飽者，頗多遷來城，其數與日俱增。據最近八月份人口統計，城區男二三二二九二名，女一八九六八四名，鄉區男三三三二九九名，女三○九一三五名，令未清鄉區共三區，男五七六九二名，女四四三一一名，全縣共計男六二三二八三名，女五四三一三○名，男女合計一一六六四一三名，人口激增，於是可見一斑。交通方面情形</p>
<p>京滬鐵道中，蘇州爲大站，蘇嘉鐵路在蘇爲起點，暫不通車，由本炭汽車替代往來於吳江嘉與木常熱間，日有數班，惜乎粥少僧多，加之司機員工爲獲取本身利益，實際難免有沙丁之感。近聞交通當局尚擬恢復城區汽車，一由火車站經金門至觀前，一由觀前至老圑門，一由觀前至胥門，境內河流縱橫，小汽船東由蘇州至上海爲一綫，西北由運河經無錫常州至鎮江爲一綫，西南由胥江經香山渡太湖至湖州爲一綫，而橫經盛澤木漬周莊角直陳墓等處，亦均有小汽船往來，輸航船埠頭，圛胥磐齊四門均有之，而以金圑二門爲最多。記者爲明瞭水道現況，及深入晨村與安全起見，會由無錫搭乘汽船沿運河至蘇州，歴時六小時，所經村鎮均駐有軍警部隊，稅關不合理之需索，隨　餉不足糊口而花樣百出，近稍改善，似不多見了。金融與商業一般</p>
<p>本城區在事變時，物資損失，雖受十室九空之劫，然各建築物仍能屹立幸存，秩序恢復甚快。現有銀行三十家，錢莊滙劃等有八十家之多，因此商業鼎盛，市道櫛比，熱鬧繁華之區，仍推觀前，次之閻門內外，及飬育巷臨頓路，商肆駢立，倍於海上。記者蒞蘇第二日下午約有小徐，三人各飲咖啡一杯，餅二枚，臨行所費一零零十張，不無吝惜，其他酒菜館如味雅及海派正宗老正與名稱，有上海蘇州真正之別，真如陸稿薦之遍處皆是。吳人考究飲食不亞粵省，尤其時代紅兒囤積暴發者，粟集省垣，非獨該業座上客常滿，即一般旅館客店，莫不利市百倍，烟賭隨起，整日門神門智，勒索詐欺　投機橈倖，所獲之阿睹物，至是交換，便面畸形到處皆然，若加以分析，社會陰面在生活高壓之下，苟延殘喘，日不得以飽者，何止萬千。縣政與治安見聞</p>
<p>吳縣因蜀省垣，　區遼闊，人口密集之故，在事變前有設市之說，現劃分爲十五行政區，十二區在李前省長時已清響完睪，另有三區迄未清鄉，爲［奮五區］橫經鎮，［奮十二區］洞庭東山，［奮十三區］洞庭西山。據駐防蘇垣之第二師師長任祖萱氏告記者云，蓋太湖流域之未清鄉區，民行強悍，他方遷居來此墾荒者甚多，設若該區歉收，即出爾爲虐，流爲散匪，附近居民受害不淺，即離城區稍徧之區，如鐵路拖北縣境交界地區亦然，尤以鄰縣宜與溧陽爲烈。記者爲明鄉區真象起見，曾薮歷鄉鎮衛土，大公無私，爲鄉民所愛戴者，不乏其人，然難免仍有受環境感化，乘機漁利，勢焰高漲魚肉鄉民者，彼輩有，而吞其田產者。狡者結黨抗拒，如法效尤，軍民間築成鴻溝，影響和運及鄉土治安匪淺。本縣縣長沈靖華聯心民膜，時至鄉區視察，對於刷新區政，不遺餘力。教育刷新動態</p>
<p>本縣教育局負責者數易其人，因奉令刷新，接收私立各學校改爲縣辦，推行不無困難，現任局長　　　，新由教應派委，承告記者施教實況新教育，初等與中等教育並重，這如課程教學時間之統一，學校行政經濟之控制，勞働生產教育之提倡，國民義務教育之擴充推進，使失學兒童逐漸減少，裕達上述目的，故將各私立學校一律接收縣辦，使教政運用一元化。據第八行政區［城區］最近統計學齡兒童數達五萬二千六百餘人，已入學者祗二萬九千二百六十二人，失學者約佔二萬三千四百人，按自刷新教育實施迄今，失學者已減少一萬三千七百五十七人，統計全縣有中小學一百九十所，內分省立男中四所，女中一所，省立教育學院及附屬師範一所，省立日語專門學校一所，縣立男中二所，女中一所，私立男中九所，女中一所，首席中心一所，中心小學十八所，完小五十六所，初小八十一所，簡小十四所，另實驗民教一所，普通民教三所，簡易民教三所，辳民教育館四所，省立圖書館一所，縣立圖書館一所，縣公園一所，省公共體育摥一所，教育推進當在不斷邁進，惜乎經費　捪維艱，因而影響施教人員待遇及學校設施。綜觀各縣辳邨</p>
<p>蘇垣濱臨太湖，水道密佈，灌溉本可無憂，辳產物向以米麥爲大宗，往年自給有餘，時楯秋收，記者至各縣訪問，田野一望無際　但到處穗子灰白色，佔三四成者尚蜀橈倖，六七成者幾乎觸目皆是，經詢辳人，據云此謂白蛸　原因去歲冬雪未降，土壤蟲卵得以慶生，咀啮稻桿中心，雨水不調，白露下霧連雨，遂致枯萎，酦成白蛸。辳民烈日下辛勞，至是全功付之東流，受害最烈之地，每畝晚稻收穫不及一斗，軍需民食，加之完糧納賦，影響匪淺。總之，鄉間呌苦，城區挨餞，試以糧價飛鷹，百物雲從，當不爲無因。據某辳人云，收割後，即使將稻種涡滴　公，亦將無法彌補，祗有田賦減輕，茍雜概免，救濟地主佃辳，以免菓田出亡，　成不了之局，則幸甚矣。</p>

<h3>交通安全運動今日開始推行</h3>

<h3>Yesterday's Plenary Session Unanimously Passed Important Resolutions</h3>
<p>○Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Privy Council held a plenary session at the Imperial Palace at 10:00 a.m. on the 25th. His Majesty the Emperor presided over the meeting. Attendees from the Privy Council included Speaker Suzuki Masa, Deputy Speaker Shimizu, and various advisors. From the government side, Prime Minister Koiso and his cabinet ministers were present. Foreign Minister and Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Shigemitsu was absent due to other engagements. The progress of the cases was reported, followed by questions from the advisors. Finally, all attendees unanimously passed the resolutions, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 11:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>The Great Battle in the Philippine Sea Offers a Great Opportunity to Annihilate the Enemy. Minister Ren Expresses His Views Yesterday</h3>
<p>○Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The good news of the Allied naval victory east of Taiwan and east of Saipan has once again arrived. This battle resulted in the sinking of as many as six of the enemy's newest aircraft carriers, which has greatly inspired the one billion people of Greater East Asia. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically visited Minister of Naval Affairs Ren Yuandao of the National Government to inquire about his views on this great victory. Minister Ren graciously made the following remarks: The enemy American navy, after suffering a major defeat in the waters east of Taiwan, recklessly attempted a landing in the Philippines, which is an extremely foolish move. However, the commander of the enemy American Pacific Fleet is aware of the difficulties of avoiding such an attempt, and President Roosevelt, facing re-election for the fourth time, is seeking to deceive the public and has no choice but to act rashly. From a military perspective, we can observe that the enemy Americans had prepared for a landing in the Philippines when they invaded Taiwan, as they clearly knew that they would inevitably fail in Taiwan and would have to change their strategy after the failure. However, this foolish move is actually beneficial to Japan. We can assert that the more enemy troops that land, the more convenient it will be for Japan, as it provides Japan with a good opportunity to annihilate the enemy. Now that this opportunity has arrived, Japan must not let it go easily. The two major victories, the previous one east of Taiwan and the current one in the Philippines, sufficiently prove this. Based on the results of these battles, we are even more deeply convinced of the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War. Our entire nation should recognize themselves as East Asians of East Asia, quickly abandon past grievances, and participate in this Greater East Asia War. Furthermore, the recent naval warfare situation has changed its past character. Past major battles, such as those in the Yellow Sea, were planar operations, while now they have transformed into three-dimensional operations. If we understand the nature of this naval warfare, we can be certain that the Japanese fleet's deployment at this time is a good opportunity for a final reckoning with the enemy American navy.</p>
<h3>The National General Association of the New People's Society Opens in Peiping Today</h3>
<p>○Beiping, 25th (Central News Agency) - The General United Conference of the New People's Society for the 33rd year will open in Peiping on the 26th. Representatives from various provinces and cities have arrived in Peiping in the past few days.</p>
<h3>The Revised List of Major Commodities Was Approved by the Executive Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>○Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - The list of major commodities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry was promulgated and implemented in the 30th year, listing 19 items. In May of this year, due to the merger of the former Ministry of Food into the Ministry of Industry, its seven major commodities were also merged, totaling 26 items before and after. The Ministry of Industry has now merged, organized, and revised these items according to the principles decided by the Local Economic Policy Liaison Conference: those related to military needs, those essential to people's livelihood, and those that need to be controlled due to supply and demand should all be listed as major commodities. In order to make the above principles more concrete, three key points are added as criteria for revision: those subject to implementation control, those subject to restricted actions, and those subject to evaluation implementation. The draft list of revised major commodities has been submitted by Minister Chen to the Executive Yuan and passed at the 282nd meeting, and submitted to the Central Political Committee for record, promulgation and implementation. The revised list increases rice bran and white paper, while tea and glass are not included. Rice was previously referred to as "rice grain," which was originally a major commodity, but it was not included in the ordinary major commodity list because there was a special management department for its implementation control. In May of this year, the Ministry of Food was ordered to be abolished, and the free trade of rice grain was also permitted. For the sake of management, it is specially added to this list. In addition, white paper is of great importance to the cultural industry, and the newspaper industry is distributed by the Propaganda Department to prevent speculative hoarding, so it is specially listed in this table as one of the items. Although tea and glass were previously listed as major commodities, tea has not yet been subject to control, and the raw materials for glass manufacturing have been subject to control as chemical industrial products, so they are not included in this table. The full text of the revised list of items is recorded below: 1. Food (1) Rice: japonica rice, indica rice, glutinous rice, and rice varieties (2) Wheat flour (3) Coarse grains: wheat, barley, naked barley, soybeans, peanuts, sorghum, broad beans, peas, mung beans, corn (4) Livestock: cattle, pigs, etc. (5) Eggs: chicken eggs (6) Sugar: white and brown sugar (7) Edible oil: soybean oil, peanut oil, rapeseed oil, cottonseed oil. 2. Fiber (1) Cotton (2) Cotton yarn (3) Cotton products: cloth and needlework (4) Woolens (5) Wool products (6) Flax (7) Silk (8) Rayon (9) Silk fabrics (10) Raw hemp (11) Hemp products (12) Blended fabrics. 3. Chemical Industrial Products (1) Western medicine (2) Pigments (3) Dyes (4) Alcohol (5) Raw materials and other products. 4. Industrial Oils and Fats 5. Cigarettes 6. Soap 7. Matches 8. Coal (1) Lump coal (2) Coal briquettes (3) Coal dust 9. Cigarettes and the tobacco industry 10. Rubber (including raw materials and products) 11. Metals (including raw materials and products) (1) Iron (2) Copper (3) White iron (4) Non-ferrous metals 12. Electrical Equipment 13. Leather (including raw materials and products) 14. White Paper.</p>
<h3>Tank Battles Unfold in East Prussia</h3>
<p>Soviet Forces Continue to Exert Pressure</p>
<p>○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: The battles on the border of East Prussia are almost entirely mechanized. In four to eight hours, no fewer than 323 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. The Soviet forces are sparing no heavy sacrifices in order to extend the war into the interior of Germany. According to recent observations, Soviet losses within Germany are 40% higher. German commanders are now mobilizing fresh troops to prepare a counterattack and drive the enemy out of the country. The war in East Prussia at the end of this month will be fierce. More than 700 Soviet Tanks Destroyed</p>
<p>A German military spokesman said last night that the German forces fighting in East Prussia have won, and a total of more than 700 Soviet tanks have been destroyed. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: After the initial Soviet invasion of Goldap in East Prussia, their advance has been halted. German forces are attacking the Soviet flank from the south and north, cutting off the Soviet lines of communication. The Soviet forces are being attacked from both sides, and as a result, most of the Soviet forces in the Goldap and Gumbinnen areas have retreated. The Soviet attacks on the rear of Memel from Rauschen and Szillen have been frustrated by German counterattacks. Therefore, the German counter-measures on the East Prussian border are proving effective. German Forces Fight Hard on the Balkan Front</p>
<p>On the Hungarian battlefield, the Soviet attacks on Budapest have slowed slightly, with only a few battalions attacking in the past 24 hours. Fierce fighting continues in the Szolnok area. Soviet forces continue to exert pressure on the Tisza and Danube rivers. German forces are continuing to retreat in Greece.</p>
<h3>Chungking Overcrowded with Refugees</h3>
<p>○Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - Since the retreat of the Yu army in South China, tens of thousands of refugees have arrived in Chungking within four months. According to a Central News Agency survey in Chungking, the population of Chungking has exceeded one million. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: Soviet and Bulgarian forces are attempting to cut off north-south lines of communication in order to encircle German forces. German forces are fighting hard to prevent the enemy from succeeding. Yesterday, German forces defeated attacking Soviet tank forces, inflicting heavy casualties. East of Kraljevo, Soviet forces launched a desperate attack, attempting to encircle German positions at Fojnica. The German defenders have been reinforced.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Soldiers</h3>
<p>○Budapest, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: Hungarian newspapers have published conscription notices. Officers and warrant officers from the 1896 class and reservists from the 1902 class must immediately join the army. In addition, those who are physically fit but have not served in active military service should also enlist.

<h3>Focus of Western Front Warfare Shifts to Central Netherlands; Anglo-Canadian Joint Offensive Frustrated</h3>
<p>○Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the end of the fighting in the Aachen area on the Western Front, the focus of the war has shifted to the central Netherlands in the northernmost part. The British Second Army launched an offensive with powerful mechanized units northeast of 's-Hertogenbosch, but German forces are still fiercely resisting. Fierce fighting has also begun in other areas close to the German border. Snow is falling in one or two places in the area, making offensive and defensive battles between the two armies extremely difficult. ○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: The entrance to the port of Antwerp remains blocked, preventing the enemy from entering, which demonstrates the power of the German artillery at the Scheldt estuary. The enemy has repeatedly failed to capture the Scheldt estuary, so they launched a fierce attack with large forces along the Roosendaal-Breda-Geertruidenberg line, and only made progress on Monday, but failed to break through the German defenses. Since Sunday, the British have also been attacking 's-Hertogenbosch, attempting a large-scale encirclement, threatening the German positions at the mouth of the Scheldt, Meuse, and Rhine rivers. On Monday, the British were still only outside the city of 's-Hertogenbosch. The U.S. First Army on both sides of Geilenkirchen is still attacking fiercely. If a major offensive is launched here, it will be directed not only east, but also north and northeast, to echo the British Second Army's advance from the Nijmegen bridgehead along the east bank of the Meuse towards Geldern and Wesel.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Conference to be Convened Early Next Year</h3>
<p>○Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - HTS reports: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman commented on British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Athens, saying: "At the Moscow Conference, a plan to divide Greece has certainly been discussed based on the Soviet principle of establishing a Macedonian state within the Balkan Federation. Southern Greece will fall within the British sphere of influence, while northern and eastern Greece will fall within the Soviet sphere." Eden's trip to Athens is to persuade the Greek authorities to accept this agreement. The German Foreign Ministry also knows that Eden will also go to Belgrade to meet with Tito to explain the agreement to be concluded between King Peter of Yugoslavia and Tito. Eden may also visit Rome to resolve the dispute over Sicily. Eden may also visit Ankara to make the Turkish authorities understand the difficulty of the UK preventing the Soviet Union from delaying discussions on the Dardanelles issue. The British Economist magazine recently stated that the Soviet Union will insist on its demand for Iranian oil rights in the Tehran Conference, which is part of Moscow's active Near East policy.</p>
<h3>Provisional Government Formed in Greece</h3>

<h3>Recent Situation in Wu County</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Wu County was the capital of the State of Wu in the Spring and Autumn period. During the Qin and Han dynasties, it was called Kuaiji. In the Later Han and Five Dynasties, it was renamed Wu Prefecture. During the Sui Dynasty, it was changed to Suzhou. During the Song and Yuan dynasties, it was called Pingjiang. During the Ming Dynasty, it was Suzhou Prefecture, and the Qing Dynasty followed suit as the capital of Jiangsu Province. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the provincial capital was moved to Nanjing. The three counties of Changzhou, Wu County, and Yuanhe, as well as the two waters of Taihu and Jinghu, were combined and renamed Wu County. Recently, it was renamed the provincial capital again. The Qingyang area south of the city was once a Japanese concession, opened as a commercial port, and returned to our country on March 30, 1943, under the principle of mutual benefit and equality in Greater East Asia. In recent years, due to the increasing prevalence of scattered bandits and vagrants in rural areas, and the mixed presence of local troops, extortion is inevitable. Many people with some reputation and those who make a living from farming and are able to make ends meet have moved to the city, and their numbers are increasing daily. According to the latest population statistics in August, the urban area has 232,292 men and 189,684 women, while the rural area has 333,299 men and 309,135 women. The unorganized rural areas have a total of three districts, with 57,692 men and 44,311 women. The entire county has a total of 623,283 men and 543,130 women, totaling 1,166,413 men and women. The rapid increase in population is evident. Transportation Situation</p>
<p>Suzhou is a major station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway starts in Suzhou, but is temporarily closed. It is replaced by charcoal-powered vehicles traveling between Wujiang, Jiaxing, and Changshu, with several trips per day. Unfortunately, there are too few seats for too many people, and the drivers and employees inevitably engage in sardine-like squeezing to obtain personal gain. Recently, it has been heard that the transportation authorities plan to restore automobiles in the urban area, one line from the railway station via Jinmen to Guanqian, one line from Guanqian to Laotuanmen, and one line from Guanqian to Xumen. The territory has rivers crisscrossing it. Small steamers travel east from Suzhou to Shanghai on one line, northwest along the canal via Wuxi and Changzhou to Zhenjiang on another line, and southwest along the Xujiang River via Xiangshan, across Taihu Lake, to Huzhou on another line. There are also small steamers traveling back and forth across Shengze, Muzhi, Zhouzhuang, and Jiaozhi Chenmu. The wharves for transportation boats are located at the four gates of Yi, Xu, Pan, and Qi, with the Jin and Tuan gates having the most. In order to understand the current state of the waterways and for safety reasons, this reporter took a steamer from Wuxi along the canal to Suzhou, which took six hours. All the villages and towns passed through had stationed military and police forces. Unreasonable exactions by the customs were common, and the tricks were endless due to insufficient salary. Recent improvements seem to be few and far between. General Financial and Commercial Situation</p>
<p>Although the urban area suffered the calamity of "nine out of ten houses empty" during the incident, the buildings were able to stand and survive fortunately, and order was restored quickly. There are currently 30 banks and more than 80 money houses and remittance agencies, which is why commerce is thriving. The bustling and prosperous area is still Guanqian, followed by the inside and outside of Yanmen, and Yuyuxiang and Lindun Road, where shops are lined up, more than in Shanghai. On the second afternoon of my visit to Suzhou, I had coffee with two friends, Mr. Xu. Each of us drank a cup of coffee and two pieces of cake, which cost 1,010 yuan before leaving, which was quite a pity. Other restaurants, such as Weiya and the authentic Shanghai-style Lao Zheng, have distinct Shanghai and Suzhou flavors, just like the everywhere-ness of Lu Gaojian. The people of Wu are as particular about food as those in Guangdong Province. In particular, the upstarts who have hoarded and made fortunes in these times have gathered in the provincial capital. Not only are the seats in the food and beverage industry always full, but also general hotels and inns are making a hundred times more profit. Gambling and prostitution follow, and door gods and door intelligences are extorted and cheated all day long. The money they earn from speculation and luck is exchanged here, and abnormal things are everywhere. If we analyze it, the dark side of society is struggling to survive under high pressure, and there are more than tens of thousands who cannot eat their fill every day. County Administration and Public Security Observations</p>
<p>Because Wu County is the provincial capital, the area is vast, and the population is dense, there was talk of establishing a city before the incident. It is now divided into 15 administrative districts. The 12 districts were cleared and reorganized during the tenure of former Provincial Governor Li. There are another three districts that have not yet been cleared and reorganized: [Fenwu District] Hengjing Town, [Fen Twelve District] Dongting East Mountain, and [Fen Thirteen District] Dongting West Mountain. According to Commander Ren Zuxuan of the Second Division stationed in Suzhou, the people in the uncleared areas of the Taihu Lake basin are fierce, and many people from other places have moved here to reclaim wasteland. If the area has a poor harvest, they will become bandits and harm the nearby residents. This is also true in areas slightly off the urban area, such as the border area north of the railway. This is especially true in the neighboring counties of Yixing and Liyang. In order to understand the true situation of the rural areas, this reporter has visited towns and villages and found that there are not a few people who are selfless and loved by the villagers. However, it is inevitable that there are still those who are influenced by the environment, take advantage of the opportunity to benefit themselves, and become powerful and oppressive to the villagers. There are those who swallow their property. Cunning people form gangs to resist, and the military and civilians build a wide gap, which greatly affects harmony and the public security of the rural areas. County Magistrate Shen Jinghua is committed to the people and often goes to the rural areas to inspect, sparing no effort to revitalize the district administration. Educational Revitalization Dynamics</p>
<p>The person in charge of the county's education bureau has changed several times. Due to the order to revitalize, it has been difficult to take over the private schools and convert them into county-run schools. The current director... was newly appointed by the Ministry of Education. He told reporters about the implementation of education: the new education emphasizes both primary and secondary education, such as the unification of curriculum, teaching time, control of school administration and economics, promotion of labor and production education, and expansion and promotion of national compulsory education to gradually reduce the number of out-of-school children. In order to achieve the above goals, all private schools will be taken over by the county, so that the education administration can be unified. According to the latest statistics in the eighth administrative district [urban area], the number of school-age children has reached more than 52,600, of whom only 29,262 have been enrolled, and about 23,400 are out of school. According to statistics, since the implementation of revitalized education, the number of out-of-school children has decreased by 13,757. According to statistics, there are 190 primary and secondary schools in the county, including 4 provincial boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 1 provincial education college and affiliated normal school, 1 provincial Japanese language specialized school, 2 county boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 9 private boys' middle schools, 1 girls' middle school, 1 chief center, 18 central primary schools, 56 complete primary schools, 81 junior primary schools, 14 simplified primary schools, 1 experimental people's education school, 3 ordinary people's education schools, 3 simple people's education schools, 4 farmers' education centers, 1 provincial library, 1 county library, 1 county park, and 1 provincial public sports center. The promotion of education is constantly moving forward, but unfortunately, funding is difficult, which affects the treatment of teaching staff and school facilities. Overview of Various County Farms</p>
<p>Suzhou is located on the shore of Taihu Lake, with a dense network of waterways, so irrigation can be worry-free. The main agricultural products are rice and wheat. In previous years, there was more than enough for self-sufficiency. When the autumn harvest arrives, this reporter visited various counties. The fields are vast, but everywhere the ears of rice are grayish-white, accounting for 30-40% in the most fortunate cases, and 60-70% in almost every case. After inquiring with the farmers, I learned that this is called "white awn." The reason is that there was no winter snow last year, so the insect eggs in the soil were able to survive, gnawing at the center of the rice stalks. The rainfall was not well-distributed, and the white dew and continuous rain caused them to wither and ferment into white awn. The farmers work hard under the scorching sun, but all their efforts are in vain. In the most severely affected areas, the harvest of late rice is less than one dou per mu. Military and civilian food needs, coupled with the payment of grain taxes, have a significant impact. In short, the countryside is complaining, and the urban area is suffering from hunger. The soaring price of grain and the following prices of all goods are not without reason. According to a farmer, even if the rice seeds are sown next year, it will be impossible to make up for the loss. Only by reducing land taxes, exempting miscellaneous taxes, and helping landlords and tenant farmers can we avoid their flight from the land and prevent an irremediable situation. That would be fortunate.</p>

<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign Starts Today</h3>
<p>Hoping that Citizens Will Strictly Abide by Traffic Rules</p>
<p>The city's police bureau has found that unfortunate traffic deaths and injuries have been increasing daily. The biggest reason is that citizens have not clearly understood traffic rules. Therefore, the [Safe Traffic Movement Week], sponsored by the administrative office, starts today (the 26th). In addition to ordering each branch bureau to send additional traffic police to guide traffic at key traffic points within their respective districts, self-defense corps members are also assisting in various districts. Newspapers and radio stations are also cooperating in promoting traffic essentials. A large number of slogans have also been posted throughout the city and on various vehicles, and large cloth slogans are hung at key traffic points, attracting attention.</p>
<h3>Warning Slogans</h3>
<p>The slogans are simple and cautionary, including [Safety First], [Caution Can Prevent Danger, Carelessness Can Easily Cause Trouble], [Be Sure to Look Left and Right Before Crossing the Road], [Do Not Cross the Road Between Parked Vehicles], [Be Especially Careful When Coming Out From Behind Vehicles], [Do Not Attach Bicycles to Moving Streetcars or Trucks], [Riding Two People on a Bicycle Is Most Likely to Cause Trouble], [Keep Left], [Do Not Ride Abreast], [Impatience and Carelessness Are Life-Threatening], [Caution and Care Are Life-Saving], etc.</p>
<h3>Safety Rules</h3>
<p>As for the [Safety First] rules for vehicles: 1. When entering a main road from a side road, be sure to drive slowly and give way to vehicles on the main road, 2. Do not take the wrong route when turning, 3. Be sure to signal when turning right or left, 4. When turning right, be sure to pay attention to whether there are vehicles overtaking you from behind, 5. When passing pedestrians, horses, bicycles, and other vehicles, give them plenty of space, 6. Give way to faster vehicles, 7. Strictly abide by traffic rules, which can save a lot of trouble, 8.

<h3>Actively Seeking to Suppress; Relevant Authorities Promise to Assist</h3>
<p>The price of firewood and charcoal fuel in this city has been soaring recently. Although there are many reasons for this, there is illegal extortion, such as the extraction of a handling fee of 630 yuan per ton for firewood and charcoal transported to Shanghai. With 70-80 boats arriving every day, each carrying 50 tons, this amounts to millions of yuan. Furthermore, a group of unscrupulous people, forming gangs, not only extort along the way, but also demand a "leaky sky" fee of several million yuan when they arrive at the dock. Because of this kind of inside story, the cost increases invisibly, so the price of goods has soared, increasing the burden on citizens. Members of the same industry, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, have repeatedly reported to the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association, requesting that measures be taken to crack down on it. After the association convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 13th of this month, the focus of discussion was that the fundamental solution must be to designate appropriate docks, concentrate loading and unloading, and handle it in a coordinated manner. At the same time, regulations must be taken to suppress market prices. After discussion, various measures were decided. Association Chairman Ni Boqi went to Director Xu of the Bureau of Economics, Director Yamaguchi of the Economic Security Office, and relevant authorities to discuss and negotiate repeatedly. The authorities are also very concerned about this matter and promised to provide thorough assistance. According to recent reports in the newspapers, the rise in firewood prices has attracted significant attention from society. If appropriate measures can be taken, it will not be difficult for market prices to stabilize. Enemy Planes Attacked Shanghai Suburbs Yesterday</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Shiitake</p>
<p>(8) The Young Arrival - Translated by Hong Yang -</p>
<p>After the memorial service, it was not until after 3 o'clock that the general public was allowed to perform flower offerings. Longfu's younger sister also squeezed into the crowd to go to the altar. Because there were too many people, it was impossible to worship as desired. The two people were jostled in the crowd and naturally walked to the Hibiya intersection.</p>
<p>Longfu remembered that he had not gone to the Navy Department today, so he looked at Xiang and said:</p>
<p>(I must go to the Navy Department for a while, you swear to go back to the apartment!)</p>
<p>(No, I'm going to the train station now...)</p>
<p>The younger sister replied quietly.</p>
<p>(To the train station?)</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The train is at 8 o'clock...</p>
<p>(What did you say?)</p>
<p>Longfu suspected that he had misheard and stared at his sister's face. Now he realized that his sister had come to Tokyo not to go to the Western Front School or some women's university.</p>
<p>(Paimo... Paimo, did you sincerely come to participate in the military memorial service?)</p>
<p>Longfu realized his sister's true intention and asked back.</p>
<p>(No, I am...)</p>
<p>The younger sister lowered her head slowly in shame, and after a while, she stared at her brother's face again. Her eyes seemed particularly bright.</p>
<p>(I'm here to pick up the remains and the nails. I know that I'm taking the 8:10 train home tonight...)</p>
<p>Longfu was even more surprised by his sister's words.</p>
<p>(Then isn't it you who is protecting and returning home with our mother and brother Siji?)</p>
<p>(That's their business, I'm here to accompany you according to my own wishes...)</p>
<p>The younger sister smiled slightly coldly. Now there was no more shame and sadness. An iron will and determination were expressed between her eyebrows. This expression was always seen in women in Kagoshima when their husbands died. For example, Zhenren's mother would have been like this when her husband died——</p>
<p>Longfu fully realized his sister's heart——the determination that dominated his sister's life. Hot tears burst out, and this was only for Longfu, while the sister was only going to Tokyo Station.</p>
<p>Naturally, Longfu dismissed his original intention of going to work. At the same time, he didn't want to take his sister to visit the bustling and lively Ginza Avenue. He only followed his sister's will and walked towards Tokyo Station.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the station, there were still more than four hours before departure. After filling their empty stomachs, which had been hungry for a day, in the cafeteria, the two ran to the third-class waiting room to wait for the time to come. The reason why the younger sister waited in the third-class waiting room was that she knew that the martyrs' family members took the second-class train.</p>
<p>At 8 o'clock, the people in the waiting room stood up and went to the door.</p>
<p>(The spirit of a martyr has arrived!)</p>
<p>The crowd of people lowered their heads. People in mourning clothes holding white boxes suddenly appeared. Longfu unconsciously dragged his sister's hand and stood up from his seat. But his hand was stopped by the more powerful hand of his sister.</p>
<p>(Brother! Isn't it the same here?)</p>
<p>The younger sister, standing in a corner of the waiting room, faced the backs of countless people. She put her hands together and bowed. - (End of the book) -</p>

<h3>Red Persimmon Peels Disguised as Crab Roe: Do Not Be Greedy When Purchasing Food</h3>
<p>Recently, some salted crab vendors have appeared on the market, waiting for two days on the road to specialize in confusing buyers. Yesterday, when I was returning from evening school, I met a crab seller who shouted loudly and was cheaper than others. Those who buy crabs think that the crabs are full of red roe, and the price is not too expensive, so they are greedy for small purchases. I walked home, and the villagers all bought some to eat. When they were dissected, they were already rotten and inedible. The roe was replaced with red persimmon peels, resembling crab roe. Persimmons and crabs have opposite properties, which is very important for hygiene. Not only is it a waste of money, but it also harms the human body. I hope buyers will be careful. (Fudong)</p>
<h3>Gospel of Lung Disease</h3>
<p>○ The 4th Lung Disease Clinic: The Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Association and the Chinese Catholic Doctors Association jointly established the 4th Lung Disease Clinic at 197 Yueyang Road (Old Qiqi Road). Since its opening, the clinic has been very busy. The clinic provides free diagnosis and medication at a great cost. The board of directors of the clinic recently decided to raise funds to purchase a new X-ray machine and medical equipment, and to meet the needs of patients, they have hired additional doctors and nurses. Starting today, outpatient services will be added from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., but free patients will still be limited to the morning. ○ Social Association Lung Clinic: Mr. Ding Mocun, Chairman of the Chinese Social Enterprise Association, recognizing that there are many lung disease patients in our country, specially established a lung disease clinic at 700 Nianhao Road, Yuyuan Road, this spring to help poor patients with lung disease. He hired Dr. Weng Zhefu, a lung disease expert, to preside over the clinic. Diagnosis and medication are free of charge. Now that it is autumn, there are many patients and the price of medicine is very high. The clinic continues to provide completely free diagnosis and treatment every day from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., and can provide some medication. I am honored to receive 50 free consultation vouchers, which will be distributed to the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>News from the Yixin Charity Association</h3>
<p>The Yixin Charity Association in Shunyu Lane, Zhajiang Road, Hongkou, was founded by Director Zhao Zhikang. Mr. Wen Chantin was invited to be the honorary director. It has been established for more than two years since it was registered with the Social Welfare Bureau. It provides free diagnosis and medication, and has an obligation school that enrolls more than 100 elementary school students free of charge each semester. The expenses are borne by the directors. Due to the increasing cost of medicine and other expenses, and the planned winter porridge distribution, funds are needed. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide assistance to benefit the poor.</p>
<h3>Postscript on the Zheng Ma Art Exhibition</h3>
<h3>Zheng Shiqiao and Wife's Art Exhibition - Evening Lament</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Shiqiao, a landscape calligrapher from Wulin, has been working hard on his art for thirty years in addition to his political career. Since the Incident, he has been delayed at sea, and has worked harder on calligraphy, so his art has greatly improved. His landscapes are between the styles of Zhong Kui and Lu Tai. His brushstrokes are bold and majestic, which is very different from those who win with delicate flattery. This time, Mr. Zheng and his wife, Ms. Hong Xuxiu, held an art exhibition in Jing'an Temple, with many excellent works. As a result, those who came to visit and order works were crowded.</p>
<p>Mr. Zheng's recent works, such as (Deep and Beautiful Streams and Mountains), are clear, moist, and tranquil. (Misty Water and Geese), elegant and lofty. (Rain Scattered Smoke), the green is clear and bright. (Autumn Mountain), divine and outstanding. (Roaring Canglong), concise to the extreme, using a small amount to surpass many. (Water Embracing Lonely Village), the ink is sparse, but the artistic conception is distant. (Temple Gate Cool Moon Shines, Yun Yun Night Hoof Monk), skillfully uses dry brush rubbing, showing majesty.</p>
<p>His wife, Ms. Hong Renqiu, is extremely strict in landscape painting, following the methods of Lu Tai, peeking into its secrets. Her brushstrokes are condensed and lack feminine weakness. Her ink landscapes, such as (Where to Rewind the Silk) and (Fangwu Autumn Wind), have clear brushstrokes and clean ink. (Spring Sound Choking Dangerous Stone), Xiu Run has no vulgar reading. (Willow Shaded Fishing) (Creek Bridge Cane) and other screens are all neat and objective. (Planting Bamboo Qianyu), the brushstrokes are round and lively, and the distant mountains are smeared, showing great skill. Their sons, Penglu and Honglu's calligraphy, which were attached to the exhibition, are only nine and ten years old, and they already feel extraordinary. The family is elegant, which is truly enviable!</p>
<h3>Ma Shouhua Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Contributed</p>
<p>Those who discuss national calligraphy all say that having a scholarly atmosphere without falling into sweetness is the best, but this is only possible for those who are well-educated and of good character. It is said that those with high character also have high calligraphy, and I believe this even more after the Guan Ma exhibition. Mr. Ma, whose style name is Muxuan, lived in the judiciary for decades and never published his paintings, so many people know him as a lawyer, but few know him as an artist. He is known as a virtuous gentleman in the legal world and has a very high character. The paintings are elegant, beautiful, and moist, without any trace of sweetness. Works such as (New Year's Day Spring Picture), (Luxuriant Forest and Tall Bamboo Picture), and imitating various landscape painters such as Fangshan Shuming Xuanzai, and each family's ink bamboo in Huzhou Songxue Ding, all show his skill and depth of attainments, and can be called masterpieces. It is even more commendable that his finger painting is clear, moist, and beautiful.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Nursing Home Welcomes Visitors from All Walks of Life</h3>
