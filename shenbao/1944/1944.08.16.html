<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">談日本新內閣 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>問：盟邦小　內閣成立以來，一般人認為與東亞大局，並　特殊影響，仍為東條內閣政策之繼承者而已。此徑覜點，是否正確？</p>
<p>答：我國人士，對於日本內閣之史迭，每多種種揣測。這是完全不了解日本之故。日木的國策，自宣戰大詔頒發以來，即無絲毫可議之處，唯求擊滅英美而已。所以說小機內閣為東條內閣政策之機承者，這是對的。然而如果因此誤認小　內閣等於東條內閣，那就非常錯誤子。</p>
<p>問：然則小磯內閣異於東條內閣者是什麽地方？</p>
<p>答：小磯內閣是適應國際戰爭臨於決戰階段，起而担負非常使命的內閣，是要更進一步集結國民總力以爭取最後勝利。所以，首先注重於國民組織之改編。也就是通過所謂「國民的與論化」及「國民政治結集體之一元化」，俾全國國民，在此國家命運決定時期，一致以其忠誠與熱情，在決戰第一綫與將士同樣奮起保術祖國保衛東亞。</p>
<p>問，所謂「強力的舉國的內閣」大概就指此而言吧，不知其具體內容如何？</p>
<p>答：國民組織之再編成，首在實現結成一國一黨的政治組織體，使今日唯一的政治結社—翼政會及「公事結社」—翼贊會，更健全地負起團結政府與民衆的任務，並使全國人民在軍需生產，配給與消費三面編成整個的生活組織體，絕對的滅私奉公，與軍人同樣服從命令，以殉國的道義心，完遂戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>問：這種民衆戰鬥精神之提高與官民團結的最後目標，當然是為了在決戰中取得勝利了，但是精神力固然重要，物質的意義也不能忽視啊！</p>
<p>答：正因為日木常面的敵人是以物質主義誇傲於世界的，所以，小磯內閣的第二個使命就在統帥與國務完全的一致上，傾注令力於昂揚戰意，增強生產，特別注力於重點生產之強化，兵器生產行政之綜合一元化。具體的方策，就是軍需省的改革，山軍，官，民三者問一致的協力，確立與政戰兩路一致的決戰生產體制，使軍需省不僅為飛機生產省，而是飛機，艦船，陸上兵器生產的綜合增產省。同時確立模範工塲制，實行生產指導，並依動勞統帥組織，確立動勞管理制度，貫澈產業要員制度及技術者動員體制，以期及早完成所謂必勝生產對策。</p>
<p>問：所謂軍，官，民一致的必勝生產對策的內容，固如尊見，但是要求貫澈，似乎還是一個內政問題吧？</p>
<p>答：不錯，所以小　內閣的第三個使命就是澈底革新內政。現在日本內政問題，就在適應作戰上之要求，以飛機增產為中心，確保主要食糧，資材，’勞務，運輸等之增產，因而對國內一切機構及人才，實行非常動員，而這一切，又有待於政府之堅強的政治力，俾能澈底實現各種重要政策。因此，一方面須致力於中央政治之澈底革新，以大達新任內務大臣為中心，與軍·厚生·農商·交通·文部各省及情報局協同努力，為求勞務·生產·交通·通訊·宣傳·食糧·厚生及一般國民方面，施行國民總武裝的配置，實行內政之本質的革新。</p>
<p>問：中央政治之革新既如此，地方行政又如何？</p>
<p>答：關於日木地方行政制度，近年來迭有改進。共中最重要的是地方行政協議會，原為連絡官民及地方與中央之強力的戰時機構。日本在一年來會　力擴充地方行政權限，尤其是經濟統制·礦山·營林·海運等逐漸移歸地方管理，新內閣除維持此種新制以外，並將進一步確立「道州制的廣城行政　」，強化地方協議會之事權，強化地方行政機構，以便一面密切政府與人民的聯繫，一面使地方與中央一致涮新行政，使生產事業，經濟統制與防空及國土防術等事業，都能依照理想推進，共同爭取決戰的最後勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日八十五屆議會　定下月五日召集　政府將闡明完遂戰爭的决心 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社施電　日內閣設置最高戰爭指導會議，策定決戰施策之最高指導方針，茲爲適應現戰局之急需，籌劃完全之政略戰略，更奏請召集第八十五屆戰時議會，藉使國民澈底認識戰局，完遂戰爭，強化政府等決意，且將決戰下政府之施政方針，及一億國民向決勝之途邁進決心，昭示內外。小磯首相于十五日定例閣議席上，決定下月五日，舉行臨時議會，閣僚間先行交換意見，進行各方準備。小磯首相，于同日下午二時，奏呈該事，至提出法案等尚未決定。小磯內閣成立以來，尚屬初次舉行臨時議會，屆時除首相演說施政方針外，重光外相，將演說外交方針，杉山睦相·米內海相·亦將報告最近戰况，藉使國民明瞭政府之決意。此外，關於飛機增產，食糧對策等關係法案，亦豫定隨時局之進展，採取非常措置。</p>

<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　密芝那方面美國密林部隊發生叛亂事件，頗惹美國與論注意，據美陸軍當局十三日發表，該事件之發生，乃由於不能履行無準備不可能之諾言所致，並未言及叛亂之實情，陸長史汀生，亦未作更詳細之說明，由此可想見，今後此問題必更有相當糾紛。緣有所謂放浪部隊之特別志展兵所組成之審林部隊，在密芝那區作戰激烈時，曾令傷兵赴陣作戰，擬完成升級之野心，在激戰終了後，應將彼等送還本國，但未會履行諾言，乃至出此不穩行為。</p>

<p>日軍前綫某基地十五日中央社電　日軍攻佔衝陽後，即對企圖克復衡陽反攻前來之渝軍，施行掃蕩，並準備第二期作戰，渝軍連日經日軍猛擎，受創甚重，自十四日以來，衡陽西方及西南方地區，戰事已經停頓，刻正構築陣地中。</p>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電　美聯社重慶特派員十四日報稱：渝軍喪失衡陽後，仍以奪回該市為目標，刻正於衡陽郊外周圍地區激戰中，日軍會數度攻擊渝軍，更於衡陽南方反復展開強襲。日軍另一部隊，於耒陽西北二十九公里之地點渡過湘江，攻擊企圖自西南方進攻衡陽方面之渝軍背後，展開掃蕩作戰。又日軍曾攻擊洲鄉西北渝軍各陣地。</p>
<p>敵美反攻妄想粉碎</p>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日軍自五月二十七日在湖北省發動作戰以來，至今已七十餘日，其間價在渝美聯軍之戰略中心點湖南境內，展開機動戰。自攻克長沙·衡陽二大據點後，使渝美軍之戰略根本失敗，日大本營十四日發表，日軍在此次作戰中，予渝美軍人力·物力上之損害，數量極其龐大。此次作戰，已使敵美作中國大陸對日反攻之妄想粉碎無餘，戰略上之重大意義，實在於此，蓋敵美企圖一向在驅策渝軍發動對日攻勢，並與駐渝美空軍合作，由東西兩方面來擊日軍，此種企圖，已因為敵奚所　弄，在日軍之前，不斷蠢動，致在軍事受實大打擊，其情形實至可悲　。渝方於日軍自加達卡納爾撤退以來，即對日方估價過低，並認日木已無力對華作戰，今春河南戰役之後，又有湖南之戰，然渝軍並未放棄抗戰速夢，不信日軍尚能進攻衡陽，其作戰指導，始終數衍，一旦接觸日軍強大戰力，當即陷入不可收拾地步，徒然增加損失。如日大本營十四日所發表，在中國東南地區，薛岳所部三十師裝備最佳軍隊，業被日軍擊潰，再第一戰區湯恩伯軍已歸消減，使渝方抗戰陣營陷入絕境，除在經濟方面，喪失湖南　倉外，稅收約減少一成，鐵路及河運喪失後，即無從利用江西之米及粵渶之物資，重慶地區食糧，必將漸感不足。又大陸戰綫長衆，頗敬慕日軍軍紀嚴千，紛紛歸來，一　準備完畢，發動次期作戰時，渝方之苦惱，必將更加深切。</p>

<p>袁財局長報告</p>
<p>繼由袁局長報吿本市財政三年來收支　況，內容分爲十項。茲誌其原文如下：</p>
<p>確有調查　員敲詐事</p>
<p>致林哲夫先生的信刲是前工部局奮物。　聽說送到報館亦是用的區公署送信薄大概也是舊物。　科之組織，雖尙未遵照市府組織法改正，但內部並不完全用以前名稱，多半用第幾組，信上說的SectionA—E是一班西藉職員　口呌出的，現在自辭退四十餘西藉職員後科內早已不聽見有SectionA—E等稱。　因納稅人舞弊，調查員靈機敲詐的事是有的，但並不是犬天有，家家有，隨時發覺隨即　辦，現尙有二人正拘捕在警局。　敲詐的數目，最大的是這一次，據報有十萬元，平日無此巨欵，有時　數百至數千。</p>
<p>另收酬金　公開秘密</p>
<p>商人黑市買賣，照市價記賬徵稅，調查員以技術債查其舞弊實在數目，報告酌定罰款後，在從中另取一筆酬金。這酬金是調查員等公開的秘密，大概信上說三七分配，或許是這筆，這種只有調查員及其關係人參加，科長不管，因爲如果干涉，必要　適歸公，他們救不用氣力去調查，不願白白得罪商人，反使公家少取。譬如查的其舞弊實數爲十萬，處罰二十萬，他們再加若千酬勞，如不許另索酬金，他們不用嚴密方法去偵查，只能得到舞弊五萬的證據。罰款歸公，不過十萬，反少十萬，這種事的例子尙多，不過略舉一種。</p>
<p>用盡方法　不能取締</p>
<p>這類索酬金的惡習，用盡方法現尙不能取締。本想由公家印製發粟，因爲成本太大，且有多數商店不用發票，向無此類人員　寫。現在正在硏究如何可以有嚴密的制度，不使商人偸漏稅款，他們這班調查員，就無法素酬事。警如四大公司各大綢莊等，有沒敵詐呢？是絕對沒有的。　南市等處的營業稅等，是一樣的，因爲一個收說機關，至少廿人，因爲納說人總不自繳，總耍上門去收，一次還收不到，用人多，每人生活總在薪水以外要　補才能生存的，這彌補的就是公家的損失。</p>
<p>納稅人應　有公德心</p>
<p>其他不必　述，總之制度與收稅員的程度，都是要緊，納稅人的公德心更要緊。如何訓練是我們的責任，人民程度是不易的，制度要硏究的，如何訓練，盼大家隨時指教，發表高見，自應接受，秉承市長的命令，裁奪施行。　四萬萬的數字經辦人員並不重視，都以爲決無此事，都甚坦白。但主管者總不能不負責任，所以先將科長調開別科，靜候上峰查辦，將來眞相明瞭，如稍有弊病，當即重懲，決不寬貸。倘無此事，他們決不願受此不白之寃的。　消費稅自二月開辦至今，共收七萬萬六千餘萬，繳財部約近四萬萬，每月均逐步增加</p>
<h3 id="c23">故張部長追悼會　各方致踴躍　集款移助敎育社會事業 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>

<p>一月以前，本報陳社長曾與警察局盧副局長楚僧談及助學運動之迫切，助學金之靈要，盧副局長極表同情，陳社長即面請募集，現日募得三百萬元，是爲個人經募數目最高　錄·本報助學金同人墍受助學生深致謝忱。盧氏服務本市警政有年，畏警局亦已六年，素以軍隊化管理警察，勇於負責，辦事公正。本年八月一日警政一元化，盧氏改任警察局副局長，負責郊區警政，郊試警政對於全市治安關係密切，因此，市政常局曁市民對於盧氏深致期待·盧氏曾面向本報陳社長表示，極願聽取並接受市民對於警政改進之意見。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding the New Japanese Cabinet <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Question: Since the establishment of the Koiso cabinet, general opinion holds that it will not have a particularly special impact on the overall situation in East Asia and is merely a successor to the policies of the Tojo cabinet. Is this viewpoint correct?</p>
<p>Answer: Our countrymen often engage in various speculations regarding the changes in the Japanese cabinet. This stems from a complete lack of understanding of Japan. Since the issuance of the declaration of war, there has been no room for discussion of Japan's national policy; it has been solely focused on defeating Britain and America. Therefore, it is correct to say that the Koiso cabinet is a successor to the policies of the Tojo cabinet. However, it would be a grave error to mistakenly believe that the Koiso cabinet is identical to the Tojo cabinet.</p>
<p>Question: In what ways, then, does the Koiso cabinet differ from the Tojo cabinet?</p>
<p>Answer: The Koiso cabinet is a cabinet that has risen to undertake an extraordinary mission, adapting to the international war entering a decisive stage. It seeks to further mobilize the nation's total strength to achieve final victory. Therefore, it first emphasizes the reorganization of national organizations, namely, through the so-called "national consensus formation" and "unification of national political entities," so that all citizens, during this time of national destiny, can unanimously rise up with their loyalty and enthusiasm, on the front lines of the decisive battle, alongside the soldiers, to protect the motherland and defend East Asia.</p>
<p>Question: The so-called "powerful national cabinet" probably refers to this, but what are its specific contents?</p>
<p>Answer: The reorganization of national organizations begins with realizing a political organization of one country, one party, so that the only existing political association—the Imperial Rule Assistance Association (翼政會)—and the "public service association"—the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society (翼贊會)—can more effectively assume the task of uniting the government and the people. It also involves organizing the entire lives of the people in the three areas of military production, distribution, and consumption, absolutely subordinating private interests to public duty, obeying orders like soldiers, and completing the victory of the war with a spirit of martyrdom.</p>
<p>Question: The ultimate goal of enhancing this popular fighting spirit and unifying the government and the people is, of course, to achieve victory in the decisive battle. But while spiritual strength is important, the significance of material resources cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>Answer: Precisely because Japan's current enemies boast of materialism to the world, the second mission of the Koiso cabinet is to concentrate its power on uplifting fighting spirit and increasing production through complete unity between command and state affairs, especially focusing on strengthening key production and unifying the administration of weapons production. The concrete strategy is to reform the Ministry of Munitions, achieve consistent cooperation among the military, government, and people, and establish a decisive production system that unifies both political and war efforts, making the Ministry of Munitions not only a ministry for aircraft production but a comprehensive ministry for increasing the production of aircraft, warships, and land weapons. At the same time, it will establish a model factory system, implement production guidance, and, based on a labor command organization, establish a labor management system, implement a key industry personnel system, and mobilize technicians, aiming to complete the so-called "sure-win production strategy" as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Question: The content of the so-called "sure-win production strategy" that unites the military, government, and people is as you describe, but demanding its thorough implementation seems to be an internal affairs issue.</p>
<p>Answer: That's right. Therefore, the third mission of the Koiso cabinet is to thoroughly reform domestic administration. The current internal affairs issues in Japan involve adapting to the demands of warfare, focusing on increasing aircraft production, ensuring the increased production of major food supplies, materials, labor, and transportation, and thus carrying out an extraordinary mobilization of all domestic institutions and talent. All of this depends on the government's strong political power to thoroughly implement various important policies. Therefore, on the one hand, efforts must be devoted to thoroughly reforming central politics, with the newly appointed Minister of Home Affairs as the core, working in collaboration with the ministries of the military, health, agriculture and commerce, transportation, education, and the Information Bureau to implement national comprehensive armament arrangements in the areas of labor, production, transportation, communication, propaganda, food, health, and the general public, thereby realizing a fundamental reform of domestic administration.</p>
<p>Question: If the reform of central politics is like this, what about local administration?</p>
<p>Answer: Regarding Japan's local administrative system, there have been repeated improvements in recent years. Among the most important is the Local Administrative Council, originally a strong wartime organization connecting officials and civilians, as well as local and central governments. In the past year, Japan has vigorously expanded the authority of local administration, especially with economic controls, mining, forestry, and maritime transport gradually being transferred to local management. In addition to maintaining this new system, the new cabinet will further establish a "道州制 (Dōshū-sei, regional administrative division system) broad-area administration," strengthen the authority of the Local Council, and strengthen local administrative organizations in order to closely connect the government with the people and to enable local areas to work with the central government to refresh administration, so that production enterprises, economic controls, air defense, and national defense projects can all be promoted according to ideals, jointly striving for the final victory of the decisive battle.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The mutiny of the American jungle warfare unit in the vicinity of Myitkyina has attracted considerable attention in American public opinion. According to the American Army authorities' announcement on the 13th, the incident occurred due to the failure to fulfill promises that could not be fulfilled without preparation, and did not mention the actual situation of the mutiny. Secretary of War Stimson also did not provide a more detailed explanation, which suggests that this issue will inevitably cause considerable disputes in the future. The jungle warfare unit, which is composed of special volunteers from the so-called "vagabond unit," was ordered to send wounded soldiers to the battlefront during the intense fighting in the Myitkyina area, with the intention of completing their promotion. After the fierce fighting ended, they were supposed to be sent back to their home country, but the promise was not fulfilled, leading to this unstable behavior.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Mr. Iwami Ryohachi of Sakae-machi, Karafuto, Japan, has previously extracted lubricating oil (industrial motive power) from the fat of marine animals. After years of research by Mr. Morishita Morizo and others, this research has now achieved complete success. Traditionally, lubricating oil has been made mainly from fish oil. In recent years, attention has gradually been paid to the study of sea animal oil, a resource unique to Karafuto. Under the guidance of Professor Oka of Tokyo Agricultural College, a test was first conducted by extracting it from seal fat, and the results were quite good. In the future, this will be used as a formal oil production enterprise. In addition, the livers, blood, etc. of these marine animals can also be used as pharmaceuticals, so research is currently being conducted on how to make them into basic pharmaceutical agents.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Japanese Forces Launch a Sweeping Operation Against Areas Surrounding Hengyang and Attack Chinese Positions Northwest of Xiangxiang <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the front lines, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Japanese army occupied Chongyang, they carried out a sweeping operation against the Chinese army that attempted to recapture Hengyang and launched a counterattack, and prepared for the second phase of operations. The Chinese army suffered heavy damage due to the fierce fighting of the Japanese army for days. Since the 14th, the fighting in the western and southwestern areas of Hengyang has stopped, and they are currently constructing positions.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - An Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing reported on the 14th that after losing Hengyang, the Chinese army still aimed to retake the city and was currently engaged in fierce fighting in the surrounding areas of Hengyang. The Japanese army attacked the Chinese army several times and repeatedly launched strong assaults south of Hengyang. Another unit of the Japanese army crossed the Xiang River at a location 29 kilometers northwest of Leiyang, attacking the rear of the Chinese army that was attempting to attack Hengyang from the southwest, and launched a sweeping operation. In addition, the Japanese army attacked various Chinese positions northwest of Zhuxiang.</p>
<p>Enemy American Counter-Offensive Wishful Thinking Shattered</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the Japanese army launched operations in Hubei Province on May 27, it has been more than 70 days, during which it launched mobile warfare within the Hunan Province, the strategic center point of the Chinese-American Allied forces, After capturing the two major strongholds of Changsha and Hengyang, the strategic failure of the Chinese-American forces was fundamentally defeated. The Japanese General Headquarters announced on the 14th that the damage to the manpower and material resources of the Chinese-American forces during this operation was extremely large. This operation has shattered the enemy's American wishful thinking of launching a counter-offensive against Japan on the Chinese mainland. The great strategic significance lies in this. The enemy has always been trying to drive the Chinese army to launch an offensive against Japan and cooperate with the American air force stationed in China to attack the Japanese army from the east and west. This attempt has already been frustrated by the enemy. Before the Japanese army, it continued to stir up trouble, resulting in a heavy military blow. The situation is truly pitiful. Since the Japanese army withdrew from Guadalcanal, the Chinese side has underestimated the Japanese side and believed that Japan is no longer able to fight against China. After the Henan campaign this spring, there was the war in Hunan, but the Chinese army did not give up its dream of a quick victory, and did not believe that the Japanese army could still attack Hengyang. Its combat guidance was always slow, and once it came into contact with the strong combat power of the Japanese army, it immediately fell into an unrecoverable situation, only increasing losses. As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 14th, in the southeastern region of China, Xue Yue's 30 divisions of the best-equipped troops were defeated by the Japanese army, and the First War Zone of Tang Enbo's army has been wiped out, putting the Chinese side's resistance camp in a desperate situation. In addition to losing the Hunan granary in terms of economy, tax revenue has decreased by about 10%. After losing the railways and river transport, there is no way to use the rice from Jiangxi and the materials from Guangdong and Hubei. Food in the Chongqing area will gradually become insufficient. In addition, the continental war line is long and many admire the strict military discipline of the Japanese army and return one after another. Once preparations are completed and the next phase of operations is launched, the Chinese side's suffering will inevitably deepen.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Heavily Attack Liuzhou and Liangshan</p>
<p>A certain base on the mainland, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese bomber squadron attacked Liuzhou again at dawn on the 13th, destroying 22 Chinese planes of various sizes.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Soviet army began an offensive northwest of Bialystok, Poland, and reached the southeastern border of East Prussia on the 14th. The German forces that withdrew from the city of Osowiec launched fierce mechanized battles in the marshy area northwest of the city. A separate Soviet detachment approached Lomza, a strategic point west of Bialystok, on the 14th. The battle for the capture of the East Prussian border is currently extremely tense. The German military authorities officially stated on the 14th that the Soviet army's operations in the Osowiec area are extremely important. When the Soviet army reorganized its attack on East Prussia, it revealed its intention to launch a major offensive in that direction. The pressure on East Prussia from the two offensives mentioned above will be further intensified in the future. The German army has now concentrated reserve forces and a large number of weapons to prepare for a decisive battle, and an unprecedented major field battle will soon begin.</p>

The German army continued to mop up the guerrillas in the city of Warsaw. Their isolated teams attempted to escape to the forest area north of Warsaw, but were quickly pursued and annihilated by the German armored units.</p>

<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuters: The anti-Axis forces failed to encircle the German forces in Normandy over the weekend. The American Third Army built a 250-kilometer defense line along the lower Loire River and the Oise River to protect the troops attacking Argentan and Alençon. A large number of troops are needed to defend this defense line. General Patton does not have enough troops, and the pincers have not been joined. However, the American army still maintains pressure on Argentan and Falaise. The German reserves are engaged in fierce fighting against General Patton's tank forces. The German forces in Normandy are gradually moving away from the protruding positions, and the rearguard units are engaged in fierce fighting with the American First Army. The British Second Army is increasing pressure on the area of Norol, apparently to disrupt the German forces' withdrawal. The Canadian First Army advanced several kilometers between the Orne River and the Laize River. There has been no change in the battle situation from north of Falaise to the Caen-Troarn road. The Canadian strategy seems to be to launch a major offensive. In Brittany, the American army's attacks on Saint-Malo and Dinard have not yet succeeded. The anti-Axis forces' attacks on Brest and Lorient have slowed down. On the Saint-Nazaire front, the American army withdrew from the outer positions. The army apparently intends to attack Saint-Malo and Dinard first, and then attack other places.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Truth of the Embezzlement Case of Former Staff of the First District Special Tax Office; Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau Reports on the Handling Process <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the embezzlement case of the former staff of the First District Public Office Special Tax Office, all sectors of society have paid close attention. After liaison between the Publicity Department and the Finance Bureau, a discussion meeting was held with reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) at Room 140, Jiangxi Road, Municipal Government. Director Yuan Houzhi of the Finance Bureau personally attended to report on the contents of the case and the handling process in great detail. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM sharp, more than 30 reporters from various newspapers gathered one after another. Liang Xiuyu, Director of the Municipal Publicity Department, Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, and Councilor Lin Zhefu also arrived on time. Director Liang first reported on the significance of the reception, stating: "Recently, the embezzlement case of the former staff of the First District Public Office Special Tax Office has attracted great attention from all sectors of society, and the public opinion has also continuously expressed opinions, hoping that the municipal authorities will thoroughly investigate the truth of the case. Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau has paid great attention to this and has also made two statements. Today, we are specially inviting you to have Director Yuan give a detailed report on the correct content of the case and the handling process."</p>
<p>Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau Reports</p>
<p>Director Yuan then reported on the revenue and expenditure of the city's finances over the past three years, with the content divided into ten items. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>There Are Indeed Cases of Investigators Extorting Money</p>
<p>The letter to Mr. Lin Zhefu is an old item from the former Municipal Council. It is said that the delivery to the newspaper office also used the district office's delivery slip, which was probably also an old item. Although the organization of the sections has not yet been revised in accordance with the municipal government's organizational law, the internal structure does not completely use the previous names, mostly using Section Number. The Section A-E mentioned in the letter was what a group of Western staff members used to call them. Since the resignation of more than 40 Western staff members, the names Section A-E have long been unheard of within the sections. There are indeed cases of investigators extorting money from taxpayers who are cheating, but it does not happen every day or in every household. Whenever it is discovered, it is immediately dealt with. There are currently two people detained in the police station. The largest amount of extortion was this time, reported to be 100,000 yuan. Usually, there are no such large amounts, sometimes several hundred to several thousand.</p>
<p>Openly Receiving Rewards is an Open Secret</p>
<p>Merchants buy and sell on the black market and record their accounts at market prices for tax purposes. Investigators use their technical skills to investigate the actual amount of cheating, report it, and determine the amount of the fine, and then take a reward from it. This reward is an open secret among the investigators. The letter probably refers to this when it says that the investigators get 30% and give 70%. This only involves the investigators and their associates, and the section chief does not care, because if they interfere, it is necessary to turn the entire reward over to the government. They do not have to put in the effort to investigate, and they do not want to offend the merchants for nothing, which would reduce the government's revenue. For example, if the actual amount of cheating is found to be 100,000, and the penalty is 200,000, they will add a certain amount of reward. If they are not allowed to solicit rewards, they will not use strict methods to investigate, and they can only obtain evidence of 50,000 yuan in cheating. The fine turned over to the government is only 100,000, which is 100,000 less. There are many examples of this kind of thing, but I will just mention one.</p>
<p>Exhausting All Methods Cannot Eliminate It</p>
<p>It has been impossible to eliminate this kind of bad habit of soliciting rewards even after exhausting all methods. We originally wanted the government to print and issue receipts, but the cost is too high, and most stores do not use receipts, and there are no such personnel to write them. We are now studying how to have a strict system that prevents merchants from evading taxes, so that these investigators will have no way to collect rewards. Are large companies and silk stores cheating? Absolutely not. The business tax in Nanshi and other places is the same, because a collection agency needs at least 20 people, because taxpayers never pay on their own, and they always have to go to their door to collect, and they can't collect it at once. There are many people, and everyone has to supplement their income in addition to their salary to survive. This supplement is the government's loss.</p>
<p>Taxpayers Should Have Civic Virtue</p>
<p>There is no need to elaborate on the rest. In short, the system and the level of the tax collectors are important, and the civic virtue of the taxpayers is even more important. How to train them is our responsibility. The level of the people is not easy to change, and the system needs to be studied. How to train them, I hope everyone will give us guidance and express their opinions at any time. We should accept them and implement them in accordance with the Mayor's orders. The staff handling the 400 million number do not take it seriously and think that this is definitely not the case and are very frank. However, the person in charge cannot but take responsibility, so he first transferred the section chief to another section, waiting for the higher authorities to investigate. If the truth is revealed in the future and there is any malpractice, it will be severely punished and there will be no leniency. If this is not the case, they will definitely not want to suffer this injustice. Since the consumption tax was launched in February, it has collected a total of 760 million yuan, and nearly 400 million yuan has been turned over to the Ministry of Finance, and it is increasing month by month.</p>

<p>The memorial service for the late Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yunbo, initiated by various sectors and groups in the city, is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM on the 18th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Tianhou Palace Bridge. For this memorial service, all condolence gifts will be converted into cash, so that the collected amount can be used to set up scholarships and social welfare undertakings, in line with Zhang's lifelong dedication to self-discipline and his enthusiasm for social welfare.

In addition, anyone who wishes to express their respect for Zhang, whether as a group or individual, is welcome to participate freely. However, schools and groups with large numbers of people can contact the preparatory office for the memorial service at 160 Da Shanghai Road, 3rd floor, in advance. The memorial service will be simple and solemn, and Mr. Wen Lanting has been appointed as the chief mourner, with Li Sihao, Yuan Lüdeng, Lin Kanghou, and Pei Yunqing as the assisting mourners. At that time, Liang Hongzhi, President of the Control Yuan, Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, Chen Enpu, Minister of Judicial Administration, and other central government officials will also make a special trip to Shanghai to participate in the memorial service.</p>
<p>Readers' Scholarship News</p>
<h3 id="e24">Anonymous Individuals Donate Generously; 3 Million Yuan; Deputy Director Lu Sets Highest Fundraising Record <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>A month ago, Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, talked to Deputy Director Lu Chuseng of the Police Bureau about the urgency of the scholarship movement and the importance of scholarship funds. Deputy Director Lu expressed his sympathy, and Mr. Chen immediately requested donations. Now, 3 million yuan has been raised, setting the highest fundraising record for an individual. The staff of this newspaper's scholarship fund and the students who will be helped express their deep gratitude. Lu has served in the city's police force for many years, including six years as the head of the police station. He is known for managing the police in a military style, being courageous in taking responsibility, and being fair in his work. On August 1st of this year, when the police administration was unified, Lu was reassigned as the Deputy Director of the Police Bureau, responsible for the suburban police administration. Suburban police administration is closely related to the city's public security. Therefore, the Municipal Government and the citizens have high expectations for Lu. Lu once told Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, that he is very willing to listen to and accept the citizens' opinions on improving the police administration.</p>

<p>Yesterday, an anonymous donor generously donated 30,000 yuan, Nanyang Caolu generously donated 20,000 yuan, and the Zhi De Tang Zhang generously donated 10,000 yuan. This moment of kindness is truly admirable. In addition, the Hu Gongting Memorial Scholarship Fund Management Committee sent a letter requesting the selection of five junior high school students. Qiu Xiaoshi wrote: "The gentlemen of Shen Bao have worked hard to organize scholarships for poor students. I often hear my father talk about it and I sympathize with them very much. I will use 10,000 yuan of my usual savings to support the scholarship fund, hoping that other children will also come to support..." This kindness is truly commendable. The donations received yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Construction abolished the management of railway police and stipulated that railway police affairs be transferred to the local police for management, the Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau received an order and immediately sent Lin Ji, Director of the General Affairs Department, Nakano, Deputy Director, and Sun Shishan, Director of the West Hongkou Branch Bureau, and Ohashi, Deputy Director, to the Shanghai Section Headquarters of the Railway Police on Zhujiang Road at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 15th) to formally take over.

<h3 id="e27">Health Bureau Intensifies Second Phase of Epidemic Prevention Injections <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>After the Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee decided to start the second phase of epidemic prevention injections on August 1st, the Health Bureau launched the work as scheduled and dispatched personnel to various traffic arteries to carry out injections. As of now, more than 200,000 people have been injected. Recently, due to the merger of the Health Bureau and the First District Health Office, the command of epidemic prevention workers has been unified, and the progress has become smoother. Cholera injections must be administered in two phases to be effective. Those who received the first phase in May and June should receive the second phase in August. Those who received the first phase in July can postpone the second phase until September. The general public often waits and sees regarding epidemic prevention injections because the weather is turning cooler, but they do not know that cholera is most likely to occur between summer and autumn, which is still a dangerous period, and slight negligence cannot be tolerated. In addition to ordering its subordinates to intensify their work, the Health Bureau hopes that the public will take the initiative to go for injections and not avoid them, so as to ensure safety.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Advisory Committee Investigates Vacant Factories and Houses Throughout the City <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>

After receiving the order, the Nanshi neighborhood offices have been conducting investigations separately in order to report them by a certain date.</p>

<p>It has been understood by the general public that the use of flashlights is prohibited after an air raid alarm is issued in order to avoid light leakage. However, members of the Self-Defense Corps and air defense personnel are using them arbitrarily on top of observation posts and other high-rise buildings, and some are even shining flashlights upwards to signal to turn off the lights at high places, which violates air defense prohibitions. It is reported that the Baojia Office has issued strict orders to prohibit this in order to implement light control, and it is hoped that citizens will also pay close attention and comply with it together.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Do Not Touch Air Defense Obstruction Bombs <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Air defense obstruction bombs have unparalleled power, and the explosive force is extremely thick. Once used and landed on the ground, citizens must not touch them without authorization to avoid accidents. They should report to the nearby military police immediately.
