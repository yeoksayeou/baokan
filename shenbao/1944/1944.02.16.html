<h3>內部擬具禁烟案　行政院昨日通過　國府決定三年內禁絕毒品</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電本日行政院開一九六次例會，茲摘錄嬰案如左：　內政部梅部長擬具禁烟辦法大　草案，央議通過，並呈國防會議，核准後公布施行，</p>
<p>新國民運動促進委員會擬且禁烟禁毒計訓，木案决議交內政部參考，　衛生署陸署長呈送修正麻醉藥員（醫藥用及科學用之麻醉品）管理草案，决議審查意見修正通過，並呈中政會，木案與禁烟計劃並行推進，，亦為淸毒辦法之一，　農業場產策進委員會　兼委員長呈送各省市農業增產策進委員會組織通則草案，决議通過。　江西省政府改組，財，政，建三廳蟬聯，政務應長由劉靈繼任。</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電鴉片貽害中國已逾百年，其毒甚於洪水猛獸，中國之積弱，寶由於烟毒之深入民問，致國弱民貧。民國二十四年汪主席在行政院長任內，鑒於烟毒不除，實有亡國減種之憂，乃以最大决心嚴密程序頒佈五年禁烟計劃，不幸因事變發生，致禁烟工作，陷於俘頓。茲政府當局為　續完成禁烟計劇，期恢復民族健康，培餐國家元氣，以貢戲於與華保亞之大業，其禁烟辦法大綱，業由內政部擬就，呈送行政院，於行政院一九六次例會通過，並呈國防會議核後公布施行，其計劃以三年為期，完全禁絕鴉片及一切毒品，期間縮短，辦法嚴密，國內之烟毒，於此三年內定可一掃而淸，內政部梅部長，靑少年國林總監，均為此事發表剴切談話，說明政府禁毒决意，同時日駐華大使館當局亦發表談話，表明協力國民政府禁烟禁毒政策之進行，並告戒日僑深自戒庸，加強協力推進其烟政策。</p>
<p>禁烟办法要点</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電內政部梅部長談關於禁烟辦法要點如：　三年禁絕鴉片。廿四年汪主席在行政院院長任內，厲行禁烟訂有「禁烟實施辦法」，於是年四月十八日公佈，規定自廿五年起至廿九年止限期五年，禁絕鴉片。旋因事變，於廿六年中止施行。茲繼續前項政策，規定自卅三年三月三十日起，至卅六年三月廿九日止，限期三年，禁絕鴉片。　絕對禁止種烟。厲行烟禁，當以禁種為前提，烟種來源既絕，禁運禁吸自易收效。且種植　栗不特為烟毒之根源，並妨害正當農產際此獎勵增產之時尤有禁絕必要，故在和平區內，嚴厲禁止種烟。　實施烟民登記。凡染有嗜好尚未戒除之烟民，一律施行登記，依照三年限期嚴令，分期根絕。　普設戒烟醫院。中央及各主要都市，普設戒烟醫院，以積極的設備強制登記。烟民按期投戒，去除不良嗜好。　毒氛立即掃除。白面紅丸等毒品，為害尤甚於鴉片，立即嚴厲禁絕。不論製毒販毒吸毒，一概絕對禁止，達者從嚴治罪。</p>
<h3>林部長廣播</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電宜傳部林部長以日軍佔領新加坡兩週年紀念及政府通過禁烟辦法，特於舟昨十五日晚在中央電台舉行廣播，題為「淸毒禁烟與擊減英美」，闡述淸毒禁烟與擊減英美兩事實為一事，欲激底擊減英美，必須淸毒禁烟，欲澈底淸毒禁烟，亦必須擎減英美云云。</p>
<h3>日大使館　發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電日木駐華大使館當局談話，木月十五日國民政府行政院會議通過禁烟禁毒計劃大綱，以三年為期，斷然禁絕鴉片及一切毒品，動員全國人力物力，謀巾國之復與，達成保衛東亞之傽大使命，乃國民政府當局門爭精神之表現，誠不勝敬佩之至。</p>
<p>溯自東印度公司開始秘密貿易以來，鴉片給予中國之畫害，殊令人昨舌。自林則徐焚燒鴉片二萬箱以來，於今一百零五年，適值英國侵略東亞根據地陷落兩週年紀念之日，國民政府揭起禁烟大　，回顫前事，殊令人感念萬分。</p>
<p>帝國政府關於禁烟政策之實行，於　灣曾有經騐，對於滿洲國戒烟政策，亦曾予以種種技術上之援助，封於國民政府今後禁烟標毒政策之推行，如有須協助之處，當不惜予以一切之協力。</p>
<p>帝國政府關於鴉片及」切毒品，對在華日僑會夙予嚴令取締。除依刑法處理之外，並特別制定以中華民國麻醉品等取締法令及施行細則，嚴林麻醉品及生鴉片之製造搬運與保存。惟經長年戰亂，雖經領事館當局嚴令取締，仍不免有逃避法網故作不法行為者誠不勝遣恨之至。當茲國民政府決定　施戒烟政策之日，对於此種不法行為，自常依法予以斷然之處罰。所望在華日僑對時局之重大性，深切認識，中日協力批進禁烟政策，徜有藉治外法機之名，有不軌之嫌，實對日本帝國邁進大東亞戰爭之歷史，留下最大之汚點，不能不深自戒肅者也。</p>
<h3>大東亞民族會議　意義重大</h3>
<p>北京十五日中央社電大東亞民族會議，預定六月左右在東京舉行。華北新民會彭事務總長頃就此事發表談話，謂去年十一月舉行之大東亞會議，及繼此舉行之興亞團體首腦會議，係澈底向各民族闡明日本建設大東亞共榮圈之廣大意圖，同時大東亞十億民於間協力戰爭之熱心，益為奮發。大東亞宣言，係闡明大東亞十億民族共通所有之崇高理想者，為期其實施起見，各民族各國家如不展開強力之國民運動，或民族運動，則大東亞之宣書亦從為具文，而大東亞民族會議之舉行，取適時宜。</p>
<h3>日軍在布其頓　展開殲滅戰　敵退路截斷陷大混亂</h3>
<p>仰光十五日中央社電據緬甸日軍前綫某基地電：日軍精銳各部隊於布其頓西北某地，刻正縮小包國綫，英軍第七師大部隊約有數萬之衆，擁有坦克車若干輛，自動卡重數百輛，由空中投下食糧，勉力補充食糧彈藥，雖企突圖破日軍之包團錢，然毫無希望，從待殲滅而已。敵軍已無法挽回頹勢，喪失退路而大陷混亂，敵師團司令都幹部似由某地捨　部下軍隊乘飛機逃出。又日軍開始進攻時，馬猶山脈之敵軍部隊企圖由納夫河逃往納夫　頭某方面，此項軍隊亦遭日機猛攻，被殲於納夫河底，日軍空陸呼應，在布其頓展開殲減戰，現己至最後階級。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電印度國民軍協力日軍作戰，活　彊場，使敵方之印度軍極受衝動，前來投降日軍之印度兵日有數百人。故英印軍之軍心已發生動搖，蔓延及全軍，阿拉坎可謂印度人總奮起之發火點也。</p>
<h3>日機襲平南</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電據重熒來電，日軍機隊曾於十三日轟炸　西省東部浔江北岸之平南云。</p>
<h3>新幾內亞附近　日機襲敵船</h3>
<p>東京十五日中央社電據南太平洋日軍前錢某基地電，日海軍機隊於十四日鑿明襲擊新不列顛及新幾內亞各地所獲戰果，計於新不列　島克列泰角炸中敵運轍船一艘，又於新几內亞烏芬希哈罕南方之貝尼西埠頭附近，炸毀敵驅遂艦一艘，於新不列顯島波爾根灣重創敵大型運輸船一艘，此外更襲擊敵阿羅埃島及次爾布之敵靈陣地，以上各役日織均無損失，全機安返原防</p>
<h3>敵機襲港　擊落四架</h3>
<p>香港十五日中央社電美駐渝空軍曾於十一日下午以北美（B25）型機及卡其斯（P40）型機二十七架來襲香港，日海軍機隊當即凌空迎擎，經展開熾烈之空戰後，擊落其（B25）型一架，及（P40）型三架，日機則損失一架。</p>
<h3>德軍發表　撤退盧加</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社电德元首行營昨午發表：北部德軍將戰略上之重嬰設施完全破壞後，由盧加市撇退，該市在烈髯格勒南百三十公哩，位於伊爾門及庇普斯兩湖之間，為列甯格勒，普斯柯夫。里加鐵路，及列寗格勒。諾伏哥洛特鐵路上之要衝。</p>
<h3>西綫防務鞏固　德軍枕戈以待　冒險登陸必遭痛擊</h3>
<p>巴鑿十五日中央社電據海通社訊：西綫德軍經司令倫斯台特上將接見海通社採訪主任許羅特，闡述西綫防務甚詳。據稱：「余知敵方已完成進攻歐陸之準備，但吾人亦有準備。大西洋防綫密佈鋼　水泥壘，均依據已往馬奇諾防錢作戰經歷而築成，馬奇諾防緩深度不足，防守不嚴。故保壘與武器均不能阻止德軍之前進，且該綫德東法蘭西中部而止，有遺受包抄之危。而大西洋防緩則建築常固，不處空襲，深度旣足，亦無包抄才咸脅。主緩後方且建有原野堡蠱與據點，並有沼澤，地雷，坦克車牆等項障礙物，為建馬奇諾綫夢想所不及。沿海岸之水中障礙物及沿海灘之水雷地帶，使敵軍難於登陸。至對於大規模在後方降落之空中部隊，亦已採取有效之措置，不過內容守密。如此，敵軍於着陸後，毋須分散進攻每一堡壘，而德軍之坦克車隊及摩托化部隊等均枕戈待戰，可於數小時內發動反攻，而德軍防守之精神，亦非馬奇諾防綫之守軍所能企及云。</p>
<h3>德轟炸機隊　夜擊倫敦</h3>
<p>柏林十五日中央社電昨夜此間軍界消息靈通人士稱：德機第四次大規模襲擊倫敦，其猛烈程度與前數次相等，德機損失遠不及英機之大。克車牆等項陣碍物，為建馬奇諾綫夢想所不及。沿海岸之水中障碍物及沿海難之水雷地帶，使敵軍難於登陸。至對於大規模在後方降落之空中部隊，亦已採取有效之搭置，不過內容守密。如此，敵軍於着陸後，毋須分散進攻每一堡壘，而德軍之坦克車隊及慶托化部隊等均枕戈待戰，可於數小時內發動反攻，而德軍防守之精神，亦非馬奇諾防綫之守軍所能企及云。</p>
<h3>物資統審會　昨召開會議</h3>
<p>南京十五日中央社電行政院物炎統制審議委員會，於昨（十五）日下午三時在京召開第十一次委員會議，由該會委員長周佛海氏親蒞主持，計到有委員袁慈栓，（兼秘書長）顧賓衡，何炳賢，陳之碩，姜佐宜，薛逢元，鄒敬芳，唐壽民，（羅訥齋何元吉代）聞蘭亭，（童侶靑代）袁履登，（羅訥齊代）邵式軍，（部吐珪代）陳光中，（潘文賢代）及日方委員　內，田尻，坂田，池永，岡田等，幹事有尹以煊及該會秘書周化鵬，處長金祖惠等。會議開始首由主席報告畢，即開始討論案件，茲將通過要案四件錄后：　奉統會飭審議棉紗布配給價格標準，應如何規定一案，前經本會第九次會議决議，「交本會上海事務所與各關係方面聯絡審議」等語，茲據該所復稱「除配與各工廠加工者當在商統會研究外，其配給一般消費用者已照商統會所擬廿支紗照收買價格增加一倍，每件定為二萬元，龍頭細布照收買價格增加一倍，每疋定為七百五十元，其他各種型品之配給價格依此類推，此項價格標準每三個月得更訂一次，經不錯絡幹事會議決議通過等情到會已轉請行政院核准公布，提請追認案，决議通過追認。　關於油糧專業委員會擬定油糧價格一案，前經木會第十次會議決議保留，俟再行研究後由委員長核定呈院施行，提交下次會議迫認等語，茲據上海事務所報吿，已與各有　方面聯絡，均認為尙屬可行等情，除呈院外提請追認案，决議通過追認。　米糧統制委員會依據蘇浙皖物资收買配　實施綱要擬具以各地米糧收買數量金額等為基準之交換物責配給券分配群表聯絡經過情形决議通過追認。　自紗布收買後上海市布號同業公會會員（另售商）營業停頓，生計　困，該公會呈請將申請出賣之散裝布疋，按照配給價格，一次付給現金，以責救濟一案，提請决議通過。</p>
<h3>納吐諾區德軍　完成包圍陣　卡西諾增強兵力</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日中央社電據前錢消息稱：美第五軍為牽制德軍對納吐諾撟頭堡之重壓，十三日以來於卡西諾區展開大規模之攻勢。據合衆社電，美軍自十三日開始總反攻以來，已進入市內約達二百碼，而德方之報道則謂美軍一時雖會進入市之中央部，其後經德軍之勇敢反攻，已被逐出。德軍司令官凱賽林元帥業將包國納吐諾橋頭堡之陣勢整備就緒，已得有增強卡西諾區戰鬥之餘力，同時幷侖傘兵部隊在亞特里亞海岸戰緩降下，以強化卡西諾戰綫。</p>
<h3>狙擊杭市長　兇犯捕獲</h3>
<p>杭州十五日中央社電杭州市長譚書產，於本月七日下午一時廿五分，在湖濱路被　徒二人狙擊殉命，軍警　局得訊，即會同日方軍憲，下令　斷交通從事度捕，經三畫夜之檢查，於十日將兇犯全部捕後，犯人　某係受重慶「軍事委員會」密令，於一月下句　入市區，謀　隙　殺市長，遂發生此事。</p>
<h3>說老實話</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會，咋日起召開擴大聯席會譏，出席人員包括該會全體高級幹部及各地區辦事處負責人員。據袁主任委員的報告，是會目的，在於「聽取業務上的報告和建議，以定今後對於業務的設施方針。」昨天報載提案共有七十餘件，報告三十餘各，討論要綱十點</p>
<p>粽觀是會的出席人員，討論要綱的內容，誠然是一個重大的會議。可是，我們以為如果濟濟一堂，官式的提案多，報告詳，並不足以表達是會之重要意義。重要的地方，却在於「民食」，討論有開人民生活的民食問題，使遠到切實改善的目的。如果會議以後，還是毫無成就，那來，不但多此一舉，簡直使米統會多支出一筆鉅大經費，又使人民增加一分負擔而已。</p>
<p>去年十月十九日米統會會在滬召開各地區米糧採辦同業公會籌備委員會議，接着舉行懇談會，交換採辦意見，廿一日叉舉行各地區正副主任聯席會議，也是「濟濟一堂」，也會「周密地」討論過工作大綱，可是，如今四個月了，米統會對於民食問題，解決了些什麼？改善了些什麼？議案執行到如何程度？也許今次出席會員，很多是上次出席會員，我們很誠懇的先請出席諸君子首先加以深切的反省，各人對於本位工作是否盡了責任？尤其是米統會主要負責當局，在我們人民立塲觀察，米統會四個月來的工作，絕對未饜人民的期望，也就是上次大會未會得到收穫。如以這個尺度衡量本次大會，我們特別為出席諸君感到責任得大而戒愼戒懼。</p>
<p>今次會議討論內容，我們當就所見另行貢獻。僅就袁主任委員咋天的開會詞令，我們已有一不無渲染」的感覺。如「幸而內外職員共同努力，得免隕越，漸入正軌，趨向完成使命目的，引為欣慰。」也許是袁主任對於部屢激勵勸勉之意，如果把米統會四個月來的工作成績，嚴格評衡，雖不能說絕對的「隕越」，却也無可「欣慰」。例如米統會成立前後配給米數量的比較，以及黑市米價高低的比較。君子立言，是則是，非則非，當道者說老實話最為人民所同情諒解，我們盼望與會諸君的報告，盡量不韋言，不掩飾的說老實話，取信於人民。</p>
<h3>邀擊第二戰綫　德國準備萬全</h3>
<p>西海岸的撤退</p>
<p>德國所最關心的第二戰綫候補塊依然是挪威，法國北部，及巴爾幹三方面。挪威因海岸的地形，濃勞等關係，登陸頗為容易，是從該方面可向波羅的海緒國進出。法國北部方面，防衛堅固，巴爾幹方面，在春天以前，侵入是不可能的。但總而言之，依常識而言，敵的主力攻勢，將在大西洋岸展開，故西海岸的市民，近幾月來已陸績向內地撇退，西歐海岸成為無人地帶。被密佈的鐵絲網遮斷，軍人以外，禁止入內。</p>
<p>該方面的防禦，硫有金城湯池之固。但在近代戰的條件下，即德國本身亦不相倍這是絕對不能突破的，所以在其背後，構築了幾重的防禦陣地。法國南部方面，偷特許台德將軍　下部隊，在阿維濃　築防衛基地，更在此錢的後力，佈置梯形防禦網，以備從地中海岸成大西洋東南部向來的攻勢</p>
<p>但更重要的是法國北部英法海岸海峽的防備，萬一英美軍能够確保　頭堡時，則德軍將據守北法的卡納爾。特。諾爾，此方面的防衛綫，向東在色當附近按合馬布諾錢，馬奇諾錢的一部已改並，其砲兵陣地將砲口轉向西北，西方。此外，在　斯河，聖普爾河，奇爾河，阿爾倍運河，及荷　的全海岸錢，均已講築要塞，社爾多萊希特，哈格，洛特丹，阿姆斯特丹諸都市，均有要塞點綴於其間。</p>
<p>德國防綫鞏固</p>
<p>以齊格　　為底部的梯形防衛相縱，也已由蘇聯軍俘　重建。在大西洋防缺與齊格斐防機中間，從鄧扣克至巴盎努地方，配有機動部隊二十個師團，準備立即赴援敵的攻擊地點或友軍的危險區城。這中間的陸上戰，專以機動戰為前提　進行準備，其機動戰中心，恐將利用波頗多，波阿齊，安格魯姆，羅覺，倫諾，都爾，阿米安及共他法國諸都市，邀擊艾森霍　的主力羅美爾元帥　下預備軍，形成這防衛組織的一部，防備　頗為堅強。</p>
<p>德國克服了很多的困難，特這中間地帶，為機動戰而使之組織化。但德國方面的問題是人力與責材的缺乏。第二戰　的　擊準備，除上述的防　設備外，　前正在紛紛暄傳中的秘密兵器之準備，亦决不能忽視。何種秘密兵器業已準　就褚，尙不明　，但長十四米，重量十二噸以上的臼砲，及用卡泰派爾特式發進器的水上機，是在想像中的。而且那不是防禦的，乃是攻擊的武器。</p>
<p>可是在一定地點，一定時問，葉中點倒優勢的兵力，各個繫破敵兵力，道是德方作戰的目標，德國方而特別重視辨動戰的理由，大半亦在於此點。他方，反軸心方面　淤甲部隊之褻動，期待極為殷切；反之，德國方面則相信游擊部隊毫無危險。（　：譯自一月二十六日　賣報知）</p>

<h3>松平情報部長　談英對渝政策　企圖緩和反英空氣</h3>
<p>中央社訊日大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，於十五日在招待外人新聞記者席上，就英國之對渝方政策，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>對英反感日益滋長最近英國對渝万專施用欺瞞政策，企圖緩和渝方軍民之對英反盛。蓋中國民族之對英反感，自雅片戰爭以來，因英國之侵略中國日亟，故反英熟潮，亦日見高漲，曾數次發生反英運動，然能奸巨猾之英國，每次輒以武力或巧言蜜語，籠絡中國。大東亞戰爭勃發後，英國在香港昭南對華僑之態度，極為冷淡，在緬甸則坐視渝軍潰減，見死不救。父　將印度獨立運動首領甘地，尼赫魯等，投諸監獄，加以虐待，並將一部份渝軍歸屬於蒙特巴頓指揮。凡此種種，均為渝方有心軍民所痛心疾首，對英反感，遂亦日益滋長。</p>
<p>所謂借款迄未實現日前英國為緩和反英空氣起見，乃派遣二年前聲明供給渝盿五千萬鎊借款之議員　來華視察，一面並口頭宣言，撒廢租界治外法權，熱烈招待由王世杰領導之渝方視察團等，一意討好渝方。然英國之所作所為、無論何時，僅為口頭春風，毫無實質可言，故渝方固不待論，即美國政府，對於英國之所為，亦極表不滿。最近據路透社倫教電，前年英國政府所聲明之五千萬鎊借款，實際上附有種種條件，故迄未實現，其內容最近即將發表云。由此可知，其附有各種秘密條件，實不難想像。最近據由重慶歸來者談稱，最近富地英美商號，紛紛設立，總數在五百家以上，恣意搜刮圖利，此亦小外為英國式利用其他民族之狡猾表現也。</p>

<h3>Internal Draft of a Tobacco Prohibition Proposal Passed by the Executive Yuan Yesterday: The National Government Decides to Eliminate Drugs Within Three Years</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan held its 196th regular meeting today. The following is an excerpt of the proposals discussed: The Minister of the Interior, Mei, presented a draft of the major outline for tobacco prohibition measures, which was passed by the council and submitted to the National Defense Council for approval before being promulgated and implemented.</p>
<p>The New National Movement Promotion Committee proposed a plan for both tobacco and drug prohibition training. The proposal was resolved to be referred to the Ministry of Interior for reference. The Director of the Department of Health, Lu, submitted a revised draft on the management of narcotics (narcotics for medical and scientific use), which was resolved to be amended and passed according to review opinions and submitted to the Central Political Committee. This proposal will be promoted in parallel with the tobacco prohibition plan and is also one of the drug eradication measures. The Agriculture Production Promotion Committee, also serving as Chairman, submitted draft general rules for the organization of agricultural production promotion committees in various provinces and cities, which was resolved and passed. The Jiangxi Provincial Government was reorganized, with the heads of the Finance, Politics, and Construction Departments remaining in their positions. The position of the head of government affairs was taken over by Liu Ling.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Opium has plagued China for over a century, its harm exceeding that of floods and ferocious beasts. China's weakness is largely due to the deep penetration of opium into the people, leading to national weakness and poverty. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang, while serving as the head of the Executive Yuan, recognized that without eliminating opium, there was a real danger of national extinction and racial decline. He then, with the greatest determination and strict procedures, promulgated a five-year opium prohibition plan. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of incidents, the opium prohibition work was stalled. Now, the government authorities, in order to continue and complete the opium prohibition plan, aim to restore national health, cultivate national vitality, and contribute to the great cause of co-prosperity in East Asia. The major outline for the opium prohibition measures has already been drafted by the Ministry of the Interior, submitted to the Executive Yuan, and passed at the 196th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. It has also been submitted to the National Defense Council for approval before being promulgated and implemented. The plan is set for a three-year period to completely eliminate opium and all drugs. With a shortened timeframe and strict measures, domestic opium can be swept away and cleared within these three years. The Minister of the Interior, Mei, and the Director-General of the Youth Corps, Lin, both made earnest speeches on this matter, explaining the government's determination to prohibit drugs. At the same time, the authorities of the Japanese Embassy in China also made a statement, expressing their cooperation with the National Government's opium and drug prohibition policy and warning Japanese residents to deeply refrain from opium and strengthen their cooperation in promoting the opium policy.</p>
<p>Key Points of Tobacco Prohibition Measures</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Minister of the Interior, Mei, discussed the key points of the tobacco prohibition measures as follows: Complete elimination of opium within three years. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, Chairman Wang, while serving as the head of the Executive Yuan, vigorously implemented opium prohibition and enacted "Implementation Measures for Opium Prohibition," which were promulgated on April 18th of that year, stipulating a five-year deadline from the 25th year to the 29th year of the Republic of China to eliminate opium. Subsequently, due to the outbreak of incidents in the 26th year, the implementation was suspended. Now, continuing the aforementioned policy, it is stipulated that from March 30th of the 33rd year of the Republic of China to March 29th of the 36th year of the Republic of China, a three-year deadline is set to eliminate opium. Absolute prohibition of opium poppy cultivation. To rigorously implement opium prohibition, prohibiting cultivation is the prerequisite. Once the source of opium poppy cultivation is cut off, prohibiting transportation and smoking will be easier to achieve. Furthermore, cultivating opium poppies not only is the root of opium addiction but also hinders legitimate agricultural production. At this time of encouraging increased production, prohibition is especially necessary. Therefore, within the peaceful regions, strict prohibition of opium poppy cultivation is enforced. Implementation of opium addict registration. All opium addicts who have not yet quit their addiction will be subject to registration and strictly ordered to quit in stages according to the three-year deadline. Establishment of widespread opium cessation hospitals. Opium cessation hospitals will be widely established in the central government and major cities to actively equip and enforce registration. Opium addicts will be required to undergo cessation treatment on schedule to eliminate bad habits. Immediate eradication of drug atmosphere. Drugs such as heroin and red pills are even more harmful than opium and will be immediately and strictly prohibited. Regardless of manufacturing, selling, or using drugs, all are absolutely prohibited, and offenders will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department, commemorating the second anniversary of the Japanese army's occupation of Singapore and the government's passage of opium prohibition measures, held a broadcast at the Central Radio Station last night, the 15th, entitled "Eradicating Drugs and Prohibiting Opium to Strike Down Britain and America." It elaborated that eradicating drugs and prohibiting opium and striking down Britain and America are one and the same. To thoroughly strike down Britain and America, one must eradicate drugs and prohibit opium. To thoroughly eradicate drugs and prohibit opium, one must also strike down Britain and America, and so on.</p>
<h3>Statement Released by the Japanese Embassy</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The authorities of the Japanese Embassy in China stated that the National Government's Executive Yuan meeting on the 15th of this month passed the major outline of the opium and drug prohibition plan, aiming to resolutely prohibit opium and all drugs within a three-year period, mobilizing national manpower and resources to seek China's recovery and fulfill the great mission of defending East Asia. This is a manifestation of the National Government authorities' door-to-door spirit and is sincerely admirable.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of secret trade by the East India Company, the harm that opium has inflicted on China is truly astonishing. It has been one hundred and five years since Lin Zexu burned 20,000 chests of opium. On this day, which coincides with the second anniversary of the fall of Britain's base for aggression in East Asia, the National Government raises the banner of opium prohibition, recalling the past, which is truly deeply moving.</p>
<p>The Imperial Government has experience in implementing opium prohibition policies in Taiwan and has also provided various technical assistance to the opium cessation policy in Manchukuo. Regarding the National Government's future promotion of opium and drug prohibition policies, if there is anything that needs assistance, we will not hesitate to provide all cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding opium and all drugs, the Imperial Government has always strictly ordered the crackdown on Japanese residents in China. In addition to handling cases according to criminal law, we have also specially formulated the "Regulations for the Crackdown on Narcotics in the Republic of China and Detailed Rules for Implementation," strictly controlling the manufacture, transportation, and storage of narcotics and raw opium. However, after years of war, despite the strict orders of the consular authorities, there are still those who evade the law and commit illegal acts, which is truly regrettable. Now that the National Government has decided to implement the opium cessation policy, we will naturally impose decisive punishments on such illegal acts according to the law. It is hoped that Japanese residents in China will deeply recognize the importance of the current situation and that China and Japan will cooperate in promoting the opium prohibition policy. Those who use the name of extraterritorial jurisdiction to engage in misconduct will leave the greatest stain on the history of the Japanese Empire's advancement in the Greater East Asia War, and they must deeply reflect on their behavior.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference Is of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference is scheduled to be held in Tokyo around June. Peng, the Director-General of the North China New People's Society, recently made a statement on this matter, stating that the Greater East Asia Conference held last November and the subsequent meeting of heads of the Asian Revival Organizations thoroughly explained Japan's broad intentions to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to all ethnic groups. At the same time, the enthusiasm of the one billion people of Greater East Asia to cooperate in the war has become more inspired. The Greater East Asia Declaration is to clarify the lofty ideals common to the one billion people of Greater East Asia. In order to implement it, if each ethnic group and country does not launch a strong national movement or ethnic movement, then the declaration of Greater East Asia will also become a mere formality, and the holding of the Greater East Asia Ethnic Conference is timely and appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Launches an Annihilation War in Buthidaung; The Enemy's Retreat Route Is Cut Off, Leading to Great Chaos</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army front-line base in Burma, the elite units of the Japanese army are currently narrowing the encirclement line in a certain area northwest of Buthidaung. The main force of the British 7th Division, numbering approximately tens of thousands, possessing a number of tanks and hundreds of motorized heavy vehicles, is making efforts to replenish food and ammunition by air drop, attempting to break through the Japanese army's encirclement line, but there is no hope and is only awaiting annihilation. The enemy army is unable to reverse its decline, has lost its retreat route, and has fallen into great chaos. It appears that the enemy division commander and his staff have abandoned their troops in a certain area and escaped by plane. Furthermore, when the Japanese army began its offensive, enemy units in the Mayu Mountains attempted to escape to a certain area of Naft Head via the Naf River. These troops were also subjected to fierce attacks by Japanese aircraft and annihilated at the bottom of the Naf River. The Japanese army, coordinating air and land forces, launched an annihilation war in Buthidaung, which is now at its final stage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Indian National Army is cooperating with the Japanese army in combat, activating the battlefield and greatly shocking the enemy's Indian army. Hundreds of Indian soldiers surrender to the Japanese army every day. Therefore, the morale of the British Indian army has been shaken, spreading throughout the army. Arakan can be said to be the ignition point for a general uprising of Indians.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Pingnan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Chongqing, Japanese aircraft formations bombed Pingnan, located on the north bank of the Xun River in eastern Guangxi Province, on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Enemy Ships Near New Guinea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army front-line base in the South Pacific, the Japanese naval air squadrons attacked and achieved the following battle results in various locations in New Britain and New Guinea on the 14th: One enemy transport ship was hit at Cape Cretin in New Britain Island, and one enemy destroyer was destroyed near the Bena Bena wharf south of Ufimshi in New Guinea. One enemy large transport ship was heavily damaged in Volgan Bay, New Britain Island. In addition, the enemy's spirit positions on Aroe Island and Zierb were attacked. In all these battles, the Japanese air squadrons suffered no losses and all aircraft safely returned to their original defenses.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 15th (Central News Agency) - U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, using twenty-seven North American (B25) and Curtiss (P40) aircraft, attacked Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 11th. Japanese naval air squadrons immediately intercepted them in the air, and after a fierce aerial battle, shot down one (B25) and three (P40) aircraft. The Japanese side lost one aircraft.</p>
<h3>German Army Announces Withdrawal from Luga</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced yesterday afternoon that the northern German army completely destroyed strategically important facilities and withdrew from the city of Luga. The city is located 130 kilometers south of Leningrad, between Lakes Ilmen and Peipus, and is a key hub on the Leningrad-Pskov-Riga railway and the Leningrad-Novgorod railway.</p>
<h3>Western Front Defenses Consolidated, German Army Ready and Waiting, Adventurous Landings Will Be Severely Struck</h3>
<p>Paris, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report by the Havas News Agency, General Rundstedt, the commander of the German army on the Western Front, met with the head of the Havas News Agency's interview department, Xu Luote, and elaborated in detail on the defenses of the Western Front. It was stated that "I know that the enemy has completed preparations for an invasion of Europe, but we are also prepared. The Atlantic Defense Line is densely covered with steel and concrete fortifications, all built based on past experiences in the Maginot Line operations. The Maginot Line lacked sufficient depth and was not strictly defended. Therefore, the fortifications and weapons could not stop the German army's advance, and the line ended in central eastern France, leaving it vulnerable to encirclement. The Atlantic Defense Line, on the other hand, is built to be strong and solid, invulnerable to air raids, with sufficient depth, and has no threat of encirclement. Behind the main line, field fortifications and strongholds have also been built, along with swamps, mines, and tank walls, which the dreams of building the Maginot Line could not achieve. Water obstacles along the coast and minefields along the beaches make it difficult for the enemy army to land. As for large-scale airborne troops landing in the rear, effective measures have also been taken, but the details are kept secret. In this way, after the enemy army lands, they do not need to disperse to attack each fortress, and the German army's tank fleets and motorized units are all ready and waiting for battle, ready to launch a counterattack within a few hours. The German army's spirit of defense is also unmatched by the defending forces of the Maginot Line," he said.</p>
<h3>German Bomber Squadron Night-Attacks London</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Last night, well-informed military sources here stated that German aircraft launched their fourth large-scale attack on London, with intensity equal to the previous few times. German aircraft losses were far less than those of the British aircraft. The walls and other obstacles are something that the construction of the Maginot Line could not have dreamed of. The water obstacles along the coast and the minefields along the beaches make it difficult for the enemy to land. As for the large-scale airborne troops landing in the rear, effective measures have also been taken, but the details are kept secret. In this way, after the enemy lands, they do not need to disperse their forces to attack each fortress, and the German army's tank fleets and motorized units are all ready and waiting, able to launch a counterattack within a few hours, and the German army's defense spirit is something that the defenders of the Maginot Line cannot compare with."</p>
<h3>Materials Control Committee Holds Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Executive Yuan's Materials Control Review Committee held its eleventh committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) in Nanjing. The meeting was personally chaired by the committee's chairman, Mr. Zhou Fohai. The following committee members were present: Yuan Cisuan (also Secretary-General), Gu Binheng, He Bingxian, Chen Zhishuo, Jiang Zuoyi, Xue Fengyuan, Zou Jingfang, Tang Shoumin (represented by Luo Nezhai and He Yuanji), Wen Lanting (represented by Tong Lüqing), Yuan Lüdeng (represented by Luo Nezhai), Shao Shijun (represented by Bu Tugui), Chen Guangzhong (represented by Pan Wenxian), and Japanese committee members 　Nouchi, Tajiri, Sakata, Ikenaga, and Okada. The secretaries present were Yin Yixuan and the committee's secretary, Zhou Huapeng, and Director Jin Zuhui. After the chairman's report at the beginning of the meeting, discussion of the cases began. The following are the four major cases that were passed: Regarding the case of how to stipulate the standards for the distribution prices of cotton yarn and cloth as instructed by the United Control Committee, the committee's ninth meeting previously resolved to "hand it over to the Shanghai office of the committee to liaise with all relevant parties for review." According to the office's reply, "In addition to those distributed to various factories for processing, which should be studied by the Business Control Committee, those distributed for general consumption will be increased by one time the purchase price according to the Business Control Committee's proposed price for 20-count yarn, with each piece set at 20,000 yuan. Dragon head fine cloth will be increased by one time the purchase price, with each bolt set at 750 yuan. The distribution prices of other types of products will be deduced by analogy. This price standard can be revised once every three months. After discussion and resolution by the staff meeting, it has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The case is submitted for retroactive approval." Resolved to approve retroactively. Regarding the case of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee's proposed oil and grain prices, the committee's tenth meeting previously resolved to retain it, pending further study, and the chairman will approve it and submit it to the Executive Yuan for implementation. It will be submitted to the next meeting for retroactive approval. According to a report from the Shanghai office, it has been in contact with all parties concerned, and all believe that it is still feasible. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan, the case is submitted for retroactive approval. Resolved to approve retroactively. The Rice and Grain Control Committee, based on the "Outline for the Implementation of Material Purchase and Distribution in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui," formulated a table of distribution groups for material distribution vouchers based on the quantity and amount of rice and grain purchased in various places. The process of contacting and coordinating was resolved and approved retroactively. Since the purchase of yarn and cloth, the business of members of the Shanghai Cloth Dealers Association (retailers) has been suspended, and their livelihoods are difficult. The association submitted a request to pay cash once according to the distribution price for the scattered cloth to be sold in order to provide relief. The motion was submitted for a decision and passed.</p>
<h3>German Army in Nettuno Area Completes Encirclement; Reinforcements for Cassino</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line sources, the U.S. Fifth Army launched a large-scale offensive in the Cassino area since the 13th in order to contain the German army's heavy pressure on the Nettuno bridgehead. According to the United Press, the U.S. military has entered the city by about 200 yards since the general counteroffensive began on the 13th, while German reports state that although the U.S. military temporarily entered the central part of the city, it was later driven out by the German army's brave counteroffensive. German Army Commander Field Marshal Kesselring has completed the preparation of the encirclement of the Nettuno bridgehead and has been able to reinforce the fighting in the Cassino area. At the same time, a parachute unit was dropped on the Adriatic coast to strengthen the Cassino front.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Hangzhou Mayor Arrested</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Tan Shusheng, the mayor of Hangzhou, was assassinated by two bandits on Hubin Road at 1:25 PM on the 7th of this month and died. The military and police departments, upon receiving the news, immediately coordinated with the Japanese military police, ordered the interruption of traffic, and engaged in capture operations. After three days and nights of investigation, all the assassins were arrested on the 10th. The perpetrator, XX, was under a secret order from the Chongqing "Military Affairs Commission" and entered the urban area in the lower sentences of January, plotting to assassinate the mayor, which led to this incident.</p>
<h3>Telling the Truth</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee held an expanded joint conference yesterday, with attendees including all senior cadres of the committee and responsible personnel from various regional offices. According to the report of Director Yuan, the purpose of the meeting was to "listen to reports and suggestions on business matters in order to determine the future direction of business facilities." Yesterday's newspaper reported that there were more than 70 proposals, more than 30 reports, and 10 points in the discussion outline.</p>
<p>Looking at the attendees of the meeting and the content of the discussion outline, it is indeed an important meeting. However, we believe that if everyone is present, the official proposals are numerous, and the reports are detailed, it is not enough to express the important significance of the meeting. The important thing is the "people's food," discussing the people's food problems related to people's lives, so as to achieve the goal of practical improvement. If there is still no achievement after the meeting, then it is not only superfluous, but simply makes the Rice and Grain Control Committee spend a huge amount of money and increases the burden on the people.</p>
<p>On October 19th of last year, the Rice and Grain Control Committee held a preparatory committee meeting of rice and grain procurement trade associations in various regions in Shanghai. Then, a symposium was held to exchange procurement opinions. On the 21st, a joint meeting of deputy directors in various regions was also held. It was also "everyone was present" and the work outline was discussed "thoroughly." However, now, four months later, what has the Rice and Grain Control Committee solved for the people's food problem? What has it improved? To what extent has the proposal been implemented? Perhaps many of the members attending this time are the members who attended last time. We sincerely ask all the gentlemen attending to first deeply reflect on whether they have fulfilled their responsibilities for their respective work. Especially the main responsible authorities of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, from the perspective of our people, the work of the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past four months has absolutely not met the expectations of the people, that is, the last meeting did not achieve any results. If we measure this meeting with this standard, we especially feel that the gentlemen attending have a great responsibility and should be cautious and fearful.</p>
<p>We will contribute our views separately on the content of this meeting's discussion based on what we have seen. Just from Director Yuan's opening remarks yesterday, we already have a feeling of "not being rendered without exaggeration." For example, "Fortunately, the internal and external staff have worked together to avoid failure, gradually entered the right track, and moved towards the completion of the mission and goals, which is gratifying." Perhaps this is Director Yuan's intention to encourage and exhort his subordinates. If we strictly evaluate the work results of the Rice and Grain Control Committee in the past four months, although we cannot say that it is absolutely "failure," it is also not "gratifying." For example, compare the amount of rice distributed before and after the establishment of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, as well as the comparison of the high and low black market rice prices. A gentleman's words are yes if they are yes, and no if they are no. It is most sympathetic and understanding for those in power to tell the truth to the people. We hope that the reports of the participants will try not to be false, not to hide, and to tell the truth to win the trust of the people.</p>
<h3>Germany Is Fully Prepared for Inviting and Attacking the Second Front</h3>
<p>The Retreat on the West Coast</p>
<p>The candidate areas for the second front that Germany is most concerned about are still Norway, northern France, and the Balkans. Norway is relatively easy to land on due to its coastal terrain and dense labor force, and it can advance to the Baltic Sea countries from that direction. The northern part of France is heavily defended, and it is impossible to invade the Balkans before spring. But in short, according to common sense, the enemy's main offensive will unfold on the Atlantic coast, so the residents of the west coast have been retreating to the interior in recent months, and the west European coast has become a no-man's land. It is blocked by densely laid barbed wire, and no one is allowed to enter except for military personnel.</p>
<p>The defense of this area has the solidity of a golden city with a moat. But under the conditions of modern warfare, even Germany itself does not double that this is absolutely impossible to break through, so several layers of defensive positions have been built behind it. In southern France, General Thunnert, commander of the troops in Avignon, built a defense base, and a trapezoidal defense network was set up behind this front to prepare for an offensive from the Mediterranean coast or the southeastern Atlantic.</p>
<p>But more important is the defense of the English Channel coast in northern France. If the British and American forces are able to secure a bridgehead, then the German army will hold on to Calais, Dunkirk, and Normandy in northern France. The defense line in this area is connected to the Maginot Line near Sedan to the east. Part of the Maginot Line has been modified, and its artillery positions have turned their muzzles to the northwest and west. In addition, fortresses have been built along the Scarpe River, the Saint-Pol River, the Dyle River, the Albert Canal, and the entire Dutch coast. The cities of Schelderecht, The Hague, Rotterdam, and Amsterdam are dotted with fortresses.</p>
<p>German Defense Lines are Solid</p>
<p>The trapezoidal defense phase vertical line with the Siegfried Line as the bottom has also been rebuilt by Soviet prisoners of war. Between the Atlantic defense and the Siegfried Line, there are twenty mobile divisions deployed from Dunkirk to Baan Noutz, ready to immediately rush to the aid of the enemy's attack location or the danger zone of friendly forces. The land battle in the middle is prepared on the premise of mobile warfare, and the center of its mobile warfare will probably use Poppau, Poassy, Angoulême, La Rochelle, Rennes, Tours, Amiens, and other French cities to invite and attack Eisenhower's main force. Marshal Rommel's reserve army forms a part of this defense organization, and the defense is quite strong.</p>
<p>Germany overcame many difficulties and organized this intermediate zone for mobile warfare. But the problem for Germany is the lack of manpower and equipment. The preparation for striking the second front, in addition to the above-mentioned defense facilities, the preparation of secret weapons that are currently being rumored cannot be ignored. It is not clear what kind of secret weapons have been prepared, but mortars with a length of more than 14 meters and a weight of more than 12 tons, and seaplanes with catapulte-style launchers are being imagined. Moreover, those are not defensive, but offensive weapons.</p>
<p>But the goal of German operations is to concentrate superior forces at a certain location and at a certain time to break through the enemy's forces one by one. The reason why Germany places special emphasis on discriminatory warfare is mostly due to this point. On the other hand, the anti-Axis side is eagerly awaiting the disturbances of the guerrilla forces; on the other hand, the German side believes that the guerrilla forces are not dangerous.

<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>The meeting began with an opening address by Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Committee, followed by speeches from Vice Chairmen Hiroya Junichi and Chen Guoquan.  Commander Takagi Kenji of Unit 1629, Counselor Okazaki of the Embassy, Committee Members Lin Kanghou, Ueda Kenjiro, and Jiang Weisheng also delivered encouraging speeches.

After the conclusion of the general meeting at 6 PM, proposals from committee members and regional directors, as well as ad hoc motions, were immediately divided into eight small groups for specific discussions and solutions, with the intention to continue the meeting today to make decisions.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Yuan Ludeng's address stated: "It has been nearly four months since the establishment of this Committee. During these four months, we have been faced with numerous internal and external affairs. In the initial stages, everything was in need of attention. Fortunately, with the joint efforts of all staff members internally and colleagues in regional offices externally, we have largely avoided setbacks and are gradually getting on the right track... heading towards the fulfillment of our original mission. This is something I find gratifying and for which I am grateful to all my colleagues. However, the Committee's responsibilities are significant, and the path ahead is still fraught with challenges, requiring even greater efforts from us. Therefore, taking advantage of this post-Spring Festival break, I have convened this expanded joint meeting of senior officials and responsible personnel from regional offices to hear everyone's reports and suggestions on their work, in order to determine the Committee's future policies regarding operational facilities. Furthermore, there have been some factual changes in the Committee's affairs during these four months. Although the first phase of rice procurement has reached the planned quantity, the second phase is just beginning. Given the different situations in various regions, how should we proceed to fulfill our mission? And based on the past four months, what major aspects of rice affairs and operations should be established or reformed? These are naturally questions that I and all of you colleagues are eager to understand. I hope everyone will express their broad views and engage in open-minded discussions, so that we can gather wisdom and benefit from diverse perspectives, reach conclusions, and contribute them to the Committee as a reference for policy implementation. In short, the purpose of this expanded joint meeting is to review the past, examine the present, and contemplate the future. It is the first sincere and open gathering of the Committee's cadres and responsible personnel from regional offices. I respectfully offer my sincere appreciation and welcome the opinions of all colleagues."</p>
<h3>Matsudaira Information Director Discusses British Policy Towards Chongqing - Attempts to Alleviate Anti-British Sentiment</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch states that Matsudaira, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, made the following remarks on the 15th at a reception for foreign journalists, regarding Britain's policy toward Chongqing:</p>
<p>Growing Anti-British Sentiment</p>
<p>Recently, Britain has been employing deceptive policies towards Chongqing in an attempt to alleviate the anti-British sentiment among the military and civilians there. The Chinese people's anti-British sentiment has been growing ever since the Opium War due to Britain's increasing aggression towards China. Consequently, the anti-British tide has been rising, and there have been several anti-British movements. However, the cunning and treacherous British have repeatedly used force or honeyed words to appease China. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain's attitude towards overseas Chinese in Hong Kong and Syonan was extremely cold, and in Burma, they stood by and watched the Chongqing army suffer losses, refusing to offer assistance. Furthermore, they imprisoned and mistreated Gandhi, Nehru, and other leaders of the Indian independence movement, and placed a portion of the Chongqing army under the command of Mountbatten. All of these actions have caused pain and indignation among concerned military and civilians in Chongqing, leading to a growing anti-British sentiment.</p>
<p>So-Called Loans Have Not Yet Materialized</p>
<p>Recently, in order to alleviate anti-British sentiment, Britain dispatched an official who had promised to provide Chongqing with a loan of 50 million pounds two years ago to China for inspection. At the same time, they verbally declared the abolition of concessions and extraterritorial rights and warmly welcomed a Chongqing delegation led by Wang Shijie, making every effort to please Chongqing. However, Britain's actions, as always, are merely empty promises with no substance. Therefore, not only Chongqing but even the United States government is extremely dissatisfied with Britain's actions. According to a recent Reuters dispatch from London, the 50 million-pound loan promised by the British government the year before last actually came with various conditions and has not yet materialized. The details are expected to be released soon. From this, it is not difficult to imagine that it is attached with various secret conditions. According to recent reports from those returning from Chongqing, numerous British and American firms have been established recently, totaling over 500, engaging in reckless exploitation for profit. This is also a cunning manifestation of the British-style exploitation of other nations.</p>
<h3>New Association to Host Banquet for Matsudaira Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Press Association will host a banquet this evening (the 16th) at 6 PM at the Industrial and Commercial Association on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building to welcome the new Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, Matsudaira.

<h3>Entertainment Consumption Tax to Be Implemented from April 1st, Divided into Three Categories with a Maximum Rate of 40%</h3>
<p>The Special Consumption Tax on the Donation and Sale of Goods and the Consumption Tax on Banquets and Hotels have been implemented since February 1st. According to Japanese newspapers, the Entertainment Consumption Tax will also be implemented starting April 1st. This Entertainment Consumption Tax is divided into three categories. Category A includes movies, horse racing, ice skating, swimming, etc., with a tax rate of 10% of operating income. However, for horse racing, in addition to 10% of the total operating revenue, a 10% tax will also be levied on prize money. Category B includes singing and dancing, acting, etc., with a tax rate of 30% of the entrance price. Category C includes other luxury entertainment items, with a tax rate of 40% of the ticket price or the total daily operating income. The methods for tax collection, as well as regulations regarding business registration, accounting books, and penalties, will be handled in accordance with the thirteen articles of the promulgated Provisional Regulations on Entertainment Consumption Tax.</p>
<h3>Rural Pacification and Blockade Administration Hosts Press Corps</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch states that the Shanghai Special Municipality's Rural Pacification and Blockade Administration hosted a grand banquet at the Hua Yan Apartment on the 10th floor yesterday (the 15th) at 5:30 PM to foster relationships with the city's press corps and report on the blockade efforts. Present were Xu Liqiu, Acting President of the China Daily; Yan Jiabao, Vice President; Zhou Huarun, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Branch of the China-Japan Cultural Association; Chen Bin, President of Shen Bao (represented by Liu Han); Yang, Acting Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency; Chen Ying, Editor-in-Chief; and reporters from various newspapers, totaling no less than fifty people. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. Director Mo Yade of the Administration delivered a speech, expressing his hope for more criticism and guidance on future blockade efforts and stating that he would do his best to adopt and implement them. The banquet then began, with guests and hosts engaging in lively conversations over drinks.</p>

<h3>Daily Necessities Black Market Rampant - Municipal Government Orders Investigation and Suppression - Aiming to Make the Rationing System Comprehensive</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency dispatch) The scarcity of resources during wartime is an inevitable trend. Furthermore, the hoarding and speculation by unscrupulous merchants have caused prices to rise continuously, directly and indirectly affecting society and threatening people's livelihoods. Therefore, the authorities are actively promoting frugality on the one hand and implementing a rationing system based on household registration on the other, with the aim of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Now that rationing has been implemented for (cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, candles, soap, and matches), the prices of these items should have stabilized. However, as soon as rationing is implemented, a black market arises, undermining wartime economic policies, which is truly hateful. A reporter has learned that the Shanghai Special Municipality has issued separate orders to its subordinate police stations to investigate and suppress any black market activities involving (cotton yarn, cotton cloth, coal briquettes, soap, candles, and matches) within their respective jurisdictions. They must not show favoritism and must strive to make the rationing system more comprehensive.</p>
