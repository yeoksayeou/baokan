<h3>呂宋島東方海面　日潛艦呼應作戰　放魚雷擊沉敵驅艦及空母</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　敵美於台灣海面受創以來，機動部隊之用法，極爲愼重，空襲菲律賓時，縮短時間，採取偷襲戰術，二十一日始利用呂宋東方海面之縣劣天氣，再度接近菲律賓，二十五日上午七時左右，空製呂宋島各地，日神風特別攻擊隊當即前往搜索，突破敵防禦機動部隊之戰鬥機羣，施以猛炸，當炸沉敵大型及中型空母各一艘，大型巡洋艦一艘，目下敵美艦隊三而集中遊弋呂宋海面，日某號潛水艦呼應空中作戰，二十五日亦駛往迎擊，在敵空母三艘，戰艦一艘，驅遂艦數艘作分離行動時，發射魚雷四枚，一枚擊沉驅逐艦一艘，其他三枚命中敵中型空母，當即發生大爆聲，諒亦沉沒，日潛水艦於達成目的後，曾見敵軍救援迪難者之狼狽情景。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　菲律賓東方海面之美軍機動部隊，近已轉攻爲守，艦上機之機型，亦多爲防衛用之戰鬥機，此乃係菲律賓海面海戰以來，因遭日神風特別攻擊隊及其他航空部隊之猛擊，已使其感到恐怖所致。按日大本營於二十五日發表，自台灣海面海戰以來，美軍被炸沉炸毀之航空母艦，合計已達五十一艘，由此亦可知敵美所遭損失奇重之一斑。又最近襲擊哈遜島之美機數亦形激滅，十三日該島各地來襲機數的五百架，十四日約四百架，十九日累計約五百架，至二十五日午前約二百架，午後不過十數架，由來襲機數激减下情形顴之，亦可知美航空母艦勢力低下之情形矣。</p>
<h3>日靖國攻擊隊　衝撞敵艦船　掌握雷伊泰灣制空權</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日陸軍機特別攻擊隊（靖國隊）二十六日攻擊雷伊泰灣內敵運輸船團，侖中大型運輸船三艘。使之起火，爰靖國隊出丸，谷川兩少尉及木下上士駕駛之特別攻擊機三架，由二十六日上午十時四十分起至十時四十五分之間，於塔克羅班海面，對敵大型運輸船二艘，各以一架衝撞敵船，遂重傷爆炸，共他一架則於塔古羅班北方水這入口，衝撞敵大型運輸船一艘，使之起火　之該靖團隊村岡軍　所　之機，於馬尼卡尼島南方，衝敵大型船，亦使其重創起火。</p>
<p>菲賓前棧基地二十七日中央社電　菲律賓日美空戰，已達最高度，日空軍連日晝夜制壓戰塲上空，更攻擊敵後方補繼基地之積蓄戰力，計劃作一大反攻至二十二日，戰機成熟，開始猛攻，殲滅敵空軍，二十二·三·四日，日軍航空部隊連續以大編隊攻擊敵軍補繼基地摩羅泰島，收獲輝煌戰果，計二十二汨機塲起火者二十二處，被炸毀者十七處，二十三日機塲焚毀三處，炸毀三處，二十二·三·兩日，擊毀敵機八十九架，二十四日敵機起火者七處。同時該島日軍陸地部隊與航空部隊猛攻呼應，突擊隊亦趨活躍，最近更得援軍，士氣益加振奮，予敵以重大打擊，使敵機塲數處陷於不能使用。另一航空部隊亦猛製雷伊泰灣敵航艦及該島敵陣，獲得戰果如次：（一）雷伊泰灣二十二日擊沉運輸船一艘，擊毀驅逐艦一艘，二十三日擊沉大型遝轍船一艘，登陸用舟艇二艘，二十四日擊毀運輸船四艘。（二）雷伊泰島二十四日敵機場起火者七處，炸毀一處，防空陣地起火者一處，燃料庫一處，另一監視敵機動部隊動向之日軍航空部隊，二十五日晨在呂宋島東方海面發見機動部隊三羣，日軍神風特別攻擊隊乃即時出動，作白晝攻擊，擊沉大型空母一艘，大型巡洋艦一艘，日軍特別攻擊隊仍繼續猛攻中，戰果可望擴大，因日空軍之先制攻擊，敵航空戰力之擴充顯受阻止。決定菲律賓決戰之雷伊泰週邊制空權，日軍益趨有利。</p>
<h3>日神風機高德隊　冒雨作壯烈衝擊</h3>
<p>菲島前綫二十七日中央社電　敵艦載機二十五日晨以數隊侵入馬尼刺地區，但是日由於日神風特攻隊對呂宋島東方海面敵機動部隊之肉搏，敵已遭潰滅打擊，故其空母已不能收容搭載機，愴惶逃往東方，此先發制人攻擊之神風隊，爲第六次編成之高德隊，計有五人，飛機五架與六掩護機，茲將掩護機隊長天上等飛行中士談當時壯烈之衝擊詳情如次：神風特別攻擊隊離陸未幾即降雨，於某海角上空擬行降陸，然因天氣惡劣而未果，單機按照預定路綫勇壯飛行，飛約數小時，始漸放晴，武裝之三架特別攻擊機，安然飛行，移時指揮官機及其他掩護機遭遇敵巨人機，視界完全不明矣。須臾左側前方海面有數十條白色航綫，於是隊發見南進之一羣敵有力機動部隊，以前方之制式空母二艘與後方之中型空母二艘爲中心，並配有戰艦四艘，於其外廓有巡洋艦約六艘護衛，更有驅逐艦十數艘從事防護。日方攻擊機判明其輪型陣後，即入于突擊態勢，敵方已全艦開砲射擊，日機下方之海面，殆爲硝烟所蔽，日方先鋒機與第二機衝破彈雨烟壁，勇猛進擊，繼之第三機亦行突入，左方大型空母中央部突出一大火柱，全艦已被熊熊黑烟包圍，繼敵空母復噴出一大火柱，此爲第二批之命中也。較敵戰艦稍大之四萬五千噸級之敵大型制式空母，亦於此第二次之爆發後，即於海面發見，又與敵大型空母起火之同時，右側敵方之中型空母亦噴出冲天之火焰，此殆爲第三機所命中也。敵艦起火後，傾斜航行不久，亦沒於海底，此時敵艦陣型亦漸混亂，當日機欲行飛返調轉機首時，更望見右側敵方之大型巡洋艦一艘，竟被大火包圍，此戰友所獲之戰果證實後，即安返基地。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地二十七日中央社電　日神風特別隊，二十五日晨在呂宋島東方海面截擊空襲菲律賓東北部之敵機動部隊，施以必死必中之攻擊，曾擊沉其大小型航空母艦及巡洋艦各一艘，此種偉勳已於二十六日由日大本營發表，其後更判明尚有敵大型航空母艦一艘被炸毀，於是戰果更形擴大，而戰鬬之詳情亦於此判明。蓋當日日空軍特別攻擊隊將轟炸裝置配備於新銳轟炸機「慧星」號及新銳戰鬥機「銀河」號後，即由基地踴躍出發，抵敵機動部隊上空時，即分別排除敵機之妨碍，　撞敵，中型航空母艦各一艘及巡洋艦一艘，爲日機兩架命中炸沉，敵航空母艦一艘亦爲日機一架命中炸毀，是役除特別攻擊隊外，日航空部隊亦參加，至於日方所遭損害，據其後判明，除命中機外，另有十六架未歸返基地。</p>
<h3>陳院長　復謝小磯首相</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央軍　日小磯首相爲紀念汪故主席之遺德及偉業，特電我行政院陳院長，深表哀悼。陳院長已電復表示謝意。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論神風精神</h3>
<p>記得世界上名戰略家克勞維茲說過：「精神重於物質」的話，意思是，單憑物質，沒有精神去發揚物質的長處，那末，物質本身，不會獲得最後勝利，換句話說，精神可以彌補物質上的短處。</p>
<p>戰爭對於一個國家的力量，一個民族的精神，是一個嚴重的考騐，一個民族的精神表現，關係着戰爭的勝敗。一個國家的力量，在戰爭前，在戰爭中，可以用種種方法去刺探它的秘密，而一個民族的精神，則不容估量。所以克勞維茲對估計戰爭勝敗的因素說：「四個因素中，惟有社會因素最難。」什麼是社會因素，便是一個民族的精神。</p>
<p>一種精神，不是臨時抱佛脚所能練成的，也不是隨便所能表現的，盟邦發動大東亞戰爭，在這方面有了久長的準備。敵美侵入台灣菲律賓方面後，日軍航空隊即以一人一機一艦主義，組織神風特別攻擊隊，創前所未有的戰術，建萬世不滅的偉勳。這種戰術，這種偉勳，現在成爲大東亞十億國民精神的總表率，名之曰「神風精神」。</p>
<p>神風隊的誕生，遠在六百七十年前，元兵由蒙古來襲日本，忽起狂風，將元朝船舳吹倒海中，元兵十萬之衆，生還者僅三人而已，故日本名以爲「神風」。此種作戰以少數兵力對多數兵力，達到最後勝利。此次大東亞戰爭中所起之神風即爲神風特別攻擊隊。該隊出發以後，不欲生還，猛烈覆滅敵軍，揚其神風，將敵艦擊滅。</p>
<p>由此我們可以明白，神風精神，起源很早，德富蘇峰氏說：「起碼可以說，奉侍神武天皇御駕東征時的久米，物部以及其他部族，全部鼓吹這一種神風精神，而成爲　國元勳。」日本民族，能保持過去傳統的民族精神，當國家興廢之秋，用最顯明的方式，表現在英美敵人之前，使敵人除了驚訝，畏懼，欽佩以外，一籌莫展。這種人力駕馭之V。一號武器，我們不能等閒視之。</p>
<p>其次，必死信念，是神風精神的最高表現。我們不能視爲「匹夫之勇」，或是不得已的死。即使是，那末，還須有人肯去死，肯去死，就不是平凡的行爲了。何况能一隊繼一隊的連人帶機往敵艦上衝呢？在緊要關頭，置個人生死於度外，爲國犧牲，決不是少數人的義烈，必須全民都有「精忠報國」的決心，才能如此。記得有這樣一首詩歌：「生命誠可貴，愛情價更高，若爲自由故，兩者皆可拋。」神風精神的內容，就是爲自由故。</p>
<p>我們不憚煩的論列這種精神，因爲我們需要這種精神，挽救我們國家民族的危機。幾十年的教育，完全破產，政治不上軌道，社會道德墮落，這些，不是一部分身居高位，以及社會中堅的知識份子，首先喪失了國家觀念，民族思想，而是什麼呢？縱使環境困難，亦不能丟開國民的天職，袖手傍觀；何况再存「混水摸魚」心理，陷國家元氣於萬刦不復境地。我們希望每個同胞，認淸了民族的危機，亟圖復興之道，所以再論神風精神，用意在此。</p>
<p>最後，神風精神，在前綫奠定了大東亞戰爭必勝基礎，我們應該在後方，尤其是在中國後方，發揚神風精神，使中日關係更加親切，更加合理，得貢獻全力，獲得最後勝利。</p>
<h3>日軍精銳部隊　突入貴州省境</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電日大本營二十七日下午六時半發表：（一）日軍於桂林·柳州·陷落後，繼續追擊渝軍。十一月二十四日，攻陷廣西省殘存之美空軍最後據點南寗，其他一部日軍是日突破貴州省南面要衝黎明關，已進入貴州省。（二）中國方面日軍，自九月上旬展開進攻桂林柳州作戰以來，至十一月中旬，佔領該地附近爲止，所獲綜合戰果如次：渝軍損害日軍收容屍體約三萬九千具，俘虜約一萬八千二百名，地上火器擊落渝美飛機七十七架（內未證實者二十三架），鹵獲各式火砲四百十一門，輕重機關槍一千二百四十五挺，步槍約一萬七千挺，飛機十八架，機關車百八輛，鐵路客貨車九百十六輛，汽車及戰車六十二輛，其他兵器彈藥糧珠及飛機零伴等多數，日方損害陣亡者約四千五百名。</p>
<p>廣西前綫二十七日中央社電　日精銳部隊先後佔領思恩河池兩地，復對渝第四戰區軍主力猛加追擊，思恩方面日軍，二十四日晨，抵達廣西貴州省境要衝黎明關東南十公里附近，與渝軍第二十軍展開激戰，即於二十五日晨，迅速突入貴州省境。</p>
<p>中國前綫基地二十七日中央社電　中國戰綫日軍，自九月十四日攻佔全縣後，繼續於湖南廣西展開大攻勢，先後佔領渝軍重大據點柳州·桂林·等地，且仍在擴大戰果中。自全縣攻略後，至十一月二十四日，收獲戰果極大，其中情形奇異者，計渝軍棄屍爲一萬二千五百餘，而被俘者竟達一萬六千餘名，此較衝陽攻略後至全縣佔領前之戰果，遺屍一萬一千三百餘名，俘虜一千五百名，其俘虜數已增至十倍以上，由此可證渝軍戰意已日漸低下。全縣攻略後，至十一月四日之戰果，計渝軍乘屍一二五〇〇，被俘一六一〇〇，鹵獲品計各種砲二九三，（其中火箭式砲十三門），重輕機槍八三四，步檢五九四四，飛機一架，戰車汽車四十上輛，車頭八十四輛，貨客車六百二十九輛。</p>
<h3>日機猛炸　昆明機場</h3>
<p>大陸基地二十七日中央社電　日空軍曾於二十四日夜，利用月光，空襲渝方西南最大基地昆明，經猛烈轟炸後，十二處起火，地上機多架皆被炸毀，日全機安然返防。按昆明機塲，不僅爲中印空路上中國方面之最大基地，更爲渝美空軍自桂林·柳州·南寗·等地，撤退之一大收容基地，其軍事價值，亦因之增大，故最近顯示異常活躍。當日空軍轟炸該地時，尚見滑走路附近，停有比翼相連之大小飛機百數十架於塲內，信號燈輝惶照耀之下，該基地全貌，已覽無餘，故所獲戰果極大。</p>
<p>華南前綫某基地二十七日中央社電　日軍於突入南寗時，即佔領渝美空軍廣西最後據點南寗機塲，該機塲位於南寗東北約三十公里，渝美軍恐懼日軍猛烈攻擊，南寗告危，乃於十九日下午二時，開始撤退，幷將南北補助滑翔路，並附屬設施，悉數破壞。然其主要滑翔路則幸免破壞，仍可使用。</p>

<h3>日駐印公使　人選銓衝中</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日政府決定派駐印度臨時政府之使節，必爲公使級，通曉南洋情勢之老練外交家，聞日外務省方面現正愼重銓衡人選中，鮑斯主席離日前，或可正式發表。</p>
<p>仰光二十七日中央社電　日政府對自由印度臨時政府派遣外交代表，乃日本與各國協力建設大東亞眞意之表現，予僑緬印人衝動殊深。印度臨時政府宣傳部長二十六日發表聲明如次：田政府與自由印度臨時政府，決定交換代表，乃强化兩政府間之協力親善關係，自由印度臨時政府對戰爭之努力益趨顯著，與日政府之協力益加繫密。</p>
<h3>敵機昨午空襲　日關東等地　重要設施並未受損害</h3>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　日大本營二十七日下午七時發表：敵B29型機約四十架，二十七日下午一時許，分散來襲關東，東海道及近畿南部，從密雲上施行濫炸，惟日方損害輕微，重要設施並未被害。</p>
<p>東京二十七日中央社電　馬里亞納基地之敵B29型機隊，二十六日晚間雖遭日航空部隊之攻擊，致重要基地塞班機塲遭受重創，但二十七日又以B29型機約四十架來襲日本本土，作無差別之轟炸。是日敵機分作數隊，以高度侵人日本之關東，東海道及近畿南郊，於密雲之上散亂投下炸彈及燒夷彈，目的純在收獲神經戰之效果，但日方之重要設施未受任何損害，僅若干民衆及公共建築物微受損害。東京都內之神社及學校亦有炸彈投下，近畿地方一部有敵機侵入，但未飛近大阪，神戶等重要地區，僅對南部之山地及海中胡亂投下炸彈，日方毫無損失。東海道地區亦無損害，日制空部隊曾立即出動迎擊，惜以天氣惡劣，行動受若干限制，戰果不明。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰日軍猛攻　對敵展開殲滅戰　薩馬島西海岩日軍夜襲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十七日中央社電　雷伊泰島馬那嘎那歇方面敵軍的五百名，獲運輸機補給食糧，穿過寒林，企圖切斷日軍後路，當遭日軍猛攻，現正展開殲滅戰。</p>
<p>馬尼刺二十七日中央社電　雷伊泰島卡里加拉西南方，日守軍冒敵方熾烈砲火，勇猛抵抗，十二日至十七日間，斃敵甚多，擊退敵軍一隊。塔加米方面，敵軍十六日以來，發動攻勢，遭日軍埋伏攻擊，斃敵百零三名。</p>
<p>馬尼刺二十七日中央社電　薩馬島（雷伊泰島北方）方面之日軍，爲響應雷伊泰島日軍，自本月十一日以來，正猛攻進出於薩馬島西海岸比那班克達（馬開達灣東方）之敵。十四日日軍敢行夜襲，斃敵達五十名之多，使敵極爲震驚，目下敵軍僅維持卡爾比卡陣地，已喪失積極進攻之意圖。又東海岸方面之敵軍，似亦無進攻之意矣。</p>
<p>東京防空體制　淩駕世界都市</p>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美國戰時宣傅局二十六日發表聲明，謂空襲東京爲難事中之難事，國民於接獲空襲東京之消息，萬勿狂喜，其聲明要旨如次：謂東京完全爲木造房屋，一經投放燒夷彈，即可全部化爲灰燼者，完全誤謬，據陸軍方面之報告，東京之防火組織極爲健全，更具有凌駕全世界各大都市之防空體制。東京全市不僅高射砲陣地林立，週圍且爲密機塲所包圍，東京與柏林，科隆具備堅强之防衛力量。火災對日本人之威脅最大，故防火組織極健全，尤目大地震之後，東京新都市道路極其寬闊，於此即能發揮防火效能，且以日本有充分時間研究德國被炸詳情，故東京對大規模之轟炸，於物質上，精神上均有充分之準備。</p>
<p>美轟炸隊司令　承認空襲困難</p>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　據美聯社塞班基地電，美第二十一爆擊機隊司令官漢賽爾，十五日就空襲東京實情及B29型機一架被撞擊落事宣稱：於日本本土附近海面，曾有日方戰鬥機一架，靠近B29型機一架之機尾，該B29型機砲手當即發射機關砲及機槍，同時其他美機亦對該日機猛加攻擊，是時該機砲手突停止射擊，似中彈死傷，日機及對該機猛撞，故我機機尾爲之粉碎，墜入海中，此次除以空襲東京爲滿足外，未能安全達到目的，由此觀之，今後前途當更趨困難。</p>

<h3>盟邦人士同情　中執會宣言</h3>
<p>南京二十七日中央社電　國民黨中執委會爲汪主席逝世，特於日前召開臨時全會，發表宣言，表明繼承汪故主席遺志，繼續努力，國內外各方對此，莫不極爲重視。在華盟邦人士方面，僉認國民黨爲中國國民革命之唯一領導者，亦爲中國政治力推進之中樞，故對國民黨之活躍，向極期待，而對此次之宣言，尤表示滿腔共鳴。記者於二十七日曾分訪首都日本方面有力人士，叩詢感想，茲綜合各方所談如次：</p>
<p>國民黨在此次宣言中，已明示全面和平尚未成功，全黨同志決心繼承注故主席之遺志，努力推進全國統一。並指出中國現在分爲寗渝兩方面，前者與日本合作，後者勾結英美，互相對立。由此關聯，吾人常追憶國父孫先生在神戶對日人之演講，當時孫先生在演講中，曾關明大亞洲主義，此外又曾謂，無日本亦無中國，中國亡則日本亦亡，以此而有中日同胞之論。</p>
<p>國父在演說中並謂，中國一方須與日本作精神之結合，有如兄弟之提携，一方與日本作經濟之協力，國父之方針，以中日兩國爲亞洲之中心，爲開發經濟，曾言亦與美國協力，然今日渝方續作抗日政策，乃形成南京與日本合作，重慶與美國勾結之不幸事態。</p>
<p>吾人爲細究國父所定中日。中美合作之眞意何在，則無論在和平地區或抗戰地區之中國人士，甚盼能再加反省，如以中美之物資合作來對日抗戰，使國家陷於分裂，且日趨惡劣，如此不僅國民受其所害，即國父在天之靈，當亦爲之不安。國父在砷戶演講之時，曾聯俄容共，作暫時的政策，一面與日本作精神之提携，冀能復典亞洲，保持世界和平</p>
<p>重慶爲抗戰而勾結共黨，表面上似倣照國父之聯俄容共政策，實際抹殺自已良心，故弄詭辯，蓋國父爲實現中國之革命，採取容共政策，然北伐成功，淸算此政策者，即爲蔣介石本人，今重慶爲抗戰而渝共合作，結果對抗戰旣毫無效果，反促使重慶本身之弱化。</p>
<p>此次因美國干涉，浩成重慶內部改組，尤其其陳立夫。陳果夫。等CC圑之中心勢力，亦爲共產黨抨擊，故美政府之支援共黨驅逐陳立夫等，業已成功。由美共合作，乃使重慶屈服。觀以上事實，再覲此次國民黨之臨時全會宣言，逆料當能促重慶充分反省，當汪故主席所未能實現之遺志，全國和平統一與反共兩大政策，實爲中國當前絕對須要解決之問題。國民黨曾於此已表明其明確之態度，吾人對此，實不禁深爲同情。</p>
<h3>德軍「鬼師團」西綫屢建戰功　美坦克隊侵入薩爾區</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊，軍息：維特希姆將軍統率之著名「鬼師團」，在西綫南段之戰事中又獲勝利。該師於十日內擊毀美坦克與裝甲車一百六十九輛，俘獲一六·〇〇〇人。</p>

<h3>蘇軍圍攻洪都　德軍退出哈特文</h3>
<p>柏林二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍現又在多瑙河東岸增加壓力，蘇軍除自東南北三方進迫布達佩斯外，現更圖自西方抵達該城，洪牙利西部所遭之威脅亦甚明顯。雨部爭奪多瑙河橋頭之戰事益趨激烈，蘇軍派遣援軍渡越多瑙河，戰事現已延及特拉夫河口以北之地區，蘇軍之進攻已被阻於波杜爾傑東南，該地雙方曾換手至數次之多。布達佩斯以東發生爭奪哈特文（Hatvan）之大戰，該地位於布達佩斯與埃格（Eger）間之中途，德軍於晚間奉令退出該城之殘墟，佔領該城以西較短之陣綫。</p>
<h3>神風精神</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>神風精神，並不是拱手引頸以待神風吹來的意思。乃是指本身要當神風，或當神風的一部份，而吹得敵人屁滾尿流，吹得敵人四零五散，吹得敵人消形匿跡的意思。換言之，現在菲律賓羣島上日夜在工作着的神風特別攻擊隊，就是眞的活標本。</p>
<p>現在還有人在侃侃而談將有神風救難，或無神風救難一類的話，還有人在談應否祈禱神風的爭論。但這類口舌，都是徒費精神的。當然神風一定會吹的，也應當祈禱吹神風的。但先決問題，是要自己常神風的頭，或常神風的一部份，而完成神風的任務。在蒙古入寇時，也完全是這樣。後來，許多國難，也都是按這樣情形進行的。就是說：如祈求神明保佑，只要盡人事，一定會如願以償的。在神明保佑之前，欲使神明保佑，則第一個主要條件就是盡人事。因此，吾儕的祈禱，不要徒托空言，而要作實行的祈禱。所以神風特別攻擊隊的行動之類，實際上可以說是對神明的一個大祈禱。在這樣意義上，不佞冒昧代表一億國民，謹向我們特別攻擊隊致最大的謝意。</p>
<p>神風羣與神風精神</p>
<p>約在七十年前在肥後熙本曾有過神風羣。他們對於當時的形勢，擬表示一大抗議；而完成尊王攘夷的志願，結果爆發了一個大的事變：彼輩二百人幾乎百分之九十九全爲信仰而犧牲。當時社會人士，如不能說是全體，但總能說大部份，都議誚他們冥頑不靈。然而時至今日，對於他們的行爲姑且不論，但他們的精神，却是無人不加以佩服的。溯本求源來說，他們就是大東亞聖戰的鼻祖。在這一點上來看，與其把他們當作時代落伍而失敗，（莫如說他們是因過於前進而失敗，這決不是牽强附會的一種說法。不佞特此把他們引來，就是認爲他們是實際神風精神的體現化</p>
<p>神風精神起自神代</p>
<p>或許有人認爲這種神風精神是由武士道養成的，但事實決非如此。所謂武士道不過是封建時代的產物，目的在對封建君主，使臣下武士盡忠盡節而已。因此忠義是對豢養自己主人的一種行爲，而往往濫用了許多大義名分。本來獎勵士道者中，前有山鹿素行，後有吉田松隂，這兩位先生所講的士道，的確耀如白畫，大義凜然，歸根結底，而是對天皇而言，其他的士道論者，則反對這一點。總之，此種神風精神，並非封建時代的物產，亦非戰國時代的產物，而是與皇國同時發生的，所以說淵源起自神代。起碼可以說，奉侍神武天皇御駕東征時的久未，物部以及其他部族，全都鼓吹這一種神風精神，而成爲榮國元勳。所以，我們與其單說武士一個階級，而農工商三階級除外的武士道是支持皇國，發揚皇威於海外的原動力，則莫如說神風精神是支持皇國，發揚日本皇威於海外的原動力。</p>
<p>大和民族的勇氣，凡知道大和民族者，無人不曉得。只是對於這一勇氣的發生根源，模糊不淸，而只曉得日本國民是勇敢的國民，但忽略了溯本求源。講神風精神，就不能不講皇民道。講卑民道，就不能不講皇民的勇武。講皇民的勇武，就不能不再講皇民的忠誠。日本人並非原來就像猛獸般的勇者。他們一心對於皇室忠義，於是方發生神風精神。就是「前額雖無敵箭」，後背亦不許有敵箭」的精神，「海上有溺屍，山中有棄屍，唯有大君之傍方死得其所」的精神，這全是天津日嗣對皇子一心忠義的自然流路。勇，有五花八門的種類。　勇，慾勇，貪勇，暴勇，僞勇，野勇等是也，但日本國民的勇，乃是忠勇。這就是說，只對於至尊盡忠，而萬死不辭的勇。在這一意義上，追隨神武天皇御駕東征，戰死於孔舍衙坂者，於奏川高唱七生報國赤誠的楠木正成，日俄戰爭時的橋中校，閉塞隊時的廣瀨中校，最近大東亞戰爭陸海軍的一切勞苦功高者等等，全都息息相關，脈脈相通，貫穿盟三千年來的優秀傳統。</p>
<p>神勇與獸勇之差</p>
<p>我們也曉得敵國也有相當勇氣。今日的敵人，並非杯弓蛇影，草木皆兵那樣喪魂掉頭的弱者。他們之中也有暴虎憑河般的勇者。但他們的勇氣，是冒險性的，漁利性的，征服性的，好奇性的，賭博性的。例如爲獲得幾萬美金的賞格，而從世界著名的奈亞加拉瀑布上跳下來，或在紐約攀登摩天樓至頂尖，或獵虎獵獅之類的勇氣。比較我們日本神風精神的純忠純誠，無愧於天地神明的忠義一心，眞是相形見絀，不可同日而語。我們不能說敵人胆小如風。只是他們的勇氣，在於利害得失的念頭上，而我們的神風精神，不僅不是和他們有程度或量的差別，而是有本質上的不同。總之，敵人美國的勇氣是獸性的，而我們日本的勇氣是神性的。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭與神風精神</p>
<p>以前明治天皇崩時，英國泰晤士報曾預言說：「日本也即將沒落了吧！」我們日本國民中也有好多人這樣想。同時，自大正末年至昭和初年，這種隠憂的徵兆，甚至出現了。然而昭和六年（一九三一年）九一八事變以來，擴大到昭和十二年（一九三七年）的七七事變，更進而擴大到昭和十六年（一九四一年）的大東亞戰爭，迄於今日，上述的隱憂，一廓而淸。不佞生於孝明天皇的時代，而在明治·大正·昭和三代，是以新聞記者的資格，經常注意着日本國威世運的變遷隆替。明治二十七八年（一八九五—六年）中日甲午之戰，和明治三十七八年〇一九〇五—六年）日俄戰爭時代，帶着一枝筆或在兵士裏，或在接近遝籌帷幄的重臣那裏。就是現在，仍然以年邁之身，不辭勞頓，希望報國恩於萬一。所以總顴三代而得出來的結論，從未有神風精神達到今日的高潮者。過去，敢死隊的組織，決不算少數。十年戰役的拔刀隊，也是敢死隊。爾靈山的白襷隊，也是敢死險。兩度閉塞隊，也都是教死隊。然而像大東亞戰爭這樣開始的，發揚光大的敢死隊，却一次也沒有。尤其到了神風特別攻擊隊，已經不是敢死除了，而是必死隊了。不顧死之將至，而是對着死前進。德國新兵器V一號，並不需要人駕駛而飛落到敵區，但我們日本的神風特別攻擊隊，是人本身和炸彈一同，也可以說是人本身即炸彈，而奔向敵人。古往今來，世界戰爭史上，這樣不怕犧牲的壯烈事實，恐怕只有日本人幹得出，同時也只有現在的日本人幹得出。所謂只有現在這句話，而是對過去而言，至於將來這一神風精神，還要如何發展，是不能推測的。我要特別說一句的，即這種神風特別攻擊隊的壯烈犧牲，並非單純限於皇軍一部份，而皇軍全部（陸海兩軍）都是如此的，日前關上尉在菲律賓的犧牲，還有不久前的阿部中尉在印度洋尼克巴羣島海面上的犧牲，有馮少將在菲律賓東方海面上的犧牲，精神都是一貫的。這類事實，自從大東亞戰爭爆發以來，是不勝枚舉的。</p>
<p>國內亦有神風精神</p>
<p>當然，我們不單希望皇軍有這種神風精神，同時也希望我們日本一億國民也有這種精神。尤其是與前綫有密切關係的軍需生產方面的人，也希望把生產戰士的幹部，和前綫的將士一樣，都用這種神風精神，來鼓勵他們，記載於英雄傳裏。換言之，勿使前綫的將士白白死去，而要拋去一切利害得失的顴念，要迅速補足生產前綫所要求的飛機和艦船之質量。總之，爲了充分供給，就只有以神風精神，一心一德，誓死努力。同時，對於當局有司，不佞也這樣希望。（年譯自十一月六日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>赫爾國務卿　年邁退休</h3>
<p>里斯本二十七日中央社電　海通社訊：華盛頓官方宣稱，美國務卿赫爾年已七十三歲，近因健康關係而辭職。赫爾係一九三三年二月即羅斯福當選第一任總統後，受任國務卿之職，赫爾在羅斯福第一任總統任期內，推行促進美大陸經濟政治合作之外交政策，羅斯福當選第二任總統，赫爾亦連任原職，時至此際，美國在美洲稱覇之姿態益爲明顯美國對歐洲開始放棄孤立政策亦始自赫爾，即美國在開戰前以美國軍火交換英國之海軍根據地是也。赫爾且於羅斯福第二任總統任期內，自始即從事使美國捲入對德戰渦而底於成，故赫爾之辭職，實爲羅斯福失一最密切之僚屬</p>

<h3>松平部長揭露　美國制覇野心　已引導起英蘇兩國不滿</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，昨（二十七）日下午二時半，在報道常會席上，就英每日郵報所揭露美總統羅斯福制覇世界之野心，發表談話如次：「據本月十五日英國每日郵報所載華盛頓電，記者唐亦頓揭載羅斯福總統有作世界大總統之企圖，致引起英全國輿論界之批評，並指出羅斯福之野心，凡有三點：其一，爲建造世界强大艦隊，其二，爲制覇世界最大商船，其三，爲掌握全世界民間航空。按美羅斯福總統在參戰前，將國內軀逐艦五十艘讓渡英國，其用意即窺佔英巴牛頓紐芬闌二殖民地，佔用爲基地，果爲所成，嗣後乃將軍隊調赴冰島，佔爲軍事基地。迨至參戰後，美國即在所有之英國殖民地上，建設陸海空使用基地。去歲下半年度，美國參議院，又組織考察團，赴歐洲近東方面，考察美國船業，歴時三月而返，團長李却爾勞澤爾之綜合報告建議三點：（一）美國在國外各地所建設之飛機場，應確保永久使用權，（二）關於國際交通聯絡綫，美國應與英國有同等之權力，（三）關於煤油問題，再加以研究。美國所供給之煤油一部份，應向英國要求負担。此項報吿書提出後，最後又批評英國外交政策之不良，應予以改變，並表示應保護美國權力。本月一日，在美芝加哥舉行之國際航空會議，其目的乃美國要求在國外之航空基地自由使用權，易言之，即美國直接覇握世界航空路綫，大會未開前，已引起頗多不滿，均預料航空會議，難以成爲事實，翌日，蘇聯代表拒絕參加，英國代表對美國所提要求，表示反對，因此會議中雙方僵持，未克確立成效，後英國代表讓步，承認美國要求：（一）美國可利用英國領地，尤其在美洲之英國殖民地航空基地，（二）承認將南美洲及重慶方面爲美國航空之勢力範圍，但會議進行中，已暴露英美兩國隙痕頗爲深刻，於此可見美國之野心，將作進一步之表面化。今英國報章，一方面暴露羅斯福之野心，同時並警吿英國人民，要求國人嚴密注視美國將來之野望，至蘇聯對美國所提之自由航空路綫之使用，不滿原因，實由於蘇領土上向不准任何國家駕機隨便往返。」</p>

<h3>悼頭山翁</h3>

<p>盟邦　士觀山滿三島先生，於上月四日，病逝御殿塲別旣，噩耗傳聞，曷勝驚悼。先生之逝世，殊令吾人痛惜追念不止，蓋先生係日本國家主義運動之領導者，爲日本在野之有力分子，早年於其故鄕（福岡）曾先後創立玄洋社，浪人會，其門人輩出，且均係品德秀優，飽卷博學者，平時專以增加知識，　鍊體魄爲宗旨，以　蔚爲國用，獻身社會。先生性極慷慨，每傾其財產，施捨友人，其在今日所以結有多數盟徒友輩，而爲各方一致崇敬者，蘊此故也。又先生嘗以一布衣屢奉旨人宮，賜以御宴，獲此恩寵，尤關日本之先例。</p>
<p>翁生於一八八五年，適逢明治維新，當初翁即以爲欲挽救東亞之賴勢，必須東亞民族之精　團結，奮發圖强，時值我國革命勃興，先生翊　頗力，中國革命得以成功，實賴先生協助不少。昔國父亡命日本與頭山翁交契至爲，民國十八年，國父奉安，乃不辭跋踄，來華執紼，先生友情之誠擊，精神之偉大，素爲中日兩國人士所稱頌者，決非偶然。翁一生奔走，爲日本社會事業之革新，中日關係之促進，不遺餘力，生前死後，吾人深感友情之偉大，與無限之蒼傷。</p>
<p>自中日事變以還，翁無日不在憂　中，亦無日不以恢復中日和平爲快，大東亞戰爭勃發以來，翁即以在野之身，鼓吹東亞新秩序之建設，以求東亞永久和平基礎之奠定，全面和平迄未實現，當爲先生所遺憾，然吾人決以此爲後死者之實任，追念先生，必努力實踐遺志，貫澈革命初衷，以謀中日兩國進一步之合作，吾人更有待於多數中國革命之友，再進一步，爲復興中華，保衛東亞，作更有效之協力，以慰頭山滿先生在天之靈。（本文原擬在頭山翁追悼特刋發表，因寄到稍遲，補載於此。—編者註）</p>

<h3>電力再度減半之後</h3>
<p>— 周榮海</p>
<p>最近當局再度將電力消費滅半，當此決勝年頭，一切巿民之電力費，自應極力加以節省，然仍有許多疑問之點，當局對此亦曾顧及否？諒衆巿民，亦必有此同感，現爰舉數點公之於後：</p>
<p>（一）舞廳·電影院·咖啡館，及其他一切劇場，一切娛樂塲所，其仍能存在，實在矛盾之至。電影院爲大衆娛樂場所，就一般而講，尚不無有益之處，然在整個上海市內，其數之多，眞所謂比比皆是，故當局有意將電力節省，而增加生產增加戰力，則必須先應從此等娛樂塲所取締起。電影院視其地區分佈，存留其最低限度，而其他娛樂塲所，在此非常時期下，實無存在之必要，實有嚴令其停閉之必要。</p>
<p>（二）對工廠之用電，應仍供給其少量，因爲無論如何，雖然這一個工廠，對戰力增加並無帮助，然至少它究竟是一個生產者，比起那種消耗者的一切娛樂塲所來，總要强得多吧！並且，工廠一停，失業者必定大量增加，在此人浮於事的社會上，　一罪　之路，而造成整個社會之不安。雖然娛樂場所的停的，也同樣可以造成一批人之失業，但其數量之相差，用不着說，當然是很大的，如果生產部門的一切工廠，仍能維持的話，則不難使這批人，去從事生產而工作。</p>
<p>（三）如本月二十四日之規象，電車外開（只一，二路等有數之電車除外，但也只不過開四小時，早上一小時，傍晚二小時）而一切娛樂塲所却均於此一日起恢復營業，這爲一種多麽不合理之現象；電影照常三塲，似乎電力之減少，一點也不及於他們。使一般消費者，仍將盡情加以享受，而一般從事生產者，則往來奔波消耗時間，對生產工作效率降低，其後果相差若是之大耶。</p>
<p>（四）對於電力之節省，當局也應爲巿民適身處地想一想，普通一幢房子一只電表，而上海之房屋，一幢房子，大多不止住一份人家，少者二三家，多者六七家，如電力盡管一而再，再而三的滅下去，在一幢房十之再低限度也不够時，居民只可回復從前不文明時代，點油燈代用了，而在現在百物飛漲的時期下，每斤油的價錢，已可供從前一年的開支了，一個從事薪水階級者，能擔負此重壓嗎？</p>
<p>以上四點，均爲實事實說，如蒙當局諒察，則社會幸甚，巿民幸甚！</p>

<h3>Japanese Submarine Attacks in Eastern Seas off Luzon Island in Coordination, Sinking Enemy Destroyer and Aircraft Carrier with Torpedoes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy Americans suffered losses in the seas off Taiwan, they have been extremely cautious in their use of their mobile task force. When conducting air raids on the Philippines, they shortened the duration and adopted surprise attack tactics. On the 21st, taking advantage of the poor weather in the eastern sea off Luzon, they approached the Philippines again. Around 7:00 AM on the 25th, they launched air strikes on various locations on Luzon Island. Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Units immediately went to search and broke through the enemy's mobile task force fighter groups, delivering fierce bombing. They bombed and sank one enemy large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one large cruiser. Currently, the enemy American fleet has concentrated its forces into three groups, cruising the seas off Luzon. A certain Japanese submarine, responding to the aerial operations, also sailed out on the 25th to intercept. When the enemy had three aircraft carriers, one battleship, and several destroyers acting separately, the submarine launched four torpedoes, one of which sank a destroyer. The other three hit an enemy medium aircraft carrier, causing a massive explosion, presumed to have sunk it as well. After achieving its objective, the Japanese submarine observed the chaotic scene of enemy forces rescuing survivors.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The American mobile task force in the eastern sea off the Philippines has recently shifted from offense to defense. The types of aircraft on their carriers are mostly fighters for defense. This is because, since the naval battles in the Philippine Sea, they have been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Units and other air units, causing them to feel terror. According to the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement on the 25th, since the naval battle in the sea off Taiwan, the total number of American aircraft carriers bombed and sunk has reached fifty-one. From this, one can see the extent of the heavy losses suffered by the enemy Americans. Furthermore, the number of American aircraft attacking Hudson Island has recently decreased sharply. On the 13th, the number of aircraft attacking various locations on the island was 500; on the 14th, about 400; on the 19th, the cumulative number was about 500; and on the 25th before noon, about 200, and in the afternoon, no more than a dozen. Judging from the sharp decrease in the number of attacking aircraft, one can also see the decline in the power of American aircraft carriers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yasukuni Attack Squad Collides with Enemy Ships, Seizing Air Supremacy in Leyte Gulf</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Army Special Attack Unit (Yasukuni Unit) attacked enemy transport convoys in Leyte Gulf on the 26th, setting three large transport ships ablaze. The Yasukuni Unit consisted of three special attack aircraft piloted by Second Lieutenants Maru, Tanigawa, and Sergeant First Class Kinoshita. From 10:40 AM to 10:45 AM on the 26th, they crashed one aircraft each into two enemy large transport ships off Tacloban, causing severe damage and explosions. The other aircraft crashed into an enemy large transport ship north of Taguroban, setting it ablaze. The aircraft of the Yasukuni Unit, commanded by Muraoka, crashed into an enemy large ship south of Manicani Island, also inflicting severe damage and setting it ablaze.</p>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The air war between Japan and the United States in the Philippines has reached its peak. The Japanese Air Force has been suppressing the airspace over the battlefield day and night, and has also been attacking enemy rear supply bases to accumulate combat power, planning a major counteroffensive. By the 22nd, the conditions for battle were ripe, and a fierce offensive was launched to annihilate the enemy air force. On the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th, Japanese air units launched large-scale attacks on the enemy's supply base on Morotai Island, achieving brilliant results. It was reported that on the 22nd, 22 locations on the airfield caught fire, and 17 were destroyed. On the 23rd, three airfields were burned down and three were destroyed. On the 22nd and 23rd, 89 enemy aircraft were destroyed. On the 24th, seven enemy aircraft caught fire. At the same time, the Japanese ground forces on the island coordinated with the air force in fierce attacks, and commando units also became active. Recently, they received reinforcements, and their morale was further boosted, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and rendering several enemy airfields unusable. Another air unit also fiercely attacked enemy aircraft carriers in Leyte Gulf and enemy positions on the island, achieving the following results: (1) In Leyte Gulf, on the 22nd, one transport ship was sunk and one destroyer was destroyed. On the 23rd, one large transport ship and two landing craft were sunk. On the 24th, four transport ships were destroyed. (2) On Leyte Island, on the 24th, seven enemy airfields caught fire, one was destroyed, one anti-aircraft position caught fire, and one fuel depot caught fire. Another Japanese air unit, monitoring the movements of the enemy mobile task force, discovered three groups of mobile task forces in the eastern sea off Luzon Island on the morning of the 25th. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit immediately launched a daytime attack, sinking one large aircraft carrier and one large cruiser. The Japanese Special Attack Unit is continuing its fierce attacks, and the results are expected to expand. Due to the Japanese Air Force's preemptive attacks, the expansion of enemy air combat power has been significantly hampered. The Japanese military is gaining a more advantageous position in controlling the airspace around Leyte, which is crucial for the decisive battle in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Japanese Kamikaze Aircraft "Kotoku Unit" Makes Heroic Crash Amidst the Rain</h3>
<p>Philippine Frontline, 27th (Central News Agency) – Enemy carrier-based aircraft invaded the Manila area in several groups on the morning of the 25th. However, on that day, due to the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit's close combat against the enemy mobile task force in the eastern sea off Luzon Island, the enemy suffered a devastating blow. Their aircraft carriers were unable to accommodate their aircraft and fled eastward in panic. This preemptive attack force, the sixth formation of the Kotoku Unit, consisted of five men and five aircraft with six escort aircraft. The details of the heroic attack are described by Flight Petty Officer First Class Tenjo, the leader of the escort aircraft team, as follows: Shortly after the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit took off, it started to rain. They planned to land over a certain cape, but failed due to the bad weather. The aircraft bravely flew along the planned route. After flying for several hours, the weather gradually cleared. The three armed special attack aircraft flew safely. After a while, the commander's aircraft and other escort aircraft encountered an enemy giant aircraft, and the visibility was completely unclear. Suddenly, dozens of white wakes appeared on the sea surface to the left and front. The team discovered a group of powerful enemy mobile forces advancing southward. The formation was centered around two advanced aircraft carriers in the front and two medium-sized aircraft carriers in the rear, with four battleships and about six cruisers escorting them, and more than a dozen destroyers providing protection. After the Japanese attack aircraft identified their circular formation, they entered a charging stance. The enemy opened fire with all their ships. The sea surface below the Japanese aircraft was almost obscured by gunpowder smoke. The Japanese lead aircraft and the second aircraft broke through the barrage of bullets and smoke and advanced bravely. Then, the third aircraft also broke through. A large pillar of fire erupted from the center of the large aircraft carrier on the left, and the entire ship was surrounded by thick black smoke. Another large pillar of fire erupted from the enemy aircraft carrier, indicating the second hit. The enemy large standard aircraft carrier, slightly larger than an enemy battleship and weighing 45,000 tons, was also seen on the sea surface after this second explosion. At the same time that the enemy large aircraft carrier caught fire, a towering flame erupted from the enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier on the right. This was likely the result of the third aircraft's hit. After the enemy ship caught fire, it tilted and sailed for a short time before disappearing into the sea. At this time, the enemy ship formation also gradually became chaotic. When the Japanese aircraft wanted to turn around and return to base, they saw that one of the enemy large cruisers on the right was surrounded by flames. After confirming the results achieved by their comrades, they safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Japanese Base in the Philippines, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Unit intercepted the enemy mobile task force attacking the northeastern part of the Philippines in the eastern sea off Luzon Island on the morning of the 25th, launching a do-or-die attack, sinking one large and one small aircraft carrier and one cruiser. This great achievement was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 26th. It has since been further determined that one more enemy large aircraft carrier was destroyed, expanding the results of the battle, and more details of the battle have also been clarified. On that day, the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Unit, equipped with bombing devices on the new "Comet" bombers and the new "Galaxy" fighters, enthusiastically departed from the base. When they reached the airspace above the enemy mobile task force, they respectively eliminated the interference of enemy aircraft and crashed into the enemy medium aircraft carriers and one cruiser, which were bombed and sunk by two Japanese aircraft. One enemy aircraft carrier was also hit and destroyed by one Japanese aircraft. The Japanese air unit also participated in this operation in addition to the special attack unit. As for the damage suffered by the Japanese side, it was later determined that in addition to the aircraft that made the hits, another sixteen aircraft did not return to base.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Second Discussion on the Spirit of Kamikaze</h3>
<p>I remember the world-renowned strategist Clausewitz saying: "Spirit is more important than matter." This means that relying solely on material resources without the spirit to promote their strengths will not lead to ultimate victory. In other words, spirit can compensate for material shortcomings.</p>
<p>War is a severe test of a country's strength and a nation's spirit. A nation's spiritual performance is related to the victory or defeat of the war. A country's strength can be explored for its secrets by various means before and during the war, but a nation's spirit cannot be estimated. Therefore, Clausewitz said of the factors estimating the victory or defeat of war: "Of the four factors, the social factor is the most difficult." What is the social factor? It is the spirit of a nation.</p>
<p>A spirit cannot be cultivated by last-minute efforts, nor can it be expressed casually. The allied nations made long-term preparations for launching the Greater East Asia War. After the enemy Americans invaded Taiwan and the Philippines, the Japanese Air Force, based on the principle of "one man, one plane, one ship," organized the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, creating unprecedented tactics and building immortal achievements. This tactic and this achievement have now become the general model of the spiritual of the one billion people of Greater East Asia, known as the "Spirit of Kamikaze."</p>
<p>The birth of the Kamikaze Unit dates back 670 years ago. When the Yuan army came to attack Japan from Mongolia, a sudden storm blew the Yuan Dynasty's ships into the sea. Of the 100,000 Yuan soldiers, only three survived. Therefore, Japan named it "Kamikaze" (Divine Wind). This kind of operation achieves ultimate victory with a small number of troops against a large number of troops. The Kamikaze in this Greater East Asia War is the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit. After the unit departs, it does not intend to return alive, but fiercely destroys the enemy, promoting its Kamikaze spirit and destroying enemy ships.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand that the Spirit of Kamikaze originated very early. Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said: "At the very least, it can be said that the Kume, Mononobe, and other tribes who served Emperor Jinmu's eastern expedition all promoted this kind of Kamikaze spirit and became the founding heroes of the country." The Japanese nation can maintain the traditional national spirit of the past, and when the fate of the country is at stake, express it in the most obvious way before the British and American enemies, leaving the enemy at a loss beyond surprise, fear, and admiration. We cannot take this human-guided V-1 weapon lightly.</p>
<p>Secondly, the belief in certain death is the highest expression of the Spirit of Kamikaze. We cannot regard it as "a fool's courage" or a desperate act. Even if it is, someone must be willing to die. Being willing to die is not an ordinary act. Moreover, how can a team after team rush into enemy ships with people and planes? At a critical moment, putting personal life and death aside and sacrificing for the country is by no means the righteousness of a few people. The entire people must have the determination to "serve the country with utmost loyalty" to do so. I remember there was such a poem: "Life is precious, love is even more valuable, but for the sake of freedom, both can be abandoned." The content of the Spirit of Kamikaze is for the sake of freedom.</p>
<p>We tirelessly discuss this spirit because we need this spirit to save the crisis of our nation and country. Decades of education have completely failed. Politics are not on track, and social morals have declined. Isn't this because some people in high positions and the intellectuals who are the backbone of society have first lost the concept of the country and the idea of the nation? Even if the environment is difficult, one cannot abandon one's national duty and stand by idly; moreover, one cannot have the mentality of "fishing in troubled waters" and plunge the country's vitality into an irrecoverable situation. We hope that every compatriot will recognize the crisis of the nation and urgently seek a way to revive it. Therefore, we discuss the Spirit of Kamikaze again, and this is the purpose.</p>
<p>Finally, the Spirit of Kamikaze has laid the foundation for the certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War on the front lines. We should promote the Spirit of Kamikaze in the rear, especially in the Chinese rear, to make the relationship between China and Japan more cordial and more rational, contribute all our efforts, and achieve final victory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elite Troops Break into Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:30 PM on the 27th: (1) After the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, Japanese troops continued to pursue the Chongqing army. On November 24th, they captured Nanning, the last remaining US Air Force base in Guangxi Province. Another unit of Japanese troops broke through Limingguan, a key point in southern Guizhou Province, on the same day and entered Guizhou Province. (2) Since the start of the offensive operations in Guilin and Liuzhou by the Japanese troops in the China theater in early September until mid-November, when they occupied the area, the overall battle results obtained were as follows: The Chongqing army suffered approximately 39,000 bodies of soldiers recovered by the Japanese army, and approximately 18,200 prisoners were taken. On the ground, 77 Chongqing-US aircraft were shot down (23 of which were unconfirmed). Seized were 411 artillery pieces of various types, 1,245 light and heavy machine guns, approximately 17,000 rifles, 18 aircraft, 108 locomotives, 916 railway passenger and freight cars, 62 automobiles and tanks, and a large number of other weapons, ammunition, grain, and aircraft parts. The Japanese side suffered approximately 4,500 deaths.</p>
<p>Guangxi Frontline, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese elite troops successively occupied Sien and Hechi and fiercely pursued the main force of the Chongqing Fourth War Area. The Japanese troops in the Sien area arrived near Limingguan, a key point on the border between Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces, 10 kilometers southeast of the town, on the morning of the 24th and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chongqing 20th Army. On the morning of the 25th, they quickly broke into Guizhou Province.</p>
<p>Chinese Frontline Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – Since occupying Quanzhou on September 14th, Japanese troops on the China front have continued to launch a major offensive in Hunan and Guangxi, successively occupying major Chongqing army strongholds such as Liuzhou and Guilin, and are still expanding their battle results. Since the capture of Quanzhou until November 24th, extremely large battle results have been obtained. Among the extraordinary circumstances, the Chongqing army abandoned over 12,500 bodies, while the number of prisoners reached over 16,000. Compared to the battle results from the capture of Changyang to before the occupation of Quanzhou, with over 11,300 bodies and 1,500 prisoners, the number of prisoners has increased more than tenfold. This proves that the Chongqing army's will to fight has gradually decreased. From the capture of Quanzhou to the battle results of November 4th, the Chongqing army abandoned 12,500 bodies, 16,100 were captured, and the seized items included 293 artillery pieces of various types (including 13 rocket launchers), 834 heavy and light machine guns, 5,944 rifles, one aircraft, 40 tanks and automobiles, 84 locomotives, and 629 freight and passenger cars.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Bomb Kunming Airport</h3>
<p>Mainland Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force, taking advantage of the moonlight, launched an air raid on Kunming, the largest base in the southwest of Chongqing, on the night of the 24th. After a fierce bombing, twelve locations caught fire, and many aircraft on the ground were destroyed. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. Kunming Airport is not only the largest base on the Chinese side of the China-India air route, but also a major reception base for the Chongqing-US Air Force retreating from Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning. Its military value has also increased accordingly, and it has recently shown unusual activity. When the air force bombed the area that day, it also saw hundreds of large and small aircraft parked wing-to-wing near the runway. Under the shining signals, the entire appearance of the base was fully visible, so the battle results were extremely large.</p>
<p>A certain base on the South China Front, 27th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese troops broke into Nanning, they occupied the Nanning Airport, the last Guangxi base of the Chongqing-US Air Force. The airport is located approximately 30 kilometers northeast of Nanning. The Chongqing-US forces, fearing a fierce attack by the Japanese troops, and with Nanning in danger, began to retreat at 2:00 PM on the 19th, destroying the north-south auxiliary runways and affiliated facilities. However, its main runway was spared from destruction and is still usable.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to India: Selection in Progress</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government has decided that the envoy to be stationed in the Provisional Government of India must be of ambassadorial rank and a seasoned diplomat familiar with the situation in Southeast Asia. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently carefully weighing candidates, and a formal announcement may be made before Chairman Bose leaves Japan.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese government's dispatch of diplomatic representatives to the Provisional Government of Free India is a manifestation of Japan's sincerity in cooperating with various countries to build Greater East Asia, which has deeply moved the Burmese and Indian people living abroad. The Minister of Propaganda of the Provisional Government of India issued a statement on the 26th as follows: "The decision of the Tan government and the Provisional Government of Free India to exchange representatives will strengthen the cooperative and friendly relations between the two governments. The Provisional Government of Free India's efforts in the war are becoming increasingly significant, and its cooperation with the Japanese government is becoming closer."</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Air Raid Kanto and Other Areas in Japan Yesterday Afternoon: Important Facilities Not Damaged</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 7:00 PM on the 27th: Approximately 40 enemy B-29 aircraft scattered and attacked Kanto, Tokaido, and the southern Kinai regions around 1:00 PM on the 27th, carrying out indiscriminate bombing from above the clouds. However, the damage to the Japanese side was slight, and important facilities were not damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – Although the enemy B-29 fleet from the Mariana base was attacked by Japanese air units on the night of the 26th, causing heavy damage to the Saipan airfield, an important base, approximately 40 B-29 aircraft again attacked the Japanese mainland on the 27th, conducting indiscriminate bombing. On this day, the enemy aircraft split into several groups, infiltrated the Kanto, Tokaido, and southern Kinai suburbs of Japan at high altitude, and randomly dropped bombs and incendiary bombs from above the clouds, with the sole purpose of achieving the effect of psychological warfare. However, important Japanese facilities were not damaged in any way, and only some civilians and public buildings suffered minor damage. Bombs were also dropped on shrines and schools in Tokyo. Some enemy aircraft infiltrated the Kinai region, but did not fly near important areas such as Osaka and Kobe, but randomly dropped bombs on the southern mountainous areas and in the sea. The Japanese side suffered no losses. The Japanese Air Defense Force immediately dispatched to intercept, but its actions were somewhat limited due to the bad weather, and the results of the battle are unclear. There was also no damage in the Tokaido region.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Leyte Launch Fierce Offensive to Annihilate Enemy; Japanese Forces Launch Night Raid on West Coast of Samar Island</h3>
<p>Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Five hundred enemy troops in the Managanas area of Leyte Island, supplied with food by transport planes, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's rear lines by passing through the cold forests. They were met with a fierce attack by the Japanese army, and an annihilation battle is now underway.</p>
<p>Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Southwest of Carigara on Leyte Island, Japanese defenders bravely resisted under intense enemy artillery fire. From the 12th to the 17th, they killed many enemies and repelled an enemy unit. In the Tagami area, the enemy launched an offensive on the 16th, only to be ambushed by Japanese forces, resulting in 103 enemy deaths.</p>
<p>Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces in the Samar Island area (north of Leyte Island), in response to the Japanese forces on Leyte Island, have been fiercely attacking the enemy entering and exiting Binabankepta (east of the Macqueda Bay) on the west coast of Samar Island since the 11th of this month. On the 14th, Japanese forces boldly launched a night raid, killing as many as fifty enemies, causing great shock to the enemy. Currently, the enemy is only maintaining the Calbiga position and has lost the intention of actively attacking. It also appears that the enemy on the east coast has no intention of attacking.</p>
<p>Tokyo's Air Defense System Surpasses That of Global Cities</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Office of War Information issued a statement on the 26th, stating that air raids on Tokyo are among the most difficult tasks. Citizens should not be overjoyed upon receiving news of air raids on Tokyo. The gist of the statement is as follows: It is completely wrong to assume that Tokyo is entirely composed of wooden houses and can be completely reduced to ashes by incendiary bombs. According to reports from the Army, Tokyo's fire prevention organization is extremely sound and has an air defense system that surpasses major cities around the world. Not only are high-angle gun positions densely distributed throughout Tokyo, but the city is also surrounded by secret airfields. Tokyo, like Berlin and Cologne, possesses strong defensive capabilities. Fire poses the greatest threat to the Japanese people, so the fire prevention organization is extremely sound. Especially after the Great Earthquake, Tokyo's new urban roads are extremely wide, which will enhance fire prevention effectiveness. Furthermore, Japan has had ample time to study the details of the bombings of Germany, so Tokyo is fully prepared both materially and spiritually for large-scale bombing.</p>
<p>Commander of U.S. Bomber Squadron Admits Air Raids Are Difficult</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to an Associated Press dispatch from a Saipan base, Hansell, commander of the U.S. 21st Bomber Squadron, stated on the 15th regarding the actual situation of the air raids on Tokyo and the downing of a B-29 aircraft: Near the Japanese mainland, a Japanese fighter plane approached the tail of a B-29 aircraft. The B-29 gunner immediately fired machine guns and cannons, and other U.S. aircraft also launched a fierce attack on the Japanese plane. At that time, the gunner of the Japanese plane suddenly stopped firing, apparently hit and injured. The Japanese plane then rammed into the B-29, causing its tail to shatter and fall into the sea. This time, we were not able to safely achieve our objectives beyond satisfying ourselves with the air raid on Tokyo. From this, it can be seen that the future will become even more difficult.</p>
<p>China News Association Sends Telegram of Respect to Acting Chairman Chen</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The China News Association recently sent a telegram to Acting Chairman Chen, saying, "Respectfully to Chen Junjian, Acting Chairman of the National Government: Our association believes that as a founding member of the Party and the nation, you are succeeding to the central leadership, which is what the public expects, and we are overjoyed. This association sincerely expresses its loyalty and will emulate the stars orbiting the North Star, wholeheartedly support you, respectfully send this telegram, and hope you will accept it." The China News Association bows.</p>

After elaborating on the importance of political training work, he pointed out that due to the great responsibility of political training personnel, it is especially necessary to improve their quality.

Finally, he encouraged everyone to work together and intensify their efforts to advance political training work and achieve the mission of defending the nation and securing the people. All those who received instructions were extremely inspired.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – Local military and political leaders from all provinces and cities, who previously came to Nanjing to attend the funeral of the late Chairman Wang, the National Military and Political Conference, and the Provisional Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, have arrived in Nanjing one after another weeks ago. Now that their official duties in Nanjing have been completed, they left Nanjing yesterday and today to return to their posts.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Political Training Department of the Military Affairs Commission, because political training officers from various troops are coming to Nanjing to attend the National Military and Political Conference, Director Zhou convened a discussion meeting in the auditorium of the department at 3:00 PM on the 27th. Various issues regarding strengthening political training work were discussed in great detail.</p>
<h3>Allied Friends Sympathize With Declaration of Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Kuomintang Central Executive Committee held a provisional plenary session a few days ago due to the passing of Chairman Wang, issuing a declaration stating that it would inherit the late Chairman Wang's legacy and continue its efforts. All parties at home and abroad attach great importance to this. Allied friends in China generally believe that the Kuomintang is the sole leader of the Chinese National Revolution and the central pillar for promoting Chinese political power. Therefore, they have always had great expectations for the Kuomintang's activities, and they expressed full resonance with this declaration. On the 27th, reporters interviewed influential figures in the Japanese community in the capital to inquire about their impressions. The following is a summary of what various parties said:</p>
<p>In this declaration, the Kuomintang has clearly indicated that overall peace has not yet been achieved, and all Party comrades are determined to inherit the late Chairman Wang's legacy and strive to promote national unification. It also points out that China is now divided into Nanjing and Chongqing, with the former cooperating with Japan and the latter colluding with Britain and the United States, creating mutual opposition. In this connection, we often recall National Father Sun's speech to the Japanese people in Kobe. In that speech, Mr. Sun explained Pan-Asianism and also stated that without Japan, there would be no China, and if China perishes, Japan will also perish, thus establishing the theory of Chinese and Japanese compatriots.</p>
<p>In his speech, National Father also stated that China must form a spiritual union with Japan, like brothers helping each other, and an economic collaboration with Japan. National Father's policy was to make China and Japan the center of Asia and to cooperate with the United States to develop the economy. However, Chongqing's continued policy of resisting Japan has created the unfortunate situation of Nanjing cooperating with Japan and Chongqing colluding with the United States.</p>
<p>We hope that Chinese people in both peaceful and war-torn regions will further reflect on the true meaning of National Father's Sino-Japanese and Sino-American cooperation. Using American material cooperation to resist Japan is causing the country to be divided and deteriorating. This is not only harmful to the people, but also makes National Father's spirit in heaven uneasy. When National Father gave his speech in Kobe, he temporarily adopted a policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists, while spiritually uniting with Japan, hoping to restore Asia and maintain world peace.</p>
<p>Chongqing's collusion with the Communist Party for the sake of resisting Japan superficially imitates National Father's policy of alliance with Russia and tolerance of the Communists, but in reality, it obliterates its own conscience and engages in sophistry. National Father adopted the policy of tolerance of the Communists in order to realize the Chinese Revolution, but Chiang Kai-shek himself liquidated this policy after the success of the Northern Expedition. Now, Chongqing is cooperating with the Communists for the sake of resisting Japan, but this has no effect on the resistance war and instead promotes Chongqing's own weakening.</p>
<p>This time, due to American intervention, Chongqing's internal reorganization has become chaotic, especially the core forces of the Chen Lifu and Chen Guofu CC clique, which have also been attacked by the Communist Party. Therefore, the US government's support for the Communist Party to drive out Chen Lifu and others has been successful. US-Communist cooperation has forced Chongqing to submit. Considering the above facts and reviewing the declaration of the Kuomintang's provisional plenary session, it is expected that it will prompt Chongqing to fully reflect. The two major policies that the late Chairman Wang failed to realize – national peace and unification and anti-communism – are essential issues that China must resolve. The Kuomintang has already expressed its clear attitude on this, and we cannot help but deeply sympathize with it.</p>
<h3>German "Ghost Division" Repeatedly Achieves Military Successes on the Western Front; American Tank Units Invade Saar Region</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Military news: The famous "Ghost Division" led by General Weitersheim has achieved another victory in the southern sector of the Western Front. The division has destroyed 169 American tanks and armored vehicles and captured 16,000 prisoners in ten days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Military news: A powerful American tank column on the northern flank of the Lorraine battle has penetrated further into the Saar region. Although the enemy has achieved initial success, it has ultimately been contained by German forces. American tanks and motorized units in the Strasbourg area continue to exert pressure southward between the Rhine and Vosges rivers, making slight gains.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Besiege Hatvan; German Forces Withdraw From Hatvan</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Soviet forces are now increasing pressure on the east bank of the Danube River. In addition to advancing on Budapest from the east, north, and south, the Soviet forces are now attempting to reach the city from the west, and the threat to western Hungary is becoming increasingly apparent. The battle for the Danube bridgehead is intensifying, with Soviet forces sending reinforcements to cross the Danube River. The battle has now extended to the area north of the Trave River estuary. The Soviet advance has been stopped southeast of Bodulje, where control of the area has changed hands several times. A major battle for Hatvan has broken out east of Budapest. Hatvan is located midway between Budapest and Eger. German forces were ordered to withdraw from the ruins of the city in the evening, occupying a shorter line of defense west of the city.</p>
<h3>Kamikaze Spirit</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>The kamikaze spirit does not mean waiting with folded hands for the divine wind to blow. It means becoming the kamikaze oneself, or a part of the kamikaze, blowing the enemy away in a chaotic mess, scattering them, and making them disappear without a trace. In other words, the kamikaze special attack units that are working day and night in the Philippine Islands are the true living examples.</p>
<p>Even now, some people are still talking侃侃and談 about whether the kamikaze will come to save them or not, and there are still people debating whether or not to pray for the kamikaze. But this kind of talk is a waste of energy. Of course, the kamikaze will definitely blow, and we should pray for the kamikaze to blow. But the prerequisite is to always be the head of the kamikaze, or a part of the kamikaze, and complete the kamikaze's mission. This was exactly the case when the Mongols invaded. Later, many national crises were also handled in this way. That is to say: If you pray for the protection of the gods, as long as you do your best, your wishes will definitely be fulfilled. Before the gods protect you, if you want the gods to protect you, the first and most important condition is to do your best. Therefore, our prayers should not be empty words, but practical prayers. Therefore, the actions of the kamikaze special attack units can actually be said to be a great prayer to the gods. In this sense, I humbly represent one hundred million citizens in expressing my greatest gratitude to our special attack units.</p>
<p>Kamikaze Group and Kamikaze Spirit</p>
<p>About seventy years ago, there was a kamikaze group in Higo, Kumamoto. They intended to express a major protest against the situation at the time; and to fulfill their aspiration of revering the emperor and expelling the barbarians, resulting in a major incident: almost 99% of the two hundred people sacrificed themselves for their beliefs. At the time, social figures, if not all, but the majority, criticized them for being stubborn and inflexible. However, even if we don't talk about their actions, their spirit is admired by everyone today. Tracing back to the source, they are the ancestors of the Greater East Asia Holy War. From this point of view, rather than regarding them as outdated and failing (it would be better to say that they failed because they were too far ahead. This is definitely not a far-fetched argument). I am specifically mentioning them because I believe that they are the embodiment of the actual kamikaze spirit.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze Spirit Originated in the Age of Gods</p>
<p>Perhaps some people think that this kamikaze spirit was fostered by the samurai code of conduct, but the truth is not so. The so-called samurai code of conduct is nothing more than a product of the feudal era, with the purpose of making vassal samurai devote their loyalty to feudal lords. Therefore, loyalty and righteousness are actions towards the masters who take care of them, and they often abused many great-sounding titles. Among those who originally promoted the samurai code of conduct, there were Yamaga Sokō in the past and Yoshida Shōin later. The samurai code of conduct that these two gentlemen spoke of was indeed as clear as daylight and full of righteousness. Ultimately, it was addressed to the Emperor. Other samurai code of conduct theorists opposed this point. In short, this kamikaze spirit is not a product of the feudal era, nor is it a product of the Warring States period, but it occurred at the same time as the imperial country, so it can be said that it originated in the age of gods. At the very least, it can be said that Hisae, Mononobe, and other tribes who served Emperor Jimmu during his eastward expedition all promoted this kamikaze spirit and became meritorious founders of the nation. Therefore, rather than simply saying that the samurai, a single class, excluding the farmers, artisans, and merchants, supported the imperial country and promoted its power overseas, it would be better to say that the kamikaze spirit supported the imperial country and promoted the power of the Japanese emperor overseas.</p>
<p>The courage of the Yamato race is known to all who know the Yamato race. It's just that the origins of this courage are vague, and people only know that the Japanese people are brave people, but they neglect to trace back to the source. To talk about the kamikaze spirit, one must talk about the way of the imperial people. To talk about the way of the imperial people, one must talk about the bravery of the imperial people. To talk about the bravery of the imperial people, one must talk about the loyalty of the imperial people. The Japanese people were not originally brave like wild beasts. They were single-mindedly loyal to the imperial family, and thus the kamikaze spirit arose. It is the spirit of "even if there are no enemy arrows in front, there must be no enemy arrows in the back," the spirit of "there are drowned corpses in the sea, and there are abandoned corpses in the mountains, but one can only die by the side of the great lord," which is all a natural outflow of single-minded loyalty to the imperial successor. Courage has many different kinds. There is courageousness of desire, courageousness of greed, courageousness of violence, courageousness of hypocrisy, courageousness of wilderness, etc. But the courage of the Japanese people is loyal courage. That is to say, it is the courage to be loyal to the supreme and not be afraid to die. In this sense, those who followed Emperor Jimmu on his eastward expedition and died in battle at Kongosa-zaka, Kusunoki Masashige who sang the red sincerity of repaying the country seven times at Minatogawa, Colonel Hashinaka during the Russo-Japanese War, Lieutenant Commander Hirose during the blockade operation, and all the hard-working and meritorious people of the army and navy during the recent Greater East Asia War are all closely related, spiritually connected, and inherit the excellent traditions of three thousand years.</p>
<p>The Difference Between Divine Courage and Bestial Courage</p>
<p>We also know that the enemy country also has considerable courage. Today's enemies are not weaklings who lose their souls and turn their heads at the sight of a bow in a cup or soldiers in the grass. Among them, there are also those who are brave like striking tigers and wading across rivers. But their courage is adventurous, opportunistic, conquering, curious, and gambling. For example, jumping off the world-famous Niagara Falls or climbing a skyscraper in New York to the top, or hunting tigers and lions for a reward of tens of thousands of US dollars. Comparing it to the pure loyalty and pure sincerity of our Japanese kamikaze spirit, the single-minded devotion to loyalty and righteousness that is worthy of heaven and earth and the gods, it is truly inferior and cannot be compared. We cannot say that the enemy is as timid as the wind. It's just that their courage lies in the thought of gains and losses, while our kamikaze spirit is not only different from them in degree or quantity, but also in essence. In short, the courage of the enemy, the United States, is bestial, while the courage of us Japanese is divine.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War and the Kamikaze Spirit</p>
<p>In the past, when Emperor Meiji passed away, The Times of London predicted: "Japan is about to decline!" Many Japanese people also thought so. At the same time, from the end of the Taisho era to the beginning of the Showa era, signs of this hidden concern even appeared. However, since the September 18th Incident in Showa 6 (1931), which expanded to the July 7th Incident in Showa 12 (1937), and further expanded to the Greater East Asia War in Showa 16 (1941), until today, the above-mentioned hidden concerns have been completely eliminated. I was born in the era of Emperor Komei, and in the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa eras, I have always paid attention to the changes in Japan's national prestige and world fortune as a journalist. During the Sino-Japanese War of Meiji 27 and 28 (1895-96) and the Russo-Japanese War of Meiji 37 and 38 (1905-06), I carried a pen either among the soldiers or near the senior officials who were strategizing. Even now, I still hope to repay the nation in any small way, despite my old age and hardship. Therefore, the conclusion drawn from looking at the three generations is that the kamikaze spirit has never reached the climax it has today. In the past, the organization of suicide squads was by no means small in number. The Drawn Sword Squad in the Ten Year War was also a suicide squad. The White Sash Squad of Iwo Jima was also a suicide squad. The two blockade operations were also all suicide squads. However, there has never been a suicide squad that started like this and was promoted like the Greater East Asia War. Especially with the Kamikaze Special Attack Unit, it is no longer a suicide squad, but a "must-die" squad. They do not care about the approach of death, but advance towards death. The German new weapon, the V-1, does not require anyone to pilot it and flies to enemy territory, but our Japanese kamikaze special attack unit is a person themselves and a bomb together, or it can be said that the person themselves is the bomb, and rushes towards the enemy. Throughout history, in the history of world warfare, such a heroic fact of not fearing sacrifice is probably only something that the Japanese can do, and only the Japanese of today can do. The phrase "only now" refers to the past, as for how this kamikaze spirit will develop in the future, it is impossible to predict. I want to say one thing in particular, that the heroic sacrifice of this kamikaze special attack unit is not simply limited to a part of the imperial army, but the entire imperial army (both the army and the navy) is like this. The sacrifice of Captain Seki in the Philippines the other day, and the recent sacrifice of Lieutenant Commander Abe in the sea off the Nicobar Islands in the Indian Ocean, and the sacrifice of Major General Honma in the sea east of the Philippines, are all of the same spirit. These kinds of facts are countless since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The Kamikaze Spirit Also Exists Domestically</p>
<p>Of course, we not only hope that the imperial army has this kamikaze spirit, but we also hope that our one hundred million Japanese people have this spirit. Especially those who are closely related to the front line in military production. We also hope that the cadres who produce soldiers, like the officers and soldiers on the front line, will use this kamikaze spirit to encourage them and record them in the biography of heroes. In other words, do not let the officers and soldiers on the front line die in vain, but abandon all thoughts of gain and loss, and quickly make up for the quality and quantity of aircraft and ships required by the production front line. In short, in order to provide sufficient supplies, we can only work hard with one heart and one mind, vowing to die, with the kamikaze spirit. At the same time, I hope that the authorities will also do so. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, November 6)</p>
<h3>Secretary of State Hull Retires Due to Old Age</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Washington officials announced that U.S. Secretary of State Hull, age 73, has resigned due to health reasons. Hull was appointed Secretary of State in February 1933, after Roosevelt was elected as the first president. During Roosevelt's first term, Hull promoted a diplomatic policy of promoting economic and political cooperation in the Americas. When Roosevelt was elected as the second president, Hull continued in his original position. At this time, the United States' posture of hegemony in the Americas became more obvious. The United States' abandonment of its isolation policy towards Europe also began with Hull, namely the exchange of U.S. armaments for British naval bases before the war. During Roosevelt's second term, Hull also engaged in making the United States involved in the war against Germany from the beginning to the end. Therefore, Hull's resignation is indeed a loss of a closest subordinate for Roosevelt.</p>

<h3>Minister Matsudaira Reveals: America's Ambition to Dominate Has Already Provoked Dissatisfaction from Britain and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the 27th, at 2:30 PM, Minister Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy, speaking at a regular press conference, commented on the ambition of U.S. President Roosevelt to dominate the world, as revealed by the British Daily Mail, as follows: "According to a Washington dispatch in the British Daily Mail on the 15th of this month, reporter Don Iddon revealed President Roosevelt's intention to become the world's president, which has aroused criticism from British public opinion and pointed out three aspects of Roosevelt's ambition: first, to build the world's most powerful fleet; second, to dominate the world's largest merchant fleet; and third, to control civilian aviation worldwide. President Roosevelt, before entering the war, transferred fifty destroyers to Britain, intending to seize the British colonies of Baa-Newton and Newfoundland as bases, which he successfully did. Subsequently, he deployed troops to Iceland and occupied it as a military base. After entering the war, the United States built land, sea, and air bases on all British colonies. In the second half of last year, the U.S. Senate also organized a delegation to Europe and the Near East to investigate the American shipping industry. After three months, the delegation leader, Lee Lutherer, submitted a comprehensive report recommending three points: (1) The United States should secure permanent usage rights for the airfields it has built in various foreign locations; (2) The United States should have equal rights with Britain regarding international transportation lines; and (3) The oil issue should be further studied. A portion of the oil supplied by the United States should be charged to Britain. After the report was submitted, it criticized the poor British foreign policy and suggested that it should be changed, while also emphasizing the need to protect American power. On the 1st of this month, the International Aviation Conference held in Chicago was aimed at the United States demanding free usage rights for aviation bases overseas. In other words, the United States directly sought to control global air routes. Before the conference even opened, it had already aroused considerable dissatisfaction, and it was widely predicted that the aviation conference would not be successful. The next day, the Soviet representative refused to participate, and the British representative expressed opposition to the demands made by the United States. As a result, the two sides were deadlocked in the conference and failed to reach any effective agreement. Later, the British representative yielded and recognized the American demands: (1) The United States could use British territories, especially aviation bases in British colonies in the Americas; (2) It was recognized that South America and the Chongqing area would be within the sphere of American aviation influence. However, the conference proceedings already exposed deep rifts between Britain and the United States, demonstrating the increasing overtness of America's ambitions. Now, British newspapers are exposing Roosevelt's ambitions and warning the British people, urging them to closely monitor America's future aspirations. The Soviet Union's dissatisfaction with the free use of air routes proposed by the United States is due to the fact that no country is allowed to fly freely back and forth over Soviet territory."</p>

<h3>Ancient Porcelain Exhibition: Last Three Days</h3>
<p>Our nation's culture and art originated the earliest. For thousands of years, cultural relics have been brilliant, not only as the embodiment of our national spirit but also as the cornerstone of world cultural evolution. The China Art Museum, based on this principle, has been displaying famous porcelain from various dynasties during its opening period for public viewing. The number of visitors has been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. Individuals such as German Ambassador Wörmann, Consul General Fischer and his wife, as well as numerous middle schools such as Zhonghua, Minguo, Guoqiang, Wuguang, Qingnianhui, Zhonghua, and Guangcheng, have visited, totaling no less than several thousand people. The grand occasion is unprecedented, demonstrating that a love for antiquity is shared by both Chinese and foreigners. Various sectors have praised this exhibition highly. The serene and lofty elegance of the Song and Yuan porcelains, the antique charm of the Ming porcelains, and the dazzling magnificence of the Qing porcelains each represent the artistic spirit of their respective eras and deserve great attention from all parties. This is a unique opportunity to appreciate ancient art. According to the museum, this exhibition of rare treasures is being systematically and meaningfully displayed. Aside from our country's participation in the London Chinese Art Exhibition, this porcelain exhibition can be considered an unprecedented grand event. Do not miss this opportunity.

<h3>Mourning Touyama Mitsuru</h3>
<p>— Ren Yuandao</p>
<p>Mr. Touyama Mitsuru, a patriot of our allied nation, passed away from illness on the 4th of last month at his villa in Gotemba. The news of his death fills us with shock and grief. Mr. Touyama's passing is a great loss, and our thoughts and memories of him will not cease. Mr. Touyama was a leader of the Japanese nationalist movement and a powerful figure outside the government. Early in his career, he founded the Genyosha and Roninkai in his hometown (Fukuoka). His disciples were numerous, all outstanding in character, knowledgeable, and learned. They focused on increasing their knowledge and strengthening their bodies, aiming to serve the country and dedicate themselves to society. Mr. Touyama was extremely generous, often donating his wealth to friends. This is why he had so many loyal followers and friends today and was universally respected. Moreover, Mr. Touyama, dressed in plain clothes, was repeatedly summoned to the Imperial Palace for imperial banquets, an unprecedented honor in Japan.</p>
<p>Touyama was born in 1855, coinciding with the Meiji Restoration. Early on, he believed that to save East Asia, East Asian nations must unite their spirits, strive for progress, and strengthen themselves. When the Chinese Revolution surged, Mr. Touyama provided significant support. The success of the Chinese Revolution relied heavily on Mr. Touyama's assistance. In the past, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, while in exile in Japan, had a very close relationship with Touyama. In 1929, when Dr. Sun was enshrined, Touyama did not hesitate to travel to China to assist in the funeral. Mr. Touyama's sincere friendship and great spirit have been praised by people in both China and Japan, and this is no accident. Throughout his life, Touyama spared no effort in promoting the reform of Japanese society and the advancement of Sino-Japanese relations. In life and in death, we deeply feel the greatness of his friendship and boundless sorrow.</p>
<p>Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, Touyama was constantly worried and hoped for the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Touyama, in his capacity as a private citizen, advocated the construction of a new East Asian order to lay the foundation for lasting peace in East Asia. The full realization of peace has yet to be achieved, which would have been a regret for Mr. Touyama. However, we are determined to take this as our responsibility as survivors, to remember Mr. Touyama, and to strive to fulfill his will and carry out our revolutionary aspirations to promote further cooperation between China and Japan. We also look forward to further efforts from many Chinese revolutionary friends to contribute more effectively to the revival of China and the defense of East Asia, so as to comfort the spirit of Mr. Touyama Mitsuru in heaven. (This article was originally intended for publication in a special issue commemorating Mr. Touyama, but it arrived late and is included here. —Editor's Note)</p>

<h3>After Electricity is Halved Again</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ronghai</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities halved electricity consumption again. During this decisive year, the electricity expenses of all citizens should be saved as much as possible. However, are there still many questions that the authorities have considered? I believe that all citizens must have the same feeling. Now, I will list several points for public discussion:</p>
<p>(1) The continued existence of dance halls, cinemas, cafes, and all other theaters and entertainment venues is extremely contradictory. Cinemas are public entertainment venues, and generally speaking, they still have some benefits. However, in the entire city of Shanghai, their number is truly ubiquitous. Therefore, if the authorities intend to save electricity and increase production and combat power, they must first start by banning these entertainment venues. Depending on their geographic distribution, the number of cinemas should be reduced to the bare minimum, and other entertainment venues have no need to exist during this extraordinary period and should be strictly ordered to close.</p>
<p>(2) A small amount of electricity should still be supplied to factories, because no matter what, even if a factory does not help increase combat power, at least it is still a producer, which is much better than all the entertainment venues that are consumers! Furthermore, if factories close, unemployment will inevitably increase drastically. In this society of oversupply, this will only add to the crime and cause social unrest. Although the closure of entertainment venues can also cause a batch of people to lose their jobs, the difference in the number is naturally very large. If all the factories in the production sector can still be maintained, it will not be difficult for this group of people to engage in production and work.</p>
<p>(3) As in the regulations of the 24th of this month, trams are only operating outside (except for a few trams on routes 1 and 2, etc., but even these only operate for four hours, one hour in the morning and two hours in the evening), while all entertainment venues resumed business from this day. This is a very unreasonable phenomenon; movies are still shown three times a day, as if the reduction in electricity has no impact on them at all. This allows ordinary consumers to continue to enjoy themselves to the fullest, while ordinary producers travel back and forth, wasting time and reducing the efficiency of production work. The consequences are so different.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the saving of electricity, the authorities should also consider the situation of the citizens. An ordinary house has only one electricity meter, and most houses in Shanghai are inhabited by more than one family, from as few as two or three families to as many as six or seven families. If electricity is reduced again and again, and even the lowest limit is not enough for a house, residents can only revert to using oil lamps, as in the uncivilized era. In the current period of soaring prices, the price of oil per *jin* (approximately 0.5 kilogram) can already cover the expenses of one year in the past. Can someone who is employed and earns a salary bear this heavy burden?</p>
<p>The above four points are all factual statements. If the authorities can understand, then society will be fortunate, and the citizens will be fortunate!</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Furen's Birthday: Relatives and Friends' Birthday Celebrations Aid Charity, Donating 100,000 Yuan to Support Our Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Furen, Chairman of the Industrial Oil Industry Association, celebrated his 40th birthday the other day. His relatives and friends held a banquet at the Wanli Restaurant to offer their congratulations, receiving celebratory gifts totaling 200,000 yuan. Mr. Zhang, deeply moved by the difficulties of the times, generously decided to donate the entire amount, along with an additional 150,000 yuan from his personal funds, totaling 350,000 yuan, to various charitable organizations to benefit his relatives and friends. This includes 100,000 yuan each for this newspaper's winter clothing and porridge distribution fund and the Xinwen Bao's student loan fund; 20,000 yuan each for the Tongren Fuyuantang, Xin Puyu Tang, Xujiahui Notre Dame Orphanage, Tongren Charity Association, Renci Charity Association, and Pude Tang; and 30,000 yuan for the China General Relief Association for Women and Children. Mr. Zhang's dedication to public service and his compassionate concern for others are truly admirable.</p>
<p>In addition, a Shanghai "Escaping Citizen" reader generously donated a check for 50,000 yuan, of which 10,000 yuan each was allocated to our newspaper's winter clothing and porridge distribution, small loan fund, and poverty relief fund as a response. The remaining 10,000 yuan each was donated to the Anlao Home and the China Child Welfare Association. Their dedication to public welfare is also commendable. Furthermore, Mr. Hua Shihan sent a letter stating: "To whom it may concern, having read in the newspaper that your esteemed publication is organizing clothing and porridge distribution due to the approaching cold weather, I am deeply impressed by your compassionate concern for relieving the suffering of our compatriots. I am enclosing herewith five Class A and five Class B clothing vouchers from the Buddhist Charity Association. (Each Class A voucher is worth 2,800 yuan for cotton clothing, and each Class B voucher is worth 2,800 yuan for cotton trousers.) Totaling ten vouchers, equivalent to five sets of clothing, I am enclosing them with this letter in the hope that you will accept them and distribute them to impoverished compatriots."</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Fellow-Townsmen Association: Increased Loan Amount</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Fellow-Townsmen Association in this city has been providing small loans for two years. In order to adapt to the current environment, the loan amount has been increased to a maximum of 3,000 yuan. However, due to limited funds, it is not easy to maintain this program. Therefore, a fundraising campaign has been launched. Thanks to the enthusiastic support of fellow-townsmen and colleagues, 300,000 yuan was pledged on the spot. We hope that generous fellow-townsmen and philanthropists will contribute generously to support this endeavor. Those wishing to donate can send their contributions directly to Mr. Zhou Daoqian of the Finance Department at Hefeng Silk Shop in Changxin Lane, Tianjin Road, and obtain an official receipt. Anyone who is genuinely from Zhenjiang and lacks funds can apply at the association's office at No. 3 Zhifu Road, Zhejiang Road, with their household registration certificate.</p>

<p>The World Red Swastika Society, which operates the Mobile People's Vocational Training Center, currently houses over 700 mobile people. Focusing on agricultural and industrial training, they are now conducting leisure education and need various types of books, such as moral books, books on scientific cultivation, and books on general knowledge, for their leisure reading. We respectfully request that philanthropists from all walks of life donate these books to the Shanghai Office at No. 15 Zhonghe Village, Pushi Road.</p>

<h3>Child Welfare Association Appeals for Donations, Hoping All Sectors Generously Contribute</h3>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, in order to carry out the educational work for over 300 orphans, is currently conducting a fundraising campaign with a goal of 5 million yuan, aiming to complete it within one month. Since the start of the fundraising on the 11th of this month, nearly half a month has passed, and a total of over 1.45 million yuan has been received, demonstrating the enthusiastic response and generous contributions from all sectors. After all, rescuing orphaned and destitute children is fulfilling humanity's mutual assistance obligation, and it is also fulfilling the responsibilities we should bear towards the country and society. However, the donations currently received by the association are still far from the target. It is hoped that all sectors will continue to act with benevolence and make further generous contributions so that the association can achieve its goal as soon as possible to benefit the orphans.</p>
