<h3>特稅舞弊案善後問題</h3>
<p>前第一區公署特稅處職員舞弊一案，經</p>
<p>揭發以後，引起各界嚴切注意。我們在十五</p>
<p>日短評中略論及之。頃聞市政當局及主管部</p>
<p>分對於是案中主從各犯，決嚴密偵查，依法</p>
<p>處治，特稅科長巳於咋日扣押，全案案情想</p>
<p>不久即可公告於社會。</p>
<p>財政需要整理，稅收需要整頓，在市政</p>
<p>刷新工作中，最感迫切需要，因為財政是庶</p>
<p>政之母，各項行政的推進，莫不需要財政為</p>
<p>動力。我們對於這次舞弊案件的善後問題，</p>
<p>再貢管見數點如次：</p>
<p>第一，此項舞弊案件，由來已久，積習</p>
<p>頗深，聞內幕組織亦相當嚴密。因此，牽涉</p>
<p>的方面頗廣，偵查時必須超然無私，將來全</p>
<p>案撒查明百以後，對於主從人犯，各處以應</p>
<p>得罪刑以外，必須將主犯的財產全部充公沒</p>
<p>收，以為其他舞弊者戒。</p>
<p>第二，一面對於是案秉公澈查，同時，</p>
<p>積極方面主管當局對於徵收特稅，迅速編製</p>
<p>整個改革方案，這方案的要領，不着眼於枝</p>
<p>節問題或局部改革，而注意於通盤籌劃，一</p>
<p>方面使納稅者無法逃避捐稅，一方面消減作</p>
<p>弊機會，使經手人員無法活動。徵稅辦法愈</p>
<p>公開愈好，徵稅手續愈簡單愈好，辦法公開</p>
<p>，使納稅者充分明瞭，經收者無從隱瞞。手</p>
<p>續簡單，使經收者不易取巧作弊。</p>
<p>第三，徵稅機構的人事，最應重視，主</p>
<p>持人選，不必以辦稅收稅之經騐為任甩原則</p>
<p>，而應以社會公認可靠人選，或由深具歷史</p>
<p>的工商團體推荐最可靠人選担任。一般辦事</p>
<p>人員的待遇，必須提高，减少非法活動的動</p>
<p>第四，糟核工作，寓有超然神聖性質，</p>
<p>除主管機關負責人以外，凡有關機關如財政</p>
<p>部稅務署以及市政諮詢會等，其次，工商界</p>
<p>如市商會，銀錢業公會等均應派員參加，共</p>
<p>同審核。</p>
<p>第五，工商界也應自肅。一部分特稅處</p>
<p>職員的舞弊，大都與商店勾結。往往商店主</p>
<p>人為减輕負担，不肯提高店員待遇，乃利用</p>
<p>消費特稅易於偷漏，故意放任店員與收稅人</p>
<p>員勾結作弊，以逃避之捐稅，貼補店員生活</p>
<p>費。今後對於工商界逃稅，亦應規定嚴重罰</p>
<p>則。</p>
<p>最後，希望納稅人與當局合作，協助防</p>
<p>範商店作弊，過去一部分小規模商店，售出</p>
<p>貨物不予發票，而捐稅照收，如加詢問，則</p>
<p>云特稅已經包納，顯然作弊偷稅，應由當局</p>
<p>嚴令商店售出貨物應給發票，記明稅額，納</p>
<p>稅人對於商店收稅而不給記明稅額之發票，</p>
<p>予以拒絕或吿發。</p>
<h3>迭尼安大宮兩島日守軍奮戰創敵　屢施奇襲使敵無喘息機會</h3>
<p>中部太平洋二十日中央社電迭尼安島及大宮島之日軍，在天然</p>
<p>之防衛下，實予敵軍甚大損失，目下仍在繼續抗戰中。十八日夜曾見迭</p>
<p>尼安島之照明彈約五十發，大宮島約十發，相互交錯，戰鬥之熾烈可見</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十日中央社電大宮島日軍自七月二十一日美軍登陸</p>
<p>以來，已經一月，始終以寡兵與敵奮戰，目下日美兩軍戰綫仍極錯雜，</p>
<p>到處展開亂戰。泰晤士雜誌從軍記者十七日由無綫電台廣播該島登陸之</p>
<p>美軍，遵受日軍凄絕之抵抗情形，謂較之塞班島尤為激烈。其要旨如次</p>
<p>：大宮島作戰之困難，實出預料之外。此次登陸作戰，哈爾賽指揮之美</p>
<p>太平洋第五艦隊之大部及第三水陸兩用部隊均行參加，同時美海軍第三</p>
<p>師亦自奧羅迭港北方阿桑皮阿迭台普灣中間登陸，參加戰鬥。日軍之反</p>
<p>擊極猛烈，尤以夜襲戰更甚，故美軍戰死及行蹤不明者，每日約在百五</p>
<p>十人以上，此實不次於塞班島作戰時。為救援此種困難局面，不得不使</p>
<p>陸軍第七十七師團登陸應援，戰鬥目下依然繼續中。日軍之抵抗未衰，</p>
<p>更不容美軍有所懈怠，美海軍與到處憑恃堅固陣地頑強抵抗之日軍小部</p>
<p>隊，不得不展開毫無休息之戰鬥。</p>
<p>馬利亞納海面日潛水艇戰果</p>
<p>太平洋日軍基地二十日中央社電</p>
<p>馬利亞納羣島方面之日潛艇，克服一。</p>
<p>切　戰之困難，恃其隱密性，擊沉敵</p>
<p>艦甚多。六月十六日距大宮島二萬五</p>
<p>千米向陸上射擊之敵四萬五千噸最新戰艦，經日潛艇白畫之奇襲，瞬即</p>
<p>沉沒。</p>
<p>又敵艦進襲馬利亞納</p>
<p>羣島時，日潛艇於羅特島</p>
<p>西方約百公里之處，發現</p>
<p>敵戰艦羣及航空母艦羣所</p>
<p>組成之機動部隊，因最近</p>
<p>「電波探知器」及「水中</p>
<p>聽音器」發達關係，難以</p>
<p>接近敵艦，然日潛艇不顧</p>
<p>一切，向敵艦羣中央一母</p>
<p>艦衝去，突破敵艦羣之最</p>
<p>重警戒，然日潛水艇更欲</p>
<p>於進達相當距離時，施用</p>
<p>肉搏戰，僅以潛望鏡把握</p>
<p>目標，對敵「華斯普」型</p>
<p>之大型航空母艦（按華斯</p>
<p>普號於民國三十一年八月</p>
<p>十五日被日潛水艦學沅，</p>
<p>此當為華斯普第二或第三</p>
<p>號）發出若干魚雷，當時</p>
<p>日潛艇已向深處潛入，注</p>
<p>意聽取命中音響，但為時</p>
<p>不久，被敵水雷攻擊，故</p>
<p>敵艦如何沉沒，未能詳細</p>
<p>察知。又馬利亞納納水域</p>
<p>某潛艇隊，於六月三十日</p>
<p>下午八時左右，在塞班島</p>
<p>東方海面發現類似航空母</p>
<p>艦之敵艦，日軍當即施放</p>
<p>魚雷，命中該艦引起大火</p>
<p>，塞班島日軍對此着火敵</p>
<p>艦嚴軍監視，結果敵艦極</p>
<p>度傾斜後，遂為海濤吞沒</p>
<p>，此役日軍潛艇隊亦遭受</p>
<p>敵方熾烈攻擊，迄今尚未</p>
<p>歸還基地。近來電波探知</p>
<p>器日漸發達，活動極感困</p>
<p>難，但敵艦終難避免日潛</p>
<p>艇之攻擊。敵艦愈大，警</p>
<p>戒愈嚴，在日軍勇士旺盛</p>
<p>鬥志下，亦愈易擊沉。</p>
<h3>太平洋日軍　一週間戰况</h3>
<p>（續昨）</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社</p>
<p>電　南太平洋方面，所羅</p>
<p>門羣島　七月二十七日以</p>
<p>來，擁有迫擊砲之敵軍，</p>
<p>在特羅基納北方約二十公</p>
<p>里之加拉科巴附近，來攻</p>
<p>日軍陣地，但經日軍予以</p>
<p>反擊，已於八月二日將其</p>
<p>全部擊退。此外拉爾馬河</p>
<p>（特羅基納西方七公里半</p>
<p>）附近敵軍，亦曾於七月</p>
<p>下旬以來，連日來攻日軍</p>
<p>陣地，經日軍於八月七日</p>
<p>拂曉圍攻後，截至現在止</p>
<p>，經確認之戰果計敵遺屍</p>
<p>六十八具，重機槍被毀三</p>
<p>挺。拉巴爾方面敵美軍，</p>
<p>迭次利用該方面工人使，</p>
<p>武装，自身则安居後方警</p>
<p>战，极　其狡猾之能事。</p>
<p>新幾內亞島以西地區，敵</p>
<p>機之來製島頭半島日軍基</p>
<p>地，尤以八月十三日轟炸</p>
<p>馬諾克瓦利最為熾烈，來</p>
<p>襲架數竟有戰鬥轟炸機五</p>
<p>十八架之多。至蘇朗及法</p>
<p>克法克等地則未見敵機來</p>
<p>，現日軍各地部隊，正</p>
<p>從海陸空三方面猛施邀擊</p>
<p>中。北太平洋方面，八月</p>
<p>十二日畫間，敵機數架分</p>
<p>二次來襲，經日機迎擊後</p>
<p>，卒被擊落一架，至十五</p>
<p>日拂曉，又有敵機三架來</p>
<p>襲，但日方並未受任何損</p>
<p>失。（完）</p>
<h3>日駐蘇大使　返國述職</h3>
<p>越斯科二十日中央</p>
<p>社電　日駐蘇大使守島五</p>
<p>郎，為報吿各方情勢，於</p>
<p>十八日午後由莫斯科啓程</p>
<p>歸國述職。</p>
<h3>華北急起增產</h3>
<p>呼應前綫將士的血</p>
<p>戰，大東亞的兵站基地</p>
<p>華北，亦急起增產，與</p>
<p>日本內地後方生產陣的</p>
<p>總　起相一致。尤其從</p>
<p>塞班島全軍戰死的消息</p>
<p>發表以來，以華北軍組</p>
<p>成的增產挺身隊為首，</p>
<p>全體日本　民，學生，</p>
<p>在酷暑下動員奮鬥。華</p>
<p>北所貢獻於增強決戰戰</p>
<p>力的任務，跟着戰局的</p>
<p>深刻化而愈增其重要性</p>
<p>，因為增產，增送的如</p>
<p>何，可說已成完遂戰爭</p>
<p>之重要的基調。</p>
<p>原料供出</p>
<p>今後南方</p>
<p>戰力物資</p>
<p>的運輸，</p>
<p>勢必日趨</p>
<p>困難。面另一方面，華</p>
<p>北所担在的戰力必需物</p>
<p>資之供出，亦愈趨增大</p>
<p>。華北的鐵，煤，及鑒</p>
<p>，棉花，代替鋁精的礬</p>
<p>土頁岩等重要物資的對</p>
<p>日供给量，在整個大東</p>
<p>亞區域內占全體的〇〇</p>
<p>％。這數量對敵的物量</p>
<p>攻勢自嫌不够，而較現</p>
<p>在更多的增產增送，乃</p>
<p>必然的要求。近來的華</p>
<p>北，一面是原料供給地</p>
<p>，同時又發展到因就地</p>
<p>製品化而供給的任務。</p>
<p>故立在整備原料物資供</p>
<p>出，製品運轍二方面的</p>
<p>產業形態的新觀點，而</p>
<p>着手建設華北工業地帶</p>
<p>，大小的鎔鑛爐建設，</p>
<p>與輕金屬工場的設立等</p>
<p>着着進行，活潑的引擎</p>
<p>聲又在　動了。</p>
<p>運輸確保</p>
<p>而在增送</p>
<p>方面，因</p>
<p>船舶不足，</p>
<p>，海運困</p>
<p>難，故用陸運代替。以</p>
<p>華北交通會社為中心的</p>
<p>運輸力之　保，及接連</p>
<p>滿洲，朝鮮，蒙疆等地</p>
<p>運輸之確立，希望戰時</p>
<p>物資的運輸有長足的進</p>
<p>展。又這些重要物資的</p>
<p>增產增送上所必耍的食</p>
<p>糧間題，勞務問題等，</p>
<p>亦正在計劃改善增產對</p>
<p>策，集米對策，並因與</p>
<p>華中—滿洲，蒙疆，朝</p>
<p>鮮等地交易的圓滑化，</p>
<p>消除了華北的難題食米</p>
<p>問題的苦惱。</p>
<p>勞工需要</p>
<p>至於勞務</p>
<p>問題，因</p>
<p>勞工的需</p>
<p>要，共產</p>
<p>軍的攪亂勞工工作，而</p>
<p>疏散情事，使根本修正</p>
<p>了以前的勞務對策，而</p>
<p>強制推行勞務管理。但</p>
<p>由於物價的昻騰，治安</p>
<p>情况的變化等，在增產</p>
<p>增送方面，尚潛伏着訐</p>
<p>多隘路，大使館當局於</p>
<p>本年四月要求以山本大</p>
<p>東亞次官為團長的華北</p>
<p>產業視察團來訪問，根</p>
<p>據視察的結果，檢討打</p>
<p>開日木內地與華北間的</p>
<p>各種隘路，繼由於藤原</p>
<p>前無任所大臣的查察，</p>
<p>指出華北當前的問題，</p>
<p>不僅在於賽材的難得，</p>
<p>施設的不究全，條件的</p>
<p>不利等，而其急務實在</p>
<p>於產業形態之改組成戰</p>
<p>時形態。</p>
<p>克服困難</p>
<p>由　原前</p>
<p>無任所看</p>
<p>臣的話大</p>
<p>來，華北</p>
<p>的現狀，無論是生產的</p>
<p>隘路，運輸的隘路，都</p>
<p>須用更進一步的努力與</p>
<p>研究始可克服。常局乃</p>
<p>於上月十四日召集各公</p>
<p>館長會議，根據藤原查</p>
<p>察的結果，以謀華北產</p>
<p>業的大進展，樹立「增</p>
<p>產三級跳」的大方針，</p>
<p>基此決定增產，增送之</p>
<p>具體的推進方法，展開</p>
<p>華北軍的增產挺身隊及</p>
<p>各方面之全面的活動。</p>
<p>但另一方面駐渝美空軍</p>
<p>對華北的游擊戰，漸次</p>
<p>激化。對此，軍民雙方</p>
<p>都已樹立萬全對策，加</p>
<p>上華北民衆的協力決戰</p>
<p>，突破敵的空襲，向華</p>
<p>北目前所視為急務的增</p>
<p>產增送二大目標進行，</p>
<p>與內地生產力的急昇相</p>
<p>並行，華北的物量大攻</p>
<p>勢之轉移，不粉碎美國</p>
<p>的野心不止。（譯自八</p>

<p>州西部）西部地方，約達</p>
<p>一小時之久。　日制空部</p>
<p>隊當即邀擊，擊落其中十</p>
<p>數架，內中三架乃以飛機</p>
<p>相排擊落者，美駕駛員以</p>
<p>降落傘自擊落機上降下，</p>
<p>被捕若干名。　日方陸上</p>
<p>有若干損大。</p>
<p>東京二十日中央社</p>
<p>電　駐渝美空軍機動部隊</p>
<p>，自本年六月以來，三度</p>
<p>夜襲日本後，終於二十日</p>
<p>下午五時許侵入日本本土</p>
<p>，日制空部隊一體猛攻予</p>
<p>以重創。是日美空軍分數</p>
<p>編隊，企圖同時侵入北九</p>
<p>州西北部及中國地方西部</p>
<p>，整裝待發之日制空部隊</p>
<p>當一齊進攻，陸上砲火亦</p>
<p>予猛轟，立刻擊落其十數</p>
<p>架。未被擊落之敵機，亦</p>
<p>未能達其目的，盲目轟炸</p>
<p>後遁走。尤其中國西部敵</p>
<p>機因遭日制空部隊追擊，</p>
<p>未及投彈即行遁去，故毫</p>
<p>無損失。是役詳細戰果正</p>
<p>在調查，此後日大本營當</p>
<p>陸續發表。現在判明者至</p>
<p>少擊落敵機十餘架，約當</p>
<p>來襲敵機三分之一，其中</p>
<p>三架由日機衝撞而擊落者</p>
<p>。又北九州地區擊落之敵</p>
<p>機中，有數名美人駕駛員</p>
<p>以降落傘降下，立被日軍</p>
<p>俘虜，此外北九州地方陸</p>
<p>上數處受有若干損失，但</p>
<p>現下已判明者均極輕微。</p>
<p>南京短簡</p>
<h3>首都點滴</h3>
<p>— 閔賢</p>
<p>記者等來京，本為調查郊外農村經濟，適逢</p>
<p>城郊戒備森嚴，行走不便，祗得往城內放步，走</p>
<p>馬看花，所見無多，僅以瑣事數則向讀有報道：</p>
<p>南京城內，空地甚多，往昔固然有用以種菜</p>
<p>蒔花者，但並朱儘量利用，此次所見，囊時之牛</p>
<p>山　濯者，幾均已菜蔬滿地，田園都市，蔚為大</p>
<p>觀。基於生活高漲，無人不思適應環境，化無用</p>
<p>為有用。但年來當局積極提倡增產，首都城圈近</p>
<p>在咫尺，自應首先倡導也。</p>
<p>國府還都時，南京人口不過十餘萬，現據京</p>
<p>市府保甲委員會六月份調查報告，已達六九六四</p>
<p>〇三人，計「成人」男二九六五六九人，女二四</p>
<p>一三五六人，「兒童」男八二七五三人，女七五</p>
<p>七二五人，人口激增，即反映社會之繁榮。</p>
<p>京中自胡后在雨花台執行死刑以後，繼之以</p>
<p>顧周之被拘，其他司法幫辦　務段長法院推事檢</p>
<p>察長等陸續被押者，不在少數，以致首都地方看</p>
<p>守所，大有改為犯官寄宿舍之可能，一時風尚所</p>
<p>趨，似有漸見澄淸之勢。京中老百姓談話資料，</p>
<p>幾全為此事，國利民福，至堪期待。惟聞公務員</p>
<p>之再度加薪發米，尚未完全實現，而生活一再高</p>
<p>漲，奉公守法者，仍難免列於饑俄之羣。先儒倉</p>
<p>實而知禮義之說，似有待於賢明當局隨時調整</p>
<p>南京地方潦闊，而交通工具異常缺乏，頗感</p>
<p>不便。現在唯一由下關通達中華門貫穿城內之小</p>
<p>火車，復因班次減少，乘客更形擁擠，人力車索</p>
<p>價動輒數十百元，由下關通達新街口三山街之木</p>
<p>炭汽車，每次乘客至少十人，擠軋不堪，但因取</p>
<p>其快捷，且代價不貴，每次每人八十元，羣趨乘</p>
<p>之，傳說當周正計劃修一自夫子廟通達下關之電</p>
<p>適，果爾，則便利多矣。京市米價每石仍在四</p>
<p>千元左右，以致其他食品均較上海為廉。</p>
<h3>為整備國力　菲島新措施　疏散人口封閉夜娛樂塲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺二十日中央</p>
<p>社電　新生菲律賓如何整</p>
<p>備國力，應付決戰，實為</p>
<p>各國所關心。茲介紹馬尼</p>
<p>刺近况如次：馬尼刺自八</p>
<p>月一日起發已將舞塲·妓</p>
<p>院·舞蹈塲等夜間娛樂塲</p>
<p>所完全封閉，過去所映美</p>
<p>國電影，亦完全換映新本</p>
<p>出品及當地製品。菲律賓</p>
<p>之夜間娛樂場所，多集中</p>
<p>於馬尼刺，共達二十六處</p>
<p>之多，其中舞廳十五處·</p>
<p>妓院四處·舞蹈傳習所七</p>
<p>處，其封閉理由，不僅因</p>
<p>其為靑年墮落陷穽，且在</p>
<p>此貪糧困難物價飛漲之決</p>
<p>戰期中，對國計民生毫無</p>
<p>裨益。又此種夜間娛樂塲</p>
<p>所之性格，純係美國式，</p>
<p>故切望外僑及有志市民一</p>
<p>致協力。過去菲律賓允許</p>
<p>上演美國不健全之反戰及</p>
<p>色慾影片時，頗令人驚異</p>
<p>，現菲律賓保存美國影片</p>
<p>一千六百部，經再度檢查</p>
<p>結果，允許放映者，僅五</p>
<p>百部，今後日本電影普遍</p>
<p>放映時，則美國電影可逐</p>
<p>漸排除。又馬尼刺市內交</p>
<p>通限制時間，過去為上午</p>
<p>二時至六時，現已改為十</p>
<p>二時至翌晨六時，延展二</p>
<p>小時，深夜行人醉漢逐漸</p>
<p>減少。又馬尼刺之疏散人</p>
<p>口訂制，早於本年前決定</p>
<p>逐日疏散，因市民已認識</p>
<p>馬尼刺已入敵機飛行半徑</p>
<p>內，預防空中惡禍，更因</p>
<p>馬尼刺人口過剩，為解決</p>
<p>食糧交通住宅三問題，實</p>
<p>有疏散必要。菲律賓政府</p>
<p>決以澈底手段，取締馬尼</p>
<p>刺市民賭博跑馬等，茲將</p>
<p>無業市民完全疏散市外，</p>
<p>現已組成疏散委員會。馬</p>
<p>尼刺市內共有餐室八九百</p>
<p>冢，支持九萬市民食生活</p>
<p>，近因大衆食堂驟增，一</p>
<p>流飯莊亦可因而封閉。</p>
<h3>渝國共對立　日益深刻</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝方在</p>
<p>五月初旬，曾就渝共問題</p>
<p>，召開西安預備全議，正</p>
<p>式渝共調整交涉則在重慶</p>
<p>舉行。最近雙方談判已陷</p>
<p>決裂狀態中，延安方面，</p>
<p>要求設立特別政治區，外</p>
<p>援軍需品輸入延安，及延</p>
<p>安軍參加主要作戰等項，</p>
<p>延安主張之民主制度，相</p>
<p>去甚遠。渝方因受美國援</p>
<p>助，支持其抗戰政策，不</p>
<p>得不實施美國所要求之民</p>
<p>主政治。且國民黨所主張</p>
<p>之民主政治，乃在不抵觸</p>
<p>國民黨一黨專政之民主政</p>
<p>治，而延安方面所主張者</p>
<p>，故渝方雖向英美宣傳民</p>
<p>主政治，迄未能與延安妥</p>
<p>協。目下雙方之關整交涉</p>
<p>雖吿停頓，但未發生軍事</p>
<p>衝突，實因渝方畏懼美國</p>
<p>所致。今後國共交涉，是</p>
<p>否決裂，交涉決裂後，是</p>
<p>否立即訴諸武力，尙屬疑</p>
<p>問，惟國共對立關係，將</p>
<p>更趨深刻化，實屬確定不</p>
<p>移之勢。</p>
<h3>國府軍討伐　魯渝系軍隊</h3>
<p>濟南二十日中央社</p>
<p>電　國府第二方面軍，艾</p>
<p>蘭生團長，所率一隊，曾</p>
<p>於七月三十一日得日軍之</p>
<p>支援，在蒙陰縣北部，唐</p>

<p>七時許，在甘霖溝（澤縣</p>
<p>東南二十公里），攻擊渝</p>
<p>系山東保安隊第一團（團</p>
<p>長張里元）約二百人，是</p>
<p>役渝軍棄屍十五具，日軍</p>
<p>鹵獲武器彈藥等甚夥云。</p>

<p>實物，業經省府召集各</p>
<p>縣縣長財政局長賦稅管理</p>
<p>處主任會議，決定照預定</p>
<p>程序實施。茲悉省當局鑒</p>
<p>於本省各縣業戶，多有將</p>
<p>田畝放與佃戶耕種之習慣</p>
<p>，每年應收租息，則以米</p>
<p>價折合現鈔計算。今因徽</p>
<p>收實物之故，責令繳納米</p>
<p>稻，不無困難，為體恤此</p>
<p>種業戶起見，准由業戶指</p>
<p>定佃戶，由徽收機關直接</p>
<p>向佃戶微收。此項指佃完</p>
<p>糧辦法，已訂有租糧對照</p>
<p>表一種，限各業戶於九月</p>
<p>十日前，自行接照格式塡</p>
<p>就，申送當地徵收機關，</p>
<p>以憑辦理。</p>

<h3>科學技術與　生產行政一元化　日本內閣設立新機構</h3>
<p>日本新內閣以傾注全刀於軍需品之劃時期</p>
<p>的生產增強為施策的重要項目。最近有力的科</p>
<p>學技衛者之間，希望　基於作戰的要求，及目</p>
<p>前的資源環境，科學按衛與軍警生產行政應一</p>
<p>體化。　確立充分採納日本的科學技術之新軍</p>
<p>需品生產方式。這種希望的內容，可歸納為如</p>
<p>左諸點：</p>
<p>技術行政一體</p>
<p>一，生產行政與技</p>
<p>術行政的一元化　近代</p>
<p>戰是科學戰，今日的新</p>
<p>兵器，未必就是明日的</p>
<p>新兵器。故生產與科學</p>
<p>技術在行政上有一體化</p>
<p>的必要。然再看現狀，</p>
<p>軍需行政以飛機為中心</p>
<p>而在軍需省一元化起來</p>
<p>；最近更有人主張關於</p>
<p>兵本，艦本，燃料關係</p>
<p>的行政亦應一元化。而</p>
<p>技衛行政方面，繼技術</p>
<p>院的設置之後，內閣更</p>
<p>設置研究動員會議，對</p>
<p>於作戰所要求的研究課</p>
<p>題，研究者的決定，一</p>
<p>元的體制暫告完備。但</p>
<p>因是重要的軍需生產行</p>
<p>政與科學技術行政不直</p>
<p>接結連的關係，技術院</p>
<p>的意思，不充分反映於</p>
<p>生產官廳，又軍需省僅</p>
<p>主管飛機及有關兵器的</p>
<p>生產行政，技術關係依</p>
<p>然殘存於陸海軍，故飛</p>
<p>機生產欠圓滑。</p>
<p>因而科學技術者之</p>
<p>總力結集所致的武力之</p>
<p>強化及生產之增強，不</p>
<p>能期其美全。這裹，軍</p>
<p>需生產必須歸一於軍需</p>
<p>省，而技術行政也應歸</p>
<p>一於軍需省，或強力的</p>
<p>聯結起來。</p>
<p>生產力的增强</p>

<h3>Aftermath of the Special Tax Embezzlement Case</h3>
<p>The embezzlement case involving former staff of the Special Tax Office of the First District Public Office has aroused serious attention from all walks of life since its exposure. We briefly discussed it in a short commentary on the 15th. It is now heard that the municipal authorities and the responsible departments have decided to conduct a thorough investigation into the principal and accessory offenders in the case and punish them according to the law. The head of the Special Tax Section has been detained yesterday, and it is expected that the full details of the case will be announced to the public soon.</p>
<p>Financial needs require consolidation, and tax revenues require rectification. These are the most urgent needs in the municipal revitalization work because finance is the mother of all administrations. The advancement of various administrative tasks requires financial impetus. Regarding the aftermath of this embezzlement case, we offer a few more humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>First, this embezzlement case has been going on for a long time and is deeply rooted. It is said that the internal organization is also quite strict. Therefore, a wide range of aspects are involved, and the investigation must be conducted impartially. After the entire case is thoroughly investigated, in addition to punishing the principal and accessory offenders with the crimes they deserve, all the property of the principal offenders must be confiscated to warn other embezzlers.</p>
<p>Second, while conducting a fair investigation of the case, the responsible authorities should also actively compile a comprehensive reform plan for the collection of special taxes. The key to this plan is not to focus on trivial problems or partial reforms but to pay attention to overall planning, so that taxpayers cannot evade taxes and to reduce opportunities for fraud, making it impossible for the personnel involved to operate. The more transparent the tax collection method, the better, and the simpler the tax collection procedure, the better. Transparency allows taxpayers to fully understand, and collectors have no way to conceal. Simple procedures make it difficult for collectors to take advantage of fraud.</p>
<p>Third, the personnel of the tax collection agency should be given the utmost importance. The selection of the person in charge should not be based on the experience of handling tax collection, but should be based on reliable candidates recognized by the society, or the most reliable candidates recommended by well-established industrial and commercial groups. The treatment of general staff must be improved to reduce the motivation for illegal activities.</p>
<p>Fourth, the audit work has a transcendent and sacred nature. In addition to the person in charge of the competent authority, all relevant agencies, such as the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Advisory Committee, and secondly, the industrial and commercial sectors, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silver Money Association, should send personnel to participate in the joint audit.</p>
<p>Fifth, the industrial and commercial sectors should also exercise self-discipline. The embezzlement of some special tax office staff is mostly colluded with shops. Often, shop owners are unwilling to increase the wages of shop assistants in order to reduce their burden, so they take advantage of the ease of evasion of consumption special taxes, deliberately allowing shop assistants to collude with tax collectors to evade taxes and subsidize the living expenses of shop assistants. In the future, severe penalties should also be prescribed for tax evasion by the industrial and commercial sectors.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hoped that taxpayers will cooperate with the authorities to help prevent shop fraud. In the past, some small-scale shops did not issue invoices for the goods sold, but the taxes were collected as usual. If asked, they would say that the special tax had been included, which was obviously fraudulent tax evasion. The authorities should strictly order shops to issue invoices for the goods sold, stating the tax amount. Taxpayers should refuse or report shops that collect taxes without issuing invoices stating the tax amount.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops on Tinian and Guam Islands Fight Courageously, Launching Repeated Surprise Attacks That Leave the Enemy With No Chance to Breathe</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Central Pacific, 20th—The Japanese troops on Tinian and Guam Islands are inflicting heavy losses on the enemy with their natural defenses and are continuing to fight. On the night of the 18th, about fifty flares were seen over Tinian Island and about ten over Guam Island, crisscrossing each other, indicating the intensity of the battle.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th—It has been a month since the Japanese troops on Guam Island have been fighting bravely against the enemy with a small number of troops since the US troops landed on July 21. At present, the battle lines between the Japanese and US troops are still extremely intertwined, and chaotic battles are taking place everywhere. A correspondent for the Times magazine broadcast from the radio station on the 17th about the fierce resistance of the Japanese troops to the US troops who landed on the island, saying that it was even more intense than on Saipan Island. The main points are as follows: The difficulty of the battle on Guam Island was beyond expectation. In this landing operation, most of the US Pacific Fifth Fleet commanded by Halsey and the Third Amphibious Force participated. At the same time, the US Navy Third Division also landed from the middle of Asan Piatep Bay, north of Orote Port, to participate in the battle. The Japanese troops launched a fierce counterattack, especially the night raids, so the US troops killed in action and missing in action are about 150 or more every day, which is no less than the battle on Saipan Island. In order to relieve this difficult situation, the Army 77th Division had to be landed to support the battle, which is still continuing. The resistance of the Japanese troops has not weakened, and the US troops cannot afford to relax. The US Navy and small units of Japanese troops who are stubbornly resisting everywhere with strong positions have to engage in a battle without rest.</p>
<p>Japanese Submarine Results in the Mariana Sea</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Japanese Military Base in the Pacific, 20th—</p>
<p>Japanese submarines in the Mariana Islands area have overcome all difficulties in battle and have sunk many enemy ships by virtue of their stealth. On June 16, a new 45,000-ton enemy battleship that was firing on land 25,000 meters from Guam Island was sunk instantly by a Japanese submarine's surprise attack in broad daylight.</p>
<p>When enemy ships invaded the Mariana Islands, a Japanese submarine discovered a mobile unit composed of enemy battleship groups and aircraft carrier groups about 100 kilometers west of Rota Island. Due to the recent development of "radio wave detectors" and "underwater listening devices," it was difficult to approach enemy ships. However, the Japanese submarine disregarded everything and rushed towards a mother ship in the center of the enemy fleet, breaking through the enemy fleet's heaviest defenses. However, the Japanese submarine wanted to use close combat when it reached a considerable distance, and only grasped the target with a periscope, and fired several torpedoes at the enemy's "Wasp" type large aircraft carrier (Note: The Wasp was sunk by the Japanese submarine Gakuen on August 15, 1942, this should be the Wasp II or III). At that time, the Japanese submarine had dived deep and listened for the sound of the hit, but soon it was attacked by enemy mines, so it was not possible to know in detail how the enemy ship sank. Also, a submarine squadron in the Mariana waters discovered an enemy ship resembling an aircraft carrier on the eastern sea of Saipan Island at about 8:00 p.m. on June 30. The Japanese army immediately fired torpedoes, hitting the ship and causing a big fire. The Japanese army on Saipan Island strictly monitored the burning enemy ship. As a result, the enemy ship tilted sharply and was swallowed by the waves. In this battle, the Japanese submarine squadron also suffered fierce attacks from the enemy and has not yet returned to base. Recently, radio wave detectors have become increasingly developed, and activities have become extremely difficult, but enemy ships still cannot avoid the attacks of Japanese submarines. The larger the enemy ship and the stricter the alert, the easier it is to sink it with the vigorous fighting spirit of the Japanese soldiers.</p>
<h3>Pacific Japanese Army Situation in One Week</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th</p>
<p>In the South Pacific, since July 27, enemy troops with mortars have attacked the Japanese army positions near Galakoba, about 20 kilometers north of Torokina, Solomon Islands, but they were completely repelled by the Japanese army on August 2. In addition, enemy troops near the Larma River (7.5 kilometers west of Torokina) have also attacked the Japanese army positions for days since the end of July. After the Japanese army surrounded and attacked at dawn on August 7, as of now, the confirmed results include 68 enemy corpses and 3 destroyed heavy machine guns. In the Rabaul area, the enemy US army repeatedly used the workers in the area to arm themselves, while they stayed behind to guard the rear, doing everything they could to be cunning.</p>
<p>In the area west of New Guinea Island, enemy aircraft attacked the Japanese army base on the Bird's Head Peninsula. The bombing of Manokwari on August 13 was the most intense, with as many as 58 fighter-bombers attacking. No enemy aircraft were seen in Sorong and Fakfak, etc. At present, Japanese troops in various places are fiercely intercepting from the sea, land, and air. In the North Pacific, several enemy aircraft attacked twice during the day on August 12. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, one aircraft was shot down. At dawn on the 15th, three more enemy aircraft attacked, but the Japanese side did not suffer any losses. (End)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Returns Home to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Moscow, 20th—Goro Shigemitsu, Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, left Moscow on the afternoon of the 18th to return home to report on the situation in various aspects.</p>
<h3>North China Rapidly Increases Production</h3>
<p>Responding to the bloody battles of the soldiers at the front, North China, the logistics base of the Greater East Asia, is also rapidly increasing production, in line with the overall mobilization of the rear production base in Japan. Especially since the announcement of the news of the complete annihilation of the army on Saipan Island, the entire Japanese population, including students, led by the North China Army's production volunteer team, have been mobilized and struggling in the sweltering heat. The task of North China's contribution to strengthening the decisive battle power is becoming increasingly important as the war situation deepens, because how much production and transportation there is can be said to have become an important basis for completing the war.</p>
<p>Raw Material Supply</p>
<p>Southern</p>
<p>War Material</p>
<p>Transportation</p>
<p>Will inevitably become</p>
<p>More difficult. On the other hand, the supply of war necessary materials undertaken by North China is also increasing. The amount of iron, coal, and antimony, cotton, and alunite shale, etc., which are important materials that replace aluminum, supplied by North China to Japan accounts for 0% of the entire Greater East Asia region. This amount is not enough to counter the enemy's material offensive, and more production and transportation than the current amount is an inevitable requirement. In recent years, North China has not only been a raw material supply base but has also developed into a task of supplying products made on the spot. Therefore, from the new perspective of industrial form that prepares for the supply of raw materials and the transportation of products, the construction of the North China industrial zone has begun. The construction of large and small smelting furnaces and the establishment of light metal factories are proceeding step by step, and the lively engine sounds are moving again.</p>
<p>Transportation Guarantee</p>
<p>As for transportation</p>
<p>Due to</p>
<p>Insufficient ships</p>
<p>Sea transport is difficult</p>
<p>Therefore, land transport is used instead. The guarantee of transportation capacity centered on the North China Transportation Company and the establishment of transportation connecting Manchuria, Korea, Mengjiang, etc. are expected to greatly improve the transportation of wartime materials. In addition, the food problem and labor problem, etc., which are necessary for the increase in production and transportation of these important materials, are also being planned to improve the production increase measures, rice collection measures, and because of the smooth transaction with Central China, Manchuria, Mengjiang, Korea, etc., the difficult food rice problem in North China has been eliminated.</p>
<p>Labor Needs</p>
<p>As for labor</p>
<p>Problems, because</p>
<p>Of the need</p>
<p>For labor, the Communist</p>
<p>Army's disruption of labor work, and</p>
<p>The evacuation situation has fundamentally revised</p>
<p>The previous labor measures and</p>
<p>Forcibly promote labor management. However</p>
<p>Due to rising prices, changes in the security situation, etc.,</p>
<p>There are still many hidden difficulties in increasing production</p>
<p>and transportation. The embassy authorities in</p>
<p>April of this year requested that Yamamoto</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Greater East Asia lead the North China</p>
<p>Industry Inspection Group to visit. According</p>
<p>To the results of the inspection, examine and open</p>
<p>Various difficulties between the Japanese mainland and North China,</p>
<p>Following the investigation by Fujiwara</p>
<p>Former Minister without Portfolio,</p>
<p>It was pointed out that the current problems in North China</p>
<p>Are not only the difficulty in obtaining materials,</p>
<p>The incomplete facilities, the unfavorable conditions, etc.,</p>
<p>And the urgent task is actually</p>
<p>To reorganize the industrial form into wartime</p>
<p>Form.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties</p>
<p>From Fujiwara</p>
<p>Former Minister without Portfolio's</p>
<p>Words,</p>
<p>The current situation in North China,</p>
<p>Whether it is the bottleneck in production or the bottleneck in transportation,</p>
<p>Must be overcome with further efforts and</p>
<p>Research. The Standing Bureau then</p>
<p>Convened a meeting of the heads of the various public halls on the 14th of last month,</p>
<p>Based on Fujiwara's</p>
<p>Inspection results, in order to promote the great development of North China's industry,</p>
<p>Establish a grand policy of "tripling production,"</p>
<p>Based on this, decide to increase production, the</p>
<p>Specific methods of promoting transportation,</p>
<p>Unfold</p>
<p>The North China Army's production volunteer team and</p>
<p>Comprehensive activities in various aspects.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is gradually</p>
<p>Intensifying the guerrilla warfare in North China.</p>
<p>In response, both the military and the people</p>
<p>Have established foolproof measures, plus</p>
<p>The cooperation and decisive battle of the North China people,</p>
<p>Breaking through the enemy's air raids, aiming at the two major goals of</p>
<p>Increased production and transportation, which North China currently regards as urgent,</p>
<p>And together with the rapid rise of the mainland's production capacity,</p>
<p>The shift of North China's material offensive, not crushing the United States' ambition, will not stop. (Translated from the Yomiuri Shimbun of August 2)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attacking Kyushu and Other Places, More Than Ten Aircraft Shot Down, Proving the Strictness of the Japanese Air Defense Array</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th—The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 8:00 p.m. on August 20: At 5:00 p.m. today, about 60 U.S. Air Force aircraft stationed in Chongqing, organized into several echelons, attacked Kyushu and western China (western part of the Japanese mainland) for about an hour. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them, shooting down more than ten of them. Among them, three were shot down by aircraft colliding with each other. Several American pilots parachuted from the downed aircraft and were captured. There was some damage on the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th—The mobile unit of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has invaded the Japanese mainland at about 5:00 p.m. on the 20th after attacking Japan three times at night since June of this year. The Japanese air force launched a fierce attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. On that day, the U.S. Air Force formed several formations, attempting to invade simultaneously the northwestern part of northern Kyushu and the western part of the Chugoku region. The Japanese air force, which was ready to go, launched a joint attack, and land artillery also bombarded fiercely, immediately shooting down more than ten of them. The enemy aircraft that were not shot down also failed to achieve their goals, blindly bombed, and fled. In particular, the enemy aircraft in western China were chased by the Japanese air force and fled without dropping bombs, so there were no losses. The detailed battle results are still being investigated, and the Japanese General Headquarters will continue to announce them. It is now clear that at least more than ten enemy aircraft were shot down, about one-third of the attacking enemy aircraft. Among them, three were shot down by Japanese aircraft colliding with them. In addition, several American pilots shot down in the northern Kyushu area parachuted and were immediately captured by the Japanese army. In addition, several places on land in the northern Kyushu area suffered some damage, but it has now been determined that they are all very minor.</p>

<h3>Glimpses of the Capital</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Reporters and others came to Nanjing to investigate the rural economy in the suburbs. It happened that the city suburbs were heavily guarded, making it inconvenient to travel around. We had to walk around the city and take a cursory look. We didn't see much, so we only report a few trivial matters to the readers:</p>
<p>There are many open spaces in Nanjing City. In the past, there were people who used them to grow vegetables and plant flowers, but they didn't try their best to use them. What we saw this time was that almost all of the former useless mountain depressions were filled with vegetables. The garden city is a great sight. Based on the rising cost of living, everyone is thinking about adapting to the environment and turning the useless into the useful. In recent years, the authorities have actively promoted increased production, and the capital city circle is close at hand, so it should be the first to promote it.</p>
<p>When the National Government returned to Nanjing, the population of Nanjing was only more than 100,000. Now, according to the June survey report of the Nanjing Municipal Government Baojia Committee, it has reached 696,403 people, including 296,569 "adult" men, 241,356 women, 82,753 "children" men, and 75,725 women. The rapid increase in population reflects the prosperity of society.</p>
<p>Since Hu Hou was executed in Yuhuatai in Beijing, followed by Gu Zhou's detention, and other judicial assistants, section chiefs, court judges, prosecutors, etc., have been arrested one after another, so that the capital detention center may be changed into a dormitory for criminal officials. For a time, the trend seemed to be gradually becoming clearer. Almost all of the conversation materials of the old people in Beijing are about this matter, and the national interest and people's welfare are worthy of expectation. However, it is heard that the second salary increase and rice distribution for civil servants have not been fully realized, and the cost of living has continued to rise, so those who abide by the law are still inevitably among the hungry. The ancient Confucian saying that the granary is full and then knows etiquette and justice seems to be adjusted by the wise authorities at any time.</p>
<p>Nanjing is vast, and transportation is extremely lacking, which is very inconvenient. Now, the only small train that runs from Xiaguan to Zhonghua Gate and runs through the city is even more crowded due to the reduction in the number of trains. The price of rickshaws is often dozens or hundreds of yuan. The charcoal cars that run from Xiaguan to Xinjiangkou Sanshan Street carry at least ten passengers each time, which is extremely crowded, but because of their speed and low cost, each person is charged 80 yuan each time, and people flock to ride them. It is said that Zhou Zheng plans to build an electric train from Fuzimiao to Xiaguan. If so, it will be much more convenient. The price of rice in Beijing is still around 4,000 yuan per stone, so that other foods are cheaper than in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>New Measures in the Philippines to Strengthen National Power, Evacuate Population, and Close Night Entertainment Venues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Manila, 20th—How the new Philippines is strengthening its national power and coping with the decisive battle is of concern to all countries. The following is an introduction to the recent situation in Manila: Manila has completely closed dance halls, brothels, dance halls, and other night entertainment venues since August 1. American movies that were shown in the past have also been completely replaced by new Japanese products and local products. Night entertainment venues in the Philippines are mostly concentrated in Manila, with a total of 26, including 15 dance halls, 4 brothels, and 7 dance training centers. The reason for their closure is not only because they are traps for the moral degradation of young people, but also because they are of no benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood in this decisive battle period when food is scarce and prices are soaring. Moreover, the character of this kind of night entertainment venue is purely American, so it is hoped that foreigners and aspiring citizens will cooperate. In the past, the Philippines allowed the performance of unhealthy anti-war and erotic films from the United States, which was quite surprising. The Philippines currently has 1,600 American films. After re-examination, only 500 are allowed to be shown. In the future, when Japanese films are widely shown, American films can be gradually eliminated. In addition, the traffic restriction time in Manila has been changed from 2:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. in the past to 12:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning, extending it by two hours. The number of pedestrians and drunkards late at night has gradually decreased. In addition, the plan to evacuate the population of Manila was decided earlier this year and will be evacuated every day. Because the citizens have realized that Manila has entered the radius of enemy aircraft, to prevent air disasters, and because the population of Manila is too large, to solve the three problems of food, transportation, and housing, it is necessary to evacuate. The Philippine government has decided to thoroughly take measures to ban gambling and horse racing among Manila citizens, and will completely evacuate unemployed citizens outside the city. An evacuation committee has now been formed. There are 800 to 900 restaurants in Manila, supporting the food and life of 90,000 citizens. Recently, due to the sudden increase in public canteens, first-class restaurants can also be closed.</p>
<h3>The Confrontation Between the Chongqing Nationalists and Communists is Becoming Increasingly Profound</h3>
<p>Central News Agency News—In early May, Chongqing held a Xi'an preparatory conference on the Chongqing Communist issue, and formal Chongqing Communist adjustment negotiations were held in Chongqing. Recently, the negotiations between the two sides have been in a state of breakdown. Yan'an has requested the establishment of a special political zone, the import of foreign aid military supplies into Yan'an, and the participation of the Yan'an army in major operations. The democratic system advocated by Yan'an is far from it. Because Chongqing is receiving American aid, it supports its anti-war policy and has to implement the democratic politics required by the United States. Moreover, the democratic politics advocated by the Kuomintang is democratic politics that does not conflict with the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, while what Yan'an advocates is therefore, although Chongqing has promoted democratic politics to Britain and the United States, it has not been able to compromise with Yan'an. Although the adjustment negotiations between the two sides have stopped, no military conflict has occurred, in fact because Chongqing fears the United States. Whether the Nationalists and Communists will break down in the future, and whether they will immediately resort to force after the breakdown of negotiations, is still a question, but the confrontational relationship between the Nationalists and Communists will become more profound, which is a definite and unshakable trend.</p>
<h3>Nationalist Government Army Punishes Lu-Yu Faction Troops</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Jinan, 20th—The Nationalist Government's Second Army, led by Regiment Commander Ai Lansheng, with the support of the Japanese army, punished about 2,000 Yu faction troops in the northern part of Mengyin County, near Tangzhuang, on July 31. At dawn on the 31st, they encountered Yu troops near Xucun. The Yu troops counterattacked seven times, but were finally defeated by our side. In this battle, 265 corpses of Yu troops were recovered. In addition, the Japanese army punishment team attacked the First Regiment of the Yu faction Shandong Security Force (Regiment Commander Zhang Liyuan) of about 200 people in Ganlinggou (20 kilometers southeast of Ze County) at about 7:00 a.m. on July 9. In this battle, the Yu troops abandoned 15 corpses, and the Japanese army seized a large number of weapons and ammunition, etc.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Formulates Methods for Designated Tenants to Pay Grain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 20th—Since this year, Jiangsu Province has changed the land tax to in-kind. The provincial government has convened a meeting of county magistrates, finance bureau chiefs, and tax administration office directors to decide to implement it according to the scheduled procedures. It is learned that the provincial authorities, in view of the habit of landowners in various counties of the province to rent out their fields to tenants for cultivation, calculate the annual rent income by converting the rice price into cash. Now, because of the collection of in-kind, it is inevitable that there will be difficulties in ordering them to pay rice. In order to take care of these landowners, they are allowed to designate tenants, and the collection agency directly collects from the tenants. This method of designated tenants to pay grain has a rent and grain comparison table, which requires landowners to fill in the form according to the format and submit it to the local collection agency before September 10 for processing.</p>

<h3>Integration of Science and Technology with Production Administration; New Organization Established in the Japanese Cabinet</h3>
<p>The new Japanese cabinet considers a massive increase in war production as the most important priority. Recently, there are strong expectations among powerful scientists and technicians that, based on the requirements of the war and the current resource environment, science and technology should be integrated with military production administration. Establishing a new war production method that fully utilizes Japan's scientific and technological capabilities. The content of these expectations can be summarized as the following points:</p>
<p>Integration of Technical Administration</p>
<p>1.  Integration of Production Administration and Technical Administration: Modern warfare is a science war. Today's new weapons may not be tomorrow's new weapons. Therefore, production and science and technology must be integrated administratively. However, looking at the current situation, war production administration, centered on aircraft, has been centralized in the Ministry of Munitions. Recently, some have argued that the administration of army ordinance, naval ordinance, and fuel should also be integrated. In terms of technical administration, following the establishment of the Technology Institute, the cabinet also established the Research Mobilization Council. A unified system for research tasks and researcher decisions requested by the war has been provisionally completed. However, because important war production administration and scientific and technological administration are not directly linked, the intentions of the Technology Institute are not fully reflected in the production ministries. Furthermore, the Ministry of Munitions only manages the production administration of aircraft and related weapons. Technical relations still remain within the army and navy, which impedes smooth aircraft production.</p>
<p>Therefore, the strengthening of military power and the increase in production resulting from the collective efforts of scientists and technicians cannot be fully realized. Here, war production must be unified under the Ministry of Munitions, and technical administration should also be unified under the Ministry of Munitions, or strongly linked together.</p>
<p>Increasing Productivity</p>
<p>2.  Maintaining and Enhancing Existing Productivity: In order to maintain and enhance existing productivity, labor management must be refreshed, the level of production technology must be improved, and its application methods must be thoroughly characterized and made scientific for wartime. Furthermore, material and human resources in various aspects must be used efficiently through a unified national comprehensive plan.</p>
<p>For example, eliminating all-encompassing war production methods, adapting to the requirements of the war, and focusing all efforts on the production of aircraft and landing craft, while temporarily suspending the production of battleships, etc.</p>
<p>Establishing a Production System</p>
<p>3.  Establishment of a New War Production System: Looking at the state of production warfare in the Greater East Asia War, it is merely a confrontation between the mass production methods of the United States and Britain and similar Japanese production methods. Therefore, we cannot yield an inch to the enemy's rapid counterattack with its emphasis on quantity.</p>
<p>To break this situation, we must abandon the production methods of the United States and Britain and produce new war materials based on the characteristics of Japan, so that Japanese soldiers can fully utilize them. Needless to say, the production of new war materials has been steadily achieving results, but we cannot be satisfied at the present stage.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to achieve the goal of producing new war materials, we must go beyond the scope of the army, navy, or the Ministry of Munitions and immediately summon and mobilize necessary scientists and technicians, organize them into units, and enforce special research tasks that proceed alongside warfare day and night, so that their results can be materialized and applied to the war effort.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to ensure appropriate and rapid adjustment, research, production, and application, we must combine the currently dispersed planning hubs—establish an agency with the nature of a wartime administrative staff headquarters in the cabinet, and address the accumulated issues from a national perspective. This is an indispensable condition.</p>

<h3>Equality and Justice</h3>
<p>— Jia Ling</p>
<p>The Jiaotong University Tuition Fee Problem</p>
<p>I received a letter from the school, which contained a school opening schedule and a tuition fee bill. The tuition fee bill was printed with words like "Ministry of Education Directive", it turns out the tuition fee for the next semester has been approved by the Ministry of Education, and the directive number is specifically recorded as proof, fearing that students would not be clear about it. The result: Tuition fee 5,000 yuan, medical fee 100 yuan, miscellaneous fees are not included, and those who have chemical experiments have to pay extra experimental fees. The school, is the prestigious National Jiaotong University.</p>
<p>Not long ago, there were articles in the newspaper discussing the gains and losses of Jiaotong University's tuition fee rising to 1,000 yuan next semester. It was all very logical. But now it has become 5,000 yuan! If it is for the livelihood of the teachers and 5,000 yuan is a necessity, then the students, as long as they have the ability, will pay even if they have to pawn everything. We can't starve the teachers! Look! Aren't the private universities charging 6,000 or 7,000 yuan? Hujiang University charges 6,000. St. John's 7,000. But of course, we have to understand the "National" title. On August 12th, there was another piece of news in the newspaper: "...The tuition fee for National Central University is set at 800 yuan..." Another "National" university. But what about the tuition fee? 800 yuan.</p>
<p>One is 5,000 yuan, the other is 800 yuan. Is there a reason? Of course, there is a reason.</p>
<p>Rice in Nanjing costs 3,000 yuan per stone, and in Shanghai it costs 7,000 yuan per stone. But even with cheaper rent, etc., the maximum ratio is only one to three. And isn't cloth cheaper in Shanghai than in Nanjing? And... so at most three times 800, is 2,400. Are there other reasons? Yes! The Ministry of Education's subsidies are different! Why? The difference in the amount is so large? This needs an explanation. Well, everyone is "National", one is "Jiaotong", the other is "Central". Oh, because it is "Central"! But is this a reason? I am a little confused. We need an explanation.</p>
<p>In primary school, we learned about "equality", and in middle school, we learned about "justice", but now in university, we are getting more and more confused. Of course, we believe that our wise government must be very clear. It can explain to us, explain it very pleasantly. We are looking forward to seeing the explanation!</p>
<h3>Weekly Industrial and Commercial Market Conditions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai market's surplus funds and industrial and commercial market conditions have become more stable in the past week. After the rampant black market calmed down, there was another price surge at the end of the week. Sycee silver also saw a slight rise in trading. Because the Central Bank is doing its best to regulate the head position, the money supply is still relaxed. The overnight loan interest rate of the money industry is listed at 3.7%, and has not changed. However, general speculative funds are converging on investing in enterprises, so the Hua share market has been rising steadily and the market trading is extremely prosperous. Among the various industrial and commercial sectors, domestic products have generally seen a slight decline, but the price increase of items related to industrial production is more obvious. This is because the production volume of the industry is reduced by a limit on power usage. As a result, items like cigarettes, matches, soap and candles have all risen from before. Among them, the price surge of cigarettes is the most severe. As for the flour related to people's livelihood, most flour mills are still operating as usual, and the authorities are supplying as much electricity as possible to the flour mills. Therefore, the amount of flour production has increased sharply, and the allocation of flour to household accounts has doubled compared to the past, so the price of flour is stable. Rice is also being supplied on a regular basis in the household rice program, and rice shipped from inland to Shanghai is continuously arriving. In addition, the new rice is about to be available, and there is no worry about the source being exhausted, and the people's food can be stable for a long time. For this reason, the price of rice continued to fall in the past week.</p>

<h3>Today's Match Schedule for the Fuhua Cup Small Ball Tournament</h3>
<p>In the Fuhua Cup Small Ball League, in several matches last week, the Fu Group's Xuanjiong won against the Police Protection Team, while Huatong lost 3-0 to the Jews. In the Hua Group, Huanan's ball luck was extremely poor and shook hands with Sorkel for a draw. In another match, the result between Hequn and Jishe was related to the championship, so both sides concentrated their efforts. Hequn also had Tie Mengai from Tiemen come to help, making the game extremely tense. Hequn finally relied on the soldiers to exert their efforts and won over Jishe with a score of 3-2. There will still be two matches at the original location starting at 5:00 this afternoon, both in the Hua Group. In the first match, the German Merchants and the Portuguese Merchants will meet. Although the former's record has not been particularly good, its lineup is not weak. The latter is making its first appearance, so it is difficult to predict the outcome. In the second match, Jishe will meet Sorkel. Jishe has ample strength, and it should be able to win.</p>
