<h3 id="c1">上海興亡上海人有責 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨天本報星期評論，船津先生提出我國明末大儒顧亭林的兩句話：「天下興亡，匹夫有責」。末了，並說：「上海興亡，上海人有責」。我們緬懷先賢昭示我們的箴言，同時，我們居於上海人的地位，很有一番感觸。船津先生是一個旅華五十六年的「中國之友」，他熟悉中國的一切，他所指的上海人，當然包括居住於上海的全體巿民，他就日本人對於國家的責任感，與中國人衡量，認為日本人比較普遍而熱烈，這是憑他平日接觸的經騐考察，自非主觀的武斷。可是，我們的先賢顧亭林所說的「天下興亡，匹夫有責」，又是多麼富於人民對於國家責任感的意義。今天社會上還有很多人「放棄責任，袖手旁觀」，對之尤其覺得慚愧。</p>
<p>然而，時代環境，畢竟是推陳出新，前進不已，國家社會的工作，隨時需要人民適應時代環境去應付，消極地放棄責任的「出世」態度，無論如何，祗有增加環境惡化的嚴重性。我們須睜開眼睛，重視現實，以共同的努力，打開環境，改善環境。</p>
<p>上海地位的重要，我們已屢次言之；上海危機的四伏，我們亦已屢次指出。堪以欣慰的，市政當局對此問題已在密切重視。加强政治力量，前途已露曙光，如最近市府调整人事，使之健全，準備設置市政諮詢委員會。如果從此建立官民協力的途徑，而共同邁進，那末，最短時期，强化政治力量，可以預卜。據我們所知，陳市長對於上海市政，有遠大的抱負，而不參成見，於整個上海有利的意見，都可接受考慮。這是眞誠愛護上海者貢獻力量的最好機會，尤其不應畏首畏尾，放棄責任。</p>
<p>我們認為目前上海，加强政治力量以外,最急切的問題，是治安與經濟兩事。以言治安，則警察任務的加强，自屬必要。所以，為加强治安力量，而提高警察服務效能，而改善警察生活，而組織警察消費合作社，也屬必要。由於治安觀點以視合作社組織，當然是市民自己的責任，不能推諉的。進一步說，治安的維護，對於金融界工商界及殷富尤有密切關係，試問富有人士雇用一名保鑣，是否予以飽食而後期其服務忠勤，那末，為保護公眾利益的警察，焉有不使飽食而能忠勤服務之理。所以，警察消費合作社進行順利的程度如何，可作社會領袖關心公益的程度如何的試騐。</p>
<p>至於經濟問題，本報亦巳屢言之，不在加强統制，而應加强管制，同時，應加强經濟警察的力量，幷從速使本巿經濟行政機關一元化，以澄淸經濟上的不合理現象。我們常聞少數機關的公務員以壓迫要挾手段，向關係市民或商人浮收或額外需索，政府當局應詳密規定舞弊罰則，從嚴處罰，必要時組織單位，專門接受市民吿發，歡迎市民吿發，或委由市民福利協會辦理。巿民遇有此種情事，萬勿暗中隱忍，儘可向關係當局吿發如甘行賄賂，隱不吿發，一旦發現，應受賄舞弊者受同等處罰。</p>
<p>政府當局振作，市民亦須振作，唯有共同振作，才能克服上海的危機，完成建設新上海的任務，凡是居住上海的人們，都有份子的責任。</p>

<h3 id="c3">哥希馬附近殘敵　日軍繼續掃蕩中　蒙特巴頓承認戰局趨嚴重 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　印度前綫某地九日電：日軍於六日晨完全攻略哥希馬後，即繼續急追潰敗之敵，目下在哥希馬附近展開壮烈之殲滅戰。日軍之一部由哥希馬東方進抵哥希馬北方後，於六日下午佔領西方之高地，遮斷敵軍退路。另一部則由哥希馬南方北上，在哥希馬附近　淸殘敵，續向哥希馬北方急追。又一部抵哥希馬至迪瑪普爾公路西側以後，即於七日完全確保該公路之要衝，而遮斷該方面之敵軍退路。敵軍因日軍之奇襲與猛攻，已呈四分五裂之混亂狀態，刻正企圖向西北方逃脫中。又日軍對敵之包圍綱業已完成，故敵軍實無從突圍，今敵軍千人若不投降，則祗有被殲矣。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　據新德里電：蒙特巴頓八日說明戰况稱，反軸心軍在俯瞰伊姆法爾平原之丘陵地帶作戰，自屬一重要地區，將日印軍擊退後，已使該地區之反軸心軍陣地改善，至對全般局勢趨於惡化，及日印軍佔領哥希馬等事實，則極力加以掩飾。但新德里消息靈通方面則指出日軍已進抵印度領內六十四公里之地點，並謂哥希馬距離安加拉阿薩密鐵路僅四十公里，對目前情勢頗感憂慮。</p>
<p>加薩區英軍五千人被圍</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電印緬前綫日軍某基地訊：日軍谷部隊已在茵達烏（Indaw加薩西南六十公里）摩魯（Moelu加薩西北五十公里）地區，將敵大部隊約五千人包圍，自六日始對之開始攻擊。另一隊日軍進攻茵達烏，將該地區北部之敵軍擊退，更向應魯方面急追敗敵，在摩魯東方一公里之地點壓縮包圍綱，復作猛攻。又一日軍部隊亦自某方面開始行動嗎，追擊在該地區蠢動之敵軍。現已進摩魯達摩魯東方三公里之地點。摩尼伊姆（Mohyin）地區之日軍有力部隊亦與此相呼應，自北方追擊敵軍。日航空部隊則與陸上部隊緊密協力，猛炸加拉特（Kolat）敵機塲，更連日轟炸敵空軍挺身隊之空輸基地希爾基亞及伊姆法爾兩機塲，於中途邀繫救護該兩機塲之敵戰鬥機，將之擊退，刻該方面正展開一大空路殲滅戰。</p>
<p>敵基本戰略完全被粉碎</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日印軍於東印地區巳自三方面將敵之牙城伊姆法爾包圍，伊姆法爾之陷落僅為時間問題。日印軍於六日晨突入哥希馬市內面將該地完全佔領。按哥希馬乃阿薩密孟加拉鐵路之要衝，位於距迪瑪普爾僅五十公里之地點，由於哥希馬之陷落，阿薩密孟加拉鐵路即感受重大威脅。</p>
<p>按日印軍於二月八日開始進攻　丘陵地帶，即將印度國境要塞綫英印第四軍各部隊包圍殲滅，更進至姆法爾平原，將敵之注意力完全移至伊姆法爾正面。其間於十五日渡過更的宛河之日，日印軍於拔海八千公尺及滿佈密林之山　地帶修築道路，俾繼續進攻，粉碎敵軍戰意，　後更進至哥希馬附近而將該地佔領。至是刻在富貢區活動中之史蒂威爾軍及加薩摩尼伊姆之敵空輸部隊等之補給路，亦全被遮斷而陷於孤立，敵方打通萊多公路之夢想終成畫餅，同時丁蘇基挨，萊多等鐵路綫要衝及對渝空輸基地均無從發揮機能，敵之基本戰略在圖增强中國大陸方面之戰力，太平洋及中國大陸兩方面夾擊日軍，決無實現可能。</p>
<h3 id="c4">印民軍進兵祖國　泰首相電賀 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>盤谷九日中央社電　泰首相畢本為印度國民軍進軍祖國，及其今後之成功，特於七日致電印　民軍最高指揮鮑斯氏祝賀。電文內容如次：「親愛之印度國民諸君，今鮑斯氏指揮下之印度國民軍已為解放祖國而邁入印度，此實為全亞洲人民至深同慶者·當此決戰之秋，余代表泰國國民對印度國民軍表示感佩，並祈印度國民軍諸君繼續向祖國挺進，以獲得為道義而戰之最後勝利。」</p>
<h3 id="c5">印解放戰爭　必能達目的　義主席發表論文 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電據羅馬電：義各報四日均刋載墨索里尼主席以「印度乃印度人之印度」為題所撰之論文，內容力言日印軍於東印度作戰之意義，謂該作戰予此次之戰爭以重大影響，實為世界史上空前之一大事件。爰印度解放之大任，非印度內部之國民遝動或印度國民軍所能單獨擔任者，必須與日軍協力始克達成。印度國境之反軸心軍被擊滅時，東條首相所謂「印度乃印度人之印度」之主張，定可使印度國民運動愈形熾烈，使印度早日脫離英國之壓迫·印度獨立運動自一八五七年之叛亂以來，雖有幾多犧牲，而亦有相當進展，該運動各派之綱領雖非完全一致，然驅逐英國勢力之目的則係一致。甘地不合作運動雖未能解決印度獨立問題，然是項問題之意義則已向世界闡明矣·今印度已在日軍協力下開始進攻虐待印人之外國軍隊，義人與軸心軍係立於同一戰綫者，故極關心印度獨立運動之進展。</p>

<p>馬尼刺中九央日社電　菲律賓共和國財部國庫局，八日上午發表首屆國會中曾議決特別預算案，該預算案中之一億菲幣缺額，菲決由發行公債補足之，即自本月八日開始發售第一次公債計二千萬菲幣。</p>

<p>日軍某基地九日中央社電　日陸軍機八日拂嘵冒惡劣天氣，連續空襲桂林西南之敵機塲，排除敵熾烈之高射砲火及戰鬥機之截擊，炸毀敵機塲一行路，使其二處起火，尙有其他戰果，以視野漠糊，未能確認，是役日機自炸一架，尙有一架未還基地。</p>

<p>里斯本九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據倫敦消息：英國政界意見，以為美國務副卿史蒂丁尼斯之訪英，乃羅邱斯再度會晤之前奏。但倫敦及華盛頓方面，則欲解決英美間之懸案後，再與斯達林會晤，以免再蹈去年德黑　會議時分別對蘇談判之覆轍。倫敦政界認為美國務副卿此次訪英，其理由即在於此。羅斯福及邱吉爾業已邀請斯達林赴會，但尙未接斯氏之答覆。</p>

<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　據德軍前綫消息：德軍刻在奧迪薩東方及東北方地區，繼續縮短戰綫，蘇軍跟蹤欲包圍奧迪薩，故該方面戰局日見嚴重。蘇軍自奧迪薩西北方南下，正與德軍激戰，奧迪薩北方郊外之德駐軍，亦與蘇軍先鋒部隊激戰。又普魯斯河中游方面之蘇軍，刻已進抵塞勒河（Seret）岸，遭德羅聯軍猛攻，似已陷於苦戰狀態。</p>
<p>柏林九日中央社電，海通社訊：德軍在東綫北路那爾瓦河方面展開攻勢，蘇軍屢在奧迪薩方面進攻德軍障碍陣地，及德軍在塞爾諾蒂泰諾波爾，勃羅第及柯維爾等地之不斷進展，乃東綫之最近戰况。德軍進攻那爾瓦區，以該城西南那爾瓦河左岸之蘇軍橋頭堡殘餘為主要目標，而蘇軍則復作突入普萊斯哥夫湖迤南之企圖。普萊斯哥迤南之激戰，進行以來已歷多日，其地即在奧斯特洛夫東南，蘇軍之戰略乃欲向波羅的海各國方面，强行突入德軍陣地，蘇軍惜人力前仆後繼，猛攻德軍陣綫，終未獲逞，最近十日內該區戰事沉寂，蓋蘇軍多已調至南路北翼作戰，德軍調生力軍進攻柯維爾，今已將該地列為德軍戰綫內障碍據點，蘇軍進攻該城北面，已為德軍砲火所擊潰，德軍之戰略陣地遂因之改善。</p>

<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　英政府為解救內外政局之困難，曾企圖改組內閣，艾登外相下野已大致決定，但路透社八日電稱，首相邱吉爾決定延期改組內閣。據觀測邱吉爾首相所以驟變方針，乃因英美外交會談及英帝國首相會議均將分別於倫敦舉行，此際若更迭英外交政策之最高首腦頗不適宜。</p>

<p>三月二十九日報載棉布商承辦臨時戶口布配給辦法已公佈，受配各布不得拒絕選購，謂全國商業統制總會為應巿民需要決定，先行辦理棉布臨時配給，現已將棉布臨時配給數量及價格，呈准行政院核定幷已製就「購布證」一種，即將發由巿政府依照辦理戶口米配給辦法，按尸每人發給購布證一張，每張配售棉布一丈五尺，憑向指定之棉布零售商號付款選購云云，市民需求孔亟，行見實行之期將屆！</p>
<p>自上海地區之棉紗棉布收買法令公佈後，各紗布商紗執存之紗布，均未能越雷池一步，聽候收買檢收，祗以儲藏倉棧日久，發生變質者甚多，其原因為貨物堆置時間長久，空氣不予流通，或以房屋建築簡陋，上漏下濕，潮氣蘊塞，或以棉布加工質料起化學作用，或以綑件箱板及鐵皮破碎，或以管理不善，致布質起霉爛，脆弱、（尤以硫化元色為甚）退色，器傷，蟲蝕，鼠嚙，水漬，破洞，汚　等等劣品，零售商號以保留額之布疋，及向批發商聯營處申請配給所得之棉布，內中如有上述劣質者，彼以血本所關，自必配售巿民，屆時以配給額所限，又無從退貨掉換，則過去市民嘗到黃泥煤球，又將給累於市民，際茲戰時物資缺乏，升斗小民寄望於棉布配給者久矣！而所配售所得若為劣質棉布，制裁衣服，再加縫工工資，穿着一次，立見破　，使市民無端損失，　害市民，誰尸其警？</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>安定民心，充裕國庫，誰都希望的，但要達到這兩大目的，在戰爭體制下，物資缺乏時，政府必需施行物資統制，公定限價配給。目前世界各國，早巳雷厲風行，辦理最完善而嚴格化的，首推友邦日本，雖站在大東亞戰爭第一綫，他們的國庫仍然充裕，民心很是安定，人人都抱着勝戰的決心，這是甚麽緣故呢？</p>
<p>要知道實行統制，事前必須有縝密的調査，正確的統計工作，然後着手辦理統制，始得良好的成績。回顧吾國，雖感物資缺乏，實行統制配給，為安定民心，充裕國庫，當前急務，但施行統制以來，庶間民心安定嗎？國庫充裕嗎？蓋因祗知統制，不知統計之重要。凡物初無精確之統計，如何知道配量之多寡，至於稅入的多少，亦無從預算，以至當局一聲統配，經辦人員，趨之若驚，鑽頭覓縫，賄賂運動，賣官　爵，各盡其能。</p>
<p>又政府每辦一統制配給因無詳細的統計，往往招商認辦，利用承包制而其稅收數目毫無標準，以至辦理人員朦蔽政府，以多報少，濫收漏規，放縱承包人，配給仍變黑巿出售等情形，這樣民心何得安定！國庫何得充裕！政治何得光明！國家何得强盛！</p>
<p>統而言之，要行統配必先縝密統計，欲得詳確統計，必須培養統計人才。分別將各地各物的產量和消耗，編成精確數字，公報週知，然後辦理統制嚴格化，實是求是，改革承包制，劃除貪汚，嚴懲舞弊，提高公務人員待遇，獎勵生產，物價始得眞眞壓平，國家經濟始得道入正軌，完遂戰爭，國泰民安，即可實現。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Rise and Fall of Shanghai: Shanghai Residents Have a Responsibility <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in this newspaper's Sunday commentary, Mr. Funatsu cited two sentences from Gu Tinglin, a great Confucian scholar of the late Ming Dynasty: "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual."  He concluded by saying, "The rise and fall of Shanghai is the responsibility of Shanghai residents." As we reflect on the wisdom revealed by our virtuous predecessors, and considering our position as residents of Shanghai, we have a great deal to contemplate.  Mr. Funatsu, a "Friend of China" who has lived in China for fifty-six years, is familiar with all things Chinese.  The Shanghai residents he refers to naturally include all citizens residing in Shanghai.  He compared the sense of responsibility that Japanese people have towards their country with that of Chinese people and concluded that the Japanese sense of responsibility is more widespread and fervent. This is based on his daily interactions and observations, and is by no means a subjective and arbitrary judgement.  However, how rich in meaning is the sense of responsibility towards the country that our virtuous predecessor Gu Tinglin conveyed in his saying, "The rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every individual"!  Today, there are still many people in society who "abandon responsibility and stand idly by," which is especially shameful.</p>
<p>However, the times and environment are, after all, constantly changing, innovating, and progressing. The work of the nation and society requires people to adapt to the times and the environment at all times to cope with challenges.  A passive, "detached from the world" attitude of abandoning responsibility will only increase the severity of environmental deterioration.  We must open our eyes, value reality, and work together to open up the environment and improve it.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly spoken of the importance of Shanghai's position; we have also repeatedly pointed out the crises facing Shanghai from all sides.  It is gratifying to note that the municipal authorities are paying close attention to this issue.  Strengthening political power has revealed a glimmer of hope for the future, such as the recent personnel adjustments made by the municipal government to strengthen itself and the preparations for the establishment of a municipal advisory committee.  If a path of cooperation between officials and the people can be established and they advance together, then the strengthening of political power in the shortest possible time can be predicted.  From what we know, Mayor Chen has lofty ambitions for Shanghai's municipal administration and is open-minded, accepting and considering opinions that are beneficial to the entire city of Shanghai. This is the best opportunity for those who sincerely care about Shanghai to contribute their strength, and they should especially not be timid and abandon their responsibilities.</p>
<p>We believe that in addition to strengthening political power, the most pressing issues facing Shanghai at present are public security and the economy.  In terms of public security, strengthening the police force is of course necessary. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen the police force, improve the effectiveness of police service, improve the lives of police officers, and organize police consumer cooperatives in order to strengthen public security.  From the perspective of public security, the organization of cooperatives is naturally the responsibility of the citizens themselves and cannot be shirked.  Furthermore, the maintenance of public security is closely related to the financial, industrial, commercial, and wealthy sectors.  If wealthy individuals hire a bodyguard, they make sure he is well-fed so he can perform his duties faithfully; how can the police, who protect the public interest, not be well-fed so that they can provide loyal service?  Therefore, the extent to which the police consumer cooperative progresses smoothly can be a test of the extent to which social leaders care about the public good.</p>
<p>As for the economic issue, this newspaper has also repeatedly stated that it should not be strengthened by imposing controls, but rather by strengthening regulations. At the same time, the strength of the economic police force should be strengthened, and the economic administrative organs of the city should be unified as soon as possible to clarify the unreasonable phenomena in the economy.  We often hear that public officials in a few agencies use coercive means to overcharge or make extra demands on citizens or merchants. The government authorities should specify detailed penalties for corruption and punish offenders severely. When necessary, they should organize units to specifically accept reports from citizens, welcome reports from citizens, or entrust the citizens' welfare association to handle them.  If citizens encounter such situations, they must not secretly endure them, but should report them to the relevant authorities. If they secretly offer bribes and fail to report them, they should be subject to the same penalties as those who accept bribes and engage in corruption once discovered.</p>
<p>The government authorities must invigorate themselves, and the citizens must also invigorate themselves. Only by invigorating ourselves together can we overcome Shanghai's crisis and complete the task of building a new Shanghai. Everyone who lives in Shanghai has a share of the responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Army Continues to Clean Up the Remaining Enemy Near Kohima; Mountbatten Admits the Situation is Becoming Serious <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, April 9 (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from the Indian front on the 9th: After completely capturing Kohima on the morning of the 6th, the Japanese army continued to pursue the defeated enemy and is currently engaged in a heroic annihilation battle near Kohima.  One unit of the Japanese army advanced from the east of Kohima to the north of Kohima, and occupied the high ground to the west on the afternoon of the 6th, cutting off the enemy's retreat. Another unit marched north from the south of Kohima, clearing out the remaining enemy near Kohima and continuing to pursue them rapidly to the north of Kohima. Another unit reached the west side of the Kohima to Dimapur highway and completely secured the key points of the highway on the 7th, cutting off the retreat of the enemy in that area.  The enemy army was in a chaotic state of disarray due to the Japanese army's surprise attack and fierce offensive, and is currently attempting to escape to the northwest. Furthermore, the Japanese army's encirclement has been completed, so the enemy army has no way to break through. If the thousands of enemy troops do not surrender, they will only be annihilated.</p>
<p>Lisbon, April 9 (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Mountbatten stated on the 8th that the battles being fought by the anti-Axis forces in the hilly areas overlooking the Imphal plain are an important area. After repelling the Japanese-Indian army, the anti-Axis forces' positions in the area have been improved. He tried his best to cover up the fact that the overall situation was deteriorating and that the Japanese-Indian army had occupied Kohima. However, well-informed sources in New Delhi pointed out that the Japanese army had advanced to a point 64 kilometers inside Indian territory and said that Kohima was only 40 kilometers from the Angara-Assam railway, and they were quite worried about the current situation.</p>
<p>5,000 British Troops Surrounded in the Gaza Area</p>
<p>Tokyo, April 8 (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese army base on the India-Burma front: The Japanese army's Tani Unit has surrounded approximately 5,000 enemy troops in the Indaw (60 kilometers southwest of Gaza) and Moelu (50 kilometers northwest of Gaza) areas and began attacking them on the 6th. Another unit of the Japanese army attacked Indaw, defeated the enemy troops in the northern part of the area, and pursued the defeated enemy rapidly towards Inlu, compressing the encirclement net at a point one kilometer east of Moelu and launching a fierce offensive. Another Japanese army unit also began operations from a certain direction, pursuing the enemy troops operating in the area. It has now advanced to Moelu, three kilometers east of Moelu. A powerful unit of the Japanese army in the Mohyin area is also responding to this and pursuing the enemy troops from the north. The Japanese air force is working closely with the ground forces, fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in Kolat, and continuously bombing the enemy air force's kamikaze air transport bases in Shirkiya and Imphal for several days. They intercepted and repelled enemy fighter planes escorting these two airfields along the way. A major air route annihilation battle is currently underway in that area.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Basic Strategy Has Been Completely Shattered</p>
<p>Tokyo, April 8 (Central News Agency) - The Japanese-Indian army has surrounded the enemy's stronghold of Imphal from three directions in eastern India, and the fall of Imphal is only a matter of time. The Japanese-Indian army broke into the city of Kohima on the morning of the 6th and completely occupied the area. Kohima is a key point on the Assam-Bengal railway, located only 50 kilometers from Dimapur. The fall of Kohima poses a major threat to the Assam-Bengal railway.</p>
<p>The Japanese-Indian army began attacking the hilly area on February 8, encircling and annihilating the various units of the British-Indian Fourth Army on the Indian border defense line, and advanced to the Imphal plain, completely shifting the enemy's attention to the Imphal front. During this period, the Japanese-Indian army crossed the Gengdiwan River on the 15th, constructing roads in the mountains and forests at an altitude of 8,000 meters to continue their advance, shattering the enemy's will to fight, and then advanced to the vicinity of Kohima and occupied the area. As a result, the supply routes for the Stilwell army operating in the Fukong area and the enemy's air transport units in Gaza and Moini Imphal have been completely cut off and they are isolated. The enemy's dream of opening the Ledo Road has ultimately come to naught. At the same time, key points on the Tinsukia and Ledo railway lines and the air transport base for Chongqing cannot function. The enemy's basic strategy of strengthening its combat power on the Chinese mainland and attacking the Japanese army from both the Pacific and Chinese mainland is impossible to realize.</p>

<p>Bangkok, April 9 (Central News Agency) - Thai Prime Minister Pibul sent a telegram to Subhas Chandra Bose, Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, on the 7th, congratulating him on the Indian National Army's march into the motherland and its future success. The telegram read as follows: "Dear Indian compatriots, today the Indian National Army under the command of Mr. Bose has entered India to liberate the motherland. This is a cause for deep celebration for all the people of Asia. At this time of decisive battle, I, on behalf of the Thai people, express my admiration for the Indian National Army and pray that the Indian National Army will continue to advance towards the motherland to achieve the final victory for righteousness."</p>
<h3 id="e5">India's War of Liberation Will Surely Achieve its Goal; Italian Chairman Publishes Article <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, April 7 (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Rome, Italian newspapers published an article on the 4th written by Chairman Mussolini titled "India for the Indians," emphasizing the significance of the Japanese-Indian army's operations in East India, saying that the operation has had a major impact on the war and is an unprecedented event in world history. The great task of India's liberation cannot be undertaken solely by the internal national movement or the Indian National Army; it must be achieved in cooperation with the Japanese army. When the anti-Axis forces on the Indian border are defeated, Prime Minister Tojo's claim that "India for the Indians" will surely intensify the Indian national movement and allow India to break away from British oppression as soon as possible. Since the rebellion of 1857, the Indian independence movement has made considerable progress despite many sacrifices. Although the programs of the various factions in the movement are not completely consistent, their aim of expelling British forces is consistent. Although Gandhi's non-cooperation movement failed to solve the issue of Indian independence, the significance of the issue has been clarified to the world. Now, with the cooperation of the Japanese army, India has begun to attack foreign troops who are mistreating Indians. The Italians and the Axis powers stand on the same front, so they are extremely concerned about the progress of the Indian independence movement.</p>

<h3 id="e8">The Nanjing Tobacco Prohibition Bureau Thoroughly Implements Tobacco Prohibition; Announces Four Policy Guidelines <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, April 9 (Central News Agency) - Nanjing is the capital of the country, and every political measure strives for perfection. Therefore, after the authorities formally promulgated the Tobacco Prohibition Ordinance, they immediately began to organize the Nanjing District Local Tobacco Prohibition Bureau to gradually eliminate the harm of tobacco poisoning in Nanjing, in order to promote the health of the people's physique and the long-term preservation of the national lifeline. The bureau was formally established in this month after active preparations. In order to clarify the bureau's future tobacco prohibition policy and various measures to eliminate the harm of tobacco poisoning, this reporter visited the person in charge of the bureau yesterday and was given a detailed explanation. The following is a record of each point:</p>
<p>In order to thoroughly solve the fundamental problem of tobacco prohibition, the government authorities repeatedly conducted detailed discussions and formulated plans. According to the entire plan, Nanjing District's tobacco prohibition policy can also be divided into four points, which will be implemented step by step: Registration of tobacco addicts. The government authorities, considering that some tobacco addicts have been trapped in this extremely harmful situation for more than just one day and that the poison cannot be eliminated in a short period of time, have decided that the first thing to do is registration. Then, according to the actual situation, strict rationing will be carried out, and private purchases and smoking will not be allowed. After an appropriate period of time, rationing will be gradually reduced in order to guide them to quit. Adjustment of opium dens. All county-level opium dens will also be strictly adjusted in the future. The goods sold each month will be allocated by the government, and illegal buying and selling will not be allowed in order to seek ill-gotten gains. Suppressing smuggling. In addition to strictly suppressing the private transportation of opium, the planting of tobacco seedlings in remote and desolate areas will also be strictly prohibited. Once discovered, a warning will be given immediately. Those who disobey in secret will be investigated and punished according to the law. Quitting. The positive goal of the government's promulgation of tobacco prohibition is to quit. Therefore, central and local governments have established hospitals to help people quit without suffering. Those who are able to pay the fees will do so according to their circumstances; those who are unable to pay the fees may be exempted according to their circumstances, so that they can escape the sea of suffering and regain their healthy bodies. Currently, the director of this bureau is upholding the government's intentions and working hard in cooperation. However, there are still shortcomings, and assistance from all sectors is needed.</p>

<p>Lisbon, April 9 (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, according to a London source: British political circles believe that US Under Secretary of State Stettinius' visit to Britain is a prelude to another meeting of Roosevelt and Churchill. However, London and Washington want to resolve the outstanding issues between Britain and the United States before meeting with Stalin again, so as to avoid repeating the mistake of negotiating separately with the Soviet Union at the Tehran Conference last year. London political circles believe that this is the reason for the US Under Secretary of State's visit to Britain this time. Roosevelt and Churchill have already invited Stalin to the meeting, but have not yet received Stalin's reply.</p>

<p>Stockholm, April 9 (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line sources: German troops are continuing to shorten their lines east and northeast of Odessa, and the Soviets are following in an attempt to encircle Odessa, so the situation in that area is becoming increasingly serious. Soviet troops are moving south from northwest of Odessa and are engaged in fierce fighting with German troops. German troops stationed in the northern suburbs of Odessa are also engaged in fierce fighting with the Soviet vanguard.

<p>Berlin, April 9 (Central News Agency), Huitong News Agency: The recent situation on the Eastern Front is that the German army has launched an offensive in the northern sector on the Narva River, the Soviet army has repeatedly attacked the German army's obstacle positions in the Odessa area, and the German army has made continuous advances in Cernauti, Tarnopol, Brody, and Kovel. The German army's offensive in the Narva area is mainly aimed at the remnants of the Soviet bridgehead on the left bank of the Narva River southwest of the city, while the Soviet army is again attempting to break into the area south of Lake Peipus. The fierce fighting south of Lake Peipus has been going on for many days. The location is southeast of Ostrov, and the Soviet army's strategy is to forcibly break into the German army's positions towards the Baltic states. Unfortunately, the Soviet army has continued to attack the German lines without success, sacrificing manpower. The fighting in the area has been quiet for the past ten days, as most of the Soviet troops have been transferred to the northern wing of the southern sector. The German army has transferred fresh troops to attack Kovel, and has now listed the area as a defensive strongpoint within the German lines. The Soviet army's attack on the north side of the city has been repulsed by German artillery fire, and the German army's strategic positions have been improved as a result.</p>

<p>Before the incident, tax revenue in Zhejiang Province accounted for a large proportion of income, mainly from production and sales taxes. Currently, various production and sales taxes on bamboo and wood, paper, medicinal materials, cotton and hemp, fur, etc., have been renamed business special taxes and are being carried out in order, with collection as usual. Among them, bamboo and wood is a very considerable item because of the vigorous production, and the tax revenue is of course considerable. However, the contractor only pays about 400,000 yuan to the provincial treasury every month, which is quite different from the actual amount collected. Therefore, various departments have suggested that the provincial government retender the contract.</p>

<p>It has been found that various municipal taxes should be declared and paid by the taxpayers themselves in accordance with the regulations. Previously, due to environmental constraints, staff members were assigned to collect taxes. Now that municipal administration has entered the right track, a thorough rectification should be carried out to emphasize tax collection. It is now determined that from the summer of the 33rd year, all shops in the urban area should pay all kinds of taxes. They are required to personally go to the collection office in each district to declare and pay the amount that should be paid within the time limit in accordance with the approved number. No additional staff will be assigned to collect taxes outside in order to eliminate malpractices. In addition to issuing orders and sending staff to review them at any time, a public announcement is made to all shops to be aware of their own interests and honestly declare and pay taxes within the time limit. Do not collude to underreport or delay, which may result in penalties. This announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e33">After Unified Management by the Authorities, Price Trends Are Balanced - Average Drop of 35 Percent <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Since the competent authorities in this city have taken strict measures to uniformly manage prices, general speculative merchants have suffered serious threats. Therefore, the overall price trend in this city has turned into a calm state. According to the person in charge of each industry association yesterday:</p>
<p>According to the prices of various goods a month ago, as of yesterday, there has been a continued drop of an average of about 35 percent. However, although merchants holding goods cannot obtain the full extra profit at that time, the current profit is still quite substantial, because the price was very low when they purchased the goods in the past. However, some small-scale operators have been slightly hit, because they do not purchase much goods, and the prices vary depending on when they replenish their stock. Some shops have had their sales limited because they exceeded the limited price, and were found by the authorities and subjected to punishment or fines. However, each industry association believes that supervising the buying and selling of fellow traders is its responsibility, and has separately notified and urged each member to buy and sell in accordance with the regulations and not to exceed the agreed price, violating the purpose of the authorities' management of prices. As for the various types of goods stored in warehouses, the holders should gradually release the goods to the market and should not hoard them for a long time. Therefore, when the goods are negotiated and sold, a transaction document must be issued by both the buyer and the seller, which should clearly state: 　Name of goods, 　Quantity, 　Price, 　Date of transaction, 　Storage location, 　Name of the seller's shop and the name of the person in charge, 　Name of the buyer's shop and the name of the person in charge, so that the authorities can request it for inspection during investigation and avoid future unexpected disputes.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Citizens Must Pay Attention to Inferior Goods When Purchasing Rationed Cloth <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Shouyuan</p>
<p>The March 29th newspaper reported that the temporary household cloth allocation method undertaken by cotton cloth merchants has been announced. Each cloth allocated must not refuse to purchase. It is said that the National Commercial Control Association has decided to handle the temporary allocation of cotton cloth in advance in response to the needs of the people. The amount and price of the temporary allocation of cotton cloth have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and a "Cloth Purchase Certificate" has been produced. It will be issued by the municipal government in accordance with the household rice allocation method. Each household will be issued a cloth purchase certificate, and each certificate will allocate one foot and five feet of cotton cloth, which can be purchased by paying at the designated cotton cloth retail store. The people urgently need it and the date of implementation is approaching!</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Shanghai area cotton yarn and cotton cloth purchase law, the yarn and cloth stored by each yarn and cloth merchant have not been able to take a step beyond the boundaries. They are waiting for purchase and inspection. However, many of the items stored in warehouses for a long time have deteriorated. The reason is that the goods have been piled up for a long time, the air is not circulating, or the building is simple, the top leaks and the bottom is wet, and the moisture is blocked, or the cotton cloth processing material undergoes chemical action, or the bundled box boards and iron sheets are broken, or the management is poor, causing the cloth to become moldy, fragile, (especially sulfide base colors), fade, device damage, insect erosion, rat bites, water stains, holes, stains, and other inferior products. The retail stores retain a certain amount of cloth, and the cotton cloth obtained by applying for allocation from the joint operation office of the wholesalers, if there are any of the above-mentioned inferior products, they will definitely allocate them to the people because they are related to their blood capital. At that time, due to the limited allocation amount, and there is no way to return or exchange the goods, the past citizens who tasted yellow mud briquettes will again be tired of the people. At this time, there is a lack of wartime materials, and the small people rely on the cotton cloth allocation for a long time! And if the allocated goods are inferior cotton cloth, making clothes, plus sewing labor costs, wearing them once will see them broken, causing the people to lose money for no reason, harming the people. Who will be their warning?</p>
<p>I deeply hope that the wise authorities will understand the truth for this temporary household cloth allocation method, and make appropriate preparations before the household allocation is implemented to prevent malpractices and benefit the people.</p>
<h3 id="e37">Control and Statistics <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Stabilizing people's hearts and enriching the national treasury are what everyone hopes for, but to achieve these two major goals, under the war system, when resources are scarce, the government must implement resource control, publicly determine limited prices and allocations. Currently, all countries in the world have been vigorously implementing this. The best and most strict implementation is Japan, an allied country. Although standing on the front line of the Greater East Asia War, their national treasury is still abundant, the people's hearts are very stable, and everyone holds the determination to win the war. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>To know that to implement control, there must be a thorough investigation and correct statistical work beforehand, and then start to handle the control in order to achieve good results. Looking back at our country, although we feel that resources are lacking, it is an urgent task to implement control and allocation to stabilize people's hearts and enrich the national treasury. However, since the implementation of control, have the people's hearts been stable? Is the national treasury enriched? This is because we only know the importance of control, but do not know the importance of statistics. If there are no accurate statistics for any goods, how can we know the amount of allocation? As for the amount of tax revenue, it is also impossible to budget. As a result, when the authorities make an allocation, the staff are shocked and try to find loopholes, bribe and campaign, and sell official titles.</p>
<p>Also, every time the government handles a control allocation, because there are no detailed statistics, it often invites merchants to recognize and handle it, using the contracting system, and the tax revenue has no standard. As a result, the handlers deceive the government, report more and less, collect extra fees, indulge contractors, and the allocation still becomes a black market sale. In this way, how can people's hearts be stable! How can the national treasury be enriched! How can politics be bright! How can the country be strong!</p>
<p>In short, to implement allocation, thorough statistics must be done first. To obtain accurate statistics, statistical talents must be cultivated. Compile the production and consumption of local goods into accurate figures, publish them to the public, and then implement strict control, seeking truth from facts, reforming the contracting system, eliminating corruption, severely punishing fraud, raising the salaries of civil servants, and encouraging production. Only then can prices be truly flattened, and the national economy can be put on the right track to complete the war and achieve national peace and security.</p>
