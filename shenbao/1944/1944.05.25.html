<p>社評</p>
<h3>健全人事</h3>
<p>政府為增强戰時行政效率，最近發表省行政機構改革方案，結束各部駐滬辦事處，並將各特別市的糧食局合倂於經濟局。同時，聞政府將對所屬各機關公務員，一面裁汰冗閒，一面提高待遇。從增强戰時行政效率而言，確為賢明德適切措置；在此物價高漲聲中，一方面使行政簡素化，一方面改善公務人員的待遇，也確是裨益於革新政治的一件事。</p>
<p>政治制度的不良，行政機關的重複，雖然都是促使政治不上正軌的原因，但更主要的，還在於「人事的不健全」。所以，從是具備了優良的制度和嚴密的機構，如果沒有健全的人事去推動，去實行，結果依然落空的。一切制度原是死的，一切機構原是空的。舉例而言：統治經濟的理論和制度，都是非常正確的，尤在戰時，統制經濟更為重要，世界各國，中日德等國固不必論，即如英美等一向是自由主義經濟的國家，到現在也不得不採取統制政策。但是統制經濟的理論和制度，一旦在中國實施以後，情形又完全不同、一部分貪官污吏把統制經濟當作掌握經濟實權的機會，而認為是致富的捷徑，以致一部分管理統制的人，短時期內，私囊充盈；而被統制的人則壓迫日軍，怨聲載道。但是，當初統制經濟的目的，乃在平均分配必需物品，安定戰時人民生活，現在事實却與目的背道而馳，有弊而無利。試問：爲什麽統制經濟在德國能行得通？爲什麽配給制度在日本能辦的好？而在中國適得其反呢？這並不是統制經濟的理論錯誤，也不是配給制度本身的不良，癥結所在，還是人事的不健全。統制經濟如此，其他政治問題亦然。</p>
<p>日前大陸新報社評，論國府刷新吏治，頗為扼要，他說：「一而實施行政機構的簡素化，裁減冗員，一面改善有能力公務員的待遇，則恢復他們朝氣蓬勃的辦事精神，不是難事。但僅僅改善待遇，就希望從此自動的刷新吏治，那是很大的錯誤。改善待遇，雖是提高行政效率的條件與前提，但不能全賴乎此。一面尤須追求官吏的責任，貫澈信賞必罰的方針，刷新吏治才能完全實現。現在可說是確立這種風氣的絕好時期。」與我們向所主張的正復相同。</p>
<p>我們始終認為「健全人事」，為刷新新吏治，提高行政效率的先決條件，而改善待遇，不過是健全人事中的一點，其次為採用人才主義，追求官吏責任，貫澈必罰方針，都是極重要的項目，必須全面顛倒。希望政府在此講求戰時行政效率增强之時，重視健全人事的全面方法。</p>
<p>譯評</p>
<h3>國府刷新吏治</h3>
<p>國民政府為改善官吏待遇，正以財政部原案為基礎，研究具體方案，考慮米榖等物資俸給制度。要維持儲備券的價值，沒有再較此更妥善的方法了，且在物價漲無止境的現狀下，物價俸給可說是最實際的方法。但實施上實非常困難，當局自應慎重研究並充分準備。總之，國府一面合倂中央官署，撤銷駐滬辦事處，省行政機構簡單化，着手整理中央，地方的行政；一面更從事改善學校敎職員的待遇，安定公務員的生活，這是可喜的現象。公務員的生活無保證，談不到廉潔政治，責任政治。</p>
<p>我們趁此機會切盼國府更澈底使行政機構簡單化，增進行政能率。無論在中央，在地方，掛了一塊招牌而實際上並無活動的官署，機關，辦事處之類，仍為數頗多。用機構的完備來顯出中央政府威容的時期已經過去了。現在是切實要求配合參職中國的情況，實施簡單而有能率的行政運營之時期。必須排除寅緣情面，以國府的行政機構為中心，重行組織。同時，在執行事務上，亦不能採用略為潑辣的有效方法。所謂繁文褥禮，在公文堆裏過時日，形式的公文之起稿與往返，不是從費精力的傾向嗎？行政機構的簡單化，必須同時提高行政效率始有意義。國府對此點似亦應加以深思熟慮。</p>
<p>總之，在官吏之間振作積極的活動的風氣，並使有强烈的責任心，是目前所最迫切的。仍如以前這樣惡劣的條件待遇公務員，而向他們要求活動性，責任心，這是無理的。一面實施行政機構的簡單化，裁減冗員，一而改善有能力公務員的待遇，則恢復他們朝氣蓬勃的辦事精神，不是難事。但僅僅改善待遇，就希望能夠自動的刷新吏治，那是很大的錯誤。改善待遇，雖是提高行政效率的條件與前提，但不能全賴乎此。一面尤須追求官吏的責任，貫澈信賞必罰的方針，刷新吏治，才能完全實現。現在可說是確立這種風氣的絕好時期。切望國府當局努力，以慰喁喁之望。（冥：譯自五月二十二日大陸新報）</p>
<h3>哥希馬周圍激戰　日軍擊退敵反攻　中村大將評論印度洋戰局</h3>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　烏克魯爾之敵軍，為日軍攻擊，急於打開最後之血路，十六日以來敵猛烈進攻哥希馬公路之堪古拉頓基及東方各高地，計十六日兩次，十七日三次，十五日五次，日所在部隊以寡敵衆，不分晝夜，連續反擊，予敵以莫大損害，敵終不支潰退，十九日上午，於堪古拉頓基北方高地，擊毀敵戰車五輛，並破壞其他戰車十輛，重迫擊砲等甚多，敵反攻企圖均被粉碎。</p>
<p>仰光二十四日中央社電　英軍為援救伊姆法爾盆地被圍之第四軍，乃積極企圖打通迪馬普爾。哥希馬至伊姆法爾之公路，最近更於迪馬普爾方面增强兵力，同時，並以坦克車、飛機、大砲等機械化部隊，繼續向哥希馬周圍之日軍陣地反攻，尤以對五一〇二高地之反攻最為激烈。十九日拂曉，敵軍曾由喬特索曼茲布扎方面，作擾亂砲隊，並以坦克車十九輛作先導反攻，但終被日軍擊退，日軍第一綫之砲隊，更擊毀其坦克車五輛。又是日傍晚，敵軍曾以重坦克車一輛，野砲四門，進擊該高地西北方，日軍即以激烈之砲火射擊，其重坦克車中彈起火燃燒，故敵之反攻企圖已成泡影。又敵軍於空中運輸坦克車及砲兵部隊，向哥希馬西南一六三〇高地納爾海馬及龍古茲密等地增援，以期奪取哥希馬，目前各處均展開激戰，然因日軍之猛擊，敵已受挫。</p>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日海軍大將中村長三氏，與記者會見時，談及蒙特巴頓之印度洋作戰方式謂，迨入雨季之後，印緬之作戰將由陸上移至海上，其論述大要如次：美國將於太平洋作戰外，尙熱望打開經印度之援渝公路，同時並企圖發動機動部隊，結成經菲國到達中國大陸之中央進攻路，英國於客幾十月曾編程東南太平洋軍，直屬蒙特巴頓，然迄至今日，其所實行者，僅於敷衍之小規模前衛戰而已。然陸上之戰鬥於雨季時若演成交綏狀態時，海上軍隊之活動比較活潑，現在印敵艦隊之勢力雖不得詳知，據稱為以戰艦三四艘為基幹之艦隊，將來或能由地中海調來若干，僅以如此少數之艦隊頗難活動，蒙特巴頓不能發令活動、美國雖一再要求然其將來之活動，仍難超過空襲泗水等地之小規模舉動，蒙特巴頓軍之活動，與歐洲第二戰綫之結成問題，有密切之關聯，彼不能不顧第二戰綫，歐洲第二戰綫之開關，絕不能中途而　，屆時英國勢力之大部將全傾於此戰，若以英國自私之點觀之，東亞海上之作戰，將全委之於美國，果第二戰綫再度延期，蒙特巴頓軍或將於實力之範圍內開始轟動。總而言之，英海軍於印度洋之實力不甚健全，敵軍之轟動，亦不足介意，此與北方阿留地安方面之敵軍作戰相同，欲期發揮牽制作戰以上之效果，頗屬難能，故日軍堅固防禦之下，亦不足顧慮也。</p>
<h3>日大東亞省　優待留學生</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　大東亞省决自五月初旬起，對大東亞共榮圈各國之留學生，除配給規定之食物，蔬菜外，並適應各該國之習慣，增加配給脂肪類等之副食物。青木大東亞大臣十七、十八兩日分赴國際學友會（南方），日華學會（中國），善隣學會（蒙古），日泰學院（泰印度等）留學生指導機關訪問及視察留學生生活情形。同時並召集三團體留學生訓話，大意謂：希各生一面研究學問，一面須認識眞正治日本，務使日本與大東亞各國緊密協力，雖因物質關係，感有種種不便，日本當决克服此種困難，日本為解放東亞，歷盡艱難，諸君對其精神，尤須深刻認識。</p>
<h3>日海底隧道　複綫工事　决定提前竣工</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日下關之門司之海底鐵道隧道複綫工作，前以十月一日開通為目標，急速進行工事，但由於緊密輸送重要物資之要請，茲已决定提前開通，刻正加緊工作，對敷設軌道中之新綫穿通工事，定於八月中旬完成，當即開始運行，同時對更作現在之隧下軌道其他工事，亦均於一個月內完成，是以待望已久之複綫開通綫，以九月二十五日為期開始運行，刻正傾注全力加緊工事。</p>
<h3>泰國新首都　積極建設中　農產物亦正努力增產</h3>
<p>盤古二十四日中央社電　泰國新首都培查布恩奠基典禮，已於上月末在畢本首相夫婦臨席下隆重舉行，培查布恩於盤古北方約三百　公里，略居泰國中央部，東西北三面繞山，乃一南北長百公里，東西長三十公里之盆地，泰新首都即於此地區分散建設。按舊</p>
<p>培查布恩</p>
<p>僅為一山間小村鎮，但被奠為新首都後，各地住民即陸續　榮，現在住民已達五萬，以盤古景邁鐵路之薩邦賓站為起點，寬達七米之公路業已完成，此外，各地間亦紛紛建設公路。據培查布恩市當局宣稱：為備將來人口增加，刻正努力增產農產物，該地土質頗適種蔗，白米，玉蜀黍及栽培烟草果實等。又電燈，自來水，製冰等工廠之建設，亦逐次具體化，並自四月三日起發行週刊新聞，欲將集中於盤古之泰國政治，軍事，經濟等各機關悉數移往培查布恩，事實雖不可能，雖泰政府對新首都之建設頗具熱意，今後之發展，實堪期待。</p>
<h3>日農商省設置　食糧增產部　集官民總力澈底達成</h3>
<p>東京二十四日中央社電　日農商省為期集結官民總力，澈底達成食糧增產之目的，决於該省及地方官廳設置戰時食糧增產本部。關於此事，二十三日閣議時，內田農商相會報告如次：增產本部係設置於農商省，地方本部係設置於地方官廳，中央本部由農商大臣，地方本部由地方長官就任部長，中央本部之主要任務，在求技術指導之伸縮性及實施李力動員計，同時並與農業報國聯盟結成一體，以期共同活動，並將農業報國隊亦置於本部長之統轄下，以期工作之緊密化。一方為與關聯之其他各省關係當局磋商促進對策，特於農商省設置戰時食糧協議會，以檢討及處置增產上必要之資材與配給消費諸關係問題。又為響應戰時食糧增產本部之設立，東部省特組織食糧生產學生挺身隊，計動員農科系大學五校，專門學校十四校學生至各地農場，以為食糧增產隊之幹部，實行增產報國工作。</p>
<h3>談中原戰局</h3>
<p>— 壁光</p>
<p>甲：最近的河南戰事，引人注意，茲請一述戰局大勢如何？</p>
<p>乙：這次河南戰事，重慶方面亦已承認遭受重大打擊。就戰局以觀自以京漢全綫的打通和控制，最為重要。日本華北華中兩軍部隊，於本月九日在京漢綫大站確山會師。華北日軍開始動作以來，不過二十日，已迭下鄉州許昌等重要城市，華中日軍自信陽方面與北軍呼應，出師北上，僅一週間即完成打通京漢路的作戰目標。華中華北日軍會師以後，戰局即向西延展，今日軍已經突入洛陽，一部且已進過潼關。中原戰爭的主動權，已完全落在日軍掌握了。</p>
<p>甲：日軍這次作戰，最大的成果，似乎還在國際政治上得影響？</p>
<p>乙：誠然，在河南作戰以前，渝共都在宣傳什麽「六月反攻」，大有和英美渝軍對緬甸作戰及美軍在太平洋之作戰互相呼應的聲勢。而且事實上，最近中國戰塲，顯有重大變化，重慶的美國空軍增强，妄想以中國大陸為基地而轟炸日本本土。特別可注意的是一向注力於浙閩等省沿海基地建設的美國空軍，最近企圖向華北及西北活動。以闌州，天水，寶雞，漢中等為後方基地，而以西安，洛陽，盧氏，安康，內鄉，老河口等為前進基地，顯有進攻華北進而擾及日本後方的野心。經過這次河南戰役，美與方面這種野心已經完全粉碎，對於國際戰局影響之大，從可想見。</p>
<p>甲：純粹從軍事上觀察，這一次戰爭有何重大意義。</p>
<p>乙：粉碎所謂六月反攻計劃，這是國際時局上同時也是軍事上第一個收獲。第二，便是以勝利的事實證明在渝美國空軍之無用，毫不足為渝軍臂助。第三，便是重慶誇耀為「整訓數年」「準備反攻」的「中央精銳」遭到崩潰的命運。僅以登封西北一段而言，渝方第八十五，及第廿九軍兵力約七萬以上，瀕於全部潰滅狀態。第四，日軍佔領了河南乃至全國軍事上重要點地？並且取得今後作戰的主動權。第五，中共各軍，近來在華北有展開大規模游擊策動的趨勢，經此河南一役，使其後方遭受威脅，而華中的新四軍又一向與華北共軍相互呼應，這次河南作戰之後，八路軍和新四軍已失去連絡。所以，這一戰役，對於整個中國戰局，是具有決定的意義的。</p>
<p>甲：所謂決定的意義，是否指對於政治也有相當影響？</p>
<p>乙：這也是很明顯的。第一，在重慶方面，最近幾年來所用以維緊民心的，便是所謂「積極準備反攻」和「接近最後勝利」。同時以河南前綫為屏障，盡力於計劃及推進所謂「西北建設」運動，對中共陝甘甯邊區的封鎖，新疆政治之重慶化、甘、甯青海回民之懷　等等，都在英美唆使之下推進中。河南一戰，日軍直逼潼關，西北之屏落已撤，「建設」更無說起，而豫戰之失敗，更是以動搖後方人心，悲觀失望的情緒將更强烈。第二，在和平區方面，政治領域積極擴展，包括安徽河南沃野之大部分，如從刷新政治，改善民生入手，則影響更所及，足以使渝方民心，益發傾向和平。</p>
<p>甲：我認為似乎經濟上得意義，也很重大，因為京漢路已經打通，和平區域擴大，華中華北間的物質交流可以更運　和　有效地推進。不久之後，進而貫通粵漢鐵路，　　僅華　與華南即對南　　易也不無相當期待　。</p>
<p>乙：誠如所言，　　本為我民族發展上最古的根據地，無產豐　，其中最主要的是農產品之小麥，大豆，棉花，和鑛產之煤及其他重要軍需資源。現在主要交通綫都在日軍掌握，而日、日軍佔領京漢隴海兩路以後，多年來成為關係數千萬民命的黃河治水工程，可以在盟部技術的指導與協力之下，積極發動，今後對於中原民生乃至經濟建設，自奉更大的期待。前冬及去年春夏間河南大旱矣的慘況，即便善忘的上海人士似乎也是印象尙深吧！我們　望有關當局重此機會連謀一勞永逸之計。</p>
<p>甲：不錯。誠能在日軍這樣戰績之下，立即由國府推進仁政，使我中原數百乃至數千萬同胞，於天災兵　之後，得慶更生，共謀蘇復，而促成全面和平，一方面又可協力盟軍，分任其勞，及早完成大東亞戰爭之勝利。</p>

<h3>上海區食米移動當局令撤銷限制　並擬訂京滬食米措置綱要</h3>
<p>南京二十四日中央社電政府富局為調節民食，前曾規定三省兩市食米移動限制辦法，自實施以來，民食得以無虞。茲因米統會收買工作漸次進展，而各地米價間有高低縣殊，致民食供給，有失圓滑。為　除此種現象，殊有將各地米價加以均衡之必要，故政府當局特將戰時物　移動暫行取締條例第六條，運至上海地區統制綫內應得商統會許可之物資中，食米一項刪除，以緩和上海地區流制綫之食米移動統制。同時為充裕京滬兩市民食，並擬訂「京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要」，規定凡運往京滬之米糧，除應由米統會微購者外，其餘部分可自由賣資，但違法操　希圖囤積者，决予以嚴懲。此艦意義，不但可使食米來源可以暢通，而各地米價，亦得有合理調節。尤其對京滬兩市目前嚴重之民食問題，可得有一適當解决方策，於民生安定上，裨益實大，當局此項措置　方關係當局亦採同一方針，對日本僑商違反者，决予以嚴處。對我國方面之施策，則加適當協力，故望一般民衆，及米商深體政府意旨，協力施策推行，米統會及米糧同業公會，更應發揮自洽精神，從事食米採辦工作，以使供求平衡，價格穩定，完成安定民生之重任。關於此事，行政院周副院長，及日大使館當局，特於二十四日發表重要談話。又日駐華派遣軍總司令，中國方面艦隊司令官，駐華持命全權大使，亦於同日正式發表，茲分誌如下：</p>
<p>周副院長談話</p>
<p>政府前為集中管理調節民食起見，曾對三省兩市之食米移動，加以限制。今米糧統制委員會之收買工作漸次進展，各地米價復有均衡之必要，特先就戰時物資移動取締暫行條例第六條，運至上海地區統制機內，應得全國商　統制總會許可之物資中，將米一項明令刪除，責令米糧統制委員會擴大發給護照之範圍，傳正當米商及農民　俱得圓滑搬入。此舉意在緩和上海地區　制綫食米移動之限制，在合理的管理下，通暢食米來源，更進而調節米價，使一般農民，集中生產，都市農村兩受其益。此後仍由米統會及米糧同業公會，發揮其自治精神，從事於食米之採辦，務使供求適應，價格穩定。至於現行配給制度，亦有政善之必要，現已擬定京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要，對於上海方面先行實施，惟限制緩和而後，或有違反法令，乘機操縱，貪　利益，妄希　積者，仍由主管當局嚴厲取締，一經查獲，決按法重懲。事關安定民生，尙望一般民衆體念斯旨，協助政府推進管理施策。　　京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要</p>
<p>本綱要在統制原則下，鴛充裕兩市之食米規定之。　　　凡米統會核准之採辦商，及京滬兩市已登記之米店，及附近農民，將自己收穫之米榖，運至市區內銷售，均得向米統會申請搬運米榖護照。但米統會按照成數徵購軍警，及重要產業等項用米，其徵購成數，規定如左：（甲）採辦商已繳消原訂成單者，徵購百分之二十。（乙）採辦商未繳淸原訂成單者，徵購百分之四十。（丙）採辦商未訂成單，或新加入者，微購百分之三十。　　　微購米榖之收買價格，除第一條乙項另有規定者外，按照實際成本，附加合理利潤，隨時規定之。　　　凡運往京滬兩市之米糧，除應由米統會微購者外，其餘部份得以自由價格買賣之。但為防止囤積及暴利，其買賣範圍，由市政府會同米統會另訂之。</p>
<p>茍無米絲會護照而搬入米穀時，以私米論，按照中央法令懲處之。</p>
<p>米統會在京滬兩市指定搬入口，設臨時辦發　照處。並得臨時對未經請領護照之米商，給以般運護照。</p>
<p>上述護照，統由米統會按照原頒申請發給米　採辦證，及米　搬運議照辦法給之。</p>
<p>本綱要呈行政院核准施行，修改時亦同。</p>
<p>日當局發表</p>
<p>民國三十二年三月十一日，制定之長江下游地域物資移動政締暫行規則頃修正如次，即日施行。</p>
<p>附表第一中第三號物資，「限向上海地區搬運之物資」中將「米」（內糯米除外）一段取消。　　　附表第二中搬入向上海地區者」中，將「米二公斤」一段取消，民國三十三年五月二十五日中國派遣軍總可令官，中國方面艦隊可令長官，大日本帝國特命令　大使　　日大使館當局談　　為緩和現行物資搬運限制，於合理統制下謀物資圓滑流通起見，中國政府及日本當局，早即抱有同一之方針。此次中日兩富局協議結果，於上海週邊收締搬運規則中，將米除外，使於上海市政府及米統會之合理管制下，對搬入上海之米糧，得暢行無一阻。此對民生安定上，發生極大之效果，自不待言。然如有不法商人，籍此次搬運規則之修正，投機囤積，或違反中國方面主管富局與米統會之統制，致引起米價昻騰者，此於中國當局方面，巳訂有斷然處治之辦法，宙屬當然。即日本方面關係當局，對此亦採有同一方針，對日本之僑商違反者，自將予嚴重取罰。即對中國方面之取締，亦將加以適當之協力。總之無論中日國籍之米糧業者，皆應體念此次撤消統制之眞意及當局與食安定之偉業是為至盼。</p>

<h3>日大本營發表　河南日軍戰果　洛陽渝軍被日監視中</h3>
<p>東京廿四日中央社電日大本營廿四日下午四時三十分發表：　河南方而日軍與新由山西方面南下之日軍有力部　隊相呼應，擊潰渝第一戰區軍主力，刻正繼續作戰中。　洛陽刻正由日軍之一部監視中，該地周圍孤立之渝軍，約有三師左右。　作戰開始以來，至五月廿一日，判明主要戰果如次：收容渝軍遺體三萬四千人百具，俘虜九千四百人，擊落飛機十八架，（內三架不確實），鹵獲大砲二百另六門，輕重　關槍七百二十五挺，步槍約一千枝，汽車百另八輛，車頭大輛，鐵路貨車百二十三輛，日軍損失為戰死八百八十名。</p>
<p>鄭州二十四日中央社電蔣鼎文指揮下之渝軍十餘師，及由第八戰區來援之胡宗南軍數師，共約二十萬人，前曾在洛陽西方，及黃河南方之新安宜陽一帶，力謀反攻。因日軍之猛烈進擊，刻正謀向西南方面逃遁，因此該地日軍除以一部監視洛陽之渝軍外，並以戰車為主幹之有力部隊，國殲該方面渝軍主力。乃於十二日在空軍協同之下，展開大規模之攻防戰，日軍先鋒已使湯恩伯指揮下之第十二軍，在洛陽附近潰亂後，澈底蹂躪嵩縣。另一路日軍則沿洛河西進，於十六日壓制位於洛陽西方洛河河谷之長水鎮，猛攻駐屯洛甯之第九十六軍第十七師，擬予以澈底殲減。則於十入日突入洛甯，遮斷隴海綫，並與日軍各部隊呼應，形成連絡新安觀音堂洛甯之三角形包圍陣，並追擊洛陽平原敗退而來之渝軍約五師，計三萬五千人，將之完全殲減。在此短期間內，第一戰區蔣鼎文指揮下之六軍十三師，及湯恩伯軍及第八戰區胡宗南軍等約二十師，計二十萬人，或　滅，或潰亂，由於湯恩俏軍失去主力，蔣鼎文軍之被　　，第一戰區此已遭動搖</p>

<h3>鏡頭中所見的「海軍魂」每日新聞社攝影記者的對談</h3>
<p>日本每日新聞社特派攝影記者新見達郞，山本金治兩名從軍南方戰棧，歷時約一年，出人槍林彈雨間，攝得照片極多。日本海軍在前棧耐苦奮戰情形，二君耳聞目覩，所知綦詳，以下為兩君的對談。　　攝影的困難</p>
<p>新見：那裹所聞見的一切，都是惑人肺腑的海軍精神之縮圖。攝進照相機的，都長非常珍貴的。山本：在密林內實不能攝影，即在白天也很黑暗。新幾丙亞的密林，實是原始楱莽未關的森林。直徑六尺左右的大樹，無枝無解的高　天空，約有一百五十尺高。樹頂則枝　繁茂如傘，遮蔽者日光。在這種森林中奮鬥的勇士們之崇高的姿態，現在都一一攝入鏡頭，傳達到後方來。　　新見：如　　細雨般充滿在密林內的濕氣，是攝影機的敵八。軟片的感光膜，因高熱與濕氣而即熔散。然而我們把一捲一捲軟片裝入特製的罐中，用膠布封起來，祗有十捲另用乾燥　裝入這特製的罐中保存着。軟片一裝入攝影機，過了二三天不攝，就沒有用了。　　密林的兵隊</p>
<p>山本：海岸綫大體是椰子林的乾地燥帶，適於居住，但這裏成為敵機的轟炸目標，所以部隊不能不設營於密林內土著民都不能居位的地方。兵士們在搭在木樁上的粗陋小屋中生活着。地面都日是泥沼，所以搭起椰子樹的木樁來走到鄰屋。因　　與乾燥，洗　的東西經了三天還不會乾，而乾的地方，一面卻發尋生了白毛，白襯衫洗　了之後反變成黑襯衫。一起黑姻，宿　地就要被敵機發見，所以勇士們連捲姻的姻都加以注意。炊食都在離開一·二公里的地方舉火。敵機來製最激烈的時候，在黑夜中把火遮蔽了舉炊。水是極難得的，要洗淨的時候，也只能把臭泥沼中土色的水煮沸了應用。飲水是用蒸留法取用的。</p>
<p>新見：那裹有熱帶瘧疾，熱帶潰瘍等惡疾。這是○○島的一段故事；從前綫歸來的一個兵士，不蝦休息，從衣袋中拿出一柄　紙刀，跑出宿舍，附近一塊樹葉的隙縫太陽光射下米的地方，那兵士在那裏把一張紙攤在手上。問他「做甚麼」，說是在晒乾它。「那紙片是什麼呢？」「是信，是我孩子半年前寄來的信·」被汗與泥染污了的紙上，寫着幼稚的假各文字·這半年以來，這兵士一直穿着溫襯衫，沒有找到有陽光的地方晒乾，以致這封信也不能看淸楚。這種情景，實使人感動，然而這是不能用照相表現出來的姿熊。　　密林戰</p>
<p>新見：因視綫狹隘，密林戰完全同夜戰一樣。隨時有與敵交戰的可能。戰士們躡手躡足，屛息靜氣，鐵帽上裝飾着雜草，踏者泥滬沼前進。突堅前裂毗前進，臉上淌着黃豆大的汗珠。衣服被荊棘牽　着，軍靴踏入泥濘。鎗劍不時被樹頂透下來的一線仰光照耀者閃閃發光。那真是莊嚴的戰士之　。攝影時這實是最好的毫無偽裝的資料。</p>
<p>山木：聲音對神經實在很有影響。密林內寂靜如死，但不時有風吹動枝葉而呼呼作聲。約有二十頭野猪集團行動時喀殺喀殺的聲音，與沒有風而突然倒下的樹木的聲音，不時雜然並作。兵士們最怕的是這樹木因腐敗而自然倒下的情形。這真是風聲實例，是南部新幾尼亞密林戰的故事。第一線的兵士被樹木所絆而　　跌倒了。附近的鸚鵡被那聲音驚飛起來。那裹雪白的鸚鵡很多，一　呀呀地呌着。這時候幾十頭鸚鵡的呌聲，使戰士們一夜緊張　來，以為被敵人發見了，準備肉搏敵陣。然而一到敵陣看時，機鎗，步鎗，食繼，彈藥，散亂滿地。戰士們哈哈大笑。鸚鵡的呌聲使敵人驚慌失措而逃走了。散亂的武器彈藥，表示他們的慌張。　　海戰</p>
<p>新見：從倍拉拉倍拉島轉進作數的時候，與敵巡洋襤三艘，　逐艦四艘，魚雷艇多艘遭遇而展開激烈的夜戰。我正乘在旗艦上，立即拿起照相機到甲板上預備攝取海戰的鏡頭，但在夜間終不能攝影。敵人從一萬六千米的遠距離發射着色彈。這着色彈有似二個血紅的炭相並者飛過來。軍艦上全部燈火管制，戰士們的活躍情形亦不能攝取，拿着熊相機無事可做，和軍醫長，主計長一同當瞭望員。軍　長突然呌起來：「○○號被幹了。」○○號是我們的驅逐艦。看時，前部砲塔附近被血紅的火包團着。黑夜中淸晣可見。我不禁咬着牙。敵彈似乎以這火為目標而集中射擊。捲起了無數的水柱。不多時，砲塔的火熄減了，後部甲板又起火，軍艦從妝部開始下沈。火勢猛烈，包圍全艦，砲塔二度起火。啊！沈下去了。正在前部砲塔亦幾全部沒入水中的時候，轟然一聲爆火的聲音。沈沒的大砲，尙向着敵艦放出最後的一彈。一半沈在海中的砲，還在發射，世界海戰史上有這種可怕的事嗎？祗有我海軍。我到現在還不能忘記那最後的炮聲，這海戰中，獲得擊　巡洋軍艦一艘　遂艦三艘的大戰果，我方亦喪失驅逐艦一艘。　　孤島的瞭望員</p>
<p>山本：新幾內亞南部的阿第島有一瞭望所。此地適富敵機從澳洲製擊新幾內亞的航路，故不分畫夜的隙望者有無敵機敵潛水艦的發現。那是一個荒島，每三個月運一次食糧到這裹來，那是隔絕人世的生活。我曾一度乘那聯絡船到該島。暸望員望見船形，就在海岸揮着毛巾襯衫。船近岸，沙沙地跑到海灘，向每一兵士問：「你帶了些什麼來？有鄉間來的信嗎」一見這漆黑而精神充沛的兵士，不由得不使人感動。全島是密林，爬上海岸邊高一百五十尺的椰子樹從事暸望。除三月來一次的逼艘聯絡船之外，這島上別無安慰這些勇士們的事物。有時。五尺大的海龜，為了產卵而到沙灘上來，這是唯一的稀客。這裏是常常地震的地方，有一天逼島上因地震而起了大變化。那島因地震而沈下去了。沙灘，丘陵眼看着漸漸地向海中沈下去。暸望員用無綫電向基地報告：「阿茅島目前因地震而下沈中，然而祇要有一片木塊，還是繼續瞭望。可是基地沒有船可以差遣救助。那悲壯的無綫電不斷的打來，基地上的人祗有向天祈　。幸而那陸沈不久也就停止，全島平安無事，現在成鴛一件笑話。假使眞的完全陸沈下去，又將如何呢？這島上的暸望員，將盡者人所不知的任務，而殉職罷！　　新見：新愛爾蘭最南端的○○　，亦有這樣的瞭望所。那是敵機從所羅門空襲拉巴爾的必徑之路。拉巴爾靠着這瞭望員的報告，可以早二十分鐘知道敵機前來空襲。瞭望的所在，是斷崖絕壁上所挖的洞窟。聯絡船也不過半年來往一次。與四脚蛇及海龜為伴，不分畫夜的警戒着，其勞苦實非言語所能形容。且如欲拍電報告有別法。這種瞭望所，南海各地很多，佈置下有力的哨戒網，也有許多瞭望所，派發了「敵○○名來擊，目前正應戰中」的無綫電，而最後玉碎的也很多。我們應以這前綫勇士的精神為精神，後方與前綫同其勞苦。（翔：譯自五月十三日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>市公用局　擬訂節電方案　生產消費者合理分配</h3>
<p>本市近又實行第二次普遍節電，各界於協力實行之餘，咸盼當局對現行制度，加以調整，務期節電與增產，兼尋並顧，使產業界不致陷於麻痺狀態，日昨記者特就此項問題，叩詢葉公用局長，當承發表談話如后：「節約電力原爲節約物資之一環，實爲戰時應有之措置，第如何始克臻於合理化，則則則爲一極端複雜而亟待解决之問題。半年以前，所行之辦法，係爲普遍折減制，此次再度節減，其辦法亦仍舊貫，手續雖屬簡便，而於事實上則未盡合理，以致平日浪費成習者，未必澈底節省，而實際需耍者，則已深覺其苦，至一般因電力減少，影響生產，尤爲經濟上嚴重問題。際茲决戰階段，增加生產，實爲刻不容緩之要圖，如因節電而減低生產能力，實屬得不償失，本局職掌全市公用事業，對此問題，深爲重視，刻已從詳計劃，務期生產所需，得以維持適量之供給，而奢侈消費，則嚴加限制，對於居戶日常用電，亦將按其實際需要，予以公平分配云。」聞此項計劃，一俟與有關機關商洽後，即可付諸實施。</p>

<h3>日陸軍發言人　談河南戰況　洛陽陷落迫在眉睫</h3>
<p>盟邦日本上海陸軍報道部發言人，於昨（二十四）日午後二時循例會見本市中國新聞記者團時，對此次河南作戰，渝方蒙受損害，及劉政治經濟之影響，闡述綦詳。茲誌其談話如次：一關於此次河南作戰之詳細經過情形，因日大本營當局尚未發表，故未便先行公布，惟目前最大問題，厥爲洛陽之陷落，在洛陽未陷落前，吾人尚不能談及得到最終結束，但迄今重要城市被日軍佔領者，爲數甚多，而日軍之最終目標，當爲洛陽，現日軍集結全力，即在攻陷洛陽，戰　雖告激烈，然日軍之進展則意外神速。吾人總觀在此次作戰中，渝軍之被日軍殲滅者，計共有六個軍二十師，以兵士人數言，約計十八萬人·故今洛陽雖尚未陷落，但已迪在眉睫，故第一期目標，可說已告完成，而日軍毀滅淪方兵力，亦已達預期目標，渝方之湯恩伯蔣鼎文部隊，已遭致命打擊。</p>
<p>精稅部隊大受打擊</p>
<p>吾人更可注意者，湯恩伯蔣鼎文號稱渝方之最精銳部隊，今已受最慘大之打擊，業已無法再行恢復其實力，再觀淪方軍隊之指揮混亂情形，更不一而足，試舉一例以言之，當作戰最激烈之際，渝方軍事當局曾　令湯恩伯堅守登嚴密縣兩點，然此時湯之部隊早已聞風而逸，可見部下已無戰意，而更可讀者，湯竟不知部下已在何處，其混亂狀態，竟至如是地步，誠堪發　。而洛陽之迄今未見陷落，因日軍現正逐漸縮小包團國，正四面分兵一待完全包圍時，即可一鼓而下，將其攻陷。再日軍不但在隴海綫佔有絕對優勢，即渝方亦自認日軍在相近陝西　氏地方，亦已發動攻勢，現洛陽已被日軍重兵包圍，故該城不啻已成甕中之　。洛陽內渝軍現約存三師，日方目的須將該項兵力加以殲滅，不使稍存，而後佔領該城，如此可達到殲減敵軍之主力，再佔城市，眞所謂一舉兩得，故日軍之進攻洛陽，不操之過急，即因此故也。且其他戰綫之發動攻勢，決不因洛陽之未告陷落，而受有影響。</p>
<p>怒江戰事虛張聲勢</p>
<p>再述此次河南作戰，第一期已告完成，現已在第二期作戰中，而渝方因在此次作戰中完全失敗，故不得不設法製造各種論調，在怒江一帶發動攻勢，宣傳奪回密芝拿。吾人從軍事上加以批評之，此全屬宣傳策略而已，若說其「死要面子」亦無不可。吾人即試就怒江渡河作戰一點，加以分析如下：渝方對怒江渡河作戰近雖宣傳甚烈，但並無任何動作，怒江一帶渝方衛立煌部下僅有數師之軍力，正企圖作渡江蠢動，幾師之眾，兵力已見極小，其事實上能渡江者，更見少數，彼等企岡到達騰越龍體蠶動，然迄今所得者僅爲若干橋頭堡，而企圖再將大軍源源運來，但現已爲日有力部隊加以包圍，不久即可殲滅，故渝方軍事發言人，亦承認怒江戰事因天雨而陷于停頓狀態中。渝方對此方戰事雖極爲重視，但其實力渺小，次不能如願以償，是可斷言。再就密芝拿方面，淪方亦極力宣傳佔領鐵路綫，但彼等無論如何鼓吹，吾人一觀日軍之堅强實力，即可得知渝方所宜傳者，全屬子虛，尤其給養方面，更感束手無策，渝方雖盛傳空中補充給養，事實上全是夢想，此點渝方軍事發言人亦已承認，會則渝方所以如此極力宣傳者，乃所河南作戰慘敗，以圖掩飾而已。</p>
<p>河南作戰渝方影響</p>
<p>茲我人再就此次河南作戰給與重慶之影響，約略說明如下：</p>
<p>（一）渝方最精銳之湯恩伯軍，旣遭全部殲減，使美國對渝方之信仰發生懷疑。（二）英美之與論中心，均關心于渝方今後能否獨力繼續作戰，而英美之所以關心此點者，乃在欲利用重慶力量，消耗日方之戰力，欲在中國大陸作對日作戰之根據地，此即英美之陰險手叚。但此次渝方之最精銳湯恩伯軍，旣如此慘敗，無怪英美懷疑渝方是否再能單獨繼續作戰，而淪方之勝利公債，亦因此次河南作戰失敗，在倫敦市面上價値暴跌，由此更可觀測重慶在國際地位之低落，英美方面更謂此次河南作戰渝方慘敗之兩大原因：（一）淪共之對立，（二）重慶內部意見參差不齊，尤其英美方面對蔣之獨裁政治，更爲不滿，因此英美進一步千涉渝方之內政，尤其美國在渝之空軍根據地，相繼被日軍粉碎，痛心之餘，遷怒淪方，不能代爲防護其根據地。再就渝共關係調整問題，中共代表林祖涵與渝方代表王世杰張治中幾度非正式會議，但此種會議，可說全在英美壓力下舉行，事實上會議亦決無結果，談不到合作，徒增渝方麻煩，英美之所以希望渝共舉行會議，係企求彼等相安無事，充分爲英美所利用，故英美之目的，决不在解放及復興中國，僅欲持之爲戰勝之工具，使中華民族永無得見天地之一日。</p>
<h3>物價對策委會　籌備就緒</h3>
<p>實業部當局爲强化物價管理，近曾會同　市政府，及中日有關機關，在滬　組物價對策委員會，以期對物價謀得合理解決。茲愁該會緊經實業部及市府等有關方面，積極籌備·業已大體就緒·至主任委員一職，聞將由吳頌皐氏兼任，至今後之主要工作，則以上海地方物價爲中心，取得嚴密管理，以期適應戰時經濟體制，而使各地物價平衡，民生安定，决不使再有暴漲之崎形現象。</p>
<h3>郵政員工怠工　正勸導復工</h3>
<p>郵政當局前以員工待過低微，郵政經濟虧損甚巨，乃呈奉政府核准自本月十六日起，增加郵資百分之二百，此次加價後，首即提高員工待遇，於本月份起加發薪津一倍，當局對於改善員工生活，已盡其最大努力，而員工方面，以要求金行米貼制度，突於廿二日起怠工，事前並未派代表與當局接洽，赤未經工會同意。自發生怠工後，郵政常局即積極開導，郵務工會亦竭力勸導奔走交涉，但郵政當局以無能爲力，拒絕任何條件，昨（廿四）日郵政當局暨上海郵務工會曾分別發表談話及緊急通告，勸導迅速復工，以維郵運，而謀公衆之便利。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>節電原則</h3>
<p>本市公用局葉局長談話（見今日本報），對於本市實行第二次節約電力辦法，應區別生產與消費者間的合理分配，我們認爲道是很重要的問題。半年以前所定的節電辦法，係普遍折減制，其結果，消費者平日浪費成習，未必澈底節有，而生產者實際需要，則深覺其苦。這次節電辦法，仍屬普遍折減，則其結果，對於生產者，因節電而減低生產能力，確屬得不償失。所以，因節電而減低生產，决不是節電的原意，更不是增產聲中應有的現象。</p>
<p>我們竭力主張節約電力，應絕對限制奢侈消費，如娛樂塲所提早結束，酒菜館縮短晚間營業時間，旅館居家禁止通宵打牌，停止家用電氣冰箱電風扇等等，電力公司對於奢侈消費者電力供給減至最小限度。另方面對於正當生產事業，社會公益事業的電力供給，不但不應與奢侈消費者比例普遍減少，應從嚴格考核其實際需要，而作適當的保持或增加，傳維持其生產能力，維持其服務效率。</p>
<p>値得重復提出的：節約電力的原則，應區別消費者與生產者間的合理分配。</p>

<h3>解決當前物價問題</h3>
<p>— 仁明</p>
<p>本月二十一日，新聞報經濟社論欄內，載有「論物價的述鎖性」一文，對於當局現在採取之低物價政策，認爲由於全面統制之未能澈底，統制機構之不究備，與人事之不健全，低物價政策，非但未能達到預期之效果，且使生產停頓，物資缺乏，物價呈週期性之梯形上漲，民生疾苦，有增無減。最後引證日文大陸新報所提，「在可能範圍內盡力恢復物價的自然形態」一點，向社會有識人士建議考慮放棄統制物價政策。此一論文，對於當前物價政策之失敗，申論極有理由，但對於放棄物便政策以筱當局所應採取之方針與步驟，並未指出，筆者不敏，爰就管見所及，略貢　獎，藉資補充</p>
<p>就經濟學原理而論，統制物價一事，本爲治標之圖，當戰事發動之初，物資供應問題尚未達嚴重階段，其時採取統制物價方針，無可非議，徒以種種關係，此一政策，宣告失敗，殆無疑義。目前物資供應，日益短絀，而增加生產，似乎驟難實現，制物價。改爲漢澈底統制物資。過去物價節節上升，其原因雖極複雜，但市儈奸商，囤積物資，操縱居奇，轉輾買賣，使物價無形抬高，實爲最大因素。居奇囤積，一日不消滅，則物價水無抑平之望。欲圖消減此類行爲，非着手統制物資不為功，統制物資之方式，可由統制經濟機關實施管理各業商人之賣買，規定商人在成交賣買以前，須先經由同業公會證明，向主管經濟機關申請，由該機關審核其賽買性質，是否正當，成交價格，是否合理。倘買賣兩方均屬業中人，而賣方索價合理，買方之需用數量，並不過份（譬如製造商採購原料不超過三個月之用量）則不妨予以核准，反之如資買雙方，均為業外人，則其營業顯屬遠法，將不予核准。</p>
<p>至於統制商業買賣之方式，第一步可先從登記着手，通令各業商人將有貨報請登記，俾當局可以明瞭物資存底情形，便於調整。第二步實施限制物資移動辦法，規定物資搬運，須先向主管機講請領許可證，方得　辦，凡屬不正當之買賣，一槪禁止將物資移動。換言之，即一切物資，非經領有許可證，不准移動。</p>
<p>上述統制物資之計劃，果能付諸實施，並輔以健全之執行機構與人事組織，則所收效果，不雖達到下列各端：（一）可以杜絕囤積居奇，消滅黑市轉輾交易。可以糾正售價，使物價不平而自平。（三）可以酌　盈虛，配給原料，並防止以主要原料，移用於次要方面。（四）可以改善日用品配給制度，並設法增加配給物品種數。（五）可以加强同業公會之組織。</p>
<p>如謂物資名目繁多，不易實施全面統制者，不妨先從統制各項日　必需品入手，然後逐步推及其他物品，抑平物價，改善民生，實深利賴，尚望社會明達入士與有關係當局，亟起　之！</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>給妹妹的信（四）</p>
<p>對於煩燥的隆夫心情，住在這樣荒凉而古老的久里濱館的二樓，或許甚為合適也未可知。</p>
<p>地在褪了色而高低不平的席十上，睡了一個整天。從開着的窗戶裏望到的秋季天空，由碧藍色變成淺黃色了。此時電燈開了，不知不覺地太陽落了。</p>
<p>因爲沒有客人，就不燒澡塘，老板娘說附近有澡塘，然而他心中非常的不靜，所以沒有情緒去洗澡。</p>
<p>「客人先生，您只是睡覺麼？」</p>
<p>老板娘把晚飯端了來。菜中有　魚，章魚，新鮮的當地魚等，　　着很多，然而隆夫却無意去吃。嘮嘮叨叨的老板娘，無論說了多少話，而隆夫只是默默無言，所以老板娘覺着無辦法，而就把被褥打開，走下樓去了</p>
<p>尚未到七號鐘，但隆夫就息了燈睡花床上了。話雖這樣說，但入睡也不是容易事。來回走道的木屐聲，以及什麽地方傳來的無綫電聲，眞令</p>
<p>不久後，木屐和無綫電的聲音靜下去了，然而出乎意外，波浪的聲音非常淸晰地傳到枕邊來。他的眼睛，愈發嶝的大了。</p>
<p>白天看到的艦影，總是在他的眼前浮現着，無論怎樣都拂不去。戴着眼鏡的軍需少尉，向隆夫顯着威風，而微笑着。假如自己的體格是健康的話，明年也就會穿着那位士官的軍服。</p>
<p>（現在還想這樣事，有什麼用？）</p>
<p>他反轉了一下身體。同特眼框中滿盛着的淚珠，一滑流到了枕頭上。</p>
<p>（並不，只是沒當上海軍士官。也沒當上書家。）</p>
<p>他到這樣地方來，不得不靜養的理由，終於想到了。</p>
<p>（一切都完了。無論那一條道，都失敗了。現在無論怎樣再振作精神，也不行了。）</p>
<p>眞是山窮水盡的情緒。那未就跑回父母的膝下，告饒自己的不孝，忍受鄉人的　笑，或許在家鄕的官廳裏作個小差使。</p>
<p>他認爲業已到了給枝妹寫信的時機了。</p>
<p>突然隆夫跳起來，開了電燈。從皮包中拿出自來水筆和信紙來，跑到　骯的飯桌前而去了。</p>
<p>—枝妹，我……</p>
<p>開頭的幾句尚未寫完的時候，隆夫覺得千愁萬緒，都迫於眼前，於是使抱頭大哭了。（九）（十）（三）</p>

        <h1>1944.05.25</h1>
<h3>Strengthening Personnel</h3>
<p>In order to enhance wartime administrative efficiency, the government recently announced a plan to reform provincial administrative organs, close down the Shanghai offices of various ministries, and merge the food bureaus of various special municipalities into the economic bureaus. At the same time, it is heard that the government will, on the one hand, eliminate redundant and idle civil servants from its affiliated agencies and, on the other hand, increase their salaries. From the point of view of enhancing wartime administrative efficiency, this is indeed a wise and appropriate measure. In the midst of rising prices, simplifying administration on the one hand and improving the treatment of civil servants on the other are indeed beneficial to the reform of politics.</p>
<p>Although poor political systems and duplicate administrative organs are all causes that prevent politics from getting on the right track, the main cause is still "unsound personnel." Therefore, even with excellent systems and rigorous institutions, if there are no sound personnel to promote and implement them, the results will still be in vain. All systems are originally dead, and all institutions are originally empty. For example, the theories and systems of controlled economy are all very correct. Especially in wartime, controlled economy is even more important. It goes without saying that countries such as China, Japan, and Germany have adopted it, but even countries such as Britain and the United States, which have always been liberal economies, have had to adopt controlled policies. However, once the theories and systems of controlled economy are implemented in China, the situation is completely different. Some corrupt officials regard controlled economy as an opportunity to seize real economic power and consider it a shortcut to wealth, so that some people who manage control have filled their pockets in a short period of time, while those who are controlled are increasingly oppressed and complain. However, the original purpose of the controlled economy was to evenly distribute essential goods and stabilize the lives of the people in wartime, but now the facts are completely contrary to the purpose, with disadvantages but no advantages. May I ask: Why can controlled economy work in Germany? Why can the rationing system be done well in Japan? And why is it counterproductive in China? This is not because the theory of controlled economy is wrong, nor is it because the rationing system itself is bad. The crux of the problem lies in unsound personnel. This is the case with controlled economy, and the same is true with other political issues.</p>
<p>A recent editorial in the *Continental News* discussed the National Government's efforts to reform officialdom and was quite incisive. It said: "First, implement the simplification of administrative organs, reduce redundant personnel, and on the other hand, improve the treatment of capable civil servants, then it will not be difficult to restore their vigorous spirit of doing things. But it is a big mistake to hope that simply improving treatment will automatically reform officialdom. Improving treatment, although a condition and prerequisite for improving administrative efficiency, cannot be entirely relied upon. On the one hand, we must pursue the responsibilities of officials, implement the policy of clear rewards and punishments, and then the reform of officialdom can be fully realized. It can be said that now is an excellent time to establish this atmosphere." This is exactly the same as what we have always advocated.</p>
<p>We have always believed that "strengthening personnel" is a prerequisite for reforming the new officialdom and improving administrative efficiency, and improving treatment is only one point in strengthening personnel. Secondly, adopting talent-based principles, pursuing the responsibilities of officials, and implementing the policy of certain punishment are all extremely important items that must be completely reversed. We hope that the government will pay attention to the comprehensive methods of strengthening personnel when it seeks to enhance wartime administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Editorial Commentary</p>
<h3>The National Government Refreshes Officialdom</h3>
<p>The National Government is studying specific plans based on the original proposal of the Ministry of Finance to improve the treatment of officials, and is considering a system of providing salaries in kind such as rice and grain. There is no better way to maintain the value of the reserve coupons, and in the current situation of endless price increases, price salaries can be said to be the most practical method. However, it is very difficult to implement, and the authorities should carefully study and fully prepare. In short, the National Government is merging central government offices, abolishing Shanghai offices, simplifying provincial administrative organs, and starting to reorganize the central and local administrations; at the same time, it is also improving the treatment of school teachers and staff and stabilizing the lives of civil servants. This is a welcome phenomenon. Without guaranteeing the lives of civil servants, there is no talk of clean politics or responsible politics.</p>
<p>We take this opportunity to sincerely hope that the National Government will more thoroughly simplify the administrative organs and increase administrative efficiency. Whether in the central or local government, there are still quite a few government offices, institutions, and offices that have a sign but no actual activity. The era of using complete institutions to show the majesty of the central government has passed. Now is the time to earnestly request that the actual situation in China be taken into account and that simple and efficient administrative operations be implemented. We must eliminate favoritism and reorganize with the administrative organs of the National Government as the center. At the same time, we cannot adopt slightly bold and effective methods in the execution of affairs. Is it not a tendency to waste energy to spend days in paperwork with so-called red tape, and to draft and exchange formal documents? The simplification of administrative organs must be accompanied by increased administrative efficiency to be meaningful. The National Government seems to need to think deeply about this point as well.</p>
<p>In short, it is most urgent at present to invigorate an atmosphere of active activity among officials and to instill a strong sense of responsibility. It is unreasonable to treat civil servants with such poor conditions and demand activity and responsibility from them as before. First, implement the simplification of administrative organs, reduce redundant personnel, and on the other hand, improve the treatment of capable civil servants, then it will not be difficult to restore their vigorous spirit of doing things. But it is a big mistake to hope that simply improving treatment will automatically reform officialdom. Improving treatment, although a condition and prerequisite for improving administrative efficiency, cannot be entirely relied upon. On the one hand, we must pursue the responsibilities of officials, implement the policy of clear rewards and punishments, and then the reform of officialdom can be fully realized. It can be said that now is an excellent time to establish this atmosphere. We sincerely hope that the National Government authorities will work hard to comfort the people's hopes.

<h3>Fierce Fighting Around Kohima Japanese Army Repels Enemy Counterattack General Nakamura Comments on the Indian Ocean War Situation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 24th The enemy troops in Ukhrul were attacked by the Japanese army and were eager to open the last blood path. Since the 16th, the enemy has fiercely attacked the Kanglatongbi on the Kohima Highway and the eastern highlands. There were two attacks on the 16th, three on the 17th, and five on the 15th. The Japanese troops in the area fought against the many with the few, day and night, and launched continuous counterattacks, inflicting great damage on the enemy. The enemy finally collapsed and retreated. On the morning of the 19th, five enemy tanks were destroyed in the northern highlands of Kanglatongbi, and ten other tanks and many heavy mortars were also destroyed. The enemy's counterattack attempts were all crushed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 24th The British army is trying to actively break through Dimapur in order to rescue the Fourth Army besieged in the Imphal Basin. The Kohima-Imphal Highway has recently been reinforced in the Dimapur area. At the same time, mechanized units such as tanks, aircraft, and artillery continue to counterattack the Japanese army's positions around Kohima, especially the counterattack against the 5102 highland is the most intense. At dawn on the 19th, the enemy army launched harassing artillery from the Chotsoma Manzbuza area, and counterattacked with 19 tanks as a vanguard, but was eventually repelled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's first-line artillery even destroyed five of its tanks. On the evening of the same day, the enemy army attacked the northwest of the highland with one heavy tank and four field guns. The Japanese army immediately fired fiercely, and the heavy tank was hit and caught fire, so the enemy's counterattack attempt was shattered. In addition, the enemy army transported tanks and artillery units by air to reinforce the 1630 highland southwest of Kohima, Narhema, and Longuzumi, in order to capture Kohima. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in various places, but the enemy has been frustrated due to the fierce attack of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th When Japanese Navy General Chosaburo Nakamura met with reporters, he talked about Mountbatten's Indian Ocean operations and said that after the rainy season, the operations in India and Burma will shift from land to sea. The main points of his discussion are as follows: In addition to the Pacific operations, the United States also hopes to open the Chongqing highway through India. At the same time, it also attempts to launch mobile units to form a central offensive route through the Philippines to the Chinese mainland. Britain had programmed the Southeast Pacific Army under Mountbatten several months ago, but to this day, what it has implemented is only small-scale vanguard battles. However, if the land battle turns into a stalemate during the rainy season, the activities of the naval forces will be more active. Although the strength of the enemy fleet in India is not known in detail, it is said to be a fleet based on three or four battleships. In the future, some may be transferred from the Mediterranean. It is difficult to operate with such a small fleet. Mountbatten cannot issue orders to operate. Although the United States has repeatedly requested it, its future activities will still be difficult to exceed small-scale actions such as air raids on Surabaya. The activities of Mountbatten's army are closely related to the formation of the European Second Front. He cannot ignore the Second Front. The opening and closing of the European Second Front must not be interrupted. At that time, most of the British forces will be devoted to this battle. From the point of view of British selfishness, the naval operations in East Asia will be entirely entrusted to the United States. If the Second Front is postponed again, Mountbatten's army may start a sensation within the scope of its strength. In short, the strength of the British Navy in the Indian Ocean is not very sound, and the enemy's sensation is not worth worrying about. This is the same as the enemy's operations in the Aleutian Islands in the north. It is difficult to achieve more than a diversionary effect, so the Japanese army is not worried under its strong defense.</p>
<h3>Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Gives Preferential Treatment to International Students</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The Greater East Asia Ministry has decided to increase the supply of fats and other side dishes to international students from various countries in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere from the beginning of May, in addition to the prescribed food and vegetables, and adapt to the habits of each country. Aoki, Minister of the Greater East Asia, visited the International Student Friendship Association (South), the Japan-China Society (China), the Zenrin Society (Mongolia), and the Japan-Thailand College (Thailand, India, etc.) on the 17th and 18th to guide the organs and inspect the lives of international students. At the same time, he summoned the international students of the three groups to give lectures, the general idea being: It is hoped that the students will study their studies on the one hand, and on the other hand, they must recognize the true rule of Japan, so that Japan and the countries of Greater East Asia can cooperate closely. Although there are various inconveniences due to material relations, Japan will overcome these difficulties. Japan has gone through hardships to liberate East Asia, and you must deeply recognize its spirit.</p>
<h3>Japanese Undersea Tunnel Double-Track Construction Project Decided to be Completed Ahead of Schedule</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The double-track work of the undersea railway tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji in Japan was rapidly carried out with the goal of opening on October 1st. However, due to the urgent request for the transportation of important materials, it has now been decided to open it ahead of schedule. The work is currently being stepped up. The new line penetration work in the laying of the track is scheduled to be completed in mid-August, and operations will begin immediately. At the same time, other works on the existing tunnel track will be completed within one month, so the long-awaited double-track opening line will start operating on September 25. Efforts are now being made to speed up the work.</p>
<h3>Thailand's New Capital Under Active Construction Agricultural Products are Also Striving to Increase Production</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Bangkok, 24th The groundbreaking ceremony of Thailand's new capital, Phetchabun, was held solemnly at the end of last month in the presence of Prime Minister Pipon and his wife. Phetchabun is about 300 kilometers north of Bangkok, slightly in the central part of Thailand, surrounded by mountains on the east, west, and north sides. It is a basin that is 100 kilometers long from north to south and 30 kilometers long from east to west. The new capital of Thailand is being built in a scattered manner in this area. According to the old</p>
<p>Phetchabun</p>
<p>It was only a small mountain village, but after being laid as the new capital, residents from all over the world have successively moved in. Now the number of residents has reached 50,000. A highway with a width of 7 meters has been completed, starting from the Sabangbin Station of the Bangkok-Chiang Mai Railway. In addition, highways are also being built in various places. According to the Phetchabun City authorities, in order to prepare for future population growth, they are working hard to increase agricultural production. The soil is quite suitable for growing sugarcane, rice, corn, and cultivating tobacco fruits. In addition, the construction of factories such as electric lights, tap water, and ice making is also gradually becoming concrete, and a weekly newspaper has been published since April 3. It is said that all political, military, and economic organs concentrated in Bangkok will be moved to Phetchabun. Although it is impossible in fact, the Thai government is very enthusiastic about the construction of the new capital, and its future development is really worth looking forward to.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce Establishes Food Production Increase Department Gathering Government and Civilian Forces to Thoroughly Achieve the Goal</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has decided to establish a wartime food production increase headquarters in the province and local government offices in order to gather the total power of the government and civilians to thoroughly achieve the goal of increasing food production. Regarding this matter, at the cabinet meeting on the 23rd, Agriculture and Commerce Minister Uchida reported as follows: The increase headquarters will be set up in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, and the local headquarters will be set up in the local government offices. The Minister of Agriculture and Commerce will serve as the Minister of the Central Headquarters, and the local governors will serve as the Minister of the Local Headquarters. The main task of the Central Headquarters is to seek the flexibility of technical guidance and the implementation of Li Li's mobilization plan. At the same time, it will unite with the Agricultural Patriotic Alliance to carry out joint activities, and the Agricultural Patriotic Team will also be placed under the command of the Minister to tighten the work. On the one hand, in order to consult with the relevant authorities of other ministries to promote countermeasures, a wartime food conference will be set up in the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce to review and deal with the necessary materials and distribution consumption relations for increasing production. In response to the establishment of the Wartime Food Production Increase Headquarters, the Eastern Province has organized a Food Production Student Commando, mobilizing students from five agricultural science universities and fourteen specialized schools to various farms as cadres of the Food Production Increase Team to carry out the work of increasing production and serving the country.</p>
<h3>Talking About the Central Plains War Situation</h3>
<p>— Bi Guang</p>
<p>A: The recent Henan war has attracted attention. Please tell us about the overall situation of the war.</p>
<p>B: This time, the Chongqing side has also admitted that the Henan war has suffered a major blow. From the perspective of the war situation, the most important thing is the opening and control of the entire Jinghan Line. The Japanese North China and Central China Army troops met on the 9th of this month at Queshan, a major station on the Jinghan Line. Since the North China Japanese Army started its operations, it has only been 20 days, and it has successively captured important cities such as Xiangzhou and Xuchang. The Central China Japanese Army responded to the Northern Army from Xinyang and marched north, completing the combat goal of opening the Jinghan Road in just one week. After the meeting of the Central China and North China Japanese armies, the war situation extended westward, and the Japanese army has already broken into Luoyang, and some have even passed Tongguan. The initiative in the Central Plains War has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>A: The biggest achievement of the Japanese army in this operation seems to be the impact on international politics?</p>
<p>B: Indeed, before the Henan war, both Chongqing and the Communists were promoting the so-called "June Counteroffensive," which had the momentum of echoing the British, American, and Chongqing troops' operations in Myanmar and the American troops' operations in the Pacific. Moreover, in fact, there have been major changes in the Chinese battlefield recently. The US Air Force in Chongqing has been strengthened, and it has been delusionally using the Chinese mainland as a base to bomb the Japanese mainland. What is particularly noteworthy is that the US Air Force, which has always focused on the construction of coastal bases in Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces, has recently attempted to move towards North China and the Northwest. With Lanzhou, Tianshui, Baoji, Hanzhong, and other places as rear bases, and Xi'an, Luoyang, Lushi, Ankang, Neixiang, and Laohokou as forward bases, there is a clear ambition to attack North China and then disturb the Japanese rear. After this Henan campaign, the ambition of the United States and its allies has been completely shattered, and the great impact on the international war situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>A: Strictly speaking from a military point of view, what is the significance of this war?</p>
<p>B: Shattering the so-called June counteroffensive plan is the first gain in the international situation and also in the military. Second, it proves with the fact of victory that the US Air Force in Chongqing is useless and not enough to assist the Chongqing army. Third, the "central elite" that Chongqing boasted of as "trained for several years" and "preparing for a counteroffensive" suffered a collapse. Taking only the section northwest of Dengfeng as an example, the Chongqing Eighth Fifth and Twenty-Ninth Army had a strength of more than 70,000 and were on the verge of complete annihilation. Fourth, the Japanese army occupied important military points in Henan and even the whole country? And gained the initiative in future operations. Fifth, the Communist armies have recently shown a tendency to launch large-scale guerrilla campaigns in North China. After this Henan campaign, their rear was threatened, and the New Fourth Army in Central China has always echoed the Communist Army in North China. After this Henan operation, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army have lost contact. Therefore, this battle has a decisive significance for the entire Chinese war situation.</p>
<p>A: Does the so-called decisive significance mean that it also has a considerable impact on politics?</p>
<p>B: This is also very obvious. First, in Chongqing, what has been used to maintain the morale of the people in recent years is the so-called "actively preparing for a counteroffensive" and "approaching the final victory." At the same time, with the Henan front line as a barrier, it has tried its best to plan and promote the so-called "Northwest Construction" movement, the blockade of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region of the Communist Party of China, the Chongqingization of Xinjiang's politics, and the appeasement of the Hui people in Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are all being promoted under the instigation of Britain and the United States. In the Henan War, the Japanese army directly forced Tongguan, the screen of the Northwest has been withdrawn, and there is no more talk of "construction," and the failure of the Henan War is to shake the morale of the rear, and the mood of pessimism and despair will be stronger. Second, in the peace zone, the political field is actively expanding, including most of the fertile land of Anhui and Henan. If we start from reforming politics and improving people's livelihood, the impact will be even greater, which is enough to make the people's hearts in Chongqing tend to peace more and more.</p>
<p>A: I think the economic significance seems to be also very important, because the Jinghan Road has been opened, the peaceful area has been expanded, and the material exchange between Central China and North China can be promoted more smoothly and effectively. Soon after, the Yuehan Railway will be opened, and there is also considerable expectation for trade not only between Central China and South China but also with Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>B: As you said, the Central Plains has always been the oldest base for our nation's development, with abundant products, the most important of which are agricultural products such as wheat, soybeans, and cotton, and mineral products such as coal and other important military resources. Now the main transportation lines are in the hands of the Japanese army, and after the Japanese army occupied the Jinghan and Longhai Roads, the Yellow River water conservancy project, which has been related to the lives of tens of millions of people for many years, can be actively launched under the technical guidance and cooperation of the Allied forces. In the future, there will be greater expectations for the people's livelihood and even the economic construction of the Central Plains. Even the forgetful people in Shanghai seem to have a deep impression of the tragedy of the great drought in Henan in the winter before last and in the spring and summer of last year! We hope that the relevant authorities will seize this opportunity to make a long-term plan.</p>
<p>A: That's right. If the National Government can immediately promote benevolent governance under such a war record of the Japanese army, so that hundreds of millions or even tens of millions of our compatriots in the Central Plains can celebrate their rebirth and seek common restoration after natural disasters, and promote comprehensive peace, on the one hand, it can also cooperate with the Allied forces, share their labor, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai District Rice Movement Authority Orders the Lifting of Restrictions and Plans to Formulate an Outline for Rice Measures in Beijing and Shanghai</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) - In order to regulate the people's food supply, the government's Enrichment Bureau previously stipulated restrictions on rice movement in three provinces and two cities. Since its implementation, the people's food supply has been secure. Now, as the rice purchase work of the Rice Control Association gradually progresses, and the price of rice varies greatly in different regions, the food supply for the people is not smooth. In order to eliminate this phenomenon, it is particularly necessary to balance rice prices in various regions. Therefore, the government authorities have specifically removed rice from Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, which requires approval from the Business Control Association for materials transported to the control line in the Shanghai area, in order to ease the rice movement control of the Shanghai area's flow control line. At the same time, in order to enrich the food supply for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai, a "Temporary Measures Outline for Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" has been drafted, stipulating that all rice grains transported to Beijing and Shanghai, except for those purchased by the Rice Control Association, can be freely sold, but those who illegally manipulate prices and attempt to hoard will be severely punished. This measure not only allows rice sources to be unblocked, but also allows rice prices in various regions to be reasonably regulated. In particular, it can provide an appropriate solution to the current serious food problem in Beijing and Shanghai, which is of great benefit to the stability of people's livelihoods. The authorities are also adopting the same approach in this regard, and will severely punish Japanese merchants who violate regulations. Appropriate cooperation will be provided for policies regarding China, so it is hoped that the general public and rice merchants will deeply understand the government's intentions and cooperate in implementing policies. The Rice Control Association and the Rice Grain Trade Association should further develop their self-governance spirit and engage in rice procurement work to balance supply and demand, stabilize prices, and fulfill the important task of stabilizing people's livelihoods. Regarding this matter, Vice President Zhou of the Executive Yuan and the Japanese Embassy authorities issued important statements on the 24th. The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, the Commander of the China Area Fleet, and the Plenipotentiary Ambassador to China also formally announced on the same day. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Vice President Zhou's Statement</p>
<p>The government previously imposed restrictions on rice movement in three provinces and two cities in order to centrally manage and regulate the people's food supply. Now, the purchase work of the Rice Grain Control Committee is gradually progressing, and there is a need to balance rice prices in various regions. Therefore, rice has been specifically removed from Article 6 of the Temporary Regulations on the Restriction of Wartime Material Movement, which requires approval from the National Business Control Association for materials transported to the control zone in the Shanghai area. The Rice Grain Control Committee has been ordered to expand the scope of passport issuance, allowing legitimate rice merchants and farmers to transport rice smoothly. This move aims to ease the restrictions on rice movement in the Shanghai area's control line, unblock rice sources under reasonable management, and further regulate rice prices, so that farmers can concentrate on production, and both urban and rural areas can benefit. In the future, the Rice Control Association and the Rice Grain Trade Association will continue to develop their self-governance spirit and engage in rice procurement to ensure that supply and demand are balanced and prices are stable. As for the current rationing system, there is also a need for improvement. A temporary measures outline for rice for the citizens of Beijing and Shanghai has been drafted and will be implemented first in Shanghai. However, after the easing of restrictions, those who violate laws and regulations, take the opportunity to manipulate prices, seek selfish gains, and attempt to hoard will still be severely punished by the competent authorities. Once discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. As it concerns the stability of people's livelihoods, it is hoped that the general public will understand this intention and assist the government in promoting management policies.</p>
<p>Kyoto and Shanghai Citizens' Temporary Food Rice Management Summary</p>
<p>This outline is based on the principle of unification, Yu Chongyu regulations for food rice in the two cities.</p>
<p>Any vendors approved by the Rice Silk Association and rice shops registered in the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai, and nearby farmers who transport their own harvested rice to the urban area for sale, may apply to the Rice Silk Association for a passport for transporting rice. However, the Rice Silk Association will purchase rice for the military police and important industries according to the number of parts, and the number of parts to be purchased is stipulated as follows: (A) Vendors who have paid off the original Cheng Dan will be purchased 20 percent. (B) Vendors who have not paid off the original Cheng Dan will be purchased 40 percent. (C) Vendors who have not ordered Cheng Dan, or new entrants, will be purchased 30 percent. The purchase price of micro-purchased rice will be determined from time to time according to the actual cost plus reasonable profits, except as otherwise provided in item B of Article 1. Grain transported to the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai may be bought and sold at free prices, except for those to be purchased by the Rice Silk Association. However, in order to prevent hoarding and profiteering, the scope of buying and selling shall be determined separately by the municipal government in conjunction with the Rice Silk Association.</p>
<p>If rice grains are transported in without a rice silk club passport, they shall be treated as private rice and punished in accordance with the central laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The Rice Silk Association will designate import ports in the two cities of Kyoto and Shanghai and set up temporary licensing offices. It may also temporarily issue general transport passports to rice merchants who have not applied for a passport.</p>
<p>The above passports shall be issued by the Rice Silk Association in accordance with the original application for the issuance of rice procurement certificates and rice transport deliberation procedures.</p>
<p>This outline shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation, and the same shall apply when modifications are made.</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>The Temporary Rules for the Movement of Goods in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River Region, promulgated on March 11, 32nd year of the Republic of China, have been amended as follows and will be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>In Schedule 1, Item 3, the phrase "Goods limited to be transported to the Shanghai area" shall be removed from the section "Rice" (excluding glutinous rice). In Schedule 2, the section "Moving into the Shanghai area" shall be removed from the section "2 kg of rice". May 25, 33rd year of the Republic of China. Commander-in-Chief of the China Dispatch Army, Commander of the China Area Fleet, Imperial Decree Ambassador of Great Japan.</p>
<p>Talks by the Japanese Embassy Authorities</p>
<p>In order to ease the current restrictions on the movement of goods and promote the smooth flow of goods under reasonable control, the Chinese government and the Japanese authorities have long held the same approach. As a result of the agreement between the Chinese and Japanese Wealth Bureaus, rice has been excluded from the Shanghai peripheral collection rules, so that rice transported into Shanghai can be carried out smoothly without any obstacles under the reasonable control of the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Rice Control Association. It goes without saying that this will have a great effect on stabilizing people's livelihoods. However, if unscrupulous merchants take advantage of this revision of the transportation rules to speculate and hoard, or violate the control of the Chinese competent Wealth Bureau and the Rice Control Association, resulting in rising rice prices, the Chinese authorities have established decisive measures to deal with this, which is naturally the case. The Japanese authorities concerned will also adopt the same approach and will severely punish Japanese merchants who violate regulations. Appropriate cooperation will also be provided for the suppression of China. In short, it is hoped that all rice grain operators, regardless of Chinese or Japanese nationality, will understand the true meaning of this lifting of control and the great cause of the authorities and food stability.</p>

<h3>The Japanese General Headquarters Announces the Battle Results of the Japanese Army in Henan, and the Chongqing Army in Luoyang is Under Japanese Surveillance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:30 p.m. on the 24th:</p>
<p>In the Henan region, the Japanese army and the powerful units of the Japanese army newly descending from Shanxi echoed each other, defeating the main force of the Chongqing First War Zone Army, and are currently continuing to fight.</p>
<p>Luoyang is currently under surveillance by a part of the Japanese army, and there are about three divisions of the isolated Chongqing army around the area.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the operation, until May 21, the main battle results confirmed are as follows: 34,100 bodies of the Chongqing army were recovered, 9,400 prisoners were captured, 18 aircraft were shot down (3 of which are unconfirmed), 206 cannons, 725 light and heavy machine guns, about 1,000 rifles, 108 cars, large locomotives, and 123 railway freight cars were seized. The Japanese army's losses were 880 soldiers killed in battle.</p>
<p>Zhengzhou, 24th (Central News Agency) - More than ten divisions of the Chongqing army under the command of Jiang Dingwen and several divisions of Hu Zongnan's army from the Eighth War Zone, totaling about 200,000 people, previously attempted to counterattack in the area west of Luoyang and south of the Yellow River in Xin'an and Yiyang. Due to the fierce offensive of the Japanese army, they are currently planning to flee southwest. Therefore, the Japanese army in the area, in addition to using a part to monitor the Chongqing army in Luoyang, is using powerful units with tanks as the main force to annihilate the main force of the Chongqing army in that area. On the 12th, with the cooperation of the air force, a large-scale offensive and defensive battle was launched. The Japanese army's vanguard, after causing the 12th Army under the command of Tang Enbo to collapse near Luoyang, thoroughly ravaged Songxian. Another Japanese army advanced westward along the Luoyang River and suppressed Changshui Town in the Luoyang River Valley west of Luoyang on the 16th, and launched a fierce attack on the 17th Division of the 96th Army stationed in Luoning, intending to completely eliminate it. Then, on the tenth day, they broke into Luoning, cut off the Longhai Line, and echoed the Japanese army units to form a triangular encirclement of Xin'an Guanyintang Luoning, and pursued the Chongqing army of about five divisions, totaling 35,000 people, which had retreated from the Luoyang Plain, and completely annihilated them. In this short period, about 20 divisions of the 6th Army and 13th Division under the command of Jiang Dingwen in the First War Zone, and the army of Tang Enbo and Hu Zongnan in the Eighth War Zone, totaling about 200,000 people, were either wiped out or collapsed.

<h3>"Navy Spirit" Seen in the Lens - A Dialogue Between Photography Reporters of the Mainichi Shimbun</h3>
<p>Two dispatched photography reporters of the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, Tatsuro Niimi and Kaneharu Yamamoto, served in the Southern Front for about a year, going in and out of gunfire and taking many photos. The two gentlemen heard and witnessed in detail the hard fighting of the Japanese Navy on the front lines. The following is a dialogue between the two gentlemen. Difficulties of Photography</p>
<p>Niimi: Everything I heard and saw there was a microcosm of the captivating Navy spirit. Everything captured by the camera is extremely precious. Yamamoto: It is impossible to take photos in the dense forest, even during the day it is very dark. The dense forests of New Guinea are truly untouched forests. Large trees with diameters of about six feet rise branchless to the sky, about one hundred and fifty feet high. The treetops are lush and dense like umbrellas, blocking the sunlight. The noble figures of the warriors fighting in this kind of forest are now all captured by the lens and transmitted to the rear.</p>
<p>Niimi: The humidity that fills the dense forest like fine rain is the enemy of the camera. The photosensitive film melts quickly due to high heat and humidity. However, we put each roll of film into a specially made can and sealed it with tape. Only ten rolls are stored in this specially made can with desiccant. Once a film is loaded into the camera, it is useless if it is not used for two or three days.</p>
<p>The Troops in the Dense Forest</p>
<p>Yamamoto: The coastline is generally a dry, hot zone of coconut groves, suitable for living, but it has become a bombing target for enemy planes, so the troops have to set up camps in the dense forests where even the natives cannot live. The soldiers live in crude huts built on wooden piles. The ground is muddy every day, so they build wooden piles of coconut trees to walk to the neighboring house. Due to humidity and dryness, things that are washed will not dry after three days, and in dry places, white mold will grow, and white shirts will turn black after washing. The smoke must be noted, as the lodging places will be easily discovered by enemy planes, so the warriors pay attention to even the smoke from cigarettes. Cooking is done one or two kilometers away. When enemy planes come, cooking is done in the dark with the fire covered. Water is extremely difficult to obtain, and when it is necessary to wash, they can only boil the muddy water from the smelly swamps and apply it. Drinking water is obtained by distillation.</p>
<p>Niimi: There are tropical malaria, tropical ulcers, and other terrible diseases there. This is a story from ○○ Island; a soldier who returned from the front line, without resting, took out a paper knife from his pocket, ran out of the dormitory, and in a place where sunlight shone through a gap in the leaves of a nearby tree, the soldier spread a piece of paper in his hand. When asked "What are you doing?", he said he was drying it. "What is that piece of paper?" "It's a letter, a letter my child sent half a year ago." The paper, stained with sweat and mud, was written with childish false characters. For the past half a year, this soldier has been wearing a warm shirt and has not found a sunny place to dry it, so that this letter cannot be seen clearly. This kind of scene is truly moving, but this is a posture that cannot be expressed with a photograph.</p>
<p>Dense Forest Battle</p>
<p>Niimi: Because the line of sight is narrow, dense forest battles are exactly the same as night battles. There is always the possibility of engaging the enemy. The soldiers move stealthily, holding their breath, with weeds decorated on their helmets, and advance through the mud. Suddenly breaking forward, cracks appear in front, and beads of sweat the size of soybeans stream down their faces. Clothes are pulled by thorns, and military boots step into the mud. Guns and swords are occasionally illuminated by a line of sunlight shining down from the treetops, glittering. That is truly the solemnity of warriors. This is truly the best and most unadorned material for photography.</p>
<p>Yamamoto: Sound really has an impact on the nerves. The dense forest is silent as death, but from time to time, the wind blows the branches and leaves, making a whirring sound. The sound of about twenty wild boars acting as a group is a killing sound, and the sound of trees falling suddenly without wind often mixes together. The soldiers are most afraid of the situation where trees naturally fall due to decay. This is truly a true story of wind noise, a story of the dense forest battle in southern New Guinea. The soldier on the front line was tripped by a tree and fell. Nearby parrots were startled by the sound and flew up. There are many snow-white parrots there, cackling and cackling. At this time, the cries of dozens of parrots made the warriors nervous all night, thinking they had been discovered by the enemy, preparing to fight the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. However, when they arrived at the enemy's position, machine guns, rifles, food, and ammunition were scattered all over the ground. The soldiers laughed. The parrot's cries startled the enemy and they fled in disarray. Scattered weapons and ammunition indicate their panic.</p>
<p>Naval Battle</p>
<p>Niimi: When turning the troops from Beira Beira Island, we encountered three enemy cruisers, four destroyers, and many torpedo boats and launched a fierce night battle. I was on the flagship, and immediately picked up the camera and went to the deck to prepare to capture the scene of the naval battle, but I could not take photos at night. The enemy was firing colored bullets from a distance of 16,000 meters. These colored bullets looked like two blood-red pieces of charcoal flying side by side. All the lights on the warship were controlled, and the active situation of the soldiers could not be captured, so I took the camera and had nothing to do, and served as a lookout with the military doctor and the chief accountant. The military leader suddenly shouted: "○○ has been destroyed." ○○ was our destroyer. When I looked, the area near the front turret was surrounded by a blood-red fireball. It was clearly visible in the dark night. I couldn't help but grit my teeth. Enemy bullets seemed to be aimed at this fire and concentrated their fire. Countless pillars of water were stirred up. Before long, the fire on the turret was extinguished, and the rear deck caught fire again. The warship began to sink from the bow. The fire was fierce, surrounding the entire ship, and the turret caught fire a second time. Ah! It sank. Just as the front turret was almost completely submerged in the water, there was a loud explosion. The sunken cannon was still firing the last bullet towards the enemy ship. A cannon half-sunken in the sea was still firing. Is there such a terrible thing in the history of world naval warfare? Only our navy. I still cannot forget that last cannon sound. In this naval battle, a great victory was achieved, sinking one cruiser and three destroyers, and our side also lost one destroyer.</p>
<p>Lookout on a Deserted Island</p>
<p>Yamamoto: There is a lookout on Adi Island in southern New Guinea. This place is suitable for enemy planes to attack New Guinea from Australia, so the lookouts are watching day and night for the discovery of enemy planes and enemy submarines. It is a deserted island, and food is transported there once every three months, which is a life isolated from the world. I once took that liaison ship to the island. When the lookouts saw the shape of the ship, they waved towels and shirts on the shore. The ship approached the shore and ran to the beach with a rustling sound, asking each soldier: "What did you bring? Are there any letters from home?" Seeing these dark and energetic soldiers, I couldn't help but be moved. The whole island is a dense forest, and they climb up the coconut trees, 150 feet high, on the shore to carry out their lookout duties. Apart from the liaison ship that comes once every three months, there is nothing else on this island to comfort these warriors. Sometimes, sea turtles five feet long come to the beach to lay their eggs, which is the only rare guest. This is a place where earthquakes often occur. One day, a great change occurred on the island due to an earthquake. The island sank due to the earthquake. The beach and hills were gradually sinking into the sea before their eyes. The lookout reported to the base by radio: "Amao Island is currently sinking due to an earthquake, but as long as there is a piece of wood, we will continue to keep watch." But the base has no ship that can be dispatched to rescue them. That tragic radio message kept coming, and the people at the base could only pray to God. Fortunately, the sinking did not last long and stopped, and the whole island was safe, and it is now a joke. What if it had really sunk completely? The lookouts on this island would have fulfilled tasks unknown to people and died in their posts!</p>
<p>Niimi: There is also such a lookout at ○○ at the southernmost tip of New Ireland. That is the necessary route for enemy planes to raid Rabaul from the Solomon Islands. Relying on the reports from this lookout, Rabaul can know twenty minutes earlier that enemy planes are coming to attack. The location of the lookout is a cave dug on a steep cliff. The liaison ship only comes once every six months. Accompanied by lizards and sea turtles, they are vigilant day and night, and their hardship is truly beyond words. Moreover, if you want to send a telegram, there is no other way. There are many such lookouts in the South China Sea, and they have deployed a strong picket network. There are also many lookouts that have sent out radio messages saying "○○ enemy planes are attacking, and we are currently fighting back," and many have ultimately been honorably sacrificed. We should take the spirit of these warriors on the front lines as our spirit, and the rear should share the same hardships as the front lines. (Xiang: Translated from the May 13 Mainichi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Marshal Togo's Complete Collection of Sayings</h3>
<h3>Be a Warrior Even When Sick</h3>
<p>We must be warriors even when it comes to illness. What is meant here by being a warrior against illness is to follow the doctor's instructions in all things, never act rashly, rest fully, and only do so when the doctor permits. This may seem like something that goes without saying, but in practice, it is surprisingly difficult to adhere to, especially for young people. Because they are full of vigor and vitality, they act impulsively, deeply afraid of delaying their duties. There are often those who do not fully comply with the doctor's instructions, resulting in the recurrence of the disease, which in turn causes delays. Therefore, to restrain oneself and endure, and to only act when the doctor permits, is what can be called being a warrior against illness.</p>
<h3>Students Should Focus on Their Duties</h3>
<p>As civilization progresses and human intelligence develops, spiritual education is most necessary. Students today have their own duties as students, so they must concentrate on their duties and not be lazy or self-willed. To rashly engage in matters outside of their duties is not appropriate. This is how one must act in life. If one does not devote all their efforts, nothing in the world can be accomplished.</p>
<h3>Do Not Distort the Facts</h3>
<p>What people do is not necessarily always judged correctly, but if one believes it to be right, then no matter what others say, one must never distort the truth.</p>
<h3>Thrift</h3>
<p>It is best if income exceeds expenditure.</p>
<h3>Simplicity</h3>
<p>Simplicity is the first requirement for fulfilling one's duties. If one is not simple, one will eventually imitate extravagance that is outside of one's duties, and ultimately fall into evil ways and become dishonest, leading to the tarnishing of one's reputation. How can one then fulfill one's duties? Be cautious, be cautious! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Plans Electricity Saving Measures to Rationally Distribute to Producers and Consumers</h3>
<p>Recently, this city has implemented a second round of universal electricity conservation measures. While various sectors are cooperating in their implementation, they are also hoping that the authorities will adjust the current system to ensure that electricity conservation and increased production are pursued concurrently, so that the industrial sector does not fall into a state of paralysis. Yesterday, reporters specifically inquired with Director Ye of the Bureau of Public Utilities about this issue, and he agreed to release the following statement: "Conserving electricity is originally one part of conserving resources and is a necessary measure during wartime. However, how to achieve rationalization is an extremely complex problem that urgently needs to be solved. The method implemented half a year ago was a universal reduction system, and this time the reduction method is still the same. Although the procedure is simple, it is not entirely rational in practice, so those who are accustomed to wasting on weekdays may not thoroughly save, while those who actually need electricity already feel the hardship deeply. In general, the impact of reduced electricity on production is a serious economic problem. At this critical stage of decisive battle, increasing production is a pressing and urgent plan. If electricity conservation reduces production capacity, it is truly a case of gaining less than is lost. This bureau, which is responsible for public utilities throughout the city, attaches great importance to this issue and is currently planning in detail to ensure that the amount of supply needed for production can be maintained appropriately, while extravagant consumption will be strictly limited. The daily electricity consumption of households will also be fairly distributed according to their actual needs." It is heard that this plan will be implemented as soon as it has been discussed with the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Terrorist Drill in Huangpu District Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Huangpu District of the First Police Bureau of this city held a terrorist drill yesterday (24th) afternoon around 3:00 p.m. at the entrance of the Hamilton Building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. Three people posing as terrorists first fired shots at the scene and then fled. When the branch bureau received the report, it blocked off the entire district and dispatched a large number of detectives, led by Branch Chief Kobayashi and Deputy Branch Chief Liu Ya Ying, to the scene to join military police in searching for the hypothetical criminals. The Self-Defense Corps assisted in maintaining order, and the drill was quite realistic. It ended at 4:10 p.m., and the blockade was lifted, restoring traffic.</p>
<h3>Second Police Bureau Orders Assistance in Arresting Those Privately Collecting Pig Tax</h3>
<p>Recently, it was discovered in the urban area that counterfeit tax stamps and certificates of pig tax, which had been announced as abolished, were being used to privately collect pig tax, which is disrupting tax revenue and violating criminal law. After receiving the report, the Second Police Bureau, in order to assist in maintaining tax administration, specifically ordered all subordinate branch bureaus yesterday to assist in arresting and punishing those involved.</p>
<h3>Dr. Sasaki Spoke Yesterday on the Agricultural Situation of Various Countries; Third Lecture to be Held Today</h3>
<p>The "Wartime Academic Lecture" jointly sponsored by the News and this newspaper, first hired Japanese agricultural authority Dr. Sasaki as a lecturer. After arriving in Shanghai and taking a short rest, he has already begun his lectures in recent days. The first lecture and symposium were held at the Agricultural College of National Shanghai University at 3:00 p.m. on the 23rd, with over two hundred teachers and students, including President Zhao. A banquet was hosted by the school in the evening, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Yesterday afternoon, the second lecture was held at the Japan-China Club, attended by about a hundred students from Nantong University, the China Agricultural Technical School, and the Agricultural Textile School. The topics for both lectures were "Observation of Japan, China, the United States, and the United Kingdom from an Agricultural Perspective," analyzing the agricultural situation of various countries and elaborating on the differences between China and Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States in agriculture. He also explained that China and Japan have absolute commonalities in terms of cultivated land area, agricultural production rate, the content of other plants and animals, and agricultural technology and management methods. Therefore, from an agricultural point of view, China and Japan naturally have the necessity of mutual cooperation and friendly relations. The lecture lasted about two hours. The third lecture will be held at St. John's University at 3:30 p.m. today.</p>
<h3>Spokesman for the Japanese Army Discusses the Situation in Henan, Fall of Luoyang Imminent</h3>
<p>The spokesman for the Allied Japanese Shanghai Army Press Department, met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in the city yesterday (24th) at 2:00 p.m. as usual, and elaborated on the damage suffered by the Chongqing side in this Henan operation, and the impact on Liu's political economy. A record of his remarks is as follows: Regarding the detailed course of this Henan operation, because the Japanese General Headquarters has not yet issued a statement, it is not convenient to announce it first. However, the biggest problem at present is the fall of Luoyang. Before Luoyang falls, we cannot talk about reaching a final conclusion. However, to date, many important cities have been occupied by the Japanese army, and the ultimate goal of the Japanese army should be Luoyang. Now the Japanese army is gathering all its strength to capture Luoyang. Although the battle is fierce, the progress of the Japanese army is surprisingly rapid. Overall, in this operation, the Chongqing army annihilated by the Japanese army totaled six armies and twenty divisions, about 180,000 soldiers. Therefore, although Luoyang has not yet fallen, it is imminent, so the first phase goal can be said to have been completed, and the Japanese army's destruction of the enemy's forces has also reached the expected goal. The troops of Tang Enbo and Jiang Dingwen of the Chongqing side have been fatally hit.</p>
<p>Elite Troops Heavily Defeated</p>
<p>What we can pay more attention to is that Tang Enbo and Jiang Dingwen, known as the most elite troops of the Chongqing side, have now suffered the most tragic defeat and will no longer be able to restore their strength. Furthermore, the chaotic command of the enemy's army is also countless. To give an example, when the battle was at its fiercest, the Chongqing military authorities once ordered Tang Enbo to firmly defend Dengfeng and Mianxian. However, at this time, Tang's troops had already fled at the first sign of trouble, which shows that the subordinates had no will to fight, and even more remarkably, Tang did not know where his subordinates were. The state of chaos was so great that it was truly laughable. The reason why Luoyang has not yet fallen is that the Japanese army is now gradually shrinking the encirclement, dividing its troops in all directions. Once it is completely surrounded, it can be captured in one fell swoop. There are currently about three divisions of the Chongqing army in Luoyang. The Japanese side's purpose is to annihilate these forces completely, leaving none alive, and then occupy the city. In this way, it can achieve the dual purpose of annihilating the main force of the enemy and occupying the city. Therefore, the Japanese army's attack on Luoyang is not too hasty, and that is the reason. Moreover, the offensives launched on other fronts will not be affected by the failure of Luoyang to fall.</p>
<p>Nujiang War a Bluff</p>
<p>To further elaborate, the first phase of this Henan operation has been completed, and now we are in the second phase. Because the Chongqing side completely failed in this operation, it had to find ways to create various arguments, launching an offensive in the Nujiang area and propagandizing the recapture of Myitkyina. If we criticize it from a military perspective, this is entirely a propaganda strategy, and it would not be wrong to say that they are "trying to save face." Let us try to analyze the point of crossing the Nujiang River as follows: Although the Chongqing side has been vigorously promoting the operation of crossing the Nujiang River recently, there has been no action. In the Nujiang area, the troops under Wei Lihuang of the Chongqing side have only a few divisions, and they are attempting to cross the river, but the strength of a few divisions is already extremely small, and the number that can actually cross the river is even smaller. They attempted to reach Tengchong and Longling, but so far all they have gained are a few bridgeheads. They attempted to transport a large army in a steady stream, but they have now been surrounded by the Japanese force and will soon be annihilated. Therefore, the military spokesman of the Chongqing side also admitted that the Nujiang war was stalled due to rain. Although the Chongqing side attaches great importance to this war, its strength is small, and it is certain that it will not be able to achieve its wishes. Furthermore, on the Myitkyina side, the enemy is also vigorously promoting the occupation of the railway line, but no matter how much they advocate it, we can know that all that the enemy is propagating is purely fabricated by observing the strong strength of the Japanese army. Especially in terms of supplies, they are even more helpless. Although the Chongqing side is spreading rumors about air replenishment of supplies, it is all a dream. The military spokesman of the Chongqing side has also admitted this point. Therefore, the reason why the Chongqing side is so vigorously propagandizing is to cover up the disastrous defeat in the Henan operation.</p>
<p>Impact of Henan Operation on Chongqing</p>
<p>Now, let me briefly explain the impact of this Henan operation on Chongqing:</p>
<p>(1) The most elite Tang Enbo army of the Chongqing side has been completely annihilated, causing the United States to doubt the faith in the Chongqing side. (2) The public opinion centers of the United Kingdom and the United States are concerned about whether the Chongqing side can continue to fight independently in the future. The reason why the United Kingdom and the United States are concerned about this point is that they want to use the power of Chongqing to consume the Japanese force and to make it a base for fighting Japan in mainland China. This is the sinister trick of the United Kingdom and the United States. However, now that the most elite Tang Enbo army of the Chongqing side has been so badly defeated, it is no wonder that the United Kingdom and the United States doubt whether the Chongqing side can continue to fight independently. The victory bonds of the Chongqing side have also plummeted in value in London due to the failure of this Henan operation, which further shows the decline of Chongqing's international status. The United Kingdom and the United States further stated that the two major reasons for the disastrous defeat of the Chongqing side in this Henan operation were: (1) the opposition of the Chongqing Communists, (2) the uneven opinions within Chongqing. In particular, the United Kingdom and the United States are even more dissatisfied with Chiang's dictatorial politics. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States further interfered in the internal affairs of the Chongqing side. In particular, the air force bases of the United States in Chongqing were successively crushed by the Japanese army. Out of pain, they turned their anger on the enemy for not being able to protect their bases. Furthermore, regarding the issue of adjusting the relations between the Chongqing Communists, the Communist representative Lin Zuhan and the Chongqing representatives Wang Shijie and Zhang Zhizhong held several informal meetings, but these meetings can be said to be held entirely under the pressure of the United Kingdom and the United States. In fact, the meetings will never have results, and there is no talk of cooperation, only increasing the trouble of the Chongqing side. The reason why the United Kingdom and the United States hope that the Chongqing Communists will hold meetings is to seek their peaceful coexistence and full utilization by the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the purpose of the United Kingdom and the United States is definitely not to liberate and revive China, but only to hold them as a tool to win the war, so that the Chinese nation will never see the light of day.</p>
<h3>Price Countermeasures Committee Ready</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen price management, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently convened with the Municipal Government and relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies to form a Price Countermeasures Committee in Shanghai, in order to seek a rational solution to prices. Now, the committee is actively preparing through the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Municipal Government and other relevant parties, and it is basically ready. It is heard that the position of chairman will be concurrently held by Mr. Wu Songgao. The main work in the future will focus on local prices in Shanghai, obtain strict management, in order to adapt to the wartime economic system, and balance prices in various places, stabilize people's livelihoods, and never allow the ugly phenomenon of price spikes to occur again.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Strike, Being Persuaded to Resume Work</h3>
<p>The postal authorities previously felt that the employees' wages were too low and the postal economy was suffering huge losses, so they submitted a request to the government for approval to increase postal rates by 200% from the 16th of this month. After this price increase, the first step was to improve the employees' treatment, and to increase their salaries and wages by one time starting this month. The authorities have made their best efforts to improve the employees' lives. The employees, on the other hand, demanded a gold and rice subsidy system, and suddenly went on strike on the 22nd. Beforehand, they did not send representatives to contact the authorities, nor did they obtain the consent of the labor union. Since the strike occurred, the postal authorities have actively guided them, and the postal labor union has also tried its best to persuade and negotiate. However, the postal authorities have refused any conditions because they are unable to do anything. Yesterday (24th), the postal authorities and the Shanghai Postal Labor Union separately issued statements and urgent notices, urging them to resume work quickly, in order to maintain postal operations and seek the convenience of the public.</p>
<h3>Naval Day Commemoration, Famous Painting Exhibition Opens Tomorrow</h3>

Now, in accordance with his mother's instructions, he has collected the large sum of money donated for the celebration, and requested the original sponsors to distribute it to welfare organizations in Beijing and Shanghai to be used for welfare work.</p>

<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Electricity Saving Principles</h3>
<p>The words of Director Ye of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities (see today's newspaper) on the implementation of the second round of electricity conservation measures in this city, and the need to distinguish between the rational allocation of producers and consumers, is a very important issue. The electricity saving measures set six months ago were a universal reduction system. As a result, consumers who are accustomed to wasting on weekdays may not save thoroughly, while producers who actually need electricity feel the hardship deeply. This time the electricity saving measures are still a universal reduction, so the result is that for producers, reducing production capacity due to electricity conservation is indeed a case of gaining less than is lost. Therefore, reducing production due to electricity conservation is definitely not the original intention of electricity conservation, nor is it a phenomenon that should exist amidst calls for increased production.</p>
<p>We strongly advocate that electricity conservation should absolutely limit extravagant consumption, such as entertainment venues closing early, restaurants shortening evening business hours, hotels and homes prohibiting all-night card games, and stopping the use of household electric refrigerators and electric fans, etc. The power company should reduce the electricity supply to extravagant consumers to the minimum. On the other hand, for legitimate production enterprises and social welfare enterprises, the electricity supply should not only not be reduced universally in proportion to extravagant consumers, but should be strictly assessed for their actual needs and appropriately maintained or increased, in order to maintain their production capacity and maintain their service efficiency.</p>
<p>It is worth repeating that the principle of saving electricity should distinguish between the rational allocation of consumers and producers.</p>

<p>Last Night's Film Speech Convention</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau and China Film Company, in celebration of Allied Nations' Naval Day, held a joint commemorative speech and film convention at the Dahua Grand Theater at 8:00 PM yesterday (24th). Naval officers from the Allied Nations were invited to speak. Director Jiong'an Lin of the Municipal Education Bureau, Director Zongyao Ma of the Publicity Department of China Film Company, and over a thousand faculty and staff from more than seventy middle and elementary schools in the city, including He'an First Normal School, Gezhi, and Yu Zhi, attended. From the Allied Nations side, Lieutenant Commander Teshima and Lieutenant Commander Shiota of the Naval Attache's Office in Shanghai were present, creating a lively atmosphere. Director Lin gave an opening speech. Then, Lieutenant Commander Teshima of the Allied Nations gave a speech: First, (1) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we have entered the stage of decisive battle. He discussed the past war situation, (2) the current situation in the Pacific theater, (3) the reasons why the enemy Americans are eager to counterattack, (4) the attitude of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific, and (5) the actual major battle results obtained since the naval battles, analyzing them in great detail. Finally, he said: The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the advocacy of Pan-Asianism by the national father Sun Yat-sen, and it was not newly created by Japan. Only through full cooperation between China and Japan can this goal be achieved. Now, places such as Nanyang have become very strong fortresses, just like the Great Wall built in the Qin Dynasty in China. He hoped that the Chinese people would work harder and cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia Holy War. The most important thing is spiritual cooperation, and the most important thing about spiritual cooperation is education. Everyone present today bears the heavy responsibility of education. In the past, Shanghai was bewitched by the evil forces of Britain and the United States, and now the remaining poison still exists. Eliminating the remaining poison is your responsibility. He hoped that everyone would guide the thinking of Chinese youth in order to complete the legitimate and truthful Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He believed that the Greater East Asia War will be completed soon. Then, Director Lin gave a thank-you speech, and the film "Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" was screened until it ended at 11:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Solving the Current Price Problem</h3>
<p>— Ren Ming</p>
<p>On the 21st of this month, the editorial column of the Economic Section of the Xinwen Bao published an article entitled "On the Narrativity of Prices," which believes that the current low-price policy adopted by the authorities has failed due to the lack of thorough overall control, the incomplete control mechanism, and the unsound personnel. The low-price policy has not only failed to achieve the expected results, but also caused production stagnation, material shortages, and periodic ladder-shaped price increases, increasing the suffering of the people. Finally, citing the point raised by the Japanese-language "Mainland News" of "trying to restore the natural form of prices as much as possible within the possible range," it suggests that informed people in the society consider abandoning the policy of controlling prices. This paper has very reasonable arguments regarding the failure of the current price policy, but it does not point out the direction and steps that the authorities should take after abandoning the convenient price policy. The author is not talented, so I will make a small contribution based on my knowledge, to supplement it.</p>
<p>From the perspective of economic principles, the matter of controlling prices is a temporary solution. When the war first started, the problem of material supply had not yet reached a serious stage, and it was not unreasonable to adopt a policy of controlling prices at that time. However, due to various reasons, this policy has undoubtedly failed. At present, the supply of materials is becoming increasingly short, and increasing production seems difficult to achieve suddenly. Change price control to complete material control. In the past, prices have risen steadily. Although the reasons are extremely complex, the hoarding of materials by unscrupulous merchants, manipulating the market, and buying and selling repeatedly, which invisibly raised prices, is the biggest factor. If hoarding and speculation are not eliminated, there is no hope of suppressing prices. To eliminate such behavior, it is necessary to start controlling materials. The method of controlling materials can be implemented by the economic control mechanism to manage the buying and selling of merchants in various industries. It is stipulated that before merchants complete a transaction, they must first obtain proof from the same industry association and apply to the competent economic authority, which will review the nature of the transaction to determine whether it is legitimate and whether the transaction price is reasonable. If both the buyer and seller are in the industry, and the seller's asking price is reasonable, and the buyer's required quantity is not excessive (for example, a manufacturer purchases raw materials for no more than three months of consumption), then it may be approved. Conversely, if both the buyer and seller are not in the industry, then their business is obviously illegal and will not be approved.</p>
<p>As for the method of controlling commercial transactions, the first step is to start with registration. Notify merchants in all industries to register their goods so that the authorities can understand the inventory of materials and facilitate adjustments. The second step is to implement measures to restrict the movement of materials, stipulating that the transportation of materials must first be approved by the competent authority before it can be handled. All improper transactions are prohibited from moving materials. In other words, all materials are not allowed to be moved unless a permit has been obtained.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned plan to control materials can be implemented and supplemented by a sound execution mechanism and personnel organization, the results achieved will not only reach the following points: (1) It can eliminate hoarding and speculation and eliminate black market transactions. (2) It can correct selling prices and make prices fair naturally. (3) It can adjust surpluses and deficits, allocate raw materials, and prevent the transfer of main raw materials to secondary areas. (4) It can improve the rationing system for daily necessities and try to increase the number of rationed items. (5) It can strengthen the organization of industry associations.</p>
<p>If it is said that there are many types of materials and it is not easy to implement overall control, it may be helpful to start by controlling the daily necessities first, and then gradually extend to other items, suppressing prices and improving people's livelihood, which is deeply beneficial. I hope that insightful people in the society and relevant authorities will act quickly!</p>

<h3>"Yi Zhong Ren" Responds to Poor Women's Childbirth Assistance Movement, Midwives' Association Cooperates and Supports</h3>
<p>Since our office launched the childbirth assistance movement, it has aroused considerable sympathy from the society. In addition to Mr. Dan Yunhui's father generously donating 20,000 yuan in response, we have now received a donation of 10,000 yuan from Yi Zhong Ren and a letter of support from the Midwives' Association, benefiting poor women and being greatly admired.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read in your newspaper about the launch of the childbirth assistance movement for poor women, and I was deeply moved. In recent years, the population of our country has declined, and there is a need to encourage childbirth. Unfortunately, ordinary poor women find it difficult to make ends meet in their daily lives, and it is difficult for them to make appropriate arrangements once they give birth. Fortunately, your office is enthusiastically advocating and diligently handling this matter. I admire you very much and am willing to save on transportation costs to donate 10,000 yuan, and I hope that all sectors will respond enthusiastically, save and provide assistance, and benefit mothers. Yi Zhong Ren sincerely.</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I recently read in the newspaper that your office launched the childbirth assistance movement for the poor and needy. Your benevolent and righteous act is truly admirable. Our association is a group organization of midwives in this city. We are obligated to make efforts in our position. In addition to contacting relevant obstetrics hospitals separately, please notify us if midwives are needed to participate in the work. Our association will carefully dispatch capable members to provide services. Sincerely, Shanghai Special City Midwives' Association.</p>
<h3>Leprosy Association Fundraising</h3>
<p>As the saying goes: "It's better for a poor person not to get sick than to win the lottery." It can be seen that everyone considers getting sick to be an unfortunate event, let alone suffering from leprosy, which is even more unfortunate!</p>
<p>Based on this sympathy, the China Leprosy Relief Association established hospitals to accommodate them and clinics to treat them. It is obvious that in this time of high living costs, it is extremely difficult to maintain this relief work, so we have no choice but to call on people from all walks of life for help. It is reported that a fundraising campaign will be held for one month starting on May 24th. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists will provide more assistance.</p>
<p>Lost Key. Yesterday morning, I took the No. 17 tram from Sichuan Road Bridge to the Great World, then took the tram to Albert Road at the Eight Immortals Bridge. I lost a bunch of keys along the way, including the key to safe deposit box No. 2960. If anyone finds it, please return it to the Jiancheng Office of this newspaper. A reward of 200 yuan will be given.</p>

<p>— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Letter to My Sister (4)</p>
<p>Perhaps it is fitting for Ryufu, who is in a troubled mood, to live on the second floor of this desolate and old Kurihama Inn.</p>
<p>He slept all day on the faded and uneven tatami mats. The autumn sky seen from the open window changed from azure to pale yellow. At this time, the lights were turned on, and the sun had unknowingly set.</p>
<p>Because there were no guests, the bathhouse was not heated. The landlady said there was a bathhouse nearby, but he was very restless and had no mood to take a bath.</p>
<p>"Mr. Guest, are you just sleeping?"</p>
<p>The landlady brought dinner. There were saury, octopus, fresh local fish, etc. It looked plentiful, but Ryufu had no intention of eating. The talkative landlady, no matter how much she said, Ryufu remained silent, so the landlady felt helpless, opened the bedding, and went downstairs.</p>
<p>It was not yet seven o'clock, but Ryufu turned off the lights and went to bed. Having said that, falling asleep was not easy. The sound of clogs walking back and forth and the sound of radio coming from somewhere were really annoying.</p>
<p>Soon after, the sounds of clogs and radio subsided, but unexpectedly, the sound of waves was very clearly transmitted to the pillow. His eyes widened even more.</p>
<p>The silhouette of the warship seen during the day was always appearing before his eyes, no matter how he tried to shake it off. The naval second lieutenant wearing glasses looked majestic to Ryufu and smiled. If his physique were healthy, he would be wearing that officer's uniform next year.</p>
<p>(What's the point of thinking about such things now?)</p>
<p>He turned over. The tears that filled his eyes slipped and flowed onto the pillow.</p>
<p>(It's not just that I didn't become a naval officer. I didn't become a calligrapher either.)</p>
<p>He finally realized the reason why he had to come to this place to rest.</p>
<p>(Everything is over. I failed in every path. No matter how much I try to cheer up now, it's no use.)</p>
<p>It was truly a desperate mood. Then he would run back to his parents' knees, beg for forgiveness for his unfilial piety, endure the ridicule of the villagers, or perhaps work as a clerk in the local government office.</p>
<p>He thought it was time to write a letter to his sister, Eda.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ryufu jumped up and turned on the lights. He took out a fountain pen and stationery from his bag and ran to the filthy dining table.</p>
<p>—Eda, I…</p>
<p>Before he had finished writing the first few sentences, Ryufu felt overwhelmed by all the worries in his heart, so he held his head and cried bitterly. (9) (10) (3)</p>
