<h3 id="c1">全民戰爭 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>現代戰爭是整個被壓迫民族和整個侵略民族的角力。所謂全民族戰爭的意義有二，一是全國各地都是載塲，二是全國國民都是戰士，所以任何國民都要以戰士的姿態在戰塲上工作，整個國民力量的多少，工作時間的久　，就是決定戰爭勝負的主要因素。在全民族戰爭的過程中，國民的責任在貢獻力量，政府的責任在怎樣團結利和用國民力量，進一步更使國民力量永久不斷地新生。</p>
<p>富蘇莑氏在本月十三日本報星期評論衷說：「今日的需要，與其說是兵器增產或食糧增產，勿寗說是人和增產。如人和充溢於全國，則兵器自然可以增產，食糧也自然可以增產」。這是全民戰爭中的「一針見血」之論。因為人的力量高於一切，人的力量可以克服一切客觀的困難，所謂「人定勝天」的理論，並非是一句空話，却是有許許多多歷史的事實證明，有許許多多個人生活上的經歷。人和的意義就在團結和聯合國民的力量，團結和聯合的力量比起一般單獨的力量，自然偉大，自然持久。　云「衆志成城」，「衆擊易舉」，最足說明人和的偉大意義。</p>
<p>怎樣達到人和的目的？德富蘇峯氏所指示的有四點，爲政者第一要信賴國民，第二要尊重國民，第三要聽取國民之聲，第四要停止官僚本位政治，而事實國民本位政治。他所說的竟與我們平素時時刻刻提及的不約而同，可見這個民本的主張，古今中外都是一律的。凡是合乎這個規律的，平時可以興國，載時可以致勝。凡是不合這個規律的，得不到國民的擁護，得不到偉大的力量，那末，成功的希望自然也只是緣木而求魚了。</p>
<p>德富蘇莑氏唯一的信念在國民本位的立塲上，使全體國民心悅誠服地為國家出力，唯一實行的方法就在實施國民本位的政治。政府要誠心誠意地做國民的公　，替國民解除困難，替國民增進福利，政府不是官僚機關而是替全國國民服務的塲所。政府替老百姓做的事愈多，老百姓替國家出的力愈大，政府愈尊重老百姓，老百姓亦愈擁護政府。這樣，全國上下，意志一致，力量集合，以之攻敵，無敵不克。</p>
<p>我們常常說爭取民衆，其實民衆是不必爭取的，在賢明的政府之下，人民的來歸，如水之就下，莫之能禦。我們所說爭取民衆的本意，在乎政府本身，要振作起來，造成一個民衆自願來歸的局面。政府自動地革新，民衆自動地擁護，這是最最理想的局而。所以最要的還在政府本身怎樣的努力為民衆服務，為民衆謀福利，有一分的服務，一分的福利就自動地吸引着一分的民衆。政府要把政治上的成績爭取民衆，這是最最重要的一點。</p>
<p>全民戰爭必須以全民政治為前提。戰事愈緊張，民族力量的團結和聯合的需要愈迫切，政治上的國民本位化更重要，這是緊要關頭，願全國上下共勉之。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍在怒江沿線　採個別擊破戰術　激流天險渝軍反攻益困難 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>北緬前綫十四日中央社電　渝雲南遠征軍此次反攻目的，在打通北細援渝新路綫，以挽回頹勞，渝軍當局在怒江作戰屢次敗北之陳誠辭職後，特由衛立煌代理遠征軍司令，幷派遣最精銳之美式中堅將校輔佐，而恃空中運輸補給軍需，以期舉總力奪回怒江沿綫，然日軍精銳採用個別擊破戰術，渝軍渡怒江以來，僅雨閱月，已損害五萬餘人。渝軍前綫將兵，雖遭此重創，而指導者酋不稍　　，堅欲奪回日軍之戰略耍　，最近其在江東之精銳後備車，會數次強行渡河，因日軍作戰巧妙，渝軍徒自取淪亡而已。怒江之激流，黎江之天險，使渝軍更難維持兵站補給，怒江渝軍將校，頻向司令部要求急速空輸補給軍需，但以現在情形觀之，空中之來援，乃渝軍之唯一命脈，而空輸補給，因地理環境關係，常不得發見來援飛機。又　疾猖獗，際此雨季，病兵層出不窮，復因無藥醫治，致使將兵喪盡戰意，故逃走者為數甚大。各地遊擊隊因此種情形，被迫為暴徒，到處刧掠，渝軍佔領之村落民衆，常向正規軍訴苦，但正規軍因食糧缺乏，常以游擊隊之名，大肆掠奪，因此居民紛紛　叛，逃避日軍管區。近渝兵投降及逃亡者激增，被日軍捕虜一渝將校，曾就渝軍將士王某之狼狽談稱：渝第七十六師二十六團第二營長王某，因戰鬥不利，終於逃走，因此第二營大為混亂，部下亦先後逃亡，第七十六師長得報後，發出懸賞告示，此種現狀，不僅限於第七十六師，其他各地亦然。</p>
<h3 id="c3">湘日軍迭佔要地　正準備次期作戰　日大本營發表衡陽戰果 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日巾央社電　日大本營十四日下午三時發表：　湖南方面日軍逐次擊退蝟呆衡陽附近之渝軍，同時正準備次期作戰。　自五月二十七日開始湖南方面作戰以來，迄八月八日衡陽陷落止，所收獲之主要戰果如次：（渝軍損失）遺棄屍體六萬六千四百六十八具，被俘二萬七千四百四十七名，日軍鹵獲品計各種大砲三百三十五門，重報機關機一千七百零五挺，步槍一萬三千六百六十六支，擊洛擎毀及焚燒飛機共計八百六十九架。（日方損失）戰死五千三百四十三名。</p>
<p>丰陽附近發生激戰</p>
<p>湖南前終十四日中央社電　衡陽要衝之爭奪戰，渝軍雖受嚴命死守，然自日軍開始總攻後，時僅四日，即告陷落。且渝第十軍方先覺部下完全投降，城內治安漸告恢復，渝軍為挽回頹勢，猶企阿克復衡陽，於該市四郊盲目進攻，日軍隨時加以一痛擊，現在各地展開殲滅戰。未陽方面之日軍，十二日由小水舖南方向樟術下（來陽西北七公里）前進。瀏陽方面之日軍主力確保社港市（瀏陽北方廿五公里，）古港市（瀏陽東南廿公里）及永安各市，並掃蕩四郊殘敗渝軍。劉陽方面之日軍機械部隊，由新市西側南進，十一日晨抵達長安站，其中一部於十一日晨迅速通過托壩（長安站南方廿五公里，）目下仍在前進中。</p>
<p>湖南前綫十四日中央社電　未陽力面之日軍，自八月初旬來，對績向該方面北上之渝軍有力部隊，不斷加以包圍。九日開始殲減戰，隨地掃蕩潰亂之渝軍部隊。按該方面之渝軍為第廿六年之第四十一師，暫編第四十八師，於由未陽南方八公里之小木舖附近向衡陽北上途中，遭日軍之三面包圍。日眾中央部隊，更以夜襲突擊渝軍正面之主力第四十一師司令部，獲偉大之戰榮，因此渝軍全部陷於混亂狀態中，並誤認由右實方面救援之渝軍暫編第四十八師為日軍，以猛烈之砲火向之射擊，故其大半陷於潰滅。由於附近日軍之猛攻，現殲減戰己達最高潮。</p>
<p>渝方內部極度恐慌</p>
<p>中央社訊　自日軍攻陷衡陽後，渝政權業於九日含糊承認陷落。頃據可靠方面消息，關於該次戰策中，渝方內部已呈現恐慌局面。並於九日夜，渝軍政變方均召開緊急會議，同時為「鎭定」民心起見，渝「中央政治委員會」特通過改革地方政治議案六項。此外渝「軍事委員會」尤大施宣傳稱，調集大軍馳援，然在湘贛之渝軍政機構，狼狽異常，已作準備之撤退。渝方宣傳高呼反攻衡陽，但渝軍士氣衰落，已喪失「抗戰」力量，几地方政府又呈現恐慌局面，無法應付殘局，故渝方之所謂恢復衡陽，已無人相當能成為事實。尤其對衡陽之陷落，又有人深信渝方無法繼續「抗戰，」因在日渝戰事之決戰上，乃決於衡陽之大會戰，同時蔣介石對於該點，會在　山舉行之軍事會議上，也提出此項主張。本年七月七日蔣之廣播，決定死守衡陽，如今蔣之主張，在事實上頗為明顯，故衡陽陷落，對蔣之信仰莫不大受影響</p>

<p>東京十四日中央社電　日木基督教聯合會，頃為對美國玩弄日木頭蓋骨之行為加以勸誡，特於日木天主公教本部，召集日本基督教團，天主公教團首腦，舉行堅急臨時委員會，擬定決議文，要請美國基督教徒本宗教之立塲，從速請求有效措置。</p>
<h3 id="c7">各地日軍戰况 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　日軍在各地戰綫之戰况如次：</p>
<p>中國戰綫</p>
<p>甲，衡陽地區，日軍於八月完全攻佔衡陽後，即確保該方面之戰略要綫，對衡陽一帶之渝軍第七十四·第七十九，第一百·第六十二·第三十七各一軍（總計十師），最近開抵前綫增援之第四十六軍主力及機械化部隊，展開殲滅戰，並着着準備未來之攻勢。乙，浙江東部地區茶陵正面渝軍，係前第一百五十師，安仁正面渝軍則為一百三十三師，該方面戰爭無大變化，日軍今仍在推進擎滅戰巾。丙，未陽正面地區日軍，在未陽南方十八公里地點，刻正對渝第二十六·第九十九兩軍之一部展開擊滅戰中，目下該方面戰况，於日軍有利。渝軍暫編第二軍，曾企圖奮回來陽城，進攻該城附近·但於七·八兩日，在　陽城及其北方地區已被日軍擊滅。丁，雷州半島方面日軍，對雷州半島渝軍發動攻勢，於四日攻略廉江，復對據守信墟及安舖（遂溪西北方二十三公里）之渝軍，發動攻擊，予以重創，於是日軍乃得進擊雷州半島九州江南岸地區，而對該半島推進制　態勢。</p>
<p>緬甸前綫</p>
<p>該方面因渝軍反攻激烈，全綫戰况異常激烈，尤以怒江正面爲最，日軍士氣極昂，與優勢之渝軍對峙，刻仍交戰中。甲，怒江正面拉孟日軍，綱續與優勢之渝軍交戰，施行猛攻，日軍之受重創者，仍奮戰不休，連日書夜迎擊反復來製之渝軍，未離陣地一步。自六日迄九日之戰鬥中，使渝軍陣亡六百六十一具，鹵獲步槍子彈一萬餘發，日軍陣亡三十七名。　越方面之優勞渝軍，九日晨於戰鬥轟炸機十餘架掩護下，一齊來襲，日軍當將之誘至二十或五十米之近距離，相互對峙，九日夜半猛然逆襲，即將渝軍擊潰。又九日一部渝軍會突入城中，然大部被殲滅。</p>
<p>新幾內亞</p>
<p>戰綫，該方面日空軍，曾於十二日上午二時至四時之間，反復轟炸必阿克島對岸之奧威島，於敵陣高射砲及戰鬥機猛射中，突入敵機塲，炸毀其大型機十二架及機塲設施八處，瞭見敵機塲發生大火，料日軍已獲甚大戰果。</p>
<h3 id="c8">被俘美士官述　桂林空軍配備　渝美空軍濫炸平民 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>湖南前綫十四日中央社電　美軍第十四航空隊上士瓦特（二十一歲）於七月二十六日夜半，偕其戰友五名，自桂林出發，共驚運輸機滿載軍需品，赴衡陽接濟薛岳軍。途經零陵，為日軍陸上機槍射中，機件損毀，該上士當以降落傘着陸二至着陸地點適為日軍佔領地，該上十竟誤認日軍兵士為渝軍，高喊「我是美國人」「我是美國人」遂為日軍俘虜。該上士生於美國依阿華州，十九歲時，以志願兵入伍後，即配屬於桂林威廉　遜上校揮下之輸送隊中（約二百人，）曾運輸汽油往返昆明，運送郵件等。又據該上士供述目下桂林尚有B40型機二十五架，P35型機十五架，P24型機七架，運輸機兩架，共計五十三架。駕駛員約六十名，陸上整備部隊約五六百名，軍官約二百五十名。軍官大多過紳十生活，十官則大牛為無賴漢。</p>
<p>中央社訊　據可靠方面消息稱，關於敵美駐渝空軍，為拖飾戰敗責任，連日在非軍事區域，漫無目標作游擊式之襲擊，各地民衆損害慘重，而日軍則損失非常輕徽。同時日軍與各地民衆有密切合作，在防空設備上，更有萬全之對策，以是渝美空軍之盲目襲擊和平區，反而引起中國民衆之惡感。此外渝政權對美在渝空軍之該項空中游擊戰，實認為　無眞正之價值，並徒然担負此蹂躪民衆生命財產之責任，故蔣介石曾迭與駐渝美空軍司令長官談判，今後凡在渝美空軍　炸中國內部任何區域，須獲得軍事委員會委員長之許可，否則不得　意無的放矢，濫殺平民。由此以觀，渝政權之最近轉變，實已觀及渝美空軍之力量如此。</p>
<p>日軍空襲梁山柳州</p>
<p>大陸幕地十四日中央社電　日空軍會於十二日以戰鬥轟炸聯合編隊，攻擊梁山，炸毀渝大型機五架，小型機六架，並至柳州炸毀大型機五架，小型機六架，日機全部返防。</p>
<p>美軍非法襲擊日機</p>
<p>中國前綫某基地十四日中央社電　日傷兵運輸機一架，機身著有　明之紅十字標識，　載傷兵數名，於歸還基地時，與美機十架遭遇。當時日機手無寸鐵，遭受敵襲後，瞬爲猛烈炸　包圍，乃承　迴避，並使美機一架跌落揚子江中。最後並猛然以機身　毀其他敵機一架後，亦行自炸。</p>
<p>日機襲擊桂林擊塲</p>
<p>十×日軍×地甚四日中央社電日轟炸機隊會於十四日黎明，猛　桂林擊塲，在熾烈之防空砲火中，炸毀渝大型機三架，小型機一架，及機塲設施一處，日機則全部安反基地云。</p>

<p>蚌埠十四日中央社電　鳳陽縣所屬各區收集廢金屬，刻已全部呈送到縣，總數遽二萬三千斤。</p>
<h3 id="c10">日政府決定設置　海上運輸協議會　以運通大臣任該會議長 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>

<h3 id="c11">效法日耐苦精神　德厲行總力動員　此舉可左右日耳曼族運命 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>柏林十四日中央社電　德國現正實施第二次國民總動員，其成否實可左右德國人民之命運，是以全德人皆有絞出最後一滴血之決心，其認價力行之態度，已為當前急務。為阻止蘇軍之攻勢，全國各地均厲行總動員，東普魯士等直接受蘇軍威脅之地區，更覺雷　風行。八月二日以來，全德人民不分老幼男女，一致在國社黨政治指導員之指揮下，晝夜從公，參加人數約在十萬以上，僅黨指導員即有數千，可見其防衛國境工作之積極。此等後方勇士包括自十四五歲之希特勒靑年團及六十餘歲之老人，至其職業則農工以迄大學教授，最有趣者為一退職之年老少將，並隱其身份參加工作，嗣後軍方徵調令下，人始知其為一將軍也。</p>
<p>生存戰爭　均衡負擔</p>
<p>又東綫一帶，此等後方勇士搶割新麥移儲內地，明年度食糧實不成問題，此恰與當年德軍侵入蘇聯時，蘇聯國內總動員之景况相似，表示蘇聯人民所能者，德人亦無不能。刻下德國人民，均高呼團結，國民總力打倒蘇聯。關於總動員計劃，每日均有公布發表，觀乎郭培爾氏之佈告，即可次第明瞭其全貌。郭氏之本心，不僅在澈底勞力與兵力之動員，乃均衡國民對於戰爭之負擔，使戰爭之名實，為全國人民之戰爭，以求加強同仇敵愾之心。此次之總動員措置，實可目為精神總動員，其體制組織緊密無間，但因德人個人意識堅強，故關於維持各個人生活問題，政府當加以考慮，是故學習日本國民忍耐精神之論調，最近頗為激昂。</p>
<p>利用勞力　國無閱人</p>
<p>德報十二日載稱，積年奮鬥以至於今，基於時局之需要，個人生活應極度　節，刻下具體方策之最惹人注目者，爲官應裁員，擁有八十萬勞動員之鐵道部及興此不相上下之財政部均大施裁員，此外更可注意者，爲家庭工業之日趨有組織化，此舉且可使工塲化整為零。對於吸收前此認為不堪使用而放之勞動力人員，負起極大任務，其對象為五十歲以上無勞動義務之婦人。懷抱乳兒之婦人。以及老弱不能於工塲工作等，可於家庭中緩綏工作，從此德國除兒童外，更無一閒人，此種利用剩餘人力計劃之實行，實總力戰之典型，可永垂不朽者云。</p>

<p>德</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰時，德國體驗了四年的俄戰禍，故在此次戰爭中，爲謀短期內結束戰爭起見，採用所謂閃電戰法，但對於長期戰爭，也並非毫無準備，在巡得最後勝利前，或許要遭遇非常的困難，此層早已考慮及之，故致力於長期戰的準備。國社黨政府的糧食自給自足政策，即其一例。</p>
<p>開戰迄今，已歷四年又十個月，其間國民傾整個生活以奉獻戰爭。戰爭時期，有燈火管制，食糧及衣服的計口配給制，旅行限制等種種生活上的不自由，而遭受種種累煩的限制。但至今日，這種不自由已經習慣，而視為當然。而且自去年開始，敵人向各都市不分皂白宣行殘忍的轟炸以來，今日後方與前錢毫無區別，十足的成為戰塲。</p>
<p>另一方面，去年以來，德方迎着優勢的敵軍攻勢，在前錢繼續苦戰，過去一年間，雖在敵方猛烈的空襲下過活，前綫不利的消息，紛至沓來，但德國國民仍然堅毅忍耐，毫不沮喪，實令人為之驚異。此種從容不迫的精神，就是必勝的信念絕未動搖的證據。而必勝信念的所以不動搖，不得不歸功於國社黨政府施策的成功。</p>
<p>國社黨政府去年鑒於危機來臨，乃以克服危機為當前急務，第一是強化宣傳力量，宣傳部長郭培爾每星期在「德意志周刋」上撰文一篇，數年來成為定例，論文中曉渝國人以祖國危機來臨，對於危機的由來，危機的性質，詳細論述，使國民了解事態，並諄諄曉渝國民德國乃為正義而戰，國民聆悉之餘，在精神上大見振作。</p>
<p>第二是娛樂的提供和食糧對策。空製剛過，政府從事糧食的供給急於一切，並努力使電影院和音樂會重開。避免糧食不足，乃為遂行戰爭的基木前提，要腹與國民的十氣有密切的關係。空襲之後，非常糧食的供給，極為圓滿，這對於安定民心，厥功最偉。</p>
<p>第三是嚴罰主義。國家臨此危機時，不許國民非法份子的存在，句有此種份子存在，就加以澈底的殲滅，以振作國民的士氣。</p>
<p>加以國民對於希特勤元首，絕對信賴，此與必勝的信念有不可分離的關係，無待贅言。規在德國佇立於存亡絕績的歧路，但國社黨指導部領導下的國民，都有盡人事以待天命的自覺，出全力以赴戰，前綫兵十及後方國民，士氣旺盛，殆由於此。</p>
<p>英</p>
<p>德國的轟炸機從基地出發，歷三四十分鐘，就可以在倫敦上空投擲炸彈，不僅如此，號稱鐵壁的法國馬奇諾防棧，不久即被攻拔，德國陸空軍的精銳部隊如怒濤一般的進迫法國北部沿海一帶，等待着命令，準備渡越僅隔二十至三十海里的狹窄的英法海峽，向英國木土登陸。這是一九四○年春季到秋季的英國木國，首都倫敦成為戰場，敵方大砲所到達的第一綫。</p>
<p>寬闊的汽車公路，到處堆積着舊汽車和材料，準備阻塞敵方的戰車，降落傘部隊所可到達的廣塲，都插着尖的鐵桿，六十歲的老經理也編入民團，拿起搶桿受訓練。到了夜裹，他們掛了小槍，各自在他們的公司和事務所門前站崗；不僅老人如此，家庭的主婦們，也學製手榴彈，練習向德戰車投擲的方法。</p>
<p>局勢雖是如此緊張，但另一方面倫敦市民的生活，還是很滑稽地保持平常狀態。戲院裹照舊客滿，酒館裏人頭擠擠，在濛濛的紫烟裘，高談闊論，直至深夜。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>一九四一年六月二十二日，德軍突然從舊波蘭邊境，向蘇聯開始攻擊，自彼時起，莫斯科染上了戰時的顏色，立即宣佈戒嚴令，市內各處張貼起防空令的細則。</p>
<p>午後八時起，實施嚴格的燈火管制，夜間外出，拍照攝影，店舖餐館的營業時問，都受限制，莫斯科除固定的居民外，禁止其他人入市，市民肩上背翁防空面罩，片刻不離</p>
<p>防空活動與治安維持，以區為單位，自十六歲至六十歲的男子，十八歲至五十歲的女子，強制實行動員，以二三百人為一隊，組織自衛團，擔任傳達命令，消防，將藥衛生等任務，無論有無警報，每晚輪流通宵站崗，但自一九四二年冬季以來，各種的限制大部份都緩和了。譯七月八日每日新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c19">華北各地煤炭　蘊藏量豐富　已分別品質儘量利用 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>東京十四日中央社電　大柬亞各地所產之煤炭，其功用可使鐵鑛石成為戰爭上不可缺乏之鋼鐵，而直接化為戰力，不僅可為製鐵之用，同時亦可謂為重工業及化學工業上不可缺少之基礎資源，時至今日，日木國內各地如北海道·　太·九州乃至大東亞共榮圈內各地域及中國華北·蒙疆·華中·南洋·滿洲各地，其所產煤炭，今已全部轉向上述之各重要用途，着着化為戰力。</p>
<p>大東亞之煤炭資源</p>
<p>關於大東亞共榮圈之煤炭資源，其最足令吾人注視者，首推華北方面之煤炭，蓋華北之媒炭，在量方面，實可謂為無盡藏，在質方面又屬優良，其在種類上亦甚繁多，現各種煤炭，均已分別按其品貿而用之於有效之途，藉以盡量活用，總之，足以完全化為戰力，是以資源之耍，實無過於煤炭矣。口華北之煤炭，更可以種種方法，使之分類，根據專家之分類方法，煤炭可分為有烟煤與無烟煤，若從其性質上觀之，有烟煤又可分為結結煤與弱粘煤，更從其用途上述說，粘結煤即為製鐵用煤，非粘結煤即為燃料煤，無烟煤則為工業用與家庭用之煤炭。華北煤炭埋藏量之多寡，依專家估計而異，茲姑假定其埋藏量共為一千三百萬萬噸，平均一年採掘一萬噸，則其量數當可支持一千三百年之採掘，若以每年採掘五千萬噸計，則其採掘年限將為二千六百年矣。</p>
<p>分別用途化爲戰力</p>
<p>茲再根據上述在用途上之分類，進而分析華北方面之豐富煤炭如次，此種分析目的，不外在求華北煤炭之化為戰力，　裂鐵用煤，此種煤炭，當以粘度高，硝黃質及灰分少為條件，其最為適合此種條件者，首推開　·井陘·中尖·大汶口及六河溝各地煤鑛所產之煤炭。此等煤炭在性質上均屬強粘結煤，此若與日木各地所產之粘結炭配合，則將更可使其粘結程度提高，而可生產優良之骸炭。　工業用煤，在輕重化學工業中所需用之煤炭，其生產自近年來已益見增大，成爲華北煤炭汽車所必需之資源，此等工業用煤，在性質上均屬無烟煤，以陽泉·門頭溝·憑心及焦作等地之煤鑛所產者為最優良。就中尤以河南省焦作產煤為最，近在化學工業用途上，尤足重視，本年五月已確認其埋藏量為從來估計量之十倍。　燃料用煤，此處所謂燃料用煤，乃指煮沸器用而言，華北大部煤炭均屬於煮沸器用者，其中最稱優良者，為大同方而所產之煤炭，而華北所產之煮沸用煤，在華中尤其上海方面工塲中，需要　為綦切。</p>

<p>仰光十四日中央社電　緬旬特別調查團團長巴事博士一行，業於緬甸獨立一週年紀念日歸抵仰光，特別調查團雖僅以百日之短少時間，而獲有極大收穫，博士現正埋頭整理三月來調查之收獲，日木及其他大東亞各盟邦之戰時姿態。巴亭博士返抵仰光後，首次接見記者，發表談話，大意如次：戰時物資缺乏，乃當然現象，但日本國民皆不顧困窘，為完逐戰爭，忍受一切，如目前日本政府之諸施策，完全立足於戰爭完遂之道，國民之最低生活亦得確保，同時，重工業生產無不顯示躍進，各鑛山，工廠亦與戰塲同樣活潑生產，意志之昂揚，生產技術之進步，實出吾人　料之外，故吾人亦不禁湧起與日木共同奮鬥，共同建設，共同完遂戰爭之鬥志。緬甸拋除一切舊英美之束縛，爲恢復大東亞民族本來面目，當此獨立一週年之始，益形進人本格之建設戰，此次調查所得，確信將為緬甸建設之一種推動力。緬甸重工業生產，曩於英國統制下，向無發展之餘地，深感非採取日木生產方式及新興滿洲國之方式中不為功，統制物價絕非通貨膨脹政策，最高限價及公定價格制度，或為統制經濟之一階段。徵諸世界各國對通貨膨脹抑制之失敗，吾人似應倣效日本隣親配合制度，為爭取勝利，吾人必須稍受不自由之限制，始得達成吾人偉大目標，非戰勝則無獨立與自由，故吾人為獲得勝利，必須實現以上新的理念。滿洲國，菲律賓，西利伯各地，均逐漸實現其理想，豈有緬甸不得成功者乎。</p>

<h3 id="c35">日美決戰的前途 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>前瑞典海軍大學教授，現任「瑞典京城日報」海軍記者艾柏格將軍，特為日本讀賣報知撰文「一九四四年七月的太平洋戰局」，內中曾指出美軍今後應採取的戰鬥，以及必要的準備和戰略，同時更指出日軍應如何進行對抗作戰。</p>
<p>尼米資得目標</p>
<p>今年二月，美國太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資曾大言不慚地說：「在最近的將來，美國大軍將在中國沿岸登陸」。這以前，麥克沃塞也會表示「收復」菲律賓的決心。這兩個人所表示的作戰目標，是有很大的出入。自從佔領重要基地塞班島以後，尼米資就說，美國在太平洋上的海空前綫基地，又更深入了一步，但塞班島這一基地，如再佔領迭尼安島，羅特島，關島後，則將擴大為鞏固而有力的基地，假設美國軍隊能佔領這些島嶼，則在西太平洋的全部海面上，可以有效地攻擊日本軍的內綫。然而尼米資所焦燥的次一個作戰目標，或許是在呂宋，台灣，琉球三處選擇一個立脚點，或者是奪取硫黃列島和小笠原羣島的空軍基地。</p>
<p>此外以塞班島為基地的美國潛水艇，常常出現於台灣附近，道當然用不着說，即中國大陸沿岸，甚至日本本土周圍，美國潛水艇也是常常神出鬼沒的。美國所以能佔領日本補充基地的塞班島者，恐怕全是依賴航空母艦載備的空軍有力掩護所致。還有一個理由，與駐華空軍相呼應配合，而參加塞班島及其他各島　基地作戰的關係。另外，美國由阿留申羣島轟炸千島，其目的在於分散日本軍隊的防衛力，而實行牽制戰，這也是可能的。</p>
<p>麥克沃塞的行動</p>
<p>麥克沃塞業巳佔領必阿克島農赫爾島的數個有力空軍基地，而現在麥克沃塞指揮下的空軍，利用該兩島及新幾內亞的基地，向加羅林羣島，帛琉軍島，南菲律賓，東部荷印，馬加撒海峽，以及斯拉巴亞等廣汎地域，進行空襲</p>
<p>麥克沃塞軍的海軍前綫基地，我認為是新幾內亞的芬港灣，和塔那麥爾灣，在該處而向維古島和馬羅塔島，進行跳躍作戰，然後再企圖佔領棉蘭著，但進攻棉蘭著的時候，必須考慮到攻擊雅浦島及帛琉羣島的尼米資艦隊之掩護。</p>
<p>印度洋戰局的影響</p>
<p>印度洋的形勢對於太平洋戰局，是有很大影響的。英國想配合美國的太平洋作戰，而有收復印度洋的木國失地及荷印之企圖，同時也在夢想恢復中印間的陸地交通綫，以及印度洋至中國大陸的海洋交通棧。此外，英國潛水艇，想要截斷在安達曼周圍和馬六甲海峽方面，日本至緬甸的海洋運輸棧。</p>
<p>在這種情形下，很有可能在安達曼羣島，尼古巴羣島，北部蘇門芥臘以及緬甸，進行登陸作戰。英國常前作戰目標的新嘉坡之最短距離，固屬是馬萊海峽，以及荷印羣島南部相連的的狹隘的水路，但因機雷。艦艇。空軍以及沿岸砲攔阻航路，所以英軍或許實行迂迴戰，經過帝摩爾再向西進，至爪哇而向北進，與麥克沃塞軍及其他美軍會師，而大舉衝向日軍佔領地區，直指新嘉坡。這就是英國的遠大計劃。</p>
<p>美軍勢力</p>
<p>美國太平洋艦隊的現勢，可以推算出來，擁有備十二門十六英寸砲的戰鬥艦十五艘，大型航空母艦十艘，小型航空母艦八艘，以及補助航空母艦約三十艘。此外當然還包括英國的遠東艦隊，如「喬治五世」號級戰鬥艦三艘，其他戰鬥艦五艘，大小航空母艦十艘以上，此外還有澳洲及新西蘭的許多艘巡洋艦。</p>
<p>前此解散了的赫爾賽南太平洋艦隊，現在則於中部太平洋上構成了強而有力的機動部隊。假如，進行塞班島戰及六月十九日海戰的斯布蘭斯艦隊，能有以前那樣八艘至十艘戰艦以及約二十艘航空母艦之多的話，則前此赫爾賽艦隊亦不過如此。除了第五十八機動部隊外，尚有對付日本的三個有力艦隊，目下正在個別進行着主力作戰。此外金凱德少將所指揮的麥克沃塞所屬的小艦隊，在強大的基地空軍掩護之下，時時神出鬼沒。以上全都是令人不可忽視的事實。</p>
<p>日軍作戰方法</p>
<p>由此觀之，日本海軍在廣闊的太平洋海面上，不得不與敵人艦隊對峙著。但日本海外派的遺陸軍，除駐紮於中軍隊外，都必須受艦國隊經常的掩護。日本本土和合灣，固屬是有關日本民族生死存亡的重要地，但日本的南洋交通綫受到嚴重國協的今天，就決不能忽視南中國海及印度洋。日本艦隊的目前情形，除了推算外，是無法知道實際力量的，總之，目前日木的海軍不免過於分散</p>
<p>日木艦隊，是會按英美艦隊的動向不斷變化着。日軍既有這樣的艦隊力量，所以作戰方法只好把主力集中一處，實行各個擊破戰術。例如美國艦隊企圖突破合灣海峽和攻擊日本南部時，則日本福當傾全國之艦艇，與美國兩個大機動部隊之一相死拼，如是或有出頭。</p>
<p>誰都不能否認，戰爭愈長久，則美國海軍建造軍艦愈多，因而戰力愈會加強。「時間」固然對日本有利，但對美國也同樣有利，這一點是應當知道的。（魯譯自七月二十一日讀賣報知）</p>

<h3 id="c45">迫切需要整頓稅收 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>關於消費特稅舞弊一案，日前財政局袁局長已有談話發表，正在嚴密偵查。與論界亦多所論列，促起注意。我們以圩本市財政的整理，尤其稅收的整頓，曾一再獻言。我們希望財政健全以後，對於服務公職的員警待遇，可以增加，使能維持最低限度的生活以後，才能切實談到行政效率。</p>
<p>這次稅收舞弊案的揭發，更足證明本市稅收的弱點與破綻，實有迫切整頓的必要。我們希望市政當局對於舞弊案件，秉公澈查，不受任何牽制，務使罪責判明，大白社會。同時，視這次案件是一個嚴重的教訓，是一個痛苦的經驗，而對於今後一切稅收，無論在制度方面，機構方面，尤其是人事方面，均應有澈底的革新，切實的整頓。日前袁局長表示消費特稅，計劃成一獨立機構，另聘社會知名之士，對稅務有經驗者主持其事。我們盼能實現。如果因循瞻顧，對於目前的舞弊案件不了了之，對於今後的財政整理沿襲如故，那末，後患之來，將更甚於今日的舞弊案件，一切大上海建設計劃終將歸於泡影，這是我們很迫切的提供市政當局應加注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c46">禁止深夜叫賣 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>近來本市一般用電，再加嚴格限制，一方面固然是煤廳來源的困難，一方面也是實踐戰時生活應有的措施。所謂戰時生活的內容，約言之，就是生産要緊張，消費要節約。所以，一切不節約的消費，就是違背戰時生活。</p>
<p>其次，我們說過，上海是後方重要都市，敵機空襲，原是意料中極可能的事。所以，防空是每個市民的責任，也是每個市民爲自身安全所奉行的事。</p>
<p>所以，對於違背戰時生活，對於違背防空的事物，不伭鉅細，都應加以改革。試舉一個很小的例，譬如晚間或深夜之時，本市馬路上常有食物小販，沿　歷來習慣，市場喊賣，或擊物傳聲呌賣。第一，深夜呌喊，妨碍大衆安眠，足以吳市吹簫翌日的辦事精力。第二，所賣食物，大都屬於初小文化消閒，供給一般不務正業者消耗，違背節約，且食之無益，反碍衛生。第三，食物擔上既有燈光，且高聲呌喊，對於防空頗有妨碍。希望警務當局加以注意，對此深夜呌賣者，考慮有無禁止必要。這是一例，凡不合戰時需要，不問其歷史的習慣如何，應加取締的。</p>

<h3 id="c54">經濟犯罪的動向 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 定塜道雄</p>
<p>經濟犯罪，是經濟統制法秩序和刑罰間，具有關聯的方面發生的火星。經濟犯罪理論方面的經濟刑法，不外是從刑罰的表面上看到的經濟統制法。所以脫離經濟統制法，而想知道經濟犯罪的動向，是自然不可能的。</p>
<p>統制的進行</p>
<p>日本的經濟統制法秩序，固然一般人說是適應七七事變的演進，而發展出來的，然而事實上，是遠在九一八事變時業已開始進行了。當在我們的父兄以頭頗和鮮血換來的，永久不能忘記的新得土地上，大日本民族在經濟方面將成爲失敗者而被　驅逐出來的時候，而日本人沸騰起愛國的滿腔熱血，冒險公然奮起，發動大事變，而今日的日本才有新的出發點。經濟統制法的淵源，也就是發手此。凡想到經濟統制的秩序者，都必須清楚地認識這一發乎愛國熱情的舉動。日本經濟統制法的精神，必須認爲這是有關國家大事，應當衷心接受的。所以應當認爲這是日本特殊的法律，而加以展開，老實說，經濟統制法不外是今日和明日促成日本法典的東西，但既然是自始至終如此貫澈著國體精神，所以內裏深藏著不中理解者，就是這個關係。</p>
<p>這樣發展出來的經濟統制法，是爲了日本民族，所以必須是強力的。因此　有刑罰幫助，同時求助於刑罰，這已經　成爲一個特質了。稱作犯罪，而就會引人注意，就是這個道理。一九三八年時，輸出人品等按臨時揹置法所規定的價格，漸有三二擴大的傾向，於一九三九年，由於國家總動員法的發動，而進入價格等統制令時代，於是價格統制，總是求嚴格的刑罰幫助，且具有不可動搖的支配力。在這一價格統制時代，經濟犯罪與經濟刑法，很富於戲劇性而出現，所以一切人都注意於些。</p>
<p>一九三八年至一九四一年　反價格的盛行時代，是這樣産生的。然而價格統制，正像對於大的經濟河流，想在向下流處任意用刑罰堤　加以阻止，這實在是不可能的事。所以河水就越過這一堤壩，而向海奔流，這是防不勝防的。這就是　犯價格的現象。</p>
<p>統制物資配給</p>
<p>爲完成價格統費，和　救盛行　犯價格善，則單純平抑物價是不妥當的，而必須統費物資本身的移動。因此，就必須統制物資配給。於是與價格統制並駕齊驅，而産生配給統制。這就是根據在向下流處築成的刑罰堤壩，是不能阻撓河水下流的，只有把水流本身，遷移到另一水道雲，於是才産生配給的思想。爲物資這親水流，要製造一定的配給水道，凡不經正當水道而行者，決定認爲這是　犯配給而將加以處罰，即想對於配給路線本身，用刑罰來加強的。所以便對著物資水源，逐漸花費很多工夫，而作成配給水道。憑票配給制，也是按列水量在配給機構中所産生的副産物。</p>
<p>統制就是統制。一個物資的價格統制，就是稱作其他物資的價格統制，而價格統制本身，就是稱作配給統制的。</p>
<p>然而這種週到而的配給機構建立起來後，正如河水流入一定道路而建造有組織的壩一樣，於是就自然成爲一個系統，而出現一個經濟組織。統制尚未及於經濟組織前的價格統制，以及物資統制，是爲使不超過法定價格而締結買賣契約行爲的一種統制，是爲使不達法而交換物資行爲的一種統制。這是一種行爲統制法，即是經濟行爲法。後又不久，經濟組織本身也加以統制了。於是對於受統制的經濟組織，就有必要用刑罰來保護它。因此由於發生必要保護，就必須攷慮到經濟組織上的刑法保護，因爲是適應以保護行爲爲目的國家總動員法第三十一條，以及輸出人品等臨時措置法第五條的刑法規定。這就是爲維持經濟法秩序的經濟刑法，亦即是關於經濟方面的瀆職罪，經濟秘密揩油罪。這一切都以經濟組織法的存在爲前提，而採取強力保護的立場。</p>
<p>兩種經濟犯罪</p>
<p>所以經濟犯罪中可以化分爲兩種，一種就是違犯平價，違犯配給之類的破壞經濟行爲秩序的犯罪，另一種就是統制會職員和營團職員收受賄賂而破壞經濟組織的犯罪。經濟統制法秩序中志願許爲法秩序的犯罪，今後當然也不會絕跡的，但以前這種犯罪非常的多。至於後者，即違背經濟組織法秩序的犯罪，是今後一定曾不斷發生的一種犯罪。</p>
<p>目前的經濟犯罪動向，是由經濟行爲法違反罪，轉向經濟組織法違反罪的，經濟刑法的重心，逐漸轉移了。凡是准許存在的一切企業，歸根結底不外是有補於戰力增強，最有社會性和國家性；就是要求各個企業，放棄營利性，去掉對資本的從屬性，而應按惟一的生産目的運營。這種企業的國家性，在經濟刑法世界裏，將是縣長瀆職罪滸的可能根據。當企業被營利性和對資本的絕對從屬性所支配的數年前，經濟瀆職罪尚不能發生，且也不能助長。</p>
<p>處於今日，新　兩種經濟犯罪非常的多，且到處滸，而險惡化了。知道這種情形的人，是否能撲滅這種犯罪，誠屬穎難問。然而我們日本，由大正末年至昭和五六年（一九三〇年），那種澎湃洶湧如火如荼的思想犯罪，是怎樣年來了的呢？這是值得回憶的。思想犯罪的對象共産黨員，舊經濟犯罪的對象中小商工業者，以及新經濟犯罪的對象經濟界指導者，全都是相信經濟法則的，全都是相信經濟必然性的，就是說，思想基礎是相同的。但在日本的思想犯，終於能夠理解精神勝過物質，國體勝過資本的事實了。</p>
<p>對於經濟犯罪，主要是理解國體思想，。而代表天皇執行裁判的法官，以及檢察官和警官，要堅強也把握住忠誠心，以證實國體思想存在的精神，來應付這種犯罪。沒有強烈認識的經濟犯，是只知滿足欲望追求物質，而不知有其他。比思想犯來說，反容易使其早已潛伏的忠誠心再醒轉來。</p>
<p>新經濟刑法</p>
<p>以統制會和營團的職員爲對象的新經濟刑法，在經濟關係懲罰條例中充分表現出來，但這一法律的精神，不僅單純判斷統制會和營團職員的收受賄賂爲非法，同時也應當知道，這是要求統制關係官　公務員的清廉。此外，國內政治和統制必須按戰時指導的現狀，指導者從然是軍人，也知心朋友求其絕對清廉。現在軍人不僅在前線，而且在國內後方，當指導日常經濟行爲時，知心朋友具體表示出來，自己是堅信國體思想的忠誠愛國者，這就是爭取勝利的方法。「只有內部勝而才勝」，這是經過千年攷驗的國體思想，對於僅有二三百年迷信史的經濟思想，一定會粉碎無遠的。（作者爲東瀛地方裁判所豫審判事）（安譯自七月九日讀賣報知）</p>
<h3 id="c55">助學金辦事處　工作報告 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>本報讀者助學金之各項辦法，由委員會議決，辦事處執行。辦事處之工作隨時向委員會報告。惟助學事業發端於社會各界人士之熱忱，委員會與辦事處俱對社會負責。茲值第七屆攷試辦理守竣之際，爰將半年來工作之大要，及本屆考選學生之經過，向各界關心人士報告如左：</p>
<p>學校之調查參觀及訪問</p>
<p>辦事處爲明瞭本市學校情形，並與各校取得聯絡起見，於本年三月間發出學校概況調查表，請各校填寫，四五月間實行參觀及訪問。調查表經各校填寫寄回者共計五八八張，除極少數情形特殊之學校，也本報助學金尚未發生關係者外，全市各級學校可謂全已包羅在內。茲交各種學校及學生數目表列於後，以供關心教育者之參考：</p>
<p>學校種類　學校總數　學生總數</p>
<p>小學　四二二　一六七五七二</p>
<p>初中及初級職業學校　一九九　三八八四八</p>
<p>高中及專科學校　一二七　一七六二九</p>
<p>大學及專科學校　三四　一二七六三</p>
<p>補習學校　四　七三八五</p>
<p>總計　七八七　二四四一九二</p>
<p>此處各種學校總數爲七八七，較五八八多一九九，蓋有一三一校同時歸入二類（如初高中同時計入初中及高中），有三十四校同時歸入三類（如初高中有附設小學者），惟學生人數則分別列入各類，並無重複。</p>
<p>至於參觀及訪問，因限於時間，未能普遍，下學期尚需繼續進行。惟對於已到各校所得具體印像，及與學校當局晤談之結果，頗有足供辦理助學事業之參考者。</p>
<p>受助學生之輔導</p>
<p>上學期中所辦輔導工作，約有以下數端：一·在四五月間實行參觀及訪問學校之際，曾在各校召集中學生之受助者談話，學校人數較多者一校單獨舉行，人數較少者二三校全併舉行。受助學生因之更不忘社會人士冀望之殷，益知奮勉。所談學習之經濟方法，對於其自修當亦不無裨益。一部份學生曾發表意見，亦有參考之價值。二·一月十四蟲國與本報社會服務處合辦高中以上學生職業指導演講，到會指導者有裴雲卿·潘仰曉·許元芳·黃希聞·陸梅僧·陳齊士諸先生。三·星期學術演講，自五月二十八日至七月三十日，共舉行十次。講師爲傅毓光·許元芳·　俊良·王成組·徐鳳·石趙富鑫·陳青士·江振聲·方子衡諸先生。講題關於·哲學物理·化學·生物·心理·地理·工程·工業等學科。地點則分新閘路小學·惠中中學·及中國科學社三處。凡高中以上受助學生各就對於講題興趣及時地之便利選擇聽講，每人至少聽講二次，繳筆記一篇。每次聽講人數自一百（限於坐位）至三百不等。四·六月間舉行初中及高小受助學生實用書法競賽，鍋筆與毛筆，行書與正楷，不加限制，惟分別證券。初選合格者於六月二十七日在本館複賽，兼重速度。結果有十五人獲甲等獎，三十二人獲乙等獎。</p>
<p>本屆考選學生之經過</p>
<p>本屆考選學生之辦法與曆屆略有不同。申請者須先經學校審查資格，非經學校認爲清寒優秀者不發給申請書。各學當局對每一申請學生必須填寫推寫書。辦事處收到申請書與推寫書後，再加審查，淘汰其成績較差或家境尚可者，其餘分組編號，予以登記，本屆登記人數統計如下：</p>
<p>高小　一八三二人　初中　二九七四人</p>
<p>高中　一二七四人　大學專科　八五七人</p>
<p>統計　六九三七人</p>
<p>觀測驗之利益有二：一爲批分可以絕對公允，不至受閱卷者個人好惡及心理變化之影響，答案之正誤，有一定之標凖，不論任何人在任何時間之批分結果俱屬相等，此在大規模考試，必需在短期間批閱數千份試卷者，尤爲必要。一爲作答時間減至最短限度，試題數目可以增多，老生不至因偶然對於少數題材之熟悉或疏忽而定其成敗。據試驗結果，此種客觀測驗一場，其可靠程度與普通考試六七場之結果不相上下。本屆測驗之試題分配如下：</p>
<p>高小及　初中　高中</p>
<p>初中一　二三年　及大一</p>
<p>文問讀理解　二十題　三十題　二十題</p>
<p>字羨　二十題　二十題　二十題</p>
<p>用字　二十題　——　——</p>
<p>文學常識　——　　　　——　　　二十題</p>
<p>自然科學　二十題　二十題　四十題</p>
<p>外國語字義　——　二十題　　二十題</p>
<p>翻譯　——　　十題　十題</p>
<p>填字　——　——　二十題</p>
<p>算學　十六題　十二題　十六題</p>
<p>總計題數　一一六　一二二　二二六</p>
<p>測驗時間　二小時　二小時　二時半</p>
<p>各種試題方式大半用選擇式，每題備有四個或三個答案，考生祇需選擇其一，略舉數例如下</p>
<p>齷齪　是　1不清靜　2不清潔　3不寬大　4不好聽</p>
<p>這花又香（1又　2　也　3　更　4且）好看</p>
<p>北宋一朝的大患　是　1　宦官專權　2　武人跋扈　3　外族入寇</p>
<p>黃河潰決肇禍之處每在　1洛陽一帶　2開封一帶　3濟南一帶</p>
<p>腎髒是　1消化器　2排泄器　3循環器</p>
<p>三斤之力與四斤之力任用於一點，其合力可能爲　1零斤　2五斤　3十二斤</p>
<p>Teacher　是　1聽者　2教師　3鄰人</p>
<p>試題中間有採用選配式者，以四爲一組，每組備有六個答案，每題選擇其一，舉例如下：</p>
<p>視人國若其國，誰攻？人之性惡，其善者僞也。君子喻於義，小人喻於利。窮鈎者誅，窮國者爲諸候。　　1見論語　　2見中庸　　3見孟子　　4見墨子　　5見荘子　　6見荀子</p>
<p>引種測驗頗能辨別學生學業之優劣，除學校功課以外，課外之閱讀及經歷亦頗有關係。如以測驗結果與在校成績比較，頗能互相證實。茲以高小一年級組測驗前列五名學生之學校推　書上成績總評錄後，以見一斑：</p>
<p>顧致偉　振英小學三十七人中第二名</p>
<p>朱磁賓　滙師小學七十四人中第一名</p>
<p>餘德磐　潤德小學五十三人中第一名</p>
<p>沈福星　武定小學七十二人中第三名</p>
<p>謝寶玉　聖心小學四十五人中第一名</p>
<p>至於核准人數這決定，不得不顧及捐款數目，量入爲出，選擇測驗成績特別優秀者。其不能核准之學生，並非成績不能及格，祇　是限於捐款，愛莫能助。同樣，每生補助之金額，亦不得不參照捐款，加以限制，除少數學校收費特低者外，大抵僅足學雜費之五六成，殊爲遺憾。現在高小及初中核准學生之名單已經發表，人數及預算如下：</p>
<p>高小　一千二百人預算二百四十萬元</p>
<p>初中　一千五百人預算四百五十萬元</p>
<p>合計　二千七百人預算六百九十萬元</p>
<p>高中及大學專科之名單尚未發表，照目下捐款總數，預算僅可核准八百人。如日內捐款激增，則核准人數尚可增加，是則希望於社會各界人士之最後熱忱者也。</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪　洋譯</p>
<p>「你怎樣知道車到時間的？」</p>
<p>隆夫很吃驚地望著妹妹，但六年來未見的妹妹的面貌和身體，完全長大成人了，這更使他驚訝不置。</p>
<p>「是真人拍電報來通知的……」</p>
<p>「呵，原來如此呀！」</p>
<p>隆夫心中想，坐早晨快車的事情，固然會告訴了真人，但他通知了家庭，這真是令人感激不盡的。</p>
<p>「爸爸還生我氣麽？」</p>
<p>這是從西車站坐上電車時，隆夫向妹妹突然發問的一句話。</p>
<p>「那有這樣多心的人哪？」</p>
<p>枝小姐的聲音，非常溫存而柔和。語氣正像初婚的太太向丈夫說的一樣，深深地印在隆夫心板上了。</p>
<p>「變了……」</p>
<p>隆夫覺得奇怪，偷偷地看看妹妹的面容。稍稍燙捲的頭髮，項頸，乳白色的肩膀，卻有東京女郎的風味，但深陷的眼睛，長長的眉毛，高挺的鼻樑，輕輕閉著的嘴唇，仍然還有常地害羞的神氣。</p>
<p>（爬到樹頂上去被媽媽罵得體無完膚的這位妹妹，現在竟大變了……）</p>
<p>隆夫認為妹妹的變化，還無非是年齡作崇。</p>
<p>在半途換了車，在二中大街下車，而隆夫一地詳視看街道傍邊排列著的房舍以及商店的招牌，益發使他感到地重遊的無限腸觸。一切都和六年前無甚變化。就是現在，也覺著對面來了穿著棉布衣裳的真人，與人，萬代等。</p>
<p>一到下荒田，立刻嗅到天寶山濱吹來的海風香味。櫻島，在排列整齊的房頂上，靜靜地露著頭部。須臾間，到自己家去的大街，出現於面前。隆夫的眼睛裏熱淚迸流著，而不能眺望遠方了。</p>
<p>來到自己家門前時，枝小姐就急忙跑到屋裏去了。隆夫打開自己家門的時候，突然害羞起來了。</p>
<p>屋裏面腳步聲音，在　　　作糖。玻璃窗門很急地響了。</p>
<p>「呵，隆夫……」</p>
<p>母親含著悲痛的聲音和形影，同時出現於隆夫的面前。隆夫像罪人一樣，低下頭去，一句話也說不出來了。</p>
<p>過了一會兒，被母親催促著，隆夫走向書房。在這裏，父親還很健康地坐著。</p>
<p>「爸爸……我有罪。」</p>
<p>「不要再說了吧！」</p>
<p>父親用雙手抱著兒子，眼眶中不禁流出熱淚來。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>像夢般地，三天過去了。</p>
<p>故鄉，的確是好。故鄉的山，海，魚，枇杷，甚至鹹菜，無一不適合於隆夫的脾味。</p>
<p>父母並不責駡兒子的過去，而朋友對於受到海軍大臣賞的發家，都在有口皆碑地稱讚著。</p>
<p>「隆夫，我年老了，想不再服務於市政府，到東京去一同過吧！」</p>
<p>父親這句話是有一天早晨，兩個人對坐談笑時說的。</p>
<p>「是，那最好。」</p>
<p>隆夫並非像市來畫家那樣討厭家鄉，而是在自己職業崗位上，必須永留在東京。想到自己是為人子女時，覺著也應當盡一點孝道，侍奉父母，如全家都搬到東京去住，這是如何令人快樂的事呵！但所關心者，只是時機問題，最好自己的地位穩固後，再住在一起，常敘天倫之樂，是比較好的。</p>
<p>「再過五六年，您看怎樣？」</p>
<p>「是的，是用不著太急的。」</p>
<p>父親靜靜地彈下煙灰，接著說：</p>
<p>「還有，枝現在也大了。她已經也二十歲了。」</p>
<p>「他應當結婚了麽？」</p>
<p>「是的，我就是想等你回來談這個問題，但老實說，我是已經有意中人了。」</p>
<p>「是誰呢？」</p>
<p>「是谷家的真人君。」</p>
<p>隆夫一聽到這句話便不知不覺而發出一下驚歎聲來。</p>
<p>（為什麽我以前沒有注意到這個地方呢？）</p>
<p>他真想敲一下自己的頭腦。是再沒有比這合適的姻緣了。真人和枝妹，本來從小就認識。父親母親又總是稱讚真人和真人家的樸素門風，又加上隆夫本身非常敬愛真人這樣好的朋友。沒有想到結成這樣好的兩家姻緣者，倒莫如說他是因為兩個人始終還覺得是童年。</p>
<p>「絕對贊成，絕對贊成！」</p>
<p>隆夫這樣大的聲音，幾乎把父親嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>「那個人是沒有錯的，只是應當早一點徵求一下真人君本人的意見。」</p>
<p>「那末枝妹意見怎樣呢？」</p>
<p>「枝兒麽？枝兒麽！」</p>
<p>父親不知什麽理由，大聲笑起來了。</p>

<p>— 志竟</p>
<p>不合理的學徒制度，是被大多數人咀咒著的，我總覺得這是現社會制度所賜予的影響，它已有根深蒂固的傳統性，一時間要把它消除，是會不很大的困難，武斷地也可說是不可能，補救辦法，祗有從各方面來改善現行的學徒生活，現在提出來希望能引起大家注意：</p>
<p>掃地，倒痰盂等，在人們所認為不屑為的工作，由學徒們來幹，這是對年青人的摧殘，與埋沒志氣，這見解極其有理。可中，這鎖屑而必要工作，除了學徒們委曲地幹一下以外，是否還有別的人來代替，這就是問題糾結的所在。因此我認為關鍵是在於一般人對學徒主觀觀念的糾正，不論是經理，司賬，夥友們，最要緊的，不能認為這般鎖屑工作，是學徒們主要的日常生活，應該相反地認為這是他們不得已的附帶操作，能明瞭這一點，一切問題都能迎刃而解，這裏面者來貢獻幾個原則在下面。</p>
<p>縮短學業期限　現下一般商店中，多規定學徒的學業期限為三年，（雖然也有比較短促的）在這悠長的歲月裏，他們拿的是極低的報酬，幹的是繁重的工作，生活在這一階段裏，他們心理上極容易引起很大的變化，對現實感到憎恨。因此我認為縮短學業期限，是第一要著，其方法可參酌他們年齡的大小，決定其學業期限，自一年多至二年。</p>
<p>循循導誘　每個人都具有的自尊性，年青的學徒們也是一樣，脆弱的心地，更受不起過分打擊，偶有錯失對之不應該動　　　　，本份內的工作，應隨時從旁加以指導。</p>
<p>給予進修機會　業餘進學校補習，應儘量給予方便，若是事實上有不可能，在店內應剩出一部份時間使他們有學習機會，優良的畫報雜誌應鼓勵他們去讀，更不應該加以歧視。</p>
<p>㈣應量才分配工作　很多有主觀成見的經理們，都以學徒就業的先後來指定習慣性的工作，進店較晚的學徒們，即使有較好的才能，也不容易得到與自己才能相稱的工作，這種成見也應該打破。</p>
<p>此外商店中有主婦附居的，其家庭瑣務，絕對不應該讓學徒去幹，夥友們自己的事，儘可能不去煩勞別人，否則也應該出以和善的態度。（酬移助學）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Total War <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Modern warfare is a struggle between the entire oppressed nation and the entire invading nation. The meaning of so-called total war is twofold: first, the entire country is a battlefield; second, all citizens are soldiers. Therefore, every citizen must work on the battlefield in the posture of a soldier. The amount of national power and the duration of work are the main factors determining the victory or defeat of the war. In the process of total war, the responsibility of the citizens is to contribute their strength, and the responsibility of the government is to unite, benefit, and utilize the strength of the citizens, and further to make the national strength permanently and continuously reborn.</p>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi Sohō said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on the 13th of this month: "Today's need is not so much the increase in weapons production or food production, but rather the increase in human resources. If human resources are abundant throughout the country, then weapons can naturally be increased, and food can naturally be increased." This is a "penetrating" argument in total war. Because the power of people is higher than everything, the power of people can overcome all objective difficulties. The theory of "human determination conquers heaven" is not an empty phrase, but is proved by many historical facts and many personal life experiences. The meaning of harmony lies in uniting and uniting the power of the people. The power of unity and union is naturally greater and more lasting than the power of individuals. The saying "many people united can build a city" and "many people strike together can easily lift" best illustrates the great significance of harmony.</p>
<p>How to achieve the goal of harmony? Mr. Tokutomi Sohō pointed out four points: first, those in power must trust the people; second, they must respect the people; third, they must listen to the voices of the people; and fourth, they must stop bureaucratic politics and implement politics based on the people. What he said coincides with what we usually mention all the time, which shows that this idea of people-based governance is the same in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Anything that conforms to this rule can prosper the country in peacetime and lead to victory in wartime. Anything that does not conform to this rule, does not get the support of the people, and does not get great power, then the hope of success is naturally just seeking fish from a tree.</p>
<p>Mr. Tokutomi Sohō's only belief is based on the people's position, so that all the people willingly and sincerely contribute to the country, and the only way to implement it is to implement people-based politics. The government should sincerely be the people's servant, solve difficulties for the people, and increase welfare for the people. The government is not a bureaucratic institution but a place to serve the people of the whole country. The more the government does for the people, the more the people contribute to the country. The more the government respects the people, the more the people support the government. In this way, the whole country, from top to bottom, has the same will and gathers strength, and attacking the enemy with it will be invincible.</p>
<p>We often say to win over the people, but in fact, the people do not need to be won over. Under a wise government, the people's return is like water flowing downwards, which cannot be stopped. The original intention of what we say to win over the people lies in the government itself, which must cheer up and create a situation where the people are willing to return. The government automatically innovates, and the people automatically support it. This is the most ideal situation. Therefore, the most important thing is how the government itself strives to serve the people and seek welfare for the people. One point of service and one point of welfare will automatically attract one point of the people. The government must win over the people with political achievements. This is the most important point.</p>
<p>Total war must be based on total politics. The more tense the war, the more urgent the need for unity and union of national forces, and the more important the nationalization of politics. This is a critical moment, and I hope the whole country, from top to bottom, will encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army on the Nu River Line Adopts Individual Annihilation Tactics, Making It More Difficult for the Chongqing Army to Counterattack Due to Torrential Natural Barriers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, North Burma Front, 14th - The purpose of the Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force's counterattack this time is to open up a new route from North Burma to Chongqing to save the declining situation. After Chen Cheng resigned due to repeated defeats by the Chongqing army in the Nu River operation, Wei Lihuang was specially appointed as the commander of the Expeditionary Force, and the most elite American-style backbone officers were dispatched to assist him. Relying on air transport to supply military needs, the aim was to use all its strength to recapture the Nu River line. However, the elite Japanese army adopted individual annihilation tactics. Since the Chongqing army crossed the Nu River, it has only been raining for a month, and more than 50,000 people have been lost. Although the generals and soldiers on the Chongqing army's front line have suffered heavy losses, the leaders have not wavered slightly, and are determined to recapture the Japanese army's strategic stronghold. Recently, its elite reserve vehicles in Jiangdong have repeatedly forced their way across the river, but because the Japanese army's operations are clever, the Chongqing army is only seeking its own demise. The torrential current of the Nu River and the natural barrier of the Li River make it more difficult for the Chongqing army to maintain its supply lines. The Chongqing army's generals and officers on the Nu River frequently request the headquarters to urgently air transport supplies, but judging from the current situation, air support is the only lifeline of the Chongqing army, and air transport supplies, due to geographical conditions, often cannot find incoming aircraft. Moreover, the disease is rampant. During this rainy season, sick soldiers are emerging one after another, and because there is no medicine to treat them, the generals and soldiers have lost their will to fight, so a large number of people are fleeing. Because of this situation, guerrillas in various places are forced to become thugs, looting everywhere. The people in the villages occupied by the Chongqing army often complain to the regular army, but the regular army, due to lack of food, often loots in the name of guerrillas, so the residents rebel and flee to the Japanese-controlled area. Recently, the number of Chongqing soldiers surrendering and deserting has increased sharply. A Chongqing general and officer captured by the Japanese army once talked about the embarrassment of Wang, a general in the Chongqing army, saying that Wang, the second battalion commander of the 26th regiment of the 76th division of Chongqing, finally fled due to unfavorable battles, so the second battalion was in great chaos, and his subordinates also fled one after another. After the 76th division commander received the report, he issued a reward notice. This situation is not limited to the 76th division, but is the same in other places.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army Occupies Key Positions in Hunan, Preparing for the Next Operation, Japanese Headquarters Announces Results of Hengyang Battle <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th that the Japanese army in Hunan successively repelled the Chongqing army entrenched near Hengyang, and is preparing for the next operation. The main war results since the start of operations in Hunan on May 27 until the fall of Hengyang on August 8 are as follows: (Losses of the Chongqing Army) 66,468 abandoned corpses, 27,447 prisoners, Japanese army captured 335 artillery pieces of various types, 1,705 heavy machine guns, 13,666 rifles, and shot down, destroyed, and burned a total of 869 aircraft. (Japanese Losses) 5,343 killed in action.</p>
<p>Fierce fighting near Hengyang</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - In the battle for the key position of Hengyang, although the Chongqing army was ordered to defend to the death, it fell in only four days after the Japanese army began its general offensive. Moreover, the troops under Fang Xianjue of the 10th Army of Chongqing completely surrendered, and the security in the city gradually recovered. In order to save the declining situation, the Chongqing army is still trying to retake Hengyang, and is blindly attacking the four suburbs of the city. The Japanese army is inflicting a severe blow on it at any time, and annihilation battles are now unfolding in various places. The Japanese army in the direction of Weiyang advanced from Xiaoshu Pu south to Zhangshuxia (7 kilometers northwest of Laiyang) on the 12th. The main force of the Japanese army in the direction of Liuyang secured Shegang City (25 kilometers north of Liuyang), Gugang City (20 kilometers southeast of Liuyang) and Yong'an cities, and swept away the remnants of the defeated Chongqing army in the four suburbs. The mechanized units of the Japanese army in the direction of Liuyang advanced southward from the west side of Xinshi and reached Chang'an Station on the morning of the 11th. A part of them quickly passed Tuoba (25 kilometers south of Chang'an Station) on the morning of the 11th and is still advancing.</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - Since the beginning of August, the Japanese army on the Wei Yang front has been constantly encircling the powerful troops of the Chongqing army that have been moving north to that area. On the 9th, the annihilation battle began, sweeping away the scattered Chongqing army units everywhere. According to reports, the 41st division of the 26th Army and the 48th Provisional Division of the Chongqing Army were surrounded by the Japanese army on three sides while heading north to Hengyang from Xiaomu Pu, 8 kilometers south of Weiyang. The central unit of the Japanese army launched a night raid on the headquarters of the main force of the 41st Division on the front line of the Chongqing army, winning great military glory. As a result, the entire Chongqing army fell into a state of chaos and mistakenly identified the 48th Provisional Division of the Chongqing army, which was rescued from the right side, as the Japanese army, and fired fiercely at it, so most of it was annihilated. Due to the fierce attack by the Japanese army in the vicinity, the annihilation battle has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Extreme Panic Within Chongqing</p>
<p>Central News Agency News - Since the Japanese army captured Hengyang, the Chongqing regime vaguely admitted its fall on the 9th. According to reliable sources, the Chongqing side has shown panic in the internal battle strategy of this time. On the night of the 9th, the Chongqing military and political circles also held an emergency meeting. At the same time, in order to "calm" the people's hearts, the Chongqing "Central Political Committee" specially passed six proposals to reform local politics. In addition, the Chongqing "Military Commission" especially carried out propaganda, claiming to gather a large army to rush to aid, but the Chongqing military and political institutions in Hunan and Jiangxi were extremely embarrassed and had prepared to withdraw. The Chongqing side shouted to counterattack Hengyang, but the morale of the Chongqing army was declining and it had lost the "war of resistance" force. The local government also showed a panic situation and could not cope with the aftermath. Therefore, no one can make the so-called recovery of Hengyang by the Chongqing side a reality. In particular, regarding the fall of Hengyang, some people deeply believe that the Chongqing side cannot continue the "war of resistance" because the decisive battle in the Chongqing-Japanese war was decided by the great battle of Hengyang. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also raised this claim at the military conference held in Lushan. Chiang's broadcast on July 7 this year decided to defend Hengyang to the death.

<h3 id="e7">War Situation of Japanese Troops in Various Places <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - The war situation of the Japanese army on various fronts is as follows:</p>
<p>China Front</p>
<p>A. Hengyang Area: After the Japanese army completely occupied Hengyang in August, it secured the strategic line in that area and launched an annihilation war against the 74th, 79th, 100th, 62nd, and 37th armies (totaling ten divisions) of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang area, as well as the main force and mechanized units of the 46th Army, which recently arrived at the front to reinforce, and prepared for future offensives. B. The Chongqing army on the front of Chaling in eastern Zhejiang Province is the former 150th Division, and the Chongqing army on the front of Anren is the 133rd Division. There is no major change in the war in that area. The Japanese army is still advancing in the annihilation battle. C. The Japanese army on the front of Wei Yang is currently launching an annihilation battle against a part of the 26th and 99th armies of Chongqing at a location 18 kilometers south of Wei Yang. Currently, the war situation in that area is favorable to the Japanese army. The Chongqing Provisional Second Army once attempted to bravely return to Laiyang City and attack the vicinity of the city, but was wiped out by the Japanese army in Yangcheng and its northern areas on the 7th and 8th. D. The Japanese army on the Leizhou Peninsula launched an offensive against the Chongqing army on the Leizhou Peninsula, captured Lianjiang on the 4th, and launched an attack on the Chongqing army entrenched in Xinxu and Anpu (23 kilometers northwest of Suixi), inflicting heavy damage on it. Therefore, the Japanese army was able to attack the southern coast of Kyushu on the Leizhou Peninsula and promote a containment posture on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Burma Front</p>
<p>Because the Chongqing army's counterattack was fierce, the war situation on the entire line was extremely fierce, especially on the Nu River front. The morale of the Japanese army was extremely high, confronting the superior Chongqing army, and was still fighting. A. The Japanese army in La Meng on the Nu River front continued to fight fiercely with the superior Chongqing army, launching fierce attacks. The heavily wounded Japanese army continued to fight hard, day and night, repeatedly repelling the incoming Chongqing army, and did not leave its position for a step. In the battles from the 6th to the 9th, it caused 661 casualties to the Chongqing army, and captured more than 10,000 rounds of rifle bullets. 37 Japanese soldiers were killed in action. The superior Chongqing army in the Viet area launched an attack in unison on the morning of the 9th under the cover of more than ten fighter-bombers. The Japanese army lured them to a close distance of 20 or 50 meters, confronted each other, and suddenly launched a counterattack in the middle of the night on the 9th, defeating the Chongqing army. On the 9th, a part of the Chongqing army broke into the city, but most of them were annihilated.</p>
<p>New Guinea</p>
<p>Front: The Japanese Air Force in that area repeatedly bombed Auwai Island across from Biak Island between 2:00 a.m. and 4:00 a.m. on the 12th. Amidst the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and fighter fire, it broke into the enemy airfield, destroying 12 large aircraft and 8 airfield facilities. A large fire was seen at the enemy airfield, and it is expected that the Japanese army has achieved great war results.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Captured American Sergeant Describes Guilin Air Force Equipment, Chongqing American Air Force Indiscriminately Bombs Civilians <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Hunan Front, 14th - Central News Agency - American Army Sergeant Walter (21 years old) of the 14th Air Force, along with five of his comrades, departed from Guilin in the middle of the night on July 26, riding a transport plane full of military supplies to supply Xue Yue's army in Hengyang. While passing through Lingling, the aircraft was hit by Japanese army land-based machine guns, and the aircraft parts were damaged. The sergeant landed by parachute at a landing site that happened to be occupied by the Japanese army. The sergeant mistakenly identified the Japanese soldiers as the Chongqing army and shouted "I am an American" "I am an American" and was captured by the Japanese army. The sergeant was born in Iowa, USA. At the age of 19, he enlisted as a volunteer soldier and was assigned to the transport team (about 200 people) under Colonel William Swanson in Guilin. He transported gasoline back and forth to Kunming, delivered mail, etc. According to the sergeant's confession, there are currently 25 B40 aircraft, 15 P35 aircraft, 7 P24 aircraft, and 2 transport aircraft in Guilin, totaling 53 aircraft. There are about 60 pilots, about 500 to 600 land-based maintenance units, and about 250 officers. Most officers live a gentleman's life, while officers are mostly rascals.</p>
<p>Central News Agency News - According to reliable sources, in order to cover up the responsibility for defeat, the enemy American air force stationed in Chongqing has been carrying out guerrilla-style attacks in non-military areas with no target, causing heavy damage to the people in various places, while the Japanese army has suffered very slight losses. At the same time, the Japanese army has close cooperation with the people in various places, and has perfect countermeasures in air defense equipment. Therefore, the Chongqing American air force's blind attacks on peaceful areas have aroused the disgust of the Chinese people. In addition, the Chongqing regime believes that the American air force's aerial guerrilla warfare in Chongqing is of no real value, and only bears the responsibility for trampling on the lives and property of the people. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly negotiated with the commander of the American air force stationed in Chongqing that in the future, any area within China that the American air force in Chongqing bombs must obtain the permission of the chairman of the Military Commission, otherwise it shall not indiscriminately bombard civilians. From this point of view, the recent changes in the Chongqing regime have really seen the power of the Chongqing American air force.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Attacks Liangshan and Liuzhou</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Mainland Base, 14th - The Japanese Air Force attacked Liangshan with a joint formation of fighter-bombers on the 12th, destroying 5 large aircraft and 6 small aircraft of Chongqing, and destroyed 5 large aircraft and 6 small aircraft of Chongqing in Liuzhou. All Japanese aircraft returned to defense.</p>
<p>American Forces Illegally Attack Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Certain Base on the Chinese Front, 14th - A Japanese wounded transport plane, with a clear red cross mark on the fuselage, carrying several wounded soldiers, encountered ten American planes on its return to base. At that time, the Japanese plane was unarmed and was violently bombarded after being attacked by the enemy. It then tried to evade and caused one American plane to fall into the Yangtze River. Finally, it suddenly destroyed another enemy plane with its fuselage and then self-destructed.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin Airport</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Certain Japanese Army Base, 14th - A Japanese bomber team fiercely attacked the Guilin airport at dawn on the 14th. Amidst intense anti-aircraft fire, it destroyed three large aircraft and one small aircraft of Chongqing, and one airfield facility. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Japanese Government Decides to Establish Maritime Transport Council, Minister of Transport to Serve as Chairman of the Council <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th - In view of the fact that maritime transport can directly affect the war situation, the Japanese authorities will concentrate all their efforts to strengthen transport capacity, enabling those who are directly responsible for important maritime transport relations to undertake it. Also, the increase in transport capacity is not only a matter of simple transport relations, but also has extremely close relations with shippers and other related parties. Therefore, at the 84th Diet, the establishment of a supreme transport guidance agency was proposed, which has attracted general attention. It is now heard that this proposal has been formally decided by the government authorities, and the Maritime Transport Capacity Emergency Enhancement Council will be established, with the Minister of Transport as the chairman. As for the appointment of bureau chiefs of various ministries as members and section chiefs as secretaries, the selection of members is now being carefully considered, and it is said that the members can be decided by the end of the month, and the first meeting can also be held at the end of the month.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Emulating the Japanese Spirit of Endurance, Germany Vigorously Implements Total Mobilization, This Move May Affect the Fate of the Germanic Race <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 14th - Germany is now implementing the second national total mobilization. Its success or failure can really affect the fate of the German people. Therefore, all Germans are determined to squeeze out the last drop of blood, and their attitude of acting vigorously is the current urgent task. In order to stop the Soviet offensive, total mobilization is vigorously implemented throughout the country, and areas directly threatened by the Soviet army, such as East Prussia, feel the impact of the thunder and lightning even more. Since August 2, all German people, regardless of age, gender, or occupation, have been working day and night under the command of the Nazi political instructors, with a participation of more than 100,000 people. There are thousands of party instructors alone, which shows the proactive nature of their work in defending the border. These rear warriors include Hitler Youth from the age of fourteen or fifteen and old men over the age of sixty. As for their occupations, they range from farmers and workers to university professors. The most interesting thing is a retired elderly major general who participated in the work while hiding his identity. Later, when a military conscription order was issued, people realized that he was a general.</p>
<p>War of Survival, Balanced Burden</p>
<p>Also, in the eastern line and other areas, these rear warriors rushed to harvest new wheat and transfer it to the interior. The food supply for the next year is really not a problem. This is similar to the scene of total mobilization in the Soviet Union when the German army invaded the Soviet Union that year, indicating that what the Soviet people can do, the Germans can also do. At the moment, the German people are shouting for unity and using the total strength of the nation to defeat the Soviet Union. Regarding the total mobilization plan, announcements are published every day. By looking at Goebbels's proclamation, you can gradually understand its full picture. Goebbels's original intention is not only to thoroughly mobilize labor and military power, but also to balance the national burden of the war, so that the name and reality of the war are the war of the entire people, in order to strengthen the spirit of common hatred. This total mobilization measure can really be regarded as a spiritual total mobilization. Its system and organization are closely connected, but because the German people's individual consciousness is strong, the government should consider the issue of maintaining individual lives. Therefore, the argument of learning the Japanese people's spirit of endurance has recently become quite intense.</p>
<p>Using Labor, No Idle People in the Country</p>
<p>The German newspaper on the 12th stated that after years of struggle, based on the needs of the situation, personal life should be extremely frugal. The most eye-catching specific strategy at the moment is that officials should reduce staff. The Ministry of Railways, which has 800,000 laborers, and the Ministry of Finance, which is similar in size, are both implementing large-scale staff reductions. In addition, what is more noteworthy is the increasing organization of home industry, which can decentralize factories into smaller units. It bears a great responsibility for absorbing the labor force personnel who were previously considered unusable and put aside. Its target is women over the age of fifty without labor obligations, women with infants in their arms, and the elderly and weak who cannot work in factories. They can work slowly in their homes. From now on, Germany will have no idlers except children. The implementation of this plan to utilize surplus labor is a typical example of a total war and can be immortalized.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Rear Area Life in the Warring Nations <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>During the First World War, Germany experienced four years of Russian warfare. Therefore, in this war, in order to end the war in the short term, the so-called blitzkrieg method was adopted. However, it was not completely unprepared for a long-term war. Perhaps very difficulties would be encountered before the final victory was obtained, and this has long been considered. Therefore, efforts were made to prepare for a long-term war. The National Socialist Party government's policy of food self-sufficiency is one example.</p>
<p>It has been four years and ten months since the start of the war. During this period, the people devoted their entire lives to the war. During wartime, there were various restrictions on life, such as lighting control, food and clothing rationing, and travel restrictions, which resulted in various tiresome constraints. However, to this day, this kind of freedom has become accustomed to and regarded as natural. Moreover, since the enemy began to indiscriminately and cruelly bomb various cities last year, today there is no distinction between the rear and the front lines, and it has completely become a battlefield.</p>
<p>On the other hand, since last year, the German side has continued to fight hard on the front lines against the offensive of superior enemy forces. Although they have lived under intense enemy air raids in the past year, and unfavorable news from the front lines has continued to arrive, the German people have remained steadfast and patient, without being discouraged at all, which is truly surprising. This calm spirit is evidence that the belief in certain victory has never wavered. The reason why the belief in certain victory has not wavered must be attributed to the success of the policies implemented by the National Socialist Party government.</p>
<p>Last year, the National Socialist Party government, recognizing the imminent crisis, made overcoming the crisis its top priority. The first was to strengthen the propaganda force. Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote an article in the "German Weekly" every week, which has become a regular practice for several years. In the article, he informed the people of the crisis facing the motherland, and discussed in detail the origin and nature of the crisis, so that the people could understand the situation. He also repeatedly informed the people that Germany was fighting for justice, and the people, after listening, greatly improved their spirits.</p>
<p>The second is the provision of entertainment and food countermeasures. Immediately after the air raid, the government gave priority to the supply of food and strove to reopen cinemas and concerts. Avoiding food shortages is a fundamental prerequisite for carrying out the war, and the relationship between the stomach and the morale of the people is close. After the air raid, the supply of emergency food was extremely satisfactory, which greatly contributed to stabilizing public morale.</p>
<p>The third is the principle of strict punishment. When the country is facing a crisis, the existence of illegal elements among the people is not allowed. If such elements exist, they must be thoroughly eliminated in order to boost the morale of the people.</p>
<p>In addition, the people have absolute trust in Führer Hitler, which is inextricably linked to the belief in certain victory, which goes without saying. Although Germany is now standing at the crossroads of survival, the people under the leadership of the National Socialist Party leadership are all aware of doing their best and leaving the rest to fate. They are doing their best to fight, and the morale of the soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear is high, which is due to this.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>German bombers took only thirty to forty minutes to reach London from their bases and drop bombs. Not only that, but the supposedly impregnable French Maginot Line was soon captured, and the elite German land and air forces advanced like a raging tide to the northern coast of France, waiting for orders to cross the narrow English Channel, only twenty to thirty nautical miles wide, and land on British soil. This was Britain in the spring and autumn of 1940, with the capital, London, becoming the battlefield, the first line reached by enemy artillery.</p>
<p>Wide automobile roads were piled everywhere with old cars and materials, ready to block enemy tanks. The squares where paratroopers could land were all studded with sharp iron rods. Sixty-year-old old managers were also incorporated into the militia and took up their guns for training. At night, they hung up their rifles and stood guard in front of their companies and offices. Not only the elderly, but housewives also learned to make hand grenades and practiced throwing them at German tanks.</p>
<p>Although the situation was so tense, on the other hand, the life of Londoners still maintained a normal state in a very comical fashion. The theaters were still full, and the pubs were crowded with people, talking loudly until late at night in the hazy purple smoke.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>On June 22, 1941, the German army suddenly launched an attack on the Soviet Union from the old Polish border. From that time on, Moscow took on the colors of wartime, and martial law was immediately declared. Detailed rules for air defense orders were posted throughout the city.</p>
<p>A strict blackout was implemented from 8:00 p.m. Taking photos and filming outdoors at night, and the business hours of shops and restaurants were restricted. In addition to permanent residents, no one else was allowed to enter Moscow. Citizens carried air defense masks on their shoulders, never leaving them for a moment.</p>
<p>Air defense activities and security maintenance were organized on a district basis. Men aged 16 to 60 and women aged 18 to 50 were forced to mobilize, forming self-defense teams of 200 to 300 people to carry out tasks such as delivering orders, firefighting, and administering medicine and hygiene. Regardless of whether there was an alarm, they took turns on duty every night. However, since the winter of 1942, most of the restrictions have been relaxed.

<h3 id="e19">Abundant Coal Reserves in Various Parts of North China Are Fully Utilized According to Quality <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th - Central News Agency report: The coal produced in various parts of Greater East Asia can turn iron ore into steel, which is indispensable for war, and can directly transform into combat power. It can not only be used for ironmaking, but also be regarded as an indispensable basic resource for heavy industry and the chemical industry. Today, coal produced in various parts of Japan, such as Hokkaido, Karafuto, Kyushu, as well as in various regions within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and in North China, Mengjiang, Central China, Southeast Asia, and Manchuria, has all been converted to the above-mentioned important uses, and is being transformed into combat power.</p>
<p>Coal Resources in Greater East Asia</p>
<p>Regarding the coal resources of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the most noteworthy is the coal in North China. The coal in North China can be said to be inexhaustible in quantity and excellent in quality. There are also many types. At present, various types of coal are used effectively according to their quality and trade, in order to maximize their utilization. In short, it is enough to be completely transformed into combat power, so the most important resource is coal. Coal in North China can be classified in various ways. According to experts' classification methods, coal can be divided into bituminous coal and anthracite. From the perspective of its nature, bituminous coal can be divided into coking coal and weakly caking coal. Furthermore, from the above-mentioned uses, coking coal is coal for ironmaking, non-coking coal is fuel coal, and anthracite is coal for industrial and domestic use. The amount of coal reserves in North China varies according to experts' estimates. Let us assume that the total reserves are 130 million tons. If an average of 10,000 tons are mined per year, the amount can support 1,300 years of mining. If 50 million tons are mined annually, the mining period will be 2,600 years.</p>
<p>Transforming into Combat Power According to Different Uses</p>
<p>Based on the above-mentioned classification by use, we will further analyze the abundant coal in North China as follows. The purpose of this analysis is nothing more than to seek to transform the coal in North China into combat power. Coal for ironmaking: This type of coal should have high viscosity, low nitric yellow content, and low ash content. The most suitable for this type of condition is the coal produced in the Kailuan, Jingxing, Zhongjian, Dawenkou, and Liuhegou coal mines. This type of coal is strong coking coal in nature. If it is combined with coking coal produced in various parts of Japan, its degree of caking will be further increased, and excellent coke can be produced. Industrial coal: The coal used in light and heavy chemical industries has seen an increasing increase in production in recent years, and has become a necessary resource for North China's coal cars. This type of industrial coal is anthracite in nature, and the coal produced in the Yangquan, Mentougou, Pingxin, and Jiaozuo coal mines is the best. Among them, the coal produced in Jiaozuo, Henan Province, is particularly important in chemical industry applications. In May of this year, its reserves were confirmed to be ten times the previously estimated amount. Fuel coal: The fuel coal mentioned here refers to boiler coal. Most of the coal in North China belongs to boiler coal, and the best of these is the coal produced in Datong Fang'er. The boiler coal produced in North China is in high demand, especially in factories in Shanghai, Central China.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Promote the Construction War in Burma to Accomplish the Greater East Asia War - Statement by the Head of the Bating Survey Group - <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 14th - Central News Agency report: Dr. Batin, head of the Burmese Special Survey Group, and his party returned to Rangoon on the first anniversary of Burmese independence. Although the special survey group spent only a short period of one hundred days, it gained a great harvest. Dr. Batin is currently burying himself in sorting out the harvest of the past three months, as well as the wartime posture of Japan and other allied countries of Greater East Asia. After returning to Rangoon, Dr. Batin gave his first interview to reporters and made the following statement: It is natural that there is a shortage of wartime materials, but the Japanese people all endure everything for the sake of completing the war, regardless of their difficulties. The current policies of the Japanese government are completely based on the completion of the war, and the minimum living standards of the people are also ensured. At the same time, heavy industrial production shows leaps and bounds, and the mines and factories are as lively and productive as the battlefield. The high morale and the progress of production technology are beyond our expectations. Therefore, we cannot help but feel the desire to fight together with Japan, build together, and complete the war together. Burma has cast off all the shackles of the old Britain and the United States. At the beginning of this first year of independence, in order to restore the original appearance of the Greater East Asian nation, it is increasingly entering a full-scale construction war. The results of this survey will certainly be a driving force for Burmese construction. Under British rule, there was no room for development in the production of Burmese heavy industry. We deeply feel that it is impossible to succeed if we do not adopt the Japanese production methods and the methods of the newly emerging Manchuria. Controlling prices is by no means a policy of inflation. The system of maximum prices and official prices is one stage of controlled economy. Considering the failure of various countries in the world to suppress inflation, we should imitate the Japanese neighboring-relative cooperation system. In order to win victory, we must be slightly restricted in our freedom in order to achieve our great goals. Without victory, there is no independence and freedom. Therefore, in order to achieve victory, we must realize the above new ideas. Manchuria, the Philippines, and the Celebes are gradually realizing their ideals. How can Burma fail?</p>

<p>Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: The British and American forces operating in northern France are still planning to launch a large-scale attack on the German defensive positions from both the north and the south. South of Caen, in the Saint-Sylvain district and the Saint-Germain district, as well as at Tréharancourt, the British and Canadian forces attacked again on Saturday and Sunday, but the attack became localized after being fiercely resisted by the German forces. In the evening, enemy forces also advanced southeast of Vire, creating a local gap, which was plugged by a German counterattack. There were no major battles in the Mortain district on Saturday. Enemy forces concentrated around Alençon passed through the area and advanced to the north and east, and then launched a very major struggle. At that time, the American forces suffered heavy casualties. German defensive weapons destroyed no less than seventy-eight enemy tanks in the past twenty-four hours, and German main force aircraft destroyed another thirty. After the American attempt to seize the German fortress in Brittany by means of a surprise attack failed, they changed their tactics and are now advancing towards the strongholds of the German army along the coast, but the resistance of the German garrison is very strong, so the enemy is still unsuccessful. The battle for Saint-Malo is still in progress. The American forces have entered the town, but have been driven out again by German grenadiers in several places. In the outposts of Brest, German naval and army artillery bombarded strong concentrations of enemy tanks and dispersed them. The American forces in Loriant, who were fighting a more intense battle, withdrew again as a result of heavy losses. There were only local battles in the outposts of Saint-Nazaire. In Seine Bay, enemy ships were busy moving along the coast of Normandy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: German military sources pointed out today that the large-scale encirclement battle planned by the Allied Supreme Command between Caen and Mont in Normandy is already very obvious. Yesterday, American forces, with several formations of tanks and mechanized units, advanced north, intending to break through towards Falaise. The activities of the Canadian First Army east of the Orne yesterday were limited to reorganizing their forces. All attempts to break through were unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Paris, 13th - Central News Agency report: Reuters correspondent in Paris, Royevski, reports: The war in northern France is becoming more intense, and there are repercussions in the streets of Paris. The sound of aircraft can be heard in the air from time to time, but there are no air raid warnings. These are German aircraft flying to the French front lines passing over Paris. In the past week, rumors have been rife, saying that the American forces have crossed the city of Chartres (between Alençon and Paris), only eighty kilometers from Paris, and that the German army has stopped resisting. The agents of the British, Americans, and de Gaulle are using the trick of spreading rumors, causing unrest. It is said that August 15th is the latest date for the American forces to enter the central district of Paris. Laval has arrived in Paris, so there are rumors of the government moving the capital. However, well-informed sources say that Marshal Pétain is still in Vichy and there is no sign of any change.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 14th - Central News Agency report: The East Prussian anti-defense war is still fierce. The key point of the Soviet attack is the Leuco area, where a series of dozens of counterattacks have been launched as powerful Matthew troops continue to arrive. The German army's hard fighting has not yet allowed the Soviet army to set foot on its national soil. At the same time, forty-five miles west of Lake Pskov, the Soviet army has launched a large offensive, intending to reach the capital of Latvia, encircling Pskov to directly north of Taru, the vital point on the road to Tallinn. The German army is only making small concessions, causing the Soviet army to expend a large amount of troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th - Central News Agency report: German News Agency report: The Soviet army, which launched a fierce attack on the German fortified positions north of the Tevina River, shifted its main focus of battle to the northern road of the eastern front yesterday. Although the enemy used powerful tank formations as cover, its fierce attack was blocked by the German counterattack. The Soviet army west of Pskov attempted to advance to the northwest and both sides, where a major war immediately broke out. The German army blocked the Soviet advance to the north, while concentrated tanks and mechanized units advanced to the west. The battle is still in progress there. A group of Soviet troops who broke into the German shaped positions were cut off from their rear lines and annihilated. In the central sector of the eastern front, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked the outposts in the eastern part of the Carpathian Mountains, but was repulsed by the Hungarian army. German formations launched a successful offensive in the outposts west of the Sanok-Carpathian Mountains, driving the Soviet army several kilometers to the north. Fierce battles broke out between Mire and the Vistula River. The German air force was dispatched here and fought successfully. Hundreds of German main force aircraft and tank bombers prevented the Soviet army from transferring reinforcements to the front line, so the German formations were able to defend their positions. The German army only moved its battle line to a new position in one stronghold. West of that area, German armored units penetrated deep into the Soviet positions, and the Soviet positions immediately withdrew several kilometers to the north. Several gaps in the Ostrovetsk area have been plugged. In a powerful offensive, the German army advanced several kilometers. Southeast of Opatów, a Soviet tank attack was blocked, and the German front line advanced further in a counterattack.</p>

<p>Reykjavik, 14th - Central News Agency report: According to the Swiss News Agency, London: The recent attacks by V-1 flying bombs are as follows: V-1 flying bombs began to attack London on June 15th, and it has been eight weeks since then. They are still bombing Britain, but their intensity has decreased slightly. According to military experts, because the shooting down rate of V-1 flying bombs by the British Air Force increases when the weather is clear, the number of launches by the German army has decreased. In short, what everyone is most concerned about at present is the rocket-type bombs that will appear in the coming weeks. The "Daily Mail" reported that a certain Austrian researcher who surrendered to the anti-Axis forces said that rocket-type bombs might soon be launched at Britain from western Germany and southern France.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Future of the Japan-U.S. Decisive Battle <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Former professor at the Swedish Naval Academy and current naval correspondent for the "Swedish Capital Daily," General Aberg, wrote an article for the Japanese Yomiuri Hochi titled "The Pacific War Situation in July 1944." In it, he pointed out the battles that the U.S. military should adopt in the future, as well as the necessary preparations and strategies. He also pointed out how the Japanese military should conduct counter-operations.</p>
<p>Nimitz's Goal</p>
<p>In February of this year, U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Nimitz brazenly stated, "In the near future, the American army will land on the coast of China." Before this, MacArthur had also expressed his determination to "recover" the Philippines. There is a significant discrepancy between the operational goals expressed by these two individuals. Since occupying the important base of Saipan, Nimitz has said that the U.S. naval and air advanced base in the Pacific has taken another step deeper. However, if Saipan is followed by the occupation of Tinian, Rota, and Guam, it will expand into a consolidated and powerful base. Assuming that the American army can occupy these islands, it can effectively attack the inner lines of the Japanese army on the entire surface of the Western Pacific. However, Nimitz's next urgent operational goal may be to choose a foothold at one of three locations: Luzon, Taiwan, or Okinawa, or to seize the air force base on the Iwo Jima and Ogasawara Islands.</p>
<p>In addition, American submarines based on Saipan often appear near Taiwan. It goes without saying that American submarines often appear and disappear around the coast of mainland China, and even around the Japanese mainland. The reason why the United States was able to occupy Saipan, the Japanese supply base, is probably entirely due to the powerful cover provided by the air force carried by aircraft carriers. Another reason is the coordination with the air force stationed in China to participate in the battles for Saipan and other island bases. In addition, the U.S. bombing of the Kuril Islands from the Aleutian Islands is intended to divert the defensive power of the Japanese army and implement a containment strategy, which is also possible.</p>
<p>MacArthur's Actions</p>
<p>MacArthur has already occupied several powerful air force bases on Biak Island and Noemfoor Island. Now, the air force under MacArthur's command is using bases on these two islands and New Guinea to conduct air raids on a wide range of areas including the Caroline Islands, Palau Islands, southern Philippines, eastern Dutch East Indies, Makassar Strait, and Surabaya.</p>
<p>I believe that the naval forward base of MacArthur's army is Finschhafen Bay and Tanahmerah Bay in New Guinea. From there, they will carry out leapfrog operations towards Wewak Island and Morotai Island, and then attempt to occupy Mindanao. However, when attacking Mindanao, the cover of the Nimitz fleet attacking Yap and Palau Islands must be taken into account.</p>
<p>The Impact of the Indian Ocean Situation</p>
<p>The situation in the Indian Ocean has a great impact on the Pacific war situation. Britain wants to cooperate with the U.S. Pacific operations, and intends to recover its lost territories in the Indian Ocean and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, it is also dreaming of restoring the land transportation line between China and India, and the ocean transportation hubs from the Indian Ocean to mainland China. In addition, British submarines want to cut off the Japanese maritime transportation hubs to Burma around the Andaman Islands and in the Strait of Malacca.</p>
<p>In this situation, it is very likely that landing operations will be carried out in the Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, northern Sumatra, and Burma. The shortest distance for Britain's constant pre-war operational goal of Singapore is the narrow waterway connected to the Malai Strait and the southern Dutch East Indies islands, but due to mines, ships, air force, and coastal artillery blocking the route, the British army may carry out a roundabout battle, passing through Timor and then advancing westward to Java and then northward, joining forces with MacArthur's army and other American forces, and launching a large-scale assault on the Japanese-occupied areas, directly targeting Singapore. This is Britain's grand plan.</p>
<p>American Military Strength</p>
<p>The current strength of the U.S. Pacific Fleet can be estimated as having fifteen battleships equipped with twelve 16-inch guns, ten large aircraft carriers, eight small aircraft carriers, and about thirty escort aircraft carriers. In addition, it of course also includes the British Far East Fleet, such as three "King George V" class battleships, five other battleships, and more than ten large and small aircraft carriers, as well as many cruisers from Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>The previously disbanded Halsey South Pacific Fleet has now formed a powerful mobile force in the Central Pacific. If the Spruance fleet, which carried out the Battle of Saipan and the naval battle on June 19, had as many as eight to ten battleships and about twenty aircraft carriers as before, then the Halsey fleet would be no more than that. In addition to the 58th Mobile Task Force, there are three powerful fleets dealing with Japan, which are currently conducting main force operations individually. In addition, the small fleet under the command of Rear Admiral Kinkaid, which belongs to MacArthur, is constantly appearing and disappearing under the cover of the powerful base air force. All of the above are facts that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Operating Methods</p>
<p>From this point of view, the Japanese Navy has to confront the enemy fleet on the vast Pacific Ocean. However, the Japanese overseas army must be constantly covered by the fleet, except for the troops stationed in central China. The Japanese mainland and Taiwan are important places related to the survival of the Japanese nation, but today, when Japan's southern transportation lines are severely hampered by the Allied forces, the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean cannot be ignored. The current situation of the Japanese fleet is impossible to know the actual strength, except for speculation. In short, the current Japanese navy is inevitably too dispersed.</p>
<p>The Japanese fleet is constantly changing according to the movements of the British and American fleets. Since the Japanese army has such fleet strength, the only way to operate is to concentrate its main force in one place and carry out a piecemeal annihilation tactic. For example, when the American fleet attempts to break through the Taiwan Strait and attack southern Japan, then Japan should pour all its ships into a deadly battle with one of the two major American mobile task forces, and perhaps there will be a way out.</p>
<p>No one can deny that the longer the war lasts, the more warships the U.S. Navy will build, and thus its combat power will be strengthened. "Time" is certainly beneficial to Japan, but it is equally beneficial to the United States, and this should be known. (Translated by Lu from the Yomiuri Hochi, July 21)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Bureau of Weights and Measures Reiterates Authority <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Shantong, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures, considering that merchants and people have not thoroughly understood the knowledge of weights and measures, and that various associations have repeatedly requested clarification of the authority to inspect the measuring instruments of pharmacists, gave a speech yesterday, stating: Since the National Government returned to the capital and all undertakings were waiting to be rebuilt, the central government, in view of the fact that it is necessary to promote unified weights and measures in order to restore prosperity to industry and commerce, has re-formulated the promotion of unification and the establishment of inspection bureaus in various provinces and cities to handle the matter. In June of the 31st year, I was ordered by the former Social Bureau to prepare for the organization, and on July 15th, the bureau was officially restored and established. I immediately started to sort out and formulate centralized inspection methods by district and industry in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry, and gradually promoted them. However, due to environmental limitations at that time, and because the bureau had just been restored, both manpower and material resources were limited, so it could not be widely promoted, which is a deep regret. Since the recovery of the two concessions last year and the abolition of the First District Public Office on August 1st this year, the administrative structure of the city has been completely unified. In the face of promoting the unified administration of the city, the bureau's responsibility lies in making the greatest efforts to promote its rapid completion, in order to eliminate illegal profiteering, relieve the suffering of merchants and people, and subsidize the prosperity of industry and commerce. Regarding the recent reports from various associations that the municipal police authorities inspect weights and measures, and the police officers dispatched may not be familiar with the laws and regulations of weights and measures and inspection knowledge, resulting in those who have been inspected and qualified by the bureau or the inspection bureaus of Jiangsu and Zhejiang being investigated and punished from time to time, while the illegal British and American systems prescribed by laws and regulations are allowed to run rampant. It is the responsibility of the bureau and we cannot remain silent. A special case has been submitted to the Municipal Economic Bureau and the National Bureau of Weights and Measures for forwarding to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Industry for prompt correction in order to emphasize the administration of weights and measures.</p>

<h3 id="e45">There is an Urgent Need to Rectify Tax Revenue <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of fraud in special consumption taxes, Director Yuan of the Finance Bureau has already made a statement a few days ago and is conducting a thorough investigation. There has also been much discussion in public opinion, prompting attention. We have repeatedly offered suggestions on the rectification of fiscal affairs in the city, especially the rectification of tax revenue. We hope that after fiscal affairs are sound, the salaries of police officers serving in public office can be increased, so that they can maintain a minimum standard of living, and then we can seriously talk about administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>The exposure of this tax revenue fraud case further proves the weaknesses and loopholes in the city's tax revenue, and there is an urgent need for rectification. We hope that the municipal authorities will investigate the fraud case impartially and thoroughly, without being subject to any constraints, so that the crimes can be clearly determined and made clear to society. At the same time, regard this case as a serious lesson, a painful experience, and make a thorough reform and practical rectification of all future tax revenues, whether in terms of the system, the organization, or especially the personnel. Director Yuan stated a few days ago that he plans to make special consumption taxes an independent institution and hire well-known people from society who have experience in tax affairs to take charge of the matter. We hope that this can be realized. If we follow the old ways and do not deal with the current fraud case, and if we continue to follow the old ways in the future rectification of fiscal affairs, then the future troubles will be even greater than today's fraud case, and all the construction plans of Greater Shanghai will eventually come to nothing. This is what we urgently offer for the municipal authorities to pay attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Prohibition of Late-Night Hawking <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Recently, general electricity consumption in the city has been strictly restricted, which is due to the difficulty in obtaining coal, and is also a necessary measure to practice wartime life. The content of wartime life can be summarized as intensive production and economical consumption. Therefore, any uneconomical consumption violates wartime life.</p>
<p>Secondly, as we have said before, Shanghai is an important city in the rear, and enemy air raids are expected to be very likely. Therefore, air defense is the responsibility of every citizen and is something that every citizen should abide by for their own safety.</p>
<p>Therefore, anything that violates wartime life or violates air defense, no matter how trivial, should be reformed. To give a small example, there are often food vendors on the streets of the city in the evenings or late at night, hawking and selling along the streets, or striking objects to make noise and sell, as has been the custom for many years. First, late-night hawking disturbs the public's sleep and affects the energy of the city to work the next day. Second, the food sold is mostly for the leisure of those with little education, supplying the consumption of those who do not engage in legitimate work, violating thrift, and is not beneficial to eat, but hinders hygiene. Third, the food stalls have lights and loud hawking, which is a hindrance to air defense. We hope that the police authorities will pay attention to this and consider whether it is necessary to prohibit late-night hawking. This is one example, and anything that does not meet wartime needs, regardless of its historical customs, should be banned.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Postal Savings Bank Resumes Full Savings Withdrawal and Deposit Method <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Postal savings accounts used to have a full savings withdrawal and deposit method, whereby account holders who opened full savings accounts could freely deposit and withdraw money at any post office in the local area, which was quite convenient, but it was suspended in the 29th year of the Republic of China due to the situation. It is reported that the postal savings and remittance authorities, in view of the current traffic obstacles and the inconvenience of customers having to go to the original bank to deposit and withdraw money, have, for the sake of the public, issued an order to resume the full savings withdrawal and deposit method. The local postal savings and remittance bureau and various post offices have implemented it.</p>

All member representatives unanimously and enthusiastically supported and passed the resolution. In addition to donating 25,000 yuan in the name of the association and Cai Zixiang to the Xinwen Newspaper on August 14th to rescue out-of-school children, we are now sending the remaining 25,000 yuan and ask you to check and issue receipts accordingly.

Now, because of 'a thought of kindness' from the Cultural Bureau, out-of-school children can be rescued. If this good deed is not done, what other good deed can be done? I am donating 20,000 yuan, a small amount, to express my feelings. In the future, I will do my best to donate. There are many wealthy merchants in society. I hope that everyone will respond, so that the ideal goal of education assistance can be achieved. The country will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate."</p>

<h3 id="e54">Trends in Economic Crime <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>—Tomb Tao Xiong</p>
<p>Economic crime is a spark that occurs in the related aspects between the economic control law order and penalties. Economic criminal law, in the theoretical aspects of economic crime, is nothing more than the economic control law seen from the surface of penalties. Therefore, it is naturally impossible to know the trends in economic crime by breaking away from the economic control law.</p>
<p>The Progress of Control</p>
<p>Although Japan's economic control law order is generally said to have developed in response to the evolution of the July 7th Incident, in fact, it had already begun to progress long before the September 18th Incident. When the Japanese nation would become a loser in economic terms and be expelled from the newly acquired land that our fathers and brothers exchanged for their heads and blood, which we can never forget, the Japanese people's boiling patriotic enthusiasm ventured to rise up publicly, launching a major event, and today's Japan has a new starting point. The origin of the economic control law also starts here. Anyone who thinks about the order of economic control must clearly recognize this action that was born out of patriotic enthusiasm. The spirit of Japan's economic control law must be regarded as related to national affairs and should be accepted wholeheartedly. Therefore, it should be regarded as a special Japanese law and unfolded accordingly. Frankly speaking, the economic control law is nothing more than something that will promote the Japanese code of law today and tomorrow, but since it consistently runs through the spirit of the national polity from beginning to end, the reason why there are deep hidden things that cannot be understood lies in this relationship.</p>
<p>The economic control law that developed in this way is for the sake of the Japanese nation, so it must be powerful. Therefore, it already has the help of penalties, and at the same time seeks help from penalties. This has already become a characteristic. The reason why it is called crime and attracts attention is this reason. In 1938, the prices of export goods stipulated by the Temporary Measures Law gradually tended to expand by 32%, and in 1939, with the launch of the National General Mobilization Law, it entered the era of price control orders. Therefore, price control always seeks the help of strict penalties and has an unshakable dominance. In this era of price control, economic crime and economic criminal law appeared in a very dramatic way, so everyone paid attention to it.</p>
<p>The era of the prevalence of anti-price from 1938 to 1941 was produced in this way. However, price control is like trying to arbitrarily use penalty dams to prevent a large economic river from flowing downward, which is really impossible. Therefore, the river water crossed this dam and flowed to the sea, which is impossible to prevent. This is the phenomenon of violating prices.</p>
<p>Controlled Material Allocation</p>
<p>In order to complete price control and to remedy the prevalence of price violations, simply stabilizing prices is not appropriate, and the movement of materials themselves must be controlled. Therefore, it is necessary to control the allocation of materials. Thus, allocation control was produced alongside price control. This is because it is impossible to prevent the downward flow of river water by building a penalty dam at the downward flow, and the only way is to move the water flow itself to another waterway, so the idea of allocation was produced. For materials, this clear water flow, a certain allocation waterway must be created. Anyone who does not go through the proper waterway will be determined to have violated the allocation and will be punished, that is, to strengthen the allocation route itself with penalties. Therefore, much effort has been gradually spent on the source of materials to create allocation waterways. The rationing system is also a by-product of the amount of water produced in the allocation mechanism.</p>
<p>Control is control. The price control of one material is called the price control of other materials, and price control itself is called allocation control.</p>
<p>However, after this well-thought-out allocation mechanism is established, just like river water flowing into a fixed road and having an organized dam built, it naturally becomes a system, and an economic organization appears. Price control before control reaches the economic organization, as well as material control, is a kind of control to prevent the conclusion of sales contracts that exceed the legal price, and it is a kind of control to prevent the exchange of materials that does not reach the law. This is a behavioral control law, that is, an economic behavior law. Soon after, the economic organization itself was also controlled. Therefore, it is necessary to protect the controlled economic organization with penalties. Therefore, due to the occurrence of necessary protection, it is necessary to consider the criminal law protection of the economic organization, because it is adapted to the criminal law provisions of Article 31 of the National General Mobilization Law and Article 5 of the Temporary Measures Law for Export Goods, which aim to protect behavior. This is the economic criminal law to maintain the economic law order, that is, crimes of malfeasance and economic secrets and oil extraction in the economic field. All of this takes the existence of the economic organization law as a prerequisite and adopts a strong protective stance.</p>
<p>Two Types of Economic Crime</p>
<p>Therefore, economic crimes can be divided into two types. One type is crimes that violate the order of economic behavior, such as violating fair prices and violating allocations. The other type is crimes in which control association officials and camp group officials accept bribes and destroy the economic organization. Crimes that voluntarily allow themselves to be law-ordered in the economic control law order will certainly not disappear in the future, but there were very many of these crimes in the past. As for the latter, that is, crimes that violate the economic organization law order, are a type of crime that is certain to continue to occur in the future.</p>
<p>The current trend in economic crime is shifting from crimes against economic behavior law to crimes against economic organization law, and the center of gravity of economic criminal law is gradually shifting. All enterprises that are allowed to exist are ultimately nothing more than helpful to increasing war power and have the most social and national character; that is, it is required that each enterprise abandon profitability, get rid of dependence on capital, and operate according to the sole purpose of production. This national character of enterprises, in the world of economic criminal law, will be the possible basis for the prevalence of county magistrate malfeasance crimes. When enterprises were dominated by profitability and absolute dependence on capital a few years ago, economic malfeasance crimes could not occur and could not be promoted.</p>
<p>Today, new types of economic crimes are very numerous and are rampant everywhere, and they are becoming more dangerous. Whether those who know this situation can eradicate these crimes is really a difficult question. However, what about Japan, from the end of the Taisho era to Showa 56 (1930), how did those surging and raging ideological crimes come about? This is worth recalling. The target of ideological crimes was communists, the target of old economic crimes was small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and the target of new economic crimes is economic leaders. All of them believe in economic laws, and all of them believe in economic inevitability, that is, the ideological basis is the same. But in Japan, ideological offenders were finally able to understand the fact that spirit is better than matter, and the national polity is better than capital.</p>
<p>For economic crime, the main thing is to understand the national polity ideology. And the judges, prosecutors, and police officers who represent the Emperor in executing trials must firmly grasp their loyalty and respond to this crime by proving the existence of the national polity ideology. Economic offenders who do not have a strong understanding only know how to satisfy desires and pursue material things, and do not know that there is anything else. Compared with ideological offenders, it is easier to reawaken their long-dormant loyalty.</p>
<p>New Economic Criminal Law</p>
<p>The new economic criminal law targeting officials of control associations and camp groups is fully expressed in the Regulations on Punishing Economic Relations, but the spirit of this law is not only to simply judge the acceptance of bribes by officials of control associations and camp groups as illegal, but it should also be known that this requires the integrity of officials and public servants in control relations. In addition, domestic politics and control must follow the current situation of wartime guidance. Although the leaders are soldiers, they must also seek absolute integrity from friends. Now, when soldiers are not only on the front line, but also in the rear in the country, when guiding daily economic behavior, they must specifically express that they are loyal patriots who firmly believe in the national polity ideology. This is the method of winning victory. "Only when the inside wins can the outside win." This is a national polity ideology that has been tested for thousands of years, and it will certainly crush the economic ideology that has only two or three hundred years of history.

<h3 id="e55">Scholarship Office Work Report <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The various measures of this newspaper's reader scholarship fund are decided by the committee and implemented by the office. The office reports its work to the committee at any time. However, the scholarship undertaking originates from the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, and both the committee and the office are responsible to society. Now, as the seventh examination season draws to a close, a summary of the work of the past six months, as well as the process of this year's student selection, is reported to concerned individuals from all sectors as follows:</p>
<p>School Surveys, Visits and Interviews</p>
<p>In order to understand the situation of schools in this city and to establish contact with various schools, the office issued a school profile survey form in March of this year, requesting each school to fill it out. Visits and interviews were conducted in April and May. A total of 588 survey forms were filled out and returned by the schools. Except for a very small number of schools with special circumstances, or those that have not yet been related to this newspaper's scholarship fund, it can be said that all levels of schools in the city are included. A table of various types of schools and student numbers is listed below for reference by those concerned with education:</p>
<p>Type of School Total Number of Schools Total Number of Students</p>
<p>Elementary School 422 167,572</p>
<p>Junior High and Junior Vocational Schools 199 38,848</p>
<p>Senior High and Vocational Schools 127 17,629</p>
<p>Universities and Colleges 34 12,763</p>
<p>Supplementary Schools 4 7,385</p>
<p>Total 787 244,192</p>
<p>The total number of various schools here is 787, which is 199 more than 588. This is because 131 schools are simultaneously classified into two categories (such as junior and senior high schools being counted in both junior and senior high schools), and 34 schools are simultaneously classified into three categories (such as junior and senior high schools having affiliated elementary schools). However, the number of students is listed separately in each category without duplication.</p>
<p>As for visits and interviews, due to time constraints, they could not be carried out universally, and will need to be continued in the next semester. However, the concrete impressions gained from the schools already visited, and the results of interviews with school authorities, are quite useful for the handling of scholarship undertakings.</p>
<p>Guidance for Scholarship Recipients</p>
<p>The guidance work carried out in the last semester included the following: 1. During the visits and interviews to schools in April and May, talks were held with scholarship recipients from middle schools in each school. Schools with a larger number of students held separate sessions, while schools with a smaller number of students held joint sessions of two or three schools. As a result, the scholarship recipients were even more mindful of the high expectations of people from all walks of life and became more determined to strive. The economic methods of learning discussed were also helpful for their self-study. Some students expressed their opinions, which were also of reference value. 2. On January 14th, this newspaper's social service office jointly organized a vocational guidance lecture for high school and above students. The speakers included Mr. Pei Yunqing, Mr. Pan Yangxiao, Mr. Xu Yuanfang, Mr. Huang Xiwent, Mr. Lu Meiseng, and Mr. Chen Qishi. 3. Weekly academic lectures were held ten times from May 28th to July 30th. The lecturers were Mr. Fu Yuguang, Mr. Xu Yuanfang, Mr. Junliang, Mr. Wang Chengzou, Mr. Xu Feng, Mr. Shi Zhao Fuxin, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Jiang Zhensheng, and Mr. Fang Ziheng. The topics covered subjects such as philosophy, physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, geography, and engineering. The venues were located at Xinzha Road Elementary School, Huizhong Middle School, and the China Science Society. All scholarship recipients from high school and above chose to attend lectures based on their interest in the topic and the convenience of the time and location. Each person attended at least two lectures and submitted one set of notes. The number of attendees at each lecture ranged from 100 (limited by seating) to 300. 4. In June, a practical calligraphy competition was held for scholarship recipients in junior high and senior elementary school. Hard-nib and brush calligraphy, running script and regular script were not restricted, but certificates were awarded separately. Those who passed the preliminary selection participated in the final competition at this office on June 27, with emphasis on speed. As a result, 15 people won first prize and 32 people won second prize.</p>
<p>The Process of This Year's Student Selection</p>
<p>The method of selecting students this year is slightly different from previous years. Applicants must first have their qualifications reviewed by the school, and application forms will only be issued to those who are deemed by the school to be both impoverished and outstanding. School authorities must fill out a recommendation form for each applicant. After receiving the application form and recommendation form, the office will review them again and eliminate those with poorer grades or relatively better family conditions. The rest will be grouped, numbered, and registered. The statistics of the number of registrants this year are as follows:</p>
<p>Senior Elementary School 1,832 Junior High School 2,974</p>
<p>Senior High School 1,274 University and College 857</p>
<p>Total 6,937</p>
<p>There are two benefits of objective testing: one is that the grading can be absolutely fair, without being affected by the grader's personal preferences and psychological changes. The correctness of the answers has a certain standard, and the grading results are the same regardless of who does it at any time. This is especially necessary in large-scale examinations, where thousands of test papers need to be graded in a short period of time. The second is that the answering time is reduced to the shortest limit, and the number of test questions can be increased, so that students are not judged by chance familiarity or neglect of a small number of topics. According to the test results, the reliability of such objective tests in one session is comparable to the results of six or seven ordinary exams. The distribution of test questions for this year's test is as follows:</p>
<p>Senior Elementary School &amp; Junior High Senior High</p>
<p>Junior High 1-2-3 Grade &amp; University 1 Grade</p>
<p>Text Reading Comprehension 20 Questions 30 Questions 20 Questions</p>
<p>Character Selection 20 Questions 20 Questions 20 Questions</p>
<p>Word Usage 20 Questions —— ——</p>
<p>Literary Knowledge —— —— 20 Questions</p>

<p>Translation —— 10 Questions 10 Questions</p>
<p>Fill in the Blanks —— —— 20 Questions</p>
<p>Arithmetic 16 Questions 12 Questions 16 Questions</p>
<p>Total Number of Questions 116 122 226</p>
<p>Test Time 2 Hours 2 Hours 2.5 Hours</p>
<p>Most of the various test question formats use the multiple-choice type. Each question has four or three answers, and candidates only need to choose one. A few examples are listed below:</p>
<p>Squalid is 1. Not quiet 2. Not clean 3. Not tolerant 4. Not pleasant to hear</p>
<p>This flower is (1. also 2. or 3. even 4. and) beautiful</p>
<p>The great disaster of the Northern Song Dynasty was 1. Eunuch Power 2. Warlord Arrogance 3. Foreign Invasion</p>
<p>The place where the Yellow River breaches and causes disasters is often in 1. Luoyang Area 2. Kaifeng Area 3. Jinan Area</p>
<p>The kidney is 1. A digestive organ 2. An excretory organ 3. A circulatory organ</p>
<p>If a force of three pounds and a force of four pounds are applied at one point, the resultant force may be 1. Zero pounds 2. Five pounds 3. Twelve pounds</p>
<p>Teacher is 1. Listener 2. Teacher 3. Neighbor</p>
<p>Some of the test questions use a matching format, with four questions in a group and six answers provided for each group. Candidates choose one answer for each question. An example is given below:</p>
<p>Treat others' countries as your own, who will attack? Human nature is evil, goodness is artificial. The gentleman is wise in righteousness, the petty person is wise in profit. Those who pursue personal gain are punished, those who conquer countries become feudal lords. 1. See Analects 2. See Doctrine of the Mean 3. See Mencius 4. See Mozi 5. See Zhuangzi 6. See Xunzi</p>
<p>Preliminary testing can distinguish the academic performance of students. In addition to schoolwork, extracurricular reading and experience are also quite important. If the test results are compared with school grades, they can be mutually verified. Here are the overall grades on the school recommendation forms of the top five students in the first grade of senior elementary school to see a glimpse:</p>
<p>Gu Zhiwei 2nd place out of 37 students in Zhenying Elementary School</p>
<p>Zhu Cibin 1st place out of 74 students in Huishi Elementary School</p>
<p>Yu Depan 1st place out of 53 students in Runde Elementary School</p>
<p>Shen Fuxing 3rd place out of 72 students in Wuding Elementary School</p>
<p>Xie Baoyu 1st place out of 45 students in Shengxin Elementary School</p>
<p>As for the decision on the number of people to be approved, the amount of donations must be considered, and expenditures must be based on income. Those with particularly excellent test scores will be selected. Students who cannot be approved are not necessarily failing, but are simply limited by donations, and there is nothing that can be done. Similarly, the amount of subsidy per student must also be limited with reference to donations. Except for a few schools with particularly low fees, it is generally only enough for five or six tenths of the tuition and miscellaneous fees, which is very regrettable. The list of approved students for senior elementary school and junior high school has now been released, and the number and budget are as follows:</p>
<p>Senior Elementary School 1,200 students Budget 2.4 million yuan</p>
<p>Junior High School 1,500 students Budget 4.5 million yuan</p>
<p>Total 2,700 students Budget 6.9 million yuan</p>
<p>The list of senior high school and university/college students has not yet been released. Based on the current total amount of donations, the budget can only approve 800 students. If donations increase sharply in the coming days, the number of approved students can be increased. This is hoping for the final enthusiasm of people from all walks of life.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"How did you know the arrival time of the train?"</p>
<p>Longfu looked at his younger sister in surprise, but the appearance and body of the younger sister who he had not seen for six years had completely grown up, which made him even more surprised.</p>
<p>"It was Zhenren who telegraphed to inform..."</p>
<p>"Ah, so that's how it is!"</p>
<p>Longfu thought to himself that he would certainly tell Zhenren about taking the early morning express train, but it was really appreciated that he notified the family.</p>
<p>"Is Dad still angry with me?"</p>
<p>This was a sentence that Longfu suddenly asked his younger sister when he got on the tram from the West Station.</p>
<p>"How can you be so worried?"</p>
<p>Miss Zhi's voice was very gentle and soft. The tone was just like a newlywed wife speaking to her husband, deeply imprinted on Longfu's mind.</p>
<p>"Changed..."</p>
<p>Longfu felt strange and secretly looked at his sister's face. The slightly permed hair, neck, and milky white shoulders had the flavor of a Tokyo girl, but the sunken eyes, long eyebrows, high nose bridge, and lightly closed lips still had the shy look of Changdi.</p>
<p>(This younger sister who was scolded by her mother for climbing to the top of the tree has now changed so much...)</p>
<p>Longfu believed that his sister's change was nothing more than the result of age.</p>
<p>After changing trains halfway, they got off at Second Middle School Street. Longfu carefully looked at the houses and shop signs lined up along the street, which made him feel the infinite touch of revisiting the old place even more. Everything was the same as six years ago. Even now, he felt that Zhenren, Ren, Wandai, and others were coming from the opposite side wearing cotton clothes.</p>
<p>As soon as he arrived in Shimoarata, he immediately smelled the scent of the sea breeze blowing from Tenpozan. Sakurajima quietly revealed its head on top of the neatly arranged houses. In an instant, the street leading to his home appeared in front of him. Tears welled up in Longfu's eyes, and he could no longer look into the distance.</p>
<p>When they arrived in front of his house, Miss Zhi hurried into the house. Longfu suddenly became shy when he opened the door to his house.</p>
<p>The sound of footsteps was making noise inside the house. The glass windows rattled sharply.</p>
<p>"Ah, Longfu..."</p>
<p>His mother's voice and figure, filled with sorrow, appeared in front of Longfu at the same time. Longfu lowered his head like a criminal, unable to say a word.</p>
<p>After a while, urged by his mother, Longfu walked towards the study. Here, his father was still sitting healthily.</p>
<p>"Dad... I am guilty."</p>
<p>"Don't say any more!"</p>
<p>His father held his son in his arms, and tears could not help but flow from his eyes.</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>Like a dream, three days passed.</p>
<p>Indeed, the hometown was good. The mountains, the sea, the fish, the loquats, and even the pickles of his hometown all suited Longfu's taste.</p>
<p>His parents did not blame their son's past, and his friends were praising his success in winning the Navy Minister's award.</p>
<p>"Longfu, I am old and want to stop working for the city government and go to Tokyo to live with you!"</p>
<p>His father said this one morning when the two of them were sitting and chatting.</p>
<p>"Yes, that would be best."</p>
<p>Longfu did not dislike his hometown like the painter Ichiki, but he had to stay in Tokyo permanently in his professional position. When he thought about being a son, he felt that he should also do his filial duty and serve his parents. How happy it would be if the whole family moved to Tokyo to live together! But what he was concerned about was the timing. It would be better to live together and talk about family happiness after his position was stable.</p>
<p>"How about in five or six years?"</p>
<p>"Yes, there is no need to rush."</p>
<p>His father quietly flicked off the cigarette ash and continued:</p>
<p>"Also, Zhi is grown up now. She is already twenty years old."</p>
<p>"Should she get married?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I wanted to wait for you to come back to talk about this issue, but to be honest, I already have someone in mind."</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>"It's Zhenren-kun from the Tani family."</p>
<p>Longfu couldn't help but exclaim when he heard this sentence.</p>
<p>(Why didn't I notice this before?)</p>
<p>He really wanted to knock his head. There could be no more suitable match than this. Zhenren and Zhi-mei have known each other since childhood. Their father and mother have always praised Zhenren and the simple family style of the Zhenren family, and Longfu himself greatly respected Zhenren as such a good friend. The reason why he didn't think of forming such a good family marriage was because he always felt that the two were still children.</p>
<p>"Absolutely approve, absolutely approve!"</p>
<p>Longfu's voice was so loud that it almost startled his father.</p>
<p>"That person is definitely good, but we should have sought Zhenren-kun's own opinion earlier."</p>
<p>"Then what does Zhi-mei think?"</p>
<p>"Zhi-er? Zhi-er!"</p>
<p>His father laughed loudly for some reason.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Improvement of the Apprenticeship System <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Jing</p>
<p>The unreasonable apprenticeship system is cursed by most people. I always feel that this is the influence given by the current social system. It already has deep-rooted traditions, and it will be very difficult to eliminate it in a short time. It can be said categorically that it is impossible. The only remedy is to improve the current apprenticeship life from all aspects. Now I put it forward hoping to attract everyone's attention:</p>
<p>Sweeping the floor, emptying the spittoons, etc., are considered by people to be unworthy of work, and apprentices are made to do it. This is a destruction of young people and a burying of ambition. This view is extremely reasonable. But, apart from apprentices doing this trivial and necessary work grudgingly, is there anyone else to replace it? This is the crux of the problem. Therefore, I think the key lies in correcting the general public's subjective concept of apprentices. Whether it is managers, accountants, or partners, the most important thing is not to think that this kind of trivial work is the main daily life of apprentices. On the contrary, it should be considered as their unavoidable incidental operation. If we can understand this point, all problems can be solved easily. Here are a few principles to contribute below.</p>
<p>Shorten the Apprenticeship Period Currently, most stores stipulate the apprenticeship period as three years (although there are also shorter ones). During this long period, they receive extremely low wages and do heavy work. During this stage of life, they are very likely to cause great changes in their psychology and feel hatred for reality. Therefore, I believe that shortening the apprenticeship period is the first priority. The method can be to determine the apprenticeship period based on their age, from a little over a year to two years.</p>
<p>Gradual Guidance Everyone has self-esteem, and young apprentices are the same. Their fragile minds cannot withstand excessive blows. If there are occasional mistakes, they should not be moved [missing character], and their own work should be guided from the side at any time.</p>
<p>Provide Opportunities for Further Education Convenience should be given as much as possible for studying in schools in their spare time. If it is actually impossible, some time should be left in the store to give them opportunities to learn. Excellent pictorial magazines should be encouraged to read, and they should not be discriminated against.</p>
<p>4. Distribute Work According to Talent Many managers with subjective prejudices assign habitual work based on the order in which apprentices are employed. Apprentices who enter the store later, even if they have better talents, do not easily get work that matches their talents. This prejudice should also be broken.</p>
<p>In addition, if there are housewives living in the store, apprentices should absolutely not be allowed to do their household chores. Partners should avoid bothering others as much as possible for their own affairs, otherwise they should also show a kind attitude. (Remuneration to help study)</p>

<p>The Hualian Pharmaceutical Factory Medical Laboratory, regarding impoverished men and women in society who wish to have their bodies checked or who suffer from illnesses and require laboratory tests to diagnose the source of their ailments, are often limited by their financial circumstances and unable to fulfill their wishes. From today onwards, amidst their heavy workload, they will extend an invitation to experts to dedicate a portion of their time each day to perform voluntary laboratory tests. We have received one hundred free laboratory test referral letters, and impoverished sick men and women can apply for referrals at this office.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Chinese Dental Disease Prevention and Treatment Hospital, established to this day, is about to complete two decades of serving society. Benefiting people and assisting them is its aim. Because there is a free treatment department, it is dedicated to serving impoverished patients with volunteer work. At a time when all goods are expensive, the cost of drugs and materials used by the hospital has also gradually risen, but in order to alleviate the suffering of the poor and sick, the task of free tooth extractions will continue. Now, in order to expand the scope of services, a type of free tooth extraction certificate has been printed for distribution to the poor and sick. We have received twenty of these and will distribute them on your behalf. The new scheduled registration time for free tooth extractions at the hospital has been changed to 8:30 AM to 9:30 AM every morning, starting today. It is hoped that patients will take note.</p>

<p>The document specialist school organized by this newspaper has already completed its initial training. Several dozen first-year graduating students, in order to seek further research and deeper study, have begun to organize the Chinese Document Research Society, which has been preliminarily established. The main subjects of study are applied writing, official document formats, and file management. Leading scholars and document experts have been invited to serve as mentors, and it has been stipulated that every Wednesday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM, gatherings will be held at the China Moral Righteousness General Association on Nantong Road to discuss and learn from each other, in order to gather wisdom and expand our thinking. Any young person over the age of 18 with good character and a desire to study documents, regardless of gender, may join as a member. The lecture fee is 200 yuan per person.

<p>The Private Hualian Middle School on the sixth floor of the Xueye Building, No. 255 Beijing Road, is known for its strict training of young people. Last semester, entrusted by this office, it ran the vocational training class with remarkable results. The school's principal, Mr. Chen Tianyu, is now tentatively planning to continue establishing a simplified senior high school commercial program. All subjects will emphasize practical application, so that school education and social life can be integrated. The program will last one year and the tuition will be low. Those from impoverished families can also request assistance. Anyone who has graduated from junior high school or has an equivalent level is welcome to register. The exam will be held on the morning of August 25th.</p>
<p>The Zhengfeng Elementary and Middle School at No. 60 Yongjia Road, in order to encourage outstanding young people, will hold scholarship examinations on August 13th and 27th. Those with excellent conduct (those with above-average conduct grades from their previous school) and a score of 70 or above on the entrance exam will be exempt from half or all of their tuition fees. There will be 20 students each for elementary and middle school. There is also a half-day class that teaches major subjects such as Chinese, math, and general knowledge. The program is divided into three terms and lasts four years, with a level equivalent to elementary school graduation. Tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees are only 250 yuan. Classes have already started and there are still openings.</p>
<p>Students from the Hongshe and Mingxin (formerly Lixin) Accounting Schools in this city, in view of the large number of out-of-school youth, especially students and apprentices in shops who lack vocational skills, have specifically established the Hongxin Obligatory Accounting Tutoring School with funds raised by Hongshe. All faculty and staff are volunteers from the Mingxin University alumni association. In addition to waiving all tuition and miscellaneous fees, textbooks are loaned and paper is provided, which is a great blessing for impoverished children. Registration begins on August 15th and classes will be held from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM every day, starting on September 1st. School address: No. 48, Lane 41, Jiading Road (Card Road), inside Guangzhong School. Details and brochures are available upon request.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Private Huai'en Elementary and Middle School's "Guiqin Scholarship," which offers free and half-price student aid to twenty students each, still has openings. A second exam will be held at 9:00 AM on August 18th. Students with excellent character and academic performance from impoverished families in senior high school grades 1 and 2, as well as all levels of junior high and elementary school, may apply. School address: No. 32, Wangjiasha Garden Road, Datong Road (formerly Avenue Edward VII).</p>
<p>The Private Jiancheng Elementary and Middle School at the intersection of Baker Road and Datong Road has established the Jiancheng Student Aid Fund for three years. This year, more than 400,000 yuan will continue to be raised by all teachers and students to continue the program. Those from truly impoverished families with excellent academic and behavioral records can receive full tuition and miscellaneous fee assistance. Those from impoverished families with acceptable academic and behavioral records will also receive half-price or more assistance with meals. There are still a few openings available. Those who cannot afford to attend school should apply quickly.</p>
<p>The Central Vocational Obligatory Night School aims to assist outstanding impoverished out-of-school children. This year, it will begin to enroll new students. Anyone from truly impoverished families with a desire to study may apply, regardless of age or gender. Levels: Three classes of 60 students each will be accepted for Senior Elementary School Book 4 and Junior Elementary School Book 8 and Book 4. Time: Every evening from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Fees: Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, books are provided, and a security deposit of 200 yuan is collected, which will be returned at the end of the semester. Registration: From now until August 19th (registration will close when full). Exam: August 21st and 22nd, 7:00 PM. School starts: August 25th. School address: No. 189, Lane 9, Dean Lane, North Suzhou Road.</p>
<p>Qingyun Elementary School, in order to help out-of-school youth, has specifically set aside a fund donated by the school's board of directors to provide assistance to impoverished students. This semester, sixty scholarships will be temporarily established. Those from truly impoverished families who are healthy, and whose academic and behavioral records are above average, may apply. Registration begins immediately and the exam will be held on August 22nd. School address: No. 365 Minguo Road (intersection of Yongan Street).</p>
<p>The General Association of Charity Schools organized by the Vocational School Friendship Association has been in operation for almost a year. However, because the lease on the school building inside the former Beijing Road Vocational School has expired, the new school building has been located inside Chunyi Elementary School on Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road. Registration will begin on the 3rd of this month from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. Classes start on the 20th. Time: 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM daily. Grades range from Junior Elementary School Grade 1 to Junior Elementary School Grade 4. In addition to retaining places for old students, new students will continue to be recruited, regardless of age or gender.</p>
<p>The night schools organized by the Jiashen Obligatory Education Society are successively recruiting new students. The first school is located inside Chunyi Elementary School at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Ningbo Road and specializes in Grades 4 and 5 of elementary school. The second school is located inside Fumin Elementary School in Maler Lane at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. The third school is located inside Ma'an Lane on Dagu Road and specializes in Grades 1 to 6 of elementary school. The curriculum is the same as the daytime curriculum. Classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night. Registration begins immediately. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are waived, and a security deposit of 100 yuan is collected, which will be fully refunded at the end of the semester if there are no absences.</p>
<p>Secondhand Book Service - The Ziqiang Secondhand Book Service Society, in view of the current high price of books and the difficulty students have in purchasing them, the purpose of this service is to lend secondhand books for reading to those who cannot afford to buy them, and no rent will be charged. Those who wish to borrow must lend books they have previously read to the society in order to exchange them. It is temporarily divided into junior and senior high school sections. The lending period is set from August 5th to 25th, and the borrowing period is from August 25th to September 5th. We hope you will participate enthusiastically. Service hours: 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily. Address: Chengyi Middle School, No. 694 Taishan Road. However, because the society does not have a university section, it is expected that there will be few books for senior high school Grade 3. Therefore, we sincerely hope that students in senior high school Grade 3 last semester can assist by voluntarily lending as many textbooks as possible. We welcome you. Also, in response to the needs of students this autumn, a consignment book department has been specifically set up. Prices for consignment are negotiated, and a handling fee of 5% is charged after the sale. All of the fees, after deducting expenses, will be used for this newspaper's scholarship fund.</p>
