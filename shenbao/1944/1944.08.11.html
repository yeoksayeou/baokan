<h3>社評　人和事的脫節</h3>
<p>近年中國政治上，最足表示出人和事脫節情況的，是陳市長在複興節所說的「人人無事，事事無人」一句話。這是一句老實話，敢說老實話的，然後才有通氣發行現代政洽。</p>
<p>這個問題發生於民國初年革命運動之後，可是三十餘年來，大家都把心思用在政務上，政制上，大家都研究中國政治的體制，怎樣設立院，部，會等待大問題，而很少有人注意到得勝人才和訓練人才。可是，人事是一切政治問題的基本，假如這個基本問題沒有處置得好，任何政治體制，政治理想，任何良好計劃都沒法子推動和執行，有利於老百姓的好政策，往往轉眼間便變成最害老百姓的壞政策。</p>
<p>樹立文官制度是使人和事合節的唯一方法，文官制度樹立之後，可以使每個人永久做他所適合的事，可以使每件事永久有適合的人去做，所謂人盡其材，事盡其利。人和事適當之後，才能夠表現出最大的功效。樹立文官制度的最要方法是考试和銓敘，考试可使人不能夠倖進，銓敘可勉勵人永久勤奮，假如各級政府機關，根據各別的事務，公開招考適合的人才，至少對於「事事無人」一個問題先解決了一些。假如政府人員，根據各別學識，經驗，和辦事成績，個別的加以銓敘，那末，一部分人員不再能夠「屍位素餐」，對於解決「人人無事」這一個問題至少有相當的幫助。</p>
<p>在政局動　，人心不安的時期，主持政局的人物目的首在實行他的政策。要實行他的政策就不能不擴大他的幹屬。因此，親戚朋友的援引和鑽營，勢所不免，儲云「一人得道　雞犬昇天」，正是這個畸形政治的寫真。可是，這是過渡現象，過渡現象是不能長久的，假如這種過渡現象永久繼續下去，則人事紊亂，政治腐敗，乃爲必然的結果。賢明的政治家就當把握時機，澈底改造，使動盪的政治立即導入正軌，人事管理機構，公正地處理一切人事問題。人事健全之後，推進政治然後有適當的人。有適當的人來推動政治，然後政治才得現清明的曙光。</p>
<p>人和事的脫節，對於國家政治的影響，已如上述。基准，對於個人本身亦有極大的害處。假如一個機關裏多是些不相幹的不能做事的人，那末，第一，有能力的人鼓不起興趣來工作，勢必敷衍了事，消磨壯志；第二，對於一般鑽營援引而來的人，養成懶惰頹廢的習性，更可毀了他的綞生。所以在人事不合拍的機關裏做事，對於個人本身亦是一種浪費，一種損失。因此，政治家爲了國，爲了人，務必在這個緊要關頭，趕快設法，消滅這個畸形的狀態。</p>

<p>第四條　第一項工商業同業公會之，須有同業公司行號五家以上之發起，但主要商品同業公會，得由地方主管官　指定發起人命令其組織。</p>

<p>各地同種類之主要商品同業公會，應分別組織各　同業聯合會，加入全國商業統制總會爲會員，辦理編制有關事宜。工商同業聯合會除受中央主管官署之指導監督外，並受全　商業統制總會之指導監督。</p>

<h3>戰時房屋租賃　爭議處理法　政院會議已通過</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　社會福利部關於戰時關於房屋租賃問題，房東與房客每多因加租辭房等事宜而發生糾紛，甚至入　法庭。茲爲解決此項糾紛，　草　戰時　　租賃爭議處理法，葉經提交八月八日行政院第二一九會議通過，將呈請中政會議案公佈施行。</p>
<h3>日海軍航空部隊　擊沉敵潛艇兩艘　大宮島日軍邀擊重創敵軍</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地十日中央社電　日海軍航空隊，九日在台灣東南海域及大島附近，各擊沉敵潛艇一艘，於大島海面擊沉之敵潛艇，係正浮出中遭魚雷奇襲而沉沒者。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地十日中央社電　大宮島之日軍守備隊，八月上旬以來，在明石街東方郊外及哈爾他山附近邀擊敵軍，與以重創，其後戰線移往北方，目下猛攻北方山陵地帶之敵軍，自七.八兩日以來，兩方戰線交叉，到處作局部之激戰。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地十日中央社電　日軍主力自由瓜　爾納爾轉進以來，其餘殘留該地從事遊擊戰之部隊，國家經委即行斷絕，不料最近該部隊南獲敵魚雷艇後，即與日軍基地取得國家經委，現已判明該部隊全體，刻正以密林爲根據，與敵人從事遊擊戰中。該方面國家經委員，又複乘滿載彈藥之魚雷艇，於基地守備隊歡呼中，再　向瓜　康納爾進發。</p>
<h3>日空軍　襲贛州機場　擊毀渝美機七架</h3>
<p>中國前線某基地十日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，九日黎明，急襲江西省贛州（浙贛線之間）飛機場，擊毀渝美機七架，並痛炸其軍事設施後，全機安然而返。茲誌該役略情如次：是日上午三時半，日機冒惡劣天氣，侵入渝軍基地上空，對掩護中之渝美機作低空轟炸。　有小型機五架，中彈起火，並擊毀小型機二架，車四輛，同時更對似爲燃料彈藥庫者二所，加以轟炸，但未見起火。該地渝軍因有後退模樣，故機場內僅有小型機若幹架，又因未見燃料庫起火，料其所有資材業已後撤。</p>
<p>渝機襲衡損失九架</p>
<p>大陸前線現地十日中央社電　八日上午曾有渝P40飛機約二十架來襲衡陽，上空哨戒中之日貢當即實行邀擊，激戰後計擊落渝機七架，擊毀二架，是役日方僅三架未飛還。又是日下午，日機於湖北省南方之新堤上空，再度發現渝P40型機約十架來襲，當擊落渝機三架，日方全機安返原防。</p>
<p>韶關居民紛紛遷移</p>
<p>廣州十日中央社電　日軍自攻陷衡陽後，韶關渝軍鑒于環境惡劣，除將第七戰區所屬各部遷至贛南外，渝省政府當局暨所屬各機關，業已遷抵邇縣，韶市人口數達五十萬，但經渝軍強迫疏散，民衆即紛紛遷從別地，所有學校均於一月二十七日停課，內有逾限仍未離市者，即被驅逐出境，並隨時檢間國民兵身分證。一般青年爲避免強迫擴充兵役，多自願返和平區。現觀韶關當局似有凖備放棄該地之意，目前韶市一片荒涼，已成死市。</p>
<h3>雷州半島　日繼續進攻</h3>
<p>前線某基地十日中央社電　雷州半島之日軍，自七月末以來，擊潰以廉江爲足以之渝軍第一百五十五師之後，乃由廉江　轉面下，掃蕩該地以南之殘敗渝軍。八日對渝漢西北二十五公里地之渝軍，開始猛攻，八九兩日之戰鬥，渝軍遺棄屍體五八〇具，被　俘四一〇，日軍仍繼續攻擊中。</p>
<h3>京行莊註册　決嚴密辦理</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　前聞財政部對於南京地方設立金融機關已經截止註冊，惟近仍時有行荘開業，記者特訪財政部當局，承將辦理情形見告如下：查上海方面金融機關，早經本部於三十一年十二月十八日發表談話，截止註冊。至南京各金融機關，亦經本部核定不准新設，前申請設立金融機關，其是文在本年四月一日以後到部者，一律批駁，在三月三十一日前呈　設立者，仍照章核辦。近來攝氏所載新聞業之行荘，或因籌備磁係，方於最近開業，或尚在籌備而其呈請設立日期均在截止以前。此外少數錢荘，因業務關係，經呈請本部核准改稱銀行，重行正式開業，並非新設之金融機關。最近又據報已經本部核准設立尚未開業之各行荘，有因無力經營，得勝截止註冊機會，將本部已核准設立之行莊牌號，以高價售與他人。甚有業已倒閉之行荘，猶以應行鄉銷之營業執照，向外求售，冀　漁利，此種不法行爲，實堪痛恨。本部現正嚴罰調查，如有確據，定必從嚴懲處。本部對於現有各行荘之申請增資，或改名稱，或改選董監等項，一向從嚴審核，如發現有上述情事，亦必嚴懲不貸，以杜流弊。</p>
<h3>軍訊會議　行閉幕典禮</h3>
<p>南京十日中央社電　軍事委員會全國各級無線電台軍訊會議，於昨十日上午十一時十分，假國民大會堂二樓室，隆重舉行閉幕典禮。陳代委員長特派飽總參謀長代表至訓。閉幕後全體會員攝影留念。</p>
<h3>日對飛機零件　決大量生産　並强化人造石油企業</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本科學技術　　會航空部，前爲高度運用現有施設次材及勞力，以期增産起見，曾召開會議討論一切，茲悉已決定大量生産飛機零件。九日並發表對際海軍大臣之咨詢答凝內容如次：本回答爲提高飛機生産技術，確立技術方式，同時，爲使現生産能力向上，故　重點於飛機零件之製作。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本政府爲應付戰局之需要，特强化人造石油之生産，故最近曾有實施燃料與　公司人造石油直營之舉，對關內人造石油企業，斷然使之強化，對燃料公司則付與相當生産　　。又從來曾時極儀論之人造石油之　格與戰局之關聯，最近由於石油補給之緊迫，此等事項，至此即見實現，故燃料公司關於　資材及資金之週旋，　技術之指導及其交流與通用，　生産補充計劃及物資動員計劃之參　等帶來及其他反敗爲勝造事業之直營口化，益加强化。其餘合統制已與政府表　協力，確保人造石油生産，而燃料公司並吸收既存數公司爲直營製造工廠。此外並以其他數有力公司爲對象，亦着着確立凝集機能儀式，最近實現之新企業方式，將來對華北人造石油之供給，頗值注目。</p>
<h3>泰外長聲明　促進對友邦親善</h3>
<p>盤谷十日中央社電　本塞那外長九日上午會見記者團時，闡明新政府外交方針如次：關於泰國之外交關係，首相於三日國民議會中已有所說明，今後將據此以促進與友好國，尤其是日本之親善關係，本政府於駐在盟邦各國之外交使節，亦決不作任何　動也。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　日情報局十日發表：任海軍大將男爵鈴木質太郎爲樞密院議長，任樞密院顧問清水證爲樞密副議長，於十日下午舉行親任式。</p>
<h3>緒方總裁發表　尊重言論方針</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日本　政會九日下午於本部舉行情報宣傳部理事會，並招情緒方情報局總裁，就現時局下宣傳報道各方面舉行　　，席間緒方總裁發表尊重言論之方針如次：自由言論報道之取締，除對完　戰爭及　行國策不所障害者外，將作根本之改革，對不必要之取締，更考慮概予中止，至言論在可能內當予以尊重，同時輿論之指導，以報紙爲對象，又　政會方面並提議　各省所屬之情報宣傳機關，統合於情報局，藉以強化統一。　鑒於思想戰爲戰爭最後之決定條件，故情報局應有「思想戰爭之性格」，關於此點，緒方總裁已表示贊同。</p>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日大政參贊會首腦部　衡結果，認爲目前國民運動之强化，實有與情報局加深密切關係之必要，故決由緒方情報局總裁責任該會副總裁。</p>
<h3>教皇駐菲使節　責難美暴行</h3>
<p>馬尼刺九日中央社電　教皇駐馬尼刺使節皮裏尼師八日發表談話，略謂，本使節對美兵侮辱職死日本兵遺體之獸行，根據教會訓戒，認爲絕對應加禁止，值得擠烈責難者，以基督教徒言，斷不能默視此種行爲，同時亦爲人道所不許，本使節將以菲律賓教區長名言，對此種獸行加以論罪。</p>
<p>裏斯本十日中央社電　美國民主黨史衆議員華爾達，前曾將日戰士骨骸作成之裁紙小刀，寄贈羅斯福總統，此殘忍事件，引起國際間非難，據華盛頓電，羅斯福對此事亦自覺慚愧，似欲將該刀返還原主，據合衆社訊，該物業已返還原主，同時總統並勸原主，將該物予以掩埋。</p>
<h3>東普魯士國境　展開攻防戰　德中部地區防壁堅固</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　德軍當局九日發表東部戰線各地區之戰況如下：　維斯杜拉河套地區，蘇軍由維斯杜拉河西岸之橋頭堡向北方及東方再取攻勢，激戰後突入行軍陣地數處，行軍當即反擊，迂回　加迴至其先鋒隊側面中深處，截斷其後路，同時並擊退蘇軍主力。巴爾加橋頭堡之戰況亦甚激烈，曾有戰局主動性之德機甲車，開始向東方猛攻，且以衝鋒戰緊縮巴爾加橋頭堡。　東普魯士東部國境比亞裏斯克西南方之蘇軍，八日再展開大規模機甲攻勢，激戰後，突入德陣地數處，德軍立即猛烈反攻，阻止其前進，目下繼續激戰中。斯瓦魯基至尼蒙之德軍，阻遏蘇軍攻擊，蘇軍未能接近國境一步。　東普魯士東北國境拉塞尼亞地區，八日展開大攻防戰，蘇軍發動大批戰車，在狹小之戰線上猛攻德軍陣地，海戰數刻後，德軍由拉塞尼亞撤出，其後複再增援作激烈之反攻，卒將拉塞尼亞之蘇軍擊退。</p>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　中部地區原德軍司令官美迭爾元帥九日發表談話謂：德軍於過去數週間之撤退作戰已完畢，目下已臨阻止敵軍之時，德軍新銳防衛兵力，陸續抵達中部地區，形成堅固不動之防舉，後方所供給之兵器兵力，　　不斷，餘對德國國民之忠勇，實寄與滿腔之信賴。</p>
<h3>美軍在義　將作新登陸</h3>
<p>柏林十日中央社電　海通社軍事採訪主任塞托貿斯稱：　　微兆顯示，反軸心軍凖備在美國再行登陸，此事將由美第五軍主持之，該軍在阿　河　線久已不活動，其防區已大部由貢第八軍接管。新登陸　大約爲　古利安沿岸，但以地　而言，以在亞得與亞海登陸較爲有利，因該處係北義低地，可供大隊坦克車作戰。在利古利安沿岸及熱那亞　高山　延至沿岸，難　橋頭堡，亦難向北　　推進。反軸心軍在此登陸，或有二種原因，　希望佔領熱那亞港，　德軍在阿諾河線之意外堅强抵抗，亞歷山大將軍尚不能決定是否由下面突破德防線。</p>
<h3>德正檢討　徵用婦女</h3>

<h3>日新內閣　對華政策不變　谷大使會見記者團發表談話</h3>

<p>政策不變</p>

<p>經濟協力　　　關於日對華經濟上之協力，如農產方面，中國當局已具有縝密計劃，本年由於天時上之有利，大可豐收，本人對此深爲欣快，如工業方面，日本竭力援助，此次小倉顧問特返國向日本朝野商洽，期待不久來華後，當有良好明朗之結果。　泰國此次內閣之改組，乃爲强化協力大東亞戰爭之完遂，新任內閣總理，對於大東亞之認識深切，殊爲泰國深慶得人云云。</p>

<p>讀者助學消息</p>
<h3>一則欣慰一則怨艾　同樣熱情得到相反的結果</h3>
<p>本屆助學金核准學生名單，小學及初中部分，已在昨天本報第四版發表。這一張白紙黑字，雖不是什麼國際間的重大消息，雖不是什麼社會上的新奇要聞，不過是一張枯燥的名單，旣沒有細讀的價値，也不會引起一般讀者的閱讀興趣。可是，我們深信，至少有五千人以上，懷着非常熱烈的情緖，非常緊張的心弦，從頭至尾，一字不茍地細心閱覽，甚至細看數遍。至少有一萬人以上，懐着同樣的心情，張眼傾耳的悉心地聽。結果，二千以上閱覽的人，見到了自己的姓名，內心會浮現情不自禁的歡欣。五千以上傾耳靜聽的人，聽到了自己兒女的名字，會流露着興奮的安慰。這一輩人就是申請助學金核准的學生及其家屬。</p>
<p>同時，至少有二千人以上見不到自己的姓名，五千人以上聽不到自巴兒女的姓名，而感覺痛苦，會怨艾，會流淚，這一輩人就是申請助學金而未能核准的學生及其家屬。不過，在這二千餘學生中，大部分的成績也是優秀的，所以不測核准者，幷不是他舞不合「清寒優秀」的標準，完全為了我們收到的助學金不數支配，關於這點，我們難過的心情，正不下於未測核准的學生。</p>
<p>現在，我們唯一的希望，請求讀者諸君，尤其是殷富鉅商諸公，發揮一念之善，捐輸若千，我們就可以在未核准學生中依次撥助。我們正留出篇幅，以爲捐欵諸君宣揚仁風，使社會咸得景仰。</p>
<p>茲爲便利各中小學校查考起見，已印就核准學生名單單行張六百份，各校如須索閱，請憑條蓋章向本館社會服務處索取。</p>
<p>元泰公司慨助鉅款　　元泰實業公司電業部昨慨捐五萬金，熱心助學，至堪欽佩，茲錄來函如下：「逕啓者，自貴報經辦助學金以來，社會熱心人士，共相響應，捐輸巨款，建立樹人之大業，使一般無力求學之優秀子弟，得以絃歌不輟，嘉惠淸寒，搶救失學，良深敬偑。茲奉上國幣五萬元，捐充貴報助學金，至請察收，雖屬棉薄之助，聊盡國民應　之義耳。」其餘如新成概捐三萬元，朱氏節治喪費三萬元移充助學金，均足欽佩。</p>

<h3>Editorial: Disconnection Between People and Affairs</h3>
<p>In recent years, the most telling sign of the disconnection between people and affairs in Chinese politics is the statement made by Mayor Chen during the National Day celebrations: "Everyone is idle, and every affair lacks personnel." This is an honest statement, and only by daring to speak honestly can modern politics be ventilated and developed.</p>
<p>This problem arose after the revolutionary movement in the early years of the Republic of China. However, for more than thirty years, everyone has focused their attention on political affairs and systems. Everyone has studied the structure of Chinese politics, how to establish the Yuan, ministries, and commissions, waiting for major issues, while few have paid attention to obtaining and training talent. However, personnel is the foundation of all political issues. If this fundamental problem is not handled well, any political system, political ideals, or good plans will be unable to be promoted and implemented, and good policies that benefit the people will often turn into bad policies that harm the people.</p>
<p>Establishing a civil service system is the only way to harmonize people and affairs. After the civil service system is established, everyone can be permanently engaged in the affairs they are suited for, and every affair can permanently have suitable people to handle it, so that people can make the best use of their talents and affairs can be utilized to their fullest potential. After people and affairs are properly matched, the greatest effectiveness can be demonstrated. The most important methods for establishing a civil service system are examinations and personnel assessment. Examinations can prevent people from seeking advancement through luck, and personnel assessment can encourage people to be permanently diligent. If government agencies at all levels, based on their respective affairs, openly recruit suitable talents, at least some of the problem of "every affair lacking personnel" will be solved first. If government personnel, based on their respective knowledge, experience, and performance, are individually assessed, then a portion of the personnel will no longer be able to "occupy positions without performing duties," which will at least provide considerable help in solving the problem of "everyone being idle."</p>
<p>During times of political turmoil and public unease, the primary goal of those in charge of the political situation is to implement their policies. To implement their policies, they cannot help but expand their staff. Therefore, the recommendations and maneuvering of relatives and friends are inevitable. As the saying goes, "When one person attains enlightenment, even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven," which is a true depiction of this deformed politics. However, this is a transitional phenomenon, and transitional phenomena cannot last long. If this transitional phenomenon continues permanently, then personnel disorder and political corruption are inevitable results. Wise politicians should seize the opportunity to thoroughly reform the system, immediately bring the turbulent politics back on track, and let the personnel management agencies fairly handle all personnel issues. After personnel are sound, there will be suitable people to advance politics. With suitable people to promote politics, then politics can see the dawn of clarity.</p>
<p>The impact of the disconnection between people and affairs on national politics has been described above. Furthermore, it also has great harm to individuals themselves. If an organization is filled with irrelevant people who cannot do things, then, first, capable people will not be motivated to work and will inevitably do things perfunctorily, wasting their ambitions; second, it will foster laziness and decadence in those who have maneuvered their way in, and may even ruin their lives. Therefore, working in an organization where personnel are mismatched is also a waste and a loss for the individual themselves. Therefore, for the sake of the country and the people, politicians must seize this critical moment and quickly find ways to eliminate this deformed state.</p>
<h3>Central Political Council Passes Amendments to the Provisional Regulations for Trade Associations; Materials Investigation Committee Decided to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Central Political Council held its 158th meeting at 8:00 AM on the 10th, and passed the following important cases: The chairman handed over for discussion a draft amendment to the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, submitted by Chen Jun, Minister of Industry, requesting review and guidance. The decision was made to pass the draft and send it to the National Government for promulgation and to the Legislative Yuan for record. The chairman handed over for discussion a memorandum from the Executive Yuan, forwarded from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the planned work of the Materials Investigation Committee had been completed. The committee no longer seemed necessary, and a request was made to abolish it. The decision was made to pass the draft and send it to the National Government for an explicit order for immediate abolition. The chairman handed over for discussion a request to relieve Wan Xuan, a judge of the Special Court of the National Government, of his duties due to other appointments, and to specially appoint Yan Likun as a judge of the Special Court of the National Government. The decision was made to pass the draft and send it to the National Government.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) To strengthen the management and adjustment of the establishment and organization of industrial and commercial trade associations, the Ministry of Industry has amended the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, which was passed by the Central Political Council on the 10th. The amended original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Articles 1 to 10 remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Article 3 The competent official for industrial and commercial trade associations is, except for the silver and money industry, the Ministry of Industry at the central level, the Department of Construction in each province, the Bureau of Economy in each special municipality, and the county government in each county. However, for industrial and commercial trade associations located in the location of the Department of Construction and Bureau of Economy, the Department of Construction or Bureau of Economy remains the local competent authority. Members of trade associations who operate in the silver and money industry are subject to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the Department of Finance, or the Bureau of Finance, and must still register with the Ministry of Industry, the Department of Construction, or the Bureau of Economy.</p>
<p>Article 4 The establishment of an industrial or commercial trade association requires the initiation of five or more companies or firms in the same industry. However, the primary commodity trade associations may be designated by the local competent authority to initiate and order their organization.</p>
<p>Articles 5 to 11 remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Article 12 (Added) When necessary, primary commodity trade associations may submit a request to the central competent authority for approval to merge two or more primary commodities to organize.</p>
<p>Articles 13 to 21 (originally Articles 12 to 20) remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Article 22 (originally Article 21) With the approval of the central competent authority, or its order, industrial and commercial trade associations of the same kind in various places may organize an industry federation.</p>
<p>Primary commodity trade associations of the same kind in various places shall separately organize each industry federation, join the National General Association for Commercial Control as members, and handle matters related to the establishment. Industrial and commercial trade associations are subject to the guidance and supervision of the central competent authority, and also subject to the guidance and supervision of the National General Association for Commercial Control.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the regulations regarding trade associations apply to industrial and commercial trade associations.</p>
<p>Original Article 22 and Article 23 remain unchanged, Article 24 remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wartime Housing Lease Dispute Resolution Law Passed by the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Regarding the wartime housing lease problem, landlords and tenants often have disputes due to rent increases and eviction, and even go to court. In order to resolve this dispute, the Ministry of Social Welfare drafted the Wartime Housing Lease Dispute Resolution Law, which was submitted and passed by the 219th meeting of the Executive Yuan on August 8th, and will be submitted to the Central Political Council for promulgation and implementation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Air Force Sinks Two Enemy Submarines; Japanese Forces on Omiya Island Invite Attacks and Heavily Damage Enemy Forces</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese naval air force sank one enemy submarine each in the waters southeast of Taiwan and near Oshima Island on the 9th. The enemy submarine sunk off Oshima Island was in the process of surfacing when it was attacked by a torpedo and sunk.</p>
<p>A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese garrison on Omiya Island has been inviting attacks from enemy forces near the eastern outskirts of Akashi Street and Mount Halta since the beginning of August, inflicting heavy damage on them. Afterwards, the battle line shifted to the north, and they are currently fiercely attacking the enemy forces in the northern mountainous area. Since the 7th and 8th, the battle lines of both sides have crossed, with localized fierce battles occurring everywhere.</p>
<p>A Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the main force of the Japanese army freely retreated from Guadalcanal, the remaining units engaged in guerrilla warfare in the area were immediately cut off from national economic support. Unexpectedly, after this unit recently captured an enemy torpedo boat, it obtained national economic support with the Japanese military base. It has now been determined that the entire unit is currently using the dense forest as a base and engaging in guerrilla warfare with the enemy. The national economic committee members on that side again rode a torpedo boat full of ammunition, amidst the cheers of the base garrison, and set off again towards Guadalcanal.</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Attacks Ganzhou Airport, Destroys Seven Chongqing-US Aircraft</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the Chinese front, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the dawn of the 9th, the Japanese bomber squadron raided the Ganzhou (between Zhejiang and Jiangxi) airport in Jiangxi Province, destroying seven Chongqing-US aircraft, and after severely bombing its military facilities, safely returned with all aircraft. The details of the operation are recorded as follows: At 3:30 AM that morning, Japanese aircraft invaded the airspace above the Chongqing military base in adverse weather, and carried out low-altitude bombing of the Chongqing-US aircraft under cover. Five small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two small aircraft and four vehicles were destroyed. At the same time, two locations that appeared to be fuel and ammunition depots were bombed, but no fire was seen. Because the Chongqing army in the area showed signs of retreat, there were only a few small aircraft at the airport, and because no fire was seen in the fuel depot, it was expected that all its materials had been withdrawn.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Aircraft Attacking Hengyang Suffer Losses of Nine Aircraft</h3>
<p>The local front line on the mainland, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) On the morning of the 8th, about 20 Chongqing P40 aircraft attacked Hengyang. The Japanese garrison on aerial patrol immediately invited the attack, and after a fierce battle, shot down seven Chongqing aircraft and destroyed two. In this battle, only three Japanese aircraft did not return. Again, in the afternoon of the same day, Japanese aircraft discovered about ten Chongqing P40 aircraft attacking over Xindi in southern Hubei Province, and shot down three Chongqing aircraft.

<p>Guangzhou, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) After the Japanese army captured Hengyang, the Chongqing army in Shaoguan, considering the harsh environment, moved all units under the Seventh War Zone to southern Jiangxi. The Chongqing provincial government authorities and their affiliated agencies have moved to nearby counties. The population of Shaoshi reached 500,000, but after the Chongqing army forcibly dispersed them, the civilians moved to other places in succession. All schools were closed on January 27th. Those who exceeded the deadline and did not leave the city were expelled and their national army identity cards were inspected at any time. To avoid forced expansion of military service, most young people voluntarily returned to peaceful areas. It now appears that the Shaoguan authorities intend to abandon the area. Currently, Shaoshi is desolate and has become a dead city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Continue to Attack Leizhou Peninsula</h3>

<h3>Registration of Banks in Nanjing to Be Handled Strictly</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) It was previously reported that the Ministry of Finance had stopped registering financial institutions in Nanjing. However, recently there have still been banks opening for business. The reporter specially visited the Ministry of Finance authorities, who provided the following information: The Ministry has already announced in a statement on December 18, 1942, that registration of financial institutions in Shanghai has been stopped. The Ministry has also approved that no new financial institutions are allowed to be established in Nanjing. Applications for the establishment of financial institutions submitted to the Ministry after April 1st of this year were all rejected. Those submitted before March 31st were still being processed according to the regulations. Recently, the banks mentioned in the press may have recently opened for business due to preparations, or are still in preparation, but their applications for establishment were submitted before the deadline. In addition, a small number of money shops, due to business reasons, applied to the Ministry for approval to change their names to banks and formally open for business again, and are not newly established financial institutions. Recently, it was also reported that various banks that have been approved by the Ministry but have not yet opened for business, due to their inability to operate, have taken the opportunity to stop registration and sell the bank licenses approved by the Ministry to others at high prices. There are even banks that have already gone bankrupt and are still selling their business licenses that should be destroyed, hoping to make a profit. This kind of illegal behavior is truly hateful. The Ministry is currently strictly investigating and will severely punish those who are found to be guilty. The Ministry has always strictly reviewed applications from existing banks to increase capital, change their names, or re-elect directors and supervisors. If the above-mentioned circumstances are discovered, they will be severely punished to prevent abuse.</p>

It is resolutely strengthening synthetic petroleum enterprises within the customs, and granting considerable production goals to the Fuel Company. Moreover, the relationship between the price of synthetic petroleum, which has always been a matter of great debate, and the war situation has recently been realized due to the urgency of oil supply. Therefore, the Fuel Company's direct management and increased capabilities in securing resources and funds, technical guidance and its exchange and common use, participation in production replenishment plans and material mobilization plans, etc., and other efforts to turn defeat into victory have been strengthened. The rest of the United Control has cooperated with the government to ensure the production of synthetic petroleum, and the Fuel Company has absorbed several existing companies as directly-managed manufacturing plants. In addition, it is also steadily establishing condensation function ceremonies for other powerful companies as targets. The new business model that has recently been realized is worthy of attention in the future for the supply of synthetic petroleum in North China.</p>

<h3>Offensive and Defensive Battles Unfold on the Border of East Prussia; Defenses in Central Germany Are Strong</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German military authorities announced the situation on various areas of the Eastern Front on the 9th as follows: In the Vistula River pocket area, Soviet forces launched another offensive to the north and east from the bridgehead on the west bank of the Vistula River. After fierce battles, they broke into several marching positions. The marching units immediately counterattacked, detouring to the flanks and deep into the rear of their vanguard, cutting off their retreat, and at the same time repelling the main force of the Soviet army. The battle at the Barga bridgehead was also very fierce. German armored vehicles, which had taken the initiative in the battle situation, began to fiercely attack to the east, and used blitzkrieg to compress the Barga bridgehead. The Soviet army southwest of Bialystok, on the eastern border of East Prussia, launched another large-scale armored offensive on the 8th. After fierce battles, they broke into several German positions. The German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, preventing their advance, and fierce battles are continuing. The German army from Swaruki to Neman blocked the Soviet army's attack, and the Soviet army failed to approach the border by one step. A major offensive and defensive battle unfolded on the 8th in the Rasenya area on the northeastern border of East Prussia. The Soviet army launched a large number of tanks and fiercely attacked the German army's positions on a narrow battle line. After several hours of sea battle, the German army withdrew from Rasenya, and then sent reinforcements for a fierce counterattack, and finally repelled the Soviet army in Rasenya.</p>

The German army's new defense forces have arrived in the central region one after another, forming a strong and immovable defense. The weapons and forces supplied from the rear are constantly flowing. I have full confidence in the loyalty and bravery of the German people.</p>
<h3>US Forces to Make New Landing in Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) Military editor of the Houtong News Agency, Setho Mus, said: Subtle signs show that the anti-Axis forces are preparing to land in Italy again. This matter will be presided over by the US Fifth Army, which has not been active on the Arno River line for a long time. Most of its defense zone has been taken over by the Eighth Army. The new landing is likely to be near the Gulf of Gulian, but in terms of geography, landing in the Adriatic Sea and the Adriatic Sea is more advantageous, because that area is the North Italian lowland, which can be used for large tank operations. On the Ligurian coast and Genoa, the mountains extend to the coast, making it difficult to secure a beachhead and difficult to advance north. There may be two reasons for the anti-Axis forces to land here: they hope to occupy the port of Genoa, and the German army's unexpectedly strong resistance on the Arno River line has prevented General Alexander from deciding whether to break through the German defense line from below.</p>
<h3>Germany Is Reviewing the Conscription of Women</h3>

<h3>Northern France Anti-Axis Forces Break into Rouen; Germans Begin Counteroffensive at Loire Estuary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Northern France battle situation on the 9th: Fierce fighting occurred on the Caen to Avreches front. A large Anti-Axis force, under the cover of tanks and air power, strongly attacked German positions. Their vanguard has broken into the Caen area and the general army positions south of Vire. However, they have now been completely halted. In other war zones, the Anti-Axis forces suffered heavy losses in positional warfare. The Axis forces' offensive from the front lines still has limited progress. Intense fighting erupted in the Rouen area on the 8th, with Anti-Axis forces breaking into Rouen city. The battle for Saint-Malo is particularly fierce.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 9th: German forces in the Brittany Peninsula have begun a counteroffensive from the Loire Estuary. Anti-Axis forces' claims of cutting off the Brittany Peninsula are untrue. The situation in that area remains unchanged. German forces in Brittany are seizing strongholds through assaults; therefore, American plans have ultimately failed. American offensives at Saint-Nazaire and Lorient have been thwarted. American forces in the Laval area and Sarthe have advanced eastward through German strongholds, but their advance is limited to a portion of the forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Reuters dispatch) - The German defense forces in Brittany have been consolidated into three major units for resistance: one in the Brest Peninsula, one in the Lorient area, and one in the Saint-Nazaire area. American tank units in Brittany have been replaced by infantry, and the tanks have been moved between the lower reaches of the Loire River and the Vilaine River. The redeployment is not yet complete. Enemy tanks have advanced from Maine to the Sarthe River, with a portion reaching Château-Gontier and engaging in street fighting. Currently, along the line of the River Oudon near Angers, while American forces have launched large-scale attacks, German forces have not launched large-scale counteroffensives. However, both sides are actively preparing for a major battle. The outcome will have a significant impact on the entire Western Front. In the area between Caen and the River Orne, American First Army, with the assistance of massive air power, barely avoided defeat. German forces not only held their original defenses but also made slight advances. The Canadian First Army's offensive southeast of Caen is fierce, but they are still between the Orne and the Caen-Falaise road. Enemy reinforcements continue to arrive, but they have not broken through. The Canadian forces were halted after advancing four kilometers, and it is expected that enemy pressure will continue to increase.</p>

<h3>New Japanese Cabinet's Policy Towards China Remains Unchanged; Ambassador Tani Meets with Press Corps and Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masanari, took the opportunity of his visit to Shanghai to meet with the Shanghai Chinese press corps at the Broadway Mansions Hotel on the afternoon of yesterday (10th) at 5:00 PM. He answered various questions from newspaper reporters and clarified that the new Japanese cabinet's policy towards China remains unchanged, and that Sino-Japanese relations are progressing gradually according to established plans. The meeting lasted for forty minutes. The record of Ambassador Tani's statement is as follows:</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani first clarified the purpose of his visit to Shanghai, which was to inspect the work of the personnel at the Shanghai office of the Japanese Embassy and to pay his respects to the Japanese naval commander in Shanghai. He then answered the various questions asked by the press corps in detail:</p>
<p>Decline in Rice Prices</p>
<p>The recent decline in rice prices in Shanghai is the result of the efforts of the National Government and the Rice Control Association, as well as the sincere cooperation of the Japanese side. Therefore, the price of rice will continue to decline permanently. Moreover, the new rice crop is about to enter the market, and it will definitely fall to a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Japan's new policy towards China is based on the original posture of the two countries. In the past, it was obstructed by the enemy British and Americans, which prevented Japan from achieving it. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan, from a position of moral principle, assisted China. This time, the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and a new cabinet was formed, which still adheres to the established policy of the past. Furthermore, the entire nation, both government and public, unanimously supports the key points of the new Sino-Japanese policy. For example, Minister Shigemitsu remains in his position as Foreign Minister and concurrently as Minister of Greater East Asia, and Minister Ishiwata remains in his position as Finance Minister. Therefore, Japan's policy towards China will absolutely not change. Moreover, there is no need to elaborate on specific issues. Japan is working hard in accordance with the established plans between China and Japan. For example, cooperation in politics and economy, and the recent measures regarding food rice, are all manifestations of the new policy. In addition, cultural exchanges will be even more closely promoted. China and Japan are currently progressing gradually according to established plans.</p>
<p>Economic Cooperation Regarding Japan's economic cooperation with China, such as in the agricultural field, the Chinese authorities already have a detailed plan. This year, due to favorable weather conditions, a bumper harvest is expected. I am very pleased about this. As for the industrial field, Japan will do its best to provide assistance. Advisor Ogura has specially returned to Japan to consult with the Japanese government and public, and I expect that there will be good and clear results after he returns to China soon. The recent cabinet reshuffle in Thailand is to strengthen cooperation in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. The new Prime Minister has a deep understanding of Greater East Asia, which is a great blessing for Thailand.</p>
<h3>Method for Moving Registered Rice in the Future: Report to the Economic Security Office for Verification</h3>
<p>In order to understand the quantity of rice stored in Shanghai, the Shanghai Commodity Distribution Office conducted a city-wide rice storage registration, which ended yesterday morning. When the Central News Agency reporter inquired about this matter with the relevant authorities yesterday, it was said that after the rice storage registration is terminated, rice shipped from outside the city to the city in the future should still be registered with the Commodity Distribution Office in accordance with regulations, and the office will then notify the Economic Security Office for verification. As for registered rice, if it needs to be moved, the buyer should report the facts to the Economic Security Office within three days, and the office will list them weekly and notify the Commodity Distribution Office for verification. If rice is stored in warehouses designated by the Municipal Government and needs to be moved out of the warehouse, a removal certificate should still be obtained from the Commodity Distribution Office as usual before it can be moved, in order to prevent abuses.</p>
<h3>Baojia Expenses to be Collected Regularly</h3>
<p>In view of the unification of Baojia administration in the city and in order to strengthen the close connection between the police and Baojia, the Baojia Office of the Shanghai Police Bureau convened a joint meeting of Baojia personnel above the level of Lianbaozhang in each district at Xianyao Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM yesterday (10th). The meeting was presided over by Gu Zongwu, the director of the Baojia Office, and Goto, the director of the Special Higher Police, also attended. The meeting was attended by the Zonglianbaozhang and Lianbaozhang of Huangpu, Laoza, Xincheng, Jiangning, Putuo, Jing'an, Taishan, Changshu, Lujiawan, Huashan, Changning, Xinshijie and other districts, as well as Baojia committee members Wang Boyuan, Wang Lianfang, Zhou Qiankang, Shen Siliang, Yu Zhijing, Zhou Mengbai, Chen Fukang, Le Fenglin, Luo Youlan, etc., and Ding Zhuo, secretary of the office, Chen Jiufeng, section chief, Xiao Gang, etc., totaling hundreds of people. Director Gu, as chairman, clarified the purpose of convening the meeting, and put forward issues such as Baojia expenses, the waste metal collection movement, and improving the issuance of residence certificates, hoping to discuss them together and solicit high opinions. Finally, he gave detailed instructions on the system of Baojia. Then, Secretary Ding explained the unified fee collection form, including the Baojia fee-paying household list, the Baojia fee-paying household increase/decrease report, the Baojia arrears list, the Baojia arrears recovery list, the Baojia fee collection report, and the Baojia arrears increase/decrease report, item by item. After the Baojia personnel in each district expressed their opinions successively, they began to discuss the date for collecting unified Baojia fees and the date for collecting the waste metal movement. After discussion, it was resolved that the collection of Baojia expenses would begin on August 15, with a fee of 10 yuan for attached households, 30 yuan for regular households, and 50 yuan for store households, collected for both July and August. Those who are extremely poor may apply for exemption. The collection accounts of each district must be completed by the end of August. The waste metal collection movement will begin on September 1.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of "Refugee" Paintings Extended</h3>
<p>The Jiang Zhaohe painting exhibition, organized by the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, Jiyi Society, and Shen Bao, etc., was held at the China Painting Institute on Jing'an Temple Road and was originally scheduled to end yesterday. However, because one of the works, "Refugee," is nine feet high and more than seventy feet long, vividly depicting the plight of human displacement, and won the sympathy of the audience, various circles have sent letters requesting an extension. It has been decided to extend the exhibition for three days from today, with no admission fee, and visitors are welcome.</p>

<p>Reader Scholarship News</p>
<h3>One is Delighted, One is Resentful: Same Enthusiasm, Opposite Results</h3>
<p>The list of students approved for scholarships this year, for elementary and junior high schools, was published on page four of this newspaper yesterday. This piece of paper with black ink is not major international news, nor is it a novel social event. It is just a dull list, lacking the value of close reading, nor will it arouse the reading interest of the general public. However, we firmly believe that at least 5,000 people or more, with extremely enthusiastic emotions and extremely tense heartstrings, will carefully read it from beginning to end, word for word, and even read it several times. At least 10,000 people or more, with the same mood, will carefully listen with their eyes open and ears pricked up. As a result, more than 2,000 people who read the list will see their names and a burst of involuntary joy will appear in their hearts. More than 5,000 people who listen carefully will hear the names of their children and will reveal a comforting excitement. This group of people is the students who applied for and were approved for scholarships and their families.</p>
<p>At the same time, at least more than 2,000 people will not see their names, and more than 5,000 people will not hear the names of their children, and they will feel pain, resentment, and tears. This group of people is the students who applied for scholarships and were not approved and their families. However, most of the students in these more than 2,000 students are also excellent in their academic performance. Therefore, those who were not selected were not because they did not meet the "poor and excellent" standard, but entirely because the amount of scholarship money we received was insufficient for distribution. Regarding this point, our sad mood is no less than that of the students who were not selected.</p>
<p>Now, our only hope is to request that you, the readers, especially the wealthy merchants, display a good intention, donate some money, and we can successively allocate aid to the students who were not approved. We are leaving space to publicize the benevolent spirit of the donating gentlemen, so that the society can admire them.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the investigation and verification of various primary and secondary schools, 600 copies of the approved student list have been printed. If schools need to request them, please use a note with a stamp and request them from the social service department of this newspaper.</p>
<p>Yuan Tai Company Generously Donates a Large Sum Yuan Tai Industrial Company Electrical Department generously donated 50,000 yuan yesterday, showing great enthusiasm for helping students, which is extremely admirable. The letter is recorded as follows: "To the Editor, since your newspaper has been handling scholarships, enthusiastic people in the society have responded and donated large sums to establish a great cause of cultivating talents, so that the outstanding children of ordinary families who cannot afford to study can continue their studies, benefiting the poor and rescuing those who have dropped out of school, which is deeply admired. Now we enclose 50,000 yuan in national currency, which we donate to your newspaper's scholarship fund. Please accept it. Although it is a meager contribution, it is enough to fulfill the duty that citizens should do." Others, such as Xincheng, donating 30,000 yuan, and Mr. Zhu donating 30,000 yuan from his funeral expenses to the scholarship fund, are all worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Thinking of the Source After Illness, Not Forgetting to Help Students</p>
<p>Chen Qixian, a student who has been assisted by this newspaper, wrote: "To the Editor, I have received scholarships from your newspaper twice, so that I can continue my studies and complete high school. Now, due to illness, I am temporarily resting. Feeling grateful, I would like to donate 500 yuan from my savings during my illness to your newspaper's scholarship fund to express my sincere gratitude. I hope you will accept it."</p>
