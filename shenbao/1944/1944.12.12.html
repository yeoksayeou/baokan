<h3>攻撃斯黎高海峽沉幫艦船八艘　日大本營發表丹心隊戰果</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　日大本營十一日下午三時三十分發表：日特別攻擊隊丹心飛行緻之六機，十二月十日攻擊雷伊泰島東南方斯黎高海峽敵運輸船團，獲得戰果如次：擊沉大型運轍船二艘，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦一艘，大型登陸用舟艇二艘，擊毀起火者大型輸船二艘，巡洋體或大型驅逐艦一艘，上述擊毀起火之巡洋艦或大型驅遂艦一艘，後遭日軍掩護戰鬥機擊沉。</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫日軍某基地十一日中央社電　九日雷伊泰方面天氣極爲惡劣，日軍航空部隊冒惡劣氣候，出動猛攻阿爾別拉上陸之敵軍部隊，予阿爾別拉附近之敵軍戰車·裝甲車等以相當損害。另一隊出動阿爾別拉及已帕·卡利巴拉等地，在阿爾別拉海面擊破敵軍登陸舟艇一艘，在答姆拉安地方聯炸掃射其物資堆棧一處，使共發火燃燒。</p>
<p>馬尼刺十一日中央社電　在阿爾別拉附近强行登陸之美軍，於受重大損害後，同時以戰車及裝甲汽車等隨同北上，進迫奧爾莫克，日軍守備部隊現正與之激戰中。又於阿爾別拉附近，日軍所在部隊亦正對敵登陸部隊繼續加以猛攻。又日軍航空部隊亦冒惡劣之天氣，協力地上部隊對敵軍痛個轟炸。</p>
<h3>雷島日軍佔領　布羅音機塲</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十一日中央社電　雷伊泰島敵最大空軍基地布羅音南北兩機塲，終於爲日本佔領，於茲敵軍在雷伊泰島作戰之主要目的，即設立有力空軍基地之企圖，遭逢一大挫折。允有甚者，布羅音之佔領，對雷伊泰島整個之陸上作戰，均有莫大影響，殊堪刮目而視。蓋敵軍自在菲律賓作戰之後，空母勢力遭受重創，對於空軍兵力之配置，發生一大漏洞以來，對於雷伊泰島唯一可以起落大型機之布羅音機塲，極力促進，傾其廟大之人員資材，努力建設，不幸未逞，而集合其所需要之機數，又爲日軍空陸一體之奇襲攻擊所佔領。據布羅音與塔克羅班，特拉克三地，聯合形成雷伊泰島野戰軍中樞陣地三角形之一端，敵軍深知該地之重要性與弱點，特在塔下密附近配備有力部隊，以謀侵入西山高地一帶，免除側面之威脅。但終無濟於事，總之，由於該機塲之失陷，雷伊泰島敵軍，整個均遭受莫大衝動。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十一日中央社電　日軍「空中神兵」之高千穗部隊，强襲聖巴布羅後，敵陣又陷入混亂狀態，據日軍陸地部隊之報告，七日晚布羅音南機塲及聖巴布羅機塲發生大火災。又於上月二十六日强行降陸之日軍空挺隊　部隊之一部，現仍健在，而且陸續活躍，敵第七師，第七十六師現已疲勞至極，戰意日衰，布羅音南北兩機塲，至九日仍在日軍手中。</p>
<h3>日機襲撃印度意義極重大</h3>
<p>東京十日中央社電　日航空部隊七日曾襲擊印度加爾各答西方之B29型機基地，於敵機猛烈抵抗中，對該地機場，加以痛烈打擊，並護得大本營所發表之戰果。按該次攻擊，意義極爲重大，因該處於印度及大陸B29型機之總數，不下四百內外，勢力極堪重視，彼等以印度之喀拉蒙爲空軍基地，而以加爾各答，錫蘭兩大根據地，然後相機以共一部進駐成都，以備進一步空襲日本九州，同時，兩月來於空襲滿州之外，更直接自印度基地進窺昭南，蘇門答臘，盤谷等各南方地域，並與太平洋之菲島戰相呼應。又隨緬甸戰綫之突然緊急進展，其行動更趨活潑化，同時，太平洋敵馬利亞那基地，連日遭日軍猛攻，故結果比較安全之基地，唯有加爾各答基地而已。但日軍航空部隊此次空襲，已實證今後可以隨時威脅該地，即B29準機之基地，亦莫不皆有隨時這日軍襲擊之危險。</p>
<p>緬甸前棧日軍某基地十日中央社電　日軍緬甸方面航空部隊之夜問轟炸隊，七日未明在下弦月明亮下，長驅轟炸印度心臟部密得那浦爾之敵軍第二十轟炸機塲，加爾各答西方一七零公里附近之B29機塲，日機在敵軍對空砲火之閃爍下，相繼進入機塲上空，投下炸彈，燒燬敵機五架，予其他施設以重大損害，使四處發生大火，全機安然返防</p>
<h3>爪哇成立　造船挺身隊</h3>
<p>爪哇十一日中央社電　爪哇造船局爲期急速完成運輸工作，現特成立造船挺身隊，此挺身隊計分造船及造機兩班，遇有必要時，並得分派於全哇各造船及造機工塲，隊員皆爲具有經騐之技術者，此等技術者之活躍，極堪期待。</p>
<h3>渝美機襲香港被撃毀兩架</h3>
<p>東京十一日中央社電　美駐渝空軍八日上午九時四十分左右，以P57型機數架侵入香港地區，但被日方撃毀二架，即行</p>
<h3>內地來人談重慶困難重重　軍事指揮不能統一</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據最近甫由四川內地來人談稱，川省人民對美國壓迫重慶，憤懣反對，並特派張瀾代表，向蔣介石提出建議，促蔣尊重中國自治獨立，同時減少民衆痛苦。蔣接得該建議書時，深爲驚異，立即調查此項舉動有何背景。結果始悉爲××軍人在幕後唆使策動所致，刻正縝密加以研究。查張瀾前任西川省省長，後任成都大學校長。</p>
<p>渝方軍權不能統一　渝方在廣西作戰失敗原因，重慶大公報特發表論文，追討根源，大意稱：重慶最高司令部之命令，與戰區指揮官之命令不一致，遂致失敗。茲據談，所謂渝最高司令部命令，由軍事委員會所發表，而當地戰區指揮官命令，則由美國參謀團所發表，彼輩不經過渝政權，直接由當地總指揮所擅發，以致參差不統一。</p>
<p>重慶難民滿坑滿谷如今湖南廣西流浪內地之難民，擁擠不下六十萬人以上。渝方雖派逍汽車火車載運，亦感不敷之苦。過去貴陽人口的在二十萬人，今已達三十萬人以上。過慶過去人口的九十九萬人左右，今已超逾一百二十五萬人以上。頃聞該二都市已作防制艱民入境之措置。在該地難民，寄宿於公會倉庫學校等公共塲所，滿坑滿谷，且沿途此比皆是，同時一般人對當地救濟工作大表不滿。尤以難民激增，致使物價交通費之黑市驟貴。例如貴陽赴重慶，長途汽車票價原定六千元，黑市達四萬餘元，即如僱駛貨車，每日取價三十萬元</p>
<p>渝方派員救濟難民　廣東十一日中央社電當忙於軍隊之補充及戰綫擴大，其救濟難民已成重大問題。據重慶電，軍事委會政治部國民黨社會部，爲共同担當此種工作，已派工作人員三百名，分赴四川之綦江廣元璧山，貴州之遵義等地。又據福建永安消息，該省振濟委員會，兩日來救濟沿海難民及學校敎員學生總數，已達八千名之多。</p>
<h3>日機隊再襲遂川機場</h3>
<p>大陸基地十一日中央社電　日轟炸機隊，九日夜空襲遂川塲，冒熾烈之防空砲火，猛撃機塲停留之飛機及附屬設施，大型機二架，小型機一架，中彈起火。並炸毀機型不詳者二架，及軍事設施，日機安然歸返。</p>
<h3>京日居留民　開決戰大會</h3>
<p>南京十一日中央社電　十一日下午六時至八時，日海軍協會及興亞報國會，聯合假本京東和劇塲，舉行日本居留民決戰大會，幷請由滬來京之日海軍報道部長松島大佐講演。準時開會後，首光演奏軍樂，繼由海軍協會南京支部長田中總領事致詞畢，由松島報道部長講演，語多勗勉，聽者動容，最後幷開映電影。</p>
<p>海軍協會今日開會　南京十一日中央社電日本海軍協會爲紀念大東亞戰爭三週年，定十二日上午九時，假國際俱樂部舉行紀念茶會，招待國府長官及中日新聞界。屆時有松島報道部長之演講及電影等。</p>
<h3>龍州等地民衆積極協助日軍</h3>
<p>河內十一日中央社電　自越南南進攻之日軍，已佔領龍州明江寗明等地，各當地之住民，已陸續歸來，到處飛揚擁護南京政府之旗幟。廣西省國境一帶前駐屯之渝軍第一八八師，曾徵發民間食糧，故當日軍進攻時，民間毫未協力渝軍。日軍則一反其所深惡者，於個別領後，對住民使其安居樂業，故彼等均積極協力日軍。</p>
<h3>越督府舉行首次評議會</h3>
<p>河內十一日中央社電　越南總督府最高諮問機關越南評議會，業於本月一日成立，九日於總督官邸舉行第一次會議，由德古總督主席，就當前經濟問題交換意見。</p>
<h3>英太平洋艦隊弗拉塞任統帥</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　海通社引倫敦消息；英當局昨晚宣布，任命弗拉塞海軍大將爲英國太平洋艦隊總司令，按弗氏現年五十六歲，原任東南亞英艦隊司令。鮑華海軍中將被任爲東印度兵站司令，丹尼爾海軍少將則被任英太平洋艦隊副司令</p>
<h3>日軍將在華南　展開次期戰　陳誠對外記者團談話</h3>
<p>里斯本十一日中央社電據重慶電，渝新任軍政部長陳誠，九日初次會見外國記者，就華南戰局、發表談話如次：無論從任何方而觀察，日軍均不得不準備再度展開次期作戰，日軍之目標，在完全掌握粤漢綫，在完全確保中國大陸與法屬越南間之陸路交通，更乘貴州省內渝軍兵力之不足，轉其銳鋒指向貴州，目下正於距離貴陽百十公里點進出。陳誠并言及改革渝軍及與美國協力問題，其要旨如次：渝軍無力與日軍作戰，爲衆知之事實，故吾人不得不將此無力之渝軍，加以强化與改革。</p>
<p>實行軍事第一政策　里斯本十一日中央社電　渝軍當局爲打開目前軍事危機，邇來拼命重視軍事方面，據當地消息，代理行政院長宋子文曾言明如下：常此危機緊迫之際，常首先處理軍事問題，政府之一切措置，亦在援助軍部之對日戰鬥</p>
<h3>戰爭三週年之感想　松平情報部長廣播演辭</h3>
<p>軍需生產減低六成　「據十一月中旬戰時補給部長蘇馬維在CTD大會中演說，軍需品生產平均已減至計劃量之六成，同月二十八日美陸軍部發表，艾森霍華歐洲派遣軍爲催促美國急送武器彈藥起見，曾派遣二十七名將校赴本圖，分五組歷訪各軍需工塲，强調軍需之增產，何以美國之軍需生產平均減低計劃量之六成，此終究係由於二千億美元龐天預算所產生之通貨膨脹之影響。如稍加說明，則因由於和平產業改爲軍需產業，致一般物資漸減，及由於戰綫擴大戰爭苛烈化之消耗物資顯著增大，故生活必需物資亦急告缺乏。據片斷之情報，例如在芝加哥本年七月間任何商店，不能獲得白塔油，在洛杉磯則菜館九百家食糧品店一百家倒閉，牛乳之配給則減少五成，白塔油則減少六成，因物資之不足，自早晨排隊買物者絡繹不絕。</p>
<p>物資缺乏影響生活　又最近購買得平與上海情形相同，亦排隊購買，而軍隊已無香烟之配給矣。農產物之價格雖無統制，因本年度小麥收穫之激減，故每人一餐，平均不得不減少二成，雖稱世界第一之小麥生產國而輸互量於外國之國家，本年每人一餐減少二成，此種情形乃爲一向未曾想像到者。因此物資豐富之美國，今物資之抽乏亦已達山窮水盡之狀態，通貨膨脹促進物價之高漲，結果工資亦不得不增加，因資本家之抑壓，故同盟罷工及意工頻發，自然促使生產滅少。另一方面欲由價格統制之軍需產業，改爲價格無統制之和平產業者層出不窮，政府對此亦不能制，故七月以來已許可人民經營七十二種類之和平產。現軍需生產業已告激減，自十二月份起又有一百二十大都市採取停止恢復和平產業之措置，暴露政府之無能，彼等首腦部所犯之錯誤，由以上之現象暴露無遺」。</p>
<p>我人之英美觀</p>
<p>翻過來吾人所作之英美觀究屬如何，吾等東洋人之想法，爲依據直接觀感而得者，已如適才之所述。余以爲在三年前之十二月八日日本決定其最後方策止，悉由所有各方面加以分折，根據數字統計等爲參考而建立科學基礎加以判斷，更冷靜的考慮國家之將來，毫無邪念存在於純潔坦白之心境下，直接感念到國家運命·據此綜合的判斷而決定國家大計者。余認爲於一切事物之推想中，究以直接感觸者爲合理，抑以科學限光推論而得者較爲合理，此問題極難斷定。吾人雖不能決定何方絕對優良絕對合理，然至少由直接感觸，且經科學眼光推想者最合於理想，於此意義下一，吾人則兼有兩而之觀感，旣有直接感觸者同時亦具有科學的眼光。</p>
<p>傾舉總力爭取勝利　自瓜達爾卡納爾敵軍反攻以來，日本對於敵人之觀察益告正確，具有上下一致之見解，但敵目前尚未淸楚認識日本之正體對於其本國民衆之指導亦支離滅裂，尤其在美國或揑造日本實力已告減弱之虛僞戰績，向國民宣傳日本之弱自國之强，而陸海軍則向國民宣傳日本之難以侵犯，竭力鼓吹增强戰力，此爲敵之弱點，凡一切之信念由直感而生者，始爲眞正之信念，吾人在吾人之武器中，具有精神與信念，而具有作戰之素質較之敵人有最優秀之點，因吾人以此自信，對於來臨之決戰第四年，非傾吾所有之精神與物質之全力，而獲得最後勝利之光榮不可。（續完）</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>民爲貴（上）</h3>
<p>國家是由土地，人民，主權三種構成的，三種中缺了一種，就不能成爲國家，其中最重要的是人民，因此，一個國家的政治設施，皆以人民的利害爲歸趨，所以古代聖賢說的「民爲邦本，本固邦寗」，不僅是中國數千年來的政治原理，也成爲中國民衆的政治哲學了。所謂「得民者昌，失民者亡」，就是國家的政治施策，是否到得民衆的擁護。</p>
<p>中國民衆的習慣，並不把國家與政府作二位一體的看待，有時竟看作絕然兩橛的東西，所以人民對於政府，向抱選擇態度。但是由於中國人過分沉着堅忍的習性，對政府的選擇，却又不如何積極。對於十分心悅誠服的政府，始表現一些熱忱，對於十分深惡痛絕的政府，則奮起革命，不惜「及汝偕亡」；對於還沒到十分深惡痛絕的政府，他們是抱着放任態度，事先不向政府要求民權，來糾正政府的錯誤，彈劾政府的不當，一直到十分深惡痛絕的程度，奮起革命，「及汝偕亡」。中國數千年來政治上的一治一亂，都沒離開這種規律。國父創造三民主義，有歷史根據的。</p>
<p>由此，我們可以明白，中國的政府與人民之問劃着一條鴻溝，塡塞這條鴻溝的人，是「學而優則仕」的士大夫階級。（今謂知識分子）因爲中國一般文化水準的低落，知識分子成了社會的中堅力量，視爲「草上之風」。而民衆對於政府的選擇，是以他們的去向爲去向，歷史上大的革命運動，知識分子起領導作用，已成爲鐵證。假如社會中堅的知識分子，也不正視民衆的利益，亦即全民族的利益，倒在一邊，祗照顧自已的私利，與民衆爲敵，則無異加速民族的危亡，擴大了政府與人民之間的距離。</p>
<p>這樣，我們更可以明自，惟有政府的一舉一動，莫不爲國家謀利益，人民謀幸福，自己振作，推誠相與，使人民「心悅誠服」，關心政治，有如關心目已私事，纔算是代表人民利益的政府。政府有人民的支援，政黨然後才有存在的地位。政黨決不會在無人民擁護基礎的政府中發展起來。</p>
<p>這些，都不是高深的政治理論，是一個現代國民的起碼政治常識，也是一個政府領導人民走上現代國家的基本原則。最近讀到國民然方面發表的默要文件，一個是六屆中執會臨時全會爲汪主席逝世發表宣言；一個是爲奉行主席遺志告全國民衆書。國民黨是中國最大的政黨，是領導建設新中國的執政黨，她的言論，是中國政治的方向，也是一般民衆努力的指標。因此，凡是中國人都應重視，尤其是擔負着民間興論的責任者，更應重視，而站在民衆立塲上來擁護這兩個重要文告。同時，應以民衆立塲來表示民衆的意見。上述幾點起碼政治理論，即是我們表示意見的基本觀點。</p>
<p>宣言和告民衆書，詞意懇切，立透闢，使民衆得一深刻印象，覺得國民黨充滿着振作氣槪，根本精神是要繼承國父遺敎和主席遺志，完成和平建國，貫澈三民主義的革命精神，對外申明反共反英美帝國主義之決心，始終協力完遂戰爭，爭取共存共榮，對內要求統一黨國，對今日渝方所處之困境，予以同情諒解，提出「黨不可分，國必統一」的原則。更表示「今者汪先生棄吾人而長逝矣，吾人不憂共產之不可撲滅，惟恐本黨同志之不能團結，不憂帝國主義政策之不可抗，惟恐革命努力之日就渙散，…」寥寥數語，足以表白南京國民黨同志坦直的胸襟，而能促成徘徊猶豫於渝方同志的醒悟，是無置疑餘地。在內政問題上，指出：「官僚制度爲消磨革命精神障碍」，「貪汚政治爲直接擾害民生，間接製造赤禍之毒素」。又說：「戰爭期間生活困苦固所難免，然游匪肆虐，破壞生產，奸商囤積，操縱居奇，苛雜盤剝，吸血吮脂，皆爲人爲的痛苦。」接着說凡此「本黨必悉力以行之，務使一字一句，見諸實現。」簡言之，即對外求獨立，必先統一黨國，對內求統一，必先安定民生。然後能「凡我同志暨我同胞，務須仰體斯旨，遵守總理遺敎，奉行主席遺志，無貳心，無歧途，勇猛精進，以底於最後之成功。」建設以三民主義爲根本的新中華民國。</p>
<p>誠然，世變日亟，國民黨同志所負使命愈重，凡我同胞所擔責任也愈大，需要解決的問題也愈多愈複雜。不問責任如何重大，問題如何複雜，根本要着祗有一個，就是政府不離開民衆，站在民衆前頭領導，不面對着民衆。政治上所以造歲今日「人民痛苦深矣」的因素，其根源出於「負各方面之責者或以官吏生活困苦略近瞻循，或以僚屬過去勳勞，原情減罪，循至吏治日壞，政務不修。……」其結果是「官僚制度爲消磨革命精神障礙」，「貪污政治爲直接擾害民生，間接製造赤過之毒素。」政府方面的領導者，在民衆面前檢討過去政治上的缺點，坦白承認應得之責，下決心改革與民更新，這種政治家風度，値得欽佩！可是，問題再逼近一層來看，則又覺得「瞻循」「原情」還是外因。根源的根源，是黨政人員中間一些和平運動者，對於和平信念不堅定，沒有澈頭澈尾的精神，甚至誤認目前是過渡時代，於是利用機會，作混水撈魚的勾當，憑藉職位，以行利令智昏之舉，結果言行不一致，不知爲國，只知爲己。</p>

<h3>蘇法簽訂同盟條約</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十一日中央社電　據莫斯科廣播：特戈爾及外長畢達爾此次訪問莫斯科，係表現加貫兩民族同情心之多種顯示，而其因戰事中兩民族所受之經騐，對此同情心亦有所加强。此次會談，蘇方係由斯達林議長及莫洛托夫外長主持一切，關於作戰行動·和平組織及對德問題，均在討論之列。兩政府一再所着重於戰勝德國之決心及其共同採取必要措施，以保衛歐洲使某免於再受侵略之意願，亦因此而得以完成。基於此種決定之精神，兩政府遂於十二月十日簽訂同盟及互助協定，即將由雙方分別公布。</p>
<p>英法亦將訂立協定　瑞典京城十中央社電海通社訊，倫敦息：蘇法間同盟與互助條約成立後，英法間亦將簽訂協定，以完成英蘇法問之三角友誼。倫敦各報歡迎蘇法間之條約稱，此的與英蘇間之協定性質類似，此不但對繼續作戰甚爲重要，即於平時亦然。</p>
<h3>洪南部德軍克復三要城</h3>
<p>柏林十一日中央社電　海通社訊，布達佩斯之戰，德洪軍抵抗已見加强，北方薩軍佔領韋森後，尚無進展，該處所集之蘇軍，僅有一部份欲進攻洪京而已，另一隊則向斯洛伐克邊界推進，顯欲切斷德軍交通。洪京西南之蘇軍現向洪京進迫，德軍正在猛抗中，有時且予反攻。普拉登湖南，德軍已克復凱塞萊，馬克沙里及巴拉頓三城。</p>
<h3>三國戰後交通</h3>
<p>日內瓦十一日中央社電　德國社訊；目下在倫敦舉行之英美蘇戰後交通會議中，三國代表各爲其本國於歐洲交通制度，爭奪優厚之權益，非僅美蘇代表已發生意見衝突，即英美間亦有齟齬，英美雖同意於統一管理，但蘇方則對此議，而主張交通綫應擴大至蘇聯邊境。</p>
<h3>蕯爾前綫血戰四畫夜　美軍新戰術遭遇挫折</h3>
<p>西錢德軍總司令部十一日中央社電　海通社訊：薩爾前綫自曼齊格至薩爾勃魯根長的五十公里，戰事愈益激烈，巷戰之緊張，爲亞琛戰後所僅見。戰事重心在狄林根，激戰已歷一百餘小時。巴頓將軍第一次採取爭奪齊格斐防綫之新戰術，派出小股坦克車及工兵潛入各段，企圖破壞其間之交通聯絡，敵軍在狄林根作戰遭遇挫折，突入之特務隊被德軍包圍切斷。</p>
<p>成爲美軍第二墳墓　薩爾區之第二戰事重心，在下薩爾勞頓之艾恩賽爾間，美軍企圖擊潰德陣地，被德密集砲火所擊退。自亞琛之戰後，薩爾之戰誠可謂爲美軍之第二墳墓。薩爾猶寗與哈格諾間之激戰，與薩爾之戰亦有關係，但美第七軍亦不獲輕易進展。美軍進攻哈格諾城，其先頭部隊已進抵畢希維勒，德軍現在反攻中。亞琛區方面戰事無重大變化，德軍自於則退出育里許附近之羅爾橋頭堡後，該河現已成爲兩軍對峙之主要戰綫。</p>

<h3>武漢旅情（一）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>十一月三日，冒着毛毛的細雨，我坐的飛機，在漢口飛機塲降落了。正如坐落在黃浦江沿岸的上海一樣，而漢口也是坐落在揚子江沿岸。等於上海楊樹浦的地方，是日本租界，等於公共租界的地方，是法租界和英租界。等於浦東的是武昌，等於南市的是漢陽城。武漢是）我的陌生地，所以下了飛機就跳上黃包車，按照別人告訴我的道路，就向上海蘇成德先生所介紹給我的黃陂路地方的蔣先啓先生府上去了。我眞有點疏忽，在交換名片之前，竟不知蔣先生有陸軍中將的頭銜。談起中將來，則按日本規矩說，像我這樣沒有一官半職的一介白丁，是不能隨便訪問的偉大人物，如要求見，則非遭受兩三次碰壁或經過幾度轉達，是不易見到的。但蔣先啓先生雖有中將頭銜，但不是那樣令人望而生畏的人，而是和靄地立刻和我會面的。中國人的這種態度，或許就是外國人所說的中國式民主主義。道並不是說，中國的目前政治是民主主義。非常令人驚奇，中國縱有此日本更根深蒂固的封建殘餘習慣，然而社會生活方面却充滿着比日本更加濃厚的民主主義氣氛。曾有一個中國人對我說過，接近日本人時總覺毛骨悚然者，無非是日本人所具有的那種令人望而生畏的嚴肅態度所致。總而言之，中國並沒有階級性的社會禮節阻撓着普通人和「高貴」人直接接觸的機會，所以中國人間，都有相互直接接談的環境。而日本人間就沒有這種環境，爲了結交日本人只好先請喝酒。當酩酊大醉忘掉階級禮貌時，才會流露出人類的本性來。三杯沒有下肚的日本人相互間，常初次會面時，正像街頭巷尾上一條雄犬和一條雄犬相遇時一樣，必先用嗅覺試探對方的强弱，以小心翼翼的警戒態度來接近。而中國人與中國人初次見面時，則恰恰相反，正像一條雄犬在路傍發見了一條雌犬一樣，遠遠地就搖着尾巴走向前去，全身都表示着和靄可親的態度。我在中國人間已經住了十年之久，這種親切意味深深地浸透了我的靈魂，此次蔣先生的全家，也是衷心喜悅地歡迎我。我正好像一羣雄犬包圍着的一條雌犬，周圍全充滿着和靄可親的氛圍。這天晚上我非常快活，坐着蔣先生的車，就到四民路的德明飯店去了。</p>
<p>光明</p>
<p>漢口一星期來沒有電燈。聽證雨一直繼續落了一個星期。又冷又暗，無法提起精神來，只好提前一睡了之，但在這個時候，一位年青的文化人宋落紅却來訪我於旅次。大搖大擺地走向我睡覺地方來的這位年靑人，使我心中非常高興。宋先生說，我所寫的文章，大受武漢人所歡迎。我告訴他，一個外國人的文章在中國受到了歡迎，這不是一件好事；假如中國人能自由評述本國一切的時代到來時，則像我所寫的不三不四文章，就會被人遺粟的，我衷心盼望那樣時代的早日到來。宋先生聽到我這一篇言論，似乎想不出適當的回答來，只是默默地凝視着我的面孔。</p>
<p>宋先生走後，由於他鄉作客一時不易入睡，所以便在黑暗中獨自開始凝想了，墻壁上浸透着濕氣的旅館房間，頗似太古時代的穴居生活，非常黑暗。沒有光明的世界，的確可怕。在這個世界上一有人類，一定上神就賜與了火。近來我曾讀過世界聞名的北京人類學者裴文中博士，在「中國學報」上所發表的四十萬年前生存的北京原人生活記錄，裏邊說，北京原人曾相互捕殺呑食，甚至這樣人類還在洞穴中有點着火的形跡。那或許不是燒東西用的。因爲他們非常恐懼黑暗，就藉以取光。當時人類的死敵就是具有刀劍一樣牙齒的巨大動物「劍虎」。牠們往往從黑暗中冷不及防地襲擊北京原人，用其銳利的牙齒一戳，則人的頭蓋骨就出現一個大的洞。當時對抗敵人只能投石，而無其他武器的北京原人，對抗劍虎的唯一防禦法，就是在自已居住的洞內燒起火來。猛獸特別懼怕光明，因而北京原人勉强免於劍虎之難。現在的中國人，幸無劍虎之難，但所不能徼倖避免者，却是「囤虎」之災。有人說，「中國人的苦命是與生俱有的」，北京原人和現代中國人，在生活中都充滿着災難。爲規避這種災難，我們就需要燃燒起理性之火來。——就是這樣沉思中，終於渡過武漢的第一夜。</p>
<p>中國人的生活力</p>
<p>吃過早飯，冒着細細的雨，而到街上散步去了。在上海時聽說，漢口幾乎每天都在美國飛機的轟炸中，但市內却看不到轟炸的痕跡。在轟炸的地方，進行緊急修理，人們仍然像以前一樣，在該處快活地渡着生活。中國人像雜草般，生活力極强，縱你如何踐踏，如何蹂躪，仍然還會爬起來，這眞是不可思識的生活力。我一邊走着，一邊想中國人的神秘生活力之本體究竟是什麼？不知不覺邁進市塲雲集的人羣裏。中國早晨的集市，從南端到北端，全都是一樣的忽忙。人們總是希望以盡量少的錢，買到可能多而且香的食物，而在精神百倍地「討價還價」着·我看到一位太太想從老漁翁那裏買一尾大鯉魚。老漁翁討五百元；而太太還三百元，距離差得太遠。老漁翁說，近來天天下雨，不能打魚，最少四百五十元，再低一個銅板也不幹。我以爲四百元總可以成交，但始終不成。突然，我聯想到西班牙大文豪布拉斯克·伊巴尼資（Blascolbanez）所寫的一篇短文。內容就是四五天未能捕魚的漁失，帶着十三歲的兒子到海面上去釣金槍魚。費了九牛二虎之力，終於釣鈎上掛到了一條大金槍魚，經過了半小時聚精會神的拖拉，才能把魚弄到船上來。回頭一看，在船中兒子失踪了。聚精會神與魚鬥爭的期間，自己的兒子失足落海，隨着狂濤怒浪的漂流，而消逝了。　漁夫默默不言地獨自划着舟，返回海水冲打着的陸地。漁夫三言兩語告訴了來迎接的妻，而妻只是默默不言地悲痛起來。漁夫却不希奇被海水奪去了兒子。當時該夫婦嘆息着兒子的死，就與城市魚店裏來收買魚的人，大聲喧嚷地爭論價錢了。商人盡量想用賤儷購買魚，而該夫婦則因兒子的死所給與的刺微，決不負氣地想盡可能高價賣出。但知道這條金槍魚的眞正價格者，恐怕只有付出兒子生命代價的漁家夫婦吧！我在腦海裏同想着伊巴尼資的「漁夫」故事，而出神地望着這位老漁翁的面孔。是一副中國到處都有的平凡的，善良的「老百姓」的而孔。在他面孔的皺紋當中，同然不敢斷定是否有一個兒子被淤擊隊拖去的表情，是否有因戰火而全家四零五散的「悲痛」，但在其默默中很明顯地可以看出，爲了維特最低限度的生活，而有一步不肯退讓的鬬爭熱火，可以看出只有被迫到最低生存綫上者所具有的堅强生活力·我想這或許就是一般人所認爲神秘的中國人生活力的本體。中國無處不是徬徨於最低生存綫上的貧苦人羣。這樣的人們，無論自己的故鄉受到如何的砲轟，無論自己的家園怎樣破壞得片瓦無存，也都不能離開自己的鄉土一步。離開自己的土地，對於這類人就等於自殺。因此，墻壁坍塌了，上泥土；房頂露洞了，覆麥桿，仍然還是住下去，這就是中國人死守着自己家鄉的情景。－－我這樣心中想着，而又凝視老漁翁的而孔。此時的雨，仍然不停地下着。</p>
<p>鹽</p>
<p>漢口城裏有兩三處鹽政局的倉庫。早晨用載重汽車向他處運時，風從望湧地就跑來一羣窮人撮拾散落的鹽粒。遺落在馬路上的一粒鹽，也不能放棄地連泥帶土撮拾起來。漢口的鹽，就是這樣重視的高貴品。湖南湖北一帶，鹽是最大的問題。據說，鄉間僱一天短工，有用一把鹽作報酬的。像日本那樣燭圍全是海的國家，鹽簡直像空氣那樣的便宜，所以從未想到鹽還會成爲問題。屠格湼夫（Turgnreff）的散文詩中曾講過，俄國某一個地主太太，去訪問突然死去一個兒子的佃農，看見死掉兒子的母親，瀕瀕喝剩下的菜湯，於是大發雷霆地說：「你在死去兒子的悲痛當中，還能大喝菜湯哪！」佃農的母親回答說：「太太的話同然對，但因這盌菜湯內有鹽呵！」凡是不知鹽在俄國如何寳貴和重要的人，是不曉得這故事意義的。淚的主要成份是鹽，窮人如沒有鹽，是哭也哭不出來的．不知鹽之可貴的地主太太，自然無法瞭解佃農的眞正悲哀。希臘哲學家說過：「唯其悲，而不哭，唯其哭，而不悲」，所以「悲哀」這種情感，對於不能哭的農民說，成許是過份的。</p>
<p>往昔羅馬曾有一個用鹽代替貨幣的時代。英文稱鹽爲「Ｓalt　」，德文爲「Saltz」，羅馬兵士因爲不領餉銀而領鹽，所以餉銀稱爲Salary，兵士稱爲Soldier或Saldat。但在中國，尤其湖北，鹽固屬不是貨幣，但有貨幣更可寳貴的價値，是人民的生命。我曾問過一個人說：「貨幣可以把使用它的人引向邪道，那末鹽怎樣呢？」回答說：「鹽是防腐用的，但在中國是使人腐化的」。聽說漢口，現在因爲鹽又發生后大椿第二的事件了。</p>

<h3>防空雖見進步　強化尚待努力　防空本部評論訓練成績</h3>
<p>上海市民防空本部，對於本月九日防空訓練成績，發表評論如下：</p>
<p>一般防空訓練，到處均見進步，無論中日外籍，人人熱誠參加，本部深爲感佩，其中華人之進步，尤堪驚異，女性方面亦自動參加，足使向來對於華人之觀念，爲之一變，井足證明新新中國國民真能與日本同生共死，令人感　異常，但有一部分民眾，仍乏實際上之體騐，而多非實用之行動與準備。茲就各個事項，加述如左：</p>
<p>設施資材</p>
<p>資材設備多感不足，樣子爲數尤少，甚至於橫檔不全者，且梯下　　，梯檔　　等防險設備，爲數絕少，猝視之下，令人悸恐無已。防空壕設備，亦須晝增加，蓋防空壕在實際空製時至爲可靠。所以防空帽，多數僅具形式，爲一層薄布所裝，如上次空製時所見高射砲彈片紛墜時，決離濟事，故縱無鐵帽可戴，亦須在帽內厚填絲棉等物，使垂至肩部，以資防護。</p>
<p>待避演練</p>
<p>有俯臥于道路中者，此不能對背後加以防護，且必受機槍掃射而受傷，故爲立刻選擇利用地形或地上物計，平常行路時，應考慮如何選定待避塲所，行人亦須積極參加演練爲理想。</p>
<p>消防準備</p>
<p>僅對一部份灌水，而對大規模之灌水或防止延燒，尚未能注意，再僅注重水桶之傳　，而疏忽迅速確實之各個灌水演練者，亦爲數甚多。水之補給一般極少，用該大量之水，實際上不能消火，故對貯水地，防火用水糟之增加，不斷貯水，及預防冬季凍結等，俱應努力，又幫浦平均極爲少數，其使用方法，亦欠完善，須銘記消火係民防空消防之要義，故應更加注意操作準備。</p>
<p>救護工作</p>
<p>繃帶之捲法，三角巾之使用法，止血法等，大都頗爲笨拙，故須加緊演練，再有在火災近側或在防火活動通路實行緊急救護，此應再考慮設法，將其運至小馬路後加以施救。</p>
<p>工作情形，此均未十分注意，且僅爲模仿開掘救出工作而已，器具之準備極少，須預想電線電力線等危險物水道煤氣之破壞，而加緊準備演練。</p>
<p>指導運用</p>
<p>活動不切實際之處，大都因指導尚未臻完善，時時刻刻變化之狀態，須訊速予以顯示，井教以急速應變之處置方法，苦味指導得其法，則防火救護及工作諸演練當能行之相當逼真，現在中日外編成防火救護各班，俟防空區完成，當考慮各國人之物技，人數，智識程度，與年齡等，試行以日本人編成防火班，中國人編成工作班，外人編成救護班，而渾然之綜合態勢，至設備財一　，固　困難，然協力發揮最高能力，尚　指導者加以再編成也。</p>
<p>燈火管制</p>
<p>警戒管制尚稱良好，灭　　光設備因尚不完全，仍有數處洩光於外，移入空製管制，均須三分　之時間，就一般言，成績頗爲良好，但尚有四五十　洩露燈光，此等光線已可給與敵機攻擊之絕好目標，故必須加緊努力改善，　租界地區成績不佳，蘇州河以北地區雖大概良好，惟井非盡善盡美。故務須更加注意，一般　　及　店之管制設備不　，成績異常惡劣，必須特予注意，但　七時開始之警戒管制，稍稱良好。</p>
<p>工廠防空組織尚未充分　於增強與安定民生，擔任防護重要生產部門之防護　，仍未設置，殊蜀遺憾。</p>
<h3>市警察局　人事異動</h3>
<p>本市警察局老閘分局長賀德惠，因調京供職，故呈請辭職，爲經照准，遺缺暫由副局長有田後治代拆代行，又督察處獎懲督察室主任督察長三等警監姚宗瑞，服務三十餘年，頗著功績，亦經於上月呈准辭職。</p>

<h3>朱季華書畫展追記</h3>
<p>— 梧庵</p>
<p>禹川朱季華先生近爲浙紹醫院籌款，上周中舉行書畫展於中國畫苑，出口凡三百餘件，書畫各半，一面爲公益事謀進展，一方面爲國粹藝術作提倡，用意至善，實可不言而喻。</p>
<p>宋先生畫以花卉竹石梅蘭爲多，間作佛畫，意境用筆，深獲靑藤白陽遺韻，其出色處有南田之超逸，而去其麗，得復堂之奔放，而去其廣，此種格高意簡之藝術，葉遐庵鄭午昌齊白石諸家之題跋中當推許及之，觀賞諸君，亦當有同感也。</p>
<p>華光大士論畫梅日「下筆有力，最莫遷延，醮　濃淡，不許浪博，起筆縱逸，曲徑垂欺」。丹邱生寫竹則日：「寫竹幹用篆法，枝用草書法，寫葉用入分法，或用藝公撤筆法」。朱先生已徹悟斯道三眛，故寫梅畫竹，尤能曲盡其妙。</p>
<p>書法與畫道有密切關係，故之畫家，每多兼擅書法，講習朱先生畫，更當領略其書，贊諸同好，諒不以余之言爲謬。展覽閉幕愛作追記，以爲未曾親接朱先生藝術者告。</p>

        <h1>1944.12.12</h1>
<h3>Attacking Eight Enemy Ships Sunk in Surigao Strait: Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Achievements of the Danshin Unit</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on November 11th: The six planes of the Japanese Special Attack Unit, the Danshin Air Unit, attacked an enemy transport convoy in the Surigao Strait southeast of Leyte Island on December 10th, achieving the following results: Sunk two large transport ships, one cruiser or large destroyer, and two large landing craft; heavily damaged and set ablaze two large transport ships and one cruiser or large destroyer; the aforementioned cruiser or large destroyer that was heavily damaged and set ablaze was later sunk by Japanese fighter escorts.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the Philippine frontlines, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 9th, the weather in the Leyte area was extremely bad. Disregarding the adverse weather, the Japanese Air Force launched a fierce attack on enemy troops landing at Albuera, inflicting considerable damage on enemy tanks, armored vehicles, etc. in the vicinity of Albuera. Another unit attacked Albuera and other locations such as Ypaka and Calibara, destroying an enemy landing craft off the coast of Albuera and bombing and strafing a supply depot in Damlaan, causing it to ignite and burn.</p>
<p>Manila, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: American forces forcibly landing near Albuera have suffered heavy damage and are advancing north with tanks and armored vehicles towards Ormoc. Japanese garrison forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Furthermore, in the vicinity of Albuera, Japanese units are continuing to launch fierce attacks on the enemy landing forces. The Japanese Air Force is also braving the adverse weather to cooperate with ground troops in a fierce bombing campaign against the enemy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Occupy the Brown Airfield on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Manila, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy's largest air base on Leyte Island, the north and south airfields of Brown, have finally been occupied by the Japanese. As a result, the enemy's main objective in the Leyte Island operation, which was to establish a strong air base, has suffered a major setback. Furthermore, the occupation of Brown will have a significant impact on the entire land battle on Leyte Island and deserves close attention. Since the enemy's aircraft carrier strength suffered heavy losses after operations in the Philippines and a major gap emerged in the deployment of air power, they have been striving to develop the Brown airfield, the only one on Leyte Island capable of handling large aircraft, pouring in large amounts of personnel and materials. Unfortunately, their efforts were unsuccessful, and the number of aircraft they needed to assemble was also captured by the Japanese army's surprise air and land attack. Brown, together with Tacloban and Dulag, forms one end of the triangle of the central base of the Leyte Island field army. The enemy is well aware of the importance and weakness of this area and has deployed strong forces near Tanauan to attempt to invade the western mountain highlands and eliminate the threat from the side. But all to no avail. In short, the loss of this airfield has had a major impact on the entire enemy force on Leyte Island.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: After the Japanese "Airborne Divine Soldiers" of the Takachiho Unit strongly attacked San Pablo, the enemy's position fell into a state of chaos. According to reports from the Japanese land forces, large fires broke out at the Brown South Airfield and San Pablo Airfield on the evening of the 7th. Furthermore, a portion of the Japanese paratrooper unit that forcibly landed on the 26th of last month is still alive and active. The enemy's 7th Division and 76th Division are now extremely exhausted, and their will to fight is waning. As of the 9th, the north and south airfields of Brown remained in Japanese hands.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack on India of Great Significance</h3>
<p>Tokyo, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese air force units attacked a B-29 type aircraft base west of Calcutta, India, on the 7th. Amidst fierce enemy resistance, they launched a fierce attack on the airfield and achieved the results announced by the Imperial Headquarters. This attack is of great significance because the total number of B-29 type aircraft in India and mainland China is no less than 400, and their strength is very considerable. They used Kharagpur in India as an air base, with Calcutta and Ceylon as major bases, and then opportunistically deployed a portion of their forces to Chengdu to prepare for further air raids on Kyushu, Japan. At the same time, in addition to air raids on Manchuria for the past two months, they have also directly advanced from their Indian base to spy on southern regions such as Singapore, Sumatra, and Bangkok, echoing the battle on the Philippine Islands in the Pacific. Furthermore, with the sudden and urgent development of the Burma front, their actions have become more active. At the same time, the enemy's Mariana base in the Pacific has been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army for days, so the only relatively safe base is the Calcutta base. However, this Japanese air raid has proven that this area can be threatened at any time in the future, and that even the B-29 aircraft base is in danger of being attacked by the Japanese army at any time.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base on the Burmese front, November 10th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 7th, under the bright light of the waning crescent moon, the night bombing squadron of the Japanese Air Force in Burma launched a long-range bombing raid on the enemy's 20th Bomber Airfield in Midnapore, the heart of India, and a B-29 airfield 170 kilometers west of Calcutta. Amidst the flashing of enemy anti-aircraft fire, Japanese aircraft successively entered the airspace above the airfield, dropped bombs, burned five enemy aircraft, and inflicted significant damage on other facilities, causing large fires to break out in many places. All aircraft returned safely.</p>

<p>Tokyo, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Several American P-57 type aircraft from the Chongqing-based air force invaded the Hong Kong area at around 9:40 AM on the 8th, but two were shot down by the Japanese side, and they immediately retreated.</p>
<h3>Person from Inland Talks About Chongqing's Numerous Difficulties: Military Command Cannot Be Unified</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: According to a person who recently arrived from inland Sichuan, the people of Sichuan are resentful and opposed to American pressure on Chongqing and have specially sent Zhang Lan as a representative to make suggestions to Chiang Kai-shek, urging Chiang to respect China's autonomy and independence and to reduce the suffering of the people. Chiang was deeply surprised when he received the letter of suggestion and immediately investigated the background of this move. As a result, he learned that it was instigated and planned behind the scenes by ×× military personnel and is currently being carefully studied. Zhang Lan was formerly the governor of West Sichuan Province and later the president of Chengdu University.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Military Power Cannot Be Unified: Regarding the reasons for Chongqing's defeat in the Guangxi campaign, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published a thesis tracing the root causes, generally stating that the orders of the Chongqing Supreme Command were inconsistent with the orders of the theater commander, resulting in failure. According to the discussion, the so-called orders from the Chongqing Supreme Command were issued by the Military Affairs Commission, while the orders from the local theater commander were issued by the American staff, who did not go through the Chongqing government and directly issued orders from the local headquarters, resulting in inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Chongqing Is Full of Refugees: Now, there are more than 600,000 refugees from Hunan and Guangxi who are wandering in the interior. Although Chongqing has sent buses and trains to transport them, it is still not enough. In the past, the population of Guiyang was 200,000, but now it has reached over 300,000. The population of Chongqing used to be around 990,000, but now it has exceeded 1,250,000. It is said that the two cities have taken measures to prevent refugees from entering. In these areas, refugees are staying in public places such as guild halls, warehouses, and schools, and are everywhere along the way. At the same time, the general public is very dissatisfied with the local relief work. In particular, the sharp increase in refugees has led to a sharp increase in the black market prices of goods and transportation costs. For example, the original price of a long-distance bus ticket from Guiyang to Chongqing was 6,000 yuan, but the black market price reached more than 40,000 yuan. Even hiring a truck costs 300,000 yuan per day.</p>
<p>Chongqing Sends Personnel to Relieve Refugees: Guangzhou, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: While busy with troop replenishment and front-line expansion, the relief of refugees has become a major problem. According to a telegram from Chongqing, the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission and the Social Affairs Department of the Kuomintang have jointly undertaken this work and have sent 300 staff members to Qijiang, Guangyuan, and Bishan in Sichuan, and Zunyi and other places in Guizhou. According to news from Yong'an, Fujian, the provincial relief committee has provided relief to a total of 8,000 coastal refugees, teachers, and students in the past two days.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Raid Suichuan Airfield Again</h3>
<p>Mainland Base, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: A squadron of Japanese bombers raided the Suichuan airfield on the evening of the 9th, braving intense anti-aircraft fire to fiercely attack aircraft and ancillary facilities stationed at the airfield. Two large aircraft and one small aircraft were hit and caught fire. Two aircraft of unspecified type and military facilities were also destroyed. The Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Nanjing Hold Decisive Battle Rally</h3>

<h3>People in Longzhou and Other Places Actively Assist Japanese Forces</h3>
<p>Hanoi, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese forces advancing from Vietnam have occupied Longzhou, Mingjiang, Ningming, and other places. The local residents have returned one after another, and flags supporting the Nanjing government are flying everywhere. The 188th Division of the Chongqing army, which was previously stationed along the Guangxi border, requisitioned food from the people, so the people did not cooperate with the Chongqing army when the Japanese forces attacked. The Japanese army, on the other hand, reversed what they deeply hated and allowed the residents to live and work in peace after occupying individual areas, so they all actively cooperated with the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Governor-General's Office of Vietnam Holds First Deliberative Council</h3>
<p>Hanoi, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: The highest advisory body of the Governor-General's Office of Vietnam, the Deliberative Council of Vietnam, was established on the 1st of this month and held its first meeting at the Governor-General's residence on the 9th, chaired by Governor-General Decoux, to exchange views on current economic issues.</p>

Fraser is 56 years old and was originally the commander of the British fleet in Southeast Asia. Vice Admiral Power has been appointed commander of the East Indies station, while Rear Admiral Daniel has been appointed deputy commander of the British Pacific Fleet.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Will Launch Next Phase of War in South China: Chen Cheng Speaks to Foreign Correspondents</h3>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a telegram from Chongqing, Chen Cheng, the newly appointed Minister of Military Administration in Chongqing, met with foreign journalists for the first time on the 9th and spoke about the war situation in South China as follows: From any point of view, the Japanese army will have to prepare to launch the next phase of the war. The goal of the Japanese army is to completely control the Canton-Hankou Railway, to completely ensure land communication between mainland China and French Vietnam, and, taking advantage of the insufficient strength of the Chongqing army in Guizhou Province, to turn their sharp edge towards Guizhou, currently advancing and retreating at a point a hundred and ten kilometers away from Guiyang. Chen Cheng also spoke about the reform of the Chongqing army and the issue of cooperation with the United States, the main points of which are as follows: It is a well-known fact that the Chongqing army is unable to fight against the Japanese army, so we must strengthen and reform this incapable Chongqing army.</p>
<p>Implementing the Military First Policy: Lisbon, November 11th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to overcome the current military crisis, the Chongqing military authorities have recently been desperately focusing on military matters. According to local sources, Song Ziwen, the acting president of the Executive Yuan, stated the following: In this time of pressing crisis, military issues must be dealt with first, and all measures taken by the government are to aid the military in its fight against Japan.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Third Anniversary of the War: Broadcast Address by Information Minister Matsudaira</h3>
<p>Military Supply Production Reduced by 60%: "According to the speech given by Minister of Wartime Supplies Sumawit at the CTD Conference in mid-November, the average production of military supplies has been reduced to 60% of the planned amount. On the 28th of the same month, the US Army Department announced that Eisenhower's European Expeditionary Force had dispatched 27 officers to this country in five groups to visit various military factories to emphasize the increase in military production in order to urge the United States to urgently send weapons and ammunition. Why has the average military production in the United States been reduced by 60% of the planned amount? This is ultimately due to the impact of inflation caused by the huge budget of 200 billion US dollars. To explain further, it is because the conversion of peacetime industries to military industries has gradually reduced general materials, and the consumption of materials due to the expansion of the front lines and the intensification of the war has significantly increased, so the necessary materials for life are also in short supply. According to fragmentary information, for example, no store in Chicago could obtain white butter oil in July of this year, and in Los Angeles, 900 restaurants and 100 grocery stores have closed down, the allocation of milk has been reduced by 50%, and white butter oil has been reduced by 60%. Due to the shortage of materials, people are queuing up to buy things from morning to night.</p>
<p>Material Shortages Affect Life: Furthermore, recent purchases are purchased in queues like in Shanghai, and there is no more cigarette allocation to the military. Although the prices of agricultural products are not controlled, because of the sharp decline in this year's wheat harvest, each person has to reduce their average meal by 20%. Although it is called the world's largest wheat-producing country and a country that exports to foreign countries, the reduction of each person's meal by 20% this year is a situation that has never been imagined before. Therefore, the United States, which has abundant materials, is now in a state of utter depletion of materials, and inflation is promoting the rise in prices. As a result, wages have to be increased, and because of the suppression of capitalists, strikes and labor disputes occur frequently, naturally causing production to decrease. On the other hand, there is a continuous stream of people who want to convert from the price-controlled military industry to the price-uncontrolled peacetime industry, and the government cannot control this, so it has allowed people to operate 72 types of peacetime industries since July. The military industry is now drastically reduced, and since December, 120 major cities have taken measures to stop the recovery of peacetime industries, exposing the government's incompetence, and the mistakes made by their leaders are fully exposed by the above phenomena."</p>
<p>Our View of Britain and America</p>
<p>Turning the tables, what is our view of Britain and America? Our Easterners' ideas are based on direct impressions, as just described. I believe that until Japan decided on its final policy on December 8th three years ago, everything was analyzed from all aspects, and judgments were made based on scientific foundations established by reference to numerical statistics, and the future of the country was considered more calmly, with no evil thoughts existing in the pure and honest state of mind, and the destiny of the country was directly felt. Based on this comprehensive judgment, the country's major policies were decided. I believe that in the inference of all things, which is more reasonable, to be directly touched, or to be obtained by scientific inference? This question is extremely difficult to determine. Although we cannot determine which is absolutely superior and absolutely reasonable, at least the most ideal is to be directly touched and to be inferred by scientific vision. In this sense, we have both kinds of feelings, both directly touched and scientifically visionary.</p>
<p>Exerting All Efforts to Win Victory: Since the enemy's counterattack on Guadalcanal, Japan's observation of the enemy has become more accurate, and there is a consistent view from top to bottom, but the enemy has not yet clearly recognized the true nature of Japan, and its guidance of its own people is also disjointed. Especially in the United States, they fabricate false war results that Japan's strength has been weakened to promote Japan's weakness and their own strength to the people, while the army and navy promote to the people that Japan is difficult to invade and try their best to encourage the strengthening of combat power. This is the enemy's weakness. All beliefs that are born from intuition are true beliefs. We have spirit and beliefs in our weapons, and we have the best quality of combat compared to the enemy. Because we have this confidence, we must exert all our spiritual and material strength for the coming decisive fourth year and win the glory of final victory. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The People Are Supreme (Part 1)</h3>
<p>A nation is constituted by three elements: land, people, and sovereignty. The absence of any one of these three elements renders a nation incomplete. Among these, the most crucial element is the people. Consequently, the political institutions of a nation should prioritize the interests and welfare of its people. As the ancient sages stated, "The people are the foundation of the state; when the foundation is secure, the state is at peace." This principle not only represents the political philosophy of China for thousands of years but has also become the political conviction of the Chinese populace. The adage "Those who win the hearts of the people prosper, those who lose the hearts of the people perish" underscores whether the political policies of a nation garner the support of its populace.</p>
<p>The Chinese people do not traditionally regard the state and the government as an indivisible entity. At times, they perceive them as entirely separate entities. Therefore, the people adopt a selective attitude toward the government. However, due to the excessively composed and resilient nature of the Chinese people, their selection of a government is not particularly proactive. They only display enthusiasm towards a government that they wholeheartedly and sincerely endorse. Conversely, they will revolt against a government that they deeply abhor, even at the cost of mutual destruction. Towards a government that has not yet reached the threshold of deep abhorrence, they adopt a laissez-faire attitude, refraining from demanding civil rights from the government in advance to rectify its errors or impeach its improprieties, until it reaches the point of deep abhorrence, at which point they rise up in revolution, prepared for mutual destruction. The cyclical pattern of order and chaos in Chinese politics over thousands of years has not deviated from this pattern. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People were rooted in historical precedent.</p>
<p>From this, we can understand that a chasm exists between the Chinese government and its people. The class of scholar-officials who "excel in learning and then seek officialdom" (now referred to as intellectuals) are the ones who bridge this chasm. Due to the generally low level of education among the Chinese people, intellectuals constitute the backbone of society, and their influence is likened to "the wind upon the grass." The people's choice of government is based on the direction of the intellectuals. Throughout history, intellectuals have played a leading role in major revolutionary movements, a fact that has become irrefutable. If the intellectuals, the mainstay of society, do not address the interests of the people, which are also the interests of the entire nation, and instead side with their own private interests and become enemies of the people, they will accelerate the demise of the nation and widen the distance between the government and the people.</p>
<p>In this way, we can further understand that only when the government acts in the best interests of the nation and strives for the happiness of the people, strengthens itself, and interacts with sincerity, will the people be "heartily convinced" and care about politics as if it were their own personal affair. Only a government supported by the people has a legitimate basis for a political party to exist. Political parties will never thrive in governments without a foundation of popular support.</p>
<p>These are not profound political theories but rather the basic political knowledge of a modern citizen and the fundamental principles for a government to lead its people toward a modern nation. Recently, I read some key documents published by the Kuomintang: one is the declaration issued by the Sixth Provisional Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for the passing of Chairman Wang; the other is a letter to the people of the whole country on carrying out the Chairman's last will. The Kuomintang is the largest political party in China and the ruling party leading the construction of a new China. Her remarks are the direction of Chinese politics and the indicator of the efforts of the general public. Therefore, all Chinese people should pay attention to them, especially those who bear the responsibility of public opinion, should pay more attention to them, and support these two important documents from the perspective of the people. At the same time, the opinions of the people should be expressed from the standpoint of the people. The above-mentioned basic political theories are the basic viewpoints for us to express our opinions.</p>
<p>The words of the declaration and the letter to the people are earnest and insightful, giving the people a deep impression that the Kuomintang is full of vigor. The fundamental spirit is to inherit Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings and the last will of Chairman Wang, to complete peaceful nation-building, to implement the revolutionary spirit of the Three Principles of the People, to declare externally the determination to oppose communism and Anglo-American imperialism, to cooperate to complete the war, to strive for co-existence and co-prosperity, and to ask internally for the unification of the party and the country. They expressed sympathy and understanding for the plight of Chongqing today and put forward the principle of "the party must not be divided, and the country must be unified." They also stated that "Now that Mr. Wang has abandoned us and passed away, we are not worried that communism cannot be eradicated, but only that the comrades of our party cannot unite; we are not worried that the policies of imperialism cannot be resisted, but only that the revolutionary efforts will be dispersed day by day..." A few words are enough to express the honest spirit of the Nanjing Kuomintang comrades and can promote the awakening of the Chongqing comrades who are hesitating and wavering, which is beyond doubt. On domestic political issues, they pointed out that "the bureaucratic system is an obstacle to eroding the revolutionary spirit" and that "corrupt politics directly disturbs the people's livelihood and indirectly creates the poison of red disaster." They also said: "It is inevitable that life will be difficult during the war, but the roaming bandits are rampant, destroying production, the cunning merchants hoard and manipulate prices, and the harsh taxes and levies are sucking blood, all of which are man-made pains." Then it says that "this party must do its best to implement it, so that every word and sentence will be realized." In short, to seek independence externally, we must first unify the party and the country, and to seek unity internally, we must first stabilize the people's livelihood. Then we can "All my comrades and compatriots must look up to this purpose, abide by the General's legacy, follow the President's last will, have no second thoughts, no detours, be courageous and diligent, and achieve final success." Building a new Republic of China with the Three Principles of the People as its foundation.</p>
<p>Indeed, the world is changing rapidly, and the mission of the Kuomintang comrades is becoming heavier, and the responsibilities of all our compatriots are also greater, and the problems that need to be solved are more and more complex. No matter how heavy the responsibility is and how complex the problem is, there is only one fundamental requirement, that is, the government does not leave the people and leads from the front instead of facing them. The root cause of the "deep suffering of the people" in today's political situation lies in the fact that "those who are responsible in all aspects either turn a blind eye because officials' lives are difficult, or reduce the punishment for subordinates based on past merits, which leads to the deterioration of officialdom and the neglect of government affairs..." The result is that "the bureaucratic system is an obstacle to eroding the revolutionary spirit" and "corrupt politics directly disturbs the people's livelihood and indirectly creates the poison of red disaster." The leaders of the government reviewed the shortcomings of past politics in front of the people, frankly admitted their responsibilities, and made up their minds to reform and renew the people. This kind of statesmanly demeanor is admirable! However, looking at the problem more closely, we feel that "turning a blind eye" and "reconciling based on past merits" are still external factors. The root of the root is that some peace activists in the party and government personnel are not firm in their belief in peace, and they do not have a thorough spirit, and even mistakenly think that the present is a transitional era. As a result, they take the opportunity to fish in troubled waters and use their positions to do things that are blinded by profit, and they do not know how to serve the country, but only how to serve themselves.</p>

<h3>Soviet-French Alliance Treaty Signed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, November 11th, Central News Agency: According to Moscow Radio: The visit of De Gaulle and Foreign Minister Bidault to Moscow demonstrates various expressions of sympathy between the two nations, which has been strengthened by the experiences of the two nations in the war. During the talks, the Soviet side was chaired by Chairman Stalin and Foreign Minister Molotov. Operational actions, peace organization, and the German issue were all on the agenda. The two governments repeatedly emphasized their determination to defeat Germany and their willingness to jointly take necessary measures to protect Europe from further aggression, which has now been completed. Based on the spirit of this decision, the two governments signed an alliance and mutual assistance agreement on December 10th, which will be announced separately by both parties.</p>
<p>Britain and France will also sign an agreement. Stockholm, Sweden, Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency: London reports: Following the establishment of the Soviet-French alliance and mutual assistance treaty, Britain and France will also sign an agreement to complete the triangular friendship between Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. London newspapers welcomed the Soviet-French treaty, stating that it is similar in nature to the agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union, and is important not only for continuing the war but also in peacetime.</p>
<h3>German and Hungarian Forces Recapture Three Important Cities in Southern Hungary</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency: In the Battle of Budapest, German and Hungarian resistance has strengthened. After the Northern Saar forces occupied Veszprém, they made no further progress. Only a portion of the Soviet forces gathered there intends to attack Budapest, while another team is advancing towards the Slovak border, apparently intending to cut off German transportation. Soviet forces southwest of Budapest are currently pressing towards Budapest, and German forces are fiercely resisting and sometimes counterattacking. South of Lake Balaton, German forces have recaptured the three cities of Keszthely, Marcali, and Balaton.</p>
<h3>Post-War Transportation of Three Countries</h3>
<p>Geneva, November 11th, Central News Agency, German News Agency: In the Anglo-American-Soviet post-war transportation conference currently being held in London, representatives of the three countries are vying for favorable rights for their respective countries in the European transportation system. Not only have conflicts of opinion arisen between the American and Soviet representatives, but also friction between Britain and the United States. Although Britain and the United States have agreed on unified management, the Soviet side objects to this proposal and advocates that transportation lines should be extended to the Soviet border.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battles on the Saar Front for Four Days and Nights: American Forces' New Tactics Encounter Setbacks</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Army in the West, November 11th, Central News Agency, Huitong News Agency: On the Saar front, the fighting is becoming increasingly fierce along the 50-kilometer stretch from Mancy to Saarbrücken. The intensity of the street fighting is second only to that of the Battle of Aachen. The focus of the fighting is in Dillingen, where fierce battles have been raging for over 100 hours. General Patton's new tactic of seizing the Siegfried Line for the first time, sending small groups of tanks and engineers to infiltrate various sections in an attempt to disrupt communication between them, has encountered setbacks in Dillingen. The commando team that broke in was surrounded and cut off by German forces.</p>
<p>Becoming the Second Graveyard of the American Army: The second focus of the battle in the Saar region is between Saarlautern and Ensdorf in Lower Saar. American forces attempted to break through the German positions but were repelled by concentrated German artillery fire. Since the Battle of Aachen, the Battle of the Saar can truly be called the second graveyard of the American army. The fierce fighting between Saargemünd and Haguenau is also related to the Battle of the Saar, but the American Seventh Army has not made easy progress either. American forces are attacking the city of Haguenau, and their vanguard has reached Bischwiller. German forces are now counterattacking. There are no major changes in the Aachen area. After German forces withdrew from the Rur bridgehead near Jülich, the river has now become the main front line for the two armies.</p>
<h3>Formation of the Bonomi Cabinet in Italy</h3>

<h3>Travel Notes in Wuhan (1)</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>On November 3rd, braving the light drizzle, the plane I was on landed at Hankou Airport. Just like Shanghai, which is located along the Huangpu River, Hankou is also located along the Yangtze River. The area equivalent to Yangshupu in Shanghai is the Japanese Concession; the area equivalent to the Public Concession is the French and British Concessions. What Pudong is to Shanghai, Wuchang is to Hankou, and what Nanshi is to Shanghai, Hanyang City is to Hankou. Wuhan is unfamiliar to me, so as soon as I got off the plane, I jumped into a rickshaw and followed the directions I was given to the residence of Mr. Jiang Xianqi on Huangpi Road, whom Mr. Su Chengde of Shanghai introduced me to. I was a bit negligent because I didn't realize that Mr. Jiang had the title of Lieutenant General in the Army until after we exchanged business cards. Speaking of lieutenant generals, according to Japanese etiquette, a commoner like me without any official position is not supposed to casually visit such an important person. If I were to request a meeting, I would have to be turned away two or three times or go through several intermediaries before I could see him. However, although Mr. Jiang Xianqi had the title of lieutenant general, he was not the kind of person who inspired awe, but rather he met me immediately with a friendly demeanor. This attitude of the Chinese people is perhaps what foreigners call Chinese-style democracy. This is not to say that China's current politics are democratic. It is very surprising that even though China has remnants of a feudal system that are more deeply rooted than in Japan, social life is filled with a more intense atmosphere of democracy than in Japan. A Chinese person once told me that they always feel a chill when approaching Japanese people, simply because of the awe-inspiring seriousness that Japanese people possess. In short, there are no class-based social customs in China that prevent ordinary people from directly contacting "noble" people, so there is an environment in which Chinese people can talk to each other directly. Japanese people do not have this kind of environment. In order to make friends with Japanese people, you have to invite them for a drink first. Only when they are drunk and forget about class etiquette will they reveal their human nature. Japanese people who haven't had three cups of sake often behave like male dogs encountering each other on the street for the first time, cautiously approaching each other with a wary attitude, using their sense of smell to test each other's strength. Chinese people, on the other hand, act the opposite when they meet each other for the first time, just like a male dog finding a female dog on the side of the road, wagging its tail and walking forward, expressing a friendly and amiable attitude. I have lived among the Chinese people for ten years, and this kind of kindness has deeply permeated my soul. This time, Mr. Jiang's whole family also welcomed me with heartfelt joy. I felt like a female dog surrounded by a group of male dogs, surrounded by an atmosphere of amiability. That night, I had a great time. I took Mr. Jiang's car to the Deming Hotel on Simin Road.</p>
<p>Brightness</p>
<p>There has been no electricity in Hankou for a week. I heard that it has been raining continuously for a week. It was so cold and dark that I couldn't muster any energy, so I had to go to bed early. But at this time, a young cultural figure named Song Luohong came to visit me during my travels. The young man who swaggered into my sleeping quarters made me very happy. Mr. Song said that the articles I wrote were very popular with the people of Wuhan. I told him that it was not a good thing for a foreigner's articles to be welcomed in China. When the time comes when Chinese people can freely comment on everything in their own country, then the nonsensical articles I write will be discarded. I sincerely hope that that era will come soon. When Mr. Song heard my remarks, he seemed unable to think of an appropriate response and just stared silently at my face.</p>
<p>After Mr. Song left, I found it difficult to fall asleep as a guest in a foreign land, so I began to ponder alone in the darkness. The damp hotel room, permeated with moisture, was very dark, much like living in a cave in ancient times. A world without light is indeed terrifying. When humans first appeared on this world, God must have given them fire. Recently, I read the world-renowned Beijing anthropologist Dr. Pei Wenzhong's record of the lives of the Peking Man, who lived 400,000 years ago, published in the "China Journal." It said that the Peking Man used to hunt and eat each other, and even these humans had traces of fire in their caves. Perhaps it was not used for burning things, but because they were very afraid of the dark, they used it to obtain light. At that time, the deadly enemy of humans was the giant animal with sword-like teeth, the "Saber-toothed Tiger." They often attacked the Peking Man from the darkness, and with a stab of their sharp teeth, a large hole would appear in the human skull. At that time, the Peking Man, who had no other weapons to fight the enemy, could only throw stones. The only defense against the Saber-toothed Tiger was to light a fire in the cave where they lived. Wild beasts were particularly afraid of light, so the Peking Man barely escaped the Saber-toothed Tiger's attacks. Today's Chinese people are fortunate not to have the Saber-toothed Tiger's troubles, but what they cannot avoid is the disaster of the "Grain-hoarding Tiger." Someone said, "The suffering of the Chinese people is inherent." The lives of the Peking Man and modern Chinese people are filled with disasters. To avoid this kind of disaster, we need to ignite the fire of reason. — It was in this kind of contemplation that I finally spent my first night in Wuhan.</p>
<p>The Vitality of the Chinese People</p>
<p>After breakfast, I braved the fine rain and went for a walk on the street. I heard in Shanghai that Hankou was almost bombed by American planes every day, but I couldn't see any traces of bombing in the city. Emergency repairs are carried out in the bombed areas, and people continue to live happily there as before. The Chinese people are like weeds, with extremely strong vitality. No matter how you trample on them, no matter how you ravage them, they will still get up. This is truly an incomprehensible vitality. As I walked, I wondered what exactly is the essence of the Chinese people's mysterious vitality? Unknowingly, I stepped into the crowd of people gathered at the market. The morning markets in China, from the southern end to the northern end, are all the same bustling. People always hope to buy as much and as fragrant food as possible with as little money as possible, and they "bargain" with all their might. I saw a lady trying to buy a big carp from an old fisherman. The old fisherman asked for 500 yuan, while the lady offered 300 yuan, a very large difference. The old fisherman said that it had been raining every day recently and he couldn't catch any fish, so the minimum price was 450 yuan, and he wouldn't sell it for a penny less. I thought they could close the deal at 400 yuan, but it still didn't work out. Suddenly, I remembered a short story written by the great Spanish writer Blasco Ibáñez. The story was about a fisherman who had not been able to catch fish for four or five days and took his thirteen-year-old son to the sea to fish for tuna. After a great deal of effort, a big tuna finally got caught on the hook. After half an hour of focused pulling, they managed to get the fish onto the boat. Looking back, the son was missing from the boat. During the period of focusing on fighting the fish, his own son had accidentally fallen into the sea and disappeared with the raging waves. The fisherman silently rowed the boat back to the land washed by the sea. The fisherman briefly told the wife who came to greet him, and the wife just grieved silently. The fisherman was not surprised that the sea had taken his son. At the same time as the couple mourned the death of their son, they loudly argued about the price with the people from the city fish shop who came to buy the fish. The merchants tried to buy the fish as cheaply as possible, while the couple, spurred by the pain of their son's death, resolutely wanted to sell it at the highest possible price. But perhaps only the fisherman's family, who paid the price of their son's life, knew the true price of this tuna! As I thought about Ibáñez's "Fisherman" story in my mind, I stared blankly at the old fisherman's face. It was a plain, kind face of an "ordinary person" that can be seen everywhere in China. In the wrinkles of his face, although I couldn't definitely determine whether there was an expression of a son being taken away by the suppressive squad, or whether there was the "sorrow" of the whole family being scattered by the war, but in his silence, it was clear to see the fiery determination to fight without retreating a step in order to maintain the minimum level of life, and the strong vitality possessed only by those who are forced to live on the lowest survival line. I thought that this was perhaps the essence of the Chinese people's vitality, which is generally considered mysterious. Everywhere in China, there are poor people struggling on the lowest survival line. These people, no matter how their hometown is bombarded, no matter how their homes are destroyed to the point where not a single tile remains, cannot leave their homeland a step. Leaving their land is equivalent to suicide for these people. Therefore, even if the walls collapse, they plaster them with mud; even if the roof leaks, they cover it with wheat straw, and they still live there. This is the scene of the Chinese people defending their hometowns to the death. — As I thought this in my heart, I stared at the old fisherman's face again. At this time, the rain was still falling non-stop.</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>There are two or three salt administration warehouses in the city of Hankou. In the morning, when heavy trucks transported salt to other places, a group of poor people would rush over to pick up the scattered grains of salt. They would pick up even a grain of salt that had fallen on the road, together with the mud and dirt. Salt is such a highly valued and precious commodity in Hankou. In Hunan and Hubei, salt is the biggest problem. It is said that in the countryside, a handful of salt is sometimes used as payment for a day's short-term labor. In a country like Japan, which is surrounded by the sea, salt is as cheap as air, so I never thought that salt would become a problem. Turgenev's prose poem tells the story of a Russian landowner who went to visit a tenant farmer who had suddenly lost a son. Seeing the mother of the dead son heartily drinking the leftover vegetable soup, she was furious and said, "You can still drink vegetable soup while grieving over the death of your son!" The tenant farmer's mother replied, "What the lady says is right, but there is salt in this bowl of vegetable soup!" Anyone who does not know how precious and important salt is in Russia does not understand the meaning of this story. The main component of tears is salt. Poor people cannot cry if they do not have salt. The landowner who does not know the value of salt naturally cannot understand the true sorrow of the tenant farmer. The Greek philosopher said, "One grieves, but does not cry; one cries, but does not grieve." Therefore, the emotion of "sorrow" is perhaps excessive for peasants who cannot cry.</p>
<p>In ancient Rome, there was an era when salt was used as currency. The English word for salt is "Salt," and the German word is "Salz." Roman soldiers received salt instead of salary, so salary is called "Salary" and soldiers are called "Soldier" or "Soldat." But in China, especially in Hubei, although salt is not currency, it has a value that is even more precious than currency, it is the life of the people. I once asked someone, "Currency can lead those who use it to evil, so what about salt?" The answer was, "Salt is used for preservation, but in China, it is used to corrupt people." I heard that in Hankou, another incident similar to the Hou Daxun case has now occurred because of salt.</p>

<h3>Although Air Defense Shows Progress, Strengthening Still Requires Effort: Air Defense Headquarters Comments on Training Performance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters issued the following comments on the performance of the air defense training on the 9th of this month:</p>
<p>General air defense training has shown progress everywhere. People of all nationalities, including Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners, have enthusiastically participated. The headquarters is deeply impressed. The progress of the Chinese people in particular is surprising. Women have also voluntarily participated, which is enough to change the long-standing perception of the Chinese people and proves that the new Chinese citizens can truly live and die together with Japan, which is extremely moving. However, some members of the public still lack practical experience and engage in mostly impractical actions and preparations. The following is a detailed description of each item:</p>
<p>Facilities and Materials</p>
<p>There is a general feeling that facilities and materials are insufficient, and the number of tools is particularly small. Even the horizontal supports are incomplete. Furthermore, the number of safety devices such as ladder supports and ladder treads is extremely small, which is terrifying at first sight. The construction of air raid shelters also needs to be increased because air raid shelters are very reliable during actual air raids. Therefore, most air defense helmets are merely formal, consisting of a thin layer of cloth. As seen during the last air raid, when anti-aircraft artillery shrapnel was falling like rain, they would definitely be useless. Therefore, even if there are no iron helmets to wear, thick silk floss and other materials must be thickly padded inside the helmet so that it hangs down to the shoulders for protection.</p>
<p>Evacuation Drills</p>
<p>Some people lie face down in the road, which cannot protect their backs and will inevitably be injured by machine-gun fire. Therefore, it is important to immediately choose to use the terrain or objects on the ground. When walking on the road, one should consider how to select an evacuation site, and pedestrians should also actively participate in drills.</p>
<p>Firefighting Preparations</p>
<p>Attention is only paid to watering a portion of the area, but not to large-scale watering or preventing the spread of fire. Furthermore, many people only focus on passing buckets of water but neglect quick and effective individual watering drills. There is generally very little water supply. Using such a small amount of water will not actually extinguish the fire. Therefore, efforts should be made to increase water storage sites and fire prevention water tanks, constantly store water, and prevent winter freezing. Also, the number of pumps is generally very small, and their use is not perfect. It must be remembered that firefighting is the essence of civil air defense firefighting, so more attention should be paid to operational preparations.</p>
<p>Rescue Work</p>
<p>The methods of rolling bandages, using triangular bandages, and stopping bleeding are mostly clumsy, so drills must be intensified. Furthermore, emergency rescue is carried out near the fire or on the fire prevention activity route, which should be reconsidered and carried out after transporting the injured to a smaller road.</p>
<p>Work situation, this has not been paid much attention, and is only imitating excavation and rescue work. The preparation of tools is extremely small. One must anticipate dangerous objects such as electric wires and power lines, and the destruction of water and gas pipes, and intensify preparations and drills.</p>
<p>Guidance and Application</p>
<p>The impracticality of activities is mostly due to the guidance not being perfect. The constantly changing situation must be quickly displayed, and people must be taught how to respond quickly. If the guidance is effective, then firefighting, rescue, and work drills will be quite realistic. Currently, firefighting and rescue teams are formed by Chinese, Japanese, and foreigners. When the air defense zone is completed, the skills, number of people, level of knowledge, and age of each country should be considered. An attempt should be made to form firefighting teams with Japanese people, work teams with Chinese people, and rescue teams with foreigners, so that a complete and integrated situation is achieved. Although it is difficult to equip all the materials and finances, efforts should still be made to cooperate and maximize capabilities, and the instructors should reorganize the teams accordingly.</p>
<p>Light Control</p>
<p>The warning control is quite good, but the extinguishing equipment is still not complete, and there are still several places where light leaks out. Moving to air defense control takes three minutes. Generally speaking, the performance is quite good, but there are still forty or fifty lights leaking out. These lights provide excellent targets for enemy aircraft attacks, so efforts must be made to improve. The performance in the concession area is poor. The area north of the Suzhou River is generally good, but not perfect. Therefore, more attention must be paid. The control equipment in general households and shops is insufficient, and the performance is extremely poor, so special attention must be paid to this. However, the warning control that starts at 7:00 PM is slightly better.</p>
<p>The air defense organization in factories is not yet fully sufficient. The protection of important production departments, which is vital for strengthening and stabilizing the people's livelihood, has not yet been established, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>City Police Department Personnel Changes</h3>
<p>He Dehui, the chief of the Old Zhabei Branch of the City Police Department, has requested to resign due to his transfer to Beijing for work. His request has been approved. The vacancy will be temporarily filled by Deputy Chief You Tian Houji. In addition, Yao Zongrui, the chief inspector of the Reward and Punishment Supervision Office of the Inspectorate, a third-class police supervisor, has served for more than 30 years and has made significant contributions. His resignation was also approved last month.</p>

<h3>News of Speakers Assisting Students: Students Aided by Various Universities Are Willing to Jointly Promote "Special Fundraising"; Hoping Each Person Will Form a Team or Combine into One</h3>
<p>Although the results of the student aid fund "Special Fundraising Team" launched by this newspaper have been mediocre for the past ten days, the expressions of sympathy and efforts to promote it from all quarters are proceeding enthusiastically. We believe that in the near future, donations from all sectors will flow in steadily, reaching our expected target. According to Mr. Ji Chuanbao, a student liaison from the university student fellowship of this newspaper's student aid fund, who came to the office yesterday, "The students aided by various universities are deeply moved by this special fundraising and are willing to use their spare time to solicit donations from relatives, friends, or classmates to accumulate small amounts into large amounts so that the work can be completed as soon as possible." This newspaper highly commends the wishes of the assisted students and will deliver one copy each of the soon-to-be-printed "Collective Donation Signing Form" and "Fundraising Rules" to the university fellowship representatives for distribution to the assisted students, aiming for each person to solicit donations for one team. For example, if relatives and friends donate an average of 2,000 yuan each, then ten people can form a team. The collected funds will be handed over to the representatives for transfer to this office, which will issue official receipts and publish them for verification.</p>
<p>Exhibition Results to Be Returned Starting Today</p>
<p>The exhibition of academic achievements of students aided by this newspaper, after its closing, has had the achievements of each group sorted separately, and everything is ready.

Numbers 201 and above will be returned from the 15th. The specialist and university groups will also be returned to each school starting today. This exhibition has attracted many visitors, and the frequency of flipping through the displayed items inevitably led to damage and soiling of the written materials. We hope the school authorities will understand.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Fundraising: Bank Donates Generously</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuqi, Chairman of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, came yesterday and stated: "Respectfully, our bank's new building was completed and an opening ceremony was held on the 2nd.

<p>Dao Yi Shi Master Holds Charity Exhibition Starting Today</p>
<p>Mr. Xu's Dao Yi Shi Studio has been collecting calligraphy, paintings, and cultural artifacts for over 20 years. His appraisals are precise and discerning, and he has always been highly regarded in artistic circles, but he does not easily show them to others. Now, because it is worrying that the children of poor families will drop out of school, and winter relief is urgently needed in the cold weather, he is holding a "20th Anniversary Calligraphy, Painting, and Cultural Artifacts Memorial Charity Sale." Hundreds of famous works of old masters and cultural relics are displayed at the China Book Garden at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Jingan Temple Road, from today (the 12th) to the 18th, for public exhibition. The proceeds, after deducting the cost of the venue and employee meals, will all be donated to the *Shen Bao* and *Xin Xin Bao* student loan funds and the public welfare relief programs undertaken by the two newspapers, creating blessings for the purchasing public.

Why not do something that benefits both parties?</p>

<h3>Postscript to Zhu Jihua's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Wuan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Jihua of Yuchuan recently held a calligraphy and painting exhibition at the China Art Gallery for the purpose of raising funds for Zhejiang Shaoxing Hospital. He exhibited more than 300 works, half calligraphy and half painting. On the one hand, he sought progress for public welfare, and on the other hand, he promoted the national art. His intentions were excellent and need no further explanation.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's paintings are mostly of flowers, bamboo, rocks, plum blossoms, and orchids, with occasional Buddhist paintings. His artistic conception and brushwork are deeply imbued with the style of Qing Teng and Bai Yang. His outstanding points have the transcendence of Nantian, but without its prettiness, and the unrestrainedness of Fuzhai, but without its vastness. The inscriptions by Ye Xihou, Zheng Wuchang, Qi Baishi, and others should be praised for this kind of art with high style and concise meaning, and those who appreciate it should also feel the same way.</p>
<p>Hua Guang Da Shi discussed painting plum blossoms, saying, "The brushwork must be powerful, and there must be no delay. The ink must be thick and light, and no sloppiness is allowed. The beginning of the stroke must be unrestrained, and the winding path must be deceptive." Dan Qiusheng wrote about bamboo, saying, "The bamboo trunk should be written with the seal script method, the branches with the cursive script method, the leaves with the *lishu* method, or with the Yi Gong's withdrawal method." Mr. Zhu has thoroughly understood this path, so he can fully express its wonders when painting plum blossoms and bamboo.</p>
<p>Calligraphy has a close relationship with the art of painting, so many painters are also skilled in calligraphy. When studying Mr. Zhu's paintings, one should also understand his calligraphy. I recommend it to all my friends, and I hope you will not think my words are wrong. I am writing this postscript after the closing of the exhibition to inform those who have not personally experienced Mr. Zhu's art.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Zhenxin Hospital Continues Free Clinics</h3>
<p>Shanghai Zhenxin Hospital, located at 252 Tianjin Road, was founded in the summer of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). It has 60 beds, without any distinction of class. In the past, it temporarily organized free clinics every summer and autumn, specializing in the treatment of epidemic diseases. Whether for outpatient or inpatient care, all medical expenses, meals, and accommodation were completely free. No introduction was needed, and no money was charged. It has been enthusiastically supported by people from all walks of life and maintained until now. This year, with the soaring prices, medical expenses are even more alarming. In order to assist patients who are unable to pay, the hospital will continue to provide free clinics. Except for surgery, which does not have the necessary equipment, the hospital specializes in internal medicine (excluding lung diseases, venereal diseases, and acute infectious diseases such as meningitis and scarlet fever), and it is still completely free and does not charge any money. Impoverished patients should take note of this.</p>
<h3>Responding to the Office's Six Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>Mr. Su Zijia wrote a letter saying: "Respectfully, the Social Services Office of your newspaper is holding various charitable activities, and its enthusiasm for public welfare is admirable. Although I am just a businessman, I should do my best to support local good deeds. I hereby donate all of my travel expenses from the Oil and Grain Control Committee from August 15th to the end of October, totaling 12,500 Central Reserve Bank notes, to your office's six relief efforts, expressing my meager sincerity. I have attached a check. Please accept it."</p>
<h3>Gruel Distribution Preparations Completed and Opened the Day Before Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Ferry Boat Industry Plans to Establish Free School</h3>
<p>In recent years, transportation on both sides of the Huangpu River in this city has made progress in traffic safety equipment under the guidance of the ferry boat union and the rowboat workers' union. Now that the industry union, in view of the soaring prices, which affect the studies of school-age children, has taken a step to serve the society, it has submitted a proposal to the sixth joint meeting of directors and supervisors to establish free primary schools, completely free of charge. It has also appointed a preparatory committee of fifteen people, including Yao Jinxiang, Liu Xianglin, and Zhang Zhan. We have also heard that the union, within its capabilities, may also establish welfare undertakings such as scholarship funds and clinics.</p>
<h3>Filial Piety Does Not Wane</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Zhuojun wrote a letter saying: "Respectfully, the 12th of this month is the first anniversary of the death of my late mother (Madam He Peifang). Recalling my late mother's lifelong love of benevolence, it is a pity that she was always limited by her ability, which she considered a regret. Therefore, on the anniversary of her death, I am sending 10,000 national currency notes, asking that 5,000 yuan be allocated to the nursing home and 5,000 yuan be used for winter clothing and gruel distribution, to continue my late mother's legacy and to commemorate her."</p>
<h3>Xujiahui Library's Book Purchase Donation Campaign</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Catholic Church Library, founded in 1847, is the earliest and largest library in Shanghai, with a collection of more than 300,000 Chinese and Western books and more than 2,800 local chronicles of various provinces, prefectures, and counties. The *Shen Bao* newspaper from the first issue to today is completely intact. However, since the Incident, it has suffered from a lack of funds, and many rare books have been missed. Therefore, from December 1st to the end of December, a donation campaign was launched with a target of 2 million yuan to fund book purchases. Considering that there is no shortage of cultural enthusiasts in Shanghai, we deeply hope that they will generously donate and complete this beautiful endeavor so that the library can purchase more books, preserve our country's culture, and pass it on to future generations. The sincerity of this is a prayer. We will collect the donations on behalf of the library.</p>
