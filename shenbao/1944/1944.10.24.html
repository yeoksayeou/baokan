<h3 id="c1">代評依賴英美抑獨立解放 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>二十三日晚，彬龢應上海電台之约，作對渝廣播，爰將講詞節錄移載於後，尚祈　讀者垂察是幸。　　重慶政權目前是在依賴英美繼續拖戰的局面，可是，我們站在整個中國的立塲，國家民族前途利益的立塲，必須權衡輕重，不能盲目的作無謂之犧牲。重慶所以依賴英美的理由，不外兩點，其一是相信英美的力量，足以擊潰日本，然後可以恢復中國的領土與主權。其二是懷疑日本的對華政策，是假意的，懷疑日本所領導的大東亞主義是虛偽的，多以，不如依賴英美而牽制日本。　　現在，我們就假定重慶所根據的理由，加以檢討，是否正確？是否有實現的可能？　　第一，相信英美的力量，足以擊潰日本。關於這點，我們不必從遠處的理論分析，僅就最近的事實觀察，已足充分證明爲毫無大陸戰塲以來，洛陽，長沙，衡陽等地，相繼失陷。現在桂林也旦夕危殆。上面幾個地方，無論是軍事上，政治上，經濟上都佔極重要的地位。尤其是衡陽佔領以後，從此可以解除和平地域以及日本空襲的最大威脅。並可以進而打通京漢粵漢兩路，促進大東亞大陸鐵道的全縣貫通，使大陸與南陽打成一片。所以在重慶堅持依賴英美而拖戰的觀點上而言，這幾個重要地方的失陷，無疑是不可挽回的致命打擊，也是根本打破相信英美的力量，擊潰日本的夢想。　　反過來說，美國的駐渝軍力，在最近幾次大陸戰役中，當然已經使用最大的力量，協同渝軍作戰，可是，結果還是着着失敗，這就證明英美援渝力量的脆弱。　　其次，也許有人說，在中國大陸作戰，英美因爲輸送的限制，對於重慶不能幫助更打的軍力，所以，爲日本所敗。但是，這點不能視爲美國力量就不足以擊潰日本的。這些觀點，過去也許有一部分人相信。現在也有事實證明了，就是這次台灣海面戰役，敵美是以太平洋最精銳的主力艦隊，最完備的機動部隊，準備對日軍作一次主力決戰的，可是，經日軍的奮勇應戰，將敵美出動的艦隊擊潰，從這次戰役中，更足以證明不但敵美沒有擊潰日本的力量，反之，日本則保有擊潰敵美的力量，這是重慶政權相信英美力量擊潰日本的理由，根本不能存在的有力反證。　　同時，我們更應認識英美所以縱恿重慶拖戰，當然有其侵略的野心。這次敵美更想在重慶地位中挽回頹勢，極力調停渝共糾紛，其實又是重慶落入敵美的圈套，飲鴆止渴，無補實際的。最近國慶日周恩來在延安所作的演講說：［現在中國正面戰塲是處在戰重失敗之中，河南戰役四十四天工夫失了許多城市。湘桂戰役又連失長沙，零陵，實慶，肇慶，梧州等這樣多的城市，現在日軍已迫近桂林，威脅柳州，甚至昆明。貴陽亦成爲日軍窺伺的目標。沿海戰役溫州福州相機失守，從此沿海交大的港口都不在我們手裏了。這連串失敗的事情爲什麽近年會連續發生呢？決非偶然的，而是由於國民黨政府歷來片面抗戰依賴外援製造內戰的政策所造成的。］我們看了這段話，當然知道周恩來是站在共產黨反重慶的立塲所說的，但是從此却可暴露重慶軍事方面的弱點，以及英美外援的絕不可靠的跡象。更足證明依賴英美擊潰日本完全是絕對做不到的夢想。　　第二，重慶認爲日本隊華新政策以及大東亞主義的虛偽一點，在大東亞會議以後，在和平區方面，中日關係的進步以及各國家的獨立自主，已有事實證明，母待鞪論。本月二十日日小磯首相在東京國民大會席上說：［目下日軍在中國雖仍作戰，然而此作戰非以中國民鐘爲敵，亦非以中國民眾爲對象，亦非以中國軍隊爲對象，甚至不依英美勢力者，雖重慶軍隊，亦不已之爲敵，渝方不特未能認識中國本身之真正敵人，反而爲真正敵人所主使，妄自對日本發動無益之抗戰，致使真正敵人愈益跋扈。］這幾句話裏，更已充分表示日本對中國對英美的絕不相同的態度。我們不能不加以明辦而決定我們的途徑。　　重慶的依賴英美，是自絕於大東亞，是自取滅亡，不然，環顧當前的情勢，推想國加的前途，就須摒絕英美，實現大東亞主義，完成獨立解放。孰棄孰從，凡是中國人民，目前已至從速取決的關頭了。[P日軍在雷伊泰島逐步增強反擊力日空軍迭重創地機動部隊&gt;</p>
<p>○東京二十三日中央社電　敵人自以運輸船之大部隊侵入雷伊泰灣，繼又企圖於塔克羅班附近登陸，茲日軍刻正與之邀擊中。同時，日空軍亦屢次攻擊低運輸船及護送船團，而獲得莫大戰果，日大本營會於二十二日發表，二十一日炸毀敵驅逐艦而搜，運輸船而搜起火，焚燒航空母艦一艘，十九日敵機動部隊（包括航空母艦二艘，戰艦二艘，巡洋艦二艘，驅逐艦三艘）曾來襲加尼科山島，嗣經日空軍邀擊後，亦獲莫大戰果，日大本營曾於二十日發表，炸沉敵航空母艦及驅逐各一艘（因日機三架衝撞敵艦而沉沒者），炸毀戰艦及驅逐艦各一艘。　　○東京二十三日中央社電　本月十九日，美軍侵略菲律賓之雷伊泰灣以來只作戰經過如此：十七日晨，暴風　雨，風速已至三十五米，因此，拂曉以來侵入雷伊泰灣之敵艦船，並無所行動，即入暗夜，十八日敵軍靜候天氣恢復後，即派遣艦戰機空襲比薩牙地區及呂宋島等，下午戰艦等靠近海岸，開始艦砲射擊，其後似作登陸準備，十九日九時後，敵軍一部於雷伊泰島南部至卡巴壳登陸，自正午起，敵軍於砲擊掩護下，擬於塔克羅班附近奇襲登陸，然日軍對此加以邀擊，予以重創，將之艦及大型船各一艘，目下美軍對菲律賓之攻擊已形軟化，僅出動小規模之作戰。反之，日軍正在逐步強化反擊力量，故敵軍利用增援兵力，以進行本格化之侵攻，實困難至極也。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日軍精銳已包圍韶關市內情形極緊張 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>○廣州二十三日中央社電　日軍精銳已自南北呼應，將渝軍第七戰區余漢謀之根據地韶關，完全包圍。最近該地發行之建國日報及大光報，曾高呼戰火迫近韶關，其文有謂過去韶關曾分設市政府。，其事務移交縣政府管理。過去縣政府特設置韶關八縣民眾自衛委員會，担任指揮民眾之武裝，並新設義勇警察隊，大事擴充防空組織。當局更講究各種防衛施策，然一般人民反持傍觀態度，希求戰火不波及該地。事故民眾武裝組織未有進展，觀此情勢，似不能阻止日軍之猛攻。然據另息，當局之管制日趨緊張，郵電完全停止，交通亦予限制。之新性格</p>
<p>○大陸前綫二十三日中央社電　今日以飛機量之侵劣，決定空戰之勝負，故空戰已一變其相貌，由個人只戰鬥轉入集團之戰鬥。渝軍於衡陽陷落前，僅以二十架左右分散來襲，最近九月中旬，兩次來襲新墻，竟以四時餘架之編隊出擊。十月十五日白晝強襲廣東時，竟以戰炸聯合五十架之編隊出動。九月十五日華中新墻之空戰，恰如在大空廣塲中奪球一般只激烈。每次日機接到渝機來襲消息後，立即騰空組成編隊，數分鐘後，突入渝機中央，渝機亦同樣來襲，數匯合後，即展開風車般之空中激戰。此種激戰，已不容單機戰鬥，必須結成編隊作戰，此乃最近大陸空戰之新性格。</p>

<p>○廣州二十三日中央社電　重慶當局由於中國西南遭日軍之壓迫，及蒙受重大打擊，甚爲焦慮。十四日渝軍委會副總參謀長白崇禧，特發表告桂省民眾書，呼籲全省壯丁武裝。頃據重慶電，索較平靜之昆明，刻因渝軍之薄弱，及日軍急速之推擊。似亦感受威脅，刻爲防衛計，已決定組織國民兵團。首先於二十日發表，十八歲至四十五歲男子，召集命令，施以二月間之軍事訓練後，配置於市內各處，以充防務。</p>

<p>○緬甸基地二十三日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府樹立以週年紀念週間之第一日爲軍事日，次日爲期使民眾明瞭國民軍伊姆法爾從軍之情形極飽斯以次佔領地行政長官視察前綫之情景等，特在各地帶舉行印緬戰綫照片巡迴展覽會。又二是二日緬甸本地舉行之民眾大會中，飽斯主席曾蒞席講演，謂後方民眾對印度解放史上大規模之武力抗爭，予以人力物力援助，本人深爲銘感，過去一年間，已有光輝之成果，願與民眾共同祝福，今後爲準備作戰，不惜一切犧牲。並且望民眾奮起，以獲得最後勝利。巴莫發表慶祝聲明</p>
<p>○仰光二十三日中央社電　緬甸國家代表巴莫，當自由印度離市政府成立一週年紀念日之際，特作慶祝證明，要旨如次：印度及其國民之解放，實爲世界史中之大胆且偉大之事業，且冥精神力與肉體力之偉大，更爲世無其匹。解放印度之大任，厥在自由政府及其前衛之國民軍雙肩之上，自由印度臨時政府在東亞人及印度國民軍，由於過去一年間之努力，已顯示絕能完成此大業之精神。即於此次作戰中，已完全發揮其戰鬥力，彼等於此等作戰後，咸以［若不解放印度民眾絕不甘休］之決意，作戰中之印度國民軍及其指揮官，在鮑斯氏領導下之奮鬥，以及印度臨時政府之過去一年間之事業，余認爲完成解放印度之大業，已臻現實，茲僅於此再表祝意，同時確信最後勝利必能到來。立法院例會</p>
<p>○南京二十三日中央社電　立法會二十三日在該院會議廳，舉行第一零七次會議，陳院長主席。中共要求渝方組織立政府</p>
<p>○中央社訊　關於渝共合作，前途井不樂觀，困難重重，而共黨一再要求渝政權改組，建立聯立政府，因此渝方內心苦悶異常，內外前迫。頃據可靠方面消息，所述頗詳，聞雙十節日，延安陝甘寧邊區政府舉行之慶祝大會中，有美軍事視察團之參加，井有朱德，毛澤東及各共黨幹部之參加。當時大會特別注意者，即周恩來所發表之演說，表示共黨本身之立場，其演說要點謂，此次在渝方所舉行之參政會議中，蔣介石所表示之渝共問題，以政治辦法解決之，當時并決定派參政員五人赴延安，本人當深表歡迎。惟欲挽救渝方知危機，及應付當前時局之要求，唯一正當辦法，即須由各黨各派，選擇人事參加聯立政府，及聯合統帥部之設立。因此欲要求渝方承認，得參加［抗戰］全部軍隊，及民　所選舉而建設之民主政府。查延安向對渝方要求改組政府，及改組軍事委員會，採用各派人事參加聯立政府及軍事機構。尤其策動各黨派，要求渝府，除渝國民黨外，莫不粉起，故改組政府之空氣，　漫內地。此種民主主義新的要求，獲得英美之同同情與贊，蓋英美之目的，乃犧牲中國，應付日本，實爲英美一貫制目標。而共黨表示欲達到目的，必須整個團結，反之，則渝共合作，對英美實供給有力的條件。所以渝方亦陷於困難之境，渝宣傳部長梁寒操，於本月十六日發表談話稱，渝共交涉如今已遭遇真正困難，實　不可否認的。惟渝方決心下極大地忍耐，繼續交涉，此項苦悶之論調，一方面渝方特將渝共事件利用國際上宣傳，並爲防止國際宣傳之不利起見，最近再加強檢閱新聞消息。　倫敦泰晤士報駐渝特派員，向國內報館當局發電稱，渝軍事當局最近檢閱程度更爲嚴重，所撰述之關於延安消息，及重要新聞均被檢去，不能發表，同時尚有好友十人，所著稿件，亦被刪檢，不得發電。如今渝方對共黨之交涉，一面應付共黨外，一面又向英美表示苦悶，不管仰人鼻息。</p>

<p>— 鶴齡</p>
<p>黑人的奮鬥</p>
<p>黑人教育家兼指導者的名人布加．華盛頓，宗教家瑪加斯．伽維等，爲黑人之社會地位的向上而奮鬥。布加．華盛頓會說：　　［白人似乎可以打敗我們，但我們黑人也可以打勝白人。］這是婉曲地表示他們的鬥爭意識的話。　　前次歐洲大戰以後，黑人的地位，無論在經濟上，政治上，人格上，都逐漸提高了。致富者很多，受大學教育者也增加，尤以美國西體育界嶄然露其頭角。大學的足球選手，黑臉的漸漸多起來了。　　此外，如在汽車比塞中，游泳中，黑人都已出人頭地。即白人也承認黑人當兵另有其優秀性。　　華府軍縮會議時，一部份美人已經在呌着，日美如進入交戰狀態，日本必喚起美國的黑人，發動叛亂。時至今日，日美已交戰對於日本德哧哧戰果，以及在英美壓迫下中國，菲島，緬甸，泰國等諸民族相繼解放，使各得其所，更擬使印度民眾獲得解放獨立，等等，對此種種日本的公正態度，美國民眾最所恐懼者，由於這日本的民族解放運動，勢必引起國內黑人的覺醒與叛亂。以前美國共產黨頗重視黑人對美人社會的反感之日趨熾烈，而利用之企圖使合眾國解體，即在今日，黑人中尚有相當共產黨分，且漸在增加中。他們當然在與蘇聯密切聯絡下活動，前黑人新聞記者却多特．奧爾在莫斯科的宣傳部，向美國的黑人社會大爲活躍。無疑的，時機一到，黑人必將參加反美的革命。他們歷年來從白人那裏所受到的冷淡，侮辱，迫害，差別待遇等，而發生的反感，不能不有一個時期爆發吧！最近美國黑人之社會的，政治的活動，特別顯著。一九三六年羅斯第二屆總選戰時，黑人選舉運動委員會在委員長Ｒ．Ｒ賴脫博士的統率下，得華盛頓的黑人教會牧師名廣播家愛達賴脫夫脫等的協力，向居位在北部地方的黑人呼籲，結果，北部地方黑人投票的七十至八十％投票選羅斯福。　　這運動達最高潮的時候，前黑人的同情者有名的羅斯福文人，出席黑人委員會，讚美黑人，黑人等大爲欣悅。伺年十月，選舉前，在紐約市麥蓋森．斯古愛．伽台萊舉行支持羅斯福大演說會時，黑人羣集者實達一萬六千人，爲有史以來的黑人最大集會。散居北部十七州的黑人投票數，不像南部那樣混亂，他們黑人的投票，完全站在一條陣綫，甚至握選舉者勝敗得關鍵。黑人國體頗多，其最有名者爲黑人國民集會。現任會長Ａ菲列普．賴杜爾甫爲黑人鐵道從業員互助會的會長，幹事約翰．Ｐ台維新，白倍特大學卒業後，在哈佛大學專攻法律的黑人關士，爲該會的創始人之一，該會的實權，他一手包辦。黑人國民會議</p>
<p>黑人國民議會從事於黑人的一致團結與強化其共同責任，統轄所屬許多黑人團體。其最除的黑人協議會一九三六年舉行於支加哥市，參加的各黑人團體代表約千餘人。　　此後，勢力一年一年擴大起來，現在南部的褚黑人青年團體亦均參加。又在聖路易有阿班季格氏者，統帥四十八個黑人團體。他們發其市內黑人經營的賭博塲及四娼窟等的閉鎖運動，着手擁護黑人的權利。例如，以黑人爲顧客的某商店，因人種的偏見，拒絕僱傭黑人爲店員，阿班季格氏立即令所屬團體對商店發動抵制運動。因此，黑人顧客裏足不前，該商店營業一簇不振，店主乃終於容納阿班季格氏的要求，僱傭黑人店員，時間始告解決。又某次阿班季格氏以書面送致該市某大牛乳送達會社長，僱傭黑人配達著以謀黑人的便利。公司置之不理。於是季格氏的代表訪問社長，重申其要求。然該公司仍不歡迎黑人配達人的入社。乃向別家公司申述同樣要求。那公司立即允諾僱傭六個黑人配達人。這公司的牛乳分送申請數，翌日激增了四○％，反之，那拒絕僱傭黑人配達人的公司，其銷路反比例的激減。　　黑人團體的標語爲　　［不要像僱傭褚君　　的商店購物。］</p>
<p>從最近黑人對白人經濟抗戰上可分商店的　顠爲三種：</p>
<p>一，全部由黑人經　　營的商店稱黑面孔　　（Ｂｌａｃｋ　ｆａｃｅ）　　二，黑人與白人混　　合德店稱黑茶色（　　Ｂｌａｃｋ　ｔａｎ）　　三，全部白人的店　　稱百合色　（Ｌｉｌｙ　　ｗｈｉｔｅ）　　黑人購物，以此等級。這一運動現已盛行於黑人之間了。　　最近黑人開始其顯著活動的地方，表現着將來有力的宿命的鬥爭精神。（完）</p>

<p>愈勝利內心愈堅定</p>
<p>這一次我們從台灣海面接到了一個期待已久的大勝消息，本人和各位同樣的衷心慶賀，但是日本有一句俗話，呌做［愈勝利內心愈應堅定］，這就是說勝利的時候，不存　傲的心理，反而加強信念，充分準備下次的作戰。以期再有更大的後獲。這一次的勝利實在是非常偉大的戰果，但是我敢在這裏說，美國決不是一個因此攻擊而肯死心的敵人，他必然要重振士氣挽回大敗，而作更猛烈的掙扎。南方別動隊麥克沃塞得部隊，已經來襲菲律賓在雷伊泰島登陸，恐怕敵方的企圖，還不止於此。對於我日本本土，或中國大陸直接攻擊，同時更可以想像得到的，就是今後在渝美空軍的蠢動，當然更加猛烈。可是敵方如果重振旗鼓來作盲目攻擊的話，站在我們這一方面，真是一個無上絕好的機會，如果敵人今後再作無謀侵犯，無論他到任何方面來，必然重蹈台灣海面的覆轍，這種趨勢已經非常明顯。敵方現在承認進攻菲列賓雷伊泰島的美軍，正在作毫無希望的苦戰，而我日本大本營昨天已經發表雷伊泰島的赫赫戰果，由此更可斷定，這一方面敵人的命運了。內衛陣綫固若金湯</p>
<p>不過敵美爲了羅斯福競選第四屆總統，把握國內民心起見，大概會再來一次冒險的舉動，大戰還在今後，真正的勝利，亦在今後，現在正是［愈勝利內心愈應堅定］的時候。敵人在台灣海面的失敗，這是當然的失敗，爲何要說他是當然的失敗呢？因爲我日本內綫防衛振是堅如金城湯池，他來輕舉妄動，真是自取滅亡，那末金城湯池的內綫防衛陣，是怎麼樣一件東西呢？我們先就其　成來看：第一，就是現在太平洋上由北到南的戰綫，第二，就是中國大陸的戰綫。太平洋的第一綫暫時不談，我單就大陸戰綫來講，在中國大陸的戰略綫，最大的戰略綫，最近席捲河南湖南兩省，又深入廣西省，其要衛桂林已在指顧之間，如此和華北的戰綫呼應，形成了縱觀大陸南北的戰綫，同時在中國海上控制廣東福建浙江三省的海岸綫要衛，在整個海岸綫上，怖下了水隙不漏的配備。再論到大陸戰略綫的任務：第一，要壓制敵美在渝空軍的蠢動，這一個效果已予敵美嚴重的教訓，使他企圖發動的太平洋上總反攻，發生重大障礙。第二，應付敵美直接侵犯大陸的築固防衛，於是敵方誇稱的大陸登陸作戰，終究是不可能的儘量協力掃蕩英美</p>
<p>但是敵方還沒有拋棄他的野心，希圖對台灣或菲律賓進攻，一方面是想截斷我日本的軍需資源，同時另一方面想進而侵犯中國大陸，希圖用武力侵略東亞。可是日本軍隨時把敵方的行動摧毀，又進而轉爲攻勢。我方的必勝戰略形勢，已經堅如磐石，那末，這個必勝形勢是怎樣確立的呢？就是我日本方面前綫將士，與後方產生陣營，打成一片，集中總力來擊滅英美，而且大東亞各友邦相互提携，儘量協力，向掃蕩英美之途邁進，尤負起了很大的任務，尤其是盟邦中國，對敵國關係毅然宣戰，加強兩國關係，以因公忘私的精神，向共同目的邁進，這種壯舉，實不勝感激。決勝的戰爭，還在今後，就是戰爭的局面，亦將更加激烈，非把醜敵英美徹底消滅，而獲得最後勝利，決不中止，本人願在此與各位共勉。</p>

<p>此次盟邦日本陸海空軍在台灣海戰中所發揮的強大威力，所獲得的赫赫戰果，以及現在方在進行中的菲律賓之戰的經過情形，相信各位都非常清楚。我現在想向各位說的，只是我個人對此次偉大的勝利的一點感想而已。糾正觀念</p>
<p>第一，對於此次台灣海戰，能夠真證明白其與中國今後的關係的國人，固然很多，但還有不少的人，對於此次海戰，還認爲只是日本和美國的戰爭，與中國本身，似乎並沒有什麽關係，這一種觀念，是應該要加以糾正的。這種認識完全是差誤的，爲什麽呢？我們不是在很早以前，就已知道敵美的司令官尼米資大將的計劃和宣傳，要在中國大陸登陸嗎？那麼現在這次台灣海域的決戰，就是尼米資計劃中的中國大陸登陸作戰的前奏。他們想把台灣和菲律賓作爲他們進攻中國大陸的前進基地，我們明白了這一點，我們就會了解這次偉大勝利對於我們中國今後命運關係的重大了。在這次世界大戰中有一個國家的命運，很值得我們中國來警惕的，這就是法國。在歐戰初起時法國式受了英美的利用，結果是把自己國家作爲英美的犧牲，將自己的國土，供作戰場。在歐洲第二戰綫成立的當時，首先遭受到英美攻擊破壞蹂躪的是誰呢？仍然是法國，法國就是在這種兩面不討好的狀態下，是被英美犧牲了，我們眼見敵美要將中國大陸作爲完逐制新東亞的決勝塲所，將中國的土地人民物產，作爲完逐他們侵略野心的犧牲，而可不思奮起集中全國的總力協力盟邦來撲滅英美的侵略勢力嗎？驕兵必敗</p>
<p>第二，哀師必勝驕兵必敗，這雖然是中國的一句古話，但却是一句顧撲不破的至理名言。英美此次的進攻大東亞地域，是一種侵略的行動，我們的從事大東亞戰爭，是在保衛東亞的生存與解放，從而求取我們中國自身的獨立自主，英美式侵略者，我們是被侵略者，所以我們是哀師，何況自從塞班島大宮島褚役後，敵美獲得了一點小勝，就驕橫不堪，以這種志滿驕橫的侵略之師，和我們爲了保衛自己生存解放自由而戰的義軍作戰，敵美的失敗，乃是必然的。敵人雖然誇恃他們物資的優越，但我們由於精神和信念所產生的力量，與東亞十億民族共同努力奮戰，相信一定可以把英美的侵略努力擊滅的。共同努力</p>
<p>第三，中國革命的目的對內是求取中華民族的團結與統一，對外事在掙脫侵略勢力而爭取中國之自主獨立生存解放。一百餘年來的中國歷史上寫滿了英美對中國的侵略榨取蹂躪壓制的事實，中國始終渝於次殖民地地位，而不得翻身，這完全是受了英美之賜，現在在東亞解放戰爭已臨決勝階段，我們必須集中所有的物力人力，增強協力戰爭的體制。所以中國革命目的之完逐，中之國自由獨立之獲得，必須以東亞完成解放爲前提，假使東亞仍爲英美所制壓，那麼不僅大東亞永無解放之日，就是中國之生存復興，亦將完全絕望，所以我人於此實在已臨生死與亡之秋，我們爲求中國之自主獨立與生存復興，爲求東亞之自由與解放，必與東亞各民族共同努力，以必勝之決心與信念，奮起寂滅英美，完逐戰爭，復與中華，保衛東亞。</p>

<p>第二十四次記者例會，昨（二十三）日上午十假江西路市府會議室照常時舉行，由市宣傳處秘書潘比德代表梁處長出席主持，報告商統會書面答覆本市各社記者所提出之各項問題，茲特將各項問答摘錄如次：米糧問題問米統會</p>
<p>一中央社問：戰時一切措施，原以軍事第一爲原則，但蓋戰必須養民，養民即所以養戰，亦爲不易之常理，此點主席曾有所昭示，今軍米民　　間其統籌　　之道雜何，對軍需米之供應如何充裕，對民貪米之配給，有何保障？　　二中央社問：現在各地收米情形如何，農民事否實受其利，中間有無不良份子乘機剝削，操縱之　　三中央社問：現在本市收米之價格若干，其價格之標準如何決定，曾否與物價評議會商洽？　　四中華日報社問：米價爲物價之主要因素，欲抑平物價，必先抑平米價，目前米價暴　，致刺激其他物價一致上漲，請問商統會當局，對米價問題如何處理？　　五中華日報社問：本市戶口米配給數量過少，市民不能不求之黑市，而黑市米因限制自由入口，存量又微，以致供不應求，市民枵靝以待，過去有人建議或增加戶口米之配給，或放寬入口米之限制，未悉米統會對此兩種意見，可否擇一採用，抑另有其他良策，以濟民食，而雜生計？　　答：查上開五條，俱屬米糧問題，較為重要，應函請米糧統制委員會解答，以資簡捷。配給麵粉加價原因</p>
<p>六平報社問：麵粉配給價增加一倍又半，盼說明原因。　　答：麵粉配給價格增加一倍又半，現因按照新定收買小麥價格，製粉成本較大，一切加之運輸等費，又因各種物價綱統增高，莫不隨之加增，故對於前訂各地區麵粉麩皮價格，自須重行核定，俾可平衡收支與各關係方面幾度治商，詳加研討，認爲確有調整必要，業由粉麥統制委員會逕行呈報行政院，並函報商統會矣。戶口棉布下期配給</p>

<p>十二中華日報問：本市統制工作，始終枝節從事，未能步入正軌，究爲機構組織爲臻完善，抑因人事不減，請加以解脫。　　答：物資統制之於民國，尚屬創舉，誠所謂事無前例，人乏經　，推行之際，未免枝節　生，雖友邦統制成績，足資借鏡，然以國情互異，有不甚相宜之處，現在實施統制已經年餘，正逐步調整之中，此後自可漸入正軌。　　十三中華日報問：各報社記者對商統會消息採訪，常有無人負責聯絡情形，致與外界頗多隔蘭，同時如有所探詢，亦多答非所問，不得要領，徒勞往返，希望今後能設法改善。　　答：查本會關於編發新聞，公佈消息，歷來派有編纂秘書專司其事，惟因本年七月間變更內部組織，以後所有物資統制事宜，其重心已分別移轉所屬各統制委員會辦理，有時新聞記者來本會探詢實施各項物資統制現狀時，容有不能立時作解答，更有時記者來會所接見者，非負有專責人員，以致未能切實解答，亦屬難免之事，今後自當飭屬，隨時注意。　　十四中華日報問：本市統制工作，開始迄今，每對當地情形，不加深切考察，以致朝令夕改，反將物價刺激上騰，影響民生基　，請問其原因何在？　　答：查統制命令之更改，容有環境事實上之不得不予變更，並非一切統制命令，俱有更易，茲所調［朝令夕改］未悉係指何項命令而言，應請分別說明，以便答覆。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Relying on England and America or Independent Liberation - A Critical Review <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>On the evening of the 23rd, Binhe was invited by Shanghai Radio to broadcast to Chongqing. Herewith is an excerpt of the speech, hoping for the readers' kind attention.</p>
<p>The Chongqing government is currently in a situation of relying on England and America to continue the protracted war. However, from the standpoint of the entire China, and the future interests of the nation, we must weigh the pros and cons and not blindly make meaningless sacrifices. The reasons why Chongqing relies on England and America are no more than two points: Firstly, it believes that the power of England and America is sufficient to defeat Japan, and then restore China's territory and sovereignty. Secondly, it suspects that Japan's policy toward China is insincere, and that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere led by Japan is hypocritical. Therefore, it is better to rely on England and America to contain Japan.</p>
<p>Now, let us assume that the reasons Chongqing relies on are correct. Is there any possibility of realization?</p>
<p>First, believing that the power of England and America is sufficient to defeat Japan. Regarding this point, we do not need to analyze from remote theories. Simply observing the recent facts is enough to fully prove it. Since there has been a mainland battlefield, Luoyang, Changsha, Hengyang and other places have fallen one after another. Now Guilin is also in imminent danger. The above places all occupy extremely important positions in terms of military, politics, and economy. Especially after the occupation of Hengyang, the greatest threat of peace areas and Japanese air raids can be lifted. It can also further open up the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou railways, promote the full connection of the Greater East Asia continental railway, and integrate the mainland with Nanyang. Therefore, from the perspective of Chongqing's insistence on relying on England and America to protract the war, the loss of these important places is undoubtedly an irreparable fatal blow, and it also fundamentally shatters the dream of believing that the power of England and America can defeat Japan.</p>
<p>Conversely, the US military strength stationed in Chongqing has of course used its greatest strength in the recent mainland battles to cooperate with the Chongqing army. However, the result is still repeated defeats, which proves the weakness of the British and American aid to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Secondly, perhaps some people will say that in the China mainland war, England and America cannot help Chongqing with more military strength due to the limitations of transportation, so they were defeated by Japan. However, this cannot be regarded as the lack of American power to defeat Japan. These views may have been believed by some people in the past. Now there is also evidence to prove that in this Taiwan naval battle, the enemy America used the most elite main fleet in the Pacific and the most complete mobile unit, preparing for a decisive battle against the Japanese army. However, after the Japanese army bravely responded, the enemy American fleet was defeated. This battle is enough to prove that not only does the enemy America not have the power to defeat Japan, but on the contrary, Japan has the power to defeat the enemy America. This is a powerful counter-evidence that the Chongqing government's belief that the power of England and America can defeat Japan cannot exist at all.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should also realize that England and America are conniving at Chongqing's protracted war, and of course they have their aggressive ambitions. This time, the enemy America wants to regain its declining momentum in Chongqing's position, and is trying its best to mediate the Chongqing-Communist disputes. In fact, Chongqing is falling into the trap of the enemy America, drinking poison to quench thirst, which is of no practical help. Recently, Zhou Enlai's speech in Yan'an on the National Day said: [The current Chinese frontal battlefield is in a state of heavy defeats. In the Henan campaign, many cities were lost in forty-four days. In the Xiang-Gui campaign, Changsha, Lingling, Shiqing, Zhaoqing, Wuzhou and other cities were lost in succession. Now the Japanese army is approaching Guilin, threatening Liuzhou, and even Kunming. Guiyang has also become the target of the Japanese army's covetousness. Wenzhou and Fuzhou were lost one after another in the coastal battles, and from then on, the major ports on the coast were no longer in our hands. Why have these series of failures occurred continuously in recent years? It is by no means accidental, but is caused by the Kuomintang government's consistent policy of unilateral resistance against Japan, relying on foreign aid, and creating civil war.] After reading this passage, we certainly know that Zhou Enlai is speaking from the standpoint of the Communist Party against Chongqing. However, from this, we can expose the weakness of Chongqing's military and the absolutely unreliable signs of British and American foreign aid. It is even more proof that relying on England and America to defeat Japan is a completely impossible dream.</p>
<p>Second, Chongqing believes that Japan's new policy toward China and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are hypocritical. After the Greater East Asia Conference, in the peaceful areas, the progress of Sino-Japanese relations and the independence and autonomy of various countries have been proven by facts. On the 20th of this month, Japanese Prime Minister Koiso said at the Tokyo National Assembly: [At present, the Japanese army is still fighting in China, but this battle is not against the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese people, nor is it aimed at the Chinese army, and even those who do not rely on British and American forces, even the Chongqing army, are not regarded as enemies. Chongqing not only fails to recognize the real enemy of China itself, but is manipulated by the real enemy, and recklessly launches a useless war of resistance against Japan, which makes the real enemy even more rampant.] These few words fully express Japan's completely different attitude toward China and toward England and America. We must clearly distinguish and decide our path.</p>
<p>Chongqing's reliance on England and America is self-defeating from Greater East Asia, and is self-destruction. Otherwise, looking around at the current situation and considering the future of the country, we must reject England and America, realize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and achieve independent liberation. What to abandon and what to follow, all Chinese people have reached the critical moment of making a decision as soon as possible.</p>
<p>[PThe Japanese army is gradually increasing its counterattack force on Leyte Island, and the Japanese air force has repeatedly severely damaged the enemy's mobile unit]</p>
<p>○Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency - The enemy invaded Leyte Bay with a large unit of transport ships, and then attempted to land near Tacloban. The Japanese army is currently intercepting it. At the same time, the Japanese air force has repeatedly attacked low transport ships and escort convoys, and achieved great results. The Japanese headquarters announced on the 22nd that on the 21st, an enemy destroyer was destroyed and searched, a transport ship was searched and caught fire, and an aircraft carrier was burned. On the 19th, the enemy mobile unit (including two aircraft carriers, two battleships, two cruisers, and three destroyers) attacked Kaniko Mountain Island. After the Japanese air force intercepted it, it also achieved great results. The Japanese headquarters announced on the 20th that one enemy aircraft carrier and one destroyer were sunk (caused by three Japanese aircraft colliding with the enemy ships and sinking), and one battleship and one destroyer were destroyed.</p>
<p>○Tokyo, 23rd, Central News Agency - The battle since the US military invaded Leyte Bay in the Philippines on the 19th of this month has been as follows: On the morning of the 17th, there was a storm with wind speeds of up to 35 meters. Therefore, the enemy ships that invaded Leyte Bay since dawn did not move. Into the dark night, on the 18th, the enemy army waited for the weather to recover, and then sent carrier-based aircraft to bomb the Bisaya area and Luzon Island, etc. In the afternoon, battleships and other ships approached the coast and began naval gun bombardment, and then seemed to prepare for landing. After 9 o'clock on the 19th, a part of the enemy army landed from the south of Leyte Island to Kabak. From noon onwards, the enemy army, under the cover of artillery fire, planned to attack Tacloban by surprise landing. However, the Japanese army intercepted it and inflicted heavy damage on it, sinking one ship and one large ship. At present, the US military's attack on the Philippines has softened, and only small-scale operations have been dispatched. On the contrary, the Japanese army is gradually strengthening its counterattack force. Therefore, it is extremely difficult for the enemy army to use reinforcements to carry out a full-scale invasion.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Army's Elite Has Surrounded Shaoguan City, and the Situation Is Extremely Tense <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>○Guangzhou, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Japanese army's elite has responded from the north and south, completely surrounding Shaoguan, the base of Yu Hanmou, the seventh theater of the Chongqing army. Recently, the Jianguo Daily and Daguang Daily, which were published in the area, cried out that the flames of war were approaching Shaoguan. The article said that Shaoguan had previously established a municipal government, and its affairs were transferred to the county government. In the past, the county government specially set up the Shaoguan Eight County People's Self-Defense Committee to take charge of the armed forces of the people, and newly established a volunteer police team to greatly expand the air defense organization. The authorities are also studying various defense measures, but the general people are holding a bystander attitude, hoping that the flames of war will not affect the area. Therefore, the people's armed organization has not made progress, and judging from this situation, it seems that it cannot prevent the Japanese army's fierce attack. However, according to another source, the authorities' control is becoming increasingly tense, postal and telecommunications have been completely suspended, and transportation has also been restricted.</p>
<p>○Continental Front, 23rd, Central News Agency - Today, the number of aircraft determines the outcome of the air battle, so the air battle has changed its appearance, from individual combat to group combat. Before the fall of Hengyang, the Chongqing army only attacked with about 20 aircraft scattered. Recently, in mid-September, they attacked Xinqiang twice, and actually dispatched a formation of more than 40 aircraft. When they raided Guangdong during the day on October 15, they dispatched a formation of 50 fighter-bombers. The air battle at Xinqiang in Central China on September 15 was as fierce as a ball game in a large open space. Every time the Japanese aircraft received news of the Chongqing aircraft's attack, they immediately took off to form a formation, and after a few minutes, they broke into the center of the Chongqing aircraft. The Chongqing aircraft also attacked in the same way. After several convergences, they launched a windmill-like aerial battle. This kind of fierce battle does not allow single-aircraft combat, and must be carried out in formation. This is the new character of the recent continental air battle.</p>

<p>○South China Front Base, 23rd - Since the Japanese army in South China began on the 9th of last month, the Chongqing army has abandoned only 1,314 bodies according to reliable sources, 229 people have been captured, and the weapons seized include 6 mountain guns, 2 machine guns, 91 heavy machine guns, 107 machine guns, 2 automatic rifles, 83 rifles, 70 grenade launchers, 100,000 rounds of ammunition, 83 landmines, 2,000 naval mines, 46,550 helmets, 5,900 winter clothes, 3,875 summer clothes, 4,000 winter coats, and countless other military supplies.</p>
<p>○Guangzhou, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Chongqing authorities are very anxious because the southwest of China is being oppressed by the Japanese army and suffering heavy blows. On the 14th, Bai Chongxi, deputy chief of staff of the Chongqing Military Commission, specially published a letter to the people of Guangxi Province, calling on the strong men of the entire province to arm themselves. According to Chongqing electricity, Kunming, which is relatively peaceful, is now threatened due to the weakness of the Chongqing army and the rapid advance of the Japanese army. For the sake of defense, it has been decided to organize a national army. First, on the 20th, a summons order was issued to men aged 18 to 45, and after two months of military training, they were deployed in various parts of the city to serve as defense.</p>

Here, I would like to express my congratulations again, and at the same time, I am confident that the final victory will come.</p>
<p>○Nanjing, 23rd, Central News Agency - The Legislative Yuan held its 107th meeting in the Yuan's conference hall on the 23rd, chaired by Yuan Chang Chen.</p>
<p>○Central News Agency - Regarding the Chongqing-Communist cooperation, the future is not optimistic, and there are many difficulties. The Communist Party has repeatedly demanded that the Chongqing government be reorganized and a joint government be established. Therefore, the Chongqing side is extremely depressed and is being forced from both inside and outside. According to reliable sources, the details are quite detailed. It is said that the US military inspection team participated in the celebration held by the Yan'an Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government on the Double Tenth Festival, and Zhu De, Mao Zedong and other Communist Party cadres also participated. At that time, what the congress paid special attention to was Zhou Enlai's speech, which expressed the Communist Party's own position. The main points of his speech were that Chiang Kai-shek expressed the Chongqing-Communist issue in the Chongqing Congress, and decided to resolve it through political means. At that time, it was decided to send five councilors to Yan'an, and I would like to express my welcome. However, in order to save Chongqing's crisis and meet the requirements of the current situation, the only proper way is to select personnel from all parties and factions to participate in the joint government and the establishment of the joint command. Therefore, it is necessary to ask the Chongqing side to admit that it can participate in the entire [anti-Japanese] army and the democratic government elected and built by the people. Yan'an has always demanded that the Chongqing side reorganize the government and reorganize the Military Commission, and adopt personnel from all parties to participate in the joint government and military agencies. In particular, it has instigated all parties to demand that the Chongqing government, except for the Chongqing Kuomintang, all rise up. Therefore, the atmosphere of reorganizing the government has spread throughout the mainland. This new demand for democracy has won the sympathy and approval of England and America. The purpose of England and America is to sacrifice China to deal with Japan, which is the consistent goal of England and America. The Communist Party said that in order to achieve its goals, it must be united as a whole. Otherwise, the Chongqing-Communist cooperation will provide powerful conditions for England and America. Therefore, the Chongqing side is also in a difficult situation. Liang Hancao, the Minister of Propaganda of Chongqing, said in a speech on the 16th of this month that the Chongqing-Communist negotiations have now encountered real difficulties, which is undeniable. However, the Chongqing side is determined to exercise great patience and continue the negotiations. On the one hand, the Chongqing side uses the Chongqing-Communist incident for international propaganda, and in order to prevent the unfavorable international propaganda, it has recently strengthened the review of news. The London Times correspondent stationed in Chongqing telegraphed to the newspaper authorities in China, saying that the Chongqing military authorities have recently become more serious in their review. The news about Yan'an and important news are all checked and cannot be published. At the same time, there are also ten good friends whose manuscripts have also been deleted and cannot be telegraphed. Now, the Chongqing side is dealing with the Communist Party. On the one hand, it is dealing with the Communist Party. On the other hand, it is expressing its depression to England and America, regardless of relying on others' breath.</p>

<p>○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - German News Agency: Yesterday and last night, street battles between the German and Soviet armies took place in the city of Goldap in eastern East Prussia. The development of the situation on the East Prussian border has become serious. Southeast of Gumbinnen, the German army is currently counterattacking, and the air force detachment has been sent to the area to participate in defensive operations.</p>
<p>○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: On the sixth day of the Soviet army's attack on East Prussia, it has changed its strategy. Instead of attacking between Schirwindt and Suwalki, it is now using a large number of tanks to attack south of Gumbinnen. The Soviet army's goal is to break through the fortresses built by civilians in several weeks. So far, the German army has been able to repel the Soviet army's attack on a 110-kilometer line. South of Heath, several Soviet infantry divisions are concentrating their attack. The Soviet army first attacked with tanks, but the terrain was not suitable for tanks, and they retreated due to the German army's resistance. North of Warsaw, the Soviet army did not launch a large-scale attack, and the breakthrough points near Serock and Rosen have been blocked. A major war has broken out in the Baja area in southern Hungary (Baja is located on the right bank of the Danube, 150 kilometers from Hongjing), and the Soviet army in Szolnok has been encircled and annihilated. North of Debrecen, the Soviet army has invaded the city of Nyíregyháza, and the city of Hajdúhadház, halfway between the two cities, has been recaptured by the German army.</p>

<p>○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - German new weapons (pocket tanks) controlled by radio waves have recently been active on the Western Front, causing great distress to the Anti-Axis Forces. Recently, powerful new tank weapons have suddenly appeared on the battlefield, causing extreme fear to the Anti-Axis Forces. This new weapon is named the V4. According to reports, this type of tank is driven by a single driver to the designated target. Then, the driver disengages from the tank in front of the target, causing the tank to automatically launch radio waves, advancing towards the target. After releasing box-shaped naval mines upon reaching the target, it then releases smoke screens and returns to the German army's position.</p>
<p>○Berlin, 23rd, Central News Agency - Huitong News Agency: On the 21st, the focus of the battle on the Belgian-Dutch border was on the main road from Antwerp to Breda. The Canadian army advanced several kilometers in areas such as Heijt and Blijede. The intensity of the battle has increased without end. The Canadian army broke into Breskens on the 21st. The German army seems to have the intention of retreating to the northern passes of the Western Scheldt. However, occupying Breskens does not mean that Antwerp will be lost early. The Canadian First Army cannot easily subdue the artillery batteries of Hulst and South Beveland. Patrols from the British Second Army have appeared in the Nijmegen area and have been repelled. The battle west of Mount Frey has eased slightly. A soldier from Hawaii was captured for the first time. Information from him shows that the 442nd Regiment of the US Infantry is made up entirely of Hawaiians.</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Problem of Black People in America - 3 <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— He Ling</p>
<p>The Struggle of Black People</p>
<p>Booker T. Washington, a famous Black educator and leader, and Marcus Garvey, a religious figure, both struggled for the improvement of the social status of Black people. Booker T. Washington once said: "White people may seem to defeat us, but we Black people can also defeat white people." This is a euphemistic way of expressing their fighting spirit. Since the last European war, the status of Black people, whether economically, politically, or personally, has gradually improved. Many have become wealthy, and the number of those receiving university education has also increased, especially in the American sports world, where they have emerged prominently. More and more Black faces are appearing as university football players. In addition, Black people have also excelled in car races and swimming. Even white people acknowledge the excellence of Black people as soldiers. During the Washington Naval Conference, some Americans were already shouting that if Japan and the United States entered a state of war, Japan would definitely arouse Black people in America to launch a rebellion. Today, Japan and the United States are at war, and Japan's brilliant war results, as well as the successive liberation of the Chinese, Filipino, Burmese, and Thai nations under the oppression of Britain and the United States, allowing each to find its place, and even planning to liberate India and make it independent, etc. The American people are most afraid of Japan's just attitude in all of these things, because Japan's national liberation movement is bound to arouse the awakening and rebellion of Black people at home. In the past, the American Communist Party attached great importance to the increasingly intense resentment of Black people towards American society and attempted to use it to disintegrate the United States. Even today, there are still a considerable number of Communist Party members among Black people, and their numbers are gradually increasing. They are certainly operating in close contact with the Soviet Union. Former Black journalist Dorothy Orr is very active in the propaganda department in Moscow, reaching out to the Black community in America. Undoubtedly, when the time comes, Black people will definitely participate in anti-American revolution. The resentment they have accumulated over the years from the coldness, insults, persecution, and discrimination they have suffered from white people is bound to erupt at some point! Recently, the social and political activities of Black people in America have been particularly significant. During Roosevelt's second presidential election in 1936, the Black People's Election Movement Committee, under the leadership of Chairman R.R. Wright, with the cooperation of Washington's Black church pastor and broadcaster Ada Wright and others, appealed to Black people living in the northern regions. As a result, 70 to 80% of Black people in the northern regions voted for Roosevelt. When this movement reached its climax, famous Rooseveltian intellectuals who sympathized with Black people attended Black community meetings and praised Black people, much to the delight of the Black people. In October of the same year, before the election, when a large speech was held in New York City's Madison Square Garden to support Roosevelt, the Black crowd reached 16,000 people, the largest gathering of Black people in history. The number of Black votes scattered across the 17 northern states was not as chaotic as in the South. The Black people's votes were entirely on one front, even holding the key to the victory or defeat of the election. There are many Black national organizations, the most famous of which is the National Negro Congress. The current president, A. Philip Randolph, is the president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. The secretary, John P. Davis, a Black scholar who graduated from Bates College and majored in law at Harvard University, is one of the founders of the Congress, and he controls the real power of the organization.</p>
<p>National Negro Congress</p>
<p>The National Negro Congress is engaged in the united solidarity of Black people and the strengthening of their common responsibility, governing many Black groups under its jurisdiction. The first Black Congress was held in Chicago in 1936, with representatives from various Black groups participating, totaling more than 1,000 people. Since then, its influence has expanded year by year, and now the Black youth groups in the South have also joined. Also, in St. Louis, there is a man named Aban Tiggs, who commands 48 Black groups. They launched a movement to close down gambling dens and brothels run by Black people in the city, and began to defend the rights of Black people. For example, if a store that catered to Black customers refused to hire Black clerks due to racial prejudice, Aban Tiggs immediately ordered his affiliated groups to launch a boycott of the store. As a result, Black customers stopped coming, and the store's business plummeted. The store owner finally accepted Aban Tiggs' request and hired Black clerks, and the matter was resolved. Also, once, Aban Tiggs sent a letter to the president of a large milk delivery company in the city, requesting the employment of Black delivery men to serve Black customers. The company ignored it. So Tiggs' representative visited the president and reiterated his request. However, the company still did not welcome Black delivery men. Therefore, they made the same request to another company. That company immediately agreed to hire six Black delivery men. The number of delivery applications to this company increased by 40% the next day. In contrast, the company that refused to hire Black delivery men saw its sales decline proportionally. The slogan of the Black groups is:</p>
<p>"Don't shop at stores that don't hire Black people."</p>
<p>From the recent economic resistance of Black people against white people, stores can be divided into three types:</p>
<p>1. Stores run entirely by Black people are called Black Faces.</p>
<p>2. Stores run jointly by Black and white people are called Black Tan.</p>
<p>3. Stores run entirely by white people are called Lily White.</p>
<p>Black people shop according to this hierarchy. This movement is now prevalent among Black people. Recently, Black people have begun to engage in significant activities, showing a powerful spirit of destined struggle for the future. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e11">The Great Victory on the Seas off Taiwan Determines the Fate of the Enemy America: Minister Izubuchi's Valedictory Address <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The More Victorious, the More Steadfast in Heart</p>
<p>This time, we have received long-awaited news of a great victory from the seas off Taiwan. I, like everyone else, wholeheartedly congratulate you. However, there is a common saying in Japan: "The more victorious, the more steadfast in heart." This means that in times of victory, one should not harbor arrogance but rather strengthen one's beliefs and fully prepare for the next battle, in order to achieve even greater success. This victory is indeed a very great achievement, but I dare say here that America is by no means an enemy who will give up after being attacked in this way. It will inevitably regroup, recover from its great defeat, and make more violent struggles. The Southern Mobile Unit of the MacArthur's force has already attacked the Philippines, landing on Leyte Island. I am afraid that the enemy's intentions are more than just this. In addition to directly attacking our Japanese homeland or the Chinese mainland, it is also conceivable that the American air force in Chongqing will act even more violently. However, if the enemy regroups to make a blind attack, it is truly an excellent opportunity for us. If the enemy makes another reckless invasion in the future, no matter where it comes, it will inevitably repeat the mistakes made on the seas off Taiwan. This trend is already very obvious. The enemy now admits that the American troops attacking Leyte Island in the Philippines are engaged in a hopeless struggle, and our Japanese headquarters announced the resounding victory on Leyte Island yesterday. From this, we can even more determine the enemy's fate in this area. The inner defense line is as solid as a rock.</p>
<p>However, in order to secure the domestic public sentiment for Roosevelt's campaign for a fourth term as president, the enemy America will probably make another adventurous move. The great war is still ahead, and the real victory is also in the future. Now is the time to be "the more victorious, the more steadfast in heart." The enemy's failure on the seas off Taiwan is a natural failure. Why do I say it is a natural failure? Because our Japanese inner defense line is as solid as a rock, and for him to act rashly is truly asking for his own destruction. So, what exactly is this inner defense line that is as solid as a rock? Let's first look at its formation: First, it is the battle line from north to south in the Pacific Ocean; second, it is the battle line on the Chinese mainland. I will not discuss the first line in the Pacific for the time being, and I will focus on the battle line on the Chinese mainland. The largest strategic line on the Chinese mainland has recently swept through Henan and Hunan provinces, and has penetrated deep into Guangxi province, with its stronghold Guilin within sight. In this way, it echoes the battle line in North China, forming a battle line that runs north and south across the mainland. At the same time, it controls the coastal strongholds of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces on the Chinese sea, deploying a watertight defense line along the entire coastline. Let us now discuss the tasks of the mainland strategic line: First, to suppress the enemy's air force in Chongqing, this effect has already given the enemy a severe lesson, causing a major obstacle to his attempt to launch a general counteroffensive in the Pacific. Second, to cope with the enemy's direct invasion of the mainland with a strong defense. As a result, the enemy's boast of a mainland landing operation is ultimately impossible.</p>
<p>But the enemy has not abandoned his ambition, hoping to attack Taiwan or the Philippines. On the one hand, he wants to cut off Japan's military supplies and resources, and on the other hand, he wants to invade the Chinese mainland and try to use force to invade East Asia. However, the Japanese army is always ready to destroy the enemy's actions and then turn to the offensive. Our side's strategy for certain victory has been as firm as a rock. So, how was this strategy for certain victory established? It is that our Japanese soldiers on the front lines and the production camps in the rear are united, concentrating all their efforts to destroy Britain and the United States. Moreover, the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are cooperating with each other as much as possible, advancing towards the path of eliminating Britain and the United States, and have taken on a very large task. In particular, our ally China has resolutely declared war on the enemy countries, strengthened relations between the two countries, and is advancing towards a common goal with a spirit of selflessness. This is truly admirable. The decisive battle is still ahead, and the situation of the war will also become more intense. We will never stop until we have completely eliminated the ugly enemies Britain and the United States and achieved final victory. I would like to share this with everyone here.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Arrogant Soldiers Will Surely Be Defeated: Exterminate the Aggression of the Enemy America - Mr. Huang Jingzhai's Speech <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The powerful might displayed by the Allied Japanese army, navy, and air force in the naval battle off Taiwan, the resounding victories they have achieved, and the progress of the ongoing battle in the Philippines are all very clear to everyone, I believe. What I want to say to everyone now is just a few of my personal thoughts on this great victory.</p>
<p>Correcting Concepts</p>
<p>First, while there are many people in our country who can truly understand the relationship between this battle off Taiwan and China's future, there are still many people who regard this naval battle as merely a war between Japan and the United States, and it seems to have nothing to do with China itself. This kind of concept should be corrected. This understanding is completely wrong. Why? Didn't we know long ago that the enemy American commander-in-chief Admiral Nimitz's plan and propaganda was to land on the Chinese mainland? So, the decisive battle in the waters off Taiwan this time is the prelude to the Chinese mainland landing operation in Nimitz's plan. They want to use Taiwan and the Philippines as their forward bases for attacking the Chinese mainland. If we understand this point, we will understand the great significance of this great victory for the future destiny of our China. In this world war, there is a country whose destiny is very worthy of our China's vigilance, and that is France. At the beginning of the European war, France was exploited by Britain and the United States, and as a result, it made its own country a sacrifice for Britain and the United States, and used its own territory as a battlefield. When the Second Front in Europe was established, who was the first to suffer from the attacks, destruction, and trampling of Britain and the United States? It was still France. France was sacrificed by Britain and the United States in this kind of unenviable situation. We have seen that the enemy America wants to use the Chinese mainland as a decisive battlefield to completely destroy New East Asia, and use the land, people, and resources of China as a sacrifice to achieve their aggressive ambitions. Can we not think of rising up and concentrating the total strength of the whole country to cooperate with the allies to extinguish the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States?</p>
<p>Arrogant Soldiers Will Surely Be Defeated</p>
<p>Second, a mourning army will surely win, while an arrogant army will surely be defeated. Although this is an ancient Chinese saying, it is a truth that cannot be broken. The British and Americans' attack on the Greater East Asia region this time is an act of aggression. Our participation in the Greater East Asia War is to defend the survival and liberation of East Asia, and thereby seek our own independence, autonomy, and freedom for China. The British and Americans are aggressors, and we are the invaded, so we are a mourning army. Moreover, since the battles of Saipan and Guam, the enemy Americans have gained a little victory and become unbearably arrogant. To fight with this kind of conceited and arrogant aggressive army and our righteous army that is fighting to defend its own survival, liberation, and freedom, the failure of the enemy Americans is inevitable. Although the enemy boasts of their material superiority, we believe that we can definitely defeat the aggressive efforts of Britain and the United States with the power generated by our spirit and belief, and the joint efforts of the 1 billion people of East Asia.</p>
<p>Joint Efforts</p>
<p>Third, the goal of the Chinese revolution is to seek the unity and unification of the Chinese nation internally, and to break free from aggressive forces and strive for China's autonomy, independence, survival, and liberation externally. More than 100 years of Chinese history is filled with the facts of British and American aggression, exploitation, trampling, and suppression of China. China has always been in a semi-colonial position and cannot turn over. This is entirely due to Britain and the United States. Now that the East Asian liberation war has reached its decisive stage, we must concentrate all our material and human resources and strengthen the system of cooperative warfare. Therefore, the completion of the goal of the Chinese revolution, and the acquisition of China's freedom and independence, must take the completion of East Asian liberation as a prerequisite. If East Asia is still controlled by Britain and the United States, then not only will Greater East Asia never have a day of liberation, but China's survival and rejuvenation will also be completely hopeless. Therefore, we are now truly at a time of life and death. In order to seek China's autonomy, independence, survival, and rejuvenation, and in order to seek East Asia's freedom and liberation, we must work together with the nations of East Asia, with the determination and belief to win, rise up and eliminate Britain and the United States, complete the war, restore China, and defend East Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e13">In Order to Completely Maintain the Safety of Traffic and Communication and Expand Publicity, the Police Bureau of the City Will Launch a Traffic Safety Week <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>In order to maintain traffic safety as the top priority, the police in this city will launch a "Traffic Safety Week" starting on the 26th of this month, expanding publicity to ensure that the public deeply understands and strictly follows traffic rules. Yesterday (23rd) at 4:00 PM, a tea party was held in the club on the 7th floor of the bureau, inviting Chinese, Japanese, and foreign news media and radio stations in the city. The event was hosted by Director Lu of the Administrative Department, with Traffic Section Chief Chen Shantong and the directors of the administrative sections of each branch bureau serving as hosts. Present were Liang Xiuyu from the Municipal Propaganda Office (Secretary Pan Bibi on behalf) and dozens of reporters from Chinese, Japanese, and foreign newspapers. Director Lu Qi explained the essentials of traffic safety at the meeting. His original words are as follows: In today's Shanghai, traffic safety is indeed a current and important issue in police work, and a problem that urgently needs to be improved. According to the statistics of traffic accident records of this bureau, compared with last year and this year, in the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), the number of adults seriously injured due to traffic accidents was 1,504, and the number of children was 48. The number of deaths was 483 for adults and 17 for children. However, this year, as of September, the number of adults seriously injured due to traffic accidents has reached 1,111, and the number of children is 16. Based on these figures, it can be seen that the occurrence of traffic accidents has increased significantly. In today's Shanghai, its importance is even more obvious and urgent. Reorganizing urban traffic to ensure traffic safety and promote traffic welfare is the natural task of the traffic police. The effect depends on the activity of the traffic police and the general traffic reorganization facilities. However, the level of citizens varies, and they do not abide by traffic regulations and do not understand the meaning of the activities of the traffic police. No matter how hard the traffic police officers work and how dutiful they are, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. Any city that wants to achieve the goal of good traffic order must have a well-organized and properly managed traffic police organization, but the public's traffic knowledge and the cultivation of traffic ethics are even more critical issues. This spring, when I was ordered to go to the East to study police administration and stayed in Tokyo, I saw many traffic police officers on the roads, and the order of vehicles and pedestrians was orderly, and the public's traffic knowledge was popularized to the effect, which was very obvious. Looking back at this city, not to mention the villagers who have just arrived, but even the citizens who have lived here for a long time lack understanding of traffic regulations. In the end, in the city streets, vehicles and pedestrians are intertwined and chaotic, the order is chaotic, and the increase in traffic accidents is inevitable. In view of the current increase in traffic accidents and the seriousness of the traffic order problem, this bureau will hold another Traffic Safety Week from the 26th of this month, using various publicity methods. The purpose is to: 1. Popularize citizens' traffic safety ideas. 2. Make the public understand the meaning and function of the traffic police. 3. Cultivate the public's habit of respecting traffic discipline. 4. Promote traffic ethics. 5. Make citizens pay attention to the methods of avoiding traffic dangers. In short, we seek to make traffic knowledge universal and deeply rooted in every citizen, so that citizens can be guaranteed traffic safety. This bureau sincerely hopes that the holding of Traffic Safety Week can arouse the greatest attention and cooperation of all citizens, recognizing that traffic safety is their own life safety. Based on this goal, we firmly believe that the traffic order in this city can be significantly improved in the future, and the general damage will tend to decrease day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Minister Matsudaira Discusses the Increasingly Meddlesome Relationship Between Chongqing and the United States; Will Further Interfere in Chongqing's Internal Affairs <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held its regular press conference yesterday (23rd) at 2:30 PM at the Hua Chou Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road, as usual. Minister of Information Matsudaira of the Embassy and Vice Consul Fukuma, on the spot, Minister Matsudaira gave the following impressions on the recent deterioration of relations between Chongqing and the United States:</p>
<p>Recently, American public opinion toward Chongqing has gradually deteriorated, especially after a group of American journalists went to Yan'an for investigation in June of this year, and their report clearly stated the situation of the "war zone," pointing out that there were many shortcomings in the "war" power, which increased the most after the Hunan front incident, specifically criticizing Chongqing for poor politics and attacking it completely. At the same time, the criticism in the American newspapers is clear and explicit, and the situation is nothing more than that the American Fairy wants to make further interference in the internal affairs of the Chongqing regime, and it will definitely happen. It has been found that in the past, when the United States interfered in the internal affairs of other countries, it first used newspapers to criticize and denounce the politics of that country, which is a consistent means adopted by the United States, and the same means are also adopted for South America, especially for our East Asia, which is even more blatant, and they despise the countries of East Asia and believe that their culture is low. Now the American interference in Chongqing's opinions is to military, political, and culturalize the Chongqing regime. The main goal is to force Chongqing to remove the cadres of the Three People's Principles Youth League from the Chongqing political institutions. Recently, American Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss specifically made several demands to Chiang Kai-shek. According to the information obtained, it is deeply believed that after the enemy America's naval defeat in the eastern sea off Taiwan and the Pacific Ocean, it will inevitably make greater demands on Chongqing and interfere with Chongqing's ineffective operations in the Guilin area. From this point of view, it is clear that the United States wants to add the fate of Iran and Iraq to Chongqing, and add a new worry to the fate of the East Asian nations. Moreover, the United States is oppressing Chongqing to accept the conditions of the Communist Party, implement the cooperation between Chongqing and the Communist Party, and does not consider Chongqing's own intentions, which is really forcing others to do what is difficult.</p>

<p>The Municipal Goods Distribution Office of this city has distributed two municipal bushels of rice with the No. 23 comprehensive distribution certificate at the rice retailers or public sale places in the former First District since the 22nd of this month. The citizens in this area have suffered from the high prices of rice on the black market, and they have been very active in going to buy rice after hearing the news. However, it is reported that the household rice in this period is divided into three types: Indica rice, brown rice, or glutinous rice, but at present, the rice quality of most of the retailers is mostly very poor. Some of the rice sold in some stores contains ash, sand, bran, and grains. The citizens are extremely angry about this, and urgently hope that the relevant parties will earnestly find ways to improve and rescue them.</p>

<p>The Police Defense Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, having reviewed the amended Table No. 3 of the Shanghai Municipal Light Control Regulations, added tricycles and pedicabs to the category of ordinary vehicles. The Shanghai Land and Sea Air Defense Headquarters officially announced this in Notice No. 27 on October 14th of this year. Considering past circumstances, these ordinary vehicles have not been effectively controlled. Field police officers standing on roads or sidewalks often do not pay attention to or correct ordinary vehicles that do not have lights or lack control equipment. Therefore, each division chief has been ordered to instruct their officers to thoroughly implement the regulations and to inform vehicle owners to comply promptly to ensure full control.</p>

<p>The 24th press conference was held as usual at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 23rd) at the Municipal Government Conference Room on Jiangxi Road. Secretary Pan Bide of the Municipal Propaganda Office attended and presided on behalf of Director Liang, reporting on the written responses of the Merchants' Association to various questions raised by reporters from various news agencies in this city. The following is an excerpt of the questions and answers: Rice and Grain Issues: Question the Rice and Grain Control Committee</p>
<p>1.  Central News Agency asks: During wartime, all measures are primarily based on military needs, but nurturing the people is essential for warfare, as the people nurture the war effort. This is an immutable principle that the Chairman has proclaimed. What is the overall strategy for coordinating military rice and civilian rice? How can the supply of rice for military needs be ensured, and what guarantees are there for the allocation of rice to the people? 2. Central News Agency asks: What is the current state of rice collection in various regions? Are farmers truly benefiting from it, and are there any unscrupulous elements taking advantage of the situation to exploit and manipulate? 3. Central News Agency asks: What is the current price of rice in this city, how is the price standard determined, and has there been consultation with the Price Review Council? 4. Chinese Daily asks: The price of rice is the main factor in commodity prices. To suppress commodity prices, the price of rice must be suppressed first. Currently, the price of rice is skyrocketing, stimulating a uniform rise in other commodity prices. How does the Commodity Control Committee plan to deal with the rice price issue? 5. Chinese Daily asks: The amount of rice allocated per household in this city is too small, forcing citizens to seek it on the black market. However, due to restrictions on free imports, the supply of rice on the black market is limited, leading to unmet demand. In the past, suggestions have been made to either increase the allocation of rice per household or relax restrictions on rice imports. Could the Rice Control Committee consider adopting one of these suggestions or have other good ideas to alleviate the food shortage and address the livelihood issues? Answer: The above five questions all pertain to rice and grain issues and are quite important. We should send a letter to the Rice and Grain Control Committee to answer them, which will be more straightforward.</p>
<p>Reasons for Price Increase in Allocated Flour</p>
<p>6.  Ping Bao asks: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times. Please explain the reason. Answer: The allocated price of flour has increased by one and a half times because the cost of flour production is higher due to the newly set purchase price of wheat. All transportation and other costs have also increased, as have the prices of various commodities. Therefore, the previously set prices for flour and bran in various regions must be reassessed to balance income and expenditure. After repeated discussions with all relevant parties and careful consideration, it was deemed necessary to make adjustments. The Flour and Wheat Control Committee has already reported this directly to the Executive Yuan and has also informed the Commodity Control Committee.</p>
<p>Next Period's Allocation of Cotton Cloth per Household</p>
<p>7.  Central News Agency asks: Peddlers buying and selling cotton cloth allocation certificates are ubiquitous on the streets, disrupting the allocation policy. Has your committee noticed this, and what is your attitude towards it? Answer: Buying and selling are not allowed according to regulations and should be cracked down upon by administrative agencies. 11. Central News Agency asks: Cloth stalls in the Nanyang Bridge and Ningxia Road area were previously discussed for crackdown, and your committee also banned them once, but now the situation has worsened, and the business area has expanded. Although there are many reasons for this, what is your committee's determination to crack down on this? Answer: It should be cracked down upon by the city's administrative agencies according to regulations.</p>
<p>Commodity Control is Still in its Initial Stages</p>
<p>12. Chinese Daily asks: The city's commodity control work has been dealing with trivial matters and has failed to get on the right track. Is it because the organizational structure is not yet perfect, or is it due to personnel issues? Please explain. Answer: Commodity control is still a pioneering endeavor in the Republic of China. It can be said that there are no precedents and a lack of experienced people. In the process of implementation, trivial matters are bound to arise. Although the achievements of commodity control in friendly countries can be used as a reference, the national conditions are different, and there are some things that are not very suitable. Commodity control has been implemented for more than a year, and we are gradually making adjustments. In the future, it will gradually get on the right track. 13. Chinese Daily asks: Reporters from various news agencies often find that there is no one responsible for liaison when interviewing for news about the Commodity Control Committee, resulting in a lot of isolation from the outside world. At the same time, when inquiries are made, the answers are often irrelevant or unhelpful, making it a futile effort. We hope that methods can be found to improve this in the future. Answer: Our committee has always assigned a secretary in charge of compiling and issuing news and announcements. However, due to internal organizational changes in July of this year, the focus of all commodity control matters has been shifted to the various control committees under its jurisdiction. Sometimes, when reporters come to our committee to inquire about the current state of implementation of various commodity controls, it may not be possible to provide immediate answers. Furthermore, there are times when reporters are received by personnel who are not specifically responsible, which leads to inaccurate answers. This is inevitable. In the future, we will instruct our staff to pay attention to this at all times. 14. Chinese Daily asks: Since the beginning of the city's commodity control work, it has often failed to conduct thorough investigations of local conditions, leading to frequent changes in orders, which have instead stimulated price increases and affected people's livelihoods. What is the reason for this? Answer: Changes in control orders may be due to factual changes in circumstances. Not all control orders are subject to change. The term "frequent changes in orders" does not specify which orders are being referred to. Please provide specific examples for us to answer.</p>

<h3 id="e25">My Views on Applications for Cotton Product Removals <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Cui Wen</p>
<p>The Commodity Control Committee, in order to specialize tasks and improve administrative efficiency, transferred the work of applying for the removal of cotton products to the Cotton Control Committee for direct handling. If we look at it from the perspective of following established rules, with responsibility in the hands of specialists, its work efficiency should be no less than that of the previous Commodity Control Committee. However, the reality is the opposite, leading to much public criticism that the Cotton Control Committee is intentionally delaying the process. Although some criticisms may be exaggerated, the difficulty of applying for removals is not something that outsiders can fully understand. For example, if an application takes too long, even if the removal is approved, the validity of the permit becomes questionable. It is a difficult situation to navigate, requiring much thought. Therefore, the applicant's desire for "speed" is driven by the circumstances. I, despite my limited knowledge, will list several points based on my observations for the benefit of those with greater insights.</p>
<p>1.  Publicly Announce Restrictions: The Cotton Control Committee should publicly announce any cotton products that are not permitted for removal or are prohibited from export due to conflicting with the Cotton Control Committee's regulations. This will avoid repeated applications, wasted time, and hinder normal work progress. 2. Reduce Entries: The Committee should temporarily reject incomplete applications or applications with excessively low unit prices. It should point out the errors and accept them again after correction, to avoid discovering errors after acceptance, which will affect the variable time wasted. 3. Set Official Prices: To reduce entries, correct official prices should be set. Current commodity prices fluctuate constantly. For example, when goods shipped from North China arrive in Shanghai after obtaining a permit, much time has passed, rendering the approved unit price obsolete. The Committee may disapprove of excessively low unit prices, in the belief that high prices are correct. Applicants, to please the Cotton Control Committee, will then strive to inflate the permitted unit prices, leading to inflated applications and potentially stimulating price increases at any time. The best approach is for the Cotton Control Committee (or a public association familiar with cotton prices) to publish an accurate price for each period monthly, adjusting it according to market fluctuations, allowing applicants (regardless of the unit price or quantity of the permit) to increase or decrease the quantity of goods to be removed. 4. Submit Samples: For goods outside the published prices, or goods of unclear type even if priced beforehand, applicants should submit original samples for a proper price assessment, before being approved for removal. 5. Old Approvals Remain Valid: The Cotton Control Committee should uphold the validity of the removal approvals previously granted by the Commodity Control Committee, to avoid applicants unfamiliarity with the new procedures, leading to errors that affect the Cotton Control Committee's work progress.</p>

<p>Takao finally felt sympathy for his sister and asked a question. His sister didn't look at his face; she just shook her head. Her face looked pale. By one twenty in the afternoon, Takao had completely forgotten his fatigue and hunger. Because he knew that at this time, the coffins would depart from the Naval Ministry. Before long, security guards ran around to the various checkpoints to inspect and maintain order. When Takao felt the procession approaching, he stood on tiptoe to look. The officers leading the way appeared. The priests in white robes also appeared. As they quietly walked towards the front, it seemed like he could hear a mournful chirping sound. (Ah! That's the coffin!)</p>
<p>In an instant, Takao saw the white coffin carried on the black gun carriage. He didn't notice that the coffin, wrapped in white silk, was protected by eighteen officers. He immediately closed his eyes and lowered his head, only listening to the sound of the coffin passing by. (The ghost is walking... the ghost is...) The ghost sneered and looked at him from the gun carriage. As a result, Takao couldn't bear this illusion and began to cry loudly. This was like an acute infection; the rest of the crowd also began to sob. However, only his sister didn't cry. She sat demurely on the dirt platform, clasping her hands in prayer without moving. Although her biting lips trembled, there was no crying or tears. In the park, the navy band began to play "For the Country."</p>
<p>When Takao opened his eyes, the representatives of the bereaved families had already passed by, and the family's mourning procession was now walking in front of him. (Ah, that's the ghost's mother.) He saw the small, hunched-over great-grandmother in the black mourning procession. Next to her, very much like the ghost, was his fourth younger brother, dressed in national uniform, running along. (Oh my! Mr. Ogata is also there...) Perhaps he was participating as a representative of the teacher. He was wearing a full dress with a black armband, his slightly chubby upper body swaying. Takao deeply felt the atmosphere of his hometown, trying to suppress his emotion towards the ghost, and also trying to suppress his desire to greet them. After the mourning procession had completely passed, the crowd began to move. Takao continued to wait until the memorial service was over, still not wanting to leave suddenly. After a little while, his sister slowly stood up. Takao suddenly saw that his sister's kneecaps were bleeding from kneeling for too long. (154) [P The YWCA cordially welcomes visitors&gt;</p>
<p>The Shanghai Christian Young Women's Christian Association, in order to maintain various expenses for the next year, began a fundraising campaign on the 6th of this month with a goal of eight million yuan. In order to inform the outside world of the work situation, it is specifically scheduled to invite people from all walks of life to visit the nursery and children's home sponsored by the association from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 24th of this month. The nursery is still a pioneering undertaking in Shanghai, and the association's excellent management has won social support. People who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and interested in children's work are welcome to visit. Heavily in debt, and with the cold weather approaching, hundreds of children are in danger of freezing and starvation. It is earnestly hoped that charitable people from all over the world will generously donate, so that the institution can maintain its future without worry. Donations of any amount are welcome, and this office can also collect and transfer them.</p>

<p>Submitted to the French Tram Company</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, At nine o'clock this morning, I found a blue cloth parcel at the tram station at the 16th Pier, containing banknotes. I waited for a long time, but no one came to claim it, so I had to take it on Tram No. 70 and hand it over to Ticket Seller No. 429 to be forwarded to the French Tram Company for safekeeping, pending collection. Luo Chen respectfully, residing in the Dong residence at the Yingkang Lumber Company in Dongchang Road, Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Pork Industry Sellers' Dispute: Donation to Help the Home for the Aged <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>○ Goal: Five million yuan ○ Period: Until November 10th ○ Collection Point: Shanghai District Livestock Industry Pork Retailers' Association. Recently, due to a dispute in the trade among colleagues, a buyer delivered 20 fresh pigs to the association to be operated, and the resulting profits were donated to the Home for the Aged, which is commendable. The original letter is transcribed as follows: [Regarding a certain party selling at black market prices, a dispute arose between the two parties. Subsequently, Kui, He Azhang, Gu Tangsheng, Lu Xikui, and Qin Shunfu mediated, and the seller delivered 20 fresh pigs at market prices to our association for sale without commission, covering the cost, and donated all the profits to charity. Now, after all the sales, a profit of 27,300 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates has been calculated. The mediators have gathered 30,000 yuan and sent it to your office with a special letter, requesting that it be forwarded to the Home for the Aged for expenses. Although the amount is small, it does not compensate for the actual needs, but their sincerity is commendable. We hope that the facts will be published in the newspapers to encourage others to follow suit. We will be most grateful.]</p>
