<h3 id="c1">塞班島戰役的得失 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>這次敵美動員了十分之八的艦隊，以戰鬥艦十數艘，航空母艦二十餘艘為主幹的大型部隊，護送一百餘艘的運輸船，自從六月十一日開始，向為利亞納羣島襲擊。經過了一個多月的時間，才把長僅二十四公里，寬不滿八公里的塞班島佔領。從這裏可以看出敵美戰鬥力的低能。况且，敵美在這一個多月的時間內，不斷消耗，不斷增援，所付出的代價，更是得不償失。</p>
<p>從盟邦日木作戰經過以觀，始終採取以寡敵衆，盡量消耗敵方兵力的戰略。尤其自七月七日開始，駐守該島的軍隊奮舉全力作最後攻擊，歷時旬日，艱苦作戰。在島日僑，也始終協力軍隊參加戰鬥，全員殉職。從這裹可以看出日本寗為玉碎不為瓦全的戰鬥精神。</p>
<p>所以，塞班島之戰，表面上雖似敵美勝利，而日本失敗了。可是，實質上怎樣呢？在戰役中已經顯示了敵美戰鬥力的低能。同時，也顯示了盟邦日本玉碎的戰鬥精神。如果以這樣的戰鬥力與戰鬥精神為比衛，雙方在相等力量相等規模的戰鬥中，共勝負之數，實已不待著卜了。</p>
<p>更進一步，我們從塞班島戰役中，日本方面所引起的反響推論，實在值得注意。</p>
<p>第一，日本民族的特性，是外沉靜而內堅韌的，也是先沉靜而後堅韌的。在沉靜時期，它是埋頭苦幹，進至堅韌時期，它是　而不舍。大東亞戰爭的初期，日本是在沉靜的埋頭苦幹；現在己達決戰階段，日本是在堅韌的　而不舍。尤其是這次塞班島戰役，日本國內的決戰態勢，一定為之急速轉變。日本國民巳届人人抱必死決心之時。敵方愈在情勢上聚迫，日本國民心理愈是向敵　之途發展。所以，日本全國人民視塞班之役為「天佑」，就是加速敵愾心的發皇，使所有人力都向戰時增產之途推進。例如敵美早已使用全力於飛樣生產，男子自六十五歲以下，女子自五十歲以下，均往飛機廠工作。女工人數佔百分之四十。所有汽車工廠均改為飛機工廠，畫夜分三班開工，生產能率巳達最高峯。但日本的女工人數僅占百分之二十，工廠一日一班，今後如改日夜三班，則生產能率，可急速增加。這是促使日木國民敵愾心理發皇的最重要之點。</p>
<p>第二，從整個戰局而言，塞班島固為局部損失，但根木上並不發生影響，猶之樹木，枝葉失落，不足以動搖根榦。枝節的局部的犧牲，是一種有計劃的戰略。况且，日木陸海軍正在引誘敵方迫近內綫，同時，在大陸作戰方面順利成功，正竭力貯備戰力，以待決定性的戰機到臨。尤其是日木國民一致信賴陸海軍，全面協力，這在大東亞戰爭的勝利，更是最有力的保證。</p>
<p>第三，就敵方而言，塞班島戰役中之犧牲，敵美自承為開戰以來袋大之打擊，因此，敵美軍事首腦方面對這次戰役，雖已立足該烏，但心理上發生很大的動搖。一方面，今後敵美對於補給綫不但延長，且須繼續不絕，更是莫大的漏巵。共次，敵美政府主腦方面，則以此役引為功績，藉以奪取政權。羅斯福更將利為統選叫任總統之宣傳工具，而霸佔世界。財閥方面，亦將利用以對中國，印度，近東等地作經濟侵略而企圖獨佔</p>
<p>總之，大東亞戰爭已入決戰階段，敵人以死力　鬥，為意想中事。一地之得失，與整個戰局無決定影響。所以，我們對於塞班島得失之觀察，並不十分重視。而我們所應重視者，在於盟邦日木軍民，因此更激起敵愾心理，急速轉變國內決戰態勢。貯備戰力，以待戰機，予敵重殲。我們也是參戰國家，以整個大東亞戰爭的立塲而　，當然與盟邦取得一致行動，所以，我們朝野也將如何奮起，一致適應決戰熊勢，實為當前最須重視的課題。</p>
<h3 id="c2">臨曠古重大局面唯有前進之一途　日東條首相發表重要談話 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日首相東條氏，頃以「臨於緊急戰局」為題，發表談話，其全文如次：馬利亞納　島，自六月十一日以米，由於日軍將士之英勇奮戰，已予敵以重大打擊，然塞班島終落敵手，此實堪痛心，保衛神州之大任下，對我於南海殉國之忠勇將士及同胞之英靈，於茲深致　悼之忱。自拜奉宣戰大詔以來，迄茲二年有半，於其問，我皇軍將士，隨地展開英勇之戰，我一億同胞，亦能克服所有困難，向完遂大東亞戰爭之長途　進，然英美尤其敵美，亦逐漸增强其反攻之勢，敵更逐次突進以迄於馬利亞納羣島。於今帝國已逢曠古之重大局面，然唯有今日適為擊滅仇敵一決勝負之絕好時鐵，值此時機，為守護我皇國，唯有前進一途，心中無妄想，目下無生死，恃我幾多戰友及同胞之鮮血，恪守戰訓，傾舉全力，以期迅速滅敵，獲致最後勝利，如此始能報答為維護皇國從事大東亞戰爭之殉國勇士。大東亞戰爭之目的，于宣戰大詔中己昭然明示，大東亞戰爭于帝國言，為興廢分岐之戰，亞洲解放之戰，大東亞戰爭于敵方　，為奴化東亞之職，征服世界之戰，是故，更可謂其為自存自衛與達成野望之戰，解放與侵略之戰，夫今日己臨決戰之機，亦正為與東亞諸民族幷歐洲各盟邦共同相携，澈底摧毀敵人於不逞反攻之時，且眞實之戰爭蓋由是始，一億國民應新其決死之覺悟，凝集三千年之傳統鬥魂，以獲積極之勝利，恃此以安聖慮，以固鬥志。</p>
<h3 id="c3">塞班島日守備軍創敵後壯烈殉職　勇猛作戰眞髓發揮無遺 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　日大本營十八日下午五時發表：　塞班島日軍，自七月七日晨舉全力作最後攻擊，予敵以重創，一部日軍進至塔保喬山附近，勇戰力鬥，予敵甚大損害，至十六日止，全員卒告壯烈陣亡。該　陸軍部隊指揮官，為陸軍中將齋藤義次，海軍部隊指揮官，為海軍少將迂村武久，該方面海軍最高揮指官海軍中將南雲忠一，亦在該島陣亡，　班　日橋，始終協力軍方，凡能作戰者，均參加戰鬥，似亦與該島日軍將兵同其命運矣。</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　塞　島日軍守備隊，曾於七月七日對美軍發動最後之總攻擊，斯時由該地最高指揮官發布命令，決以死戰而後已之精神為國捐軀，其要旨　自敵美軍登陸以來，日諸部隊之勇猛，實將其眞　發　二無遺，守備部隊目定於土七日對敵美作最後之總攻　，　諸隊於是日晨。均各自突破當前之敵軍，向加郎卡諾亞突進，必須粉碎敵美陣綫。　決戰之先，於各隊分別選拔特別挺進隊，六日以後，隨時潛入敵軍陣地，担任破壞敵司令部，宿營地，砲兵陣地，戰車飛　等，使其混亂。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日陸海軍將士　一致待機敵松島部長發表談話 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>中央社電守備塞班島之日軍，予登陸之美軍以痛烈之打擊後，業已全體壯烈殉函，十八日已由日大本營發表，日駐華艦隊報道部長松島海軍大佐，特就此點發表談話，大要如次：　塞班島之日木軍部隊，自六月十一日以來，　擊大部隊之敵美軍，忍受各種之惡條件，抗拒敵軍之攻擊，奮戰力鬥，歷時一月有餘，其間所予敵軍損害之重大，已由敵方數次發表，灼然可見，尤其美海軍次長巴待　曾於十六旦大聲疾呼，美軍人力危機，更可知其憤勢之戰重，，其實守備塞班島之日本軍，乃係充分完成所謂擊滅减弱敵兵力之戰略上目的後而壯烈殉國。日本軍在塞班島雖喪失如南雲中將之身經百職名將，然日本軍守備部隊之奮戰猛鬥，直戰至　後一兵之忠勇義　，實為傳統精神之發露，若在僅恃物質力量之英美軍方面，決難臻此。日本陸海軍將土，為報復在塞班島陣亡之戰友　仇起見，現已一致加强決意待機殺敵。</p>
<p>塞班島之失陷，因予敵方以戰略上的利益，敵最近將有以此島為據點，而在中部太平洋　動之可能性，然日本平時對於敵方之此種企圖，早已料及，嚴加警戒，故敵方決難輕易完成其目的，自可斷言。其毋寗日軍反可靜待敵方兵力之接近本土，而一舉加以擊滅，蓋日電以逸持勞，可選取最有利之地點與時期，而獲得最後之勝利也。</p>
<p>兵術之要歸恰如水之並無常形，得以伸屈自如，關於兵之運用，決不可固執一個條件，目前日本軍雖已捨棄太平洋上之一小島，然主力部除仍分散於大東亞之各地，培義戰力，以備最後之決戰，今後敵軍不論出現於何處，日軍決將予以較塞　島尤為　切之打擊。</p>
<p>大東亞各民族切勿為敵方表面上之成功而誘感，在決定大東亞興亡之最後關頭，希望靜待日本民族之發揮偉大底在力，大東亞之解放，唯有日本獲得勝利後始可確保。能否使東亞脫歸英美之殖民地地位，實繫於日本陸海軍之實力，希望各位加以明確之理解，而為獲得大東亞共同之勝利而邁進協力為要。</p>

<p>日本大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，十八日於會見記者團時，九「華萊士訪渝後之重慶近情，」發表談話，大要如次：「華萊士似已于十日前歸抵華府，然彼于七月二日臨去重慶時會構：渝方戰爭意識，雖屬旺盛，然因遭遇種種經濟困難，致軍事上亦不得不</p>
<p>恨于失敗</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Gains and Losses of the Battle of Saipan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>This time, the enemy, the Americans, mobilized eight-tenths of their fleet, mainly a large force composed of more than ten battleships and over twenty aircraft carriers, escorting more than a hundred transport ships. Starting from June 11th, they attacked the Mariana Islands. After more than a month, they finally occupied Saipan Island, which is only 24 kilometers long and less than eight kilometers wide. From this, one can see the incompetence of the enemy American combat power. Moreover, the enemy Americans have been constantly consuming and reinforcing their forces over this month, and the price they paid is not worth the gain.</p>
<p>Judging from the combat operations of the Allied Japan, they have always adopted a strategy of fighting the few against the many, trying to consume the enemy's forces as much as possible. Especially since July 7th, the troops stationed on the island have made a final all-out attack, lasting ten days of arduous combat. The Japanese residents on the island also cooperated with the army to participate in the battle, and all of them died in their posts. From this, one can see the Japanese spirit of preferring to be shattered jade rather than intact tile.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Battle of Saipan, on the surface, seems to be a victory for the enemy Americans and a defeat for Japan. But what is the reality? The incompetence of the enemy American combat power has already been demonstrated in the battle. At the same time, it also demonstrated the Allied Japan's spirit of being shattered jade. If we compare the two sides in battles of equal strength and scale, based on this combat power and fighting spirit, the outcome is already obvious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should pay attention to the repercussions caused by the Battle of Saipan from the Japanese perspective.</p>
<p>First, the characteristic of the Japanese nation is that it is outwardly calm but inwardly tenacious, and also first calm and then tenacious. During the calm period, it buries itself in hard work; when it enters the tenacious period, it perseveres tirelessly. In the early stages of the Greater East Asia War, Japan was calmly burying itself in hard work; now that it has reached the decisive battle stage, Japan is tenaciously persevering tirelessly. Especially in this Battle of Saipan, the decisive battle posture in Japan will definitely change rapidly because of it. The Japanese people have now reached a point where everyone is determined to die. The more the enemy pressures in terms of the situation, the more the Japanese national mentality develops in the direction of resisting the enemy. Therefore, the Japanese people throughout the country regard the Battle of Saipan as "Heaven's blessing," which is to accelerate the development of enemy hatred and promote all manpower to the path of wartime production. For example, the enemy Americans have long used all their strength in aircraft production. Men under the age of 65 and women under the age of 50 all work in aircraft factories. Female workers account for 40% of the total. All automobile factories have been converted into aircraft factories, operating in three shifts day and night, and production efficiency has reached its peak. However, female workers in Japan account for only 20% of the total, and factories operate only one shift a day. If they switch to three shifts day and night in the future, production efficiency can be rapidly increased. This is the most important point to promote the development of the Japanese people's enemy-hating mentality.</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of the overall war situation, Saipan Island is indeed a partial loss, but it does not fundamentally affect the situation, just like a tree whose branches and leaves fall, which is not enough to shake its roots. The partial sacrifice of branches and leaves is a planned strategy. Moreover, the Japanese army and navy are luring the enemy closer to the inner line. At the same time, they are successfully operating on the mainland, and are doing their best to accumulate combat power to await the arrival of a decisive battle opportunity. In particular, the Japanese people unanimously trust the army and navy and fully cooperate, which is the most powerful guarantee for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Third, as for the enemy, the sacrifices in the Battle of Saipan are admitted by the enemy Americans as the greatest blow since the start of the war. Therefore, the enemy American military leaders have been greatly shaken psychologically by this battle, even though they have established a foothold on the island. On the one hand, the enemy American supply line will not only be extended in the future, but must also continue uninterrupted, which is an enormous drain. Secondly, the enemy American government leaders will use this battle as a credit to seize power. Roosevelt will even use it as a propaganda tool to be elected president and dominate the world. The financial groups will also use it to carry out economic aggression against China, India, the Near East and other places, and attempt to monopolize them.</p>
<p>In short, the Greater East Asia War has entered the decisive battle stage, and the enemy is fighting desperately, which is to be expected. The gain or loss of one place has no decisive impact on the overall war situation. Therefore, we do not attach much importance to our observation of the gains and losses of Saipan Island. What we should value is that the Allied Japanese military and civilians are even more aroused by the enemy-hating mentality, and are rapidly changing the domestic decisive battle posture, accumulating combat power to await the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy. We are also a participating country, and from the standpoint of the entire Greater East Asia War, we must take consistent action with our allies. Therefore, how our government and people will rise up together to adapt to the decisive battle situation is the most important issue at present.</p>

However, Saipan Island has finally fallen into enemy hands, which is truly regrettable. Under the great task of protecting the divine land, I hereby express my deepest condolences to the loyal and brave soldiers and compatriots who died for their country in the South Seas. Since the issuance of the declaration of war, two and a half years have passed. During this time, our imperial soldiers have launched heroic battles everywhere, and our 100 million compatriots have also been able to overcome all difficulties and advance towards the long journey of completing the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain and the United States, especially the enemy Americans, have also gradually increased their counter-offensive forces, and the enemy has gradually advanced to the Mariana Islands. Today, the Empire is facing an unprecedentedly critical situation. However, today is precisely the best time to defeat the enemy and determine the outcome. At this time, in order to protect our imperial country, there is only one way forward. With no delusions in our minds and no thoughts of life or death, relying on the fresh blood of our many comrades-in-arms and compatriots, we must恪守战训、傾挙全力恪守战训, and strive to quickly destroy the enemy and achieve final victory. Only in this way can we repay the brave soldiers who died for the Greater East Asia War to protect the imperial country. The purpose of the Greater East Asia War has been clearly stated in the declaration of war. For the Empire, the Greater East Asia War is a war of rise and fall, a war of liberation for Asia. For the enemy, the Greater East Asia War is a war to enslave East Asia and conquer the world. Therefore, it can be said to be a war of self-preservation and self-defense versus a war to achieve wild ambitions, a war of liberation versus a war of aggression. Today, we have reached the decisive battle, and it is also the time for us to join hands with the various ethnic groups of East Asia and the Allied countries in Europe to thoroughly destroy the enemy's reckless counter-offensive. And the real war is just beginning. One hundred million citizens should renew their determination to die, and gather the traditional fighting spirit of three thousand years to achieve active victory, and rely on this to reassure the Emperor and strengthen our fighting spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Japanese Garrison on Saipan Island Heroically Sacrificed Themselves Behind Enemy Lines, Displaying the True Essence of Courageous Combat <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 18th that the Japanese army on Saipan Island launched a final all-out attack on the morning of July 7th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. A part of the Japanese army advanced to the vicinity of Mount Tapochau, fighting bravely and fiercely, causing great losses to the enemy. By the 16th, all members had gloriously died in battle. The commander of the army unit was Lieutenant General Yoshitsugu Saito, and the commander of the naval unit was Rear Admiral Takehisa Uemura. The highest naval commander in that area, Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo, also died in battle on the island. The Japanese residents on Saipan Island always cooperated with the military. All those who could fight participated in the battle, and seemed to share the same fate as the Japanese soldiers on the island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Saipan Island launched a final general attack on the American army on July 7th. At that time, the highest commander of the area issued an order to sacrifice themselves for the country with the spirit of fighting to the death. The main point is that since the enemy American army landed, the bravery of the Japanese troops has truly been fully displayed. The garrison decided to launch a final general attack on the enemy Americans on July 7th. On the morning of that day, all the troops broke through the enemy forces in front of them and advanced towards Garapan Kanoa, determined to crush the enemy American lines. Before the decisive battle, special commando teams were selected separately from each unit. After the 6th, they infiltrated the enemy's positions at any time to destroy the enemy's headquarters, camps, artillery positions, tanks, aircraft, etc., to create chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Army and Navy Soldiers Unite and Await the Opportunity - Statement by Director Matsushima <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) After inflicting a severe blow on the landing American forces, the Japanese army defending Saipan Island has gloriously sacrificed itself. This was announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 18th. Naval Captain Matsushima, Director of the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China, made a statement on this matter, the main points of which are as follows: Since June 11th, the Japanese military units on Saipan Island have been fighting a large force of enemy Americans, enduring all kinds of harsh conditions, resisting enemy attacks, and fighting bravely for more than a month. The significant damage they inflicted on the enemy has been repeatedly announced by the enemy side, which is clearly visible. In particular, the Undersecretary of the US Navy, Forrestal, cried out loudly on the 16th about the US military's manpower crisis, which shows the fierceness of the battle. In fact, the Japanese army defending Saipan Island had fully accomplished the strategic objective of destroying and weakening the enemy's forces before gloriously sacrificing themselves. Although the Japanese army lost a famous general like Vice Admiral Nagumo on Saipan Island, the brave and fierce fighting of the Japanese garrison, fighting to the last soldier, was a manifestation of the traditional spirit. This would be difficult to achieve for the British and American armies, which rely solely on material strength. The Japanese army and navy soldiers have strengthened their determination to wait for the opportunity to kill the enemy in order to avenge the comrades who died in battle on Saipan Island.</p>
<p>The loss of Saipan Island has given the enemy a strategic advantage. The enemy may recently use this island as a base to operate in the central Pacific. However, the Japanese had long anticipated this attempt by the enemy and have been closely watching them. Therefore, it can be asserted that it will be difficult for the enemy to easily achieve their goal. On the contrary, the Japanese army can wait for the enemy's forces to approach the mainland and destroy them in one fell swoop. The Japanese can wait at their leisure, choose the most favorable location and timing, and achieve final victory.</p>
<p>The essence of military tactics is like water, which has no constant form and can be stretched and bent freely. In the use of troops, one must not adhere to a single condition. Although the Japanese army has abandoned a small island in the Pacific, the main force is still dispersed throughout the Greater East Asia region, cultivating its combat power to prepare for the final decisive battle. No matter where the enemy appears in the future, the Japanese army will inflict a more severe blow than on Saipan Island.</p>
<p>The various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia must not be tempted by the enemy's superficial success. At this final juncture that determines the rise and fall of Greater East Asia, I hope you will quietly await the great potential of the Japanese nation. The liberation of Greater East Asia can only be guaranteed after Japan achieves victory. Whether or not East Asia can escape the colonial status of Britain and the United States depends on the strength of the Japanese army and navy. I hope you will clearly understand this and move forward in cooperation to achieve the common victory of Greater East Asia.</p>

<p>Reuter's dispatch from Seoul, 18th (Central News Agency) The focus of the Eastern Front operations is still in the central region, where Soviet forces seem to have begun crossing the Neman River between Kaunas (also known as Kaunas) and Grodno. According to front-line sources, a part of the 3rd Belorussian Front has reached a point two kilometers from the so-called "Suwalki Triangle" contained within East Prussia. The pressure on Kaunas, the capital of Lithuania, is also increasing moment by moment from the southeast and south. Soviet forces are currently attempting to rapidly expand the bridgehead west of the Neman River, and the threat to Kaunas from that direction cannot be ignored. According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, German forces are using new tank divisions to defend Kaunas with all their might against the above-mentioned Soviet movements. The battle for the defense of East Prussia, centered around Bartoszyce, seems to be approaching its final stage. Although it is not currently known where on the front line the German forces will stop the central offensive of the Soviet forces, judging from the current situation, the time when the Soviet forces will launch a general offensive against East Prussia is approaching. At the same time, there is news that the German forces have dispatched strategic reserve forces. It is likely that the German forces will launch a counter-offensive when they observe that the Soviet offensive has reached a certain limit.</p>

The development of the current war situation is extremely rapid, and its handling is extremely urgent. As far as the Navy is concerned, we will use more thorough training to prepare the Navy to respond to the war situation and carry out the war with this determination. All citizens should also be united and assist the Navy with this determination.

<p>Following the announcement of this year's unified procurement, allocation, manufacturing, and processing methods for flour and wheat by the Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Commerce Control Council, the wheat procurement work needs to be launched swiftly. According to the regulations, designated agents have been selected and regions have been demarcated to separately designate procurement work. Currently, to raise funds for procurement, the committee is negotiating a loan of 200 million yuan with various Chinese and Japanese banks in the city. The Japanese side includes six banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Teikoku Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Taiwan Bank, and Chosen Bank. The Chinese side includes twenty banks such as Bank of China, Bank of Communications, China Hsing Yeh Bank, Chekiang Industrial Bank, Chekiang Real Estate Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Continental Bank, and Chin Cheng Banking Corporation, jointly forming a wheat loan syndicate. The Bank of China will serve as the representative of the syndicate, and the loan will be provided in the form of acceptance bills, which will be discounted by the Central Bank of China.

<h3 id="e15">Minister Matsudaira Discusses Recent Situation in Chongqing - High Prices, Confused Ideologies <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Matsudaira, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, made the following remarks when meeting with a group of reporters on the 18th, regarding "the recent situation in Chongqing after Wallace's visit": "It seems that Wallace returned to Washington about ten days ago. However, when he left Chongqing on July 2nd, he believed that although Chongqing's awareness of the war was strong, they were facing various economic difficulties, which inevitably led to military failures.</p>
<p>Heard of Failure."</p>
<p>It is also said that during his stay in Chongqing, he encouraged the Chongqing Communists to compromise or advised them to improve agriculture. However, there has been no new progress since then. Prices in Chongqing are still soaring. On July 5th, Zhang Pingqun stated at a meeting with reporters that general prices were, on average, 438 times higher than before the war. Recent news from the mainland indicates that since the failure of the Hunan campaign, the price of rice has soared to 18,080 yuan per stone. From this, it can be inferred that general prices have actually increased to 800 times, which is twice as high as when Wallace was in Chongqing. Furthermore, the CCP's attitude towards Chongqing is extremely tough, demanding the transformation of the Chongqing regime and allowing representatives from Yan'an to participate. On July 7th, they also issued slogans demanding that Chongqing lift the encirclement of the CCP's army and provide military expenses for the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. From this, it can be seen that the CCP's position remains consistent, still demanding concessions from Chongqing.</p>
<p>Talk of Government</p>
<p>Reorganization is Rampant. There are many who covet the position of the President of the Executive Yuan, and there are also rumors of changes in the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. On the one hand, when Chongqing intellectuals meet Wallace, they always mention agriculture, believing that Wallace wants Chongqing to pay attention to agriculture so that Chongqing will permanently become a market for American goods. Furthermore, they strongly express their dissatisfaction with Wallace's interference in Chongqing's internal affairs and diplomacy, disregarding Chongqing's will, and denying its independence and autonomy. In short, Wallace, during his visit to Chongqing, ignored the reality, acted as he pleased, and spoke arbitrarily, stirring up trouble out of thin air and causing ideological confusion. As a result, the issue of government reorganization cannot be ignored. Regarding the relationship between Soong Tzu-wen and Kung Hsiang-hsi, Soong Mei-ling flew to South America a few days ago. Although she ostensibly claimed it was to recuperate from illness, her true purpose may have been to discuss these issues with the Soong family and their allies."</p>

<p>After the Huaihai area was changed to a provincial system, the Central Reserve Bank notes have been generally circulated, and its economic institutions are gradually being established. The Executive Yuan believes that it should be subject to the same general economic control regulations as the three provinces and two municipalities. Previously, relevant agencies were instructed to promptly draft amendments to general economic controls and other regulations that needed to be revised and submit them for review. According to reports, the Price Control Review Committee has submitted its response, stating that the principle of allowing the Huaihai provincial area to adopt the control regulations of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui should be adopted. If the actual situation is not suitable, separate regulations can be formulated. The Ministry of Industry has also submitted a report to the Executive Yuan on the previous situation. It is reported that the Executive Yuan has approved the proposal and, in addition to reporting it to the National Government for record and separately instructing and notifying relevant agencies, has also instructed the Commerce Control Council to take note. The Commerce Control Council has already sent a letter to the joint association of Chinese and Japanese merchants in Shanghai to take note.</p>
