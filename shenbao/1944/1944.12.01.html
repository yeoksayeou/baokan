<p>東京三十日中央社電　日大本營三十日下午二時半發表。（一）日機特別攻擊隊靖國飛行隊六架，十一月二十九日猛攻雷伊泰灣內敵艦船，其中二架擊沉敵戰艦一艘，又三架各擊沉大型運輸船一艘，此外，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘被擊毀且起火，是後，日軍掩護戰鬥機二架尚未歸還。（二）參加此次攻擊之靖國飛行隊員如次：陸軍少尉大坪明，秦音次郎，陸軍下士石井一十四，松井秀雄，寺島忠正，河島鐵藏。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地三十日中央社電　日神風特別攻擊隊，曾於二十七日猛炸增援雷伊泰島之敵海上部隊。</p>
<p>東京二十九日中央社電　日還將新銳機一式陸上攻擊隊，自開戰以來屢建殊勳。按一式陸上攻擊隊機，係俱有優秀性能之雙發中性攻擊機，機型頗似烟卷之捲葉，但於前綫愛呼之謂一式　　攻擊機，即可發揮轟炸之效能，又能從事雷擊工作，故開戰以來，縱橫空際，建樹殊勳，此　攻擊　班，亦會參加作戰，致令敵人心胆酣慄。</p>
<p>富永中將發表決意</p>
<p>菲島基地三十日中央社電　菲律賓日空軍指揮官富永中將，二十九日會見記者團時，發表決意如次：空戰決　於本戰塲並不能在有第二次，此次我軍將兵亘數次組成特別攻擊隊，以一機對一艦之戰法，對　　　，此種壯烈無比之精神，自然將使菲律賓戰局日益深刻化，但吾以此拼　精神之前，必能　　　恃物量之敵。如每一兵士有此無畏精神，則可置槍械不用，僅輕裝懷抱炸彈，即可向敵之　車及砲兵陣地衝鋒，此在雷伊泰戰綫中已履見不鮮，我軍只能保有食糧及彈藥，余確借此戰爭必勝無疑。</p>
<h3 id="c2">雷島日敢死隊　突擊敵側背　美軍補給路已被切斷 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日軍於雷伊泰島塔加米西方高地樓築堅固陣地後，即邀擊來襲之敵，並屢屢深入敵陣，予以痛擊，曾冒暴雨衝入敵陣，施以猛攻，已獲莫大戰果，愛由某某少尉所率八名敢死隊，於十七日冒雨携輕機槍二架，深入森林，攀登岩石，繞至敵軍側背，是時敵軍以雨勢浩大，推料日軍斷難來襲，遂集於帳幕中雜談，日軍遂依然前進，並令機槍手二名據守要點，其他六名則於某少尉率領施行前進，須臾少尉發令後，該六名勇士即猛然前進，迫近敵軍帳幕，斯時敵軍以日軍突然攻擊，未加防備，遂陷混亂狀態，嗣於發見退路後，即爭先恐後逃脫，此時待機中之二名機槍手，遂對之猛加掃射，敵棄屍五六十具，而日軍八名則決未負傷，且得安然返防。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地三十日中央社電　雷伊泰島卡里加拉灣沿岸美軍，目路上補給路　日軍切斷後，因日軍長期猛攻，已受重創，唯仍繼續抵抗中，尤其馬那嘎那斯方面美軍，更一籌莫展，前曾以一部試向里蒙周圍進攻，但旋被日軍擊退，向西北深山中逃遁，日軍於二十日切斷卡里加拉至此那莫伯安問道路後，更向美軍陣地突入，獲得極大戰果，並繼續向馬那嘎那斯南側美軍左翼進攻中。又日軍自東方前進，會更向山中展開追擊作戰，布羅者塔加米方面戰綫，並無何大變化，該方面日軍掩身隊曾突入哈羅轉展椰子林中，炸毀敵榴彈砲二門，然後歸還。雷伊泰西岸山嶺方面，日軍二十五日上午於砲兵援護下，曾突入汪加克附近之答姆縣，而將該地佔領。又自南方加針達特向東方進攻中之日軍，已突入市坦河附近敵軍陣地，使陷入大混亂，現日軍仍繼續猛攻中。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地三十三日中央社電　日航空部隊曾於二十七日下午八時半左右，轟炸塔克羅班敵機塲及該市街之物資貯藏所，使其設施四處以上被毀起火。</p>
<p>日軍兩路施行奇襲</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地二十九日中央社電　雷伊泰北部日守軍，仍在蓋前猛攻卡保康，卡拉香之敵軍，而於二十七日曉開入該兩地間之公路與馬那嘎那斯見之公路，敵完全被遮斷，因此，馬那嘎那斯方面及里　方面之敵軍，今後僅能籍浦路以與後方連絡。雷伊泰中部，日新銳部隊開抵卡里達特後，刻在巴帕港著陸對敵壓迫中，至二十七日仍將退往卡里達特北方高地址敵擊潰，而進抵卡里達特市郊，刻仍對敵第七師團第三聯隊第二大隊繼續攻擊中。敵因日軍之攻擊，撤往第姆拉安後，即背海稱藝陣地，以防日軍攻擊，並備有十英寸榴彈砲十四門，惟日軍於二十七日夜，以新銳部隊該敵施行奮襲，並突襲其左右兩翼，而告成功，刻對該方面之敵主力仍繼續攻擊中。</p>
<p>雷伊泰　作戰特色　日軍參謀談話</p>
<p>日軍某基地參謀頃自雷伊泰島前綫歸來，就該島戰況並日軍奮戰情形談稱：雷伊泰作戰特色，第一，美軍補給路過長，且美軍必須與此長補給之前端從事戰　，兼職此前端可恃之機塲尚未能完全使用，故敵軍苦惱實深，然敵軍　以物量補救弱點。反之，日軍於自己勢力範圍圈內作戰，後方有空軍基地。第二，敵恃優勢之機動部隊，圖壓倒日空軍於雷伊泰島登陸，但屢收大挫，故其登陸作戰未能如期實行。第三，此次作戰於新幾內亞，塞班等地戰事不同，蓋日軍得自正面出動龐大之戰力在種種之特異性下努力奮戰，更才去肉搏突襲戰法，如培里琉島日軍突襲隊之衝功，實前所罕見。同時，日機亦活躍異常，海軍亦呼應出動，且雷伊泰島突襲隊之志願者，刻較前更多矣。</p>

<p>里斯本三十日中央社電　宋美齡今夏曾由渝赴南美，並曾訪問美國，九月初旬於紐約養病，關於此事每日郵報加爾各答訊稱：宋美齡渡美非僅養病，緣蔣介石已與宋美齡入於別居生活，宋美齡乃預訂暫居美國，恐係長期滯留其間，故將作有關中國衝動之講演云。但據渝中央社華盛頓訊則謂，駐美中之渝前財政部長孔祥熙否認此事，謂宋美齡擬於佛羅里達州邁阿密海岸久居，宋美齡欲歸渝之消息，純係虛稱。</p>

<p>申報讀者助學金成績展覽會今日起假座八仙橋青年會舉行，同時我們更發起第八屆申報讀者助學特別勸募隊，簡章見今日本報第三版。</p>
<p>我們以滿腔熱忱，希望讀者幫助我們—不，幫助全社會，全中國—的助學工作。這幾年來救助青年失學運動已經成爲一般社會人士「互通」的心念，已經成爲一般社會人士「互助」的工作，助學運動的成績，也至少可以說是許多「互通」「互助」運動中最偉大的一件。就是以本報來說，助學金額，第一屆三三，七三·六〇元，第二屆五一，五八七，五〇元，第三屆一四七，五三一·五〇元，第四屆二三六，四三一·〇〇元，第五屆一，三八二，五四七·〇〇元，第六屆三，二五六，三一六·〇〇元，第七屆一四，一九三，一六〇·〇〇元。助學學生數第一屆一，〇〇五人，第二屆九八四人，第三屆一，一五六人，第四屆一，六二九人，第五屆四，〇一三人，第六屆四，六二一人，第七屆四，六五八人。無論從金額上說，或從學生數上說，每一屆的成績總超越上一屆數倍。這個，一方面表示社會上需要救助怎樣的殷切，一方面表示申報讀者威靈這件事怎樣的努力。</p>
<p>助學的需要既然這樣的殷切，學費的增加又是無可如何的事實，所以，在每個學期將要終了，下一屆助學運動即將開始之前，我們一而看到受助學生的成績，一而又接到繼續扶助的請求，大家總是一喜一驚，讀者諸君和我們所引以爲喜的，就是受助學生的成績，個個都達到大家的希望，有許多更超出一般的理想，使大家感到這些捐款，這些工作，竟可創造這樣偉大的結果。同時使讀者諸君和我們所引以爲驚的，就是在困苦的環境下面，需要的人這樣衆多，需要的款，這樣鉅大，大家應當怎樣的繼續努力。可是，以過去七屆努力的結果來說，大家所認爲可驚的，最後還是轉爲可喜。捐款的數字，不但使已經得助的學子得以繼續求學，並且更可擴充到新的清寒優秀的學子們。申報讀者們在這樣艱苦困難的環境中所表現的互助精神，不僅是本報的光榮，更可以在新上海歷史上新中國歷史上佔着最光榮的一頁。</p>
<p>現在民國三十四年春季學期又將開始了。可喜的成績一部份已陳列在展覽會中，道是本報讀者們所認爲可以向全上海全中國人士所恭喜的一件事。同時，可驚的事實也又立刻擺在面前了。依照現在受助學生的人數，現有捐款的金額，推想下學期學費證件的趨勢，真開學的時期不過二個月，時間是這樣的短，現在需求扶助的優秀學子是這樣的多，需要的捐款又是這樣的大，這真是最急，最苦，最難的一件事。可是，憑着過去始終如一的信心，憑着全上海人士滿腔的熱忱，可使全上海人士的心靈互通，可使大家同心協力去做這一件互助的工作，我們深信這一件救急救苦救難的工作，必能有出人意料之外的收穫。</p>
<p>一千隊二千萬元不過是一個最低限度，連同現有的捐款僅僅足以維持現有的助學生繼續求學，因爲這許多學生，都是讀者諸君們數年來親手把血汗來栽培灌溉的花，無論如何困難，我們決不可令其萎縮枯槁，使大家前功盡棄。本報社和本報同人，自慚棉薄，先各捐助十萬元組織兩隊，不敢說是提倡，謹敢表示微意。我們深信助學運動已是大家共同的工作，教育下一代又是建國大道唯一的最切實的事情，大家在這個緊急關頭，必定能夠用大衆的力量，促成這件共同的工作，完遂這個共同的宏願。</p>
<p>敬求讀者，多多捐助。</p>

<p>笑與淚之間的重慶  陳彬龢　　本市新聞聯合會等五團體，聯合舉行之掃蕩敵英美預祝會，本人被邀演講，爰將講詞刋載於次；　　「山水甲天下」的桂林，自從大東亞戰爭展開後，他成爲進擾和平區與日本本土的航空基地羣的中心堡壘，又是英美渝夢想反攻的軍事戰略要地，同時，還是重慶的警戒哨兵。這樣重要的軍事據點，認控制着，認就在地理上先佔優勢，而處於主動地位。俗語有「棋高一着縛手縛脚「，也就是戰術上所常運用的「先發制人」。如果不能制人於前，先取得桂林，則大東亞戰爭在中國大陸上將受到嚴重的威脅。假如佔領衡陽，而不取得桂林，祇能認戰術上的勝利，沒有完成戰略的任務，因此，我們可以明白，今年四月中旬的中原大戰，以至湖南之戰，其主要作用，爲了準備攻佔桂林，達到戰略上的要求，在渝方的要求，其戰略上是保衛是爭奪這些戰略據點，所以在隴海綫西段，派遣渝軍中最精銳的湯恩伯胡宗南軍來保衛洛陽，在湖南戰役中，拚命死守衡陽，孤守困鬥至四十日，開中日事變來未有的先例，爲什麼？無非是爲保衛碩果僅存的戰略要地—桂林。桂林在整個大東亞戰爭範圍內有重要的戰略性，同時還具有重要的政略性。現在桂林被盟邦日軍攻佔已三周了，這次戰鬥經過，已有系統詳盡報導，我們對全盤戰局淸楚的認識。日軍還繼續向前追擊，又佔領桂黔邊境的宜山·河池·二十四日晨已抵達貴州省邊境的黎明關，今後局勢的發展，以及桂林佔領，對於重慶的影響，今天我們來作全面的分析。　　桂林在戰略上的重要性，前面已說過。這裏我們從各面來說明重慶在桂林的軍事部署，以及保衛經過和在政治上所引起的矛盾。軍事上的部署，在空軍方而，自從本年春季，渝空軍企圖轟炸日本本土，將其作戰據點由昆明遷往桂林，於桂林的南方，東南和西南三方面建築三飛機場，以理想的地形來配合敵美優勢的科學物質，作盡善盡安的飛行設備。同時，還有較近的後方基地—貴陽，重慶，成都，昆明，作後援，因此自誇爲不沈的陸上航空母艦，但是在保衛桂林的實際戰鬬中，渝美空軍並不能在空中佔居優勢，取得制空權，最後，還是費去巨大數量的炸藥炸毀了機場和設備逃回昆明去。渝美空軍的力量，我們不難得到正確的認織。英美犧牲渝方人力物力的心跡，於此得一證明。其次，在陸軍方面，從事於防衛桂林的渝軍，約有三十餘師，守衛桂林的軍隊共約三萬名，編成大軍，配以重砲和山砲，駐紮昆明之第五集團軍所屬戰隊之一部，調造至廣西戰棧，第五團軍所屬之機械化部隊，未開赴雲南前，就是在廣西全縣訓練的，對於廣西的地形，尤其是桂林附近，他們是最熟悉的。這次應是他們施展的時候，然而，來也快，去也速，一無所用。直接指揮死守桂林軍隊的是第十六集團軍副軍長韋雲淞，韋雲淞是廣西的重要幹部，他一直留在廣西，沒有隨李宗仁去第五戰區，這次由他來指揮桂林守軍，那麽，這些死守軍中，相信桂系軍隊居多數。桂林是重慶的牙城，同時，是廣西的中心城市，理應由渝軍中的精銳來死守，現在把守桂林的責任放在廣西人身上，這是不可思議的布置。以桂軍過去光榮的歷史，和强烈的廣西民族性，再以廣西的政治基礎，向比全國各省健全，而民團組織，其在中日事變中的表現，已爲全國所贊佩。理想中的桂林戰爭，堅決豫烈，艱苦犧牲，必遠過衡陽之役，因爲不僅前述數點，在最高指揮方面，都是中國傑出的人才，如白崇禧，向以中國戰略家見稱於時，第四戰區司令畏官張發奎，以驍勇著名於中國將領中，再有西南行營桂林辦公廳主任李濟琛，亦爲中國名將。這三位將領中，不祇是才識著於時，且在歷史上和地方關係上都有特殊關係，並無牽制相尅的矛盾。得任何戰役中未有之地利和人和，並不能阻止日軍的進攻，除了在軍事上使我們認識重慶拖戰，已到了强弩之末的程度，政治上也失去基礎，桂林的佔領，是最有力的證明。　　由於桂林被日軍佔領，對重慶所發生的影響，非常嚴重。中國產米的主要區城，是太湖，鄱陽湖和洞庭湖三處，而重慶所依賴的食糧來源是洞庭湖區域，桂林一失，主要的食糧路被遮斷，民食方而，先受到嚴重打擊，而將成政治不穩的因素，其次，軍需資源，湖南之銅，鐵，鉛，江西之鎢，　，銻，廣西之錫和桐油，以及東南諸省重要軍需工業資源，也因桂林之矣，而全部喪失。第三，幾年來在西南的軍事政治·經濟·文化方面的建設，以桂林之失，大部份崩潰·特別是文化方面，桂林是重慶文化心臟，又是反蔣文化人所安身之地，一旦被破壞，不僅文化損失，將因此增加政洽上的分離。第四，民族資本家吳鼎昌所領導的工業建設，大部份在貴州省內，今直接在日軍威脅之下，而重慶在軍事上失去屏障，日軍有寶　四川　地可　，一切工業建設受到打擊，第五，渝方七，三九三個戰區，勢必從此與重慶隔絕，這些龐大軍事力量，無法利用，不在荒山中自生自滅，便將參加和運。特別是遠征於五戰區的李宗仁軍，對於桂林的失守，將感更大的衝動，幾年爲國努力的結果，使數萬佳兒無家可歸，這種悲痛情緒，是重慶與地方關係上的　隙，將影響到五戰區的軍事。　　其次，在太平洋方面的戰爭歷時雖已四旬，而戰攀還滯留於菲律賓的雷伊泰島。敵美自從十月二十日登陸雷伊泰島後，竭力增强登陸步隊，企岡推進空軍基地，切斷菲島日軍防衛綫成爲南北兩段。這是敵美在加達爾康納爾戰役以來，一貫側重於推進航空基地的一貫戰術。不過敵美在雷伊泰島建設空軍基地，並非易事，一切燃料彈藥以及設備資材，均須火量運輸船從事補給。敵美縱以優勢物質不惜重大犧牲，但是經不起日本航空部隊奮不顧身的衝擊。例如十月廿八廿九兩日，塔克羅班飛行場經日軍猛炸，全區化爲火海，剛剛着陸的P58型及格拉曼戰鬥機數十架，瞬即全部毀滅。十一月十六日敵美陸軍次長巴特生發表談話，承認作戰困難。他說：「日本海軍現依然給予吾人重大威脅，空軍也漸增攻擊力，陸軍戰力發展程度，更爲龐大。縱使德國戰敗，日本必將繼續戰鬥。」可見敵美初以爲優勢物質必可壓倒一切，但經匝月的戰鬥，遭遇日軍猛烈攻擊，已知當初的幻想不能實現了。一方面日軍更展開神風特別攻擊隊的活動，充分發揮精神勝物質的特點，自十月二十五日至十一月二十六日之一個月問，神風隊已經擊沉敵艦十六艘，擊毀二十六艘，其中航空母艦佔十四艘之多。日陸軍特別攻擊隊也獲驚人戰果，自十一月十二日至二十七日的半個月中，沉毀滅敵十七艘。綜合各方面情形觀察，菲島戰爭的趨勢，第一，敵美補給綫太長，在補給綫之前端，復從事激烈戰鬥，無法充分利用補給物資。第二，敵美唯一戰術，推進難立航空基地，但因日軍的緊迫作戰，使無喘息機會，無法完成目的。第三，雷伊泰島登陸部隊業已逐漸縮小包圍圈，頗有全部被殲的可能。所以，菲島戰爭的趨勢，決不如敵美所幻想的成就。換句話說，敵美對菲作戰，企圖牽制中國大陸日軍的銳進，以及掩飾渝美空軍基地覆減的敗績，是完全粉碎了。　　日軍在中國大陸以及太平洋上的戰果，不斷擴展中，足以證明日軍業已取得決定性的勝利，更加促成大東亞各國各民族，由必勝信念走向必勝體制。因此，目前的重慶政權，巳經遭遇到前所未有的困難，軍事上的頹勢無法挽回，甚且無法阻擋日軍的前進。同時，太平洋敵美海戰的敗覆，對渝是致命打擊，十一月十六日重慶各報一致發表日本大本營的戰報，重慶政權採取這蘊方法指導輿論，還是大東亞戰爭以來的第一次，顯然，這是重慶當局對於太平洋戰爭前途的估計，已經失掉了信心。即敵美駐渝的新聞記者，也都在憂急地報道「重慶當局認爲太平洋戰局將急轉直下」。這不是英美報人的神經過敵，而是從現象中看到了本質。　　由於日美在台菲海戰的經過，重慶也已恍悟，日本是擁有粉碎英美反攻的戰爭實力的。這次海戰更給予重慶一個啓示，就是依靠英美「打倒日本」，不過是虛妄的幻想。其次，英首相邱吉爾曾在下院譏笑重慶是協約國陣營內最脆弱的一環，是不能抗戰的，不會抗戰專爲內亂的政府。所以，重慶一般人相信挽救重慶，不能依靠英美，這次敵美海軍的覆敗，更加强了重慶人士的這一傾向。　　然而，重慶有了啓示，有了覺悟，而沒有勇氣，還是不足以挽救困厄的。目前戰爭的趨勢已經很易判明，而大東亞戰爭的本質，也早已有事實的顯示，處於淚與笑之間的重慶，願意笑還是願意淚，已至最後抉擇的機會了。新中國報新聞報申報報　聯合徴文　　大東亞戰爭發動以來，瞬將三年，目前已入決戰階段，最後勝利之基礎，雖已奠定，而如何堅定信念？如何集結總力？實有益加淬勵之必要，以期及早完遂勝利。本報等爰於三周紀念之日，發行特刊，並以上述理念爲中心題材，公開徵文，分爲論文新詩舊詩標語四種。尚祈讀者不吝惠賜佳作。茲訂簡則如次：　　（一）內容：論文以堅定勝利信念，喚起決戰情緒爲主，詩及標語以頌贊擊滅英美完遂勝利，並堅定決戰勝利信念爲主。叙述務必簡明扼要。（二）文體：論文及標語，文言白話不拘。新詩用白話，舊詩絕句及律詩均可。（三）字數：論文每籍二千字以內，新詩十行至二十行，舊詩及標語無限制。（四）截止：十二月五目。（五）揭曉：十二月八日。（六）發表：最佳作品，十二月八日在本報等特刋分別發表，其餘酌載定期刋物。（七）評選：論文由申報評選，新詩由新中國報評選，舊詩由新聞報評選，標語由三報共同評選。（八）獎金：每種各取十名。論文第一名一萬元，第二名六千元，第三名四千元，第四名至第十名各二千元。新舊詩，第一名六千元，第二名四千，第三名二千元，第四名至第十名各一千元。標語第一名三千元，第二名二千元，第三名一千元，第四至第十名各五百元。（九）附記：應徵者記明姓名及地址，附同印鑑，論文寄申報編輯部，新詩及標語寄新中國報編輯部，舊詩寄新聞報編輯部，信封標明「應徵」字樣</p>

<h3 id="e1">Jingguo and Kamikaze Special Units Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships in Leyte Gulf; Japanese Navy's New Type 1 Land-based Attack Aircraft Team Achieve Success <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 30th: (1) Six aircraft of the Jingguo Flying Unit, a Japanese special attack force, fiercely attacked enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on November 29th. Among them, two aircraft sank one enemy battleship, and three aircraft each sank one large transport ship. In addition, one battleship or cruiser was damaged and caught fire. Afterwards, two Japanese escort fighters have not yet returned. (2) The members of the Jingguo Flying Unit participating in this attack are as follows: Army Second Lieutenant Akira Otsubo, Tsugihiko Hata, Army Corporal Kazuto Ishii, Hideo Matsui, Tadamasa Terashima, and Tetsuzo Kawashima.</p>
<p>Philippine Japanese Military Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force fiercely bombed enemy naval forces reinforcing Leyte Island on the 27th.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese new Type 1 land-based attack aircraft team has repeatedly achieved remarkable feats since the start of the war. The Type 1 land-based attack aircraft is a twin-engine, mid-range attack aircraft with excellent performance. The aircraft's shape resembles a cigar's wrapper, but on the front lines, it is affectionately called the "Type 1 Attack Aircraft." It can effectively perform bombing and torpedo attacks. Therefore, since the start of the war, it has roamed the skies and achieved remarkable feats. This attack squadron has also participated in operations, causing enemy hearts to tremble with fear.</p>
<p>Tominaga Lieutenant General Expresses Determination</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – Lieutenant General Tominaga, commander of the Japanese Air Force in the Philippines, when meeting with a group of reporters on the 29th, expressed his determination as follows: The air battle is decisive. There cannot be a second time in this battle. This time, our army's soldiers will form special attack units several times, using a tactic of one plane against one ship, which is unparalleled in its bravery. This spirit will naturally make the Philippine battle situation increasingly profound. However, with this spirit of self-sacrifice, we will surely be able to defeat the enemy who relies on material strength. If every soldier has this fearless spirit, they can put down their firearms and, lightly armed with bombs, charge towards enemy tanks and artillery positions. This has been seen repeatedly on the Leyte front. Our army can only retain food and ammunition. I am certain that we will win this war.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Leyte Island Japanese Suicide Squad Raids Enemy Flank; American Supply Route Has Been Cut Off <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army built a strong defensive position on the high ground west of Tagami on Leyte Island, they invited attacks from the enemy and repeatedly penetrated deep into enemy positions, inflicting heavy blows. They once braved heavy rain to charge into enemy positions and launch fierce attacks, achieving great results. An eight-man suicide squad led by Second Lieutenant So-and-so braved the rain on the 17th, carrying two light machine guns, and penetrated deep into the forest, climbing rocks, and circling around to the enemy's flank. At that time, the enemy, believing that the Japanese army would not attack due to the heavy rain, gathered in tents to chat. The Japanese army continued to advance and ordered two machine gunners to guard key points. The other six men, led by Second Lieutenant So-and-so, advanced. After the Second Lieutenant gave the order, the six brave warriors suddenly advanced, approaching the enemy's tents. At this time, the enemy, unprepared for the sudden Japanese attack, fell into chaos. After discovering a retreat route, they scrambled to escape. At this time, the two machine gunners, who were waiting in ambush, fiercely strafed them, leaving behind fifty or sixty bodies. The eight Japanese soldiers were not injured and safely returned to their defense.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The American forces along the coast of Carigara Bay on Leyte Island have suffered heavy losses due to prolonged fierce attacks by the Japanese army after their land supply routes were cut off. However, they continue to resist. In particular, the American forces in the Managanas area are even more helpless. They previously attempted to advance towards the area around Limon with a portion of their forces, but were quickly repelled by the Japanese army and fled into the deep mountains to the northwest. After the Japanese army cut off the road from Carigara to Hinamungaran on the 20th, they further penetrated into the American positions, achieving great results and continuing to attack the American left flank south of Managanas. In addition, the Japanese army is advancing from the east and will continue to pursue the enemy in the mountains. There is no major change in the battle line in the Buri-Tagaami area. The Japanese ambush team in that area penetrated into the coconut groves around Halo, destroyed two enemy howitzers, and then returned. On the western Leyte coast, in the mountain area, on the morning of the 25th, with artillery support, the Japanese army broke into Dam County near Waigak and occupied the area. Also, the Japanese army advancing eastward from the south of Catandatan has broken into enemy positions near the Istan River, causing great confusion. The Japanese army is still continuing its fierce attack.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 33rd (Central News Agency) – On the afternoon of the 27th, around 8:30 PM, the Japanese air force bombed the enemy airfield in Tacloban and the material storage depots in the city, causing fires and destroying more than four facilities.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Carries Out Surprise Attacks on Two Routes</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison in northern Leyte is still fiercely attacking the enemy forces in Capoocan and Carahag, and on the 27th, they cut off the highway between these two locations and the highway to Managanas, completely isolating the enemy. Therefore, the enemy forces in the Managanas and Li- areas can only contact the rear through the roads. In central Leyte, after the new Japanese troops arrived in Caridad, they are landing in Papa and putting pressure on the enemy. By the 27th, they had still defeated the enemy retreating to the high ground north of Caridad and advanced to the outskirts of Caridad, continuing to attack the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Regiment of the enemy's 7th Division. Because of the Japanese attack, the enemy withdrew to Timla-an and set up a defensive position facing the sea to prevent Japanese attacks, and had fourteen 10-inch howitzers. However, on the night of the 27th, the Japanese army launched a surprise attack on the enemy with new troops, and successfully attacked both flanks. The main force of the enemy in that area is still under attack.</p>
<p>Leyte Operations: Characteristics – Remarks by a Japanese Military Staff Officer</p>
<p>A staff officer from a certain Japanese military base recently returned from the front lines of Leyte Island. Regarding the battle situation on the island and the fierce fighting of the Japanese army, he said: The characteristics of the Leyte operation are: First, the American supply route is too long, and the Americans must engage in combat at the front end of this long supply route. The airfields that can be relied upon at this front end cannot be fully used, so the enemy is suffering deeply. However, the enemy is trying to compensate for its weaknesses with material strength. On the other hand, the Japanese army is fighting within its own sphere of influence, and the rear has air force bases. Second, the enemy relied on superior mobile forces to overwhelm the Japanese air force during the landing on Leyte Island, but suffered repeated setbacks, so its landing operation did not proceed as scheduled. Third, this operation is different from the battles in New Guinea, Saipan, and other places, because the Japanese army was able to deploy a large combat force from the front to fight hard under various unique circumstances, and also adopted tactics of hand-to-hand combat and surprise attacks. The success of the Japanese assault troops on Peleliu Island is unprecedented. At the same time, Japanese aircraft are also unusually active, and the Navy is also responding and deploying. Moreover, the number of volunteers for the Leyte Island assault team is now greater than before.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 30th: Between 0:00 and 4:30 AM on the 30th, a small squadron of approximately twenty enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana Islands attacked the vicinity of Tokyo and part of the Tokaido region several times. They dropped bombs from high altitudes above the clouds in indiscriminate attacks, causing fires in several areas. However, some fires were immediately extinguished, and those that were still burning were extinguished around 5:30 AM. There was no damage to important facilities, and personnel injuries were very minor.</p>

<p>Bengbu, 30th (Central News Agency) – Luo Junqiang, the Governor of Anhui Province and Pacification Commissioner, returned to the province from Nanjing on the 30th after traveling to the capital on official business. He immediately met with the heads of various agencies, inquired about the political situation, and met with reporters, stating that he had traveled to Nanjing on official business a month ago and then went to Shanghai. Coincidentally, Chairman Wang passed away in Japan, so he immediately returned to Nanjing to attend the funeral ceremony. He then attended the temporary plenary meeting of the Sixth Central Committee, the National Conference of Administrative Chiefs, and the conference of responsible personnel from provincial party headquarters convened by Acting Chairman Chen. After completing his duties, he returned to the provincial capital. The military and civilians of this province, coinciding with the national mourning, are even more inspired to work hard in their grief.

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Soong Mei-ling went to South America from Chongqing this summer and also visited the United States. She was in New York in early September for medical treatment. Regarding this matter, the Daily Mail of Calcutta reported that Soong Mei-ling's trip to the United States was not just for medical treatment, because Chiang Kai-shek has separated from Soong Mei-ling. Soong Mei-ling is planning to reside temporarily in the United States, fearing that she will stay there for a long time, so she will give speeches related to the Chinese situation. However, according to the Chongqing Central News Agency's Washington dispatch, Kong Xiangxi, the former Minister of Finance of Chongqing stationed in the United States, denied this, saying that Soong Mei-ling intends to reside for a long time on the coast of Miami, Florida, and that the news that Soong Mei-ling wanted to return to Chongqing was purely false.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – In the recent reorganization in Chongqing, the dismissal of Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin and Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is most noteworthy. According to a Chongqing dispatch: Zhang Pingdeng, a spokesman for the Chongqing authorities, stated to a group of reporters on the 29th as follows: The changes of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were both requested by the individuals themselves. Zhang also speculated on the reasons for He Yingqin's resignation in his capacity as a spokesman, saying that it was because he had concurrently held the positions of Minister of Military Affairs and Chief of Staff for the past two years. Also, Kong Xiangxi resigned from his position as Minister of Finance due to poor health, and at the same time left his position as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. The successor has not yet been selected.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia Electrical Communications Conference was previously held in Tokyo, where it was decided to fix the calculation method for telegram place names, that is, regardless of the number of words in the name and address of the recipient, a fixed number of words will be charged for the telegram. It is now learned that the Huazhong Electrical Communications Department has decided that starting today, all telegrams sent to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, whether in Chinese or Japanese, will be calculated using a fixed number of words. As in the past, Japanese telegrams will charge two words for the name and address of the recipient. For Chinese telegrams, starting today, the name and address of the recipient will be charged at a fixed rate of three words, regardless of the number of words. This move greatly reduces the burden on Chinese people sending telegrams, and all parties express their extreme satisfaction. However, telegram senders should strive to write the recipient's name and address as simply as possible, and the telegraph office has the right to delete words. It is hoped that all circles will pay attention to this point.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Special Fundraising Team for Scholarship Funds <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Shēnbào Readers' Scholarship Fund Achievement Exhibition opens today at the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge, and at the same time, we are launching the Eighth Shēnbào Readers' Scholarship Special Fundraising Team. See page 3 of today's newspaper for the regulations.</p>
<p>With full enthusiasm, we hope that readers will help us—no, help the entire society, the entire China—with scholarship work. In recent years, the movement to rescue young people from dropping out of school has become a general social consensus of "intercommunication," and it has become a "mutual assistance" work for the general public. The achievements of the scholarship movement can at least be said to be the greatest of many "intercommunication" and "mutual assistance" movements. Taking this newspaper as an example, the amount of scholarship funds was 33,73.60 yuan in the first session, 51,587.50 yuan in the second session, 147,531.50 yuan in the third session, 236,431.00 yuan in the fourth session, 1,382,547.00 yuan in the fifth session, 3,256,316.00 yuan in the sixth session, and 14,193,160.00 yuan in the seventh session. The number of students receiving scholarships was 1,005 in the first session, 984 in the second session, 1,156 in the third session, 1,629 in the fourth session, 4,013 in the fifth session, 4,621 in the sixth session, and 4,658 in the seventh session. Whether from the perspective of the amount of money or the number of students, the achievements of each session have always exceeded the previous session by several times. On the one hand, this shows how eager society is for assistance, and on the other hand, it shows how hard the Shēnbào readers have worked.</p>
<p>Since the need for scholarships is so pressing, and the increase in tuition fees is an unavoidable fact, before the end of each semester and before the start of the next scholarship campaign, we see the achievements of the scholarship students and receive requests for continued support. Everyone is always happy and surprised. What the readers and we are happy about is that the achievements of the scholarship students have all reached everyone's expectations, and many have even exceeded general ideals, making everyone feel that these donations, this work, can create such great results. At the same time, what readers and we are surprised about is that in such difficult circumstances, there are so many people in need, and the amount of money needed is so huge, how should everyone continue to work hard. However, based on the results of the past seven sessions, what everyone thought was surprising finally turned into happiness. The amount of donations not only allows the students who have already received assistance to continue their studies, but also allows it to be expanded to new poor and excellent students. The spirit of mutual assistance shown by the Shēnbào readers in such a difficult and challenging environment is not only the glory of this newspaper, but it can also occupy the most glorious page in the history of new Shanghai and the history of new China.</p>
<p>Now the spring semester of the 34th year of the Republic of China is about to begin. A part of the gratifying achievements has been displayed in the exhibition, which is something that the readers of this newspaper believe is worth congratulating to the people of Shanghai and China. At the same time, the surprising facts are also immediately placed before us. According to the current number of students receiving assistance, the amount of donations, and the trend of tuition fee documents in the next semester, the time to the real start of school is only two months, the time is so short, the number of excellent students in need of assistance now is so large, and the amount of donations needed is so large. This is really the most urgent, the most difficult, and the most challenging thing. However, with our consistently unwavering confidence in the past and with the full enthusiasm of the people of Shanghai, we can make the hearts of the people of Shanghai interconnected, and we can all work together to do this work of mutual assistance. We firmly believe that this work of rescuing the urgent, the suffering, and the needy will surely have unexpected results.</p>
<p>1,000 teams and 20 million yuan is just a minimum. Together with the existing donations, it is only enough to maintain the existing scholarship students to continue their studies. Because these many students are flowers that the readers have personally cultivated and irrigated with their blood and sweat over the years, no matter how difficult it is, we must not let them wither and wither, and make everyone give up their previous efforts. This newspaper and its colleagues are ashamed of their meager resources, and we will each donate 100,000 yuan to organize two teams. We dare not say that it is a promotion, but we dare to express our meager intentions. We firmly believe that the scholarship movement is already everyone's joint work, and educating the next generation is the only and most practical thing on the road to nation-building. At this critical moment, everyone will surely be able to use the power of the masses to promote this joint work and complete this common ambition.</p>
<p>We respectfully request readers to donate more.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Japanese Air and Land Forces Fiercely Attack; Enemy in Morotai Threatened; Djalaluddin Airport Can No Longer Be Used <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Southern Front, 30th (Central News Agency) – The losses of Leyte Island and the surrounding areas of the Philippine Islands in recent days have been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters successively. Among them, the most noteworthy is the most important supply base of the enemy, Morotai Island, which is closest to the Philippine Islands. The elite troops of the Japanese army, with high morale, have been conducting fierce surprise attacks around the enemy airfield, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. At the same time, the Japanese air force has continued to attack day and night, causing the enemy to lose many aircraft. Especially since the large-scale bombing on the night of the 22nd, the continuous bombing has made the supply base ineffective. The firepower of the enemy base cannot withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese air and land forces. The battle line has been reduced, and strong defenses have been established around the airfield, adopting a tactic of avoiding war as much as possible. The enemy forces, which have always been arrogant, have now turned to the first priority of defense.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army air force has been fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in Djalaluddin on Morotai Island for days, and the army assault teams have launched surprise attacks. The airfield can no longer be used completely. The enemy forces have been rebuilding the airfield for days as a supply base for Leyte. Since the 26th, the aircraft concentrated on the island have been flying in the air day and night as patrol aircraft to prevent attacks by Japanese aircraft. At the same time, land forces have been concentrated around the airfield to prevent Japanese surprise attacks. Therefore, Morotai Island, the enemy's supply base, is clearly threatened.</p>
<p>Southwest Pacific Base, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force fiercely bombed the enemy airfield in Morotai around 1:00 AM on the 29th, completely hitting the airfield while braving the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire. All Japanese aircraft returned to their defenses safely.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Achievements</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison on Morotai Island has been conducting large-scale aggressive attacks since the enemy began landing, causing the enemy to tremble with fear, and has been conducting large-scale bombings of enemy ground facilities with powerful firepower. At the same time, the new Japanese reinforcement troops have also made reverse landings and have been successful. In addition, some enemy airfields can no longer be used due to attacks by Japanese ground forces. The Japanese military achievements from the enemy landing on September 15th to November 21st are as follows: (1) The Japanese army killed 2,831 enemies. (2) The Japanese army captured 2 enemy mortars and 14 boxes of ammunition. (3) Destroyed 2 enemy heavy artillery pieces, 4 anti-aircraft guns, 1 machine gun, 5 boats, 1 tractor, 1 power supply vehicle, 1 wooden house, 73 military camps, 5 covered positions, and 1 material accumulation area.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Base on the Southern Front, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force has been fiercely attacking Morotai Island for days, and the enemy's aircraft supply base has completely lost its function. Sergeant Ota Bin, of a certain unit of Japanese aircraft participating in the attack on the 27th, talked about the fierce attack as follows: When my plane invaded the local airspace, it was illuminated by a bright moon. Sparks came out of the shelter on the north side of the enemy airfield, and then the fire expanded horizontally. This was caused by a bomb dropped by my friendly aircraft hitting the enemy aircraft inside the shelter and igniting it. Soon the fire expanded, and a fierce pillar of fire soared into the sky, and at the same time it exploded with a roar. The shelter area was surrounded by fire. Looking back on the return trip, I saw that the airfield was a river of fire.</p>

<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch) – U.S. bomber squadrons conducted a massive terror bombing of Cologne, an ancient city in western Germany, on the afternoon of the 27th. Hospitals, retirement homes, public buildings, monuments, and other structures were destroyed. According to German military reports: Bombs penetrated Cologne Cathedral, destroying the roof. Not only were the holy city and sacristy completely ruined, but all other areas were also damaged beyond repair. The cathedral is a world-renowned architectural landmark.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Enemy U.S. Fleet in Disarray, Japanese Forces Launch Annihilation Campaign, Minister Matsushima's Congratulatory Speech at Joint Exercises <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Minister Matsushima, the press officer of the allied Matsushima Fleet, spoke at the second Shanghai citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the British and Americans, recounting how the Japanese Navy had valiantly engaged and decimated the enemy U.S. fleet in the Pacific, starting from the waters off Ryukyu and Taiwan on October 10th of this year and continuing through fierce battles in Leyte Gulf in the Philippines. The results were remarkable, and the enemy U.S. fleet is now in a state of disarray. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy U.S. Losses in Three Stages</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima stated, "I am deeply grateful to all of you for your enthusiastic participation today. I will now provide a comprehensive report on the current situation in the Pacific and the future course of the Greater East Asia War. The current battle between Japan and the U.S. began on October 10th of this year and has been extremely fierce. We can divide it into three stages: first, from October 10th to October 30th; second, from November 1st to November 15th; and third, from November 15th to the present. The enemy U.S. operation was intended to assist General MacArthur's landing operation in the Philippines via New Guinea. The U.S. risked everything, deploying its entire navy and the most elite troops. In this operation, the enemy U.S. forces attacked from both north and south. In the north, the Third Fleet led by Halsey and the Fifth Fleet led by Spruance suffered losses of no fewer than 250 warships and over 1,500 aircraft, not to mention other losses. The enemy's forces, starting from Ryukyu and Taiwan on October 10th, were met with a head-on attack by the Japanese forces, who decimated the enemy U.S. Third Fleet. In the south, from New Guinea to Leyte Gulf, the second stage of the operation began on November 1st and lasted until November 15th. From the battle off Taiwan to the battlefield in the Philippines, the Japanese Navy, under the command of the Combined Fleet, annihilated the enemy U.S. Navy. In the third stage, the enemy suffered heavy losses, including 15 battleships, over 50 aircraft carriers, over 300 other ships of various sizes, and over 1,000 aircraft. The magnificent results were achieved by the heroic kamikaze special attack units, who conducted suicide attacks with their aircraft. It is noteworthy that the Japanese Combined Fleet, which had been built up in secret for years after the Washington Naval Treaty, appeared off the eastern coast of the Philippines and struck a blow to the enemy U.S. fleet. The battles on November 25th and 26th were particularly fierce, and the enemy U.S. Navy in the Pacific was seen fleeing at the sight of the Japanese forces. General King of the enemy U.S. praised the Japanese forces for their courage in the face of extreme difficulty, which shows the enemy's own difficulties and heavy losses. They have lost five aircraft carriers, leaving them with only ten, so they are no longer capable of naval operations. This decisive battle is now in its final stage, and the enemy's plans are unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>Enemy U.S. Attempts to Cover Up Defeats</p>
<p>Initially, the enemy launched a fierce attack on Leyte Gulf with three divisions and a desperate invasion with transport convoys. To date, they have landed ten divisions, which shows the heavy losses suffered by the enemy U.S. and the intensity of the battles between Japan and the U.S. In the current situation in that area, the Japanese forces still control the sea and air, and are launching annihilation campaigns on land. The enemy U.S. is attempting to cover up their defeats. President Roosevelt is vague about the Pacific campaign, which shows the difficulties the enemy U.S. is facing. In the wake of their defeats, the only base tactic the enemy U.S. has is to bomb the Japanese mainland and Shanghai in order to undermine the Japanese military's morale and agitate the people of Shanghai, which is not worth taking seriously. The enemy is resorting to any means because they have achieved nothing on the battlefield, so they will likely engage in more foolish actions in the future, especially in the Pacific and on the mainland. It is worth noting that the U.S. military's purpose in invading the Philippines was to transport large numbers of troops to China in the first place to turn Chongqing into a battlefield and harm innocent Chinese civilians, and to cut off Japan's mainland from its southern resource areas. However, the enemy U.S.'s plans have failed. With the fall of Guilin and Liuzhou, the enemy U.S.'s air bases in Chongqing have been completely destroyed, and they have been unable to cut off Japan's mainland from its southern resource areas. In the past, the enemy planes and submarines bombed indiscriminately in the South China Sea, and their bases were in Guilin and Liuzhou. The successes of submarine activities were also achieved there. Now, the loss of Guilin and Liuzhou has dealt a fatal blow to the enemy.</p>
<p>Actually Interfering in Chongqing's Internal Affairs</p>
<p>In the future, the enemy will be unable to act on the mainland, except to attempt to use B-29 long-range bombers. They will also use political strategies to incite disturbances in Chongqing. For example, Nelson's visit to Chongqing was intended to resolve the diplomatic tension between Chongqing and the U.S. after Stilwell's unhappy return to the U.S., and to plan future operations. In addition, they are pretending to increase Chongqing's production, but in reality, they are interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs and seizing control of U.S. power in Chongqing. Ultimately, the Chongqing regime will be manipulated by the U.S. Song Ziwen's statement in the U.S., at the last time, that China would not allow foreign interference in Chongqing's internal affairs at any time, shows that Chongqing's internal affairs are being suppressed and encroached upon. Even the U.S.'s establishment of a wartime production bureau in Chongqing must have the following four conditions: (1) capital, (2) labor, (3) production facilities, and (4) transportation. Except for labor, the remaining three are all in Japan's hands. Even production facilities must rely on the U.S. How can Chongqing's combat power be replenished? Even if it is transported from India via the Himalayas, the total amount is only over 20,000 tons, which is only one-tenth of what Chongqing needs. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 29th, the Propaganda Department, fearing Liang Han Cao, made a statement to the press: The Chongqing government has a deep understanding of the current situation in China and is confident of final victory. China must also be strengthened in the world war, and the U.S. is also very concerned about China's mainland operations. However, material assistance will surely be realized in the future, and the U.S.'s military agreement with Chongqing can also be strengthened. This shows that in the past, the U.S.'s material assistance to Chongqing has not been realized at all.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Wipe Out British and Americans</p>
<p>In the current mainland operation, Japan is not targeting China, but is wiping out the British and American forces in Chongqing. The Chongqing side relies on British and American military assistance, but it is not satisfied and is willing to be enslaved by the British and Americans, causing the people to suffer needlessly. Japan has never stopped planning to assist China, and the 450 million Chinese people also hope that full peace will come soon. Regarding the European war situation, the mistakes and complications of the British, American, and Soviet Union mean that when the situation comes to an end, the British and Soviet Union will not send a single troop to the Pacific to help. Therefore, Japan will not stop until the final victory, no matter how the situation changes in the future. At the same time, we have the cooperation of the allied Chinese people, and we will advance together towards the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of living and dying together. The enemy is resorting to all kinds of divisive tactics, such as air raids and spreading rumors, in order to stimulate prices. This absurd rumor is no more than deceiving children. At this time when China and Japan are fighting side by side in unity, this rumor will be dispelled by itself, and we firmly believe that final victory will belong to us. We hope that in the future, we will maintain a sincere and united spirit to save China, achieve genuine and complete peace, and complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Enemy U.S. Operational Situation Has Fallen Into Disarray <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi's Congratulatory Speech at Joint Exercises</p>
<p>Minister Izubuchi, the press officer of the allied Japanese Army in Shanghai, gave the following speech at the second Shanghai citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the enemy British and Americans:</p>
<p>Clearing Out Enemy U.S. Forces in China</p>
<p>The purpose of the current operation by our forces in Hunan and Guangxi, as stated by the Imperial Government and the operational forces at the beginning, is to thoroughly destroy the U.S. forces in China and leave not a single soldier on the Chinese mainland. Because we recently occupied Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and destroyed the many air bases built by the enemy U.S. Air Force in southwestern China to the greatest extent, it can be said that one of the purposes of this operation has been completed. Of course, this does not mean that the operational mission has ended. The enemy U.S. Air Force attempted to carry out encirclement bombing of Japan from the Chinese mainland, and to import aircraft into China to seek air bases in China. They first chose the southwest and southeast regions centered on Guilin and Hengyang. This area is the most appropriate location for spying on our mainland and for coordinating with Pacific operations. The enemy first chose this area, with Guilin and Hengyang as the core, and cleverly deployed many air bases. Thus, they brazenly called it an air fortress. However, the fall of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning revealed that the enemy's boasted mainland air fortress was so fragile that it collapsed. This huge military failure cannot be denied by anyone. If we conclude from this that the U.S. military has retreated from the mainland, this is naturally an impermissible mistake. We can imagine that if they lose the first air base, they will seek the second and third bases and desperately hold on to them. Therefore, our operational forces will not stop pursuing the enemy as long as a single U.S. soldier remains on the mainland.</p>
<p>Chongqing Regime Leads Wolves into the House</p>
<p>The purpose of this operation, as mentioned earlier, is to clear out the enemy U.S. forces on the Chinese mainland. However, our current major enemy is the Chongqing army, and the battlefield is still Chinese territory. This is an unavoidable thing in the current stage of the war, and it is also a heartbreaking thing. If the Chongqing regime had not led wolves into the house by introducing the enemy U.S. forces into the Chinese mainland, perhaps this operation would not have been necessary. At the same time, if the Chongqing army had not assisted the U.S. military, had not defended its air bases, and had not resisted our Imperial Army, it would not have suffered this disastrous defeat, nor would it have sacrificed countless innocent soldiers. But what has put the Chongqing army in such a tragic situation is really due to the cunning British and American conspiracies to sacrifice other nations and races and carry out their war plans. For example, Britain often drives Indian or African soldiers to the front line to fight, and the U.S. drives Filipinos to fight in the Philippines. On the Chinese mainland, the U.S. drives the Chongqing army to fight against our Imperial Army and allows them to bleed and sacrifice. This is really a cunning British and American conspiracy to fool and sacrifice the Chongqing army. We have only feelings of hatred and pity for Chongqing, but if Chongqing continues to assist the enemy U.S. forces in resisting the Imperial Army, our army can only reluctantly strike them.</p>
<p>Brutal Aggression, Reckless Bombing</p>
<p>However, after recovering from the pain, what makes people's hair stand on end is that innocent people have suffered from the war, lost their homes, and lost their lives because of this operation. Our army, which regards the U.S. military as its only enemy, originally does not hate innocent people, but tries its best to protect them. Sometimes we even endure operational disadvantages and try not to destroy the lives and property of residents. But contrary to the benevolent policies of our Imperial Army, the Chongqing regime specializes in destroying cities, massacring people, and burning property. The U.S. Air Force, which they consider an ally, has recklessly bombed and destroyed cities such as Changsha and Hengyang, exceeding the necessary limits of enemy U.S. operations. This kind of tyranny is truly intolerable. Yesterday, the cities that were still under the control of the Chongqing regime were operating diligently, seeking prosperity and development. Once they fall into the hands of the Japanese army, they are bombed desperately without hesitation the next day, wishing to completely bomb them into flat ground. In their eyes, Chinese culture and the lives and property of Chinese people are not worth considering at all. When we see their brutal situation, we cannot imagine that it is what people do to people. Then why do they dare to do such brutal things? In short, they believe that Chinese territory, people, and the entire Greater East Asia are nothing more than targets of their aggression. So they have no heart to respect Chinese culture, and they know nothing of human love other than enslaving and exploiting people.</p>
<p>They see that their own situation is becoming more and more unfavorable, and they are losing every battle, so their brutality is becoming more and more intense. Recently, when the enemy U.S. Air Force appeared over Shanghai, they blindly bombed residential areas and machine-gunned pedestrians on the road, massacring a large number of innocent citizens and destroying the peaceful life of the citizens. These are all self-destructive behaviors that they have made because they have been defeated everywhere, and they are also strategic psychological warfare tactics to cover up their military failures.</p>
<p>The Activity of the Special Attack Force</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, in coordination with the operation to crush the U.S. forces on the mainland, and in the Pacific, following the great victories off Taiwan, and in the Philippines, due to the activity of our kamikaze special attack forces and the army special attack forces, the war results are gradually expanding. Currently, the enemy U.S. Pacific Fleet has lost most of its military strength. The U.S. military under the command of General MacArthur, who landed on Leyte Island and wanted to recover the Philippines in one fell swoop, is currently in a desperate situation. Under the fierce attack of our air and land forces, in order to rescue this group of soldiers who are lingering, dying, and injured, transport convoys are flocking to Leyte Gulf, and one by one they have become the best targets for our torpedo squadrons and special attack squadrons to bomb, and they are all buried in the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Looking at the above-mentioned overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, if we describe the enemy's strategic situation as a human body, then the general counter-offensive in the Pacific is the right hand, and the mainland invasion force is the left hand, and they want to strangle Japan with these two hands. But the right hand in the Pacific has been cut off its fingers by our Imperial Army and has lost the function of the hand. The left hand on the mainland has been completely broken and has become a useless object. Now the enemy U.S.'s strategic situation has fallen into disarray and is incurable. In the face of our inevitable victory, they are only walking on thin ice, like facing a deep abyss, and have become startled birds and exposed fish.</p>
<p>As announced by the Japanese General Headquarters at 3 p.m. today, the Japanese Army's special attack unit, the Yasukuni Corps, attacked the enemy fleet in Leyte Gulf, sinking one battleship, three transport ships, and destroying one battleship and one cruiser each, causing them to catch fire and burn.</p>
<p>The final decisive battle is getting closer and closer. Our army will expel the enemy British and Americans from the Chinese mainland? from the entire Greater East Asia without leaving a single soldier, until they are unable to invade the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere again. Even if we fight for a hundred years, we will not hesitate. Our 100 million people have the same determination as the soldiers on the front line, and we also deeply know the spirit of the special attack forces active on the front line of the Philippines, and we will charge into battle with the spirit of 100 million suicide squads and defeat the British and Americans. As for the allied China, we earnestly hope that every compatriot will enthusiastically assist the Greater East Asia War and achieve the final goal.</p>

<p>The Shanghai News Federation, China Film Company, Federation of Industry and Commerce, Citizens' Welfare Association, National Diplomacy Promotion Association, and other groups, in view of the decisive stage of the Greater East Asia War, the allied Japanese army exerting its divine power, giving the enemy British and Americans a fatal blow, repeatedly winning battles, and laying the foundation for inevitable victory, specially organized the second citizens' rally to celebrate the elimination of the enemy British and Americans. It was held at the Majestic Theater on Jiangning Road yesterday (30th) at 6:30 p.m., and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. The chairpersons of the rally were Kuniosaka Yoichi, Kawakita Nagamasa, Wen Lanting, Funatsu Tatsuichiro, Lin Kanghou, Feng Jie, Moriyama Takashi, Xu Liqiu (representing Yang Huilang), Jin Xiongbo, Chen Riping, Huang Jingqi, Yuan Shu, and Lu Feng. The general secretary was Ren Lingpeng. First, Lu Feng, the representative of the presidium, gave a speech. Then, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Press Department, Minister Izubuchi of the Army Press Department (speeches see page 2), Minister Matsudaira of the Information Department, Captain Hida, Lieutenant Nakagawa, and Chen Binsu, a standing member of the Municipal Advisory Committee (speech see page 4), gave speeches on the recent war situation and the knowledge that the people should have. Finally, a current affairs film, "The Naval Battle of the Philippines: The Departure of the Kamikaze Special Attack Force," and a new film from Huaying, "Remnants of Spring on the River," were shown. The rally ended at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Lu Feng, the representative of the presidium, said in his speech, "The main significance of the joint holding of the second citizens' victory celebration by various groups today is to enable citizens to understand the development of the current situation and strengthen their belief in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. In the past month, the decisive situation of the Greater East Asia War has developed to the highest stage. In the Pacific, the enemy British and Americans' attacks on Leyte in the Philippines have been repeatedly defeated, especially the brave attacks of the Japanese special attack forces, which have achieved brilliant results. On the Chinese mainland, the Japanese army has successively captured Guilin, Liuzhou, and Nanning, and is continuing to advance towards Guiyang. The enemy British and Americans' air bases on the Chinese mainland are almost completely destroyed. At this stage of successive victories in the war, our hope and efforts should be to prompt Chongqing, which is attached to the British and Americans, to wake up from its dream immediately, to realize full peace immediately, and to unite Chinese forces to cooperate with the allies and jointly shoulder the sacred hope of 'East Asians defending East Asia.'"</p>

<h3 id="e26">Minister Tsuchida's First Broadcast to Japanese Residents in Central China, Striving to Practice Wartime Structure <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>After taking office, Minister Tsuchida, the allied Plenipotentiary Minister to Shanghai, broadcast to Japanese residents in Central China for the first time. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Completing the War</p>
<p>On the occasion of the third anniversary of the Imperial Rescript declaring war, I would like to briefly describe my thoughts on being appointed to this new position to the Japanese residents in Central China. The Imperial tradition of world policy is to first ensure the stability of East Asia, and then seek for all nations in the world to obtain their own place, support each other, base their international justice, and establish world peace. The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of November 6th of last year is based on this spirit, and expresses the common beliefs and determination of the countries of Greater East Asia. On the occasion of the first anniversary of this declaration, the Imperial Government will reaffirm its commitment to building a world order of civil administration, progress, and prosperity based on the spirit of this declaration, eliminating all aggression, threats, monopoly, and exploitation, and respecting the independence and characteristics of all countries. The Greater East Asia War was started because the Japanese Empire was forced to fight due to the unethical oppression of the British and Americans, and for the sake of national defense and self-preservation. At the same time, based on the Imperial tradition of world policy, we have liberated the nations of Greater East Asia from the colonial domination of the British and Americans, and have spared no sacrifice in the war. The countries of Greater East Asia are actively supporting the Japanese Empire in completing the war with a sense of common destiny and solidarity in the alliance. Regarding the relationship between China and Japan, since China entered the war on January 9th of last year, China and Japan have been comrades-in-arms who live and die together, and are truly the main force in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. They have also concluded the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty to establish a permanent friendly relationship between the two countries. However, it is most unfortunate that the leader of China, Chairman Wang Jingwei, passed away on November 10th of this year. The Chinese National Government still inherited his will and issued the following statement: "We vow to lead the military and civilians of the entire country to inherit his will, no matter how difficult, to cooperate with the allies and all friendly nations, to complete the war, and to strive to achieve China's equality and Asia's independence and liberation." I express my deep respect for the Chinese National Government's determination.</p>
<p>Decisive Battle Period</p>
<p>At the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, which has lasted for three years, the enemy American counteroffensive operation has been underway for one year, and we have entered the decisive battle period. The large-scale victories that have shocked the world off the eastern coast of Taiwan and the coast of the Philippines have opened the prelude to the decisive battle. In Leyte Gulf, Japan has achieved unprecedented large-scale victories, and the loyal and brave kamikaze special attack forces, unseen in ancient and modern times, have appeared, causing the enemy forces to tremble with fear. This pure loyalty and great virtue will be remembered for all time. In addition, on the Chinese mainland front, Liuzhou and Guilin have fallen one after another, and the southern Chinese bases of the US Air Force in China have been completely destroyed, completing the great operation to cut off the Chinese mainland. Furthermore, the foundation of the war has been established firmly and unshakably. The main force of the enemy's Pacific Fleet has already been destroyed, and the enemy's air bases in China have also been destroyed. The enemy, boasting of its abundant resources, will surely reorganize its forces and attempt a second and third counterattack. We must take advantage of this momentum, gather the total strength of Greater East Asia, and increase our combat power in order to achieve final victory. The ultimate outcome of this war depends on the strength of our will to fight and the strength of our decisive battle system. Therefore, we must make continuous efforts with a renewed determination to achieve the sacred goal of national defense and East Asian prosperity. The wartime consciousness and wartime structure of the Japanese residents currently residing in Central China are regrettable compared to those in Japan. However, I am pleased to see that you have recently been working hard to accelerate the realization of the wartime structure. The Japanese residents in China are promoters of friendship and goodwill between the peoples of Japan and China. They should reflect the image of a bright and cheerful great nation in the eyes of the Chinese, deepen the Chinese's trust in Japan, and ensure their cooperation with a large and friendly national demeanor. Japanese residents in China must thoroughly implement the spirit of the Alliance Treaty, and each Japanese resident must be based on this awareness, with unity and gathering of total strength as the foundation, and open up the path of Sino-Japanese friendship and war power. Strengthening the path to victory requires Japanese residents in China to embody the spirit of the Great Decree and express their devotion to public service. At this time, it is even more appropriate to elaborate on the main points of the local measures.</p>
<p>Working Together</p>
<p>The first is to increase combat power. In the Central China region, we must obtain national defense resources, and military officers and civilians must work together to overcome difficulties and seek rationalization of operations. Especially with regard to strengthening transportation, we must eliminate transportation obstacles and vigorously develop the spirit of standing up and serving the wartime transportation. In order to increase combat power, enterprises must also gradually strengthen and should use your strengths. You must be aware of being rear-line soldiers and take pride in increasing combat power, stand up and serve the public, and engage in the work of increasing production and increasing transportation. The second is to maintain and develop the economy of Central China. The current economy of Central China, especially in terms of industry and transportation, is in a state of stagnation, and we must make special efforts. Industry operators must do their utmost to cooperate in completing the decisive battle of operations. In order to enhance combat power, not only military officers and various agencies, but also national policy companies and private companies, must cooperate closely with the military, promote the Yamato spirit, and deal with it decisively in order to achieve the highest degree of success. The speculation, hoarding, and raising of prices that hinder the smooth operation of the Central China economy must be resolutely banned. The Chinese side has worked hard to implement it, and we must also work hard, and Japanese residents in China must never engage in such behavior. Finally, I hope that Japanese residents will strengthen their individual decisive battle lives, and should never tend to loosen up due to recent price issues, but will implement the same decisive battle life as their compatriots in Japan, and join hands with Chinese allies to achieve final victory. I hope that you will be ready to face the situation and move forward also.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Following Chairman's Last Wish <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>A Letter to the People from the Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>Nation-building must have peace</p>
<p>Counteroffensive is the priority</p>
<p>Since the peace movement started, it is known that "there is no nation-building without peace, and no peace without anti-communism." The declaration of the Sixth National Congress of our party severely condemned the "strategic line of the Chinese Communist Party," which used resistance to expand its strength, overthrow the government, artificially communize, obstruct Sino-Japanese peace, and act as an internal traitor for Soviet plots. Today, even those who have repeatedly tolerated the communists in the past have reached a point where they can no longer tolerate them. And those who proudly think they can hold the Communist Party hostage will also realize that they will ultimately not be tolerated by the Communist Party and will deeply regret that they were actually fooled by the Communist Party, falling into their deadly trap of defeating them one by one and peeling them layer by layer. The "full text of the CCP's resolution" openly and wantonly insults and scolds its so-called right-wingers. For its so-called left-wingers, it personally praised them, but secretly despised them, which is even more vicious and sinister than the "strategic line of the Chinese Communist Party." And the so-called "using war to deal with war" is already an open secret. This kind of plan is not so much a strategy as it is a political conspiracy. During the paper war, the external war will not have ended and the internal war will have already begun, so how can the so-called resistance camp stand it? After the paper war, the external war will have just ended and the internal war will follow, so how can we take care of the aftermath after being devastated and falling back into a situation of division and disintegration? How can we not feel chilled when we think of this? This is the story of our chairman leading the anti-communist struggle after the death of the premier. This is what all our comrades and compatriots should inherit and carry through to the end.</p>
<p>The struggle in the second half of the national revolution is directly focused on seeking freedom and equality for China. The more intense the revolution progresses, the more severe the counter-revolution will be. The more careful and firm our response must be. Looking back at the past twenty years, the strategies of the imperialists against us can be roughly divided into four periods: The first period was a frontal attack, trying to frustrate the budding of revolutionary forces and prevent them from developing and growing. The demonstration of warships in Bai'etan, Guangzhou in the winter of the twelfth year, and the mutiny of the merchant corps in the autumn of the thirteenth year, started the beginning. The May 30th Massacre in Shanghai in the fourteenth year, followed by the June 23rd Massacre in Guangzhou, ran rampant. However, the imperialists' cruel and ferocious violence was unable to resist the torrent of the revolutionary masses, and they listened to their commands in order to obstruct the corrupt forces of the revolution. In front of the revolutionary masses, they finally collapsed and fell apart one by one. The recovery of the Hankou Concession in the spring of the sixteenth year was an example of the imperialists' failure in this period. The second period was a lateral incitement. After the failure of the initial seven attacks, the imperialists knew that the radical progress of the revolution could not be contained, so they had to strategically retreat, change their appearance, and implement their cunning plan of drawing firewood from under the pot. At first, they split the revolutionary camp in order to soften the people's fighting spirit. Then, they shifted the target of the struggle in order to create opportunities for manipulation. During this period, the most unfortunate thing was the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations. The May 3rd Jinan Incident, the September 18th Incident, the January 28th War, and the battles at various passes of the Great Wall all occurred at this time. All of these gave the imperialists an opportunity to take advantage of. We cannot say that the imperialists' incitement and temptation did not contribute to their evil cause. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Determined to Punish According to Law</p>
<h3 id="e29">The Japanese Army Completely Occupies Nandan Airfield; Chongqing-US Air Force Suffers a Major Blow <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Since capturing Hechi on the 23rd, the Japanese army has continued to pursue the remnants of the Chongqing army. On the 28th at 10:00 AM, they completely occupied Nandan, the last stronghold in Guangxi Province, and its airfield, capturing machine guns, tanks, and other military supplies.</p>
<p>Guangxi Frontline, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing army in Nandan, a strategic point in the border region of Guizhou and Guangxi provinces, mobilized instructors and students from the Dushan branch of the Central Military Academy a month ago. They forced civilians to construct over ten miles of fortified trench positions along the Southwest Highway, deploying elite Hu Zongnan troops and several divisions of the Central Direct Lineage Army. They cooperated with the Chongqing-based US Air Force in an attempt to mount a stubborn resistance, but they were violently assaulted by the Japanese army and fled in disarray.</p>
<p>South China Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese forces in South China captured Nanning, a Chongqing-US Air Force base, on the 24th. On the 28th, they occupied the Nandan airfield in northern Guangxi Province. With the exception of the Baise airfield, all US Air Force bases in the province have collapsed. The Baise airfield, located in the border region of Yunnan and Guangxi provinces, and Nanning were both forward bases for the Chongqing-US forces. After the Japanese army occupied Guilin, Liuzhou, and secured Nanning and Nandan, its importance has been completely lost, greatly hindering the US Air Force's future attempts to launch counterattacks from Baise.</p>
<p>Japanese Air Force Attacks Yunnan Airfields</p>
<p>Burma Frontline Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - On the Burmese front, the Japanese Air Force attacked the Yunanyi Nan airfield, an important stronghold of the Chongqing army along the India-Chongqing air route, on the night of the 28th. Braving the Chongqing army's anti-aircraft fire, they dropped several bombs, causing four large and four small aircraft stationed at the airfield to catch fire. Three large and five small aircraft were destroyed. Furthermore, they inflicted damage on ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3 id="e30">War Situation on the Western Front and in Hungary <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to the Overseas Chinese News Agency: A German military spokesperson stated: Although the American and French tank forces in Alsace have struggled to break through in a pincer formation, they have not yet converged, so they have not been able to complete the encirclement. The German army is separately engaging the leading edges of the enemy's two pincers near Strasbourg and Mulhouse to prevent them from converging. The German forces on the Vosges front are still able to move freely in the rear. Although the battle of Alsace is a mobile war, the situation lacks change. In Lorraine, the German forces are moving closer to the Saar, which is within the Siegfried Line, while the battles of Lorraine and Alsace are still being fought in front of the Siegfried Line. There has been little change in the Battle of Aachen on the thirteenth day. Although the American army has deployed vast manpower and resources, there has been no large-scale development in the Aachen-Julich-Stolberg area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Overseas Chinese News Agency reports: A German military spokesman pointed out yesterday that the Soviet army's advance to Fonfokschen City, 150 kilometers south of Hungary, is a very insidious action. The purpose of the Soviet army's advance is either to bypass both sides of the Danube and probe into Hungary, or to directly approach Plattensee City. In any case, this action carries a serious risk, as they hope to achieve a quick victory and end the Hungarian war before a large contingent of German troops can withdraw from the Balkans.</p>
