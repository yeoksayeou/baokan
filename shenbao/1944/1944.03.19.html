<h3 id="c1">物價問題的核心 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>以為物價問題是由於物價高漲而發生的，這是毫無常識的見解。擁有這種見解者。中是站在物資量與通貨間的比例立塲上，來觀察物價問題而得出來的臆斷，然而這是世間最不通的意見，例如一克辣金剛鑽，從値十萬元或二十萬元，這也決不能成為物價問題。蘇聯對於奢侈品誤以極重的捐稅，所以奢侈品的價格遠高於其他國家。目前日本某種黑巿物品中最高者，甚至有遠超過上海者，然而日本和蘇聯，從未發生過上海這樣的物價問題。總之，物價問題並非是由於物價高漲而發生的，而是由於存在着民衆不得不買高價物品的社會制度，而發生的。日本的黑巿物價雖然不一定便宜，然而因為單眞正生活必需品，可以得到極賤的配給，所以民衆即或根本不照顧高價黑市，也不至於影響生存，退一步說，縱有非買不可的物品，但日本民衆依賴黑巿的程度，也決不像上海這樣厲害，所以日本黑巿物價無論如何高，大多數民衆的生活，也不成問題。假如上海提高戶口米的配給量，而使民衆可以勉强依賴戶口米維持生活的時候，則黑巿米縱令由一石四千元昇到一萬元，也決不會再成爲物價問題。假如煤球配給量足够一家煮飯燒菜用，則煤球縱令一個一百元，也不會成為什麽嚴重問題。在黑巿裏追逐必要生活以外的物資，這是有錢人的私事，而對於民衆是無關痛養的</p>
<p>上海所以發生物價問題，是因為配給民衆的生活必需品量過省，而民衆對於大部份生活必需品不得不求之於黑巿；另外是由於平價巿塲因「統制」而陷於有行無巿的畸形狀態，所以黑巿價格便成為天文學上的數字。這正如一個獵人想捕捉砂漠的野獸，而把一切水源消滅，只留下一個水源一樣。縱令野獸很淸楚，接近水源有莫大的危險，然而為了生存，則不能不接近這一水源。生活必需品巿塲旣受到統制，而靠規定配給量又不能維持生活，處在這樣進退維谷情形下的上海巿民，如不像砂漠中野獸一樣，求生活必需品於僅僅剩下的一個水源「黑巿」——價格無如何高——裏，豈不是將坐以待斃麽？於是巿民只好讓囤積居奇的「黑巿」操縱者，任意擺佈，供其犧牲。由此觀之，「統制」和「黑巿」在主觀上雖然是對立物，然而在客觀上却是相互依存物。這一點表現得最具體而明顯者，莫如米。假如上海沒有黑巿米，而專靠現在的戶口米來維持生活，恐怕上海人口的大半，早已成為溝壑中的餓殍了，在這一點上「黑市」幫助「統制」。反過來脫，上海假如米不「統制」，則米就沒有「黑巿」，在這一點上，「統制」則幫助「黑巿」。明知故犯利用這種關係者，就是后大椿一派狐羣狗黨。這一事件正好像獵人爲捕捉野獸，而只利用一個水源一樣，運用「統制」與「黑市」問的無窮奧妙，而陷民衆於水火。</p>
<p>后大椿事件單在當事者明知故犯這一點上，就可以瞭如指掌地看出「統制」與「黑市」間的奧妙關係。與此正相反，奉戴德高望重如袁股登先生者流爲主持人的「統制」，其現狀無論怎樣有利於「黑市」操縱者，但二者相互依存的關係，就頗爲不易捉摸。然而在這種條件上，單就「統制」幫助「黑市」這一點說，在客觀上是與后大椿事件無大差別的。關於「就制」與「黑市」間的關係，三月十六日申報評言中說過：「沒有秩序與紀律是統帛經濟的第一缺陷，因爲少數人利用職權，營私舞弊，不惜使大多數人的全活，陷於日暮途窮之境；同時，米的黑市，布的黑市，以至一切日常用品的黑市，猖獗凌亂得不可收拾」。實際情形的確這樣，然而單純這樣說是不够的，是很有可能把二者的根本關係混淆了。按現在的配給量，縱令統制經濟具有秩序和紀律，縱令少數人不利用職權，而上海市民也不能不在黑市中購買生活必需品。上海的物價問題核心，應該就在這一點上。</p>
<p>我會不止一次地論列過，物價問題的解决方法，就是取締投機，肅正官紀，廉潔政治等等。自然，這幾點在某種程度上是買防物價上騰的手段，然而我從未認爲那就是物價問題的根木解决方法。因爲物價縱令極廉，而民衆的購買力假如比物價還低的話，則物價問題仍然還是存在的。固然，平價政策很重要，然而這不過是採用根本解決方法前的一時構宜治標方法而巳，不過是實行解剖手術前的樟腦注射而已。今日中國的經濟，早已不是用樟腦注射和退熱藥來敷衍了事的時期了，假如想根本解決中國的物價問題，則必須解剖「黑市」與「統制」間的關係。假如政府始終想以「統制」來解決物價問題，則必須澈底實行統制，即必須保證民衆的最低限度生活。民衆最低限度的生活得以保證後，物價問題方能根本解決。</p>
<p>今日蔣介石所苦惱中的物價問題，假如能在和平區內加以順利的解決，這就是和平區的政治勝利。和平區如取得不到政治勝利，則沒有資格談大東亞戰爭的「勝利第一」。於是可以知道，物價問題的核心，同時也就是政治問題的核心。（魯譯）</p>
<h3 id="c2">梯迭姆溪谷地帶日軍繼續前進中　佔領前衛陣地格納特匹克 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電據緬甸日軍前綫某基地電，英印第十七師遭日軍包圍後，即壓受日軍之猛烈攻擊，至七日終於陷於崩潰狀態。梯迭姆附近之敵主力第六十三，第六十八旅兩旅長及師長雷西同其部屬，企圖逃出日軍包圍等遁入印度領土內，於梯迭姆西北方馬尼布爾可之下流求其退路，但日單情銳迅速趕到，於頓扎恩地區梯迭姆西方發可點附近，日軍諸部隊在空軍協力下。與印度國民軍現正猛攻中，英印等十七師之殲滅戰，已達最高潮矣。</p>
<p>仰光十八日中央社電敵軍十七師據點梯迭姆之前衛陣地格納特匹克終巳陷落。該地敵軍自經日軍由東·南·北三路予以包圍及遵受猛攻以來，遂失去戰意，然因後方苛烈之督戰，故不得巳仍繼續抗戰，直至十七日晨四時，由於日軍從正面猛攻之結果，卒全部崩陷，紛紛爭先敗走。同時追擊敗敵，日軍遂開始進攻梯迭姆，故日軍去年十一月佔領福特瓦脫以來、阻止日軍前進之琴丘嶺地帶之唯一要術，業落於日軍之手。因此敵軍根據地梯迭姆上陷落，已迫於眉睫。</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令部，十七日發表公報稱：日軍刻正於梯迭姆北方及加飽溪谷地帶繼續前進。</p>

<p>東京十八日中央社電緬甸日眾前錢某基地電，緬甸方面日陸軍機隊，曾大舉轟炸敵軍西爾其亞東印度阿蔭密州兩飛行場。使其進攻緬甸唯一之前進基地遭受重創，其滑走路及重要設施皆被炸起火，日機於完成任務後，全部安返原防。是日另一隊日戰鬥機則由某某基地出發，途中於阿拉坎山上空擊落敵戰鬥機森炸機二架。復繼續前進，飛抵西爾其亞上空，與敵戰鬥機約三十架展開猛烈空戰，擊落其十九架（其中五架未證實），是役日方除一機自炸外，並無損害。</p>

<p>東京十八日中央社電　日政府以婦女乃增强軍需生產時重要之担當者，前爲確立女子勤勞總動員體制，會於去歲九月在次官會議即决定總動員促進案，邇後即進行組織女子動勞挺身隊事宜，繼於本年一月十八日之閣議中，通過緊急國民勤勞動員方策要綱。爲改善女子挺身隊制度，决就組　管理及隊員之規律待遇等方面，講求快的措置，前此日閣議中通過之决戰非常措置要綱內，亦有強制女子加入挺身隊之規定，央積極加強婦女動員體制。本月十八日通過之挺身隊制度張化方策要綱，己於是日下午由日情報局發表，茲錄主要內容如次：　女子挺身隊乃應國家之緊急要求，本諸減私奉公精神從事增產者，故其身分於原則上，自與一般勤勞者根木不同，然於工作時應使之與其他勤勞者具同樣之勤勞精神，從事作業。　以十二歲之未婚女子爲隊員，戰時女子農業耍員除外，以地方長官或國民勤勞動員署長爲中心，使校長女子靑年團長，婦人會長及團內會長，分團內會長分別組織挺身隊，備　於生產方面。　各女子挺身隊，由可代替隊員父兄母姊等近親者之統率者統率之，於其下設隊長，俾期於運用上萬無遺憾，將隊員配置於勤勞管理優長之工廠，盡量使之以上班形式工作，不可能時，則於設備完善之宿舍中，或已化爲工廠之學校及家庭等共同工作地點、從事作業。　女子挺身隊員之從業期間爲一年，於開始工作前，盡量予以預備訓練。　女子挺身隊動員之業務，於原則上由地方長官執行，其一部業務，由國民勞務動員署長分別掌管，使市區町村長輔佐之，　女子挺身隊經指導勸解於結成後、實行配置。此次在於組織加入及待遇等基本事項：即根據國家總動員法第五條之協力命，公布勒令，實行强力之法的運用，對於不服該協力命令者於必要時，即根據該法第六條，發動就　命令，強制配置。</p>
<h3 id="c5">緬甸村民生擒美機員 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日軍授予獎狀</p>
<p>東京十八日中央社電緬甸日軍前錢某基地電，緬甸民衆對日軍協力之熟誠日益增加，日前某村發現美空軍駕駛員跳傘圖逃，常經村長及村民一致之協力，遂將彼等生擒，茲日方爲感謝及獎勵起見，於十五日由緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊某部隊長將獎狀授與該等有功村民，美機來襲時，其中有P38型機四架被日機擊落之際，美駕駛員圖跳傘降下逃走時，被南繹州某村長發現，遂立刻呼集村民，奮勇將潛伏於森林中之美將校一名逮捕，而送交日軍。</p>
<h3 id="c6">戰事期間　渝生產狀况　兩種意見絕對相反 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>中央社訊、關於渝方戰時工業生產狀况，綜合最近所得情報，計有絕對相反之二種見解，雙方互相攻擊甚烈。蓋一方稱渝方治下之工業生產力，較事變前大見發展，並繼列龐大數字，極表樂觀。而他方則稱現下之工業界，正遭遇極重大事態，故政府應從速寶施強力之工業對策云云。據最近渝方大公報登載，國民黨中央宣傳部參事張平羣，曾於最近在招待外人記者團席上，就渝方戰時工業之發展狀况，表示戰時渝方之後方工業，較事變前有飛躍之進展，同時重慶中央日報，亦於三月六日，在評論　論及此事，表示渝方工業之發展，尙距離甚遠，雙方之主張，完全相反、其要旨如次：自抗戰以來，渝方之鋼鐵工業及機械工業，在技術上確有進步，其業務在民國三十年以前，亦甚爲繁盛。然其後因勞工資資增加，並原料昻騰，致工業資金之周轉，日見困難。同時因新事業之停頓，及其他種種原因，銷路大見狹窄。結果大部份工廠，均陷於停工或減少生產狀熊。據資源委員會當局說明，資源委員會所屬之鋼鐵工廠計有九所　其中最大者為該委員會與兵工署所合辦之鋼鐵廠，設備及技術之最新式者爲電化冶煉廠、在其管轄下者尙有電氣。雷柱廠。純鐵廠。電　鋼廠·手　鋼廠等，目下正積極籌備，最近即可聞工，將來擬利用高周波電氣爐，製造各種合金礦，或採用低溫悚　法、鑄煉純鐵。此雖爲渝方最初之優秀事業，然各廠生產量並無一廠一日可超過三十噸者。且因國營資金　少，周轉不甚效滑，致出品之銷路、頗爲不良，因此該委員會之資和鋼鐵廠。已於半年前停頓。四川省內十八家工廠中，已有十家停工，政府之工業借款，杯水車薪，對於實際，絕無若何裨益云。父渝經濟部長翁文　，及經濟評論家千家駒，亦均抱有與以上社論大致同樣之見解。千家駒在其最後結論，主張現下之工業建設部面，因生產資金並原料之不足，及物價昻騰等種種障碍、遭遇十分困難之事態，故應採取強硬政策，以資適應此種情勢云。</p>
<h3 id="c7">黃金美元騰貴　渝物價暴漲 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>廣州十八日中央社電　最近渝方自美國輸入大量黃金二億零元，圖以之為通貨膨脹對策。又因對駐渝美國職員支給美元，致使美元汜　，渝方物價凶之愈形昇　，渝方大公報頃以「黃金美元及物價」爲題，坦白指出黃金美元與物價之因果關係，茲誌其大意如次：近月來，黃金與美元之價格暴騰不已，物價已較舊日漲達三成至五成之多。物價質金與美元相互刺激，就美元而言，現在法幣與美元之公定價格，僅合戰前之六倍，暗市最高之昆明，則已達戰前之五六十倍。渝法幣於國內購買力之低落，至二百五十與一之現象。過去美元不能暴漲，乃因內地之美兀較少，匯兌亦爲政府機關與特殊人物等封鎖，故法幣之匯兌價値，與國內價値無何聯繫。然近年來因美軍來往頻繁，且自本年一月起，美外交官等之薪金，完全支給美金，故美元流入甚多。又渝方與印度間之空輸亦極頻繁，商人乃處行收買，匯兌之公定率與黑市交易已達十倍以上。美元如此日趨騰貴，美元之黑巿亦愈猖厥，黃金與美元之飛騰，刺激物價、物價復影響黃金與美元，物價因受此三者惡循環之影響，乃繼續暴漲，若仍如此置之不顧，不知將形成如何狀態。吾等切望政府當局，與其採用姑息不對症療法，不如講求根本對策。</p>

<p>恭敬是日本人的美德，熱情是日本人固有的優性格。即看一下謠曲，鉢之木一，也可以知道日本人內心裏，蘊着如何　的熱情烈火，然而　種熱情，至現代逐漸喪失，尤其至戰時的今天。</p>
<p>府當局，聲嘶力竭地吶喊熱情之軍要，提倡恢復，然而反響的效果微弱偶爾社會上發現熱情事件，則新聞報紙，立刻大書而特書發表出來。就根據這一點，我們可以知道日本非常　乏熱情，我們日本一萬萬同胞，在今天　　吃緊的關頭，應當捫心自問，當此以往以麼？</p>
<p>為完成大東亞戰爭的　的，英勇犧牲，雖然最為重要，然而必須要知道，涵養這　熱情更為重要。戰爭，也能用這種熱情來完成　。戰爭的效果，也能用這種熱情來把握得到，培植和擴大起來。古人所說的仁者無敵，就是證明熱情在人類大小事中所佔的要位置，我們必須領會這一點。</p>
<p>關於缺乏熱情的原因，所謂個人主義作崇最大。無論怎樣損人，只要利己就可以，當這種思想支配人類的時候，熱情就會不知不覺地銷形匿跡於人間。英美節制個人主義，雖然無能　力，但總有基督教　之撑腰，日本則無節制　，只是一味地　行個人主義，所以　弊遠超　英美　倍。也許有人認為這是過去的事實，而面在早已大改乎其觀，事實上這種思想是　現實　十萬八千里的，而現在更乘戰爭時期，易於混水撈魚，無熱情現　，　益化為家常便飯，熱情反而成為少見多怪的例外。因戰爭　人工不足，這是當然的事。然而對於這　不足，不僅不想補救之道，反而乘人工不足機會，作出五花八門的無熱情行動，且處之泰然，亳　介意，這不能不說是乘戰爭機會作罪惡之事者。</p>
<p>假如人與人聞有熱情，相互聞的摩擦與傾軋，十之七八就會消浙於無形。有一個人對我說：</p>
<p>一以前因事到某一官廳去，一個年青的官吏坐在動轉椅子上，兩脚穿着鞋子上，對於來者毫不禮遇。不僅完全不以同輩來招呼，而且幾乎不當人來看待，眞是令人髮指，憤慨萬分。這或許是一個例外。這樣的官吏，决不會作事的。然而决不要忘記，在社會中是有這類情形的，我們决不是說，只有現在的官廳可以稱作無熱情的機關。無熟情的現象，業巳普遍到窮鄕　壞的任何角落了。如果不澈底滌除這十風氣，日本則决不會在世界上成為一個大國，日本國民則决不會担負起領導大東亞的大國民任務。</p>
<p>熱情，不僅是對人的，而且也是對物的。、就是釘一個釘子，黏一個信封，剪一張紙，有熱情與無熱情之間，是有很大區別的。在今日，包裹的外皮差不多沒有一件是完整無缺的了。這究竟是寄出者的罪過呢，抑還是管理者的罪過呢？總而言之，這是某處無熱情所表現的結果。尤有甚者，乘包裹的破壞，盜取其中物件者，也大不乏例。為盜取內部物件而加以破壞，這或許不能一槪而論，但說絕對沒有這樣事，我也不相信。近來報紙上旣然常常發表這樣累犯者的起訴事件，當然這是證明我們日本業已有很多的這樣不良現象了。</p>
<p>在社會上認為這是一件小事還是默爾不言的好，或者有的人怕麻煩，且具有「各掃　前雪」的思想，於是大家都不關心這種不熱情的態度，　不良現象的產生，普普遍行了。我想家家廚房裏不必說，就是規模宏大的軍需公司之類的機關裏，由於缺乏所謂熱情，一定有很多浪費的。按報紙的報道，單純電力一項，也可以節省數萬瓦特。東京有一家權威報紙的社長，親自監督印刷部的工作，據說因此而得以儉省一萬日金的破舊紙。這類的實例，到處都有，假如一萬萬人民，無論是關於物也好，對於人也好，對於自己也好，對於他人也了，都養成一種熱情，則其收　，實不可以道里計。</p>
<p>前此社會上有人常常攻擊電車或火東上不讓給兒童及病人座位者，追源溯始，這畢竟是由他的大人或長輩學來的。自已無熱情，反而要求其他少年或靑年熱情，眞是一件本末倒置的事。假如耍求他人熱情，而自己必須以身作則這才是正規。</p>
<p>在社會裏常提到責任觀念，然而責任觀念决不是從天上吊下來的。責任觀念是和熱情互為因果的。如熱情超越責任觀念後，則縱非自己責任內的事情，也會　責任心加諸這件事上。於是人事則愈加圓滑，社會上的事情，就無往而不利。單純拘泥於責任心，而無熱情的時候，則正如企圖轉動機械而無潤滑油一樣，是不能順利渾行的。熱情就是使一切關係靈活化的潤滑油。原來這種潤滑油在我們日本人當中是非常多的。而現在竟自丟失，誠是一件極大的憾事。迅速恢復起來，加以發揮光大。</p>
<p>今日很多人的心都冷酷了，因而聲音也冷酷了：如一看面孔，好像是準備吵架一樣的神情，其自圓其說的話柄即是因戰時緊張的心境，實在無法更改。這種神情，在戰時是最有害的，所以無論如何都要　改。進行今日這樣規模偉大的戰爭，以這種哭喪　來應付，反而壞事的。古人所說的談笑於生死之　，此之謂也，相互閒分吃一個橘子，兩個人分喝半杯酒，相互間通有無，補長短，這才能流露出來眞正的人間味。在今天，因戰爭而就從早到晚，板出　喪門神般面孔，是不會有細心作事的。如果我們想到，為了我們三千年來的祖先，為了我們幾千年後的子孫，對於這個千戰難逢的神聖戰爭，自己縱　渺小，是一萬萬同胞中的一份子，但要各盡功能，所以應該忍受　何貧困痛苦，而欣然甘心赴湯蹈火。所謂視死如歸，就是這個這理。乘此機會，我要講句痛快話即在我們前方第一綫將士及其關係者間，流行着一種遠勝謠曲「鉢之木」一　的熱情。最近一位視察壯烈萬分的拉巴爾及其他方面的戰塲歸來者說，陸海軍間完全打成一片不必說，即任何一個將士，都忘記死神迫近眉睫，高舉的互相合作，快樂地共享痛苦。我聽到了這種渾然一體，上下和睦的情形，於是情不自禁，興奮的熱淚迸流了。這樣才有資格稱作是日本人。我希望，我們大後方的同胞，也要倣傚前方第一綫上的將士，恢復天眞爛漫，純潔熱情的日本人吧。（未完）（魯譯自二十日每日新聞）</p>

<p>（乙）日本社會設施及槪祝（忠　第二小學校長孫　滄　）：　關於日本新聞事業之槪况，日本新聞事業規模宏大，對報導出版以及其他各方設備，迅速完備，全體新聞從業員，均在新聞報國之目標下　進。此外對　內商人使利　，亦出版　人　　之報紙。故日本文化　　如何，亦可瞭如指掌。　工廠及社會，日本化學工業之發達，不亞於歐美，關於各廠之設備，均有福利設施，如工廠中設立學校，病院，體育，公買處等，全為工廠從業員之保障生活着想，與歐美人抱取榨取主義及自私自利之目標不同，　日本國內之工廠，所有生產，全部獻納於國家所有，而工廠從業員，亦為國家努力生產。</p>
<p>交通教育</p>
<p>（丙）通　關之概况（忠心第三小學校長孫壬林講）：日本國內交通機構完備，國內民衆莫不稱便，如地下鐵道，海底隧道，　氣火車，高架鐵道，登山電車，纜車，郊外電車等等，均頗發達，不但迅速準確，且安全便利。同時　內民衆對交通秩序，頗為遵守，絕不混雜爭先，（丁）日木敎育感想（忠心第五小學校長張仲義　）：日本國內國民學校林立，均為義務制度，設備完全，每校均設廣大操塲，大體堂。中學方面，男女絕不問學，在女子中學特　家庭科，灌輸家庭一切常識，教授烹飪，洗衣，縫紉，插花，　茶等各項工作。大學專門學校之設備。可稱與社界無比，在內求學學生，儉樸異常，此外並有訓練各種殘廢不全之民衆所設之學校。總之日本各學校，敎育方針，均採取精神敎育與勤勞敎育為主要。</p>
<p>國民精神</p>
<p>（戊）日本國民精神，（忠信中學校長蔡福澄所講）：首以日本家庭而言，日本民衆毎一家庭，無論男女老幼，均以家長為中心，竭盡本分，即如一家主婦在活動情形，全力主政於家庭上，即右閑必研究　作，敬茶，插花等工作，為必須之修養，且尤着重於家庭敎育，指導兒女。同時對於子女受中等敎育時，尤為　愼，比　每一家庭，均設主神位，每日　拜，　勉勵兒女發揚祖光之精神。關於每一日本人民，將身體完全實　於國家所有，於此足見民衆愛國之熱忱。至日本　內之生活安定，物資資配給完善，以及人民惜物愼用之精神，可居世界之冠，是以深感日本政治力量之巨大，國民對政府之堅定信，上下一致同心一協力，莫不為完遂東亞戰爭而努力。</p>

<p>中央社訊　市宣傳處於昨日在市府召開第十次記者例會，茲將各報記者提出問題，及各機關解答事項分誌如下：</p>
<p>配給煤球質劣</p>
<p>中華日報間：第三期配給之煤球，煤屑內　泥土太多，無法燃燒，關於用戶之配給煤球成份，早經確　規定，而煤廠出品，如此惡劣，當局對　有無適當改善辦法？一區公署經濟處答：配給煤球之成份、本處早經確實規定，惟各廠商間或有建法行為，現正派人四出調查及督製，深望市民隨時檢舉報告本處，俾便依法　辦。</p>
<p>賭塲决不延期</p>
<p>新中國報問：關於本市賭塲於三月底禁絕之說外聞　有延期謠傳，此項消息是否可靠？當局究採如何措置，或已有决定之方針？秘書處答：外間所傳種種，均屬不確，本府旣已限令各賭塲於三月二十九日停閉，决不延期</p>
<p>燈火管制警備</p>
<p>中華日報問：本市實施永久燈火管制，於無月色之黑夜，　小難免乘機活動，請問警務及保甲當局之適密防範方法如何？第一警察局警備科長答：一·自三月三日實施燈火管制時，即已訓令各分局長對於不良份子之策動，應密切防範。二·强化夜問警備，並加派巡察及外勤監督。三·增强保甲自警團興警察間之密切聯絡。四·隨時檢查市民證。五·與各有關軍憲機關，密切聯絡。六·警察當局决盡力維持治安，希市民協力。又第一警察局防空科長答：電證公司對於外燈改迭正在積極改善，最近期內必能使光綫較月前明亮，故治安一定亦可同時獲得佳果。</p>

<h3 id="c38">長期防空以後 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>本市自從實行長期燈火管制以，業已半月，在實施之初，我們曾略作建議，惟半月之間，流弊時有所聞，尤以不　份子，乘　跳梁，至堪痛恨。對此、現實問題防空及警務當局自應嚴切注視，迅籌防止與消滅之方。</p>
<p>第一，　小乘機活動，完全利用黑暗摸索，尤以偏僻馬路為甚。我們前曾主張月色皎明期間可以不使用燈光。但平時燈光應普遍使用如以南京路燈光為標準，則其他馬路應一律如此，以減少宵小利用黑暗之機會。</p>
<p>第二，直截爽快，規　夜間十一時以後，路人不准通行，如有通行必耍者，准領通行證。但市民臨時因緊急事故而通行者，發給通行證手續應力求簡單。娛樂塲所營業時間應提早結束，如黃金大戲院將改為八時半結束之例。其實，這種措置，無論在節約電力，　錢戰時生活等觀點而言，都是必耍而早應實行了。</p>
<p>最後，希望市民大衆晚間無事少出門，免却許多麻煩。同時，對於燈光外洩一點，也應特別注意，與其說遵從當局的防空命令，不如說訓練自己的習慣。</p>

<p>— 雪恬</p>
<p>近讀報載，前蘇省糧食局長后大椿，　食部水產管理局長，兼建設部郵政儲金匯業局局長胡政，因於作戰期間，採辦軍糧，有重大舞弊情事一案，自經國府明　　職，交特別法庭審訊後，業經審訊終結，該兩犯均供認不諱，業經判處死刑。聞此案由蘇州盟邦憲兵部檢舉，而得置於法，一般民衆讀了此則新聞，人心大快，一國人皆曰可殺」者，其斯之謂乎，</p>
<p>夫后胡輩，藉着政府勢力，作此營私舞弊勾當，以造成現今物價飛　，民食維艱之時代。今后胡雖已置於法，但其他如后胡輩之貪官污吏者，諒不乏人，安得盡如蘇州盟邦憲兵部之能不顧情面，一一檢舉，而盡置於法焉。</p>
<p>又推而進之，而盡置事變發生後，一般所謂發「國難財」者，動亂數萬、甚而至於數千萬者，比比皆是。此輩「暴發戶」，莫不籍　非法手段，博取錢財，按理亦當加以檢舉而洽以應得之咎。深望國府以次處罰貪官事件，為造成廉潔政治之起點，實施戰時物價對策開始，一面獎勵檢舉或告發著，得有實據，尤須不　情面，依法嚴懲。則民衆幸甚！國家幸甚！</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Core of the Commodity Price Problem <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>To think the commodity price problem arises because prices are high is a nonsensical view. Those who hold this view do so based on the proportion between the amount of goods and currency to observe the commodity price problem, and arrive at a guess. However, this is the most foolish opinion in the world. For example, a one-carat diamond may be worth 100,000 or 200,000 yuan, but this can never become a commodity price problem. The Soviet Union imposes extremely heavy taxes on luxury goods, so the prices of luxury goods are far higher than in other countries. Currently, some black market items in Japan are even more expensive than in Shanghai. However, neither Japan nor the Soviet Union has ever experienced a commodity price problem like Shanghai's. In short, the commodity price problem does not arise because prices are high, but because there is a social system where people have to buy high-priced goods. Although black market prices in Japan are not necessarily cheap, because truly essential daily necessities can be obtained through extremely inexpensive rations, the people will not be affected in their survival, even if they completely ignore the high-priced black market. Stepping back, even if there are items that must be bought, the extent to which the Japanese people rely on the black market is not as severe as in Shanghai. Therefore, no matter how high black market prices are in Japan, the lives of most people are not problematic. If Shanghai increased the ration of household rice and allowed people to barely maintain their lives with it, then even if black market rice rose from 4,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry volume), it would no longer be a commodity price problem. If the coal briquette ration was sufficient for a family to cook and prepare dishes, then even if one coal briquette cost 100 yuan, it would not become a serious problem. Pursuing materials outside of essential daily necessities on the black market is the private affair of the wealthy and is of no concern to the general public.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai is experiencing a commodity price problem is that the amount of essential daily necessities rationed to the people is too low, and the people have to seek most of their essential daily necessities on the black market. Additionally, the flat-price markets have fallen into an abnormal state of existence in name only due to "control," so black market prices have become astronomical figures. This is like a hunter wanting to capture beasts in the desert and eliminating all water sources except for one. Even if the beasts are very clear that approaching the water source is extremely dangerous, they cannot but approach this water source for survival. Since the market for essential daily necessities is controlled, and life cannot be sustained by the regulated rations, the citizens of Shanghai, in this dilemma, must seek essential daily necessities from the only remaining water source, the "black market"—regardless of how high the price—like beasts in the desert, or they will simply sit and wait for death. Therefore, the citizens have no choice but to let the "black market" manipulators, who hoard and speculate, arbitrarily control them and sacrifice them. From this perspective, although "control" and the "black market" are opposing in a subjective sense, they are mutually dependent in an objective sense. The most concrete and obvious manifestation of this point is rice. If Shanghai did not have black market rice and relied solely on the current household rice to maintain life, I am afraid that the majority of Shanghai's population would have already become starving corpses in ditches. In this respect, the "black market" helps "control." Conversely, if rice in Shanghai were not "controlled," then there would be no "black market" for rice. In this respect, "control" helps the "black market." Those who knowingly exploit this relationship are Hou Dachun and his cronies. This event is just like a hunter using only one water source to capture beasts, employing the endless mysteries between "control" and the "black market" to plunge the people into misery.</p>
<p>The Hou Dachun incident alone, in that the parties involved knowingly violated the law, clearly shows the subtle relationship between "control" and the "black market." In contrast, for those who hold esteemed figures like Mr. Yuan Gengdeng as the host of "control," no matter how beneficial the current situation is to "black market" manipulators, the mutually dependent relationship between the two is quite difficult to grasp. However, under these conditions, simply saying that "control" helps the "black market," objectively, is not much different from the Hou Dachun incident. Regarding the relationship between "control" and the "black market," the Shen Bao commentary on March 16 stated: "The first defect of controlled economy is the lack of order and discipline, because a small number of people use their power to seek personal gain and engage in corruption, not hesitating to plunge the livelihood of the majority into a desperate situation; at the same time, the black market for rice, the black market for cloth, and even the black market for all daily necessities, are rampant and chaotic beyond control." The actual situation is indeed like this, but simply saying this is not enough, and there is a high possibility of confusing the fundamental relationship between the two. According to the current rations, even if the controlled economy has order and discipline, even if a small number of people do not use their power, the citizens of Shanghai cannot but buy essential daily necessities in the black market. The core of Shanghai's commodity price problem should lie in this point.</p>
<p>I have discussed more than once that the solutions to the commodity price problem are to crack down on speculation, rectify official discipline, and have clean government, etc. Naturally, these points are, to some extent, measures to prevent commodity prices from rising, but I have never considered them to be the fundamental solution to the commodity price problem. Because even if commodity prices are extremely cheap, if the people's purchasing power is lower than the commodity prices, then the commodity price problem still exists. Of course, the flat-price policy is very important, but it is only a temporary and expedient palliative measure before adopting a fundamental solution, only a camphor injection before performing surgery. Today, China's economy is no longer in a period where it can be perfunctorily dealt with using camphor injections and antipyretics. If we want to fundamentally solve China's commodity price problem, we must dissect the relationship between the "black market" and "control." If the government consistently wants to solve the commodity price problem through "control," then it must thoroughly implement control, that is, it must guarantee the minimum living standards of the people. Only after the minimum living standards of the people are guaranteed can the commodity price problem be fundamentally solved.</p>
<p>If the commodity price problem that Chiang Kai-shek is troubled by today can be successfully resolved within the Peaceful Zone, this will be the political victory of the Peaceful Zone. If the Peaceful Zone cannot achieve political victory, then it is not qualified to talk about "victory first" in the Greater East Asia War. Thus, it can be known that the core of the commodity price problem is also the core of the political problem. (Translated by Lu)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Continue to Advance in the Tiddim Valley Area, Occupying the Forward Position of Kangrat Peak <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base on the front lines of the Japanese army in Burma, the British Indian 17th Division, after being surrounded by the Japanese army, was subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army, and finally collapsed on the 7th. The commanders of the 63rd and 68th Brigades, the main force near Tiddim, and division commander Lacey, along with their subordinates, attempted to escape the Japanese encirclement and flee into Indian territory, seeking their retreat downstream of Manipur, northwest of Tiddim. However, the Japanese forces arrived quickly, and near the junction of Tonzang area in western Tiddim, the Japanese troops, with the cooperation of the air force, are currently fiercely attacking the Indian National Army. The annihilation battle of the British Indian 17th Division has reached its climax.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The forward position of Kangrat Peak, the stronghold of the enemy's 17th Division in Tiddim, has finally fallen. The enemy troops in that area, after being surrounded by the Japanese army from the east, south, and north, and subjected to fierce attacks, lost their will to fight. However, due to the severe supervision from the rear, they were forced to continue fighting until 4:00 a.m. on the 17th, when the Japanese army launched a fierce frontal attack, resulting in a complete collapse and a scramble to flee. At the same time, in pursuit of the defeated enemy, the Japanese army began to attack Tiddim. Therefore, the only key technique in the Chin Hills area, which has prevented the Japanese army from advancing since the Japanese army occupied Fort White in November last year, has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. As a result, the enemy's base camp, Tiddim, is on the verge of falling.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Southeast Asia Allied Headquarters issued a communiqué on the 17th stating that Japanese troops are currently continuing to advance north of Tiddim and in the Kabaw Valley area.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Aircraft Heavily Bomb Two Airfields in Indian Territory <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army in Burma states that the Japanese army air squadrons in Burma heavily bombed the enemy's Sirkya and East Indian Ayingmi airfields. This severely damaged their only forward base for attacking Burma. The runways and important facilities were set on fire by the bombing. After completing their mission, all Japanese aircraft safely returned to their original defenses. On the same day, another squadron of Japanese fighter planes departed from a certain base. On the way, they shot down two enemy fighter-bombers over the Arakan Mountains. They then continued to advance, flew over Sirkya, and engaged in a fierce aerial battle with about 30 enemy fighter planes, shooting down 19 of them (five of which were unconfirmed). In this battle, the Japanese side suffered no damage except for one plane that self-destructed.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japan Actively Strengthens Women's Mobilization System, Information Bureau Releases Policy Outline <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government believes that women are important contributors to increasing military production. In order to establish a system for the general mobilization of women's labor, the Cabinet decided on a plan to promote general mobilization in September of last year at a meeting of vice ministers. Since then, preparations have been made to organize women's labor volunteer corps. Subsequently, on January 18 of this year, the Cabinet approved the outline of emergency national labor mobilization policies. In order to improve the women's volunteer corps system, measures will be taken to address the organization, management, and regulations and treatment of corps members. The outline of emergency measures for the decisive battle, which was passed by the Cabinet previously, also includes provisions for compulsory female participation in the volunteer corps. The central government is actively strengthening the women's mobilization system. The outline of policies for strengthening the volunteer corps system, which was passed on the 18th of this month, was released by the Japanese Information Bureau on the afternoon of this day. The main content is recorded as follows: The women's volunteer corps should respond to the urgent demands of the country and engage in increased production with a spirit of selflessness and dedication to public service. Therefore, in principle, their status is fundamentally different from that of general laborers. However, when working, they should engage in operations with the same labor spirit as other laborers. Unmarried women aged 12 and above are to be members of the corps, with the exception of female agricultural members during wartime. Local officials or the head of the National Labor Mobilization Office will take the lead in having school principals, heads of women's youth groups, heads of women's associations, and heads of group associations organize volunteer corps to prepare for production. Each women's volunteer corps will be led by a leader who can replace the corps member's fathers, brothers, mothers, sisters, or other close relatives. Under them, there will be a captain, in order to ensure that there are no regrets in operations. The corps members will be assigned to factories with excellent labor management and will work in the form of shifts as much as possible. When this is not possible, they will work together in well-equipped dormitories or in schools and homes that have been converted into factories. The term of service for women's volunteer corps members is one year. Preparatory training will be given as much as possible before starting work. In principle, the mobilization of women's volunteer corps will be carried out by local officials. A portion of the work will be managed separately by the head of the National Labor Mobilization Office, with the assistance of municipal, ward, town, and village chiefs. After guidance and persuasion, women's volunteer corps will be formed and deployed. This time, in terms of basic matters such as organization, participation, and treatment, the cooperation order in Article 5 of the National General Mobilization Law will be announced and enforced, and forceful legal measures will be implemented. For those who do not comply with the cooperation order, if necessary, the employment order will be issued in accordance with Article 6 of the law to enforce deployment.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Burmese Villagers Capture American Airmen Alive, Japanese Army Awards Certificates <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain front-line base of the Japanese army in Burma states that the Burmese people's cooperation with the Japanese army is increasing daily. Recently, a certain village discovered that American Air Force pilots had parachuted to escape. Through the concerted cooperation of the village chief and villagers, they were captured alive. In order to express gratitude and encouragement, the commander of a certain unit of the Japanese Army Air Force in Burma awarded certificates to these meritorious villagers on the 15th. When four P38 aircraft were shot down by Japanese aircraft during an attack by American aircraft, the American pilots attempted to parachute down and escape. The village chief of a certain village in Southern Yi Prefecture discovered this and immediately gathered the villagers to bravely arrest an American officer who was lurking in the forest and hand him over to the Japanese army.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Wartime Production Situation in Chongqing: Two Completely Opposing Opinions <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Regarding the wartime industrial production situation in Chongqing, based on recently obtained information, there are two completely opposing views, and the two sides are fiercely attacking each other. One side claims that the industrial production capacity under Chongqing's rule has greatly developed compared to before the incident, and continues to list huge figures, expressing extreme optimism. The other side claims that the industrial sector is currently encountering extremely major events, so the government should promptly implement strong industrial countermeasures. According to a recent report in Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor in the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, recently stated at a reception for foreign reporters that the rear area industry in Chongqing has made leaps and bounds compared to before the incident. At the same time, the Chongqing Central Daily News also commented on this matter on March 6, stating that the development of Chongqing's industry is still far away. The arguments of both sides are completely contradictory. The main points are as follows: Since the War of Resistance, the steel and machinery industries in Chongqing have indeed made progress in technology, and their business was very prosperous before 1941. However, thereafter, due to increased labor costs and rising raw material prices, the turnover of industrial funds became increasingly difficult. At the same time, due to the stagnation of new projects and other reasons, sales channels have become greatly narrowed. As a result, most factories have been forced to shut down or reduce production. According to the authorities of the Resources Committee, there are nine steel factories under the Resources Committee, the largest of which is the steel factory jointly run by the committee and the Ordnance Department. The most modern equipment and technology are in the electric smelting factory. Under its jurisdiction are also electrical, thunderbolt, pure iron, electric steel, and hand steel factories, etc. Currently, preparations are being actively made and work will be heard soon. In the future, it is planned to use high-frequency electric furnaces to manufacture various alloy mines, or use low-temperature sintering methods to cast pure iron. Although this is Chongqing's first excellent undertaking, the production volume of each factory does not exceed 30 tons per day. Moreover, due to the lack of state-owned funds and inefficient turnover, the sales channels of the products are quite poor. Therefore, the Zihe Steel Factory of the committee has been shut down for half a year. Ten of the eighteen factories in Sichuan Province have been shut down. Government industrial loans are a drop in the bucket and have absolutely no benefit to reality. Father Yu, Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao, and economic commentator Qian Jiaju, also hold roughly the same views as the above editorial. Qian Jiaju, in his final conclusion, argued that the industrial construction department is currently facing very difficult situations due to insufficient production funds and raw materials, as well as various obstacles such as rising prices. Therefore, strong policies should be adopted to adapt to this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Gold and US Dollars Soar, Commodity Prices in Chongqing Skyrocket <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 18th (Central News Agency) - Recently, Chongqing imported a large amount of gold worth 200 million US dollars from the United States, intending to use it as a countermeasure against currency inflation. Also, because US dollars were issued to American personnel stationed in Chongqing, causing the US dollar to flood the market, commodity prices in Chongqing became even more soaring. Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao recently published an article titled "Gold, US Dollars, and Commodity Prices," frankly pointing out the causal relationship between gold, US dollars, and commodity prices. The gist of it is recorded as follows: In recent months, the prices of gold and US dollars have skyrocketed, and commodity prices have risen by 30% to 50% compared to the past. Commodity prices, gold, and US dollars stimulate each other. Regarding the US dollar, the official exchange rate between the current legal currency and the US dollar is only six times that of before the war, while the highest black market price in Kunming has reached fifty to sixty times that of before the war. The domestic purchasing power of Chongqing's legal currency has fallen to a ratio of 250 to 1. In the past, the US dollar could not skyrocket because there were fewer US dollars in the interior, and exchange was blocked by government agencies and special figures. Therefore, there was no connection between the exchange value of the legal currency and its domestic value. However, in recent years, due to the frequent coming and going of the US military, and since January of this year, the salaries of US diplomats and others have been paid entirely in US dollars, a large number of US dollars have flowed in. Also, air transport between Chongqing and India is extremely frequent, and merchants are buying and exchanging. The official exchange rate and black market transactions have reached more than ten times. As the US dollar becomes more expensive, the black market for US dollars becomes more rampant. The skyrocketing of gold and US dollars stimulates commodity prices, and commodity prices affect gold and US dollars. Commodity prices continue to soar under the influence of this vicious cycle of the three. If we continue to ignore this, I don't know what the situation will become. We sincerely hope that the government authorities, rather than adopting stopgap measures, should seek fundamental countermeasures.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 18th (Central News Agency) - According to The New York Times, US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz, after consulting with Roosevelt and other US military leaders on important matters, has returned to Pearl Harbor by air from Washington. When he met with leaders on the 16th, he warned the American people not to be too optimistic about the war against Japan. He emphasized the importance of submarine warfare as follows: The combat power and morale of the Japanese fleet are still strong. Japan has a strong air force in other places, preparing for battle. Submarines will still occupy an important position in the elements of combat in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Tokyo Utilizes Vacant Land to Increase Agricultural Production <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) - Based on the outline of emergency measures for the decisive battle, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government previously established a general headquarters for the utilization of vacant land. The headquarters observed that there are many vacant lands in schools, temples, and other places in the metropolis. If each family without farmland plants one vegetable, the annual increase in vegetables and miscellaneous grains can be 25 million koku (approximately 6.4 pounds per koku). Therefore, it is actively promoting this, and the results obtained so far are quite good. Currently, vacant lands in national schools and town council neighborhood groups have begun to be cultivated to increase production. The headquarters has decided to establish "vacant land utilization and production offices" in Hinoya, Shiba Hazawa, Ueno, Otsuka, Koen, Inokashira, and Azusa Mountain and other parks from the 20th of this month to guide this effort. The work of utilizing vacant land to increase production will temporarily utilize 202 large and small parks, converting both grasslands and plazas into agricultural gardens. In areas with poor soil quality, vegetables such as squash will be cultivated, which will yield approximately 70,000 hectares of arable land.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Government Determined to Severely Punish Corrupt Officials, Authorities Specifically Publish Opinions on Purifying Officialdom <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) - Since the occurrence of the Hou Hu military grain procurement corruption case, the government has severely punished the perpetrators, imposing the death penalty. The people across the country have deeply admired and unanimously supported the government's severe measures. In light of this, the reporter made a special visit to the government authorities to inquire about future opinions on punishing corruption and purifying officialdom. The response was as follows: "The government's promotion of clean governance and elimination of corruption has always been a guiding principle. Our esteemed leader has repeatedly given instructions on purifying officialdom in his speeches. In his talk at the beginning of this year, he specifically pointed out that eliminating corruption is the greatest policy direction of this year. In May and October of last year, the promulgation and implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Important Commodities and the Regulations for Punishing Crimes by Public Officials showed the authorities' determination. The thorough investigation and strict handling of this corruption case are the implementation of the leader's will and the execution of laws. In the future, the elimination of corruption will definitely be based on a consistent policy and strictly enforced. In the spirit of 'Better to cry in one family than to cry on the road,' any corrupt officials will be severely dealt with. We must achieve a situation of complete elimination of abuses in a short period of time. It is hoped that all levels of society will be self-disciplined and self-loving, cooperate in promoting this, and jointly build a model of clean governance."</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 18th - This time, the government authorities, in order to purify officialdom, eliminate corruption, and further seek to stabilize people's livelihoods and enhance combat power, decisively sentenced the main culprits in the military grain procurement corruption case, Hou Dachun and Hu Zheng, to death. As a result, the news spread, shocking both the government and the public. In particular, the general public was moved to the point of thoroughness and further strengthened their belief in the government's thoroughness and further enhanced their belief in the government. The Central News Agency reporter, for this reason, made a special visit yesterday to the highest administrative responsibility of the capital, the academy, and Li, the police commander and police chief, to inquire about their opinions on the government's measures. They respectively issued key talks: Mayor (Remarks) This time, the group government is making decisive disposal for clarifying the governance of officials and punishing corruption. If there are local officials who use their powers and engage in private fraud, or if there are illegal merchants who hoard and manipulate, disrupt the economy, and harm people's livelihood, they must be severely punished by law. Be prepared to make the local administration in the capital clean, people's livelihood stable, (Director Li's remarks) Since the launch of the Greater East Asia War, various major materials have been subject to reasonable control. However, the control system is a new initiative, and the government has planned it carefully. However, some unscrupulous merchants, who knew the benefits, used various methods to undermine it, and even more unscrupulous officials, who took advantage of it, have not been able to do their best for a while, which is extremely hateful. This time, the Hou Hu corruption case, the government authorities' constitution and punishment, was originally intended to strengthen the country and cultivate the lives of the people.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Rambling Talk on the Current Situation by Tokutomi Sohō <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Respectfulness is a virtue of the Japanese people, and enthusiasm is an inherent quality of the Japanese character. Even a glance at the Noh play "Hachi no Ki" reveals the passion and fiery spirit that resides within the Japanese heart. However, this kind of enthusiasm has gradually been lost in modern times, especially today in wartime.</p>
<p>Government authorities are desperately shouting for the importance of wartime enthusiasm and promoting its recovery, but the effects of the response are weak. Occasionally, cases of enthusiasm are discovered in society, and newspapers immediately publish them prominently. Based on this point alone, we can see that Japan is very lacking in enthusiasm. At this critical juncture, our 100 million Japanese compatriots should ask themselves, what will happen if we continue like this?</p>
<p>Heroic sacrifice is of utmost importance to complete the aims of the Greater East Asia War, but it is also essential to cultivate this enthusiasm. This enthusiasm can also be used to complete the war. The effects of the war can also be grasped, cultivated, and expanded with this enthusiasm. The ancients said that the benevolent are invincible, which proves the important position that enthusiasm occupies in human affairs, large and small, and we must understand this point.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the lack of enthusiasm, the dominance of so-called individualism is the greatest. No matter how much it harms others, as long as it benefits oneself, when this kind of thinking dominates humanity, enthusiasm will unknowingly disappear from the world. Although Britain and the United States are unable to fully control individualism, they still have the support of Christianity. Japan has no restraint and only practices individualism, so its drawbacks far exceed those of Britain and the United States by ____ times. Perhaps some people think that this is a thing of the past, and that the situation has already changed drastically, but in fact this kind of thinking is ____ ten thousand miles away from reality. Furthermore, it is even easier to fish in troubled waters during wartime. The lack of enthusiasm has become commonplace, and enthusiasm has become a rare exception. The shortage of labor due to the war is a natural thing. However, instead of thinking of ways to remedy this shortage, some people take advantage of the labor shortage to engage in all sorts of unenthusiastic actions and remain indifferent, not caring at all. This cannot be said to be anything other than taking advantage of the war to commit evil deeds.</p>
<p>If there were enthusiasm between people, seven or eight out of ten frictions and conflicts would disappear. Someone once told me:</p>
<p>"I went to a certain government office for something. A young official was sitting on a swivel chair, his feet propped up on the desk with his shoes on, and he treated the visitors with absolutely no respect. He not only didn't treat them as equals, but he almost didn't even treat them as human beings. It was truly infuriating and outrageous." Perhaps this is an exception. Such an official will definitely not get things done. However, we must not forget that such situations exist in society. We are not saying that only government offices today can be called unenthusiastic organizations. The phenomenon of unenthusiasm has already spread to every corner, no matter how remote or ____. If we do not thoroughly cleanse this atmosphere, Japan will never become a great power in the world, and the Japanese people will never be able to shoulder the task of leading Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is not only for people, but also for things. There is a big difference between doing things with enthusiasm and without enthusiasm, whether it is hammering a nail, sealing an envelope, or cutting a piece of paper. Today, almost no package arrives with its outer wrapping intact. Is this the fault of the sender, or is it the fault of the administrator? In any case, this is the result of someone, somewhere, lacking enthusiasm. What's worse, there are not a few cases of people taking advantage of the damaged packages to steal the contents. Perhaps one cannot generalize and say that all damage is done to steal the contents, but I don't believe that such things never happen. Since newspapers have recently been publishing articles about such repeat offenders being prosecuted, this proves that there are already many such negative phenomena in Japan.</p>
<p>Some people in society think that this is a small matter or that it is better to remain silent. Or some people are afraid of trouble and have the idea of "sweeping the snow from one's own doorstep," so everyone is indifferent to this unenthusiastic attitude. As a result, negative phenomena are becoming increasingly widespread. I think that there must be a lot of waste in every kitchen, not to mention large-scale military supply companies and similar organizations, due to a lack of so-called enthusiasm. According to newspaper reports, even in the single item of electricity, tens of thousands of watts can be saved. The president of a prominent newspaper in Tokyo personally supervised the work of the printing department and was said to have saved 10,000 yen in scrap paper as a result. There are such examples everywhere. If all 100 million people cultivate a kind of enthusiasm, whether it is for things, for people, for themselves, or for others, the benefits will be immeasurable.</p>
<p>Previously, some people in society often criticized those who did not give up their seats on trains or streetcars to children and the sick. Tracing back to the source, this is ultimately learned from their adults or elders. It is truly putting the cart before the horse to be unenthusiastic oneself but to demand enthusiasm from other adolescents or young people. If you want to demand enthusiasm from others, you must set an example yourself. This is the proper way.</p>
<p>The concept of responsibility is often mentioned in society, but the concept of responsibility does not fall from the sky. The concept of responsibility is causally related to enthusiasm. If enthusiasm surpasses the concept of responsibility, then even matters that are not within one's own responsibility will be taken on with a sense of responsibility. As a result, human affairs become more harmonious, and things in society become universally beneficial. When one is merely constrained by a sense of responsibility and lacks enthusiasm, it is like trying to operate a machine without lubricating oil, and it cannot run smoothly. Enthusiasm is the lubricating oil that makes all relationships flexible. Originally, we Japanese had a lot of this lubricating oil. It is truly a great pity that we have now lost it. We must quickly recover it, develop it, and bring it to full glory.</p>
<p>Today, many people's hearts are cold, and consequently their voices are also cold. When you look at their faces, they seem to be ready to quarrel. The excuse they give is that their minds are tense due to the war and they cannot change it. This kind of expression is most harmful in wartime, so it must be changed at all costs. To deal with a war of such great scale as the one we are conducting today with such a mournful ____, will only ruin things. As the ancients said, to laugh and joke in the face of life and death is the right way. To share an orange with each other, to share half a glass of wine, to exchange what we have and make up for what we lack, this is what reveals the true flavor of humanity. Today, because of the war, people wear a ____ face like a god of death from morning till night, and they will not be able to do things carefully. If we think that for the sake of our ancestors of 3,000 years, for the sake of our descendants of thousands of years, for the sake of this sacred war that is hard to come by in a thousand years, we, though ____ and insignificant, are one of 100 million compatriots, but we must all do our duty, so we should endure ____ poverty and suffering, and gladly be willing to brave fire and water. The so-called regarding death as returning home is this principle. Taking this opportunity, I want to say something frankly: there is an enthusiasm among the soldiers on the front lines and their relatives that far surpasses even the Noh play "Hachi no Ki." Recently, someone who inspected the fiercely fought battlefields of Rabaul and other areas said that there is no need to say that the army and navy are completely united as one, but even every single soldier forgets that death is imminent, and they raise high the banner of cooperation and happily share suffering. When I heard about this situation of unity and harmony between superiors and subordinates, I could not help but burst into tears of excitement. Only then are they qualified to be called Japanese. I hope that our compatriots in the home front will also follow the example of the soldiers on the front lines and restore the innocent, pure, and enthusiastic Japanese character.

<p>Exchange of Ideas Begins</p>
<p>Central News Agency - In order to improve the treatment of police officers and improve service efficiency, the First Police Bureau of the city is preparing to establish a consumer cooperative. On the 16th, it invited people from all walks of life to report on the purpose of establishing the cooperative and nominated sponsor members to carry out preparations.

<p>Speech by Commander Tsukazaki</p>
<p>The meeting began with an address by Tsukazaki Masatoshi (currently the police commander of the First Police Bureau and deputy director of police defense), chairman of the cooperative's preparatory committee, who said: "I am honored to serve as the police commander of the First Police Bureau and deputy director of police affairs. Today, I am deeply grateful to all of you for attending the talking meeting on the preparation of the consumer cooperative amidst your busy schedules and for providing great assistance and various agreements.

<h3 id="e37">Reflections on a Visit to Japan by Educational Figures in This City: The Spirit of Wartime Structure <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) A delegation of educators from this city recently visited Japan and witnessed firsthand the diligent service and spirited enthusiasm of the Japanese people under the wartime structure. Deeply impressed by the elevation of Japanese culture and seeking lasting peace between China and Japan, as well as the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War and the establishment of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, upon their return, they shared their observations in a symposium with Chinese and Japanese educators in this city. They reported in detail on the work of the Japanese home front under the wartime structure. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Common Knowledge</p>
<p>(A) The Current State of the Japanese Government's Cultivation of Common Knowledge Among the People (as presented by Shen Yiren, Principal of Zhongxin No. 1 Elementary School): Libraries are established not only in national schools but also in middle schools and universities. Numerous well-equipped libraries are also established in various cities and towns, and many people use them for reading. In science museums, the rapid progress of modern science in Japan is immediately apparent. The precision of various models and experiments is particularly astonishing. History museums feature prominent descriptions of various pictorial models and artifacts, which are clearly understandable to the general public. Aviation corps and aviation parks offer rigorous training of mental strength and strict discipline. The aviation parks are richly equipped, instilling aviation knowledge in the general public with a dual emphasis on practical application and theory. Botanical and zoological gardens are well-equipped, regularly open to the public, and not profit-oriented. Large-scale radio stations are established throughout the country, broadcasting public knowledge daily. Shrines and temples are established throughout the country, and people regularly visit them to worship the true gods, demonstrating the great unifying power of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>Social Facilities</p>
<p>(B) Overview of Japanese Social Facilities (as presented by Sun Cang, Principal of Zhongzheng No. 2 Elementary School): Regarding the overview of the Japanese newspaper industry, the scale of Japanese newspaper operations is grand, with rapid and comprehensive facilities for reporting, publishing, and other aspects. All newspaper employees are advancing with the goal of serving the country through newspapers. Additionally, newspapers are also published for domestic merchants. Therefore, the state of Japanese culture can be understood like the palm of one's hand. Factories and society: The development of the Japanese chemical industry is no less than that of Europe and America. Regarding the equipment of various factories, there are welfare facilities, such as schools, hospitals, sports facilities, and cooperative stores, all for the purpose of ensuring the livelihood of factory workers. This differs from the exploitative and selfish goals of Europeans and Americans. In Japanese factories, all production is dedicated to the state, and factory workers strive to produce for the country.</p>
<p>Transportation and Education</p>
<p>(C) Overview of Transportation (as presented by Sun Renlin, Principal of Zhongxin No. 3 Elementary School): Japan has a well-developed domestic transportation system, which is convenient for the people. Subways, underwater tunnels, steam trains, elevated railways, mountain railways, cable cars, suburban trains, etc., are all quite developed, not only fast and accurate but also safe and convenient. At the same time, the people adhere to traffic order and never crowd or rush. (D) Reflections on Japanese Education (as presented by Zhang Zhongyi, Principal of Zhongxin No. 5 Elementary School): There are numerous national schools in Japan, all under a compulsory system, fully equipped with spacious playgrounds and auditoriums. In middle schools, boys and girls are not segregated. Girls' middle schools especially emphasize home economics, instilling all common knowledge about home life, teaching cooking, laundry, sewing, flower arranging, tea ceremony, and other skills. The facilities of universities and vocational schools can be described as unparalleled in society. Students studying there are exceptionally frugal. Furthermore, there are schools established to train various disabled and incomplete people. In short, the educational policy of all schools in Japan focuses primarily on spiritual education and vocational education.</p>
<p>National Spirit</p>
<p>(E) The Spirit of the Japanese People (as presented by Cai Fucheng, Principal of Zhongxin Middle School): Firstly, regarding Japanese families, in every Japanese household, regardless of gender or age, the head of the family is the center, and everyone does their best. For example, a housewife fully manages the household, and in her spare time, she studies etiquette, tea preparation, flower arranging, and other skills as essential cultivation. She also emphasizes family education and guides her children. Furthermore, she is particularly cautious when her children receive secondary education. Each household has a shrine where they worship daily, encouraging their children to carry forward the spirit of their ancestors. Every Japanese person completely dedicates their body to the state, which fully demonstrates the people's patriotic enthusiasm. Moreover, the stability of life in Japan, the perfect distribution of materials, and the people's spirit of cherishing and carefully using resources are among the best in the world. This deeply impresses one with the enormous political power of Japan, the unwavering faith of the people in the government, and the united efforts of all, working towards the successful completion of the East Asia War.</p>
<h3 id="e38">The City Propaganda Department Held Its Tenth Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Municipal Issues <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) The City Propaganda Department held its tenth regular press conference at the City Hall yesterday. The questions raised by reporters from various newspapers and the answers from various agencies are recorded below:</p>
<p>Inferior Quality of Coal Briquettes Distributed</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Daily asked: The coal briquettes distributed in the third phase contain too much soil and cannot be burned. The composition of the coal briquettes distributed to users has been clearly stipulated, but the products from the coal factories are so poor. Does the authorities have appropriate measures to improve the situation? The Economic Department of the First District Office answered: The composition of the coal briquettes has been clearly stipulated by our department. However, some manufacturers may engage in illegal behavior. We are currently sending people out to investigate and supervise the production. We sincerely hope that citizens will report to our department at any time so that we can handle the matter according to the law.</p>
<p>Gambling Houses Will Not Be Postponed</p>
<p>The Xinzhongguo Daily asked: There are rumors that the ban on gambling houses in this city, which is scheduled for the end of March, will be postponed. Is this news reliable? What measures will the authorities take, or have they already made a decision? The Secretariat answered: All the rumors circulating outside are inaccurate. The government has already ordered all gambling houses to close on March 29 and will not postpone the date.</p>
<p>Security for Light Control</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Daily asked: With the implementation of permanent light control in this city, criminals will inevitably take the opportunity to act in the dark of moonless nights. What are the secret preventive measures taken by the police and Baojia authorities? The Security Section Chief of the First Police Bureau answered: 1. Since the implementation of light control on March 3, instructions have been issued to the heads of all branch bureaus to closely monitor the activities of undesirable elements. 2. Strengthen night patrols and increase the number of inspectors and field supervisors. 3. Enhance the close liaison between Baojia self-defense corps and the police. 4. Conduct regular checks of citizen certificates. 5. Maintain close liaison with relevant military and constitutional institutions. 6. The police authorities will do their best to maintain law and order, and we hope for the cooperation of the citizens. Furthermore, the Air Defense Section Chief of the First Police Bureau answered: The Electric Certificate Company is actively improving the modification of outdoor lights and will soon be able to make the light brighter than before, so the security situation will also improve at the same time.</p>
<p>Extortion by Police in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency asked: Traffic police near the Zhaofeng Garden in Western Shanghai often leave their posts without permission and extort money from passing travelers under the pretext of inquiries. Even when illegal activities are discovered, they accept bribes and let them go. The police authorities should be aware of this situation. What measures will be taken to crack down on this? The Security Section of the First Police Bureau answered: We are currently conducting a thorough investigation. If it is true, we will severely punish them. We hope that citizens will report the facts at any time.</p>

They must also adjust the deposit according to the amount of sugar tickets, paying any shortfall or receiving a refund. They must pay the purchase price to the designated distribution sugar store before the 23rd and immediately deliver the goods without delay. As for the date for users in Special Group One (i.e., the former Retailers of Class B) to exchange for purchase certificates, they will be notified separately after the distribution is completed.</p>

<h3 id="e42">After Long-Term Air Defense <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>It has been half a month since this city implemented long-term light control. We made some suggestions at the beginning of the implementation, but abuses have been heard from time to time during the past half month, especially the intolerable actions of lawless elements taking advantage of the situation. In response to this, the real-world problems of air defense and the security authorities should pay close attention to this and quickly find ways to prevent and eliminate them.</p>
<p>First, criminals take advantage of the darkness to feel their way around, especially on remote roads. We have previously advocated that lights may not be used during periods of bright moonlight. However, ordinary lights should be widely used, such as setting Nanjing Road's lighting as the standard, so that other roads should uniformly apply this standard, so as to reduce the chance of criminals using the darkness.</p>
<p>Second, be straightforward and stipulate that pedestrians are not allowed to pass after 11 p.m. If someone must pass through, they must obtain a pass. However, the procedures for issuing passes to citizens who need to pass through temporarily due to emergencies should be simplified. The operating hours of entertainment venues should be ended earlier, such as the Golden Grand Theater changing to end at 8:30 p.m. In fact, this measure is necessary and should have been implemented earlier from the perspectives of saving electricity and adapting to wartime life.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the general public will go out less at night when there is nothing to do, to avoid many troubles. At the same time, special attention should be paid to light leakage. It is better to train one's own habits than to obey the authorities' air defense orders.</p>

<p>The International Cup football match kicked off at the Jiangwan Stadium at 4 p.m. yesterday. There were also more than a thousand spectators. Because Russia faced Northern Europe, the strength of both sides was evenly matched, forming a stalemate. In the first half, Russia missed a penalty kick opportunity, which was a pity. In the second half, both sides attacked and defended, but neither side scored. As time expired, the score was 0-0. In extra time, Northern Europe's right winger, Krimi, dribbled straight into the Russian goal and finally won 1-0. In the quarter-finals, Northern Europe will meet Italy. In the two Group C matches yesterday, Zhonghua drew 1-1 with Qiaoxiao, and Sansheng defeated Hequn 3-1.</p>
<p>The second act of the International Cup will be held today at 4:30 p.m. at the Jiangwan Park, with Portugal facing Germany. The Portuguese team has a complete lineup today. The German team only has one player, Pike, who is worth watching. This game will definitely be one-sided. There are eight league games today. The four Group C games at Hongkou Park have been moved to Xuhui Middle School. There is one Group A game at 2:30 p.m. at Jiaoyuan, with Sansheng playing against Jewish.</p>

<p>It has been learned that the economic and food authorities are actively planning to thoroughly suppress prices and strictly crack down on profiteering. They plan to strengthen the organizational structure of guilds in various industries. For industries that are found to be lacking or have not been established, they will be ordered to establish them immediately so that they can formally exercise their powers. They will also be authorized to supervise the buying and selling of the same industry. If any failure to fulfill responsibilities or acts of harboring or other improper behaviors are discovered, they will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>The following individuals are not allowed to be representatives of the same industry in the guild: Individuals outside the industry. Those who have been deprived of their civil rights. Those who have committed acts that violate national law or have been sentenced for criminal offenses by a court. Those who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been restored. Those without capacity. The following individuals shall be ordered to resign: Those who neglect their duties or shirk their responsibilities. Those who violate laws and regulations in their duties, engage in embezzlement, or engage in other serious improper behaviors, as ordered to resign by the standing committee.</p>
<p>In addition to planning to strengthen the organizational structure of guilds in various industries, the authorities will continue to appoint preparatory members for guilds in various industries that have not been reorganized, and set a deadline for their formal establishment. The names of the four guilds recently approved by the City Economic Bureau are as follows: Import and Export Trade Guild, 169 Yuanmingyuan Road; Timber Guild, 3rd Floor, 14 Bowuyuan Road; Local Candle Guild, 3 Sanyili, Ninghe Road, Nanshi, opening meeting today; and Handmade Cotton Tape Guild.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Central Bank Implements Inspection of Loans <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In order to assist the government in cracking down on hoarding and suppressing prices, the Central Reserve Bank has implemented a tightening of interbank lending and has the Financial Affairs Inspection Office restrict the lending business of financial institutions, rejecting all mortgage loans for major commodities. As a result, general hoarders who use borrowed funds have become panicked and have sold their hoarded goods, causing prices to fall. It is reported that the Central Bank's tightening of interbank lending this time is a long-term measure and will not be relaxed halfway. However, interbank lending for legitimate purposes will continue to be handled in order to maintain legitimate interbank business and assist the development of industry and commerce. It is heard that the Central Bank's Financial Affairs Inspection Office has already implemented an inspection of lending business for financial institutions that use funds to hoard goods in order to thoroughly investigate and crack down on them.</p>

<p>March 13th (Sunday) Dark.</p>
<p>The Sundays after the exams have ended are truly leisurely.</p>
<p>During self-study, Major spoke about the aviation war, especially the attacking spirit of the naval air force. Even after the bullets and fuel were exhausted, they still attacked the enemy, which was ten times larger. It is truly a model for soldiers.</p>
<p>Secondly, a commander must make his subordinates sincerely submit and stand on the front lines to command everything. This is the tradition of the Navy, but when it is not possible, one must also possess the personality to make subordinates willingly die for him.</p>
<p>April 4th (Monday) Rain then clear.</p>
<p>The rain that started when the supervisor checked on time seemed to be deliberately ruining the blooming cherry blossoms. In the afternoon, it cleared up suddenly, and there was scheduled education. I felt something in my heart. My step forward is also the step forward of the Imperial Navy. The path is not far, and now we must do our best.</p>
<p>April 15th, 6th Boat Anniversary, Clear.</p>
<p>Short boat race training. If there is a slight disturbance, there is no way to deal with it, and one must admit that research is insufficient and there is a lack of agility at sea. …</p>
<p>On the anniversary of Lieutenant Commander Sakuma's disaster, we held a visit to the reference hall and sang military songs. One must know that Lieutenant Commander Sakuma was also the essence of the best from the graduates of Etajima.</p>
<p>April 17th (Sunday) Cloudy then rain.</p>
<p>Although it was Sunday morning at 0900 (Note: 9 is 9 o'clock, the navy uses a 24-hour system), we ate cakes sent by the officer candidate's dormitory at Yanghao Hall. After that, we organized our clothes and self-studied machinery. Although we study various subjects on Sunday mornings, we can go out at will in the afternoon.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>April 20th (Wednesday) Cloudy.</p>
<p>Regular wake-up. Organize the fishing gear. 0900 Student team supervisor's instructions. Graduated from China School. Take the "Ioi" warship from Koyou (Note: Name of the pier). (Note: Started shipboard training from today) 1300 Departed. Headed all the way to Osaka.</p>
<p>It is very beneficial for us who have no confidence in night navigation. 0800-1000 on duty. I deeply feel that naval officers must have good eyes.</p>
<p>April 21st (Thursday) Clear.</p>
<p>On duty from 0400. The fog was heavy, and the Akashi Strait was all in the fog at Goyo. At this time, the officer on duty must have calm and thorough hands. Although there are sailors available when entering the port, the work of mooring is also quite difficult.</p>
<p>Docked in Osaka. In the afternoon, visited the weather museum and took a free walk.</p>
<p>When the pier gathered, one person was late, which is a great pity. What are the officer students thinking?</p>
<p>April 22nd (Destiny Day) Clear.</p>
<p>Docked in Osaka.</p>
<p>0430 Wake up and go to visit the historical sites of Kusunoki Masashige. Take the Nankai Railway car to visit the ruins of Chihaya Castle and Chihaya Shrine.</p>
<p>After viewing the historical sites of Kusunoki Masashige and his son, who were loyal and died for their country, their loyalty, courage, and wisdom are truly worthy of our example. I was deeply moved to find the birthplace of Kusunoki Masashige, whom I had admired for a long time. (Note: This internship lasted eight days before returning to school)</p>
<p>May 2nd (Monday) Rain.</p>
<p>The first day that No. 1 ship was not available for fleet training (Note: No. 2 and others are in charge of guidance). It is mainly necessary to have enthusiasm and spirit. However, instructions (Note: This means that senior students reprimand junior students) must have firm beliefs in their hearts. It is not possible to simply intimidate; one must first lead by example.</p>
<p>May 25th (Wednesday) Clear.</p>
<p>The naval mine textbook was lost. I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. My heart was restless, and I couldn't accomplish anything. Today I learned that it was picked up by Instructor O. I went to the instructor's office to get the textbook during self-study. I was relieved. Because of my carelessness, I troubled all my classmates, which is a great pity. What price should I pay for this crime?</p>
<p>May 27th Navy Day.</p>
<p>Training started with the departure of the general ship's boats. 0630 Returned to school. 0915, Review and instructions. After the end, the memorial ceremony. Visit the memorial tablet in the reference hall.</p>
<p>1100, Outing inspection.</p>
<p>May 30th (Monday, Sun) Rain.</p>
<p>Although there was a planned small arms shooting competition, we waited for the sunny weather, but it never stopped. There were only two classes in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Today is the birthday of Marshal Togo. When visiting the reference hall and looking up to the great predecessors of the saint generals, I deeply felt the great responsibility of the navy in this extraordinary time.</p>
<p>June 3rd (Friday) Clear.</p>
<p>Practical navigation on the "Nara". Weather measurement, pressure has already occurred. In nighttime weather measurements, because the horizon is about to disappear, it must be done quickly. On a busy ship, it is especially necessary to concentrate.</p>
<p>National Forum</p>
<h3 id="e53">After the Latter Regulations <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Tian</p>
<p>Recently, I read in the newspaper that Hou Dachun, the former director of the Food Bureau of Jiangsu Province, and Hu Zheng, the director of the Aquatic Products Administration of the Food Department and the director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau of the Ministry of Construction, were found to have committed serious corruption during the purchase of military food during the war. After being explicitly dismissed from their positions by the National Government and handed over to a special court for trial, the trial has ended. Both criminals have confessed their guilt and have been sentenced to death. It is said that this case was reported by the Suzhou Allied Military Police, and thus brought to justice. The general public was greatly pleased to read this news. Is this what is meant by "the people of the country all say they should be killed"?</p>
<p>Hou and Hu, relying on the power of the government, engaged in such self-serving and corrupt activities, creating the current era of soaring prices and difficult food supply for the people. Although Hou and Hu have been brought to justice, there are probably many other corrupt officials like Hou and Hu. How can we ensure that they are all like the Suzhou Allied Military Police, who can report them without regard to personal feelings and bring them all to justice?</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the incident occurred, the so-called "profiteers of national crisis" made tens of thousands or even tens of millions of dollars, and such cases are common. These "nouveau riche" all used illegal means to obtain wealth. In principle, they should also be reported and punished as they deserve. I deeply hope that the National Government will take the punishment of corrupt officials as the starting point for creating a clean government and implement wartime price countermeasures. On the one hand, it should encourage reporting or denunciation, and if there is solid evidence, it must punish severely according to the law without regard to personal feelings. Then the people will be fortunate! The country will be fortunate!</p>
