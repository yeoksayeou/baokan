<p>社評</p>
<h3>嚴肅刻苦</h3>
<p>凡是到過日本的人，或在上海常有和日本人士接觸機會的人，都感覺到日本民族性共同的特點，就是「嚴肅刻苦」。他們的辦事精神，不敷衍，不苟且，不通融，時時刻刻拿出小冊子來筆記，一點不放鬆，一點不懈怠。他們穿了破舊的襯衫，破舊的皮鞋，在辦公室內吃「便當」，夜以繼日的工作着，哀食口腹之美，在他們好像是無所謂的，過奪生活在他們好像是應該的，而且已經自然而然地養成了習慣。這種嚴肅刻苦的習慣，不僅現在如此，過去亦然，并且一代受一代的影響，下一代的日本民族一定還要保持這個精神的。</p>
<p>這是日本立國的精神，這是日本民族優美的特點。日本從明治維新以後能够一躍而爲强國，解除英美的束縛，而爲世界人士所尊敬，基本原因就在於此。日本民族雖在艱苦困難的環境下，始終能够屹立不移，基本原因亦在於此。</p>
<p>嚴肅的意義就是認眞的工作，不是馬馬虎虎的工作。做一件事貫澈始終，一點不含糊。是者是之，非者非之，是非之間沒有籠統含混的餘地。所以，日本國民，凡是說到，必須做到，旣已開始，必須貫澈到底。民國十二年大地震之後，東京橫濱全市，差不多全成瓦礫之塲，他們規定了復興計劃，不上三年就全部都是新建築，使看過地震後情况的人，大爲驚異，嘆爲奇蹟。如下關門司間的海底火車道，在定了計劃之後，不聲不響地認眞工作着，最近又告落成了。如飛機的生產，在大東亞戰爭初期是趕不上英美的，經過重點生產計劃之後，現在據航空兵器總局長官遠籐中將的發表，已經成爲世界第二之飛機生產國。日本國民這樣的嚴肅工作，嚴肅工作的結果有這樣偉大的成績，反觀我國，不勝汗顏。</p>
<p>刻苦的意義就是過苦生活，過苦生活的最大意義就在不浪費。他們認定，在國家有安定之，每個國民不允許浪費一分一秒的時間，每個國民不允許浪費一絲一毫的物力。吃「便當」飯，第一是省錢，第二是省時，眞是便當。在大地震之後，全東京市都只是些草棚，只是些洋鉛皮蓋着的木房子，替東京市做復興工作的人，過的簡直不是人過的生活，可是，工作却夜以繼日地進行，每個人耐着苦認眞工作，到了高樓大廈在市上一座座建立起來的時候，誰也想不到這是草棚裏面的一羣人勞心勞力的結果。反觀我國，慚愧莫名。</p>
<p>嚴肅刻苦的斟酌信仰在首獨立自尊。日本國民不存依賴人家的心理，他們只憑自己的努力奮鬥，他們認定，只要幹，認眞地幹，刻苦耐勞的幹，萬事沒有不成功的·「人定勝天」一句話在日本歷史上有着最正確的證明，更足爲我人的借鏡。</p>

<h3>小磯首相訓詞要旨</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　日小磯首相二十三日在地方長官會議席上致訓辭，歷時四十分鐘，就應付次其決戰，完遂大東亞戰爭所應看重之點，披瀝所懷，並切盼各地長官積極協力與確切實踐。蓋首相此次訓辭，首在明示施政方針與最高戰爭指導會議之運用相互呼應，其在政治上之意義非常重大。訓詞要旨如次：</p>
<p>勇猛精進擊破英美</p>
<p>戰局現在要求積極集結國力，敵軍刻正以其自誇之豐富物資，一再拚命全力反攻，吾人應知於奪取馬利亞納羣島之一角後，敵方無厭貪慾將選定何方爲其進攻目標，其對日本本土之空襲，當必益趨激烈，且我人更須預想，敵方亦有伺機於日本本土登陸之勢。在現在緊迫時局中，保衛皇國，惟有擊破英美與以勝利結束大東亞戰爭之一途，欲以勝利打破大東亞戰爭之難關，首須傾盡凡能化爲戰力之國力，陸海兩軍尤須打成一體，勇猛精進，一億同胞，更須以必勝之信念昂揚戰意。此種精神力，在各種國家組織中，均奏有偉大效果，且以具有犧牲精神之勤勞表現之，其於優越技術之發揮，與精神軍需之生產上，亦將收獲最大之效果。</p>
<p>昂揚戰意刷新行政</p>
<p>時局之緊迫，復要求昂揚戰意，決心奮戰到底，皇國日本以萬邦共榮爲其世界政策之理想標目，必須永久護衛皇國君民一體之國體，以謀社會與民生這一祉之悠久。無論任何難關，皆能將之突破，始可護衛國體。爲發揮社會生產之最高能力，當使生產行政簡捷化，若仍事因循，絕難獲得勝利，皇國之興亡，由此決定，政府有鑒於此，正力求改善刷新行政，以應急需。政府極力檢討改善內部方法，以期確保必要程度之生活狀態，希望各位人人努力，亦望各位牢記。關於中日滿之農作開發，已較昔日加倍努力，惟因人力資源緊迫，今後仍望各位協力。</p>
<p>武裝全民防衛國土</p>
<p>至國土防衛，日本自古未遭敵軍到達，此不外全由於日軍勇敢善戰所致，故敵方無論如何，決不能侵入日本本土，日本帝國以來，全國皆兵，兵農一致，故我一億國民，除一面從速增產，貢獻軍隊外，並須武裝全民，防衛國土。武裝國民，第一須堅持精神的決戰，一億國民均須奉公職守，同時應具必勝之自覺及認識，克服所有艱難。政府前曾決定，加强國內警備態勢之具體方策，各位亦應遵照上項旨趣，努力準備訓練，更應講求臨機應變措置，苟能達成國土防衛，即可以確保當地即應之態勢。</p>
<p>銘記現實急速增產</p>
<p>關於庶政執行，務期迅速，確世認識事態之眞相，指導與論，期下情上達，實踐國民運動，發揮即時敏速指導之最大效果，尤其接近國民之官吏，應即切實一秉大公，以確保國民同胞之信賴，現在情勢，已入次期決戰，應切實銘記現實環境，向急速增產，增强戰力，防衛國土之途邁進。</p>

<h3>新疆邊境渝蘇衝突</h3>
<p>北平二十三日中央社電　去年十二月，中國西北邊境，發生渝蘇武力衝突事件。是時蘇聯政府曾發表賺苛之盤明，曾予渝方甚大之反應。據常地所獲之情報稱，最近新深省迪化北方之國境地帶，又發生軍事衝突事件。前年秋季，渝方懷柔新疆省主席盛世才後，曾命駐守陜甘邊境星星峽一帶之楊德亭第四十二軍，進駐新彊。其後更陸續增派大批兵力，編成集國軍，盤據於哈密迪化等要衝，如是新疆省逐漸化為中央軍之武力地帶。在本年五月，第四十二軍與蘇聯軍又於迪化北方之國境地帶，發生衝突，情形極為激烈。傳蘇聯空軍曾前來轟炸迪化油田，兩者之軍事關係，隨渝政權西北工作之進展，及德蘇戰綫之推移，再加在渝美空軍向西北擴充基地等情形，今後必日趨複雜。</p>

<h3>日軍攻佔衡陽後　渝美打擊慘重　出淵部長談湖南戰况</h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬陸軍部報道部所主持之定例報道常會，於昨（二十三）日下午三時循例假南京路外灘華　飯店八樓，接見本市中國新聞記者，出淵報道部長躬親出席外，並到赤星囑託，即席由出淵部長就日軍攻佔衡陽後，渝方及美在渝空軍狼狽狀熊，發表談話　祥。茲分誌要點如次：</p>
<h3>狼狽狀態暴露無遺</h3>
<p>出淵部長首謂，自街陽為日軍攻領後，給於渝美影嚮重大，且因所應受之蠢動狼狽現狀，日漸在彼本身之言行間，充分暴露無遺。例如敵美之輿論，曾披露謂因衝陽之陷落，雖美軍　取塞班島，其效果則等於零。今次蔣介石因個陽之陷落，被在渝美空軍逼迫，又嚴命薛岳從事奪回　陽之舉，其兵力約有十師，刻在衝陽四逾繼續作盲目之蠢動，而日軍對渝軍之蠢動現狀，絕不容許，故已繼續加以掃蕩，使其無從設施，因此渝軍至目前，已無法採取積極攻勢，祇進行建築陣二工事，以採取對峙態度。渝方嚴近又特別注戚桂林，固預料日軍即將攻製，故防範至為嚴密，據開為準備防範起見，淪蔣己特派高級將領赴該地策劃，同時渝軍又已開始破壞湘桂鐵絡，並動員一般農民，破壞至內地之主要道路。以如此舉動而觀，足見渝方之情形，狼狽不堪，里現恐慌已極之狀態。</p>
<h3>敵機喪失五百餘架</h3>
<p>敵美在渝空軍在衡陽陷落一役中，遭受慘重打擊，猶圖繼續作阻撓日軍之作戰，棄不惜傾舉殘餘勢力，連續空襲和平地區，及北九洲日本本土等地，當可規見敵美空軍作最後之蠢動之一般。其企國目標地區，依然在湖南戰塲，此外在東南中國海面，及日本之軍輪錢方面，亦稍受妨碍。本月二十日及二十一日晨曦未明時，敵美空軍曾兩次空襲日本本土，據聞該兩次敵方所策動之飛機，為動員（第二十航空隊全部兵力，使用B二十九刑轟作機，每架載航空人員為十二人至十五人，在此空襲中，一無所疲，反被日軍攀落二十三架，我人以每架十二人計算，敵美有二百七十六個航空人員之死亡。惟日方僅有戰鬥機三架損失，航空人員只三人陣亡，以日美間之損失相比，殊不可同日而語，由此可知敵美之損失慘重。同時日本航空隊為擊滅敵美在渝空軍之殘餘勢力，故不斷繼繼活動，最近自本月十一日至十七日，此七日中連績空襲西安·漢中·梁山·柳州·桂林·建甌等飛行塲據點，先後將其擊落擊毀及起火焚燬敵機，各有五十餘架。惟自今次作戰開始以來，日空軍擊落敵機總數，共有五百二十能架。</p>
<h3>渝方掩飾衡陽敗績</h3>
<p>旋出淵部長又指出渝方軍事發言人曾慶極少將，在本月十八日接見新聞記者時所發表之渝軍在衡陽攻略戰之損害，其情形至為突梯，今指其主要內容而言稱：渝軍在衡陽防衛戰上之損害，總計有一萬五乖哈，而在衡陽陷落之前，所受損失亦同，前後共計三萬人，惟在最後一日，殘存衛陽城內之渝軍，只二千人而已，此項數字之發表，殊為虛偽不確，當日軍佔領衡陽時，俘虜渝軍有第十軍長方先覺以下所部有一萬三千三百人之多，根據該數字而觀，則渝方軍事發言人顯然掩飾敗績，作虛偽報道，反之除此二千人之外，對尚有一萬一千三百人俘虜，絕對不提，此足見不負責任，充分暴露對軍屬漠不關心，及存拋棄態度，反觀日本方面，最為關懷者，為中國大陸之戰士，及中國之民衆。日本政府曾數度聲明，在中國大陸之作戰，其對象並非為渝軍，而為撲滅敵美之侵略勢力，如果將敵美在華之勢力完全驅逐，一掃廓淸，則目前在中國大陸之殘酷戰事即可避免，而人民亦可免受戰禍災害。部長最後歸納結論，關於大陸戰爭，淪政權應負相當責任，頃渝政權之性格，不啻為叛變之巴特里奧政權無異，惟目前渝方之環境，悉受英美所　使。</p>

<h3>加强食糧統制　取締麵粉移動　由經濟保安處執行處分</h3>
<p>來本市市民不明粉麩移動規定，迭有負肩麵粉紹越限制移動規定，而遭沒收，記者特訪據粉麥統制委員會主任委員孫保立談稱，政府當局為安定民生，對於食糧加强統制，故規定取締移動辦法，頗為週密，惟尚有一般市民，不能明瞭統制意義，負肩麵粉，至滬銷售，紊亂統政，市府物品配給處及經濟保安處，為協助本委員會完成統制工作，會同商定辦法，由上海區粉麩統配處擬訂移動處理規則，公告施行，並由經濟保安處執行取締移動事宜，本委員會亦派員協助檢査，至於其軌行處分之權，事關警察行政，當然究全屬於經濟保安處。</p>
<h3>巿民開井取水　應愼選地點　免損地下公共設備</h3>
<p>本市目來用水，因華中水電公司適應戰時體制，節約自來水月電，故將供送水量及時間均加限制，市民對用永遂感不便，故頗多自掘自流井以數應用。各保甲當局亦自動開掘，除供民用外，並用以應付萬一。對此問題，記者詢諸有關當局，據稱市民開　自流井，雖可絕對自由，惟須愼重選揀適當地點，且須延聘專家設計開掘，以免損毀地面下之各種公用設備略謂今：（二十一）日為印度臨時自由政府成立十個月紀念日，在領袖江特拉鮑斯領導下我們已向祖國印度邁進，你們都明白這次戰爭，不僅是為了解放福國，爭取自由，同時也是為了獲得大東亞共存共榮，我們的軍隊在明邦日本軍協刀合作之下，正為此目的，向德里前進。繼由印度國民軍訓練營指揮那倫上尉致詞，繼即由印僑自由捐輸，統計是日收到款項十二萬三千元。</p>
<h3>特種麵粉　恢復配給</h3>
<p>關於本市特種麵粉之　續配給，市物品配給處，決予尅期恢復，日前曾邀集本市點心業·粉糰·罐頭·切麵·餅饅·茶食業·茶食號業·酒菜業·及餅麵油絛業等舉行懇談，本市粉麵統配處，亦派員列席，由福田敏郎主席，略云：特種粉麵即將尅日恢復配給，盼各該公會迅即造具會員名册，以便核配，此後尤盼各教業對於門售麵製品之價格，須依照粉價為標準，不得有所逾越，致遭停配處分。</p>
<h3>米統會內　發照處結束</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會，前會根據京滬兩巿民食米臨罌措俊要綱，訂定米織搬入申請及發照辦法，除十二個發照所外，在該會亦辦理發照事宜，惟將米糧搬入證明單，定七日內為有效期間，各發照所所發之證明單有效期問為期僅限一天，茲悉該會在會所內之申請發照，已自昨（二十三）日起停止辦理，嗣後市民申請證明者，應前往附近各該發該所申請，其所發證明單，一律改為一天為有效期間。</p>
<h3>防犯當局盼醫師　尊重醫德</h3>
<p>關於本巿各公私立醫院，往往蔑視貧病，業經巿警察局司法處令飭嚴予糾正在案，又據該處防犯科石科長語記者，査有一般國醫，亦有是項情事，對往求治者，向有掛號之例，而又分拔號特別掛號等名目，藉詞倍收診費，便利一般富有人士，而貧病者雖其病勢沉重，仍須延遲就醫，往往因此使其病勢加重，於法律道德，均所木許，故已令飭嚴密調查。總之希望醫生醫師須尊重醫藥道德，視病不視錢，對求治病人，先應觀察病熊，對重症者應先予診治。</p>
<h3>本巿印僑舉行　慶祝大會</h3>
<p>本市印度獨立聯盟上海支會，為慶祝印度臨時自由政府成立紀念起見，會於二十一日下午四時，在跑馬廳召集全市印僑舉行大會，由却特會長主席，行禮如儀，唱印度國歌後，首由却特致詞，</p>

<p>本市物品配給處奉令成立後，暫設於江西路前經濟處原址辦公，但昨日起全部遷赴泰山路前第八區公署內，至江西路該處遺址，聞將由市府改為秘書處及文牘科辦公。</p>
<h3>換領脚踏車執照　浮收額外費用　公用局盼市民檢舉</h3>
<p>據本月廿一日上海晚報所裁，市民換領脚踏車照時，倘付以數十元額外費用，即可換領新執照，否則須延宕時日等情，公用局負責人特發表談話云：本局巳對該報　以書面答覆（原文另錄）。</p>

<h3>餅饅同人熱心可嘉</h3>
<p>「竊我餅饅同人，咸屬勞苦大衆，平日對於祖先祭祀，向少單獨舉行，所謂心有餘而力不足，故每屆中元，輒由業中同人發起打蘸之舉，實則亦可謂「集衆追薦」耳。「今同人等感於　報倡導「助學」之重要，故除舉行簡單之磯式外，將往例化作錫箔灰之儲券一萬元正，專陳奉上，移充有益之助學運動，明知杯水車實，無濟於事，然各界人士若人人能以「錫箔灰變鈔票」為宗旨，來擴大助學運動，則聚沙成塔，同人等拋磚引玉之初衷，有厚望焉！」此外寗波同鄕會畫廳以樂齋主人名義捐助二萬五千元，綢業公會門市聯益組，兩議記，各捐一萬元，大華汽車實易公司經募一萬元，感意均足銘惑，</p>

<h3>凟職可能</h3>
<p>辦理事務的職員，因為外界的誘致，和內在的　雜，而致有凟職的行為，這是極可能的事。本局對於此點，曾作最大的努力，希望予以杜絕與儘量的减少，最近三個月內，因此而撒職的人員，就有二十餘人之多。</p>
<h3>巿民放任</h3>
<p>檢騐脚踏車的手續，和脚踏車領照所必須具備的條件，是極其簡單與明瞭的，而經辦的簡單與明繚的，而經辦的人員，還能够作弊，這是完全是市民的放任與有且的綠故。根據本局四年來經過的事實，從來沒有幾個巿民肯對此種現象，做過正面的報吿，或是建設有效的取締方法的。</p>
<h3>絕不包庇</h3>
<p>本局可以絕對負責聲明，凡是本局職員，本局絕不包庇他們的舞弊行動，或掩飾他們舞弊的事實，如果本局接到任何一個市民的報告，無論其眞實與否，都立刻加以澈查，澈査之後，立刻予以應得的處分的，同時對於輿論上之批評或指示，樂於接受。</p>
<h3>巿民合作</h3>
<p>本局每一處車輛登記所，都標貼有明顯的收費數目，假使超出這數月的收費，市民可以拒付，而且應談拒付，更進一步拘解經手辦理的人員，來局究辦，或者記明時間地點和經辦人員的面貌等等，報告本局，以作有效的處置。總之，無論如何，關於肅淸貪汚這一點，非得市民的合作，必不會有什麼成續的。</p>
<h3>須用新照</h3>
<p>本局對於貴報主錢領不到新照時，仍用舊照，俟警察干涉，再行說明這一點，認為極不妥當，新照是沒有不能領到的理由的，而交通行政，正屬於本局職掌，絕不是警察的事。</p>
<p>本局鄭重聲明，並同時請求市民注意，公用局任何職員，都不能向市民收受仟何費用，因為一切行政特的收入，完全由財政局辦理的，公用局祗負車輛檢騐和登記的責任，絕對不直接收費，希望貴報對本局在交通管理的措施上，和人事行政上，有適常的指示。上海特別市公用局，三十二，八，二十三。</p>

<h3>局長談話</h3>

<h3>公開答覆為報販黑巿浮故事</h3>
<p>最近本報常接讀者夾信報告，報販不照規定報費，額外浮收，形成報價黑市，殊堪痛恨。本報近正研究澈底取締方法，不久即可實施。不及一一答覆，即希公鑒為幸。　申報社啓</p>
<h3>敵美犧牲渝方遂其侵略野心　松島部長盼渝方速醒</h3>
<p>敵美車現空襲日本土，以渝方地區為據點，日形暴露其對日戰爭之意圖，且非　以中國為轟炸基地，更調遣陸軍部隊開往渝方，擬澈底利用渝方，以渝方為犧牲，藉遂其壓榨亞洲之野望。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，特於二十二日接見大陸新報記者，對於美國之邪慾，加以毫不假借之批評，摘發美國空襲日本之脆弱性，並就現下渝方之立塲，處於抗日旗幟下與美英之侵略勢力間之苦惱情視，加以解剖。無今日正為渝方之覺醒機會，而不能再事躊躇，其言如次：</p>
<h3>渝方採用以夷制夷</h3>
<p>渝方多年主張之問題，即為中國主權之獨立，與領土之完整，因比美駐渝空軍與渝軍間屢次發生糾紛，中國民衆對於夷駐渝軍人之橫暴熊度，抱極大反感。最近傳在桂林及其他地區，造次發生燒打，暴動等事件，其根本理念，蓋認為中國係中國人之國土所致。因此渝當局亦採用以夷制夷之政策，一面則深感　種矛眉，迄今會極度警戒美英軍之侵入中國，現因不堪衡陽失守及其他現在之困境，結果渝行政院參事張平羣，宣傳部長梁寒操等，公開發表，歡　　英軍早日開赴渝方之意見。</p>
<h3>迷夢不醒悔之恐晚</h3>
<p>當然，此種趨勢，蓋美英由印度及太平洋方面，均以中國之領十為目標，蔑視其主權，希圖使中國全土陷於如義大利之戰火中，使全中國民衆捲入憶烈之現代職中，供其犧牲，以達成美英少野瓔，此種企圖極為明　。渝方如於此憏，仍堅持其從來之政策，如不惜以本國了衆為犧牲，則以夷制夷之方針，反為美國所利用，此種事實將使中國之一部人士，誤認和平時美英軍即行歸國之迷夢，徹底打破。當此期間，渝方悔之已遲，致必苦惱不置，渝方人士應考慮者，厥為此點。</p>
<h3>四國會談離奇複雜</h3>
<p>又須連帶考慮者，即美英蘇三國代表廿一日於華盛頓舉行戰後和平會議是也，當茲戰爭激烈時期，而舉行是項會談，其用意蓋欲團結反軸心國之連擊，俾可對中立國加以宣傳，尤以美國之欲預先獲得蘇聯對於戰後經警方策之實質，此種野望，亦至屬明顯，且此項會談，渝方代表被摒除在外，又定於九月舉行之同樣會談，則僅為美英渝三者之會談。以此而觀，該四者間之複雜離奇關係，已自行暴露。一方面渝方被美英輕視之左證，於此可得明暸。</p>
<h3>敵美野心露骨表示</h3>
<p>抑又有言者，美國羅斯福於目前往太平洋方義視察後，聲明：美國應確保連結阿貿地安，西伯里亞，遠東地方中國之連絡路，或徵諸美國所言，應占有赤道以北，北緯三十度以南之全部烏嶼之事實等，可知美國於和平會議中，將號露骨表示其野望也。如是於大戰結束後，如使美英仍剩留於地球上，則必將現出更慘烈之弱肉强食之暗黑時代，我人由此點着想，寶極期待渝方人士之一致覺醒奮起外，断然對於此職，決辦加强化實澈路戰勝之信念。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　消費特稅發行稅票問題</h3>
<p>— 費兆安</p>
<p>消費物稅舞弊案，業已引起全巿關注。當局除秉公嚴密偵查外，一面應積極改善整個方案，妥籌對策。回顧過往特稅處微收人員，中間極易滋弊，不易直接統制監察，鉅額稅收，注入中飽，影饗財政稅收頗大。按是項舞弊案起源於執行微收稅欵之際；故今後對微收及納稅雙方手續上間題有着切實改革的必要。</p>
<p>稅收需要整頓，為防止特稅再度發生舞弊及減少偷稅情專起見；手績愈簡單愈公開愈好，那末殊有援用印花稅貼票制之例，發行消費特稅票之價値，令商號售出貨物時必須計值貼用特稅票，一如印花稅票之貼用然。如此使納稅者無從逃捐，消滅作弊漏稅機會，使釋手人員不能　旅慣技，辦法旣充分公開，納稅者完全明瞭，經手者無從隱瞞，手續明白簡單經手人縱欲取巧作弊，而不可能了。特稅票對今後稅收的增裕及舞弊案的絕跡，有着很大的裨益消費特稅票的發行是值得考慮一番其重要性的</p>
<h3>社會服務　防疫注射人員應注意針頭消毒</h3>
<p>防疫注射，已於八月一日開始，各防疫工作人員，及保甲防疫班，均在加緊工作，為巿民防疫。但鄙人目見數處注射人員，常用針筒（10c.c.或2c.c.）吸取疫苗，裝上針頭，不加消毒，連績注射十數人，注完乃止，甚有自始至終，不加消毒，反覆使用同一針頭針筒，以致識者見之，莫不視為畏途，規避注射。</p>
<p>蓋人體血液中，常有病原菌潛伏，如梅毒螺旋體Spiro　chaeta　pallida，瘧疾原蟲Plasmodiummalariae等，此等患者，外表一如常人，不易覺察，但針頭如與此等病原菌血液接觸，未經消毒，轉注於他人身上，即有傳染之危險。</p>
<p>上海梅毒患者極多，一旦傳染，遣害子孫，賞為民族健康之大敵，故請防疫注射人員注意，每一針頭未用之先、必須消毒，旣用之後，未經消毒，决不可再用第二次，針筒在無菌操作之下，不妨用至菌苗完畢為止，但若未經消毒，亦不可再吸菌苗。至於消毒方法，但用酒精碘酒，揩拭針頭，不能謂為確切消毒，惟實行沸煮消毒，方能將一切無芽胞細繭殺死，即抵抗最强之脾脫疽桿菌芽胞，亦能於數十分內殺死，而後方為安全可靠。</p>
<p>注射人員如為節省時間，可仿照第一區衛生處，用數百隻針頭及數十雙，然後復將用過針頭針筒，聚集再煮。如是旣省時間，又無後患，法良意善，大堪仿傚。事關民衆健康，請常局注意及之。（周富與）</p>

<h3>宿願（八）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 石田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>隆夫把很久封閉的房間，打開所有的窗戶，隆夫就急忙拆開眞人的信了。甚至忘掉旅途的渡倦，而感覺到心坎在跳動，一字一句地注意續着信。</p>
<p>信，好像是眞人搬出宿舍前的頭一晚上寫的。</p>
<p>由於任務關係，暫時與吳港離別了，但個中情形，有避免拍電報至鹿兒島去的必耍，所以或許讓你白跑了一趙，實在對不起！——這是信的冒頭語。</p>
<p>——但，隆夫你要高興的！自從你回家數天後，偶然我在水交社碰到了飛田中校。我所講的飛田中校，或許你一時想不起來。甚至同一機關內的我，只在眞碰到飛田中校時，才曉得的。</p>
<p>隆夫呵！我們在二中三年級的時候，菊池陸軍少校率領着，到江田島去參觀，你還記得麼？常時穿着白色制服的值班將校，不是給我們作過講演麼？由於那次講演，你和我都非常感動，後來我們還常常提到這件事。那位大官，就是飛田中校。當時好像還是上尉。</p>
<p>我一看到中校的面孔，立刻就想起來，而把當時的情况報告給他。於是中校也想起來了，因為那時的中學生中，出了八名海軍士官，他自己也非常高興。</p>
<p>後來我問到中校的現職時，他就給我了一張名片。一看，銜上寫着海軍報道部。他在部內服務，據說因某種職務而來吳鎭的。</p>
<p>我偶然聯想到你的宿願，所以我認為這是最好的機會。於是我就告訴他，你也是當時中學生的一個人，比任何人希望海軍都熱烈，不幸因體格檢査而落選，有忘海軍而成為海軍畫家。這樣一五一十地都吿訴了他。</p>
<p>中校不公非常同情你，而且提到獲得海軍大臣賞的故事時，他還說，原來是他呵，我是知道他的名字。</p>
<p>因此，我更告訴他，你需要海軍知識，是抱着很大希望的。於是，中校很想和你見一面。我聰到這句話後，使我快樂得雀躍起來。軍人普通是不肯這樣說的。</p>
<p>隆夫呵！這樣好的機會，是不容易多得的。你拿着我的介紹信，無論如何請到部裏拜訪中校。無論如何，一有機會，我就會通知你的。那末，再見吧！請你珍重！（一三五）</p>

<h3>Solemn Diligence</h3>
<p>Everyone who has been to Japan, or those in Shanghai who often have the opportunity to interact with Japanese people, feels that the common characteristic of the Japanese national character is "solemn diligence." Their work ethic is meticulous, not perfunctory, and inflexible. They constantly take out small notebooks to take notes, never letting up, never slacking off. They wear worn shirts and old leather shoes, eat "bento" in the office, and work day and night. It seems that they do not care about the pleasure of food, and it seems that deprivation of life is something they should endure and have naturally become accustomed to. This habit of solemn diligence is not only present now, but also in the past, and is influenced by each generation, and the next generation of Japanese people will definitely maintain this spirit.</p>
<p>This is the spirit of the founding of Japan, and this is the excellent characteristic of the Japanese nation. The basic reason why Japan has been able to leap to become a powerful country since the Meiji Restoration, get rid of the shackles of Britain and the United States, and be respected by people all over the world lies in this. The basic reason why the Japanese nation has always been able to stand firm in difficult and arduous environments also lies in this.</p>
<p>The meaning of solemnity is to work conscientiously, not to work haphazardly. Do one thing from beginning to end, without any ambiguity. Yes is yes, no is no, and there is no room for vagueness between right and wrong. Therefore, the Japanese people must do what they say, and must carry it through to the end once they have started. After the great earthquake in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, almost the entire city of Tokyo and Yokohama became a field of rubble. They stipulated a restoration plan, and within three years, all of them were new buildings, which greatly surprised those who had seen the situation after the earthquake and exclaimed it as a miracle. For example, the undersea railway tunnel between Shimonoseki and Moji has been working seriously and silently after the plan was set, and it has recently been completed. For example, aircraft production could not keep up with Britain and the United States in the early days of the Greater East Asia War. After the key production plan, according to the announcement of Lieutenant General Endo, Director of the Aviation Ordnance General Bureau, it has now become the second largest aircraft producer in the world. The Japanese people's solemn work and the results of solemn work have such great achievements. Looking back at our country, we cannot help but feel ashamed.</p>
<p>The meaning of diligence is to live a hard life, and the greatest meaning of living a hard life is not to waste. They believe that when the country is stable, every citizen is not allowed to waste a minute or a second of time, and every citizen is not allowed to waste a single bit of material resources. Eating "bento" is first to save money and second to save time, which is really convenient. After the great earthquake, the entire city of Tokyo was just some thatched sheds, just some wooden houses covered with zinc sheets. The people who were doing the restoration work for Tokyo were simply not living the lives of people, but the work was carried out day and night, and everyone endured the hardship and worked seriously. When tall buildings were built one by one in the city, no one would have thought that this was the result of the hard work of a group of people in thatched sheds. Looking back at our country, we are extremely ashamed.</p>
<p>The belief in solemn diligence is based on independence and self-esteem. The Japanese people do not have the mentality of relying on others. They only rely on their own efforts and struggles. They believe that as long as they work hard, work seriously, and work hard, nothing will not succeed. The saying "Man will conquer nature" has the most accurate proof in Japanese history, and it is even more worthy of our reference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Clarifies Policy to Cope with the Next Decisive Battle Important Meeting of Local Governors Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) The first meeting of local governors of the Japanese Koiso Cabinet was held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 8:00 a.m. on the 23rd, with the participation of governors of all prefectures and prefectures in Japan, including Governor Nishio of Tokyo. The government authorities present included Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet ministers and related officials. After the meeting, Prime Minister Koiso first explained the importance of the war situation, revealed the government's determination, and encouraged local governors to cooperate in strengthening combat power. Then, Foreign Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Shigemitsu, Army Minister Sugiyama, and Navy Minister Yonai delivered speeches. At 9:30, they went to the office together, and at 10:30, the meeting continued. After speeches by Agriculture and Commerce Minister Shimada, Military Supplies Minister Fujiwara, Transportation Minister Maeda, and Finance Minister Ishiwatari, they began to discuss urgent issues such as strengthening combat power. They took a break at noon, had lunch, and continued to discuss everything at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Main Points of Prime Minister Koiso's Address</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Prime Minister Koiso delivered an address at the meeting of local governors on the 23rd, which lasted for 40 minutes. He revealed his thoughts on the points that should be emphasized in coping with the next decisive battle and completing the Greater East Asia War, and earnestly hoped that local governors would actively cooperate and implement them faithfully. The Prime Minister's address was primarily to clarify the government's policies and to echo the operation of the Supreme War Guidance Conference. Its political significance is very significant. The main points of the address are as follows:</p>
<p>Bravely Advance to Defeat Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The current war situation requires the active gathering of national strength. The enemy is currently desperately launching a full-scale counterattack with its boasted abundant resources. We should know that after seizing a corner of the Mariana Islands, the enemy's insatiable greed will select where to be its target of attack. Its air raids on the Japanese mainland will definitely become more and more intense, and we must also anticipate that the enemy also has the potential to land on the Japanese mainland when the opportunity arises. In the current urgent situation, the only way to protect the Imperial Country is to defeat Britain and the United States and end the Greater East Asia War with victory. If we want to break through the difficulties of the Greater East Asia War with victory, we must first devote all possible national strength to transform it into combat power. The Army and Navy must work together as one, advance bravely and vigorously, and one hundred million compatriots must raise their fighting spirit with the belief in victory. This kind of spiritual power has played a great role in various national organizations, and it is expressed through diligent labor with a spirit of sacrifice. It will also reap the greatest effect in the development of superior technology and the production of spiritual military supplies.</p>
<p>Raise Fighting Spirit and Refresh Administration</p>
<p>The urgency of the situation also requires raising fighting spirit and the determination to fight to the end. The Imperial Country of Japan must permanently protect the national polity of the unity of the monarch and the people, and seek the long-term welfare of society and the people. No matter what difficulties, we can break through them to protect the national polity. In order to give full play to the highest capacity of social production, we should simplify production administration. If we still procrastinate, it will be difficult to achieve victory. The rise and fall of the Imperial Country depends on this. The government is aware of this and is striving to improve and refresh administration to meet urgent needs. The government is making every effort to review and improve internal methods to ensure the necessary level of living conditions. I hope that everyone will work hard, and I hope that everyone will keep this in mind. We have doubled our efforts in the agricultural development of China, Japan, and Manchuria compared to the past, but due to the tight human resources, we still hope that everyone will cooperate in the future.</p>
<p>Arm the Entire People to Defend the Country</p>
<p>As for the defense of the country, Japan has never been reached by enemy troops since ancient times. This is entirely due to the bravery and skill of the Japanese army in battle. Therefore, no matter what, the enemy cannot invade the Japanese mainland. Since the founding of the Japanese Empire, the whole country has been soldiers, and the military and farmers are united. Therefore, our one hundred million people, in addition to speeding up production and contributing to the army, must also arm the entire people to defend the country. To arm the people, the first thing is to uphold the spirit of decisive battle. One hundred million people must be dedicated to their duties, and at the same time, they must have the awareness and recognition of victory, and overcome all difficulties. The government has previously decided on concrete measures to strengthen the domestic security posture. Everyone should also follow the above-mentioned principles, work hard to prepare for training, and further study emergency response measures. If we can achieve the defense of the country, we can ensure the local response.</p>
<p>Remember Reality and Rapidly Increase Production</p>
<p>Regarding the execution of public affairs, it is necessary to be rapid, accurately recognize the truth of the situation, guide public opinion, so that the lower situation can be reported to the higher authorities, implement national movements, and give full play to the greatest effect of immediate and rapid guidance. In particular, officials who are close to the people should be truly impartial to ensure the trust of the people and compatriots. The current situation has entered the next decisive battle. We should firmly remember the real environment and move towards the path of rapidly increasing production, strengthening combat power, and defending the country.</p>
<h3>Reports from Various Ministers</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) At the meeting of local governors held by the Japanese government on the 23rd, Agriculture and Commerce Minister Shimada gave many instructions on increasing food production.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Transportation Minister Maeda reported the situation of transportation construction at the meeting of local governors on the 23rd as follows: There has been significant progress in the construction of steel ships and wooden ships. Since this year, the construction of wooden ships has been particularly good. As for transportation construction related to railway transportation capacity, such as vehicles, lines, and staff, all efforts have been made to enhance it. Therefore, the transportation mobilization plan for this year has exceeded one and a half times the amount of freight transported in Showa 16 (Republic of China 30). And the cargo transferred from sea transportation to land transportation has exceeded one-third of its total transportation volume. In the future, the railway's transportation capacity will be constructed with existing materials, and it is hoped that the general public will tolerate the inconvenience of wartime transportation.</p>

<h3>Japanese Post-War Research Committee Announces Management Plan Yesterday Proposes Three Principles for Establishing a New Order</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese Post-War Research Committee decided on a post-war management plan at a meeting on the 18th, and on the 23rd, it issued a statement and published the full text of the plan. The main points of the statement are as follows: Judging from the experiences of the First World War and this World War, if the world's major powers are still bound by the principles of the old world order and repeatedly use their distant and close attacks, then the world's nations will never have peace, and human society will never have peace. The world's major powers all advocate freedom, equality, and justice, and base themselves on the results of their past centuries of aggression and conquest, and are diligent in strengthening their own nations, ignoring justice and humanity, using science and technology, killing each other, and destroying culture. In order to achieve their own ambitions, they do not hesitate to use any means. These principles of disrupting human peace and the old order can be summarized in the following three points: Advocating the survival of one's own nation while ignoring the survival of other nations. Acknowledging the defense of one's own nation while opposing the self-defense of other nations. Ensuring the self-sufficiency of one's own nation's economy while plundering the self-sufficiency of other countries' and nations' economies. Therefore, this committee advocates the following principles for establishing a new world order to ensure lasting world peace and to bring permanent peace to mankind: Eliminating the policy of mutual distant and close attacks among the world's nations, establishing a policy of good neighborliness and friendship, ensuring the survival of one's own nation, and respecting the survival of neighboring nations. Acknowledging the defense of one's own nation, respecting the defense of neighboring nations, and mutually establishing defense principles. Ensuring the self-sufficiency of one's own nation's economy, respecting the self-sufficiency of neighboring nations' economies, and establishing the principle of mutual assistance among neighboring nations. Based on the above principles, the world peace organization plan proposed by this committee is as follows: The world's nations, based on the above three principles, combine the major ethnic groups of Europe, East Asia, Oceania, North America, South America, and Africa. The ethnic group is a multi-ethnic group on the same continent with adjacent soils. The unit below it is an independent nation with a population of more than five million in the same region. The ethnic groups that constitute the ethnic group shall, with their mutual consent, convene to determine the leading ethnic group. The leading ethnic group is responsible for strengthening and establishing the three principles of good neighborliness and friendship, common defense, and economic mutual assistance among the ethnic group members. When disputes occur between ethnic groups that constitute the ethnic group, or when disputes occur between ethnic groups, they shall be resolved by the joint agreement of all ethnic groups other than the ethnic group concerned or the ethnic group concerned.</p>

<h3>Japan Establishes Domestic Posture Strengthening Aircraft and Other Production Announces Three Orders Mobilizing Officials, Students, Etc.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) As the world war situation approaches a decisive battle, Japan's important struggle is to thoroughly change the domestic posture in order to rapidly enhance combat power, especially the rapid increase in aircraft production. The former Army and Navy Ministers have stated that they require the correction of concentrated mobilization measures for materials and labor. In order to enable the country to concentrate material and human resources to cope with the decisive battle, the Japanese government announced on the 23rd the Student Labor Order, the Women's Volunteer Labor Order, and the Government Official Order, so as to strengthen military supplies production and aircraft production. At the meeting of local governors held on the same day, the government's policy of enhancing combat power was also elaborated, and the opinions of cabinet ministers were exchanged with this issue as the center. The domestic posture to cope with the decisive battle in the future will be gradually realized with the enhancement of combat power as the center, and new measures will be decided with the temporary parliament as the center.</p>
<h3>Official Mobilization Order Implemented from Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) In order to eliminate the shortage of technical personnel in important factories, the Japanese government intends to temporarily mobilize officials, technical personnel in various official and private experimental research institutes and official and private schools to cooperate in increasing the production of aircraft and other important military supplies. This plan was decided in the meeting on the 18th, and the rescue order was announced on the 20th as follows: In the Greater East Asia War, in order to urgently increase the production of aircraft and other important military supplies, the heads of various agencies may, when necessary, order their subordinate staff to temporarily engage in the urgent business of increasing the production of such items according to their instructions. This order shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Mobilization of School Principals, Teachers, and Students</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) Japan announced the "Student Labor Order" on the 23rd and implemented it immediately. The labor mobilization in the past was promoted in accordance with the "National Labor Patriotic Cooperation Association". The student labor mobilization has always been engaged in work in the capacity of students. This is based on the nature of labor and is labor for the purpose of education, which is different from the labor mobilization of the general national labor patriotic team. The main differences between this new law and the previous National Labor Patriotic Order are as follows: The period for which students continue to be dispatched for labor is clearly indicated as within one year. The targets of labor mobilization are expanded to students in the lower grades of secondary schools and students in the higher grades of national schools, and school principals and teachers are also targets of mobilization. When mobilizing students, the spirit of labor as education must be clearly indicated. Simplify the procedures for promoting student labor. In the event of special events, the labor of students who are ordered to be dispatched may be suspended. Entrust factory and other staff to undertake the task of guiding student labor</p>
<h3>Japan Formulates Women's Volunteer Labor Order</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) The Women's Volunteer Labor Order formulated by Japan this time is to transform the administrative guidance and encouragement of women's labor in the past into laws in order to promote it vigorously. This measure is actually the best way to break through the difficulties in today's situation where the male labor force that has been repeatedly called up and enlisted is insufficient. The following items in this order are noteworthy: The persons obligated to volunteer labor as stipulated in this order are those who are required to register in the National Occupational Capacity Middle Ad, that is, unmarried women aged 13 to under 40, but those who are for family life are not subject to this limit. As a principle of the labor period, when a team member's occupation is determined, the local governor shall issue a volunteer labor order document to the person. Those who do not comply with the Volunteer Labor Order may be forcibly ordered by the local governor to be dispatched to work. Violators shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not more than one year or a fine of not more than 1,000 yen.</p>
<h3>Japanese Scientific Authorities Provide Comprehensive Opinions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) In order to comprehensively mobilize the overall strength of scientific research and rapidly enhance combat power, the Japanese Academic Research Council compiled the opinions of 1,500 authorities on scientific research and submitted comprehensive opinions to the Army, Navy, and other related provinces on the 21st as follows: Regarding research in the operational field, researchers should directly participate in the research of tactics and weapons, and at the same time maintain close contact with the relevant authorities. Regarding research in the field of production enhancement, researchers should establish close contact with the maintenance department and the factory, and at the same time actively implement technical guidance and inspections. Regarding the mobilization of students with specialized skills, appropriate deployment should be made.</p>

<h3>Public Servants' Salary Rice: Distribution Soon, Management Committee Formally Established</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – To improve the living conditions of public servants in central government agencies, the central government has implemented a system of increased salaries and rice rations. Regarding the rice rations, a Central Government Agency Rice Ration Management Committee has been established to handle this matter specifically. The committee was formally established on the 7th of this month at the Executive Yuan. From July of this year, all public servants will receive a fixed amount of rice each month. This measure will not only directly improve the living standards of public servants but also indirectly promote administrative efficiency, which is of great significance. However, as more than a month has passed since the policy was announced, and the rice has not yet been distributed, there is much anticipation. The person in charge of the committee told reporters that the Rice Administration Association will distribute the rice on schedule, unlike the previous low-priced rice program, which was often delayed. One reason for the delay is the need to investigate and verify the number of personnel in each agency to prevent false reporting. This committee serves as a liaison between the central agencies in the capital and the Rice Administration Association, aiming to ensure the livelihood of public servants while preventing the waste of public funds. The committee is not directly responsible for the practical matters of rice procurement, transportation, and distribution. The committee only manages matters related to central civilian agencies and central party agencies. Military-related agencies have separate arrangements. Furthermore, after the establishment of the committee, specialists have been sent to Shanghai to discuss three important matters with the Rice Administration Association: The low-priced rice owed to various agencies by the Rice Administration Association in the past should be fully compensated for in August and should not be stopped under the pretext of establishing a rice ration system. Special rice rations, such as those for specially appointed officials and official residences, will still be the responsibility of the Rice Administration Association. The total amount of rice for July and August has been verified and confirmed, and the responsible agencies should be designated to distribute it promptly. To ensure that future rice rations are not delayed, it has been agreed to purchase the rice in bulk and designate warehouses for storage. It is reported that Vice Chairman Xi Zewen of the committee has largely agreed to the above-mentioned important matters, and they will be implemented separately upon his return to Nanjing soon.</p>
<h3>Restructuring and Establishment of the Nanjing Office</h3>

Minister Futatsu delivered a speech, followed by Mayor Zhou. The new personnel were then announced. The meeting concluded around 4 PM with a group photo.</p>
<h3>Establishment of a Procurement Guidance Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – To strengthen the rice procurement mechanism and prevent any irregularities, in addition to reorganizing the Nanjing branch of the Rice Administration Association, a Nanjing Area Rice Procurement Guidance Committee has been established as a guiding and supervisory body, jointly composed of representatives from relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies. The list of advisors and members of the committee is as follows: Advisors: Zhou Xuechang, Mayor of Nanjing Special Municipality; Li Yi, Director of the Police Supervisory Office; Yan Degui, Special Commissioner of the Sixth District; Tanaka Hikozō, Japanese Consul General in Nanjing.

<h3>Chongqing Secret Agents Arrested in Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Beijing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Since the activities of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force began, their reconnaissance activities have also started. The Japanese authorities in North China have also begun strict screening and reporting efforts. Recently, near Kaifeng, they arrested Yin Deyue (from Siyang, Jiangsu Province, 26 years old) and several other secret service agents belonging to the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Fifth War Zone. After rigorous interrogation, they were executed by military law on the 11th. Yin Deyue, under the secret orders of Hou Jingru of the 21st Division of the 92nd Army of the Chongqing forces, contacted a certain member of the Kaifeng Security Team. After infiltrating the Kaifeng area, he collaborated with a Mr. Zhao to investigate Japanese military deployments, airfield facilities, military supplies, and the sentiments of the people after the indiscriminate bombing by the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force. They reported this intelligence to the First and Fifth War Zones. On July 1, during the indiscriminate bombing of Xinxiang by the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, they were hiding in Xiaowang Village, 22 kilometers southwest of Kaifeng, when they were reported. According to the confessions of those arrested, the thorough identification of the entire spy ring will soon be realized.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Chongqing and Soviet Forces on Xinjiang Border</h3>
<p>Beiping, 23rd (Central News Agency) – In December of last year, an armed conflict occurred between Chongqing and Soviet forces on the northwestern border of China. At that time, the Soviet government issued a harsh statement, which caused a great reaction from Chongqing. According to information obtained locally, another military conflict has recently occurred in the border area north of Dihua in Xinjiang Province. In the autumn of the year before last, after Chongqing appeased Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, it ordered Yang Deting's 42nd Army, stationed in the Xingxing Gorge area on the border of Shaanxi and Gansu, to enter Xinjiang. Subsequently, a large number of troops were continuously dispatched to form a consolidated army, occupying key areas such as Hami and Dihua. Thus, Xinjiang Province gradually became a military zone controlled by the Central Army. In May of this year, the 42nd Army clashed with Soviet troops again in the border area north of Dihua, with extremely fierce fighting. It is rumored that the Soviet Air Force bombed the Dihua oil fields. The military relationship between the two sides, along with the progress of the Chongqing regime's northwestern operations, the shifts in the German-Soviet battle lines, and the expansion of bases by the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing towards the northwest, will inevitably become increasingly complex in the future.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting in Paris, German Troops Withdraw from Étampes, U.S. Troops Advancing Towards French-Spanish Border</h3>

British and Canadian forces are closely following the German troops and have reached a town one kilometer west of Lisieux (southeast of Caen), where fierce fighting is taking place, with heavy losses on both sides. Lisieux has been heavily damaged by bombing. The city contains the tomb of Saint Teresa, a Catholic holy site. The 20th Regiment of the U.S. Army launched an offensive from the east of Chartres (43 tons from Paris) and is advancing towards Nemours and Fontainebleau. In the Montreau area, after 15 hours of fierce fighting with the enemy, German troops withdrew from the city of Étampes (south of Paris). The enemy's tank attack on Aubeville was repelled. The 20th Regiment of the U.S. Army has a tank company, an infantry division, and a mechanized cavalry company.

<h3>After Japanese Troops Occupy Hengyang, Chongqing-U.S. Forces Suffer Heavy Blows, Minister Izubuchi Discusses the Situation in Hunan</h3>
<p>At the routine press conference held by the Army Press Department of Allied Japan in Shanghai yesterday (23rd) at 3 PM at the 8th floor of the Hua Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, Chinese journalists from this city were received. Minister Izubuchi himself attended, along with Trustee Akahoshi. Minister Izubuchi spoke about the dire situation of the Chongqing and U.S. air forces in Chongqing after the Japanese troops occupied Hengyang. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>State of Confusion Fully Exposed</h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi first stated that the occupation of Hengyang by Japanese troops had a significant impact on Chongqing and the United States, and the confused state they were in was increasingly evident in their words and actions. For example, enemy and U.S. media revealed that the fall of Hengyang meant that even if the U.S. forces captured Saipan Island, the effect would be zero. This time, Chiang Kai-shek, under pressure from the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing due to the fall of Hengyang, strictly ordered Xue Yue to retake Hengyang with about ten divisions. They are currently engaging in blind actions around Hengyang. The Japanese army will not tolerate the Chongqing army's actions and is continuing to suppress them to prevent them from taking any measures. Therefore, the Chongqing army has been unable to take any active offensive actions so far, only building fortifications and adopting a confrontational attitude. The Chongqing side is also paying special attention to Guilin, anticipating an imminent attack by the Japanese army, so the defense is very tight. It is reported that Chiang has dispatched senior generals to the area to plan the defense. At the same time, the Chongqing army has begun to destroy the Hunan-Guangxi railway and mobilize farmers to destroy the main roads leading to the interior. These actions show that the situation in Chongqing is extremely confused and panicked.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Lost Over 500</h3>
<p>The enemy U.S. Air Force in Chongqing suffered heavy blows in the battle for Hengyang but is still attempting to obstruct Japanese military operations, recklessly using its remaining forces to continuously attack peaceful areas and the Japanese mainland, including Northern Kyushu. This shows the final desperate actions of the enemy U.S. Air Force. The intended target area is still the Hunan battlefield. In addition, maritime routes in the Southeast China Sea and Japanese military vessels are also slightly obstructed. On the 20th and 21st of this month, before dawn, the enemy U.S. Air Force twice attacked the Japanese mainland. It is reported that the aircraft mobilized for these two attacks were the entire force of the 20th Air Force, using B-29 bombers, each carrying 12 to 15 airmen. During these attacks, they achieved nothing and lost 23 aircraft to Japanese forces. If we calculate 12 people per aircraft, the enemy U.S. forces suffered 276 airmen deaths. The Japanese side only lost three fighter planes and three airmen. The difference in losses between Japan and the U.S. is incomparable, indicating the heavy losses suffered by the enemy U.S. forces. At the same time, the Japanese air force is constantly active to destroy the remaining forces of the enemy U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. Recently, from the 11th to the 17th of this month, the air force continuously attacked airfield bases in Xi'an, Hanzhong, Liangshan, Liuzhou, Guilin, Jian'ou, and other places, destroying or setting fire to more than 50 enemy aircraft. Since the start of this operation, the total number of enemy aircraft shot down by the Japanese air force is 520.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Conceals Defeat in Hengyang</h3>
<p>Minister Izubuchi also pointed out that Major General Zeng Qing, the military spokesman for Chongqing, made extremely clumsy statements when meeting with reporters on the 18th of this month regarding the losses of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang campaign. Regarding the main content, he stated that the total casualties of the Chongqing army in the Hengyang defense battle amounted to 15,000, and the losses before the fall of Hengyang were the same, totaling 30,000. However, on the last day, only 2,000 of the Chongqing army remained in the city of Hengyang. This figure is false and inaccurate. When the Japanese army occupied Hengyang, it captured 13,300 men under the command of Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army. Based on this figure, the Chongqing military spokesman clearly concealed the defeat and made false reports. He did not mention the 11,300 prisoners in addition to the 2,000 men. This demonstrates irresponsibility and a lack of concern for military dependents, as well as an attitude of abandonment. In contrast, Japan is most concerned about the soldiers in mainland China and the Chinese people. The Japanese government has repeatedly stated that the target of the operations in mainland China is not the Chongqing army but to eliminate the aggressive forces of the enemy United States. If the enemy U.S. forces in China are completely expelled and wiped out, the current brutal warfare in mainland China can be avoided, and the people can be spared the disasters of war. Minister Izubuchi concluded that the Chongqing regime should bear considerable responsibility for the war on the mainland. The character of the Chongqing regime is no different from that of the treacherous Batres regime, but the current environment of Chongqing is entirely controlled by Britain and the United States.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Food Control, Cracking Down on Flour Movement, Enforcement by Economic Security Office</h3>
<p>Recently, citizens of this city have violated regulations regarding the movement of flour, resulting in the confiscation of flour carried on their shoulders that exceeded the limits. A reporter interviewed Sun Baoli, chairman of the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, who stated that the government is strengthening food control to stabilize people's livelihoods, so the regulations on restricting movement are quite detailed. However, some citizens still do not understand the meaning of control and carry flour to Shanghai for sale, disrupting the control policy. The Municipal Government's Goods Distribution Office and Economic Security Office, to assist the committee in completing the control work, have jointly agreed on measures. The Shanghai Area Flour Distribution Office drafted rules for handling movement and announced them for implementation, and the Economic Security Office is responsible for enforcing the ban on movement. The committee also sends personnel to assist in the inspection. As for the power to enforce penalties, it concerns police administration and naturally belongs entirely to the Economic Security Office.</p>
<h3>Citizens Sinking Wells Should Carefully Select Locations to Avoid Damaging Underground Public Facilities</h3>
<p>Water usage in this city has been restricted, as the China Water and Electricity Company has adopted wartime measures, conserving both water and electricity by limiting the amount of water supplied and the time it is available. This has caused inconvenience for citizens, so many have dug their own artesian wells to use the water. Various Baojia authorities have also automatically dug wells to provide for civilian use and to cope with emergencies. Regarding this issue, a reporter inquired with the relevant authorities, who stated that citizens are free to dig artesian wells, but they must carefully select suitable locations and hire experts to design and dig the wells to avoid damaging various underground public facilities. It is roughly stated that today (the 21st) is the 10th anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Under the leadership of Leader Chiang Tra Bose, we have moved towards our motherland India. You all understand that this war is not only to liberate our country and fight for freedom but also to achieve the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Our army, in cooperation with the army of Allied Japan, is advancing towards Delhi for this purpose. Then, Captain Naren, commander of the Indian National Army training camp, spoke, followed by free donations from Indian overseas Chinese. It was recorded that 123,000 yuan was collected that day.</p>
<h3>Special Flour Rationing to be Restored</h3>
<p>Regarding the continued rationing of special flour in this city, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office has decided to restore it on a fixed date. Recently, they convened a meeting with representatives from the local dim sum, flour dough, canned goods, cut noodles, steamed buns, tea snacks, tea food store, wine and dishes, and fried dough sticks industries. Representatives from the Municipal Flour Distribution Office also attended. Chairman Futa Toshiro briefly stated that special flour rationing would be restored soon and hoped that the various associations would promptly prepare membership lists for verification. He also hoped that the industries would adhere to the flour price as the standard for the price of retail flour products and not exceed it, lest they face suspension of rationing.</p>
<h3>Permit Issuance Office Inside Rice Administration Association Closed</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Committee, based on the "Essential Measures for Emergency Rice Supply in Nanjing and Shanghai," previously established application and permit issuance procedures for moving rice, In addition to twelve permit issuance offices, the association also processed permit issuance. The validity period for the rice movement certificate was set to seven days, and the certificate issued by the permit offices was valid for only one day. It is learned that the application and permit issuance within the association has been discontinued since yesterday (23rd). Citizens who wish to apply for certificates should go to the nearest permit issuance office, and all certificates issued will be valid for one day.</p>
<h3>Crime Prevention Authorities Hope Doctors Respect Medical Ethics</h3>
<p>Regarding the fact that various public and private hospitals in this city often disregard poor patients, the Judicial Office of the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered strict correction. According to Chief Shi of the Crime Prevention Section, some traditional Chinese medicine doctors also engage in similar practices. When treating patients, they have a registration system but also offer "premium registration" and "special registration" categories, using these as excuses to charge higher consultation fees, benefiting wealthy individuals while delaying treatment for poor patients, even if their condition is serious. This is not permissible in law or morality. Therefore, strict investigation has been ordered. In short, it is hoped that doctors and physicians will respect medical ethics, treating the illness and not the money. They should first observe the patient's condition and prioritize treatment for severe cases.</p>
<h3>Celebration Held by Indian Overseas Chinese in this City</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League held a meeting at the racetrack at 4 PM on the 21st to celebrate the anniversary of the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Chairman Quet presided over the meeting. After performing the rituals and singing the Indian national anthem, Quet delivered a speech,</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Takes Over Factory Survey</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau announced that the factory survey work, previously handled by the First District Industrial Survey Office, will now be handled by the Fourth Section of the bureau, as the office has been abolished. The worker technical training class, previously run by the Industrial Survey Office, will now be continued by the bureau and is scheduled to start on the first of next month. Many major factories in the city have recommended employees to enroll.</p>
<h3>Goods Distribution Office Relocates</h3>
<p>After its establishment, the Municipal Goods Distribution Office was temporarily located at the former Economic Office on Jiangxi Road. However, it has moved entirely to the former Eighth District Government Office on Taishan Road since yesterday. It is rumored that the Municipal Government will convert the former site on Jiangxi Road into offices for the Secretariat and Document Section.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Hopes Citizens Report Extra Fees Charged When Renewing Bicycle Licenses</h3>
<p>According to a report in the Shanghai Evening News on the 21st of this month, citizens must pay an extra tens of yuan when renewing their bicycle licenses to obtain a new license, otherwise, they will have to wait for a long time. The person in charge of the Public Utilities Bureau made a statement, saying that the bureau had sent a written reply to the newspaper (original text recorded separately).</p>
<h3>Fixed Fees</h3>
<p>When renewing bicycle licenses, citizens only need to pay the following fees: application fee of 30 yuan, donation fee of 45 yuan, license fee of 10 yuan, stamp fee of 2 yuan. As for the donation plate fee, because the Finance Office has already produced it, the price is 15 yuan. For areas other than the former first and eighth districts, because the Finance Office set a higher price, it is 22 yuan. In total, the registration fee at the Jiangning Road, Gongping Road, and Lujiawan vehicle registration offices is 102 yuan, and 109 yuan for other districts. All fees should be paid to the Finance Office office within the registration office. Citizens should pay attention and not pay extra fees. If there are any cases of extortion or extra charges, please cooperate with this bureau to report them. If there is solid evidence, severe punishment will be imposed.</p>
<p>To the editor of the Shanghai Evening News: I have read your newspaper's news about the bicycle license irregularities on the 21st of this month, which concerns the responsibilities of this bureau. Therefore, I am making a sincere and responsible reply.</p>

<h3>Da Zhong Society Sponsors Scholarship</h3>
<p>The three-act comedy "Great Talent" directed by Han Muni, head of the Da Zhong Drama Society, will be presented at 3 PM today (24th) at the Xianxin Grand Theater. More than 20 male and female performers will participate, and their acting skills are all superb, promising a special performance.

Anyone who donates 500 yuan or more will receive a free ticket. Donate more and receive more tickets. Drama lovers, don't miss out.</p>
<h3>Saving Tea Refreshments to Donate to Scholarship</h3>
<p>Mr. Ren Xiaoshan, Chairman of Jiu Yu Tea Company, Standing Director Song Qifan, Ye Shichang, Yao Zhongba, and Hu Yezhi, said in a letter: "We are writing to inform you that our company has moved to a new location. In addition to donating all the cash gifts received to the Xinwenbao News Agency for student loans, we are also specially saving 50,000 yuan from tea refreshments to send to your newspaper for scholarship funds, to express our sincere intentions." Also, the Jinmen Grand Hotel, Bailu Pavilion, coffee shop's opening ceremony donated 20,000 yuan to scholarship funds, which is very meaningful and admirable.</p>
<h3>Commendable Enthusiasm of Bread and Steamed Bun Colleagues</h3>
<p>"We, the colleagues in the bread and steamed bun trade, are all laborers. We rarely hold separate ancestral sacrifices due to limited resources. Therefore, every Ghost Festival, colleagues initiate Buddhist rituals, which can be considered 'collective ancestral veneration.' Now, colleagues, moved by the importance of 'scholarship aid' advocated by the newspaper, besides holding a simple ceremony, are donating the equivalent of 10,000 yuan in burnt paper ash savings, specifically presented to be used for beneficial scholarship aid. We know that a cup of water cannot fill a cart, but if everyone can adopt the principle of 'turning burnt paper ash into banknotes' to expand scholarship aid, then little strokes fell great oaks. We hope our initiative to inspire others will have profound results!" Additionally, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association's painting hall donated 25,000 yuan in the name of the owner of Lezhai Studio. The Silk Trade Association's retail joint benefit group, Liang Yi Ji, each donated 10,000 yuan. Dahua Automobile Easy Exchange Company raised 10,000 yuan. The goodwill is deeply appreciated.</p>

Total stored notes received: 156,420 yuan. Remaining balance: 15,031,978 yuan.</p>
<h3>Possible Misconduct</h3>
<p>It is very possible for officials handling affairs to engage in misconduct due to external enticements and internal chaos. The bureau has made great efforts to prevent and minimize this. In the past three months, more than twenty personnel have been dismissed for this reason.</p>
<h3>Public Indifference</h3>
<p>The procedures for inspecting bicycles and the conditions required for bicycle licenses are extremely simple and clear. However, it is entirely due to public indifference and collusion that the staff handling these matters can still cheat. According to the facts of the bureau's past four years, few citizens have ever made positive reports or proposed effective measures to stop this phenomenon.</p>
<h3>Absolutely No Cover-Up</h3>
<p>The bureau can absolutely and responsibly declare that it will never cover up the corrupt actions of its employees or conceal their corrupt acts. If the bureau receives a report from any citizen, whether true or not, it will immediately conduct a thorough investigation. After the investigation, appropriate penalties will be imposed. At the same time, the bureau welcomes criticisms or suggestions from the media.</p>
<h3>Public Cooperation</h3>
<p>Each vehicle registration office of the bureau clearly displays the fees. If the fees charged exceed this amount, citizens can refuse to pay and should refuse to pay. Furthermore, they should detain the personnel involved and send them to the bureau for investigation, or record the time, location, and appearance of the personnel and report them to the bureau for effective action. In short, regardless of anything else, the cooperation of the public is essential for eliminating corruption. Without it, there will be no success.</p>
<h3>New Licenses Required</h3>
<p>The bureau believes it is extremely inappropriate for readers of your newspaper to continue using old licenses when they cannot obtain new ones, waiting for police intervention before explaining. There is no reason why a new license cannot be obtained. Traffic administration falls under the jurisdiction of the bureau, not the police.</p>
<p>The bureau solemnly declares this and at the same time requests the public's attention: No employee of the Public Utilities Bureau can collect any fees from citizens, as all administrative revenue is handled entirely by the Finance Bureau. The Public Utilities Bureau is responsible only for vehicle inspection and registration and does not directly collect fees. We hope that your newspaper will provide appropriate guidance on the bureau's traffic management measures and personnel administration. Shanghai Special Municipality Public Utilities Bureau, August 23, 1943.</p>
<h3>Excellent Results in This Year's Epidemic Prevention Work</h3>
<p>The cholera prevention work in the city in the 33rd year of the Republic of China was carried out by the city government, which organized the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee in accordance with the regulations of the Central Epidemic Prevention Committee. The committee resolved to implement the cholera prevention work plan, which was conscientiously implemented by the Municipal Health Bureau and the former Health Department of the First District Office. Since its commencement on May 1, the results have been excellent. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Director Yuan of the Municipal New Life Bureau to understand the wide-ranging epidemic prevention situation this year. Director Yuan made the following remarks:</p>
<h3>Director's Remarks</h3>
<p>Under the guidance and cooperation of the Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, this bureau has diligently carried out epidemic prevention measures, first focusing on poor shantytowns and gradually extending to residents of various baojia and passengers traveling through the northwest railway stations. The first phase of universal injection was implemented. At the same time, dozens of mobile injection teams were organized to go to various transportation hubs to inject passersby. By the end of July, more than three million citizens in Shanghai had received the first phase of injection. The second phase of cholera prevention injection began on August 1, coinciding with the merger of the municipal government and the First District Office. Administration has been unified, and the original scales and systems of the former one or two districts have been adopted with the best features selected, making all epidemic prevention facilities even more convenient. The Health Bureau continues to intensify efforts in accordance with the previous phase's methods. Anyone who received the first phase of vaccination in May or June must continue to receive the second phase of vaccination this month to be effective. Those who received the first phase of injection in July must continue to receive the second phase of injection no later than the beginning of next month to avoid ineffectiveness. The second phase has been underway for only about two weeks, and more than 500,000 people have already been injected, with the situation being quite good. In addition to injecting preventive vaccines, the Health Bureau has also dispatched inspectors to various locations to inspect various restaurants and inns, setting up about 1,000 beds, which is sufficient for use. In addition, various epidemic hospitals can accommodate thousands of patients. As for chemical tests and various drugs, sufficient preparations have also been made. Even the issue of traffic blockade after the outbreak of cholera has been carefully planned.</p>

<h3>Public Response Regarding News Vendors' Black Market Price Gouging</h3>
<p>Recently, this newspaper has frequently received letters from readers reporting that news vendors are not charging the prescribed fees and are excessively raising prices, creating a black market for newspapers, which is extremely deplorable. This newspaper is currently studying ways to thoroughly crack down on this practice and will implement them soon. We cannot respond to each letter individually, but we hope the public will understand. Sincerely, Shen Bao Publishing Company.</p>
<h3>Sacrificing China to Fulfill American Imperialist Ambitions Minister Matsushima Hopes Chongqing Side Will Wake Up Soon</h3>
<p>American warplanes have been attacking Japanese territory, using the Chongqing area as a base, increasingly exposing their intentions for war against Japan. Furthermore, they are not only using China as a bombing base but also dispatching army troops to Chongqing, intending to thoroughly exploit Chongqing, sacrificing it to fulfill their ambition to oppress Asia. Naval Captain Matsushima, the press officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, met with reporters from the Continental News on the 22nd to criticize American evil desires without any pretense, expose the weakness of American air raids on Japan, and dissect the current situation of Chongqing, caught between the anti-Japanese banner and the invading forces of the United States and Britain. He stated that now is precisely the opportunity for Chongqing to awaken and that they must not hesitate any longer. His words were as follows:</p>
<h3>Chongqing Adopts the Policy of Using Barbarians to Control Barbarians</h3>
<p>The issue that Chongqing has advocated for many years is the independence of Chinese sovereignty and the integrity of its territory. However, conflicts have repeatedly occurred between the US military stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing army, and the Chinese people have a great aversion to the overbearing behavior of US military personnel stationed in Chongqing. It has recently been reported that in Guilin and other areas, hasty incidents of burning and beating, riots, etc., have occurred. The fundamental idea is that China is the land of the Chinese people. Therefore, the Chongqing authorities have also adopted the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians, while also deeply feeling the contradiction. Up to now, they have been extremely wary of the invasion of China by the American and British armies. Now, due to the unbearable loss of Hengyang and other current predicaments, as a result, Zhang Pingqun, a counselor of the Chongqing Executive Yuan, and Liang Hancao, the Minister of Propaganda, and others publicly expressed their welcome to the early arrival of the British and American forces in Chongqing.</p>
<h3>If You Do Not Wake Up from Your Delusion, It May Be Too Late to Regret</h3>
<p>Of course, this trend is because the United States and Britain, from India and the Pacific, are aiming at Chinese territory, disregarding its sovereignty, and trying to plunge all of China into the flames of war like Italy, involving all the Chinese people in a fierce modern job, sacrificing them to achieve the ambitions of the United States and Britain. This attempt is extremely obvious. If Chongqing continues to adhere to its long-standing policy at this time, if it does not hesitate to sacrifice its own people, then the policy of using barbarians to control barbarians will be used by the United States. This fact will cause some Chinese people to mistakenly believe the delusion that the American and British forces will return home in peacetime, completely shattering it. During this period, it will be too late for Chongqing to regret, and they will inevitably suffer endlessly. What the people of Chongqing should consider is this point.</p>
<h3>The Four-Power Talks Are Bizarre and Complex</h3>
<p>Also to be considered in conjunction is the post-war peace conference held by representatives of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in Washington on the 21st. The purpose of holding this meeting at a time when the war is fierce is to unite the allied forces against the Axis powers so as to propagandize to neutral countries. In particular, the United States wants to obtain in advance the substance of the Soviet Union's economic and police policies after the war. This ambition is also very obvious. Moreover, the Chongqing representative was excluded from this meeting, and the same meeting scheduled to be held in September will only be a meeting between the United States, Britain, and Chongqing. From this point of view, the complex and bizarre relationship between the four has been exposed. On the one hand, the evidence that Chongqing is being disdained by the United States and Britain can be clearly understood here.</p>
<h3>The American Imperialist Ambitions Are Barely Veiled</h3>
<p>Furthermore, Roosevelt, after inspecting the Pacific Ocean, stated: The United States should ensure the communication route connecting the Aleutians, Siberia, the Far East, and China. Or, considering the fact that the United States stated that it should occupy all the islands north of the equator and south of 30 degrees north latitude, it can be seen that the United States will brazenly reveal its ambitions at the peace conference. If the United States and Britain are still left on the earth after the end of the war, then a more tragic dark age of the survival of the fittest will appear. From this point of view, we are eagerly looking forward to the unanimous awakening and rising of the people of Chongqing, and we must resolutely strengthen and solidify the belief in victory in this job.</p>
<h3>Fuhua Cup Mini-Soccer Tournament: Baima vs. Anhua, Another Match: Hequn vs. German Business</h3>
<p>The Fuhua Cup Mini-Soccer League will have two matches today starting at 5:00 PM at the Donghua Stadium on Daxing Road. Admission is free and spectators are welcome.

Players such as Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, Li Yao, and Zhang Banglun, in addition to the Donghua lineup, have also gained the participation of Yan Shixin. Anhua is not considered weak, but it may be difficult to blunt its edge against Baima. The second match is between Hequn and German Business. Hequn is the highest-rated team in the Huaniu Championship. German Business has northern European players such as Fuen Pantoson, and its combat power is strong. If Hequn wins, the championship is in their hands. If they unfortunately lose, they still have one last battle with Huanan. Today's schedule is as follows: Baima - Anhua (Fu Group) 5:00 PM, Heyi - German Business (Qun Group) 6:10 PM.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality Goods Allocation Office</h3>

<h3>National Forum: The Issue of Issuing Tax Stamps for Consumption Special Taxes</h3>
<p>— Fei Zhaoan</p>
<p>The consumption tax bribery case has already aroused city-wide concern. In addition to investigating the matter fairly and thoroughly, the authorities should also actively improve the overall plan and devise appropriate countermeasures. Looking back, the special tax office's collection personnel in the past were prone to corruption, making direct control and supervision difficult. Large amounts of tax revenue went into private pockets, greatly affecting fiscal revenue. According to the case, the bribery originated during the collection of tax payments; therefore, in the future, there is a need for practical reforms in the procedures for both collection and taxpayers.</p>
<p>Tax revenue needs to be rectified to prevent special taxes from recurring bribery and to reduce tax evasion; the simpler and more open the procedures, the better. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate to use the example of the stamp tax ticketing system, issuing the value of special consumption tax tickets, requiring merchants to affix special tax tickets based on the value when selling goods, just like affixing stamp tax tickets. This would make it impossible for taxpayers to evade donations, eliminate opportunities for cheating and tax evasion, and prevent released personnel from resuming their old tricks. The method is fully open, taxpayers are completely aware, those who handle the money have no way to conceal it, and the procedures are clear and simple, making it impossible for handlers to try to be clever and cheat. Special tax tickets are of great benefit to the increase of tax revenue and the elimination of bribery cases in the future, and the issuance of special consumption tax tickets is worth considering for its importance.</p>
<h3>Social Service: Epidemic Prevention Injectors Should Pay Attention to Needle Disinfection</h3>
<p>Epidemic prevention injections began on August 1st. Epidemic prevention workers and baojia epidemic prevention teams are intensifying their work to prevent epidemics for citizens. However, I have seen injectors in several places using syringes (10c.c. or 2c.c.) to draw vaccine, attach needles, and continuously inject more than a dozen people without disinfection, stopping only after finishing the injection. Some even repeatedly use the same needle and syringe from beginning to end without disinfection, causing informed people to view this with fear and avoid injection.</p>
<p>Human blood often contains latent pathogens, such as Spirochaeta pallida (the syphilis spirochete) and Plasmodium malariae (the malaria protozoan). Such patients appear normal on the outside and are not easily detected. However, if a needle comes into contact with blood containing these pathogens and is injected into someone else without disinfection, there is a risk of transmission.</p>
<p>There are many syphilis patients in Shanghai. Once transmitted, they harm future generations and are a major enemy of national health. Therefore, please pay attention to the epidemic prevention injectors. Each needle must be disinfected before use, and after use, it must never be used a second time without disinfection. Under sterile operation, syringes may be used until the bacterial vaccine is used up, but they must not be used again without disinfection. As for disinfection methods, wiping needles with alcohol or iodine cannot be considered thorough disinfection. Only boiling disinfection can kill all non-spore bacilli. Even the spores of Bacillus anthracis, which have the strongest resistance, can be killed within tens of minutes, which is safe and reliable.</p>
<p>If the injection personnel want to save time, they can imitate the First District Health Department by using hundreds of needles and dozens of pairs, and then gather the used needles and syringes for boiling. This saves time and avoids future troubles, which is a good method and worthy of emulation. As this concerns the health of the public, please pay attention to it at the Bureau. (Zhou Fuyu)</p>
<h3>Schools and Scholarships</h3>
<p>The Dinghai natives in Shanghai recently established two primary schools for Dinghai natives in Shanghai. The first school is located at 111A Jinan Road (formerly Pingjili Road) inside the Dinghai Association, and the second is located inside the Dinghai Philanthropic Association on Shanghai South Xinjiao Road. Both schools have spacious buildings and are of a non-profit nature, enrolling boys and girls of all nationalities. The expenses are all raised by Dinghai natives in Shanghai. People like Zhou Sanyuan, Qian Lijun, Shao Dashi, Xu Wenze, Xia Caigui, Huang Tieming, Shen Yangyuan, Chen Yiting, Ding Zihua, Chen Shushi, Wu Renbao, Chen Shoulun, Gan Doufu, Lin Yibin, Zhu Zikui, Qiu Guozhen, Ma Zhongda, etc., have all generously donated large sums of money, which have accumulated to a considerable amount, and they plan to establish a school fund. The position of principal is temporarily held concurrently by Zhang Shicun, the head of the school affairs of the natives' association. The teachers and staff hired are all graduates of universities, high schools, and normal schools, and have an interest in education.</p>
<p>The Private Shizhong Primary School at the intersection of North Hai Road and Tibet Road in Yuequnfang was founded by Liu Heming, a senior in the education field. It is one of the oldest primary schools in Shanghai, with complete facilities and dedicated teaching. It has long enjoyed a good reputation in society. Currently, the principal of the school, Liu Wenhuang (son of Mr. Heming), recognizing the large number of middle school students dropping out of school due to the endless surge in prices, which will have adverse consequences for society, is preparing to establish Shizhong Obligation Middle School, offering free enrollment to provide impoverished young people with the opportunity to study and to gain equal rights in their future development. It is said that preparations are almost complete and enrollment will begin soon.</p>
<p>Cuiguang Primary School offers full tuition waivers for ten students, half tuition waivers for twenty students, and one-quarter tuition waivers for forty students. If the number exceeds the above, preferential treatment may still be given depending on the circumstances. The school's expenses have always been the responsibility of the board of directors to raise. School address: 143 Remi Road. The school will open in ten days.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA will be opening the Sanhe Primary School at 23 Sanhe Li, Xiaoshadu Haifang Road this year. Tuition is only half of that of general schools in Shanghai. Classes are held all day, from grades one to six. Each grade will enroll 50 new students. Those from truly impoverished families may have their tuition waived entirely. A brochure is available for collection at the school.</p>
<p>Wu Quannian, National Physician, Offers Preferential Treatment to Students. Mr. Wu Quannian, a national physician at Tianyuantang National Medicine Store, 657 South Malang Road, has always been committed to serving society and benefiting patients. In order to offer preferential treatment to poor students, anyone seeking medical treatment with a scholarship or loan certificate will be given free service, limited to ten people per day, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. For serious illnesses where transportation is difficult, free house calls can also be made, but due to time constraints, this is limited to three people per day.</p>
<p>Physician Wu Keqian Offers Free Consultations. Physician Wu Keqian, in order to alleviate the burden on patients, will offer consultations free of charge from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every afternoon, starting from today, at the Laotongchun Drug Store on the west end of Chongqing Road on Da Shanghai Road. He specializes in internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, and other departments, without charging consultation fees. He has also agreed with Mr. Yan Dexin, the owner of the drug store, that prescriptions can be filled at half price (house calls are the same).</p>
<p>Music Appreciation Society. The private Shanghai Jinle Conservatory of Music is offering a music appreciation class, with each term lasting two months. Classes are held once a week, on Saturday afternoons or Sunday mornings. During class, records are played and experts are invited to perform world-famous musical pieces. Professor Yang Jiaren of the school will provide explanations and guidance on appreciation methods. All middle school students and those with a middle school education or higher who love music are welcome to register. Brochures can be obtained in person at the school at 386 West Aihams Road.</p>
<p>The Jinxiu Amateur Night School on the second floor of the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road, in order to cultivate new talent in banking accounting, has specially established an advanced banking accounting course for the autumn semester.</p>
<p>The Hujiang Girls' High School is organized by female alumni of Hujiang University. This semester, there is extra classroom space in each grade of junior and senior high school. Therefore, two more classes have been added, and fifty free and half-fee students will be recruited for the first grade of junior and senior high school, respectively, in order to cultivate outstanding students from impoverished backgrounds. School address: 4th Floor, Cishu Building, Nanjing Road.</p>

<h3>Long-Held Wish (8) — Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Toyoo Ishida, Translated by Yang</p>
<p>Ryuo opened all the windows of the room he had locked for a long time. He hastily opened Makoto’s letter. He even forgot the weariness of the journey, feeling his heart pounding, carefully reading the letter word by word.</p>
<p>The letter seemed to be written on Makoto's first night after moving out of the dormitory.</p>
<p>"Due to a mission, I am temporarily leaving Kure Port, but the situation requires me to avoid sending telegrams to Kagoshima, so I may have made you come for nothing, I am truly sorry!"—This was the opening of the letter.</p>
<p>"But, Ryuo, you should be happy! A few days after you went home, I happened to meet Lieutenant Commander Tobita at the Suikosha. You might not remember the Lieutenant Commander Tobita I'm talking about right away. Even I, who am in the same organization, only knew him when I happened to meet him.</p>
<p>Ryuo! Do you remember when we were in the third grade of junior high school, Lieutenant Colonel Kikuchi led us to visit Etajima? Wasn't it the duty officer in white uniform who gave us a lecture at the time? You and I were very moved by that lecture, and we often mentioned it afterwards. That high-ranking officer was Lieutenant Commander Tobita. He seemed to be a lieutenant at the time.</p>
<p>As soon as I saw the lieutenant commander's face, I immediately remembered him and reported the situation at the time to him. Then the lieutenant commander also remembered, because eight naval officers came out of the middle school students at that time, and he himself was very happy.</p>
<p>Later, when I asked the lieutenant commander about his current position, he gave me a business card. Looking at it, the title said Navy Press Department. He serves in the department and is said to have come to Kure Town for some kind of job.</p>
<p>I happened to think of your long-held wish, so I thought this was the best opportunity. So I told him that you were also one of the middle school students at the time, more enthusiastic about the navy than anyone else, but unfortunately you failed the physical examination and became a naval painter, forgetting the navy. I told him everything in detail.</p>
<p>The lieutenant commander was not only very sympathetic to you, but also mentioned the story of winning the Minister of the Navy's award. He also said, "So it was him, I know his name."</p>
<p>Therefore, I told him even more that you need naval knowledge and have great hopes. Then, the lieutenant commander really wants to meet you. Hearing this made me jump for joy. Soldiers generally don't say that.</p>
<p>Ryuo! Such a good opportunity is not easy to come by. Take my letter of introduction and be sure to visit the lieutenant commander in the department. By all means, I will notify you as soon as there is an opportunity. Well, goodbye! Please take care of yourself! (135)"</p>
