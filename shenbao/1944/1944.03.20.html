<p>社評</p>
<h3>後胡槍決以後</h3>
<p>這次政府對於軍糧舞弊案犯后一　胡政先加槍決，在國民觀念上，確是一件振奮人心的大事。在政府信譽上，確是一件樹立聲　的大事。然而，澄清　治，嚴肅官常，是整個的，是經常的。如果爲了一時環境，而對某一案件作局部的處置，則於整個官常的肅正，還是不能澈底的，所得者不過一時的刺激而已。所以，后胡處決，是澄清吏治，嚴肅官常的開端，從而普及於整個官場的澄</p>
<p>過去，政府對於澄淸丈治，頒布很多法令條例，先以去年五月及十月間，公布的實施囤積主要商品　罪暫行條例，及公務員犯誠治罪條例，更為具體，前者雖非專指官吏，但政府訪止官而商，商而官者從事囤積，於澄清吏治，雖有意思表示，而一般高中級官吏，貪污犯　如故。爲什麽這輩貪污官吏，竟敢弁　法紀而以身試法呢？原因是很簡單的，巾於政府並無決心執行法令而已。傳聞前年十二月間，監察院委員馬孟莊，呂一峯，趙式鈺等，會聯名彈劾糧食部當局，當然提出證據，而其結果，不但被彈劾的糧部當局未受懲處，而提出彈刻的監察委員反受免職處分。於是監察院的職權機能，從此消失，貪汚而有辦法者從此益見囂張。値到現在，才知這幾位監察委員的盡職與勇敢。又如去年四月間，政府指派大員陳之碩等澈查滬市大規模囤積投機案件，結果不但從了大魚，即小魚亦無下落。由於貪污中有了大官的親戚同　故舊，或其他密切關係，或牽連大多，於是就殉情枉法，此路不通。結果法令自法令，貪污自貪污。所以，政府荀無決心，則條文，談話，訓詞，都是不切實際的門面而巳。</p>
<p>這次后胡案件，政府是具有決心了。可是，經過盟邦日本憲兵部隊的檢舉，無疑的還是促成決心的要素。然而，慢說別的貪汚大案，就以這次案件而論，后胡還是小漁，尤其希望這回再不要捉了小魚，而縱了大魚。我們在十四日社評中已經指出糧食部最高官吏的責任。現在還可注意者，顧　衡是中央糧食部長，后大椿是江蘇省糧食局長，隸屬關係的歷任主管長官都負有連帶責任，當然也有偵查的必要，不涉嫌者固屬無與，確涉嫌者又將如何？</p>
<p>政府有無修明政治的決心，端視有無澄清史治整個的決心；政府有無澄清吏治整個的決心，端視有無澈底查辦這次軍糧舞弊案的決心·同時，整個的決心澄情吏治，第一，今後應由政府本身自己繼續檢舉貧汚。除非說整個官塲中，只此軍糧舞弊案以外，就亦為防止貧汚之一途。第三，監察與司法職能，應給予獨立發揮的自由，克盡檢舉與偵查之使命。第四，調整公務員待遇，防止產生貧汚的原因。</p>
<h3>日決戰非常措置具體案逐步實施　昂揚戰意向勝利之途邁進</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本政府於上月二十五日閣議中決定決戰非常措置要　後，關於具體實施方案之成案亦大體制定而逐次開始實施，迄今　有停止高　　樂具體要　等十二件之公佈與實施，而開始向決勝之途　進。同時與此　行者，為昂　戰意增強生產確保食糧及確立防衛國土之能勢起見，要發起政府大政　贊會　　政治會三者打成一　之　民　關起運動，並已決定中央　絡本部之委員三十三人，於十八日召開第一次會議後，　農　續極之運動·於一周間為運應戰局，內政方面亦會有　著之活潑，如日政府於十四日之　議決定旅客運輸限　案，　又於十八日之　議决定女子挺身隊制度强化方策要綱，及動勞昻揚方策要　二案。關於第一之限制旅客運輸，目的在於迅速強化以增強壓力與防空　　人口為重　之運輸力，故除學生之上學及職員之上班外一般旅行將加以澈底之限制。關於第二之強化女子挺身隊制度方策，目的在於強化女子之加入挺身　，而使其　　　向一增強壓力之生產方面，故凡滿十二歲以上四十歲以下之獨身女子，或依職業之不同，或依地獨身女子應時局之要請，基於愛國心而自發的協力勤勞工作，其性質與一般之徽用　異。關於第三之勤勞勗揚方策，轉使軍隊式之組織通用於工廠組織，其目的在為明瞭責任之歸趨，俾急速提高工業廠之勤勞能率故今後將積極謀勗揚勤勞淸神，整個勤勞體制，徹底實行敎育訓練刷新勤勞管理等·按於工廠實施軍隊式之統率方式，一部工廠早巳開始，成績頗為良好，故日政府此次乃採此搭置，而欲擴大進入而實施之。關於上述之非常措置，國民無不協刀，自不難期獲十全之實效，因之　貿會　政會與政府以積極圖謀展開國民總崛起運動，實可謂為得當之措置。决戰措置要　之中未具饞化者，尚有　禁止製造品目之擴大與規格之統一·　平時畏期計劃事務及事業之停止·　中央監督事務之移讓地方等多項問題。於此决職非常措置要綱，即將全部踏上實踐之途，如上所述日本刻正舉全力使一切戰力化，為準備不久之將來開始總反攻，而整備一年之决戰態勢，一億國民之愛國熱血莫不沸騰，期待澈底擊滅英美，</p>
<h3>日翼替會事務總長　由小氏繼任</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大政　　會以該會丸山事務總長已就任官城縣知事，現擬推薦後　副總裁暫代事務總長，嗣依據政府之决戰非常時措置要綱，鑒於國民運動之展開益形緊要，業已設置國民總厥起運動，連絡本部積極開始運動，故急於决定後任事務總長人選，藉解决翼贊運動當前之職務，以期運動之綜合一體化起見，乃任命產業報國會理事長小烟忠　氏繼任該職。</p>
<h3>日飛機製造求技術改進</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日農商省工藝指導所。自去年十月受軍需省航空兵器　局之委託，製造木質之航空機件後，即動員全國有力木工業者從事按術之指　。此次為謀各飛機製作公司技術之向上及生產之增强，特由工藝指導所及航空工業會共同主辦木質機用品製作技術講習會，並定於二十日起至二十八日止之八日間，召集有力木工公司之主任按術者及各地之關係指導者約二百名，於該指導所內受訓聽講。</p>

<h3>渝美兩軍時起衝突</h3>
<p>廣州十九日中央社電　美國擬化中國為其殖民地化之野心，日見露骨，因此渝方對美之反感逐漸激昻，其中美駐渝軍與渝軍間之傾軋，益縐深刻，　起衝突，已成當前軍大問題，十六日大公報社論會就此問題痛駁美渝軍間之傾軋，略謂：原因在於美軍輕視中國人，美人如不改變此態度，則必引起兩國間之震大問題，其大意如次：美駐渝軍與渝軍之間常起衝突者，實不　　之寒心，吾人雖欲兩軍常保和睦關係，然兩國間竟發現最大隔膜，查其原因主在兩軍之待遇不同，因渝軍之待遇不能與美軍相匹。故嫉妬於此發生，凡事總難　滿推行，此外因言語不通及日常生活上之風俗不同等，亦為其失和原因，然據渝軍所云美人態度常行侮辱中國人，兩國關係之重要性，於茲勿庸　言，此非僅於軍隊，即中美兩　民之關係，亦必須愈益緊密化，際此時期兩國民間竟有不能諒解者，將恐發生意外事態云。</p>

<h3>閑話時局　　德富蘇峰</h3>
<p>從甲午中日戰爭至日俄戰爭的十年間，中國學生來日本留　者，實已　萬。在我國當局中和人民中，都有先知先覺者，　為東亞的興　，必須首先和中國握手，甲午役後，所謂不打不交，於是中日才能提携起來，用了好多工夫，終於像今天這樣，留日學生源源而來了。然而談到結果，雖然不能一概而綸，但我們的誠心好意，’幾乎完全成為泡影·關於現由，或者是因為中國人的忘恩負義，但我們日本人也必須反省，也是由於日本完全缺乏熱情至織所致。根據我們的經驗看來，無道理和無熱情的事情，給與了中國留學生很多的惡劣印象。偶爾受到我的熱情者，對於我終身都持有好感，不幸而否然者，對於我終身則不能滌去惡感。今日震慶抗日份子尚能殘存者，雖然不能完全歸咎於這一點，然而在本鄉和神田附近的公寓內受到的白眼和冷酷，　都不會否認也有冷酷係。</p>
<p>現在我們日本成為東亞共樂閟的中心點，東亞各國和各民族，全都愈益加多地來日就學了。假如乘此時機，發揮光大謠曲「鉢之木」中所表現的我們大和民族固有的熱情，則我敢斷言，無往而不利。</p>
<p>甲午中日戰爭的時候。川上將軍曾對我說　：</p>
<p>「我們日本人雖然不能作上帝所作的事情情，我相信，我們日本人一定都能作出來」。</p>
<p>我們日本，終於本着這種精神，取得甲午中日戰的偉大勝利。又於一九○五年日俄戰爭時，東鄕侮軍上將上奏明治天皇說：</p>
<p>「臣誓死殲滅敵艦，以釋君懷」。</p>
<p>這是如何具有魄力的决心呀！諸葛亮在前後出師表中。雖然有不少驚天地泣鬼神的字句，但「成敗利鈍，非臣所逆賭」的字句，固然是正直無欺的坦白話，然而也是過於氣　的話</p>
<p>因此，我們决不是說就可以輕敵的，就可以過低估計敵人的。審察敵情，詳知敵勢，此所謂知彼，這是兵家最不可忽略的一件事。然而同時，以氣吞山河，敵愾精神，壓倒敵人的氣魄，也是最要緊的。至於所謂熾烈的鬥志，雄赳赳旺盛的戰意，浩浩然偉大的氣魄，對於瞭解大東亞戰爭進步性的我們，是必須具有的</p>
<p>我們日本近代兵家中，大村益次郎就是最優秀的一個。他最長於數學，一切的事情，都可以用數學算出來。他在石州口追擊幕府的兵，聚而殲之，其所以克石州陷出雲者，誠然是由於他的數學戰略得其宜，然而更重要者，就展的餘地。幕府的爪牙所謂傳習慣隊，是最初經過西式訓練的正規兵，與各藩鳥台之衆的士兵，是央不可同日而語的。儘管幕府的兵將。都是能征慣戰的勇士、然而終於失敗的原因，就是他們最缺乏者是數愾心，他們還在作戰前，早已呈現出幾分氣餒神氣。正所謂勝兵先勝，然後破敵，敗兵先敗、然後為敵所破。東條　相所說的勝敗之間，僅一髮之隔，也就是這個道理。</p>
<p>英美並無什麼可靠的支柱，只是依賴於算　計算必。簡而言之，他們認為如有數量則可以取勝的·然而世界史上所記戰的大戰爭，並非是多數壓倒少數，而是少數制服多數。試觀近代的例證，奉天會戰時，　非少數日本軍包圍多數俄軍，與以重大打擊了麼？假如當時日本兵稍微佔多數的話，則俄軍恐怕　全軍覆沒，無一生還者。但俄軍漬不成軍，四　逃散，於是陸戰——與海戰上的日本海戰相同——實一段落。假如戰爭都像算盤所計算者得到結果，那未希臘大破波斯是什麼道理？信長在桶狹間戰死敵將今川義之，這是什麼道理？這就是證明，雖不能一概而論，但大多數應是如此的，正如甲午中日之戰，日俄之戰所證明。因此算盤計算，雖然是戰爭上的震要因素，然而並非絕對的因素，英上還有更加重要者·這並非是物，而是人。並非是人的數量，而是人的精神。孫子所以說「以正合，以奇勝一者，就是承認算盤計算也在其內　然而同時還承認有更形重要者·（未完）（　寫自二月九日每日新聞）</p>

        <h1>1944.03.20</h1>
<h3>After the Execution of Hou Hu</h3>
<p>This time, the government's execution by firing squad of Hou Yi, alias Hou Zhengxian, who was found guilty in the military grain fraud case, is indeed a major event that has inspired the people. In terms of the government's credibility, it is indeed a major event that establishes prestige. However, purifying governance and enforcing official discipline are comprehensive and ongoing tasks. If only a partial approach is taken to a certain case due to temporary circumstances, the purification of the entire officialdom cannot be thorough, and what is gained is only a temporary stimulus. Therefore, the execution of Hou Hu is the beginning of purifying governance and enforcing official discipline, and should be extended to the entire officialdom.</p>
<p>In the past, the government issued many laws and regulations for purifying governance. In particular, the "Provisional Regulations for Punishing Speculation and Hoarding of Essential Commodities" and the "Regulations for Punishing Civil Servants for Corrupt Practices," promulgated in May and October of last year, were more concrete. Although the former did not specifically target officials, the government's intention to prevent officials from engaging in commerce and merchants from becoming officials, and to prevent them from hoarding, did indicate a desire to purify governance. However, corruption among high- and mid-level officials remained unchanged. Why did these corrupt officials dare to defy the law and risk their lives? The reason is very simple: the government lacked the determination to enforce the law. It is rumored that in December of the year before last, Supervisory Yuan members Ma Mengzhuang, Lü Yifeng, Zhao Shiyu, and others jointly impeached the authorities of the Ministry of Food, presenting evidence. However, the result was not only that the impeached officials of the Ministry of Food were not punished, but the supervisory committee members who filed the impeachment were dismissed. As a result, the functions of the Supervisory Yuan disappeared, and those who were corrupt and had connections became even more rampant. It is only now that we realize the dedication and courage of these supervisory committee members. Another example is the large-scale speculation and hoarding case in Shanghai investigated by Chen Zhishuo and other senior officials appointed by the government in April of last year. The result was that neither the big fish nor the small fish were caught. Because there were relatives, classmates, or other close relationships of senior officials involved in the corruption, or the implications were too great, they perverted the law for personal reasons, and this path was blocked. As a result, laws remained laws, and corruption remained corruption. Therefore, if the government lacks determination, then regulations, talks, and exhortations are just impractical facades.</p>
<p>This time, the government has the determination in the Hou Hu case. However, the investigation by the Japanese military police of the Allied powers undoubtedly contributed to this determination. However, not to mention other major corruption cases, even in this case, Hou Hu is still a small fish. It is especially hoped that this time, they will not catch the small fish and let the big fish go. We pointed out the responsibility of the highest officials of the Ministry of Food in our editorial on the 14th. What should also be noted now is that Gu Zhenheng is the Minister of Food of the Central Government, and Hou Dachun is the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food Bureau. All the responsible officials in charge of the hierarchical relationship bear joint responsibility, and of course, there is a need for investigation. Those who are not involved are, of course, exempt, but what about those who are suspected?</p>
<p>Whether the government has the determination to improve politics depends on whether it has the overall determination to purify officialdom; whether the government has the overall determination to purify officialdom depends on whether it has the determination to thoroughly investigate this military grain fraud case. At the same time, for the overall determination to purify officialdom, first, the government itself should continue to expose corruption in the future. Secondly, strengthen the legal system and severely punish corruption in accordance with the law. Unless it is said that in the entire officialdom, there is only this military grain fraud case, it is also a way to prevent corruption. Third, the functions of supervision and justice should be given the freedom to develop independently and fulfill the mission of investigation and prosecution. Fourth, adjust the treatment of civil servants to prevent the causes of corruption.</p>
<h3>Japan's Concrete Measures for Decisive Battles Are Implemented Step by Step, Raising Fighting Spirit and Moving Towards Victory</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese government decided on the "Essential Measures for Extraordinary Times in Decisive Battles" in the cabinet meeting on the 25th of last month, the finalized concrete implementation plans have been largely formulated and are being implemented step by step. So far, twelve items, including the "Concrete Measures to Stop High-Priced Entertainment," have been announced and implemented, and they are moving toward the path of decisive victory. At the same time, in order to raise fighting spirit, increase production, ensure food supplies, and establish the ability to defend the homeland, a national awakening movement is being launched by integrating the government's Greater Political Association and political associations. The thirty-three members of the Central Liaison Headquarters have been decided, and after holding the first meeting on the 18th, they will continue to promote the movement vigorously. In order to cope with the war situation within a week, the domestic affairs are also lively. For example, the Japanese government decided on the "Restrictions on Passenger Transportation" on the 14th, and also decided on the "Outline of Measures to Strengthen the Women's Volunteer Corps System" and the "Outline of Measures to Promote Labor" in the cabinet meeting on the 18th. The purpose of the first restriction on passenger transportation is to quickly strengthen transportation capacity, which is mainly used for increasing pressure and air defense, so general travel, except for students going to school and staff going to work, will be thoroughly restricted. The purpose of the second measure to strengthen the women's volunteer corps system is to strengthen women's participation in volunteering and make them work in the area of increasing production. Therefore, all single women aged 12 to 40, or single women depending on their profession or location, should, at the request of the times, cooperate in labor work based on patriotism, and its nature is different from general conscription. The third measure to promote labor is to transfer the military-style organization to the factory organization. The purpose is to clarify the attribution of responsibility and rapidly increase the efficiency of industrial plants. Therefore, the spiritual uplift of labor will be actively sought in the future, and the entire labor system will be thoroughly implemented through education, training, and renewal of labor management. It is reported that the implementation of the military-style command method in factories has already begun in some factories, and the results are quite good. Therefore, the Japanese government has adopted this method this time and wants to expand its implementation. Regarding the above-mentioned extraordinary measures, the people are all cooperating, and it is not difficult to expect complete results. Therefore, the Trade Association, the Political Association, and the government are actively planning to launch a national uprising movement, which can be said to be an appropriate measure. Among the essential measures for decisive battles, those that have not been concretized include "expanding the prohibition of manufacturing items and unifying specifications," "suspending peacetime projects and businesses," and "transferring central supervision affairs to local areas." In this essential outline of extraordinary measures for decisive battles, all will be put into practice. As mentioned above, Japan is currently making every effort to turn everything into war power, preparing for a general counter-offensive in the near future, and preparing for a decisive battle for a year. The patriotic enthusiasm of 100 million people is boiling, hoping to thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Mr. Koyanagi Appointed as Secretary-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Rule Assistance Association has appointed Maruyama, the secretary-general of the association, as the governor of Guan County. It is now planning to recommend Deputy President Hou as acting secretary-general. Later, in accordance with the essential measures of the government's decisive battle, it is deemed that the development of the national movement is increasingly important. A national uprising movement liaison headquarters has been established to actively start the movement. Therefore, it is urgent to decide on a successor for the secretary-general to solve the current duties of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and to achieve the comprehensive integration of the movement. Therefore, Koyanagi Tadashi, the chairman of the Industrial Patriotic Association, was appointed as the successor.</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks Technological Improvement in Aircraft Manufacturing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Arts and Crafts Guidance Center of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. Since being entrusted by the Aviation Weapon Bureau of the Ministry of Military Affairs last October to manufacture wooden aircraft parts, it has mobilized powerful woodworking companies across the country to provide technical guidance. This time, in order to improve the technology and increase the production of various aircraft manufacturing companies, the Arts and Crafts Guidance Center and the Aviation Industry Association jointly organized a wooden aircraft parts manufacturing technology training class, which is scheduled to be held for eight days from the 20th to the 28th. About 200 chief technicians from powerful woodworking companies and related instructors from various places will be gathered for training and lectures at the Guidance Center.</p>
<h3>Various Circles in Beiping Celebrate the Return of the Capital</h3>
<p>Beiping, 19th (Central News Agency) - All agencies in Beiping decided to hold a grand celebration from the 27th of this month to April 2nd to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital on the 30th of this month, and also to commemorate the anniversary of the return of the concessions by the Allied powers of Japan. Various agencies have separately drafted plans to hold a mass celebration rally, a mass entertainment rally, lectures, symposiums, public screenings, commemorative postmarks added to the post office, a youth speech contest, and a mass game rally. The enthusiastic situation at that time can be foreseen.</p>
<h3>Conflicts Occur Between Chongqing and U.S. Troops</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - The United States' ambition to transform China into its colony is becoming more and more blatant. Therefore, the anti-American sentiment in Chongqing is gradually intensifying. The friction between the U.S. troops stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing troops is becoming more and more serious, and the occurrence of conflicts has become a major military problem. The Ta Kung Pao editorial on the 16th severely criticized the friction between the U.S. and Chongqing troops on this issue, stating that the reason is that the U.S. military despises the Chinese people. If the Americans do not change this attitude, it will inevitably cause a major problem between the two countries. The general idea is as follows: The frequent conflicts between the U.S. troops stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing troops are truly chilling. Although we want the two armies to maintain a harmonious relationship, the greatest estrangement has been found between the two countries. The main reason is that the treatment of the two armies is different, because the treatment of the Chongqing troops cannot match that of the U.S. troops. Therefore, jealousy arises, and it is always difficult to promote satisfaction. In addition, differences in language and customs in daily life are also the reasons for their discord. However, according to the Chongqing troops, the Americans often insult the Chinese people. The importance of the relationship between the two countries is self-evident. This is not only in the military, but also the relationship between the Chinese and American people must be increasingly strengthened. At this time, if there are misunderstandings between the two peoples, unexpected events may occur.</p>
<h3>The Allied Powers Have Handed Over the Property of the Chongqing Faction in Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Yangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military authorities have been preparing to return the property of the Chongqing faction in the Jiangbei area, centered on Yangzhou, which they have managed since the Incident, to the National Government. It is now learned that the handover ceremony was formally held in Yangzhou on the 16th by representatives of both China and Japan. It is reported that more than 30 pieces of land, buildings, and other items were handed over this time. It is expected that the development of local economy and culture can be expected in the future.</p>
<h3>The Haizhou Officials and People Establish the Supporting Military Committee</h3>
<p>Xuzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haizhou, in order to cooperate in completing the war, the officials and people of Haizhou held a meeting of leaders from all walks of life at the beginning of the month, and decided on the candidates for chairman, vice-chairman, secretary-general, secretary, and committee members, and announced the official establishment.</p>
<h3>North China Promotes Increased Timber Production</h3>
<p>Beiping, 19th (Central News Agency) - In order to increase timber production in North China, the North China Afforestation Association has decided to plant 1.2 million trees on 400 hectares of forest land in Dakou, Shandong Province, and Zihe, Guan, Ning, and other places in Hebei Province, and to replant 623 hectares of forest land. The association has sent technicians to various places to start construction within a few days.</p>

<h3>Germany Actively Strengthens the Atlantic Fortress</h3>
<p>Starts Construction of Four Defense Lines</p>
<p>Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Berlin: It is reported that while the German military authorities are actively expanding and strengthening the Atlantic Fortress, they are also starting to construct a second fortress in the Atlantic. The original Atlantic Fortress was constructed based on the experiences of the Maginot Line and the Battle of Sevastopol. It is expected that the second fortress line that the German army is starting to construct this time is aimed at countering the landing tactics previously adopted by the anti-Axis forces. The completion of the third and fourth defense lines by the anti-Axis forces has made it impossible for the anti-Axis forces to ignore it.</p>
<h3>The Battle for Cassino Is Fierce</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - After the anti-Axis forces concentrated their bombing in southern Italy on the 15th, they launched their second offensive in Cassino.

However, they were repelled by a fierce counterattack by the German army, and the top of the mountain is still under German control. In addition, New Zealand and Indian soldiers who broke in from the east and north of the city launched a fierce attack under the cover of mortars and tanks. The German army gathered in the southwest of the city to launch a fierce counterattack and at the same time counterattacked the hills on the outskirts of the city, regaining part of them. According to German sources, the German army has repeatedly dropped paratroopers, so the defensive posture of Cassino is very tight.</p>
<h3>German Air Force Uses New Type of Bomb</h3>

<h3>Rumors of Another Meeting Between Roosevelt and Churchill</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to well-informed sources in Washington, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill will meet again, and the time will probably be after U.S. Undersecretary of State Stettinius visits England. The main focus of this meeting will likely be on political issues, but military attack plans will also be discussed. Washington believes that because the British and American people have recently criticized the Atlantic Charter, Roosevelt and Churchill may discuss re-emphasizing the post-war goals of the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Chinese and English News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from Washington: Well-informed sources in political circles here believe that Roosevelt and Churchill will hold another meeting soon to discuss the new situation caused by the Soviet Union's recognition of the Ba regime.

The attitude of the British and American governments towards the Soviet Union's recognition of the Ba regime; 2. The attitude of the British and American governments towards the Yugoslav government in exile; 3. The Soviet Union's request to determine borders and revise the Atlantic Charter.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk on the Current Situation by Tokutomi Soho</h3>
<p>From the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 to the Russo-Japanese War, the number of Chinese students coming to Japan to study was actually tens of thousands. Among our country's authorities and people, there were foresighted people who believed that for the rise of East Asia, we must first shake hands with China. After the Sino-Japanese War, the so-called "no fight, no friendship," so China and Japan were able to cooperate. After a lot of effort, it finally became like today, with a steady stream of students coming to Japan. However, when it comes to the results, although it cannot be generalized, our sincerity and goodwill have almost completely become a bubble. As for the reasons, perhaps because of the ingratitude of the Chinese, but we Japanese must also reflect. It is also due to the complete lack of enthusiasm on the part of Japan. Based on our experience, unreasonable and unenthusiastic things have given Chinese students a lot of bad impressions. Those who occasionally receive my enthusiasm have goodwill towards me for life. Unfortunately, those who do not cannot dispel their bad feelings towards me for life. The fact that anti-Japanese elements can still survive today, although it cannot be entirely attributed to this point, the coldness and indifference they received in apartments near Hongo and Kanda cannot deny that there was also coldness.</p>
<p>Now that Japan has become the center of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, countries and ethnic groups in East Asia are increasingly coming to Japan to study. If we take this opportunity to promote and develop the inherent enthusiasm of our Yamato people, as expressed in the folk song "Hachi no Ki," then I dare say that we will be invincible.</p>
<p>During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, General Kawakami once said to me:</p>
<p>"Although we Japanese cannot do what God does, I believe we Japanese can definitely do it."</p>
<p>Our Japan finally achieved a great victory in the Sino-Japanese War with this spirit. Also, during the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Admiral Togo Heihachiro memorialized Emperor Meiji, saying:</p>
<p>"Your subject vows to annihilate the enemy fleet to relieve Your Majesty's worries."</p>
<p>What a resolute determination! Although Zhuge Liang's "Memorial on Dispatching the Army" contains many earth-shattering words, the words "Success or failure, profit or loss, are not what your subject can predict" are, of course, honest and truthful words, but they are also overly modest words.</p>
<p>Therefore, we are by no means saying that we can underestimate the enemy or underestimate the enemy. Examining the enemy's situation and knowing the enemy's strength, this is what is called "knowing the enemy," which is the most indispensable thing for a military strategist. However, at the same time, the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers and overwhelming the enemy with indignant spirit is also the most important. As for the so-called fierce fighting spirit, vigorous and exuberant fighting spirit, and great and majestic spirit, it is necessary for us to understand the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Among our modern Japanese strategists, Omura Masujiro is the most outstanding. He is best at mathematics, and everything can be calculated with mathematics. When he pursued and annihilated the troops of the shogunate in Ishiguchi, his success in capturing Ishiguchi and conquering Izumo was indeed due to his mathematical strategy being appropriate, but more importantly, it was because he allowed the shogunate's troops no room to retreat. The shogunate's pawns, the so-called "traditional troops," were the first regular troops trained in the Western style, and they were not comparable to the soldiers of the various domains. Despite the fact that the shogunate's generals were brave warriors who were good at fighting, the reason for their ultimate failure was that they lacked the most important thing: indignant spirit. Before they even fought, they had already shown some discouragement. As the saying goes, "A victorious army wins first, then defeats the enemy; a defeated army loses first, then is defeated by the enemy." As Prime Minister Tojo said, "The difference between victory and defeat is only a hair's breadth," which is the same reason.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States do not have any reliable pillars, but only rely on calculations. In short, they believe that if they have quantity, they can win. However, the great wars recorded in world history are not cases of the majority overwhelming the minority, but of the minority subduing the majority. Looking at modern examples, during the Battle of Mukden, didn't the minority Japanese army surround the majority of the Russian army and inflict a major blow on them? If the Japanese army had slightly outnumbered the Russian army at that time, the Russian army would probably have been completely annihilated, with no survivors. But the Russian army collapsed and scattered in all directions, so the land battle—just like the Battle of the Sea of Japan at sea—came to an end. If wars were all like the results calculated by the abacus, then what is the reason for Greece defeating Persia? What is the reason for Nobunaga killing the enemy general Imagawa Yoshimoto in the Battle of Okehazama? This proves that although it cannot be generalized, most should be the case, as proved by the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. Therefore, abacus calculation, although an important factor in war, is not an absolute factor. There is something more important than calculation. This is not a thing, but a person. It is not the quantity of people, but the spirit of people. The reason why Sun Tzu said, "Join with righteousness, win with surprise," is that he admitted that abacus calculation is also within it. However, at the same time, he also admitted that there is something even more important. (To be continued) (Written from the Mainichi Shimbun on February 9)</p>
<h3>Rice Control Committee Convenes Meeting of Responsible Persons</h3>

<h3>Driver's Licenses to be Re-Issued</h3>
<p>Apply to the Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Works Bureau, in order to adjust the registration and issuance of licenses for drivers of automobiles and three-wheeled vehicles in District 1, and to centralize the handling at the Bureau's Motor Vehicle Inspection Office (inside the Bureau on Bailinan Road), has specially stipulated that all drivers who previously obtained automobile or three-wheeled vehicle driver's licenses from District 1 to District 8 must apply to the Bureau for a re-issuance of licenses.

<h3>Coal Briquette Retail Stores to be Re-Adjusted</h3>
<p>Citizens to Purchase Nearby</p>
<p>The third phase of household coal briquettes is scheduled to be the last day of sale today. It is understood that the fourth phase will begin distribution within a few days to meet the needs of citizens. Due to the urgent time of this implementation of quota allocation, the designated retail stores are far from the residences of citizens who have obtained purchase certificates, making it very inconvenient to purchase. Therefore, the Economic Affairs Department is re-adjusting and increasing the number of retail stores, which is expected to be implemented around May. It is also learned that retail stores selling household coal briquettes often have shortages in weight and poor quality, which have been reported by many citizens.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastically Donate to Complete Aircraft Donation</h3>
<p>Mayor Chen Issues Statement</p>
<p>Mayor Chen issued a statement to the citizens regarding the aircraft donation campaign, stating: "People from all walks of life in this city have organized a people's aircraft donation campaign committee to collect donations for aircraft, with the aim of further fulfilling the national duty to strengthen national defense. This move is truly commendable. In modern warfare, due to the development of the air force, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. Strengthening the air force will change the defensive air defense to offensive air defense, and the consolidation of rear security will benefit greatly. I believe that the citizens of Shanghai have been working tirelessly in their respective positions. I hope that they will continue to adhere to this original intention, economize their income, and do their best to donate to complete the aircraft donation campaign."</p>

<h3>Glutinous Rice for Wine Brewing - Allocation Method Formulated - Limited to 100,000 Picul for Three Provinces and Two Cities</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Control Committee has formulated the allocation method for glutinous rice for wine brewing, which has been approved and implemented.

The recipients of the allocation are members of the wine brewing industry guilds in three provinces and two special municipalities, and delivery will be made at designated locations by the Rice and Grain Control Committee in cash. The Rice and Grain Control Committee determines the allocation quantity for each county and two special municipalities, in principle, according to the previous year's wine brewing volume. The wine brewing tax amount collected by the Tax Bureau is the main reference material. The guilds should also determine the allocation amount for each of their members according to the method in Article 4. The allocation amounts determined by the Rice and Grain Control Committee and the guilds in accordance with Articles 4 and 5 should be notified to the Tax Bureau for record. When the method in Article 5 is implemented, it should be submitted to the competent provincial and municipal governments for record.

<h3>Increase in Capital of Banking and Money Industries - Deadline at the End of this Month - No Further Extension Will Be Granted After the Deadline</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen and improve the organizational structure of financial institutions and safeguard the assets of the people, the Ministry of Finance stipulated on June 1st of last year that the total capital of financial institutions that do not concurrently engage in savings and trust business must be increased to 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan actually paid up.

Otherwise, if the capital is not increased to the required amount after the deadline, the authorities will take measures such as banning, merging, or advising them to close down according to law. Later, the Banking and Money Industries Guilds presented a request for an extension until the end of March of this year, which was approved.

It is heard that the Ministry of Finance will not grant any further extension to the capital increase deadline for banks and money shops.</p>
<h3>Commodity Prices Continued to Fall Last Week</h3>
<p>The financial and industrial and commercial conditions in Shanghai last week became increasingly stable. The stock market and interbank lending rates did not fluctuate significantly, and the market remained relatively steady. After the Central Reserve Bank tightened lending, banks and money shops had ample access to legitimate funds, and people's minds were not as volatile as in the past. The selling prices of daily necessities in various industries have stabilized and stopped rising, and the wholesale prices of rice, oil, sugar, miscellaneous grains, matches, soap, candles, etc. on the black market have fallen. However, retail prices have not been able to follow suit. The authorities are paying attention to this and plan to take strict measures to rectify the situation. It is expected that commodity prices will continue to fall.</p>

<p>1.  Has ten or more regular workers.</p>
<p>2.  Uses any engine with a horsepower of half a horsepower or more.</p>
<p>3.  Is equipped with a boiler or other pressure vessel.</p>
<p>4.  The work is dangerous or detrimental to health.</p>
<p>If the business operation belongs to a special nature and requires the application for a special license from this office, in addition to the factory license, a special license must be obtained before work can begin. The factory license fee is 30 yuan in national currency per month, payable in advance every six months. The above application procedures must be completed before March 31st at the Third Section, Office No. 379, Industrial Investigation Department, No. 180 Fuzhou Road. After the deadline, it will be considered as operating a factory without a license, and will be dealt with in accordance with the regulations. This notice is hereby issued for public knowledge.</p>
