<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>必勝政治</h3>
<p>— 德富蘇峰</p>
<p>國民所最希望者，是安心。安心就是信任當局的意思。正如孔子所說的意思，解決食糧問題與軍事問題以取信於民，在任何嚴重情形下保持安寗秩序，安心服務，此三者如不備則不能存在，這就是今日最適當的座右銘。</p>
<p>武田信玄公是從人民得到安心的偉大政治家，這是因為一般人想信：「在信玄公屬下做事，是絕對安心的。沒有盜刧和敵兵的担心，可能生活過得很好，且很安全」。信玄公之所以為偉大政治家就在這一點，決不是由於他實行减租免稅政策。他的口號，即人是城，人是墻。別的武將建築城，而他製造船，並沒有建築城。但這並不是一件容易事。房捐，人夫徵發，年貢等，固然相當酷苛，但人民並未以為苦。大家都以他為公司的總經理或常董，而非常安心。達到如此地步，政治家就可以畢業。今日的政治家，我希望能體騐一點他的政治心理學。</p>
<p>今日的政治家，如不考察人民的要求如何，這是一件大錯而特錯的事。政治家如把握到花木的要求，應澆水的時候澆水，應上肥料的時候上肥料，應剪枝的時候剪枝，應除草的時候除草；又如醫生認識到病人的要求，這樣才能體味到政治的眞諦。政治方面有一種確定的規則，必須詳細探究人民的心理，必須安規則事，而如不知花木的心理，雨天仍澆以水，則花木就有水浸之虞。（但在雨天並不是沒有對花木澆水的情形。）這是　於未想到政治的關係。大則爲國，小則爲城鄕，全都是必需的。</p>
<p>信玄公是非常富於研究心的人，每作一次戰爭後，則一定集合家人作一番自我檢討，正如演習後的此評一樣，這就是他過人之處。東鄉元帥也是這樣人。日木每戰之所以致勝，是研究前此黃海作戰的收獲。最初想用並行戰法，但完全改變，而施行丁字型戰法了。一般人會傳說，這或許是採取的幕僚意見，但東鄕曾對我說，「是我自己想出來的」。</p>
<p>雖然說把握人心很重要，但在物質萬能的塲合下，有時是不可能的，工作停頓則用黃金萬能主義方法與以金錢，收攬人心，這不是沒有限度的。現在舉一例來看，在菲爾德爾費工塲因工資問題而罷工，竟出動大批軍隊來干涉。在路易喬治著的「世界大戰的回顧」一書中，描寫着他們的弱點。眞正使人行動者，並非金錢。信玄公的家人山形三朗兵衛，為人非常忠實，但毫不希望榮華富貴，當聽到隣國同樣階級的家人竟有三四倍多的傣祿，然而絲毫不為所動。「三郎日記」中也曾寫着，大久保彥左衛門的俸祿，不過三千石。與此相差　殊者，橘飛　守，於關個原役時會背叛其主人，後因重新歸來，而領十萬石傣祿。大久保彥左衛門對於主人固然說了不少不滿的話語，但共沒有背叛主人者，就是主人家康曾不斷稱讚他「勞苦功高一，在精神上得到滿足所致。</p>
<p>近年常講吃飽主義。本來人餓着肚皮是不能辦事的，如肚餓而不感覺其餓，這是暫時性的，一次兩次固無問題，但如常此以往，就不能戰爭下去。但吃飽也有兩種，一是肚皮的吃飽，二是精神的吃飽。明智光秀投到信長那邊去，只是大吃大嚼，不達發脹不止，在坂本等處領有城池，領有采邑，而一般人都以爲他會一心保持忠節，甚至信長也認爲他縱挨打受罵也不會叛變地那樣成了暴發戶了。然而由於精神上的不飽，終於造成反咬主人一口的結果。信玄公很淸楚地知道這一點，所以在肚皮方面也讓吃飽，在精神方面也讓吃飽，而達到上下一心，即所謂「人是城，人是檣」的地步。</p>
<p>政府固然常說使人民吃飽就可以了，然而如果這話是對的，那末富紳之類的子女都該成爲出人頭地的聖人。回看事實，窮人予弟中何嘗沒出過許多偉人呢？這一事實，對於只要吃飽，則萬事亨通這一槪念，打得體無完膚，是由於精神努力的結果，而偉大起來的。正如中國人中有一句「飢腹產寄策」的話，如飢餓過去後，則奇策不一定就變爲惡策，所以還是吃得適當飽的好。</p>
<p>敵人以大量的物資來對付我們，而我們也用大量的物資來對付他們，這種思想是一件大錯而特錯的事。日本爲什麼在開戰時取得了那樣偉大的勝利呢？那是因爲他們老早就武斷地承認有豐富的物量，而日本的物量並不大，如英美共同作一恫嚇姿態，則日本定會俯首貼耳，就是說，他們過於相信物量，而輕視精神。然而日本却忽視物資，憤慨而起，取得眞珠灣及馬來海面的偉大戰果。固然不能說不要物資，但所恃者是乘敵人的錯誤策略，他們認為日本縱戰百年也不能取勝。正如一般人所說，特質精神一體，肚皮和精神的吃飽，在任何情形下都是必要的，物資當然也必須充實，如物資一有缺少，則用精神來補充是絕對要的。</p>
<p>意志旣決，不論在門外打也好，也不論在門口打也好，甚至在屋內打也好，但打，都是一樣的。總之，只要把他們打得落花流水，就可以，日本不特別爬山涉水，只要以逸待勞，這是如何感謝上蒼的事，所以目前我們日本人的任務，就是要堅持必勝信念，与以打擊的。我們愈是持久戰，則愈發揮强力，他們是一個紙老虎，一下雨就完了。因此，他們乘未下雨的期間，傾全力來犯，就是這個意思。他們並不是人類，而是動物。他們認爲如不快一點打，則內心在戰戰兢兢的恐懼。勝敗究竟決定於長期戰，抑決定於短期戰，這完全要看日本人的堅忍的程度。</p>
<p>主要的就是物質和精神打成一片，要考慮到精神和物資的吃飽，而向前邁進。精神枯竭時，則加以充實。充實到不爲敵人所乘就够了。日本第一的武器，並不是飛機和坦克，而是忍耐，是精神的充實，如能忍耐，敵人縱能逼向前來，則敵人愈近一寸，而我們日本的勝利愈近一寸。所以用不着驚恐，而要鎭靜，只有打擊敵人。我希望大家都要抱定這種精神。</p>

<h3>靑年生活營　昨舉行結業式　陳代主席親臨主持</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　新國民運動靑年暑期勞動生活營第二期，以各項訓練業經完了，昨（二十六）日為最後一日，上午七時三十分起，由日本總司令部　　參謀作特別演講，就大東亞戰爭與歐洲戰局，詳加分析。繼於九時三十分起，舉行全體座談會，出席全體長官及學員，由林營長親自主持，開會後，首由北平·天津·徐州。靑島。保定·通縣·蚌埠·蕪湖·揚州·南京·及河北省·河南省·山西省·山東省·江西省等單位學員代表，報吿各該地靑運槪况。繼由各學員提出問題，分由各長官詳細解答。最後，由林營長綜合各學員問題，剴切訓示，直至十二時餘，始告完畢。下午三時，舉行結業式，及中國靑年模範團團員入團宣誓式，國府陳代主席親臨主持，陳代主席於軍樂悠揚聲中，由全體官長學員肅迎，蒞臨生活營，稍事休息，典禮即吿開始。行禮如儀後，首由林營長報吿第二期生活營辦理經過，然後頒發畢業證書，幷舉行模範團員入團宣誓，由林營長以書記長資格監誓。繼由陳代主席宣讀領袖訓詞，各學員恭聽之下，無不感奮異常。旋由學員代表恭讀上領袖致敬電文，遂於熟烈之國民呼，及雄壯之中國靑少年團歌聲中結束此隆重議式。</p>
<h3>德軍集團國境　準備大決戰　反軸心加强外交包圍陣</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　英美蘇三國與羅馬尼亞締結之休戰絛約業已簽字。二十三日以來，雅賽正面之羅馬尼亞軍不再抵抗，蘇軍在二十三日之一日中，一舉向東南進至百五十公里，其機械化部隊已突入烏恩協定時所劃定之外錫爾伐尼亞新國境之一角，其勢似在遮斷雅賽東方之德軍退路，因此該方面之德軍現已陷入包圍之危境，然此部隊戰力頗強，一旦獲得共牙利方面之德軍協力，不難衝破蘇軍包圍。羅馬尼亞之倒戈政權，傳稱已承認烏恩協定之國境綫，羅軍或將進佔烏恩協定中之洪牙利領土外錫爾伐尼亞，亦未可知。洪牙利政府亦有此種預測，而將主力軍集於兵力而增强外交包圍陳，以期於短期中結束歐戰之傾向，漸次　著，故外交情形極度緊迫。羅馬尼亞倒戈後，轟炸德國之基地較義法更近，此事對於德國實爲不利，然德軍最高統帥部早將反軸心軍之此種企圖編入案中，而將大兵力調入德國境內，決意繼續抵抗。故前述之各種情勢，對於德軍作戰之根本方針，並無何等重大之打擊。</p>
<h3>渝方力圖　掩飾敗續</h3>
<p>中央滬訊　衡陽之陷落，實予重慶以痛烈打擊，重慶當局猶掩飾軍長等之投降事實，此由各地舉行之衡陽陣亡將士追悼會等觀之，常可明瞭。最近爲期挽回民氣頹廢之抗戰心理，大事宣傳收復衡陽作戰，及湖北反攻作戰等。又謂日軍撤退密芝那後，渝軍不久將行進攻　緬戰綫。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局二十五日發表，渝軍之一部，頃對宜昌方面，試行反攻，其目的在緩和湖南日軍之壓迫云。</p>
<h3>巴爾幹　各國動態　土耳其</h3>
<p>保京二十六日中央社電，海通社訓，土京消息：土內閣昨午前開會，內閣總理　拉卓格魯焉央社電　據安加拉電：土耳其政府已決定召還駐維希政府大使耶爾延氏。</p>
<h3>保加利亞</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　據索菲亞電：保加利亞總理巴格亞諾夫將軍·外長特拉加諾夫·陸長路易耶夫中將等，於日曾舉行重要會議。</p>
<p>索非亞二十六日中央社電　德土絕交後，蘇軍即進攻羅馬尼亞，同時保加利亞首相亦發表東要聲明，巴爾幹軍事於政治之情勢，似將發生莫大之激動。總之，保加利亞一方與德國維持同盟關係，一方對英美宣戰，此外更以斯拉夫之血統而與蘇聯與矛盾日益加重。其所以演變之直接原因，實由於軸心對反軸心戰况之變化，保國之現勢宛如風前殘燭，其有所望者乃德軍能挽回戰局也。</p>
<h3>搶救垂危的國家　應從事勞動服務　領袖對生活營結業訓詞</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　新國民運動靑年暑期勞動生活營，於二十六日下午舉行結業式，陳代主席躬臨主持，茲錄領袖訓詞原文如后：</p>
<h3>勞心勞力並無二致</h3>
<p>「新國民運動靑年暑期勞動生活營第二期，舉行結業典禮，各學員不辭溽暑，願從各地前來生活營受嚴格訓練，並且每天　要到農塲去做勞動服務，道種精神，實堪嘉尙</p>
<p>從前有一句話，說是「勞心者治人，勞力者治於人」，把勞心勞力兩者分做兩個階層，「個在上，一個在下，這實在是封建時代的觀念。這種觀念我們國家衰弱之原因，固然很多，而這點不能不說是原因之一。須知智力與體力的部門，雖有不同，但是勞力的收獲與心的收穫，對於國家民族的貢獻，並無二致。而且沒有勞力意識的人，任何怎樣勞心，要想生存於今日的世界，是不可能的。何况我國自戰亂以來，生產凋敝，全國上下如不振作精神，急起直追，則國家民族前途，更將不堪設想。</p>
<h3>團結邁進解放東亞</h3>
<p>新國民運動靑年暑期勞動生活營之舉辦，就是針對上述現象，以勞動服務爲訓練中心，期於養成學員勞動服務生活習慣，負起增加生產的重大使命，所以除了思想訓練，軍事訓練之外，同時更應着重技能訓練。關於這點，我已於上期結業典禮中說過了，不過諸位學員應該時時念及我們現在所行的勞動服務，其主要的目的，是爲了搶救我們這個垂危的國家，所以我們從事勞動服務，不是爲個人打算，而是爲國家民族謀福利，爲東亞謀解放，也不是一個個人零零碎碎的去做所能爲力，必須上下一心，團結邁進，才能於非常危難局面，把國家搶救回來，使東亞求得解放。此次勞動生活營，從各地選拔優秀靑年，同在一起，過一樣的生活，做一樣的勞動，守一樣的紀律，並且樹立一樣的中心思想，也正是要集中意志，充實力量，合全體的知力，謀全體的生存。</p>
<h3>增加生產勞動保國</h3>
<p>我國本來是以農立國的國家，在事變以前，我國的食糧就感不足，每年海關入口的米麥，佔着很大的數目。事變以後，田園荒廢，遊匪橫行，生產更見减少，所以民生困苦，未能解際。目前我們對於增加生產的工作，已刻容不緩，而且現代的戰爭，是總力戰，爲了協力大東亞戰爭，更有增加生產的必要，實行勞動報國，不是一個空洞的口號，我們於勞動服務時，必須認定增加生產，充實民力，發達國力，是主要的目標。只有充實民力，發達國力，才能完成興復中華的使命，才能分擔保衛東亞的責任。</p>
<p>目前迫切需要的訓練，是今年新國民運動工作的一個重點。暑假期間，中央及各地都有同樣的組設，自然是非常必要的，中央方面因交通及設備種種關係，一二兩期的學員，合計只有二百餘人，全國靑年希望接受這種訓練而無機會到中央受訓的，還有很多。我們希望以諸位同志爲起點，離營以後，由諸位同志將這神傳播到各地，蔚爲風氣，使全國靑年，全國國民，皆能認眞勞動服務，負起充實民力，發達國力的工作。我想果能這標，中國一定能復興，東亞一定能解放的，諸位同志受訓三星期，時間雖短，但是責任却異常重大，結業之日，即工作開始之時，惟望勇猛精建，刻苦耐勞，與全國青年團結一致，爲復興中華，保衛東亞，擔負起時代的使命」。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點</p>
<h3>防衛空襲須知</h3>
<p>警報下之準備</p>
<p>有人於警戒警報發出時間，認為從事於警戒警報之工作即可，而於此際不存空襲言報即將繼續發出之念，即一旦空襲警報發出時，始更從事空襲之措置，必需要相當時間，故當警戒醫報發出時，認爲距空襲警報發出時，尙需相當時間者，實屬極錯誤之觀念，應予糾正。又須注意，有時警戒警報及空襲警報發出後，突然遭遇空襲者，又瞬時發出空襲警報時，有時可立刻成空襲警報態勢，及空襲態勢者，故亦應事先妥為準備。</p>
<p>實施燈火管制</p>
<p>燈火管制，此後仍須積極實施，縱有些微燈光漏洩，即可爲敵機之嚮導，故應妥加遮蔽，自已檢點家屬外，同時隣保間相互分擔責任，檢看有無光綫外漏，期避免引起意外之不幸，蓋因不注意而洩漏極微之燈火，不僅自蒙損害，如敵投下燒夷彈時，必將引起火災，而獲得判斷之材料，故燈火管得應加以嚴厲注意，實施燈火管制之綱要。當警戒警報發出時間，尙可餘剩一部殘置燈，但空襲警報時，即應立刻滅燈，但殘置燈減燈時，應由隣保之負責者，警防團員，保甲團員等負責者擔任之。當然於空襲警報時，如能完全將燈火隱蔽，雖不滅燈亦可，但此應澈底嚴密施行始可。假如雖已完全隱蔽，然仍有光綫外漏時，此際應有淍密檢查燈火管制材料之必要，同時爲期萬全起見，除必要之燈外，其他全部滅燈。</p>
<p>待避所之完備</p>
<p>空襲之際，除直接中彈以外，炸彈落下，即近距十米左右，如能躲入壕中，即可避免受害，由此觀之，實有設置完全之待避所之必要，此以設於地下爲原則。一·設於屋外時，如在崩壞物有落下之處之處，例如在着前附近，而無掩蓋時，即生危險，如無辦法時，應以被　等掩蓋，如是遇磚瓦墜落時，當可避免若干損害。二·設於屋內時，必須築一出口，又事屬可能時，應於壕內設有房屋倒壞時可於下面突上而出之設備。三·造防空壕時，續充分注意，選定適當之塲所，萬不能在地下掘壕時，即地上亦可。但此際以在泥土或木框中填土者為掩蓋物，必要蓋者，因空襲時遇有地雷彈能捲起土砂極多，及防備高射砲彈之彈片有落下之　。掩蓋以二三寸之粗木材架於洞口之兩側各高出一尺左右，而置木板或泥土於其上面即可。躱入無掩蓋之待避所時，必須以被褥等蓋覆身上，造待避所時，盡可能以能避少數人者為限，期於直接蒙受炸彈時可使損害减至最小限度。又造待避壕之距離，以盡量遠隔爲宜，此壕不僅家人可避，即路人應宜使其躲避</p>
<p>防止謠言發生</p>
<p>當敵機空襲時，為防諜起見，必須特別注意下列各點一知半解不知真情，吐露不注意之言詞極為危險，應宜切戒。書信上如寫蒙受空襲時之損害狀况時，適足引起謠言之發生，故應充分注意，應信賴當局之發表，勿輕信無稽謠言，並努力消除謠言之發生。當茲空製已成事實之際，應脫離形式上的基礎的訓練，採受適應實戰之訓練，俾可一旦緊急時，施行最大效力（完）莫小覷團結合羣的意義</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息　小朋友同情小朋友　莫小覷團結合羣的意義</h3>
<p>人類同情心的發生，畢竟是最自然的本能的。我們從助學運動如火如荼的情况中，更加得到確切的證明。例子很多，不勝枚舉。昨天我們又接到潤華小學五年級全體小學生來信，發起節省糖果費一天，湊集一千兀捐充助學金。原兩說：「執事先生：我們都是潤華小學五年級的學生，今年書本上第一課就是「一個不識字的女孩」，讀後我們都深深感到不識字是很痛苦的。同時我們也覺得自已真幸福極了，在這暑期內我們還有補習的機會，這更使我們同情許多失學的好學生們。所以我們發起節省糖果費一天，大家聚攏來捐給貴報作助學金，雖然祇有小小的一千元，但是我們想，假使全上海的學校，每級有一千元捐作助學金，一定是一個不小的數目吧！先生們為古學生們服務，我們在這裹祝你們康健。潤華小學五年級全體學生同啓。」助金數目雖然不大，可是，小朋友們的同情心却很尊貴，况且，小朋友們能够共同發起節約助學，團結合羣的意義報尤屬難得。這種意義能够擴而大之，教育前途大有可觀，國家前途更可期待，莫小覷吧！</p>

<h3>鋼鐵般的防空工塲</h3>
<p>佔領塞班島的敵人，再圖侵入關島。養精蓄銳的一億國民，忍氣　緊，抑制着心頭上的熊熊怒火，而拚命生產復仇的兵器。但驕橫的敵人，企圖摧毀我們日本的「復仇刃」，而開始轟炸日本的工塲。我們日本雖說遭受空襲，但停止生產是絕對沒有的然而假如工塲防空設備不完全，則不能希望提高生產。……不久前警察廳曾向直轄各工塲頒佈「工塲防空能勢緊急整備强化耍綱」，當然不待政府督促，而整頓成爲縱空襲亦毫不足怕的銅鐵船的防空陣勢。「敵欃要來就來吧！」但生產決不因此而受阻。表示這樣堅强決心的三個工塲：日本光學某製作所，日立精機某工塲，中島飛機某工塲，現在暫時我們加以考察。下面就是學習防空工塲的生產防空辦法。</p>
<h3>日本光學製作所</h3>
<p>自從高聲呼出空襲必來的口號，業已很久了。這個日本光學某製作所，是首先完成的。至於這一個工塲的防空設備如此完備，則不能不說是五代製作所長的熱忱所致五代氏在工塲內到處走，他所認爲有防空設備必要者，即指令實行。防護班的誕生，也是大東亞戰爭開始後的事情。防護班按所長的意旨行事，現在業已收到良好的效果。</p>
<p>首先映人眼簾者，即是工塲各處都完全設備好遮光設施，在空襲下作工毫無障礙。現在是從橫面封閉的，但還要加以改造，是從上而下，實行完全　　。此外待避所是長五十公尺寬三公尺的地下室，可以容納二百五十人，還有能收容人人至十人的有蓋待避壕六十所，在各工作間裏建築着沙袋堆成的待避所。此外最後留於工作間而實行防火和滅火的作坊防薩班之屋內簡易待避壕，有二十處。其中該製作所所側重者，就是防彈設備，在工場的各作坊中，爲保護重要的機械和各種設備，而把土牆和水門打牆用木板和鐵板包裝起來，構成防彈設備。如有「有恃無恐」的防彈設備，才會感覺到眞正空襲下生產的安全性。此外防護團本部和對空監視所，是用厚的防彈牆很堅固地保護着。實行這種防空設施時，頗感不足的資材和勞力，是怎樣處理的？這一個最嚴重的問題，是任何工塲所必然遭受到的利用附近疏散的舊建築物器材。勞力則爲製作所內部的全部人員—尤其擔任事務的人員中，每日以三十人至四十人組成動勞奉公隊，拚命建造防彈牆及掘挖待避壕。</p>
<p>由於資材的設法，勞力的自給，工塲幹部的熟忱，此三者相互推動，而完成了兩個防空設施。道一個實例，就是設明防空設施不能完備，是無理由的。</p>
<h3>中島飛機某工塲</h3>
<p>中島飛　某工塲，安藤所長已下最後決心，斷然整頓防空設施。按工塲從業員所提供的勞力以及資材，無論如何都要整備這一設施。響應所長這樣熱忱的全部從業員，各自携帶鏟鍬，開始掘挖防空壕了，所長雖六十一歲的老者，但亦以身作則，拚命掘挖防空壕。另外婦女從業員，各自從家庭中帶布來，倐忽間縫成數條砂袋，然後取下食堂的天花板，走廊牆板，牀板等非必需之物，瞬息間立刻完成防彈設備工程開始是七月十三日，但由於日以　夜的勞動熱忱，而收容全體從業員的數百待避壕，防彈設施等，僅在兩日內完成，於是克服了資材及勞力的不足現象，而竟對於工塲防空設施大功吿成。</p>
<h3>日立精機某工塲</h3>
<p>日立精機某工塲，正式準備工塲防空，是一九四二年七月以來的事，當時從築城本部聘請專門家，完全服從其命令，指示和意圖，而從一九四三年二月至三月，利用手頭所有的資材，從事建設了防彈，救火，燈火管制，待避，防毒，遼望等設施，然而特長就是燈火管制。假如警戒警報一發，各工塲的鈴聲一齊發響，於是不到〇分鑛，這一周圍〇公里的龐大工塲，瞬息間完全在黑影中消逝。爲達到道種成果，該工塲聳立着數根據型房頂之垂直部份，即在天窗的玻璃部份上，約分三之二的外部　以黑色，內部則　以白色，某餘三分之一則掛一黑　，用恰好的一個大木框放在上面，平時和白天，則吊開，如警報一發出，則工塲的所有窗戶應聲一齊關閉。但這無數的窗戶。早已規定好誰負遮光　任，全在窗戶上掛着一個人名木頭牌子，寫着擔任黑幕及遮光工作。如稍加注意，則知用心的週到。</p>
<p>此外工塲內所有的電燈周圍都掛着一個二尺黑圓筒式之防空罩。過去三百支光的電燈泡，全部改爲一百支光的燈泡，這也十分够用。在出入口處，爲使其局部發光照明，所有都用一種金屬物遮住。（安譯自七月二十六日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>赤道風景　蘇門答臘的生活狀況</h3>
<p>— 矢野兼三</p>
<p>因（爲聽說到熟帶地方去，非好好保養身體不可，所以在動身前先向在那邊住過的人打聽，並讀了一些關鈴熱帶生活的書籍，據說在南方不可吃刺身（生魚片也），不可飲酒，不可喝冷水。總之，應該注意飲食。可是，後來這三條禁律我一項也未遵守。</p>
<p>巴東的刺身可口得很，我每晚用印度洋的鯛·鯧下酒。印度洋岸是暖流，是砂地，魚的生息甚繁，肉質也很鮮美，但麻六甲沿海因多泥地，魚味比較差一點兒。再加所產鰻魚鯰魚都生着鱗或其貌可畏，即使味美，看到它們那副「魚相」，連我這個最嗜刺身的人，也胃口全無了。到了蘇門答臘以後，印度洋岸方面，從實武牙到巴東一帶，所產的都是鮮肥的佳品，於是我放開肚皮，大吃特吃。</p>
<p>至於水，在巴東有很不錯的井，誰都是　嘟　嘟地喝的，似乎沒有人依照衛生方式將它煮沸氷凉之後再飲用的。</p>
<p>總而言之，南方的坐活堪埒王侯，食品是豐富的，可口的，祇怕你沒胃口。不過，有一點非常遺憾，就是沒有家，未免太寂寞無聊啦！固然，在晚上或暇時，不妨拿一本書來解解悶，可是這樣老不能克服寂寞之感。</p>
<p>健康秘訣</p>
<p>上面的三戒雖然完全打常也　注意健慶之道，藉此補救飲食方面的不注意。第一項就是每天早　騎一越馬。黎明時　着屬，迎着印度洋的晨風，在街路上徐行疾駛，眞是再寫意也沒有了。有時碰到當地的兒童，就帶着他們一同騎馬。因此，巴東的孩子們和我打得火熱，後來和他們的大人也熱識了。這次他們知道我要歸國，一個淸早就等在路上，將鮮花送給我，並且再三邀我去喝咖啡，這樣一連好幾日，眞使我又開心又覺得煩累。</p>
<p>當時，凡是好的健康方法我都幹。網球呀，游泳呀，沒有一樣不來。在官邸裏開了一個畏四十米廣二十米的池，將河水引進來，一星期必定去游兩次，結果，臉孔也晒得黑黑。</p>
<p>因此，在任二足年，不曾罹過一次瘧疾或什麼熱帶病，並且連好像是病的樣子也不曾有過一次。對於一切事物，都須積極，實服病魔，也要這樣。</p>
<p>不可做的是狂飲濫吃和熬夜—關於這一點，通宵達旦地打牌着棋尤其不可以。這點希望今後到南方去的人切記在心。</p>
<p>我在任地覺得非常感動的事情之一，便是招募義勇軍的情形。募集的那一天，在巴東政應前面的廣塲上，聚集了超過定額幾十倍的當地民衆，眞叫人又驚又喜。</p>
<p>特別是住在以中部蘇門答臘的巴東爲中心的梅南喀罷烏族，他們是印度尼西亞人中智能最發達的種族，對於從前荷蘭的高壓十分怨恨，極願和日本協力。這在戰事正劇的現在，物資旣少，因難亦多，但於這個時候協力作戰總是要緊的，這樣將來民族才有發展，所以非常熱心。例如在檢查體格時，因　力不佳而被剔除的人，總口口聲聲反問道：「長官不也戴着眼鏡嗎？」「日本將士中不是也有戴眼鏡的人嗎？」還有一個應募者因爲身材矮小而落選，因他不服氣地喊着說：「矮有什麼關係，我的力氣可大哪！」試騐官中間有一個是柔這初段的軍屬，聽他這麼說便站起來將他丟了一個觔斗，他爬起來以後雖然有些羞慚，但仍堅持着說：「我是村中的代表，不能這樣就回去，千萬給我一個證明書！」一定不肯空手歸家。就這幾點看，便可知道壯丁檢查塲中是如何充溢着他們的熱意。</p>
<p>學生敎書</p>
<p>日語的善及也足驚人。有趣的是：中學內年級越低日語也越好，特別是中一的學生，日語最佳。小學中也已敎授日語，自從日軍進駐以來，先生學生一同開始學習日語，結果有些先生反要學生做翻譯，這大槪因爲孩子比成人更能專心學習的緣故吧</p>
<p>自我就任蘇門答臘行政長官以來的兩年後，當地人士給我的醫信都夾着漢字，而且寫得很不錯。這眞使我感到意外。我大胆用馬來語和他應酬，不料他仍用日語應答。大官聽了，不禁大喜：「哈哈哈，好極啦！日語普及到這個樣子，眞呌人驚嘆。此外，像矢野長官這樣會講馬來語的人，還是第一次遇到。不過，長官的馬來語尙不及本地人的日語哩。哈哈。」（譯自七月廿三號朝日週刊）</p>
<h3>法國戰區形勢圖</h3>
<p>法國全境，現正發生激烈戰鬥。參加作戰之德軍及反軸心軍，約共二百萬之衆。北部方面，反軸心軍裝甲部隊與德軍激戰後，自西經凡爾賽及賽爾，自南經埃泰浦，巴黎公路，突入巴黎市區，發生猛烈巷戰。南部方面，土倫與馬賽兩港繼續激戰中，德軍牽制大批敵軍，漸向里昂方面實行解脫戰。比斯開灣敵軍登陸以來，德軍避離行動順利。</p>

<h3>重逢</h3>
<p>— 翼凡</p>
<p>在一條幽靜的馬路上·偶然遇見了別有年餘的同學〇君。</p>
<p>依然是那末沉鬱的面容，身體似乎更顯得瘦長些。他脅下挾着一疊簿子，我欣然而又略感悵失地知道他做了小學敎員。</p>
<p>在愁苦的生活中遇見了曾經一塊歡樂過的友人，大家將在默默中相遞一個凄凉的笑吧？然而當遇到了曾經相對嘆息過的友人呢？我沒有發生更深的悲哀，我只重新把我們底過去咀嚼了一番，過去的一切彷彿來得更甜蜜了。過去我們雖不是最投契的朋友，但還够得上知己，這友情是相當美好的。而今，經過畏時間的疏遠，我們又在流離苦難的窮途上難得相見了，雖不禁淚水在眼裏打轉，但心情却是愉快而溫暖的呵！</p>
<p>就在這黃昏籠罩的寂寞的道路上，我們並肩且走且談着暮色沉落在我們底四週。</p>
<p>他是　於沉默的，但這次他的話却很多。他底熱忱令我感激。</p>
<p>「孩子，可愛的孩子」；他興奮地說着，「他們是多麼的純潔天眞啊！和他們在一塊，我只爲自已感到慚愧，因爲我的心至少已不是潔白的了。我能從他們身上得到莫大的安慰，這安慰遠超過他們所給予我的辛勞。……我是無時不以眞心的和藹來愛他們的，所以他們也沒有一個不和我相親要好。尤其是當我生了一點病的時候，小朋友們三五成羣的來看我，有的說些有趣的安慰我的話，有的買點吃的東西來送我。啊，這看了眞使我有說不出的愉快。……嗨，眞有意思」「那末你對於現在的生活是很滿意的了？」我看着他底凝思的面孔問。</p>
<p>「是的，這裏是還算好的，因爲我們這學校裏方並無分校長敎員，完全是幾個志趣相同的朋友合辦的，所以校長剝削敎員的現象就沒有。不過，爲了收入的菲轉，我下學期不得不要棄敎從商了。呵，商界，你看這是多麼齷齪的地方？我怎末能登得下去？……都市，這罪惡的都市，唉，我是早就想離開牠了，但因爲不忍拋棄這一羣可愛的小朋友和這一個淸白的學校，所以才逗遛下來。可是，現在連留在這裏也不可能了！你想，我怎能不憂愁？」</p>
<p>「是的，你一直就憎恨這都市，所以你二年前回鄕了一次，但是你爲什麼又終於到上海來了呢？」我趁機不客氣然而熱心地駁覆他道一個田園理想家。</p>
<p>「唉，那也是沒有法子呀，因爲家庭裏是希望我在外「發展」的，他們說在鄉下沒有出息；而他們的所謂有出息，便是升官發財！唉，我眞不明白多數靑年的父母的思想都是道樣的頑固腐敗，這思想一天沒有肅淸，中國便一天不能得救！」他憤慨地說完，便再三搖頭欷　着。</p>
<p>我也同情地嘆息起來，但我不能茍同他底懷戀鄉村的意識。</p>
<p>「你說的是對的，但我們要爲社會貢獻一點力量，却並不一定限定在鄕下在都市裏，都市和鄉下同樣有社會性的　結在，同樣需要我們去改革。我們應該不把自己拘於小的地方，最好能隨時隨地的觀察了解，着手我們的新事業。」</p>
<p>「不，不是這末說法，都市裏的人要比鄕村中的人險惡多了，鄕村中的人誠實，懇切，淳厚，和他們接近便使人感覺舒適。我愛他們，因此我留戀鄕村。……假使有機會脫離商界的話，我便立刻要回去，我的最大的理想是在鄕下辦一所小學校。鄉下的孩子是尤其可愛的，你想伴着這一羣孩子在那瓦屋粉牆，田園畫的環境中時讀時玩，是多麼的有趣？除此以外，還可以組織農村合作社，改良農業，比方購買機器租給農民使用等。我相信這樣下去，不到多時，我們本鄕便可以敎育普及，農民當有，產業發達，成爲一個模範區，那末推廣起來，便能由鄕及縣，由縣及省而及全國了」。〇君說完，眼裏閃出光彩來，從道眼裏我看見他底對農村改進的雖幼稚而實虔誠的熱忱</p>
<p>我不忍再以言去打消他底熱忱，令他跌出理想圈外：同時我有點被他引起對於家鄉的憶念：因此我沉默了。</p>
<p>在沉默中，我看見了闊別七年的故鄕的人物：被毀的庭園中長着凄淸的野草，而不幸被難的老人底墳頭只受着原野之風的憑弔！田畝荒蕪却加熏了租賦，在無聲的掙扎中有貧農帶着哀怨死去了。勞苦的工作與組暴的對待使孩子都變得懦弱而愚昧。幸福，溫愛，對他們只是永遠的美麗的幻夢而已。……難忘的憶念啊，長久地給了我以重壓！</p>
<p>在沉默巾我抬起頭來。不禁否認地說：「沒有這末容易，一地方決不能和別地方隔　開來單獨地改革；在整個農村破產的當兒，你一個鄕村組織合作社等，便能改進人民的生活了嗎？至於你說呌農民租用機器以利耕種，也不會對他們有什麼好處，不過，事實上，這些也還只是理想而已。……在困苦生活的壓迫之下，鄕村中的人將更不熏視於子女的敎育，但是，在這一點上，你底在鄕村創辦學校，的確是値得努力的。」終於一種不安的心理逼着我說出這些話來，我以爲這樣即使令他多失望一點，也還是有意義的。</p>
<p>他不再說什麽。我知這他又在對自己的理想發生懷疑了。他素來是這樣的：當他不能確信自己的話的時候，他會苦苦地思索，矛盾在襲擊着他，他於是不能有所解決。</p>
<p>我拍拍他底眉頭，安慰着他：「一個人對於某件事有着堅執的信心，那做出來的力量是可驚的。我相信你一定能在不久敎育出一般鄕村中的有爲的少年，並且對農村有切實的改進。」</p>
<p>他微笑了。他閃爍着那雙沉　的眼，滿含熱望地說：「是的，現在鄕村中最壞的人便是那班老頑固，他們爲非作惡，而且不容許，一切新的灌輸；但只要我努力下去，待到二十年後，老頑固們死去了，新的一代長成了，我也可以看出自己的不小的</p>
<p>暮色漸深，梧桐葉流着暗綠，疏星在晴空閃動着淡的光亮，一如在我心底所閃動着的。</p>
<p>「我們也許不會合作，但我們總是要好的朋友！」他忽然閒口了·面上流露着凄凉的欣慰。這起初給我以驚異，但一會兒我便明白它底意義了。</p>
<p>「是的，我們永遠是要好的朋友。」我實說着</p>
<p>在一個廣闊着茫的十字路口，我們分手了。</p>
<p>我向着家裏走去。看前面一抹沉沉的黑暗裏透出幾點黃火，——都市的防空之夜啊！</p>
<p>「都市是這樣，但鄕村又如何呢？」我默默自語着，心頭揚起一片飄零遊子的孤獨感。</p>

<h3>鐕鐕</h3>
<p>— 陳世聰</p>
<p>在我的診室裏，時常聽到病孩的啼哭，呌、囂，我的心緒便會因之不寗，覺得非常的厭煩，所以，我對於孩子們是無甚好感的。</p>
<p>是去年丹桂飄香的季節，我的長女—鑽鐕誕生了。她跟別的孩子一標會哭會呌，不過，我一却些不覺得厭煩，憤恨，反而會把她的哭呌，比作悅耳的爵士歌聲，並且，我還想盡種種的方法逗引她，有時更會裝狗裝貓的哄她，我對鐕鑽竟有這樣的好耐心，却是從朱施之於別的孩子。</p>
<p>自幼我的　相是極壞的，把棉被跌在床下，是常有的事，我因愛錯　，時常喜歡把她撲在懷裏一同睡着，我却一次也未曾把她跌痛或壓痛邊，有時一只手將要壓到她的身上時，我就會很敏感的驚醒。</p>
<p>父母們的叮囑，朋友們的囑托，我都曾遺忘過甚或推却過，但我對鑽鑽却不問了。我曾爲要替她買一磅紅色的毛冷，竟會跑遍了興聖街，結果尙是輾轉托了朋友，出了高價向黑市中覓得。爲要買橡皮的乳頭，我也會問了十多家藥房，走過百貨公司，在陳列的櫥窗裏，我特別留意的是兒童用品。有一次，我見到一件紅色的童裝，式樣是非常的新穎，美觀，不過，這是六七歲的小孩穿的，鑽鑽必要等四五年才能穿的，我也竟會把它買了。我發自衷心地願爲鑽鑽服役，我一些也不想酬報，我祇希望她長成，健康，美麗，活潑。</p>
<p>但是，不如意事常八九，在五月十七的那天，鑽鑽竟棄我而去了。她病時僅是患赤眼。我祇略於施治，而不甚介意的，病勢竟在一二天內，急遽的惡化，使我措手不及，無法診治，看着她呼了最後的一口氣，我痛哭，我悔恨，我的心片片碎了。我旣是一個職司生命的醫者，而不能挽救我那心愛的寶貝，我懷疑我的醫術，我想以後不再從醫，不過，我知道這是太消極了，我還年靑，我要更積極的幹，我須要精研我的醫術，救愈垂危的病孩們，別再創痛她們父母的心，也可聊以安慰我那已受了創痛的心了。</p>
<p>診室裏的病孩，依靠一樣的啼哭，呌囂，現在，我的心却一些也不覺到厭煩而不寗了。反覺得非常安閒，很耐心於我的診斷。</p>
<p>「幼吾幼以及人之幼，確是一句不刊的經文，眞是一定要自己有了幼兒，才知道幼及人之幼的啊！</p>

<h3>體育　小足球之蓬勃</h3>
<p>今夏適合時令之網球及游泳遝動，極見冷寂，而素不爲球迷所注意之小型足球，則有意外蓬勃。良以網球一物，代價過昂。游泳一項，則以游泳池缺乏，乃因之面少迅展矣。小型足球則爲輕而易舉，遂有緊彼就此之現象。計舉辦小型球盃賽者，有六七種之多，每盃賽加入隊伍，總屬超過預算，盛極一時，亦點綴滬上體育界之夏季風光。</p>
<h3>四强今日決鬥</h3>
<p>上海小足球聯合會主辦之首屆小型球聯賽，自上月八日展幕以來，在談熹沈　春鄧效良黃仁彝等熱心服務之下，進行順利，業已晋入最後階段。各組均於今日起展開總法賽局而，有規組兩塲決賽，俱爲小型球之翹楚，預料不可　動一時</p>
<p>記者不憚煩作甲組四隊實力之剖視及預測。今日爲維持　秩序起見，及爲小足球聯合會此次比賽完全不售門票，而借用靑年聯誼社塲地，亦係免費。但經逐次比賽，損壞極多，故今賽酌售門票五十元及一百元兩極，將悉數爲補償該會修理塲地費之用。先述今日甲組決賽秩序：</p>
<p>聯誼——旋迥（甲一部決）下午五時</p>
<p>華通——合羣（甲組總決）下午六時</p>
<h3>聯誼諸將經騐豐富</h3>
<p>聯誼與旋迥，因在一部中積分相等，故今日決奪一部皇座。按兩隊一度相遇，旋迥克服聯誼，唯不幸敗於法商，乃造成今日之重賽，亦予聯誼正好復仇之良機。觀兩隊實力，聯誼與足球風相同，利用其體格之魁梧，盡大刀闊斧之能事。麾下爲第一流名將，如劉顯漢李天生宋靈聖鄭英權許文奎等，滬上球迷無不知之。而近自港來各後衛嚴士參風間來歸。故全隊人材，無懈可擊。再談旋逥，在小型球界活躍異常，以此最近表演純熟異常，輕挑微　，入絲入扣，妙不可言。尤以　以撤羅壽福麥爾森三將，利用其身段之伶俐，東竄西避，有獨到之處，可稱細膩。故以演出而論，旋迥較聯誼可觀。然勝負之判，尙須有各方面之推動，而聯誼諸將之經騐豐富，臨陣有謀，此番又爲復九起見，自必羣策羣力，博取勝利也。故今日之勝負，實難預卜也。</p>
<h3>華通合羣旗鼓相當</h3>
<p>華通爲甲二部之霸主，合羣爲三部之翹首。緣華通本屆對於小型球有興奮之情緖，良好之成績，特邀法凡笑爲敎練，朝刺訓導。果爾成績極見進境，全隊於聯絡方面，頗爲　默。各個球藝，亦有顯著之進步。周麒麟孟義良更有當年全盛之氣槪，可開在蔗境階段。返　合羣諸將，胥爲戴麟經創設足球訓練班中之傑出人材，此番阿戴親自出馬，統率門牆桃李，且有嘉興趕來之小球鐵門董錦才參戰，錦上添花。其作戰因素遞承一隊者，故漏洞極少，知彼知己，自屬有上好之球藝搊人也。與華通旗鼓相當，必有其精湛演出，緊張過程。</p>
<p>總之，今日兩幕大戰，均爲小型足球之能手，亦有盛名於足球界，小型球別有一番看頭。凡我球迷，盍興乎來，且靑年聯誼社球塲，環境幽美，則偕友侶數人，作爲假日之公園遊憩，亦無不可。</p>
<h3>今晨壘球大賽　熊貓戰葡隊　勝菲僑在梁友聲一棒</h3>
<p>西人獨霸之壘球聯賽，今夏自我華人勁旅熊貓（Pandas加入以來，每戰必勝。上星期日在對菲僑（F．M．U．Knights）之一役中，熊貓威力，發揮無遺。在極度緊張及苦戰下，以一分之差壓倒菲僑爲梁友聲一棒之功。在塲萬千球迷，莫不雀躍三百。如此熊貓對冠軍之希望，已日趨濃厚。</p>
<h3>今日</h3>
<p>（二十七日熊貓將出戰葡商紅（Lusitano　Reds）査葡商紅為上屆冠軍，彼必將拚死，一決雌雄。同時我華隊為欲使我華人爭光及奪標起見，亦必全力以爭，嚴陣以待。球迷可於九時三刻往膠州公園（不收門票）觀之。同時可爲我華人棒塲。</p>
<h3>熊貓</h3>
<p>今日出擊最應注意者，乃葡隊將利用短擊（Short　bump）上壘。因彼等已知華隊之外翼不可欺。在對菲僑一役中，華隊僅以二比一獲勝。可知是賽，雙方已盡防守之能事。尤其是熊貓之外翼，均八面玲瓏。菲隊有巴莎，泰山及唐喬斯之猛擊。最險莫如在第四及七局中，在第四局華隊外實連接菲隊之高球二次，一次爲唐偉業妙接，另一次為勞兆森接獲巴莎所擊出之冷門球·又如在第七局巾，華隊已占先一分，輪至唐喬斯出擊，又一個外翼球，被唐偉業謹愼接獲，否則必成全壘打而與華隊和局。故今日對付葡隊之短擊有一法，即葡隊短擊之球乃沿一壘綫者，此時投手可假意追球而在上壘者（Runner）之前面走過，同時一壘手可衝前搶球投擲一壘而由二壘手塡空（Cover）一壘接之，如此球必先到壘也。因上壘者經投手在面前走過，必心慌而慢步。（投手在上壘者面前走過並不犯規，只須不撞身或故意阻碍，故並非Blocking也。）而同時一壘手可從容投至一壘矣。華隊不妨採用此法，以制葡隊。同時在戰菲僑一役中，捕手王慶瑞欠鎭靜，如在第五局，因其誤擲二壘而使在三壘之菲隊員乘隙歸壘，實因慌張所致。今日敵隊均善走壘，宜謹愼從事爲要。此外熊貓全隊只有盧兆森，梁友聲，王秀山，溫瑞雄諸人擊球稍佳。觀乎在上週一戰中，膚君之二次妙擊，及梁友聲在第四局中之巧妙短擊而使在二三壘之盧兆森及王慶瑞（黃應瑞之誤）帶歸，奠定勝局，尤爲難能可貴。不過最近溫瑞雄似在退步，在上週一戰曾漏接二次擊出之球。反之，一壘手王念祖似有進步，非如以前常慢　及亂接也。</p>
<h3>上海體育會網球賽　蔡國基勝H柯拉沙</h3>
<p>上海體育會（即前跑馬廳）主辦之會友讓分網球賽，於七月揭幕，因廟會友性質，故外界知者極鮮。日前（二十五日）有一幕，緊張之單打賽，承瞿兆鴻君電邀，故欣然往觀。與賽者爲華人後起名將一祭國基對老將H柯拉沙，因二人同隸A級，故並不讓分。柯拉沙素有牛皮糖之稱，能攻能守，經騐豐富，而祭邇來一日千里，進境甚速，對於長抽及上網，均有功夫。柯雖狡猾，竟爲所克，殊屬可喜。聊足爲今夏網球　無消息中之點綴耳。附祭勝柯之成績。（潔）蔡國基六——四四——六六——四H柯拉沙</p>

        <h1>1944.08.27</h1>
<h3>Certain Victory Politics</h3>
<p>— Tokutomi Sohō</p>
<p>What the people desire most is peace of mind. Peace of mind means trusting the authorities. Just as Confucius said, solving the food problem and the military problem to gain the trust of the people, maintaining peace and order under any serious circumstances, and serving with peace of mind—if these three are not in place, existence is impossible. This is the most appropriate motto for today.</p>
<p>Lord Takeda Shingen was a great statesman who gained peace of mind from the people. This was because people believed, "Working under Lord Shingen is absolutely reassuring. There is no worry about robbery or enemy soldiers, and it is possible to live well and safely." Lord Shingen's greatness as a statesman lies in this point, and not because he implemented rent reduction and tax exemption policies. His slogan was: "People are the castle, people are the wall." Other warlords built castles, but he made ships and did not build castles. But this is not an easy thing to do. House rent, corvée labor, annual tributes, etc., were certainly quite harsh, but the people did not see it as a hardship. Everyone regarded him as the general manager or director of a company, and were very at ease. When a politician reaches this point, they can graduate. I hope that today's politicians can experience a little of his political psychology.</p>
<p>Today's politicians are making a big mistake if they do not investigate what the people want. Politicians who grasp the needs of flowers and trees will water them when they should be watered, fertilize them when they should be fertilized, prune them when they should be pruned, and weed them when they should be weeded; and just as doctors understand the needs of patients, they can then understand the true meaning of politics. There is a definite rule in politics: one must thoroughly investigate the psychology of the people, and one must act according to the rules. If one does not know the psychology of flowers and trees and still waters them on rainy days, then the flowers and trees will be in danger of being waterlogged. (But there are times when flowers and trees are watered on rainy days.) This is because one has not thought about the relationship of politics. Whether it is for the country on a large scale, or for a town or village on a small scale, it is all necessary.</p>
<p>Lord Shingen was a very studious person. After each war, he would always gather his family for self-reflection, just like a post-exercise critique. This is what made him extraordinary. Marshal Tōgō was also such a person. The reason why Japan won every battle was because it studied the gains from the previous Battle of the Yellow Sea. Initially, he wanted to use parallel tactics, but he completely changed and implemented T-shaped tactics. People generally say that this may have been the opinion of his staff, but Tōgō once told me, "I came up with it myself."</p>
<p>Although it is said that grasping the hearts of the people is very important, it is sometimes impossible in a world where materialism is all-powerful. When work stops, the gold-almighty method is used to win people's hearts with money, but this is not without limits. Let me give an example: in the Philadelphia factory, a strike occurred due to wage issues, and a large number of troops were dispatched to intervene. In Lloyd George's book "War Memoirs," their weaknesses are described. What truly makes people act is not money. Shingen's family member, Yamagata Saburōhyōe, was a very loyal person, but he did not hope for wealth or glory. When he heard that family members of the same rank in neighboring countries had three or four times more stipends, he was not moved at all. "Saburō's Diary" also mentions that Ōkubo Hikozaemon's stipend was only 3,000 koku. In stark contrast, Tachibana Hida-no-kami betrayed his master during the Battle of Sekigahara, but after returning, he received a stipend of 100,000 koku. Ōkubo Hikozaemon certainly said many dissatisfied words about his master, but he never betrayed him. This is because his master, Ieyasu, constantly praised him for his "hard work and great merit," and he was satisfied spiritually.</p>
<p>In recent years, people often talk about "eating one's fill." Originally, people cannot work on an empty stomach. If one is hungry but does not feel it, it is only temporary. Once or twice is not a problem, but if this continues, one cannot go to war. But there are two kinds of "eating one's fill": one is filling the stomach, and the other is filling the spirit. Akechi Mitsuhide went over to Nobunaga's side, only gorging himself, not stopping until he was bloated. He held castles and fiefs in places like Sakamoto, and people generally thought that he would wholeheartedly maintain his loyalty. Even Nobunaga thought that he had become a parvenu who would not rebel even if he was beaten and scolded. However, due to spiritual dissatisfaction, he finally turned around and bit his master. Lord Shingen knew this very clearly, so he allowed people to eat their fill in terms of stomach and in terms of spirit, and achieved unity from top to bottom, which is what is meant by "people are the castle, people are the wall."</p>
<p>The government often says that it is enough to make the people eat their fill, but if this is true, then the children of wealthy gentlemen should all become outstanding sages. Looking back at the facts, haven't many great men come from poor families? This fact completely refutes the idea that everything will be fine as long as you eat your fill. It is the result of spiritual effort that makes people great. Just as there is a Chinese saying, "A hungry belly produces strange plans," but if the hunger has passed, then the strange plans will not necessarily turn into bad plans, so it is still good to eat just enough.</p>
<p>It is a big mistake to think that we should use a lot of resources to deal with the enemy because they use a lot of resources to deal with us. Why did Japan achieve such great victories at the beginning of the war? It was because they had long ago arbitrarily assumed that they had abundant resources, but Japan's resources were not large. If Britain and the United States jointly made a threatening gesture, then Japan would definitely submit. That is to say, they believed too much in resources and looked down on spirit. However, Japan neglected resources, rose up in anger, and achieved great victories at Pearl Harbor and off the coast of Malaya. Of course, we cannot say that resources are not needed, but what we rely on is exploiting the enemy's erroneous strategy. They believed that Japan could not win even if it fought for a hundred years. As people generally say, essence and spirit are one. Filling both the stomach and the spirit is necessary in any situation. Of course, resources must also be sufficient. If there is a shortage of resources, then it is absolutely necessary to supplement them with spirit.</p>
<p>Once the will is determined, it doesn't matter whether you fight outside the door, at the door, or even inside the house. The point is that as long as you beat them to a pulp, that's fine. Japan doesn't have to particularly climb mountains and wade through water. It is such a blessing from heaven to be able to wait at ease for the enemy to tire themselves out. Therefore, our current task as Japanese people is to uphold our belief in certain victory and to strike blows. The longer we fight, the stronger we become. They are a paper tiger, and they will be finished as soon as it rains. Therefore, they are attacking with all their might during the period when it is not raining. They are not human beings, but animals. They believe that if they don't strike quickly, they will be trembling with fear inside. Whether victory or defeat is determined by a long-term war or a short-term war depends entirely on the extent of the Japanese people's perseverance.</p>
<p>The main thing is to unite matter and spirit, to consider the satisfaction of both spirit and resources, and to move forward. When the spirit is exhausted, replenish it. It is enough to replenish it to the point where the enemy cannot take advantage of it. Japan's greatest weapon is not airplanes or tanks, but endurance, the replenishment of spirit. If we can endure, then even if the enemy can force their way forward, the closer the enemy gets by an inch, the closer our Japanese victory gets by an inch. So there is no need to panic, but to be calm, and only to strike the enemy. I hope that everyone will be determined to have this spirit.</p>

<h3>Youth Life Camp - Held Graduation Ceremony Yesterday - Acting Chairman Chen Attended and Presided</h3>

<h3>German Army Group on the Border - Preparing for a Decisive Battle - Anti-Axis Powers Strengthen Diplomatic Encirclement</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. The armistice treaty concluded by the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union with Romania has been signed. Since the 23rd, the Romanian army on the Iasi front has ceased resistance. The Soviet army advanced 150 kilometers southeast in one day on the 23rd, and its mechanized units have broken into a corner of the new border of Outer Transylvania, as defined in the Vienna Award. It appears that they intend to cut off the retreat route of the German army east of Iasi. Therefore, the German army in that area is now in danger of encirclement. However, this unit has strong combat power, and with the cooperation of the German army from the Hungarian side, it is not difficult to break through the Soviet encirclement. The Romanian coup regime is said to have recognized the border line of the Vienna Award, and it is possible that the Romanian army will occupy Outer Transylvania, Hungarian territory according to the Vienna Award. The Hungarian government also has this prediction and is concentrating its main forces to strengthen diplomatic encirclement, aiming to end the European war in a short period of time. As this trend gradually becomes apparent, the diplomatic situation is extremely urgent. After Romania's defection, the bases for bombing Germany are closer than those in Italy and France, which is actually unfavorable to Germany. However, the German High Command had long incorporated this attempt by the Anti-Axis forces into its plans and transferred large forces into German territory, determined to continue resisting. Therefore, the various situations mentioned above do not have any major impact on the fundamental strategy of the German army's operations.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Attempts to Conceal Continuing Defeats</h3>
<p>Central Shanghai News. The fall of Hengyang was a severe blow to Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities are still concealing the fact that the military commander and others surrendered. This can be clearly seen from the memorial services for the fallen soldiers of Hengyang held in various places. Recently, in order to reverse the decline in public morale and the psychological fatigue of the war, they have been heavily promoting the operations to recover Hengyang and the counter-offensive operations in Hubei. They also claimed that after the Japanese army withdrew from Myitkyina, the Chongqing army would soon advance on the Burma front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 25th that a part of the Chongqing army had recently launched a counter-offensive in the Yichang area, with the aim of easing the pressure from the Japanese army in Hunan.</p>
<h3>Balkan States' Trends - Turkey</h3>
<p>Beijing, Central News Agency Dispatch, Huitong Agency Report, News from Istanbul: The Turkish Cabinet held a meeting yesterday morning. Prime Minister Laçoglu… Central News Agency Dispatch, According to Ankara: The Turkish government has decided to recall its ambassador to the Vichy government, Mr. Yerien.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Berlin, Central News Agency Dispatch. According to Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister General Bagryanov, Foreign Minister Draganov, and Army Chief Lieutenant General Luyev held an important meeting the other day.</p>
<p>Sofia, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. After the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, the Soviet army immediately attacked Romania. At the same time, the Bulgarian Prime Minister also issued an important statement. The military and political situation in the Balkans seems to be undergoing great upheaval. In short, Bulgaria maintains an alliance with Germany on the one hand, declares war on the United Kingdom and the United States on the other hand, and also has increasing conflicts with the Soviet Union due to its Slavic heritage. The direct cause of this evolution is the change in the war situation between the Axis and Anti-Axis powers. Bulgaria's current situation is like a candle in the wind, and its only hope is that the German army can reverse the war situation.</p>
<h3>To Rescue the Critically Endangered Nation - Engage in Labor Service - Leader's Address at the Graduation Ceremony of the Life Camp</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency Dispatch, 26th. The New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp held its graduation ceremony on the afternoon of the 26th. Acting Chairman Chen attended and presided over the event. The original text of the leader's address is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Mental Labor and Physical Labor Are No Different</h3>
<p>"At the graduation ceremony of the second session of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp, all the students braved the hot weather and came from all over to the life camp to receive rigorous training, and every day they have to go to the farm to do labor service. This spirit is truly commendable.</p>
<p>There used to be a saying that 'those who labor with their minds govern others, and those who labor with their bodies are governed by others,' dividing mental labor and physical labor into two classes, 'one above and one below. This is really a feudal-era concept. There are many reasons for our country's weakness, but this point cannot be said to be one of the reasons. It must be known that although the departments of intelligence and physical strength are different, the gains of labor and the gains of the mind are no different in their contribution to the nation and the people. Moreover, without a labor consciousness, no matter how one labors with their mind, it is impossible to survive in today's world. What's more, since the war, our country's production has been devastated. If the whole country does not invigorate its spirit and catch up quickly, the future of the nation will be even more unthinkable.</p>
<h3>Unite and Advance to Liberate East Asia</h3>
<p>The holding of the New National Movement Youth Summer Labor and Life Camp is aimed at the above-mentioned phenomenon, with labor service as the training center, aiming to cultivate the students' habits of labor service life and take on the important mission of increasing production. Therefore, in addition to ideological training and military training, we should also emphasize skills training. I have already said this at the graduation ceremony of the last session, but all the students should always remember that the main purpose of our current labor service is to rescue our critically endangered nation. Therefore, we are engaged in labor service not for personal gain, but for the welfare of the nation, for the liberation of East Asia. It is not something that can be accomplished by individuals doing it piecemeal. We must unite and advance with one mind, in order to rescue the nation from this extremely difficult situation and liberate East Asia. This labor and life camp selects outstanding youths from all over to live together, live the same life, do the same labor, abide by the same discipline, and establish the same central idea. This is precisely to concentrate our will, enrich our strength, and combine the wisdom of all to seek the survival of all.</p>
<h3>Increase Production Through Labor to Protect the Nation</h3>
<p>Our country was originally an agricultural country. Before the war, our country's food supply was insufficient. The rice and wheat imported through customs every year accounted for a large proportion. After the war, the fields were deserted, and bandits roamed rampant, further reducing production. Therefore, people's livelihoods were difficult and could not be addressed. At present, we cannot delay the work of increasing production, and modern warfare is total war. In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, it is even more necessary to increase production. Practicing labor service to protect the nation is not an empty slogan. When we are engaged in labor service, we must recognize that increasing production, enriching national strength, and developing national power are the main goals. Only by enriching national strength and developing national power can we complete the mission of restoring China and share the responsibility of defending East Asia.</p>
<p>The urgently needed training at present is a key point of the New National Movement work this year. During the summer vacation, there are similar organizations in the central government and in various places, which are naturally very necessary. Due to various reasons such as transportation and equipment in the central government, the total number of students in the first and second sessions is only over 200. There are still many youths across the country who hope to receive this kind of training but have no opportunity to come to the central government for training. We hope that starting with you comrades, after leaving the camp, you comrades will spread this spirit to various places, creating a trend so that the youth of the whole country, the people of the whole country, can conscientiously engage in labor service and take on the work of enriching national strength and developing national power. I think if we can achieve this goal, China will definitely be able to be restored, and East Asia will definitely be able to be liberated. You comrades have received training for three weeks. Although the time is short, the responsibility is extremely great. The day of graduation is the time when work begins. I hope you will be brave and vigorous, diligent and hardworking, and unite with the youth of the whole country to shoulder the mission of the times for the restoration of China and the defense of East Asia."</p>

Before the enemy troops invaded, thugs under the instigation of the British and Americans had already caused significant damage to the urban area. The German defense forces have established positions in the city center, and the German commander, Trierte, has refused to accept the enemy's request to surrender. The great battle in the Normandy region northwest of Paris is still ongoing, and the German army is still fighting fiercely with the enemy according to plan to seek a way out.

<h3>Police Bureau Cracks Down on Two Opium Dens in Nanshi, Continues to Eliminate Opium and Drugs in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau, guided by the National Government's anti-drug order, established a narcotics investigation section to specialize in the investigation and crackdown on opium and drugs in the urban area. Recently, it was found that there were still secret opium dens in the Nanshi area, providing opium and drugs for customers to smoke. The relevant branch bureaus were ordered to warn them to close down. However, some unscrupulous people took the opportunity to falsely use the name of the section to solicit protection fees from opium dens, claiming to bribe the authorities. The authorities were very angry when they learned about the situation and immediately sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation. It was learned that the owners of the Hongyuan Opium Den, Du Chao, and the Fuxing Opium Den, Bian Zucai (alias Bian Zhongli), were responsible. At 6 pm on the 25th, the head of the narcotics investigation section was ordered to lead detectives to search the Hongyuan Opium Den at 123 Luxiangyuan Road, Nanshi, and the Fuxing Opium Den at 38 Luxiangyuan Road.

The Fuxing Opium Den had three rooms, and 28 opium smokers, including Xia Chenshi, were arrested, along with six opium pipes, eight opium bowls, and other paraphernalia. All the people and paraphernalia were taken to the bureau for interrogation. However, Du and Bian were not arrested because they were not present. The section has issued an order to all branch bureaus to investigate and arrest them. After the investigation of the arrested opium offenders is completed, they will be handed over to the district prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Firewood Prices Soar, Unified Purchase and Sale Imminent</h3>
<p>Recently, firewood prices in the city have suddenly soared. Although there are many reasons for this, the main reason is speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. Taking firewood as an example, its price has exceeded the evaluation price by 20%. The authorities, in view of this phenomenon, cannot allow it to persist and have decided on a unified management method to curb firewood prices. The implementation will involve centralized purchase and sale of firewood. First, all businesses will be ordered to register the quantity of firewood they purchase, designate wharves for loading, and the Central Market will send personnel to supervise and manage the purchase and sale in a unified manner. The prices will also be determined by the evaluation office to prevent manipulation by unscrupulous merchants. It is reported that this method has been submitted to the Standing Committee of the Municipal Government and will be implemented in the short term. Also, according to the Central Market's evaluation of firewood prices for the second half of this month, which was announced as follows: Chestnut firewood 800 yuan, poplar firewood 640 yuan, pine firewood 750 yuan, rice firewood 450 yuan, bean chaff 700 yuan, elm firewood 720 yuan, mulberry firewood 640 yuan, miscellaneous firewood 700 yuan, flower chaff firewood 640 yuan, wheat firewood 360 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anti-Smoking Hospital Begins to Admit People Who Want to Quit Smoking</h3>

It is reported that the hospital will soon admit people aged 20 to 30 who are sent by the Anti-Smoking General Bureau of the Ministry of Interior.

After strict negotiations with the manufacturer, the licenses can be delivered by Saturday this week. From the 28th of this month (Monday), they can definitely be issued. New purchasers must bring their invoices (or other proof documents) and fill out an application form at the vehicle registration office under their jurisdiction to register and issue the license."</p>

<h3>Important Information About Air Raid Defense</h3>
<p>Preparation Under Alarm</p>
<p>Some people think that it is enough to engage in the work of alarm at the time of the issuance of the alert alarm, and at this time do not have the thought that the air raid alarm will continue to be issued, that is, once the air raid alarm is issued, they will start to engage in air raid measures, which must take a considerable amount of time, so when the alert medical report is issued, thinking that there is still considerable time before the air raid alarm is issued is a very wrong concept that should be corrected. Also, it should be noted that sometimes after the issuance of the alert alarm and the air raid alarm, a sudden air raid is encountered, and an air raid alarm is issued in an instant, sometimes it can immediately become an air raid alarm posture, and an air raid posture, so it should also be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>Implementation of Lighting Control</p>
<p>Lighting control must still be actively implemented in the future. Even a slight leakage of light can guide enemy aircraft, so it should be properly shielded. In addition to checking family members, neighbors should also share responsibility and check for light leaks to avoid unexpected misfortunes. Because a very small amount of light leaking due to carelessness will not only cause damage to oneself, but if the enemy drops incendiary bombs, it will inevitably cause a fire and obtain materials for judgment, so lighting control should be strictly observed. The outline of implementing lighting control: At the time of the issuance of the alert alarm, some residual lights can still be left, but at the time of the air raid alarm, the lights should be turned off immediately. However, when the residual lights are dimmed, the responsible persons of the neighbors, members of the fire prevention group, members of the Baojia group, etc., should be responsible. Of course, during an air raid alarm, if the lights can be completely hidden, even if the lights are not turned off, it is acceptable, but this should be thoroughly and strictly implemented. If the lights are completely hidden, but there is still light leaking, it is necessary to thoroughly inspect the lighting control materials at this time. At the same time, for the sake of complete safety, except for necessary lights, all other lights should be turned off.</p>
<p>Completion of Shelters</p>
<p>During an air raid, in addition to being directly hit by a bomb, if you can hide in a trench about ten meters away from where the bomb lands, you can avoid being injured. From this point of view, it is necessary to set up a complete shelter, which should be set up underground in principle. 1. When setting up outside, if there is a place where collapsing objects may fall, such as near the 着前, and there is no cover, it is dangerous. If there is no way, it should be covered with 被等. In this way, when bricks and tiles fall, some damage can be avoided. 2. When setting up indoors, an exit must be built, and if possible, there should be a device in the trench that can break through and come out from below when the house collapses. 3. When building an air raid shelter, pay full attention and select a suitable location. It is impossible to dig a trench underground, so it can also be on the ground. However, at this time, use soil or a wooden frame filled with soil as a cover, which is necessary because when an air raid encounters a landmine bomb, it can stir up a lot of soil and sand, and to prevent the falling of fragments of anti-aircraft artillery shells. Cover with two or three inches of rough wood on both sides of the hole, each about a foot high, and place wooden boards or soil on top of it. When hiding in an uncovered shelter, you must cover your body with quilts, etc. When building a shelter, try to limit it to one that can accommodate a small number of people so that the damage can be minimized when directly hit by a bomb. Also, the distance of building a shelter should be as far apart as possible. This trench should not only be used by family members, but also by passersby</p>
<p>Prevent the Spread of Rumors</p>
<p>When enemy aircraft attack, in order to prevent espionage, the following points must be paid special attention to: It is extremely dangerous to reveal careless words with half-knowledge and ignorance of the truth, so it should be strictly avoided. Writing about the damage caused by air raids in letters is enough to cause the spread of rumors, so you should pay full attention, trust the announcements of the authorities, do not lightly believe in unfounded rumors, and strive to eliminate the spread of rumors. When air control has become a reality, we should move away from formal basic training and adopt training that adapts to actual combat so that we can exert the greatest effectiveness in an emergency (end). Don't underestimate the meaning of unity and collectivity</p>
<h3>Reader Scholarship News, Children Sympathize with Children, Don't Underestimate the Meaning of Unity and Collectivity</h3>
<p>The occurrence of human sympathy is, after all, the most natural instinct. We have more clearly confirmed this from the flourishing scholarship movement. There are many examples, too numerous to mention. Yesterday, we received a letter from all the fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School, initiating a one-day saving of candy money to raise 1,000 yuan to donate to the scholarship fund. The original two said: "Dear Sir: We are all fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School. The first lesson in this year's textbook is "A Girl Who Can't Read." After reading it, we all deeply feel that it is very painful not to be able to read. At the same time, we also feel that we are very happy. During this summer vacation, we also have the opportunity to take remedial classes, which makes us sympathize with many good students who have dropped out of school. Therefore, we initiated a one-day saving of candy money, and everyone gathered to donate to your newspaper as a scholarship fund. Although it is only a small 1,000 yuan, we think that if every school in Shanghai, every grade has 1,000 yuan to donate as a scholarship fund, it must be a considerable amount! Gentlemen, you are serving the ancient students, we wish you good health here. The fifth-grade students of Runhua Elementary School together." Although the amount of the subsidy is not large, the sympathy of the children is very valuable. Moreover, it is especially rare that the children can jointly initiate savings for scholarships and the meaning of unity and collectivity. If this meaning can be expanded and enlarged, the future of education will be promising, and the future of the country is even more expected. Don't underestimate it!</p>
<h3>Various Schools Set Up Free Enrollment Quotas</h3>

The schedule has been arranged by this newspaper, and the checks will be carried out daily from yesterday (the 25th). Please make sure that the students go on the scheduled date. Also, for the sake of seriousness, it is best for parents to accompany them, because the knowledge of elementary school students is still childish. If there are parents nearby, the hospital will be more likely to understand when explaining or guiding health, which will be of great benefit. In order to avoid crowding, the hospital has slightly advanced the check-up time. It can start at 1:30 pm every day. Please pay attention. Yesterday's Scholarship Received</p>

<h3>Steel-like Air Defense Factories</h3>
<p>The enemy, having occupied Saipan, is now attempting to invade Guam. One hundred million people, conserving their energy, are holding back their breath, suppressing the raging fire in their hearts, and desperately producing weapons for revenge. But the arrogant enemy, attempting to destroy our Japanese "revenge blades," has begun bombing Japanese factories. Although Japan is being subjected to air raids, there is absolutely no question of stopping production. However, if the factory's air defense equipment is not complete, there can be no hope of increasing production. ... Not long ago, the police department issued to all factories under its jurisdiction "Essential Points for Emergency Improvement and Strengthening of Factory Air Defense Capabilities." Of course, without waiting for government urging, they are being reorganized into air defense positions like copper-iron battleships that are not at all afraid of air raids. "Let the enemy come if they want!" But production will never be hindered by this. Three factories that express this strong determination: Japan Optical Manufacturing, Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory, and Nakajima Aircraft Factory. Now, let's temporarily examine them. Below is how to learn about the production air defense methods of air defense factories.</p>
<h3>Japan Optical Manufacturing</h3>
<p>It has been a long time since the slogan "Air raids are inevitable" was loudly proclaimed. This Japan Optical Manufacturing is the first to be completed. As for the air defense equipment of this factory being so complete, it must be said that it is due to the enthusiasm of the fifth-generation factory director, Mr. Godai. Mr. Godai walks around the factory, and whatever he deems necessary for air defense equipment, he instructs to be implemented. The birth of the protection team was also after the start of the Greater East Asia War. The protection team acts according to the director's intentions, and now it has achieved good results.</p>
<p>The first thing that catches the eye is that the factory is fully equipped with light-shielding facilities everywhere, so that there is no obstacle to working under air raids. Now it is closed from the side, but it will be further modified to be completely　　 from top to bottom. In addition, the shelters are underground rooms fifty meters long and three meters wide, which can accommodate two hundred and fifty people. There are also sixty covered shelters that can accommodate from one person to ten people, and shelters made of sandbags are built in each workshop. In addition, there are twenty simple indoor shelters in workshops for those who remain in the workshop to carry out fire prevention and firefighting. Among them, what the manufacturing plant emphasizes is bulletproof equipment. In each workshop of the factory, in order to protect important machinery and various equipment, the earthen walls and sluice gates are packaged with wooden boards and iron plates to form bulletproof equipment. If there is "have something to rely on and not be afraid" bulletproof equipment, you will feel the safety of production under real air raids. In addition, the headquarters of the protection group and the air defense surveillance station are firmly protected by thick bulletproof walls. When implementing this air defense facility, how was the material and labor that were lacking dealt with? This most serious problem is inevitably encountered by any factory. The materials from old buildings that were evacuated nearby are used. As for labor, it is provided by all personnel within the manufacturing plant—especially those in administrative positions. Thirty to forty people per day form a labor service team, desperately building bulletproof walls and digging shelters.</p>
<p>Due to the resourcefulness of materials, the self-sufficiency of labor, and the expertise of factory executives, these three promote each other, and two air defense facilities have been completed. This is an example of how to clarify that there is no reason why air defense facilities cannot be completed.</p>
<h3>Nakajima Aircraft Factory</h3>
<p>The director of Nakajima Aircraft Factory, Mr. Ando, ​​has made a final decision and resolutely reorganized air defense facilities. According to the labor and materials provided by factory employees, this facility must be prepared no matter what. All employees who responded to the director's enthusiasm carried shovels and began digging air-raid shelters. Although the director is an old man of sixty-one years old, he also set an example and desperately dug air-raid shelters. In addition, female employees each brought cloth from their homes, and in a flash, they sewed several sandbags. Then they removed non-essential items such as the ceiling of the cafeteria and the wall panels of the corridor, and the bulletproof equipment project was completed immediately. It started on July 13, but thanks to day and night labor enthusiasm, hundreds of shelters and bulletproof facilities to accommodate all employees were completed in just two days. Thus, overcoming the shortage of materials and labor, a great accomplishment was achieved in factory air defense facilities.</p>
<h3>Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory</h3>
<p>Hitachi Precision Machinery Factory officially prepared for factory air defense since July 1942. At that time, experts were hired from the castle construction headquarters, and they completely obeyed their orders, instructions, and intentions. From February to March 1943, using the materials on hand, facilities such as bulletproofing, fire fighting, lighting control, shelters, poison prevention, and outlook were built. However, the special feature is lighting control. If a warning alarm is issued, the bells of each factory ring together, and in less than 0 minutes, this huge factory with a circumference of 0 kilometers completely disappears into the shadows in an instant. In order to achieve this result, the factory erected several standard-type roof vertical parts, that is, on the glass part of the skylight, about two-thirds of the outside is 　in black, and the inside is 　in white, and the remaining one-third is hung with a black　, with a large wooden frame placed on it. Usually and during the day, it is lifted, but when an alarm is issued, all the windows in the factory close at the same time. But these countless windows. It has already been stipulated who is responsible for shading　. On all the windows there is a wooden sign with a person's name, writing the black curtain and shading work. If you pay a little attention, you will know the thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>In addition, all the electric lights in the factory are surrounded by a two-foot black cylindrical air defense cover. In the past, 300-candlepower light bulbs were all changed to 100-candlepower light bulbs, which is also sufficient. At the entrances and exits, in order to illuminate the partial lighting, all are covered with a metal object. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun on July 26)</p>
<h3>Equatorial Scenery - Life in Sumatra</h3>
<p>— Kanezo Yano</p>
<p>Because I heard that going to the tropics requires good health maintenance, before I set off, I asked people who had lived there and read some books about tropical life. It is said that you should not eat sashimi (raw fish) in the south, you should not drink alcohol, and you should not drink cold water. In short, you should pay attention to your diet. However, later I did not follow any of these three prohibitions.</p>
<p>The sashimi in Padang is very delicious. I drink it with Indian Ocean sea bream and pomfret every night. The Indian Ocean coast has warm currents and sandy soil, and fish breed very abundantly, and the meat is also very fresh and delicious, but the fish tastes a little worse along the coast of Malacca because there is a lot of muddy ground. In addition, the eels and catfish produced there have scales or look scary. Even if they taste good, seeing their "fish appearance" makes me, who is the most fond of sashimi, lose my appetite. After arriving in Sumatra, on the Indian Ocean coast, from Sibolga to Padang, the products are fresh and fat. So I let go of my stomach and ate and ate.</p>
<p>As for water, there is a very good well in Padang, and everyone drinks it　嘟　嘟. It seems that no one boils it and cools it before drinking it in a hygienic way.</p>
<p>In short, life in the South is comparable to that of royalty. The food is rich and delicious, and I'm just afraid you don't have an appetite. However, one thing is very regrettable, that is, there is no home, which is too lonely and boring! Of course, you might as well take a book to relieve boredom in the evening or in your spare time, but you can't overcome the feeling of loneliness in this way.</p>
<p>Secret to health</p>
<p>Although the above three precepts are completely broken, I　also pay attention to the way of health, so as to remedy the carelessness in diet. The first item is to ride a horse every morning　. At dawn　wearing attire, facing the morning breeze of the Indian Ocean, walking slowly and galloping on the streets is really too pleasant. Sometimes when I met local children, I took them riding with me. Therefore, the children of Padang became very fond of me, and later became acquainted with their adults. This time they knew that I was going to return to China, and waited on the road early in the morning, giving me flowers and repeatedly inviting me to drink coffee. This went on for several days, which really made me happy and tired.</p>
<p>At that time, I did all the good health methods. Tennis and swimming, there was nothing I didn't do. I opened a pool in the official residence that was 40 meters wide and 20 meters wide, and introduced river water into it. I went swimming twice a week, and as a result, my face was tanned black.</p>
<p>Therefore, during my two years in office, I have never suffered from malaria or any tropical diseases, and I have never even had the appearance of being sick. You must be positive about everything, and you must be in awe of the disease demon.</p>
<p>What you must not do is binge drinking and overeating and staying up late—especially playing cards and chess all night. I hope that those who go to the South in the future will keep this in mind.</p>
<p>One of the things that I felt very moved by in my place of office was the situation of recruiting volunteers. On the day of the recruitment, more than ten times the quota of local people gathered in the square in front of the Padang government office, which was really surprising and delightful.</p>
<p>In particular, the Minangkabau people, who live in central Sumatra with Padang as their center, are the most intelligent ethnic group in Indonesia. They are very resentful of the former Dutch oppression and are very willing to cooperate with Japan. This is now in the midst of a dramatic war. There are few materials and many difficulties, but it is important to cooperate in combat at this time. In this way, the nation will develop in the future, so they are very enthusiastic. For example, when people who are eliminated due to poor physical strength always repeatedly ask, "Isn't the commander also wearing glasses?" "Aren't there also people wearing glasses among the Japanese soldiers?" There was also an applicant who was rejected because he was short. Because he was not convinced, he shouted, "What does it matter if I'm short? I'm very strong!" One of the examiners was a military member of the judo early stage. Hearing him say this, he stood up and threw him a somersault. After he got up, although he was a little ashamed, he still insisted on saying, "I am the representative of the village and cannot go back like this. Please give me a certificate!" He refused to go home empty-handed. Just from these points, you can know how full of enthusiasm their grand men's examination was.</p>
<p>Students teaching</p>
<p>The proficiency in Japanese is also surprising. What is interesting is that the lower the grade in middle school, the better the Japanese. Especially the first-year students in middle school have the best Japanese. Japanese is also taught in elementary schools. Since the Japanese army entered, teachers and students have started learning Japanese together. As a result, some teachers have to ask students to do translations. This is probably because children can concentrate on learning better than adults</p>
<p>Two years after I took office as the administrative governor of Sumatra, the medical letters sent to me by local people were sandwiched with Chinese characters, and they were written very well. This really surprised me. I boldly used Malay to deal with him, but he still answered in Japanese. The senior officials heard this and couldn't help but rejoice: "Hahaha, that's great! The popularity of Japanese to this extent is really amazing. In addition, this is the first time I have met someone like Governor Yano who can speak Malay. However, the Governor's Malay is not as good as the locals' Japanese. Haha." (Translated from the Asahi Weekly on July 23)</p>
<h3>Map of the French War Zone</h3>
<p>Fierce battles are currently taking place throughout France. The German and anti-Axis forces participating in the battle total about two million people. In the northern region, after fierce battles between anti-Axis armored units and German forces, they broke into the Paris city area from the west via Versailles and Cer, and from the south via Étampes and the Paris highway, and fierce street fighting broke out. In the southern region, the two ports of Toulon and Marseille continue to engage in fierce battles. The German army is containing a large number of enemy troops and is gradually carrying out a disengagement battle towards Lyon. Since the enemy forces landed in the Bay of Biscay, the German army's avoidance actions have been smooth.</p>

<h3>Reunion</h3>
<p>— Yifan</p>
<p>On a quiet road, I happened to meet my classmate 〇, whom I hadn't seen for more than a year.</p>
<p>He still had that melancholy face, and his body seemed even taller and thinner. He had a stack of notebooks under his arm, and I knew with joy and a slight sense of loss that he was a primary school teacher.</p>
<p>When you meet a friend who you once had fun with in a life of sorrow, will everyone exchange a sad smile in silence? But what about when you meet a friend who you once sighed with? I did not feel a deeper sorrow, I only chewed on our past again, and everything in the past seemed sweeter. In the past, we were not the most congenial friends, but we were close enough to be confidants, and this friendship was quite beautiful. Now, after a period of estrangement, we meet again on the poor road of displacement and suffering. Although I can't help but have tears in my eyes, my mood is happy and warm!</p>
<p>On this lonely road shrouded in dusk, we walked side by side, talking as the twilight sank around us.</p>
<p>He was always　silent, but this time he spoke a lot. His enthusiasm made me grateful.</p>
<p>"Children, lovely children"; he said excitedly, "They are so pure and innocent! Being with them, I only feel ashamed of myself, because my heart is at least no longer pure white. I can get great comfort from them, which far exceeds the hard work they give me. ... I love them with all my heart and kindness at all times, so none of them are close to me. Especially when I am a little sick, the children come to see me in groups of three or five, some say interesting words to comfort me, and some buy some food to send me. Ah, it makes me unspeakably happy to see this. ... Hey, it's really interesting." "Then you are very satisfied with your current life?" I asked, looking at his contemplative face.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's still good here, because our school has no branch principals or teachers, it's completely run by a few friends with the same interests, so there is no phenomenon of principals exploiting teachers. However, in order to make up for the meager income, I will have to give up teaching and go into business next semester. Alas, the business world, you see, what a filthy place? How can I climb down? ... The city, this sinful city, alas, I have long wanted to leave it, but because I can't bear to abandon this group of lovely children and this pure school, I have lingered. But now it is impossible to even stay here! Do you think I can not worry?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you have always hated this city, so you returned to your hometown once two years ago, but why did you finally come to Shanghai again?" I took the opportunity to rudely but enthusiastically rebuke him as a pastoral idealist.</p>
<p>"Alas, there's nothing I can do about it, because my family hopes that I will "develop" outside. They say that there is no future in the countryside; and what they call a future is to get promoted and make a fortune! Alas, I really don't understand why the minds of most young people's parents are so stubborn and corrupt. If this idea is not eradicated, China will not be saved for a day!" After he finished speaking indignantly, he shook his head repeatedly and sighed.</p>
<p>I also sighed sympathetically, but I could not agree with his consciousness of cherishing the countryside.</p>
<p>"What you said is right, but if we want to contribute a little to society, it is not necessarily limited to the countryside. In the city, the city and the countryside both have social ties and both need us to reform. We should not confine ourselves to small places, but should observe and understand at any time and place and start our new business."</p>
<p>"No, it's not that. People in the city are much more sinister than people in the countryside. People in the countryside are honest, earnest, and simple. Being close to them makes people feel comfortable. I love them, so I miss the countryside. ... If I have the opportunity to get out of the business world, I will go back immediately. My biggest ideal is to run a small school in the countryside. The children in the countryside are especially lovely. Do you think it would be so interesting to read and play with this group of children in that tile-roofed, white-walled, pastoral-painted environment? In addition to this, we can also organize rural cooperatives and improve agriculture, such as buying machines to rent to farmers. I believe that if we continue like this, it will not be long before education can be popularized in our hometown, farmers will be prosperous, industries will be developed, and it will become a model area. Then, if we promote it, we can go from the hometown to the county, from the county to the province, and to the whole country." After Mr. 〇 finished speaking, his eyes flashed with light. From those eyes, I saw his though naive but sincere enthusiasm for rural improvement.</p>
<p>I couldn't bear to use words to dispel his enthusiasm and make him fall out of the ideal circle: at the same time, I was a little aroused by his memories of my hometown: so I was silent.</p>
<p>In silence, I saw the people of my hometown whom I had not seen for seven years: wild grass grew in the destroyed garden, and the tomb of the unfortunate old man who died in the disaster was only consoled by the wind of the wilderness! The fields were barren but the rent was increased. In the silent struggle, poor farmers died with grief. Happiness and warmth are just beautiful dreams for them forever. ... Unforgettable memories, have given me heavy pressure for a long time!</p>
<p>In silence, I looked up. I couldn't help but deny and said: "It's not that easy. One place can never be reformed separately from other places; when the entire rural area is bankrupt, can you improve people's lives by organizing cooperatives in one rural area? As for you saying that you want farmers to rent machines to facilitate farming, it won't do them any good. However, in fact, these are just ideals. ... Under the oppression of a difficult life, people in the countryside will be even more indifferent to the education of their children, but in this respect, your starting a school in the countryside is indeed worth the effort." Finally, an uneasy feeling forced me to say these words, and I thought it would still be meaningful even if it disappointed him a little more.</p>
<p>He didn't say anything more. I knew that he was doubting his ideals again. He had always been like this: when he was not sure of his words, he would think hard, and contradictions would attack him, so he could not solve anything.</p>
<p>I patted his forehead and comforted him: "A person who has firm confidence in something can do amazing things. I believe that you will definitely be able to educate a group of promising young people in the countryside soon, and make practical improvements to the countryside."</p>
<p>He smiled. His sparkling eyes, full of hope, said: "Yes, the worst people in the countryside now are those old stubborns. They do evil and do not allow all new infusions; but as long as I work hard, when the old stubborns die in twenty years, the new generation will grow up, and I can see my own not small</p>
<p>As dusk deepened, the sycamore leaves flowed with dark green, and sparse stars shone with pale light in the clear sky, just like the ones that shone in my heart.</p>
<p>"We may not cooperate, but we will always be good friends!" He suddenly spoke casually, with a sad consolation on his face. This surprised me at first, but after a while I understood its meaning.</p>
<p>"Yes, we will always be good friends." I said sincerely.</p>
<p>At a vast crossroads, we parted ways.</p>
<p>I walked towards home. Looking at a dark darkness in front of me, a few yellow fires glowed, - the city's air defense night!</p>
<p>"The city is like this, but what about the countryside?" I muttered to myself, and a sense of loneliness as a wandering wanderer rose in my heart.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>— Wave</p>
<p>Let me work every day,</p>
<p>In the fields and forests, beside the table and machine,</p>
<p>In the noisy market, the quiet room;</p>
<p>If wandering fantasy makes me confused,</p>
<p>Let me say in my heart,</p>
<p>"This is my work; my happiness, not my misfortune;</p>
<p>Among human beings, I am also one</p>
<p>Can do the work accurately."</p>
<p>〇〇〇〇</p>
<p>Then I will be the price of my work,</p>
<p>Suitable for my spirit and proving my ability;</p>
<p>So I will gladly bless the time of work,</p>
<p>When the shadow appears in the dusk, I will play, love, and rest because I know that work is most beneficial to me. ——Patent Vanderke</p>
<h3>Zuan Zuan</h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>In my consulting room, I often hear the cries, screams, and noises of sick children, which make my heart restless and feel very annoyed, so I don't have much affection for children.</p>
<p>It was the season when cassia blossoms were fragrant last year that my eldest daughter - Zuan Zuan was born. She cries and screams like other children, but I don't feel annoyed or resentful at all. On the contrary, I compare her cries and screams to pleasant jazz songs, and I also try my best to coax her in various ways, and sometimes I even pretend to be a dog or a cat. I have such good patience with Zuan Zuan, but it is different from my attitude towards other children.</p>
<p>Since I was a child, my　appearance has been very bad, and it is common for me to drop the quilt under the bed. Because I love her so much, I often like to hug her and fall asleep together, but I have never dropped her or hurt her. Sometimes when one of my hands is about to press on her body, I will wake up very sensitively.</p>
<p>I have forgotten or even rejected the instructions of my parents and the entrustments of my friends, but I don't ask about Zuan Zuan. I once ran all over Xingsheng Street to buy a pound of red wool, and as a result, I still had to ask a friend to find it on the black market at a high price. To buy a rubber nipple, I also asked more than a dozen pharmacies and walked through the department store. In the display window, I paid special attention to children's products. Once, I saw a red children's dress, the style was very novel and beautiful, but it was for six or seven-year-old children to wear, and Zuan Zuan would have to wait four or five years to wear it, and I would actually buy it. I sincerely want to serve Zuan Zuan, and I don't want any reward. I just hope she grows up, is healthy, beautiful, and lively.</p>
<p>However, things do not always go as one wishes. On May 17, Zuan Zuan left me. She was only suffering from pinkeye when she was sick. I only gave her a little treatment and didn't care much about it. The condition deteriorated rapidly in one or two days, which caught me off guard and I couldn't treat it. Watching her breathe her last breath, I cried, I regretted, my heart was shattered into pieces. I am a doctor who is in charge of life, but I cannot save my beloved baby. I doubt my medical skills, and I think I will not practice medicine in the future, but I know that this is too negative. I am still young, I must do more actively, I must study my medical skills carefully, save the dying sick children, and not create pain for their parents, which can also be used to comfort my heart that has been wounded.</p>
<p>The sick children in the consulting room, relying on the same cries, screams, now, my heart does not feel annoyed and restless at all. On the contrary, I feel very relaxed and very patient with my diagnosis.</p>
<p>"Love my own child and extend it to other people's children" is indeed an unalterable scripture. You really have to have your own children to know how to love other people's children!</p>

<h3>Sports The Vigor of Mini-Football</h3>
<p>This summer, tennis and swimming, which are suitable for the season, are extremely deserted, while mini-football, which is usually not noticed by fans, is unexpectedly vigorous. This is because tennis is too expensive, and swimming is limited by the lack of swimming pools, which has hindered its rapid development. Mini-football, on the other hand, is easy to play, leading to a shift from the former to the latter. There are six or seven mini-football cup competitions being held, and the number of teams participating in each cup exceeds expectations, making it a popular event and adding to the summer scenery of Shanghai's sports scene.</p>
<h3>Today's Showdown of the Top Four</h3>
<p>The inaugural Mini-Football League, organized by the Shanghai Mini-Football Association, has been progressing smoothly since its opening on the 8th of last month, thanks to the enthusiastic service of Tan Xi, Shen Chun, Deng Xiaoliang, and Huang Renyi, and has now reached the final stage. The final matches of each group will begin today, with two championship matches in the A group featuring the top teams in mini-football, promising to be a sensation.</p>
<p>The reporter will analyze and predict the strengths of the four A-group teams. To maintain order today, and because the Mini-Football Association is not selling tickets for this competition and is using the Youth Friendship Association's venue for free, a fee will now be charged. However, after each competition, there has been a lot of damage. Therefore, tickets will be sold for 50 yuan and 100 yuan to compensate the association for the cost of repairing the field. First, the order of today's A-group final matches is as follows:</p>
<p>Friendship Association vs. Whirlwind (A-Group Part 1 Final) 5:00 PM</p>
<p>Huatong vs. Hequn (A-Group Overall Final) 6:00 PM</p>
<h3>Friendship Association's Players are Experienced</h3>
<p>Friendship Association and Whirlwind have the same score in the first division, so they will compete today for the top spot. The two teams have met once before, with Whirlwind defeating Friendship Association. However, after unfortunately losing to the French Concession, a rematch was set. The Friendship Association will seize this chance for revenge. Looking at the strength of the two teams, Friendship Association is similar to the style of football, making use of their robust physique to perform boldly. The team includes first-class players such as Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, and Xu Wenkui, all of whom are well-known to Shanghai fans. Furthermore, defenders Yan Shican and Feng Jian have returned from Hong Kong. Therefore, the team is impeccable. Whirlwind is extremely active in the mini-football scene and performs very skillfully recently, being light, delicate, and seamless, which is wonderful. In particular, Luo Shoufu and Mai Ersen make use of their agility to dodge and weave, and their attention to detail is noteworthy. Therefore, in terms of performance, Whirlwind is more enjoyable to watch than Friendship Association. However, the outcome of the match requires the impetus of all aspects, and the Friendship Association's players have rich experience and are resourceful in battle. As they will be seeking revenge this time, they will surely work together to achieve victory. Therefore, the outcome of today's match is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Huatong and Hequn are Evenly Matched</h3>
<p>Huatong is the champion of the second division of Group A, and Hequn is the leader of the third division. This year, Huatong has been enthusiastic about mini-football and has achieved good results. They specifically invited Fa Fanxiao as their coach to provide guidance. As a result, the team has made significant progress, and the team's cooperation is seamless. The players have also made remarkable improvements in their skills. Zhou Qilin and Meng Yiliang have regained their full vigor, which is encouraging. Hequn's players are all outstanding talents from the football training class established by Dai Linjing. This time, Ah Dai has personally led his students, and Dong Jincai, a mini-football goalkeeper from Jiaxing, has joined the team, adding to their strength. Their operational factors are passed down from one team, so there are few loopholes. Knowing the enemy and knowing yourself will bring good skills. They are evenly matched with Huatong and will definitely have a brilliant and exciting performance.</p>
<p>In summary, today's two major battles will feature mini-football masters who are also famous in the football scene. Mini-football has its own unique appeal. All fans, come and join us! Furthermore, the Youth Friendship Association's football field has a beautiful environment, so it is also possible to take a few friends as a holiday park for recreation.</p>
<h3>Today's Softball Tournament Panda vs. Portuguese Team Victory for Overseas Filipinos with a Hit from Liang Yousheng</h3>
<p>The softball league, which was dominated by Westerners, has seen the Chinese team Pandas win every game since they joined this summer. In last Sunday's game against the Overseas Filipinos (F.M.U. Knights), the Pandas displayed their power to the fullest. After an extremely tense and hard-fought game, Liang Yousheng's hit gave them a one-point victory over the Overseas Filipinos. Thousands of fans at the scene cheered and jumped with joy. As such, the Pandas' hopes of winning the championship have become increasingly strong.</p>
<h3>Today</h3>
<p>(27th) Pandas will play against Lusitano Reds today. Lusitano Reds were the champions of the previous season, and they will fight to the death to determine the winner. At the same time, our Chinese team will also do its best to compete and prepare rigorously in order to win glory for the Chinese and seize the championship. Fans can go to Jiaozhou Park (free admission) at 9:45 AM to watch the game. At the same time, they can cheer for our Chinese team.</p>
<h3>Pandas</h3>
<p>The most important thing to note about today's game is that the Portuguese team will use short bunts to get on base. Because they already know that the Chinese team's outfield cannot be easily fooled. In the game against the Overseas Filipinos, the Chinese team only won by a score of 2-1. It can be seen that both sides had done their best to defend. In particular, the Pandas' outfielders were all very agile. The Filipino team had powerful hits from Basha, Taishan, and Tang Qiaosi. The most dangerous moments were in the fourth and seventh innings. In the fourth inning, the Chinese team's outfielders connected to the Filipino team's high balls twice. One was a brilliant catch by Tang Weiye, and the other was a tricky ball hit by Basha and caught by Lao Zhaosen. Also, in the seventh inning, when the Chinese team was leading by one point, Tang Qiaosi came up to bat, and another outfield ball was carefully caught by Tang Weiye. Otherwise, it would have been a home run, and the game would have been tied. Therefore, one way to deal with the Portuguese team's short bunts today is that if the Portuguese team's short bunt is along the first base line, the pitcher can pretend to chase the ball and walk in front of the runner, while the first baseman can rush forward to grab the ball and throw it to first base, and the second baseman can fill the space and catch it. In this way, the ball will definitely arrive at the base first. Because the runner will panic and slow down after the pitcher walks in front of him. (The pitcher does not commit a foul by walking in front of the runner, as long as he does not bump into him or deliberately obstruct him, so it is not blocking.) At the same time, the first baseman can throw to first base with ease. The Chinese team may wish to adopt this method to restrain the Portuguese team. At the same time, in the game against the Overseas Filipinos, the catcher Wang Qingrui lacked calmness. For example, in the fifth inning, he mistakenly threw to second base, allowing the Filipino player on third base to take the opportunity to return to the base, which was caused by panic. Today, the opposing team is good at running the bases, so it is important to be cautious. In addition, only Lu Zhaosen, Liang Yousheng, Wang Xiushan, and Wen Ruixiong are slightly better at hitting the ball. In last week's game, Fu Jun's two brilliant hits and Liang Yousheng's clever short bunt in the fourth inning brought Lu Zhaosen and Wang Qingrui (mistakenly written as Huang Yingrui) back from second and third base, which was particularly commendable. However, Wen Ruixiong seems to be declining recently, and he missed two hit balls in last week's game. On the other hand, first baseman Wang Nianzu seems to be improving, and he is not as slow and messy as before.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sports Association Tennis Tournament Cai Guoji Defeats H. Kelasha</h3>
<p>The handicap tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Sports Association (formerly the Racecourse) opened in July. Because it is a friendly tournament for members, very few outsiders know about it. Recently (25th), there was a tense singles match, and I was happy to go and watch it at the invitation of Qu Zhaohong. The players were Cai Guoji, a rising star of the Chinese team, and H. Kelasha, a veteran. Because the two players belong to the same A-level, there was no handicap. Kelasha is known as a "sticky rubber," capable of both attacking and defending, and has rich experience, while Cai has been improving rapidly recently and has skills in both long rallies and net play. Although Kelasha was cunning, he was defeated, which is gratifying. It can be considered a small addition to the otherwise newsless summer tennis season. Attached is Cai's score against Ke. (Jie) Cai Guoji 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 H. Kelasha</p>
