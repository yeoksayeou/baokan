<h3>日本大本營昨發表神風攻擊隊戰果　沉毀敵空母戰艦巡艦等廿七艘</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日本大本營十月三十一日下午四時三十分發表：（一）神風特別攻擊機隊，自十月二十五日以來，即連續猛攻菲律賓東方海面（包括雷伊泰灣）之敵機動部隊及運輸船團，該隊所收戰果，現已確認者如次：炸沉敵航空母艦三艘，巡洋艦一艘，運輸船一艘，炸毁敵航空母艦六艘，戰艦兩艘，巡洋艦兩艘，運輸船一艘，又艦型不明者三艘。（二）據其後之報吿，應追加前所發表（菲律賓海面海戰）之戰果如次：炸沉敵巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦兩艘，炸毁敵航空母艦兩艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘。</p>
<p>菲律賓某基地三十一日中央社電　日軍神風特別攻擊隊，二十九日正午於拉孟灣東方海面，圍攻空母四艘（其中三艘爲大型艦），戰艦二艘乃至四艘及其他艦船十餘艘組成之敵有力機動部隊，確見敵大型空母艦後方中彈起火，即行擱淺，神風隊後繼機投彈，亦命中艦型不詳之艦船二艘，巡洋艦一艘，均使之中彈起火。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍某基地三十一日中央社電　日軍神風特別攻擊隊，二十七日下午六時許猛襲雷伊泰灣，對停泊之敵艦船作壯烈之拼撞攻擊，第一機撞中敵戰艦後部，使受重創，第二機撞中敵巡洋艦，使受重創，第三機於突擊中，不幸中彈，但仍不屈，猛然撞入敵大型運輸船船尾。</p>
<p>中央社訊　盟邦日本在滬海軍軍事專家，昨發表談話云：「三十一日午後四時三十分，大本營發表之日本神風特別攻擊機隊神勇果敢之戰果，吾人對之深感振奮。此次神風特別攻擊機隊所獲戰果，計擊沉敵航空母艦九艘，其他戰艦等計十九艘，羅斯福總統對大總統選舉想出種種手段，藉期實現，但結果適得其反。其兵艦均被擊沉，在雷伊泰灣裏尚有少數敵方小艇，但此數敵艇不久必將被日本擊滅，尤其吾人必須明瞭者，日本神風特別攻擊機隊之隊員，平均在二十至二十三歲之　，他們在中學尚未畢業，卽參加航空隊，經過許多猛烈訓練，他們的思想與信念，除了擊滅敵方英美外，別無他想。從前許多人均謂，如果此輩青少年能參加前方作戰，戰局必爲之一變，現大東亞戰爭中已實現此語。此輩青年平時生活甚爲明朗而天眞，他們只知向著目標前進，但他們對故鄉父母亦時常懷念，此即所謂忠孝雙全的青年，從前吾人可以想像，特別攻擊機隊必有非常優秀之機械，因爲任何勇敢，欲以一機而擊沉敵方一切，實至困難，由此可以想到特別攻擊機隊必有良好機會。吾人現在等着敵方總反攻與決戰，吾人年年有着五十萬勇敢的青年，即使敵方將小型機艇全部出擊，吾人必有最後準備，所以敵方所宣傳之戰後經營之謀略，吾人已完全予以打破無遺」。</p>
<h3>日魚雷突擊隊重創敵船團　培島繼續激戰</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地三十一日中央社電　日軍某魚雷艇隊所屬之魚雷艇挺身隊十餘艘，由平井明海軍上尉率領，曾乘雨天暗夜，由帛琉本島奇襲培里琉東方海面之敵運輸船團，此外，與此呼應之遠藤谷司海軍中佐領率之突擊隊，乘舟艇突入培里琉島北岸，各予敵軍以重創。</p>
<h3>菲律賓海面　日海軍綜合戰果</h3>
<p>東京卅一日中央社電　十月二十四日至二十六日間，日軍於菲律賓海面戰所獲戰果中，其後更追加發表擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦二艘，擊毁空母二艘，驅逐艦三艘，今將菲律賓海面海戰　後發表之戰果綜合如次：計擊沉敵空母八艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦四艘，運輸船四艘以上。擊落敵機約五百架，擊毁敵空母九艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘，巡洋艦或驅逐艦三艘。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>南通丸慘案</h3>
<p>自去年十二月九日，中華輪船公司之華泰輪在新港江面失事以來，甫十閱月，而上月二十三日又以該公司之南通丸，於滸浦附近發生慘案聞。此次案情之輕重，據本報所揭露，正與上次華泰輪事件相埒，至於肇事之原因，或仍不外乎「單幫」擁擠載重過度，前後情形如出一轍。本市航政局方面正在調查肇事眞相（參閱本報上月二十八日本埠新聞欄），尚未有所公布。而中華輪船公司副社長對中央社記者之談話（參閱本報上月二十七日本埠新聞欄），則謂「南通輪之失事，不僅爲公司之損失，並爲中日兩國之損失……公司方面於二十六晚派甲種預備員富第勇吉偕同救起船員等，馳赴出事地點勘察，從事打撈。」在航政局所調查之眞相以及該公司所勘察之報吿未披露以前，願先就一般情形加以　列。</p>
<p>（一）自實施物資統制以來，配給永不能上軌道，而物價永不能抑平，於是畸形之「單幫」階級，亦日益充斥。姑不論其在經濟界所發生之影響，僅就交通界所感受之秩序紊亂而言，已在鐵路輪船各方面均有顯著之現象，而中華輪船公司所發生之兩次慘案，均以「單幫」擁擠爲主因之一。故欲恢復交通秩序，必先使物資之交流暢利，而後求配給合理與物價穩定，則「單幫」當然絕跡。故對於目前交通量之失常以及慘案之連續發生，物資統制機關應負間接之責任。</p>
<p>（二）航政機關原爲督察航行，保障安全，推進航運而設，各船構造上機械上之檢騐，以及載重之限制，均爲航政局應有之責任。華泰輪失事之後，猶不知猛省懺悔，加强其本身職權之行使，不及一年，而災禍迭見。則主管航政人員漠視民命放棄職守，實無可諉卸其應得之罪愆。</p>
<p>（三）中華輪船公司爲直接管理輪船之機關，在華泰輪失事之後，應知所警惕，力加整頓，以防止類似之事態連續發生。不特計不出此，求未雨之綢繆，乃於南通丸慘案發生後之第三日，始派員勘察從事打撈，可見該公司平時旣無策安全之措施，臨時亦無救險之能力。該公司副社長所謂此不僅公司之損失，幷爲中日兩國之損失，可稱「慨乎言之」！華中鐵道旣不能予人以好評，而中華輪船又疏忽至如此地步。吾人對於中日合辦之公用事業，不能不引爲遺憾。</p>
<p>（四）凡不幸之事態旣已發生，無可追悔，惟有徹究責任，寧可殺一儆百而杜絕此後之禍源，斷不可敷衍門面更長玩忽之風氣。華泰輪失事之後未見責任問題之分曉，故不久有此次南通丸慘案之踵接。深盼航政局所謂「調查肇事眞相」以及中華輪船公司所謂「派員馳赴出事地點勘察」，不久有詳情公布，並以事實之根據而執行斷然之措施。若依然上下相蒙因循了事，則南通丸爲華泰之續，又不知何時何地孰爲南通丸之續也！</p>
<p>月暈而風礎潤而雨，官廳放棄職守而機關不顧責任，則輪船不幸之事件，亦事理之固然，願有關方面，知履霜堅冰之戒，其各凜諸！</p>
<h3>中日締約週年　汪主席訓詞　光明在望努力前進</h3>
<p>中日和平奠定基石</p>
<p>中日同盟條約的意義，在去年今日締結的當時，早已明白的指出。那時候我曾經說過：「中國和日本發生國家間和民族間的關係，已經二千多年了，但是像這般完全根據於東方道義精神，來規定兩國友好關係的條約，還是第一次」。（中略）我幷且說過，「此次修正條約的決意，是由日本政府提出，乃至此次同盟條約及附屬談定　換文的底稿，也是由日本政府提出，將上次訂約時日本方面所得的特權，加以拋棄，毫沒有一點保留。同時對於中國方面所憂慮的各點，澈底的予以　除。」這完全出於日本政府及國民的好意，爲中日兩國永久友好起見，爲大東亞共榮起見，本於道義的精神，同胞的情感，提出這樣光明正大主張，給予中國以起死回生的援助力量，爲中日兩國奠下了永久友好的基石，爲東亞開闢了合於正義之和平的大路。</p>
<p>兩國安危互相關聯</p>
<p>約而言之，中日兩國經過數十年的糾紛，終於演出不幸的事變，也終在不幸的事變之血的教訓中，使中日兩國互相認識互相了解。過去因爲未能把這些糾紛的原因認識了解，所以怨恨愈積愈深，幾年來的戰事，才使中國知道決不能打敗日本，也不該撇棄日本，而以爲可以自存。日本也覺悟了決不能滅亡中國，也不該漠視中國，而以爲可以獨隆。並且使中日兩國都知道，這些糾紛是英美侵略主義者縱橫捭闔的結果，同時又是英美侵略主義者挑撥離間的間隙，這正合國父在中國存亡問題中所提示的遺訓，「日本與中國之關係，實爲存亡安危兩國相關聯者，無日本即無中國，無中國亦無日本。爲謀兩國百年之安，必不可於其間稍致芥蒂。」現在想來，國父的先知先覺，早已把中日的情形洞燭無遺了。</p>
<p>國府還都以後，首先和日本訂立中日基本關係條約，以爲中日和平的第一度橋頭。到了大東亞戰爭爆發之後，中國又毅然參戰，以同生共死之決心，分擔保衛東亞的重任。中日兩國之間的認識和了解，因此乃愈趨於明朗透澈之途。及至日本以最大的誠意和協力，贊助中國收回租界，撤廢治外法權，循此以至於去年今日的重新結盟訂約，即中日同盟條約，於是往日爲糾紛起因的一切誤解和隔閡，摧陷廓清，無復存在。（中略）</p>
<p>把握時機淬礪奮發</p>
<p>在總力決戰的現在中國的存亡，以致於東亞的存亡，責任正負担在我們的肩上。我們應該知道同盟條約之締結，不是容易得來的，同盟條約之完全實現，也不是僥倖可成的。過去要經過無數的努力，現在還要經過誠意的實踐的努力。國父說道：「盡文明國應盡之義務，以期享文明國應享之權利。」同盟條約之締結，是盟邦以文明國待我，我們也就應該以文明國自處。並且應該盡文明國所應盡之義務，我們今日惟有根據同盟條約，一方面努力分担同盟作戰之義務，一方面努力促進和平統一之實現。這（中略）</p>
<p>自從同盟條約締結之後，我個人不久便病倒，對於同盟條約締結後之發展，未能爲進一步之努力。對於大東亞戰爭之完遂，未能爲更積極之貢獻，實深內疚。然而我確信中日同盟條約，是中日兩國永久友好之基石，大東亞戰爭之完遂，是東亞各國家民族自存與共存之唯一條件。我唯有祝禱全國同胞，把握時機，淬礪齊發，盟邦朝野正在上下一心，誓死奮鬥，也正期待着我們的協力，我們不能不拿出我們的熱誠和力量來，和我們生死與共的盟友，共同奮鬥。同胞們，光明正在我們的前面，我們前進！前進！（續完）</p>

<h3>日軍在菲島前綫奮勇予敵以重創　基地停留敵機損毀殆盡</h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　雷伊泰島之陸戰依然劇烈，未能樂觀，現雷伊泰灣內美運輪船二十八日增加約達五十餘艘，巡洋艦，驅逐艦十數艘，二十六日，美軍已開始使用塔克羅班及塔拉克兩地之飛機塲，運來飛機多架，掩護作戰，其基地兵力二十七日於塔克羅班南方地區復有一師登陸，是故該地區敵軍已有二師，合計塔拉克之兩師，已達四師，熾烈反攻，日守軍對比優勢敵軍奮勇應戰，阻止其前進，同時日空軍盡夜活躍，連襲敵機塲，粉碎敵使用機塲之企圖。二十八日夜，急襲塔拉克機塲，焚燬其設施二所，炸毀滑走路，並襲塔克羅班機塲，炸毀其各種設施。二十九日再襲塔拉克機塲，毀壞其滑走路，其他一隊日機空襲塔克羅班機塲傍設施二所，中彈起火。關於美機來襲狀况，廿四·五兩日雖見激減，廿七日後又增多，二十八日較少，二十九日又以艦戰機累計二百五六十架三度來襲馬尼刺，克拉克地區，經日軍　擊，擊落其二十七架，該邀擊戰中，日機亦有若干機未返，然陸上可謂毫無損害，綜觀雷伊泰島之決戰，已日見熾烈，今後雷伊泰島及雷伊泰灣之日美航空決戰，將決定兩軍之戰勢，故其雷趨若何，惟賴日方空軍勢力之補給如何。</p>
<p>馬尼刺三十一日中央社電　雷伊泰島方面敵軍及其海上空母勢力，遭日軍多方痛擊，數量激減。敵爲加强該地實力，後由新幾內亞及夏威夷方面向菲律賓增送飛機多架，且急於利用雷伊泰島之航空基地，二十五日開始使用塔克羅班及塔拉克兩機塲，二十六日集中飛機約達七十架，然遭日軍空襲，損毀殆盡，現復從事增補工作。據日方偵察機報吿，二十八日下午，塔拉克機塲停有飛機數十架，上空且有七架哨戒，而二十九日上午九時，僅停有十架，一架巡戒，較日前減少甚多，悉係爲日機炸毀。此外敵美復修理桑巴布羅機塲，但因受日機空襲，均不能充分利用。</p>
<p>馬尼刺三十一日中央社電　日陸軍機隊二十三日曾三次猛攻雷伊泰灣內敵艦船　，已獲偉大戰果，於此次攻擊中，除於日前發表之戰果外，更證實擊沉水上機母艦一艘。</p>
<p>馬尼刺三十一日中央社電　於雷伊泰島登陸之敵軍，曾由海上封鎖雷伊泰島，企圖阻止日軍之援軍，夜間更使快速艇活躍於雷伊泰灣，至雷伊泰島西方卡麥泰海及相接薩馬島之聖法尼克海峽等地</p>

<h3>土井水　必須煮沸飲用　房主疫症發生保障健康</h3>

<h3>今日的天津</h3>
<p>— 武公</p>
<p>大津是華北首屈一指的國際都市，以前原有許多國的租界：如日本，英國，法國，義國，德國，奧國，俄國及比國等八國的租界。可是自從本年接收義租界以後，此等不同的租界已究全消減。這樣市政一元的好現象，是我此次來津後哈一的印象。</p>
<p>租界接收後氣象一新</p>
<p>據張市長說，除俄奧德比等四國租界在事變前交還我國外，其它如英租界則於大東亞戰爭發生時先山則邦極部隊斷然施以軍事的接收，故當初名爲　區，迨後盟邦爲尊重我國主權起見，乃於民國三十一年二月十八日正式移交我國，成立特別行政區。等到日本租界隨我國於去年一月九日對英美宜戰而交還的，遂與上述特別行政區同時以爲興亞第一區與第二區。後來法租界也相繼交還，乃又設與亞第三區。前後在義大利租界交還之後，又另設一特管區。此項行政區域之劃分，原爲一時權宜之計，迎當初原有十二區在內，　個天津市却一共分做十六個區。直到本年四月一日，乃另行劃定市區，今日已僅區別爲八個區，且將原有路名完全修改，大概前法租界都稱做中經，中緯和西開幾號路；前義租界都稱做河東幾號路；前奧國租界都稱做金湯幾號路；前英國租界都稱做南經或南緯幾號路。至於警局則分爲十二分局，除第一區，第六區，第八區及第七區都設兩個分局外，餘則每區都設一個分局。此外如工務處，稅務稽徵所與衛生事務所，都是按照各區分別設立分所。</p>
<p>市政的一元化</p>
<p>天津市政的如此走上一元化的軌道，這當然不能不推到盟邦協助之功。尤其在各儸租界交還乏後，除法租界原有人員以條約關係尚有留職者外，其他一槪去職。故今日的天津市可說完全是一個獨立自主的我國都市，我們是十二分寄以期待的。尤其這種情形很值得我們從上海來的人做參考，因爲在今日的天津市府或警察局，簡直沒有一個外籍的官吏。盟邦方面除在市府有顧問一人，顧問輔佐官四人（人駐警局，一人駐財政局，餘二人則分駐其它各局），及在各局有專員一人至二人外，簡直毫不干涉我國的市政。所調專員，只是聯絡員的性質，而顧問的確也只有諮詢的作用吧了！</p>
<p>天津市府的組織，在市長之下設有秘書與宣傳二處，社會·財政·警察·敎育·衛生與經濟等六局。至於各區，則設區長一人，助理二人，下分總務·宣導·編練與配給四組。所謂編練，即指編練警防團（保甲）而言。今日天津一般民衆的配給，據張市長對記者言，可以每月每人配給麥粉或雜糧二十斤爲理想。主要物資如小麥等物，在每年收買時則絕對禁止私自買賣，在收買期過後則可自由買賣。</p>
<p>教育落後與生活高漲</p>
<p>在敎育方面，津市顯然沒有北京那麼發達。今日他們的市立小學還只有一百另四校，而私立的却有一百五十三校。市立中學共男子子三校女子二校，市立職業學校二所，市立師範一所，私立中學二十二所，私立職校三處與私立中學二十二處。大學祇有一處天主敎所辦的工商學院，當然在一百八十萬的天津人口中，這個數目是極小的。據張市長說，他們現正在與中樞商計設立大學一所。</p>
<p>受着晋遍物價高昻的影響，天津的生活指數亦按月上昇，若與北京相比或更爲昻貴。不過在這裏坐三輪或人力車則較北京爲便宜，而且你也不用講價，到目的地時任你給錢，車夫絕不會和你爭吵，這倒是一件比較痛快的事。但是這裏的一班公務員生活還是十二分的可憐，普通總只有二千元左右，常然在這個年頭是着實該受苦的吧！</p>

        <h1>1944.11.01</h1>
<h3>The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Yesterday the War Results of the Kamikaze Attack Squad: Sunk and Destroyed 27 Enemy Aircraft Carriers, Battleships, Cruisers, Etc.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on October 31st: (1) Since October 25th, the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron has continuously and fiercely attacked the enemy mobile units and transport convoys in the eastern waters of the Philippines (including Leyte Gulf). The confirmed war results of the squadron are as follows: Sunk 3 enemy aircraft carriers, 1 cruiser, 1 transport ship; Destroyed 6 enemy aircraft carriers, 2 battleships, 2 cruisers, 1 transport ship, and 3 ships of unknown type. (2) According to subsequent reports, the war results previously announced (the naval battle in the Philippine Sea) should be supplemented as follows: Sunk 1 enemy cruiser, 2 destroyers; Destroyed 2 enemy aircraft carriers, 3 cruisers or destroyers.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 31st (Central News Agency) – At noon on the 29th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron attacked a powerful enemy mobile unit consisting of 4 aircraft carriers (3 of which were large ships), 2 to 4 battleships, and more than 10 other ships in the eastern waters of Lamon Bay. It was confirmed that a large enemy aircraft carrier was hit and caught fire in the rear and ran aground. Subsequent Kamikaze aircraft dropped bombs, also hitting 2 ships of unknown type and 1 cruiser, all of which caught fire.</p>
<p>Japanese Base in the Philippines, 31st (Central News Agency) – At around 6:00 PM on the 27th, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron fiercely attacked Leyte Gulf, launching a heroic collision attack on the docked enemy ships. The first aircraft hit the rear of an enemy battleship, causing heavy damage. The second aircraft hit an enemy cruiser, causing heavy damage. The third aircraft was unfortunately hit by enemy fire during the attack, but it continued undeterred and crashed into the stern of a large enemy transport ship.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch – Allied Japanese naval military experts in Shanghai stated in a talk yesterday: "We are deeply encouraged by the brave and decisive war results of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron announced by the Imperial Headquarters at 4:30 PM on the 31st. The war results achieved by the Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron this time include sinking 9 enemy aircraft carriers and 19 other battleships, etc. President Roosevelt devised various means to achieve his presidential election, but the results were just the opposite. His warships were all sunk. There are still a few enemy small boats in Leyte Gulf, but these enemy boats will soon be annihilated by Japan. In particular, we must understand that the average age of the members of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Squadron is between 20 and 23. They joined the air force before graduating from middle school and underwent many intense trainings. Their thoughts and beliefs are solely focused on destroying the enemy British and Americans. In the past, many people said that if these young people could participate in frontline operations, the war situation would definitely change. This has now been realized in the Greater East Asia War. These young people have a very bright and innocent life in peacetime. They only know how to move forward towards their goals, but they also often miss their parents at home. This is what is called young people who are both loyal and filial. In the past, we could imagine that the Special Attack Squadron must have very excellent machinery, because it is really difficult to sink everything of the enemy with one aircraft, no matter how brave one is. From this, we can imagine that the Special Attack Squadron must have good opportunities. We are now waiting for the enemy's general counter-attack and decisive battle. We have 500,000 brave young people every year. Even if the enemy launches all small aircraft and boats, we must have the final preparation, so the enemy's post-war management strategies have been completely defeated by us."</p>
<h3>Japanese Torpedo Attack Squadron Heavily Damaged Enemy Convoy; Fierce Fighting Continues on Peleliu Island</h3>
<p>Japanese Base in the Central Pacific, 31st (Central News Agency) – More than ten torpedo boats belonging to a certain Japanese torpedo boat squadron, led by Navy Captain Akira Hirai, took advantage of a rainy and dark night to launch a surprise attack on the enemy transport convoy in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island from Palau Island. In addition, an attack squadron led by Navy Lieutenant Commander Taniyasu Endo, responding to this, broke into the northern coast of Peleliu Island by boat, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive War Results of the Japanese Navy in the Philippine Sea</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – Among the war results achieved by the Japanese forces in the Philippine Sea battles from October 24th to 26th, it has been further announced that one enemy cruiser and two destroyers were sunk, and two aircraft carriers and three destroyers were destroyed. Now, the war results announced after the naval battle in the Philippine Sea are summarized as follows: A total of 8 enemy aircraft carriers, 4 cruisers, 4 destroyers, and more than 4 transport ships were sunk. Approximately 500 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 9 enemy aircraft carriers, 1 battleship, 2 cruisers, and 3 cruisers or destroyers were destroyed.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Nantong Maru Tragedy</h3>
<p>It has only been ten months since the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Huatai Wheel was wrecked in the Xin'gang River on December 9th of last year, and now, on the 23rd of last month, the company's Nantong Maru suffered a tragedy near Hupu. According to what this newspaper has revealed, the severity of this incident is equal to the Huatai Wheel incident last time. As for the cause of the accident, it is probably still nothing more than the "single gangs" crowding and overloading the ship, the situation before and after being exactly the same. The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau is investigating the truth of the accident (see this newspaper's local news column on the 28th of last month) and has not yet announced anything. However, the vice president of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stated to a Central News Agency reporter (see this newspaper's local news column on the 27th of last month) that "The loss of the Nantong Wheel is not only a loss to the company but also a loss to both China and Japan... The company dispatched A-class reserve officer Tomi Daiyuki on the evening of the 26th, along with rescued crew members, to the scene of the accident to investigate and salvage." Before the truth investigated by the Navigation Administration Bureau and the report investigated by the company are disclosed, we would like to make a general statement first.</p>
<p>(1) Since the implementation of material control, distribution has never been on track, and prices have never been suppressed. As a result, the deformed "single gang" class is also becoming increasingly prevalent. Regardless of its impact on the economy, just looking at the disruption of order in the transportation sector, there are already significant phenomena in railways and ships. The two tragedies that have occurred at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company are mainly due to the crowding of "single gangs." Therefore, to restore transportation order, we must first facilitate the exchange of materials, and then seek reasonable distribution and stable prices. Then, the "single gangs" will naturally disappear. Therefore, the material control authorities should bear indirect responsibility for the current abnormality in traffic volume and the continuous occurrence of tragedies.</p>
<p>(2) The navigation administration agencies were originally established to supervise navigation, ensure safety, and promote shipping. The inspection of the structure and machinery of each ship, as well as the restriction of cargo weight, are all the responsibilities of the Navigation Administration Bureau. After the Huatai Wheel accident, it still did not know how to reflect and repent, strengthen the exercise of its own powers, and in less than a year, disasters occurred repeatedly. Therefore, the personnel in charge of navigation administration ignored the lives of the people and abandoned their duties, and there is no way to shirk their deserved guilt.</p>
<p>(3) The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the agency that directly manages the ships. After the Huatai Wheel accident, it should have been vigilant and strengthened rectification to prevent similar incidents from happening continuously. Not only did it not plan for this, but it did not plan for rainy days. It was only on the third day after the Nantong Maru tragedy that it sent personnel to investigate and salvage. It can be seen that the company usually has no safe measures, and it has no ability to save in an emergency. The vice president of the company said that this is not only a loss to the company but also a loss to both China and Japan, which can be called "generous words"! The China Railway Corporation cannot give people a good review, and China Merchants Steam Navigation is so negligent. We cannot help but feel sorry for the public utilities jointly run by China and Japan.</p>
<p>(4) After an unfortunate incident has occurred, there is no way to regret it. However, we must thoroughly investigate the responsibility, rather kill one to warn a hundred to prevent future disasters, and we must never perfunctorily and indulge the atmosphere of negligence. After the Huatai Wheel accident, the issue of responsibility was not clarified, so soon after, the Nantong Maru tragedy followed. We deeply hope that the so-called "investigation of the truth of the accident" by the Navigation Administration Bureau and the so-called "dispatch of personnel to the scene of the accident for investigation" by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will soon have details announced, and decisive measures will be implemented based on the facts. If they still deceive each other up and down and act perfunctorily, then the Nantong Maru is a continuation of the Huatai, and we do not know when and where who will be the continuation of the Nantong Maru!</p>
<p>When the moon is encircled by a halo, there will be wind; when the plinth is damp, there will be rain. If the government abandons its duties and the agencies do not take responsibility, then the unfortunate events of ships are also the inevitable result of things. We hope that the relevant parties will know the warning of treading on frost and ice, and be careful!</p>
<h3>The First Anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Treaty; Chairman Wang's Address; Hope is in Sight, Strive Forward</h3>
<p>The Cornerstone of Sino-Japanese Peace</p>
<p>The significance of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was clearly pointed out at the time of its conclusion last year today. At that time, I once said: "China and Japan have had national and ethnic relations for more than two thousand years, but this is the first time that a treaty that completely based on the spirit of Eastern morality has been used to stipulate friendly relations between the two countries." (Omission) I also said, "The decision to revise the treaty was proposed by the Japanese government, and even the draft of the alliance treaty and the attached exchange of notes was proposed by the Japanese government, which abandoned the privileges obtained by the Japanese side during the last treaty and did not retain them at all. At the same time, all the points that China was worried about were thoroughly eliminated." This was entirely out of the good intentions of the Japanese government and people, for the sake of the permanent friendship between China and Japan, for the sake of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, based on the spirit of morality and the feelings of compatriots, to put forward such a bright and upright proposition, to give China the strength of resurrection assistance, to lay the cornerstone of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and to open up a road to peace that conforms to justice for East Asia.</p>
<p>The Security of the Two Countries is Interrelated</p>
<p>In short, after decades of disputes, China and Japan finally staged an unfortunate incident. It was also in the bloody lessons of the unfortunate incident that China and Japan came to know and understand each other. In the past, because the causes of these disputes could not be recognized and understood, resentment became increasingly deep. It was only the war in recent years that made China know that it could never defeat Japan, nor should it abandon Japan, and think that it could survive on its own. Japan also realized that it could never destroy China, nor should it ignore China, and think that it could flourish alone. Moreover, both China and Japan know that these disputes are the result of the manipulation of British and American imperialists, and at the same time, they are the gaps provoked by British and American imperialists. This is exactly in line with the late Father's legacy in the question of China's survival, "The relationship between Japan and China is related to the survival and security of the two countries. Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan. In order to seek the peace of the two countries for a hundred years, there must be no discord between them." Looking back now, the late Father's foresight had already seen the situation between China and Japan.</p>
<p>After the National Government returned to its capital, it first concluded the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty as the first bridgehead for Sino-Japanese peace. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China resolutely joined the war, sharing the heavy responsibility of defending East Asia with the determination to live and die together. The understanding and understanding between China and Japan has therefore become increasingly clear and thorough. As for Japan, with its greatest sincerity and cooperation, supporting China's recovery of concessions, abolition of extraterritoriality, and following this to the re-alliance and treaty signing last year today, that is, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, all the misunderstandings and estrangements that were the cause of past disputes were destroyed and cleared, and no longer exist. (Omission)</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity to Temper and Strive</p>
<p>In the current total war, China's survival, and even East Asia's survival, is the responsibility on our shoulders. We should know that the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty is not easy to come by, and the complete realization of the Alliance Treaty is not accidental. It took countless efforts in the past, and it still takes sincere and practical efforts now. The late Father said, "Fulfill the obligations that civilized countries should fulfill in order to enjoy the rights that civilized countries should enjoy." The conclusion of the Alliance Treaty is that the allies treat us as a civilized country, and we should also treat ourselves as a civilized country. Moreover, we should fulfill the obligations that civilized countries should fulfill. Today, we can only base on the Alliance Treaty, on the one hand, strive to share the obligations of the allied war, and on the other hand, strive to promote the realization of peaceful unification. This (Omission)</p>
<p>Since the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty, I personally fell ill soon after, and I have not been able to make further efforts for the development after the conclusion of the Alliance Treaty. I have not been able to make a more active contribution to the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and I feel deeply guilty. However, I am convinced that the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty is the cornerstone of permanent friendship between China and Japan, and the completion of the Greater East Asia War is the only condition for the self-preservation and co-existence of all countries and nations in East Asia. I can only pray that all compatriots in the country seize the opportunity, temper and strive together. The allies are united in their hearts and minds, vowing to fight to the death, and are also looking forward to our cooperation. We must take out our enthusiasm and strength to fight together with our allies who share life and death. Compatriots, the light is right in front of us, let us advance! Advance! (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Fought Bravely on the Front Lines in the Philippines, Inflicting Heavy Damage on the Enemy; Enemy Aircraft Remaining at the Base Were Almost Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The land battle on Leyte Island is still fierce and not optimistic. The number of American transport ships in Leyte Gulf has increased to about 50 on the 28th, with a dozen cruisers and destroyers. On the 26th, the American army has begun to use the airfields in Tacloban and Dulag to transport many aircraft to cover the operation. On the 27th, the enemy's base force landed with another division in the southern area of Tacloban. Therefore, the enemy army in the area has two divisions. Counting the two divisions in Dulag, it has reached four divisions, launching a fierce counter-attack. The Japanese garrison fought bravely against the superior enemy forces, preventing their advance. At the same time, the Japanese air force was active all night, continuously attacking enemy airfields, shattering the enemy's attempt to use the airfields. On the night of the 28th, they raided the Dulag airfield, burned down two of its facilities, and destroyed the runway. They also attacked the Tacloban airfield, destroying its various facilities. On the 29th, they attacked the Dulag airfield again, destroying its runway. Another team of Japanese aircraft bombed two facilities near the Tacloban airfield, which were hit and caught fire. Regarding the situation of American aircraft attacking, although it was drastically reduced on the 24th and 25th, it increased again after the 27th. There were fewer on the 28th, and on the 29th, a total of 250 to 260 carrier-based aircraft attacked Manila and Clark three times. After being intercepted by the Japanese army, 27 of them were shot down. In the interception battle, some Japanese aircraft also did not return, but the land can be said to be undamaged. Overall, the decisive battle on Leyte Island has become increasingly fierce. In the future, the Japanese-American air decisive battle on Leyte Island and Leyte Gulf will determine the war situation of the two armies. Therefore, its trend depends on how the Japanese air force's power is replenished.</p>
<p>Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces and their naval air carrier forces on Leyte Island have been severely attacked by the Japanese army and their numbers have been drastically reduced. In order to strengthen the strength of the area, the enemy sent many aircraft from New Guinea and Hawaii to the Philippines, and was eager to use the air bases on Leyte Island. On the 25th, they began to use the two airfields of Tacloban and Dulag. On the 26th, they concentrated about 70 aircraft, but they were attacked by the Japanese air force and almost completely destroyed. They are now engaged in replenishment work. According to reports from Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, in the afternoon of the 28th, there were dozens of aircraft parked at the Dulag airfield, and there were seven aircraft patrolling in the sky. However, at 9:00 AM on the 29th, there were only ten aircraft parked and one patrolling, which was much less than before, all of which were destroyed by Japanese aircraft bombing. In addition, the enemy is repairing the Sambaburo airfield, but it cannot be fully utilized due to the Japanese air attacks.</p>
<p>Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army air squadron launched three fierce attacks on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf on the 23rd, and achieved great results. In this attack, in addition to the war results announced a few days ago, it has been further confirmed that one seaplane tender was sunk.</p>
<p>Manila, 31st (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces landing on Leyte Island have blockaded Leyte Island from the sea in an attempt to prevent reinforcements from the Japanese army. At night, they made fast boats active in Leyte Gulf, the Camotes Sea west of Leyte Island, and the San Juanico Strait connecting Samar Island.</p>

The Japanese army that entered the southern boundary of the West River has all crossed the Yu River and continued to take a fan-shaped attack to inflict a major blow on a part of the 64th Army of the Chongqing side on the front line.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Front Line in South China, 31st (Central News Agency) – It is rumored that the Chongqing military authorities have now transferred a part of the tank team belonging to the Fifth Army Group stationed in Kunming to the Guangxi front line and deployed it in the southern areas of Liuzhou and Guilin for defense.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Are Preparing to Celebrate; Joint Declaration Commemorates; Expanded Publicity Will Be Held Continuously for Several Days</h3>
<p>The anniversary of the Greater East Asia Declaration falls on the 6th of this month. All sectors of the city will have grand celebrations to commemorate it. This important event in East Asian history. It is recently learned that the Shanghai Special City Corps of Chinese Youth and Teenagers and the Fourth Detachment of the Chinese Youth Model Corps will, since the 8th of this month is the anniversary of the Defense of East Asia and the 9th is the anniversary of Participation in the War, jointly organize the City Party Headquarters, the New Movement Branch, the Chinese Youth Branch School, and the Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, etc., to hold continuous expanded publicity for these several days. At that time, in addition to sending detachments to march through the streets of various districts of the city and to make ordinary publicity to various entertainment venues, a telegram will be issued by youths and teenagers throughout the city in order to promote the people to rise up together and work hard to practice the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>
<h3>Well Water Must Be Boiled Before Drinking; Landlords Prevent Epidemics to Protect Health</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the lack of fuel, the city's tap water company had no choice but to reduce the water pressure and limit its usage, which caused inconvenience to the general public, and they dug wells to draw water. The most appropriate method is to open a "deep well" and use a motor to pump up the water from hundreds of feet deep underground for application, but due to material and electricity relations, they generally use soil wells to make up for it. However, the depth of soil wells varies from ten feet to twenty feet, which is the underground water closest to the topsoil. That is, the moisture that gradually decreases from the well surface, so it contains solid impurities. This solid is heavier than water and is suspended by vibrations in the water. When the water is still, after a considerable time, the solid settles, and gradually clears. This is the phenomenon of turbidity and clarity that we see when we draw water. It is common to use alum or soda ash as a coagulant to make it precipitate, but the water after the impurities have settled looks clean, but in fact it contains a lot of E. coli and other microorganisms. If citizens use this well water as drinking water, then the danger is really avoidable. The city's health bureau protects the health of citizens and prevents the occurrence of epidemics. It once initially banned it, but had to temporarily allow it in order to take care of the environment, but do not use this water as drinking water. If you have to, you must thoroughly boil it. It is about personal health, and I hope citizens pay attention.</p>
<h3>Traffic Safety Campaign, Last Day Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Department's "Traffic Safety Week" organized by the Municipal Police Department is today the last day. The past results are fairly satisfactory. Director Lü Qi of the Administrative Office, accompanied by the Deputy Director and the Chief of the Traffic Section, inspected various locations the day before yesterday. Deficiencies at locations such as the intersection of Great Shanghai Road and Tibet Road have been rectified since yesterday. Today, attention will be paid to the general knowledge of drivers. The main points are as follows: (1) A moment's negligence can lead to immense disaster. (2) Instead of impatiently using the horn, it is better to drive humbly and slowly. (3) Do not smoke or chat with others while driving. (4) After an air raid alarm is issued, immediately turn off the lights and park the vehicle on the side of the road. (5) Regularly inspect the mechanical parts to ensure the brakes are in good condition. At night, check the vehicle lights' air defense equipment to ensure they meet the standards. Letting others pass is the greatest public service for a driver, while boasting is the only cause of accidents. (7) Remember "green light go, red light stop". Although the matter is simple, all accidents arise from carelessness and neglect. (8) Drivers must be agile in limbs, calm in mind, and have keen eyesight and hearing.</p>

<h3>Today's Tianjin</h3>
<p>--Wu Gong</p>
<p>Tianjin is the leading international city in North China. Previously, there were concessions of many countries: such as Japan, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Austria, Russia, and Belgium. However, since the takeover of the Italian concession this year, these different concessions have been completely eliminated. This good phenomenon of municipal unity is the one impression I have after coming to Tianjin this time.</p>
<p>A Fresh Start After the Concession Takeover</p>
<p>According to Mayor Zhang, except for the concessions of Russia, Austria, Germany, and Belgium, which were returned to our country before the incident, others, such as the British concession, were decisively taken over militarily by the troops of Commander-in-Chief Yamaoka when the Greater East Asia War broke out. Therefore, it was initially called the Special District. Later, in order to respect our country's sovereignty, the Allied Powers officially transferred it to our country on February 18, 1942, and established a special administrative region. When the Japanese concession was returned following our country's declaration of war against Britain and the United States on January 9 last year, it became the Xingya First District and Second District together with the above-mentioned special administrative region. Later, the French concession was also successively returned, and the Yaxia Third District was set up. Before and after the return of the Italian concession, another special management district was set up. This division of administrative regions was originally a temporary expedient. Including the original twelve districts, Tianjin City was divided into sixteen districts. It was not until April 1 this year that the urban area was re-divided, and today it is only distinguished into eight districts. The original road names have been completely changed. Generally, the former French concession is called Zhongjing, Zhongwei, and Xikai Roads; the former Italian concession is called Hedong Roads; the former Austrian concession is called Jintang Roads; and the former British concession is called Nanjing or Nanwei Roads. As for the police stations, they are divided into twelve sub-bureaus. Except for the first, sixth, eighth, and seventh districts, which have two sub-bureaus each, the remaining districts have one sub-bureau each. In addition, the Public Works Bureau, the Tax Collection Office, and the Health Office all have branch offices set up according to each district.</p>
<p>The Unification of Municipal Administration</p>
<p>Tianjin's municipal administration has thus embarked on a path of unification, which of course cannot but be attributed to the assistance of the Allied Powers. Especially after the return of the various concessions, except for the original personnel of the French concession who remained in office due to treaty relations, all others left their posts. Therefore, today's Tianjin City can be said to be a completely independent and autonomous city of our country, and we have high expectations for it. In particular, this situation is very worthy of reference for people from Shanghai, because in today's Tianjin Municipal Government or Police Bureau, there is simply not a single foreign official. The Allied Powers, except for one advisor and four assistant advisors in the Municipal Government (one stationed in the Police Bureau, one in the Finance Bureau, and the other two stationed in other bureaus), and one to two commissioners in each bureau, simply do not interfere in our country's municipal administration. The so-called commissioners are only liaison officers, and the advisors do indeed only have a consultative role!</p>
<p>The Tianjin Municipal Government organization has two offices under the mayor: the Secretariat and the Propaganda Office, and six bureaus: Social Affairs, Finance, Police, Education, Health, and Economy. As for each district, there is one district chief and two assistants, divided into four groups: General Affairs, Publicity and Guidance, Compilation and Training, and Rationing. The so-called compilation and training refers to the compilation and training of police defense groups (bao jia). According to Mayor Zhang, the general public rationing in Tianjin today can ideally be 20 catties of wheat flour or mixed grains per person per month. Major materials such as wheat are absolutely prohibited from being bought and sold privately during the annual purchase period, and can be freely bought and sold after the purchase period has passed.</p>
<p>Lagging Education and Rising Living Costs</p>
<p>In terms of education, Tianjin is clearly not as developed as Beijing. Today, they still only have 104 municipal elementary schools, while there are 153 private schools. There are three municipal middle schools for boys and two for girls, two municipal vocational schools, one municipal normal school, 22 private middle schools, three private vocational schools, and 22 private middle schools. There is only one university, the Catholic-run Business and Industry College. Of course, in Tianjin's population of 1.8 million, this number is extremely small. According to Mayor Zhang, they are currently negotiating with the central government to establish a university.</p>
<p>Affected by the widespread rise in prices, Tianjin's cost of living index is also rising monthly, and may be even more expensive than Beijing. However, it is cheaper to take a rickshaw or handcart here than in Beijing, and you don't have to bargain. You can pay whatever you want when you arrive at your destination, and the driver will never argue with you, which is a relatively pleasant thing. But the lives of the civil servants here are still extremely pitiful. The average salary is only about 2,000 yuan, which is indeed suffering in this era!</p>
