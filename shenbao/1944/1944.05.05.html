<h3 id="c1">市政諮詢委員會　當前課題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>上海市政諮詢委員會，已於本月一日正式成立，據一般觀察，市民對此新機構的未來發展，表示很深的關切和期待。所以，諮詢委員會應該如何重視本身任務，盡其應盡的責任？確是值得討論的問題</p>
<p>陳市長說：「諮詢委員會的性質與普通民意機關不同，普通民意機關形式上多少和政府對立，而諮詢委員會則在實質上和政府一體，一面可以代達民意，一面可以協助政府」。其次，該會組織方面决定原則第一項：「諮詢委員會之任務，一方面備市政當局諮詢，一方面博採市民輿情，向市政當局建</p>
<p>什麽是博採興情呢？就是積極的對於市民合理的要求，合理的希望，轉達當局，盼望當局充分加以考慮，儘可能接受施行。什麽是下情上達呢？就是消極的力求減少戰時人民不必要的痛苦，尤其是市民過去所受的非法壓迫與敲詐，一定要代表請求政府，凡是公務機關對於市民的非法壓迫與敲詐，予以消滅，今後不再發生。同時，布望市民本於忠實，遭受非法壓迫與敲詐時，儘量向諮詢委員會報告。</p>
<p>其次，諮詢委員會雖非正式民意機關，其地位亦與政府並不對立。可是，在此戰時，就是正式民意機關，也不應與政府對立，因為戰時民意機關之整個目的，在於溝通官民意見，俾和衷共濟，發生團結力量，貢獻於戰爭，以期確保勝利。諮詢委員會不但做到下情上達，同時，更應將政府意旨傳達市民，盡其溝通的責任，我們可　以吿訴市民的，陳市長在諮詢會成立致詞中，所表示的光明坦白的態度。他說：「諸位均請知無不言，言無不盡，更希望不祇不行並希望共同進行。而本人亦惟有知無不行，行無不力，縱力有不逮，亦當鍥而不捨，彼此互相砥礪。」</p>
<p>我們認為目前上海市政中，應先解決者，厥為財政問題。如何整理稅收，如何取消包稅制度，如何使稅收公款，不由中間人私飽分文，即使包稅制度，在改革過程中，不能立即取消，也應採用公開招標方式，防止壟斷包辦。財政整頓以後，必可增加收入，充實經費，然後對於公務人員，保安隊，警等之薪飽經費充分增加，務使生活安定。果尙嫌不敷，寗願以增稅方法彌補。但能之於市民者，用之於市民福利：取之於地者，用之於地方福利。雖增加市民負擔，亦必贊同。所以，整理財政，充實經費。然後可以確保治安，發揮總力，這是目前市政中重要課題，也就是市政詢委員會協助政。府的重要課題。</p>
<p>最後，我們仍希望正式民意機關從速成，並不因諮詢委員會的成立而延擱攔。一方因為中央政府不先成立，地方政府不能單成立，因此，尤其希望中央民意機關的從早成立。</p>
<h3 id="c2">歐洲第二戰綫的焦點 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>艾森霍華之被任為侵歐軍最高司令官，已三月於茲了。</p>
<p>這三個月間他們的工作，主要的是集中轟炸以德國為主的歐洲大陸。邱吉爾在二月底的演說中老實告訴出來，「現在英美的對德空襲，乃即將到來的侵歐作戰的基礎。」所以注視這轟炸歐洲的趨勢，是計算第二戰綫開始時期的重要關鍵。</p>
<p>自去年底大規模盲炸柏林以來愈演愈烈的英美空軍之轟炸，雖蒙重大損害，仍不分晝夜繼續進行，尤其從二月十九日以後，其規模更趨擴大。</p>
<p>試以轟炸柏林之例來看：一天內參加的機數達一千架，其乘員連戰鬥機駕駛員在內合計一萬二千各，參劃此次出擊的司令部員及地上勤務者達五萬名。一次的爆炸中，向柏林投下炸彈一萬個，燒夷彈三十五萬個。</p>
<p>這種宣傳，即使打一對折，也可見他們怎樣致力於不分皂白的盲炸。他們的企圖，顯然想用這轟炸來消耗德空軍德防衛力量，破壞軍事基地，兵站綫，軍需生產力，儘量減退進攻時的抵抗。</p>
<p>在侵歐根據地的英國本土之各種軍事活動，亦逐漸顯呈這姿態。例如，運輸力的總動員，英東海岸的交通禁止。向英倫南部集中兵力，船團往來的頻繁，美國飛機得大量空輸等等。常然，軍事機密的這樣坦然直陳，也可視為宜傳手段，使大家感到侵歐的即在目前，可是我們不能不相信這當中也有幾分眞實性。</p>
<p>登陸時間地點</p>
<p>那麽，究竟幾時登錄呢？當然，要正確地答覆說是某月某日，是不可能的。這常要看力一個相對的要素，即德國防衛態勢的強度如何？所以不單是達西洋防壁的防禦力，「歐洲空中戰爭」的歸趨如何，也具有決定的影響。德空軍的邀擊愈强，侵歐就不能不愈拖延期。</p>
<p>此外，東部戰綫的戰况，政治的變動等，也應該加以考慮。廣泛的說來，德國的戰爭力，就是直接的因子。</p>
<p>那麽，假使眞的登陸，其地點是何處呢？關於這問題，所謂「安樂椅子戰略家」的觀測，議論紛紜，莫衷一是。但從最近的大勢看來，他們的目標，在英法海峽方面，法國北部。英美深知此為冒險之舉，其成否決定最後的勝敗，如果真要侵歐，不派兵到距德本國最近的主要戰場，就沒有意義。從海上運輸之點而言，英法海峽的距離僅三十五公里，而最近特別說及的，主要戰塲應該在基地戰鬥機的行動　內。這是因為要以大規模空軍力獲得制空權試行登陸，對抗德國邀擊機的戰鬥機是不可缺的要素。</p>
<p>最近的轟炸，專集中於法國北部的加萊區城。這一區域中德軍的防備。在英法海峽的運輸作戰上，實為極大的威脅，敵方無論如何先要設法擊毀的。</p>
<p>從這些企圖看來，北起鄧寇克，南至波洛臬，阿浦維爾，所謂英法海峽沿岸，將成為侵歐的第一個登陸候補地點。</p>
<p>南義戰綫一瞥</p>
<p>再說南義戰綫，最近的悄報，亞歷山大軍正在加强，並密切聯絡南斯拉夫的契特政權，因而巴爾幹風雲也見緊張起來。但這都可視為第二戰綫的側面作戰。</p>
<p>但無論怎樣，德方對此已早由準備。倫特許台德元帥　下七十萬大軍，配備在從挪威到法義國境的大西洋沿岸。充分硏究了敵方戰略而築造的第二歐洲要塞，大西洋防壁第二道陣綫，也已完成。所以敵方的企圖，不信能夠輕易實現。（翔：譯自朝日畫報四月五日號）</p>

<p>柏林四日中央社電　蘇軍二日於羅馬尼亞東部塞勒特河中流開始新攻勢後，德軍當局曾於三日說明該地區戰况如次：蘇軍二日於塞勒特河中流地區，曾以多數步兵師團及戰車約三百五十輛，開始大規模進攻，蘇軍此次攻擊重點，為塞勒特河兩岸及塔爾克福爾毛斯地區（雅西西方），蘇軍沿雅西至巳斯加尼鐵道綫，對於巴斯加尼與塔爾古福爾毛斯中間之德·羅軍陣地，不斷加以攻擊。同時，並企圖出入於諾曼·彼阿特拉兩市，直抵喀爾巴阡山麓，但軸心軍據守該方而之縱橫陣地，巳將其擊退。一日蘇軍計出動戰車三百五十兩，實施進攻，搜德·羅空軍猛攻之結果，蘇軍戰車集團，曾遭崩潰之打擊，計損失戰車二百四十輛以上·同時，於該戰關中，德空軍擊落蘇機三十二架，德軍損失三架，蘇軍於一日之攻擊失敗後，並未中止其企圖，三日晨仍繼續攻擊，此役雖不能確定係蘇軍大攻勢之開始，但至少可認為係大攻勢之前奏，此外科威爾西南方戰綫巳開始逐漸活躍，該方面集結之蘇軍大部隊，前衛已向德軍陣地開始接近中。</p>

<h3 id="c37">印度前綫日軍　與大自然搏鬭記 <a href="#c37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>印度前綫的作戰，也是與大自然的搏鬭，河水·草木·月亮·野獸·與戰爭結合時，一變了原來的面目。</p>
<p>水</p>
<p>進攻印度的日軍，一面找尋敵軍，一面找着水喝，北部阿拉坎山脈密林地帶，乾季一來臨，什麽都乾乾燥燥，雨季過去，半年的當中未曾落下一滴的雨水。當此乾燥季節，一切的動物爲拼命求尋水喝。密林中千萬不可小便，因爲有時候渴望着水的豹，要自遠方迫近來。</p>
<p>自戈內迪比克到頓紥恩的印緬國境地至齊卡，蘇拉江普爾的印度兩地產，不過有數平方浬的水源數處而已。距陣地有數百公尺乃至數哩的深山谿谷間，有潺潺的淸水湧出，這一些水而且要分數部隊使用，每天使用的永有一定的量。於標高達八千呎剩的波時懷特要塞附近的戰役，乃以水源為中心對峙數日，敵方於白畫要水，這邊即夜間打水，互相輪流使用着一個水源，在峻坡上寫着字說：「此去不遠有美人」。為着運搬水和探尋水源，曾有幾個戰友犧牲。</p>
<p>草</p>
<p>草並不是食糧，但是可以吃的。要越過三個山來也覺得有味。草葉，樹裏，這密林中的蔬菜為前綫的常識。樹木的性質。靑草的種類，使印度前綫的兵士，都成了植物學者</p>
<p>月月色明亮，山峯溪谿，一個月的一半爲皎潔的明月所照，月夜敵方的轟炸機按照時刻，準定來襲。連勢如破竹進攻的日軍北上部隊長都向着左右的兵士說：「暗黑的夜是如何的舒適呀。」於是在黑夜裏行軍。月兒，道是怎樣地使運輸部隊不利呵。奇襲部隊與月影，為一切作戰行動基準的月亮，予前綫以光明，但無論是怎樣的美麗的月亮，其在印度作戰上，也要變了面目，不但沒有效果，反而阻碍了。</p>
<p>野獸</p>
<p>進攻印度的途上，有象。馬·牛車·野羊·犬參加隊伍，各種各樣的動物，都各有任務。象的勞働一天決不超過四小時，其剩二十小時放它在密林中吃一百根的香蕉，但是它們在工作的時候，可以一次背負一百二十公斤重的東西，行二十剩哩。拖着砲和，運搬着行李的象羣，車砲彈的炸裂也並不動搖的牛軍隊伍，常做輸運之用與食糧之用，和日軍一塊兒越過密林，開入印度。</p>
<p>這動物戰綫的話題，延及樓居印緬國境的野獸。步哨或挺進部隊時常碰到虎或豹，有的部隊狩獵象子，吃它的肉，有的部隊却不敢吃它。又人所聚集的地方，烏鴉便聚集弄來，所謂「烏之所聚，敵之所在。」於此而益信。在印度戰塲上，敵人也被我們所利用了。（弘譯自四月十五日朝日新聞。）</p>
<h3 id="c38">緬印上空的　敵木製飛機 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>敵英木製「蚊式」飛機，最近傳在緬甸上空出現。這種飛機是英國軍用飛機中最優越的，具有種種的特長。英國曾誇稱為「世界最高速度的轟炸機。同時，在戰鬥機，偵察機，襲擊機無論何種使用上，都無出其右。」</p>
<p>這種飛機最大的特長，為全身幾乎究全為木製的。其優點為：　金屬飛機在兩三百公里外，巳可用電波兵器測知，木製飛機在飛行時，可以不受電波兵器的反射，所以是極好的奇製兵器。　金屬資源不是時，可用木材補充。　製造工程簡單，可以大量生產。</p>
<p>該式飛機，翼幅一六·五一公尺，全長一二。四三公尺，全高四·六五公尺。最高速度每小時六百〇五公尺，可裝載炸彌九百公斤。並可在一萬公尺高空上，作長時間飛行。除作轟炸機外，兼可作偵察機襲擊機，充分發揮其特性。（譯自二月號飛行少年）</p>

<p>— 辛履</p>
<p>濛濛的細雨裏，黃昏悄悄地趕早爬進了屋子，裴老先生用手抹一抹老花眼鏡的鏡片，挺一挺傴僂的背脊，輕輕地舒了一口氣，又重新埋下頭去，讀那二女今天從家鄉寄來的快信：</p>
<p>爸爸：</p>
<p>算算日子是春天了，但氣候像扭不過來似的，還是那麽料峭，有風吹來尖厲徹骨。</p>
<p>媽還是整夜的咳嗽氣喘，有時咳得淚水直淌，像要把腸胃一起咳出來的，直到咳得全身軟癱，才又換回一口氣。</p>
<p>奶身體是越來越不成了，每天吃點稀粥湯，有什麽用，却又老是東掛西牽的不放心爸爸，惦着哥哥嫂嫂，念着姊姊。白天還硬支撐起米收拾屋子，要我站着看她，於是裝着笑（其實這慘得那裏像笑呢？）對我說：「麗芳：妳為了娘荒了半年的學業了，妳回到爸那兒去，回到學校裏去唸書吧！我不是自己能料理的嗎？」</p>
<p>媽要我回來，她已意識到自巳是飄搖在風中之燭了，我聽了好不難受。</p>
<p>鄕下物價比去年底又漲了二三倍，眼看手頭的錢又不能支持多少天了。</p>
<p>費老先生的心沉重得像一個鐵錘，他沒有讀完道為信，眼淚巳從他的鏡片裏掉出來了，他體味到一種眞眞的悲哀，爲敎育事業勞瘁了三十多年，結果祇落得一個支離破碎的家庭，三十年來敎育多少弟子，却不能支持自己子弟的敎育，服務社會三十年，却不能救活自己垂死的妻子，為了神聖的敎育事業，三十年來他流盡了自巳的血汗。但是，他得到的報償呢？賢惠的相隨了二十九年的妻，因為沒有錢住療養院，打空氣針，只好眼睜睜地看她將被死神獲去，聰穎的大女兒蕙芳，為了支持一家的生活，也勢將捲進職業圈的漩渦，家裏有的是一大羣因着營養不良而顯得　弱的孩子。</p>
<p>裴老先生兩手支撑着下巴，呆呆地望着昏暗的屋角，讓愁緒像毒蛇似的繼着他。</p>
<p>爺爺！爺爺的耀兒挨近祖父的膝邊，親切地呌着。</p>
<p>「唔！乘孩子！放學了嗎？哥哥呢？」裴老先生除下了眼鏡，摸摸孫兒的面頰。</p>
<p>「哥哥在樓下幫媽媽做煤球，好玩哩！一個一個搓得圓圓的！」孩子興頭上的話；直刺着祖父底心，第三代的命運比第二代的更慘了。</p>
<p>「爸！」蕙芳從學校裏面來，頭髮上停着雨，單衫也微濕了，但她的精神顯然很興奮，「您瞧！這隻老鼠是今天學校裹生物實騐課上，我親手解剖的，老師說我有超特的解剖技術，這小動物的臟腑器官任何小機構都沒剖壞呢！」說着她把四肢釘在紙板上的傑作遞給父親看</p>
<p>很使蕙芳失望的，父親沒有給予任何誇獎的話，只把嘴唇動了一動，用九展開了一個充滿了疲乏的慈祥的笑。</p>
<p>蕙芳不自禁地打了一個寒噤，感到今天屋子裏的空氣有些異樣。</p>
<p>果然，她看到了一封麗芳自鄉間的來信。</p>
<p>她急遽的走近書桌，木然地落在旁澳的一隻椅子裏，默默地看完信。</p>
<p>半年了，於是她記起了去秋媽回到故鄉去養病的一幕：</p>
<p>回去的前晚，媽決定帶妹妹同去。</p>
<p>次晨是一個多霧的陰天，蕙芳隨爸爸哥哥送　上船，哥哥在事前託好同鄕人茶房阿榮，到碼頭時，把行李都交給了他。當母親搖曳的身子，雜在推呀擠呀的隊伍裏，沒入船艙中時，蕙芳心裏突然一陣空虛，眼簾模糊了，她隱約地服見母親又回過頭來，她愴惶地裝成一個極勉强的笑，想到這裏，黃芳又不禁流出淚水來了。</p>
<p>裴老先生想安慰一下正沉浸在苦惱中的女兒，但他不能想出一句適當的話，加之另外一件事在困擾他的思想：到底要不要告訴蕙芳？外甥巳經介紹她到××企業公司去擔任記賬員了。</p>
<p>裴老先生好幾次把巳經衝到舌尖上的話，又吞了下去，對於　數的女兒蕙芳，做父親的好像不應該去剝奪她讀書的權利，蕙芳進中學以來，從沒繳納過一次學費，每期得獎學金，去年他到蕙芳的學校裏去，她的級任張老師還富面稱讚過蕙芳：「這孩子很有天才，又肯刻苦，裝先生好好地給她受敎育，正是前途無量？」</p>
<p>於是，費老先生懷善戞鬰的憐惜站起米，以充滿了熱愛的手，撫着蕙芳的頭：「好孩予，你是應該有權利去受敎育的！」</p>
<p>蕙芳正在體味父親這句話的由來，不經意的却被書桌上的一張卞片吸住了：</p>
<p>「茲介紹裴蕙芳女士　前來　責公司任職祈予　賜洽為于荷此致　××企業公司　×總經理××　名正肅」</p>
<p>另一而印着「謝旭」二字。</p>
<p>「爸爸：表哥來過了？」蕙芳被意外的發現惶惑了。</p>
<p>「嗯！你表哥說，這是……一個……機會，担任記照員，忙是相富忙的，但公司裏供應食，每月連津貼也能拿到一千多元錢。」裴老先生艱　地吐出這幾句話，他是惟恐傷了女兒的心呵。</p>
<p>「明天，就是明天，非得與學校告別了嗎？」蕙芳這樣問自己，這件來得意外的事情，拑住了蕙芳的心。</p>
<p>「難道就這麼快要和學校生活吿別了嗎？」蕙芳幾乎不相信似的反復問自己，她直覺地以爲這是不可能的事情，可是為了減輕爸爸的負担，這又不眞是一個機會嗎？何况，就業還是自己先向爸爸提起過的。</p>
<p>她舉起頭來望望年巡的爸爸，覺察父親今天臉上的皺紋，好像更深了，籠在這滿頭白髮下面的，是積累多少心酸的記錄啊！父親一星期敎了三十小時的書，還得担任二個家庭敎師，一個月拿不到三千元錢，父親是太辛苦了。爲了帮助爸爸減輕家庭的負担，她覺得除了答允以外，是不容許有別的考慮的。</p>
<p>蕙芳忍住了滿眶的淚水，抑制着自己的感情，竭力裝着愉快的聲調說：「爸爸！那麽我明天就去接洽！」</p>
<p>其實，慘白的臉色掩蓋不住她悲痛的神情。</p>
<p>「孩子！爸扼殺了你的天才了！」裴老先生用顫抖的手撫女兒低垂的頭。</p>
<p>「可是，我還年輕呢！做一二年事情，等時局轉好一點時，不還來得及去讀書嗎？何况，讀書不一定要學校，我可以自修。」蕙芳祗能把對於明日的把握去安慰父親了。</p>
<p>晚飯以後，裴老先生改了一疊課卷，照例呼喚着孩子們安睡了，也許他今天不願侵擾　芳煩亂的思緒，他例外地容許女兒還在書桌上沉思，屋子裏跟着靜寂起來，祗有淅瀝的雨聲和着晚風在凄厲的奏着悲曲。</p>
<p>蕙芳開始撫摩她親切的書包，不經意的翻開自巳的課卷，她輕聲地歡了一口氣，「別了，我親愛的伙伴，明天起，我不能不離開你們到一個新的環境裏去了　」她默默地和她的書木與踝卷告別。</p>
<p>「我應該去做事情的。」蕙芳這樣想：「公司奠定了飯，家裏便可以減少一個人的開支，何况，每個月發了薪水，還多少可以貼補家用。」她想到月底可以拿一千塊錢薪水，似乎把繼緊的心略爲　了一點兕，她正在支配這一千塊錢的用途，拿一半寄給鄕間養病的娘，留下最低限度的事資，其剩全交給爸爸，可是，她又忽然覺得自巳想得太遠了，因為明天就要離開學校，在她幾乎是不能置信的事</p>
<p>於是學校生活的影子又鮮明地展現在蕙芳的眼前：</p>
<p>明天又是星期五了，課後照例有個辯論會，經常每個星期開始，由級會學藝股决定一個題目，同學們便分別參加正反兩面，分頭去搜集材料，辯論的進行中，她們各自反覆引伸考證，參酌自巳的意見，率直的駁斥，坦白的批評，她們常常把剛在論理學上學到的矛盾律是非法搬出來運用，通過了幾個面紅耳赤的高潮：終於給她們找出了眞理，然後，雙方的感情復歸於統一</p>
<p>司是，明天的辯論會，她不能把自己準備成熟的材料去和對方作劇烈的爭辯了，於是，她難受的扭過頭去，無意中看見了今天課上解剖的老鼠。</p>
<p>生物實騐眞是生動的科目啊！何况，她的解剖手腕又出色，顯微鏡中淸楚了面目，使她們領略了理論證實時的情趣。</p>
<p>但幾何呢？那是訓練思考最好的功課，由題意一層一層推想進去，轉灣抹角探索得核心，難題的解出，眞有不可言喩的快樂。</p>
<p>由于旺盛的求知慾，她是幾乎沒有一門不愛的功課，因此不能不想起英文先生朗誦詩篇時動聽的音韻，使全級沉入恬靜少境，但當先生敎到林肯演說辭時，她們的熱血全給沸騰了。</p>
<p>史地先生廣博的生動的材料，每每呌她們聽得神往，但是，先生却常常突然收住了來一個問題，不讓她們的嘴太寂寞。</p>
<p>最後，她想起了文學造詣極深的國文敎師，他喜歡講世界大文豪的學習故事，要她們從實生活山去找學問，要她們多練習寫，即使是沒有通過喉嚨的腹部發音，但，這表現了稚抽美，這是正義的呼聲。</p>
<p>課　裏的緊張，並沒有忘却戶外活動；課餘飯後，她們也活躍于乒乓檯旁，排球塲中。</p>
<p>快春假了，又是她們遠征郊外的季節呵！</p>
<p>怎奈，閃耀在眼前的那些生動的畫面，從明天起就不能再相親了，她明天將闖入一個完全陌生的公司裏去做自己不熱悉的工作，每天看見的將不再是活潑的年輕的同學，和靄的老師，而是每天要在鍍金的市招下，走進寬敞的寫字間去，踐着雪亮的地板，伏在發光的寫字　上，在算盤與電話的呌囂中，讓自己的生命，用不盡的數字塡無窮的帳冊中浪費掉。</p>
<p>雜繁複的思想蠶食着蕙芳的心，她抬起頭來舒一口抑鬱的氣，眼光落在板壁上一個鏡框裏，她看見了父親年輕時代的相片，是那麽英氣勃勃，那麽挺秀的爸爸啊！但無情的歲月，帶走了她爸爸的靑春，父親老了，尤其是母親回鄕的半年來，像老得更快了，而且，母親呢？為了沒有錢好好醫她的肺結核，恐怕巳不能活得太久了，一個黑影掠過她的眼前，她不禁又簌簌地流下眼淚來。</p>
<p>時節巳鄧鐙地敲了十二下，爸爸在隔房呌喊了：「蕙芳！睡吧！時間不早了。」</p>
<p>「爸爸！就來了！」</p>
<p>她匆忙地疊齊了瞑想時翻亂的書，熄了燈，站起來，聽見雨下得更大了，風也緊得使玻琍窗直响，遙遙地在弄堂口又傳來一陣凄厲尖銳的乞討聲。在悲劇的事間，生活的步伐是太艱辛了！</p>
<p>她又嘆了一口氣，　足走進臥房去。</p>
<h3 id="c40">勇士之歌 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>

<p>英美將在歐洲開　第二嚴綫，其地點何在，一般觀測家都認為在英法峽方面，最有可能。觀於英美空軍最近的轟炸，策中於活動能力北部加萊區域。這一區域中德軍的防備，在英法海峽的運輸作戰上，實為最大的威脅，敵方無如何非加壞不方無如何非加以破壞不可。從此可知法國沿海北起起鄧寇克，南至波洛臬，阿浦維爾，即所謂英法海峽區域，將成為侵歐的一個候補地點。</p>
<p>但德方對於敵人早有準備，在從挪威到法義國境的大西洋沿岸，駐紥大軍七十萬，建築了堅固不拔的要塞，準備予登陸敵人以近頭痛繫。（請參閱今日本報第一段所戲「第二戰綫的焦點」一文。）</p>

<p>即爲全滬公開籃球甲組總決賽本月十日晚八時半在中靑舉行　願社會人士踴躍輸將嘉惠淸寒學子</p>
<p>本報助學金之善舉，嘉惠一般靑年學子，為國家培植人材，故早為各界重視，共襄善事。舉辦以來，承社會人士之踴躍輸將，本報同人之努力，以迄於今，其成績固不待記者曉曉也。迺者本報因鑒於球類運動之勃盛，每塲比賽，觀衆　超乎理想，盛况空前。故決舉行申報助學金足籃球義賽，巳由本報陳社長與各有關方面接洽妥當，各方面亦以事關公益，樂予接受，故進行頗為順利。</p>
<h3 id="c45">足球義賽　邀請東華僑聯會師 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>足球方面—巳接治東華僑聯，騁變方慨允，熱忱可風。其與賽日期及其他一切，容再公佈。</p>
<p>籃球方面—全滬公開籃球聯賽甲組總決賽中北對仁餘。定於本月十日（下餘期三）下午八時半在八仙橋靑年會健身房舉行。籃球委員會諸公急公好義，以總決賽一幕，兼為本報助學金義賽，一舉兩得，深感委員會諸公之善謀。</p>
<p>中北仁剩兩隊，各擁名將，分別得全滬公開籃球甲組一部二部冠軍，舉行總決賽。屆時旣兼助學金義賽。票價勢必略事提高。除原價仍由票款中提交籃球會，一切開支由本報擔任外，所得票款，均涓滴歸公，以為助學金之用。則記者預料是夕球迷定必爭先恐後，蓋旣得欣賞球藝，亦共襄善舉，何樂不為，先謹代獲助學生嗚謝焉。</p>
<h3 id="c46">中北各個技術　堪稱滬上獨一 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>中北隊隊員，除陳學崇外，均係北國健兒。其作風不脫北派，為滬上唯一之北方球隊，故極為一般球迷所愛戴。最顯著之特點，為各個技術特佳，其能迭克勁敵，不無因也。且賴汪仲陶戴昌齡之善於領導，不論對賽前賽後之指摘，與夫臨陣之隨機應變，均有獨到之處。此次加入全滬公開籃球賽甲一部，戰無不勝，攻無不克，僅剩對華聯藥之一塲，原定於上月二十五日比賽，不幸臨時以球塲秩序關係，以致未克成賽，殊為遺憾。茲以華聯藥之自願放權利，中北遂獲得甲一部之冠軍。茲介紹該隊</p>
<p>注仲陶——為該隊隊長，任後衛之職，極有經騐。臨大陣而不亂，最為可貴。唯邇來似以身體欠壯，不能支持全局為吃虧。然塲外調度，有賴於汪君者甚重，故應為該隊之中心人物。</p>
<p>李震中——身材甚高，球藝精湛，目下滬上最受球迷歡迎之球員。全隊進攻退守，繫於震中一人之身。其籃下截球，百無一失。出球之準確與敏捷，決非其他球員能望其項背。而遠射之美麗，尤屬球壇少見。故震中實籃球界中寵兒，有人譽之為「球王」不為過也。</p>
<p>沈聿恭——為中國世界運動會之選手，程度不言可喻。其唯一特點，為左手角底妙射，神出鬼沒。愈受阻擋，愈能出奇制勝，誠奇才也，爲該隊獲分之鑰。</p>
<p>陳學崇——中北隊唯一之粵產球員。學崇之作風，與北派相同。前華星隊之一切，巳足證明戰路之無異。學崇彈性充足，縱躍之高，籃下得球，最佔上風。</p>
<p>徐兆熊——與聿恭同出席世運，唯年來身體發福，稍有力不從心之感。觀乎其傳遞之妙，接濟有路，不失老將風度。</p>
<p>趙雅林——即北星隊之領隊，雖年事尙靑，一切已具經騐，非特對球隊球員，應付於方，其待人接物，亦面面俱到，人稱少年老成。其作戰時之勇敢，則有大刀闊斧之氣概，與塲外之一副功架，迥然不同。</p>
<p>李寳中——北派中之南方化，打球時，笑容滿面，出手亦以柔勝。然在笑柔之中，却決不肯輕易放鬆敵人，球迷呼之為「笑面老虎」，賽中受之無愧。</p>

<p>仁餘隊係談星波所領導，延有前滬江名將梁國歸及持志全盛時代之夏澤人兩君為策劃，且有余郇子之肯硏究。該隊不論在攻在守，均有相當方法。粗視之，似覺毫無噱頭，細察之，則彌覺其能應用方法為可貴也。此番加入公開籃殊賽，抽人甲二部中，術之所至，衆皆屈服，尤以最後勝番將蒙諾克之一役，信乎其方法之勝人為值得贊揚也。該隊對為獲球權相當認識，決不浪擲失却無謂之球，故與該隊戰，大都在膠着狀態中，得分較少也。再介紹各個隊員。</p>
<p>余郇子—為用方法之策動人，左右前後，俱出諸於余君之指揮。老余頭頭是道，極少失着，為同隊隊員所敬仰。其缺點係略患近視，射籃方面，受相當影響。</p>
<p>李肇和—亦係近視眼。帶眼鏡上塲，並加罩。視綫方面，尙不致妨礙。李君任中鋒，賴體格較高，彈力尙足，極能搶籃下之球。得意傑作，爲籃前一記反身。絕無遠射，果屬吃虧，亦其美點也。</p>
<p>林維聰—有小林少稱，可見其正當年靑之秋。賴衷氣之足，不避一切。作風殺辣，當者披糜。其投籃有順逆，未能有所定論。總之，小林不愧爲一良好前鋒人材。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Current Issues for the Municipal Advisory Committee <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee was officially established on the first of this month. According to general observations, citizens have expressed deep concern and anticipation for the future development of this new institution. Therefore, how should the Advisory Committee value its own tasks and fulfill its due responsibilities? This is indeed a question worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen said: "The nature of the Advisory Committee is different from that of ordinary public opinion organs. Ordinary public opinion organs are somewhat opposed to the government in form, while the Advisory Committee is essentially integrated with the government. On the one hand, it can convey public opinion, and on the other hand, it can assist the government." Secondly, the first item of the principle decided on the organization of the committee is: "The task of the Advisory Committee is, on the one hand, to provide consultation to the municipal authorities, and on the other hand, to extensively collect public opinion from the citizens and make suggestions to the municipal authorities."</p>
<p>What is "extensively collecting public sentiment"? It means actively conveying reasonable demands and reasonable hopes of the citizens to the authorities, hoping that the authorities will fully consider them and accept them for implementation as much as possible. What is "reporting the situation below"? It means passively striving to reduce unnecessary suffering of the people during the war, especially the illegal oppression and extortion suffered by the citizens in the past. It is necessary to represent and request the government to eliminate the illegal oppression and extortion of citizens by public institutions and prevent it from happening again in the future. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens will report to the Advisory Committee as much as possible when they suffer illegal oppression and extortion based on loyalty.</p>
<p>Secondly, although the Advisory Committee is not a formal public opinion organ, its position is not opposed to the government. However, in this wartime, even formal public opinion organs should not be opposed to the government, because the entire purpose of public opinion organs in wartime is to communicate the opinions of officials and the people, so as to work together harmoniously, generate united strength, and contribute to the war, in order to ensure victory. The Advisory Committee should not only report the situation below, but also convey the government's intentions to the citizens, fulfilling its responsibility of communication. What we can tell the citizens is the bright and frank attitude expressed by Mayor Chen in his address at the establishment of the Advisory Committee. He said: "I hope that you will all know everything and say everything, and I hope that you will not only not act, but also hope to act together. And I myself will only know everything and act with all my strength. Even if my strength is insufficient, I should persevere and encourage each other."</p>
<p>We believe that the first thing to be solved in Shanghai's municipal administration is the financial problem. How to reorganize tax revenue, how to abolish the tax farming system, how to ensure that tax revenue and public funds are not privately pocketed by middlemen, even if the tax farming system cannot be abolished immediately in the reform process, it should also adopt open bidding methods to prevent monopoly contracting. After the financial reorganization, it will inevitably increase revenue and enrich funds, and then the salaries and expenses of public officials, security teams, police, etc. will be fully increased, so as to stabilize their lives. If it is still insufficient, it is better to make up for it by increasing taxes. But what can be used for the benefit of the citizens should be used for the welfare of the citizens; what is taken from the land should be used for the welfare of the local area. Even if it increases the burden on the citizens, it will definitely be supported. Therefore, reorganizing finances and enriching funds can ensure public security and exert overall strength. This is an important issue in the current municipal administration, and it is also an important issue for the Municipal Advisory Committee to assist the government.</p>
<p>Finally, we still hope that the formal public opinion organs will be established as soon as possible, and will not be delayed or blocked due to the establishment of the Advisory Committee. On the one hand, because the central government is not established first, the local governments cannot be established alone. Therefore, we especially hope that the central public opinion organs will be established as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Focal Point of the Second European Front <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>It has been three months since Eisenhower was appointed as the Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force.</p>
<p>During these three months, their main task was to concentrate on bombing the European continent, mainly Germany. Churchill honestly told in his speech at the end of February that "the current Anglo-American air raids on Germany are the basis for the upcoming invasion of Europe." Therefore, paying attention to the trend of bombing Europe is an important key to calculating the start date of the second front.</p>
<p>The bombing by the Anglo-American air force, which has intensified since the large-scale indiscriminate bombing of Berlin at the end of last year, continues day and night despite suffering heavy damage. Especially since February 19, its scale has become even larger.</p>
<p>Take the example of bombing Berlin: the number of aircraft participating in one day reached 1,000, and the number of crew members, including fighter pilots, totaled 12,000. The number of headquarters staff and ground service personnel involved in this attack reached 50,000. In one bombing, 10,000 bombs and 350,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on Berlin.</p>
<p>Even if this propaganda is halved, it can be seen how they are committed to indiscriminate bombing. Their attempt is obviously to use this bombing to consume the German air force's defense capabilities, destroy military bases, supply lines, and military production capacity, and reduce resistance during the invasion as much as possible.</p>
<p>Various military activities on the British mainland, the base for the invasion of Europe, are also gradually showing this posture. For example, the general mobilization of transportation capacity, the traffic ban on the east coast of England. The concentration of troops in southern England, the frequent traffic of convoys, and the massive air transport of American aircraft. Of course, such frank statements of military secrets can also be regarded as a means of propaganda, making everyone feel that the invasion of Europe is imminent, but we cannot but believe that there is some truth in it.</p>
<p>Landing Time and Location</p>
<p>So, when exactly will the landing take place? Of course, it is impossible to answer correctly that it will be on a certain day of a certain month. This often depends on a relative factor, that is, the strength of Germany's defensive posture. Therefore, it is not only the defensive power of the Atlantic Wall, but also the trend of the "European Air War" that has a decisive influence. The stronger the German air force's interception, the more the invasion of Europe will have to be delayed.</p>
<p>In addition, the war situation on the Eastern Front and political changes should also be considered. Broadly speaking, Germany's war power is the direct factor.</p>
<p>So, if the landing really takes place, where will it be? Regarding this question, the observations of so-called "armchair strategists" are divergent and inconclusive. But from the recent trend, their target is in the English Channel area, northern France. The Anglo-Americans know that this is a risky move, and its success or failure will determine the final victory or defeat. If they really want to invade Europe, it is meaningless not to send troops to the main battlefield closest to Germany itself. From the point of view of maritime transportation, the distance of the English Channel is only 35 kilometers, and recently it has been particularly mentioned that the main battlefield should be within the range of action of the base fighter planes. This is because it is an indispensable factor to use large-scale air force to gain air supremacy to try to land, and to fight against German interceptor planes.</p>
<p>The recent bombing has been concentrated in the Calais area of northern France. The German army's defense in this area is a great threat to the transportation operation in the English Channel, and the enemy must find a way to destroy it first.</p>
<p>From these attempts, the so-called English Channel coast, from Dunkirk in the north to Boulogne, Abbeville in the south, will become the first landing candidate site for the invasion of Europe.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Southern Italian Front</p>
<p>Speaking of the Southern Italian Front, according to recent secret reports, the Alexander Army is being strengthened and is closely linked to the Chetnik regime in Yugoslavia, and the situation in the Balkans is also becoming tense. But these can all be regarded as side operations of the Second Front.</p>
<p>But no matter what, the German side has already made preparations for this. Field Marshal Rundstedt has 700,000 troops stationed along the Atlantic coast from Norway to the French-Italian border. The second European fortress, the second line of defense of the Atlantic Wall, which was built after fully studying the enemy's strategy, has also been completed. Therefore, the enemy's attempt, I don't believe, can be easily realized. (翔: Translated from the April 5th issue of Asahi Pictorial)</p>

<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) German News Agency News: German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, in his capacity as the newly appointed Mayor of Berlin, delivered a speech at the recollection of various administrative departments and institutions in Berlin, saying: "I am now taking over this position at a time when the German capital is undergoing difficult training. Since 1943, although the enemy has continued to advance, they have ultimately failed to make the people of the German capital frustrated. This is because the people of Berlin and the leading institutions have a commendable attitude. When the reconstruction work of Berlin is completed, there will be vast and healthy workers' residences, as well as beautiful streets and buildings. After these streets are built, the reputation Berlin has gained in this difficult training will continue to exist, and the damage it has suffered will be forgotten early. Once peace is restored, Berlin will face a great task. The German capital, from a spiritual point of view, is the leader of the capital cities of various countries, and at that time it will contribute all its energy to the future task."</p>
<h3 id="e9">Japanese Army Crosses the Yellow River, Occupies Various Key Points, Captures汜水, 榮陽 and 密縣 <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) On the night of April 17, part of the Japanese army crossed the Great Yellow River, defeated the Yu army at the heights southwest of Luwangcheng, and advanced westward from the south bank of the Yellow River. At 11:00 am on the 31st, they occupied the key point 汜水 and captured 榮陽 and 密縣. They broke through the mountainous area and launched a surprise attack on the enemy troops who were stubbornly resisting in the southern highlands.</p>
<p>Kaifeng, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Japanese army in North China suddenly began to act together on April 18. They crossed the Yellow River from the bridgehead of the Great Yellow River, Bawangcheng, and several locations near Zhongmu on the north bank of the New Yellow River, and divided into several columns, forcing their way to the great plain of Henan. With the cooperation of the air force, they launched a fierce attack on the troops under Tang Enbo, a direct descendant of the Yu Central Army. Since the start of the new operation, after only ten days, they have successively occupied Zhengzhou, 榮陽, 汜水, and the key point of the Pinghan Road, Xinzheng. The important areas of Xuchang and other places are now beginning to carry out mobile operations, and the Yu army is retreating and fleeing in a hurry. According to the report, the Japanese army first gathered near Zhongmu on the north bank of the Yellow River. On the 18th, they eliminated the strong resistance of the Yu army's Provisional 17th Division, about 4,000 people, who were guarding the position on the bank of the New Yellow River, and crossed the Yellow River. The Yu army immediately retreated and fled. A part of the Japanese army that attacked westward occupied Guodian (20 kilometers south of Zhengzhou) on the evening of the 19th, and then encircled the 110th Division (Division Commander Liao Yunze) of the Yu Central Army, which was stationed behind Zhengzhou. They broke into the south gate of the city at 10:00 am on the 20th and occupied it. The Japanese army, which attacked towards Huangji Jianzuozhen, after defeating the newly formed 29th Division (Division Commander Lv Gongliang) and the newly formed 46th Division under the newly formed 15th Army of the Yu army, also captured Weishi Xinzheng. On the 1st, they occupied all of Xuchang. On the night of the 19th, the Japanese army, advancing from Bawangcheng on the Great Yellow River, defeated the 11th Division (Division Commander Jiang Dangchi) of the Provisional 15th Army and the 117th Division (Division Commander Chen Shurui) of the 96th Army of the Yu army on the banks of the Yellow River. On the 21st, they occupied 榮陽 and 汜水 and entered 密縣. Therefore, the first line of defense in Henan formed by the Yu army in 榮陽 and 密縣 completely collapsed. The Japanese army occupied the important area of Xuchang. At the same time, one deputy army commander and two division commanders of the Yu army were killed in action. The commander of the 85th Army was also wounded. Therefore, the forward troops of the Yu army were also in a state of chaos.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Enemy Aircraft and Warships Heavily Damaged South of the Carolines <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported that the enemy mobile unit that appeared on the sea south of the Caroline Islands on April 30 attacked the Truk Islands on April 30 and May 1, and shelled the Mortlock Islands on May 1. After the Japanese air force launched a fierce attack on it, the results of the battle were announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 2nd. It was reported that one enemy aircraft carrier was destroyed, one was damaged, and more than 30 enemy aircraft were shot down. However, after a subsequent investigation, it was clarified that the enemy's losses were even greater. The number of enemy aircraft shot down has been revised to 75 shot down and 25 destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Companies Re-register, Deadline is End of the Month <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that after the deadline for company re-registration at the end of November last year, many companies still stated reasons for failing to apply within the time limit and requested registration for license renewal. After considering a flexible solution, all those who have been approved for establishment registration and licensed in the past should follow the procedures for establishment registration according to the Company Law, but are exempt from the filing of verification procedures and directly submit to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration and license renewal. The implementation period is limited from now until the end of April of this year. For the sake of actual implementation, the period has now expired. There are many who comply with the application, but it is inevitable that some are delayed due to the long distance, lack of procedures, and failure to apply. In order to give extra consideration to the difficulties of merchants, the implementation period of the aforementioned changes will be extended again until the end of May of this year. After the deadline, there will be no further extension. If they still fail to apply within the deadline, it will be considered a voluntary waiver. The registration license they hold should be deemed invalid from June 1, losing the qualification of a legal person of the company and stopping the use of the company name to restrict them.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Soviets Continue to Attack in the Middle Reaches of the Siret River, Germans Believe it is a Prelude to a Major Battle <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) After the Soviet army launched a new offensive in the middle reaches of the Siret River in eastern Romania on the 2nd, the German authorities explained the battle situation in the area on the 3rd as follows: On the 2nd, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive in the middle reaches of the Siret River area with a large number of infantry divisions and about 350 tanks. The focus of the Soviet army's attack was on both sides of the Siret River and the Târgu Frumos area (west of Iași). The Soviet army continuously attacked the German-Romanian positions between Pașcani and Târgu Frumos along the Iași-Chișinău railway line. At the same time, they attempted to enter and exit the cities of Roman and Piatra Neamț and reach the foothills of the Carpathians, but the Axis forces defended the vertical and horizontal positions in that area and repelled them. On the 1st, the Soviet army dispatched a total of 350 tanks to launch an offensive. As a result of the fierce attack by the German-Romanian air force, the Soviet tank group suffered a devastating blow, with more than 240 tanks lost. At the same time, in that battle, the German air force shot down 32 Soviet aircraft, and the German army lost 3 aircraft. After the failure of the Soviet army's attack on the 1st, it did not stop its attempts. It continued to attack on the morning of the 3rd. Although it cannot be determined that this battle is the beginning of a major Soviet offensive, it can at least be regarded as a prelude to a major offensive. In addition, the front line southwest of Kovel has gradually become active. The vanguard of the large Soviet troops assembled in that area has begun to approach the German positions.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Soviets Will Attack Along Three Routes <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) Regarding the war situation on the Eastern Front, although the Soviet Information Bureau once said: There have been no major changes in the twelve days since April 22, but a comprehensive review of the front-line news from the German and Soviet armies knows that the time for the decisive battle is gradually approaching. According to Reuters Moscow News, the future Soviet offensive will have the following three routes: The first is to attack the three Baltic countries in a southwestern direction from the northern front. The second is to attack Warsaw from Minsk on the central front. The third is to pass through the Carpathian Mountains and Romania, and form a pincer attack on the Balkans. According to military observers, the second point is the most likely. During the third winter battle, because there were no large-scale battles on the central front, the large salient area in front of Minsk, which maintained the area from Bobruisk to Mogilev, still belonged to the German army. In order to defeat the German army in this salient area, the Soviet army advanced from Narva towards Lithuania, and covered the offensive of the captured front line from the side. According to recent German news, the Soviet army is currently gathering a large number of troops on the central front and actively preparing for war. The Soviet army is responding to the deployment of the Second Front in Western Europe and mobilizing such a large army, it is conceivable that its intention is to challenge the German army. According to German news, the German army mobilized German labor teams and soldier teams a few days ago to build solid fortress lines in the main war zones on the Eastern Front. The fortress lines were built with reference to the Atlantic fortresses. The German army is waiting for the opportunity to crush the Soviet offensive according to this new defense line.</p>

<p>Ogura, the Supreme Economic Advisor of the National Government, and Aoki, the Chief Economic Advisor, left for Nanjing on the 3rd after staying in Shanghai for a week. Advisor Aoki met with reporters on the afternoon of the 2nd to express his thoughts and aspirations as follows:</p>
<p>What we expect from China is the confidence they hold. In this era of international trade stagnation, the Chinese economy cannot rely on foreign countries. It should make full use of its abundant domestic resources to achieve good results. This is the attitude that the Chinese economic circles should adopt. I will frequently travel between Shanghai and Nanjing in the future to convey the opinions of the Shanghai economic circles to the National Government, in order to achieve close ties between the economic circles of Shanghai and Nanjing. The so-called new policies towards China and the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty will gradually be realized. I believe that issues such as Shanghai's price countermeasures, currency recovery, increased production, and control methods should be resolved comprehensively. At the same time, the prerequisite for currency recovery should be to increase production first. Furthermore, Advisors Ogura and Aoki will set up advisor residences in Shanghai so that one of them can be stationed in Shanghai permanently.</p>

<p>In view of the rising prices in recent years, the Central Reserve Bank has repeatedly supervised its fellow banks to rectify their operations in its capacity as a national bank, in order to curb speculation and hoarding and suppress prices. On the one hand, it also seeks to address the root cause by focusing on increasing production. In March of this year, it formulated points to note for lending to fellow banks and sent a circular to all banks and money shops through its Financial Affairs Inspection Office, requiring them to comply with the regulations for adjusting the market and lending to fellow banks when necessary: (A) The use of funds must absolutely adopt a mortgage system, and the assets and liabilities of each fellow bank should be reviewed and its limit set. Each fellow bank may apply for loans for these funds and use them for various industrial and commercial sectors at any time, or retain them for their own emergency use. (B) Production loans should be based on re-mortgaging by fellow banks. A separate limit should also be set in accordance with the previous provision. The selection of production loans, the borrower's purpose, collateral, the quantity of raw materials purchased, the production situation, the quantity of product sales inventory, and the production capacity should be thoroughly investigated and supervised. If it is discovered that the borrower is misreporting production or that the borrowed funds are not used for direct production, they should be immediately recovered and severely punished. Since the implementation of the aforementioned measures, the bank has gradually reduced its general commercial loans, and production funds can be balanced and adjusted. It is also heard that in order to strengthen the bank's position as a national bank, where the financial institutions in the locations of its various branches and offices are generally organized and sound, the bank has abandoned the business of general commercial banks.</p>

<h3 id="e37">A Record of Japanese Soldiers on the Indian Front Fighting Against Nature <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The operations on the Indian front are also a battle against nature. Rivers, grass, trees, the moon, and wild beasts change their original appearance when combined with war.</p>
<p>Water</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers advancing into India sought both the enemy and water. In the dense forest area of the northern Arakan Mountains, with the arrival of the dry season, everything became dry and arid. After the rainy season, not a single drop of rain fell for half a year. During this dry season, all animals desperately sought water. It was crucial not to urinate in the dense forest, as leopards, craving water, would approach from afar.</p>
<p>From Gonedi Pike to the Indo-Burmese border of Dunzain, and to Jika, the two areas of Surajpur in India had only a few water sources within several square miles. Clear water gurgled out from deep mountain valleys hundreds or even miles away from the positions. This water had to be divided among the units, and the amount used each day was fixed. In the battle near the Poshi White fortress, which reached an altitude of 8,000 feet, the battle lines were drawn around the water source for several days. The enemy took water during the day, while we took water at night, taking turns using the same water source. A sign was written on the steep slope saying, "A beauty is not far from here." Several comrades sacrificed themselves for transporting water and searching for water sources.</p>
<p>Grass</p>
<p>Grass is not food, but it can be eaten. Crossing three mountains also makes it taste good. Grass leaves and tree bark, these forest vegetables, are common knowledge on the front lines. The nature of trees and the types of green grass have turned the soldiers on the Indian front into botanists.</p>
<p>Moon</p>
<p>The moon is bright, illuminating the mountain peaks and streams. Half of the month is illuminated by the bright moon. On moonlit nights, enemy bombers attacked precisely on schedule. Even the commander of the rapidly advancing Japanese northern unit said to his soldiers, "How comfortable is the dark night!" So they marched in the dark. The moon, how unfavorable it is to the transport units! The moon, the shadow of surprise troops, the moon, the benchmark of all operations, gives light to the front lines, but no matter how beautiful the moon is, in the Indian operations, it will change its face, not only having no effect but hindering progress.</p>
<p>Wild Beasts</p>
<p>On the way to India, elephants, horses, oxcarts, wild goats, and dogs participated in the teams. Each animal had its own task. The labor of elephants never exceeded four hours a day, and they were left in the dense forest for the remaining twenty hours to eat a hundred bananas. But when they worked, they could carry 120 kilograms of weight at a time and travel twenty miles. The elephant herds dragging artillery and transporting luggage, and the ox teams, unfazed by the bursting shells, were often used for transport and food, crossing the dense forest with the Japanese army and entering India.</p>
<p>This topic of the animal front extends to the wild beasts living on the Indo-Burmese border. Sentries or advancing units often encountered tigers or leopards. Some units hunted elephant calves and ate their meat, while others dared not eat it. Moreover, where people gathered, crows gathered. As the saying goes, "Where crows gather, the enemy is there." This was even more convincing here. In the Indian battlefield, the enemy was also used by us. (Translated by Hong from the Asahi Shimbun, April 15th.)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Enemy Wooden Aircraft Over Burma and India <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The enemy British wooden "Mosquito" aircraft have recently been reported to appear over Burma. This aircraft is the most superior of the British military aircraft, possessing various special features. The British have boasted that it is "the world's fastest bomber. At the same time, it is second to none in any use, whether as a fighter, reconnaissance aircraft, or attack aircraft."</p>
<p>The biggest feature of this aircraft is that almost the entire body is made of wood. Its advantages are: Metal aircraft can be detected by radio wave weapons from two or three hundred kilometers away, but wooden aircraft, when flying, are not subject to the reflection of radio wave weapons, so they are an excellent surprise weapon. When metal resources are not available, wood can be used to replenish them. The manufacturing process is simple, and it can be mass-produced.</p>
<p>The aircraft has a wingspan of 16.51 meters, a total length of 12.43 meters, and a total height of 4.65 meters. The maximum speed is 605 kilometers per hour, and it can carry 900 kilograms of bombs. It can also fly for long periods at an altitude of 10,000 meters. In addition to being used as a bomber, it can also be used as a reconnaissance aircraft or attack aircraft, fully utilizing its characteristics.

<p>— Xin Lu</p>
<p>In the misty drizzle, dusk quietly rushed into the house early. Mr. Pei wiped the lenses of his presbyopic glasses, straightened his hunched back, gently sighed, and buried his head again to read the express letter sent by his second daughter from his hometown today:</p>
<p>Dad:</p>
<p>Counting the days, it's spring, but the weather seems unable to turn around, still so bleak, with a wind blowing sharp and bone-chilling.</p>
<p>Mom still coughs and wheezes all night, sometimes coughing so hard that tears stream down her face, as if she is coughing up her intestines and stomach. Only when she coughs until her whole body is limp, does she regain a breath.</p>
<p>Grandma's body is getting worse and worse. Eating some thin porridge every day is of no use, but she is always worried about Dad, thinking about her older brother and sister-in-law, and remembering her sister. During the day, she still stubbornly supports herself to clean the house, asking me to stand and watch her. So, pretending to smile (but how can this be considered a smile?) she says to me: "Lifang: You have neglected half a year of your studies for Mom, go back to Dad, go back to school to study! Can't I take care of myself?"</p>
<p>Mom wants me to come back, she has realized that she is a candle flickering in the wind, which makes me feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Prices in the countryside have risen two or three times more than at the end of last year, and it seems that the money on hand won't last many days.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei's heart was as heavy as an iron hammer. He didn't finish reading the letter, and tears had already fallen from his lenses. He tasted a true sorrow. He had worked hard for the cause of education for more than thirty years, and in the end, he only ended up with a fragmented family. In thirty years, he had educated countless disciples, but he could not support the education of his own children. Serving society for thirty years, he could not save his dying wife. For the sacred cause of education, he had shed all his blood and sweat for thirty years. But what reward did he get? His virtuous wife, who had accompanied him for twenty-nine years, had to watch helplessly as she was taken away by death because they didn't have the money to stay in a sanatorium or get air injections. His intelligent eldest daughter, Huifang, would also be forced into the vortex of the professional world to support the family. What the family had in abundance was a large group of children who appeared weak due to malnutrition.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei supported his chin with both hands, staring blankly at the dim corner of the house, letting sorrow devour him like a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>"Grandpa! Grandpa!" Yao'er approached his grandfather's knee, calling affectionately.</p>
<p>"Hmm! Good child! Are you home from school? Where's your brother?" Mr. Pei took off his glasses and touched his grandson's cheek.</p>
<p>"Brother is downstairs helping Mom make coal balls, it's fun! Rolling them round and round!" The child's excited words pierced the grandfather's heart. The fate of the third generation was even worse than that of the second generation.</p>
<p>"Dad!" Huifang came from school, with rain on her hair and her single shirt slightly wet, but her spirit was obviously very excited. "Look! This mouse is what I dissected myself in today's biology experiment class at school. The teacher said I have superb dissection skills. None of the small structures of the small animal's internal organs were damaged!" Saying that, she handed her masterpiece, with its limbs nailed to a cardboard, to her father to see.</p>
<p>Much to Huifang's disappointment, her father did not give her any praise, but only moved his lips and forced a kind smile full of fatigue.</p>
<p>Huifang couldn't help but shiver, feeling that the air in the house was a little strange today.</p>
<p>Sure enough, she saw a letter from Lifang from her hometown.</p>
<p>She quickly walked to the desk and woodenly fell into a chair beside her, silently reading the letter.</p>
<p>It had been half a year, and then she remembered the scene of her mother returning to her hometown to recuperate last autumn:</p>
<p>The night before going back, Mom decided to take her younger sister with her.</p>
<p>The next morning was a foggy and overcast day. Huifang, along with her father and brother, saw her off on the boat. Her brother had entrusted the luggage to Ah Rong, a fellow villager who worked as a waiter, in advance. When her mother's swaying figure disappeared into the crowd pushing and shoving into the cabin, Huifang suddenly felt a sense of emptiness, and her eyes blurred. She vaguely saw her mother turning her head back again. She anxiously forced a smile, thinking of this, Huangfang could not help but shed tears again.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei wanted to comfort his daughter, who was immersed in distress, but he couldn't think of a suitable word. In addition, another thing was troubling his mind: Should he tell Huifang? Her cousin had already introduced her to work as a bookkeeper at the ×× Enterprise Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Pei swallowed the words that had already rushed to the tip of his tongue several times. As a father, he seemed that he should not deprive his excellent daughter Huifang of her right to study. Since Huifang entered middle school, she had never paid tuition once. She received scholarships every term. Last year, when he went to Huifang's school, her homeroom teacher, Mr. Zhang, had praised Huifang in person: "This child is very talented and willing to work hard. If the teacher educates her well, she will have a bright future!"</p>
<p>So, Mr. Pei, with sad love, stood up and stroked Huifang's head with a hand full of affection: "Good child, you should have the right to receive education!"</p>
<p>Huifang was trying to understand the origin of her father's words, but she was inadvertently attracted by a piece of paper on the desk:</p>
<p>"Hereby introduce Ms. Pei Huifang to your company to take up a position. Please grant her a suitable position. Sincerely, ×× Enterprise Company, × General Manager ××, Ming Zhengsu"</p>
<p>On the other side was printed the word "Xie Xu."</p>
<p>"Dad: Cousin has been here?" Huifang was bewildered by the unexpected discovery.</p>
<p>"Yes! Your cousin said, this is... an opportunity. Being a bookkeeper is quite busy, but the company supplies food, and you can get more than a thousand yuan a month including allowances," Mr. Pei spat out these words with difficulty. He was afraid of hurting his daughter's heart.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, just tomorrow, do I have to say goodbye to school?" Huifang asked herself this. This unexpected thing grabbed Huifang's heart.</p>
<p>"Is it really so soon that I have to say goodbye to school life?" Huifang asked herself repeatedly, almost in disbelief. She instinctively thought that this was impossible, but in order to reduce her father's burden, wasn't this a real opportunity? What's more, she had mentioned to her father about finding a job herself first.</p>
<p>She raised her head and looked at her old father, and noticed that the wrinkles on her father's face today seemed to be even deeper. Underneath this full head of white hair was a record of how much sadness he had accumulated! Her father taught thirty hours of classes a week and also worked as a tutor in two families, and he couldn't get three thousand yuan a month. Her father was too tired. In order to help her father reduce the burden on the family, she felt that besides agreeing, she was not allowed to have other considerations.</p>
<p>Huifang held back the tears in her eyes, suppressed her emotions, and tried to say in a cheerful tone: "Dad! Then I'll go to contact them tomorrow!"</p>
<p>In fact, her pale face could not hide her sad expression.</p>
<p>"Child! Dad has stifled your talent!" Mr. Pei stroked his daughter's drooping head with trembling hands.</p>
<p>"But I'm still young! If I work for a year or two, when the situation gets better, can't I still have time to study? Besides, studying doesn't necessarily have to be at school, I can study on my own," Huifang could only comfort her father with her confidence in the future.</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. Pei corrected a stack of test papers and, as usual, called the children to sleep peacefully. Perhaps he didn't want to disturb Huifang's troubled thoughts today, so he exceptionally allowed his daughter to continue to ponder at her desk. The house became quiet, with only the sound of the pattering rain and the evening wind playing a tragic song.</p>
<p>Huifang began to caress her beloved schoolbag, inadvertently opening her test papers. She softly breathed a sigh of relief, "Goodbye, my dear partners, from tomorrow, I can't help but leave you and go to a new environment." She silently bid farewell to her books and test papers.</p>
<p>"I should go to work," Huifang thought: "If the company provides meals, the family can reduce one person's expenses. Besides, I can give some money to support the family every month when I get my salary." She thought that she could get a salary of one thousand yuan at the end of the month, which seemed to relieve the tight feeling in her heart a little, and she was planning how to use this one thousand yuan: send half of it to her mother in the countryside for treatment, leave the minimum amount of money, and give the rest to her father. However, she suddenly felt that she was thinking too far ahead, because she was leaving school tomorrow, which was almost unbelievable to her.</p>
<p>So the shadows of school life appeared vividly before Huifang's eyes:</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Friday again, and there will be a debate after class as usual. Every week begins with the academic affairs committee of the class deciding on a topic, and the students will participate on either side, collecting materials separately. During the debate, they each repeatedly extended their arguments, consulted their own opinions, bluntly refuted, and frankly criticized. They often used the laws of contradiction and non-contradiction that they had just learned in logic class. After several red-faced climaxes, they finally found the truth, and then the emotions of both sides returned to unity.</p>
<p>However, at tomorrow's debate, she cannot use the materials she has prepared to argue fiercely with the other side. So, she turned her head uncomfortably and inadvertently saw the dissected mouse from today's class.</p>
<p>Biology experiments are really vivid subjects! What's more, her dissection skills are excellent, and everything can be seen clearly under the microscope, allowing them to appreciate the fun of theoretical verification.</p>
<p>But what about geometry? That is the best lesson to train thinking. Layer by layer, you think from the topic, exploring the core from every angle. The solution of difficult problems brings unspeakable happiness.</p>
<p>Due to her strong desire for knowledge, there was almost no subject that she did not love. Therefore, she couldn't help but think of the beautiful sounds of the English teacher reciting poems, which immersed the whole class in a quiet realm. But when the teacher taught Lincoln's speech, their blood boiled.</p>
<p>The history and geography teacher's broad and vivid materials often made them listen with fascination, but the teacher often suddenly stopped and asked a question, not letting their mouths be too lonely.</p>
<p>Finally, she thought of the Chinese language teacher, who had extremely deep literary attainments. He liked to tell them the learning stories of the world's great writers, telling them to seek knowledge from real life and to practice writing more. Even if it was abdominal pronunciation that did not pass through the throat, it showed a naive beauty and was a voice of justice.</p>
<p>The tension in the classroom did not forget outdoor activities; after class and after meals, they were also active beside the ping-pong table and on the volleyball court.</p>
<p>Spring break is coming soon, and it's their season for expeditions to the suburbs again!</p>
<p>But those vivid scenes that shone before her eyes could not be visited again from tomorrow. Tomorrow she will break into a completely unfamiliar company to do work that she is not familiar with. What she will see every day will no longer be lively young classmates and kind teachers, but she will have to walk into a spacious office under the gilded city sign, tread on the shiny floor, lean over a glowing desk, and waste her life in the clamor of abacuses and telephones, filling endless account books with endless numbers.</p>
<p>The complex thoughts consumed Huifang's heart. She raised her head and breathed a sigh of depression, her eyes falling on a mirror frame on the board wall. She saw her father's photo from his youth, so heroic and handsome! But the ruthless years took away her father's youth. Her father was old, especially in the half year since her mother returned to her hometown, he seemed to have aged even faster. And what about her mother? Because she didn't have the money to treat her tuberculosis properly, she was afraid that she couldn't live much longer. A dark shadow flashed before her eyes, and she couldn't help but shed tears again.</p>
<p>The clock had struck twelve times, and her father called from the next room: "Huifang! Go to sleep! It's getting late."</p>
<p>"Dad! Coming!"</p>
<p>She hurriedly stacked the books that she had messed up while meditating, turned off the lights, stood up, and heard the rain falling harder and the wind blowing so hard that the glass windows were rattling. Far away in the alley, there was another sound of a miserable and sharp beggar. In the tragedy of life, the pace of life is too difficult!</p>
<p>She sighed again and walked into the bedroom.</p>

<p>The daylight is still bright today, why do you keep directing</p>
<p>Those who come to worship place infinite empty hopes</p>
<p>What's different about another day?</p>
<p>Could it be that you can immediately ascend to heaven?</p>

<p>Only that final resting place</p>
<p>Can you escape, and when you go there soon</p>
<p>You still have to bring a full load of old age!</p>
<p>Do you just sigh for dreams like this?</p>
<p>Don't even plant a flower, just rush back to your old home?</p>
<h3 id="e42">Map Explanation <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The location of the second front that the British and Americans will open in Europe is most likely to be in the English Channel area, according to general observers. Regarding the recent bombing by the British and American air forces, the strategy is focused on the Calais area in the north of the area of activity. The German defenses in this area pose the greatest threat to transport operations in the English Channel, and the enemy must destroy them no matter what. From this, it can be seen that the French coast, from Dunkirk in the north to Bolo Niaise and Apuville in the south, that is, the so-called English Channel area, will become a candidate location for invading Europe.</p>
<p>However, the Germans are well prepared for the enemy. They have stationed 700,000 troops along the Atlantic coast from Norway to the French-Italian border, and built strong and impregnable fortresses, ready to give the landing enemy a headache. (Please refer to the article "Focus of the Second Front" in the first section of today's newspaper.)</p>

<p>The highest number of women available for mobilization in various warring countries: the Soviet Union with 53 million people, the United States with 30 million people, Germany with 22 million people, and the United Kingdom with 11 million people. The ratio of the mobilizable population to the total female population: the Soviet Union with 59 percent, the United States with 45 percent, Germany with 62 percent, and the United Kingdom with 40 percent.</p>
<p>The women's employment rate, with voluntary employment and labor patriotic teams, is compared with the mobilizable population. The United Kingdom has reached 100 percent, or 11 million people. Germany is second, accounting for 77 percent, or 38 million people. The United States accounts for 60 percent, or 18 million people. (Translated from Jitsugyo no Nippon, No. 1106)</p>

<p>The All-Shanghai Open Basketball Group A Finals will be held at Zhongqing on the evening of the 10th of this month at 8:30 PM. Members of society are encouraged to donate generously and benefit poor students.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao's charitable act of providing scholarships benefits young students, cultivates talents for the country, and has long been valued by all sectors of society, who jointly support this good cause. Since its inception, it has received enthusiastic support from members of society and the efforts of the Shen Bao staff. The achievements of this effort need not be elaborated on. Recently, the Shen Bao, in view of the flourishing of ball sports, where the audience at each game far exceeds expectations, with unprecedented grand occasions, decided to hold Shen Bao Scholarship Fund football and basketball charity matches. President Chen of the Shen Bao has liaised with all relevant parties, and all parties, considering that this matter concerns public welfare, are happy to accept, so progress has been quite smooth.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Football Charity Match: Invitation to Donghua Overseas Chinese Federation <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>On the football side - contact has been made with the Donghua Overseas Chinese Federation, who has readily agreed, which is commendable. The date of their participation and everything else will be announced later.</p>
<p>On the basketball side - the All-Shanghai Open Basketball League Group A Finals, Zhongbei vs. Renyu, is scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month (Wednesday) at 8:30 PM in the gymnasium of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao. The officials of the Basketball Committee are altruistic and public-spirited, and use the finals as a Shen Bao Scholarship Fund charity match, achieving two things with one stone, which is deeply appreciated by the Basketball Committee's good planning.</p>
<p>Zhongbei and Rensheng, two teams, each with famous players, won the championships of the first and second divisions of the All-Shanghai Open Basketball Group A respectively, and will hold the finals. At that time, it will also be a charity match for the scholarship fund. Ticket prices are bound to be slightly increased. Except that the original price will still be submitted to the Basketball Association from the ticket revenue, and all expenses will be borne by the Shen Bao, all the ticket revenue will be contributed to the scholarship fund. Therefore, the reporter predicts that fans will definitely rush to be the first on that evening, because they can enjoy the ball skills and jointly support a good cause, which is something everyone is happy to do. The reporter would like to express their gratitude to the students who will receive assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Central and Northern Technical Skills are Unparalleled in Shanghai <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The members of the Central and Northern team, with the exception of Chen Xuechong, are all athletes from the North. Their style is distinctly Northern, making them the only Northern team in Shanghai, hence their popularity among the general fans. The most prominent feature is their exceptionally good individual skills, which is undoubtedly a reason for their repeated victories over strong opponents. Furthermore, thanks to the excellent leadership of Wang Zhongtao and Dai Changling, their pre-match and post-match critiques, as well as their on-the-spot adaptability, are all unique. This time, they joined the First Division of the All-Shanghai Open Basketball Tournament and were invincible, with only one game remaining against China United Pharmaceutical. Originally scheduled for the 25th of last month, it was unfortunately canceled due to order issues at the venue, which is a great pity. Now, with China United Pharmaceutical voluntarily relinquishing their rights, Central and Northern have won the championship of the First Division. Here is an introduction to the team:</p>
<p>Wang Zhongtao - Captain of the team, serving as a guard, he is extremely experienced. Remaining calm in the face of big situations is most commendable. However, recently, it seems that his physical condition is not strong enough to support the entire game, which is a disadvantage. Nevertheless, the team relies heavily on Wang's off-court coordination, so he should be considered the central figure of the team.</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong - Very tall and with superb ball skills, he is currently the most popular player among Shanghai fans. The team's offense and defense depend on Zhenzhong alone. His interception of the ball under the basket is almost flawless. The accuracy and agility of his passing are unmatched by other players. And the beauty of his long-range shots is rarely seen in the basketball world. Therefore, Zhenzhong is indeed a darling of the basketball world, and it is not an exaggeration to call him the "King of Basketball."</p>
<p>Shen Yugong - A player in the Chinese World Games, his level is self-evident. His only special feature is his ingenious left-handed corner shot, which appears and disappears unpredictably. The more he is blocked, the more he can achieve unexpected victories, truly a prodigy and the key to the team's scoring.</p>
<p>Chen Xuechong - The only Cantonese player on the Central and Northern team. Xuechong's style is the same as the Northern style. Everything about the former China Star team has sufficiently proved that there is no difference in tactics. Xuechong has ample elasticity, and his high jumping gives him the upper hand in getting the ball under the basket.</p>
<p>Xu Zhaoxiong - Attended the World Games with Yugong, but in recent years, his body has become somewhat overweight, leading to a feeling of being unable to keep up. Observing his skillful passing and resourceful assistance, he still maintains the demeanor of a veteran.</p>
<p>Zhao Yalin - The leader of the former North Star team. Although still young, he is already experienced in everything. Not only is he capable of dealing with the team's players appropriately, but his interpersonal skills are also impeccable. People call him an old soul in a young body. His bravery during combat is like a bold and decisive warrior, completely different from his composed demeanor off the court.</p>
<p>Li Baozhong - A Northern style player who has adapted to the South. He always has a smile on his face while playing, and his moves use softness to overcome strength. However, within that smile and gentleness, he never easily lets his guard down against opponents. Fans call him the "Smiling Tiger," and he deserves the name in the game.</p>
<p>The remaining players, such as Zheng Guichang, a former Fudan star who is as famous as Zhou Dayun, and Pan Jianhua, a pillar of the former Shanghai Bank team, all possess extraordinary ball skills.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Renyu Has Many Tactics, and Players Apply Them Effectively <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Renyu team is led by Tan Xingbo, with the planning assistance of Liang Guogui, a former Shanghai Jiang champion, and Xia Zeren, from the heyday of Chizhi. Additionally, Yu Huanzi is willing to study the game. Whether in offense or defense, the team has considerable methods. At first glance, it may seem like there are no gimmicks, but upon closer inspection, their ability to apply methods is commendable. This time, they joined the Open Basketball Tournament, drawing in the Second Division. Wherever their skills reached, everyone submitted. Especially the final victory over the foreign team, the Monoc, proved that their methods surpassed others and are worth praising. The team has a strong understanding of gaining possession of the ball and never wastes it on unnecessary shots. Therefore, games against this team are mostly close, with fewer points scored. Now, let us introduce the team members:</p>
<p>Yu Huanzi - The instigator of using methods, everything about offense, defense, left, and right, comes from Yu's command. Old Yu is systematic and rarely makes mistakes, and he is respected by his teammates. His shortcoming is that he suffers from slight nearsightedness, which significantly affects his shooting.</p>
<p>Li Zhaohe - Also nearsighted. He wears glasses with a protective cover on the court. The line of sight is not significantly hindered. Li serves as the center, relying on his height and sufficient elasticity, he is very capable of rebounding. His masterpiece is a reverse shot in front of the basket. He has no long-range shooting ability, which is a disadvantage, but it's also one of his strengths.</p>
<p>Lin Weicong - Nicknamed "Little Lin," which shows he is in the prime of his youth. Relying on his abundant energy, he fears nothing. His style is fierce and ruthless, those who face him are crushed. His shooting is inconsistent, so there is no definitive conclusion. In short, Little Lin is undoubtedly a good forward prospect.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Simple Exercise Training Methods (10) (6) <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Tom, translated by a German</p>
<p>Exercise Three</p>
<p>Extend your right arm forward. Hold a dumbbell or stick as if grasping it tightly. Sweep it downwards close to your side, then continue backwards and upwards, and return to the original position, drawing a large circle. Do not bend the elbow joint.</p>
<p>After extending forward five to ten times, repeat the exercise in the opposite direction, i.e., from back to front, drawing a large circle. Do not bend the arm; it is better to twist the whole body at both ankles.</p>
<p>The movement of the left arm (from front to back and from back to front) is the same as that of the right arm. The hand must draw a perfect circle. Imagine a line on the wall in front of you, starting from the floor, then continue backwards and upwards, passing over the ceiling, and returning to the starting point.</p>
<p>Shoulder and Chest: Right arm extends forward, circling (10 times); reverse circling (10 times). Left arm extends forward: circling (10 times); reverse circling (10 times).</p>
<p>Note: For special practice, each arm should circle forward and backward at least twenty times.</p>
<p>Shoulder and Chest Exercise One</p>
<p>Shoulder and Chest Exercise Two</p>
<p>Shoulder and Chest Exercise Three</p>
<p>Ma Canxi - Experienced and reliable, he serves as a guard, relying on his excellent positioning and sharp vision. Thus, he has the advantage of waiting for the enemy's attack and lightly blocking their advance. He is also good at long-range shooting, a standard guard.</p>
<p>Zhuo Guorong - Together with Old Ma, they form a pair of guards, like an iron gate. Zhuo's jumping to grab the ball is marvelous, and his dribbling is extremely skillful with excellent speed. He can occasionally rush into the opponent's basket to assist in the attack, compensating for the team's forwards' lack of shooting. Players like Ji Youkun and Wang Chuqing are all veterans, and replacements are available, making it a well-rounded team in all aspects. (Skinny Reporter)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Table Tennis Should be Promoted Quickly <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Sports in this city have always been highly developed. Since the Shanghai War, various sports have been affected by the war and have been suspended one after another. In the past two years, with the organization of the Municipal Sports Association, various sports have gradually become active. Various ball games have been held one after another. However, table tennis has remained in a slump to this day. The author hopes that the Table Tennis Association will implement its established plan as soon as possible. It is also hoped that people from all walks of life who are enthusiastic about sports will provide practical support so that table tennis can be promoted and developed in the near future, restoring its past enthusiasm.

<h3 id="e50">Tidbits from the Sports Scene <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Miss Shi Ruijuan, a star player of the Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang women's basketball and volleyball teams, became engaged last month to Mr. Lu Peiyuan, an employee of the Siming Bank. Miss Shi has not forgotten about sports. Her progress in both the China Youth basketball and the Western Youth volleyball is increasingly evident.</p>
<p>The Tongren Basketball Team has expanded into the Tongren Sports Association, and it will soon establish a small football team, which will surely make new contributions.</p>
<p>The fact that Fu Zhen followed the Suhuai Football Team on an expedition to serve Donghua, while Fan Qinggong followed the Beixing Team to Shanghai but stayed with the Central and Northern team, are both great stories.</p>
<p>Jia Youliang, the right winger of Donghua, is most beloved by fans, which is certainly due to his excellent ball skills, but also due to Youliang's amiable and approachable manner.</p>
<p>Yan Taowen of the Green Team always has a smile on her face during games, hence the nickname "Sweet Girl."</p>
<p>The Star Basketball Team is organized by people from the Star Perfume Factory. It is said that Miss Zhou Wenji is in charge.</p>
<p>Zhu Tufang is not a member of the Green Team, but is in charge of management. Miss Zhu is enthusiastic about sports and never seems tired. The Green Team owes its current status not only to the team leader, Xie Yiqin, but also to Miss Zhu. (Hu)</p>
