<p>社評</p>
<h3>為警察消費合作社籌借資金有感</h3>
<p>警察消費合作社籌借資金一事，自推動迄今，瞬已兩旬，成績不佳，截至昨日止，共收到墊款一千五百萬元，距離總數一萬萬元目標，不敷尙鉅。一方面，合作社的籌備工作，聞正積極策進，一俟籌備就緖，立需資金運用。在這樣情况之下，對於合作社的成立，自有很大的影響。　　　警察消費合作社設置目的，是在改善警察生活，改善警察生活的目的，是在强化維護治安的力量。凡是居住於上海的人，當然是上海市市民；凡是上海市市民，都希望本身的生命財產得到安寗的保障。尤其是富有者，他們的生命財產更希望得到安寗的保障，足以傑障安寗者一大部分是警察，應負保障安寗的責任者，一大部分也是警察。所以，我們肯定的說，保障市民安寗是警察的責任；而我們更肯定的說，擔負警察的生活，使之克盡保障市民安寗的責任者，是市民的責任。如果再以權利義務平均的計算，那末擔負警察生活的責任，富有者自應比較一般市民要增加。這些論列，認爲是理論固可，認爲是事實也未嘗違背。然而，一般人對於上面論列的，不免有兩種成見：第一，只知保障市民安寗是警察的責任，而擔負警察生活的是政府的責任，與我無涉。第二，只因警察過去在服務方面有種種疵議缺點，抱埋怨態度，不屑語其生活改善與否。誠然，擔負警察的生活，是政的責任。反過來說，政府要求市民協助時而市民不予協助，因此而產生不良的後果，試問還是政府的責任？還是市民的責任？試問還是政府吃虧？還是市民吃虧？這對於抱有第一種成見者不可不辨。誠然，會察過去在服務方面有種種疵議是事實，但是我們要平心靜氣的想一想，警察維持生活困難，爲造成這種事實的原因之一，也是事實。所以，我們要竭力矯正警察的服務道德，同時，我們就要消滅造成其事的原因。況且，最近警寒當局已在認眞革新警察的服務道德。更進一步說，我們先要協助政府澈底改善警察生活，然後我們就督促政府澈底矯正警察的服務。協助政府完成改善警察生活工作者是市民，督促政府矯正警察服務者是市民。實事求是，朋辨是非，我們相信有同樣的市民，必定有同樣的政府，那末，什麼事情還愁不上軌道呢？</p>
<p>所以，警察消費合作社雖則是市政中的一件，而我們却認爲是政府與市民協同一體促進市政的發軔，必須特別重視，雖則經過成績不佳，但我們仍將以不斷的熱忱，呼額市民下決心完成這一工作，不達目的決不中止。</p>
<p>我們對於今次籌集資金成績不佳的原因，認爲有兩種錯誤觀念，第一，對於墊借資金認爲是捐款性質。第一，對於地方治安之嚴重性，未能認識，漠不關心，可是，墊借資金與捐款絕對不同，旣稱「墊借」，當然保證歸還·我們知道市政當局近正力求革新，統籌　立財政基礎，預算在一年以後，必有具體歸還辦法。况且，此次籌借，委由市民福利協會從中接洽，就市民福利協會立塲而論，對於償還墊款，負有連帶責任，必將督促政府定期償還。目前償還辦法未能立即公布者，因市府整個財政未經確定之故。</p>
<p>其次，對於地方治安，未能認識，因而漢不關心，這是最足引爲憂憾者。地方治安問題之重要，我們巳屢言之。民廿六年以後，上海一地，經營商業者普遍獲利，尤以非生產事業獲利更豐，暴發戶此比皆是，痛苦者不過薪水階級。所可惜者，暴發之單，逞一時機會，賺錢太易，於是腦滿腸肥，追求享受。傳聞有某著名商業儲蓄銀行之總經理，對此次警察消費合作社墊借資金一事，竟持反對態度，以爲多此一舉。而其本人生活，非常講究奢華，吃的珍錢，住的高樓，穿的第一等英美貨西裝，辦公餘暇，開了汽車，擁了嬌艷，穿梭於咖啡館之中，十足是英美遺毒的買辦作風。請問在優游享樂之時，能否一念站立街頭的警察生活如何有閑階級，腦海中充塞着自己發財，個人事業發展，自然對於地方公益事業漠不關心，表示反對。又有人爲了兒女訂婚，化費近百萬元鋪張揚厲。還有許多殷富人士，對於墊借資金的請求，置之不理。代表了一部分吝嗇冷血的份子。</p>
<p>可是，熱心公益者也不乏人，譬如經營紗廠等之某實業家，經營菸廠的某殷富，前者不待要求，個人自動認墊十萬元，後者除參加同業認墊外，個人亦另認墊。又如新藥業諸領袖，均踴躍墊借。少數殷富人士，雖未全數認墊，但亦表示贊助。商統會方面，對於合作社配給物品，盡力予以優先設法。凡此熱忱，均足為警察消費合作社成立中的功臣。為社會事業揭露曙光，很為欽佩。　　總而言之，就整個治安立塲而論，對警察消費合作社墊借資金有協助之絕對必要，決不能受少數買辦階級的吝嗇而功虧一簣。如果由同業公會以　認墊借方式，藉詞推　，我們主張各別的以公司等商業軍位為目標，要求墊借，或向銀行個別透支，一面決定價還遷辦法，申告墊戶。</p>
<p>我們認為站在人民立塲，對於政治觀念，容有不同，是另一部題；對於；家觀念的的無。又是另一問題可是，對於地方觀念，地主責任，則不能不有。如果其人並地方觀念而無之，尤其是有社會地們者，則其所有之政治觀念，國家觀念，必然是侈談的假面具而已。猶之見媳不予翁姑跑餐的逆待，而逢人侈談孝順之道，同樣的假面具而已。</p>
<h3>日軍突入茲普薩竟夜展開白刃戰　加拉頓戰事將隨雨季告終</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　印度前綫日軍某基地訊，哥希馬西北五公里爲台穌馬之敵砲兵隊，因不堪日軍猛攻，於十三日黎明棄械向哥希馬西北八公里之茲普壓力面潰走，頃已與茲普薩西南方擁有山砲約二士門，重迫擊砲二十餘門之敵砲兵隊合併，謀於該地作最後一戰，但攻下台蘇馬之日軍精銳，乘勝急追敗敵，於十五日傍晚突入茲普薩，予該地西南方之敵砲兵陣地以重創。敵軍數百名陷入重國，僅賴空輸接濟糧秣彈藥，作執拗之抵抗，刻雙方砲戰甚熾。哥希馬西方蜂巢山高地之殘敵，亦仰賴空輸接濟，盡所有之迫擊砲，重機關槍終日亂放，拚死阻住日軍之前進，現仍繼續抵抗中，該高地一帶正全夜展開白刃戰。</p>
<p>印度前綫某基地十九日中央社電　敵軍繼續向迪馬普爾增厚兵力，每日由西倫方面運抵大批兵員，現在判明敵兵力除有機械化一師外，並用運輸機運來二旅兵力，此項軍隊每日均由卡軍開往前綫，日軍與敵軍之大規模之攻防戰，現已益臻迫切。</p>
<p>印緬國境某地十九日中央社電　隨伊姆法爾盆地戰局之演變，印兵參加國民軍者，日漸激增，因之，英軍更爲狼狽。十四日下午一時有古拉賓中尉若，統率印兵某一部隊，携迫擊砲，輕機關槍，步槍，旋彈筒；無綫電機等投降印國民軍，更與日軍並肩站於最前綫，攻繫英國軍隊，爲完成訓國之獨立，而猛勇邁進，該隊印兵並曾向自己所防守之陣地攻擊。</p>
<p>加拉頓前錢十八日中央社電　加拉頓敵軍，因日印同盟軍突破巴雷特瓦防綫，渡過密河纔續北上，頓感狼狽，乃動員在西非軍後方之旁遮普兵一千人，積極防衛巴雷特瓦，但日印軍各部隊自渡過密河後，士氣益形旺盛，於十六日傍晚，冒雨急攻敵軍，並與北上比河之部隊呼應，加强對巴雷特瓦之進攻態勢，於此加拉頓戰事今已隨雨季之降臨而將吿終結矣。</p>
<h3>泰禁公務員營商統制棉紗布輸出</h3>
<p>盤谷十九日中央社電　自入三月以來，敵機對泰國之騷擾行動，漸吿中止，對盤谷等地之轟炸亦吿中斷，泰政府刻正獎勵疏散都市人口，貯藏應急食糧，而講求空襲時之萬全揹置。更爲謀疏散地帶民生之安定，更在內務部，厚生部之指導下，致力於整頓谷地衛生設備，振興工商業及授予避難民生產等工作。泰國之工商業除華僑經營者外，官營色彩頗爲濃厚，第一流公司之經營人，殆均為高級官吏，其他官吏亦有不少經商者，因是常易發生官吏之紀綱問題，泰國政府有鹽於此，近來已有禁止官吏經商之意，正改正現行官吏經商許可規則，該規則不僅禁止官吏經商，且禁官吏不經政府特別許可擅自辭職轉入商界，且規定有官吏一且辭職經商，則此後不得復入宦途之辦法，此即將見諸實行，泰國之官紀當爲之　正。盤谷市棉紗，棉布價格，自年初步步騰昻，入三月後漲風益熾，塞國政府划正努力對薪俸薄之官吏勞動者及空襲被害者實行衣類之廉價配給，保障其等市塲之動向，物費之消費市塲之動向，物資之消費之統制，三月十七日首照棉花之市價降低三四成，定立棉花最高價格。三十日更公布禁止由盤谷冬布利各地區運出棉制品，於是市價漸低，不過其他物塊交易，十五格蘭姆價二百入十巴茲（泰幣），較三月初上漲四十五巴茲，烟草零售價格竟一躍上漲二十成，泰國經濟界目下以來，即着手推進棉花五年拉產計劃，刻棉花之增產甚有進步，倘日·泰合辦紡機公司開始經營樹立消費體制，則泰國機雜製品之目足目給，將爲期不遠。最近泰國政府更任命內務大臣婆羅姚蒂中將爲紡織促進委員會委員長，以謀增產國產之棉製品，此外，更考慮禁止輸出國產棉花棉紗及政府販賣該項製品之辦法。</p>

<h3>蘇門答臘地區試種臺米成功</h3>
<p>蘇門答臘十九日中央社電　蘇門答臘當局，於去年十二月中旬曾試種台憑米種於此間西海三處地域，一般人士對此次試種之能否成功，極為關懷玆第一次之成績，最折業經判明，台灣米種較當地米種優秀，同時更判明如雨水順利時，則可作第二次之播種，其前途殊堪期待。</p>

<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　據東綫前綫消息：塞伐斯托波爾週圍之激戰，現已達最高潮，東方及東北郊外演成一進一退壯烈之陣地爭奪戰。據德軍當局稱，塞伐斯托波爾市因前年激戰之破壞，雖已成爲不甚堅固之要塞，然於戰略上甚爲重要，故德軍將兵誓死堅守該市。</p>
<h3>羅馬軍事設備　業已撤除　德致代勒拉覆隊</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　海通社訊：德國已採軸心國有所籍口，以續作羅馬，此事已由德政府致愛爾關總理伐勒拉覆函中說明之。伐氏之照會及德方之覆文，已於昨日由德外部公布。愛總理表一示世界天主敎徒對於羅馬之安全發生憂慮，並希望交戰國能採取適當措施，使羅馬得免於雜。德復文中稱令部及給養站設於城中，以免敵機之機作炸城中僅有傷兵醫院及少數德國醫察，城中火車亦僅戴平民，德給養隊及軍隊均不得通過城中，故羅馬實無被炸之必要，此後羅馬所受之一切損失，英美空軍應負其責。德政府期待愛總理通知英美以羅馬解除軍事設備之事件，倘敵人之態度仍不改變，而迫使德指揮部亦改變其態度時，則英美應負責任。</p>

<h3>德軍政界觀察　西歐戰機迫近　偉英美大軍集中待命</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　英美進攻西歐，似將開始蠢動，此不僅在敵方之宜傳中可以窺知，即德報幾全篇揭載關於進攻問題，謂將於下月中開始，同時英美之作戰準備，亦將於彼時完成，寬屬一最適宜時期。開於此點，德方亦予承認，現德軍已使用第一次歐戰時所用之（71）西部戰綫一語，幷聲明西歐最近即將變為第一戰綫。</p>
<p>里斯本十九日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓消息：美國人士以為英國限制外國使節行動，顯示攻歐日期已迫在眉睫。</p>

<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德軍當局宣稱，强大之美轟炸機大編隊于昨午在戰鬥機保護下侵入柏林區，有若干處蒙受損失，尤以拉儈諾爲甚，德防空部隊于困難防空情形中，擊落敵綫四十四架，其中四十架為四引擎之轟炸機。英機于昨晚襲巴黎及波羅的海沿岸地區，其中數架曾長入德西部及柏林，英機被擊落十四架。</p>
<h3>寄重慶知識階級</h3>
<p>— 平野義太郎</p>
<p>滿佈着人跡不到之密林的緬印國境，現在成爲日軍與英美渝軍決戰的戰塲了。富貢區域渝軍歷次的慘敗，更加甚了重慶知識階級的苦悶。</p>
<p>重慶方面今日所視爲生命綫者，是打通細甸公路。蔣介石所焦慮者在此，重慶知識階級所苦閱者亦在此。</p>
<p>每夜輾轉反側所思考者，怎樣用適當的空輪方法從對鎖狀態中取得物資。一部份華盛頓官員對此的態度，亦游移不定。　　中國事變以來，在美國抓住美國人的心理的林語堂，去秋出版一」，第一章是「聲訴」，因爲重慶知識階級所苦悶者，是空中運輸，是萊杜公路，是打通編甸公路，因而林語堂所着的標題，亦是「淚與笑之聞」，對美國泣訴；得意的　刺，不再見之於字裏行間，而如「聲訴」一章所述，緬印渝公路悲劇，造成了知識階級的煩悶。這種苦悶，實就是現在重慶知識階級眞正的「聲訴」</p>
<p>尤其在最近的細印國境戰役中，夢想恢復連接從北部阿盛密經密芝那而出保山的緬甸公絡之萊杜公路，而在萊社，富貢這路一幣裏動的渝軍新編第三十人師第二十二師，在當貢區域被日軍邀擊而不斷與以打擊，是以他們低劣的作戰企國，在日軍精銳之前，成為泡影。以　還緬甸公路，改着空輸方法為唯一倚當的重慶要人及知識階級，由比而愈失望。</p>
<p>最大的不平</p>
<p>如以林語堂爲重慶知識階級的一代表，則今日重慶知識階級所最不滿與不平者，乃是對英國帝國主義：第一，援助重慶的物資，英國並不通知重慶，而在印度被華維爾中途戰取。第二，英國雖然知還細甸公路的切斷，其結果使重慶孤立化，弱體化，但決不防衛重慶。這是因爲英國在根本上從其帝國主義的立塲出發，毋寗這樣來得更爲有利於已。</p>
<p>第三，印度獨立間題象徽着世界各民族的自由獨立問題。英國的態度，是亞洲民族的獨立與自由之關鍵之試金石。然而邱吉爾明白聲稱「大西洋憲章不適用於亞洲」，顯然想保持英帝國主養的舊秩序。　　「英國人爲了自由而奮鬥，但和爲了自由而奮鬥的印度人爭鬥。因爲在這種混亂狀態中，所以在印度的英國人，如其想一本正經的考察這問題，保險中風而倒。（林語堂）　　但現在重慶對日本和英國立在一條戰綫上，且在緬印國境共同作戰的時候，重慶知識階級對英國的這種批判，不用說，完全是無意義的，是思想上的最大矛盾。究竟參加日細印打倒英帝國主義呢？還是奴隸亞洲，成爲帝國主義的屠殺塲，而自其於「擠牛乳的牛之立塲」？重慶祗有在這二條路中擇一而行。</p>
<p>重慶的敗績已很顯然</p>
<p>已經成為日英兩軍決戰塲的緬印作戰，以重工業地帶加爾各答爲中心的孟加拉州，隔阿拉干山而直接日軍的威於危機。在北部細印戰綫蠢動的渝軍，還想打通萊社公路，但終於完全敗退了。日軍完全遮斷了爲自由而戰的印度，和美國軍事勢力下迅趨盎格魯撤克遜殖民地化的重慶之間的聯絡，以謀復與亞洲的新國家緬甸之安全，更進而促進完成自由印度的獨立。</p>
<p>狡獪的英國，不會爲了幫助重慶而着手打開印緬渝公路。在開羅會談已經這樣決定，因此，蔣介石頗不滿意。然而重慶還派遺了約三萬人赴印度，加上前次敗殘部隊，羅學英部下第五第太軍，由美國將校訓練，給與了許多美國的折代武器。不過此次在富貴地區中許多戰車的起火拋鋪而致慘敗，是以預斷特來的失敗。</p>
<p>美國在對日戰略上欲在中國獲得航空基地，所以終想利用重慶，要傾注戰力於中國戰綫，對日空襲，除了空輸以外，沒有別的方法。但無論使用多少大型運輸機，正如美陸軍航空部像司令官安諸特所言，對中國的補充是最大的困難。林語堂等知識階級和宋美齡等要人，向美國訴願解救中國的封鎖狀態，但毫無效果</p>
<h3>孫中山先生的先見</h3>
<p>東亞諸民族的解放，亞洲獨立國家的復與，乃在互相尊重自主獨立，昻揚東方的鄉土文化，謀經濟的繁榮，撒廢盎絡魯撒克遜式之人化。如林語堂等重慶的知識份子也說出了「亞洲的勃與」，這是一個進步。不過「亞洲的勃與，是帝國主義的告終」，接受英美帝國主義援助的重慶知識階級，而能够見動這一點，這復是越過了「淚與笑之間」的笑了。</p>
<p>況且今日重慶政權供給美國空軍基地，軍慶政權本身不啻以亞洲的鄉土出賣給美國，遠反亞洲諸民族（包括印度）自主獨立規睦的要求，中國侭管不屑成爲半殖民地，但成爲美國之軍事的殖民地，結果，就是歸於美國之軍事支配下的意義。這樣下表，要想中國自主獨立，眞是夢想。林語語堂說：</p>
<p>「中國將不再追隨自負的英美，而尋求別的友邦，盟邦。」</p>
<p>這是對美國極憎厭的話，有遠見的中國導師孫中山先生，早就主張以中日爲軸心的大亞洲主養，提倡中日攻守同盟，且强調美國應復麟於門羅主義。（中國存亡問題）　　　在緬印北部戰綫澈底的殲減英美渝軍，在政浩上，田想上，對印度及重慶都有極重大的影響。（作者係大東亞戰爭調查會委員）（翔：譯自四月二日西部每日新聞）</p>

<h3>棉製品配給事務　劃歸棉統會　商統會解釋事權範圍</h3>
<p>關於棉製品配給事務，劃歸棉花統制委員會統籌辦理，並改名爲棉藥統制委員會，案經商統會呈奉行政院令准照辦，詳情巳誌前報。頃據記者探悉。棉花統制委員會，以本案有關該會基本組織及職範國之變更，特函諸商統會認爲事織，聞商統會已明白指示，凡關於棉紗棉布之收買存量及其配給事務，均在移交之列，現在收貢事務，芷在趕辦結束，凡已檢收完畢之紗布先行移交，隨後陸續檢收，陸續移交，至完全結東爲止，並非紙限於配給及撿收巳畢之部份。此外凡由花而紗，由紗而布，由紗布而棉雜品，自原料至最後製品爲止，所有生產加工配給等管理事項，認爲必須通盤奪觀，一震統制，始克奏效，故其整個寨權，均龐答併移歸棉統會辦理。上項各點，商統會已分別呈報行政院備案，並函復棉統會查照。又聞棉羣管理處近正準備辦理移交手續。</p>
<h3>物資券採購米穀　展延至五月終　米統會繼續實行</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會爲獎勵農民繳出米殺，以期順和展開採購工作起見，前會規定凡在本年三月廿三日至四月十日期間內，繳出之米糧，除按價付值外，并另行搭配物資三成，（白券一張半）以公定價格配給農民，以示獎勵，自經實施以來，採購業務成績甚佳，該會有鑒於此，決織續實行，搭配三成物資辦法，現已決定延長至五月卅一日。由最近各採米區收進成績觀之，滬市民貪當可無處匱乏，幷聞該會對於口訂成單，迄今粒米未繳之採辦商，已在考慮施以嚴屬懲處之方法。</p>
<h3>市區卅八期口米　明日起普售</h3>
<p>關於本市封鎖綫內各區除一區外，第三十八期計口授糧，業經市糧食局核定，侮人不拘年齡，得憑該期米票購米二升，售價仍爲十一元五角，並無變更，定明日起各該區內普邊發售。</p>
<p>本市滬西併入區口糧配給，茲於市糧食局辦理至三十三期時，以各政劇分關係，乃改由第一區公署經濟處管理。茲據記者向關係方面探悉：當時糧食調整當局，早將該期食米撥交一區經濟處，於第六十三期口米發售時，同時配於西區各市民，而迄於目前爲止，該期口米竟查無音訊，一殺居民，盼一經濟處能予補發，以雜民食。</p>
<h3>四期特分配給　日內可開始</h3>
<p>上海區粉麥統配處，自展開粉麥統一配給工作以來，推進成績異常頓利，全市各區戶口粉均能按期發配，至於市區切緬業等十業同鬱公會會員商號所籌之特種配給粉，第一第二第三期配給亦已分期實行，經該處逐次改進後，過云間有流弊之嫌者，已嚴予取締，時粉配給工等（罐頭業公會險外）九十萊同業公會會員，向該處籌款領證，憑證向指定零配慮領粉，此次每一會員商號規定配粉一律爲七包，一等粉五包，三等粉二包，聞此次特種粉配給，該處決派員前往各零配盟視領配，以防流弊。</p>
<h3>商統會代表大會　決改期舉行</h3>
<p>全國商業統制總會會員代表大會第二次籌備曾議，原定昨（十九）日舉行，因準備未及，決定改期舉行。</p>
<h3>三十三期捲烟依照新價配給</h3>
<p>華中烟草配給組合，自經當局稷准改訂攜烟公定價格後，關於第三十三期派貨，黨京通知繳款提貨。完全依照新復發配，小賣商之利潤仍爲百分之二十，計丁級貨值八千餘元，以一二四八制分配，但所派之貨反校上次減少，聞有若干小賣商因無利可圖，竟中止繳款。</p>
<h3>理髮匠　應帶口罩</h3>
<p>防止腦膜炎</p>
<p>流行月餘之腦膜炎，一因天時關係，至今仍形猖獗，查此症病菌，除病人外，大都由染帶病菌而本身並不息病之人所敵播，因其表面一無病狀，常人不知趨避，故其爲害之烈，甚於病人。第一區公署衛生處對於此定，除已積極採取各種有效措置外，並由區署頒發佈告，醫告公共塲所主管人員注意通氣設備，並禁止兒童進入娛樂塲所，最近該處鑒於理髪匠與顧客間，極有相互傅染之可能，故已督飭範察員分往各理髮店，　切　論理髮匠佩帶堯密之口軍，開關後凡查有故事運定章者，當于嚴懲。</p>
<h3>音樂演奏　茅愛立女士獨唱會</h3>
<p>「聲樂」就是「歌唱」談到女聲樂人才，郎統秀女士是爲人稱這的，但在華北方面，茅愛立女士却也佔重要地位。茅女士是歌王蘇士林的弟子，在受學於蘇氏之節，曾在燕京大舉專門研究音樂三年，北京，天津，靑島各地每年舉行爾度獨唱會，始的優點是能把唱辭和歌意同時表演。所以茅愛立女士的歌唱，有如觀歌劇般的易於際解，對音樂感與趣者能够欣賞，即不知樂理者也能了解。此次在上海舉行個人獨唱會，聞二上海管紋業隊伴賣。</p>
<p>又靑年小提羣名手馬思宏領導之室內樂演奏會，將於本月十四日（星期一）下午五時半，假座開心大戲院舉行，全部節目均爲法國近代作品，計福萊之小提琴朔拿大，路易埃之大提奪塑拿大，舍克萊丹夫人之鋼奪及克勞莢克夫人之獨唱等，尤以馬思宏君技紹，爲好樂者所愛賞。</p>
<h3>清除南市垃圾義演成績甚佳</h3>
<p>滬南市民福利協會爲淸除南市全區垃圾起見，得全市各名伶之協力，昨日假座天蟾舞毫舉行義演，結果共得票款約卅萬元左右，該款由南市各公團一組織保管委員會保管。</p>
<h3>西區銀行聯誼會　舉行座談會</h3>
<p>上海西區銀行同業聯誼會，於前日假座海格路純應，舉行春季座談會並遊國聚餐，計到西區各銀行經理虞成·丁安治·席元助·任元字·王萃耕·洪革樓·洪聘良·統義民·李報年·王開平·方安之·趙耀章·吳仲甫·陳贊民·王　道·秦友誼等四十餘人，餐後舉行座談會，請經濟舉家李權時演認戰後之經濟，李氏將美國南北戰爭後及第一次界之借鏡。商法專家王效文演議票據習償法　疑，將票據背審實任問飚，作一肯定之解德，聽者均感與實，至下午五時散會。</p>
<p>來函　遇啓者，本日靑報載：次長孔憲　氏蒞滬澈查后胡在滬財產等語，畫司法行政部次長兼任本處處長，此次孔次長由京來滬，係處理本處事務，非爲激紊后胡財產，誠恐以訛傳訛，用特函達，即希畫照更正爲荷。司壯行政部駐滬辦事處啓四月十九日。</p>
<h3>北星籃球隊　昨敗於西青　日全隊離滬赴常</h3>
<p>華北北星籃球隊，前晚戰勝西靑嚴後，昨晚又作策二次賽，北星先盛後表，不幸以三十一比三十入受挫，上半時北星以十五比十四佔先一分。北星上塲聲勢甚佳，層議六比〇，入比一領前，　陣法漸見淩亂，終為西青超出·北星定明日離滬北返，先赴常州比賽二塲，再赴無錫後北返。</p>
<h3>各項配給物資　未能如期授配　市民盼當局調整機構</h3>
<p>關於本市第一區方面之戶口米，過云每期鉤能按期授配，惟自上月下旬迄今，對於第六十七期戶口米，何日授配，未有確期，此次戶口米竟一再脫期，達二期之久，遂致引起黑市米價之狂漲，蓋一般市民以侮旬配米二升，已感不足維持，此次又復一再脫期，爲安定民生計，主特糧食當局，亟宜從速督促授配。又本市一般市民，報盼當局應即調整配給機構，因市民現有之火柴，肥皂，油，黑守配給證，均未能如期實施配給，以致各項配給物費之黑市價格，日形高漲，一般民衆，受此打擊，莫不深以爲苦。</p>
<h3>伊姆法爾英軍　陷入重圍中　日陸軍報道部發言人談</h3>
<p>日駐華上海陸軍部報道部發言人，昨日下午二時，在循例報道常會席上，會見本市中國新聞記者時，發表伊姆法爾大殲減戰之特異性。發言人首謂：在軍事上政治上，具有極天意義之日印軍駢肩發勸之伊姆法雨爾大殲滅戰。在日本以巧妙之戰略與週密之準備，推進極爲順利，確信定可獲得驚人之大戰果。</p>
<p>伊姆法爾包圍形勢</p>
<p>旋解釋伊姆法雨之包圍形勢及寶際狀況，以伊姆法爾爲中心，分下述數點：　北部方面刻已推進在伊姆法爾五公里之聖瑪伊地區，此綫距離伊姆法爾最爲接近，是以激戰頗烈。　東北都方面已推進至伊姆法爾七公里之唐密卡地區，　東南部方面，在伊海法爾東南約二十公里之巴列爾戰綫，刻日軍對此堅强鞏固之要塞敵主力部隊，繼續予以戰減激戰中。　南部方面在洛克塔湖與草洛丘林間之隱路舉新波爾（位於伊姆法爾南方十八公星）之作戰，另一部　從莫洛　林西方進攻，業已佔領該丘林之最高地，故伊姆法爾平原已可瞭如指掌。關於畢新波爾之敵軍，以英洛丘林之被偵領，不能取得聯絡而被切斷，一部份正向　姆法爾敗竄，另一部則企圖向希雨卻方面敗靈，但因被日航空部隊，早將嫩巴東方之大鐵橋加以炸殺，退路亦遠日軍切斷，而西方地區在接連天險之山岳地帶，成爲一天然之障碍，蓋唯一退路本爲嫩巴鐵橋，已遭作皺，故已成爲窺中之鼈，被困重圍之敵軍，則已靜待被殲，敵軍計有第四軍部下之十七師，二十師，二十三師，暨機城化旅團等，該軍等被日軍猛烈之攻擊，凌亂不堪，現佔計僅二十三師與機械化旅團，尚能保持兵力，在重圍中之敵單總數約計十萬人左右。</p>
<p>政治軍事上特異性</p>
<p>關於伊姆法爾之攻略戰特異性，在政治上曾，即已確立自由印度獨立政府之政治上與軍事上之地位，在軍事上言則重重困國之敵軍，將全被殲滅，決不留存一兵，故突入伊姆法雨一點，在目前情勢之下觀測，頗爲易舉，於客觀上而言之，或爲人深覺尚　遲慢，而在此地區進擊之特異性，凡欲零取數方之重要根據地，其目的乃在殲減敵方之兵力，首先準備充分戰備，採取包圍形勢之各軍，均須取得聯絡，並聯合加以總攻擊，須絕不容敵被逃一名。目前在伊姆法塑之狀況，即在此一階段，以舉一有力之例而言，四月上甸。德蘇戰區在泰爾諾渡爾及科洛歇地區，蘇齊柯夫部下之第一烏克藥方面軍，曾將約有五師之德軍加以包圍，當時適有蘇軍一團急圖建功，魯莽突入重國，遂爲德軍殲減，而此時據軍即乘機突出包圍，得以說險。故日軍當以萬全之準備元成後，始予突入，至伊姆法爾之戰況，目前已值雨季，數軍之平科力量與機械化部險之力量，逐漸遭受困雜，而日印軍之進攻，得可充分活動，敵雜以阻碍，故日軍進攻，極爲順利，因此伊姆法爾之危機，在英美渝方面恐慌頗甚，且情緒不安，此次抨擊蒙特巴頓可爲一例。</p>
<p>蒙特巴頓狼狽不堪</p>
<p>關於蒙特巴頓東南亞洲聯合軍司令部，終於在本月十六日由新德里遷云錫蘭島，此足見蒙特巴頓之不利，狼狽遷移司令部址。此外渝在渝一般華人之動向，對「抗戰」前途頗爲悲觀，三月份較二月份增多二倍，而樂觀者則又滅低二份之一，主張「抗戰」者較二月減少六份之一，希望和平者已增加十分之一，在三月聞渝方發生變化之原因，由於「反攻」緬甸之失敗，放奮生此項變化，在渝治下之民衆，極度失望表現，乃不容疑間。</p>

<h3>上海體育會　捐助防空經費</h3>
<p>據上海特別市市民防空本部發表：上海體育會昨向該部攜助國幣二十萬元。　充防空措置經費。</p>
<p>昨日夜報時聞六點五十分</p>
<h3>愼母舍本遂末</h3>
<p>何以頗之舍本逐未？一般富商豪賈動輒以鉅額金錢演費於個人拿樂之私人俱樂部，甚至偃用私人保　以策安全，而獨吝於捐助社會福利事業，甚至與公共治安有聯專業，有如嚴近舉辦之響察淸費合作社運動，就是會本逐末的一個備子；一般意志淺總的人們，動　懷抱行險僥倖全義，不惜以其汗血所得的金錢慮鄭叵力求與跑始狗塲一類的公開諸博塲所，而獨昧於「業精於勸而蓋後嬉」的古訓，以及識時範衣觀食之旨，還又是舍本逐未的一個例十。</p>
<p>「人無遠慮，必有近憂」，便是舍本逐未的危險所在。假令生產界紙顧目前的暴利，而不知以生產緩構是否健全爲其考慮，其果必至不能保持其未來生產事業的壽命；假令消費舉祇頗眼前的享架，而不知以戰時的環境與戰事的前程爲其考慮，其結果必至不能保持其未來最低限度的生存。舍本遂未的危險，便長這樣一般。</p>
<p>基於道樣一個觀點，我們願掬至誠奉動經濟界人士以及整個的消費震衆，從今放遠他們的眼光，或則努力於增加生產，或則致力於公共事舉，同時，復須擊力於一切劣根性的鏟除，如是而後戰時的經濟社會，方有澄淸之望。</p>

<h3>籲請舊八區改善　發給「配給證」辦法</h3>
<p>過去第八區發給買米等證，均係根據保甲，例如某日某時發給某聯某保，先期通知，至則按照保甲次第魚貫而入，按薄查發，旣不使有爭先之機，又無須乎久立之苦，法至善也。此次給證，忽改爲按地段排日領取，因之遂與保甲絕緣焉。揆立法原意，或係別有可取。但下民實驗，則其苦有不堪言，願一陳之。</p>
<p>海魯住泰山路，依法應以十七日往，地址則桂林路四八五號。此臼以八時半到述，已陣如長蛇，後至者皆排於瓦礫塲上。露天鵲立，凄風苦雨，困頓不堪，然又無臨時退出之理，則亦忍受之。（其時頗有不應於此日此地領證者亦商從於內，後始退出，可見小民知識，實與當局預期相差甚遠。）返駐步入室已九時三刻矣。先是，凡領證者須於一二月房捐票外，兼附去年十一月捐票呈騐，至此有人未能前知退者又若干人，其人固空勞往返，然亦已妨害餘人矣。室內列長櫃，有標「收受」之窗洞五六，入室者復分組排立。司事者收捐票去，人各給號碼牌一，憑牌再至另一窗口標「給發」者候焉。以發牌之窗多，持牌者均匯於此，且號碼紛岐，遂不復能作雁行，秋序因之大亂。持牌擁窗前者可五四匝，窗內司事，喚某號在理應某號前，但阻於人牆，勢非中央突破不可，而其已近窗口者，未必其號遂出，則亦飽當壓泊之苦。初，列隊廣塲，男女有別，但至持牌換證，遂合爲一。衆人甫從雨中來，泥足互踐，雨具相雜，濕氣與汗臭蒸發爲異味中人欲嘔。余以十時得脾，迨換證出，已十一時許，上午遂不復能洽他事矣。</p>
<p>身經此役，頗有不能已於曾者。保甲制度，引其綱，萬目張，引其紀萬目起者也，棄保甲而用分地制，竊爲不取看一。雨淋日晒，中人之家無傭僕可使，主婦何能堪此？且來此泰半輿臺臧獲學之流，類多毫無知識，如何不使中人之下視爲畏途此其二。國人讀碍重氣節者古有不食「嗟來」，今則其辱有甚於「嗟來」，而其「食」則非可以不費而得也，如何尊重「民格」此其三。立法務在個」，範在上者思所以改善之，則莫不額手歌誦矣。（却酬）</p>
<h3>世界紅卐字會　施送防疫藥品</h3>
<p>近以天氣漸趨暖和，疫瘋日盛，而藥價高昻，一般貧病，實無力担負，世界紅卐字會，胞與爲懷，虔製各種靈丹。昨送來本處普濟丹（四季均司服甩）一千服，雷擊散，霹霧散（此一種量合腦膜炎用）各五十服，天中茶（時疫可用）一百服，共一千二百服，以備貧病面索，仁風可感，謹代受惠者深致謝意</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋驛</p>
<p>第二天平晨全體起床後，接戰一紙「全體候補在則方艦橋集合」的命令。</p>
<p>眞人等不知道是什麼事情，跑上艦權時，自己的眼睛已經能看兌了去向的左方，在在紫紅色的朝霞裏。現出一個龐大的烏影來。</p>
<p>「那就是金銅石碑……」把着雙簡望遠鏡窺看中的敎官這樣脫。</p>
<p>稱作檀香山的楔島，眞有點奇怪，而與海港連綿不斷的山脈，好像是一片稍微破損了的磚瓦一樣橫擺着。旣然看見了這個，心中業杏已覺得來到檀香山了。阿胡島在艦的左方逐漸大起來。</p>
<p>「是並不十分令人可愛的山！」</p>
<p>「你瞧，是隱藏着砲台的山……」</p>
<p>金鋼石岬的名聲，並不見得十分大，但眞珠灣一帶的重疊層見的花紅草綠的翠暫，的確非常藥慶，而令人依然不捨。</p>
<p>（喂，好像是在什麼地方看見過的精緻。）</p>
<p>眞人在心中這樣想。思索了片刻，終於想到了。那是在二中讀書的時代，到大隅去，或是到付麼一個地方去－－總而當之，是在船上，回鹿兒島的歸途上，所看到的遠眺景緻，頗有點相像夕但只波浪的頹色，是決然不同的。此處的海，像三色版的畫片一樣，有充分鮮明的綠色。正像翳翠放在玻璃水瓶中的水色一樣。</p>
<p>眞人低頭凝視着海水，看見海裹有黑影似的東西來回鑽游着。</p>
<p>「喂，那是什麼？」候補生中的一個人，也注意到了那些東西，而大聲喊呌出來。</p>
<p>「是鯊魚。此處海裹有很多。」Ｅ中尉這樣告訴了。</p>
<p>不久候補生們下到艦艙裏去吃早飯，然後換好軍裝，又跑上甲板，這時候爲了迎接領港（Pilot），所以本艦完全降低了速度開駛。這已經到了檀香山的港外，金鋼石岬的整個姿態輪廓，全收於眼底。於是在輩舉色的海面上，很多廳托小漁船，小汽艇等，都那怯地駢來。</p>
<p>「看哪！那是日本僑民的歡邊船。」Ｅ中尉這樣說。</p>
<p>「那末，方才的鯊魚是否也是來歡迎的呢？」大家都在談笑中的時候，小船的形影就逐漸大起來。無論那隻船上，都是擁擠着，而滿滿地載着人。其中有拚命揮動着巴那馬草帽的男人。其中也有柔和地，飄飄地搖　着浴衣袖，而用手歡呼的女人。須臾間，震撼天地的「萬歲，萬歲」歡呼聲，也衡入耳鼓裹來。艦上的人們也揮動着手，表示答體。所有的船隻上，都掛着大小的太陽旗和美國花旗。Ｒ大尉看見這種情形，好像不明白似地說：</p>
<p>「和我往年遠航時正相反，此次，美國花旗反比太陽旗大了。」</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>在禮砲隆隆聲中，悄悄地進人壇香山港，從外貌來着，實在出乎意外，看着非常貧弱。發龍的亞羅哈塔，原來是並不特別的一個鐘聲。戶口比神戶還少，而葱　的綠樹，籠罩着全市。然而注意一看，與其設貧弱，倒莫如說滿洒更爲治當。並沒有大都會那樣的氣勢凌人，而具有典型海濱都市的五顏六色，以及明期的霧圍，愈逼近獨頭，而像自己也愈溶化到裹面了。在一片綠蔭發中，宏壯的樓舍，零散地聳入雲霄，而各自高高地飄揚着花旗。</p>
<p>「眞有點異國風味！」</p>
<p>排立在甲板上的眞人等，心中這樣想。　　海水似乎很深，兩艘軍艦就橫靠在庫綫林立的岩壁傍。岩壁的上面，滿都是汽車，人羣，小型國旗。遙遠地望過去，似乎全是外國人，然而其實，無一不是日本人。這樣人山人海，竟出意外地是臼本人這樣多。甚至穿着日本和服的人，拖着木屐的女人，也可在人羣中看得見。</p>
<p>「萬歲！萬歲！」</p>
<p>人羣裹，像唱神戲樣的舞蹈，而揮動着手腳的也有。</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Raising Funds for the Police Cooperative</h3>
<p>The fundraising for the police cooperative has been underway for two weeks, and the results have been unsatisfactory. As of yesterday, only 15 million yuan has been received in advances, a significant shortfall from the 100 million yuan target. Meanwhile, preparations for the cooperative are reportedly progressing actively, and funds will be needed as soon as preparations are complete. Under these circumstances, the establishment of the cooperative will be greatly affected.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the police cooperative is to improve the lives of the police, and the purpose of improving the lives of the police is to strengthen the forces maintaining public order. Everyone who lives in Shanghai is naturally a citizen of Shanghai; and every citizen of Shanghai hopes that their lives and property will be protected. In particular, the wealthy hope that their lives and property will be secured. The police are largely responsible for ensuring this security, and they bear a large part of the responsibility for maintaining public order. Therefore, we can confidently say that protecting the safety of citizens is the responsibility of the police; and we can even more confidently say that supporting the lives of the police, enabling them to fulfill their responsibility of protecting the safety of citizens, is the responsibility of the citizens. If we further calculate based on the equality of rights and obligations, then the wealthy should bear a greater responsibility for supporting the lives of the police than the average citizen. These arguments may be considered theoretically sound, and they are not necessarily inconsistent with reality. However, the general public inevitably has two preconceived notions about the above arguments: first, they only know that protecting the safety of citizens is the responsibility of the police, and that supporting the lives of the police is the responsibility of the government, which has nothing to do with them. Second, they harbor resentment due to various past flaws and shortcomings in the police service, and they disdain to discuss whether or not their lives should be improved. Indeed, it is the government's responsibility to support the lives of the police. Conversely, if the government asks for the assistance of citizens and the citizens do not provide it, resulting in adverse consequences, whose responsibility is it? Is it the government that suffers, or the citizens? This must be clarified for those who hold the first preconceived notion. Indeed, it is a fact that the police have had various flaws in their service in the past, but we must calmly consider that the difficulty the police have in maintaining their livelihoods is one of the reasons for this fact, and that is also a fact. Therefore, we must do our best to correct the service ethics of the police, and at the same time, we must eliminate the causes of the problem. Moreover, the police authorities have recently been seriously reforming the service ethics of the police. Furthermore, we must first assist the government in thoroughly improving the lives of the police, and then we will urge the government to thoroughly correct the service of the police. It is the citizens who assist the government in completing the work of improving the lives of the police, and it is the citizens who urge the government to correct the service of the police. Being realistic, distinguishing right from wrong, we believe that if there are the same citizens, there will definitely be the same government, so what is there to worry about not getting things on the right track?</p>
<p>Therefore, although the police cooperative is only one item in municipal administration, we believe that it is the beginning of the government and citizens working together to promote municipal administration, and it must be given special attention. Although the results have been unsatisfactory, we will continue to call on citizens with unwavering enthusiasm to be determined to complete this work, and we will not stop until we achieve our goal.</p>
<p>We believe that there are two misconceptions that account for the poor results of this fundraising. First, they consider the advance of funds to be a donation. Second, they fail to recognize the seriousness of local security and are indifferent. However, the advance of funds is absolutely different from a donation. Since it is called an "advance," it is of course guaranteed to be repaid. We know that the municipal authorities are currently striving for reform, unifying and establishing a financial foundation, and there will definitely be concrete repayment measures in the budget after one year. Moreover, this fundraising is entrusted to the Civil Welfare Association for liaison. From the standpoint of the Civil Welfare Association, it bears joint responsibility for the repayment of the advances and will definitely urge the government to repay them on time. The reason why the repayment method cannot be announced immediately is that the overall finances of the municipal government have not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Secondly, the failure to recognize the importance of local security, and thus indifference, is the most regrettable. We have repeatedly stated the importance of local security. After 1937, businesses in Shanghai generally profited, especially non-production businesses, and nouveau riche were everywhere, while only the salaried class suffered. Unfortunately, they seized a temporary opportunity and made money too easily, so they became complacent and pursued enjoyment. It is rumored that the general manager of a certain famous commercial savings bank actually opposed the advance of funds for the police cooperative, believing it was unnecessary. And his own life is very particular and luxurious, eating delicacies, living in high-rise buildings, wearing first-class British and American Western suits, and in his spare time, driving a car, embracing beautiful women, and shuttling through cafes, a complete comprador style of the British and American legacy. I ask, when enjoying leisurely pleasures, can one think about how the police standing on the street live? The minds of the leisure class are filled with their own wealth and the development of their personal careers, so they are naturally indifferent to local public welfare undertakings and express their opposition. Others spend nearly one million yuan on extravagant engagements for their children. There are also many wealthy people who ignore requests for advances of funds. This represents a group of stingy and cold-blooded individuals.</p>
<p>However, there is no shortage of people who are enthusiastic about public welfare. For example, a certain industrialist who runs a yarn factory and a certain wealthy person who runs a tobacco factory, the former automatically recognized an advance of 100,000 yuan without being asked, and the latter, in addition to participating in the joint advance of the industry, also recognized an advance separately. In addition, the leaders of the new pharmaceutical industry have enthusiastically advanced loans. A small number of wealthy people, although not fully subscribing, have also expressed their support. The Chamber of Commerce has done its best to give priority to the cooperative in the distribution of goods. All this enthusiasm is enough to make them meritorious in the establishment of the police cooperative. They have revealed a glimmer of hope for social undertakings, and we greatly admire them. In short, from the standpoint of overall security, there is an absolute necessity to assist the police cooperative in advancing funds, and we must not allow the stinginess of a few comprador classes to ruin everything. If trade associations use joint subscription as an excuse to shirk responsibility, we advocate targeting individual commercial units such as companies and requiring advances, or individually overdrafting from banks, and at the same time determining the repayment methods and reporting them to the lending households.</p>
<p>We believe that from the standpoint of the people, there may be different political views, which is another issue; there is no such thing as a family view. This is another issue, but regarding local concepts and the responsibilities of landlords, one cannot but have them. If a person has no local concepts, especially those with social status, then all their political views and national concepts must be empty talk and masks. It is like a daughter-in-law who does not serve her parents-in-law but talks about filial piety to others, just a fake mask.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Break Into Zepusa and Engage in All-Night Bayonet Fight; Battle of Kaladan Will End with the Rainy Season</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – A certain Japanese army base on the Indian front reports that the enemy artillery unit at Taisuma, 5 kilometers northwest of Kohima, unable to withstand the fierce Japanese attack, abandoned its weapons at dawn on the 13th and fled to Zepusa, 8 kilometers northwest of Kohima. It has now merged with the enemy artillery unit southwest of Zepusa, which has about 20 mountain guns and more than 20 heavy mortars, intending to fight a final battle there. However, the elite Japanese troops who captured Taisuma took advantage of the victory to pursue the defeated enemy and broke into Zepusa on the evening of the 15th, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy artillery positions southwest of the area. Hundreds of enemy troops were trapped, relying only on air transport to supply food and ammunition, and put up stubborn resistance. The artillery battle between the two sides is fierce. The remnants of the enemy on the Beehive Mountain heights west of Kohima, also relying on air transport for supplies, fired all their mortars and heavy machine guns all day long, desperately trying to stop the Japanese advance, and are still resisting. All-night bayonet fighting is currently underway in the area around the heights.</p>
<p>A certain base on the Indian front, 19th (Central News Agency) – The enemy continues to reinforce its forces in Dimapur, with large numbers of troops arriving daily from the Shillong area. It is now clear that the enemy's forces include a mechanized division, and two brigades have been transported by transport planes. These troops are sent to the front lines by the British army every day. The large-scale offensive and defensive battle between the Japanese and enemy forces has now become increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>A certain place on the India-Burma border, 19th (Central News Agency) – With the evolution of the battle situation in the Imphal basin, the number of Indian soldiers joining the National Army is increasing day by day, which has made the British army even more embarrassed. At 1:00 p.m. on the 14th, Lieutenant Gurabin and others led a unit of Indian soldiers, carrying mortars, light machine guns, rifles, grenade launchers, and wireless machines, and surrendered to the Indian National Army. They stood shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese army on the front line, attacking British troops, and advancing bravely to complete the independence of India. The Indian troops also attacked the positions they were defending.</p>
<p>Kaladan Front, 18th (Central News Agency) – The enemy troops in Kaladan, after the Japanese-Indian Allied Forces broke through the Barretawa defense line and crossed the Mi River and continued north, felt embarrassed. They mobilized 1,000 Punjab soldiers from the rear of the West African Army to actively defend Barretawa. However, the morale of the various units of the Japanese-Indian army became increasingly strong after crossing the Mi River. On the evening of the 16th, they attacked the enemy troops in the rain and echoed the troops advancing north to the Bhi River, strengthening the offensive posture against Barretawa. The Battle of Kaladan will now come to an end with the arrival of the rainy season.</p>
<h3>Thailand Prohibits Civil Servants from Engaging in Business and Controls the Export of Cotton Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 19th (Central News Agency) – Since March, enemy aircraft harassment of Thailand has gradually ceased, and bombing of Bangkok and other places has also stopped. The Thai government is now encouraging the evacuation of the urban population, storing emergency food supplies, and seeking comprehensive arrangements for air raids. In order to ensure the stability of the people's livelihood in the evacuated areas, under the guidance of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Health and Welfare, they are focusing on rectifying the sanitation facilities in the valley, revitalizing industry and commerce, and providing production work for refugees. Thailand's industry and commerce, in addition to those run by overseas Chinese, have a strong state-owned color. The operators of first-class companies are almost all high-ranking officials, and many other officials are also engaged in business. As a result, problems with the discipline of officials often occur. The Thai government is aware of this and has recently intended to prohibit officials from engaging in business. It is revising the current rules for permitting officials to engage in business. The rules not only prohibit officials from engaging in business, but also prohibit officials from resigning and entering the business world without special government permission, and stipulate that once an official resigns and engages in business, they will not be allowed to re-enter officialdom in the future. This will soon be implemented, and the official discipline in Thailand will be rectified accordingly. Since the beginning of the year, the prices of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Bangkok have been rising steadily. After entering March, the rising trend has become more intense. The Thai government is working hard to implement low-priced clothing rations for officials and laborers with low salaries and air raid victims, to protect their market trends, material consumption, and material control. On March 17, it first reduced the market price of cotton by 30-40% and set a maximum price for cotton. On the 30th, it further announced a ban on the export of cotton products from the Bangkok and Thonburi areas, so the market price gradually decreased. However, the transaction of other goods, 15 grams priced at 210 baht (Thai currency), increased by 45 baht compared with the beginning of March, and the retail price of tobacco soared by 20%. The Thai economic community is now starting to promote a five-year cotton production plan. There has been great progress in increasing cotton production. If the Thai-Japanese joint venture spinning machine company starts operating and establishes a consumption system, then Thailand's cotton products will be self-sufficient in the near future. Recently, the Thai government appointed Lieutenant General Balo Yao Tii, Minister of the Interior, as the Chairman of the Textile Promotion Committee to increase the production of domestically produced cotton products. In addition, it is also considering prohibiting the export of domestically produced cotton and cotton yarn and the government's sale of these products.</p>
<h3>Taiwan's First Batch of Draftees to Serve in the Military Starting in September; Plan Announced by Japanese Government</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government amended the Military Service Law last autumn, deciding to start drafting Taiwanese men for military service from next year. It is now learned that this plan has been officially announced by the Japanese government, and the first phase will be implemented from September 1st of this year.</p>
<h3>Wartime Japan Photo Exhibition Continues</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Wartime Japan Photo Exhibition organized by the Central Telegraph Agency has been open to the public at Xinjiekou since the 16th of this month, and the audience has been very enthusiastic, achieving a good publicity effect. In order to promote the exhibition widely and enable the public to accurately understand the strength of wartime Japan, the agency will move all the photos to the Confucius Temple at 10:00 a.m. on the 20th and continue to exhibit them publicly for three days. The exhibition will be postponed in case of rain.</p>
<h3>Burma Reforms County Administrative Structure</h3>
<p>Yangon, 19th (Central News Agency) – In Burma, the intense fighting on the border and the invasion of enemy aircraft have made the wartime atmosphere increasingly strong. The Burmese government previously decided to establish a wartime system in the country as the goal and reformed the county administrative structure, dividing the country's 34 counties into 15 first-level counties, 15 second-level counties, and 4 third-level counties. In addition to governors, first-level counties will also have deputy governors, and the power to appoint and remove lower-level officials will be transferred to the local authorities, and a system will be established to reward those who cooperate in the war, in an effort to refresh local administration. At the same time, in order to expand the central government, a planning institute affiliated to the cabinet will be created soon, and preparations are underway. The mission of the planning institute is to review important national policies and establish various planning tasks with the participation of experts in various fields in the country and the support of Japanese consultants.</p>
<h3>Commissioner Zhang Goes to Chang'an</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 19th (Central News Agency) – The newly appointed Commissioner Zhang Yuannian, who is also the Special Commissioner for Clearing the Countryside in the Second District of Zhejiang, took the morning train to Chang'an yesterday to assume his new post.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attacking Rabal; 16 Planes Destroyed; US Planes Attacking Hong Kong; One Plane Shot Down</h3>
<p>Rabal, 19th (Central News Agency) – A formation of 218 enemy bombers and fighters attacked Rabal on the 17th. The Japanese garrison shot down 9 of them and destroyed 7 of them. The Japanese side suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 19th (Central News Agency) – On the morning of the 17th, enemy planes attacked Wotje Island in the Marshall Islands multiple times. A medium-sized plane was shot down by the Japanese garrison. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – A four-engine heavy bomber of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing attacked Hong Kong from the east at 1:00 p.m. on the 18th. It was discovered by a Japanese naval fighter on patrol. After a fierce battle, it was shot down in the sea outside the city. A patrol boat in the nearby sea was sent to the crash site and captured the pilot of the plane.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government's Emergency Measures for Decisive Battle; Officials and Civilians Promote Them Together; Personnel Changes in the Ministries of Interior and Health and Welfare</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese government decided on the Outline of 15 Emergency Measures for the Decisive Battle on February 25, it has been gradually working to materialize them, clarifying the direction for officials and civilians to work together under the decisive battle, and is determined to promote the concretization of matters such as the abolition of permits and approvals from central administrative agencies, which are of great epoch-making significance for local administration, and their delegation to local authorities in accordance with the measures. The concrete plan has now been obtained. The cabinet meeting on the 18th discussed the case of "Abolishing Matters such as Permits and Approvals of Central Government Agencies and Delegating them to Local Authorities Based on the Outline of Emergency Measures for the Decisive Battle," and it has been officially decided that the Japanese Information Bureau will jointly announce the following: The delegation to local authorities of the central supervision matters decided this time is based on the principle of "The supervisory matters such as permits and approvals of the central government agencies shall be delegated to the local officials or bureaucrats for a period of one year" shown in the outline. And the abolition this time is based on the事務事業, all abolished temporarily for one year, or for those that need to be preserved, reduced to the minimum outline. Regarding this case, it will be implemented from June 1st. The concrete plan of abolishing matters such as permits and approvals of central administrative agencies and delegating them to local authorities based on the outline, except for the three items of "Expanding the items of prohibited manufactures and unifying standards," "Expediting the裁制檢察," and "Thorough enforcement of信賞必罰and strengthening of查察," has been almost entirely completed. Among the three items that are occupied, the concrete plan of "Expanding the items of prohibited manufactures and unifying standards" will be submitted to the cabinet meeting soon for decision. Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) – In order to promote personnel exchange between the Ministries of Interior and Health and Welfare, the Japanese government decided on the personnel changes at the阅议会on the 18th as follows: Katsuro Aikawa, the governor of Ehime Prefecture, was appointed as the Vice-Minister of Health and Welfare, and at the same time, he was transferred to the Chairman of the Shikoku Regional Council by the order of the Local Administration Association. Zenjiro Karikari, the Director of the Local Bureau of the Ministry of Interior, was appointed as the Governor of Kyoto Prefecture, and Chiyoji Yukizawa, the Governor of Kyoto Prefecture, was appointed as the Governor of Ehime Prefecture.</p>

<h3>Brief Biography of Mr. Tajiri</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Tajiri, the newly appointed minister to the Philippines, is 49 years old this year. After graduating from the Commercial Teacher Training Institute attached to Tokyo Higher Commercial School, he served as a teacher in secondary schools. He then studied in the United Kingdom.

<h3>Javanese Dental Lecturer Enlists in the Army</h3>
<p>Surabaya, 19th (Central News Agency) – The people of Java are extremely brave in protecting their homeland. A dental lecturer at the University of Erta has recently given up his pen and joined the army, participating in the volunteer army. He is a lecturer in the Department of Dentistry at the Surabaya Faculty of Medicine at the University of Erta in Java, and also the director of the Department of Dentistry at the Surabaya State Central Hospital. Before the war, he opened a dental hospital in Surabaya. After the Japanese army arrived, he served in the sanitation team, specializing in taking care of Japanese wounded soldiers and restoring sanitation facilities. Later, he became the director of the Central Hospital's Department of Dentistry and was promoted to lecturer in the Department of Expertise. When the volunteer army was formed in October last year, he resigned from all his positions and engaged in the work of protecting his homeland. According to Mr. Ersmus, many young students have abandoned their studies and joined the army. I cannot sit back and enjoy happiness. We Indonesians should choose meaningful work to complete the Greater East Asia War, especially the intellectual class, who should give full play to their strength and be silent in the war.</p>

The general public is very concerned about whether the trial planting will be successful. The results of the first time have been determined. Taiwanese rice seeds are better than local rice seeds. At the same time, it has been determined that if the rainfall is smooth, a second sowing can be done, and its future is worth looking forward to.</p>
<h3>Carpathian Foothills: German-Hungarian Counteroffensive; Fierce Battle Unfolds in Kholm</h3>
<p>Budapest, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Hungarian military authorities issued a war report on the 18th stating: Hungarian forces conducted a mopping-up operation against Soviet troops in front of the Carpathian Mountains, occupying important areas.

According to German authorities, although the city of Sevastopol has become a less sturdy fortress due to the destruction from the fierce fighting two years ago, it is strategically very important, therefore German soldiers are vowing to defend the city to the death.</p>
<h3>Roman Military Facilities Already Removed; Germany Replies to De Valera</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency reports: Germany has used the pretext of the Axis powers to continue its actions in Rome. This has been explained by the German government in a reply to Irish Prime Minister De Valera. De Valera's note and the German reply were released yesterday by the German Foreign Office. The Irish Prime Minister expressed the concern of Catholics worldwide about the safety of Rome, hoping that the warring nations could take appropriate measures to spare Rome from disaster. The German reply stated that command posts and supply stations were not located in the city to avoid enemy air raids. There were only wounded soldiers' hospitals and a small number of German medical personnel in the city. Trains in the city only carried civilians, and German supply teams and troops were not allowed to pass through the city, therefore there was no need to bomb Rome. The British and American air forces should be held responsible for any future damage suffered by Rome. The German government hoped that the Irish Prime Minister would inform the British and Americans about the removal of military facilities from Rome. If the enemy's attitude does not change and forces the German command to change its attitude, then the British and Americans should bear the responsibility.</p>

<h3>German Political and Military Observations: Western European War Machine Nears; Allied Forces Concentrate and Await Orders</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – The Allied invasion of Western Europe seems to be imminent. This can be seen not only in enemy propaganda, but also in the fact that German newspapers are dedicating entire sections to the invasion issue, saying it will begin next month, and that Allied war preparations will be completed by then, making it the most suitable time. The German side acknowledges this, and the German army is now using the term "Western Front" (71), which was used during the First World War, declaring that Western Europe will soon become the first front.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) – Hutung News Agency, Washington reports: Americans believe that Britain's restrictions on the movement of foreign envoys indicate that the date of the invasion of Europe is imminent.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – A London-based correspondent for the "Yan Budiat" newspaper reports that it has been decided that American newspapers are unanimously reporting that 80,000 tanks have been assembled in southern England, and that over a million American and tens of thousands of British and Commonwealth troops are currently awaiting orders. This news is similar to British Prime Minister Churchill's speech on March 26th, and can be seen as [illegible]. The "Times" newspaper in London also reports that the chairman of the U.S. House Army Committee stated that the army authorities believed that American casualties in the first month of the landing operation would be no less than 150,000.</p>
<p>Issuing Emergency Orders to Facilitate Troop Movement</p>

It was also learned here today that regarding more detailed news about the status of foreign diplomatic personnel in Britain, it is said that diplomatic representatives of all countries will be treated the same as other foreign residents in Britain and will be subject to the same restrictions, and may even be prohibited from leaving their residences under special circumstances.</p>
<p>Shipping Disrupted in the English Channel Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to reports from Berlin: The connecting ships between Cork Harbor in southern Ireland and the mainland of England have been suspended since the 18th.

<h3>US Aircraft Attack Berlin, 44 Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The German military authorities claim that a large formation of powerful U.S. bombers, under fighter protection, invaded the Berlin area yesterday afternoon. Some areas suffered damage, especially Lachenau. German air defense forces shot down 44 enemy aircraft in difficult air defense conditions, 40 of which were four-engine bombers. British aircraft attacked Paris and the Baltic coastal area last night, some of which penetrated into western Germany and Berlin. 14 British aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3>To the Intellectual Class of Chongqing</h3>
<p>– Hirano Yoshitaro</p>
<p>The Burma-India border, covered in impenetrable forests untouched by human feet, has now become the battlefield where Japanese forces are fighting a decisive battle with British, American, and Chongqing troops. The repeated defeats of Chongqing troops in the Fugong area have intensified the distress of the Chongqing intellectual class.</p>
<p>What Chongqing regards as its lifeline today is opening the Burma Road. This is what Chiang Kai-shek is anxious about, and this is what the Chongqing intellectual class is suffering from.</p>
<p>What they think about every night is how to obtain materials from the locked-down state using appropriate air transport methods. The attitude of some Washington officials towards this is also wavering. Since the China Incident, Lin Yutang, who understood the psychology of Americans in the United States, published a [book title] last autumn. The first chapter is "Appeal" because what the Chongqing intellectual class is distressed about is air transport, the Ledo Road, and opening the Burma Road. Therefore, the title of Lin Yutang's book is also "Between Tears and Laughter," appealing to the United States. The triumphant [meaning unclear], no longer seen between the lines, but as described in the "Appeal" chapter, the Burma-India Road tragedy has caused the frustration of the intellectual class. This distress is the real "appeal" of the Chongqing intellectual class today.</p>
<p>Especially in the recent battles on the Burma-India border, the Chongqing troops dreamed of restoring the Ledo Road, which connects Assam in the north to Baoshan via Myitkyina. However, the newly formed 30th Division and 22nd Division of the Chongqing army, which were active in the Ledo and Fugong areas, were constantly attacked by Japanese forces. Therefore, their inferior operational plans became a bubble in front of the elite Japanese army. Those important figures and intellectuals in Chongqing who relied solely on air transport instead of restoring the Burma Road became increasingly disappointed.</p>
<p>The Greatest Injustice</p>
<p>If Lin Yutang is a representative of the Chongqing intellectual class, then what the Chongqing intellectual class is most dissatisfied and resentful about today is British imperialism: First, the British do not notify Chongqing about the materials they are helping Chongqing with. Instead, Wavell intercepts them in India. Second, although the British know that the cut-off of the Burma Road results in Chongqing's isolation and weakening, they will never defend Chongqing. This is because the British fundamentally act from their imperialist standpoint, believing that this is more advantageous to them.</p>
<p>Third, the issue of Indian independence symbolizes the freedom and independence of all nations in the world. Britain's attitude is the touchstone for the freedom and independence of Asian nations. However, Churchill explicitly stated that "the Atlantic Charter does not apply to Asia," clearly wanting to maintain the old order of British imperialism. "The British fight for freedom, but fight against the Indians who fight for freedom. Because in this chaotic state, British people in India, if they want to seriously consider this issue, are guaranteed to have a stroke. (Lin Yutang)</p>
<p>But now, when Chongqing is on the same front as Japan and Britain, and fighting together on the Burma-India border, this criticism of Britain by the Chongqing intellectual class is meaningless and a major contradiction in thought. Should they join Japan in Burma-India to overthrow British imperialism? Or should they enslave Asia and become a slaughterhouse of imperialism, from the standpoint of "a cow that is milked"? Chongqing can only choose one of these two paths.</p>
<p>Chongqing's Defeats Are Obvious</p>
<p>The Burma-India campaign, which has become the battlefield for the decisive battle between British and Japanese forces, with Bengal state, centered on the heavy industry zone of Calcutta, directly threatened by the Japanese across the Arakan Mountains. The Chongqing troops, stirring up trouble on the northern Burma-India front, still want to open up the Ledo Road, but they have finally been completely defeated. The Japanese army completely cuts off the connection between India, which is fighting for freedom, and Chongqing, which is rapidly becoming an Anglo-Saxon colony under American military power, in order to restore the safety of Myanmar, a new nation in Asia, and further promote the completion of a free and independent India.</p>
<p>The cunning British will not help Chongqing by starting to open the India-Burma-Chongqing road. This has already been decided at the Cairo Conference, so Chiang Kai-shek is quite dissatisfied. However, Chongqing still sent about 30,000 troops to India, plus the previous defeated remnants. The 5th and 6th Army under Luo Xueying were trained by American officers and given many American discounted weapons. However, the failure to recover in the Fugong area was due to many tanks catching fire and being abandoned, so the failure was predicted.</p>
<p>The United States wants to obtain air bases in China in its strategy against Japan, so it ultimately wants to use Chongqing to pour its combat power into the Chinese front. There is no other way to launch air strikes against Japan except for air transport. But no matter how many large transport planes are used, as US Army Air Force Commander Andrews said, replenishing China is the greatest difficulty. Lin Yutang and other intellectuals and Soong Mei-ling and other important figures appealed to the United States to lift the blockade of China, but to no avail.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen's Foresight</h3>
<p>The liberation of the nations of East Asia, the restoration of independent countries in Asia, lies in mutual respect for autonomy and independence, promoting the indigenous culture of the Orient, seeking economic prosperity, and abandoning Anglo-Saxon humanization. Like Lin Yutang and other Chongqing intellectuals, they also said "The Rise of Asia," which is progress. However, "the rise of Asia is the end of imperialism." It is a laugh that goes beyond "Between Tears and Laughter" for the Chongqing intellectual class, which receives aid from British and American imperialism, to be able to see this point.</p>
<p>Moreover, today, the Chongqing government provides air bases for the US Air Force, and the Chongqing government itself is selling the homeland of Asia to the United States, which runs counter to the demands of autonomy and independence for all Asian nations (including India). China, even though it disdains becoming a semi-colony, is becoming a military colony of the United States. As a result, it belongs to the significance of American military domination. If this continues, it is truly a dream to want China to be autonomous and independent. Lin Yutang said: "China will no longer follow the conceited British and Americans, but will seek other friendly allies."</p>
<p>This is an extremely resentful statement towards the United States. Sun Yat-sen, the far-sighted Chinese leader, advocated Pan-Asianism with China and Japan as the axis, advocated a Sino-Japanese alliance, and emphasized that the United States should return to the Monroe Doctrine. (The Question of China's Survival) The thorough annihilation of British and American troops on the northern Burma-India front will have a major impact on India and Chongqing in terms of politics and thought.

<h3>Cotton Product Allocation Affairs Assigned to the Cotton Control Committee; Chamber of Commerce Explains the Scope of Authority</h3>
<p>Regarding the allocation of cotton products, it has been assigned to the Cotton Control Committee for overall management, and renamed the Cotton and Medicine Control Committee. The case was submitted to the Chamber of Commerce and approved by the Executive Yuan. Details have been recorded in previous reports. According to reporter inquiries, the Cotton Control Committee believes that this case involves changes to the committee's basic organization and scope of functions. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to confirm the matter. It is heard that the Chamber of Commerce has clearly indicated that all matters relating to the purchase, storage, and allocation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth are to be transferred. The acquisition and contribution tasks are currently being rushed to completion. All yarn and cloth that have been inspected and received will be transferred first, followed by successive inspections and successive transfers until completion. This is not limited to the allocation and collection of completed portions. In addition, all management matters relating to the production, processing, and allocation of goods, from raw materials to final products, from flowers to yarn, from yarn to cloth, and from yarn cloth to cotton miscellaneous goods, are considered essential to be viewed comprehensively and unified under control to achieve success. Therefore, its entire authority has been transferred to the Cotton Control Committee for handling. The above points have been reported to the Executive Yuan by the Chamber of Commerce for record and replied to the Cotton Control Committee for reference. It is also heard that the Cotton Group Management Office is currently preparing to handle the transfer procedures.</p>
<h3>Extension of Material Coupon Purchase of Rice to the End of May; Rice Control Committee Continues to Implement</h3>
<p>In order to encourage farmers to hand over rice and smoothly carry out procurement work, the Rice and Grain Control Committee previously stipulated that rice and grain handed over between March 23rd and April 10th of this year, in addition to being paid at the price, will also be matched with 30% of materials (one and a half white coupons) to be allocated to farmers at fixed prices as an incentive. Since its implementation, the procurement work has achieved excellent results. In view of this, the Committee has decided to continue implementing the method of matching 30% of materials and has now decided to extend it to May 31st. Judging from the recent collection results in various rice procurement areas, Shanghai citizens should not have to worry about food shortages. It is also heard that the Committee is considering imposing severe penalties on procurement merchants who have not yet delivered a single grain of rice for ordered quantities.</p>
<h3>38th Period of Rice Distribution in the Urban Area to Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Regarding the 38th period of rice distribution based on household registration in each district within the sealed lines of the city, with the exception of one district, the Municipal Grain Bureau has approved that each person, regardless of age, can purchase two liters of rice with the rice ticket for that period. The selling price remains at 11.5 yuan and there is no change. The distribution will begin tomorrow in each district.</p>
<p>The ration distribution of the Shanghai West Combined District in this city, when the Municipal Grain Bureau handled it up to the 33rd period, was changed to be managed by the Economic Office of the First District Public Office due to various political reasons. According to reporter inquiries with relevant parties, at that time, the grain adjustment authorities had already allocated the rice for that period to the Economic Office of the First District. It was supposed to be distributed to citizens in the Western District at the same time as the rice for the 63rd period was distributed. However, to date, there is no news of the rice for that period. Residents in that area hope that the Economic Office can reissue it to solve the people's food problem.</p>
<h3>4th Special Distribution to Begin Within Days</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai District Flour and Wheat Unified Distribution Office launched its unified distribution work, the progress has been exceptionally smooth. Household flour in each district of the city can be distributed on time. As for the special distribution flour raised by the members of the Municipal Cutting Noodle Industry and other ten industry guilds, the first, second, and third periods of distribution have also been implemented in stages. After successive improvements by the office, the suspected malpractices that existed in the past have been strictly cracked down on. 90 [illegible] Industry Guild members, except for the Canning Industry Guild, applied to the office for funds and certificates to obtain flour from designated zero-allocation houses with the certificates. This time, each member business is stipulated to be allocated seven bags of flour, five bags of first-class flour and two bags of third-class flour. It is heard that the office will send personnel to each zero-allocation site to supervise the distribution of flour to prevent malpractices.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Representatives of the Chamber of Commerce to be Rescheduled</h3>
<p>The second preparatory meeting for the National Chamber of Commerce Member Representative Assembly, which was originally scheduled to be held yesterday (19th), has been decided to be rescheduled due to incomplete preparation.</p>
<h3>33rd Period of Cigarettes Distributed According to New Prices</h3>
<p>After the authorities approved the revision of the fixed prices of cigarettes by the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association, regarding the allocation of goods for the 33rd period, the party notified the payment and collection of goods. The distribution is entirely in accordance with the new recovery. The profit of small retailers is still 20%, with a total value of more than 8,000 yuan for D-grade goods, distributed according to the 1-2-4-8 system, but the goods allocated are reduced compared to the previous time. It is heard that some small retailers have stopped paying due to the lack of profit.</p>
<h3>Barbers Should Wear Masks to Prevent Meningitis</h3>
<p>The meningitis epidemic, which has been raging for more than a month, is still rampant due to weather conditions. It has been found that the bacteria of this disease, in addition to patients, are mostly spread by people who carry the bacteria but are not sick themselves. Because they have no symptoms on the surface, ordinary people do not know to avoid them, so their harm is greater than that of patients. The Health Department of the First District Public Office, in response to this, in addition to actively taking various effective measures, has also issued a notice from the District Office, medically advising the responsible personnel of public places to pay attention to ventilation equipment and prohibiting children from entering entertainment venues. Recently, the department, in view of the possibility of mutual transmission between barbers and customers, has instructed patrol officers to go to barbershops to [illegible] that barbers wear dense masks. After the opening, anyone found to be violating the fixed regulations will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Music Performance: Solo Recital by Ms. Mao Aili</h3>
<p>"Vocal music" is "singing." When it comes to female vocal music talents, Ms. Lang Tongxiu is praised by everyone, but in North China, Ms. Mao Aili also occupies an important position. Ms. Mao is a disciple of the singing king Su Shilin. While studying under Su, she specialized in music at Yenching University for three years. She holds solo recitals every year in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. Her advantage is that she can perform the lyrics and the meaning of the song at the same time. Therefore, Ms. Mao Aili's singing is as easy to understand as watching an opera. Those who are interested in music can appreciate it, and those who do not know music theory can also understand it. It is heard that the Shanghai Orchestral Team will accompany her in her solo recital in Shanghai this time.</p>
<p>In addition, an indoor concert led by the famous young violinist Ma Sihong will be held at the Happy Grand Theater at 5:30 pm on the 14th of this month (Monday). All the programs are modern French works, including Fauré's violin sonata, Louis Ibert's cello sonata, Mrs. Shackleton's steel [illegible], and Mrs. Crow Lack's solo, especially with Ma Sihong's technique, which is loved and appreciated by music lovers.</p>

The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>Sir, the Qing Bao reported today that "Vice Minister Kong Xian [illegible] came to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate Hu in Shanghai's property,". I, the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Justice concurrently serve as the director of this office.

Fearing that rumors would spread, I am writing to you specifically to request that you correct the record. Sincerely, The Shanghai Office of the Department of Justice, April 19.</p>
<h3>North Star Basketball Team Lost to Xiqing Yesterday; Team Leaves Shanghai for Changzhou Today</h3>

The North Star will leave Shanghai and return north tomorrow, first going to Changzhou to play two games, then to Wuxi before returning north.</p>
<h3>Various Allocated Materials Fail to be Distributed as Scheduled; Citizens Hope Authorities Will Adjust Institutions</h3>
<p>Regarding the household rice in the First District of this city, every period in the past could be distributed as scheduled. However, from the end of last month to the present, there is no definite date for the distribution of household rice for the 67th period. This time, the household rice has been delayed repeatedly for as long as two periods, which has led to a sharp rise in black market rice prices. Generally, citizens feel that two liters of rice distributed per period is not enough to sustain themselves. This time, it has been delayed repeatedly again. For the sake of stabilizing people's livelihood, the authorities, especially the grain authorities, should urge the distribution as soon as possible. In addition, the general citizens of this city hope that the authorities will adjust the allocation institutions immediately because the current allocation certificates for matches, soap, oil, and black [illegible] of citizens have not been implemented as scheduled, resulting in the black market prices of various allocated materials rising daily. The general public is deeply pained by this blow.</p>
<h3>British Troops in Imphal Surrounded: Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks</h3>
<p>The spokesperson of the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai, China, yesterday at 2 p.m., during the routine press conference, met with Chinese news reporters from this city and spoke about the unique nature of the great annihilation battle in Imphal. The spokesperson first stated: The Imphal great annihilation battle, where the Japanese and Indian armies fight side by side, is of utmost significance both militarily and politically. Japan, with clever strategy and thorough preparation, is advancing extremely smoothly and is confident that astonishingly great results will be obtained.</p>
<p>Imphal Encirclement Situation</p>
<p>Then, he explained the encirclement situation and actual conditions of Imphal, with Imphal as the center, divided into the following points: In the northern sector, they have already advanced to the St. Mai area, five kilometers from Imphal. This line is closest to Imphal, so the fighting is quite fierce. In the northeastern sector, they have advanced to the Tangmika area, seven kilometers from Imphal. In the southeastern sector, on the Palel front, about twenty kilometers southeast of Imphal, the Japanese army is continuing to fight fiercely against the main enemy forces in this strong and consolidated fortress. In the southern sector, operations are underway between Loktak Lake and Selloi Ching, and Bishenpur (located eighteen kilometers south of Imphal). Another unit advanced from the west of Moirang and has already occupied the highest ground of that hill, so the Imphal plain can be seen clearly. Regarding the enemy forces at Bishenpur, due to the occupation of Selloi Ching, they cannot establish contact and have been cut off. One part is fleeing towards Imphal, while another part is attempting to flee towards Shirui, but because the Japanese air force bombed and destroyed the large iron bridge east of Nambol early on, the retreat route has also been cut off by the Japanese army. The western area, with its continuous natural mountain terrain, has become a natural obstacle. The only retreat route was originally the Nambol iron bridge, which has been destroyed, so they have become turtles in a jar. The enemy forces trapped in the encirclement are just waiting to be annihilated. The enemy forces include the 17th, 20th, and 23rd divisions, and the mechanized brigade under the Fourth Corps. These forces have been severely disrupted by the fierce Japanese attacks. Currently, it is estimated that only the 23rd division and the mechanized brigade can maintain their strength. The total number of enemy soldiers in the encirclement is estimated to be around 100,000.</p>
<p>Special Characteristics in Political and Military Terms</p>
<p>Regarding the special characteristics of the Imphal offensive, politically, it has established the political and military position of the Free India Provisional Government. Militarily, the enemy forces trapped in the siege will be completely annihilated, and not a single soldier will be left. Therefore, breaking into Imphal is quite easy to achieve under the current circumstances. Objectively speaking, it may be considered somewhat slow. The special characteristic of the advance in this area is that in order to seize several important bases, the objective is to annihilate the enemy's forces. First, fully prepare for battle, and each army taking the encirclement formation must establish contact and launch a combined general attack, ensuring that not a single enemy soldier escapes. The current situation in Imphal is at this stage. To cite a compelling example, in early April, in the Tarnosky and Kolotsche areas of the German-Soviet war zone, the First Ukrainian Front under Suvorov encircled about five German divisions. At that time, a Soviet regiment rashly rushed into the siege, eager to achieve merit, and was annihilated by the German army. At this time, the German army took the opportunity to break through the encirclement and escaped danger. Therefore, the Japanese army will only break in after completing all preparations. Regarding the situation in Imphal, it is currently the rainy season. The power of several armies' infantry and mechanized forces is gradually being hampered. The Japanese and Indian armies' advances can be carried out fully. The enemy is hampered by obstacles, so the Japanese army's advance is extremely smooth. Therefore, the crisis in Imphal is causing great panic and unease among the British and American authorities. The recent criticism of Mountbatten is one example.</p>
<p>Mountbatten in a Wretched State</p>
<p>Regarding Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command, it finally moved from New Delhi to Ceylon Island on the 16th of this month. This shows Mountbatten's disadvantage and his wretched move of the command headquarters. In addition, the general attitude of Chinese people in Chongqing towards the future of the "War of Resistance" is quite pessimistic. The number of pessimists in March was twice that in February, while the number of optimists decreased by half. The number of people advocating "War of Resistance" decreased by one-sixth compared to February, while the number of people hoping for peace increased by one-tenth. The reason for the changes in Chongqing in March is due to the failure of the "counter-offensive" in Burma, which caused this change. There is no doubt that the people under the rule of Chongqing are expressing extreme disappointment.</p>

<p>Heard on the Evening News at 6:50 PM Yesterday</p>
<h3>Abandoning the Root and Pursuing the Branch</h3>
<p>Why is it that people abandon the root and pursue the branch? Some wealthy merchants and tycoons readily spend huge sums of money on private clubs for personal enjoyment, and even employ private security to ensure safety, but are stingy in donating to social welfare undertakings, even those related to public safety, such as the recently held Police Welfare Cooperative movement. This is an example of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch. Some people with shallow wills readily embrace the idea of taking risks and seeking luck, willingly spending their hard-earned money on openly gambling venues like dog racing tracks, but are oblivious to the ancient saying "Diligence in industry and frugality in life," and the principle of adapting clothing to the season and observing dietary needs. This is another example of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch.</p>
<p>"Those who do not think far ahead will have trouble close at hand." This is where the danger of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch lies. If the production sector only cares about immediate profits without considering whether the structure of production is sound, the result will inevitably be the inability to maintain the longevity of its future production business. If consumers only care about immediate enjoyment without considering the wartime environment and the future of the war, the result will inevitably be the inability to maintain even the minimum level of survival in the future. The danger of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch lies in this.</p>
<p>Based on such a perspective, we are willing to sincerely urge economic figures and the entire consuming public to broaden their horizons from now on, either working hard to increase production, or devoting themselves to public undertakings. At the same time, we must resolutely eradicate all bad habits. Only then can there be hope for a clear wartime economy and society.</p>

<h3>Appealing to the Old Eighth District to Improve the Method of Issuing "Ration Coupons"</h3>
<p>In the past, the Eighth District issued coupons for buying rice, etc., based on the baojia system. For example, a notice would be issued in advance stating that coupons would be issued to a certain lian or bao at a certain date and time. When the time came, people would enter in an orderly manner according to the baojia sequence, and the coupons would be checked and issued. This method was excellent because it prevented people from rushing to be first and did not require them to stand for long periods. This time, the issuance of coupons was suddenly changed to be based on the area in which you live to pick up on a certain date, thus severing ties with the baojia system. Judging from the original intention of the legislation, there may be something desirable about it. However, common people experience suffering that is unbearable, and I would like to express it.</p>
<p>A resident of Tailu Street should, according to the law, go to 485 Guilin Road on the 17th. When I arrived at 8:30, there was already a long snake-like line. Those who arrived later all lined up on the rubble field. Standing in the open air, in the cold wind and rain, was extremely tiring, but there was no way to withdraw temporarily, so I had to endure it. (At that time, there were quite a few people who shouldn't have been picking up coupons on this day and at this place, who also came in line, and only later withdrew. This shows that the knowledge of the common people is actually very different from what the authorities expected.) When I returned home, it was already 9:45. Previously, all those who received coupons had to attach last year's November donation ticket to the January and February house donation tickets for verification. As a result, there were some people who did not know this in advance and had to withdraw, further hindering others. Inside, there were long counters with five or six window openings labeled "Reception." Those who entered were divided into groups and lined up again. The clerk collected the donation tickets and gave each person a number plate. With the number plate, they would then wait at another window labeled "Issuance." Because there were many windows for issuing cards, those holding cards all gathered here, and because the numbers were different, they could no longer line up in an orderly fashion, and the order was greatly disrupted. Those holding cards who crowded the window could make four or five circles. The clerk inside called out a certain number in front of which a certain number should be, but blocked by the wall of people, it was necessary to break through the center, but those who were close to the window were not necessarily the number that was being called, so they also had to endure the suffering of being pressed. Initially, there were separate lines for men and women in the square, but when it came to holding the card and exchanging the coupon, they were combined. Everyone had just come from the rain, their muddy feet trampled on each other, rain gear was mixed together, and the humidity and the smell of sweat evaporated into a strange odor that made people want to vomit. I got the card at 10 o'clock, and when I exchanged the coupon and left, it was already after 11 o'clock, and I could no longer deal with other things in the morning.</p>
<p>Having experienced this, there is much I cannot help but say. The baojia system, if its main thread is pulled, all the eyes will open, and if its discipline is pulled, all the eyes will rise. Abandoning the baojia system and using a land division system is not advisable. Exposed to rain and sun, middle-class families have no servants to use, how can housewives withstand this? Moreover, most of those who come here are servants and the like, and are mostly uneducated. How can they prevent the middle class from regarding it as a daunting task? This is the second point. The Chinese people, who value integrity and character, had in ancient times those who did not eat "condescending handouts." Today, the humiliation is even greater than "condescending handouts," but their "food" cannot be obtained without spending money. How can "civic personality" be respected? This is the third point. "Legislation must be good." If those in authority think about improving it, everyone will praise it with joy. (Qu Quechou)</p>
<h3>World Red Swastika Society Distributes Epidemic Prevention Medicines</h3>
<p>Recently, as the weather has gradually warmed up, epidemics have become more prevalent, and medicine prices are high, the general poor and sick are unable to afford them. The World Red Swastika Society, with compassion and care, has specially prepared various effective medicines. Yesterday, they sent to this office 1,000 doses of Puji Dan (suitable for all seasons), 50 doses each of Leiji San and Piliwu San (both kinds are for meningitis), and 100 doses of Tianzhong Tea (suitable for epidemic use), for a total of 1,200 doses, to be provided to the poor and sick. Their benevolent spirit is commendable. On behalf of the beneficiaries, I extend my sincere thanks.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>—By Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yangyi</p>
<p>The next morning, after everyone got up, they received a paper order: "All candidates report to the ship's bridge."</p>
<p>Zhenren and others didn't know what was happening. When they ran to the ship's authority, their eyes were already able to see the direction to the left, in the reddish-purple morning glow. A huge black shadow appeared.</p>
<p>"That's Diamond Head..." The instructor, who was looking through binoculars, said this.</p>
<p>The island called Honolulu is a bit strange, and the mountains that stretch along the harbor seem to be a slightly damaged piece of brick and tile. Having seen this, I already felt that I had arrived in Honolulu. Oahu gradually grew larger on the ship's left.</p>
<p>"It's not a very lovable mountain!"</p>
<p>"Look, it's a mountain hiding a fort..."</p>
<p>The reputation of Diamond Head is not very great, but the overlapping, colorful, and verdant scenery around Pearl Harbor is indeed very moving and makes one reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>(Hey, it seems like I've seen this exquisite scene somewhere.)</p>
<p>Zhenren thought this in his heart. After pondering for a moment, he finally remembered. It was when he was studying at the Second Middle School, when he went to Osumi, or to some other place—in short, it was on a ship, on the way back to Kagoshima, that he saw a similar panoramic view from afar. But only the decadent color of the waves is absolutely different. The sea here, like a three-color picture, has a sufficiently bright green color. It's just like the color of emerald green placed in a glass water bottle.</p>
<p>Zhenren lowered his head and stared at the sea, seeing something like black shadows swimming back and forth in the sea.</p>
<p>"Hey, what's that?" One of the candidates also noticed those things and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Those are sharks. There are many of them here," Lieutenant E told them.</p>
<p>Soon, the candidates went down to the ship's cabin for breakfast, then changed into their uniforms and ran back onto the deck. At this time, in order to welcome the pilot, the ship was completely slowed down. It had already reached the outer harbor of Honolulu, and the entire silhouette of Diamond Head was fully visible. On the colorful sea, many small fishing boats and motorboats came side by side.</p>
<p>"Look! Those are the welcoming boats of the Japanese residents," Lieutenant E said.</p>
<p>"Then, were the sharks just now also here to welcome us?" While everyone was talking and laughing, the shadows of the small boats gradually grew larger. Every boat was crowded and fully loaded with people. Among them were men desperately waving Panama hats. Among them were also women gently and gracefully waving their kimono sleeves and cheering with their hands. In an instant, the earth-shattering cheers of "Banzai, Banzai" also penetrated into the eardrums. People on the ship also waved their hands to show their gratitude. All the ships were hanging with both the large and small Rising Sun flags and American Stars and Stripes. Captain R, seeing this scene, said as if he didn't understand:</p>
<p>"It's the opposite of my voyages in previous years. This time, the American Stars and Stripes are bigger than the Rising Sun flag."</p>
<p>(Seven)</p>
<p>Amid the booming of salutes, the ship quietly entered Honolulu Harbor. From its appearance, it was really unexpected, looking very poor. The famous Aloha Tower was originally not a special clock tower. The population is smaller than Kobe, and lush green trees cover the entire city. However, on closer inspection, instead of saying it's poor, it's better to say it's full of character. It doesn't have the domineering air of a big city, but has the colorfulness of a typical coastal city, as well as the clear fog. The closer you get, the more you seem to melt into it. Amidst a patch of greenery, magnificent buildings stand scattered into the sky, and each one flies the Stars and Stripes high.</p>
<p>"It really has a foreign flavor!"</p>
<p>Zhenren and others, standing on the deck, thought this in their hearts. The seawater seemed very deep, and the two warships were moored alongside the rock wall lined with warehouses. The top of the rock wall was full of cars, crowds, and small national flags. Looking at it from a distance, it seemed that they were all foreigners, but in reality, they were all Japanese. This surprisingly large crowd was actually made up of so many Japanese. You could even see people wearing Japanese kimonos and women dragging wooden clogs in the crowd.</p>
<p>"Banzai! Banzai!"</p>
<p>In the crowd, there were people dancing like they were in a Shinto performance and waving their hands and feet.</p>
<h3>Chong Hua Tang Free Clinic</h3>

Starting from April 1st, every day from 1:00 PM to 3:30 PM, doctors specializing in internal medicine, gynecology, pediatrics, and surgery will be invited to the clinic to provide free medical care (closed on Sundays).</p>
<h3>Stagnant Ditch Endangers Hygiene</h3>
<p>There is a stagnant ditch at the northern end of Lane 26, Fanhuangbo Road (formerly Route Ghisi-Fei), and under Tianyao Bridge in Xujiahui. All year round, stagnant water accumulates, and when the summer comes, mosquitoes and flies breed, which is especially harmful to hygiene. It is hoped that the First District Public Works Bureau and Hygiene Department will pay attention to this. The citizens would be very grateful. (Ye Deren)</p>
