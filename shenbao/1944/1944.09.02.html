<p>社評</p>
<h3>我的重慶政權觀（下）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問：蔣介石本身對於全面和平的意見怎樣？根據「中國之命這」一書中他所表示的思想，他好像是一位抗戰到底論者。據說他非常頑固，而有一經決公，百折不橈的性格。</p>
<p>答·你對於蔣介石的意見，不免有膚淺之險。關於蔣介石的人物評傳，在近七八年來層出不窮，因為不管張三李四，阿毛阿狗，都拿起筆來談上幾句蔣介石。其中多半都是對他歌功頌德，拍馬奉承等肉麻連篇的字句。如不是這一類，就是專迎合日本意向，而狗血噴頭地向他署駡抨擊的攻擊文字。總之，這兩種評論，都難令人苟同。（如斯文。赫丁著的「蔣介石傳」，只表示出一種事實，說中亞的偉大探險家，不一定是人類學上的偉大探險家）。但令我佩服到頂的蔣介石之「人物評論」，只有一本。即一九二六年三月二十日，蔣介石在廣東第一次開始屠殺共產黨的時候，於翌月，廣東的中共指導者斯太潘諾夫，向俄羅斯共產黨所提出的下是蔣介石對俄國願間及中共突然開始聳人聽聞的鎭壓事變……本報吿的目的，即在於說明該事件的幾個原因。該事件固然有許多原因，但其中發動者蔣介石以及我們同志的個別性格，實起莫大作用。因此關於蔣介石的高興，有稍加詳細叙述的必要。我在此處所指出的他之性格，也是中國共產黨中央委員會代表共同承認者。蔣介石在我和中共看來，是具有明顯特徵的特殊人物。他最顯著的本性，就是野心與權力等的慾望。他意欲在全部中國人民面前，表現爲一個英雄。他自稱自爲革命家，但他所說的革命家，並非單純指民族革命家而言，而實際還有全世界革命家的意義在內。然而間題是在於他所說的革命名詞在何種意義上理解。他是喜歡權力與金錢的。我在此處應當特別指出者，即據我所知，他之所以喜歡金錢，決不是自己願意成為富翁，而只是爲了作一漂亮的自由主義姿態。他對於謝禮和饋贈，是不惜大量揮霍金錢的，他爲求報館等擁護自己，為求對已歌功頌德，任情浪費巨款。實際上，蔣介石很聰明（Rather　clever）。他不僅很懂得中國政治問題，而且很瞭解世界政治問題。他不信賴大衆，但願意接受大衆的支持。並且他為了達到自己的政冶目的，而是多少　得一點怎樣利用大衆的。根據同樣目的，他固然利用我們及中國共產黨，但這只是他需要我們的期間如此。同樣，他之所以利用民族革命運動，就是因為他想當民族英雄。因此，他不與中國輿論所抨擊的人物來往。這正是他常常徘衝於「右派」及中共之間的理由，同時我認為這就是使他大聲急呼目前全中國在不斷騷動着「赤禍」的理由……（World　wide　Soviet　Plots　By　N．Mitarevsty22～23頁）」。</p>
<p>自然，這份報吿書是他的政敵所寫的，然而像這樣簡單明瞭，深刻中肯地描畫出他的特徵來的文章，尙不多見。</p>
<p>他為了達到自已的目的，而利用他所能利用的一切。英國，美國，蘇聯，甚至日本，他都利用。凡是能利用者，無不高興加以利所。從這一點來看，他的確是意志堅固的，然而這決不能稱作「頑固」，因為「頑固」是「其頑不靈，一竅不通」的意思。正相反，蔣的敵人甚至也說他「很聰明，他不僅很懂得中國政治問題，而且很瞭解世界政治問題」，如此說來，他決不是「冥頑不靈，一竅不通」的人物。他是「一說即通的人物」。（二二六事件犬養首相被暴徒所襲時，會說「一說即通」，但暴徒並不想聽取犬養的話，而說「無須費話一，於是就把他用槍打死了。這樣的人類，就是「縱說亦不通的人類」。）</p>
<p>他並不想聽取日本大東亞共榮圈的理論，縱令用「世界四大强國」的動人字句來誘惑他，但他也不肯上圈套。同時，我相信他也很淸楚地知道，藉抗戰到底而取得利益者，決不是重慶。因此，這就是我堅信全面和平定有希望的理由。</p>
<p>問：旣然蔣介石和國粹派，像你所說，有與日本談判和平的意向，那來中國共產黨豈不老早就看破了麼？</p>
<p>答：就是這樣。國共交涉的困難點也就在此。中共的最後目的，自然是在於建設社會主義中國。重慶政權只要在這一方向可能加以利用時，中共則重視這一利用價値，而總不想擯棄他的。然而重慶政權，不久即將完全成為親英美派的天下，或將成為美國的經濟附庸國，或將與日本妥協——這一決定時期逐漸迫近了——，如果這樣，中共隨時都準備與重慶進人完全武裝對立的狀態。中共對於重慶政權的推想，簡單說來就是如此。情勢日益緊急了。重慶政權在不久的將來，非作最後的決定不可了，或投到日本懷裏，或與美國携手，非此即彼，二者必居其一。當在二者中進行何取何捨時，代表民族資本比代表買辦資本更大的蔣介石，一定選擇准許民族資本獨立發展有校多可能的日本，與之妥協。因為現在蔣介石最怕美國勝利時中國將成為墨西哥第二。墨西哥的民族資本，完全隷屬於美國金融資本之下。正與此相同，戰後美國金融資本——試想一下其巨大勢力與追求益潤的慾望！——，將壟斷中國的所有企業，而完全統治中國的民族資本。蔣介石已經不再怕日本的金融資本壟斷中國的企業了。他相信日本不可能征服全部中國。唯此時所怕者，是戰後的美國與戰後的蘇聯。中國共產黨很淸楚地知道，中國民族資木恐懼美國與蘇聯，而在催促蔣介石選擇與日本妥協的道路。</p>
<p>問：中國共產黨是否有應付這一點的腹稿呢？</p>
<p>答：中共究竟有怎樣的腹稿，凡很難說的，或許尙沒有一致的計劃。然而根據重慶的親蘇派意見，則中共似乎將以現在的延安政權爲中心，將建設社會主義新中國。歐洲問題澈底解決後，蘇聯就有充分的餘力。因此，蘇聯對於中日問題是不會水久維持完全無發言權的現狀的。重慶內部的親蘇派推測蘇聯有這樣的意願，無便想在大東亞戰爭達到決定階段時，則請蘇聯出馬參加。同時他們想藉蘇聯的力量，在中國北部建立社會主為中國，以與重慶政權相對立。蘇聯對於這一親蘇派的想法是否贊同？這要看蘇聯那時的世界政策如何而決定。史太林一向是「吃熟柿主義者」，所以那時的客觀條件如不成熟，史太林是不會參加大東亞戰爭的，因為他無論如何是不吃生柿子的。然而不要忽略，這種想法在中共的年靑份子和重慶的親蘇派當中，是有相當勢力的。毛澤東和周恩來年齡已較大，所以他們在極力抑制這種思想。毛澤東和周恩來非到不得已的最後關頭，是不願刺激蔣介石的。中共的中下級幹部固然未會忘記蔣介石前此在江西和上海屠殺自己同志的仇恨，然而毛澤東和周恩來却越過私人的感情，認為蔣介石這樣人物只要對民族革命有益，則想利用到一直不能再用為止。關於這一點，前面所說的斯太潘諾夫報吿書的最後，曾有下列有意義的一句話：</p>
<p>「另外一個要素，就是蔣介石的個性。只要這樣非常人物存在着，則我們自然必須用盡所有手段，利用他達到民族革命的目的。我們暫時不談蔣介石有多少革命家的成份，或有多少反革命家的成份，而應當注意者，是不要從我們的共同事菜中把他丟出去。因為他的性格（假如我們的佔計正確），是民族革命鬥爭過程上能够利用的性格。這不僅是我們的意見，而也是上海中共中央委員會以及廣東委員的意見。」</p>
<p>他們在十七年前，就會道樣高度估計過蔣介石的利甩價値。今日蔣介石旣為抗戰中國的「民族英雄」，當然他的利用價値，業巳登峯造極。所以毛澤東和周恩來是於不輕　　開他的。（以下轉入第叫版）</p>
<h3>切斷印度洋接濟　日潛艇積極活動　擊沉敵油糟船貨船等多艘</h3>
<p>印度洋某基地一日中央社電蒙特巳頓所部印印度洋艦隊，刻正積極從事增强兵力及接濟物資，日潛艇為切斷其接濟路綫起見，目前正積極活動中。某月某日返基地之日大型潛水艇，於出戰期時內，僅數日間即擊毀敵油糟船若干艘，貨船若干艘，共達若干萬噸。</p>
<h3>一油糟船炸成兩段</h3>
<p>該潛艇某月某日新出動於某某羣島西方海面，搜索敵運輸船，至下午三時，突發現敵船跡影，是時適値敵哨戒艇出現，乃暫時實施潛航，隱避宋久，艦長傳令謂：發見敵船，立即追踪，於是潛艇即採取襲擊戰術，是時艦長謂敵船係七千噸之油糟船，旋雙方距離漸形接近，聽音室中即傳令發射魚雷，少頃由彼方傳來魚雷轟擊之鉅聲，蓋已命中，彼等驚恐聲，騷擾聲亦陸續傳來，同時火光由敵船後部門中部冒出，日潛艇遂急速浮出水面，駛近敵船向其繼續射擊，然浮力强大之油糟船，並不即刻沉沒，彼等亦發砲還擊，勉强應戰，日潛艇所投放之魚雷，劃波而進，對敵船作最後之打擊，當時水柱洶湧，高騰數十丈，於是龐大之巨艦，遂被炸為購段，後部沉沒水中，前部則打起在空中廻轉之水花，然後漸次沉沒。</p>
<h3>航空機材木船擊沉</h3>
<p>某月某日下午十時許，在敵陣中央部之巨船，亦曾墜入日方包圍綱，其後在漆黑之海上，以潛望鏡照射之，始悉敵船係一五千噸級之貨船，於是始襲擊，以魚雷向敵艦發射，是時適為下午十一時三十分，當時對貨船卒被命中，而披火災危困，旋即打出救助信號，不久竟以最高之速度，從海上悄然遁去。某月某日，日潛艇以砲彈三發，擊沉滿載航空機材約一百噸之敵木造船一艘，後不及三十小時，更在水平綫發現敵船踪影，乃加開速率追擊，復以精巧之大型望遠鏡，探視其實體，知悉該艦係敵英傾盡科學精華造成之七千噸級新銳油糟貨船，時正向鍚蘭島悠悠行進，對於日軍之奇襲，毫未發覺，斯時，日潛艇乃急速潛航追擊，將一發必中之魚雷，陸續向敵艦猛烈發射，經過十秒，廿秒，卅秒鐘間，宏大之爆炸音，遂在敵艦側響動，盡已命中矣。</p>
<h3>岡部大將任　華北日陸軍　最高指揮官　岡村大將轉任某要職</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　陸軍省一日發表：任陸軍大將岡部直三郞為華北日軍最高指揮官。現任華北最高指揮官岡村大將，轉任某要職。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日岡村寗次大將，自民國三十年七月繼多田駿大將之後，出任華北日陸軍最高指揮官，迄今已滿三載，其間大將於大東亞戰爭與對渝戰事建樹頗多，前已轉任某要職。當茲日軍發動大陸新作戰，中國戰局進入劃期階段之際，岡部直三郞大將繼岡村大將爲華北日陸軍最高指揮官，擔任華北重任，更堪期待。</p>
<h3>控制阿拉伯海怒濤</h3>
<p>日潛艇爲改造砲擊戰，遂急行浮上海面，艇內砲兵即以準確之射擊，向敵船發射，敵船當即受創起火，但因係一新建之船，故雖遭重傷不易沉沒，經過五分鐘至十分鐘後，火勢益為猛烈，高騰空際，使日艇之雄姿完全反映於漆黑之海上，移時日潛艇遂改取潛航退避行動，蓋因潛艇在敵陣內易成為敵艦攻擊之目標，殊為危險，故當魚雷爆炸後，即確認敵艦已隨爆炸音之後面沉沒，敵沉沒時在日潛艇攻擊約二小時後，日潛艇此次越過印度洋，不斷從事辛苦之作戰，目的係在控制阿拉伯海之怒濤，而切斷英美海上交通之動脈。</p>
<h3>臺灣昨空襲　擊落美機四架</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電八月三十一日晚十時許，曾有駐渝美空軍B24型及B25型機十餘架來襲臺灣，經日機邀擊，擊落其四架（內兩架未證實），日方陸上損失極輕微。</p>

<p>南京一日中央社電　鄕村建設實施委員會，進行籌組，兩三日內成立。各實騐縣一期工作，九月至十二月按期推進工作</p>
<p>南京一日中央社電　行政院鄕村建設實施委員會即將成立，鄒委員長特發表談話如下：國人渴望治平久矣，政府軫念時艱，在本年度開始時，發布肅正思想，確保治安，增加生產之點，為本年施政方針，以慰民望。期於興華保亞，共存共榮之國策上，加厚力量，鞏固　礎。凡關心國事，愛好和平之士，莫不引領相望，薪臻修明。於是有實施鄕村建設，選定實騐縣之　劃，以為</p>
<p>正本淸源之計。輕呈准最高國防會議議決設置，委員會，主持其事，茲已依限成立，開始工作，此實爲還都後洞切時要之新興機構，且爲地方行政推陳出新之一大轉捩，補屈救弊，莫善於此，洵屬當務之急者矣。自今以後凡選定之買騐縣內，一切工作，如翠行旣定國策，整理農田水利，振興敎育，改善團警，維護交通，利用厚生，淸　賦稅，置倡工業諸端，均須次第推進，無任　此失彼，致　偏枯。歷來所有</p>
<p>饋遣供應送往迎來，索賄行略，藉端　削議惡習，尤當嚴加查察，縣為　禁，　務使弊絕風淸，貪汚歛跡。苟有以身試法者，則按律以繩，不稍寬假，此工作初步扼要之端，不容姑息與忽略者也。工作人員之登進黜陟，則以材適其用，任適基入爲標準，但憑試騐與考成，不受面情干託，一面培育人才，備作幹部，延攬名流，以充師資。舉措悉循規矩，則官守</p>
<p>無虞隕越矣。一縣之　騐旣減，推而至於他縣，事輕途熟，事半功倍，則時日不處玩愒，知本此以赴事機，則他日樹立民洽根基，培養國民生計，增進農業生產，完遂聖戰目的，均將以此為　矢，不其恣歟。顧事屬創局，有若臨深，責重任艱，彌滋　惕，惟冀我內外工作口人，各宜淬厲精誠，和衷共濟，實事求是，奮發有為。本羣策羣力之勞，以挽救鄕村之沒落，鄕建之事業完成，方域之昇平可覩，</p>
<p>國家命脈民族生育，成敗利鈍，胥繁於此，固不僅為本年施政之重點力　貫澈已也。今當本會成立之始，敢以一言，敬與國人相晑助勉，更有望於海內明哲，農村父老，曁研究鄉建諸學者，不吝敎益，敢予匡正，以期無負朝野上下殷殷期待之至意，本會前途，其庶幾乎。</p>
<h3>日緖方總裁　發表談話</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日緖方情報局總裁，本日就此次任命政務官事，發表談話謂：政府此次改革過去各省委員制度，設置政務次官及參與官，巳於本日見該發表，為集結國民總力，第一要着，在積極暢達民意，依民意之昻揚，始可造成究整不找之決戰體制，使與國民全體協力，向完遂戰爭之目的邁進。</p>

<p>中國前綫某基地一日中央社電日軍新銳戰鬥機隊，三十日下午二時十三分，於長沙北方三十公里地帶上空，發現渝美戰鬥機六架，常即邀擊之，繫落其三架。</p>
<h3>恩施遂川機塲被炸</h3>
<p>中國前綫某基地一日中央社電　日軍航空隊，三十日夜復以轟炸機編隊，攻擊渝軍恩施遂川機塲，空襲恩施之一隊日機，冒惡劣天氣，實行熾烈轟炸，有小型機五架中彈起火，並炸毀小型機二架。共他卡車兩輛被炸毀，六處設施中彈起火。奇襲遂川之日機轟炸隊，計炸毀地上設施二處，日機全數安全歸還。</p>
<h3>日大使　泰新閣閣員</h3>

<h3>菲派農業團　赴臺灣考察</h3>
<p>馬尼刺三十一日中央社電　菲律賓政府為調查臺灣農業情形，決定派遺濃業調查委員團赴臺灣考察，並已指定食糧管理局長聖比科台斯爲委員長，拜爾蒙特爲委員。</p>
<h3>和運先生殉國紀念　中樞舉行隆重典禮</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電一日為和平反共建國先烈殉國紀念日，中樞隆重舉行紀念典禮。到各院部會處長官，各機關高級職員三百餘人，褚民誼領導舉行，向和運殉國先烈靈位，行最敬禮。默念致哀，主席獻花圈，奏和運先烈紀念歌，典禮於肅穆軍樂聲中完成。</p>
<h3>龍陵及騰越地區　日軍强力進擊中</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據重慶美聯社訊，怒江戰綫戰况如次：日軍於增援後，即對龍陵，騰越地區渝軍加以攻擊，日軍正自膽越西北城門附近追逐渝軍。據前綫消息，日軍大隊援軍，目下有自芒市附近向東南方移動模樣。渝軍當局三十日夜發表公報稱：日軍一面受渝軍包闡攻勢，一面確保龍陵，同時，强力進擊之日軍增援部隊，一面打開通過該市之公路，已將渝軍主要陣地東南方高地佔領。又據合衆社電稱，日軍曾於二十九日猛攻龍陵南方八公里半渝軍陣地，渝軍曾企圖封鎖芒市與龍陵間之舊緬甸公路，目軍獲得增援後，已將渝軍主要陣地之東南方高地佔領，至該日夜半，仍繼續作戰中，因渝軍死守該地，日軍於同日曾繞至渝軍所築陣地，進攻龍陵南方各陣地，騰越方面渝軍之進攻頗不順利。</p>
<p>滇緬前綫一日中央社電北緬及怒江方面日軍，以出血戰術，予渝軍以莫大損失。八月一日起，約半月間，僅怒江方面，渝軍棄屍即達四一九六具，茲美國為調查渝方窘狀，已派戰時生產局長納爾遜及少將哈特萊赴渝，同時傳鄭洞國為與渝當局研討善後方策，亦返重慶，此種事實，均足以表示渝軍所受打擊，加之渝軍與英。美軍對立亦愈趨尖銳化，侵入密芝那之渝軍新編第一軍副軍長及第三十師長，雖已作重大犧牲，但尙遭史蒂維爾之責難，終於八月三日調回來冬地方，渝方將士對美軍少橫暴，極為憎恨。又滇緬國境方面，最近渝軍與英軍曾發生糾紛，結果渝軍死八十名，傷六十一名，彼等相尅之情，實難於隱瞞。</p>
<h3>美軍勢力日漸　侵入重慶內部</h3>
<p>北緬前錢某基地一日中央社電於北緬山岳地帶，由哈其爾威爾指揮之美式渝軍，自與日軍作戰以來，雖已作莫大犧牲，然仍不悟而繼續反攻中。此等渝軍之裝備，皆係由美國供給，且皆持有新式精銳兵器，計其兵力最初係三師，旋因作戰不利，犧牲增加，遂又自雲南遠征軍中抽調二師，共編成五師，企圖打通中印公路。美國欲僅以强化大陸之對日反攻基地，即將重慶軍事上經濟上之指揮權收歸己有。關於軍事方面，由於此次作戰之結果，事實上已證明渝軍唯有甘供美軍犧牲，美軍之計劃，毫未顧及渝軍所受之損害，其對渝軍與物質作同樣看待，巳極明顯。觀渝軍之前進，自來多至新比安，自新比安至馬因，至密芝那，其遲遲不前之程度，平均每日僅前進六百米，因使作戰上陷於不利之地位。又美軍更不問內外情形，現正從事使渝軍美式化中首當其衝者，為雲南遠征軍之十五師。關於此事，該軍司令官陳誠，曾極力反對，旋即被蔣介石罷免，而以衛立煌代之。因之美軍對該軍之指揮美式化之工作，亦隨之更進一步，哈其爾威爾現正繼績向以昆明為中心之雲南軍，及粵漢綫各戰區軍伸展其執力，因美軍勢力之日漸侵入於重慶內部，以陳誠為中心之將領，刻已釀成强別反對之聲云</p>
<h3>北法戰事　迫近比國邊陲　德軍退出凡爾登·里姆</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國社引德官方戰報稱：法北德軍於敵軍强大之壓力下，已再向東北解脫至索姆河（Somme）區，敵已佔領亞眠（Amiens，在法北部）而向東北方及北方推進。凡爾登（Verdun）之戰事特別激烈，德軍已於午後退出該地。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電海通社訊：德軍退出里姆城（Reims在巴黎東北），秩序井然，民衆並無反德示威遊行，人民恐懼反軸心砲兵及飛機之轟炸，多於晚間避入地窖中。夜間有大隊離城向東面與北面進發，秩序良好，絕非兵敗後之潰退。反軸心軍坦克車先鋒隊企圖在某段肌撓德軍之行動，即為德軍虎型坦克車所擊潰。反軸心軍顯欲切斷德守軍向北撤退之後路，但已吿失敗。</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電海通社訊：反軸心軍增强貢比東南部之右翼後，繼續北進，目前尙無向東進入阿貢納斯山區之趨勢，英軍顯欲與美第三軍大隊相呼應，因大隊佔領里姆後，已越過拉安（Laon）矣，德軍鑒擊敵軍側面與後方予以重創。美第一軍亦向西北及北面進攻，發生激戰。沃斯河（Oise）與海峽沿岸間之德軍繼續北退，藉以避免敵軍之包抄，英軍坦克車隊在沃斯河間猛攻，德軍反攻在布伐斯（Beauvais）以北截繫反軸心軍，該處已變為戰事新重心矣。</p>
<h3>亞特里亞沿岸　德軍北移</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電德國社訊：亞特里亞海沿岸，德軍已於八月二十九日午後，於極少之損害下，自第二綫戰地撤退，英軍已進至哥塔綫三十公里之地點。</p>
<h3>鹽田大尉駁斥　敵美虛偽報道　誇大宣傳荒謬無聊</h3>
<p>滬市盟邦陸海外三報道當局共同主持之聯合報導例會，於咋（一）日下午三時，假南京路外灘滙中飯店五樓，會見本市中國新開記者，計到松島海軍報道部長代表鹽田大尉，大使館上海事務所松平情報部長代表福間副領事等，即席由鹽田大尉就敵美對太平洋上作誇耀虛僞之戰况報道，嚴詞駁斥，最後則對最近敵在渝美空軍三度偷襲上海，經當地日猛烈之高射砲火，予以嚴密射擊後竄逃，無有損署。</p>
<h3>敵方虛報不値一笑</h3>
<p>根據昨（一）日敵方在舊金山所發表之廣播內容，佯稱依據歐戰局之推移，關於日本成敗命運可吿決定云云，日本方面對此點，當置之一笑。余可斷言，凡日本之國民性，如遭遇困難愈多，則其戰鬥能力及民氣愈猛，是即日本建國以來之一實傳統精神。又據八月三十日敵美尼米茲本部之參謀次長福萊斯多薛爾孟所稱之關於太平洋戰況，其談話內容謂，在太平洋戰局上，美海軍已將全力應用，惟據我人對渠之觀察，如今敵美在太平洋上所利用之基地，除夏威夷擊島及馬紹爾羣島之凱塞林島外，其餘則毫無被敵利用，故我人在今後之觀測戰局及戰力上，不得不加以注意。因此，以舊金山及華萊斯多之電稱，已使我人實感覺此為第一流之虛僞宣傳。如今日軍在大宮島及太平洋各個海戰上，繼續猛烈戰鬥，除薩班島及馬紹爾羣島之極小部份，所餘包括南洋廣大島嶼等，悉在日軍之掌握中，故敵力之誇大宣傳，稱太平洋戰局即可解決，此點足證為顯著謊語，實為　誤已極。</p>
<h3>美國艦船損害慘重</h3>
<p>旋又據上月二十九日敵美海軍航空參謀次長奧勃林弗吉所稱，頃美海軍具有航空母艦百艘，根據此項數字而觀，廻憶在塞班島開戰當初，敵美之宜稱數字，亦屬雷同。嗣後在該島經日軍猛烈奮戰，敵方損失正式航艦及補助航艦相當慘重，惟迨至今日之數字，則猶為與該島開戰前之數字相同，實屬荒唐奇兀。我人可根據斯項情形，敵力藉恃數字之優勢，不惜誇耀撤謊，此外對戰力之不理解，及不合理之種種輕舉妄動，殊為無聊，又查日軍在七月下句，由阿留申羣島基斯加基地轉進，而敵方之宜傳則稱在八月十日連續轟炸基斯加，遭受日軍抵抗猛烈等語，但此事經十日之相隔，在上陸時已無日軍，故敵美及加拿大所稱之勝利，足見荒謬無聊之至。</p>
<h3>空襲上海勞師無功</h3>
<p>嗣又對過去之中國靑年羣之感買，與如今比較，逈然不同。部長代表謂，過去一部份之中國靑年，根據戰局之推移，對中國命運之理想，認爲樂觀。惟至今則截然轉變，並非顏英美之協力救國，唯有强化中國本身勢力，奠定堅强基礎才是。最後則稱，自上月八日至今，本市有三式空襲發生，首次情形已詳細發表，第二次為上海至吳淞間區域情形，亦發表頗詳。但逾二日後，敵美史蒂威爾竟稱轟炸日軍物資集積地，其實所投擲炸彈，除一彈落於荒田外，尙有一彈毀損破垣廢屋牛間，如此輕微損害，深則二米，直徑五米，並非為大型彈也。惟第三次於廿九日晚至翌晨一時半之空襲，敵機有向市內投彈企圖，經當地守軍之發射猛烈砲火，紛紛亂竄逃歸，故未投彈云云</p>
<h3>蘇聯進一步　對土施重壓　保代表抵開羅談判休戰</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　德國社訊：據聯合社來自莫斯科之消息，蘇聯絕對決定對保加利亞與土耳其增加壓力，與其在羅馬尼亞之攻勢同時進行。各該國將被迫參加壓迫德軍由巴爾幹撤退之工作，保土兩國已接得此項警吿。莫斯科「眞理報」撰稱，蘇聯已對保加利亞稱，該國之被動態度，不能使蘇方滿意。</p>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　德國社訊，據埃及京城消息：保加利亞代表一行已抵開羅，以便接受反軸心之休戰條件，該消息並稱此事談不到談判二字。</p>

<h3>美生產局長　取道蘇京赴渝</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電德國社訊，據倫敦消息：美戰時生產局長納爾遜，已抵達莫斯科，經簡短之討論後，將繼續前往重慶。</p>
<h3>蘇軍突入華沙　遭堅强抵抗　德利用天險築成防綫</h3>
<p>瑞典京城一日中央社電　馬尼亞戰綫之蘇軍，突破加拉茲隘路之後，一鼓侵人瓦拉幾亞平原，由布曹抵達魯洛葉什特，刻正展開激戰，壓迫弱勢之德軍。又黑海岸之康斯坦薩四方及南方，蘇軍與德軍之問，亦已展開激戰。又據柏林消息，德軍於華沙東北方以步兵四師及大批戰車開始大攻勢，企圖突入華沙市內，但未達市街，即遭德軍之熾烈抵抗，僅佔領普拉　東北方十一公里之火車站。</p>
<p>布達佩斯一日中央社電　德軍茲以三月十九日進駐洪方利之形式，再行進駐捷克斯拉夫，推測德軍此舉，在利用喀爾巴阡山脈之天險，築成最後强力防綫。又傳自布爾來米斯方面向克拉諾進攻之蘇軍，最近已準備大規模行動，德軍為死守西里西亞主要工業地帶，已堅固防禦綫。德軍進駐捷克及洪牙利後，其方針在怖成捷克國境至達瑯西里尼亞之喀爾巴阡山脈鐵桶般防綫，阻止進攻德本土之蘇軍。</p>
<h3>郭培爾氏著文　表示堅決信念</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在「德國週刋」發表論文，略稱：德軍後備兵之各項需要、均由平民負祖，並已採取各項措置，應付將來之需要矣。關於武器，反軸心國在技術方面，超越德國，其優勢未能迅速與以克服，然德國漸佔優勢，亦無可否認，較為有利于德國之戰局，行將來臨矣。倘以為運用新武器後，可以使戰局立即變為有利於德國，實屬愚蠢，此項決定性之發展，尤須徐國寶現。吾人應稍稍忍耐，吾人不應期待德國僅頗神秘武器轉，戰局，德軍之作戰技術變將有較爲和緩之發展，然敵方應付德國之戰爭機構，必有焦頭爛額之感。</p>

<h3>短評　議院限電問題</h3>
<p>本市水電限制，尤其典禮的一再限制，在當局立場自然有絕對必要的理由。在用戶立場自然也有絕對遵守的義務。不過，在限制的數量上，應有兩種不同的區別。　純消費者應限至最小限度，浪費者應絕對禁止。　戰時必需品的生產部門，戰時必需工作部門，社會公益部門，應酌量保持必需限度。關於這種區別，架信當局也必加以考慮，不致漢視的，最近經濟局對於工廠用電調查，及實業部將調整上海工廠用電，即此一端。</p>
<p>至於社會公益部門，譬如醫院爲病人施行手術的工具上，用軍力無法節減，這種事實目應酌最維持必要用量。近來我們接到很多醫院來信，說明無法卽减的理由，而電力公司方面未能願到實　需要，將依照限制辦法執行　電，對於醫務及病人方面頗感困南。</p>
<p>根據限制用電合理的區別原則，我們認為醫院，在醫務上必要的用電，不能與消費浪費同樣看待，希望電力當局從長考虛酌予合理調整，以社公益。</p>
<p>最後値得附帶複述的節電一法，我們在今年三月九日知評中說：「層每日中旬－初八至十八日－月色　明（雨天例外）馬路微弱的街燈光度，在月光之下雖有若無，在此期期問，不如免除街電，而移售燈所田電力，補給生趣與公特事業力的不足。這樣猖獗，這幾年來，尤其自參加大東亞戰爭以後，盟邦的協　，可謂仁至義盡，國民含古茹辛，對於政府的期特與忍耐，亦算到了極點，我們在今天想想，死難先烈固無慷於國民，國民亦無愧於先烈一，不過我們後死的同志，太對不起先烈與國民了。</p>
<p>和平運動到目前，因為主觀客觀條件的錯綜複雜，全面和平幾至絕望，但是和運之目的在救國，而其過程，非先達封全面和平不能實現救國的心願，根據這種定理，無論全面和平的途徑如何曲折，我們祗有勇住邁進，不達目標不止。</p>
<p>我們明白了我們的目標，就應當秉　先烈的精神，循着正常的途徑向前努力，所以我希望後死的同志鬥：　公而忘私以求　政治修明　第一應秉着先烈「公而忘私」的精神，以求政治的修明。一談到全面和平，一般人多注意軍事的發展，自然在重慶當局仍迷信着最後勝利的時候，車事的發展自屬重要。詎知政治的爭取，其效力更切實偉大，因為全面和平不是少數領袖人物的和平，而是全體國民的和平，小是屈服或强迫的和平，而是由內心自覺的和平，爭取這種和平的最大動力，是和平區域內的修明的政治，囚為修明的政治，可以使人民生活安定，可以減少人民不必有的痛苦，人民之知識雖低，他們對於政治的感覺非常敏銳，對他們談和戰，他們慶不關心，對他們談大亞洲主義，他們也不感覺興極，對他們談ABCD戰綫，他們更莫明其妙，如右人能使他們要居藥業，或減少他們的痛苦，他們就不問政府是甲是乙的必寺通風從，歌功頌德說：「這是我們的靑天」。如果四萬萬五千萬國民，有三萬萬歸向和平區內，全面和平還能不實現嗎？</p>
<p>自和平運動開始以來，我們祗寺見軍事的門爭，思想的鬥爭，經濟的門爭，沒有看見政洽的此賽，相反的，我們祇看到一部份官吏的日益寡廉鮮恥，社會秩序之日益紊亂，入間是非之日益混淆，人民生活之日益因苦，在此政治腐敗，社會墮落，民不聊生的情形下，想獲得以民衆為基礎的全面和平</p>
<p>我體察這一切腐敗　落的原因，無非是一個「私」字在作崇，所以我們首先要秉着先烈「公而忘私」的精神，以求政治的修社，所謂「亂世重典」，這句話確由痛苦的經騐得來，我們應以斷然的大公無私的手段，削除一切貪官汚吏，使政治得以漸上軌道，民生漸得安定，人心來歸，決非外力所能阻止。</p>
<h3>視死如歸與反　動勢力搏鬥</h3>
<p>第二，我們要以失烈視死如歸的精神與反動勢力共產黨相搏鬥，共產黨根據他們歪曲的理論，硬把原有的社會秩序破壞，原有的國家組織瓦解，在落後的半封建式的農業社會裏，製造出人類的互相仇殺，以代替所謂階級門爭。凡我國民要考處到國家民族的生存問題，對於共產黨的存在與發展，決不能漢不關心，或置之不理。有人說：一個國家內同時存在幾個黨派者，不　其例，何以人家可以共同有在，我們非火拚不可呢？殊不知其他各國的黨派，則為普通的政黨，他們沒有　氏改造社會的整套計劃，不需要將舊的政治制度整個推翻，他們沒有軍隊，更不需以武力奪取政權，他們的進退，則採取民主方式。中國國民黨是革命黨，中國共產常也自命為革命黨，都要建設新的社會，都有武力，都要奪取政權，一個國家又祇有一個政權，現在是國民黨拿到政權不放手，共產黨要來竊奪，在這種情形之下，兩個黨沒有槍則打拳頭，兩邊都有武力，有什麼方法不打仗呢？就以重慶來說，為的要與共產黨維持統一戰綫，則白法謀求妥協。到現在骨十裹的磨擦，不僅無法消減，連外表的妥協，幾巳不可能，因此我認為國民黨之反共，是國民黨的命運所決定，愛國民衆之反共，則是愛國民衆的義務所決定，我們對於這個不幸的命運與魏務是無法逃避，也無需逃避的，所以我們祇有以先烈視死於歸的精神，與共產黨徒搏鬥到底。</p>
<h3>勇猛刻苦完成　國家建設</h3>
<p>第三，我們要有先烈的自信力，以勇括刻苦的精神，完成國家的建設，我們要想渡過某神　關，完成某種偉大事業，是要看自信如何以為斷的。臂如一件事，成功的條件並不具備，而當事者自信力過强，特別努力，也許可以成功，相反的，一件事成功的條件十分充足，因為當事者缺　自信力，一遇挫折即為動搖，這是一足要失敗的，現在我們同志及國民最缺乏者，是目信力與夫勇猛刻苦的精神，尤其都市裏一般人德情形，更為痛心，大家隨波逐浪，投機取巧，生活腐化，精神萎頓，很少有打起精神，努力做成一件事的自信力。這種情形，如不設法改革，縱有好的建國機會，也是無用，所以我們要完成建國工作，必具有先烈的自信力與夫勇猛刻苦的精神，尤其在人力物力極端貧困的時候，一切缺陷都要以過强的自信力與加倍的刻苦努力，來彌補的。</p>
<p>以上數點，是我個人平素的認識與感觸，就作為紀念先烈的　詞吧·（九月一日廣播詞）</p>

<h3>自第一版轉來</h3>
<p>問：話雖這樣說，周恩來不是最近毅然決然會發表聲明攻擊重慶了麼？</p>
<p>答：周恩來的聲明，是答覆梁寒操的。梁寒操把七月二十六日國共交涉的停頓，完全歸罪於共產黨，說：「根本解決的障礙，仍然在於共產黨反覆無常的態度上，但國民黨始終是願以友誼態度與共產黨合作的」（原文如是）。於是針對這一點，周恩來就指出國民黨口是心非的一貫作風，說：「問題斛決的障礙，始終在於重慶國民黨不肯放棄獨裁的一點上。國民黨政權，完全是一黨專政，對於三民士義所規定的方針，表示一再怠工，而不願立刻實行眞正的民主政治」。周恩來聲明所以這樣强硬者，實際上決非單純因為一個共產黨在支持他。戰爭現實主義者的美國，認為凡能用於擊潰日本者，皆想加以利用，因而最近重視中國共產黨的抗戰能力，而想利用於對日發動攻勢，於是與中共業已開始軍事合作談判了。中共此時在中國，無論態度怎樣强硬，而重慶是無如之何的。重慶當局苦於應付中共，因為懼怕美國，而只好盡量與中共避免表面衝突，而採取退讓政策。中共乘重慶實行退讓政策的機會，而愈益主張重慶政權立即實現民主主義。美國並無暇考慮中共所主張的重慶政權，實現民主主義化的結局，將發生如何世界性的意義，而只是與中共搭成伙伴，齊聲吶喊，要求重慶政權的民主主義化。重慶受到這兩方面的壓迫後，最近便不得不發表人權保障和檢查緩和等一類的民主士義法案。自然，這只是裝腔作勢的一種民主主義政策，也無非是因環境逼迫不得已而然的表示。然而心中却是憤慨萬分。蔣介石會明目張胆再三聲明，在抗戰時期如不實行專制獨裁，則無法統治中國。就是單單裝腔作勢的民主主義也好，重慶不得不如此表示的原因，就是在理論上被延安戰敗所致。諸如此類的車情，都決不是促進國共合作的要素。反勿寗說，都是造成二者愈益背道而馳的要素。</p>
<p>問：你就是因此而認為蔣介石愈益接近日木了麼？</p>
<p>答：你不要性急。關於這個問題，單純考慮到中國的條件，而不考慮到日本本身的主覜條件，這是無用的。說一句老實話，日木「不即蔣」時，蔣無論受中共怎樣的挪揄，受美國怎樣的玩弄，而也不睬日本，這是不會有的事。同時，不僅這一點。而現在的中日問題，決非單純蔣介石，國粹派，親英美派等所能够決定的。關於這一點，我會在　著「全面解決中日問題的意見」一文上，會引證過前任杭州領事米內山席夫的下列語句，在此尙有一玩味的必要。「蔣介石的個人勢力，在統治着抗戰中國，這固然是事實，但同時不要忽略，蔣介石是很會吸收中國反日勢力的。抗日心理的基礎，並非是蔣介石，而是另外的一件束西。具體一點說，就是知識份子大衆的心理，再進一步說，就是民族心理……」這話說得很對。現在日本應當理睬的，不僅是中國著名的政治家，而且也是以「黃帝子孫」為無上光榮的全部中國民衆。中國目前的時代，無論蔣介石也好，毛澤束也好，都不能强制施行中國民衆所不願接受的政治了。但日本的政治家，尙未能充分瞭解這一點。只和中國的聞名政治家打交涉。例如，有些日本政治家總想和「蔣介石的母親的弟弟的侄男的姨太太的哥哥」，或「何應欽的祖父的侄男的兒子的老婆的哥哥的兒子的岳父的朋友」之類令人聞之頭痛的人事關係，來解決中日問題，或是和北洋軍關時代腐化不堪的骨董人物研究中日問題，而完全不管最主要的中國民衆是否能接受。因此，現在的中國民衆不能說對於日本政策災有良好的印象。按目前情形說，蔣介石縱然願意跑到日本方面來，但也決不能把中國民衆拖過來與日本把手眼歡。如勉强這樣作，自己即有被國民驅逐的危險，所以蔣不能來日談判和平。</p>
<p>問：我要冒昧地問一句，那末日本究竟怎樣辦好呢？</p>
<p>答：你縱然冒昧地問，但我對於這一問題，也不能冒昧地答。這一問題，你有來華親身研究的必要。歌德曾說過：「凡夫俗子不僅完全不承認自己生活以外的生活，而且要求自己以外所有的人類，都必須過與他自己相同的生活」。日本人研究這個問題時，應當細加玩味這句話。日本人首先應當站在中國人的立場上想，假如自己是中國人，在那種情形下怎辦？假定自己是中國人，在那種塲合下作何情緒？如能想到這一點，則定會稍微想像到中國人現在對於日本人所懷抱的情緒。根據這樣獲得的「中國人之情緒」而觀察事物，則就很容易瞭解中國問題的核心了。暫舉一極小的實例：假設美國軍隊在日本登陸，而美國人目空一切，雄視闊步，酗酒打人，那末日本人對於美國人將有何種感情呢？如日本人被日本人毆打了，則尙能忍耐，但這是被外人毆打了，不，是被美國人毆打了。如能理解此時此地的日本人情緒，就當然會理解中國人被日本人所毆打時的情緒。根據這樣中國人的情緒而觀察事物，就能多少把握到中國問題的中心。有許多日本人懷疑，中國人究竟為什麼那樣固執地不放棄抗日情精？日本人以為「日本旣與中國締結同盟條約，中國人就是日本人的同志，所以中國人對於日本人必須有同志的感情」。這是根據「日本人的情緒」而求得的中國人觀。根據這樣「日本人的情緒」，縱然研究中日問題一百年，也永久不能發見解決之路。</p>

        <h1>1944.09.02</h1>
<h3>My View of the Chongqing Regime (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Tosuke Yoshida</p>
<p>Question: What is Chiang Kai-shek's own opinion regarding a comprehensive peace? Based on the ideas he expressed in "China's Destiny," he seems to be a proponent of resisting Japan to the very end. It is said that he is very stubborn and has a personality of unwavering determination once he has made a decision.</p>
<p>Answer: Your opinion of Chiang Kai-shek is in danger of being superficial. Over the past seven or eight years, countless biographical accounts of Chiang Kai-shek have emerged, because anyone and everyone has picked up a pen to say a few words about Chiang Kai-shek. Most of them are filled with nauseating words of praise and flattery. If not of this type, they are attacks aimed at catering to Japanese intentions, showering him with venomous abuse. In short, both types of reviews are difficult to agree with. (For example, Sven Hedin's "Chiang Kai-shek" only expresses the fact that a great explorer of Central Asia is not necessarily a great explorer in anthropology). But the "character assessment" of Chiang Kai-shek that I admire the most is only one: that is, when Chiang Kai-shek first began slaughtering communists in Guangdong on March 20, 1926, the next month, the Guangdong Communist Party leader Stepanov submitted the following report to the Russian Communist Party. This report concerns Chiang Kai-shek's attitude towards Russia and the sudden and alarming suppression of the Communist Party... The purpose of this report is to explain several reasons for the incident. Although there are many reasons for the incident, the individual characters of the instigator, Chiang Kai-shek, and our comrades played a significant role. Therefore, a slightly more detailed description of Chiang Kai-shek is necessary. The character I am pointing out here is also jointly recognized by representatives of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In my and the Chinese Communist Party's view, Chiang Kai-shek is a special person with obvious characteristics. His most prominent nature is his ambition and desire for power. He wants to present himself as a hero to all the Chinese people. He calls himself a revolutionary, but the revolutionary he speaks of does not simply refer to a national revolutionary, but also has the meaning of a global revolutionary. However, the question is how the revolutionary term he speaks of is understood. He likes power and money. What I should point out here is that, as far as I know, the reason why he likes money is definitely not because he wants to become rich himself, but only to put on a beautiful liberal posture. He spares no expense on gifts and bribes, spending huge sums of money to seek the support of newspapers and to sing his praises. In fact, Chiang Kai-shek is very clever (Rather clever). He not only understands Chinese political problems very well, but also understands world political problems. He does not trust the masses, but is willing to accept the support of the masses. And in order to achieve his political goals, he also knows a little about how to use the masses. For the same purpose, he certainly uses us and the Chinese Communist Party, but only for the period that he needs us. Similarly, the reason why he uses the national revolutionary movement is because he wants to be a national hero. Therefore, he does not associate with people who are criticized by Chinese public opinion. This is precisely the reason why he often hesitates between the "right wing" and the Communist Party. At the same time, I believe that this is the reason why he loudly shouts that all of China is constantly disturbed by the "red peril"... (World wide Soviet Plots By N. Mitarevsty pp. 22-23)."</p>
<p>Naturally, this report was written by his political enemy, but there are not many articles that portray his characteristics so simply, clearly, profoundly, and pertinently.</p>
<p>In order to achieve his goals, he uses everything he can use. He uses England, the United States, the Soviet Union, and even Japan. He is happy to use whoever he can use. From this point of view, he is indeed firm in his will, but this cannot be called "stubbornness," because "stubbornness" means "ignorant and obtuse." On the contrary, even Chiang's enemies say that he is "very clever, he not only understands Chinese political problems very well, but also understands world political problems." In this case, he is definitely not an "ignorant and obtuse" person. He is a "person who understands at once." (When Prime Minister Inukai was attacked by thugs in the February 26th Incident, he said "I understand at once", but the thugs did not want to listen to Inukai's words, but said "No need to talk nonsense," and then shot him dead. Such people are "people who do not understand even if you talk to them").</p>
<p>He does not want to listen to Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere theory, and even if he is lured with the moving words of "the world's four great powers," he will not fall into the trap. At the same time, I believe that he also knows very clearly that it is definitely not Chongqing that will benefit from resisting Japan to the end. Therefore, this is the reason why I firmly believe that a comprehensive peace is hopeful.</p>
<p>Question: If Chiang Kai-shek and the National Essence faction, as you said, have the intention to negotiate peace with Japan, then hasn't the Chinese Communist Party seen through this long ago?</p>
<p>Answer: That's right. The difficulty of the KMT-CPC negotiations lies here. The ultimate goal of the Chinese Communist Party is naturally to build a socialist China. As long as the Chongqing regime can be used in this direction, the Chinese Communist Party values this utility and never wants to abandon it. However, the Chongqing regime will soon become completely dominated by the pro-British and American faction, or will become an economic vassal state of the United States, or will compromise with Japan - this decisive moment is gradually approaching - if so, the Chinese Communist Party is always prepared to enter a state of complete armed confrontation with Chongqing. The Chinese Communist Party's conjecture about the Chongqing regime is simply this. The situation is becoming increasingly urgent. In the near future, the Chongqing regime will have to make a final decision, either throwing itself into the arms of Japan, or joining hands with the United States, one of the two. When deciding which of the two to choose, Chiang Kai-shek, who represents national capital more than comprador capital, will definitely choose to compromise with Japan, which has a higher possibility of allowing the independent development of national capital. Because what Chiang Kai-shek fears most now is that China will become a second Mexico when the United States wins. The national capital of Mexico is completely subordinate to American financial capital. Similarly, after the war, American financial capital - just imagine its enormous power and desire to pursue profits! - will monopolize all Chinese enterprises and completely dominate China's national capital. Chiang Kai-shek is no longer afraid of Japanese financial capital monopolizing Chinese enterprises. He believes that Japan cannot conquer all of China. What he fears at this time is the post-war United States and the post-war Soviet Union. The Chinese Communist Party knows very well that Chinese national capital is afraid of the United States and the Soviet Union, and is urging Chiang Kai-shek to choose the path of compromise with Japan.</p>
<p>Question: Does the Chinese Communist Party have any drafts to deal with this point?</p>
<p>Answer: It is difficult to say what kind of drafts the Chinese Communist Party has, perhaps there is no unified plan yet. However, according to the pro-Soviet faction in Chongqing, the Chinese Communist Party seems to be building a new socialist China centered on the current Yan'an regime. After the European problem is completely resolved, the Soviet Union will have plenty of spare capacity. Therefore, the Soviet Union will not permanently maintain the current state of complete lack of voice on the Sino-Japanese issue. The pro-Soviet faction within Chongqing speculates that the Soviet Union has such intentions, and wants to ask the Soviet Union to participate when the Greater East Asia War reaches a decisive stage. At the same time, they want to use the power of the Soviet Union to establish a socialist China in northern China to confront the Chongqing regime. Does the Soviet Union agree with this idea of the pro-Soviet faction? This depends on the Soviet Union's world policy at that time. Stalin has always been a "ripe persimmon eater," so Stalin will not participate in the Greater East Asia War if the objective conditions at that time are not ripe, because he will never eat unripe persimmons no matter what. However, do not ignore that this idea has considerable influence among young members of the Chinese Communist Party and the pro-Soviet faction in Chongqing. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are older, so they are trying their best to suppress this idea. Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are unwilling to stimulate Chiang Kai-shek until the last resort. Although the middle and lower-level cadres of the Chinese Communist Party have not forgotten Chiang Kai-shek's hatred for slaughtering their comrades in Jiangxi and Shanghai, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai have transcended personal feelings and believe that as long as such a person as Chiang Kai-shek is beneficial to the national revolution, they want to use him until he can no longer be used. Regarding this point, the last sentence of the Stepanov report mentioned earlier has the following meaningful sentence:</p>
<p>"Another element is the personality of Chiang Kai-shek. As long as such an extraordinary person exists, we must naturally use all means to use him to achieve the goal of national revolution. We will not temporarily talk about how many revolutionary components Chiang Kai-shek has, or how many counter-revolutionary components he has, but we should pay attention to not throwing him out of our common cause. Because his character (if our estimate is correct) is a character that can be used in the process of national revolutionary struggle. This is not only our opinion, but also the opinion of the Shanghai Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Guangdong Committee."</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, they highly valued Chiang Kai-shek's utility value. Today, Chiang Kai-shek is the "national hero" of the anti-Japanese war in China, of course, his utility value has reached its peak. Therefore, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai are not willing to easily dismiss him. (The following turns to page four)</p>
<h3>Cutting off Supplies to the Indian Ocean Japanese Submarines Active, Sinking Several Enemy Tankers and Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>A certain base in the Indian Ocean, Central News Agency dispatch. The Indian Ocean Fleet under the command of Mountbatten is currently actively engaged in increasing its forces and receiving supplies. In order to cut off its supply lines, Japanese submarines are currently actively operating. A large Japanese submarine that returned to base on a certain day destroyed several enemy tankers and several cargo ships, totaling several tens of thousands of tons, in just a few days during its sortie.</p>
<h3>A Tanker Blown into Two Pieces</h3>
<p>On a certain day of a certain month, the submarine newly deployed to the western waters of the XXXXX archipelago to search for enemy transport ships. At 3:00 PM, it suddenly discovered enemy ship tracks. At that time, an enemy patrol boat appeared. So, it temporarily implemented submerged navigation and hid for a long time. The captain gave the order, "Enemy ships are found, track them immediately." Then, the submarine adopted an attack tactic. At that time, the captain said that the enemy ship was a 7,000-ton tanker. Soon, the distance between the two sides gradually approached. The sound room immediately ordered the launch of torpedoes. After a while, a huge sound of torpedo bombardment was heard from the other side, indicating a hit. Their screams of fear and disturbances were also heard one after another. At the same time, flames emerged from the middle of the enemy ship's stern. The Japanese submarine quickly surfaced and approached the enemy ship to continue firing at it. However, the tanker, with its strong buoyancy, did not sink immediately. They also fired back and barely fought back. The torpedoes launched by the Japanese submarine cut through the waves and made a final strike against the enemy ship. At that time, water columns surged, soaring dozens of feet high. Then, the huge warship was blown into two pieces. The stern sank into the water, and the bow created splashes in the air before gradually sinking.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Materials, Wooden Boat Sunk</h3>
<p>At about 10:00 PM on a certain day of a certain month, a giant ship in the central part of the enemy formation also fell into the Japanese encirclement. Later, in the pitch-black sea, when it was illuminated with a periscope, it was learned that the enemy ship was a 5,000-ton class cargo ship. Then, an attack was launched, firing torpedoes at the enemy ship. At that time, it was 11:30 PM. The cargo ship was hit and suffered a fire crisis. Soon after, it sent out a distress signal and soon fled quietly from the sea at the highest speed. On a certain day of a certain month, the Japanese submarine sank an enemy wooden boat of about 100 tons fully loaded with aircraft materials with three shells. Less than thirty hours later, the track of an enemy ship was found on the horizon. The speed was increased to pursue it, and its entity was inspected with a delicate large telescope. It was learned that the warship was a new 7,000-ton class oil tanker built by the British with all their scientific essence, and was slowly heading towards Ceylon Island, unaware of the Japanese military's surprise attack. At this time, the Japanese submarine quickly submerged and pursued it, and successively and fiercely launched torpedoes that were sure to hit the enemy ship. After ten seconds, twenty seconds, and thirty seconds, a huge explosion sound rang on the side of the enemy warship, indicating a hit.</p>
<h3>General Okabe Appointed as Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China, General Okamura Transferred to an Important Position</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. The Ministry of the Army announced on the 1st: Appointed General Okabe Naozaburo as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China. General Okamura, the current Supreme Commander of North China, was transferred to an important position.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. General Okamura Yasuji has served as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China since July of the 30th year of the Republic of China, succeeding General Tada Shun, and has now been in office for three years. During this period, the general made many contributions to the Greater East Asia War and the war against Chongqing, and has previously been transferred to an important position. At a time when the Japanese army is launching a new operation on the mainland and the Chinese war situation is entering a landmark stage, it is even more promising that General Okabe Naozaburo will succeed General Okamura as the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in North China and assume the important task of North China.</p>
<h3>Controlling the Raging Waves of the Arabian Sea</h3>
<p>In order to carry out a bombardment battle, the Japanese submarine quickly surfaced. The artillerymen inside the submarine immediately fired accurately at the enemy ship. The enemy ship was immediately damaged and caught fire, but because it was a newly built ship, it was difficult to sink even if it was seriously injured. After five to ten minutes, the fire became more and more intense, soaring into the air, completely reflecting the heroic posture of the Japanese submarine on the pitch-black sea. After a while, the Japanese submarine switched to submerged retreat, because submarines are easily targeted by enemy warships in enemy formations, which is very dangerous. Therefore, after the torpedoes exploded, it was confirmed that the enemy warship had sunk after the explosion sound. The enemy sank about two hours after the Japanese submarine attacked. The purpose of the Japanese submarine's crossing of the Indian Ocean and continuous hard fighting is to control the raging waves of the Arabian Sea and cut off the lifeline of British and American maritime transportation.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Raided Yesterday, Four American Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. At about 10:00 PM on August 31st, more than ten American Air Force B24 and B25 aircraft stationed in Chongqing raided Taiwan.

<h3>Rural Construction Committee to be Established Within Days Zou Jingfang Discusses the Tasks of the Rural Construction Committee</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The Rural Construction Implementation Committee is being organized and will be established in the next two or three days. The first phase of work in each experimental county will be promoted on schedule from September to December.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The Executive Yuan's Rural Construction Implementation Committee is about to be established. Chairman Zou specially issued a statement as follows: The Chinese people have long yearned for peace and stability. The government, mindful of the difficulties of the times, announced at the beginning of this year that correcting thinking, ensuring security, and increasing production would be the policy direction for this year, in order to comfort the people's hopes. We aim to strengthen our forces and consolidate our foundations on the national policy of revitalizing China, preserving Asia, and coexisting and co-prospering. All those who care about national affairs and love peace are looking forward to it and are working hard to improve it. Therefore, there is a plan to implement rural construction and select experimental counties as a plan to</p>
<p>correct the root and clear the source. It was approved by the Supreme National Defense Conference to set up a committee to preside over the matter. It has now been established on schedule and started work. This is indeed a new institution that keenly addresses the needs of the time after the return to the capital, and it is also a major turning point in the renewal of local administration. There is no better way to remedy shortcomings and save us from abuses, and it is indeed a matter of urgency. From now on, all work in the selected experimental counties, such as implementing the established national policy, organizing farmland irrigation, revitalizing education, improving group police, maintaining transportation, utilizing welfare, clearing taxes, and advocating industry, must be promoted in order, without neglecting one and losing the other, leading to partial weakness. All</p>
<p>bribery, supply, sending off and welcoming, solicitation of bribes, and the evil habits of taking advantage of opportunities to exploit, must be strictly investigated, and counties must prohibit it, and must make sure that abuses are eliminated and the atmosphere is clean, and that corruption disappears. Anyone who tries the law with his own body will be punished according to the law without any leniency. This is the initial and essential point of the work, which cannot be tolerated or ignored. The promotion and demotion of staff members shall be based on the criteria of matching their talents to their positions and assigning them to suitable positions, based solely on tests and assessments, and not subject to favoritism. On the one hand, cultivate talents and prepare them as cadres, and on the other hand, recruit celebrities to fill the role of teachers. All measures must follow the rules, so that official positions</p>
<p>will not be in danger of falling. Once the experiment in one county is reduced, it can be extended to other counties. Things will be easier and more familiar, and the results will be twice as good with half the effort. Then, time will not be wasted. Knowing the basis of this to deal with affairs, then in the future, establishing a foundation of popular cooperation, cultivating national livelihoods, increasing agricultural production, and accomplishing the goals of the holy war will all be based on this, is it not unrestrained? But the matter belongs to the beginning of the game, as if facing the depths, the responsibility is heavy and the task is difficult, and vigilance is increased. I only hope that all our internal and external workers will sharpen their sincerity, work together in harmony, be pragmatic and seek truth, and strive to make progress. With the labor of collective wisdom, we will save the decline of the countryside. When the cause of rural construction is completed, the peace of the territory can be seen,</p>
<p>The fate of the nation and the reproduction of the nation, success or failure, all depend on this, it is not only the focus of this year's administration to implement it. Now, at the beginning of the establishment of this committee, I dare to use a word to respectfully encourage the people of the country to help each other. I also hope that the wise men at home and abroad, the elders of the rural areas, and the scholars who study rural construction will not hesitate to teach and dare to correct us, so as not to live up to the earnest expectations of the government and the public. The future of this committee is almost certain.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ogata President's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Central News Agency dispatch. Japanese Information Bureau President Ogata made a statement today regarding the appointment of parliamentary officials this time, saying: The government's reform of the past provincial committee system and the establishment of parliamentary vice ministers and participating officials have been published today. The first key to gathering the total strength of the people is to actively convey public opinion, and only by raising public opinion can a complete and unyielding decisive battle system be created, so that it can cooperate with the entire nation to advance towards the goal of completing the war.</p>

<h3>Breaking Through Solid Positions, Japanese Troops Occupy Lishui, Defeating Chongqing Troops in Heavy Rain on Both Flanks</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Southern Front, Central News Agency dispatch. On August 21st, elite Japanese troops began operations from a certain base on the Zhejiang Eastern Front, breaking through the mountainous area south of Jinhua on the left and right flanks, defeating the Chongqing troops in torrential rain and advancing bravely. At 0:30 AM on the 27th, the left flank detachment broke through the solid defensive position of the 32nd Group Army and the newly编21st师 (师长罗君雕) under the 86th Army of the Chongqing troops defending Lishui County, rushed into Lishui County and completely occupied it.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Southern Front, Central News Agency dispatch. Lishui, an advanced base of the U.S. Air Force, fell into the hands of the Japanese army on August 27th. Lishui County is located at the confluence of the Hao Xi and Da Xi rivers that flow into Wenzhou Bay, and is a strategic point for transportation between Zhejiang and Fujian in the upstream area of the Lishui River. In the spring of the 31st year of the Republic of China, when the Japanese army launched the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign, it once occupied the area. Afterwards, the Chongqing and U.S. Air Forces used this as a frontline base for air raids on Japan and for destroying southern transportation routes, and expanded the airfield five miles north of the county town to prepare for the landing of medium-sized aircraft. Despite repeated bombing by the Japanese Army Air Force, they still did not give up their attempt to use it. In addition, the headquarters of the 88th Army of the 32nd Group Army of the Chongqing troops was also located in Lishui County, with the newly编21st Division assigned the responsibility of defending it. Lishui County, due to its military and economic importance, is flourishing, with a population of more than 30,000. As for its defensive facilities, there is a city wall five meters high with thousands of guns, and the intersections of the roads inside the city are also made of cement.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, Central News Agency dispatch. Chongqing telegram. The Chongqing Military Commission announced on the 30th that the war sank the second time: The Japanese troops near Hengyang launched a fierce attack on the area east of Zhumuchong in the southwest of Hengyang on the night of the 28th, and fierce fighting continued until the 29th. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the area west of Yongfeng, and there is no change in the war near Laiyang. There is also war in the south and west of Anren. The Japanese troops in the east of Zhejiang suddenly entered Lishui at dawn on the 27th from Wuyi.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Attack Wuhan, Repelled</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. On the afternoon of the 29th, at 0:50, more than 40 U.S. Air Force fighter-bombers in a large formation raided the Wuhan area. Japanese fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them. As a result, three P40 fighters and one P51 fighter were shot down. Four P40 fighters, one P51 fighter, and four B24 bombers were destroyed. The Chongqing-U.S. aircraft randomly dropped bombs into Dongting Lake and flew away. The Japanese side also lost two aircraft.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. The Japanese army's new elite fighter squadron discovered six Chongqing-U.S. fighter aircraft in the airspace 30 kilometers north of Changsha at 2:13 PM on the 30th and immediately intercepted them, shooting down three of them.</p>
<h3>Enshi and Suichuan Airfields Bombed</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army front line base, Central News Agency dispatch. On the night of the 30th, the Japanese army air squadron attacked the Chongqing army's Enshi and Suichuan airfields again with a bomber formation. One team of Japanese aircraft that raided Enshi braved the adverse weather and carried out a fierce bombing. Five small aircraft were hit and caught fire, and two small aircraft were destroyed. A total of two trucks were destroyed and six facilities were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft bomber squadron that attacked Suichuan by surprise destroyed two ground facilities. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to Thai New Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>Bangkok, Central News Agency dispatch. Japanese Ambassador Ishii hosted a banquet at his official residence on the night of the 30th to entertain members of the new Thai cabinet.

The Thai side was attended by Prime Minister Abhaiwongse and other cabinet members and government advisor Prince Thai Chamrakong. Ambassador Ishii delivered a speech at the banquet, followed by a reply from Prime Minister Abhaiwongse, expressing his gratitude to Japan for its cooperation with the new cabinet and clarifying his determination to cooperate with Japan and implement the Greater East Asia War. The atmosphere during the banquet was very pleasant.</p>
<h3>Philippine Agricultural Delegation to Visit Taiwan for Inspection</h3>

<h3>Memorial Ceremony for Martyr Heyun's National Sacrifice Held Solemnly by the Central Government</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency dispatch. The 1st was the Memorial Day for the National Sacrifice of Peaceful Anti-Communist National Construction Martyrs. The central government solemnly held a memorial ceremony. More than 300 directors of ministries and departments, high-ranking officials of various agencies, led by Chu Minyi, paid the highest respect to the spirit tablet of Martyr Heyun. They observed a moment of silence to express their condolences. The chairman presented a wreath, and the Memorial Song of Martyr Heyun was played. The ceremony was completed in solemn military music.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces Strongly Attacking Longling and Tengyue Areas</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a Chongqing Associated Press dispatch, the battle situation on the Nujiang front is as follows: After reinforcements arrived, Japanese troops launched an attack on the Chongqing army in the Longling and Tengyue areas, pursuing them near the northwest gate of Tengyue. Frontline sources indicate that a large contingent of Japanese reinforcements appears to be moving southeast from the vicinity of Mangshi. Chongqing military authorities issued a communiqué on the night of the 30th, stating that while the Japanese army is under siege by the Chongqing forces, it is simultaneously securing Longling. The reinforcing Japanese troops, launching a vigorous offensive, have opened the road through the city and occupied high ground southeast of the main Chongqing positions. According to a United Press dispatch, Japanese troops fiercely attacked Chongqing army positions eight and a half kilometers south of Longling on the 29th. The Chongqing army attempted to block the old Burma Road between Mangshi and Longling. After receiving reinforcements, the Japanese occupied high ground southeast of the main Chongqing positions, and fighting continued until midnight. Because the Chongqing forces are tenaciously defending the area, the Japanese have detoured around their positions and attacked positions south of Longling. The Chongqing army's offensive in the Tengyue area has been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Dian-Burma Front, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Japanese troops in northern Burma and the Nujiang area are employing a war of attrition, inflicting heavy losses on the Chongqing army. In approximately half a month since August 1st, the Chongqing army has abandoned 4,196 bodies in the Nujiang area alone. To investigate the Chongqing side's difficult situation, the United States has dispatched War Production Board Director Nelson and Major General Hartley to Chongqing. Zheng Dongguo has also returned to Chongqing to discuss post-war strategies with the Chongqing authorities. These facts sufficiently demonstrate the blows suffered by the Chongqing army. Moreover, the conflict between the Chongqing army and the British and American armies is intensifying. The deputy commander of the newly formed First Army of the Chongqing army and the commander of the 30th Division, which invaded Myitkyina, have made significant sacrifices but were still criticized by Stilwell and were finally transferred back to the winter area on August 3rd. Chongqing officers and soldiers deeply resent the arrogance of the American army. Furthermore, on the Yunnan-Burma border, clashes recently occurred between the Chongqing army and the British army, resulting in 80 Chongqing soldiers killed and 61 wounded. Their mutual antagonism is difficult to conceal.</p>
<h3>Growing American Influence Penetrating Deep into Chongqing</h3>
<p>A certain base in Northern Burma, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – In the mountainous region of northern Burma, the American-equipped Chongqing army, commanded by Hatcher, has continued its counter-offensive since engaging the Japanese army, despite suffering heavy losses and remaining unenlightened. This Chongqing army is entirely equipped by the United States and possesses modern, sophisticated weaponry. Initially, its strength was three divisions, but due to unfavorable combat and increased casualties, two divisions were drawn from the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, forming a total of five divisions, with the aim of opening the China-India Highway. The United States intends to control Chongqing militarily and economically by strengthening its anti-Japanese offensive base on the mainland. In military terms, the results of this operation have demonstrated that the Chongqing army is merely a sacrifice for the American army. American plans completely disregard the damage suffered by the Chongqing army, treating them and materiel equally. The Chongqing army's progress, from Hsinbyuan to Mawain, to Myitkyina, is slow, averaging only 600 meters per day, placing them in a disadvantageous position. Moreover, regardless of internal and external circumstances, the American army is currently engaged in Americanizing the Chongqing army, with the 15th Division of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force bearing the brunt. The commander of this army, Chen Cheng, strongly opposed this, but was soon dismissed by Chiang Kai-shek and replaced by Wei Lihuang. Consequently, the American army's work in Americanizing the command of this army has progressed further. Hatcher is now continuing to extend his influence to the Yunnan army centered in Kunming and the armies in the various war zones along the Yuehan Railway. With the American army's influence increasingly penetrating deep into Chongqing, generals centered around Chen Cheng are reportedly voicing strong opposition.</p>
<h3>Fighting in Northern France Closes in on the Belgian Border German Troops Withdraw from Verdun and Reims</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – A German press release, quoted by the German News Agency, states: Under heavy enemy pressure, German troops in northern France have retreated northeast to the Somme River area. The enemy has occupied Amiens (in northern France) and is advancing northeast and north. The fighting in Verdun has been particularly intense, and German troops withdrew from the area in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: German troops withdrew from Reims (northeast of Paris) in an orderly manner. There were no anti-German demonstrations by the population. The people feared bombing by Allied artillery and aircraft and mostly took refuge in cellars at night. Large groups left the city at night, heading east and north, in good order and not in a disorganized retreat. Allied tank spearheads attempted to disrupt German movements in certain sections but were defeated by German Tiger tanks. The Allies clearly intended to cut off the retreating German forces, but failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: After reinforcing its right flank southeast of Compiègne, the Allies continued their advance north. There is currently no tendency to move east into the Argonne Forest. British forces clearly intend to link up with the main body of the U.S. Third Army, which, after occupying Reims, has crossed the Laon. German forces are striking the enemy flanks and rear, inflicting heavy losses. German forces between the Oise River and the Channel coast are continuing to retreat north to avoid encirclement. British tank units are attacking fiercely between the Oise River. German counter-attacks north of Beauvais are attempting to contain the Allies, and that area has become the new focus of fighting.</p>
<h3>German Troops Moving North Along the Adriatic Coast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: On the Adriatic coast, German troops withdrew from the second line of battle on the afternoon of August 29th with minimal losses. British forces have advanced to a point 30 kilometers from the Gothic Line.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Commander Shiota Refutes False Allied Reports Exaggerated Propaganda is Absurd and Nonsensical</h3>
<p>At a joint press conference co-hosted by the Allied Army, Navy, and Foreign Ministry information authorities in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) at 3:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Chinese reporters in Shanghai were met by Lieutenant Commander Shiota, representing the Navy Information Department, and Deputy Consul Fukuma, representing Director Matsudaira of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy. Lieutenant Commander Shiota sternly refuted the enemy's exaggerated and false reports of the war situation in the Pacific. Finally, he stated that the recent three surprise attacks on Shanghai by American aircraft based in Chongqing were repelled by the local Japanese army's intense anti-aircraft fire, and there was no damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy False Reports Not Worth Laughing At</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's (the 1st) broadcast from San Francisco, the enemy falsely claimed that the fate of Japan could be determined based on the progress of the European war. The Japanese side dismisses this with a laugh. I can assert that the Japanese national character is such that the more difficulties encountered, the more fierce their fighting ability and national spirit become. This is a traditional spirit since the founding of Japan. Furthermore, regarding the Pacific war situation, Lieutenant Commander Forrestal Sherman, deputy chief of staff of the U.S. Navy's Nimitz Headquarters, stated on August 30th that the U.S. Navy had applied all its strength in the Pacific war. However, according to our observation, the only bases the enemy is currently using in the Pacific are Hawaii and Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands. Therefore, we must pay attention to future observations of the war situation and combat strength. Therefore, the claims from San Francisco and Wallace feel like first-rate false propaganda. Today, Japanese forces are continuing to fight fiercely on Omiya Island and in various naval battles in the Pacific. Except for a small part of Saipan and the Marshall Islands, the remaining vast islands of the South Seas are all under Japanese control. Therefore, the enemy's exaggerated propaganda, claiming that the Pacific war situation can be resolved, is a blatant lie and extremely misleading.</p>
<h3>Heavy Damage to American Ships</h3>
<p>Furthermore, according to what Rear Admiral Oborin, the U.S. Navy aviation staff officer, said on the 29th of last month, the U.S. Navy has a hundred aircraft carriers. Recalling the numbers initially stated by the enemy at the start of the battle of Saipan, they were also the same. Afterwards, after the fierce fighting by the Japanese army on that island, the enemy suffered heavy losses of both formal aircraft carriers and auxiliary aircraft carriers, but up to today, the numbers are still the same as before the battle of the island. This is absurd and bizarre. Based on this situation, we can conclude that the enemy relies on the superiority of numbers and does not hesitate to exaggerate and lie. In addition, the lack of understanding of combat strength and the unreasonable recklessness are extremely nonsensical. Also, the Japanese army retreated from the Kiska base in the Aleutian Islands in the last part of July, but the enemy propaganda claimed that Kiska was bombed continuously on August 10th and that the Japanese resistance was fierce, etc. However, since the retreat took place ten days earlier, there were no Japanese troops present when they landed. Therefore, the victory claimed by the United States and Canada is extremely absurd and nonsensical.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Shanghai Wasted Effort</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the feelings of Chinese youth towards the past are completely different compared to now. The representative of the department said that in the past, some Chinese youth, based on the progress of the war situation, were optimistic about the destiny of China. However, this has completely changed. It is no longer about cooperating with Britain and the United States to save the country, but only about strengthening China's own power and laying a solid foundation. Finally, it was stated that since the 8th of last month, there have been three air raids in the city. The details of the first situation have been published in detail, and the details of the second situation in the area between Shanghai and Wusong have also been published in detail. However, two days later, the enemy Stilwell claimed to have bombed the Japanese army's material accumulation area. In fact, of the bombs dropped, one fell on an abandoned field, and one damaged a broken wall of an abandoned house, measuring two meters in depth and five meters in diameter, and were not large bombs. However, during the third air raid from the evening of the 29th to 1:30 AM the next morning, enemy aircraft attempted to drop bombs in the city, but after the local garrison fired intense artillery fire, they fled in disarray. Therefore, no bombs were dropped.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Further Increases Pressure on Turkey Bulgarian Representative Arrives in Cairo to Negotiate Armistice</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Union is absolutely determined to increase pressure on Bulgaria and Turkey, simultaneously with its offensive in Romania. These countries will be forced to participate in the work of forcing the German army to withdraw from the Balkans. Bulgaria and Turkey have received this warning. The Moscow newspaper "Pravda" wrote that the Soviet Union has told Bulgaria that its passive attitude is not satisfactory to the Soviet side.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: According to news from Cairo, the capital of Egypt, a Bulgarian representative has arrived in Cairo to accept the Allied armistice terms. The news also stated that there would be no negotiation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – According to a dispatch from Sofia: The Bulgarian government, given the unstable situation in France, announced on the 30th the recall of its envoy to Vichy, Simonov.</p>
<h3>Turkish-Bulgarian Border Closed</h3>
<p>Budapest, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – Turkey and Bulgaria closed their borders on the 31st, completely halting local traffic. The return of German diplomats stationed in Turkey has also been postponed.</p>
<h3>Göring's Nephew Killed in Air Combat</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: Lieutenant Göring, nephew of German Marshal Göring, died for his country while fighting over Normandy. He is the fifth nephew of Marshal Göring to die in this German war.</p>
<h3>U.S. Production Director Travels to Chongqing via Moscow</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The German News Agency reports: According to news from London, U.S. War Production Board Director Nelson has arrived in Moscow and will continue to Chongqing after brief discussions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Break into Warsaw Encounter Strong Resistance Germans Build a Defensive Line Using Natural Barriers</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – After breaking through the Galati Pass, Soviet forces on the Romanian front invaded the Wallachian Plain in one fell swoop, reaching Ruse and engaging in fierce fighting, putting pressure on the weakened German forces. Fierce fighting has also broken out between Soviet and German forces in the area around Constanța and to the south on the Black Sea coast. According to news from Berlin, German forces launched a major offensive northeast of Warsaw with four infantry divisions and a large number of tanks, attempting to break into the city of Warsaw. However, they were met with fierce German resistance before reaching the city streets and only occupied the train station eleven kilometers northeast of Praga.</p>
<p>Budapest, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – German forces have once again entered Czechoslovakia, following the pattern of their entry into Hungary on March 19th. It is speculated that the German move is intended to create a final strong defensive line using the natural barrier of the Carpathian Mountains. It is also reported that Soviet forces advancing on Krakow from the direction of Burdaimis are preparing for a large-scale operation. German forces have strengthened their defensive line to defend the main industrial area of Silesia. After entering the Czech Republic and Hungary, the German plan is to construct an iron-clad defensive line from the Czech border to the Carpathian Mountains of Transylvania to prevent Soviet forces from invading German territory.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Writes Article Expressing Firm Belief</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) – The Hai Tong News Agency reports: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the "German Weekly," stating in brief: All the needs of German reserve troops are being met by the civilians, and various measures have been taken to meet future needs. Regarding weapons, the Allied countries surpass Germany in technology, and their advantage has not been quickly overcome, but it is undeniable that Germany is gradually gaining an advantage. A war situation more favorable to Germany is about to arrive. It would be foolish to think that using new weapons could immediately turn the war situation in Germany's favor. This decisive development requires a gradual revelation. We should be patient, and we should not expect Germany to rely solely on mysterious weapons to change the war situation. The German military's operational techniques will have a more gradual development, but the enemy will certainly feel burned out when dealing with Germany's war machine.</p>

<h3>Three Control Committees Take Over Permits for Movement Applications Other Materials Still Handled by the Business Control Committee</h3>
<p>The Business Control Committee stated that in order to strengthen material controls and solve the problem of large-scale movements of major materials, except for matters concerning flour and wheat movement permit applications, which have already been transferred to the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, the applications for permits to move the three major materials of oil, cotton (including cotton, yarn, and cloth), and daily necessities (including matches, candles, and soap), have also been transferred to the Oil, Cotton, and Daily Necessities Control Committees starting yesterday (the 1st). In addition, applications to move other major materials should still be submitted to the Material Movement Permit Application Office of the Business Control Committee.</p>
<h3>Flour Allocation Offices Established in Various Regions</h3>
<p>The Flour and Wheat Control Committee of the Business Control Committee, in order to meet the needs of the people's food supply, has specially established flour allocation offices in various major regions in accordance with Article 2 of the Interim Measures for the Allocation of Manufactured Products. The two offices in Suzhou and Nanjing are now actively being prepared for readiness. Allocation offices in other areas such as Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and Wuhu are also in the process of being prepared.</p>
<h3>Customs Rectifies Discipline Strictly Prevents Customs Officers from Engaging in Malfeasance Welcomes Outside Exposure and Whistleblowing</h3>
<p>Responsible personnel of the Customs Line Tax Department issued a statement yesterday, saying: "The customs authorities have recently received letters from outside exposing customs officers for engaging in malfeasance. The Shanghai Times newspaper on the first of this month also published similar letters, demonstrating that all sectors attach importance to customs administration, which is worthy of acknowledgment. The content of the letters has been strictly reviewed and investigated. However, because the letters lack accurate addresses and genuine names, it is difficult to conduct investigations and seek evidence. However, during the period of rectifying discipline, we have taken various effective measures to prevent malfeasance, such as organizing patrol teams to conduct thorough searches and recently issuing a notice to merchants at the Jianghai Customs Office that if goods are detained, they must obtain a detention receipt. If officials refuse to issue receipts, they are allowed to be reported by name. These measures have already shown results. However, the customs checkpoints are scattered in the suburbs, and intelligence personnel have mixed ears and eyes. To eliminate corruption, it is related to the administration of this office, and exposing cases relies on external assistance. We welcome whistleblowing in the future. However, whistleblowers must provide accurate addresses and genuine names to facilitate investigation and consultation. The Customs will absolutely keep the names of whistleblowers confidential, so there is no need to worry. However, if there is fabrication or intentional slander, this office will also investigate according to the law to maintain honor."</p>

<h3>Rice Control Committee Downsizes Staff More Than Sixty People</h3>
<p>After the reorganization of the Rice Control Committee, personnel adjustments were made through a selection process. The results have been announced, and the first batch of layoffs was notified separately yesterday (September 1st), including 15 commissioners, 2 inspectors, 4 secretaries, and more than 60 clerks and assistants.

<h3>Bicycle License Exchange Strictly Prevents Malfeasance</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau began processing bicycle license exchanges in the city on the 15th of last month. The number of people going to register every day has been extremely enthusiastic. In order to assist in preventing bicycle theft, the authorities have been very strict with inspecting the steel stamps on bicycles. Owners have to spend time waiting for the inspection. A small number of owners, unable to wait, asked intermediaries to handle the procedure on their behalf. It is unreasonable for those who arrive first to have to wait longer. In view of this, the bureau specially dispatched personnel on the 26th of last month to assist in inspecting the steel stamps at various registration offices. It has also contacted the Finance Bureau to send personnel to the registration offices to jointly collect and remit funds in order to expedite the process. The bureau also sends personnel to the registration offices at any time to check whether there is any difficulty or overcharging of citizens. Once discovered, severe punishment will be given. It has been learned that the authorities recently discovered three employees accepting bribes and have already dismissed them, hoping</p>
<h3>Police Officer Commits Extortion by Intimidation and Illegal Detention Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Zhang Deshi, an investigator in the Judicial Section of the Xujiahui Sub-bureau, together with Cai Linshan and Meng Zhenshan, street vendors selling bread, went to the home of Jin Ronggui, a tailor residing at No. 19, Weifu Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi, on July 34th. They claimed that someone named Wang had been detained and that Wang had testified that he was related to Jin. They took Jin to a tea house in Nanshi and, through intimidation, extorted 4,000 yuan from him before releasing him. Cai received 600 yuan in "hat money," and Meng received 200 yuan in "hat money." Zhang misappropriated the remaining 3,200 yuan. Afterwards, Jin Ronggui, unable to bear this undeserved injustice, filed a report with the Yimiao Sub-bureau, which reported it to the Judicial Department. Director Li ordered the Investigation Section to investigate. Section Chief Liu's investigation confirmed the facts. Zhang was detained, and the two suspects, Cai and Meng, were apprehended. After interrogation, all suspects confessed to the crime. They were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and legal questioning on charges of extortion by intimidation under Article 346, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the same law. In addition, Zhang was charged with abuse of authority as a public official.</p>

<h3>Short Commentary: The Issue of Electricity Restrictions for Theaters</h3>
<p>The restrictions on water and electricity in this city, particularly the repeated restrictions on theaters, are undoubtedly necessary from the authorities' perspective. From the users' perspective, there is also an absolute obligation to comply. However, there should be two different distinctions in the amount of restrictions: Pure consumers should be limited to the bare minimum, while wasters should be absolutely prohibited. Production departments of wartime necessities, wartime essential work departments, and public welfare departments should be moderately maintained to the necessary extent. We believe that the authorities will also consider this distinction, and not treat them equally. The recent electricity usage survey of factories by the Economic Bureau, and the Ministry of Industry's plan to adjust electricity usage for Shanghai factories, are examples of this.</p>
<p>As for social welfare departments, such as hospitals that use electricity for surgical tools, cannot be reduced. This fact should be carefully considered, and the necessary usage should be maintained as much as possible. Recently, we have received many letters from hospitals explaining the reasons why they cannot reduce electricity usage. However, the power company has not considered the actual needs and will implement power cuts according to the restrictions, causing considerable difficulties for medical care and patients.</p>
<p>Based on the principle of reasonable differentiation in electricity restrictions, we believe that the necessary electricity usage for hospitals in medical care should not be treated the same as consumer waste. We hope that the electricity authorities will consider this carefully and make reasonable adjustments to benefit public welfare.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth reiterating a method for conserving electricity that we mentioned in our commentary on March 9th: "During the middle ten days of each month - from the eighth to the eighteenth - when the moonlight is bright (except on rainy days), the streetlights on the roads, even at their dimmest, are almost imperceptible under the moonlight. During this period, it would be better to eliminate streetlights and transfer the electricity saved to supplement the electricity shortages in livelihood and public utilities." Such wanton behavior has been rampant these past few years, especially since joining the Greater East Asia War. The allies’ assistance can be described as supremely benevolent and righteous, and the people's tolerance and expectations for the government have reached their limit. Thinking of this today, the martyred heroes certainly have no reason to be ashamed of the nation, nor does the nation have reason to be ashamed of the martyred heroes. However, we comrades who survive them have let down the heroes and the nation too much.</p>
<p>At present, the peace movement, due to the intricate complexity of subjective and objective conditions, has nearly despaired of achieving comprehensive peace. However, the goal of the peace movement is to save the country, and its process requires achieving comprehensive peace before the wish to save the country can be realized. Based on this principle, no matter how tortuous the path to comprehensive peace may be, we must bravely move forward and not stop until we reach our goal.</p>
<p>Once we understand our goal, we should uphold the spirit of the martyrs and strive forward along the normal path. Therefore, I hope that my comrades who live on will: First, uphold the spirit of "public-mindedness and selflessness" to seek political reform. When it comes to comprehensive peace, most people pay attention to military developments. Naturally, when the Chongqing authorities still believe in final victory, military developments are important. However, political struggle is more effective and significant because comprehensive peace is not peace for a few leaders, but peace for the entire nation; it is not peace of submission or coercion, but peace of inner awakening. The greatest driving force for achieving this kind of peace is enlightened politics within the peace zone because enlightened politics can stabilize people's lives and reduce unnecessary suffering. Although the people's knowledge is low, their perception of politics is very keen. They don't care about war and peace, they don't feel enthusiastic about Pan-Asianism, and they don't understand the ABCD line. If someone can help them to settle down or reduce their suffering, they will not care if the government is A or B, and they will rush to praise it, saying, "This is our benevolent heaven." If 300 million out of the 450 million people turn to the peace zone, how can comprehensive peace not be achieved?</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the peace movement, we have only seen military struggles, ideological struggles, and economic struggles, but not political competition. On the contrary, we only see some officials becoming increasingly shameless, social order becoming increasingly chaotic, right and wrong becoming increasingly blurred, and people's lives becoming increasingly miserable. In this situation of political corruption, social degradation, and people struggling to survive, it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive peace based on the people.</p>
<p>I realize that the reason for all this corruption and degradation is nothing more than the prevalence of "selfishness." Therefore, we must first uphold the spirit of "public-mindedness and selflessness" of the martyrs to seek political reform. As the saying goes, "Severe punishment is needed in chaotic times." This sentence comes from painful experience. We should use resolute and selfless means to eliminate all corrupt officials, so that politics can gradually get on track, people's lives can gradually become stable, and people's hearts can return. No external force can stop this.</p>
<h3>Fight the Reactionary Forces With a Spirit of Defying Death</h3>
<p>Second, we must fight the reactionary forces of the Communist Party with the spirit of defying death of the martyrs. Based on their distorted theories, the Communist Party insists on destroying the existing social order and disintegrating the existing national organization. In a backward, semi-feudal agricultural society, they create mutual killings among people to replace the so-called class struggle. All our citizens must consider the survival of the nation and the country, and must not be indifferent to or ignore the existence and development of the Communist Party. Some people say: It is not uncommon for several parties to exist in one country. Why can't they coexist peacefully, and why must we fight to the death? Little do they know that the parties in other countries are ordinary political parties. They do not have a complete plan to transform society, they do not need to overthrow the entire old political system, they do not have armies, and they do not need to seize power by force. Their advances and retreats are based on democratic methods. The Chinese Nationalist Party is a revolutionary party, and the Chinese Communist Party also claims to be a revolutionary party. Both want to build a new society, both have military forces, and both want to seize power. A country can only have one regime. Now, the Nationalist Party has taken power and will not let go, and the Communist Party wants to steal it. In this situation, if the two parties don't have guns, they will fight with fists. Since both sides have military forces, what way is there to avoid war? Take Chongqing as an example. In order to maintain a united front with the Communist Party, they try to seek compromise. Now, the friction in their bones not only cannot be reduced, but even the superficial compromise is almost impossible. Therefore, I believe that the Nationalist Party's anti-communism is determined by the Nationalist Party's fate, and the anti-communism of patriotic people is determined by the patriotic people's duty. We cannot escape this unfortunate fate and duty, nor do we need to escape it. Therefore, we can only fight to the end with the Communists with the spirit of the martyrs who defied death.</p>
<h3>Complete National Construction With Courage and Hard Work</h3>
<p>Third, we must have the self-confidence of the martyrs and complete the construction of the country with courage and hard work. If we want to overcome a certain obstacle and complete a certain great undertaking, it depends on our self-confidence. For example, if the conditions for success are not met, but the person involved has strong self-confidence and works especially hard, it may be possible to succeed. Conversely, if the conditions for success are fully sufficient, but the person involved lacks self-confidence and wavers at the slightest setback, this is bound to fail. What our comrades and people lack most now is self-confidence and the spirit of courage and hard work, especially the situation of the general public in the city, which is even more heartbreaking. Everyone drifts with the tide, speculates and takes shortcuts, lives a corrupt life, and is mentally exhausted. There are very few who have the self-confidence to muster their spirits and work hard to accomplish something. If this situation is not reformed, even if there is a good opportunity to build the country, it will be useless. Therefore, if we want to complete the work of building the country, we must have the self-confidence and the spirit of courage and hard work of the martyrs, especially in times of extreme poverty of manpower and resources, and all shortcomings must be compensated for with excessive self-confidence and redoubled hard work.</p>
<p>The above points are my personal understanding and feelings, and I will use them as a memorial to the martyrs. (Broadcast speech on September 1)</p>
<h3>Special Scholarship Amounts Have Been Approved; Complaint Letters Must Include Procedures</h3>
<p>The scholarship office of this newspaper, entrusted by enthusiastic people from all walks of life to handle special scholarships, has a total of twelve cases, including five newly established ones: the Ai Ju Wen Zhu Ren Scholarship, the Mayor Scholarship, and the Zi Yun, Shou Zhi, and Zhuo Zai Scholarships. The handled scholarships include seven types: Bai Zhi, Yu Wen, Da Hua, Da Cheng, Ting Xin, Fu Sheng, and Ding Jun. The number of recipients and the departments they attend are all pre-designated by the donors and reviewed by this office. Those with both excellent character and academics are included in the special scholarship list. The list has been mostly finalized and will be announced tomorrow. We hope that all scholarship recipients will pay attention.</p>
<p>This office has recently received complaint letters, and some are similar to anonymous letters with the intention of sabotage and do not include real names. This office believes that they do not meet the procedures and will not handle them. In the future, if anyone reports accurate situations, please include your real name, address, and evidence. We will consider them.</p>
<h3>Health Checkup Must Be Attended</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Hospital is conducting physical examinations for the students in the primary school group of this newspaper's scholarship program, entirely free of charge, saving time and money. This newspaper has arranged a schedule and issued free examination certificates along with the scholarship checks, one certificate for each person, and instructed them to attend the examination on the scheduled date. According to the Nanyang Hospital, some students are either late, interfering with other people's examination schedules, or do not attend at all, not caring about their own health and failing to live up to the hospital's good intentions, which is regrettable. Knowing whether or not their bodies are healthy affects their studies. If the students do not participate in this examination, their qualifications will be revoked in the next application. Therefore, we hope that all students will attend the examination on time.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Scholarship Received</h3>

<p>On Behalf of Opinions</p>
<h3>Continued from Page 1</h3>
<p>Q: Granted, but hasn't Zhou Enlai recently issued a statement vehemently attacking Chongqing?</p>
<p>A: Zhou Enlai's statement was in response to Liang Han Cao. Liang Han Cao attributed the breakdown of the negotiations between the Nationalists and Communists on July 26 entirely to the Communist Party, stating that, "The obstacle to a fundamental resolution still lies in the Communist Party's capricious attitude, but the Nationalist Party is consistently willing to cooperate with the Communist Party in a friendly manner" (as originally stated). In response to this point, Zhou Enlai pointed out the Nationalist Party's consistently duplicitous behavior, stating that, "The obstacle to resolving the issue lies consistently in the Chongqing Nationalist Party's unwillingness to abandon dictatorship. The Nationalist Party regime is entirely a one-party dictatorship, and it repeatedly neglects the guidelines stipulated by the Three Principles of the People, unwilling to immediately implement genuine democratic politics." The reason Zhou Enlai's statement was so forceful is not simply because a Communist Party supports him. The war realist United States believes that anything that can be used to defeat Japan should be utilized, and thus recently it has valued the Chinese Communist Party's ability to resist Japan and has been seeking to use it to launch offensives against Japan. Thus, military cooperation negotiations with the CCP have already begun. At this time, no matter how forceful the CCP's attitude may be in China, Chongqing has no recourse. The Chongqing authorities are troubled by dealing with the CCP, because they fear the United States, and can only try to avoid surface conflict with the CCP as much as possible and adopt a policy of concession. Seizing the opportunity of Chongqing's policy of concession, the CCP increasingly advocates that the Chongqing regime immediately realize democracy. The United States has no time to consider what global implications may arise from the CCP's advocated realization of democracy of the Chongqing regime, and is simply partnering with the CCP, shouting in unison, demanding the democratization of the Chongqing regime. After being pressured by these two sides, Chongqing recently had no choice but to publish democratic legal acts of the class of human rights protections and inspection alleviation. Naturally, this is only a pretense of democratic politics, and is nothing more than an unwilling expression forced by the circumstances. However, it is filled with anger in its heart. Jiang Jieshi has openly and repeatedly stated that if he does not implement autocratic dictatorship during the war of resistance, he will be unable to rule China. Even just a pretense of democracy, the reason that Chongqing had to express it is because it was theoretically defeated by Yan'an. Such situations are definitely not elements that promote Nationalist-Communist cooperation. On the contrary, they are elements that are increasingly creating two paths diverging from each other.</p>
<p>Q: Is that why you believe that Jiang Jieshi is increasingly approaching Japan?</p>
<p>A: Don't be impatient. Regarding this question, it is useless to simply consider China's conditions without considering Japan's own subjective conditions. To put it bluntly, if Japan did "not approach Jiang," Jiang would not pay attention to Japan no matter how much the CCP ridiculed him or how much the United States played with him. At the same time, it's not just that. The current Sino-Japanese issue cannot be decided solely by Jiang Jieshi, the National Essence faction, the pro-British and American faction, etc. Regarding this point, I previously cited the following statement by the former Hangzhou Consul, Minaiyama Seibu, in my essay "Opinions on a Comprehensive Resolution of the Sino-Japanese Issue," which still has a need for careful consideration. "It is certainly a fact that Jiang Jieshi's personal influence is ruling resistance China, but at the same time, do not neglect that Jiang Jieshi is very good at absorbing Chinese anti-Japanese forces. The foundation of the anti-Japanese sentiment is not Jiang Jieshi, but something else. To put it more concretely, it is the psychology of the intellectual masses, and to go a step further, it is the national psychology..." This is well said. Now Japan should pay attention not only to famous Chinese politicians, but also to the entire Chinese populace who regard being "descendants of the Yellow Emperor" as supreme glory. In the current era of China, neither Jiang Jieshi nor Mao Zedong can forcibly implement politics that the Chinese populace is unwilling to accept. However, Japan's politicians have not yet fully understood this point, and only deal with China's famous politicians. For example, some Japanese politicians always want to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue with painful-to-hear personal relations like "Jiang Jieshi's mother's brother's nephew's aunt's husband's brother," or "He Yingqin's grandfather's nephew's son's wife's brother's son's father-in-law's friend," or study the Sino-Japanese issue with corrupted and unbearable antique figures from the Beiyang warlord era, completely ignoring whether the most important Chinese populace can accept it. Therefore, the current Chinese populace cannot be said to have a good impression of Japanese policies. According to the current situation, even if Jiang Jieshi is willing to run to the Japanese side, he definitely cannot drag the Chinese populace over to join hands and be happy with Japan. If he forcibly does this, he is in danger of being expelled by the people, so Jiang cannot come to Japan to negotiate peace.</p>
<p>Q: I want to ask boldly, then how exactly should Japan do well?</p>
<p>A: Even if you ask boldly, I cannot answer this question boldly. For this question, it is necessary for you to come to China to study it in person. Goethe once said: "The common man not only completely denies life outside his own life, but also demands that all of humanity outside himself must live the same life as he does." When the Japanese study this question, they should carefully consider this sentence. The Japanese should first stand in the position of the Chinese and think, if they were Chinese, what would they do in that situation? Assuming they were Chinese, what emotions would they have in that situation? If they can think of this, they will definitely slightly imagine the emotions that the Chinese currently harbor towards the Japanese. Observing things based on such an acquired "Chinese emotion" will easily lead to understanding the core of the Chinese issue. To give a very small example: Suppose American troops landed in Japan, and the Americans looked down on everyone, strutted around, and got drunk and beat people. What kind of feelings would the Japanese have towards the Americans? If the Japanese were beaten by the Japanese, they could still endure it, but this is being beaten by foreigners, no, being beaten by Americans. If you can understand the emotions of the Japanese at this time and in this place, you will naturally understand the emotions of the Chinese when they are beaten by the Japanese. Observing things based on such Chinese emotions can give you some grasp of the center of the Chinese issue. Many Japanese suspect, why are the Chinese so stubbornly unwilling to give up their anti-Japanese sentiments? The Japanese think that, "Since Japan and China have concluded an alliance treaty, the Chinese are Japanese comrades, so the Chinese must have comrade emotions towards the Japanese." This is the Chinese view obtained based on "Japanese emotions." Based on such "Japanese emotions," even if you study the Sino-Japanese issue for a hundred years, you will never find a way to resolve it.</p>

<h3>National Forum: The Dual Numbering System Urgently Needs to Be Abolished</h3>
<p>— Xu Keyuan</p>
<p>I live in the western part of Shanghai (formerly Zha Bei District). The number on my house seems to be the same as the house number on the property tax bill, but it has always been based on the white plaque (nailed up by the old municipal government). Every time citizens collect their ration cards, the staff at the distribution office always ask the citizens in detail about their addresses. Citizens often have difficulty receiving ration cards because they don't remember the number on the white plaque (i.e., the number on the property tax bill), which causes disputes. This fact is enough to show that the above-mentioned house number problem needs to be improved urgently. I wonder if the municipal authorities have paid attention to it or if there is already a concrete solution.</p>
<h3>Social Services: Johnson Chemical Factory's Profit Sharing Benefits Charity</h3>
