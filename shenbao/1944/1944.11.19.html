<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>寫在台菲海戰之後</h3>
<p>— 季仁</p>
<p>問：敵美在台灣菲律賓兩次海戰中，遭受到空前的損害，這是衆所周知的事實。但是，最近美國在雷伊泰島登陸的軍隊，逐漸增多；同時，海軍方面，也有機動部份游弋海面，大有蠶然思動之勢，試問這種行動對於戰局前途的影響如何？</p>
<p>答：敵美在台菲海戰中，主力機動部隊受到致命打擊，尼米茲艦隊殲滅過半，可謂開戰以來最大的損失。但是，美國在海戰之前，早抱犧牲決心，所以不惜策動其有力的海軍部隊，以與日本挑戰。敵美海軍的戰略，一方面準備引誘盟邦主力艦隊，與之一決雌雄，另一方面希望在菲律賓中部登陸以後，作爲中太平洋的據點，以圖遮斷日本與南太平洋之間的聯絡，此次美國海軍機動部隊所以不惜重大犧牲作此妄動，其目的亦即在此。可是美國的戰略如此，日本則不然。日本作戰的方略，是在如何消耗美國海軍，如何殲滅美國海軍，藉以把握最良的決戰機會。所以日本對於美國陸軍的行動，可以不加注視，其主要目標仍在海軍。過去大宮，塞班諸島的壯烈犧牲，並不是日本輕視數島的得失，乃是因爲數島之得失並不影導戰事大局，其根本原因還在殲滅美國海軍主力的時機未到。今美國在雷伊泰島登陸的陸軍部隊共增至七師團之多，在美國認爲是作戰有利，前途有望，其實美國的陸軍愈是增强，對於美國海軍愈爲不利，被殲滅的機會亦愈多。雷伊泰島登陸部隊增强到七師團後，必須要有大批的彈藥·武器·食糧·藥品等不斷的源源接濟，此時所需要的運轍船舶，將益爲增多。現在假定接濟一師團軍隊所需的船舶爲三十萬噸的話，則接濟七師團軍隊所需的船舶將至少爲二百萬噸以上。二百萬噸的運輸船隊，必須擁有大批的巡洋艦和驅逐艦來加以護衛，但巡洋艦與驅逐艦缺少戰鬥力，所以必須再加以主力艦和航空母艦增强戰鬥力，此時大批海軍部隊的出現菲律賓近海，對於美國是絕大危險，同時美國海軍愈是接近菲律賓本土，遭遇日本海空軍攻擊的機會也愈多，其危險性也愈大。上次美國海軍的慘敗，也是因爲這個緣故；今後的海面大戰，仍必繼續發生，不久的將來，又可看到美國艦隊的厄運了。</p>
<p>問：但是，美國軍隊的背後，還擁有强大的生產力，美國艦隊雖然遭受重大打擊，但是它仍能利用强大的生產能力，來與日本繼續作戰的，尊意以爲如何？</p>
<p>答：美國的全國生產力，的確不可輕視，但是，今日的戰爭，並不單是物資的戰爭，也不單是數量的戰爭，還有最重要最不可缺的主要原動力，乃是精神要素。敵美人民因薰陶於自由享樂的環境之中，對於個人的利害特別重視，所以在戰塲上，往往祇能消耗其大量武器和彈藥，而視其一已之生，有如泰山之重；而日本國民一向以刻苦耐勞聞世，惟其能刻苦，所以能輕視個人的生命，也惟其能耐勞，所以能替國家擔任興亡的重任。此次台菲海戰中，日本航空特別攻擊隊所以能以驚天地泣鬼神的壯烈「肉彈」戰法，與美國艦隊同歸於盡，終能收獲了龐大戰果，確立絕對不敗的態勢，其原因應完全歸諸日本國民「捨己爲國」的精神。所以我說：精神爲上，物質次之。</p>
<p>問：不過，來日方長，戰爭的前途將如何發展？戰爭的趨勢是否必對日本有利？</p>
<p>答：偉大的事業決不成於一朝，同樣，最後的光榮是須在艱苦萬端之中求來的。祇有堅忍不拔百折不撓的精神，纔是事業的唯一要素。長期教爭途中中，勝固不足驕，敗亦不必餒，唯有在最後的一次決戰中，勝敗方能自明。我們可以預料，美國艦隊將再興師來犯，將來不論在菲律賓，台灣，及其他海面，必再發生較此次海戰更大規模更爲激烈的海戰。不過，敵美艦隊離根據地愈遠，作戰上的不利愈甚，對於日本也更爲有利。將來日美海戰雖然不致在對馬海峽發生，但我們可斷定敵美艦隊必將與波羅的海艦隊同樣的遭受到悲慘的命運。</p>

<h3>被俘敵美空軍　述襲京經過</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　俘虜之敵美航空員，現已護送來京，記者特往走訪其中之一，談話如次：（問）請略述此次出征時之情形。（答）十一月九日正午，吾等自印度基地出發，於是日下午七時，飛抵成都附近，十一日上午二時，再行出發轟炸日本。出發後經過相當時間，因氣候惡劣，遂改變原定行動，轟炸南京。（問）出發時隊長曾有訓示否？（答）並無明顯之訓示，因吾等皆爲天主敎徒，故出發前，全體集合一處，作祈禱後，即領取地圖及航空照片，準備出發。（問）到達南京上空時之狀况如何？（答）吾等皆由指導官引導，並不知何處爲南京，但不久日軍高射砲似已開始射擊飛機之前後左右，前後皆是砲彈之炸裂。（問）B29。型機前宣傳爲絕對不落者，究竟有何優點？（答）以前對此尚相當信任，但最近在北九洲曾被擊落多架，吾等對於其性能已有疑問。（問）中彈時之狀况如何？（答）如今想起宛如夢境，蓋吾開　投彈後，炸彈才離飛機，即感到猛烈之推動，最初以爲係所投下炸彈之爆炸聲，其後始知判斷錯誤。原來係日軍之高射砲彈，擊中所投下之炸彈，因而爆烈所致，此誠爲一奇蹟。其後不久，吾等由右側面窗口向外看，即見右翼之一座引擎已經起火，當即與他機連絡，吿知本機發生火災。其後不久，右翼之兩座引擎停止活動，機身向右傾斜，火勢更烈，繼之左冀亦復起火燃燒，遍及全機，飛機全身分離。此時傳聲管恐亦發生障碍，故未聞以降落傘降落之命令。死之命運迫近吾等，吾等乃排除一切障碍，隨一秒一秒之時間，以降落傘降下，自降落傘張開後，至被日軍俘虜，其情形已記淸楚，現雖然被俘，較歸去爲佳。（問）汝等之轟炸幾屬盲炸，多數無辜中國市民無辜犧牲，汝等前言吾等爲天主敎徒，在出發前皆作祈禱，所　天主敎徒，對於盲炸殺害無罪者，有何感想？（答）此純屬不得已而爲之，吾等奉令轟炸，不知其結果，中國平民之被炸死，吾等皆不得已，此外又有何言。</p>

<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　蘇駐美大使館發表蘇聯外交六原則如次：（一）不論政體如何，各國維持和平關係。（一）與主張主能平等及獨立之各國，作政治上協力。（一）對侵路行動，於防衛目的下，可與任何國家締結同盟。（一）對在他國犧甡下之帝國主義膨脹政策，決予排除之。（一）不干涉他國內政。（一）爲對法西斯之侵略國家，決與愛好自由之各國繩化聯合。</p>
<h3>傾舉六軍全力　總攻齊格斐綫　激戰在三焦點進行中</h3>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　艾森霍華十六日已將最後豫備兵力之美第九軍派赴戰綫，德方預料之反成爲事實，於由荷蘭海岸達瑞士國境蜿蜒七百公里之戰綫，終已展開大攻防戰。現全戰綫之焦點，係爲梅茲·亞琛·文羅三地區，綜觀戰局概況如次：（一）法軍雖自瑞士國境以薩爾勃羅根爲目標開始攻擊，然其目的係在經由貝爾福·牟魯斯於瑞士之猶拉與瓦鳩中間，抵達萊因河，以掩護英軍主力及攻擊西綫中央之德軍，此事已甚明顯美第七軍與法軍並行對瓦　山脈直接開始攻擊。（一）巴頓指揮下之美第三軍雖對梅茲作集中攻擊，但其目標係在集結超重兵器，以突破德軍防衛綫，經薩爾抵達瑪因河口，該軍北翼更集結繩大兵力，（一）英第二軍與美軍攻勢緊密連擊，於文羅地區開始攻勢，於最北冀配有加拿大軍。由上述之淸勢觀之，艾森霍華對齊格斐防綫之攻擊，已傾其所有之六軍全部力量，然反軸心軍絕難達成所期目的，蓋決定戰局上最大因素之時間已見遲晚矣。</p>
<p>北翼戰事迫近科隆</p>
<p>里斯本十八日中央社電　反軸心軍現正猛攻德重工業心臟部科隆，傳已突入斯特拉斯堡及加爾斯盧罕地區。據倫敦報稱，美第一及第九軍現於科隆南方的三十公里地點激戰中，傳已進抵距猶利希·科隆平原交通要衝七公里之地點。</p>
<p>費神同千架猛烈轟炸</p>
<p>柏林十八日中央社電　海通社訊：美第九軍在亞琛區之新攻勢，乃藉飛行氣候轉佳而發動。此次進攻先用千餘架轟炸機爲前導，然後由步兵與坦克車展開進攻。秋季氣候常有利於反軸心軍，對德守軍則不利，且本年大陸上多雲霧，故德機起飛與降落故感不易，而英倫三島則氣候淸朗，故英機能常至歐陸。</p>
<h3>歐洲局勢　將有新發展　羅斯福對記者闡明戰況</h3>

<h3>神風特別攻擊隊　菲島洋面建立奇功　敵美太平洋艦隊化爲藻屑</h3>
<p>使驕傲的敵美艦隊化爲太平洋藻層的日子，終於來了。十月二十五日，日本海軍對菲島東方海面的敵美殘存艦隊主力，突然開始海空一體的猛攻。早就在心中期待這樣的一天，祈神拜佛，盼望它快些到來，現在果然來了。此日的感慨興奮，誰能忘記呢？在數日以前，睥睨大空，浩嘆沒有敵機的海軍飛行隊員們，現在却駕駛如雲似霞的精銳機，勇躍前往滅敵了。</p>
<p>這一天，菲律賓一帶的天氣，恰在久雨之後放晴。今日是可以實行攻擊了。日以繼夜地集結起來的友軍飛機，在總攻擊即將揭幕以前，經整備人員不休不眠的努力，一切準備都巳完畢。擊滅敵軍的第一彈，由海軍航空部隊的先制攻擊而射了出去。目標是敵方的航空母艦羣。侵入雷伊泰灣，在塔克羅班附近強行登陸的敵軍，爲了掩護這支上陸的軍隊，在菲島建立強力橋頭堡，他們正動員了殘存艦隊的全力。解決了這方面敵軍的空軍之後，始可在我方的制空權下，充分發揮艦隊的威力，所以菲島基地海軍航空部隊所負的任務，委實重大。一待總攻擊的命令下來，便機聲隆隆地相繼飛離基地。</p>
<p>海軍航空除員都抱着必死的決心。其中神風特別攻擊隊尤爲日本海軍的精華，這護國神鷲之名，應該永遠銘記。他們以肉彈進攻的無畏精神連人帶機一同撞向敵方航空母艦。一度飛出基地，發見敵美機動部隊時，他們便不再歸來了。這種決死的特別攻擊隊，正是前綫航空部隊的主軸，是爲了負起祖國存亡重任而組織成功的，他們是久經訓練的空中敢死隊。</p>
<p>「站在全體國民的先頭而出征，永久保衛祖國光榮歷史的，就是咱們。帝國海軍的傳統，今日非發揮一下不可。」抱着如此信念的海軍靑年飛行員，全身沸騰着熱血。親蒞神風特別攻擊隊基地的指揮官，深深爲靑年飛行員的悲壯心情所感動，聲淚俱下地致訓詞時，靑年壯士們連眉毛也不動一動。</p>
<p>鎭靜如常</p>
<p>二十五日，總攻擊的時機已到。特別攻擊隊的靑年勇士們，仰觀放晴的太空輕快地說這：</p>
<p>「今日一定幹啦！」</p>
<p>「多多拜託！」一邊說，一邊熱烈地握握整備員的手。這裏那裏，到處都有歡聲。過後，祗見大家互相默默然舉手致敬。</p>
<p>在這出發作敢死攻擊的當兒，不料大家都有這種靜默的態度，就因爲在遙遠的故國，有年老的父母，也有今春剛結婚的嬌妻。那末，這批靑年飛行員們，現在心中是在想些什麼呢？在隆隆的機聲裏，記者凝視着爬進愛機去的靑年勇士，他們口角緊閉，可以看出斷然的決心。臉上且浮着寗靜的微笑。淡淡然，照常動作。一待成爲機上人時，海軍航空隊員的頭腦中，除出擊沈敵人航空母艦的念頭以外，便什麼也沒有了。</p>
<p>焦急待捷</p>
<p>飛機的引擎聲爽脆地轟隆着。飛機沿着滑走路，平穩地飛起，一架又一架。壯士們有些揮着手向地上人員告別，有些一心一意操縱着座機。他們全體在基地上空組成編隊。這支神風特別攻擊隊的第一次攻擊隊，於是消失於碧空的那方。之後，已過了幾個鐘頭。如果沒有發見敵人，那末已是應該歸敵軍航空母艦了。於是基地上頓時嘈雜起來。</p>
<p>發見了之後，又將怎樣呢？痛快地幹下了，那當然最好，萬一受阻於敵方的防禦砲火，不能命中航空母艦，那末年靑壯的死不是太可惜了嗎？這時大家不免憂悉起來了。</p>
<p>任務完成</p>
<p>可是，這天下午，却從別的基地傳來了友軍飛機目擊的報告，情形是這樣的：</p>
<p>「第一次特別攻擊隊，在斯魯安到〇〇度〇〇　的海面，發見敵美機動部隊，二機侖中航空母艦，擊沈；一機侖中航空母艦，使之起火（敵方航空母艦陷於不能航行）；一機命中巡洋艦，擊沈。」</p>
<p>啊，多悲壯！這不是炸彈侖中了敵艦，而是連人帶機侖中了敵艦。第一决特別攻擊隊的任務，已經完成。接到此大戰果的報告時，司令祗是瞑目說道：</p>
<p>「現在，年輕的隊員們是成爲神了。我一直是如此想的。」</p>
<p>這樣，敵美艦隊是相繼化爲大平洋的藻層了。這就是因爲驕敵美軍將日本海軍的實力估計太低，同時又輕視盡忠報國的至誠如燃的海軍航空部隊的精神的原故。（吉田報道班員）（譯自十月三十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>現代神風</h3>
<p>在菲島東方海面的捷報相繼傳來的二十五日傍晚，最前綫基地司令部接到這樣一個無綫電報：</p>
<p>「敷島隊戰果：空母一艘，一機侖中擊沈；空母一艘，一機侖中起火，航行停止；巡洋艦一艘，一機命中擊沈。」</p>
<p>噫，這個戰果！這正是日本海軍神風特別攻擊隊第一次攻擊隊敷島隊險員以肉體和愛機代替炸彈而獲得的崇高的戰果的第一報！此後，第二次，第三次各神風隊的捷音，將接踵而至。神風特別攻擊隊，多麼崇高的名稱！這是駕駛具有特別爆炸裝置的飛機，抱着必死之心去實行轟炸的。在航空戰史上，可說是空前的創舉。這是祗有日本的航空隊才能做到的空中敢死攻擊。而且，神風特別攻擊隊的壯士，以年輕的海軍航空隊長爲中心，年耙都很輕。至其任務，正如其名所示，在這以國家典亡打賭的菲島洋面海戰中，用敢死肉搏的制先攻擊，捲起了勝利的神風（譯者按：一二八〇年五月元軍大舉攻日，閏七月海上突起颶風，元軍兵船幾乎完全覆沒，故日本史上有神風之說。）所以神風特攻隊的各攻擊隊，作爲各艦載轟炸隊的先鋒，相繼一去不歸地從基地出發。以下便是記者在司令部所在的基地上目覩的神風特別攻擊隊自誕生直到出擊的情形。</p>
<p>敢死精神</p>
<p>敵軍開始在菲律賓羣島中部雷伊泰島登陸的二十日，基地上自拂曉起，便充滿了殺氣。「來了嗎一，驕敵！」一死滅敵的時機已經到來，每一個「海鷲」的眼，都射出殲敵的光芒，露出一死報國的決心。他們是爲了這樣的一天而編成的，他們一直猛烈調練，現在，發揮他們威力的日子，終於來啦！基地上不期面然地湧起了萬歲萬歲的歡呼。精選出來的攻擊隊勇士，都是十九歲到二十四歲的有經騐的靑年戰士。這排空中敢死隊，分爲第一次攻擊隊，第二次攻擊隊及第三次攻擊隊等數班，整列終了。上午十時，來自某基地的司令長官〇〇中將，在本部前面召集全體特別攻擊隊隊員，對他們的出陣作激勵和感謝的訓話。</p>
<p>「國家的興亡，繫於此時此戰，並在各位肩上！這次太平洋大決戰的勝利的神風，將由各位的肉彈捲起來。爲了大元帥陛下，爲了國家，本司令長官希望各位默身盡忠！」</p>
<p>靑年飛行員的眼　，澄如秋水，凝視着〇〇中將。旁邊，是　着拳的Y司令和K副長。中將的聲關和身體，微微抖動，他繼續說道：</p>
<p>「各位唯一的造憾，想必是肉搏攻擊敵艦隊以後，不能知道百己所建的戰勳吧。但是，各位的戰鬥，直接掩護你們的友機必定看淸了報告長官。長官必定將戰果報告各位之前，並奏上大元帥陛下。所以不必引以爲憾。」</p>
<p>激勵終了，長官和特別攻擊隊的靑年壯士熱烈地握手。</p>
<p>之後，「海上行」和「預科練之歌」的齊唱聲，便轟天震地價響了起來。在殺氣和撼奮之中，神風特別攻擊隊遂以身經百戰的海軍航空隊長關大尉爲隊長而誕生了。</p>
<p>風蕭蕭兮</p>
<p>獻身的時機來了。第一次攻擊隊「數島隊」終於出動攻擊。二十五日黎明，濡染朝露的靜寂基地上，整備員漏夜整備起來的神風攻擊機，發出隆隆的轟音。指揮所內，攤着地圖，副長仔細告訴攻擊隊的勇士說：</p>
<p>「攻擊目標是敵方航空母艦，拚掩時須對準航空母艦的弱點。</p>
<p>以後，第一次攻擊隊敷島隊長關大尉大聲對部下道：</p>
<p>「咱們不是轟炸隊，是炸彈。隨咱來吧！」</p>
<p>關隊長雙目烱烱，射出決死的光芒。各個敢死飛行員的瞳孔，也透出無畏的神光。已是出擊的時候了。頭上包着純折布帛的敢死隊靑年隊員，十足表現出他們的決心，連降落傘也不帶，相繼　登有特別爆炸裝置的飛機。機聲隆然，隊長機首先起飛，接着二號機三號機也相爾而起，基地上面湧起一陣廖烟。機上人揮着手，作最後的告別。壯士一去不復返，神風數島隊浩浩蕩蕩飛離基地；從今以後，他們不再歸來了。</p>
<p>右肘負傷的Y司令，扶着松葉杖，倚在從兵身上，親臨歡送部下靑年勇士出發，副長也仰首注視敷島隊，不住揮動着防署帽，直到敷島隊的機影，深深沒入南方的天際。（藤野報道班員）（譯自十月三十日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>雷伊泰島形勢圖</h3>
<p>敵美在雷伊泰島登陸已一月，環繞該島之陸海空戰鬥，日益熾烈。陸地方面日軍與敵兵在密林中展開白刃戰。日空軍猛炸巴魯方面敵機塲。薩馬島東方海面，敵船團受重損，奧莫克方面敵軍亦受重創。</p>

<h3>別離前夕</h3>
<p>— 明烟</p>
<p>爲了生活，我得携了行囊投奔他鄉。</p>
<p>車票買在决最，照理，當晚該是向親友們辭行的一個機會，要他們知道，我已經開始自立，用自己的力量去謀獨立生存，誰說一個女孩子除了嫁人就沒路可走！可是沒有，一個親戚一個朋友也沒去說一聲，即使說了又怎樣？大不了面子上做出些別離的惆悵，招呼聲：「去了來信呀！」「什麼時候再回來呢？」虛僞而淡漠的口頭關心，在他們算人情做到，反過來，自己倒悽楚地悲哀起來，顯然的，這地方沒有一個眞眞關懷或牽掛我的人！</p>
<p>這一晚，我顯得多麼孤冷，多麼冷落！沒有一個人影來探望我一下。不怪，　知道你不聲不響就要走呢，也沒有一個人替我餞行。早上餘下的冷飯我還得動手熱了才能吃，然而睬着牆角冰凉的炭爐，我祗發怔：那口小鍋早就還了底下的房東太太。常言道：「冷茶冷飯好吃，冷言熱語難受。」管他的！吃，揣起來，爬進這麽一口，沒有菜？案上有本食譜，裏面有鮮蝦燒豆腐，栗子紅燜肉，炸麵巾…就着旁邊一碟醃蘿蔔絲，嚥了一口，又一口。</p>
<p>穿過咽喉，溜下去像一塊冰團，伴和的蘿蔔絲，反噎出一股酸味，酸中夾點兒凉，還不算苦！心中的感覺也是冷冷的，不過冷得很平靜，這平靜直到外面響起一陣叩門聲，這才捲起了漩渦，然而僅管叩門聲騷動了寂靜的空氣，我還沒忘記藏起了碗碟，抹抹嘴唇，裝出沒吃過冷飯的樣子。</p>
<p>進來的人使我驚異，她拎着一個提盒，一面似責備而又慈祥的說：</p>
<p>「明兒要走了，別人不打招呼，怎麼連外婆也不理會一聲！唉！年靑人做事莽撞，要不是早上我來了，你不在屋裏，看你收拾好的箱囊，我還不知道眞的明天就動身啦……</p>
<p>我接過了她手中的提盒，微笑而無言，心下也譴責着自己做事糊塗。</p>
<p>盒蓋掀去，噴出一股杳甜的熱氣，我喜的跳起來拉着外婆的手，她悽楚地笑着望我：</p>
<p>「吃罷！熱着呢，就這麼一去，又不知那天回來了……」是的，「就這麼一去，又不知那天回來了……」這是外祖母的話，這句話很熟習，我不止聽見這一次，她的女兒和她的兒子，她好像都對他們這樣說過，她送走了她的女兒到另一個世界，又放走了兩個兒子遠去塞邊，她常對我說：王三姐守丈夫（薛平貴）一十八年，她守兒子究竟要等到那天？想到了兒子，她就老淚縱橫呌我替她寫信，信上的話像很多，但是歸根結底無非是呌他們快回來，她想他們，她想，他們也應該想着她。封好了信口，她押了我走向郵局，親眼看着它投進信箱，其實這封信根本就沒去處，它就不知落在那個陌生人手裏撕掉算數，這是我心裏的話，但又從來沒有吐露的膽量。</p>
<p>如今又將送走她惟一的孫女，沒有多大的悲哀；僅是無聲的嘆息……。</p>
<p>她望着那見了空氣，凍結得起了皺紋的　餅呌我多吃些，恨不得全塞進了我的肚子。</p>
<p>幽黯的燈光下，對面對坐着這兩個孤獨的人，一老一小，天地似乎造下道兩個人像是有意搬弄使我們巧合在一起，你憐憫着我，我關心着你。</p>
<p>在濛濛的曉蓩中，我們開始要分手了，臨上車她還緊緊地叮囑：「來信啊」！我際然地點點頭，望着她顫動的嘴唇却沒有聽見半句成語……</p>
<p>街燈在光明的朝晨由黯淡漸次熄滅，掉過頭來，前面已是蔚藍的長空和廣漠的原野，不知何時，軍已行將百里之外了。</p>
<h3>晚</h3>
<p>— 君羊</p>
<p>看天板給炊烟薰暗，</p>
<p>街的顏色是寂冷深濃，</p>
<p>有一串口哨響過，</p>
<p>是倦游歸去的烏鴉，</p>
<p>誰家的窗隙流出了光，</p>
<p>你也該回去了</p>
<p>然而，何處是我的家？</p>
<h3>秋</h3>
<p>— 君羊</p>
<p>屋簷流淚，</p>
<p>窗橋太息，</p>
<p>梧桐亦爲你憔悴了，</p>
<p>究懷着幾許哀怨，</p>
<p>感人如斯心傷？</p>
<h3>腳踏車的故事</h3>
<p>— 嵐影</p>
<p>爲「交通安全運動」作</p>
<p>濤聲的父親買了一輛新的脚踏車，然而用了不到一個星期，又把牠拿去賣了，換了一輛七成新半舊的車來。</p>
<p>原來他父親在私自盤算之下，覺得在此時此地，乘脚踏車無諭如何要比乘電車方便得多，且就經濟原理與精神方面來講，零碎支付車錢與時時在車中受人擁擠或受人么喝，都是比較合算的，有心想給早出晚歸的長女濤聲，也買一輛脚踏車，一時又凑不出許多錢來，於是轉念間，便把自已的一輛全新的脚踏車賣了，改買了一輛半新的。把那多餘的錢便交給濤聲，儘這一筆錢的量，囑她自己去物色和購置。父親的寵愛是偉大的。</p>
<p>懷着感激和崇敬的心，加以莫可言宣的快樂，濤聲開始四處向朋友們訊託，尋求一輛相當的脚踏車。二個星期之後，終於由同事某君的介紹而認識了一位石先生，更由石先生的熱心指導，總算講定了一輛所謂一來路貨」的舊車子。然而舊雖則舊了，卻是很中用的。有一天，九月的野菊花，醉吻着斜陽，是一個明朗的近黃昏。石先生來拜訪濤聲了了</p>
<p>石先生，今朝我出去的時候，闖了禍。車子有點不對了，踏起來老是嘰哩咖啦地響，正預備出去修車呢！」</p>
<p>大凡第一次見面，是因歌唱而相識的，以後見面時，總喜歡談些歌唱的事，同樣濤聲一見石先生時，關於脚踏車的話，便不由思索地脫口而出。</p>
<p>「身子沒有摔痛嗎？是怎麼一回事呢？」石先生問。</p>
<p>「也是我自己騎得太快了，但也不能全怪我。車子經過高山路口的時候，那裏正有一堆等電車的人，人數總在三五十以上，我這樣一路撳着鈴踏過去，驀地橫刺裏擠出一個男人來，麻木不仁地站在路中，還作着「電車來了沒有？」的姿勢。我車輸一時收煞不住，又怕撞傷了那人，就這樣我把自己摔在電車軌道上了。」濤聲是位天眞淘氣的姑娘，邊說邊做着動作。旣已約略地說過了，眉宇間還留着懊惱的嘆息。</p>
<p>「讓我把車子帶回去替您修理一下吧。——您不相信我能修得好嗎？」石先生說，說時並做了一個禮貌上應有的微笑。濤聲心裏很不願讓他拿去修，因如修好了豈不欠下人家一份人情，修不好時，可不能怨怪人家，反而徒然躭擱了時間。然而話讓他說在頭裏了，不給他修時，顯得不相信他能修得好，反而使人立刻下不了台。只好仍把車子交了給他。</p>
<p>業餘的練習員，究竟不是專門的技術工作者。因爲車身機件配置的一脫節，濤聲又一次摔了一交，險些沒讓過往的大卡過往的大卡</p>
<p>濤聲在懊喪之餘，免不得要怨到石先生身上</p>
<p>而在石先生呢，內心的歡仄，喚起了十倍的殷勤，愈加巴結起來。</p>
<p>一日，濤聲推車從辦事處出來，在門口碰見石先生，右先生也是騎車的，一路伴送她回家，途中再三邀她喝茶休息，經不得濤聲再四推辭。便又東拉西扯地想出些話來說。說話好比寫文章，說得好，頭頭是道，簡潔中肯；說得不好，亂七八糟，尤其不能吸引人的注意，說到後來，索性連自己也說糊塗啦，於是紅燈綠燈也不看了，前面旁邊有沒有車子也不管了……</p>
<p>「喀嚓……」——一輛脚踏車撞在巡警的站石上了，車身終於馬臥在柏油路上，車主蛙撲在地。一輛三輸車由身邊疾馳而過，帶去了他手臂上的一片皮。身後的一輛黃包車不可責備地從脚踏車上拉了過去。</p>
<p>俗語說：「有一，有二，必有三！」濤聲連摔過二交，這一次連她自己也以爲必是可要輸着她來闖禍了。</p>
<p>然而，事實上，受到損傷的卻是石先生，不是她。這次，石先生的足踝骨是折斷了！</p>
<p>濤聲回到家裏，半天不言語，後來，才愼重其事地向他的父親說道：「父親，我們以後騎車的時候，千萬不要騎得太快，尤其不要在車子上和人談天，並且時時應該檢查自己的車子有沒有任何毛病，否則太危險了。馬路　的似虎口。」</p>
<p>父親點着頭。</p>
<p>從此，濤聲是謹愼而又小心了。然而，誰敢說馬路上已沒有粗心大意的騎車人！</p>

<h3>申報杯籃球聯賽　甲乙兩組最近形勢</h3>
<p>申報盃籃球聯賽，甲乙兩組，均已有眉目。停賽一週後，自今日起照常舉行。茲將甲組及乙組各部，各作一最近形勢觀，隊員及球迷可按圖索驥。</p>
<p>甲組　華聯藥廠領　羣雄</p>
<p>華聯藥廠已六戰六勝，保持不敗紀錄者，碩果僅存，對於錦標自屬呼聲最高。其次常以中北汕隊僅敗一次，追隨於後。大華華南雖各敗二次，尚可力爭上游。明星仁餘同仁華影將在名次上爭先後。V除已屢戰屢北，殿單一席，恐亦非該隊莫屬。附形勢表：</p>
<p>乙一部　仁餘驚聲　半斤八兩</p>
<p>乙一部仁餘鷺聲實力相埒，目下均連戰皆捷。在晨友盃中兩隊亦曾相逢，鷺聲獲勝甚多。此賽中仁餘更加强實力，誓必報此一箭之仇，而奪得部冠軍也。誠孚極爲振作，中行梵江，力有不逮耳。</p>
<p>乙二部　大華中儲　胖隊並峙</p>
<p>此部之胖隊與中儲，均三戰三勝。與大華乙之二戰二勝，並峙進行。究實力似以大華較勝，但胖隊諸將，經騐豐富，屆時或能有妙策破敵，故二部必爲上列二隊所必爭，中儲亦爲銀錢業中所負盛名者。故此部最爲精彩，競爭最烈。</p>
<p>乙三部　飛隊燦爛靑協有爲</p>
<p>三部飛隊已四戰四勝，如此自屬前途燦爛，唯靑協以出塲次數較少，亦保持不敗紀錄。而靑協最近之成績，極見進境，曾獲其他乙組聯賽錦標，日後戴能脫穎而上，壓倒飛隊。飛鴻尚未有勝績，暫居未座。</p>
<p>乙四部　慕爾全勝汕隊緊隨</p>
<p>汕隊遞承甲組之作風，故演出殊稱佳妙。在乙組隊中，確爲難得之隊伍。目下尙出戰二次，故應列在慕爾四戰四勝之後。唯來日汕隊與慕爾相遇，後者恐難挫其鋒。論之，常以汕隊爲最具希望，其次慕爾隊，炸隊庸碌，難期發展，夏風尚有可爲。</p>
<p>乙五部　晨友藍鶴立鷄羣</p>
<p>五部各隊實力最爲平均，如振源雖連負二次，均爲些微相差。鐵夫亦不幸慘敗一次，然前途均仍具希望。晨友藍目下鶴立雞羣，以後暗礁極多，亦不可不謹情從事。該隊有王立鐸王存瑞等老將，自易多發展。玲瓏乃爲實力最弱者。</p>
<p>乙六部　中北伶友完軍必爭</p>
<p>此部中有殿軍希望者，當爲强師與間益。但查强師爲純粹一學校中之教職員所組織，尤爲滬上第一。球藝雖較差，此點亦值得一提也。致本部之領袖，大致爲中北。蓋有甲組隊員所薰陶，况穆時彥等身手不凡，日後壓倒伶友，攫奪首席，有厚望焉。</p>
<p>綜觀乙組，尚未屆緊張關頭，今日起又將展開戰事，嗣後均爲日趨外化之鏡頭。預測各路小英雄，必枕戈待旦，以期奪得分部冠軍。而產生分部冠軍以後，尚須決奪總冠軍，則以六組中之精銳對壘，未必較甲組賽爲遜色。且可由此中獲得不少後起之秀。</p>
<p>停賽一週今日續賽</p>
<p>今日起申報盃，照例繼續舉行，秩序照舊，唯下週一三五之比賽，即爲本週停賽之三天補上，以後秩序，除星期日外，依此類推。致下週甲組賽極多精彩節目，週一大華明星亦屬一塲好戲。蓋後者匠勤於練習，球藝日見進境，大華必受一番威脅。</p>
<p>華聯汕隊週三決鬥</p>
<p>週三十二日）華聯汕隊之戰，已爲球球迷所集中談話資料，有謂華聯穏勝，亦有謂汕隊自慘敗於華南後，臥薪嘗膽，此番必誓師應廠。且聞汕隊近日來積極約各隊作友誼資，並在俱樂部討論戰策，可見雄心不小也。華聯自始至終，一貫精神，規定練習，屈時如有其神機妙算。球迷是日應早去，以免向隅，蓋塲地狹小，限制所致，不得不爾。</p>
<p>週五甲組兩幕好戲</p>
<p>週五甲組一塲爲華影與明星，前者係電影明星，後者之明星，乃明星香水廠仝人所組織，故以此名。兩明星皆有卯上之成績，唯兩隊最近之缺點，亦同爲人馬難齊。但此戰有關名次甚大，必各盡心鬥法。另幕爲中北對大華，又可轟動一時。蓋中北之演出，有大量觀衆所信仰，而大華究不失爲上乘之流，且兩隊特多籃球壇止久負盛名之士，各有經騐，各有絕技，表演之精彩，可以預下也。</p>
<h3>今晨足球聯賽　東葡大戰前言</h3>
<p>今日上午十時，在逸園東華葡商一役，允稱本季開賽以來最精彩之一幕，兩雄相逢，惡戰自在意中，且本屆係採單循環制，勝負有關錦標前途，雙方必更謹愼將事，以求一逞。故除鬥力外，允需鬥智，那一隊調度有方，運略得宜，那一隊便獲勝利。</p>
<p>葡商陣容標悍可畏</p>
<p>葡商出塲陣容，已於日前公佈，與在福利賽戰聯誼時略有更調。老英雄考司坦改踢左前衛，而以鮑休脫出主中軍，左翼由後起之秀凱麻波羅充任。經此調整，中衛綫固若金湯，倍見雄厚，前鋒亦極標悍可畏。觀共日來勵兵秣馬，劍及履及，司馬之心，不問可知。東華臨茲大敵，義無反顧。惟能否痛飮黃龍，余實爲危。東華最近幾塲比賽，演出未臻理想。老將中除戴麟經外，其餘均不够氣，李寗孫錦順如不能恢復上季末顚峯姿態，則此一仗委實兇多吉少，更不能不令人憂心！</p>
<p>鉗住福恩制勝關鍵</p>
<p>論前鋒，葡遜中內衛則東不如葡。福恩爲滬上　佳右翼，盤傳切射，迅如鷹隼，係葡隊中般危險人物。比速度，阿梁李寗遠非其敵，此子不可與力拚，應視球勢，站住適常地位，予以先後夾擊，憑梁李二人之經騐，並出全力對付，或可阻其兇燄。鐔福禎除在中塲擱襲外，應常退後助守，以補梁李之不足，福恩如被關煞，葡之右路攻勢必大見削弱，而大局安定矣。考司坦旣任左得球後，切忘多盤，須視機會將球向前挑送，然後機會將球向前挑送，然後與之作三十碼距離之奔跑，逮共力竭，再行進取。考老矣，經騐雖豐，以言長力，究竟敵不過血氣方剛之小伙子也。</p>
<p>張邦綸近况欠佳，此次冀能力圖振作，對於V蘇若之冷箭，允應格外留意。張林根不宜遠出，嚴密監視蘇若，不予絲毫放鬆，蘇如减少活動，則葡之右路攻勢，亦不足畏矣</p>
<p>總之，此役爲一智與力之鬥爭。以東華諸將之精神旺盛，同仇敵風，茍能穩紮穩打，步步爲營，則葡雖頑强，要非不可破也，勉旃望旃！</p>
<h3>百餘健兒參加　運動大會</h3>
<p>上海靑年會體育部主辦全滬秋季運動大會，於今日上午九時起，假泰山路吳興路（近汶林路）俄僑體育會新田徑塲舉行。參加者男女健兒，共計一一百十一人。滬上田徑名將如短跑之朱沙飛，標槍王學武，跳遠劉德寬，跳高李震中，鐵餅郭其昌，鉛球關宏達，及長跑王正林樓文敖等無不繼羅儘致，誠戰事以後環滬上田徑運動之空前盛會。幷有靑年中學表演團體操，精武體育會，民生國術研究社，新聞報國術班及靑年會表演各種國術與拌角，靑年會健身團表演舉重及健美體格鍛練法，國術名教師佟忠義于福鴻亦被邀請到塲表演生平絕技。大會得靑年會會友張溎祥熱心贊助，負擔經費，並向各方徵集獎品頗多。（樂）</p>
<h3>什錦</h3>
<p>鐵夫足籃球隊，於本週一出征南通，爲該地冬賑籌款，並有女明星四姊妹偕行，全體即將於今日返滬。</p>
<p>晨友盃後，據說將有銀行盃舉行，自限於銀行從業員，鹽業謝益欽極爲起勁。蓋謝君乃前辦銀錢聯誼會籃球聯賽之主幹，此次死灰復燃，要亦鑒於銀行員之生活過於苦悶</p>
<p>正行女子中學發起主辦正行盃全滬女子個人乒乓錦標賽，章程等由委員陳霖笙草擬，於今日下午三時，在該校開委員會義，並歡迎顧問（球大王）</p>

<p>Weekly Review</p>
<h3>Written After the Naval Battle of Taiwan and the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Question: It is a well-known fact that the enemy Americans suffered unprecedented damage in the two naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines. However, recently, the number of American troops landing on Leyte Island has gradually increased; at the same time, in terms of the navy, there are also mobile units cruising the sea, showing a tendency to move restlessly. May I ask what impact this action will have on the future of the war?</p>
<p>Answer: In the naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the enemy Americans' main mobile forces suffered fatal blows, and more than half of the Nimitz fleet was annihilated, which can be said to be the biggest loss since the start of the war. However, before the naval battle, the United States had already made a determination to sacrifice, so it did not hesitate to mobilize its powerful naval forces to challenge Japan. The strategic objective of the enemy Americans' navy is, on the one hand, to prepare to lure the main Allied fleet to fight a decisive battle, and on the other hand, to hope to use the landing in the central Philippines as a base in the central Pacific in order to cut off the connection between Japan and the South Pacific. The reason why the US naval mobile force did not hesitate to make such reckless moves at a great sacrifice was precisely for this purpose. However, while the strategy of the United States is like this, Japan's is not. Japan's strategy is to figure out how to consume the US Navy, how to annihilate the US Navy, and thereby seize the best opportunity for a decisive battle. Therefore, Japan can ignore the actions of the US Army, and its main goal is still the Navy. The heroic sacrifices of the past in Omiya, Saipan, and other islands are not because Japan underestimated the gains and losses of these islands, but because the gains and losses of these islands did not affect the overall situation of the war, and the fundamental reason was that the time to annihilate the main force of the US Navy had not yet arrived. Now, the US Army units landing on Leyte Island have increased to as many as seven divisions. The United States believes that this is beneficial to the war and that the future is promising. In fact, the more the US Army is strengthened, the more disadvantageous it is to the US Navy, and the more opportunities it has to be annihilated. After the landing force on Leyte Island is strengthened to seven divisions, a large amount of ammunition, weapons, food, medicine, and other supplies must be continuously replenished. At this time, the number of transport ships required will increase even more. Now, assuming that the ships required to supply one division of troops are 300,000 tons, then the ships required to supply seven divisions of troops will be at least 2 million tons or more. A transport fleet of 2 million tons must have a large number of cruisers and destroyers to protect it, but cruisers and destroyers lack combat power, so main battleships and aircraft carriers must be added to enhance combat power. At this time, the appearance of a large number of naval forces in the vicinity of the Philippines is a great danger to the United States. At the same time, the closer the US Navy is to the Philippine mainland, the more opportunities it has to encounter attacks from the Japanese Navy and Air Force, and the greater the danger. The last disastrous defeat of the US Navy was also due to this reason; future naval battles will continue to occur, and in the near future, we will see the misfortune of the US fleet again.</p>
<p>Question: However, the US military also has strong productivity behind it. Although the US fleet has suffered heavy blows, it can still use its strong production capacity to continue fighting Japan. What do you think?</p>
<p>Answer: The overall productivity of the United States cannot be underestimated. However, today's war is not only a war of materials, nor is it only a war of numbers. There is also the most important and indispensable main driving force, which is the spiritual element. The people of the enemy Americans are nurtured in an environment of freedom and enjoyment, and they pay special attention to their personal interests. Therefore, on the battlefield, they often only consume large amounts of weapons and ammunition, and regard their own lives as heavy as Mount Tai; while the Japanese people have always been known for their hard work and endurance. Only because they can endure hardship can they despise their personal lives, and only because they can endure hardship can they shoulder the important task of the rise and fall of the country. In the naval battles of Taiwan and the Philippines, the Japanese Air Force Special Attack Force was able to use the earth-shattering and soul-stirring heroic "meat bomb" tactics to perish together with the US fleet, and ultimately achieve huge war results and establish an absolutely invincible situation. The reason should be entirely attributed to the Japanese people's spirit of "sacrificing oneself for the country." Therefore, I say: spirit comes first, and matter comes second.</p>
<p>Question: However, the future is long, how will the future of the war develop? Will the trend of the war necessarily be beneficial to Japan?</p>
<p>Answer: Great undertakings cannot be achieved in a single day. Similarly, the final glory must be sought in the midst of all kinds of hardships. Only the spirit of perseverance and indomitable spirit is the only element of success. In the course of a long war, victory is not enough to be proud of, and defeat is not necessarily discouraging. Only in the last decisive battle can victory or defeat be clear. We can predict that the US fleet will come again. In the future, whether in the Philippines, Taiwan, or other seas, there will inevitably be naval battles of a larger scale and more intense than this naval battle. However, the farther the enemy American fleet is from its base, the more unfavorable it is in combat, which is more favorable to Japan. Although future Japanese-US naval battles will not occur in the Tsushima Strait, we can be sure that the enemy American fleet will suffer the same tragic fate as the Baltic Fleet.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Occupies Key Points in Guangxi, Shrinking the Encirclement</h3>
<p>South China Front, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) After losing Guilin and Liuzhou, the Chongqing army has collapsed and is retreating southwest. Part of the Japanese army is still pursuing the Chongqing army, launching encirclement and annihilation battles everywhere. Since the Japanese army advanced into the area between Laibin and Qianjiang, it eliminated the stubborn resistance of the 156th Division of the Chongqing army on the north bank of the Wu River, and braved the air raids of the Chongqing-American air force, and forcibly crossed the Wu River on the 11th, and continued to advance north from near Xun'anwei on the opposite bank. On the morning of the 13th, they occupied the key point of Baijian Village and wiped out the over-military forces nearby. In addition, another part of the Japanese army occupying Qianjiang also continued to advance north, cutting off the retreat of the Chongqing army, and is currently shrinking the encirclement.</p>
<h3>Fierce Land Battles on Leyte, Japanese Army Secures Various Heights, Launching Strong Attacks on Enemy Convoys and Airfields Day After Day</h3>
<p>Manila, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The attacks of the Japanese Army on Leyte Island are becoming more and more fierce. The Japanese army, with Tagami in the central mountain range of Leyte Island as its back, launched a surprise attack on the main force of the enemy's 96th Division, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy and causing them to fall into great chaos. The various heights are still being secured by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The Japanese Air Force is still launching strong attacks on enemy convoys and enemy airfields in Leyte Bay day after day. At dawn on the 15th and 16th, they bombed enemy transport convoys in Leyte Bay and enemy land facilities and airfields on Leyte Island, destroying one enemy medium-sized transport ship and causing explosions and fires in several places in Tacloban Airport and several places in the city.</p>
<h3>Captured Enemy American Air Force Recounts Attack on Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Dispatch) The captured enemy American airmen have now been escorted to Nanjing. The reporter made a special visit to one of them, and the conversation was as follows: (Question) Please briefly describe the situation when you set out on this expedition. (Answer) At noon on November 9, we departed from a base in India and arrived near Chengdu at 7:00 p.m. On the 11th, we departed again at 2:00 a.m. to bomb Japan. After departing for a considerable period of time, due to the bad weather, we changed our original plan and bombed Nanjing. (Question) Did the captain give any instructions when you set out? (Answer) There were no clear instructions, because we are all Catholics, so before departing, we all gathered in one place, prayed, and then received maps and aerial photographs to prepare for departure. (Question) What was the situation when you arrived over Nanjing? (Answer) We were all guided by the instructors and did not know where Nanjing was, but soon the Japanese anti-aircraft guns seemed to have started firing at the front, back, left, and right of the plane, and there were explosions of shells everywhere. (Question) B29. The type of aircraft was previously advertised as absolutely inviolable. What are its advantages? (Answer) I used to trust it quite a bit, but recently many of them have been shot down in northern Kyushu, and we have doubts about its performance. (Question) What was the situation when you were hit? (Answer) Now when I think about it, it's like a dream. After I opened the bomb bay and the bombs had just left the plane, I felt a violent push. At first, I thought it was the sound of the bombs I had dropped exploding, but then I realized that I had made a mistake. It turned out that it was a Japanese anti-aircraft shell that hit the bombs I had dropped, causing them to explode. This was truly a miracle. Not long after, I looked out of the window on the right side and saw that one of the engines on the right wing was on fire. I immediately contacted other planes and told them that my plane was on fire. Not long after, the two engines on the right wing stopped working, and the fuselage tilted to the right, and the fire became more intense. Then the left wing also caught fire and burned, spreading throughout the plane, and the entire plane separated. At this time, the speaking tube may also have been damaged, so I did not hear the order to parachute. The fate of death was approaching us, so we overcame all obstacles and descended with parachutes with the passage of time. From the time the parachute opened until I was captured by the Japanese army, the situation was clear to me. Although I am now a prisoner, it is better than going back. (Question) Your bombing is almost blind bombing, and many innocent Chinese civilians have been innocently sacrificed. You said earlier that you were Catholics, and you prayed before you set out. What do you, as a Catholic, think about the blind bombing and killing of the innocent? (Answer) This is purely a matter of necessity. We were ordered to bomb and did not know the result. We are all forced to do so in the bombing deaths of Chinese civilians, what else can I say.</p>

<h3>Exerting All Strength of Six Armies for a General Offensive on the Siegfried Line, Fierce Battles Underway in Three Key Areas</h3>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Eisenhower deployed the U.S. Ninth Army, the final reserve force, to the front lines on the 16th, contrary to German expectations. A large-scale offensive and defensive battle has begun along the 700-kilometer front stretching from the Dutch coast to the Swiss border. The focal points of the entire front are currently the Metz, Aachen, and Venlo regions. A general overview of the battle situation is as follows: (1) Although the French army has launched attacks from the Swiss border with Saarbrücken as the target, their objective is to reach the Rhine River via Belfort and Mulhouse, between the Jura and Vosges Mountains in Switzerland, to cover the main force of the British army and attack the central German lines. This is very clear. The U.S. Seventh Army and the French army are directly attacking the Vosges Mountains in parallel. (2) The U.S. Third Army, under the command of Patton, is concentrating its attack on Metz, but its aim is to gather super-heavy weaponry to break through the German defense lines and reach the mouth of the Main River via the Saar. The northern flank of this army is also concentrating a large force. (3) The British Second Army and the U.S. Army are closely coordinating their offensives, launching an offensive in the Venlo area, with Canadian troops deployed on the northernmost flank. From the above situation, it is clear that Eisenhower has committed all the strength of his six armies to the attack on the Siegfried Line. However, the anti-Axis forces will find it extremely difficult to achieve their goals, as time, the greatest factor in determining the outcome of the battle, is running late.</p>
<p>The Northern Front Approaches Cologne</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency) – The anti-Axis forces are currently fiercely attacking Cologne, the heart of German heavy industry, and reports indicate that they have broken into the Strasbourg and Karlsruhe regions. According to London reports, the U.S. First and Ninth Armies are engaged in fierce fighting 30 kilometers south of Cologne, and are said to have advanced to a point 7 kilometers from the crucial transportation hub of Jülich and the Cologne Plain.</p>
<p>Fierce Bombardment by Thousands of Aircraft</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: The new offensive by the U.S. Ninth Army in the Aachen area was launched thanks to improved flying weather. The offensive was preceded by over a thousand bombers, followed by infantry and tanks. Autumn weather is often favorable to the anti-Axis forces and unfavorable to the German defenders. Furthermore, the continent has been plagued by clouds and fog this year, making it difficult for German aircraft to take off and land, while the British Isles have clear weather, allowing British aircraft to frequently fly to the continent.</p>

<h3>Two Police Officers Abuse Authority, Fisherman Beaten to Death: Court Concludes Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Zhu Daoyuan, a police officer from the Yanjing Branch of the Municipal Police Bureau's Yanjiaqiao Police Station, was ordered to be on duty at the Yanjiaqiao embankment at 5:00 p.m. on August 22nd of this year. A fishing boat happened to pass through Yanjiaqiao, and Zhu ordered it to stop for inspection. It turned out that Zhu's attempt to extort money from the boat owner failed, leading to a conflict with Chu Xingeng, a member of the boat crew. Zhu, feeling insulted and losing face as a police officer, returned to the station and, together with another police officer, Wang Guangjiang (28 years old, from Nanjing), returned to the boat, holding a rope. Chu Xingeng, seeing this, was frightened and went ashore to escape, but the two police officers chased after him to the bank of the Huangpu River. Chu Xingeng, in a moment of desperation, jumped into the river and drowned. After the incident, the local Procuratorate investigated and found the facts to be true, and prosecuted the two police officers for abusing their authority, causing death. Yesterday, the case was formally tried in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. The two defendants completely denied the matter in court, but as the facts of the case were clear, the court announced the end of the debate and scheduled a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Economic Relations between Central China and Manchuria</h3>
<p>Mr. Furuhai, Director-General of General Affairs of Manchukuo, who came to Shanghai to attend the Sino-Manchurian Economic Adjustment Conference, met with a group of reporters on the 15th and delivered a speech on Manchukuo's mission of wartime economy and the adjustment of Sino-Manchurian economic relations, as follows: The economic relationship between Central China and Manchuria in the past cannot be called smooth. Now that the situation has entered a decisive stage, it is naturally necessary to overcome all difficulties in order to achieve a satisfactory adjustment. The problem of prices will be easily solved after the establishment of credit lending. In short, the primary task is to enable the important products of the two regions to be exchanged with each other. As for the handling of credit lending, based on this, we must make every effort to eliminate petty bureaucratic concepts. Fortunately, a certain amount of credit lending worth hundreds of millions has been established between Manchuria and Central China, and the economic adjustment between the two regions based on mutual understanding has been largely settled. Now, we must continue to work hard based on this principle to promote the exchange of materials between the two regions.</p>
<h3>Police Bureau Actively Promotes Crime Prevention Work</h3>
<p>The Crime Prevention Section of the Judicial Department of the Municipal Police Bureau can be said to be sparing no effort in planning and managing crime prevention work. In terms of propaganda, in addition to publishing regular publications, it will also stage the crime prevention drama "Turning Back Is the Shore" at the Lyceum Theatre for four days starting today (the 19th), and will also publish "The Meaning of Crime Prevention," on the one hand, to show that the police authorities attach importance to crime prevention, and on the other hand, to call for popularizing general legal knowledge among the people and the cooperation of all levels of society. However, on the part of the people, it goes without saying that we deeply hope that the police bureau will maintain law and order, but we even more sincerely hope that the police and judicial authorities themselves will earnestly rectify themselves to achieve a state of integrity and public service, so that the "all-knowing" policing of the past can be eliminated at once, and the spirit of true rule of law can be brought into full play. Rectifying oneself and rectifying others, with a two-pronged approach, can the ultimate goal of crime prevention be achieved.</p>
<h3>Director Ye Speaks on the Aftermath of the Nantong Steamer Disaster</h3>
<p>The Nantong steamer of the China Shipping Company sank in Hupu on October 23rd, resulting in the drowning of over a thousand passengers. Yesterday, Director Ye Xuesong of the Public Utilities Bureau made the following statement on the aftermath of the case: The bureau attaches great importance to this case. The company's Huatai steamer had an accident last winter, and a satisfactory solution has not yet been reached. It is a great regret that this has happened again. We have sent personnel to the company to inquire about the follow-up issues. We have learned that the company has now formed a Nantong Steamer Disaster Aftermath Committee, which may soon decide how to compensate the families of the deceased. As for the cause of the accident, the Japanese naval attaché is assisting in a thorough investigation, and salvage work is also being actively carried out. The bureau has urged the company to quickly handle everything in order to comfort the families of the deceased.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Art Gallery Opens Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chinese art and culture originated the earliest. For thousands of years, the cultural relics have been splendid, and the national spirit is treasured here. However, because there has been little organized research work in the country, the precious cultural relics left over from the past dynasties have either flowed into foreign lands or been locked in the hands of private individuals, and the public cannot easily see them, which has greatly affected the progress of art and culture. Famous people in Shanghai, such as Tang Wenzhi, Zhao Shuru, Hu Puan, Ding Fubao, Xu Langxi, Wu Zhenxiu, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Yuqian, and Chen Binhe, have seen this and have specially established the Chinese Art Gallery to preserve antiquities, conduct open research, promote art, and improve culture. It is scheduled to open at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow. The famous porcelain of past dynasties collected by the gallery from major collectors in Shanghai is the most artistically valuable antique in our country and will also be systematically displayed during the opening period. This is truly an unprecedented event. Admission tickets are not charged, but in order to limit the number of people, each person is requested to donate 50 yuan each to the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund and the China Health Association to benefit poor students and promote public health. Observing the legacy of our ancestors and promoting our national spirit is truly spiritual food for the public and a good opportunity to appreciate ancient art. We also hope that schools and institutions will visit in groups. (The address of the gallery is Majestic Building, 996 Jing'an Temple Road).</p>

<h3>Divine Wind Special Attack Force: Remarkable Achievements Established in the Seas off the Philippines, Enemy American Pacific Fleet Turned into Seaweed</h3>
<p>The day when the arrogant enemy American fleet would be turned into the Pacific seabed has finally arrived. On October 25th, the Japanese Navy suddenly launched a fierce sea and air combined attack on the remaining main force of the enemy American fleet in the eastern sea area of the Philippines. We had been eagerly anticipating such a day in our hearts, praying to the gods and Buddha, hoping it would come soon, and now it has indeed come. Who can forget the emotions and excitement of this day? Just a few days ago, naval aviators, who had been gazing at the vast sky and lamenting the absence of enemy planes, are now piloting elite aircraft, as numerous as clouds and mist, and bravely going to annihilate the enemy.</p>
<p>On this day, the weather in the Philippines was clear after a long period of rain. Today is suitable for launching an attack. The Allied aircraft, which had been gathering day and night, had all preparations completed through the tireless efforts of the maintenance personnel before the general attack was about to begin. The first strike to destroy the enemy was launched by the naval air force's preemptive attack. The target was the enemy's aircraft carrier group. The enemy, who had invaded Leyte Gulf and forcibly landed near Tacloban, was mobilizing the full strength of their remaining fleet to cover this landing force and establish a strong bridgehead in the Philippines. Only after resolving the enemy's air force in this area can our fleet fully exert its power under our air supremacy. Therefore, the task undertaken by the naval air force based in the Philippines is truly significant. As soon as the order for a general attack came down, aircraft after aircraft thundered off the base in succession.</p>
<p>All naval aviators are determined to die. Among them, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force is the essence of the Japanese Navy. The name of these guardian eagles of the nation should be forever remembered. They attacked with human bombs, crashing into enemy aircraft carriers with both men and machines. Once they flew out of the base and discovered the enemy American mobile unit, they would never return. This kind of suicide special attack force is the main axis of the front-line air force, organized to shoulder the important task of the nation's survival, and they are a long-trained air suicide squad.</p>
<p>"We are standing at the forefront of the entire nation's expedition, permanently protecting the glorious history of the motherland. The tradition of the Imperial Navy must be brought into play today." Naval youth pilots, holding such beliefs, had blood boiling throughout their bodies. The commander, who personally visited the base of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, was deeply moved by the tragic feelings of the young pilots. When he delivered a training speech with tears in his eyes, the young warriors did not even twitch their eyebrows.</p>
<p>Calm and Composed</p>
<p>On the 25th, the time for a general attack had arrived. The young warriors of the special attack force looked up at the clear sky and said lightly:</p>
<p>"We'll definitely do it today!"</p>
<p>"Please take care of everything!" While saying this, they warmly shook the hands of the maintenance personnel. There were cheers everywhere. Afterward, everyone silently raised their hands to salute each other.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, everyone had this kind of silent attitude at the moment of departing for a suicide attack, because in the distant homeland, there were elderly parents, and also a beloved wife who had just married this spring. So, what are these young pilots thinking in their hearts now? In the rumbling sound of the engines, the reporter stared at the young warriors climbing into their beloved planes. Their mouths were tightly closed, and one could see their firm determination. And a serene smile floated on their faces. They moved calmly and as usual. Once they became airborne, there was nothing in the minds of the naval aviators except the thought of sinking enemy aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Anxiously Awaiting Victory</p>
<p>The sound of the aircraft engines thundered crisply. The planes took off smoothly along the runway, one after another. Some warriors waved goodbye to the personnel on the ground, while others were wholeheartedly maneuvering their aircraft. They all formed up into squadrons in the sky above the base. This first attack squadron of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force then disappeared into the blue sky. Afterward, several hours had passed. If they had not found the enemy, then they should have returned to the enemy aircraft carrier. The base suddenly became noisy.</p>
<p>After they found them, what would happen? It would be best if they succeeded happily, but if they were blocked by the enemy's defensive fire and could not hit the aircraft carrier, wouldn't the deaths of the young warriors be too regrettable? At this time, everyone couldn't help but become worried.</p>
<p>Mission Accomplished</p>
<p>However, that afternoon, a report witnessed by Allied aircraft was transmitted from another base. The situation was like this:</p>
<p>"The first special attack squadron discovered the enemy American mobile unit in the sea area from Suluan to 〇〇 degrees 〇〇. Two planes rammed into aircraft carriers, sinking them; one plane rammed into an aircraft carrier, setting it on fire (the enemy aircraft carrier was unable to navigate); one plane hit a cruiser, sinking it."</p>
<p>Ah, how tragic! This was not a bomb hitting the enemy ship, but men and machines hitting the enemy ship together. The mission of the first special attack squadron has been completed. When the report of this great achievement was received, the commander simply closed his eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Now, the young team members have become gods. I have always thought so."</p>
<p>In this way, the enemy American fleet is successively turning into the seaweed of the Pacific Ocean. This is because the arrogant enemy American forces underestimated the strength of the Japanese Navy, and at the same time despised the spirit of the naval air force, which is as sincere as burning for loyalty and service to the country. (Report by Yoshida News Team) (Translated from the October 30th Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Modern Divine Wind</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 25th, when the good news from the eastern sea area of the Philippines was successively transmitted, the headquarters of the front-line base received such a wireless telegram:</p>
<p>"The Shikishima squadron's battle results: one aircraft carrier, sunk by one plane ramming; one aircraft carrier, set on fire by one plane ramming, navigation stopped; one cruiser, sunk by one plane hitting."</p>
<p>Alas, this battle result! This is precisely the first report of the lofty battle results obtained by the Shikishima squadron members of the Japanese Navy Divine Wind Special Attack Force, who replaced bombs with their bodies and beloved aircraft! After this, the good news from the second and third Divine Wind squadrons will follow one after another. Divine Wind Special Attack Force, what a noble name! This is to pilot an aircraft with special explosive devices, with the determination to die, to carry out bombing. In the history of air warfare, it can be said to be an unprecedented initiative. This is an air suicide attack that only the Japanese air force can do. Moreover, the warriors of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, centered on the young naval air squadron leader, are all very young. As for its mission, as its name suggests, in this sea battle in the Philippines, which is betting on the nation's survival, it uses a daring hand-to-hand combat to take the lead in the attack, stirring up the Divine Wind of victory (Translator's note: In May 1280, the Yuan army launched a large-scale attack on Japan. In the intercalary July, a hurricane suddenly rose at sea, and almost all of the Yuan army's ships were overturned. Therefore, there is a saying of Divine Wind in Japanese history.) Therefore, each attack squadron of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force, as the vanguard of each carrier-based bombing squadron, successively departs from the base and never returns. The following is what the reporter witnessed at the base where the headquarters is located, the situation from the birth of the Divine Wind Special Attack Force to its departure.</p>
<p>Dare-to-Die Spirit</p>
<p>On the 20th, when the enemy began to land on Leyte Island in the central Philippines, the base was filled with murderous intent from dawn. "Have they come, those arrogant enemies!" The time to annihilate the enemy by death has arrived, and the eyes of every "sea eagle" are shooting out the light of destroying the enemy, revealing the determination to repay the country with death. They were formed for such a day, they have been training fiercely, and now, the day to exert their power has finally come! A cheer of Banzai Banzai spontaneously surged on the base. The carefully selected warriors of the attack squadron are all experienced young soldiers aged nineteen to twenty-four. This air suicide squad is divided into the first attack squadron, the second attack squadron, and the third attack squadron, etc., and the formation is completed. At 10:00 a.m., Commander 〇〇 Lieutenant General from a certain base gathered all the members of the special attack squadron in front of the headquarters and gave them encouraging and grateful remarks for their departure.</p>
<p>"The rise and fall of the country depends on this battle at this time, and it is on your shoulders! The Divine Wind of victory in this great Pacific decisive battle will be stirred up by your human bombs. For His Majesty the Emperor, for the country, this commander hopes that you will devote yourself silently!"</p>
<p>The eyes of the young pilots are as clear as autumn water, staring at 〇〇 Lieutenant General. Next to them are Commander Y and Deputy Commander K with clenched fists. The lieutenant general's voice and body trembled slightly, and he continued:</p>
<p>"The only regret for you must be that after attacking the enemy fleet with hand-to-hand combat, you will not be able to know the achievements you have made. However, your battle will surely be seen clearly by your allied aircraft that directly cover you and reported to the commander. The commander will surely report the battle results to you before reporting them to His Majesty the Emperor. So there is no need to feel regret."</p>
<p>After the encouragement was over, the commander and the young warriors of the special attack squadron shook hands warmly.</p>
<p>After that, the sound of the joint singing of "Sea Journey" and "Preparatory Training Song" resounded through the sky. Amid the murderous intent and excitement, the Divine Wind Special Attack Force was born with Navy Air Corps Captain Seki, a veteran of many battles, as the leader.</p>
<p>The Wind Howls</p>
<p>The time for sacrifice has come. The first attack squadron, the "Kushima Squadron," finally set out to attack. At dawn on the 25th, on the silent base, which was wet with morning dew, the Divine Wind attack aircraft, which the maintenance personnel had been preparing all night, emitted a rumbling roar. Inside the command post, spreading out a map, the deputy commander carefully told the warriors of the attack squadron:</p>
<p>"The target of the attack is the enemy aircraft carrier. When ramming, you must aim at the weak points of the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>After that, Captain Seki, the squadron leader of the first attack squadron Shikishima squadron, said loudly to his subordinates:</p>
<p>"We are not bombing squadrons, we are bombs. Follow me!"</p>
<p>Captain Seki's eyes were bright, shooting out the light of determination to die. The pupils of each suicide pilot also revealed a fearless divine light. It was time to attack. The young members of the suicide squad, with pure folded cloth wrapped around their heads, fully expressed their determination. Without even taking parachutes, they successively climbed into the aircraft with special explosive devices. The sound of the engines roared, and the squadron leader's plane took off first, followed by the second and third planes, and a burst of smoke surged over the base. The people on the plane waved their hands, making their final farewell. The warriors never return, and the Divine Wind Kushima squadron flew away from the base with great momentum; from now on, they will never return.</p>
<p>Commander Y, who had injured his right elbow, leaned on a crutch and leaned on his soldiers, personally came to see off his young warriors departing. The deputy commander also looked up at the Shikishima squadron and kept waving his cap until the silhouette of the Shikishima squadron was deeply submerged in the southern sky.

<h3>Leyte Island Situation Map</h3>
<p>It has been a month since the enemy Americans landed on Leyte Island, and the land, sea, and air battles surrounding the island are becoming increasingly fierce. On land, Japanese troops and enemy soldiers are engaged in close combat in the dense forests. The Japanese air force is fiercely bombing the enemy airfield in the Barue area. In the sea east of Samar Island, the enemy fleet suffered heavy damage, and the enemy forces in the Ormoc area also suffered heavy damage.</p>

<h3>Eve of Farewell</h3>
<p>— Meien</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I have to carry my luggage and go to another country.</p>
<p>The train ticket was bought decisively. Logically, that night should have been an opportunity to say goodbye to relatives and friends, to let them know that I have begun to be independent and use my own strength to seek independent survival. Who says that a girl has no way to go except to marry! But no, I didn't say a word to a relative or a friend. Even if I did, what would happen? At best, they would put on a show of sadness at parting, and greet me with words like, "Write to us when you get there!" "When will you be back?" False and indifferent verbal concern, they think they have done their duty, and on the contrary, I would feel sadly depressed. Obviously, there is no one in this place who truly cares about or misses me!</p>
<p>This night, I seem so lonely, so deserted! Not a single person came to visit me. No wonder, who knows that you are going to leave without saying a word? And no one came to see me off. I still have to heat up the leftover cold rice from the morning to eat it, but stepping on the cold charcoal stove in the corner of the wall, I just stared blankly: that small pot had already been returned to the landlady downstairs. As the saying goes: "Cold tea and cold rice are delicious, but cold words and hot words are hard to bear." Who cares! Eat, pocket it, and climb into this mouth. No vegetables? There is a cookbook on the table, with recipes for fresh shrimp with tofu, braised chestnut pork, fried noodles... Swallowing a bite, then another, with a plate of pickled radish shreds next to it.</p>
<p>Passing through the throat, it slipped down like a block of ice, and the accompanying radish shreds regurgitated a sour taste, with a hint of coolness in the sourness, but not bitter! The feeling in my heart is also cold, but cold and calm. This calmness was stirred up by a knock on the door outside, but even though the knock disturbed the quiet air, I didn't forget to hide the bowls and plates, wipe my lips, and pretend that I hadn't eaten cold rice.</p>
<p>The person who came in surprised me. She was carrying a basket, and said with a scolding yet kind face:</p>
<p>"You're leaving tomorrow, and others don't say hello, why don't you even pay attention to your grandmother! Alas! Young people are reckless in doing things. If I hadn't come this morning and you weren't in the house, seeing your packed luggage, I wouldn't have known that you were really leaving tomorrow..."</p>
<p>I took the basket from her hand, smiling and silent, and also condemned myself for being confused in doing things.</p>
<p>The lid of the box was lifted, and a fragrant and sweet heat sprayed out. I jumped up happily and took my grandmother's hand. She looked at me with a sad smile:</p>
<p>"Eat it! It's hot, just like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." Yes, "Just like this, I don't know when you'll be back..." These were my grandmother's words, this sentence is very familiar, I have heard it more than once. It seems that she has said this to both her daughter and her son. She sent her daughter to another world, and let her two sons go far to the border. She often said to me: Wang Sanjie guarded her husband (Xue Pinggui) for eighteen years, when will she wait to guard her sons? Thinking of her sons, she burst into tears and asked me to write letters for her. There seemed to be a lot of words in the letter, but in the final analysis, it was nothing more than telling them to come back quickly. She missed them, she thought, they should also be thinking of her. After sealing the letter, she pressed me to go to the post office and watched it being put into the mailbox with her own eyes. In fact, this letter had nowhere to go, it would just fall into the hands of a stranger and be torn up, this is what I thought in my heart, but I never had the courage to say it.</p>
<p>Now she is going to send off her only granddaughter again, without much sadness; only a silent sigh....</p>
<p>She looked at the cold cake that had wrinkles from being exposed to the air and told me to eat more, wishing she could stuff it all into my stomach.</p>
<p>In the dim light, these two lonely people sat opposite each other, one old and one young. Heaven seemed to have deliberately arranged for the two of us to coincide together. You pity me, and I care about you.</p>
<p>In the misty dawn, we began to part. Before getting on the car, she still urged me tightly: "Write to me!" I nodded knowingly, but looking at her trembling lips, I didn't hear a single idiom...</p>
<p>The street lights gradually went out from dim to bright in the morning light. Turning my head, in front of me was a blue sky and a vast plain. I don't know when, the army is about to be hundreds of miles away.</p>
<h3>Evening</h3>
<p>— Kunyang</p>
<p>Watching the ceiling darkened by cooking smoke,</p>
<p>The color of the street is desolate, cold and deep,</p>
<p>A string of whistles sounded,</p>
<p>It is the crows returning from their tired travels,</p>
<p>Light flowed out from the gap in someone's window,</p>
<p>You should go back too</p>
<p>However, where is my home?</p>
<h3>Autumn</h3>
<p>— Kunyang</p>
<p>The eaves are crying,</p>
<p>The window bridge sighs,</p>
<p>Even the parasol tree is haggard for you,</p>
<p>Harboring how much sorrow,</p>
<p>Such a heart-wrenching feeling?</p>
<h3>The Story of a Bicycle</h3>
<p>— Lan Ying</p>
<p>Written for the "Traffic Safety Campaign"</p>
<p>Tao Sheng's father bought a new bicycle, but after using it for less than a week, he took it to sell again and exchanged it for a seven- or eight-year-old used bicycle.</p>
<p>It turned out that after secretly calculating, his father felt that at this time and place, riding a bicycle was much more convenient than taking the tram, and from an economic and spiritual point of view, paying for tickets in small amounts and being crowded or yelled at in the tram all the time were more worthwhile. He wanted to buy a bicycle for his eldest daughter, Tao Sheng, who left early and returned late, but he couldn't scrape together so much money at once. So, in a moment of thought, he sold his own brand new bicycle and bought a half-new one. He gave the extra money to Tao Sheng and told her to look for and buy one herself within the amount of this money. Father's love is great.</p>
<p>With a heart of gratitude and reverence, coupled with unspeakable happiness, Tao Sheng began to ask her friends everywhere, seeking a suitable bicycle. Two weeks later, she was finally introduced by a colleague to meet a Mr. Shi, and with Mr. Shi's enthusiastic guidance, she finally agreed on a used bicycle that was said to be "of good origin." However, although it was used, it was very useful. One day, in September, the wild chrysanthemums kissed the setting sun in a drunken embrace. It was a bright near-dusk. Mr. Shi came to visit Tao Sheng.</p>
<p>"Mr. Shi, I had an accident when I went out this morning. There's something wrong with the bike. It keeps making rattling noises when I pedal it. I was just about to go out to repair it!"</p>
<p>Generally, the first time people meet, they become acquainted through singing, and after that, they always like to talk about singing. Similarly, as soon as Tao Sheng saw Mr. Shi, the words about the bicycle blurted out without thinking.</p>
<p>"Did you not hurt yourself? What happened?" Mr. Shi asked.</p>
<p>"It's also because I was riding too fast, but I can't blame myself entirely. When the bike passed the Gaoshan Road intersection, there was a crowd of people waiting for the tram. There were always thirty to fifty people or more. As I was pedaling past, ringing the bell all the way, a man suddenly squeezed out from the side, standing numbly in the middle of the road, still asking, "Has the tram come yet?" My bike couldn't stop in time, and I was afraid of hitting the man, so I threw myself onto the tram tracks." Tao Sheng is an innocent and mischievous girl, and she was gesturing as she spoke. After speaking roughly, there was still a sigh of annoyance between her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"Let me take the bike back and repair it for you.——Don't you believe I can fix it well?" Mr. Shi said, and gave a polite smile. Tao Sheng was very unwilling to let him take it to repair, because if it was repaired well, she would owe him a favor, and if it wasn't repaired well, she couldn't complain, and it would only delay time in vain. However, he had said it first, and if she didn't let him repair it, it would seem that she didn't believe he could fix it well, and it would make him unable to step down immediately. She had no choice but to give the bike to him.</p>
<p>An amateur trainee is not a professional technician after all. Because the body parts were not properly aligned, Tao Sheng fell again and almost let a passing truck...</p>
<p>In addition to being frustrated, Tao Sheng couldn't help but blame Mr. Shi.</p>
<p>As for Mr. Shi, the joy in his heart aroused ten times his diligence, and he became even more ingratiating.</p>
<p>One day, Tao Sheng pushed her bicycle out of the office and met Mr. Shi at the door. Mr. Shi was also riding a bicycle and accompanied her home all the way. On the way, he repeatedly invited her to have tea and rest, and could not resist Tao Sheng's repeated refusals. He came up with some other topics to talk about. Talking is like writing an article. If you talk well, you are clear, concise, and to the point. If you don't talk well, it's a mess, and you especially can't attract people's attention. In the end, you even confuse yourself. So, you don't look at the red lights or the green lights, and you don't care if there are cars in front or beside you...</p>
<p>"Crash..."——A bicycle crashed into a policeman's stone platform, and the bike finally lay on the asphalt road, and the owner sprawled on the ground. A three-wheeled car sped past beside him, taking away a piece of skin from his arm. A rickshaw behind him inexcusably pulled over the bicycle.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "There is one, there is two, there must be three!" Tao Sheng had fallen twice, and this time even she herself thought that it was bound to be her turn to cause trouble.</p>
<p>However, in fact, it was Mr. Shi who was injured, not her. This time, Mr. Shi's ankle was broken!</p>
<p>Tao Sheng returned home and didn't say a word for a long time. Later, she seriously said to her father: "Father, we must never ride too fast when we ride our bikes in the future, especially don't talk to people on the bike, and we should always check our bikes for any problems, otherwise it's too dangerous. The road is like a tiger's mouth."</p>
<p>Father nodded.</p>
<p>From then on, Tao Sheng was cautious and careful. However, who dares to say that there are no careless cyclists on the road!</p>

<h3>Shanghai News Cup Basketball League: Recent Situations of Groups A and B</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Cup Basketball League, for both Groups A and B, is shaping up well. After a one-week suspension, it will resume today as scheduled. Below are recent situation analyses for each section of Group A and Group B, which team members and fans can use as a guide.</p>
<p>Group A: China Union Drug Factory Leads the Pack</p>
<p>China Union Drug Factory has won all six of its matches, remaining the only undefeated team, making them the top contender for the championship. Following closely behind is Zhongbei Shantai Team, with only one loss. Dahua and Huanan, each with two losses, still have a chance to strive for the top. Mingxing, Renyu, Tongren, and Huaying will compete for higher rankings. V, having suffered repeated defeats, seems destined for last place. Attached is the situation table:</p>
<p>Group B Section 1: Renyu and Lusheng are Evenly Matched</p>
<p>In Group B Section 1, Renyu and Lusheng are evenly matched, both currently on winning streaks. The two teams also met in the Morning Friends Cup, where Lusheng won by a significant margin. Renyu has strengthened its lineup for this competition, determined to avenge that defeat and win the section championship. Chengfu is highly motivated, while Zhongxing and Fanjiang seem less capable.</p>
<p>Group B Section 2: Dahua and China Storage are Strong Contenders</p>
<p>In this section, the Fatty Team and China Storage Team have both won all three of their matches, while Dahua B has won all two of its matches, all progressing simultaneously. In terms of actual strength, Dahua seems to have a slight advantage, but the Fatty Team players have rich experience, and may have clever strategies to defeat their opponents. Therefore, the top spot in Section 2 will definitely be contested by these two teams. China Storage also enjoys a strong reputation in the banking industry, making this section the most exciting and competitive.</p>
<p>Group B Section 3: The Flying Team is Brilliant; The Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) is Promising</p>
<p>The Flying Team has won all four of its matches in Section 3, making their future bright. The YMCA, with fewer matches played, also remains undefeated. The YMCA's recent performance has shown great progress, having won other Group B league championships. It is possible that they could stand out and surpass the Flying Team. The Feihong team has yet to win a match and is currently at the bottom.</p>
<p>Group B Section 4: Moore Wins All, Shantai Follows Closely</p>
<p>Shantai Team continues the style of Group A, presenting a particularly excellent performance. They are indeed a rare team in Group B. They still have two matches to play, so they should be ranked after Moore, who has won all four matches. However, when Shantai meets Moore, the latter may find it difficult to withstand their attacks. Shantai is generally considered the most promising, followed by Moore. The Bombing Team is mediocre and unlikely to develop, while Xiafeng still has potential.</p>
<p>Group B Section 5: The Morning Friends (Blue) Team Stands Out</p>
<p>The teams in Section 5 are the most evenly matched. Zhenyuan, for example, has lost two matches in a row, but only by a small margin. Tie Fu also suffered a crushing defeat, but still has hope for the future. The Morning Friends (Blue) team currently stands out from the crowd, but there are many hidden reefs ahead, so they must proceed with caution. The team has veterans like Wang Lidu and Wang Cunrui, which should make it easier for them to develop. Linglong is the weakest team in terms of strength.</p>
<p>Group B Section 6: Zhongbei and Lingyou will Fight for the Championship</p>
<p>In this section, the team with the most hope for last place is likely to be Qiangshi and Jianyi. It should be noted that Qiangshi is purely organized by teachers and staff from a school, which is unique in Shanghai. Although their basketball skills are inferior, this point is still worth mentioning. The leader of this section is likely to be Zhongbei, influenced by Group A team members. Moreover, with skilled players like Mu Shiyan, there is high hope that they will surpass Lingyou and seize the top spot.</p>
<p>Overall, Group B has not yet reached a critical stage. The competition resumes today, and all subsequent matches will be increasingly crucial. It is predicted that all the young heroes will be ready for battle, hoping to win the section championship. After the section champions are determined, they will still need to compete for the overall championship, with the elite from the six sections facing off. This may be no less exciting than the Group A competition, and may also produce many rising stars.</p>
<p>Competition Resumes Today After a Week-Long Break</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Cup will resume today as scheduled, with the same order as before. However, the matches originally scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of next week will be made up for the three days of suspension this week. The order will then be adjusted accordingly, except for Sundays. There are many exciting Group A matches next week, with the Dahua vs. Mingxing game on Monday being a highlight. The latter has been diligently practicing, and their basketball skills have been improving daily, which will pose a threat to Dahua.</p>
<p>China Union vs. Shantai Showdown on Wednesday</p>
<p>The China Union vs. Shantai match on Wednesday the 12th) has been the talk of the town for basketball fans. Some say China Union is sure to win, while others say that Shantai, having suffered a crushing defeat to Huanan, has been working hard to avenge the defeat. It is said that Shantai has been actively arranging friendly matches with various teams and discussing strategies at the club, showing their ambition. China Union has maintained a consistent spirit from beginning to end, with scheduled practice. Fans should arrive early on the day to avoid disappointment, as the venue is small and has limited capacity.</p>
<p>Two Exciting Group A Games on Friday</p>
<p>On Friday, one Group A match is between Huaying and Mingxing. The former is a movie star team, while the latter's Mingxing is organized by employees of the Mingxing Perfume Factory, hence the name. Both teams have been performing well, but both have recently had the same weakness: difficulty getting a full team together. However, this match is crucial for their rankings, and they will both do their best to compete. The other match is between Zhongbei and Dahua, which is also expected to be a sensation. Zhongbei's performance has a large following, and Dahua is undoubtedly a top-tier team. Moreover, both teams have many veterans with long-standing reputations in the basketball world, each with experience and unique skills. The performance is expected to be excellent.</p>
<h3>Preview of the East China vs. Portuguese Business Soccer League Match This Morning</h3>
<p>Today at 10:00 AM, the East China vs. Portuguese Business match at Yiyuan is expected to be one of the most exciting matches since the start of the season. When two strong teams meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. Moreover, this year's competition adopts a single round-robin system, where wins and losses affect the future of the championship. Both sides will be more cautious to strive for victory. Therefore, in addition to strength, intelligence is also needed. The team with the better strategy and tactics will win.</p>
<p>The Portuguese Business Team's Lineup is Fierce and Intimidating</p>
<p>The Portuguese Business team's lineup has been announced and has been slightly adjusted from the friendly match against Lianyi in the Welfare Cup. Veteran hero Costantin has been moved to left midfield, while Bauhio has been moved to center defense, and rising star Camabolro has been assigned to left wing. With this adjustment, the defense line is solid and formidable, and the forwards are also fierce and intimidating. In recent days, they have been working hard to prepare for the battle. East China has no choice but to face this strong enemy. However, I am worried about whether they can emerge victorious. East China's performance in recent matches has not been ideal. Except for Dai Linjing, the other veterans are not in good form. If Li Ning and Sun Jinshun cannot restore their peak performance from the end of last season, then this battle will be difficult, which is worrying!</p>
<p>Clamping Down on Foun is the Key to Victory</p>
<p>In terms of forwards, Portuguese Business is better than East China in the center. Foun is an excellent right winger in Shanghai, with fast dribbling, passing, and shooting. He is a dangerous person in the Portuguese team. A-Liang and Li Ning are no match for him in terms of speed. This player should not be confronted head-on. Instead, they should observe the ball's position, stand in the appropriate position, and attack him from both sides. With Liang and Li's experience and full effort, they may be able to curb his fierceness. Tan Fuhen, in addition to intercepting in midfield, should often retreat to assist in defense to compensate for Liang and Li's shortcomings. If Foun is contained, the Portuguese team's right-wing attack will be greatly weakened, and the overall situation will be stabilized. After Costantin gets the ball as the left midfielder, he should remember not to dribble too much. He should look for opportunities to pass the ball forward, and then run with the ball for thirty yards until he is exhausted, and then advance. Costantin is old. Although he has rich experience, his stamina cannot match the young guys.</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun's recent performance has been poor, and he is expected to make an effort to improve. He should pay special attention to V. Su Ruozhi's long shots. Zhang Lingen should not go out too far and should closely monitor Su Ruo without giving him any slack. If Su Ruo reduces his activity, then the Portuguese team's right-wing attack will not be so intimidating.</p>
<p>In short, this battle is a contest of intelligence and strength. With the strong spirit of the East China players and their united front, if they can fight steadily step by step, then although the Portuguese are tough, they are not invincible. Encourage and hope!</p>
<h3>More Than a Hundred Athletes Participate in Sports Meet</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA Sports Department hosted the Shanghai Autumn Sports Meet at the Russian Overseas Chinese Sports Association's new track and field on Taishan Road and Wuxing Road (near Wenlin Road) this morning at 9:00 AM. A total of 111 male and female athletes participated. Shanghai's track and field stars, such as sprinter Zhu Shafei, javelin thrower Wang Xuewu, long jumper Liu Dekuan, high jumper Li Zhenzhong, discus thrower Guo Qichang, shot putter Guan Hongda, and long-distance runners Wang Zhenglin and Lou Wenao, all attended. This is an unprecedented grand event for track and field in Shanghai after the war. There will also be group calisthenics performed by the YMCA Middle School performance group, various Chinese martial arts and wrestling performances by the Jingwu Sports Association, the Minsheng National Arts Research Society, the News Daily National Arts Class, and the YMCA. YMCA fitness group will perform weightlifting and bodybuilding exercises. Famous national arts teachers Tong Zhongyi and Yu Fuhong were also invited to the venue to perform their lifelong skills. The conference was enthusiastically sponsored by YMCA member Zhang Yixiang, who covered the expenses and collected many prizes from various parties. (Happy)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>The Tie Fu football and basketball team set off for Nantong this Monday to raise funds for winter relief in the area. The four female celebrities of the "Four Sisters" also accompanied them. The entire team is scheduled to return to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>After the Morning Friends Cup, it is said that there will be a Bank Cup, limited to bank employees. Xie Yiqin of the Salt Industry Bank is very enthusiastic. Xie was the backbone of the previous Banking Friendship Association basketball league. This revival is also due to the fact that the lives of bank employees are too dull.</p>
<p>Zhengxing Girls' Middle School initiated and hosted the Zhengxing Cup Shanghai Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship. The regulations were drafted by committee member Chen Linsheng. A committee meeting will be held at the school today at 3:00 PM, and advisors (the "King of Balls") are welcome.</p>
