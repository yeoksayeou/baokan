<h3>培里琉東方海面肉搏奇襲敵船團　日大本營發表魚雷挺身隊戰果</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日下午四時發表：日魚雷挺身隊，十月二十八日未明，對培里琉島東方海面之敵運輸船團，作肉搏奇襲，擊沉其四艘，擊毁其二艘。又與此相呼應突入該島北岸之肉搏突擊隊，亦作奇襲登陸成功。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　中部太平洋日軍，爲呼應日神風特別攻擊機隊之奮戰，刻仍繼續勇戰奮鬥中，其在帛琉羣島培里琉島方面，於九月十五日敵軍登陸以來，即連日連夜分別以魚雷挺身隊肉搏攻擊隊從事作戰，充分發揮日軍獨有之强烈精神，使敵不寒而慄，而帛琉島日陸海軍部隊，亦對奮戰力鬥之培里琉島日軍，盡其一切之協力。另一方面敵亦傾其全力，向培里琉島從事補給，以呼應對菲律賓作戰。於二十七日更以運輸船約十八艘（包括大型運輸船十艘），在該島東岸作必死之登陸作戰，帛琉島日海軍部隊，於偵悉敵軍此種行動後，即以魚雷挺身隊及肉搏隊於二十八日實行突擊，以呼應神風特別攻擊機隊，其中魚雷挺身隊在培里琉島東方海面，曾收穫擊沉敵運輸船四艘，擊毁敵運輸船二艘之偉大戰果，肉搏隊則在培里琉島北岸發動奇襲登陸已吿成功之敵軍，堆目下仍在激戰中。</p>
<p>中央社訊　日魚雷隊在培里琉島東方海面擊沉敵美接濟登陸部隊之運輸船團，詳情如下：</p>
<p>十一月一日下午四時，日軍大本營發表，日軍魚雷挺身隊，在十月二十八日天未明，於培里琉島東方海面，對敵美之運輸船團加以奇襲，而得擊沉四隻及擊毁四隻之大戰果，此外與呼應之遠藤谷司海軍中佐所率領之突擊隊乘舟艇突入培里琉島北岸，予敵以重創，此次奇襲作戰，於全戰局觀之，亦極爲重要也。（一）遮斷雷伊泰灣敵軍之糧食補給路綫，幷使麥克沃塞之部隊陷於孤立之境，幷進而對已入敵手之太平洋島嶼表示總反攻之決意，幷以培里琉島遮斷菲島及婆羅州等敵軍目標地，以此三十平方公里之狹隘孤島，而爲二萬人之血戰場所，乃爲日本將士之獨特戰法，而此次奇襲使自安格維爾島方面增援之敵軍三師均吿全滅。（二）魚雷挺身隊之於海中，誠如神風特別攻擊隊之於空中，實乃日本民族之壯烈之祖國防衛精神之具體化，足使敵方戰慄也，而敵國之運輸船團，乃商船之臨時改裝，而其航空母艦亦組裝濫造，故以代表日本國魂之此種魚雷及炸彈，而施前代未聞之壯烈攻擊，使敵艦無一悻免，而足令英美二國呆然也。</p>
<h3>日神風攻擊機隊發揮武士道精神　在菲島東英勇作戰詳情</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日神風特別攻擊機隊等新銳機隊，際茲菲律賓一帶日·美展開一大決戰之秋，澈底發揮其武士道精神，連日猛攻菲律賓東方海面及雷伊泰灣敵機動部隊及其運輸船團，予始終執拗之敵人以莫大打擊，迄今所獲戰果，業經日大本營於三十一日發表，茲分誌各該隊之戰鬥詳情如次。</p>
<p>二十五日　（一）神風特別攻擊機隊及敷島隊，於正午時分，在斯爾安峽東方用拼撞戰術，以二架擊沉敵巨型空母一艘，以一架撞毁敵中型空母一艘，復以一架拼撞而擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘。（二）另外一隊神風特別攻擊機隊，上午於斯黎高東方若干海里處，圍攻擁有空母之敵機動部隊，排除敵護衛機之阻害，撞中敵制式空母一艘，將其炸毁。又另外一隊攻擊隊之一部，亦出動殲敵，以全部均未歸還，故難判明戰果，想收穫定不在少。</p>
<p>二十六日　神風特別攻擊隊，是午零時半，於斯黎高東方若干海里處，圍攻擁有空母四艘之敵機動部隊，排除敵護衛機，巨人型戰鬥機約六十餘架之阻害及熾烈高射砲火，作必中之突擊，以兩架撞中敵大型空母一艘，使其艦體全部爲烈炸包圍，日掩護機確見其沉沒，別有一架撞中敵空母之艦橋旁甲板，使其作約四十度傾斜，日掩護機旋見其又行復原</p>
<p>二十七日　（一）神風特別攻擊機隊及純忠隊，於下午七時許，突入雷伊泰灣區，炸停泊之敵艦船，以天色黑暗，難以鑑別敵艦之艦型，指揮官某大尉即有意對敵艦攻擊，但因受敵戰鬥機之阻害，不能與僚機聯絡，結果，該指揮官機及直接掩護機之一部，不得已飛返基地，其失去聯絡之第二架，第三架，則已作拼撞攻擊，一架撞中敵運輸船，使其立即起火爆炸，而行沉沒，其他一架之戰果，惜尚未能判明。（二）神風特別攻擊隊突擊隊，於掩護機協同下，於午後六時許，對停泊雷伊泰灣內之敵艦隊加以攻擊，光頭一架，首先撞中敵戰艦後部，將其炸毁，第二架撞中巡洋艦，亦將之炸毁，第三架於突擊中途中彈，結果撞中敵大型運輸船尾部。是日薄暮，曾突入雷伊泰灣內，因確認困難與掩護機共同飛返基地。</p>
<p>二十八日　純忠隊之指揮官，於上午四時頃單機自基地出發，對雷伊泰灣內之敵艦作勇敢攻擊，因未協同掩護機，故無法確認戰果。</p>
<p>二十九日　於拉孟灣東方若干里海上，發現以空母四艘（內大型三艘），戰艦二艘至四艘及其他巡洋艦，驅逐艦等，共計二十餘艘編成之敵艦隊，日神風特別攻擊隊，當即出動施以猛攻，內中一架撞中敵空母一艘艦橋附近，當即起炸，其他一艘艦型不明者及巡洋艦一艘，亦被撞中起火，因被敵護衛機防碍關係，未能確認命中</p>
<p>卅日午前　神風特別撞擊隊，接到斯爾安島東南海面發現敵機動部隊，企圖侵入雷伊泰灣之情報，敵機動部隊係以巨型空母二艘，中型空母一艘，戰艦一艘及其他艦船多艘編隊，日神風特別攻擊隊由某基地趕到，施以猛炸後，內三架撞中敵大型空母一艘，使之起火，旋即沉沒，內中一架，撞中敵中型空母一艘，使之起火，又一架撞中敵小型空母一艘，其他情况因大型空母烟火過密，未能確認，又另外一架，撞中敵戰艦艦尾，亦使之負傷。</p>
<h3>遠藤長官談神風隊已握V一操縱力</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日軍需省航空兵器總局長官遠藤中將，頃發表談話，其大意謂，神風特別攻擊隊發動後，敵美聞風喪胆，目前德方以V一號流星彈襲擊英國，尚不能轉變戰局之要素，其弊在缺乏操縱力，故我方鑒於盟邦事實之教訓，必須造成有操縱力之V一號，且評論謂V一號威力雖大，然總乏明確之目標，必具有正確之操縱力，但此操縱力恐任何國家亦難使其實現，但此次日軍特別攻擊隊，竟已使其完全成功，日本之V一號，於茲遂即完全發揮其勢力矣，今後再使美軍恐怖之武器，必更將繼續出現。</p>
<p>菲律賓日軍基地一日中央社電　據十月三十一日正午日機隊偵察雷伊泰灣方面之報吿，該方面停有敵巡洋艦，驅逐艦十數艘（內有戰艦數艘），證實約六十艘之敵運輸船，因連日受日神風特別攻擊隊及日機隊之猛攻，其大半皆已傾斜沉沒。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>社會事業與安老問題</h3>
<p>近來言社會事業者，最容易被忽視的，恐怕要算是安老事業了。因爲一般人存有一種錯誤的見解，以爲敬老安老，只是一種舊思想或消極的慈善事業，有人努力固然好，沒有人辦也與社會前途無礙。其實，這種觀念，正是今日民間風氣敗壞和社會不安的原因之一。要知道敬老安老，原是我國古代道德的最高原則，「大道之行」，就在要求實現「不獨親其親」的理想，因有「老吾老以及人之老」及「老者安之」之說，孟子亦以敬老爲「三達尊」之一。歷代政府都有尊老之勸，養老之典；社會上也蔚然流傳一種敬重老人的風氣，至今在內地城鄉間尚往往可見，保留高尚淳厚的習俗。可是一到通商口岸各大城市，敬老養老之說，多被目爲迂腐，以致人盡逐臭，祗重勢利，結果風氣敗壞，道德凋零。這是一個當前的社會問題。</p>
<p>本報有鑒於此，特於慈幼問題座談會之後，復召集「安老問題座談會」，一方面聚本市各安老社團代表及慈善耆宿於一堂，各抒宏論，集中意見，以便改善及推進安老運動，一方面也希望藉此喚起社會各界對於安老問題的重視，我們相信，受益的決不止於孤苦無依的老人，對於人心世道，對於社會，都有其重大的意義。</p>
<p>如何使「老有所安」，各國政府，大都有一定的政策，有固定的經費和組織；同時社會上也有各種組織完善規模宏大的安老事業。我國凡百落後，當然不足與相比擬。不過社會上一向不乏志士仁人，努力於此，尤以宗教界之努力，最可讚美。即以本市而論，若安老院，若新普育堂之老人院，無論在規模方面，組織方面，養護方面，只要是曾經前往參觀過的，當無不讚美的。不過從大體上說，全市安老團體，總計不過十二所，其中除天主教師辦的二所以外，收容的老人，數額有逐漸減少的趨勢，其主要原因，無非由於物價迭漲，開支日增，無法維持；就以天主教所辦的二所而論，安老院雖仍有三百多名，但是就現在經濟現况而論，究能維持至何日，確成問題；至於新普育堂，從前收容苦難老幼殘廢達三千餘人，其中男女老殘所占數字不小，現尚留院的只能維持一百五十餘人。其餘基督教所辦的五所，及慈善團體所軹的五所，環境更爲艱苦，所收老人的生活，更不能與安老院比擬。被收容救助的尚有如是情况，未被收容救助的老病孤寡，更不知有多少！我們只要稍一留心街頭巷尾哀泣於泥塗甚至餓死道旁的；可說觸目皆有。誰無父母，忍其流落？我們不能不在這裏呼籲有關當局尤其是各界有識善士共起而圖救助之道。</p>
<p>關於濟助孤苦老人問題，這次安老問題座談會上，曾有具體切實的結論。（請參閱今日本報第三版安老問題座談會紀錄），我們深覺尚有特別提供於有關當局及社會領袖者，有如次各點：</p>
<p>第一，關於現有安老團體之改善及維持者，趙希明先生曾在座談會上提議的三點，非常切合事實。希望各團體主持人能摒除成見，特別重視。不過其中第三點，希望於天主教所辦二所者，似乎早已實現了。我們希望其他團體多去參觀，採取修女姆姆們所行的辦法，特別學習她們那種犧牲服務的精神。但我們更熱烈盼望各界對現有各團體盡力協助，使能維持和改善，更進一步以求擴充收養的名額。</p>
<p>第二，關於一般老年人的生活改善問題，這次安老座談會曾提出營養，治療，生產，休憇等問題，朱，丁，徐諸老暢申卓見，我們希望各界父老們不分貧富男女，都能特別加以注意，即爲人子女者，也可參考而爲奉侍其父母尊長的基本原則。</p>
<p>第三，爲求普遍敬老安老，以期轉變風氣起見，同時仍有賴於政府當局及各界領袖之盡力倡導。對於政府機關學校公私團體下及廠商服務人員，推行年功加俸及老年退休優恤等辦法，而社會方面如醫療，交通機關，娛樂場所等，尤當特定優待老人辦法，造成敬老安老的環境，我們深信，這種舉指，對於未來社會的復興，具有重大的意義。</p>

<h3>日政府設置綜合計劃局</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日政府一日發表，植場鐵三氏任綜合計劃局長，松田，擇積，管三氏爲部長，另有參事官，理事官等人選，至其餘人選，將由新局長決定後發表。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日政府以決戰業已開始，茲爲發揮戰力，期綜合並統一國策，決置輔佐內閣總理大臣之簡素機關，三十一日發表設立要綱如次：（一）名稱，綜合計劃局，（二）管轄與增强國力有關之企劃，調整統一及綜合考查之事項，（三）爲辦理上項事務，特設置第一·二·三等三部，（四）各長官及部長，均以勅任官待遇。</p>
<h3>菲島前綫　日陸軍機隊綜合戰果　擊沉擊毁大批敵艦</h3>
<p>馬尼刺一日中央社電　美軍於雷伊泰灣登陸後，連日展開激戰，至三十日僅日陸軍航空部隊所獲綜合戰果，即擊沉巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或大型驅逐艦十艘，驅逐艦一艘，運輸船六艘，登陸用舟艇十五艘。擊毁空母一艘，戰艦三艘，戰艦或巡洋艦三艘，巡洋艦一艘，驅逐艦十艘，運輸船十二艘，登陸用舟艇數艘，艦型不明多艘。中彈起火者，運輸船四十四艘，登陸用舟艇數艘，艦型不明者一艘。擊落擊破敵機確實者十一架，不確實者十架，擊毁（包含地上者）七十七架，登陸地點起火者九處，飛機場設施起火者二十五處，擊毁探照燈陣地兩所，高射砲陣地兩所。</p>
<p>馬尼刺一日中央社電　敵軍雖遭日軍機隊之反覆猛攻，然仍於雷伊泰島登陸地點執拗推進，其航空基地據二十九日晨日軍偵察隊之報吿，曾見塔克羅班機場有P38型機十架，並有一架於空中哨戒外，並察知必阿克島方面有一部機隊進駐，更於桑巴布羅機場置有建設基地所用之車輛，刻正從事整備。</p>
<p>早野少尉目擊談</p>
<p>菲律賓前綫一日中央社電　關於日前菲律賓東方之大海戰，日陸軍航空隊早野少尉，曾談述如次：當時上空多雲，下望不能十分清晰，實屬遺憾，是日余等爲偵察雷伊泰灣敵登陸地點而出發，航行中見於遠方之航綫上有黑點，此我軍之艦隊也，航空母艦　威風凜凜，空中飛有衛護之艦戰機，前頭之我空軍，乃先制攻擊隊，余之態度亦爲之嚴肅，默禱我艦隊之勝利，時遙遙之遠方上空飛來之敵機隊，已早與我空軍在太平洋上展開決戰，擊墜之敵機，曳黑烟盤旋下墮，我軍巨砲彈連續在空中爆炸，敵軍魚雷機被火燄包圍墜毁海內，餘在雲間飛行，斷雲之處，望見我軍正確之巨砲已在怒吼，敵艦隊亦分明於目下，敵航空母艦有傾斜者，有沉沒者，瞬間數艘敵巡洋艦已被炸裂，敵軍恐怖我軍攻擊，發高射砲彈以衛護其航空母艦，時上空飛翔之敵艦戰機，已早爲我空軍擊敗，其航空母艦已傾斜，其他艦船亦漸被毁沉於海底，終至覆滅，余冒惡氣流繼續偵察於上空，而在飄動中望見此大戰果，欣歡感動，已難以自持矣。</p>
<h3>敵機一架偵察東京</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　一日下午一時許，有自馬里亞納附近基地起飛之敵B29型機一架，侵入東京上空，一時半頃即向東南方遁去，敵機並未投下炸彈。爰敵以菲律賓方面戰况由於日陸海空軍一體之猛烈反攻，徒作龐大損耗，侵入作戰，幷未能如意進展，料此次敵機侵入東京，乃爲牽制日軍反攻，加之美大總統選舉，將於七日舉行，此事具有政略上之意圖，爲偵察而來者。</p>
<h3>日機夜襲芬尼機塲</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫基地一日中央社電　緬甸方面日機隊，曾於二十九日夜再襲孟加拉東部芬尼敵機場，是役敵陸上停放飛機兩架中彈起火，其他諸設施亦受重創，日機全部安返基地。</p>
<h3>史蒂威爾被召回眞相　渝共失和使美失望</h3>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　關於美駐渝軍總司令史蒂威爾辭職事，美政府於三十一日假合衆及美聯通訊社，暴露事實之經緯。據合衆社新德里訊，史蒂威爾之回國，至今始發表，其起因則遠於兩月前，哈雷少將及納爾遜抵重慶之時。美國統帥部爲在東亞作急速之反攻，乃賦兩人以最大之權限，要求重慶協力美軍，以期增强對日之作戰力。據合衆社確訊，美政府事實上，已以停止援助重慶爲威嚇手段。同時爲避免誤解暨正確之報吿，美政府最後已緩和態度，維持渝方體面，作懷柔政策。衆料召回史蒂威爾，美國要求國共合作，使兩軍協力對日抗戰。哈雷及納爾遜曾聲稱，重慶及延安不能和解，已使美政府失望。</p>
<p>美政府所要求者，爲（一）改組重慶國民政府，罷免排外份子。（二）不獨緬甸戰綫，即其他戰綫之重要戰事，亦應任命</p>
<p>美軍將校爲司令等，以此種强力之條件提向渝方。同時羅斯福亦特致親筆書予蔣介石，在交涉中，蔣曾間接承認華中重要戰綫渝軍司令之一部調動，必不可能。其他條件，雖已同意，但國民政府解散或改組一項，則已拒絕。又據美聯社重慶特派員，白里千最近回國談稱，史蒂威爾之回國，乃東亞美軍統帥與蔣</p>
<p>意見分裂之表現，史蒂威爾之回國，諸多紛爭，由此可見羅斯福將使重慶之改組，及抗戰力之加强責任，委諸蔣介石。史蒂威爾回國時，駐渝美大使高斯亦提出辭呈，高氏始終主張以强硬態度對渝。彼認爲史蒂威爾回國，乃美國在渝地位之覆滅。</p>
<p>史蒂威爾與蔣衝突</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據華盛頓電，美總統羅斯福於三十一會見記者宣稱，召還史蒂威爾非爲政爭問題，史蒂威爾在其責任上確已收穫偉大成果，但其與蔣介石間之衝突，則爲一失敗。</p>

<p>廣西前線一日中央社電　日軍精銳攻陷靈田街後，繼續進攻，二十九日晨到達俯瞰桂林平原之東方高地。三十日於桂林東方與渝軍展開激戰。又另一部日軍，二十九日迫近靈川東方四公里地帶，排除渝軍憑恃數條高深之陣地，以迫擊砲及重火器之頑强抵抗，於是日夜將靈川佔領，繼續追擊渝軍。一方向桂林飛機塲進攻之日軍，二十九日上午十時突入桂林陽朔公路要衝大圩，（桂林東南十五公里），對桂林直接防衛軍，及盤據於平樂陽朔之渝第三十七集團軍之後方聯絡線，予以重大威脅。</p>
<p>桂林市郊兩軍交戰</p>
<p>衡陽一日中央社電，據桂林郊外日軍報道班員來電稱，廣西日軍某部隊已於三十日夜進迫桂林東北外廓之渝軍陣地，現正激戰中。蓋日　　十月上旬進至廣西省境後，即先後攻略湘桂鐵路要衝之全縣·興安等地，並續向桂林挺進。至上月二十九日傍晚，即擊破渝軍第九三軍之二師，佔領桂林前衛據點靈川，三十日再猛進六十里，於是日晚十時二十五分進抵桂林新市街北方，現正與渝軍第六十集團軍司令韋雲淞所部，三十一軍二師激戰中。又其他日軍部隊亦於三十日進迫桂林市外南方陣地象鳳山。</p>
<p>廣西一日中央社電　日軍於二十九日晨，突入靈田街後，仍繼續猛進。渝軍則死守楊安契（桂林東北八公里，）至杜山（楊安契東北十公里）是役日軍實行猛攻，至三十日遂予以擊潰。</p>
<p>佔領富川渝軍退却</p>

<p>華南前綫基地一日中央社電　據抵達當地消息稱，數日來南寗柳州兩機塲曾有美艦戰機數十架飛來。按此不外因過去於台灣菲律賓海戰時，美艦多數被擊沉擊毀，此等艦戰機無法飛回母艦不得已而飛來者，唯此等飛還美機寥寥數十架。由此可推斷其餘大部份已皆與海艦遭同樣命運，故美軍此次所受損失實相當重大云。</p>
<p>日軍攻擊渝軍戰果</p>
<p>華南最前綫一日中央社電　於西江左岸進擊中之廣西日軍，近曾於桂平北方三十公里之新墟，至同地西方十五公里三江墟間之丘陵地帶，構築陣地。並於二十八日晨，開始對渝第四戰區之直轄獨立第二團約二千之衆，加以正面攻擊。其他有力部隊更迂迴至渝軍背後，將其退路遮斷，兩部隊互相呼應，加以猛攻。按此正面渝军係張發奎部隊，持有山砲迫擊砲機關砲等優秀裝備，並有美人官長指示。至三十日日軍所獲戰果主要者如次：渝軍遺棄屍體約二百名，（內有參謀及營長等，）日軍鹵獲兵器計重山砲二，迫擊砲一，機關砲六，重機槍六，輕機槍九，及其他兵器多數。</p>

<h3>南匯社會的透視</h3>
<p>— 逸飛</p>
<p>記者前次通信中，曾將南滙概况　，略事報道，茲再將南滙社會的各方面情形再行敘述如次：</p>
<p>按南滙縣爲上海市屬縣區中較大的一縣，也是內政部指定爲模範縣的一縣。從外表看來，是擁有廣大的區域，　　的人口，豐富的出產。但注視她的內層，就立刻會發現她內在的病態，千瘡百孔，民生疾苦，達於極點。社會秩序盪不安。</p>
<p>（一）農民生產</p>
<p>南滙縣的經濟是建築在農村中心的，她具有一百二十四萬畝的農田，和五十二萬的居民，照理全縣的食糧可以自給自足，不處恐慌。但現經記者的實地考察，則適與理想相反，蓋全縣米糙的出產，其數量僅足供全縣三月所需，不足之數，全賴由金山松江等處輸人。若來源一旦欠暢，恐慌立即發生。兼以鄰近滬地，市價以滬地爲轉移，一日數更，不足爲怪，因是農民日愁米價之高漲。至談所謂「穀賤傷農」者，此問情形實得其反。再談南滙的特產，棉花山芋花生也是農民的經濟來源，依此爲生。就棉花論，棉產的處理，目前極不自由，且現市價又賤，幾等於對折，（戰前籽棉一担可換白粳一石目前祗能換五斗）再加人工肥料之昂貴，捐稅水脚之繁重，運滬推銷，難免虧本。如此凋敝的農村，在過去尚賴本鄉旅滬經商的商人，與薪水階級不時滙欵返鄉，以資彌補，目前滬地生活高漲，除極少數的商人外，其餘一般旅滬的薪水階級，皆感受生活的壓迫，自顧不周，遑論滙欵來鄉。以是此間農村經濟日趨破敗，因農村金融枯竭，以致耕作資本籌措困難，農民需欵孔亟，不免作飲鳩止渴之舉，致造成高利貸乘機抬頭之機會。此間盛行之非法貼現，其利率之高，駭人聽聞，詳情容富另章中述。</p>
<p>（二）商人生涯</p>
<p>戰後上海的商人，可稱天生驕子，真是可謂「萬般皆下品，惟有商人高」。但這話在此間除極少數之長袖善舞的大腹巨賈外，而一般小商人資本缺少，進貨須求諸黑市，而黑市貨物的來源，係一般單帮客由滬販來，按例須照貨價付三成之手續費，致成本增高。外加商人應得之利潤，致售價高昂，兼以大衆購買力異常薄弱。經記者巡禮全城，祇見各商店門可羅雀，而店員等皆互相自我談天，態度至爲間暇，曾經連訪幾位老闆，莫不大歡苦經。據謂滬上百貨飛漲，店中進貨不易，目前造成全城，商店貨物日見減少，補進不易之趨勢。至本地土產出口，商人亦以沿途水脚捐稅繁重，兼以資本欠足之故，甚難發展。</p>
<p>（三）三員及地</p>
<p>此處所謂三員，乃指店員敎員公務員，與當地非法胡爲之地痞流氓而言·三員當中以店員生活較爲優裕，而尚安定，蓋店員除由店主供給膳宿外，較大商店，每至年終尚有一筆花紅可分。雖謂平日月薪金祇約千金，設無家累，個人生活，尚無問題。而最苦者，則爲似乎命裏注定，向與窮字結不解緣的敎育界。此間小學敎員束修月祇六百金，學米兩斗，（鄉鎮中尚不及此）如此待遇，伙食尚嫌不足，遑論其他。公務員生活與敎員幾同一命運，蓋薪金由兩千一百元至三千元，伙食自理，區區此數，何足維持，遑遑終日祇慮三餐之不足，工作效率自减。據謂曾有來自他鄉之公務員日處愁城，三餐不濟，臨行將最後所有之鋪蓋變賣，取得些微之代價，始能成行，亦云慘矣。故以記者私見，政府欲推行廉潔政治與提高行政效率，務須先從改善公務員之待遇說起。至於當地之地痞流氓，實令人痛心，因勢力雄厚，即地方官吏亦須假以辭色，遑論小民。故此間鄉鎮間，過事發生，即此　發財之機會，武斷鄉曲，對商家則强賒挨賣，使用遠期支票威迫掉現，此種事實層出不窮。</p>
<p>（四）南匯三害</p>
<p>烟賭與高利貸，爲南滙之三害。按烟賭値此非常時期各處盛行，南滙之癮君子據調查所得，幾及萬人，而白麵客，則超過此數三四倍，爲害之烈，可想而知，以一八兩區爲最，鄰近海浜地帶烟民更比比皆是。這般烟民類皆中產階級，一旦染有嗜好，不能自拔，終至傾家敗產，淪爲乞丐小竊，對鄉鎮社會秩序影響至大。賭風在南滙各地皆盛，其方式則多在茶寮中舉行，呼盧喝雉，通宵達旦，故雖窮鄉僻壤亦茶館林立，其營業大宗則聚眾作方城之戲，一局勝負之數，動輒二三十萬，而館主則按數抽頭，茶資向例免收。營業鼎盛者一夕可得百萬金，司空見慣，毫不足奇，賭風最盛者，首推八區之大團與七區之三灶，常有鄉民因所負過鉅，賣田不足以償，遂挺身走險，逃往遊擊區，此亦年來鄉間治安難以確立之主要原因之一。高利貸之抬頭，實與烟賭有連帶關係，而正當農民，商人亦每因周轉不靈，一時爲應付債務起見，不得已持遠期支票，乞靈於擁有現金，專營剝削貧民勾當的高利貸者之門，而利率最高達每千元日息十一元，其手段之辣，殊足驚人，恐即滬上專放皮球錢者亦望塵莫及。</p>
<p>（五）民眾的負擔</p>
<p>當記者初抵此間，行裝甫卸，曾往街頭巡體一番，就發覺一個小小的南滙縣城，　是機關林立，銜牌密佈，總計其數不下三十。試問如許機關，究竟平日所作何事，經考察之後，這多數爲病民的捐稅機關。茲將其捐稅種類分述如左：</p>
<p>（一）商民方面，一般性的，計有營業稅，所得稅，印花稅，消費特稅，統稅特稅，房捐等。專稅計有屠宰稅，烟酒牌照稅，竹木營業專稅，豬只稅，牙稅，漁業建設料等。</p>
<p>以上各項稅收，係由財政局招商承包，由承包者分包給小包商，輾轉承包，對上則出少數承包費，對下則橫徴暴歛，小民苦矣。實際上政府所得之稅款，僅佔全數百份之二三，餘皆實行中飽，莫怪此肇事前千方百計極力鎮營，務必到手而後已，事後皆搖身一變，而爲面團團之富翁矣。</p>
<p>（二）農民方面，農　每畝除田賦一百八十元，並帶徴軍警米一百五十元外，農民實際尚須供應地方隊伍之實物徴發，及遊擊隊之勒索，與其他之苛捐雜稅，不一而足，致使今日之農村中鷄犬不寗。記者每與此間老農談論農村情况，莫不搖首蹙頓，徒呼奈何。故記者以爲如談改善農村經濟問題，首先須做到廢除苛雜與確立治安兩點。</p>
<p>（三）臨時捐稅，是由地方自治機關臨時徴收，計有公益捐，棉被捐，供應費，制服費，鄉鎮公所經常費等名稱。以上各項捐款，係因地方預算不敷，藉此抵補。記者茲悉新任縣長陳一夢氏，曾宣稱南滙改縣以後，田賦收入歸縣方自行支配，今後對臨時攤派之苛雜，决予撇廢，此不　爲久困水火中民眾之福音，但陳氏之言行是否貫澈，吾人當拭目以待也。</p>

<h3>本報舉行　海戰祝捷廣播　袁履登魯風兩先生主講</h3>
<p>本報主辦之「台菲海戰祝捷廣播」，於昨日下午假座黃浦電台舉行，首由本報陳社長說明主辦祝捷廣播意義，編請市商會理事長袁履登，及新中國報主筆魯風演講，旋開始廣播節目，遊藝界諸君準時到台播唱，異常精彩，昨並由新聞聯合會總幹事任雲鵬担任報告。</p>
<p>（陳社長詞）</p>
<p>諸位聽眾：今天申報主辦台菲海戰祝捷廣播，聘請袁履登先生魯風先生演講，並承游藝界諸君參加廣播，非常感謝。</p>
<p>關於台灣菲律賓海戰，盟軍勝利的捷報，片片傳來，諸位諒已見到了。我們對於這次台菲海戰大挺，所以特別重視的，有兩點，第一，大東亞戰爭已達決戰階段，台菲戰役的勝利，將故美太平洋艦隊主力擊減，奠定了最後勝利的基礎。第二，大東亞戰爭是解放大東亞全體民族的戰爭，生死存亡，在此一戰，現在因台菲海戰勝利而奠定勝利基礎，就是大東亞民族解放獲得了保證。</p>
<p>因爲上述兩點的重要性，所以，我們特別促起大眾注意，一方面表示慶祝，一方面表示警覺，共同以更大的努力，完成大東亞戰爭最後勝利。</p>
<p>（袁履登詞）</p>
<p>今日爲中報主辦之台菲海戰祝捷廣播節目，乃是極有意義之節目，亦不僅爲一地一國所有意義之事，而爲整個大東亞休戚相關之問題。蓋是次盟邦日本在台灣菲律賓海面之獲得大勝，與大東亞共榮圈建設，已奠定其鞏固之基礎，此種意義在各報章上，業經闡明，諒諸位將此次勝利之意義，加以說明。我中國五千年以來以道義爲尚，所謂「道不可須臾離也，可離則非道也」，道者即爲道德，以道之立場而言，在戰爭中人人均應抱有犧牲精神，此種犧牲精神其目上爲何？則是爲創立大東亞共榮圈之基礎，爲何欲創立大東亞共榮圈之基礎，則爲完成大東亞各國民族榮耀之前途。故在今日，凡我大東亞民族俱應向此一貫政策努力，倘無此種努力與犧牲之精神，則道義意義欠缺，此種道之意義，包括前方與後方一致之方向，前方戰士犧牲生命物質，後方努力增產，節約物資，刻苦生活，協力前方作戰，此種精神，即根據道所出發一刻不可離，「可離非道也」。故現下各報均根據此點開揚此精神，均已有甚多之祥細說明，大東亞民族爲實現大東亞各國共榮圈之建立，應有此同一決心。中國素重道義，現下大東亞共榮圈之基礎，已奠定，到達目的不遠，故中國人民不應一離道之精神，應放棄一切認識上與意見上之分歧，合而爲道之一致目的，向道義精神之道途努力邁進，前方後方一體協力，發揮此種力量，則後代億萬子孫，得永垂不朽光榮。</p>
<p>嗣由魯風演講，講題爲「菲島勝利與中國前途」，闡明菲島海戰勝利以後，足以確保大東亞戰爭的最後勝利，也就是中國解放前途的曙光。</p>

<p>楊中一：今日中秋佳節，人月雙圓，鄙人深爲諸長老及苦痛中之老人祝壽康寗。</p>
<p>徐乾麟：我以爲安老運動，爲孔子「汎愛眾」精神之實現，而以世界大同爲歸宿。所以我們自己也應該標榜仁義精神，身體力行，爲青年壯年之模範。</p>
<p>吳在：鄙人從事敎育事業，垂五十年，深知中國社會之通病，在自私自利。故盼老年人與少年人通力合作，剷除此等不正當之心理。</p>
<p>王慧善：中敎道義會，最初即由我們幾個老人創辦，不爲名利，一心濟貧救老，夏令施診給藥，解除疾病苦厄。現在入會者日甚一日，希望能够普及全國，爲社會多做一些救濟事業，實所深盼。</p>
<p>姜丹書：人人皆要老，人人應敬老，今日敬人老，他人敬我老，自幼而少，自少而老，此爲人生之過程。老者在少壯時代，常有貢獻於社會及人類，受人之敬，誰曰不宜。所以孔子曰「老者安之」，所以安老運動，實在是人類道德之最高表現。</p>
<p>（二）安老團體現况</p>
<p>黃營頑：適承諸位發揮安老與敬老運動理論的根據，現本人代表南市安老院，就事實上闡述安老運動之實况。</p>
<p>黃營頑（代安老院）：南市安老院，爲天主敎徒所辦，有四十多年之歷史，現有男女老人三百多人，年紀最高者爲九十多歲之某老太太。每月經費至少五十萬，募款侍應等事務，概由富於宗敎熱忱之修女卅餘人担任。本天主博愛仁慈的精神，以畢身精力，貢獻於安老事業，視貧苦老人，如同本生父母。凡縫紉·沐浴·洗灌·烹調等雜務，均由「姆姆」担任，有病者亦由「姆姆」服侍，這種「不憚煩」的精神，真值得敬佩，現在請保安養老堂代表，報告該堂槪况。</p>
<p>吳藩蓀：保安養老堂在北成都路，有七年歷史，收容六十至七十歲之老人四十多人。因經費關係，只能每日兩餐，一粥一飯，閒時以唸經爲消遣，以摺箔爲生產，所得報酬，作爲零用。</p>
<p>丁福保：日食兩餐，其實是很合衛生的，尤其老人，再適當沒有了，而老人消遣，最好敎以靜坐法，其清閒妙趣，實較當貴人家之老人爲高，而且很合長壽方法。</p>
<p>王國樑：本堂（殘廢養老堂），創辦於民國廿八年，專收戰區殘廢難民，及無靠老人，當時有一百五十多人，現因經費欠缺，及食米採購困難，僅容七十多人，老人佔全數四分之一。過去殘廢者及老人以簡易手工及籐工等工作，作爲消遣及生產，現在除飲食之外，以唸經消磨時光。</p>
<p>陸隱耕：本堂（新普育堂）在南市國貨路，於民國元年設立，有三十餘年歷史，佔地八十多畝，房屋五百餘間，戰前收容人數達三千五百，現僅九百餘人，內約有一百五十餘老人，各部事務，由姆姆拒任，日食二餐，一粥一飯。</p>
<p>黃營頑：上海的安老事業，不論在數量上，素質上，都比不上外國，現在請趙希明老老就平日視察心得，作綜合報道。</p>
<p>趙希明：上海安老團體，計有十二所：（一）慈善團體所辦者五所，如慈聯會，保安堂，殘廢院等是，中有住舍低濕，男女並處的不便，有改善之必要。（二）基督敎所辦者五所，共計三十五名，生活太難，維持不易，情殊堪慮。（三）天主敎所辦者二所，範圍最大，成績也最好，頗多可以效法參考之處。以上三種，各有利弊，尤其各宗敎團體，本上天憫人之德，推行安老運動，精神殊堪敬佩。由於以上之觀察，特提出下列三點建議：（一）慈善團體所辦者五所，如慈聯會，保安堂，殘廢院等是，中有住舍低濕，男女並處的不便，有改善之必要。（二）基督敎所辦者五所，共計三十五名，生活太難，維持不易，情殊堪處。（三）天主敎所辦者二所，範圍最大，成績也最好，頗多可以效法參考之處。以上三種，各有利弊，尤其各宗敎團體，本上天憫人之德，推行安老運動，精神殊堪敬佩。由於以上之觀察，特提出下列三點建議：（一）希望慈善團之五院統一，而分爲男女殘廢三所，然後力量才可集中，而管理也可便利。（二）希望基督敎之五所合而爲一，並延救世軍管理，擴大範圍。（三）希望天主敎二處，亦分男女殘廢，並多多灌輸宗敎觀念。此外還有一點，值得特別提出的，就是七浦路一所養老堂，因經濟拮据，已頻解散危境，眼看數十無家可歸的老人，將被迫門外流落街頭，轉乎溝壑，在這幅逼真的流民圖前，敢特別呼籲，祈請社會假以援手．</p>
<p>黃警頑：適承趙希老發抒情論，現請朱志堯老老發表。</p>
<p>朱志堯：年青人敬老安老，造成一時風氣，固爲社會之幸事，然而老人本身，郤不能倚老賣老，年紀雖老，心不可老，求人不如求已，所以老人應上崇天命，下勤已力，從事生產事業，養成自尊之人格，而後分餘力，賙濟疾苦，庶可爲老人模範。（未完）</p>

<h3>改善舊法租界　水電供應之芻議</h3>
<p>— 何堪</p>
<p>當法人擁有統治權於上海時，其蘆政方針，不外巧取豪奪，搜括中國人之資財，以供彼輩者豪之浪費，及匯還祖國，以供其政府之揮霍而已。其警務施策，尤爲此方針最明著之事之。中國人無時無地，不受彼輩之盤芻壓榨與侮辱。過有兩造相爭，不能自直扭至捕房時，彼法警及其僱用爲鷹犬之華員，除隨意股辱外，租予兩造以罰鍍處分。蓋彼等之目的，在於逞威福，括財物而已。中國人之是非曲直，非所措意也。滬事發生後，保甲制度應時而起，自警之制隨之而成，法警員更假借名義，增加捐稅及罰銀，戶口證發給時，即有封套之强售，每戶八元。市民證頒行時，又有封套之强售，每套二元。人民忘帶市民證，被查出時每次罰十元。自警遲到早退等罰鍍，更名目繁多，不能盡記。自陳市長接收法租界後，即三令五申，不准警員隨意處罰民衆，此風始職。然而法當局所獲不法之利，已不可勝計矣。今租界雖已收回，而電燈電車公司猶操之法國商人之手，實爲吾國最大之失策。彼失之於政治之搜括者，乃所償於該公司之搜括，其方式甚多。如；</p>
<p>（一）電表押鍍金之屢增也；－當中儲券改用之初，該公司藉口幣制更換，即着用戶改付較原額約一一十餘倍之押金，日來又復增加其數額，竟等於第一决增加後之二十倍强。例如原押金爲三元，第一次增至六十元，第二次增至千四百元，此後物價不免屢增，則此種押金不知將增至何種程度，市民所受威脅，良非淺鮮。</p>
<p>（二）水電及電車價之屢增也，－水電電車加價，已屢經以命令式强迫人民履行，直接刺激物價，增加人民負擔；而間接則貶低法幣價值，破壞政府維持法幣管理物價之努力與苦心，水電加價，每隔一二月輙爲一次，是否經市政當局之正式允許，無從而知。而日前電車未經我政府許可，竟敢自行加價一倍半，雖經當局正吿亦置若罔聞，至七日之久後一，雖恢復原價，而其不法浮收已等於該公司七日半收入之全部，米曾發還民衆，其藉一視我官民，至於此極，是可忍，孰不可忍</p>
<p>（三）利用節的水電之口號，以濫施罰則也。水電因煤斤缺乏，當局制止民衆浪費，故永電用量一減再減，並有罰則，以懲過量使用者，而該局利用此機，大事敲詐，將限度隨時隨意減低，有時登一小廣吿於報章即作爲公布減低限度之憑證，其實居民多有不識字者，或未及閱覽者，遂不知又在減低限度，遵限使用，以爲可免罰金，而一月旣終，罰條隨至，少則數百元，多則數千元，際此生活困苦之秋，每月用度本已左支右紬，忽有大量罰金突如其來，實出居民意料與預算之外。吾民在百孔千瘡之餘，何以堪此。謂新聞報十月三十日社會服務欄屠君質法商水電公司一文，即知該公司有意矇騙用戶，雖至公司詢問，亦不肯以新限度相告，而一紙罰金通知，突然送到，實乃該公司運用舊時警員壓追人民之故智，專以欺詐剝削爲能事，其用心之鄙劣，險很，實不可問。夫水電公司乃人民團體之一，不知何人授以處罰用戶之權柄，此種罰欵作何用途，亦非五口人所得知。以該公司此種故入人罪，强奪人財之手段，則每月罰款數之，無慮千萬金，　非吾民之脂膏，將盡爲貪鄙法人所剝削。綜上三項觀之，法商水電公司之劣跡昭彰已久，凡住居舊法租界者咸遭茶毒，我政府旣具解放人民於歐洲帝國主義魔手之決心，則去惡務盡，寗可姑息養奸，任此擊變本加厲，欺凌剝削耶</p>
<p>預意以爲根本辦法，當以收回自辦爲最妥：</p>
<p>（一）由市政府備款收回，歸公用機關經辦。</p>
<p>（二）由市民集資收回，作爲股份有限公司經營之，市民受該公司之盤削，創巨痛深，倘由政府妥加導領，籌集款項諒非難事。又該公司雖稱爲法商，常其設立之初，未必無攘用市政收入之事，此當加以澈底查究，如獲證據，則可無須贖款，應由法人無條件歸還。至於該公司服務之法人，除少數巨頭撤換外，其餘在戰事未終了之前，可暫加收容，或轉任他職，使其生活不至失所，以示我政府寬大之德意。</p>
<p>至於治標方面，亦屬重要，蓋收回須稽時日，而在未收回之頃，不可不改善該公司不良之惡習，茲擬辦法如下：</p>
<p>（一）每次水電新限度及新調整之價目，常明白刋載於前一月之帳單上適當處所，庶用戶得早加防，以免受罰。</p>
<p>（二）倘因永電管線破損，喪失水電，致越限度，非用戶之過失，則公司不得處罰。</p>
<p>（三）不得以款項爲罰則，最好以本月超越之數量由次月扣折，例如限度爲十五度，本月超越限度二度，則下月只准用十三度，倘不遵行者，第一二次予以嚴重警告，第三次則予以罰鍍。蓋水電加限，乃不准浪費之好意，並非有心剝削民財，而該公司假公濟私，專以巧取豪奪，加害用戶，非當局之本意也明矣。</p>
<p>（四）倘用戶有特殊原因，須多用水電，可向公司商量，准予移用，於後來數月中攤還。</p>
<p>（五）以前受罰之用戶，旣因該公司手續不當，及以前辦法不良之故，當許用戶攤還過量之度數後，發還所取之罰金。</p>
<p>（六）罰金不宜由公司享用，當交市府定爲市民其種福利之用。</p>
<p>（七）除新　外，水電表一押櫃不准增加，例如從前所繳押櫃實等於該表之一半價值，第一次增加已超越該表實價，是該表已屬於用戶，何可藉物價上脫，增加押櫃。以上七條治標辦法，鄙意認爲極好一公允。蓋用戶與公司本非仇警，公司之生存，更須倚賴用戶，爲公司計亦不應專事與用戶爲難，激成惡感。際此生活艱難之際，雖有少數暴發戶手頭充裕，而一般民衆皆苦不堪言，該公司不能以優越地位欺凌用戶，以增加其痛苦也。顧賢明之當局，速與該公司爲談判，先實行治標辦法，以安民心，再從長商討收回方法，倘該公司執迷不悟，定居奇不肯就範，當局富强制收回，或科以至重之敷設稅，使其不能營業而後已，主權在我，豈容放棄。</p>

<h3>Meat Grinding Assault on Enemy Fleet off Peleliu's Eastern Waters: Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces Results of Torpedo Suicide Squad</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 1st: On the morning of October 28th, the Japanese Torpedo Suicide Squad launched a meat-grinding assault on an enemy transport fleet off the eastern waters of Peleliu Island, sinking four ships and destroying two. Simultaneously, a meat-grinding assault team that had penetrated the northern shore of the island successfully launched a surprise landing.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese forces in the Central Pacific, in response to the valiant fight of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps, are continuing their brave struggle. In the Peleliu Island area of the Palau Islands, since the enemy landed on September 15th, they have been engaging in operations day and night with torpedo suicide squads and meat-grinding assault teams, fully demonstrating the unique and strong spirit of the Japanese army, making the enemy tremble. The Japanese army and navy units in Palau Island are also providing all possible assistance to the Japanese forces fighting hard on Peleliu Island. On the other hand, the enemy is also exerting all its strength to supply Peleliu Island in response to the operations in the Philippines. On the 27th, they launched a desperate landing operation on the eastern shore of the island with approximately 18 transport ships (including 10 large transport ships). After detecting this movement of the enemy forces, the Japanese naval forces on Palau Island immediately launched an attack on the 28th with torpedo suicide squads and meat-grinding teams to support the Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps. Among them, the torpedo suicide squad achieved a great victory in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island, sinking four enemy transport ships and destroying two enemy transport ships. The meat-grinding team launched a surprise landing on the northern shore of Peleliu Island, which has already succeeded, and is currently still engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Central News Agency News - The Japanese torpedo squadron sank an enemy American transport fleet supplying landing troops in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese military headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on November 1st that the Japanese torpedo suicide squad launched a surprise attack on the enemy American transport fleet in the eastern waters of Peleliu Island on the morning of October 28th, achieving a great victory of sinking four and destroying four. In addition, the assault team led by Lieutenant Commander Taniji Endo of the Navy, in response, penetrated the northern shore of Peleliu Island by boat, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. This surprise attack operation is extremely important from the perspective of the overall war situation. (1) Cutting off the enemy's food supply line in Leyte Gulf, isolating the forces of MacArthur, and further expressing the determination to launch a general counterattack on the Pacific islands already in enemy hands. By using Peleliu Island to block enemy target areas such as the Philippine Islands and Borneo, this narrow and isolated island of 30 square kilometers has become the site of a bloody battle for 20,000 people, which is a unique tactic of Japanese soldiers. This surprise attack resulted in the complete annihilation of three enemy divisions reinforced from Angaur Island. (2) The torpedo suicide squad in the sea is like the Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps in the air, a concrete manifestation of the Japanese people's heroic spirit of defending their country, which is enough to make the enemy tremble. The enemy's transport fleet is a temporary conversion of merchant ships, and their aircraft carriers are assembled in a crude manner. Therefore, by using these torpedoes and bombs, which represent the Japanese national spirit, to launch heroic attacks unprecedented in history, no enemy ship can escape, and the United Kingdom and the United States will be stunned.</p>
<h3>Japanese Kamikaze Attack Air Corps Demonstrates Bushido Spirit: Details of Heroic Operations in the Eastern Philippines</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - As a major decisive battle between Japan and the United States unfolds in the Philippines, the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and other new elite air corps are thoroughly demonstrating their Bushido spirit, launching fierce attacks day after day on the enemy mobile units and their transport fleets in the eastern waters of the Philippines and Leyte Gulf, inflicting enormous blows on the persistently stubborn enemy. The results achieved to date were announced by the Imperial Japanese Headquarters on the 31st. The details of the battles of each corps are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>25th (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and the Shikishima Corps, at noon, used ramming tactics in the east of the Surigao Strait, sinking one enemy giant aircraft carrier with two aircraft, destroying one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier with one aircraft, and ramming and sinking one enemy cruiser with one aircraft. (2) Another Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps, in the morning, in the waters east of Surigao, besieged an enemy mobile unit possessing aircraft carriers, overcame the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, and hit and destroyed an enemy standard aircraft carrier. In addition, a part of another attack corps also dispatched to destroy the enemy. Since all of them have not returned, it is difficult to determine the results of the battle, but it is thought that the gains will not be small.</p>
<p>26th - The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps, at half past noon, in the waters east of Surigao, besieged an enemy mobile unit possessing four aircraft carriers, overcame the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, giant fighters (approximately 60 aircraft), and intense anti-aircraft fire, launching a sure-hit attack. Two aircraft hit one enemy large aircraft carrier, engulfing the entire hull in fierce explosions. Japanese escort aircraft confirmed that it sank. Another aircraft hit the deck next to the bridge of an enemy aircraft carrier, causing it to tilt at approximately 40 degrees. Japanese escort aircraft then saw it restored.</p>
<p>27th (1) The Kamikaze Special Attack Air Corps and the Junchu Corps, at approximately 7:00 PM, penetrated the Leyte Gulf area, bombing enemy ships at anchor. Due to the darkness, it was difficult to distinguish the type of enemy ships. Commander So-and-so, a captain, intended to attack the enemy ships, but due to the obstruction of enemy fighters, he was unable to contact his wingmen. As a result, the commander's aircraft and a part of the direct escort aircraft had no choice but to return to base. The second and third aircraft, which lost contact, launched ramming attacks. One aircraft hit an enemy transport ship, causing it to immediately catch fire, explode, and sink. Unfortunately, the results of the other aircraft have not yet been determined. (2) The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps assault team, in coordination with escort aircraft, attacked the enemy fleet anchored in Leyte Gulf at approximately 6:00 PM. One aircraft first hit the stern of an enemy battleship, destroying it. The second aircraft hit a cruiser, also destroying it. The third aircraft was hit by enemy fire during the attack, resulting in it hitting the stern of an enemy large transport ship. That evening, it penetrated Leyte Gulf. Due to the difficulty of confirmation, it returned to base together with the escort aircraft.</p>
<p>28th - The commander of the Junchu Corps departed from base alone at approximately 4:00 AM, launching a brave attack on enemy ships in Leyte Gulf. Because it was not coordinated with escort aircraft, it was impossible to confirm the results of the battle.</p>
<p>29th - In the sea a certain distance east of Ormoc Bay, an enemy fleet was discovered, composed of four aircraft carriers (including three large aircraft carriers), two to four battleships, and other cruisers and destroyers, totaling more than 20 ships. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps immediately dispatched to launch a fierce attack. One aircraft hit the vicinity of the bridge of one enemy aircraft carrier, causing an immediate explosion. Another ship of unknown type and one cruiser were also hit and caught fire. Due to the obstruction of enemy escort aircraft, it was not possible to confirm the hits.</p>
<p>30th Morning - The Kamikaze Special Attack Corps received intelligence that an enemy mobile unit had been discovered in the southeast sea area of Suluan Island, attempting to invade Leyte Gulf. The enemy mobile unit was formed with two giant aircraft carriers, one medium-sized aircraft carrier, one battleship, and many other ships. The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps rushed from a certain base and launched a fierce attack. Three of them hit one enemy large aircraft carrier, causing it to catch fire and immediately sink. One of them hit one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier, causing it to catch fire. Another one hit one enemy small aircraft carrier. Other circumstances could not be confirmed due to the dense smoke and fire from the large aircraft carrier. Another one hit the stern of an enemy battleship, also injuring it.</p>
<h3>Director Endo Talks About How the Kamikaze Corps Has Grasped V-1 Control Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Lieutenant General Endo, Director of the Aeronautical Weapons General Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, recently gave a speech, the gist of which was that after the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps launched its attacks, the enemy Americans were terrified. Currently, Germany's V-1 flying bomb attacks on the United Kingdom cannot transform the elements of the war situation. The disadvantage is the lack of control power. Therefore, our side, learning from the lessons of allied nations, must create a V-1 with control power. He also commented that although the V-1 has great power, it generally lacks a clear target and must have accurate control power, but it is feared that no country can make this control power a reality. However, this time, the Japanese Special Attack Corps has completely succeeded in making it a reality. Japan's V-1 has now fully exerted its power. In the future, even more weapons that will terrify the American army will continue to appear.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base in the Philippines, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a report from the Japanese air corps at noon on October 31st, patrolling the Leyte Gulf area, there are enemy cruisers and a dozen destroyers (including several battleships) anchored in that area, confirming that most of the approximately 60 enemy transport ships have tilted and sunk due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Corps and the Japanese air corps.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Social Welfare and the Issue of Elderly Care</h3>
<p>In recent discussions of social welfare, the most easily overlooked aspect is perhaps elderly care. This is because a common misconception prevails, viewing respect and care for the elderly merely as an old-fashioned notion or a passive form of charity. While efforts in this regard are appreciated, their absence is deemed inconsequential to society's future. In reality, this viewpoint is a root cause of today's deteriorating public morals and societal unrest. It is important to understand that respect and care for the elderly were the highest principles of our ancient morality. The "Great Way" of governance sought to realize the ideal of "not only cherishing one's own relatives," leading to the saying "cherish the elderly of others as you cherish your own" and "the elderly shall be cared for." Successive governments have promoted respect for the elderly and enacted policies for their care. Society at large also fostered a spirit of reverence for the elderly, still often seen in the towns and villages of the mainland, preserving noble and pure customs. However, upon reaching the treaty ports and major cities, the notion of respecting and caring for the elderly is often dismissed as impractical, leading people to pursue only self-interest and power, resulting in moral decay and societal decline. This is a pressing social problem.</p>
<p>Recognizing this, our newspaper, following the symposium on child welfare, convened a "Symposium on Elderly Care." The aim was to bring together representatives from elderly care organizations and respected philanthropists in the city to share their insights, consolidate opinions, and improve and promote elderly care initiatives. At the same time, we hope to raise awareness of the issue of elderly care among all sectors of society. We believe that the benefits will extend beyond the lonely and helpless elderly, having a significant impact on the hearts and minds of the people and on society as a whole.</p>
<p>How to ensure that "the elderly have a secure life" is a matter addressed by governments in many countries, with dedicated policies, funding, and organizations. Simultaneously, there are various well-organized and large-scale elderly care initiatives in society. Our country lags far behind in all aspects and naturally cannot be compared. However, there has never been a shortage of dedicated individuals in society striving for this cause, especially the efforts of the religious community, which are most commendable. Taking this city as an example, institutions such as the elderly homes and the New General Welfare Hall's elderly ward, are undoubtedly worthy of praise in terms of scale, organization, and care, as anyone who has visited them can attest. However, overall, there are only about twelve elderly care organizations in the city. Apart from the two run by Catholic teachers, the number of elderly people they accommodate has been gradually decreasing, primarily due to rising prices and increasing expenses, making it difficult to sustain operations. Even for the two institutions run by the Catholic Church, although the elderly home still houses over 300 people, it is questionable how long they can sustain this given the current economic situation. As for the New General Welfare Hall, which previously accommodated over 3,000 elderly, young, and disabled individuals in distress, with a considerable number of men, women, elderly, and disabled among them, only about 150 people remain in the hall. The five institutions run by Christian churches and the five run by charitable organizations face even more difficult circumstances, and the living conditions of the elderly they accommodate cannot be compared to those of the elderly homes. If those who are being accommodated and assisted are facing such a situation, how many more elderly, sick, lonely, and widowed individuals are not being accommodated or assisted! We only need to pay a little attention to those crying in the streets and alleys, even starving to death by the roadside; they are everywhere. Who has no parents, how can we bear to see them wandering? We cannot help but call on the relevant authorities, especially well-informed and compassionate individuals from all walks of life, to jointly find ways to provide assistance.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of assisting lonely and impoverished elderly, specific and practical conclusions were reached at this symposium on elderly care. (Please refer to the records of the symposium on elderly care on page 3 of today's newspaper). We believe there are some points that deserve special attention from the relevant authorities and community leaders, as follows:</p>
<p>First, regarding the improvement and maintenance of existing elderly care organizations, Mr. Zhao Ximing's three proposals at the symposium are very relevant to the facts. We hope that the leaders of each organization can put aside prejudices and pay special attention to them. However, it seems that the third point, addressed to the two institutions run by the Catholic Church, has already been implemented. We hope that other organizations will visit them more often, adopt the methods used by the nuns and sisters, and especially learn from their spirit of sacrifice and service. But we more eagerly hope that all sectors of society will do their best to assist existing organizations, so that they can maintain and improve, and further expand the number of people they can accommodate.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the improvement of the general elderly population's living conditions, this symposium on elderly care raised issues such as nutrition, treatment, production, and rest. Elders Zhu, Ding, and Xu shared their insightful views. We hope that all elders, regardless of wealth or gender, will pay special attention to them. Even those who are children can refer to them as basic principles for serving their parents and elders.</p>
<p>Third, in order to universally respect and care for the elderly, to change the social atmosphere, we still rely on the government authorities and leaders from all walks of life to vigorously promote this cause. Implementing measures such as seniority-based salary increases and preferential retirement benefits for government agencies, schools, public and private organizations, as well as factory service personnel. Society, especially medical, transportation agencies, and entertainment venues, should have specific preferential measures for the elderly, creating an environment of respect and care. We firmly believe that these measures have a significant impact on the future revival of society.</p>

<h3>The Philippine Front: Consolidated Results of the Japanese Army Air Corps: Sinking and Destroying a Large Number of Enemy Ships</h3>
<p>Manila, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the U.S. military landed in Leyte Gulf, fierce battles have been unfolding day after day. By the 30th, the consolidated results of the Japanese Army Air Corps alone were: sinking one cruiser, ten cruisers or large destroyers, one destroyer, six transport ships, and fifteen landing craft. Destroying one aircraft carrier, three battleships, three battleships or cruisers, one cruiser, ten destroyers, twelve transport ships, several landing craft, and many ships of unknown type. 44 transport ships, several landing craft, and one ship of unknown type were hit and caught fire. 11 enemy aircraft were confirmed shot down or destroyed, 10 were unconfirmed, 77 were destroyed (including those on the ground), 9 places at the landing site caught fire, 25 airport facilities caught fire, and 2 searchlight positions and 2 anti-aircraft gun positions were destroyed.</p>
<p>Manila, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Although the enemy forces have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese air corps, they are stubbornly advancing at the landing site on Leyte Island. According to the report of the Japanese reconnaissance team on the morning of the 29th, ten P-38 aircraft were seen at Tacloban Airport, and one aircraft was on aerial patrol. It was also learned that a part of the air corps was stationed in Biak Island, and vehicles for building a base were placed at Sambaburo Airport, and they are currently engaged in maintenance.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account by Ensign Hayano</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the great naval battle in the eastern Philippines the other day, Ensign Hayano of the Japanese Army Air Corps recounted as follows: "At that time, the sky above was cloudy, and it was a pity that the view below was not very clear. On that day, I and others set out to scout the enemy landing site in Leyte Gulf. During the voyage, we saw black dots on the course in the distance, which were our fleet. The aircraft carrier was majestic, and there were escort fighters protecting the fleet. The vanguard of our air force was the preemptive strike team. My attitude was also serious, and I silently prayed for the victory of our fleet. At that time, the enemy air corps flying from the distant sky had already launched a decisive battle with our air force over the Pacific Ocean. The enemy aircraft that were shot down trailed black smoke, spiraled down, and crashed. Our army's giant cannonballs exploded continuously in the air. Enemy torpedo planes were engulfed in flames and crashed into the sea. I was flying in the clouds, and in the gaps of the broken clouds, I saw our army's accurate giant cannons roaring. The enemy fleet was also clearly visible below. Some enemy aircraft carriers were tilted, and some were sinking. In an instant, several enemy cruisers were blown up. The enemy was terrified of our army's attack, and fired anti-aircraft shells to protect their aircraft carrier. At that time, the enemy fighters flying in the sky had already been defeated by our air force. Their aircraft carrier was tilted, and other ships were gradually destroyed and sunk into the sea, eventually perishing. I braved the violent air currents and continued reconnaissance in the sky, and seeing the great results of this battle in the swaying motion, my joy and emotion were difficult to contain."</p>
<h3>One Enemy Aircraft Reconnoiters Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - At approximately 1:00 PM on the 1st, one enemy B-29 aircraft, which took off from a base near the Mariana Islands, intruded into the airspace over Tokyo. At approximately 1:30 PM, it fled to the southeast. The enemy aircraft did not drop bombs. The enemy's operations in the Philippines have suffered enormous losses due to the fierce counterattacks of the Japanese army, navy, and air force, and their operational progress has not been as desired. It is believed that the enemy aircraft's intrusion into Tokyo this time was to contain the Japanese counterattack. In addition, the U.S. presidential election will be held on the 7th, and this matter has a strategic intention and was for reconnaissance purposes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Night Raid on Fenny Airfield</h3>
<p>Frontline Base in Burma, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Japanese aircraft in Burma attacked the enemy airfield in Fenny, eastern Bengal, again on the night of the 29th. In this operation, two enemy aircraft parked on the ground were hit and caught fire, and other facilities were also severely damaged. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<h3>Truth About Stillwell's Recall: Discord Between Chongqing and Yan'an Disappoints the U.S.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Regarding the resignation of U.S. General Stilwell, commander of the U.S. forces stationed in Chongqing, the U.S. government revealed the details of the matter on the 31st through the United Press and the Associated Press. According to the United Press, New Delhi, the reason for Stilwell's return to the country was only announced now, but it originated as far back as two months ago, when General Hurley and Nelson arrived in Chongqing. In order to make a rapid counteroffensive in East Asia, the U.S. command gave the two men the greatest authority, asking Chongqing to cooperate with the U.S. military in order to enhance the war effort against Japan. According to reliable information from the United Press, the U.S. government has in fact used the suspension of aid to Chongqing as a means of intimidation. At the same time, in order to avoid misunderstandings and provide accurate reports, the U.S. government has finally softened its attitude, maintaining the dignity of Chongqing and adopting a policy of appeasement. It is generally expected that the recall of Stilwell is the U.S.'s attempt to require cooperation between the KMT and the CCP, so that the two armies can cooperate in resisting Japan. Hurley and Nelson have stated that the failure of Chongqing and Yan'an to reconcile has disappointed the U.S. government.</p>
<p>What the U.S. government requires is (1) to reorganize the KMT government in Chongqing and remove xenophobic elements, and (2) to appoint U.S. military officers as commanders not only on the Burmese front but also in important battles on other fronts. These forceful conditions were presented to Chongqing. At the same time, Roosevelt also sent a personal letter to Chiang Kai-shek. During the negotiations, Chiang indirectly admitted that it would be impossible to transfer a part of the Chongqing army commanders on the important central China front. Although other conditions have been agreed to, the dissolution or reorganization of the KMT government has been rejected. According to a recent report by White, the Associated Press correspondent in Chongqing, Stilwell's return to the country is a manifestation of the division of opinions between the U.S. military commander in East Asia and Chiang. The many disputes caused by Stilwell's return to the country show that Roosevelt will entrust Chiang Kai-shek with the responsibility of reorganizing Chongqing and strengthening its war effort. When Stilwell returned to the country, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss also submitted his resignation. Gauss has always advocated a tough attitude towards Chongqing. He believes that Stilwell's return to the country is the demise of the U.S.'s position in Chongqing.</p>
<p>Conflict Between Stilwell and Chiang</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt told reporters on the 31st that the recall of Stilwell was not a political issue. Stilwell had indeed achieved great results in his responsibility, but his conflict with Chiang Kai-shek was a failure.</p>
<p>New U.S. Commander Arrives in New Delhi</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Chongqing dispatch, Lieutenant General Sultan, the U.S. Deputy Commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, who has been transferred to the Indian-Burmese front, has been appointed as the commander of the U.S. forces stationed in India and Chongqing. It is also reported that Sultan arrived in New Delhi on October 31st.</p>

<h3>Japanese Elite Troops in Guangxi Province Repeatedly Occupy Key Points, Capture Lingchuan and Directly Threaten Pingle and Yangshuo</h3>
<p>Guangxi Front, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: After capturing Lingtian Street, Japanese elite troops continued their advance, reaching the eastern highlands overlooking the Guilin plain on the morning of the 29th. On the 30th, fierce fighting broke out with Chongqing troops east of Guilin. Another unit of Japanese troops approached within four kilometers east of Lingchuan on the 29th, overcoming the Chongqing troops' reliance on several high and deep fortifications with persistent resistance from mortars and heavy artillery. They occupied Lingchuan day and night and continued to pursue the Chongqing troops. One direction of the Japanese army attacking Guilin Airport, on the morning of the 29th at 10 o'clock, broke into Dawei, a key point on the Guilin-Yangshuo highway (15 kilometers southeast of Guilin), posing a major threat to the rear communication line of the Guilin direct defense forces and the Chongqing 37th Group Army entrenched in Pingle and Yangshuo.</p>
<p>Guilin Suburbs: Two Armies in Combat</p>
<p>Hengyang, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: According to a dispatch from a reporter of the Japanese army reporting team in the suburbs of Guilin, a certain unit of the Japanese army in Guangxi had advanced to the Chongqing army positions on the northeastern outskirts of Guilin on the night of the 30th, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Since the Japanese army advanced into Guangxi Province in early October, they have successively captured Quanxian, Xing'an, and other key points on the Xiang-Gui Railway, and continued to advance towards Guilin. By dusk on the 29th of last month, they had defeated two divisions of the Chongqing 93rd Army, occupied Lingchuan, the forward stronghold of Guilin, and advanced another 60 li on the 30th, reaching the north of Guilin Xinshi Street at 10:25 p.m. on the same day. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the 31st Army, 2nd Division, under the command of Wei Yunsong, commander of the Chongqing 60th Group Army. Other Japanese army units also advanced towards the Xiangfeng Mountain, the southern position outside Guilin city, on the 30th.</p>
<p>Guangxi, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: After breaking into Lingtian Street on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese army continued its rapid advance. The Chongqing troops stubbornly defended Yang'anqi (8 kilometers northeast of Guilin) to Dushan (10 kilometers northeast of Yang'anqi). In this battle, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack and defeated them on the 30th.</p>
<p>Occupation of Fuchuan, Chongqing Troops Retreat</p>
<p>Guangxi Front, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: The Japanese army previously attacked in the direction of Yongming, and at dusk on the 26th, they defeated 300 Chongqing troops near Shenjie. On the 27th, they repelled another regiment or so of Chongqing troops and occupied Fuchuan (a key point on the Maojiang River). The Chongqing troops around the area have retreated towards the ancient city wall.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing Air Force Base</p>
<p>Chinese Base, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: On the night of the 30th, a Japanese bomber squadron braved the adverse weather and attacked Liuzhou, a Chongqing military counter-offensive base. They overcame intense anti-aircraft fire and repeatedly bombed the air force base and warehouses, causing fires in various places. However, due to the absolute darkness, the details of the battle results could not be determined.</p>
<p>South China Front Base, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: According to news arriving locally, dozens of American naval fighter planes have flown to the Nanning and Liuzhou airfields in recent days. This is because most of the American naval vessels were sunk or destroyed in the past naval battles in Taiwan and the Philippines, and these naval fighter planes were unable to fly back to their mother ships and had to fly here. However, only a few dozen of these returned American aircraft were seen. From this, it can be inferred that the rest have suffered the same fate as the naval vessels, so the losses suffered by the American military this time are indeed quite significant.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Attacks Chongqing Army, Battle Results</p>
<p>South China Front Line, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in Guangxi, which is attacking on the left bank of the Xijiang River, recently constructed positions in the hilly area between Xinxu, 30 kilometers north of Guiping, and Sanjiangxu, 15 kilometers west of the same place. On the morning of the 28th, they began a frontal attack on about 2,000 troops of the independent 2nd regiment directly under the Chongqing Fourth War Area. Other powerful units outflanked the rear of the Chongqing army, blocking their retreat. The two units echoed each other and launched a fierce attack. According to reports, the Chongqing army on the front was Zhang Fakui's troops, equipped with excellent equipment such as mountain guns, mortars, and machine guns, and had American officers instructing them. The main results of the Japanese army by the 30th were as follows: About 200 Chongqing army corpses were abandoned (including staff officers and battalion commanders, etc.). The Japanese army seized the following weapons: 2 heavy mountain guns, 1 mortar, 6 machine guns, 6 heavy machine guns, 9 light machine guns, and many other weapons.</p>
<h3>Zhijiang and Laohekou Airfields Attacked by Air</h3>

<h3>Soviet Offensive Repulsed on East Prussian Border, German New Weapons Display Power</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: Reuter's report: A German military spokesperson pointed out: The Soviet and Anglo-American forces also believe that the German Tiger King tank has superior combat power, and Germany also has the latest type of landmine, which cannot be found even with magnetic search. Germany has various new weapons, which is the reason why the Soviet army's offensive in East Prussia has been frustrated. The Soviet army sent a large force of 35 divisions to attack East Prussia, but in fact, its combat power has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st Dispatch, Central News Agency: Reuter's report: German military authorities have counted the Soviet army's losses in East Prussia in 12 days, which shows that the German army has achieved a defensive victory, even though the narrow land on the border has fallen into the hands of the Soviet army. Fierce battles are still raging along the coast of Courland, from East to Riba, and West to Ositz. The Soviet authorities apparently want to eliminate the threat to their flanks before launching another attack on East Prussia.</p>
<p>Advance Along the Danube River to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The second focal point on the Eastern Front is the Buszta plain in Hungary. The Soviet army's move to push north to the Slovak border has stalled due to heavy losses in the battles of Tebresen, Niregyhaza, and Mezodul. The Soviet advance from the Carpathian Mountains has also been blocked to the east of Beskid. Between the Danube and Tisza rivers, the Soviet army is beginning its offensive towards Budapest.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>A Perspective on Nanhui Society</h3>
<p>— Yifei</p>
<p>In my previous correspondence, I briefly reported on the general situation of Nanhui. Now, I will further describe the various aspects of Nanhui society as follows:</p>
<p>Nanhui County is one of the larger counties under the jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipality and is also designated as a model county by the Ministry of Interior. From the outside, it has a vast area, a considerable population, and abundant products. But if you look at its inner layer, you will immediately find its internal morbidity, riddled with holes, and the people's livelihood is extremely difficult. Social order is unstable.</p>
<p>(1) Farmers' Production</p>
<p>Nanhui County's economy is built on the rural center. It has 1.24 million mu of farmland and 520,000 residents. In theory, the county's food supply can be self-sufficient and not panic. However, the reporter's on-the-spot investigation shows that this is the opposite of the ideal. The amount of rice produced in the county is only enough to supply the county for three months. The shortfall depends entirely on imports from Jinshan, Songjiang and other places. If the source is once unsmoothed, panic will occur immediately. In addition, adjacent to Shanghai, the market price is shifted by Shanghai, and it is no wonder that it changes several times a day. Therefore, farmers are worried about the rising rice price. As for talking about the so-called "cheap grain hurts farmers," this situation is actually reversed. Furthermore, Nanhui's special products, cotton, sweet potatoes, and peanuts, are also economic sources for farmers, and they live on this. Taking cotton as an example, the handling of cotton production is currently extremely unfree, and the current market price is also cheap, almost halved (before the war, one dan of seed cotton could be exchanged for one shi of white rice, but now it can only be exchanged for five dou). In addition, the high cost of artificial fertilizers, the heavy burden of donations and taxes, and the difficulty of selling in Shanghai will inevitably lead to losses. In the past, this dilapidated rural area relied on merchants from the hometown who traveled to Shanghai to do business and salary earners who remitted money back home from time to time to make up for it. At present, the cost of living in Shanghai has soared. Except for a very small number of merchants, the rest of the salary earners traveling to Shanghai feel the pressure of life and cannot take care of themselves, let alone remit money to their hometown. Therefore, the rural economy here is becoming increasingly dilapidated. Because rural finance is exhausted, it is difficult to raise working capital. Farmers are in urgent need of money and inevitably take measures to quench their thirst with poison, resulting in the opportunity for usurious loans to rise. The illegal discounting that is prevalent here, its interest rate is shocking, and the details will be described in another chapter.</p>
<p>(2) Merchants' Life</p>
<p>After the war, Shanghai's merchants can be called natural darlings. It can be said that "all professions are inferior, only merchants are superior." But this is only true for a very small number of long-sleeved, good-dancing, wealthy merchants. The general small merchants lack capital, and they have to seek black market goods for the purchase of goods. The source of black market goods is generally trafficked from Shanghai by peddlers, and they must pay a handling fee of 30% of the price of the goods, resulting in increased costs. In addition to the profits that merchants should get, the selling price is high, and the purchasing power of the public is extremely weak. The reporter walked around the city and saw that the stores were deserted, and the shop assistants were chatting with each other, and their attitude was very leisurely. I have visited several bosses, and they all bitterly complained. It is said that the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared, and it is not easy to purchase goods in the store. At present, the city is seeing a trend that the goods in the stores are decreasing day by day, and it is not easy to replenish them. As for the export of local products, merchants also find it difficult to develop due to the heavy burden of water fees and taxes along the way and the lack of capital.</p>
<p>(3) Three Employees and Local Ruffians</p>
<p>The "three employees" here refer to shop assistants, teachers, and civil servants, and local ruffians and hooligans who act illegally. Among the three employees, shop assistants have a more prosperous life and are more stable. In addition to the shopkeeper providing food and accommodation, larger shops also have a bonus to share at the end of the year. Although the monthly salary is only about 1,000 yuan, if there is no family burden, personal life is not a problem. The most difficult are those in the education sector, whose fate seems to be destined to be inextricably linked to the word "poor." The tuition fee for primary school teachers here is only 600 yuan a month and two dou of rice (it is even less in rural towns). With this kind of treatment, the food is not enough, let alone other things. Civil servants have almost the same fate as teachers. The salary ranges from 2,100 yuan to 3,000 yuan, and they have to take care of their own food. How can this little money be enough to maintain? They are worried all day long about not having enough for three meals, and the work efficiency is naturally reduced. It is said that a civil servant from another town was in a state of melancholy all day long. He could not afford three meals. Before leaving, he sold all his bedding and obtained a small amount of money so that he could make the trip. It was also very miserable. Therefore, in my opinion, if the government wants to promote clean government and improve administrative efficiency, it must first start with improving the treatment of civil servants. As for the local ruffians and hooligans, it is really heartbreaking. Because of their powerful influence, even local officials have to treat them with respect, let alone the common people. Therefore, incidents often occur in the townships here, which is an opportunity for these people to get rich. They arbitrarily manage the villages and force merchants to sell goods on credit and use long-term checks to coerce them into exchanging them for cash. This kind of thing happens frequently.</p>
<p>(4) Three Evils of Nanhui</p>
<p>Opium, gambling, and usury are the three evils of Nanhui. According to investigations, there are nearly 10,000 opium addicts in Nanhui, where opium and gambling are prevalent everywhere in this extraordinary period, and the number of white powder customers is three or four times this number. The severity of the harm can be imagined. The 18th District is the most serious, and there are even more smokers in the coastal areas. These smokers are all middle class. Once they are addicted, they cannot extricate themselves and eventually lose their family property and become beggars and petty thieves, which has a great impact on the social order of the townships. Gambling is prevalent in all parts of Nanhui. The way to gamble is mostly held in tea houses. People gamble all night long. Therefore, although the rural and remote areas are also full of tea houses, their main business is to gather people to play mahjong. The number of wins and losses in one game is often 200,000 to 300,000, and the owner of the tea house will extract a commission according to the number. Tea is usually free. It is common for those with thriving businesses to earn millions of yuan a night, which is not surprising. The most prevalent gambling areas are Datuan in the 8th District and Sanzao in the 7th District. Villagers often run the risk of fleeing to the guerrilla areas because they owe too much debt and selling the fields is not enough to repay. This is also one of the main reasons why it is difficult to establish public security in the countryside in recent years. The rise of usury is related to opium and gambling. In order to cope with debts for a while, legitimate farmers and merchants often have to take long-term checks and ask for help from those who have cash and specialize in exploiting the poor. The highest interest rate is 11 yuan per 1,000 yuan per day. The means are so ruthless that even those in Shanghai who specialize in lending "rubber ball money" cannot compare.</p>
<p>(5) The Burden of the People</p>
<p>When the reporter first arrived here, as soon as I unloaded my luggage, I went to the streets for a stroll and found that in a small Nanhui county town, there were numerous agencies and densely packed signboards, totaling no less than 30. I wondered what these agencies usually did. After investigation, most of these are tax agencies that harm the people. The types of taxes are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For merchants and people, the general taxes include business tax, income tax, stamp tax, consumption special tax, unified tax special tax, house donation, etc. Special taxes include slaughter tax, tobacco and alcohol license tax, bamboo and wood business special tax, pig tax, tooth tax, fisheries construction fee, etc.</p>
<p>The above taxes are contracted by the Finance Bureau to merchants, and the contractors subcontract them to small contractors. The taxes are contracted at all levels, and the contractors pay a small amount of contracting fees to the higher authorities and collect exorbitant taxes from the lower authorities. The common people suffer. In fact, the tax revenue obtained by the government only accounts for 20 to 30 percent of the total. The rest is pocketed in practice. No wonder the contractors try their best to suppress the rebellion before the incident and must get the taxes before they will stop. After the incident, they all transform into wealthy men with round faces.</p>
<p>(2) For farmers, in addition to the land tax of 180 yuan per mu and the military and police rice of 150 yuan, farmers actually have to supply the local teams with in-kind requisitions, as well as the extortion of the guerrillas, and other miscellaneous taxes, which are endless, causing chaos in the rural areas today. Whenever I talked to the old farmers here about the rural situation, they all shook their heads and frowned, only calling out "What can we do?" Therefore, I believe that if we talk about improving the rural economy, we must first abolish the harsh taxes and establish public security.</p>
<p>(3) Temporary donations and taxes are temporarily collected by local autonomous organizations, including public welfare donations, cotton quilt donations, supply fees, uniform fees, and township office recurring expenses. The above donations are to offset the local budget deficit. I have now learned that the newly appointed County Chief Chen Yimeng once declared that after Nanhui was changed to a county, the land tax revenue will be at the county's own disposal, and the harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies that are temporarily apportioned will be abolished. This is undoubtedly good news for the people who have been suffering for a long time, but we should wait and see whether Chen's words and deeds will be implemented.</p>

<h3>Inventory of Warehouse Stocks to Begin Today, Municipal Authorities Hope for Cooperation from Merchants and People to Report</h3>
<p>The rising prices in this city have greatly affected the livelihood of the common people. The reason for the price increases is nothing more than hoarding and speculation, taking the opportunity to manipulate the market. After repeated discussions by the municipal authorities, it has been decided to start investigating the inventory of various warehouses and stacks in the city on the 2nd of this month. All private warehouses and stacks set up by various factories and shops, as well as similar warehouses and stacks set up by all private individuals for war preparation materials, should be reported to the authorities on a monthly basis for investigation. If any outsiders privately set up warehouses to hoard major commodities other than daily necessities, once discovered, they will be severely punished according to law. As for the large amount of materials stored by members of the same industry of major commodities, based on the amount of their capital and the total amount of business in a year, those who are not considered to have the intention of hoarding for speculation will not be interfered with. The authorities' move is purely to suppress prices and seek the welfare of the citizens. The officialdom may not be fully aware of everything. If there are any illegal hoarding activities outside the industry, merchants and people throughout the city should report them truthfully. The government and the people should cooperate. Furthermore, if any officials engaged in inspection are found to be engaging in corruption or unfairness, it is hoped that the citizens and the media will report them at any time to show fairness.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Holds Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast, Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Lu Feng Speak</h3>
<p>The "Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast" organized by this newspaper was held yesterday afternoon at the Huangpu Radio Station. First, Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, explained the significance of organizing the victory celebration broadcast, and invited Mr. Yuan Ludeng, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Lu Feng, a columnist for the New China Daily, to give speeches. Then, the broadcast program began. Members of the entertainment industry arrived on time to broadcast and sing, which was exceptionally wonderful. Yesterday, Ren Yunpeng, the executive director of the News Federation, was also responsible for the report.</p>
<p>(President Chen's speech)</p>
<p>Listeners, today the Shen Bao is organizing the Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast, and has invited Mr. Yuan Ludeng and Mr. Lu Feng to give speeches, and we are very grateful to the members of the entertainment industry for participating in the broadcast.</p>
<p>You have all seen the good news of the Allied victory in the naval battle of Taiwan and the Philippines. There are two points that we particularly value about this victory in the Taiwan-Philippines naval battle. First, the Greater East Asia War has reached a decisive stage. The victory in the Taiwan-Philippines battle has reduced the main force of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and laid the foundation for the final victory. Second, the Greater East Asia War is a war to liberate all the nations of Greater East Asia. Survival is at stake in this battle. Now that the foundation for victory has been laid due to the victory in the Taiwan-Philippines naval battle, the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of the above two points, we are particularly encouraging the public to pay attention, on the one hand to express celebration, and on the other hand to express vigilance, and to work together with greater efforts to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>(Yuan Ludeng's speech)</p>
<p>Today's Taiwan-Philippines Naval Battle Victory Celebration Broadcast program organized by China News is a very meaningful program. It is not only an event of significance to one place and one country, but also a problem that is closely related to the entire Greater East Asia. This is because the great victory won by the Allied Japan in the sea off Taiwan and the Philippines has laid a solid foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This significance has been clarified in various newspapers and magazines. I hope you will explain the significance of this victory. For 5,000 years, China has valued morality. The so-called "Dao cannot be separated for a moment, and what can be separated is not Dao." Dao is morality. From the standpoint of Dao, everyone should have a spirit of sacrifice in the war. What is the purpose of this spirit of sacrifice? It is to create the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Why do we want to create the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? It is to complete the glorious future of the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, today, all of us in Greater East Asia should strive towards this consistent policy. If there is no such effort and spirit of sacrifice, the moral significance is lacking. This meaning of Dao includes the unified direction of the front and the rear. Soldiers at the front sacrifice their lives and materials, and the rear strives to increase production, conserve materials, and live frugally to cooperate with the front in combat. This spirit is based on Dao and cannot be separated for a moment. "What can be separated is not Dao." Therefore, now all newspapers are publicizing this spirit based on this point, and there have been many detailed explanations. In order to realize the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of Greater East Asia should have this same determination. China has always valued morality. Now that the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been laid, and the destination is not far away, the Chinese people should not deviate from the spirit of Dao. They should abandon all differences in understanding and opinion, unite into the same purpose of Dao, and strive towards the path of moral spirit. The front and the rear should cooperate as one to exert this power, and future generations will be able to achieve immortal glory.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Lu Feng gave a speech with the topic "Victory in the Philippines and the Future of China," explaining that the victory in the Philippines naval battle is enough to ensure the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, which is also the dawn of China's liberation.</p>
<p>(Wonderful Programs)</p>

<h3>Symposium on Elderly Care Issues (1)</h3>
<p>Following the symposium on childcare and education on September 28th, this newspaper held a symposium on elderly care issues at 4 PM on October 1st in the auditorium of the Chinese Morality Society to examine ways to improve charitable endeavors. Representatives from various elderly care organizations and charitable elders, including Zhu Zhiyao, Ding Fubao, Gao Zihui, Xu Qianlin, Ying Yongyu, Wu Naizhong, Zhang Mali, Lu Yingen, Ren Zhonghuan, Chen Jianmin, Wu Xiaohou, Ye Shouhai, Li Qiyun, Weng Tongshi, Tang Qixiang, Nie Xingbo, Fang Zijun, Yang Zhongyi, Ye Binghua, Shen Simin, and Wang Yuhua, totaling over forty people, attended. Mr. Huang Yingwan, director of the social services department of this newspaper, chaired the meeting. During the session, everyone freely expressed their opinions on the following issues. The key points are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) The Significance of the Senior Citizens' Home Movement</p>
<p>Huang Yingwan: Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival. This newspaper is convening a symposium on elderly care issues at this time, gathering representatives from various elderly care organizations and charitable elders in one place. It embodies the hope for a full moon and long life, and "respecting the elderly in our own families, and then extending that respect to the elderly in other families" makes the discussion of elders' concerns by elders themselves all the more meaningful. At this extraordinary time, displaced elderly people are everywhere, and due to social changes, elderly care is in a precarious situation. Therefore, how to promote the senior citizens' home movement and relieve poor elderly people is our current task. We hope that all the elders will not consider themselves too old and will offer their guidance.</p>
<p>Yang Zhongyi: Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the moon is full and people are reunited. I deeply wish longevity and peace to all the elders and the elderly who are suffering.</p>
<p>Xu Qianlin: I believe that the senior citizens' home movement is the realization of Confucius's spirit of "universal love" and aims for universal harmony. Therefore, we ourselves should also promote the spirit of benevolence and righteousness and practice it ourselves, serving as a model for young people.</p>
<p>Wu Zai: I have been engaged in education for nearly fifty years and deeply understand the common ailment of Chinese society, which is selfishness and self-interest. Therefore, I hope that the elderly and the young will work together to eradicate such improper mentality.</p>
<p>Wang Huishan: The Chinese Morality Society was initially founded by a few of us old people, not for fame or profit, but to wholeheartedly help the poor and elderly, providing summer medical care and medicine to relieve the suffering of diseases. Now, the number of members is increasing day by day, and we hope that it can be popularized throughout the country to do more relief work for society, which is what we deeply hope for.</p>
<p>Jiang Danshu: Everyone will get old, and everyone should respect the elderly. Respecting the elderly today means that others will respect me when I am old. From infancy to youth, from youth to old age, this is the process of life. The elderly often contribute to society and humanity during their youth, and it is not inappropriate to be respected. Therefore, Confucius said, "The elderly should be comforted." So, the senior citizens' home movement is truly the highest expression of human morality.</p>
<p>(2) Current Status of Elderly Care Organizations</p>
<p>Huang Yingwan: I thank everyone for elaborating on the theoretical basis of the elderly care and respect for the elderly movements. Now, on behalf of the Nanshi Senior Citizens' Home, I will describe the actual situation of the elderly care movement.</p>
<p>Huang Yingwan (on behalf of the Senior Citizens' Home): The Nanshi Senior Citizens' Home is run by Catholics and has a history of over forty years. It currently houses over three hundred elderly men and women, the oldest being a certain old lady who is over ninety years old. The monthly expenses are at least 500,000 yuan. Fundraising, service, and other matters are all handled by over thirty nuns who are full of religious enthusiasm. Upholding the Catholic spirit of charity and benevolence, they dedicate their lives to elderly care, treating poor elderly people as if they were their own parents. All miscellaneous tasks such as sewing, bathing, washing, and cooking are performed by the "Mumu." Those who are sick are also cared for by the "Mumu." This spirit of "not fearing trouble" is truly admirable. Now, please have a representative from the Baoan Nursing Home report on the general situation of the home.</p>
<p>Wu Fansun: The Baoan Nursing Home is located on North Chengdu Road and has a history of seven years, housing over forty elderly people aged sixty to seventy. Due to financial constraints, only two meals are provided daily, one porridge and one rice. In their free time, they pass the time by chanting scriptures and fold paper money, with the proceeds used as pocket money.</p>
<p>Ding Fubao: Eating two meals a day is actually very healthy, especially for the elderly. There is nothing more suitable. And the best way for the elderly to pass the time is to teach them meditation, the tranquility and pleasure of which are truly higher than those of the elderly in wealthy families, and it is very conducive to longevity.</p>
<p>Wang Guoliang: Our home (the Disabled Nursing Home) was founded in the 28th year of the Republic of China, specifically to accommodate disabled refugees from the war zone and homeless elderly people. At that time, there were over 150 people. Now, due to a shortage of funds and difficulty in purchasing rice, only over 70 people can be accommodated, with the elderly accounting for a quarter of the total. In the past, the disabled and elderly engaged in simple handicrafts and rattan work as a way to pass the time and earn income. Now, in addition to eating and drinking, they pass the time by chanting scriptures.</p>
<p>Lu Yingen: Our home (the Xin Pu Yu Tang) is located on Guohuo Road in Nanshi and was established in the first year of the Republic of China, with a history of over thirty years. It occupies over eighty mu of land and has over five hundred rooms. Before the war, it accommodated as many as 3,500 people, but now there are only over 900 people, including about 150 elderly people. All departments are staffed by the "Mumu," and two meals are served daily, one porridge and one rice.</p>
<p>Huang Yingwan: The elderly care business in Shanghai, whether in terms of quantity or quality, is not as good as that in foreign countries. Now, please have Mr. Zhao Ximing report on his insights from his daily inspections.</p>
<p>Zhao Ximing: There are twelve elderly care organizations in Shanghai: (1) Five are run by charitable organizations, such as the Charity Federation, Baoan Hall, and Disabled Institute, etc. Among them, there are inconveniences such as low and humid living quarters and mixed male and female accommodations, which need to be improved. (2) Five are run by Christian organizations, totaling thirty-five people. Life is too difficult and it is not easy to maintain them, which is worrying. (3) Two are run by Catholic organizations, which have the largest scope and the best results, and there are many things that can be learned from and referenced. The above three types each have their advantages and disadvantages. In particular, the various religious organizations, based on the virtue of God's compassion for people, promote the senior citizens' home movement, and their spirit is especially admirable. Based on the above observations, I would like to put forward the following three suggestions: (1) It is hoped that the five homes run by charitable organizations, such as the Charity Federation, Baoan Hall, and Disabled Institute, etc., will be unified and divided into three homes for men, women, and the disabled, so that strength can be concentrated and management can be facilitated. (2) It is hoped that the five Christian homes will be merged into one and managed by the Salvation Army to expand their scope. (3) It is hoped that the two Catholic homes will also be divided into men, women, and the disabled, and that religious concepts will be instilled more. In addition, there is one point that deserves special mention, which is that a nursing home on Qipu Road is on the verge of dissolution due to financial constraints. Seeing dozens of homeless elderly people being forced to wander the streets and fall into ditches, in front of this vivid picture of displaced people, I dare to make a special appeal, praying that society will lend a helping hand.</p>
<p>Huang Jingwan: I thank Mr. Zhao for expressing his emotional argument. Now, please have Mr. Zhu Zhiyao speak.</p>
<p>Zhu Zhiyao: Young people respecting and caring for the elderly, creating a temporary trend, is indeed a good thing for society. However, the elderly themselves cannot rely on their age and sell their seniority. Although they are old, their hearts cannot be old. Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself. Therefore, the elderly should uphold the mandate of Heaven and work hard, engage in productive activities, and cultivate a self-respecting personality. Only then can they use their spare energy to help those who are suffering and become a model for the elderly. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yesterday Evening's Shenbao Cup Basketball: Zhongbei Defeats Mingxing; Dahua Defeats Tongren</h3>
<p>In the Shenbao Cup basketball league, Zhongbei defeated Mingxing last night with a score of 53-32. In the first half, Zhongbei played quite tensely because it did not field its formal lineup, so Mingxing led by two points with a score of 14-12. In the second half, Li Zhenzhong, Shen Yufang, and Chen Xuechong all took the field, and Mingxing was defeated.

<p>New Songsha Street at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Building on Dashanghai Road: The Zhejiang Industrial Bank in this city was organized by Zhejiang financiers Huang Yuqi, Li Sihao, Li Jisheng, Pei Yunqing, Pei Zhengyong, and others with a capital of 50 million yuan. The bank purchased over three mu of land on Qingcheng Road on Dashanghai Road to build a building, which has now been completed. Because the road east of the building does not yet have a name, it has specially requested the city government to name it. It is recently learned that the bank has received approval from the city government to name it Songsha Street. Songsha is a famous town in Zhejiang Province, and it is very appropriate to name the location of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Building after it.</p>

<h3>Proposals for Improving the Former French Concession's Water and Electricity Supply</h3>
<p>— He Kan</p>
<p>When the French possessed governing power in Shanghai, their administration policy was nothing more than clever plundering and forceful seizure, exploiting the assets of the Chinese people to supply their extravagant waste and remit back to their homeland for their government's squandering. Their police enforcement measures were the most obvious example of this policy. The Chinese people, at all times and in all places, were subjected to their exploitation, oppression, and insults. Whenever there was a dispute between two parties that could not be resolved privately and they were brought to the police station, the French police and their Chinese collaborators, acting as henchmen, would arbitrarily inflict insults and impose fines on both parties. Their aim was to display their authority and extort money. The rights and wrongs of the Chinese people were not their concern. After the Shanghai Incident occurred, the Baojia system arose in response, and the self-defense system was established accordingly. The French police officers even used this as a pretext to increase taxes and fines. When household registration certificates were issued, they forcibly sold envelopes for eight yuan per household. When citizen certificates were issued, they also forcibly sold envelopes for two yuan per set. If people forgot to bring their citizen certificates and were caught, they were fined ten yuan each time. Fines for being late or leaving early for self-defense duties were even more numerous and impossible to list. After Mayor Chen took over the French Concession, he repeatedly ordered that police officers were not allowed to arbitrarily punish the public, and this trend began to change. However, the illegal profits obtained by the French authorities were already incalculable. Now that the concession has been recovered, the electric light and tram companies are still in the hands of French merchants, which is our country's greatest mistake. What they lose in political exploitation is compensated for by the exploitation of these companies, and their methods are numerous, such as:</p>
<p>(1) Repeated increases in electricity meter deposits: - When the Central Reserve Certificates were first used, the company, citing the change in the monetary system, forced users to pay deposits that were more than 110 times the original amount. Recently, they have increased the amount again, which is equivalent to more than twenty times the amount after the first increase. For example, if the original deposit was three yuan, it was first increased to sixty yuan, and then to fourteen hundred yuan. If prices inevitably increase in the future, it is unknown to what extent this deposit will increase. The threat to the public is by no means insignificant.</p>
<p>(2) Repeated increases in water, electricity, and tram fares: - The price increases for water, electricity, and trams have been repeatedly imposed on the people by command, directly stimulating prices and increasing the burden on the people. Indirectly, it devalues the legal tender and undermines the government's efforts and painstaking efforts to maintain the management of legal tender prices. Water and electricity prices increase every one or two months, and it is unknown whether they have been formally approved by the municipal authorities. The tram company dared to increase its fares by one and a half times without the permission of our government. Although the authorities issued a formal warning, they ignored it. After seven days, although the original price was restored, the illegal overcharges were equivalent to the company's entire income for seven and a half days, which has not been returned to the public. The extent to which they treat our officials and people in this way is unbearable.</p>
<p>(3) Using the slogan of conserving water and electricity to abuse penalties. Due to the shortage of coal, the authorities have restricted the public from wasting water and electricity, so the Yongdian usage has been reduced again and again, and there are penalties to punish excessive users. However, the bureau uses this opportunity to extort money, reducing the limits at any time and arbitrarily. Sometimes, posting a small advertisement in the newspaper is used as proof of announcing the reduction of the limit. In fact, many residents are illiterate or have not had time to read it, so they do not know that the limit has been reduced again. They use it within the limit, thinking that they can avoid fines, but at the end of the month, the penalty slips arrive, ranging from hundreds to thousands of yuan. In this time of difficult living, the monthly expenses are already stretched, and suddenly a large amount of fines comes unexpectedly, beyond the residents' expectations and budget. How can our people bear this after suffering from so many problems? Reading Mr. Tu's article in the "Society Service" column of the Xinwen Bao on October 30, which questions the French water and electricity company, we can see that the company intends to deceive users. Even if you go to the company to inquire, they are not willing to tell you the new limits, and a fine notice is suddenly sent. This is actually the company using the old tricks of the police to pressure the people, specializing in fraud and exploitation as their expertise. Their intentions are despicable, dangerous, and truly unspeakable. The water and electricity company is a people's organization. I don't know who authorized them to punish users. The use of these fines is also unknown to the five mouths of people. With this company's means of deliberately trapping people and forcibly seizing their wealth, the monthly fines are probably tens of millions of gold. If our people's fat and grease are all exploited by greedy French people, it is simply terrible. Considering the above three points, the French water and electricity company's bad deeds have been obvious for a long time. All those who live in the former French Concession have suffered from poisoning. Our government is determined to liberate the people from the clutches of European imperialism, so we must eliminate evil completely. How can we tolerate harboring evil-doers and allowing them to intensify their bullying and exploitation?</p>
<p>It is predicted that the fundamental solution is to take it back and operate it ourselves as the best option:</p>
<p>(1) The municipal government should prepare funds to take it back and hand it over to a public utility for operation.</p>
<p>(2) The citizens should raise funds to take it back and operate it as a limited liability company. The citizens have been deeply hurt by the company's exploitation. If the government properly guides and leads, raising funds should not be difficult. Although the company is called a French company, when it was established, it may have misappropriated municipal revenue. This should be thoroughly investigated. If evidence is obtained, then there is no need for redemption payments, and it should be unconditionally returned by the French. As for the French staff of the company, except for a few giants who should be replaced, the rest can be temporarily accommodated or transferred to other positions before the end of the war, so that their lives are not lost, to show the generosity of our government.</p>
<p>As for the short-term solutions, they are also important. Taking it back takes time, and before it is taken back, the company's bad habits must be improved. The proposed solutions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The new water and electricity limits and the newly adjusted prices should be clearly printed in a prominent place on the previous month's bill so that users can be prepared in advance to avoid being fined.</p>
<p>(2) If the water and electricity are lost due to damage to the Yongdian lines, resulting in exceeding the limit, and it is not the user's fault, then the company shall not punish.</p>
<p>(3) Fines should not be used. It is best to deduct the amount exceeded this month from the next month. For example, if the limit is 15 degrees and the limit is exceeded by 2 degrees this month, then only 13 degrees are allowed to be used next month. If you do not comply, give a serious warning for the first and second time, and then fine for the third time. The increase in water and electricity limits is a good intention to prevent waste, not to deliberately exploit the people's wealth. It is clear that the company's abuse of power for personal gain, specializing in clever extortion and harm to users, is not the authorities' original intention.</p>
<p>(4) If users have special reasons and need to use more water and electricity, they can discuss with the company and allow them to transfer the usage and pay it back in the following months.</p>
<p>(5) For users who have been punished in the past, because of the company's improper procedures and the previous bad methods, users should be allowed to repay the excessive degrees and then return the fines taken.</p>
<p>(6) Fines should not be enjoyed by the company, but should be handed over to the municipal government for the use of citizens' welfare.</p>
<p>(7) Except for new ones, no additional deposits should be allowed for water and electricity meters. For example, the deposit previously paid was actually equal to half the value of the meter. The first increase has exceeded the actual price of the meter, which means that the meter already belongs to the user. How can the deposit be increased by taking advantage of the price increase? The seven short-term solutions above are considered to be very good and fair. Users and the company are not enemies. The company's survival depends on users. For the company's sake, it should not specialize in making things difficult for users and inciting ill will. In these difficult times, although a few nouveau riche are well-off, the general public is suffering unspeakably. The company cannot bully users with its superior position to increase their pain. It is hoped that the wise authorities will negotiate with the company as soon as possible, first implement the short-term solutions to reassure the people, and then discuss the methods of taking it back in the long term. If the company is stubborn and refuses to comply, the authorities should force the takeover or impose a heavy surtax so that it cannot operate. Sovereignty is in our hands, how can we allow it to be abandoned?</p>
<h3>Review of the Japanese Shunyo-kai Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Qian Shoutie</p>
<p>Several dozen of the finest pieces from the 24th Shunyo-kai Exhibition, represented by Mr. Kiyoshi Mizutani, are being displayed at the Continental Gallery, from October 30th to November 4th. The works include ink paintings and oil paintings, and my overall assessment is that they possess a sense of antiquity, simplicity, clarity, and vigor. For example, Mr. Hoan Kosugi's "Early Spring" is vividly lifelike, and his brushwork is between the ethereal and the excellent. Mr. Kazumasa Nakagawa's "Meaning of Poems from Manyoshu" is pleasingly rustic. The light colors of Mr. Shohachi Kimura and Mr. Tsuruzo Ishii each have their own charm. The oil paintings of Mr. Shiro Kayama, Mr. Genichiro Adachi, Mr. Tojiro Maeda, Mr. Kakujiro Yokobori, and Mr. Tokusaburo Kobayashi are all strong hands in Shunyo-kai, each with their own merits. Mr. Kanenosuke Oka's "Three-Colored Lotus" has elegant colors and is quite decorative, as wonderful as Southern Song Dynasty sketches. Mr. Kiyoshi Mizutani is a strong general in Shunyo-kai and the beloved son-in-law of Mr. Hoan. He has traveled to India for several years and has visited our country many times. He is honest and sincere, and his oil paintings have clear and elegant colors and broad brushstrokes, comparable to Matisse. The style of Shunyo-kai is enough to promote the Eastern spirit, and even Western painters lament that their brushes cannot reach it. The members of Shunyo-kai are all my old friends, and seeing their paintings is like meeting them in person, so I am happy to write this.</p>
<h3>Pity the Elderly in Their Twilight Years, Generously Help the Home for the Aged</h3>
<p>Goal: Five Million Yuan</p>
<p>Period: November 10th</p>
<p>Collection Point: Social Services Department of this Newspaper</p>
<p>The Shanghai Home for the Aged, due to the high cost of everything, finds each day like a year. They have initiated a fundraising campaign and have received the support of ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life, who sympathize with their plight and cultivate both blessings and virtues, generously giving and donating, which is admirable. However, the amount is still far from the fundraising goal. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will think of their hunger and cold, pity their difficulties, and rise up to help with benevolence, rely on righteous millet to continue their lives, extend our care from our own elders to the elders of others, promote the virtue of filial piety, and help those in difficulty during difficult times, and they will surely receive auspicious rewards.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mr. Wu Jianjia, stating: "I am writing to inform you that I had some daily necessities stored with my classmate Mr. Yao last year. Later, because I needed them, I asked him to return the original items, but Mr. Yao said that they had already been used. After repeated negotiations, there was no result. Now, thanks to the mediation of Mr. Zhong Delin, Mr. Yao has compensated me with 16,000 yuan, which is only worth two-tenths of the price of the goods. However, Mr. Zhong has worked hard and compensated 4,000 yuan, so this matter can be concluded. Therefore, I will donate the national currency of 4,000 yuan to the Home for the Aged to create blessings for Mr. Zhong, and I hope that this letter will be published in the newspaper."</p>
<p>Donations Received: Pan Bingchen 30,000 yuan. Chen Dai's 20,000 yuan. Zhang Wenkui, Huang Mingyao, Anonymous (1072), Gao Peiliang, Wu Jinrong, Changji (the above three households were raised by Lin Kanghou) each 10,000 yuan. Anonymous (receipt 1069) 5,000 yuan.
