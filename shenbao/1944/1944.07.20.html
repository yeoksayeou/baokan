<p>社評</p>
<h3>市政機關合併之前</h3>
<p>本市市政機關於八月一日起正式合併。本來，去年租界接受以後，當時因適應環境，承襲原有租界區域，分區設著，現在已經一年了，爲實現名符其實的行政統一，自應從遠　整合倂。</p>
<p>據一般觀察，對於市政機關的合併，現在有兩種主張，一種是主張徹底的全面革新。一種是主張保守的維持現狀。可是，我們必須認識目前上海的嚴重環境，非全面革新不足以維持現狀。我們對於目前上海的地位，所屬的環境，已經屢次指出其嚴重性。如不積極消滅危機，則嚴重性有加無已。所以，主張　守者，適以坐視嚴重性質增加，而不足以維持現狀。</p>
<p>今年三月十三日本報社評「革新上海第一課」，我們曾說：上海市無論在過去與現　　在，都可以說是全國經濟，文化，教育的中心，就政治重心而言，除首都以外，也爲全國各地冠。自從大東亞戰爭以後，上海更全爲後方重要基地之一·多以，從全中國或大東亞範圍以觀，上海居於極重要地位，換言之，上海的一切動態，對於中國各地及大東亞範圍，很有影響的作用·我們可以斷言，上海如能革新，則可以影響促成全中國革新，可以真實協同爭取大東亞戰爭勝利。</p>
<p>所以，我們認識爲上海的革新是必要的，而且必須徹底的全面革新。市政機關的　整合併，母寗說是準備全面革新的張本。在市政機關　整合併之前，有兩個問題尤其值得重視：第一是治安間題。上海居於大東亞決戰中後方重要基地的地位，發揮一切力量貢揮一切力量的先決條件，一方面是內在的努力，一方面是外圍的保障。所謂外國的保障，就是確保治安，維護治安。第二十財政間題。財政是一切行政的命脈，凡是服務公職人員，以期提高服務效率，配合革新的責任，均須有安定的待遇。其次，政治設施以及各種新政推行，在在需要求是的經費，所以，財政必須公開，稅收必須整理，市政機關的出納不可各自爲政，必須統收統支，並確</p>
<p>此外，我們希望市政當局在合併之前，注意左列諸事：</p>
<p>對於前公佈局所有之優良制度，值得採用者，自不必因人廢事，應加保留採用，優秀技術人才以及服務戰久的職員，職員繼續服務者，尤須充分保留。</p>
<p>公務人員服務規則，從速重行擬定，注意統一。同時，將公務人員所應獲得之各項保障，以及獎懲辦法，詳細規定列明，以期安定服務之心。</p>
<p>市府及各局處幹部人員，人選頗關重要，應規定標準，重加甄別，以人才為主，使在合併之時，人事上耳目一新。第一區公署原有「人事委員會」之設立，我們希望市府在市政機關合併前，關於人事甄別，應特設「人事委員會」認真考核，絕對採攻人才主義，務使冗員不致插足，提高行政效率。</p>
<p>最後，我們希望市政當局確立一個最完善的行政制度，然後配合健全的人事。如果沒有完善的制度，那未，人事也不會健全的，但是有了完善的制度，而沒有健全的人事，結果也不會發揮制度的優點。所以，完善的制度，與健全的人事，必須等量齊觀，不可偏忽。我們希望上海成為全國政治的模範區，這次得合併，就是一個最適當的革新機會，願當局及時把握之。</p>
<h3>適應現階段戰局增強船舶輸送力　海的紀日近藤武官長談話</h3>
<p>盟邦上海近藤海軍武官長於海之紀念日發表談話，題為大東亞戰爭之現階段，與船舶輸送力之重要性。茲誌如下：</p>
<p>凡戰鬥與補給，均為戰爭所并重，兩者具有密切不離之關係。在戰勝時以能充分補拾，此為必要條件，所謂枵腹難以作戰是也。由此可見袖給問道於戰爭所具之重要性。憶昔日將盟臣秀吉征伐朝解時，結果龍頭蛇各而終，此亦不外為補給缺乏而已。補給於戰爭，從廣義解釋之，即集資源之開發，原料之輸送，戰爭必需物資之生產，及生產品之進往戰塲，及其他方面等均包括在內。其中於輸送方面，計有海上輸送，陸上輸送，空中蝓送等，此次大東亞戰爭之主要戰塲在太平洋，其區域在廣家數千里海面關係，故船舶輸送問題，屬於補給之最大重要事項，無需贅言，故此次戰爭謂為船舶輸送力之戰爭，亦屬此理。船舶輸送力之問題，不僅為原料武器彈藥糧食等之運援，於此次太平洋作戰中，作戰輸送實係一戰之一部，且有極重要任務，是則不難想像之也。現船舶輸送力之維持增强，與航空戰力之增强，同為日本戰捷之關鍵，敵方亦以各種方策，汲汲於减低日本船舶之輸送力，此由敵機之活動狀况觀之，實極明願，故我人現必須動員所有努力與克服一切困難，傾全力於維持增進船舶鹼送力量。</p>
<p>船與船員必須優秀</p>
<p>船舶輸送力，主要為船與船員之問題，以優秀之船舶大量運往戰塲塲，劂屬必要，并且一方更需要優秀技術之船員，於敵潛水飛機活躍之潛上，書夜不斷　戒，期切航行安全實非易事。平時尚須與風浪及寒暑搏戰，戰時則因作戰之要求，更須與時間作戰，故必須克服此等危險與困難，作　緩行動，此種勞苦無異第一綫陸海軍將兵。船員諸君，得負起與陸海軍同樣之使命，亦屬義不容辭。關於增强船舶輸送力，與陸上居住者亦有關係，應協力之點極多。第一為增進運貨能率，假如二日可辦之事情，延遲至三日四日，是與船腹减少幾萬噸之結果相同，此理甚明。又極力减少船舶之修理期間，亦屬同樣必要，船員於海上極九與一切困難危險作戰，始行安全入港，故於輕船舶入港期間，必須吉利減輕船員之負擔，務使彼等獲得充分休　機會，俾可踴躍，為任務邁進，此為陸上配置之當然任務。第二，為應徹底限制不急要之貨物運輸及旅行，假如有利用其地位與身份，致累及有緊要事務之旅行者，或以不急之物件占據貴重之船腹，此種事實足以　妨害戰爭之遂行，理應嚴加糾　正也·第三，凡海上勤務之有經騐者，必須認識現下時局與船舶輸送力，維持增强之重要性，於任何調遣時，均立刻有所準備，同時應堅定意志牢記缺少船員一人，即可减退若干之船舶輸送力也。又一船父兄應認識船舶輸送力，陸海軍丘力同樣為戰爭遂行上之極重要任務並希望其益加積極協力船員方面則遣送其優秀之子弟也。</p>
<p>決戰階段更爲需要</p>
<p>開戰以來，日船舶陣營一船元諸君之之活動，實極諸著，寒暑風浪不必言，或與敵機及沿績作戰，或突破機雷也，毅然執行其任務。此事至堪欽佩·其間所引為愛國美談者，誠不勝枚舉，其熱誠可嘉。現火東戰爭愈進入決戰階段，增强船舶輸送力，乃屬絕對必要，其有愛國熱誠之靑少年男子，應默默遂行此種極重要任務，參加日船舶陣營，發揮海國男子之本領，以貢獻於船舶輸送力之增進·又居住陸上者，縱於塞暑風雨中，幾多忠勇之船舶輸送戰士，今仍與一切危險困難搏戰，此種熱誠可感。同時均望其傾注全力於各本位，為完遂戰爭而　進也。際茲四四海的紀念日，爰供一言，藉申所見云爾。</p>
<h3>日翼政會舉行　臨時代議士會　通過國結擊滅英美決議</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日本翼政會，鑒於目戰局之嚴重，十九日於該會本部特舉行臨時代議士命議，出席有前田總務會長，岡田眾議院議長等二百八十人，由山崎代議士主席，首由前田總務會長報告現下之戰局及政情，繼由武知起勇氏提議謂：茲以塞班鳥戰局為機，一億人民應團結一致，堅持擊滅英美之最大目的，結果全塲一致予以通過。</p>
<h3>我駐日武官　房松村部長</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　中國駐日大使官陸　武官王維藤。本日午前訪問日陸軍省松村報道部長，對塞班島日將士壯烈戰死之忠節表示敬意，並致哀悼之辭，披　中國與日民　以舉　日將士及　　該地日民眾之精神爲準備，中日兩國今後愈　團結一致，互相提攜，向東亞最後勝利之途　進。</p>
<h3>大東亞省舉行　製鐵協議會</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日大東亞省以上次視察鮮滿華北方面完舉歸任之藤原國務大臣爲中心，十九日上午於此間舉行　北蒙踵製鐵協議會，出席靑木大東亞相以下各閣係官，日本製鐵，日本　實，中山製鋼各社長，華北開發，華北製鐵，滿洲　鐵，龍晶鐵鑛，豪經興　，山西鑛產，開溁製鐵　各關係者，各就華北蒙　方面之製鐵增產事宜，　行種種協議。</p>
<h3>塞班島決戰經過　日軍總攻前舉行杯互祝壯舉　旋共同突入敵陣全員殉國</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電塞班島日軍守備隊，於七月七日以怒濤之勢對敵軍敢行總攻，迄今綜合各方報告及其他消息，知於戰事之最後一瞬間，日軍全員戰死之經緯如次：　於總攻擊前最高指揮官及全體將士共同舉杯互祝壯舉，高呼萬歲，祈國逕無窮，對友軍之莫大援助，亦作深甚感謝，全體將兵共同突入敵陣。　重傷病兵三千名，均自決能行動者則全體携帶武器，無武器者初持竹槍或其他手槍武器，以一當十之勇氣，術向敵陣，日軍守衛隊於七月七日作最後之總攻擊，於是役後殘存之日軍仍繼續於各地作游擊戰，依據溝穴或其他陣地，以少數兵員作極强之活動，敵軍深引以為蕘，直至最後之一盼間，遂壯烈全員戰死。</p>
<h3>日軍守備隊　奮勇作戰實況　日陸海軍報導部長談話</h3>
<p>東京十八日中央社電　關於塞班島戰鬥經過，及該島守備隊全部壯烈陣亡實情，日大本營陸海軍報道部長，曾共同發表談話如次：六月上旬敵美有力機動部隊出現於馬利亞納諸島東方，最初即以艦載機百九十架，轟炸塞班島，十二日以二百數十機再襲該島，十四日該島西南海岸奧列阿機塲附近，受敵美軍砲擊，敵美且以航空母艦十數艘，戰艦八艘，大型輸送船七十艘左右之海軍勢力為基幹，裝戰士兵，實行上陸。十五日晨間始猛烈砲擊，七時許敵軍在三百餘艘舟艇掩護下，企圖於該島於西南海岸奧列阿附近登陸，經日軍守備隊猛烈邀擊，不支潰退，敵受損甚大，是日午後，敵軍一部佔據斯斯別角近地區，其後逐漸擴大，該地日軍部隊目敵軍熾烈之砲火，繼續反攻，戰至傍晚，僅於肉據戰中，即破壞敵戰車十餘輛，其戰况之激烈，可想而知。</p>
<p>水源地帶全部被毀</p>
<p>日空軍并擊沉敵戰艦，巡洋艦各一艘，並擊毀共巡艦二艘，日陸軍砲隊亦將敵軍滿載兵員之舟艇擊沉，或擊毀者極多，敵軍恃兵力雄厚，不顧一切犧性，以一師之兵力，強行登陸，十六日由於日軍之猛攻，敵軍無有進展，日軍於是日夜問由東方及北方實行夜襲，一部份突入斯斯別角，將敵南北分斷，使陷於混亂狀態，十七日拂曉，日軍因遭敵軍猛烈砲擊，不得已而再度撤退，此後在敵軍各方之空襲或砲擊之情况下，日軍損害逐日增加，十九日日軍乃從事理加拉邦市街道及　灣中央之陣地，奧列阿機場阿斯利特機塲，於二十日同時陷落，他方日艦隊之一部，為迎擊敵軍艦隊，即時開始行動，敵美南太平洋方面艦隊亦北上應戰，於十九，二十兩日在瑪利亞納西方海面發生猛烈之遭遇戰，其詳情等由大本營發表矣，如是延至二十三日夜十二時，塞班島水源地全部被毀，該島本係取法水源之地，致用水陷與困難狀態，而掌握制控制海權之地方砲射擊轟炸又復日　一日，最後已逞其猛威於全島。</p>
<p>不眠不休與敵激戰</p>
<p>日軍不眠不休與之激戰者旬餘日，而損害逐次增大，敵艦艇探照燈之照射及照明彈之夜襲，更使部隊行動困難，二十五日奧其第一綫已保有加拉邦市街至塔謠高山南旋，達賴泥一帶有戰車之各處敵軍部隊突行前進，斯時戰綫漸次呈犬牙相錯之狀，在如此激戰之中，日軍亳不萎縮，均抱炸彈衝入敵陣地，使敵胆戰心寒。二十六日晚塔保喬山終被攻陷，該高地乃為塞班島之最高條，敵軍立即自該高地南側調來砲兵，戰况驟然不到於我軍。二十八日敵之攻擊愈爲熾烈，日軍之火砲殆全毀壞，砲彈幾乎全部射盡，然仍奮勇應戰，日劇部隊之一部，在敵之包圍中，猶能維持塔保　高地南側及東南方等據點，力阻前方敵軍之北進，隨之戰況　告聚急點之大津中隊，曾急襲撓有輕迫擊砲五六門，照明班七八組之敵陣，迨接到復歸命令時，復以僅餘之十五名兵員突破數綫敵陣，擊滅守兵百五十名，覆滅敵指揮所後，始歸大隊，類此勇敢之行動，到處可見。六月二十一日以來，日軍機隊及海上部隊為助地上戰鬥，有利於我軍，速日果敢轟炸敵陣及物質集續所與飛機塲等，使全部化為灰燼，一方並攻擊行動於塞班島週邊海上之敵器艇，擊沉其空母二艘，輸送船一艘，擊毀巡洋艦一艘，　種不明者一艘，毀敵陣地三十餘處</p>
<p>日軍所獲赫赫戰果</p>
<p>自六月十一日，敵機動部隊來襲馬利亞納羣島，日軍機隊及海上部隊所獲之戰果如次：　擊沉航空母艦二艘，戰艦三艘，巡洋艦四艘，驅逐艦三艘，潛艇一艘，艦種不明者二艘，輸送船二艘·　擊沉擊破航空母艦五艘以上，戰艦一艘以上。　擊毀航空母艦無搜以上，戰艦一艘以上。　擊毀航空母艦五六艘，戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅遂艦三艘，艦種未明者一艘，輸送船七錢、　擊落飛機八六三架以上，唯未能使敵軍拋棄其企圖，實爲這憾之至·日軍作戰部隊，於六月十七日蒙天皇陛下嘉賞，六月三十日復榮欽賜將兵士氣為之一振，於感激之餘，矢誓擊滅敵軍，戰至最後一卒為止，然苦鬥二句，日軍損耗殆盡，而敵軍砲火益趨熾烈，其地上兵力已達三師之眾，屢次乘隙突進日軍陣地。七月四日，日軍戰綫已被迫由塞班島東北部之以那巴克（二二一）高地縮退至他　喝奧綫，能應付敵軍之砲已無一門，武器奇缺，僅以肉搏，阻止敵軍之攻擊，五日更退至最北端馬比山附近地區，斯時日軍約三千名負傷，三七土兵自動燒毀重要書類，該日夜間接受最後之攻擊命令，全員突擊敵軍陣地，且根據該項命令，即時組成約五十組軍隊深人敵軍陣地，搜索敵司令部，宿營地，炸砲飛機等，予以破壞，使其內部這到</p>
<p>最後全力壯烈攻擊</p>
<p>七日晨舉全力向敵軍登陸點加朗卡諾西附近作最後之壯烈攻擊，是　日軍陸海空軍一　，於　方面海軍最高指揮官南　中將，陸軍部隊指揮官　藤中將，海軍部隊指揮　社加少將指揮下，繼續經戰，全軍戰死，此種壯列激戰狀況，日空軍已由　察中知悉，尤其日本在　居民如大本營前所發表始終協力作戰，此種為國　驅之誠心，誠感天地而泣鬼神也·塞班島之戰鬥。敵美軍自認為太平洋作戰中極困難而激烈之戰鬥。據其發表稱：七月十日以前之損害，達一萬五千餘名，其數字之消滅，自　意料，而就其公布置數字已甚客觀，且關於　後之發動突擊命令時，現能指揮官回報告如次：一有負天皇陛下聖　，未克充首　，大津中隊戰發揮皇軍眞髓勇猛之情，不　枚舉，目下將兵死得其所，確信皇國必勝，國運無噩，謹此致意」。日本國民必將確信舉國必勝，殉於大義之將兵，予以報答，值斯驕敵將進本土之時，必發揮皇軍傳統精袖，以殲滅敵軍。</p>

<p>華南前綫某基地十九日中央社電　自六月二十七日，開始進攻重慶第七戰區之華南日軍精銳各部隊，目下到處展開巧妙殲滅戰，使渝軍完全陷於混亂狀態。於北江西北方北進中之日軍主力，己確保第七戰區防衛韶關第一錢之連江南方高地堅固陣地，整備攻英繼迫韶關之勢。日軍某部隊追擊渝軍第百五十九師，迫至連江南岸地區，目下正展開包圍殲滅中。另一有力部隊亦正自廣州西北地區，追擊　滅遁逃中之渝軍第百五十六師，十二日夜半至十三日十二時，渝軍第百五十二師之一團於從化東北万地區，完全被包圍殲滅，遺屍數百具，被虜多人，日軍更鹵獲迫擊砲輕機槍步槍彈藥等甚多，予渝軍以甚大打舉。據渝第七戰區司令長官余漢謀，始終企圖死守韶關，頻頻督戰，更反覆增派援軍，企圖死守，並對連江北岸之渝軍第百五十四師，獨立第九隊，不斷由韶關方面增派援軍，企圖防備連江北方之第二陣綫。目下渝軍向從化北方地區移動者，為北江東岸之百八十七師，及本月初旬被日軍迂迥部隊痛擊之百五十三師，及已臨潰滅狀態之敵第百五十二師，故江北山地之大殲滅戰即將展開。</p>
<p>敵美飛機</p>
<p>擾亂後方中國前綫日軍某基地十九日中央社電　日空軍之猛烈攻勢，使駐渝美空軍節節敗退，現積極整備補充工作，試觀美機最近之活動狀況，業知其戰法已有變化。去年多以戰轟聯合編隊，於白畫出動，今春以來，特在日空軍開始攻勢以後，其轟炸機於畫問均不出動，而僅以少數之戰鬥機，載小型炸彈，赴戰塲作戰。使用轟炸機時，多選夜間，其目標在於擾亂後方。敵機變化戰法之理由，要不外企圖減少損害，此又為心神恐怖之一明證。敵軍現仍以戰轟聯合大隊，由大陸出擊，然因恐被日機戰鬥精銳發見，又不得不設法逃遁，以至於不敢再向目標地點繼續侵攻。所以日軍機隊更將於大陸上空展開得意之追繫戰，以期殲滅敵機於蠢動之前云。</p>
<h3>襲大宮島敵機　擊落廿一架</h3>

<p>為尼刺十九日由央社電　菲律賓日軍當局，鑒於向日調整軍需物資及開發資料之手續有失完備，授予奸商投機之隙，致促物價暴漲，茲為興利除弊，抑平物價起見，特計劃設立一公共收買機關，頃已準備就緒，十七日菲律賓物資購買供給公會遂正式成立。十八日駐菲律實陸海軍當局並發表書面談話，謂該公會乃日本駐菲律賓陸海軍所設之機關，於日駐菲陸海軍物資調整共同委員會指導監督下，辦理一切收買軍需物資及有關開發各物資等事宜，此外，一般日　人商公司，均禁止從事。</p>
<h3>日國內鉻鑛　決全面開發</h3>
<p>東京十九日中央社電　日軍需省非鐵金屬局，鑒於普通鋼特殊鋼之重要原種之　鑛，需要孔股，為確立永久之確係體制，自今年七·八·九月起，對仰賴於海外之移入，加以改善，決定全面開發國內故鑛。目下日本國內主要　鑛，埋藏地為北海道及中國地方，開發現狀，北海道方面以採鑛遲滯關係，生產較低，中國地方鑛質優良，生產亦佳。關於兩地方之緊急增產具體計劃，目下正由軍需省非鐵金屬局及礦統制會，礦石配給統制公司等協力研究中。北海道方面之生產，由強化勞動資材遝輸各關係，即可增加。中國地方亦因生產要素之具備，亦將有飛躍之增產，故日本內地　鑛業界，以充足增大需要為目的，迅速獲得增產體制，實為當務之急，是故開發者之心得，經營上之刷新，生產上之躍進，頗俱期待。</p>
<h3>地中海英空軍　參謀長易人</h3>

<h3>烏克蘭綫蘇軍　展開新攻勢　北路德軍抵抗力增强</h3>
<p>瑞典京城十九日中央社電　蘇軍當局十八日夜發表：哥納夫指揮之烏克蘭戰綫蘇軍，在有力砲兵及空軍之掩護下開始進攻，三日間繼續擊林堡（即勒伏甫）方面之德軍陣地。並稱穌軍於十五日在柯維爾區及泰諾波爾西北開始攻勢。</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期一之戰事主要重心，係在勃來斯特里托夫斯克之東及東北方及尼門河一帶格羅特諾之兩側。蘇軍於星期一以步槍隊數師團及坦克車兩隊，自東北方沿數公里闊之戰綫來攻，企圖奪取勃萊斯特里托夫斯克，並於此項部隊形成突破缺口時，即以騎兵為繼，初時蘇軍曾席捲德軍之陣綫，而向西南前進數公里，但此際德軍即自南北兩面向敵側翼包抄，阻遇蘇軍之攻勢。格羅特諾區之蘇軍於星期一淸晨，曾在尼門河西岸獲建橋頭堡數處，但德軍機械化及坦克車部隊將蘇軍逐回至該河東岸，然後以連續之砲火加以　擊，使蒙重創。格魯特諾之北，德軍因欲消除蘇軍橋頭堡數處，因而引起激烈之戰鬥，星期一晚全夜激戰不休，至昨晨更加激烈。格魯特諾東及東南方之德軍，於星期一在防禦戰中獲得完全成功，該處蘇軍曾達到尼門河右岸，但遭德軍反攻，退至原來陣地。</p>
<h3>義東岸激戰　德軍北移</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：日昨義境極東翼之戰事特別激烈，至午後英坦克車二師團即對波　步兵予以支援，入晚德軍退入安科納港（Ancona）局圍之防禦圈內，該圈內整晚發生激戰。</p>
<h3>桑洛爭奪戰現達最高潮　奧納東岸敵攻勢受挫</h3>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　西歐德軍司令部十八日發表：桑洛廢墟之戰鬥，行見達於最高潮，美軍由東北西三方面逐步　續前進，十八日晨德軍降落傘兵與美軍於距該市東方二公里之地點，演成白刃戰，於北方亦展開激烈之遭遇戰。美軍戰鬥部隊進抵桑洛。比里埃公路後，即分為兩隊，一方向桑洛另一方向比里埃同時前進，而德軍則隨時與之奮戰</p>
<p>柏林十九日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：最近二日來，在克恩區與桑洛區之諾曼第防禦大戰，於星期二日之作戰過程中，似已擴展至奧納河之東。在過去四十八小時內已趨活躍之英砲火，自十八日淸晨起已改為掩護砲火，同時英軍以近程轟炸機與主力機數百架開始行動，其目的顯然在於擊破德軍之防禦。英軍高級司令部之目的，似乎由南方西方與東方向奧納河與克恩之南，對克恩區之德軍陣地貫澈一種鉗形行動。關於英坦克車與步兵對奧納河口東岸進攻之情形尚無消息，英軍於星期一日以新到之坦克軍與步兵師團在瑪爾托區與伐特斯區，於砲火掩護下，連續對德軍陣綫進逼，但終未能獲得決定性之突破。在過去二日內，屢得屢失之淸琪與諾伊兩地，最後於十八日上午復入德軍手中。美軍防區作戰之焦點，在於桑洛地區，該處的軍撤退至市鎭附近，以避免不必要之損失，並節省德軍之決戰力。目下德軍之陣綫在桑洛之東北與北，離城郊約一公里之遙，同時在西方之陣綫則離城市更遠，德軍所據守之山岳陣地，在美軍極强之進攻下屹然不動。</p>
<h3>本參戰決心協助盟邦　爭取最後勝利　林宣長為塞班島戰事發表談話</h3>
<p>南京十八日中央社電　林宣傳部長為塞班烏戰事，發表談話：「本日盟邦大本營發表塞班島戰事消息，自本月七日以來，盟邦軍隊即在該島作最後攻擊，予敵以重創，戰至最後全體壯烈犧牲，即該島日僑，亦與陣地共存亡，這種壯烈犧牲的精神，是日本軍民精忠報國之最大表現，也就可以說在戰爭史上，代表東亞民族所獲得無上的光榮，絕不是一島一地之得失，所可計較，這是首當表示無限的敬意的。無疑的在這個時候，重慶方面以及華盛頓方面，一定大放厥詞。本月七日，蔣介石先生早就拿塞班島戰事，來掩飾其在平漢粵漢兩綫戰事的慘敗，就是他也不能不自已承認局勢的嚴重，他祇好輕描淡寫的說，此次的慘敗，好在不是在五年以前，而在五年以後，其內心的苦痛，也就可想而知了。重慶方面，就拿傘塞班島的戰事來宣傳，也不過巷別人吹打，為自己內心的苦痛掩飾而已。</p>
<p>美國海軍勞師襲遠</p>
<p>華盛頓方面呢，戰爭的魔手也必然借此次戰事來煽動，使美國人民「在戰爭底下，久已呌苦連天的美國人民」，再一度受瘋狂的刺激。然而美國海軍裹頭，不會沒有一些軍事專家的戰略上的利害得失，料想到前途的艱難危險，眼看着這種瘋狂的宣傳，不祇失笑，簡直要寒心。</p>
<p>為甚麼呢？這一次日本在太平洋對美國的戰爭，以近代兵法的術語，可以說是以有限目的的戰爭，對「無限目的」的戰爭。照我國古代兵法的術語，可以說是「以逸待勞」的戰爭，這是由於戰略形勢所決定，人力所能總變的。所謂以有限目的的戰爭，對無限目的的戰爭，就是說盟邦日本在第一期以最迅速的行動，最經濟的力量，奪取了美國在太平洋的根據地之後，立刻反攻為守，等待美國勞師襲遠，如今美國正是犯着兵法上勞師襲遠的大忌，這些地方的得失，早已在盟邦戰略計算之中，不足為異的。</p>
<p>日對戰事取得優勝</p>
<p>在美國方面呢，他要反攻日本，不要說勝利，戰要說不敗，就首先要在太平洋建立到一個海軍根據地，一方面要使敵方在其艦隊行動圈以內，這個圈的半徑不能超過三千英哩，一方面後方的補充給養護航要有絕對的安全把握。照此計算，美國反攻日本祇有三條路綫，如今所走着的，正是軍事專家所謂最危險最困難的一條路。塞班島之形勢，絕對做不到這個根據地，是任何人所知道的。怎樣纔建立得到一個根據地呢？能否建立得一個根據地呢？？全要看美國襲建的勞師，再有沒有更勞師的襲遠的能力。這不是說美國想不想而是說美國能不能，也就是說全要看美國的軍隊，能否再經受得起更慘重的損失，更險惡的出血戰爭。無論如何，在日本於第一期有限目的的戰爭，取得了優勢以後，如果美國以為在第二期無限目的戰爭中，一個地方得手，便忘記了勞師製遠的大忌，那不祗是瘋狂，簡直是愚蠢。所謂以逸待勞，就是說巳把自己的主力保持在最堅固的陣綫裹。於最短的距離作戰上，當敵人來襲最遠而又最勞師的時候。乘着最優勢的機會予敵人以最後的全面的致命的打擊。直至現在為止，人人知這美國已出盡九牛二虎之力，來執行這一次無限的目的的反攻，而事實上，主力戰爭還未開，最後勝敗之數，也就不待龜卜而可決了。短視的人，常常說為什麼直到現在日本還不拿出主力來邀擊呢？說這種話的人，既不明白以逸待勞的法則，也不瞭解海軍攻守的戰術，海軍作戰不是為戰爭而戰爭，完全要在攻守戰爭目標上面，打算為戰爭而戰爭，一塲戰爭的勝敗是無足輕重的，這是海上戰和陸地戰的根本不同的地方。這一點重慶方面的人也許不明白，可是美國方面至少有些人應該知道的</p>
<p>為大東亞爭取光榮</p>
<p>還有一點，海上作戰的力量包括三個要素一：一個是艦隊，一個是根據地，一個是人力。所謂艦隊不單是兵艦的數量或質量，而是這些兵艦在運用上所能夠發揮的力量，這就是說，不單是他的靜態的力量，最要緊的是他的動罷的力量，作戰的距雕，以及給養補充，對於這動態的力量所關實大，就這一點上說，日本是佔絕大優勢的。所謂根據地，也不是祗有一塊地而已，這一塊地地勢如何，環境如何，尤其是對本土的距闡如何，都要計算淸楚。就這一點上說，日本也是絕對優勢的。所謂人力也不僅在人的數量上，尤在人的鬥志，我們看看阿茲島盟邦軍隊全體的壯烈樣牲，看看這一次塞班島盟邦軍隊，以及僑民全體的壯烈犧牲，再想起那一次養國所謂兵精糧足的六萬大軍，不堪一戰，便已慘敗，而他們還說僥倖沒有一個傷亡。為什麽沒有傷亡呢？因為一戰即敗，一敗即降，兵精糧足的六萬大軍，巳成了自願投降的俘虜了。以此相對，日美兩方軍民的鬥志，真可說是天壤之別。如此看來，就算羅斯福有勞師遠襲之心，真不知美國可以遠到什麼地方？又可以勞到什麼時候？更不知這些士兵的父母妻子對着這幾天瘋狂的宣傳，想起自己的兒子或丈夫的命運，又有什麽感想？</p>
<p>日本軍民鬥志是日本民族先天生來，再加以後天練成的，這種鬥志在第一次對外大戰爭，已經為東亞民族，爭取了光藥。在這一次大東亞戰爭中，更處處的表現出來，決戰勝利的把握，就建立在　上面，何况戰略上的優勢兼而有之。我們於此對於盟邦軍民英勇作戰，於感激與慚愧之餘，惟有一本參戰的決心，加倍努力。一方面動員人力物力，協助盟邦，爭取最後勝利。一方面以最後的期待，促重慶的覺悟，使八好河山，不再為英美所利用，作其戰塲，供其犧牲。」</p>
<h3>海國日本的船員精神</h3>
<p>船與海員的任務</p>
<p>此次戰爭與以前的戰爭特別不同的，是以涉洋奇襲，敵前登陸為始，且陸海軍均以渡洋作為終始。所以，如何完遂海上運輸，在戰爭上造成重大影響，乃不待言喻。在這國家的重要任務上，船隻，海員，今正發揮其全部機能與能力，繼續活躍着。</p>
<p>開戰以來，我們的航員如影隨形地跟着在奮勇戰鬥的日軍背後之運輸船團，不屈不撓的奮鬥着。進則　着敵方猛烈的空炸與砲擊，協助敵前登陸，退則突破敵潛水艦活躍的危險海面，盡着運輸的任務。於是我們的船員，胸頭祇挺着滿腔鬥志：「好的，來就來吧！何懼之有！」「去吧！」「鬥吧！」</p>
<p>若無其事的拋錨向危險的海洋出航。</p>
<p>滲血般的猛訓</p>
<p>依着綫路走的火車，在猛雪之夜，尙須苦鬥。何况在浩無渺際的大海，濃霧，風雪，颶風等不斷襲來，敵機，敵潛水艇接一連二的迫近頭上與舷側，在嚴密的燈火管制下前進的船團，不分心畫夜的作想像不及的辛勞苦鬥。忍受這些辛苦，突破這些危險，克盡厥資的日本船員的浩氣中。實施着滲血般的猛訓。一旦起航，生死置之度外，運輸戰士們會說：「與敵距而力盡時，一死而已。」運輸戰士以死為樂事，他們所苦者，不得其死而已。</p>
<p>如前所述，此次的戰勝，與共榮圈的確立，可說有賴於海上運輸的完遂，為了勝利，為了建設樂土，不損失一兵，不沈沒貴重的軍需物資，排除敵方的猛襲而前進。登陸敵岸的馬匹，兵器，應愈多愈妙。建設共榮圈的戰士，勿使有損折，占領地域的豐富資源，國民生活的必需品，或戰鬥材料，應儘速向目的地輸送。重要的運輸任務呢，思念及此，即想死亦不願輕易就死了。</p>
<p>那就是日常的訓練，船員在萬一的塲合，對任何危險，都捨棄了自身，盡全力援救乘船部隊。</p>
<p>日本海員的打算　　因為在戰爭中，或許在深夜遭遇敵人。在萬一的塲合，如果仍如一副睡衣未脫的模樣，那是日本海員所引以為恥的。一旦出港以後，不管怎樣汗污，怎樣被風吹浪打，不能入浴。而穿了睡衣就寢，那簡直是夢想。在海員們看來，港外就是戰塲。任何時候發生了任何事情，不能不隨時準備應付</p>
<p>負重責的船長，一天二十四小時，沒有一刻不立在船橋上。不要說洗驗入浴，就是一日三餐，也在船橋上。往廁所也沒有工夫。不論畫夜，偶有餘暇時，祇在船橋上的椅子中假寐一會。</p>
<p>海洋中與敵交戰</p>
<p>對於隨時可以出現的敵潛水艦，敵飛機，必須更嚴重的警戒瞭望。大空中的一黑點，大海中的一漂流物，都不能看過。</p>
<p>那裏是冬季的北洋的海。</p>
<p>怒濤掀天，將船體如樹葉般播弄，烈風打桅，駭人的潮風吹打着面頰。濃霧彌漫，遮蔽了前途。寒風刺肌，全身浴着　濃的細雨，繼續監視着。</p>
<p>這裏是暑熱的南方的海。</p>
<p>如燃燒般灼熱的炎日下，酷毒的太陽，不容赦地照得如同炙骨。瞭望員祇是默默地立着凝視海空，心不二用地架起望遠鏡，極目四望，沒有一樣東西可逃過視綫。</p>
<p>這樣索敵警戒，不分書夜，不論睛雨，不問寒署，永遠繼續着。在運輸任務的背後，有這種人所不知的辛苦。</p>
<p>前方，白波上看見有黑點，並有一條水泡向這裏突進前來。於是立即向船橋報告，那是敵潛水艦的雷擊。</p>
<p>「右舷前方〇十度〇千米，敵的雷擊正向</p>
<p>說時遲，那時快！</p>
<p>「撥足面舵！一船長有力的號令嚴同時，全船響澈了非常警笛。</p>
<p>「戰鬥開始！」</p>
<p>接着，敵的雷擊第二發第三發相繼而來。</p>
<p>本船所備的砲已經開了火門，開始砲擊。</p>
<p>機巧妙避着魚雷時航行，假使難於避免時，則準備身殉，日本海員精神的眞面目，於此發揮無遺。</p>
<p>〇〇丸在某海上單獨航行時，前面突然有敵潛水艦浮現着。船員們即就各自的部署，並瞄準了船上的機槍，敵潛水艦開始砲擊了。我方亦開放機槍。那時候敵人除了砲擊之外再加上機槍。交戰約一小時，敵的砲彈祇有一發命中此方的船橋，其碎片擦傷了一名一等駕駛員。不過〇〇噸的該船，利其身輕，穿過敵的彈道肉迫直撞過去，敵潛水艦終於不得不潛入水中，乃向之發了四枚炸雷，其結果均不祥。</p>
<p>〇〇丸航行同海域時，發見敵潛水艦浮出的外所，立即向之砲擊，其第二彈擊毀了敵的潛望鏡。這瞎了眼的敵人正在手足無措時，我飛機立即出動追逐之目潛水艦至〇〇，終於捕獲。</p>
<p>〇〇丸完畢任務而歸基地，經〇〇海峽時，受敵潛水艦的攻擊，但因先發見敵潛水艦，故早有準備，敵人所發的幾枚魚雷，均擦肩而過，終得安歸〇〇基地，而其報吿稱：</p>
<p>「本船所最可惜者，因不備砲，故不能擊敵潛水艦。」</p>
<p>配屬於海軍部隊的機帆船，在澳洲北方水域的奮戰，亦頗可　。</p>
<p>富於積戰性而燃料經濟的此等船隻，沒有護衛，靠着極少的武器，航行於澳洲北方的海中。敵飛機向之挑戰。甲丸碇泊在法克法克時，敵機欺其可侮，飛於百米的低空，B24型被擊毀而降落，乙丸與丙丸在開克華洋而冒B25型的集中射擊而擊落之。丁丸在馬可爾附近受十次的轟炸與掃射，每次均挺直了航首向着敵機，引其下來。洛基特·哈特生型終於撞着了帆柱面跌落下來。戊丸在班泰洋面遭遇浮上的敵潛水艦，出其不意加以猛射，敵驚慌失措，潛沒遁走。有許多船雖被敵潛水艦襲擊而甲板起火者，一面從事滅火，勿使沉沒，一面苦撐着航行至目的地，卸下所載貨物，完成其目的</p>
<p>執舵輸的船長，執槍的船員，實是不遜於戰鬥員的海的猛士。</p>
<p>結語</p>
<p>如果大型船船是聯結後方與基地的　固繼路，則機帆船是基地與最前綫聯擊的紐帶。是不能被切斷的，而　能不愈益加强的。演　北面的水域需要機帆　，無此不便活動。在這裘活動的海國日本的　員，實是勇敢而可靠。。我們在這裏須牢記。船員的補給，武器的充實，亦是造成勝利的要素。（白英）</p>

<h3>賽班島殉難軍民　發揮崇高精神　日陸軍報道部發言人談話</h3>
<p>上海日陸軍報道部昨民與島同歸於盡之精神。日開例待記者，該部發略云：　人就塞　島之失陷，說關於塞班島之失陷，明其戰略上的價值，并讚日大本營已於十八日予以　日軍奮戰及孤島日木居奉直發表，帝國之決意巳在東條首相談話中闡明，在樂班島之帝國陸海軍將士及居留之日本人，其奮戰力鬥經過，在大本營陸海軍報道部長談話中，有詳細敘述，帝國守備部隊之全體殉職，已有北太平洋阿茲島，中部太平洋馬金及托拉瓦兩島之前例，但日本居民與將兵同赴古難，為大東亞解放戰而　牲，以愛祖國之熱血　於孤島，則尚以塞班島為始，賽班島陸海軍部隊之最後一兵一卒以肉體突擊敵人，當時情形在該島指揮官發至中央之報吿文中，一字一句充溢至碱，深信凡亞洲同申血統之民族，當能了解其禁高精神。</p>
<p>精神勝於一切</p>
<p>以這寒班島地位在太平洋作戰上，極為重大戰略上之價值，不能估價過低，但其價值并不絕對不變的，須視其能否充分其價值而定，因此日本此次失敗或亦可能轉禍為福，此事雖麗戰略上的問題，但精神更有其價値，此即言關於賽班島之大本營發表，對於日本國民有如何影響，這一結論乃可說明一切。當當一億日本同胞獲悉大本營發表後，態度極為鎮靜，對於最後勝利之確信絲毫不曾動搖，　以　滅美鬼，復賽班島之仇，此於過去在運戰連勝之日本人所給予的教訓，實有積極性的價值。在此非但賭一國命運，日決定火東亞解放能否成功，抑或以大東亞永遠當握於英美之魔黨奴意之大東亞戰爭過程中，局部的變化是不足為奇，大東亞戰爭之戰塲，并非限於太平洋，中國大陸戰塲亦屬同樣重要，今日軍在此重要戰塲上作戰有利進展，在渝美空軍所受損害極為　重，深信此可彌補塞班島失陷不利而有餘云。</p>

<h3>市商會何來大批米</h3>
<p>據確實消息，十七日下午三時，市商會內忽然有食米一百八十包搬八。對於這批米的來源，引起外界嚴密注意。並聞素以公正廉明孚衆望的該會監事長聞蘭亭氏，以職責所在，對此問題尤其關心。另一個消息，這批食米是由米統會十餘個職員聯合購買，而寄存於市商會的，</p>
<p>我們對於這件事，有三聲疑問：第一，米統會職員怎會恰巧聯合十數人購米一百八十包，是否化整爲零而逃避十石米以上的徵購辦法呢？第二，是否米統會職員可以購存超過三月所需量的食米呢？第三，市商會會址，是否可以供人寄存大量食米呢？</p>
<p>其次，我們更聽到米統會某重要職員的家裹，藏有六百擔食米的傳說。傳說我們姑且不談，而市商會內寄存大量食米的確息，我們希望市商會當局應有明白答復之外，同時，請問經濟保安處當局曾否聽到這消息？曾否注意到這件事？</p>

<h3>防空待避所　建造要領</h3>
<p>工廠的塲合</p>
<p>工廠常為轟炸的目標，是以待避所的必要，毋待贅述。而充分的待避訓練，亦是絕對必要的。尤以重要工廠，因工作不能不繼續到危險迫近的時候，所以不能待避於遠離的塲所，必須待避於工作塲所的附近，故必須先有充分準備與研究。</p>
<p>原則上，工廠的建築是本造時，可依一般家庭的待避要領：水泥鋼骨的建築，可依上述事務所的情形，各加以研究即可。工廠中常有一般家庭所無的設備，如地下倉庫等，均可利用為有效的待避所。且如將材料與製成品的放置略加變更，其空隙就成為很好的待避所，即使沒有這些東西，祇要伏身於傢具與機械之間，即可減輕相當損失，所以大家可先研究，萬一炸彈落下來，在咄嗟之間怎樣辦？</p>
<p>不過工廠中，如石油糟或火藥庫被破壤時，則周　有相當危賽，所以待避時須注意避免這些塲合</p>
<p>以上說明了以一般本造居歷的家庭中之待避所為中心，兼及高層建築物及工廠中待避所之建造方法，建築物的式樣，千整萬別，同樣，在何處怎樣建造待避所，恐亦千差　別。</p>
<p>要之，實際建造待避所時，應充分體會待避的精神，與適宜做待避所的地方，不抱於形式，利用既存設備，並手頭材料。假使不明自時，請接受負責者的指導。</p>
<p>最後，待淸所建造了以後，必須先詳細知道，砂囊等消防器具與用永的放廣塲所，以便立即可以從事防護活動。又與防護監視員的聯絡，出入的動作等，亦須充分訓練，以便最有效地利用待避所。</p>
<p>在沒有待避所的塲所，須時常牢記，利用附近的地物等，伏身地上的姿勢，是最簡易的待避方法。（完）</p>

<h3>實行農作報國</h3>
<p>日本靑年學生</p>
<p>現在農村，正吹着新的風。為了多產一粒五穀，專心在曠野中操作的靑年學子，都滿腔熱血，以農作報國。他們認為確保食糧非常重要，有關已本的生死存亡，尤其在今年的決戰階段上。他們純潔的奉公心，如火如茶的熱情，健康的肉體，眞摯的求知慾……在洶湧不止的汗眞裹，高興地，雄壯地迎着播弄稻田的初夏之風。今天鄉村裹的應徽勇士，看着搬運禾苗的學童羣，在東奔西走着，在自己作工的阡陌頭上，掛着帶「學生動員」字樣的一面旗幟，襲飄揚揚地深深印在心裹。</p>
<p>充滿勞動熱忱</p>
<p>「到此處來了後，大家都放心了，在學校的時候，總是不能安心……」日前宮賊縣遠由郡南鄉村曾經舉行收容典禮，其後則完全成為農村靑年的二高學生，向稻田中潛水，毫無休息地忙碌着，在他們的眉宇間，都充滿着勞動的熱忱，在他們的心靈上，都認為國家民族之安危，與自己工作的勤怠有密切關聯。</p>
<p>收容村中的優秀者，宇都宮實科高等女校的學生，都在工作地點睡，這樣勞動可以省卻往返。穿着婦女勞動服，上捲着褲腳和腕袖，在泥沼般的水田裹，業已成為滿身拖泥帶水的尚未熟練的農婦了。但這羣可愛的少年女郎們，並不疼愛自己潔白的細嫩的腿和腕，更不怕弄髒了。當問一聲「先生不在麽？」立刻就有一位女性抬起頭來說，「就是我」。這位教員也是滿身是泥，同時看着似乎比學生還年靑。不久後在休息期間，女學生們都在樹蔭下整齊地排列着坐下，喝着年靑先生輪流提來的茶。</p>
<p>秋田和山形兩縣間相近的宮城縣玉造郡鬼頭村的國民學校兒童，在距　學校有八公里餘的四季積雪的粵羽山脈荒雖岳山下，採取山菜。由可愛而又可憐的兒童手裏所採取的厥菜，業己送到帝都者，遠達一萬八千　之多。「其次就是採落榮，山葡萄。葡萄是把鹽水變成淡水的酸鹽原料。想把山中藴藏的資源使成為戰力化。」校長這樣說着，充分表示出來山中那樣太陽晒黑了的農夫。</p>
<p>福島市外的福島師範學校，向人工不足的農家租來七町田地，現在在這塊地上，甚至把附屬小學的兒童也動員來，收割麥子。該處甚至比附近的老百姓還收獲得早。可以說是熱誠的收獲。</p>
<p>收獲後全部奉獻國家，收割後的田地再加以良好的耕耘，才能奉還老百姓。學校的學生，全體都在期待收獲期時有豐富的食糧，他們自從四月以來，每天都是忍飢挨餓，喝着稀粥、在期待着收獲。</p>
<p>確保國民食糧</p>
<p>華者曾坐着東北鐵路，粵羽鐵路，信越鐡路等的火車，巡視過許多的村落，在母一塊美麗的土地上都可以看得見這樣勤勞的學生。這不僅是小小的農利想用少年的人力來幫忙，而是想備嘗各種生產的惡劣條件，以達確保一萬萬國民的食糧。這就是發揮農業報國精神，和改着經營技術。學生在農村中服務，就是注重這兩點才作的。</p>
<p>二高遠在四年前就服務的南鄉村，前此曾有很多有閑田地，但現在由於學生的勞動熱忱，只要一點茶喝而就汗流夾背的勞動，於是前此的曠野空地，都變成肥沃美田了。全村上下一致，都拚命增加生產。在種田以後，學生們遠在仙台都關心着旱和雨，常常特意跑來看看自已耕種的田園。這種情景，是如何尊敬日本皇土的農業呀！大日本帝國的農業，決非單純是農民個人營利的職業，同時也應當在內心裹深深體盼到是愛國的神聖事業。今年比往年都收獲得早，可見這種勞動精神，令人五體投地</p>
<p>山形縣南村山郡的農業學校，因為是具看筧克彦博士和加藤元治氏精神所產生的農士道場國民高等學校的後身，所以該校的學生曾動員修築金井村的貯水池堤，而都有充分的規律，默默地拼命幹下去，這種驚天地泣鬼神的熱忱，竟使農民瞠目結舌。普通人所不能作者的一定工作，而學童不到一天就完成下來，這樣就把鄉村中的懶情惡習，廓然一淸。</p>
<p>此外在經營技術的改善方面，岩平縣之類的地方，仍　守成規，因循個人主義的惡習，雖然人工不夠，而仍不願共同合作，但學生的動員，因為集體勞動，所以或許能改過去的惡習。目前農業技術落後的栃木縣，並不勵行種值，而竟自荒蕪土地，這實在是一件增加生產的障碍。學生勞動，必須按規矩種植。有一個村莊，不求學生來耕種的農家有五六家，而任意亂種。村當局便動員國民小學的學生，一天完全肅淸了荒地。（佐山記者）（安譯自六月二十人日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>各地米糧問題的檢討</h3>
<p>刷新米統會的方法</p>
<p>如前面所指出，刷新米統會的方法，並不是一部份人所主張的人事的變更。人事的刷新固有必要，但人事被機構所左右，機構被環　所左右。不以改革適應環境的機構為第一義，而僅注重區區的人事間題，毫無意義。記者會歷訪各地，上海的米統會雖然規模龐大，但各地辦事處則大多貧弱不堪，不覺為之一驚。至其工作狀況，從各方面所聞的批判，米統會本部的工作指令，不出中間機關的一步。莫怪有完全撒廢辦事處的論調了。米統會的機構，眞有一個頭幾千條尾巴之感，而且是頭重腳軋。無論到那個　事處去看，雖也做了許多圖表和統計，但那也不過將採辦商的活動極表面的加以統計化圖表化而已。眞正能夠使米統會本部確立正確方針的調查，殆不冬見。這種弱體的下層機構，不能促進至難且重大的米糧收買工作，不足為怪。米統會下部機構，並不基於各地的特殊性組織起來。例如殊州是省政府的所在地，是江蘇省農村行政的心議部，但米糧機制不是單算米統會一機關的力量可以寶施，其成否全視其與各關係機關的聯絡，提攜的程度。那麽蘇州辦事處究竟有沒有自動的促進與江蘇省政府以外重要機關的聯絡的力量呢？米統會本部應簡單地作爲計劃機關，聯絡機關，而在四五的主要集散地，應嚴立機動性的有强大　限的米統會分會。而米統會的實際工作，應由這分會負全責擔任。本部則監督分會，根據其工作而擔任全國的計劃·統制·聯絡。徵求各方而的意見，均表示完全贊成這種偏重上海主義，其他許多部門亦有同樣情形，以致產生今日極可憂慮的惡果，這是不能不特別指出的</p>
<p>例如採辦商，不依各主要產米的縣政府，縣商會，米業公會等的推薦，而根據上海報紙上的廣吿，投機米商的自薦運動所決定。</p>
<p>當指定採曰辦商時，記者曾指出，在當熟方面，大半是不良的聯營社系的投機囤積分子。不獨常熟，各地的情形亦均大同小異。</p>
<p>如松江縣，二十家指定採辦商中，僅六家向米統會借得收買資金，但因收買不力的理由而被淘汰，殘剩的十四家成續亦不佳，利用本身特權的地位，成為私運的中心。</p>
<p>同業公會不具有準備機關的性質，不過是個人的求利分子羣之便宜上的總稱而已。是以收獲後的收買希望正常，不能主張辦事處與採辦商之全面的整理。</p>
<p>在工作的初期，對於收買地區定額不公平表示不平者，就是道些採辦商。這種不平在工作的初期是難免的。然而這種不平之聲，決不是為了要收買成續良好而發的，乃是將收買成績不佳的原因使之合理化而主張的一種計策。蓋定額很公平的地區，各商號的收買成續，亦不如意料中的良好。是以收買不順利母寗求之於其他的原因，欲期公平，須先指定優秀老米商動員。</p>
<p>米統會工作的基礎</p>
<p>收買米糧的基礎，決不是更動頻繁的上層米糧械斗構，亦不是沒有中問性的各地區辦事處，成為這工作基礎的各單位機關，乃是事　以來在各地具有強力的下部機構，不受上層機構怎樣變更，對執行所負使命，盡了最大的努力。這是怎樣一種機關，此地無列舉的必要，這些機關以不變應變，在收買米糧上，盡了最大的努力。對此現實，在推進今後的工作上，應予充分注意。</p>
<p>試舉去年開始收買工作為例，各地區有原有的收買商號，也有從側面援助的機關。其經驗自事變以來所蓄積，假使能及早決定資金與價格，這些機關能立即排除萬難而取具體的行動。米統會的上部機構，下部機構與供給內地的資金，都太遲緩了。崑山辦事電成立於十一月底，待至舉行封米糧收買毫無經驗的辦事庭主任之歡迎會　，收買商號不能不坐視米糧的落市。</p>
<p>擔任米糧收買的主體，應在內地，根據這認識，今後的下部機構，似應予以改廢。</p>
<p>內地最必要的機構，不是像現存的米統會各地區辦事處，而是可稱為米糧統制協議會的各關係機州關之聯絡體。對此聯絡體，米統會為提示其方針上的必要，面設置實踐的辦事處，自無表示異議的理由。各地區國事處曾要求設立武裝檢查隊，米統會聯席會議上亦有此提議，米統會本身亦向行政院申請准予設立檢查隊。道種方針，大約都根據一切由米統會本身處理的理會。但今日無力的辦事處，究能有比其他武裝團體更佳的活動嗎？據記者所聞，南京辦事處雖設置武裝檢　隊，但其成績亦無足構。歷經各地區，今日尚聞得設置武裝檢查隊的要求，正與上海一樣，由經濟保安處檢查私運囤積，內地亦應有類似的機關擔任檢查。</p>
<p>新政策自然應該推進。然如內地人十誤解為輕牀架屋般機構的方策，應嚴予採斥。　牀架屋的機構，除了混亂以外，什麽結果也沒有。（譯自六月二十七日大陸新報）</p>

<h3>法國給我們的教訓</h3>
<p>在這次世界大戰中，法蘭西是一個命運極悲慘處境極困難的國家。一九四〇年西歐大戰展開之後，在德國的閃電攻勞之下，法國慘淡經營自認為銅牆鐵壁的馬奇諾防綫很快便被攻破，首都巴黎不久也被佔領。當其時，德軍長驅直入，勢如破竹，法國眞有亡國之危。幸而老齡老翁具當將軍眼見國家己經戰敗不能再戰，毅然挺身而出，對德簽訂停戰協定，才把法國從減亡的深淵中拯救出來。這在法國，本來是行乎其所不得不行，止乎其所不得不止，但是英美從此對於法國那就太殘酷了。他們一而支持特戈爾進行分裂法國的運動：一面直接以壓力加諸法國，不斷打擊法國，如凍結法國的資金與貿易，封鎖法國的糧食，襲擊法國的海軍，甚至掠奪法國的海外殖民地。法國始終忍氣呑聲，起初還想和英美保持友好的關係，旣知其不可能，依然極力避免對英美作正面的衝突。在法國總算極盡委曲求全之能事，並未開罪於英美。可是英美始終抱着犧牲法國侵略歐洲的野心，最近更悍然在诺曼第半島登陸，以巴黎為進攻的日標，法國國土，從此又再度淪為反軸心軍與軸心軍的戰塲。兵燹餘生瘡痍未復的法國人民從此又重　戰禍，顛沛流離於水深火熱之中，命運眞是太悲慘了。</p>
<p>我們同情法國的處境和遭遇，同時認為法國是我們一面最好的鏡子，給我們很大的教訓。我們右應該效法法國的地方，而自己不能主動的把握機會。我們可以避免陷於與法國同樣悲慘的命運，而偏偏把國家弄到這樣的境地，談起來眞要痛哭流涕。</p>
<p>法國戰敗了不能再戰，便毅然決然，對德停戰，以期挽回國家的劫運，保全國家的力量，這是法國當局公忠謀國和赤誠愛國的表現，因而法國人民也莫不諒解當局的苦心，擁護政府的政策。重慶當局也非不知戰敗了不能再戰，過去七年當中，中日兩國也不是沒有終止戰爭實現和平的機會。但是重慶當局為什麼不能拿出像貝富元帥那樣謀國的公忠和愛國的赤誠，把握機會，改變政策，以謀結束殘酷的戰爭，保全國家的元氣？為什麼偏偏要倚賴英美，乞憐英美，偏偏不能擺脫英美的操縱，拒絕英美的挑唆，甚至明知為英美所利用，被英美所按制，而亦在所不惜，引狼入室，把大好河山，拱手讓給英美帝國主義作為侵略中國制霸東亞的基地呢？重慶方面以上賓之禮來供養在華美國空軍，而他們天天破壞我們的城市，殘殺我們的同胞，攜毀我們的產業，這是如何痛心。另一方面，英美帝國主義旣欲以中國大陸為侵略東亞的基地，日本雖然不以中國為敵，但爲擊敗英美起見，也不能不採行先發制人在中國大陸作戰的戰略。中日事變，旣互七年而不能結束，從此中國大陸又成為日本對英美的主要戰塲，兵連禍結，徒苦吾民，我們中國人民的命運，豈不是比法國人民的命運還要悲慘嗎？</p>
<p>法國雖然對德停戰，但是歐洲戰爭還沒有結東，德國軍隊還控制法國的主要城市，因為這個緣故，法國當局雖然極力避免戰禍而終於不可能，這也是無可如何之事，只好歸之於命運，但是法國當局在過去四年巾，已經竭盡心力，可吿無罪於國家與國民。中國陷於這樣悲慘的命運，乃是人謀不臧的結果。因為道悲慘的命運，本來可以避免，而徧徧不知避免，不去避免，反而招致它來，覺不是人謀不臧的結果？假使重慶當局放棄抗戰政策，全面和平，早已實現，獨立自主，早己完成，根本沒有乞憐英美引狼入室的必要，英美帝國主義　然想利用中國控制中國以為侵略東亞的基地，也就無機可乘。成立之時，日本方面即鄭重聲明，中日全面和平一旦實現，日本立即撤退在華軍隊，假使當時重慶即行停止抗戰，實現全面和平，日本當然覆行撤兵的諾言，中國人民已可安居樂業，休養生息，永遠避免戰爭的慘痛。但因為全面和平沒有實現，日本遂未能撤兵，同時重慶當局沒有覺悟，不肯放棄抗戰政策，也就擺脫不了英美帝國主義的控制。加以美國在太平洋上屢受打擊，爲挽回頹勢起見，遂想利用中國大陸爲基地，以空襲日本本土，因而日本的對策，也就不得不在中國大陸上進行摧毀英美基地的作戰，因此種種原因，眼看中國將成爲法國第二，比法國遭受更悲慘的命運。過去我們沒有盡人事，以致造成今日的不行，現在如能力圖挽回劫運，還來得及，只在重慶當局一轉念之間，惟有停止抗議，實現和平，才可以把中國從英美帝國主義侵略的魔手中解放出來，才可以吧中國萬劫不復的命運中挽救過來。</p>

<p>眞人與隆夫在第二天九點鐘，出了公寓。這樣一所漂亮的房子，很高興地租給海軍大官，這也是當地的習慣。眞人公寓的老板娘，是五十歲左右的寡婦，而是繡花的能手</p>
<p>「回港的時候，總是希望享受一些家庭的快樂，所以我們才選擇那樣地方的。那一家很和睦親切，但女孩子很多……」</p>
<p>「那還不好麼？」</p>
<p>隆夫向眞人開着玩笑，自己突然笑了。</p>
<p>「不，眞討厭！」</p>
<p>眞人的聲普是非常認眞的。</p>
<p>「為什麼？」</p>
<p>「近來曾發生了一件事，正常我在洗澡，突然在洗澡間外，開始練習繡花。因爲女孩子來了很多，所以裸體是不能出去的。只好等她們練習繡花元畢，才能出洗澡間，但在洗澡聞裏被熱氣蒸發着，個中苦味眞是難以形容。我想潛永蜓在赤道上長時間潛航時，一定有這種難言的感覺。」</p>
<p>這樣面孔上稍帶羞色而說出來的話，不能不使隆夫大笑不止。今天的眞人雖然穿着軍服，而雄料糾地大步來往着，但在面孔上，却仍然表現着少年的態度。隆夫於是聯想到忘記很久的眞人綽號「蘋果」。紅暈的兩頰，與軍人組時代一樣，浮現着童貞的氣味。</p>
<p>（我不像眞人那樣純潔……）</p>
<p>隆夫不知不覺開始引自己的東京生活為恥了</p>

<p>眞人這樣解釋着，鈴蘭燈排列着一條熱鬧馬路上，沒有電車，所以並不像銀座，而像道頓堀。或許因為是星期天，而有許多水兵和下士官在馬路上來往着。一看眞人，舉着帶紅臂章的手，在一一地實行還禮。</p>
<p>走到十字路口時，眞人說：</p>
<p>「吳鎮這樣糟的城市，並沒有觀賞的地方。那是鎭守府，這上面是水交社，但還是先到潛水學校去吧！」</p>
<p>「我也是這樣想。」</p>
<p>恰好停在前面有一輛出差汽車，眞人搭話呌來。</p>
<p>上了車，眞人就说：</p>

        <h1>1944.07.20</h1>
<h3>Before the Merger of Municipal Organs</h3>
<p>Our municipal government will formally merge starting from August 1st. Originally, after the acceptance of the concessions last year, in order to adapt to the environment, the original concession areas were inherited and divided into districts. Now that a year has passed, in order to achieve true administrative unity, consolidation from a distance is necessary.</p>
<p>According to general observation, there are currently two main views regarding the merger of municipal organs. One view advocates a thorough and comprehensive reform, while the other advocates a conservative maintenance of the status quo. However, we must recognize the serious environment Shanghai is currently in, which requires comprehensive reform to maintain the status quo. We have repeatedly pointed out the severity of Shanghai's current position and surrounding environment. If we do not actively eliminate the crisis, the severity will only increase. Therefore, those who advocate conservatism are merely sitting idly by as the serious nature increases and are insufficient to maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>In our editorial "The First Lesson in Reforming Shanghai" on March 13th of this year, we said: Shanghai, both in the past and present, can be said to be the center of the nation's economy, culture, and education. In terms of political importance, it is second only to the capital and surpasses all other regions in the country. Since the Greater East Asia War, Shanghai has become one of the most important rear bases. Therefore, from the perspective of China as a whole or the Greater East Asia region, Shanghai occupies an extremely important position. In other words, all of Shanghai's actions have a significant impact on various parts of China and the Greater East Asia region. We can assert that if Shanghai can be reformed, it can influence and promote the reform of the entire China and can truly coordinate to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Therefore, we recognize that reform in Shanghai is necessary, and it must be a thorough and comprehensive reform. The consolidation of municipal organs should be seen as a preparation for comprehensive reform. Before the consolidation of municipal organs, two issues are particularly worth emphasizing: The first is the issue of public security. Shanghai occupies the position of an important rear base in the Greater East Asia decisive battle. The preconditions for exerting all its strength are internal efforts on the one hand and external security on the other. The so-called external security is to ensure public safety and maintain order. The second is the financial issue. Finance is the lifeline of all administration. All civil servants, in order to improve service efficiency and fulfill the responsibility of reform, must have stable compensation. Secondly, political facilities and the implementation of various new policies all require realistic funding. Therefore, finances must be transparent, tax collection must be organized, and the revenue and expenditure of municipal organs must not be independent but must be centrally collected and disbursed, and be certain.</p>
<p>In addition, we hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to the following matters before the merger:</p>
<p>For all the excellent systems of the former Public Concession, those worth adopting should be retained and adopted, without abandoning them because of the people involved. Outstanding technical talents and long-serving staff should be fully retained if they continue to serve.</p>
<p>Service regulations for public servants should be promptly redrafted and unified. At the same time, all guarantees that public servants should receive, as well as reward and punishment measures, should be specified in detail to ensure peace of mind in service.</p>
<p>The selection of cadres for the municipal government and various bureaus and departments is very important. Standards should be established, and personnel should be re-evaluated, focusing on talent, so that the personnel will be refreshed at the time of the merger. The original "Personnel Committee" of the First District Public Office should be used as a model. We hope that the municipal government, before the merger of municipal organs, should establish a "Personnel Committee" to seriously assess personnel selection, absolutely adopting a talent-based approach, ensuring that redundant personnel do not get a foothold, and improving administrative efficiency.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the municipal authorities will establish a most complete administrative system and then match it with sound personnel. Without a perfect system, personnel will not be sound. However, even with a perfect system, without sound personnel, the advantages of the system will not be realized. Therefore, a perfect system and sound personnel must be given equal importance and should not be neglected. We hope that Shanghai will become a model area for national politics. This merger is the most appropriate opportunity for reform. May the authorities seize the opportunity in time.</p>
<h3>Adapting to the Current Stage of the War and Enhancing Ship Transportation Capacity: Naval Attache Kondo Talks About the Nearness of Navy Day</h3>
<p>Naval Attache Kondo of the Allied Shanghai Navy delivered a speech on Navy Day, entitled "The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War and the Importance of Ship Transportation Capacity." The following is a record:</p>
<p>Both combat and supply are equally important in war, and the two have a close and inseparable relationship. Sufficient supply is a necessary condition for victory. As the saying goes, "It is difficult to fight on an empty stomach." This shows the importance of supply in war. Recalling the past when the minister Toyotomi Hideyoshi征伐attacked 朝解Korea, the result was an anticlimactic ending, which was due to a lack of supplies. Supply in war, broadly interpreted, includes the development of resources, the transportation of raw materials, the production of war necessities, and the transportation of products to the battlefield, and other aspects. Among them, in terms of transportation, there are sea transportation, land transportation, and air transportation. The main battlefield of this Greater East Asia War is in the Pacific Ocean, and the area is thousands of miles of sea. Therefore, the issue of ship transportation is the most important matter of supply, needless to say. Therefore, this war is said to be a war of ship transportation capacity. The issue of ship transportation capacity is not only the transportation of raw materials, weapons, ammunition, and food. In this Pacific operation, combat transportation is actually a part of the battle and has extremely important tasks. It is not difficult to imagine. Maintaining and enhancing ship transportation capacity and enhancing air combat power are the keys to Japan's victory. The enemy is also eagerly trying to reduce Japan's ship transportation capacity through various strategies. This is evident from the activities of enemy aircraft. Therefore, we must mobilize all efforts and overcome all difficulties to devote all our efforts to maintaining and increasing ship transportation capacity.</p>
<p>Ships and Sailors Must Be Excellent</p>
<p>Ship transportation capacity mainly involves the issue of ships and sailors. It is necessary to transport a large number of excellent ships to the battlefield. Moreover, we need skilled sailors who are constantly on alert day and night in the presence of enemy submarines and aircraft. It is not easy to ensure safe navigation. Usually, they must fight against wind and waves, and heat and cold. In wartime, they must fight against time due to operational requirements. Therefore, they must overcome these dangers and difficulties, and act without delay. This kind of hardship is no different from that of the soldiers on the front lines of the army and navy. Sailors must shoulder the same mission as the army and navy, which is their duty. Enhancing ship transportation capacity is also related to those living on land, and there are many points that should be cooperated with. The first is to increase the efficiency of cargo transportation. If something that can be done in two days is delayed to three or four days, it is the same as reducing the ship's capacity by tens of thousands of tons. This is clear. It is also necessary to reduce the repair period of ships as much as possible. Sailors fight against all difficulties and dangers at sea before safely entering the port. Therefore, during the ship's brief port stay, it is necessary to reduce the burden on the sailors as much as possible, so that they can have sufficient rest and be eager to move forward for the mission. This is the natural task of those stationed on land. Second, we should thoroughly restrict the transportation of non-urgent goods and travel. If anyone takes advantage of their position and status to delay travelers with urgent matters, or occupies valuable ship space with non-urgent items, this will hinder the progress of the war and should be strictly rectified. Third, those with experience in maritime service must recognize the current situation and the importance of maintaining and enhancing ship transportation capacity. They must be prepared for any assignment and remember that the absence of a single sailor can reduce ship transportation capacity. Moreover, fathers and brothers should recognize that ship transportation capacity and army-navy cooperation are extremely important tasks for the progress of the war and hope that they will actively cooperate and send their outstanding children to the navy.</p>
<p>More Necessary in the Decisive Battle Stage</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, the activities of sailors in the Japanese shipping fleet have been very remarkable. Not to mention the cold, heat, wind, and waves, they have fought against enemy aircraft and mines and resolutely carried out their missions. This is very admirable. There are countless touching stories of patriotism. Their enthusiasm is commendable. Now that the Greater East Asia War is entering the decisive battle stage, enhancing ship transportation capacity is absolutely necessary. Young men with patriotic enthusiasm should silently carry out this extremely important task, participate in the Japanese shipping fleet, and contribute to the increase of ship transportation capacity. Those living on land, even in the midst of heat, wind, and rain, should be touched by the enthusiasm of the brave ship transportation soldiers who are still fighting against all dangers and difficulties. At the same time, it is hoped that they will devote all their efforts to their respective positions and advance towards the completion of the war. On the occasion of the Navy Day of the year 44, I would like to offer a few words to express my views.</p>

<h3>Account of Decisive Battle on Saipan Island: Japanese Army Held Toast to Mutual Celebration of Heroic Deeds Before General Offensive, Then Jointly Breached Enemy Lines and All Died for Their Country</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army garrison on Saipan Island launched a general offensive against the enemy forces with raging momentum on July 7th. After summing up reports from various sources and other news, it is known that the circumstances of the Japanese army's complete death in battle at the final moment of the battle were as follows: Before the general attack, the supreme commander and all the officers and soldiers jointly raised their glasses to celebrate each other's heroic deeds, shouted "Banzai," prayed for the boundless prosperity of the country, and expressed their deep gratitude for the great assistance of friendly forces. All the soldiers jointly broke into the enemy lines. Three thousand seriously wounded and sick soldiers committed suicide. Those who could move carried weapons, and those without weapons initially held bamboo spears or other handguns, charging towards the enemy lines with the courage of one against ten. The Japanese army garrison made a final general attack on July 7th. After this battle, the remaining Japanese army continued to wage guerrilla warfare in various places, relying on ditches or other positions, with a small number of soldiers engaging in extremely strong activities. The enemy forces were deeply disturbed by this. Until the last moment, they bravely died for their country.</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Army Garrison, Talk by Japanese Army and Navy Press Directors</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency) Regarding the course of the battle on Saipan Island and the fact that the entire garrison of the island died heroically, the Japanese Army and Navy Press Directors jointly issued a statement as follows: In early June, enemy American powerful mobile units appeared in the east of the Mariana Islands. Initially, 190 carrier-based aircraft bombed Saipan Island. On the 12th, 230 aircraft attacked the island again. On the 14th, the area near the Oleai airfield on the southwest coast of the island was shelled by enemy American forces. Enemy Americans, with a naval force of more than ten aircraft carriers, eight battleships, and about seventy large transport ships as the base, landed soldiers to engage in battle. Starting in the morning of the 15th, they bombarded fiercely. At about 7:00 a.m., enemy troops, under the cover of more than 300 boats, attempted to land near Oleai on the southwest coast of the island. After fierce interception by the Japanese army garrison, they were defeated and retreated. The enemy suffered great losses. In the afternoon of the same day, a part of the enemy army occupied the area near Cape Susupe. Afterwards, it gradually expanded. The Japanese army units in this area continued to counterattack under the fierce artillery fire of the enemy army. By the evening, in the melee alone, they had destroyed more than ten enemy tanks. The intensity of the battle can be imagined.</p>
<p>All Water Sources Destroyed</p>
<p>The Japanese Air Force sank one enemy battleship and one cruiser each, and destroyed two cruisers in total. The Japanese Army artillery also sank or destroyed a large number of enemy boats full of soldiers. The enemy army, relying on its overwhelming military strength, disregarded all sacrifices and forcibly landed with a division of troops. On the 16th, due to the fierce attack by the Japanese army, the enemy army made no progress. On the same day and night, the Japanese army launched night attacks from the east and north, and a part of the army broke into Cape Susupe, dividing the enemy into north and south, causing chaos. At dawn on the 17th, the Japanese army had to retreat again due to the fierce bombardment by the enemy army. After that, under the airstrikes and bombardments from various sides of the enemy army, the damage to the Japanese army increased day by day. On the 19th, the Japanese army simultaneously lost the street of Garapan City and the positions in the center of the bay, as well as Oleai Airport and Aslito Airport. On the other hand, a part of the Japanese fleet immediately began to move to meet the enemy fleet. The enemy American South Pacific Fleet also went north to meet the battle. A fierce encounter battle occurred in the waters west of the Mariana Islands on the 19th and 20th. The details will be announced by the headquarters. As such, until 12:00 p.m. on the 23rd, all the water sources on Saipan Island were destroyed. The island was originally a place to obtain water sources, which caused the water use to fall into a difficult state. Furthermore, the shelling and bombing by those who controlled the sea continued day after day, and finally exerted their fierce power over the entire island.</p>
<p>Non-Stop Fierce Battle with the Enemy</p>
<p>The Japanese army fought fiercely with the enemy non-stop for more than ten days, and the damage gradually increased. The enemy's ship searchlight illumination and nighttime attacks with flares made it difficult for the troops to move. On the 25th, the enemy troops, holding tanks, advanced from the Garapan City street to the south of Mt. Tapochau, reaching the Laulau area. At this time, the battle line gradually became intertwined. In such a fierce battle, the Japanese army did not flinch at all and all rushed into the enemy's positions with bombs, making the enemy tremble with fear. On the evening of the 26th, Mt. Tapochau was finally captured. The high ground was the highest point on Saipan Island. The enemy army immediately moved artillery from the south side of the high ground, and the battle situation suddenly deteriorated for our army. On the 28th, the enemy's attack became even more fierce, almost all of the Japanese army's artillery was destroyed, and almost all of the artillery shells were exhausted. However, they still fought bravely. A part of the Japanese army units, in the enemy's encirclement, was still able to maintain the strongholds on the south side and southeast of Mt. Tapochau, preventing the enemy's northward advance. As the battle situation grew urgent, the Otsu platoon quickly attacked the enemy's camp, which had five or six light mortars and seven or eight groups of illumination shells. When they received the order to return, they broke through several lines of enemy positions with only fifteen soldiers remaining, annihilated 150 soldiers, and destroyed the enemy headquarters before returning to the battalion. Similar courageous actions were seen everywhere. Since June 21, the Japanese air force and naval units have bombed the enemy positions, material collection points, and airfields to aid the ground battle and benefit our army, turning everything into ashes. On the one hand, they attacked the enemy boats around Saipan Island, sinking two aircraft carriers, one transport ship, destroying one cruiser, and one ship of unknown type. They also destroyed more than 30 enemy positions.</p>
<p>Remarkable War Results Achieved by the Japanese Army</p>
<p>Since June 11, when the enemy mobile units attacked the Mariana Islands, the results of the battles achieved by the Japanese air force and naval units are as follows: Sunk two aircraft carriers, three battleships, four cruisers, three destroyers, one submarine, and two ships of unknown type. Sunk and destroyed more than five aircraft carriers and one battleship. Destroyed more than five aircraft carriers and one battleship. Destroyed five or six aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, three destroyers, one ship of unknown type, and seven transport ships. Shot down more than 863 aircraft. It is regrettable that we were unable to make the enemy abandon their intention. The Japanese army combat units were commended by His Majesty the Emperor on June 17, and on June 30, they were honored with a gift, which boosted the morale of the soldiers. Out of gratitude, they vowed to annihilate the enemy army and fight to the last soldier. However, after a hard battle of two months, the Japanese army was almost completely exhausted, and the enemy's artillery fire became more and more intense. The enemy's ground forces had reached a strength of three divisions, and they repeatedly took the opportunity to break into the Japanese army's positions. On July 4, the Japanese army's battle line was forced to retreat from Mt. Inabak (221) in the northeastern part of Saipan Island to the Tachotao line. There was not a single artillery piece that could cope with the enemy's artillery fire, and weapons were extremely scarce. They only used hand-to-hand combat to stop the enemy's attack. On the 5th, they retreated further to the area near Mt. Marpi at the northernmost tip. At this time, about 3,000 Japanese soldiers were wounded. The 37th Engineer Regiment automatically burned important documents. On the night of the same day, they received the final attack order, and all attacked the enemy's positions. According to this order, they immediately formed about 50 groups of troops and penetrated deep into the enemy's positions, searching for the enemy's headquarters, encampments, bomb artillery, etc., and destroying them, causing internal chaos.</p>
<p>Last All-Out Heroic Attack</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th, they launched a final heroic attack on the enemy's landing point near Garankanonsi. On the same day, the Japanese army, navy, and air force all continued to fight under the command of Vice Admiral Nagumo, the supreme commander of the navy in that area, Lieutenant General Saito, the commander of the army units, and Rear Admiral Shimasaki, the commander of the naval units. The entire army died in battle. The Japanese air force had learned of this heroic battle situation through observation. In particular, the Japanese residents in the area have been cooperating in the battle from beginning to end, as announced by the headquarters. This kind of sincerity for the country is enough to move heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods weep. The battle of Saipan Island was considered by the enemy American forces to be the most difficult and fierce battle in the Pacific War. According to their announcement, the damage before July 10 reached more than 15,000 people. The elimination of this number was unexpected. The numbers announced are already very objective. In addition, when issuing the order to launch an attack after the battle, the current commander reported as follows: "I have failed to fulfill His Majesty the Emperor's sacred charge and have not been able to make adequate contributions. The Ootsu platoon has demonstrated the essence of the Imperial Army's bravery and courage. There are too many stories to tell. At present, the soldiers are dying in their proper place, and I am convinced that the Imperial country will be victorious and the national fortune will be limitless. I respectfully convey this." The Japanese people will certainly be confident that the entire country will be victorious and will repay the soldiers who have sacrificed themselves for the great cause. At this time when the arrogant enemy is about to advance on the mainland, they will certainly display the traditional spirit of the Imperial Army and annihilate the enemy.</p>

<h3>The Japanese South China Expeditionary Army to Launch Annihilation Campaign; Yu Army Defeated and Retreats from Northeast of Conghua</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base on the South China front, 19th: Since June 27th, the elite units of the Japanese army in South China have begun attacking the 7th War Zone of Chongqing. Currently, they are launching skillful annihilation campaigns everywhere, plunging the Yu army into a state of complete chaos. The main force of the Japanese army advancing northward from the northwest of Beijiang has already secured the solid position on the high ground south of Lianjiang, the first line of defense for Shaoguan in the 7th War Zone, and is preparing to attack Yingde and then press on to Shaoguan. A certain unit of the Japanese army is pursuing the 159th Division of the Yu army, forcing them to the area south of Lianjiang, and is currently launching an encirclement and annihilation campaign. Another powerful unit is also pursuing and annihilating the 156th Division of the Yu army, which is fleeing from the northwest of Guangzhou. From midnight on the 12th to 12:00 noon on the 13th, a regiment of the 152nd Division of the Yu army in the Wan area northeast of Conghua was completely surrounded and annihilated, leaving behind hundreds of corpses and many prisoners. The Japanese army also captured a large quantity of mortars, light machine guns, rifles, ammunition, etc., inflicting a heavy blow on the Yu army. According to Yu Hanmou, commander of the 7th War Zone of Chongqing, he has consistently attempted to defend Shaoguan to the death, frequently supervising the battle and repeatedly sending reinforcements in an attempt to hold on. He has also continuously sent reinforcements from Shaoguan to the 154th Division and the Independent 9th Brigade of the Yu army on the north bank of the Lianjiang, attempting to defend the second line of defense north of the Lianjiang. Currently, the troops of the Yu army moving towards the northern area of Conghua include the 187th Division on the east bank of the Beijiang, the 153rd Division, which was severely attacked by the Japanese army's flanking units at the beginning of this month, and the 152nd Division of the enemy, which is already in a state of collapse. Therefore, a large-scale annihilation campaign in the mountainous area north of the Beijiang is about to begin.</p>
<p>Enemy American Planes</p>
<p>Harassing the Rear Central News Agency dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese army on the Chinese front, 19th: The fierce offensive of the Japanese air force has caused the American air force stationed in Chongqing to retreat step by step. They are now actively preparing for replenishment work. Observing the recent activities of the American planes, it is known that their tactics have changed. In the past year, they mostly used combined formations of fighters and bombers, which were dispatched during the day. Since the spring, especially after the Japanese air force began its offensive, their bombers have not been dispatched during the day, and only a small number of fighters carrying small bombs have been sent to the battlefield to fight. When using bombers, they mostly choose nighttime, and their goal is to harass the rear. The reason for the enemy planes' change of tactics is nothing more than an attempt to reduce damage, which is further proof of their mental terror. The enemy army is still launching attacks from the mainland with large combined groups of fighters and bombers, but because they fear being discovered by the elite Japanese fighter planes, they have no choice but to find ways to escape, to the point that they dare not continue to attack their target. Therefore, the Japanese air force will further launch a triumphant pursuit war in the skies over the mainland, in order to annihilate the enemy planes before they move, it is said.</p>

<h3>Japan Decides to Fully Develop Domestic Chromium Mines</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 19th: The Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Munitions, in view of the urgent need for chromium ore, an important raw material for ordinary steel and special steel, in order to establish a permanent and reliable system, will improve the reliance on overseas imports starting from July, August, and September this year, and has decided to fully develop domestic chromium mines. Currently, the main chromium mines in Japan are located in Hokkaido and the Chugoku region. Due to delays in mining, production in Hokkaido is relatively low. The ore quality in the Chugoku region is excellent, and production is also good. Specific plans for emergency production increase in both regions are currently being studied jointly by the Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, the Mining Control Association, and the Ore Allocation Control Company. Production in Hokkaido can be increased by strengthening labor, materials, and transportation. The Chugoku region will also see a rapid increase in production due to the availability of production factors. Therefore, it is urgent for the domestic chromium ore industry in Japan to quickly obtain an increased production system in order to meet the growing needs. Therefore, there are high expectations for the developers' insights, management innovation, and production advancement.</p>

When a breakthrough gap was formed in this unit, cavalry was used as a follow-up. Initially, the Soviet army swept through the German lines and advanced several kilometers to the southwest, but at this point, the German army flanked the enemy from both the north and south, preventing the Soviet offensive. The Soviet army in the Grodno area had built several bridgeheads on the west bank of the Neman River on Monday morning, but German mechanized and tank units drove the Soviet army back to the east bank of the river, and then used continuous artillery fire to attack them, inflicting heavy damage. North of Grodno, fierce fighting was triggered by the German army's desire to eliminate several Soviet bridgeheads. The fighting continued fiercely all night on Monday, and became even more intense yesterday morning. East and southeast of Grodno, the German army achieved complete success in its defensive battles on Monday.

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: The German High Command in Western Europe announced on the 18th that the battle for the ruins of St. Lo is reaching its climax. The American army is gradually advancing from the northeast, west, and south.

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 19th: German News Agency reports: In the past two days, the Normandy defensive war in the Caen and St. Lo areas seems to have spread to the east of the Orne River during the operations on Tuesday. The British artillery fire, which has been active in the past 48 hours, has been converted into covering fire since the morning of the 18th. At the same time, the British army began operations with hundreds of short-range bombers and main force planes, the purpose of which was clearly to break through the German defenses. The aim of the British High Command seems to be to carry out a pincer movement on the German positions in the Caen area from the south, west, and east towards the south of the Orne River and Caen. There is no news about the British tanks and infantry attacking the east bank of the mouth of the Orne River. On Monday, the British army, with newly arrived tank troops and infantry divisions, continuously pressed against the German lines in the Martot and Faltes areas under the cover of artillery fire, but ultimately failed to achieve a decisive breakthrough. The two places of Cintheaux and Noyers, which were repeatedly gained and lost in the past two days, were finally retaken by the German army on the morning of the 18th. The focus of the American army's combat zone is in the St. Lo area, where the troops are retreating to the vicinity of the city to avoid unnecessary losses and save the German army's decisive battle strength. Currently, the German lines are northeast and north of St. Lo, about one kilometer from the suburbs, while the lines in the west are even further from the city. The mountainous positions held by the German army remain unmoved under the strong attacks of the American army.</p>
<h3>Resolved to Participate in the War and Assist the Allied Nations in Striving for Final Victory; Minister Lin Announces Remarks on the Battle of Saipan</h3>

Even the Japanese residents on the island perished with the positions. This spirit of heroic sacrifice is the greatest expression of loyalty to the country by the Japanese military and civilians. It can also be said that it represents the supreme glory won by the East Asian nation in the history of war. It is absolutely not something that can be compared with the gains and losses of one island or one place. This is something that should be shown with infinite respect. Undoubtedly, at this time, Chongqing and Washington will definitely make grand pronouncements. On the 7th of this month, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek had already used the Battle of Saipan to cover up his disastrous defeat on the Pinghan and Yuehan lines. Even he could not help but admit the severity of the situation. He could only understatedly say that this disastrous defeat was fortunate not to have occurred five years ago, but five years later. The suffering in his heart can be imagined. The Chongqing side is using the battle on Saipan to promote it, but it is just beating gongs and drums for others to cover up their own inner suffering.</p>
<p>The American Navy Mobilizes Its Troops and Attacks from Afar</p>
<p>What about Washington? The demonic hand of war will inevitably use this battle to stir up the American people, so that the American people, who have long been suffering under the war, will once again be subjected to crazy stimulation. However, there must be some military experts in the American Navy who understand the strategic advantages and disadvantages, and foresee the difficult and dangerous future. Watching this crazy propaganda, they will not only laugh it off, but will simply be disheartened.</p>
<p>Why is that? This time, Japan's war against the United States in the Pacific, in the terminology of modern warfare, can be said to be a war with limited objectives against a war with 'unlimited objectives.' In the terminology of our ancient warfare, it can be said to be a war of 'waiting for the exhausted enemy,' which is determined by the strategic situation and the power that manpower can change. The so-called war with limited objectives against a war with unlimited objectives means that after the Allied Nations, Japan, in the first stage, seized the American bases in the Pacific with the most rapid action and the most economical force, they immediately counterattacked and defended, waiting for the United States to mobilize its troops and attack from afar. Now the United States is committing a major taboo of mobilizing its troops and attacking from afar in the art of war. The gains and losses of these places have long been within the strategic calculations of the Allied Nations and are not surprising.</p>
<p>Japan Gains an Advantage in the War</p>
<p>On the American side, if it wants to counterattack Japan, it must first establish a naval base in the Pacific, not to mention victory, but at least to avoid defeat. On the one hand, it must keep the enemy within the operating range of its fleet, which cannot exceed a radius of three thousand miles. On the other hand, the supply and escort of the rear must be absolutely safe. According to this calculation, there are only three routes for the United States to counterattack Japan. The one it is currently taking is exactly what military experts call the most dangerous and difficult route. The situation on Saipan absolutely cannot be a base, as everyone knows. How can a base be established? Can a base be established? It all depends on whether the American attack force still has the ability to attack from afar after becoming more exhausted. This is not to say whether the United States wants to, but whether the United States can, which means that it all depends on whether the American army can withstand more heavy losses and more dangerous bleeding wars. In any case, after Japan has gained an advantage in the first stage of the war with limited objectives, if the United States thinks that it has succeeded in one place in the second stage of the war with unlimited objectives and forgets the major taboo of attacking from afar, that is not just madness, it is simply stupidity. The so-called waiting for the exhausted enemy means keeping one's main force in the most solid line of defense. In the shortest distance of combat, when the enemy attacks the farthest and most exhausted, seize the most advantageous opportunity to give the enemy the final and complete fatal blow. Up to now, everyone knows that the United States has exhausted all its strength to carry out this counterattack with unlimited objectives. In fact, the main war has not yet begun, and the outcome of the final victory or defeat can be decided without divination. Short-sighted people often say why Japan has not yet used its main force to intercept the enemy? People who say this neither understand the law of waiting for the exhausted enemy, nor do they understand the tactics of naval attack and defense. Naval operations are not for war's sake, but completely based on the goals of attack and defense in the war. The victory or defeat of a single battle is insignificant. This is the fundamental difference between naval warfare and land warfare. The people in Chongqing may not understand this point, but at least some people on the American side should know it.</p>
<p>Strive for Glory for Greater East Asia</p>
<p>There is another point: The power of naval operations includes three elements: one is the fleet, one is the base, and one is manpower. The so-called fleet is not only the quantity or quality of warships, but also the power that these warships can exert in their operations. This means that it is not only its static power, but most importantly, its dynamic power. The distance of combat and the supply of provisions are very important to this dynamic power. In this regard, Japan has a great advantage. The so-called base is not only a piece of land, but how the terrain of this piece of land is, what the environment is like, and especially how far it is from the mainland, must be calculated clearly. In this regard, Japan also has an absolute advantage. The so-called manpower is not only in the number of people, but also in the morale of the people. We look at the heroic sacrifice of the Allied troops on Attu Island, look at the heroic sacrifice of the Allied troops and residents on Saipan this time, and then think of the time when the so-called well-equipped and well-fed 60,000 troops of Yang Guo were defeated miserably after a single battle, and they still said that they were lucky not to have a casualty. Why were there no casualties? Because they were defeated in one battle and surrendered as soon as they were defeated. The 60,000 well-equipped and well-fed troops have become voluntarily surrendered prisoners. In contrast, the morale of the Japanese and American military and civilians can be said to be worlds apart. Looking at it this way, even if Roosevelt has the heart to mobilize his troops and attack from afar, I really don't know where the United States can go from afar? And how long can it work? Furthermore, I don't know what the parents, wives, and children of these soldiers think when they think of the fate of their sons or husbands in the face of these crazy propaganda in recent days?</p>
<p>The morale of the Japanese military and civilians is innate to the Japanese nation and cultivated later. This morale has already won glory for the East Asian nation in the first great war against foreign countries. In this Greater East Asia War, it is even more demonstrated everywhere. The certainty of a decisive victory is established on the above. What's more, the strategic advantages are also available. In addition to gratitude and shame for the Allied military and civilians fighting bravely, we can only maintain our determination to participate in the war and redouble our efforts. On the one hand, we must mobilize manpower and resources to assist the Allied Nations in striving for final victory. On the other hand, we must use the final expectation to promote the awakening of Chongqing, so that the beautiful mountains and rivers will no longer be used by Britain and the United States as their battlefields for their sacrifices."</p>
<h3>The Seafaring Spirit of Maritime Japan</h3>
<p>The Mission of Ships and Seamen</p>
<p>What distinguishes this war from previous wars is that it begins with surprise attacks across the ocean and landings ahead of the enemy, with both the army and navy relying on transoceanic operations from start to finish. Therefore, the paramount importance of completing maritime transport in the war effort goes without saying. In this vital task for the nation, ships and sailors are currently demonstrating their full capabilities and continuing to play an active role.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, our sailors have relentlessly followed the transport fleets behind the brave Japanese soldiers, fighting tirelessly. They bravely face the enemy's fierce aerial bombardment and artillery fire, assisting in landings ahead of the enemy, and navigate the perilous waters teeming with enemy submarines, fulfilling their transport duties. Our sailors are filled with fighting spirit, declaring, "Come what may! What is there to fear!" "Let's go!" "Let's fight!"</p>
<p>They nonchalantly set sail for dangerous seas.</p>
<p>Bloody Rigorous Training</p>
<p>Even trains running on tracks must struggle on snowy nights. How much more so on the vast, boundless ocean, where dense fog, snowstorms, and hurricanes constantly strike, and enemy aircraft and submarines approach one after another from overhead and alongside. Convoys advancing under strict blackout conditions endure unimaginable hardships day and night. Enduring these hardships and overcoming these dangers, Japanese sailors cultivate a spirit of heroic determination. They undergo bloody rigorous training. Once they set sail, they disregard their own lives. Transport warriors say, "When we are exhausted fighting the enemy, death is the only option." Transport warriors find joy in dying; their only regret is not being able to die for the cause.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the victory in this war and the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere depend on the completion of maritime transport. For the sake of victory and building a paradise, we must not lose a single soldier or sink valuable military supplies. We must advance, overcoming the enemy's fierce attacks. The more horses and weapons that land on enemy shores, the better. We must not allow any harm to come to the warriors building the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The abundant resources of the occupied territories, the necessities of life for the people, and combat materials must be transported to their destinations as quickly as possible. Considering the importance of the transport mission, they would not want to die easily, even if they thought of death.</p>
<p>That is why daily training is essential. In case of emergency, sailors will abandon themselves and do everything possible to rescue the troops on board.</p>
<p>The Resolve of Japanese Sailors: In wartime, they may encounter the enemy at night. In such a case, it would be shameful for Japanese sailors to be caught still in their pajamas. Once they leave port, no matter how sweaty or battered by wind and waves, they cannot bathe. Sleeping in pajamas is simply unthinkable. In the eyes of sailors, the sea beyond the harbor is the battlefield. They must be prepared at all times for anything that may happen.</p>
<p>The captain, bearing heavy responsibility, stands on the bridge twenty-four hours a day. He doesn't even have time to wash or bathe; he takes his three meals on the bridge. He doesn't even have time to go to the restroom. Day and night, when he has a moment to spare, he simply catnaps on a chair on the bridge.</p>
<p>Engaging the Enemy in the Ocean</p>
<p>They must be even more vigilant in watching out for enemy submarines and aircraft that may appear at any time. They cannot overlook a single black speck in the sky or a piece of floating debris in the sea.</p>
<p>There is the northern sea in winter.</p>
<p>Raging waves toss the ship like a leaf. Fierce winds lash the mast, and horrifying tides buffet the face. Dense fog shrouds the way forward. Icy winds sting the skin, and the whole body is soaked in heavy drizzle as they continue to monitor the surroundings.</p>
<p>Here is the southern sea in the heat of summer.</p>
<p>Under the scorching sun, the relentless heat burns like it's roasting bones. The lookout silently stands and gazes at the sea and sky, single-mindedly raising his binoculars and scanning the horizon, ensuring that nothing escapes his sight.</p>
<p>This kind of enemy search and vigilance continues day and night, rain or shine, summer or winter, forever. Behind the transport mission lies this kind of hardship unknown to others.</p>
<p>Ahead, a black dot is seen on the white waves, and a trail of bubbles is rushing toward them. They immediately report to the bridge that it is a torpedo attack from an enemy submarine.</p>
<p>"Right ahead, ten degrees, zero kilometers, an enemy torpedo is heading towards…"</p>
<p>No sooner said than done!</p>
<p>"Hard a starboard!" The captain's powerful command rings out, and at the same time, the emergency alarm blares throughout the ship.</p>
<p>"Battle stations!"</p>
<p>Then, the enemy's second and third torpedoes come in quick succession.</p>
<p>The ship's guns have already opened fire, beginning the bombardment.</p>
<p>Skillfully avoiding torpedoes while navigating, and preparing to die for the cause if avoidance is impossible, the true spirit of the Japanese sailor is fully demonstrated here.</p>
<p>While the 〇〇 Maru was sailing alone in a certain sea, an enemy submarine suddenly surfaced in front of it. The crew immediately went to their respective posts and aimed the ship's machine guns. The enemy submarine began shelling. The ship also opened fire with machine guns. At that time, the enemy added machine-gun fire to their shelling. After about an hour of engagement, only one enemy shell hit the ship's bridge, and a fragment grazed the cheek of a first-class officer. However, the 〇〇-ton ship, taking advantage of its light weight, weaved through the enemy's trajectories and rammed straight into the enemy submarine, which finally had to submerge. The ship then fired four depth charges at it, but the results were unknown.</p>
<p>While the 〇〇 Maru was sailing in the same waters, it spotted an enemy submarine surfacing and immediately opened fire. The second shot destroyed the enemy's periscope. As the blinded enemy was panicking, the ship's aircraft immediately took off to chase the submarine to 〇〇, finally capturing it.</p>
<p>The 〇〇 Maru completed its mission and was returning to base, when it was attacked by an enemy submarine while passing through the 〇〇 Strait. However, because the enemy submarine was spotted first, the ship was prepared. The several torpedoes fired by the enemy passed close by, and the ship was able to return safely to the 〇〇 base. The report stated:</p>
<p>"The ship's greatest regret is that it was not equipped with guns, so it could not destroy the enemy submarine."</p>
<p>The heroic battles of the motorized sailing ships assigned to the naval forces in the waters north of Australia are also quite commendable.</p>
<p>These ships, with their accumulated combat experience and fuel efficiency, sail the waters north of Australia without escorts and with minimal weaponry. Enemy aircraft challenge them. When the Jia Maru was anchored in Fakfak, enemy aircraft, presuming it was an easy target, flew at a low altitude of 100 meters. The B-24 was shot down and crashed. The Yi Maru and Bing Maru, while navigating the waters of Kekwa, braved the concentrated fire of B-25s and shot them down. The Ding Maru, near Makal, was subjected to ten bombing and strafing attacks. Each time, it held its course straight toward the enemy aircraft, luring them in. A Lockheed Hudson finally crashed into the mast and fell. The Wu Maru, on the waters off Bantai, encountered a surfaced enemy submarine. It launched a surprise attack, and the enemy, in a panic, submerged and fled. Many ships, although attacked by enemy submarines and with their decks on fire, continued to fight the fire to prevent sinking and struggled to navigate to their destination, unloading their cargo and completing their mission.</p>
<p>The captains who steer, and the sailors who wield the guns, are truly valiant warriors of the sea, no less than combat soldiers.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>If large ships are the solid supply lines linking the rear areas with the bases, then motorized sailing ships are the vital links connecting the bases with the front lines. They cannot be severed and must be strengthened. The waters of the northern region need motorized sailing ships; without them, operations would be inconvenient. The sailors of maritime Japan, active in this region, are truly brave and reliable. We must remember here that the supply of sailors and the provision of weapons are also essential elements for achieving victory. (Bai Ying)</p>

<h3>Second Police Precinct Issues Opium Smoker Registration Permits</h3>
<p>The Second Police Bureau of this city has been ordered to assist in eradicating opium addiction in its jurisdiction and to register opium smokers. It is learned that the first thousand opium smoker registration permits have been obtained by the bureau from the Anti-Opium Bureau and will begin to be distributed starting yesterday. Opium smokers who have applied for registration with the Second Police Bureau can go directly to the Fifth Section of the bureau on Penglai Road to collect them. Opium smokers who have registered at the opium smoker registration offices of the various sub-bureaus of the bureau will be distributed after the second batch of permits is received.</p>
<h3>Huashan and Changning Sub-Bureaus Conduct Spot Checks on New Residence Permits</h3>
<p>Since the Huashan and Changning Police Sub-Bureaus began issuing new residence permits on April 10th of this year, the process has been progressing smoothly due to the close cooperation of the police and Baojia. However, some residents have been overly negligent. Even after repeated reminders, some have not gone to the bureau to have their fingerprints taken, or have had their fingerprints taken but have delayed in picking up the permits. This situation not only prevents the issuance of new residence permits from being completed properly, but also makes it difficult to clear up the household registration and population statistics. The Baojia section of the two sub-bureaus has obtained approval from the Bao and Tian Office of the General Bureau to conduct spot checks on new residence permits starting immediately. In areas where new residence permits have been issued, if anyone is found still holding an old residence permit and delaying the exchange for a new residence permit, the old residence permit will be confiscated in order to urge them to exchange for a new permit as soon as possible, so as to complete the permit exchange work within the time limit. Residents in the area who have not yet received their new permits should exchange for them as soon as possible to avoid trouble.</p>

<h3>Army and Civilians who Died on Saipan Island Displayed Noble Spirit; Statement by Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Army Press Department spoke yesterday to reporters, mentioning the spirit of the army and civilians on Saipan Island in perishing together with the island. The statement issued by the department is as follows: On the loss of Saipan Island, the strategic value should be explained, and the heroic fighting of the Japanese army and the self-sacrifice of the Japanese residents on the isolated island should be praised. The Imperial General Headquarters has already issued a statement on the 18th, and the Empire's determination has been clarified in Prime Minister Tojo's speech. The heroic fighting of the Imperial Army and Navy soldiers and the Japanese residents on Saipan Island has been described in detail in the statement of the Director of the Army and Navy Press Department of the General Headquarters. The self-sacrifice of the entire Imperial garrison follows the previous examples of Attu Island in the North Pacific and Makin and Tarawa Islands in the Central Pacific. However, the fact that Japanese residents joined the soldiers in facing the disaster and sacrificed themselves for the Greater East Asia Liberation War, dedicating their love for their motherland to the isolated island, began with Saipan Island. The last soldier of the army and navy forces on Saipan Island physically attacked the enemy. The situation at that time was fully described in the report sent by the commander of the island to the central government, word by word. It is deeply believed that all Asian nations of the same bloodline will be able to understand its noble spirit.</p>
<p>Spirit is more important than everything</p>
<p>The strategic value of Saipan Island in the Pacific War cannot be underestimated, but its value is not absolutely immutable and depends on whether it can fully demonstrate its value. Therefore, Japan's failure this time may turn into a blessing in disguise. Although this is a strategic issue, spirit has even more value. That is, the statement of the General Headquarters on Saipan Island can explain everything about how it will affect the Japanese people. When 100 million Japanese compatriots learned of the General Headquarters' announcement, their attitude was extremely calm, and their confidence in the final victory was not shaken in the slightest. To annihilate the American devils and avenge the loss of Saipan Island is a valuable lesson to be learned from the previous series of victories in the war. This is not only a gamble on the fate of one country, but it also determines whether the liberation of East Asia can be achieved or whether Greater East Asia will forever be held under the demonic claws of the Anglo-Americans. In the course of the Greater East Asia War, local changes are not surprising. The battlefield of the Greater East Asia War is not limited to the Pacific; the battlefield on the Chinese mainland is equally important. Today, the Japanese army is making favorable progress on this important battlefield, and the damage suffered by the US Air Force in Chongqing is extremely serious. It is believed that this can more than compensate for the unfavorable loss of Saipan Island.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Where Did the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Get a Large Quantity of Rice?</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, at 3:00 PM on the 17th, 180 bags of rice were suddenly moved into the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The source of this batch of rice has attracted close attention from the outside world. It is also heard that Mr. Wen Lanting, supervisor of the association, who is known for his impartiality and integrity and enjoys popular support, is particularly concerned about this issue due to his duties. Another source claims that this batch of rice was jointly purchased by more than ten employees of the Rice Control Association and stored in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>We have three questions about this matter: First, how could more than ten employees of the Rice Control Association happen to jointly purchase 180 bags of rice? Is this a way to avoid the requisition of 10 stone of rice or more by dividing it into smaller portions? Second, are employees of the Rice Control Association allowed to purchase and store rice exceeding the amount needed for three months? Third, is the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's address allowed to be used for storing large quantities of rice?</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have heard rumors that a certain important employee of the Rice Control Association has 600 dan of rice hidden at home. We will not discuss the rumors for now. However, regarding the credible information about a large quantity of rice being stored in the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, we hope that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce authorities will provide a clear answer. At the same time, we ask whether the Economic Security Department authorities have heard this news and whether they have paid attention to this matter.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Volleyball Match: Russian Émigrés Defeat China Film; China Film Suffers Straight-Set Defeat</h3>
<p>In the 33rd Shanghai Overseas Chinese Volleyball League, two matches were held yesterday, starting at 2:00 PM at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA Gymnasium. In the first match, the women's group of Zhiqian easily defeated the West Qinghong team by a score of twenty-one to thirteen. Zhiqian's players, all capable, gave their all. Weng Hanqing was particularly energetic, with her powerful and precise hitting. In the third game, Zhiqian won 21-9. In the second game, West Qinghong tried to struggle, but Zhiqian was well-rounded in both offense and defense, and won again 21-15. The last match was between Russian Émigré A and China Film in Group A. After the two sides made contact, only seven Russian Émigrés appeared. Unexpectedly, China Film, despite having a numerical advantage, suffered a crushing defeat. In the first game, the Russians won 21-13, and the second game went smoothly for the Russian Émigrés, who won again 25-11. The last game was also quickly decided, with the Russian Émigrés winning 21-11.</p>

<h3>Essentials for Constructing Air Raid Shelters</h3>
<p>For Factories:</p>
<p>Factories are often targets for bombing, so the necessity of shelters is self-evident. Adequate shelter drills are also absolutely necessary. Especially for important factories, because work cannot be stopped until danger is imminent, it is impossible to take refuge in distant locations, and shelters must be near the workplace. Therefore, sufficient preparation and research are required.</p>
<p>In principle, when constructing factory buildings, one can follow the general shelter guidelines for families. For reinforced concrete buildings, refer to the situation of office buildings mentioned above, and research accordingly. Factories often have equipment not found in ordinary homes, such as underground warehouses, which can be utilized as effective shelters. Furthermore, slightly altering the placement of materials and finished products can create gaps that serve as good shelters. Even without these, simply lying down between furniture and machinery can significantly reduce damage. Therefore, everyone should consider in advance what to do in a split second if a bomb falls.</p>
<p>However, if oil tanks or gunpowder magazines in a factory are damaged, the surrounding area will be extremely dangerous, so one must be careful to avoid these locations when taking refuge.</p>
<p>The above explanation has focused on shelters in ordinary residential homes, as well as construction methods for shelters in high-rise buildings and factories. Building styles vary greatly, and similarly, where and how to build shelters will also differ significantly.</p>
<p>In essence, when actually constructing shelters, one should fully understand the spirit of taking refuge and identify suitable locations for shelters, not adhering to formalities, but utilizing existing facilities and available materials. If unclear, seek guidance from those in charge.</p>
<p>Finally, after shelters are built, one must know the location of fire-fighting equipment such as sandbags and open spaces for evacuation, so that protective activities can be carried out immediately. Furthermore, communication with protection monitors and evacuation procedures must be thoroughly trained to effectively utilize the shelters.</p>
<p>In places without shelters, one must always remember that using nearby objects for cover and lying flat on the ground is the simplest method of refuge. (End)</p>

<h3>Implementing Agricultural Production to Serve the Nation</h3>
<p>Japanese Youth and Students</p>
<p>A new wind is blowing in the countryside. To produce even one more grain of rice, young students are wholeheartedly working in the fields, serving the nation through agriculture with fervent hearts. They believe that securing food supplies is of utmost importance, concerning the very life and death of Japan, especially in this decisive stage of the year. Their pure spirit of public service, burning passion, healthy bodies, and genuine thirst for knowledge... amidst unstoppable sweat, they happily and vigorously welcome the early summer breeze that caresses the rice paddies. Today, the village's heroic veterans, watching groups of schoolchildren carrying rice seedlings, running back and forth, and on their own working ridges, hang a flag with the words "Student Mobilization," flying high and deeply imprinted in their hearts.</p>
<p>Filled with Labor Enthusiasm</p>
<p>"Since coming here, everyone feels at ease. At school, we could never settle down..." The Second High School students, who have become rural youth after a reception ceremony was held in Nango Village, Toyu District, Miyazaki Prefecture, are diving into the rice paddies and working tirelessly. Their brows are filled with labor enthusiasm, and in their hearts, they believe that the safety and security of the nation are closely linked to their hard work.</p>
<p>Excellent students from the village, such as those from Utsunomiya Vocational Girls' High School, sleep at their work locations to save on travel time. Dressed in women's work clothes, with trousers and sleeves rolled up, they have already become mud-splattered and not-yet-skilled farmers in the swampy rice paddies. But these lovely young girls do not pity their fair and tender legs and arms, and they are even less afraid of getting dirty. When asked, "Is the teacher not here?" a woman immediately raises her head and says, "That's me." This teacher is also covered in mud and looks even younger than the students. Soon after, during a break, the female students sit neatly lined up under the shade of a tree, drinking tea brought by the young teacher in turns.</p>
<p>Children from the National School in Kito Village, Tamatsukuri District, Miyagi Prefecture, located between Akita and Yamagata Prefectures, gather wild vegetables at the foot of Mount Arao, a snow-covered mountain in the Ou Mountains, more than eight kilometers from the school. The fiddleheads gathered by the adorable and pitiful children have already been sent to the capital, amounting to as many as 18,000 "Next are the gathering of wood vine and mountain grapes. The grapes are raw materials for making acid salts that can turn salt water into fresh water. We want to turn the resources hidden in the mountains into combat power," said the principal, fully displaying the sun-blackened farmer in the mountains.</p>
<p>Outside Fukushima City, Fukushima Normal School has rented seven cho of farmland from farmers with labor shortages, and now they are even mobilizing children from the affiliated elementary school to harvest wheat. They are even harvesting earlier than the nearby villagers. It can be said that they are harvesting with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>All harvested grain is dedicated to the nation, and the harvested fields are then cultivated well before being returned to the villagers. All the students at the school are looking forward to the harvest season with abundant food. Since April, they have been enduring hunger every day, drinking thin porridge, and looking forward to the harvest.</p>
<p>Securing the National Food Supply</p>
<p>I have traveled on the Tohoku Railway, the Ou Railway, and the Shinetsu Railway, and other trains, and visited many villages. On every piece of beautiful land, one can see such hardworking students. This is not merely a small-scale effort to use the labor of young people, but rather to experience the harsh conditions of various productions in order to secure the food supply for the 100 million people. This is to display the spirit of serving the nation through agriculture and improving management techniques. Students serving in rural areas focus on these two points.</p>
<p>Nango Village, where the Second High School has been serving for four years, previously had a lot of idle land. However, due to the students' enthusiasm for labor, who only drink a little tea and then work with sweaty backs, the previously barren and empty land has been turned into fertile and beautiful fields. The entire village is united and desperately increasing production. After planting the rice, the students in Sendai are concerned about drought and rain, and they often make special trips to see their own cultivated fields. This scene shows how much they respect the agriculture of the Japanese imperial land! Agriculture in the Great Japanese Empire is by no means merely a profession for individual farmers to profit from, but rather a sacred patriotic undertaking that should be deeply felt in one's heart. This year's harvest is earlier than in previous years, demonstrating a labor spirit that inspires admiration.</p>
<p>The Agricultural School in Minamimurayama District, Yamagata Prefecture, is the successor to the Kokumin Higher School, a farm warrior dojo created by the spirit of Dr. Kakehiko Kazami and Mr. Motoji Kato. Therefore, the students of the school mobilized to build the Jinai Village reservoir dam, and they all worked silently and desperately with full discipline. This earth-shattering and tear-jerking enthusiasm left the farmers speechless. Work that ordinary people could not complete was finished by the students in less than a day, thus completely clearing away the laziness and bad habits in the village.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of improving management techniques, places such as Iwate Prefecture still adhere to established rules and follow the bad habits of individualism. Although there is a labor shortage, they are still unwilling to cooperate. However, the mobilization of students, because of collective labor, may be able to change the bad habits of the past. Currently, Tochigi Prefecture, which has backward agricultural technology, does not encourage planting and even leaves land barren, which is a barrier to increasing production. Student labor must plant according to regulations. There are five or six farming families in one village who do not ask students to cultivate and plant haphazardly. The village authorities then mobilized the students of the National Elementary School and completely cleared the barren land in one day.

<h3>Examination of Rice and Grain Issues in Various Regions</h3>
<p>Method to Revamp the Rice Control Committee</p>
<p>As noted earlier, the method to revamp the Rice Control Committee is not the personnel changes advocated by some people. While personnel refreshment is necessary, personnel are influenced by the organization, and the organization is influenced by the environment. It is meaningless to focus solely on minor personnel matters without first reforming the organization to adapt to the environment. Having visited various regions, the reporter was surprised to find that although the Rice Control Committee in Shanghai is large in scale, its local offices are mostly weak. As for the work situation, from criticisms heard from all sides, the work instructions of the Rice Control Committee headquarters do not go beyond the level of intermediary agencies. No wonder there are calls to completely abolish the offices. The structure of the Rice Control Committee truly feels like having one head and several thousand tails, and it is top-heavy. No matter which office you visit, although they have made many charts and statistics, they are merely a superficial statistical and graphical representation of the activities of purchasing merchants. A survey that can truly enable the Rice Control Committee headquarters to establish a correct policy is rarely seen. It is not surprising that this weak lower-level organization cannot promote the difficult and important work of rice and grain purchase. The lower-level organization of the Rice Control Committee is not organized based on the particularity of each region. For example, Suzhou is the location of the provincial government and the mental center of rural administration in Jiangsu Province, but the rice and grain mechanism cannot be implemented by the power of the Rice Control Committee alone. Its success depends entirely on its degree of contact and cooperation with various related agencies. Then, does the Suzhou office have the power to automatically promote contact with important agencies other than the Jiangsu Provincial Government? The Rice Control Committee headquarters should simply serve as a planning agency and a liaison agency, and in the four or five major distribution centers, it should strictly establish mobile Rice Control Committee branch offices with powerful authority. The actual work of the Rice Control Committee should be fully borne by these branch offices. The headquarters should supervise the branch offices and, based on their work, be responsible for national planning, control, and liaison. Seeking opinions from all parties indicates complete agreement with this emphasis on Shanghai. Many other departments have the same situation, resulting in the extremely worrying consequences of today. This must be specifically pointed out.</p>
<p>For example, purchasing merchants are not recommended by the county governments, county chambers of commerce, and rice industry associations of major rice-producing counties, but are determined based on advertisements in Shanghai newspapers and the self-recommendation movement of speculative rice merchants.</p>
<p>When designating purchasing merchants, the reporter pointed out that in the local areas, most of them are speculative and hoarding elements of the bad Lianyingshe system. The situation is largely the same not only in Changshu but also in various regions.</p>
<p>For example, in Songjiang County, only six out of twenty designated purchasing merchants borrowed purchasing funds from the Rice Control Committee, but they were eliminated for reasons of poor purchase performance. The remaining fourteen merchants also had poor performance, using their privileged status as the center of private transportation.</p>
<p>The trade association does not have the nature of a preparatory agency, but is merely a convenient designation for a group of individuals seeking profits. Therefore, if the hope of purchasing after the harvest is normal, it cannot be claimed that the office and the purchasing merchants should be completely reorganized.</p>
<p>In the early stages of work, those who expressed dissatisfaction with the unfair allocation of quotas in the purchase areas were these purchasing merchants. This kind of dissatisfaction is unavoidable in the early stages of work. However, this kind of dissatisfaction is definitely not issued to achieve good purchasing results, but is a strategy to rationalize the reasons for poor purchasing results. In areas where the quotas are very fair, the purchasing performance of each merchant is not as good as expected. Therefore, if the purchase is not smooth, one must seek it from other reasons. To achieve fairness, excellent old rice merchants must first be designated and mobilized.</p>
<p>The Foundation of the Rice Control Committee's Work</p>
<p>The foundation for purchasing rice and grain is definitely not the frequently changing upper-level rice and grain structure, nor is it the local offices without middle ground. The unit agencies that become the foundation of this work are the ones that have strong lower-level organizations in various regions since the incident and have made the greatest efforts to fulfill their missions regardless of how the upper-level organization changes. There is no need to list here what kind of agency this is. These agencies have adapted to changes without changing and have made the greatest efforts to purchase rice and grain. This reality should be fully noted in promoting future work.</p>
<p>Taking the purchase work that began last year as an example, there are existing purchasing merchants in various regions, as well as agencies providing assistance from the side. Their experience has been accumulated since the incident. If funds and prices can be determined early, these agencies can immediately overcome all difficulties and take concrete actions. The upper-level organization of the Rice Control Committee, the lower-level organization, and the funds supplied to the interior are all too slow. The Kunshan office was established at the end of November. By the time the welcoming meeting for the director of the office, who had no experience in purchasing rice and grain, was held, the purchasing merchants could not but sit back and watch the rice and grain market decline.</p>
<p>The main body responsible for purchasing rice and grain should be in the interior. Based on this understanding, the future lower-level organization should be reorganized and abolished.</p>
<p>The most necessary organization in the interior is not the existing Rice Control Committee offices in various regions, but a liaison body of various related agencies that can be called the Rice and Grain Control Council. For this liaison body, there is no reason to object to the Rice Control Committee establishing a practical office to present its policy. Various local offices have requested the establishment of armed inspection teams. This proposal was also made at the Rice Control Committee joint meeting. The Rice Control Committee itself has also applied to the Executive Yuan for approval to establish an inspection team. This policy is probably based on the idea that everything should be handled by the Rice Control Committee itself. But can today's weak offices be more active than other armed groups? According to what the reporter has heard, although the Nanjing office has set up an armed inspection team, its achievements are not enough to build. Having experienced various regions, the request to set up armed inspection teams is still heard today. Just like Shanghai, the Economic Security Office inspects private transportation and hoarding. Similar agencies should be responsible for inspection in the interior.</p>
<p>New policies should naturally be promoted. However, if people in the interior misunderstand this as a measure for light-framed institutions, it should be strictly rejected. A light-framed institution will only result in chaos. (Translated from the Mainland News, June 27)</p>

<h3>Lessons from France for Us</h3>
<p>In this world war, France is a country in a most tragic and difficult situation. After the outbreak of the Western European war in 1940, under the blitzkrieg of Germany, the Maginot Line, which France had painstakingly built and considered impregnable, was quickly breached, and the capital, Paris, was soon occupied. At that time, the German army advanced rapidly and irresistibly, and France was truly in danger of being destroyed. Fortunately, an elderly general, seeing that the country had already been defeated and could not fight any longer, bravely stepped forward and signed an armistice agreement with Germany, rescuing France from the abyss of destruction. This, for France, was originally doing what had to be done and stopping where it had to stop. However, Britain and the United States were too cruel to France from then on. On the one hand, they supported de Gaulle in carrying out the movement to split France; on the other hand, they directly put pressure on France, constantly hitting France, such as freezing French funds and trade, blockading French food, attacking the French navy, and even plundering French overseas colonies. France always swallowed its anger, initially wanting to maintain friendly relations with Britain and the United States. When it realized this was impossible, it still tried its best to avoid a direct conflict with Britain and the United States. France did its utmost to compromise and did not offend Britain and the United States. However, Britain and the United States always harbored the ambition to sacrifice France and invade Europe. Recently, they even brazenly landed on the Normandy Peninsula, aiming to attack Paris. From then on, French territory once again became the battlefield between the anti-Axis and Axis forces. The French people, who had survived the war and whose wounds had not yet healed, once again suffered from the ravages of war, displaced and living in misery. Their fate is truly tragic.</p>
<p>We sympathize with France's situation and experience, and at the same time, we believe that France is a good mirror for us, giving us a great lesson. There are things that we should emulate from France, but we cannot proactively seize the opportunity. We could have avoided falling into the same tragic fate as France, but we have brought the country to such a state. It is truly heartbreaking to talk about.</p>
<p>France was defeated and could not fight any longer, so it resolutely decided to make peace with Germany in order to save the country's fate and preserve the country's strength. This is a manifestation of the authorities' loyalty to the country and their sincere patriotism. Therefore, the French people all understood the authorities' painstaking efforts and supported the government's policies. The Chongqing authorities are also not unaware that they have been defeated and cannot fight any longer. In the past seven years, there have been opportunities for China and Japan to end the war and achieve peace. But why couldn't the Chongqing authorities show the same loyalty to the country and patriotic sincerity as Marshal Pétain, seize the opportunity, and change their policies to end the cruel war and preserve the country's vitality? Why do they have to rely on Britain and the United States, beg for mercy from Britain and the United States, and why can't they break free from the manipulation of Britain and the United States, reject the instigation of Britain and the United States, and even know that they are being used by Britain and the United States, controlled by Britain and the United States, and still do not hesitate to lead the wolf into the house, handing over our beautiful land to British and American imperialism as a base for invading China and dominating East Asia? Chongqing treats the American air force in China with the courtesy of honored guests, while they destroy our cities every day, slaughter our compatriots, and destroy our industries. This is truly heartbreaking. On the other hand, since British and American imperialism want to use the Chinese mainland as a base for invading East Asia, Japan, although it does not regard China as an enemy, must adopt the strategy of preemptive strikes and fighting on the Chinese mainland in order to defeat Britain and the United States. The Sino-Japanese Incident, which has lasted for seven years and cannot be ended, has made the Chinese mainland the main battlefield for Japan against Britain and the United States. The continuous wars have only caused suffering to our people. Isn't the fate of the Chinese people even more tragic than the fate of the French people?</p>
<p>Although France made peace with Germany, the European war has not yet ended, and the German army still controls the main cities of France. For this reason, although the French authorities tried their best to avoid war, they could not do so in the end. This is also a helpless matter and can only be attributed to fate. However, the French authorities have done their best in the past four years and can be said to be innocent of the country and the people. China's predicament is the result of poor planning. Because this tragic fate could have been avoided, but it was not avoided, and instead it was brought about. Isn't this the result of poor planning? If the Chongqing authorities had abandoned the policy of resistance and achieved comprehensive peace long ago, independence and autonomy would have been achieved long ago. There would have been no need to beg for mercy from Britain and the United States or to lead the wolf into the house. Even if British and American imperialism wanted to use China to control China as a base for invading East Asia, they would have no opportunity to do so. When the puppet government was established, the Japanese side solemnly stated that once comprehensive peace between China and Japan was achieved, Japan would immediately withdraw its troops from China. If Chongqing had stopped resisting and achieved comprehensive peace at that time, Japan would have fulfilled its promise to withdraw troops, and the Chinese people could have lived and worked in peace, recuperated, and avoided the pain of war forever. But because comprehensive peace was not achieved, Japan failed to withdraw its troops. At the same time, the Chongqing authorities did not realize this and were unwilling to abandon the policy of resistance, so they could not break free from the control of British and American imperialism. In addition, the United States suffered repeated blows in the Pacific and wanted to use the Chinese mainland as a base to launch air raids on the Japanese mainland in order to reverse the decline. Therefore, Japan's countermeasures had to be carried out on the Chinese mainland to destroy British and American bases. For these reasons, it looks as if China will become a second France, suffering a more tragic fate than France. In the past, we did not do our best, resulting in today's misfortune. If we can try to reverse the situation now, it is still not too late. It only requires a change of heart from the Chongqing authorities. Only by stopping the resistance and achieving peace can China be liberated from the clutches of British and American imperialism, and can China be saved from an irredeemable fate.</p>

<h3>When Can the City Consumer Cooperative Distribute Goods?</h3>
<p>— Shao Ji</p>
<p>I am a member of the Shanghai City Consumer Cooperative and an employee of a very small store. The cooperative has been established for more than a year, and its purpose is to reduce the burden on citizens and avoid exploitation by middlemen in order to serve society. Unexpectedly, it is completely inconsistent with the facts. It only distributes unimportant items, and after distributing them once or twice, there is no news. When I learned about the distribution, I took time off to go shopping, but the order was chaotic and crowded. I waited for two hours. Because there were few people in the store, I could not spend too much time, and since it was only ordinary items, I returned to the store.</p>
<p>In this way, I contributed one hundred yuan per share, and they solicited 50,000 members. At one hundred yuan per share, it is also a considerable sum. Moreover, in the first half of last year, where did the cooperative deposit this large sum of money, in which bank, for what purpose? It should be reported and the accounts should be made public to inform all members. The inside story of the cooperative is another matter. The "Social Service" column of the News Daily also questioned this on the twelfth of this month. It is said that there are only two young ladies managing the cooperative, and they do not go there often because there is no work. Everything is presided over by a certain manager of the cooperative, and there is no second advisor. These famous people are just figureheads. They are busy enough with their own affairs. Isn't this just using their names to attract members at the time of establishment? I wonder when this manager will be able to distribute goods for the citizens' consumption.</p>

<h3>A Record of Recovery from Miliary Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Ye Jun</p>
<p>A few days ago, this column solicited prescriptions for miliary tuberculosis (commonly known as "Hundred-Day Cough"), or those who had suffered from this disease and have now fully recovered. Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Ye Jun, detailing his own illness and recovery process, which is very valuable. We are publishing Dr. Ye's letter for the reference of the medical community and those suffering from the same disease. —Editor's Note</p>
<p>Many of my relatives died from tuberculosis, so from the beginning of my career as a doctor, I paid attention to this disease. I even prepared an X-ray machine and focused on studying this disease. In 1940, due to overwork and a bad mood, I also suffered from this serious illness. After consultation with senior colleagues, I was diagnosed with the most terrifying miliary tuberculosis. The cold and fever fluctuated, changing several times a day, reaching as high as 42 degrees Celsius and as low as 39 degrees Celsius. The sputum was either pus or blood, and I lost my appetite completely. At that time, I had already prepared my will and autobiography, and considered myself a living dead man. Whenever my mood relaxed, I felt optimistic about my body, like a prisoner on death row who was given a reprieve. One more breath meant one more moment of happiness. So I injected a small amount of morphine (0.003) subcutaneously once, three times a day, and also used large amounts of calcium propylate and vitamin C for daily injections. After a week, my condition improved. Then I went to the countryside to recuperate for six months, continuing the injections as before, and also taking the following important medicine, one dose per day. After four months, the cough stopped, the sputum disappeared, and I could move as usual. (Chinese medicine formula: Angelica 3 qian, ginger 2 slices, turtle shell 1 liang.) Today, my body is strong and healthy, no different from before. The difficulties and pain of the past, when I think of them now, are like a dream. Because I see others suffering from the same disease, I dare to share my sincere thoughts. There is no shortage of people suffering from the same disease. If they read this article and can cross to the other shore, the credit should go to your newspaper's "Social Service" column for serving society. During the recovery period, sunlight, air, nutrition, abstinence, tranquility, and medicine are all indispensable.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Purchase at the Ancient and Modern Artifacts Charity Exhibition</h3>
<p>Since its opening, the "Ancient and Modern Artifacts Charity Exhibition" has been visited by a steady stream of people. Mr. Lin Kanghou also came yesterday afternoon despite the heat and purchased many charity items. The exhibition displays no fewer than thousands of items, from the Three Dynasties and the Han Dynasty to the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. There are also five hundred Arhats painted on silk by the Qing Dynasty Royal Painting Academy, painted in the Tibetan style, totaling thirty huge volumes, a rare treasure. The photography of Lin Yuren, the pastel paintings of Gu Tingkang, and the oil paintings are all exquisite and deeply appreciated by the audience. Because the exhibition received too many items, it could not display them all at the same time. Starting today, a large number of items will be replaced to avoid disappointment. The proceeds from the charity sale will be used entirely for public welfare undertakings such as helping students and charity. With the school year about to begin, out-of-school children are in urgent need of rescue. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically purchase charity items to contribute to the good cause. Dr. Song Daren, a specialist in stomach and intestinal diseases, also participated in the exhibition with many of his medical works, especially the "Eight Heroes of Chinese Medicine," which is his painstaking masterpiece, taking many years to complete. It has inscriptions by famous people and is extremely valuable. The original painting is not for sale, but reordering can be discussed. There are also four landscape paintings, painted in a bold and unrestrained style, both vigorous and beautiful, rarely seen. A painting of a standing crane, with outstanding charm, is inscribed by Mr. Xie Tihong, making it even more valuable.</p>
<h3>Good Progress in Obligatory Inducement of Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>The obligatory inducement of quitting smoking, organized by the Nantong Road Zhongjiao Daoyi Association under special contract with this office, was implemented in its first phase on the 16th of this month. All those who submitted themselves to quitting were able to arrive on time. After a physical examination, except for those suffering from lung disease and heart disease who could not be treated, a total of ten qualified people were admitted. The association specially designated a room on the fourth floor as a dormitory, and doctors such as Cai Daming presided over the matter. The method of quitting smoking is to inject "Sookomtopin" once every five hours after entering the conversion center in order to gradually eliminate toxins. At the same time, attention is paid to the patients' symptoms at all times, and glucose, vitamin B, and cardiotonic injections are administered separately to enhance resistance. Therefore, the cost of injections alone is more than four to five thousand yuan per patient.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Nursing Home Appeals for Assistance from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Nursing Home at No. 39 Jichang Street, founded forty years ago by Catholic nuns with a spirit of universal love, accommodates elderly men and women over the age of sixty who are poor and have no one to rely on. The original quota was 300 people, but it has increased to 350 people since the war. Some of the elderly in the home are healthy and willing to help with operations, so they are given some work to pass the time. However, most of them are old and infirm, and the nuns must take care of everything, from getting up early and going to bed late, morning and evening meals, pillows and clothes, washing and combing. Even bathing requires careful support. When they are sick, the nuns serve medicine, and after death, they are properly buried. All of this is done by the nuns themselves. The home has no fixed funds and relies entirely on external donations. Now that the city's situation is very different, the problem of livelihood is becoming increasingly serious. Even in terms of rice alone, the home needs two stones of rice every day. Now that rice prices are soaring, they have to use mixed grains such as mountain glutinous rice flour, which is not very suitable for the elderly, but they have to do it. However, the daily requirement for rice is still one and a half stones, not including other expenses such as fuel. Without assistance, it will be difficult to sustain, and the home is on the verge of running out of food. Therefore, it is earnestly hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate to provide relief, and that enthusiastic people will appeal on their behalf, so that everyone can contribute and many small efforts can make a big difference, so that hundreds of helpless elderly people can be spared the fate of being left in the gutter. Donation collection points: Nanshi Zhanjiang Street No. 39 Nursing Home. Guangzhong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Henan Road. Lihe Paper Store at No. 8, Lane 389, Jinling Road.

<h3>Charity Sale of Singer's Photos</h3>
<p>Miss Mei Ying, a famous singer, recently had Mr. Zhao Zhiming of Asia Photography Studio take two photos of her during her broadcasts and in her recent casual wear. Listeners admired her name and flocked to ask for photos. In order to raise money for the poverty relief fund, the studio obtained Miss Mei Ying's consent to have her personally sign the photos and entrust them to this office for public charity sale. Each photo costs 200 yuan. After deducting the cost of 80 yuan, the remaining amount will be donated to the poverty relief fund in Miss Mei Ying's name. All are welcome to purchase.</p>
<h3>Dongting Mountain Fellow Association's Scholarship</h3>
<p>The Dongting West Mountain Fellow Association's scholarship for this year will be open for applications starting today and will close at the end of this month. All primary and secondary school students from West Mountain who are studying in Shanghai, have excellent grades, and come from poor families can obtain application forms from the association's correspondence office at No. 204 Shandong Road and fill them out according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>Donation to Maternity Fund</h3>
<p>The maternity assistance movement is one of the services provided by this office. Poor pregnant women can register with this office one month before delivery.</p>
<p>For normal births, a midwife will be sent to assist with the delivery. If there are difficult births, hospitalization will be allowed, and all expenses will be borne by this office.</p>
<p>Donating to the maternity fund has the utmost meaning of protecting mothers and babies. It is hoped that all sectors will enthusiastically donate.</p>
<p>Hiring a Midwife A large hospital in this city is in urgent need of hiring two midwives who have graduated from the school. Those willing to take the job can contact and register with the job placement department of the Shanghai Special City Midwives Association at No. 251 Xinzha Road.

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Blood and Tears (1)</p>
<p>Ten</p>
<p>Makoto and Takao left the apartment at nine o'clock the next day. Such a beautiful house, happily rented to naval officers, was also a local custom. The landlady of Makoto's apartment was a widow in her fifties and a skilled embroiderer.</p>
<p>"When returning to port, I always hope to enjoy some family happiness, so we chose such a place. That family is very harmonious and kind, but there are many girls..."</p>
<p>"Isn't that good?"</p>
<p>Takao joked with Makoto and suddenly laughed himself.</p>
<p>"No, it's annoying!"</p>
<p>Makoto's tone was very serious.</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Recently, something happened. Usually when I'm taking a bath, suddenly they start practicing embroidery outside the bathroom. Because there are so many girls, I can't go out naked. I had to wait for them to finish practicing embroidery before I could leave the bathroom, but being steamed by the heat in the bathroom, the taste of bitterness is really indescribable. I think submarines must have this unspeakable feeling when they are submerged for a long time on the equator."</p>
<p>Such words, spoken with a slightly shy expression on his face, could not help but make Takao laugh. Although Makoto was wearing a military uniform today, striding forward with great strides, his face still showed a youthful attitude. Takao then thought of Makoto's long-forgotten nickname "Apple." Rosy cheeks, just like in the military student era, exuded an air of virginity.</p>
<p>(I'm not as pure as Makoto...)</p>
<p>Takao unconsciously began to feel ashamed of his Tokyo life.</p>
<p>"This is Zhongtong Road! It's the most lively and prosperous street!"</p>
<p>Makoto explained, rows of lily-of-the-valley lamps lined the bustling street. There were no trams, so it wasn't like Ginza, but more like Dotonbori. Perhaps because it was Sunday, there were many sailors and non-commissioned officers coming and going on the street. Looking at Makoto, raising his hand with a red armband, carrying out the salute one by one.</p>
<p>Reaching the intersection, Makoto said:</p>
<p>"Kure is such a terrible city, there's no place to visit. That's the naval base, above is the Naval Club, but let's go to the submarine school first!"</p>
<p>"That's what I thought too."</p>
<p>A business car happened to be stopped in front, and Makoto called it over.</p>
<p>Getting into the car, Makoto said:</p>
<p>"The submarine school may be Kure's most famous place. All the citizens visit to buy souvenirs. But how many people really want to join a submarine? At the same time, how many people want to know the history of the perseverance of submarine soldiers?"</p>
<p>Finally, he spoke such indignant words. (120)</p>
