<h3>塔克羅班海敵船　神風隊予以猛炸　靖國飛行隊勇士完成衝撞目標</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日下午發表：日神風特别攻擊隊，十一月二十六日猛攻塔克羅班海面敵運輪船　，擊沉大型運輪船一艘。　日軍航空部隊，十一月二十九日擊沉於雷伊泰　內之敵運輪船一艘。三十日於帛琉島東方海面擊毁運軟輪船一艘。</p>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日靖國飛行隊第二陣隊大坪。秦兩少尉及六勇士，將知敵艦船大部炸沉。二十九日　與愛機同歸於衋。　　衛戰鬥機每於突入敵戰鬥機隊　後，即與之激戰，日機雖損失二架，但卒將六勇士引至敵艦船上空。靖國飛行隊第一陣四勇士，於雷伊泰海上先後陣亡，其後發現以戰艦及巡洋艦掩護這敵船國，是時六勇士所駕駛之六機即解散隊伍，各向目標迎頭痛擊。初日機一架首先撞中敵戰艦後，第二架即繼續撞擊，是時，敵戰艦即被煙火包圍，一時火光沖天，其他四架亦不敢示弱，先後向敵船　撞去，於是敵大型運輪船三艘即相繼爆炸沉没。因此，日陸軍特攻隊自出動以來，以三十架飛機所擊沉之敵艦船　達二十二艘（內戰艦四艘）之多。</p>
<p>菲島日軍基地一日中央社電　日航空部隊呼應雷伊泰島陸戰，連日出去予敵陸上部隊以重　。二十九日夜，日陸軍機　隊，更出動　炸卡裏加拉市周邊敵陸上部隊，並加以掃射，予以甚大打擊，日全機安返。</p>
<h3>日大本營昨發表摩羅泰綜合戰果　航空隊强襲炸毁兩機場</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日大本營一日下午二時四十分發表：摩羅泰島日軍依挺進突擊，予敵以莫大損害，兼以日軍航空隊之運日强襲，壓制敵軍對該島機場之使用。自九月十五日敵軍登陸以來，至十一月二十一日止，日軍收獲戰果如下：殺傷敵人二千八百三十一名，內高級將官四人，　獲及炸毁砲八門，房舍及帳幕八十四幢，掩蓋陣地，其他物資儲藏所洗車類等多數，日方損失戰死八十六名。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地一日中央社電　日軍航空隊二十九日夜半猛襲摩羅泰島　敵第一及第二機場，第一機場北側之掩　地區兩處中彈起炸，確認該二處掩　地區全部爆炸。第二機場北側之掩　地區及南側掩　地區，亦均各有一處起炸，並確認距該機場五百米地點，亦因誘導性爆炸物起火，日軍全機歸還。</p>
<h3>東印青年請願自炸攻擊訓練</h3>
<p>爪中爾達一日中央社電　日特别攻擊隊必死必殺之奮戰，已使印度納西亞青引起勇猛精進之情緒，最近曼得鳥恩州奉公推進隊青年四百人，會向史加爾諾請願，　開始訓練自炸攻擊對抗之來犯，以堅其擊滅敵艦隊之決意。同時，並請其將此意轉達日最高指揮官，史加爾諾即於二十九日之爪哇奉公會中央會議中，報告此輩青年之熱烈情緒，予該會議員以莫大感奮。氏在會議中並促一般人士猛省，請願　負此輩青年之熱意，自炸攻擊隊此種至誠，實足與日特别攻擊隊相與媲美，其對全島青年，更足以發揚其澎湃決死，奮鬥精神，實唯有決死人才能獲得勝利，而爭取印度納亞之独立，此種決意，在印度納西亞，今已更　昂揚矣。</p>
<h3>敵楊一架　偵察沖繩島</h3>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>冬賑</h3>
<p>昨天　然西風凜冽，氣候轉寒，每個人添上寒衣，還是瑟縮呼寒。可是，我們試瞑目一想，如果没有寒衣添的同胞將怎樣？今年的物價出乎意外的不斷暴漲，大都數　貧之家，無衣無食，比較往年更爲普遍。而一般露宿街頭，人冷風怒號中掙扎者，尤爲淒慘。我們差幸暖衣飽食者，對於此輩同胞爲能無同情與惻隱之心呢？</p>
<p>同情與惻隱的表示，無非量力捐助，無衣者施衣，無食者施粥。可是，這一件工作，與其零零碎碎局部的做，不如集中而整個的做，比較普遍有效。換句話說，就是應該由政府領導主持，籌集經費，通　　　，利用慈善團體的熟練人才，辦賑　　。同時，市民大眾的量力捐助。所以，現在政府發動冬賑，已經是迫切的時機了。</p>
<p>頃據確息，市府當局已經決定籌高冬賑委員會，辦理本年度的冬賑。同時，今年辦理地冬賑，有兩點特色，值得欣幸的。第一是經費充實，聞當局決定冬賑經費的數目，相當龐大而且已有籌捐的把握。第二是人事充實。聞冬賑工作人員同，在本市辦理較有成績的各慈善團體中，遴選熟練而富有經驗的辦事人員，暫時調用。冬賑原是每年的例行工作，而今年的冬賑，有此兩種特色，自然比較曆年的冬賑工作爲進步。所以，同時希望社會有力分子，充分協力，順利完成今年的冬賑工作。多多救濟貧苦同胞。</p>
<p>本市市政　詢委員會，今天適將舉行全體委員會議，我們請求　詢委員會諸者，對於信年冬賑工作，特别注意，充分提供意見，以備當局參考。　詢委員諸君在社會上頗有地位與聲望。同時，對於慈善工作也有實際經驗，希望討論一個最妥善切實的辦法，建議當局。我們相信　詢委員討倫決定的辦法，對上能邀當局接受，對下能得市民信任。而在呼籲市民協力時，也必能獲得最大的響應與效果。</p>
<p>最後，我們於　望今年冬賑工作，進行順利，貧苦市民，確落實　之餘，還有幾點瑣細的建議：　辦事人員薪給及辦公費用，最好以不開支賑款爲原則，而由政府給付。　所有施賑的棉布米糧，最好幫配給機關配給，按照配給價格給價，而不向黑市採購，因爲限市價格既然太高，且漫無標准，不易　核。　施賑對象，首以露宿街頭的無衣無食之輩，同時利用冬賑機會，將此輩遊民施以收容，或與遊民勞動營連絡，遣送收容。其次，則爲一般　貧亦貧之軍。</p>
<h3>奉行　主席遺志　中國國民黨告民從書　（四）</h3>
<p>中日兩大國家亟應相互提攜</p>
<p>夫「中日兩國，壤土相接，　鄰友好，有其自然與必要。我總理於創立中國革命同盟會之初，即手定　綱，主張中日兩國國民大聯合。六年歐戰方酣之時，復發表中國存亡問題一書，明示一日本與中國之關係，實爲存亡安危兩相關聯者，無日本即無中國，無中國亦無日本，爲謀兩國百年之安，必不可於期間稍存芥蒂。」十三年春。講述三民主義，又於民權主義中，指出中日兩國及亞洲民族聯合之必要。現年冬北上，繞道日本，演講大亞洲主義，更言之諄諄，期望日本援助中國，廢除不平等條約。更斷言中日兩大民族，爲亞洲独立運動之原動力，聯合奮　有必然者。我總理在生之日，不及見中日合作之具體實現，而根本方針已定於是。國民革命之目的，在求中國之自由平等，欲求中國之自由平等不能不同時求亞洲之独立解決；欲求亞洲之独立解決，不能不聯合亞洲被壓迫民族共同奮　，尤其不能不聯合中日兩大民族　共同奮鬥，其理至明。數十年來，雙方背道而馳，日積月累，導致兩國邦交，　形恶劣，究其原因，則外來的　誘，固其一端，而內在的隔閡，各自有其責任。鑒往思來，亦　痛加反省，各自明瞭其責任，互尊互諒，以謀合理之解決，庶不致爲親者所痛，而仇者所快。二十一年，淞滬停戰協定，二十二年，塘沽停戰協定，無非一本斯旨，期於軍事行動停止之後，兩國間逆轉之關係，得以歸於好轉而已。此種努力，至二二四年春間，已獲有關　之進步。日本方面，於帝國議會發表對華外交三大原則，我國方面，亦於中央政治會議，宣示中日外交根本方針，兩國間既有如此之共鳴，本此折衝，未始不可解除糾紛，促進友好之初基。　　此一年間，國際局勢醞釀變化，帝國主義者乘虛而入，實行其第三期間接的操縱。由是一誤於英國李滋羅斯之　　協定，再誤於蘇聯及共產黨之慫恿與挑撥，根本方針，一變再一變。二十六年二月，本黨五届三中全會，雖猶標示「對內求自立，對外求共存」之政策，認定對內求自立，則必須團結民　，並注重生　建設，對外求共存，則必須循國際和平之路线以前進，而危機潛伏，一觸即發。事前之預防，既未能把握定策，事後補救，又不能因時應變。於是貽誤再三，徒惑於英美三個月內出而幹涉之空言，釀成八一三上海之戰，使戰事由黄河流域，延至長江南北，復格於蘇聯之壓迫，與共產黨之威脅，致令可能之調停，未由促進，坐失良機。二十七年四月，本黨臨時宣言申明「本人之本願在和平，吾人之最終希望，仍在和平，」而形格　木禁，僵局未由打開，戰爭依然繼續。　後國境日　，世變益亟，滿目焦土，遍野哀鴻，時勢至此，而和平運動乃如箭在弦上，不得不發動矣。然每於和平運動進入一新階段之際，或國際局勢醞釀一新變化之時，我主席必痛陳利害，對重慶方而致忠告，蓋自始自終，期以統一之黨，統一之國，共謀統一這和平也。</p>
<p>深冀同心戮力實現全面和平</p>
<p>二十七年十二月二十九日，我主席發表　電倡導和平，所建議於重慶方面者，即本此意。二十八年秋，本黨第六次全國代表大會之後，德蘇戰爭初起之時，繼發　電，力言以抗戰勝利之希望，寄托於國際援助之非計，强國之風雲變幻，端倪莫測，弱國之遠交近攻，徒受其禍，中日兩國當此旋震憾之時，宜深相結合，不以東亞納此漩渦之中，所期待於重慶方面者，其用意亦稪如是。二十九年春，國民政府還都之前，再發表　電，申明「和平方案基礎已具，中國所可得到者，不惟非亡國條件，且循此力行，中國之独立自由可保，三民主義之建設可以成」。「惟和平之實現，全國一致，乃能迅速瑞普遍」撤兵問題，亦同此理，爲使國力民力不復長此耗竭，勢爲「先以全力從事於局部的和平，而猶深冀同心戮力，使全而和平，早日實現」。其對於淪方，責之者彌重望之者彌厚，及同年十一月，中日基本關係條約簽訂之前，復發感電，「以戰爭狀態，依然存在，伴隨此戰爭狀態而起之事實，遂亦有不得不聽其存在者，此種痛苦。非至全面和平實現之後，不能全部解除，爲此切盼勿在遷延，立下決心，宣布停戰」。此可謂以至率真之坦懷，爲至懇切之忠告者矣。後此數年，在廣播演講及各種言論中，對於淪方，無不深致期待。三十年二月，發起東亞聯盟運動，揭　政治独立，軍事同盟，經濟合作，文化溝通四大綱領。同年十二月八日，太平洋戰事發生，中日事變既一變而爲保衛東亞之戰爭，排除侵略，還我自由之機運，緊隨而至，我　主席更不斷喚起渝方注意，惟其所以鍥而不舍者，蓋亦始終期望彼此同心同　，經擺脱百年來所加於吾人頭上之鎖鏈而已（未完）</p>
<h3>日軍攻略南丹　仍繼續進攻　獲各種軍火甚多</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日本大本營一日下午三時發達，沿黔桂鐵路作戰中之日軍，十一月二十二日攻略金城江及河池，二十八日攻略南丹，與　日突破黎明關，進入貴州省之日軍，共同繼續進攻中。又日軍航空部隊遮斷金城江附近鐵道後，遂在該地及河池附近，　獲軍頭十輛貨車四百二十輛，戰車及汽車一百二十一輛，各種砲七十六門，槍械約一千六百支及其他兵器·彈藥，各種零件等甚夥。</p>
<p>合眾社稱日軍從黔</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　渝軍當局對日軍攻入貴州之事實，雖　行隱蔽，但據合眾社重慶訊，日軍已入貴州，其情形如次：駐渝美空軍第十四航空隊司令部，頃發表日軍已進入貴州省內，同時並認爲日軍有進攻省會貴陽之勢。並謂會對自貴州省進攻，自江都公路上之日軍，加以空襲。根據以上事實，證明對企圖保衛貴陽之渝軍，已行突破，甚至已將渝軍包圍。駐渝美軍司令官威德邁雅變謂：美空軍會攻擊南丹及河池附近日軍，又據路透社訊，據渝當局三十日夜發表，日軍現於河池北方迂回至渝軍後方，渝軍刻仍保持該市西北方廿三公裏地點之各陣地。</p>
<p>美司令述華南戰局</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電　據重慶電　渝美軍司令威德邁雅，三十日會見記者團時，對華南戰局說明如次：中國戰局對我方固　不利，但我方正講求挽回頹勢之方策。自廣西向桂林攻擊之日軍，多係强而有力，富於攻擊力者。南　陷落之意義，一爲美空軍基地之喪失，一爲日軍完成自東京往廣西·安南·以抵昭南之陸路聯絡线。日軍現於廣西·貴州方面之作戰，餘每日與蔣介石氏及新任軍政部長陳　氏會見，重慶方面將尽最大努力，與美軍協力雲。</p>
<p>日機炸黔桂路鐵橋</p>
<p>中央社電　日軍急降轟炸機隊，二十九日晚　恶劣天氣，急襲黔桂鐵路之要衝蜀山附近　向距梭山八公里之鐵橋投彈，將炸破，遮斷渝　軍之退路，同時據該機之偵察報告稱，蜀山被渝軍入火燃烧中</p>

<p>里斯本一日中央社電　美聯社重慶訪員二十九日說明，貴陽方面因日軍中心地帶，頓呈大混亂。據謂　前线歸還重慶之空軍人員黎，貴陽一地因日軍進攻迅速，茲已成爲數十萬難民之移動中心地帶雲。茲日軍先頭部隊，沿黔貴鐵路，已開抵貴陽南方二百二十五公裏之地點，因此貴陽即陷於人口過剩之狀態。蓋當現在之難民集團，擁至貴陽之前，該市之人口爲二十萬，惟今已突破三十八萬人。無家可歸之難民刻正擁擠於公園街路，或公共汽車站。同時食糧之價格，亦　增至二倍。一月前之米每石爲法幣一萬二千元，今突增至萬餘元。此外由於運輪機關之制衡，及難民避在重慶方面者之眾多，黑市價格亦猛漲不已。由貴陽至重慶之公共汽車票，增至四萬元之　，至於商人亦積極將商品搬往重慶，並傳運輪車每輛之運費須三十萬元云。</p>
<h3>新運增產　視察團返京</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　新運會日軍增產視察團一行，於一日晨返京。該視察團此次赴日視察增產概況，深入民間，與日本農村人民共同生活，祥細調查。　與戰時日本下我僑日同胞與留學生舉行懇切之座談會，及生活情況之調查，月餘以來，會赴各地國民小學校，參觀國防訓練生活訓練，增產訓練，以及名古屋　工場學生動員情況，於二十六日視察工作完畢，返國抵京。聞報告書十日內即將提出。</p>
<h3>雷伊泰島日軍　開始新攻勢　肉搏攻擊隊迭獲戰果</h3>
<p>菲島方面一日中央社電　雷伊泰島西岸答姆拉安方面，日軍自二十七日傍晚起，因新銳砲兵陣之增强，再度開始猛攻，攻略答姆拉安北方之敵方據點，現更繼續攻擊中。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地一日中央社電　雷伊泰日軍肉搏突擊隊，自十一月十一日連續進攻布羅普及塔加米西主高地斜面之敵軍陣地以來，至二十日止二週內所獲戰果如次：敵軍屍三百二十六具，　獲或破壞品計火箭一，砲二，機關槍一架，自動步槍十一枝，卡車一輛，引曳車五，無线電機二，其他彈藥等多數戰利品。</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社电　據舊金山廣播綜合雷伊泰島前线消息，日將爲應付美軍之新大作戰，刻已計劃先發制人之大反攻。據日方消息，雷伊泰島中部及北部之日軍，刻已開始大反攻，遮斷該島北部沿岸公路，裏　附近之美軍刻已陷於孤立。日軍二十六日於摩羅泰島敵　登陸，展開熾烈戰，日軍航空隊更於雷伊泰島對美軍兵站基地，機場以及船舶，加以最大空襲，使之受重創。美方雷伊泰島前線消息，雖宣傳美軍依然制壓日軍，但因天氣地形等關係，已受重大障礙。同時，該方面日軍發揮最大戰力者，已爲敵方所公認，。例如二十九日之合眾社電訊，美軍第七師幹部將校中校開拉雷稱，吾等前方之日軍，實爲美軍過去遭遇敵軍中最優秀之强敵，彼等之作戰情形，實可謂理想軍隊之作戰。</p>
<h3>德防衛國土　構築要塞機　亞琛區德軍後撤</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　近兩日來西線亞琛區美第一第七兩軍之攻擊砲火已經轉弱，但就全部戰局觀之，反軸心軍鋒銳受强力阻止，唯大攻擊今仍勉强繼續進展中。關於反軸心軍之企圖侵入德國國境，德國防軍及人民襲擊隊等，對此莫不皆有拼死抵抗之決意。德國防當局亦正謀加强國境要塞，現已發表於東西南方各國境動員約百七十萬人，內中德國平民男女約四十萬，希特勒少年團十六萬五千名，德國勞動奉公隊，即准軍隊十二萬五千名，其他四萬七千名，外國勞動者百萬人，待此要塞完成後，恐反軸心軍無論持多大物力，想進德國一步，必難免受極重大之犧牲</p>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　德國社訊，據本社駐西線訪員稱：亞琛之北，美軍繼續展開在規模攻勢而侵入村莊二處，激戰後，德軍防線後撤數百　。亞琛之東南，格羅　赫特恨及伏桑勒克戰事，於與德軍有利局勢下結束。</p>
<h3>東線戰事焦點　移洪都南部　德軍退出貝克斯</h3>
<p>柏林一日中央社電　據海通社訊：特拉夫河多淄河合流處，貝克斯東南蘇軍之攻勢　已開始，蘇軍企圖突襲佔領貝克斯未遂，德軍已自該城撤退，以免被敵包圍。由巴爾幹撤退之德軍團進行順利，蘇軍急欲由特拉夫河以北向西進攻，戰爭焦點已移至布達佩斯以南，其東及東南則僅有局部戰事，密斯科爾　及埃格之戰事無變化。斯洛伐克之蘇軍已進抵恩格，對加士柯普萊索夫之壓力，依然未停止。杜克拉隘尚在德軍手中，自貝斯基特至波羅的海間，無大戰發生，柯　蘇軍似已暫時不攻德軍陣地。</p>
<h3>美在太平洋補給困難</h3>
<p>裏斯本一日中央社電　據芝加哥電，美海軍補給局長楊格，二十八發表演說，其大意謂：爲在南太平洋任何地點實行登陸作戰，若有二十五萬　之裝備，運搬登陸。又爲維持共兵力，至於三十日之長期間，更須繼續補給三十萬　之裝備，如此龐大之兵及裝備，仍須使用各種登陸舟艇，分别於五千處登陸，以上不過此種登陸作戰補給問題之一部而已，蓋於此遠地登陸作戰，即船舶本身亦須同時補給也，爲克服此種補給之困難，海軍方面已動員補給戰船。</p>
<h3>美國務院改組</h3>
<p>裏斯本一日中央社電　德國社訊，華盛頓息：美上院頃批准斯蒂　紐斯升任爲國務卿。又訊，據消息　通之美方人士稱，完全改組美國務院之提議，已交羅斯福總統考慮，聞聯美事務連絡局，外國經濟行政局，及商務股均將被裁併，其負責人或將辭職，此爲新國務　清理內部之第一部。</p>

<h3>台菲戰事勝利　益堅必勝信念　鹽田大尉發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本在滬陸海外三報道當局主持之聯合報道常會，昨日下午三時假匯中飯店舉行，計到艦隊報道部代表鹽田大尉，囑托林俊夫，坂爪精一郎，王炳南及劉鎭南等，即席由鹽田大尉就一年來大東亞戰爭中，給予敵美之重創，發表談話如次；</p>
<p>敵美盤隊瀕於潰滅</p>
<p>本月七日，爲大東亞戰爭三週年紀念日，迴顧三年來日軍殲敵戰况，愈振發堅定必勝信念，尤其在過去一年中，日軍已達成消耗敵戰力上之目的，並如台灣菲島之東方海面，展開猛烈決戰，此役決戰，實可謂最後一次之消耗戰。在菲島東方海面上，敵美艦隊已遭受慘重打擊，瀕於潰滅。在戰略上，日軍又消滅敵方空軍基地，此點殊爲明顯。再如一星期來，日本航空部隊速績猛勇出動擊敵，而敵方之來雙次數則逐見銳減，足證敵方之戰力低落。日海軍神風特別攻擊隊，以及日本之陸軍特別攻擊隊，舉世震驚，故作戰之必勝，實爲我人所掌握。</p>
<p>必勝信念　可分兩點</p>
<p>我人艦定必勝信念，可分兩點而言：（一）日軍之特殊精神絕對超優，（二）機械方面，日本亦較敵人爲優，故在如今之作戰中，當爲日本優勝無凝·惟敵方在此次敗戰之餘，預料今後當重振兵力及補充軍需，由茲關係，在海上作戰之主要目標，乃破壞敵方之運輸船，輕快船艇，及擊滅敵航空基地。如日軍之對摩羅泰島，塞班島，新幾內亞島，迭尼安島敵基地猛烈攻擊，此外並對敵航空母艦艦隊機動部隊之攻擊，凡一發覺敵艦踪跡，日軍即加以擊滅，我人已有充分之準備，突擊敵人。如上月二十九日之在雷伊泰島之陸上作戰隊，戰果赫赫，他如日本國民踴躍目願獻身於特別攻擊隊者，更使人振奮，並加强必勝信念，擁擠狀况，頓使當局深感無法安揷收納，我人瞻望前途，對必勝信念，益爲堅定。</p>
<p>雷島敵軍　補給截斷</p>
<p>頃日軍在雷伊泰島之主要目標，乃向西北方面來侵之敵方部隊會行包圍作戰，以截斷敵方之補給路綫，使敵最引起恐慌者，即補給綫之被截，是乃日軍最主要之目標。敵方爲掩護上陸部隊。不惜利用　羅泰島，新幾內亞島，作爲空軍基地，現已迭經日軍之更番攻擊，已慘燬不堪，尤以雷伊舉島之塔克羅班及塔拉克　兩機塲，亦經日軍數度轟炸，不能運用，故在雷伊泰島之陸上作戰，已爲日軍所勝。最近敵美之敗戰狀况，敵方所發表稱日益困難，屢受挫折，以過去塞班戰役之　耀情形相比，實具有深遠意味。故根據以上情形而觀，敵軍之援助在雷島之登陸大軍，必須强化塞班島等之茲地，及在渝之基地，企圖轟炸日本本土及中國重要地，此在事實上所迫不得已所採取之不擇手段，以擴充航空基地，即如最近壓力對東京之空襲，逐漸頻增，前昨兩日，敵又將少農飛機侵襲東京，盲目投彈，傷害民衆及小學校，且又赴靜岡郊外盲炸，毫無所損。查東京國民，向對防空訓練，奮發努力，故當空襲時，損害極　，是實爲發揮甚大之效果。惟須特別注意者，深望上海巿民，努力完成防空鐵壁。今後敵機對上海地區之侵襲，勢所難免，翼望上海民間防空，特別强化。</p>
<p>英國艦隊力量薄弱</p>
<p>又在印度洋之英國艦隊，其勢力雖有增加，但猶未能攻擊日本，英國海軍僅祗能在本國及地中海駐值，如至東亞作戰，深信勞師無功，不堪日本一擊。上月二十九日，英首相邱吉爾之向日本國民演說，無法判斷使德國屈服，故英國之對德猶束手無策，消滅日本更屬渺茫已極。尚有法國與義大利之兩國海軍力量，當爲薄弱，集中於地中海，故英國艦隊實不能單獨活勵，即如或中協助在菲之麥克活塞部隊作戰，在目前殊不克實現，我人無　顧慮。如最近美國有人言及英美聯合國正式作戰爲美國，日本之敵人亦美國，故以英國之實力，實非日本之敵。</p>

<p>本市警察局督察處調整人事，獎懲督察長室主任督察長姚家瑞氏，服務該局三十餘年，成績優良，足資倚畀，一再懇辭，業經照准，緬念前勞，應予嘉獎，遺缺由事務科科長兼獎懲督察長吳根源調任。又獎懲督察長長棟啓太郎調任該室副主任督察長兼第一督察區主任督察長，兼該處秘書獎懲督察長兼第五督察主任督察長王德林，調兼第四督察區主任督察長，視察科副科長彭志淸，調任獎懲督察長兼視察科科長，第一督察區主任督察長王受昌，調任獎懲督察長，事務科副科長陳冀聖，調任獎懲督察長兼事務科科長，調查科副科長辻勝格，調任調查科科長，第七督察區主任督察長楊懋榮，調任第二督察區主任督察長，視察科科長兼第四督察區主任督察長朱調笙，調任第五督察區主任督察長，第二督察區主任督察長程子卿，調任第六督察區主任督察長，第六督察區主任督察長崔永銓，調任第七督察區主任督察長，督察區調查科科長邵景範，調任總務處專員，上該各員，均已分別到差辦公。</p>

<h3>申報讀者助學金受助生　成續展覽會素描</h3>
<p>— 受助生樂天</p>
<p>初冬的季節，一切都帶着衰頹的氣象，街頭什景，尤其顯得　雜的情緒。我們一般淸寒的學生，部並不因此而畏怯，反而苦讀的精神，愈覺得奮發淬勵；即以申報此次舉辦「成績展覽」而言，當我奉到校長的通知；「凡申報讀者助學受助學生，至少有一件出品，參與展覽。」於是同學中的受助者，莫不欣然樂從，集中心力，製作一件能引起人家注目的成績，預備送到申報去。</p>
<p>據助學金辦事處方面消息：自開始籌備，將近一月，各大中小學六百餘校，四千餘受助學生，彙送成績者，達十分之八以上，內中以平時的成績居多，特製的作品較少，論件數總計在兩萬以上，即平均每人約六件，從審查以後，陳列者約佔十分之四。此次籌備，相當繁雜，特約各大學受助學生十餘人會同整理，編目，佈置等事。靑年會方面，贊助尤多，除免費借給圖書館爲會塲外，並派員帮同工作，尤見其服務社會之精神。</p>
<p>昨日爲開幕之期，各界來賓到會參觀者，極爲踴躍。靑年會二樓「成績展覽會」紅綾橫額應舞招展，入門便臨會塲，陳列順序，是先小學而初中，高中，以至專科，大學，曲折迴繞，別具匠心。每組成績，各有特長而五彩繽紛，琳瑯滿堂，目爲之眩，槪括而言，中小學組都文藝，美術，工藝，刺繡，雕刻之類；專科大學係各科系的論文，筆記，實騐報吿，調查統計，標本模型，及聲，光，化，電之屬；新奇作品，可說應有盡有。</p>
<p>此番展覽的成績，各有各的長處，我個人對各受助同學，深致欽敬，而自嘆勿如，良用歉然！其中最引人注目者，大學組如「約翰」建築系的健身房設計圖，「交通」學生所製新式飛機模型，「滬江」的建築設計圖案，「同德」的神經道模型及人體剖視圖，「華東」的動物骨骼標本，「大同」的串聯電燈裝置，「復旦」的建築圖案，「南通」農紡兩科的農作及織物標本，「美專」的西洋畫，此外工商學藝所製的鋼鐵工具，「廣慈」「中德」兩產科所繪製的圖表，俱稱上乘。還有「正養」高二施家訓繪製的地圖及美術字，非常精緻，以十七齡的靑年，能作如此工細圖案，前途豈可限量。其餘中小學作品，大都精彩，惜不能一一表而出之。</p>
<p>這裏我得代表受助同學，感謝申報當局及助學諸公，爲了我們四千餘淸寒學生，不知費了幾許精神與物質，辦理已經八屆的助學工作，雖然經費是社會各界的捐款，而申報方面審愼周詳，涓滴歸公，不浪費公款分文，這種奉公克已的精神，求諸海上善團，能有幾個？昨天起至月底止，申報又發動特別勸募，以一千隊爲目標，每隊至少兩萬元，倘能募足二千萬元，則我們四千餘淸寒學生，下學期才有繼續攻讀的機會。助金辦事處送會陳列的統計表，也有十餘種，對助學金各項工作，分析得非常淸晰。當初第一屆，每人平均發給助金只三十三元，而上屆平均數已升至三千零四十七元，四年以來，物價遞升的速度，眞令人驚駭！茫茫前途，不知將伊於胡底！我書至此，不寒而慄，眞所謂情不自禁的了。</p>
<h3>讀者助學消息　成績展覽會昨日開幕　來賓參觀中日不絕</h3>

<h3>Enemy Ships off Tacloban Bombed Fiercely by Kamikaze Units; Brave Warriors of the Yasukuni Flying Corps Complete Ramming Targets</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the afternoon of the 1st: The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Force fiercely attacked enemy transport ships off Tacloban on November 26th, sinking one large transport ship. Japanese air units sank one enemy transport ship in Leyte Bay on November 29th. On the 30th, they destroyed one transport ship east of Palau Island.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - The second squadron of the Japanese Yasukuni Flying Corps, Second Lieutenants Otsubo and Hata, along with six brave warriors, sank most of the known enemy warships. On the 29th, they perished together with their aircraft. When escort fighters penetrated enemy fighter formations, they engaged in fierce battles. Although the Japanese lost two aircraft, they ultimately led the six warriors to the skies above the enemy warships. The first squadron of the Yasukuni Flying Corps, consisting of four brave warriors, had previously perished in the Leyte Sea. Later, enemy ships were discovered, protected by battleships and cruisers. At that moment, the six aircraft piloted by the six warriors disbanded their formation and launched head-on attacks on their respective targets. Initially, one Japanese aircraft rammed an enemy battleship, followed by a second aircraft continuing the attack. The enemy battleship was immediately enveloped in smoke and fire, with flames soaring into the sky. The other four aircraft, not wanting to be outdone, successively rammed enemy ships. As a result, three large enemy transport ships exploded and sank one after another. Since its deployment, the Japanese Army Special Attack Force has sunk 22 enemy ships (including four battleships) with 30 aircraft.</p>
<p>Philippine Islands Japanese Base, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - In response to the ground battles on Leyte Island, Japanese air units have been launching heavy attacks on enemy ground forces for days. On the night of the 29th, Japanese army air units further mobilized to bomb and strafe enemy ground forces around the city of Carigara, inflicting significant damage. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announced Overall Results of Morotai Battle Yesterday; Air Units Conducted Intense Raids, Destroying Two Airfields</h3>

At the same time, they requested that he convey this intention to the Japanese Supreme Commander. Sukarno reported the ardent spirit of these youths at the Central Conference of the Javanese Dedication Society on the 29th, greatly inspiring the members of the society. During the meeting, he urged the general public to appreciate the enthusiasm of these youths. The sincerity of the suicide bombing force is comparable to that of the Japanese Special Attack Force, and it is sufficient to inspire the youth of the entire island with a surging spirit of determination and struggle. Only those who are willing to die can achieve victory and strive for the independence of Indonesia. This determination is now even more vigorously promoted in Indonesia.</p>

Mr. Wang devoted all his efforts to seeking the freedom and independence of China and the liberation of East Asia. It is truly regrettable that he passed away before this great cause was completed. I firmly believe that while Mr. Wang's physical body has passed, his spirit will endure. Now that Mr. Wang has passed, the Chinese people, especially those under the severe rule of the government in Chongqing, should awaken. Mr. Wang died for the sake of saving China and liberating East Asia. Although the greatest leader of China, Mr. Wang Jingwei, has passed away, his comrades Chen Gongbo, Zhou Fohai, and patriotic individuals will bravely move forward.

Finally, I wish all Chinese comrades to advance tirelessly.</p>

However, due to the high speed and intensity of the battle being conducted in the dark, the results could not be confirmed. Nevertheless, the Japanese side confirmed that they had sunk at least two large enemy ships, causing the enemy to tremble in fear.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Winter Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the westerly wind was piercingly cold, and the weather turned frigid. Everyone added warm clothes, but they still shivered and called out for warmth. However, let us close our eyes and imagine what will happen to our compatriots who have no warm clothes to add? This year, prices have unexpectedly continued to soar. Most poor families are without clothes or food, which is more widespread than in previous years. Those who are generally sleeping on the streets, struggling in the cold wind and howling, are even more miserable. How can we, who are fortunate enough to have warm clothes and full stomachs, not have sympathy and compassion for these compatriots?</p>
<p>The expression of sympathy and compassion is nothing more than donating what one can afford, giving clothes to those who have none, and providing congee to those who have no food. However, instead of doing this work in a piecemeal and fragmented way, it is better to do it in a centralized and holistic way, which is more universal and effective. In other words, it should be led and presided over by the government, raising funds, coordinating all efforts, and utilizing the skilled personnel of charitable organizations to carry out relief work. At the same time, the general public should donate what they can afford. Therefore, it is now an urgent time for the government to launch winter relief.</p>
<p>According to reliable information, the municipal government has decided to form a winter relief committee to handle this year's winter relief efforts. At the same time, this year's winter relief efforts have two noteworthy characteristics, which are gratifying. The first is sufficient funding. It is said that the authorities have decided on a relatively large amount of funding for winter relief and are confident in raising the funds. The second is sufficient personnel. It is said that the winter relief staff will be selected from the various charitable organizations in the city that have achieved relatively good results, temporarily transferring experienced personnel. Winter relief is an annual routine task, and this year's winter relief has these two characteristics, which are naturally more advanced than the winter relief efforts of previous years. Therefore, we also hope that influential members of society will fully cooperate to successfully complete this year's winter relief efforts and provide more assistance to impoverished compatriots.</p>
<p>The Municipal Advisory Committee of this city will hold a plenary committee meeting today. We request the members of the Advisory Committee to pay special attention to the work of winter relief this year and provide full opinions for the authorities to refer to. The members of the Advisory Committee have considerable status and prestige in society. At the same time, they also have practical experience in charitable work. We hope that they will discuss the most appropriate and practical solutions and suggest them to the authorities. We believe that the solutions decided upon by the Advisory Committee will be accepted by the authorities and trusted by the citizens. When appealing to citizens for cooperation, it will also be able to obtain the greatest response and effect.</p>
<p>Finally, while hoping that this year's winter relief work will proceed smoothly and that impoverished citizens will truly be relieved, we also have a few minor suggestions: The salaries of the staff and the office expenses should preferably not be paid from the relief funds, but by the government. All cotton cloth and rice used for relief should preferably be distributed by the rationing agencies, priced according to rationing prices, and not purchased on the black market, because black market prices are too high and lack standards, making it difficult to verify. The targets of relief should first be those who are sleeping on the streets without clothes or food. At the same time, taking advantage of the winter relief opportunity, these vagrants should be provided with shelter, or contact should be made with vagrant labor camps to send them to shelters. Secondly, there are those who are generally poor and also poor soldiers.</p>
<h3>Implementing Chairman Wang's Legacy; Letter from the Chinese Kuomintang to the People (4)</h3>
<p>China and Japan Should Urgently Support Each Other</p>
<p>"China and Japan are two great nations, bordering each other, and neighboring friendship is natural and necessary. Our Premier established the outline when creating the Chinese Revolutionary Alliance, advocating the great union of the people of China and Japan. During the sixth year of the European War, he published the book 'The Question of China's Survival,' clearly indicating that the relationship between Japan and China is related to survival and security. Without Japan, there is no China; without China, there is no Japan. To seek the long-term peace of both countries, no misunderstanding can exist between them." In the spring of the thirteenth year, when discussing the Three Principles of the People, he also pointed out the necessity of uniting China and Japan and the nations of Asia in the Principle of People's Rights. In the winter of that year, when he went north to Japan via the northern route, he gave a lecture on Pan-Asianism, repeatedly expressing his hope that Japan would assist China and abolish unequal treaties. He also asserted that the two great nations of China and Japan are the driving force behind the independence movement in Asia, and that there is a necessity for them to unite and struggle. Our Premier did not live to see the concrete realization of Sino-Japanese cooperation, but the fundamental policy had already been established. The purpose of the National Revolution is to seek freedom and equality for China. To seek freedom and equality for China, it is necessary to simultaneously seek the independent solution of Asia. To seek the independent solution of Asia, it is necessary to unite the oppressed nations of Asia to struggle together, especially the two great nations of China and Japan. The logic is very clear. Over the past few decades, the two sides have gone in opposite directions, and the accumulated problems have led to a deteriorating relationship between the two countries. The reason for this is that external seduction is one aspect, but internal differences have their own responsibilities. Reflecting on the past, it is necessary to deeply reflect on and clarify their respective responsibilities, respect and understand each other, in order to seek a reasonable solution, so as not to cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. The Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement of the twenty-first year and the Tanggu Ceasefire Agreement of the twenty-second year were all based on this purpose, hoping that after the cessation of military actions, the reversed relationship between the two countries could return to a good state. This effort had made relevant progress by the spring of the twenty-fourth year. On the Japanese side, the three major principles of diplomacy towards China were announced in the Imperial Diet. On the Chinese side, the fundamental policy of Sino-Japanese diplomacy was also declared at the Central Political Conference. Since there was such resonance between the two countries, there was no reason why this could not resolve disputes and promote the beginning of friendship. During this year, international affairs were brewing changes, and imperialists took advantage of the situation, implementing their indirect manipulation during the third period. As a result, there was a mistake in the Rose Agreement of Britain, and then in the instigation and provocation of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party, and the fundamental policy changed again and again. In February of the twenty-sixth year, although the Fifth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee of the Party still marked the policy of "seeking self-reliance internally and seeking coexistence externally," it recognized that to seek self-reliance internally, it was necessary to unite the people and pay attention to production and construction. To seek coexistence externally, it was necessary to follow the path of international peace to move forward, but the crisis was latent and imminent. The prevention of the matter beforehand failed to grasp the set policy, and the remedy after the event could not adapt to the times. Therefore, errors were made repeatedly, misled by the empty words of the British and Americans to come out and interfere within three months, leading to the Battle of Shanghai on August 13, which caused the war to extend from the Yellow River Basin to the north and south of the Yangtze River. Furthermore, due to the oppression of the Soviet Union and the threat of the Communist Party, the possible mediation could not be promoted, and a good opportunity was missed. In April of the twenty-seventh year, the Party's provisional declaration stated, "My wish is in peace, and our ultimate hope is still in peace," but the situation was rigid and the stalemate could not be broken, and the war continued. Afterwards, the country was increasingly in danger, and world affairs became more urgent. The country was filled with scorched earth and the wilderness with sorrow. At this point, the peace movement was like an arrow on the string and had to be launched. However, every time the peace movement entered a new stage, or when international affairs brewed a new change, our Chairman would painfully state the pros and cons and offer loyal advice to Chongqing, always hoping for a unified party and a unified country to seek unified peace together.</p>
<p>Deeply Hope to Work Together to Achieve Comprehensive Peace</p>
<p>On December 29th of the twenty-seventh year, our Chairman issued an advocating peace, which was based on this idea for what was suggested to Chongqing. In the autumn of the twenty-eighth year, after the Sixth National Congress of the Party, at the beginning of the German-Soviet War, followed by , he strongly stated that the hope of winning the war of resistance should not be placed on international assistance. The changes in the powerful countries are unpredictable, and the distant association and near attack of weak countries will only suffer from their misfortune. At this time of turmoil and shock, China and Japan should deeply combine and not put East Asia into this vortex. The expectation for Chongqing was also the same. In the spring of the twenty-ninth year, before the National Government returned to the capital, he again issued a , stating that "the foundation of the peace plan is already in place. What China can get is not only non-destructive conditions for the country, but also by following this path, China's independence and freedom can be guaranteed, and the construction of the Three Principles of the People can be achieved." "Only the realization of peace, the whole country is consistent, can be swift and universal." The issue of troop withdrawal is also the same principle, in order to prevent the national and civilian strength from being exhausted for a long time, it is imperative to "first devote all efforts to local peace, and still deeply hope to work together to achieve comprehensive peace as soon as possible." For those who have fallen, the responsibility is heavier and the expectations are thicker. In November of the same year, before the signing of the Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations, he again sent a message, "As the state of war still exists, the facts accompanying this state of war also have to be allowed to exist. This kind of pain cannot be completely eliminated until comprehensive peace is achieved. For this reason, it is essential not to delay, make a decision, and announce a ceasefire." This can be said to be the most sincere and candid advice. In the years that followed, in broadcasts, speeches, and various remarks, he deeply expressed his expectations for those who had fallen. In February of the thirtieth year, he launched the East Asian League Movement, revealing the four major outlines of political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication. On December 8th of the same year, the Pacific War broke out. The Sino-Japanese Incident was transformed into a war to defend East Asia, eliminating aggression and returning the opportunity for freedom. Our Chairman constantly called on Chongqing to pay attention, but the reason why he persevered was also to hope that each other would work together to break free from the shackles that had been placed on our heads for a century (to be continued).</p>

Such a huge amount of troops and equipment still require the use of various landing craft to land at 5,000 different locations.

<h3>Victory in the Taiwan and Philippine Battles Strengthens the Belief in Inevitable Victory; Captain Shiota Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>The Joint Press Conference held by the Allied Japan Shanghai Army, Navy, and Overseas Three News Authorities was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Hui Zhong Hotel. Captain Shiota, representing the Fleet News Department, and entrusted representatives Lin Junfu, Sakatsume Seiichiro, Wang Bingnan, and Liu Zhennan were present. Captain Shiota delivered a speech on the heavy damage inflicted on the enemy US in the Greater East Asia War over the past year. The speech was as follows:</p>
<p>Enemy US Fleet on the Verge of Collapse</p>
<p>The 7th of this month is the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Looking back on the war situation in which the Japanese army annihilated the enemy over the past three years, it further strengthens our firm belief in inevitable victory. Especially in the past year, the Japanese army has achieved the goal of depleting the enemy's combat power, and has launched fierce decisive battles in the eastern waters of Taiwan and the Philippines. This decisive battle can be said to be the last attrition war. In the eastern waters of the Philippines, the enemy US fleet has suffered heavy blows and is on the verge of collapse. Strategically, the Japanese army has also destroyed the enemy's air force bases, which is particularly evident. Furthermore, in the past week, the Japanese air force has continued to dispatch brave attacks against the enemy, while the number of enemy attacks has gradually decreased sharply, which proves the decline in the enemy's combat power. The Japanese Navy's Kamikaze Special Attack Force and the Japanese Army's Special Attack Force have shocked the world, so the inevitable victory of the war is in our hands.</p>
<p>Belief in Inevitable Victory Can Be Divided into Two Points</p>
<p>Our firm belief in inevitable victory can be divided into two points: (1) The unique spirit of the Japanese army is absolutely superior, and (2) In terms of machinery, Japan is also superior to the enemy. Therefore, in the current war, Japan is undoubtedly superior. However, in the wake of this defeat, the enemy is expected to rebuild its forces and replenish military supplies in the future. Due to this relationship, the main goals of naval warfare are to destroy the enemy's transport ships, light fast boats, and destroy enemy air bases. For example, the Japanese army's fierce attacks on enemy bases on Morotai Island, Saipan Island, New Guinea Island, and Tinian Island, in addition to attacks on the enemy's aircraft carrier fleet mobile units. Whenever enemy ships are detected, the Japanese army will annihilate them. We are fully prepared to attack the enemy. For example, the land combat team's achievements on Leyte Island on the 29th of last month were remarkable. The eagerness of the Japanese people to volunteer for the special attack force has further inspired and strengthened the belief in inevitable victory. The crowded situation has made the authorities feel deeply unable to accommodate and accept them. Looking forward to the future, our belief in inevitable victory is even more firm.</p>
<p>Enemy Supplies on Leyte Island Cut Off</p>
<p>The Japanese army's main goal on Leyte Island is to encircle the enemy troops invading from the northwest to cut off the enemy's supply lines. What the enemy fears most is the cutting off of supply lines, which is the Japanese army's most important goal. In order to cover the landing troops, the enemy does not hesitate to use Morotai Island and New Guinea Island as air bases. They have now been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese army and have been severely damaged. In particular, the Tacloban and Tarac airfields on Leyte Island have also been bombed by the Japanese army several times and cannot be used. Therefore, the Japanese army has won the land battle on Leyte Island. Recently, the enemy US has announced that the defeat situation is becoming increasingly difficult and has been repeatedly frustrated, which has far-reaching significance compared to the past glorious situation of the Saipan campaign. Therefore, based on the above situation, the enemy army's assistance to the landing forces on Leyte Island must strengthen the bases on Saipan Island and the base in Chongqing, attempting to bomb the Japanese mainland and important Chinese locations. This is a desperate measure taken out of necessity to expand air bases. For example, the recent pressure of air raids on Tokyo has gradually increased. In the past two days, the enemy sent a small number of planes to attack Tokyo, blindly dropping bombs, injuring civilians and elementary schools, and blindly bombing the suburbs of Shizuoka, causing no damage. The citizens of Tokyo have been working hard to train in air defense, so the damage during air raids is extremely , which has achieved great results. However, special attention must be paid to the hope that the citizens of Shanghai will work hard to complete the iron wall of air defense. In the future, enemy aircraft will inevitably invade the Shanghai area, and it is hoped that civil air defense in Shanghai will be particularly strengthened.</p>
<p>British Fleet Weak</p>
<p>The British fleet in the Indian Ocean has increased in strength, but it is still unable to attack Japan. The British Navy can only be stationed in its home country and the Mediterranean Sea. If it were to fight in East Asia, it is believed that it would be fruitless and unable to withstand a single blow from Japan. On the 29th of last month, British Prime Minister Churchill's speech to the Japanese people was unable to judge the surrender of Germany, so Britain is helpless against Germany, and eliminating Japan is even more remote. In addition, the naval forces of France and Italy are weak and concentrated in the Mediterranean Sea, so the British fleet cannot be active alone. If it were to assist the Macarthur forces in the Philippines, it would not be possible to achieve this at present, and we have no to worry. Recently, some Americans have said that the joint war between the United Kingdom and the United States is between the United States and Japan, and that the enemy of Japan is also the United States. Therefore, with the strength of the United Kingdom, it is not an enemy of Japan.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Fare Regulations; 15 Yuan Per Municipal Li</h3>
<p>Recently, the number of trams has decreased, and citizens mostly use rickshaws as a means of transportation. Rickshaw pullers take the opportunity to demand exorbitant fares without any standards. The Public Utilities Bureau has specially set the rickshaw fare at 15 yuan per municipal li. For example, the entire distance from Jing'an Temple to Zhongshan Park is 2,250 meters, which is equivalent to 4 and a half municipal li, and the fare should be 68 yuan. In the future, citizens taking rickshaws can pay the fare according to this standard.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Native Place Association Expands Small Loan Fund</h3>
<p>The Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Place Association, under the direction of Wu Yunzhai and Tang Shoumin, has established a clinic for providing medical care and medicine, a scholarship for impoverished students, and a small loan program. For several years, it has been supported by enthusiastic people and has promoted impartial fellow villagers to divide labor and cooperate, taking on welfare undertakings with remarkable results. Two years ago, Hu Chunlin, Chen Peide, Yao Hanbin, Chen Rongfa, and Zhou Daoqian were appointed to form a Small Loan Committee. For two years, borrowers have been able to repay the principal in accordance with the regulations. Recently, the cost of living has increased, and an increase in the amount of loans is necessary to meet the needs of those seeking assistance. Therefore, a fundraising campaign to expand the fund has been launched. Enthusiastic people have responded very enthusiastically to the call for donations. Donors are requested to send their donations directly to Zhou Daoqian of the association's Finance Section, who will issue a formal receipt. At the end of the year, the Lixin Accounting Firm will be invited to audit the accounts to ensure transparency.</p>

<h3>Sketches from the Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship Student Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>— A Scholarship Recipient, Lè Tiān (Happy Heaven)</p>
<p>In the early winter season, everything carries a sense of decline, and the street scenes especially appear filled with mixed emotions. We, the general impoverished students, are not intimidated by this; on the contrary, our spirit of diligent study becomes all the more determined. Take, for instance, this "Achievement Exhibition" organized by the Shên Pao. When I received the principal's notice, "All Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship recipients must submit at least one item to participate in the exhibition," all of us scholarship recipients were delighted to comply, concentrating our efforts to create a piece of work that would attract attention, ready to send it to the Shên Pao.</p>
<p>According to news from the scholarship office: since the beginning of preparations, nearly a month ago, over six hundred elementary, middle, and high schools, with over four thousand scholarship recipients, have submitted achievements, reaching more than eight out of ten. Among them, most are regular schoolwork, with fewer specially made works. In terms of the total number of items, there are more than twenty thousand, averaging about six items per person. After review, about four out of ten were displayed. The preparations for this event were quite complicated, with over ten scholarship students from various universities specially invited to assist with sorting, cataloging, and arranging things. The YMCA also provided a great deal of support, not only lending the library for free as the venue but also sending personnel to help with the work, truly demonstrating their spirit of service to society.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the opening day, and the guests from all walks of life who came to visit were very enthusiastic. At the YMCA's second-floor "Achievement Exhibition," the red silk banner fluttered vibrantly. Upon entering the venue, the displays were arranged in order, first elementary school, then junior high, high school, and finally specialized schools and universities, winding around with ingenuity. Each group of achievements had its own special features and was colorful and dazzling. To summarize, the elementary and middle school groups mostly consisted of literary, artistic, craft, embroidery, and carving works; the specialized school and university groups consisted of theses from various departments, notes, experimental reports, surveys and statistics, specimen models, and things related to sound, light, chemistry, and electricity. It could be said that all kinds of novel works were available.</p>
<p>The achievements on display each had their own strengths. I personally deeply admire all the scholarship students and humbly feel I cannot compare. Among the most eye-catching were the university group's "John" architecture department's gymnasium design drawings, the new-style airplane model made by "Jiaotong" students, the "Shanghai" architecture design patterns, the "Tongde" nerve tract model and human anatomical view, the "Huadong" animal bone specimens, the "Datong" series lighting installation, the "Fudan" architectural patterns, the agricultural and textile specimens from "Nantong" agricultural and textile departments, and the Western paintings from "Meizhuan." In addition, the steel tools made by the industrial arts institute and the charts drawn by the obstetrics departments of "Guangci" and "Zhongde" were all considered excellent. Also, Shi Jiaxun, a junior high student from "Zhengyang," drew a map and created artistic lettering, which were very exquisite. For a seventeen-year-old youth to be able to create such detailed patterns, his future is surely limitless. The rest of the elementary and middle school works were mostly wonderful, but unfortunately, I cannot list them all individually.</p>
<p>Here, I must represent the scholarship students in thanking the Shên Pao authorities and the scholarship benefactors for spending so much effort and resources on our four thousand-plus impoverished students, managing the scholarship work for eight sessions already. Although the funds are donations from all sectors of society, the Shên Pao is prudent and thorough, using every penny for public benefit and not wasting public funds. How many charitable organizations in Shanghai can be found with this spirit of public service and self-discipline? From yesterday until the end of the month, the Shên Pao is launching a special fundraising drive, aiming for one thousand teams, with each team raising at least twenty thousand yuan. If twenty million yuan can be raised, then our four thousand-plus impoverished students will have the opportunity to continue their studies next semester. The statistical tables sent by the scholarship office for display also number over ten, analyzing the various aspects of the scholarship work very clearly. In the first session, the average scholarship given to each person was only thirty-three yuan, while in the last session, the average number has risen to three thousand and forty-seven yuan. The rate at which prices have risen in the past four years is truly alarming! The vast future, I do not know where it will end! As I write this, I cannot help but shudder; it is truly a case of uncontrollable emotion.</p>
<h3>Reader's Scholarship News: Achievement Exhibition Opened Yesterday, Guests Visited Continuously, Morning to Night</h3>
<p>The Shên Pao Reader's Scholarship Office's achievement exhibition of scholarship students was grandly opened at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at nine o'clock yesterday morning. Guests from all walks of life, from morning till night, more than two thousand people, carefully examined the displays and were deeply interested. It is expected that the number of visitors today and tomorrow will be even more crowded. This newspaper hopes that social philanthropists and previous donors will all be able to attend and offer guidance, both to witness the achievements of impoverished students studying hard and to understand the profound significance of helping with education.</p>
<p>Sympathy from All Sectors for Special Fundraising</p>
<p>(1) A letter from the Shanghai Pencil Factory states: "Your newspaper's management of the Reader's Scholarship Fund benefits students greatly, providing relief to the poor and nurturing talent for society, which we deeply approve of. We will contribute our modest strength and present 50,000 yuan under the name of the 'Samsung Pencil Team,' which we ask you to accept." (2) Yao Junzhi of the Xin Xing Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote: "Having read in your newspaper the call for the Scholarship Fund to organize special fundraising teams, your enthusiasm is admirable. Our company, as a member of society, has witnessed the high prices and the severity of the problem of students dropping out of school. We feel great sympathy for your actions and hereby have our company undertake the 'Shēndé Wúxīn Dàbǔ Zhī Team' [Deeply Understand My Heart Tonic Team], donating 20,000 yuan to show our support and hoping that colleagues in the industry will respond and achieve success."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Scholarship Receipts: The China Art Gallery (visitors on the 28th, 29th, and 30th for three days) donated 7,998 yuan, 5,000 yuan from colleagues of the Xuri Lun [Rising Sun] Affairs Department, 2,400 yuan from an anonymous person (receipt number 7721), 1,000 yuan from Bu Pingzhe [One Who Is Uneasy], a native of Yangzhou, 200 yuan from Zhu Lingwu, 100 yuan from Ying Yongyu (Cong Da Nian's [Cong Danian] congratulatory message on his appointment as training director of the Zhejiang Provincial Industrial Bank). The total amount received was 16,698 yuan, leaving a balance of 6,747,815 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Eighth Shên Pao Increases Scholarship Funding and Additional Fundraising Teams</h3>
<p>Team 3: Samsung Pencil Team: 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 4: Ding Hui Kang Team: 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 5: Hongqiao Sanatorium Colleagues Team: 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 6: He Rongkun Team: 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 7: Hechang Canvas Company Team: 70,000 yuan</p>
<p>Team 8: Shēndé Wúxīn Bǔ Zhī Team [Deeply Understand My Heart Tonic Team]: 20,000 yuan</p>
<p>Total received above: 230,000 yuan, leaving a balance of 430,000 yuan</p>
<p>Our newspaper has established "Special Fundraising Teams" for the Scholarship Fund. Since the simplified rules were announced yesterday, the Shanghai Pencil Factory has been the first to respond, which is admirable. The stationery industry is deeply and significantly related to education and culture. We hope that fellow leaders in the stationery manufacturing industry will actively participate in the scholarship movement in order to achieve our grand aspirations.</p>
<p>Ding Hui Kang and the Hongqiao Sanatorium he manages each formed a team yesterday, showing admirable enthusiasm. The pharmaceutical magnate Man Junzhi also responded to the call. It is hoped that fellow Western medicine practitioners and renowned doctors will jointly pool their efforts and do their utmost to raise donations and recognize teams for our newspaper's scholarship efforts.</p>
