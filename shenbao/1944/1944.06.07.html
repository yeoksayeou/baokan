<p>社評</p>
<h3>國民總進軍</h3>
<p>日本翼政會於六月三日召開第三次臨時總會，通過國民總進軍議案，希望全國人民當茲戰局益趨緊張之際，應及早把握時機，立卽挺身於國民總進軍之第一綫，以期早日獲得勝利。阿部總裁說，在戰爭時期，雖一人之努力與否，亦足以影響國家的興亡，所以必須全國國民，悉數用於生產方面，然後能一舉而擊滅仇敵。翼政會是民間團體，翼政會的意見就是民衆的意見，翼政會的決議就是民衆決心的表示，這個決議當然發生最大的力量。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的目的，在求整個大東亞的解放。勝利早一天獲得，解放也就早一天完成。因此，凡在大東亞國內，所有國家的國民，都不能袖手旁觀，而要切實地協助。協助的熱心怎樣和協助力量的多少，就是決定大東亞戰爭勝利的主要因素。我們更可以說</p>
<p>目前的局勢，對國民本身講，應當貢獻一切力量於國家。戰事的勝利和失敗決定國家民族的生存和消滅，勝利的早日獲得可以使戰爭的痛苦早日解除，這是一般人所早巳明瞭了。可是，勝利決不是僥倖能够獲取的，特別是解放戰爭非得用全民族的力量共同奮鬥，決計不能成功的。爲了保持已往剝削的權益起見，敵人必須用死力來和我們爭鬥，我們自然也只有用死力來打擊他們。現在不是吝惜氣力的時間，現在正是拼命的時間，現在能用的力量早些，多些，將來享受的安樂自然長些，大些。</p>
<p>對政府方面講，應當怎樣利用國民的力量而集中起來，國民有出力的決心，政府就當給國民以出力的機會，更要把這些力量組織起來，成為一個偉大的結晶力，所謂上下一心，就是這樣做法。團結國民的力量是戰時政府雖一的工作，國民的力量不能團結，戰爭必定不能够勝利，政府不能够團結國民</p>
<p>大東亞國內所有國家的國民們，要自動的立刻重獻整個的力量；大東亞國內所有國家的政府要誠意的立刻集中全部國民的力量，這是國民黨進軍的意義，這是獲取勝利的唯一途徑。</p>
<h3>哥希馬附近地區日軍作反復廳襲　粉碎敵突破企圖確保全綫</h3>
<p>仰光六日中央社電　印度戰綫之敵軍，為謀打通哥希馬至伊姆法爾公路，解除第一綫補給之困難及切斷日方補給綱，自五月底以來，如以優勢之繼被及約四千之兵力，猛攻哥希馬北方之高地。但爲該地一帶之日軍予以反復奇襲後，其主力即被擊退。是役敵棄屍一百五十具，但敵軍一部三百人，仍利用該地一帶之濃霧，進抵日軍陳地及日軍陣地之附近地帶　力謀突破該戰綫，日軍對此刻正繼續猛攻中。另一方面，日軍別動部則對進迫哥希馬西南方阿拉加拉高地日軍陣地之敵軍施行夜襲，將其完全擊退，又在七五二二高地方面，亦有敵軍五百人着着蠢動，全圖突破日軍陣地，而由於日軍先發制人之攻擊，敵軍之企圖即巳被挫，棄屍一百具後，即行潰走。但渝軍仍謀突破日軍陣地及遮斷日軍後方補給綫，刻正反復反擊，並藉空軍挺身隊之空中捕給，繼續推進遊擊戰。但担任補給綫之警備之日軍，業將敵軍此種企圖完全粉碎，而確保全綫，對敵之反擊巳有萬全之準備。</p>
<p>怒江方面激戰</p>
<p>仰光六日社電　渝軍渡過怒江後，企圖在雨季到，將怒江把握，日軍各精銳部隊，則先發制人，展開電擊作戰，予渝舉以殲減打擊，刻渝軍正積極整理戰綫中。六月一日，該方面渝軍復以空中補給及增援兵力前來反攻，日軍即於各戰綫反擊之，隨處與渝第六軍主力交戰，連日正展開　滅戰。又渝第五址三軍第一百一十六師，曾來襲大塘子，其第一百二十師曾來襲江沮街方面，日軍現正於雨中與渝軍激戰中。北冷水溝方面，渝第五十四軍第一師，曾試行奪回瓦甸街，當為日軍包圍，今已向高黎貢山脈以東潰走。又渝軍一營，貴於二日企圖自　人糯南側占渡河點，巳被日軍擊潰。茲將自五日初旬迄月末止，判明之怒江作戰綜含戰果錄次：渝軍棄屍三千餘具，被俘八十二人，日革鹵獲迫擊砲一六門，輕重機槍七十五，步槍四一二及其他衣料彈藥甚多。</p>
<h3>北千島方面防務要塞化　日潛艇活躍太平洋</h3>
<p>東京大日中央社電乃敵美窺視日本本土反攻路綫中之最近距離戰略要地，故北千島之要塞化，不僅日本即敵美亦頗重視，該地日軍某參謀特就此事談述如次：鎭護皇國第一綫之北千島，刻已成為要塞，南方前綫拉巴爾，由於日軍之不眠不休，得以堅强守護，而吾人並以最大決心，鎭　北方第一綫。相信覆滅神州之敵美一旦侵犯此處，則彼等必遭殲減之打擊。</p>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日潛艇在太平洋所獲之戰果，頗受世人之稱贊，雖水上艦挺空軍機隊所不能達成者，潛艇則能不辱使命完成任務。本平洋戰局現己日趨激烈，日潛艇之到處活躍，實前所未有。敵雖聲傳菲律賓上陸作戰，空襲日本本土，切斷日本與南方之連絡等誇大言詞，然日潛艇只稍事活躍，敵之野心瞬間即被粉碎。於日潛艇活躍下，敵補給路綫已頓形脆弱，最近尼米資會謂，如日軍戰綫縮短，但日潛艇給予吾人之威脅將更為重大，由此敵美對日潛艇威脅所感之恐懼，已可想而知。現敵美太平洋各防守島嶼以及美本土，均在日潛艇活躍範圍内，利用隱密性攻擊敵人，爲潛艇特點。於潛航中，敵特型航空母艦尤爲攻擊之最好目標，潛挺之積極任務，在攻擊主力艦，破壞補給路，實施奇製作戰，以及偵察哨戒綱，何時何地均能予敵人有極大威脅。</p>
<h3>行政院會議</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　行政院六日舉行二一二次會議，討論事項，院長呈准上海特別市政府者，以契紙售價不敷印製工本，擬將每張契紙改售三十元，轉請複示等情，當以事關變更契紙法定價格，經光飭由本院秘書處擬具修正契稅條文草案，請全決案，決議通過，呈中央政治委員會。任免事項，院長提，准軍事委員會函，擬諸任命項致莊兼陸軍第十二軍中將軍長案，決議通過，餘略。</p>
<h3>京市府將公布　食米臨時辦法</h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電　近來米價呈空前狂潑，影響市民生計至重且鉅，一般升斗小民，更有朝不保夕之虞，故市民對市當局對米糧准許自由買賣後之處置辦法，甚為關注與期待。茲悉市府經連日與有關機關磋商結果，巳擬定南京市民食米臨時處置辦法，日內即可公布。</p>

<h3>宣揚盟邦　海軍戰力　鄂舉行展覽會　　漢口六日中央社電　省宣傳處爲宣揚盟邦海軍之戰力，確立民衆之自信心與必勝之理念，昨起在省立女中舉行慶覽會，內容有各種畫片，東鄕。山本，古寶三元帥之遺像及盟邦海軍之誰姿等名貴照片，各界前往觀覽者絡繹不絕，情緒極為報烈，今日繼續展覽，定明日結束。緬甸北部　戰局的眞相  福仁　　大家都知道，打開緬甸公路，乃渝政權最大的要求。美國也以打通該公路爲西南亞洲戰場上最大的作戰且標，而費了很大的力量。這重慶興美國變力的必然要求，使他們推行非常無理的戰事。這當貴溪谷的建設萊杜公路，空中挺身嚴向如薩及莫寗的降落作戰，或突入密芝那，怒江渡河作戰等，凡此各項戰役，都是忽視戰略上常識的胡鬧戰事。這些冒險，似乎很適合美國人的嗜好，並目也符合重慶的必然要求，因而其宣傳價値，估計很高。但無理的戰事，終究無成功的可能，　渝聯合軍的運命，其給果正不啻自掘墳墓者，其原因就在於他們的冒險作戰。　　美渝聯合軍在寗芝那的一角發動，在五月十八日。這冒險作戰使反軸心陣綫　俗寡欲狂。但現實的戰關狀況，不興實傳的速力相一致。因日革頑強抵抗，遲遲不進，六月二日東南亞洲司令部的發表，也承認雖從三面攻擊市街，但並未占領到一半。從五月十八日起至六月二日止的十五日內，何以本能完全占領並不很廣的密芝那市呢？在日軍小部隊的頑强抵抗之前，這十五日的寶貴時間，讀日軍得到了使緬甸北部戰局逆轉的餘裕。日軍精銳大隊迅速集中於密芝那市的周圍取攻擊態勢。另在八莫區域的日軍部隊，亦一直綫北上，直衝侵入密芝那市的四千餘美渝軍之背後，截斷其道路。另一部隊取與此完合不同的路程，從密芝那西方地區沿軸甸鐵道南下，殲滅在莫康附近截斷鐵這的倫頓將軍部下的空挺隊，使鐵道通行無阻。變天之前起，該鐵道巳成爲密芝那附近大隊日軍的兵站補充綫，活發　進。且這鐵道沿綫的掃蕩部隊，又乘其餘勢，獲得另一戰果。那就是在英寗區域降落蠢動的空挺隊，以進迫加塲印區域日軍背後的企圖而北上，被日軍在印杜互基湖東而截住，加以猛攻後，究全繫減之。　　以加瑪印爲基點，在東西佈置了堅强陣地的日軍，對在富貴溪谷建築乘杜公路而南下至加瑪印區域的美渝軍主力部隊，嚴予監視，不容其前進一步。日軍另一部隊，乘此兩方對陳的樂會，從印杜亙基湖附近向西繞道，並迅即轉師北指，繞至加瑪印區域美渝軍的背後。在溪谷地帶，前有大軍擋路，後面退路被敵，他們可走的運命，也就不言而喻了。　　如上所述，日軍的活動，最近極爲活躍。巧妙的戰術，將緬甸北部戰局　至有利地位，並　成了各個擊破的戰略態勢。且雨季巳臨，美渝軍唯一依靠的空中補給，殆福困難。在密芝那陷於孤立的美渝軍，竟至於哀求「派遣增技服隊，超輸物資彈藥。」沉醉於邊去數週問局部的勝利而大事宣傳的美渝軍，幾天之內已由日軍掌握戰局的主動性，待等注意時，已發覺陷於不能動彈的重圍中了。他們的無理作戰的結果，造成了自我淸算的運命。華中鐵道公司　調整旅客車　今日起一部暫予停開　　南京六日中央社電　負有完成大東亞戰爭任務之華中鐵道公司，爲適應戰時體制，增强戰時輸送力起見，特依據關係當局之命令，於本月七日起，將現行之旅各列率重予調整，聞此次除將不必要之京滬綫臥車廢止，而增添客車，以應目前之需要外，並將一部份之客車暫予停止，預料華中鐵道公司此項措置實施後，今後對於軍事上及經濟上將有莫大之貢獻。茲將本月本日起暫予停止之客車開列於後：　　京滬綫　　上海間對開之快車，　無錫開往南京及南嘉開往無錫之慢車，　上海開往蘇州及蘇州開往上海之慢軍。　　滬柿綫　　上海　開往杭州及杭州開往上海之　軍。　　松滬綫　　　上海　至砲台灣，由上海開八時十二分，十一時二十五分，下午二時三十分，下午六時十八分，下午七時五十五分。　由砲台灣開，九時五十分，十二時五十五分，下午三時三十七分，下午七時四十五分，下午十一時五分。　上海至新興，由上海開，五時五十分，下午三時三十五分，由新興開，六時三十分，下午四時三十分。　　南京城　　內綫、由下關開，五時正，八時三十五分，十二時正，下午二時三十五分，下午七時四十五分，下午十時四十分。由中華門開，下午一時二十五分，下午三時五十分，下午十時正。下午十一時五十五分，由新國民開六時另六分，九時三十五分。　　津浦綫　　　浦口開往天津及天津開往浦口之慢事，但徐州天津問仍照常行駛。　　（又訊）華中鐵道公司當局，聽於上項實施後，爲避免旅客擁擠起見，深盼旅客方面如非萬不得已時，儘量减少旅行，以免無謂之擠軋，而妨碍　時運輸體制。徐開遊藝書慰勞敎師　　徐州六日中央社電　大日敎師筋，本市敎育分會下午舉行慰勞敎師遊藝大會，招待各界參觀。東聯中國總會淮海省分會亦舉行茶話會，函請各關係機關並各校敎員參加。共同檢討現階段我國敎育重點及如何完成劃時代敎育使命等問題。晚間更有電影大會。日軍以武士見地為李家鈺樹基碑　　鄧州六日中央社電　於大營（陝州下方）南方南寺院附近，遭日軍奇變　而被擊潰之第三十六集團司令部，其高級幹部多數或戰死或　俘虜，一時傳稱生死不明之集團軍長李家鈺，現已於日軍收容之屍體中發現，確認業巳戰死。又重傷後死亡之副官長周鼎銘屍體，亦被發現，日軍以武土見地，即於其戰死之地予以掩埋，同時建立墓碑，對無意識之抗戰陣亡敵將靈魂。予以甚大安慰。現於南寺院附近臉塲上巳樹立闊七尺之墓碑，上書「第三十大集團軍總司令陸軍上將李家鈺之靈，昭和十九年民三十三年五月二十九日日本軍建立一，碑前供具鮮花滿地，李將軍之棺，係某部隊長用汽車由遠道運來者。於廣關之麥田中，周少將之墓碑，亦遙遙　立，上書「第三十六集團軍總司令部陸軍少將局　銘之靈」。法國西北海岸發動登陸戰　諾曼第半島激戰中　　柏林六日中央社急　電德軍當局六日公布：期待已久之反軸心侵犯西歐海岸戰役，巳於今日淸晨發動，敵方以空戰部隊在塞納　區開始登陸，哈佛港現在敵方猛烈砲火轟擊之下，而德海軍則在港外海面與登陸艦艇作戰。　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局六日發表：英軍降落傘部隊，在諾壘第半鳥登陸後，會遭德軍掃蕩。　　柏林六日央社急電　德國社訊：據偵察報吿，法西岸塞納灣與諾曼第之西岸章，有無數反軸心登陸用船舶及輕型海軍船艇，英美軍本日淸晨於舉納　區開始以空輸部隊登陸，而敵方張力轟炸機隊周時對加萊·　扣克兩區施行轟炸，德高射砲火立即迎擊。　　英相宣布進攻歐陸　　瑞典京城六日中央社電　據海通社訊、英首相邱吉爾今晨向下院宣稱：包括船舶四千艘以上及小船數千艘之艦隊，於昨夜及今日淸晨向法國海岸行駛，開始進攻歐陸，並有第一繼飛獲約一萬一千架，可以隨時出動協助作戰。　　瑞典京城六日中央社電　據倫敦電，反軸革司令部六日發表：反軸心海軍己在艾森霍華指揮下，由有力空軍施護，於六日晨開始在法國西岸登陸，蒙高茂萊將軍刻指揮登陸部隊作戰。又陸軍部隊乃由英加軍及美軍編成者　　登陸部隊獲得增援　柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：關於反軸心海軍及飛機運輸兵之數量，據聞至少有英美傘兵及飛機運輸部隊四師團，參加哈佛港至　堡間之作戰，其他巳登陸之敵軍侵入昻尼河河口，已被籌後備兵於反攻時殲滅大半。美傘兵之活動權限於諾曼第地區。　　柏林六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，本社綜合各方報吿如下：　今晨英美軍之侵攻法西岸塞納河及諾曼第，乃一大規模之戰事，不能與登陸突襲隊相提並諭，其目的顯欲利用法西北部沿岸各河口建立據點，以使更多之衝擊部隊登陸。　刻下激戰之焦點，乃在克安地區，（法西北部塞納灣）德軍刻正於該區與侵歐軍作戰。　塞納河地區之敵軍巳於今日淸晨獲得增援部隊　　英美使用人形炸彈　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局發表稱：反軸心軍於哈佛附近投下之降落傘都隊，其中之一部乃爲穿董反軸心軍服之人形炸彈，若誤觸其體，立即猛烈爆炸，　　柏林六日中央社電　據巴黎所得消息：德國及反軸心空軍，刻正於杜佛海峽之加萊及鄧扣克上空展開熾烈空職。　　德軍準備一决雌雄　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局宣稱：反軸心軍此次作戰，是否果能發展為正式之登陸戰，仍須靜觀今後之推移。此次作戰非義戰綫可比，德軍將以不劣於敵方之物力條件，與敵一決雌雄。　　防御傘兵佈置週密　　柏林六日中央社電　海通社軍事特派員柯煦由羅美爾上將之司令部報吿稱：彼嘗視察防務工程，有喬裝僞飾妙不可言者，如空曠之地，各處植有死樹榦數萬株，若不臨近細察，難辨樹之眞僞，各樹榦成有鐵絲連緊，每一樹榦成為一鐵絲綱之中心，由空降落之傘兵有為鐵絲　困之處。又復見各處有地雷與樹幹運屬，有高懸樹梢，亦有低置地上者，設防之周密，幾如天羅地綱焉。治運工程局長殷汝耕准辭　明令特派徐邦榮繼任　　南京十六日中央社電　繼民政府令（六月六日）：治理運河工　局局長設汝耕，呈請辭職，情詞　切，准免本職，此令。特派徐邦榮為治理運河工程局局長，此令，主席汪兆銘兼行政　院長汪兆銘。義戰事焦點移羅馬西北　德軍佈就堅强陣地　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局發表撤退羅馬後之戰況如次：反軸心雖已於四日夜佔領羅馬，但其後德軍仍織續與之展開激戰。現戰局之焦點，巳置於羅馬西北地區及薩比那山脈南方。　　里斯本六日中央社電　維希電台五日廣播稱：義戰綫中部之戰鬥復行展開，紐西闌軍向聖古羅河上游進擊中。反軸心軍於此次新作戰，展開對義大利全綫之攻勢。　　柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：德軍今在羅馬西北·北面·及東北，佈就堅强之威脅網，控制羅馬四郊，阻其打通其他出路。　　柏林六日中央社電　德軍當局頃宣稱：德軍主力自羅馬近郊撒退後，已集結於基貝爾河北岸。　　放棄羅馬德方見解　　柏林六日中央社電　海通社訊：德政府情報處副處長孫德曼，昨日向外藉記者闡述德軍退出羅馬之政治意議，可視爲德國政府之見解。渠謂，德軍爲使羅馬避免戰禍，撤退時　道城外，實大有利於及軸心軍，故此次德軍退出羅馬，實非反軸心軍之軍事勝利。羅馬雖爲德軍之給養中心，同時羅馬民食之供　，亦爲德國之重負。反軸心軍進入羅罰之一日吿中，述德軍爲使羅馬避免戰禍，巳實踐反軸心之要求。並稱，「德國視文化重於軍事，」而亞歷山大將軍於六月二日則力言迅速進軍穿過羅馬，明示其不視羅馬爲不設防城市之意向。義大利國王宣佈遜位　　日內瓦六日中央社電　據德國社引紐約訊：那不勒斯反軸心大本營宣布，義王愛麥處限三世已於昨夜　署遜位詔，將其政權移交巴特里奧政府。　　法義停戰協定撤銷　　阿姆斯特丹六日中央社電　德國社訊：巴特里奧已將一九四〇年所簽訂之法義停戰協定撤銷。特戈爾正在倫敦會商軍事問題　　瑞典京城六日中央社電　海通社訊，倫敦消息：特戈爾將軍到達倫敦後，巳與英首相邱吉爾及攻歐反軸心軍總司令艾森霍華將軍舉行軍事會議，討論軍事問題。</h3>

<p>Burma Northern Front: The Truth of the Battle Situation</p>
<p>Fu Ren</p>
<p>As everyone knows, opening the Burma Road is the greatest demand of the Chongqing regime. The United States has also considered opening this road as the biggest operation and objective in the Southwest Asian theater, and has put in great effort. This inevitable demand of Chongqing and the exertion of American power has led them to carry out extremely unreasonable battles. These include the construction of the Ledo Road in the Hukawng Valley, the airborne landing operations toward Sumprabum and Myitkyina, and the crossing of the Nu River, all of which are reckless military actions that disregard strategic common sense. These adventures seem well-suited to the American taste and also meet the inevitable demands of Chongqing, and therefore their propaganda value is estimated to be high. However, unreasonable battles ultimately have no chance of success. The fate of the Chongqing Allied forces is no different than digging their own graves. The reason lies in their adventurous tactics.</p>
<p>The US-Chongqing Allied forces launched an offensive in a corner of Myitkyina on May 18th. This adventurous battle caused the anti-Axis front to become frenzied. However, the actual battle situation did not match the speed of the propaganda. Due to the stubborn resistance of the Japanese army, progress was slow. On June 2nd, the Southeast Asia Command's announcement also admitted that although they were attacking the city from three sides, they had not occupied even half of it. From May 18th to June 2nd, within fifteen days, why were they unable to completely occupy the not-very-large city of Myitkyina? In the face of the tenacious resistance of a small Japanese force, these fifteen days of precious time allowed the Japanese army to gain enough leeway to reverse the situation in northern Burma. Elite Japanese troops quickly concentrated around Myitkyina and assumed an offensive posture. Meanwhile, Japanese units in the Bhamo area moved directly north in a straight line, directly attacking the rear of the 4,000+ US-Chongqing troops that had invaded Myitkyina, cutting off their route. Another unit took a completely different route, moving south along the Burmese railway from the western area of Myitkyina, annihilating the airborne troops under General Lentaigne who had cut off the railway near Mawlu, allowing the railway to operate unimpeded. Before the rainy season began, this railway had already become the supply line for the large Japanese force near Myitkyina, operating actively. Moreover, the mopping-up units along this railway took advantage of the momentum and achieved another victory. That is, the airborne troops who landed and stirred up trouble in the Indaw area, intending to advance towards the rear of the Japanese forces in the Kamaing-Imphal area, were intercepted by the Japanese army east of Lake Indawgyi, and after a fierce attack, were ultimately completely annihilated.</p>
<p>Using Kamaing as a base, the Japanese army, having established strong positions in the east and west, strictly monitored the main US-Chongqing forces that were building the Ledo Road in the Hukawng Valley and moving south towards the Kamaing area, not allowing them to advance a single step. Another Japanese unit, taking advantage of the stalemate between the two sides, detoured west from the vicinity of Lake Indawgyi and quickly turned north, circling around to the rear of the US-Chongqing forces in the Kamaing area. In the valley area, with a large army blocking the front and the retreat route cut off by the enemy, their fate is self-evident.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the recent activities of the Japanese army have been extremely active. Skillful tactics have turned the battle situation in northern Burma into a favorable position and have created a strategic posture of defeating the enemy one by one. Moreover, the rainy season has already arrived, and the air supply, on which the US-Chongqing forces solely rely, is becoming difficult. The US-Chongqing forces isolated in Myitkyina are even begging for "the dispatch of reinforcements and the delivery of supplies and ammunition." The US-Chongqing forces, who were intoxicated with the local victories in the past few weeks and made great publicity about it, have had the initiative in the battle situation seized by the Japanese army within a few days, and when they paid attention, they had already discovered that they were trapped in an unmovable encirclement. The result of their unreasonable military actions has created a fate of self-liquidation.</p>

Each tree trunk is connected tightly by barbed wire, each trunk becoming the center of a barbed wire network, so that paratroopers descending from the air will be entangled by the wire. He also saw mines linked to tree trunks everywhere, some hanging high in the treetops, and others placed low on the ground. The comprehensiveness of the defenses is almost like a dragnet.</p>

<p>German Perspective on Abandoning Rome</p>
<p>Berlin, June 6th, Central News Agency Telegram: Reuters reports that Sonneman, Deputy Director of the German Government Information Office, explained the political significance of the German army's withdrawal from Rome to foreign journalists yesterday, which can be regarded as the view of the German government. He said that in order to save Rome from the ravages of war, the German army retreated to the outside of the city, which is greatly beneficial to the Axis forces. Therefore, the German army's withdrawal from Rome is not a military victory for the anti-Axis forces. Although Rome is a supply center for the German army, at the same time, providing food for the people of Rome is also a heavy burden for Germany. In one of the announcements on the day the anti-Axis forces entered Rome, it was stated that the German army had fulfilled the anti-Axis forces' request in order to save Rome from the ravages of war, and claimed that "Germany values culture more than military affairs."

<p>Maeda's Address</p>
<p>Since ancient times, any maritime nation with a robust and strong navy and merchant fleet will have its national prestige spread throughout the seas. The Chinese Navy is still in its founding era, but under the alliance and participation in the war with our country, it is striving to build itself. I dare to say that for the future of East Asia, there is strong confidence.</p>
<p>The navy and the merchant fleet are like two wheels. They cannot exert their full power unless they develop in tandem. Especially during wartime, one can think of the importance of transportation. I believe that the establishment of an organization to train seamen here, and the education of naval training soldiers in the same place, has profound significance. Your responsibilities are very heavy. The responsibility for China's maritime defense and overseas development rests on your shoulders. I hope that whether you are studying or not, you must cultivate and hone yourselves, strive to cultivate the military spirit, and temper the naval soul. Each of you should guard your position and strive for progress, so as to contribute to China.</p>
<p>Leading Figures in Industry and Commerce Host Banquet for Mayor Chen</p>
<p>Over fifty-five leading figures in Shanghai's industry and commerce, including Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Tang Taomin, Dai Kuilu, Wu Zhenxiu, Guo Shun, Ye Fujie, Zhao Jinqing, Ju Zhijun, Xiang Kangyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhu Boquan, Jiang Shangda, Wang Boyuan, and Pei Yunqing, hosted a banquet at the French Club yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to express their respect for Mayor Chen, who was recently appointed Chairman of the National Government and has been extremely hardworking. They also invited the heads of various bureaus and departments of the municipal government. During the banquet, Lin Kanghou delivered a speech on behalf of the group, and the Mayor responded, creating a cheerful and enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Speech</p>
<p>He briefly stated that he was very grateful for the hospitality of the members of the industrial and commercial community towards the colleagues of the municipal government. Recalling the beginning of the National Government's return to the capital, it was not established solely on the will of a few people, nor was it solely negotiating with Japan based on the status of a few people. It was based on an assessment of the objective situation that the formation of a government was necessary to promote overall peace. Knowing that the obstacles to peace cannot be removed overnight, we will spare no effort to do what should be done. This belief has remained firm and unwavering for the past four years, and will continue to be so in the future. However, the work of peace and nation-building cannot be completed by the efforts of the government alone. You are the leaders of the industrial and commercial community, and also the outstanding members of the nation. I sincerely hope that you will work diligently. I firmly believe that if peace in China is achieved, it will guarantee peace in East Asia, and even world peace. The National Government has no other purpose than to promote overall peace. Shanghai is the heart of the country, and Nanjing is the brain. There should be a close connection between the heart and the brain. Moreover, Shanghai is the economic center. If the Shanghai problem can be solved, then more than half of the China problem will be solved. When I took office as the mayor of Shanghai, it was during a time of chaos. I knew my responsibilities were heavy, and I could not shirk them, so I diligently devoted myself to the task. Until now, the difficulties and obstacles have been such that even if I can excuse myself, you can also understand. But I fear that history will not forgive me, so I am even more determined to devote myself to the task. What is gratifying is that the concessions have been recovered, and administration has been unified. Although there are still some problems, in fact, there are no restrictions from treaties. Just as a contract of sale has been canceled, how to be independent and autonomous depends on our own efforts. Whenever I think of this, I deeply hope that the leaders of our industrial and commercial community will cooperate sincerely, so that with united wills we can build a fortress. If we do it, we will surely succeed. If we do not, we will surely fail. I am only using the positions of the National Government and the Municipal Government to express the above beliefs to you, and to thank you for your warm hospitality.</p>
<p>Dr. Sasaki Returns to Shanghai, Expresses Impressions of His Trip to Beijing: Chinese Agriculture Needs Scientific Methods</p>
<p>Japanese agricultural authority Dr. Sasaki, who came to China to serve as a lecturer for the "Wartime Agricultural Technology Lecture Series," has made several speeches and held seminars in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places in recent days, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that he returned to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago. A reporter visited him yesterday and met with the doctor, who shared his impressions of the trip as follows:</p>
<p>"This time, I stayed in Beijing for about a week. In addition to giving two lectures at National Central University and one lecture at the Jianshe Agricultural College, I also held a seminar with agricultural figures in Beijing. In addition to contributing some of my views on China's agricultural problems, I was able to hear valuable insights from all walks of life and exchange ideas. We were all very enthusiastic about discussing issues such as the future development of Chinese agriculture and the promotion of the production increase movement. I have always been very interested in China's agricultural problems. When I worked as a teacher at Peking University in the 28th and 29th years of the Republic of China, I also conducted research on Chinese agricultural problems. I am very happy to be able to come to China again this time and hold a seminar with old friends and others in Beijing. Furthermore, I discussed the issue of agricultural production increase with Minister of Industry Chen Junlian and economic advisor Dr. Nasu for a long time. I deeply feel that China is uniquely endowed by nature and rich in resources. If we can use scientific methods to improve agricultural and animal products as much as possible in the future, the prospects are truly unlimited. Secondly, I visited the Nanjing Central Agricultural Experiment Station farm. On the way back, I visited Mr. Yan Qingxiang's New Suzhou Farm and suburban sheep farms, etc. The impression I got was quite good. China, like Japan, is based on agriculture, and there are many similarities. If we can improve the shortcomings in agriculture and devote ourselves to the production increase movement in the future, not only can China become rich and strong, but it can also cooperate with Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<p>Reported at 7 O'Clock Yesterday, Minister Deibuchi Elaborated on the New Guinea and India-Burma War Situation: The Japanese Army is Exerting its True Combat Power</p>
<p>Minister Deibuchi of the Shanghai Japanese Army Reporting Department elaborated on the war situation in New Guinea and India-Burma at a reception for Chinese news reporters on the 6th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>When the US military landed on Biak Island in western New Guinea on May 27, Navy Day, US General MacArthur boasted that the operation in New Guinea was in fact over and made exaggerated claims that since the counterattack on Guadalcanal, the Japanese army had been defeated in the southwestern Pacific by about 250,000 troops, rendering them unable to fight again.</p>
<p>Fabricated Propaganda Collapses Without Attack</p>
<p>A week after the landing, the US military stated that they only occupied one corner and claimed that they were still continuing the fierce battle and further consolidating the bridgehead near Doneske, the capital of Biak Island. As a last resort, they recently landed on the small islands of Wai and Wendi south of the island, so the Biak Island campaign launched to end the New Guinea operation. As they said, they have encountered the most tenacious Japanese counterattacks in the past eleven months and have been pursued by a powerful Japanese army with a large number of tanks, retreating into a narrow coastal area. The operations on the mainland of New Guinea, which MacArthur boasted should have ended long ago, have been subjected to a full-scale counterattack by the Japanese army since the Tol River campaign, suffering huge losses. The Japanese army, which they called "unable to fight again," is still as strong as ever. The Japanese army, which was rumored to have exhausted its supplies and was waiting to starve to death, is even more calmly using tanks and modern weapons, forcing them to deal with it with a large amount of bloodshed. All these facts are enough to expose the fabrication of their propaganda and there is no need to argue about it here.</p>
<p>After the landing on Wakde Island and the landing at the mouth of the Tol River, followed by the landing on Biak Island, the enemy is eager to advance westward, but in reality, they have not gained a single victory. Only the enemy's exaggerated propaganda becomes more and more absurd and crazy with this ineffective westward advance. MacArthur's so-called landing operation on Biak Island seems to have been put on the right track and can proceed smoothly, but looking at the above war situation, their westward operation and the exaggerated propaganda they have made for it, in our view, are nothing more than a desire to achieve political effects among the residents of Biak Island and the Dutch East Indies. The purpose is not to achieve direct strategic effects.</p>
<p>Miserable Situation of Enemy Troops in Burma and India</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking of Burma and India, although the Japanese army inevitably has a difficult war there, the enemy is in a miserable situation. The Chongqing army's crossing of the Nu River was also exposed by us long ago. It was nothing more than a desire to divert the general public's attention from the disastrous defeat in the Central China operation and to show the British and Americans the existence of the Chongqing army in Yunnan Province. It is obviously a propaganda operation, and now it will end in this way. The enemy's intention is nothing more than to achieve results in terms of propaganda. However, in front of the mighty army, they lowered their heads and retreated back across the Nu River and returned to the east. There is nothing surprising about it. As for the battlefields in Manipur, northern Burma, even if the enemy makes exaggerated propaganda, the truth will soon be revealed to the world.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Japanese army has continuously achieved great victories in mainland China, forming a vast front. Now it is beginning to exert its true combat power. In particular, the enemy forces in the South Pacific are in contact with our strong inner defense line, causing the enemy to suffer greatly from the power of our army. This can be clearly understood by looking at the counterattack on Torokina Island on Bougainville Island and the effective counterattack in New Guinea. The supply line of our army in the south is definitely not as weak as the enemy has claimed.</p>
<p>As for the existence of some difficulties, it is certainly inevitable. However, these difficulties are minimal. Especially as the enemy approaches our strong inner defense line, their supply line is also lengthened. The advantage of our inner defense operations can be brought into full play, and it can echo the operations in mainland China and India-Burma, forming a major turning point in the war situation. This has become</p>
<h3>National General Mobilization</h3>
<p>The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association convened its third extraordinary general meeting on June 3rd, passing the National General Mobilization proposal. They hope that the entire nation, at this time of increasingly tense war situation, should seize the opportunity as soon as possible, immediately step forward to the front lines of the National General Mobilization, in order to achieve victory as soon as possible. President Abe said that in times of war, even one person's efforts or lack thereof is enough to affect the rise and fall of the country, so all citizens must be used in production, and then can we defeat the enemy in one fell swoop. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association is a civil organization, and the opinion of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is the opinion of the people, and the resolution of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association is a manifestation of the determination of the people. This resolution will naturally generate the greatest strength.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek the liberation of the entire Greater East Asia. The sooner victory is achieved, the sooner liberation will be completed. Therefore, all nationals in all countries within Greater East Asia cannot stand idly by, but must earnestly assist. The enthusiasm of assistance and the amount of assistance power are the main factors determining the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We can even say that</p>
<p>In the current situation, from the perspective of the people themselves, they should contribute all their strength to the country. The victory and defeat of the war determines the survival and elimination of the nation and the country, and the early attainment of victory can alleviate the suffering of the war as soon as possible, which is something that most people have already understood. However, victory can never be obtained by luck, especially a war of liberation cannot be successful without the joint struggle of the entire nation. In order to maintain their past vested interests, the enemy must fight us with all their might, and we must naturally strike them with all our might. Now is not the time to be stingy with energy, now is the time to fight desperately, the sooner and more we use our strength now, the longer and greater the peace we will enjoy in the future.</p>
<p>From the government's perspective, it should consider how to utilize the power of the people and concentrate it. If the people are determined to contribute their efforts, the government should give the people the opportunity to contribute their efforts, and even organize these forces into a great crystallized force. This is what is meant by unity between the leadership and the people. Uniting the power of the people is the sole task of the wartime government. If the power of the people cannot be united, the war will certainly not be able to win, and the government will not be able to unite the people.</p>
<p>The nationals of all countries within Greater East Asia must voluntarily and immediately rededicate their entire strength; the governments of all countries within Greater East Asia must sincerely and immediately concentrate all the strength of their people. This is the meaning of the National General Mobilization, and this is the only way to achieve victory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in the Vicinity of Kohima Launch Repeated Surprise Attacks; Crush Enemy's Attempted Breakthrough and Secure Entire Line</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 6th The enemy forces on the Indian front, in order to open up the Kohima-Imphal highway, alleviate the supply difficulties on the front line, and cut off the Japanese supply line, have been launching fierce attacks on the high ground north of Kohima since the end of May, with superior forces and about 4,000 troops. However, after repeated surprise attacks by the Japanese troops in the area, their main force was repelled. In this battle, the enemy abandoned 150 corpses, but a unit of 300 enemy troops still took advantage of the dense fog in the area to advance to the vicinity of the Japanese positions and the Japanese array area, attempting to break through the battle line. The Japanese army is currently continuing its fierce attack. On the other hand, a separate Japanese unit launched a night attack on the enemy forces approaching the Japanese position on the Aragala Heights southwest of Kohima, completely repelling them. Also, in the area of ​​Height 7522, 500 enemy troops were about to move, attempting to break through the Japanese position, but the enemy's attempt was thwarted due to the Japanese army's preemptive attack. After abandoning 100 corpses, they fled in disorder. However, the enemy troops are still trying to break through the Japanese position and cut off the Japanese rear supply line, and are currently launching repeated counterattacks, and are continuing to advance guerrilla warfare with aerial supply from the airborne commando. However, the Japanese troops responsible for the security of the supply line have completely crushed the enemy's attempt, and have secured the entire line, and have made complete preparations for the counterattack against the enemy.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on the Nu River Front</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 6th After the enemy troops crossed the Nu River, they attempted to seize the Nu River before the rainy season arrived. The elite units of the Japanese army launched a preemptive strike operation to annihilate and strike the enemy troops. The enemy troops are currently actively reorganizing their battle lines. On June 1st, the enemy troops in that area launched a counterattack with aerial supply and reinforcements. The Japanese army counterattacked on all fronts, engaging in combat with the main force of the enemy's Sixth Army everywhere, and fierce battles are being waged for days. Also, the 116th Division of the 53rd Army of the enemy troops once attacked Datangzi, and its 120th Division once attacked the Jiangjujie area. The Japanese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy troops in the rain. In the Beilengshuigou area, the 1st Division of the 54th Army of the enemy troops once attempted to retake Wadiang Street, but was surrounded by the Japanese army, and has now fled to the east of the Gaoligong Mountains. Also, an enemy company attempted to occupy a river crossing point south of Ren Nuo on the 2nd, but was crushed by the Japanese army. The following is a record of the comprehensive battle results of the Nu River operation from the beginning of May to the end of the month: the enemy troops abandoned more than 3,000 corpses, 82 people were captured, and the Japanese army captured 16 mortars, 75 light and heavy machine guns, 412 rifles, and many other clothing materials and ammunition.</p>
<h3>Fortification of Defenses in the Northern Kuril Islands Area; Japanese Submarines Active in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo The enemy, the United States, is eyeing the closest strategic point for a counter-offensive route against the Japanese mainland, so the fortification of the Northern Kuril Islands is valued not only by Japan but also by the enemy, the United States. A certain staff officer of the Japanese army in the area spoke on this matter as follows: The Northern Kuril Islands, the first line of defense for the protection of the imperial country, has now become a fortress. Rabaul on the southern front has been strongly defended thanks to the tireless efforts of the Japanese army, and we are determined to defend the northern first line. We believe that once the enemy, the United States, which is trying to destroy the divine land, invades this place, they will be annihilated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th The war results of Japanese submarines in the Pacific have been praised by the world. What cannot be achieved by surface warships and air force squadrons can be accomplished by submarines without failing their mission. As the Pacific war situation is now becoming more intense, the activity of Japanese submarines is unprecedented. Although the enemy has made exaggerated statements such as landing operations in the Philippines, air raids on the Japanese mainland, and cutting off the connection between Japan and the South, the enemy's ambitions will be shattered in an instant with just a slight activity of Japanese submarines. Under the activity of Japanese submarines, the enemy's supply route has become fragile. Recently, Nimitz stated that if the Japanese battle line is shortened, the threat that Japanese submarines pose to us will be even greater. From this, the fear felt by the enemy, the United States, towards the threat of Japanese submarines can be imagined. Currently, the enemy's defense islands in the Pacific and the US mainland are all within the range of Japanese submarines' activity. Using stealth to attack the enemy is the characteristic of submarines. During submerged navigation, enemy special aircraft carriers are especially the best targets for attack. The active tasks of submarines are to attack battleships, destroy supply routes, implement surprise operations, and reconnaissance patrol lines, and can pose a great threat to the enemy at any time and anywhere.</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th The Executive Yuan held its 212th meeting on the 6th to discuss matters. The President submitted for approval the Shanghai Special Municipality's request to change the price of each deed to 30 yuan because the selling price of the deed was insufficient to cover the printing costs. It was decided that the matter concerned changing the statutory price of the deed, and the Secretariat of the Yuan was instructed to draft a revised draft of the Deed Tax Regulations for a full resolution, which was passed and submitted to the Central Political Committee. For appointment and removal matters, the President proposed and the Military Commission approved the appointment of Xiang Zhizhuang concurrently as the lieutenant general commander of the 12th Army of the Army, which was passed. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government of Nanjing to Announce Temporary Measures for Food Rice</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Recently, the price of rice has soared unprecedentedly, greatly affecting the livelihood of citizens. The general public is even in danger of not having enough to eat in the morning and not knowing where the next meal is coming from. Therefore, the citizens are very concerned about and expectant of the measures to be taken by the municipal authorities after allowing free trading of rice. It is reported that the municipal government, after days of consultation with relevant agencies, has formulated temporary measures for the food rice of Nanjing citizens, which will be announced within days.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhang Returns</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th Zhang Yipeng, Minister of Judicial Administration, went to Shanghai on official business a few days ago. Now that the public affairs have been completed and the affairs of the ministry need to be taken care of urgently, he returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 6th.</p>
