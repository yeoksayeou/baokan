<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>又收到了一封讀者的信。</p>
<p>「吉田東祐先生：可惜你的言論產生得太遲了！在先前，巳經有我們的「名士學者」如胡適之流，主張日本應當拿「王道」來征服中國民族的心。首先實用「王道惑化」中國人民的，可首推爲先生了！「王道」是否能够征服中國民族的心，是一個可一考慮的問題。因爲我們中國「廣大的人民」巳早看到日木的「霸道」，你的言論雖甜，誰能信這是「正義」？你以爲中國民衆會盲目相信你的言論嗎？恐怕是幻想吧！你的言諭也許可博得一般門小市民」的「驚喜」，但對於中國的「知識階級」是毫無影響的，因爲你的言論的本身就是矛盾的，不合辯證的。「王道」是征服不了中國民族的心的，因爲中國民族的領導者是前進的知識份子，他們是反對婦王道」的，信「王道」的不過是被時代淘汰了的「儒家」「正統」的「國粹派」而已」！（原文刪去數行）</p>
<p>這封讀者來的信，犯了自稱前進知識份子人們的至要錯誤。假如像這位護者所說，日本的對華政策是霸道，那末對於這一霸道而建立王道者，就是現階段上仍盡進步作用的人。假如眞正像這位讀者所說，我是第一號的王道主義者，而與霸道橫行的萬惡社會拼命鬥爭着，那末由後面來襲擊我的這位讀者，自然就是霸道的「第五縱隊」囉！因此，這位讀者在主觀上或許是一前進的知識份子」，但在客觀上却是幫助大烟窟，「實業公司」，「外國式賭博公司」之類的老關，或第二種親日派，以及與此輩相勾結的第二種日本入，而起着反暨作甩囉！可惜「你的言論的本身就是矛盾的，不合辯證的」。</p>
<p>我的工作，只是想對東亞的革新批判力有所供獻。我代申報執筆，將近一年了，回顧這短短的一年當中，大家都會看得淸楚的，就是中國，尤共上海社會批判力的提高。一年前，最初我用筆鋒刺向「第二種親日派」之類的一切社會　劣時，我故意避開向第二種日木人攻擊的陣綫。這是因爲當時上海的批判力仍然還羽翼未全，而假如我不採取各個擊破的戰術，則我本身恐怕早已被抨擊得落花流水了。當時許多讀者未請我的苦衷，而只管站在民族主義的立塲上，寫信痛馬我：爲什麼專門攻擊第二種親日派，而不攻擊與他們相勾結一氣的「第二種日本人」呢？假如當時我忍不住他們的「激將法」，而向敗類的日本人開始總攻擊，則我們就不會有今天，而老早就無聲無央於興論界了。所以這批民族主義者，在客觀上也是替第二種親日派盡「激將」作用的。然而現在上海的社會批判力，業已達到不可侮的程度了。且中國方面也不能不承認，日本方面對過去對華政策的自我批判業已加強這一事實。例如迂大佐的演講之類，是過去從任何當局者都絕對聽不到的自我批判。筒言之，目前有很多志士在担憂現狀而痛切陳詞說，如不加以革新，則中國·日本·東亞。將同歸於盡，這是事實。</p>
<p>實際上，戰爭如不以道種社會批判力爲後援，獲得勝利是不可能的。這種社會批判力，並非是根據白紙黑字，戰在書本上的「道義」，而必須根據打擊虛偽的「道義」之具有生命力的道義。日本新進哲學家高山岩男氏，在「歷史的推進力與道義的生命力」一作中說過：「時代的轉變，如無權力的確實發動，或力量的廣汎發動，則前例是從未有過的。一般說來，歴史的推進力是力量，試觀無入古古今中外，時代都是經過許多鬥爭和戰役而轉變的，這不能不說是有力的證明。雖然馬上得天下者有之，但馬上治天下者却無前例。單純權力的門爭，縱令在某一時代內部興波作浪，然而改變時代，完成重大歴史使命者却沒有。在新的畫時代之頗的轉變門爭當中，往往存在着實現正義的道義精神，眞正的歴史性戰爭，一定含有道義的性格。」我們認爲，大東亞戰爭是解放亞細亞的歴史性戰爭，所以我們說，大東亞戰爭是以有道義性格的。在戰爭時期，發起外國式賭博公司，吸收游資（非爲國庫，而是爲私人的腰包），無論讓誰說，道都沒有絲毫道義氣味。靑少年憤然而起，反對毒害民族的鴉片和賭博，道是合乎道義的；但明知鴉片和賭算是毒害民族的束西，反而故意百般維持，這無論誰說也是非道義性的。（轉入第　版）</p>
<h3 id="c2">印緬邊境包圍戰將進入最後階段　英第七師主力已喪失過半 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　印緬戰綫日軍某基地電，緬印邊境日陸軍部隊，以布其頓孟多前面之納蓋德康爲中心，將英印軍第七師包圍，並連日繼續加以攻擊，着着壓縮包圍網，故敵軍己成堯中之諺。由於日軍連續砲轟及猛攻，被包圍中之敵軍茲已減少至三千人，裝配有戰車汽車等之敵機械化部隊，亦巳逐漸趨於潰減反之，日方之損害則極爲輕微，此使日軍十氣益形旺盛。此外由西亞派遣而來之敵八二一師，曾迂迴北方南下，由加拉頓河谷而抵達納蓋德庫北方二十里之地點，刻似着手建設機傷，由是印緬邊境之包圍戰，將於此而進入最後之階段。</p>
<p>仰光廿六日中央社電　印緬邊境日軍刻正以馬猶山脈爲中心，對英印第七師及英軍第五師推進殲減戰。茲誌廿四日傍晚以前之戰况如次：　敵第七師主力巳被日軍追至辛澤瓦盆地，其半數已被日軍擊減，所餘三千餘人現携坦克軍若干輛重砲十餘門徘徊該處，尋覓退路，日軍刻正加緊圍攻中。　馬猶河畔布其頓戰綫，雖因特固卓基特正面敵軍士氣巳喪，對日軍並未採取攻勢。　日軍連日對布其頓西北制來島埃德敵西方高地敵軍實行夜襲，該高地之陷落已篇時間問題。　孟多方面戰况並無變化，惟拉薩比爾北方日軍發動攻勢後，敵軍深感難於應付，其坦克車隊似已退部。</p>
<h3 id="c3">襲拉巴爾敵機被擊落多架 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>拉巴爾二十大日中央社電　敵DW24型機共計一百三十九架，於二十一日上午兩度來襲拉巴爾，日軍當即邀擊，擊落其六架，擊毀四架，日方受損極輕。二十二日上午又有敵機約一百八十七架，二度來襲，當被日軍擊落其四架，擊毀三架。二十三日的畫有敵B24P38型機共五十四架來襲，被日方擊落其一架。二十四日又有敵機一百八十六架數次來襲，當被日軍擊退。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　據中部太平洋某基地電，敵小型機十餘架，曾於二十三日晨來襲馬紹爾羣島之米勒島日軍所在部隊，被日軍擊落其一架。又二十四日畫復有敵B25型機十二架來襲馬羅危拉布環礁塔羅阿島，當地日軍部隊即與之交戰，敵機不支即逃逸，以上兩役日軍均無損失。</p>

<p>南京二十六日中央社電　本月二十八日，爲唐玄奘法藏法師一千二百八十一年前到寂之忌辰，中日文化協會以佛敎爲中日兩国共同所景仰，且於兩國文化溝通卜關係至巨，故本中日文化交流之旨，特於昨（二十五）日下午三時，邀請來京之日本京都知握院前法主林彥明大儈正，在該會舉仃三藏法師座談會，歡迎各界自由參加。</p>
<h3 id="c9">奸商囤積居奇渝物價高漲內地工業政策失敗 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>北平二十六日中央社電　渝方物價由貪官奸商之囤積居奇，致日爲昻騰。重慶昆明最近一月間之米肉法茶等，又高漲五成或五成以上。其中最甚者當屬專賣品，農產物，及日用品，次之食糧價格之昻騰，極爲顯著，此乃由一部奸商與官僚相互勾結囤積壟斷之故。淪方治下民衆，因惑生活日艱，故最近移向和平地區者旦衆，渝方爲防止此事，軍事委員會會頒佈食糧品禁止輸出抗戰區之侖令，並規定即給爲供軍需之小麥粉油　等，亦須請求地方長官之認可，犯此者則處以死刑或無期徒刑。然渝方之經濟情况，由於通貨之膨脹，及物資之缺乏，益爲窮迫渝方治下之民衆不堪其苦，乃屬當然者。據查重慶昆明民國三十二年十二月之主安物價指數，與民國二十六年比之重憂爲二百大十七倍，昆明爲二百六十倍云。」</p>
<p>廣州二十六日中央社電　渝方最近頻傳內地工業政策成功。自力抗戰態勢確立，以欺蒙治下民衆厭戰空氣。然渝方大公報近發表「財政經濟政策之檢討」一文，痛詆渝方丙地工業政策之失敗、其大意謂；渝方現下之工業政策，非僅未能使工業發展，反使工業益形不振。商業銀行間之對立，與高利貨之橫行，影響工業政策不能奏效，自力抗戰於是呈現破綻。加之屢於增加稅政之美名下，榨取工業之利潤，尤爲吾人所不能默視者。最近工業資本已有轉爲商業資本之傾向，因此工業界破產者層出，而一般游資仍不顧此危機，作最不健全之土地投機，與黃金輞賣。工業乃目力抗戰之中心，若無希望發展，抗戰前途，實無光明云。</p>
<p>陳參謀長視察運河南段防務</p>
<p>南京廿六日中央社電　我國海軍當局，鑒於運河南段（揚洲至淮陰）防務之重要，曾命南京要港司令部陳參謀長，率領砲艇江寗號江淸號江七號江廿號四艘，於廿一日起航赴該處巡視。同時治理運河籌鎮處殷處長汝耕及隧員等，亦乘艇前往視察，結果甚爲圓滿。當地民衆對我國新海軍之軍容，非常欣佩。茲悉和察業已　畢，陳參謀長與殷處長等，巳於廿大日午後返京</p>

<p>杭州廿六日中央社電　蕭山縣城廂一帶，發現流行性腦膜炎，勢甚猖獗。茲該縣當局爲防止蔓延，現已採取緊急措置，封鎖水陸交通，並檢查淸潔，注射防疫針，及施行消毒工作。</p>
<h3 id="c11">阿根廷政局發展美表示憂慮　法列爾代現阿總統職權 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　蘇聯社華盛頓電：阿根廷京城方面之消息極少，法列爾將軍已就任總統似爲事實，然因國粹派掌握特權，新政府之中心人物，或仍爲勞動部長裴龍上校。美國務　二十五日會見記者時，曾謂阿國國內情勢頗堪憂慮，或將影響西半球之安全，故美洲各國政府，須召開外交會議，以決定其共同之方策。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　阿根廷京城訊：副總統法雷爾雖未取得阿根廷總統之銜，然前總統賴米列茲之職鐵巳全由法氏接收。據法氏昨夜表示，渠之地位不過暫時性質，以待賴米雷茲之康復。惟前傳賴米雷茲業已辭職，據新任總統府秘書都勃稱，此不過爲代理行使職權而已，惟渠同時亦暗示內閣或將有變動。自法列爾就職後，阿根廷與軸心絕交後之數次新變動，可謂已達最高舉。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日巾央社電　據接近德外交部之國際情報處星期五日發表：阿根廷與軸心斷絕關係之行動，未能獲致阿國之和平。英美聯合對阿國施行壓力，現仍繼續不輟。</p>

<p>東京二十六是中央社電　德駐日大使史塔瑪，赴南方各地旅行，兼考察各地情形，前後歷時一月餘，於昨日返此，大使特於今日接見記者團，當即叩以此次旅行之印象，承大使簽覆如次：余此次爲明瞭南方各地情形，於一月二十八日由東京出發赴馬來爪哇西里伯及菲律資考察，余所獲印象最深者有三，　日眾佔領地之防衛已從速強化，頗爲鞏固，各地日軍將士充滿擊碎敵方反攻之意志。　各地經濟及工業之復典，均有長足之進展，余目覩南方資源及糧食品之輿富，頗爲敬佩，關於此等原料之利用，日木已獲莫大成功，當地之工業，已設有今雞納霜工塲·製糖廠·船所·及煉錫工塲等，各工廠均努力增產，對於完成戰爭實獻至大。　日軍與各地居民惑情極爲融洽，且各地居民均理解日木之大東亞理心，自願爲完成此戰爭而努力。余會訪問泰菲兩國，所獲印象殊佳，其工業及糧食問題，亦木建設大東亞共榮圈之目標予以解决。總之，日本今日已根擄三國盟約之精神，實現其所主張之大東亞共榮圈理念，余對此殊表滿意。</p>
<h3 id="c13">美增稅案成爲法律 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>

<p>增產意志堅决的日本女子挺身隊，陸續加入工塲工作，中島飛機〇〇工塲在一月八日也開到了第一批挺身隊，小姐們和學生們精神飽滿地操起工作機。</p>
<p>下面是關於女子挺身隊加人生產戰綫的種種問題的一篇談話錄。參與談話者爲中島飛機〇〇工塲勞務課長服部武雄氏，溝部丑雄氏，伊藤景康氏及敎育課林尤女史。</p>
<p>速成技術訓練</p>
<p>問　女子挺身隊的工作內容如何？</p>
<p>答　挺身隊和一般女性戰工不同，並不希望其成爲熟練工人·所以僅以造成她們爲技能工的目標加以敎育指導多數挺身隊的隊員在家庭中有其本來使命，從事家庭外的工作期間旣短，職業指導自異。就工塲的成績看，女子一般的服務年限大體爲二年半至三年，似乎耐得起相當勞動。工作是先讓她們慣於工場的生活，然後命她們擔仟輕懸的工作，例如涂縫，部品（平削，盤押）計器設設計圓案，打釘，詁配機體等。機械的裝配和發動機現在是男子的工作，但在最近的將來，關於機械裝配女工將佔二〇％七〇％，關於發動機將佔四〇％，如果更馴熟，則打釘和機體裝配也十半由女子來做。至於事務方面，當然盡可能採用女子。現在從事於事務工作的男子其中二〇％巳改進工塲。女子挺身隊繼其職，成績績頗好。</p>
<p>問　實地指導用什麼方法？</p>
<p>答　先進靑年學校的實習工塲。用類似正式工廠的設備作基本工作的訓練。並有講話和精神訓練，練成一職塲精神」。受到技能指導和精神指導後，即過工塲生活。所謂工塲生活，不妨認之爲「窗習工塲」的延長。工塲中配置相　年齡的指導者，實地指導因爲工作是簡單的，所以易於記憶。一星期的「實習工塲終了後，第一期卒業。厚生省已將一食成一個工人的時期由過去的三個月改爲一個月。想起來好像很勉強，但祗要有熱誠，一個月也是可以成功的。經過一年之後，不論那一個挺身隊員都可成爲優良的技能工，這在增加生產是很要緊的。不過，如果有一工作一年才會好」的思想，那末不獨是糟塌技能，而且從飛機增產，的立場看·也是一種困難。這點希望現在入所的隊員也能理解。</p>
<p>女性做的工作</p>
<p>問　何種工作宜於靑年女性呢？</p>
<p>答　製造飛機的工程上，有簡單的，也有因難的：就全體而言，宜於女子工作非常多，而重比男子更適宜的作也不少。例如配錢，瓦斯熔接，橡膠熔接，涂縫等，女工的成績較佳。尤其是配綫（運綫），如果錯了一根配綫，便會造迫成嚴重的事故，所以要心細手巧的女性。涂縫也是一針一針縫的·一針縫得不對，有時也會引起飛機在空中分解的危險，所以要認認眞眞地縫。這種工作，現在配置在工塲中磨鍊了多年的指道者，將來預備全由女子指導，男子則改作其他工作。機件的塗色現在全部是男子，將來也要改由女工來擔任。</p>
<p>問　女子挺身隊對於飛機的研究心和興味如何？</p>
<p>答　配屬於工塲以來爲時尚淺，似尚沒有俱正的興味和研究心。前幾天曾邀集各挺身隊代表，舉行談話會。那時，會員發表感想說；「在家庭和學校時雖聽到「航空决戰」，却米切實思索’可是一旦親身參加製造飛機。才痛切地惑到　而遙遠的雨方天空的血戰，亦歷歷如在目前，我們總得多多趕這飛機才好。」的確，年輕的姑娘們入所以來，每日看到飛起來的飛機和許多機體，她們的戰爭現觀乎也改變了。一個裝配機體的挺身隊員說：看見造成的飛機，想到我們婦女也能造飛　，很覺榮幸，每思我們也能略書棉薄，常常熟淚滿膠。</p>
<p>問　通勤與工塲的風耙問題如何？</p>
<p>答　女子挺身隊分爲住宿家中的通勤者和寄宿寮舍的住宿者兩種。寄宿的隊員都是遠離家庭以家庭情形不宜通勤，她們的生活和女學校的寄宿生活相彷。寮舍中有舍監巖格監督，風紀是無須擔憂的。至於通勤隊員，工作時間總比普通職工遲三十分鐘，以免在電車上和公共汽車上混雜不分。如果時間相同，那末男女分車，由交通自治會指揮，或以學校別及地域別分別集合，集團乘車。因此絕無使家族擔憂的事，這點希望家庭和學校理解安心。（吉：譯自一月三十一日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>第二種親日派和第二種日本人，在光怪陸離的名義下進行特殊貿易，只替別人打「派司，接受非法外快，而造成物價高漲的因素，道決不能說是道義。假如我們不和這類惡劣勞力拼死活，則決談不到獲致歴史性戰爭的勝利。爲了爭取大東亞戰爭這樣歷史性戰爭的勝利，則需要決不容或緩地打擊內部這樣的惡劣勢力。大東亞戰爭只要成爲整個亞洲的革新戰爭，而表現出道義性格時，則所有亞洲的民族，方能雀躍參加，於是大東亞戰爭方能取得一眞正亞洲解放戰爭的歴史性格。</p>
<p>至於中國的參戰，假如沒有最近上海南京方具未艾的社會批判力，而單純從氏力觀點上看，也可以說完全像個屁。因一爲參戰時會放過一個巨響，一但參戰的內容正像空空洞洞的氣體，而參戰後社會臭不可聞的醜熊，又令人髮指，這還不是屁而何？然而在這一年當中，由於不滿這種中國現狀的中日兩國人士尤其是靑少年所醞酗起來的社會批判力，正在中國的參戰本身上點綴上世界史的意。這就是設，中國參戰不僅是革新中國，而且是革新全東亞，而具有完成大東亞戰爭的道義性格之性質。最近新中國的社會批判力，不能不認爲是這樣的。這種社會批判力如不增大，則談不到三禁運動，也談不到抑平物價法和企業公司取締令之頒佈，且假如沒有這種批判力的激勵慫恿，而禁烟三年計晝也決捉不到議事日程上去。這一連申的法令，全是新中國方興未艾的社會批力所壓榨出來的。對於這點，在觀念上知道政治，而在實踐上不知道政治的「亭子間」政治家，或許會說：：無論怎樣頒佈道法令，最後結局，會在中國受到經濟力的壓迫，而像取締國積令一樣，成爲無用之長物。假如中國沒有社會批力，這批優秀靑年政論家，只知道批這這種社會批判力，而不知道參加道種社會批判力，就會正如這批人所講，任何法令也將變爲無用之長物然而假如道批人一致奮起，參加道種社會批判力。努力矯正政治，肅淸劣，那末縱或有人根本想把法令作爲無用之長物，而實現無用之長物局面，也不可得</p>
<p>此次所發表的禁烟三年計畫，是根據上海所發展起來的社會批判力而决定的，這點是不能不水認具有電大的意義政府重視這種社會批判力，道可以說是最近極開明的政策。自然，政府其有十分决心，忠實執行這個三年計。新中國的社會批判力，尤其是上海的批判力，爲協助和鼓舞政府這種決心，必須不憚煩瑣地進獻忠言。因爲不接受此會批判的惡劣勢力，仍然還盤據着強大的地盤，不時蠢動，導引政府政策走向岐途。總之，這個禁烟三年計畫，就是中國參戰能否具有眞正「道義性格」的試金石然而我敢斷言，中國的優秀靑年，突破道一試騐，進而對大東亞戰爭點綴上道義性格，這就是中國對世界史的最大供獻。（魯譯）</p>

<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Another reader's letter received.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke: It's a pity your opinions came too late! Previously, we already had our "famous scholars" like Hu Shih, advocating that Japan should use "benevolent rule" to conquer the hearts of the Chinese people. The first person to practically use "benevolent rule" to enchant the Chinese people may be you! Whether "benevolent rule" can conquer the hearts of the Chinese people is a question worth considering. Because we, the "vast people" of China, have long seen Japan's "hegemony," and though your words are sweet, who can believe they are "justice"? Do you think the Chinese masses will blindly believe your words? I'm afraid it's a fantasy! Your opinions may win the "surprise" of ordinary "petty citizens," but they have no impact on the Chinese "intellectual class," because the very nature of your opinions is contradictory and undialectical. "Benevolent rule" cannot conquer the hearts of the Chinese people, because the leaders of the Chinese nation are progressive intellectuals, and they oppose "benevolent rule." Those who believe in "benevolent rule" are merely the "Confucians," "orthodox," and "national essence faction" who have been eliminated by the times!" (Several lines of the original text have been deleted)</p>
<p>This letter from a reader makes a crucial mistake common to those who claim to be progressive intellectuals. If, as this reader says, Japan's policy towards China is hegemony, then those who establish benevolent rule against this hegemony are the ones who are still playing a progressive role at this stage. If it is truly as this reader says, that I am the number one advocate of benevolent rule, fighting desperately against a society rife with hegemonic evils, then this reader who attacks me from behind is naturally the "fifth column" of hegemony! Therefore, this reader may be a "progressive intellectual" in his own mind, but objectively he is helping the old bosses of opium dens, "industrial companies," and "foreign-style gambling companies," as well as the second type of pro-Japanese elements, and the second type of Japanese who collude with them, playing a counterproductive role! It's a pity that "the very nature of your opinions is contradictory and undialectical."</p>
<p>My work is only to contribute to the innovative critical power of East Asia. I have been writing for Shen Bao for nearly a year, and looking back on this short year, everyone can see clearly the improvement of the critical power of Chinese society, especially Shanghai society. A year ago, when I first used my pen to attack all kinds of social evils like the "second type of pro-Japanese elements," I deliberately avoided attacking the second type of Japanese. This was because the critical power in Shanghai at that time was still incomplete, and if I did not adopt the tactic of defeating them one by one, I myself would have been attacked and defeated long ago. At that time, many readers did not understand my difficulties, and only stood on the position of nationalism, writing letters to scold me: why do you only attack the second type of pro-Japanese elements, and not attack the "second type of Japanese" who collude with them? If I had not been able to resist their "incitement" at that time, and had launched an all-out attack on the degenerate Japanese, we would not have had today, and would have disappeared from the public opinion circles long ago. Therefore, this group of nationalists also played a role in "inciting" the second type of pro-Japanese elements, objectively. However, now the social critical power of Shanghai has reached an inviolable level. Moreover, the Chinese side cannot but admit the fact that the self-criticism of Japan's past policies towards China has been strengthened. For example, speeches like that of Uzu Colonel are self-criticisms that have never been heard from any officials in the past. In short, many patriots are currently worried about the current situation and earnestly state that if reforms are not made, then China, Japan, and East Asia will perish together, this is a fact.</p>
<p>In fact, war cannot be won without the support of this kind of social critical power. This kind of social critical power is not based on "morality" written in black and white, based on books, but must be based on the life-force morality of attacking hypocrisy. The new Japanese philosopher, Iwao Takayama, said in his work "The Driving Force of History and the Life-force of Morality": "The change of the times, if there is no definite initiation of power, or wide initiation of strength, then there has never been a precedent. Generally speaking, the driving force of history is power, and if you look at the past and present, at home and abroad, the times have all changed through many struggles and battles, this cannot but be said to be a powerful proof. Although there are those who win the world on horseback, there is no precedent for those who govern the world on horseback. Pure power struggles, even if they stir up waves within a certain era, cannot change the era and accomplish major historical missions. In the struggle for change in the new epoch, there often exists a moral spirit to realize justice, and a truly historical war must contain a moral character." We believe that the Greater East Asia War is a historical war to liberate Asia, so we say that the Greater East Asia War is of a moral character. During wartime, launching foreign-style gambling companies, absorbing floating capital (not for the national treasury, but for personal pockets), no matter who says it, has no hint of morality. Young people rise up in anger and oppose opium and gambling, which poison the nation, which is in line with morality; but knowing that opium and gambling are things that poison the nation, they deliberately maintain them in every possible way, which is immoral no matter who says it.

<h3 id="e2">The Encirclement Battle on the India-Burma Border is Entering the Final Stage; The Main Force of the British Seventh Division Has Lost More Than Half <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese Army on the India-Burma front states that Japanese Army units on the Burma-India border have encircled the British-Indian Army's Seventh Division, centered on Nagadekan, in front of Bukiton Mendo, and are continuing to attack it day after day, gradually compressing the encirclement, so the enemy army has become a bird in a cage. Due to the continuous bombardment and fierce attacks by the Japanese army, the enemy army in the encirclement has now been reduced to 3,000 men, and the enemy's mechanized units, equipped with tanks and automobiles, have also gradually tended to collapse. On the contrary, the damage on the Japanese side is extremely slight, which makes the morale of the Japanese army even more vigorous. In addition, the enemy's 821st Division, dispatched from West Asia, detoured north and south, and arrived at a location twenty miles north of Nagadekan from the Kaladan River Valley, and it seems to be starting to build bases there. Therefore, the encirclement battle on the India-Burma border will enter the final stage here.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army on the India-Burma border is currently carrying out annihilation battles against the British-Indian Seventh Division and the British Fifth Division, centered on the Mayu Mountains. The battle situation up to the evening of the 24th is recorded as follows: The main force of the enemy's Seventh Division has been pursued by the Japanese army to the Xinzeva Basin, and half of it has been defeated by the Japanese army. The remaining 3,000 men, now carrying a number of tanks and more than ten heavy artillery pieces, are wandering around the area, looking for a way out. The Japanese army is intensifying the siege. On the Bukiton front on the banks of the Mayu River, although the morale of the enemy forces on the front of Tekuk Tokkit has been lost, they have not launched an offensive against the Japanese army. The Japanese army has carried out night attacks on the enemy's western highlands on the northwestern side of Bukiton, which are controlled by the enemy, for days. The fall of these highlands is only a matter of time. There is no change in the battle situation in the Mendo area, but after the Japanese army north of Lhasa Bill launched an offensive, the enemy army felt it difficult to cope, and its tank fleet seems to have retreated.</p>

On the morning of the 22nd, about 187 enemy aircraft attacked twice, and four were shot down and three were destroyed by the Japanese army. On the 23rd, 54 enemy B24P38 type aircraft attacked, and one was shot down by the Japanese side. On the 24th, 186 enemy aircraft attacked several times, and were repelled by the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in the central Pacific, a dozen enemy small aircraft attacked the Japanese troops on Miller Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 23rd, and one was shot down by the Japanese army. On the 24th, twelve enemy B25 type aircraft attacked Tarawa Island in the Maroelap Atoll, and the local Japanese troops fought with them. The enemy aircraft could not withstand the attack and fled. In both of these battles, the Japanese army suffered no losses.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Profiteering Merchants Hoard and Speculate, Chongqing Prices Soar, Mainland Industrial Policy Fails <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Beiping, 26th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing's prices are rising daily due to hoarding and speculation by corrupt officials and profiteering merchants. The prices of rice, meat, tea, etc. in Chongqing and Kunming have recently risen by 50% or more in one month. The most serious of these are monopoly products, agricultural products, and daily necessities. The rise in food prices is also extremely significant. This is due to the collusion between a few profiteering merchants and officials to hoard and monopolize. The people under the rule of the surrendered side are living increasingly difficult lives, so recently there have been many who have moved to peaceful areas. In order to prevent this, the Military Commission has issued a surrender order prohibiting the export of food products to the war zones, and stipulates that even the wheat flour and oil, etc., which are immediately provided for military needs, must be approved by the local chief. Those who violate this will be punished with death or life imprisonment. However, due to the inflation of currency and the lack of materials, the economic situation in Chongqing is becoming more and more difficult, and it is natural for the people under the rule of Chongqing to be unable to bear the suffering. According to the investigation, the price index of the main items in Chongqing and Kunming in December of the 32nd year of the Republic of China was two hundred and seventeen times higher than that in the 26th year of the Republic of China, and Kunming was two hundred and sixty times higher."</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 26th (Central News Agency) - Chongqing has recently frequently reported the success of the mainland's industrial policy. Since the establishment of the self-reliance and resistance posture, it has been used to deceive the people under its rule who are tired of war. However, Chongqing's Ta Kung Pao recently published an article "Review of Financial and Economic Policies," denouncing the failure of Chongqing's industrial policy, the main points of which are: Chongqing's current industrial policy has not only failed to develop industry, but has made industry even more depressed. The opposition between commercial banks and the rampant high interest rates have affected the ineffectiveness of the industrial policy, and self-reliance and resistance have shown flaws. In addition, the extraction of industrial profits under the pretext of increasing tax policies is especially something that we cannot ignore. Recently, industrial capital has shown a tendency to shift to commercial capital, so bankruptcies in the industrial sector have emerged one after another, and general floating capital is still ignoring this crisis and engaging in the most unhealthy land speculation and gold sales. Industry is the center of self-reliance and resistance. If there is no hope for development, there is no bright future for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Chief of Staff Chen Inspects Defense on the Southern Section of the Grand Canal</p>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - In view of the importance of the defense of the southern section of the Grand Canal (Yangzhou to Huaiyin), our country's naval authorities ordered Chief of Staff Chen of the Nanjing Naval Command to lead four gunboats, Jiangning, Jiangqing, Jiangqi, and Jiang'er, to set sail on the 21st to inspect the area. At the same time, Director Yin Rugeng of the Grand Canal Management Office and tunnel personnel also went to inspect by boat, and the result was very satisfactory. The local people were very impressed with the military appearance of our country's new navy. It is learned that the inspection has been completed, and Chief of Staff Chen and Director Yin, etc., returned to Nanjing in the afternoon of the 20th.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - Soviet News Agency, Washington: There is very little news from the capital of Argentina. It seems to be a fact that General Farrell has taken office as president, but because the national essence faction has seized special privileges, the central figure in the new government may still be Labor Minister Colonel Pelon. The U.S. State Department met with reporters on the 25th and said that the domestic situation in Argentina is quite worrying and may affect the security of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the governments of the Americas must convene a diplomatic conference to decide on a common policy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - News from the capital of Argentina: Although Vice President Farrell has not obtained the title of President of Argentina, former President Ramirez's official duties have been fully received by Farrell. According to Farrell last night, his position is only temporary, pending Ramirez's recovery. However, it was previously rumored that Ramirez had resigned. According to the new Secretary of the Presidential Office, Dubb, this is only a temporary exercise of power, but he also hinted at changes in the cabinet. Since Farrell took office, the numerous new changes in Argentina after its break with the Axis powers can be said to have reached their highest point.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to the International Intelligence Office, which is close to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published on Friday: Argentina's actions to sever relations with the Axis powers have failed to achieve peace in Argentina. The joint pressure from Britain and the United States on Argentina continues unabated.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, traveled to various places in the South to inspect the local situation. After more than a month, he returned here yesterday. The Ambassador received a delegation of reporters today, and was immediately asked about his impressions of this trip. The Ambassador signed his reply as follows: I went to Malaysia, Java, Celebes, and the Philippines from Tokyo on January 28 to understand the situation in various places in the South. The three things that impressed me the most were: 1. The defense of the occupied areas has been strengthened quickly and is quite solid. The Japanese soldiers in various places are full of the will to crush the enemy's counterattack. 2. There has been considerable progress in the restoration of the economy and industry in various places. I was very impressed by the richness of the resources and food in the South. Japan has achieved great success in the utilization of these raw materials. Local industries have set up quinine factories, sugar factories, shipyards, and tin smelting factories, etc. Each factory is working hard to increase production, making great contributions to the completion of the war. 3. The feelings between the Japanese army and the local residents are extremely harmonious, and the local residents understand Japan's Greater East Asia ideal and are willing to work hard to complete this war. I visited Thailand and the Philippines, and the impressions I received were very good. Their industrial and food problems are also being solved in line with the goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In short, Japan today has realized the ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere that it advocates, based on the spirit of the Tripartite Pact, and I am very satisfied with this.</p>
<h3 id="e13">US Tax Increase Bill Becomes Law <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington: The US Senate yesterday, following the House of Representatives, rejected President Roosevelt's rejection of the new tax bill. The new tax bill has now become law. The original intention of this bill was to increase new tax revenues of 1.05 billion yuan, but Congress has significantly reduced it, by about one-fifth of the original amount. According to a British reporter stationed in New York, Congress maintained its legislative independence and overturned the President's rejection in a way that clearly left a way out for the President to take the next step. If President Roosevelt cannot compromise with Congress in the future, the current opposition force in Congress is sufficient to overturn all the legislative procedures he proposed in his annual address, including the extension of the Economic Stabilization Act (which expired last month), the Military Voting Act, and the Food Subsidy Act.</p>

The mission borne by transportation administration in wartime is of utmost importance. Transportation, aviation, communication, and other civil construction affairs are of the utmost importance, whether in establishing national defense or strengthening wartime administrative efficiency. In order to cope with the current urgent situation and strengthen the importance of transportation and economy, the government has reformed the transportation administrative organization and expanded the local related agencies. Within the possible range, the supervisory organization and the current organization are divided to seek the rationalization of the operation of the entire organization. At the same time, the organization is thoroughly simplified to ensure that each employee is accurate in his duties. In addition, the attitude of promoting wartime administration is adopted in the original form within the permission of the situation, so as to be able to engage in wartime mobilization. At the same time, the content of the affairs under its jurisdiction will be reviewed to simplify it, and the reform organization of the "mobilization organization" will be further established, so as to ensure the perfection of the operation of the affairs under the decisive battle.

Appropriate countermeasures have been considered, and it has been decided to expand and prepare the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and it will be implemented from March 1st in order to thoroughly realize the various policies.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Japanese Women's Volunteer Corps Cooperate to Increase Production <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Women's Volunteer Corps, determined to increase production, are joining factory work one after another. On January 8, the Nakajima Aircraft Factory also welcomed the first batch of volunteer corps. The young women and students enthusiastically took up their work machines.</p>
<p>Below is a transcript of a conversation on various issues regarding the Women's Volunteer Corps joining the production line. Participants in the conversation were Takeo Hattori, Chief of the Labor Section of the Nakajima Aircraft Factory, Ushio Mizobe, Yasuyuki Ito, and Ms. Yu Hayashi of the Education Section.</p>
<p>Accelerated Technical Training</p>
<p>Q: What is the content of the Women's Volunteer Corps' work?</p>
<p>A: The Volunteer Corps are different from ordinary female workers, and we do not expect them to become skilled workers. Therefore, we only aim to train them to become skilled workers and provide them with education and guidance. Most of the members of the Volunteer Corps have their original mission in their families, and their time working outside the home is short, so the vocational guidance is naturally different. Judging from the factory's performance, the average length of service for women is generally two and a half to three years, which seems to be able to withstand considerable labor. The work is to first let them get used to factory life, and then assign them to light suspension work, such as painting seams, parts (flat planing, disc pressing), instrument design, nailing, and airframe allocation. Mechanical assembly and engines are currently men's work, but in the near future, female workers will account for 20% to 70% of mechanical assembly, and 40% of engines. If they become more skilled, then nailing and airframe assembly will also be done mostly by women. As for administrative work, of course, we will use women as much as possible. Currently, 20% of the men engaged in administrative work have been reassigned to the factory. The Women's Volunteer Corps have taken over their jobs and have performed well.</p>
<p>Q: What methods are used for on-the-job guidance?</p>
<p>A: The Youth School's practical training workshop is advanced. Basic work training is done using equipment similar to that of a formal factory. There are also lectures and spiritual training to cultivate a "workplace spirit." After receiving skills guidance and spiritual guidance, they live in the factory. Factory life can be regarded as an extension of the "window study workshop." The factory is equipped with instructors of similar age to provide on-the-job guidance because the work is simple, so it is easy to remember. After one week of "practical training workshop," the first term ends. The Ministry of Health and Welfare has changed the period for training a worker from three months to one month in the past. It sounds like a stretch, but with enthusiasm, one month can also be successful. After one year, any member of the Volunteer Corps can become an excellent skilled worker, which is very important in increasing production. However, if there is an idea that "a job will only be good after one year," then not only is the skill ruined, but also from the standpoint of increasing aircraft production, it is a difficulty. This is something we hope the members who are now joining will understand.</p>
<p>The Work Done by Women</p>
<p>Q: What kind of work is suitable for young women?</p>
<p>A: In the manufacturing of aircraft, there are simple and difficult tasks. In general, there is a lot of work suitable for women, and there is also a lot of work that is more suitable for women than men. For example, wiring, gas welding, rubber welding, painting, etc., female workers perform better. Especially wiring (carrying wiring), if one wire is wrong, it can cause serious accidents, so it requires careful and skillful women. Painting is also sewing stitch by stitch. If one stitch is wrong, it can sometimes cause the aircraft to disintegrate in the air, so it must be sewn carefully and seriously. For this kind of work, we are currently assigning instructors who have been tempered in the factory for many years, and in the future, we plan to have all of them guided by women, while men will switch to other work. The coloring of machine parts is currently all done by men, but in the future, it will also be done by female workers.</p>
<p>Q: What is the Women's Volunteer Corps' research interest in aircraft?</p>
<p>A: It seems that they have not yet had a real interest and research mind since they were assigned to the factory. A few days ago, we invited representatives from each Volunteer Corps to hold a discussion. At that time, the members expressed their feelings, saying: "Although we heard about the 'air war' at home and at school, we did not think about it deeply. But once we personally participated in the manufacturing of aircraft, we painfully realized that the bloody battles in the distant sky are vividly in front of us, and we must hurry up and build these aircraft as much as possible." Indeed, since the young girls joined, they have seen flying aircraft and many airframes every day, and their view of the war has also changed. A member of the airframe assembly corps said: Seeing the aircraft we made, and thinking that we women can also make aircraft, I feel very honored, and whenever I think that we can also contribute a little bit, tears often fill my eyes.</p>
<p>Q: How are commuting and factory discipline issues handled?</p>
<p>A: The Women's Volunteer Corps is divided into commuters who live at home and boarders who live in dormitories. The boarding members are far away from home and their family circumstances are not suitable for commuting. Their lives are similar to the boarding life of a girls' school. There are strict dormitory supervisors in the dormitories, so there is no need to worry about discipline. As for the commuting members, the working hours are always thirty minutes later than ordinary workers to avoid mixing with them on trains and buses. If the time is the same, then men and women are separated into different cars, directed by the Transportation Self-Government Association, or gathered separately by school and region, and ride in groups. Therefore, there is absolutely nothing to worry the family about. We hope that families and schools will understand and feel at ease on this point. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 31)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters Promotes Use of Air Defense Clothing; Air Defense Clothing Symposium Held Yesterday <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: In order to cultivate Shanghai citizens' air defense awareness and make it easier to cope with air defense measures in the event of an air raid, the Shanghai Special City Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters held a symposium on Chinese citizens' air defense clothing at the Douchang Hotel at 3 PM yesterday. Present were Deputy Director Noguchi Kinjiro of the General Affairs Department of the Headquarters, Section Chief Okawa Rinpei of the Police Defense Department, Chief Ide Kiyomi of the Fire Department, Deputy Director Nagai Isamu of the Health Department, Head of the Propaganda Section of the General Affairs Department Hayashida Shigemi, Ikeda Kazuo, Chen Gongzhan, Head of the Liaison Section Hirayama, Xie Riben of Wing On Company, Cai Bosen of Sun Sun Company, Xia Huilin of Sincere Company, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Kou presided over the meeting and reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that during the various air defense drills held on Air Defense Day on February 9, the results were excellent, but the Chinese people had not paid attention to air defense clothing and had not made any preparations. This poses a great danger to covering the whole body and preventing injuries. Air defense clothing can prevent burns and minor injuries, and facilitate air defense measures, so we want to arouse public attention and prepare air defense clothing. However, the principles for clothing should be lightweight, economical, and suitable for all seasons. Today, we would like to invite everyone to express their opinions so that we can arouse the city's Chinese citizens to use air defense clothing during the third air defense day on March 9, etc. The attendees exchanged opinions, and the conclusion was: the material should be cheap and economical, and old clothes should be used as much as possible to transform air defense clothing. Add long sleeves, gloves, long trousers, or leather legs, thick machines, and use women's rain hats, and fold them in half to make air defense hats. However, take mobility into account, add buttons, and usually put the air defense clothing in an air defense bag and carry it with you, so that it can be taken out and used immediately in the event of an air raid. Also, men's long robes and women's cheongsams can be equipped with belts, and when the air raid occurs, the long robes can be folded and tied high to take various air defense measures. The above-mentioned measures will be used by the department to use newspapers, or post slogans, and use radio propaganda to arouse public attention in manufacturing. The best use of old materials for the required materials, and when necessary, the department will discuss proper distribution methods with the allocation authorities. Several air defense clothing patterns drawn by Ms. Qiu of the Social Welfare Department were distributed during the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Weekly Review (Continued from First Page) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The second type of pro-Japanese faction and the second type of Japanese, under bizarre names, engage in special trade, only acting as intermediaries for others, accepting illegal extra money, and creating factors that lead to high prices. This cannot be said to be moral. If we do not fight these bad labor forces to the death, then we will never be able to achieve victory in the historic war. In order to win such a historic war as the Greater East Asia War, we need to resolutely and without delay strike against such bad forces within. Only when the Greater East Asia War becomes a war of reform for the entire Asia and demonstrates a moral character, can all Asian nations participate joyfully, and then the Greater East Asia War can obtain the historical character of a truly Asian liberation war.</p>
<p>As for China's participation in the war, if there is no recent social criticism in Shanghai and Nanjing, and it is simply viewed from a force perspective, it can be said to be completely like a fart. Because when participating in the war, it will make a loud noise, but the content of participating in the war is just like empty gas, and the socially smelly and unbearable ugliness after participating in the war is infuriating. Is this not a fart? However, during this year, due to the social criticism brewed up by people from both China and Japan, especially young people, who are dissatisfied with the current situation in China, the meaning of world history is being adorned on China's participation in the war itself. This is to say that China's participation in the war is not only to reform China, but also to reform the entire East Asia, and has the nature of completing the moral character of the Greater East Asia War. The recent social criticism in New China cannot but be regarded as such. If this kind of social criticism does not increase, then there will be no talk of the Three Bans Movement, nor will there be any promulgation of the Price Control Law and the Company Elimination Order, and if there is no encouragement and instigation of this kind of criticism, the three-year plan to ban opium will never be put on the agenda. This series of decrees is all squeezed out by the emerging social criticism in New China. For this point, those "pavilion" politicians who know politics in concept but not in practice may say: No matter how these decrees are promulgated, in the end, under the economic pressure in China, they will become useless like the hoarding control order. If China does not have social criticism, and these excellent young political commentators only know how to criticize this kind of social criticism, but do not know how to participate in this kind of social criticism, then, just as these people say, any decree will become useless. However, if these people all rise up and participate in this kind of social criticism, and strive to correct politics and eliminate the bad, then even if some people fundamentally want to make the decrees useless and realize the situation of uselessness, it will not be possible.</p>
<p>The three-year plan to ban opium that was announced this time was decided based on the social criticism that developed in Shanghai. This point cannot but be acknowledged as having tremendous significance. The government attaches importance to this kind of social criticism, which can be said to be the most enlightened policy recently. Naturally, the government has full determination to faithfully implement this three-year plan. The social criticism in New China, especially the criticism in Shanghai, in order to assist and encourage the government's determination, must offer loyal advice without fear of being tedious. Because the bad forces that do not accept this social criticism still occupy strong ground and are constantly moving to guide the government's policies astray. In short, this three-year plan to ban opium is the touchstone of whether China's participation in the war can have a truly "moral character." However, I dare to assert that China's excellent youth will break through this test, and then adorn the Greater East Asia War with moral character. This is China's greatest contribution to world history. (Lu Translation)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Simple Treatment for Meningitis <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In the early stage of meningitis, there is headache, shortness of breath in the chest, and stiff neck. Then there is opisthotonos and coma. This is a dangerous symptom. Those who suffer from this symptom have swelling of the head due to heat, and the root has been damaged. Recently, a Chinese medicine doctor invented the most economical, most effective, fastest, and safest treatment method. A child of 14 years old occasionally felt unwell, with only headache and chest tightness at first. The next day, he had a stiff neck, his eyes rolled upwards, and he was unable to recognize colors. His mind was confused, and he was bedridden. After asking Chinese and Western doctors for diagnosis and treatment, none of them worked. Later, he was sent to a certain hospital in Xuzhou, where he was diagnosed with meningitis. He was immediately prescribed medicine injections, totaling dozens of injections. Just when the hospital's stock of medicine was running out and everyone was panicking, a friend came and taught him a method. Use calcined ferrous sulfate until it has efficacy, grind it into a fine powder, and sieve it. If the patient has a headache on the left side, blow some ferrous sulfate powder into the right nostril. If the headache is on the right side, blow it into the left nostril. If the head hurts on both sides, blow it into both nostrils. After two or three minutes, the chest will feel clear and refreshed, which is the effect. Next, the head and eyes will be clear. Afterwards, continue to try blowing it. In one or two days, the illness was completely cured. The son of friend Mr. Li suffered from this symptom, and after trying it, he also recovered suddenly. After recovery, there was no suffering from numbness in the five senses. Later, after studying this matter with [missing character] Qi Huang surgeons, it was said that ferrous sulfate has astringent properties and can astringe the ripeness of the brain [missing character] to make it divination. The blood clots that flow from the nostrils are ripe poison. This medicine is sour, cool, and non-toxic. It is a product for resolving phlegm and detoxification, and it strengthens the accumulation of blood. Northern doctors use this to rescue many people, and they also sent this medicine to a German doctor in Jinmen. After chemical experimentation, the reply letter was very appreciative, which is a highlight for the national medical community. Another prescription: almonds, peach kernels, glutinous rice, pepper (if not, replace with scallion white), and raw gardenia seeds, each coin. Crush them together, and use egg white to mix with more flour to make a paste. Apply the above two prescriptions and fight on the inside of the Nie family's Applied Good Prescription. Recently, meningitis has been prevalent in various places such as Suzhou, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, and Linpu, and many people have died. These two prescriptions are simple and easy to implement, and can be used at the same time. In closed areas in rural areas where there is no good treatment method, it may be worth trying.
