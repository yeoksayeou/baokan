<h3 id="c1">談物價 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月七日周代院長談物價問題，認爲現時物價上漲，絕非通貸膨脹，而最大原因是物瓷缺乏及一般人囤積。今後當努力於增加生產與節約消費，關於物價對策及整個具體計劃，刻正縝密研究中。　　九日，本市徐經濟局長召集各業公會代表，談物價問題，認爲八月間之物價高漲，雖一般商人藉口原料缺乏，交通受阻，但根據一般貨物突行抬價，確爲非法舉動。希望商人各就本位確定合理價格，隨時呈報，勿再乘機抬價損人利已。　　上面兩段話，可以視爲當局對於目前物價問題的處理意見，前者是關係一般的，後者是關係本市的。不過，僅僅是一種處理的意見，在物價問題的本質上，起不了什麼解決的作用·尤其是本市的物價問題，僅僅希望商人勿再乘機抬價損人利已，以過去追求暴利的種種實例以觀，恐怕成效極微的。　　物價高漲的程度，根據可靠的的統計，職員階級，假定二十五年平均一月所需爲六十餘元，則目前已漲至三百餘倍。二十五年時薪水階級每月收入六十餘元，極爲普遍，而目前每月收入二萬元者，實屬不易。所以薪水階級生活之困苦，可以想見。物價高漲的原因，討論的文章很多，歸納之不外○電力再限制，影響生產量。○運輸困難，物價交流不能圓滑。○黃金與華股上升劇烈。○華北資金南流，吸引物資北移。總之，脫不出通貸與物資的範疇。如果通貸並不膨脹，物資生產不減，而交流圓滑，物價自然不會突受刺激上漲。在這樣合理的經濟狀態之下，囤積抬價等暴利行爲，也很難猖獗逞凶。可惜幾年以來，討論自討論，對策自對策，而物價始終成爲無法解決的問題。　　扼要言之，物價問題，目前但求其穩定，並不奢望下跌。而事實上能夠做到穩定，也可算獲得了解決。如何穩定呢？在決定一切對策之先，唯一的前提條件，必須把握通盤處理的關鍵，然後切實的澈底的配合實施·我們檢討幾年以來，當局對於物價措施，不能謂爲不設法，不努力。而未能獲效的原因，就在枝枝節節，不切實，不澈底。譬如說，一面竭力主張增加生產，而一面卻有意無意地放任增產障礙物的存在，或不能積極設法解決妨礙增產的因素。遠的不說，最切實的如日用必需品，當然應該不斷的生產，使供應上不發生過度的恐慌。可是，目前的事實，一因動力限制，二因原料運輸困難，無法不斷的生產，於是，供應發生恐慌，求過於供，焉得不漲。結果增產徒成口號。當然，我們也知道限制動力因煤斤缺乏，原料困難因運輸工具不敷。出於不得已的措置，並非故意如此。可是，我們必須進一步明瞭，這是站在電力及運輸當局的立塲，固然困難。而在負有整個經濟權責的政府當局立塲，就不能也以困難了事，應在極困難的環境中開闢辦法。同時，與盟邦關係當局取得最大的協力尤爲重要。譬如以民船集團北煤南運，增加煤斤來源。譬如以人力畜力舉辦驛運，增加運輸能力。這裹不過舉例說明，物價問題必須通盤處理，配合實施。如果再枝節的頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳，則所研究的對策與辦法，仍不免於紙上談兵而已。　　最後，我們感於幾年以來高物價的痛苦經騐，不得不喟然而曰：[不論任何方面，凡是操有處理物價的權責者，他本身並未感到高物價壓迫的眞切痛苦，所以，並未以眞心誠意的毅力解決物價問題。]這是不無遺憾的。</p>

<p>東京十日中央社電　鶴見祐輔氏九日在衆院預集總會中談：日蘇關係之現狀，實爲日本國民及各國人士所急欲一知者。東亞乃東亞人之東亞，英美之染指東亞，就地理方面及其他任何方面言，均不合乎自然。但蘇聯之關心東亞，則就地理方面人種方面均極合乎自然，蘇聯總歸爲東方之國家，並無英美般對於人種之偏見，所以斯拉夫民族大和民族之間，能有相互瞭解之基礎。又重光外相談，日蘇兩國壤地相接，相互保持中立，此蓋以中立之條約爲基礎，且爲兩國大局上實現上之利害關係所支配者。日本之方針係與中立國及其他壤接鄰國善鄰友好，日蘇相互信賴，則日政府之政策可順利進行，吾人正於此種明確之信念下推進外交。</p>

<p>擊毀美機四十餘架　　東京十日中央社電　日本大本營十日下午二時卅分發表，日軍機隊八日邀擊來襲滿地區之敵B29型機。首於其來路鞍山上空，編於其歸路，同時日機並肩惡劣天氣，進攻其基地之成都附近飛行塲，排除敵戰門機之邀擊，而猛攻正行降陸之敵機。迄今判明所獲之綜合戰果如次：擊落六架，（一架不確，）擊毀六架，擊壞二十八架，總計四十架，日機損失六架，內一架之駕駛員乘降落金落下。　　東京十日中央社電　日杉山陸相會於十日下午，在衆議院預算總會席上報告，空製滿洲之敵美B29型機約四十架，其中約半數，在渝方基地爲日機隊擊落，或彼擊毀。其大意謂，中國方面晶機隊，八日夜進攻駐渝美B29型機基地成都機塲，於敵機空襲滿洲歸還後，立即施以猛炸，詳細戰果，刻在調查中。現已判明之戰果如次：確實中彈起火者五架，確被擊毀者十一架，日方未歸還者二架。此外，九日晨在老河口被迫降落之B29型機一架，亦遭日機猛炸起火。截至十日，綜合敵方損害，計擊落或擊毀者達四十餘架，故空襲滿洲之八十架美機中，有半數被毀，是役日機損失六架。</p>

<p>蘇維埃革命以來迄今日止，各級學校雖實行男女同學制，但自去年九月開始的新學期起，初級並中等學校加以廢止。這或許有種種理由，但要不外乎將初級學校的一年級男學生，與女學生隔離，強化軍隊式教育與訓練，以養成將來的紅軍將士。學生的學校生活上，也自去年起定下了非常嚴格的學生規則，要求有規則的生活。先前學生會見先生時，毌須日本式的禮義，但今後必須敬禮，在課室內懶惰的學生，有權加以懲罰，確立了先生對學生的權威。　　宗教的復興，也不以爲與此全然無綠。尊嚴的教會內的空氣，與無條件對神服從與犧牲的心，正與今日蘇聯的指導者所求於第一線將士與後方國民者有共同之點。莫斯科現在有八十多個教會，神學校也開設起來了，宣傳宗教的維誌和單行本也出版了，在教堂中舉行結婚儀式，受洗禮的孩子們亦陸續多起來，教會事業蒸蒸日上，做禮拜時，年輕的紅軍士兵頗多。總主教塞開向神祈禱（去年十一月七日的革命紀念日的祈禱）：[　護神所賜給我們的指導者（史太林）]，又各地教會當舉祈禱禮，祝出征兵士武運長久。由此可見蘇維埃國家經此次德蘇戰爭後，其官僚機構巳加上軍事組織的粉飾，其中央集權機構愈益強化，史太林元帥從克林姆宮的大本營號令國民　　娛樂事業照常熱鬧　　可是，雖然這樣說，後方的蘇聯市民，卻也未必一天到晚過着嚴肅的兵營生活。一天的工作完畢後，即消遙自在。演戲，歌劇，電影，跳舞，公園中散步，他們設法享業自由的時間。蘇聯政府也並不藉口時局緊張，危機臨頭，而採取將演戲，歌劇，電影，跳舞等娛樂機關停閉或縮小的措置。縱在德軍衝到莫斯科郊外六十公里之綫，德軍戰車即將突入莫斯科市內那樣緊張的時候，莫斯科歌劇塲每夜演出如常，電影院在空襲解除時·殆全部繼續上映。斯達林格勒傳稱將近陷落的一九四二年之夏，我居於庫襲希夫，訪地的市立公園，露天舞塲每每熱鬧異常，年青的男女們，結束了工廠與事務所的工作後，在歸家途中，躭擱二三小時，跳舞作業。工作完畢後的他們，似乎完全忘記了戰爭那回事，亨樂自由的時間。今日的莫斯科，各公園中均設有此種舞塲·僱了爵士樂隊，讓到公園裹來的男女們尋樂。（翔：譯自八月十九日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>市民防空本部發表談話　　上海特別市民防空本部對九次防空日舉行各種防空演習成績，發表談話如次：　　溯自大東亞戰爭開始以來，上海地區發出之空演製警報，總計不及三十次，而自本年六月以來，巳有二十餘次之多，可見本市區最近之情勢緊張，不許過分樂觀。同時上海市民對空襲時之防範，須有加賢實施之必要，但一般市民對此漠不關心，實爲大謬。當局有鑒於此，爲喚起全市民衆對防空之關心，俾使非常時期人民生命損害減至最低限度，故此次訓練重點·傾注於市民避難及實施綜合訓練。</p>
<h3 id="c26">參加演習逾數萬人 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>九日市內各區實施訓練者，計共八十一處，直接參加者，逾數萬人。參加各單位均熱烈認眞，實堪欣慰。但一般市民對防空智識尚感缺乏。譬如，避難之險之感，尚須他人強制或勸導，即在避難時，自己並無生命有受空襲危險之感，尚須他人強制或勸導後，始予實行。但事實上當敵機來臨或聞得敵機聲響時，市民應即自動迅速找尋適當之處，俯伏臥下。關於救護方面，巳受輕重傷以致生命發生危險者，即須施行救護，而救護人員之態度，更應認眞嚴肅，反之，若輕率隨便，殊深遺憾，以後希望人民在避難及救護兩方，更具眞誠，務使達到圓滿之境地。今後此種訓練，人民爲顧及其自身性命之安全，須互相扶助，以愛鄰友助之精神，達到理想之目的。</p>

<p>再此次防空日，日空軍演習，投下假想爆炸彈，其宗旨在指示人民在敵機投彈時應如何處置，在此時間內，人民處置之法亦多錯誤。譬如當燒夷彈投下時，人民忘卻有燃成大火之可能，爆炸彈下投時，則忘卻應如何處理被炸受傷之人，定時彈下投時，將在一定時間內爆炸，人民須遠避於一定距離之外，均須注意及之。　　上述各項關於炸彈下投時人民應具之智識，爲應付時局更高度之要求，一旦發生不幸時，應如何防備之法，此爲必須計及者，一般指導防空者，嗣後更須進一步努力，向確立防空鐵壁之大道邁進。又九日晚上之燈炎管制狀態，似較平日狀態爲劣，尤以郊區一帶之燈火管制爲甚，然退一步言，四五月來演習之成績，巳較襄昔進步良多務使燈光絕不洩漏，以爲敵機之目標。總之，防空當局希望人民對防空措置，時時改進，完成大上海萬全之防空，是爲至要。</p>

<h3 id="e1">On Commodity Prices <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, President Zhou of the Executive Yuan discussed the issue of commodity prices, stating that the current price increases are definitely not due to currency inflation, but primarily due to the shortage of goods and hoarding by the general public. He said that efforts will be made to increase production and conserve consumption in the future, and that a comprehensive study of commodity price countermeasures and a concrete plan is currently underway. On the 9th, Xu, the Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, convened representatives from various trade associations to discuss the commodity price issue. He stated that although merchants generally cited a shortage of raw materials and transportation disruptions as reasons for the soaring prices in August, the sudden increase in the prices of general goods was definitely an illegal act. He hoped that merchants would each determine reasonable prices within their respective positions, report them at any time, and refrain from taking the opportunity to raise prices to harm others for personal gain.</p>
<p>The above two paragraphs can be regarded as the authorities' opinions on how to deal with the current commodity price problem, the former relating to the general situation, and the latter relating to the city. However, they are merely opinions on how to deal with the issue and do not address the essence of the commodity price problem. In particular, regarding the commodity price problem in this city, simply hoping that merchants will refrain from taking the opportunity to raise prices to harm others for personal gain, given the various examples of the pursuit of exorbitant profits in the past, I am afraid that the effect will be minimal.</p>
<p>According to reliable statistics, the degree of commodity price increases is such that, for the salaried class, assuming that the average monthly expenditure in 1936 was over 60 yuan, it has now risen to more than 300 times that amount. In 1936, a monthly income of over 60 yuan for the salaried class was extremely common, while currently, a monthly income of 20,000 yuan is indeed not easy to come by. Therefore, the hardship of the salaried class's lives can be imagined. There are many articles discussing the reasons for the soaring commodity prices, which can be summarized as follows: ○ Restrictions on electricity again, affecting production volume. ○ Transportation difficulties, hindering the smooth flow of goods. ○ Sharp rise in gold and Chinese stocks. ○ The flow of funds from North China to the south, attracting materials to move north. In short, it cannot escape the scope of currency and goods. If currency is not inflating, goods production is not decreasing, and exchange is smooth, then commodity prices will naturally not be stimulated to rise suddenly. Under such a reasonable economic state, profiteering behaviors such as hoarding and raising prices would also be difficult to run rampant. Unfortunately, for several years, discussions have been just discussions, countermeasures have been just countermeasures, and commodity prices have consistently become an unsolvable problem.</p>
<p>In short, regarding the commodity price problem, we currently only seek stability and do not expect a decline. In fact, being able to achieve stability can be considered a solution. How to stabilize it? Before deciding on any countermeasures, the only prerequisite is to grasp the key to comprehensive handling, and then implement it effectively and thoroughly. Looking back on the past few years, we cannot say that the authorities have not made efforts or worked hard on commodity price measures. However, the reason for the failure to achieve results lies in the fragmented, impractical, and incomplete approach. For example, on the one hand, we are trying to advocate for increased production, while on the other hand, we are intentionally or unintentionally allowing the existence of obstacles to increased production, or failing to actively find ways to solve factors hindering increased production. Not to mention the distant past, the most practical example is daily necessities, which should of course be continuously produced so that there is no excessive panic in supply. However, the current reality is that, firstly, due to power restrictions, and secondly, due to difficulties in raw material transportation, continuous production is impossible. As a result, panic occurs in supply, demand exceeds supply, and how can prices not rise? In the end, increasing production becomes merely a slogan. Of course, we also know that restricting power is due to a shortage of coal, and that the difficulty in raw materials is due to insufficient transportation tools. These are unavoidable measures and not intentional. However, we must further understand that this is indeed difficult from the standpoint of the electricity and transportation authorities. But from the standpoint of the government authority responsible for the entire economy, it cannot simply be excused as difficult and should open up ways in extremely difficult circumstances. At the same time, it is especially important to obtain the greatest cooperation from the allied authorities. For example, use civilian shipping groups to transport coal from the north to the south, increasing the source of coal. For example, use manpower and animal power to organize postal transportation, increasing transportation capacity. These are just examples to illustrate that the commodity price problem must be handled comprehensively and implemented in coordination. If we continue to treat the symptoms without addressing the root cause, then the countermeasures and methods studied will still inevitably be empty talk.</p>
<p>Finally, feeling the pain of high commodity prices over the past few years, we cannot help but sigh and say: [Regardless of any aspect, whoever has the authority and responsibility to deal with commodity prices has not personally felt the real pain of high commodity price oppression. Therefore, they have not solved the commodity price problem with genuine and sincere determination.] This is regrettable.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Mr. Yūsuke Tsurumi spoke in the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 9th, saying: The current state of Japan-Soviet relations is something that the Japanese people and people from all countries urgently want to know. East Asia belongs to East Asians, and the involvement of the United Kingdom and the United States in East Asia is unnatural in terms of geography and any other aspect. However, the Soviet Union's concern for East Asia is extremely natural in terms of geography and ethnicity. The Soviet Union is ultimately an Eastern country and does not have the same prejudices against race as the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, there can be a basis for mutual understanding between the Slavic and Yamato peoples. Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu added that Japan and the Soviet Union are adjacent to each other and maintain neutrality. This is based on the treaty of neutrality and is also governed by the realization of mutual interests in the overall situation of both countries. Japan's policy is to be good neighbors and friends with neutral countries and other neighboring countries. With mutual trust between Japan and the Soviet Union, the Japanese government's policies can proceed smoothly. We are promoting diplomacy under this clear belief.</p>

His words were as follows: Korea and Japan share the same bloodline, and recently, they have made significant contributions to the promotion of the volunteer soldier system and various production increase efforts. However, the treatment of Korean and Taiwanese compatriots is quite different from that of Japanese in the mainland. They should be granted the right to participate in politics. Although it is too late to formally implement this matter, there are many issues that need to be studied, so it is currently under careful consideration.</p>

<p>Nu River Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – The 8th Army and the 3rd Detachment of the Yunnan Expeditionary Force of the Chongqing Government previously surrounded the Japanese army positions at La Meng. Currently, the Chongqing army has launched an encircling attack, which is very fierce. On the 2nd of this month, a large unit of the Chongqing army suffered heavy losses after being severely wounded by a small number of Japanese soldiers who were fighting to the death, and was forced to retreat. On the morning of the 4th, the Chongqing army increased its reserves and launched another attack. After repeated counterattacks, it was finally repelled by the Japanese army. Thus, the Chongqing army's attempt to recapture La Meng was reduced to a pie in the sky.</p>

<p>Destroying Over Forty American Aircraft</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:30 PM on the 10th that Japanese aircraft squadrons intercepted enemy B-29 aircraft attacking the Manchurian region on the 8th. First, they formed up over Anshan in the incoming route, and simultaneously attacked the airfield near Chengdu, their base, on the return route, despite adverse weather conditions. They eliminated enemy fighter escorts and fiercely attacked enemy aircraft that were landing. The comprehensive results obtained so far are as follows: shot down six aircraft (one unconfirmed), destroyed six aircraft, and damaged twenty-eight aircraft, for a total of forty aircraft. The Japanese aircraft lost six aircraft, and the pilot of one aircraft landed safely.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of the Army Sugiyama reported at the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the afternoon of the 10th that about forty enemy American B-29 aircraft had bombed Manchuria, and that about half of them were shot down or destroyed by Japanese aircraft at their base in Chongqing. His gist was that the Japanese air squadron attacked the Chengdu airfield, the base of the American B-29 aircraft stationed in Chongqing, on the night of the 8th, and immediately launched a fierce bombing after the enemy aircraft returned from bombing Manchuria. Detailed battle results are currently under investigation. The battle results that have now been determined are as follows: five aircraft certainly hit and on fire, eleven aircraft certainly destroyed. Two Japanese aircraft did not return. In addition, one B-29 aircraft forced to land in Laohekou on the morning of the 9th was also fiercely bombed by Japanese aircraft and caught fire. As of the 10th, the total damage to the enemy was that over forty aircraft were shot down or destroyed. Therefore, half of the eighty American aircraft that bombed Manchuria were destroyed. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft lost six aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Chongqing American Air Bases Shake <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Continental Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – After the fall of Hengyang and Lingling, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing lost two more land bases. In particular, Lingling had greater strategic value than the others. The enemy army has a total of four bases on the line connecting Hengyang and Liuzhou on the ground, namely Hengyang, Lingling, which is 120 kilometers away from Hengyang, Guilin, which is 300 kilometers away, and Liuzhou, which is 370 kilometers away. There are hundreds of enemy aircraft on this line, facing off against the Japanese army. If Hengyang is the front-line air base, then Guilin is the basic base, and Lingling is the satellite base between the two. Therefore, the fall of Lingling has caused Guilin, which has lost its satellite base, to be greatly embarrassed.</p>
<p>Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) – The American 20th Air Force, mainly composed of B-29 aircraft, bombed Anshan and Benxihu in southern Manchuria on the 8th. On the morning and afternoon of the same day, they attacked the areas of Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Handan in Henan, and Dexian in Shandong with several aircraft. In this regard, the Japanese North China Army announced the following at 9:00 PM on the 8th: ○ On the 8th, more than eighty American bombers passed through North China to bomb Manchuria, of which forty-six had definitely returned. ○ Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Dexian, Handan, and other places were attacked by enemy B-29s, killing and injuring more than ten Japanese and Chinese people each, and damaging several civilian houses.

<p>Hunan Front, 10th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army is currently launching a major offensive operation with the aim of reaching the border of Guangxi Province, and had completely occupied Lingling on the 7th. Also, a certain unit of the Japanese army, in response to this, occupied Xinning (an important point 70 kilometers west of Lingling in Guangxi Province) on the morning of the 8th, after capturing Dong'an (an important point 35 kilometers west of Lingling on the border of Guangxi Province). Another unit of the Japanese army is approaching the provincial border, pointing towards Quanxian (an important point in Guangxi Province) along the Xiang-Gui Railway. The Japanese army's rapid offensive operation is still continuing.</p>

<p>Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) – From the 11th of this month, the Allied nation of Japan will form a national land defense force with reserve soldiers.

<h3 id="e12">Strict School Education <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Since the Soviet revolution until today, all levels of schools have implemented a co-educational system for both boys and girls, but starting from the new semester in September of last year, this system was abolished for elementary and secondary schools. There may be various reasons for this, but it is primarily to separate male students in the first grade of elementary school from female students, strengthen military-style education and training, in order to cultivate future Red Army soldiers. In students' school lives, very strict student rules have also been established since last year, requiring a disciplined life. Previously, students did not need to perform Japanese-style etiquette when meeting a teacher, but from now on they must salute. Students who are lazy in the classroom can be punished, establishing the teacher's authority over the students.</p>
<p>The religious revival is also not considered completely unrelated to this. The dignified atmosphere inside the church and the heart of unconditional obedience and sacrifice to God have common ground with what the Soviet leaders of today seek from the frontline soldiers and the people in the rear. There are now more than eighty churches in Moscow, seminaries have also been established, propaganda for religious journals and booklets has also been published, wedding ceremonies are held in churches, and the number of children being baptized is also increasing. Church affairs are thriving, and there are quite a few young Red Army soldiers worshipping in churches. Archbishop Sergei prayed to God (at the prayer for the anniversary of the revolution on November 7th last year): [Protect the leader (Stalin) given to us by God], and churches everywhere should hold prayers to wish the soldiers going on expeditions long military luck. From this, it can be seen that after this German-Soviet war, the Soviet state's bureaucracy has added the embellishments of a military organization, its centralized institutions have been strengthened, and Marshal Stalin commands the people from the headquarters of the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Entertainment is as lively as usual</p>
<p>However, even so, the Soviet citizens in the rear do not necessarily lead a serious military camp life all day long. After finishing a day's work, they are carefree. They try to enjoy their free time by going to plays, operas, movies, dances, and taking walks in the park. The Soviet government also does not take measures to close or reduce entertainment facilities such as plays, operas, movies, and dances, citing the tense situation and the impending crisis. Even when the German army reached the line 60 kilometers outside Moscow, and at a time when German tanks were about to break into Moscow, the Moscow Opera House performed every night as usual, and the cinemas continued to show films almost entirely when air raid alarms were lifted. In the summer of 1942, when Stalingrad was rumored to be about to fall, I was in Kuibyshev, and the open-air dance floor in the local municipal park was often extremely lively. Young men and women, after finishing work at factories and offices, delayed two or three hours on their way home and danced. After finishing work, they seemed to completely forget about the war and enjoyed their free time. Today in Moscow, all parks have such dance floors, hiring jazz bands to let the men and women who come to the park have fun. (Sho: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, August 19th)</p>

<p>Two Thousand Aircraft Bomb Supply Lines</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the French front: The anti-Axis forces are slowly advancing towards the German border on a front of approximately 200 miles between Liège and Metz. Three locations are now 35 miles from the German border and are about to engage in a formal decisive battle with the German army defending the Siegfried Line. The anti-Axis forces have established five bridgeheads over the Moselle River and are advancing further east, but the German artillery fire becomes more intense as they approach the German border. Furthermore, the British Second Army has crossed the Albert Canal north of Rouen and is currently attacking Périgueux in the north. The American Third Army has advanced from the area of ​​Thionville on the east bank of the Moselle River to the east of Liège and is currently attacking in the direction of Aachen. These three armies can be seen as beginning the attack on the Siegfried Line. The American Seventh Army has also reached Besançon, 50 miles from the German border. It is still difficult to know where the anti-Axis forces will focus their offensive when it begins, as the German western border line extends approximately 500 miles from the north of the Netherlands to the border of Switzerland. Currently, the Canadian First Army and a part of the American army are striving to seize the area along the Strait of Dover, and Ostend on the Belgian west coast has fallen into the hands of the British army. The enemy army is repeatedly and fiercely bombing the German army's supply routes and bases behind the Siegfried Line with two thousand heavy bombers, and the atmosphere of the decisive battle on the Western Front has become intense in recent days.</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) – DNB News: The German army's retreat along the coast of Flanders towards the Scheldt estuary to the northeast is still gradually underway. The anti-Axis forces are doing everything in their power to prevent the German army surrounded between the Lys River, the Scheldt River, and the coast from joining up with the German army in southwestern Netherlands. The German army is fighting bravely in rear-guard actions to resist the pressure from the anti-Axis forces advancing from the southwest via Nieuwpoort and Tholen. General Montgomery has not only designated the Canadian First Army to be responsible for encircling Flanders, but has also dispatched a part of the British Second Army to attack Antwerp and Hulst in order to break through the southeastern Netherlands and the northeastern corner of Belgium. However, the majority of the British army is currently still on the northeast bank of the Albert Canal, engaged in expanding their bridgeheads.</p>

The right wing of the American First Army has been fighting for a week in the battle to cross the Meuse River between Dinant and Sedan. The German army is retreating towards the East Ardennes after a delaying action and has occupied new positions in the Reusel and Maas areas. The American Third Army is advancing towards the Moselle River between the Luxembourg border and Metz, but has only made slight gains. The American army's pincer movement to attack the Moselle has not yet achieved a decisive victory.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Completing Shanghai's Air Defense to Meet Current Situation Requirements <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Statement by the Municipal Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Air Defense Headquarters issued the following statement on the results of various air defense exercises held on the Ninth Air Defense Day: Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the total number of air raid warning sirens sounded in the Shanghai area has been less than thirty. However, since June of this year, there have been more than twenty, indicating that the recent situation in the municipality is tense and does not allow for excessive optimism. At the same time, it is necessary for Shanghai citizens to strengthen their air raid precautions, but the general public's indifference to this is a serious mistake. In view of this, the authorities, in order to awaken the public's concern for air defense and minimize casualties in times of emergency, focused this training on citizen evacuation and comprehensive training.</p>
<h3 id="e26">More Than Tens of Thousands Participate in Exercises <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>On the 9th, a total of 81 locations in various districts of the city conducted training, with more than tens of thousands of direct participants. The participating units were enthusiastic and serious, which is gratifying. However, the general public still lacks air defense knowledge. For example, the sense of danger in seeking refuge still requires the coercion or persuasion of others. Even when seeking refuge, they do not feel that their lives are in danger of air raids and must be forced or persuaded by others before taking action. In fact, when enemy planes approach or when the sound of enemy planes is heard, citizens should immediately and automatically seek suitable places to lie down prostrate. Regarding rescue, those who have suffered minor or serious injuries to the point where their lives are in danger must be rescued, and the attitude of the rescue personnel should be serious and solemn. Otherwise, if they are careless, it is deeply regrettable. In the future, it is hoped that the people will be more sincere in both evacuation and rescue, so as to achieve satisfactory results. In the future, in order to ensure their own safety, the people must help each other, and with the spirit of loving neighbors and friends, achieve the ideal goal.</p>

<p>During this Air Defense Day, the Japanese Air Force conducted exercises by dropping hypothetical bombs, the purpose of which was to instruct the people on how to act when enemy planes drop bombs. During this time, people also made many mistakes in their actions. For example, when incendiary bombs were dropped, people forgot the possibility of large fires. When explosive bombs were dropped, they forgot how to deal with those injured by the bombing. When time bombs were dropped, which would explode within a certain period of time, people had to stay away from a certain distance. All of these must be paid attention to. The above-mentioned knowledge about what the people should know when bombs are dropped is necessary to meet the higher demands of the current situation and how to prepare for unexpected events. This must be considered. General air defense instructors must make further efforts to move towards the great road of establishing an iron wall of air defense. In addition, the state of light control on the evening of the 9th seemed to be worse than usual, especially in the suburbs. However, in retrospect, the results of the exercises in April and May have improved greatly compared to the past. We must ensure that no light is leaked, so as not to be a target for enemy planes. In short, the air defense authorities hope that the people will constantly improve their air defense measures and complete the comprehensive air defense of Greater Shanghai, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Fuel Prices Illegally Increased Authorities Closely Monitoring <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price of fuel has risen sharply. Hard firewood has risen from 560-570 yuan per dan to 1,500-1,600 yuan, and the price of rice straw has risen from 560-570 yuan per dan. There is no standard for the price increase of coal. The price of coal slag has risen even more sharply, with a general price of 1,200 yuan per basket. Coal balls are hovering around 1,000 yuan per dan. Since fuel is one of the necessities of people's livelihood and is indispensable for a day, the frequent rise in market prices is indeed a great harm to people's livelihood.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Hoarding and Profiteering <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, the sources of firewood and rice straw have been arriving in a steady stream recently, averaging over 1,000 dan per day, and the inventory is also quite sufficient. However, some merchants are using the pretext of the slow arrival of coal as an excuse to hoard and speculate, resulting in a shortage of spot supply in the market, and the market price is illegally raised. Due to the imbalance between supply and demand, citizens are forced to purchase at high prices.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Authorities Investigating and Punishing Hoarders <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The authorities in charge of price management have already paid close attention to the trend of fuel prices and are currently dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate hoarding. Anyone found to be a non-business merchant hoarding a large amount of fuel, or a business merchant stockpiling a large amount of fuel and refusing to supply it to the market, or constantly raising prices, will be subject to legal sanctions. The public is also requested to assist by reporting any such cases at any time, so that personnel can be dispatched for secret investigation, but they are asked to provide detailed information on the location of the hoarding.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, under orders, is uniformly handling advertising businesses throughout the city.

It is understood that the advertisement plaques have been manufactured by the municipal government and handed over to the Public Utilities Bureau, which will soon begin to replace them. Advertisers who previously held old advertisement plaques from District 1 or District 8 can submit the old plaques and receive new plaques to be placed on the advertisement frames for uniformity.</p>

<p>The China National Opera School was founded by Xu Muyun and Li Songling, and has been in operation for three years with remarkable achievements. Since leaving Shanghai in October last year, they have performed in Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, and other cities, and have gained a great reputation. After returning to Shanghai with great acclaim at the beginning of last month, they hired several more famous teachers and reorganized the board of directors, with Minister Chu Minyi serving as chairman. Xu Muyun is the principal, and the other directors, such as Lin Kanghou, Bao Guochang, Wang Yuqi, and Liu Nansheng, are all well-known figures in Shanghai. It has now been decided that the school's male and female students will perform at the Huangjin Grand Theater every Thursday, Friday, and Saturday for a long period of time. Most of the more than one hundred students at the school are outstanding, especially in martial arts. The "Little Angels," who have been away from Shanghai for a year, can be seen again on the stage. Yesterday, Minister Chu took time out of his busy schedule to inspect the new school building (the former site of the Xieqiao Huining Hospital) and gave an earnest speech, showing great care.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Key Points of Baojia Fee Payment Procedures <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Payment Due Before the 7th of Each Month</p>
<p>Since unifying the Baojia system throughout the city, the Shanghai Police Bureau's Baojia Office has also decided to uniformly collect Baojia fees starting in July. At that time, due to the preparations being underway, it was temporarily stipulated that July and August would be collected together. Now that it is September, payers should pay their fees. The reporter has learned about the procedures for payers to pay the Baojia fees: Citizens pay their fees using a fee payment certificate issued by the Baojia Office, which is free of charge. When paying, the Lianbao Office will affix a value certificate to it. The certificate also specifies the head of the household's name and distinguishes between special households, shop households, regular households, and attached households. It also details the address, including the district, bao, jia, and household number. Here are five points to note for payers: ○ Citizens should pay their Baojia fees for the month within one week, from the 1st to the 7th of each month. ○ After paying the specified amount, the Jia leader will issue a [Fee Payment Certificate] with the same amount printed on the ticket. ○ This fee payment certificate must have the overlapping seal of the original collecting Jia leader affixed on the back as a receipt. ○ This receipt should be kept properly for receiving allocated goods and handling household registration procedures. ○ Those who do not pay before the 7th of each month must wait until the following month to pay, and during the period of default, in addition to not being able to enjoy the benefits of Article 4, they will also be charged a late fee of 50%. (However, those who default on the fifth clause and are charged an additional 50% will not be given a [Fee Payment Certificate] for the same amount).</p>
