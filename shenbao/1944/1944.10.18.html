<h3 id="c1">消滅英美的野心 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>本月七日德富蘇峯翁在東京寶贊壯年團演講，說英美所運用的手段只有三樣，第一是征服，第二是獨佔，第三是利益的榨取。他們除了逞弄武力，別無所長，他們簡直不可理喻，所以除了打，打，打，再沒有教訓他們更好的方法。使他們轉換觀念的不是交涉，也不是妥協，而是只有打。這幾句話充分說明了英美過去在東亞侵略的歷史，代表全體大東亞民族發出反抗的怒吼，表示我們對於敵人有深望的認識，對於戰事有最後的決心。　　中國自從鴉片戰爭以後，沒有一個時刻不在被侵略之中。鴉片戰爭就是用武力保護英人，用鴉片來毒害中國民族的身體，用鴉片來榨取中國民族的金錢。此後陸續利用通商的名義，投資的假面具，使他們達到政治侵略，經濟侵略的目的。特別是民國二十四年李滋羅斯的法幣政策，使中國的金錢全數搬往倫敦，再轉紐約，從此中國的命運就逃不出英美的圈套。民國二十六年英美更挑撥中國和日本衝突，使東亞民族自相殘殺，鶴蚌相爭而英美坐收漁翁之利。　　英美的野心要把整個亞洲，變做非洲，變做印度。土地只是他們的殖民地，民族只是他們的奴隸，他們的目的，要利用政治上經濟上文化上的侵略方法使我們永久不得翻身，除了投順被壓迫外，沒有第二條路可走。近百年來的東亞歷史便是英美侵略野心的證據，特別是中國民族處在英美野心下，渡着最艱苦危險的生活。　　盟邦日本於民國三十年冬發動的大東亞戰事，是東亞民族最高的覺悟，使東亞民族認清了敵人，使大家知道自相殘殺的徒然有利於敵人，使大家知道互相團結，向唯一的敵人進攻是整個民族的生路。這三年來，予打擊者以打擊，使英美敵人受到最大最深的教訓，但是要改變他們的觀念，消滅他們征服，獨佔，榨取利益的野心，還需要繼續努力。爲了想保持過去百年來侵略所得的權益，敵人必定還要用全力來壓迫我們，我們也得用全力來抵抗。正如德富翁所說：[只有打，直打得他們五體投地，除此之外，更沒有澈頭澈尾良善完成戰爭的途徑]。　　消滅英美敵人的野心就是要使敵人的心理改變，要使敵人淌有侵略的野心，先要使敵人知道侵略我們的不可能。造成這個心理上的轉變，除了用戰爭的力量以外，沒有別的方法。大東亞戰爭快將三年了，敵人的損失浩大，正是自作自受，足夠英美野心家的覺悟。我們感覺最慚愧的，中國參戰已將二年，對於戰事的協力眞是微乎其微，我們不能夠在前方與盟邦將士駢肩殺敵，我們難道還不能夠在後方多努力一點嗎？我們每讀到盟邦人士決心殺敵的言辭，我們終覺自愧於心，希望每個國人深自勉勵。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日大本營續發表擊毀敵艦隊戰果台灣東海空戰入第二階段 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日下午四時發表：日軍機隊十六日於台灣東方海面，邀擊敵軍新來援之機動部隊，擊毀其航空母艦·戰艦各一艘以上。　　東京十七日中央社電　日軍自十二日以來，於台灣東方海面包圍敵機動部隊，予以殲滅打擊，據日本大本營十七日發表，敵軍爲援救該方面作戰，更出動別動機動部隊，此事已甚明瞭，此種新出動之敵機動部隊，以特設空母爲主幹，伴以制式空母若干艘，戰艦，巡洋艦各若干艘。日空軍是日接得敵機動部隊來襲之消息後，當即出動，十六日於台灣東方海面將敵包圍後，當展開激烈之白晝攻擊，下午一時四十五分，日軍攻擊隊與敵巨型式艦上戰鬥機三十餘架交戰，於擊落其數架之後，即衝入敵部隊上空，對敵空母一艘，戰艦一艘等反覆施以痛炸，未幾，敵空母一艘中彈起火，戰艦一艘被炸毀，巳無法航行，是役確已判明敵空母戰艦各一般被炸毀，日機隊收獲赫赫戰果後，歸還原防。　　中央社訊　日本神勇艦隊，日前在台灣東方海面獲得空前勝利，頃據軍事消息靈通人士所悉，在台灣之東方海空戰，業已進入第二階段，而日本聯合艦隊目下正在搜索追擊，定可將太平洋所殘留之敵艦全部殲滅，況殘留之敵艦均已身受重創，不便航行，而日聯合艦隊之一部份水上艦隊，現正集中追擊，尤其在南洋之日基地，如飛機及艦隊，靜待敵艦隊倉皇遁走過境時，加以殲滅，故此項殘留敵艦，決難越雷池一步，無法脫逃。如今日艦隊之對塞班島·大宮島·迭尼安島并不重視，惟對追擊竄遁殘敵，則嚴密予以注意，即如敵美目前情形，今主力精銳艦隊之消滅，海軍之死亡，飛機之毀損，殊難設法補救，尤其對槍械彈藥武器之補給，亦困難異常，故今敵美有此兩端情形，益日趨艱難嚴重。再觀日軍在此次之赫赫大戰果中，實爲日本本身之生產，已達到充分完善之境，是爲獲得偉大戰果之因素，同時，此次戰果，尤爲日本國民所努力奮鬥之良好結果。查敵美太平洋艦隊主力精銳，瀕於全滅，然吾人決不因此自傲，應作更進一步之奮發，加倍努力至撲滅敵美而後已，惟在太平洋敵主力雖已殲滅，但在中國大陸方面之渝美空軍，難免有蠢動企圖，至在印度洋之敵英艦隊，在今後之作如何行動，日本素對其注視，此次之大戰果，在一給予盟邦德國之振奮，二給蘇聯有良好之印象，三對菲全國民給予更大之自信。</p>

<p>周代院長對盟軍致賀　　南京十七日中央社電　行政院周代院長爲台灣東海面戰後盟軍獲勝，特發表談話如下：盟軍目前在台灣東海面戰勝美海軍，沉毀其航空母艦及主力艦多艘，美艦隊披糜潰退，捷報傳來，我國朝野上下，同深慶賀。溯自美海軍奪取塞班·大宮兩島後志得意滿，以爲日海軍已無戰鬥力，故率意輕進，迭擾不笠原·帛琉及菲律賓各島，且進犯台灣，豈知日主力艦隊之所以隱蔽不出，正所以義成美海軍之驕氣，靜待良機，一舉而殲之。良以日本海軍之最高原則，非在日本近海海面決不輕出，此次台灣之役，佔有天時地利人和，故能一戰而捷，所謂天時，即指時機成熟，所謂地利，即地近本土，以逸待勞，所謂人和，則在塞班大宮兩島失陷之後，全體將士咸抱同發敵愾之心，誓雪沼吳之恥，哀兵必勝，古訓昭然，是役雖尚未可視爲決戰，而與日俄戰爭時對馬一役後先媲美，日本[無敵海軍]之名，益見確立，且獲此大勝後，必勝之信念益堅，大東亞戰爭勝利益有把握。惟是美海軍經此挫敗，雖一時不致再犯，不久或將捲土重來，此在盟軍當然已有準備，我國以盟邦之地位，除對此次勝利表示萬分慶賀，對盟軍將士致其敬意外，尤當以同生共死之精神，協力完遂大東亞戰爭，以確保東亞之解放也。</p>
<h3 id="c4">美五十八機動部隊編成內容 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　台灣東方海面潰走之美國第五十八機動部隊，乃爲太平洋反攻和戰而編成者，以強力之新式空母羣爲主幹，並有主力艦，補助艦及大補給船團，司令官爲米茲卡。此大機動部隊爲掩護對日軍進攻，在太平洋行動時，配屬於第五艦隊，稱日第五十八機動部隊，在西南太平洋行動時，屬於第三艦隊，稱日第三十八機動部隊，此次出擊，因與第三艦隊連合作戰，故美國稱日第三十八機動部隊。關於此部隊之編成，六月廿三日美國海軍部謂，美國海軍發表目下在塞班行動中之第五十八機動部隊，去年掩護吉爾貝特各島及本年二月馬紹爾之登陸作戰，更在麥克活塞麾下協力荷蘭地區登陸，並兩次進攻特魯克，帛喇雄浦，小笠原大島及琉黃島。該艦隊之火器，相當於美軍基準砲兵隊七十隊，裝有可與巨大沿岸砲臺等各種火砲約八百五十門，第五十八艦隊又稱艦隊列車，可自本國赴遠海作戰，有所謂[貸與航團]之稱。此機動部隊，不論赴何處均可補給燃料，食料代替機賀駛員等，全艦隊之滑行路，合計爲一百二十五萬平方英尺，可出動一千架艦載機。</p>

<p>中國某基地十七日中央社電，渝美空軍十五日傍晚以B24型機及P51型戰鬥機約五十架，組成以聯合編隊來襲廣州，日戰鬥機隊當即予邀擊，在廣州市上空展開激烈空戰，另一方面，日機更追擊謀向西方遁走之敵，卒在三水附近以重創，截至現在止，經判明之戰果，計擊落敵B24型機二架，P51型機五架，擊毀B24型機一架，P51型機一架，綜計九架，是役日機亦有四架未歸返。　　香港十七日中央社電　香港部督部報道部·十六日下午五時發表：十六晶下午三時三十分，會有駐渝美空軍戰鬥機轟炸機聯合編隊約數十架，侵入香港上空，然經日軍邀擊後，即行潰走，此役擊落敵機兩架。</p>
<h3 id="c6">馬尼剌高雄前日空襲 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　米茲卡部隊，於台灣海面被擊潰後，美有力新機動部隊爲予以救援，並收容殘餘船艇，十六日於台灣東海面出現，即遭日空軍第一次攻擊，結果，被炸毀空平戰艦各一艘。按該機動部隊，十六日晨會以艦載機約百五十架，空襲馬尼剌附近，又同日午後，臺灣之高雄附近，亦有自中國大陸飛來之B29型機二十五架轟炸約三十分鐘，始行退去。該機動部隊，原來之任務，本係米茲卡之後衛，擔任第二次攻擊部隊之任務，旋因戰況邀變，方始不得已擔任收容米茲卡部隊之任務，其空襲馬尼剌及高雄·乃係爲掩護其收容工作所採取之行動，刻空戰戰果尚水判明。</p>
<h3 id="c7">日岡崎部長發表談話 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日外務省岡崎弘報部長·十六日特不今次美海軍之慘敗所予羅斯福政權之影響，發表談話如次：日軍前屢言將美軍引至陸上基地近處時，將加以反入，今觀諸台灣戰事，實可言其言非虛也。過信自已戰力之美海軍，對大總統選舉政略之刺戰，罔視戰略，來襲日本本土近處，結果夢想未成，反遭慘敗，美軍於襲擊日本南西羣島，當初會大事宣傳其空襲沖繩，台灣，並廣播美軍航空部隊損害輕微，以及艦船毫無損害云。然隨戰局之激變，則宣傳似已啞然，如今次對日大本營之發表，並不反駁一言，其對自國不利時之瞞蔽主義，自珊瑚海，所羅門海戰以來，已如羅斯福政府之長技，今次亦因而臨大總統選舉戰，故其進慮苦惱，更爲深刻。禁止發表日方戰果，或作最小限度之發表，以欺瞞國民耳目，然美政府無論如何遮瞞國民耳目，若注視今後對日作戰之情況時，即可想像今次哈爾賽艦隊之損豐程度矣。美海軍今後必執拗企圖奪回菲律賓，然日軍之反攻力，僅以此役可充分窺知，因大總統選舉之政略，不得不罔視戰略，開始行動之美海軍，實堪憐憫。同時顧慮今次作戰共二萬數千將兵之喪命時，實不禁鄧以同情。彼等已爲羅斯福政權之政略而犧牲，爲使選舉戰有利而施之作戰，反更釀成羅斯福苦戰之因素，實堪情憐憫也。</p>

<p>問　接照你的話說，蔣介石對於全面和平也就沒有發言權了，那末重慶豈不是沒有人能談全面和平了麼？　　答　你的話很對。目前公然脫穎而出，能夠談判全面和平的個人是沒有的，同時將來也不會有。在重慶的許多人士如不希望有全面和平的時候，蔣介石對於這一問題是一言不發的。縱令重慶政權內部不斷出現高唱全面和平和志士，但蔣介石也恐怕將是最後的一個吧。所以他發言的時候，就是重慶國策決定的時候。前此徘徊於上海及香港的中日政治掮客，全都像煞有介事地說過，蔣介石主張全面和平了。這批政治掮客把自己聽來的這種謊言講出去，藉混一點唾餘或酒錢，然而對於重慶政權的本質愈發認眞研究，則愈發知道世上受這種糊塗謊方所欺騙者，眞是糊塗程度無以復加。關於全面和平的問題，自然如說蔣介石毫無發言權，這也是錯誤。但蔣介石縱對此問題發言，那也不過是和平的原則。凡是散佈樂觀論，而說蔣介石表示具體意見者，他這並非出自眞正的政治動機，而是出自最卑鄙的其他動機。被這種言論所迷惑，爲了好奇而揮霍一筆款子，雖然無關大局，但全面和平本身卻決不會在酒樓茶館的閒談裹實現出來。同時，還會因此而把全面和平的正道蒙蔽，眞是令人痛心疾首。我認爲中日問題的解決關鍵，並非在中國，而是在日本。一言以蔽之，日本本身應當實行打動重慶政權內部有力者的政治。俗語說：[射人先射馬]，那末想把蔣介石爭取過來，就必須首先射蔣氏騎的政治馬。爲達到這一目的，就需要打動重慶政權內部的有力者，即蔣的周圍。但想打動蔣的周圍，則必須首先打動重慶政權的下層組織。欲打動重慶政權的下層組織，則同時必須打動中國一股知識份子。欲打動中國的一般知識</p>
<p>份子，如不同時打動中國的一般民衆，則徒自心勞日絀。欲打動中國的一般民衆，則首先必須打動上海的民衆。蔣介石一瞭解了中國的統治階級意志，是向某一方向轉動，政治重心是向某一方向移行時，則立刻就轉向新的重心，即移向新的勢力均衡，他是具有這樣敏捷行動的人物。　　總之，全面和平問題不想由上面來解決，而想由下面來解決的這種態度和思想，如不是以日本爲發祥地至轉運而中國，則距離具體談判全面和平的日子，尚渺茫無期。　　問　你說重慶政權的意向決定於民意，如此說來，重慶政權豈不成爲眞正的民主政府了麼？然而重應政權是否尊重民意，這大成問題。可以說，是完全不理睬民意的。　　答　一般說來，你話很對。重慶政權尚週談不到是奠基於國民之上的政權，而是代表中國統治階級綜合意志的一部份統治階級的政權。整個中國統治階級，對於企圖改善土地關係的農民意志，毫不尊重，這是事實。因爲各種形式的對農民剝削，就是維持中國統治階級的基本進賬。因此農村的剝削關係，在抗戰期內也毫未更動。耶德嘉·史密斯在[爲亞洲而戰]（The　B　ttle　for　Asia）　　　，關於揚于江不　　　　生活會有如下的事實報　：　　[高境地狙，種類繁多的苛捐雜稅，豈產品價格的一落千丈，高利貸與債台高築的壓迫，竟使某部最好土地白白讓人。綢絲價格跌落六成以上，結果農民不得不把重要的最後貯藏物拿出來用光，小地主及佃農不得不愈益仰賴高利貸生活。根據　博土著的[中國農民生活]（Peasant　life　in　China,　by　Fei　Hsio-Tung）一書的調查，該地（揚子江下流地域）各處的紳士，原則上都是政府任命的收稅人，而有交付地方官廳所擁派的款額之義務。因此佃農（事實上自己並不知道被攤派的捐稅數目）實際上不僅派常繳納地租，甚至地主應付的捐稅也要繳納，同時對於收稅人的地主，也不能不有特別獻金。　　由於這種關係，收稅人握有警察權，而對於不能繳納捐稅和地租的佃農，隨時可知以拘警。冬天不願去往　的佃農，只有求助於高利貸　放　于錢者與地主和收稅人往往是　　　　　　　　　的利　　　　　　　　　　以上，一年可　本金七　以上。　　前此的自由農民，有數百萬逐漸走向[無產階級化]，其理由不外直接產生於紳士，地主，收稅人三位一體的驚人剝削制度中：：]（一爲亞洲而戰]，一三六頁）。　　農村裹這種剝削機構，在抗戰期間仍被重慶政權所保存的原因，即因爲上述地主，紳士，收稅人是重慶政權地方組織的主要構成份子。這批人在文化方面就是開倒車的[國粹]擁護者。國民黨內部也不單純是這批人，還有在抗戰期間仍想解決農村問題的覺悟份子。然而他們懷疑，如按現狀從事改善這種土地關係，則很有可能使這類地主，紳士，收稅人脫離重慶政治，而原班人馬投到南京政府方面去。按一般中國統治階級說，從未想改善這種由來已久的剝削組織。所以代表統治階級綜合意志的蔣介石，在這一問題上決不尊重民意。　　此處所舉的實例都是主要的，至於抗戰區內這類相同現象，實不勝枚舉。所以你所說的重慶政權不尊重民意這一點，或許很對。但你不要忘記，蔣介石政權在其他關係上固然能夠強奸民意，然在決定對日媾和或抗戰到底的塲合上，則不能不尊重民意。中國民衆在其他問題上或許容易欺騙，但在這一問題上，八年的長期艱苦作戰業已備嘗了教訓，所以很難欺騙。（以上轉入第二版）</p>

<p>柏林十七日中央社電　海通社訊，軍事發言人昨稱：德軍大規模避離行動之目的，爲大量集中其實力，此項行動並非係決定採取守勢而言，蓋德軍司令部深知戰事決不能以守勢而獲勝。德軍現放棄一部份土地或整個國家，並非已放棄在該區作戰之意思。德軍自希臘撤退後，巴爾幹戰綫將有變化，該處之局勢尚未穩定，將於他日決定之，辦保聯軍之進攻，僅爲阻擾行動而已。　　柏林十七日中央社電　德國社訊：軍息，南斯拉夫京城貝爾格勒之德守軍，昨於激烈之巷戰中，擊毀敵坦克車多輛，將敵軍　至該市以南之郊外</p>

<p>（自第一版轉來）　　問　蔣介石不是藉強調[抗戰最後必勝]，而在拼命轉移民衆對民生問題的注意視綫麼？　　答　大有這種傾向。抗戰中國的民生問題，老實說並非經濟問題，而是政治問題。這就是國共兩黨爭取中國領導權鬥爭的主要政治戰塲。這自抗戰開始時延安就說：[爲爭取抗戰勝利，必須首先解決國內民生問題]。與此相反，重慶則根據[抗戰高於一切]的口號，而說此時如強調國內民生問題，而刺激階級鬥爭，就會妨碍戰爭的有利進行。當然，中國共產黨的意圖，是藉解決民主問題，以爭取民衆的信仰；藉動員民衆從事經濟門爭的壓力，而使重慶政權逐漸放棄獨裁，走上民主道路，最低限度可以說，是想使中國成爲聯合戰綫的國家。重慶很知道中國共產黨的這咱計畫，所以重慶對於民生民主兩大問題諱莫深，只在萬不得已時，才佯作一[民主姿態]，以欺騙民衆。因此，民生問題在抗戰區內並非單純是經濟問題，而是國共兩黨進行政治門爭的重要形態。直最到近，在這一政治門爭塲面上，中國共產黨因爲兩種理由，而取得了極端有利的立塲。第一，美國希望重慶政權民主化。自然，美國並不希望重慶政權像中共所要求的那樣民主化。因爲美國認爲那樣就會替共產主義開闢道路。但美國又恐怕重慶政權由現在包圍蔣介石的那批人來支配，時時都有與日本妥協的可能；此外美國還認爲親美派的宋子文和朱美齡非常可憐。加之，重慶政權如逐漸宗派化，而黨內完全由特務機關支配時，國民黨本身的內部也就不斷發生不滿現政府的現象。於是也就影響抗戰力量。如現在的重慶抗戰力弱不勝風，則美國駐華空軍基地就失掉保障；如中國無強大的美國空軍基地，則結束抗日戰爭，就始終遙遙無期。因此，目前無論如何應當打破重慶政權內部的國粹派專制政權，而讓英美派主持大政。這就是美國要求重慶政權民主化的眞實動機。　　第二，參政會要求重慶政權民主化。今日中國固然沒有一個人承認國民參政會是民主化的民意機關，然而國民參政會總算槓着一個帶[國民]字樣的招牌，所以就不得不談類似某種國民的要求。同時其中也有人，明知國民參政會的本質爲何物，但偏偏還要利用這條道路，盡力爲國民的要求而奮鬥。此外還有人因爲自己不能被蔣內閣所用，故意提出蔣介石所不能的國民要求來，吹毛求疵，排揚爲難。根據這種種動機，就不能不承認國民參政會在某種程度上是代表[民意]的。但[天下的烏鴉一般黑]，所以最近重慶也不例外，而完全被戰時通貸膨脹的狂風暴雨所籠罩了。薪水階級，低級公務員，教員，文化工作者等的生活，都飽受其蹂躪，而在茍延殘喘着。他們爲了[抗戰最後勝利]，固然犧牲一切在所不惜，但親眼看到同一抗陣戰營內竟有大發國難財者，如孔祥熙宋子文輩實令人感到是可忍孰不可忍。於是重慶民衆對於發國難財的人，就如火如茶地汛濫着憤慨情緒。在某種程度上代表此種民衆不滿情緒的此次參政會，會相當潑辣活躍地抨擊過政府。蔣介石爲了敷衍這一點就不得不作出一點事情來。於是他便在九月十六日國民參政會上所發表的演說中，會說出前方將士的待遇，最低限度應當提高到一般國民生活的水準，但並不因此而發行公債，而希望二千萬至三千萬石米糧抵充。這可以說，的確是民衆輿論所壓迨出來的[吭唷]聲。　　共產黨利用這種客觀形勢，而態度愈冀強硬，要求重慶政權和願國共合作，則首先應使重慶政權內部民主化。此時美國也加以逼迫和指責，爲什麼國共不迅速同舟共濟地合作起來。日本軍隊不管三七二十一，而只是勢如破竹地進攻着。於是蔣介石在政治上就碰到了大的難題。　　問　但常此以往，結局重慶政權將如何？　　答　只要日本政治不發生變化，在此高唱重慶政權民生化入雲的時期，蔣介石不會自抱奮勇，出而談判全面和平的，同時也不能希望聽其自然發展，全面和平會從天上掉下來。旣上述二者不可能，重慶政權自然就會與中共政權完全合作，進行[民主化]。　　問　你以前似乎說過，在重慶政權國粹派的傾向中，有全面和平的希望，但此次爲什麼又說沒有這種希望了呢？你的話眞令人不可捉摸。　　答　你從少年至青年的時期，會否有過經騐，痛恨社會上女人之多，而獨無愛人之感呢？當時並不是社會上沒有當你愛人的女性，而是因爲你尚年幼，不懂得接近女人的方法。同時縱令你懂得接近的方法，也許因爲你沒有付諸實施的勇氣。此外，還有一個原因，就是在你的眼光中，還沒發現眞正值得你愛慕的對象。等你長大成人，能夠吸引女性注意的時候，縱或你不想注意女人，而女人也會吸引你注意。日本和重慶的關係也與此相同。重慶正像十七八歲的姑娘想丈夫一樣地想全面和平。但日本正像情竇未開的少年不懂接近女性的方法，縱懂也無實行的勇氣，同時還沒取得女性眼光中眞正值得被愛慕的資格一樣，而日本不懂接近重慶政權的方法，縱懂也無實行的勇氣，且政策尚未達到勾引重慶政權注意的程度，所以全面和平的希望是很少的。根據這一點，我認爲假令宇垣先生這樣很懂問題的人，把中國實際情形透澈地加以觀察，然後回到日本把日本政治推進到某種程度，就可以的。如是則全面和平也決不至於是不可能的。　　總之，我的不能已於言者，即解決中日問題的關鍵，決不在於中國，而在於日本。許多人來中國視察，能找到解決中日問題關鍵的洞固然好，但如認爲關鍵在中國，則是不可饒恕的錯誤。同時就是回日本後，也不一定信手找到一把現成的合適鑰匙。我們日本人必須全國總動員，盡量提前作出這樣一把合適的鑰匙來。　　君子務本，本立而道生。（全文完）（魯譯）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Annihilating the Ambition of Britain and America <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, Mr. Tokutomi Sohō delivered a speech at the Tokyo Hōzan Seinen-dan (Patriotic Young Men's Group), stating that the methods used by Britain and America are only threefold: first, conquest; second, exclusive possession; and third, the extraction of profit. They have no other skills than wielding military force. They are simply unreasonable, so there is no better way to teach them than to fight, fight, fight again. It is not negotiation or compromise that will change their views, but only fighting. These few words fully explain the history of British and American aggression in East Asia, represent the roar of resistance from the entire Greater East Asia nation, express our deep understanding of the enemy, and our final determination for war.</p>
<p>Since the Opium War, China has never been without invasion. The Opium War was to use force to protect the British, to poison the body of the Chinese nation with opium, and to extract the money of the Chinese nation with opium. Since then, they have successively used the name of trade and the guise of investment to achieve their goals of political and economic aggression. In particular, the legal tender policy of Lytton Rosser in 1935 caused all of China's money to be moved to London and then to New York, and from then on, China's fate could not escape the trap of Britain and America. In 1937, Britain and America further provoked conflict between China and Japan, causing East Asian nations to kill each other, with the鹬蚌相争 (snipe and clam fighting) for the benefit of the British and Americans.</p>
<p>The ambition of Britain and America is to turn the entire Asia into Africa, into India. The land is only their colony, and the people are only their slaves. Their goal is to use political, economic, and cultural aggression to prevent us from ever standing up, and there is no second way to go except to surrender and be oppressed. The history of East Asia in the last hundred years is evidence of the aggressive ambitions of Britain and America, especially the Chinese nation living the most difficult and dangerous life under the ambitions of Britain and America.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War launched by the allied nation of Japan in the winter of 1941 is the highest awakening of the East Asian nation, making the East Asian nation recognize the enemy, making everyone know that killing each other only benefits the enemy, and making everyone know that mutual unity and attacking the only enemy is the way for the entire nation to survive. For the past three years, we have struck back at those who have struck at us, causing the British and American enemies to receive the greatest and deepest lessons, but to change their views and eliminate their ambitions for conquest, exclusive possession, and the extraction of profits, we still need to continue to work hard. In order to maintain the rights and interests they have gained through aggression over the past century, the enemy will surely use all their strength to oppress us, and we must also use all our strength to resist. As Mr. Tokutomi said: "[Only fight, until they prostrate themselves completely. There is no other thorough and satisfactory way to complete the war]".</p>
<p>Eliminating the ambitions of the British and American enemies means changing the enemy's psychology. To make the enemy abandon their aggressive ambitions, we must first make the enemy know that it is impossible to invade us. There is no other way to create this psychological change except by using the power of war. The Greater East Asia War is about to be three years old, and the enemy's losses are huge, which is self-inflicted and enough for the British and American ambitious politicians to realize. What we feel most ashamed of is that China has been participating in the war for nearly two years, and the cooperation in the war is really insignificant. We cannot fight alongside the allied soldiers at the front, can't we still work harder in the rear? Every time we read the words of the allied people who are determined to kill the enemy, we always feel ashamed of ourselves. I hope that every countryman will encourage themselves deeply.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Continues to Announce War Results of Destroying the Enemy Fleet. The Air Battle in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan Enters the Second Stage. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 17th: Japanese aircraft squadrons encountered and attacked the enemy's newly arrived mobile units in the waters east of Taiwan on the 16th, destroying one or more aircraft carriers and battleships.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Since the 12th, Japanese forces have encircled the enemy's mobile units in the waters east of Taiwan, giving them a crushing blow. According to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 17th, it is very clear that the enemy forces are mobilizing other mobile units to rescue in this area. These newly mobilized enemy mobile units are based on specially equipped aircraft carriers, accompanied by several standard aircraft carriers, battleships, and cruisers. After receiving the news that the enemy's mobile units were attacking, the Japanese Air Force immediately dispatched aircraft squadrons. After surrounding the enemy in the waters east of Taiwan on the 16th, they launched a fierce daytime attack. At 1:45 PM, the Japanese attack squadrons engaged in combat with more than 30 of the enemy's giant carrier-based fighters. After shooting down several of them, they charged into the enemy's airspace, repeatedly bombing an enemy aircraft carrier, a battleship, etc. Before long, one enemy aircraft carrier caught fire after being hit, and one battleship was destroyed and could not navigate. It has been confirmed that one enemy aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed. After achieving remarkable results, the Japanese aircraft squadrons returned to their original defenses.</p>
<p>Central News Agency – The brave Japanese fleet recently achieved an unprecedented victory in the waters east of Taiwan. According to informed military sources, the air and sea battle in the waters east of Taiwan has entered the second stage, and the Japanese Combined Fleet is currently searching and pursuing, and will definitely annihilate all the enemy ships remaining in the Pacific. Moreover, the remaining enemy ships have been severely damaged and are inconvenient to navigate, and a part of the Japanese Combined Fleet's surface fleet is now concentrating on the pursuit. Especially the Japanese bases in the South Seas, such as aircraft and fleets, are waiting for the enemy fleet to flee in a panic, and will annihilate them when they pass through the area. Therefore, these remaining enemy ships will definitely not be able to escape and will not be able to take a step beyond the thunder pond. As for the current situation of the enemy Americans, the annihilation of the main elite fleet, the deaths of the navy, and the destruction of aircraft are difficult to remedy, especially the supply of guns, ammunition, and weapons is extremely difficult. Therefore, the enemy Americans are becoming more and more difficult and serious in these two aspects. Looking again at the great war results of the Japanese army, it is because Japan's own production has reached a fully perfect state, which is a factor in achieving great war results. At the same time, these war results are also the good results of the Japanese people's efforts and struggles. After examining that the main elite forces of the enemy's American Pacific Fleet are on the verge of complete annihilation, we must never be proud of this, but should make further efforts to redouble our efforts until the enemy Americans are annihilated. However, although the enemy's main forces in the Pacific have been annihilated, the American air force in Chongqing on the Chinese mainland will inevitably have sinister intentions. As for how the enemy's British fleet in the Indian Ocean will act in the future, Japan has always been paying attention to it. The great war results this time will give the Allied Germany a boost, give the Soviet Union a good impression, and give the national people of the Philippines greater self-confidence.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Battle of the Taiwan Sea Lays the Foundation for the Decisive Victory <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>President Zhou Expresses Congratulations to the Allies</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th – Premier Zhou of the Executive Yuan issued the following statement regarding the Allied victory after the Battle of the Eastern Sea of Taiwan: The Allies have defeated the American Navy in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan, sinking many of its aircraft carriers and capital ships. The American fleet was defeated and routed. The good news has spread, and all levels of our government and people are deeply celebrating. Since the American Navy seized the islands of Saipan and Guam, they were complacent and believed that the Japanese Navy had no combat power. Therefore, they carelessly advanced, repeatedly harassed the islands of Ogasawara, Palau, and the Philippines, and invaded Taiwan. How could they know that the reason why the Japanese main fleet was hiding and not coming out was precisely to foster the arrogance of the American Navy, quietly waiting for a good opportunity to annihilate it in one fell swoop. The highest principle of the Japanese Navy is not to lightly come out unless it is in the waters near Japan. This battle of Taiwan had the advantages of天时 (timely opportunity), 地利 (geographical advantage), and 人和 (harmony of the people). Therefore, it was able to win in one battle. The so-called timely opportunity refers to the maturity of the timing. The so-called geographical advantage refers to being close to the homeland and waiting at ease. The so-called harmony of the people refers to the fact that after the fall of the islands of Saipan and Guam, all the officers and soldiers held the same hatred for the enemy, vowing to avenge the shame of the defeat at Wu. "An army burning with righteous indignation will surely win," the ancient saying is clear. Although this battle cannot yet be regarded as a decisive battle, it can be compared to the Battle of Tsushima in the Russo-Japanese War. The name of the Japanese "invincible navy" has been further established, and after obtaining this great victory, the belief in certain victory has become even firmer, and there is more confidence in the victory of the Greater East Asia War. However, although the American Navy will not dare to attack again for a while after this defeat, it may soon make a comeback. The Allies are of course prepared for this. With the status of an allied nation, in addition to expressing our heartfelt congratulations on this victory and paying our respects to the Allied officers and soldiers, we should also work together to complete the Greater East Asia War with the spirit of sharing life and death, in order to ensure the liberation of East Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Contents of the US 58th Mobile Task Force Composition <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The American 58th Mobile Task Force, which was defeated and fled in the waters east of Taiwan, was formed for the Pacific counter-offensive and war, with a strong group of new-style aircraft carriers as its main force, along with capital ships, auxiliary ships, and large supply fleets, commanded by Mitscher. This large mobile task force is assigned to the Fifth Fleet when it operates in the Pacific to cover the Japanese offensive, called the 58th Mobile Task Force of the Fifth Fleet, and to the Third Fleet when it operates in the southwestern Pacific, called the 38th Mobile Task Force of the Third Fleet. This time, due to joint operations with the Third Fleet, the United States calls it the 38th Mobile Task Force. Regarding the composition of this force, the United States Navy Department said on June 23 that the United States Navy announced that the 58th Mobile Task Force, which is currently operating in Saipan, covered the landing operations on the Gilbert Islands last year and the Marshall Islands in February of this year, and cooperated with MacArthur in the landing in the Dutch region, and twice attacked Truk, Palau, Ogasawara, and Iwo Jima. The firepower of this fleet is equivalent to 70 units of the US military's standard artillery, equipped with about 850 various cannons, such as huge coastal batteries. The 58th Fleet is also known as the Fleet Train, which can go from the home country to distant seas for combat, and is called the "Lend-Lease Fleet". This mobile task force can be supplied with fuel, food, and replacement pilots wherever it goes. The total sliding area of the entire fleet is 1.25 million square feet, and it can dispatch 1,000 carrier-based aircraft.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, a certain base in China, 17th – The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, composed of about 50 B24 and P51 fighter planes, formed a joint formation to attack Guangzhou in the evening of the 15th. The Japanese fighter squadron immediately intercepted them and launched a fierce air battle over Guangzhou. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft pursued the enemy who was trying to escape to the west and severely damaged them near Sanshui. As of now, the confirmed war results include two B24 aircraft and five P51 aircraft shot down, one B24 aircraft and one P51 aircraft destroyed, totaling nine aircraft. In this battle, four Japanese aircraft also did not return.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 17th – The Hong Kong Garrison Headquarters reported on the 16th at 5:00 PM: At 3:30 PM on the 16th, a joint formation of dozens of fighter-bombers from the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing invaded Hong Kong airspace, but they were intercepted by the Japanese army and immediately fled. In this battle, two enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Manila and Kaohsiung Air Raided the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – After the Mitscher force was defeated in the waters of Taiwan, a powerful new American mobile task force appeared in the Eastern Sea of Taiwan on the 16th to rescue it and collect the remaining ships and boats, and was immediately subjected to the first attack by the Japanese Air Force, as a result, one aircraft carrier and one battleship were destroyed. According to reports, that mobile task force attacked the vicinity of Manila with about 150 carrier-based aircraft on the morning of the 16th, and on the same day in the afternoon, about 25 B29 aircraft from the Chinese mainland bombed the vicinity of Kaohsiung, Taiwan, for about 30 minutes before retreating. The original mission of this mobile task force was to be the rearguard of Mitscher and to serve as the second attack force, but due to the changing war situation, it had to take on the mission of collecting the Mitscher force. The air raids on Manila and Kaohsiung were actions taken to cover its collection work. The results of the air battle are still being determined.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Mr. Okazaki, Director of the Japanese Public Information Department, Issued a Statement <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – Mr. Okazaki Hiro, Director of the Japanese Public Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, especially spoke today on the impact of the American Navy's disastrous defeat on the Roosevelt administration, and issued a statement as follows: The Japanese army has repeatedly said that when the American army is led to near the land bases, it will be subjected to counter-attacks. Judging from the war in Taiwan, it can be said that its words are not false. The American Navy, overconfident in its own combat power, launched a surprise attack on the presidential election strategy, disregarding strategy, and attacked near the Japanese mainland. As a result, its dreams did not come true, but it suffered a disastrous defeat. When the American army attacked the southwestern islands of Japan, it initially made a big propaganda about its air raids on Okinawa and Taiwan, and broadcast that the damage to the American air force was slight and that there was no damage to the warships. However, as the war situation changed drastically, the propaganda seemed to be silent. As for the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters this time, it did not refute a word. Its doctrine of concealing what is unfavorable to its own country has been a long-standing skill of the Roosevelt government since the Coral Sea and Solomon Sea battles, and this time it is also facing the presidential election battle, so its anxieties are even more profound. Prohibiting the publication of the Japanese war results or making the minimum possible publication is to deceive the eyes and ears of the people. However, no matter how the American government conceals the eyes and ears of the people, if one pays attention to the situation of the future war against Japan, one can imagine the extent of the damage to Halsey's fleet this time. The American Navy will inevitably stubbornly try to regain the Philippines, but the Japanese army's counter-attack power can be fully seen from this battle. It is to be pitied that the American Navy had to disregard strategy and start actions because of the presidential election strategy. At the same time, considering the loss of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers in this battle, one cannot help but feel sympathy. They have been sacrificed for the Roosevelt administration's political strategy, and the operation to make the election battle favorable has instead become a factor in Roosevelt's difficult battle, which is worthy of pity.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime (Part 2) <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>Question: According to you, Chiang Kai-shek has no say in a comprehensive peace. Doesn't that mean that no one in Chongqing can talk about a comprehensive peace?</p>
<p>Answer: You are quite right. At present, there is no individual who can openly come forward to negotiate a comprehensive peace, nor will there be in the future. If many people in Chongqing do not desire a comprehensive peace, Chiang Kai-shek will not say a word on the issue. Even if there are constantly patriots within the Chongqing regime advocating for a comprehensive peace, Chiang Kai-shek will probably be the last one to do so. Therefore, when he speaks, it is the moment when Chongqing's national policy is decided. Previously, the Sino-Japanese political brokers who lingered in Shanghai and Hong Kong all said with an air of importance that Chiang Kai-shek advocated a comprehensive peace. These political brokers spread such lies they heard, hoping to get some scraps or drinking money. However, the more one earnestly studies the essence of the Chongqing regime, the more one realizes that those deceived by such muddled lies are truly extraordinarily muddled. Of course, it is also wrong to say that Chiang Kai-shek has no say in the matter of a comprehensive peace at all. But even if Chiang Kai-shek speaks on this issue, it will only be about the principles of peace. Anyone who spreads optimism and says that Chiang Kai-shek has expressed concrete opinions is not driven by genuine political motives but by the most despicable other motives. Although being misled by such arguments and spending a sum of money out of curiosity does not affect the overall situation, a comprehensive peace itself will never be realized through idle talk in restaurants and teahouses. At the same time, it will also obscure the right path to a comprehensive peace, which is truly heartbreaking. I believe that the key to resolving the Sino-Japanese issue does not lie in China but in Japan. In a word, Japan itself should implement a policy of influencing the powerful figures within the Chongqing regime. As the saying goes, "To shoot a man, first shoot his horse." If you want to win over Chiang Kai-shek, you must first shoot the political horse Chiang rides. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to influence the powerful figures within the Chongqing regime, that is, those around Chiang. But to influence those around Chiang, it is necessary to first influence the lower-level organizations of the Chongqing regime. To influence the lower-level organizations of the Chongqing regime, it is also necessary to influence a group of Chinese intellectuals at the same time. If you want to influence the general Chinese intellectuals</p>
<p>without simultaneously influencing the general Chinese masses, it will only be a waste of effort. If you want to influence the general Chinese masses, you must first influence the masses in Shanghai. Once Chiang Kai-shek understands that the will of the Chinese ruling class is turning in a certain direction and that the political center is shifting in a certain direction, he will immediately turn to the new center, that is, shift to the new balance of power. He is a person with such agile actions. In short, if this attitude and thought of not wanting to solve the problem of comprehensive peace from above but wanting to solve it from below does not originate and spread from Japan to China, then the day for concrete negotiations on a comprehensive peace is still far and uncertain.</p>
<p>Question: You say that the intentions of the Chongqing regime are determined by public opinion. Does that mean that the Chongqing regime has become a true democratic government? However, whether the Chongqing regime respects public opinion is a big question. It can be said that it completely ignores public opinion.</p>
<p>Answer: Generally speaking, you are right. The Chongqing regime cannot yet be said to be a regime based on the people. Instead, it is a regime representing the collective will of a part of the Chinese ruling class. It is a fact that the entire Chinese ruling class does not respect the will of the peasants who attempt to improve land relations. This is because various forms of exploitation of peasants are the basic source of income for maintaining the Chinese ruling class. Therefore, the exploitative relationship in rural areas has not changed at all during the War of Resistance. Edgar Snow in "[Battle for Asia]" reported the following facts about life in the Yangtze River area: "[In a high-tax environment, a wide variety of exorbitant taxes and levies, and plummeting product prices, the oppression of usury and debt have caused some of the best land to be given away for nothing. The price of silk has fallen by more than 60%, forcing farmers to deplete their important final savings, and small landowners and tenant farmers have had to rely increasingly on usury to survive. According to the research in Dr. Fei Hsio-Tung's book, [Peasant Life in China], the gentry in the area (the lower reaches of the Yangtze River) are, in principle, tax collectors appointed by the government and are obliged to pay the amount designated by the local government. Therefore, the tenant farmers (who in fact do not know the amount of taxes levied on them) actually pay not only the rent but also the taxes that the landlords should pay. At the same time, they must also make special contributions to the landlords who are tax collectors. Due to this relationship, tax collectors wield police power and can arrest tenant farmers who cannot pay taxes and rent at any time. Tenant farmers who do not want to go to jail in the winter have to resort to usury. Those who lend money are often in collusion with landlords and tax collectors. The interest rates are often above 30%, and the principal can be recovered more than 7 times a year. Millions of former free peasants have gradually become 'proletarianized.' The reason is none other than the shocking exploitation system directly created by the gentry, landlords, and tax collectors as a trinity:] ([Battle for Asia], p. 136)." The reason why this exploitative mechanism in rural areas was preserved by the Chongqing regime during the War of Resistance is that the aforementioned landlords, gentry, and tax collectors are the main components of the Chongqing regime's local organization. In cultural terms, these people are supporters of regressive "[National Essence]." The Kuomintang is not only composed of these people; there are also enlightened individuals who still want to solve the rural problem during the War of Resistance. However, they worry that if they try to improve this land relationship under the current circumstances, it is very likely that these landlords, gentry, and tax collectors will leave Chongqing politics and join the Nanjing government with their original personnel. Generally speaking, the Chinese ruling class has never wanted to improve this long-standing exploitative organization. Therefore, Chiang Kai-shek, who represents the collective will of the ruling class, never respects public opinion on this issue. The examples cited here are all major ones. As for similar phenomena in the war zones, they are too numerous to list. Therefore, what you said about the Chongqing regime not respecting public opinion may be correct. But do not forget that while the Chiang Kai-shek regime can force public opinion on other matters, it cannot but respect public opinion when deciding whether to negotiate peace with Japan or fight to the end. The Chinese masses may be easily deceived on other issues, but on this issue, they have already learned their lesson through eight years of long and arduous warfare, so it is difficult to deceive them.

<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports that a military spokesman stated yesterday: The purpose of the German army's large-scale withdrawal is to concentrate its forces in large numbers. This action does not mean that a defensive posture has been decided upon, as the German General Staff is well aware that the war cannot be won with a defensive posture. The German army is now abandoning parts of its land or entire countries, which does not mean that it has abandoned the idea of fighting in the area. The Balkan front will change after the German retreat from Greece. The situation there has not yet stabilized and will be decided at a later date. The Allied offensive is only an obstructionist action.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): German News Agency reports: Military news, the German garrison in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, destroyed many enemy tanks in fierce street battles yesterday, driving the enemy forces to the southern suburbs of the city.</p>

<p>Geneva, 17th (Central News Agency): German News Agency reports: "[Lausanne Gazette]" wrote on Sunday that London believes that the position of the Supreme Commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeastern Europe will be filled by Marshal Tobukhin, the commander of the Third Ukrainian Front. If so, future developments there will soon become clear.</p>

<p>Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency): Huitong News Agency reports: The Soviet army continues its offensive along a 3,000-kilometer-long front, with only the center shifting from time to time. After the German army abandoned Riga, it continued its withdrawal in an orderly manner, and the rear guard units on the banks of the Tevina River have also completed their retreat. The main battle center in the central section of the Eastern Front is still in Serotsk and Ozan. There is also fierce fighting south of the Bug River. Although the German forces in the Nakiff area are strong, the enemy has broken into East Prussia. In the Hungarian war, the Soviet army has strengthened its northern flank forces and intensified its encirclement attempts. The battle in the Eastern Beskids (Bckides) is becoming increasingly fierce. The enemy's goal is to seize the Dukla Pass, east of which the Southern Highway leads to Galicia, so the pass is strategically important. The German-Hungarian garrison has repeatedly repelled the enemy's frontal and flanking offensives in a flexible manner, preventing the enemy from breaking into Slovakia. The large-scale tank battles in Groswardein and Tebresen continue. The war in Serbia is moving south of Belgrade, and the German forces in Nish are continuing to retreat.</p>

<p>Mr. Yuuki, the economic advisor to the Japanese cabinet, came to Shanghai from Kyoto a few days ago. Yesterday (the 17th) at 11:00 AM, he met with the Chinese newspaper reporters in the city on the ninth floor of the Cathay Hotel to express his impressions of coming to China. He stated: "[I had planned to meet with the newspaper reporters in the capital, but I was unable to do so because I had to go to a town on official business that day. I am very sorry. If it is convenient for you, please convey my regards on my behalf. This is my first time in China. I first went to Nanjing and then came to Shanghai from Kyoto. My understanding of China is still shallow, and I have no particular opinions to express. I plan to visit important figures in your country to listen to their insights before organizing my thoughts. When I was in Japan, I heard that your country has cooperated greatly in strengthening our country's war effort, and I am extremely pleased and grateful. The current war is becoming increasingly fierce and entering a decisive stage. Under this wartime system, I sincerely hope that your country can provide further assistance to expedite the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War is a holy war to win the liberation of all East Asian nations. Judging from the purpose of the war and the spirit of our country's army and navy, I am confident that no matter how tortuous the war situation may be in the future, or how the world situation may evolve, the victory of the war is assured for our East Asian nations. I have firm belief in this and sincerely hope that the government and the public in your country can also share this belief, work together with Japan, and move towards a common goal. To achieve the ultimate goal of the war, many problems will inevitably arise in politics and economics. However, I believe that this is not absolutely difficult. If we have the belief that we are fighting for the liberation of East Asian nations, we will surely achieve ultimate victory.]"</p>

<p>The Silk Industry Trade Association learned that the autumn cocoons in the production areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have already entered the market, and the member silk factories urgently need funds to purchase the autumn cocoons. Therefore, they specifically borrowed a loan of 50 million yuan for purchasing cocoons from the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banking groups in the city. After several discussions and confirmations, the loan agreement was signed by both parties at the Douchang Hotel at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 17th). This loan is still conducted in the form of acceptance drafts, and the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to handle the rediscounting. All loan responsibilities are fully guaranteed and managed by the Silk Industry Trade Association. The loan term is stipulated to be three months, with full repayment.</p>

<p>In order to announce the work status of the Shanghai Radio Station, the Chinese Broadcasting Association specifically invited the news reporters in the city and Mr. Liang Xiuyu, the director of the Municipal Propaganda Office, to attend the meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 17th). During the meeting, Director Chen Zhengzhang gave a speech and explained the reasons for the increase in listening fees. The reason is that all expenses are huge, and starting in October, the fee will be increased from 30 yuan to 100 yuan. The second reason for the modification of radios is that in the past, designated radio shops were entrusted to handle it, but many did not comply with legal procedures. Therefore, the Association will handle it itself, charging only a modification fee of 300 yuan. When the Association sends personnel to investigate outside, their attitude will be absolutely amiable. Third, the recent work of the Shanghai Radio Station plans to expand entertainment programs. Fourth, Shanghai is the economic center of the country, and there are plans to broadcast Shanghai economic news to Nanjing and the Central China area on the same day.</p>

<p>The Municipal Land Administration Bureau states that the number of people mortgaging or receiving mortgages on land certificates in the city is increasing day by day. However, the above procedures should be registered with the Bureau in accordance with the regulations beforehand. However, it has been found that most people do not understand the benefits of registration and are indifferent to it, resulting in the mortgagor falsely reporting the loss of the land certificate to the Bureau, applying for a replacement in an attempt to deny the mortgage, or the mortgagee impersonating the mortgagor and secretly selling and transferring the land certificate. The Land Administration Bureau has found this from time to time. Once it becomes a fact, disputes will inevitably arise. Therefore, in order to protect the rights and interests of both parties, they should promptly go to the Land Administration Bureau together for registration.</p>

Indeed, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the news of the brilliant war results on October 16. Our gratitude for this news is beyond words. The five million people in the city must make every effort to defend Shanghai. The enemy's mobile units, in cooperation with the US Air Force in China, sent a large number of enemy planes to appear in the waters east of Taiwan, attempting to air raid the entire island of Taiwan. From the 12th, they bombed various places for two days. The islanders were able to unite and cooperate with military officers and civilians to complete the civil air defense tasks. This could not have been achieved without thorough training. The air defense responsibility of the citizens of Shanghai is becoming increasingly heavy. We hope that the public will thoroughly understand this and make efforts to prepare for self-defense."</p>

<p>The Committee Will Review and Increase Electricity Allocation: The Municipal Economic Bureau conducted a registration for the electricity consumption and production volume of factories throughout the city last month. After investigating and reviewing the manufacturers related to daily necessities and military production, it appropriately increased the electricity allocation. The application for registration was closed at the end of last month. In total, about 3,000 major manufacturers in the city registered. The Bureau has already sent an official letter to the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and the Central China Water and Electricity Company, selecting specialized technical personnel to form a city-wide factory production volume and electricity consumption investigation team to conduct detailed investigations and provide guidance on electricity consumption and production in factories, in order to achieve the most economical electricity consumption and generate the greatest efficiency. The team is divided into three groups, with three people in each group: the first group includes Ma Pu'en (Economic Bureau), Wu Zuquan (Public Utilities Bureau), and Qu Xilian (Central China Water and Electricity Company); the second group includes Zhao Ruhuang (Economic Bureau), Gui Yimin (Public Utilities Bureau), and Shi Meizhang (Central China Water and Electricity Company); the third group includes Wang Hao (Economic Bureau), Huang Xiangtao (Public Utilities Bureau), and Li Shanyuan (Central China Water and Electricity Company). They began to investigate the factories throughout the city in groups on the 11th of this month. They are currently investigating various factories such as machinery and metal repair. Any errors found in factories that have not applied for registration or have improper electricity usage methods will be corrected immediately. Once the team completes the investigation, the committee organized by the authorities will review the results and increase the electricity allocation accordingly.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry's Fisheries Administration Bureau, because the standard division of duties between the Fisheries Administration Bureau and the provincial and municipal grain bureaus regarding aquatic matters, as stipulated by the former Ministry of Food, transferred the Bureau's power to supervise fish markets in various places to the provincial and municipal grain bureaus. Now, in order to adapt to the wartime environment and strengthen administrative efficiency, the central government has abolished the provincial and municipal grain bureaus. The Bureau will submit a request to the Ministry of Industry to forward it to the Executive Yuan to abolish the aforementioned standard, so that the right to supervise fish markets in various places will be restored to the Bureau. The Executive Yuan has approved the request in its directive of September 25, 1944, and the Ministry of Industry has instructed the Bureau to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Further Discussion on the Chongqing Regime <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Continued from the First Page)  Question: Isn't Chiang Kai-shek desperately trying to divert public attention from livelihood issues by emphasizing [the inevitable final victory of the War of Resistance]? Answer: There is a strong tendency towards this. Honestly speaking, China's livelihood issues during the War of Resistance are not economic problems, but political problems. This is the main political battlefield in the struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party for the leadership of China. Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, Yan'an has said: [To win the War of Resistance, it is necessary to first solve the domestic livelihood problems]. In contrast, Chongqing, based on the slogan of [Resistance War above all else], argues that emphasizing domestic livelihood issues at this time, and stimulating class struggle, would hinder the favorable progress of the war. Of course, the intention of the Chinese Communist Party is to win the faith of the people by solving democratic problems; by mobilizing the people to engage in economic pressure, to gradually abandon dictatorship and embark on a democratic path, at the very least, it can be said that they want to make China a united front country. Chongqing knows very well about this plan of the Chinese Communist Party, so Chongqing is deeply secretive about the two major issues of livelihood and democracy, only pretending to make a [democratic gesture] to deceive the public when absolutely necessary. Therefore, livelihood problems in the war zone are not simply economic problems, but an important form of political struggle between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Until recently, on this political battlefield, the Chinese Communist Party has gained an extremely favorable position for two reasons. First, the United States hopes that the Chongqing regime will be democratized. Of course, the United States does not want the Chongqing regime to be as democratized as the CCP demands. Because the United States believes that would pave the way for communism. But the United States is also afraid that the Chongqing regime will be dominated by the group of people surrounding Chiang Kai-shek, and there is always the possibility of compromise with Japan; in addition, the United States also considers the pro-American Song Ziwen and Zhu Meiling to be very pitiful. In addition, if the Chongqing regime gradually becomes sectarian and the party is completely dominated by special agencies, dissatisfaction with the current government will continue to arise within the Kuomintang itself. Thus, it also affects the power of resistance. If the current Chongqing resistance force is weak and cannot withstand the wind, then the US air base in China will lose its guarantee; if China does not have a strong US air base, then the end of the Anti-Japanese War will always be far away. Therefore, at present, the autocratic regime of the national essence faction within the Chongqing regime must be broken down, and the Anglo-American faction must preside over the major affairs. This is the true motive of the United States in demanding the democratization of the Chongqing regime. Second, the People's Political Council demands the democratization of the Chongqing regime. Today, no one in China admits that the National Political Council is a democratized public opinion organ, but the National Political Council is always carrying a sign with the word [National], so it has to talk about something similar to the demands of the people. At the same time, some of them know exactly what the essence of the National Political Council is, but they insist on using this path to do their best to fight for the demands of the people. In addition, there are also people who, because they cannot be used by Chiang's cabinet, deliberately raise the national demands that Chiang Kai-shek cannot meet, nitpicking and making things difficult. Based on these various motives, it cannot be denied that the National Political Council represents [public opinion] to a certain extent. However, [crows are all black under the sky], so recently Chongqing is no exception, and is completely shrouded in the storm of wartime inflation. The lives of salaried workers, low-level civil servants, teachers, and cultural workers are all ravaged by it and are struggling to survive. They are willing to sacrifice everything for [the final victory of the War of Resistance], but seeing with their own eyes that there are people in the same anti-Japanese camp who are making a fortune from the national crisis, such as Kong Xiangxi and Song Ziwen, it is really unbearable. Therefore, the people of Chongqing are flooding with indignation towards those who make a fortune from the national crisis like wildfire. To a certain extent, this People's Political Council, which represents this kind of public dissatisfaction, has criticized the government quite vigorously and actively. Chiang Kai-shek had to do something to perfunctorily deal with this point. Therefore, in his speech at the National Political Council on September 16, he said that the treatment of the soldiers at the front should be raised to the level of the general public at the very least, but he did not issue public bonds for this, but hoped to use 20 to 30 million stones of rice to offset it. This can be said to be a [groan] squeezed out by public opinion. The Communist Party took advantage of this objective situation, and its attitude became more and more tough, demanding that the Chongqing regime and the country should cooperate between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, then the internal democratization of the Chongqing regime should be carried out first. At this time, the United States also pressured and accused them, why the Kuomintang and the Communist Party did not quickly cooperate together in the same boat. The Japanese army did not care about anything, but just attacked like a broken bamboo. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek encountered a major political problem. Question: But if this continues, what will be the end result of the Chongqing regime? Answer: As long as there are no political changes in Japan, during this period of high-pitched calls for the livelihoodization of the Chongqing regime, Chiang Kai-shek will not bravely come forward and negotiate a comprehensive peace, and at the same time, it cannot be hoped that a comprehensive peace will fall from the sky if it is allowed to develop naturally. Since the above two are impossible, the Chongqing regime will naturally fully cooperate with the CCP regime and carry out [democratization]. Question: You seemed to have said before that there was hope for a comprehensive peace in the national essence faction's tendency of the Chongqing regime, but why do you say that there is no such hope this time? Your words are really elusive. Answer: From your youth to your adulthood, have you ever experienced the feeling of hating the number of women in society, but having no feeling of love? At that time, it was not that there were no women in society who could be your lover, but because you were still young and did not know how to approach women. At the same time, even if you know how to approach them, maybe you don't have the courage to put it into practice. In addition, there is another reason, that is, in your eyes, you have not found a truly worthy object of your love. When you grow up and are able to attract the attention of women, even if you don't want to pay attention to women, women will also attract your attention. The relationship between Japan and Chongqing is the same. Chongqing longs for a comprehensive peace just like a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl wants a husband. But Japan, like a young man who has not yet opened his heart, does not know how to approach women, even if he knows, he has no courage to implement it, and at the same time, he has not obtained the qualifications worthy of being admired in the eyes of women, Japan does not know how to approach the Chongqing regime, even if he knows, he has no courage to implement it, and the policy has not yet reached the level of attracting the attention of the Chongqing regime, so the hope of a comprehensive peace is very small. Based on this point, I think that if Mr. Ugaki, a person who understands the problem very well, thoroughly observes the actual situation in China, and then returns to Japan to advance Japanese politics to a certain extent, it will be possible. If so, then a comprehensive peace will never be impossible. In short, what I cannot help but say is that the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem lies not in China, but in Japan. It is good for many people to come to China for inspection and find a hole in the key to solving the Sino-Japanese problem, but it is an unforgivable mistake to think that the key is in China. At the same time, even after returning to Japan, it is not necessarily possible to find a ready-made suitable key. We Japanese must mobilize the whole country and make such a suitable key as early as possible. A gentleman devotes himself to the fundamentals. When the fundamentals are established, the Way arises.
