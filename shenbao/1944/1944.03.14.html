<h3>顧寶衡周乃文免職以後</h3>
<p>昨天報載國民政府命令：「查江蘇糧食局局長后大樁（按后兼任江蘇省黨部主委），糧食部水產管理局局長兼建設部郵政儲金滙業局局長胡政，在作戰期間，採辦軍糧，有重大舞事，着即撤職，交特別法庭從嚴審究，依法懲治。」又：「查后大椿，胡政舞弊一案，糧食部部長顧寳衡，次長周乃文，涉有嫌疑，着即先行免職，交特別法庭秉公審理。」我們站在人民立塲，讀了這兩個命令，頓然間覺得胸頭一舒。同時，我們認為這兩個命令，是國民政府還都以來第一件賢明措置，是最近國民政　革新政治，樹立信譽的第一聲，本　　必須有是非，有賞罰，才能使政治上軌道，這次是很重要的轉捩之點，希望政府當局重視之，把握之。</p>
<p>從令又上分析，前者是一舞弊」而「撤職」，而「從嚴審究」。後者是「涉嫌」而「免職」而「秉公審理」。顯然有輕重的區別。可是很慚愧的，我們從側面聽到后胡案件，是由盟邦蘇州憲兵隊檢舉的，我們認為顧寳衡周乃文是主管糧食的最高官吏，而后大樁胡政有連襟的親屬關係，又是顧周的親信，是直接下屬，親信下屬所做的重大舞弊，上司不會默然無聞的吧。因此，后胡的膽大妄為，是先得顧周的包庇。無疑的顧周后胡有一邱之貉的關係，后胡是實行舞弊者，顧周是幕後支援奢，總之，四位一體，勾通舞弊而已。縱使退一步言，屬員有重大舞弊，長官未加察覺檢舉，則縱容失察之責，已够嚴重，無可諉卸予。所以，今天我們特以「顧寳衡周乃文免職以後」為題，在於重視顧周應負的罪責，決非「涉嫌」，實質上更重於后胡的罪責，這是我們提供主持特別法庭諸公的意見。</p>
<p>不久以前，本市市府要員耿嘉基自殺，傳與后案有關，聞耿氏被左右朦蔽作弊，結果案情暴露，深悟責任重大，無以自謀，卒以一死了之。今后胡姑置不談，試問顧周兩人捫心自問，將何以自處。</p>
<p>於此，我們對於后胡案有如下的感想</p>
<p>盟邦憲兵當局，對於此案，能不避嫌怨，不問高官，秉公檢舉，我們的感謝，不僅在於因此使貪汚官吏寒心，尤在於促成中國澄淸吏治的發始。這是盟邦强化國民政府最具體最能見諸實效的舉措。</p>
<p>人事健全，還是革新政治，尤其是辦理糧政的中心，操守廉潔，律己奉公，原應為公務人員的守則。在上者尤須考察下屬，發現舞弊時，尤應不徇私情，從速檢舉。况且，如顧局之流，無論從政治經騐，聲望資歷以言，不足以當中樞重任，尤其是關係民生的糧政大事。這是政府用人不愼重的缺點。所以，希望政府方而，以嚴究后案為發端，肅淸貪汚，監察當局，行使彈　任務，司法當局，發揮檢察使命，縱橫相輔，共向澄淸吏治革新政治的坦途急進。</p>
<p>后胡舞弊的是軍糧，固屬重要。而負責辦理民食的機構，如米糧統制委員會等，其重要性實無二致。而米糧統制事務，最易使操守不穩者發生舞弊行為。過去米統會職員也有舞弊事實，而尙求聞有澈查嚴懲之事，實為最足遺憾者。同時，無論軍糧與民食，都是性命所繫的大事，辦理「糧政」者，一定要深具戒心而規規矩矩的從事工作。寄語糧統會當局以及從業人員，以后胡顧周案件為殷鑑，兢業從公，不為小利所誘，貽誤前程。</p>
<h3>日軍在溪谷方面正展開防衛攻勢敵軍補給道路已完全斷絕</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電據緬甸前綫某基地電，日軍在琴丘嶺地帶隊集結兵力在福特瓦脫前方及伊薩羅河上游山岳地帶據守堅固陣地，企　抵抗，且敵軍均在高五千尺至八千尺之山頂　築圓形陣地，在正面配　各　砲火，此種陣地均築有通後方之補給道路，地形竣險，完全斷絕側面連絡，故每一山頂均成孤立狀態。日軍精銳部隊最善於密林奇襲作戰，使敵軍大受威脋，現英印軍經日軍之空陸一致猛攻，不久富被　滅</p>
<p>仰光十三日中央社電印細國境琴丘　地帶概况，目下日軍正於印　國境琴丘嶺地帶作戰（琴字係　語為未開化之意），該地帶乃　嶺重　，文化阻塞之神秘處所，該地帶位於阿拉坎山脈中部，印細國境之申央，實天然之軍事要聞，四五千英尺之高峯，連綿起伏，間以溪谷，時復有廣大密林　　山中，大東亞戰前，該地帶未嘗被人重視，以地獪險，交通不便，　少有行人往來。緬甸作戰英印軍敗退後，即在印緬國境一帶構築陣地，於是亞洲秘境之琴丘嶺地帶，始著稱於世，該地帶氣候變化甚鉅，每年十一月迄翌年四月為乾燥季節，秋冬春三季轉瞬即過，餘則漫漫長夏，冬季最冷，各處常見下雪，盡間熱昇至一百三四十度，夜間降至另度，氣候奇特之至，以故常有瘧症·虎疫·鼠疫流行。該地帶所住之琴人，約有三十六萬，大體均在馬尼布爾河沿岸，身材短小，性質剽悍，近因英國企圖獲取該地帶豐富之森林資源，謀藉基督敎似柔琴人，但徒自招得琴人反感。大東亞戰前，曾為琴人指導者惡辣之英人瓦斯巴少校，至戰事勃發時，突然失蹤，生死不明，殆係為復仇心切之琴人所殺害也。且該地帶闢有公路，此乃琴人犠牲汗之結晶，琴人對於英人之不人道，已恨之入骨，刻該秘境民族，亦將由日軍自英國桎梏中予以解放。</p>
<p>中樞舉行週會</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電國府於本月十三日上午十時，在大禮堂舉行週會。文官參軍兩處職員全體參加，由徐文官長主席，行禮如儀後，繼即報吿「廉潔政治」，至十一時許禮成散會。</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電中國國民黨中央黨部，於今（十三）日上午十時三十分，在該部大禮堂舉行第一九二次總理紀念週。到中央執監委員暨各　部會工作同志，政府機關國民黨黨員，以及中央黨務工作人員，訓練團全體學員等六百餘人。由褚秘書長民誼主席，行禮如儀後，周委員化人報吿革命與感想，至十時餘禮成。</p>

<h3>波根維爾日軍向敵陣壓迫完全控制二三兩機塲</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電南太平洋日軍某基地電，波根維爾島日軍，自開始進攻，特羅基那後，即由數路向敵陣壓迫，十二日，日軍由敵第三機塲西北方之公路南下，繞過某十字路上之鐵絲網，突入敵陣，現正向南挺進中。又敵第三機塲東北方某高地及另一高地，自十一日以來，敵軍曾以有力部隊數度進襲，但均遭日軍擊退，受創慘軍，故該兩陣地乃由日軍確保中。且日軍更準備攻勢，因此，敵第二，第三兩機塲，巳全為日軍所壓制，故該兩機塲敵機之起飛着陸，均不可能，僅其第一機塲，似尙有數架敵機。</p>
<h3>渝軍俘虜口述滇遠征軍實情食糧不足戰力低下</h3>
<p>東京十三日中央社電據緬甸某基地電，蔣介石視察雲南遠征軍之際，曾宣稱於開始緬甸反攻作戰時，將兵士之月薪增加，以鼓舞逾軍將士之士氣。最近據被日軍俘虜之滇西挺進縱隊中校參謀稱雲南遠征軍將兵，不但未能反攻緬甸，一聞日軍進攻昆明，即戰戰兢兢，不知所措。據其謂遠征渝軍之寳情如次：遠征渝軍之食糧配給，雖較各地將兵稍佳，然其數量仍頗不足。故不惟作戰，即訓練時亦不足滿腹。復因蔬菜缺乏，及維他命之不足，　夜肓症者超百分之二十八以上。渝軍之戰力日形低下，而不知此種實况之蔣介石，徒向英美誇張遠征軍之威力，並特引導英美將領赴雲南第一綫視察，然而百聞不如一見，蔣鑑於自軍內情旣巳暴露，乃倉惶返渝。且命令遠征軍長官，使於開始反攻緬甸之際，再增加兵士之食糧，並實行臨時加餉。然緬甸之反攻作戰，僅為蔣介石之吶喊，遠征軍無論如何善戰，絕不能擊退强力之日軍。因緬甸公路已被切斷，敵方移動軍隊已不得使用汽車，實際在戰塲上必須使用汽車時，軍事委員會亦予以許可。然而屢向軍事當局要求，絕難許可，即得許可，復須　備汽油，且大半為破車，絕不堪用於作戰。去年常德一役之慘敗，實由於此。渝軍將兵及民間厭戰氣氛，亦愈趨　厚。因再三之敗戰，抗戰區一帶之住民已萎靡不振。尤以靑年</p>
<p>春江遺恨正在攝製中</p>
<p>南京十三日中央社電盟邦日本映盡會社與中華電影聯合公司，為謀中日文化交流，實現大東亞電影理想，業已决定合作拍製影片計劃。茲聞巳於二月上旬，開始拍製第一片，題名「春江遺恨」。該片以中日提携，擊滅英美為主題，以貫澈中日兩國同生共死，共存共熒之决意。該片正在攝製中，一俟完竣，即在各地放映。</p>
<h3>英美企圖實現「空中勝利」的夢</h3>
<p>英美對德國歐洲要塞的正面進攻，依然　躇，此際一味依賴盲炸戰術，結果對大都市不分皂白的轟炸最近英國國會中僧職議員倫克博士對英美空軍對德濫肆轟炸，發表非難的演說，中立國方面對於這種英國人自身非難政府的言論，異常注目。同時，反軸心空軍對法國各地盲目轟炸結果，法　人民死傷達數千人，北非法蘭西解放委員會方面的非難，也逐漸激昻，故對於英美空軍的怨聲，巳至可注目的地步。英國自治領大臣上議院代表克萊邦，對於倫克博士的演說，勉强辯解說，轟炸戰術最近實行强化，由愼重的選擇，轟炸變化為所謂無差別的平坦轟炸，英美空軍視無差別轟炸為正當云云。</p>
<p>邱吉爾的戰略</p>
<p>邱吉爾爾空軍攻　戰略，第一是向大西洋沿岸德國各潛水艦根據地，繼續實行大規模的盲目轟炸，從留倍克，洛斯托克，白利門，亞格斯蒲爾克等諸都市開始，自去年秋季以來，頓呈活躍。邱吉爾曾揚言，對德國的主要都市五十處，完全加以破壞。關於此層，瑞士某軍事專家　測，如欲轟炸德國工業中心，每日至少非一千架飛機不可，故必須常備飛機一萬架，每個月補充新機三千架。該專家的估　，姑置不論，總之反軸心方面所謂獲得「空中的勝利」，實際即是美國軍濫用大批空軍，但尙未有達到前述的水準模樣，惟自去年秋季以來，觀於其對漢堡，柏林等的大規模連積盲目　昨行為，可知反軸心方面空軍攻勢，日益熾烈，茲就本年一月十日起的一月間，統計敵方的攻勢，加以分析。</p>
<p>在此一個月內，英美空軍越英佛海峽而侵入大陸上空的日子，達二十日以上，其餘的十日間，因十氣候惡劣或拔術上的困難，不能出擊。在停止侵入大陸的期間，一面仍不斷到處實施轟炸。至於參加空襲大陸的機數及投彈的數量觀察，可分為三個等級：</p>
<p>最大的空襲，參加飛機在五百架以上，有時達千架以上。這種飛機編隊所投下的炸彈，普通總量在一千噸以上，有時達二千五百噸。</p>
<p>其次為出動數百架飛機，投下二百噸重的炸彈，第三是以軍事設施為目的的小編隊的轟炸，或以蚊子型輕轟炸機，進行偵察戰。這一個月間，　林這遇空襲入次（倘自一月十日起算則為十次），此十次中，六次都是一起出動數百架飛機的激烈空襲，敵方宣傳稱每次向柏林市投下炸彈一百噸至二千三百噸之多。對於這一點，德國宣傳部長部培爾曾稱：一柏林的防衛戰，現　達到歷史性的重要階段。務須打擊敵方屈服德國的企圖，並含有鍛鍊德國士氣的用意」。</p>
<p>柏林遭受盲炸</p>
<p>此一個月內，遭受猛烈空襲次於柏林的是弗朗克福，共經歷空襲三次，其中兩次投下一千八百噸，一次投下八百噸炸彈，布隆西華克，也受同等程度的損害，受到三次大規模空襲。</p>
<p>過去一月中，英美空軍的大小編隊，全部到達目的地的共三十六次，其中十五次對德國本土空襲，其他二十一次對「大西洋壁　」的法國北部，比利時荷蘭及德國西北部轟炸。這一帶是反軸心侵歐作戰的對象，刺探德方的防禦力量。其中五六次是投　一千噸以上的大規模轟炸，其他是對於軍事設施的轟炸。還有一點値得注意的，即是六次的大空襲中，三次集中於接近英國前哨　的加萊地區，包含加萊地區的法國北部海岸，在二十一次空襲中，受到十五次。</p>
<p>德國空防強化</p>
<p>觀於以上的統計，英美空軍對歐洲大陸的轟炸戰，是順從邱吉爾的意願，企圖破壞德國全部城市，摧殘德國人民士氣，以達侵略準備作戰的目的，巳昭然若揭，不過德國空軍現已有顯著的增强，其果敢的防　戰術，今後不許侵入的空軍跳　，依空軍轟炸成果如何而開　的第二戰綫，自然永遠難以實現了。（譯自二月二十八日朝日　開）</p>

<h3>渝共衝突最近益形尖銳共黨確定「一二七」政策</h3>
<p>中央社訊關於渝共內鬥糾紛，最近　突情形，已屢見各報。頃又據可靠方面獲得消息，中國共產黨為對付渝蔣政權，特確定所謂「一二七前進新政策」。其政策之內容以十分之一力量為對日之一主張，十分之二力量為保護渠本身之根據地，十分之七力量謀充擴大發展地域之企圖。刻渝方對共黨此項新政策，亦謀二項辦法對付，以取用政治手段交涉，及採取包圍攻勢。首由蔣介石長子蔣經國赴延安交涉二次，同時即下令包圍十八集團軍，八路軍及新四軍。此外並傳來消息云，渝軍已從華北向皖東壓迫新四軍，而新四軍方面為對付淪軍之包圍計劃起見，將第六師開駐廣德，　豐，新昌，三地，其第八師團開駐天馬山，而第七師團則向南陵開始移動云。</p>
<p>又關於渝方對付第八路軍之措置，現渝方派胡宗南，馬鴻達，傳作義，三軍包圍延安，其人數竟達十五萬人之多。共黨方面遭受壓迫者，有賀龍，劉伯誠，呂正操，聶榮臻；徐向前，蕭勁先，等各軍八萬餘人。去年十二月十四日一度發生衝突，雙方損害計共產軍蕭勁先部特務旅全滅，第一一五師死傷一團，呂正操，徐向前部亦有相當損害，，不下九千餘入，而渝軍損失一六七師軍兩團，七八師軍一團，二八師軍一營，死傷共達七千餘人。據聞目前馬鴻達部隊增加二師兵力，頃中檢林方面壓迫共軍，縮小包圍圈云。</p>
<p>多數印人懷疑英對印諾言</p>
<p>廣州十三日中央社電現英國以戰後許可印度獨立為條件，要求印度協力戰爭。二月二十六日渝大公報著論批評謂，英國擬以印度為基地，實行反攻，其迄未實現之最大原因，有二：　英艦隊不能向印度洋方面通航，　印度情勢在可成為反攻之基地，於實行作戰前不能好轉，反愈形惡劣。最近英方消息，傳英印雙方已有合作方策，然印度民衆之傾向如何，大多數印人無不懷疑英國許可印度戰後獨立之諾言。印國內情勢愈形惡劣，　堪憂盧，欲打開此難局，實非英人之力量所能及云。</p>

<h3>蘇聯在新疆勢力日形膨脹新省英蘇關係惡化</h3>
<p>中央社訊從西北所傳消息，謂去年蘇聯與新疆省主席盛世才所締結之新協定，最近蘇聯特根據此項條約，貸予盛世才大量巨款，其數目達數千萬盧布之鉅。並謂新疆方面將該款作為開發水力發電廠，及煤礦之用，一方由蘇派員在新採　大批羊皮棉花牛肉馬等，運蘇作為交換。　並派技術人員赴新，協力開發水力發電廠及煤礦，且復派農業專門人員，赴新之北部作改進農業工作之舉。並又傳目前新疆已常川駐有蘇聯軍事專門人員，彼輩　巳在新之軍官學校，充當敎授，同時訓練盛之軍隊，據聞現已成立蘇聯式之軍隊，達三師團之衆，瑜方於前年曾派朱紹良赴新，其目的亦為防止蘇聯在新膨脹勢力，向盛商　逾中央軍駐新問題。是時英違之方式。目前蘇聯勢力已伸展至新疆，尤其在新之英蘇關係，更為不良。新疆已宣佈對印度貿易停頓，蘇聯並唆使盛强迫印商人返國，故在新英蘇關係，亦日趨惡化云。</p>
<p>瑞典舉行防空演習</p>

<h3>德紀念陣亡將士竇尼資演說全國團結必能克敵制</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電德海軍總司令　尼資元帥於星期日德國無名英雄紀念日，在德國無錢　台廣播演辭稱：「德國在此次戰爭中，第五次向陸海空各戰綫之陣亡將士致敬禮，我人並紀念在恐怖空襲中被害之男女與兒童，我人以尊敬之態度向彼等之犧牲低首鞠躬，並以驕傲之哀呼，忍受彼等之　亡」。寶尼資元帥力言就，今日每一德人均知德國正從事於最嚴重之無情戰鬥中，此次戰爭中各種事件，以及敵人之野　目的，向德國人民顯示此次戰爭之一切危險。渠並稱此次之戰爭係敵人强迫德國接受者，「敵人輕舉妄　自命不凡，以假貌偽善之心，偽托保護波蘭民族之利益，而欲阻止德國弟兄之聯合」。寶尼資元帥鄭重宣稱，此次無情而不可避免之戰爭，乃為德國民族生死存亡所繫之戰爭，但德國人民深知在此重大之戰鬥中，幸賴上帝以絕無僅有之領袖人物付與德國民族，故必能經受磨練。在過去數年間，敵人以人力與物質之龐大力量，意圖向德國及德同盟之生活空間突擊，但到處均未到攻破一决定性之裂口。若非德元首於十年前重組德國之防軍，則今日德人之祖國，勢必不堪設想。惟獨德國之軍隊，能擊退敵人之猛攻，否則布爾希維克之洪流必已掃滅我人民與歐洲之文化矣」。寶尼資元帥力言「德國民族由於國內陣錢之堅决與剛强不屈，必將克服此次之戰鬥，德國民族　大之力量，在於內外陣綫指揮之統一，德國在此統一之指揮下，已成為無敵之國家，德國　此不屈不撓之態度，將獲得一　傚之國家所應享之和平。因此我人感謝陣亡英雄之最好方法，莫如對國家與元首誓矢忠順，而準備作最大之犠牲，直至勝利之到臨」。</p>
<p>美國務　卿或將訪蘇京</p>
<p>里斯本十三日中央社電據德國新聞社華盛頓息：美國務副卿斯蒂丁尼斯訪問倫敦之後，或將往訪莫斯科，斯氏不久即將自美京啓程赴倫敦，與英政府官員舉行會商。</p>
<h3>東綫南路蘇軍採鎌鎚戰術德避離行動進行順利</h3>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電海通社　綫南路德軍對巨哥夫上將大舉進攻之抵抗力逐漸增强。德軍有計劃之避離行動，進行甚為順利，前時德軍有被圍戚擊破之　，現此項危機業巳消弭。巨哥夫上將之戰術幷無新奇之處，蘇軍在戰綫各點大舉進攻，以圖包團廣大之區域，此類戰術蘇軍行之已久。蘇聯方面聲稱，蘇軍最近之戰事中首次採用「鎌鎚戰術」，德國方面加以　斥稱，蘇軍在東綫南路之「鎌形行動」與對戰綫上面之「鎚　行動」。皆未有决定性之成就，德軍撤退時，一部份軍隊巳撤抵布格河，蘇軍企圖在該河上游偷渡未成。戰塲東部之戰事發生於不毛之地，克里木亞戰錢之空軍活動，於週末重趨活躍。東綫中路目蘇軍停止進攻斯摩倫斯克至奧爾　間公路與維特勃斯克東南後，戰事已趨寧靜，尼維爾附近蘇軍已調到生力軍參戰，故激戰在進行中。戰綫北部如奧斯特洛夫，普羅斯考與那爾瓦區均有劇戰，惟不若南路　車之重要。</p>
<p>反軸心機盲炸義法城市</p>
<p>相林十三日中央社電反軸心機隊十一日轟炸義大利之巴杜亞及佛羅倫斯兩城平民住宅及文化紀念物受損甚重，十三世紀之奧曼坦尼敎堂，亦幾全部炸　。佛羅倫斯被炸三刻鐘之久，德軍為保存不可補償之藝術品起見，故不在佛市駐軍，但亦竟不免於英美機之侵襲。德義兩軍之戰鬥機，曾　惡劣天氣迎擊，擊落其二十一架。</p>
<p>柏林十三日中央社電據土倫來電：反軸心轟炸機隊十一日於戰鬥機掩護下空襲士倫港，並盲炸市街繁華區，除使郵局公會堂等多數樓房倒塌外，更有多數市民死傷。</p>
<p>美將對愛爾蘭施經濟壓力英禁英愛問旅有</p>
<p>日內瓦十三日中央社電德國新聞社訊：據交換電訊報發表華盛頓消息：美京外交界預料美將對愛施行不利之經濟措置</p>
<p>瑞典京城十三日中央社電英美兩國要求愛爾蘭政府封鎖軸心機關遭拒絕，結果英政府乃實行報復手段，而禁止英國與愛爾蘭間之旅行。據倫敦電稱：英內政部十二日宣絕不發給，英本國與愛爾蘭島之旅行許可證。又英政府此後將不再發給留英之愛籍工人之返愛證明書</p>
<h3>敎皇發出呼籲勿毀滅羅馬並對義難民深切同情</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡十三日中央社電敎　庇　十二世，昨對交戰雙方人士發出堅强語氣之呼　，請其不得以無情之空戰毀滅羅馬。羅馬之信徒，與南義之難民，聚集於聖彼得廣塲，恭聽敎皇之演說。其演詞有謂，轟炸聖城，無論以任何觀點觀之，均為不法，故請交戰雙方之負責奢竭力設法避免轟炸此孤立無援之城市，於其二十分鐘之演說中，敎皇對義難民表示深刻之同情，謂彼曾力阻戰事之　發，但終歸失敗後，彼即致力於減輕各國戰爭之苦痛。</p>
<p>太平洋戰局現勢德國及中立國方面的觀測</p>
<p>因美軍的登睦馬紹爾，襲擊特魯克，及日本在緬甸進攻的種種情勢，使東亞的軍事局面為之一新。日本內閣的一部分因之改組，而陸海軍統帥部亦見更迭。此種劃時期的事實，使德國一般人對日本更為關切。最近美國艦隊司令尼米資在會見新聞記者時稱：</p>
<p>一僅從海上攻略日本是不可能的。英美非從速運輸陸空軍赴中國，或在其沿岸登陸，以促進打倒日本不可一。</p>
<p>德意志報評論尼米資之言不啻自白其對日攻勢之困難。其論調如次：</p>
<p>一，美軍最近雖在所羅門，馬紹爾方面推進，但付了極高的代價。美軍更想向特魯克，　島，塞班，瑪利亞納等日本原來的防備外錢繼續駣島作戰，此在日本方面預料將有更激烈的反攻，而且縱使能够成功，但欲繼續侵攻日本的防衛內綫，亦非美國的龐天的軍需生產力所能負擔。</p>
<p>二，另一方面，蒙特巴頓的收復編甸戰役，雖可視為最切　者，但在目前，則因遭遇勇取的反攻，而不能不後退。</p>
<p>三。於是和在南中海沿岸試行登陸。此在目前的情勢下，希望成功，不啻痴人說夢。</p>
<p>英美對渝期待太大</p>
<p>四，尼米資的聲明，與美國軍事評論家漢遜，鮑爾溫在紐約泰晤士報上所論的，若合符節。鮑爾溫說：一英美常局對渝軍的期待太大了，道是大錯。英美軍應該自己用陸上部　在中國大陸登陸，以驅逐日，而使之屈服。這種　淺的見解，應斷予否定。又過分相信「空軍可以致勝」的話，亦是痴人說夢。</p>
<p>五，說到強化對日空製，這渝美空軍司令希諾特近來曾說：「要像今日襲擊總國這樣用空襲來襲擊日本，祗要派遺現在英美向歐洲的空軍的十分之一就夠了。」他辯稱駐渝空軍在數量上過於劣弱，並稱：「駐渝空軍要獲得必要的補充，必須以華南沿岸到揚子江，及向華北的鐵道恢復到反軸心手中為前提條件。」</p>
<p>這完全說明了駐渝美空軍作戰的困難性。</p>
<p>六，總之，美軍將攻擊特魯克島予以過大的評價，而宣傳對日大攻勢的迫近，無非資為對內的　斯福四度當選運動的一助而已。</p>
<p>更有一部德國人的觀點，以為現在美國的對日攻勢，不過是反軸心軍開始對歐大攻擊前企圖伸展其對日攻勢的據點而已，祗是一時的性質。反之，亦有人觀測英美鑒於歐洲對蘇關係的徵妙，乃欲暫以其主力傾注於遙遠的太平洋方面。</p>
<p>英美被迫兩面作戰</p>
<p>總之，英美分散其力量於歐洲太平洋，被迫二面作戰，這是無疑的。而美國對日攻勢的成果，前述　意志報的論說，可代表德國有識者之見解。關於此次日本的軍政軍令密切化的措　，英美方面任意臆測，而德國方面則以為這本來是日本的懸案，而且在這决戰階段，軍事行動上須要即决即行，軍事行動與最高政第須要一體化，此均在這次的措置中達到解决了。由此，日本整個的軍事行動，更可有合理的運用，而寄予極大的期待，（翔：譯自三月一日東京讀賣報知）</p>
<p>關於日趨激烈的南太平洋戰况，據瑞士的沮利希日報刋載題為一反戰心軍的對日攻勢」的論文，檢討一九四二年夏以夾開始的反軸心軍反攻作戰，從中立國的塲立，解釋反軸心軍進攻的意義，並預測今後反軸心軍的作戰目標如次；</p>
<p>「反軸心軍對日軍諸基地的攻擊戰法，先以航空母艦及基地航空部隊大舉進發，在其制空權之下，接近日軍基地，用艦砲射　，在其掩護下地上部隊實行登陸。如其能够登陸，再以之化為海空基地，用同樣的戰法進行另一次作戰，這就是所謂一跳島作戰」。在反軸心軍的這戰略中。　堪注目者，反軸心軍雖出動艦隊接近日軍防　中心地，亦未受日本　隊的有效抵抗，似於日本不利。當然，日本艦隊還　在着，其戰艦有極大的戰門力，且日木海軍使用此艦隊時，取極愼重的熊度。祇要想到現在英美之數的優勢，日本海軍鹽於目前的戰局，當然出以此種態度。</p>
<p>英美海軍現狀</p>
<p>然則英美海軍的現有勢力如何呢？正確的數宇不明，前此所傳者則如次：</p>
<p>一，超過六萬順的蒙達那級戰艦五艘，從一九四一年起開始建造，預計業已就役。</p>
<p>一，五萬噸以上的愛渥　級戰艦五艘，從一九四〇年至四一年起開始建造，現在已見之於參加太平洋作戰中。</p>
<p>一，四萬噸以上的華盛）頓級戰艦六艘，過去三年來已經就役。</p>
<p>一，此外尙有戰艦數　似在建造中。</p>
<p>一，空母除前此所喪失者外尙有十餘艘。</p>
<p>一·護送用小型空母達七十餘艘。</p>
<p>一，英國至少有數艘戰艦可用於太平洋上的對日戰中，此從法。義的投降艦隊及德國艦隊的現有勢力　來是可能的。</p>
<p>日本艦隊嚴陣以待</p>
<p>反軸心軍因其海空軍在數量上佔得優勢，乃能取大規模的作戰行動，而對日軍諸基地漸有不利的影響。反軸心軍現在最顯著的作戰目標是拉巴爾與特魯克。對於巴爾之戰，反軸心軍一面轟炸港灣本身，一面轟炸補充彈藥糧食的船舶。這作戰不能不從遠離日軍陣地的基地開始。這說明了直接攻擊佈有堅固的海空軍基地之困難。且反動心軍此等作戰的目標，乃欲獲得美空軍的進攻基地，以便對日空製。要之，單受部分的打擊，日本决不會混亂，目前正在强化最善的防禦態勢。在部分的作戰中，出動艦隊顯將極為愼重。最近東條大將及島田大將的就任參謀總長及軍令部總長。說明日本决心用最大的努力欲擊破反難心的攻勢，確立了新的反攻作戰的新方針，來應付以物量為最大武器的反軸心軍攻勢作戰。（翔：譯自三月一日東京讀賣報知）</p>

<h3>白蓮涇中國酒精廠獻納日本海軍昨在海軍武官官邸行獻納式</h3>
<p>中央社訊盟邦日本，正以舉國力量，遂行大東亞戰爭，為東亞民族爭取解放，而我國民衆在物質上精神上予以一切協助，以求此偉大目的之貫澈。茲悉，本市大企業家建　有限公司董事長董江泉，以前聞日本海軍方面現正物色酒精工廠一處，該氏乃於九日國府參戰紀念日，向海軍武官府說明願將浦東白蓮涇之中國酒精廠工塲，全部　納日本海軍，日海軍當局於接受董氏美意之下，深為感激，於昨晚在海軍武官官邸舉行獻納儀式，出席者計到建源公司董事長董江泉，該公司經理譚殷康，暨其他關係方面代表，日方由近　海軍少將致謝詞·按該工廠最初以資本金一百五十萬元着手經營，為最新式之酒精工廠，旋以中日事變一度停工，後復受日軍管理，委託大橋龜次郎經營，前年十月解除軍管理，交還我方，改稱大陸酒精廠。</p>

<h3>松島報道部長駁斥英美虛偽宣傳企圖瑋飾反攻作戰敗績</h3>
<p>中央社訊日駐華艦　報道部長松島大佐，昨（十三）日會見記者　時，對敵方英美，因先後在太平洋反攻作戰，　甸作戰，迭遭敗北，極感焦慮，最近乃大事虛偽宣傳，企圖諱飾事，予以痛詆。</p>
<p>英美作戰毫無目標</p>
<p>松島部長略謂：此次戰爭，我帝國稱為大東亞戰爭，是有建設性的大目標，反之敵方英美，毫無中心目標，唯企圖遂其征覇世界之野心，綜合最近一星期間敵方宜傳，反映出美國在中部太平洋作戰之失敗，以及英國之細甸作戰受挫，其戰略　的　傳不如過去之大吹大　，而在政略上的宣傳，却日員賣力。其目標在或嚇弱小中立國，蓋彼等在戰略上的宣傳，美國曾於六日對此次英　細甸作戰　表明不滿意，而英方印度總督致電鼓勵蒙特巴頓，以為對於美國的重大諷刺，介乎英美之間的渝方，使其左右為難，在七日率直自認緬甸作戰之困難。</p>
<p>敵方宣傳紛歧不一</p>
<p>繼於八日英方發表稱：轟炸日本確屬可能　英海長亞歷山大於下院曾力主加强對日作戰　並下斷語　。英國海軍之數成，可分　於太平洋上云　九日又傳出美國顱斯　與尼米茲在華盛頓會談，以上搜　宣傳唯有　露英美渝各自推諉責任，　無新的意義　至於彼等政略上的宣傳，則不勝枚　。例如六日英美兩國因阿富汗石油問題，意見形成水火，七日英國撤回駐土耳其派遺軍使節，停止供土軍火，八日英國亦向土耳其採取政略上的進攻，但英國艾登在議會席上，避免言及土耳其問題，尤有一點更値重視，即英國左翼派對於中國共產黨極表關心。七日之英國共產黨機關報「星期日報」，為中共大事宣傳。又關於蘇芬問題，迄今芬蘭對蘇聯之和議，一無答覆，如以上所述，敵方宣傳紛歧不一致，但各種宣傳不外乎英美因對於日德之正攻法迭遭失敗，乃不異　　手段，作空洞的宜傳。</p>
<p>欺騙手段諱飾敗績</p>
<p>最後更有有得重朋者，　英　對於淪方的策路，聞三男上旬在渝英美使節，會要求　介石准許英美除空軍以外之地上部隊，亦進駐中國大陸，但卒為渝方反對。又如美國會稱：對中國人或印度人予以入國　云云，此點更不値　者一晒，蓋在戰時中國人印度人尙能步達洋渡美乎？將來戰事和平，中國人赴美者增加，則　以閉門羹，同意料中事。美國不但欺騙中國人，凡亞州人稍一不愼，即將入其設中。英美受此次太平洋機動作戰，及細甸反攻作戰之大挫折，專門依賴欺騙的宣傳戰，企圖諱飾其敗績，但事　昭彰，豈能掩盡世人耳目乎？</p>
<h3>經濟界言評淸毒以後</h3>
<p>今日經濟界之毒棄，為　於國家，有甚於鴉片毒素之儒審於人體，以是經濟界的淸毒還動，　視任何其他一切淸毒運動為更重耍，更急切，自不待智者而後知了。經濟界濟毒運動，在去年收贊　紗布的時候，曾經發動並且推行過一次，祇是行之未能澈底致貽「捉了小魚，放了大魚」之　，而當時所收之效，亦徒覺渺乎其小；自茲以往，國積投機者流，益覺國家法令之不足畏，遂乃變本加厲，肆無忌憚，終至囤積投機行為，變成官督商辦，而物價問題，遂乃嚴重達於極點了。</p>
<p>物價問題的核心，在於發揮政治力量；政府公佈的懲治囤積條例，確較過去為嚴厲而具體，但欲其發生抑平物價之效，則視執行的手段與步　為如何；這是我們輿諭界兩年來　致的主張，正不必重申其說了。今次國府斷然澄淸吏治，不惜以政府大員，提交特別法庭從嚴鞠審　依法懲洽　同時，當局除嚴令商人不得經營非法交易外，並　禁公務人員兼營傷業，倘敢囤積主要商品，製成品或原料者，一經查獲屬實，即依法庭以無期徒刑或十五年以上有期徒刑。這樣一個事實與這樣一個法令，不能不說是澄淸吏洽前途的有力措施，切望政府當局，本此决心，勵精圖洽，持之以恒，庶幾淸毒以後的中國經濟界，從此有復蘇之望。</p>

<h3>國民論壇論華股市塲的雜護</h3>
<p>念麟</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭發生以後，以上海而論，隨　統制設施的加强，公開囤貨與標金外匯紗布等投機活動　都受到嚴厲的阻　。於　羣　目光　移到華股交易。自從證券交易所復　專拍　股以後，　股有了正式市塲和公開市價，除掉平時從事貨物標金外匯紗布等買賣的人物轉移目光於華股外，一般　水階級，參加買　華股者，一大多似一大，因其手續簡便獲利較易，所以股票交易，可說普及於上海各階層的市以。此種市民，大部份並非有多少餘力來投資，實際是受了高物價的生活逼迫，才典質變賣或合夥經營，以期獲利於萬一的。但自上年下半年產業證券發生惡性膨脹現象以後，此輩薪水階級就大受影響。</p>
<p>就金融機關而言，近年來投資於產　證券的，其總數　無正式統計，但就　般情形觀察，為數常不在少。　自產　證券有了公開市塲以後。質押放款以華股作質品的，更所在都是。尤其自厲行統制經濟以後，　般人因恐商品受統制收買，而股票可自由流　，於是行莊所收入的質品，一般的都是以股票為大宗。今春股票慘跌，致借戶無力價還借款而影　行莊的頭寸，致拆息之高，駭人聽問　金融機　　了調劑頭寸，不得不忍痛出售股票，只求頭寸到手，不惜剜肉補瘡，囚此股票價格，愈賣愈低，拆息黑市，愈來愈高，根基充實的銀行，尙可支持下去，力量較弱的行莊，或已破綻百出，這　是社會經濟之福？且即使頭寸寬裕的行莊，以後亦將視投資證券為畏途、而將資命移　去直接國貨，於是股票更跌，貨價更高，社會愈加不安，民生亦愈不寗。</p>
<p>目下上海股市不振，其影響極大，已如上述。如果負責富局還不力謀救濟，則民十信交風潮的重浪，或不無可能。影　所及，不但把過去數年官商維　華股市塲的苦心，前一功　棄，且今後欲再建一產業證券市塲，恐亦難獲得一般社會的信仰了。</p>
<p>吾人現在所期望於主管官署及官立領袖銀行者，為對於證券市塲，除積極方面作事先少監督外，並　在消極方面，作事後之補救。因為維護證券市　，　是保障投資者的利益，保障投資者的利益　也　是鼓勵民衆投資證券的興趣，增裕產業資本的來源。在此華股　格下降聲中，主管機關似應督促官立領袖銀行，詳細審核上市股票各公司的資產　際價値，如凈資產超過其所發股票的市價總値，則官立銀行似應放出通貨收買股票。這樣一方面證劵市價得以維持，市面銀根自然鬆動，拆息亦可減低，同時還可增强政府管制工業的力量。如將來股票市價作不合理之高漲時，官辦領袖銀行即可出售其股票，俾資收縮通貨。</p>
<p>以上所陳，是屬於消極的補救辦法。我們更企望主管官署，能防患於未然，也就是加嚴事前的監督。主管機關對於卜市的華股，不論發行者是新成立的公司或原有的老公司；對於其營運情形及資產負債狀況，應有詳細的經當的淸查，公開宣告，以保障投資者的利益。對於新成立的公司。應認　騐資並審核賬目。為懲前　後計，此後新設公司時。應將資金先行掃數解交官立銀行，由官立銀行出具證明書後，方可准其開創立會及設立登記。如此，庶狡黠者不能串通不健全之金融機關，以偸天換日的手段虛設內容不充實的公司，來貽害社會。其次，地方經濟行政當局，應厲行企業機關的經常監督，平時審查各企業機關經營的　務是否與其章程所規定者相符　是否從事　務範圍以外的活動，而影響投資者資金的安全　如發現企業機關的主持人有犯法　違章情事，應據實檢舉，依法處罰，使企業界的害羣之馬無法立　，以雜護投資者的利益·</p>
<p>再次　交易所當局，應認淸證券市塲負責引導社會資金流注於生產事　的職能，凡非生產事　及已停工的工廠，其發行的股票，似不應允許其流通。還有當股票價落上　過甚的時候，應　查其上漲的原因，是否有人在暗中操縱，以企求非法利得。又當股票價格突然下降　，亦應澈查是否有人乘機拋空，藉圖漁利。須知交易所雖屬一營業機關，但對於投資者亦應員　障的責任。所以當市　　發現有非法役機的行為時，交易所當局，便首應秉公　查，以免代人受過，同時審核登場的　股時，寧　取嚴格態度，切勿失之過濫，不但須着重書面的報吿，尤應注重於實　的調查，這種調查工作，或由交易所派員，或委托　信所代理，俾明悉其資產是否充實，經營是否合法，以為允許其股票登塲與否的標準。</p>
<p>最後，吾二人　望中央主管官署俗令發行股票各公司，每年公佈其資產負債表。損益計算書，並令由地方主管機　就近加以審核調查，庶一般投資者　　　各公司的財務情形　甄　投資對　時，不致受　目引誘的損失。</p>
<p>合組借款銀團借款銀　　中國等十九家銀行組　　之　名為「採購米糧借款銀　一，以中國銀行為代表行辦理銀團一應事務借款方式，以米統會陸續閒具之承兌匯票，憑貼現人即採辦商，向銀團貼現支付之。其貼現總額，連續循環以國幣七萬萬元為度，分為二百單位，每一單位計三百五十萬元，各團員銀行認借單位，計中國·交通·華興·各五十單位，浙興·上海·金城·大陸·中　墾業·以及四行儲蓄會各四單位：浙實·鹽業·甲孚·新華·中南·國華·各三單位，中匯·調業·中國企業·中國工業·各二單位，惟貼現人以承兌匯票向銀團貼現時，另訂貼現契約，由米統會證明之，貼現和率為年息八運，於貼現日預扣之。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪　羊譯</p>
<p>十月下旬又到橙費橋綠的時候了，眞人的氣力也完全復原了。在原村曰的陸戰演習，也精神飽滿地回到學生館來。回來了以後，為出出角力大會，開始猛烈地訓練。</p>
<p>在那天接到廟行鎭，和大塲鎭陷落的報吿，學生們的面都現着得意的顏色　。</p>
<p>「谷－說是你那兒來了一封快信·到敎官室夫取吧」。</p>
<p>從伍長補口裏，聽到這句話的時侯，眞人忽然想起隆夫的事情來了。也許　夫能來到吳市，而寄信給自己的。心裏不住砰砰地跳着</p>
<p>然而預想是完全相反的。是從四吉哥那裏來的快信。信上草寫着接到從原隊來的通吿，據說眞一郎兄在十月四日已經戰死了。</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>一位好哥哥，雖是次男，在家庭中，却具有長男的威望。在弟兄中風采雖最不美觀，而是一個最快活最健壯的人，並且好管事，作過下荒田研明舍（健兒舍）的幹事，在二中時代當過應援國長——的確是　　健兒氣質的哥哥。而且特別愛護眞人的。母親同哥哥，都倚重他的。</p>
<p>（母親的心中，要怎樣地！）</p>
<p>眞人那帶淚的眼，又將快信看了一遍。回一郎兄戰死的地方，是上海郊外的羅店鎭。在怎樣的一個地方，作過怎樣的戰，眞人是不得而知的，但是可以推想這位哥哥，一定會作出驚人的戰鬥，而死法也一定會是高尙的。那黑臉大眼睛的眞一郎兄，那低低的鐵帽子下的頭部，　着鎗桿，殺進敵陣的情形，剎那間在眞人的腦海中反映出來了。</p>
<p>眞人雖落下了珠淚，同時惑到一種凜然地強烈的衝動。</p>
<p>（我也不能服輸的！）</p>
<p>從父親死後，在小學時代已經時常在心中吶喊的呼　，是那時所不可比擬的熱烈而激越的吶喊，震動着自己的耳鼓。</p>
<p>在江田島一年半來的生活，使他這樣吶喊着的。在不知不覺之問，而生成了的軍人意識，使他如此的。因為眞人不由不想到眞一郎兄是一個上等兵。一個台灣高雄地方的稅關吏。雖然哥哥也一定是一個忠　的軍人，但並不是以軍人為生的。反之，眞人自己雖是一個學生的身分，而是一生獻給國家軍隊的。同哥哥的立塲，是不同的。然而哥哥先戰死了。在谷的家庭，若出戰死者的時候，頭一個，便應當是自己的——</p>
<p>這並不是因為哥哥先得到名譽的戰死的一種小功名心。乃是眞人已經根據軍人心理而思考一切的明證。</p>
<p>他使動地咬着下嘴唇。他以為對不住哥哥，愧對哥哥，對哥哥感到無限地愛與悲哀——在他的胸中，這樣複雜地波浪在動　着。</p>
<p>總而言之，眞一郎的戰死，恰與眞人一個重大地影響。對於國家，家庭，和自己的觀念，好像因此而完全都表現於面前來了似的。外人雖不。得而知，自此以後，眞人的言行，却大有變更了。</p>

        <h1>1944.03.14</h1>
<h3>On the Dismissal of Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen</h3>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported the National Government's order: "It has been found that Hou Dazhuang, Director of the Jiangsu Grain Bureau (Hou concurrently serves as the Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters), and Hu Zheng, Director of the Grain Ministry's Aquatic Products Administration and concurrently Director of the Construction Ministry's Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, engaged in significant malfeasance in the procurement of military grain during the wartime period. They are hereby dismissed from their positions and handed over to a special court for strict investigation and punishment according to the law." Furthermore: "It has been found that Gu Baoheng, Minister of the Grain Ministry, and Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister, are suspected of involvement in the Hou Dazhuang and Hu Zheng corruption case. They are hereby dismissed from their positions and handed over to a special court for impartial trial." Standing from the perspective of the people, upon reading these two orders, we immediately felt a sense of relief. At the same time, we believe that these two orders are the first wise measures taken by the National Government since returning to the capital, and the first sound of the recent political reforms and establishment of credibility by the National Government. This newspaper believes that there must be right and wrong, rewards and punishments, in order for politics to get on the right track. This is a very important turning point, and we hope that the government authorities will pay attention to it and seize it.</p>
<p>Analyzing the orders further, the former involves "corruption" leading to "dismissal" and "strict investigation," while the latter involves "suspicion" leading to "dismissal" and "impartial trial." There is clearly a distinction in severity. However, we are ashamed to say that we heard from the sidelines that the Hou and Hu case was reported by the Allied Suzhou Military Police. We believe that Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen are the highest officials in charge of grain, and Hou Dazhuang and Hu Zheng have a close kinship relationship and are also Gu and Zhou's confidants and direct subordinates. Wouldn't the superiors be aware of the significant corruption committed by their trusted subordinates? Therefore, Hou and Hu's audacity was preceded by Gu and Zhou's protection. Undoubtedly, Gu, Zhou, Hou, and Hu are birds of a feather. Hou and Hu are the implementers of corruption, while Gu and Zhou are the behind-the-scenes supporters. In short, the four are one, colluding in corruption. Even if we take a step back, if subordinates have significant corruption and the superiors fail to detect and report it, the responsibility of condoning and neglecting is serious enough and cannot be shirked. Therefore, today we specifically use "On the Dismissal of Gu Baoheng and Zhou Naiwen" as the title, to emphasize the guilt that Gu and Zhou should bear, which is definitely not "suspicion" but is, in essence, more serious than the guilt of Hou and Hu. This is our opinion provided to the officials presiding over the special court.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Geng Jiaji, an important official of the municipal government in this city, committed suicide, which was rumored to be related to the Hou case. It was heard that Mr. Geng was deceived into corruption by those around him. As a result, the case was exposed, and he deeply understood the gravity of his responsibility and was unable to find a way out, eventually ending his life. Now, leaving aside Hou and Hu for the moment, let us ask Gu and Zhou to search their own hearts and ask themselves how they will handle this.</p>
<p>Regarding the Hou and Hu case, we have the following thoughts:</p>
<p>The Allied military police authorities, in this case, were able to report it impartially, without avoiding suspicion or resentment, and without considering the high rank of the officials involved. Our gratitude lies not only in the fact that this has made corrupt officials tremble, but also in promoting the beginning of the purification of officialdom in China. This is the most concrete and effective measure taken by the Allies to strengthen the National Government.</p>
<p>The integrity of personnel is still the core of political reform, especially in handling grain administration. Moral integrity, self-discipline, and public service should be the code of conduct for public officials. Superiors must especially examine their subordinates, and when corruption is discovered, they should not be swayed by personal feelings and should promptly report it. Moreover, people like Director Gu, whether from a political experience, reputation, or qualifications perspective, are not sufficient to take on important central tasks, especially the major grain administration matters that are related to people's livelihoods. This is a shortcoming of the government's imprudent use of personnel. Therefore, we hope that the government will take the strict investigation of the Hou case as a starting point, eradicate corruption, the supervisory authorities will exercise their impeachment duties, and the judicial authorities will exert their prosecutorial mission, assisting each other horizontally and vertically, and jointly advancing rapidly on the open road of purifying officialdom and reforming politics.</p>
<p>The military grain involved in the Hou and Hu corruption case is certainly important. However, the importance of institutions responsible for managing civilian food, such as the Rice and Grain Control Committee, is no less important. And rice and grain control affairs are most likely to cause those with unstable morals to engage in corruption. In the past, there have also been corruption facts among the staff of the Rice Control Committee, but we have yet to hear of thorough investigation and severe punishment, which is most regrettable. At the same time, whether it is military grain or civilian food, they are both major matters related to life. Those who handle "grain administration" must have a deep sense of caution and work diligently. We urge the authorities and personnel of the Grain Control Committee to take the Hou, Hu, Gu, and Zhou case as a profound lesson, work diligently and selflessly, and not be tempted by petty gains, lest they ruin their future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Deploying Defensive Offensive in Creek Valley Area, Enemy Supply Routes Completely Severed</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front reports that Japanese troops are concentrating forces in the area of the Kin-kyu Ridge, holding firm positions in front of Fort White and in the mountainous area upstream of the Isalo River, attempting to resist. Furthermore, enemy troops have constructed circular fortifications on mountain peaks ranging from 5,000 to 8,000 feet in elevation, deploying various artillery pieces in front. These fortifications are all connected by supply roads to the rear. The terrain is steep and dangerous, completely severing lateral communication, so each mountain peak is in an isolated state. The elite Japanese troops are best at surprise attacks in dense forests, causing the enemy great intimidation. Now, the British-Indian troops are undergoing fierce attacks from the Japanese forces in the air and on the ground and will soon be wiped out.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 13th (Central News Agency) - A general overview of the Kin-kyu area on the Indian border: Currently, Japanese troops are fighting in the Kin-kyu Ridge area on the Indian border (the word "Kin" in Burmese means "uncivilized"). This area is a range of towering mountains, a mysterious place where culture is blocked. This area is located in the middle of the Arakan Mountains, the center of the Indian-Burmese border, and is truly a natural military stronghold. Peaks of 4,000 to 5,000 feet high rise and fall continuously, interspersed with creek valleys, and sometimes vast dense forests cover the mountains. Before the Greater East Asia War, this area was not valued because the terrain was dangerous and transportation was inconvenient, and there were few travelers. After the British-Indian troops retreated in the Burmese campaign, they built fortifications along the Indian-Burmese border, and thus the Kin-kyu Ridge area, a secret place in Asia, began to be known to the world. The climate in this area varies greatly. The dry season is from November to April of the following year. Autumn, winter, and spring pass in an instant, and the rest is a long summer. Winter is the coldest, with snow often seen everywhere. During the day, the heat rises to 130 to 140 degrees, and at night it drops to 0 degrees. The climate is extremely peculiar, so malaria, cholera, and plague are common. The Kin people living in this area number about 360,000, mostly along the Manipur River. They are short in stature and fierce in nature. Recently, Britain attempted to obtain the abundant forest resources of this area, trying to use Christianity to assimilate the Kin people, but only provoked resentment from the Kin people. Before the Greater East Asia War, Major Vasba, an Englishman who was a leader of the Kin people, suddenly disappeared when the war broke out, his life and death unknown, probably killed by Kin people eager for revenge. Moreover, a highway has been opened in this area, which is the crystallization of the Kin people's sacrificed sweat. The Kin people have a deep hatred for the inhumane British. This ethnic group in a secret place will also be liberated by the Japanese army from the shackles of the British.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Central Party Affairs Personnel Training Committee meeting, attended by all committee members, was chaired by Chairman Chen Chunpu. The committee passed multiple motions, including topics for small group discussions, themes for group discussions, and the theme for the plenary discussion.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Bougainville Pressuring Enemy Positions, Completely Controlling Second and Third Airfields</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a Japanese base in the South Pacific reports that Japanese troops on Bougainville Island, after beginning their offensive on Torokina, are pressing toward enemy positions along several routes. On the 12th, Japanese troops moved south on the highway northwest of the enemy's Third Airfield, bypassing the barbed wire on a certain intersection, and breaking into enemy positions. They are now advancing south. Furthermore, the enemy launched several attacks with strong forces on a certain high ground northeast of the enemy's Third Airfield and another high ground since the 11th, but were all repelled by Japanese troops, suffering heavy casualties. Therefore, both positions are being secured by Japanese troops. Moreover, Japanese troops are preparing for an offensive. As a result, the enemy's Second and Third Airfields have been completely suppressed by Japanese troops, so it is impossible for enemy aircraft to take off or land at those two airfields. Only their First Airfield seems to still have a few enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Army Prisoner Recounts Truth About Yunnan Expeditionary Force: Insufficient Food, Low Combat Power</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain base in Burma reports that when Chiang Kai-shek inspected the Yunnan Expeditionary Force, he declared that he would increase the monthly salaries of soldiers when the counter-offensive operation in Burma began, in order to boost the morale of the soldiers of the Yu army. Recently, according to a lieutenant colonel staff officer of the Yunnan Western Advance Column who was captured by the Japanese army, not only was the Yunnan Expeditionary Force unable to launch a counter-offensive in Burma, but they were trembling with fear and at a loss when they heard that the Japanese army was attacking Kunming. According to him, the situation of the expeditionary Yu army is as follows: Although the food ration for the expeditionary Yu army is slightly better than that of soldiers in other areas, the quantity is still quite insufficient. Therefore, they are not only unsatisfied during combat, but also during training. Furthermore, due to the lack of vegetables and vitamins, more than 28 percent suffer from night blindness. The combat power of the Yu army is declining daily, but Chiang Kai-shek, unaware of this situation, is merely exaggerating the power of the expeditionary force to the United States and Britain, and specially guiding British and American generals to inspect the front lines in Yunnan. However, seeing is believing. Chiang, seeing that the internal situation of his army has already been exposed, hurriedly returned to Chongqing. He also ordered the commanders of the expeditionary force to further increase the soldiers' food rations and implement temporary pay increases when the counter-offensive in Burma begins. However, the counter-offensive in Burma is merely Chiang Kai-shek's cry. No matter how well the expeditionary force fights, it will never be able to defeat the powerful Japanese army. Because the Burma Road has been cut off, the enemy cannot use automobiles to move troops. In fact, when it is necessary to use automobiles on the battlefield, the Military Commission also permits it. However, it is extremely difficult to obtain permission even after repeatedly requesting the military authorities, and even if permission is obtained, gasoline must be prepared, and most of the vehicles are broken and cannot be used for combat. The disastrous defeat in the Battle of Changde last year was due to this. The war-weariness of the Yu army soldiers and the people is also increasing. Due to repeated defeats, the residents in the anti-Japanese areas have become depressed. Especially the youth.</p>
<p>"Eternal Regret of the Spring River" Is Being Filmed</p>
<p>Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Allied Japanese Film Company and the China Film United Company have decided to cooperate in producing films to promote cultural exchange between China and Japan and realize the ideals of East Asian cinema. It has been heard that the first film, titled "Eternal Regret of the Spring River," began filming in early February. The theme of the film is Sino-Japanese cooperation to destroy the United States and Britain, to thoroughly implement the determination of China and Japan to live and die together and coexist and prosper together. The film is currently being filmed and will be shown in various places as soon as it is completed.</p>
<h3>The United States and Britain Attempt to Realize the Dream of "Air Victory"</h3>
<p>The United States and Britain are still hesitating to launch a frontal offensive against Germany's European fortress. At this moment, they are blindly relying on blind bombing tactics. As a result, indiscriminate bombing of major cities has occurred. Recently, Dr. Lenk, a clergyman member of the British Parliament, delivered a speech criticizing the British and American air forces for indiscriminate bombing of Germany. Neutral countries are paying close attention to this kind of speech in which the British themselves criticize their own government. At the same time, as a result of the counter-axis air force's indiscriminate bombing of various parts of France, thousands of French people have been killed or injured. The criticism from the North African French Committee of Liberation is also gradually intensifying. Therefore, the complaints about the British and American air forces have reached a noticeable level. Lord Cranborne, the representative of the British Dominions in the House of Lords, reluctantly defended Dr. Lenk's speech, saying that bombing tactics have recently been strengthened, changing from careful selection of targets to so-called indiscriminate blanket bombing. The British and American air forces regard indiscriminate bombing as legitimate.</p>
<p>Churchill's Strategy</p>
<p>Churchill's air offensive strategy is first to continue to carry out large-scale indiscriminate bombing of German submarine bases along the Atlantic coast, starting with cities such as Lübeck, Rostock, Bremen, and Augsburg, which has become active since the autumn of last year. Churchill once declared that he would completely destroy 50 major cities in Germany. Regarding this, a certain Swiss military expert estimated that at least 1,000 aircraft per day would be needed to bomb Germany's industrial centers, so it would be necessary to have 10,000 aircraft on standby and replenish 3,000 new aircraft each month. Regardless of this expert's estimate, in short, the counter-axis side's so-called obtaining "air victory" is actually the United States' abuse of a large number of air forces, but it has not yet reached the aforementioned level. However, judging from its large-scale continuous indiscriminate bombing of Hamburg, Berlin, etc. since the autumn of last year, it can be seen that the counter-axis side's air offensive is becoming increasingly fierce. Let us analyze the enemy's offensive during the month from January 10th of this year.</p>
<p>In this one month, the British and American air forces crossed the English Channel and intruded into the airspace of the continent for more than 20 days. During the remaining 10 days, they could not sortie due to bad weather or technical difficulties. During the period of suspension of intrusions into the continent, they still continued to carry out bombing everywhere. As for the number of aircraft participating in the air raids on the continent and the quantity of bombs dropped, it can be divided into three levels:</p>
<p>The largest air raids involved more than 500 aircraft, sometimes reaching more than 1,000. The total amount of bombs dropped by such aircraft formations is usually more than 1,000 tons, sometimes reaching 2,500 tons.</p>
<p>The second is sorties involving hundreds of aircraft, dropping 200 tons of bombs. The third is small-formation bombing aimed at military facilities, or reconnaissance warfare conducted by Mosquito light bombers. In this one month, Berlin was attacked the most times (ten times if counted from January 10th). Among these ten times, six were fierce air raids with hundreds of aircraft sortied together. The enemy propaganda claimed that each time they dropped 100 to 2,300 tons of bombs on the city of Berlin. Regarding this point, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said: "The defensive battle of Berlin has now reached a historically important stage. We must strike down the enemy's attempt to subjugate Germany and include the intention of forging the German people's morale."</p>
<p>Berlin Suffers Blind Bombing</p>
<p>In this one month, the city that suffered the most intense air raids after Berlin was Frankfurt, which experienced air raids three times. Among them, 1,800 tons were dropped twice and 800 tons were dropped once. Brunswick also suffered the same degree of damage, suffering three large-scale air raids.</p>
<p>In the past month, the British and American air forces' large and small formations reached their destinations a total of 36 times. Among them, 15 air raids were on the German mainland, and the other 21 were bombing of the "Atlantic Wall" in northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and northwestern Germany. This area is the target of the counter-axis invasion of Europe, probing the German defense forces. Among them, five or six were large-scale bombings dropping more than 1,000 tons, and the others were bombing of military facilities. Another point worth noting is that among the six large air raids, three were concentrated in the Calais area, which is close to the British outposts. The northern coast of France, including the Calais area, was attacked 15 times out of 21 air raids.</p>
<p>German Air Defenses Strengthened</p>
<p>Judging from the above statistics, it is clear that the British and American air force's bombing campaign against the European continent is following Churchill's wishes, attempting to destroy all German cities, devastate the morale of the German people, and achieve the purpose of preparing for the invasion. However, the German air force now has a significant increase, and its courageous defense tactics will not allow the invading air force to jump over it. The second front, which is to be opened depending on the results of the air force's bombing, will naturally never be realized. (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, February 28)</p>

The training period for the eighth term of the cadre team is only three months. We hope that all students will receive rigorous training. Both educators and those being educated must invigorate their spirits and strive to achieve maximum results."</p>
<h3>Conflicts Between Chongqing and the Communists Have Recently Become Increasingly Acute; the Communist Party Has Determined the "1-2-7" Policy</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report - Reports about the internal strife and disputes between Chongqing and the Communists have been frequently seen in newspapers recently. Now, according to reliable sources, in order to deal with the Chongqing Chiang regime, the Chinese Communist Party has specifically determined the so-called "1-2-7 Forward New Policy." The content of the policy is to allocate one-tenth of their strength to advocate resistance against Japan, two-tenths of their strength to protect their own base areas, and seven-tenths of their strength to seek to expand their territory. Currently, Chongqing is also planning two measures to deal with this new policy of the Communist Party: to use political means to negotiate and to adopt an encirclement offensive. First, Chiang Ching-kuo, the eldest son of Chiang Kai-shek, went to Yan'an twice for negotiations. At the same time, he ordered the encirclement of the Eighteenth Group Army, the Eighth Route Army, and the New Fourth Army. In addition, news has come that the Chongqing army has been pressing the New Fourth Army from North China towards eastern Anhui. In order to cope with the Chongqing army's encirclement plan, the Sixth Division of the New Fourth Army has been stationed in Guangde, Langxi, and Xinchang, the Eighth Division has been stationed in Tianmashan, and the Seventh Division has begun to move towards Nanling.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chongqing side's measures to deal with the Eighth Route Army, the Chongqing side has dispatched Hu Zongnan, Ma Hongda, and Fu Zuoyi's troops to encircle Yan'an, totaling as many as 150,000 people. The Communist Party members who have been subjected to repression include He Long, Liu Bocheng, Lü Zhengcao, Nie Rongzhen, Xu Xiangqian, and Xiao Jinguang, with a total of more than 80,000 troops. A conflict occurred on December 14th of last year, and the total damage to both sides was that the special service brigade of Xiao Jinguang's communist army was completely annihilated, and a regiment of the 115th Division was killed or wounded. Lü Zhengcao and Xu Xiangqian's troops also suffered considerable damage, no less than 9,000 people. The Chongqing army lost two regiments of the 167th Division, one regiment of the 78th Division, and one battalion of the 28th Division, with a total of more than 7,000 killed or wounded. It is heard that Ma Hongda's troops have increased by two divisions, and they are now pressing the communist army on the Zhongtiao Mountain side, reducing the encirclement.</p>
<p>Most Indians Suspect British Promises to India</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 13th (Central News Agency) - Currently, Britain is asking India to cooperate in the war on the condition that it will allow India independence after the war. On February 26th, the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published an article criticizing that Britain intends to use India as a base to launch a counter-offensive. The biggest reasons why it has not been realized are two: first, the British fleet cannot navigate to the Indian Ocean; second, the situation in India cannot improve before the counter-offensive base can be implemented, but is getting worse. Recent British news reported that Britain and India have a cooperation plan, but what is the tendency of the Indian people? Most Indians suspect that Britain will allow India independence after the war. The situation in India is getting worse, which is worrying. It is not within the power of the British to solve this difficult situation.</p>
<p>Italy Appoints New Army Chief of Staff</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Huitong News Agency: General Piche has been appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Italian Army. The former Chief of Staff, General Gambara, has resigned. Mussolini sent a letter of thanks to Gambara for his contributions to the reorganization of the Italian Army.</p>
<h3>Soviet Influence in Xinjiang Grows Daily, Anglo-Soviet Relations in the Province Worsen</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: News from the Northwest indicates that according to the new agreement concluded last year between the Soviet Union and Sheng Shicai, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, the Soviet Union recently lent Sheng Shicai a large sum of money, amounting to tens of millions of rubles. It is said that Xinjiang will use the funds to develop hydroelectric power plants and coal mines. On the one hand, the Soviet Union is sending people to Xinjiang to purchase large quantities of sheepskin, cotton, beef, horses, etc., to be transported to the Soviet Union for exchange. They are also sending technicians to Xinjiang to assist in the development of hydroelectric power plants and coal mines, and agricultural specialists to northern Xinjiang to carry out agricultural improvement work. Furthermore, it is reported that there are now permanent Soviet military specialists stationed in Xinjiang, serving as professors in the province's military academies and training Sheng's troops. It is said that three divisions of Soviet-style troops have now been established. Yu Fang had previously sent Zhu Shaoliang to Xinjiang to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence and to discuss the issue of stationing Central Government troops in Xinjiang with Sheng. At that time, the British opposed this approach. Currently, Soviet influence has spread to Xinjiang, and Anglo-Soviet relations in Xinjiang, in particular, are deteriorating. Xinjiang has announced a halt to trade with India, and the Soviet Union has instigated Sheng to force Indian merchants to return home. Therefore, Anglo-Soviet relations in Xinjiang are worsening daily.</p>
<p>Sweden Holds Air Defense Drill</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): A German news agency reports that the Stockholm Home Guard and fire personnel held an air defense drill in the Souter district outside the city last night. According to local newspapers, King Gustav V, Minister of Defense Sköld, Commander-in-Chief of the Swedish Armed Forces, and the local governor observed the realistic drill. Afterwards, the Crown Prince and Princess reviewed the personnel who participated in the drill.</p>
<h3>Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers, Dönitz Delivers Speech, National Unity Will Certainly Overcome the Enemy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): Grand Admiral Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, said in a radio address on Sunday, Germany's Memorial Day for Unknown Heroes, "In this war, Germany is paying tribute to the fallen soldiers on all land, sea, and air fronts for the fifth time. We also commemorate the men, women, and children who were victims of the horrific air raids. We bow our heads in respect for their sacrifice and endure their passing with a cry of pride." Grand Admiral Dönitz emphasized that every German today knows that Germany is engaged in the most serious and ruthless battle. The various events in this war and the enemy's wild ambitions show the German people all the dangers of this war. He also said that this war was forced upon Germany by the enemy. "The enemy acted rashly and arrogantly, and with a false and hypocritical heart, pretended to protect the interests of the Polish people and wanted to prevent the unification of German brothers." Grand Admiral Dönitz solemnly declared that this ruthless and unavoidable war is a war related to the life and death of the German nation, but the German people know that in this great battle, they are fortunate to have a leader given to the German nation by God, and therefore they will be able to endure the trials. In the past few years, the enemy has used its enormous strength of manpower and material resources to try to break into the living space of Germany and its allies, but everywhere it has failed to break through a decisive gap. If the German leader had not reorganized the German armed forces ten years ago, then the German homeland today would be unimaginable. Only the German army can repel the enemy's fierce attacks, otherwise the Bolshevik torrent would have swept away our people and European culture." Grand Admiral Dönitz emphasized that "the German nation, due to the determination and unyielding strength of the domestic front, will overcome this battle. The great strength of the German nation lies in the unity of command of the internal and external fronts. Under this unified command, Germany has become an invincible country. Germany, with this unyielding attitude, will obtain the peace that a righteous country should enjoy. Therefore, the best way for us to thank the fallen heroes is to swear allegiance to the country and the leader and prepare to make the greatest sacrifices until victory comes."</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State May Visit Soviet Capital</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a German news agency report from Washington, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles may visit Moscow after visiting London. Welles will soon depart from Washington for London to hold consultations with British government officials.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces on the Southern Sector of the Eastern Front Adopt Scythe and Hammer Tactics, German Retreat Proceeds Smoothly</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to the German News Agency, the resistance of the German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front against General Zhukov's large-scale offensive is gradually increasing. The planned German retreat is proceeding very smoothly. The threat of German forces being encircled and defeated has now been eliminated. General Zhukov's tactics are not new. The Soviet army is launching large-scale offensives at various points on the front in an attempt to encircle large areas. The Soviet army has been using these tactics for a long time. The Soviet side claims that the Soviet army is using the "scythe and hammer tactics" for the first time in the recent battles. The German side rejects this, saying that the Soviet army's "scythe-shaped action" on the southern sector of the Eastern Front and the "hammer action" on the top of the front have not achieved decisive success. As the German army retreated, some troops had already retreated to the Bug River. The Soviet army's attempt to cross the river upstream failed. The fighting in the eastern part of the battlefield is taking place in barren land. Air activity on the Crimean front became active again over the weekend. On the central sector of the Eastern Front, after the Soviet army stopped its offensive on the Smolensk-Orel highway and southeast of Vitebsk, the fighting has calmed down. Near Nevel, the Soviet army has transferred fresh troops to participate in the war, so fierce fighting is in progress. On the northern sector of the front, such as Ostrov, Pustoschka, and the Narva area, there are fierce battles, but they are not as important as the vehicles on the southern sector.</p>
<p>Anti-Axis Aircraft Blindly Bomb Italian and French Cities</p>
<p>Xianglin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): On the 11th, anti-Axis aircraft bombed civilian residences and cultural monuments in the Italian cities of Padua and Florence, causing heavy damage. The 13th-century Church of the Eremitani was almost completely destroyed. Florence was bombed for three quarters of an hour. In order to preserve irreplaceable works of art, the German army did not station troops in Florence, but it could not avoid the invasion of British and American aircraft. German and Italian fighters encountered the bad weather and shot down 21 of them.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a report from Toulon, on the 11th, anti-Axis bomber squadrons, under the cover of fighter planes, raided the port of Toulon and blindly bombed the bustling areas of the city, causing the collapse of post offices, guild halls, and many other buildings, as well as many civilian casualties.</p>
<p>U.S. to Impose Economic Pressure on Ireland, Britain Bans Travel Between Britain and Ireland</p>
<p>Geneva, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): According to a German news agency report from Washington published by the Exchange Telegraph, the diplomatic community in Washington expects the United States to implement unfavorable economic measures against Ireland.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): After the Irish government refused to comply with the demands of the British and American governments to close down Axis agencies, the British government retaliated by banning travel between Britain and Ireland. According to a report from London, the British Home Office announced on the 12th that it would not issue travel permits to British nationals and the island of Ireland. Furthermore, the British government will no longer issue return certificates to Irish workers in Britain.</p>
<h3>Pope Issues Appeal Not to Destroy Rome and Expresses Deep Sympathy for Italian Refugees</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 13th (Central News Agency telegram): Pope Pius XII yesterday issued a strong appeal to the belligerent parties, asking them not to destroy Rome with ruthless aerial warfare. Believers in Rome and refugees from southern Italy gathered in St. Peter's Square to listen to the Pope's speech. He said that bombing the Holy City is illegal from any point of view, so he asked the responsible parties on both sides of the war to do everything possible to avoid bombing this helpless city. In his twenty-minute speech, the Pope expressed deep sympathy for the Italian refugees, saying that he had tried to prevent the outbreak of war, but after failing, he immediately devoted himself to alleviating the suffering of war in various countries.</p>
<p>Observations on the Current Situation in the Pacific War from German and Neutral Countries</p>
<p>The American landing in the Marshalls, the attack on Truk, and the Japanese offensive in Burma have brought a new look to the military situation in East Asia. As a result, a portion of the Japanese cabinet was reorganized, and the command of the army and navy was also changed. These epoch-making facts have made the German people more concerned about Japan. Recently, U.S. Fleet Commander Nimitz said in a meeting with reporters:</p>
<p>1. It is impossible to conquer Japan from the sea alone. The United Kingdom and the United States must quickly transport land and air forces to China or land on its coast to promote the defeat of Japan.</p>
<p>The Deutsche Zeitung commented that Nimitz's words were tantamount to admitting the difficulty of his offensive against Japan. Its argument is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Although the U.S. military has recently advanced in the Solomon Islands and the Marshall Islands, it has paid an extremely high price. The U.S. military wants to continue its island-hopping operations against the original defense perimeter of Japan, such as Truk, Iwo Jima, Saipan, and the Mariana Islands. Japan is expected to launch a more fierce counter-offensive, and even if it succeeds, the U.S.'s massive military production capacity will not be able to bear the burden of continuing to invade Japan's inner defense line.</p>
<p>2. On the other hand, Mountbatten's campaign to recover Burma, although considered the most urgent, has been forced to retreat due to encountering a brave counter-offensive.</p>
<p>3. Therefore, try to land on the coast of the South China Sea. In the current situation, hoping for success is just a pipe dream.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States have too much expectation for Chongqing</p>
<p>4. Nimitz's statement is in line with what American military commentators Hanson and Baldwin said in the New York Times. Baldwin said: "The British and American authorities have too much expectation for the Chongqing army, which is a big mistake. The British and American armies should use their own land forces to land on the Chinese mainland to drive out the Japanese and make them surrender." Such shallow insights should be denied. Furthermore, it is a pipe dream to over-believe in the idea that "air power can win."</p>
<p>5. Speaking of strengthening air control over Japan, U.S. Air Force Commander Chennault recently said: "To attack Japan with air raids like today's attacks on Chongqing, it would be enough to send one-tenth of the air force that the United Kingdom and the United States are sending to Europe." He argued that the air force stationed in Chongqing was too weak in number, and said: "For the air force stationed in Chongqing to obtain the necessary replenishment, it must be based on the premise that the South China coast to the Yangtze River and the railways to North China are restored to the hands of the anti-Axis."</p>
<p>This fully illustrates the difficulty of the U.S. Air Force's operations in Chongqing.</p>
<p>6. In short, the U.S. military is overestimating the attack on Truk Island and promoting the imminent large-scale offensive against Japan, which is nothing more than an aid to the domestic Roosevelt's fourth election campaign.</p>
<p>Another part of the German people believe that the current American offensive against Japan is only a temporary attempt by the anti-Axis forces to extend their foothold for the offensive against Japan before the start of the large-scale offensive against Europe. On the contrary, some people observe that the United Kingdom and the United States, in view of the subtle relations between Europe and the Soviet Union, want to temporarily focus their main forces on the distant Pacific region.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the United States are forced to fight on two fronts</p>
<p>In short, the United Kingdom and the United States are dispersing their forces in Europe and the Pacific, and are forced to fight on two fronts. There is no doubt about this. As for the results of the American offensive against Japan, the aforementioned Deutsche Zeitung's discussion can represent the views of German intellectuals. Regarding the close coordination of Japan's military and political orders, the British and American sides arbitrarily speculate, while the German side believes that this was originally a pending issue for Japan, and that at this decisive stage, military actions need to be decided and implemented immediately, and military actions and the highest political system need to be integrated. All of this has been resolved in this measure. As a result, Japan's entire military operation can be used more rationally, and great expectations are placed on it. (Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, March 1)</p>
<p>Regarding the increasingly fierce battles in the South Pacific, the Swiss Zurich Daily published an article entitled "The Anti-War Core Army's Offensive Against Japan," which reviewed the anti-Axis counter-offensive operations that began in the summer of 1942. From a neutral standpoint, it explained the significance of the anti-Axis offensive and predicted the future operational goals of the anti-Axis forces as follows:</p>
<p>"The anti-Axis army's attack on Japanese bases is to first launch a large-scale advance with aircraft carriers and base air forces, approach Japanese bases under their air supremacy, use naval gun fire, and then carry out landings with ground troops under their cover. If they can land, they will turn it into a naval and air base and carry out another operation using the same tactics. This is the so-called island-hopping operation." In this strategy of the anti-Axis army, what is noteworthy is that although the anti-Axis army dispatched a fleet to approach the central area of Japanese defense, it did not receive effective resistance from the Japanese fleet, which seems to be unfavorable to Japan. Of course, the Japanese fleet is still there, its battleships have great combat power, and the Japanese navy uses this fleet with extreme caution. Just thinking about the numerical superiority of the United Kingdom and the United States, the Japanese navy is of course taking this attitude in the current war.</p>
<p>Current Situation of the British and American Navies</p>
<p>So what is the current strength of the British and American navies? The exact number is unknown, but what has been reported before is as follows:</p>
<p>1. Five Montana-class battleships exceeding 60,000 tons, which began to be built from 1941, are expected to have been commissioned.</p>
<p>2. Five Iowa-class battleships over 50,000 tons, which began to be built from 1940 to 1941, have now been seen participating in Pacific operations.</p>
<p>3. Six Washington-class battleships over 40,000 tons have been commissioned in the past three years.</p>
<p>4. In addition, there seem to be battleships being built.</p>
<p>5. There are more than ten aircraft carriers in addition to those previously lost.</p>
<p>6. There are more than seventy small escort carriers.</p>
<p>7. The United Kingdom has at least several battleships that can be used in the anti-Japanese war in the Pacific. This is possible from the current strength of the surrendered fleets of France and Italy and the German fleet.</p>
<p>Japanese Fleet Awaits</p>
<p>The anti-Axis army has been able to take large-scale operational actions due to its numerical superiority in the naval and air forces, and Japanese bases are gradually being adversely affected. The most obvious operational goals of the anti-Axis forces are now Rabaul and Truk. Regarding the Battle of Rabaul, the anti-Axis forces are bombing the port itself and bombing ships that are replenishing ammunition and food. This operation must be started from a base far away from the Japanese position. This illustrates the difficulty of directly attacking a naval and air base with solid fortifications. Moreover, the goal of these operations of the anti-Axis forces is to obtain a U.S. Air Force offensive base in order to control the air over Japan. In short, Japan will not be confused by being subjected to partial blows, and is currently strengthening its best defense posture. In partial operations, the dispatch of the fleet will be extremely cautious. Recently, General Tojo and Admiral Shimada were appointed as the Chief of the General Staff and the Chief of the Naval General Staff. This shows Japan's determination to use its best efforts to defeat the anti-Axis offensive, and to establish new anti-offensive operations to cope with the anti-Axis offensive operations with material resources as the greatest weapon.

<h3>Bailianjing Chinese Alcohol Factory Donated to Japanese Navy, Donation Ceremony Held at Naval Attaché's Residence Yesterday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Allied Japan is using the strength of the whole country to carry out the Greater East Asia War, striving for the liberation of the East Asian nations, and our people are providing all possible assistance in material and spirit to achieve this great goal. It has been learned that Dong Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Jianyuan Co., Ltd., a large entrepreneur in this city, had previously heard that the Japanese Navy was currently looking for an alcohol factory. On the 9th, the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, he explained to the Naval Attaché's Office that he was willing to donate the entire Chinese Alcohol Factory plant in Bailianjing, Pudong, to the Japanese Navy. The Japanese naval authorities were deeply grateful for accepting Dong's kindness and held a donation ceremony at the Naval Attaché's residence last night. Those present included Dong Jiangquan, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Jianyuan Co., Ltd., Tan Yinkang, Manager of the company, and representatives from other relevant parties. The Japanese side was represented by Rear Admiral Kondo, who gave a speech of thanks. According to reports, the factory was initially operated with a capital of 1.5 million yuan and was the most modern alcohol factory. It was once shut down due to the Sino-Japanese Incident and was later managed by the Japanese army and entrusted to Kamejiro Ohashi for operation. In October of the year before last, military management was lifted, and it was returned to our side and renamed the Mainland Alcohol Factory.</p>
<p>Attaché Kondo's speech: This time, the Chinese alcohol is necessary for our navy, and it has been donated automatically. This is an expression of Mr. Dong and all of you in your factory's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. I am truly grateful. This Greater East Asia War is a great war unprecedented in history. To achieve its goal, it must go through many twists and turns, and the war will become more and more fierce, but the final victory will belong to us without any doubt. Today, the automatic donation of this Chinese alcohol factory often has an important mission in our naval operations, which is unnecessary to say. I would like to express my respect and gratitude to you on behalf of the Imperial Navy.</p>
<h3>Managing Directors and Supervisors of the National Chamber of Commerce Unified Association Continue to Hold Office, Executive Yuan Will Continue to Appoint</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Since the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Unified Association under orders, it has been one year until the 15th of this month. In accordance with the wartime economic control policy guidelines promulgated by the National Government, the material control of major commodities is implemented, especially rice, wheat flour, edible oil, salt, and cotton. The unified collection and distribution has completed its steps. Recently, there have been strong rumors that the term of office of the managing directors and supervisors of the association has expired and will be re-elected. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently learned from the authorities of the Material Control Review Committee that the managing directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce were originally assigned to take charge of the control work and were allowed to be responsible for handling it for one year. Although the articles of association of the Chamber of Commerce did not stipulate a fixed term of office for the managing directors and supervisors, they were to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to send someone else to be responsible for maintaining the control work and resign from their posts at the end of the one-year term. Although the current Executive Yuan authorities have not formally announced a decision, it is said that the managing directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce are all well-known people in the city's financial and industrial circles. Since the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce, under the supervision of the highest authorities of the Executive Yuan and the Material Control Review Committee, they have been able to convey the ruling intentions of the National Government, so the administrative directors of the Chamber of Commerce The Executive Yuan will still appoint them to continue to serve and promote the control mission.</p>
<p>Nanshi to Install Alarm Bells Everywhere</p>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Since the iron gates in Nanshi, on the 1st and 7th of each month, have been opened separately, the traffic in the two districts is unobstructed, which is convenient for pedestrians. If given some time, all industries in Nanshi will be able to achieve considerable progress. In order to ensure the security and stability of the Yushi area, the Municipal Baojia Committee intends to follow the example of the first district and widely install alarm bells to eliminate crimes invisibly. It is reported that the association has ordered merchants to prepare quotations for approval.</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Held Regular Press Conference Yesterday</h3>
<p>The regular press conference hosted by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China was held as usual at 2:30 pm yesterday (13th) on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The embassy side included Information Minister Matsudaira and Vice Consul Fukuma. Minister Matsudaira gave a detailed account of the world situation in the past week, which lasted for two hours.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Held School Lecture</h3>
<p>The 15th school lecture of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association in this city was held yesterday at the auditorium of Zhendan University. More than 1,000 students from Shanghai Huxin, Chongshi, and Xingzhong schools attended, and the principals of the three schools were invited to participate.

<h3>Nanshi People's Organizations Cooperate to Remove Garbage</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Committee has successively established public warehouses in Shanghai, Nanjing, Dongtai, and other places. Recently, the committee plans to expand the flower-receiving area. In view of the fact that the cotton production in Anhui Province is also quite abundant, in order to facilitate storage, a public warehouse has been added in Anqing, bringing the total number of public warehouses previously established to nine. Furthermore, the committee stipulates that all cotton merchants participating in flower receiving must be registered and licensed, and all cotton received must be stored in public warehouses.</p>
<h3>Songshima Press Officer Refutes Britain and America's Hypocritical Propaganda, Attempting to Conceal Defeats in Counteroffensive Operations</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that Colonel Songshima, the press officer of the Japanese Navy stationed in China, met with reporters yesterday (the 13th). He severely criticized the enemy, Britain and America, for their anxiety over repeated defeats in their Pacific counteroffensive operations and Burma operations, and for their recent major hypocritical propaganda, attempting to conceal the truth.</p>
<p>Britain and America's Operations Lack Goals</p>
<p>Colonel Songshima stated, "This war is called the Greater East Asia War by our Empire, and it has a constructive grand goal. On the contrary, the enemy, Britain and America, have no central goal, only attempting to fulfill their ambition to conquer the world." He added, "Comprehensive enemy propaganda over the past week reflects the failure of the United States in the central Pacific operations and the setbacks suffered by Britain in the Burma operations. Their strategic propaganda is not as boastful as it used to be, but their political propaganda is becoming more energetic." He said, "Their goal is to intimidate weak neutral countries. Regarding their strategic propaganda, the United States expressed dissatisfaction with Britain's Burma operations on the 6th, while the British Governor-General of India sent a telegram to encourage Mountbatten, which was a major satire on the United States, leaving the intermediary side between Britain and America in a dilemma. On the 7th, they frankly admitted the difficulty of the Burma operations."</p>
<p>Enemy Propaganda is Divided and Inconsistent</p>
<p>Following this, on the 8th, Britain announced that bombing Japan was indeed possible. British Naval Secretary Alexander strongly advocated strengthening operations against Japan in the House of Commons and made a judgment. "A number of British naval forces can be deployed in the Pacific." On the 9th, it was reported that the American Knox and Nimitz had met in Washington. The above search propaganda only revealed that Britain and America were shifting responsibility to each other and had no new meaning. As for their political propaganda, there are too many to list. For example, on the 6th, Britain and the United States disagreed fiercely over the Afghan oil issue. On the 7th, Britain withdrew its military envoys stationed in Turkey and stopped supplying Turkey with arms. On the 8th, Britain also took political offensive actions against Turkey, but British Eden avoided mentioning the Turkish issue in Parliament. One point is even more noteworthy: the British left-wing is very concerned about the Chinese Communist Party. On the 7th, the British Communist Party's organ newspaper, "Sunday Worker," extensively publicized the CCP. Also, regarding the Soviet-Finnish issue, Finland has not yet responded to the Soviet Union's peace proposal. As mentioned above, the enemy's propaganda is divided and inconsistent, but all kinds of propaganda are nothing more than a hollow attempt by Britain and America, who have repeatedly failed in direct attacks against Japan and Germany, using different means."</p>
<p>Deceptive Tactics Conceal Defeats</p>
<p>Finally, it is even more important to note that regarding the strategy of Britain toward the conquered areas, it is said that in early March, British and American envoys in Chongqing requested Chiang Kai-shek to allow British and American ground troops, in addition to the air force, to also enter mainland China, but this was ultimately opposed by Chongqing. Also, such as the American Congress saying: giving Chinese or Indians the right to enter the country, this point is not worth mentioning, because can Chinese and Indians still walk across the ocean to America during wartime? In the future, when the war is over and more Chinese people go to America, they will be met with closed doors, which is an expected thing. The United States is not only deceiving the Chinese, but any Asians who are slightly careless will fall into their trap. Britain and America, suffering major setbacks in this Pacific mobile operation and the Burma counteroffensive operation, rely solely on deceptive propaganda warfare, attempting to conceal their defeats, but the facts are obvious, how can they hide everything from the eyes and ears of the world?</p>
<h3>Economic Circles Comment on Clearing Out the Poison</h3>
<p>The abandonment of poison by today's economic circles is more harmful to the country than the toxins of opium are to the human body. Therefore, the anti-poison movement in the economic circles is undoubtedly more important and urgent than any other anti-poison movement. The economic circles' anti-poison movement was launched and implemented once last year when collecting coarse cloth, but it was not thoroughly implemented, resulting in "catching small fish and letting go of big fish." The effect at that time was too small. Since then, speculators have become more aware of the inadequacy of national laws and have intensified their efforts, becoming unscrupulous, ultimately turning hoarding and speculation into official-supervised merchant operations, and the price problem has become extremely serious.</p>
<p>The core of the price problem lies in exerting political power. The government's published regulations on punishing hoarding are indeed stricter and more specific than in the past, but whether they have the effect of suppressing prices depends on the means and steps of implementation. This is the consistent opinion of our media circles for the past two years, so there is no need to reiterate it. This time, the National Government resolutely rectified official corruption, not hesitating to submit senior government officials to a special court for strict interrogation and punishment according to law. At the same time, the authorities not only strictly ordered merchants not to engage in illegal transactions, but also prohibited civil servants from engaging in commercial activities. If anyone dares to hoard major commodities, finished products, or raw materials, once found to be true, they will be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment of 15 years or more according to the court. Such a fact and such a law cannot but be said to be a powerful measure for rectifying official corruption. It is hoped that the government authorities will, with this determination, diligently govern and persevere, so that the Chinese economic circles after clearing out the poison will have hope of recovery from now on.</p>
<h3>Rice and Grain Loan Syndicate Adopts Acceptance Bill System with an Annual Interest Rate of 8%, Limited to 700 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>In order to promote the purchasing work and alleviate the difficulties of purchasing merchants, the Rice and Grain Control Committee borrowed a large sum of money from banks such as the Bank of China on December 18 last year and signed a general agreement to provide funds for purchasing rice and grain loans. However, the payment method adopted the acceptance bill system, which purchasing merchants requested the loan syndicate to discount. It is reported that this loan is guaranteed by the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Reserve Bank is willing to rediscount the acceptance bills.</p>
<p>Second Phase of Matches and Soap in Nanshi to Be Sold Soon</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that regarding daily necessities such as matches and soap, the Nanshi area has long been supervised by the city's Baojia Committee to implement distribution. The second phase will begin to be sold in the near future. The Nanshi Office of the Shanghai Cigarette, Match, Soap, and Candle Industry Association, in order to help strengthen the distribution mechanism and rectify the industry, yesterday specially sent letters to its affiliated shops, stating that henceforth, the sale of distributed goods should be in accordance with the original quality and quantity, and must not be ambiguous.</p>
<p>Nanshi People's Organizations Cooperate in Clearing Garbage</p>
<p>Garbage accumulation in the entire Nanshi area has not yet had a concrete solution for removal. The season of epidemics is approaching in an instant, which has a great impact on the health of citizens. The Nanshi Sanitation Office has had a request to increase funding due to financial difficulties, but the matter is too slow to address the urgent need. Therefore, the Shanghai Nanshi People's Welfare Association, in consideration of the health of the people in Nanshi, convened a meeting of Nanshi people's organizations at the association at 3 PM yesterday to jointly discuss a plan to cooperate in clearing garbage. It is reported that an agreement has been reached and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Business Leaders Organize the China Industrial Association to Promote the Production Increase Movement and Will Establish It Soon</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports that during this Greater East Asia War, increasing production and suppressing prices are important policies adopted by the National Government. However, in order for it to be effective, it cannot be done without the joint cooperation of the people. Business leaders in this city, including Wen Ruiting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Fu _, and Zhang Deqin, believe that the business community has always lacked welcome and even fewer comprehensive plans. In order to strengthen the industrial structure and strive to increase production to adapt to the needs of the current environment, they have invited various industries to promote it. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and the municipal authorities of this city deeply appreciate the business community's self-motivated efforts to promote production. The association has been actively preparing for several months, and the participants are all well-known people from all walks of life. It will be held soon</p>
<p>City Women's Association Prepares to Establish a Midwifery Fund Committee</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Women's Association, in order to promote the welfare of women in general and relieve the poor, has launched a plan to form a midwives from all walks of life. The conference was held on the fourth floor of 960 Da Shanghai Road (Avenue Edward VII) to discuss the progress. Qu Zhonglun, Chairman of the Association, took the chair and immediately passed the draft charter of the Midwifery Committee and the application method for the management of the Midwifery Fund and other important motions. And designated Qu Zhonglun, Feng Wenfeng. Wu Qinghu. Lin Meishu. Pan _ Dai. Wu Yingzhi. Yuan Huiyu. Fang Jinying. Liu Baizhi. Yu Yuxiu. Zhang Zhixue. Cheng Zhenxian. Zhang Bingyao and other thirteen people as members, and designated Qu Zhonglun as the chairman and Pan Liudai as the secretary. The association will continue to discuss the implementation strategy at the News Federation next week.</p>
<p>Land Procuratorate Detention Center to Be Disinfected Starting Today</p>
<p>Wang, the director of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate Detention Center, said that recently there have been many deaths of criminals due to illness. He said: Since the establishment of this center last year, the number of criminals has been increasing daily, reaching 1,500, but the funds are limited, and the internal supply is quite tight, so various sanitary facilities cannot be handled. Moreover, due to the lack of coal, the bathing habits of criminals when they enter the place and the daily regulations are suspended. Moreover, because 19 of the criminals are small thieves and pickpockets, they are ragged and dirty, causing a foul smell to spread. When they occasionally get sick, the infection spreads. Regarding this issue, I have consulted with the relevant authorities several times. A solution has been found for the coal issue. On the other hand, I have asked the Health Department of the First District Office to implement disinfection work starting tomorrow (the 14th) to prevent the spread of diseases and ensure the safety of prisoners' lives. At the same time, the Land Procuratorate will also grant bail based on the severity of the prisoners' cases to avoid overcrowding of prisoners.</p>

<h3>National Forum: Random Protection of the Chinese Stock Market</h3>
<p>Nian Lin</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, taking Shanghai as an example, with the strengthening of the control facilities, open hoarding and speculative activities such as gold standard, foreign exchange, and coarse cloth have all been severely blocked. Therefore, the public's attention has shifted to Chinese stock trading. Since the resumption of the securities exchange's auction of _ stocks, _ stocks have had a formal market and public market price. In addition to people who usually engage in the buying and selling of goods, gold standard, foreign exchange, and coarse cloth shifting their attention to Chinese stocks, the general salary class who participate in buying _ Chinese stocks are increasing in number. Because the procedures are simple and it is easier to make profits, stock trading can be said to be popular among all levels of Shanghai. Most of these citizens do not have much surplus to invest. In fact, they are forced by the high cost of living, so they pawn and sell or operate in partnership in order to make a profit. However, since the malignant expansion of industrial securities in the second half of last year, this salary class has been greatly affected.</p>
<p>In terms of financial institutions, the total number of investments in industrial securities in recent years has not been formally counted, but based on general observations, the number is often not small. Since industrial securities have had a public market, mortgage loans using Chinese stocks as collateral are everywhere. Especially since the strict implementation of controlled economy, people are generally afraid that commodities will be subject to controlled purchase, while stocks can be freely circulated. Therefore, the collaterals received by the pawnshops are generally stocks. This spring, stock prices plummeted, causing borrowers to be unable to repay the loans, which affected the pawnshops' liquidity. The high interest rates for interbank lending were shocking. Financial institutions had to sell stocks at a loss in order to adjust their liquidity, only seeking to obtain liquidity and not hesitating to cut flesh to heal sores. As a result, stock prices became lower and lower, and the black market interest rates became higher and higher. Banks with solid foundations can still support it, but pawnshops with weaker strength may have been riddled with holes. Is this the blessing of the social economy? Moreover, even pawnshops with sufficient liquidity will regard investing in securities as a dangerous path in the future and shift their capital to direct domestic goods. As a result, stock prices will fall further, commodity prices will be higher, society will become more uneasy, and people's livelihood will become less peaceful.</p>
<p>The current depression in the Shanghai stock market has a great impact, as mentioned above. If the responsible authorities do not strive to provide relief, the repetition of the XinHai Revolution financial crisis may be possible. The impact will not only abandon the hard work of officials and merchants in maintaining the Chinese stock market in the past few years, but it will also be difficult to regain the trust of the general public in building an industrial securities market in the future.</p>
<p>What we now expect from the competent authorities and official leading banks is to not only make prior supervision in the active aspect for the securities market, but also make ex post facto remedy in the passive aspect. Because maintaining the securities market is to protect the interests of investors, and protecting the interests of investors is also to encourage the public's interest in investing in securities and increase the source of industrial capital. In this decline in Chinese stock prices, the competent authorities should urge official leading banks to carefully review the asset actual value of the listed stock companies. If the net assets exceed the total market value of the issued stocks, the official banks should release currency to buy stocks. In this way, on the one hand, the market price of securities can be maintained, the market's silver root will naturally loosen, and the lending interest can also be reduced. At the same time, it can also strengthen the government's control over industry. If the stock market price rises unreasonably in the future, the official leading banks can sell their stocks to contract the currency.</p>
<p>The above is a passive remedy. We hope even more that the competent authorities can prevent problems before they occur, which is to strengthen prior supervision. The competent authorities should conduct a detailed and appropriate investigation and public announcement of the operating conditions and asset and liability status of the Chinese stocks that are being raised, regardless of whether the issuer is a newly established company or an existing old company, in order to protect the interests of investors. For newly established companies, the funds should be verified and the accounts should be audited. In order to learn from the past, when a new company is established in the future, the funds should be handed over to an official bank first. After the official bank issues a certificate, it can be approved to hold an inaugural meeting and register. In this way, cunning people will not be able to collude with unsound financial institutions to falsely establish companies with insufficient content by stealing the sky and changing the sun to harm society. Secondly, the local economic and administrative authorities should strictly implement the regular supervision of enterprises, and review at ordinary times whether the business operations of each enterprise are consistent with the provisions of its articles of association and whether it engages in activities outside the scope of business, which affects the safety of investors' funds. If it is found that the person in charge of the enterprise has committed illegal or regulatory violations, it should be reported truthfully and punished according to law, so that the bad actors in the business community cannot stand and protect the interests of investors.</p>
<p>Again, the stock exchange authorities should recognize the function of the securities market to guide social funds to flow into productive business, and stocks issued by non-productive business and factories that have stopped work should not be allowed to circulate. Also, when stock prices rise and fall too much, the reasons for the rise should be investigated to determine whether someone is manipulating them in secret in order to seek illegal profits. Also, when stock prices suddenly fall, it should also be thoroughly investigated whether someone is taking the opportunity to sell short in an attempt to profit. It should be known that although the exchange is a business institution, it should also be responsible for protecting investors. Therefore, when illegal and opportunistic behavior is discovered in the market, the exchange authorities should first conduct an impartial investigation to avoid being held accountable for others. At the same time, when reviewing the stocks of listed companies, a stricter attitude should be taken, and it should not be too excessive. Not only should emphasis be placed on written reports, but also on the actual investigation. This investigation work can be carried out by exchange staff or entrusted to a credit agency to clarify whether its assets are sufficient and whether its operations are legal, as a standard for allowing its stock to be listed.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the central competent authorities will order all companies issuing stocks to publish their balance sheets and profit and loss statements every year, and order the local competent authorities to review and investigate them nearby, so that general investors can understand the financial situation of each company and will not suffer losses due to blind temptation when verifying investment objects.</p>
<p>Joint loan syndicate Borrowing Banks The Borrowing Banks A total of 19 banks including Bank of China formed _ named "Rice and Grain Purchasing Loan Syndicate One" with Bank of China as the representative bank to handle the syndicate's affairs. The loan method is to pay the discount applicant, that is, the purchasing merchant, to discount from the syndicate with the acceptance bills provided by the Rice Control Committee in succession. The total discount amount is continuously circulated to 700 million yuan in national currency, divided into 200 units, each unit is 3.5 million yuan, and each member bank recognizes and borrows units: China, Transportation, and Huaxing each 50 units, Zhejiang Xing, Shanghai, Jincheng, Continental, Zhong _ Reclamation, and Savings Society of Four Banks each 4 units: Zhejiang Real Estate, Salt Industry, Jiafu, Xinhua, Zhongnan, and Guohua each 3 units, Zhonghui, Tiaoye, China Enterprise, and China Industry each 2 units. However, when the discount applicant discounts to the syndicate with the acceptance bill, a separate discount contract shall be signed, which shall be certified by the Rice Control Committee. The discount rate is 8% per annum, which shall be deducted in advance on the discount date.</p>
<p>Association Dynamics Paper Industry Association The Shanghai Special City Paper Industry Association held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Xizang Road. There were 296 member units and 226 representatives actually present.

<h3>This Office Specifically Contracts with Various Hospitals to Provide Free Meningitis Vaccinations for the Poor</h3>
<p>Recently, the incidence of meningitis has been increasing daily. This newspaper has repeatedly called on citizens to pay attention to hygiene, and has published preventative measures and treatments. However, in view of the fact that ordinary citizens are generally concerned about hygiene and prevention, but are unable to seek medical treatment once they contract the disease, their lives are at risk. Therefore, for the sake of widespread prevention, we have specifically contracted with the following hospitals to provide free meningitis vaccinations for ordinary poor citizens. Anyone who wishes to be vaccinated can go directly to the respective hospital to apply, without the need for a written introduction from this office. This matter concerns the safety of citizens themselves, so please pay attention. As for those who are already ill and wish to be treated, they can register with this office to apply for a certificate, and we will introduce them to hospitals for free diagnosis and treatment, and provide medication. The hospitals are:</p>
<p>Pingmin Women and Children's Hospital (995 Connaught Road)</p>
<p>Foguang Sanatorium (123 Masnan Road)</p>
<p>Tongren Hospital (Jiujiang Road)</p>
<p>Ximen Women and Children's Hospital (Xujiahui Road)</p>
<p>Hongren Hospital (Chengdu Road, Avenue Edward VII)</p>
<p>Youzhu Hospital (129 Rue des Soeurs)</p>
<p>Shanghai Health Association (Opposite Zhang Garden, Jing'an Temple Road)</p>
<p>China Hospital (32 Ward Road)</p>
<p>Boai Hospital (Penglai Road, Nanshi)</p>
<p>Hudong Hospital (Meizhou Road, Yangshupu)</p>
<p>Buddhist Charity Clinic (Nanshi)</p>
<p>Deyi Hospital (Tongfu Road)</p>
<p>Dongnan Hospital (Nantong Road)</p>
<p>Shanghai Health Association (Opposite Zhang Tu, Jing'an Temple Road)</p>
<p>Hu People's Hospital (Da Xi Road)</p>
<p>World Red Cross Society Hospital (Yuwei Road)</p>
<p>Also, Dr. Yi Fei, in order to assist the health authorities and facilitate meningitis prevention for all sectors of society, will provide free meningitis vaccinations for citizens every day from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The address is 2nd Floor, Zheng'an Pharmacy, No. 2, Carter Road, Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Meningitis Treatment Certificate</p>
<p>Meningitis, in Chinese medicine, belongs to the category of typhoid fever, called spasm disease, and in children, it is called infantile convulsion. On March 11th, Mr. Zhang Ju published Mr. Dan Tieqiao's Annao Pills, which are an effective medicine for this disease. I have often heard of Mr. Dan's prescriptions, which include pueraria, antelope horn, , chrysanthemum, , Chuan Qiong and other flavors. Is this prescription also the method for treating meningitis? In the 29th year, when I was the director of the Suzhou National Medical Hospital, I encountered several cases of this disease. I imitated Mr. Dan's prescribed formula, and added bezoar, scorpion tail uncaria, and cicada slough, which were indeed very effective. Its medicinal properties have the functions of reducing inflammation, antipyretic, heart-invigorating, and spasmolytic, which is very reasonable when measured with new theories. As for Mr. Nie's method of smelling the nose, it is nothing more than using soap bean to stimulate the nasal mucosa, guiding the congested blood in the brain to relieve the pressure, which is not different from the Western medicine method of bloodletting to treat cerebral congestion. There are many places where Chinese medicine coincides with science, but no one has elaborated on it. What a pity! (Shu Er'an)</p>
<p>Editor's Note:</p>
<p>The Chinese remedy "Soap Bean" is suitable for places in remote rural areas where there are no local hospitals. It has been jointly manufactured by this office, Foci, and Tongren through pooled funds.

<p>After the Public Works Bureau issued an order to the city's bicycle owners to exchange for new licenses (for the first half of this year), the city's bicycle owners have successively gone to the traffic section of each administrative office to complete the exchange procedures, and many have already received the new hard and soft licenses. I also went to exchange for a new license for a friend a few days ago, but there is something I don't understand: the total amount of fees paid was 72 yuan, but the receipt I received only showed a total of 92 yuan. At that time, all those who exchanged for vehicle licenses were dissatisfied and asked the staff member in charge, but he pretended to be deaf and said nothing. Those who exchanged for vehicle licenses also had no objection. It has now become common practice. (Zhi Yicheng)</p>
<p>Master Kuqi Donates Baofu Method Again</p>
<p>The article "Baofu Method" is Master Sun Nie Yuntai's masterpiece during his illness, with profound implications. Three thousand copies are still sold at the cost price of two yuan per copy in the store, to support scholarships. In addition, Madam Zeng Jifen, Mr. Nie's mother, handwritten Duke Wenzheng's Family Instructions: "One person's advice makes the family healthy, diligence makes the family prosperous, diligence and frugality will never be poor." Lay Buddhist Rong Baiyun donated 300 small scrolls, each still sold for two yuan, all of which will be used to help the poor.</p>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association's current fundraising campaign for the education and upbringing of orphans has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. As of yesterday, a total of 432,915 yuan has been raised, but it is still far from the target. In addition to the fact that the association's standing committee members Lin Kanghou and Zhao Puqing have sent letters to each committee member to continue fundraising, it is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate to benefit the orphans.</p>
<p>Dr. Cao Offers Preferential Treatment to the Poor and Sick</p>
<p>Dr. Cao Zhifang, a renowned Chinese medicine doctor, is a student of Lu Tu, an internist. He is currently offering preferential treatment to the poor and sick at his senior brother's Qingjie Clinic (No. 5, Bai Bo Fang, Luban Road). For poor primary school teachers introduced by this newspaper, the consultation fee is waived.</p>
<p>Lost and Found: A string of keys was found in front of the Central Market gate in Shiliupu, Nanshi. The owner is requested to come to the secretary's office of the Hualian Tongle Association at No. 194 Nanjing Road between 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM every day to claim it. A small package of gold jewelry was picked up in bus No. 2 the afternoon before yesterday. The owner is requested to go to the Continental Company on the 3rd floor of No. 27 Hu Qing Road between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM every day (excluding Sundays and holidays) to claim it. (Wu Jiao)</p>
<p>Looking for Citizen's Certificate: I lost a leather bag at the intersection of Chengdu Road and Dagu Road on the evening of December. It contained Citizen's Certificate No. 72326. I hope that whoever finds it will return the citizen's certificate to me by mail, or send it to the social service department of this newspaper. (Zhu Jun)</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>It was late October when the orange bridge turned green again, and Makoto's energy had completely recovered. After the land combat exercises in the village of Hara, he returned to the student hall full of energy. After returning, he began to train hard for the sumo wrestling competition.</p>
<p>On that day, he received the report of the fall of Miaohang Town and Dachang Town, and the students' faces showed a triumphant color.</p>
<p>"Tani, someone said there's an express letter for you. Go to the instructor's office to get it."</p>
<p>When Makoto heard these words from the corporal, he suddenly thought of Takao. Perhaps Takao had come to Kure and sent him a letter. His heart was pounding.</p>
<p>However, his expectation was completely the opposite. It was an express letter from his fourth older brother. The letter was scrawled, stating that he had received a notice from the original unit, saying that his brother, Shinichiro, had already died in battle on October 4th.</p>
<p>(Ten)</p>
<p>A good older brother, although the second son, had the prestige of the eldest son in the family. Among his brothers, he was not the most handsome, but he was the most cheerful and robust, and he was also a busybody. He had been the secretary of the Shimoharata Kenmeisha (Healthy Children's Society), and was the head of the cheering squad during his time at the Second Middle School - he was indeed a healthy and energetic brother. And he especially loved Makoto. His mother and brother both relied on him.</p>
<p>(What must his mother be feeling!)</p>
<p>Makoto reread the express letter with tearful eyes. His brother Shinichiro had died in battle in Luodian Town, a suburb of Shanghai. Makoto did not know what kind of place it was, or what kind of battle he had fought, but he could imagine that his brother would have fought a surprising battle, and his death would have been noble. His brother Shinichiro, with his dark face and big eyes, his head under the low iron helmet, charging into the enemy ranks with a rifle, flashed through Makoto's mind in an instant.</p>
<p>Although Makoto shed tears, he also felt a kind of awe-inspiring and strong impulse.</p>
<p>(I can't lose either!)</p>
<p>The shout that he had often shouted in his heart since his father's death, during his elementary school days, was an incomparably more fervent and passionate shout that shook his eardrums.</p>
<p>His year and a half of life in Etajima had made him shout like this. The military consciousness that had unconsciously developed had made him do so. Because Makoto could not help but think that Shinichiro was a private first class, a customs official in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Although his brother must also have been a loyal soldier, he did not make a living as a soldier. On the contrary, Makoto himself, although a student, was dedicating his life to the national army. His position was different from his brother's. Yet his brother had died in battle first. In the Tani family, if there were to be casualties in battle, the first one should be himself -</p>
<p>This was not out of a petty desire for fame because his brother had achieved a glorious death. Rather, it was clear proof that Makoto was already thinking about everything from a military perspective.</p>
<p>He bit his lower lip tightly. He felt sorry for his brother, ashamed of his brother, and felt infinite love and sorrow for his brother - such complex waves were moving in his chest.</p>
<p>In short, Shinichiro's death had a major impact on Makoto. It was as if his concepts of the nation, family, and himself were completely presented before him because of this. Although outsiders did not know it, Makoto's words and deeds changed greatly from this point on.</p>
