<p>代論</p>
<h3>政治必勝論</h3>
<p>— 陳彬穌</p>
<p>本月二十七日本報星期評論，發表德富翁的「必勝政治」一文，深感德富翁的論點，頗與我們向所論列的相同，足供國人尤其是當政者的參攷。我們今天特選論題爲「政治必勝論」，就是說：「政治辦得好，即能獲得勝利」，也是說：「惟有把政治辦好，才能獲得勝利。」</p>
<p>德富翁說：一今日的政治家，如不考察人民的要求如何，這是一件大錯而特錯的事。政治家如把握到花木的要求，應澆水的時候澆水，應上肥料的時候上肥料，應剪枝的時候剪校，應除草的時候除草。又如醫生認識到病人的要求，這樣才能體味到政治的眞諦。政洽方面有一種確定的規則，必須詳細探究人民的心理，必須按規則行事，而不知花木的心理，雨天仍澆以水，則花木就有水浸之虞，這是由於未想到政治的關係。大則爲國，小則爲城鄉，全都是必需的。一道段話巳經充分說明了政治家應有的仟務。我們中國在目前的處境中，特別需要偉大的政治家，需要他們爭取民心，把握人民的要求，做澆水上肥料剪枝的工作。根據這種需要，今臼中國的政治家必須具備下列條件：</p>
<p>能爲國家民族的復興計刻，作近則十年，遠則五十年一百年的打算。</p>
<p>有任勞任怨的忍耐心，雖一時爲人責駡交併，亦不畏懼，在此塲合，尤應以政冶上的建樹，消減責駡。政治上有了是非，責駡者自然也有是非，自然由責駡而變爲擁護了。</p>
<p>淸時局情勢的演變，促成大東亞建設，尤其中日兩國合作之基。</p>
<p>有打破現狀的勇氣。維持現狀是消極的行動，打破現狀才是積極的行動。今日的政治環境不進則退，如以維持現狀爲滿足，則現狀也必維持不下。譬如汪主席在盟邦養病期間，對於政治上不應以維持現狀爲滿足，而應與盟邦當局坦白協商，衝破一切惡環境，以政治建設安定民心，以經濟建設協力大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>以身作則，鑒定信念，領盔甲全民爭取大東亞戰爭的最後勝利。</p>
<p>我們始終認爲國民政府不够强化，其原因：第一，中樞雖不乏政治經騐豐富的賢明領袖，但打破現狀的勇氣還嫌不够，政治必勝的信念還嫌不堅。第二，政府還都已　四年，代表人民要求的民意機關尙未成立，就是尙未充分把握人民心理。因此澆水上肥料剪枝等工作做得太少。同時，相反的工作，亦未以全力挑除。</p>
<p>德富翁說：「近年常講吃飽主義，本來人餓著肚皮是不能辦事的，如肚餓而不感覺其餓，這是臨時性的，一次二次固無問題，但如喪此以往，就不能戰爭下去。但吃飽也有兩種，一是肚皮的吃飽，一是精神的吃飽。」我們也同意非先使人民物質與精神够飽以後，不足以言協力戰爭。物質的吃飽，廣義的就就是民生安定，首要的就是民食，過去一年間，米統會辦理糧食，無論公米或民食，都是失敗的。今後，公米之緊要，民食之嚴重，國民政府應自動負起全責處理這一問題。退一步言，米統會經過改組後，縱不致重蹈覆轍，可是，我們總感覺，這樣重　要的民食問題，決不是這樣一個機構可以擔負起來的。所以，我們認為民食安定，並不是米統會及他人的責任，而始終是國民政府的責任，將來無可推諉的。</p>
<p>人民固然希望吃得適當的飽，可是，我們更希望政府應先使公務人員及保護人民安全的軍警先吃得飽。如果他們吃不飽，那末，人民就休想吃飽，這又是政府的責任。</p>
<h3>日潛艇巧妙作戰　勇猛突襲敵艦羣　在馬利亞納海面攻擊戰紀</h3>
<p>南方日軍基地二十八日中央社電　六月十一日小戰艦三艘，進攻大宮時島時，被日潛艇擊沉一艘，十九，二十日發現敵航空母艦二艘，三十日在塞班島東方三萬米地點擊沉其航空母艦一艘，七月二十日在塞班岛于果方七十六里附近，日潛水艇施放魚雷，襲繫敵艦五艘，日潛水艇在水平綫下約間隔三十分鐘，聞及兩次大爆炸聲嚮，並在潛望鏡內，發現敵軍艦之火光，襲擊此五艘敵艦之日潛艇，有未歸還者，然於六月十六臼曾四度猛襲敵戰艦羣及母艦羣，突入其輸型陣，日潛艇以巧妙戰術躲避敵軍轟擊，此可證明日海軍戰術進步之一斑，以下爲在馬里亞納海面攻擊敵航空母艦時之戰紀。</p>
<p>六月十一日，敵空襲塞班，日潛水艇隊及散出擊滅敵艦隊之</p>
<h3>飛電潛艇</h3>
<p>均布置於各海面，曾發現敵機及機動部隊達四次，其後臼潛艇之聲音員，發現右六十度之敵艦聲波，然因敵艦盲射炸彈，潛望鏡不能上舉，唯有注意其聲波，當艦長發出魚雷準備之口令時，敵艦羣似不斷於射炸彈，艇潛不能浮上，其後，敵音波次第淸晰，知已靠近，艦長乃高舉潛望鏡，即時發覺敵巡艦二艘，戰艦羣跟隨其後，係以巡艦三艘，騙艦十艘組成之輸型陣，於此千載難逢之良機，艦長急下突擊命令，是時，敵艦已變更角度，戰艦羣向西遁去後，忽然又發見航空母艦羣，構成</p>
<h3>一輪型陣</h3>
<p>其中有大型航空母艦二艘，由巡洋艦改裝之航空母艦一艘，巡洋艦二艘及騙逐艦十艘，但因距離較遠，故未能　行發動第二次攻擊，惟當時已有無　敵機飛翔空中，故潛艇不能浮上水而從事追擊。同時，敵騙逐艦亦曾三次通過潛艇之頭上，惟迭次危機均經突破，當逃避敵騙逐艦之攻擊時，在西方又三次發現大型航空母艦二艘，由巡洋艦改裝而成之航空母艦二艘，騙逐艦十艘圍護之，航空母艦羣亦因距離過遠，未能從事襲擊。在夕陽行將降落時，又第四次發現敵</p>
<h3>以潛望鏡</h3>
<p>觀之，即發見以大型航空母艦二艘（由巡洋艦改裝而成者）爲主幹之航空母艦羣，於黃昏時集中馬利亞納海面，當時，日潛艇適在此等敵艦之前警戒，敵航空母艦羣配備極其壯偉，以大型艦二艘配備於其前，改裝航空母艦配置於後，更在其前後分別配備巡洋艦各一艘，當時忽降暴雨，於是日潛艇之突擊路遂告展開，下午五時許，有一怪雷，使敵艦震動，將潛望鏡探照敵艦時，可望見防空砲火，同時，臼友軍機正在來攻，敵艦亦行反擊日機之際，日潛艇之秘匿企圖，乃得完全成功。另有敵大型艦二艘，計</p>
<h3>二萬噸級</h3>
<p>該艦在中央日舷艦橋權頭安置有電器探射燈，而在電器探射燈之後，豎有笨重之烟突，敵機則滿布於飛行甲板之上，當時敵艦已走人潛艇攻擊範國內，日潛艇長當即以潛望鏡探望，同時，日潛艇更從敵巡艦左右二百米，距巡艦左邊騙逐艦大百米之區域通過後，當將魚雷向之發射，時已六時七分，潛艇非作洋度之潛航不可，常時，海水曾鼓動，劇烈之聲音進入水槽，故潛艇惟有以急角度潛航，並以</p>
<h3>遂川贛州機塲　遭日機夜襲　各種設施完全粉碎</h3>
<p>日軍前錢茶基地二十八日中央社電　日本航空部隊，於二十五日夜急襲遂川·贛州·兩機塲，目熾烈之防空砲火，作正確之轟炸，將彈投於機塲滑走路，及其他各稱設施，全被粉碎，完成任務後安返。按該兩機塲以攙川·贛州·爲中心，以新城·南雄·吉安·建昌等機馬爲衛星，基地位於日軍佔領下之武漢與廣東地區中間，爲轟炸華巾華南各地之絕好位置。此次湖南作戰開始前，竹爲桂林飛行塲羣之推進基地，或充爲B24刑市繼基地，大事擴張中。但經日軍大作戰之推進後，漸受威脅，已決心放棄。但入八月後，認爲乃對日反攻有力據點，攙再度開始整備，經日軍此次夜襲，，巳完全被粉碎。</p>
<h3>魚雷衝擊</h3>
<p>敵艦三次。旋有敵騙逐艦三艘，在日潛艇所在地放射爆雷，當時艇身震動，歷三小時之久，海水遂從各方灌水槽，油　之油亦流進艇內，惟日潛艇仍繼續努力作死命之鬥爭，其後卒於夜半在馬利亞納海面浮上。</p>
<h3>日政治戰爭　已獲勝利　美國雜誌揭載</h3>
<p>東京二十八日中央社電　美國有識者，對大東亞戰戰爭政治思想之失敗與論已漸抬頭，美利堅商業雜誌，頃發表「日本之政治戰爭已獲勝利」頗為多方注視，該論文之含　爭，實為大東亞各國各民族謀求自由與獨立之先聲，同時亦為亞細亞民族革命之發展。　臼本宣言此次戰爭為亞洲民族擺脫歐美侵略之戰，而英美則號爲征對侵略亞洲者日本之十字軍，故問題富在亞洲民族對此兩則宣言之認識，但有色人種必反對英美之宣傳，而確信日本實爲自求解放者。　日本以武力爲背景，推進政治，經濟，財政各政策，積極協力亞洲各民族，而英美則漢視此種實現，乃不放棄以往野心，今後美國靑年從事此無謂之戰爭，涉足於密林戰及特殊之疾病地帶，將感無限苦惱也。由是亞細亞之政治戰爭，英美已遭失敗矣。</p>
<h3>日軍主力西移　勢將進攻桂林　渝美軍已失卻連絡</h3>
<p>里斯木二十八日中央社電　據紐約寨晤士報重慶特派員訊，湖南戰局如次：日軍放棄中國東部作戰，於重慶方面尙未見何種象徵。日軍現正於渝美空軍第十四航空隊之妨碍轟炸下，條築長沙以南之各道路，並有主力由湘江柬側移向西側，進擊桂林柳州之勢。如日本繼續向南進擊，除粵漢綫之外，並可將渝美空軍團於南方，減少其攻擊力。如自此點檢討美軍於中國上陸作戰計劃時，可知其於登陸時，其海軍與陸軍部隊不能利用接近地點之航空基地，同時又不能得重慶正規軍之援助。蓋以現勢觀之，美軍期待重慶之援助，實不能希望過大。又關於中國東南方面之局勢，亦頗微妙，蓋日軍於廣東持有强大之兵力，沿粵漢綫北上者，僅其二部，故至今粵漢綫仍未能攻下。又自七月開始之日軍攻勢，於日軍方面乃係最重要之作戰，蓋此作戰如能將重慶一切軍事力量，皆阻塞於雲南四川等西部各省時，日軍今後於中國東部之防禦，可以減輕負担也。</p>
<p>廣州二十八日中央社電　據重慶中央社電稱，渝軍事委員會，發表湖南浙江廣東方面戰况如次：　衡陽地誠於二十六二十七兩日，繼續戰鬥，由湘鄕西南方進攻之日軍，二十六日進入永　東方，刻正與渝軍激戰。　浙江方面，臼軍有力部隊，終於二十六日進抵武義南方十七公里之地點。　廣東方面，雷州半島廉江等地，正展開激烈巷戰。</p>
<p>中央社訊　重慶電，於日軍進攻長沙時，該市守備軍司令官第四軍長張德能，因失守岳麓山要塞陣地，致長沙市因之陷落。事後，經軍法執行處調查審理給果，已被判處死刑。於二十五日執行槍決云。</p>
<h3>被俘團長答記者問</h3>
<p>衡陽二十八日中央社電　「訓練重於作戰」衡陽城壁上之標語，已被雨濕而模糊。訓練精熟之衡陽守備軍第十師，的確頗爲强悍，然終於彈盡糧絕時，全軍自動停戰，其予渝方之打擊頗大。記者於二十一日往訪城內俘虜收容所，該收容所俘　四千餘名，記者並與第二十六國長曹京，二十九團畏朱光其，三十團畏陳德陛，及營長以上等四十餘名會談，更對各問題作回答如次：問·現在唯一希望如何？答·第一希望對受傷者　以治療，第二希望予吾等以食糧，他如娛樂安慰均不要。問·且下日軍將士尙無後方補給，汝等恢復過去團體組織，集團割稻以爲補給如何？答·甚佳，如是則强化團體組織，作各種準備，希望使吾等担任食糧補給。問·對日本所發傳單作何感想？答·繼續抗戰，益盛無一益，吾等過去僅以日軍爲敵，殊不知蠶食中國者乃美國。問·最後報紙何時看到？答。日軍入衡陽後始罷讀。問·汝等可知京漢綫之打通乎？關於華北之消息完全不知，關於粵漢綫時時有消息，故極爲淸楚。問·政治指導員所做何事？答·敎育文盲，担任勤勞奉公隊之組織。問·未作何種宣傳乎？作何種抗日宣傳？答·過去對文盲僅作口頭宣傳，對抗戰意志薄弱者所施唯一手段即標語，最常用者「抗戰救國，」「艱苦奮鬥，」「抗戰必勝，」「抗戰建國。」問·此等宣傳由何處指示？答·由軍事委員會政治部，以公文或小册子交由軍部傳達。問·目下心境如何？答·目下吾等一團中未負傷者僅百各，內外經四十餘日之激戰後，得睹束亞和平，頗感光榮，然吾等立塲，現已充滿苦惱，故能理解吾等之苦惱時，則</p>
<h3>緬甸反軸心軍　損失重大</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十八日中央社電　據倫敦電，東南亞洲反軸心軍司令官蒙特巴頓，前爲與英軍首　協議，曾赴倫敦，最近已返印度防地。其在倫敦時，曾與新聞記者團談稱：緬甸戰綫全長七百英里，僅次於東綫，按緬甸實爲日軍戰略上必須防衛之地，在反軸心方面，亦爲獲得向重慶輸血路所必爭之地。此戰錢上，我方損失頗大，木年以來陣亡約一萬，失踪三千，患　疾者達二十五萬之衆。</p>
<h3>德新聞社論　日生產前途</h3>
<p>柏林二十八日中央社電　德國新聞社頃論　日本戰時生產之前途如次：日本新內閣重要任務之一：即爲增强軍需生產，此事之實現可能甚大。苦自種種方面觀察，日木現在尙未能完全使用其工業力，其前途之困難絕非不能除去，是以日太之增强軍需生產，問題本非重大，要在充分利用現有之營力，資源，機械等，作　當而決斷之整頓。日本戰時生產有提高可能之根據，即日本之經濟較短期間，即由經工業進至重工業，此種大規模之轉換，欲發展至完全顯現其效　，必須經過相當時日，　未達到極點，將來仍有下可限量之途。</p>
<h3>日遠藤中等　建空中戰績　墜毀美機創空前紀錄</h3>
<p>日軍某基地二十八臼中央社電　美軍誇稱不落之空軍要塞B29型飛機，於本月二十日傍晚第四次空襲日本北九州時，日海上飛機亦曾參戰，其中有遠藤中尉，尾崎中士所驚之一單翼機，竟建樹擊洛B29架，擊毀六架之空前紀錄。據某基地報吿還膝機空戰紀實如次，是日下午二時十六分，突從長崎縣某島西北三十英里某茶海面之斜陽中，出現敵機編隊五架，遠藤機衝入敵編隊對之射擊，敵機第一架及第三架受創離開編隊，遠藤中尉決心將此二織擊落，乃立即向第一架猛烈射擊，該機左　　處中彈，冒出黑烟，　首下垂，墜入海中。遠正中尉後向第三架射擊，　　右翼根處亦中彈，冒出黑烟，立時下墜，兩機　　洛時，僅距發現時間九分鐘。第一次空戰後十二分鐘，又遭遇敵機三架在前兩架在後之編隊，於是遠藤中尉決定攻擊其中之一架，立即作準備射擊，敵機翼遂上下搖動，漸漸下落，該機經日陸軍之新司偵機探察，確認擊落。旋於下午六時，發現敵機二架以全速力逃逸，於是遠藤中　機，自上方準　，敵機第一架尾部中彈，　二架翼亦中彈，兩機同時下墜，斯時遠藤中尉雖欲追擊，無奈彈已用盡。</p>

<p>馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　菲律賓保健勞動厚生部，決定組織厚生委員會，由菲醫學界權威印天旅博士以次六名任委員，該會除調查厚生問題外，並統轄指導各厚生團體。</p>
<p>馬尼刺二十八日中央社電　菲政府爲迅速促進馬尼刺市人口疏散，特公布大總統令，自二十五日起，所有向該市旅行者，一律加以限制，該命令除持有必需物資輸入之許可者，醫師及公務員外，均禁止旅行該市，違反者處千比索之罰金成六月以上之勞役。又市民疏散委員會最近於第一次會議中，關於强化疏散人口交換意見，決定將居住馬尼刺之外地人遣送歸鄕，同時不必要之職業介紹者之集合所，特殊旅館等加以閉鎖，他如小學校，娛樂塲所等之疏散事項，亦積極實施之。</p>

<p>美總統維斯福親赴夏威夷，召集陸海軍將領舉行對日軍事會議，就奪回菲島作戰之迅急的進展，有所指示。有謂其時機　在九月上旬。美軍當局在尙未完全議定馬利亞納羣島之先，何以那麼性急的欲强行對日作戰呢？可就下面諸點加以者察：</p>
<h3>羅斯福謀博取人心</h3>
<p>第一，這是羅斯福在本年秋季大選時企圖四屆連任的傳取人心的政策。戰時下的美國政廚，是否尙信奉民主主義，爲自由的樂土，雖有種重反證可舉，但至少總統選舉係採用由人民投票決定的形式，民衆的支持是絕對必要的。然美國政府現為應付龐大的軍需要求，總動員人與物的資源，因生活的困難與死傷數的增大，民心對政府的動向，未必良好。軍需關係工廠的罷工迭起，與物價的昂騰，就說明了這種情形。所以羅斯福在今秋的大選中如欲四選，至少須獲得足以反攻這國民氣運的大戰果，消滅國民的不滿，同時，由戰勝使轉變其反感。羅斯福在這裏無論如何須設法消減戰時下國民的不平，急欲向國民展開大攻勢。</p>
<h3>日本戰力與時俱增</h3>
<p>第二，日本的戰力，卻與時俱增。大東亞戰爭前，軍需工業上最重要的石油，錫，橡膠等和生產，日本極少，在進行戰爭上，視為相當困難，但自奠定了蘇門答臘，馬來，爪哇，西里伯等地以後，已能保持充分的供給，美國則因錫·橡膠的世界主耍產地被日木占領的結果，其補給陷於困難，在橡膠製品上，殆全係重製品或代用品，此已由最近在日本內地被擊落的美國製B二九型轟炸機所證明。</p>
<p>尤以瘧疾的特效樂奎賓，爲南洋羣島的特產品，大東亞戰爭以癒疾地帶南洋爲中心而展開迄至現在，美國因不能獲得奎寗，致病死者纍　，而叫苦連天。</p>
<p>至於錫，雖開發了南美玻琍維亞的鑛山，但均爲品質悲劣的代用品，在製造軍需用高速度鋼材上，有重大缺點。所以戰爭遲一天，美國的戰力就愈削弱，反之，日本的戰力就　增加。</p>
<h3>美國人的厭戰氣氛</h3>
<p>第三，美國人壓戰氣氛逐漸濃厚的事實，不能忽視。戰爭所致的影響，全世界各國人民同樣都不信為是可喜的現象，况美國尙因民需比例物資的不足，食糧品的减產，而逐漸窮困。且惡性通貨膨脹所致物價昻騰，購買力的上昇，更助長此傾向，故美國人民的生活問題，今將達爆裂點。加以戰局的進展不順利，徒增死塲，而所獲戰果，則僅太平洋上彈丸般的島嶼，奪回菲島，登陸中國大陸，日木本土攻防戰，與戰爭攙行上意新巾的諸作戰，尙須犧牲龐大的人的物的資源；反之，戰爭的目的，又不足以鼓舞神聖的人類愛，淸高的國民愛，不過為了　是羅斯福個人的世界又配慾，並一部份資本家的利益追求慾，這種種悄形，都助長了一般國民的厭戰氣氛</p>
<p>所以，如欲早一日結束戰爭，而要使一個兵士在戰塲上活躍，就得要國內十七個勞慟者，導重性質的近代戰爭之遂行是不可能的，因而美國在希冀戰局的迅速進展。</p>
<p>反之，日本則揭起了解放大東亞彼壓迫民族的旗幟，以建設大東亞新秩序爲目的的東亞十億人民，一致團結，以期貫澈戰爭目的，而可懼的戰力，正在養成中。</p>
<h3>美國企圖妨礙日本</h3>
<p>由以上諸點可以明瞭，決戰期愈拖長，在戰力上日本愈立在有利的立塲。所以對於日本因大東亞戰爭的勝利，而保持的南方諸地域戰爭資源，移在日本本土增强戰力化的事實，美國現正焦急的企圖破壞。</p>
<p>一，由於太平洋方面海上　動部隊之猛攻，竟欲迫近菲島，中國大陸方面，遮斷南方聯絡綫。</p>
<p>二，由於對中國大陸及揚子江上船舶的攻擊，企圖遮斷海上交通路綫。</p>
<p>三，由於中國大陸空戰的激化，以支援渝軍　確保對日航空基地，一面並欲强化從陸地的壓迫。</p>
<p>四，由於破壞日本本土的重工業地區，以减低軍需生產力。</p>
<p>對此，日本在馬利亞納羣島邀繫美大軍，「漸减作戰」獲得成功，一面並將菲島，台灣，日木本士及中國大陸要塞化，蓄積戰力，整備邀擊熊勢，嚴陣以待敵美軍的來襲。例如，木月二十日，對侵攻九州及中國西部地方的駐渝美空軍約八十架——據美國通訊社稱爲亞洲航空史上空前的最大攻擊——使敵企圖完全無效，擊落盲炸的敵機二十三架。尤以向敵機二架猛衝，一舉將其擊落的日木防空戰士之鬥魂，雖美人亦爲之乍舌，稱「日本航空部隊的政擊，意外的有效」，暗示侵襲日本本土的因難</p>
<h3>日本占得天時地理</h3>
<p>在時間問題上，已得天利，並占得自然地利的日木，在中日及大東亞全體民族的眞正團結下，最高度地增强其戰力中。——據傳現在日本飛機的製造力，爲世界第二位，則在太平洋的飛機數，日本當然是第一位。——有恃無恐的今後戰略態勢，袛因保守沈默，故確信必將擊减來犯的敵軍。</p>

<h3>改善監獄衛生芻議</h3>
<p>— 袁叡昌</p>
<p>晚近世界各國，對於因罪嫌而繫囹圄之囚犯，除施以感化敎育外，於監犯衛生設施，亦頗重視，良以監犯衛生之良竄，能影響囚犯之健康，或謂改善監販衛生待遇無殊獎勵犯罪，此實大謬不然，蓋自由刑之要旨厥在剝奪或限制犯罪者之百由，自不可傷書其身體與生命者也。凡人因獲罪入獄，固爲應得之結果，第入獄後盒不足以養生，衣不足以禦寒，是非人道所許可，若因此而患病而殘廢而死亡，則不啻於自由刑外復加以身體刑及生命刑，更非其所應受，故國際刑罰委員會有監獄待遇人犯　低限度之規定，以冀罪犯待遇之改良，其細目以衣·食·住·勞役。及醫藥等問題為最重要，同時注意感化教育，使其能悔過自新，復歸社會而成為善良有用之人民。益有進者，監獄爲剝奪自由人之集團，最易發生各種傳人疾病，訓至影響公共衛生。故爲維讓人道，保障社曾健康計，對於監獄衛生之改善，自屬刻不容綏。司法行政部張故部長對此尤爲重視，因是巡視外獄而傳染斑疹傷寒致死，可見監獄忽於衛生因而權傳染病死去，事頗易易，洵可懷焉，本人黍長木市衛生，爰不揣　陋，草此蜀議，社會先進不吝指敎，尤爲感幸。</p>
<p>改善計劃</p>
<p>甲，關於環境衛生方面</p>
<p>所調環境衛生者包括建築物及一切換氣，光綫，暖室，氣積，防火設備並監獄建築物之佈置，如監房工塲炊塲浴室病監及坑厠溝渠等均須縝密計劃，充份設施。室內外須每日打掃，間日洗刷，每室備有痰盂，禁止隨地吐痰，溜渠時常冲通，坑國應遂日洒以臭藥水，務使保持永久淸潔。</p>
<p>乙·關於飲食方面</p>
<p>飲食所以營養全身體質，發生全身體溫及體力，補充消耗成份，實爲生活之要素。飲食不足固有碍營養，但食料配合失宜，或失於　調，或食巳經腐敗之食物，仍非養生之遭，甚或發生營養缺乏病及感染疾病因而致死者，故監獄對於在監人犯飲食之處理，甚爲重視，務求質蚤均能適合養生必要之條件，大抵每人每日至少需米或雜糧（如小米玉蜀黍粉及高梁等）七合，靑菜黃豆每人每日至少須各四兩，魚或肉每人每星期二兩。至於食物用具，尤宜採取不碍衛生免易養化生毒，普通人犯與病犯之餐具，應以顏色或形式上不同義分別使用及處置，患有肺結核及傳染病囚犯之餐具，每次用後尤應嚴予消毒，以防傳染。</p>
<p>丙，關係衣被方面</p>
<p>衣被乃爲調節體溫，防禦寒襲，爲維持監獄衛生計，囚犯之衣被應由公家供給，每人單衣　兩套，棉衣袴一套。其　被爲便利洗滌及隨無候寒暖加减計，每人須備棉毯四條，並須時當洗滌換晒免生蚤蚤及傳染疾病。患病者及病故囚犯之衣被，須施行消毒手續。凡新犯入獄，經沐浴後，須更換備之衣被立即消毒收存，以免携帶病菌入獄。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　對本市電車公司當局的獻議</h3>
<p>— 春風</p>
<p>自電車公司遵奉當局節電意旨調整路綫减少軍輛以來，各界市民之「行」的問題，頗受影響，但看每日上工下工時間各大起站終站乘客列隊之綿長，及每一搭客焦急懊喪之神情，即可瞭然。若不意發生警戎，或陣雨驟至。在秩序與安寧方面，尤蒙不良影響　然節電旣爲巳定方策，惟有在技術上謀求適當之改善，務求公可方面無任何不便與損失，而市民則感受其利，竊願貢獻下列改善之策：</p>
<p>修改車時間</p>
<p>現定開車時問與車輛支配，原已較以前改良不少，如在上下工時間之　輛較多等。但按諸實際，尙不足以供應需要。故希望迅加澈底改訂，即參酌政府各機關民間各團體及主耍生產事業公司廠商之上下工時間，仿照火車班次行駛辦法，每日規定開車次數，即上午七時至九時（假定，以下同）中午十二時至二時，下午五時至七時，爲固定開駛時間，原有規定行駛之車輛，在此時間內一齊行駷，在此時間以外，即全部停馳。如此，在乘客方面，因有定時，在此時間行駛之車輛旣多，往復次數增多，則可不必久等，精神勞力大可節約，對於公務及業務可不致受影響，而電軍公司方面，亦可合理調節其車睡，人員及事務，相信在業務效率上亦（必可收極大效益。至於停止行爲一般股有民，波等本可改乘人力軍三輛　或步行，此種新辦法實施後，本市交通秩序赤必可爲之改觀。</p>
<p>改正通車路綫</p>
<p>目前一區電車行駛路錢，雖爲迭經者慮修正之結果，似乎無可疵議。然過去去之老慮乃依據舊有行軍時間而定者，若上項獻議已蒙採取，則爲便利各界實際需要起見，若千必耍而無其他代替東輛行駛之舊有路綫，似宜早予恢復。其間更迫切需要者厥爲五路三路及一路十二路之長程通車路錢。按五路之恢復，與上海市外交通有關，便利於北站旅客及小件貨運者殊鉅；而三路及十二路則更直接與戰時生產事業有密切關係，至於恢復長途通重，則因自通車停駛以來，乘客至中站（如南京路外灘）必須再經排隊候車，往往自起點，經換車站，所費時間與精神，不可言喻，影響於政治文化及產業人員之工作效率者極大，反之，電軍公司方面則未見因停駛長途而收任何便利。至於恢復長途通車後之售票，則可自起站買長途票，如可節省印刷等費計，則可令購二張票亦無不便</p>
<p>關於車費問題</p>
<p>（甲）軍費增加問題：按諸目前物價，及各種車輛收費現况，一區電車收費之廉，有口皆碑，按之情理，增價亦頗合理。惟當局爲保特旣定政策，避免軍費刺激物價，亦可令人感激，且公用事業，受當局管理與補助，原不）必與一般私營機關競利。鄙意則以爲現有車費有使公司過於虧損，亦屍事實，而無賴乞丐混入車輛化乞，更屬可惡。故酌量增加亦無不可。惟增加時須為五元十元之整數，否則非乘客之損失即公司之損失也。</p>
<p>（乙）揩油問題：受損失者或爲公司，或爲乖客。公司方面，以車上賣票員之揩汕爲主，乘客方面，以各站售票亭售票員之扣留找頭爲主。至其原因，以員工薪給不足維持生活為主，而陋習相傳，防制不得其法，亦爲主要原因之一。故今後可採取下列辦法：　票價劃一爲五元或十元，便於找付；　完全廢止車上售票，每軍一輛只留開車一名，助手一人，兩節者加助手人，開車兼司前　門開閉，助手只司後車門及拖車門開閉及其他協助開車事務，兩者均不得顧問車票。　東票一律於上車前預購，上車則另派人在車門檢查。　下軍時概須收票，無者倍罰。　以前積票五十張兌換獎券，不合國人「面十」觀念，可以取悄。如上述仃車時間更定後公司人員不虞不足。</p>
<p>肅振交通秩序</p>
<p>近半年來，因當局及公司方面之認眞改善，已見好轉，但自减少車輛以米，情形巳見惡化。今後如依上述三種新辦法，則父通秩序，必可再見好現象，惟在通車時間，乘客勢必擁擠　恒，故可採分段排隊辦法，那在車站附近　接近之空地，多設售票亭，每個最少二亭，每三等二隊。超過一定人數即另排一段。如此則可免妨礙一般交通而減少排隊乘客之痛苦與危險，並保障車站之安靜整肅。惟每隊必派交通維特員二人以上，務必穿着制服，標明第號，除對於軍警人員及孕婦有顯明表示者外，不得放任何人越位爭前，如有徇情及不負責矯正者，允許其他乘客告發。其乘客有自讓他人　入隊列者，電車交通維持員得令其一倂出他。</p>
<h3>宿願（九）海軍</h3>
<p>— 洪洋譯</p>
<p>第二天上午十時左右，勝夫在　個關下了電東，一直走上海軍省。對於這個明浛時代磚瓦所建造起來的樓房，在軍車上國然曾眺望過，但脚踏進院落，這還是第一次。心中想，院內一定立着家鄕海軍老前輩的鋼像，但並無心去尋找。</p>
<p>在大門前，躊躇徘徊好久，正要入內的時候，守衛就打聽來意了。</p>
<p>「旣然是那樣事情，就向那邊轉吧！」</p>
<p>按照方向走去，傍面有一問不甚亮的傳達室。在窗口說明來意後，　歐就默默地拿出一張紙頭來。</p>
<p>隆夫用鉛筆按照訪問人名，來訪人名，事由，有無前約等綢一一塡上。交給辦事人員後，他心中就起了很大的不安。飛田中校那樣忙碌的人，會給我會面麼？再說，能記得我的名字麽？</p>
<p>但等了片刻，又出現的僕歐，簡單明瞭地說</p>
<p>「請到這要來！」</p>
<p>走上古老而暗淡的台階，到了二樓走廊時，　歐說了一聲「就在那邊」，而就回去了。</p>
<p>前面灰門很緊地關閉着。隆夫有點慌張地佇立了一會兒。因爲這是海軍省。假如隨便一開門，是一個大禮堂，那豈不是要發　麽？</p>
<p>然而恰好，從裘面出來了一個人。未穿着西裝上身的人，出來了。</p>
<p>「此處是報這部麽？」</p>
<p>「呵，是的。」</p>
<p>隆夫才放心進去了。桌子整齊排列的房簡裏。有很多人在辦公，同時電話的聲音在　。大家都在忙，所以傳達和招待的人是沒有的。</p>
<p>但在裏面的棹前坐着的一位無須的軍人，突然抬起頭來，看見隆夫就用手打招呼。呵，那副面孔，想起來了。</p>
<p>「您是飛田先生麽？」</p>
<p>爲了不致錯誤，隆夫就問了一聲。</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>中校讀了一半投遞來的眞人介紹信，就對着隆夫說：</p>
<p>「關於你的事，少尉曾講過了。你的畫，我也曾在海國展裹看過了。……請寫一份覆歷書夾！不要把現住所忘記寫上。還有送一張二寸半身像片來……」</p>
<p>眉目濟秀的飛田中校，發着與面孔不相襯的聲音，就起身了。而會時間，僅僅三分鐘。（一三六）</p>

<h3>On the Certainty of Political Victory</h3>
<p>— Chen Bin-su</p>
<p>On the 27th of this month, this newspaper's "Weekly Commentary" published an article by Duke Tokutomi titled "Politics of Certain Victory." I deeply feel that Duke Tokutomi's arguments are quite similar to what we have been discussing, and are worthy of reference for the people of our country, especially those in power. Today, we have specially chosen the topic "On the Certainty of Political Victory," which means: "If politics are handled well, victory can be achieved," and also means: "Only by handling politics well can victory be achieved."</p>
<p>Duke Tokutomi said: "Today's politicians, if they do not investigate the needs of the people, this is a great and utter mistake. Politicians who grasp the needs of flowers and trees should water them when they need watering, fertilize them when they need fertilizing, prune them when they need pruning, and weed them when they need weeding. Similarly, just as a doctor understands the needs of a patient, only then can one appreciate the true essence of politics. In politics, there is a definite rule that one must thoroughly investigate the psychology of the people, and one must act according to the rules. If one does not understand the psychology of flowers and trees and still waters them on rainy days, then the flowers and trees are in danger of being waterlogged. This is because the relationship of politics has not been considered. This is essential for a large country or a small city or town. "This passage fully explains the duties that politicians should have. In China's current situation, we especially need great politicians, who need to win the hearts of the people, grasp the needs of the people, and do the work of watering, fertilizing, and pruning. Based on this need, today's Chinese politicians must possess the following conditions:</p>
<p>Be able to plan for the revival of the nation and the people, with a near-term plan of ten years and a long-term plan of fifty to one hundred years.</p>
<p>Have the patience to endure hardship and criticism, and not be afraid of being blamed or scolded for a time. In this situation, one should especially use political achievements to reduce criticism. Once there is right and wrong in politics, those who criticize will naturally also have right and wrong, and will naturally change from criticizing to supporting.</p>
<p>Clearly understand the evolution of the current situation and promote the construction of Greater East Asia, especially the basis for cooperation between China and Japan.</p>
<p>Have the courage to break the status quo. Maintaining the status quo is a passive action, while breaking the status quo is an active action. Today's political environment is one where if you do not advance, you retreat. If you are satisfied with maintaining the status quo, then the status quo will inevitably be unsustainable. For example, during Chairman Wang's convalescence in an allied country, he should not have been satisfied with maintaining the status quo in politics, but should have frankly negotiated with the allied authorities, broken through all adverse environments, stabilized the people's hearts with political construction, and cooperated in the Greater East Asia War with economic construction.</p>
<p>Lead by example, establish faith, and lead the whole people to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>We have always believed that the National Government is not strong enough, and the reasons are: First, although the central government does not lack wise leaders with rich political experience, their courage to break the status quo is still insufficient, and their belief in the certainty of political victory is not strong enough. Second, the government has returned to the capital for four years, but the people's representative body representing the people's demands has not yet been established, which means that the psychology of the people has not yet been fully grasped. Therefore, too little work has been done in watering, fertilizing, and pruning. At the same time, the opposite work has not been carried out with full force.</p>
<p>Duke Tokutomi said: "In recent years, we often talk about the doctrine of being well-fed. Originally, people cannot work on an empty stomach. If they are hungry but do not feel hungry, this is temporary. It is not a problem once or twice, but if this continues, the war cannot be fought. But there are also two kinds of being well-fed, one is being well-fed in the stomach, and the other is being well-fed in spirit." We also agree that unless the people are materially and spiritually well-fed first, it is not enough to talk about cooperating in the war. Materially well-fed, in a broad sense, is the stability of people's livelihood, and the most important thing is the people's food. In the past year, the Rice Control Association's handling of food, whether public rice or people's food, has been a failure. In the future, the National Government should automatically take full responsibility for handling this issue, given the urgency of public rice and the seriousness of people's food. To take a step back, even if the Rice Control Association does not repeat its mistakes after reorganization, we still feel that such an important issue of people's food cannot be shouldered by such an organization. Therefore, we believe that the stability of people's food is not the responsibility of the Rice Control Association and others, but has always been the responsibility of the National Government, and there will be no excuse in the future.</p>
<p>The people certainly hope to eat adequately, but we also hope that the government should first ensure that civil servants and the military police who protect the safety of the people are well-fed. If they are not well-fed, then the people should not even think about being well-fed, and this is also the government's responsibility.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine's Skillful Operation: Brave Assault on Enemy Fleet - A Record of Attack in the Mariana Sea</h3>
<p>Southern Japanese Army Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: On June 11th, three small warships attacking Omiya Island were sunk by Japanese submarines. On the 19th and 20th, two enemy aircraft carriers were discovered. On the 30th, one of their aircraft carriers was sunk 30,000 meters east of Saipan Island. On July 20th, near 76 miles off the coast of Saipan Island, Japanese submarines launched torpedoes, attacking five enemy ships. Japanese submarines, submerged below the waterline, heard two loud explosion sounds approximately thirty minutes apart and observed the flames of enemy warships in the periscope. The Japanese submarines that attacked these five enemy ships have not yet returned. However, on June 16th, they fiercely attacked enemy battleship fleets and carrier fleets four times, breaking into their convoy formation. The Japanese submarines skillfully evaded enemy bombing. This can prove a glimpse of the progress of the Japanese naval tactics. The following is a record of the attack on enemy aircraft carriers in the Mariana Sea.</p>
<p>On June 11th, when the enemy attacked Saipan by air, Japanese submarine teams were dispatched to attack and destroy the enemy fleet.</p>
<h3>Flying Electric Submarine</h3>
<p>All were deployed on various sea surfaces, and enemy aircraft and mobile units were detected four times. Afterwards, the submarine's sonar operator detected enemy warship sonar waves at 60 degrees to the right. However, because enemy warships blindly fired bombs, the periscope could not be raised. It was necessary to pay attention to the sonar waves. When the captain issued the order to prepare torpedoes, the enemy fleet seemed to be constantly firing bombs. The submarine could not surface. Afterwards, the enemy's sonar waves gradually became clearer, indicating that they were approaching. The captain raised the periscope and immediately discovered two enemy cruisers, followed by a battleship fleet consisting of three cruisers and ten escort ships. This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and the captain immediately issued an attack order. At this time, the enemy ships had changed their angle and the battleship fleet fled west. Afterwards, an aircraft carrier fleet was suddenly discovered, forming a</p>
<h3>Ring Formation</h3>
<p>Among them were two large aircraft carriers, one aircraft carrier converted from a cruiser, two cruisers, and ten escort destroyers. However, due to the long distance, it was not possible to launch a second attack. At that time, countless enemy aircraft were flying in the air, so the submarine could not surface to pursue. At the same time, enemy escort destroyers passed over the submarine's head three times. However, the successive crises were all overcome. While evading the attack of the enemy escort destroyers, two large aircraft carriers, two aircraft carriers converted from cruisers, and ten escort destroyers were discovered three times in the west, surrounding them. The aircraft carrier fleet was also too far away to launch an attack. As the setting sun was about to fall, the enemy was discovered for the fourth time.</p>
<h3>With Periscope</h3>
<p>Looking through it, it was discovered that the aircraft carrier fleet, with two large aircraft carriers (converted from cruisers) as the mainstays, was concentrated in the Mariana Sea at dusk. At that time, the Japanese submarine was on alert in front of these enemy ships. The enemy aircraft carrier fleet was equipped extremely magnificently, with two large ships equipped in front, converted aircraft carriers placed in the rear, and cruisers equipped in front and behind. At that time, a sudden heavy rain fell, and the Japanese submarine's attack route was launched. At about 5:00 p.m., there was a strange thunder that shook the enemy ship. When the periscope searched for the enemy ship, anti-aircraft artillery fire could be seen. At the same time, Japanese friendly aircraft were attacking, and the enemy ships were counterattacking Japanese aircraft. The Japanese submarine's secret attempt was completely successful. There were also two enemy large ships, estimated at</p>
<h3>20,000 Tons Class</h3>
<p>The ship had an electric searchlight installed on the bridge on the central side, and behind the electric searchlight was a bulky smokestack. Enemy aircraft were all over the flight deck. At that time, the enemy ship had entered the Japanese submarine's attack range, and the Japanese submarine captain immediately looked through the periscope. At the same time, the Japanese submarine passed through the area 200 meters to the left and right of the enemy cruiser, and 100 meters away from the escort destroyer on the left side of the cruiser. The torpedoes were then launched at 6:07 p.m. The submarine had to submerge at a sharp angle.</p>
<h3>Suichuan Ganzhou Airfield Raided by Japanese Aircraft at Night: All Facilities Completely Destroyed</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Frontline Tea Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese air force units raided the Suichuan and Ganzhou airfields on the night of the 25th. Amidst fierce anti-aircraft fire, they carried out accurate bombing, dropping bombs on the airfield runways and other facilities, which were all destroyed. These two airfields, centered on Suichuan and Ganzhou, with Xincheng, Nanxiong, Ji'an, and Jianchang airfields as satellites, were located in the middle of the Wuhan and Guangdong areas occupied by the Japanese army, an excellent position for bombing areas in central and southern China. Before the start of the Hunan campaign, it was used as an advance base for the Guilin airfield group or as a relay base for B-24 bombers, and was being greatly expanded. However, as the Japanese army's major campaign progressed, it gradually came under threat and a decision was made to abandon it. However, in August, it was considered a powerful stronghold for counterattacking Japan, and preparations were started again. However, after this night raid by the Japanese army, it has been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Torpedo Impact</h3>
<p>Enemy ships three times. Subsequently, three enemy escort destroyers fired depth charges at the location of the Japanese submarine. At that time, the hull of the submarine shook for three hours. Seawater flowed into the water tanks from all sides, and oil from the oil tanks also flowed into the submarine. However, the Japanese submarine continued to fight desperately, and finally surfaced in the Mariana Sea at midnight.</p>
<h3>Japan's Political Warfare Has Achieved Victory: American Magazine Reveals</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: Among knowledgeable people in the United States, discussions of the failure of the political ideology of the Greater East Asia War have gradually risen. "Japan's Political Warfare Has Achieved Victory," recently published in the American business magazine, is attracting much attention. The content of the article is actually a prelude to the pursuit of freedom and independence by the countries and ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, and is also a development of the Asian ethnic revolution. The Japanese declaration stated that this war was a war for Asian ethnic groups to break away from European and American aggression, while Britain and the United States called it a crusade against Japan, the aggressor of Asia. Therefore, the problem lies in the understanding of these two declarations by Asian ethnic groups. However, people of color will definitely oppose the propaganda of Britain and the United States and believe that Japan is truly seeking liberation. Japan is promoting political, economic, and financial policies with military force as its background, actively cooperating with various ethnic groups in Asia, while Britain and the United States turn a blind eye to this kind of realization and do not give up their past ambitions. In the future, American youth will engage in this meaningless war and set foot in dense forest battles and special disease zones, which will cause endless suffering. Therefore, in the Asian political war, Britain and the United States have already suffered defeat.</p>
<h3>Main Force of Japanese Army Moves Westward, Poised to Attack Guilin: US Military in Chongqing Has Lost Contact</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a dispatch from the New York Times correspondent in Chongqing, the Hunan war situation is as follows: The Japanese army has abandoned operations in eastern China, and no indication of this has been seen in the Chongqing area. The Japanese army is currently constructing roads south of Changsha under the harassing bombing of the U.S. Air Force's Fourteenth Air Force, and a major force is moving from the east side of the Xiang River to the west side, with the intention of attacking Guilin and Liuzhou. If Japan continues to advance southward, in addition to the Yuehan Line, it can also reduce the attacking power of the U.S. Air Force group in the south. When reviewing the U.S. military's landing operation plan in China from this point, it can be seen that when landing, its naval and army forces cannot use air bases in close proximity, and at the same time cannot obtain assistance from the regular army in Chongqing. Considering the current situation, the U.S. military's expectation of assistance from Chongqing is unrealistic. The situation in southeastern China is also quite delicate, as the Japanese army holds strong forces in Guangdong, and only a portion of them are moving north along the Yuehan Line. Therefore, the Yuehan Line has not yet been captured. The Japanese army's offensive, which began in July, is the most important operation for the Japanese army, because if this operation can block all military forces in Chongqing in the western provinces such as Yunnan and Sichuan, the Japanese army's defense in eastern China in the future can be reduced.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Chongqing Central News Agency dispatch, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission announced the war situation in Hunan, Zhejiang, and Guangdong as follows: In Hengyang, fierce battles continued on the 26th and 27th. The Japanese army advancing from the southwest of Xiangxiang entered the east of Yongfeng on the 26th and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Chongqing army. On the Zhejiang front, powerful Japanese troops finally reached a point 17 kilometers south of Wuyi on the 26th. On the Guangdong front, fierce street battles are unfolding in Lianjiang and other places on the Leizhou Peninsula.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch: Chongqing telegram: When the Japanese army attacked Changsha, Zhang Deneng, the commander of the Changsha garrison and the commander of the Fourth Army, was sentenced to death and executed by firing squad on the 25th for losing the Yue Lu Mountain fortress, which led to the fall of Changsha City, following an investigation and trial by the military law enforcement office.</p>
<h3>Captured Regiment Commander Answers Reporter's Questions</h3>
<p>Hengyang, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: "Training is more important than combat" - the slogan on the walls of Hengyang has been blurred by rain. The well-trained 10th Division of the Hengyang garrison was indeed quite powerful, but when their ammunition and food ran out, the entire army automatically ceased fighting, which dealt a great blow to the Chongqing side. On the 21st, the reporter visited the prisoner-of-war camp in the city, which held more than 4,000 prisoners. The reporter also held talks with Regiment Commander Cao Jing of the 26th Regiment, Regiment Commander Zhu Guangqi of the 29th Regiment, Regiment Commander Chen Debi of the 30th Regiment, and more than 40 officers above the battalion commander level, and answered questions as follows: Q: What is your only hope now? A: Our first hope is to treat the wounded, and our second hope is to give us food. We don't want other things like entertainment and comfort. Q: Since the Japanese soldiers and officers do not have rear supply, how about restoring your past organizational structure and collectively harvesting rice as a supply? A: That's great. If so, we will strengthen the organizational structure and make various preparations. We hope to be responsible for food supply. Q: What do you think of the leaflets issued by Japan? A: Continuing the war is not beneficial. In the past, we only regarded the Japanese army as the enemy, but we did not know that the United States was the one who gradually eroded China. Q: When was the last time you saw the newspaper? A: We stopped reading after the Japanese army entered Hengyang. Q: Do you know that the Beijing-Hankou Railway has been opened? We have no knowledge of news about North China, but we have clear news about the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. Q: What does the political instructor do? A: Educate illiterates and organize labor service teams. Q: What kind of propaganda have you not done? What kind of anti-Japanese propaganda have you done? A: In the past, we only carried out oral propaganda for the illiterates. The only means used for those with weak anti-war will was slogans. The most commonly used ones were "Resist Japan to save the country," "Struggle arduously," "Resistance will surely win," and "Resistance will build the country." Q: Where did this propaganda come from? A: It was conveyed by the Military Affairs Commission's Political Department to the military in the form of official documents or booklets. Q: What is your state of mind now? A: At present, there are only a hundred uninjured people in our regiment. After more than forty days of fierce fighting, we are honored to see the peaceful East Asia. However, our position is now full of distress, so when you can understand our distress, then...</p>
<h3>Significant Losses for Anti-Axis Forces in Burma</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London dispatch, Lord Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander in Southeast Asia, recently returned to his Indian defense area after going to London to discuss with British chiefs. While in London, he told a group of journalists: The Burmese front is 700 miles long, second only to the Eastern Front. Burma is a place that the Japanese army must strategically defend. On the anti-axis side, it is also a place that must be contested to obtain a supply route to Chongqing. Our side suffered significant losses on this front. Since this year, about 10,000 have died in battle, 3,000 are missing, and 250,000 are suffering from diseases.</p>
<h3>German News Agency Editorial: Prospects for Japanese Production</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: The German News Agency recently commented on the prospects for Japan's wartime production as follows: One of the important tasks of the new Japanese cabinet is to increase military production, and the realization of this matter is highly possible. Judging from various aspects, Japan has not yet fully utilized its industrial power, and the difficulties in the future are by no means insurmountable. Therefore, the problem of increasing military production in Japan is not a major one, but it is necessary to fully utilize existing strength, resources, and machinery, and to make appropriate and decisive adjustments. The basis for the possibility of improving wartime production in Japan is that the Japanese economy has advanced from light industry to heavy industry in a relatively short period of time. For this large-scale transformation to fully show its effectiveness, it must go through a considerable period of time, and before reaching its peak, there is still an unlimited path to come.</p>
<h3>Japanese Endo and Others Establish Aerial Achievements: Crash-Down American Aircraft Set Unprecedented Record</h3>
<p>Japanese Army Base, 28th Central News Agency dispatch: When the U.S. military's B-29 aircraft, which they boasted was an invincible air fortress, carried out its fourth air raid on Kitakyushu, Japan, on the evening of the 20th of this month, the Japanese naval air force also participated in the battle. Among them, a single-winged aircraft flown by Lieutenant Endo and Sergeant Ozaki established an unprecedented record of shooting down eight B-29s and destroying six. According to a report from a certain base, the air combat record of the Kotsu aircraft is as follows: At 2:16 p.m. that afternoon, a formation of five enemy aircraft suddenly appeared from the oblique sun 30 miles northwest of a certain island in Nagasaki Prefecture. Endo's aircraft charged into the enemy formation and fired at it. The first and third enemy aircraft were hit and left the formation. Lieutenant Endo decided to shoot down these two aircraft and immediately fired fiercely at the first aircraft. The left engine of the aircraft was hit, emitting black smoke, and the nose drooped, plunging into the sea. After Lieutenant Endo fired at the third aircraft, the base of the right wing was also hit, emitting black smoke, and it immediately plunged down. The time between the two aircraft crashing was only nine minutes from the time they were discovered. Twelve minutes after the first air battle, a formation of three enemy aircraft was encountered again, with two in front and one in the rear. Lieutenant Endo decided to attack one of them and immediately prepared to fire. The enemy aircraft's wings swayed up and down and gradually descended. The aircraft was spotted by the Japanese army's new Cisi reconnaissance aircraft, which confirmed that it had been shot down. At 6:00 p.m., two enemy aircraft were discovered fleeing at full speed. Lieutenant Endo's aircraft, from above, accurately hit the rear of the first enemy aircraft, and the wings of the second aircraft were also hit. Both aircraft crashed at the same time. At that time, Lieutenant Endo wanted to pursue, but unfortunately, the ammunition was exhausted.</p>

In southern France, the German garrison in the ports of Marseille and Toulon is still resisting resolutely, and the enemy's advance troops have advanced from Grenoble to Valence.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): Frontline news from the German News Agency: American troops and French rebels continue to increase their forces on the Paris front. The German garrison is still striving to resist the anti-Axis forces, which are superior in both quality and quantity. As of the 27th, artillery fire still echoed in Paris. Because the German army refused to surrender, the anti-Axis forces are now using large-caliber mortars and automatic cannons to fire into Paris. At the same time, since the afternoon of the 26th, American tank units have attempted to attack from the north and northeast suburbs of Paris, but after suffering heavy losses, they have stopped the action.

<h3>German Troops Fight Courageously in Southern France</h3>

The German army in the Rhone Valley successfully established contact with the rear on the 26th. After the American army's frontal attack on Valence failed, it attempted to attack the city from the east, but the German army was prepared and is now resisting strenuously. The German army launched a major attack on the anti-Axis forces on the road between Montélimar and Loriol, and the two armies are now engaged in fierce fighting in the mountainous area southeast of Loriol.</p>
<h3>Brest Garrison Refuses to Surrender</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: According to an official German announcement, the American army requested the German garrison of the Brest fortress on the Brittany Peninsula to surrender, but was refused. Therefore, the enemy attacked yesterday with a strong infantry and tank force, and the intensity of the battle increased with time. With the support of the German army's naval and air force artillery, the German garrison repelled all offensives, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties. The enemy has formed several local protruding points in the forward positions of the fortress, which have been blocked.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency: In the Brest fortress area, the American army has concentrated all its forces, and the start of a large-scale offensive seems imminent, because the shelling and air raids on the port and fortress have become more intense. The enemy attempted to enter the forward positions of the fortress, but was blocked by the German army's counterattack, and the enemy's persuasion to the German commander to surrender was also ignored. The American army has concentrated all its military strength to prepare for an attack on Brest, and has entrusted the areas of Lorient and Saint-Nazaire to French special attack teams and terrorist bandits, led by American officers. After the attack on the forward positions of Lorient completely failed, the terrorist bandits have now ceased their operations. Near Saint-Nazaire, the enemy is also completely in a passive position. The German naval artillery on the island of Cesembre near Saint-Malo continues to defend its position despite constant enemy shelling and air raids.</p>

<h3>Greece Makes Five Demands on Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Geneva, 28th (Central News Agency): German News Agency, London dispatch: The Greek government in exile today announced its five demands on the Bulgarian government as follows: The northern border of Greece should be militarily revised in favor of Greece. Punish the Bulgarian rulers, military leaders, and other responsible persons who opposed the Greek people. Pay reparations. Implement the policies of the anti-Axis countries. The anti-Axis countries should occupy Bulgaria.</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt personally went to Hawaii and convened a military conference of army and navy generals to give instructions on the rapid progress of the operation to retake the Philippines. It is said that the timing is in early September. Why is the US military so eager to forcibly wage war against Japan before completely agreeing on the Mariana Islands? The following points can be examined:</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Seeks to Win Hearts and Minds</h3>
<p>First, this is Roosevelt's policy of trying to win hearts and minds in the autumn election this year to seek a fourth term. Although there is much evidence to the contrary, whether the US government in wartime still adheres to democracy as a land of freedom, at least the presidential election is a form determined by the people's vote, and the support of the people is absolutely necessary. However, the US government is now mobilizing human and material resources in response to the huge military demand. Due to the difficulty of life and the increase in the number of deaths and injuries, the people's hearts towards the government's actions may not be good. The repeated strikes in military-related factories and the rise in prices illustrate this situation. Therefore, if Roosevelt wants to be elected for the fourth time in the autumn election this year, he must at least obtain a major victory sufficient to reverse this national fortune, eliminate national dissatisfaction, and at the same time, transform his aversion through victory. Roosevelt, in any case, must find a way to reduce the people's dissatisfaction during the war and eagerly launch a major offensive against the people.</p>
<h3>Japan's Combat Power Increases with Time</h3>
<p>Second, Japan's combat power is increasing with time. Before the Greater East Asia War, Japan had very little of the most important oil, tin, rubber, and other products in the munitions industry. It was considered quite difficult to carry out the war, but since it established Sumatra, Malaya, Java, Celebes, etc., it has been able to maintain a full supply. As a result of Japan's occupation of the world's main production areas of tin and rubber, the United States' supply has fallen into difficulty. In rubber products, almost all are reprocessed products or substitutes, which has been proven by the American-made B-29 bomber recently shot down in Japan.</p>
<p>In particular, quinine, a special medicine for malaria, is a special product of the South Seas Islands. The Greater East Asia War was launched in the South Seas, a malaria-stricken area, and has continued until now. Because the United States cannot obtain quinine, many people have died from the disease and are crying out in pain.</p>
<p>As for tin, although mines in Bolivia, South America have been developed, they are all substitutes of poor quality and have major shortcomings in manufacturing high-speed steel for military needs. Therefore, the later the war is, the more the United States' combat power will be weakened, and conversely, Japan's combat power will increase.</p>
<h3>The American People's Anti-War Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Third, the fact that the anti-war atmosphere of the American people is gradually intensifying cannot be ignored. The impact of the war is not considered a pleasant phenomenon by people all over the world. Moreover, the United States is gradually becoming poorer due to the shortage of necessary civilian supplies and the reduction in food production. In addition, the rise in prices and the increase in purchasing power caused by malignant inflation have further fueled this trend. Therefore, the living problems of the American people will now reach the breaking point. In addition, the unfavorable progress of the war has only increased deaths and injuries, and the war results obtained are only bullet-like islands in the Pacific Ocean. Retaking the Philippines, landing on the Chinese mainland, the defense war on the Japanese mainland, and new operations with intentions in the war will still require the sacrifice of huge human and material resources; conversely, the purpose of the war is not enough to inspire sacred human love and noble national love, but is only for Roosevelt's personal world desire and the profit-seeking desire of some capitalists. All these forms have contributed to the anti-war atmosphere of the general public.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to end the war one day earlier, and to make a soldier active on the battlefield, you need seventeen laborers in the country. The conduction of modern wars of a guiding nature is impossible, so the United States hopes for rapid progress in the war.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Japan raised the banner of liberating the oppressed peoples of Greater East Asia, and aimed to build a new order in Greater East Asia. The one billion people of East Asia united as one, hoping to realize the war's goals, and a formidable combat power is being developed.</p>
<h3>The United States Attempts to Obstruct Japan</h3>
<p>From the above points, it can be understood that the longer the decisive battle is delayed, the more advantageous Japan will be in terms of combat power. Therefore, the United States is now anxiously trying to destroy the fact that Japan is transferring the war resources of the southern regions it has maintained due to the victory of the Greater East Asia War to the Japanese mainland to enhance its combat power.</p>
<p>1.  Due to the fierce attack of the naval mobile unit in the Pacific, it wants to approach the Philippines, and in the Chinese mainland, it wants to cut off the southern communication line.</p>
<p>2.  Due to attacks on ships on the Chinese mainland and the Yangtze River, it attempts to cut off sea transportation routes.</p>
<p>3.  Due to the intensification of the air war on the Chinese mainland, it supports the Chongqing army, secures air bases against Japan, and at the same time, wants to strengthen pressure from the land.</p>
<p>4.  Due to the destruction of heavy industrial areas in Japan, it wants to reduce military production capacity.</p>
<p>In response, Japan succeeded in enticing the US army to the Mariana Islands for a "gradual reduction operation," while fortifying the Philippines, Taiwan, the Japanese mainland, and the Chinese mainland, accumulating combat power, preparing a posture to intercept, and waiting in strict formation for the enemy US army to attack. For example, on the 20th of this month, the attack on the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, which invaded Kyushu and the western part of China, was completely ineffective. Twenty-three enemy planes that were blindly bombing were shot down. In particular, the fighting spirit of the Japanese air defense soldiers who fiercely rushed towards two enemy planes and shot them down in one fell swoop made even the Americans gasp and call "The Japanese air force's political attacks are unexpectedly effective," implying the difficulty of invading the Japanese mainland.</p>
<h3>Japan Gains the Advantage of Timing and Geography</h3>
<p>On the issue of time, Japan, which has already gained the advantage of timing and natural geography, is enhancing its combat power to the highest degree with the genuine unity of the Chinese and Greater East Asian nations. - It is said that Japan's aircraft manufacturing capacity is now the second in the world, so Japan is of course the first in the number of aircraft in the Pacific. - The future strategic posture, which is not afraid of anything, is only conservative and silent, so it is believed that it will surely reduce the invading enemy army.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Strictly Restricts General Business Hours, Director Lu of the Administrative Office Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>In order to implement electricity and knife conservation consumption and practice wartime life thoroughly, the Municipal Police Bureau has restricted general business hours and related matters and announced its implementation. Lu Qi, Director of the Administrative Office of the Bureau, issued a special statement on this matter, as follows: "The purpose of the Bureau's regulations on general business hours and related matters this time, based on the Municipal Government's Announcement No. 7907 of the Shanghai Municipal Government on August 2 this year and Announcement No. 8182 of August 12, is to implement the government's orders, which goes without saying. At this time of traffic difficulties and transportation obstacles, increasing material resources is almost the first duty of the people. Furthermore, as the war becomes more tense, practicing wartime life to invigorate the spirit of the entire people and strive for victory is even more the duty of the people. Therefore, the Bureau's actions this time are purely inevitable, and the citizens should especially cooperate and strictly abide by them. The general situation in Shanghai at present is far from our ideals, so the Bureau's regulations are extremely strict in order to bring them into the right track.</p>
<h3>Same Restrictions for Self-Generation</h3>
<p>Now, many entertainment venues often set up candles or have their own power generation equipment to operate as usual after the regulated electricity usage time. In fact, the consumption of material resources is still unavoidable, and it also violates wartime life and creates a lock-up atmosphere. Therefore, the Bureau's regulations this time stipulate that those who operate without using electricity or their own power generation equipment shall still invite people to follow the Bureau's regulations and shall not exceed them in any way in order to thoroughly achieve the purpose of conservation and implementing wartime life. Shanghai's extravagance is the best in all regions. This phenomenon should not exist during wartime, and even in peacetime, why would it be good for the country's hard work? In times of national hardship, no matter what position one is in, one should take preserving the country's vitality as the premise and cultivate a national character of hard work and endurance.</p>
<h3>Customers Also Bear Corresponding Responsibilities</h3>
<p>The effect expected from the restrictions on business hours in the Bureau's announcement this time is to make citizens have a deep understanding of the current situation and strictly and solemnly control their own lives in addition to abiding by the time. No matter how strict the government's crackdown is, it is still necessary for citizens to be aware and cooperate. In addition to ordering each branch bureau to implement it earnestly and dispatch personnel to investigate at any time, the Bureau will consider copying the residence permit numbers of customers stranded in various entertainment venues outside the regulated business hours and imposing appropriate penalties on them. Because exceeding the restrictions on business hours is the fault of the operators, but customers also have relative responsibilities. It is hoped that you will pay attention to it carefully.</p>

<h3>A Humble Proposal to Improve Prison Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Yuan Rui-chang</p>
<p>In recent years, various countries around the world have not only focused on moral education for prisoners incarcerated for criminal offenses but also attached great importance to prison hygiene facilities. Good prison hygiene can affect the health of prisoners. Some say that improving prison hygiene treatment is tantamount to rewarding crime, which is a big mistake. The main point of freedom punishment lies in depriving or restricting the freedom of criminals, and it is impossible to harm their bodies and lives. It is the deserved result for a person to be imprisoned for committing a crime. However, if they do not have enough to eat and keep warm after being imprisoned, it is not permitted by humanity. If they get sick, become disabled, or die as a result, it is equivalent to adding physical punishment and life punishment to the punishment of freedom, which is not what they should receive. Therefore, the International Criminal Penalty Committee has regulations on the minimum treatment of prisoners, hoping to improve the treatment of criminals. The details focus on clothing, food, housing, labor, and medical care, and attention is paid to moral education so that they can repent, renew themselves, return to society, and become good and useful people. Furthermore, prisons are groups that deprive people of their freedom and are prone to various infectious diseases, which can affect public health. Therefore, in order to maintain humanity and protect the health of society, improving prison hygiene is an urgent matter. The late Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Justice Administration attached great importance to this issue. He died of typhus after inspecting foreign prisons. It can be seen that prisons neglect hygiene, and it is easy to die from infectious diseases. It is very worrying. As the head of the Wood City Health Department, I dare to write this humble proposal. I am grateful for the guidance of advanced social members.</p>
<p>Improvement Plan</p>
<p>A. Regarding Environmental Hygiene</p>
<p>Environmental hygiene includes buildings and all ventilation, lighting, heating, air volume, fire-fighting equipment, and the layout of prison buildings, such as prison cells, workshops, kitchens, bathrooms, sick bays, and pits, trenches, etc., must be carefully planned and fully equipped. The interior and exterior must be swept daily, scrubbed every other day, each room must have a spittoon, spitting on the ground is prohibited, sluices are often flushed, and pits and countries should be sprinkled with disinfectant water daily to ensure permanent cleanliness.</p>
<p>B. Regarding Diet</p>
<p>Diet nourishes the whole body, generates body temperature and strength, and replenishes consumed components. It is an essential element of life. Insufficient diet hinders nutrition, but inappropriate food combinations, improper cooking, or eating spoiled food are still not conducive to health, and may even lead to nutritional deficiency diseases and infections, leading to death. Therefore, prisons attach great importance to the handling of the diet of prisoners, striving to ensure that the quality and quantity can meet the necessary conditions for health. Generally, each person needs at least seven ge (approximately 0.74 liters) of rice or miscellaneous grains (such as millet, corn flour, and sorghum) per day, and at least four liang (approximately 200 grams) of green vegetables and soybeans per day, and two liang (approximately 100 grams) of fish or meat per week. As for food utensils, it is especially appropriate to adopt utensils that do not hinder hygiene, are easy to maintain, and do not produce toxins. The tableware for ordinary prisoners and sick prisoners should be used and disposed of differently in terms of color or form. The tableware of prisoners suffering from tuberculosis and infectious diseases should be strictly disinfected after each use to prevent infection.</p>
<p>C. Regarding Clothing and Bedding</p>
<p>Clothing and bedding regulate body temperature and prevent cold attacks. For the sake of maintaining prison hygiene, prisoners' clothing and bedding should be provided by the government. Each person should have two sets of single clothing and one set of cotton clothing and trousers. For the convenience of washing, and adding or subtracting according to the weather, each person must have four cotton blankets, which must be washed and dried frequently to avoid fleas and infectious diseases. The clothing and bedding of sick people and deceased prisoners must be disinfected. All new prisoners, after bathing, must change into prepared clothing and bedding, which must be disinfected and stored immediately to avoid bringing germs into the prison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau — Notice Jing Si Zi No. 17</h3>
<p>(Notice to all designated distributors in this city) In order to unify municipal administration and strengthen institutions, a Municipal Goods Rationing Office has been specially established to handle the rationing of various daily necessities in this city, so as to centralize authority. All rationing of firewood, soap, coal balls, etc., in Pudong, Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei districts, which were previously handled by this bureau, have been transferred to the Goods Rationing Office for continued handling since the 20th of this month. In the future, if there are any rationing matters, the distributors should contact the office. The deposits previously paid by the distributors should be returned to the fourth section of the bureau with the original receipt before September 30 to clear the procedures. In addition to reporting to the municipal government, it is necessary to notify everyone. This notice! Director Xu Tianshen</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau Proclamation — Jing Si Zi No. 18</h3>
<p>In view of the recent active promotion of electricity conservation in this city, factories, groups, and residences should all abide by it. However, if the factories throughout the city are all subject to electricity restrictions for military needs and daily necessities, it will have a significant impact on wartime production. Therefore, in order to understand the product situation and electricity consumption of each factory, the bureau has specially prepared an electricity consumption survey form for factories to fill in truthfully. The bureau will conduct on-site investigations based on the form in order to consider the situation and make adjustments. If it is indeed a military product and daily necessities, the electricity consumption will be appropriately increased; otherwise, it will be strictly restricted or the power supply will be stopped. This will not only encourage the rear to increase production but also adapt to the purpose of wartime conservation. All factories in the city are required to bring the factory seal and the responsible person's private seal to the fourth section of the bureau within one month from the date of publication to collect and fill out the form. Each form is five sheets and costs 100 yuan in national currency for printing and handling fees. Failure to report will be regarded as a voluntary waiver and the power will be cut off immediately without any tolerance. It is necessary to announce this to the public. Director Xu Tianshen, August 28, 1941</p>

<h3>National Forum: Suggestions to the Municipal Tram Company Authorities</h3>
<p>— Chun Feng</p>
<p>Since the tram company, in compliance with the authorities' intention to conserve electricity, adjusted its routes and reduced the number of trams, the "travel" problem of citizens from all walks of life has been considerably affected. One only needs to observe the long lines of passengers at major starting and ending stations during work hours, and the anxious and frustrated expressions of each passenger, to understand this clearly. If an emergency occurs, or a sudden rainstorm arrives, order and peace are further adversely affected. However, since electricity conservation is a settled policy, the only solution is to seek appropriate technical improvements to ensure that the public has no inconvenience or loss, while the citizens benefit. I would like to offer the following improvement suggestions:</p>
<p>Modify Tram Schedules</p>
<p>The current schedule and vehicle allocation have already been improved significantly compared to the past, such as increasing the number of trams during work hours. However, in practice, it is still insufficient to meet demand. Therefore, it is hoped that a thorough revision can be made quickly, taking into account the work hours of government agencies, private organizations, and major production companies and factories. Similar to train schedules, the number of trams running each day should be specified, i.e., 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM (hypothetically, the same applies below), 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, as fixed operating times. The originally scheduled trams should all run during these times, and completely stop outside these times. In this way, passengers will have a set schedule, and the increased frequency of trams running during these times will reduce waiting times, saving considerable mental and physical effort, and preventing disruption to public and business affairs. The tram company can also reasonably adjust its trams, personnel, and operations, which will undoubtedly lead to greater efficiency in business. As for the general public who are stopped from traveling, they can switch to human-powered rickshaws or walk. After the implementation of this new method, the city's traffic order will certainly be transformed.</p>
<p>Correct Tram Routes</p>
<p>The current tram routes in District 1, although the result of repeated deliberation and revision, seem beyond reproach. However, past considerations were based on old operating hours. If the above suggestions are adopted, then for the sake of facilitating the actual needs of all sectors, some essential old routes without other means of transportation should be restored as soon as possible. The most urgent needs among these are the long-distance routes of Lines 5, 3, and 1/12. The restoration of Line 5 is related to Shanghai's outer city transportation, greatly benefiting North Station passengers and small freight transportation; while Lines 3 and 12 are more directly related to wartime production enterprises. As for restoring long-distance transportation, since the suspension of through-trains, passengers traveling to central stations (such as Nanjing Road/Bund) must queue again to wait for trams, often spending an unspeakable amount of time and energy from the starting point through transfer stations, greatly affecting the work efficiency of political, cultural, and industrial personnel. Conversely, the tram company has not seen any benefit from the suspension of long-distance travel. As for ticket sales after the restoration of long-distance travel, long-distance tickets can be purchased at the starting station, which can save printing costs, so buying two tickets should not be inconvenient.</p>
<p>Regarding the Fare Issue</p>
<p>(A) Fare Increase: Considering current prices and the current fees for various vehicles, the low fare of trams in District 1 is widely praised. In terms of reason and rationale, a price increase is also quite reasonable. However, the authorities' policy of maintaining established fares and avoiding price stimulation is also commendable. Furthermore, public utilities are managed and subsidized by the authorities, and are not (necessarily) required to compete for profit with general private institutions. It is believed that the existing fare structure causes the company to suffer excessive losses, which is also a fact, and it is even more abhorrent that vagrants and beggars mix into trams to beg. Therefore, a moderate increase is not impossible. However, increases must be in multiples of five or ten cents, otherwise it will be a loss for either the passengers or the company.</p>
<p>(B) Corruption: The losses may be incurred by the company or by the passengers. For the company, the main issue is the corruption of ticket sellers on the tram. For passengers, the main issue is the retention of change by ticket sellers in booths at each station. The main reason for this is that employees' salaries are insufficient to maintain their livelihoods, and that the prevention of long-standing bad habits has not been done properly, which is also a major reason. Therefore, the following measures can be taken in the future: Unify the fare to five or ten cents, which will facilitate the payment of change; completely abolish ticket sales on the tram, leaving only one driver and one assistant per tram, and add one assistant for trams with two cars; the driver will also be responsible for opening and closing the front door, while the assistant will only be responsible for opening and closing the rear and trailer doors and assisting with other driving matters, and neither will be allowed to handle tickets; tickets must be purchased in advance before boarding, and inspectors will be assigned to check tickets at the tram doors; tickets must be collected when disembarking, and those without tickets will be fined twice the fare; the previous practice of exchanging fifty accumulated tickets for a lottery ticket, which does not conform to the Chinese "face-saving" concept, can be abolished. If the above tram schedules are revised, the company will not lack personnel.</p>
<p>Rectify Traffic Order</p>
<p>In the past six months, due to the diligent improvements made by the authorities and the company, improvements have been seen, but the situation has worsened since the reduction in the number of trams. In the future, if the above three new methods are followed, traffic order will certainly improve again. However, during tram operating times, passengers will inevitably crowd together. Therefore, a segmented queuing method can be adopted, setting up more ticket booths in the vicinity of the stations, near open spaces, at least two booths per station, with two lines for every three people. When a certain number of people is exceeded, another section should be formed. This will avoid obstructing general traffic and reduce the suffering and danger of queuing passengers, and ensure the quiet and tidiness of the station. However, at least two traffic maintenance officers must be assigned to each line, wearing uniforms and clearly marked with numbers. Except for military police personnel and pregnant women with obvious signs, no one should be allowed to cut in line. If there is any favoritism or irresponsibility in correcting this, other passengers will be allowed to report it. If passengers voluntarily allow others to enter the queue, the tram traffic maintenance officer may order them to leave together.</p>
<h3>Long-Cherished Wish (9) Navy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock the next morning, Shengfu got off the streetcar at a certain point and walked straight to the Ministry of the Navy. He had seen the Ming Dynasty brick buildings from the tram, but this was the first time he had set foot in the courtyard. He thought to himself that there must be a steel statue of an old navy pioneer from his hometown standing in the courtyard, but he didn't bother to look for it.</p>
<p>He hesitated and wandered in front of the gate for a long time. Just as he was about to enter, the guard asked him his purpose.</p>
<p>"Since that's the matter, turn that way!"</p>
<p>Following the direction, he passed a dimly lit communication room. After explaining his purpose at the window, a middle-aged man silently took out a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Longfu filled out the form with his name, the name of the person he was visiting, the reason for his visit, and whether he had a prior appointment. After handing it to the clerk, he felt very uneasy. Would Lieutenant Colonel Feitian, who was so busy, meet with me? Besides, would he remember my name?</p>
<p>But after waiting for a while, the clerk reappeared and said simply and clearly,</p>
<p>"Please come this way!"</p>
<p>He went up the old and dim stairs. When he reached the corridor on the second floor, the clerk said, "It's over there," and left.</p>
<p>The gray door in front was tightly closed. Longfu stood there in a bit of a panic for a while. Because this was the Ministry of the Navy. What if he opened the door at random and found himself in a large auditorium?</p>
<p>However, just then, someone came out from the other side. It was a man without a suit jacket.</p>
<p>"Is this the reporting department?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes."</p>
<p>Longfu was relieved and went in. In the room with neatly arranged desks, many people were working, and the sound of telephones was buzzing. Everyone was busy, so there was no one to greet or receive visitors.</p>
<p>But a clean-shaven soldier sitting in front of a desk inside suddenly looked up, saw Longfu, and waved his hand. Oh, that face, he remembered.</p>
<p>"Are you Mr. Feitian?"</p>
<p>To avoid making a mistake, Longfu asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am."</p>
<p>The lieutenant colonel read half of the introduction letter from Shao Wei, which had been delivered, and said to Longfu:</p>
<p>"The lieutenant has told me about you. I've seen your paintings at the Navy Exhibition... Please write a resume and attach it! Don't forget to write down your current address. And send a two-inch half-length portrait..."</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Feitian, with his delicate features, rose to his feet with a voice that did not match his face. The meeting lasted only three minutes. (136)</p>
<h3>Social Service: Zhe Shao Hospital Adds Western Medicine</h3>
<p>— Pei Yunqing</p>
<p>Nearly one million people from the seven counties of Shaoxing living in Shanghai have long-established rules for matters of health and death. Although fellow villagers do not lack in dispensing medicine for the poor and sick, the establishment of a hospital began in the 29th year of the Republic of China. Yunqing followed in the footsteps of my fellow villagers and elders, purchasing a hospital building at the intersection of Haining Road and North Shaanxi Road, setting up separate wards for men and women, and employing Chinese medicine physicians in internal medicine, surgery, and ophthalmology to treat the poor and sick and provide medicine. Those with severe illnesses were admitted to the hospital. Since its opening, the scale has been roughly established. This is all thanks to the kindness and generosity of my fellow villagers, who have created immeasurable blessings. Yunqing, in his own capacity, should strive for progress. Since the beginning of summer, preparations have been made to add Western medicine, modify the wards, and set up an operating room. Doctors Yu Ruxian, Chen Demao, and Qin Tingji have been hired to serve as vice president, medical director, and in charge of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and other departments. Starting from September 1, the hospital will be completely converted to Western medicine. The original Chinese medicine physicians in internal medicine and surgery will be moved to the Shanghai Tongxiang Association of Shaoxing's seven counties on Anqing Road, where they will continue to provide diagnosis and medicine, not limited to fellow villagers. Buddhists consider birth, old age, sickness, and death to be the greatest sufferings of mankind. I hope that my fellow villagers in Shanghai who have great aspirations and want to relieve this suffering will not hesitate to provide guidance and suggestions.</p>
<h3>Good Opportunity to Learn Painting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is launching a Western book tutoring class this semester. There are no restrictions on entry qualifications. Classes are scheduled from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. Tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 2,200 yuan. It is also heard that the school has hired Ms. Shen Yaqin to serve as the director of the piano group in the music department. In addition, founder Liu Haisu will come to the school twice a week to lecture in order to improve the academic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Since the Song Dynasty's English Book Room opened the second "Jin Zhi" room with the title of Grand Duchess Gergé, the entrance examination has been extremely strict. Song's painting studio has scheduled the start of the semester on September 4. Those who wish to study with him can still register for the exam. Application forms can be obtained from the First "Jin Zhi" Room, No. B14, Shanchang Lane, Carter Road.</p>
<h3>Charity School and Scholarships</h3>
<p>The next semester of the Zhixing Night School at No. 17, Shunchang Road (formerly Bill Road) will begin on September 11. Several more famous teachers have been hired. Tuition for middle school and business courses starts at 550 yuan, and tuition for elementary school starts at 250 yuan. Electives such as accounting, bookkeeping, English, British business calculation, economics, etc., start at 150 yuan per course. Students with poor family circumstances and excellent character can apply for the school's scholarship. In addition, this semester, the school is cooperating with a certain chemical factory to run an industrial drug chemistry manufacturing department, which can be completed in one year for those with junior high school education or above. Students with excellent character can be guaranteed to work at the chemical factory.</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple in this city, in view of the increasing number of rural children losing their education after the incident, has specially established the Buddhist Nanxiang Rural Primary School in the Xili East Township branch of the temple in Nanxiang Town to provide relief. Previously, the abbot of the temple, Dewu, the supervisor Mijia, and local gentry held a founders' meeting, which decided to jointly raise 500,000 yuan for expenses. The preparations have been actively underway for several months, and everything is ready. It is now scheduled to open on September 15. However, it is reported that there is still a shortage of 100 to 150 desks and chairs. It is hoped that those who are willing to care for education will come to discuss the matter in person.</p>
<p>The School of Commerce of Huadong University has hired Wang Ruilin of Global Trust Company to teach accounting, Qu Jingzhou to teach commercial arithmetic, Yin Minglu of Taiping Insurance Company to teach industrial and commercial management, and Zhong Xiangqing of Nanyang Tobacco Company to teach statistics this semester. Advance the teaching of applied subjects to cultivate practical talents in a short period of time, and hold classes after 4:00 PM so that industrial and commercial employees can also take electives. Therefore, it has gained the support of all sectors, and they have automatically donated scholarships of 5,000 yuan each, totaling 50,000 yuan. All freshmen in the first year can apply, and enrollment is now starting.</p>
<h3>Health Guidance</h3>
<p>The Effectiveness of Meditation: I joined the Yinjin Meditation Society last year, and in less than half a year, I was able to pass three passes. Therefore, I became more diligent. Every time I meditate, my heart feels like a bright moon shining and filling my whole body. This summer vacation, I gathered those who had achieved results in previous meditation sessions and begged the teacher to study Da Zhou Tian De. Sometimes during meditation, I feel that my body is tall and goes up into the clouds, which makes me terrified. When I asked the teacher about it, the teacher said: This is the appearance of a tall body, which is a good sign, but you must let it be natural and not cling to it. The method of meditation is great for escaping life and death, and small for reducing illness and prolonging life. In the society, those who suffer from chronic diseases, such as Yao Ziming's neurasthenia and liver disease, Li Xingxiao and He Guangren's early-stage lung disease, and someone's stomach disease, have all recovered. The society is now recruiting the sixth batch of members, which will begin on the afternoon of September 2. If the number of people does not exceed the quota, classes will still be held at No. 58, Yongqingfang, New Dagu Road. (Shen Yinmei)</p>
<p>Friends' Aid Hospital Provides Preferential Treatment to the Academic Community: Friends' Aid Hospital on Shengmuyuan Road and Pushi Road provides voluntary treatment to the academic community. If you are poor, you can also receive medicine. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM. If you have any difficult or serious illnesses and cannot move, you can send a letter detailing the symptoms, and they can also provide answers without charge.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Prevention Needles Have Long Been Disinfected</h3>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau sent a letter yesterday stating: "In the Social Services column of the Shenbao on August 24, there was an article entitled 'Epidemic Prevention Injectors Should Pay Attention to Needle Disinfection,' which stated that the writer had seen in several places that injectors often used syringes to draw vaccine and attach needles, and injected dozens of people in succession without disinfection, and some did not disinfect at all from beginning to end, so that knowledgeable people saw it and regarded it as a dangerous path. It should follow the method of the Health Department of District 1, gather needles for disinfection, so that there will be no future troubles...etc.' After investigation, the epidemic prevention was originally carried out by the Municipal Health Bureau and the Health Department of District 1. The disinfection methods for all needles and syringes, in addition to those in District 1 as mentioned by Zhou Jun, the previous disinfection method of the Health Bureau was to disinfect a large number of needles and syringes in the bureau before departure, and then take them to the work site for application. It is suspected that it was not disinfected, and the reason is here. Now that the bureau and department have been merged, the disinfection methods have been uniformly implemented according to the previous District 1. Because the report is not entirely in line with the facts, it should be corrected. The Municipal Health Bureau"</p>
<h3>Sending Tai Chi Long Dysentery Tablets</h3>
<p>Since this office has been distributing "Liqi Ling" dysentery tablets produced by Ledford Pharmaceutical Factory, those who ask for them have been coming one after another, which shows the prevalence of dysentery recently. Now, Mr. Gu Yongfu has also kindly donated 20 packages of "Tai Chi Long Dysentery Tablets," which are also a holy medicine for treating dysentery. After taking them, they can kill bacteria and reduce swelling, and the effect is very fast. Poor patients can ask for them at this office</p>
<p>In addition, Longquan Pujiji Pill produced by the Guangdong Long Pharmaceutical Factory's Shanghai Office is effective for seasonal colds, fever, headache, cholera, vomiting and diarrhea, and dysentery and malaria. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, go to No. 25, Lane 761, Jiangsu Road to ask for them, free of charge. For out-of-town mail orders, please attach sufficient postage stamps and write the address on the envelope, and it will be sent by the original staff.</p>
