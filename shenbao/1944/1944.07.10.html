<h3 id="c1">增加敎育經費 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>從下學期起各級學校學費的增加巳經是決定的子，學費的數”據說以八月份米價為標準，小學若干斗，中學若干斗，大學若干斗，照目前米糧統制和收買的情形看來，平定米價固不可能，收買的數量叉是極微小，對國家，對國民，兩無好處，但是黑市米價倒反又提高了．這種情形，如若繼續下去，想想八月份的米價如何，下學期的學費如何，眞會令人不寒而慄。無數有志讀書而無力繳費的只有望校鬥而興嘆，留在校內的僅僅是少數有力繳費而不一定有志讀畫的人，學校的貴族化可說已達到了頂點。</p>
<p>大多數的平民沒有受敎育的機會，這是國民的損失，這是國家民族的損失，這是政府應該負的責任。在這千鈞一髪的時候，賢明的政府應當在這暑假期間，一方面積極調整學校，內容充實的准予續辦，內容不充實的立即停閉，一方面增加敎育經費的補助，使優良的敎師們生活安定，淸寒的學生們不致失學。主持敎育和財政的當局們，這是替國家民族立功，這是替下一代子孫們服務的唯一機會。生在大時代的人，必須做幾件大時代的事，大時代裹的政府更是責無旁貸，義不容電。</p>
<p>敎育國民是任何國家的基礎事業。凡是國民都有受敎育的權利，受了敎育之後，都有為國家服務的義備。所以文明國家，對於小學教育大都是强迫的免費的，所謂義務國民敎育，對於中學和大學又有公立的而收費極低的，因此使淸寒優秀子弟得以深造。國家為什麼要這樣做，因為這樣，下一代的國民然後可比上一代的國民優秀，下一代的國家民族然後可比上一代的國家民族進步。優秀的國民創造進步的國家，進步的國家可以永存，不進步的國家必歸於消減。日本德國的强盛是國民優秀的結果，是注重敎育的成續，世界歷史上敎育興國的事，不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>國家在敎育事業上多化一分錢，就替國家多打一分基礎，就替下一代的國民多增加一分新力量，政府不應當放任私人敎育機關的高業化，一面取締，一面就須幫助。政府不應當坐視着靑年失學而不救，他要想法子救濟·扶動敎育事業為大家的需要，增加敎育經費更為大家所贊同，所以政府即使為了增加敎育經費而舉債，正如家長為了兒子求學而借債，同樣的有此迫切需要。</p>
<h3 id="c2">日機猛炸敵艦隊　塞島展開肉搏戰　襲大宮島敵機擊落十四架 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社重中部太平洋日軍某基地電：塞班島上現已，到處展開激烈之肉搏戰，呼應此戰鬥之迭尼安島日軍砲台，六日夜會對塞班島之阿斯利特機塲加以猛烈砲擊，又日軍航空隊亦於八日黎明對塞班島之敵陣地機場及其他各地加以轟炸，尤其對塔保書山西南側之敵陣地，於敵夜間戰鬥機及猛烈砲火抵抗之下，予以準確之轟炸。一方於六日深夜日航空部隊更於塞班島東南方海面，對敵之巡洋艦與驅逐艦羣予以猛烈攻擊。</p>
<p>中部太平洋日軍基地九日中央社電六日畫問曾有敵艦載機約五十架，來襲大宮島，被當地日軍擊落六架，將其擊退。七日更有敵機約七十架來襲，被擊落八架，於此兩日日軍損失輕微。</p>
<h3 id="c3">東亞各地日軍　一週間戰况 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電大東亞戰域過去一週間之戰况如次：</p>
<p>北方方面</p>
<p>該方面無大變化，六月下旬來襲敵機共二十五架，中太平洋及阿留串方面敵軍兵力已增强，仍應嚴加戒備。</p>
<p>中國方面</p>
<p>湖南日軍沿粵漢綫南進，三日佔領衡陽機塲，西進部隊四日佔愼永　，現仍進擊中。華南方面日軍員六月二十七日突然向北進攻，七月一日至四日間先後攻佔龍華墟·龍門·從化。淸遠等要衝，另一部隊於六月二十九日佔領新寗錢適要衡可山。又由上海方面出動之日軍進攻衢州，目的完成後恢復原態，截止二日所收戰果如次：日軍收容渝軍屍體五〇八〇具，俘虜六六四人，鹵獲砲二十五門重輕機槍一三一挺，槍支三三〇支，各種彈藥甚多。又日空軍三日曉數次急襲潮南西南之芷江，炸毀地上敵機六架擊毀三架，另一隊日機轟炸常德，四日奇襲四川巴東及陜西之西安。八日自中國飛來敵機十餘架侵入九州西部，因日軍之防空陣，敵未得逞，即行遁去。</p>
<p>緬甸方面</p>
<p>敵軍為打通哥希馬公路，領其物量併死來攻，六月二十三日密體東方五七九七高地，但該處日軍仍確保各要點。又又據守比先　爾西南要點之日軍對敵之進攻，予以重創。（巴列爾方面）日軍確保東北高地，擊破反攻之敵軍，密芝那方面之敵軍，六月二十八日晚起開始反攻，但日軍曾予敵重創。又六月下句敵機來襲泰國及越南達二十一次，共三十架。</p>
<p>南太平洋</p>
<p>必阿克島重要據點，雖為敵佔領，然日軍以寡兵衝入敵陣，二日敵軍以猛烈艦砲飛機據護下，在孟買爾島登陛，必阿克西方該島似已為敵佔領，所羅門方面之拉巴爾，自六月二十九日至七月五日止，來襲敵繼累計五八八架，該島日守繼錄士氣旺盛，與敵熾烈應戰。加比恩在　期間內，來襲敵機累計一二四架，來襲布加地區之敵機累計二六架，波根維爾島南部日軍地區自六月二十九日迄七月五日止，連日所有敵機來襲累計二八九架。</p>
<p>中太平洋</p>
<p>塞班島之陸上戰鬥，刻在加拉邦塔保喬一帶激戰中。據日大本營六日發表，敵宣在飛機艦船砲火掩護下侵入日軍隨地，日空軍呼應塞班島陸上部隊之奮戰，連日猛炸在該島敵陣地附近海面游弋中之敵艦艇及運輸船團，自六月二十日至三十日判明之戰果，計炸沉敵戰艦一艘，巡洋艦三艘，驅逐艦二艘，運輸艦二艘，炸毀航空母艦二艘，驅逐艦二艘，動輸艦五艘擊落敵機二一一架，刻敵有力艦隊猶在馬利亞納海域游弋中，復有以特設航空母艦為生幹之機動部隊，在小笠原羣島之硫礦島附近販及大宮島附近蠢動之敵，常以大型機來襲。日空軍曾猛炸塞班島敵陣地，使飛機塲附近兩地點中彈起火，一日夜轟炸阿斯科特機塲，炸毀敵機五架。又日偵察機曾於一日白畫在馬利亞納西方海面發現敵潛艇，當對之加以轟炸，現敵空軍在猛炸利特機塲，逐次增强力量，該島戰况已形重大化。隨塞班島戰局之轉變，敵機動部隊之行動倍種活躍，一日曾以飛機五十架乃至七十架來襲迭尼安·大宮島·羅特島·三日曾有敵巡洋艦數艘來襲大宮島實行砲擊，幷以飛機三十架轟炸該島，與此相前後羅特島亦有敵機約十架來襲，敵機動部該會於三日出現於硫磺島附近海面，與日軍交戰兩日。又計來襲硫磺島之敵機累計數百架，敵巡洋艦及驅逐艦數艘以砲擊該島。</p>
<h3 id="c4">印頃前綫的雨季攻防戰 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>印緬戰綫巳進入眞正的雨季，目下日軍在各戰綫，冒雷聲輿奈雨，繼續進行超人的「無雨季的攻勢」。最近前綫傳來消息，寸尺之地，連續進行肉搏，故戰事表面上入於膠着狀態時，實際即展開了激烈的攻防戰。</p>
<p>單就雨季而論，目繼邊境的雨季，與我們內地的「梅雨」，火異其越。惟雨季開始，多少有早晚之分，目下成為决戰塲的伊姆法爾周國，自本年四月底開始，富貴地館，則自五月初旬進入雨季。每年自此鄧以至十月下旬止的牛年之久，被不斷的大雨所幽閉。</p>
<p>自此以後，一日間所降的雨量，每每可抵日本一年三分之一的雨量，橋標和道路都被冲毀，工程隊赤綠與濁流挑戰，齊腰沒入泥濘之中，卡事的車身流滑着，第一綫的補給，就在這種情形中進行。</p>
<p>仰光米給在這時揮秧下種，對於植物也許是適宜的，但動於人類的生活，眞是惡劣到無以復加。一般溫度為三十二度至三十七度，待雨稍息，穿上軍服，衣服上已生了臭蟲。傷塞，霍亂，痢疾，熱病，種種疫病，不一而足。飛機塲化為一片汪洋，飛機的影踪，逐漸减少。</p>
<p>該方面的戰事，向例一入雨季，即不復作積極的攻勢，但今次都例外，展開了雨季攻勢。因為敵方打通哥希馬通至伊姆法爾公路的企圖，尙未貫澈，故持其物量之衆，在强大的空軍掩護下，向强大的空軍進出部隊，實行反攻，日軍隨處予以迎擊，敵方卒不得　。巴萊爾方面之敵，利用天險，自堅固陣地，用積拚命反攻，尤其企繼自合格諾波爾三义路附近，衝擊日軍側背，日軍精銳，冒着千辛萬苦，反覆進行肉彈夜襲戰，數日來敵力主力已悄然退去。</p>
<p>比先波爾力面一入雨季，伊姆法爾平地入敵空輸力減退，在此處空之中，敵方漸感壓迫，當買地區亦受雨季的災難，敵以空中部隊，降下新銳美國式渝羣，對於該區瀕於孤立的新編第一軍，拚命增援，而圖與渡越怒江的重慶遠征軍取得運絡。密芝那方面，敵方企圖以新銳部賺增援，挽回頹勢，日方亦逐漸增加新銳部隊，轉瞬即將展開肉搏戰。</p>
<p>要之，各戰綫所見的膠着狀態，實為受自然的惡條件所阻，而顯現的雨季作戰的特性。敵方英美，不顧這惡條件。念念不忘於奪回緬甸北部，打通萊多公路。最近將印編戰綫與太平洋戰綫一視同仁，補充飛戰·大砲·戰車及戰鬥員。哥希馬附近，一日之間，發射砲彈五千枚之多。據敵方慶播稱：「反輪心軍乘雨季向日軍猛攻，演成出乎意外的出血戰。」自認作戰的困難。</p>
<p>總之，印緬戰綫的雨季攻防戰，不僅切實反映現戰局的深刻性，同時因為此一戰役，非克復大自然的惡條件，不能巡行作戰，對於東亞戰局的現勢，自有　大的影響。（譯自六月十四日置賣新聞）</p>
<h3 id="c5">日軍航空隊　襲贛州機塲　新城機塲亦受重創 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>日軍某基地九日中央社電日軍航空隊轟炸機隊，七日深夜曾轟炸渝美空軍前進基地贛州機塲，及贛州東方廿五公里之新城機塲，予以重創。轟炸贛州機塲之一隊，於渝美軍猛烈砲火中，猛炸該機場之滑翔路，及掩護體，並炸毀戰鬥機兩架，熒毀戰鬥機五架，擊　大型轟炸機一架，此外並破壞軍事設施多處。又空襲新城機場之一隊日機，巳將其滑翔路炸戰，使於相當期內不能使用，於上兩役中，日機均安然返防。</p>
<p>敵機侵入連雲上空</p>
<p>靑島九日中央社電　八日上午一時三十分，有機型不明之敵機一架，侵入淮海省運雲地區上空。關於此事，靑島方面特別根據地司令部發表如次：八日一時三十七分，有機型不明之敵機（三引擊）一架，自西方侵人·盲炸運數地區，全彈投人海中，於一時五十五分遁走，當地陸上設施及市街毫無損害。</p>
<p>敵機來襲安慶未逞</p>
<p>華中日電某基地九日中央社電　敵方B25型轟炸機三架，及P51戰罷機四架。於本月七日十二時三十分左右來襲安慶，潔日陸海軍防空機隊截擊未逞。敵戰關機二架被擊落（內一架尙未確定），其餘逃云，日軍損害尠</p>
<p>冀西日軍所獲戰果</p>
<p>石門九日中央社電　冀省日軍及保安隊，六月份於冀西地區　共所獲綜合戰果如次：交戰次數五七·共匪兵力七九零五，藥屍三五五，俘擄二九一，鹵獲步槍一七八，同彈藥二三五，手槍入十，同彈藥一二六，手溜彈三三，洋砲七五，地雷六九，覆滅設施一六四。</p>
<p>渝軍敗績影響全局　　里斯木九日中央社電　日軍於中國戰綫展開進攻戰，已予反軸心陣營以極大衝動。據倫敦電，英「新政治家」週刋，曾於八日指稱，渝軍敗北，影響戰局甚大。其大意謂渝軍殆未抵抗，此次日軍沿奧漢綫慶開之新作戰，日軍之進攻，今後若按現在速度進行，則不久中國大陸將被切為兩斷，日軍則能確保由滿洲通至華南之陸上遽絡綫。一方衡陽一旦失陷，則反軸心空軍前進基地即告喪失，駐渝美空軍勢不能繼續對渝不作有效之援助。</p>
<h3 id="c6">對中日聲明　渝軍民極感動 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>漢口九日中央社電據渝電，自中日政府同時發表聲明，該項消息傳至重慶後，全體軍民極為感動。藎渝方軍民對盲目抗戰之行為，早已發生懷疑，尤對英美軍在渝之種種暴行，更為髮指。中日政府聲明共作戰對象，乃在擊滅英美，制轟柬亞之野心，非欲併吞中國，因此深自成覺其嚴正侵略中國，侵略東亞者實為英美而非日本，故目下抗戰情緒極為不振。各地和平空氣，日趨濃厚。尤對國民政府發出之聲明更為欣奮，渝方首腦到此情況，深感不安，雖煞費苦心，大施其伎倆，無奈民情所趨，希望和平，其所施奸謀，徒見其心勞日拙而已。</p>
<h3 id="c7">緬甸政府　電賀鮑斯 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>仰光九日中央社電　緬政府當此自由印度臨時政府主席「飽斯就職週年紀念慶祝週」之日，特向鉋斯氏致電祝賀。其大意謂閣下以不世之才，身　指導者之資任，故此二年不僅在印度史上且在整個東亞歷史上實為最堪注目之年。吾人為整個東亞之將來，熱望印度早日獲得自由，同時更切望閣下保持健康，對現世最具價值且最偉大之聖業，予以一種力量及成功之機會。</p>
<h3 id="c8">德軍全力抗戰　克恩成廢墟　美軍正展開呼應攻勢 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　德軍當局宣稱：英軍自七日夜至八日間曾不斷砲擊克恩市，該市已化為廢城。衆認此次英軍砲擊克恩市，係新攻勢之序幕，英軍轟炸機隊亦曾於七日猛炸克恩兩側及南方之德軍陣地。</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日中央社電　海通社訊：據本日路透社息，英國及加拿大軍巡　隊及坦克車隊，已於昨夜進抵奧納河西岸克恩城中心。</p>
<p>里斯本九日中央社電　克恩地區英軍開始新攻勢以來，自克困局至柯坦汀半島西部之拉海杜布伊全戰綫，展開激戰。克恩區之英第二軍置重點於該市西方七哩之半圓形戰綫，現正傾全力繼續猛攻中。一方德軍於該市南方及西南方以重兵器反復攻擊，目下於距該市中央一哩半之地方，兩軍正繼續拉鋸戰。又桑洛北八哩之桑向特迭市附近，卡倫坦至貝里坎道路上·及拉海杜布伊市，在戰繼中心之攻防戰已逐漸激烈。又據德軍之某某員報告，八日諾曼第橋頭堡之德軍，因於各地點熱烈抵抗關係，反軸心軍作戰計劃已被挫折</p>

<p>（再續）不但如此，重慶方面也還有路百命為左冀的人們，一方面和共產黨聯合，醞　反對，一方面　誘蔣先生接受所謂民主的要求。然而這些人在共產黨的策略決　裏，不過看做小有產者的民主主義者，和右冀的頭固派，反動派沒有兩樣。共產黨自已說得明白，絕不再替投機份子做歌舞隊，祗把這些投機份子，來做暫時聯合的策略的帮閒，在反蔣鬥爭之中，和鬥爭之後，一有機會，必須立即提出自己的要求。從第一期起，不信任的態度，不當加於被打倒的反動的黨派。反過來，要加於向來和他們聯合的同志，這些決議原文，所謂左翼的投機份子，不知作何感想，我們看了，實在替他一們寒心。</p>
<p>戰爭是政治的延長，打起仗來，大家都不肯說為戰爭而戰爭，總要樹起一塊政治的招牌來號召，而事實上，却滑稽得很。舉例來說，英美打着民主政治的招牌，云反法西斯主義，可是因為打仗的緣故，英美內部的政治機構，經濟制度，一步一步被法西斯主義征服了，失掉了民主政治的精神。羅斯福·邱吉爾·天天在號召。那愛自由，愛民主的美國人英國人，為反對法西斯的希特勒·墨索里尼·去打　·如果美國人英國人眞是愛自由，愛民主的話，不是要趕快起來首先打倒那正在法西斯化的羅斯繼和邱吉爾嗎？再舉一個例，蘇聯打着共產主義的招牌，去打倒法西斯主義，又是打起仗來，第三國際已經取銷了，國際歌也廢止了，換上一首替代國際歌的　聯新國歌·國際歌是中國共產黨所最愛唱，不識對此新歌，還唱得出口否？裹面滿紙的祖國自由獨立，半句共產主義，半句無產階級也見不着了。似乎法西斯主義沒曾打倒，共產主義已不要了。至於我們中國呢，十年勦共，結果弄成今日的田地，戰爭越拖延，共產黨越發坐大，這樣下去，畢竟如何收拎。</p>
<p>頗聞有人說道，繼續戰爭的困難，以及英美之不盡可靠，蔣先生不是不知道的，祗是到了今日，已成騎虎難下之勢，進退維谷，除了任人攏佈，繼續下去，也沒有別的辦法。我們以為這當然是尾巴主義失敗的打擊，　　這種打算，祇好越鎭越深，越深越不能自拔。要自拔，祇有立刻認出英夫的圈套，爭取主動。如今明明白白有一條救中國，保東亞的大路，為什麼捨之不由，却白自要落在英美閣套作護自縛呢？</p>
<p>又頗聞有人說道，蔣先生不是不打算尋求和平的，祗是也認定要有第三者來做保陣，才靠得住。我們於此，不能不提出三點，希望重慶方面加以注意。其一，這所謂第三者保障的辦法，數十年來外交史上，所受痛苦的經騐，實在太多了。其二，中日兩國的關係，是中日兩大民族的事，東亞局勢的處理，是東亞民族的事，為什麼要仰他人的鼻息。第三，和平友好的最大保障，第一是誠意，第二是力量，祗有雙方拿出誠意來，確立共存共榮的原則，並且拿出力量來，維特這原則，才是是大的保陣。自已的命運，最靠得住的運是自已的誠意和自己的力量。共同的命運最靠得住的，也就是共同的誠意和共同的力量。所謂誠意是相對的，不是片面的，如果要假手於他人，即不過是權謀術數而已。所謂力量，日本的力量，日本的力量不祇是保衛日太的力量，並且是保衛東亞的力量，任何人不能否認。這力量應該珍重的。我們呢，也必須有盡其在我的力量，才有分担責任的資格，這力量也應當珍重的。要是連這一點點的本錢也都賭盡輸光，自已的憑籍已經沒有，還說得上共存嗎。</p>
<p>重慶方面各位將士，各位同志，各位同胞，以各位現在的處境和心情，我實在不願意多說話。然而為着國家民族的安危，為着東亞的前途，不能不說。我所說的都是現實的局勢，沒有半點可以引起爭辯的空論。我不知是高調是低調，高調低調的空諭，都是無補於實際的，我祗有深深期望大家認繼時局的嚴重，認識戰爭的發展，認識自已的祖國，認識隣邦的日本，認識共同的東亞，認識日本的力量，認識日本的眞義，認識我們自已所應該爭取的自主的出路。（完）昨林部長廣播詞文中所漏字句，補誌於下：為禮國（嗎他們心理早就明自這樣的「抗戰」變了　的抗戰。）又討論局勢的（險意），又通貨（募）伕役等，又陰謀百（出），又又要（用兵呢。）（中央社）</p>

<h3 id="c13">昨第七次防空日　舉行各項訓練　全市情緒頗為緊張熱烈 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>昨（九）日為第七次防空日，日陸海軍防空司令部暨上海市民防空本部，為使民衆熱練各項防空措置，舉行各種防空訓練，茲將詳情分記如後：</p>
<p>警戒警報情緒緊張</p>
<p>於昨日淸晨起，全市各區滿佈警戒繩索，商店居戶均於門口堆置黃沙蘆蓆水桶鐵鈎等防空用具，各保甲防空人員全體出動，集中於保甲辦事處，作各項準備，全市入於防空狀態。於十時正發出第一次警戒警報，至十時三十分解除，至下午三時發出第二次警戒警報，至三時半解除。在警戒警報中，由各該警察分局出動警察及保田人員指揮行人向左行走，五分種，再行行駛。防空本部派有特別取締班，在各區檢查車輛響音器具，不適宜者常即糾正，同時日機起飛，翱翔高空視察，全滬情緒甚為緊張。</p>
<p>交通管制尙欠完善</p>
<p>當於二次讐戒警報時，對交通管制依照常局親定辦法，必須於警報發出後行人隨即於兩街路旁靜待排列，須俟車輛及行人排定後，再經過五分鐘，始可開始交通。經記者巡視各處，仍有若千處聞得警報後，行人亂跑，車輛開快，似乎尙欠完善，　局與保甲當局應予糾正改善。</p>
<p>三次警報燈火管制</p>
<p>於晚間九時發出第三次警戒警報，除仍依照前法實施交通管制及車輛音響管制外，並實施燈火管制，由防空本部特別取締班會同各該管警察分局警察偕各保甲人員，巡查各里衡住戶燈光之洩及各種車輛避光减光器之設備，對不完善者，予以糾正，故意遠犯燈光管制者，抄錄門牌及戶長市民證，依照當局公佈辦法，從嚴懲處，故成績比往次良佳。日機亦高飛，巡視全市各區，至十時三十分始告解除。又於昨日全市各膩分別舉行各種防空訓練，各工廠大廈之特設防證團，亦有是項防空訓練，成績均比以往為佳。</p>

<p>米糧統制委員會自七月一日起，以最高價每石三千二百元之規定，實施征購後，米價刺激上漲，該會七月七日起又對於搬米五斗者，亦一律征購。購入數量略有增加，但次日又復低落如故。聞邇日各產米地區除崇明，新港，霍家橋等處仍維持原有市價，及浙路一帶，因浙江省政府通令所屬對米糧過境及遇有米統會護照之米糧不許藉故留難非法勒索，運輪較為便利，一般米阪為逃避征購，大都化整為零，荷負入市，然與實需數額相差懸殊。茲探悉市府當局鑒於目下情勢之嚴重，特於八日函請米統會，對十石以下搬入之米糧，免予征購之議，此舉如能實現，衆信來源必見暢旺，米價亦隨之下降云。</p>

<p>市長祝詞</p>
<p>各位印度同志：貴國獨立聯盟本部成立已屆週年，正當全東亞民族同表慶祝之際，在上海的自由印度義勇軍訓練所，又於本日舉行開學典禮，更使本人感到異常的興奮。</p>
<p>印度抗英已有深長的歷史，也積有充分的經騐，因此獨立聯盟本部成立之後，貴國志士開赴前綫的都能勇猛克敵，建立奇功，一年以來，在貴國志士奮戰之下，已越進國境，克復一部份失地，並且已成立臨時政府，在鮑斯主席領導之下，展開更轟烈的反英戰鬬和更廣大的獨立運動。</p>
<p>中國站在盟邦的立塲，自當竭盡棉力，協助貴國的獨立運動，因吾人深信印度的獲得獨立解放，也即是東亞民族的獲得自由解放，印度獨立遝動是與東亞各國尤其是與中國的革命運動息息相關的。</p>
<p>各位同志本日開始受訓，自然都能認眞學習，受訓完畢之後，也正是各位武裝起來，實踐獨立運動的時候，各位的賣任是非常重大的。同時各位所應受的榮譽也是極大的，本人僅祝各位學業猛進，並祝貴國獨立完成。最後祝十萬萬東亞同胞早獲解放，共享自由平等幸福的生活。」</p>
<p>宇佐美詞</p>
<p>「自由印度臨時政府主席鮑斯氏，在去年六月於世界之注視中出現於東亞之一偶，前後一年來，組織印度獨立聯盟，成立印度獨立臨時政府，以及印度國民軍之誕生，與印度解放之實踐運動，正在划時期之進展。尤其今春，日印同盟軍之進入印度領內者，乃歷百年之印度獨立運動，已突入其最後之門爭，大東亞十億同胞一致衷心予以聲援，且誓予以一切之協力，此蓋因中華民國之宣戰統一與印度獨立之達成，乃為大東亞解放之二大支柱故也。且實不外出於同志之愛而不能自已耳。當斯時也，今又僑滬印度義勇軍訓練所舉行行開所式，洵不勝意義深長之銘感。</p>
<p>鮑斯主席當臨時政府成立之際，曾宣誓稱：「余迄至臨終之一剎那以前，進守印度解放之誓約，余傾一切之努力，為印度國民獲得自由，余縱在印度解放之時，亦誓為印度貢獻一身。」訓練生諸君，當以飽斯主席之宣誓為宣誓，從事猛烈訓練，且相信累積各種訓練之後，相率參加馳聘於此偉大指導者之前，挺身於獨立運動之前綫，吾人與諸君為同志，衷心祈禱，努力奮鬥，聊陳徵悃，謹致祝詞。」</p>

<p>巴亨團長發表感想</p>
<p>緬甸特別調查團長巴亨博士下午五時半，接見日記者團，發表感想如次：余在動身之前，不知日本曾如何準備以應付大東亞戰爭，故余抵日時，即視察日軍需工塲，結果使余深信日木確能應付大東亞戰爭，更使余感動者，與其謂為工塲能出產多少物品，不如謂其職長職工，均測團結一致，國民團結力及突破困難之精力，如英美之為金錢而工作，因工資不足而怠工之劣根性，在日本全不看見。由此余已認職此種精神力，使日本軍事生產力有驚人之增强。尙有一點，即八紘一宇之精神，已普及全國內，而對其國民之尊崇皇室齊一步調之現實，不得不感動。</p>
<p>滿國建設</p>
<p>關於滿洲國一言以薇之，滿洲國為新時代之模範國家，僅於十二年之內，即將建國當初之治安混亂情況整頓，而成有秩序之國家，足資吾人借鏡者良多，豐富之埋藏資源，於十二年之短期內，急速開發，以為大東亞戰爭力增强之一助，滿洲國能如此奮發，而成近代之新興國家，誠使吾人驚歎稱讚不已，今日所開發之資源，僅不過只已奠定基礎而已。</p>
<p>滿洲國將來之發展，實未可限量，尤使吾人感佩者，即各民族相處均異常融合，處於指導立塲之日人，決無英美人施敎使役奴隷之態度，滿洲國人於另一方面，亦極甘心協力，吾人確信此點尤足為進一步使此國家向模範國家之途推進之一原動力。</p>
<p>中國復興</p>
<p>關於中國，今日之中國於建設方面有較滿洲國所具困難較多之處雖藏有不遜於滿洲國之　富地下資源，然不幸以有為英美利用之渝方存在使大東亞戰爭與大東來民族俱樂不利，同時更阻碍了國建設之進行。然余深信中國於將來時機到來時，勤勉之中國人，必能發揮其傳統之精神，開發資源以向復興與建設之途　進而得成為大東亞民族之中堅。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Increasing Education Funding <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The increase in tuition fees for all levels of schools starting next semester has already been decided. The amount of tuition is "said to be based on the rice price in August, a certain amount of斗 for elementary school, a certain amount of 斗 for middle school, and a certain amount of 斗 for university. Looking at the current situation of rice grain control and purchase, stabilizing rice prices is certainly impossible, and the amount purchased is extremely small, which is not good for the country or the people. However, the black market rice price has instead increased. If this situation continues, imagine what the rice price will be in August, and what the tuition fees will be next semester. It is truly chilling. Countless people with aspirations to study but without the ability to pay can only sigh outside the school gates. Those who remain in school are only a small number of people who can afford to pay but do not necessarily have the ambition to study. The aristocracy of schools can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>The majority of common people do not have the opportunity to receive education. This is a loss for the nation, a loss for the country and the people, and a responsibility that the government should bear. At this critical moment, a wise government should, during this summer vacation, on the one hand, actively adjust schools, allowing those with substantial content to continue operating and immediately closing those without. On the other hand, it should increase subsidies for education funding, so that excellent teachers can have a stable life and poor students will not lose the opportunity to study. Officials in charge of education and finance, this is the only opportunity to serve the country and the nation, and to serve future generations. People born in a great era must do some great things, and the government in a great era has an inescapable duty.</p>
<p>Educating the people is the foundation of any country. All citizens have the right to be educated, and after receiving education, they all have the obligation to serve the country. Therefore, civilized countries mostly have compulsory and free elementary education, the so-called compulsory national education. For middle schools and universities, there are also public schools with extremely low fees, thus enabling outstanding children from poor families to pursue further studies. Why does the country do this? Because in this way, the next generation of citizens can be more excellent than the previous generation, and the next generation of the country and nation can be more advanced than the previous generation. Excellent citizens create progressive countries, and progressive countries can last forever. Unprogressive countries will inevitably decline. The strength of Japan and Germany is the result of excellent citizens and the achievement of emphasizing education. There are countless examples of countries becoming prosperous through education in world history.</p>
<p>Every penny the country spends on education is an extra foundation for the country and an extra boost of new strength for the next generation of citizens. The government should not allow the high commercialization of private educational institutions. While cracking down, it must also provide assistance. The government should not sit idly by and watch young people drop out of school without helping. It must find ways to provide relief. Supporting educational undertakings is a need for everyone, and increasing education funding is even more approved by everyone. Therefore, even if the government borrows money to increase education funding, it is just like parents borrowing money for their children's education, and there is the same urgent need.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch from a Japanese military base in the Central Pacific): Fierce hand-to-hand combat is now unfolding everywhere on Saipan Island. In response to this battle, Japanese artillery positions on Tinian Island bombarded Aslito Airfield on Saipan Island fiercely on the night of the 6th. Furthermore, Japanese air units also bombed enemy positions, airfields, and other locations on Saipan Island at dawn on the 8th. In particular, they accurately bombed enemy positions southwest of Mount Tapochau, even under resistance from enemy night fighters and intense artillery fire. Meanwhile, late at night on the 6th, Japanese air units launched a fierce attack on enemy cruiser and destroyer groups southeast of Saipan Island.</p>
<p>Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): On the 6th, around 50 enemy carrier-based planes attacked Omiya Island. Local Japanese forces shot down 6 of them, repelling the attack. On the 7th, approximately 70 more enemy planes attacked, and 8 were shot down. Japanese losses during these two days were minimal.</p>

In South China, Japanese troops suddenly launched a northward attack on June 27, and successively captured key points such as Longhua Market, Longmen, Conghua, and Qingyuan between July 1st and 4th. Another unit occupied Xinning Qian, a strategic point of Heng Keshan, on June 29th. Furthermore, Japanese troops dispatched from Shanghai attacked Quzhou. After completing their objective, they returned to their original state. The results of the battle up to the 2nd are as follows: Japanese troops recovered 5,080 corpses of Chongqing troops, captured 664 prisoners, seized 25 artillery pieces, 131 heavy and light machine guns, 330 rifles, and a large amount of ammunition. In addition, the Japanese Air Force launched several sudden attacks on Zhijiang, southwest of Chaonan, on the 3rd, destroying 6 enemy planes on the ground and damaging 3. Another team of Japanese planes bombed Changde. On the 4th, they launched a surprise attack on Badong in Sichuan and Xi'an in Shaanxi. On the 8th, more than ten enemy planes flying from China intruded into western Kyushu. However, due to the Japanese air defense array, the enemy failed to achieve their aim and fled.</p>
<p>Burma Front</p>
<p>Enemy troops, in order to open up the Kohima Highway, brought in supplies and attacked desperately. On June 23, the Japanese army secured all key points at the 5797 Highlands east of Mytkyina. Furthermore, the Japanese troops guarding the key points southwest of Bishenpur inflicted heavy damage on the attacking enemy. (In the Bailel area) Japanese troops secured the northeastern highlands and repelled the counterattacking enemy troops. Enemy troops in the Mytkyina area began a counterattack on the evening of June 28, but the Japanese troops inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. Also, in late June, enemy planes attacked Thailand and Vietnam twenty-one times, with a total of thirty planes.</p>
<p>South Pacific</p>
<p>Although the key stronghold of Biak Island was occupied by the enemy, Japanese troops charged into the enemy's position with a small force. On the 2nd, under the protection of heavy enemy naval guns and aircraft, the enemy landed on Bombay Island. The western part of Biak Island seems to have been occupied by the enemy. In Rabaul, Solomon Islands, from June 29 to July 5, a cumulative total of 588 enemy planes attacked. The Japanese defenders on the island maintained high morale and fiercely fought back against the enemy. During the same period, a cumulative total of 124 enemy planes attacked Kavieng, and a cumulative total of 26 enemy planes attacked the Buka area. From June 29 to July 5, the Japanese-held area in southern Bougainville Island was attacked by a cumulative total of 289 enemy planes.</p>
<p>Central Pacific</p>
<p>The land battle on Saipan Island is currently raging in the Garapan Tapochau area. According to the Japanese headquarters announcement on the 6th, the enemy, under the cover of aircraft, warships, and artillery fire, invaded Japanese-held territory. The Japanese Air Force, responding to the valiant fighting of the ground forces on Saipan Island, has been bombing enemy warships and transport convoys cruising in the waters near the enemy's positions on the island for days. From June 20 to 30, the confirmed results of the battle include the sinking of 1 enemy battleship, 3 cruisers, 2 destroyers, and 2 transport ships; the destruction of 2 aircraft carriers, 2 destroyers, and 5 transport ships; and the shooting down of 211 enemy planes. Currently, a strong enemy fleet is still cruising in the Mariana Sea. Moreover, there is a mobile unit centered on makeshift aircraft carriers operating near the sulfur mining island of Iwo Jima in the Ogasawara Islands and near Omiya Island. The enemy often attacks with large aircraft. The Japanese Air Force bombed enemy positions on Saipan Island fiercely, causing fires at two locations near the airfield. On the night of the 1st, they bombed Aslito Airfield, destroying 5 enemy planes. Also, a Japanese reconnaissance plane discovered an enemy submarine in the waters west of the Mariana Islands during daylight on the 1st and bombed it. Currently, the enemy air force is intensifying its bombing of Aslito Airfield, gradually increasing its strength. The situation on the island has become serious. Along with the changes in the battle situation on Saipan Island, the activities of enemy mobile units have become increasingly active. On the 1st, they attacked Tinian, Omiya Island, and Rota Island with 50 to 70 planes. On the 3rd, several enemy cruisers attacked Omiya Island and shelled it, and 30 planes bombed the island. Around the same time, about 10 enemy planes attacked Rota Island. An enemy mobile unit appeared in the waters near Iwo Jima on the 3rd and engaged in combat with Japanese forces for two days. Also, a cumulative total of hundreds of enemy planes attacked Iwo Jima, and several enemy cruisers and destroyers shelled the island.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Rainy Season Defense and Offense on the India-Burma Front <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The India-Burma front has entered the true rainy season. At present, the Japanese army is continuing its superhuman "offensive without a rainy season" on various fronts, braving thunder and torrential rain. Recent news from the front lines indicates that hand-to-hand combat is taking place continuously for every inch of land. Therefore, while the war appears to be in a stalemate on the surface, fierce defensive and offensive battles are actually unfolding.</p>
<p>Just in terms of the rainy season, the rainy season on the border now is very different from our mainland's "plum rain." However, the start of the rainy season varies somewhat in time. The area around Imphal, which has now become a decisive battlefield, entered the rainy season from the end of April this year, and the area around Fort White from the beginning of May. Every year from then until the end of October, they are trapped by constant heavy rain for the length of the lunar year.</p>
<p>From then on, the amount of rain falling in a single day can often equal one-third of the annual rainfall in Japan. Bridges and roads are washed away. Engineering teams challenge the turbid currents, wading up to their waists in the mud. The bodies of the trucks slide. First-line supplies are carried out in this situation.</p>
<p>The planting of rice seedlings in Rangoon-Mergui at this time may be suitable for plants, but for human life, it is truly unbearably bad. The general temperature is 32 to 37 degrees Celsius. When the rain subsides slightly and one puts on a military uniform, the clothes have already grown bugs. Injuries, cholera, dysentery, fever, and various epidemics are endless. Airfields turn into a vast expanse of water, and the number of planes gradually decreases.</p>
<p>In the past, battles in this area, once the rainy season began, would no longer be actively offensive, but this time is an exception, with the launch of a rainy season offensive. Because the enemy's attempt to open up the Kohima-Imphal highway has not been successful, they are relying on their large amount of supplies and the cover of a strong air force to carry out a counteroffensive against the strong air force outposts. The Japanese army is meeting them everywhere, and the enemy has not succeeded. The enemy on the Bailel front is using the natural hazards of the terrain and launching desperate counterattacks from fortified positions, especially attempting to strike the Japanese army's flanks from near the Kognoma-Nungshigum crossroads. The elite Japanese troops, braving all kinds of hardships, are repeatedly conducting human-bullet night raids. In recent days, the enemy's main force has quietly retreated.</p>
<p>Once the rainy season enters the Bishenpur area, the enemy's air transport capacity into the Imphal plains decreases. In this air space, the enemy is gradually feeling the pressure. The Buyit area is also suffering from the disaster of the rainy season. The enemy is using airborne units to drop new American-style Chongqing troops to desperately reinforce the New First Army, which is on the verge of being isolated in the area, and is trying to establish communication with the Chongqing Expeditionary Force crossing the Nu River. In the Mytkyina area, the enemy is attempting to reinforce with new sharp troops to reverse the decline. The Japanese side is also gradually increasing new sharp units, and hand-to-hand combat will soon unfold.</p>
<p>In short, the stalemate seen on each front is actually a characteristic of rainy season warfare caused by the obstruction of harsh natural conditions. The enemy, the British and Americans, are disregarding these harsh conditions. They are still determined to recapture northern Burma and open up the Ledo Road. Recently, they have been treating the India-Burma front and the Pacific front equally, replenishing fighter planes, artillery pieces, tanks, and combatants. Near Kohima, as many as 5,000 artillery shells are fired in a single day. According to enemy broadcasts, "The anti-Japanese forces are attacking the Japanese army fiercely in the rainy season, turning into an unexpected bloody battle," admitting the difficulty of the operation.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the rainy season defense and offense on the India-Burma front not only truly reflects the depth of the current war situation, but also, because this battle requires overcoming harsh natural conditions in order to carry out operations, it has a great influence on the current situation of the East Asian war.

<p>Japanese military base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): On the night of the 7th, a squadron of Japanese Air Force bombers bombed the forward base of the Chongqing-US Air Force, Ganzhou Airfield, and Xincheng Airfield, 25 kilometers east of Ganzhou, inflicting heavy damage. The squadron bombing Ganzhou Airfield, amid intense artillery fire from the Chongqing-US forces, fiercely bombed the gliding runways and shelters of the airfield, destroying two fighter planes, damaging five fighter planes, and damaging one large bomber. In addition, they also destroyed many military facilities. Furthermore, the squadron of Japanese planes that attacked Xincheng Airfield bombed its gliding runways, rendering them unusable for a considerable period of time. In both of these operations, the Japanese planes returned to their defense safely.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Invade the Airspace of Lianyungang</p>
<p>Qingdao, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): At 1:30 AM on the 8th, an unidentified enemy plane intruded into the airspace of the Lianyungang area in Huaihai Province. Regarding this matter, the Qingdao Special Naval Base Headquarters announced the following: At 1:37 AM on the 8th, an unidentified enemy plane (three engines) invaded from the west and blindly bombed the Lianyungang area, dropping all its bombs into the sea. It fled at 1:55 AM. Local land facilities and city streets suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Attack Anqing Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Central China, Japanese dispatch, military base, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Three enemy B-25 bombers and four P-51 fighter planes attacked Anqing at around 12:30 PM on the 7th of this month. They were intercepted by Japanese army and navy air defense squadrons and were unsuccessful. Two enemy fighter planes were shot down (one of which has not yet been confirmed), and the rest escaped into the clouds. Japanese losses were minimal.</p>
<p>Results Achieved by Japanese Troops in Western Hebei</p>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army and the security forces in Hebei Province in the western Hebei area in June are as follows: Number of engagements: 57; total number of Communist bandits: 7,905; corpses collected: 355; prisoners captured: 291; seized rifles: 178; ammunition: 235; pistols: 10; ammunition: 126; hand grenades: 33; foreign cannons: 75; landmines: 69; destroyed facilities: 164.</p>
<p>The Defeat of Chongqing Troops Affects the Overall Situation</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army's offensive on the China front has had a great impact on the anti-Axis camp. According to a London dispatch, the British "New Statesman" weekly pointed out on the 8th that the defeat of the Chongqing troops has had a great impact on the war situation. The gist of it is that the Chongqing troops hardly resisted. In the current new operation launched by the Japanese army along the Yuehan Railway, if the Japanese army's offensive continues at the current speed, then the Chinese mainland will soon be cut in two, and the Japanese army will be able to secure the land transportation line from Manchuria to South China. Once Hengyang falls, the forward base of the anti-Axis air force will be lost, and the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing will not be able to continue to provide effective assistance to Chongqing.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Chongqing Army and People Deeply Moved by Sino-Japanese Statement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Hankou, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch from Chongqing): Since the Chinese and Japanese governments simultaneously issued statements, the entire army and people were deeply moved after the news reached Chongqing. The Chongqing army and people had long been doubtful about the blind resistance, especially regarding the various atrocities committed by the British and American troops in Chongqing, which were even more infuriating. The Sino-Japanese statement declared that the common target of combat was to destroy the ambitions of the British and Americans to dominate East Asia, not to annex China. Therefore, they deeply realized that those who were truly aggressing against China and East Asia were the British and Americans, not Japan. Therefore, the anti-war sentiment is currently extremely low. The atmosphere of peace is becoming increasingly strong in various places. They were especially encouraged by the statement issued by the National Government. The leaders of Chongqing were deeply disturbed by this situation and, despite their painstaking efforts to use their tricks, the people's desire for peace was overwhelming, and their sinister schemes only served to highlight their futile efforts.</p>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): The German military authorities announced that British troops had continuously shelled the city of Caen from the night of the 7th to the 8th, and the city has been reduced to ruins. It is generally believed that this shelling of Caen by the British troops is the prelude to a new offensive. British bomber squadrons also fiercely bombed German positions on both sides and south of Caen on the 7th.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Reuter's news agency reports that British and Canadian patrol teams and tank convoys advanced to the west bank of the Orne River in the center of Caen last night.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch): Since the British army began its new offensive in the Caen area, fierce battles have unfolded on the entire front line from Caen to La Haye-du-Puits in the western Cotentin Peninsula. The British Second Army in the Caen area has placed its emphasis on the semicircular front line seven miles west of the city and is currently continuing its fierce offensive with all its might. Meanwhile, German troops are repeatedly attacking with heavy weapons south and southwest of the city. Currently, the two armies are continuing a seesaw battle one and a half miles from the center of the city. Furthermore, near Saint-Lo, eight miles north of Caen, on the Carentan-Périers road, and in the city of La Haye-du-Puits, the offensive and defensive battles at the center of the war have gradually intensified. Furthermore, according to a report from a German staff officer, the anti-Axis forces' operational plans have been frustrated due to the fierce resistance of the German troops in the Normandy bridgehead on the 8th.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Lin Xuanzhang's Broadcast to Chongqing: "Striving for an Initiative-Taking Way Out" <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Continued) Not only that, but in Chongqing, there are also people like Lu Baiming who belong to the left wing. On the one hand, they unite with the Communist Party to foster opposition, and on the other hand, they entice Mr. Chiang to accept so-called democratic demands. However, in the Communist Party's strategic decisions, these people are only regarded as petty-bourgeois democrats, no different from the die-hard conservatives and reactionaries of the right wing. The Communist Party itself has made it clear that it will never again be a song and dance troupe for opportunists, but will only use these opportunists as temporary allies in the anti-Chiang struggle. Once there is an opportunity, after the struggle, they must immediately put forward their own demands. From the very beginning, distrust should not be placed on the reactionary parties that have been overthrown. On the contrary, it should be placed on the comrades who have always united with them. I wonder what these so-called left-wing opportunists think of these original resolutions. When we read them, we really feel sorry for them.</p>
<p>War is an extension of politics. When a war breaks out, no one is willing to say that it is for the sake of war. They always want to raise a political banner to call for support, but in fact, it is very ridiculous. For example, Britain and the United States are fighting under the banner of democracy, claiming to be anti-fascist. However, because of the war, the internal political institutions and economic systems of Britain and the United States have been conquered by fascism step by step, losing the spirit of democracy. Roosevelt and Churchill are calling out every day. Those Americans and British who love freedom and democracy are fighting against Hitler and Mussolini, who are fascists. If Americans and British truly love freedom and democracy, shouldn't they quickly rise up and overthrow Roosevelt and Churchill, who are becoming fascists? To give another example, the Soviet Union is fighting against fascism under the banner of communism. Again, once the war started, the Third International was abolished, and the Internationale was also abolished, replaced by a new Soviet national anthem to replace the Internationale. The Internationale is the song most loved by the Chinese Communist Party. I don't know if they can still sing this new song. Inside, it is full of the motherland's freedom and independence, without a single word about communism or the proletariat. It seems that fascism has not been overthrown, and communism is no longer needed. As for our China, ten years of suppressing the Communists have resulted in the situation we have today. The longer the war drags on, the more powerful the Communist Party becomes. How can we clean up the mess in the end?</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Chiang is not unaware of the difficulties of continuing the war and the unreliability of Britain and the United States, but he has reached a point of no return. He is in a dilemma, and has no other choice but to let others control him and continue the war. We believe that this is of course a blow from the failure of tailism. Such plans will only become deeper and deeper, and the deeper they go, the more difficult it will be to extricate themselves. To extricate themselves, they must immediately recognize the trap of Britain and the United States and strive to take the initiative. Now there is a clear and bright road to save China and protect East Asia. Why abandon it and instead willingly fall into the trap of Britain and the United States and bind themselves?</p>
<p>It is also said that Mr. Chiang is not unwilling to seek peace, but he also believes that a third party is needed to guarantee it. We must raise three points here, hoping that Chongqing will pay attention to them. First, there have been too many painful experiences in diplomatic history over the decades with this so-called third-party guarantee method. Second, the relationship between China and Japan is a matter for the two major nations of China and Japan, and the handling of the East Asian situation is a matter for the East Asian nations. Why should we be at the mercy of others? Third, the greatest guarantee of peace and friendship is, first, sincerity, and second, strength. Only when both sides show sincerity and establish the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity, and also show strength to maintain this principle, can there be a great guarantee. One's own destiny, the most reliable thing is one's own sincerity and one's own strength. The most reliable thing about a common destiny is also common sincerity and common strength. So-called sincerity is relative, not one-sided. If one wants to rely on others, it is nothing more than trickery and tactics. So-called strength, Japan's strength, Japan's strength is not only the strength to protect Japan, but also the strength to protect East Asia, which no one can deny. This strength should be cherished. We, too, must have the strength to do our part in order to be qualified to share responsibility, and this strength should also be cherished. If we lose even this little capital, and we have no basis of our own, how can we talk about co-existence?</p>
<p>Fellow generals, comrades, and compatriots in Chongqing, given your current situation and mood, I really don't want to say much. However, for the sake of the safety of the country and the nation, and for the future of East Asia, I must speak. What I have said are all realistic situations, without a single point that can cause debate. I don't know if it's high-sounding or low-key. High-sounding and low-key theories are of no help to reality. I only deeply hope that everyone recognizes the seriousness of the current situation, recognizes the development of the war, recognizes their own motherland, recognizes neighboring Japan, recognizes common East Asia, recognizes Japan's strength, recognizes the true meaning of Japan, and recognizes the independent way out that we should strive for.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Central News Agency) The Eastern Front battle situation, centered on the areas of Kovel, Baranavichy, Vilnius, along the Vilnius-Daugavpils railway, and the five main battle areas of Daugavpils-Pskov, has become increasingly intense. The battle situation in each area is added as follows: In the Kovel area, according to German sources, Soviet troops attacked German positions along the Bug River west of Kovel with five divisions of riflemen and one group of tanks, but failed. German troops have withdrawn from the city of Baranavichy (an important railway hub southwest of Minsk, within the old Polish border). However, Soviet troops are aiming their offensive at the cities of Bialystok and Brest-Litovsk and are continuing to fight fiercely west of Baranavichy. In the Vilnius area, the greatest focus of the Soviet offensive is the city of Vilnius. According to the latest news, street fighting is continuing in the city. According to German estimates, the Soviet forces in the area consist of seven motorized rifle divisions and four tank groups. Along the Vilnius-Daugavpils railway, although Soviet troops have worked hard to cut off the railway, according to German front-line news, German troops are fighting bravely along the railway, and Soviet troops have not yet succeeded. German authorities claim that German troops on the Southern Front have retreated to the west of the Pripyat River.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Yesterday was the 7th Air Defense Day; Various Drills Held; City's Mood Quite Tense and Enthusiastic <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday (9th) was the seventh Air Defense Day. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command and the Shanghai Municipal Civil Air Defense Headquarters held various air defense drills to make the public proficient in various air defense measures. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Tense Mood for Warning and Alarm</p>
<p>From early yesterday morning, warning ropes were spread throughout the city, and shops and residents piled up yellow sand, reed mats, water buckets, iron hooks, and other air defense equipment at their doors. All the Baojia air defense personnel were mobilized and concentrated at the Baojia office to make various preparations. The entire city entered a state of air defense. The first warning alarm was issued at 10:00 a.m. and lifted at 10:30 a.m. The second warning alarm was issued at 3:00 p.m. and lifted at 3:30 p.m. During the warning alarms, police officers and Baojia personnel from the police sub-bureaus directed pedestrians to walk to the left for five minutes before resuming travel. The Air Defense Headquarters sent special inspection teams to check the sound-making equipment of vehicles in various areas. Inappropriate equipment was corrected immediately. At the same time, Japanese planes took off and soared in the sky to inspect. The entire city was in a tense mood.</p>
<p>Traffic Control Still Needs Improvement</p>
<p>During the two warning alarms, traffic control was carried out in accordance with the methods personally set by the authorities. After the alarm was issued, pedestrians had to wait quietly in a line on the sides of the streets. Traffic could only begin five minutes after vehicles and pedestrians were lined up. According to reporters' inspections in various places, there were still some places where pedestrians ran around and vehicles drove fast after hearing the alarm. It seems that this still needs improvement. The authorities and Baojia authorities should correct and improve this.</p>
<p>Three Alarms and Blackout</p>
<p>The third warning alarm was issued at 9:00 p.m. In addition to implementing traffic control and vehicle sound control in accordance with the previous methods, a blackout was also implemented. Special inspection teams from the Air Defense Headquarters, together with police officers from the police sub-bureaus and Baojia personnel, inspected the light leaks in the houses in each neighborhood and the light shielding and dimming equipment of various vehicles. Those who were not perfect were corrected. Those who deliberately violated the blackout regulations had their house numbers and household head citizen certificates recorded and severely punished in accordance with the methods announced by the authorities. Therefore, the results were better than in the past. Japanese planes also flew high to inspect various areas of the city, and the alarm was lifted at 10:30 p.m. In addition, various air defense drills were held in various neighborhoods of the city yesterday. The special air defense groups of various factories and buildings also had these air defense drills. The results were better than in the past.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Rice Below 10 Shi Should be Exempt from Compulsory Purchase; City Government Suggested to Rice Control Committee Yesterday <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since the Rice Control Committee implemented the compulsory purchase policy on July 1st at a maximum price of 3,200 yuan per shi, rice prices have been stimulated and risen. On July 7th, the committee also compulsorily purchased rice from anyone transporting five dou of rice. The amount purchased has increased slightly, but it has fallen back to the same level the next day. It is reported that in the rice-producing areas, except for Chongming, Xingang, Huojiaqiao, and other places that still maintain the original market price, and the area along the Zhejiang railway, because the Zhejiang Provincial Government ordered its subordinates not to make excuses to detain or illegally extort rice that passed through the border and had passports from the Rice Control Committee, transportation was more convenient. In general, rice merchants, in order to escape compulsory purchase, mostly broke up the rice into smaller amounts and carried it into the market, but this was far from the actual demand. It has been learned that the city government authorities, in view of the seriousness of the current situation, specially sent a letter to the Rice Control Committee on the 8th, suggesting that rice transported in amounts below ten shi should be exempt from compulsory purchase. If this measure can be realized, it is believed that the sources of supply will become abundant and rice prices will also fall accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Grain Protection Patrol Team Working Smoothly <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, the Commander of the Shanghai Special City Security Command, in order to be concerned about the people's food supply, specially ordered the Special Task Force of the Security Department on the 4th of this month to organize a grain patrol team, with Zhang Duo, the Deputy Captain of the Special Task Force, as the captain. The team has been carrying out patrol work for many days. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter specially visited Captain Zhang. According to Zhang, the main task of the team is to protect rice and grain and prevent local thugs, ruffians, and unscrupulous civil servants and troops from extorting money. This was clearly stipulated in the plan for the establishment of the team in the department. In order to clarify the work objectives and provide guidance, it is hereby stipulated that if any of the above-mentioned bad elements use excuses to extort money from rice-transporting villagers, and the prevention is ineffective, they should be arrested immediately and handed over to the law for handling, in order to curb greed and achieve the purpose of protecting the transport of rice and grain. Since the implementation of patrol and grain protection work, extortion along the way has decreased day by day, and the results are satisfactory. However, recently, in the area of the West Railway Station and Xujiahui Station in western Shanghai, due to special circumstances, there are still abnormal extortion activities. We are currently paying more attention to this, and once it is found out, we will arrest them impartially and strictly. In order to ensure that the people have no worries about food and to ensure public security, we hope that all agencies will assist the team so that the government's policy can be completed as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Free India National Army Training Institute held an opening ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Racecourse yesterday (9th) afternoon. All the trainees of the institute entered the camp for training on the 15th of the previous month and have been training for more than two months. Under the leadership of Captain Naren, they have been actively trained in various special techniques every day, and the results have been outstanding. Among the Indians who attended were Qut, the head of the Shanghai branch of the Indian Independence League, Gao Li, the propaganda director, Captain Naren, the commander of the training institute, and more than 2,000 Indians from the city. Representatives from various countries included Pan Da, the city government counselor representing Mayor Chen from China, Minister Usami representing Information Minister Matsudaira from Japan, Fleet News Minister Matsushima, Army News Minister Izubuchi, Consul Biz of Germany, Changfu Kawashima, the consul of Manchukuo in Shanghai, and Kasino from the Philippines.</p>
<p>The ceremony was held at 3:30 p.m. The band of the First Police Bureau played music, and the Free India National Army performed various exercises. The steps were very neat, the spirit was full, and the mood was enthusiastic, which won a lot of applause. At 3:50 p.m., Captain Naren gave a speech, which was full of encouragement, about calling on all Indians to unite and be a backing for the Free India National Army, work hard for the country, march towards New Delhi, and win victory. Then, Pan Da, representing Mayor Chen, and Matsudaira, representing Minister Usami, were invited to give congratulatory speeches. The ceremony ended at about 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Mayor's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>"Dear Indian comrades: The headquarters of your country's Independence League has been established for a year. Just as all the nations of East Asia are celebrating, the opening ceremony of the Free India Volunteer Army Training Institute in Shanghai today makes me feel exceptionally excited.</p>
<p>India's resistance to Britain has a long history and has accumulated sufficient experience. Therefore, after the establishment of the Independence League headquarters, the patriots of your country who went to the front line have been brave and overcome the enemy, establishing extraordinary feats. In the past year, under the hard work of the patriots of your country, they have advanced into the country, recovered part of the lost land, and established a provisional government. Under the leadership of Chairman Bose, they have launched a more vigorous anti-British war and a broader independence movement.</p>
<p>China, standing in the position of an allied country, should do its best to assist the independence movement of your country, because we firmly believe that India's achievement of independence and liberation is also the achievement of freedom and liberation for the nations of East Asia. India's independence movement is closely related to the revolutionary movements of various East Asian countries, especially China.</p>
<p>Comrades, you will begin training today, and you will naturally be able to study seriously. After completing the training, it will be time for you to arm yourselves and put the independence movement into practice. Your responsibilities are very great. At the same time, the honor you deserve is also great. I wish you all a rapid progress in your studies, and I wish your country's independence to be completed. Finally, I wish the 1 billion East Asian compatriots to be liberated soon and share a life of freedom, equality, and happiness."</p>
<p>Usami's Speech</p>
<p>"Chairman Bose of the Free India Provisional Government appeared in a corner of East Asia last June under the world's attention. In the year since then, the organization of the Indian Independence League, the establishment of the Indian Independence Provisional Government, and the birth of the Indian National Army, and the practical movement for Indian liberation, are making epoch-making progress. Especially this spring, the entry of the Japan-India Allied Forces into Indian territory is the century-long Indian independence movement that has broken into its final stage. One billion East Asian compatriots unanimously express their heartfelt support and pledge to give all their cooperation. This is because the declaration of unification of the Republic of China and the achievement of Indian independence are the two major pillars of East Asian liberation. And it is really impossible to refrain from the love of comrades. At this time, the Shanghai Indian Volunteer Army Training Institute is holding an opening ceremony, which is truly an unforgettable and deeply meaningful event.</p>
<p>Chairman Bose once swore at the establishment of the Provisional Government: 'I will keep the oath of liberating India until the last moment of my life. I will devote all my efforts to the freedom of the Indian people. Even at the time of India's liberation, I also vow to contribute my life to India.' Trainees, take Chairman Bose's oath as your own, engage in vigorous training, and believe that after accumulating various training, you will all participate in the front lines of the independent movement, leading the way for this great leader. We are comrades of you, and we sincerely pray, work hard, and strive to do our best. With this presentation, I respectfully offer my congratulations."</p>

<p>Since the implementation of the queuing system for boarding streetcars, the phenomenon of crowding and jostling has been eliminated. It has been learned that the pull bells installed on the platforms of various streetcar lines, which were used by ticket sellers to notify the driver that people could start driving, have been removed and replaced with whistle notifications. Therefore, the general public should be careful when getting on or off the streetcar in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Myanmar Special Investigation Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Nanjing; Visited Various Chinese and Japanese Authorities in the City <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>The Myanmar Special Investigation Group, in order to investigate the construction status and cultural undertakings of our country, arrived in Shanghai yesterday (9th) morning by plane from Nanjing with a party of six, led by Dr. Pa Ning, the country's fear. Those who went to welcome them from the city government included Wu Songbi, the Secretary-General of the City Government, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the Propaganda Department, Zheng Wukui, the Section Chief of the First Section, and senior city government officials. From the Allied side, Izubuchi, the Army News Minister, Matsushima, the Fleet News Minister, and Matsudaira, the News Minister of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, were present. At 10:20 a.m., the special plane of the Myanmar Special Investigation Group landed at the airport amidst the resounding military music of the city government band. After the six members of the group disembarked, Group Leader Dr. Ba Henge shook hands with Secretary-General Wu as a greeting, and introduced the members of the group to meet Secretary-General Wu separately. Then, the welcoming personnel shook hands with the group members as a greeting. The whole group then walked out of the airport under the leadership of Secretary-General Wu, and were escorted by Chen Gongzhan, Lian Desheng, and other representatives of the city government in limousines to the Hua Mao Hotel for rest.</p>
<p>Luncheon Reception</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon, Liang Xiuyu, the Director of the City Propaganda Department, and Matsudaira, the News Minister of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office, jointly hosted a luncheon at the 9th floor of the Hua Mao Hotel to welcome them. During the meal, everyone raised their glasses and chatted happily. The party ended at about 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Visit to the Mayor</p>
<p>At 2:30 p.m., the group, led by Group Leader Dr. Ba Henge, visited the Mayor at the City Hall. Secretary-General Wu Songbi received them. After leaving at 3:00 p.m., they rested briefly. At 4:10 p.m., they visited Minister Usami at the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office. The mood was very harmonious at 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Impressions of Group Leader Ba Henge</p>
<p>Dr. Ba Henge, the leader of the Myanmar Special Investigation Group, met with a group of Japanese reporters at 5:30 p.m. and expressed his impressions as follows: Before I set off, I didn't know how Japan had prepared to cope with the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, when I arrived in Japan, I inspected the Japanese military factories. As a result, I was deeply convinced that Japan could indeed cope with the Greater East Asia War. What moved me even more was that, rather than saying how many items the factory could produce, it was the fact that the chiefs and employees were all united. The national unity and the energy to overcome difficulties are not seen in the UK and the US, who work for money and slack off because of insufficient wages. From this, I have realized that this kind of spiritual strength makes Japan's military productivity have a surprising increase. One more point is that the spirit of Hakkō ichiu has been popularized throughout the country, and the fact that its people respect the imperial family in unison is inevitably moving.</p>
<p>Construction of Manchukuo</p>
<p>In a word about Manchukuo, Manchukuo is a model country for the new era. In just twelve years, it has rectified the chaotic security situation at the beginning of its establishment and become an orderly country. There are many things that we can learn from it. The rich buried resources have been rapidly developed in a short period of twelve years, which has helped to enhance the war effort of the Greater East Asia War. Manchukuo has been able to work so hard and become a modern emerging country, which has made us amazed and praised. The resources that have been developed today are only a foundation that has been laid.</p>
<p>The future development of Manchukuo is really limitless. What makes us even more admired is that all ethnic groups get along with each other exceptionally well. The Japanese people, who are in a guiding position, definitely do not have the attitude of the British and Americans who teach, employ, and enslave. The people of Manchukuo, on the other hand, are also very willing to cooperate. We firmly believe that this is especially a driving force to further promote this country to a model country.</p>
<p>Revival of China</p>
<p>Regarding China, today's China has more difficulties in construction than Manchukuo. Although it has rich underground resources that are not inferior to Manchukuo, unfortunately, there is the existence of the Chongqing side, which is used by the British and Americans, which is detrimental to the Greater East Asia War and the East Asian nations, and at the same time hinders the progress of national construction. However, I firmly believe that when the future opportunity arrives, the diligent Chinese people will be able to exert their traditional spirit, develop resources, and advance towards the road of revival and construction, and become the backbone of the East Asian nations.</p>
