<p>社評</p>
<h3>衛生事業的困難</h3>
<p>上月間東亞醫學會第三屆大會演講會巾，衛生署長薩潤芝講「衛生行政計劃及醫學教育問題」，提出現在舉辦公共衛生事業的困難點有三：　分成派別，不能精誠合　；　人才缺乏，不數需要；　經費年僅百藍萬元，不　應用。就此三點，提出若干管　。</p>
<p>我國新學界本無派派別，造成新醫　派別的原因，完全是英美殖民地式的教育。英美人在中國所舉辦的醫院和醫學院，至少後面都有商業式的推銷英美商品的目的，因此造出許多英美派德日派法比派等等名詞，利用經濟勢力，操縱醫界集團，包辦醫學事業。有一個時期，甚至利用政治勢力，希圖打倒一切而獨佔中國·有些盲目的中國人更附和着，利用着，而作爲個人升官發財的機會·中國衛生事業應該以中國人民爲立場，而過去中國衛生事業則每每帶有英美侵略意義，這是無可韓言的。自從大東亞戰爭發動以來，所有敵性的醫院和醫學院，大部都已交給中國政府管理，同時對於今後的各項課程，一律以木國語言講授。這樣，把根本英美侵略意義的原因去除了，國家延用人才更無分派別，以實學爲標準，其他醫界派別問題自然不復存在。醫學院術是世界的，本沒有派別，中國醫界人才爲中國民眾服務，自然都是一致的。</p>
<p>我國過去醫學人才已感缺乏，我們鑒於盟邦的特別注重醫學院教育，屢屢有所陳述。因爲談到公共衛生事業，談到醫療事業，假如人的問題沒有解決，其他一切簡直無從談起。醫學教育在目前是一個迫不及待的問題，衛生署和教育部必須聯合起來，訂定一個計劃，在數年內造成醫師多少人，護士多少人，而這些醫市和護士必須爲國家所用，不能為私人開業着像。同時對於現有的人才，要謀進修的方法，或在中央設立研究會，或派赴日本進修，由政府擔任一切費用，而規定必須爲國家服務。我們希望國家醫學教育機關的擴充和增加，受教育的人才不許僅僅爲個人生活利益着想，而以替老百姓做事為目的。這樣，國家培植一個人才，國家有一個人才的用處。</p>
<p>關於衛生署的經費問題，全國性的中央機關僅僅一百餘萬元。這個數目，在戰前己經不够，依據現在的購買力而論，恐怕連一個實騐室的設備還辦不起來。這點，我們深深以爲是國家的遺憾。戰爭時期，國家的人力和物力，最要保護和增進，保護人力的最要方法，就在公共衛生，因爲在戰爭時期，入民因疾病而死亡，每母多於因直接戰門而死亡。戰鬥是無法避免的，疾病是有法子消滅的，所以在戰爭時期，國家在後方做消滅疾病的工作，就足以增加前方戰鬥的力量，任何交戰國家都切實注意，盟邦日本更是一個先例。所以衛生署經費的增加，務必立刻實現，但是，衛生署的經費是要化在事業上，不要化在行政上，那末對於保讀國民生侖上才有切實的效力。</p>
<h3>伊姆法爾攻防戰　現正壯烈展開中　日機抵空轟炸砲兵陣地</h3>

<p>仰光十二中央社電　緬甸日空軍戰鬥機隊，十一日上午飛抵巴列爾上空，對盤據愛闌及薩巴姆地方之敵砲兵陣地，實行低空轟炸，予敵主力以潰滅之打擊。數小時後，於巴列爾上空與敵高速度機十架接觸，展開激烈空戰，擊落其中一架，敵機敗去。更於返防途中，發見企圖襲擊某基地之敵北美式轟炸機三架，予以追擊後，在謝堡西方十二公里之阿拉坎山中，擊落其一架，其中一架未證實，是役日機自炸一架。</p>
<p>里斯本十二日中央社電　東南亞洲反軸心軍司令部十一日發表戰况稱：日軍於巴列爾公路地區曾行攻擊，經反軸心軍猛烈抵抗後，已自該陣地撤退。並確認該地區日軍之優勢。</p>

<h3>印國民軍勇士　談參戰感想　與日軍爲友爭取解放</h3>
<p>抑光十二日中央社電　印度國民軍勇土，近於阿拉坎日軍某基地舉行座談會，記者會親聞彼筆潑表舊戰感想及遠六抱負，並會與之問答如下：</p>
<p>日軍巧妙戰術制勝問，國民軍諸君此次與日軍挺進隊協同作戰，經此共同生活後，對日·英兩軍之不同點，有何感覺？請A上尉發表意見。（A）英軍常以爲致勝典以及戰鬥基本原則做起，但日軍挺進隊戰門原貝，則不以此爲例，如保持以及通信連絡，均巧妙利之利器，但日軍因戰術之進步，故能常得生理，例如此次挺身隊作戰，即係首先堪破敵人弱點，再對敵人腹背施以　擊，因之出發不及兩天，即完成　大之使命。敵人后方基地以及通信速絡，也不出週而被完全切斷，經六天峻險山道之困難，終將敵人擊退。因之，日軍士氣更爲旺盛，英軍若與日軍相比，實如天淵之別·</p>
<p>不達目的絕不止戈參加此次作戰以後有何感想？（B）我國民軍上下，均深切了解解放之目的及其偉大，全體共誓不達到解放獨立目的，絕不止戈，我等視回歸後方乃一種恥辱。與日軍並肩作戰，此爲自次，日軍之崇高精神以及其堅固意志，實在衷心佩服。（C）日軍行軍之靜肅敏速，軍紀之嚴格以及其服從精神之偉大，最使人佩服，戰鬥時期，雖飲食中斷，其戰鬥精神亦稍不衰微，「犧牲小我，愛護國家，視死如歸」，此數言日軍當之無愧矣。（D）日軍官兵何時何地談笑之間，均帶幸福與愉快，其士氣亦此同，日軍當數日不得一餐，但對傷病兵之保護以及行軍作戰，仍與平時無異，且日軍更始終持有戰勝之自信。</p>
<p>保護傷兵應盡之責問，（D）中尉會於辛澤瓦作戰時看護多數日本侮病兵，受盡辛苦，完成偉大任務，請將當時情形及所感略作發表：（D）實無辛苦可言，日人爲大東亞之解放，不惜犧牲，轉戰各地，我印人爲祖國，爲大東亞祈求戰勝，保護日本傷病土兵，乃應盡之則，即此身戰死，亦可博得四億同胞之感謝。此實爲　大之事業，日本兵士雖身受創傷，但仍時程「到前綫區殺敵殺敵」，余對此實深感佩。問，大尉初次做指揮官，指揮國民軍時印象如何？（A）國民軍此次作戰，所遇困難，乃所預料者，故對任務之完成，非常擔心，結果能收得預期以上之成績，相信前途必有光明問，</p>
<p>犧牲小我既能獲勝問，參加此次作戰，是否認爲得到很多寶貴的經騐？（B）國民軍經此次戰門後，於精神上增强數倍，同時由日軍方面得到許多實貴經騐，吾人向以爲如無後方援助，實難完成作戰，但經此次作戰之後，遂將此種思想完全推翻，蓋軍隊非僅物質而戰鬥，尤重依仗精神。（D）敵人決無如此堅强之鬥志，蓋彼等一受打擊，即棄甲　兵，狼狽不堪，吾等即食糧斷絕，亦能如日軍同樣作戰，絕不因稍受打擊即沮喪鬥志。（G）余現已明白，無論指揮官或士兵，若肯犧牲小我，即能獲勝，例如此次作戰之幾次斷絕食糧，經相當忍耐，終於完成使命，此即最好一例。</p>
<p>勝利之神時在身旁（D）獨立國之兵士，只懂得殺身成仁，我等乃具有犧牲精神之獨立印度兵士，我等要與勇敢之日本兵士爲友，如不達勝利，我等將永遠有家歸不得，我相信，勝利之神時時在我等之身旁。</p>

<p>又中儲行就設有行處地方，視金融機關設置情形，暫時劃分故於款與不放款區域，其規定如下：　南京·上海·蘇州·杭州·無錫·常州·爲不做普通商業放款之區域。各同業間需要運用放款，而提供受押貨物作轉抵押者，其原貨主應爲正式商號，但各商號之押借限額，及押品種類，亦須嚴密審定。至生產放款，盡業田同業承做，向中備行轉押。倘非同業資力所得承貸者，亦得由中儲行暫時直接貸放之。　寗波·蚌埠·無湖·鎮江·常熟·揚州·泰縣·南通·安慶·嘉興·松江·太倉·崑山·硤石·紹與·餘姚·鎮海·爲暫時可做普通商業放款之區域，但亦不以放款於爲固定業務。除生產放款外，如必須承做商號押放，其各個商號押借限額，及押品種類，則仍須事先精密調查，經合理之審定，以杜囤積。　漢口·武昌·南昌·九江·廣州·　門·汕頭·徐州·海州·連雲港。宿縣·淮陰·非經特准。絕對不做放款云。</p>
<h3>日大笨應發表　華中各地戰况　戰事中心移伏牛山脈</h3>
<p>東京十二中央社電　日大本營十二日下午四時四十分發表：　華中方面日軍，五月一日自信陽附近發動攻勢，開始北進，至九日止，已與舉昔攻略許昌，正行南進中之華北方面日軍，取得述絡。　於平漢路西方地區作戰中之日軍，殲減洛塲東南方地區湯恩伯軍主力後，現正繼續進攻中。　本作戰開始後，迄五月六日止，判明之主要戰果如次：渝軍損害棄屍一九五〇〇具，俘虜四〇三一名，鹵獲各種大砲共入一門，及槍械約七〇〇〇挺。日方損害陣亡二一三名。</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　日軍十日會師於遂平駐馬店之間，開戰僅三週，洛陽至信陽間二一百餘里之鐵道，已全人日軍掌握。現鄭州洛陽等地區內之蔣軍，約有十萬至十五萬之多，然己四分五裂，號稱　將軍　下最箱銳部隊之湯恩伯軍，其抗戰力如此薄弱，頗使世人驚訝，斯亦重慶戰力低下之實證。民下戰事中心，已移至洛陽南方之伏牛山脈，敵主力在魯山一帶已開展壯烈戰鬥。渝方謂日軍此次作戰目的，在打開京漢綫，當茲洛陽已陷於包圍情勢之時，日軍精銳轉向何方，吾入可拭目以待云。</p>
<p>日軍佔領沿綫地域</p>
<p>新鄭十二日中央社電　華北日軍渡過黃河後，即以主力在平漢鐵路兩方地區伏牛山一帶，包國湯恩伯軍隊，展開一大殲滅戰。日軍另一有力部隊，急追隴海鐵路敗走渝軍，沿平漢鐵路南下，一舉渡過大小河川。四日傍晚，巳進迫郾域，該城駐有渝軍十九集團軍之入十九軍（顧錫九）所編第一師，及第五十集團何柱國麾下之騎兵第三師，計約共干人。敵以城外之穎水支流，爲唯一防禦，頑强抵抗。日軍由東方繞至渝軍之側而，五日晨加以猛攻，使受重創，即佔領該城。立刻由河南平原南下，迅速佔領渝軍騎兵第三師據守之遂平，更迅速南下，先鋒部隊於九日在確山與中方面日軍精銳會師，於是平模沿綫之八十公里地域，悉人日軍之當握。</p>

<p>渝方亟盼英美援助</p>
<p>本斯一十中日里央社電　河南作戰之失敗，實予渝方以深刻打擊。渝方因日軍作戰節節進展，而對英美之援助不足，屢抱不滿。十日合衆社重慶電，渝方擬於七月七日戰爭進入第入年度時，力圖減少戰門之困難，故訴諸反軸心國，急速援助，其大意如次：渝軍將兵若無武器，戰爭將無勝利之可言。日軍於河南作作戰，動員最精銳之部隊，並以多數軍用戰車裝甲車等，進行作戰。而渝軍未有充分裝備，不但不能與之作戰，更需大部時問，作徒步行動。渝軍與民衆對此已付莫大襲牲，且今仿在繼續中。今實爲反勒心國增加武器，援助解決我等困難之時期。渝方亦知反軸心國之援助，僅賴飛機輸送，故我等要求反軸心國，多備運輸機，輸送補給物品云。</p>
<p>廣州十二日中央社電　據重慶電，重慶政權戰敗原因，以軍械缺乏爲理由，向記者團答辯。其談話要旨如次：重憂軍即有任何嚴格之訓練，而軍械缺乏，仍難望勝利·故惟有望反軸心方面時時接濟軍械云。</p>

<p>柏林十二日中央社電　據海通社訊；德戰地訪員維斯以報道義大利戰訊而成名，近討論反心軍之攻歐係虛張聲勢，抑將成爲事實一項問題。其言略謂，就英美飛機轟炸其前與國人民一事而論，當巳非虛張聲勢而已。至德軍當局對其進攻，則早已採取戒備揹施，並亦深願其發動進攻，目前或將進攻在即，蓋五月氣候已見穩定也。但我守衛大西洋鐵墻之軍隊，皆已沉着等待，準備與之一決雌維，敵人之虛張聲勢或神經戰之計，決難獲逞。</p>

<h3>華北經濟開發槪觀</h3>
<p>華北是大東亞戰爭的兵站，因戰事的日趨激烈，而其使命亦日趨重大。然而重要物資的增產增送上所必要的各種資材，反愈見短少。怎樣克服這跛行狀况，誘致建設上的勝利，這是十九年度華北的新課題。華北開發公司爲適應這爾個絕對的要求，已決定了十九年度的開發事業方針，目前正在東京與中央當局折衝中，即將正式決定。本年度的開發華北經濟方針之重心，乃輕金屬工業與製鐵事業，其次是煤與鐵綫的增產。</p>
<p>製鐵事業十八年度製鐵事業的重心，是完成從日本移設的特設鎔鑛爐之建設，這大體已完成了預定的百分之九十。本年度的重心·除全部完成這特設鎔鑛爐外，並擬開始動工。</p>
<p>製鐵事業的整備，並其原料鐵鑛的增產計劃，也已決定、十入年度的華北，蒙疆鐵鑛的生產狀况，實際成續約爲計劃量的百分之七十，成績不能說好，這是因爲資材，技術不足所致。本年度爲打開這這路，滿洲工業公司與華北開發公司之間已成立諒解，滿業的資村，技術及資本，即將導入該公司，華北與滿洲的聯聚，因此更其密切。</p>
<p>輕金屬業關於輕金屬工業，華北輕金慶工業公司爲其中心，當地的準備，依預定計劃進行中。向日本內地定貨的機械，茍能如期運到，本年內可有製品問世。鋁的就地製造與其原料養土頁岩的增產，亦爲本年度的中心。這增產計劃自二月起付之實施，動力，勞力都稱齊備，遂行政府的增產侖令。</p>
<p>原動力煤再次，說到一切重工業的遠動力的煤。此在數量上比去年度並沒有大見增加，可是想到資材不足等原因，則十九年度的計訓，末必是答意完成的事業。這計劃的中心，在於確保計劃數量，並整備新的藏煤設施，對此，預算上已放出子相當的資金。此外，鑒的增產計劃，或利用鑒育成化學工業，及石炭液化事業的整備等，亦爲本年度的重要事業方針。</p>
<p>資金勞力以上是本徑濟開發的槪觀。要推行這些計劃，約須資金十萬圓。其半數當可就地響措·勞力問題，華北本是勞工極豐富的地方，但最近勞工赴滿的極少，且因機械化不迅速進展，故增產命令愈迫切，有待於勞力的比率亦愈增重。因此，本年度的開發預算，勞務費爲額頗巨。一向放任的勞工對策，今竟成爲新課題，這是中共勢力的增大所致。在華北經濟的開發上成爲新的難題之一，殊不容忽視。（翔：譯自四月二十二日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>諮詢會招待新聞界　研究民生問題　近正商討籌擬民視調整方案</h3>
<p>本市市政當局爲溝通官民意見，設置市政諸訽委員會，已於一日正式成立。該會對於市民生活問題，認爲最關重要，聞正績密研究，準備　議方案。市政府特於昨日招待本市各報社記者，介紹諮詢委員會常務委員晤見，並作種種懇談。市府方面出席者吳秘書長頌皋，糧食局馮局長攸。諮詢委員會方面出席者常務委員會主席李思浩，常務委員林康侯，項康原，陳日平，沈嗣良，陳彬酥，吳蘊齋（因公缺席）。各報社方面出席記者二十餘人。首由吳秘書長致詞介紹，略謂：諮詢委員會成立之後，今天第一次與新聞界見面，藉此談話機會，彼此交挽音意見，職絡情感。希望在座諸君隨便發表意見。</p>
<h3>林康候氏報告會務</h3>
<p>總由林常委康候報告諮詢委員會工作槪况。略謂：剛才吳秘書長已說明聚談目的。諮詢委員會之成立，無疑的官民雙方都致期望，市當局組織詢委員會採納民意，以諮詢方式，研究改進施政方策，是一可喜現象。惟諮詢會之工作極夥，當前最迫切的是民生問題中最主要的糧食與燃料問題，因此，特組織生活必需品小組委員會討論研究，建議要點分兩部份，　整個糧食問顯，　上海糧食問題。研究結果，當待呈請市長核定後再行公布施行。諮詢委員會成立後，擬先擇當前最重要問題，組織財政，敎育·鄉區，治安及生活必需品等五委員會。着手研究，協助市政當局從事革新。常務委員會每星期召集一次，諮詢委員會全體會議每月舉行一次。入後希望新聞界多作忠實建議，如有意見，儲可以書面或口頭咨照本會。此外，本會爲接受市民對於市政之意見，設置「市民意見箱」，希望市民作中實建議與陳述，其詳細辦法另訂公布。常委每星期一星期五下午三時必到會辦公。諮詢委員均爲義務職，辦事人員由第一區公署職員兼任，除文具紙張外，並無任何開支。</p>
<h3>各委員會委員名單</h3>
<p>生活必需品委員會委員　　李思浩　吳蘊齊　陳彬　　金雄白　項康原　馮炳南　袁　登　林康候　戴　　　任　珊陳日平　唐壽民　顏惠慶　朱博泉　沈嗣良　　復恒　稍普卿　林康候　陳日平　趙正平朱博泉戴　　　周作民　陳日平　陳彬　　　雲卿　姚慶三　李權時　吳震修　　復恒李思浩　沈嗣良　吳　　　陳彬　　項康泉　郭順　聞　亭　林康候吳　齊　金雄白　聞　亭　趙　　　任　珊　唐壽民　趙正平</p>
<h3>民食問題提出意見</h3>
<p>旋由中華日報蔣雲章先生提出意見謂：糧食問題，近來黑市漲風又趨熾烈，當局對此有否抑制辦法，以安市民心理。即經吳秘書長，馮局長，李主席委員思浩等相繼表示意見，綜合大意如下：民食問題，非常重要。而過過去困難的　結在於採辦及運輸。第一區公署經濟處及市府糧食局僅僅擔任配給工作。現在市府方面及　詢會生活必需品委員會正集中此問題研究治標治本辦法，研究結果，已得比較迅速易行的方案，同時，並承　邦當局允即充分協助。因此，民食問題，在不久之將來，將有合理的調整。</p>
<h3>陳彬龢氏歸納結論</h3>
<p>最後由陳常委彬龢就出席諸位意見，歸納結論如下：</p>
<p>我認爲上海當前應加重視的問題，約目之有五個：</p>
<p>第一是市民生活問題；</p>
<p>第二是治安問題；</p>
<p>第三是財政問題；</p>
<p>第四是近郊鄉區現狀簡題；</p>
<p>第五是敎育問題。</p>
<p>就市民生活問題而言，以生活必需品的糧食與燃料爲最重要。米糧統制過王去走不通，已毋傭諱言了。現在不能因循，應說改革。改革過程中，應注意下列數點：</p>
<p>勿忘戰時，因爲戰時環境，一定要實施統制政策。但同時，必須顧到適合中國國情與民情。</p>
<p>統制方法，越簡學越好。</p>
<p>官營機構作弊，固然要消滅；而商人之暴利主綫者也須防止。</p>
<p>中日當局，必須取得充分協力。</p>
<p>同時，市民也應協力當局。</p>
<p>此外，市民固然希望當局從速實行改革。但消極方面，市民也須格外節約。譬如日本國內都吃糙米，如民間以米碾白即視爲遠法而處罰·本市虹口方面，日本高級菜館停業，在在表示戰時節約。因爲戰時生活逐漸困難，是必然之事，我們耍效法日本國民的切實節約。</p>
<p>至於燃料問題，煤斤缺乏，非常嚴重，所以，電力一再加以限制。但矛盾現象如通宵麻將，電氣冰箱之耗電，娛樂塲所，旅館酒店之耗電等，就是煤斤充沛時，也應取締，况在電力限制之時，絕對不應任令浪費。一方面固然要求常局從速疏運煤斤，解決燃料恐慌；一方面市氏也竭力節約浪費，渡過難關。</p>
<h3>華中水電公司　加緊電力節約　廿一日限量再减二成</h3>
<p>華中水電公司爲加緊節約電力起見，特規定上海區域自本月二十一日起，其他各地自六月一日起，爲强調消費節約期間，時期爲三個月·向一切電力消費者，不問其國籍，不問其爲軍言民，呼籲切實節約電力，勿逾限制量。目標額暫依現行限制量再滅二成，但因信賴消費者之決戰意識，故不用以前機械式訂正方法，而金恃消費者之自覺及協力。茍消費者無誠意　應此運動，而不能獲得預期成果時，則公司方面或將不得已發動全面强化消費限制，限定供電時間，部分供雷等最後手段。至實施方法，在總領事館，市政府等指導之下，經各隣保班，保甲組織，產業共榮會向同市民傳達本運動之旨趣，並動員報紙，電影，無綫電等宜傳機關以期消費者的澈底明暸，同時，並設調查班實地調查各用戶之節減狀態，成績優良者，予以電費派折等獎賞，成績不佳者則加以停止供電等制裁·至公司方面，則將竭力計劃事業否理化，防止發電供電上之損失，研究實施消費限制量之合理調整，以完成此電力節約運動。華中水電公司靑木副社長，並發表談話，希望市民基於上述原則，共同協力。</p>
<p>法商電力三度通告</p>
<p>又據記者探悉，上海法商電車電燈公司，爲樽節水電，昨又三度潑出通告云：「查本公司爲織節水電事業，於四月二十九三十兩日假報端通告用戶，催晴汪意在案，茲以所有用電，仍會大量超出限額，故本公司嗣後對一切逾限用戶，將不予通知，逕行停供水電，以示制裁。且本公司因治於環境，不得不將原定限量重行核減，其減數量，將分別直接函知，合行通合」云云。</p>

<h3>美海軍政略攻勢　終必成為泡影　松島部長分析一般趨勢</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部於昨日下午三時招待中國記者席上，松島部長發表美國海軍之政略的攻勢。茲誌於後：</p>
<p>情勢所迫亟區　攻</p>
<p>美國海軍之政略的攻勢，巳漸漸迫近。五月十日，金山方面敵美之聯合艦隊司令長官金大將，太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資及西南太平洋反軸心軍司令長官哈爾賽等，會舉行一次作戰會議，會議結果，決定從現在起準備用美國艦隊擊減日本艦隊的企圖，益爲顯着。至敵方積極反攻之原因，可設明爲其國內情勢緊急所逼，非積極反攻不可。</p>
<p>生產能力反見降低</p>
<p>第一，美國生產能力，已達到飽和限度，近來反有低落情形，最近美國飛行企劃委員長威爾遜發表，美航空生產四月份比三月份降低，三月份飛機生產爲八三四〇架，四月份則減少甚多。</p>
<p>美國作戰以來對海軍之損失向不發表，最近以美國人民再三要求，美政府始行發表。但其所發表之數目與日本大本營發表者相差甚遠。根據事實的判斷，其所發表損失數目，尚不到真實數目之半。至其久不發表之原因，無非爲隱瞞實際損失之浩大，以減少人民之汪意耳。美國向稱物資保持平　，現在已感覺物資缺乏，對戰時生活上已起恐慌。茲將美國勞動能工潑生次數錄左：</p>
<p>暴虎馮河夢想成功</p>
<p>第二，羅斯福以總統選舉七月即將到期，因改選時期迫近，故趕快反攻，學想一舉成功·美國作戰向來不顯助綫實際情形，僅抱所謂「愚虎狐河」的戰術，因此美軍作戰前幾上暴露出許多缺點。敵美　爲最重要的戰綫爲從新幾內亞到菲列賓，再從菲律賓至羅南廣東一帶。現在已盡量輸送海陸空軍，準備擊滅日方軍隊·現代作戰戰場與生寶地距離之遠近，因輸送關係，極爲重要，尤其美國專靠物力作戰，以如此的困難，其不能制勝，不言面喻。日本方面以實力充沛，嚴陣以待敵方之攻到內綫，固有恃面無覺業。</p>
<p>本月十日美國費城電發表，九日哈勞德美遜計劃暗殺　斯福。已被逮捕。</p>
<p>謀略官傳小攻自破</p>
<p>最近美國在滬實行謀略宣傳，造出種種　言，　）古賀元帥自殺，　離間日德日蘇關係，　英美　力向上，日本壓力低下，　殲滅日本，關於上述各種謠言，茲分別解答如下：</p>
<p>關於古賀元帥殉職原因，自無需說明。總之，凡自殺者必心臟發弱，以意志薄弱的人，如何能担當大將責任，此種耀眼，係重慶造出，不攻自破。</p>
<p>關於日蘇關係，尤其日蘇問關係之密切，上次被構大島日蘇　業協定及煤油礦權讓出兩條約之簽訂，均可證明日蘇關係之密切。</p>
<p>英美戰力問題，據威爾遜所潑表美國四月份生產較三月份減低，其戰力如何，可想而知。反之·日本利用中國及南方各地之生產，今年船舶生產量較以前超過五六倍以上·</p>
<p>關於殲滅日木問題，日太國民向抱「背水陣」的精神，與其「退以待斃」，不若「進以制勝」·此種謠會益足鼓勵日本國民同仇敵氣之心·</p>

<h3>籲請第四區當局　整飭配給機構</h3>
<p>— 耶魯</p>
<p>凡是居住在第四區的市民，談起對於當地鄕公所的配給情形，都表不滿。例如新遷入該區的市民，等到保甲手續辦竣，居住證領到之後，戶口當然是早經保甲長呈報在案的了，那末，照理關於戶口配給的東西，如米麵油皂之類的配給證，應該像一八兩區一樣，在最短期內發下，但是在第四區的市民搬入之後，還須再隔二三個月甚至半年之久，方機可以領購配給的東西，而且像戶口糖一類，還要延遲。筆者住在第四區，也會受此影響。保甲之中，雖不良的不在少數，但我的一保中的保長，案所廉正，市民稱譽，當不致有尅扣情事，是否鄕公所剋扣民需，不得而知，但人言嘖嘖，可知其中必有弊端，希望當局注意整飭，以免不良人呂　本加馬，而增市民怨憤。</p>
<p>且不談過去情形，即以最近配給戶口肥皂而論，第四區於本月六日起開始配給第二期戶口肥皂，發售之剪刀肥皂定價為三十八元，較之第一區近日配給之該牌肥皂，每塊價格竟高出六元五角，據鄕公所在配給商門口所出佈吿謂係成本關係，但查其他各種配給物價格與一入海區完全相同，蓋同在上海一個配給機構之下，配給物之售價一律，自在情理之中。</p>
<p>年來當局對於各種物品限價，三申五令，不遺餘力，何以在統制機構之下的配給物品，反而隨他增價，而且此次第四區與第一區同日開始配給的肥皂，售價竟相差甚鉅，市民深為不解。深望當局俯以保威信，而得民望。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洪洋譯</p>
<p>從第二天起，隊天就到市來畫家的家裏，以書　的資格來住了。也洒描庭院，也燒洗澡水，也出去買東西，也去送信拿物。</p>
<p>經過一個月後，才發現，這位似乎冷淡異常的畫家，是最親熱的人，同時也體味到了畫家的太太·是我行我素，具有精神病的女性。太太因沒有小孩子，所以往往穿着極時髦的西裝，到外面去，然而每次出去時，她總是呌　大擦皮鞋，這真使麼夫感覺到不舒服。</p>
<p>（他媽的，給女人擦鞋，真倒一萬年霉。）</p>
<p>鹿見島人的脾氣，發作了。然而當時白他，爲了學習，以好忍氣呑聲。</p>
<p>他只是一心一意地練習素描。凡是眼睛所看到的，都一一用木炭和鉛筆，非常精細地描晝下來。當堆積到相當數目時，就送到畫家那邊去批評。</p>
<p>「最要緊的就是素描。努力幹吧！」</p>
<p>除此而外，並沒有甚麼評語，然而市來是承認隆夫有畫才的，這一點，由市來的面孔表情上，也可以看出來。</p>
<p>經會此以後，隆夫就真正感覺到實的趣味了。就是看見一個頻果，看見一根草，也都忍不住要畫下來。他終於本得到老師的許可，而開始玩弄油彩的畫具了。</p>
<p>最初所招的靜物資，自己心裏覺着着，一定要挨馬，然而一拿到市來的面前去，反而受到　獎，說：</p>
<p>「哼，涂的顏色很好。」</p>
<p>有一天，隆夫和市來一同出外作寫生旅行去。拿行李和器具固然是他的責任，然而到達目的地後，他也能在老師的不遠地方，支架起畫架來。</p>
<p>「你的畫，在老練一點上說，倒很有意思。一般人都說我有學圓式的老練，然而你比我更加老練呵！」</p>
<p>市來看着隆夫畫的畫，這樣表示着好意的說。</p>
<p>在隆夫方面看來，是覺不出來老練與新試的·他對於畫壇上的流行綫條，尚未能瞭解。只不過是把眼中所看到的美，照樣描畫出來而巳。</p>
<p>市來自從認真開始指導以來，隆夫的畫，於是蒸蒸日上了。富老師不在家時，也可以使用畫房，於是就把巨型的　布展開來，開始書。然而他愈用功，而市來太太却愈加討厭他。這是因爲他不能兼顧畫童的事情所致。</p>
<p>在第二年的春天，由於太太動議，隆夫不得不離開市來的家了。太太找到了另一位書童，而市來畫家也會替隆夫找到了另一個職業。</p>

        <h1>1944.05.13</h1>
<h3>Difficulties in Public Health</h3>
<p>In the third session of the East Asia Medical Association Conference last month, Health Minister Sa Runzhi spoke on "Public Health Administration Plans and Medical Education Issues," pointing out three difficulties in currently undertaking public health endeavors: factionalism preventing sincere cooperation; lack of talent not meeting needs; and an annual budget of only over a hundred million yuan, insufficient for proper application. Regarding these three points, he offered several management suggestions.</p>
<p>There were originally no factions in China's new academic circles. The reason for the creation of factions in new medicine is entirely due to British and American colonial-style education. The hospitals and medical schools established by the British and Americans in China invariably had, at their core, the commercial goal of promoting British and American goods. This led to the creation of terms like "British-American faction," "German-Japanese faction," and "Franco-Belgian faction," using economic power to manipulate medical groups and monopolize medical undertakings. At one point, they even used political power, attempting to overthrow everything and exclusively dominate China. Some blind Chinese people echoed and utilized this, using it as an opportunity for personal advancement and wealth. China's public health endeavors should be based on the standpoint of the Chinese people, but in the past, Chinese public health endeavors often carried the meaning of British and American aggression. This is undeniable. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, most of the enemy hospitals and medical schools have been handed over to the Chinese government for management. At the same time, all future courses will be taught in the national language. In this way, the fundamental reason for British and American aggression is removed, and the country's use of talent no longer distinguishes between factions. With practical learning as the standard, the problem of medical factions will naturally cease to exist. Medical technology is universal and inherently without factions. Chinese medical talents serve the Chinese people, and naturally, they are all united.</p>
<p>In the past, our country has felt a lack of medical talent. We have repeatedly made statements in light of the Allied nations' special emphasis on medical school education. Because when it comes to public health endeavors, when it comes to medical care, if the problem of personnel is not resolved, everything else is simply out of the question. Medical education is an urgent issue at present. The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education must unite to formulate a plan to train a certain number of doctors and nurses in the coming years. These doctors and nurses must be used by the state and not be like private practitioners. At the same time, methods for further education should be sought for existing talent, either by establishing research institutes at the central level or by sending them to Japan for advanced studies, with the government bearing all expenses, stipulating that they must serve the country. We hope that the expansion and increase of national medical education institutions will ensure that those educated do not only consider their personal livelihood interests but aim to serve the people. In this way, the country cultivates a talent, and the country has a use for that talent.</p>
<p>Regarding the Ministry of Health's budget, the national central agency has only over one million yuan. This amount was already insufficient before the war. Based on current purchasing power, it is feared that even the equipment for a single laboratory cannot be afforded. We deeply believe this is a national regret. During wartime, the country's human and material resources must be protected and increased. The most important method of protecting human resources lies in public health, because during wartime, more people die from disease than from direct combat. Combat is unavoidable, but disease can be eliminated. Therefore, during wartime, the country's work in eliminating disease in the rear is sufficient to increase the fighting power at the front. All belligerent countries pay close attention to this, and Allied Japan is a prime example. Therefore, an increase in the Ministry of Health's budget must be realized immediately. However, the Ministry of Health's budget should be spent on operations, not on administration, so that it will have a real effect on protecting the nation's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Imphal Offensive and Defensive Battle Currently Unfolding Heroically - Japanese Aircraft Bomb Artillery Positions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: With the rainy season having arrived, the enemy forces, relying solely on air routes for supplies, have become increasingly panicked in recent days. Currently, fierce battles are unfolding between Japanese and British forces in the hills surrounding Imphal, so the daily artillery fire is thunderous, which is quite terrible. The Japanese army has completed the encirclement of the enemy's circular defensive line within a 30-kilometer radius of Imphal, while the enemy forces are only fiercely attacking the Japanese army with artillery fire, like trapped beasts. Both sides are now engaged in a heroic offensive and defensive battle, so Imphal has now fallen into a decisive battle state.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: The fighter squadron of the Japanese air force in Burma flew to the skies over Palel on the morning of the 11th and carried out low-altitude bombing of enemy artillery positions entrenched in Ailan and Sabam, dealing a devastating blow to the enemy's main force. Several hours later, they made contact with ten enemy high-speed aircraft over Palel and engaged in fierce aerial combat, shooting down one of them, and the enemy aircraft were defeated. Furthermore, on the way back, they discovered three enemy North American bombers attempting to attack a certain base and pursued them, shooting down one of them in the Arakan Mountains, 12 kilometers west of Shebao. One was unconfirmed. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft self-destructed.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th: The Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced on the 11th that the Japanese army had launched an attack in the Palel highway area and had withdrawn from the position after fierce resistance from the Anti-Axis forces. It was also confirmed that the Japanese army had the advantage in the area.</p>
<h3>Funeral of Marshal Koga Held Solemnly Yesterday - Prime Minister Tojo Personally Offered Incense and Paid Respects</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: The naval funeral of the late Japanese Navy Admiral Marshal Koga was solemnly held today at Tsukiji Hongwanji Temple. Marshal Koga was a general revered by the Japanese people. In order to express their condolences, the citizens of Tokyo flew flags at half-mast at every house on this day. The streets through which the spirit of the Marshal passed were filled with welcoming citizens. Therefore, the funeral procession of Marshal Koga's spirit arrived in front of Hongwanji Temple at 12:25 amidst the worship of thousands of people and the melodious sound of military music. On the street in front of the magnificent and great Hongwanji Temple, demobilized soldiers, various branch associations, schools, agencies, and groups were lined up. At both ends of the street, it was crowded with tens of thousands of citizens waiting to pay their respects, with no sound at all. Listening carefully, there were often faint weeping sounds in the crowd. The expression on everyone's face was full of mourning, solemnity, and indignation. At 12:50, the Imperial Family, government officials, and various guests arrived at the venue one after another. Dignified honor guards were lined up outdoors. On the altar in front of the venue, the spirit and portrait of the late Marshal Koga were placed. In front of the spirit were flowers and offerings bestowed by the Empress Dowager and both Their Majesties the Emperor and Empress. Various medals of the Marshal were displayed on the table, and many flowers offered by officials and guests were also arranged around it, further decorating the venue solemnly and grandly under the illumination of mercury lamps. At 1:00 PM, the chief mourner, Marshal Koga's wife, relatives, Naval Minister Shimada, members of the funeral committee, those accompanying the coffin, and those carrying the Marshal's sword, medals, and commemorative badges, as well as Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet ministers, officials, and guests, took their seats in order, and the ceremony began. First, everyone stood in silence. After the Imperial Envoy, representing the Imperial Family, offered the Imperial salute, Naval Minister Shimada and other officials delivered eulogies. The honor guards raised their guns in salute, then chanted sutras. Then, Naval Minister Shimada, the bereaved family, and relatives offered incense and paid their respects. At 1:45 PM, Prime Minister Tojo, representing the 100 million Japanese people, offered incense to the spirit of the Marshal. At the same time, the honor guards outside simultaneously raised their guns and fired three salutes into the air. Three wisps of white cloud immediately appeared in the blue sky. At this time, all the Japanese people across the country also silently prayed and paid their respects to the spirit of Marshal Koga in their own homes, factories, and streets. From 2:00 PM, joint worship by various groups, schools, and citizens began. Tens of thousands of citizens immediately and automatically formed orderly lines, and gradually went to the spirit to offer incense and pay their respects. The funeral venue of Marshal Koga was also filled with feelings of grief and determination. When each citizen paid their respects to the spirit of the Marshal, they seemed to be vowing, "We will not rest until we have destroyed Britain and America."</p>
<h3>German Head of State Expresses Condolences for Marshal Koga - Japanese Emperor Sends Reply of Great Thanks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 12th: After the martyrdom of the late Navy Admiral Marshal Koga, German Head of State Hitler sent a telegram to His Majesty the Japanese Emperor on the 11th to express his condolences. On the same day, the Emperor sent a reply of thanks. The Ministry of the Imperial Household announced on the 12th that German Head of State Hitler had sent a Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves to the late Navy Admiral Koga, and His Majesty the Japanese Emperor had sent a reply of thanks.</p>
<h3>Warriors of the Indian National Army Talk About Their Impressions of Participating in the War - Fighting for Liberation as Friends with the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: Warriors of the Indian National Army held a symposium recently at a certain Japanese army base in Arakan. A reporter personally heard their statements about their impressions of the old battles and their distant ideals, and also had a Q&amp;A session with them as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Army's Skillful Tactics Lead to Victory. Question: Gentlemen of the National Army, after this joint operation with the Japanese Army Assault Unit, and after this life together, what are your feelings about the differences between the Japanese and British armies? Please have Captain A express his opinion. (A) The British army often starts with the winning code and the basic principles of combat, but the Japanese Army Assault Unit's combat principles do not take this as an example. For example, maintaining and communicating connections are cleverly used as sharp tools, but the Japanese army can often gain physiological advantages due to the advancement of tactics. For example, in this assault unit operation, they first thoroughly understood the enemy's weaknesses, and then launched an attack on the enemy's flanks and rear, thus completing the great mission in less than two days. The enemy's rear base and communication lines were also completely cut off without leakage. After six days of difficult and dangerous mountain roads, the enemy was finally defeated. Therefore, the morale of the Japanese army is even more旺盛. If the British army is compared with the Japanese army, it is like the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Never Stop Until the Goal Is Achieved. What are your impressions after participating in this operation? (B) All of us in the National Army deeply understand the purpose of liberation and its greatness. The entire army swore that they would never stop fighting until the goal of liberation and independence was achieved. We regard returning to the rear as a kind of shame. This is the first time we have fought side by side with the Japanese army. We sincerely admire the lofty spirit and firm will of the Japanese army. (C) The Japanese army's quiet and swift marching, the strictness of military discipline, and the greatness of their spirit of obedience are most admirable. During combat, even if food is interrupted, their fighting spirit does not diminish slightly. "Sacrificing the small self, loving the country, and regarding death as returning home," the Japanese army deserves these few words. (D) Japanese officers and soldiers always carry happiness and joy in their conversations, and their morale is the same. The Japanese army may not have a meal for several days, but their protection of the wounded and sick soldiers and their marching and combat are still the same as usual. Moreover, the Japanese army has always maintained confidence in victory.</p>
<p>Protecting the Wounded and Sick Soldiers Is a Duty That Should Be Fulfilled. Question: Lieutenant D once took care of a large number of Japanese wounded and sick soldiers during the Xinzeva operation, enduring all kinds of hardships and completing a great mission. Please briefly express the situation and your feelings at that time. (D) There is really no hardship to speak of. The Japanese people are sacrificing themselves and fighting everywhere for the liberation of Greater East Asia. We Indians pray for victory for our motherland and for Greater East Asia. Protecting Japanese wounded and sick soldiers is a duty that should be fulfilled. Even if we die in battle, we can win the gratitude of 400 million compatriots. This is really a great undertaking. Although Japanese soldiers are injured, they still often say "Go to the front line to kill the enemy, kill the enemy." I really admire this. Question: Captain, what were your impressions when you first commanded the National Army as a commander? (A) The difficulties encountered by the National Army in this operation were expected, so I was very worried about the completion of the mission. As a result, we were able to achieve results beyond expectations, and I believe that the future must be bright.</p>
<p>Sacrificing the Small Self Can Lead to Victory. Question: Do you think that you have gained a lot of valuable experience participating in this operation? (B) After this battle, the National Army has increased several times in spirit. At the same time, we have gained a lot of practical and valuable experience from the Japanese army. We used to think that it would be difficult to complete the operation without rear support, but after this operation, we completely overturned this idea. After all, the army does not only fight with material things, but also relies heavily on spirit. (D) The enemy has no such strong fighting spirit. As soon as they are hit, they abandon their armor and weapons and are in a terrible state. Even if our food is cut off, we can fight like the Japanese army, and we will never lose our fighting spirit due to a slight blow. (G) I now understand that whether it is a commander or a soldier, if they are willing to sacrifice the small self, they can win. For example, the several times that food was cut off during this operation, we finally completed the mission after considerable endurance. This is the best example.</p>
<p>The God of Victory Is Always by Our Side. (D) Soldiers of an independent country only know how to kill themselves to achieve benevolence. We are independent Indian soldiers with a spirit of sacrifice. We want to be friends with the brave Japanese soldiers. If we do not achieve victory, we will never be able to return home. I believe that the God of Victory is always by our side.</p>

<h3>Chongqing and Communist Representatives Hold Talks</h3>

<h3>Amphibious "Dream Tour" Car to Appear After the War</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Zurich, 12th: Reuter's reports, according to American communication news: Chevrolet Motor Company stated that 16 million of the latest "Dream Tour" cars will appear after the war. The design of the new car has now been completed. It has a speed of 100 miles per hour and can wade through water like a duck. It is equipped with a shortwave radio, so drivers can pre-order meals from hotels or reserve rooms from hotels along the way, and it has a temperature control device, which is equipped on the rear of the car.</p>
<h3>Burma Formally Appoints Special Investigation Team to Inspect China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Rangoon, 12th: The Chief Administrator of Burma's Bhamo recently believed that Burma's independence was recent, and in order to seek sound development in the future, to take on the responsibility of a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to benefit the strengthening of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, he specially appointed Dr. Ba Han, Chairman of the Legal Review Committee, as the chief member of the Special Investigation Team, leading the team to inspect China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand and other countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. This matter was formally announced on the 11th. According to the plan, the dispatch of the Special Investigation Team was decided after careful consideration by the Bhamo national representative after returning from attending the Greater East Asia Conference last November. There are two purposes: first, in view of the fact that Burma's political, economic, and administrative aspects all need to be promoted in the most scientific and efficient way during wartime, it is planned to establish a planning institute, and the dispatch of the investigation team will serve as preparation for the establishment of the government's central authority. Second, to change the situation in various countries of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to have cordial talks with the leaders of various countries, to promote friendly relations between the countries and to strengthen the ties between the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The dispatch of the investigation team as goodwill ambassadors has great significance in Burma. Regarding the dispatch of investigation teams to foreign countries, except for the so-called inspection team to France during the Mindon Dynasty in the past, this is the first time in Burma. Therefore, the Burmese government has high expectations for it. As for the content of the investigation, there are more than 200 items in 11 departments, including national planning, land irrigation, resource labor, agriculture, industry, trade, credit, finance, and education. According to the committee's announcement, in addition to the aforementioned committee members, there are two other committee members, namely Dai Shaozha and Wei Jingnian. When they were formally appointed on the 11th, Bhamo also announced that the special investigation of Bici was the first of its kind in Burma, and its significance was profound and great. The task of the investigation team is to conduct in-depth research on the construction status of Japan and other East Asian countries, especially administrative planning and wartime production. The investigation is about how the Greater East Asian countries exchange experts. The kind of agreement is even more about how to strengthen cooperation among the Greater East Asian countries during the wartime. In short, the purpose of this investigation is to establish a closer relationship between Burma and the Greater East Asian countries, and to bear the task of a goodwill ambassador.</p>

<h3>Central Reserve Bank Restricts Lending - Defines Scope and Target - And Divides Areas to Determine Collateralized Lending Limits</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th: In order to assist the government in stabilizing prices and promote production, the Central Reserve Bank has formulated measures to restrict lending. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. It is now known that the bank, in its capacity as a national bank, is supervising financial institutions to work together to eliminate the trend of speculation and hoarding, and to encourage production enterprises. It is gradually contracting general commercial lending, so that the funds of various industries can be balanced and adjusted. Based on this principle, it has recently adjusted its business policy, defining the scope and target of lending, and dividing areas for lending and not lending, which will be implemented from today. The detailed measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Inter-bank lending necessary to regulate the market. (Divided into two parts.) (A) Operational lending adopts an absolute collateral system, deliberates on the actual situation of each industry, determines the limit, and after each industry obtains the loan, it will be used in industry and commerce at any time, or retained for its own emergency use. (B) Production loans are based on the principle of re-mortgaging, and the limit will be determined separately in accordance with the previous regulations. The selection of this lending, the borrower's purpose, collateral, the quantity of raw materials purchased, the production situation, product sales, inventory quantity, and production capacity must be thoroughly investigated and supervised. If it is found that the borrower has suspended production or is not used for direct production departments, it can be recovered or rejected at any time. Various special loans under the national government agencies or national policy. The above loans cannot be undertaken by ordinary financial institutions, and are generally directly undertaken by the Central Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>In addition, the Central Reserve Bank has temporarily divided the locations where it has branches into areas for lending and not lending, depending on the establishment of financial institutions. The regulations are as follows: Nanjing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou are areas where ordinary commercial loans are not made. If there is a need for operational lending between industries and they provide collateral goods for re-mortgaging, the original cargo owner should be a formal business. However, the lending limit for each business and the types of collateral must also be strictly determined. As for production loans, they are all undertaken by the industry and trade and re-mortgaged to the Central Reserve Bank. If the funds that the industry cannot undertake are not available, the Central Reserve Bank may temporarily directly lend them. Ningbo, Bengbu, Wuhu, Zhenjiang, Changshu, Yangzhou, Taixian, Nantong, Anqing, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Kunshan, Xiashi, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and Zhenhai are areas where ordinary commercial loans can be temporarily made, but lending is not a fixed business. In addition to production loans, if it is necessary to undertake business mortgage loans, the lending limit for each business and the types of collateral must still be carefully investigated in advance and reasonably determined to prevent hoarding. Hankou, Wuchang, Nanchang, Jiujiang, Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang, Suqian, and Huaiyin are absolutely not making loans unless specially approved.</p>
<h3>Japan's Imperial Headquarters Announces: War Situation in Central China; Focus of Conflict Shifts to the Funiu Mountains</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:40 PM on the 12th: Japanese forces in Central China, after launching an offensive from the vicinity of Xinyang on May 1st, began advancing north. By the 9th, they had successfully linked up with Japanese forces advancing south from the area formerly of Xuchang in North China. Japanese forces operating in the western region of the Pinghan Railway, after annihilating the main force of Tang Enbo's army southeast of Luoyang, are currently continuing their offensive. Since the commencement of this operation and up to May 6th, the primary confirmed results are as follows: Enemy forces suffered losses of 19,500 dead left behind, 4,031 captured, and captured various artillery pieces totaling 101 and approximately 7,000 firearms. Japanese casualties amounted to 213 dead.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – Japanese forces converged between Suiping and Zhumadian on the 10th. After only three weeks of fighting, over 200 li of railway between Luoyang and Xinyang is now under Japanese control. Currently, there are approximately 100,000 to 150,000 of Chiang's troops in the Zhengzhou and Luoyang areas; however, they have been fragmented into four or five pieces. It is quite astonishing to observers that the combat power of Tang Enbo's army, regarded as the most elite unit under Chiang's command, is so weak. This also serves as concrete evidence of the declining combat strength of Chongqing. The focus of military operations has shifted to the Funiu Mountains south of Luoyang, where the main enemy forces are engaged in fierce battles around Lushan. The Chongqing side claims that the Japanese operation aims to open the Beijing-Hankou Railway. As Luoyang is now in an encirclement situation, the direction in which the elite Japanese troops will turn is something we should wait and see.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Occupy Areas Along the Railway Line</p>
<p>Xinzheng, 12th (Central News Agency) – After crossing the Yellow River, the main force of the Japanese army in North China launched a large-scale annihilation campaign against Tang Enbo's troops in the Funiu Mountains on both sides of the Pinghan Railway. Another strong force of the Japanese army is rapidly pursuing the defeated Chongqing troops along the Longhai Railway, advancing south along the Pinghan Railway, and quickly crossing major and minor rivers. By the evening of the 4th, they had approached Yanling, a city garrisoned by the First Division of the 19th Army (Gu Xijiu) of the 19th Army Group of Chongqing troops, and the Third Cavalry Division under He Zhuguo of the 50th Army Group, totaling approximately 7,000 men. The enemy used a tributary of the Ying River outside the city as their only defense, putting up fierce resistance. The Japanese army outflanked the Chongqing troops from the east and launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 5th, inflicting heavy damage and occupying the city. They then quickly advanced south from the Henan Plain, rapidly occupying Suiping, which was defended by the Third Cavalry Division of the Chongqing army, and further advancing south. The vanguard units converged with the elite Japanese troops in Central China in Queshan on the 9th. Consequently, an area of 80 kilometers along the Ping-Han Railway has fallen under Japanese control.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Chongqing Troops on the Longhai Railway</p>
<p>2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the front line in Henan on the 12th, the Japanese air force has been dispatching aircraft to the front lines every day to assist the ground forces in their operations. On the morning of the 11th, they bombed four trucks of the Chongqing side retreating westward from the western section of the Longhai Railway (near Mianchi), and also bombed four locomotives. The troops and supplies carried on these vehicles were completely destroyed, and their rear transport routes were severed. After achieving their objectives, the Japanese aircraft safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Chongqing Eagerly Awaits Anglo-American Aid</p>
<p>This Standard Central News Agency report from Chongqing states that the failure of the Henan operation has dealt a severe blow to Chongqing. Chongqing has repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction due to the continuous progress of Japanese operations and the insufficient aid from Britain and America. A Chongqing dispatch from the Associated Press on the 10th stated that Chongqing plans to reduce wartime difficulties as the war enters its eighth year on July 7th, and therefore appeals to the anti-Axis countries for rapid assistance, the gist of which is as follows: Without weapons for the troops, there can be no victory in war. In the Henan operation, the Japanese army mobilized its most elite troops and employed numerous military tanks and armored vehicles in their operations. The Chongqing army, lacking sufficient equipment, not only cannot fight them but also requires a great deal of time to travel on foot. The Chongqing army and the people have paid a great price for this and are still continuing to do so. Now is truly the time for the anti-Axis countries to increase weapons and aid to solve our difficulties. Chongqing also knows that anti-Axis aid relies solely on air transport, so we request the anti-Axis countries to provide more transport aircraft to deliver supplies.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing government attributed the cause of their defeat to a lack of military equipment when responding to reporters. The main points of their discussion are as follows: Even if the Chongqing army receives any rigorous training, it is still difficult to hope for victory with a lack of military equipment. Therefore, we can only hope that the anti-Axis powers will constantly supply us with military equipment.</p>
<h3>Youth Model Corps; Returned Students from Japan Violate National Policy; Sent to Agricultural Youth Training Center for Internship</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) – The Third Detachment of the New Movement Central Youth Model Corps, which sent twelve members to study in Japan last year, has now graduated and returned to China, arriving in Nanjing on April 22nd.

British bomber formations based in the United Kingdom attempted to carry out large-scale air raids on Western Europe on the morning of the 10th, conducting concentrated bombings of the Juniville aircraft factory on the west coast of France, the suburbs of Paris, eastern France, and the Anaya factory within Italian territory. Meanwhile, American air forces based in Italy, in conjunction with other units, bombed Vienna and its vicinity in the eastern Alps and the Danube River basin around the 11th. As a result of the interception by German fighter formations and the cooperation of ground fire, several American four-engine bombers were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) – According to a Huitong News Agency report, German war correspondent Weiss, who became famous for his reports on the Italian war, recently discussed the question of whether the anti-Axis powers' offensive in Europe is a bluff or will become a reality. He said, in short, that judging from the fact that British and American aircraft are bombing the people of their former countries, it is no longer a bluff. As for the German military authorities, they have long taken precautionary measures against their attack and are also eager for it to launch an attack. The attack may be imminent, as the weather in May is becoming stable. However, our troops guarding the Atlantic Wall are all waiting calmly, ready to fight them to the death. The enemy's bluffs or psychological warfare tactics will never succeed.</p>
<h3>Romanian Capital Evacuates Children</h3>

<h3>Overview of Economic Development in North China</h3>
<p>North China is a military base for the Greater East Asia War, and its mission is becoming increasingly important as the war intensifies. However, various materials necessary for increasing production and transportation of important materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How to overcome this limping situation and lead to victory in construction is the new task of the 19th fiscal year in North China. In order to meet this absolute requirement, the North China Development Company has decided on the development business policy for the 19th fiscal year and is currently negotiating with the central authorities in Tokyo, which will be formally decided soon. The focus of this year's economic development policy in North China is light metal industry and steelmaking, followed by increased production of coal and iron ore.</p>
<p>Steelmaking Business In the 18th fiscal year, the focus of the steelmaking business was to complete the construction of the specially established smelting furnace transferred from Japan, which has largely completed 90% of the planned work. The focus of this year is to fully complete this specially established smelting furnace and to start construction.</p>
<p>Preparations for the steelmaking business and plans for increasing the production of iron ore, its raw material, have also been decided. In the 18th fiscal year, the actual production of iron ore in North China and Mongolia was about 70% of the planned amount, which cannot be said to be a good result. This is due to insufficient materials and technology. In order to solve this problem this year, an understanding has been reached between the Manchuria Industrial Company and the North China Development Company. The capital, technology, and capital of Manchuria will be introduced into the company, making the alliance between North China and Manchuria even closer.</p>
<p>Light Metal Industry Regarding the light metal industry, the North China Light Metal Industry Company is at its center, and local preparations are proceeding according to plan. If the machinery ordered from Japan can arrive as scheduled, products can be launched within this year. On-site production of aluminum and increased production of its raw material, alum shale, are also the focus of this year. This production increase plan has been implemented since February, and power and labor are sufficient, implementing the government's production increase orders.</p>
<p>Raw Material Coal Next, speaking of coal, the driving force of all heavy industries. There has been no significant increase in quantity compared to last year, but considering the lack of materials and other reasons, the training for the 19th fiscal year may not be a satisfactory achievement. The center of this plan lies in ensuring the planned quantity and preparing new coal storage facilities, for which a considerable amount of funds has been released in the budget. In addition, the increased production plan, or the use of cyanide to develop chemical industries, and the preparation of coal liquefaction projects are also important business policies for this year.</p>
<p>Funds and Labor The above is an overview of this economic development. To promote these plans, approximately 100,000 yuan is required. Half of it can be handled locally. Regarding the labor problem, North China is originally a very abundant place for labor, but recently very few laborers have gone to Manchuria, and because mechanization is not progressing rapidly, the more urgent the production increase order is, the greater the ratio of labor is needed. Therefore, in this year's development budget, the labor cost is quite large. The previously laissez-faire labor policy has now become a new issue, which is caused by the increase in the power of the Chinese Communist Party. It has become one of the new difficulties in the economic development of North China and should not be ignored. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun of April 22)</p>

<h3>Consultation Committee Invites Press to Study People's Livelihood Issues; Actively Discussing and Drafting a Plan to Adjust People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>In order to communicate opinions between officials and the people, the Municipal Government of this city established a Municipal Affairs Consultation Committee, which was formally established on the 1st. The committee believes that issues related to the people's livelihood are of utmost importance and is reportedly conducting intensive research to prepare a proposal. The Municipal Government specifically invited reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday to introduce the standing committee members of the Consultation Committee and to conduct various cordial discussions. Those present from the Municipal Government were Secretary-General Wu Songgao and Director of the Food Bureau Feng You. Those present from the Consultation Committee were Chairman of the Standing Committee Li Sihao and Standing Committee members Lin Kanghou, Xiang Kangyuan, Chen Ribing, Shen Siliang, Chen Binsu, and Wu Yunzhai (absent due to official business). More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. First, Secretary-General Wu delivered a speech of introduction, briefly stating: After the establishment of the Consultation Committee, this is the first time we are meeting with the press today. We hope to take this opportunity to exchange opinions and strengthen relationships. We hope that everyone present will freely express your opinions.</p>
<h3>Mr. Lin Kanghou Reports on Committee Affairs</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Member Lin Kanghou then reported on the general situation of the Consultation Committee's work. He briefly stated: Secretary-General Wu has just explained the purpose of the meeting. The establishment of the Consultation Committee is undoubtedly expected by both officials and the people. It is a welcome phenomenon that the Municipal Government is organizing a consultation committee to adopt public opinion and study and improve administrative policies through consultation. However, the work of the Consultation Committee is extremely large. The most urgent issues at present are the most important issues related to the people's livelihood, namely food and fuel. Therefore, a special Subcommittee on Daily Necessities has been organized to discuss and study them. The proposed points are divided into two parts: 1. The entire food issue; 2. The Shanghai food issue. The results of the research will be submitted to the Mayor for approval before being announced and implemented. After the establishment of the Consultation Committee, it is planned to first select the most important issues at present and organize five committees: Finance, Education, Rural Areas, Public Security, and Daily Necessities. Begin to research and assist the Municipal Government in carrying out reforms. The Standing Committee will convene once a week, and the plenary meeting of the Consultation Committee will be held once a month. In the future, it is hoped that the press will provide more honest suggestions. If you have any opinions, you can submit them to the committee in writing or orally. In addition, in order to receive citizens' opinions on municipal administration, the committee has set up a "Citizens' Opinion Box." We hope that citizens will provide honest suggestions and statements. Detailed methods will be formulated and announced separately. Standing Committee members must be present at the meeting to work from 3:00 PM every Monday and Friday. The consultation committee members are all volunteers, and the staff members are concurrently held by the staff members of the First District Public Office. In addition to stationery and paper, there are no other expenses.</p>
<h3>List of Committee Members</h3>
<p>Members of the Daily Necessities Committee: Li Sihao, Wu Yunqi, Chen Bin, Jin Xiongbai, Xiang Kangyuan, Feng Bingnan, Yuan Deng, Lin Kanghou, Dai Ren, Shan Chen Ribing, Tang Shoumin, Yan Huiqing, Zhu Boquan, Shen Siliang, Fu Heng, Shao Puqing, Lin Kanghou, Chen Ribing, Zhao Zhengping, Zhu Boquan, Dai Zhou Zuomin, Chen Ribing, Chen Bin, Yunqing, Yao Qingsan, Li Quanshi, Wu Zhenxiu, Fu Heng, Li Sihao, Shen Siliang, Wu Chen Bin, Xiang Kangquan, Guo Shun, Wen Ting, Lin Kanghou, Wu Qi, Jin Xiongbai, Wen Ting, Zhao Ren Shan, Tang Shoumin, Zhao Zhengping</p>
<h3>Opinions Raised on Food Issues</h3>
<p>Mr. Jiang Yunzhang of the China Daily then raised an opinion, saying: Recently, the black market for food has become more fierce again. Does the authorities have any methods to suppress it in order to stabilize the people's minds? Secretary-General Wu, Director Feng, and Committee Chairman Li Sihao expressed their opinions one after another. The general idea is as follows: The issue of food is very important. The difficulties in the past lie in procurement and transportation. The Economic Department of the First District Public Office and the Municipal Food Bureau only take charge of distribution work. Now, the Municipal Government and the Subcommittee on Daily Necessities of the Consultation Committee are focusing on this issue to study stopgap measures and fundamental solutions. As a result of the research, a relatively rapid and easy-to-implement plan has been obtained. At the same time, the local authorities have agreed to provide full assistance. Therefore, the food issue will be reasonably adjusted in the near future.</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Binsu Summarizes the Conclusions</h3>
<p>Finally, Standing Committee Member Chen Binsu summarized the conclusions of the opinions of all those present as follows:</p>
<p>I believe that there are about five issues that Shanghai should pay more attention to at present:</p>
<p>First is the issue of the people's livelihood;</p>
<p>Second is the issue of public security;</p>
<p>Third is the issue of finance;</p>
<p>Fourth is the issue of the current situation in the suburbs;</p>
<p>Fifth is the issue of education.</p>
<p>In terms of the issue of the people's livelihood, food and fuel, which are daily necessities, are the most important. It is undeniable that the past rice grain control has not worked. We cannot follow the old ways and should talk about reform. In the process of reform, we should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>Do not forget the wartime, because in the wartime environment, we must implement a control policy. But at the same time, we must take into account the suitability for China's national conditions and the people's sentiments.</p>
<p>The more simple the control method, the better.</p>
<p>Corruption in government-run institutions must be eliminated; and merchants who seek exorbitant profits must also be prevented.</p>
<p>The Chinese and Japanese authorities must obtain full cooperation.</p>
<p>At the same time, citizens should also cooperate with the authorities.</p>
<p>In addition, citizens certainly hope that the authorities will implement reforms as soon as possible. But in a negative way, citizens must also be more frugal. For example, people in Japan eat brown rice, and if people grind rice into white rice, they are regarded as violating the law and punished. In the Hongkou area of this city, high-end Japanese restaurants have closed, which indicates wartime frugality. Because wartime life is gradually becoming difficult, it is inevitable. We must emulate the practical frugality of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>As for the fuel issue, the lack of coal is very serious, so electricity has been restricted again and again. However, contradictory phenomena such as all-night mahjong, the electricity consumption of electric refrigerators, and the electricity consumption of entertainment venues, hotels, etc. should be banned even when coal is abundant, let alone at a time when electricity is restricted. On the one hand, we certainly demand that the authorities quickly transport coal to solve the fuel panic; on the other hand, the citizens also strive to conserve and avoid waste to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<h3>Central China Water and Electricity Company Intensifies Electricity Conservation; Limited Quantity Reduced by Another 20% on the 21st</h3>
<p>In order to intensify electricity conservation, the Central China Water and Electricity Company has specifically stipulated that the Shanghai area will start from the 21st of this month, and other areas will start from June 1st, as a period to emphasize consumption conservation for a period of three months. To all electricity consumers, regardless of their nationality or whether they are military or civilian, we urge them to earnestly conserve electricity and not exceed the limited quantity. The target amount is temporarily reduced by another 20% based on the current limit. However, because we trust the consumer's determination to fight, we do not use the previous mechanical correction method, but instead rely on the consumer's self-awareness and cooperation. If consumers are not sincere in responding to this movement and cannot achieve the expected results, then the company may have to launch a comprehensive strengthening of consumption restrictions, such as limiting power supply time and partial power supply. As for the implementation method, under the guidance of the Consulate General, the Municipal Government, etc., the purpose of this movement will be conveyed to fellow citizens through various neighborhood protection groups, Baojia organizations, and the Industrial Cooperative Association, and newspapers, movies, radio and other propaganda agencies will be mobilized to thoroughly understand the consumer. At the same time, a survey team will be set up to conduct on-site surveys of the reduction status of each user, and those with excellent results will be rewarded with electricity bill discounts, while those with poor results will be punished with power outages. As for the company, it will strive to plan business rationalization, prevent losses in power generation and supply, and study and implement reasonable adjustments to the consumption limit in order to complete this electricity conservation movement. Aokiyoshitaro, Vice President of Central China Water and Electricity Company, also issued a statement, hoping that citizens will work together based on the above principles.</p>
<p>French Power Company Issues Third Notice</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, the Shanghai French Tramway and Electric Lighting Company, in order to conserve water and electricity, issued a third notice yesterday: "In order to organize water and electricity business, this company issued a notice to users on April 29 and 30, urging them to pay attention to this matter. However, all electricity consumption still greatly exceeds the limit. Therefore, this company will not notify all users who exceed the limit in the future and will directly suspend the supply of water and electricity as a sanction. Moreover, due to environmental governance, this company has to re-examine the original set limit, and the reduced quantity will be notified separately by letter. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>The Fifteen Banks in This City Loan Funds for Cocoon Collection</h3>
<p>Totaling Fifty Million Yuan</p>
<p>Due to the upcoming season for spring cocoons, the China Silk Corporation and silk factories in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places require funds for large-scale purchase of spring cocoons. They jointly approached the banking sector in this city for cocoon collection loans. After several rounds of negotiations, fifteen banks in this city, including the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Real Estate Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Tianlu Bank, Guohua Bank, and Huaxing Bank, have organized a cocoon collection loan syndicate, establishing a fifty million yuan loan. The China Silk Corporation will borrow twenty-five million yuan, and the silk factories in Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places will borrow twenty-five million yuan. When the loans are issued, the Silk Industry Association will provide certification. The banks will handle the loans by accepting banker's acceptances, with an interest rate of 1%. The Central Reserve Bank has agreed to handle discounting, with a discount interest rate of 1.2%. The loan term is three months per period.</p>
<h3>Wartime Consumption Special Tax to Be Universally Implemented on a Regular Basis, Collected by Branch Offices Starting on the 16th</h3>
<p>The Tax Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has been ordered to implement the wartime consumption special tax, starting from January 16th of this year, in fifteen cities and counties, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wujin, Danyang, Changshu, Suhu, Bengbu, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and Ningbo. The tax will be levied on retail goods and banquets/hotels. The tax rate for ordinary goods is 4% of the value, and for luxury goods, it is 10% of the value. As for the consumption special tax on banquets and hotels, it is 15% of the total revenue. Except for the tax revenue in the first district and old eight districts of Shanghai, which is entrusted to the municipal government for collection, the consumption special tax in other areas will be collected by the local tax branch offices under the administration, and the revenue will be reported and transferred to the treasury on a monthly basis. In recent months, the tax revenue has been very good. It is now learned that, in order to increase tax revenue, the administration has already submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Finance to universally implement the consumption special tax on retail goods and banquets/hotels in all counties and towns, as well as rural areas, of the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, in addition to the counties and towns where the consumption special tax has already been implemented, starting from May 16th of this year. All consumption special taxes previously levied by the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance will be transferred to the local tax authorities under the administration for collection starting from the 16th. If there are any tax authorities that have not been established in various regions, the administration may entrust the provincial, municipal, and county governments to collect them. It is reported that tax authorities have already been established in the three provinces and cities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in towns and rural areas.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Navy's Strategic Offensive Is Destined to Be a Bubble, Analysis of General Trends by Minister Matsushima</h3>
<p>At a reception for Chinese reporters held by the Press Department of the Japanese Fleet in China yesterday at 3:00 PM, Minister Matsushima delivered a speech on the strategic offensive of the U.S. Navy. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Forced by the Situation to Launch an Offensive</p>
<p>The strategic offensive of the U.S. Navy is gradually approaching. On May 10th, Admiral Kinkaid, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied U.S. Fleet in the Kinmen area, Admiral Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, and Admiral Halsey, Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces, held an operational conference. The result of the conference was to decide to prepare to use the U.S. fleet to destroy the Japanese fleet from now on, which is becoming increasingly obvious. The reason for the enemy's active counteroffensive can be assumed to be that their domestic situation is urgent, and they must actively counterattack.</p>
<p>Production Capacity Shows a Decline</p>
<p>First, the U.S. production capacity has reached its saturation point, and recently there has been a decline. Recently, Wilson, Chairman of the U.S. Aviation Planning Committee, announced that U.S. aircraft production in April was lower than in March. Aircraft production in March was 8,340, and in April it decreased significantly.</p>
<p>The U.S. has never announced the losses of the navy since the start of the war. Recently, due to repeated requests from the American people, the U.S. government began to announce them. However, the numbers announced by the U.S. are far from those announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. Based on factual judgments, the number of losses announced is less than half of the actual number. The reason for not announcing it for a long time is nothing more than to conceal the magnitude of the actual losses in order to reduce public concern. The U.S. has always claimed to maintain price parity, but now it feels a lack of supplies, and there is panic over wartime life. The number of labor strikes in the United States is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Dreaming of Success with Reckless Actions</p>
<p>Second, Roosevelt's presidential election is approaching in July. Because the re-election period is approaching, he is rushing to counterattack, hoping to succeed in one fell swoop. The U.S. has always concealed the actual situation of the war and only adopted the so-called "reckless tiger crossing the river" tactics. Therefore, the U.S. military has exposed many shortcomings in the first few battles. The enemy believes that the most important front line is from New Guinea to the Philippines, and then from the Philippines to the Luo Nan-Guangdong area. Now they are transporting as much naval, land, and air force as possible, preparing to destroy the Japanese army. In modern warfare, the distance between the battlefield and the supply base is extremely important due to transportation relations, especially since the United States relies solely on material power for combat. With such difficulties, it is self-evident that they cannot win. The Japanese side has ample strength and is waiting in full force for the enemy to attack the inner line. It has confidence and is not worried.</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, a Philadelphia telegraph reported that Harold Meson, who planned to assassinate Roosevelt on the 9th, has been arrested.</p>
<p>Conspiracy Lies Fall Apart</p>
<p>Recently, the U.S. has been conducting propaganda in Shanghai, creating various rumors, such as: Marshal Koga committed suicide, alienating Japanese-German and Japanese-Soviet relations, strengthening British and American forces, weakening Japanese pressure, and annihilating Japan. The following are answers to the above rumors:</p>
<p>There is no need to explain the reason for Marshal Koga's death. In short, anyone who commits suicide must have a weak heart. How can a person with a weak will take on the responsibility of a general? This kind of rumor was created by Chongqing and falls apart by itself.</p>
<p>Regarding Japanese-Soviet relations, especially the closeness of Japanese-Soviet relations, the signing of the previous Oshima-Hirota Soviet-Japanese Fishery Agreement and the concession of oil and mineral rights both prove the closeness of Japanese-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Regarding the strength of the British and American forces, according to Wilson, the U.S. production in April decreased compared to March. Its strength can be imagined. On the contrary, Japan is using the production of China and various southern regions. This year, the production of ships has exceeded five or six times the previous amount.</p>
<p>Regarding the annihilation of Japan, the Japanese people have always held the spirit of "fighting to the last ditch." Rather than "retreating to await death," it is better to "advance to overcome." This kind of rumor will only encourage the Japanese people's hatred and anger.</p>

<h3>Appeal to the Authorities of the Fourth District to Rectify the Rationing Agencies</h3>
<p>— Yale</p>
<p>All citizens residing in the Fourth District express dissatisfaction when talking about the rationing situation in the local township office. For example, citizens who have newly moved into the district, after completing the household registration procedures and obtaining the residence permit, the household registration must have been reported by the neighborhood chief long ago. Then, logically, the ration coupons for household items, such as rice, flour, oil, and soap, should be issued in the shortest possible time, just like in the first and second districts. However, citizens in the Fourth District have to wait another two or three months, or even half a year, after moving in before they can receive the rationed items. Moreover, items like household sugar are further delayed. The author lives in the Fourth District and has also been affected by this. Although there are many bad neighborhood chiefs, the chief of my neighborhood is honest and upright, and praised by the citizens. He should not be embezzling the rations. Whether the township office is embezzling the public's needs is unknown, but people are talking about it, indicating that there must be abuses. I hope the authorities will pay attention to rectification to prevent unscrupulous people from increasing the burden and anger of the citizens.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the past situation, let's take the recent distribution of household soap as an example. The Fourth District began distributing the second batch of household soap on the 6th of this month. The price of the Scissors brand soap was set at 38 yuan, which is 6.5 yuan higher per bar than the same brand of soap recently distributed in the First District. The notice issued by the township office at the entrance of the distributor stated that it was due to cost factors. However, the prices of other rationed items are exactly the same as those in the First District. Since they are all under the same rationing agency in Shanghai, it is reasonable for the prices of rationed items to be uniform.</p>
<p>In recent years, the authorities have spared no effort in issuing price limits for various items. Why is it that the price of rationed items under the unified control agency is instead allowed to increase? Moreover, the soap distributed on the same day in the Fourth District and the First District differed greatly in price, which is deeply puzzling to the citizens. I sincerely hope that the authorities will uphold their credibility and gain the support of the people.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>From the next day onwards, Tatsuo stayed at the painter's house in the city, serving as an apprentice. He swept the courtyard, heated the bathwater, went out to buy things, and delivered and picked up items.</p>
<p>After a month, he discovered that the painter, who seemed extremely indifferent, was the most affectionate person. At the same time, he also understood that the painter's wife was a self-willed woman with mental problems. Because she had no children, the wife often wore extremely fashionable Western clothes and went out. However, every time she went out, she always asked Tatsuo to shine her shoes, which made Tatsuo feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>(Damn it, shining shoes for a woman is unlucky for ten thousand years.)</p>
<p>The temper of a Kagoshima man flared up. However, at that time, for the sake of learning, he had to swallow his anger.</p>
<p>He only focused on practicing sketching. He meticulously sketched everything he saw with charcoal and pencil. When he had accumulated a considerable number, he sent them to the painter for criticism.</p>
<p>"The most important thing is sketching. Work hard!"</p>
<p>Apart from this, there were no other comments. However, Ichiki recognized that Tatsuo had artistic talent. This could also be seen from Ichiki's facial expressions.</p>
<p>After this, Tatsuo truly felt the fun of art. Even when he saw an apple or a blade of grass, he couldn't help but want to draw them. He finally obtained his teacher's permission and began to play with oil paints.</p>
<p>The first still life he drew, he felt in his heart, would definitely be scolded. However, when he took it to Ichiki, he was praised instead, who said:</p>
<p>"Humph, the colors are very well applied."</p>
<p>One day, Tatsuo and Ichiki went on a sketching trip together. It was his responsibility to carry the luggage and equipment. However, after arriving at the destination, he could also set up his easel not far from his teacher.</p>
<p>"Your paintings, in terms of being more skilled, are quite interesting. People generally say that I have the skill of a master, but you are even more skilled than me!"</p>
<p>Ichiki looked at the paintings that Tatsuo had drawn and said this kindly.</p>
<p>From Tatsuo's perspective, he could not feel the difference between skill and novelty. He was not yet able to understand the trends in the art world. He was simply painting the beauty he saw in his eyes as it was.</p>
<p>Since Ichiki began to seriously guide him, Tatsuo's paintings have been steadily improving. When the teacher was not at home, he could also use the painting room. So he unfolded the huge canvas and began to paint. However, the more diligent he was, the more Ichiki's wife disliked him. This was because he could not take care of the apprentice's tasks.</p>
<p>In the spring of the second year, due to his wife's suggestion, Tatsuo had to leave Ichiki's house. The wife found another apprentice, and the painter Ichiki also found another job for Tatsuo.</p>

<h3>Exchanging Labor for Reward to Donate to Children in Need</h3>
<p>To Whom It May Concern: My friend, Mrs. So-and-so, is a kind and virtuous lady who is devoted to public welfare. She usually not only encourages good deeds but also willingly helps the poor. In the past, she donated a large amount of money without using her name to help orphans and widows. Recently, she has been working hard to promote the products of a certain factory, hoping to achieve her wish of "contributing both effort and money." This sum of 900 yuan, which is the "reward" she earned for her "labor" – the commission for March – is now specifically donated to your organization to be used as assistance for needy children. Please issue a receipt in the name of "anonymous commission" so that it can be kept for safekeeping. Sincerely, Jin Yiqi</p>
<p>Note: The purpose of our organization's aid fund for needy children is to rescue helpless children and give them opportunities to learn skills so that they can become self-reliant and useful members of society. Now, an anonymous lady donates 900 yuan earned through her labor as aid for needy children. Her kindness, compassion, and dedication to public welfare are worthy of promotion in society. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will emulate the anonymous lady's righteous act, not hesitate to take responsibility, and contribute enthusiastically.</p>
