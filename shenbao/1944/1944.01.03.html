<p>社評</p>
<h3>刷新司法</h3>
<p>據南京一日中央社電，前上海地方檢察署檢察長陳秉鈞等，因瀆職收賄案件，經首都高等法院審理終結，各判處有期徒刑，同時賄款四十萬元，仍向陳秉鈞追繳</p>
<p>我們對於這一消息，發生兩點感想，第一，司法當局對於屬員瀆職，不徇私情，依法懲處，這種決心與精神，不僅在輓近司法界中尚少前見，尤其在輓近官塲中更屬少見，是嚴肅官常上值得稱道的一事。第二，近來我們屢屢聽到司法界，尤其是政治界公務人員瀆職的傳言，所傳自非盡虛。經過陳秉鈞案件的懲處，給予若輩以當頭棒喝，使不良分子知所炯戒，因而澄淸官常。可是，澈底嚴肅官常，使政治上弊絕風淸，仍有待於高級官吏的不徇私情，以身作則。司法官員，如再以身試法，則為知法犯法，絕難諉說誤犯，應得之罪，實較常人尤重，豈可不愼。</p>
<p>此外，治外法權收回以後，司法地位，益為重要。我們聯想到司法上與革的幾點，以供參攷：</p>
<p>肅淸司法官員的瀆職，對於待遇首須顧到，誠如新任司法行政部長張一鵬氏，在本報去年七月廿五日星期評論中所說：「低級法官至少須與黃包車夫收入相等；中級法官至少須與理髮匠收入相等，高級法官至少須與一般商店公司經理收入相等。」如果法官所入，未能顧及全家生活，必其枵腹從公，而不作非分之想，亦是難事。當然我們不是說，因法官待遇太薄，瀆職即可原諒，不過，因待遇不足生活，是為瀆職因素之一，尤其是下級員警，寶非無因。因此，增加司法經費，提高司法官員待遇，實為整頓司法嚴肅官常首要之勝。</p>
<p>司法檢察職權，以上海而言，自租界接收後，過去捕房牽制之畸形事實，應不復見於今日，可是，警察局與檢察署之間，尚未合理調整，事資上檢察制度仍未健全，以致檢察職權，仍未能充分發揮效用。我們認為司法警察在檢察程序中有相當重要地位，欲求整個檢察制度確立，則司法警察必須充實組織，檢察官才可指揮司法警察，運用職權。而警局對於刑事案件，尤須依照法律，與檢察署取得密切聯絡，尊重司法獨立。</p>
<p>張一鵬氏為司法界前輩，從光緒三十二年開始在司法界服務，迄今三十八年，此次出長法部，對於司法上應興應革，經騐宏富，胸有成竹，自母庸我們借箸代謀，不過，我們熱烈期待張氏者，能於在野時所有主張，一一實現，確立司法界永遠之基石，幸甚。</p>
<h3>中樞元旦團拜禮在國府隆重舉行　溫院長主持並致懇摯訓詞</h3>
<p>南京一日中央社電　今一日為中華民國三十三年元旦日，一元復始，萬象更新，尤以際茲中日同盟條約簽訂，大東亞共同宣言之後，迎此三十三年元且，中日友好關係之增進，有更光輝之途徑，東亞各國民族之聯絡，有更明允之準則，而大東並戰爭決戰之勝利，亦有更確實之把握，中國獨立，東亞解放，於此更有可靠之保障，瞻望前途，誠感無限光明。是日全國除同深慶祝外，首都全市，亦咸縣旗熱烈慶賀，迎取此決戰勝利年。中樞特於是日上午十時在國府大禮堂，隆重舉行慶祝卅三軍元且團拜大典，到國府委員及各院部會處長官，暨各機關高級文武官員二百餘人，文官着國民禮服。或籃袍黑掛，佩勳表，武官則御軍服，佩刀佩勳表。十時正，慶祝元旦團拜大典，在軍樂鏗鏘聲中隆重展幕由國府委員兼司法院院長溫宗堯氏主持，領導全體行禮如儀後，旋致訓詞，語至懇摯。繼由各院部會處長官，遙向主席一鞠躬禮，各院部會處長官，相向行一鞠躬禮。最後由溫院長領導全體三呼中華民國萬歲及歡呼主席萬歲，一時歡聲雷震，全塲充滿熱烈歡欣情緒，歷時數十分鐘，此隆重嚴肅之慶祝元旦大典，始於樂聲悠揚中，宣告禮成散會。</p>
<p>溫院長致詞</p>
<p>南京一日中央社電　一日爲三十三年元旦，中樞特於是日舉行團拜大典，由國府委員兼司法院長溫宗堯氏主持，溫氏並致訓詞如下：</p>
<p>各位長官，各位同仁，今日為三十三年元旦良辰，齊集慶祝，異常愉快。蓋以今日之慶祝，異於往日，其所以異者，中日兩國已成立平等互應之邦交，而締結同盟條約，並東亞各國家又已發表共同宣言，從今以後我東亞各國家確已達到聯合提携共同發展之關係。國父孫先生之大亞洲主義，可謂已經完成，而且我最高領袖汪主席宣佈參戰，已滿一年，我同仁在此新年歲首必定另有一番新感想及一番新振作。古語有云，一年之計在於春，今逢獻歲新春，希望從此振刷精神，努力奮進，以促進興華保亞之成功，謹遙祝主席政躬康泰，並祝諸位健康。</p>
<h3>完遂大東亞戰爭日首相表明决意　前晚對各國作廣播演說</h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　日天皇陛下一日晨五時半，執行四方拜坐典，並遙拜畝傍桃山御陵及多摩御陵等四方之天地神位，祈念邦國昌隆，國民多幸及日軍之勝利。又日天皇皂后兩陸下曾同於鳳鳳間與各皇族殿下交換新年祝辭，並於正殿受東條首相以次文武百官之拜賀，下午一時半受各外國使節等之祝賀。日一億國民無分男女老幼，均於是日上午九時之國民奉祝時間，於各自所在地點分別作必勝祈禱，宮城二重橋前國民接踵而至，默禱聖壽無疆，參拜明治神宮，靖國神社者，亦絡續不絕。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日東條首相一日下午七時二十分對大東亞各國廣播，表明日本完遂大東亞戰爭之決意及強調月本與諸關邦之提携，其要旨如次：大東亞戰爭之目的，乃在謀求日本之自存自衛，進而確保東亞之安定，確立萬國共榮之世界秩序，故日本之目的所在，亦為大東亞十億民族之共同理想。去年十一月大東亞會議所議之大東亞宣言，已將東亞之共同理想闡明於全世界，今滿洲國正以防衛大東亞之基地，協力日本完遂戰爭，中國於去年十月亦適應大東亞新情勢，與日本締結盟約，確立其自主獨立及中，日永好關係，共同邁進於擊減英。美之途。泰國於去年入月已達成其夙願，擴大領土，與日本相携，綢續向共同之戰爭目的邁進。他如緬甸，於去年八月已宣告獨立，繼之十月菲律賓國誕生，東亞解放之大業相繼見諸實現，今則緬甸國已立於防衛大東亞之第一綫，勇敢奮鬥，菲律賓亦舉其總力協力戰爭，爪哇及其他各地原住民之參政，亦逐步實現。此等原住民對戰爭之協力日益增强，吾人對於此等爲完成大東亞戰爭而獻身之大東亞各國，各民族，衷心不勝感激，於此願重行表明吾人之甚深謝意。目前戰局因英美之反攻極其巖重，然日本一億國民業各就戰鬥之位邁入減敵之途，即十億民衆亦已奮然倔起，排擊英美之非望，值此戰情險惡之秋，歐洲之盟邦始終與吾等同履一途，封鎖敵人之反攻，英美欲制霸世界之野望，已全被擊摧矣。吾等必勝之念，因而愈趨鞏固，當此新春伊始，在輝煌之戰爭目的下，吾等更期與東西兩盟邦堅固團結，共同完成此曠古大業。</p>
<h3>東綫德軍續採　彈性防禦戰　齊托米爾市德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德軍當局一日發表：德軍於基輔西方要衝齊托米爾激戰後，已自該市撤退</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國新聞社東綫軍事特派員哈瑪上校稱：東綫戰事焦點，仍在齊托米爾區，紅軍在該處以槍兵三十至三十五師團與坦克車數百輛加入作戰，德守軍再度以彈性之防籞戰術退阻蘇軍，僅貝迪契夫區一處，蘇軍進攻之坦克車三百輛中，已有五十五輛被擊毀，德軍戰鬥數小時後，由齊托米爾廢墟撤退　蘇軍在齊托米爾之冬季大戰中·損失坦克九七輛，在東側面蘇軍復向尼柯波爾橋頭堡進攻，紅軍雖經重砲隊準備後在主力機數百架掩護之下，以槍兵六師團與坦克車一師團發動進攻，但德守軍早有準備，予以迎頭痛擊，而獲得防禦上完全之勝利，激戰中敵坦克車被擎毀不下二十二輛，結果德軍仍堅守各陣地。</p>
<h3>義境戰事膠着　陣地無變化</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　德國新開社地中海區特派員柏勒納稱：南義之聯事活動，星期五日已見減弱，米納諾之北與菲利納諾之西，克拉克將軍之都隊向該處之德軍陣地進攻，但尙未抵達德陣綫之前，再度為德軍所擊退。美第五軍目下似乎正在全力補充其最近所受人力與物質之損失，南　前綫東部沿海岸附近之德軍，再度遭蒙高茂萊將軍之英帝國軍隊襲擊，但德步兵與平射砲集中之防禦砲火，終於擊退敵軍，英第入軍在此次進攻中，損失「旭門」坦克車四輛。</p>

<h3>奉賢截獲　私米出境</h3>
<p>中央社訊　國府寶施米糧統制以來，旨在防杜奸商，囤積牟利，安定民食，乃查各地米糧，往往逃過收貝，私自偷運，殊屬破壞糧食統制政策，實堪痛恨，滋據中央社記者探悉，奉賢區方面，日前有白米二千擔，企圖偷運出境，惟事機不密，為駐紮該處之中央稅警團　獲，除依法懲處外，並為難護民食起見，決將該項白米，依據戶口米價，在高地發售，嘉惠民衆。</p>

<h3>Refreshing the Judiciary</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, Chen Bingjun, former Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, and others were found guilty of dereliction of duty and accepting bribes. After trial by the Capital High Court, they were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment. At the same time, the bribe money of 400,000 yuan is still being recovered from Chen Bingjun.</p>
<p>Regarding this news, we have two thoughts. First, the judicial authorities do not condone dereliction of duty by their subordinates, but punish them according to the law. This kind of determination and spirit is not only rare in the recent judicial world, but even rarer in the recent officialdom. It is a commendable matter in upholding official discipline. Second, recently we have repeatedly heard rumors of dereliction of duty by people in the judicial sector, especially political officials. What is spread is not entirely false. The punishment of Chen Bingjun's case serves as a head-on blow to such people, so that bad elements know how to be wary and thus purify officialdom. However, to thoroughly uphold official discipline and make politics free from corruption and clean, it still depends on senior officials not showing favoritism and setting an example. If judicial officials try the law themselves again, then it is knowingly breaking the law. It is absolutely difficult to shirk responsibility for unintentional offenses. The crimes they deserve are actually more serious than ordinary people, so how can they not be careful.</p>
<p>In addition, after the recovery of extraterritorial rights, the status of the judiciary is even more important. We are reminded of several points regarding judicial reform for reference:</p>
<p>To eliminate dereliction of duty by judicial officials, attention must first be paid to their treatment. As the newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Zhang Yipeng, said in his weekly commentary in this newspaper on July 25th of last year: "Lower-level judges must have an income at least equal to that of rickshaw pullers; middle-level judges must have an income at least equal to that of barbers; and senior judges must have an income at least equal to that of general store and company managers." If the income of judges cannot take care of the whole family's livelihood, it will be difficult for them to serve the public with an empty stomach without having improper thoughts. Of course, we are not saying that dereliction of duty can be excused because the treatment of judges is too low. However, insufficient income to support life is one of the factors of dereliction of duty, especially for lower-level police officers, which is certainly not without reason. Therefore, increasing judicial funding and improving the treatment of judicial officials is the primary key to rectifying the judiciary and upholding official discipline.</p>
<p>Regarding the authority of judicial prosecution, taking Shanghai as an example, after the recovery of the concessions, the abnormal situation of being constrained by the patrol房 (police station) in the past should no longer be seen today. However, a reasonable adjustment has not yet been made between the police局 (police department) and the檢察署 (procuratorate). In fact, the prosecution system is still not sound, so that the authority of prosecution still cannot be fully effective. We believe that the judicial police have a very important position in the prosecution process. To establish the entire prosecution system, the judicial police must be strengthened in organization so that the prosecutor can command the judicial police and exercise their powers. The police department must also, in accordance with the law, establish close contact with the procuratorate and respect judicial independence for criminal cases.</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng is a senior figure in the judicial circle. He has been serving in the judicial circle since the thirty-second year of Guangxu, and has been doing so for thirty-eight years. This time, he has become the head of the Ministry of Law, and he has a wealth of experience and a clear plan for what should be done and what should be reformed in the judiciary. It is unnecessary for us to offer unsolicited advice. However, we eagerly expect Zhang to realize all the proposals he made when he was out of office and establish a permanent cornerstone for the judicial circle. This would be fortunate.</p>
<h3>The Central Government's New Year's Day Group Worship Ceremony was Solemnly Held at the National Government. President Wen Presided and Delivered a Cordial Speech.</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, today, the 1st, is New Year's Day of the thirty-third year of the Republic of China. It is the beginning of a new year, and everything is renewed. Especially after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, welcoming this thirty-third year's New Year, the promotion of friendly relations between China and Japan has a more glorious path, the connection between the nations of East Asia has a clearer standard, and the victory of the decisive battle of the Greater East Asia War is also more certain. The independence of China and the liberation of East Asia have more reliable guarantees. Looking forward to the future, we sincerely feel infinite light. On this day, in addition to the nationwide celebration, the entire capital city also hung flags to warmly celebrate, welcoming this year of decisive victory. The central government specially held a grand celebration of the thirty-third military New Year's Day group worship ceremony in the auditorium of the National Government at 10:00 am. More than 200 members of the National Government and heads of various ministries and departments, as well as senior civil and military officials of various agencies, attended. Civil officials wore national礼服 (national dress), or blue robes and black jackets, with medals; military officials wore military uniforms, with swords and medals. At 10:00 am, the celebration of the New Year's Day group worship ceremony was grandly unveiled in the sound of military music. It was presided over by Wen Zongyao, member of the National Government and President of the Judicial Yuan, who led the entire group to perform the ceremony as usual, and then delivered a speech, which was very cordial. Then, the heads of various ministries and departments bowed to the Chairman, and the heads of various ministries and departments bowed to each other. Finally, President Wen led the entire group to shout "Long live the Republic of China" and "Long live the Chairman" three times. For a time, cheers resounded, and the whole audience was filled with enthusiastic and joyful emotions. Lasting for several tens of minutes, this grand and solemn celebration of the New Year's Day ceremony was announced to be over in the melodious music.</p>
<p>President Wen's Speech</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, the 1st is New Year's Day of the thirty-third year. The central government specially held a group worship ceremony on this day, presided over by Wen Zongyao, member of the National Government and President of the Judicial Yuan. Wen also delivered a speech as follows:</p>
<p>Respected officials, colleagues, today is the auspicious day of New Year's Day of the thirty-third year. It is a great pleasure to gather to celebrate. Because today's celebration is different from the past. The reason for the difference is that China and Japan have established equal and mutually responsive diplomatic relations and concluded an alliance treaty. Moreover, the countries of East Asia have also issued a joint declaration. From now on, the countries of East Asia have indeed achieved a relationship of joint cooperation and common development. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism can be said to have been completed, and it has been a year since our supreme leader Chairman Wang announced his participation in the war. My colleagues must have a new feeling and a new spirit at the beginning of this new year. As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." Now that we are at the beginning of the year, I hope that we will renew our spirits and work hard to promote the success of reviving China and protecting Asia. I wish Chairman Wang good health and all of you good health.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister Expressed his Determination to Complete the Greater East Asia War. He Gave a Broadcast Speech to Various Countries the Night Before.</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 1st, at 5:30 am on the 1st, the Japanese Emperor performed the ceremony of worshiping the four directions, and remotely worshiped the gods of heaven and earth in the four directions, including the Mausoleum of Emperor Jinmu and the Mausoleum of Emperor Meiji, praying for the prosperity of the country, the happiness of the people, and the victory of the Japanese army. The Emperor and Empress also exchanged New Year's greetings with the princes and princesses in the 鳳凰間 (Phoenix Room), and received the New Year's greetings from Prime Minister Tojo and other civil and military officials in the main hall at 1:30 pm received the New Year's greetings from foreign envoys. On the morning of the 1st, 100 million Japanese people, regardless of gender, age, or young, made prayers for certain victory at their respective locations during the national celebration time at 9:00 am. People flocked to the Nijubashi Bridge in front of the Imperial Palace, silently praying for the Emperor's longevity. People who visited the Meiji Shrine and the Yasukuni Shrine also came in an endless stream.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Tokyo on the 2nd, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo broadcast to the countries of Greater East Asia at 7:20 pm on the 1st, expressing Japan's determination to complete the Greater East Asia War and emphasizing the cooperation between Japan and the countries concerned. The main points are as follows: The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to seek Japan's self-existence and self-defense, and to ensure the stability of East Asia and establish a world order of mutual prosperity for all nations. Therefore, Japan's goal is also the common ideal of the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. The Greater East Asia Declaration discussed at the Greater East Asia Conference in November last year has clarified the common ideals of East Asia to the world. Today, Manchuria is cooperating with Japan to complete the war as a base for defending Greater East Asia. China also adapted to the new situation in Greater East Asia in October last year, concluding a treaty of alliance with Japan, establishing its autonomy and independence, and the eternal friendship between China and Japan, and jointly moving forward on the road to defeating Britain and the United States. Thailand achieved its long-cherished wish in January last year, expanding its territory and joining hands with Japan, continuing to move towards the common war goals. As for Burma, it declared its independence in August last year, followed by the birth of the Republic of the Philippines in October. The great cause of East Asian liberation has been realized one after another. Today, Burma stands on the front line of defending Greater East Asia and bravely fights. The Philippines is also exerting its full strength to cooperate in the war. The participation of the natives of Java and other places in politics is also gradually being realized. The cooperation of these natives in the war is increasing day by day. We are sincerely grateful to the countries and nations of Greater East Asia who have dedicated themselves to completing the Greater East Asia War. Here, I would like to reiterate our deepest gratitude. At present, the war situation is extremely difficult due to the counterattack of Britain and the United States. However, 100 million Japanese people have entered the path of defeating the enemy in their respective combat positions, and 1 billion people have also risen up to repel the unrealistic ambitions of Britain and the United States. At this time of dangerous war, the allied countries in Europe have always been on the same path as us, blocking the enemy's counterattack. The ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world has been completely defeated. Our determination to win is becoming more and more solid. At the beginning of this new year, under the glorious war goals, we look forward to strengthening solidarity with the allies in the East and the West and jointly completing this unprecedented undertaking.</p>
<h3>The German Army on the Eastern Front Continues to Adopt Elastic Defense Tactics. The German Army Withdraws from the City of Zhytomyr.</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin on the 2nd, the German military authorities announced on the 1st that the German army had withdrawn from Zhytomyr, a vital point west of Kiev, after fierce fighting.</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin on the 2nd, Colonel Hama, a military correspondent on the Eastern Front for the German News Agency, said: The focus of the Eastern Front war is still in the Zhytomyr area. The Red Army has added 30 to 35 divisions of infantry and hundreds of tanks to the battle there. The German defenders are again using elastic defense tactics to resist the Soviet army. In the Berdychiv area alone, 55 of the 300 tanks attacking the Soviet army have been destroyed. After several hours of fighting, the German army withdrew from the ruins of Zhytomyr. The Soviet army lost 97 tanks in the Zhytomyr winter battle. On the eastern side, the Soviet army again attacked the Nikopol bridgehead. Although the Red Army had prepared with heavy artillery and under the cover of hundreds of main fighters, and launched an attack with six infantry divisions and one tank division, the German defenders were prepared and gave them a head-on blow, achieving a complete victory in defense. No fewer than 22 enemy tanks were destroyed in the fierce fighting. As a result, the German army still firmly defended its positions.</p>
<h3>The War in Italy is at a Stalemate. No Changes in the Trenches.</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Berlin on the 2nd, Berner, a special correspondent for the German News Agency in the Mediterranean region, said: The Allied military activities in southern Italy have weakened on Friday. North of Minano and west of Filignano, General Clark's troops attacked the German positions there, but before reaching the German front line, they were again repelled by the German army. The US Fifth Army seems to be fully replenishing its recent losses in manpower and materials. On the eastern coast of the southern front, the German army was again attacked by General Montgomery's British Empire troops, but the concentrated defensive artillery fire of the German infantry and flat-shooting guns finally repelled the enemy army. In this attack, the British 8th Army lost four "Sherman" tanks.</p>
<h3>US Ship Sunk</h3>

<h3>Measures for Temporary Reopening of Dance Industry in the Capital</h3>
<p>According to a dispatch from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 1st, after youth students initiated the anti-drug movement, the two dance halls in the capital, the International Dance Hall and the New Asia Club, immediately suspended their dance business. However, due to the sudden implementation, the employees not only suddenly became unemployed, but their lives would inevitably be panicked. In addition, the end of the year is approaching, and even if they want to change careers in a short period of time, it is not easy. They have successively applied to the municipal government and the police superintendent's office for temporary reopening. Yesterday (the 31st) afternoon, Director Lin, Mayor Zhou, and Police Superintendent Li consulted and specially formulated three measures and ordered them to be strictly followed. The first measure is to allow a 15-day extension to end, that is, from today to January 15, the reopening is temporarily allowed. From January 16, business will be suspended, and no further requests will be made. The second measure is to absolutely prohibit early dances, noon dances, tea dances, etc. The dance business hours are limited to two hours per day, from 9:30 pm to 11:30 pm. No early starts or extensions are allowed. The third measure is that civil servants and students have always been prohibited from dancing, and strict attention should be paid to this. The cadres in charge of the anti-drug movement's headquarters must be given detailed explanations at any time.</p>

<h3>Fengxian Intercepts Private Rice Smuggling Out of the Country.</h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, since the National Government implemented rice and grain control, the aim is to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding for profit and stabilize the people's food supply. However, rice and grain in various places often escape collection and are secretly transported, which is destroying the food control policy and is really hateful. According to information from a Central News Agency reporter, in the Fengxian area, 2,000 dan of white rice were recently attempted to be smuggled out of the country. However, the plot was discovered by the Central Tax Police Corps stationed there. In addition to punishing them according to the law, and for the sake of protecting the people's food supply, it was decided to sell the white rice in high-lying areas at household registration rice prices to benefit the people.</p>

<h3>Stations Along the Jinghu, Bengbu, and Pukou Lines Have Stopped Inspecting Travelers. Orders Have Been Issued to Various Agencies to Comply.</h3>
<p>According to Central News Agency, it has been almost four years since the National Government returned to the capital. The central military and political authorities have actively promoted the stabilization of people's livelihood and the establishment of public security, and have achieved very significant results. Previously, in order to adapt to the current environment, checkpoints were set up in various city gates and river ports to expose treacherous people who disrupt public security and petty criminals who disrupt order, which contributed greatly to maintaining public security. Now that the public security in the peaceful area has reached stability through the efforts of our military police personnel, and lawless traitors have disappeared, in order to facilitate travel, from January 1, 1944, all stations and river ports on the Jinghu Line, and all stations and river ports between Pukou and Bengbu on the Jinqing Line, as well as the key points of various city gates, have stopped inspection. It is also not necessary to get out of the car for inspection when passing through the city gates, which provides great convenience to travelers. However, if military police personnel find anything suspicious, they should be strictly interrogated, and merchants and civilians must not refuse inspection. This measure has been ordered by the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to be implemented by various local agencies. Therefore, public security in various places will be even better in the future, and the people's peaceful life will be further promoted.</p>

<h3>Today's First Division Football: Donghua vs. Qiaolian. The Matches on the Previous Two Days Were Postponed.</h3>
<p>Due to the bad weather, the New Year's football match was not held on New Year's Day and yesterday. Today is the last day of the New Year holiday. There are six matches of varying sizes. In addition to the Mayor's Cup match between Jewish and Youlian, the most notable match is the final match of the first round of the first division between Donghua and Qiaolian this afternoon. It is learned that Qiaolian's strength has been greatly enhanced since the arrival of the Italian general. Today, Qiaolian could have done its best to compete with Donghua, but suddenly news came that the Italian general was tired and still used the original team of Qiaolian in pure color. In this way, a good football match has lost a lot of interest.</p>

<h3>A Year's Plan</h3>
<p>"A year's plan starts in the spring." What we expect this year is the economic prosperity within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the important part we occupy must first be consolidated through efforts. Therefore, the plan for the year must start today. The various diseases of the economic world in the past should be regarded as starting yesterday. We can only recognize where the past diseases lie and start our new economic life from now on.</p>
<p>A year's plan has thousands of threads, so where should we start? Weighing the pros and cons, the issue of food consumption and production is ultimately more important than everything else. The common people have already tasted enough of it in the past year. Therefore, the economic plan in our planned economy this year must first plan to solve the problem of food consumption and production. How to gradually increase the ration of food consumption? How to fully launch the driving force of food production? Do not let this year's food consumption and production go down the road to the end, which is what we most earnestly hope for. In addition to regularly reporting on the various trends of agriculture, industry and commerce, this column will, as far as the size of the issue allows, contribute its modest efforts to this issue at any time.</p>
<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>During the Chinese stock market holiday, over-the-counter trading of China &amp; West Dispensary and Star Company shares showed considerable strength. China &amp; West was quoted at fifty dollars, and Star Company once reached thirty-five dollars. This was reportedly because of news that China &amp; West's thirty-two dollar dividend would be paid out in advance, and that a five-dollar coupon would also be issued per share. Correction: In the Japanese section's report on Chinese stocks, the New Asia Construction share price was a typographical error. The actual price was thirty dollars. We hereby correct it.</p>
