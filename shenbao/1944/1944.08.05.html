<p>社評</p>
<h3>戶口米恢復配給以後</h3>
<p>本市戶口米即將恢復配給，已由市政當局暨盟邦大使館滬事務所當　分別發表談話，正式表示。我們在昨日短評中，已經略論其實義的重大。米糧問題我們始終認定是民生問題中最主要者，因此，我們在過去不憚煩厭的反覆申論，每見當局的措置有欠妥當時，輒不辭冒凍，嚴詞批評。我們立言的基本態度，即以改善民生為中心，那末，對於民命所依的米糧問題，自然不能忽視了。所以，我們仍本這個態度，再貢管見如次：</p>
<p>檢討過去一年間的米糧問題，簡單的說，在處理紊亂中逐漸惡化。一方面，一部分人利用機會，追求暴利，不惜抬高米價，誠如陳市長哦：「南京和上海同是都會，相隔祇有六小時的火車，我眞不解何以南京今日米價在三千元左右，而上海會達至萬元，我想還不止是人謀之不臧，竟直是人謀故意使之不臧。」就是說上海米價的高漲，是人為的原因，也就是暴利者的投機促成。不過，投機者的技倆得逞，一定先有了被利用的環境，才會乘隙以進。所謂物必自腐，然後虫生。譬如過去不久米統會實施五斗米以上即予征購辦法，就是給予投機者抬價的機會，於是米價狂跳。至於還有一部分人，假藉職務上的特殊權力或便利，勾結奸商，逕行舞弊，使米價抬高，從中獲利。例如巳發覺的顧周后胡案件，及未發覺的類如顧周案件。</p>
<p>一方面則用消極的補救方法，以期壓平米價，但效力微薄。例如本市市政府咨請米統會改爲十石以下不予征購。社會輿論請求放棄徵購，以疏米源，對於米價回跌，雖見機效，但正義力量始終不能消滅投機氣氛。處理一件事，小心盡力，而結果利少弊多或有害無益，這是「人謀不臧」，則在某種程度而言，於情尚有可原。處理一件事，存心不良，盡力作歹，結果必然無利有弊，無益有害，這就是「人謀故意使之不藏」，則無論如何，不可原諒的。</p>
<p>過去一年間，上海市民就在米價步步高漲的壓迫之下，掙扎着喘不過氣的生活，可是，上海市民依然以最艱苦的情緒忍耐生活。為什麼呢？因為上海是大東亞戰爭中後方重要基地，維獲治安，最為重要，市民人人有此責任，人人有此認識。不過，市民忍受艱苦生活也有限度的，完全視乎當局善為把握了。</p>
<p>現在盟邦軍隊在潮南大捷，「湖廣熟，天下足」，湖南產米豐稔佔全國第三位，所以，這次湘戰勝利，佔領米穀豐產地帶以後，可以輸運一部分米糧補救後方民食。在此靑黃不接之時，地此補救，恢復配給，實爲最好時機，在經濟上政治上均有重大的意義。</p>
<p>然而，配給必須畏期，端賴來源不絕。所以恢復配給，還是治標的方法。治本之道，我們認為仍在不久新殼上市，如何統籌收買，訂定價格？如何根據過去失敗經驗，研究今後合理方案，實爲今日當務之急。欲期民食問題整個妥善解決，關係當局尤應從速注意及之</p>
<h3>日首相定期廣播　述完遂戰爭決意　昨晨閣議重光氏報吿外交</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日內閣四日上午十時，在首相官邸舉行定例閣議，小磯首相以下各閣員全體出席，關於預定木月八日闡明政府完逐戰爭決意事，決定由小磯首相於八日以無綫電廣播，其後重光外相報吿最近外交問題，至下午零時四十分散會。</p>
<h3>琉黃島及父島空襲　迭尼安島激戰敵軍損失重大</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　中部太平洋某基地電，敵艦上機羣，曾於四日上午分別以有力編隊來襲硫黃島兩次，父島三次，及至四日下午，更以巡洋艦及驅逐艦等十餘艘，出現於父島東方海而。</p>
<p>中部太平洋基地四日中央社電　迭尼安島日軍守備隊，於該地南都，對突人日軍最後抵抗綫之美軍，依然　續作極凄壯之邀擊戰，七月二十九日迄三十一日三日內，日軍給與敵人之損失，計敵遺屍二百五十具，負傷者八名，自敵登陸以來，總計敵死傷達五千九百五十名。</p>
<p>渝美空軍　活動力薄弱　日大軍圍攻衡陽中</p>
<p>湖南前綫四日中央社電　渝美空軍爲遏止日軍機隊之進擊，最近常日以百架之數來襲各地，企圖壓迫日軍防地，對此日軍地上部隊及運輸隊之奮鬥，亦極猛烈。此次作戰以來，地上部隊確實擊落渝美機六十餘架，湖南牙城之閉沛業已陷落，中原要塞之衡陽又在重圍之下，此外渝美空軍復受有極大咸脅。　為其華南基地十數處完全失掉。　為試行之反攻毫無成效，復引渝民非難，故美機顯已必須展開木格攻勢之企圖。六月下旬以來，其活動專以奇襲無掩護之日軍基地，集中主力轟炸日軍佔領之各都市道路水路，力避與機作空戰。渝美機之米襲多至黎明與黃昏，且多以轟炸機B或B25六架至十二架，利用B40型戰鬥機掩護，發見日軍船艇及車輛部隊時，即將炸彈全部投下而去。日軍之地上防空部隊，自六月下旬至七月十日，確實擊落其八架，未證實者三十餘架，平均一日擊落一架。又因日軍機隊連日之熾烈進攻，中國西南部之愉美空軍基地，亦瀕於潰減，其活動亦形衰美。</p>
<p>各綫戰事　均獲進展</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日軍在各方面之戰況如次：中國戰綫　陸戰日軍現仍繼續圍攻衡陽，並向各地圍攻增援衡陽，由第六第九兩戰區而來之渝軍戰車予以重創。（甲）湘江以東地區之日軍，在萍鄉南方地區方面，曾澈底擊潰渝軍第五十八第七十二兩軍，并進擊潰走之淪軍，入月一日佔領萍鄉南方於五十公里之要點連花，刻仍在繼續進擊中。及安仁南方地區方面日軍，利用機動部隊圍攻渝第三十七軍之主力及第二十四十四兩軍各一部，刻下展開擊滅作戰中。耒陽正面愉軍自七月二十八日其行動稍形活躍，茲日軍正對其蠢動企圖作有效之攻擊中。（乙）湘江以西地區，渝軍當局刻正分別派遺其第一百軍及第七十九六十二兩軍，由衡陽西方及西南方出動，急謀解開日軍對衡陽之包圍態勢，但經日軍在各處戲擊，已予重創。　空戰日機隊除協力陸上戰鬥外，並反復聶炸渝軍基地挂林。柳州。芷江等地，着着使集結中之美機潰減，結果來襲潮南戰域上空之美機，目下已見減少。此外駐渝美空軍前進基地，如粵漢綫以東之麗永遂川南雄等地，已因日空軍之壓制面潛伏，致此等基地，殆完全失其效能。由於日軍陸空一體主導攻勢之故，渝機由中國東南方基地空襲日本土，擾亂大東亞海運連路綫之企圖，今已完全粉碎。然駐渝美空軍仍藉渝印運輸路，積極補給飛機及各種軍需資材，愉方頃誇稱，每日可利用運輸機一百五十餘架從事遝輸，其運輸量月額約為萬八千餘噸。</p>
<p>日軍加强　壓迫衡陽　　里斯本四日中央社電　據路透社重慶特派員三日報吿衡陽戰况如次：重慶軍事當局雖每晚發表戰况，但三日深夜，尙無發表。據來自衡陽之最近消息，渝軍對目前戰况，迄無改善之象，日軍現更以大軍自漢口沿粵漢路南下，對衡陽壓迫，更行加强。渝援軍雖開始攻擊衡陽外側，但仍未突破日軍包圍，城內守備軍，目下僅持空中補給食糧武器彈藥之不足，依然未見好轉，死傷頗多，增援部隊即迅速到達，守備隊堅守城內舊市街，仍屬困難。</p>
<h3>日厚生省救濟　出征軍人家屬　苦訴生活困難者日减</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日政府爲使出征軍人無後顧之憂，安心減敵起見，前會在厚生省內設立軍事保護院，迄上月止，已滿六年，其間由於運營得宜，遺族（軍事保護院之保護對象）苦訴生活困難之情形，最近日漸減少，故日全國市街村之問事處頓呈冷靜，茲介紹該院對前綫將兵所最關心之家族生活，子弟育養扶助及歸還兵復職等問題所行之方策與現況如次：</p>
<p>家族生計　狀態召入伍中之下士官兵家族，經濟發生困難時，即按軍事扶助法規定，士給補助金，即六大都市一日補助九角，人口二十萬以上之都市，一人一日七角五分，十五萬以上者，一人一日七角，五萬以上者，六角五分，未滿五萬之都市，一人一日六角，市街村一人一日五角。此數雖似過少，此中自有原因，例如美國曾制定失業者救濟法，由政府保障失業者之最低生活費，但在個人主義極度發達之美國，一旦失業，雖為父母兄弟，若無相常理由時，絕不與之過問。然於日本則正得其反，於家族制度嚴緊之日本，則悉數予以愛護，同時更有居住地域鄰人之愛護，故未有無法營生之情形，是以彼等之生活實遠勝於敵美權利義務之生活，應召及公營者若為</p>
<p>薪俸生活　者，則作最低限制之援護，將其同額之六成支給其家族，此法各官廳，公司，銀行等均已實施。至農家雖係佃戶亦使其女人自耕自食，對出征農家，則於全國各縣爭先動員學生，賓行勤勞服務，因此稻米之收穫常較主人出征前尤先完畢。於茲最成爲問題者，即薪俸生活者，中小商工業者，與自由勞動者等之家族，然於全國到處成呈人才不足之今日，此等家族欲行工作時，則工廠，公司等均不勝歡迎，是以以女人之力獲取收人維持生活者，已非難事，苦訴扶助者與人才不足成正比例，漸已減少，</p>
<p>扶助戶口　件數，較全應召入營者數，顯已減少。刻為將兵所最關心者，即幼兒較多之家庭，不能遠離慈親，或妻弱多病之時等，然現於東京設有三十處授產塲，內附設託兒所，母親工作時，可將幼兒託交該所看護，下午工畢歸途，再行領向家中，此外，並於全國各地分設數百處，目下更計劃大批增設。病弱生活困難之家庭，乃最而要憐居保護之家庭，無依無靠之家族，由市街村後方奉公會職員或女子義務援護，施以巡廻調查後，亦全部予以援護，生活困難之家，如有病人時，入院者一日支給兩元五角，赴醫院診療者，</p>
<p>支給醫費　之數成，並於臨產時則入院者一日支給兩元五角，如住家中者一次支給五十元以內之扶助金。除以上外，尚有種種扶助，例如二百元以內之生活扶助，三十元以內罹災者臨時生活扶助，三十元以內之埋葬費用等，以上乃根據扶助而決定者，此外對私生子及未婚妻及出征前實際侍奉之伯父，伯母，姪，外甥及軍屬家族，亦由軍人援護會予以與政府同樣之扶助。</p>
<h3>敵機數架　襲南滿地區</h3>
<p>新京四日中央社電　敵P38型機數架四日下午一時五十分來襲南滿地區，並企圖侵入鞍山，卸溪湖及大連等地，但經當地日機隊及防空部隊邀擊後，即行遁去，是役南滿地區未受損害。</p>
<h3>泰國公布　北國境戰况</h3>
<p>盤谷四日中央社電　泰官傳局三日發表，泰國北國境（舊緬領香斯提特）戰況如次：薩哈拉特泰多姆之泰軍偵察隊，曾於七月十四日上午十時許，與配有機槍二挺之敵眾約一小隊交戰，約歷一小時，卒將其擊退，是役寨方毫無損失。</p>
<h3>田中參議官　兼陸大校長</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日前駐菲律資最高指揮官田中靜壹大將，自去年五月因病回國養疴後，茲已完全恢復健康，日陸軍省於四日發表，任談氏為軍事參議官兼陸軍大學校長。</p>
<h3>政院推進　農業增產工作　社福部設農村診療所</h3>
<p>南京四日中央社電　行政院農業增產策進委員會，為明瞭京幾附近增產工作推動實況，連日特派員往中農實驗所，大勝關棉麻採種試驗塲，七孀灣棉作訓練班，曉竹稻麥採種試驗所，模範改進區堯化門棉花原種塲，合作社，鄉區各協進會等地視察，一部份工作成績，尚屬良好。</p>
<p>南京四日中央社電　社會福利部農村福利局，在各地設立農村服務所，於所下設立農村診療所，每所雇中西醫師各一人，護士一人，實行免費給藥，巡迥診療。聞計劃中預定設立三十所，現已成立八所，京郊附近已成立燕子磯上新河兩所。聞全部經費共二百五十五萬元，悉由行政院農業策進委員會撥給，其造福鄉民，簡接貢獻於增產工作實大</p>
<h3>日翼政會推舉　小林任總裁</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日夏政會小組委員會，三日夜及四日下午舉行協議，推舉該會後任總裁，決定推舉海軍大將翼贊會中央協力會議議長小林躋造氏為第二屆總栽，並於四日正午假推舉委員會報吿該小組委員會經過及結果，當由全會一致予以承認。同時，並決定以該會委員為交涉委員，懇請小林氏就任，於是金光氏等六人，旋即訪問小林大將，懇請渠就任談會後任總裁。</p>
<h3>英東方艦隊　司令易人</h3>
<p>中央社訊頃據可靠方面消息，敵英木國聯合艦隊司令官古魯斯費萊，今調任東方艦隊司令長官，即指揮印度洋艦隊，惟英國對古之人事重視非常，特予大事宣傳，頃目前本市對古雖無確實情報，但古之為人，亦無非買空賣空者流，靜待日後事實證明。</p>
<h3>漢日領　丸山榮轉要職</h3>
<p>漢口四日中央社電　駐漢日本續領事館丸山領事，近以榮轉某要職，日內即首途履新。丸山氏特於昨（三）日上午十一時，向市府石市長辭行。</p>
<h3>日情報局　評德土絕交　痛斥英美卑劣行爲</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日本情報局第三部部長井口氏，四日上午接見中外記者團，對德土絕交事披瀝見解，痛斥英美壓迫中立國之卑劣行為，原文如次：英美以強壓手段，使土耳其放棄祟高光榮之中立政策，實堪痛恨。土國自大戰勃發以來，維持中立政策拒絕參戰，保持國家主權，迄今已近五年，此次德土絕交，土國上下已盡最大努力，世人明際英美壓迫土國偵象者，莫不予以深切同情。</p>
<p>犧牲他國　遂其私慾</p>
<p>盎格魯撒克遜國家爲保持自國權益，達成自國野心，將其他國家付儲犧牲，乃其獨具之政策。英美兩國每逢戰局不利或停滯時，必盡所有手段擴大戰塲，誘致他國參戰，土國在此種情形下，遂成英美兩國策動之目標，終與德國絕交。今後英美恐仍不以此為滿足，更將使土國赴　蹈火，英美對土國之領土主權並未予以保障，其利用土國在戰略上地位及其國力，乃英美之最大目的</p>
<p>勝利誰屬　不辯自明　　總之，德士絕交，德國早已料及，故已有萬全對策。此次絕交，於德國戰力並無甚大影響，今後必將按旣定作戰方針，向前邁進，東西兩大戰塲目下均屬決定階段，其最後勝利究屬人類正義，抑屬侵略者，不言自明。</p>

<p>日本各界　表示好感　　東京四日中央社電　關於泰國阿巴溫內閣之成立，各界甚表好感，按新外相西塞那氏，於大東亞戰前，曾任駐日大使，居留日木多年，對日寨關係之強化建樹甚多，海軍指導者國防相西恩等，均屬泰國政治家，畢本前　相時，建功立憲革命之泰國元老巴翁大將，亦參加內閣，擔任不管部大臣，舉國一致，結成堅強不拔之內閣，此次畢本內閣之　職，全屬內政問題，至日內閣之對外政策，仍毫無變更，在舉國一體下，根據日泰同盟條約及大東亞共同宣言，實行一貫不變之戰爭政策，共同擊滅英美。畢本前首相在議會中關於政府緊急勒令未獲了認，結果為尊重議會之意向，刷新民心起見，乃實行總辭職。然畢本元帥就任首相以來，盡力於革新國政，增強國力，勳績昭著。當大東亞戰爭開始時，允許日軍通過國境，同年十二月二十一日，締結日泰軍事同盟，日泰關係益形緊密化，寨國為防衛國土，避免英美之侵略及榨取，乃與日木合作，毅然參加大東亞解放戰爭，其協助之功績實大</p>
<p>宣傳部發　言人談話　　南京四日中央社電　關於寨國內閣改組事，國民政府宣傳部發言人，特發表談話如下：　寨國在大東亞之軍事上，政治上與經濟上，佔有極重要之地位，尤其於軍事地理上，為西南太平洋之一屏障。　泰國自畢本首相秉政以來，協力大東亞戰爭，參加大東亞民族解放運動，功績至偉。我國為大東亞之一環，對於畢本首相之功績，異常感佩，現在由阿巴溫少校繼任苜相，組織新閣，不獨能將其全國政治，軍事予以強化，並可使其人民加強團結，一致擁戴，發揮力量，以協力戰學，保陣西南太平洋，當司斷言。　泰國為大東亞主要一份子，得與日本緊密協力，不獨為日泰兩民族之福，亦為整個大東亞各民族之福，蓋日泰兩國軍事，外交緊密連繫，無形中建立西南太平洋一堅固楝樑，協助緬甸之復與，印度之獨立，同時對於我國擊減英。美之殘餘勢力，亦有莫大之助力。　泰國前首相畢木氏，經已奠定日寨關係之緊密基礎，現新目相阿巴溫少校更能發揮日泰之密切關係，以完遂天東亞戰爭爲職志，此爲我國上下對其前途深表期待。</p>
<h3>渝文化界要求　言論出版自由</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝方於本年五月十二日舉行五中全會時，曾就英美攻擊渝方之獨裁化一點，提出討論。為博其歡心起見，會後曾發表稱，渝方此後對於新聞通信及言論出版之檢閱制度，將加以緩和，並以此大事宜傳。渝方以戰時為藉口，其極端抑默輿論，早為國內所非難，尤以一般大學校教授並作家之輩，因此忍氣吞聲，生活為難，引起所謂「文化之危機」，釀成莫大之社會問題。茲據此間獲悉，確實情報，共黨所設之通訊社「新華社「，於最近無綫電播音中，曾就渝方緩和檢閱言論一點　，揭穿其內幕稱：此次舉行十二中全會時，代表重慶文化界之郭沫若·洪深·老舍·矛盾·曹禺·等七十八名，曾聯名指摘當局壓迫言論界之非，並向全國發出痛烈之通電，於十二中全會提出強硬之請願文。此事雖經渝方禁止發表，但衡陽之大剛報，成都之新中國報，及各大學校之特刋雜誌，曾一齊加以揭裁，並引起大反響與聲援云。該項通電中稱，七年以來，於言論出版學術研究戲劇等公演等之際，當局輒以「不合國情」，「不合抗戰要求」等理由而加以禁止抑壓，類如此種災厄不遑枚舉。當局之抑壓言論出版之自由，已達極點，此不僅可阻礙抗戰建國，且可阻礙一國文化之發展，故提出下列五條：　取消圖書雜誌，及戲劇公演審查制度。　雜詰於出版同時申請登記，於登記發行以前，亦可郵遞。又業已發行者不得無故取消其登記證，或停止其發行。　出版後不得不經法律手續而禁止其發行，各地軍政當局不得禁止出版及干涉演劇。　訓令地方當局，嚴守法令，以保障言論出版之自由。　過去經抑留之一切戲劇並著作，凡不違反抗戰建國及民族利害者，均返回其原稿，解除禁止命令。上項五條要求，卽係郭等所提出者，而共黨機關通信社之加以暴露者，當次國共兩黨妥協，交涉難以接近之秋，亦殊有興味也。</p>
<h3>美軍進抵倫納　德嚴陣以待　北法戰事擴至布列塔尼</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　德元首行營三日午夜發表：西歐戰綫蘇軍已進達倫納區（Rennes）。按倫納市爲列塔尼半島（Brittany）首府，鐵路縱橫，為交通要個。三日夜美軍突擊部隊意圖一路橫斷法國，而形成長大之第二戰綫，或於一定地點轉向東方直攻巴黎，刻德軍正嚴陣以待，當與以重創。現談大突破部隊之動向，已成侵攻作戰之進點</p>
<h3>土耳其　大赦政治犯　瑞士代管德權益</h3>
<p>土京四日中央社電　海通社訊：土國國民會議，昨日通過法案，大赦政治犯，包括被土國法庭判處危害國家安全罪之英美蘇僑民，狙擊德大使巴本被判徒刑之外僑，亦在被赦之列。</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：瑞士將照顧土境之德國權益。</p>
<p>安加拉四日中央社電　德國新開社訊：數日來安加拉及斯丹埠之商業已完全停頓，但民了多爭購食糧，並向銀行提款。</p>
<h3>德國注視　事態推移</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　海通社訊：德外交部發言人稱：邱吉爾在下議院之報吿，顯示英國已委棄東南歐與蘇聯矣。土國對德絕交後，殆將淪爲蘇聯之勢力範圍，土內閣總理薩拉卓格魯之演說，並未提及蘇聯，殊堪注意。狙擊德大使巴奔之蘇僑二人，土政府已予釋放，顯示蘇聯爲幕後牽綫著，蘇聯之終極目的，爲獲得軍事根據地。合衆社消息，提及土國或將同意以鞭撻尼爾海峽置於國際管理下，德官方避不發表德政府之意向僅密切注視土國局勢之發展而已。</p>
<h3>斯達林　接見波總理</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據英方莫斯科消息，斯達林昨接見波蘭流亡政府總理米柯拉齊克，歷時二小時半，在座者有波外長羅默及蘇外委長莫洛托夫。</p>
<h3>英國龐大戰費</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　據倫敦訊：英下院核准貸款一批，計十萬萬鎊，作戰時費用。</p>
<h3>十噸重飛彈　降落倫敦區</h3>
<p>瑞典京城四日中央社電　最近三日流星彈攻擊倫敦及南英格蘭，每日連續達十四小時之久，此為七週以來最長時間之攻擊。據瑞典報紙所載倫敦特電，最近流星彈多為最大型，重量有達十噸者，可見其慘烈之破壞力，市民恐怖情緒達於頂點，故疏散者仍有增無滅。</p>
<h3>華沙東北方　坦克車大戰　維斯都拉河套德軍反攻</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蘇軍對喀爾巴阡山東面所施壓力，其激烈至星期三仍未稍減。維斯都拉河與森河間之三角地帶，曾發生極猛烈之戰鬥，蘇軍在該處使用極強大之坦克車及機械部隊，曾前進數公里，但被德軍反攻擊退。華沙東南蘇軍，迭次企圖在維斯都拉河建立新橋頭堡，但因遭德軍反攻而未逞。華沙迤東及東北方之德裝甲部隊，力抗蘇軍之機械化部隊，但德軍在各處皆能保守其陣地。在奧格斯托夫森林南面邊沿與維爾柯維斯基斯地區之間，蘇軍壓力特別重大，蘇軍以生力之步槍七隊隊及坦克車兩隊作戰，曾於八公里闊之戰綫上稍獲進展。</p>
<h3>湖廣熟·天下足</h3>
<p>— 隱公</p>
<p>湘米產量佔全國第三位</p>
<p>湖南爲中國一大產米區，自昔即有「湖廣熟，天下足」之諺，湖南蓋產在全國地位之重要，蓋由來已久。米毅產量據民二十一年國府至計處統計，除不產米殼的綏遠廣西兩省，以及未調查的靑海地方以外，全國米產額，以潮南省佔第三位，僅次於廣東及四川兩省，產量總數佔全國總產額百分之十一強。茲列表如下：</p>
<p>湖南全省稻作面積，以過去統計之缺點，及調查困難，尚無精確數字可得。據前湖南經濟調登所張人價君估計結果，則潮南十足年稻作面積約為二八，七一六，○○○畝，每畝產二稻額平均為四·九入石，全省產殼約為一四○，九五五，一三○石。茲將張人價君估計之結果，分為各流域列表於次：</p>
<p>由上表觀之，湖南十足年產榖，約為一萬四千餘萬石。湖南人口三千萬，若以普通所謂「一升一口，一年七石二斗」計之，則潮南產穀，尚不足以自給，但事賞絕不如此，普通所謂「一升一口，一年七石六斗」者，係指食米之地而言，並非全省每人平均之消費額，湘省雖以產米著稱，有餘之縣固多，但亦有不足之縣。據二十四年調查所得，則穀米有餘縣份凡三十三縣，各縣輸出之穀，全年自八千石以至一百三十萬石，此三十三縣中，合計全年若可餘榖七，九入七，○○○石。榖米不足縣份凡三十一縣，所缺殼數，大部份先由雜糧補充，小部分則由鄰縣輸入殼米，以資接濟。前所述餘殼縣份，可餘榖七首餘萬石，約以二分之一，供鄰縣之不足，而以二分之一輸出外省，故從全省觀之，常年均有榖米出口者，蓋以此也。</p>
<h3>湘米外輸　三主要口</h3>
<p>湖南出口之米市，在昔有三，一為易俗河，一為靖港，一為濸江。易俗河屬湘潭，位於滑水與湘江會會之處。靖港屬長沙，位於澙水與湘江會合之處。濸江屬漢夀，位於滄水浪水沅水會合之處。往年易俗河最負盛名，當時銷路，遠達滬粵，近銷武漢，倉庫鱗次，米袋塞途，米業之盛，一時無比，次如靖港，亦負盛名，今湘米在滬，仍用靖港米之名者，由來在此，滄江原為濱湖榖米集散市塲。湘米市塲，以長沙，蘆林潭，城陵磯為量大，南華　安四縣次之，　陵，郴縣更次之。由長沙，蘆林潭（屬湘陰縣），城陵礣（屬岳陽縣）三處出口者，多運往滬漢諸埠，由南華澧安出口者，多運往湖北沙市宜昌按處。由醴陵出口者或北運潮北，或東運江西。由郴縣出口者則遝往粵挂兩省。據統計民二十一年至二十四年之出數量如次：　　綜上所述，無論湘省為如何數收之年，湘米出口絕不至漫無紀錄，尤以郴縣米市，民二十一年尙無米向省外銷售，二十二年出口二千餘石，二千四年則增至四倍。</p>
<p>長沙爲中國四大米市塲之一</p>
<p>長沙米榖業，民國以來，逐漸發達，現為中國四大米穀市塲之一，在湖南全省中亦佔第一位，其發展原因有如下諸理由：　金融與米榖業之關係。長沙為潮南省金融之中心地，米榖業發展由此助成。　交通與米榖之關係。長沙為湖南省水陸交通之中心地，運輸便利，故全省米殼交易集中於此。</p>
<p>湘米運滬爲恢復配給之源</p>
<p>現在盟邦日本軍隊，以擊滅駐渝美軍爲目標，發動湖南作戰，節節勝利，長沙早已佔領，衡陽亦在圍攻中，旦夕可下。就經濟意義言，長沙衡陽一綫之佔領，均係湘省餘米之區，對於湘米取給有極大俾助，盟邦當局復鑒於後方民食問題之重要，近正謀湘米輸出，藉以接濟。</p>
<p>上海以來源不斷，戶口米配給已停止兩月，米價暴滕，民生焦苦，現在盟邦當局亟以湘米運滬，不久即可恢復配給，是則湘省作戰之捷，不僅擊滅駐渝美軍，在大東亞戰爭上獲取制勝之利，抑且對於後方民生問題，獲得莫大裨助，殊值吾人之欣慰也。</p>

<h3>華中公司受惠電報　實施戰時特例　不急要電報今後概不收發</h3>
<p>本市華中電扡通信公司，負有戰時重大使命，欲求通信業務之圓滿運行，特於受理電報上重定戰時特例，以資限制。此項限制辦法，將自八月五日起實施，此後情形且將隨時局之緊張而愈益加強之。查戰時特例，其重點要在一方面對不急要之電報，加以限制，而另一方面則傾其全力，以疏通關於戰時重要通信。是以向之含有慶弔及慰問意義之電報，固不庸言，即其他如爲電報局認爲不急要之電報，今後並將概不予以受理。易言之，亦即僅對實　緊要之電報，方予受理。現除華中區相互往來電報外，暫將以加急及特別加急者爲限。此蓋由於最近電報之激增，該公司雖努力高潮，終以技術人才與通信器械兩俱不足之現象，迫使疏通無術，不得已而乃出此非常措置。再關於受理電報時間，亦將予以縮短至午後六時，逾時除特種電報外，僅收愛加急電報，再心在下午八時以後到達之電報，除特別緊張要者外，將不再於翌日開始辦公時間以前送達云。此外關於非常事態發生時之緊急措置，則將視今後情勢推移而有所變易，哪電報字數並發報件數之限制，以及只辦重要通信，而將其他之電報業務實施全面或局部停止等，殆均爲預料中可能發生之事。此因電報得勝上莫大之缺憾，但事爲增強通信戰力計，誠有待於一般得勝者之了解與贊助。再據悉電報應用罪證限制辦法，仍同以往前例云。</p>

<h3>鹽田大尉　談太平洋戰況　日軍凖備澈底打擊敵軍</h3>
<p>盟邦在滬陸海外三當局主持之聯合報道常會，　昨（四）日下午三時，　南京路外灘滙中飯店五樓舉行，會見本市中國新聞記者，艦隊報道部到有鹽田大尉，囑託王炳南劉震南等，大使館上海事務所到福間副領事等，即席由鹽田大尉就記者所提出之太平洋方面最近戰況，答覆甚詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>馬島敵軍損失重大</p>
<p>鹽田大尉言謂，馬利亞納羣島方面戰況，在迭尼安島之激戰熾烈，刻日軍已敵軍大打擊，敵美損害頗重。此外在大宮島方面，日軍已積極在北部集結，同時在該島之日籍僑民，全部果敢與日軍協力作戰，惟在該島附近，艦艇猶無活動，深信守備該島之總隊，目前頗爲勞苦，靜待發動攻擊來犯之敵軍，予以澈底的嚴厲的打擊。</p>
<p>軍政軍令劃分意義</p>
<p>鹽田大尉繼述關於日政府今次劃分軍政令意義，說明頗詳，並謂及川大將此次長軍令部長職，及川大將本爲海軍大臣，頃陸海雙方，在軍政軍令上之劃分，處此決戰時局中，嶄然刷新態勢。且有島田大將今後則以軍事參義官姿態參與軍機，島田大將歷年貢獻綦巨，今後當更有最大努力。氏爲人溫厚，統埋是職最爲適任，而及川大將　研究有方，一般人更特別信賴，氏在五六年前，任駐筆派遣軍司令官啊時，搜羅中國古書頗　，且對中國歷史研究頗有心得，而對中國文學之研究，大爲精湛。此次長職，實可謂適才適人，非但爲海軍之傑出人才，而國內一般人民，莫不深爲期望。</p>
<p>日軍士氣閃爲振奮</p>
<p>最後鹽田氏又謂日本國民對海軍之期待頗大，目前所預定之作戰計劃，已逐漸進展。末又述如今將校士兵士氣益爲振奮，莫不願一赴前線決戰，現正請命待發中。</p>

<h3>書畫業亦應納稅</h3>
<p>— 王志遠</p>
<p>現在無論何業，均負有納稅的責任，盡國民之義務，甚至銀行存欵及職員薪條等，也有納所得稅義務。惟有上海一派名流。自稱謂警　家金石家者，對於稅之一字，從未負起實任。該項執業每日收入數字甚是可觀，如果徽求有名的書賓家，動輒數萬元計，其他萬元也有，數千元也有。還有一層，彼等的潤例，及加　費成數，隨時可以增加數字，並不受任何限制。就海上一隅而論，書　業及刻業者，不下萬計，若照彼等每月所人，納區區之稅，眞是九牛一毛，對於國家又多一筆收入。至於徽求書書者當為富有，不惜重金，徽求有名之氏以悅耳目，或者，留至百十年後，待善價而沽，故對於微隶者，應納奢侈類之零賣稅，不謂多矣。今建議數項列后：</p>
<p>由關係方面領導名大扇莊成立書畫業及刻者公會，以便統一管轄之。</p>
<p>所有書者畫者及刻者，一律應向公會登記，然後由公會代為呈請領取</p>
<p>關於執照費每季徽收一次，營業稅照每月收入多寡完納之。</p>
<p>關於微求者必須經過各大扇莊經手，以免漏稅之患。</p>

<h3>痢疾預防方法</h3>
<p>時值夏季，天氣炎熱，人身抵抗力減少，偶一不愼，疾病隨之。邇來痢疾，已有發見，華聯廠藥醫學化驗所，特將痢疾病源，及預防方法，論述如次，以供市民參考。</p>
<p>痢疾分阿米巴（Amooba）痢疾，與細菌（Bacillang）痢疾二大類，前者係阿米巴原虫所致，後者方痢疾細菌所傳染，每年夏季，患者較他季為多，查其原因，當與瓜菓蒼蠅有關。</p>
<p>現為瓜菓季節，亦蒼蠅繁殖之時，馬路上瓜攤菓販，到處可見，蒼蠅　集，揮之不去。是故傳染疾病亦以此時，機會最多，雖可用化學方法，於食瓜之前，加以消毒，如浸於過錳酸鉀溶液內等是，然有時細菌過多，藥力不足殺菌，往往收効甚少。</p>
<p>痢疾細菌，既從。而傳染至胃，善經過胃酸，不能殺減，則入於腸管，於是繁殖不已，一面分泌無菌者百分之三十三，由是可知痢疾與瓜果蒼蠅。</p>
<p>預防方法：　少食瓜菓冷飲，以減少傳染機會。　廁所或廚房內，裝置紗窗，以防蒼蠅飛入。　蒼蠅叢集之處，常洒消毒水，如石炭酸永或萊蘇水</p>
<p>絕其滋生，價較議者，有石灰粉與漂白粉等。　痢疾或其他傳染病患者，應送隔離醫院，速為治療，平時進食之前，宜常洗手。以上幾點，務望市民努力合作，以杜防傳染病之發生。</p>
<h3>肺病診療所　優待貧病</h3>
<p>防癆協曾，與中華公教醫師會，合組第四肺病珍療所於岳陽路一九七號（奮祁齊路），開幕月餘，診務甚為發達。該所近鑒於肺病一症，我國患者最多，一羅斯症，若不循正當途徑，靜心治療，必至無法挽救。目今醫藥昂貴，貧困患者，何來偌大醫費，爰訂定優待辦法，凡染斯症者，得向本處申請，介紹前往診治。費用分：免費，牟費，普通，特別，四種，一視各人環境，酌量收取。號金：半費五元，普通十元，特別三十元。X光透視：半費二十五元，普通五十元，特別一百元。人工氣胸：半費五十元，普通一百元，特別二百元。藥費：半警照批發半價，普通照批發價，特別照批發價加二成。</p>
<h3>贈送撲瘧寗片</h3>
<p>慕爾化學製藥廠來函：「謹啓者，茲送上敝廠出品治　聖藥「撲　寗藥片」散裝一千五百片，敬請責處施送貧病。敝廠因電力限制，出品無多，區區之數，聊以寄意，尙有</p>

<h3>血與淚（九）　海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>佐久間上尉在　長應在的司令塔上，原山機關中尉在電動機旁，鈴木上等機關兵　在汽油機　旁，舵手在推進機旁，空氣手在壓　空氣罐前面，可以說，在最後的死期內也各自在崗位上，並朱擅辦職守。</p>
<p>只有兩個人關開了自己的崗位。是長谷川中尉和門田上士兩個人。但兩個人的屍言是在汽油管破壞的地方。兩個人脫離自己的崗位，是證明興強烈的汽油味相搏鬧，一直到一口氣尚存的時候總是以身體堵塞裂口。</p>
<p>吉川中校和中城大尉，替他們痛哭不止，這當然是應該的事。認為這批潛艇員的犧牲，實在這是重於泰山電「死法」。</p>
<p>「好！」</p>
<p>吉川中校這一個評語，固然簡單，但也足够感動人了。</p>
<p>跟隨着中校之後的，有母艦豐橋號的軍醫長和看護部員等人，遺入艇內，詳詳細細地檢視一番後，即用厚毛毯把屍包裹起來，放到豐橋號上。全體艦員痛哭着，而給十四個死屍穿上新的軍服。須臾間，豐橋艦情悄地駛入吳港時，司令長官特命一切椗汨艦艇，以登舷典禮來迎接這些犧牲者。</p>
<p>後來來對佐久間隊長的尊敬和，立刻增加了百借。這是因為在艇長的軍服當中發見了一本小冊十的原故。</p>
<p>最初發見者認為不過是用鉛筆隨意塗抹的小賬本，並未加以重視，但稍加細讀後，大家都吃</p>
<p>那是永垂不朽的遺囑。在那種環境裹，在那擔命運裹，竟能寫出這樣字句來，實在是具有空前未聞的意志和義務感。</p>
<p>與沉沒同時，電燈就熄滅了，在手電筒的微弱光綫下，佐久間上尉在汽油的惡劣氣味下喘息着寫完的。一直到意識尚淸楚的瞬間，毫無遺漏地寫着：沉沒的原因，沉沒後的一切經過，以及對於潛水艇的將來希望，上司對部屬的恩情，向前輩吿別等等的話語。</p>
<p>上尉的確够得上一位超人。當時上尉僅三十一家，夫人則於頭一年前故去，只留下兩歲的弱年女兒。（一二八）</p>

<h3>After the Restoration of Rationed Household Rice</h3>
<p>The city's household rice is about to be restored for rationing, which has been formally announced by the municipal authorities and the Shanghai office of the Allied embassies respectively. In yesterday's short commentary, we briefly discussed its significant meaning. We have always considered the rice and grain issue as the most important aspect of people's livelihoods. Therefore, we have repeatedly elaborated on it without fear of being tiresome in the past. Whenever we saw that the authorities' measures were inadequate, we would not hesitate to brave the cold and offer stern criticism. Our basic stance is to improve the people's livelihood. Therefore, we naturally cannot ignore the rice and grain issue, on which people's lives depend. Therefore, we still maintain this attitude and offer our humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Reviewing the rice and grain issue of the past year, simply put, it has gradually deteriorated in the midst of chaotic handling. On the one hand, some people took the opportunity to pursue exorbitant profits and did not hesitate to raise rice prices. As Mayor Chen said, "Nanjing and Shanghai are both metropolises, only six hours apart by train. I really don't understand why the rice price in Nanjing is around 3,000 yuan today, while it reaches 10,000 yuan in Shanghai. I think it's not just poor planning, but deliberate poor planning." That is to say, the high rice price in Shanghai is due to artificial reasons, that is, speculation by profiteers. However, the speculators' tricks can only succeed if there is an exploitable environment first. As the saying goes, things must rot from within before worms can grow. For example, the Rice Control Committee's implementation of the method of requisitioning all rice over five dou not long ago gave speculators the opportunity to raise prices, and then rice prices soared wildly. As for some people, they used their special power or convenience in their positions to collude with unscrupulous merchants to raise rice prices and profit from them. For example, the Gu Zhouhou and Hu cases that have been discovered, and cases similar to the Gu Zhou case that have not been discovered.</p>
<p>On the other hand, passive remedial methods were used in an attempt to level out rice prices, but their effectiveness was weak. For example, the municipal government of this city consulted the Rice Control Committee to change the policy to not requisitioning rice below ten dan. Public opinion called for abandoning requisitioning in order to ease the rice supply. Although it had a positive effect on the rice price decline, the forces of justice were never able to eliminate the speculative atmosphere. Handling a matter carefully and diligently, but with little benefit and many drawbacks, or harmful and useless, this is "poor planning," which, to a certain extent, is still excusable. Handling a matter with bad intentions and doing everything possible to do evil, the result will inevitably be unfavorable and harmful. This is "deliberately causing it to be hidden," which is unforgivable no matter what.</p>
<p>In the past year, the citizens of Shanghai have struggled to breathe under the pressure of rising rice prices. However, the citizens of Shanghai still endured life with the most arduous emotions. Why? Because Shanghai is an important rear base in the Greater East Asia War, and maintaining security is of utmost importance. Every citizen has this responsibility and this awareness. However, there is a limit to the extent to which citizens can endure a difficult life, which depends entirely on how well the authorities grasp it.</p>
<p>Now the Allied forces have won a great victory in Chaoshan. "When Hunan is ripe, the world is sufficient." Hunan's rice production ranks third in the country. Therefore, after this victory in the Xiang War and the occupation of rice-producing areas, a portion of rice and grain can be transported to remedy the food supply for the rear. At this time of the "green and yellow juncture" (the period between the exhaustion of the previous year's harvest and the ripening of the new crop), this remedy and restoration of rationing is the best time and has great significance economically and politically.</p>
<p>However, rationing must be maintained for a long period, which depends on a continuous source of supply. Therefore, restoring rationing is still a palliative measure. The fundamental solution, we believe, lies in how to统筹收买 (plan and purchase in a unified way) and set prices when the new grain comes on the market soon? How to study reasonable plans for the future based on past failures is the most urgent task today. If we want to completely and properly solve the food problem of the people, the relevant authorities should pay attention to it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Prime Minister's Regular Broadcast States His Determination to Complete the War; Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Reports on Diplomacy at the Cabinet Meeting Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese cabinet held a regular cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 am on the 4th. Prime Minister Koiso and all cabinet members attended. Regarding the matter of clarifying the government's determination to complete the war on the scheduled 8th, it was decided that Prime Minister Koiso would broadcast it via radio on the 8th. After that, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu reported on recent diplomatic issues. The meeting adjourned at 12:40 pm.</p>
<h3>Air Raids on Iwo Jima and Chichi Jima; Fierce Battles on Saipan, Enemy Forces Suffer Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - A report from a certain base in the Central Pacific states that enemy warplanes in powerful formations attacked Iwo Jima twice and Chichi Jima three times on the morning of the 4th. Furthermore, by the afternoon of the 4th, more than ten cruisers and destroyers appeared in the waters east of Chichi Jima.</p>
<p>Central Pacific Base, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese garrison on Saipan continued to wage extremely fierce battles against the American forces that had broken through to the last line of Japanese resistance in the southern capital of the island. In the three days from July 29th to 31st, the Japanese army inflicted the following losses on the enemy: 250 enemy corpses were left behind, and 8 were wounded. Since the enemy landed, the total number of enemy casualties has reached 5,950.</p>
<p>The Chongqing-US Air Force Has Weak Activity; The Japanese Army Encirclement of Hengyang is Underway</p>
<p>Hunan Front, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to curb the attacks of the Japanese air force, the Chongqing-US Air Force has recently attacked various places with hundreds of planes every day, attempting to suppress the Japanese defense zone. The Japanese ground forces and transport teams have also fought fiercely in response. Since the start of this operation, the ground forces have indeed shot down more than 60 Chongqing-US aircraft. The gate city of Hunan has already fallen, and Hengyang, the key fortress of the Central Plains, is again under heavy siege. In addition, the Chongqing-US Air Force has suffered extremely large threats, as more than a dozen of its South China bases have been completely lost. The attempted counterattack has been completely ineffective, and has also drawn criticism from the people of Chongqing. Therefore, the US planes have obviously had to launch a Mokugeki (literally "wooden eye") offensive. Since late June, their activities have been focused on surprise attacks on undefended Japanese bases, concentrating their main force to bomb Japanese-occupied cities, roads, and waterways, avoiding air combat with enemy planes. The Chongqing-US planes often attack at dawn and dusk, and mostly use six to twelve B- or B-25 bombers, using B-40 fighters for cover. When Japanese boats and vehicle units are discovered, all bombs are dropped and they leave. From late June to July 10, the Japanese ground air defense forces confirmed the shooting down of eight aircraft, and more than thirty unconfirmed aircraft, averaging one aircraft shot down per day. In addition, due to the fierce attacks of the Japanese air force in the past few days, the US Air Force bases in southwestern China are also on the verge of collapse, and their activities have also weakened.</p>
<p>Advances Achieved on All Fronts</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The war situation of the Japanese army in various aspects is as follows: China Front: The land-based Japanese army is still continuing to besiege Hengyang, and is besieging the reinforcements to Hengyang everywhere, heavily damaging the Chongqing army tanks coming from the Sixth and Ninth War Zones. (A) The Japanese army in the area east of the Xiang River completely defeated the Chongqing army's 58th and 72nd armies in the southern area of Pingxiang, and attacked and defeated the defeated Chongqing army, occupying Lianhua, a key point 50 kilometers south of Pingxiang on the 1st of the month, and is still continuing to attack. In the southern area of Anren, the Japanese army is using mobile units to besiege the main force of the Chongqing 37th Army and parts of the 24th and 44th Armies, and is currently launching an annihilation operation. The Chongqing army on the front of Laiyang has shown some active movements since July 28. The Japanese army is currently launching effective attacks on its attempts to move. (B) In the area west of the Xiang River, the Chongqing military authorities are currently dispatching their 100th Army and 79th and 62nd Armies separately, departing from the west and southwest of Hengyang, urgently seeking to break the Japanese army's siege of Hengyang. However, after being attacked by the Japanese army in various places, they have been heavily damaged. Air War: The Japanese air force, in addition to assisting land battles, has repeatedly bombed Chongqing military bases in Guilin, Liuzhou, Zhijiang, etc., causing the US planes that are gathering there to collapse. As a result, the number of US planes attacking the Chaozhou-Shantou battlefield has decreased. In addition, the forward bases of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, such as Liyong, Suichuan, Nanxiong, etc. east of the Yuehan Line, have been lying dormant due to the suppression of the Japanese air force, so these bases have almost completely lost their effectiveness. Due to the integrated offensive led by the Japanese army on land and in the air, the attempt by the Chongqing planes to attack the Japanese mainland from bases in southeastern China and disrupt the maritime transportation routes of the Greater East Asia has now been completely crushed. However, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing is still actively supplying aircraft and various military supplies through the Chongqing-India transportation route. The Chongqing side recently boasted that it can use more than 150 transport aircraft every day for transportation, and its monthly transportation volume is about 18,000 tons.</p>

<p>According to a report from Reuters' Chongqing correspondent on the 3rd, the war situation in Hengyang is as follows: Although the Chongqing military authorities issue reports on the war situation every night, there has been no report issued late on the 3rd. According to the latest news from Hengyang, the Chongqing army has not improved the current war situation. The Japanese army is now sending more troops south along the Yuehan Road from Hankou, further increasing the pressure on Hengyang. Although the Chongqing reinforcements have begun to attack the outside of Hengyang, they have not yet broken through the Japanese encirclement. The food, weapons, and ammunition supplied by air to the defenders in the city are still insufficient, and there has been no improvement. There are still many casualties. Even if the reinforcements arrive quickly, it will still be difficult for the defenders to hold the old city streets.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare Provides Relief to Families of Soldiers on Expeditions; Complaints of Difficult Living Conditions are Decreasing Daily</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to ensure that soldiers on expeditions have no worries about the future and can concentrate on reducing the enemy, the Japanese government previously established a Military Protection Institute within the Ministry of Health and Welfare. As of last month, it has been six years since its establishment. During this period, due to proper operation, the situation of families (the protected objects of the Military Protection Institute) complaining about difficult living conditions has recently decreased day by day. Therefore, the inquiry offices in cities, towns, and villages across the country have become quieter. Now, we will introduce the institute's policies and current situation regarding issues that are of most concern to soldiers on the front lines, such as family life, childcare and support, and re-employment of returning soldiers:</p>
<p>Family Livelihood Status: When the families of non-commissioned officers and soldiers who are called into service encounter economic difficulties, subsidies are given according to the provisions of the Military Assistance Law, that is, 90 cents per person per day in the six major cities, 75 cents per person per day in cities with a population of more than 200,000, 70 cents per person per day in cities with more than 150,000, 65 cents per person per day in cities with more than 50,000, 60 cents per person per day in cities with less than 50,000, and 50 cents per person per day in towns and villages. Although this number seems too small, there is a reason for this. For example, the United States has formulated an unemployment relief law, where the government guarantees the minimum living expenses of the unemployed. However, in the United States, where individualism is extremely developed, once unemployed, even parents and siblings will not care about it unless there is a proper reason. However, in Japan, it is the opposite. In Japan, where the family system is strict, they are all loved and cared for. At the same time, there is also love and care from the residents of the residential area. Therefore, there is no situation where they cannot make a living. Therefore, their lives are far better than the lives of enemy Americans with rights and obligations. Those who are called into service and public employees who live on salaries are given the minimum amount of assistance, and 60% of their salary is paid to their families. This method has been implemented in various government offices, companies, banks, etc. As for farmers, even if they are tenants, their women are allowed to cultivate and feed themselves. For farmers on expeditions, students are mobilized to provide labor services in all counties across the country, so the rice harvest is often completed even earlier than before the owner went on an expedition. The most problematic families are those of salaried workers, small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, and freelance workers. However, in today's Japan, where there is a shortage of talent everywhere, when these families want to work, factories, companies, etc. are very welcoming. Therefore, it is not difficult for women to earn income and maintain their lives. Complaints about assistance and lack of talent are directly proportional and have gradually decreased.</p>
<p>The number of assisted households has clearly decreased compared to the total number of those called into service. What soldiers are most concerned about now are families with more young children who cannot leave their mothers, or wives who are weak and sick. Currently, there are 30 production sites with attached nurseries in Tokyo. When mothers work, they can entrust their young children to the nursery for care. After work in the afternoon, they can pick them up and take them home. In addition, hundreds of locations have been established throughout the country, and there are plans to greatly increase the number. Families with sick, weak, and difficult lives are the most in need of care and protection. Helpless families are investigated by officials from the city and village Houfang Bongong Hui (Rear Service Association) or female volunteer assistants, and all are assisted. If there are patients in families with difficult lives, those who are hospitalized are given two yuan and fifty cents per day. Those who go to the hospital for treatment are given the full amount of medical expenses. For childbirth, those who are hospitalized are given two yuan and fifty cents per day, and those who live at home are given an assistance payment of up to fifty yuan. In addition to the above, there are various other forms of assistance, such as life assistance of up to two hundred yuan, temporary life assistance for disaster victims of up to thirty yuan, and burial expenses of up to thirty yuan. The above is determined based on assistance. In addition, the Military Support Association also provides the same assistance as the government to illegitimate children, fiancées, and uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and families of military personnel who actually served before the expedition.</p>

<h3>Councilor Tanaka Concurrently Serves as Principal of the Army University</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant General Tanaka Seichi, the former Supreme Commander of the Philippines, has fully recovered his health after returning to Japan for recuperation due to illness in May last year. The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 4th that Tanaka would be appointed as a military councilor and concurrently serve as the principal of the Army University.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Promotes Agricultural Production Increase; The Ministry of Social Welfare Establishes Rural Clinics</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Agricultural Production Increase Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, in order to understand the actual situation of promoting production increase in the vicinity of Beijing and Ji (Hebei), has specially dispatched members to the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, Dashengguan Cotton and Hemp Seed Breeding Experiment Farm, Qishuangwan Cotton Training Class, Xiaozhu Rice and Wheat Seed Breeding Experiment Station, Yaohuamen Cotton Seed Farm in the Model Improvement Area, cooperatives, and township-level progressive associations for inspection. The results of some of the work are still good.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Rural Welfare Bureau of the Ministry of Social Welfare has established rural service stations in various places, and rural clinics have been established under the stations. Each station employs one Chinese and one Western doctor, and one nurse, to provide free medicine and mobile medical services. It is heard that the plan is to establish 30 stations, and eight have already been established. The Yanziji and Shangxinhe stations have been established in the vicinity of the capital. It is heard that the total cost is 2,550,000 yuan, all of which is allocated by the Agricultural Production Promotion Committee of the Executive Yuan, which greatly benefits the villagers and indirectly contributes to increasing production.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Elects Kobayashi as President</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The subcommittee of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association held discussions on the evening of the 3rd and the afternoon of the 4th, and nominated the successor president of the association. It was decided to nominate Admiral Kobayashi Seizo, chairman of the central cooperation conference of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, as the second president. The subcommittee reported the process and results to the nomination committee at noon on the 4th, and it was unanimously approved by the entire committee. At the same time, it was also decided that the members of the association would be the negotiating committee, and they would earnestly request Kobayashi to take office. Thereupon, Kinugasa and five others immediately visited Admiral Kobayashi and earnestly requested him to take office as the successor president of the association.</p>
<h3>The Commander of the British Eastern Fleet Changes</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources from the Central News Agency, Commander-in-Chief Creasy, commander of the enemy's British and American combined fleet, has been transferred to commander of the Eastern Fleet, which is to command the Indian Ocean Fleet. However, Britain attaches great importance to Creasy's personnel, and has given it a great deal of publicity. Although there is no reliable information about Creasy in this city at present, Creasy is nothing more than a speculator. We will wait for the facts to prove it in the future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul in Hankou, Maruyama Sakae, Transfers to an Important Position</h3>
<p>Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - Consul Maruyama of the Japanese Consulate in Hankou will soon be taking up a new post in an important position. Mr. Maruyama said goodbye to Mayor Shi of the municipal government at 11:00 am yesterday (3rd).</p>
<h3>The Japanese Information Bureau Comments on the Severance of Relations Between Germany and Turkey, and Vigorously Criticizes the Base Behavior of Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Iguchi, director of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, met with Chinese and foreign reporters on the morning of the 4th to express his views on the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, and vigorously criticized the base behavior of Britain and the United States in oppressing neutral countries. The original text is as follows: It is hateful that Britain and the United States used strong-arm tactics to force Turkey to abandon its noble and glorious policy of neutrality. Since the outbreak of the Great War, Turkey has maintained a policy of neutrality, refusing to participate in the war and maintaining national sovereignty for nearly five years. This time, Turkey's severance of relations with Germany was the result of Turkey's best efforts. Those who understand the signs of British and American oppression of Turkey deeply sympathize with it.</p>
<p>Sacrificing Other Countries to Achieve Their Selfish Desires</p>
<p>Sacrificing other countries to maintain their own rights and interests and achieve their own ambitions is a unique policy of Anglo-Saxon countries. Whenever the war situation is unfavorable or stagnant, Britain and the United States will use all means to expand the battlefield and induce other countries to participate in the war. Under such circumstances, Turkey became the target of British and American machinations and finally severed relations with Germany. In the future, Britain and the United States may not be satisfied with this and will make Turkey go through fire and water. Britain and the United States have not guaranteed Turkey's territorial sovereignty. Their greatest purpose is to use Turkey's strategic position and national strength.</p>
<p>The Outcome of Victory is Self-Evident</p>
<p>In short, Germany has long anticipated the severance of relations between Germany and Turkey, and has therefore taken all necessary countermeasures. This severance of relations will not have a significant impact on Germany's war capabilities. In the future, it will move forward according to the established war policy. Both the East and West war zones are currently in decisive stages. It is self-evident whether the final victory will belong to human justice or to the aggressors.</p>

<h3>Abiding by Signed Treaties and Enhancing Friendship Between Japan and Thailand; The New Cabinet of Thailand Announces Six Political Programs</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Thai Parliament held an extraordinary session at 2:00 pm on the 3rd. Prime Minister Apaiwong announced the six political programs of the new cabinet. After being trusted and agreed upon by the Parliament, the Apaiwong Cabinet was officially established. The six political programs of the new cabinet are recorded as follows: This government is the government of the King of Thailand according to the Thai constitution. This government has abided by the following six principles advocated by the people's vote during the revolution: A. The principle of freedom and independence; B. The establishment of a permanent peaceful order; C. Economic freedom; D. Equality of rights; E. Freedom of the people; F. The education of the people. This government must be faithful to the King, the Constitution, and the people. It must strive to avoid policies that violate the interests of the people and make it easy for the people to suffer difficulties, and it must respect the advice of the Parliament. This government has full sympathy and understanding for the people and handles national affairs. This government will maintain the stability of the national finances and strive to reduce unnecessary expenses. This government will abide by the treaties signed with Japan, not only maintain the past friendly relations between the two countries, but also strive to further strengthen them. For other countries, it will implement the same policies in accordance with the treaties or agreements that this country has issued and fixed.</p>
<p>Various Circles in Japan Express Goodwill</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Various circles have expressed great goodwill regarding the establishment of the Apaiwong Cabinet in Thailand. According to the new Foreign Minister Xisenna, before the Greater East Asia War, he served as the ambassador to Japan and resided in Japan for many years, making many contributions to strengthening the relationship between Japan and Thailand. Naval leader and Defense Minister Xien, etc., are all Thai politicians. General Pawong, a veteran of Thailand's founding and constitutional revolution, who contributed to the establishment when Phibun was Prime Minister, also participated in the cabinet, serving as Minister without Portfolio. The whole country is united, forming a strong and unyielding cabinet. The resignation of the Phibun Cabinet this time is entirely a matter of internal affairs. As for the foreign policy of the Japanese Cabinet, it remains unchanged. Under the unity of the whole country, based on the Japan-Thailand Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, it will implement a consistent war policy to jointly defeat Britain and the United States. Former Prime Minister Phibun devoted himself to reforming national affairs and strengthening national power since taking office as Prime Minister. His achievements are well-known. When the Greater East Asia War began, he allowed the Japanese army to pass through the national border, and on December 21 of the same year, he concluded the Japan-Thailand military alliance, and the relationship between Japan and Thailand became closer. In order to defend its territory and avoid the invasion and exploitation of Britain and the United States, Thailand cooperated with Japan and resolutely participated in the Greater East Asia War of Liberation. Its contribution is great.</p>
<p>Spokesman of the Propaganda Department Speaks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the reorganization of the cabinet in Thailand, the spokesman of the Propaganda Department of the National Government made the following statement: Thailand occupies an extremely important position in the Greater East Asia in terms of military, politics, and economy, especially in terms of military geography, it is a barrier to the Southwest Pacific. Since Prime Minister Phibun took power in Thailand, he has cooperated in the Greater East Asia War and participated in the Greater East Asia National Liberation Movement. His achievements are great. As a part of the Greater East Asia, our country admires Prime Minister Phibun's achievements very much. Now that Major Apaiwong has succeeded as the chief minister and organized a new cabinet, it can not only strengthen the national politics and military, but also strengthen the unity of its people, unanimously support it, and exert its strength to cooperate in the war and protect the Southwest Pacific. This is what we can断言 (assert). As a major member of the Greater East Asia, Thailand can closely cooperate with Japan, which is not only a blessing for the two nations of Japan and Thailand, but also a blessing for all the nations of the entire Greater East Asia. The close military and diplomatic ties between Japan and Thailand have invisibly established a solid pillar in the Southwest Pacific, assisting in the recovery of Myanmar and the independence of India. At the same time, it will also be of great help to our country in reducing the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. Former Prime Minister Phibun has already laid a solid foundation for the close relationship between Japan and Thailand. Now, the new chief minister, Major Apaiwong, will be able to better promote the close relationship between Japan and Thailand in order to accomplish the Greater East Asia War. This is what our country expects from its future.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Cultural Circles Demand Freedom of Speech and Publication</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: During the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang held in Chongqing on May 12th this year, the issue of criticism from Britain and the United States regarding Chongqing's drift towards autocracy was discussed. In an attempt to appease them, it was announced after the meeting that Chongqing would ease its censorship of news, communication, speech, and publication, and this was widely publicized. Chongqing's extreme suppression of public opinion under the pretext of wartime conditions had long been criticized domestically, especially by university professors and writers, who had to swallow their anger and endure difficult lives, leading to a so-called "cultural crisis" and a major social problem. According to reliable sources here, the Communist Party's news agency, "Xinhua News Agency," recently revealed the inside story of Chongqing's easing of censorship in a radio broadcast, stating that during the Twelfth Plenary Session, 78 representatives of Chongqing's cultural circles, including Guo Moruo, Hong Shen, Lao She, Mao Dun, Cao Yu, and others, jointly criticized the authorities' suppression of freedom of speech and issued a strongly worded telegram to the entire nation, presenting a firm petition to the Twelfth Plenary Session. Although Chongqing banned the publication of this matter, the Dagang Daily in Hengyang, the New China Daily in Chengdu, and special publications of various universities all exposed it, causing widespread repercussions and support. The telegram stated that for the past seven years, whenever there were speeches, publications, academic research, or theatrical performances, the authorities would prohibit or suppress them under the pretext of "not conforming to national conditions" or "not meeting the requirements of the war," and such disasters were too numerous to count. The authorities' suppression of freedom of speech and publication had reached its extreme, which not only hindered the war effort and national reconstruction but also hindered the development of the nation's culture. Therefore, the following five points were proposed: 1. Abolish the censorship system for books, magazines, and theatrical performances. 2. Magazines can apply for registration at the time of publication and can also be mailed before registration and distribution. Furthermore, registration certificates should not be revoked or distribution suspended without cause. 3. Publication should not be prohibited after publication without legal procedures, and local military and political authorities should not prohibit publication or interfere with theatrical performances. 4. Instruct local authorities to strictly abide by laws and regulations to protect freedom of speech and publication. 5. All plays and writings that have been suppressed in the past, which do not violate the war effort, national reconstruction, or national interests, should have their original manuscripts returned and the prohibition orders lifted. The above five demands were proposed by Guo and others, and the Communist Party's news agency's exposure of them is particularly interesting in light of the current difficult negotiations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<h3>American Troops Reach Rennes; Germans Prepare for Battle; Fighting in Northern France Extends to Brittany</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 4th: The German Supreme Headquarters announced at midnight on the 3rd that the Allied forces on the Western European front had reached the Rennes area. Rennes is the capital of the Brittany Peninsula, with railways crisscrossing it, making it a crucial transportation hub. On the night of the 3rd, American assault troops attempted to cut across France, forming a large second front, or to turn east at a certain point and directly attack Paris. German troops are now preparing for battle and will inflict heavy losses on them. The movement of the breakthrough troops has now become the starting point for offensive operations.</p>
<h3>Turkey Grants Amnesty to Political Prisoners; Switzerland to Manage German Interests</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th: Reuters reports that the Turkish National Assembly yesterday passed a law granting amnesty to political prisoners, including British, American, and Soviet expatriates convicted by Turkish courts of endangering national security. Foreigners sentenced for the assassination attempt on German Ambassador von Papen are also included in the amnesty.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The German News Agency reports that Switzerland will take care of German interests in Turkey.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Ankara, 4th: The German New Agency reports that commerce in Ankara and Istanbul has come to a complete standstill in recent days, but the public is rushing to buy food and withdraw money from banks.</p>
<h3>Germany Watches Developments Closely</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: Reuters reports that a German Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Churchill's report in the House of Commons showed that Britain had abandoned Southeastern Europe to the Soviet Union. After Turkey's break with Germany, it is likely to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. Turkish Prime Minister Saraçoğlu's speech did not mention the Soviet Union, which is noteworthy. The Turkish government has released the two Soviet expatriates who attempted to assassinate German Ambassador von Papen, indicating Soviet behind-the-scenes maneuvering. The ultimate goal of the Soviet Union is to obtain military bases. United Press International reported that Turkey may agree to place the Dardanelles Strait under international administration. German officials have avoided expressing the German government's intentions and are only closely monitoring the developments in Turkey.</p>
<h3>Stalin Meets with Polish Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 4th: The German News Agency reports that, according to British sources in Moscow, Stalin met with Polish Prime Minister Mikołajczyk of the government-in-exile yesterday for two and a half hours. Polish Foreign Minister Romer and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were also present.</p>
<h3>Huge British War Expenditure</h3>

<h3>Ten-Ton Missiles Fall on London</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 4th: For the past three days, flying bombs have attacked London and Southern England continuously for up to fourteen hours each day, the longest sustained attack in seven weeks. According to a special dispatch from London in a Swedish newspaper, the recent flying bombs have been the largest, weighing up to ten tons, demonstrating their devastating destructive power. Public panic has reached its peak, and the number of evacuees continues to increase.</p>
<h3>Major Tank Battles Northeast of Warsaw; German Counterattacks in the Vistula River Pocket</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 4th: The German News Agency reports that Soviet pressure on the eastern side of the Carpathian Mountains continued unabated on Wednesday. Extremely fierce fighting took place in the triangle between the Vistula and San Rivers. The Soviets used very powerful tanks and mechanized units in that area, advancing several kilometers but being driven back by German counterattacks. Southeast of Warsaw, Soviet troops repeatedly attempted to establish new bridgeheads on the Vistula River, but failed due to German counterattacks. East and northeast of Warsaw, German armored units resisted Soviet mechanized units, but German troops were able to hold their positions everywhere. Soviet pressure was particularly heavy along the southern edge of the Augustów Forest and in the Vilkoviskis area. The Soviets fought with fresh rifle divisions and tank divisions, making some progress on an eight-kilometer-wide front.</p>
<h3>Abundant Harvest in Hunan and Hubei Provinces Leads to National Sufficiency</h3>
<p>— Yin Gong</p>
<p>Hunan's Rice Production Ranks Third Nationally</p>
<p>Hunan is a major rice-producing region in China. There is an old saying, "Abundant harvests in Hunan and Hubei provinces lead to national sufficiency." The importance of Hunan's rice production in the country has been long-standing. According to statistics from the National Government's Statistics Bureau in 1932, excluding the provinces of Suiyuan and Guangxi, which do not produce rice, and the Qinghai region, which was not surveyed, Hunan province ranked third in the country in terms of rice production, second only to Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, accounting for a total of approximately 11% of the country's total production. The following is a table of statistics:</p>
<p>Due to past statistical shortcomings and survey difficulties, there are no precise figures for the total rice cultivation area in Hunan province. According to the estimates of Mr. Zhang Renjia of the former Hunan Economic Investigation Institute, the total rice cultivation area in Hunan is approximately 28,716,000 mu, with an average yield of 4.9 shi per mu, resulting in a total rice production of approximately 140,955,130 shi. The following is a table showing Mr. Zhang Renjia's estimates, broken down by river basin:</p>
<p>From the table above, we can see that Hunan's total annual grain production is approximately 140 million shi. Hunan has a population of 30 million. If we use the common saying, "One sheng per person, seven shi and two dou per year," then Hunan's grain production is not sufficient to feed itself. However, the reality is not so simple. The common saying, "One sheng per person, seven shi and two dou per year," refers to rice-consuming areas and does not represent the average consumption per person in the entire province. Although Hunan is known for its rice production, there are many counties with surpluses, but also counties with deficits. According to a survey conducted in 1935, there were 33 counties with a surplus of grain and rice, with each county exporting from 8,000 shi to 1,300,000 shi annually. These 33 counties had a total surplus of 797,000 shi of grain. There were 31 counties with a deficit of grain and rice. The majority of the deficit was supplemented by coarse grains, and a small portion was imported from neighboring counties for assistance. The aforementioned surplus counties could surplus 700,000 shi of grain, with approximately half used to supply the deficits of neighboring counties and the other half exported to other provinces. Therefore, from the perspective of the entire province, grain and rice are usually exported annually.</p>
<h3>Three Major Ports for Hunan Rice Exports</h3>
<p>In the past, there were three major ports for exporting Hunan rice: Yisuhe, Jinggang, and Cangjiang. Yisuhe is located in Xiangtan, at the confluence of the Lishui and Xiangjiang rivers. Jinggang is located in Changsha, at the confluence of the Liushui and Xiangjiang rivers. Cangjiang is located in Hanshou, at the confluence of the Cangshui, Langshui, and Yuanshui rivers. In the past, Yisuhe was the most famous, with its sales reaching as far as Shanghai and Guangzhou, and as close as Wuhan. Warehouses were lined up, and rice sacks blocked the roads. The prosperity of the rice industry was unparalleled. Jinggang was also well-known. The name "Jinggang rice" is still used for Hunan rice in Shanghai today. Cangjiang was originally a distribution market for grain and rice near the lake. The rice markets in Changsha, Lulin Pond, and Chenglingji have the largest volume, followed by Nanhua and Li'an, and then Liling and Chen County. Rice exported from Changsha, Lulin Pond (in Xiangyin County), and Chenglingji (in Yueyang County) is mostly shipped to ports in Shanghai and Wuhan. Rice exported from Nanhua and Li'an is mostly shipped to Shashi and Yichang in Hubei. Rice exported from Liling is either shipped north to Hubei or east to Jiangxi. Rice exported from Chen County is shipped to Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. The following are the export volumes from 1932 to 1935: In conclusion, regardless of how bad the harvest year is in Hunan province, there will always be some record of Hunan rice exports. In particular, the rice market in Chen County did not sell any rice outside the province in 1932, exported over 2,000 shi in 1933, and increased to four times that amount in 1935.</p>
<p>Changsha is One of China's Four Major Rice Markets</p>
<p>Changsha's rice and grain industry has gradually developed since the founding of the Republic of China and is now one of China's four major rice and grain markets, ranking first in Hunan province. The reasons for its development are as follows: The relationship between finance and the rice and grain industry. Changsha is the financial center of Hunan province, which has contributed to the development of the rice and grain industry. The relationship between transportation and rice and grain. Changsha is the transportation hub of Hunan province, with convenient transportation, so rice and grain transactions throughout the province are concentrated here.</p>
<p>Hunan Rice Shipped to Shanghai as a Source for Restoring Rationing</p>
<p>Currently, the Allied Japanese forces, with the goal of destroying the American troops stationed in Chongqing, have launched an operation in Hunan, achieving victory after victory. Changsha has already been occupied, and Hengyang is under siege and will fall soon. From an economic perspective, the occupation of the Changsha-Hengyang line is a major source of surplus rice in Hunan, which will greatly assist in the supply of Hunan rice. The Allied authorities, aware of the importance of the food problem in the rear, are currently planning to export Hunan rice to provide relief.</p>
<p>Shanghai stopped rationing household rice for two months because supplies were interrupted, leading to soaring rice prices and hardship for the people. The Allied authorities are now urgently shipping Hunan rice to Shanghai, and rationing will soon be restored. Therefore, the victories in the Hunan operation not only destroyed the American troops stationed in Chongqing and secured a winning advantage in the Greater East Asia War but also greatly contributed to the food problem in the rear, which is worthy of our satisfaction.</p>

<h3>Huazhong Telegraph Company Implements Wartime Special Measures; Non-Urgent Telegrams No Longer Accepted</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Telegraph and Communication Company in this city bears a major wartime mission. In order to ensure the smooth operation of communication services, it has specifically set wartime special measures for handling telegrams to impose restrictions. These restrictions will be implemented from August 5th. Thereafter, the situation will be further strengthened with the increasing tension of the situation. The focus of the wartime special measures is to restrict non-urgent telegrams on the one hand, and to devote its full efforts to facilitate important wartime communications on the other hand. Therefore, telegrams containing condolences and greetings are of course out of the question, and other telegrams deemed non-urgent by the telegraph office will no longer be accepted in the future. In other words, only telegrams that are truly urgent will be accepted. Currently, in addition to telegrams exchanged within the Huazhong region, only those marked as express and special express will be accepted for the time being. This is because of the recent surge in telegrams, which, despite the company's best efforts, has been impossible to handle due to insufficient technical personnel and communication equipment. As a result, this extraordinary measure has been taken out of necessity. Furthermore, the time for accepting telegrams will be shortened to 6:00 PM. After that time, only express telegrams will be accepted, except for special telegrams. Telegrams arriving after 8:00 PM will no longer be delivered before the start of business hours the next day, except for those that are particularly urgent. In addition, emergency measures in the event of an extraordinary situation will be subject to change depending on the future development of the situation. Restrictions on the number of words in telegrams and the number of telegrams sent, as well as the implementation of a complete or partial suspension of other telegram services, leaving only important communications, are all expected to occur. This is a major drawback in winning the telegram war, but in order to enhance communication combat power, it is sincerely necessary to have the understanding and support of the general winners. It is also learned that the restrictions on the use of telegrams as evidence will remain the same as in the past.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's News Association Hosts Banquet for Minister Lin Xuan</h3>
<p>Minister Addresses and Encourages the Press</p>
<p>The Shanghai News Association, in honor of Minister Lin Xuan's visit to Shanghai on official business, held a banquet in his honor last night at the Industry and Commerce Association. In addition to Minister Lin, the attendees included Vice Minister Wei Ke, Director Guo Xiufeng and Deputy Director Hu Luzhou of the Central Telegraph Agency, Director Wu Linzhi of the Newspaper Management Office, Director Liang Xiuyu of the Shanghai Municipal Propaganda Office, Director Liu Shike of the News Inspection Office, and Director Chu Baoheng of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency. On the Allied side, the attendees included Minister Izubuchi and Trustee Akahoshi of the Army Reporting Department, Lieutenant Commander Arita of the Navy Reporting Department, Matsudaira of the Embassy Reporting Department, Consul Fukama Kaori, and Interpreter Ikeda. On the host side, the attendees included President Obata of the Mainland New Daily, Editor-in-Chief Hidaka of the New Shen Bao, Xu Liqun of the China Daily, Chen Binhe of the Shen Bao, Jin Xiongbai of the Ping Bao, Weng Yongqing of the New China Daily, Lu Feng, Cheng Zhongquan of the Xinwen Bao, Huang Jingzhai of the Guomin Xinwen, and chief editors of various newspapers, totaling over 30 people. During the banquet, Chen Binhe stood up to deliver a speech, saying that the New Association has been established for a year and a half, and has always strived to do its best in propaganda with a spirit of autonomy.

<h3>Major Salt Field Talks About the Pacific War Situation: The Japanese Army is Prepared to Thoroughly Strike the Enemy</h3>
<p>The joint press conference hosted by the three authorities of the Allied forces in Shanghai, land, sea, and air, was held yesterday (4th) at 3:00 PM on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, to meet with Chinese news reporters in this city. Major Salt Field of the Fleet Reporting Department was present, entrusted to Wang Bingnan, Liu Zhennan, etc. Deputy Consul Fukuma of the Embassy's Shanghai Office was also present. Major Salt Field immediately answered in detail the questions raised by the reporters regarding the recent war situation in the Pacific. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Heavy Losses for the Enemy in the Mariana Islands</p>
<p>Major Salt Field said that the fighting in the Mariana Islands was fierce, especially on Saipan Island. The Japanese army had inflicted heavy blows on the enemy, and the damage to the American army was quite heavy. In addition, on Miyakojima, the Japanese army has been actively gathering in the north. At the same time, all Japanese residents on the island bravely cooperated with the Japanese army. However, there has been no activity of warships near the island. It is believed that the garrison troops on the island are currently quite exhausted and are waiting for the attacking enemy to launch an attack to give them a thorough and severe blow.</p>
<p>The Significance of Dividing Military Administration and Military Orders</p>
<p>Major Salt Field continued to explain in detail the significance of the Japanese government's division of military administration and military orders this time, and said that General Oikawa's new position as Minister of Military Orders and General Oikawa's original position as Minister of the Navy show the attitude of refreshing the situation in the midst of the decisive battle. Moreover, General Shimada will participate in military affairs as a military advisor from now on. General Shimada has made great contributions over the years, and he will make even greater efforts in the future. He is gentle and kind, and he is most suitable for this position. General Oikawa has a systematic approach to research, and the general public trusts him especially. Five or six years ago, when he served as the commander of the stationed troops, he collected quite a lot of ancient Chinese books, and he had a good understanding of Chinese history. His research on Chinese literature is very profound. This appointment can be said to be suitable for his talents and abilities. He is not only an outstanding talent in the Navy, but also deeply expected by the general public in the country.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers' Morale is Greatly Boosted</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Salt Field also said that the Japanese people have great expectations for the Navy, and the planned operation is gradually progressing. Finally, he said that the morale of the officers and soldiers is increasingly boosted, and all are willing to go to the front line for a decisive battle. They are now requesting orders and waiting to be dispatched.</p>

<h3>Calligraphy and Painting Industry Should Also Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhiyuan</p>
<p>Now, all industries have the responsibility to pay taxes and fulfill the obligations of citizens. Even bank deposits and employee salary slips have the obligation to pay income tax. However, there is a group of celebrities in Shanghai who call themselves calligraphers, painters, epigraphers, and art collectors, who have never taken the responsibility of paying taxes. The daily income of this industry is quite considerable. If you are looking for a famous calligrapher or painter, it costs tens of thousands of yuan, or thousands of yuan. Moreover, their fees and commission rates can be increased at any time and are not subject to any restrictions. In Shanghai alone, there are no less than tens of thousands of calligraphers, painters, and engravers. If they pay a small amount of tax each month according to their income, it is really a drop in the bucket, and it will add another source of income for the country. As for those who seek calligraphy and painting, they should be wealthy and willing to spend a lot of money to seek the work of famous artists to please their eyes, or to keep it for a hundred years or so to sell it at a good price. Therefore, it is not too much to say that those who seek micro-loans should pay luxury retail tax. Now I suggest a few items as follows:</p>
<p>Led by the relevant parties, the major fan shops should establish a calligraphy and painting industry and engravers' association to unify management.</p>
<p>All calligraphers, painters, and engravers should register with the association, and then the association should apply for a license on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Prevention Methods for Dysentery</h3>
<p>It is now summer, the weather is hot, and people's resistance is reduced. If you are not careful, diseases will follow. Dysentery has already been discovered recently. The Hualian Factory Pharmaceutical Medical Laboratory has specially described the source of dysentery and prevention methods for the reference of citizens.</p>
<p>Dysentery is divided into two major categories: Amoeba dysentery and Bacterial dysentery. The former is caused by Amoeba protozoa, and the latter is transmitted by dysentery bacteria. Every summer, there are more patients than in other seasons. The reason for this is related to melons, fruits, and flies.</p>
<p>Now is the season for melons and fruits, and it is also the time for flies to breed. Melon and fruit stalls can be seen everywhere on the road, and flies gather and cannot be driven away. Therefore, the most opportunities to transmit diseases are at this time. Although chemical methods can be used to disinfect before eating melons, such as soaking them in a potassium permanganate solution, sometimes there are too many bacteria, and the drug is not strong enough to kill the bacteria, so the effect is often minimal.</p>
<p>Dysentery bacteria are transmitted from the stomach. After passing through the stomach acid, they cannot be killed or reduced, so they enter the intestinal tract, where they multiply endlessly and secrete 33% of bacteria. It can be seen that dysentery is related to melons, fruits, and flies.</p>
<p>Prevention methods: Eat less melons, fruits, and cold drinks to reduce the chance of infection. Install screens in toilets or kitchens to prevent flies from flying in. Disinfectant water, such as carbolic acid or lysol water, should be sprinkled frequently in places where flies gather to prevent their breeding. Stone lime powder and bleaching powder are cheaper. Patients with dysentery or other infectious diseases should be sent to isolation hospitals for prompt treatment. Wash hands frequently before eating. It is hoped that citizens will work hard together to prevent the occurrence of infectious diseases.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Clinic Offers Preferential Treatment to the Poor</h3>
<p>The Anti-Tuberculosis Association and the Chinese Catholic Medical Association jointly established the Fourth Tuberculosis Clinic at 197 Yueyang Road (Fen Qi Qi Road). It has been open for more than a month, and the clinic is very developed. The clinic recently learned that tuberculosis is the most common disease among Chinese patients. If you do not follow the correct path and treat it with peace of mind, it will be impossible to save. Today, medicine is expensive, and where do poor patients get such high medical expenses? Therefore, preferential treatment methods have been formulated. Anyone suffering from this disease can apply to this office for an introduction to the clinic for treatment. The fees are divided into four types: free, half-fee, ordinary, and special. The fees are collected according to each person's situation. Registration fee: half fee 5 yuan, ordinary 10 yuan, special 30 yuan. X-ray fluoroscopy: half fee 25 yuan, ordinary 50 yuan, special 100 yuan. Artificial pneumothorax: half fee 50 yuan, ordinary 100 yuan, special 200 yuan. Medicine fee: half price according to the wholesale price, ordinary according to the wholesale price, special according to the wholesale price plus 20%.</p>
<h3>Free Malaria Pills</h3>
<p>A letter from Moore Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory: "I have the honor to send you 1,500 loose tablets of our factory's sacred medicine for malaria, 'Pumian Ning tablets'. Please distribute them to the poor and sick. Due to electricity restrictions, our factory does not produce much, and the number is small, which is just a token of our intentions. There are also"</p>
<p>According to Moore Pharmaceutical Factory, it previously donated "Sesilong tablets" to this office for charity, and now it is willing to donate "Pumian Ning tablets." At this time of autumn and summer, when malaria is prevalent, it is of great benefit to the poor and sick. In addition to thanking them, we will distribute them on their behalf.</p>
<p>Free Diagnosis and Medication: Dr. Wang Gongjian, a disciple of the national doctor Lu Shi'e, has the intention of saving the world and provides free diagnosis and medication. All poor patients who seek medical treatment only need to pay a registration fee of 10 yuan. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Free diagnosis and medication coupons are printed and can be obtained from this office or from the clinic of the national doctor Tu Gongjian at 35 Bo Boy Fang, Luban Road.</p>
<p>Bade Lecture and Entertainment: The Chinese Confucius Learning Association is scheduled to hold the Rude Festival (Tuesday) on the 2nd of the month, starting at 3:00 PM, at the Hubei Society on Guizhou Road. A Rude Lecture and Entertainment Conference will be held, inviting Mr. Wen Lanting, Tan Tiankai, Pan Yangyao, and Wang Shifu to give lectures on the Eight Virtues. The president of the association, Lin Kanghou, will give the opening speech, and the youth group Ruan Zhiqiang, Wang Dunshu, Wang Dunhe, and Shen Huimin will also give lectures. The event will be followed by a "Pipa Solo" by the famous musician Wei Yuele, and Wang Dunshu and others will perform martial arts. It is expected that there will be a grand event at that time.</p>
<p>School Equipment: A certain Buddhist organization has recently established a rural primary school in Nanxiang in order to save out-of-school children in rural areas. It is now planned to solicit 50 to 100 desks and chairs, and other school equipment is also welcome. If there are any enthusiastic educators who are willing to sell at a low price, please come to Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road to discuss, telephone 33855.</p>
<p>Lost Keys: Yesterday at 6:30 PM, seven keys were found at the Donghua Stadium. I have specially sent them to your office for the owner to claim. (Yan Tingde)</p>
<h3>Blood and Tears (9) The Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by a foreigner</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Sakuma should have been at the conning tower, Lieutenant Harayama of the engine crew should have been by the motor, Petty Officer 1st Class Suzuki of the engine crew should have been by the gasoline engine, the helmsman should have been by the propeller, and the airman should have been in front of the air tank. It can be said that they each stayed at their posts in the face of their impending deaths and diligently performed their duties.</p>
<p>Only two people left their posts: Lieutenant Hasegawa and Petty Officer 1st Class Kadota. However, the bodies of both men were found at the site of the broken gasoline pipe. The fact that they abandoned their posts proves that they fought against the strong gasoline smell, blocking the rupture with their bodies until their last breath.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Yoshikawa and Captain Nakajo wept bitterly for them, as they certainly should. They believed that the sacrifice of these submariners was indeed a "death" weightier than Mount Tai.</p>
<p>"Good!"</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Yoshikawa's comment was simple, but it was enough to move people.</p>
<p>Following the lieutenant colonel were the chief medical officer and nurses from the mother ship Toyohashi, who entered the submarine and examined the bodies in detail. They then wrapped the corpses in thick blankets and placed them aboard the Toyohashi. All the crew members wept as they dressed the fourteen dead bodies in new uniforms. In a short while, when the Toyohashi quietly entered Kure Port, the commander-in-chief specially ordered all mooring vessels to welcome these victims with a boarding ceremony.</p>
<p>Later, the respect for Captain Sakuma immediately increased a hundredfold. This was because a small booklet was found in the captain's uniform.</p>
<p>The first person who found it thought it was just a small notebook with random pencil scribbles and did not pay much attention to it. But after reading it carefully, everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>It was a testament that would last forever. In that kind of environment, in that fateful situation, to be able to write such words was truly indicative of an unprecedented sense of will and duty.</p>
<p>At the same time as the sinking, the lights went out. By the faint light of a flashlight, Captain Sakuma, gasping for breath amidst the foul smell of gasoline, finished writing. Until the moment his consciousness was clear, he wrote without omission: the cause of the sinking, everything that happened after the sinking, as well as hopes for the future of submarines, the kindness of superiors to subordinates, farewells to seniors, and so on.</p>
<p>The captain was indeed worthy of being called a superman. At that time, the captain was only thirty-one years old, and his wife had passed away the year before, leaving behind only a two-year-old daughter. (128)</p>
