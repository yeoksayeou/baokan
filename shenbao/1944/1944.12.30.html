<p>東京二十九日中央社電　明多羅島之敵敵軍，建修機場滑走路二條，二十二日停駐小型機多架，這日空軍連日猛炸及二十六日水上部隊之猛攻，受損甚大，據二十七日偵察報吿稱：該地兩機塲已呈混亂狀態，原有敵機百二十架乃至百六十架，現減至八十架。二十七·八兩日，日機兩度空襲該地，二十七日敵機塲設施十五處及汽油堆積所一處，被炸起火，敵再建企圖悉遭粉碎。</p>

<h3 id="c8">渝軍一年來損失七十萬 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>南京二十九日中央社電　本年度中國日軍作戰自平漢綫貫通作戰以來，湖南作戰，福建沿岸作戰，廣西作戰，北緬作戰等，相繼於中國日軍及緬甸派逍軍給予抗戰之渝軍損失，其中央直系軍及美式渝軍達百數十師以上。根據各種資科調查，計完全潰滅者爲十五師，傷亡爲七十萬。計河南作戰二十萬，湖南廣西作戰三十萬，北緬作戰二十萬。按例年渝軍損失，民國三十年爲二十三萬，民國三十一年爲二十一萬，民國三十二年爲二十四萬。蓋以了茲決戰階段，渝軍所受損先亦形增大，同時因日軍佔領地域增大，渝兵力補給益形減少，廣範圍之徵募區逐漸喪失，平漢綫失陷後，兵力來源減少的爲八軍，湖南廣西地方的十軍，總計不下十八軍，故渝軍今後於戰鬥方面，消耗之補充愈感窘狀。傳渝軍當局，在力謀對策中，如軍師强兵辦法之修正，兵役法之修正，殘餘各師旅之抽調訓練，編練新師更爲求强化徵兵本宜，於九月成立兵役部，動員十萬之學生，十月上旬共集約三十萬國民黨員，以之編爲美式渝軍，實足顯示渝軍兵力之缺乏。加之本年度渝軍作戰物的損耗，似達三萬噸，相當例年之二倍以上損耗，適當渝軍四十師之裝備，故其補充，必須一年以上，更以武器彈藥之有力補充某地，桂林，柳州各兵工場之喪失，今後渝軍之補充，益爲困難，渝軍本年度之損耗，已如上述。加之國內國共相尅，更影響其補充工作，故一切補充對策，一如具文，僅民國三十二年之損耗補充必須一年以上，渝軍抗戰前途已有一深刻之影響。</p>
<h3 id="c9">松島部長報告　菲島最近戰局　預料明春有大規模攻擊 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>盟邦駐華艦隊報道部，昨日下午二時循例舉行報道常會，松鳥部長報吿太平洋戰局及德國反攻勝利情形。茲誌於左：</p>
<p>敵美攻勢逐一擊破</p>
<p>敵方宣傳在菲律賓作戰態勢極爲有利，但日方對敵方攻擊，逐决擊破，日航空部隊對敵方在摩羅泰及明多羅鳥之敵方航空基地及補給基地，均予以相當打擊，對明多羅海每次發現之敵運輸航團，均立刻予以殲滅打擊，由蘇魯灣至明多羅鳥海峽，有六百海哩長，爲敵方最有利對日之攻擊路綫，日方似乎用一袋子吸收敵方。敵方現從新幾內亞方面，正在對此方繼續補充，亦似乎爲敵方之最後補充，日方對敵補充已予以相當挫折，使敵已歸失敗，尤其自二十六日以來，日水上部隊及航空部隊，對明多羅島的桑霍塞所予之激烈攻擊，致使桑霍塞一帶及明多羅島基地，已體無完膚。此次攻擊之激烈，爲十月下旬菲律賓海面激戰後所僅見，使敵方遭遇意外之攻擊，頗受致命打擊。</p>
<p>日本海軍準備完成</p>
<p>敵方從雷伊泰島方面屢次宣傳作戰局勢有利，然而尼米資及福萊斯特兩將軍均在申述太平洋戰局之不利，彼等均根愈與日本接近，愈遭逢到日本基地航空部隊的打擊，他們的話不啻將戰局眞相全盤托出。日本海軍自十月中旬到現在，可謂菲律賓海戰後的整備期間，現在整備完成，預料明年新春，又將開始大規模攻擊矣。敵方自十月上旬到現在，經過兩個半月的長時間，尙未能完成菲律賓作戰，而自吹自擂，宣傳作戰有利，可謂荒謬之至</p>
<p>大陸戰綫戰略空襲</p>
<p>關於大陸方面敵方飛機，大陸方面敵機近時作戰略的空襲，如最近對上海周圍的偵察，以及對日本補給路綫的攻擊行動。上次敵方對漢口曾經作慘無人道的轟炸，而受害者均爲中國人民。日方對敵方此種轟炸，以增加航空機的生產，壓迫敵方航空機的活動，俾使受害程度減至最小限度。</p>
<p>德國反攻英美束手</p>
<p>其次德國在歐洲方面對英美攻擊，使英美受到極大影響，可加以考慮。上次倫台斯特將軍說：敵方費三個月工夫所侵佔之地盤，德軍十日內奪回，並殲滅敵方七個師團，宛若在戰賂上打進一個木塞進去。德軍之勝利，因經長時的訓練及最精銳戰鬥機戰車，以及V1號V2號新式武器的威力，遂致艾森霍華及蒙高茂萊兩將軍，均束手無策。同時在英美方面政見上亦起變化，如最近巴爾幹問題及希臘叛亂問題，均使政治上日漸黑暗起來。相信今後德國攻勢愈激烈，其影響太平洋戰局者亦愈大，德國攻勢已打破過去英美的物量優勢，在德作戰已打開一個新生命。現在太平洋作戰亦正在白熱化，已將當前激烈戰局打開，相信來春定可形成一個光輝燦瀾的戰局，敵美現已將各地殘兵集合起來，作最後的攻擊了。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c10">決戰宣傳 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>日前國府明令發表，宣傳部長更迭。在此決戰時期，前方戰爭形勢，已經到了千鈞一髮的緊張階段，後方國民自當益加淬勵，應付非常局面，所以，今日的決戰宣傳，輿論指導方法，必須煥然一新，振作精神，以期更有效的發揮總力。於此，我們對於決戰宣傳，貢獻管見若干，以供參考：</p>
<p>第一，喚起國民決戰情緒，益發堅定必勝信念。大東亞戰爭的本質，是消滅英美侵略勢力，解放東亞十憶民族，完成亞洲人的亞洲，這已是衆所周知了。可是，敵人英美爲企圖延續其侵略壽命，不惜傾其殘餘勢力，作孤注一擲，所以，目前的戰局非常激烈。我們爲突破緊急戰局，使戰爭好轉，則最主要的工作，就是全體國民同舟共濟，各自在本身崗位上，盡力奮鬥。換句話說，在此生死存亡的重要關頭，益發堅定必勝信念，各盡各能，報效國家。更應抱定「我不奮起，誰來奮起」的自我犧牲精神。所以，決戰宣傳的第一任務，必須基此信念喚起國人決戰情緒，發揚光大。</p>
<p>第二，宣傳報道，背後應有事實根據。期望國民各自努力，發揮總力，必須使每個國民充分認識當前的眞實事態與情勢，國民有了充分認識以後，縱使政府不必多言，國民的情緒也必自然提高，也必目發突破難關的勇氣。其决，應以工作爲宣傳，不以宣傳爲工作。使國民信仰宣傳報道，接受輿論指導。</p>
<p>第三，尊重民間輿論，指導國民運動。民間以純潔動機與目的而自動表示的言論，自動發起的運動，因爲期望完成戰時任務，所發的言論，或所形成的國民運動，自然是活潑而現實的，由於這種言論與運動的展開，戰爭情緒就會更加昂揚，政府對此民問言論與國民運動，不但放任，尤須尊重，進一步善爲指導，以期發生最大的效力。誠然，政府號召國民發起或組織運動，也是緊要的事，但是出於國民憂國憂時的至情流露，所發的公正言論與運動，更須表示歡迎。當然，對於動搖戰爭信念，或洩露軍事外交上的機密，或足以促便國內意見分裂，以及其他阻撓，或妨礙戰爭進行的一切言論或運動，在此決戰嚴重關頭，自應加以嚴屬取締，這是毫無猶豫而須特別注意的。</p>
<p>第四，促使民生安定，爭取戰時國民心理的擁戴。在此戰時自以爭取戰爭勝利爲第一要義，不過，同時也不能忽視人民生活的最低限度安定，減少可以避免的痛苦，使國民心理發生擁戴的諒解，甘於忍受艱苦生活而貢獻於戰爭。這固然不是宣傳方面所能直接做到的，但是盡其贊助促進的力量，自應竭盡智能做去。</p>
<p>其次，對於宣傳的技按術，也有重視必要，八股與公式適足失却人民信心，都應避免。例如街頭巷尾，到處張貼標語，効力極微，徒損市容觀瞻。這不過極小的一例。總之，決戰宣傳，政府應充分具有信賴國民忠誠，憂慮國民忠誠，勉勵國民忠誠的情緒，指導輿論，促其實現。同時，國民自也應體諒政府意旨，打成一片，共同向完成勝利的目標以進。</p>

<h3 id="c28">拉巴爾要塞近況 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>「戰鬥前的一滴汗就是戰鬥中的一滴血！「這是毅然在敵美重圍中堅守太平洋最前綫的拉巴爾守備隊的口號。在以龐大的物量爲後盾，從所羅門羣島向北推進的敵美跳島作戰之下，以寡敵衆，建樹戰史上罕見的大戰果的日軍，其英勇的行動，已轟動了全世界。今日，日軍堅守下的拉巴爾，在南方佔領地帶陸海軍最高指揮官統率之下，鬥志更堅，軍勢益振，正如據守金剛山天險以抗浸山遍野的賊軍的楠公，貫撤無畏是的精神，克服困難，打開隘路，堅守拉巴爾，成爲侵人菲烏的美軍後方的一大威脅，對於現下的太平洋決戰，實多裨益。</p>
<p>拉巴爾位於所羅門，新幾內亞，吉爾伯特，馬紹爾的中央部分，儼然成爲對抗敵美反攻的要衝。但去歲十月至十一月間，雖在六次布根維爾鳥洋面航空戰中收得赫赫大戰果，仍未能完全殲滅敵軍，因而敵軍終於得在布根維爾島及新不列島登陸，拉巴爾的苦鬥遂吿開始。</p>
<p>固若金湯</p>
<p>敵軍眞正的航空侵寇作戰從一月上旬開始，迎日以一百五十架到二百架的敵機大編隊飛來空襲，以飛行塲爲主要目標，施行轟炸，展開了以新不列顚島爲中心的爭奪制空權的劇烈航空消耗戰。而且，將其地自吉爾伯特推進到馬紹爾的尼米資攻勢，到了二月，更長驅直衝洋心，進犯特魯克，於是戰局頓吿轉變，拉巴爾也逐漸轉移制空權，幸而敵軍不曾發覺，照舊傾其主力於轟炸飛行塲。這期間正是極寳貴的時間。慢慢在制空權方面有了自信的敵機，從三月上旬起，才開始移轉目標，攻擊倉庫及居住地帶等地上設施。拉巴爾的市街，使僅在兩三日中，都化爲廢墟，但因重要設施已經分散完畢，所以防衛戰力一點未受損害。</p>
<p>可是，敵機的來製，依然繼續不息。到了三月四日，拉巴爾與後方的連絡即吿杜絕。五日起，來襲敵機每日平均的一百架，八日以降，減爲五十架左右，最近每日仍有三十架到七十架的敵機飛來空襲。在這敵機的猛烈空襲之下，以築城。訓練及食糧自給三項爲重點，拉巴爾開始要塞化。</p>
<p>於此極受限制的環境中，爲了完遂大事業，打破不可能，第一是選拔適當的人材，組織創意班，凝集全體的叡智與鬥魂，着着推進建設工作。食糧雖不豐饒，但最要緊的是完成防衛勢態，從三月起，陸海軍就通力合作，全面展開防禦工事。在堅固的岩山中，掘成洞窟，司令部即設在金剛堂——這是因大楠公的忠誠而命名的。其他收容全體守備隊的居所，以及工廠。發電所。倉庫。手術室。病房等，無不俱備。同時，並着着構築戰重壕。塹壕等可以邀擊侵攻敵軍的陣地。兵器的自給，經過艱苦的試騐以後，也吿實現。目前，沒有武器的僱員。工員。文官等，都有拉巴爾製的兵器了。而汽車也照常行駛，電力也能供給，各要點並裝有特創的强力新武器。不論洞窟或陣地，當然都在周到綿密的計畫和設計之下稱築成功的，而且在極短的期間內，以不休不眠的精神，迅速完成。現在，已在着手第二期的大規模計畫。拉巴爾已經固若金湯，不怕敵軍攻打了。</p>
<p>自給自足</p>
<p>守備隊士兵的最大樂事，便是農耕。和日本內地不同，在灼熱的太陽照射下，在敵機的空襲轟炸下，一天勞動九小時，決不是寫意的事情，可是，勞苦固然勞廚師，食糧生產的喜悅畢竟是大的。從六月起，即以交代制由各隊抽出四分之一的人力從事農耕。有一個時期，曾靠些少的貯藏，每餐吃一點飯，一撮鹽，一碗湯，繼續和堅硬的岩石奮鬥，拚命掘洞。那時，大家心中都感到憂悶，因爲敵軍眞來了，索性爲國犧牲，倒也罷了，要是不來，逍樣下去，人也會由於營養不够而病倒了的。不過，這種憂愁，隨着嫩芽的成長，一天天淡了。最初栽培的是四個月餘就可收穫的甘藷，接着種下八個月熟的泰匹奧加（一種大戟科熱帶植物），二個月半的豆，及其他陸稻。芋。菓等物。耕地每日擴張，密林遂漸開拓，山岩相續崩平。沒有季節的拉巴爾山野，今日已逐漸成爲「豐稔的秋天」了。至於砂糖，從營養方面說來，缺了也不要緊，所以在第二期栽種。因每日劇烈勞動，士兵都很喜愛甜食。目下，已開始支給自製的飴糖。而甘庶的種植也很繁茂。某一時期，由於缺少鹽分，士兵都不健康，但由創意班的設計，已能利用海水和日光製監了。</p>
<p>士氣旺盛</p>
<p>最困難是動物性蛋白質不足。由於敵機的轟炸，不能在拉巴爾的海上捕魚。可是，士兵仍輪流組織打漁隊，冒着敵機的危險，於夜間出發，將所得些的獲物，全部供給在病院中療養的戰友。此點在鷄方面則採取根本解決的辦法。據有經騐的養鷄專家說，士兵的食糧尙且不很充分的時候，養鷄畢竟是不可能的。而門外漢則說如果飼糧不够，可以殺掉來吃，何况多的是野草昆虫。現在，已組成養鷄班，蛋已全部孵化，到明年四月裏，將可實行一人三隻的大增產計劃了。養鷄成功以後，並已開始養豬了。而且烟草也栽培起來了。烟酒是相連的，但沒有酒勞動力還不至於降低，沒有烟，那可難熬了。因此，以嗜烟者自種自製爲原則，最近一人已可一天摘取一張烟葉了。飯後抽一支杜製的捲烟，其樂無窮。此外，並紡絲織布，織造日常所需的手巾之類，且計畫裁製衣服。</p>
<p>敵軍對於日軍這種不折不撓的開拓精神，不禁瞠目。「耕地已達三千英畝了。」他們驚呼道。於是開始用飛機來玻壞農場。可是，南方植物的成長很快，西邊被炸壞，東面却已成熟，巨大的炸彈穴中，不到三日又可生滿了綠芽。而他們的濫炸，在密林地帶更無異很好的燒土法，往往本來是一片業莽，經過轟炸以後，不到一星爾卻成爲開墾了的耕地，綠油油充滿了生意。日軍將士心血所灌遭的拉巴爾農園，結果並未受到敵機轟炸的影響，反而日益靑葱，現在已每人平均可</p>
<p>十一月十七日本的新嘗佳節，拉巴爾方面也舉行盛大的遊藝會。</p>
<p>這一切都是日軍士兵血汗的結晶。爲滅敵精神之表徵的最高指揮官，也親立陣頭，與士兵同甘共苦，因而全軍的士氣極爲振作。（譯自十一月二十九日每日新聞）</p>

<p>市敎育局戴局長因鑒於近日物價暴漲，敎師生活淸苦，對於下學期學費問題，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>近日物價暴漲純由於造謠投機奸商之險惡行爲，整個社會蒙其影響，對我敎育同人威脅尤火，政府當局決採取嚴厲辦法，作斷然處置，物價平復，不久可期。至下學期公私立學校徵收學警標準一節，除市校原有規定外，本局根據規模較大歷史較久之私立中小學三百餘校之實際調查，求得本學期各校徵收學費之平均數字，均予以適當之增加，擬訂爲下學期之徵收標準，業於半月前呈請府部核示，不久指令到局，即行公布，令飭各校切實遵照辦理。至私校敎職員待遇，及經濟稽核，免費學額等項，在所擬收舊標準中，亦有所規定，俾於收費之中，而能兼顧敎師生活與學生免費，使學校行政趨於合理化。至純以增高學費牧入爲學校全部開支，實非妥善辦法，學費之無限制增加，學生失學者必衆，此乃事實，推其極，則能受敎育者均爲少數之富家子弟，大多數靑年，勢將宣吿失學，而學校亦將完全流於　店，失去辦學之旨，決非熱心敎育人士所應爲。且物價動盪不定，學費亦本能時增時減，故學校徵收學費，部令規定適當標準，其意義實爲重大。查私立學校本有校董會之設立，負籌劃經費改進校務之責，際此艱難之時，校董會應立即予以强化，盡其職責，同時政府自亦責無旁貸。此次對各私校敎職員之特種配給食米，即所以謀補助之道，今後更擬籌措經費，予以補助，并設法增加敎職員工之食糧配給或增加配給種類，以謀敎職員生活之改善，以此補彼，方是辦法。本人正與有關方面積極洽商，力求實現。至敎職員特種保險之業務部份，亦已由該委員會委託本局辦理，自當逐步實施。總之，敎職員生活之改善與夫避免學生之失學，實同等重要，期望我私校同人，應顧念時局艱難，深體辦學之旨，共肩鉅任，完成使命，倘有不顧時局嚴重，惟以增高學費造成學生失學，影響社會別有企圖者，本局當嚴予取締，以重敎育。</p>

<p>五島答：警察局因鍳於治安之必要，乃舉行社團登記，不論去登記與否，皆應申請登記　，倘逾期不登記之社團，當視情與有關當局聯絡，商量取締辦法，至「否則將嚴令解散」等語，當係文字之錯誤，故本局此次舉行社團登記，決非與過去有所抵觸。</p>
<p>樹柴漲價</p>
<p>記者問：本市樹柴來源頗暢，但近日售價竟已漲至每担七千元，市民燃料極感困雛，恐有人操縱居奇，經濟保安處能加以有效制止吾？</p>
<p>五烏答：關于燃料問題，本人今後當盡最大努力，加以調查，倘發現確係有奸商在間操縱，自當餒加取締，以安民生。</p>
<p>不遵限價</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The enemy forces on Mindoro Island have constructed two airstrip runways. On the 22nd, several small aircraft were stationed there. The air force has been carrying out fierce bombings daily, and the naval air force conducted a heavy attack on the 26th, causing significant damage. According to a reconnaissance report on the 27th, the two airfields in that area are in a state of chaos. The original 120 to 160 enemy aircraft have been reduced to 80. On the 27th and 28th, Japanese aircraft carried out two air raids on the area. On the 27th, 15 enemy airfield facilities and one gasoline storage depot were bombed and caught fire, thwarting the enemy's attempts to rebuild.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Base on the Philippine Front Lines, 29th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Kamikaze Special Attack Unit's Kongo Squad attacked enemy convoys attempting to reinforce their forces on Mindoro Island on the morning of the 28th, sinking three large 10,000-ton transport ships. These transport ships appeared to be fully loaded with military supplies. After being hit, they exploded upwards, visible even from a certain Japanese military base. On the same day, in the evening, Japanese air force units attacked an enemy transport convoy near the entrance to the Sulu Sea, sinking one large enemy transport ship and setting one large transport ship and one medium transport ship on fire.</p>
<p>Japanese Military Base in the Philippines, 29th (Central News Agency) – Elite units of the Japanese Air Force again attacked Mindoro Island on the night of the 27th, destroying the north and south airfields at San Jose, which the enemy forces were making great efforts to repair and reinforce. All Japanese aircraft safely returned to base. One team of Japanese aircraft launched two strong attacks on the 2,000-meter-long northern airfield runway, using courageous dive bombing, causing five or more locations to catch fire. They attacked the burial ground area at the southern end of the airfield, bombing and destroying its artillery positions. Another team, over the northern end of Mindoro Island, defeated enemy aircraft squadrons on patrol and attacked the southern airfield at San Jose, dropping giant bombs with precision, all of which hit the airfield runway. All Japanese aircraft leisurely and safely returned to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Tacloban, Leyte Island, MacArthur's headquarters announced on the 28th that Japanese naval units approached Mindoro Island on the night of the 26th and shelled the coastline, but were intercepted by American aircraft and fast torpedo boat squadrons and immediately retreated. Ground positions elsewhere were also subjected to heavy attacks by the Japanese Air Force and suffered considerable damage.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – At approximately 4:00 PM on the 28th, several enemy B-29 aircraft from bases in the Mariana Islands attempted to invade the Kanto region from the eastern sea off the Japanese mainland. However, perhaps fearing another painful defeat like the raid on the 27th, they only dropped some incendiary bombs over Ibaraki Prefecture. They failed to penetrate the airspace over the capital and retreated eastward over the ocean at approximately 4:40 PM. The Japanese side suffered almost no damage.</p>

During the first Konoe Cabinet in Showa 12 (1937), he served as Minister of Home Affairs. After leaving office, he engaged in a two-pronged political movement with a resolute character, fully utilizing his political activities. As a member of the New Order Preparation Committee, he was active in political circles.

<h3 id="e8">Chongqing Army Loses 700,000 Soldiers in One Year <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the current year's operations by the Japanese forces in China, including the campaign to secure the Pinghan Railway, the Hunan campaign, the Fujian coastal campaign, the Guangxi campaign, and the Northern Burma campaign, the Japanese forces in China and the expeditionary forces in Burma have inflicted heavy losses on the resistance forces of the Chongqing government. The Central Army and American-equipped units have lost over a hundred divisions. According to various sources, fifteen divisions have been completely annihilated, and total casualties amount to 700,000. This includes 200,000 in the Henan campaign, 300,000 in the Hunan and Guangxi campaigns, and 200,000 in the Northern Burma campaign. In previous years, the losses of the Chongqing forces were 230,000 in 1941, 210,000 in 1942, and 240,000 in 1943. However, with the current decisive phase, the losses suffered by the Chongqing forces have increased significantly. At the same time, as the area occupied by the Japanese forces expands, the Chongqing forces' replenishment of troops has decreased, and the extensive recruitment areas are gradually being lost. Since the fall of the Pinghan Railway, the source of troops has decreased by eight armies. The Hunan and Guangxi areas have lost ten armies, for a total of no less than eighteen armies. Therefore, the Chongqing forces will face increasingly difficult circumstances in replenishing their losses in combat. It is reported that the Chongqing military authorities are seeking countermeasures, such as revising methods for strengthening armies and divisions, revising conscription laws, redeploying and training remaining divisions and brigades, and forming new divisions to strengthen conscription. To this end, a Ministry of Conscription was established in September, mobilizing 100,000 students. In early October, approximately 300,000 Kuomintang members were gathered and formed into American-equipped Chongqing troops, demonstrating the Chongqing army's lack of manpower. In addition, the Chongqing forces' material losses this year are estimated at 30,000 tons, equivalent to more than double the usual annual losses, and equivalent to the equipment of forty Chongqing divisions. Therefore, replenishment will take more than a year. Moreover, the loss of armament factories in Guilin and Liuzhou will make it more difficult to replenish weapons and ammunition. The Chongqing forces' losses this year have been as described above. Coupled with the internal conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the replenishment effort is further affected. Therefore, all replenishment countermeasures are merely formalities. Replenishing the losses of 1943 alone will take more than a year. The future of the Chongqing forces' resistance has been profoundly impacted.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Department Chief Matsushima Reports on Recent Battles in the Philippines; Expects Large-Scale Attacks Next Spring <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The Allied Forces' Press Department in China held its regular press conference at 2:00 PM yesterday. Department Chief Matsushima reported on the Pacific War and the German counteroffensive. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Enemy American Offensives Repeatedly Defeated</p>
<p>The enemy is promoting their offensive in the Philippines as extremely advantageous, but the Japanese forces are resolutely repelling the enemy's attacks. The Japanese Air Force has inflicted considerable damage on enemy air and supply bases in Morotai and Mindoro. Enemy transport convoys detected in the Mindoro Sea are immediately destroyed. The 600 nautical mile stretch from the Sulu Sea to the Mindoro Strait is the enemy's most advantageous route for attacks against Japan. Japan seems to be using a "bag" to absorb the enemy. The enemy is currently continuing to replenish their forces from the New Guinea area, seemingly as their final replenishment. The Japanese forces have inflicted considerable setbacks on enemy replenishment, causing the enemy to fail. In particular, since the 26th, the Japanese naval and air forces have launched fierce attacks on San Jose on Mindoro Island, leaving the San Jose area and Mindoro Island base in ruins. The intensity of this attack was only seen during the fierce battles in the Philippine Sea in late October, and has caught the enemy by surprise, causing fatal damage.</p>
<p>Japanese Navy's Preparations Complete</p>
<p>The enemy repeatedly claims that the battle situation around Leyte Island is advantageous. However, Generals Nimitz and Forrestal have both stated that the Pacific War situation is unfavorable. The closer they get to Japan, the more they are attacked by Japanese-based air forces. Their words reveal the true state of the war. The Japanese Navy has been undergoing a period of preparation since the naval battle of the Philippines in mid-October. Now that preparations are complete, it is expected that large-scale attacks will begin again next spring. The enemy has not been able to complete their operation in the Philippines after a long period of two and a half months since the beginning of October, and yet they boast that the operation is advantageous, which is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Strategic Air Raids on the Mainland Front</p>
<p>Regarding enemy aircraft on the mainland, enemy aircraft have recently been conducting strategic air raids, such as reconnaissance around Shanghai and attacks on Japanese supply lines. The enemy previously carried out an inhumane bombing of Hankou, and the victims were Chinese civilians. Japan is responding to these bombings by increasing the production of aircraft and suppressing enemy aircraft activity, so as to minimize the damage.</p>
<p>Anglo-Americans Helpless Against the German Counteroffensive</p>
<p>The German attacks on Anglo-Americans in Europe are having a significant impact and should be taken into consideration. General Rundstedt said that the enemy had taken three months to capture the territory, but the German army retook it in ten days, and annihilated seven enemy divisions. The German victory, due to long training, the most elite fighter and tank units, and the power of V1 and V2 new weapons, has left Generals Eisenhower and Montgomery helpless. At the same time, political changes are occurring in the Anglo-American world, such as the recent Balkan problem and the Greek rebellion, which are making the political situation increasingly dark. It is believed that the more intense the German offensive becomes, the greater its impact on the Pacific War will be. The German offensive has broken the Anglo-American material superiority of the past, and has opened up a new life in the German war effort. The Pacific War is now also in a state of white-hot intensity, and a brilliant and splendid war situation will surely be formed next spring. The enemy Americans are now gathering remnants from various locations to make a final attack.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e10">War Propaganda <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The National Government recently issued an official order announcing a change in the Minister of Propaganda. During this decisive period, the war situation on the front lines has reached a critical stage. The people in the rear should strengthen themselves even more and prepare for an extraordinary situation. Therefore, today's war propaganda and methods of guiding public opinion must be completely renewed to invigorate spirits in order to effectively utilize total power. Here, we offer some humble opinions on war propaganda for reference:</p>
<p>First, arouse the people's determination for war and further strengthen their belief in victory. The essence of the Greater East Asia War is to eliminate the invading forces of Britain and the United States, liberate the one billion people of East Asia, and complete "Asia for Asians." This is already well known. However, in an attempt to prolong their aggressive life, the enemy Britain and the United States are willing to pour their remaining forces into a desperate gamble. Therefore, the current war situation is very intense. In order to break through the critical war situation and improve the war, the most important task is for all the people to stand together through thick and thin and strive to do their best in their respective positions. In other words, at this critical moment of life and death, we must further strengthen our belief in victory and each do our best to serve the country. We should also embrace the spirit of self-sacrifice, believing that "if I don't rise up, who will?" Therefore, the primary task of war propaganda must be to awaken the people's determination for war and promote their spirit based on this belief.</p>
<p>Second, propaganda and reporting should be based on facts. In order to encourage the people to work hard and exert total power, every citizen must fully understand the current real situation. Once the people have a full understanding, even if the government does not have to say much, the people's morale will naturally rise, and they will inevitably have the courage to break through difficulties. Therefore, work should be used as propaganda, not propaganda as work. Make the people believe in propaganda reports and accept public opinion guidance.</p>
<p>Third, respect public opinion and guide national movements. The opinions spontaneously expressed by the people with pure motives and purposes, and the movements spontaneously launched because they expect to complete wartime tasks, are naturally lively and realistic. As a result of the development of this kind of speech and movement, the war sentiment will become more enthusiastic. The government should not only tolerate this public opinion and national movement, but also respect it, and further guide it well so that it can produce the greatest effect. It is true that it is important for the government to call on the people to launch or organize movements, but it is even more necessary to welcome just speeches and movements that arise from the people's patriotic feelings. Of course, any speech or movement that shakes the belief in war, reveals military or diplomatic secrets, or is likely to cause divisions of opinion within the country, as well as any other speech or movement that obstructs or hinders the progress of the war, should be strictly prohibited at this critical moment of the war. This must be paid special attention to without hesitation.</p>
<p>Fourth, promote the stability of people's livelihood and win the support of national psychology during wartime. During this war, the first priority is to win the war, but at the same time, we cannot ignore the minimum stability of people's lives, reduce avoidable suffering, and make the people psychologically supportive and willing to endure hard lives and contribute to the war. This is not something that propaganda can directly achieve, but it should do its best to support and promote it.</p>
<p>Secondly, it is also necessary to pay attention to the skills of propaganda. Hackneyed and formulaic propaganda will only lose people's confidence and should be avoided. For example, posting slogans everywhere on streets and lanes has very little effect and only detracts from the appearance of the city. This is just a very small example. In short, in war propaganda, the government should fully trust the people's loyalty, worry about the people's loyalty, and encourage the people's loyalty, guide public opinion, and promote its realization. At the same time, the people themselves should also understand the government's intentions, unite as one, and work together towards the goal of victory.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - Okamura, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, recently hosted a banquet in honor of President Chen Gongbo. Commander-in-Chief Okamura delivered a speech first, followed by a response from President Chen. The following is an excerpt of President Chen's original response: "Your Excellency Okamura, I am deeply honored and grateful for your invitation amidst your busy military affairs today. In the middle of this month, I visited your country to express my gratitude to the government and people of your country for their courtesy and special care towards the late Chairman Wang, and for the warm hospitality extended to me. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite gratitude to Your Excellency. I am deeply grateful for your kind invitation and instructive words on the previous occasion. The colleagues of the National Government, inheriting the legacy of the late Chairman Wang, are determined to advance, sharing weal and woe with your country, even to the point of living and dying together, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, as is well known to Your Excellency and your staff. However, I am deeply ashamed that, since participating in the war, although the colleagues of the National Government have exerted their utmost efforts, their contribution to the war has not been great. This is something we cannot help but blame ourselves for. At the same time, the colleagues of the National Government can take comfort in the fact that Your Excellency once said, 'Today's war is a total war.' Therefore, all people, from the National Government down to the common people, have done their duty to consolidate the rear of the Greater East Asia War. I believe that in order to strengthen and consolidate the rear, we should, in the future, grasp strongholds and strive for overall control militarily, rectify officialdom and win over the people politically, and adjust people's needs and continue production economically. Although these principles are the established policy of the National Government, we cannot but hope that Your Excellency will give us the greatest sympathy and cooperation. There will be many more opportunities to receive your guidance in the future. I would like to raise my glass to wish Your Excellency good health and victory in the Greater East Asia War."</p>

<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in "German Magazine" that "If the world truly understands the words and deeds of the Führer Hitler and his deep love, they will surely worship the Führer. The Führer is the greatest creator of history, and his ability to see future events is far superior to others. Not only is his genius and political instinct superior to ordinary people, but his knowledge, integrity, and will are also extraordinary. He aims to liberate the people and transform Europe, so he rejects the pleasures of daily life and the enjoyments of the petty bourgeoisie. He spends most of his time with his close staff, and he never utters false or humble words. He can see what others cannot see, so with a wave of his hand and a word, he can solve problems that experts have debated for weeks without resolving."</p>

<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas Agency, the German forces on the Western Front are consolidating their captured territories, marking the beginning of the second phase of the winter battle on the Western Front. In the first phase, the German forces penetrated deep into the US First Army's defense zone and annihilated the US forces after destroying the German tank vanguard. As a result, the US forces in the Saar and Aachen areas were forced to retreat significantly. Eisenhower gathered fifteen divisions of troops to stop the German advance, and fierce fighting is underway. Enemy attacks south of Luxembourg have not succeeded.</p>

Anti-Axis forces are strengthening their resistance to the German forces along the entire southern front. US forces on the Bastogne (north of Luxembourg) highway were surrounded by the German army, starting a group tank battle since the Normandy battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities met with a group of reporters on the 28th, stating: (1) The greatest achievement of the German counteroffensive to date is the defeat and crushing of the anti-Axis offensive on the Aachen-Saar front, thwarting the enemy's attempt to attack the Ruhr-Saar industrial area. In this sense, the German operation can be described as a relief offensive. (2) The German forces have now annihilated or defeated US forces, including the 9th, 3rd, 7th, and 5th Tank Divisions, the 4th, 28th, 106th, 99th, 1st, 8th, 78th, and 83rd Infantry Divisions, and the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, a total of fourteen divisions.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat on the Outskirts of Budapest; German Forces Retreat to the West Bank of the Gran River <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, military sources report that the German forces fighting east of the Gran River (which flows northwest through Budapest into Slovakia) on Wednesday have retreated to the west bank of the river. The Soviet offensive has been repulsed. Between the Ebel and Sajo rivers, Soviet attacks have been repelled several times, and local penetrations have been filled in by the German forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas Agency, the battle for Budapest is intensifying. Soviet forces are moving their artillery towards residential areas, and the German-Hungarian Allied forces have concentrated all their defensive forces. After fierce fighting, Soviet forces only entered the outskirts of the city on the west bank of the Danube, where fierce fighting for every wall and every house broke out. German and Hungarian infantry engaged in close-quarters combat with Soviet forces using bayonets and hand grenades. The Soviet offensive has weakened after Soviet attacks on the German-Hungarian defense lines in the southeast and northeast of the city were defeated. West of Budapest, Soviet forces stationed in Székesfehérvár attempted to break into the plains southeast of Komárno (a key point in southern Slovakia), but were stopped southwest of Felsögalla. In the past two days, Soviet forces have lost 89 tanks in that area. Northeast of Budapest, German forces are plugging the gap between the Ebel and Sajo rivers, and all Soviet offensives have been repelled. On the left flank of the Soviet forces on Lake Balaton and the southern border of Slovakia, Soviet forces are engaged in fierce fighting. Soviet forces attacked west of Fornbach-Mitau in Kuran and Doblen. Soviet forces made slight progress north of Szőbelen, but the main lines are still in German hands.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Recent Conditions in Rabaul Fortress <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>"A drop of sweat before battle is a drop of blood saved in battle!" This is the motto of the Rabaul garrison, which resolutely defends the front line of the Pacific amidst the enemy's heavy encirclement. With vast material resources as their backing, the American forces have been advancing north from the Solomon Islands using the island-hopping strategy. The Japanese army, outnumbered, has achieved rare feats of arms in military history, and their heroic actions have shocked the world. Today, the Japanese army, which is holding Rabaul under the command of the Supreme Commander of the Army and Navy in the Southern Occupied Territories, is even more determined and its military strength is growing. Just like Kusonoki Masashige, who held the natural fortress of Mount Kongō against hordes of invading bandits, they are overcoming difficulties, opening up strategic passages, and holding Rabaul, becoming a major threat to the rear of the American forces invading the Philippines, which is of great benefit to the current decisive battle in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Rabaul is located in the central part of the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, Gilbert Islands, and Marshall Islands, and is a key point in resisting the American counteroffensive. However, although the six naval battles off Bougainville Island in October and November of last year resulted in great victories, they failed to completely annihilate the enemy. As a result, the enemy finally landed on Bougainville Island and New Britain Island, and the hard struggle for Rabaul began.</p>
<p>Impregnable Fortress</p>
<p>The enemy's real air raids began in early January, with large formations of 150 to 200 enemy aircraft flying in daily to bomb, mainly targeting airfields, launching a fierce air attrition war centered on New Britain Island to seize air supremacy. Moreover, the Nimitz offensive, which advanced from Gilbert to the Marshall Islands, advanced straight to Truk in February, and the war situation suddenly changed. Rabaul also gradually lost air supremacy. Fortunately, the enemy did not realize this and continued to focus its main force on bombing the airfields. This was a valuable time. The enemy aircraft, slowly gaining confidence in terms of air supremacy, began to shift their targets from the beginning of March, attacking above-ground facilities such as warehouses and residential areas. The streets of Rabaul were reduced to ruins in just two or three days, but because the important facilities had been dispersed, the defensive power was not damaged at all.</p>
<p>However, the enemy aircraft continued to attack relentlessly. On March 4, the connection between Rabaul and the rear was severed. From the 5th, the number of enemy aircraft raiding averaged 100 per day, decreasing to about 50 from the 8th, and recently there are still 30 to 70 enemy aircraft flying in daily to bomb. Under this intense air raid by enemy aircraft, Rabaul began to be fortified, focusing on three key aspects: construction, training, and food self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>In this extremely limited environment, in order to accomplish great things and break the impossible, the first thing was to select the right people, organize creative teams, and gather the wisdom and fighting spirit of the entire army to steadily advance the construction work. Although food was not abundant, the most important thing was to complete the defensive posture. From March, the army and navy cooperated fully to carry out defense works in all directions. Caves were dug in the solid rocky mountains, and the command post was set up in the Kongodo - named for the loyalty of the Great Kusonoki. Other facilities for housing the entire garrison, as well as factories, power plants, warehouses, operating rooms, and hospitals, were all equipped. At the same time, positions were being built to intercept invading enemy troops, such as war trenches and moats. The self-sufficiency of weapons was also realized after arduous testing. Currently, employees, workers, and civil servants who do not have weapons all have Rabaul-made weapons. Cars are also running as usual, electricity can be supplied, and key points are equipped with specially created powerful new weapons. Whether it is a cave or a position, of course, it is successfully built under careful planning and design, and completed quickly in a very short period of time with a tireless spirit. Now, the second phase of the large-scale plan is underway. Rabaul is now impregnable and not afraid of enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Self-Sufficiency</p>
<p>The greatest joy of the garrison soldiers is farming. Unlike mainland Japan, working nine hours a day under the scorching sun and under enemy air raids and bombings is by no means an easy task, but the joy of food production is still great. From June, each team was rotated to allocate a quarter of its manpower to farming. At one time, they relied on some small amount of storage, eating a little rice, a pinch of salt, and a bowl of soup for each meal, and continued to fight against the hard rocks, desperately digging caves. At that time, everyone felt depressed, because if the enemy really came, they might as well sacrifice themselves for the country, but if they didn't come, people would get sick from malnutrition. However, this worry faded day by day with the growth of the young shoots. The first crop to be cultivated was sweet potatoes, which could be harvested in just over four months, followed by eight-month-old tapioca (a tropical plant of the spurge family), two-and-a-half-month-old beans, and other upland rice, taro, and fruits. The cultivated land expanded daily, the dense forests gradually opened up, and the rocky mountains continued to be leveled. The Rabaul mountains and fields, which have no seasons, have gradually become a "fertile autumn." As for sugar, it is not essential from a nutritional point of view, so it is planted in the second phase. Soldiers love sweets because of the intense daily labor. Currently, the distribution of homemade candy has begun. The planting of sugar cane is also flourishing. At one time, soldiers were unhealthy due to lack of salt, but the creative team was able to make salt using seawater and sunlight.</p>
<p>High Morale</p>
<p>The most difficult thing is the lack of animal protein. Because of enemy bombings, it is not possible to fish in the sea around Rabaul. However, the soldiers still take turns organizing fishing teams, risking enemy aircraft, and setting out at night to provide all the proceeds to their comrades who are recovering in the hospital. In terms of chickens, a fundamental solution has been adopted. According to experienced chicken-raising experts, it is impossible to raise chickens when the soldiers' food is not very plentiful. But laymen say that if there is not enough feed, you can kill them and eat them, and there are plenty of weeds and insects. Now, a chicken-raising team has been formed, all the eggs have been hatched, and a large-scale production plan of three chickens per person will be implemented in April next year. After the success of chicken raising, pig raising has also begun. Tobacco is also being cultivated. Tobacco and alcohol are connected, but without alcohol, labor will not be reduced, but without tobacco, it will be difficult to endure. Therefore, smokers are encouraged to grow and make their own tobacco. Recently, one person can pick one tobacco leaf per day. There is endless joy in smoking a homemade cigarette after a meal. In addition, silk is spun and cloth is woven to make everyday necessities such as towels, and plans are being made to make clothes.</p>
<p>The enemy was amazed at the indomitable pioneering spirit of the Japanese army. "The cultivated land has reached three thousand acres!" they exclaimed. So they started using aircraft to destroy the farms. However, the growth of southern plants is very fast. When the west side is bombed, the east side is already ripe. The huge bomb craters are full of green shoots in less than three days. And their indiscriminate bombing is no different from good burnt-earth farming in dense forest areas. Often, what was originally a wilderness becomes cultivated land in less than a week after the bombing, full of green life. The Rabaul farm, which was irrigated with the blood and sweat of the Japanese soldiers, was not affected by the enemy air raids. Instead, it became greener and greener, and now each person can average</p>
<p>On November 17, the Japanese New Harvest Festival, Rabaul also held a grand carnival.</p>
<p>All this is the crystallization of the blood and sweat of the Japanese soldiers. The supreme commander, who is the symbol of the spirit of destroying the enemy, also personally stood at the head of the battle, sharing the joys and sorrows with the soldiers, so the morale of the entire army is extremely high. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun of November 29)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Director Dai Discusses Tuition Fee Collection for the Next Semester; Appropriate Standards Being Submitted to the Ministry for Approval <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Director Dai of the Municipal Education Bureau, in view of the recent soaring prices and the difficult lives of teachers, issued the following statement on the issue of tuition fees for the next semester:</p>
<p>The recent soaring prices are purely due to the sinister behavior of rumor-mongering, speculative merchants. The entire society is affected, and the threat to our education colleagues is particularly severe. The government authorities are determined to take strict measures and take decisive action. Price stabilization is expected soon. Regarding the standard for collecting tuition fees for public and private schools in the next semester, in addition to the existing regulations for municipal schools, the Bureau, based on actual surveys of more than 300 private primary and secondary schools with larger scales and longer histories, has obtained the average tuition fees collected by each school this semester, and has made appropriate increases to formulate the collection standards for the next semester. It was submitted to the government for approval half a month ago. The instructions will be issued to the Bureau soon and will be announced and ordered to be strictly followed by all schools. The proposed new standards also include provisions for the treatment of teachers and staff in private schools, as well as economic audits and free scholarships, so that the collection of fees can take into account the lives of teachers and free tuition for students, so that school administration can be rationalized. Purely increasing tuition fees to cover all school expenses is not a proper approach. Unlimited increases in tuition fees will inevitably lead to a large number of students dropping out of school. This is a fact. At its extreme, only a few wealthy children will be able to receive education, and the majority of young people will be declared out of school. Schools will also completely become shops and lose the purpose of running schools, which is definitely not what enthusiastic educators should do. Moreover, prices are volatile and uncertain, and tuition fees cannot be increased or decreased at will. Therefore, the Ministry's regulations on appropriate standards for school tuition fees are of great significance. Private schools have a board of directors, which is responsible for planning funding and improving school affairs. At this difficult time, the board of directors should be immediately strengthened and fulfill its responsibilities. At the same time, the government is also obligated to do its part. This special allocation of rice to teachers and staff in various private schools is a way to provide assistance. In the future, we plan to raise funds to provide subsidies and find ways to increase the food allocation or increase the types of rations for teachers and staff to improve their lives. This is the way to make up for it. I am actively negotiating with the relevant parties to strive for realization. The business part of the special insurance for teachers and staff has also been entrusted to the Bureau by the committee and will be implemented step by step. In short, improving the lives of teachers and staff and avoiding the loss of students from school are equally important. I hope that my colleagues in private schools should consider the difficulties of the current situation, deeply understand the purpose of running schools, and shoulder the heavy responsibility together to complete the mission. If there are those who disregard the severity of the current situation, only increase tuition fees to cause students to drop out of school, and affect society with other intentions, the Bureau will strictly crack down on them to uphold education.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Director Goto Discusses Fuel Price Limits; Press Conference Held Yesterday <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The 34th press conference of the Municipal Propaganda Office was held at 10:00 a.m. yesterday in the municipal government conference room. Goto Shigeru, Director of the Special High Police Department and Director of the Economic Security Department of the Police Bureau, attended the meeting to answer questions raised by reporters. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Registration of Social Organizations</p>
<p>Reporter: Recently, the Police Bureau issued a notice to register all social organizations. Those who have registered with the National Government, the Municipal Government, or other agencies must register, otherwise they will be strictly ordered to disband. If this rule is implemented, will it conflict with the various agencies that have already registered? Or are there errors in the reported articles? Please explain this by the Special High Department.</p>
<p>Goto replied: The Police Bureau is conducting the registration of social organizations out of the necessity of maintaining public order. Regardless of whether they have registered or not, they should apply for registration. If the social organizations fail to register after the deadline, we will contact the relevant authorities to discuss ways to crack down on them. The statement "otherwise they will be strictly ordered to disband" is probably a textual error. Therefore, the registration of social organizations conducted by this Bureau will not conflict with the past.</p>
<p>Tree Firewood Price Increase</p>
<p>Reporter: The source of tree firewood in this city is quite smooth, but recently the price has soared to 7,000 yuan per dan. Citizens feel extremely difficult to obtain fuel. There is concern that someone is manipulating the market for profit. Can the Economic Security Department effectively stop this?</p>
<p>Goto replied: Regarding the fuel issue, I will do my best in the future to investigate. If it is found that there are indeed unscrupulous merchants manipulating the market, I will naturally crack down on them to ensure the livelihood of the people.</p>
<p>Non-Compliance with Price Limits</p>
<p>Reporter: Merchants do not comply with the price limits set by the price assessment, and the prices of general commodities are also higher than the price limits. Why has the Economic Security Department not cracked down on this?</p>
<p>Goto replied: In the past, the Economic Bureau and this Department lacked close contact regarding price assessment, which caused many difficulties in promoting the work. In the future, we will discuss specific contact methods so that the evaluation and reporting work can be carried out in coordination. Cracking down on unscrupulous merchants will definitely achieve good results.</p>
<p>Warehouse Inspection</p>
<p>Reporter: Can the warehouse inspection situation be published to dispel public doubts?</p>
<p>Goto replied: Warehouse inspection is very important for stabilizing price policies. It is currently being carried out meticulously. Once the inspection is completed, it will be announced. However, during the inspection, I hope that all sectors of society will cooperate. If the inspection personnel have illegal acts, I hope that citizens will jointly report them.</p>

Given the imminent handover deadline, the Administration convened a joint meeting a few days ago with representatives from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Zhejiang Provincial Government, Anhui Provincial Government, and the Shanghai and Nanjing Special Municipal Governments to discuss handover procedures, funding issues, and all major cases concerning the future promotion of tax policies. As a result, regarding handover matters, it was decided that, to avoid delays and strive for simplicity, the Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance would issue a general order to all tax branch bureaus to copy the commercial registration and investigation forms from each region and send them to the receiving agencies appointed by the provincial and municipal governments for inventory and joint reporting by the deadline. Matters not completed and taxes not collected before December of this year will still be cleared and collected separately by the respective branch bureaus. From January 1, 1945, the collection on behalf will be the responsibility of the collecting agencies of the provincial and municipal governments to ensure a clear boundary. As for the voucher tax payment system previously approved by the Ministry of Finance for adoption by the Taxation Administration, the vouchers have already been printed and will be implemented simultaneously from January 1, 1945. The vouchers are divided into twelve categories, and the format is the same as that of stamp tax tickets.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau and the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, in light of the recent enemy air raids that have caused many innocent civilian casualties and left many homeless people stranded on the streets, plan to provide relief. They convened a meeting of responsible persons from various public welfare and charitable organizations, attended by Hirano and Fukuda from the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters, as well as more than 100 representatives from various social organizations. First, Director Zhou gave a report. Then, Hirano and Fukuda from the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters reported in succession that food relief was distributed by the Materials Allocation Office after the recent air raids. However, due to the cold weather, cotton clothing could not be distributed, and they requested enthusiastic donations from all sectors of society. After discussion, it was decided to solicit 1,000 sets of cotton clothing from various social groups, to be sent to the Bureau for redistribution by January 5 to provide relief to the disaster victims. The charitable organizations have agreed to actively raise funds, and it is expected that the target will be met and the clothing will be sent to the Social Affairs Department of the Air Defense Headquarters for inspection and distribution.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Saving on Celebratory Gifts to Support Education: Mr. Zhang Baocun's Commendable Enthusiasm <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Baocun, owner of CPC Coffee Company, previously donated 50,000 yuan through Mr. Yan Songfang to respond to this newspaper's special scholarship fundraising appeal, and was listed as the CPC Team. Recently, Mr. Zhang established a branch store on Taishan Road. Recognizing the urgency of the scholarship movement and practicing frugality, he first implemented a policy of no opening ceremony, no ribbon-cutting, and no distribution of goods. Instead, he converted congratulatory gifts into cash and donated them to the scholarship fund. Mr. Zhang has a wide circle of acquaintances, and his store was flooded with congratulatory guests. In addition to receiving over 200,000 yuan in congratulatory gifts, Mr. Zhang also saved over 80,000 yuan in opening expenses, bringing the total to 300,000 yuan, which he divided and donated 150,000 yuan each to this newspaper's scholarship fund and the Xinwen Daily's scholarship fund. Yesterday, Mr. Yan Songfang delivered a letter from Mr. Zhang, which stated: "Our company's Taishan Road branch store has opened, and we are deeply grateful for the presence of social celebrities, industry peers, advanced individuals, and friends from all walks of life, as well as for their generous gifts. The total cash received in congratulatory gifts was 231,600 yuan. After deducting 19,500 yuan for expenses, the remaining 212,100 yuan, along with the savings from not holding a ceremony, will be added to the scholarship fund for the benefit of all our friends, totaling 300,000 yuan, which will be divided and sent to your newspaper and the Xinwen Daily, 150,000 yuan each. Enclosed is a check for 150,000 yuan. Please verify receipt." Mr. Zhang's enthusiasm for supporting education and repeatedly donating large sums is truly admirable. His initiative to not hold an opening ceremony, save expenses, and convert congratulatory gifts into positive charitable acts is even more commendable. New businesses are opening every day in Shanghai's business community. We sincerely hope that others will follow his example to expand the scholarship fund. We eagerly await this.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dr. Jin Zhang personally delivered funds to form the "Pearl Baby" team. When I asked him about the meaning of the name, he said, "I love my children like 'pearl babies,' and I thought of poor students, who are also other people's 'pearl babies.' Considering others as myself, I cannot forget them." These few words can be said to be "full of profound meaning." I urge all members of society to mobilize and jointly promote the "special fundraising" mission.</p>
<p>Master of Daoyi Studio Sells Items to Support Education</p>
<p>A letter from the Master of Xu's Daoyi Studio states: "Respectfully, I have been collecting calligraphy and paintings for 20 years. I recently held a charity sale of over 100 pieces of calligraphy, paintings, literary objects, and playthings at the Chinese Painting Gallery Exhibition Hall as a commemoration. I am grateful to the charitable enthusiasts who generously purchased them, and to the enthusiastic friends who promoted the event. I am deeply grateful and honored. However, during the week, the results were somewhat diminished due to the wind and snow, and the commercial market was also turbulent, resulting in increased expenses. The total proceeds from the two charity sales were 359,100 yuan. After selling 9,000 yuan worth of items after the event, the total came to 368,100 yuan. After deducting 70,000 yuan for the Chinese Painting Gallery's one-week rental fee, 4,800 yuan for tips to the gallery's tea servers and doormen, and transportation costs, as well as 30,630 yuan for food, salaries, transportation, and miscellaneous expenses for three self-employed employees, and 3,800 yuan for printing invitation cards, labels, and postage, the total expenses amounted to 109,230 yuan, leaving a net income of 258,870 yuan. I have added to this amount to make it a total of 260,000 yuan. After donating 10,000 yuan each to the six relief projects organized by the special fundraising team of your newspaper's scholarship fund, the remaining 100,000 yuan will be donated to the Xinwen Daily's scholarship fund and other scholarship funds for the benefit of the purchasing public. Please disclose this information to show good faith. I wish you all the best."</p>
<p>Also, a letter from Mr. Zhang Jingli states: "Your newspaper is enthusiastic about supporting education, and the gentlemen are working hard to promote it, benefiting students greatly. I am deeply impressed. I hereby donate 20,000 yuan to form a team to express my humble intentions. I know that the contribution is small, but I hope it will not be despised."</p>

<p>Yesterday, Huxin Middle School (Physics and Chemistry Association) Fundraising Team 3 and Minli Middle School students also continued to fundraise. The spirit of the young students in bravely taking the lead is truly commendable. The enthusiastic support of the Pharmaceutical Association, Jiudatang, Guanghua Company, Zhongnan Bank, Huang Yuyi, Zhengtai Bank Colleagues, and Wang Shiyuan in forming teams is deeply appreciated. Mr. Zhang Jingli is the descendant of the wise man Zhang Guan of Nantong. Continuing his predecessor's legacy, he is dedicated to maintaining local education, industry, and charitable causes. His enthusiasm is commendable. He also donated miscellaneous items to support education, which is especially admirable. Teams 150 to 154 are donating part of the proceeds from the charity sale commemorating the 20th anniversary of the Master of Daoyi Studio's calligraphy and painting collection. Among them, there are many collectors. If they can all sacrifice and hold charity sales to support education and benefit poor students, "gathering and dispersing" is an ancient maxim. This is the time to rise up and follow the trend!</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Cup Basketball League concluded successfully last night with an awards ceremony and closing ceremony. The Zong team, the women's champion, showed no sign of fatigue and defeated Yikang again yesterday, completing a four-game winning streak with a wonderful performance that was widely praised. In another game, Sansheng and Xuebai each scored 19 points. The B group final between Renyu and Shan team was tense and exciting, no less than an A group game. Renyu won by only one point, 25 to 24. Renyu led 12 to 9 at halftime. In terms of shooting, Renyu made more shots than the Shan team, but the Shan team made more free throws than Renyu. The awards were presented by Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, who personally attended.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Responding to the "Righteous Beggar" Appeal: Qian Gongxia, Editor of Yulin <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>I was deeply moved after reading Mr. Yang Guangzheng's article on the origin of organizing the "Righteous Beggar Team." "If everyone could do this, then our country would not only not be so fragmented, but would have already become strong!" Although these words were spoken about Wu Xun, Mr. Yang, as a "righteous beggar," also initiated fundraising and vigorously promoted it, which has the same value. The Yulin magazine was founded by a small number of people in the education sector. Its purpose is to do its best for this fragmented motherland. The colleagues believe that only education can save our Republic of China. Today's national affairs are chaotic and those who are stubborn and arrogant are the result of past failures in education. Seeing such evil results, how can we not follow the spirit of the righteous beggar and strive to rescue out-of-school children? However, the colleagues' strength is weak, and Yulin is still in its infancy. It can only temporarily allocate 2,000 yuan from the first issue's expenses as a response. In the future, if there is a surplus, it will definitely donate as a member of the "Righteous Beggar Team," and at least one-tenth of the surplus will be used for scholarships!

<h3 id="e46">This Office Allocates Aid Funds to 23 Educational Institutions for Needy Children <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>This office believes that among social issues, considering the future interests of the nation, people, and society, the cause of nurturing and educating children is relatively the most important. There are originally many educational institutions in Shanghai that struggle to educate and nurture children. However, with prices constantly increasing, it is very difficult to provide for them, let alone accommodate street children. Therefore, on Children's Day last year, we held a children's welfare symposium and launched a fundraising campaign to rescue street children, named the Needy Children Aid Fund. We selected promising orphans and homeless street children and sent them to various educational institutions to receive appropriate education, hoping to turn them into useful people. Since its implementation, it has been well received by society, and donations have been pouring in. Now that we have accumulated a certain amount, we are acting on the principle of "receiving from society and using for society" and have allocated 120,000 yuan from the Needy Children Aid Fund to help 23 educational institutions known to this office, taking into account the circumstances. We have already notified them by letter to come to the office to collect the funds. They are: Christian Refugee Children's Home, 10,000 yuan; Disaster Relief Children's Home, Pingjiang Children's Home, Shanghai Children's Welfare Institute, Fuyu Gong'er Yuan, Poor Children's Handicraft Institute, Shanghai Refugee Children's Home, Emmanuel Orphanage, Bethel Orphanage, Bethany Orphanage, Tushanbin Orphanage, Ai Yu Tang, Shanghai Fuyou Yuan, Poor Children's Home, Guangci Poor Children's Home, Shanghai Huaiyou Yuan, Youyou Educational Institution, Renshan Nursery, Renji Nursery, Yang Dian Orphanage, Fuya School, Tong School, and中华聋哑协会, 5,000 yuan each, totaling the above amount.</p>
<p>Although this funding provides only a small supplement to each institution, it is all from the enthusiastic donations of various sectors of society on a daily basis. We deeply hope that the Needy Children Aid Fund will become even more active so that the efficiency of relief efforts will become even greater. Then, the merit of benefiting children will be by no means small!</p>

Therefore, I will donate all 27,000 yuan of the gift money to the six relief projects of your office for the benefit of all relatives and friends. Please accept it.

<p>A letter from the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association Assistance Association states: Respectfully, your office has united five religious groups to launch a winter relief campaign, holding porridge distributions and clothing distributions to save disaster victims from freezing and starvation. We deeply admire your benevolence and righteous deeds. Zi Rao and others are weak and lack talent, and we cannot commend your high moral character. We feel deeply ashamed. We respectfully offer 50,000 yuan to be used to make wheat cakes for the public, so that they can be distributed to the poor people to fill their stomachs. Our humble contribution is like a grain of millet in the vast sea. We are limited in our abilities, but we are doing our best to fulfill our responsibilities. We humbly submit this contribution. Zhu Zhiyao, Xue Zuheng, and Zhu Kongjia of the Shanghai Catholic Charity Association send our regards.</p>

<p>The Ren Ci Charity Association was founded in 1938. At that time, due to the incident, refugees in the Zhabei and Nanshi districts were left to starve after the disaster. Therefore, the association initiated and organized soup kitchens, clinics, clothing and coffin distributions, and various relief efforts such as burial assistance. It also established Ren Ci Elementary and Middle Schools to promote free education and cultivate impoverished children, provide free burial services, and provide free materials to help the poor. Over the years, it has worked hard, been pragmatic, and not pursued false praise. The number of beneficiaries is countless. As the severe cold arrives, the association, in view of the hunger and cold of the helpless poor, has already launched winter relief to benefit the poor. However, due to insufficient funding, it is hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life will generously donate and enthusiastically contribute so that righteous grain and benevolence can universally benefit all beings. The addresses of the various facilities currently operated by the association are listed below: (Soup kitchen and free elementary school) Zhijiang Temple, Song Park Road, Zhabei (Ren Ci Elementary and Middle School) 555 Huining Road, Nanshi (Free burial assistance) Inside the Xieqiao Funeral Home, Nanshi.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Children's Welfare Association Appeals for Donations; Still Hoping All Sectors Will Continue to Assist in Fundraising <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association's current fundraising campaign is nearing its end. Over the past two days, various sectors have sent donations enthusiastically, totaling more than 290,000 yuan. According to Chairman Lin Kanghou yesterday, this fundraising effort took place during a time when the city's finances were extremely tight. Yet, the appeal for donations still received widespread sympathy from all sectors, which is a great encouragement to us. The public's expectations for the association's efforts in this great era can also be imagined. However, due to soaring prices recently, expenses have increased dramatically, several times over, falling far short of the original budget. According to the current situation, it is not enough to maintain six months of expenses unless 10 million yuan is raised. Lin Kanghou also added that the association's fundraising was originally scheduled to end at the end of this month, but some committee members are still busy with many matters as the end of the year approaches and have been unable to finish on schedule. Therefore, the fundraising period will be extended until January 15th next year. We still hope that all philanthropists in society will sympathize with the suffering of orphans and the helpless, continue their efforts, generously donate large sums of money, embrace the ideal of universal care, and jointly accomplish this great undertaking.</p>
