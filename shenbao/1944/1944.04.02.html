<h3 id="c1">向印度進軍 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 唯善</p>
<p>問：最近各方面的目光，都集注於印緬戰局，究竟有什麼實際意義？一</p>
<p>答：在觀察印緬戰局之前，必須特別注意三點：第一，是在最近期內，由於蘇聯之繼續推進其攻勢，一般軍事觀察者認爲英美將有可能移用其對歐洲的戰力向太平洋方面活動；第二，是美國海空軍一度對馬紹爾及加羅林羣島實行偷襲，有人誤認日本因此將被逼採取守勢；第三，是英美渝合力在緬甸方面作軍事活動，敵方更誇張爲對緬反攻。由此三者，一般人不免發生種種揣測。現在日軍協同印度國民軍向印度國境推進這一事實，就澈底粉碎了敵方的謀略宣傳和一般人對時局的錯覺，大東亞戰爭中日方的主動優勢與必勝態勢，也因此更加明朗化了。</p>
<p>問：這是從軍事觀點對於印緬新戰局的說明，然則臼印軍隊對印發動攻勢以來的實祭情形叉如何？</p>
<p>答：緬甸方面日本部隊，分三路向印度進軍，第一路於三月八日，協同印度國民軍，對琴丘嶺附近之英印軍展閒攻勢，向國境錢前進；第二路於三月十五日協同印度國民軍在雷馬林附近渡過更的宛河衝過國境綫前進。第三路是日本空軍部隊協同動作，展開對印境的新攻勢。各路勢如破竹，有的離國境僅八十公里，逼近以塔摩機塲爲根據地的敵方重要防綫，有的更已深入印境數十公里。現在日印軍以機械化部隊爲先鋒，沿塔摩及伊姆法爾大道猛烈挺進。</p>
<p>問：據說日印軍這次攻勢，殊出英美當局的意外，因此狼狽不堪，對於他們在整個戰局與國際地位上的影響一定不小吧？</p>
<p>答：怎麼不是呢？據三月廿四日路透社紐約電稱，日軍進攻印度消息，連日刊登於各報極顯著地位。紐約泰晤士保的軍事評論家霍爾德威斷然指出：「軍進攻印度，把握着絕好的機會，無論戰略上政治上，均有充分的確實性。」而紐約的NBC廣播電台也震顫着警吿其國人說：協約軍現已遭逢第二次新加坡之局面，日軍攻印之嚴重性高出一般想像！英國方面，三月二十四日的倫敦泰晤士報亦稱琴丘嶺地區的協約軍有被迫撤退的危險。英美與論這種悲覜的論調。在一個月前是沒有的！</p>
<p>問：日軍這次新攻勢，顯然與協助印度驅逐英美侵略勢力實現獨立有關，請問對印度及重慶的今後局勢有何特殊影響？</p>
<p>答：大東亞戰爭，本爲解放東亞民族之戰。日本對於印度，早會公開宜言，不以印度人爲敵，並對印度民族獨立運動，表示同情與贊助。自由印度臨時政府之成立及印度國民軍之組織，得力於臼本之扶助者最多。現在印度國民軍在臼軍協助下向國境邁進，實踐去年武裝解放印度的宣言，必能更加激化印度國內的民族運動，內外一致爲祖國之解放而向公敵英美侵略者決戰。至於重慶方面，原期反攻緬甸打通滇緬輸血路以挽回頹勢，曾不惜遺派大量遠征軍到緬甸及印度，現在日印軍向印境挺進，則上述計劃叉吿失敗。而且，誠如三月二十七臼紐約NBC廣播電所稱：日軍一旦到達伊姆法爾，則不僅協約軍廣大的兵站綫將遭全部切斷，而通達重慶的新闢公路（渝印公路）亦將完全喪失其價値，共影響如何，由此不難批想。</p>
<h3 id="c2">馬尼布爾平原中重要交通線切斷　伊姆法爾敵軍陷入包圍網 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電據緬甸前綫某基地一日電，伊姆法爾迄哥希馬間之公路，係伊姆法爾一帶敵第四軍團主力之退路，但日印軍已於上月二十八日夜半在烏克魯爾西北方伊姆法爾北方四十公里之密林，將該敵軍退路完全切斷。伊姆法爾通往阿撒密平原之公路有二，一爲由伊姆法爾至哥希馬，一爲由伊姆法爾至西爾其亞，伊姆法爾至西爾其亞之公路，寬四米左石，道路曲折，頗多斜坡，架於溪谷間之橋樑，多係吊橋，運鹼力極受限制，實不堪使用，敵亦未利用該公路，致路面綠草　生。現敵軍專由伊姆法爾至哥希馬之公路，與孟加拉鐵路連絡爲運輸幹綫，今被臼印同盟軍將伊姆法爾。哥希馬間之公路切斷後，敵第四軍幽之運輸綫已斷，其主力部隊已被對鎖於伊姆法爾高地，戰略上已完全孤立。敵第四軍團刻受日軍由各方面猛烈壓迫，已陷入包圍網中，即將陷於總崩潰狀態。</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電據合衆社新德里特派員報吿，東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令部三十一日發表戰報，承認日本密林作戰部隊擴大戰綫約二百餘哩，並突入英印軍之東部印度防縷陣地，馬尼布爾平原中重要之交通錢已被切斷，印度全土聞悉此種消息後，深感衝動，其搖動與不安，今更加甚。據舊金山電台廣播稱：日軍於伊姆法爾北方切斷來多汽車公路後，英印軍見勢不佳，狼狽不堪，傳刻正火速調動援軍前來救援。</p>
<p>里斯本一日中央社電據新德里電傳，英印軍司令官歐慶萊，三十一日在印度中央立法會議席上首次發表稱：梯迭姆已經陷落。</p>
<h3 id="c3">日蘇交涉吿成後兩國關係益強化　以互讓精神得重大收穫 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電關於日。蘇懸案之漁業交涉及移讓樺太利權交涉，現已完全妥結，此在意義上不僅足以證明日。蘇友好關係之强化，同時在戰亂中有關世界各國人士之國際情勢上影極大，此在日本之立場上而言，此次交涉僅爲結東過去之繼續交涉而已，其足以特別强調之意義實少。但漁業，石油兩國利權問題過去已成爲日，蘇間多年之懸案，今見諸解决，此足以證日。蘇兩國之關係係以互讓精神爲基礎，而益趨鞏固。同時，此項懸案得吿解决後，兩國關係已更趨明朗，此實不失爲一重大之收獲。交涉漁業條約時電文曾簽訂日。蘇漁業議定書，規定延長其有效期間五年，而其內容則與過去簽訂之漁業議定書同。至關於移讓權利少决定，就日昭和三年以來，國際情勢之轉變，蘇聯國勢之發展，德。蘇戰爭及大東亞戰爭發生後，日。蘇兩國維持中立關係之意義一舉，能解決日蘇多年之懸案及延長漁業條約期間者，實已鞏固日。蘇關係之基礎。同時足以證明日。蘇中立條約之嚴然存在，其足資安定日。蘇關係者，實極重大。</p>
<h3 id="c4">日蘇兩大懸案圓滿解決經過 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電此次日。蘇兩國已圓滿解决之延畏漁業條約期間及移讓北樺太（按即北庫頁島）兩件重要之外交問題，係自昭和十六年日。蘇中立條約締結以來打破微妙困難之國際政局，而逐漸邁入正軌，此於日。蘇友好關係上實有劃時代之意義，而且關於此次之日。蘇交涉最値注意者，即該兩問題雖有聯帶關係，然於本質上則逈乎不同。同時於所謂確立日蘇友好關係上，其性質實相類似，然事實上却係併行交涉者。關於漁業條約之交涉，於朴茨茅斯條約及日。蘇基地條約之原則上觀之，日本有締結條約之權利，故締結條約之交涉，乃屬當然。爰日。蘇漁業條約自昭和十一年期滿失效後，兩國曾入次締結臨時協定，而本條約之締結交涉，仍繼續進行，蘇聯方面自昭和十四年末之第五次臨時協定以後，即以社文說明締結該項本條約之準備，其間因受國際情勢之影響，故未曾見諸實現。此次交涉之結果，並未締結新漁業條約，在原則上規定將昭和十一年期滿之魯條約再延長五年，而以議定書之形式列記其需要改訂之處，在交換公文中，規定細則。關於日本移讓北樺太權利之交涉，於昭和三年以後，蘇聯政府　於收回蘇聯權利之政策，曾有希望將此收回之暗示，直至昭十六年以後，蘇聯尙未收回者，僅爲北樺太之日本權利。該項權利因根據日蘇基本條約之　定書乙項之規定，故與其他外國權利相異，乃係條約上之權利，故日政府基此而改變過去之態度，至昭和十六年，因日，蘇國交需要調整，而有締結中立條約之勢，是時，兩國政府間遂於原則上成立諒解，此次權利之移讓，乃爲當時預定計劃之實現，當此次交涉開始時，蘇聯會希望將權力問題與漁業問題同時解决，結果兩項交涉遂同時進行，故過去爲兩國國交上最大懸案之以上兩問題，已全部圓滿解决，此乃由於日方態度之公正，以及蘇聯方面面在理論上遵守友好之精神所致。</p>
<h3 id="c5">太是有及煤產額逐漸減少 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電此次日木將在庫頁鳥方面之權利移讓蘇聯，主要者爲石油及開採煤礦，茲誌此兩種事權過去成績如次：石油產額在昭和八年（民股二十二年）為十九萬噸，乃提高記錄，此後逐年減低，至去年僅有一萬六千噸。煤之產　亦然，昭和十年（民國二十四年）產二十四萬噸，是未極高峰。此後漸減至去年僅產五千噸，所以減少之原因，蓋因日在大東亞各地之煤礦基豐，且易採掘，而由於佔領南方地取得油田石油更用之不竭，故此次日本將庫頁島石油，煤礦兩種利權讓予蘇方，對日本實無關痛癢。</p>
<h3 id="c6">襲特魯克敵機　墜毀十三架 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電　南太平洋日軍某基地訊，敵大型轟炸機二十餘架一二九日三次來襲特魯克島，三十日有敵機三十架二次來襲該島，日海軍戰鬥機當即迎戰，擊落B24型敵機三架，繫毀七架，日方地上設施受　極微。又敵小型機十四架，中型機六架，三十日上午來襲波納皮島，經日空軍擊落其三架，臼方無損害。攻數白殘敵，至二十七日下午三時，並對之猛擊，而展開自刃戰，故於印度國民軍激昂之士氣下，敵軍之殲滅指日可待。</p>

<p>里斯本一日中央社電據合衆社倫敦電稱：英陸軍部昨發表謂，緬戰綫之英軍密林作戰部隊司令官聞蓋特少將，最近因乘飛機失事而死亡。其發表因極簡單，對於詳細情形雖難判明，然聞蓋特最近確曾指揮「空中列車「部隊，於北緬戰縷之日軍後方降下，該部隊已被日軍包圍，故開蓋特少將必於彼時陣亡，爲掩飾實情起見，英政府始發表謂因飛機失事。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日海軍省　調整人事 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>東京一日中央社電日海軍省一日下午一時發表如次：任命大阪警備府司令長官海軍中將牧田覺三郎爲舞鶴鎮守府司令長官，任命海電中將大野一郎爲大阪警備府司令長官。又前舞鶴鎭守府司令長官海軍中將大川內傳七，已奉命服務軍令部及海軍省。</p>

<p>仰光一日中央社電日印兩軍刻於印度領內展開大規模作戰，而緬甸國軍此次亦行參加作戰，其使命乃在肪衛緬甸國土，並確保日印同盟軍之兵站綫。敵空輸挺進隊，前曾在加　附近降下，開始蠢動，該方面防衛部隊當即開始行動，率先實行攻擊，現仍積極壓制敵軍。再緬甸國軍克服地勢上之困難，爲防止敵機蠢動，乃在緬甸及海岸全錢要地配置對空監親哨及連絡通下所等，傳期全緬能隨時取得緊密連絡，雖爲防衛部隊，然必要時即可化爲攻擎部隊。此種性格，以面臨孟加拉灣之海岸綫最爲顯著，如某地之防衛攻年將校畢業之某某士官學百名，其中曾留學日本者計七十餘名。</p>

<h3 id="c17">音樂會席上任長演詞 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電四月爲我國首屆海軍節，晚七時，海軍部於國民大會堂舉行慶祝音樂電影大會，海長任援道於席上發表演說如次：</p>
<p>今天是海軍節，民國三十一年四月八日，海軍部召開全國海軍會議於南京，翌年呈請政府，定每年四月一日爲海軍節。今天第一次舉行慶祝典禮。在我最高領袖汪主席閣下領導之下，幷得盟邦海軍之協助，及諸公之熱誠參加，舉行盛會，本人實不勝興奮感謝。中國海軍在前淸不葉，以迄事　發生，數十年來，具有相當之歷史。但國事蜩續，內戰疊起，分崩離析，未能全國統一。所有實力約大別爲長生艦隊，廣東艦隊，渤海艦隊等等。門戶各五，意旨分歧，與海軍建立前途，頗受不良影響。民國三十一年四月一日之全國海軍會議，集南北海軍人員於一堂，打破以前門戶各立，意旨分歧之惡劣障礙，邁進於精誠團結，同甘苦之途，此實可謂</p>
<h3 id="c18">建設新興海軍 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>之　基，亦即今日舉行海軍節祝典之唯一願望。本人回想中國海軍，與辦將七十年，李文忠沈文肅諸前輩，亦盡過不少的努力。而盟邦日本之海軍與辦，亦僅百年，在日本天保九年，即我國道光十入年，日本永戶藩主命其藩士，傚法歐式創造師艦，名日日立丸，譙樓旗幟，堅緻精密。同時閣老阿部伊勢守，亦有做造師艦之命，此爲日本海軍之　矢。嗣於日本永嘉六年，定購荷蘭師船斯母實克號，延請荷蘭敎師傳習海軍。翌年下田口岸之俄艦，適觸礁沉沒，俄人欲新造二船北歸，乃雇用日本工匠，以作助手。造船方法，於以傳之日本。安政三年，已能自造師船，航行近海，安政六年，日木之威臨師船，作第一次</p>
<h3 id="c19">航行美創舉 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>其時直隸幕府之最大師船，日回天·日富士山·回天馬力僅四百　，載重七百十噸。富士山馬力，僅三百五十疋，載重一千噸。文久慶應之間，不斷努力，逐漸設立江戶海軍練習所，神戶海軍學堂，創辦橫濱橫須賀冶鐵廠，開闢小笠原島。凡關於海軍建設，如測量，海防，儀器，槍砲等等之研究與擴充，艱難締造不遺餘力。明治維新，更有一日千里之勢。日俄之戰，遂一擊而破俄國波羅的海艦隊，建世界海戰之奇蹟。今日日本擁有强　雄偉之海軍，乘風破浪於太平洋上，使世界號稱海上新王之英萬，摧枯拉朽，不敢東向</p>
<h3 id="c20">此種大偉精神 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>偉大戰果，茍非朝野一心，將士團結豈能倖致。轉視地大物博之中國海軍，論地域與日本為隣　，論年資與日本爲弟兄，而事事落後，着着失敗，於近睦之隣邦，於先進之弟兄，實覺多所媿對。今日舉行海軍節，特略舉日本之海軍創辦史，以吿吾海軍全體員兵。深望我海軍全體員兵當以盟邦日本建設海軍之傳統精神，奉爲圭呆，急起直追，　加奮勉，愈加團結。以完成中國新海軍之使命，而蘄求大東亞聖戰之必勝。</p>

<p>淮海省中央儲備銀行券之流通狀態，自停發中國聯合準備銀行新劵以來，頗為順利。主要都市，殆以中儲票進行交換，國府當局乃根據旣定方針，定於四月十日起，載至廿日止，以中儲劵百元，對聯銀劵十八圓之比率，將該省內聯銀券全部交換爲中儲券。該交換全部完畢後，即自五月一日起，該省中央稅地方稅等公稅，及公共事業公司之一切收款，限定爲中儲券，而不眾認聯銀券。又金融機關（包括銀行錢莊郵局）之聯銀券存款及貸放款，亦以中儲券百元對聯銀券十八圓之比率，改爲中儲券。其他一般聯銀券之債權債務，亦以該項比率改爲中儲券之債權債務。至於華北華中間，中儲券與聯銀券之匯兌行市，由華中華北兩當局之協力，决定維持中儲券百元對聯銀券十入圓之比率。淮海省地區流通貨幣，經今次措置結果，以中儲券統一，希一般僑民體國府當局意圖，所有聯銀券，悉數交換中儲券，而爲協力，是所至盼。</p>

<h3 id="c31">日蘇關係的新意義 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— 卜道隣</p>
<p>昨天世界各報登載日蘇間成立漁業條約延長五年，及北庫頁石油煤炭權利移讓，業已分別簽署　定書的消息。</p>
<p>對於不斷希望日蘇關係惡化，日蘇發生衝突的各國，對這消息，却是世界外交史上千眞萬確的事實。回顧過去，特別是大東亞戰爭開始以來，關於日蘇兩國間的關係，世界各地早已製造，各種含有惡意的蜚語，散布種種無稽的流言。可是日蘇兩國一直遵守一九四一年四立條約的精神，兩國間的和平關係絲亳未曾動搖，此種關係，由於這次議定書的成立，更得了實質的內容，自當益見擊固。這在美國，的確是一件不痛快的事，而從東亞安定的觀點說實有重大的意義。</p>
<p>更就這次大東亞戰爭發生以夾的日蘇關係以觀，兩國當局的冷靜頭腦和道義態度。實不知粉碎了多少次企圖挑撥兩國關係的謀略。這襄略舉幾幾個實例：</p>
<p>我們知道，一九四二年五月末，蘇聯外交人民委員長墓洛托夫，曾經先後訪問倫敦和華盛頓，與英國締結了期限二十年的同盟條約，和美國簽訂了美蘇經濟協定。化名了「勃拉溫」，悄悄前去白宮的莫洛托夫，羅斯福允許年給價値三十億元的物資援助時，要求什麼代價酬答呢？這是誰都　想像得出的。當時，太平洋方面遭遇日本以强大的武力痛擊的美國，爲了報復起見，　在四月裹「以香格里拉爲基地」，用僅少的幾架轟炸機，空襲日本，但慘遭敗北。對於有了這樣的經騐的美國，蘇聯的濱海省和堪察加有什麼意味，不言自明。然在莫洛托夫出發之前，蘇聯眞理報却於四月十三日日蘇中立倏約成立一週年時，發表一篇很可注目的論文。該文盛構日蘇中立條約對於和平的意義，强調日蘇間的關係極應依照此條約的規定。這是很有趣味的一例？</p>
<p>用蘇聯幾百萬民衆築成對抗强大的德軍的長城，以圖維持並擴大自己帝國主義的世界支配權的美國，爲了太平洋上的戰爭，竟想蘇聯人民流更多的血！這種一味想佔別人便宜的希望，當然是要落空的。</p>
<p>其次，一九四三年十月，蘇美英三國的外交巨頭曾在莫斯科舉行會談。在這次會談之前，蘇聯著名的半月刋「戰爭和勞動階級」嘗論及日蘇中立倏約，闡明應該予以尊重的理由。其後，希望斯太林參加的開羅會議，也不過是羅邱蔣三人的夢想；而斯氏出席的德黑關會談，渝蔣却被摒之會外。但討論的問題倒遠比開辟會談的現實些。</p>
<p>對於此會，英美在新聞上也大吹大擂，說什麼由於英美確約在歐洲開闢第二戰綫，蘇聯亦將提供東方的軍事基地給美國，作為酬報。但是，這種「爵士音樂」絡被「戰爭和勞動階級」所奏的現實的世界政策進行曲完全壓倒騎着蘇聯這頭大熊而想向自己所望的方向進行的美國佬和約翰牛，現在已完全失去駕御大熊的力量了，不得已祗有在它的背上戰戰兢競地凝視熊的步武。這就是今日的實際情形！至於緊緊抱住美國佬一條腿的重慶，不必說，更是怕得了不得啦。</p>
<p>排除一切陰謀挑撥而嚴守着中立條約的蘇聯和日本，秉承締結該約時的諒解，和開羅會議，德黑蘭會談平行，繼續進行交涉，終於有了今日的結果。關於此項交涉，蘇聯政府機關報消息報說：「這些協定的成立，是蘇聯外交穩當性的證明，同時也表明太平洋方面各盟國已有了相互的諒解」。</p>
<p>由此以觀，亞洲的北邊是愈益明朗化了。亞洲北邊的明朗化對於日本之敵有什麼意義呢？這在目前想必已不用再說了</p>

<h3 id="c43">革新上海的先聲 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>上海是全國的經濟，文化重心，除了首都以外，也是政治的重心，政治經濟文化的良　，足以領導全國各地發生影響作用。所以，我們一貫主張，上海應做成政治的模範區，同時，做成中日合作的模範區。最近，我們曾三度申論上海革新的必要性及其步驟。我們更認爲達成這目的的先决條件，是在健全人事。</p>
<p>很足欣幸的，上月底，市府任命吳頌皋氏擔任第一區公署長，現在又任吳氏爲市府秘審畏，同時，熊劍東氏擔任保安處長兼淸鄕事務局高長。這是市府健全人事的第一聲。市府能够貫激用人唯才的方針，則上海革新前途，光明在握，我們站在市民的立塲，非常欣慰，而且對市長十分感激。</p>
<p>吳頌皋氏是近十年中國外交界傑出人才，有眞實學問，品行端方，操守廉潔。待人親誠，治事精細，有組織力，有計劃力。在革新上海的過程中，吳氏是理想的佐理市畏人才，過去在第一區公署成立及一入兩區合併時期，頗爲努力，頗具成績。</p>
<p>熊劍東氏是中國現代軍人的典型，有現代軍事學識。品行端正，治事　實苦幹。有遠大抱負，富於責任心。上海是後方基地，治安非常重要，熊氏負此重任，必能促成治安力量一元化，極足欣幸。</p>
<p>政府有了健全的人才，必有好的政績，定可預卜。市民現已寄以極大的期待，自當予以最大的支援。不過，人事健全是需要整個的，所以，盼望進一步對於各局人事，也應由上至下，登用專家。其次，財政公開，整理稅收，健全市府經濟力量，提高公務員待遇。</p>
<p>最後，必須承認過去市府與市民之間的隔閡，是最大缺點，今後應與民間發生密切聯繋，所以，民意機關的從速建立，實為刻不容緩之舉，以市府與市民打成一片的力量，共同革新上海，建設新上海。</p>

<p>中華日報問：「肥皂火柴導久未配給，原因何在？報載將自五月份起實行綜合配給辦法，將來是否即由指定之一家統售各種配給物品？」</p>
<p>第一區公署經濟處：答「第四期戶口火柴，各指定零售店業已領到派貨，可於下週內發售。第四期戶口肥皂，不久亦將配給。此期火柴肥皂，均因調整售價，故稍延時日。自五月份起施用之新式聯票配給證，各種配給物品之零賣處，給與同樣號碼，係以居戶鄰近之食米零賣處號碼爲標準，俾該居戶亦可於鄰近其他配給物零賣處購得各種配給物，惟並非指定一家商店　售之。」</p>
<h3 id="c56">夜間警防問題 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>中華日報新中國報問：「本市實施永久燈火管制，對於省燈雖在積極改善，惟最近發生之事故，多係不良份子，假借檢查名義積行不法，不知警務當局，有何特別對策否？」</p>
<p>第一察局答：「自三月三日實施戰時燈火管制以來，一般不良份子乘機於黑夜中作種種不法行爲，致市民惑覺不安。本局有關於斯，續極將街燈予以改善，業將全部完成。關於驚防方而，本局業已飭令所屬各分局，一體　　辦理如左；　須與友邦軍憲警務等有關各機關保持密切連絡，共同協力維持地方秩序，並强化治安。　各分局以增强夜問之警　力爲目的，於必要時得將盡間動務人員，轉用於夜間。　分局長以下谷分局幹部，應不分盡夜，傾其全力，勵行强化外勤督察。　飭令各分局，盡量利用保甲自　區之組織，而充夜間警察警備力之不足。</p>
<p>此外並強化外勤督察，努力於不良警察官之摘刻盡量協助警察當局，以期戰時燈火管制中，警防任務之完整，而使市民得以安居樂業。</p>
<p>又第二警察局答：「查南市地方自經戰事以後，居民大半遷徙，較大營業迄未恢復，各處被　房屋亦少建築，沿民國路及中華路路燈，華中水電公司因材斜關係，雖經極力設法，迄未普遍裝設，前南市各娛樂塲所存在時，雖經裝有路燈，亦不過接近娛樂塲一段而已，現已停止，故南市治安每日由下午六時以後，即加派巡邏畏警，並由特務隊分佈要衢，至檢查行人向由各分局巡日率領長警實施，並不單派便衣，故假借名　，續行不法之事件，尙未發生。</p>

<p>第二警察局答：「查南市路燈稀少，因舉中水一電公司材料關係，迄未普遍裝設，對於防空減光，刻正計劃進行。一面勸吿沿街商號實行減光，照常營業，其里弄自設之路燈，亦勸其改裝防空燈。至於治安方面，自鐵門開放，娛樂塲停止，誠恐發生不幸事件，故對於南市三分局警力，增調長警一百餘名，分佈耍衢，俾資保護夜間行人。」</p>

<p>— 楊錦兆</p>
<p>自從棉布收買，巿上停購，最感困苦的是一，低微薪給階級·成人罷，舊的能穿，　的縫補，暫時還能渡過當　的難關，至於幼嬰或兒童的衣着，就成了嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>一個新生的嬰兒，假使他的母親有着豐富的奶汁，「吃飽」無憂。說到着暖，依據傳統的習慣，本可以用舊衣類改成嬰衣抱裙，尿布等，比較的軟熱適體·但是，處於　急環境中，做父母的自己穿舊縫補不暇，還忍心大料改小料嗎？於是祇得草率從事的做成嬰衣，布料的貧乏和合適嬰體與否？就擱置一旁。近來常常看見拋在馬路上死亡的幼嬰，難保其中沒有凍斃的·希望主持　統會諸公，為下一代國民，為未來的主人翁着想，無論棉布配給前後，設法新生幼嬰的特種配給，迎接我們的新人，便利貧困的家長和可憐的孩子們。這種敢　新生幼嬰及兒童的棉布配給，提出幾點小　見：</p>
<p>新生幼嬰的棉布配給，除必需衣料外，抱裙，尿布等，亦應　算入內，以足敷需要為止。兒童方面　年齡分為幾期，酌最其長短大小，配給布料若干。某年齡內，以正常發育之兒童身長腰圍為標準。</p>
<p>兒童不是成人，是身心正在　續發展中的小天使。所以配給　布的質料，柔軟為宜。不妨碍發育，適應自然的生長。其次，兒童的個性是好動的，配給布要力求堅牢，才比較耐穿，又因為活動的結果，棉布的顏色可擇色澤傑，耐汚垢的一種。</p>

<p>天空海闊　（四）</p>
<p>頗偶鸛。　錢海，到旅　，到馬公，到面雄等，作內地的航行巡體一直　織到九月中句。然後就改為　渡重洋的航行，但在露洋航行的前兩個月，候補生們全都得練習能慣於艦上的生活，以及海洋的生活。</p>
<p>就是關於這一點，也令人回憶起兵學校生活的好處。艦內生活的一切模型，是在江田島學到的。星期六大掃除，星期一大檢閱，全都是千篇一律。只是眞人等，不僅受業於敎官，而且把所學的，命令水兵們去實行。　為了使他們每個人都能　當起個人的實任來</p>
<p>內的候補生們，全沒當作學生看待，也更未當作客人看待。他們的工作雖然分為値班部，和操作部，然而前者與下級士官毫無二致。從配屬，航海士，砲術士等等工作一　至甲板士官的工作，都要接次序一一地記牢。從什麽起至什麽止的工作實行後，才能像離開巢窩的小鳥一樣，羽毛究全而可以自立了。</p>
<p>話雖然如此說，然而命令起水兵來，仍然沒有充分的膽量。部下固然是部下，但對方總算是</p>
<p>「立正！」雖然這樣發號令，但因為不是從丹田中發出的聲音，所以，反而自己倒不能不立正注意了。縱令不帶氣力的號令，然而他們仍然是嚴肅和整齊　服從·只有這樣紀律嚴明的模範兵，才能派到練習　隊上來服務，這一點，或許大部份候補生從未注意過。</p>
<p>開始勤務和操作時，才感覺到在江田島所學習的，都立刻有用，眞使眞人等驚奇不置。</p>
<p>只有測天這一點，在兵學校所學者，是一種陸地上的水而練習。在軍艦上是動搖的，與校園的地面那樣固定不動，是逈乎不同的。</p>
<p>用六分儀來對　太陽，也已經不是一舉手一投足的容易事了。至於夜間的瑩瑩小星，則艦縱或輕微的搖擺，也像飛鳥一樣，在六分儀的視野裏逃掉。</p>
<p>費了九牛二虎之力，好容易把它對準，然后把幾點分幾秒的，高度規定為幾度幾分幾秒，再反復地轉動三四次，才能得出一個平均來。藉此來知道軍艦的位置，然而這種計算，是非常難作的。在未熟練的期間，縱或花費三小時，仍還有錯誤。</p>
<p>眞人對於發號施令雖然沒有把握，但對於測天，卻是出乎其類拔乎其萃。對準天體旣巧而精，且對於計算也是非常迅速。自從二中學生時代以來，特長的數學就可以證明這一點。一小時左右的工夫，他的操作完畢，而他的面孔上透露出</p>
<p>「谷，你這個傢伙，到氣象台去服務吧！」其他候補生，帶着煩腦的口胞駡他。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>看見過黃色而混濁的海洋。也看見過南洋入口處的深藍色的碧海。也看見過上海旅順的戰跡，以及奇特的台灣風景。從　商人的汽水味，四人一屋的汗臭味，也全都嗅慣了。至於軍艦中發見很多老鼠和蟑螂蟲，也不大驚小怪了。</p>
<p>「對於一般的狂風暴雨，現在也不怕了。」同屋的中野候補生，裝着老船客的樣子說了。</p>
<p>「胡說八道！還沒有遇見過一次厲害的哪！」加藤候補生給他了一個當頭反駁。雖然正是海上巨風季候，然而他們眞是幸運，在中國海上竟</p>
<p>「甚至老手水兵，也有時候嬰嘔吐呵！」岡山候補生因為業己有過一兩次暈船的經騐，才這樣說。</p>
<p>「豈有此理？暈與不暈，歸根結底不過是心定與否而已。」中野像揮動着竹刀的樣十這樣說。</p>
<p>「不，那是一種生理現象。總而言之，沒有好的辦法，非慣不可。」</p>
<p>岡山雖然這樣很安靜地說過去，但中野却不」服氣最後，加藤便大聲嚷起來。</p>
<p>「中野　！我吿訴你吧！進行遠航的時候，你會哭的。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Advancing into India <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Shan</p>
<p>Q: Recently, all eyes have been focused on the India-Burma war situation. What is the actual significance?</p>
<p>A: Before observing the India-Burma war situation, we must pay special attention to three points: First, in the near future, due to the continued advancement of the Soviet offensive, general military observers believe that the United States and Britain may transfer their war efforts from Europe to the Pacific; second, the US air and naval forces once carried out surprise attacks on the Marshall and Caroline Islands, and some mistakenly believed that Japan would be forced to adopt a defensive posture as a result; third, the joint efforts of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing in military activities in Burma were exaggerated by the enemy as a counteroffensive against Burma. From these three points, people inevitably have various speculations. The fact that the Japanese army, together with the Indian National Army, is advancing towards the Indian border thoroughly shattered the enemy's strategic propaganda and the general public's illusions about the current situation. The Japanese side's initiative, advantage, and certainty of victory in the Greater East Asia War are therefore even more clarified.</p>
<p>Q: This is an explanation of the new India-Burma war situation from a military perspective. So, what is the actual situation since the Japanese-Indian troops launched an offensive against India?</p>
<p>A: The Japanese troops in Burma are advancing into India in three routes. The first route, on March 8th, together with the Indian National Army, launched an offensive against the British-Indian army near the Chin Hills and advanced towards the border. The second route, on March 15th, together with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Remalin and rushed across the border. The third route is the Japanese Air Force cooperating to launch a new offensive against India. Each route is advancing rapidly. Some are only 80 kilometers away from the border, approaching the enemy's important defense line based on the Tamu airport, and some have penetrated dozens of kilometers into India. Currently, the Japanese-Indian army is using mechanized units as the vanguard, advancing fiercely along the Tamu and Imphal roads.</p>
<p>Q: It is said that this offensive by the Japanese-Indian army came as a surprise to the British and American authorities, resulting in extreme disarray. It must have a significant impact on their overall war situation and international position, right?</p>
<p>A: How could it not? According to a Reuters dispatch from New York on March 24th, news of the Japanese army's attack on India has been published in a prominent position in newspapers for days. The New York Times' military commentator, Holdridge, stated decisively: "The army's attack on India has seized an excellent opportunity, with full certainty both strategically and politically." The NBC radio station in New York also trembled, warning its countrymen: the Allied forces have now encountered a situation similar to the second Singapore, and the seriousness of the Japanese army's attack on India is beyond general imagination! In Britain, the London Times also stated on March 24th that the Allied forces in the Chin Hills area are in danger of being forced to retreat. This kind of pessimistic tone in British and American public opinion did not exist a month ago!</p>
<p>Q: This new offensive by the Japanese army is clearly related to helping India drive out the British and American invading forces and realize independence. What special impact will it have on the future situation in India and Chongqing?</p>
<p>A: The Greater East Asia War was originally a war to liberate the East Asian nations. Japan has long made a public declaration that it does not regard the Indian people as enemies, and expresses sympathy and support for the Indian national independence movement. The establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India and the organization of the Indian National Army owe the most to Japan's support. Now, the Indian National Army, with the assistance of the Japanese army, is advancing towards the border, fulfilling the declaration of armed liberation of India last year. This will surely intensify the national movement within India, uniting both internally and externally to wage a decisive battle against the common enemy, the British and American invaders, for the liberation of the motherland. As for Chongqing, they originally hoped to counterattack Burma and open the Burma Road to transport supplies and reverse the decline. They did not hesitate to send a large number of expeditionary forces to Burma and India. Now, the Japanese-Indian army is advancing into India, and the aforementioned plan has failed again. Moreover, as the New York NBC radio station stated on March 27th: Once the Japanese army reaches Imphal, not only will the Allied forces' extensive supply lines be completely cut off, but also the newly opened highway to Chongqing (the Chongqing-India Highway) will completely lose its value. It is not difficult to imagine the impact of this.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Important Transportation Lines in the Manipur Plain Cut Off; Enemy Troops in Imphal Ensnared in a Net <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain base on the Burma front on the 1st reports that the highway between Imphal and Kohima is the retreat route for the main force of the enemy's 4th Army Corps in the Imphal area, but on the night of the 28th of last month, in the dense forest 40 kilometers north of Imphal, northwest of Ukhrul, the Japanese-Indian army completely cut off the enemy's retreat route. There are two highways connecting Imphal to the Assam Plain: one from Imphal to Kohima, and the other from Imphal to Silchar. The highway from Imphal to Silchar is four meters wide, with winding roads and many slopes. The bridges built over the valleys are mostly suspension bridges, and the transportation capacity is extremely limited, making it impractical to use. The enemy has not utilized this highway, resulting in the road surface being overgrown with grass. Currently, the enemy army relies solely on the highway from Imphal to Kohima, which connects to the Bengal Railway as the main transportation line. Now that the highway between Imphal and Kohima has been cut off by the Japanese-Indian allied forces, the enemy's 4th Army Corps' transportation line has been severed, and its main force has been locked on the Imphal Highlands, strategically completely isolated. The enemy's 4th Army Corps is currently under fierce pressure from the Japanese army from all directions and has fallen into an encirclement, and is about to collapse completely.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – A United Press dispatch from a special correspondent in New Delhi reports that the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Forces Command announced a war report on the 31st, admitting that the Japanese jungle warfare units have expanded their battle lines by approximately 200 miles and broken into the British-Indian army's eastern Indian defensive positions. Important transportation routes in the Manipur Plain have been cut off. The news of this has deeply shaken and unsettled the entire land of India. According to a broadcast from the San Francisco radio station, after the Japanese army cut off the Ledo Road north of Imphal, the British-Indian army, seeing the situation deteriorating, was in a state of panic and was reportedly hastily mobilizing reinforcements to come to their rescue.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union Strengthen After Successful Negotiations; Significant Gains Made in a Spirit of Mutual Concession <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The fishery negotiations and the transfer of Sakhalin rights negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union have now been completely concluded. In terms of significance, this not only proves the strengthening of friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, but also has a significant impact on the international situation for people from all countries involved in the war. From Japan's standpoint, these negotiations are merely a continuation of past negotiations, and there is little significance to be particularly emphasized. However, the fishery and oil rights issues have been a long-standing issue between Japan and the Soviet Union for many years. Now that they have been resolved, this proves that the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union is based on a spirit of mutual concession and is becoming more and more consolidated. At the same time, with the resolution of these outstanding issues, relations between the two countries have become clearer, which is indeed a major gain. When negotiating the fishery treaty, a Japan-Soviet fishery protocol was signed, stipulating that its validity period be extended for five years, and its content is the same as the fishery protocol signed in the past. As for the decision on the transfer of rights, in light of the changes in the international situation since Showa 3 (1928), the development of Soviet power, the German-Soviet war, and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the significance of maintaining neutral relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is that being able to resolve the long-standing issues between Japan and the Soviet Union and extend the term of the fishery treaty has consolidated the foundation of Japan-Soviet relations. At the same time, it is sufficient to prove the strict existence of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact, which is of great significance in stabilizing Japan-Soviet relations.</p>
<h3 id="e4">The Complete Course of the Satisfactory Resolution of the Two Major Outstanding Issues Between Japan and the Soviet Union <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – The extension of the fishery treaty period and the transfer of rights in northern Sakhalin (i.e., northern Karafuto), two important diplomatic issues that have now been satisfactorily resolved between Japan and the Soviet Union, have gradually moved onto the right track since the conclusion of the Japan-Soviet Neutrality Pact in Showa 16 (1941), breaking through subtle and difficult international political situations. This has epoch-making significance in Japan-Soviet friendly relations. Moreover, what is most noteworthy about the current Japan-Soviet negotiations is that although the two issues are related, they are essentially different. At the same time, in terms of establishing friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union, their nature is similar, but in fact they are negotiated in parallel. Regarding the negotiations on the fishery treaty, from the principles of the Treaty of Portsmouth and the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty, Japan has the right to conclude a treaty, so negotiating the conclusion of a treaty is a matter of course. Therefore, after the expiration of the Japan-Soviet Fishery Treaty in Showa 11 (1936), the two countries entered into a temporary agreement, and negotiations on the conclusion of this treaty continued. Since the fifth temporary agreement at the end of Showa 14 (1939), the Soviet Union has issued a social statement explaining the preparations for concluding this treaty, but it has not been realized due to the influence of the international situation. As a result of the current negotiations, a new fishery treaty was not concluded. In principle, it was stipulated that the Lu Treaty, which expired in Showa 11 (1936), would be extended for another five years, and the points that needed to be revised were listed in the form of a protocol. The details were stipulated in the exchange of official documents. Regarding the negotiations on Japan's transfer of rights in northern Sakhalin, since Showa 3 (1928), the Soviet government, in its policy of recovering Soviet rights, had hinted at the hope of recovering this. Until Showa 16 (1941), the only Japanese rights in northern Sakhalin that the Soviet Union had not recovered were these. These rights were different from other foreign rights because they were based on the provision in Item B of the Protocol to the Japan-Soviet Basic Treaty. They were treaty rights. Therefore, the Japanese government changed its past attitude based on this. In Showa 16 (1941), due to the need for Japan-Soviet diplomatic relations to be adjusted, there was a trend towards the conclusion of a neutrality treaty. At that time, the two governments reached a consensus in principle. The transfer of these rights was the realization of the planned scheme at that time. When the current negotiations began, the Soviet Union hoped to resolve the power issue and the fishery issue at the same time. As a result, the two negotiations proceeded simultaneously. Therefore, the above two issues, which were the biggest outstanding issues in the past in the diplomatic relations between the two countries, have been completely and satisfactorily resolved. This is due to the impartiality of the Japanese side's attitude and the Soviet Union's adherence to the spirit of friendship in theory.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Output of Oil and Coal Gradually Decreasing <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) – This time, Japan is transferring its rights in the Sakhalin Islands to the Soviet Union, mainly oil and coal mining. The past performance of these two undertakings is recorded as follows: In Showa 8 (1933), the oil production was 190,000 tons, which was the highest record. After that, it decreased year by year, and only 16,000 tons last year. The coal production was also the same. In Showa 10 (1935), the production was 240,000 tons, which was the highest peak. After that, it gradually decreased to only 5,000 tons last year. The reason for the decrease is that Japan has abundant coal mines in various parts of the Greater East Asia and they are easy to mine. Moreover, due to the occupation of the southern territories and the acquisition of oil fields, the oil is inexhaustible. Therefore, Japan's transfer of the oil and coal rights in the Sakhalin Islands to the Soviet Union is actually of no concern to Japan.</p>

The Japanese naval fighters immediately met them and shot down three B-24 type enemy planes and destroyed seven. The damage to the Japanese ground facilities was minimal. In addition, 14 enemy small planes and 6 medium planes attacked Ponape Island on the morning of the 30th. The Japanese air force shot down three of them, and the Japanese side suffered no damage. The attack on several hundred remaining enemies, until 3:00 pm on the 27th, and launched a fierce attack on them,展开自刃战, Therefore, under the rising morale of the Indian National Army, the annihilation of the enemy army is just around the corner.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – A United Press dispatch from London reports that the British War Office announced yesterday that Brigadier General Wingate, commander of the British army jungle warfare units on the Burma front, recently died in a plane crash. The announcement was extremely simple, and it is difficult to determine the details, but Wingate recently commanded the "Air Train" units to land behind the Japanese army on the northern Burma battlefield. These units have been surrounded by the Japanese army, so it is certain that Brigadier General Wingate died at that time. In order to cover up the truth, the British government announced that it was due to a plane crash.</p>

<p>Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese and Indian armies are currently engaged in large-scale operations within Indian territory, and the Burmese National Army is also participating in these operations. Their mission is to defend Burmese territory and secure the supply lines for the Japanese-Indian allied forces. Enemy airborne commando units previously landed near Kalewa and began to stir up trouble. The defense units in that area immediately began to take action and took the lead in launching attacks, and are still actively suppressing the enemy forces. Furthermore, the Burmese National Army has overcome geographical difficulties to prevent enemy aircraft from stirring up trouble. They have deployed anti-aircraft surveillance posts and communication outposts in key areas along the entire Burmese coastline, hoping to achieve close contact throughout Burma at any time. Although they are defense units, they can be transformed into offensive units when necessary. This characteristic is most evident on the coastline facing the Bay of Bengal. For example, in a certain place, the defense officer is a graduate of the annual military academy, and 70 of the 100 non-commissioned officers have studied in Japan.</p>

In this battle, the enemy abandoned 60 corpses, 20 were captured, and the spoils of war included 19 mortars, 2 heavy machine guns, and many other weapons. Later, they urgently pursued the defeated enemy in the areas on both sides of the Imphal Highway, and at a height 20 kilometers northeast of Imphal, they surrounded</p>

<p>The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 2:00 pm on March 21st: Japanese troops in Burma, in cooperation with the Indian National Army, launched an attack on the British-Indian army near the Chin Hills on March 8th and are currently engaged in annihilation battles near the border. Another powerful Japanese unit, along with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Homalin on March 15th and are currently advancing towards the Burma-India border.</p>
<p>The elite of the Japanese forces stationed in Burma annihilated the British-Indian 7th Division on the Buiteton front in early March. The enemy hastily shifted its forces and began to provide assistance to that area. In the midst of fierce battles between the two sides, one part of the Japanese forces, in cooperation with the Indian National Army, took the opportunity to attack the British-Indian army in the Chin Hills area of the central Burma-India border and almost completely annihilated them. Another powerful unit, along with the Indian National Army, crossed the Gander River near Homalin (about 200 kilometers north of Donzai) in the north and rushed directly into the enemy's rear, beginning an attack towards the Burma-India border.</p>

<p>In the previous Arakan campaign, the Japanese army suddenly launched a surprise attack operation against the main force of the Han-Indian army in the Chin Hills on March 8th. In cooperation with the Indian National Army, they quickly cut off the enemy's retreat route. After four days of fighting, they completely surrounded the main force of the British-Indian 17th Division (about 10,000 men from two brigades, 48 and 63) in Donzai, their key point. Since the morning of the 14th, they have launched a magnificent annihilation battle integrating land and air.</p>
<p>The British-Indian 23rd Division north of Mindatmi also collapsed before the elite Japanese troops. A part of the Indian National Army and the Japanese vanguard, with the force of wind sweeping away fallen leaves, crossed the Gander River and launched an attack into India. In this annihilation battle, the enemy was caught off guard due to the skillful strategy of the Japanese army at the beginning of the operation, and the entire army collapsed.</p>
<p>The Burma-India border, from the northern Yunnan border to the coast of the Bay of Bengal in the south, is entirely composed of steep mountains, with elevations ranging from 7,000 to 8,000 meters. There are many hardwoods and lush bamboo forests. The enemy, who built fortifications on the mountaintops, resisted stubbornly relying on the natural barriers. However, the elite Japanese troops overcame all the difficulties in replenishing ammunition and water and achieved the results of the annihilation battle. The battles on the Burma-India border have now reached their climax. The elite Japanese troops and the Indian National Army are cooperating closely and advancing on Delhi.

<p>Central News Agency, Beijing – Today (the 1st) is the first Navy Day in our country. All naval bases and units across the country will hold grand celebration ceremonies. At the Navy Department, the ceremony will be held at 10:00 am in the Department's auditorium. A tea party will be held at 11:00 am. From 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, naval students and soldiers will parade in the city. At 7:30 pm, a lecture, music, and film convention will be held in the National Assembly Hall. It is learned that in order to expand publicity and promote a deep understanding of the navy among the people, the department has printed commemorative booklets and propaganda slogans, which will be distributed to various agencies and posted on major thoroughfares. The following are recorded: China has a vast territorial sea and must have a strong navy. With a navy, there is command of the sea. A new China should build a new navy. The navy is an essential element of national defense strength. Building a navy is the implementation of national policy. Consolidate our defenses through military buildup. Rely on each other, and strive to advance together with the navies of our allies. To complete the defensive power in the Pacific, the Chinese and Japanese navies should cooperate to take responsibility. Maintaining the security of our territorial waters is the sole responsibility of our navy. Let us all work together to build our maritime Great Wall. Celebrate Navy Day and always commemorate the revival of the navy. Long live the Republic of China, long live the new navy.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) – April is the first Navy Day in our country. At 7:00 pm, the Navy Department held a celebration music and film convention in the National Assembly Hall. Navy Commander Ren Yuandao delivered a speech at the meeting as follows:</p>
<p>Today is Navy Day. On April 8, 1942, the Navy Department convened a National Naval Conference in Nanjing. The following year, it requested the government to designate April 1st of each year as Navy Day. Today is the first time we are holding a celebration ceremony. Under the leadership of our Supreme Leader Chairman Wang, and with the assistance of the Allied Navies, and the enthusiastic participation of all of you, we are holding a grand gathering. I am truly excited and grateful. The Chinese Navy has a considerable history of several decades, from the late Qing Dynasty to the occurrence of incidents. However, the country was in turmoil, with internal wars breaking out one after another, causing division and disintegration, and failing to achieve national unity. All the strength was roughly divided into the Changsheng Fleet, the Guangdong Fleet, the Bohai Fleet, etc. Each had its own interests and divergent views, which had a negative impact on the future development of the Navy. The National Naval Conference on April 1, 1942, brought naval personnel from the north and south together, breaking the previous bad obstacles of separate interests and divergent views, and advancing on the path of sincere unity and shared hardships. This can truly be said to be</p>
<h3 id="e18">Building a New Navy <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The foundation for the event, and also the sole wish for holding today's Navy Day celebration. When I think back to the Chinese Navy, which has been running for nearly 70 years, the predecessors such as Li Wenzhong and Shen Wensu have also made a lot of efforts. However, the navy of our ally Japan has only been running for 100 years. In the ninth year of Tenpo in Japan, which was the 18th year of Daoguang in our country, the Lord of the Togo Domain ordered his retainers to emulate the European style and create a ship, named the "Hitachi Maru," with watchtowers, flags, and a solid and precise structure. At the same time, Grand Secretary Abe Ise-no-kami also had the order to build a ship. This was the beginning of the Japanese Navy. Subsequently, in the sixth year of Yongjia in Japan, the Dutch ship "Sumisu" was purchased, and Dutch teachers were invited to teach naval skills. The following year, a Russian ship in the Port of Shimoda happened to run aground and sink. The Russians wanted to build two new ships to return to the north, so they hired Japanese craftsmen to help them. Shipbuilding methods were transmitted to Japan through this. By the third year of Ansei, they were able to build ships themselves and sail in nearby waters. In the sixth year of Ansei, Japan's intimidating ships made their first</p>
<h3 id="e19">A Groundbreaking Feat in Navigation by Japan <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>At that time, the largest vessel in the Zhili Viceroy's fleet, the "Kaiten," and the "Fuji-san," had a meager horsepower of only 400, with a carrying capacity of 710 tons. The "Fuji-san" had a horsepower of only 350, with a carrying capacity of 1,000 tons. Between the years of Bunkyu and Keio (1861-1868), tireless efforts were made, gradually establishing the Edo Naval Training Center, the Kobe Naval Academy, founding the Yokohama and Yokosuka Ironworks, and developing the Ogasawara Islands. Regarding naval construction, research, and expansion in areas such as surveying, coastal defense, instruments, and artillery, no effort was spared in the arduous process of creation. After the Meiji Restoration, progress accelerated rapidly. In the Russo-Japanese War, they shattered the Russian Baltic Fleet with a single blow, establishing a miracle in world naval warfare. Today, Japan possesses a powerful and magnificent navy, sailing through the Pacific Ocean, causing the naval prowess of Britain, once known as the "King of the Sea," to wither and crumble, afraid to look eastward.</p>
<h3 id="e20">This Great Spirit <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Such great victories could not have been achieved without the unity of the court and the people, and the solidarity of the officers and soldiers. In contrast, consider the Chinese navy, blessed with vast lands and abundant resources. Geographically, it is a neighbor to Japan; chronologically, it is a brother to Japan. Yet, in everything, it lags behind and fails repeatedly. Towards its close neighbor and advanced brother, it truly feels a great sense of shame. Today, as we celebrate Navy Day, we briefly recount the history of the founding of the Japanese navy to inform all officers and soldiers of our navy. We deeply hope that all officers and soldiers of our navy will take the traditional spirit of our allied nation, Japan, in building their navy as a guiding principle, strive to catch up quickly, be even more diligent, and even more united, to fulfill the mission of China's new navy and pray for the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia Holy War.</p>

<p>The circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in Huaihai Province has been quite smooth since the cessation of the issuance of new notes by the United Reserve Bank of China. In major cities, exchange is mostly conducted using Central Reserve notes. The National Government, based on its established policy, has decided to exchange all United Reserve Bank notes within the province for Central Reserve notes at a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes, from April 10th to the 20th. After the complete exchange, starting from May 1st, all public taxes, including central and local taxes, and all receipts from public utility companies in the province will be limited to Central Reserve notes, and United Reserve notes will no longer be accepted. Furthermore, United Reserve notes deposits and loans in financial institutions (including banks, money shops, and post offices) will also be converted to Central Reserve notes at a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes. Other general United Reserve notes debts and claims will also be converted to Central Reserve notes debts and claims at the same rate. As for the exchange rate between Central Reserve notes and United Reserve notes in North China and Central China, the authorities in Central China and North China will cooperate to maintain a rate of 18 yuan of United Reserve notes for 100 yuan of Central Reserve notes. As a result of this measure, the currency circulating in the Huaihai Province region will be unified with Central Reserve notes. It is hoped that the general overseas Chinese will understand the intentions of the National Government and exchange all their United Reserve notes for Central Reserve notes to cooperate.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Minister Chen Chunpu took office at the Ministry of Construction, he has attached great importance to the work of protecting traffic routes.

<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Expeditionary Army to China announced the war situation for the week on the 31st as follows: The Japanese Army Air Force continues to carry out proactive operations to preemptively strike the enemy, posing a great threat to the enemy's air force. On the 24th, it launched a surprise attack on the Jian'ou and Yushan airfields, and on the 27th, it attacked the Jian'ou airfield again, destroying its runways and thwarting the enemy's plans. Although the airfield had been subjected to intense bombing by our air force more than 50 times in the past, on the 29th, the enemy used several P40 and P41 aircraft to attack the Nanchang area, but they were intercepted by the Japanese air force, one of which was shot down, and the others fled.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Ministry of Finance, considering that the method for transporting banknotes has been in effect since its promulgation on March 1st of last year, and is no longer fully suited to the current situation, recently revised it and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. It has been learned that the original method stipulated that those transporting new legal tender in amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan could apply for a passport and pay a passport fee of 10 yuan. The revision now stipulates that those transporting 100,000 yuan or more can apply for a passport and pay a passport fee of 20 yuan and a stamp duty of 2 yuan.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The implementation of issuing residence permits by police agencies in various provinces and cities will soon reach its third year. In the past, due to different situations in North China and Guangdong provinces, there were regulations for travel permits when people traveled. Recently, considering that the security in various places has gradually become consolidated, the Central Government, for the convenience of the people, has consulted with the Allied authorities. With the cooperation of the Allies, a unified method has been realized. After April 1st, people with residence permits may travel freely. However, in North China and Guangdong, people traveling must exchange for new residence permits. This new permit will be handled according to the methods of the Ministry of Interior, so that it gradually aligns with the Central Government. In order to adapt to the wartime system, all third-country nationals residing in China should have legal identity documents from their own country. If they travel from their place of residence, they must still obtain a travel permit. From now on, people's travel will be more convenient, and the effectiveness of residence permits will also tend to be unified.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to unify the currency system and expand the circulation area of Central Reserve Notes, the authorities have previously decided to further adjust the currency system of Huai'an Province. Since January 1st, the new issuance of United Reserve Bank Notes in the area has been stopped, and it has been stipulated that all treasury expenditures and bank payments, etc., will be limited to Central Reserve Notes. Now, in order to fully implement the unified circulation of Central Reserve Notes, the Central Reserve Bank offices in various important areas of the province will conduct a full exchange of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes from April 10th to the 20th. Minister Zhou and the Japanese Embassy have issued statements as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e30">Statement by Minister Zhou <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the adjustment of the currency system in Huai'an Province, the government has gradually implemented it in accordance with its established policy. Since the joint use of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Bank Notes began on December 1st of last year, financial circulation and material regulation in the province have become more convenient. On February 21st of this year, the Xuzhou branch of the Central Reserve Bank officially opened. In order to adapt to the needs of the environment, further adjustments have been made. That is, starting from March 1st of this year, the new issuance of notes by the United Reserve Bank of China in Huai'an Province will be stopped. All treasury expenditures and bank deposits, loans, remittances, and other payments in Huai'an Province will no longer use United Reserve Notes and will be limited to Central Reserve Notes. Now that Central Reserve Bank offices have been widely established in important areas of the province, it has been decided that from April 10th to the 20th of this year, a full exchange of Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Notes will be implemented in Huai'an Province. The methods are as follows: Central Reserve Notes and United Reserve Notes will be exchanged at a rate of 100 yuan to 18 yuan. The detailed methods of exchange and the establishment of exchange offices will be planned and implemented by the Finance Department of the Huai'an Provincial Government and the Central Reserve Bank. After the full exchange period, all United Reserve Bank of China notes that have been used in Huai'an Province should be restricted according to the following methods: Starting from May 1st, 1944, all receipts and expenditures of central and local agencies and state-owned enterprises in Huai'an Province will be in Central Reserve Notes and will no longer use United Reserve Notes. Financial institutions (including banks, money shops, post offices, etc.) in Huai'an Province, whose deposits and loans were originally in United Reserve Notes, should be converted to Central Reserve Notes at a rate of 18 yuan to 100 yuan. General debts and claims originally contracted in United Reserve Notes should also be handled in accordance with the above method. All our national affairs officials</p>
<h3 id="e31">New Significance of Japanese-Soviet Relations <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Daolin</p>
<p>Yesterday, newspapers around the world reported that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to extend the fisheries treaty for five years and to transfer the rights to oil and coal in northern Sakhalin has been signed separately.</p>
<p>For countries that constantly hope for the deterioration of Japanese-Soviet relations and the outbreak of conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union, this news is a true fact in the history of world diplomacy. Looking back, especially since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, various malicious rumors have been fabricated and all kinds of unfounded rumors have been spread around the world regarding the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. However, Japan and the Soviet Union have always adhered to the spirit of the treaty signed in April 1941, and the peaceful relations between the two countries have not been shaken in the slightest. This relationship has gained substantial content due to the establishment of this protocol and should naturally become more solid. This is indeed an unpleasant thing for the United States, but it has important significance from the perspective of East Asian stability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, considering the Japanese-Soviet relations since the outbreak of this Greater East Asia War, the calm minds and moral attitude of the authorities of the two countries have shattered countless plots attempting to provoke relations between the two countries. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>We know that in late May 1942, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited London and Washington successively, concluding a twenty-year alliance treaty with the United Kingdom and signing a US-Soviet economic agreement with the United States. Molotov, using the alias "Bravin," secretly went to the White House. When Roosevelt agreed to provide material assistance worth 3 billion yuan annually, what price did he ask for in return? This is something everyone can imagine. At that time, the United States, which was suffering a strong military defeat from Japan in the Pacific, in order to retaliate, "using Shangri-La as a base" in April, launched an air raid on Japan with only a few bombers, but suffered a disastrous defeat. For the United States, which had such experience, the Soviet Maritime Province and Kamchatka had obvious meaning. However, before Molotov's departure, the Soviet newspaper Pravda published a remarkable article on April 13, the anniversary of the establishment of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty. The article praised the significance of the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty for peace and emphasized that the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union should be strictly in accordance with the provisions of this treaty. This is a very interesting example.</p>
<p>The United States, which used millions of Soviet people to build a Great Wall to resist the powerful German army in order to maintain and expand its imperialist world domination, actually wanted the Soviet people to shed more blood for the war in the Pacific! This hope of simply taking advantage of others is, of course, doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Secondly, in October 1943, the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom held talks in Moscow. Before this meeting, the well-known Soviet bi-monthly magazine "War and the Working Class" discussed the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Treaty and clarified the reasons why it should be respected. Later, the Cairo Conference, which hoped for Stalin's participation, was just a dream of Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang; and at the Tehran Conference attended by Stalin, Yu Chiang was excluded. But the issues discussed were more realistic than those of the Cairo Conference.</p>
<p>Regarding this meeting, the British and Americans also exaggerated in the news, saying that due to the British and American assurances to open a second front in Europe, the Soviet Union would also provide military bases in the East to the United States as a reward. However, this "jazz music" was completely overwhelmed by the reality of the world policy march played by "War and the Working Class." The American and John Bull who wanted to ride on the Soviet bear and proceed in the direction they wanted have now completely lost the power to control the bear, and have no choice but to look at the bear's steps on its back in fear. This is the actual situation today! As for Chongqing, which is clinging to the leg of the American, it is, of course, extremely afraid.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union and Japan, which excluded all conspiracies of provocation and strictly adhered to the Neutrality Treaty, continued negotiations in parallel with the Cairo Conference and the Tehran Conference, in accordance with the understanding reached at the time of the signing of the treaty, and finally had the results of today. Regarding this negotiation, the Soviet government organ newspaper Izvestia said: "The establishment of these agreements is proof of the stability of Soviet diplomacy, and it also shows that the Allies in the Pacific have reached mutual understanding."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the northern border of Asia is becoming increasingly clear. What does the clarification of the northern border of Asia mean for Japan's enemies? It is probably unnecessary to say more at present.</p>

<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Precursor to Shanghai's Innovation <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the entire country, and besides the capital, it is also a political center. Its superior politics, economy, and culture are sufficient to lead and influence various regions of the country. Therefore, we have consistently advocated that Shanghai should become a model area for politics and a model area for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Recently, we have discussed the necessity and steps of Shanghai's innovation three times. We also believe that the prerequisite for achieving this goal is to improve personnel.</p>
<p>It is very gratifying that at the end of last month, the municipal government appointed Mr. Wu Songgao as the head of the First District Office, and now Mr. Wu has also been appointed as a secretary of the municipal government. At the same time, Mr. Xiong Jiandong has been appointed as the head of the Security Department and the head of the Qingxiang Affairs Bureau. This is the first sound of the municipal government's efforts to improve personnel. If the municipal government can thoroughly implement the policy of employing people based on their talents, then the future of Shanghai's innovation is promising. We, standing in the position of the citizens, are very pleased and grateful to the mayor.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Songgao is an outstanding talent in China's diplomatic circles in the past ten years. He has real knowledge, upright character, and integrity. He is kind and sincere to others, meticulous in handling affairs, and has organizational and planning skills. In the process of innovating Shanghai, Mr. Wu is an ideal talent to assist the mayor. In the past, he worked hard and achieved considerable results in the establishment of the First District Office and the merger of the two districts.</p>
<p>Mr. Xiong Jiandong is a typical modern Chinese soldier with modern military knowledge. He has an upright character and works hard and practically. He has great ambitions and a strong sense of responsibility. Shanghai is a rear base, and public security is very important. Mr. Xiong's assumption of this important task will surely promote the unification of security forces, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>With sound talents in the government, there will surely be good political achievements, which can be predicted. The citizens now have high expectations and should give the greatest support. However, the improvement of personnel needs to be comprehensive. Therefore, it is hoped that experts will be employed from top to bottom for the personnel of various bureaus. Secondly, financial transparency, streamlining tax collection, strengthening the economic strength of the municipal government, and improving the treatment of civil servants are needed.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be admitted that the biggest shortcoming in the past was the gap between the municipal government and the citizens. In the future, close ties should be established with the people. Therefore, the prompt establishment of a public opinion organ is an urgent task, so that the municipal government and the citizens can work together to innovate Shanghai and build a new Shanghai.</p>

<p>The banks and firms in the silver industry, recognizing that bill acceptance and discount are the main businesses of the financial industry and can make market funds circulate in an orderly manner, have universally implemented the implementation measures established by the silver industry. For example, they have signed acceptance bill discount contracts with the Flour and Wheat Industry Committee and the Grain Control Committee, abolishing fixed-term credit loans and credit overdrafts. Since the trial implementation, it has been quite effective. It is heard that they have decided to further promote it in the future, each contacting and imitating the wheat discount acceptance method and striving to promote it on their own. It is stipulated that all industries may sign a contract with the bank to entrust the bank to accept bills and a bill discount contract, divided into mortgage and credit, for legitimate business needs such as purchasing raw materials. Regarding the issue of the Central Reserve Bank focusing on bill discounts, an agreement has been reached to accept it. Therefore, in addition to being used to adjust positions among various banks and firms, the bills can also be applied to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount. The accepted and discounted bills are divided into bank acceptance bills, commercial acceptance bills, and commercial promissory notes in two types, A and B. As for the discount rate, it is particularly low to encourage it.</p>

<p>The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to protect the rights and interests of policyholders and promote the sound development of the domestic insurance industry, has ordered all insurance companies to increase their capital. The share capital of each company must be increased to 3 million yuan, and it has consulted with the Shanghai West District Office of the Central Reserve Bank of China to collect the payments on its behalf. The shareholders of each insurance company shall pay the increased share capital in cash as the standard. It is heard that the payment method is: Each insurance company shall print a three-part payment slip, one for notification, one for bank receipt, and one for record. After each company pays the increased capital to the bank, the bank shall issue a certificate, and the company shall request the Insurance Supervision Bureau to verify the capital with the certificate. The Insurance Supervision Bureau shall use the bank certificate as a verification document and forward it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for the issuance of a license. The bank shall first issue a certificate to the companies that pay the capital in full first, and the Insurance Supervision Bureau and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce shall also issue licenses accordingly first. It is heard that there are about 90 insurance companies in Shanghai, and the total amount of funds to be increased is about 20 million yuan.</p>

<p>The Municipal Propaganda Office held the 11th regular press conference at the Municipal Government yesterday. The questions raised by reporters from various newspapers and the answers from various agencies are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e55">Matches to be Distributed Next Week <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>China Daily asked: "Why have soap and matches not been distributed for a long time? It is reported that a comprehensive distribution method will be implemented from May. In the future, will all allocated items be sold by one designated store?"</p>
<p>Economic Office of the First District Office replied: "The fourth-period household matches have already been received by the designated retail stores and will be sold within next week. The fourth-period household soaps will also be distributed soon. Both matches and soaps of this period have been delayed due to price adjustments. The retail outlets for various allocated items using the new joint-ticket distribution certificates to be implemented from May will be given the same number, based on the number of the retail rice outlet near the residence, so that the residents can also purchase various allocated items at the retail outlets near their residences. However, it does not designate one store to sell them all."</p>
<h3 id="e56">Nighttime Security Issues <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>China Daily and New China Daily asked: "The city has implemented permanent light control. Although the provincial government is actively improving the street lights, recent incidents are mostly caused by unscrupulous elements taking advantage of the inspection name to accumulate illegal actions. Does the police authority have any special countermeasures?"</p>
<p>The First Police Bureau replied: "Since the implementation of wartime light control on March 3, some unscrupulous elements have taken the opportunity to commit various illegal acts in the dark, causing citizens to feel uneasy. The Bureau has been actively improving the street lights, and the entire project will soon be completed. Regarding the security aspect, the Bureau has already ordered all subordinate branches to handle it in the following ways: 1. Maintain close contact with relevant agencies such as military police and police of friendly nations, jointly maintain local order, and strengthen public security. 2. Each branch shall increase police presence at night. If necessary, it may transfer staff who work during the day to work at night. 3. All branch chiefs and branch cadres below shall devote their full efforts, day and night, to strengthen on-duty supervision. 4. Order each branch to make full use of the self-defense organization of Baojia District to supplement the lack of nighttime police force.</p>
<p>In addition, strengthen on-duty supervision, and strive to dismiss corrupt police officers. Do your best to assist the police authorities in order to complete the security tasks during wartime light control, so that citizens can live and work in peace.</p>
<p>The Second Police Bureau also replied: "Since the war, most of the residents in the Nanshi area have moved out, and large-scale businesses have not yet recovered. Few of the houses that were destroyed have been rebuilt. The China Water and Electricity Company has not been able to universally install street lights along the Minguo Road and Zhonghua Road due to material reasons. Although there were street lights installed near the entertainment venues in Nanshi when they existed, they were only near that section. Now that they have been closed, the security in Nanshi is reinforced with patrol police every day from 6:00 PM. Special teams are distributed in key areas to check pedestrians, led by branch patrol officers, and not just plainclothes police. Therefore, incidents of taking advantage of the name to carry out illegal activities have not yet occurred."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Nanshi Air Defense Street Lights <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Pingbao asked: "Since the city has implemented permanent light control, there is very little activity at night. The First District Office has increased the reduced street lights. The Nanshi area has very few street lights. Now they have all been turned off, making it very dark at night, which is worrying for public security. Will the air defense street lights be installed in that area?"</p>
<p>The Second Police Bureau replied: "The reason why there are few street lights in Nanshi is due to the China Water and Electricity Company's material issues, which have not been universally installed. The plan for air defense dimming is currently underway. On the one hand, we are advising businesses along the street to implement dimming and continue to operate as usual. For the street lights set up in the alleys, we are also advising them to convert them into air defense lights. As for the security aspect, since the iron gates were opened and the entertainment venues were closed, we are afraid that unfortunate incidents will occur. Therefore, we have increased the police force in the Nanshi Third Branch by more than 100 officers, distributing them in key areas to protect pedestrians at night."</p>

<p>Pingbao and Xinwenbao asked: "The garbage in Nanshi is still piled up as before. As the weather gets warmer, the cleanliness of the streets is related to the health of the residents. I hope the authorities will express their practical plans for the future."</p>
<p>The Health Bureau replied: "The Health Bureau is currently ordering the Nanshi District Health Office to actively find ways to clear the accumulated garbage in Nanshi."</p>

<h3 id="e60">Talking about the Cotton Cloth Rationing for Infants and Children <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Jinzhao</p>
<p>Since the government's purchase of cotton cloth, sales in the market have stopped. The most difficult situation is faced by those in the low-salary class. Adults can still get by temporarily by wearing old clothes and mending them. However, the clothing for infants or children has become a serious problem.</p>
<p>For a newborn infant, if his mother has plenty of milk, he will not have to worry about "being fed." Speaking of warmth, according to traditional customs, old clothes can be used to make baby clothes, swaddling clothes, diapers, etc., which are relatively soft and warm. However, in the current urgent environment, can parents bear to change large pieces of old cloth into small ones when they are busy sewing and mending their own clothes? Therefore, they can only hastily make baby clothes, putting aside the lack of cloth and whether it is suitable for the baby's body. Recently, I often see dead infants abandoned on the road. It is difficult to guarantee that some of them have not frozen to death. I hope that the officials in charge of the unification association will think about the next generation of citizens and the future masters of the country. Whether before or after cotton cloth rationing, they should try to set up special rations for newborn infants, welcome our new people, and facilitate poor parents and pitiful children. I would like to offer a few suggestions regarding this cotton cloth rationing for newborn infants and children:</p>
<p>The cotton cloth rationing for newborn infants should include not only essential clothing, but also swaddling clothes, diapers, etc., in order to meet their needs. Children should be divided into several age groups, and the amount of cloth rationed should be based on their height and size. Within a certain age range, the height and waist circumference of normally developing children should be used as the standard.</p>
<p>Children are not adults; they are little angels whose bodies and minds are continuously developing. Therefore, the material of the rationed cloth should be soft. It should not hinder development and should adapt to natural growth. Secondly, children are naturally active. The rationed cloth should be strong and durable. Also, because of their activity, the color of the cotton cloth should be dirt-resistant.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Navy <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Yu, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sky and Sea (4)</p>
<p>I rather unfortunately joined. From Shanghai to Ryojun, to Makung, to Miemo, etc., the inland navigation patrols continued until mid-September. Then it was changed to a navigation that crossed the ocean. However, in the two months before the voyage across the ocean, the candidates had to practice getting used to life on the ship and life at sea.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, it reminds one of the benefits of life at the naval academy. Everything in the ship's life was learned at Etajima. Saturday's cleaning and Monday's inspection were all the same. However, the real people not only learned from the instructors, but also ordered the sailors to implement what they had learned in order to make each of them capable of taking on their own responsibilities.</p>
<p>The candidates in the group were not regarded as students, let alone guests. Although their work was divided into the watchkeeping department and the operations department, the former was no different from the junior officers. From the work of the adjutant, the navigator, the artillery officer, etc., to the work of the deck officer, they had to memorize everything in order. After completing the work from beginning to end, they could be independent like little birds leaving the nest.</p>
<p>Having said that, they still did not have enough courage to order the sailors. The subordinates were subordinates, but the other party was always a senior.</p>
<p>"Attention!" Although they gave such orders, because the sound did not come from the dantian, they could not help but pay attention to themselves. Even if the orders were given without vigor, they were still serious and obeyed neatly. Only such disciplined model soldiers could be assigned to serve on the training team. This point may not have been noticed by most of the candidates.</p>
<p>When they started duty and operations, they felt that what they had learned at Etajima was immediately useful, which really surprised them.</p>
<p>Only the point of surveying the sky was something that was practiced on land at the naval academy. On warships, it was swaying, and it was vastly different from the fixed ground of the campus.</p>
<p>Using a sextant to align with the sun was no longer an easy task. As for the faint stars at night, even a slight sway of the ship would cause them to escape from the field of view of the sextant like flying birds.</p>
<p>After spending a lot of effort to align with it, they would then specify the height to a few degrees, a few minutes, and a few seconds at a few minutes and seconds. They would then repeatedly turn it three or four times to obtain an average. They would then use this to know the position of the warship. However, this calculation was very difficult to do. During the period of unfamiliarity, even if they spent three hours, there would still be errors.</p>
<p>Although the real person was not confident in issuing orders, he was outstanding in surveying the sky. He was skillful and precise in aligning with celestial bodies, and he was also very quick with calculations. This could be proven by his special mathematics since his days as a second middle school student. His operation was completed in about an hour, and his face revealed</p>
<p>"Gu, you fellow, go to the weather station to serve!" The other candidates cursed him with troubled mouths.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>I have seen the yellow and turbid ocean. I have also seen the deep blue sea at the entrance to the South Seas. I have also seen the battlefields of Shanghai and Ryojun, as well as the unique scenery of Taiwan. I have also become accustomed to the soda taste of the merchants, the sweaty smell of four people in a room. As for finding many rats and cockroaches on warships, I am not surprised.</p>
<p>"I am not afraid of ordinary storms now," said the candidate Nakano, who lived in the same room, pretending to be an old sea traveler.</p>
<p>"Nonsense! You haven't encountered a serious one yet!" Candidate Kato gave him a head-on rebuttal. Although it was the season of giant storms at sea, they were really lucky.</p>
<p>"Even veteran sailors sometimes vomit!" Candidate Okayama said this because he had already experienced seasickness once or twice.</p>
<p>"That's ridiculous? Whether you are seasick or not, it all comes down to whether you are calm or not," Nakano said, waving a bamboo sword.</p>
<p>"No, it's a physiological phenomenon. In short, there is no good way, you have to get used to it."</p>
<p>Although Okayama said this quietly, Nakano was not convinced. Finally, Kato shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"Nakano! I'm telling you! When you go on a long voyage, you'll cry."</p>
<h3 id="e62">Hospital Doctors Respond to Providing Free Medical Care <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The National Medical Clinic at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Mahou Road is a joint clinic of traditional Chinese medicine that has a good reputation for its achievements. It also provides free medical care and medicine without charging any fees. It is open every day from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM. All poor patients are welcome to come to the clinic for diagnosis and medication. It is particularly good at treating various internal medicine ailments. Dr. Chen Zhichao is specially appointed to be in charge of the free clinic, and Mr. Xin Anzhai is in charge of the free medicine. This is held all year round. In addition, because the number of people in Shanghai suffering from hemorrhoids and anal fistulas is increasing, and fistulas often lead to tuberculosis, free examinations of various anal diseases are offered every morning. In order to benefit the poor, Chen Jinong, a traditional Chinese medicine physician specializing in internal medicine, has specially increased the number of free consultations. Free tickets are issued by this clinic. The limit is ten people every morning from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The clinic is located at 46 Marang Road, telephone 88448. The Zhonghua Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic at 12 Liucun Street, Jiucang Street, Laobeimen, Nanshi, aims to provide free medical care and medicine to help the poor. In view of the rampant epidemics in Shanghai recently, the people of the clinic have specially set up free injections of meningitis vaccine and vaccinations every day from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, starting from today. Citizens are welcome to go for free vaccinations. Dr. Guan Suishuang's clinic at 4 Shengbao Lane, Wenjianshi Road, will offer free vaccinations for one month starting from today. Poor people can go completely free of charge, without the need for an introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Free Enrollment in Vocational Training Classes <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>This office has entrusted the China United Middle School to administer vocational training classes. The subjects are commercial arithmetic, bookkeeping, applied foreign languages, etc., with a duration of three months. The enrollment quota is fifty students, both male and female. Anyone who has graduated from high school or has equivalent academic ability, is over eighteen years of age, of high moral character, and in good health may bring their credentials and two recent one-inch half-length photos to register at the social services department of this newspaper or at the China United Middle School on the sixth floor of the Kenye Building on Beijing Road. The examination date is scheduled to begin at 4:30 PM on March 31st. Due to the spring holiday and the vast area of this city, it is feared that aspiring young people may not be fully informed and miss this good opportunity. It has been decided to hold another examination on the afternoon of April 7th, and the start date of classes will be postponed to April 10th. Admitted students will not be charged tuition or miscellaneous fees, only a deposit of two hundred yuan (which will be refunded upon completion of the program). The class time will remain from 5:40 PM to 7:30 PM daily (except Sundays). Prospectuses are available upon request.</p>
<p>Lectures This office, together with the Morality Society and the Confucius Sage Society, will jointly hold a morality lecture at the Cangzhou Shuchang from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM today. Teacher Li Mingxue and lecturer Lu Buruyu, director of the Youzhu Hospital, will speak on human justice and public health. Middle school and university students who read this newspaper are welcome to attend.</p>
<p>Confucius Worship The China Confucius Sage Society is scheduled to hold a grand ceremony of Confucius worship at 3:00 PM on April 5th (Qingming Festival) at the Shandong Guild Hall Auditorium, located at the intersection of the old Lufan Road, Ximen Road, and the Shandong Hall.
