<h3>敬悼古賀元帥</h3>
<p>咋日日本大本營發表，聯合艦隊司令官古賀元帥於三月間乘機指揮前綫作戰時殉職·噩耗傳來，不勝哀悼。</p>
<p>古賀元師是日本海軍名將，去年五月繼山本元帥任聯合艦隊司令，不僅繼任職務，更繼承忠勇遺志，復追隨山本元帥壯烈殉國，在個人生命上，雖屬不幸，而在日本海軍的忠勇精神上，則可充分表現「視死如歸」之氣概。軍人原以殉身疆塲，引爲光榮，所以，古賀元帥誠已「功成身殉，俯仰無怍」了。</p>
<p>我們認識日本海軍經數十年之訓練，已培養成萬衆一心，忠勇爲國的傳統精神，古賀元帥之殉職，更足激起日本全體海軍將士的同仇敵愾之心，爲大東亞戰爭而奮勇殲敵。</p>
<p>我們讀了日本大本營報道部長及駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐等之談話以後，益知古賀元帥生前功動與忠勇精神，實爲不可磨滅之實光。我們於敬致哀悼以外，盼望古賀元帥之精神，永垂不朽，永爲大東亞各國軍人的楷模。</p>
<h3>挽救煤荒</h3>
<p>目前上海工業生產的萎縮，我們會一再指出，認爲是增產聲中最矛盾的現象。檢討工業生產所以萎縮的原因，主要者是勁力與原料兩點。茲就動力問題加以申論。</p>
<p>動力的來源是煤斤，因爲上海存煤不豐，運輸又感困難，所以，電力公司當局屢次希望用戶撙節用電，並限制使用度數。這是消極的措置。積極的治標之法，還是要疏通煤斤來源，不斷輸運，使電力供應無處匱乏。</p>
<p>誠然，在此戰時，實踐節約生活，限制用電，節省煤斤，用之於戰爭需要，自屬天經地義。可是，生產事業的用電，有裨於戰爭，有利於民生者，使之儘可能撙節，使之不浪費則可。而使之减低生產能率，使之無法生產則絕對不可。因此，電力公司因煤斤短缺而减少供電，支配上應老慮公允與合理。所謂合理者，是辨明消耗性與生產性之區分，辨別對於戰爭與民生利益之輕重，而規定若者應减？若者不應减？若者應减至某種程度？如果不依合理標準而普遍限制，則生產事業效能低落，就是戰爭上，民生上的利益遭受影響。</p>
<p>我們一面希望電力當局重視支配的合理。同時，希望史積極的從疏運煤斤着想。况且，煤斤短缺，不僅影嚮電力供應，尤其影響民生燃料。所以疏巡煤斤，實爲調整戰時生產，保障民生燃料的當前急務。不過，我們也知道疏運煤斤有兩個根本問題，一是煤斤產量的問題，二是運輸能力的問題，目前這兩問題實際上與平時確有不同，所以，我們主張：</p>
<p>工廠用電，必須先行做成詳細分類，譬如某種工廠生產戰時軍需或民生用品者，應充分供給電力；某種工廠生產非民生用品或消耗品者，應减少至最小限度或停止給供。以上種類的決定，應由主管機關早爲核定。其次，醫院以及文化公益團體等用電，應斟酌實際需要予以寬放。民間用電則應再度極力减少，尤其在電燈火下打通夜麻將者，均應予以警告或停止供給。</p>
<p>民生燃料用煤，其重要性不亞於食糧，目前每月製造煤球，作爲戶口配給，但實際上不敷甚鉅，希望當局充分加撥煤斤，一方面嚴密監醫製造數量，防止從中作弊，澈底消滅黑市價格。</p>
<p>至於煤斤來源，有人主張開發華中煤礦及整理舊礦，固然是治本之道，但需時頗久，實有遠水不能救近火之感。我們認爲靑島海州兩地之煤南運較爲便捷。運輸途徑，不外水陸兩道，水道方面則雇用大批木製帆船，從海道或運河南運。陸運方面，火車規定一星期內停止載客一二天，或减少載客，賸出車輛，專運煤斤。</p>
<p>煤斤缺乏，無論在工業生產上，民生燃料上，均爲極嚴得的問題，盼望工商界有識之士，共同商討組織運輸機構，雇用木船，協助當局從事裝運·同時，希望各有關當局注意及之，彼此取得聯繫，從速會商整個具體辦法，一致策進，挽救上海的煤荒，亦即實現增加生產，加强戰力。</p>

<h3>栗原部長談話</h3>
<p>東京五日中央社電　日大本營海軍報道部長栗原悅藏大佐，頃就聯合艦隊司令長官古賀峯一大將殉職事發表談話如次：古賀聯合艦隊司令長官，本年三月於乘機指揮前綫作戰中而殉職之訊，業經大本營於五日下午發表，天皇陛下鑒於古賀聯合艦隊長官，於生前會樹赫赫偉動，特賜以元帥稱號，准列入元帥府，叙功一級，授旭日桐花大援章，誠　榮耀之至·溯自客歲四月元師繼任聯合艦隊長官以來，即不避危險，躬親進出前錢，指揮聯合艦隊將兵奮戰，故有今次之殉職。元帥在任時，戰局日趨激烈，最近元帥更以最高指揮官責任之重大，常日以繼夜，克盡辛勞，發揮日帝國海軍之傳統精神，統率全軍奮戰。目下戰局推移，正値國家興亡之秋，不期有此不測事件發生，固屬憾事，今次全海軍以新任司令長官豐田大將爲核心，於御稜威下更昂揚鬥志，向擊減敵人之途邁進，繼承山本。吉賀兩元帥之精神，繼續奮戰，以報國家。</p>

<h3>松島部長讚揚　古賀元帥功績</h3>
<p>中央社滬訊　日大本營昨發表日聯合艦隊司令長官古賀海軍大將殉職消息，此爲日本爲保衛大東亞之再度重大犧牲，深予東亞十倍民衆以莫大衝動。日駐華艦隊報道部長松島大佐，特於五日發表談話，盛讃古賀長官囚擊司時並披歷日本海軍行將越益奮勇滅敵之決意，其要旨如次：</p>
<p>五月五日，日本大本長官古賀峯一大將殉職消息，古賀長官身負聯合艦隊最高指揮官之軍大任務，而於前綫機上殉國，誠不勝痛惜之至。古賀長官來，在此一年之中，紫堅在日本每每戰當時，東鄕提督曾數次經幕僚懇請，登入司令塔內，然東鄕提督每次　稱：「余老矣，唯君等爲將來之日木起見，可登又司令塔內，好自爲之」。始終站立於槍林彈雨之船橋上，絕不稍動，茲山本元帥之戰死，並古賀長官之殉職，實亦俱爲日本海軍傳統精神之發掦，此與敵將麥克沃塞當在新幾內亞登陸之際，於巡洋艦內從事指揮而大事宣傳者，誠不可同日而語。昔東亞兵法家孫子曾稱：「置於死地而後勝」，日本之各提督誠係孫子兵法之實踐者，古賀提督首創一種戰史上向所未有之戰術，此即聯合國方面極感恐怖，稱之爲「邀擊戰術」者。古賀提督之邀擊戰術，究已擊滅若干聯合軍兵士於太平洋，或使聯合軍兵士在各島叢林之中流去若于鮮血，此當爲聯合軍兵士所深悉，去年五月阿圖島山崎部隊曾擊滅聯合軍一萬五千名，又在吉爾貝特群島之馬金。泰拉瓦二島約使三萬美軍爲之流血。此外，在瓜　廉納爾島，所羅門羣島，波根維爾島，新不列顛島，新愛爾爾島，新幾內亞方面美軍之犧牲均爲歷史上向所來有之重大·海上方面，亦歷經龍加空戰，庫拉灣夜戰，科倫班加拉夜戰，波根維爾島空戰五次，吉爾貝特島空戰四次及馬紹爾羣島空戰諸役，先後擊沉戰艦四艘，航空母艦二十艘，巡洋艦二十六艘，驅逐艦二十九艘，特務艦一艘，潛水艇三十艘，魚雷艇十五艘，艇種不明者六艘，戰艦或巡洋艦一艘，巡洋艦或大型驅遂艦七艘，舟艇二百艘，輪送船一百九十艘。又擊毀戰艦四艘。航空母艦七艘，巡洋艦三十艘，驅逐艦十九艘，魚雷艇七艘，艦種不明者二艘，戰艦或巡洋艦二艘，巡洋艦八艘，舟艇八十二艘，驅潛艇三艘。擊落飛機約三千架以上，敵海空人員約戰死二十萬名，此可證明古賀長官邀擊戰術之輝煌成果。聯合艦隊司令長官一職，茲已由豐田提督繼任，全艦隊士氣益見旺盛，現正伺機以待，決覆滅在太平洋布陣之美軍事勢力。</p>
<h3>滿刷新警政</h3>
<p>新京五日中央社電　滿洲國政府爲刷新警政，曾制定警政刷新整備要綱，要點如次：　機構簡素化，　此階級制度與明確階級之職務權限。　警察人員之重點，配置於其中。尤堪注目者，即特置重點於警察官之素質向上。至其具體辦法，今後對執行警政之主力，特以警官爲中心，而謀再度編成警察體制。按滿洲建國以來之警察體制，係專注意於武力方面，而今次之刷新，係田武力警察轉爲智能警察，故對其今後活動，益堪期待。</p>
<h3>土亟須準備　應付危機　外長發表談話</h3>
<p>安加拉五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：土耳其外長曼奈門卓格　頃向記者發表談話稱，吾人刻正生存於危險時代，而於危機未消除前，吾人之日常生活必須適應環境經常準備，實爲急務，蓋一且果被迫決戰以保護國家權益，吾人亦無須發生驚慌也。外長於論及防空措置時宜稱，吾人不可忽略司能之危險，否則必招致嚴重之後果。</p>
<h3>蘇聯發行　鉅額公債</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：據塔斯社報告稱，蘇聯政府頃已決定發行第三次戰時公債，其數爲二十五萬萬盧布，同時並發表宣言，籲請民衆協力，據謂此次公債之發行，實予民衆以顯示愛護黨國之機會。</p>
<h3>駐西英使返國</h3>
<p>瑪德里五日中央社電　海通社訊：英大使　爾偕其夫人，昨乘飛機　此，經里斯本囘國述職。</p>
<h3>伊姆法爾攻防戰激烈　南綫英軍陸續後退中</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　印度前綫電，伊姆法爾日，英雙方之攻防戰，最近愈形激烈，日軍於空軍協力下，漸向前進。今巴列爾之陷落已迫目前，同時，馬尼波爾戰局亦臨最後階段，目前伊姆法爾。哥希馬間之敵軍，爲挽回頹勢，猶作困獸之鬥，並增援大量坦克車，大砲及空軍，期從事殊死之防禦，然無論如何，敵軍根據地伊姆法爾已爲日印軍所控制，故彼等雖欲重整底鼓，亦僅成强弩之末。</p>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　華盛頓消息：美陸長史汀生四日與記者團會見時，曾發表緬甸戰綫之戰况如次：日軍之進攻，最近二週愈趨激烈，各地之激戰，現已形成印度洋至中國境之一大戰錢。據四日錫關島康提路透消息稱：緬印戰綫之戰鬥，可分爲哥希馬巴列爾地區，孟多布其頓公路地區及緬甸北部空輸部隊之戰鬥三方面，反軸心軍於各地痛遭日軍之攻擊。又東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令部四日之公報上亦承認緬甸全面作戰之失敗如次：緬甸南部回孟加拉　之阿恰布，然又歸於失敗，現正陸續後退中。</p>

<p>漢口五日中央社電許昌·鄭州·新鄭·各地佔領河南防衛第一綫之之日軍精銳部隊，自三日夜於京漢綫西側地區，對敗敵更展開以機械化部隊爲主之機動戰、更有陸軍航空機作密切協力，現正到處包圍敵軍，開始凄壯之大殲滅戰。自作戰開始以來，雖時僅二旬，已擊破重慶軍第八十五軍麾下第廿三師暫編第十一師，及暫編第十五軍麾下之暫編第廿七師，新編第廿九師，及第十八軍之新編第四十二師，第十二軍之第廿二師，合計共七師，兵力約六萬。同時幹部指揮官之損失，亦不下一萬五千人，重慶軍爲挽回此頹勢，現在繼續增加兵力於伏牛山脈東部地區，據守堅固陣地抵抗中。活躍於一河南新戰塲中之日軍將兵，現正冒遮天之沙塵，及伏牛山脈之險峽以及種種困難，繼續進擊中。又四日已判明敵軍幹部損傷如次：　陣亡者第八十五軍副軍長張測民，新編第廿九師長呂公良，第百十師長穆金澤。　負傷者第八十五軍吳軍長，　行踪不明者第十一師長蔣當翅。</p>

<h3>渝稅務司易人</h3>
<p>中央社訊　據可靠方面消息，重慶財政部長孔祥熙，最近發表一令，調海關總稅務司，以美人立德爾繼英人瓊利而任海關總稅務司一職。查渝海關總稅務司一職，向由英人充任，此次突易以美人，可見美在渝勢力已逐漸膨脹而壓倒英國。而且英美去歲曾發表取銷不平等條約中，曾表示更調海關總稅務司，而今仍由美人充任，可見英美之所謂取銷不平等條約，實屬欺人之談。</p>
<h3>津抑平物價</h3>
<p>天津五日中央社電　天津市政府鑒於津市物價高漲，影響民生至鉅，爲平抑起見，曾一再實施有效方法，如取締囤積，防止暴利等。頃爲澈底使物價低廉，決勵行明碼制度，並重申前令，令商會通知各業一體實行。</p>
<h3>郭培爾暢論　侵歐成敗關鍵　師以義動哀者必勝</h3>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　德宣傳部長郭培爾博士，於近期「德意志」雜誌上，以「不定因素」爲題發表一文，暢論侵歡戰役之成敗關鍵。大旨略謂，英美進犯歐陸，將過無數難關，而於未來戰局發展具有決定性之各因素如不能確切把握，則對戰爭之最後成敗亦將永無把握。準是而論，如於空戰中不能獲得決定性之勝利，則識敵方之實力，敵亦深知己方之實力。以雙方獲勝之可能性相較，吾人最後勝利之望，固屬確有根據之結論，吾人手握妙算，非至決定關頭，不以示敵。且師以義動，哀者必勝，英美軍人遠涉重洋侵人國土，不過滿足少數財閥之貪慾，非吾人之爲祖國之生存爲大陸之安全而戰，是以吾人瞻望前途，對最後勝利衷心信賴。</p>
<h3>倫敦緊張</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電海通社訊：倫敦每日快報稱，倫敦美人對於侵歐之舉，均大感興奮，倫敦各報紙之編輯部均不斷注意侵歐之言次消息，全國教堂均靜待無綫電發出侵歐信號，即鳴鐘召集人民祈禱。軍事運輸局首腦約翰生上校已籲請所有私人旅行，於侵歐開始時完全停止，因大批傷兵必須運回轉入內地，軍隊及給養則大批運往海港，每節車輛均迫切需用，對於旅行尋樂之人將不加顧慮</p>
<h3>空中攻勢</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓電：陸長史汀生昨在情報席上稱，英美空軍轟炸德國交通網，乃攻歐前夕之集中轟炸，目的在使德國運輸中斷。</p>
<p>柏林五日中央社電　三月以來，英美空軍對德轟炸益趨激烈，此可視爲第二戰綫展開之先聲。連日反軸心軍以飛機三四千架轟炸德軍事設施及都市工塲及交通機關，並其他各軸心國，其所投炸彈宛如暴雨，每小時平均投彈約在五百枚以上，一日一萬二千噸。德軍對此之措置及所蒙損害情形如次：敵機轟炸柏林方法，大別之可分白晝及夜間兩種，其轟炸目的大別之可分純軍事轟炸。奇襲轟炸。生產設施轟炸。運輸要路轟炸等。關於夜間轟炸，每次英美參加飛機約有中型機五百至八百架之多，但每次多因德空軍之邀擊，不能達到目的，故不免陷於盲炸狀態，致柏林市郊住宅區十分之四五已成瓦礫。至於白晝轟炸，或夜間轟炸此數爲少，其飛機大部爲美大型轟炸機，每次約在三百至八百架以上，目的在破壞工塲交通設施，然因飛機損失過多，頗難達到所期目的。</p>
<h3>美陸軍傷亡　現逾十五萬</h3>
<p>里斯本五日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓息：美陸長史汀生昨宣布，美陸軍至四月三十日爲止，在各戰塲共損失一五九·三〇二人。</p>
<h3>章南特調任　駐蘇大使</h3>
<p>里斯本四日中央社電　海通社訊，華盛頓息：美國務卿赫爾昨宣稱，美原任駐英大使意南特，調任爲駐蘇聯大使，駐英大使一缺將田紐傑賽州長杜氏繼任。</p>
<h3>東綫空軍活躍　德蘇準備大戰　塞勒特河中游激戰中</h3>
<p>瑞典京城五日中央社電　蘇軍現仍在羅馬尼亞東部塞勒特河中游之塔古爾福魯莫斯（Tatgul－Rrumos）至巴杜薩尼（Botusani）地方繼續進攻，爲德方所承認。又據德軍偵察機報告，蘇軍因準備大舉進攻，正努力改編步兵，改善後方基地工作，故僅以空軍爲主要活動。現德蘇空軍主要目的，均在破壞敵方基地及陣地工作。據蘇軍當局發表。蘇空軍三日襲擊舊波領勒伏夫及斯坦尼斯勒伏兩市周邊及羅馬尼亞東部雅賽附近德軍機塲鐵路等，三四兩日夜間轟炸塞伐斯托波爾。又德空軍三日約一百五十架，猛炸轟斯特河下渝之蒂拉斯波爾穌軍基地，另一隊襲擊泰諾波爾蘇方飛機塲及克里米亞半島之蘇軍某基地。</p>
<h3>發展華北鋁業　充實航空工業資材　山本大東亞次官視察後談話</h3>
<p>以山本大東亞省次官爲團長，率領陸·海·軍需。大藏，運通各省的關係者數十名所組成的華北，蒙疆產業視察團一行，於上月六日自東京出發，七日抵靑島後，即分總務·製鐵·煤·輕金屬四班實地視察·歷時十日，二十三日啓程歸國。日本內地的鐵，煤輕金屬等戰力物資增產，增送的隘路·因此次的視察而打開了。此舉對於日本戰力的增强·實有極大的助力。</p>
<p>視察終了後歸抵北京的山本次官，二十一日在北京飯店談稱：</p>
<p>本人曾親歷靑島·唐山·天津·濟南·張店·張家口·大同·太原各地，各地戰力資源的開發，大多由中國方面自主，但日本對華北的期待頗大，故此次視察極有意義。</p>
<p>華北常初因急於建設，生產不能與之並行，而產生了隘路。經重加檢討的結果，在此次的視察中，關於增强生產，對日貢獻，與當地民生的安定，由於農作物的豐收，預料將獲得預期的結果。</p>
<p>在中國，像日本內地一樣迅急進行，反不能成功。道一點，因此次的視祭，不僅大東亞省，各省的關係者亦有新的認識·但各地對中國人似尚缺之訓練與研究，茲希望適應日本國內情勢而愈加奮發</p>
<h3>利用當地資材</h3>
<p>技術方面，必須把分由日本供給器材，百分之百的利用當地所能有的資材。當地的直接擔任者，此時必須改換思想，做一個對華新政策的實踐者。又在勞務關係上，亦屬使中國人協力開發，善加指導。</p>
<p>華北的開發，十八年度並未達到計劃量。但十九年度可望有比上年較好的成績。尤其在輕金屬部門，有可稱世界第一的　土，本年度起，將製煉爲鋁，成爲日本航空工業的基本資材之一。</p>
<p>今後尚將繼續視察，希望有所發見，以資增强戰力。</p>
<p>山本大東亞次官二十三日下午自靑島飛抵福岡飛行塲，略事休息後即乘機歸京。在雁巢飛行塲談稱：</p>
<p>我們的旅行乃在想打開增强戰力的各生產部門之隘路，華北食糧情形，今年因雨水調和，此去年大見增加。鐵·煤等地下資源的開發，現已踏上軌道。（翔：譯自四月二十四日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>「特設防護團」　應加强組織防空部盼各界完成準備</h3>
<p>據上海特別市市民防空本部發表：查本市各處之「特設防護團」，經市民之協力合作，現已略具規模，但其應付急難時之一切準備，仍未臻完善。一旦敵機來襲，各機關·公司·大厦·工廠及高大建築物，極易成爲轟炸之目標，故普通防護團與特設防護團，必須密切連絡，相輔而行，務使市民防空組織，臻於萬全。惟就目前情形而言，特設防護團之組織，誠覺落後，際此戰局日益激化之秋，防空當局，深望各機關公司工廠等，均能從速傾注全力，加强「特設防護團」之組織，益使健全，至於各大厦之業主及管理人，亦應共膺時艱，組織强有力之「特設防護團」。</p>
<h3>高層建築投假想彈</h3>

<h3>鹽田大尉　分析最近戰局　英美戰略時遭失敗</h3>
<p>日駐華艦隊報道部鹽田大尉，昨於聯合報道常會中，對英美企圖利用中國大陸，進攻日本，加以分析，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>英美鑒於太平洋戰局失利，及與日本接近作戰頗爲困難，故最近企圖由太平洋假追菲島至中國大陸，欲以中國大陸爲根據地，利用飛機謀進攻日本，與日本作最後之作戰，但此種作戰動向，吾人早已洞燭其奸，必不得逞。且麥克沃塞尼米資近已脫離美亞洲艦隊，各自單獨作戰，欲由馬紹爾羣島及新幾內亞方面，向菲島進攻，但麥克沃塞及尼米資以戰綫愈拖愈長，致作戰未能順利進行，且於戰略上，並非穩扎穩打，往往立足未穩，即繼續進攻，故時時失敗，損失綦重，充分顯露美國之國民性。</p>
<p>在澳洲方面，亦因蒙受重大損失，而呌苦連天，首相寇丁以人力資源不足，曾要求英美供給，同時紐西蘭吉相佛萊塞亦感人力匱乏，而籲請英美援助，但英美人力資源，自身亦感不足，故企圖利用中國龐大之人力資源，進攻日本，以減少自身的犧牲。然目下重慶政權下之中國人民，均已逐漸明瞭英美之用心，而作尊重主權之要求，且英美軍隊不但在重慶桂林昆明等地，任意騷擾人民，不堪其苦，即英國本土駐入美軍，亦發生同樣情形，其所受侮辱，不啻一戰敗國，故英國特別擴大宣傳東亞戰局之重要，使美國轉移目標，進軍東亞。其次關於信款問題，英國在大東亞戰爭開始時，曾將五千萬鎊貸與渝方，結果無濟於事，而今再度貸款渝方，實無異虛文，於事無補。</p>
<h3>市區戶口油　今日起普售</h3>

<h3>松平情報部長　談英渝貸款　重慶政權飲鴆止渴</h3>
<p>盟邦在滬陸海外報道常會，昨（五）日午後三時在匯中飯店五樓，會見本市各報記者，首由日大使館上海事務所松平情報部長，就英對渝貸款問題，發表談話加次：關於渝英問貸款問題，於二年前早經英政府宜傳，然以英方條件苛刻，談判無法順利進行，致一再延遲，至本（五）月二日，始由英政府發表對渝方貸款五千萬鎊，傳聞此次英渝間貸款成立，條件中渝方主權喪失極大，除將資源開發權，讓予英國外，並允英在其境內敷設鐵道等。查重慶政權自事變以來，對外借款已有多次，計英金一萬萬鎊，美金十萬萬元，舊幣十二萬萬元。及三千一百五十萬法郎，再加此次英政府貸款五千萬鎊，合計總額，依當地匯兌黑市統計約在舊幣五百萬萬元以上，渝方債台高築，民衆負祖日重，由此可見，而重慶政權依借債用作東亞人自相殘殺，實屬飲鴆止渴。</p>

<h3>一區公署職員　改善待遇的我見</h3>
<p>— 似命</p>
<p>第一區公署最近所定之改善員待遇辦法，約分職員為兩類：一，巳結婚者。二，未結婚者。前者之薪津及物資配給皆優於後者。誠然，此有正當理由可為解；蓋已結婚者，有家室之累；未結婚者，祇單身一人耳，其日常之費用亦必少於前者。但，我國家庭向有「養子防老」之習俗，且一家之費用亦皆全部仰給於生產者。並非各自為政而自賺自用。若今有人，家有年老之父母，故不能生產，下有幼弟少妹，又祗能消費，則其雖未曾結婚而其負擔豈又輕於已結婚者耶？</p>
<p>根據上列資料，故吾爲準繩，而應以視其經濟之負擔輕重爲原則。欲明白其經濟負擔之輕重，必先須調查清楚各個家庭經濟狀況；生產這幾人？月入共幾何？消費者幾人？每月最低限額之消費爲幾果，而商酌得進？如次費用，又能防止其浪費，不亦公平乎？</p>
<p>孟子日：「老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼。」今後者，每月所得尚難維持其個人之生活，而又有何餘力以老吾老，幼吾幼乎？故祇能示其長幼以愛莫能助，心有餘而力不足而已。此不能老吾老，幼吾幼，豈是其之過也。俗云：「人皆私其妻子。」我不信之。</p>
<h3>配給跑　鞋大學生何以無份</h3>
<p>— 劉松</p>
<p>日前報載本市中小學生有配給跑鞋的消息，並且已經發給配給證，在最短期中使可憑證領鞋，這種關懷學生的舉動，當然耍感謝主管當局，不過所配給者獨少却大學生，不知是何用意。要知道「大學生」和「中，小學生」同是不能生產的消費者，一樣需要家長供給用費，需要國家培植的人，為什麽配給主管當局不為大學生家長著想不爲大學生們設法呢？何況大學生家長的祖負只有比「中小學生家長」來的重，當這百物高漲時，也不知有若干的大學生家長正為他們子女的衣著二焦急呢？況且鞋子是人人要穿，正如米油家家要用一樣，應當一視同仁，凡學生皆應配給，所以希望主管當局將配給的對象擴大起來，將大學生野列在配給的範圍之內，或者希望主管當局在中小學生配給手續淸理之後，再爲本市的大學生辦一次泡學配給，則本市的許多大學生與大學生家畏也是同樣的感謝。</p>
<h3>修羅（四）</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐維著洪　洋譯</p>
<p>（到東京去常畫家吧！）</p>
<p>決定這個計劃的時候，是山中颯颯的秋風業已迫近硫黃谷的時候。</p>
<p>前面早已關過，隆夫是具有費才的，不僅圖畫超人一等，且對於油畫器具也非常喜獸，然而至於想以書畫為終身的職業，却是從未　過的。從未感覺到賽畫具有絕大的愛慕。</p>
<p>然而現在，不能不勉強喜數盡。不能不完成畫家的志願。</p>
<p>這是因為他認為畫畫是與「海軍」最無關係的職業。這是因為他認為與海軍最相反的適當工作。</p>
<p>（如果拼命幹，像我這樣人，也決不會當不了畫家……」</p>
<p>他的目的，只是想常畫家。只要成為社會上一般人所稱的畫家，就會心滿意足。他認為，這就是對命運的報復。於是就沒有再想念其他的餘地。</p>
<p>在這樣狂亂的腦海中，竟把父母忘到九霄雲外。自己並不是沒有想到，假如失踪後，雙親是會怎樣担心的。蹤或寬恕自己，但也決不會贊成放棄了只剩四五個月就畢業的中學。</p>
<p>但，他終於沒有在二中繼續讀書的勇氣了。就是單單想到再和軍人組的同學們見面這件事，也甚至立刻就發狂起來。</p>
<p>（請給我三年的似期。一定成為一個成名的晝家，而榮歸家鄉的。）</p>
<p>他在心中，這樣對父母請求。實際上，當時在東京，假如三年內專心用功，則一定成為成名的畫家，這是誰都相信的。</p>
<p>另外有一件事，即減輕雙親担心的事。這就是妹妹枝小姐。他只對於枝小姐，偷偷地告訴過他要出走的秘密。這是她在足期六，到硫黃谷去玩的時候，他不能不把準備的計劃整個告訴她。然而，她並沒有吃驚。同時還非常鼓勵哥哥的出走。</p>
<p>「哥哥也是一個男子漢大丈夫，怎能屈居鹿見島一生呢？假如你走了，我可以一個人担任兩個人地孝順雙親，請你不要掛心，安心地到東京去吧！」</p>
<p>同時，兄妹二人早已秘密約定，假如隆夫在東京法生大的困難時，就去通知她，這就是出走的條件。</p>

        <h1>1944.05.06</h1>
<h3>Mourning Marshal Koga</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced that Marshal Koga, Commander of the Combined Fleet, had died in action while directing frontline operations from his aircraft in March. The sad news has arrived, and we are deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Marshal Koga was a famous Japanese naval general. He succeeded Marshal Yamamoto as Commander of the Combined Fleet last May, not only inheriting the position but also inheriting the loyal and courageous will. He followed in Marshal Yamamoto's footsteps, dying a heroic death for his country. While this is unfortunate for his personal life, it fully demonstrates the spirit of "regarding death as returning home" in the loyal and courageous spirit of the Japanese Navy. Soldiers originally consider sacrificing themselves on the battlefield as a glory. Therefore, Marshal Koga has indeed "accomplished his mission and sacrificed his life, without shame whether looking up or down."</p>
<p>We recognize that decades of training have cultivated a traditional spirit of unity, loyalty, and courage for the country in the Japanese Navy. Marshal Koga's death in action will further arouse the spirit of shared hatred and determination to fight among all Japanese naval officers and soldiers, encouraging them to bravely annihilate the enemy in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>After reading the statements from the Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters and Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the China Fleet, we further understand that Marshal Koga's achievements and loyal and courageous spirit during his lifetime are a real and indelible light. In addition to expressing our deepest condolences, we hope that Marshal Koga's spirit will endure forever and serve as a model for soldiers in all countries of Greater East Asia.</p>
<h3>Rescuing the Coal Shortage</h3>
<p>The current decline in industrial production in Shanghai is a phenomenon that we have repeatedly pointed out as being the most contradictory in the midst of calls for increased production. Examining the reasons for the decline in industrial production, the main factors are energy and raw materials. We will now elaborate on the issue of energy.</p>
<p>The source of energy is coal. Because Shanghai's coal reserves are not abundant and transportation is difficult, the electricity company authorities have repeatedly hoped that users would conserve electricity and limit the amount used. This is a passive measure. The active and immediate solution is to clear the source of coal and continuously transport it, so that electricity supply is not lacking anywhere.</p>
<p>Indeed, in this time of war, it is a matter of course to practice thrift, limit electricity consumption, and save coal for wartime needs. However, for electricity used in production that benefits the war effort and the people's livelihood, it is acceptable to make it as economical as possible and avoid waste. But it is absolutely unacceptable to reduce production capacity or make it impossible to produce. Therefore, when the electricity company reduces power supply due to coal shortages, its allocation should be considered fair and reasonable. What is meant by reasonable is to distinguish between consumptive and productive uses, to distinguish between the importance of benefits for the war effort and the people's livelihood, and to stipulate which should be reduced? Which should not be reduced? To what extent should each be reduced? If universal restrictions are imposed without following reasonable standards, the effectiveness of production enterprises will decline, and the interests of the war effort and the people's livelihood will be affected.</p>
<p>On the one hand, we hope that the electricity authorities will pay attention to the rationality of allocation. At the same time, we hope that they will actively consider clearing the transportation of coal. Moreover, coal shortages not only affect electricity supply, but also affect the fuel for people's livelihood. Therefore, clearing the transportation of coal is an urgent task to adjust wartime production and ensure fuel for the people's livelihood. However, we also know that there are two fundamental problems in clearing the transportation of coal: one is the problem of coal production, and the other is the problem of transportation capacity. These two problems are actually different from peacetime. Therefore, we propose:</p>
<p>Electricity for factories must first be carefully classified. For example, factories producing wartime military supplies or daily necessities should be fully supplied with electricity; factories producing non-essential or consumer goods should have their supply reduced to the minimum or stopped altogether. The determination of the above categories should be made by the competent authorities as soon as possible. Secondly, electricity for hospitals and cultural and public welfare organizations should be relaxed in consideration of actual needs. Electricity for civilians should be drastically reduced again, especially for those who play mahjong under electric lights at night, should be warned or have their supply stopped.</p>
<p>The importance of coal for people's livelihood is no less than that of food. Currently, coal balls are manufactured every month as a household ration, but in reality, it is far from sufficient. We hope that the authorities will allocate more coal, and at the same time strictly supervise the manufacturing quantity and prevent corruption, and completely eliminate black market prices.</p>
<p>As for the source of coal, some people advocate developing coal mines in Central China and reorganizing old mines. This is certainly a fundamental solution, but it takes a long time and cannot solve the immediate problem. We believe that the transportation of coal from Qingdao and Haizhou to the south is more convenient. There are two transportation routes: water and land. For waterways, a large number of wooden sailboats should be hired to transport coal south via the sea or the canal. For land transportation, trains should be scheduled to stop carrying passengers for one or two days a week, or reduce passenger capacity, and use the surplus vehicles to transport coal.</p>
<p>The lack of coal is an extremely serious problem in both industrial production and people's livelihood. We hope that insightful people in the industrial and commercial sectors will jointly discuss and organize a transportation organization, hire wooden boats, and assist the authorities in loading and transporting coal. At the same time, we hope that all relevant authorities will pay attention to this, contact each other, promptly discuss the entire concrete plan, and work together to rescue Shanghai's coal shortage, that is, to realize increased production and strengthen combat power.</p>

In April of the 18th year of Showa (1943), he succeeded Marshal Yamamoto as commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, and died in action on the front lines in March of the 19th year of Showa (1944).</p>

<h3>Statement by Director Kurihara</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Kurihara Etsuzo, Director of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, issued the following statement regarding the death of General Koga Mineichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet: The news of General Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who died in action while commanding frontline operations from his aircraft in March of this year, was announced by the Imperial Headquarters on the afternoon of the 5th. His Majesty the Emperor, in recognition of General Koga's distinguished achievements during his lifetime, has posthumously bestowed upon him the title of Marshal, admitted him to the Marshal's Office, awarded him the First Class Order of Merit, and conferred upon him the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers. Since Marshal Koga assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet last April, he has not shied away from danger, personally venturing to the front lines to command the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet in battle, hence his death in action. During the Marshal's tenure, the war situation became increasingly fierce. Recently, recognizing the great responsibility of being the supreme commander, the Marshal worked day and night, exhausting all his efforts to promote the traditional spirit of the Japanese Imperial Navy and lead the entire army in battle. The current war situation is at a critical juncture for the nation's survival, and this unexpected event is deeply regrettable. The entire navy, with the new commander-in-chief General Toyoda as its core, will further raise its fighting spirit under the Emperor's authority, advance on the path of annihilating the enemy, inherit the spirit of Marshals Yamamoto and Koga, and continue to fight to repay the nation.</p>
<h3>One American Plane　Shot Down in Longxia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in South China states that at 5:00 PM on the 1st, an American B-25 aircraft intruded into the skies over Xiamen, indiscriminately strafing with machine guns. The local Japanese anti-aircraft artillery immediately fired upon it and shot it down. The aircraft crashed into the mountains near Guanwei on Jinmen Island.</p>
<h3>Two Squadrons of Chongqing Troops　Sneak into Vietnam but Fail</h3>
<p>Hanoi, 5th (Central News Agency) – On the night of the 2nd, two squadrons of Chongqing troops illegally sneaked into the Wei'en and Ku'en areas, about 30 kilometers north of Vietnam, intending to plunder gambling dens. The Vietnamese army in the area immediately repelled them, capturing about 30 Chongqing soldiers (including officers, the elderly, and the weak), and seizing four machine guns and forty-six rifles.</p>
<h3>Director Matsushima Praises　Marshal Koga's Achievements</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters yesterday announced the news of the death in action of General Koga, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet. This is another significant sacrifice made by Japan to protect Greater East Asia, and it deeply shocks the hundred million people of East Asia. Colonel Matsushima, Chief of the Press Section of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement on the 5th, praising Commander Koga's contributions and revealing the Japanese Navy's determination to bravely annihilate the enemy. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>On May 5th, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced the news of the death in action of General Koga Mineichi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet. Commander Koga, holding the great responsibility of the supreme commander of the Combined Fleet, died in action on the front lines from his aircraft, which is deeply regrettable. During Commander Koga's time in office over the past year, whenever Japan engaged in battle, Admiral Togo repeatedly declined requests from his staff to go to the command tower, stating each time: "I am old. For the sake of Japan's future, you should go to the command tower and do your best." He always stood on the bridge in the hail of bullets, never moving slightly. Now, both Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle and Commander Koga's death in action are a testament to the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, which cannot be compared with the publicity surrounding General MacArthur's command from within a cruiser during the landing in New Guinea. The ancient East Asian strategist Sun Tzu once said, "Place them in a position of no escape, and they will then fight to the death." The Japanese admirals are truly practitioners of Sun Tzu's Art of War. Commander Koga pioneered a tactic previously unseen in military history, which the Allied side greatly feared and called the "Interception Tactic." Commander Koga's Interception Tactic has annihilated many Allied soldiers in the Pacific, or caused Allied soldiers to shed a great deal of blood in the jungles of various islands. This should be well known to Allied soldiers. Last May, the Yamazaki Unit on Attu Island annihilated 15,000 Allied soldiers. Also, on Makin and Tarawa Islands in the Gilbert Islands, about 30,000 American troops bled. In addition, the sacrifices of American troops on Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, Bougainville Island, New Britain Island, New Ireland Island, and in New Guinea have been historically significant. At sea, there have been battles such as the Battle of Runga Point, the Naval Battle of Kula Gulf, the Naval Battle of Kolombangara, and the five Bougainville air battles, the four Gilbert Islands air battles, and the Marshall Islands air battle. They have sunk four battleships, twenty aircraft carriers, twenty-six cruisers, twenty-nine destroyers, one special service ship, thirty submarines, fifteen torpedo boats, six unidentified types of boats, one battleship or cruiser, seven cruisers or large destroyers, two hundred boats, and one hundred and ninety transports. They have also destroyed four battleships, seven aircraft carriers, thirty cruisers, nineteen destroyers, seven torpedo boats, two unidentified types of ships, two battleships or cruisers, eight cruisers, eighty-two boats, and three submarine chasers. About 3,000 or more aircraft have been shot down, and about 200,000 enemy naval and air personnel have been killed in action. This proves the brilliant results of Commander Koga's Interception Tactic. The position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet has now been succeeded by Admiral Toyoda. The morale of the entire fleet is increasingly strong, and they are now waiting for an opportunity to destroy the American military forces deployed in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Refreshes Police Administration</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – In order to revitalize its police administration, the Manchukuo government has formulated an outline for the refreshing and streamlining of police administration. The key points are as follows: Simplification of the organization; establishment of a hierarchical system with clearly defined duties and responsibilities. The focus of police personnel will be placed in key areas. Of particular note is the emphasis on improving the quality of police officers. The concrete measures to be taken will center on police officers as the main force in law enforcement, with a view to reorganizing the police system. Since the establishment of Manchukuo, the police system has focused on military force, but this revitalization aims to transform the military police into an intelligent police force. Therefore, its future activities are highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>Turkey Must Prepare　to Deal with the Crisis　Foreign Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu recently told reporters that we are currently living in dangerous times, and before the crisis is eliminated, it is imperative that our daily lives adapt to the environment and prepare constantly. If we are forced to make a final decision to protect national interests, we will not need to panic. When discussing air defense measures, the Foreign Minister said that we must not ignore possible dangers, otherwise, we will suffer serious consequences.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Issues　Huge Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to the German News Agency: According to a report from TASS, the Soviet government has decided to issue its third wartime public bonds, amounting to 25 billion rubles, and has issued a declaration calling on the public to cooperate. It is said that the issuance of these bonds gives the public an opportunity to show their love for the party and the country.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Spain Returns Home</h3>
<p>Madrid, 5th (Central News Agency) – According to Havas: British Ambassador Sir Samuel Hoare and his wife left by plane yesterday, via Lisbon, to return home for consultations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Imphal　British Troops on the Southern Front Gradually Retreating</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from the Indian front states that the battle between the Japanese and British forces for Imphal has become increasingly fierce recently. With the cooperation of the air force, the Japanese army is gradually advancing. The fall of Kohima is imminent, and the battle for Manipur is also nearing its final stage. The enemy forces between Imphal and Kohima are struggling to reverse the decline, and are reinforcing with large numbers of tanks, artillery, and air force, hoping to engage in a desperate defense. However, in any case, the enemy's base of Imphal has been controlled by the Japanese and Indian armies, so even if they want to reorganize, it will only be a last-ditch effort.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) – Washington report: US Secretary of War Stimson told reporters on the 4th that the situation on the Burma front was as follows: The Japanese offensive has become more intense in the last two weeks, and fierce battles in various places have formed a major war front from the Indian Ocean to the Chinese border. According to a Reuters report from Candi, Ceylon, on the 4th, the fighting on the Burma-India front can be divided into three areas: the Kohima-Palel area, the Maungdaw-Buthidaung road area, and the battle of the airborne troops in northern Burma. The anti-Axis forces have suffered attacks from the Japanese army in various places. A communiqué from the Southeast Asia Anti-Axis Command on the 4th also acknowledged the failure of the overall operation in Burma: The withdrawal from Akyab in southern Burma back to Bengal has failed, and they are now gradually retreating.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Main Forces on the West Side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway　Suffer a Blow　Political and Military Circles Greatly Shocked</h3>
<p>Hankou, 5th (Central News Agency) – The elite Japanese troops occupying the front lines of Henan defense in Xuchang, Zhengzhou, Xinzheng, and other places launched a mechanized mobile war on the west side of the Beijing-Hankou Railway on the night of the 3rd against the defeated enemy. With close cooperation from army aircraft, they are now encircling the enemy and beginning a fierce and large-scale annihilation battle. Since the start of the operation, only twenty days ago, they have defeated the 23rd Division and the Provisional 11th Division under the 85th Army of the Chongqing forces, the Provisional 27th Division and the New 29th Division under the Provisional 15th Army, and the New 42nd Division under the 18th Army, and the 22nd Division under the 12th Army, a total of seven divisions, with a force of approximately 60,000. At the same time, the loss of command cadres is no less than 15,000. In order to reverse this decline, the Chongqing forces are now continuing to increase troops in the eastern part of the Funiu Mountains, holding strong positions to resist. The Japanese soldiers active on the new battlefield in Henan are currently braving the sky-covering dust, the dangerous gorges of the Funiu Mountains, and all kinds of difficulties, continuing their attack. Also, it was confirmed on the 4th that the damage to the enemy's cadres was as follows: Killed in action: Zhang Cemin, Deputy Commander of the 85th Army; Lü Gongliang, Commander of the New 29th Division; Mu Jinze, Commander of the 110th Division.

<h3>Ministry of Industry Starts to Handle Food Administration Work</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since the Ministry of Food was abolished, all food administration work has been handled by the Ministry of Industry. The ministry has now assigned the work to its existing departments according to its nature. It is learned that regarding matters of increasing production, it is planned to set up an inspection office or supervision office in the Ministry's Department of Agriculture and Forestry to continue promoting it.

<h3>North China Holds Banking Industry Conference</h3>
<p>Beijing, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Joint Reserve Bank of China convened a conference of bankers in North China on April 28th at the Beijing Bankers' Association. President Wang Shijing of the Joint Reserve Bank attended and gave a speech, explaining the key points of the Joint Reserve Bank's future policies as follows: The total amount of bank savings in China this year is estimated at 500 million yuan. It is hoped that all financial institutions will double their efforts to complete this industrial goal. The publicly set interest rate of 5% to 1% per annum for Joint Reserve Bank savings and loans, which has been implemented since March this year, will be increased from May 1st. In order to absorb savings and eliminate competition among financial institutions, a savings and loan agreement will be implemented among banks in Beijing, Xinjing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Baoding, Yantai, and other eight cities from May 1st. The Joint Reserve Bank's loan system will be revised, and extraction management will be implemented. Loan limits will be set according to the conditions of each extraction location, and the lowest interest rate loans will be implemented within the limits. The restrictions on private remittances from North China to Central China will be lifted.</p>
<h3>Replacement of Chongqing Customs Commissioner</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - According to reliable sources, Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Finance in Chongqing, recently issued an order to transfer the position of Inspector General of Customs, with an American named Liddell succeeding the Englishman Jones as Inspector General of Customs. It has been the practice for the position of Commissioner of Customs in Chongqing to be held by a British national, but this sudden change to an American shows that American influence in Chongqing is gradually expanding and overwhelming that of Britain. Furthermore, Britain and the United States announced last year that they would abolish unequal treaties, and mentioned changing the Inspector General of Customs, but the position is still being filled by an American, which shows that the so-called abolition of unequal treaties by Britain and the United States is nothing but deception.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Suppresses Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Tianjin Municipal Government, recognizing that the high commodity prices in Tianjin have greatly affected people's livelihoods, has repeatedly implemented effective measures to suppress them, such as cracking down on hoarding and preventing profiteering. Recently, in order to thoroughly reduce commodity prices, it has decided to implement a mandatory price marking system and reiterated the previous order, instructing the Chamber of Commerce to notify all industries to implement it.</p>
<h3>Goebbels Discusses Key to Success or Failure of Invasion of Europe; "An Army Moved by Righteousness Will Surely Win"</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels recently published an article in the magazine "Deutschland," entitled "Indeterminate Factors," discussing the key to success or failure in the invasion of Europe. The main idea is that the British and Americans will face countless difficulties in invading the European continent, and if they cannot accurately grasp the various factors that will determine the future development of the war, they will never be certain of the final success or failure of the war. In other words, if a decisive victory cannot be achieved in the air war, then the strength of the enemy is known, and the enemy also knows the strength of our side. Comparing the possibilities of victory for both sides, our hope for final victory is a well-founded conclusion. We have a clever plan in hand, and we will not show it to the enemy until the decisive moment. Moreover, an army moved by righteousness will surely win. The British and American soldiers are traveling across the ocean to invade other people's territories, merely to satisfy the greed of a few financial groups, while we are fighting for the survival of our motherland and the security of the continent. Therefore, as we look to the future, we have a heartfelt belief in final victory.</p>
<h3>Tension in London</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency): London's Daily Express reports that Americans in London are very excited about the invasion of Europe. The editorial departments of London's newspapers are constantly paying attention to news about the invasion of Europe. Churches across the country are waiting for the radio to send out the signal for the invasion of Europe, and will then ring bells to summon people to prayer. Colonel Johnson, head of the military transport bureau, has called on all private travel to be completely suspended when the invasion of Europe begins, as a large number of wounded soldiers must be transported back inland, and troops and supplies must be transported to the ports. Every carriage is urgently needed, and no consideration will be given to people traveling for pleasure.</p>
<h3>Aerial Offensive</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson said yesterday at the intelligence desk that the British and American air forces are bombing the German transportation network as a concentrated bombing raid on the eve of the invasion of Europe, with the aim of disrupting German transportation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since March, the British and American air forces have intensified their bombing of Germany, which can be regarded as the prelude to the opening of the second front. For days, the anti-Axis forces have been using three to four thousand aircraft to bomb German military facilities, urban factories, transportation facilities, and other Axis countries. The bombs they drop are like torrential rain, averaging more than 500 bombs per hour, or 12,000 tons per day. The German military's measures and the extent of the damage are as follows: The methods used by enemy aircraft to bomb Berlin can be roughly divided into daytime and nighttime bombings. The purposes of the bombing can be roughly divided into pure military bombing, surprise bombing, production facility bombing, and transportation route bombing. Regarding nighttime bombing, each time the British and Americans participate with about 500 to 800 medium-sized aircraft, but each time they often fail to achieve their purpose due to the German air force's interception, so they inevitably fall into blind bombing, resulting in four or five tenths of the residential areas in the suburbs of Berlin being reduced to rubble. As for daytime bombing, the number is less than nighttime bombing. Most of the aircraft are American large bombers, about 300 to 800 aircraft each time, with the aim of destroying factory transportation facilities, but because the loss of aircraft is too great, it is difficult to achieve the intended purpose.</p>
<h3>US Army Casualties Now Exceed 150,000</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson announced yesterday that the US Army has lost a total of 159,302 people on all battlefields as of April 30.</p>
<h3>Chan Nant Transferred to Ambassador to Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch, Huitong News Agency), Washington dispatch: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that Chan Nant, the current US Ambassador to Britain, has been transferred to be the Ambassador to the Soviet Union. The post of Ambassador to Britain will be succeeded by the Governor of New Jersey, Du.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Air Force Active; Germany and Soviet Union Prepare for Great War; Fierce Fighting in Middle Reaches of Seret River</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soviet forces are still continuing their offensive in the Tagu-Frumos to Botusani area in the middle reaches of the Seret River in eastern Romania, which is acknowledged by the German side. According to German reconnaissance aircraft reports, Soviet forces are working hard to reorganize their infantry and improve their rear base work in preparation for a major offensive, so they are only using the air force as their main activity. The main objective of the German and Soviet air forces is to destroy the enemy's base and position work. According to the Soviet authorities, the Soviet Air Force attacked the vicinity of the old Polish cities of Lviv and Stanislavov, as well as German airfields and railways near Iasi in eastern Romania, on the 3rd. On the evenings of the 3rd and 4th, they bombed Sevastopol. Also, about 150 German aircraft bombed the Soviet base at Tiraspol, Lower Yishu River, on the 3rd. Another team attacked the Soviet airfield at Ternopol and a Soviet base on the Crimean Peninsula.</p>
<h3>Developing Aluminum Industry in North China to Enrich Resources for Aviation Industry; Speech by Vice Minister Yamamoto of Greater East Asia Ministry After Inspection</h3>
<p>A delegation led by Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, composed of dozens of people related to the Army, Navy, Ministry of Munitions, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Transportation, departed from Tokyo on the 6th of last month. After arriving in Qingdao on the 7th, they divided into four groups: General Affairs, Iron Manufacturing, Coal, and Light Metals, to conduct on-site inspections for ten days. They departed on the 23rd and returned to Japan. The bottleneck in the increased production and transportation of strategic materials such as iron, coal, and light metals in the Japanese mainland has been opened up by this inspection. This move has greatly helped to strengthen Japan's war power.</p>
<p>After the inspection, Vice Minister Yamamoto, who returned to Beijing, said at the Beijing Hotel on the 21st:</p>
<p>I have personally visited Qingdao, Tangshan, Tianjin, Jinan, Zhangdian, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Taiyuan, and other places. The development of strategic resources in various places is mostly carried out independently by the Chinese side, but Japan has high expectations for North China, so this inspection is very meaningful.</p>
<p>In North China, the initial eagerness to build resulted in a bottleneck because production could not keep up. After a thorough review, it is expected that the results of enhancing production, contributing to Japan, and stabilizing the local people's livelihood will be achieved due to the abundant harvest of crops in this inspection.</p>
<p>In China, it is impossible to succeed by proceeding as rapidly as in Japan. This point has been newly recognized not only by the Ministry of Greater East Asia but also by those related to various ministries through this inspection. However, there seems to be a lack of training and research on the Chinese people in various places, and I hope that they will adapt to the situation in Japan and work harder.</p>
<h3>Utilizing Local Resources</h3>
<p>In terms of technology, we must make full use of the materials that can be obtained locally, rather than relying entirely on supplies from Japan. Those directly in charge locally must change their thinking at this time and become practitioners of the new policy toward China. In terms of labor relations, we must also enlist the cooperation of the Chinese people in development and provide good guidance.</p>
<p>The development of North China did not reach the planned amount in the 18th year. However, better results than last year can be expected in the 19th year. Especially in the light metals sector, there is a kind of soil that can be called the best in the world. Starting this year, it will be refined into aluminum and become one of the basic materials for the Japanese aviation industry.</p>
<p>We will continue to inspect in the future, hoping to find something that can be used to enhance our war power.</p>
<p>Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry flew from Qingdao to Fukuoka Airfield in the afternoon of the 23rd. After a short rest, he took a plane back to Tokyo. He said at Yanchao Airfield:</p>
<p>Our trip was to open up the bottleneck in various production sectors to enhance our war power. The food situation in North China this year has greatly increased compared to last year due to favorable rainfall. The development of underground resources such as iron and coal is now on track.

<h3>"Specially Established Protection Corps" Should Strengthen Organization; Air Defense Headquarters Hopes All Sectors Complete Preparations</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Special Municipal Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters: It has been found that the "Specially Established Protection Corps" in various parts of the city has been roughly established with the cooperation of the citizens, but all preparations for dealing with emergencies are still not perfect. Once enemy planes attack, various agencies, companies, buildings, factories, and tall buildings are likely to become targets for bombing. Therefore, ordinary protection corps and specially established protection corps must maintain close contact and work together to ensure that the citizens' air defense organization is complete. However, in the current situation, the organization of specially established protection corps is truly lagging behind. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce, the air defense authorities deeply hope that all agencies, companies, factories, etc. will quickly devote their full efforts to strengthen the organization of "specially established protection corps" and make them healthier. As for the owners and managers of large buildings, they should also share the difficulties of the times and organize strong "specially established protection corps."</p>
<h3>High-Rise Buildings to Have Simulated Bombs Dropped</h3>
<p>It is reported that on the Air Defense Day of this month, the 9th, the local Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities and the Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters have stipulated that, in addition to ordinary training, simulated bombs and incendiary bombs will be dropped on high-rise buildings. It is hoped that citizens will quickly complete preparations to ensure safety.</p>
<p>According to the Times reporter who obtained information from news sources, the Shanghai Port Water Air Defense Organization, which covers 21 miles along the Huangpu River, has a total of more than two thousand units in its various corps and is scheduled to hold a large-scale air defense drill next week (May 9). It is reported that the key personnel of the Water Air Defense Headquarters are selected by the Japanese Navy and the Chinese Customs. At that time, they will supervise drills such as throwing grenades and extinguishing fires.</p>
<h3>Captain Shiota Analyzes Recent War Situation, British and American Strategy Often Fails</h3>
<p>Captain Shiota of the Japanese Fleet Press Department gave a talk at the United Press Association yesterday, analyzing the British and American attempts to use the Chinese mainland to attack Japan, and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>The British and Americans, in view of the defeat in the Pacific War and the difficulty of engaging in close combat with Japan, have recently attempted to attack Japan by way of the Philippines to the Chinese mainland, intending to use the Chinese mainland as a base and use aircraft to attack Japan for a final battle with Japan. However, we have long been aware of this war trend and will certainly not let it succeed. Furthermore, MacArthur and Nimitz have recently separated from the US Asian Fleet and are operating independently, intending to advance towards the Philippines from the Marshall Islands and New Guinea. However, because MacArthur and Nimitz are dragging out the battle line, they have not been able to proceed smoothly, and strategically, they are not taking a steady and solid approach, often continuing to attack before they have a firm foothold. Therefore, they often fail and suffer heavy losses, fully revealing the American national character.</p>
<p>In Australia, they are also suffering heavy losses and are crying out in pain. Prime Minister Curtin, due to insufficient human resources, has requested supplies from the British and Americans. At the same time, New Zealand's Prime Minister Fraser also feels a shortage of manpower and has appealed for aid from the British and Americans. However, the British and Americans themselves also feel a shortage of human resources, so they are attempting to use China's vast human resources to attack Japan in order to reduce their own sacrifices. However, the Chinese people under the Chongqing regime are now gradually understanding the intentions of the British and Americans and are demanding respect for sovereignty. Moreover, the British and American troops are not only arbitrarily harassing the people in Chongqing, Guilin, Kunming, and other places, causing them unbearable suffering, but the same situation is occurring with the American troops stationed in the UK, who are being insulted as if they were a defeated nation. Therefore, Britain is particularly expanding its propaganda about the importance of the East Asian war situation in order to get the United States to shift its focus and advance into East Asia. Secondly, regarding the issue of loans, Britain lent 50 million pounds to the Chongqing side at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, but it was of no avail. Now, lending to the Chongqing side again is nothing more than a formality and will not help.</p>
<h3>Household Oil Rations in the City to Be Generally Sold Starting Today</h3>
<p>Since the City Food Bureau implemented the system of oil rations based on population in various districts within the lock line, in order to prevent retailers from adulterating the oil, it has ordered various shops to store oil samples in sealed bottles and display them in store counters. If citizens find that the oil they purchase does not match the sealed oil sample, they can report it to the bureau, so that they can be punished and the situation can be rectified. As for the second phase of oil distribution in each district, except for the first district, it has now been decided to start general sales from today (6th) to the 15th. Citizens in each district can purchase oil from designated edible oil retailers with the second-phase oil purchase certificates issued by the Food Bureau. Each certificate can purchase four ounces of oil, costing 13.8 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Retail donations are exempt from inspection. There will be no supplementary sales after the deadline.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Edible Oil Unified Allocation Office was authorized by the authorities to handle edible oil allocation, in addition to allocating household edible oil to citizens in phases, it also handles special food allocations for various industries. Recently, the office has suspended supply for special allocations from today because the amount of household allocations cannot be fully met.</p>

<h3>Information Director Matsudaira Discusses British Loan to Chongqing; Chongqing Regime Drinks Poison to Quench Thirst</h3>
<p>The Allied Press Association in Shanghai held a meeting with reporters from various newspapers in the city at the Huizhong Hotel on the fifth floor yesterday (5th) at 3:00 pm. First, Information Director Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office gave a speech on the British loan to Chongqing, adding the following: Regarding the loan issue between Chongqing and Britain, the British government had already advertised it two years ago. However, due to the harsh conditions of the British side, negotiations could not proceed smoothly, resulting in repeated delays. It was not until this (May) 2nd that the British government announced a loan of 50 million pounds to the Chongqing side. It is rumored that the conditions for the establishment of this loan between Britain and Chongqing involve a huge loss of sovereignty for the Chongqing side. In addition to ceding resource development rights to Britain, it also allows Britain to build railways in its territory. Since the incident, the Chongqing regime has borrowed money from foreign countries many times, including 100 million pounds in British gold, 100 million US dollars, 120 billion old yuan, and 31.5 million francs. In addition to the 50 million pounds loaned by the British government this time, the total amount, according to the local black market exchange rate, is about 5 trillion old yuan or more. The Chongqing side has a high debt burden, and the people are bearing a heavier and heavier burden. From this, it can be seen that the Chongqing regime is relying on borrowing money to use the people of East Asia to kill each other, which is truly drinking poison to quench thirst.</p>

<h3>Readers' Support for Education News</h3>

Therefore, I have made up the total to 20,000 yuan and will donate it to your newspaper's educational assistance fund. The amount is small, but it is a small blessing for my relatives and friends."</p>
<p>Pension for Educational Assistance: Ms. Hu Wang Jingyi writes: "To whom it may concern, my late husband, Mr. Zhan, worked at the General Manager's Office of the Continental Bank during his lifetime. He was frugal in his personal life, treated people with kindness and sincerity, and was happy to cultivate poor students. Unfortunately, he passed away from illness last year. I am deeply saddened and grateful to receive a pension of 3,360 yuan from the bank. I am sending the aforementioned pension in full to your office to donate to the educational assistance fund. Please publish this in the newspaper to fulfill my late husband's wishes and set an example for the people of society."</p>

<h3>My Opinion on Improving the Treatment of Staff in a District Office</h3>
<p>— Siming</p>
<p>The recent method for improving staff treatment determined by the First District Office roughly divides staff into two categories: 1. Married individuals. 2. Unmarried individuals. The salaries, allowances, and material rations of the former are superior to those of the latter. Indeed, there is a legitimate reason for this; married individuals have the burden of a family, while unmarried individuals are only single and their daily expenses are necessarily less than those of the former. However, in our country, families have the custom of "raising children to prevent old age," and the expenses of the entire family are entirely dependent on the producer. It is not a matter of each person governing themselves and earning and spending for themselves. If someone has elderly parents at home who cannot produce, and younger siblings who can only consume, then even if they are unmarried, is their burden lighter than that of married individuals?</p>
<p>Based on the above information, therefore, I believe that the principle should be to consider the weight of their economic burden. To understand the weight of their economic burden, it is necessary to first investigate clearly the economic situation of each family; how many producers? What is the total monthly income? How many consumers? What is the minimum amount of monthly consumption, and how much can be discussed? If such expenses can also prevent waste, would it not be fair?</p>
<p>Mencius said: "Respect the elderly in my family and extend that respect to the elderly in other families; love the young in my family and extend that love to the young in other families." Today, if a person's monthly income is difficult to maintain their personal life, then what remaining strength do they have to respect the elderly and love the young? Therefore, they can only show their elders and children that they are helpless and lack the power to do so. This inability to respect the elderly and love the young, is it their fault? As the saying goes, "Everyone loves their wives and children." I don't believe it.</p>
<h3>Why Are University Students Excluded From Rationed Running Shoes?</h3>
<p>— Liu Song</p>
<p>It was recently reported that primary and secondary school students in this city are being rationed running shoes, and rationing certificates have already been issued, so they will be able to collect shoes soon. This act of concern for students is of course to be thanked to the authorities in charge, but the fact that university students are excluded is puzzling. It should be known that "university students" and "primary and secondary school students" are both non-producing consumers who equally need parental support and are cultivated by the state. Why doesn't the rationing authority consider the parents of university students and find a way for university students? Moreover, the burdens of university students' parents are only heavier than those of "primary and secondary school students' parents." When the price of everything is soaring, I don't know how many university students' parents are anxious about their children's clothing. Moreover, shoes are worn by everyone, just like rice and oil are used by every household. There should be equal treatment, and all students should be rationed. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities in charge will expand the scope of rationing and include university students in the scope of rationing. Or, it is hoped that after the rationing procedures for primary and secondary school students are cleared, another round of running shoe rationing will be organized for university students in this city, so that many university students and their parents in this city will be equally grateful.</p>
<h3>Shura (4)</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyokazu, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>(Go to Tokyo and become a painter!)</p>
<p>The decision on this plan was made when the mountain wind was already approaching Sulfur Valley in the rustling autumn.</p>
<p>Long before, Longfu had excellent talent. Not only were his paintings superior, but he also liked painting equipment very much. However, the thought of making painting a lifelong career had never occurred to him. He had never felt that painting possessed great admiration.</p>
<p>However, now, he could not help but force himself to like it. He could not help but fulfill his painter's aspirations.</p>
<p>This was because he thought that painting was the profession that was most unrelated to the "navy." This was because he thought it was a suitable job that was the most opposite to the navy.</p>
<p>(If I work hard, someone like me will never fail to become a painter...)</p>
<p>His purpose was only to become a painter. As long as he became what society generally calls a painter, he would be satisfied. He believed that this was revenge against fate. Therefore, there was no room for thinking about anything else.</p>
<p>In this state of madness, he forgot his parents completely. It was not that he had not thought about how worried his parents would be if he disappeared. Even if they forgave him, they would never approve of giving up middle school with only four or five months left until graduation.</p>
<p>But, he finally did not have the courage to continue studying at the Second Middle School. Even just thinking about meeting his military comrades again made him almost go crazy immediately.</p>
<p>(Please give me three years. I will definitely become a famous painter and return home in glory.)</p>
<p>He pleaded to his parents in his heart. In fact, at that time in Tokyo, if he concentrated on his studies for three years, he would definitely become a famous painter, which everyone believed.</p>
<p>Another thing was to reduce his parents' worries. This was his younger sister, Miss Zhi. He secretly told only Miss Zhi about his secret of leaving. This was when she went to Sulfur Valley to play during her sixth menstrual period, and he could not help but tell her the entire prepared plan. However, she was not surprised. At the same time, she also greatly encouraged her brother to leave.</p>
<p>"Brother is also a real man. How can he be content to live in Lu Jian Island all his life? If you leave, I can take on the responsibility of taking care of our parents for two people. Please don't worry and go to Tokyo with peace of mind!"</p>
<p>At the same time, the brother and sister had secretly agreed long ago that if Longfu encountered great difficulties in Tokyo, he would notify her. This was the condition for leaving.</p>

<h3>Appropriate Silong Tablets Held a Charity Sale</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, I appreciate your organization's charity sale of Appropriate Silong Tablets, demonstrating your enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting people. I am hereby sending 500 bottles of medicine (20 tablets per bottle). According to the market limited price, each bottle should be worth 500 yuan, but since this is a charitable cause, I am willing to calculate it at 80%, actually selling each bottle for 400 yuan. Half of the proceeds will be donated to the medical assistance fund, and the other half will be used to replenish the factory's cost needs. Muer Chemical Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Appropriate Silong Tablets mainly treat Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococcus, Gonococcus, Streptococcus, and all other bacterial infectious diseases. Now, the Muer Chemical Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is willing to donate half of the proceeds to the medical assistance fund. This act of caring and charity is worthy of social advocacy. I hope all sectors will actively participate. Both retail and wholesale purchases are welcome. Please contact this office. You get good medicine and help a good cause, truly accomplishing two good deeds at once.</p>
<h3>Ren'aihui Andang Hospital is Financially Strained, Sincerely Requests Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Ren'aihui Andang Hospital, the main hospital on Lingbao Road (old Luban Road) Ximen Road, was founded by French nuns and has been around for 56 years. The hospital buildings are grand, and the gardens are spacious. All the equipment is quite complete. Internally, medicine is combined with treatment, accommodating over 200 impoverished patients who are hospitalized. The outpatient clinic sees as many as 700 to 800 people daily, completely free of charge, so medical services are particularly developed. The hospital's funding has always been maintained by donations from abroad. Recently, due to the European war, transportation has been hindered, and the source has long been cut off. Especially in recent years, the price of medicine has been high, and fundraising is difficult. Previously, patients were given one bowl of porridge and two meals a day, but now it has been reduced to three simple meals. If this continues, it will become more and more unclear. We sincerely request enthusiastic philanthropists from all sectors to donate according to their ability. It is best to commit to monthly donations, otherwise cash or necessities such as rice, flour, coal balls, and medicinal cotton cloth are all welcome. Doing good brings pleasure. Do not forget your kindness in rebuilding. Receiving addresses: this hospital and this newspaper's social service department. All donor titles will be collected and announced to show great faith.</p>
