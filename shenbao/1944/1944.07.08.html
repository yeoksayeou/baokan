<p>社評</p>
<h3>貢獻於商統會</h3>
<p>統制經濟，有兩種方式，其一，是由政府以行政的力量實施統制；另一，是由民間以自治精神實施統制。就我們中國而言，現在全國商業統制總會是採取後一種方式，由民間工商界組成自治的統制機構，政府僅居於監督指等的地位。</p>
<p>民開自治原則的統制工作，如期獲致統制之利，必須具備三個條件：第一個條件，也是最必要的條件，就是「商人的道德」。所謂「自治精神一，是基於道德觀念的，因爲參加商業統制工作者，在原則上應爲純粹商界人士，如果缺乏商人道德觀念，根本就無自治精神可言。如無自治精神，就難獲致統制之利。况且，統制在中國尙爲創畢，旣無規制可循，複爲民情所不習，因此，辦理稍有不填，不但無利可言，而極易形成相反的害民現象。所以，商人道德，實爲目前我國統制工作中最基本條件。至於商人道德的內容，範圍至廣，而最切要者就是在此戰時統制經濟之下，應以戰時國家的公利爲先，個人以至少數人的私利在後。</p>
<p>第二個條件，就是參加統制工作者應限於工商界人士。因為旣是商業自治性質的機構，當然應以商人爲限。如果有非商人參加，很易逐漸形成官僚機構，勢必失去商業自治的意義。例如，米糧統制工作，應以米業商人參加擔任，但事實上儘多幷非米商參加，因此形成官僚機關，措施之間，就很多遠悖事理的現象，致使米糧問題愈益趨於嚴重局面，而每况愈下，治絲益棼。</p>
<p>第三個條件，就是社會應有制裁力量。對於統制工作，發現弊竇，或有不合理措施，逆料與戰時經濟及民生有妨礙時，社會即應發揮力量，嚴格批評，糾正制裁，排除妨礙，促使趨於合理。而過去社會制裁力量，未能充分發揮，雖輿論上曾有若干制裁，但未易爲當局重視而收制裁之效。例如米統會工作，過去曾有弊竇發生，曾有種種不合理措施，雖經各報評論，尤其本報，嚴格批評，而卒未被當局所虛心採納。過去的統制工作，就整個而言，毋庸諱言是失敗多於成功的，尤共是米糧統制工作完全失敗的。最近商統會已經調整，共下並設實施統制工作的五個委員會，而山商統會在縱的方面審核監督，在橫的方面聯絡綜合。我們希望商統會必須發揮本身所賦的權職，充分運用，特別汴意商業自治精神，重視現階段統制工作應具備的必要條件。同時，對於商統會實際工作方面，我們更作如下之建議：</p>
<p>商統會之下的米糧，棉業，粉麥，油糧，日用品五統制委員會之開，無論在組織，人事，設施方面，應步伐一致，不能有脫離商統會而各自爲政的脫軌現象。目前最急迫的，米統會應從速改組，辦理結束，改組健全以後，應側重全力準備秋收時的統制方案，完備周密，合情合理，不再蹈過去失敗的覆轍。</p>
<p>紗布統制工作將與棉花統制工作合併，應從速健全組織·</p>
<p>商統會內部組織中，有企劃處一部分，可說是商統會的腦神經中樞，極關重要，應盡量吸收專門人才，担任企劃工作。上海商業團體中，頗多具有數十年歷史者，其間大有富於經騐深諳商塲習慣的人才，商統會可以延攪借用，而對於多方鑚營求聯者，必無適當才具，尤應摒絕不用，成爲人無不才，才無不用之商業自治校範機構，庶統制成爲有利於戰時國家，有益於戰時民生的工作。</p>

<h3>林宣長對渝廣播「爭取主動的出路」</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　「重慶方面各位將士，各位同志，各位同胞：</p>
<p>當我要開口從廣播中對各位談話的時候，一團無可抑制的情緒，湧在心頭。想起平漢粵漢各地的情況，眼睛里所看見的，彷彿是一堆堆的舊塜新　。耳朶裏所聽見的，彷佛以這樣的心情，還有什麼話可說。可是我深深知道，各位的心情，和我午的心情沒有兩樣，我畢竟不能不說幾句話。</p>
<p>長沙之役，許多將士犧牲了，里面有我中學生時代的同學，他是一位熱血的靑年，黃埔出身的將官。此外還有許多我所認識或不認識的將士，和他一樣的，是熱血靑年，也和他一樣的犧牲了。為什麼要這樣犧牲了呢？為英美嗎？他們是革命高潮中磨練出來的靑年，反英美是他午自從參加革命運動以來一貫的抱負。為什麼爲英美而犧牲？爲共產堂嗎？他們是十五六年以來，在反共鬥爭中流過血流過淚的靑年。為什麼為共產黨而犧牲，爲祖國……（電碼不明）變了質的抗戰，受人操縱，受人愚弄的抗戰。衹有斷送民族國家的元氣，再也不能拖延下去的，然而他們畢竟犧牲了，爲什麼這樣予不明不白的犧牲了呢？</p>
<p>本年三月，我在「重申我們的立塲」一文中，曾經鄭重的提出四個問題。第一個問題，「以中國為戰塲，繼續犧牲下去，由此而迫成的當前之遭遇，究竟怎樣。其所引起之將來的隱憂，又怎樣。是否要在旣不能戰，又不能和的慘狀底下，白白的犧牲」。如今不過三個多月，遭遇已碰到了。隱憂也隨而加深了。這樣子白白的犧牲了，又犧牲所爲何來。我們知道各位對於這問題，曾經引起過一番討論局勢的，（二字電碼不明）大家不會不明白。所焦慮的是日本的態度，對「中日同盟條約」尊重我國獨立自主。一字一句，是否可以見諸實現，不會變更。我們於此，曾經不憚反覆，加以說明。如今看到日本政府的聲明，「惟在粉碎英美侵略之野心」，「渝方軍隊能拒絕與英美協力，亦認之爲友」，其所企求於我國的，爲本於中日同盟條約，及大東亞共同宣言，尊重我國之獨立自主，以完成東亞之永久友好關係。再看到日軍最高司令官告將七的布吿，一則日，「所攻擊之敵中，厥係英美，決非一般民衆」。再則曰，「諸君思鄕之心，實與湖南民衆愛鄕之情無異，深信諸君現在中國戰塲，爲完成戰爭，必能以愛自己之江山，與自已鄰人相愛之心，與湖南鄕村民衆接觸」，並列舉八大規戒，以為行動之標準。甚至對於民衆提產物，用具，購物，通貨，（一字電碼不明）伕役等等，亦不憚繁瑣，加以嚴正之約束。盟邦日本的眞意，於此更明白淸楚，無可疑義了。這是盟邦日本的根本方針，盟邦日本旣以保衛東亞，解放東亞的前鋒自任，對此根本方針，自不會有所變更，有所破壞。老實說，在日本方面，也是愛日本，愛東亞的，對此方針，不會有所變更，有所破壞。在中國方面，也是愛中國，愛東亞的，對此方針也必定不願其有所變更，有所破壞。要雙更，要破壞，而上日日在險謀的（一字電碼不明）使之變史，使之破壞的，祗有那妄想奴役中國，離開中日，肢解東亞之窮兇極惡的英美帝國主義，及其所豢養的，喪心病狂的別動隊。也許有人說道，旣然與我爲友，訂立同盟條約，爲什麼又要（三字電碼不明）那麼我們不能不反問，爲什麼重慶方面，當我們簽訂同盟條約的時候，不接受這個方針，促進和平，完成統一，使日本眞正之敵人，不復能假　中國的領土，作其戰塲，供其犧牲，使日本得以其兵力在太平洋方面，與茲美決戰，却要甘受什麼聞羅會議種種的唆擺，造成今日的慘局。唉，過去的巳經過去，也不必再提了，今日以後，又將怎樣呢？（待續）</p>

<h3>財部訓令銀錢業　應愼重放款用途　金價狂漲係有人操縱所致</h3>
<p>南京七日中央社電　最近京滬一帶金價狂漲，影響物價，關係民生至鉅。記者特以此事，往訪財政部負責人員，承見告如次：最近京滬一帶金價瘋狂上漲，各項物價咸以金市為伸縮中心，因此亦發生重大反鬱。據探悉，係因京滬一帶勢力雄厚之投機份子，對黃金市塲加以操縱所致，實為最大原因。因之造成近日金市狂漲之不安狀態，間接影響民星，關係匪淺。雖各地銀錢行莊，循法辦理業務者固多，但不顧國家法令，牟取厚利者亦關不少。本部有鑒於斯，特再重申前令，業已分別訓令京滬兩市銀錢業同業公會，轉飭各會員行莊，嗣後各地銀行錢莊之辦理放款業務，須依照前頒法令各項規定，慎重處置。其用途是否正當，尤須嚴密審查，倘有遠反規定，其資金運用於投機方面者，一經查實，定予從嚴懲處，不稍寬貸。一面並分令中央儲備銀行檢查金融事務處，轉飭所屬，一體嚴密偵查，分令各金融機關，對於放款業務，各循正軌辦理，藉以消滅投機，抑平物價，以安民生。</p>

<p>湖南前線日軍某基地七日中央社電　此次於華北華中華南展開之大陸作戰，其規模之宏大，與夫作戰之雄渾，為大陸戰史上所僅見，與以往屢次之作戰逈乎不同。第一，日軍自去年一月。實施對華新政策以來，同時日中國派遣軍於此次作戰中，已明顯表現其本來面目。自其作戰行動觀之，實含有甚多政治意義，與過去之作戰性格比較根本異其趣旨。第二，大陸方面日軍依然保持强大力量，渝方最精銳之胡宗南軍，始終未於日軍面前出現。又蕩思伯軍則自事變以來，即恐懼日軍痛擊，常隱置其主力。此次亦全被日軍包國殲滅，無論自任何方面觀之，此次所收戰果，實為大陸戰史上之最高紀錄。湖南戰錢日軍一舉佔領長沙醴陵，亦為大陸作戰史上所罕有。第三，純戰略的作戰，因日軍軍紀機整，乃得貫撤日軍常勝之作戰，即作戰之意旨，因與抗戰地區民眾接近，故日軍將士之一舉一動，彼等莫不感到有實現中日同盟條約之意義。日政府於五日發表聲明，謂日軍第一綫將兵，根本以中國民眾為友，即渝軍若不與英美協力，亦不以之為敵。中日事樊勃發，迄今正七年，大陸作戰性格已為之一變，實具有極深之意義云。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據渝軍當局發表湖南戰况如次：衡陽刻仍在繼續激戰中，自四日下午至五日中午之二十小時內，戰鬥之激烈，已達最高潮，目下仍在惡鬥中。渝軍頃在衡陽防掣綫極力反攻，刻已於永豐附近展開激戰中。</p>
<p>廣州七日中央社電　華南日派遣軍已於三日攻略淸遠縣城，並將該處之殘敗渝軍，完全肅淸。截至現在止，日軍所獲戰果，經判明者，計渝軍乘屍一三五員，被俘四一。此外日軍並或獲渝軍平射砲二門，平射砲彈一二〇發，輕機槍四挻，步槍四九挺，步槍彈丸九二〇發，其他軍需品無算。</p>
<p>美機改取游擊戰法</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地七日中央社電　此次日軍在中國各地發動作戰後，駐渝美空軍即喪失其西南空軍基地，被迫退至內地，處此情形之下，駐渝美空軍乃不得不放棄其白查空襲之戰法，而改取後方游擊戰法，專事在夜間擾亂日軍海上運輸路，並濫施轟炸。據最近所接消息，渝方曾開監山洞，建設桂林某飛機塲，及電波兵器室，在此兵器室內，美籍技師數人，常駐其間，以電流逐一報告日機出發基地之時間，來襲方向角度，及距離等。又據最近由擊落之敵機所傳消息稱，美偵察機亦裝置有電波反射器，在探知日機之動向云。由於美空軍之有組縱的利用上述各項機能，彼等當即能認淸日本附近基地之情况，及日機之起降，而把握進擊戰之機會。此外為探悉在海上航行中之艦船情形，更派遺裝備反射機之偵察機潛艇，及裝有無綫電幾之民船，分佈於中國沿岸，進行電波連絡任務，伺機滋擾後方。然而日方設備之優良，亦足以凌駕渝方，蓋渝機於接近時，日機即能於短時間內迅速採取邀擊態勢，同時亦能迅速窺知渝方基地之動向，並能利用電波科學戰，使駐渝天空軍出其意表，而獲致光榮之勝利云。</p>
<p>日軍半年綜合戰果</p>
<p>日軍前綫某基地七日中央社電　日軍自入本年以來，即到處展開掃蕩戰，故渝共兩軍總反攻之企圖，遂成泡影。茲將本年度上半期之綜合戰果誌次：交戰次數四零零，渝共兵力八九五八七，毀壞設施計有兵工廠九處，糧食倉庫被服廠二處，織物工廠二處，區公署一處。業屍五四零四具，俘或九四七。鹵獲迫擊砲二門，輕迫擊砲四門，同彈藥一三三發，自動步槍二挺，捷克式經機槍二四挺，步槍二六三三挺，同彈藥一五五六一發，地雷一三四枚。又上項戰果如與去年同期相較，則其交戰次數及其棄屍數字，實達二倍之巨。此足表示日軍作戰之積極及渝共抗戰力已日趨低下。</p>
<h3>菲律賓發表反駁聲明指摘美野望</h3>
<p>馬尼刺七日中央社電羅斯福六月三十日於議會對隹許菲律賓獨立之決議案簽名，對此，菲律賓大總統府曾於六日發表以下之反駁聲明，而痛烈指摘美國之野望，該聲明要旨要次：美國雖云准許菲國獨立，然菲國國民於既已宣告獨立之今日，美國無論作出如何法律與契約，亦無濟於事。且以政府機構之復歸常態與供作陸海空軍基地為條件，此仍不外企圖再度征服菲國。與使菲國成為戰塲。菲國國民對此問題，非僅不睬，且對美之無恥無能，更莫不為之啞然。菲國與盟邦日本相互協力，具有完遂今次大戰之責任，全國國民無論由如何方面，以如何之欺瞞與威脅手段臨之，亦絕不因之而屈服。</p>

<h3>克魯格無帥　戰績煊赫</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電此次新任之西歐德軍最高司令克魯格元帥，一九四〇年初夏於法關德爾突破作戰一役，曾樹立功黝。一九四一年出動東綫，於明斯克·斯摩倫斯克各地對蘇軍大包圍殲滅戰中，充分發揮機構戰術家之本能，更於去年蘇軍夏季攻勢之際，重創蘇軍，並由蘇軍結成之突角陣地整然撤退，實為德軍攻守自如之唯一名將。</p>

<h3>邱吉爾承認流星彈威力　勸倫敦市民疏散</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據倫敦電；邱吉爾六日曾在下院就德軍以流星彈攻擊英國事，聲稱，今日吾人如輕視此特殊攻擊方法，實屬錯誤，故英政府對此決未加以輕視。反軸心軍若不對法國實行轟炸，恐德軍對倫敦之流星彈攻擊，在六個月前即已熾烈展開。迄六日上午六時止，德軍已發射流星彈二千七百五十四發，英方傷亡實達二千七百五十二人，英國內諸般態勢必須適合軍事作戰計劃，英國斷不能使諾曼第作戰及對德國特殊目標之攻擊，發生任何齟齬，倫敦決不能為德軍征服。</p>
<p>瑞典京城七日中央社電　據倫敦電：英首相邱吉爾鑒於流星彈之威脅日甚，乃勸告無特殊任務之市民即時遷出倫敦，同時並開放禁止民眾進入之防空壕。</p>
<p>新武器襲英將變本加屬</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德軍事專家六日反駁英首相邱吉爾在下院關於流星彈之轟炸報告稱，邱吉爾此次演說中所發表之數字，亳不正確，與真相不符。德軍截至目下止，攻擊英國之流星彈數目，因屬軍機，未便發表，但決不止於邱吉爾所報告之二千餘發。邱士爾並謂流星彈平均重量為一噸，亦不正確，其重量已超出一噸有餘，既稱平均重量為一噸，一噸炸彈僅能炸斃一人，亦絕無人相信，一噸炸彈有如何之威力，德國民飽經轟炸已深知之矣。流星彈之轟炸，現尚未入本格階段，且砲彈之姓能亦逐日改良，今後對倫敦及英南部將更行如雨之轟炸，其第一目標即在短期內內轟炸英軍事地帶，其重量與反軸心軍投向德國及同盟各國之炸彈相同</p>

<h3>關於陳友仁先生的一個報吿</h3>
<p>— 李微塵</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>陳友仁先生殁後三日，火葬儀式剛完，我才開始惑到沉痛，徘徊不忍離去靜安寺墓園的時候，有些朋友便勸我寫一篇關於陳先生的思想言行的文章。當時，一樓白烟正從火化室的烟塔冉冉上升，隨風飛散。我仰望雲霄，痛念逝者，心潮起落，百感縈懷，想到成住懷空，萬念隨烟消逝。人生如夢亦如烟，有什麼好說！</p>
<p>過幾天，朋友們仍繼績前議。同時，另有些朋友更警實我徵集些文章，編印成冊，以為陳先生紀念。他們說：「像陳先生這樣一代的人物的死亡，應是熱鬧些，不應傑現在這樣寂寞」。這種見解，我不敢苟同。暴風雨後是寂寞的。無故掀風作浪，和故意漢漢熱鬧，徒使「弔者大悅」有什麼意義？</p>
<p>但最近，陳先生比校密切的幾位朋友和在哀痛中的陳夫人亦督責我寫文章。因為聽到外間一些關於陳先生很不正確的傳說，他們便要我負責作一個聲明，並主張我應儘可能解說陳先生這兩三年來的言行思想，免得被無聊的人們來附會利用，他們所聽到的、一種是懷疑陳先生的死是不正常的。這是沒有惡意的流言。另一種是現在有些人正在　托着陳先生的名義到處招謠說陳先生有一個「收拾時局的治國平天下策」，生前曾交給他們，並且曾付託他們依照這妙策，進行組織，從事活動。這倒是有作用的假托。為着這事，陳夫人尤為焦急，前幾天給我這樣的一封信「李先生：</p>
<p>你是我丈夫最後七年問的朋友和同事，我相信你對他是能充分瞭解的。凡有關於他的聲名或事實的不正確的宣傳，我授權給你代我否認和批駁。如認為必要，你得對他的言行思想，加以闡明或解釋。我將所有材料供你參考，你向來是被目為』政治上的異端者（Politicalhertic），我相信惟有「異端者」為著真實是敢開罪人的。陳張荔英六月二十三日」</p>
<p>我兩三年來決意不寫文章。這封信却使我不得不破戒。但我總以為對那些無聊的人們伸辯是無須要的。只有最低能和無聊得可憐的人們才肯去附會假托死人以自重一神是神，鬼是鬼，穿起蟒抱的小丑絕不會被人尊之為帝皇的」。因此我在這篇文章裹，只將陳先生晚年的事實，就可能範圍，忠資的和客觀的平舖直敘出來。如果我不能把晚年的陳先生繪出一幢惟肖惟妙的畫像，這或許是天色和畫室的周遭不大合乎理想的關係，或許我的瞭解還不够，或許我的技巧太低劣。這是我應向陳夫人陳先生的朋友們及國人先行告罪的。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>因為有些陳先生的死是不正常的，我應負責先消除這個不必要的誤會。同時，為使各地關懷陳先生的朋友們明瞭他病中和臨終的實况，我該將陳先生近幾年來健康的變化，臥病的經過，和易　時的情形，先作一個簡括的報告。</p>
<p>國人對陳先生的印象，總以為他不過是五十來歲的人，總想象不出他是會老的。這是陳先生前進的思想，富有熱力和挑戰性的言論，及充滿着靑年的果敢和不屈的革命戰鬥精神給人們的印象。同時，他的氣象丰采亦沒有一點兒像發老的人們。就是在死的寂靜中，他的肅穆的，寧靜的，遺容的表情還在使人們感到他仍是積極的，有動力的，前進的。可是他已經是六十九歲，照通常的算法，是七十古稀之年了。</p>
<p>陳先生的精神向來很飽滿，讀書，寫作，思維，談話終日無倦容。在民國二十七年懷着滿腔血誠由歐洲歸來奔赴國難的時侯，他的體格尤為結實。但到十月底廣州武漢相繼淪陷，我們每晚九時以後總是會面的，一燈義然，相對籌思，在這短短的一星期中，他是老了！面部肌肉緊張着！縐紋加深着！而發際亦斑白了！自那時起，身體亦漸漸淸减。憂能傷人，那不用說了。</p>
<p>但陳先生還是沒有病的。在太平洋戰爭爆發前十多年間他可以說是沒有病過。可是戰爭的環境終至於影響到他的健康。</p>
<p>「作始」是很微渺的。這是在天寒地凍的十二月二十一日或二十二日的晚上，在硝煙瀰漫着，空襲砲戰震撼着的香港。當時燃料無疑是缺乏的，熱水當然是沒有的。他潔凈的愛好却驅使去洗冷水浴，因此，他便感冒了風寒。不久香港隨陷，他被送到香港大酒店裹，蒙難幽居，病憂交襲。這是他的健康變化之始。</p>
<p>我常常想：日本軍當局對於被送到香港大酒店居住的人們是相當優待的。陳先生如果提出醫藥的要求，看守者想必一定允許。但陳先生的性格向來不肯求人，因此，他當時並沒有提出要求，只任病勢日然發展。到翌年三月二十五·六日，我在香港大酒店住了兩天，得管理人的許可，才得和陳先生會面。四月不見，生死莫明，這次晤對自然是喜悲交集，初時機乎說不出話來。我尚記得陳先生當日還是穿得很整齊精神還好，態度很安詳，但他更清減了！更老了！鬚髪稀疏了！完全都白了！當天，我們談了很久，他告訴我一切的經過和所決定的方針。臨別，他又口述他的遺囑。</p>
<p>四月底，我們到上海來。在夏秋之間，陳先生的健康彷彿恢復一些。但一到冬天，因沒有火爐的緣故，他又受了寒，旋瘉旋病，一連幾次，身體的抵抗力因此不免是削弱了。此外在去年三月因為某種激剌，他認為是不白之冤，更憤慨異常，益形消瘦，可是他的戰士的精神還比支持着，使人感不到他的體魄的微弱。</p>
<p>說到他最後病的經過，最初亦是和感冒風寒有關。由於風寒把他的抵抗力削减，別的病才得乘隙而作，才得乘樓發展。自去年底起，他曾受過好幾次凉，但隨起隨愈，他總以為是好了，不過還有一二度熱度退不淸。他只感到些疲倦，對於他讀書研究還沒有妨碍。</p>
<p>到四月初，熱度還常在華氏表九十九度上下經過種種醫學的檢驗，經（導許多專門名醫的診視和研究，才斷定了他所息的是剛在初期發展中的結核性腹膜炎。過了約二十天，結核菌便漫延到肺膜，但由於各醫師的醫治，到五月十日左右，腹膜炎和肺膜炎都减退了，腹部收縮了，熟度亦退了，而白血球亦由四千增加至六千，紅血球亦由三百五十萬增到至五百萬了。一切的一切都在證明他的病是很明確的踏上了痊愈的途程。我還記得陳先生當時自已撫摩着腹部，表露着滿意的欣慰。</p>
<p>但過一天，不幸又有新的變化，陳先生突然患著精神經衰弱病了。初時，各醫師頗慮到他的腦膜受了影響或結核菌已漫延到腦際。後經專家詳細檢氏，這些卻是細心的過慮，整個腦部都很正常。除了常常表露着欲睡不能的情態外，陳先生在當時實在沒有什麼不一舒適。有時，還很愛說話，並且說得異常起勁，侃侃而談到戰後我們國家的問題。</p>
<p>十六日以後變化較顯著，陳先生不大說話了，對一切都似乎漠不關心。偶然還微笑着，彷彿想安慰陳夫人才說幾句話。但所說的都是用法文，而不說英語了</p>
<p>陳先生的脈搏平案是比一般人跳動的快些，但他的心臟却很强。不料到十八日他的心臟又突然起了變化，當日他的情態彷彿是很不寧靜，聲天恢恢欲睡，但又不容易睡得着。直到十九日淸晨二時十五分，他才睡着了，並且是熟睡了。不料這使是陳先生在人世間的最後一次的熱睡！</p>
<p>以上是陳先生病的經過。</p>
<p>如今我該報告關結時的情形。百感難追人去後，我只好勉抑著情感作一個簡短的憶述，從十九日的下午說起。</p>
<p>上面說過，陳先生是在熱睡著。因此陳夫人便不好去驚動他，一直等到中午過後，才想去呌醒他飮一些已經預備好的肉汁。一連呌了幾次，陳先生總是睡著，總是不醒。陳夫人當時才開始表露著憂慮和焦冠，但還想象不到她的丈夫是從此一睡不醒了。</p>
<p>四五點鐘的時候，顏駿人先生來探病，他和陳夫人談了許久似乎給陳夫人不少的安慰和鼓勵。但臨別在花園的時候，他鄭重的對我說：「陳先生是老朋友，有什麼須要我帮忙，請不要客氣隨時通知我」。他這句話却道破了，却使我立即感到陳先生最後的關頭是接近了，我當時心情的難過是用不用着說的，但我還在希望着，還不肯失望。</p>
<p>當天下午，陳先生的脈搏己經是不大好。但看護還瞞着陳夫人，只有將實情報告醫師。而醫師來診視後說話亦很慎重，大概是不願增加陳夫人的憂慮和焦急</p>
<p>晚上十時左右，黃漢樣先生接到醫師的報告便立即到來。他便輕輕的向我說：「恐怕是不好了」。但他和我一樣都沒有勇氣將這消息告訴陳夫人。</p>
<p>十一時左右，黃逸慧林兆議和吳旭丹三位醫師都來了。他們診視了許多，討論了許久，才決定施行注射，後來又在討論着，結果終於向黃漢樣先生同我兩人宣佈：「陳先生是在逐漸的沉下去了」。（He　is　gradually　sunking）。但我們還鼓不起勇氣把這話告訴陳夫人。</p>
<p>到差不多一點鐘的時候，林醫師和吳醫師才走，黃醫師却留着。他很難過的對我們說：「現在是二三兩點鏡的問題了。」法時，陳夫人恰從隔壁陳先生病榻所在的臥室走進書房來，黃醫師那時却不得不向她宣佈：「如今只有靠陳先生自已了」。絕望的難過在剎那間彷彿是使空氣都沉重了，各人呼吸都窒息了。</p>
<p>但事已到此，黃漢樑先生便主張我通知陳夫人的姊姊張芸英女史，在哀痛的降臨中找一位親人陪陪陳夫人是須要的。到二時前後，張芸英女史和牠的丈夫陳壽務先生是來了，吉田東祐先生亦來了。我為什麼通知這位吉田先生呢？因為他是兩年前奉命從香港奉陪陳先生到上海的人。這兩年來，他對陳先生是無時無地不流露出誠擊的敬慕，而事實上亦常常表現出意外的帮忙，他的內心，我相信是瞭解陳先生的。</p>
<p>自那不曉上九時許起，陳先生雖在睡中，每隔二三十分鐘還咳嗽好幾次。而這些咳嗽卻給陳夫人很大的慰安和希望，她總以為她的丈夫快要醒來了。不料這些便是陳先生對人世間臨別的「馨欬」了。</p>
<p>一時以後，陳先生的呼吸漸漸吃力了。不久便漸漸稀薄了。到二時十五分，脈搏差不多是停息了。經黃醫師一再汪射後，呼吸才漸潮若斷若績的恢復過來。但不久便又稀薄了。終至三時零五分，在陳夫人撫摩着，微弱的呼喚着，這位前進的，富有動力的，剛毅果敢不屈的革呼戰士便寗靜的，肅穆的與世長辭。</p>
<p>「Destiny　is　cruel」（運命這麼殘酷）！在那一剎那間，我沒有眼淚，只沉悶着說了這句話。</p>
<p>但陳先在這次最後的病中，我還須報告，自起病到臨終始終沒有呻吟過。他是否完全沒有痛苦或有些痛苦，我無從得知。但我知道的，他是不肯受人氏的，同時亦不願使別人難過的，即使有痛苦，他總是忍耐着。</p>
<p>至於診視陳先生的病的醫師，除了上面曾說過的二一位外，還有屬誠滸，刁信德，和奧浦爾二位。他們和吳旭丹醫師一樣都是被邀請來研究施治陳先生的病的。各醫師，我敢肯定的說，無論在貢獻意見或施治方面，都已經盡了他們應盡及可能盡的力量了。人之云亡，有時亦非人力所能挽救，悲夫！（未完待續）</p>

<p>（甲）各種車輛應令其停排於不妨碍交通之地點。（乙）一般道行者應令址在這路兩旁都停排立。（丙）俟車關及一般通行者停排完全後，再聯過五分鐘，始行開放交通，汽車等車輛，在訓練警報發出時間內，其速度每小時應在二十公里以下，其他車輛及一般通行者，則在不妨碍交通範團內，准其順次通行。（丁）訓練警報發出時間內，汽車摩托車等刺八，除在不得已之情形下使用外，應嚴加取締其任意鳴次。</p>
<p>實施燈火管制</p>

<p>（甲）應實施與第一次及第二次警報發出時之同樣訓練。（乙）自夜間九時至十時半間全市實施燈火管制，問時在是項時間內，將路燈熄滅。（丙）對各種車關應實施燈火管制之取締，在日前警戒警報發出時，曾有多數脚踏車人力車及載貨事等，未燃點車燈者，又對减光遮光設備未盡妥善，而然點車燈，經警員及保甲人員之指斥，始行滅燈等情事，亦不在少數。故各該指導人員應指導各車主撈將滅光及遮光設備，裝置妥善後，令其燃點車燈為要。但在空襲警報發出時，則須熄滅車燈。（丁）警報發出時，對手電筒之遮光减光裝置，應實施取締，求其澈底。</p>
<p>音響交通管制</p>
<p>二，該日擬於軍幫協助之下，實仁以檢查各種自動車輛（汽車等）之警音器（喇叭）調節裝置，及燈光掩遮設備之有無。故設特別取締班分派於市內入處，俾期音饗管制及燈火管制之澈底。三，應利用保甲自警組織，指導全市民切實厲行「靠左邊走」。四，應隨時留意檢點露天攤販之是否妨礙交通及夜間燈光播遮設備情形，並實行其取締。五，綜合防空訓練。除前列各項訓絲及取締事宜外，各分局畏應視各該轄區之實際狀况，妥為實施，綜合防空訓練。六，在此届防空日實施訓練時，一應採取適合實戰的防空措置，務期達到圓滿之成績，</p>
<p>防空本部公告</p>
<p>據上海特別市市民防空本部另發公告云：關於防空訓練一事，在警戒警報發出以後，交通應如往昔之暫時停止五分鐘，過五分鐘以後，專轉及步行人仍准行動，但應以不妨一緞交通為原則。在空襲報發出以後，一切車浦必須完全停止，並停放在不妨礙交通之地點。同時一般步行人應即散開，就近尋覓避難所，人內探避十分鐘。其後如情形許可，祇行人交通當再予恢復。兩在空襲警報時，應極力避免馬路上有羣衆　集之情事。</p>
<h3>市民應密切注意　燈火管制</h3>
<p>關於敵在渝空軍，最近竟不斷向和平區內作卑劣之蠢動，盟邦日本在滬艦隊報道部，於昨午在陸海外聯合報道常會席上，深望上海民衆嚴密管制燈火，負責保衛大上海市鐵壁任務，復將防空管制燈火之設施及智識，特再作詳切之說明。茲分誌如次</p>
<p>防空理由</p>
<p>我人可對敵機空襲之企圖，可分如下之理由：</p>
<p>我敵美為欲避勉彼輩在中國大陸方面之航空基地遭受覆滅之命運，　企圖搗亂上海的和平，因此上海防空當局有鑒於斯，曾迭次告示關於防空興防空的解說，以指導市民，此即保護市民的生命財產，而市民防空本部亦盡力指導市民，惟猶未臻充分完備之境，如市民缺乏防空知識，萬一敵機來襲，將一定遭受極大的死傷與損失，此乃明顯的事實。故防空即為守衛自己，努力上海全都防空，即守衛上海的責任。</p>
<p>嚴防洩光</p>
<p>本市日本陸海軍防空當局，特於日昨（六八日）揭示重要佈告，對亳無關心防空之市民，作進一步之警告。其內容凡在發出空襲警報時，而仍有洩漏燈光者，當按照軍法嚴厲懲處。查警報發出時，不使燈光外洩，此乃最便當區容易所能做到的，且亦即為最重要的任務。按敵機在黑色中，光棧即為唯一之目標。故凡有燈光洩瀾之住房，即有被敵轟炸，且將連累附近遭殃，此點上海市民應深切注意。再將過去敵棧轟炸狀况詳誌如下，以作參考。當敵機投下炸彈之前，並無一定目標，且輩亦不能辨別地區之重要，即以光綫為　，故我人更應避免光洩戶外，為最緊要的任務。</p>
<p>嚴密注意</p>
<p>根據現在上海警戒訓練靠沿馬路兩旁屋房尚佳，惟在房屋有空隙之每戶，滿以為光綫可看不出，依仍燃放電燈，但在平地上雖不能見有漏覺，然在屋頂上則光亮甚為明顯，是在空中向下觀察，尤為淸晰，故以此等住戶，其本人猶作隱瞞曚欺，轄境指導機關及自警團以其存心不良，故今後對於燈光外洩，及光綫上漏，更應嚴密注意，如再燈光管制不完備時，有違反規則者，除予停電處分外，並按照軍法嚴厲處罰，希望市民格外注意。</p>
<h3>米價暴漲　當局澈查操縱深望市民勿為利用</h3>
<p>本市食米搬入，自米統會遵照「京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要」，及「上海市民食米管理暫行辦法」之規定，公佈徵購食米辦法，於七月一日起實施以來，本市米價突又上漲，以致人心惶惶。記者為此趨訪米統會當局，承答無：「最近實施徵購辦法後，米價暴漲，一般人多歸咎於徵購實施及其價格之太低，惟根據實价統計，自七月一日至四日，徵購總數雖為無幾，但無論其徽購價格低至何種程度，苟無奸商利用一般心理，乘機操縱，又安能影響米價若是之巨，現除對操縱米價之奸商嚴予查緝外，深望一般市民，信賴政府既定政策及其一切措置，切勿庸人自擾，為奸商利用，則米價當可安定云」。</p>
<h3>南市加緊　防空演習</h3>
<p>本市第二警察總局為促使南市全區之防空週密，與加緊訓練自警團員，戢止地方恐怖事件起見，先後實施防空及恐怖演習，茲將各情分誌於後，如有因違反燈火管制，均將懲處，實施停止重流供應，是以昨晚在警吸警報中，該區燈火悉告掩靜，較之過去更臻完密。昨日南市全區在第二警察總局防空指揮部督導之下，該區三警察分局，先後展開防空演習，凡交通滅火救滅等工作，由各該分局各別主持演習，結果無論動作技術，確已獲有長足之進展。南市邑廟警察分局並於昨日午後六時起在邑廟始告終止，交通亦即恢復</p>
<h3>泰山區　恐怖演習</h3>
<p>泰山區於昨（七日）下午三時在大興路　　大戲院門口，舉行大規模恐怖演習，有假想恐怖犯三人，在該處拋機似型炸彈後，當由崗警電報泰山分局，派遣大批警探，將全區封鎖，同時該管滬南區日憲兵及駐軍，均到塲兜捕恐怖犯，至四時許三假想犯人先後向獲，始告竣事，解除封鎖，恢曰復交通，同時其他各區，亦有是項演習。</p>
<h3>出淵部長披瀝　日軍作戰目標　殲滅中國大陸敵英美勢力</h3>
<p>盟邦在滬陸軍部報道部出淵部長，昨（七日）下午在陸海聯合報道常會席上，會見本市中國記者時，特就最近大陸作戰戰况及目的，加以深切之說明。茲誌部長談話如下：出淵部長首謂在衡陽作戰之件質，與攻擊洛陽之戰相同。頃日陸軍之進行，大部完成，已在衡陽展開市內作戰。故衡陽之陷落，即在眉睫，日內即可明曉，而攻擊衡陽之重大戰果，亦已期待將臨。查渝第九戰區司令長官薛岳　下計有三十師國兵力，被日軍擊破大部，目前僅不足三師團之實力，被擊潰之二十七師團敗卒，出律破裂不堪，頗難較復原有之狀態，而日軍方面仍不斷整理陣容，且努力保養實力，進備在下期再展開作戰，因此，渝軍實無法可施反攻之舉。大本營發表，華南派遣軍自上月二十七日起，又開始作戰行動，已攻人渝第七戰區。並佔領淸遠從化，龍門諸地，在與第九戰區作戰之日軍相互呼應下，猛烈進擊中。查粵漢鐵路全綫一千一百公哩，在此距關巾，日軍遒未佔領者僅三百公里而已。關於此次大陸作戰之意義，日昨經日政府發表鄭重聲明，披瀝作戰目標，尤為明顯，使諸君已深　無遺，故日軍在華南及豫淅之作戰目的，殲滅在中國大陸之敵英美　勢，打破英美使略東亞之野心，故在世界戰爭歷史上，日本已發揮道義的精神，此外，在目而猶在進行中之太平洋作戰及緬甸作戰，其目　　與大陸作戰，完全相同。</p>
<h3>北江西路　恢供電</h3>
<p>本市目實施防空以來，日臻完善，惟間有少數居民對於燈火管制仍屬疏忽，如日前北江西路一帶，於警報發出後，仍有少數住戶燈光外，洩致為該管警局查悉，乃於上月十九日將上述地點，一概停供電流，以示懲戒。茲悉該區自停止供電後，保甲人員即按戶切實彻導，將各窗牖及電燈予以嚴密遮蔽，務使嗣後燈光不致外油，聞各住戶均已切實導行，業經該管警局派員調查屬實，於六日通知電力公司，恢復供電，嗣後各區住戶，封於燈火尤須謹愼，勿蹈前　。</p>
<h3>第七趕發購布證</h3>
<p>本市第七區公署，此次配給境內棉布購買證，係按二月份戶口統計配發，凡本年二月底以前還人之住戶，會報請警局及坊公所登記戶口之居民，均可領得購布訊。惟為防止舞弊，不使遺漏及發生冒領起見，飭屬妥愼辦理，并製定棉布配給申請書，交各坊長按級層轉各戶，將戶口確數塡明，分別蓋章，彙呈該署查核無訛照發。據悉第七區境內共五坊計五十三個聯保，有八萬七千三百二十餘戶，四十萬零九千五百餘人，均須嚴寗審查，本可於二月配發完竣，因居民填呈之申請書不照規定手續，經查核不符者極多，致延日期，聞該區公署全體職員正漏夜趕辦審核，預計下星期內可告竣。</p>
<h3>遊園演講會　定今日舉行　六時半起在哈同花園</h3>
<p>市民遊園演講大會，在上海新聞聯合會主船下，定於今日下午六時半在哈同花園舉行，大會主席團為尾坂與市·許力求，陳彬龢·金雄白·　敬層·袁袁殊·森山需·吳慈齋·總幹事任雲鵬，大會節目繁多，為媧去任何演華會放一異彩。聞馬內除對似有績帶之來賓外，概不設座，同時應付盛者起見，特在園內設有冷飲部，來實隨時可購，六時半開始進塲遊園，七時開始演議會。又中華電影公司，特派員在塲攝製新聞片。</p>

<h3>松島部長談　太古洋戰況　美隊遭驚人損失</h3>
<p>盟邦日本艦隊報導部長松島大佐，昨（七日）午在陸有外聯合報道常會席上，就最近太平洋戰况一般情形，特發表談話如</p>
<p>狼狽遁走</p>
<p>松島部長首謂，敵機動部隊自犯襲小笠原羣島及琉黃島各地，經守備該所在地之日軍暨航空部隊，在協力奮戰下，敵軍已狼狽遁走，且從該地起迄至　班島一帶之海面，已無敵軍機動部隊存在。惟敵猶自不量力，將一部份之艦艇，仍向　　　繼續會同陸上戰鬥部隊，作孤注一擲。查敵方自六月十一日起至六月杪止，不惜抽調太平洋艦嚴之大部份，改向日本內綫羣犯，在此二十天中，劇戰結果，敵美繼艇所受損害，被日軍繫沉者連四十八艘以上，飛機已遲六百六十五架之多，同時並在陸上又遭受軍大之損害，敵美海軍部長福來斯特，於本月五日對專班島之作戰，承認所受損害，已出於意料之外，是以日海軍之作戰巧妙，在誘致戰略下，噸使敵美艦隊深遭驚人之損害</p>
<p>大言不慚</p>
<p>於茲敵太平洋艦隊大部己被擊沉擊破，維動餘殘艦，架信猶在夏威夷或馬紹爾各島作修理補充之企圖。查日本神勇海軍，雖獲此偉大戰果，刻仍繼續養精蓄銳，期待殘敵補充完畢後，再行來犯，予以重新之打繫。而諸君欲特別認淸者，頃美海軍已遭受極大之損害，此外關於海上艦艇之損害補充，與陸上部隊截然不同，頗難似陸上裱旈之便速，由此敵海軍當局頗為慌急，故難怪福來斯特於五日發表之談話中，承認離海戰之前途太遙。同時福氏所發表之載址錯誤，誠為大言不慚，詭稱在軍班島附近擊沉擊破日海軍艦船有六六四艘之說，我人對此，既不問美國民性之如何，而該負責海軍長官者竟狂發此類囈語，實不勝驚異。</p>
<p>嚴防洩光</p>
<p>旋又就上海防空問題，特加以詳切之說明，謂日陸軍在華中方面，獨得重大成功後，美在渝空部嚴，深為焦急，最近為施「牽制」伎倆，竟積極迭向和平區方面活動，故我人應特別注意彼等覓利用明月朗淸之時期，有所鬼慧，因此深盼上海市民作進一步之注意，嚴密管制燈火，同時陸海當局亦特示布告，在今後燈火管制時，不得洩露燈光，如敢故逮除停止供給電流外，並將按照軍法嚴處。以是深望上海市民，應本身負起保衛上海市之責，盡任自己管制之能力，此點本人特深切期望上海市民所應加以做到者。</p>

<h3>調整上海民食辦法我見了</h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>上海市區產米數量，迭據各方統計，最稍爲民國二十四年之十九萬二千餘石，最多爲民國三十年之二十三萬三千餘石，平均每年產量不過二十萬石。而市區內華人總數，約三百二十萬而不足。假定小孩佔全數四份之一，並以大人每日食米六合，小孩每日食米三合計算，則每年消耗量當在六百二十九萬石，至六百萬石之間，供需相抵，每年不足數量，常在五百入十萬石至六百萬石左右，勢非仰賴他方輸人，無從挹注。</p>
<p>自本（民國三十三）年五月二十四日行政院公佈京滬兩市民食米臨時措置要網，六月一日上海特別市政府及米糧統制委員會公佈上海市民食米管理暫行辦法以後，對於上海市民戶口米，米統會抑若不再負責，須待農民或採辦商販米抵滬後，再行統壽，而其配給價格，雖云照收貢價　酌予减低計算，但較之昔晶配給價格，自將增高不少，自此兩項辦法公佈後，羣情惶惑，不可終日，益以投機者之操縱，大戶之杰購，米價扶搖而上，不可響邇。五月二十五六日，滬地黑市米價，尙在六千元關內一石者，至六月二三晶間，狂漲至一萬三千元一石，漲風之烈，前所未有，滬上大多數人民，均屬薪水階級，月人而達萬元標準者，能有幾何，且即有萬元收入矣，不過僅數購米之需，其他一切開支，將可謂已達焦頭爛額，山窮由搬運人口，既無歡量限制，且不徵購軍米，米價方趨回跌。但自七月一日米統會實施徵購勤法以後，又復激漲。決非一般市民所能勝貝，茍不妥籌善策，不特民不堪命，即整個社會，將有崩潰之虞，時　對於前兩項食米管理辦法，評論已多，但對於具體辦法，迄未有所指陳，而當局除令飭登記米商成立採辦組外，對於如何能推行盡利，似亦總確定辦法，用敢不揣固陋，略陳所見：</p>
<h3>疏通米糧來源</h3>
<p>由採辦商向產米縣份採購　欲求此一辦法之生實效，尚有不少困難須待克服，良以上海民食，固極恐慌，而各縣產米，亦有限度，採辦商雖持正式護照前往，但各縣是否樂予合作，頗滋疑問，故手續方面，應注意實施下列四項：</p>
<p>甲·由政府通令三有兩市，轉飭所屬，凡京滬採辦米商，有正式護照前往購米者，應准其通融採辦，至於採購數量，似應根據統計，通籌有無，俾於接濟上海民需之餘，仍能兼顧當地需要。</p>
<p>乙·採辦米糧，務須從速，採辦商資木，除自願以個人（或公司）資金採購者外，應由市府及糧統會轉商銀行貸款以利進行，庶幾採辦之米，得以存諸指定公倉。</p>
<p>丙·值此戰爭期間，軍運孔亟，米糧運輸，不無困雜。應由政府嚴令所屬，無論水陸運輸，除軍運外，應由米糧先運，如能獎勵航遝業務，减少不必要之客遝，俾得增加運輸能力，以維民食，尤爲切要。</p>
<p>丁·自原則言，應禁止單帮米商之行動，而自實際言，則滬市民食之維持，事帮米商之力量，至爲偉大。蓋單帮米商均爲利往，由於單帮米商之居間，運輸旣屬有限，而成本及爲提高，故自原則言，應予禁止，但在政府，無確定辦法，米糧不能大量運滬前，單幫米商，又爲接濟滬市民食之大功臣也。</p>
<p>調整滬市民間所有食糧　滬市民間存糧雖無確切統計，但以殷賓居民甚多，積榖防饑事理之常。益以大戶奸商，囤積操縱，存糧定不在少。爲救急計，不妨先行移用，以爲配給戶口米之需，其辦法如下：</p>
<p>甲·收購存糧根據米統會第十二號通告：「民食米存量，以三個月爲限，逾量作囤積論。」則凡民間存糧，超過三個月者，自可即日收購，以充民需。其間尚有應予解釋者，即每人每月貪米數量，並無規定，不無無所適從之苦，值茲戰時，不妨轉定每人每月以一斗五升爲限，大小平均，當可勉敷需要。</p>
<p>乙·收購價格　收購民間存糧價格，自當按照成本，再加百分二十之利潤計算，一切不妨從寬，俾人民樂於出售，但較之市價，當可便宜不少。再收購價款，務須從速淸償，切勿遷延時日，自失信用。</p>
<p>丙·應實成保甲調查具報各方存糧，不易周知，際此靑黃不接，米價日昻之際，而求人民踴躍出售，談何容易，惟有責成保甲，切實調查具報，併由經濟警察，負覆查之責，如有故違，從級懲處，如能將收購於民者，亦用之於民，自能獲得大多數人民之擁獲也。</p>
<h3>收購米糧機構</h3>
<p>收購米糧機構之一元化　即此後滬地收購米糧，應有一負責之機構，如由糧食管理局負實，則米統會不妨取消，如由米統會負責，則糧食局亦應歸併，不特所屬機構如採辦組及米糧同業公會籌備委員會職轍混淆難淸，即上海糧食調整委員會及華中米榖配給組合，變應悉予合併，而後事權方能統一，責任亦有攸歸。</p>
<p>人事問題　糧政關係民食，人事更應嚴格甄別。此後糧政機構，應如何調整，因常局之專責，非局外人所得過問，但對於人事間題，務須慎重銓衡，切勿再蹈覆轍。</p>
<p>監察問題　自實施統制經濟以後，以主持者權力至大，可以態斷一切，舞嘴機會亦較多，非有嚴密之監察機構，不易收防制之功效。再則亂世應用重與，決不宜多所姑息，徒自貽伊戚。上海市政諮詢委員會建議組織監察委員會，實爲當務之急。</p>
<h3>其他問題</h3>
<p>設法維待戶口米在此過渡時間，戶口米之配給，務須設決維持，則米價方有低落之望。</p>
<p>廢除苛什　上海米糧，所以較內地高出不少者，原因雖不止一端，而軍警之勒索，苛什之騷擾，亦為重要原因之一，殊有從速取締必要。</p>
<p>食糧節約　值此危急存亡之秋，應勸告人民實行節約食糧，或使用雜糧代替，藉以勉渡難關。</p>

<p>眨眼間，這一年又過去了·而一九四一年來了。這並感覺不到是普涌的新年，因爲在紀元二千六百年的上面，又需要加上一個一字，所以全體國民都感覺到定將開始什麼新的前途。日本皇軍，不僅在巾國大陸上耀武協威，傳佈國家的德信，而且在法屬安南也有確駐兵了。在歐洲，德國業已取得絕對優勢的軍事支配樣了。而日美通商條約的廢棄，不僅業已發生效力，而且羅斯福在新年獻詞時，曾聲明將充分援助民主國家。終是住在公寓斗室內的牟田口隆夫，心中也想翻開軍艦照片，而臨撲英美的主力艦了。</p>
<p>眞人常常來信，信中雖說，太平洋風雲愈益緊急，但具體一點的話，一句也沒有說。此外只是字裹行問充滿着軍人的決心與希望，以及鼓勵隆夫的話。</p>

<p>海國美術協會是從兩三年前，每年春天召開一次海洋畫展覽會的，所以隆夫也會去參觀過，但因全是漁村和燈塔之類的海洋風景，所以大失所望。今年正想去參觀，但還沒有動身。</p>
<p>隆夫以爲寄請帖來了，所以迎忙打開信對。但從裏面並非是印刷品，而是長長的一封毛筆信</p>

<p>隆夫驚奇得幾乎跳起來。自己並未有出品的盡，反經過審查，將請求海軍大臣嘉獎，當然是要驚奇的。</p>

        <h1>1944.07.08</h1>
<h3>Contributing to the General Association of Commerce</h3>
<p>There are two ways to control the economy: one is for the government to implement control through administrative power; the other is for the people to implement control with a spirit of self-governance. As far as our China is concerned, the current National General Association of Commerce is adopting the latter approach, with the private industrial and commercial sectors forming autonomous control organizations, and the government only playing a role of supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>In order for the control work based on the principle of self-governance by the people to achieve the benefits of control as expected, three conditions must be met: the first condition, which is also the most necessary, is "the morality of merchants." The so-called "spirit of self-governance" is based on moral concepts, because those who participate in commercial control work should in principle be purely business people. If they lack the moral concept of merchants, there is simply no spirit of self-governance to speak of. Without the spirit of self-governance, it is difficult to obtain the benefits of control. Moreover, control is still in its infancy in China, with no regulations to follow and unfamiliar to the public. Therefore, if handling is not done properly, it will not only be unprofitable but also easily lead to the opposite phenomenon of harming the people. Therefore, the morality of merchants is indeed the most fundamental condition for the current control work in our country. As for the content of merchant morality, the scope is very broad, and the most important thing is that under the wartime controlled economy, the public interest of the wartime state should come first, and the private interests of individuals or a few should come later.</p>
<p>The second condition is that those participating in control work should be limited to people from the industrial and commercial sectors. Since it is a commercial self-governing organization, it should of course be limited to merchants. If non-merchants participate, it is easy to gradually form a bureaucratic organization, which will inevitably lose the meaning of commercial self-governance. For example, rice control work should be undertaken by rice merchants, but in fact, many are not rice merchants, thus forming a bureaucratic organization. There are many phenomena that deviate far from reason in the measures taken, which make the rice problem increasingly serious, and it continues to deteriorate, like trying to untangle silk by adding more knots.</p>
<p>The third condition is that society should have the power of sanction. For the control work, if loopholes are discovered, or if there are unreasonable measures, and it is predicted that they will hinder the wartime economy and people's livelihood, society should exert its power to strictly criticize, correct, sanction, and eliminate obstacles, and promote rationalization. However, in the past, the power of social sanction has not been fully exerted. Although there have been some sanctions in public opinion, they have not been easily valued by the authorities and have not achieved the effect of sanction. For example, in the work of the Rice Control Association, there have been loopholes and various unreasonable measures in the past. Although various newspapers, especially this newspaper, have strictly criticized them, they have not been humbly adopted by the authorities in the end. The control work in the past, as a whole, it is no exaggeration to say that failures outweigh successes, especially the rice control work, which was a complete failure. Recently, the General Association of Commerce has been adjusted, and five committees have been set up under it to implement control work, while the Mountain General Association of Commerce reviews and supervises in terms of vertical organization and connects and integrates in terms of horizontal organization. We hope that the General Association of Commerce must exert its own power and responsibilities to the fullest, pay special attention to the spirit of commercial self-governance, and value the necessary conditions that should be possessed in the current stage of control work. At the same time, we would like to make the following suggestions regarding the actual work of the General Association of Commerce:</p>
<p>The five control committees under the General Association of Commerce, namely rice and grain, cotton, flour and wheat, oil and grain, and daily necessities, should be consistent in terms of organization, personnel, and facilities, and there should be no phenomenon of deviating from the General Association of Commerce and acting independently. The most urgent task at present is that the Rice Control Association should be reorganized as soon as possible and the winding up should be handled. After the reorganization is sound, it should focus all its efforts on preparing for the autumn harvest control plan, which should be complete, thorough, reasonable, and not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth control work will be merged with the cotton control work, and the organization should be sound as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the internal organization of the General Association of Commerce, there is a planning department, which can be said to be the nerve center of the General Association of Commerce, which is extremely important, and should absorb as many specialized talents as possible to undertake planning work. Among the commercial groups in Shanghai, there are many with decades of history, and there are many talents with rich experience and familiarity with commercial habits. The General Association of Commerce can extend invitations to borrow them. As for those who are eager to seek connections from various sources, they must not have appropriate talents, and should especially be rejected, so as to become a model commercial self-governing organization where everyone has talent and every talent is used, so that control becomes work that is beneficial to the wartime state and beneficial to the wartime people's livelihood.</p>

<h3>East Asia Literature Conference to Be Held in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The third conference of Greater East Asian writers was originally scheduled to be held in Nanjing, the capital of China, but was postponed due to various reasons. After consultation by the parties concerned, it is proposed to be held in Nanjing this autumn.</p>
<h3>Spokesman for the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Talks, Urging Chongqing to Reflect as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The spokesman for the Greater East Asia Ministry made the following remarks to the press corps on the 7th: The imperial statement issued on the 5th has clearly stated that the goal of the current Chinese operation is to crush the ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States to dominate Greater East Asia. The operation of the Japanese army has implied that the first priority is to block the counter-offensive of the Chongqing army. Once a good opportunity arises, it will launch a fierce offensive in the Pacific. At this critical moment, Chongqing should understand that it is a member of Asia, and that the United Kingdom and the United States are the common enemies of Greater East Asia. The Chongqing army is willing to be a lackey of British and American imperialism and is hesitant on the road of resistance. In the future after the war, China will still be unable to escape from being a semi-colony of the United Kingdom and the United States. The so-called "resistance to oppress the country" is actually "resistance to destroy the country" or "resistance to sell the country." The intellectuals within Chongqing are all worried about the future of China. It is quite questionable whether the United Kingdom and the United States will have the sincerity to fulfill the existing agreements after the war. A review of the history of British and American aggression against China will make it clear in a day. Looking at the cold and cruel self-interest situation of treating the exiled Western European regimes, it is very clear. The Chongqing elements must also have some concerns about this point. Whether China should be subordinate to the British and American world hegemony should be reflected upon again and again. Chongqing should deeply understand the historical lessons of the past, seriously understand the original intention of Greater East Asia's co-existence and co-prosperity, and reflect quickly.</p>
<h3>Lin Propaganda Director Broadcasts to Chongqing "Striving for an Active Way Out"</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - "To all officers and soldiers, comrades, and compatriots in Chongqing:</p>
<p>When I am about to open my mouth to talk to you on the radio, an uncontrollable emotion surges into my heart. Thinking of the situation in Pinghan and Yuehan, what I see in my eyes seems to be piles of old and new graves. What I hear in my ears seems to be With this mood, what else can I say? But I deeply know that your mood is no different from mine. After all, I have to say a few words.</p>
<p>In the Battle of Changsha, many officers and soldiers sacrificed. Among them were my classmates from middle school. He was a passionate young man and a general from Huangpu. In addition, there are many officers and soldiers that I know or do not know. Like him, they are passionate young people, and like him, they have sacrificed. Why did they have to sacrifice like this? For the United Kingdom and the United States? They are young people who have been tempered in the revolutionary climax. Anti-British and anti-Americanism has been his consistent ambition since he joined the revolutionary movement. Why sacrifice for the United Kingdom and the United States? For the Communist Party? They are young people who have shed blood and tears in the anti-communist struggle for the past fifteen or sixteen years. Why sacrifice for the Communist Party? For the motherland... (unclear telegraph code) The war of resistance that has changed its nature, the war of resistance that is manipulated and fooled. Only by cutting off the vitality of the nation-state can it no longer be delayed, but they have sacrificed after all. Why did they sacrifice in such an unclear way?</p>
<p>In March of this year, in an article entitled "Reiterating Our Position," I solemnly raised four questions. The first question, "What is the current situation forced by continuing to sacrifice in China as a battlefield? What are the hidden worries that it will cause in the future? Is it necessary to sacrifice in vain in the tragic situation of neither being able to fight nor being able to make peace?" Now, only three months later, the encounter has been encountered. The hidden worries have also deepened. What is the point of sacrificing in vain like this? We know that you have had some discussions about the situation on this issue. (two-character telegraph code unclear) Everyone will not fail to understand. What is worrying is the attitude of Japan, respecting our country's independence and autonomy in the "Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty." Whether every word can be realized without change. We have repeatedly explained this. Now that we see the statement of the Japanese government, "only to crush the ambitions of British and American aggression," "the Chongqing army can refuse to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States, and it is also recognized as a friend," what it seeks from our country is based on the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, respecting our country's independence and autonomy, in order to complete the permanent friendly relations in East Asia. Then we see the bulletin of the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army, which says, "Among the enemies attacked, it is the United Kingdom and the United States, not the general public." Then it says, "Your desire to return to your hometown is no different from the love of the Hunan people for their hometown. I believe that you are now on the Chinese battlefield. In order to complete the war, you must treat the Hunan villagers with the love of your own country and the love of your neighbors," and lists eight major precepts as the standard of action. Even for the people's supplies, equipment, shopping, currency, (one-character telegraph code unclear) corvée, etc., it does not hesitate to be cumbersome and impose strict restrictions. The true intention of the allied country Japan is even more clear and unmistakable here. This is the fundamental policy of the allied country Japan. Since the allied country Japan takes it upon itself to be the vanguard of defending East Asia and liberating East Asia, it will not change or destroy this fundamental policy. To be honest, on the Japanese side, it is also loving Japan and loving East Asia. It will not change or destroy this policy. On the Chinese side, it is also loving China and loving East Asia. It will definitely not want this policy to be changed or destroyed. To change, to destroy, and to make it change history and destroy it every day, there are only the extremely evil British and American imperialists who want to enslave China, separate China and Japan, and dismember East Asia, and their crazed special forces. Perhaps some people say that since you are our friends and have signed an alliance treaty with us, why do you have to (three-character telegraph code unclear) Then we cannot help but ask in return, why did Chongqing not accept this policy, promote peace, and complete reunification when we signed the alliance treaty, so that Japan's real enemy could no longer use China's territory as its battlefield and provide its sacrifices, so that Japan could use its military force in the Pacific to fight a decisive battle with the United States, but instead willingly accepted the various instigations of the Menlo Park Conference and created today's tragedy. Alas, the past is already in the past, and there is no need to mention it anymore. After today, what will happen? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Instructs Silver and Money Businesses to Be Cautious in Lending Purposes, Soaring Gold Prices Are Due to Manipulation</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The recent soaring gold prices in Beijing and Shanghai have affected commodity prices, which is of great importance to people's livelihood. The reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Finance for this matter, and was told the following: The recent skyrocketing gold prices in Beijing and Shanghai have made various commodity prices the center of expansion and contraction in the gold market, thus causing major adverse effects. According to investigations, it is due to the fact that powerful speculators in Beijing and Shanghai have manipulated the gold market, which is the biggest reason. This has created the recent unstable state of soaring gold prices, indirectly affecting the people's livelihood, which is of great importance. Although most of the silver and money houses in various places handle their business in accordance with the law, there are not a few who disregard national laws and seek huge profits. In view of this, the Ministry hereby reiterates its previous order and has separately instructed the Silver and Money Business Associations of Beijing and Shanghai to instruct their members to handle loan business in the future in accordance with the various provisions of the previously promulgated laws and regulations, and to handle it carefully. It is necessary to strictly review whether the purpose is proper. If it is found that the funds are used for speculation in violation of regulations, they will be severely punished and no leniency will be shown. At the same time, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank was ordered to strictly investigate, and various financial institutions were ordered to follow the correct track in handling loan business, so as to eliminate speculation, suppress commodity prices, and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Operations Deeply Imbued with Political Significance: Japanese Forces in South China Capture Qingyuan</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the Hunan front, dated the 7th: The scale and vigor of the current mainland operations launched in North China, Central China, and South China are unprecedented in the history of mainland warfare, differing greatly from previous operations. First, since January of last year, when the Japanese military implemented its new China policy, the Japanese China Expeditionary Force has clearly demonstrated its true colors in these operations. Judging from their combat actions, these operations contain significant political implications, fundamentally different from the nature of past warfare. Second, the Japanese military in mainland China still maintains a strong force. Hu Zongnan's most elite troops of the Chongqing regime have consistently avoided confronting the Japanese military. Furthermore, Tang Enbo's troops have been fearful of Japanese attacks since the incident, often concealing their main forces. This time, they were completely surrounded and annihilated by the Japanese military. From any perspective, the results achieved are the highest record in the history of mainland warfare. The Japanese military's swift capture of Changsha and Liling on the Hunan front is also rare in the history of mainland operations. Third, purely strategic operations, combined with the Japanese military's discipline and precision, have resulted in the continuous success of the Japanese military. The intent of the operations is to connect with the people in the resistance areas, so that every action of the Japanese soldiers is perceived as realizing the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty. The Japanese government issued a statement on the 5th, stating that the Japanese frontline soldiers fundamentally regard the Chinese people as friends, and will not treat the Chongqing troops as enemies unless they cooperate with Britain and the United States. The Sino-Japanese conflict has been ongoing for seven years, and the nature of mainland warfare has been completely transformed, carrying profound significance.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 7th: According to the Chongqing military authorities, the situation in Hunan is as follows: Fierce fighting continues in Hengyang. The intensity of the battle reached its peak within the twenty hours from the afternoon of the 4th to noon on the 5th, and fierce fighting continues. The Chongqing troops are exerting all efforts to counterattack along the Hengyang defense line, and intense battles are currently underway near Yongfeng.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Guangzhou, dated the 7th: The Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force captured Qingyuan County on the 3rd, completely clearing out the remaining defeated Chongqing troops. As of now, the confirmed results of the Japanese military's operations are as follows: 135 Chongqing soldiers killed, and 41 captured. In addition, the Japanese military seized two Chongqing army flat-trajectory guns, 120 flat-trajectory gun shells, four light machine guns, 49 rifles, 920 rifle bullets, and countless other military supplies.</p>
<p>American Aircraft Adopt Guerrilla Tactics</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the front line, dated the 7th: After the Japanese military launched operations in various parts of China, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing lost its southwest air bases and was forced to retreat inland. Under these circumstances, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing had no choice but to abandon its tactics of white-day air raids and adopt rear-area guerrilla tactics, specializing in disrupting Japanese maritime transportation routes at night and carrying out indiscriminate bombings. According to recent news, the Chongqing side has opened surveillance caves to build an airfield and radio wave weapons room in Guilin. Several American technicians are stationed in this weapons room, reporting the time of departure, direction, angle, and distance of Japanese aircraft one by one using electrical currents. According to recent news from a downed enemy aircraft, U.S. reconnaissance aircraft are also equipped with radio wave reflectors to detect the movements of Japanese aircraft. Through the organized use of the above functions, they can immediately understand the situation of nearby Japanese bases, as well as the takeoff and landing of Japanese aircraft, and seize the opportunity for attack. In addition, in order to detect the situation of ships sailing at sea, they also dispatch reconnaissance aircraft and submarines equipped with reflectors, as well as civilian ships equipped with wireless radios, distributing them along the Chinese coast to carry out radio wave communication missions, waiting for opportunities to disrupt the rear. However, the superior equipment of the Japanese side is sufficient to surpass the Chongqing side. When Chongqing aircraft approach, Japanese aircraft can quickly adopt an interception posture in a short period of time, and can also quickly detect the movements of Chongqing bases, and can use radio wave warfare to surprise the air force stationed in Chongqing, achieving glorious victories.</p>
<p>Japanese Military's Comprehensive Combat Results for Half a Year</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese military base on the front line, dated the 7th: Since the beginning of this year, the Japanese military has launched sweeping operations everywhere, so the attempt of the Chongqing and Communist forces to launch a general counteroffensive has become a pipe dream. The comprehensive combat results for the first half of this year are recorded as follows: 400 engagements, 89,587 Chongqing and Communist troops killed or captured, destroyed facilities including 9 arsenals, 2 food warehouses and clothing factories, 2 textile factories, and 1 district government office. 5,404 bodies left behind, and 947 captured. Captured 2 mortars, 4 light mortars, 133 rounds of ammunition, 2 automatic rifles, 24 Czech-style light machine guns, 2,633 rifles, 15,561 rounds of ammunition, and 134 landmines. Moreover, if the above combat results are compared with the same period last year, the number of engagements and the number of bodies left behind have doubled. This is sufficient to show that the Japanese military's operations are active and the Chongqing and Communist resistance forces are declining daily.</p>
<h3>Philippine Statement Refutes and Accuses American Ambitions</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Manila, dated the 7th: On June 30th, Roosevelt signed the resolution of Congress authorizing Philippine independence. In response, the Philippine Presidential Office issued the following rebuttal statement on the 6th, severely criticizing American ambitions. The main points of the statement are as follows: Although the United States claims to grant the Philippines independence, any laws or contracts made by the United States today, when the Philippine people have already declared independence, are of no avail. Moreover, to make the restoration of government institutions and the provision of land, sea, and air force bases as conditions, this is nothing more than an attempt to conquer the Philippines again and make the Philippines a battlefield. The Philippine people not only ignore this issue but are also dumbfounded by the shamelessness and incompetence of the United States. The Philippines cooperates with its ally Japan and has the responsibility to complete this great war. The people of the whole country will never succumb to any deception or threat.</p>
<h3>Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association Holds a Meeting of Representatives: Focus on Current Affairs Issues</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 7th: The regular meeting of representatives of the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association was held at the headquarters at 2 p.m. on the 6th. President Abe, Secretary-General Maeda, State Minister Ohama, and 253 others attended, with current affairs issues as the focus of discussion. Fifteen councilors frankly expressed their political opinions, saying that the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the only political organization in our country, is determined to dedicate itself to the country, support the imperial family, and save the current situation. President Abe and Secretary-General Maeda immediately replied that the concerns raised by the councilors had been conveyed to the government as the general intention of the political association. The government is now striving to realize it in its entirety. Chairman Yamazaki also said that the general intention of the councilors should be integrated into the general intention of the representatives. The entire meeting immediately unanimously passed the motion and decided to appoint Chairman Yamazaki to handle it, adjourning at 4:30 p.m. It is reported that the general intention of this meeting of representatives will be conveyed to Prime Minister Tojo by President Abe and Secretary-General Maeda within one or two days. The general intention of the meeting of representatives is that, under the current situation, the country should establish a unified system, and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association must strive to achieve it.</p>

<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: The newly appointed Supreme Commander of the German Army in Western Europe, Marshal Kluge, established his military achievements in the battle of breaking through France at the beginning of the summer of 1940. In 1941, he moved to the Eastern Front and fully demonstrated his instinct as a mechanization tactician in the large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles against the Soviet army in Minsk and Smolensk. Furthermore, during the Soviet summer offensive last year, he severely damaged the Soviet army and orderly withdrew from the bulge formed by the Soviet army. He is truly the only famous general in the German army who can attack and defend freely.</p>

<h3>Churchill Acknowledges the Power of the Meteor Bomb and Urges Londoners to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, dated the 7th: According to a London dispatch: Churchill stated in the House of Commons on the 6th regarding the German attacks on Britain with Meteor bombs that it would be a mistake for us to underestimate this special attack method today, so the British government has never taken it lightly. If the anti-Axis forces did not bomb France, the German Meteor bomb attacks on London would have been fiercely launched six months ago. As of 6 a.m. on the 6th, the German army had launched 2,754 Meteor bombs, and British casualties totaled 2,752 people. All aspects of the situation in Britain must be suitable for military operations plans. Britain cannot allow any discord to occur in the Normandy operations and attacks on special German targets. London must not be conquered by the German army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, dated the 7th: According to a London dispatch: In view of the increasing threat of Meteor bombs, British Prime Minister Churchill has advised citizens without special missions to evacuate London immediately, and has also opened air-raid shelters previously forbidden to the public.</p>
<p>New Weapons Attacking Britain Will Become More Intensive</p>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Berlin, dated the 7th: On the 6th, German military experts refuted British Prime Minister Churchill's report in the House of Commons on the bombing of Meteor bombs, saying that the figures released by Churchill in his speech were completely incorrect and did not correspond to the truth. The number of Meteor bombs launched by the German army against Britain to date cannot be released due to military secrets, but it is definitely more than the 2,000 or so bombs reported by Churchill. Churchill also said that the average weight of a Meteor bomb is one ton, which is also incorrect. Its weight already exceeds one ton. It is also unbelievable to say that an average weight of one ton, a one-ton bomb can only kill one person. The German people, who have been heavily bombed, already know the power of a one-ton bomb. The bombing of Meteor bombs has not yet entered the proper stage, and the performance of the shells is improving daily. In the future, London and southern England will be bombed even more like rain. The first goal is to bomb British military areas within a short period of time, and its weight is the same as the bombs dropped on Germany and allied countries by the anti-Axis forces.</p>
<h3>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Visits Bulgarian Authorities</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Sofia, dated the 7th: Transocean News Agency reports: Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Bulgaria, Kirsanov, visited Bulgarian Prime Minister Bagrianov and yesterday visited Foreign Minister Draganov again. Soviet Ambassador Lavrishchev is still in Moscow.</p>
<h3>A Report About Mr. Chen Youren</h3>
<p>— Li Weichen</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Three days after Mr. Chen Youren's death, just as the cremation ceremony had concluded and I began to feel a deep sense of sorrow, lingering and reluctant to leave the Jing'an Temple cemetery, some friends advised me to write an article about Mr. Chen's thoughts and actions. At that moment, a wisp of white smoke was slowly rising from the chimney of the crematorium, dispersing with the wind. I looked up at the sky, grieving for the deceased, my heart surging with a mix of emotions, thinking about the cycles of formation, existence, destruction, and emptiness, and how all thoughts vanish like smoke. Life is like a dream, like smoke, so what is there to say!</p>
<p>A few days later, my friends continued their earlier proposal. At the same time, other friends urged me to collect articles and compile them into a book as a memorial to Mr. Chen. They said, "The death of a figure like Mr. Chen should be a grand occasion, not the lonely affair it is now." I could not agree with this view. After a storm, there is silence. What is the point of needlessly stirring up trouble and deliberately creating a clamorous spectacle, just to make "the mourners rejoice"?</p>
<p>Recently, however, several of Mr. Chen's close friends and Mrs. Chen, in her grief, have also pressed me to write an article. They had heard some very inaccurate rumors about Mr. Chen and wanted me to issue a statement and explain Mr. Chen's words, deeds, and thoughts over the past two or three years, to prevent unscrupulous people from seizing upon them and exploiting them. One rumor they heard suggested that Mr. Chen's death was not normal. This was a harmless piece of gossip. Another rumor claimed that some people were invoking Mr. Chen's name to spread falsehoods, claiming that Mr. Chen had a "strategy for restoring order and governing the country," which he had entrusted to them before his death, tasking them with forming an organization and carrying out activities according to this brilliant plan. This was a useful fabrication. Mrs. Chen was particularly anxious about this matter and wrote me the following letter a few days ago: "Mr. Li:</p>
<p>You were my husband's friend and colleague for the last seven years, and I believe you understand him fully. I authorize you to deny and refute any inaccurate publicity regarding his reputation or facts. If you deem it necessary, you may clarify or explain his words, actions, and thoughts. I will provide all materials for your reference. You have always been regarded as a 'political heretic,' and I believe only a 'heretic' dares to offend people for the sake of truth. Chen Zhang Liying, June 23rd."</p>
<p>For the past two or three years, I had resolved not to write articles. This letter, however, forced me to break my vow. But I always believed that there was no need to argue with those unscrupulous people. Only the most incompetent and pitiable people would try to elevate themselves by attaching themselves to the dead. "A god is a god, and a ghost is a ghost. A clown dressed in imperial robes will never be revered as an emperor." Therefore, in this article, I will simply present the facts of Mr. Chen's later years as truthfully and objectively as possible. If I cannot paint a lifelike portrait of Mr. Chen in his later years, it may be due to unfavorable lighting and surroundings in the studio, or perhaps my understanding is insufficient, or my skills are too poor. I apologize in advance to Mrs. Chen, Mr. Chen's friends, and the nation for this.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Because some believe that Mr. Chen's death was not normal, I should take responsibility for dispelling this unnecessary misunderstanding. At the same time, to help friends of Mr. Chen in various places understand his condition during his illness and at the time of his death, I should first provide a brief report on the changes in Mr. Chen's health in recent years, the course of his illness, and the circumstances at the time of his passing.</p>
<p>The public's impression of Mr. Chen is that he was no more than fifty years old, and they cannot imagine him growing old. This is due to Mr. Chen's progressive ideas, his passionate and challenging speeches, and his youthful courage and indomitable revolutionary spirit. Moreover, his demeanor did not resemble that of an aging person. Even in the stillness of death, his solemn, serene expression still made people feel that he was active, dynamic, and forward-looking. But he was already sixty-nine years old, or seventy by the traditional count, the age of "rare antiquity."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's spirit was always strong, and he never seemed weary from reading, writing, thinking, and talking all day long. When he returned from Europe in 1938, full of blood and sincerity, to rush to the nation's aid, his physique was particularly robust. But by the end of October, when Guangzhou and Wuhan fell in quick succession, we would meet every evening after nine o'clock, under a dim light, and ponder together. In that short week, he aged! The muscles in his face tightened! The wrinkles deepened! And his hairline turned gray! From then on, his body gradually thinned. Worry can hurt people, needless to say.</p>
<p>But Mr. Chen was still not ill. In the ten years or so before the outbreak of the Pacific War, he could be said to have never been sick. But the war environment eventually affected his health.</p>
<p>The "beginning" was very subtle. It was on the evening of December 21st or 22nd, in the freezing cold, amidst the smoke and the air raid bombardments of Hong Kong. At that time, fuel was undoubtedly scarce, and hot water was certainly unavailable. His love of cleanliness, however, drove him to take a cold shower, and as a result, he caught a cold. Soon after, Hong Kong fell, and he was sent to the Hong Kong Hotel, where he lived in confinement, suffering from both illness and anxiety. This was the beginning of the change in his health.</p>
<p>I often think that the Japanese military authorities were quite lenient to those sent to live at the Hong Kong Hotel. If Mr. Chen had requested medical attention, the guards would surely have allowed it. But Mr. Chen's character was such that he never asked for favors, so he did not make a request at the time, and allowed his illness to develop naturally. On March 25th or 26th of the following year, I stayed at the Hong Kong Hotel for two days and, with the permission of the manager, was able to meet with Mr. Chen. After not seeing each other for four months, with no certainty of life or death, this meeting was naturally filled with both joy and sorrow, and at first we were almost speechless. I still remember that Mr. Chen was dressed neatly that day, his spirits were good, and his manner was very peaceful, but he was thinner! Older! His beard and hair were sparse! And completely white! We talked for a long time that day, and he told me everything that had happened and the policies he had decided on. Before parting, he also dictated his will.</p>
<p>At the end of April, we came to Shanghai. During the summer and autumn, Mr. Chen's health seemed to recover somewhat. But in the winter, due to the lack of a stove, he caught a cold again, and relapsed repeatedly. His body's resistance was inevitably weakened. In addition, in March of last year, due to some kind of provocation, he felt wronged, and became even more indignant, and grew even thinner. But his warrior spirit still supported him, so that people did not feel the weakness of his body.</p>
<p>Speaking of the course of his final illness, it was initially related to catching a cold. Because the cold reduced his resistance, other illnesses were able to take advantage and develop. Since the end of last year, he had caught several colds, but he recovered each time. He always thought he was better, but his temperature was still one or two degrees above normal. He only felt a little tired, which did not hinder his reading and research.</p>
<p>At the beginning of April, his temperature was still around 99 degrees Fahrenheit. After various medical examinations, and the diagnosis and research of many specialized physicians, it was determined that he was suffering from tuberculous peritonitis in its early stages of development. After about twenty days, the tuberculosis bacteria spread to the pleura. But thanks to the treatment of the physicians, by around May 10th, the peritonitis and pleurisy had subsided, his abdomen had shrunk, his fever had gone down, and his white blood cell count had increased from 4,000 to 6,000, and his red blood cell count had increased from 3.5 million to 5 million. Everything proved that his illness was clearly on the road to recovery. I still remember Mr. Chen stroking his abdomen at the time, expressing satisfaction and relief.</p>
<p>But a day later, unfortunately, there was a new change. Mr. Chen suddenly suffered from neurasthenia. At first, the doctors were quite concerned that his meninges had been affected, or that the tuberculosis bacteria had spread to his brain. After a detailed examination by specialists, these concerns proved to be unfounded; his entire brain was normal. Apart from often expressing a sleepy but unable to sleep state, Mr. Chen really did not feel uncomfortable at that time. Sometimes, he loved to talk, and he talked with extraordinary enthusiasm, speaking eloquently about the problems of our country after the war.</p>
<p>After the 16th, the changes became more noticeable. Mr. Chen did not talk much and seemed indifferent to everything. Occasionally, he would smile, as if trying to comfort Mrs. Chen and say a few words. But what he said was always in French, not English.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's pulse was usually faster than most people's, but his heart was very strong. Unexpectedly, on the 18th, his heart suddenly changed. On that day, he seemed very restless, always sleepy, but unable to fall asleep easily. It was not until 2:15 a.m. on the 19th that he fell asleep, and it was a deep sleep. Little did we know that this was the last time Mr. Chen would sleep peacefully in this world!</p>
<p>The above is the course of Mr. Chen's illness.</p>
<p>Now I should report on the circumstances of his passing. With a thousand emotions difficult to chase after the person has departed, I can only suppress my feelings and offer a brief recollection, starting from the afternoon of the 19th.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Mr. Chen was sleeping soundly. Therefore, Mrs. Chen did not want to disturb him and waited until after noon before trying to wake him up to drink some broth that had been prepared. She called him several times, but Mr. Chen remained asleep and did not wake up. At that time, Mrs. Chen began to show worry and anxiety, but she still could not imagine that her husband would sleep soundly forever.</p>
<p>Around four or five o'clock, Mr. Yan Junren came to visit him. He talked with Mrs. Chen for a long time and seemed to give Mrs. Chen a lot of comfort and encouragement. But when leaving in the garden, he solemnly said to me, "Mr. Chen is an old friend. If there is anything I need to help with, please do not hesitate to notify me at any time." His words revealed the truth and made me immediately feel that Mr. Chen's final moment was approaching. The sadness of my mood at that time goes without saying, but I was still hoping and unwilling to despair.</p>
<p>That afternoon, Mr. Chen's pulse was already not good. But the nurse hid the truth from Mrs. Chen and only reported the actual situation to the doctor. And the doctor spoke very cautiously after the consultation, probably not wanting to increase Mrs. Chen's worry and anxiety.</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock in the evening, Mr. Huang Hanyang received a report from the doctor and immediately arrived. He gently said to me, "I'm afraid it's not good." But he and I both lacked the courage to tell Mrs. Chen this news.</p>
<p>Around eleven o'clock, Doctors Huang Yihui, Lin Zhaoyi, and Wu Xudan all came. They examined him a lot, discussed it for a long time, and then decided to administer an injection. Later, they discussed again, and finally announced to Mr. Huang Hanyang and me: "Mr. Chen is gradually sinking." But we still couldn't muster the courage to tell Mrs. Chen this.</p>
<p>Around one o'clock, Dr. Lin and Dr. Wu left, but Dr. Huang stayed. He said to us sadly, "Now it's a matter of two or three hours." At that time, Mrs. Chen happened to walk into the study from the bedroom next door where Mr. Chen's sickbed was located. Dr. Huang had no choice but to announce to her: "Now it depends on Mr. Chen himself." The despairing sadness seemed to make the air heavy in an instant, and everyone's breathing suffocated.</p>
<p>But since things had come to this, Mr. Huang Hanliang suggested that I notify Mrs. Chen's sister, Ms. Zhang Yunying. It was necessary to have a relative accompany Mrs. Chen in the face of the impending grief. Around two o'clock, Ms. Zhang Yunying and her husband, Mr. Chen Shuwu, arrived. Mr. Yoshida Tosuke also came. Why did I notify this Mr. Yoshida? Because he was the one who had been ordered two years ago to accompany Mr. Chen from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Over the past two years, he had always expressed sincere admiration for Mr. Chen, and in fact had often provided unexpected help. I believe his heart understood Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>From about nine o'clock that evening, Mr. Chen, although asleep, coughed several times every twenty or thirty minutes. And these coughs gave Mrs. Chen great comfort and hope. She always thought her husband was about to wake up. Little did she know that these were Mr. Chen's farewell "gentle coughs" to the world.</p>
<p>After one o'clock, Mr. Chen's breathing gradually became labored. Soon it gradually became thin. At 2:15, his pulse was almost stopped. After repeated injections by Dr. Huang, his breathing gradually and intermittently recovered. But soon it became thin again. Finally, at 3:05, while Mrs. Chen stroked him and weakly called out to him, this progressive, dynamic, resolute and indomitable revolutionary warrior quietly and solemnly passed away.</p>
<p>"Destiny is cruel"! In that instant, I had no tears, and only muttered this sentence.</p>
<p>But I must also report that during Mr. Chen's final illness, from the onset to his death, he never groaned. Whether he had no pain at all or had some pain, I have no way of knowing. But what I do know is that he refused to receive help from others and did not want to make others sad. Even if he was in pain, he always endured it.</p>
<p>As for the doctors who consulted on Mr. Chen's illness, in addition to the ones mentioned above, there were also Doctors Zhou Chengxu, Diao Xinde, and O'Pu'er. They, like Doctor Wu Xudan, were invited to study and treat Mr. Chen's illness. I can say with certainty that all the doctors have done their best, both in contributing opinions and in administering treatment. The passing of a person is sometimes beyond the power of human effort, alas! (To be continued)</p>

<p>According to an announcement by the Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in addition to various air defense drills on the seventh Air Defense Day on July 9th this year, the sound and traffic control regulations stipulated in Announcement No. 24 of the Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Command must be strictly enforced. Three training alert alarms will be issued on that day, and sirens will be sounded three times at the specified times. The alarm times are as follows:</p>
<p>First time: 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM.</p>
<p>Second time: 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM.</p>
<p>Third time: 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>During the first and second alarm periods, all vehicles must be strictly controlled, and they should be parked in locations that do not obstruct traffic. Pedestrians should be guided to stand quietly on both sides of the road. Traffic will only be resumed after vehicles and pedestrians have come to a complete standstill for five minutes. Motor vehicles may proceed at speeds not exceeding 20 kilometers per hour, and other vehicles and pedestrians may also continue to advance within the limits that do not hinder air defense work. Drivers of all motor vehicles are urged to pay special attention and refrain from excessive use of horns during training alert periods unless absolutely necessary. During the third alarm period, in addition to conducting other air defense drills, special attention will be paid to light control. During this time, from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, all streetlights will be turned off. In addition, the lights of bicycles, rickshaws, and other vehicles will also be strictly controlled. On that day, military authorities will be consulted to inspect whether the horns and headlights on automobiles are too powerful during alerts, and adjustments will be made accordingly.</p>
<p>Planned Activities</p>
<p>The activities planned by the authorities to be held on that day are detailed as follows: 1. Training alert alarm issuance time and cancellation time:</p>
<p>(The alarm issuance time and cancellation time will be conveyed by sounding sirens.)</p>
<p>Category Alert Alarm Issuance Time Alert Alarm Cancellation Time</p>
<p>First time 10:00 AM 10:30 AM</p>
<p>Second time 3:00 PM 3:30 PM</p>
<p>Third time 9:00 PM 10:30 PM</p>
<p>Major training matters when the first and second training alert alarms are issued:</p>
<p>(A) All vehicles should be ordered to park in locations that do not obstruct traffic. (B) Pedestrians should be ordered to stop and stand on both sides of the road. (C) Only after vehicles and pedestrians have stopped completely for five minutes will traffic be reopened. During the training alert alarm issuance time, the speed of automobiles and other vehicles should be below 20 kilometers per hour. Other vehicles and pedestrians will be allowed to proceed in order within the scope that does not obstruct traffic. (D) During the training alarm issuance time, the arbitrary use of car and motorcycle horns should be strictly prohibited, except under unavoidable circumstances.</p>
<p>Implementation of Light Control</p>
<p>Major training matters when the third training alert alarm is issued:</p>
<p>(A) The same training as when the first and second alarms are issued should be implemented. (B) Light control will be implemented throughout the city from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM, and streetlights will be turned off during this time. (C) Crackdown on light control for all types of vehicles. During previous alert alarms, many bicycles, rickshaws, and cargo vehicles did not have their lights on, and there were also many cases where the dimming and shielding equipment were not properly installed, and lights were only turned off after being pointed out by police officers and Baojia personnel. Therefore, the guidance personnel should instruct all vehicle owners to install dimming and shielding equipment properly, and instruct them to turn on the lights. However, when an air raid alarm is issued, the lights must be turned off. (D) During the alarm issuance, the shielding and dimming devices of flashlights should be strictly controlled to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Sound and Traffic Control</p>
<p>2. On that day, with the assistance of the military, inspections will be carried out to check the warning devices (horns) and adjustment devices of various motor vehicles (automobiles, etc.), and the presence or absence of light shielding equipment. Special crackdown teams will be assigned to various locations in the city to ensure thorough sound control and light control. 3. The Baojia self-defense organization should be used to guide all citizens to strictly implement "keep to the left." 4. Attention should be paid at all times to check whether open-air stalls are obstructing traffic and whether the night-time light shielding equipment is in good condition, and crackdown should be implemented. 5. Comprehensive air defense training. In addition to the aforementioned training and crackdown matters, each sub-bureau should carefully implement comprehensive air defense training based on the actual conditions of its jurisdiction. 6. When implementing training on this Air Defense Day, all air defense measures suitable for actual combat should be adopted, so as to achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Air Defense Headquarters Announcement</p>
<p>According to another announcement issued by the Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters: Regarding air defense training, after an alert alarm is issued, traffic should be temporarily stopped for five minutes as in the past. After five minutes, cars and pedestrians will still be allowed to move, but it should be on the principle of not hindering traffic. After an air raid alarm is issued, all vehicles must be completely stopped and parked in locations that do not obstruct traffic. At the same time, pedestrians should immediately disperse and seek nearby shelters for ten minutes. Afterwards, if the situation permits, pedestrian traffic should be restored. During air raid alarms, every effort should be made to avoid crowds gathering on the roads.</p>
<h3>Citizens Should Pay Close Attention To Light Control</h3>
<p>Regarding the enemy's recent base and contemptible movements toward the peaceful area by the air force in Chongqing, the press division of the Japanese Fleet in Shanghai, at the joint press conference between the army and navy yesterday afternoon, deeply hoped that the people of Shanghai would strictly control lights and responsibly protect the iron wall mission of the Greater Shanghai city. The light control facilities and knowledge of air defense control were explained in detail again. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Reasons for Air Defense</p>
<p>We can classify the enemy's attempts to carry out air raids as for the following reasons:</p>
<p>Our enemy, the United States, in order to avoid the fate of having their air bases in mainland China destroyed, is attempting to disrupt the peace in Shanghai. Therefore, the Shanghai air defense authorities, in view of this, have repeatedly issued announcements regarding air defense and air defense explanations to guide citizens. This is to protect the lives and property of citizens, and the Citizen Air Defense Headquarters is also making every effort to guide citizens, but it has not yet reached a fully complete state. If citizens lack air defense knowledge, they will certainly suffer great casualties and losses in the event of an enemy air raid, which is an obvious fact. Therefore, air defense is to defend oneself, and striving for air defense throughout Shanghai is the responsibility of defending Shanghai.</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Light Leaks</p>
<p>The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities in this city issued an important announcement yesterday (the 8th) to further warn citizens who are completely indifferent to air defense. The content is that anyone who still leaks light when an air raid alarm is issued will be severely punished in accordance with military law. Checking that no light is leaking when an alarm is issued is the easiest and most convenient thing to do, and it is also the most important task. According to enemy aircraft, light is the only target in the darkness. Therefore, any house with light leaks will be bombed by the enemy, and the surrounding area will also be implicated. The people of Shanghai should pay close attention to this point. The past enemy bombing situation is detailed below for reference. Before enemy aircraft drop bombs, they do not have a fixed target, and they cannot distinguish the importance of the area, that is, they use light as the goal, so we should avoid light leaks as the most urgent task.</p>
<p>Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>According to the current Shanghai alert training, the houses along both sides of the road are still good. However, in each household with gaps in the houses, they think that the light is invisible, and they still turn on electric lights. Although no leaks can be seen on the ground, the light is very obvious on the roof. It is even clearer when viewed from the air, so these households are still concealing and deceiving themselves, and the jurisdictional guidance agencies and self-defense groups consider them to have bad intentions. Therefore, in the future, more attention should be paid to light leaks and light leaks, and those who violate the rules when light control is incomplete will be punished by power outages and severely punished in accordance with military law. I hope the citizens will pay extra attention.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soar: Authorities Thoroughly Investigate Manipulation, Deeply Hope Citizens Will Not Be Used</h3>
<p>Since the Rice Control Committee followed the regulations of the "Temporary Measures for Rice for Citizens in Beijing and Shanghai" and the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Rice for Citizens in Shanghai" and announced the method of requisitioning rice, which has been implemented since July 1st, the price of rice in this city has suddenly risen again, causing panic. The reporter visited the Rice Control Committee and was told, "Recently, after the implementation of the requisitioning method, the price of rice soared, and most people attribute it to the implementation of the requisitioning and its excessively low price. However, according to actual price statistics, the total amount of requisitioning from July 1st to 4th was very small. No matter how low the requisitioning price is, if there are no unscrupulous merchants using general psychology to take the opportunity to manipulate prices, how could it affect the price of rice so greatly? In addition to strictly investigating and cracking down on unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices, we deeply hope that the general public will trust the government's established policies and all its measures, and do not disturb themselves needlessly and be used by unscrupulous merchants, then the price of rice can be stabilized."</p>
<h3>Nanshi Intensifies Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>The Second Police Headquarters of this city, in order to promote thorough air defense in the entire Nanshi area, intensify training of self-defense corps members, and suppress local terrorist incidents, has successively implemented air defense and terrorism drills. The details of each situation are recorded below. Those who violate the lighting control will be punished, and the supply of electricity will be stopped. Therefore, last night, during the police siren, all lights in the area were extinguished, making it more complete than in the past. Yesterday, under the supervision of the Air Defense Headquarters of the Second Police Headquarters, the three police stations in the Nanshi area successively launched air defense exercises. The traffic, fire extinguishing, and rescue work were all directed by the respective police stations. As a result, significant progress has been made in both action and technique. The Yimiao Police Station of Nanshi City also started at 6 p.m. yesterday in Yimiao and ended the drill, and traffic was restored immediately.</p>
<h3>Taishan District Terrorism Drill</h3>
<p>The Taishan District held a large-scale terrorism drill at the entrance of the Daxing Road Grand Theater at 3 p.m. yesterday (the 7th). Three simulated terrorists threw bombs resembling explosives at the location. The police officer on duty immediately telegraphed the Taishan Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to blockade the entire area. At the same time, the Japanese military police and garrison in the nearby Hunan District also arrived at the scene to arrest the terrorists. By about 4 p.m., all three simulated criminals had been captured, and the exercise concluded. The blockade was lifted, and traffic was restored. Similar exercises were also held in other districts at the same time.</p>
<h3>Minister Izumi Reveals Japanese Military's War Objectives: Annihilate Enemy British and American Forces on the Chinese Mainland</h3>
<p>Minister Izumi of the Army Reporting Department of the Allied Powers in Shanghai met with Chinese reporters from this city at the Joint Army and Navy Reporting Conference yesterday (the 7th). He provided a thorough explanation of the recent situation and objectives of the mainland operations. The minister's remarks are recorded as follows: Minister Izumi first said that the nature of the operation in Hengyang was the same as the battle to attack Luoyang. The ongoing operations of the Japanese army are largely complete, and urban combat has already begun in Hengyang. Therefore, the fall of Hengyang is imminent and will be known within days, and significant results from the attack on Hengyang are expected to come soon. It has been found that Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Zone of Chongqing, had 30 divisions of national troops under his command, but most of them were defeated by the Japanese army. Currently, he has a force of less than three divisions. The defeated soldiers of the 27 divisions are in disarray and unlikely to return to their original state. The Japanese army continues to reorganize its ranks, maintain its strength, and prepare to launch another operation in the next stage. Therefore, the Chongqing army has no way to launch a counterattack. The Supreme Headquarters announced that the South China Expeditionary Army began its operational activities on the 27th of last month, and has attacked the Seventh War Zone of Chongqing, occupying Qingyuan, Conghua, Longmen and other places. In coordination with the Japanese troops fighting in the Ninth War Zone, they are launching fierce attacks. It has been found that of the entire 1,100 kilometers of the Yuehan Railway, only 300 kilometers have not yet been occupied by the Japanese army in this area. Regarding the significance of this mainland operation, the Japanese government issued a solemn statement yesterday, revealing the war objectives, which is very clear and has already been deeply understood by everyone. Therefore, the Japanese military's operational objective in South China and Henan-Zhejiang is to annihilate the enemy British and American forces on the Chinese mainland and to shatter the British and American ambition to dominate East Asia. Therefore, in the history of world wars, Japan has demonstrated a spirit of righteousness. In addition, the objectives of the ongoing Pacific operations and the Burma operations are completely the same as the mainland operations.</p>
<h3>North Jiangxi Road Power Resumes</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of air defense in this city, it has become increasingly perfect. However, a small number of residents are still negligent in lighting control. For example, in the North Jiangxi Road area, after the alarm was issued, a small number of households still had lights exposed, which was discovered by the local police station. Therefore, on the 19th of last month, the electricity supply to the above-mentioned locations was suspended as a punishment. It is now known that after the power supply was stopped in the area, the Baojia personnel conducted thorough guidance from house to house, strictly shielding all windows and lights to ensure that the lights would not be exposed in the future. It is heard that all households have earnestly followed the guidance. The local police station has sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the power company was notified on the 6th to restore the power supply. In the future, residents in all areas must be careful about lights and avoid repeating the previous mistakes.</p>
<h3>Seventh District Expedites Issuance of Cloth Purchase Certificates</h3>
<p>The Seventh District Office of this city is distributing cotton cloth purchase certificates based on the household registration statistics for February. All households that resided in the area before the end of February of this year, and have reported their household registration to the police station and Fang office, can receive the cloth purchase certificate. However, in order to prevent fraud, avoid omissions, and prevent impersonation, the office has ordered careful handling, and prepared a cotton cloth allocation application form, which is given to each Fang chief to forward to each household by level. The exact number of household members is to be filled in, stamped separately, and submitted to the office for verification before issuance. It is reported that there are a total of five Fang, totaling 53 Lianbao, with more than 87,320 households and more than 400,950 people in the Seventh District. All must be strictly examined. The certificates could have been distributed in February, but the application forms submitted by the residents did not follow the prescribed procedures, and many were found to be inconsistent after verification, which delayed the date. It is heard that all staff of the district office are working overtime to expedite the review and approval process, and it is expected to be completed within the next week.</p>
<h3>Garden Lecture Meeting Scheduled for Today Starting at 6:30 PM at the Hardoon Garden</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Garden Lecture Meeting, under the sponsorship of the Shanghai News Federation, is scheduled to be held at the Hardoon Garden at 6:30 PM today. The presidium of the meeting consists of Osakato Ichishi, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binhe, Jin Xiongbai, Jing Ceng, Yuan Yuanzhu, Senyama Xu, and Wu Cizhai. Ren Yunpeng is the general director.

It is heard that aside from guests with special invitations, there will be no seating provided. In order to accommodate the large number of attendees, cold drink stands will be set up in the garden, and attendees can purchase drinks at any time. The garden will open at 6:30 PM, and the lecture meeting will begin at 7 PM. In addition, the China Film Company will send special personnel to the scene to film newsreels.</p>
<h3>Readers' Scholarship News</h3>
<p>Regarding Examinations and Screening</p>
<p>The seventh session of application and recommendation forms for this newspaper's reader scholarship has now been gradually submitted by various schools. The office will begin reviewing and registering them from the 11th. Each school should collect the receipts and come to pick them up, and distribute them to the students by the 15th or on a self-determined date. Regarding the screening methods: For initial screening, a small number of applicants have scores that do not meet the standards, or have acceptable family circumstances, or are in ineligible grades (primary school), so they must be screened first. These ineligible students will not be registered, and only their names will be notified to the school. If there are photos attached, they will also be returned to the schools. Regarding the examination, the unified examination will be held after July 20, which has already been announced. Generally, students in elementary and junior high school can finish the examination within the month, while students in high school and the first year of university will be postponed to the beginning of next month. A few schools have requested that the examination scope be announced, but this year's examination will use a test format, which is broader and cannot be temporarily prepared. Those who have consistently good academic performance and are not rote learners do not need to prepare temporarily. There will be no examination for screening for students in their second year of university or above. A different screening method will be determined separately.</p>

<h3>Special Consumption Taxes from Various Regions Remitted to the Central Reserve Bank</h3>
<p>The special consumption tax during wartime, organized by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, for both retail of goods and consumption taxes on banquets and hotels, was first levied in the fifteen major cities in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special cities of Beijing and Shanghai, starting from January 16th of this year. Then, on May 16th, it was further extended to all districts, counties, towns, and villages in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. The competent authorities for tax collection are the tax authorities in the jurisdictional areas of the various tax branches of the Taxation Department. Areas without tax authorities are collected by local government agencies on behalf of the tax authorities. Because local financial authorities in various provinces insisted on objections, they had been actively promoting tax administration, so the Taxation Department has been ordered to collect the consumer tax seriously. All the consumer taxes collected by the local tax authorities are transferred to the national treasury through the branch offices.</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Central Reserve Bank Remittance Business</p>
<p>In order to regulate funds and facilitate the operation and prosperity of commerce and industry by merchants and people, the Central Reserve Bank is doing its best to handle inland remittance business. Branches in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Huaihai, Guangdong, and Hubei have been linked for remittance, and the remittance fees charged are extremely low. Recently, in order to prevent the use of remittance funds for speculative business, the amount of remittance has been subject to considerable restrictions. It is now known that the remittances from Shanghai to the mainland have increased in recent months, and the remittances into Shanghai have also increased significantly. In May of this year, remittances from the mainland to Shanghai amounted to more than 900 million yuan, and remittances from Shanghai totaled more than 342 million yuan, of which the most went to Guangzhou, Hankou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Wuxi, Bengbu, Suzhou, and Anqing.</p>

The total income is more than 13,590,000 yuan. After listing the necessary expenses in detail, it is heard that all designated funds are centrally deposited in the Central Reserve Bank, totaling more than 9,870,000 yuan. In addition, donations for aircraft purchases and donations for cloth offerings are still deposited in the Shanghai Fuxing Bank.

<h3>Minister Matsushima Discusses the Pacific War Situation: American Fleet Suffers Alarming Losses</h3>
<p>Colonel Matsushima, Minister of Reporting for the Allied Japanese Fleet, gave a speech yesterday (the 7th) at the Joint Army-Navy Press Conference regarding the general situation in the recent Pacific War.</p>
<p>Fleeing in Embarrassment</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima said that the enemy's mobile forces attacked the Ogasawara Islands and Iwo Jima, but the Japanese army and air force defending the locations fought together. The enemy has been forced to flee in embarrassment, and the enemy mobile force is no longer present on the sea surface from that area to Ban Island. However, the enemy is still overestimating itself and continues to recklessly attempt to launch a last-ditch attack with some of its ships in conjunction with ground combat forces. From June 11 to the end of June, the enemy spared no effort to transfer the majority of its Pacific fleet to attack Japan's inner line islands. In the fierce battles over these twenty days, the enemy's American ships suffered heavy damage, with more than forty-eight ships sunk or damaged by the Japanese military and 665 aircraft lost. At the same time, they suffered significant losses on land. On the 5th of this month, American Secretary of the Navy Forrestal admitted that the damage suffered in the battle of Ban Island was unexpected. Therefore, the Japanese navy's skillful operations have resulted in alarming losses for the American fleet under the induced strategy.</p>
<p>Boasting Shamelessly</p>
<p>Currently, most of the enemy's Pacific fleet has been sunk or damaged, and the remaining ships are still attempting to repair and replenish supplies in Hawaii or the Marshall Islands. Although the heroic Japanese navy has achieved this great victory, it is still conserving its strength and waiting for the remaining enemies to complete their replenishment before launching a renewed attack on them. What you should particularly understand is that the American navy has suffered extremely heavy damage. Furthermore, the replenishment of damaged ships at sea is very different from the replenishment of ground troops, and it is difficult to achieve the same speed as the surface assembly. Therefore, the enemy naval authorities are very anxious, so it is no wonder that Forrestal admitted in his statement on the 5th that the future of the naval battle is too distant. At the same time, the erroneous information published by Forrestal, claiming that 664 Japanese naval vessels were sunk or damaged near Ban Island, is truly shameless. Regardless of the nature of the American people, it is astonishing that the responsible naval commander would make such wild statements.</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Light Leakage</p>
<p>Then, he provided a detailed explanation of the Shanghai air defense problem, saying that after the Japanese army achieved great success in the Central China region, the American air force in Chongqing was deeply anxious. Recently, in order to implement "containment" tactics, they have been actively engaging in activities in the peaceful zone. Therefore, we should pay special attention to their attempts to use the bright moonlight period to engage in deceitful actions. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will pay further attention and strictly control lights. At the same time, the army and navy authorities have issued a special notice that no light leakage is allowed during future light controls. Those who dare to deliberately violate the rule will not only have their electricity supply cut off, but will also be severely punished according to military law. It is deeply hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will take on the responsibility of defending the city of Shanghai, and do their best to control themselves. This is what I deeply hope that the citizens of Shanghai will do.</p>

<h3>My Opinion on Adjusting the Shanghai People's Food Method</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>According to various statistics, the amount of rice produced in the Shanghai urban area is slightly over 192,000 shi in 1935, and at most 233,000 shi in 1941. The average annual output is only 200,000 shi. The total number of Chinese people in the urban area is about 3.2 million. Assuming that children account for one-quarter of the total number, and that adults consume six he of rice per day and children consume three he of rice per day, the annual consumption should be between 6.29 million shi and 6 million shi. Supply and demand offset each other, and the annual shortage is often around 5.5 million shi to 6 million shi, which must rely on imports from other places to make up for the shortage.</p>
<p>Since the Executive Yuan promulgated the Temporary Measures for the Food Rice of the People of Beijing and Shanghai on May 24th of this year (1944), and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government and the Rice and Grain Control Committee announced the Provisional Measures for the Management of Food Rice for the People of Shanghai on June 1st, the Rice Control Committee no longer seems to be responsible for the rice for Shanghai citizens' households. It is necessary to wait for the rice from farmers or purchasing merchants to arrive in Shanghai before it can be unified. Although the allocation price is said to be calculated by appropriately reducing the price of the tribute, it will inevitably be much higher than the previous allocation price. After these two measures were promulgated, the public was confused and restless all day long. Coupled with the manipulation of speculators and the purchase of large households, the price of rice rose sharply and was unattainable. On May 25th and 26th, the black market price of rice in Shanghai was still below 6,000 yuan per shi, but between June 2nd and 3rd, it soared to 13,000 yuan per shi, a surge unprecedented in its intensity. Most of the people in Shanghai are salary earners, and how many people have a monthly income of 10,000 yuan? Even if they have an income of 10,000 yuan, it is only enough to buy rice, and all other expenses can be said to have reached the point of being overwhelmed. Because of the unlimited quantity of transported people and the exemption from military rice purchase, the price of rice began to fall. However, since the Rice Control Committee implemented the purchase method on July 1, it has rebounded sharply. It is definitely not something that ordinary citizens can afford. If no proper and good strategy is planned, not only will the people be unable to bear it, but the entire society will be in danger of collapse. At that time, there were many comments on the previous two food rice management methods, but no specific measures had been pointed out. In addition to ordering the registered rice merchants to form a purchasing group, the authorities do not seem to have determined specific methods on how to promote it as efficiently as possible. Therefore, I dare to present my humble opinions:</p>
<h3>Dredging Rice and Grain Sources</h3>
<p>Procurement merchants purchasing from rice-producing counties: To make this method truly effective, there are still many difficulties to overcome. Although Shanghai residents are extremely anxious about food, the rice production in each county is also limited. Even if the procurement merchants have official passports, it is doubtful whether each county will be willing to cooperate. Therefore, the following four points should be noted in the procedures:</p>
<p>A. The government should issue an order to the three special municipalities and two cities, instructing their subordinates that rice merchants from Beijing and Shanghai with official passports to purchase rice should be allowed to do so. As for the quantity to be purchased, it should be based on statistics to comprehensively assess the availability, so that while meeting the needs of Shanghai residents, the needs of the local area can also be taken into account.</p>
<p>B. Rice and grain procurement must be expedited. In addition to those who voluntarily use their own (or company) funds for procurement, the funds of procurement merchants should be transferred by the municipal government and the Grain Control Committee to negotiate loans from banks to facilitate the process, so that the procured rice can be stored in designated public warehouses.</p>
<p>C. During this period of war, military transportation is extremely urgent, and rice and grain transportation inevitably faces difficulties. The government should strictly order its subordinates that, regardless of land or water transportation, rice and grain should be given priority over military transportation. If the shipping business can be encouraged and unnecessary passenger ships reduced, so as to increase transportation capacity and maintain the people's food supply, it is especially important.</p>
<p>D. In principle, the activities of independent rice merchants should be prohibited, but in reality, the power of independent rice merchants is essential to maintaining the food supply for Shanghai residents. Because independent rice merchants are driven by profit, the transportation is limited and the cost is increased due to the intermediary role of the independent rice merchants. Therefore, in principle, they should be prohibited. However, before the government has a definitive solution and rice and grain cannot be transported to Shanghai in large quantities, independent rice merchants are still great contributors to supplying food to Shanghai residents.</p>
<p>Adjusting the Food Grains Held by Shanghai Residents: Although there are no accurate statistics on the amount of grain stored by Shanghai residents, it is common for many wealthy residents to store grain for times of famine. Moreover, due to hoarding and manipulation by large households and unscrupulous merchants, the amount of grain stored is definitely not small. For emergency relief, it may be possible to first transfer and use it to meet the needs of providing rice to registered households. The methods are as follows:</p>
<p>A. Purchasing Stored Grain According to Grain Control Committee Notice No. 12: "The amount of rice stored by residents should be limited to three months, and any amount exceeding that will be considered hoarding." Therefore, all civilian stored grain exceeding three months can be purchased immediately to meet civilian needs. In the meantime, there are still matters that need to be explained, that is, the quantity of rice per person per month is not specified, which causes the difficulty of not knowing what to do. During wartime, it may be advisable to set a limit of 1.5 dou per person per month, averaging the large and small, which should be sufficient to meet the needs.</p>
<p>B. Purchase Price: The purchase price of civilian stored grain should be calculated based on the cost plus a 20% profit margin. Everything may be lenient so that people are happy to sell, but it should be much cheaper than the market price. In addition, the purchase price must be paid promptly, and do not delay, so as not to lose credibility.</p>
<p>C. The local community leaders should conduct investigations and report on the grain stored by various parties. It is not easy to know everything. At this time when there is a shortage of old and new grain and rice prices are rising daily, how easy is it to ask people to sell enthusiastically? The only way is to order the local community leaders to conduct thorough investigations and report truthfully, and economic police should be responsible for reviewing. If there are any violations, they will be punished accordingly. If the grain purchased from the people can also be used for the people, it will naturally win the support of the majority of the people.</p>
<h3>Procurement of Grain Institutions</h3>
<p>Unification of Rice Procurement Organizations: From now on, there should be a responsible organization for rice procurement in Shanghai. If the Grain Administration Bureau is responsible, the Rice Control Committee may be abolished. If the Rice Control Committee is responsible, the Grain Bureau should also be merged. Not only are the functions of affiliated organizations such as the Procurement Team and the Preparatory Committee of the Rice and Grain Trade Association mixed and difficult to clarify, but the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Committee and the Central China Rice Allocation Association should also be merged to unify authority and fix responsibility.</p>
<p>Personnel Issues: Grain administration is related to the people's food supply, and personnel should be strictly screened. How the grain administration organization should be adjusted in the future is the sole responsibility of the standing bureau, and outsiders should not interfere. However, personnel issues must be carefully considered and must not repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Supervision Issues: Since the implementation of the controlled economy, the power of the person in charge is very large, they can make decisions on everything, and there are more opportunities for abuse. Without a strict supervision mechanism, it is not easy to achieve the effect of prevention. Furthermore, in times of chaos, severe punishment should be applied, and there should be no tolerance, lest it invites trouble. The Shanghai Municipal Advisory Committee's proposal to establish a supervisory committee is an urgent matter.</p>
<h3>Other Issues</h3>
<p>Find a way to maintain the household rice during this transitional period: The distribution of household rice must be maintained, so that there is hope for lower rice prices.</p>
<p>Abolish excessive taxes: There are many reasons why rice and grain in Shanghai are much more expensive than in the inland areas, and extortion by the military police and harassment by excessive taxes are also important reasons, which must be stopped as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Food conservation: At this critical time of crisis, people should be advised to conserve food or use miscellaneous grains as substitutes to help them through the difficulties.</p>

<p>Sakura and Anchor (4)</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, another year has passed, and 1941 has arrived. It doesn't feel like a universal New Year, because on top of the 2600th year of the era, we need to add a one, so the entire nation feels that something new is about to begin. The Japanese Imperial Army is not only flexing its military power on the Chinese mainland, spreading the nation's virtues, but also has troops stationed in French Indochina. In Europe, Germany has already gained absolute military dominance. Moreover, the abolition of the Japan-US Treaty of Commerce and Navigation has not only taken effect, but Roosevelt also declared in his New Year's address that he would fully aid democratic countries. Even Muta-guchi Takao, who lives in a small apartment, wants to flip through photos of warships and face the main battleships of Britain and America.</p>
<p>Majoto often writes letters, saying that the situation in the Pacific is becoming increasingly urgent, but he never says anything specific. Beyond that, his letters are full of a soldier's determination and hope, and words of encouragement for Takao.</p>
<p>One day, Majoto wrote in a letter: "The warship I'm serving on has been changed again. Because it's a warship that moves suddenly and frequently, please send letters directly to the dormitory from now on." Takao felt very sad, because he couldn't see the majesty of the warship that Majoto was serving on in the photo album.</p>
<p>Soon after, Tokyo was entering early summer. It was the first day of Navy Memorial Day. Takao received a very solemn letter. The sender was a certain organization of the Navy and the Marine Art Association, jointly named.</p>
<p>The Marine Art Association has been holding a marine painting exhibition every spring for the past two or three years, so Takao has gone to see it, but he was disappointed because all the paintings were marine landscapes such as fishing villages and lighthouses. This year he was planning to go, but he hadn't left yet.</p>
<p>Takao thought that he had received an invitation, so he hurriedly opened the letter. But inside, it wasn't a printed item, but a long letter written with a brush:</p>
<p>"This time, your work "Warship" has been reviewed and it has been decided to request an award from the Minister of the Navy..."</p>
<p>Takao was so surprised that he almost jumped up. He had not submitted anything, but it had been reviewed and would be requested an award from the Minister of the Navy. Of course, he was surprised.</p>
<p>(What's going on?)</p>
<p>He was stunned for a long time, even forgetting to breathe.</p>
<p>That painting was stored in Ichirai San's houseboat. On the day he submitted it for competition, he was harshly criticized by Tsuruhara, and Ichirai's ambiguous attitude made Takao fly into a rage. Later, he even went to Ichirai's residence to get his father's funds, but he only stood at the door and received the money from his wife, and he didn't go to the houseboat. At the same time, he never mentioned that painting again after that. (113)</p>

<h3>Problem of Household Deregistration After Distribution Certificate is Used</h3>
<p>My friend, Mr. Zhou, who has been unemployed for a year, recently found a job in Beijing and was about to set off, but unexpectedly, because the distribution certificate has been used, a problem arose in deregistering his household. The cloth purchase certificate he received had already been used to buy cotton cloth, and it had been made into new clothes so that he could bring them with him when he left. Even the invoices had been discarded. Now the issuing office must ask him to submit the cloth purchase certificate before he can deregister his household. However, this kind of cloth purchase certificate has already been used, so where can he get it again? My friend's family depends on him for a living, so he has to go to work, and of course he has to deregister his household, so a serious difficulty has arisen. I checked and "household deregistration is not allowed within six months after the distribution certificate is used" Citizens have not seen this notice beforehand. Now that a problem has arisen, I don't know if there is any remedy. I hope the authorities will give some guidance.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>National doctor Zhao Langxuan, in view of the fact that the hot season has arrived and diseases are rampant, in order to be considerate of the difficult times and benefit the poor and sick, has decided to provide free diagnosis and medicine from 9:00 to 10:00 every morning. Anyone who cannot afford to see a doctor and take medicine may go for diagnosis and treatment. Address: No. 32 Yuancheng Lane, Da Yu Road (old Rue Chapsal). Consultation phone number 83001.</p>
<p>Tao Geng Early Clinic Hours: National medical expert in internal medicine and gynecology Tao Geng's clinic is located on Rue Chapsal (now Ji'an Road). He uses his own ingenuity to uniquely treat typhoid fever, damp-heat, dysentery, and gynecological problems such as pregnancy, uterine bleeding, and stomach problems. Recently, due to the hot weather, he has moved up his clinic hours. Those in need can try it out, and the fees are not calculated for those with difficult illnesses.</p>
