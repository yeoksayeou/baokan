<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c1">不要做新猶太人 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>有人說，一部份上海人是新猶太人。這一句話，對於上海人是一個極大的恥辱。要洗雪這個恥辱，就得要事實表現，證明上海人沒有猶太心理，上海人根本不是新猶太人。</p>
<p>猶太人的第一個特點就是唯利是圖。因爲唯利是圖，所以不顧一切和不擇手段地侔命要錢。為了錢，他可以不顧顏面，他可以做一切平常人所想不到的欺騙，下流，卑鄙的勾當，他顧意　牲他的人格，他不顧一切道德的制裁。這樣的人，對大家對社會都沒有好處，自然被社會所輕視，自然要被社會所遺棄。上海人要是不顧做猶太人，那末，心理上先要去除「唯利」兩字，我們要「唯義」是圖一。義者，宜也。凡是應當做的，不論有利無利，我們就應當做去。凡是不應當做的，無論有任何天大的利益，我們決不可做。孔子說，「君子喻於義，小人喻於利」，又說，「不義而富且貴，於我如浮望」·第一句話，說明君子小人義利之別，第二句話，說明不義的富貴，正如浮雲一般，頃刻就可消減。這兩句話，在目前非常環境裹面，更容易顯出他的確定性，值得大家猛省。</p>
<p>猶太人的第二個特點就是唯已主義，猶太人可以說真是「拔一毛而利天下，不為也」的標準。為了他本身，他可以不顧一切情誼，不認他的親戚朋友，他可以做出一切寡廉鮮恥的行動，他甚至可以陷害他的朋友，社會和他的國家。這樣的人，誰要他做朋友；這樣的人，那個國家要他做國民？猶太人所以只能做孤苦零丁，東奔西逃的流浪者，其根木原因，就在於此。上海人要是不願意做猶太人，那末，心理上就要去除「唯己」兩字，我門要「捨己利人」。我們雖然不能够做到「　頂放踵，利天下而為之」，可是這種偉大的利人精神，我們應常刻放在心上，我們應當刻刻把他做行事的標準。</p>
<p>猶太人的唯利，猶太人的唯己，使猶太人喪失了祖國。猶太人乃是世界上永久不能翻身的亡國奴，他做定了真實道地的亡國奴。上海人想想，我們有沒有唯利唯己的心理，我們有沒有唯利唯己的舉動，假如有的，那末我們是在步猶太人的後塵，追隨着做亡國奴，我們就得要趕快改正，努力革新，重新做個中華民國的國民。</p>
<p>本報二十日社評，我們為警察消費合作社事，提起一般富有者，對於社會福利，漠不關心，而對於自身李用，窮奢極慾。這些都是猶太人心理，猶太人行動，上海人應當痛心疾首的加以革除。我們所以要口誅筆伐的原因，就在道些行為的發展，足以毀滅上海，毀滅上海人民。警察消費合作社一件事，可以試騐上海有多少「拾己利羣」的人，况且，墊款並非捐助，根本不用「捨己」。，維持市民秩序，「利羣」即是「利己」。我們顧意拭目以覜上海的一部分新猶太人的消減。</p>

<h3 id="c4">蘇門答腦西海面敵機十架被擊落　印度洋方面日軍嚴陣以待 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營二十一日下午四時發表：四月十九日上午，敵機動部隊出現於錄門答臘西方海岸，並曾空襲薩班島，該方面日軍當即迎擊之，計擊落敵機十架，日方損害輕微。　　東京二十一中央社電　東南亞細亞反軸心軍司令官蒙特巴頓為掩飾印緬國境之敗戰，將由印度洋方面展開某種程度之海上作戰，此早為日電所預料，故駐屯該方面之日陸軍各部隊，無時不嚴陣以待。敵軍果於四月十九日晨於英印度洋艦隊司令長官索馬維爾指揮下之機動部隊，進　蘇門答腦島西方海面，並於艦上飛機約九十架來犯北接蘇門答腦之薩班日軍根據地。緣此次來犯之敵機動部隊，係以航空母艦一艘至二艘局主幹，敵艦上轟炸機羣并配有戰鬥機羣護衛，此次敵機來襲之消息傳來時，駐屯當地之日軍部隊即加以邀擊，旋即展開激烈空戰，如日大本營所發表者，計擊落敵機十架，是役日方損害極輕微。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　印緬國境方面，日軍發動進攻印度作戰以後，伊姆法爾之陷落已迫眉睫，今反軸心軍陳營亦因迭次戰敗，與各方之積極非難，致深感狼狽。同時，蒙特巴頓於狼狽之餘，乃將司令部遷至錫蘭島，并為掩飾在伊姆法爾之敗戰，最近似欲在印度洋方面伺機發動某種攻勢，眾認此次敵機動部隊之進擾蘇門答臘西方海面，即為其發動攻勢之表現。蓋敵機之來襲蘇門答臘海面，自去年年底即極形頻繁，但自本年以來始稍為斂跡。本年三月以來，安達受方面僅有敵蚊式飛機三架來襲，蘇門答臘島西南端之斯美烏爾方面，三月二十六日僅有敵大型機一架來襲，波特布拉阿方面，僅有敵機十二架來襲，處此情形之下，當時印度洋方面戰事無若何變化，但臼軍為同印緬國境與英軍交戰，勢將使印度洋戰局呈現某種之動向，此為吾人所早已料及者。茲日方為慶付印度洋之戰局，今已整備禺全之邀擊態勢，以待敵之來襲矣。</p>

<p>敵東南亞洲反軸心靈司令官蒙特巴頓自於去年八月二十五日就任以來，即高呼東南亞洲反攻口號，然實際上並無顯着成績可觀，反被日駐緬精銳之　軍部隊突破印細國境，致該方面大動脈之孟加拉，阿　密鐵道頓受重大威骨，因之引起美國及渝方之絕對不滿。敵為敷衍塞靑起見，遂有此次出擊蘇門答臘之舉，藍此次敵所攻擊目標之蘇班島，為位於日方支配　最西端之　爾小島，在戰略上，並非如何重要，敵方宣傳已獲實大戰果，其實在此項戰略上並非重耍之地點，實無敢獲大戰果之可能。又敵方此次所出擊之兵力，據稱為由戰船，航空母體，巡洋艦，　逐艦，潛水艦等所編成之大艦隊，然實際上該方面之敵方艦除僅為由在西太平洋或歐洲方面遭日·　海軍學潰之殘敗艦艇集合而成，係屬島合之眾，　無實力可言。敵方之此項　動，對於日印同盟軍之印度解放作戰，絕無絲亳影響，若其目的在牽制在印度之日印同盟軍，則　特巴頓雖愚，當不至出擊，至反對方面徒勞精力，且敵東南亞洲軍司令部已移至錫蘭，曼耶所部之敵航空部隊，傳亦已由新德里移至加爾各答，則該方面之擊局似有逐漸由陸地移至海上之傾向。目下日方海軍已考慮一切條件，靜待機會，敵方如敢大舉出擊，決予以滇底擊滅。</p>

<p>中央社訊　最近渝方漸貝「民主主義」，而趨獨裁體制，因此曾引起美　輿論之議論。美輿論界此舉，係美知識層間一時「自由中國」至幻滅，抑係反應美當局之意向，至今尚未明瞭。但美國此種輿論，似層予重慶當局以相當之衝動。關於此事，逾宜傳部長梁寒操，最近接見外國記者時會謂：逾方有如一間廢屋，今始踏上</p>
<p>民主國家</p>
<p>之建設途上故一切未上軌道之事，均請諸君寬怒之云。由此而親，亦足證明渝方衝動之　結矣。即在重慶政權內部，對重慶之非民主主義方式，亦曾加以種種非難，實堪汪目。同時，渝立法院長孫科，最近亦曾在演說中申述意見謂：國民黨於過去二十年間，并未一能實現民主主義，并謂國民黨今日已失去其本然之一特質，墜入支配陛級之態度及習慣中云，力促常局改革此種不良現象。蓋蔣介石為加强其獨裁權，過去曾與少數之政敵鬥爭，今彼在內政上之</p>
<p>根本難題</p>
<p>厥為處理中央問題。中共刻正故意要求重慶政權，澈底實行民主政治，此點由蔣介石方面而觀，認中共急於纂奪重慶政權，實嚴當然。同時重慶之苦惱，更在於經濟上之困難。外國記者最近曾指出通貨膨脹下重歷經　之混亂謂：重慶一般人民因經濟之混亂，生活極其不安，今渝方能施行民主主義，把握統制力量，以蘇民困，誠堪注視。另一方面蔣介石恐有傷美國之感情，因此重慶乃不能不假裝實行民主主義。由一上種種現實，而視世界四大民主主義之一之渝方，進日實已遭逢深刻之難關矣。</p>

<p>現在國際情勢最顯著的特色，長英美蘇三國的不協調，及英國處境的困苦。最露骨地表示英美蘇三國不協謂的是蘇聯正式承誦巴政權。英美的反對蘇聯，芷中了蘇聯的國套。</p>
<p>英美起初以為蘇聯實是最反對巴陀里奧的。邱吉爾的聲明說：「英國政府在進入羅馬之前，支持巴政權。」還是表示將來不承為巴陀里奧。據曼徹斯德導報所認示，蘇聯利用這　明指令義大利的共產黨員煸動反英空氣，於是竟不諮詢英政府，地中海委昌會，及歐洲委員會，而突然承認巴政權。這據傳是北非蘇聯的代表維辛斯基的獻策，而為蘇聯之現實主義外交的表現。當羅斯福聲明將義艦隊分讓於蘇聯時，英國頗感慌張，而藉口義艦隊在引渡前恐將自沈，而反對此舉。蘇聯乃承訊巴政權，表示親善的恣態，使英國無所藉口。</p>
<p>三國會談的假面具</p>
<p>英許論家伐農，巴特萊德在倫敦的新聞紀事報上說；「因英美欲使義大利從戰本中脫離，與蘇聯商談，締結休戰條約，蘇聯乃正式承認巴政權，此與休戰條約不能兩立。</p>
<p>泰晤士報及其他各報亦均發表同樣論調，說英美的利益與面子完全推翻了。不儘如此，在莫斯科會談，德黑蘭會談中宣傳的三國協調，其假面具亦真相畢露。美國各報亦一致非難攻繫蘇聯的態度。</p>
<p>然不僅英美蘇三國之間不協調，即英美之閒意見亦不一致。美國對阿根廷，西班牙，愛爾蘭等國的恐嚇外交，靈德英國迷惑。如其成功固佳，如其失敗，則不能不與美國一同實施經濟制裁。然而這樣一來，被封鎖的反是英國。英國如其沒有阿根廷來的肉，西班牙來的鎮礦石及其他，就不能忍受下去。然而英美的恐嚇外交，一反他們的預期，並未成功。這長因為英美的信用掃地，戰局的進展，破壞了他們的宣傳。</p>
<p>過分的美國外交</p>
<p>至於英國對土耳其的失敗，曼徹斯德　報稱：「地中海戰綫的失敗，妨害英土交涉的成立。」阿根廷不接受美國對軸心意戰的要求，卒在美國的壓迫之下，大總統賴米雷斯正式　表辭戰，再加上承認福萊爾新政權的智力。玻　維亞，巴拉圭，想造成對抗美國制　南美的甫美集團。對西班牙所要求者，完全撤退在東錢的義勇軍，移交義船，開放丹吉爾國際地帶，停止供給重要物資於德國，美國更用物的壓力，預料即可就範，但始終沒有實現的形勢。上述的巴特萊非難美國說：</p>
<p>或許會使阿根廷的肉，西班牙的戮礦石中止輸入的行動，應在英美務三國之間慎重討論之後，付之實施。</p>
<p>非難屈服於美國</p>
<p>對愛爾蘭，英國的與論，一般對追隨美國之後實行經濟制裁，大表反對。芬蘭的對蘇和平問題，英美也失敗了。券蘭和平前年美國已經策動，而告失敗，後來英國亦曾繼續努力。英美希望芬蘭經由英美而與蘇聯交涉。但蘇聯反對主張直接交涉，蘇聯與芬蘭均不顧英國　足其間。</p>
<p>羅邱新會談</p>
<p>對以上諸情勢，英美不能不請求新的對策。據路透社的紐約電，羅邱預備新會談，其討論題目，據傳為占領羅馬後的承總巴政權問題，發表戰後方　之新聲明，統一南國各黨派，處理退出軸心的國家等許多政治問題。（觀譯自三月廿五臼西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>首由主席聞　亭氏致詞略謂；今天是上海工商聯誼會，市民福利協會，　民外交促進會，新聞聯合會四團體，歡迎宇佐美公使來滬履任。公使是日本外交界優秀人才，服務三十餘年，久着名譽，二十年前担任國際聯盟帝國事務局長，已經聞名國際。民國二十三年來華，任福州總領事。前年，日本大東亞省成立，出任中國事務局長，對於中日合作極具熱情。此次出使上海，可謂得人得所。我們於敬表歡迎之餘，盼望公使推誠相與，促成中日合作未完工作。現在請陳彬穌先生代表致詞。</p>
<p>本報陳社長詞</p>
<p>國民政府還都以後，中日參戰以後，日本實踐對華新政策以後，中日簽訂同盟條約以後，大東亞會議發表宣言以後，對於中日合作，同甘共苦，同生共存，一切的中日親善名詞，早已確定其意義與精神，不必再加說明，不成為問題了。也可以說，東亞存榮的整個命運，中日合作的命運，巳經註定，更不必加以解釋了。而問題只在於怎樣實現「參戰」。「新政策」，「同盟條約」。「大東亞宣言」，「中日合作」。「同甘共苦」等等名詞使之具體化，使之完成共同目的。如果只有了好的名詞，而不能實現。就成為背後無事實的空名詞，積漸時日，使一般人民逐漸發生懷疑。由懷疑而失却價仰，最為危險。所以，我們必須亡獻於中日雙方當局，特別重視「實現」問題。</p>
<p>怎樣「實現」呢？當然包括許多問題。我們　為技術問題，却佔有非常重要的地位。木月十七日申報社評，歡迎小倉最高經濟顯問，會說：「經濟病熊的主因，在於政治不良，而應丞謀革新，但　濟措施的幼術方面，也很重要。尤其是經濟措施的原則與制度，雖經確定，而實踐時必須顧到適應國情民情的環境，在不達背戰時經濟原則之下，措施之間，並非一成不變，瞽如統制經濟之制度及原則，固然是戰時國家所必須採取者，但在中國實施以米，就但見其　－未見其利，中國實施統制，不但未能刺激生產，甚至妨礙生產。其原因但知囫圇吞　引用原則，不知在實施技術上適應特有環境。」這裹，值得重複的提出。我們認為不僅戰時經濟統制問題如此，一切與中日合作有關問題，如果實施以後，有弊無利，或弊多利少，即應研究其原因所在？為什麼行不通，也應澈底研求，設法即予補救。所以，按術問題，如不研究補　，因而未能實現中日合作，則政策的好意，更將無形消失。</p>
<p>上海的地位重要，我們已經言之，而上海地方的病象，最生要者還是經濟問題，危機嚴重的如物價高漲，生　萎縮。宇佐美公使是常駐上海服務的，劃於上海地位的重要，諒早已熱知，而物價高漲與生產萎縮的兩個經濟危機，諒世為公使所洞鑒，那末，我們就希望公使在技術方面特別帮助，得到解決辦法。使上海造成國經濟的中心，某中和發揮經濟力量，貫獻於大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>最後，我們知道宇佐公使是盟邦外交界　出人才，在上海的重要地位之中，複雜環境之中，嚴車危機之中，必能就本身職糧，運用學識經騐，克盡促進中日合作的使命。</p>
<p>宇佐美公使詞</p>
<p>今天承上海四個團證諸位先生，在百忙中抽暇齊集一堂，為本人開此盛大歡迎會，本人護先表示衷心感謝。上海為中國經濟文化最重要的地方，且為一與日本關係更密切之所。前任田尻公使，因榮調他職，本人才疏學淺，繼其後任，一面感到無限光榮，一面感覺責任重大。本人於未赴任前，任大東亞省中國事務局長之職，於東京一直擔任處理中國關係的事務，故對增進中日親善提携與中國之復興，深切關心。冀望中日兩團國民，能彼此真切了解，開誠相與，緊密協力，俾達到向建設新當亞邁進之美滿理想。本人於此亦進備以所具棉力，克盡一切努力，以達到此理恕。關於目前緊急之各種問　，亦準備體察中央方針，按諸實悄而定緩急，彼此在互相理解信任下，以期逐步予以解決，與諸位共回打開此難關。希望諸位賜與全力之協力與援助。日本政府為改善中日關係，曾於去年首先交還租界，撤產治外法權，實行政治上，經濟上之各　果斷政策，赤誠與中國協力。總之，又締結中日同盟條約，日本此種一貫政策，其根本精神，在　中日間關係恢復本然之姿態，使中國恢復自主的發展國力，而由東亞中樞之中日兩國，共同協力，摒除鴉片戰爭以來，百年中英美侵略東亞政策，樹立東亞各民族互相信任親　關係，携手前進，以期確立大束亞各民族永久共存共榮基礎。其結神正與去年東亞各國共同發表之大東亞共同宜言理想完全相同。日本方面已將建設新秩序之障得的英美勢力，完全逐出東亞，並全面協力中國，消除過去所有之國際上經濟上之拘東，使中團能自土發展，以增進中日間提攜。日本此種方針，此後仍不變更，繼續依照所定万針，克盡一切協力與努力。不過，同時不可忘者，即為實出此東亞各國共存共榮理想，各國各民族，必須各各分担其責任，各自充分努力。諸位均知，所謂共存共榮，所謂提携協力，皆以各國本身復興進步為基石。所謂各國復興進步，又必須先賴各國國民本身之努力，此乃常然之理，且就中國血言，本人亦深倌至現在為止，日本方面之各項新指置，若不得中國官民之積極努力，決難獲得所期之成果、例如交還租界，移交軍管理工塲等，中國方面如何予以活用，如何收六實質之効果，均有待於中國方面有力者之努力。換言之，此後最重要問題，即須視中國國內問題，能如何充分利用其新材料，而確立中國真正自立自存之基礎。國府己充分考慮此點，過去曾經勞力。最近更闡明以肅正思想，確保治安，增加生產，為當前重要政策。對復興農村，振興生產工業，澄淸吏治，安定物價，積極努力。本人仍感國府之施策，若不得國民的協力，仍難得效。故深望諾位能充分認識此點，協力政府，為達到所期目的而盡力。本人提出此點，似有多言之嫌。但本人因愛中國，希望中國復興，以中國友人之立場，乃敢作此期望，謹請各位對此原諒。且下吾人為建設大東亞而進行之共同戰爭，已入最熾烈之決戰階段，東亞各國興隆，咸繫於此。但太人確信大東亞正於必勝不敗之態勢下，逐漸完　最後勝利的目的，有此確信始可產生克服所有困難之力量。任何國家與戰爭進展中不免有種種精神得物質的困難，此乃當然的現象，不僅中國如此。本人深信克服最大困苦者，始能達到最大之偉業。我等對現實之困苦，不可拌折，不可悲觀消極，應積極堅持勇敢與希望，向完　此大業　進。反之，若吾人消失此希望與勇氣時，東亞將永久成為英美奴隸。當前各種問題，尤其關於經濟問題，為了戰時必然之坸束，余田當有不少難以解決問還。但此種問題，祇須亙相有充分之創意與思考，以誠意積極之努力，余以為定有解決之這。尤以上海居中國政治經濟思想等中心之重要都市，更可明瞭當地社會領袖之勞力，對解決問題改善專熊，具有如何重大力量。同時今日常常呼　之中日經濟提携，相信等待各位盡力處頗多。關於中日關係，貴國國父曾云：「有日本，始有中國；無中國，亦無日本」。注主席亦曾言及乃同甘共苦，同生共死之關係。故吾人極盼中國國民能依此指示，互相提携協力，以打破難關，而達到光榮之彼岸。本人確信，紙有諸君與吾人之協力與努力，始能縮短現在之共苦時間，使不久將來臨之同甘。本人最後要求諸君於此信念下，多予協力及努力。以上所述，聊表本人感想，藉以感謝各位盛意。最後由國民外交促進會會員李芳致詞，至六時許始盡歡而散。</p>

<p>第三屆東亞聲學天會，定本月二十五日在京舉行揭寡，緬甸國特派代表二人，為該國及仰光教育公眾衛生省聲務局畏巴唐淸，公眾衛生局長伍孟幹，由仰光出發，於太月十九日抵滬，特於昨（二十一）日下午二時，假座匯中飯店六樓，接見本市中外記者，定於明（二十三）日晉京。據巴唐淸及伍孟幹談稱：此次大會討論主題有六，為肺病，　疾病，麻　病，黑死病，嚴重性傳染病等，該會對大東亞醫學前送之實戲必鉅。繼又稱緬甸國現有醫科學校二所，學生七百除人，為適應戰時需要，特將肄業年限縮短為五年一，以訓練多數醫學人才。自大東亞戰爭發生以來。緬甸人民除努力於建設外，並積極協助既邦以期完成大東亞戰爭。緬甸處於最前綫，全國各地隨時有被敵機空襲可能，然全國官民均以大無畏精神應付敵機不時之轟炸，政府當局對於建設有詳細計劃，惟因戰事影響，現正逐步求早日完成。至於滇緬公路之切斷，對於緬甸本國無重大影響。</p>

<p>日在滬艦隊報道部，昨（廿一日）循例招待中國記者團，發表談話，松島報道部長，　田大尉，新任上海在勤報道部員平田中尉，劉震南，王炳南等均出席，首由盟田大尉介紹平田中尉與記者等會見，松島部長遂即席發表談片。茲將所述各點，錄耍如左：</p>
<p>第二戰線將成具體</p>
<p>歐洲第二戰線，將由醞釀而成具體化，關於此事之準備工作，吾人以為四月十七日英政府通告限制中立國外交宜更活動一點，可資證明。最堪使吾人驚異者，即此項通告，對重慶政權在英外交人員之活動，亦受同等之限制待遇，可知英美除利用重慶作其犧牲工具外，並無其他優待事項，縱有之亦不過基於英美利益為出發點。</p>
<p>重慶新兵已受監禁</p>
<p>四月十九日美合眾社駐昆明特派員向紐約電吿，謂蔣介石近下令將征募之新兵與舊兵分別隔離，勿令與舊兵接近，似有防舊兵逃亡之意義存在。此電司證明合眾社特派員對重慶亦無好感，彼發此不利於重慶之消息，殊足表示彼對蔣政權之不滿。</p>
<p>渝軍代表被炸死傷</p>
<p>據四月十大日新德里特電稱：在孟買碼頭發生爆炸事件，重慶駐東南亞洲總司令部代表會萬里上將死亡，陳景嘉少將以及另一連絡官同受重傷。吾人對此傷心事件，對重慶極表同情，此慘案發生，緣於英方警戒疏忽，重慶對英美以全副精神供馳驅，而所得結果如此，吾人於同情之餘，尤覺可憫。</p>
<p>金錢奴役美空戰士</p>
<p>關於美軍在歐洲之作戰精砷，吾人可於下述事實中知之。據塲德里電：美空軍某戰士在瑪德里以降落傘降落，該人生於芝加哥。據其告人稱：彼每　機出動一次，可得獎賞金美金八百元。由此而觀，司知美軍作戰所本之精神，全在金錢，根本不知為國為民，殊為可嘆可憐。</p>
<p>燃料充足致勝之機</p>
<p>關於太平洋戰事，自前仍呈靜寂狀態，美團迭次宣傳，將以大規模艦隊向日軍進攻，美國所用之跳島職術，必將再遭失敗，因美海軍愈接近日本內防禦綫，其困難愈多。如　日本內防禦綫堅强，美之犧牲極大。　美因補給路遠，途中各鳥　大兵力防禦。　海上行動之燃料問題。不能順利解決。美海軍所具困難之條件，日方均無，尤其關於燃料問觀，日海軍準備極佳，極易解決，可謂亳不成問題。此點可於最近「日蘇北　太石油利權委讓約」中證明之。日海軍燃料　富足為致勝之途，美海軍如自不最力侵犯日內防　綫，必遭當年俄　隊再波羅的海所受之命運。若美軍以「一舉作戰」之戰術企圖侵犯日內防禦綫，現勢亦不可能，因彼無可供利用之基地，一艦受傷，即無法修理，只有靜待被擊沉沒。吾人常聽美方宣傳大規模進攻，可惜世界周圍太大，使其無法成功，反之日海軍航空部隊日益加强，將來　滅太平洋之敵，可拭目而待。</p>
<p>印度洋上戰幕難啟</p>
<p>日國軍在伊紐法爾之作戰成功，消使蒙特巴頓還司令部於錫蘭，美航空部隊移往加爾各答。據情報稱，一部份敵艦集中錫蘭島，有反攻緬甸企圖，此點吾人觀察敵艦旨在牽制日軍在緬作戰，若謂反攻，則實力有未逮，印度洋之西南季節風不久即至，以七月為甚，不適於海軍作戰，彰彰明甚，緬甸雨季亦屆，更不利於敵作戰。故吾人預計，敵在印度洋作戰宣傳，僅為紙上談兵聊以解嘲而已。英美近更宣傳謂：日軍因遭受損害，故而退守，此事真相至本年下半年便知分曉。總之，日本之戰術非敵所能窺知，猶之大山以小石砸之無傷，小山若以大石碰之則狂鳴矣。</p>

<p>須臾間，橋板搭到岸上，於是人海的浪潮，涌到　上來。</p>
<p>倏然間，說話的喧　，脚步的聲音，外國氣的香水味，充滿了甲板，眞人等目瞪口呆地混入人　中了。</p>
<p>「鹿兒島縣人的候補生有麽？　筧鳥縣人的……」有一個男人這樣到處大聲喊着，偵好像旅館店夥招攬生意一樣。這個男人身穿　）淡灰色的西裝，是一位相當漂亮的中年紳士，額角上掛着汗珠，而這樣走着喊叫。</p>
<p>眞人心中忐忑不安地，情不自禁地，突然發出聲音來：「我是鹿兒烏人。」</p>
<p>「您是　兒鳥人？」紳士這樣重問了一句，就立刻在偵人的肩上，掛上一個大而軟的五顏六色的花圈。是一個充滿香味的黃色花圈。這是祝福的象微，眞人披着這件東西，頗覺難以爲情。</p>
<p>「歡迎，歡迎！這是我的名字，我住在茈地業已有十五年之久了。」紳士拿出名片來，上面印　英文字，銜是醫生。</p>
<p>「另外還有鹿兒島縣人麽？」</p>
<p>「候補年，還有一位呌態澤的，他在八　號上。」</p>
<p>「請您和他一同，我一定領導觀光各處。每天我用汽車來接送。」</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>六天的　泊期間，眞人等除了參觀和受歡迎外，簡直毫無一點空閑。眞怪，當地的僑跑爲什麼這樣　烈地歡迎自已呢？實在是百思無解的事。鹿兒島縣人的醫生，天天照例駕駛着自己的汽車，引導到城市內外去參觀。</p>
<p>「日本人和日本店鋪　多，阿！」汽車在金格大馬路上奔馳的時候，眞人對熊澤這樣說。就是生要的大馬路，甚至偏僻的小胡同，以及通向維基海岸的所在，都無處不看到日本人的面龐，日本人經營的商店和飯館。在一家店舖裏，眞人替家鄉的姐姐，買了三個手皮包。</p>
<p>「但，全夏威夷有十五萬日本人呵！」駕駛着汽車的醫生這樣說。自從慶應年間，最初向該處移民以來，經過賺錢時代，成家時代，土着時代，而一直到了今天，這種詳細的個中情形，都由醫生講出來。</p>
<p>「元年人，就是明治元年來夏威夷的人，這樣尙在人間的老叟仍然還可以碰到。至於第二代第三代的人在政界活躍的人也有，這眞是一買悠久的歷史。」</p>
<p>好像是證實醫生的話一樣，汽車採過了純粹日本式的廟宇，寺院，飯店等門前。在日本瓦的房頂上，錯綜紛亂地開放着金雨樹（Gololenvshower）的花，或是點綴着椰子樹葉，眞有點奇異的感覺。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Do Not Be New Jews <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Some people say that a portion of Shanghai people are new Jews. This statement is a tremendous disgrace to the people of Shanghai. To wash away this shame, we must demonstrate through actions that Shanghai people do not possess a Jewish mentality, that Shanghai people are fundamentally not new Jews.</p>
<p>The first characteristic of Jews is that they are solely driven by profit. Because they are solely driven by profit, they disregard everything and stop at nothing to desperately seek money. For money, they can disregard their reputation; they can engage in all kinds of deceitful, vulgar, and despicable activities that ordinary people cannot imagine; they are willing to sacrifice their character and disregard all moral constraints. Such people are of no benefit to anyone or to society; naturally, they are despised by society and abandoned by it. If Shanghai people do not want to be Jews, then psychologically, they must first remove the two words "solely profit." We must be driven by "solely righteousness." Righteousness means appropriateness. Anything that should be done, whether it is profitable or not, we should do. Anything that should not be done, no matter how great the benefits, we must never do. Confucius said, "The gentleman understands righteousness, the petty man understands profit," and also said, "Wealth and rank obtained through unrighteousness are like floating clouds to me." The first statement illustrates the difference between righteousness and profit for gentlemen and petty men; the second statement illustrates that unrighteous wealth and rank are like floating clouds, which can dissipate in an instant. These two statements, in the current extraordinary environment, more easily reveal their certainty and are worthy of everyone's deep reflection.</p>
<p>The second characteristic of Jews is egoism. Jews can truly be said to be the standard of "not doing it even if it benefits the world by plucking out a single hair." For the sake of themselves, they can disregard all feelings, disown their relatives and friends, and engage in all kinds of shameless actions. They can even harm their friends, society, and their country. Who would want to be friends with such people? What country would want such people as citizens? The fundamental reason why Jews can only be solitary, wandering exiles is precisely this. If Shanghai people do not want to be Jews, then psychologically, they must remove the two words "egoism." We must "sacrifice ourselves to benefit others." Although we may not be able to "wear out our hair and wear down our heels to benefit the world," we should always engrave this great spirit of benefiting others in our hearts, and we should always make it the standard for our actions.</p>
<p>The Jews' sole pursuit of profit and their egoism have caused them to lose their homeland. The Jews are forever a stateless people in the world, and they have become true and thorough stateless slaves. People of Shanghai, think, do we have the mentality of being solely driven by profit and egoism? Do we have actions motivated by profit and egoism? If we do, then we are following in the footsteps of the Jews, pursuing the path of becoming stateless slaves. We must quickly correct ourselves, strive for reform, and become citizens of the Republic of China anew.</p>
<p>In this newspaper's editorial on the 20th, regarding the police consumer cooperative, we raised the issue of the general wealthy class being indifferent to social welfare and indulging in extravagance and excess for their own enjoyment. These are all Jewish mentalities and Jewish actions, and Shanghai people should painfully and resolutely eliminate them. The reason why we are verbally and in writing criticizing is that the development of these behaviors is enough to destroy Shanghai and its people. The police consumer cooperative is a test of how many people in Shanghai "sacrifice themselves to benefit the group." Moreover, the advance payment is not a donation, so there is fundamentally no need to "sacrifice oneself." Maintaining civic order, "benefiting the group" is "benefiting oneself." We are willing to wait and see the reduction of a portion of the new Jews in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Ten Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in the Sea West of Sumatra, Japanese Forces on High Alert in the Indian Ocean <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 21st: On the morning of April 19th, an enemy task force appeared off the west coast of Sumatra and attacked Sabang Island. Japanese forces immediately engaged, shooting down ten enemy aircraft. Japanese losses were light. Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – The commander of the anti-Axis forces in Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, in order to cover up the defeat on the Indo-Burmese border, will launch some kind of naval operation in the Indian Ocean. This has long been anticipated by the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese army stationed in the area is constantly on high alert. As expected, on the morning of April 19th, under the command of Admiral Somerville, commander of the British Indian Ocean Fleet, the enemy task force advanced into the waters west of Sumatra, with approximately 90 aircraft from the fleet attacking the Japanese base on Sabang, north of Sumatra. The attacking enemy task force was mainly composed of one or two aircraft carriers, with a bomber group escorted by fighter planes. When news of the enemy attack arrived, the Japanese forces stationed in the area immediately engaged, leading to a fierce aerial battle. As announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, ten enemy aircraft were shot down, and Japanese losses were extremely light.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – On the Indo-Burmese border, since the Japanese army launched the offensive into India, the fall of Imphal is imminent. The anti-Axis forces are deeply embarrassed by repeated defeats and active criticism from all sides. At the same time, in his embarrassment, Mountbatten has moved his headquarters to Ceylon. To cover up the defeat at Imphal, he recently attempted to launch some kind of offensive in the Indian Ocean. It is believed that this raid on the waters west of Sumatra by the enemy task force is a manifestation of his offensive. The enemy aircraft attacks on the waters of Sumatra have been very frequent since the end of last year, but have subsided somewhat since the beginning of this year. Since March, only three enemy Mosquito aircraft have attacked the Andalas area, one large enemy aircraft attacked the Simeulue area southwest of Sumatra on March 26th, and twelve enemy aircraft attacked Port Blair. Under these circumstances, there has been no significant change in the Indian Ocean theater. However, the Japanese army's engagement with the British army on the Indo-Burmese border will likely cause some kind of movement in the Indian Ocean war situation. This has long been anticipated. Now, the Japanese side is fully prepared to counterattack in the Indian Ocean, awaiting the enemy's arrival.</p>

<h3 id="e9">Imphal Area Has Entered Fortress Warfare, Enemy Forces in Eastern India Greatly Reduced <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – From a certain base on the Indian front: The enemy's Fourth Corps, which is stubbornly resisting the southward advance of the Japanese-Indian army units on the line of defense more than ten kilometers north of Imphal and is desperately trying to stop the advance of the elite Japanese-Indian troops south of Imphal, is putting up an unusually fierce resistance because the Imphal northern position and Palel are their lifeline. However, due to the continuous fierce attacks by the Japanese-Indian allied forces, the enemy army has suffered heavy losses, and the Japanese-Indian army's encirclement is gradually shrinking. The Fourth Corps' combat power has weakened significantly, and the enemy's losses are most severe in the 17th Division, reaching at least 30,000 or more. The British-Indian army's 36th Division and mechanized 44th Division, which were dispatched by the 33rd Corps, the Eastern India General Reserve, to the front of Kohima, have also suffered heavy losses due to the fierce attacks by the new Indian army. Therefore, the enemy army's troop movements in eastern India are in a state of distress.</p>
<p>Zurich, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to United Press International: The anti-Axis command in Ceylon announced: "The Japanese-Indian army in the Indo-Burmese border has launched a very intense attack on Imphal and Kohima in the past 24 hours." It is rumored that bloody battles are unfolding in the area. Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Assam front: The Imphal capture operation is gradually evolving into fortress warfare. Although the enemy army is in chaos under the fierce attacks of the Japanese-Indian army, they still hope for the arrival of the rainy season and are deploying their air and land forces to the area, attempting to launch a desperate counterattack. The battle situation in the area is extremely fierce. The Japanese army's fierce attacks have indeed been effective, and the area is now being gradually encircled.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Enemy Attack on Sabang Island Strategically Unimportant <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Shanghai – The sudden dispatch of a task force by the enemy Southeast Asia anti-Axis Command to attack Sabang Island at the western tip of Sumatra is a perfunctory tactic adopted by enemy commander Mountbatten after continuous defeats due to extreme boredom. The following is a summary of the opinions of local military experts regarding the enemy's action:</p>
<p>Since taking office on August 25th of last year, the enemy Southeast Asia anti-Axis commander Mountbatten has been loudly proclaiming the slogan of a counteroffensive in Southeast Asia, but in reality, there have been no significant achievements to speak of. On the contrary, the elite Japanese army units stationed in Burma broke through the Indo-Burmese border, causing major threats to the Bengal-Assam railway, a vital artery in the area. This has caused absolute dissatisfaction from the United States and the Chongqing government. In order to placate this dissatisfaction, the enemy launched the attack on Sumatra. However, Sabang Island, the target of the enemy attack, is a small island located at the westernmost end of the Japanese-controlled area. Strategically, it is not very important. The enemy's propaganda claims to have achieved great results, but in reality, it is impossible to achieve great results in this strategically unimportant location. Furthermore, the enemy's attacking force is said to be a large fleet composed of battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, but in reality, the enemy fleet in the area is merely a collection of remnants of defeated ships from the Western Pacific and European theaters, with no real strength. The enemy's action will have absolutely no impact on the Japanese-Indian allied forces' liberation of India. If its purpose is to contain the Japanese-Indian allied forces in India, then even Mountbatten, as foolish as he is, would not launch such an attack, which would only be a futile waste of energy. Moreover, the enemy's Southeast Asia Army Headquarters has moved to Ceylon, and the enemy air force under General Manner is said to have moved from New Delhi to Calcutta, so the battle situation in the area seems to be gradually shifting from land to sea. The Japanese navy is currently considering all conditions and waiting for an opportunity. If the enemy dares to launch a large-scale offensive, it will be completely destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee Decides on Work Guidelines, Emphasizing Business Conditions and Capital Integrity <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – In order to investigate the actual situation of industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, with a view to promoting sound organization and increasing production, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has joined forces with the Shanghai Municipal Government to establish an Industrial and Commercial Enterprise Investigation Committee. The committee's internal personnel have been jointly appointed by the ministry and the Shanghai government, and prominent figures in the industrial sector have been invited to serve as members. It is reported that the committee's work will focus on investigating the business conditions of various enterprises, their internal situations, and related businesses. Therefore, the establishment of the committee is of great concern to all parties, and high expectations are placed on it. In order to understand the committee's future work guidelines and the specific assistance it will provide to industrial and commercial enterprises, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and inquired about everything. According to the official, "The ministry has noted that since the outbreak of the war, many industrial and commercial enterprises have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, especially in Shanghai. In order to establish close contact with various companies and enable them to develop normally with sound organization, the ministry will join forces with the Shanghai government and invite prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors to jointly organize this committee. Regarding the main tasks in the future, the first is to investigate the business conditions of companies, the integrity of their capital, and the situation after capital increases, to determine whether they are engaged in legitimate business or using speculative funds to manipulate hoarding and profiteering illegally. Therefore, in order to understand the truth, the ministry has distributed various forms to manufacturers for verification and will then provide assistance or make adjustments based on the situation. The ministry has also agreed with relevant parties to implement loans to enable them to purchase and store raw materials for continuous production. Otherwise, if the situation is not clearly investigated, unscrupulous elements may use these funds to fuel hoarding, which would harm society and the people's livelihood. Therefore, the main task is to investigate the content. Furthermore, regarding adjustments, the ministry is also planning to consolidate factories, such as match factories and soap factories, by considering the situation and encouraging them to merge in order to concentrate the electricity and materials of various factories and choose a factory with more favorable conditions to start production. In this way, production can be fully and continuously increased. The owners of the merged factories can also obtain considerable profits at the same time. This measure has now been implemented, and the factory owners have expressed their agreement. Therefore, it is expected that considerable results will be achieved in the future, not only avoiding the hoarding and manipulation of speculative funds but also actively increasing production to achieve a balance between supply and demand.</p>

<h3 id="e19">The Chongqing Side Encounters a Profound Crisis; The Solution to the CCP Issue <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Recently, Chongqing has gradually abandoned "democracy" and moved towards a dictatorial system, which has aroused discussion in American public opinion. Whether this move by American public opinion is a momentary disillusionment with "Free China" among American intellectuals, or a reflection of the intentions of the American authorities, is still unclear. However, this kind of American public opinion seems to have given the Chongqing authorities a considerable shock. Regarding this matter, Liang Han-tsao, Minister of Propaganda of the Chongqing government, said when recently meeting with foreign reporters: The Chongqing side is like a dilapidated house, and is now embarking on the path of</p>
<p>Democratic Nation</p>
<p>construction, so please forgive any imperfections. This proves that the Chongqing side has indeed been shaken. Even within the Chongqing regime itself, various criticisms have been made against Chongqing's undemocratic methods, which is truly eye-opening. At the same time, Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan of Chongqing, also expressed his opinion in a recent speech, saying that the Kuomintang has not been able to realize democracy in the past twenty years, and that the Kuomintang has lost its inherent characteristics and fallen into a domineering attitude and habit, strongly urging the authorities to reform this undesirable phenomenon. Because Chiang Kai-shek, in order to strengthen his dictatorial power, has fought with a small number of political enemies in the past, his</p>
<p>Fundamental Problem</p>
<p>in domestic affairs is how to handle the CCP issue. The CCP is deliberately demanding that the Chongqing regime thoroughly implement democratic politics. From Chiang Kai-shek's point of view, it is naturally reasonable to believe that the CCP is eager to usurp the Chongqing regime. At the same time, Chongqing's distress lies in economic difficulties. Foreign reporters recently pointed out the chaos under inflation, saying: The general public in Chongqing is extremely uneasy about their lives due to the economic chaos. It is worth noting whether Chongqing can implement democracy and grasp the power of control to alleviate the people's suffering. On the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek fears hurting the feelings of the United States, so Chongqing has no choice but to pretend to implement democracy. Given all these realities, Chongqing, one of the world's four major democracies, is indeed facing a profound crisis.</p>
<h3 id="e20">German Commentator Observes That the Invasion of Europe is Imminent; Britain Will Surely Reap What It Sows <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to Huitong News Agency, Pang Jiazi published an essay in the current issue of "Deutsche Wochenzeitung," stating that because President Roosevelt needs an overwhelming victory as a pretext for his re-election, because Churchill believes that an early end to the war is most beneficial to Britain, and because Stalin's means and insatiable greed are increasingly exposed, the three factors together determine that the timing of the invasion of Europe, which cannot be delayed beyond two months, has long been decided. The talk of invasion of Europe is no longer just enemy propaganda or a tactic for the anti-Axis forces to divert attention from their overwhelming difficulties. The author also raises a question that German newspapers have never touched upon before: "What will happen if the offensive fails?" The author answers that when the European countries that hope to restore the old order of 1939 with the help of Britain and the United States begin to collapse internally, the end of the opponents of the new Europe led by Germany will be at hand. Those who dream of relying on Britain to contain the Bolshevik surge and adopt a wait-and-see policy will awaken with a start. When the British witness the defeated troops returning home in a disheveled state, realizing that they are already powerless to deal with European affairs, how intense will the political and spiritual turmoil in their country be? After four and a half years of war, Britain has lost its world prestige and power. When it gains new allies, will it still be able to struggle to stand on its own?"</p>
<p>German Strategy</p>
<p>Pang then discussed the Eastern Front, saying in a tone that asks, "Is Germany's strategy this year to defend on the Eastern Front and fight quickly on the Western Front? After Germany has indeed eliminated the crisis on the Western Front, will it still move its troops eastward to determine the outcome? Or will it disregard the situation on the Western Front and directly attempt to settle the Eastern Front?" In answering these questions, the author insisted that anyone who does not judge the military situation based on gains or losses of territory would hardly believe that the situation on the Eastern Front is on the verge of despair. However, anyone familiar with modern military tactics knows that the Soviet Union has only recovered its lost territory and has not yet won a decisive victory over the German army. At any time, the German army has the possibility of challenging the Soviet army again, which is enough to show the combat power and courage of the German army. As for Germany's plans after the enemy collapses, the author believes that they are too extensive and should not be mentioned for the time being.</p>

<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels warned the people of Europe in yesterday's "National Weekly" that even if Britain and the United States want to fulfill their promise to save the people from communism, they are completely unable to do so. It is a great mistake to say that communists will not be able to control Europe after they win. Even if individual countries launch resistance attempts, their strength is insufficient, and they will inevitably be resolved, and their leaders will be exiled to Siberia. No one can believe the reassuring words of British and American diplomats to neutral countries, but neutral countries have to pretend to trust them in order to escape unpleasant realities. Under these circumstances, if Europe does not have Germany's existence, it will inevitably suffer the scourge of war. If Germany's resistance weakens or collapses, then I ask, is there any other country that can stop the Soviet army from expanding eastward?</p>

<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: The German army's resistance on the Eastern Front has strengthened. Except for the Crimea and the lower reaches of the Dniester, the Soviet army's offensive on all sections has weakened. The German army took the opportunity to counterattack, and the defensive lines they held have been improved, especially Narva and the Southern Route. The German army's counterattack in the area from Tallinn to Kovel (Delaynkovel) has caused considerable anxiety to the enemy. The German army's operations between Lutsk and Ternopil are already drawing to a close. A major battle is currently taking place between Stanisławów and Buczacz, which is of great strategic significance. The troops operating between the Carpathians and Ternopil have made progress towards Czernowitz and Skala. The Crimean war is intensifying, forming a battle for Sevastopol. The German and Romanian coalition forces are holding mountain positions, and repelling the invading enemy forces head-on very smoothly. It is still difficult to predict how it will develop.</p>
<p>Budapest, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch): Huitong News Agency: The Hungarian army's war report yesterday stated that the Hungarian mechanized infantry operating between Halych and Stanisławów, after occupying Nadworna, have made contact with the mountain troops operating northwest of Tallinn and the friendly forces advancing from Stanisławów. Responsible military officials told Huitong News Agency that the Hungarian army's counteroffensive against the Soviet army in the upper reaches of the Dniester River and the Carpathians is proceeding smoothly. The Hungarian troops that had been operating independently have made contact with the two forces, so the Hungarian united front has now been established in the Kolomea area. The Soviet army is now making a full-scale retreat to prevent the Hungarian army from continuing to advance. The Hungarian army headquarters expects the Soviet army to launch a counteroffensive within the month, but the Hungarian army has complete confidence.</p>

<h3 id="e30">The Open and Covert Struggle Between Britain, America and the Soviet Union <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The most prominent feature of the current international situation is the discord among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, and the difficult situation of Britain. The most blatant expression of the discord among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is the Soviet Union's formal recognition of the Badoglio regime. The opposition of Britain and America to the Soviet Union is precisely what the Soviet Union wants.</p>
<p>Britain and America initially thought that the Soviet Union was the most opposed to Badoglio. Churchill's statement said: "The British government supported the Badoglio regime before entering Rome." It still indicates that Badoglio will not be recognized in the future. According to the Manchester Guardian, the Soviet Union used this statement to instruct Italian communists to incite anti-British sentiment, and then suddenly recognized the Badoglio regime without consulting the British government, the Mediterranean Commission, and the European Commission. It is said that this was the plan of Vyshinsky, the Soviet representative in North Africa, and a manifestation of the Soviet Union's realistic diplomacy. When Roosevelt declared that the Italian fleet would be divided among the Soviet Union, Britain felt quite flustered, and opposed the move on the pretext that the Italian fleet would sink itself before extradition. The Soviet Union then recognized the Badoglio regime, expressing a friendly attitude, leaving Britain with no excuse.</p>
<p>The Mask of the Three-Nation Conference</p>
<p>British commentator Vernon Bartlett said in the London News Chronicle: "Because Britain and America want to allow Italy to withdraw from the war, they consulted with the Soviet Union to conclude an armistice treaty. The Soviet Union then formally recognized the Badoglio regime, which is incompatible with the armistice treaty."</p>
<p>The Times and other newspapers have also published similar arguments, saying that the interests and face of Britain and America have been completely overturned. Not only that, but the mask of the tripartite coordination advertised in the Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference has also been completely exposed. American newspapers have also unanimously criticized and attacked the Soviet Union's attitude.</p>
<p>However, the discord is not only among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, but also between Britain and America. America's threatening diplomacy towards countries such as Argentina, Spain, and Ireland has left Britain confused. If it succeeds, it is good, but if it fails, it will have no choice but to implement economic sanctions with the United States. However, in this way, it is Britain that is being blockaded. If Britain does not have meat from Argentina, zinc ore from Spain, and other things, it cannot endure it. However, the threatening diplomacy of Britain and America did not succeed, contrary to their expectations. This is because the credibility of Britain and America has been swept away, and the progress of the war has undermined their propaganda.</p>
<p>Excessive American Diplomacy</p>
<p>As for Britain's failure with Turkey, the Manchester Guardian said: "The failure of the Mediterranean front has hindered the establishment of Anglo-Turkish negotiations." Argentina did not accept America's demand for war against the Axis powers, and finally, under American pressure, President Ramirez formally announced his declaration of war, plus the recognition of the Farrell regime in Chile. Bolivia and Paraguay want to create a Pan-American bloc against American control. What is required of Spain is the complete withdrawal of volunteers on the Eastern Front, the transfer of Italian ships, the opening of the Tangier international zone, and the cessation of the supply of important materials to Germany. America is using material pressure, expecting to be able to succeed, but the situation has never materialized. The aforementioned Bartlett criticized the United States, saying:</p>
<p>Perhaps the action of suspending the import of meat from Argentina and zinc ore from Spain should be carefully discussed among Britain, America, and the Soviet Union before being implemented.</p>
<p>Criticism of Submitting to America</p>
<p>Regarding Ireland, British public opinion generally opposes following America and implementing economic sanctions. Britain and America also failed in the Finnish peace issue. The United States had already planned the Finnish peace last year, but it failed, and later Britain continued to work hard. Britain and America hoped that Finland would negotiate with the Soviet Union through Britain and America. However, the Soviet Union opposed advocating direct negotiations, and the Soviet Union and Finland disregarded Britain's efforts.</p>
<p>Roosevelt-Churchill New Talks</p>
<p>In response to the above situations, Britain and America have no choice but to seek new countermeasures. According to a Reuters dispatch from New York, Roosevelt and Churchill are preparing for new talks. It is said that the topics of discussion are the issue of recognizing the Badoglio regime after the occupation of Rome, issuing a new statement on postwar policies, unifying the various parties in the Southern Kingdom, and dealing with many political issues such as the countries that have withdrawn from the Axis.

<p>In order to promote the increase in cotton production in Central China, the Ministry of Industry, together with relevant organizations, each fulfill their responsibilities, mutually seek contact, discuss appropriate strategies for emergency cotton production, and implement and promote them, a cotton control committee, the Shanghai Yarn Factory Industry Association, the Shanghai branch of the Japanese Spinning Industry Association in China, the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association, the Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute, and other relevant organizations were convened to organize the Cotton Production Increase Coordination Council to discuss cotton production increase matters in various cotton-producing areas in Central China. The council has held meetings for several days to discuss preparatory matters, and they are now ready. The establishment meeting will be held at the Xingya Building on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month. The internal committee members will be two members selected by each organization participating in the organization, and the Minister of Industry will be the chairman. It is heard that after the establishment of the council, it also plans to establish "Regional Cotton Production Increase Agreement Councils" in major cotton-producing areas, and "Jiangbei Salt Reclamation Area Cotton Development Agreement Councils" in the Jiangbei salt reclamation area to handle cotton production increase matters in various regions. The list of committee members selected by the General Council is recorded below: Chairman Minister of Industry Chen, Vice Chairman Wen Lantao, Committee members Tong Lüqing, Tsutsumi Takashi (Cotton Control Council), Kōgami Yōichi, Chen Baochu (Yarn Factory Industry Association), Hishida Tsugu, Tomonaga Tōsaku (Japanese Spinning in China), Li Zuchu, Kobayashi (Cotton Production Improvement Association), Xue Xuesheng, Koike Katsu (Jiangbei Comprehensive Research Institute), Lin Qiming, Feng Junsheng (Cotton Industry Association), Horiyama Yasuo, Kamimatsu (Japanese Cotton Trade Association).</p>

<p>The 63rd issue of household rice in the first district of this city and the 38th issue in other districts within the blockade line all began to be sold publicly starting yesterday (21st), at a price of 23 yuan per person for two liters. However, the rations for this period have been delayed due to the relationship with the purchasing procedures, resulting in various outside rumors, and there are also rumors of price increases. This reporter specially visited the relevant authorities yesterday, and it was learned that all of this is baseless. The authorities only have the intention of increasing rations, and they have never even considered the issue of price increases, and subsequent allocations can still be distributed on schedule. In addition, a decision has been made to find ways to reissue overdue rations, so citizens do not need to panic or allow unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to profit.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Yesterday, Four Organizations Welcomed Japanese Minister Usami with a Grand Tea Party <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Usami, the newly appointed minister of the Japanese ambassador's office in Shanghai, has assumed his new position. The Shanghai Benefit Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the China Civic Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the New News Federation jointly held a reception yesterday (the 21st) at 4:00 PM at the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association on the Bund to welcome him. Many people from various circles in China and Japan attended the event enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Attendees:</p>
<p>Principal guest Minister Usami and Secretary Nakamide arrived punctually. Guests included Matsuhara, head of the Information Department, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Section Chief Xiong, Director Su of the Police Bureau, Chairman Funatsu of the four organizations, President Osako, Mr. Komura, Mr. Akamatsu, Mr. Hidaka, Wen Lantao, Hugh Kang Hou, Li Sihao, Yuan Shu, Zhao Jinqing, Xiang Kangyuan, Min Bonjun, Xu Guanqun, Ren Xiaochi, Li Fang, Xu Jianping, Huang Yuqi, Wu Yunxiao, Chen Riping, Chen Shaogui, Jin Zongcheng, Zhou Mengbai, Lei Xianzhi, Xu Liqiu, Lu Feng, Zhao Ruli, Ling Daqi, Ren Yunpeng, and over two hundred others.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address:</p>
<p>First, Chairman Wen Lantao gave a brief speech, stating: "Today, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Civic Welfare Association, the Civic Diplomacy Promotion Association, and the News Federation jointly welcome Minister Usami to take office in Shanghai. Minister Usami is an outstanding talent in the Japanese diplomatic world, with over thirty years of service and a long-standing reputation. Twenty years ago, he served as the Director of the Imperial Affairs Bureau of the League of Nations, already known internationally. In the 23rd year of the Republic, he came to China as Consul General in Fuzhou. When the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry was established the year before last, he served as the Director of the China Affairs Bureau, with great enthusiasm for Sino-Japanese cooperation. His appointment to Shanghai can be said to be a perfect fit. While expressing our sincere welcome, we hope that the Minister will treat each other with sincerity and promote the unfinished work of Sino-Japanese cooperation. Now, please Mr. Chen Binhe give a speech on behalf of us all."</p>
<p>Speech by President Chen of This Newspaper:</p>
<p>After the National Government returned to Nanjing, after China and Japan entered the war, after Japan implemented its new policy towards China, after China and Japan signed the alliance treaty, and after the Greater East Asia Conference issued a declaration, the meanings and spirits of all Sino-Japanese friendship terms such as Sino-Japanese cooperation, sharing joys and sorrows, and co-existence have long been determined and do not need further explanation and are no longer a problem. It can also be said that the entire destiny of East Asian co-prosperity and the destiny of Sino-Japanese cooperation have been determined and need no further explanation. The problem lies only in how to realize the "war participation," "new policy," "alliance treaty," "Greater East Asia Declaration," "Sino-Japanese cooperation," and "sharing joys and sorrows" to make them concrete and achieve common goals. If there are only good terms but they cannot be realized, they will become empty terms without underlying facts, and as time goes by, the general public will gradually become suspicious. Loss of faith due to suspicion is most dangerous. Therefore, we must urge both the Chinese and Japanese authorities to pay special attention to the issue of "implementation."</p>
<p>How to "implement"? Of course, it includes many issues. We believe that technical issues occupy a very important position. The editorial of the Shen Bao on the 17th welcomed Ogura, the supreme economic advisor, and said: "The main reason for the economic disease is poor politics, which should be reformed, but the technical aspects of economic measures are also very important. Especially when the principles and systems of economic measures have been determined, but must take into account the environment of adapting to national conditions and popular sentiments during implementation, measures are not immutable under the principle of not violating the wartime economy. For example, the system and principles of controlled economy are necessary for wartime countries, but when implemented in China, only its disadvantages are seen, and its benefits are not seen. China's implementation of control not only failed to stimulate production, but even hindered production. The reason is that it only knows how to swallow the principles whole and does not know how to adapt to the specific environment in terms of implementation technology." This needs to be repeated here. We believe that not only is this the case with the wartime economic control issue, but if everything related to Sino-Japanese cooperation has disadvantages and no benefits, or more disadvantages than benefits, the reasons should be studied. Why does it not work? It should also be thoroughly researched and remedied immediately. Therefore, if technical issues are not researched and resolved, and Sino-Japanese cooperation cannot be realized, the good intentions of the policy will disappear invisibly.</p>
<p>Shanghai's position is important, we have already said it, and the most important symptom of Shanghai's local disease is still the economic problem. Serious crises include soaring prices and declining production. Minister Usami is stationed in Shanghai and serves here, and he must already be keenly aware of the importance of Shanghai's position. The two economic crises of soaring prices and declining production must be well understood by the Minister. In that case, we hope that the Minister will provide special assistance in the technical aspects to find solutions to make Shanghai the economic center of the country and make contributions to the Greater East Asia War by integrating and leveraging economic power.</p>
<p>Finally, we know that Minister Usami is an outstanding talent in the diplomatic world of the allied nations. In the important position of Shanghai, in the complex environment, and in the face of the severe crisis, he will certainly be able to fulfill his mission of promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation by using his knowledge and experience within the scope of his duties.</p>
<p>Minister Usami's Speech:</p>
<p>Today, I am deeply grateful that the gentlemen of the four organizations in Shanghai have taken time out of their busy schedules to gather here for this grand welcome reception. Shanghai is the most important place for China's economy and culture, and it is also a place that has a closer relationship with Japan. My predecessor, Minister Tajiri, was honorably transferred to another position, and I am succeeding him with limited talent and shallow learning. On the one hand, I feel infinitely honored, and on the other hand, I feel a great responsibility. Before taking office, I served as the Director of the China Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and I have been handling matters related to China in Tokyo. Therefore, I am deeply concerned about enhancing Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation and the revival of China. I hope that the people of China and Japan can truly understand each other, be sincere, and cooperate closely to achieve the beautiful ideal of advancing towards the construction of a new East Asia. I am also prepared to do everything in my power to achieve this ideal. Regarding the various urgent issues at the moment, I am also prepared to observe the central policy, take into account the actual situation to determine the urgency, and gradually resolve them with mutual understanding and trust, and work with you to overcome this difficulty. I hope you will give me your full cooperation and assistance. In order to improve Sino-Japanese relations, the Japanese government first returned the concessions last year, revoked extraterritorial rights, and implemented resolute policies in politics and economics, sincerely cooperating with China. In short, the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty was concluded. The fundamental spirit of this consistent policy of Japan lies in restoring the natural state of relations between China and Japan, enabling China to restore its independent development of national power, and having China and Japan, the central countries of East Asia, jointly cooperate, eliminate the Anglo-American policy of aggression against East Asia for a century since the Opium War, establish a relationship of mutual trust and affection among the nations of East Asia, and move forward hand in hand, in order to establish a permanent foundation of coexistence and co-prosperity for all nations of Greater East Asia. Its spirit is exactly the same as the ideal of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration jointly issued by East Asian countries last year. The Japanese side has completely driven the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, which hinder the construction of a new order, out of East Asia, and is fully cooperating with China to eliminate all past international and economic constraints so that China can develop independently and enhance cooperation between China and Japan. Japan's policy will remain unchanged in the future, and it will continue to do everything in its power to cooperate and make efforts in accordance with the established policy. However, at the same time, what must not be forgotten is that in order to realize this ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity for all countries in East Asia, each country and each nation must bear its own responsibility and make its own full efforts. As you all know, so-called coexistence and co-prosperity, so-called cooperation, are all based on the revival and progress of each country itself. The so-called revival and progress of each country must first rely on the efforts of the people of each country themselves. This is a natural principle, and as far as China is concerned, I also deeply believe that so far, the various new measures of the Japanese side will be difficult to achieve the desired results without the active efforts of the Chinese officials and people. For example, how China utilizes the return of the concessions and the transfer of military-managed factories, and how to achieve substantial effectiveness, all depend on the efforts of powerful people on the Chinese side. In other words, the most important issue in the future is to see how China can fully utilize its new materials to establish the foundation for China's truly independent self-existence. The National Government has fully considered this point and has worked hard in the past. Recently, it has further clarified that correcting thinking, ensuring security, and increasing production are the important policies at present, and is actively working hard to revive the countryside, revitalize production and industry, purify officialdom, and stabilize prices. I still feel that the National Government's policies will be difficult to be effective without the cooperation of the people. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will fully recognize this point, cooperate with the government, and do your best to achieve the desired goals. It seems that I am saying too much in presenting this point. But because I love China and hope that China will be revived, I dare to make this expectation from the perspective of a friend of China, and I respectfully ask for your forgiveness. Moreover, the common war that we are waging to build Greater East Asia has entered the most intense decisive stage, and the prosperity of all countries in East Asia is tied to this. However, I firmly believe that Greater East Asia is gradually completing the goal of final victory in a sure-to-win and invincible posture. With this firm belief, we can generate the power to overcome all difficulties. Any country will inevitably have various spiritual and material difficulties during the war, which is a natural phenomenon, not only in China. I firmly believe that those who overcome the greatest difficulties will be able to achieve the greatest achievements. We must not be discouraged, pessimistic, or negative about the real difficulties, but actively persevere with courage and hope, and advance towards the completion of this great cause. Conversely, if we lose this hope and courage, East Asia will forever become a slave to the United Kingdom and the United States. Current issues, especially economic issues, are inevitably constrained by the wartime situation, and there must still be many difficult problems to solve. However, if we have sufficient creativity and thinking and make sincere and active efforts, I believe there will be a solution. Especially in Shanghai, which is an important city in China's political, economic, and ideological center, it is even clearer how much power the efforts of local social leaders have to solve problems and improve the situation. At the same time, Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is often called for today, and I believe there is much to be done by all of you. Regarding Sino-Japanese relations, your country's father once said: "With Japan, there is China; without China, there is no Japan." Chairman Wang also mentioned that it is a relationship of sharing joys and sorrows and living and dying together. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the Chinese people can follow this instruction, cooperate with each other to overcome difficulties and reach the glorious shore. I firmly believe that only with the cooperation and efforts of all of you and us can we shorten the current time of sharing hardships and bring about the soon-to-come sharing of joys. Finally, I ask all of you to give more cooperation and efforts under this belief. The above is just to express my feelings, in order to thank you for your kindness. Finally, Li Fang, a member of the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, gave a speech, and the event ended in joy at about six o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Burmese Representatives Arrive in Shanghai for the Third East Asian Medical Conference <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Third East Asian Medical Conference is scheduled to be held in Nanjing on the 25th of this month. Two special representatives from Myanmar, U Ba Than Hlaing, head of the Bureau of Sanitation of the Ministry of Education and Public Health of that country and Yangon, and U Mung Kan, Director of Public Health, departed from Yangon and arrived in Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM, they held a reception for Chinese and foreign reporters in the Shanghai Hotel on the 6th floor, and are scheduled to go to Nanjing tomorrow (the 23rd). According to Ba Than Hlaing and Mung Kan, there are six main topics for discussion at this conference, including lung disease, venereal disease, measles, bubonic plague, and serious infectious diseases. The conference will definitely play a major role in advancing medicine in Greater East Asia. They also said that Myanmar currently has two medical schools with more than 700 students. In order to meet wartime needs, the length of study has been shortened to five years in order to train a large number of medical talents. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the people of Myanmar have not only worked hard on construction, but also actively assisted neighboring countries in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. Myanmar is at the forefront, and there is a possibility of enemy air raids at any time throughout the country. However, officials and civilians across the country are responding to the enemy's frequent bombing with a fearless spirit. The government authorities have detailed plans for construction, but due to the impact of the war, they are gradually seeking to complete them as soon as possible. As for the cutting off of the Burma Road, it has no major impact on Myanmar itself.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Strong Internal Defense Line of the Japanese Army in the Pacific, Remarks by Director Matsushima <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The fleet press section of the Japanese army in Shanghai yesterday (the 21st), as usual, hosted a group of Chinese journalists, and gave a briefing. Director Matsushima, Lieutenant Ohta, the newly appointed Shanghai-based press officers Lieutenant Hirata, Liu Zhennan, and Wang Bingnan, attended. First, Lieutenant Ohta introduced Lieutenant Hirata to the reporters, and then Director Matsushima made an impromptu speech. The main points of his speech are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Second Front Will Become Concrete</p>
<p>The European second front will transform from a brewing situation into concrete reality. Regarding the preparations for this matter, we believe that the British government's announcement on April 17th to restrict the diplomatic activities of neutral countries is proof of this. What is most surprising to us is that this announcement also equally restricts the activities of the Chongqing regime's diplomatic personnel in the UK. This shows that the UK and the US, in addition to using Chongqing as their tool of sacrifice, have no other preferential treatment. Even if there is, it is only based on the interests of the UK and the US.</p>
<p>Chongqing's New Recruits Have Been Imprisoned</p>
<p>On April 19th, the Kunming correspondent of the US Associated Press cabled New York, saying that Chiang Kai-shek recently ordered the newly recruited soldiers to be separated from the old soldiers, and not to let them get close to the old soldiers. It seems that there is a meaning to prevent the old soldiers from escaping. This telegram proves that the Associated Press correspondent also has no good feelings towards Chongqing. He sent this unfavorable news to Chongqing, which shows his dissatisfaction with the Chiang regime.</p>
<p>Representatives of Chongqing's Army Were Killed and Injured in Bombing</p>
<p>According to a special telegram from New Delhi on April 10th: There was an explosion at the Mumbai pier, and General Wan Li, the representative of the Chongqing Southeast Asia General Headquarters, was killed, and Major General Chen Jingjia and another liaison officer were seriously injured. We express our sympathy to Chongqing for this sad event. The occurrence of this tragedy was due to the negligence of the British side's vigilance. Chongqing devoted its full spirit to serving the UK and the US, and the result was like this. In addition to sympathy, we feel especially pitiful.</p>
<p>Money Enslaves American Air Warriors</p>
<p>Regarding the fighting spirit of the American army in Europe, we can know it from the following facts. According to a telegram from Madrid: An American Air Force soldier landed in Madrid by parachute. He was born in Chicago. According to his confession, he can get a bonus of US$800 for each sortie. From this point of view, we know that the spirit of the American army's operations is all about money. They simply don't know how to fight for the country and the people, which is very lamentable and pitiful.</p>
<p>Sufficient Fuel for Victory</p>
<p>Regarding the Pacific war, it is still in a quiet state. The US has repeatedly promoted that it will launch a large-scale fleet to attack the Japanese army. The US's use of the island-hopping tactic will inevitably fail again, because the closer the US Navy gets to the Japanese internal defense line, the more difficulties it will encounter. For example, Japan's internal defense line is strong, and the US's sacrifice will be extremely large. In addition, the US has a long supply route, and each island in the middle is heavily defended. The problem of fuel for maritime operations cannot be solved smoothly. The Japanese side does not have the difficult conditions of the US Navy, especially regarding the fuel issue. The Japanese Navy is very well prepared and is very easy to solve, which can be said to be no problem at all. This can be proved by the recent "Japan-Soviet Northern Sakhalin Oil Concession Agreement." The Japanese Navy's abundant fuel is the way to victory. If the US Navy recklessly invades the Japanese internal defense line, it will suffer the same fate as the Russian fleet in the Baltic Sea that year. If the US military attempts to invade the Japanese internal defense line with the tactic of "one-shot operation", it is also impossible now, because it has no bases to use. If a ship is injured, it cannot be repaired and can only wait to be sunk. We often hear the US propaganda of large-scale offensives, but unfortunately the world is too big, making it impossible for them to succeed. On the contrary, the Japanese Navy's air force is becoming stronger and stronger, and we can wait and see when it will destroy the enemy in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Difficult to Start the War in the Indian Ocean</p>
<p>The success of the Japanese army in the operation in Imphal forced Mountbatten to move the headquarters to Ceylon, and the US Air Force moved to Calcutta. According to intelligence, a part of the enemy fleet is concentrated on Ceylon Island, with the intention of counterattacking Myanmar. We observe that the enemy fleet aims to contain the Japanese army's operations in Myanmar. If it is said to be a counterattack, then the strength is insufficient. The southwest monsoon in the Indian Ocean will arrive soon, and it is especially bad in July, which is not suitable for naval operations, which is obvious. The rainy season in Myanmar has also arrived, which is even more unfavorable for the enemy's operations. Therefore, we predict that the enemy's war propaganda in the Indian Ocean is just empty talk to cheer themselves up. The UK and the US have recently publicized that the Japanese army retreated because it suffered damage. The truth of this matter will be known in the second half of this year. In short, the Japanese tactics cannot be spied by the enemy, just like a big mountain is not hurt by a small stone, and a small mountain will roar wildly if it is hit by a big stone.</p>

<p>In this year's Junior Cup football match, there are 23 teams participating. Eastern China B, Huatong, Police No. 1, and Soquel are the four teams that advanced to the quarterfinal week.

The referee is Xuan Gu Zhengzhu. Huatong was unfortunately defeated by Police No. 2 by one goal in the second division of the Shanghai Federation. Today, the enemies will meet on a narrow road, and they will try to seek revenge. However, the strong player Meng Yiliang will follow the Friendship Team to the plains, and the strength will inevitably be weakened. After the match, there will be another friendly match, in which the Overseas Chinese United will play against Portugal.

<p>I, Chen Binhe, am grateful that my friends, both those I know and those I don't, visit me frequently. However, when you condescend to visit, I may sometimes miss you. When you entrust me with matters, I may sometimes neglect them. I feel deeply sorry for this. In order to reduce my sins, I plan to ask my friends for three things. I hope you will consider them:</p>
<p>My house is small, and I never dare to bother my friends to come. In the future, unless there is a special agreement, please do not condescend to visit. I am sorry that I cannot entertain you. If you have any business to discuss, please move to the Shen Bao and call in advance to make an appointment.</p>
<p>I, Chen Binhe, have always been talent-oriented, so I will never bend to personal feelings. I will never recommend people, especially to government agencies. In the future, if relatives and friends ask me to recommend them, I am sorry that I cannot comply. I will not reply to letters seeking employment.</p>
<p>Although I, Chen Binhe, often have contact with friends from allied countries, I am limited to official business. I will never ask for private favors. For example, my house is managed by the Japanese army, but I also pay a huge amount of rent to sublet it, which can be seen from this. If relatives and friends entrust me with requests for favoritism, I am sorry that I cannot comply. If you have been cheated or treated unfairly, please ask the Civic Welfare Association for help. Regardless of whether I know you or not, the association will handle it truthfully.</p>

<h3 id="e43">On Mr. Wang Jimei's Paintings <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>Painting has no other path, only lines and colors, striving to achieve the ultimate. However, the reason why Chinese painting surpasses Western painting is that it must also seek nobility and elegance. Therefore, the great master Bai Long, aka Wang Yiting, created a style that established an era. He truly founded his own school and became a master. Mr. Wang's lines are very rough, but they still retain the beauty of lines. What is the difference between roughness and refinement? As for his coloring, he mostly followed the ancients, and it was light and elegant, refined and not vulgar. After Mr. Wang's death, his son, Mr. Jimei, inherited his family's learning and worked hard to improve for thirty years as one day. Recently, he exhibited his recent works, more than one hundred pieces, at the China Academy of Calligraphy and Painting. With Mr. Wang's ultimate height, and Mr. Jimei also able to observe the art of modern times and understand the beauty of its coloring, and apply it to his brush, he not only retains the legacy of the Song and Yuan people, but also transforms it. Therefore, Mr. Jimei's dense and vivid paintings, resembling the Song and Yuan dynasties, surpass them. Mr. Jimei's recent works, such as the endless Yangtze River, willows and fishing boats, and mountain temple bell sounds, all show the antiquity and elegance, without the cleverness, sweetness, and vulgarity of modern times. Among the flowers and birds known for their coloring, there are peonies, bright pearls, orchids, lotus flowers, bald birds, rich and noble jade sparrows, small birds appreciating the late autumn, and many paintings of peonies and birds. Those who do not rely on coloring but show people with brush and ink are like the bare bamboo holding knots. The bamboo is flying and dancing, concise and refined, showing the depth of the skill. There are also those that are short and simple, but absolutely outstanding to read, such as magpies, decaying willows, and fragrant grasses. Often, even a single stroke cannot be added. In addition to lines and colors, Mr. Jimei can also make his works more perfect through the excellence of composition. Mr. Wang has many creations, and Mr. Jimei can not only retain his family style but also carry it forward. He will not let Nangong Bo and Mi Jia's father and son monopolize the beauty of the past. Mr. Wang's paintings will undoubtedly be even more valued by future generations.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Promoting Homespun Yarn and Cloth: Should Improve Wooden Spinning Machines <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Promoting homespun yarn and cloth in rural areas is indeed becoming popular for a time. However, once the goods have a market, farmers tend to produce them crudely and carelessly. This is a criticism of the farmers, but in areas such as Loutang in Jiading, my hometown, the homespun yarn is spun using wooden single-spindle machines, which are old-fashioned spinning wheels from decades ago. The output is low, the thickness is uneven, and the tensile strength is out of the question. These shortcomings must be addressed by improving the wooden spinning machines. Recently, I heard that in areas such as Pudong, Chongming, and Nantong, a "Improved Double-Spindle Wooden Spinning Machine" is producing yarn. I don't know how the results are. I hope local people will write reports to use for discussion and improvement. In Shanghai, there must be a small number of people studying and improving wooden spinning machines. I hope they can work together to research and conduct field experiments in cotton-producing areas such as Taicang and Jiading, and contribute an ideal and perfect wooden spinning machine. Then the future of the homespun yarn industry will be immeasurable! I hope people from all walks of life will carefully consider this. Then the society will be very fortunate! The nation will be very fortunate! (Zhu Shuxun)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Navy <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>In an instant, the gangway was placed on the shore, and the tide of humanity surged onto the ship.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the noise of conversation, the sound of footsteps, and the foreign fragrance of perfume filled the deck. The true people were stunned and mingled into the crowd.</p>
<p>"Are there any cadets from Kagoshima Prefecture? Cadets from Kake Bird Prefecture..." A man shouted loudly everywhere, seeming like an innkeeper soliciting business. This man was wearing a light gray suit and was a rather handsome middle-aged gentleman with beads of sweat on his forehead, walking and shouting like this.</p>
<p>With trepidation in his heart, the true person couldn't help but suddenly utter, "I am from Kagoshima."</p>
<p>"You are from Kagoshima?" the gentleman asked again, and immediately placed a large, soft, colorful garland on the true person's shoulder. It was a fragrant yellow garland. This was a symbol of blessing, and the true person felt quite embarrassed to wear it.</p>
<p>"Welcome, welcome! This is my name. I have lived in this place for fifteen years." The gentleman took out a business card, which was printed in English, and his title was doctor.</p>
<p>"Are there any other people from Kagoshima Prefecture?"</p>
<p>"There is another cadet named Kumazawa. He is on number eight."</p>
<p>"Please come with him, and I will definitely lead you on sightseeing tours everywhere. I will pick you up by car every day."</p>
<p>(Eight)</p>
<p>During the six-day berthing period, the true people had absolutely no free time except for visiting and being welcomed. It was strange, why did the local expatriates welcome themselves so warmly? It was really something that couldn't be figured out. The doctor from Kagoshima Prefecture drove his own car every day as usual, guiding them to visit inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>"There are so many Japanese people and Japanese shops!" the true person said to Kumazawa as the car sped along King Street. On the main streets and even in the remote alleys, as well as the places leading to Waikiki Beach, Japanese faces, shops and restaurants run by Japanese people could be seen everywhere. In one shop, the true person bought three leather handbags for his sister at home.</p>
<p>"But, there are 150,000 Japanese people in all of Hawaii!" said the doctor driving the car. Since the first immigration to that place during the Keio era, through the era of earning money, the era of settling down, and the era of becoming indigenous, up to the present day, the doctor explained these detailed circumstances.</p>
<p>"There are still old people from the first year of Meiji (1868) who came to Hawaii. As for the second and third generations, there are also people active in politics. This is truly a long history."</p>
<p>As if to confirm the doctor's words, the car passed in front of purely Japanese-style temples, shrines, and restaurants. On the roofs of Japanese tiles, golden shower tree flowers were intricately blooming, or adorned with coconut leaves, which felt a bit strange.</p>

<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association is raising funds for the education of war orphans. People from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated, and the results are considered satisfactory. Currently, over 1.5 million yuan has been raised, but it is still 500,000 yuan short of the target. This round of fundraising will end on the 30th of this month, with little time remaining. Therefore, the association earnestly hopes that all sectors will continue to assist in fundraising, so that the target can be reached as soon as possible. Then the benefits for war orphans will be truly significant. The association received a total of 152,010 yuan in donations this week, including 24,000 yuan from Zhang Xutang, 23,800 yuan from Qian Zhaoxing, 20,000 yuan from the Central Social Welfare Funding Committee, 20,000 yuan from Wu Shaowu (continued donation), 11,000 yuan from Wang Guanmei, and a total of 1,504,192 yuan including previous donations.</p>
