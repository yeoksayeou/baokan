<h3>明多羅南方海面擊沉敵艦船五艘　日大本營發表航空隊戰果</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日大本營十七日下午三時半發表：日軍航空部隊曾於十五日晚及十六日拂曉，攻擊菲律賓明多羅島南方之敵艦船，獲得下列戰果，轟沉戰艦或大型巡洋艦一艘，擊沉大型運輸船三艘，中型運輸船一艘。</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　際此雷伊泰島攻防戰展開一進一退之緊迫狀態時，敵軍又在菲律賓之深處西方明多羅島登陸，太平洋命運之菲律資決戰愈趨激烈，十三日以來，敵美以八十艘運輸船團，由有力艦隊護衛，自雷伊泰灣經由民答那峨海至蘇祿海，途中雖經日軍猛攻，受創甚重，仍强行北上，終於十五日晨以一師團兵力，在明多羅島西南桑霍塞地方登陸。日陸海軍航空部隊及特別攻擊隊大舉出動，連日猛攻敵運輸船團，予以重大打擊，同時敵登陸地點附近之日軍陸上部隊，立即展開激烈邀擊戰。按敵美已於雷伊泰島侵入大軍十五萬之衆，經日軍空陸一致攻戰力鬥，其乃受壓迫徒耗時日，並企圖推進基地空軍，然經日高千穗空輸部隊之挺身作戰，亦被搗亂，遂企圖打開戰局，乃於七日在奧爾莫克南方阿爾別拉地方以一師團登陸，同時於十四日突入蘇祿海明多羅島桑霍塞登陸，敵軍並以再編成之機動部隊出動呂宋島東方海面，以艦載機來襲菲律賓全域，日軍出以航空擊滅戰，驅走敵軍旺盛之戰意及物量之充分重壓。然敵力急謀打開雷伊泰戰局，刻正分散兵力，重復隨進作虎。至今日以我方言之，可調擊滅敵人之時機已至，敵方誇示其物量之優勢，然因長遠之補給路，且明多羅島位於日菲律賓航空要塞之中心，日航空兵力發揮其總力，遮斷敵補給路，使陷孤立，亦非難事。雷灣海面及菲律賓海面之海空戰，業經兩月，故漸已回復創　，再度傾其物量，反攻菲律賓，決戰愈凄烈，日方愈能本澈底滅敵信念，展開內綫作戰，追擊雷伊泰敵登陸軍，盡滅明多羅登陸敵軍，確立把握時機態勢。</p>
<p>各地日軍奮戰情形</p>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　日美兩軍之混戰情况誌次：（一）菲律濱方面，雷伊泰島之戰事，已於馬那嘉斯那斯比門附近以及布羅音附近激烈展開，同時，敵軍更於阿爾別拉附近登陸後，復於奧爾莫克附近展開戰鬥，膠着狀態之雷伊泰戰綫，頓呈活躍矣。爰敵軍爲急速打開雷伊泰島戰綫之膠着狀態，曾於五·六兩日，以艦船八十艘，自斯黎高海峽週四至卡麥泰斯海，圖以少數兵力佔領奧爾莫克，同時敵軍更爲把握菲律賓作戰之主力動機，復於十三日以有力船團突入蘇魯海。又敵機動部隊復出現於呂宋島東方海面，以艦載機二三百架，於十四，十五，十六三日，侵攻菲律賓北部，企圖牽制日空軍之活躍，十五日突於明多羅島桑霍塞附近出現，日軍陸上部隊及空軍，當對開始登陸之敵加以痛擊，目下仍展開激戰中。至此，菲律賓戰綫，已由雷伊泰方面更向西方擴大，因之，圍繞菲律賓羣島日·美兩軍之混戰，其規模亦愈形擴大。（一）日本本土方而，本月十三日來，馬利亞納敵基地方面之B29型機約八十架內外，曾分別空襲東京及愛知，靜岡兩縣地方，日方地上雖稍蒙損失，但經日軍制空部隊之邀擊，曾擊落並擊毀敵機十餘架，乃收得極大戰果，且敵B29型機歸還塞班島時，適逢暴雨，故亦受極大損失也。（一）培里琉，摩羅泰方面之摩羅泰島日空軍，其後曾運續對敵機加以攻擊，同時陸上部隊亦連日奮勇殺敵，而極力制扼敵空軍中繼基地之機能。自十月十六日，日軍部隊登陸以來，至十二月六日止，計斃敵二百九十除，炸毀營幕十所，又培里琉，安格維爾兩島之白烟及照明彈仍甚旺盛，斯乃昭示吾人，該方面日守軍續以還擊方式與敵人塵戰中也。（一）印度洋方面之英任命前遠東艦隊司令長官茀拉塞爲新設太平洋艦隊司令官，此當爲補足美國消耗之艦隊。（一）中國方面之日軍，自打通大東亞縱斷路後，刻繼續擴大戰果中。（一）緬甸方面之陸空兩戰均甚活躍，敵軍蠢動亦益明顯。（一）北方方面，北方戰綫因天氣不良關係，故敵軍甚爲沉寂。</p>
<h3>高千穗部隊　奇襲敵側背　日機轟炸雷島兩機塲</h3>
<p>菲律賓前綫基地十七日中央社電　本月六日，在雷伊泰島布羅音機塲及其他處所激行奇襲降落高千穗部隊之一部，七日來，連日以齋田部像長麾下之有力各隊，在雷伊泰島西岸奧爾莫克周圍數處，連續實施落下作戰，與地上部隊協力，對自阿爾別拉上陸攻擊奧爾莫克之敵軍，舉行奇製，攻其側背，壯烈舊戰累建偉功。</p>
<p>菲律賓基地十六日中央社電　日空軍十三日夜往炸雷伊泰島塔克羅班及塔拉克兩機塲，計各炸碎數處。</p>
<h3>緬甸日軍　戰果擴大中</h3>
<p>緬甸前綫十七日中央社電　日軍部隊於那米尼（那姆加恩西北二十八公里）與自八莫舊滇緬公路向那姆加恩南下中之渝軍第三十師主力遭遇後，九日以來，對據守陣地之渝軍展開猛攻，予以甚大損害，並逐漸向西北方壓迫中。自九日至十三日，渝軍所受之損害計遺棄屍體五百具，人員損傷達一千五百名，被鹵獲各種火砲彈藥多數。此外，爲期覆滅包圍八莫中之渝軍新編第三十八師，自那姆加恩方面出動之日軍及沿八莫孟多公路北上增援之日軍，亦於十日於西島（八莫南方五十公里）附近，對企圖南上之渝軍新編第三十二師之一部展開攻擊，渝軍損傷達五百以上，目下對抵抗中之渝軍仍猛攻中。本月十日，日空軍與海上部隊協力，對阿冽桑沃渝軍事據點，敢行猛攻，是役，確認渝軍遺棄屍體爲九十六具，被破壞之火砲及大汽車各三，倉庫營舍起火者十處以上。十一日白晝，渝軍携帶大砲五六門復行來攻，日軍當即將之擊退至阿列桑沃地區。又其他一部日軍，亦對於門多附近構築陣地抵抗之渝軍敢行奇襲，戰果逐漸擴大中。</p>

<h3>雷伊泰灣海戰續誌</h3>
<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>十月中旬某日正午相近，日本航空母艦〇〇號的高射砲，突然吐火。在很高的白雲中，飛來了敵方的偵察機。經日方猛烈邀擊以後，即刻逃入白雲中，但日方的直衛機絲毫不肯放鬆，追踪其後，如影隨形。</p>
<p>敵機巳經與日艦隊接觸過了。是日，鹽田司令長官對全軍發下「確信天佑，全軍突擊」的攻擊令。這是待之已久的命令。全體將士，無不意氣軒昻，熱血沸騰，個個摩拳擦掌，立誓擊滅敵軍。</p>
<p>雷伊泰灣大戰</p>
<p>一夜無事，翌日便是待望着的全軍突擊之日。是日，戰塲上空，萬里無雲，但風浪依舊很大。天色未明時，日海上部隊即突破近島的水路，突然出現於雷伊泰灣內，衝入灣內敵艦艇羣的正中，敵陣大亂。接着，日軍部隊的巨砲吞噬了敵方航空母艦，戰艦，巡洋艦及其他艦艇等六十餘艘，而且戰果繼續擴大。某部隊衝入運轍船團，某部隊殺入護衛艦艇羣中，敵艦紛紛在日方怒吼的巨砲前毀滅。</p>
<p>日方突入部隊的敢死肉搏，卒告成功。在無可名言的欣喜中，全體將士的士氣，更爲高揚。不過，中計的敵軍定將傾其空軍力量，向日艦隊挑戰，所以日方全軍嚴密戒備，準備邀擊。果然，到了〇點鐘，對空戰鬥配置的喇叭聲大作。在發見敵方偵察機後，相隔〇十分鐘，從左面三十度的方向機來了敵機大編隊，同時在二十度的方向，又發見四大羣，艦隊於是迅速散開，作成嚴密的對空航行序列，護衛航空母艦的艦艇，紛紛出動。突然，日戰艦的主砲吐火了。轟隆隆，巨彈射入敵機羣中，敵機當被驅散。同時，高角砲也咆哮起來，機關槍也連珠似地嘷着。頃刻間，上空祗見白烟和亂飛的敵機。在必中的猛烈砲火中，敵機紛紛墜下，有的好像風捲落葉，有的突在空中分解，四散如燃燒的紙片</p>
<p>這當兒，敵機集中攻擊日航空母艦羣。在水柱此起彼落之中，日航空母艦沈着應戰。我直衛艦的舷側，也有數發至近彈，掀起了很大的水柱。在這水烟交織中，機關槍的槍身，也熱得利害。</p>
<p>突然，航空母艦的近處，一枚魚雷拖需白尾像箭一般射來，我護衛的驅逐艦〇〇號開足馬力，向魚雷和航空母艦之間疾駛。轟然一聲，本來將可命中航空母艦的魚雷，撞入了驅逐艦的艦腹，〇〇號當即彼赤色的火焰及島黑的濃烟所籠罩，但其前部的砲塔，依然向着敵機吐火。之後，又是一聲巨響，全艦炸成粉碎。驅逐艦〇〇號是獻身保全了航空母體。</p>
<p>此日，敵機的襲擊非常固執。蔽空的大編隊反復來襲，至黃昏時止，先後不下五次。我艦隊在敵機猛烈的魚雷和炸彈的集中攻擊之下，浴血奮戰，擊下敵機不少，但航空母艦〇〇號亦不幸中彈沉沒</p>
<p>夜襲大敗敵艦</p>
<p>夕陽西傾時，敵機終被擊退。南海的天空，鮮紅如血，宛如這次慘烈的海空戰的標幟。分爲數　的我艦隊，至此便重行集結起來。轉戰洋上的航空母艦〇〇號，此時已不能再見其雄姿了。悲壯的空氣籠眾着整個艦隊。突然，好像打破這種滯重的空氣一樣，旗艦上面發出閃閃的信號光。</p>
<p>「全軍即刻敢死夜襲敵艦隊，務必擊滅之！」</p>
<p>啊，這種百折不撓的敢鬥精神，多麼令人感嘆！在血肉續飛的慘烈戰鬥中，雖然有了犧牲，仍不放鬆攻擊。這種見敵必殺的傳統精神，使全體將士一致奮起，生出新的鬥志</p>
<p>當時，日主力部隊即在前鋒驅逐隊之後，列成一絲不亂的單縱陣，在黑暗的海上疾進。天空，羣星閃鑠，不時有流星曳着一條長尾，橫過空中。</p>
<p>深更時分，在日艦隊的前方，暗夜焦雷的閃光，忽現於低垂的雲間。接着，隱隱傳來了遠雷似的砲聲。一閃又一閃，原來日方快速的驅逐隊已和敵軍前衛的艦艇交鋒了。爲日本海軍傳統的壯烈肉薄夜襲戰，於是展開。可是，數分鐘後，海上復歸於原有的靜寂。這次夜襲戰，至少擊沉了敵巡洋艦一艘，並命中了其他敵艦。可惜當日主力到達戰塲時，已在敵軍倉皇向南方退擊之後，因而祗好收軍北上。</p>
<p>這樣，戰史上永垂不朽的菲島海面海戰便在日方的勝利聲中結束。由於此次海戰，敵人的海上部隊，沉毀甚多，此爲其後雷伊泰灣海空陸作戰的重大轉機。（寄自東京）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論食米對策</h3>
<p>前天我們論列食米對策，提出幾點治標與治本辦法。我們認爲食米價格，如果嚴厲取締亂喊亂抬，投機操縱，可以回低的，這是過去的經騐。這次米價飛漲，當然有很多原因，可是奸商操縱，小販亂喊，實爲王因。尤其是一部分縣區郊區的米商，操縱其間，遂致瘋狂不可收拾。所以，我們「論食米對策」的一文中，主張嚴密管理米價，絕對不能採取放任態度</p>
<p>怎樣嚴密管理呢？依照目前的環境，簡而易行的，我們主張先實行兩事。</p>
<p>（一）集中零售交易·使零星負販分區集中一處或數處，禁止沿途喊賣，俾便於管理。售出價格經公定後並由當局核准，不得任意漲價。公定價格之規定，顧到成本與合理利潤。譬如目前負販食米，在產地收買成本，假定每斗爲一千五百元，沿途勒索自應予以取締，但姑且退一步言，縱使有此不合法事實存在，則沿途勒索每斗以五百元計，成本每斗爲二千元，給予利潤每斗五百元，則總數每斗不過二千五百元。假定即以此數爲公定價格，經關係當局核准後，在賓際成本未曾增加以前，不許漲價。</p>
<p>（二）分區聯合收買。在食米負販進口附近地區，設立聯合收買處，准許臨近登記米店參加。譬好曹家渡·徐家滙·周家橋等地，設置聯合收買處，由政府關係機關派員監督，規定合理價格，收買入口負販食米，每日收買數量，報告米統會及市府主管機關，然後以平價售給市民。但是項平價發售，規定最高數量，不得任意多購，以防囤積。同時，對於富有者不予售給，僅限於薪水階級，勞動者及一般平民，根據市民證所塡職業酌量辦理。</p>
<p>上項辦法，可以同時並行。負販願入集中市塲或售給聯合收買處，可以自由。但禁止沿途亂喊。這兩個辦法。還是提供原則，如果富局認爲可行，自應再予嚴密考慮具體辦法，立刻實施。</p>
<p>這次米價暴漲，無疑是奸商有計劃的行動，促成一般物價莫不倍漲。有人說，本市物價越抑越不平。實際上是經濟機構職權的不統一，法令的不嚴密。過去的鬆弛凌亂，養成了奸商的野心，毫無忌憚，爲所欲爲。如果對於操縱物價者，囤積居奇者，公務人員假名作弊者，經查有實據後，採取最嚴厲的懲處，重者槍決，輕者徒刑，並游街示衆，予不法之徒以無情的刑罰，殺一儆百，則操縱者自具戒心，物價必可平靜。反之，如果僅僅以罰欵了事，徇情通融，則若輩野心難戢，物價自然難平。總之，目前的米價已非經濟問題，超越了經濟範團，而是治安問題，因此，對於這般奸商應以治安的法律制裁，才有效果。</p>
<p>最後，我們更希望米統會當局盡量疏通米源，使戶口米配給準期。同時，我們知道盟邦日本食糧配給的優點，在於適量而平均，不予太飽，但不致餓死，完全爲適應戰時生活。滿洲國及華北各地都吃雜糧，所以，一般市民應該搭吃維糧，滅少浪費，以適應環境。</p>
<h3>爲完成建國偉業盼盟邦全力協助　陳院長向日國民廣播演講</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　國府陳行政院長於十七日下午七時二十分，對全日本國民作廣播講演，申述中國決本人民之夙願，國父之主義，與汪主席之遺志，勇往邁進，求中國自身之解放戰之完成，期予以助力，使中國得致力於大東亞戰爭，完成汪主席遺志。其廣播全文如次：</p>
<p>親愛的日本國民們：本人今日又得在東京向着諸位廣播，不期然發生異常親摯之感，同時，又深覺非常榮幸。本人這次到東京正式訪問，自從國民政府還都後，已是第三次了。第一次是於國民政府還都之後，在民國二十九年五月，奉汪主席之命來貴國答禮，第二次是於國民政府參加大東亞戰爭之後，在去年四月奉汪主席之命來貴國訪問，現在是第三次，而汪主席於上月十日逝世以後，再沒有他的指導了，我有着無限的悲痛，更覺自己責任的重大，希望日本朝野站在同盟國的地位和友誼，予中國以協力。</p>
<p>回憶汪主席於本年三月初旬東渡至貴國養疴，荷蒙貴國朝野異常關懷，異常優待，敝國舉國人士無不異常感激，貴國的熱誠高誼，我們永遠不忘，今天於比代表中國人民謹向諸位致其無限的謝意。</p>
<p>繼承前人遺志</p>
<p>汪主席逝世了，我們感着失了領袖的指導，同時更感着他的遺志必須實現。</p>
<p>汪先生所遺下的和平反共建國之大政策，這是奠定中日永遠合作的基礎。今年元旦他所指示的肅正思想增加生產確立治安，這是鞏固大東亞戰爭後方的方針，以後當本着他所昭示，與貴國同甘共苦以至同生共死的決心。我們後死者必須肩起責任，使其一一實行，以期無負汪主席的遺志，並以實現國父的大亞洲主義。</p>
<p>於此有必須於今日鄭重吿之諸君者，第一，大東亞戰爭必須完成，這是國民政府的決意，國民政府於民國十二月八日日本展開大東亞戰爭之時，即以決心參戰。</p>
<p>信念決不動搖</p>
<p>這次參戰是自動的，因爲中國久已受英美帝國主義之侵略，中國百年來渝爲半殖民地的地位，完全以鴉片戰爭　其端，故反對英美帝國主義爲中國國民的夙志。我們力求本身的解放，並求同其運命之東亞各民族解放，我們參戰是基於正義，人道以及友誼的立塲，今後無論戰爭如何推移，時局如何迫切，必將本於人民的夙願，以及國父孫先生的主義，汪主席的遺志，一往無前，決不動搖，決不萎退。</p>
<p>致力推時和平</p>
<p>第二，中日雙方必須合作，以奠定大東亞之基礎，國民政府還都的目的，一面揭示中日和平，一面更加努力於推進中國全面和平，而且當日還都的目的，尙不以中日和平爲滿足，且進一步而蔪求中日之永久合作，中國更不揣棉薄，期能分担東亞的責任，現在雖然重慶還有一部份人不了解此旨，但國民政府必須繼續努力使之明瞭，使之了解，以期無負汪先生當日還都南京的偉願，並無負於當日中日有志之士共同戰力的最大目標。</p>
<p>兩國休戚與共</p>
<p>我要告訴諸位的懷抱太多了，今日不過擇要以陳述中日兩國的利害，和平和安危，今日已至不可分的時期，世界人類之能使東亞各國之脫離殖民地之地位，中國和其他大東亞民族之解放，胥繫於此一戰，中國的力量是有限的，本人的能力更是有限，深望貴國朝野予以助力，使中國得以致力於大東亞戰爭，使吾人得以完成汪主席遺志，是則尤可企禱與感謝者也。</p>

<h3>陳院長在日　對記者談話</h3>
<p>東京十七日中央社電　國府陳行政院長十六日上午十一時，於此間迎賓館會見記者發表談話如次：在未宣佈個人意見之前，本人欲向各位轉達中國朝野對於貴國無限忻賀之忱。</p>
<p>對盟邦致謝忱</p>
<p>其一，自汪先生於本年三月來貴國就醫，蒙天皇陛下之優渥禮遇，各大臣之熱意款待，醫生護士之盡瘁看護，以及民間之特別關切，自中日兩國外交史以來，爲創睦誼之表現，殊使中國朝野衷心感動，此應向貴國朝野表示謝意者一。其二，自中國於去年一月參加大東亞戰爭以後，同年三月間即蒙貴國自動交還租界，及聲明撤廢治外法權，並協力我國收回各國之在華租界公共租界，以及撇廢辛丑條約之駐兵權，使中國得以完全獨立目由，使國父孫先生廢除不平等條約之遺言與大亞洲主義，得以實現，更使汪主席數年來與貴國合作之精神與效果，得以大白於天下。貴國對世界之正義，對中國之友誼，所謂披露無遺，由此不獨中國可以解放，即大東亞各民族亦可解放，此應向貴國朝野表示謝意者二。</p>
<p>協力解放戰爭</p>
<p>至於本人今日願對各位先生聲明者，對於汪先生之逝世，吾人感着無限之悲悼，同時充其悲悼之忱，發爲勇毅之氣，以完成汪主席之遺志，吾人必始終與貴國更緊密合作，以完成大東亞戰爭。蓋中國成爲列强之次殖民地，百年以前以鴉片戰爭肇其端，故反對英美帝國主義，爲中國四萬萬五千萬人民之大志。辛亥革命雖未明示反對英美帝國主義，但原因以受英美帝國主義之侵略，人民崛起，先圖改革內政，次即急謀自存報國，國民黨於民國十三年改組，更掃去以前模糊觀念，明白標示反對英美帝國主義，以求中國之自由平等，故國民政府之參加大東亞戰爭，純粹代表全國人民之志願，實行國民黨之黨綱，對於成敗利鈍，初非所計，今後或者戰事再有推移，時局或更迫切，吾人野信國民政府朝堅決不因此動搖。貴國之領導大東亞戰爭，爲正義而戰，爲解放大東亞各民族而戰，敝國之參加大東亞戰爭，亦爲正義而戰，更爲本身之解放而戰，正義所在，決無猶疑，困難雖多，不變初旨。</p>
<p>經濟尙未健全</p>
<p>復由中國經濟之基礎，現在尚未健全，此次訪問貴國，擬就種種問題與貴國懇談，尤其重要之問題，爲經濟問題之檢討，甚望關於軍需與民需之調整·生產之增强·金融問題·物價抑平等兩國協力解決，以發揮總力戰之效果。今日中日利害相同，安危相共，兩國關係實屬不可分離，安定中國即安定東亞，亦即安定大東亞戰爭之大後方，尙希諸位注意，以全力協力國民政府。本人此次東來，獲貴國人民對大東亞戰爭必勝之信念更强，殊使吾人感覺無限興奮，吾人惟有本於汪主席與日本由同甘共苦，以至同生共死決意勇往邁進，以慰汪主席在天之靈，及慰人民要求中國自由獨立之夙願也。</p>

<h3>抑平米價高漲　正謀有效措置　以求標本兼治制止漲風</h3>
<p>滬市金融與工商各業市况，上週間續起劇烈之變化，動盪之盛爲今年以來罕見，社會民生不安狀態已達於極點，尤以米糧黑市價格飛漲急厲，情形頓趨混亂之象，其中最大原因，固由於投機商人故放無稽流言，乘機操縱居奇，高抬市價企圖暴利，但有關經濟當局對於民生主要必需日食用品不能澈底平衡調劑，而使民食恐慌，益趨嚴重，影響其他物資價格繼起上升。上週間金融方而無日不在演進騰高，烚赤一動即高數萬元，早市與午市行情起伏甚鉅，紋銀　升百分之三十以上。華股挺堅繼而不回，多頭把持不願吐售，而散戶亦在吸收不已。拆息錢業掛牌五角未更，而同業拆借每元月息一角五分，尚不易獲得頭寸，而擁有資金者，不顯拆放，羣向購買物資，是以直接刺激物價高漲。工商方面，各業工廠斷電後，尚未獲得動力恢復開工，因而生產前途殊堪憂慮。且同時米價飛漲不已，民生岌岌可危，各業工商廠號存積貨物，均以奇貨可居，擅自抬高售價，甚至藏而不售，所有民生有關之米煤油糖柴雜糧以及其他棉織品日用品市價，無不在急劇之漲風中。聞本市各有關當局及各業統制團體，對於米糧調劑供需抑平售價，設法補發戶口米等問題均在緊急討論治本治標辦法，尅日即可解決，付諸實施。預料米價暗市刻日將大爲傾跌，希市民勿過自相驚擾。同時並希望經濟有關當局速謀切實有效措置，肅淸投機份子，物價方有抑平希望。</p>

<h3>請本市僧道　致力社會福利事業</h3>
<p>— 周毓英</p>
<p>民國二十二年，政府頒布寺廟興辦公益慈善事業實施辦法，規定全國寺廟，應按其廟產收入，提成舉辦公益慈善事業，旣足以發揚宗敎精神，復能協助政府推行社會政策，用意至美。然自該項辦法頒布施行後，各地寺廟，奉行者雖亦不少，然大多陽奉陰違，有名無實，能稍具規模或成績者更不多見。夫佛以大我爲本方便爲門；道則淸靜無爲，救已救人，爲僧道者，自當勞其筋骨，堅其志向，存普渡濟世之念，行社會服務之事，決非終日誦經念佛，即能了事。反觀耶敎旨在博愛，其牧師敎徒，大都能致力於社會事業，所辦之學校醫院以及戰時設難民區等咸足表現基督精神；更如天主敎之修女，除致力修身養性外，復舉辦育嬰堂托兒所養老院等，朝夕工作，始終不懈，口碑載道。爲奉行法令，發揚宗敎計，今後各地僧道，務必捐棄成見，掃除舊習，自動努力社會福利事業，庶能挽救於未來。本市寺廟僧徒之衆，廟產財物之富，甲於全國，倘能急起直追，致力社會福利事業；則一呼百應，各地必能競相仿效，其收效之宏，可以想見，而佛敎道敎，亦必能賴以日見光明也。</p>
<p>社會神利事業，種類甚多，範圍亦廣；行之不當，則事倍功半，甚或中途而輟。本市寺廟如舉辦社會福利事業，首應注重社會需要，以積極性事業着手，更應擬妥詳細計劃，呈請官應備案，每一事業之舉辦，經費必須自籌百分之八十以上，人事方面，以本寺僧道自行分担爲佳，不必另聘他人，如本寺人力財力不敷支配，不妨聯合鄰近寺廟會同辦理，俾能持久。茲略舉本市寺廟能興辦之社會福利事業如左：</p>
<p>（一）平民食堂　本市各寺廟所收僧徒，多則數百，少亦數十，其原有之廚房食堂以及飲食用具，自必具備，如利用原有器具，舉辦平民食堂，困難必少。倘因與本寺用餐衝突，可將三餐提早，必無妨礙。此項平民食堂，可倡用素食，以符佛敎愛護衆生本旨，至於食米，縱求諸黑市亦可，但求其售價低廉有益衛生而已。</p>
<p>（二）小本貸款　本市多數寺廟，收入甚豐，倘能提出若千，派員負責辦理小本貸款，手續並不麻煩。此項貸款，定有限額，分期舉行，亦可酌收利息，能採信用方式爲佳，更可以歸還之款項，仍供出借之用，川流不息，則平民小販，受惠極多。</p>
<p>（三）職業介紹　寺廟施主，頗多富戶及地位較高之人，如各廟住持，能利用機會，爲若干確有能力之失業人士，推薦介紹，則輕而易舉，成就亦多，故不妨先舉行職業登記，繼以介紹，因才就地，各施主必樂於接受。</p>
<p>（四）濟良所　本市以情形特殊，多數淪洛婦女，未能自拔。如本市各女尼庵堂，酌撥房屋，辦理濟良所，必能拯救多數可憐婦孺，所內由女住持主辦，施以生產訓練，使能自食其力，因不必依賴他人救濟也。</p>
<p>此外如夏日施茶，冬日施粥等臨時振濟，均可酌量辦理。總之，本市各寺廟以其本身多餘之人力物力財力及時間，興辦各項社會福利事業，能切實辦理，持之有恒，收效必宏，且宗敎辦得因而發揚光大，政府及社會，均　以無限之期望焉。</p>

<h3>Five Enemy Warships Sunk South of Mindoro; Japanese General Headquarters Announces Air Squadron Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 17th that Japanese air units, in attacks on enemy warships south of Mindoro Island in the Philippines on the night of the 15th and dawn of the 16th, achieved the following results: one battleship or large cruiser sunk, three large transport ships sunk, and one medium transport ship sunk.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - As the battle for Leyte Island unfolds in a tense back-and-forth state, enemy forces have landed on Mindoro Island in the western depths of the Philippines, intensifying the decisive battle for the fate of the Pacific. Since the 13th, enemy Americans, with an 80-ship transport fleet escorted by a powerful naval force, passed through Leyte Gulf, the Mindanao Sea, and the Sulu Sea. Despite heavy attacks by Japanese forces, they suffered severe damage but still forced their way north, finally landing a division-sized force in the San Jose area of southwestern Mindoro Island on the morning of the 15th. Japanese army and navy air units and special attack squadrons mobilized on a large scale, launching daily fierce attacks on the enemy transport fleet, inflicting significant blows. At the same time, Japanese ground forces near the enemy landing site immediately launched fierce interception battles. It is reported that the enemy Americans have already invaded Leyte Island with a large force of 150,000 troops. After fierce fighting by Japanese air and ground forces, they have been subjected to pressure, wasting time, and attempting to advance air bases. However, they were disrupted by the courageous operations of the Japanese Takachiho Air Transport Unit. They then attempted to break the stalemate, landing a division on the 7th in the Albea area south of Ormoc. Simultaneously, on the 14th, they broke into the Sulu Sea, landing in San Jose on Mindoro Island. The enemy also deployed a reorganized mobile unit off the eastern coast of Luzon Island, using carrier-based aircraft to attack the entire Philippine region. The Japanese responded with aerial annihilation warfare, driving away the enemy's vigorous will to fight and the ample pressure of material. However, the enemy is urgently seeking to break the Leyte battle stalemate and is currently dispersing forces, repeatedly following and attacking. As of today, from our perspective, the opportunity to annihilate the enemy has arrived. The enemy boasts of its superiority in material resources, but due to the long supply lines, and Mindoro Island being located at the center of the Japanese-Philippine air fortress, it is not difficult for Japanese air power to exert its full strength, cut off enemy supply lines, and isolate them. The naval and air battles in Leyte Gulf and the Philippine Sea have been going on for two months, so they have gradually recovered from the damage and are once again pouring in their material resources to counterattack the Philippines. The decisive battle is becoming more fierce. The Japanese are increasingly able to thoroughly eliminate the enemy by firmly establishing the belief, launching internal line operations, pursuing the enemy landing forces on Leyte, completely annihilating the enemy landing forces on Mindoro, and establishing a posture of seizing the opportunity.</p>
<p>Situation of Fierce Battles by Japanese Forces in Various Locations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - A record of the mixed battle situation between Japanese and American forces: (1) In the Philippines, the battle on Leyte Island has fiercely unfolded near Managasnaz Beach and near Burauen. Simultaneously, after the enemy forces landed near Albea, they also launched battles near Ormoc. The stalemated Leyte front has suddenly become active. The enemy, in order to quickly break the stalemate on the Leyte Island front, used 80 ships on the 5th and 6th, from Surigao Strait around to Camotes Sea, attempting to occupy Ormoc with a small force. Simultaneously, the enemy, in order to seize the main driving force of the Philippine operation, broke into the Sulu Sea with a powerful convoy on the 13th. Enemy mobile units also appeared off the eastern coast of Luzon Island, using 200-300 carrier-based aircraft on the 14th, 15th, and 16th to invade northern Philippines, attempting to contain Japanese air force activity. On the 15th, they suddenly appeared near San Jose on Mindoro Island. Japanese ground forces and air force immediately launched a fierce attack on the enemy who had begun landing, and fierce fighting is currently underway. As a result, the Philippine front has expanded westward from the Leyte area. Consequently, the scale of the mixed battle between Japanese and American forces surrounding the Philippine archipelago is also expanding. (2) On the Japanese mainland side, since the 13th of this month, about 80 or so B29-type aircraft from enemy bases in the Mariana Islands have separately attacked Tokyo and the prefectures of Aichi and Shizuoka. Although the Japanese side suffered some losses on the ground, Japanese air defense units shot down and destroyed more than ten enemy aircraft, achieving a great victory. Moreover, enemy B29-type aircraft suffered great losses when returning to Saipan due to heavy rain. (3) Regarding Peleliu and Morotai, the Japanese air force on Morotai Island has continued to attack enemy aircraft, while ground forces have also fought bravely against the enemy day after day, striving to control the function of the enemy air force's relay base. From the time Japanese troops landed on October 16th to December 6th, they killed over 290 enemy soldiers, destroyed ten camps, and the smoke and flares on the islands of Peleliu and Angaur are still very strong, indicating that the Japanese garrison forces in that area are continuing to fight the enemy in a counterattacking manner. (4) In the Indian Ocean, the British appointed former Far East Fleet Commander Fraser as the commander of the newly established Pacific Fleet, which is intended to replenish the fleet consumed by the United States. (5) In China, the Japanese army is continuing to expand its battle results after opening up the Great East Asia Transverse Road. (6) Both land and air battles are very active in Burma, and enemy movements are becoming increasingly evident. (7) In the Northern Area, the enemy forces are very quiet due to poor weather conditions on the northern front.</p>
<h3>Takachiho Unit - Surprise Attack on Enemy Flank - Japanese Aircraft Bomb Two Airfields on Leyte Island</h3>
<p>Philippine Frontline Base, 17th (Central News Agency) - On the 6th of this month, a portion of the Takachiho Unit, which carried out a surprise landing at the Burauen airfield on Leyte Island and other locations, has since the 7th, with powerful units under the command of Major Saitabe, continuously carried out drop operations in several locations around Ormoc on the west coast of Leyte Island, cooperating with ground troops to launch a surprise attack on the enemy forces landing at Albea and attacking Ormoc, attacking their flanks and backs, achieving great accomplishments in past battles.</p>
<p>Philippine Base, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese air force bombed the Tacloban and Dulag airfields on Leyte Island on the night of the 13th, shattering several locations at each airfield.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Burma - Expanding War Results</h3>
<p>Burmese Frontline, 17th (Central News Agency) - Japanese units encountered the main force of the 30th Division of the Chongqing Army (Yu Army) at Namani (28 kilometers northwest of Namgaum), which was moving south from the old Burma Road in Bhamo. Since the 9th, they have launched a fierce attack on the Chongqing Army defending the position, inflicting great damage and gradually pressing them northwest. From the 9th to the 13th, the losses suffered by the Chongqing Army included abandoning 500 bodies, personnel casualties reaching 1,500, and a large number of various artillery and ammunition captured. In addition, in order to destroy the encircled New 38th Division of the Chongqing Army in Bhamo, Japanese forces dispatched from Namgaum and Japanese forces moving north along the Bhamo-Monto Road also launched an attack on a portion of the New 32nd Division of the Chongqing Army attempting to move south near Xidao (50 kilometers south of Bhamo) on the 10th. The Chongqing Army suffered casualties of over 500, and the Japanese forces are currently fiercely attacking the Chongqing Army that is resisting. On the 10th of this month, the Japanese air force cooperated with naval units to launch a fierce attack on the Alensangwo Chongqing military stronghold. In this battle, it was confirmed that the Chongqing Army abandoned 96 bodies, and three artillery pieces and large vehicles were destroyed, and fires broke out in more than ten warehouses and barracks. At noon on the 11th, the Chongqing Army, carrying five or six cannons, launched another attack, but the Japanese forces immediately repelled them to the Alensangwo area. Furthermore, another unit of the Japanese army also launched a surprise attack on the Chongqing Army that was constructing defensive positions near Mendo, and the war results are gradually expanding.</p>

<h3>Leyte Gulf Naval Battle Continued Report</h3>
<p>— Shunzhi</p>
<p>Around noon on a certain day in mid-October, the anti-aircraft guns of the Japanese aircraft carrier 〇〇 suddenly opened fire. An enemy reconnaissance plane flew out of the high white clouds. After a fierce Japanese interception, it immediately fled back into the clouds, but the Japanese escort plane did not let up at all, tracking it like a shadow.</p>
<p>The enemy plane had already made contact with the Japanese fleet. That day, Commander Shiota issued an attack order to the entire army: "Believe in divine protection, the entire army assaults." This was a long-awaited order. All the soldiers were spirited, their blood boiling, everyone itching to destroy the enemy.</p>
<p>The Battle of Leyte Gulf</p>
<p>Nothing happened overnight, and the next day was the long-awaited day of attack for the entire army. That day, the sky above the battlefield was clear, but the waves were still very high. Before dawn, the Japanese naval forces broke through the waterway near the island and suddenly appeared inside Leyte Gulf, charging into the center of the enemy fleet. The enemy formation was thrown into chaos. Then, the Japanese forces' huge guns devoured over sixty enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other ships, and the battle results continued to expand. One unit charged into the transport fleet, another unit charged into the escort fleet, and enemy ships were destroyed one after another in the face of the Japanese's roaring guns.</p>
<p>The suicide close combat of the Japanese assault unit was successful. In indescribable joy, the morale of all the soldiers was further raised. However, the deceived enemy would definitely pour its air power to challenge the Japanese fleet, so the entire Japanese army was on strict alert, preparing for interception. As expected, at 〇 o'clock, the sound of the trumpet for anti-aircraft combat configuration blared. After the discovery of the enemy reconnaissance plane, after 〇10 minutes, a large formation of enemy planes came from the 30-degree direction on the left, and at the same time, four large groups were discovered in the 20-degree direction. The fleet then quickly dispersed, forming a tight anti-aircraft sailing sequence. The ships escorting the aircraft carrier moved out one after another. Suddenly, the main guns of the Japanese battleship opened fire. With a rumble, huge shells shot into the enemy formation, and the enemy planes were dispersed. At the same time, the high-angle guns also roared, and the machine guns also fired like a string of pearls. In an instant, only white smoke and flying enemy planes were seen in the sky. In the midst of accurate and fierce fire, enemy planes fell one after another, some like fallen leaves blown by the wind, others suddenly disintegrating in the air, scattering like burning pieces of paper.</p>
<p>At this moment, the enemy planes concentrated their attack on the Japanese aircraft carrier group. Amidst the rising and falling columns of water, the Japanese aircraft carrier calmly fought back. Several near misses also occurred on the sides of our escort ships, stirring up huge columns of water. In this smoke-filled environment, the gun barrels of the machine guns became extremely hot.</p>
<p>Suddenly, near the aircraft carrier, a torpedo dragging a white trail shot like an arrow. Our escort destroyer 〇〇 drove at full speed, rushing between the torpedo and the aircraft carrier. With a deafening sound, the torpedo, which was about to hit the aircraft carrier, slammed into the destroyer's hull. 〇〇 was immediately enveloped in red flames and thick black smoke, but its forward turret was still firing at the enemy planes. Then, with another loud bang, the entire ship was blown to pieces. Destroyer 〇〇 sacrificed itself to protect the aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>That day, the enemy planes' attacks were very persistent. Large formations filled the sky and attacked repeatedly, no less than five times until dusk. Our fleet fought bloody battles under the enemy planes' concentrated attacks of torpedoes and bombs, shooting down many enemy planes, but the aircraft carrier 〇〇 was also unfortunately hit and sank.</p>
<p>Night Attack Greatly Defeats Enemy Ships</p>
<p>As the setting sun sank westward, the enemy planes were finally repelled. The sky over the South China Sea was as red as blood, like a banner for this tragic naval and air battle. The Japanese fleet, divided into several formations, reassembled at this point. The aircraft carrier 〇〇, which had fought on the ocean, could no longer be seen in its majestic form. A tragic atmosphere enveloped the entire fleet. Suddenly, as if breaking this heavy atmosphere, flashing signal lights appeared on the flagship.</p>
<p>"The entire army will immediately launch a suicide night attack on the enemy fleet, and must destroy them!"</p>
<p>Ah, how admirable this indomitable fighting spirit is! Even though there were sacrifices in the fierce battle where flesh and blood continued to fly, the attack was not relaxed. This traditional spirit of killing every enemy encountered aroused the entire army to rise up and generate new fighting spirit.</p>
<p>At that time, the main Japanese force followed behind the forward destroyer squadron, forming a neat single column and speeding through the dark sea. In the sky, the stars twinkled, and shooting stars with long tails swept across the sky from time to time.</p>
<p>Late at night, in front of the Japanese fleet, the flashes of dark-night thunder suddenly appeared in the low-hanging clouds. Then, faint sounds of gunfire like distant thunder were heard. Flash after flash, it turned out that the Japanese fast destroyer squadron had engaged with the enemy vanguard ships. The magnificent close-quarters night attack battle, a tradition of the Japanese Navy, unfolded. However, after a few minutes, the sea returned to its original tranquility. This night attack battle at least sank one enemy cruiser and hit other enemy ships. Unfortunately, when the main force arrived at the battlefield, the enemy had already retreated hastily to the south, so they had to withdraw their troops and head north.</p>
<p>In this way, the naval battle off the coast of the Philippines, which will be forever immortalized in history, ended with the Japanese's victorious voice. As a result of this naval battle, the enemy's naval forces suffered heavy losses, which was a major turning point in the subsequent air, sea, and land operations in Leyte Gulf. (Sent from Tokyo)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-discussing Rice Policy</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday, we discussed rice policy and put forward several short-term and long-term solutions. We believe that if we strictly prohibit random price increases and speculative manipulation of rice prices, they can return to lower levels. This is the past experience. Of course, there are many reasons for this round of soaring rice prices, but manipulation by unscrupulous merchants and random price increases by vendors are the main causes. In particular, some rice merchants in county and suburban areas are manipulating the situation, leading to uncontrollable madness. Therefore, in our article "On Rice Policy," we advocated strict management of rice prices and absolutely not adopting a laissez-faire attitude.</p>
<p>How to manage it strictly? According to the current environment, we advocate implementing two things that are simple and easy to do first.</p>
<p>(1) Centralized retail transactions: Scatter vendors should be concentrated in one or several areas, and street vending should be prohibited to facilitate management. The selling price should be determined and approved by the authorities, and price increases should not be arbitrary. The determination of the fixed price should take into account costs and reasonable profits. For example, the current cost of buying rice by vendors in the production area is assumed to be 1,500 yuan per dou (unit of volume). Extortion along the way should be cracked down on, but for the sake of argument, even if this illegal fact exists, then the extortion along the way should be counted as 500 yuan per dou, so the cost per dou is 2,000 yuan. Giving a profit of 500 yuan per dou, the total will not exceed 2,500 yuan per dou. Assuming that this number is the fixed price, and after being approved by the relevant authorities, price increases should not be allowed unless the actual cost has increased.</p>
<p>(2) Joint purchase by districts: Joint purchasing offices should be set up near the areas where rice vendors enter, and nearby registered rice shops should be allowed to participate. For example, joint purchasing offices should be set up in Caojiadu, Xujiahui, Zhoujiaqiao, and other places. Personnel should be dispatched by relevant government agencies to supervise, stipulate reasonable prices, and purchase the rice entering from vendors. The quantity purchased daily should be reported to the Rice Management Committee and the municipal government's competent authorities, and then sold to citizens at a fair price. However, the maximum quantity should be stipulated for this fair-priced sale, and excessive purchases should not be allowed to prevent hoarding. At the same time, the wealthy should not be allowed to purchase, and it should be limited to salary earners, laborers, and ordinary people, and handled according to the occupation filled in on the citizen's certificate.</p>
<p>The above methods can be implemented simultaneously. Vendors are free to enter the centralized market or sell to joint purchasing offices. However, random price increases along the way are prohibited. These two methods still provide principles. If the government believes they are feasible, they should be carefully considered and specific measures should be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>This round of soaring rice prices is undoubtedly a planned action by unscrupulous merchants, which has led to general price increases. Some people say that the more price controls are implemented in this city, the more unstable prices become. In reality, it is the lack of unity in the powers of economic institutions and the lack of strictness in laws and regulations. The past laxity and chaos have nurtured the ambitions of unscrupulous merchants, who are unscrupulous and do whatever they want. If the most severe punishments are taken against those who manipulate prices, hoard goods, and public officials who commit fraud in their own name after the facts have been verified, the more serious ones should be executed and the less serious ones should be imprisoned and paraded through the streets to give unscrupulous people a relentless punishment, killing one to warn a hundred. Then the manipulators will naturally be wary, and prices can be stabilized. Conversely, if only fines are used to settle the matter and favoritism is shown, then these people's ambitions will be difficult to suppress, and prices will naturally be difficult to stabilize. In short, the current rice price is no longer an economic issue, it has exceeded the scope of economics, and it is a security issue. Therefore, it is only effective to use the laws of security to punish these unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Finally, we hope that the authorities of the Rice Management Committee will do their best to dredge the source of rice so that the rice allocated to households can be distributed on time. At the same time, we know that the advantage of the food allocation in allied Japan is that it is appropriate and average. It does not give too much to be too full, but it does not lead to starvation, which is entirely to adapt to wartime life. Manchuria and North China all eat coarse grains, so the general public should eat more coarse grains, reduce waste, and adapt to the environment.</p>
<h3>President Chen Delivers Radio Address to Japanese People Hoping Allied Nations Will Fully Assist in Completing the Great Task of Nation-Building</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, Mr. Chen, delivered a radio address to the entire Japanese nation at 7:20 PM on the 17th, stating that China is determined to carry forward the long-cherished wish of the people, the Three Principles of the People, and the late President Wang's legacy, and move forward bravely to complete the war for China's own liberation, hoping to give it assistance so that China can devote itself to the Great East Asia War and complete President Wang's legacy. The full text of his radio address is as follows:</p>
<p>Dear Japanese people, I am broadcasting to you again in Tokyo today, and I feel an unusually warm and close feeling. At the same time, I feel very honored. This is my third official visit to Tokyo since the National Government returned to its capital. The first time was in May of the 29th year of the Republic of China, after the National Government returned to its capital, when I came to your country to return the courtesy under the order of President Wang. The second time was in April of last year, after the National Government participated in the Great East Asia War, when I came to your country to visit under the order of President Wang. Now it is the third time, and since President Wang passed away on the 10th of last month, there is no longer his guidance. I have infinite sorrow and feel the importance of my own responsibility. I hope that the Japanese government and people will stand in the position of an allied nation and friendship and give China cooperation.</p>
<p>Recalling that President Wang crossed over to your country in early March of this year to recuperate, he received unusual care and preferential treatment from the Japanese government and people. All the people in our country are unusually grateful. We will never forget the warmth and high regard of your country. Today, on behalf of the Chinese people, I would like to express my infinite gratitude to you.</p>
<p>Inheriting the Legacy of Predecessors</p>
<p>President Wang has passed away, and we feel that we have lost the guidance of our leader, and at the same time, we feel even more that his legacy must be realized.</p>
<p>The great policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building left by Mr. Wang is the foundation for establishing permanent cooperation between China and Japan. His instructions this year on New Year's Day to rectify thoughts, increase production, and establish security are the guidelines for consolidating the rear of the Great East Asia War. In the future, we should be based on what he has proclaimed, and be determined to share weal and woe with your country, even to live and die together. We survivors must shoulder the responsibility and implement them one by one, so as not to fail President Wang's legacy, and to realize the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father.</p>
<p>There is something that must be solemnly told to you today. First, the Great East Asia War must be completed. This is the determination of the National Government. The National Government decided to participate in the war on December 8 of the Republic of China when Japan launched the Great East Asia War.</p>
<p>The conviction will never waver</p>
<p>This participation in the war was voluntary because China has long been subjected to the aggression of British and American imperialism. China's status as a semi-colony for a hundred years originated entirely from the Opium War. Therefore, opposing British and American imperialism is the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people. We strive for our own liberation and for the liberation of all the nations of East Asia who share the same fate. Our participation in the war is based on justice, humanity, and friendship. In the future, no matter how the war develops or how urgent the situation becomes, we will base our actions on the long-cherished wish of the people, the Three Principles of the People of the Founding Father Sun Yat-sen, and the legacy of President Wang, and we will move forward without hesitation, never wavering, never retreating.</p>
<p>Striving to promote peace</p>
<p>Second, China and Japan must cooperate to lay the foundation for Great East Asia. The purpose of the National Government's return to its capital is to show peace between China and Japan, and to work harder to promote comprehensive peace in China. Moreover, the purpose of returning to its capital that day was not satisfied with peace between China and Japan, but to further seek permanent cooperation between China and Japan. China does not spare its meager efforts and hopes to share the responsibility of East Asia. Although there are still some people in Chongqing who do not understand this purpose, the National Government must continue to work hard to make them understand, so as not to fail Mr. Wang's great wish of returning to Nanjing that day, and not to fail the greatest goal of the joint fighting power of the people of insight in China and Japan that day.</p>
<p>The two countries share weal and woe</p>
<p>There are too many things I want to tell you. Today, I will only choose the key points to state the interests, peace, and security of China and Japan. Today has reached a period where they cannot be separated. The ability of the world's humanity to enable the countries of East Asia to get rid of their colonial status, and the liberation of China and other East Asian nations, all depend on this war. China's strength is limited, and my ability is even more limited. I deeply hope that the government and people of your country will give assistance so that China can devote itself to the Great East Asia War, so that we can complete President Wang's legacy. This is especially something that can be hoped for and appreciated.</p>
<h3>The Greater East Asia Ministry in Japan Holds a Meeting of Envoys to China to Hear On-the-Ground Realities and Discuss Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - In order to hear on-the-ground realities and deliberate on current policies, the Greater East Asia Ministry took advantage of Ambassador Tani’s presence in Tokyo, and held a conference of ambassadors and ministers to China at the official residence of the Vice-Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry at 9:00 AM on the 16th. In addition to the ambassadors, the meeting was attended by consulate heads and ministers from various locations, including Kusunoki (Peiping), Tashiro (Canton), and Tsuchida (Shanghai), as well as Minister Chunhiko stationed in Manchukuo, military attachés Hara and Takeuchi from the Greater East Asia Ministry, and heads of relevant bureaus and sections. Various frank discussions were held, and the meeting adjourned around 4:00 PM in the afternoon. It is reported that past conferences of ambassadors and ministers to China were held locally, but this is the first time it has been held in Tokyo, hence its outcome is highly anticipated.</p>
<h3>President Chen Speaks to Reporters in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - Chen Gongbo, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, met with reporters at the State Guest House here at 11:00 AM on the 16th and made the following remarks: Before expressing my personal opinions, I would like to convey the sincere congratulations of the Chinese government and people to your esteemed country.</p>
<p>Expressing Gratitude to Allied Nations</p>
<p>Firstly, since Mr. Wang Jingwei came to your country for medical treatment in March of this year, he has received gracious treatment from His Majesty the Emperor, warm hospitality from the ministers, dedicated care from the doctors and nurses, and special concern from the people. This represents an unprecedented display of amity in the diplomatic history of China and Japan, which has deeply moved the Chinese government and people. This is the first point for which we should express our gratitude to your country. Secondly, since China joined the Greater East Asia War last January, your esteemed country voluntarily returned the concessions in March of the same year, declared the abolition of extraterritorial rights, assisted our country in recovering the concessions in China held by various countries, including the public concessions, and abolished the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol, enabling China to achieve complete independence and freedom. This has allowed the realization of both the last words of the founding father, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, regarding the abolition of unequal treaties and Pan-Asianism, and the spirit and effect of Chairman Wang’s cooperation with your country over the years, which have become clear to the world. Your country's justice to the world and friendship to China have been fully revealed. This not only liberates China but also the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. This is the second point for which we should express our gratitude to your country.</p>
<p>Cooperating in the War of Liberation</p>
<p>As for what I wish to declare to you gentlemen today, we feel infinite sorrow at the passing of Mr. Wang Jingwei. At the same time, we will transform our sorrow into courage and determination to complete Chairman Wang's legacy. We will certainly cooperate more closely with your country to complete the Greater East Asia War. The process of China becoming a semi-colony of the great powers began a century ago with the Opium War. Therefore, opposing Anglo-American imperialism is the great aspiration of the 450 million people of China. Although the Xinhai Revolution did not explicitly oppose Anglo-American imperialism, it was caused by Anglo-American imperialist aggression, and the people rose up, first seeking to reform domestic politics, and then urgently seeking self-preservation and national salvation. The Kuomintang was reorganized in 1924, further sweeping away previous vague concepts and clearly marking the opposition to Anglo-American imperialism, in order to seek freedom and equality for China. Therefore, the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War purely represents the aspirations of the people of the entire country and implements the party program of the Kuomintang. The National Government never considered success or failure, profit or loss at the outset. In the future, even if the war situation changes again, or the situation becomes even more pressing, we firmly believe that the National Government will not waver because of this. Your country's leadership in the Greater East Asia War is fighting for justice and for the liberation of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. Our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War is also fighting for justice and, more importantly, for our own liberation. Wherever justice lies, there will be no hesitation. Although there are many difficulties, we will not change our original intention.</p>
<p>Economic Foundation Still Unsound</p>
<p>Furthermore, the foundation of the Chinese economy is currently not sound. During this visit to your country, I plan to have candid discussions with your country on various issues. Especially important is the review of economic issues. I sincerely hope that both countries will cooperate to resolve issues such as the adjustment of military and civilian needs, the increase in production, financial problems, and the suppression of commodity prices, so as to maximize the effects of the total war effort. Today, China and Japan share the same interests, and our safety and danger are intertwined. The relationship between the two countries is truly inseparable. Stabilizing China is stabilizing East Asia, which is also stabilizing the great rear of the Greater East Asia War. I hope that you will all pay attention to this and fully cooperate with the National Government. During this trip to the East, my faith in the Japanese people's belief in the ultimate victory of the Greater East Asia War has grown stronger, which makes us feel infinitely excited. We can only, based on Chairman Wang's determination to share weal and woe with Japan, even to the point of sharing life and death, courageously move forward, to comfort Chairman Wang's spirit in heaven and to comfort the people's long-cherished desire for China's freedom and independence.</p>
<h3>Minister Lin Answers Questions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - After Chen Gongbo, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, arrived in Japan, he met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 16th and made a statement. At the same time, Minister of Propaganda Lin Bosheng answered questions from the reporter group regarding President Chen's statement, saying that the purpose of the Japanese army's current operation on the mainland is to destroy the Anglo-American forces of aggression in China. Not only is this deeply understood in the peaceful areas, but the people in the resistance areas in Chongqing are also gradually understanding it. The overall peace and unification of China may be rapidly promoted. Furthermore, the people of the entire China are comparing Japan's new policy towards China with the Anglo-American policy of aggression, and their trust in Japan has increased.</p>
<h3>Former President of the Privy Council, Count Ichiki, Passes Away</h3>

<h3>Suppressing High Rice Prices: Effective Measures Being Planned to Simultaneously Address Symptoms and Root Causes to Curb Price Hikes</h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial and industrial market conditions experienced dramatic changes in the past week. The magnitude of the turmoil was unprecedented this year. The public unease has reached an extreme point, especially with the soaring black market prices of rice. The situation has become chaotic. The biggest reason for this is the speculative merchants deliberately spreading groundless rumors, taking the opportunity to manipulate and hoard goods, raising market prices in an attempt to make exorbitant profits. However, the economic authorities failed to thoroughly balance and regulate the daily necessities of the people's livelihoods, causing food panic to intensify, affecting the prices of other goods to rise one after another. In the financial sector, the price of gold continued to rise every day of the past week, with each surge reaching tens of thousands of yuan. The market prices in the morning and afternoon fluctuated greatly. Silver rose by more than 30%. Chinese stocks remained firm and continued to rise. The bulls were reluctant to sell, and retail investors continued to absorb them. The overnight interest rate remained at 50%, but interbank lending rates were 15% per month, and it was still not easy to obtain funds. Those who had funds did not lend them out but instead purchased goods, which directly stimulated higher prices. In the industrial and commercial sectors, factories in various industries have not been able to resume operations after the power outage. Therefore, the future of production is particularly worrying. At the same time, rice prices continue to soar, and people's livelihoods are in imminent danger. Various industrial and commercial firms are hoarding goods related to people's livelihoods, taking advantage of the situation to arbitrarily raise prices, and even hoarding them without selling. The market prices of rice, coal, oil, sugar, firewood, miscellaneous grains, cotton textiles, daily necessities, and other commodities related to people's livelihoods are all rising sharply. It is heard that the relevant authorities and various industry control groups in the city are urgently discussing fundamental and symptomatic solutions to the problems of rice regulation, supply and demand, price suppression, and supplementary distribution of household rice. A solution may be resolved shortly and put into practice. It is expected that the black market price of rice will plummet in the near future. We hope that citizens will not panic each other. At the same time, we also hope that the economic authorities will quickly seek practical and effective measures to eliminate speculators, so that there is hope of suppressing commodity prices.</p>
<h3>Economic Bureau Promotes Agricultural Production Experimentation Work to Investigate Actual Conditions in Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Sixth Section of the Municipal Economic Bureau believes that the promotion of high-quality varieties and the use of fertilizers in the increase of production in various counties is not yet perfect. At the time when the central government is promoting it, it has specially cooperated with the Municipal Agricultural Production Promotion Committee to issue a notice to the counties under its jurisdiction, ordering them to immediately investigate and report on the rice varieties and winter cultivation promotion situation in the rural areas of the counties, as well as the types of fertilizers used, in order to check the actual situation according to the climate and soil conditions of each place, and then request the Ministry of Industry to distribute various varieties to the counties for implementation.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Weights and Measures Randomly Checks Weighing Instruments</h3>
<p>In order to effectively promote legal weights and measures, prevent the use of inaccurate weighing instruments, directly disrupt the perfect system of measurement, and indirectly exploit the common people, obtaining illegal profits, the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures has specially dispatched a large number of personnel to implement a random inspection system on the weights and measures used in various stores throughout the city, in order to unify the weights and measures in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Organizational Structure to be Readjusted</h3>
<p>The authorities are currently devising a plan to readjust the organizational structure of the city's major commodity trade associations in the near future. The rectification measures will begin once formally approved by the Ministry of Industry. Previously, the relevant authorities repeatedly ordered the reorganization of the organizational structure of the city's major and secondary commodity trade associations, merging those with similar characteristics, resulting in numerous disputes. Generally, these trade associations were formed due to past habits, and once merged, both parties often felt inconvenience. Some individually requested independent organizations, but were not approved due to legal regulations. In view of this and in response to the actual needs, the competent authorities have proposed a re-evaluation and rectification.</p>
<h3>Bakers Request Improvement of Flour Quality</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Goods Distribution Office has repeatedly received a joint petition from Oriental Bakery Manufacturers and others, stating that the quality of the flour recently distributed is poor, and the bread produced is hard and rough, making it difficult for purchasers to chew and difficult to sell, which greatly affects business. Samples were attached, requesting that the Flour and Bran Distribution Office be instructed to improve the quality. After receiving the petition, the office found that the above-mentioned matters were true and immediately ordered the Flour and Bran Distribution Office to improve the quality in the future.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Markets in Nanshi Restrict Business Hours to Maintain Street Cleanliness</h3>
<p>Recently, the Nanshi Health Office of the Municipal Health Bureau found that the vegetable markets in the Nanshi district sell vegetables from morning to night without a fixed time, making it difficult to clean the roads. This not only affects the city's appearance but also hinders public health. Therefore, it is stipulated that the vendors in these vegetable markets are limited to selling any vegetables before 12:00 PM every day. It is not allowed to exceed this time, so that the streets can be cleaned. A letter was also sent to the three police stations in Nanshi, asking them to cooperate in order to rectify the situation.</p>

<h3>Please Urge the Monks and Taoists in the City to Devote Themselves to Social Welfare Undertakings</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yuying</p>
<p>In 1933, the government promulgated the Implementation Measures for Temples and Monasteries to Run Public Welfare and Charitable Undertakings, stipulating that temples and monasteries throughout the country should allocate a percentage of their property income to run public welfare and charitable undertakings, which is sufficient to promote the spirit of religion and can also assist the government in promoting social policies. The intention is very good. However, since the promulgation and implementation of this measure, although many temples and monasteries in various places have complied with it, most of them have only superficially complied with it, and there are few that are of a considerable scale or have achieved results. Buddhism takes the greater self as the foundation and convenience as the door. Taoism is pure and inactive, saving oneself and saving others. Monks and Taoists should work hard, strengthen their aspirations, have the intention of universal salvation, and perform social service, and it is definitely not enough to simply chant scriptures and pray all day long. On the other hand, Christianity aims at universal love. Its pastors and believers are generally able to devote themselves to social undertakings. The schools, hospitals, and refugee areas established during wartime are all sufficient to express the spirit of Christ. Furthermore, the nuns of Catholicism, in addition to devoting themselves to self-cultivation, also run orphanages, nurseries, and nursing homes, working day and night without懈怠, and their reputation is well-known. In order to comply with the law and promote religion, in the future, monks and Taoists in various places must abandon their prejudices, eliminate old habits, and automatically work hard in social welfare undertakings, so as to save themselves in the future. The city's temples, monks, and property are the richest in the country. If they can catch up quickly and devote themselves to social welfare undertakings, then one call will bring a hundred responses, and various places will be able to emulate each other, and the effectiveness of this will be unimaginable, and Buddhism and Taoism will surely be able to rely on this to become brighter day by day.</p>
<p>There are many types of social welfare undertakings, and the scope is also wide. If they are not carried out properly, the effort will be doubled with half the results, or even abandoned halfway. If the temples and monasteries in this city are to run social welfare undertakings, they should first pay attention to social needs and start with active undertakings. They should also prepare detailed plans and submit them to the government for registration. For each undertaking, at least 80% of the funds must be raised by themselves. In terms of personnel, it is best for the monks and Taoists of the temple to share the work themselves, and there is no need to hire others. If the temple's manpower and financial resources are insufficient, it may be possible to jointly manage it with nearby temples and monasteries, so that it can be sustained. Here are some of the social welfare undertakings that the temples and monasteries in this city can run:</p>
<p>(1) People's Canteens - The temples and monasteries in this city have many monks, ranging from hundreds to dozens. Their original kitchens, canteens, and food utensils must be available. It will be easy to run people's canteens using the original utensils. If it conflicts with the temple's dining, the three meals can be moved earlier, which will not be an obstacle. These people's canteens can advocate vegetarian food, in line with the Buddhist spirit of protecting all living beings. As for rice, even if it is sought from the black market, it is acceptable, as long as the price is low, the food is hygienic, and it is beneficial to health.</p>
<p>(2) Small Loans - Most of the temples and monasteries in this city have abundant income. If they can take out some funds and assign personnel to be responsible for handling small loans, the procedures will not be troublesome. These loans are limited in amount and carried out in stages. Interest can also be charged appropriately. It is best to adopt a credit system, and the funds that can be returned can still be used for lending, so that the people and small vendors can benefit greatly.</p>
<p>(3) Job Placement - Many of the patrons of the temples and monasteries are wealthy and have higher status. If the abbots of the temples can use the opportunity to recommend and introduce job opportunities to some unemployed people who are indeed capable, it will be easy and successful. Therefore, it may be possible to first register job seekers and then introduce them, matching talents to jobs, and the patrons will be happy to accept them.</p>
<p>(4) Homes for Reformed Women - Due to the special circumstances in this city, many fallen women have been unable to extricate themselves. If the nunneries and Taoist nunneries in this city can allocate housing to run homes for reformed women, it will surely be able to save many pitiful women and children. The homes will be run by the female abbots, who will provide production training to enable them to support themselves, so that they do not have to rely on the relief of others.</p>
<p>In addition, temporary relief efforts such as tea distribution in summer and porridge distribution in winter can also be carried out as appropriate. In short, the temples and monasteries in this city can use their surplus manpower, material resources, financial resources, and time to run various social welfare undertakings. If they can be carried out diligently and persistently, the results will be significant, and the religion can be promoted and developed as a result. The government and society will have infinite expectations.</p>
