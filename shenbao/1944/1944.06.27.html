<h3>社評　把握時機</h3>
<p>關於農業增產，尤其是糧食增產問題，我們已經數次提出，以供當局參考，以促社會注意。在此糧食問題極度嚴重的今日，治本的增產方法，實為不可或緩的急要之圖。盟邦日水對於戰時增加生產，無論在工業與農業方面，莫不精益求精，不斷檢討，以求進步。然而，盟邦在工農業生產上的條件，如設備，如技術，如原料，如運輸等等，無一不較我國為强，都為我國所望塵莫及，可是，他們依然不會自滿，隨時作適應環境的改革進步，發揮最高度的效率。反觀我國各方面情形散漫，雖有增產計劃，而實施成效如何，尚成問題。我們對於盟邦日本始終不懈的精神，更覺佩愧交併。</p>
<p>本報今天選譯盟邦日本推進食糧增產的文字兩篇，雖然具體方法與我們的現狀各異，未能全部採取，可是，熱烈增產以及適應環境的精神，頗足提供我們取法，迎頭趕上·尤其譯評中說：「以前為了擴充工塲生產的目的，在吸收工員上無暇他顧。今因調整軍需及民需工塲的生產，及改善工塲的勞務管理，認為從工員中將冗員移向農村，有此可能性。此可視為基於嚴重的戰局之要求而反省的結果，誠為劃時期的方策。」更可說明日本是在如何虛心檢討事實，而反省覓取更能適應要求的合理方策。特別值得我們所警惕而倣效的。</p>
<p>近來本市米價，由於來源的不絕，已趨稍回之勢。如果整個統制機構改善，通盤計劃能够在各地普遍實施，相信米價之回復正常，是極可能的事。惜乎技枝節節，縱有臨時應急措置，成效極微。總而言之，糧食問題是永久性的問題，根本辦法，還在增加生產，希望主管當局隨時注意研究增產方案，切實執行，務使逐漸獲得效果。目前本市會糧問題，我們仍然主張加緊疏通來源，對於運輸及沿途關口，必須充分給予便利。頃據靑浦來人談稱，靑浦縣政府本有禁止米糧出口之令，程本市要求開禁三天，於是負販者自晨至暮絡繹於送，肩踵相接，不論少壯老幼婦嫗之輩，莫不出動為臨時米販。從此可以看出，第二，產地米糧並非絕對無餘。第二，產地之米並非無人販運。而問題在於有無通盤計劃與沿途通行，如果政府有通盤計劃，能實施於全部產米地區，使販運者能有利潤，而沿途販運無勒素留難，則來源可以疏通不絕，不致恐慌了。</p>
<p>目前距離新榖登塲尚有兩月，兩月以後的來源，自可增加數量。根據去年所得的經騐，在此兩個月中，我們希望當局從速籌擬改革米糧統制機構及調整人事問題，過去種種窒礙悉予　除，合情合理，疏通來源。光陰荏苒，兩個月轉瞬卽屆，把握時機，幸勿交臂失之。</p>
<h3>譯評　推食糧增產之一助</h3>
<p>食糧的增產是安定國民生活的基礎，與軍需增產猶如層齒之相榑並進，以鞏固進向戰勝的道路。負責當局農商省方面，前曾設置有關戰時食糧增產之中央推進本部，決定請求各方面協力的方針，十二，十四兩日，以米麥增產問題為中心，作種種討論。米麥等主要食糧及一般農產　種品的增產上之必要方法，不待說，非片言可盡·這裏所想說的，除稻的下種，麥的收割外，擬就農忙期前今日的農村中，勞力缺乏的補充及利用，略述所見如次：</p>
<p>本來，我國農業的特徵之一，是在狹小的土地上，有許多家族性的小規模經營。但在戰時下的今日，嚴地的面積，農業勞力的數量，均大為减少，這是無可避免的。當局業於本年二月，設定職時農業要員制度，從事農工勞力的調繫與農村勞力的確保·現在不使農村的勞力保持原狀，並亦着手計劃學生及非農家的　勞動員，與女子勞力的訓練等，即在於彌補此項缺憾。然至最近，農商當局更鑒於對農村勤勞動員的必要，乃對於工員的農村動員，亦特別加以考慮。</p>
<p>是以不僅强化農業及農村關係的學生及兒童之農業動員，必要時，並擬將現正就業於工塲之學生，及預定即將動員於工塲中的學生，動員到農村去，甚至於就業中的工塲勞務者，亦計劃動員到農村，這些確是值得注目的事實。以前為了擴充工塲生產的目的，在吸收工員上，無睱他顧。今因調整軍需及民需工塲的生產，及改善工塲的勞務管理，認為從工員中將冗員移向農村，有此可能性。此可視為基於嚴重的戰同之要求而反省之結果，誠為劃時期的方策。這裏的問題，是使這些工員出動於何時何地？這大約將視各工塲及農村之實情，而臨機應付。最能够發揮食糧增產能率的方法，不待說，應使工員及學生復歸於農村。這裏，在運輸及其他種種情形上，或許有不少困難，但鑒於先前軍隊曾實施農繁期的歸休制度之先例，這未必是不可能的。從事工塲勞動的父兄及子弟，得重　逼　的家庭，此對於農家及鄉村在精神上生產上，又將是怎樣的幸福？農村與工塲，因此而得以融和，其利正未可知。</p>
<p>這樣，我國固有的家族的農業生產之特衛，將愈能發揮且這家族的生產之神，必須立即擴大到隣保及國家的昂揭生產之精神。隣保精神的活用，沒有再像今日的農業生產追樣迫切了。無論到那一村落，老弱婦孺，均從事勞動，靑年壯年男子，則被召至戰塲及工塲。是縱有極少的健康男子殘留着，為了本身，為了隣舍，為了友人的看家者，並為了部落的全體，不能不負担二震三重的勞役。</p>
<p>加以種茁，肥料，除虫劑，農具等，都由隣保制度配給，而米殼的獻納及報獎制度，根本亦以部落為單位的隣保負共同連帶責任。且耕地的整理，暗溫排水，亦非各農家各自為政者。在軍事救護，託兒等事業上實行的隣保共助精神，自也應該充分移用於役　，農機具的使用，及農業勞役的運營上。縱使全部都是老弱婦孺，並有少數男子，為了使他們相倚相助，向增產之途萬進，實有賴於我國固有隣保精神，而推進食糧增產，此亦為一大助力。（翔；譯自六月十四日朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>日機隊反復猛炸　塞班島書夜激戰　襲大宮島敵機墜毀百餘架</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　塞班島方面，日機隊篇協力陸上戰鬥，曾連夜出動，反復夜襲敵軍，二十五日曾盆炸該島之加拉邦方面彩帆神廟甫方及羅洛方面丘陵地帶之敵陣，阿斯利特機塲附近之敵陣暨敵軍需品儲藏所，舟艇羣等。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　塞班島之陸上戰門，運日來甚為激列，二十四日之戰況如次：敵軍對塞班島之攻擊，白書固勿待論即于夜間亦使其大批艦艇游擊于該島附近海面，以探照火與照明彈之光，連作猛烈炮擊，于彈雨下並以戰軍逐次北上，當地日軍即行邀擊，缊續與敵血戰，至二十四日夜，日軍仍保持加拉邦市之大　信該島最高　塔保喬山（海拔四十四米）之　綫，更時而出擊或造挻身除潛入敵陣，發砲射擊之阻止敵軍使用阿斯利特機　，殘　敵軍砲兵陣地，總之，日軍雖于困難情形下，但其士氣仍極旺盛，現仍奮戰中。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據珍珠　電，尼米資司令部二十六日發表，日軍機會　　塞班島美軍陣地，頗有所傷。</p>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電　里利亞納羅島方面戰局，自六月十日敵軍機動部隊出現該地區以來，激烈已極，敵機空要大宮島，自十一日迄達一百五十架之多</p>
<h3>日軍中央部隊　攻入衡陽機塲　進擊我渝美空軍基地</h3>
<p>湖南日軍某基地二十六日中央社急電　日華中作戰軍中央部隊，現正沿粵漢綫繼續進攻，已於二十四日拂曉，攻入粵漢綫要衛，及駐渝美空軍前進據點衡陽機塲之一角，當即擊潰守備機塲之渝第十軍約二師人之頑抗，刻正擴大戰果中。按此次作戰中，攻入駐渝美空軍基地成功，尚為初次。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　路透社重慶訪員，二十五日說明日軍進擊湖南要衝衛陽情形稱，據前綫報吿，日軍先頭部隊，已迫近衛陽東方五公里之地點，沿粵漢綫南下之日軍，亦已抵衡陽東北九公里半，及東方十六公里之地點。此外從粵漢路東側南下之日軍，亦渡過來水，目下轉向西方，已至距離衛陽約五公里半之地點云。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局二十五日發表，湖南戰况如次：衡陽防衛綫已展開激戰，日軍於開抵雷溪市後，即於二十四日正午渡過沬水，（湘江支流）進攻衡陽東北約十公里，及東方十七公里之各地點·此外另一路日軍，渡過挂水進攻，向西挺進，並對衛陽西方約六公里之地區戰鬥，目下正在整個地域進展中。日軍另一部隊，已於二十四日晨突入萍鄉。</p>
<p>日軍佔領要衝攸縣湖面前綫日軍某基地二十六日中央社電　日軍快速部隊沿萬洋山南下，二十二日攻陷萍鄉，更乘勢猛進，二十五日佔領渝軍防衛衡陽重要防衛點攸縣，蓋日軍突破英洋山脈後，即南進自第三戰區擊滅渝軍第二十六軍，一舉佔領萍鄉附近一帶。又另一部隊亦予以呼應，擊滅醴陵附近之渝二十軍三十七軍四十四軍之殘軍，覆目株州方面敗退之渝　編第二軍，而完成攻略攸縣。</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日中央社電　據路透社重要訪員訊，湖南戰局如次：衡陽乃湖南要衝，自古即爲軍家所爭之地。自中日事變以來，更成為華中華南之最重要產業商業及交通之中心，因其位於粵漢湘桂兩鐵路之交叉點，是故又為華南與四川省之交通中心地。職是倘衡陽一且陷於日軍之手，則渝美空軍不止失一主要基地，即中國西與東部之陸路聯絡，亦將墜入窘境。又日軍倘或確保衡陽，進而為佔領粵漢路全綫，勢更可向西南進攻桂林，向東南進攻廣東，果如此，則情勢愈益重大。裝備惡劣之渝軍，因不能阻止日軍機甲部隊沿鐵路或公路之進展，預料渝軍司令部或圖於日軍交通伸張至飽和程度，或日軍突入湖南山岳地帶之後，將試行反攻云。</p>
<p>漢日海軍發表戰果　漢口二十六日中央社電漢口日海軍報道部，六月二十六日下午三時發表，在長沙航路作戰之日海軍部隊，六月二十六日，完全佔領岳州長沙間九海里之水路。其作戰之戰果如左：擊落敵機三架，掃除機雷（六一二）個，破壞防塞九處，渝軍陣亡（五九）人。</p>
<h3>中樞舉行週會</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電國府二十六日舉行週會，文官參軍兩處職員全體參加，陳印鑄局長宗虞主席，行禮如儀，由陳局長報吿。</p>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電中央黨部二十六日晨十時，在該黨部大禮堂舉行第二〇七次　理紀念週，由徐委員蘇中　席。行禮如儀後，並報吿「戰事現階段之推測，」至十八時許禮成散會。</p>
<h3>京市米價穩定</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電本市米糧曾一度每石售五千元，旋當局准許米商自由買賣，公佈京市市民食米臨時措置實施辦法，一面由官方對米商採辦及運輸出全力協助，米統會允許向產區每月採辦三萬石運京調殘，一週來米價尚稱穩定，上等米每石四千二三百元。</p>
<h3>將校團官佐　電主席致敬</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　中央陸軍將校訓練團，高等軍學研究班第二期及幹部總隊第八期學員，經嚴格訓練，均有良好成績，今（二十七）日舉行聯合畢業式。茲悉該團兼敎育長簫叔宜氏，以汪兼團長刻在日本盟邦養疴，今謹率全體官佐學員　電致敬，其電文如後：東京中華民國駐日大使館轉呈團長汪鈞鑒，本團高研班第二期暨幹部總隊第八期學員二八一名，於本日舉行畢業典禮。際茲鈞長出國就醫，職等更應格外努力訓育，不敢稍懈，用副區望。學員等素蒙感召，亦知勤修苦幹，月前　暑演習，歷地蘇常，尚能嚴守軍紀。此次畢業成績，亦較前各期為優，堪紓茲念。近知鈞體康復，蒼生有賴，全團因益感奮，學員等回防後，自當盡本所　，改良部隊，感培植之恩德，　獻身以報國，肅電致敬，不　依　。中央陸軍將校訓練團兼敎育長蕭叔宣，率全體官佐學員叩，感。</p>
<h3>建部決心　整頓路警</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　建部對路警之整頓不遺餘力，惟以往各路警腐敗過甚，積習難改，故一時所收效力甚微。以往能檢查旅客及其行李，僅負維持車站秩序責任。關於此點，望各界週知。總實施整頓，期路警能弊絕風灣，切實負起愛路護民之責任。為實踐與亞翼贊運動，溝通中日思想文化，曾設立東洋文化研究所，著手敦聘各界　威者，茲該所正式改名東亞世界觀研究所，不獨研究抽象之學理，進而立足於思想，即運動作知行合一之研究，以興華北與亞　成所齊驅並　，為與亞　贊會重要附屬機關之一。並與中國方面保持一切關係，實施研究調查，設立講座，發行刋物，巡廻指導，並隨時召開講演會　談會，為金後中日思想未來世界觀之確立開一新紀元，其前途實頗堪期待。</p>
<h3>大東亞戰後　政治組織　日川原教授發表言論</h3>
<p>東京二十六日中央社電此間中央大學敎授州原次吉氏主張，大東亞戰後之政治組織，應以「家的秩序」為基礎，進行一切新建設，其言如次：無論任何國家，絕無不希望其祖國之維持與發展者，而與秩序下存在之國家，簡而言之，非對立的即利己主義者激成，此種相互對立與利已主義，以夢想確保制覇世界，而取得此中之利者，即現今英。美世界政策之根本理念，亦即此次大戰爆發之最大原因。國家孤立或對立，絕無生存之理，在經濟上能自給自足之國家，實不多見，因此始有世界經濟觀念之發生，舊世界經濟秩序，以為有金錢即可滿足一切慾望，故以政治影響所及，常有對此種秩序破壞之危險，世界經濟非以世界政洽為背景無實現可能。國際聯盟曾為世界政治機構之一種，但以英法將此種政體變為保障目己之工具，故而崩潰，同時，世界經濟亦無實現可能。迄今同一命運之數國家相互協力，以謀國個冢生存者，除「有無相通」。「共存共榮」之外·別無他途。廣域經濟圈。共榮圈建設等理想因之而生，實為歷史的必然性，而廣域經濟圈如不拋棄舊秩序原理所造成之個人主義，分立主義，永無實現可能。「家的秩序」原理可這用於團　間，大廣域經濟圈得以形成，　以個人主義者間之結合，乃基於互相利用，反之、家之結合，完全以道義為出發點，實為全體與少數共存之路。個人主義甚至主張捨棄家庭，如大子脫離家庭之諾美思想，已代表近代歐洲之根木思想，但在東亞則以較與夫皆為家庭之一部觀之，為組成全體不可缺乏細胞，離開全體即不得生存，始為家庭之根本理想，將來世界之新秩序，非依此原理為基礎，則不得防止戰爭再發生。日本目下即以此種理想，欲完成大東亞之新秩序建設，日本國家即寓於家族的國家秩序之上者，將此種秩序擴大於全東亞，進而現於全世界。於機械支配之下，乃為英美戰後經營論，換言之，亦可謂具有警察國家論的政治理念，以破壤秧序為遂口，為所欲為，如持此種理念，則絕不得根絕數禍。</p>

<p>仰光二十六日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府主席江特拉鮑斯，二十五日特就反軸心軍開始西歐登陸作戰時，發表聲明如次：英美宣傳之歐洲侵略作戰，終巳開始矣，此種舉動，對於軸軍陣營不僅毫無動搖，對於美英蘇三國間反而釀成幾多怨言。以德國方面言，德軍此次作戰開始前，屢向英美挑戰，希望早日展開最後之決戰，同時，英美兩國民亦曾要求展開第二戰綫，蘇軍亦曾責問英美有無誠意展開第二戰綫，而英美則以種種口實延長期限，歷二年之久，結果所展開之登陸作戰，又不能歸功於自己。蘇聯於開始登陸作戰之初，業已知悉英美之用意，如一戰爭與勞動階級雜誌」等蘇聯機關報，曾非難英美之作為不當，更不承認此次之侵歐作戰為眞正之第二戰錢。英美為履行與莫斯科政府之協約，乃不得不與德國周旋，迨作戰開展，英國支配地球之野望及美國制礪世界之迷夢，乃遭逢被粉碎之危機。法蘭西海岸激戰之結果，反軸心業巳喪失大量人力。物力·資源，及德軍之無人飛機示威於倫敦及南英格蘭後，英國各地頓感恐慌，而倫敦地區之被炸，至今仍日夜不息，因此倫敦，華盛頓之軍閥當必悔恨不該展開自殺行為之登陸作戰，實則英美兩國之空氣極為悲觀，反之，德國之熊度，悠然如常，且以自信與英美展開決戰，余曾長期逗留德國，以參觀戰時之德國，故德國內部之實力，為余所深知者，故余確信德軍必能澈底殲滅登陸之英美軍，美軍勢力分置於亞歐兩洲，故愛好自由之印人，無不歡迎此種事實，蓋德軍對英美勢力展開擊滅戰，此對於印度國民軍之獨立鬥戰，最為有利。</p>
<h3>北法坦克車大戰　蒂萊市淪為廢墟　奧納河口發現敵方大艦隊</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社引德官方戰報稱：敵於日昨竟日以强力之步兵及坦克車隊，攻於蒂萊Tilly地區，終將該市之廢墟佔領，但敵軍傷亡極為慘重。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社戰地記者韋勃稱：克恩以西二十公里處之　萊，昨晨起即有激戰，該處乃反軸心軍橋頭堡之右翼，深不過二十公里，現英軍進攻之中心廣約六公里，其兵力約四師國，又包括坦克車二師，是晨於砲轟約五小時半後，至七時左右即開始攻擊，激戰現在進行中，迄至目前為止，央軍僅在一點突入約一千公尺之深，敵海空軍協助作戰，德機及砲隊亦不甘落後，料今後數日內蒂萊之　戰事，或將擴大至克恩亦未可知，英軍主要目標顯係波加傑－克恩公路及克恩南之奧納錢。</p>
<p>瑞典廿六日中央社電　據海通社訊，路透業今日得官方息：英軍己佔領蒂萊，進攻軍且已進抵該城一千碼外。</p>
<p>柏林廿六日巾央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期大西歐前綫之主耍事件，為美軍對瑟堡要塞之大規模進攻，其他地區亦有値得注意之消息。奧納河口東岸與狄夫河（該河流入奧納河以東之塞納灣）間之德軍陣地，整日處於英美海軍重砲火下，由此可見反軸心軍現正計劃不久在該區發動大規模作戰，更進一步擴展其奧納河東岸之橋頭堡。而德方更預料反軸心軍最高當局將再度圖佔克恩城，而由該處向東推進，藉以擴大橋頭堡之深度，此舉反軸心軍將出動更多部隊，目下尙無充分之地盤足供使用，敵軍此等意向，頃己更趨明顯。敵軍於屋期日在蒂萊區之廣闊戰綫上，發動大進攻，足為其表徵，據早期報吿，英軍在蒂萊區之多次進攻，雖得暫時在德軍前方陣地突破若干缺口，終被擊退。</p>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　英人結集其大量之供應船團及登陸艦艇，其數約共三百五十艘，共二十七萬　噸，且以大量戰艦保護海軍砲之轟擊及空中之猛襲，企圖壓制奧納河東面之德軍海岸大炮，但德軍防禦砲火仍在里代貝爾拉海外擊沉登陸船二艘</p>
<h3>爭奪瑟堡最後一戰</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：爭奪瑟堡之最後一戰，發生於昨晚八時，其時德守軍殘部電德軍最高當局云，「爭奪瑟堡之最後一戰，頃已開始，司令官刻正與部下共同作戰，元首萬歲，大德意志萬歲！」瑟堡偉大之爭裏戰至是已吿結束，而該港已入反軸心軍之手矣。敵方動用十倍於德軍之兵力及戰具，以期於日昨佔領該市，德官方發表該末次爭奪戰之戰况如下：美坦克軍隊及步兵由南方及東方侵入瑟堡市區後，殘餘德軍之軍火僅能支持數小時，敵機不斷襲廢墟中之德軍防禦工事，而敵之俯動機亦加入作戰，與其陸上部隊呼應，敵戰鬥機則阻止德空軍增援德守軍，敵艦則以重砲轟炸，使德守軍前後均被擊，但德軍仍步步為營予敵以重創，敵坦克車多輛觸地雷而自毀。敵於晚間近六時抵達兵工廠地區，戰事至是特別激烈，敵欲出奇襲德軍未果，終以重砲於短距離地區轟炸德軍而佔領該地區。柯坦汀半島東北部之德守軍，刻仍與敵作戰，瑟堡－伐郞公路上之魯爾堡壘於昨晚擊退美軍一切之攻擊，預料瑟堡外圍戰事仍將繼續。</p>
<h3>德戰史上光榮一頁</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　美軍一部二十五日午後突人瑟堡巿街一角，德軍沿海岸砲台依然繼續抵抗，二十五日下午二時二十六分買反軸心軍艦歐四十生的大砲射擊，擊沉敵巡洋艦二艘，頗足顯示德軍威勇。據德國新聞社前綫消息，瑟堡要　德軍奮戰經過如次：要塞司令亨諾根海軍少將至二十五日下午一時二十分，依然不斷報吿猶克砲台及朗德邁爾砲台連絡情形，布羅迷海軍砲台時受陸上砲擊，至下午一時三十七分與布羅迷砲台連絡始吿斷絕，猶克砲合猛烈轟擊反軸心巡洋艦隊，同時亦時受陸上猛烈砲擊。下午一時四十六分德軍陣地遭敵砲火猛射，瑟堡市街已全為猛烈砲火所籠罩，下午二時零二分漢堡及猶克各砲台，不顧陸上海上猛烈砲火，對反軸心艦隊加以砲擊，下午二時三十二分反軸心艦隊卒行後退，敵巡洋艦一艘中彈起火，漢堡砲台擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，擊毀其他一艘。下午二時四十分猶克漢堡朗德邁爾各砲合在敵軍砲擊及低空轟炸之下，依然繼續砲戰，下午三時反軸心艦隊自砲台射程以外，時向瑟堡砲合以榴　彈襲擊，下午三時十五分砲兵司令尙報吿猶克及漢堡兩守備隊將士猶在繼續奮戰，時美軍己迫近四郊，乃展開白刃戰，德海軍砲台不避敵軍優勢軍力之攻擊，已達成其任務，瑟堡軍港之役，實為德海軍史上之光明一頁</p>
<h3>維特勃斯克　巷戰進行中　蘇攻勢以明斯克為目標</h3>
<p>安加拉二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，莫斯科消息：蘇軍司令部星期日夜公報，維特勃斯克現正巷戰，該處有德軍步兵五師。</p>
<p>瑞克要衝前方三百公里一帶，演成壯烈之血戰。綜合前綫消息，該四主要戰區之戰况如下：　巴勃羅斯克東方之蘇軍，擬奪回巴勃羅斯克，由羅迦契夫及茲羅寳兩市開始進攻，德軍當局宣稱，該方面之德軍于二十四日後退數公里，據守新陣地而勇敢戰鬥中。　奧爾厦方面蘇軍為取得斯麾倫斯克至明斯克之公路熾烈進攻，然德方之防禦力極為强大，致使蘇軍未能如願前進。　維特勃斯克方面蘇軍擬包圍攻陷維特勃斯克，而先向波羅庫及明斯克兩巿方面猛進。據德軍前綫消息，蘇軍曾形成突出部，刻正遭受德軍之抵抗。</p>
<h3>三年作戰蘇軍損失十六</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊二德國負責方面稱，蘇軍被俘者已達五·六五〇。〇〇〇人，關於坦克車大炮飛機之損失，莫斯科僅宣佈半數，據德國估計三年來蘇軍損失坦克車九三·四二〇輛，大砲八八·六四六尊，及飛機五七·九五四架。</p>
<h3>東西戰綫互相呼應</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　當義大利戰綫反軸心軍節節進展，諾曼第戰錢美軍完全包圍瑟堡之際，東部戰綫之蘇軍似與之相呼應，而於全長二千公里中八百公里之北中兩路綫，展開一大攻勢。蘇軍攻勢之重點如下：第一，自阿尼牙河經莫奇列夫至奧爾廈一帶，其中間為奧爾廈舊戰塲，蘇軍之主要目的在於維持斯麾倫斯克·奧爾廈·明斯克間之汽車路。第二，維特勃斯克兩側，該地區亦為一九四一年懲軍開始東部戰綫攻勢以來再三　戰之地。第三，泰羅庫東方地區之蘇軍攻勢，規模較小，可視為對維特勃斯克奧爾厦主要戰綫之牽制作戰。第四，奧斯特羅夫北東兩方以包圍奧斯特羅夫為目標之攻擊。出動於各戰錢之部隊，為蘇軍波勃夫梅列科夫·哥奧羅夫各將軍麾下之四師，由地　勢觀之，其企圖似在維持斯摩倫斯克·奧爾廈·明斯克間之東西幹綫道路。德軍最高常局鑒於蘇軍當以一地區實行偽裝作戰，而驅其主力突破其他地區，或於一定之時間及處所，逐次展開種種陣勢，實施不同之分段作戰。又根據德機偵察結果，由蘇軍機材之案結情形觀之，二十二日以來驟然活潑之中部戰綫非為主要作戰，而似集主力於中南部戰綫。德軍當局認為蘇軍或於泰諾波爾至波蘭平原一帶，與德軍展開一大決戰，而北法戰綫亦或展開與諾曼第作戰併行之第二登陸作戰，故德軍業有萬全準備，德軍深知蘇軍之全而進擊，必與美英之第二戰綫有關，故於去年冬季退至預定綫後，即築有十分鞏固之防衛綫，故主要戰塲置於北法東部戰綫為第二重要之戰塲，對於義大利半島之敵軍攻勢，則利用迅速集結有效兵力之內綫作戰，摧毀敵軍主力，對於蘇軍之全面攻勢，亦以冷靜之百信，靜觀戰局之發展。</p>
<h3>畢昂比諾港德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，軍息：義北部沿岸畢昂比諾港（Piombino）之德守軍及義本土沿岸之德海軍砲隊，頃已向北撤退，以免被北上之敵軍包圍，該德軍根據地之砲隊及重要設施，均被炸毀，德守軍於未撤退前，曾不斷砲擊對岸厄爾巴島之敵方砲位</p>
<h3>凡爾賽空襲　死傷七百</h3>
<p>巴黎二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：此間報戰反軸心機於星期六晨空襲凡爾賽，死傷約七百名，內有炸死者二二五名，開往巴黎之火車一列被炸，乘客炸死多人。又奧爾良於二十日及二十三日二次被襲，平民死三百五十人，據巴黎晚報息，凡爾賽全城均遭炸及。</p>
<h3>渝方發行　千元鈔票</h3>
<p>中央社訊　渝方最近發行一千元及五百元鈔票兩種，已於月初流通，惟對於發行巨額券之理由，則未的說明。按去年度渝方之總預算額，為三百六十萬萬元，而收入方面，僅有關稅一萬萬四千二百四十萬元，戰時消費稅九萬萬元，直接稅廿一萬二千五百萬元，總稅三萬七千八百七十萬元，烟酒稅五億六千萬元，礦稅三萬七千八百九十萬元，土地稅三十四萬一千四百八十萬兀，新統稅三萬四千萬元，　稅四萬一千七百五十萬元，食　專賣收入十萬零五千零五十萬元，砂　六萬八千四百四十萬元，火柴七千七百五十萬元，香烟六萬〇〇十萬元，總計一百十萬零六千九百八十萬元。此外另有所謂「勝利公債」三十萬萬元，糧食庫券六十三萬九千萬元，糧食儲蓄券七萬九千七百萬元，亦不過二百十二億五千六百八十萬元，距原支出預算之三百六十萬萬元，仍差一百五十一萬四千四百六十一萬元之鉅。因此不能不發行巨額鈔票，以圖彌補收入之不足，此其一。而太年之新預算，較去年又已增加甚鉅，據聞總額約在七百萬萬元左右，是尤有發行巨額鈔票，以支持已有崩潰危機之金融體　之必要，此其二。同時河南及湖南方面日軍，此次發動新作戰後，渝軍主要據點洛陽及長沙，相繼陷落，和平區域益形擴大，巾儲券需要乃愈繁，故我政府當局，此次發行五百元券之原因，雖係循銀錢兩菜之要求，而另一方面，實亦因新和平區需要故也。反之，則渝方屢失據點，軍事根據旣日漸喪失，政治立塲更不能使人民保持信賴，因之物價愈高漲，物資愈缺乏，遂造成整個經濟基礎之動搖，故尤不能不提高通貨票面金額，以圖收支之平衡。實則其內部旣已有如是之重要艱困，當可知此次發行兩種巨額鈔票，絕對不能掩飾其金融基礎之動搖，及其治下人民心理之恐慌也</p>
<p>設置於農商省內的推進戰事食糧增產中央本部，本月十三日舉行第一屆聯合會議，十四日舉行第一屆顧問會，積極從事具體的活動。農商省於十三日發表推進戰事食糧增產中央本部的內部機構與職制，大部分仍利用現農商省原有機構，中央太部決定之事項，立即以之為行政上各種施策付之實施，更使以有關各廳的關係官所組織的戰時食　協義會及農業報團推進隊，發生直接有機的聯繫，並使各地負責推進食糧增產者亦得隨時活動。</p>

<h3>瑪里亞納羣島　重大戰局感想　大陸新報尾坂理事長廣播演說</h3>
<p>大陸新報社理事長尾坂與一，於二十五日下午九時在上海廣播電台，就瑪里亞那羣島作戰，發表廣播演說，其要旨如次：</p>
<h3>戰術拙劣　必歸失敗</h3>
<p>余現擬就目下激戰中之瑪里亞納羣島之重大戰局，略述感想。余就目前戰局，加以冷眼觀察，可斷言「敵美業巳敗北。」凡一切用兵作戰，如將自身實力分敵為二，實最為拙劣。失敗原因，亦即根基於此。如敵美在歐洲第二戰綫，旣傾注大半兵力，而在太平洋戰綫，又復集中剩餘全力，即係此種情形。敵美之所以取此項暴舉，必對於日本採在內南洋方面航空兵力，作過少評價。如就塞班島之出擊，加以考慮，實為其一大冒險舉動。蓋敵以為一旦攻擊塞班島，日軍必將出面應戰，便可一舉加以擊滅，而解決太平洋戰事，且以如能將塞班島收於掌握，則與東京距離可縮至一·二六八海運，與菲律賓距離可縮至一干五百海浬，再以B29號爆擊機實施轟炸，即可將東京，火阪，名古屋，橫濱，菲律濱等地，均置於制空圈之下。西太平洋之制空權旣予確保，再繼之掌握制海權，即可將日本與南洋之聯絡截斷，</p>
<h3>日軍獲得　空前戰果</h3>
<p>敵美以太平洋艦隊之大部份，計由航空母艦二十餘艘，及戰艦十餘艘，所構成之機動部隊，率領輸送船百餘艘，於十一日開始攻擊塞班島，屢攻屬北，直至十五日第三次實施上陸作戰，始得派約二師兵力登睦成功，並於四周出動艦隊，加以包圍，除以艦載機實施轟炸外，同時並以艦砲射擊。帝國海軍，對於敵方之此種行動，早所預料，早經暗地進行準備，靜待殲敵時機之來臨，果於十二日至十八日，由我航空隊進行奮戰，並於十九日至二十日，由我一部份聯合艦隊堂堂出擊，二十三日，更經航空隊之積极活躍，計先後擊沉擊毀戰艦四艘，航空艦十一艘以上，擊沉巡洋艦六艘，驅遂艦一艘，艦型未詳軍艦一艘，潛水艦一艘，擊沉擊毀輸送船六艘，擊落擊毀飛機四百餘架，實為夏威夷珍珠灣以來之最大戰果，對於敵所出動之全部機動部隊，雖尚未能獲得決定大勢之戰果，然敵己因此開始向飛行機轟炸圈外，實施逃避作戰則可斷言。</p>
<h3>兵站遙遠　困難甚多</h3>
<p>查近代海戰之性質，與往年之日本海海戰完全異趣，因艦隊裝備之進步，航空機發達後行動半徑之增大，戰塲之廣泛等等，致作戰日益困難，例如海面並空間之占有，已成為毫無意義。唯有直接擊滅敵　或覆滅敵之飛行基地，潰滅敵之航空兵力，斯為必要條件。又相隔數百　，雙方不分晝夜，展開索敵作戰，由此可見近代戰之複雜深刻，決非普通人想像中之簡單，故欲求自身毫無損害，而獲得大勝利，實不可能，在此一戰役，我方計亦喪失航空母艦一艘，附屬油船二艘，並飛機五十架，此次之戰局，實具有開戰以來最大而最重要之性格。戰時兵站綫之重要，可無待贅言，然敵美兵站基地最近之馬紹爾，亦相距一千數百浬，如此遙遠之兵站綫，實為向所未見，其困難之甚，自在意中。反之，我方則可由國內經小笠原羣島源源補給，極為便利，以逸待勞，敵軍擊滅可期。</p>
<h3>華萊士赴渝目的　加强對渝壓迫　松平部長發表談話</h3>
<p>盟邦日本大使館上海事務所，於昨（二十六）日下午二時牛，循例假南京路外灘華　飯店八樓，招待木市中國新聞記者舉行報道常會，大使館方面計到松平情報部長，福間副領事等，即席由松平部長就此次美副總統華萊士之赴渝目的，詳述綦詳。茲分誌如次：</p>
<h3>赴渝目的</h3>
<p>松平情報部長首謂：美副總統華萊士，於本月二十日抵渝後，迭與蔣介石會談四五次之多，於二十四日竟發表簡單的共同聲明，觀其內容，詳稱：「關於基本原則及目的，雙方意見完全一致，同時並再確認相互援助對日戰爭」云云。松平氏　謂：據渠所得消息，華之赴渝目的，乃企圖阻止渝政權內部發生國家主義之傾向，同時並阻止渝方恢復東亞之動向。査最近英美兩國之言論機關，猛烈攻擊蔣介石所著「中國之命運」認為有反動，及有排外思想，此外對渝之五五憲法，亦嚴施攻擊為並非民主主義，並又嗾使駐渝記者，要求所謂曾論自由，此即英美阻止渝方自覺所用之手段。</p>
<h3>壓迫重慶</h3>
<p>松平部長又謂：最近渝共發生廢　時，重慶即以中共為一個爭取政權的政黨，坦然解決共黨，在英美方面以渝對共黨之態度，認為反動及全體主義態度，壓迫重慶對共讓步。自開羅會議舉行以後之重慶，雖有相當興奮之空氣，惟於本年三月以後，由於渝物價　　，糧食尤感不足，對外則因　日本先發制人展開印緬國境作戰，釀成印度獨立運動之熾烈，及河南方面之作戰，又出乎意想之外日軍神速進展，引起渝軍政民惴惴不安，有重歸東亞之　望。因此，美立即派遣華萊士企圖阻止。最後松平氏又謂，據我人觀測，今後美對渝要求更大，日壓迫亦愈廣，將來渝最高指導者之所有行動，被迫從美國之指使，而渝所希望之自覺越狹，如此不僅對大東亞之發展，實有害無益。澈底滌除烟毒刷新市容起見，特令司法處設置烟賭査緝科，挑選優良員警，充任査緝工作，將於七月一日正式成立，開始工作，從嚴查緝烟土毒品之製造及販賣罪犯。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　建議各公會創辦職工子弟助學金</h3>
<p>— 龍</p>
<p>近一個月來，因為米價不正常的波動，各層階級，莫不受到重大的影響，尤其是下學期學費一事，最為嚴重。如酌加少許，學校方面，常然有難以維持之苦，如遞增過巨（例如近日風傳中之學費折米方策），則家長方面，更屬十九束手一籌莫展。</p>
<p>蓋所謂家長者，大都為薪水附級，他們月俸所入，追論八口之家，將有斷餐之處，即個人生活，亦有不易茍全者。申新兩報，雖有助學金及貸學金之舉，何如粥少僧多，究難普及。回顧各求。除極少數之例外者外，其餘大郡資力雄厚。即以吾五金洋雜新藥等業而言，歷年以還，叨特殊之賜，成為大之驕子，資產價值，一綫直上。每一公會，如能同其所屬會員募集數百萬兀或數千萬兀，充作職工于弟之助學金，誠輕而易舉，一蹴可成。竊念各業同業公會中之理監事，皆為人中之鳳，有聲於時，而夙為各界人士所景仰者，當能目光如炬，發此宏願，替一般職工的子弟們打開一條血路，俾獲繼續求學之機會，問接為國家分擔一些天職，亦即為自己的子孫造福。</p>
<p>最近報載蛋業與熱水瓶業兩公會，均已在舉辦職工子弟之助學事宜，而常州同鄉會等，亦曾有　續辦理助學金之聲明，想其他各業公會暨各同鄉會，實力不遜於上列諸會，何患不能急起直追，並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>雖然，各業公會或各同鄉會，如有認為對於出錢一事，無有問題者，則對於出力一事，不妨委託申新兩報分任之，以收駕輕就熟之效，想兩報當局，素以樂育英才引爲已責，必不見刦也。</p>

<p>「他香烟也喜歡，燒　也喜歡。」</p>

<p>「真一郞兄陣亡了，當在鹿兒島新聞上看到時，令我不勝扼腕！」</p>
<p>「是的，終於哥哥先我而死了。」</p>
<p>眞人慢慢地，鎭靜地這樣說。</p>
<p>「你也是軍人，你或許在什麼時候也要列入陣亡將士碑的。」</p>
<p>「…」</p>
<p>眞人眼睛望着下而微笑着，用叉子叉柿子。</p>
<p>「談到這個地方，縱令我終身拚命畫軍艦，也不會名列陣亡將士碑的。想到這樣地方，真命人悶煞！」</p>
<p>「不應富想這些事。你也好，我也好，在日本國民這一點上說，是亳無二致的。如果認為只有軍人可享受令名，我想這是不對的。」</p>
<p>這話說的聲音很低，但力量却很大。隆夫沈默了片刻。</p>
<p>「那末，我們走吧！「</p>
<p>眞人呌僕歐算賬。隆夫急忙阻止他，說東京是自己的居住地，自然應當作東道主，但真人笑着說：</p>
<p>「我巴經領薪水了。你不是還仰賴家庭維持生活麼？」</p>
<p>隆夫一聽到這樣話，就不再爭着付賬，而只是搔撓頭頂。</p>
<p>兩個人雖然出了飯館，但誰也不想分開。同時，兩個人又不是能接連喝酒的人。</p>

        <h1>1944.06.27</h1>
<h3>Editorial: Seize the Opportunity</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of increasing agricultural production, especially grain production, we have raised it several times for the authorities' reference and to promote public attention. In today's extremely serious grain problem, the fundamental method of increasing production is indeed an urgent plan that cannot be delayed or relaxed. Allied nations such as Japan are constantly striving for excellence in increasing production during wartime, both in industry and agriculture, constantly reviewing and seeking progress. However, the conditions of the Allied nations in industrial and agricultural production, such as equipment, technology, raw materials, transportation, etc., are all stronger than ours, and we cannot hope to reach them. However, they are still not satisfied and are constantly making reforms and progress to adapt to the environment and maximize efficiency. On the other hand, the situation in our country is scattered. Although there are production increase plans, the effectiveness of implementation is still questionable. We feel even more admiration and shame for the unremitting spirit of our ally Japan.</p>
<p>Today, our newspaper selects and translates two articles about our ally Japan promoting food production. Although the specific methods are different from our current situation and cannot be fully adopted, the spirit of enthusiastic production increase and adaptation to the environment is sufficient to provide us with examples to catch up. In particular, the translation and commentary state: "In the past, for the purpose of expanding factory production, there was no time to consider anything else when absorbing workers. Now, due to the adjustment of military and civilian factory production and the improvement of factory labor management, it is considered possible to transfer redundant employees from factories to rural areas. This can be seen as a result of reflection based on the demands of the serious war situation, and it is truly a epoch-making policy." This further illustrates how Japan is humbly reviewing the facts and reflecting on finding more reasonable policies that can adapt to the requirements. This is especially worthy of our vigilance and imitation.</p>
<p>Recently, the rice price in this city has shown a slight rebound due to the continuous supply. If the entire control mechanism is improved and the overall plan can be widely implemented in various places, it is believed that the rice price will return to normal, which is very possible. Unfortunately, there are too many minor problems. Even if there are temporary emergency measures, the effect is minimal. In short, the food problem is a permanent problem. The fundamental solution lies in increasing production. It is hoped that the主管 authorities will pay attention to studying the production increase plan at any time, earnestly implement it, and strive to gradually achieve results. Regarding the current food problem in this city, we still advocate stepping up the smooth flow of sources, and must fully facilitate transportation and along the way checkpoints. According to a person from Qingpu, the Qingpu County Government originally had an order prohibiting the export of rice. When this city requested that the ban be lifted for three days, porters were transporting rice from morning to night, shoulder to shoulder, and regardless of young or old, men or women, they all went out as temporary rice sellers. From this, it can be seen that, first, there is absolutely no surplus rice in the producing area. Second, there is no one transporting rice from the producing area. The problem lies in whether there is an overall plan and passage along the way. If the government has an overall plan and can implement it in all rice-producing areas, so that transporters can make a profit, and there is no harassment or obstruction along the way, then the source can be continuously unblocked and there will be no panic.</p>
<p>There are still two months before the new grain is harvested. The source after two months can naturally increase in quantity. Based on the experience gained last year, in these two months, we hope that the authorities will quickly plan to reform the rice control mechanism and adjust personnel issues, eliminate all past obstacles, be reasonable and smooth the source. Time flies, and the two months will be here in a blink of an eye. Seize the opportunity and don't miss it.</p>
<h3>Translated Commentary: A Help to Promoting Food Production</h3>
<p>The increase in food production is the basis for stabilizing the people's lives, and it progresses in conjunction with the increase in military demand, like interlocking gears, to consolidate the road to victory. The person in charge, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, has previously set up a central promotion headquarters related to wartime food production, and decided on a policy of requesting cooperation from all parties. On the 12th and 14th, it conducted various discussions focusing on the issue of increasing rice and wheat production. The necessary methods for increasing the production of major foods such as rice and wheat and general agricultural products do not need to be said, and cannot be exhausted in a few words. What I want to say here, in addition to the sowing of rice and the harvesting of wheat, I intend to briefly describe my views on the supplement and utilization of labor shortages in rural areas today before the busy farming season, as follows:</p>
<p>Originally, one of the characteristics of agriculture in our country is the small-scale operation of many families on small plots of land. However, in today's wartime, the area of strict land and the amount of agricultural labor have been greatly reduced, which is unavoidable. The authorities established a system of essential agricultural personnel on the job in February of this year, and engaged in the coordination of agricultural and industrial labor and the ensuring of rural labor. Now, in order to keep rural labor in its original state, we are also starting to plan for students and non-farm laborers and the training of female labor, in order to make up for this shortcoming. However, recently, the agricultural and commercial authorities have further realized the need to mobilize rural workers, and have also given special consideration to the mobilization of factory workers to rural areas.</p>
<p>Therefore, not only strengthening the agricultural mobilization of students and children related to agriculture and rural areas, but also, when necessary, planning to mobilize students who are currently employed in factories and students who are scheduled to be mobilized in factories to rural areas, and even factory workers who are employed, are also planned to be mobilized to rural areas. These are indeed noteworthy facts. In the past, for the purpose of expanding factory production, there was no time to consider anything else when absorbing workers. Now, due to the adjustment of military and civilian factory production and the improvement of factory labor management, it is considered possible to transfer redundant employees from factories to rural areas. This can be seen as a result of reflection based on the demands of the serious war situation, and it is truly a epoch-making policy. The question here is when and where should these factory workers be sent? This will probably depend on the actual situation of each factory and rural area, and will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The most effective way to increase food production is, of course, to have factory workers and students return to rural areas. Here, there may be many difficulties in transportation and other circumstances, but in view of the precedent of the military implementing the return home system during the busy farming season, this may not be impossible. The fathers, brothers, and children who are engaged in factory labor can once again be with their families. What a happiness this will be for the agricultural families and villages in terms of spirit and production! The benefits of the integration of rural areas and factories are truly immeasurable.</p>
<p>In this way, the unique defense of the family's agricultural production, which is inherent in our country, will be able to be further developed, and this god of family production must immediately be expanded to the spirit of production of neighbors and the country. There is no need for the use of neighborly spirit as urgently as in today's agricultural production. No matter which village you go to, the old, weak, women, and children are all engaged in labor, and young and middle-aged men are called to the battlefield and factories. Even if there are very few healthy men left, for themselves, for their neighbors, for the caretakers of friends, and for the entire tribe, they cannot but bear two or three heavy labors.</p>
<p>In addition, seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural tools are all distributed through the neighborly system, and the system of rice offering and rewards is basically based on the tribal unit of the neighborly system for joint and several liability. Furthermore, the arrangement of cultivated land and drainage are not the responsibility of each farmer on their own. The spirit of mutual assistance between neighbors implemented in military rescue, childcare, and other undertakings should also be fully applied to labor service, the use of agricultural machinery, and the operation of agricultural labor. Even if they are all old, weak, women, and children, and there are a few men, in order to enable them to support each other and move forward on the road to increased production, it really depends on the inherent neighborly spirit of our country to promote food production, which is also a great help.

<h3>Japanese Air Force Repeatedly Bombs Fiercely; Fierce Battle Day and Night on Saipan Island; More Than 100 Enemy Planes Shot Down in Attack on Omiya Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - On Saipan Island, the Japanese air force cooperated with ground battles and dispatched repeatedly to attack the enemy at night. On the 25th, they bombed the enemy's position in the Garapan area of the island, the Saipan Shrine, and the hilly area of Rollo, the enemy's position near Aslito Airport, the enemy's military supplies depot, and boat groups.</p>
<p>Tokyo, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - The land battle on Saipan Island has been very fierce in recent days. The battle situation on the 24th is as follows: The enemy's attack on Saipan Island, Needless to say, the enemy's attack on Saipan Island continues at night, with a large number of ships cruising in the sea near the island, using searchlights and flares to carry out fierce artillery fire. Under the rain of bullets, the enemy gradually advances north with the army. The local Japanese army immediately intercepts and engages in a bloody battle with the enemy. By the night of the 24th, the Japanese army still maintains the main line of the city of Garapan and Mount Tapochau (44 meters above sea level), the highest peak of the island. It also goes out to attack from time to time or creates opportunities to dive into the enemy's position, fire artillery to prevent the enemy from using Aslito Airport, and destroy the enemy's artillery positions. In short, although the Japanese army is in a difficult situation, its morale is still very high and it is still fighting hard.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Central Unit Attacks Hengyang Airport and Advances on US Air Force Base in Chongqing</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army base in Hunan, June 26th, Central News Agency Urgent Telegram - The Central Unit of the Japanese Chinese Expeditionary Force is continuing to attack along the Yuehan Line. At dawn on the 24th, it attacked a corner of Hengyang Airport, an important defense of the Yuehan Line and the forward base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing. It immediately defeated the stubborn resistance of about two divisions of the Chongqing 10th Army defending the airport and is currently expanding its battle results. According to the report, this is the first time that the attack on the US Air Force base stationed in Chongqing has been successful in this operation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - A Reuters correspondent in Chongqing said on the 25th, explaining the situation of the Japanese army's attack on Weiyang, an important strategic location in Hunan, that according to reports from the front line, the vanguard of the Japanese army has approached a location five kilometers east of Weiyang. The Japanese army advancing south along the Yuehan Line has also reached locations nine and a half kilometers northeast of Hengyang and sixteen kilometers east. In addition, the Japanese army advancing south from the east side of the Yuehan Road has also crossed Laishui and is now turning west, reaching a location about five and a half kilometers from Weiyang.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - According to a Chongqing telegram, the Chongqing military authorities announced on the 25th that the battle situation in Hunan is as follows: Fierce battles have broken out on the Hengyang defense line. After arriving at Leixi City, the Japanese army crossed the Moshui River (a tributary of the Xiangjiang River) at noon on the 24th and attacked various locations about ten kilometers northeast of Hengyang and seventeen kilometers east. In addition, another Japanese army crossed Guashui and launched an attack, advancing westward and fighting in the area about six kilometers west of Weiyang. The battle is currently progressing throughout the entire area. Another Japanese unit broke into Pingxiang in the morning of the 24th.</p>
<p>The Japanese army occupied Youxian Hubei, an important base. A certain Japanese army base on the front line, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - The Japanese army's rapid unit went south along the Wanyang Mountains and captured Pingxiang on the 22nd. Taking advantage of the momentum, it advanced rapidly and occupied Youxian on the 25th, an important defense point for the Chongqing army defending Hengyang. After the Japanese army broke through the Yingyang Mountains, it advanced south and destroyed the Chongqing army's 26th Army from the Third War Zone, and occupied the area near Pingxiang in one fell swoop. Another unit also responded to this, destroying the remnants of the Chongqing army's 20th Army, 37th Army, and 44th Army near Liling, and annihilating the Chongqing army's second army, which was defeated and retreated from Zhuzhou, thus completing the capture of Youxian.</p>
<p>Lisbon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram - According to a Reuters important correspondent, the battle situation in Hunan is as follows: Hengyang is an important strategic location in Hunan, and has been a place contended for by military strategists since ancient times. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, it has become the most important industrial, commercial, and transportation center in Central and Southern China, because it is located at the intersection of the Yuehan and Xianggui railways, and is therefore the transportation center between South China and Sichuan Province. Therefore, if Hengyang falls into the hands of the Japanese army, not only will the Chongqing and US air forces lose a major base, but the land connection between western and eastern China will also fall into a difficult situation. Furthermore, if the Japanese army secures Hengyang and then occupies the entire Yuehan Road, it can further attack Guilin in the southwest and Guangdong in the southeast. If this is the case, the situation will become even more serious. The Chongqing army, which is poorly equipped, cannot prevent the Japanese army's armored units from advancing along the railway or highway. It is expected that the Chongqing military headquarters will attempt to counterattack after the Japanese army's transportation has been stretched to saturation or after the Japanese army has broken into the mountains of Hunan.</p>

<h3>General and School Officers Telegraph Respect to Chairman</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Central Army General and School Officer Training Corps, the second term of the Advanced Military Science Research Class, and the eighth term of the Cadre Corps students have all achieved good results through rigorous training. Today (27th) a joint graduation ceremony was held. It is reported that Mr. Xiao Shuyi, the commander and education director of the regiment, sent a telegram of respect on behalf of all officers and students, because the concurrently commander General Wang is in Japan's allied country recovering from illness. The text of the telegram is as follows: Chinese Embassy in Tokyo forwards to Commander Wang Junjian, the 281 students of the second term of the High Research Class and the eighth term of the Cadre Corps of this regiment held a graduation ceremony today. At this time when the commander is abroad for medical treatment, we should work harder in training and education, and dare not slacken off, in order to live up to expectations. The students have always been inspired and know how to study diligently. A few months ago, they practiced in the summer heat, passing through Suzhou and Changzhou, and were able to strictly abide by military discipline. The graduation results this time are also better than the previous terms, which can relieve these concerns. Recently, I learned that your body is recovering, and the common people are relying on it. The whole regiment is even more inspired. After the students return to their defenses, they will certainly do their best to improve the troops and repay the kindness of cultivation, and dedicate themselves to repay the country. I reverently telegraph my respects. Xiao Shuxuan, commander and education director of the Central Army General and School Officer Training Corps, leads all officers and students to kowtow in gratitude.</p>
<h3>Jian Department Determined to Rectify Road Police</h3>
<p>Nanjing, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. The Jian Department spares no effort in rectifying the road police, but in the past, the road police were too corrupt and the accumulated habits were difficult to change, so the effectiveness achieved in a short period of time was very small. In the past, they could only check passengers and their luggage and were only responsible for maintaining order at the station. Regarding this point, I hope that all sectors of society will be aware of it. We will implement rectification as a whole, hoping that the road police can eliminate corruption and earnestly take on the responsibility of loving the road and protecting the people. In order to practice the Asian Wing-Praise Movement and communicate Chinese and Japanese ideas and culture, the Oriental Culture Research Institute was established and started to employ people of prestige from all walks of life. Now the institute has officially changed its name to the East Asian Worldview Research Institute. It not only studies abstract theories, but also establishes itself on thought and conducts research that combines knowledge and action, in order to compete with the Asian Wing-Praise Association and become one of its important affiliated institutions. It also maintains all relations with the Chinese side, conducts research and investigations, establishes lectures, publishes publications, provides itinerant guidance, and convenes lectures and seminars at any time, in order to open a new era for the establishment of the future worldview of Chinese and Japanese thought. Its future is indeed worth looking forward to.</p>
<h3>Professor Nikawa Hara Publishes Remarks on Post-Greater East Asia Political Organization</h3>
<p>Tokyo, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. Professor Tsugiji Suwara of the Central University here argues that the political organization of post-Greater East Asia should be based on the "order of the family" to carry out all new construction. His remarks are as follows: No matter what country it is, there is no one who does not hope for the maintenance and development of his motherland, and the existence of countries under order, in short, is caused by non-oppositional, that is, selfish people. This kind of mutual opposition and selfishness is used to dream of ensuring world domination and obtaining profits from it, which is the fundamental concept of the current British and American world policy, and is also the biggest reason for the outbreak of this war. There is no reason for a country to exist in isolation or opposition. There are not many countries that can be self-sufficient economically, so the concept of a world economy has arisen. The old world economic order believed that everything could be satisfied with money, so there was often a danger of destroying this order due to political influence. A world economy is not possible without a world political background. The League of Nations was once a kind of world political organization, but because Britain and France turned this kind of political system into a tool to protect their own interests, it collapsed. At the same time, the world economy was also impossible to realize. Until now, the only way for several countries with the same destiny to cooperate with each other to seek the survival of the country is "having and not having in common" and "coexistence and co-prosperity." The ideal of building a wide-area economic zone and a co-prosperity sphere has arisen because of this, which is a historical necessity. However, a wide-area economic zone can never be realized if it does not abandon the individualism and separatism caused by the old order principle. The principle of "order of the family" can be applied to groups, and a large wide-area economic zone can be formed. The combination between individualists is based on mutual exploitation. On the contrary, the combination of families is entirely based on morality, which is the way for the coexistence of the whole and the few. Individualism even advocates abandoning the family, such as the Nomie thought of the elder son leaving the family, which represents the root thought of modern Europe, but in East Asia, both husband and wife are regarded as part of the family, and are indispensable cells for the formation of the whole. Leaving the whole means not being able to survive, which is the fundamental ideal of the family. The new order of the world in the future must be based on this principle in order to prevent the recurrence of war. Japan is currently using this kind of ideal to complete the construction of the new order of Greater East Asia. The Japanese state is based on the familial state order, and it will expand this kind of order to the entire East Asia and then present it to the world. Under the control of machinery is the postwar management theory of Britain and the United States, in other words, it can also be said to have the political concept of a police state. Taking the destruction of order as an excuse to do whatever they want, if they hold this kind of concept, they will never be able to eradicate the root of disaster.</p>

<h3>President Bose of the Free Indian Government Issues Statement and Is Confident That German Forces Will Win in Western Europe</h3>
<p>Rangoon, June 26th, Central News Agency Telegram. Jiangtara Bose, president of the Provisional Government of Free India, issued a statement on the 25th regarding the start of the Allied forces' landing operation in Western Europe, as follows: The European invasion operation promoted by Britain and the United States has finally begun. This kind of move not only does not shake the Axis camp, but also causes many complaints among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. As far as Germany is concerned, before the start of this operation, the German army repeatedly challenged Britain and the United States, hoping to start the final decisive battle as soon as possible. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States also requested to open a second front. The Soviet army also questioned whether Britain and the United States were sincere in opening a second front, while Britain and the United States extended the deadline for two years with various excuses. As a result, the landing operation that was launched cannot be credited to themselves. The Soviet Union knew the intentions of Britain and the United States from the very beginning of the landing operation. Soviet newspapers such as "War and Labor Class Magazine" criticized the actions of Britain and the United States as inappropriate and did not recognize this European invasion operation as a real second front. Britain and the United States had to deal with Germany in order to fulfill the agreement with the Moscow government. When the operation was launched, Britain's ambition to dominate the earth and America's dream of restraining the world faced the crisis of being shattered. As a result of the fierce battles on the coast of France, the Anti-Axis has lost a lot of manpower, material resources, and resources. After the German army's unmanned planes demonstrated in London and southern England, all parts of Britain felt panicked, and the bombing of the London area still continues day and night. Therefore, the warlords of London and Washington must regret that they should not have launched the suicide landing operation. In fact, the atmosphere in Britain and the United States is extremely pessimistic. On the contrary, Germany's bear-like attitude is as usual, and it is confident to start a decisive battle with Britain and the United States. I have stayed in Germany for a long time to visit wartime Germany, so I know the internal strength of Germany very well. Therefore, I am confident that the German army will be able to completely annihilate the British and American troops who have landed. The American forces are divided between Asia and Europe, so all freedom-loving Indians welcome this fact, because the German army's launch of a destruction war against the British and American forces is most beneficial to the Indian National Army's independent struggle.</p>
<h3>Northern France Tank Battles: Tilly Reduced to Ruins, Enemy Fleet Discovered at the Mouth of the Orne</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency, citing official German war reports, stated: Yesterday, the enemy launched a strong infantry and tank offensive against the Tilly area, eventually occupying the ruins of the city, but suffering extremely heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – A Huitong News Agency war correspondent, Webb, reported: Fierce fighting has been taking place since yesterday morning twenty kilometers west of Caen in the area of Le, which is the right flank of the anti-Axis bridgehead, no more than twenty kilometers deep. The current center of the British offensive is about six kilometers wide, with a force of about four divisions, including two tank divisions. The attack began around 7:00 AM after about five and a half hours of shelling, and fierce fighting is ongoing. So far, the Central Army has only penetrated about 1,000 meters at one point. Enemy naval and air forces are assisting in the operation, and German aircraft and artillery are also keeping pace. It is expected that the fighting in the Tilly area may expand to Caen in the coming days. The main objectives of the British forces are clearly the Bogage-Caen highway and the area south of Caen near the Orne.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) – According to a Huitong News Agency report, Reuters received official information today that British forces have occupied Tilly, and the attacking forces have advanced to within 1,000 yards of the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported: The main event on the Western European front this week was the large-scale American offensive against the Cherbourg fortress. There are also noteworthy developments in other areas. German positions on the east bank of the Orne River and between the Dives River (which flows into the Seine Bay east of the Orne River) have been under heavy Anglo-American naval artillery fire all day, indicating that the anti-Axis forces are planning to launch a large-scale operation in the area soon, further expanding their bridgehead on the east bank of the Orne. The German side further anticipates that the anti-Axis high command will attempt to re-occupy the city of Caen and advance eastward from there, thereby increasing the depth of the bridgehead. This move will require the anti-Axis forces to deploy more troops, and there is currently insufficient space for them to use. These intentions of the enemy have become increasingly clear. The enemy launched a major offensive on a broad front in the Tilly area on Sunday, which is a testament to this. According to early reports, although British forces temporarily breached some gaps in the German front lines in multiple attacks in the Tilly area, they were ultimately repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The British have assembled a large convoy of supply ships and landing craft, numbering about 350, totaling 270,000 tons, and are using a large number of warships to protect them from naval artillery bombardment and aerial attacks, attempting to suppress the German coastal artillery east of the Orne River. However, German defensive fire still sank two landing craft off the coast of Ri de Belra.</p>
<h3>The Final Battle for Cherbourg</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported military news: The final battle for Cherbourg took place at 8:00 PM last night, when the remaining German defenders telegraphed the German High Command, "The final battle for Cherbourg has begun. The commander is fighting alongside his men. Hail the Führer, Hail Greater Germany!" The great battle for Cherbourg has come to an end, and the port has fallen into the hands of the anti-Axis forces. The enemy used ten times the number of troops and war materiel of the German forces in an attempt to occupy the city yesterday. German officials released the following report on the final battle: After American tank units and infantry forces invaded the Cherbourg urban area from the south and east, the remaining German troops had only enough ammunition to last for a few hours. Enemy aircraft constantly attacked German defenses in the ruins, and enemy dive bombers also joined the battle, coordinating with their ground forces. Enemy fighters prevented the German air force from reinforcing the German defenders, and enemy warships bombarded the German defenders with heavy artillery, attacking them from all sides. However, the German troops still fought step by step, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Many enemy tanks were destroyed by landmines. The enemy reached the arsenal area at nearly 6:00 PM in the evening, and the fighting was particularly fierce. The enemy's attempt to surprise the German forces failed, and they ultimately occupied the area by bombarding the German forces with heavy artillery at close range. German defenders in the northeastern part of the Cotentin Peninsula are still fighting the enemy. The Roule fortress on the Cherbourg-Valognes road repelled all American attacks last night, and it is expected that the fighting around Cherbourg will continue.</p>
<h3>A Glorious Page in German War History</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Part of the American forces broke into a corner of Cherbourg city at noon on the 25th. German forces along the coastal batteries continued to resist. At 2:26 PM on the 25th, the anti-Axis warship fired a large-caliber gun, sinking two enemy cruisers, demonstrating the bravery of the German forces. According to front-line news from the German News Agency, the German defenders of the Cherbourg fortress fought fiercely as follows: Fortress Commander Rear Admiral Hennecke continued to report on the connection between the Youke battery and the Landemare battery until 1:20 PM on the 25th. The Brommy naval battery was under land-based artillery fire, and communication with the Brommy battery was cut off at 1:37 PM. The Youke battery fiercely bombarded the anti-Axis cruiser fleet while also being subjected to intense land-based artillery fire. At 1:46 PM, German positions were heavily shelled by enemy artillery, and the entire city of Cherbourg was shrouded in intense artillery fire. At 2:02 PM, the Hamburg and Youke batteries, regardless of intense land-based and sea-based artillery fire, shelled the anti-Axis fleet. At 2:32 PM, the anti-Axis fleet finally retreated. One enemy cruiser was hit and caught fire, and the Hamburg battery sank one enemy cruiser and damaged another. At 2:40 PM, the Youke, Hamburg, and Landemare batteries continued to engage in artillery battles under enemy artillery fire and low-altitude bombing. At 3:00 PM, the anti-Axis fleet shelled the Cherbourg batteries with shrapnel from outside the range of the batteries. At 3:15 PM, the artillery commander still reported that the soldiers of the Youke and Hamburg garrisons were continuing to fight fiercely. At this time, American forces had approached the outskirts and launched a bayonet charge. The German naval batteries, despite the attack by superior enemy forces, had accomplished their mission. The battle for the Cherbourg naval port is truly a bright page in the history of the German Navy.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting in Vitebsk: Soviet Offensive Aimed at Minsk</h3>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported from Moscow: The Soviet military headquarters announced in its Sunday night communiqué that street fighting is taking place in Vitebsk, which is defended by five German infantry divisions.</p>
<p>Three hundred kilometers in front of the crucial point of Riga has turned into a glorious and bloody battle. A summary of reports from the front lines indicates that the four major battle areas are: Soviet forces east of Bobruisk intend to recapture Bobruisk, launching offensives from the cities of Rogachev and Zlobin. German authorities claim that German forces in this area withdrew several kilometers on the 24th and are bravely fighting from new defensive positions. In the Orsha area, Soviet forces are fiercely attacking to secure the highway from Smolensk to Minsk, but German defenses are very strong, preventing the Soviet forces from advancing as desired. In the Vitebsk area, Soviet forces intend to encircle and capture Vitebsk, while also advancing rapidly towards the cities of Polotsk and Minsk. According to German front-line reports, Soviet forces have formed a salient, which is currently being resisted by German forces.</p>
<h3>Soviets Lost Sixteen in Three Years of War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported that German officials claimed that the number of Soviet prisoners of war has reached 5,650,000. Moscow has only announced half of the losses of tanks, artillery, and aircraft. According to German estimates, in the past three years, the Soviet Union has lost 93,420 tanks, 88,646 artillery pieces, and 57,954 aircraft.</p>
<h3>Eastern and Western Fronts Echo Each Other</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – As the anti-Axis forces on the Italian front make steady progress and the American forces in Normandy completely encircle Cherbourg, the Soviet forces on the Eastern Front seem to be echoing this, launching a major offensive on the northern and central routes, spanning 800 kilometers of the 2,000-kilometer front. The key points of the Soviet offensive are as follows: First, the area from the Anya River through Mogilev to Orsha, with the old battlefield of Orsha in the middle. The main objective of the Soviet forces is to maintain the Smolensk-Orsha-Minsk road. Second, the flanks of Vitebsk, which has repeatedly been the site of fierce fighting since the German offensive on the Eastern Front began in 1941. Third, the Soviet offensive in the area east of Rogachev is smaller in scale and can be regarded as a feint operation against the main Vitebsk-Orsha front. Fourth, the attack aimed at encircling Ostrov from the northeast and north of Ostrov. The units deployed on each front are four divisions under the command of Soviet Generals Popov, Merekov, and Gorov. From a topographical perspective, their intention seems to be to maintain the east-west trunk road between Smolensk, Orsha, and Minsk. The German High Command believes that the Soviet forces will use camouflage operations in one area and drive their main force to break through in other areas, or gradually deploy various formations at certain times and places to implement different segmented operations. Furthermore, according to German aircraft reconnaissance, judging from the congestion of Soviet equipment, the Central Front, which has suddenly become active since the 22nd, is not the main operation, but seems to be concentrating its main force on the central and southern fronts. German authorities believe that the Soviet forces may engage in a major decisive battle with the German forces in the area from Ternopil to the Polish plains, and that a second landing operation may also be launched on the Northern France front, concurrent with the Normandy operation. Therefore, the German forces have made full preparations. The German forces are well aware that the Soviet Union's full-scale attack must be related to the Second Front of the United States and Britain. Therefore, after retreating to the predetermined line last winter, they built a very solid defensive line. Therefore, the main battlefield is placed in Northern France, with the Eastern Front being the second most important battlefield. For the enemy offensive on the Italian peninsula, they will use the inner line of operations to quickly concentrate effective forces and destroy the enemy's main force. For the Soviet Union's full-scale offensive, they will also calmly observe the development of the war situation with full confidence.</p>
<h3>German Troops Withdraw from Piombino Port</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported military news: The German garrison at the port of Piombino on the northern Italian coast and the German naval artillery on the Italian mainland coast have recently withdrawn northward to avoid being encircled by the advancing enemy forces. The artillery and important facilities of the German base have been destroyed. Before withdrawing, the German garrison continuously shelled enemy artillery positions on the opposite island of Elba.</p>
<h3>Air Raid on Versailles: 700 Casualties</h3>
<p>Paris, 26th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reported: Local newspapers reported that anti-Axis aircraft bombed Versailles on Saturday morning, causing about 700 casualties, including 225 deaths. A train bound for Paris was bombed, killing many passengers. In addition, Orleans was attacked twice on the 20th and 23rd, killing 350 civilians. According to the Paris Soir, the entire city of Versailles was bombed.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Issues 1,000 Yuan Banknotes</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that Chongqing recently issued two types of banknotes, 1,000 yuan and 500 yuan, which have been circulating since the beginning of the month. However, the reasons for issuing large-denomination notes have not been specifically explained. According to Chongqing's total budget for last year, it was 3.6 trillion yuan, while revenue included only 142.4 billion yuan from customs duties, 90 billion yuan from wartime consumption tax, 212.5 billion yuan from direct tax, 37.87 billion yuan from total tax, 560 billion yuan from tobacco and alcohol tax, 37.89 billion yuan from mining tax, 341.48 billion yuan from land tax, 34 billion yuan from the new unified tax, 41.75 billion yuan from salt tax, 100.505 billion yuan from salt monopoly revenue, 68.44 billion yuan from sugar, 7.75 billion yuan from matches, and 60.01 billion yuan from cigarettes, totaling 1.10698 trillion yuan. In addition, the so-called "Victory Public Bonds" amounted to 300 billion yuan, food bonds to 639 billion yuan, and food savings bonds to 79.7 billion yuan, totaling only 2.12568 trillion yuan, still a huge shortfall of 1.514461 trillion yuan from the original expenditure budget of 3.6 trillion yuan. Therefore, it is necessary to issue large-denomination banknotes to make up for the shortfall in revenue. This is one reason. Moreover, this year's new budget is much larger than last year's, reportedly amounting to about 7 trillion yuan, making it even more necessary to issue large-denomination banknotes to support the already collapsing financial system. This is another reason. At the same time, after the Japanese army launched new operations in Henan and Hunan, Chongqing's main strongholds, Luoyang and Changsha, successively fell, and the peaceful area further expanded, leading to an increasing demand for central reserve notes. Therefore, although the reason for our government's issuance of 500 yuan notes this time is to meet the demands of silver and money merchants, on the other hand, it is also due to the needs of the new peaceful area. Conversely, Chongqing has repeatedly lost strongholds, its military base is gradually being lost, and its political position can no longer maintain public trust, resulting in higher prices and a greater shortage of materials, leading to the shaking of the entire economic foundation. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the face value of currency to balance income and expenditure. In fact, given the internal importance and difficulties, it should be understood that the issuance of these two large-denomination banknotes cannot hide the shaking of its financial foundation and the panic in the minds of the people under its rule.</p>
<p>The Central Headquarters for Promoting Wartime Food Production, established within the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, held its first joint meeting on the 13th of this month and its first advisory meeting on the 14th, actively engaging in concrete activities. On the 13th, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce announced the internal organization and system of the Central Headquarters for Promoting Wartime Food Production.

A total of all directors, supervisors, and member representatives of various trade associations attended. Competent authorities sent personnel to attend and provide guidance. Details are compiled as follows:</p>

<h3>Solemn Ceremony</h3>
<p>The presidium of the general meeting was composed of Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Guo Shun, Huang Jiangquan, and Shen Weiting. The meeting was opened with a bell, and the presidium took their seats. The entire assembly stood at attention and paid the highest respect to the national flag and the portrait of the Father of the Nation. A moment of silence was observed. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. Chairman Yuan Yangke was hospitalized, and Pei Yunqing delivered a farewell speech on his behalf, stating, "I have been in charge of this association for two years. Looking back on the past two years, it has been since the opening of the Greater East Asia War. In order to adapt to the wartime system, under the policy of "controlled economy," industry and commerce have borne the brunt of the impact, facing an unprecedentedly severe era. Therefore, in the past two years, there have been countless storms and waves. In terms of industry, there is a lack of raw materials, limitations on power, and continuous price increases, which have led to a sharp increase in wages, affecting costs and output, and leaving us in a precarious situation. In terms of commerce, the sources of goods are scarce, most commodity prices are controlled, the cost of living continues to rise, expenditures increase sharply, and inventories dwindle, causing many to worry about "sitting and eating until the mountain is empty." As for the countless difficulties faced by the industrial and commercial sectors and the unexpected events that occur from time to time, they are even more numerous. Although this association has made repeated meager efforts within its responsibilities, the results have been limited. This is partly due to environmental constraints and partly due to my own mediocre talents and lack of credibility. I have rushed about in vain, unable to alleviate the current difficulties, and I feel guilty before the gods. Fortunately, I have been assisted by all the directors and supervisors, as well as the diligent and dedicated work of all members of this association. With the understanding of our members, we have been able to barely maintain the current situation. This is what I should be grateful for and what I can be content with. In addition to the routine reports on the work of each department under the jurisdiction of this association at this year's general meeting, the proposals of the members of each industry and the proposals of this association have been carefully reviewed and offered for discussion. I hope that everyone will express their valuable opinions, promote industrial and commercial welfare, alleviate the difficulties encountered, and gather ideas for the benefit of all. Standing Director Lin Kanghou reported on general affairs, and Wang Boyuan reported on financial affairs. Regarding the budget of this association, according to the provisions of the association charter, it should be submitted to the general meeting of members for resolution and reported to the competent authorities for record. However, due to the sharp and rapid increase in various commodity prices in recent years, which have deviated from the norm, the work of preparing the budget for the assembly has also become very difficult. In order to suit the actual situation, it is proposed to prepare the budget and final accounts simultaneously at the end of the fiscal year, submit them to the board of directors for approval, send them to the board of supervisors for review, and then submit them to the general meeting of members for ratification and report them to the competent authorities for record. Shen Weiting reported on guidance, Wang Boyuan reported on commerce on behalf of Ye Fuzhi, and Guo Shun reported on investigations. Officials delivered speeches, with Lai Jingming and Huang Xianggu representing the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Social Welfare, respectively.</p>
<h3>Discussion Proposals</h3>
<p>The discussion proposals were presided over by Lin Kanghou: 5 proposals to strengthen the association and its affiliated trade associations; 3 proposals to improve the grain administration control system; 1 proposal that inspections of weights and measures should be leniently punished; 1 proposal to thoroughly liberalize the free trade of secondary commodities; 1 proposal to fairly allocate special industrial and commercial raw materials; (omitted); 3 proposals to revise the articles of association; 4 proposals to strengthen the organization and develop the affairs of the association; 1 proposal on how to eliminate obstacles and dredge the sources of materials, as transportation and traffic are the lifeblood of commerce, to benefit commerce; 1 proposal on how to increase the electricity consumption for important industrial use to benefit production; the price limits set by the authorities are not only inconsistent with reality in terms of high and low levels, but also the approval period is indefinitely extended, often the time when the first price limit is announced is the preparation period for the second and third price limits, causing great suffering to merchants and people, 1 proposal on how to improve the situation to alleviate the difficulties of merchants; 1 proposal that the Shanxi Road Bridge and Fujian Road Bridge on the Suzhou River have not yet been opened, affecting the commerce of the northern district, and it is proposed to petition the authorities to open them immediately to prosper the market; 1 proposal to petition the economic and administrative authorities to restrict the prices of raw materials, and to stipulate a time limit for the application and evaluation of manufactured products, so as to avoid affecting the difficulty of manufacturers' reproduction and maintain industry; 1 proposal to levy a 4% wartime consumption special tax on embroidery products, as ordinary goods, exempt from the list of luxury goods, in order to maintain production; 1 proposal that Article 13 of the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations should delete the restriction of "major commodities", so that industries that deal with major commodities can also follow the example of strengthening trade associations; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the financial authorities to unify the business tax collection methods in various districts of the city, "Since the city has recovered the concessions, the amount of business tax is inconsistent, resulting in the need to levy taxes in districts such as Nanshi and Zhabei, while those that can be exempted are districts such as District 1 and the old eight districts, so that merchants and people do not know what to do," in order to eliminate disputes and unify the tax policy; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the Ministry of Finance to exempt the Shanghai yarn and cloth industry from the profit-seeking enterprise income tax for the 32nd year of the Republic of China; 1 proposal to request the transfer to the government to promote handicrafts to meet the needs of the people, and to give special protection to the hand-woven industry, a total of 18 proposals, all of which were resolved by the general assembly, and detailed cases will be published separately.</p>
<h3>Election by Drawing Lots</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Wu Zuyou, the representative of the competent authority, drew lots, and the remaining directors were Yuan Ludeng, Qin Runqing, Jin Zongcheng, Xiao Yicheng, Wang Renqing, Wei Shanfu, Pan Xusheng, Zhang Lianfang, Shen Weiya, Niu Zhizi, and Xie Meisheng, a total of 11 people. The remaining supervisors were Lin Kanghou, Wen Ting, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zhongnan, Wu Dingming, and Wang Housheng, a total of 6 people. Then, the directors and supervisors were re-elected. As a result, Shen Weiting, Xi Rungeng, Xie Xiaochu, Chen Panjun, He Wuliang, Yang Guanqi, Cen Zhiliang, Dai Zibin, Li Gengyang, and Shen Kunquan, 10 people, were elected as directors, and Pei Yunqing, Guo Shun, Wang Boyuan, Jiang Shangda, and Qian Zongfan, 5 people, were elected as supervisors, and 7 alternate directors and 4 supervisors were elected.</p>
<p>Then, Wen Lantong delivered the closing speech, roughly saying, "It has been two years since the establishment of the association. This is the second annual meeting, and it is also the time for the directors and supervisors to draw lots to re-elect half of them. The meaning of today's meeting is very important. Fortunately, we have received guidance and encouragement from all the esteemed guests, and we are deeply grateful. It is especially gratifying to see all the members attending enthusiastically and gathering together. I hope that in the future, all the affairs of the association must pay attention to the instructions of the superiors and work hard to live up to everyone's expectations. It is expected that after this increase in new life, there will be more progress at next year's annual meeting," and so on. Finally, a group photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned at 8 o'clock.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Major Battle of the Mariana Islands - Broadcast Speech by Director Osaka of the Continental News</h3>
<p>Director Yoichi Osako of the Continental News delivered a broadcast speech on the Mariana Islands operation at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station at 9 pm on the 25th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<h3>Clumsy Tactics Will Inevitably Lead to Failure</h3>
<p>I would like to briefly state my thoughts on the major battle situation in the Mariana Islands, which is currently in fierce fighting. Observing the current battle situation with a cold eye, I can assert that "the enemy America has already been defeated." In all military operations, it is most clumsy to divide one's own strength against the enemy into two. The reason for the failure is rooted in this. For example, the enemy America has poured most of its forces into the second front in Europe, and then concentrated the remaining forces on the Pacific front, which is this kind of situation. The reason why the enemy America took this reckless move must be that they underestimated the Japanese air power in the Inner South Seas. Considering the attack on Saipan, it was a major gamble. The enemy believed that once Saipan was attacked, the Japanese army would definitely come out to fight, and they could destroy them in one fell swoop and resolve the Pacific War. Moreover, if they could seize Saipan, the distance to Tokyo could be reduced to 1,268 nautical miles, and the distance to the Philippines could be reduced to 1,500 nautical miles. Then, with the B29 bomber, they could bomb Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, the Philippines, and other places, all under the control of the air. Once the air supremacy in the Western Pacific is secured, and then the sea supremacy is grasped, the connection between Japan and the South Seas can be cut off.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Obtained Unprecedented Results</h3>
<p>The enemy America, with most of the Pacific Fleet, consisting of more than 20 aircraft carriers and more than 10 battleships, led more than 100 transport ships, and began attacking Saipan on the 11th. The attacks were repeatedly unsuccessful until the 15th, when the third landing operation was successfully carried out, and about two divisions of troops were deployed to land successfully, and fleets were dispatched to surround them from all sides. In addition to bombing with carrier-based aircraft, they also used naval guns to bombard. The Imperial Navy had anticipated this action of the enemy long ago, and had been secretly preparing for it, waiting for the opportunity to annihilate the enemy. As a result, from the 12th to the 18th, our air force carried out fierce battles, and from the 19th to the 20th, part of our combined fleet launched a dignified attack. On the 23rd, the air force was even more active, and a total of 4 battleships, more than 11 aircraft carriers, 6 cruisers, 1 destroyer, 1 warship of unknown type, and 1 submarine were sunk or damaged, 6 transport ships were sunk or damaged, and more than 400 aircraft were shot down or damaged. This was the greatest victory since Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Although it has not been possible to obtain a decisive victory over the entire mobile force dispatched by the enemy, it can be asserted that the enemy has already begun to carry out evasive operations outside the bombing range of the aircraft.</p>
<h3>Remote Logistics Base, Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>The nature of modern naval warfare is completely different from the naval battle of the Sea of Japan in previous years. Due to the advancement of fleet equipment, the increase in the radius of action after the development of aircraft, and the expansion of the battlefield, the operations are becoming increasingly difficult. For example, the occupation of the sea and space has become meaningless. Only by directly destroying the enemy or destroying the enemy's air base and destroying the enemy's air power is it a necessary condition. Moreover, the two sides are hundreds of nautical miles apart, and they are launching search operations day and night. From this, it can be seen that modern warfare is complex and profound, and it is by no means as simple as ordinary people imagine. Therefore, it is impossible to seek a great victory without any damage to oneself. In this battle, our side also lost one aircraft carrier, two auxiliary oil tankers, and 50 aircraft. This battle has the greatest and most important character since the outbreak of the war. The importance of the wartime logistics line is self-evident, but the enemy America's closest logistics base, the Marshall Islands, is also more than 1,000 nautical miles away. Such a remote logistics line is unprecedented, and the difficulty is naturally in mind. On the contrary, our side can be supplied continuously from the country through the Ogasawara Islands, which is extremely convenient. By waiting for work at ease, the enemy army can be annihilated.</p>
<h3>Wallace's Trip to Chongqing Aims to Strengthen Pressure on Chongqing - Statement by Minister Matsudaira</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Allied Japanese Embassy held a regular press conference for Chinese journalists from the city at the Huamao Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, at 2 pm yesterday (26th). The embassy was attended by Minister of Information Matsudaira, Vice Consul Fukuma, and others. Minister Matsudaira gave a detailed account of the purpose of US Vice President Wallace's trip to Chongqing. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Purpose of Trip to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Minister of Information Matsudaira first said: US Vice President Wallace, after arriving in Chongqing on the 20th of this month, held four or five talks with Chiang Kai-shek. On the 24th, he even issued a simple joint statement, which stated in detail: "The two sides have completely identical views on basic principles and objectives, and at the same time reaffirmed mutual assistance in the war against Japan," and so on. Mr. Matsudaira said: According to the information he obtained, the purpose of Wallace's trip to Chongqing was to try to prevent the tendency of nationalism from occurring within the Chongqing regime, and at the same time prevent Chongqing from resuming its movements in East Asia. Recently, the British and American media have fiercely attacked Chiang Kai-shek's "China's Destiny," believing that it has reactionary and xenophobic ideas. In addition, the Five-Five Constitution of Chongqing has also been severely attacked as not being democratic, and they have also instigated reporters stationed in Chongqing to demand so-called freedom of speech. This is the means used by Britain and the United States to prevent Chongqing from becoming self-aware.</p>
<h3>Oppressing Chongqing</h3>
<p>Minister Matsudaira also said: Recently, when Chongqing and the Communist Party of China abolished the army, Chongqing frankly resolved the Communist Party as a party fighting for political power. Britain and the United States regarded Chongqing's attitude towards the Communist Party as reactionary and totalitarian, and oppressed Chongqing to make concessions to the Communist Party. After the Cairo Conference, Chongqing had a considerable atmosphere of excitement, but after March of this year, due to the soaring prices in Chongqing, especially the shortage of food, and externally, because Japan preemptively launched operations on the Indian-Burmese border, causing the intensification of the Indian independence movement, and the operations in Henan Province, the unexpectedly rapid progress of the Japanese army aroused anxiety among the Chongqing military, government, and people, and there was a hope of returning to East Asia. Therefore, the United States immediately dispatched Wallace to try to prevent it. Finally, Mr. Matsudaira said that according to our observations, the United States will demand more from Chongqing in the future, and the pressure from Japan will become more widespread. In the future, all the actions of Chongqing's top leaders will be forced to follow the instructions of the United States, and Chongqing's hope of self-awareness will become narrower. This is not only harmful to the development of Greater East Asia, but also useless. In order to thoroughly eliminate the opium and refresh the appearance of the city, a Drug and Gambling Investigation Section has been specially set up in the judicial department, and excellent police officers have been selected to take on the investigation work. It will be officially established on July 1st to start work and severely investigate the crimes of manufacturing and selling opium and drugs.</p>
<h3>Household Registration Section Reassigned to the Baojia Section</h3>
<p>The household registration section originally established in the administrative office of the First Police Bureau of the city has recently been ordered to be abolished. The original household registration work is now handled by the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, which is taken over by the Second Section under the jurisdiction of the office. After thorough investigation, it was found that Yang Chuan and others' job-related behavior of accepting bribes</p>
<h3>Was Truly Illegal</h3>
<p>The inspector-general, Weng Changxi, who was in a supervisory position, failed to fulfill his duties in investigating the case, but instead acted as a bribe-giver, and is also suspected of dereliction of duty. He should be dismissed from his post, and the fugitive Jiang Zhenzhou should be investigated. The investigation of the above-mentioned criminals has now been completed, and they have been handed over to the local procuratorate for interrogation, and then to the local court for investigation and punishment according to law.</p>
<h3>Police Officers of Huashan Road Sub-Bureau Prosecuted According to Law for Dereliction of Duty and Accepting Bribes</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Yang Peisheng, director of the judicial division of the Huashan Road Sub-Bureau of the First Police Bureau of the city, investigator Fu Xiaofu, and inspector-general Weng Changxi, and others accepting bribes and dereliction of duty, a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday made a special visit to the director of the bureau, Li Shiyu, who explained in detail the process of the bribery and dereliction of duty case: When the city's household rice was distributed by the Huazhong Rice Allocation Association, it was first weighed by the Maritime Affairs Office to show fairness. However, the staff</p>
<h3>Secretly Engaged in Malpractice</h3>
<p>Reduced the number of catties weighed, reported more than less, filled in the weighing list, and sold the embezzled amount at black market prices to make profits. The incident was detected by Yang Peisheng, director of the judicial division of the Huashan Road Sub-Bureau, and others, who arrested Qi Weiyuan and other seven staff members of the weighing department of the Maritime Affairs Office. After interrogation, they were found guilty of embezzlement in their work, and were sent to the procuratorate for review in mid-May. When Yang Peisheng and the handling investigator Fu Xiaofu were handling the case, they planned to go to Yangshupu first to arrest a few rice merchants, saying that they were suspected of</p>
<h3>Buying Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>And falsely accused the district chief of the rice industry, Lu Jingwu, that they would continue to arrest other colleagues, spreading the word outside. The rice merchants were panicked and went to Yang Chuan to dredge the relationship, hoping to avoid investigation. At that time, Chuan Xiaofu and Jiang Zhenzhou, the eye line in the case who was at large, were specially responsible for contacting the rice merchants. 16 companies including Yuantai Rice Store handed over 160,000 yuan to Chuan, and 30 companies including Dayoukang handed over 300,000 yuan to Yang, and 9 companies including Sanyang handed over 130,000 yuan to Jiang, a total of 590,000 yuan. Except for the expenses for the eye line Jiang for opening up the room and meals at the Dongfang Hotel when contacting, and the refund of 160,000 yuan to the rice merchants, the remaining 270,000 yuan,</p>
<p>Has been transferred out. When Yang and Fu were handling the case, the Shanghai Office of the Inspectorate became aware of it, and Chuan presented a 150,000 yuan promissory note from Juxingcheng Bank to Weng Changxi, the inspector-general of the district, to dredge the relationship, hoping to make up for the settlement. Weng showed the ticket to Saito Tadashi, a Japanese inspector, who refused and ordered him to return it immediately. Weng returned the original ticket after two or three days, and sent Zhang Rou, a member of the interrogation section, and Huang Erchang, the detective chief of the investigation section, to Saito Tadashi of the Inspectorate</p>
<h3>Electric Tram Service Restored in District 1</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Tram Company, in order to care for the difficult life of its employees, has promised to provide great guarantees to all employees, and in order to facilitate the transportation of citizens, it has managed to restore the operation of routes 1, 2, 7, and 8 and the four main lines yesterday afternoon (26th). Most of the employees, after understanding the company's sincerity and considering the inconvenience of transportation for all citizens, have returned to the factory to serve. The company's Beikai Road Factory, Jing'an Temple Road Depot, Huishan Depot, Jiading Road Station, Jing'an Temple Station, etc., all posted notices, roughly saying: "Our company has given all employees great guarantees. The result of the operation on this (26th) day shows that there is no difficulty or uneasiness at all. Therefore, the scheduled trains will be operated as usual tomorrow (27th) morning. Please go to the depot as usual to serve. Please do not delay," etc. The company is very sorry for the inconvenience caused to the citizens by this strike, and sincerely hopes that all employees will return to work immediately and continue to serve, restore the entire line, and facilitate the citizens.</p>
<h3>Residents of Military-Managed Apartments Extended Their Eviction Date</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the evacuation of residents from military-managed apartments, according to reliable sources, it is now known that the military-managed apartments will be rented by military families in the future, while the original rented residents will move into the residences of British and American expatriates in Shanghai. The original plan was for all residents of the apartments under military management to evacuate before the 15th of this month, but because some of the British and American expatriates have not yet moved into the concentration camps, it has been decided to reschedule the evacuation to early July. It is also heard that the British and American expatriates who have not yet entered the concentration camps will all be transferred to the concentration camps by the end of this month.</p>
<h3>Li Xianglan Hosts Cultural Figures</h3>

<h3>National Forum: Suggesting Various Guilds Establish Scholarship Funds for Children of Workers</h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>In the past month, due to the abnormal fluctuations in rice prices, all levels of society have been greatly affected, especially the matter of tuition fees for the next semester, which is the most serious. If only a slight increase is made, schools will naturally have difficulties maintaining operations. However, if the increase is too large (such as the rumored tuition fee conversion to rice policy), parents will be even more helpless and at a loss.</p>
<p>The so-called parents are mostly salaried employees. Their monthly income, when stretched to support a family of eight, will leave them with hardly enough to eat. Even maintaining personal life is difficult. Although the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers have measures such as scholarships and student loans, they are like a small amount of porridge for many monks, ultimately difficult to universalize. Looking back at various industries, except for a very few exceptions, the rest have substantial financial resources. Taking the hardware, foreign goods, and new medicine industries as examples, they have received special favors over the years, becoming the darlings of big business, with asset values soaring. If each guild could raise millions or tens of millions of yuan from its members to serve as scholarship funds for the children of workers, it would be easy and achievable in one fell swoop. I believe that the directors and supervisors of various trade guilds are all outstanding individuals, renowned in their time, and admired by people from all walks of life. They should have keen insight and make this grand aspiration, opening up a path for the children of ordinary workers to continue their education, indirectly sharing some of the national responsibilities, and also creating blessings for their own descendants.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that the Egg Industry and Thermos Bottle Industry guilds have both started to handle scholarship matters for the children of workers, and the Changzhou Fellow Association and others have also declared their continued efforts to run scholarship funds. It is believed that other industry guilds and fellow associations have strengths no less than those listed above, so why worry about not being able to catch up quickly and stand shoulder to shoulder with them?</p>
<p>However, if various industry guilds or fellow associations believe that there is no problem with providing funds, they may entrust the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers to handle the administrative aspects, in order to achieve efficient results. I believe that the authorities of both newspapers have always regarded nurturing talents as their own responsibility and will certainly not refuse.</p>

<h3>Naval Painters (8): The Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>"Principal Kawaide and Mr. Ogata both saw you when you entered the school in Kagoshima."</p>
<p>Masato said this while starting to peel the skin of a preserved fruit.</p>
<p>"Oh, are the teachers both well?"</p>
<p>Tadao also thought of his alma mater and felt a surge of infinite emotion.</p>
<p>"They are both safe and sound. Mr. Ogata likes cigarettes very much, so I gave him three boxes of 'Hope' brand cigarettes. He was very happy. Those cigarettes are very hard to get these days."</p>
<p>"He likes cigarettes and also likes sake."</p>
<p>"Yes, there are very few teachers as memorable as him. Also, a memorial monument for the fallen soldiers has been erected on the second middle school's parade ground, did you know?"</p>
<p>"I didn't know that."</p>
<p>"A very solemn monument has been erected in front of the east side of the school building. The names of the alumni who died in action from the September 18th Incident to the July 7th Incident are engraved on the monument. My older brother's name is also on it."</p>
<p>"So, Shinichiro died in action. When I saw it in the Kagoshima newspaper, I was filled with regret!"</p>
<p>"Yes, in the end, my brother died before me."</p>
<p>Masato said this slowly and calmly.</p>
<p>"You are also a soldier, you might be listed on the memorial monument for the fallen soldiers at some point."</p>
<p>"…"</p>
<p>Masato looked down and smiled slightly, using a fork to spear a persimmon.</p>
<p>"Speaking of this, even if I dedicate my life to painting warships, I won't be listed on the memorial monument for the fallen soldiers. Thinking about that makes me really depressed!"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't think about these things. Whether it's you or me, as Japanese citizens, we are no different. If you think that only soldiers can enjoy fame, I think that's wrong."</p>
<p>These words were spoken in a low voice, but with great strength. Tadao was silent for a moment.</p>
<p>"Well then, let's go!"</p>
<p>Masato called the waiter to settle the bill. Tadao hurriedly stopped him, saying that Tokyo was his home and he should naturally be the host, but Masato smiled and said:</p>
<p>"I've already received my salary. Aren't you still relying on your family to make a living?"</p>
<p>As soon as Tadao heard these words, he stopped arguing about paying and just scratched the top of his head.</p>
<p>Although the two of them left the restaurant, neither of them wanted to part ways. At the same time, neither of them was the type of person who could drink continuously.</p>
<p>"There are still many things I want to say and hear. Masato, do you have to return to Yokosuka?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, but lately I've gotten used to sleeping on the ship, and I feel very comfortable."</p>
<p>"Well then, why don't you come stay at my apartment for the night? Although it's a simple and uncomfortable room…"</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter. Okay, I'll bother you for one night!" Masato readily agreed. (107)</p>
<h3>Midwifery Movement: Our Services No. 5</h3>
<p>Poor pregnant women can apply to this office for midwifery services one month before delivery.</p>
<p>For normal deliveries, a midwife will be dispatched to assist during childbirth. If there are difficult labor situations, hospitalization will be approved, and all expenses will be borne by this office.</p>
<p>The midwifery movement has the utmost purpose of protecting mothers and babies. We hope that all sectors of society will actively donate.</p>
<p>Gratitude to Nanyang Hospital: I was previously introduced by your column to Nanyang Hospital for a free lung examination and was found to have pulmonary tuberculosis, requiring hospitalization for treatment. However, I am a poor and weak teacher, how could I afford the huge medical expenses? Fortunately, the hospital president generously agreed to free hospitalization and administered artificial pneumothorax and medication. I was admitted to the hospital on the 2nd of this month and discharged on the 17th. During that time, I received careful treatment from Dr. Ding, the director of the Department of Tuberculosis, and my condition improved day by day. Moreover, the wards were clean and bright, and the nurses provided attentive service, which made the patients feel infinitely comforted! Recalling the sincerity of your introduction and the kindness of the hospital, I specially write this letter to express my gratitude and will never forget it. Sincerely, Wu Xuehai.</p>
