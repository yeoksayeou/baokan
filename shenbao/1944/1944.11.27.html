<h3>黨不可分國必統一　六中執委臨時會發表宣言</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　中國國民黨日昨舉行第六屆中央執行委員會臨時全體會議，大會最後議決爲汪主席逝世發表宜言，茲誌原詞如次：</p>
<p>「中國國民黨中央執行委員會，爲汪主席逝世宣言」</p>
<p>勇往直前　完成遺志</p>
<p>民國十四年革命基礎甫經確立，革命勢力未越兩廣之時，不幸國父孫先生棄同志而長逝。今者國步之艱難，時局之嚴重，還過於十四年，又不幸主席汪先生於此時亦棄同志而長逝，此誠本黨歷史上之厄運，而全體同志所爲維心泣血者也。國父逝世，予同志以莫大之悲傷，哀兵奮赴，全國景從，因之而有十五年以至於十七年北伐之成功。汪先生逝世，全黨同志亦自應運其悲傷痛悼之情，發爲慷慨赴義之勇，苦其心志，勞其筋骨，以完成在先生未竟之志，則建國之大任，正爲後死者所當負，而革命前途之光輝，或且較北伐時代而過之。</p>
<p>建設三民主義國家</p>
<p>國父在遺囑中詔示國人，一則日一求中國之自由平等」再則日一取消不平等條約」。數年來本黨同志在在先生領導之下，上下一心，努力於此神聖目的之實現。自去年一月對英美宣戰，及與日本締結同盟條約以來，英美所加於中國之不平等條約，掃蕩無遺，共同作戰之日本，復自動放棄浩外法權，交還租界，取消辛丑條約之駐兵權，並約定全面和平成功，日軍即行全部撤退，是國父遺留與吾人之責任，吾黨同志已在汪先生領導之下，次第完成。此吾黨同志可以上慰國父在天之靈，且可以下州　於國人者也。惟國父最終之目的，在建設三民主義之新中國，今全面和平尚未成功，世界戰爭將臨最後決戰之階段，中華民族之地位，旣處於戰爭激流之中，則民權之發揚，民生之改善，目亦無從急進，是革命之自的未貫徹，而建國之理想未完成，吾黨同志應如何一心一德，衆志成城，以努力廊淸三民主義實現之陣碍，而建設民有民治民享之新中國也。</p>
<p>反共政策　寗渝相同</p>
<p>本黨同志不幸因一時主張之異同，致有南京重慶之分立，因之國家未能統一，步伐未能一致，此蓋無可　　之事實，而本黨對於國民尤深內疚。六全大會以遠，五更寒暑，吾人對同一主義鳴同一歷史，同一運命之同志，雖兩地相隔，實無日不在懷念之中。在渝同志之艱苦掙扎，吾人固極其諒解，至其內心上隱痛，以及吾人之艱危，尤爲吾人具有深刻之同情與無限之憤慨者也。同志無諭在寗在渝，所受共產黨徒之脅迫，以及所遭遇之困難，彼此不止相同，抑有彼甚於此者。吾人於還都之初，首揭反共之旗，勵行反共之實。在渝同志則受環境之牽制，行動未能自由，略加制裁，則受破壞共同戰綫之責難，推誠相與，則彼隂行篡奪政權，刧掠軍備，以　食之勢，而遂其鯨吞之慾，使人手足無措，進退兩難。反共爲本黨之基本政策，反共爲本黨之一貫精神，今因時勢之推移，竟受共黨之刦持。處此環境，此吾人之所以深表同情，而深爲憤慨者也。本黨同志一時之主張雖異，根本之用心則同，反共救國同志之在南京而此志不渝，同志之在重慶者，此志當亦不渝。時地雖異，初衷莫異，此本黨同志人人所可自信而互信者。</p>
<p>脫離英美實現和平</p>
<p>在寗同志與日本合作，而在渝同志則受英美刦持，此亦無可諱言之事實，而爲國家最不幸之現象也。本黨與英美帝國主義者相搏團，以圖脫離不平等條約之束縛，實爲六十年來之一貫的革命主張。國父遺訓，尤對吾輩反覆詔示。南京同志去年對英美宣戰之際，本黨之傳統政策，得以實現，英美在華之勢力，得以　除。百年之宿敵旣除，中國之自由斯得，此實本黨於完成北伐偉業後所成就之神聖事業也。然而英美在重慶之侵略政策，則變末加厲，勾結共黨干涉內政，陽藉援助之名，隂謀控制之實，光以革命的中國國民黨同志日夜受彼先天的敵人之脅迫，其內心上之痛苦與悔恨，寗復待言。吾人確信重慶同志，終有一日起而解脫英美之桎梏，而與吾人相携手，以獲得全面之和平。彼帝國主義者或詆中日同盟條約爲紙上空文，殊不知世界大局演變至此，日本國民及政府無論於道義與利害，斷不容復以中國爲敵，一旦全面和平成立，則日本之撤兵，於理於勢，均無可疑，雖有智慧，不如乘勢，重慶同志，當已庫之熟矣。</p>
<p>團結一致　再建中國</p>
<p>黨不可分，國必統一，汪先生於離開重慶之日，即已昭示同志，官告國人，六年以來，吾人艱苦卓絕之奮鬥，胥以此爲目標，全黨同志不分寗渝，不分和戰，對此精誠，先宜共諒。今者汪先生乘吾人而長逝矣，吾人不憂共黨之不可撲滅，惟恐本黨同志之不能團結，不憂帝國主義侵略政策之不可抗，惟恐革命勞力之日就渙散。吾人確信六年以來，汪先生所領導之和平運動，已獲有偉大之效果，奠定堅强之基礎，此後之成敗利鈍，惟視同志之能否努力。回溯二十年前，以彈丸之廣州，不數年間而統一全國，撫今追昔，則此後時勢之擴展，祗有前進，不容猶疑。吾人今日亟應淬勵奮發，圑結一致，與共產黨及帝國主義相　門，再建中國，統一本黨，萬不可懷茍安之望，存依賴之心。夫時局之艱危，無有過於今日，惟有鬥爭，足以生存，惟有自助，方得天助，願我黨全體同志與全國人民共勉之。</p>
<p>社評</p>
<h3>頭山精神</h3>
<p>昨日我們在悽風苦雨中追悼「中國革命之友」頭山滿翁，我們爲什麼要迫悼他？追悼他的意義和值得我們追悼的地方，在一悼頭山滿先生」一文中，已有論述。但是，在追悼之後，想起了我們國家，更想到了我們目前的政治，感觸甚深，愈益覺得頭山滿翁精神的可貴和可敬！更有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>自從汪主席逝世後，「國民政府似失柱石，其前途或將更多困難」。（見十三日本報近衛公談話）第一在領導上，現在已有陳公博先生繼承。陳先生對於汪先生生前謀國之忠，治事之勤，以至道志何在，均有深刻的認識，也是最能實行者，全國上下，一致擁戴。同時，利用這次地方官員在京之便，召開全國軍政會議，會議的中心，檢討過去，改進將來，使政府與人民打成一片，以强化政治軍事力量，協助大東亞戰爭。這次會議的重要性，誠如盟邦松井總參謀長說：「汪主席逝世後，可說左右中國之前途，全恃在這次會議」。而這次會議，首先感到欣慰的是陳代主席在開幕訓詞中能嚴正坦白的檢討過去政治上的弊病。這點可以告訴大家，領導上的困難，不用我們去多担心了，所担心的，這次會議的決議案，能否實事求是的澈底實現。這就是我們談頭山翁的精神的動機。</p>
<p>頭山翁的精神，最大的表現在愛國思想和民族主義兩方面。他在二十一歲時候，就從事於愛國運動。在故鄉福岡縣，紏合同志，組玄洋社，以修脅知識，鍛鍊身體爲宗旨，期能有事之秋，獻身國家，在其門下，人材輩出，當甲午，日俄戰爭時，活動甚力。後來發行福頌新報，主倡大亞洲主義，從事實踐指導，一生奔走國事，厥功甚偉。但是到死時一直無冠無位。在他一生的成就上講，是日本國家主義運動創造者；一般社會力的團結者；大亞洲主義的宣揚者。從他一生的活動中，去瞭解他愛國思想有三個特點：第一，始終如一的實踐愛國運動，不餒不息；第二，組織社圑，團結同志，爲國家培養人材；第三，沒有利綠觀念，盡忠於國家。這是頭山翁愛國精神的基礎。</p>
<p>一個愛國主義者，祗照顧自己的國家利益，和民族的發展，結果必然陷於狹隘的愛國主義者。頭山翁很能認識了這點，倡道大亞洲主義，並且在中日關係上喊出：「日本與中國是一而一的國家」。我們國父自倫敦蒙難後，東渡日本，即與翁相往來，嗣同盟會成立於東京，翁盡力贊助。及辛亥起義成功，國父自海外歸，翁亟走滬上迎之。凡我國志士，赴日謁翁者，殆無不聆其教言，受其指導。中國是東亞共榮圈內第二個力量，所以國父說：「無日本，即無中國，無中國，即無日本」。顯山翁對中國革命傾「誠」贊助，是由於愛日本，所以愛中國，以至於愛東亞，決沒有利用中國的心。這是他澈底理解了中日合作的眞諦，才能有精誠的睦鄰善友精神。</p>
<p>頭山翁精神的偉大，已如上述，但是他的成功，是在於他有「毅力」和「決心」。今天我們的國家，須要我們的爲政者和人民，都能有正確的愛國思想，純正的民族主義，同時培養我們的毅力和決心，來擔當救國的重任，來督導政治上軌道，以頭山翁的精神做榜樣。</p>
<p>最後，陳代主席在全國軍政會議訓詞中說：「今日我們所缺乏的，不是理論，不是政策，所缺乏的只是毅力，只是決心」。眞是一針見血的話，過去政治上所犯的毛病，都找出它的根源。今後要對症下藥，因此願望政府拿出「毅力」「決心」，對政治上的痼疾，施行開刀手術、首先在行政設施上看到頭山翁的精神。</p>
<h3>呂宋島東方海面　敵艦五艘被擊沉</h3>

<h3>南寗陷落經過</h3>
<p>華南綫基地二十六日中央社電　南寗乃華南方面駐渝美空軍最後基地，已於二十四日被日軍攻陷。此次南寗作戰，係自十九日開始，攻擊僅五日間，即自貴縣攻抵相距二百公里之南寗，進擊之迅速，實打破以往所有記錄。當日軍於十月十二日佔價桂平時，渝軍即已料定日軍必進攻南寗，常即調桂林柳州附近之廣西軍四十六·十四·二十一各軍雨下，下午貴縣附近之廣東軍三十五集圑軍之三個師，亦以十二師兵力企圖奪回桂平·丹竹·平南·同時並努力肌止日軍進攻南寗。反之，日軍則於桂平西南方山岳地帶，當即突入貴縣。將其退路遮斷，渝軍九師團動搖，而自南寗向北方之宜山，都安·降山·方面撤退·自此於貴縣方面待機之日軍部隊，認爲戰機已熱，　沿貴寗公路而進，開始進攻。二十一日午後佔領南寗之前衛賓陽，並於南寗東北部山岳地帶，擊潰廣西保安隊約一千名，二十四日晨經與進抵賓陽北方之日軍取得通　後，上午九時，終於突入南寗市街，於市內展開掃蕩戰，並攻入該市西方之飛機塲，而將之完金佔領云。</p>
<h3>全國軍政會議　昨圓滿閉幕　各問題均討論竣事</h3>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　昨（二十六）日上午九時，全國軍政會議賡續舉行第四次懇談會。出席陳行政院長兼軍委會委員長，周副院長兼副委員長以次等六十餘人。首由陳委員長致訓詞，繼由鮑總參謀長·葉陸軍部長·何經理總監·陳義參事代表，分別解答第三次懇談會所討論諸般問題。繼即由江蘇省長兼駐蘇州綏靖主任任援道浙江省長　駐杭州綏靖主任項致莊，警衛第一師師長劉啓雄，警衛第二師師長秦漢消，警衛第三師師長鍾健魂等，分別報告各該防地軍政現况。十一時正，暫行休息，二十分鐘後，仍縱續討論第三次懇談。會議席上軍委會·陸軍部·政治部·經理總監部等所提出之諸問題，均經一一討諭竣事，直迄下午一時正，全國軍政會議乃告圓滿閉幕</p>
<p>軍政統一終必實現</p>
<p>南京二十六日中央社電　全國軍政會議自本月二十四日揭幕，經三日之開誠協議，詳密研討，已於二十六日下午圓滿閉幕。此次會議，適於汪故主席安葬之翌日召開，各長官於萬分悲悼之餘，益感責任重大。故會議空氣極爲緊張肅穆。陳行政院長兼軍委會委員長，更自始至終，親臨主持，剴切訓示，尤使出席各長官益加振奮。會議結果，對今後中央與地方間，暨地方與地方間軍政一體化問題，已有切實而具體之決定。際此全國上下正爲汪故主席逝世而同深哀悼之時，旣得陳代主席繼起領導，奉行遺志於先。復有此次全國軍政會議之召開，吾人確信各地方長官，定能仰體主席遺訓，遵照大會決定，排除困難，强化中樞地方軍政一元體制，以確保治安，增加生產爲目標，勇往前進，則民生安定，國力愈强，興華保亞大業，早日完成，並期必實現汪故主席之遺志也。</p>
<h3>亞琛區美軍　付重大代價</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊，德軍事發言人稱：亞琛區第三次大戰，將達於頂點，大部份艾森霍華將軍之軍隊，已死於戰塲，艾氏不得已調用其在比國之坦克車及步兵後備，可見德軍消耗戰之價值。在亞琛區第三次大戰之第一個回合，德軍防守已告成功，大戰十日中之槪要如左：（一）美軍僅在兩點突破德軍主要防綫，深十一公里。（二）據德方估計，奪獲每一公里之土地，美軍死亡三千名以上。（三）亞琛區美軍每方公里所消耗之砲彈，多於克恩前棧。</p>
<h3>愛境德軍全撤</h3>
<p>柏林二十六日中央社電　海通社訊：史伏勃半島之德軍業已撤退完畢，至此德軍始完全退出愛沙尼亞境，德軍之牽制戰術，在戰略上具有重大意義。蘇軍出動四倍於原所計劃之兵力，而所得僅此而已，總計被牽制於柯蘭之蘇軍達八軍團之衆。</p>

<p>鮑斯主席　闡明決意</p>

<p>追悼會主席聞蘭亭悼詞：「諸位來賓，今天上海中日各界舉行頭山翁追悼會，諸位熱烈參加，想必共同感覺心頭上籠軍一層哀傷的情緒，對這位東亞巨人敬致悼念。頭山翁一生的事業都是有功於社會國家，同時有功於隣邦以至於東亞，對於中國的革命運動，翊贊尤力，所以我們站在中國人的立塲，更加追念不已。頭山翁的特點，是胆略過人識見遠大，意志堅毅，氣魄磅礴，這些特點就是建功立業成爲東亞巨人的因素，可是頭山翁雖然貢獻國家社會的功績很大，而他始終未入仕途，畢生以人民地位，在野之身，協力政府，這更是難能可貴的，我們站在民間的立塲，更加肅敬與仰慕。今天我們追悼頭山先生，應該效法先生的精神，仰慕先生的事蹟，特別對於先生的遠大識見，發揚光大，作爲中日協力的張本。其次我個人對於先生的景仰，已在今天（二十六）由報的追悼特刋上寫了一篇短文，略有表示，這裏不贊了。」</p>

<p>略謂：「今日蒙中國方面各機關社團代表名流發起舉行如是盛大嚴肅之頭山翁追悼會，且由中日各界代表名流參加，本人先以日本一員之資格，深致謝忱，同時向中國方面之籌備委員表示鄭重感謝。頭山翁家族本擬由日本東京來滬參加，此次參悼會並向各位致謝，惟因事不克如期來滬，臨時由本人代表向諸位敬致感謝之意，本人亦必須將諸位今日之熱情，傅達頭山翁家族，以留永久試謝。」</p>

<h3>追悼頭山翁席上　中日民間代表致詞　中國民間代表　陳中孚先生悼詞</h3>
<p>今日是中國民間與在上海日本居留民民間，發起爲頭山滿先生開追悼會，追悼鄰邦巨人頭山滿先生，頭山滿先生，生於福岡縣，福岡縣人素來多出慷慨憂國之士，贊助吾國革命同志特別較多，其他日本各地，各縣，均有贊助革命同志，尤其是頭山滿先生，在明治維新之際，爲民間勤王領袖，預有大力，到明治維新成功的時候，許多同志，友人，多往政府就官職，其時頭山滿先生，雖然桃李已滿天下，而立志不入公門，不受官職，七八十年如一日，仍屹然站在民間奮鬥國事，其志堅決，不動如山，人格非常偉大，吾國人聽到，頭山滿先生，堅決意志，無不正襟欽偑而仰慕。</p>
<p>與孫總理志同道合</p>
<p>適中國自吾黨總理中山先生，提倡中國革命，初次到日本，並在同盟會成立之前，即到福岡縣，與同志商議革命基礎計劃，頭山滿先生又多方援助，總理提倡大亞洲主義，當時日本尚未雜居，不平等條約亦尚未究全取銷，所以與總理志同道合，相交至誠者，因總理提倡大亞洲主義，並未一味排斥白人，祗因白人在中國，堅持優越權利，驕傲態度，以不平等條約作後盾。所以要提倡大亞洲主義，爲求國際平等之地位而已。故頭山滿先生力賀總理之主張，即是國際之正誼，頭山滿先生，並亦主張，若要達到大亞洲主義國際平等之地位，必須先有中國革命之成功，所以二位先生始終是志同道合之相交。同盟會成立之始，總理奔走革命，締造民國，每逢艱難的時候，頭山滿先生必盡力援助之，在數十年前，知道革命是救中國唯一之大道者，寥寥無幾，即我中國人民，知而信行者，已經不多，何况頭山滿先生，是日本人，獨能深知此理，眞是難得，足稱先覺而無愧。辛亥年頭山滿先生亦來中國，贊助一切，至二次革命失敗後，總理以及各同志，都到日本，當時袁世凱之力，炙手可熱，向日本當局，要求拒絕總理上岸，當時頭山滿先生，闡明正義，向當局說明日本國際地位關係重大，不可應允，拒絕又對政治革命家上岸之理由，畢竟日本當局，以頭山滿先生·犬養毅先生·寺尾博士的話，理由正當，所以總理始得安然上岸，後即往東京假寓靈南阪上，與頭山滿先生鄰居，朝夕相見，自民國二年至五年，經三年餘的日子，中間每遇關於革命事業，或私人之事，多方相商於頭山滿先生。</p>
<p>頭山滿先生與總理私人感情，亦非常濃厚。中孚記得民國六年總理回國後到廣東，再度奮力革命，準備北伐，惟當時西南各省，帝制餘孽，頑固盤居，猶未肅淸，荊天棘地，進行遲遲，總理親率三軍，今日戰於東江，明日又馳北江，奮不顧身，與帝制餘孽相周旋，總理尚在前綫冒險，指揮同志，其時頭山滿先生，特派同志來廣東，向總理說，中國革命及北伐事業，早晚必成無疑，請總理不必時在前綫，過於冒險，如一朝設有意外，眞是中國革命前途之窒碍，以此一點，頭山滿先生於公於私，可爲總理之眞知己。其後總理北上，在中途得病，不幸故世，頭山滿先生深爲悲痛，俟到總理奉安之時，頭山滿先生已七十餘歲，但不遠重洋而來中國，親自執拂，中孚覺得頭山滿先生眞誠盛情，特別隆重。茲再將頭山滿先生平生的生活，及其他的情形，略爲一講。</p>
<p>自奉節儉對人寬恕</p>
<p>頭山滿先生目持嚴肅，自奉節儉，對人寬厚而忠恕，並對於中日兩國見解，高矚遠瞻，如游刃有餘，頭山滿先生以爲欲興東亞，必須助成我及中日興盛方足園亞洲之興盛，此點在今日，已經事實證明，確是毫無差誤之正路，而在多年之前，總理與頭山滿先生即深信而行之，實爲難得，頭山滿先生對於日本是絕對的勤王家，上對皇室，絕對尊重而忠實，但對中國革命事業，亦絕對贊助，因認爲中國革命，係由愛國發生之正義，故絕對贊成，且不惟對於中國革命盡力贊助，就是對於印度革命，菲律賓革命，亦多方援助。中孚在東京，記得有一年印度同志，正在東京進退徬徨之時，頭山滿先生以民間立場，出以至誠而救援同志，此頭山滿先生的胸襟淸楚，而豁達大度之表現，至於一世始終寡言，但有潛移默化之偉大力量，一言以蔽之，頭山滿先生是個偉大人物，祗要認爲是正義爲國家，對於此人終必庇蔭。</p>
<p>中日雨國發生戰事，頭山滿先生深爲沉痛，許多人力勸頭山滿先生赴重慶，調停兩國化敵爲友，惟頭山滿先生之意，爲兩國事跋山跡水，中途安危在所不辭，祇要尋到有一解鈴辦法，一切都可不計。吾們應該敬佩九十歲之老人，猶有如此偉大之勇氣，頭山滿先生前年八十八歲之誕辰，在東京兩國橋國技館，祝賀來賓，無憲數萬人，國內外絡繹不絕。今年是九十歲，本預定祝壽，不幸臥病於富士山下，遽爾棄養逝世，實爲大亞洲之損失，可惜可泣。頭山滿先生故世後之榮哀，據聞各地民問弔問者，往芝公園增上寺，一個月餘，每日從早到晚，無論晴天雨天，亦絡繹不絕。日本尊崇神教，並日本皇室特派敕使，賜榊一座，據說皇室賜榊，必須國家元勳等於國葬，始有賜榊，榊是日本特有之物，我國人恐多不甚明瞭，其物是一木質，但死後由皇特賜，是稀有之榮幸。如果公爵大臣，於國家有大功勛者。由宮內省奏請天皇恩賜，已覺少有，上已說過，只有數人，頭山滿先生又與此不同，因先生爲一平民，並無貴爵官位可言，故宮內省照例不能奏請，而此次實由天皇特恩賜給，其恩榮確比以前護得者，格外難得，實爲平民賜榊之第一人。或以前淸大人之賜謚比之，然亦不甚相同，考淸代給謚，只須一二品大員，死後即可獲得，得謚者甚多，雖曰榮典，實亦不可與日本賜榊難得稀有相比，况頭山滿先生平民得此，尤難能而可貴耶。實爲榮哀之至。</p>
<p>生前偉大死後哀榮</p>
<p>中孚今日喬加追悼會所講頭山滿先生生前經過，不足萬一，惟須請諸位汪意者：（一）頭山滿先生之人格，行爲，主義之公忠偉大，尤其對於中國之親善熱忱（二）今日爲東亞各國在上海的人民，追悼頭山滿先生，我們是以民衆的立塲，對他表示眞誠的哀悼可以說是眞正人民的公意，一切政治，最崇高的目的，一句話包括牠，不過求發揚人民的公意而已，不意在現狀之下，於追悼頭山滿先生，竟達到一次眞正的表現。頭山滿先生一生以平民資格，忠君愛國，扶弱抑强，其意志也是求政治淸明，而東亞興盛，則人民公意的表現，就是根本，我想九泉有知，頭山滿先生必定以今日的盛會，爲最合他的意志，而以爲最有光榮。</p>
<h3>日本民間代表　山田純三郎氏詞</h3>
<p>戰雲漠漠，蔽大陸之天空，江頭秋蘭，轉時景於蕭條，維昭和十九年十一月廿六日，在滬日華兩國民間團體有志之兩國民及大東亞盟邦諸民族代表等多數參列之下，謹以淸酌庶羞之奠，敬祭於大光院殿盛與慈山立雲居士故頭山滿先生英魂之前。不肖純三郎忝居末席，代表日本同志遙相追悼，藉表微忱。</p>
<p>值茲祖國日本刻在努力於大東亞十億民族有史以來之解放戰時，以全生涯致力此基調精神指導先覺頭山先生，竟享九十高壽，於十月五日溘然長逝。噩耗傳來，吾人莫不痛嘆。曩昔孫中山先生與日華兩國同志，以國民黨倡導中國革命，頭山先生與故犬養毅先生共予翼贊，激勵鼓舞，援助指導，以如海之懇情宏量，始終一貫之精神，迨武漢起義，辛亥一役，卒告達成。明治四十五年一月，中山先生在南京就任大總統，頭山犬養兩先生親赴南京來訪，慶祝激勵。昭和四年六月，國父遺靈南京奉安之際，兩先生再度參加，對革命仍各予臂助。吾人對兩先生之德。先生歿後，革命成功，犬養先生中途見棄，今復接頭山先生之訃告，吾人之感慨豈悽愴之而已哉！然目前事態日隨時代之推移與世局之展開，實現中山先生之遺訓，犬養先生殉血，亦已貢獻於日本維新之推進。頭山先生終生倡導援助之亞細亞十億民族之獨立解放之成果，三先生自當相顧含笑於九泉，然正視邇今全局之事態，尚有大陸一角暗影。頭山先生長逝，必引爲一大憾事。氏生前力主達成日華兩國全面協和與眞正提携，而彼渝方蟠居重慶，叛反國父遺教，如棄抗日之迷夢，則不致爲英美之走狗，重慶諸君頗多常年在東京受頤山先生教誨之人士，值茲戰局日益茍烈，皇軍敢鬥，每戰必克之大戰果，頻傳之際，重慶諸君聞頭山先生訃訊，將有幾何感懷耶？</p>
<p>茲者先生永眠，何日得以披瀝大東亞現狀與與復革命傳統之勇氣誠意，吾人願與諸君携手告祭於先生之靈乎？即希先生英魂一如在日，對吾人躬行之上，俯賜加護照鑑，尚饗！昭和十九年十一月二十六日，山田純三郎。」</p>

<h3>The Party Must Not Be Divided, the Country Must Be Unified: Declaration Issued by the Sixth Central Executive Committee Provisional Meeting</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese Nationalist Party held its sixth Central Executive Committee provisional plenary meeting yesterday, and the conference finally resolved to issue a declaration on the passing of Chairman Wang. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>"Declaration of the Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party on the Passing of Chairman Wang"</p>
<p>Advance Bravely and Fulfill the Legacy</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of the Republic [1925], the foundation of the revolution had just been established, and the revolutionary forces had not yet crossed Guangdong. Unfortunately, the Father of the Nation, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, departed from his comrades and passed away. Today, the country's difficulties and the seriousness of the situation are even greater than in the fourteenth year, and unfortunately, Chairman Wang also departed from his comrades and passed away at this time. This is truly an unfortunate event in the history of our party, and a cause for weeping and heartbreak for all comrades. The passing of the Father of the Nation caused immense grief to the comrades. With sorrowful troops, they bravely advanced, and the whole country followed. This led to the success of the Northern Expedition from the fifteenth to the seventeenth years [1926-1928]. With the passing of Mr. Wang, all party comrades should also transform their sorrow and grief into courage to sacrifice themselves, enduring hardship and toil, in order to complete the unfinished will of the deceased. The great task of nation-building is what those who survive should bear, and the brilliance of the revolutionary future may even surpass the era of the Northern Expedition.</p>
<p>Building a Country Based on the Three Principles of the People</p>
<p>In his will, the Father of the Nation instructed the people of the country, first, to "seek freedom and equality for China," and second, to "abolish unequal treaties." In recent years, under the leadership of Mr. Wang, the comrades of our party have been united in their efforts to realize this sacred goal. Since declaring war on Britain and the United States in January of last year, and concluding the alliance treaty with Japan, the unequal treaties imposed on China by Britain and the United States have been completely eliminated. Japan, fighting together with us, has also voluntarily renounced extraterritorial rights, returned concessions, and abolished the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol, and has agreed that once full peace is achieved, Japanese troops will be completely withdrawn. The responsibilities left to us by the Father of the Nation have been gradually completed by the comrades of our party under the leadership of Mr. Wang. This is something that the comrades of our party can use to comfort the spirit of the Father of the Nation in heaven, and to declare to the people of the country. However, the ultimate goal of the Father of the Nation is to build a new China based on the Three Principles of the People. Now that full peace has not yet been achieved, and the world war is about to enter its final decisive stage, the position of the Chinese nation is in the midst of the turbulent currents of war, and the promotion of civil rights and the improvement of people's livelihoods cannot be accelerated. The goals of the revolution have not been fully realized, and the ideals of nation-building have not been completed. How should the comrades of our party be united in heart and mind, and united in purpose, to work hard to remove the obstacles to the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and build a new China of the people, by the people, and for the people?</p>
<p>Anti-Communist Policy: Nanjing and Chongqing are the Same</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to temporary differences in opinions, the comrades of our party have been divided into Nanjing and Chongqing, and as a result, the country has not been unified and the pace has not been consistent. This is an undeniable fact, and our party feels deeply indebted to the people. Since the Sixth National Congress, we have shared the same doctrine, the same history, and the same destiny with our comrades. Although separated by two places, we have never ceased to think of them. We fully understand the arduous struggles of our comrades in Chongqing, and we have deep sympathy and infinite indignation for their inner pain and our own dangers. Whether comrades are in Nanjing or Chongqing, the coercion and difficulties they have suffered from the communists are not only the same, but even greater in the latter. At the beginning of our return to the capital, we raised the banner of anti-communism and diligently implemented it. The comrades in Chongqing are constrained by their environment and cannot act freely. If they slightly impose sanctions, they will be accused of undermining the united front. If they sincerely cooperate, the communists will secretly usurp political power, plunder military equipment, and use the momentum of invasion to satisfy their desire for annexation, leaving people helpless and in a dilemma. Anti-communism is the basic policy of our party, and anti-communism is the consistent spirit of our party. Now, due to the changing circumstances, it has been hijacked by the communists. In this environment, we express our deep sympathy and indignation. Although the comrades of our party may have temporary differences in opinions, their fundamental intentions are the same. The comrades in Nanjing are committed to anti-communism and national salvation, and the comrades in Chongqing should also be committed to this. Although the time and place may be different, the original intentions are the same. This is something that all comrades of our party can believe in and trust each other.</p>
<p>Breaking Away from Britain and the United States to Achieve Peace</p>
<p>The comrades in Nanjing are cooperating with Japan, while the comrades in Chongqing are held hostage by Britain and the United States. This is also an undeniable fact and the most unfortunate phenomenon for the country. Our party's struggle against British and American imperialism to break free from the shackles of unequal treaties has been a consistent revolutionary proposition for sixty years. The Father of the Nation's instructions have repeatedly reminded us of this. When the comrades in Nanjing declared war on Britain and the United States last year, the traditional policy of our party was able to be realized, and the power of Britain and the United States in China was eliminated. With the removal of the century-old enemy, China's freedom was obtained. This is truly a sacred undertaking achieved by our party after completing the great cause of the Northern Expedition. However, the aggressive policies of Britain and the United States in Chongqing have become even more intensified, colluding with the communists to interfere in internal affairs, ostensibly providing assistance, but secretly plotting to control us. The revolutionary comrades of the Chinese Nationalist Party are being coerced day and night by their congenital enemies, and the pain and regret in their hearts are self-evident. We firmly believe that the comrades in Chongqing will one day rise up and break free from the shackles of Britain and the United States, and join hands with us to achieve full peace. Those imperialists may denigrate the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty as empty words on paper, but they do not know that as the world situation evolves to this point, the Japanese people and government, whether in terms of morality or interests, will never allow themselves to be enemies with China again. Once full peace is established, there is no doubt that Japan will withdraw its troops in accordance with reason and the situation. Although they are intelligent, it is better to take advantage of the situation. The comrades in Chongqing should already be familiar with this.</p>
<p>Unite and Rebuild China</p>
<p>The party must not be divided, and the country must be unified. Mr. Wang made this clear to his comrades and announced it to the people when he left Chongqing. For six years, our arduous and determined struggle has been aimed at this goal. All party comrades, whether in Nanjing or Chongqing, whether for peace or war, should understand this sincerity. Now that Mr. Wang has passed away, we are not worried that the communists cannot be eradicated, but we are afraid that the comrades of our party cannot unite. We are not worried that the aggressive policies of imperialism cannot be resisted, but we are afraid that the revolutionary efforts will be gradually dispersed. We firmly believe that the peace movement led by Mr. Wang for six years has achieved great results and laid a solid foundation. The success or failure from now on depends only on whether the comrades can work hard. Looking back twenty years, with just Guangzhou, it unified the whole country in a few years. Looking at the present and recalling the past, the expansion of the situation from now on can only move forward and cannot hesitate. Today, we should urgently refine ourselves, unite, and fight against the communists and imperialism to rebuild China and unify our party. We must not harbor hopes of complacency or rely on others. The difficulty and danger of the current situation is greater than ever before. Only through struggle can we survive, and only through self-help can we receive divine assistance. May all comrades of our party and the people of the country strive together.</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Spirit of Toyama</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we mourned Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, "Friend of the Chinese Revolution," in the midst of a dismal rain. Why did we mourn him? The meaning of mourning him and the reasons why he is worthy of our mourning have already been discussed in the article "Mourning Mr. Mitsuru Toyama." However, after the mourning, thinking of our country and our current politics, we feel deeply moved and increasingly appreciate the preciousness and respectability of Mr. Toyama's spirit! We cannot help but express our thoughts.</p>
<p>Since the passing of Chairman Wang, "the National Government seems to have lost its pillar, and its future may face more difficulties" (see the remarks of Prince Konoe in this newspaper on the 13th). First, in terms of leadership, Mr. Chen Gongbo has now taken over. Mr. Chen has a deep understanding of Mr. Wang's loyalty to the country during his lifetime, his diligence in governance, and his ideals, and he is also the most capable of implementing them. The entire country unanimously supports him. At the same time, taking advantage of the presence of local officials in the capital, a national military and political conference was convened. The focus of the conference was to review the past and improve the future, so that the government and the people could be united as one to strengthen political and military power and assist in the Greater East Asia War. The importance of this conference is as Allied General Staff Officer Matsui said: "After the passing of Chairman Wang, the future of China depends entirely on this conference." What is most gratifying about this conference is that acting Chairman Chen was able to seriously and frankly review the past political shortcomings in his opening address. This can tell everyone that we do not need to worry too much about the difficulties in leadership. What we are worried about is whether the resolutions of this conference can be implemented thoroughly and realistically. This is the motivation for us to talk about the spirit of Toyama.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama's spirit is most prominently manifested in his patriotism and nationalism. At the age of twenty-one, he was already engaged in patriotic movements. In his hometown of Fukuoka Prefecture, he gathered like-minded comrades to form the Genyosha, with the aim of cultivating knowledge and exercising the body, hoping to be able to dedicate himself to the country in times of need. Many talented people emerged from his ranks and were very active during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese wars. Later, he published the Fukuoka Nichinichi Shimbun, advocating Pan-Asianism and engaging in practical guidance, dedicating his life to national affairs, and his contributions were very great. However, he remained uncrowned and unranked until his death. In terms of his life's achievements, he was the creator of the Japanese nationalist movement, the unifier of general social forces, and the promoter of Pan-Asianism. From his life's activities, we can understand that his patriotic thought has three characteristics: first, he consistently practiced patriotism without discouragement or rest; second, he organized societies and united comrades to cultivate talents for the country; third, he had no profit-seeking concepts and was loyal to the country. This is the foundation of Mr. Toyama's patriotic spirit.</p>
<p>A patriot who only cares about the interests of his own country and the development of his own nation will inevitably fall into narrow patriotism. Mr. Toyama was well aware of this and advocated Pan-Asianism, and in Sino-Japanese relations, he exclaimed: "Japan and China are one and the same country." After our Father of the Nation suffered adversity in London, he went to Japan and interacted with Mr. Toyama. Later, the Tongmenghui was established in Tokyo, and Mr. Toyama gave his full support. When the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the Father of the Nation returned from overseas, and Mr. Toyama rushed to Shanghai to greet him. Almost all of our patriots who went to Japan to visit Mr. Toyama listened to his teachings and received his guidance. China is the second force in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, so the Father of the Nation said: "Without Japan, there would be no China; without China, there would be no Japan." Mr. Toyama's "sincere" support for the Chinese revolution was due to his love for Japan, and therefore his love for China, and even his love for East Asia, without any intention of exploiting China. This is because he thoroughly understood the true meaning of Sino-Japanese cooperation that he was able to have a spirit of sincere good neighborliness.</p>
<p>The greatness of Mr. Toyama's spirit has been described above, but his success lies in his "perseverance" and "determination." Today, our country needs our rulers and people to have correct patriotic thought and pure nationalism, and at the same time cultivate our perseverance and determination to shoulder the heavy responsibility of saving the country and guiding politics on the right track, taking Mr. Toyama's spirit as an example.</p>
<p>Finally, acting Chairman Chen said in his address to the National Military and Political Conference: "What we lack today is not theory, not policy, but only perseverance and determination." These are truly incisive words that have identified the root causes of the political problems of the past. In the future, we must prescribe the right medicine for the disease. Therefore, we hope that the government will show "perseverance" and "determination" to perform surgery on the chronic diseases of politics and first see the spirit of Mr. Toyama in administrative facilities.</p>
<h3>Five Enemy Ships Sunk in the Eastern Sea off Luzon Island</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM on the 26th: (1) Since the morning of November 25th, the Kamikaze Special Attack Corps has launched a fierce attack on the enemy mobile forces that attacked the eastern sea off Luzon Island in northern Philippines. As of now, the confirmed results are as follows: one large aircraft carrier, one medium aircraft carrier, and one large cruiser sunk. (2) On November 25th, Japanese submarines launched a fierce attack on the enemy mobile forces in the eastern sea off Luzon Island, sinking one medium aircraft carrier and one destroyer each.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Surprise Attack on Morotai Island Inflicts Heavy Losses on the Enemy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Since the enemy Americans landed on Morotai Island on September 15th, they have built six airfields on the eastern end of the island, and there are two or three others, trying to build a large air force base to cooperate with the operations in the Philippines. The five airfields at the southern end bridgehead have all been completed, but they have been heavily damaged by the destructive operations of the Japanese troops on the island and the recent reinforcements. Currently, only the north and south airfields attached to the southern end bridgehead are usable. In order to strengthen the operations in the Philippines, the enemy Americans recently concentrated 300 to 400 aircraft at this airfield, but unexpectedly, they were subjected to surprise attacks by the Japanese air force on the 22nd and 13th, and were almost completely destroyed. According to the results of a reconnaissance by Japanese aircraft on the 24th, 15 large aircraft and 2 small aircraft were burned at the north guidance route, 4 large aircraft were heavily damaged, 12 large aircraft and 10 small aircraft were burned at the airfield, 1 large aircraft and 3 small aircraft were burned, 9 large aircraft and 8 small aircraft were burned at the west guidance route, and 16 large aircraft were burned at the south guidance route, totaling 79 aircraft. The losses suffered by the enemy American air force in this battle will have a great impact on future operations in the Philippines.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Reconnaissance Over Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) - Around 1:00 PM on the 26th, one enemy B-29 aircraft from the Mariana base invaded the high altitude near Tokyo at an altitude of over 10,000 meters, and after reconnaissance for about 30 minutes, it fled. The Japanese air force is still in pursuit, and the results have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>The Fall of Nanning</h3>
<p>South China Line Base, 26th (Central News Agency) - Nanning, the last base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing in South China, was captured by the Japanese army on the 24th. This Nanning operation started on the 19th, and the attack only took five days, advancing from Guixian to Nanning, which is 200 kilometers away. The speed of the advance has broken all previous records. When the Japanese army occupied Guiping on October 12th, the Chongqing army had already predicted that the Japanese army would attack Nanning. They immediately transferred the Guangxi army's 46th, 14th, and 21st armies from near Guilin and Liuzhou. In the afternoon, three divisions of the Guangdong army's 35th Army Group near Guixian also attempted to recapture Guiping, Danzhu, and Pingnan with a force of twelve divisions, while also trying to prevent the Japanese army from attacking Nanning. On the other hand, the Japanese army immediately broke into Guixian from the mountainous area southwest of Guiping, cutting off its retreat. The 9th Division of the Chongqing army was shaken and retreated from Nanning to Yishan, Du'an, and Jiangshan in the north. From then on, the Japanese army units waiting for an opportunity in the Guixian area believed that the opportunity had ripened and advanced along the Gui-Ning Highway, starting the attack. They occupied Binyang, the vanguard to Nanning, on the afternoon of the 21st, and in the mountainous area northeast of Nanning, they defeated about 1,000 Guangxi security guards. After communicating with the Japanese army that had advanced to the north of Binyang on the morning of the 24th, they finally broke into the city of Nanning at 9:00 AM, launching a mopping-up operation in the city and attacking the airfield west of the city, completely occupying it.</p>

<p>Chairman's Eulogy</p>
<p>Eulogy by Mr. Wen Lantao, Chairman of the Memorial Service: "Distinguished guests, today, various Chinese and Japanese circles in Shanghai are holding a memorial service for Elder Toyama. Your enthusiastic participation must make you all feel a layer of sorrow in your hearts, and pay tribute to this giant of East Asia. Elder Toyama's lifelong career has contributed to society and the country, and also to neighboring countries and even East Asia. He particularly supported China's revolutionary movement, so we, standing in the position of Chinese people, miss him even more. Elder Toyama's characteristics are his extraordinary courage, far-sightedness, firm will, and grand spirit. These characteristics are the factors that built his achievements and made him a giant of East Asia. However, although Elder Toyama has made great contributions to the country and society, he has never entered the officialdom, and has always assisted the government in the capacity of the people. This is even more commendable. We, standing in the position of the people, are even more respectful and admiring. Today, as we mourn Mr. Toyama, we should emulate his spirit, admire his deeds, and especially promote his far-sightedness to serve as the basis for Sino-Japanese cooperation. Secondly, my personal admiration for Mr. Toyama has been briefly expressed in a short article I wrote for today's (26th) memorial special issue of the newspaper. I won't repeat it here."</p>
<p>Speech of Thanks by the Representative of the Bereaved Family</p>
<p>Briefly stated: "Today, representatives and celebrities from various Chinese agencies and organizations have initiated and held such a grand and solemn memorial service for Elder Toyama, and representatives and celebrities from various Chinese and Japanese circles have participated. First of all, in the capacity of a member of Japan, I express my deep gratitude, and at the same time, I express my solemn gratitude to the Chinese preparatory committee. The Toyama family originally planned to come to Shanghai from Tokyo, Japan, to attend this memorial service and thank everyone, but unfortunately, due to circumstances, they were unable to come to Shanghai as scheduled. I am temporarily representing them to express my gratitude to you all. I must also convey today's enthusiasm to the Toyama family to leave a lasting expression of gratitude."</p>

<h3>Tram Lines 1, 2, 7, and 8 Resume All-Day Service, Trolleybuses Will Also Resume Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Urban Transportation Company (i.e., the Tram Company) has restricted tram service hours to conserve electricity. It has been learned that the Urban Transportation Company has decided to resume all-day service for trams (Lines 1, 2, 7, and 8) starting today (27th) due to the increased electricity supply in the city. Trolleybus services will also resume all-day service as soon as the electricity supply increases further.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Financial Work, Strict Enforcement</h3>
<p>The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the "Outline and Implementation Measures for Strengthening the Operations of Financial Institutions" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, has issued circulars to various banks, money shops, and trust companies, requiring them to report on schedule their payment reserve ratios, daily average total deposits, and loan application procedures. All financial institutions have complied with the order to report, and the first round of business reports has been submitted completely. It is reported that the office's review shows that very few financial institutions' first-round business reports meet the provisions of the outline. More than 70% of the deposits do not comply with laws and regulations. If financial institutions cannot improve their organizational structure and increase their deposit strength within three months, they will inevitably be eliminated, reorganized voluntarily, or cease operations. It is said that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office is determined to strictly enforce the strengthening work to ensure that Shanghai's financial institutions move towards normalcy and soundness.</p>

<p>Today, the Chinese and Japanese residents of Shanghai have initiated a memorial service for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, to mourn the giant of our neighboring country, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was born in Fukuoka Prefecture. The people of Fukuoka Prefecture have always produced many generous and patriotic individuals who have particularly supported our country's revolutionary comrades. Other parts of Japan, in all prefectures, have also supported revolutionary comrades, especially Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, who was a leader of the royalist movement among the people during the Meiji Restoration and made great efforts. When the Meiji Restoration was successful, many comrades and friends went to the government to take official positions. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, although his students were all over the world, was determined not to enter public service or accept official positions. For seventy or eighty years, he stood firmly among the people, fighting for national affairs. His will was firm and immovable as a mountain, and his character was extremely great. When our people heard of Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's firm will, they all straightened their clothes, admired and looked up to him.</p>
<p>Shared Ideals with Premier Sun</p>
<p>When Mr. Sun Zhongshan, the Premier of our Party, advocated the Chinese revolution, he first went to Japan and, before the establishment of the Tongmenghui, went to Fukuoka Prefecture to discuss the basic plan for the revolution with his comrades. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama provided assistance in many ways. The Premier advocated Pan-Asianism. At that time, Japan had not yet achieved racial integration, and unequal treaties had not yet been completely abolished. Therefore, those who shared the same ideals with the Premier and were sincere friends were united by the Premier's advocacy of Pan-Asianism, which did not blindly exclude white people, only because white people in China insisted on their superior rights and arrogant attitude, backed by unequal treaties. Therefore, Pan-Asianism was advocated to seek an equal international position. Therefore, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama strongly supported the Premier's proposal, which was the international righteousness. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama also advocated that in order to achieve Pan-Asianism and an equal international position, the Chinese revolution must first succeed. Therefore, the two gentlemen were always friends who shared the same ideals. From the beginning of the establishment of the Tongmenghui, the Premier traveled for the revolution and created the Republic of China. Whenever he encountered difficulties, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama always did his best to help him. Decades ago, there were very few who knew that revolution was the only way to save China. Even among our Chinese people, not many knew, believed, and acted. How much more difficult it was for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, who was Japanese, to deeply understand this principle. He was truly worthy of being called a pioneer. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama also came to China in 1911 to support everything. After the failure of the Second Revolution, the Premier and his comrades went to Japan. At that time, Yuan Shikai's power was at its peak. He asked the Japanese authorities to refuse the Premier to land. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama clarified justice and explained to the authorities that Japan's international position was of great importance and should not be agreed to. He refused to allow the political revolutionaries to land. After all, the Japanese authorities, based on the words of Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi, and Dr. Terao, believed that the reasons were justified, so the Premier was able to land safely. Later, he went to Tokyo and lived next door to Mr. Mitsuru Toyama in Reianzaka. They met every day, and from 1913 to 1916, they often discussed matters related to the revolutionary cause or private matters with Mr. Mitsuru Toyama.</p>
<p>Mr. Toyama's Personal Relationship with the Premier Was Very Strong</p>
<p>Zhongfu remembers that in 1917, after the Premier returned to China and went to Guangdong, he made another effort to carry out the revolution and prepared for the Northern Expedition. However, at that time, the remnants of the imperial system in the southwestern provinces were stubbornly entrenched and had not yet been eliminated. The progress was slow and difficult. The Premier personally led the three armies, fighting in the East River today and rushing to the North River tomorrow, regardless of his own safety, and fought with the remnants of the imperial system. The Premier was still risking his life on the front line, directing his comrades. At that time, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama specially sent comrades to Guangdong to tell the Premier that the Chinese revolution and the Northern Expedition would undoubtedly succeed sooner or later. Please do not be too adventurous on the front line. If there is an accident, it will really hinder the future of the Chinese revolution. From this point, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama can be called the Premier's true friend in both public and private matters. Later, the Premier went north and fell ill on the way. Unfortunately, he passed away. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was deeply saddened. When the Premier was buried, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was already over seventy years old, but he came to China across the ocean and personally assisted in the burial. Zhongfu felt that Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's sincerity was particularly grand. Now, I will briefly talk about Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's life and other situations.</p>
<p>Frugal in Self-Discipline and Generous in Forgiveness</p>
<p>Mr. Mitsuru Toyama looked serious, was frugal in self-discipline, and was kind and forgiving to others. He had a high and far-sighted understanding of the relations between China and Japan. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama believed that to revitalize East Asia, we must help China and Japan prosper in order to achieve the prosperity of Asia. This point has already been proven by facts today, and it is indeed the correct path without any deviation. The Premier and Mr. Mitsuru Toyama believed in it many years ago, which is truly rare. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was an absolute royalist to Japan. He was absolutely respectful and loyal to the imperial family, but he also absolutely supported the Chinese revolutionary cause, because he believed that the Chinese revolution was a righteous cause arising from patriotism, so he absolutely supported it. Moreover, he not only made every effort to support the Chinese revolution, but also provided assistance to the Indian revolution and the Philippine revolution in many ways. Zhongfu remembers that in Tokyo, one year, when Indian comrades were at a loss in Tokyo, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, in his capacity as a civilian, sincerely rescued them. This is Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's clear-minded, open-minded, and generous expression. As for being silent all his life, he had the great power of subtle influence. In a word, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was a great man. As long as he believed it was righteous for the country, he would eventually protect this person.</p>
<p>When war broke out between China and Japan, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama was deeply saddened. Many people persuaded Mr. Mitsuru Toyama to go to Chongqing to mediate and turn the two countries from enemies into friends. However, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's intention was to travel across mountains and rivers for the two countries, regardless of the dangers along the way, as long as he could find a solution, he would not care about anything. We should admire the 90-year-old man for having such great courage. At Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's 88th birthday two years ago, tens of thousands of guests came to celebrate at the Kokugikan in Ryogoku, Tokyo, and people came from home and abroad. This year was his 90th birthday, and it was originally planned to celebrate it, but unfortunately, he fell ill at the foot of Mount Fuji and passed away suddenly, which was a great loss for Asia. It is a pity and regrettable. It is said that after Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's death, the mourners from all over the world went to Zojoji Temple in Shiba Park for more than a month, from morning to night, regardless of whether it was sunny or rainy. Japan respects Shintoism, and the Japanese imperial family specially sent an imperial messenger to present a sakaki tree. It is said that the imperial family only bestows sakaki to national heroes at state funerals. Sakaki is unique to Japan, and I am afraid that many of our people do not understand it very well. It is a wooden object, but it is a rare honor to be specially bestowed by the emperor after death. If a duke or minister has made great contributions to the country, the Ministry of the Imperial Household can request the Emperor to bestow it as a favor, which is already rare. As I said before, there are only a few people who have received it. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama is different from this, because he is a commoner and has no noble title or official position, so the Ministry of the Imperial Household cannot request it as usual. This time, it was specially granted by the Emperor, and the favor was indeed more difficult to obtain than before. It was the first time that a commoner was bestowed sakaki. Or compare it to the posthumous titles bestowed to high officials in the Qing Dynasty, but it is not very similar. In the Qing Dynasty, only high officials of the first or second rank were required to obtain posthumous titles after death, and many people obtained them. Although it was said to be an honor, it was not comparable to the rarity of the Japanese bestowal of sakaki. Moreover, Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, as a commoner, obtained this, which was even more rare and commendable. It was the greatest honor.</p>
<p>Great in Life and Mourned After Death</p>
<p>What Zhongfu has said today at the memorial service about Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's life is less than one ten-thousandth, but I would like to ask everyone to pay attention to: (1) Mr. Mitsuru Toyama's personality, behavior, and the greatness of his public loyalty, especially his kindness and enthusiasm towards China; (2) Today, the people of various East Asian countries in Shanghai are mourning Mr. Mitsuru Toyama. We are expressing our sincere condolences from the standpoint of the people. It can be said that it is the true public opinion of the people. All politics, the most sublime purpose, can be included in one sentence, but it is only to promote the public opinion of the people. Unexpectedly, under the current situation, the memorial service for Mr. Mitsuru Toyama has achieved a truly complete expression. Mr. Mitsuru Toyama spent his life as a commoner, loyal to the emperor and loving the country, supporting the weak and suppressing the strong. His will was also to seek political clarity and the prosperity of East Asia. The expression of public opinion is the foundation. I think that if Mr. Mitsuru Toyama knew in the afterlife, he would surely regard today's grand gathering as the most in line with his will and the most glorious.</p>
<h3>Speech by Mr. Junzaburo Yamada, Representative of the Japanese People</h3>
<p>The smoke of war covers the sky over the continent, and the autumn orchids at the riverbank turn the scenery into desolation. On this 26th day of November, Showa 19, with the participation of many representatives of Japanese and Chinese civilian organizations and like-minded people in Shanghai, as well as representatives of various ethnic groups in the Great East Asian Allied nations, I respectfully offer this clear wine and delicious food to the spirit of the late Mr. Mitsuru Toyama, Grand Light Court Hall, Prosperity, Compassionate Mountain, Standing Cloud Layman. I, Junzaburo, am honored to be in the last seat, representing Japanese comrades to express our condolences from afar, to express our meager sincerity.</p>
<p>At this time, when our motherland Japan is working hard to fight for the liberation of the ten billion peoples of Great East Asia, the guiding spirit of Mr. Toyama, who devoted his entire life to this keynote, passed away on October 5 at the age of ninety. When the bad news came, we were all saddened. In the past, when Mr. Sun Zhongshan and comrades from Japan and China advocated the Chinese revolution with the Kuomintang, Mr. Toyama and the late Mr. Inukai Tsuyoshi gave their support, encouragement, assistance, and guidance with a sea-like sincerity and a consistent spirit, until the Wuchang Uprising and the Xinhai Revolution finally succeeded. In January of Meiji 45, when Mr. Zhongshan took office as President in Nanjing, Mr. Toyama and Mr. Inukai visited Nanjing in person to celebrate and encourage him. In June of Showa 4, when the remains of the Father of the Nation were enshrined in Nanjing, the two gentlemen participated again and continued to assist in the revolution. We are grateful for the virtue of the two gentlemen. After the death of the two gentlemen, the revolution succeeded, Mr. Inukai was abandoned midway, and now we have received the obituary of Mr. Toyama. How can our feelings be merely sad! However, the current situation is changing with the times and the development of the world situation. The implementation of Mr. Zhongshan's legacy and Mr. Inukai's martyrdom have also contributed to the promotion of the Japanese Restoration. Mr. Toyama's lifelong advocacy and assistance for the independence and liberation of the ten billion peoples of Asia, the three gentlemen should look at each other and smile in the afterlife. However, looking at the current situation as a whole, there is still a dark shadow in one corner of the continent. Mr. Toyama's death is bound to be a great regret. He advocated for the full harmony and true cooperation between Japan and China during his lifetime, but the Chongqing side is entrenched in Chongqing, rebelling against the teachings of the Father of the Nation. If they abandon the dream of resisting Japan, they will not be dogs of the United States and Britain. Many of the Chongqing gentlemen have been taught by Mr. Toyama in Tokyo for many years. At a time when the war situation is becoming increasingly severe, the Imperial Army is fighting bravely, and the great victories that are won in every battle are frequently reported, how will the Chongqing gentlemen feel when they hear the news of Mr. Toyama's death?</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Toyama is resting in peace forever, when will we be able to lay bare the current situation in East Asia and the courage and sincerity to restore the revolutionary tradition, and we are willing to join hands with you to offer sacrifices to Mr. Toyama's spirit? I hope that Mr. Toyama's spirit, as it was in Japan, will guide us in our actions and bestow blessings and protection. Showa 19, November 26th, Yamada Junzaburo."</p>
