<p>社評</p>
<h3>論戰時建設</h3>
<p>戰爭是磁塲，同時也是建設；為爭取最在瓦　塲中艱苦奮鬥而來的建設，方才是眞</p>
<p>戰時建設不比平時。平時有的是人力物力，更有充裕的時間。戰時的建設，人力缺乏，物力缺乏，時間緊迫。戰時的建設一方面是急切需要，一方面是萬分困雄。要克服這些困難，必須脚踏實地，用艱苦卓絕的精神力量　充物質的缺憾，然後方能排除萬難</p>
<p>戰建設第一要注意的便是實幹。現在不是講形式，裝點門面的時候，更沒有說大話，發宜言的空暇。跟前不需要的不必想，不必說。眼前需要的就該立刻去做，做一件是一件，成功一點是一點。辦公室內的計劃，假如渡有真實的行勃相配合，等於沒有計劃，徒然浪費精神，金錢和時間。如果公家機關把沒有行動的計劃隨意發佈，更足影響他的戚德。我們不反對計劃，可是我們更着重　數的實行，過去所謂「議而不决，決而不行」的毛病，平時已經要不得，戰時更是不應　　實幹的精神，換句話說，就是脚踏實地的工作，只有這種工作是一步一步，一　一滴漸漸走向成功之路。我們唯一希望全國上下的是真實工作的表現，同時國家需要的只是真實工作成績，這裹面一點不能含糊，一點不能欺騙。</p>
<p>戰時建設第二要注意的就是苦幹，擺在眼前的適宜，處處表現建設條件的缺乏，但建設工作現在固然食談不到，將來或許就倫不到我們去工作了。戰時建設一方面增加我們的力量，一方面就减少敵人的力量，敵人和我們正在競賽，看誰佔着先着，誰就勝利。那末，怎樣才能做建設工作呢？千句併一句，只有苦幹。幾個人可以做的工作，就不工作，不妨夜裹繼續地去做。正如德實蘇　翁所說：「太太作娘姨的事情，有什麼丟臉人的必要，然而如無僕人就行不通嗎？想喝地記住着這是非常時期，那末國家一定可作出超過今日數十倍的工作」。這就是苦幹請任何險阻，而達到最後的成功。</p>
<p>我們看過去日本朋治維新以後的富强，德國第一次大戰後的經濟復興，蘇俄的五年計劃，大家覺得有無限的羨慕。可是，這不是僥倖的成功。我們護了日本的近代史，德國的復興史，蘇俄的五年計劃史，我們知道這一切的成功，都是他們全國上下脚踏實地，在艱苦困難中，埋頭苦幹所創造出來的。他們的實幹精神，苦幹精神，已經建設了他們的國家。我們的精神呢？我們將要怎樣建設我們的國家？</p>
<h3>印緬國境線附近日軍展開滅戰　另一有力部隊渡更的宛河</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日大本營二十一日下午二時發表：緬甸方面我部隊與印度國民軍協力，於三月八日對　丘陵附近之英印軍展開　於二月十五日在霍馬林附近渡過更的宛河，刻正向印　國境方而進攻中</p>

<p>東京二十一日中央社電　據緬甸前線日軍某基地電，日軍二十日佔領敵軍據點頓扎恩，刻正繼續掃藩周國殘敵，他方梯迭姆之敵軍，亦與噸扎恩失陷之同時完全崩潰。英印萬十五師主力曾驚駛九千數百輛汽事，愴慌中超至馬尼布爾河畔，雷西市長以下敵兵咸拋棄軍器渡過於尼馬爾河，陸續向印領遁逃。又日軍　處　滅見敗敵，刻正擴大戰果中。</p>

<h3>印主席鮑斯　對民眾演說　印度之解放指日可待</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　據緬甸日軍某基地前綫歸來之飽斯主席，十九日特於某基地舉行第二國民眾大會，是時鮑斯主席於數萬民眾前發表演說稱：關於阿拉坎作戰之目的，並非勝敗之問題，其目的乃係突入印度，因吾等實際之任務，係在新印度之建設。今敵人己臨　風雨之前夕，故印度國民軍當樂虛攻入印度國內。以究成解放祖國之偉大事榮，况阿拉坎琴丘陵地帶　買地區以及細甸國境各方面，均在酣　中，我等何時由何地進入印度雖　言明，然相信於印度國內之戰爭即將開始。最近根據由詞拉圾賤綫認來之某少佐報告稱：國民軍將兵之戰鬥精神極為旺盛，該少佐率領之一隊，於阿拉坎某丘陵將敵軍之印兵部隊包國時，彼等當即　順，同時某隊之另一隊會奇襲敵軍司令部，並佔領之，而獲得偉大之戰果，雖有時印國民軍感貪　之不足，然依舊阿拉　　山脈中繼續行進，其含辛茹苦之意志，誠然可嘉，吾入相信於印人團結一致之奮門下，印度之解放指日可</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　居於日本之印度獨立聯盟最高顧問比哈利鮑斯氏，以二十一日為自由印度臨時政府成立紀念日，特於是日向印度國民廣播濱說，大意謂：余居留日本迄今已垂二十餘年，近日得同諸君詳談，實深慶倖，余於此確信，余不久將參加話君之奮戰，余並深望話君聆聽余之廣播演說，並將余之一致轉達於其他印人。余於此尤盼吾等印人竭其全力從事份門，直至獲得最後勝利　成獨立之日而後已。</p>

<h3>殷汝耕視察返京　談治運方針　本年底前可通航</h3>
<p>南京二十日中央社電　直隸運河籌備處主任綫狀况，與明瞭各地中日官民地方士紳等，對治理運河之意見，特予定分期視察計劃，於上月親偕隨員赴揚州實應高郵等地勢察，與各地中日官民地方土紳等，舉行懇談會，商討謝治理運河之意見，結果極為國滿，各地官民無不願盡最大力量，予以協助。殷氏復於本月十三日偕同該處企劃組長林耕宇，秘書任參天，燒啓新，　按　專家以及盟邦日本總司令部代表，日本大使館代表數十餘人，赴徐州海州連雲港運河站蚌埠等地視察，於昨二十日下午一時完畢，由蚌返京，中央社記者以運河修理後，不僅南北物資多一通路，亦有莫大恭獻，故為明瞭股氏此行之觀感，與今後直隸運河方針，特前往訪有千餘年歷史，為實獻我國荊南米遭運至北方之唯之萬里長城，同稱為世界偉大工程，錯自</p>
<p>淸季以來</p>
<p>由於黃河改道，橫斷運河，以致河身淤墓，年年疏　，費用不贊，　庚子賠款以後，財政困難，淸廷遂下令廢河道曾運，各總督並停止治河經費，因是河政　弛，相沿至今，竟不能完其南北交通大動脈之生命，王為可惜、然回顧世界各國，其鐵道公路，雖密如蜘網，對運河仍極重視，况我國交通既不甚發達，幅員又極遼廣，物資經濟，亟待溝進、且大東亞戰爭後，海運船舶頗感不足，鐵路貨物又極擁擠，因是政府特成立治理運河籌備處，修理運河，派本人為主任，唯茲事體大，非有大量人力物力不可，而本人才力又有限，故為明瞭各方對治運之意見，特訂定</p>
<p>分期視察</p>
<p>計劃·一則明　各地遲河狀况，一則便聆各地中日官民地方士紳水利專家等對治運之意見，每至一地均承各省長縣長等然烈招待，衷心至為感謝，更於每次懇談會中，得聆許多高見，唯因時間忽促。未能一一聆教。各方對治運意見，故盼各方對治運如有其他意見，能以書面送交本處，則為本處同人所感盼，至今後</p>
<p>治運方針</p>
<p>擬將全運河分篇津臨段，臨濟段，濟淮段，淮江段，鎮蘇段，蘇枕段等六段，共長一千五百公里，全部通航時，江南運河以能航行九百　，江北運河以能航行三百噸貨船為目標，第一期修築工程，除由台兒莊至瓜州一段間，定四月中旬或五月初旬着手進行修業，倘無其他事件，則本年底前便可通航，總之此項工程極為艱難，本人才力有限，尚希中日各方竭力協助，傳平日修理完竣物資得以流通，而期有所貢獻於大東亞戰爭。</p>
<p>轉赴蘇杭</p>
<p>南京二十一日中央社電　治理運河　備處主任設汝耕氏，為權績觀察運河工作、與明瞭各地中日官民地方士　等對治理運河之意見，　於二十一日上午九時再度　同該處企　組長林耕字，財務組長當　溪，秘書任　天，邵啓新，　技術取　以及即邦日本總司令部代表，在蘇親察究　後，並將至杭州視察。</p>

<h3>汪曼雲赴漢視察</h3>
<p>漢口二十一日中央社電　演鄉事務局長汪學運，為視察淸鄉工作，於日前抵漢，並發表談話。</p>
<h3>列國統帥陣容一瞥</h3>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>蘇聯與一九四一年六月三十日德蘇開戰後不久，即發立「最高國防委員會」，成為軍政與軍令三兀化的機關，委員長由黨務書長兼國防人民委員史丹林兼任，委員是外交部長莫洛托夫，伏羅柏洛夫元　以下中丹林的心腹首腦部人物。最近盛傳史丹林自任大元帥·尚未經設實。參謀總長耕希萊夫斯某元帥。柯茲奈車夫海　人民委員，分掌史丹林委員長以下的革務·統帥興國務的劃一化，在蘇聯是無疑地充全實行，最近雖將關防權與外交　移觀各共和邦，但在本質上，並無何項變更。</p>
<p>英國</p>
<p>英國的陸海空軍，各自完全獨立，軍政和軍令相對立，即陸軍方面，陸相寫克里克，參謀總長為阿朋·勃魯克·海軍方面·海相為亞力山大，軍令部長為克　漢·空軍方面·空相為辛克萊、空軍總司令官為波泰爾，這種併立的制　。依然存在。</p>
<p>陸海三相司里軍教，對讓會負責任。職爭時期。軍政大部份　於國防會議，其間，三軍時舉行聯　務會設，以諜橫的聯絡、在這機構之上，是總縱軍令軍政的首相兼國務相邱吉爾。他以首相的地位，主持國務，同時以國防相的地位，統帶參謀總長，軍令部長，空軍總司令官。軍略機關方面。設有國防會議、邱吉爾自兼綫長。同時為　通應下各級關的意見，計設有連絡將　和代理國防一　，由陸軍中將　　梅任之，</p>
<p>美國</p>
<p>美國的。切軍政大權，最後决定於大總統兼陸海空軍最高司令官羅斯福。在犬東亞戰爭爆發前不久，陸海軍內部還是對立的狀態，聽命於最高司令官，但自開戰之初，在真珠灣開始，在珊瑚海·南太平洋等處屢次海空戰敗北，羅斯福總統獻設置一大總統直屬的橫的聯務機關，起用海軍大將李希，為陸海軍長官。至於陸軍部長史汀　和海軍部長　古　等。專嫦對付　會關係之用，兩人對於軍部內部。控制力　為　弱、軍令方血、陸軍參謀長為馬紹爾。海軍作戰部長兼聯合　隊司令長官為金格。近代戰爭中，空軍的威力增大？美國國內，設立空軍部的呼聲，其器慶上　但在機構上，空軍依然是陸軍的一部份，為地上部除司令官　克奈耶，兵站本部長廢麥維爾相並行，並任命。真珠灣一役以來，空軍第一主義抬頭安諾裁的指揮權，他和馬紹爾共回參商　內與國外的作　計劃</p>
<p>此即以羅斯福為總司令官，組織英美聯合參謀本部，更在華盛頓集合反輸心各國代表」設立反軸心聯合參謀本郃，安諾爾德出席為紹爾和金格的兩參謀部，員有有力的發言機，（完）（譯自二月二十四日每日新聞）</p>
<h3>德元首洪聶政　作緊急會談　强化東南歐軍事行動</h3>
<p>沮利克二十一日中央社電據土耳其安那托利通訊社不加勒多電稱：希特勒元首二十日於行營，曾邀請洪牙利攝政霍第提督及洪牙利軍總司令官，舉仃緊急會談。</p>

<h3>On Wartime Construction</h3>
<p>War is a magnetic field, and also construction; the construction that comes from struggling arduously in the rubble field is the real construction.</p>
<p>Wartime construction is not like peacetime construction. In peacetime, there is plenty of manpower and resources, and even more ample time. In wartime construction, manpower is lacking, resources are lacking, and time is pressing. Wartime construction is both urgently needed and extremely difficult. To overcome these difficulties, one must be grounded in reality, and use the spirit of arduous and outstanding strength to compensate for the lack of material resources, and then one can overcome all difficulties.</p>
<p>The first thing to pay attention to in wartime construction is practical work. Now is not the time to talk about form, decorate the façade, let alone talk big and issue empty declarations. Things that are not needed in the immediate future should not be thought about or talked about. What is needed right now should be done immediately, doing one thing at a time, succeeding a little at a time. Plans in the office, if not matched with real action, are equal to no plans, and only waste energy, money and time. If public institutions arbitrarily release plans without action, it will further affect their prestige. We are not against planning, but we emphasize even more the practical implementation. The past problem of "deliberating without deciding, deciding without acting" was already unacceptable in peacetime, and even more so in wartime. The spirit of practical work, in other words, is down-to-earth work. Only this kind of work gradually moves towards the road to success step by step, drop by drop. Our only hope for the whole country, from top to bottom, is the performance of real work, and at the same time, what the country needs is only the results of real work. There can be no ambiguity in this, no deception.</p>
<p>The second thing to pay attention to in wartime construction is hard work. The suitable things are placed in front of your eyes, and the lack of construction conditions is manifested everywhere, but if construction work cannot be talked about now, perhaps we will not be able to work in the future. Wartime construction, on the one hand, increases our strength, and on the other hand, reduces the enemy's strength. The enemy and us are competing to see who takes the lead, and whoever takes the lead will win. So, how can we do construction work? Thousands of sentences merge into one sentence, only hard work. If a job can be done by several people, do not not work, you may as well continue to do it at night. As Dr. Soussou said, "What is the need to be ashamed of a wife doing the work of a maid, but is it impossible without servants? Remember that this is a very special time, then the country will definitely be able to produce dozens of times more work than today." This is hard work to overcome any obstacles and achieve final success.</p>
<p>We look at the prosperity of Japan after the Meiji Restoration in the past, the economic recovery of Germany after the First World War, and the Five-Year Plan of Soviet Russia, and everyone feels infinite admiration. However, this is not a fluke success. We have protected the modern history of Japan, the history of the revival of Germany, and the history of the Soviet Five-Year Plan. We know that all these successes were created by their entire country, from top to bottom, working hard and diligently in arduous difficulties. Their spirit of practical work and hard work has built their country. What about our spirit? How are we going to build our country?</p>

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister to Explain Policies and Determination in the House of Representatives Nationwide Training of Young Men in Swimming</h3>

<h3>Advisor Ogawa Returns to Japan from Burma</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Shotaro Ogawa, advisor to the Burmese government, departed from Rangoon by plane on the afternoon of the 19th to consult with the Japanese government on important matters. He temporarily stayed in Guangzhou on his way back to his country and set off again for Shanghai on the morning of the 20th. He described the recent situation in Burma as follows: The Burmese people are all able to ____ measure the meaning of war and can truly cooperate in the new construction on the national knot. Their character is quite similar to that of the Japanese. Their spiritual and material contribution to the Holy War is no less than that of any nation in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, they have no dissatisfaction and are willing to open their hearts to the Japanese with enthusiasm. In the past, the British not only exploited the Burmese people, but even tried to anesthetize them, so that they developed the bad habit of idleness. As a result of this war, their national character has been completely changed.</p>
<h3>Indian Chairman Bose Addresses the People India's Liberation is Imminent</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Chairman Bose, who returned from a certain Japanese army base on the Burmese front, held the Second National People's Congress at a certain base on the 19th. At that time, Chairman Bose delivered a speech in front of tens of thousands of people, saying: The purpose of the Arakan operation is not a matter of victory or defeat, but rather to break into India, because our actual task is to build a new India.

<h3>Yin Rugeng Returns to Beijing After Inspection Discusses Governance and Transportation Policies Navigation Possible Before the End of the Year</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the Director of the Zhili Canal Preparation Office _____ situation and to understand the opinions of Chinese and Japanese officials and local gentry on the management of the canal, a planned period of inspections was specifically scheduled. Last month, he personally accompanied staff to Yangzhou, where he conducted on-the-spot inspections, and held cordial meetings with Chinese and Japanese officials and local gentry to discuss the opinions of Xie on the management of the canal. The results were extremely satisfactory, and officials and people from all over the country were willing to do their best to assist.

At 1:00 PM yesterday, the 20th, they finished their inspection and returned to Beijing from Bengbu. Central News Agency reporters believe that the repair of the canal will not only provide another passage for materials between the north and the south, but also make a great contribution. Therefore, in order to understand the views of the stock market on this trip and the future policy of the Zhili Canal, they specially visited the history of more than a thousand years, as the only Great Wall in the world dedicated to transporting rice from Jingnan in our country to the north, and were equally known as a magnificent world project.</p>
<p>Since the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Due to the change of course of the Yellow River, the canal was cut off, resulting in the canal being silted up. The annual dredging ____ was costly. After the Boxer Indemnity, financial difficulties arose, and the Qing court ordered the abolition of the canal and the cessation of transportation, and the governors-general stopped the river management funds. As a result, the river administration was relaxed and continued to this day, and it has not been able to complete the life of the north-south transportation artery, which is a pity. However, looking back at the countries of the world, although their railways and highways are as dense as spider webs, they still attach great importance to canals. Moreover, the transportation in our country is not very developed, the area is extremely vast, and the material economy urgently needs to be communicated. After the Greater East Asia War, the number of maritime transport ships is quite insufficient, and railway cargo is extremely congested. Therefore, the government specially established a preparation office for governing the canal to repair the canal and appointed me as the director. However, this matter is of great importance and requires a large amount of manpower and resources, but my talents are limited. Therefore, in order to understand the opinions of all parties on the management of the canal, I specially formulated</p>
<p>Planned inspections</p>
<p>In one case, the river conditions in various places were clear, and in one case, the opinions of Chinese and Japanese officials, local gentry, and water conservancy experts on the management of the canal in various places were heard. Every place was warmly welcomed by the provincial governors and county magistrates, for which I am extremely grateful. Moreover, I was able to hear many high opinions at each cordial meeting, but the time was too hasty. I was unable to ask for advice one by one. All parties have opinions on the management of the canal. Therefore, I hope that if all parties have other opinions on the management of the canal, they can submit them to this office in writing, which is what our colleagues at this office are looking forward to.</p>
<p>Future governance policy</p>
<p>It is planned to divide the entire canal into six sections: the Jinlin Section, the Linji Section, the Jihuai Section, the Huaijiang Section, the Zhensu Section, and the Suzhou Pillow Section, with a total length of 1,500 kilometers. When all sections are open to navigation, the goal is for the Jiangnan Canal to be able to navigate 900 ____, and the Jiangbei Canal to be able to navigate 300-ton cargo ships. The first phase of construction will begin in mid-April or early May, except for the section from Taierzhuang to Guazhou. If there are no other incidents, navigation will be possible before the end of this year. In short, this project is extremely difficult, and my talent is limited. I still hope that all parties from China and Japan will do their best to assist, so that after the repair is completed, materials can be circulated, and we can make a contribution to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
