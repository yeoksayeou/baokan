<p>社評</p>
<h3>調整統制機構</h3>
<p>調整通知機構問題，宣傳甚久，最近聞已決定：　修改統治商品品目，僅限於民生日用必需品。　分別成立各統制委員會，為實施統制機關。　以全國商業統制總會為綜合監督審核及聯絡機關，不再直接辦理統制工作。本月十四日，政府發表改派聞蘭亭氏爲商統會理事長，並改粉麥專業委員會爲粉麥統制委員會，即為實行調整步驟之第一聲。統制機構經此番調整之後，將益臻於健全周密，吾人誠不勝為統制前途幸！</p>
<p>統制工作在我國為創舉，既無章制可循，尤非民情所習。過去一年餘，商統會工作之艱苦，以及應付之為難，凡稍明瞭該會情形者，類能予以同情之諒解。唐壽民氏身膺艱鉅，一載有餘，律已謹嚴，勇於負責，使統治工作得以略具規模，其功亦不可沒。所不能不引爲遺憾者，收買紗布工作，迄今尚未結束。新產品處置辦法，至今尚未規定，以致仰配給者則望眼欲穿，辦工廠者則停工坐食，影響經濟流通，減少物資增產，此其一。保留數量之如何規定，並未宣佈；核定數量之多寡，亦無絕對標準，縱屬居心無他，理山具在，而畸輕畸重之間，即不免啟人成立倉卒，對於用人方面，容未能選擇悉當其中不無未能深體該會『公正廉明』之服務信條者，遂不免予社曾以指摘，此其三。所最可惜者，該會成立以後，因政令之紛岐，與事械之不統一，以致大部份時問皆須耗於政治折衝工作，故統制效率之未能竟達預期目的，亦半由環境所造成。今後統制機構雖加調整，但如事實之困難，政府不為一一設法解除，則又豈僅調整統制機構所能奏效。故今後統制之有無辦法，仍當視政府命令之能否統一，與盟邦當局之能否進一步協助。此外，吾人希望於統制樓關本身者，亦有四點：</p>
<p>目前最嚴重之問題，在上海為民食恐慌，在內地為日用工業品恐慌，皆有岌岌不可終日之勢。流通調節，不僅可以解決民生之痛苦，並可以促進金融之流通。</p>
<p>收購配給，最後仍須仰給生產。生產不機，則收購配給皆徒託空言。故統制機關最大之工作，在與經濟行政機關密切合作，盡量解決產業界之痛苦，以促進物資之增加。</p>
<p>人事問題為任何機關最重要之問題，過去各統治機關之所以不能免於社會指摘，人事問題實佔最大成份。故各統治機關，今後對於用人一端，在才幹之外，尤當特別注重操守。</p>
<p>此次調整，益見政府常局充分信賴上海工商界領袖，予以自主機會。深盼工商界認淸目前在戰時，且已面臨決戰階段，絕非平時可比。過去以小我利益為前提者，應即放棄，而「滅私奉公」，應為今後當局與各業共同採取之精神。</p>
<p>新理事長聞蘭亭氏，耆年宿望，繼唐壽民氏之後出膺艱鉅，其勇於任事之精神，實不可及。所望就職以後，調整內部，嚴密監督所屬，使統制工作日見完善，社會民生日趨安定，豈僅統制辦法得以日漸取信於社會，抑亦民生之大幸！</p>

<h3>中國青年之進路</h3>
<p>— 友松圓諦</p>
<p>本月六日在國立上海大學講</p>
<p>日本於今後十年問，將會控制英美而確保南方的責源的吧。為者那十年間與今後的五十年間，日木必與友邦中國　續對英美進行經濟戰爭。中國將為自己之需要與對亞洲五億人的市塲，進而成為一生產者。英美的金元與金鎊，必須把它完全騙出「大東亞」。因此，巾日必須協力從事於生產。食糧方面，中國與滿洲國尤其是要飛　的　高其能率。轉工業與重工業，都必須加以開拓。所以今後中國的靑年，應該從日本學習科學興技術。希望諸君能多努力於物理，科學，數學，這些自然科學方面。上海有日本國立的自然科學研究所，這是諸君所應該加以利用的。</p>
<p>我有一個與上海市政府有關係的友人，曾對我說過這樣的話：一我以前就從事於蝶的　集，但因中國的友人們陸續地送來，所以我和那方面的英集家好像變成為兄弟似的。」這種話是適用於一切的學問研究的。在自然科學上，並沒有國境和民族。二加二等於四，在任何國都是一樣。水的成分之化學方程式，在日本和中國都沒有變化。中國的大學生諸君，因為以年少氣銳而從事於政治運動，所以常有不祥的事件發生。受着一部份政治家口頭宣傳的煽動，這是不能呌做大學生的。因為那是自覺不足，和學問研究尚淺之故。中日的大學生如果能在自然科學及共通性最多的精神科學上互相協力，必定會使大東的文化向上的吧。</p>
<p>就我自己來說，我所專門研究的，是佛教的學問。尤其是佛教的歷史之研究，而且是研究佛教的經濟思想。在上海附近有着許多的寺院，那些寺院的組織與其經濟制度及思想，是其有興味的。這無渝是中國，是日木乃至其本土的印度，都是同樣的。所以我能和這些佛教學者和居士們相唔談，是極愉快的事，而且晤談是極為融洽的。因此在不到一週之間，己經像十年的兄弟那樣親熱了。孫中山先生與初期的中國的政治家們，因為各各的教養很　，所以連政治上也頗能　到中日的協力。孫中山先生所能做到的中日協力，而其弟子們的一部分反而不能做到，這是什麽理由，誰能知道呢？在這一點，我以為大家是應該好好考慮的。尤其希望中國的靑年們加以深深的考慮。</p>
<p>日本在忍耐十年之後，終於向宿敵的英美宣戰，因此中國與日木的關係，也更為明如了。木來這兩國具有同文同種的命運，是早應全面和平協力了的，却被英美始終挑撥離間。可是由於此次「大東亞戰爭宣言」，大東亞共同的敵人在那裹已經明白，所以中日兩國的愈情就繫於這「大東亞」之上了。因此如前所說，潛在於破阻心中的一種崇拜英美的想想也就能夠掃除了。自然，在中國的靑年之中，還看因為英語很好的，或喜歡吃西菜的，或喜織看西洋電影的。尚未能擺脫依賴英美的根性吧。這樣的青年，該說是一種逆着時代的青年。</p>
<p>協力驅逐英美</p>
<p>其中也許有世故較深的現實的靑年會說；英美是強大的國家，他們也許會再來做上海之王的吧，所以我們不可做那輕率的事。」我要說，這樣的想法也不是無理的。但這次不把那強大的英美　逐，它是永久趕不出去的。所以中國和日本協力，把英美自亞洲打出的好機會，今日如果錯過，恐怕是永久沒有了吧。在這大戰爭以中，中國的靑年也是參加了的。但應該採取怎樣的形式來參加戰爭呢？我以為到日木的軍需工塲去學習做工也好，在華中從事食糧增產也好，甚至　助淸鄉工作也好。</p>
<p>今日，日木是為着中國的自主面和英美作戰的，希望大家能忍耐十年。英美國民的精神力能持續十年間的戰爭，我敢斷言，是絕對沒有的。</p>
<p>我的說法，也許因為熱心於中日關係，竟給與一種任性的印象也未可知。但我決不想以日木的好關係來發表隨便的意見。希望大家加以仔細的考慮。在靑年間也許有着崇拜外國和依賴英美之思想的。也許有對於基督教會在中國辦的教育事業，因而將西洋思想加以過大評價的。但被西洋思想所蒙蔽，這是中國之不幸，和成為巾日相背的原因。諸君，雖然知道，孔子之名，但對「論語」似乎並不怎樣珍重。可是無論如何，諸君是中國人，無論如何，巾國人是不能成為西洋人的，到底還是「論語」的民族。而今正是這東洋精神顯揚的時代、諸君今後必須深入於科學的技兩，同時對於儒教，道教，佛教－這些中國文化具有一種自重不可。</p>
<p>今天我在食堂，和一個中國靑年同卓，曾向遇他：譬如有三種人：「一有權力的人，二有財產者，三有高德者，」這三種人你以為那一個偉大呢？你們向，他怎樣回答呢？如果他說前二者之一是偉大的話，那我想要保守沉默；但他卻指了第三者。我於是非常高興地叫着：「中國的精神尚未滅亡」</p>
<p>雖然有人批難中國靑年好作政治運動和功利主義者；但那不過是一部份青年而已。尊重孔子，崇尚論語的中國人，使是尊「德」。這　中國的古典精神是生着的。孫中山先生爲什麽會受青年尊敬呢？孫先生並未留下財產，尤未曾做過獨裁者，那些都沒有的中山先生，只是在清貧而不失其節操之點，受著中國青年門的尊敬，那裏便是中國思想的　在。</p>
<p>二三日前，我在上海廣播電台，請演過「新中國的精神」。我在那時，主張應在中國五千年的古典精神的王道政治的埋念上，來解釋「三民主義」。在靑年們之中，也許有人以為西洋的哲學，政治，經濟，科學是最上的，中國過去的文明在今日已成為不能使用的古董了。而三民主義又被他們當爲經濟的思想似的。三民主義既爲聖賢之道，而今日沒有四書五經之外來創造心得口號之必要了。只是一不留神，則占典使當成爲保守的與形式化了。那不過只是特地把古典的容器重　上一層新的顏色而已。中國真正的精神之登塲，新中國才能誕生。</p>

<h3>限制國民宴會　定下月實施　福利局召集談話會商討辦法</h3>
<p>社會福利部爲　應戰時體制，勵行節約，藉以儲備物資，增進國力起見，特制定戰時國民宴會限制綱要，呈經行政院及最高國防會議通過，並由國民政府公佈施行，茲以國民宴會在上海一市，最爲奢侈，每日爲宴會消耗浪費物資，其數實可驚人，故對上海方面施行限制國民宴會，尤爲亟需。昨（十五）日特由上海特別市社會福利局邀請本市有關機關社團報館，及酒菜館方面代表，於下午三時在該局會議室舉行談話會，商討實施辦法，社會福利部長了默邨氏以因公在滬，亦被邀臨時參加致訓。茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>談話會議</p>
<p>計到丁部長默邨，陳處長東白外，及市府代表　靖字，孫一社會福利局長嗚　，胡主任秘書壽祺，及各科科長，第一區公署代表王以義，經濟局代表萬樹煌，第一警局代表鄒欽明，第二警局代表錢選，各社團代表計到市商會吳介玉，節約協會任　鵬，曁本市酒菜陀業同業公會代表劉松濤，鄒華淸，西菜館榮同業公會代表楊榮悟等，首由孫局長主席，報吿召集意義，深盼發抒高見，切實推行。繼山丁部長默邨致訓，旋由簡約協會代表任雲鵬發表意見，對於此次政府推行戰時國民宴會之限制，在民間立塲，當應切實遵行，深盼富局在今後嚴厲執行，期上海方面奢侈風氣，則以整飭。旋由酒菜館業公會代表劉松濤對政府之苦心，莫不深爲感動，今後當遵令施行。後決定國民宴會限制，定於七月一日起，開始實行，次對於節約菜之限制價格，今後由社會福利局會同經濟局核定後，呈奉市府施行。</p>
<p>丁部長詞</p>
<p>丁部長訓詞要點：　節約係提倡儉僕，儉樸對個人方面說是一種美德，所謂「儉以養廉」，以國家而論，則可充實國力，在平時旣屬需要，在戰時爲儲備物資，培養戰力，尤爲急要。　節約的反面是奮侈浪費，社會間奢侈浪費的事情很多，其最爲顯著者，莫過於宴會，所謂「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨」，「富家一席酒，窮人半年糧」，宴會之奢侈浪費，自古已然，於今爲烈，故社會福利部對於實施節約，即從社會間最普遍而又最浪費的宴會着手，經制定限制國民宴會綱要，公佈施行，並以上海方面此種不必要之宴會最多，故對上海實施限制宴會，尤爲重視。　　看盛宴，一席萬金，在上海己成普遍現象，非特浪費物資，暴殄天物，即對個人衛生，亦未必有益，且或有人對於應酬宴會，認爲畏事者，然則宴會之意義何在，究其原因，實爲請客者一種虛僞心理之反映，認爲非豐肴不足以示敬，非盛宴不足以稱闊，所謂派頭甚大，彼此效尤，競尚奢華，相習遂成風氣，故實施節約宴會，首應打破此種心理，以豐肴盛宴爲可恥，與可卑，人人信守，慢慢地即可改變過來。　在此戰時，任何國家對於節約無不重視，尤其日本國民，其生活嚴肅，刻苦自勵之精神，實可欽佩，以視我國國民之浮華淫靡，誠屬慚愧，故國民政府對於實施節約，列爲戰時社會政策重耍施策之一，希望全體協力一致奉行，光從限制宴會做起，以期普遍實現，是爲幸甚。</p>
<p>限制綱要</p>
<p>最高國防會議及行政院會議通過之戰時國民宴會限制綱要，今舉其要點誌次：　關於冥誕，遷居，訂婚，安葬，及六十歲以下之書辰情事，經對不准設宴款客。　戰時國民宴會菜看，務極簡單，不得採用奢侈高貴物品，如魚翅燕窩熊掌鮑魚等，杷對不得採用。　戰時宴會巾菜以每席十人爲原則，每席菜肴包括大小冷熱湯甜鹹諸味，不得超過八　，但逾十人，每增一人，得添菜一　，木足八人時，不得用整席菜肴。　規定菜看以外，如不備飯者，得加點心一道，備飯者不得再備點心。　如係西菜，每客除咖啡水菓外，不得超過四色。　中菜每席，西榮每客價格，由各地酒菜館榮同榮公會議決，在特別市呈請經濟局社會福利局，在縣市呈請縣市政府核定後公布之。　絕對不得置備洋酒供客酌飲，如係午宴，應以茶代酒，任何酒　均禁止飲用。　各地酒菜館如有違反本綱要之規定者，依下列各款處罰之，（第一次）警吿，（第二次）處以五百元至五干元之罰銀，（第三次）處以三天至七天之停業，在三次以上者，吊銷其營業執照。</p>
<h3>請領運米護照　以逾數十萬石　滬食未來源漸見暢旺</h3>
<p>本市自經當局准許五斗以上十石以下之食米自由搬運後，連日一般米販，向米糧統制委員會請求發給臨時擭照，以及米商申請向各地採購食米護照者，均極踴躍，其數量已逾數十萬石，對於蔬運採辦各方，均予以極天便利，而該項食米現已在啓運中，不日當可抵滬。又該會爲精密熱計搬入滬市食米數量，籍供研究今後對策假見，每日派員分赴各搬入口作實地調查統計，每日數量約萬石左右，故來源尚稱暢旺。</p>
<h3>粉麥專業委員會　正辦理結束</h3>
<p>商統會粉麥專業委員會業經行政院特令孫仲立爲主任委員，井上泰忠爲副主仟委員『據悉該會已在積極辦理前任事務結東，改組後之內部組織機精，已由該會討綸決定，並已草擬本年度粉麥統收統配實施具體方案，呈請行政院核示中。聞該會爲使粉麥收配業務繼續推進起見，値此改組甲，對於收買工作照常進仃，除大麥元麥已派員爲飭各地區麥行及委托商進行收買外，對於將近登場之新小麥收買業務，一俟統收統配實施方案呈奉行政院核准後，即行着于實施收買。</p>
<h3>遊民勞動營籌募經費</h3>
<p>社會福利部上海特別市政府，鑒於本市遊民地痞，觸目皆是，損害市容，破壞治安，至深且鉅，特籌組上海遊民勞動營，收容游民，加以敎養感化，並强制勞動，藉資從事生產。茲以該項籌組經費，爲數甚巨，特海上海特別市商會，請函各業同業公會，曁銀行錢莊，工廠公司，行號，慨予捐輸，其籌募辦法，探誌於后：凡本市各同業公會　銀行，錢莊，工廠公司，行號，一次認捐二千元者爲甲級，一千元爲乙級，五百元爲丙級，資本在一千萬以上者，一次認捐一萬元至十萬以上，所認捐款，概由各該業同業公會代收，收據則由該籌備處分發，收款後每隔二日解人指定銀行，並將存根送交該處，轉送各報披露，所右捐款，限於六月底繳齊。</p>
<h3>敵機來滬偵察　市民應加緊防空</h3>
<p>十二十三兩日侵晨，敵機曾飛至南京及上海地區偵察，惟日軍警戒嚴密，敵機並無動靜，即吿遁去，日軍防衛當局昨就此事指出下列幾點，促市民深切注意。</p>
<p>在華美空軍，最近受日本航空部隊極大打擊，致目前竭力避免與日軍正面衝突，專企圖航空游擊作戰　人後方。　十二十三兩日，敵機竄人上海四周地區，故發出警報，當時上海市民之防空熊勢，由於不斷訓練護得效果，態度極爲冷靜沈着，此使常局感到安心。　目下敵機活動僅屬偵察飛行，但敵機爲發揮神經戰的效果，今後有展開航空游擊戰之虞，市民對防空須更加努力，尤應力成受流言　感，中敵奸計，再對於燈火管制亦切勿廢馳。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>應付戰時環境</h3>
<p>今天有兩段消息，應該注意：　敵機來滬偵察，市民應加騷防空。　嚴禁旅社，午夜作戰。</p>
<p>這兩段消息，雖則是不同的兩件事，可是，我們認爲有着關聯的意義。</p>
<p>第一，敵機來滬偵察，己經當局指出市民應加注意之點。在此決戰隋段，敵機話動，原是意料中事，無所用其驚　。而對於燈火管制，則應特別注意。市民必須明暸，燈火管制的目的，就是各自維護安全，旣爲自身的安全，自應各自注意。</p>
<p>第二，禁止旅社午夜雀戰，我們認爲早應澈底嚴禁。而其範圍不限於旅社，更應普通及於俱樂部及居家等等。雀戰是賭博，費時勞神，損錢耗電，無論從燈火管制，節約電力，實踐戰時生活的任何觀點，都須　爲干禁。僅此細枝末節尚不能澈底禁止，實愧言戰時生活</p>
<p>上海是戰時都市，目而面臨決戰階段，上海市當局與市民共同應付戰時環境，注意防空，注意燈火管制，對於一切違背戰時環境，妨碍防空的所謂「夜娛樂」，常局應逐一禁絕，市民應共同自肅。</p>
<h3>老閘分局　破獲小型賭台　各犯解地檢署究辦</h3>
<p>市政富局爲刷新大上海市容，抱最大決心，對南市賭窟已於三月二十九日予以對閉，然一般賭棍，竟敢混入第一區內秘密聚賭，雷斯流動賭台，第一警察局早經注意，令飭各芬局查緝在案，老閘分局於前（十二日）接獲報吿，有張偉南於雲南路二〇七衖內設置小型賭台，聚衆賭博，抽頭漁利，當由該分局長賀德惠令司法股主任劉俊卿派探前往拘捕，適若輩正在呼么喝六中，當塲拘獲頭家張偉南，及賭徒賈福根，陳鍚榮，郭關六，鍾秋榮，蘇　芳，陸覺英，劉文卿，譚孝，局德壽，羅禮芬，許家，羅華，周達啓，李國華等十五人，經帶局審訊一過，對聚賭均供認不諱，當解地檢署偵察後移解法院，依法究辦。</p>
<p>嚴禁旅社午夜雀戰</p>
<p>又該分局因確切維護治安，嚴禁旅館旅各深夜雀戰高歌，以維安寗，業經正式通令各旅社，在斯長期燈火管制期間，限定旅客於午夜十二時後不得再有妨害安寗秩序之舉，（如以竹雀牌敵打遊戲及其他聚衆喧嘩，高聲放歌足以妨書他人安寗等情事，）如旅客有不聽禁止者，由各旅社負責人報吿帶局依照遠警罰法第三十五條予以拘役五天處分示儆，倘不報吿時經查護者，各旅館負責人，亦遽帶負責，依法處罰。</p>
<h3>被拘不法商人　暫行保釋</h3>
<p>本市第一警察局經濟保安處成立以來，對經濟保安事宜，積極推進，對各業不法份子，囤積居奇，操縱物價，以及各商店之擅抬物價，非法牟利悄事，嚴密調查，予以取締，日來曾數度拘獲油。頟料·米·南貨·北貨·以及各生要日用品等之不半商人二百五十餘人，徑審查認火部份關係輕微，絡績覓妥保人，出立保證書暫行保釋，惟一方面仍予偵查各人經營行爲。又該感對各業尚淸，繼績密切調查，有否奸人作祟，有者當予拘捕究辦，俾抑平物價，而安民生。</p>
<h3>衛生運動大會　昨日圓滿結束　袁局長發表感想</h3>
<p>本市衛生運動大會經衛生當局籌劃，經於本月一日開始活動，各項工作，均經指導保里服務人員，普率市民按期推行，成績甚佳，　展覽會方面，以體驗會選次賽馬賽球，致未能使市民普遍參觀，旋經富局核准展綫至本月十五日截止，該會經半月之展覧，統計參觀市民三十萬人以上，收效甚宏，該會展覽會昨吿圓滿結束。衛生局袁局長，就此次衛生運動大會，發表感想如下：</p>
<p>衛生運動大會之目的，旨在喚起一般市民之淸潔觀念，重視公共衛生，亦即衛生敎育之具體表現，本市此次舉行衛生運動大會，原定於五月十五日舉行，嗣本局以本市歷屆舉行衛生運動大會，僅限於舊市區，現在租界收回，市政統一，自應統一辦理，旋經決定與第一區合併舉行，衛生運動大會不得不延期舉行，而本市衛生運動之各項活動，於第一區方面同時推動，實爲有史以米之倡見。各項活動，雖以天時氣候關係，然尚可差强人意，展覽會方面，値此非常時期財力物力，均感不逮，且尚有抓種右關公共衛生之模型標本等件，有因戰事失散，一時未及趕製，難免殘缺不全，至本區各穗化騐等衛生設施狀况，僅爲乘此機會介紹於市民瞭解，並且希望市民合作，嗣後無論關於防投揹施，及物品檢查等事，盡可依法辦理，勿稍觀望，以保市民健康。惟本市衛生運動，統計前後已舉行十餘次，而市民妨　衛生之事，仍屢見不鮮，足見尚未達衛生敎育之目的，故今後本局對於衛生敎育之推行，木局長當督率主管科積極推廣。至冬季衛生運動大會，當依照軍央規定於十二月十五日舉行，展覽方面，以及各種活動，今後即常籌備，則下屆大會當更爲充實，此次衛生運動大會荷蒙各機關長官，及各界協助，木會深表感謝，今後並盼各界隨時合作，以使本市衛生更臻至善，市民健康賴以保陣，這是本人十二萬分熱誠盼望的。</p>
<h3>盧局長就任六週年紀念</h3>
<p>本市第二警察局局長盧英，自任職以來，業已六年，地方治安，頓以確保，昨（十五）日上午十時該局全體人員及所屬各分局長，特在該局大禮堂內，舉行就任六週年紀念儀式，甚爲隆重。</p>
<h3>體育　今晚助學余籃球義賽　中西靑決賽　另增男子健美表演</h3>
<p>本報助學金籃球賽，由中西靑兩大勁旅作三賽二勝之決鬥，兩隊現各勝一次，造成均等局面，今晚八時正作最後之決戰，仍在中靑健身房交鋒，賽半另有健美男子表演，山新近獲得一中靑健美男子比賽」首三名之柳　庵，黃輝，及茅冠卿參加演出，必多精彩鏡頭，同時並將作拍賣義球之舉，以厚收人。查中靑策華聯藥，仁除，及油隊之精銳，戰將如雲，人材濟濟，首二塲蘇以華聯或仁餘單獨出戰，今夜則決全部混合出塲，作車輪大戰，勝負有關國際間榮譽，定當全力以赴，西靑在第二仗中充分發揮其實力，今晚三度會師，雙方必各傾全力一決雌雄，賽畢給獎閉幕。</p>
<p>中靑　余　子，孔廣益（隊長），瞿錫麟，范慶公，張錦瑛，吳成章，張良雄，張顯器，卓國榮，馬燦希，林維總，李肇和，何金貴，陳淸江，唐學聲。</p>
<p>西靑　凱捷密洛夫（隊長）陶森林基，浮尼克，勃脫，耶龍，大沙司金，小沙司金，奧柴遼。</p>
<h3>福利足球賽　賬目公佈</h3>
<p>社會福利都主辦各種福利事業，向由該部撥款補助，藉以維持，近因物價高漲，開支陡增，對事業之維持，愈感困難，各事業機關均紛紛呈請該部增加經費，爰經該部丁部長商請上海足球聯合會會長沈嗣良，副會長潘三省，乘津聯足球隊來滬之便，舉行福利足球賽，需募福利經費，經於六月三日，由足球會邀請津　與東華兩隊，在跑馬廳舉行，滬上各界人士熱　贊助，是日觀眾之多，實所罕見。一般估計二百元座當在二萬人以上，惟結果二百元座實售僅九千三百十八張，與實際人數相差甚遠，究其原因實緣是日觀衆情緒過分熱烈，且爲數過多，雖賴等警協力，秩序仍不易維持，有欲購票而無從購買者，亦有未購門票而乘機湧入者，致無票觀衆，竟達半數以上。綜結此次福利賽收支賬目　八張，計款一百八十六萬三千六百元，一千元券售出二〇三張，計款二十萬三千元，二萬元榮譽券售出四十張，計款八十萬元，另自動捐款三萬元，總計門票收入及自動捐款共二百八十九萬六千六百元，惟榮譽券尚有二十六萬元未會收齊，正在催收，其自動捐款者及購買二萬元座券姓氏，日內當在各報披露，藉伸謝忱，至用途之支配，亦當俟商定後，日內公佈。再據社會福利部負責人表示，此次福利球賽雖有半數以上觀衆未曾勝票，致收入大受影響，但觀衆情緒熱烈，重視體育，憲警維持秩序，極爲盡力，東華隊及津聯隊球藝精彩，跑馬廳與足球聯合會全體職員出動協助，均深可感謝。</p>
<p>昨日發報時間六點五十分</p>

<h3>印緬空戰的特徵</h3>
<p>最近的印緬航空戰，其特微之一便是敵方使職鬥機擔任作戰的主要角色。海種作戰要素的變遷，其原因可認為是在進入今日這種航空要塞時代的階段後，敵軍雖用向稱最擾秀　轟炸機的統一式的特B24及波因17B級實行空襲，也因日軍防空陣容的堅强，所得的轟炸效果及所期的損害，簡直微乎其微。若果如此，則今日的現象可視之為在他們的轟炸機有更勝於今日的進步以前的臨時現象。</p>
<p>畏懼日機威力</p>
<p>敵軍在行將來臨的雨委試作何種出擊，現在雖不得而知，但他們的戰鬥機時代其本身對於他們亦有作戰上的重要意義和價値，這在他們目前及將來的航空戰術思想和作戰指空襲主體的B24，以去歲十二月一日的仰光空襲爲最後，除利用夜晚或陰天而出擊以外，早就完全退出了白畫空襲的大舞台。至其理由，有如下列：</p>
<p>敵軍現用轟炸機如為巡航速度五百公里以下，實用上异限度一萬二千公尺以下的轟炸機，則無論其裝甲如何厚，武裝如何强，決非日軍戰鬥機的敵手，此為其性能上的限界。</p>
<p>縱用戰鬥縱護衛，亦因日軍邀繫戰鬥機的威力遠較强大，反足牽累護衛戰鬥機的行動，頗有同歸於盡之懼。</p>
<p>即使不惜犧牲，對於防衛堅固的目標，亦不能期待有多大的效果。</p>
<p>由於電波探知機的登塲，奇襲簡直不可能。以上即其戰術上的限界。要之，縱然用P31P38地等掩護B24，也難以突破仰光等地的細甸防空陣綫</p>
<p>美英戰鬥,機的性能</p>
<p>這樣，所謂戰鬥機時代是出現了。尤其在本年三月上旬以來，更無異是戰鬥機萬能時代。從搭載多量炸彈進攻遠處，一舉炸毀要地的理想而言，戰門機本不及轟炸機，但在以邀擊戰門機為主體而動員各種防空兵器的今日，要突入航空要塞圈的話，現用機種除戰鬥機以外是不能期望過奢的。因為戰鬥機由共較優的速度和運動性，迥　對方戰鬥機的邀擊或與之戰門，都屬可能；進一步更可分頭覓取疏散的各個目極，加以各個繫破。就最近敵機出擊的實際狀况看，來襲包含富貢地區阿拉坎地區的全細戰彌的敵機，每日累計約一百數十架，其九成是戰門機。此種代替轟炸機而成為遠距離鎚攻主體的戰鬥機，以美國洛基特P38，北美P51為多，其次則為英國的噴火機，僕法伊泰等。</p>
<p>這些皆屬敵方號稱優秀的戰門機，P38全載重量大噸餘，時速最大五入〇公里，憎用上昇限度九干公尺餘，裝有一二〇七　機關槍四挺，三七　機關砲一門，續航距離一千四百公里（最大三千五百公里），備有一一五〇馬力發動機二麼，是雙發胴機。P51的最大時速為六〇〇公里，實用上昇限度一萬一千四百公尺，續航距離一千四百公里，裝有一二·七糧機關槍六挺，阿里遜液冷式一一六〇匹馬力發動機一座。噴火九型戰鬥機時速最大六〇〇公里，上昇高度一萬二千公尺，續航距離八〇〇公里，武器有七·七　機關槍四挺，二〇　機關飽二門，發動機爲洛爾斯。路易士液冷式，是一萬公尺的高航戰門機。（以上所述各機性能，均根據敵方的發表。）</p>
<p>編隊形式改變</p>
<p>如上所述，這些戰鬥機的速度和火力皆已增加，上昇及高空性能亦　稱優秀，但續航距離極短，從而他們必須利用轟炸機不易停留的最前線的基地。吉大港·希爾基亞。伊姆法爾·丁蘇基挨地區等，似為他們侵攻作戰最有力的基地，而其出擊的目標，則以日軍航空基地為主。到三四月頃為止，通常以P38或P51等十架左右的編隊分批來襲。P51以超低空飛行侵入，用機關槍向地上掃射，宛如噴壼酒水。其攻擊普通為一日一次。但人五月以後，也門約戰雲似乎有了若干變化。</p>
<p>此因　日軍邀擊所生的損害每比他們的預料為多，　由於日本飛機生產的迅速加强及補給的圓滑，日軍戰力日益充實增强，他們　予日方的損害過輕。他們注意到這樣的結果時，認為如欲减殺日軍航空勢力，非以擊落日機為第一義而展開空戰不可。所以他們除照舊用十架左右的一種戰鬥機編隊對地攻擎以外，復採取用數種戰門機分組混合編隊，在上層的戰鬥機專門担任空中戰門的戰法。五月十一日對中部緬魚〇〇地區的空襲，其編隊那分為三層，由P38（底空）·P51（高空）·英國噴火機（中空）三種戰鬥機數十架編成。而其攻擊木必一次即了，往往隔不多時又來空襲，採用所謂波狀攻擊。又因電波兵器的普及與戰鬥機的輕快性，他們似欲即應火氣及日方狀况　化而實行臨機應變的攻擊。然而遭種企圖反因日軍變幻自在的絕妙作戰法而結果成為徒然　於奔命。</p>
<p>日新銳機活躍</p>
<p>上面所述的爲進人所　戰鬥機時代後敵空軍反攻戰術的槪要，但返觀緬甸方面日本空軍的作戰，則轟炸機並未退出攻擊部隊，依然勇戰，發揮轟烽機本來的面目，此即由於日軍航空部隊審愼奧妙的作戰用兵，日機旺盛的攻擊精神，以及務良卓越的戰技。但日軍轟炸機的進攻現在不像過去容易，這事實亦須承認，而期待於戰門機會的任務比過去為大也是事實。過去的馬猶作戰中，以及現在的伊姆法爾作戰和對付空中挺身部隊的作戰中，日本新銳戰鬥機隊的偉大活動，在者意味下是我們應該特別注意的。</p>
<p>再則，在其後方不斷至產補充的今日，對於英美，在航空作戰上使其飛機及乘員同歸於盡，實為航空擊滅戰的絕對必要條件。在這意味下，由進攻和邀擊而展開的航空擊滅戰，意義顯然增大。最近緬甸各地。空軍邀擊作戰所護擊勝敵機多架的戰要，並不劣於進攻，必須認議。</p>
<p>最後，目前展開的劇烈航空決戰中，數量的重要固無須　論，但決定最後的勝敗者，無論怎樣，總是乘員的素質和飛機的性能，此點必須切記。（泰特派員）譯自五月二十一日「朝日新聞」）</p>
<h3>英法海峽視察記</h3>
<p>英法海峽的空氣，因英美的準備侵歐戰而頓吿緊張。英美侵人軍的出發點，即在一衣帶水的對岸。在這狹隘的海面間担任着重要任務的，有一種高速魚雷艇。這可說是海中的戰車，裝甲完全，機械精良。時速〇〇節，蹴波如飛，兩舷裝載巨大魚雷。雖接近敵人時，亦不易被覺察。</p>
<p>英法海峽深僅五。六十米，潛水艦不能活動，乃有此種高速魚雷艇的出現。自一九四二年七月起，至去年底止，不足兩年，已擊沈商船百七十六艘（五十一萬四千噸），驅逐艦四，哨戒艇六，浮船塢一，補助艦一。</p>
<p>最近英法海峽中攻防戰的情形，在英美軍登陸聲中，極為堅張。最有力的敵方基地如普利茅斯，藤榮普敦，樸資茅斯，倫敦等地海岸綫，佈優着嚴密的醫戒棧，每三天從泰語士河出來入至十般的護送船團，有驅逐艦二至四服，砲艦約十艘守護着，前面有哨戒艇五·六艘，掃海艇三。四艘開路。最近為對抗德國的高速魚雷艇，在海峽中央泊有內燃機砲艦與蒸氣機砲艦，遮斷其進擊路綫。</p>
<p>這內燃機飽船長三十五米，排水量僅一百噸，速力三十入節，備有四糧機關砲二門，二　機關砲一門，一糎半二聯裝機槍二挺。蒸氣機砲艦長約五十米，排水量二百嘲，速力三十九節，主碗有八·八　口徑二門，完全是驅逐艦式，此均為機國魚雷艇的大敵。且在實際戰爭上，其火力與連力，並稱優趙。</p>
<p>最近此種艦艇被德國魚雷艇擊沉五艘，德魚雷艇僅在基地被轟炸而損害一艘，此亦足以說明德國海軍勇士在夜問襲繫時視力的優劣。總而言之，這是勇往直前的攻擊精神與大膽的奇襲戰法之結果。</p>
<p>磐石之安的大西洋要塞</p>
<p>呼應海上攻擎的陸上邀擊態勢，今幾已完成。有名的「大西洋防壁」，有無數要塞蜿蜓不絕。每一個堡壘之中，可聞激烈的訓練之聲，突出的巨砲飽口，隨時可以活動，以要塞為中心機關槍座，兵房都建築在地下，上面是綠色的草地，開着花的園圃。此外更有重重的鐵絲網，地雷原，後方。側面都安設着巨砲，以防降落傘部隊襲擊要塞。</p>
<p>敵人懼怕這難以動搖的氣魄並且明知攻擊是無效的，故敵機縱在高空飛來，也決不敢父戰。與英國本土最近的距雖，雖祗有十幾分鐘的空路，但在這西歐要塞的突出點，還沒有發生空中的決戰。然而在不見蹤影的高空中飛行的敵機，這天也被德國的沿岸高射炮擊落數架，其餘也均被擊退。</p>
<p>敵人見到這鐵壁般的德國防禦陣勢，却又感到不受侵略不被威脅的和平氣氛，海上的挺身勇士從這二年間的偵察眼光判斷起來，不信敵八已集結了百來個師團，且海上勢力也絕沒有集結刊能夠登陸決戰的程度。</p>
<p>當然，强渡海峽祇　五小時半就够了，但行動前的準備則須中小時。德國每在在準備着這種襲繫。陸上在嚴密監視着敵人，用巨彈的火網覆蔽着盡岸的海面。敵艦船在海峽對岸無論怎樣秘密行動，不能逃過電液探知器的耳目。這種新兵器今日愈見進步，英海軍登陸前在艦船的　側貼上軟木片，或湧入工霧，都不能逃過這超短波的透視。</p>
<p>降落傘的勢力，也似乎估許得太大了。至多不過四，五個師團。用此勢力，縱能擾亂後方，如不能與海上取得聯絡，殲滅可說是時間問題。要之，敵人蹤能侵入法國，也以二十四小時內殲滅之為原則。且事實上，至少在英法海峽要實行奇襲登陸作戰是絕對不可能的。</p>
<p>英美恃其飛機，武器與兵力的數量而計劃的策略與宣傳，不是空想，是有危險性的。自狄埃浦登陸作戰失敗以來，歷經北非登陸戰，義大利作戰等役，英美軍的登陸作戰，已累積了相當年期，支付了極大的犧牲。他們亟欲侵入歐洲以結束戰爭，故積極從事侵攻準備。（翔：譯自五月二十八日東京朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>馬來實行增產運動</h3>
<p>東京十五日小央社電　馬來日軍政監，會於此間會見記者團。就順應日前之作戰及强化軍事施策問題談話如次：關於馬來食糧問題，本年度將以完全自驚自足為目標，展開全面增產運動，開墾荒地，利用空地，原住民均能深體當局意旨，熱心協力。關於米之輸入，最近亦頗呈活潑，原住民已毫無不安之情勢，於再建馬來之現階段下，勞不充足問題，巳為當前極天課題，勞工之不足，乃為建設方面全面不能進展之一左證。他方面義勇軍之大批增員，亦爲勞工不足之一原因，因此本年度已決定除自爪　移入數千名勞工外，更有全面推行勞務動員計調之必要。關於華僑對策根本方針，業已決定，目下　先開到彼等積極支持協力，蓋彼等之經濟實力更有在發展之可能，對彼等之自由活動，現已予以協助，使彼等於經濟方面自由活動，當局方面對此，亦行積極指導。關於物價問題，本年度預定貸出數億元，但於目前為防止通貨膨脹，於金融方面加以種種統制，規定資金之貸出，並對過剩購買法。又最近銀行存款，郵政儲金均激增，此實為一可喜之現象，可謂為住民信賴日方之一大左證。</p>

<h3>窗前的鴿影</h3>
<p>— 劉嘉淦</p>
<p>每天，總有這麼一羣鴿子，在空中飛着，飛着。從對弄的　台後面出現，經過那狹弄的上空，掠過我住房的屋脊，就在附近的屋頂上打一個圈子，於是又在對弄的　合上出現了。她們就這樣終天不歇地打着圈兒…現在，當牠們每次掠過我的窗前時，我的眼前便現在幾點靈活的黑影，而胸中便像加了塊鉛石般的沉重呵！</p>
<p>認得一月以前，情形却是完全兩探的，機們曾給我以無限的快慰。那時前樓還住着我一個朋友，兩人整天默默天讀着，寫着。這是多麼單調的生活啊！我們的精神是這樣急切的需要外界的事物來調劑。但是，我們到那衷去找這樣的事勿尼？窗外沒有對也沒有花，就是一顆小草吧，也無法尋到。天井很小，又一堆堆地堆滿了陳腐破爛的什物，迆一個人踱踱方步的地方也沒有了。於是我們發現了那羣鴿子，雖然牠們的飛翔是無聲的，不惹人注意的。每天兩人總是有一個時間並坐在窗前，抬起頭，望着那羣鴿子鍬來飛去地翱翔，一天的波勞便從我的身心上留走，而有一種種種然的感覧。</p>
<p>有一天，我的朋友突然跳起來，他堅決地說：</p>
<p>「我不能再困在籠子似的地方，　望着他們了！</p>
<p>幾大之後，他帶着簡單的行李離開了前樓，自由翱翔去了吧。只留下我，每天抬頭癡　地　着那羣鴿子，感慨地自語着！</p>
<p>「哦！牠們喚起過多少年官人的雄心呵，！」</p>
<p>但是，我的雄心總是無法勾引起來，一陳慚愧的心理使我不願再見到牠們，我巴望牠們永榆在窗前絕跡。但這却使我又回憶起往事來：就在幾個月以前罷，對弄的　台上有兩個孩十，拿着橡皮帶做成的彈弓，用着小石礫，向鴿羣漫射，驚得牠們撲僕地亂飛，竟有好多時不敢低迥飛翔，並且還在更改變牠們飛行的路綫。我們那時候極為忿怒，曾經借了偶然落進來的一地　子為由，大起交涉。後來，鴿子的飛翔又恢復了常態－－低低地掠窗而過。這時二人的心中都感到一陣滿足。誰知道，在幾個月之後，我竟不願見到牠們了。</p>
<p>老天似乎在威人之美，一連幾天大雨，牠們也不得不在空中絕跡。本來我應該滿足了，但是我的心反開始覺得空虛起來。嚴子喪沒有一個人願意同我這樣一個性情乖僻的人談話；架上雖有幾本書，但是在這樣陰晦的天氣，看了只有呌人發悶。桌上也放有筆硯，但只一掃上筆握就覺得腦子遲鈍起來，寫不到一行又擱下了。於是我立起來，來回地　展着。上海的生活是　雜的，但是在兩天都是異樣的情景。前樓的門關着，後面的牌寺，被大雨的淅淅聲遮沒了。那滴滴的雨聲在我的耳中已覺習慣了簡直有些漠然，我那朋友的舖板還放在屋角裏，我不敢去正視牠，祇有望着灰色的天空發怔。我走近窗口，那狹長的弄堂，那　比的房屋靜靜地　在我的眼前，往日那種醜　古怪的樣子已在茫茫中消失，儀死一般的靜默着。這沉默刺痛了我的心，胸內的空虛漸漸擴大起來，形成了一個無底無邊的深窟</p>
<p>－－我不得不想起那羣鴿子了。</p>
<p>終於，牠們不想起那照中重又出現，我不禁從坐椅中跳起來，走近窗口，默默地為牠們禱吿着：</p>
<p>願牠們永遠自由不停地飛翔着。他們是神的使者；牠們給與懦弱的人們以希望和安慰；同時牠們也給與剛强的人們以雄心和勇氣。願牠永遠在自由的天空中翱翔，願牠們那種活潑的姿態能賜與人們以智慧，語心靈的純潔。</p>
<p>直到現在，牠們仍舊一樣，每天每天地循着牠們以常軌飛着，飛着。而我呢，也從不再說不願意看到牠們了！</p>
<p>但是，現在終於和從前的心情不同了。每天，當我坐在窗前看着牠們在面前掠過的時候－那黑影一閃一閃地，我的臉上便堆起了苦笑，而我的心中却似加了一塊鉛石，是那末地沉重呵！－。</p>

<h3>父親老了</h3>
<p>— 儀宣</p>
<p>父親老了嗎？我不敢相信；如果說四十歲是人一生事業的開始，那末五十歲九如日之方中，我翻視着父親過去的照片和日記，那英俊的神容，那奮發的生活，在在都使我否認父親是老了。</p>
<p>然而事實告訴我，無論他的外表，他的思想，他的意志，什麼都如夕陽的殘輝。</p>
<p>是誰促使他？艱困的歲月嗎？，不，時勢能造英雄，英雄儀什麼不能造時勢呢？我以為，是父親的頹廢蒼老了自己。</p>
<p>當第一根白髮出現在他的頭上時，他就憂愁嘆息：「我老了，沒有用了」！於是第二第三，…就迅速地不滿了他的兩鬢；他更憂愁嘆息：「我老了！沒有用了！雨奮門了一世，我該　旗息鼓了！</p>
<p>是一個防空之夜，燈上垂下了紅布裏黑布面的套子，只有桌面上能承受到燈光，父親又彈起了舊調；我說：</p>
<p>「你並沒老，如果我　　到了父親的年紀…「我站起身來，拉去了燈套：「那末，我就憑我的學識與經歷，如這燈光照邊整個的屋子。」</p>
<p>他微笑者無力地長嘆一聲：「唉，孩子話，假使你到了我的年紀，也許還捕入我呢！」</p>
<p>「不，記事我活到比父親還大一倍的年紀時，我也決不　老，也許我的身體是　僂了，我的　是禿了；然而我絕不讓我的精神，我的思想增加十年年紀。」</p>
<p>「你可曾見過不老的肉體；不逝的靑春？父親！你該振作起來，你還是一個　冠三軍的先鋒，現在你是降服，不是光榮的停戰。」</p>
<p>可是我的滔滔長辯，換得的還是一聲：「我老了！沒有用了！」</p>
<p>誰能吿訴我西王母的靈山在那裏？讓我去乞得一服不老的仙丹，奉父親以童顏童心。</p>
<h3>黃昏</h3>

<p>黃昏映著墓前低泣者追憶導我者風貌浮動在幻影中，談吐低低背誦著過去假使患了結核是－我毀滅我以後底餘日，葉　裏超過極量的－是毒劑原素，自殺媒介，聽！誰在這黃昏呻為杜鵑啼般淒涼，是墓前低泣者，</p>

<p>一堆黃土，</p>

<p>影評</p>
<h3>從小說到電影的「紅樓夢」</h3>
<p>— 古辛</p>
<p>…「紅樓夢」終於上銀幕了，據說「華影」為　製這一張影片，曾費了很大的人力物力，事前既大事宣傳，公映後又出了好多種特刊。</p>
<p>…「紅樓夢」是一部以暴露封建貴族家庭種種奢侈淫佚，終至趨於沒落為主題的長篇小。雖然限於時代，寫作底形勢不免流於濫調，它底有點是描述底清幽細膩，人物底栩栩如生。歐美各國常把名者搬上舞台或銀幕，從藝術底觀點，把這部作物介紹給電影觀衆也不是一件絕無價値的事。</p>
<p>…然而改編這一工作，並不容易，旣不許損害原著，又須具有一種適當的獨特的藝術手腕。這次的「紅檔夢」影片，不敢恭維，完全是慘敗的。</p>
<p>…「紅樓夢」影片只採取了原著中實玉黛玉寶釵間三角戀愛底一條長機，而冠以「對舊式婚姻制度作一當頭棒喝」的口號，這是第一個取巧。可是一個漏洞給忘了：原作者底時代根本還沒有所謂「舊式婚姻」「新式婚姻」；而且即使寶玉黛玉眞地團圓了，也不見得就可以代表一光明美滿的結合」。全片劇情儘量摻入熱鬧的，比較人所共知的情節，這是第二個取巧。可是編導底技巧委實捕劣得可憐，各節願的接凑是顯得這樣生硬不自然。鏡頭底突兀，人物出塲手法底勉强，在在使觀衆與起非奢過「紅樓多」說部不能暸解之感！對自多數是根據原著而略加「現代化」的，當原著里沒有可供參考時，却又露出了窮迫底馬脚。人物性格都走了樣，情緒更談不上。</p>
<p>…其實，用這樣一部小說作品攝為電影，就是多下一點功夫，使成為略具藝術價値的作品，也决不會因而少掉幾個歡衆。</p>

<h3>體育　籃球義賽最後一仗　中西靑今晚決戰　並有全滬健美標準男子表演　節目八時開始賽畢行給獎禮</h3>
<p>本報助學金足監球義賽，即將於今晚八時開始畫畢後，功德圓滿。此次承籃球會靑年會與各球隊之玉成，華聯藥廠總經理張溎祥君之担任招待中西靑兩隊費用，及社會各界人士踴躍參加，乃得順利進行。本報助學金方面護益不淺，後日加惠學子，亦各界人士之造福無嚴。今夜之籃以為決賽，並有美男子表演，行給獎典禮，勢不加倍熱鬧也。</p>
<p>中西各勝一塲今晚最後决戰</p>
<p>按此次籃球義賽，邀請中靑西靑兩隊，作三賽二勝制。中胥集華聯藥仁餘汕隊及華南何金貴等將士。西靑為巨人蒙諾克之混合旅，雙方各有强師。第一塲（十二日）中靑由華聯藥單獨應戰，賴將士努力，戰略得當，取得騰利。（二十三－十八）第二塲（十四日）中靑以仁餘為主，輔以張錦璇何金貴。不幸旣以球運惡劣，林維聽且以脚踝抽筋離塲。最後更以卓國榮四次規罰出，終致一蹶不振，痛遭慘敗。（二十九－十一）目下旣已各勝一次，今晚之戰，當屬生死關頭，雙方必各出力，聞中靑方面由張　祥余　子兩君，從事研究陣容之支配及作戰之方法，藉以收克敵至果之效，筆者不才，略獻　　之見。</p>
<p>觀察番將情形陣容支配我見</p>
<p>觀乎西靑之作戰，其進攻方式，採用V字形。即一人得球後，其前距離五步左右，即有二人阻擋對方之人，此二人亦為對方所必然注意者。得球者乃乘此機會而遠射不中之球，利用長人浮尼克及耶龍作跟進。其守衛方法，採取嚴寗人釘人制。賴氣力之够與夫幾年之經騐，極見利害。明乎此則我人當能知以己之長，攻人之短。唯此次中靑旣有各隊健將，支配陣容殊難。况目下監球作戰，已趨絕對注重於隊的合作，決不憑個人技術而稱雄也。筆者現以為用華聯四將及輔以仁餘之馬　希或余郇子。如用馬燦希者，則為馬及錫麟仟衛，而以吳成章張顯侖孔廣益為鋒。其理由五人中僅一將為他隊隊員，當不知影饗聯絡。但有謂阿孔之前鋒，未必能盡如人意，張　祥君亦有此見，此說當屬有理。阿孔久鎭後方，必欲其出任前鋒者，地位自必生疏。然我以為阿孔能射，且極穩健，更以燦希頗能利用機會　進，則斯時阿孔可隨機退後，不致有漏洞·萬一阿孔真不慣於前綫者，當可以余郇子任鋒，老為之衛，應由阿孔與錫麟搭檔。余　子能在前鋒供球，用其機警，予吳成章張顯　或錫麟　進之成就，出。未識張余二人，亦以我言為然耶？故中靑守衛之道，當有人以為應亦用人釘人，至少為提高水準之戰術。唯觀察各個之長力及練習時問之甚短，我以為今戰中祇能仍製用較為純熱之（Zone）如能地位站準及注意其V字進攻術，阻擋其長人跟進。我可保險番將缺少發展，無計可施。</p>
<p>健美男子表演値得我人參觀</p>
<p>今晚籃球賽，定下午八時起仍在八仙橋靑年會健身房舉行，中間並將有靑年會舉辦健美男子之優勝者，第一名柳顆　，第二名黃輝，第三名茅冠卿三君作人體表演。溯過去海上從無此項比賽，有之　花國總統皇后以及各學枝之校花等而已。趨重於色情性質，未足為法。此次靑年會所舉辦者，綜合醫學家之評判，美術家之觀察，及體育家之論斷，合乎科學。據該會梁兆安君云：在海外此項表演，視為平常，亦極受人注目，當局獎液。且實際上確為引起民衆興趣，增强國民體格，與民族大有裨益。在上海此為第一次嘗試，成績頗佳。所選出之優勝員，確具健康美及當有內心美的道德思想。使我人知健美之標準，女子亦可藉此明瞭男子如何可稱健美。故前次比賽時如未去參觀者，今夜宜往參觀，一行而得兩種藝術欣賞，誠不可多得之機會。預料今晚之盛况，超乎以前二役毫無疑問，盼各界人士捷足早去，俾免向隅！</p>
<h3>助學金足球義賽　評東僑球藝</h3>
<p>本報助學金足球義賽，由東華出戰僑聯，在上週五（九日）假跑馬廳足球塲比賽，觀衆因愛慕東華球藝，而僑聯得天津隊四義將助陣，以故爭先恐後，萬人空巷。看台人頭擠動，本報助學金之幸。此賽汝林康侯氏行開球禮，李香關李　華兩小姐給獎。譚敬·潘三省·沈嗣良·周文瑞·周家騏·沈冋春·諸公及體育會足球會警察局及其他有關係人士之熱心囊助，表示無限感謝焉。</p>
<p>略敘戰情</p>
<p>開賽後，僑聯賴軍心之壯，攻勢　　，環攻柬華不休。幸莊·李·後防森嚴，得免於難。僑聯僅有攻勢，不得其門而入，徒呼負負。東華將士，胸有成竹，久靜乃動。韓寵海深人腹地，對方羅旭萊絆人犯規，判罰十二碼球，由孫錦順踢進。未二分鐘東華藉士氣狂盛，幼良開角球，經張林根頭傳，李奎再頂，打破敵門。一罰一頂，雙喜臨門。僑聯在上半時將臨終前，因張邦綸之犯規，由鮑傑罰中十二碼。上半時，東華以二對一勝。下生時僑聯孤注一擲，全軍反攻。卒以射門乏將，越野之球，不計其數。反為東華孫錦順打進空門。以三對一壓倒邀將之僑聯隊，保持本屆常務榮譽，誠傑作也。</p>
<p>評論球藝</p>
<p>東華是戰大部份時間處于守。故守的方面，表演有節有拍。其迂迥戰術，應用得體，亳無空隙。罈福積莊友仁，尤見頭頭是道。唯張林根稱覺失常耳。邦綸之守門漸趨神化，胆大細膩，兼而有之。小張能虛心上進，異日必有造就。有云，照其近况，可超乎劉顯决之上，不為過也。是日東華之攻，未見如何精湛。蓋龍海奔跑過多，反之老孫則稍見懶懈，以此之故，前綫上未能有理想中之聯絡。然其能鑒于對方守門之矯健，絕不輕事攻門。利用最佳機會，輕破敵門。使彼門得英雄無用武之地，飲恨無窮。是智與經騐之成功。</p>
<p>再論僑聯進攻之策，袛用中央突進一法，不知更變，尤以射門無將。其所以不能得球者，即此理也。如能多利用兩翼，拉長鋒綫，則東華之守衛，未必能盡力到底，早露倦態。其守術之肯奔，與夫脚頭之清爽，衆皆折服。唯其地位呆板，僅作（Positional　Play）區域守衛，乃有吃力不討好之苦。東華知其弱點，利角兩翼引誘，故終有顯此失彼之處，中衛綫上更不能多作後顧。誠為不足取。</p>
<h3>體壇什錦</h3>
<p>新大沽路四五一號上海女中所主辦之第二届上女盃排球聯賽，自開幕以來，華達與華嚴，均保不敗戰績，於明日下午五時起，在該校舉行決賽，解決冠軍誰屬。並排有二場表演賽。五時起，為女子上女對錄隊。五時三刻為男子華影戰白隊。賽畢，請校董林康侯致閉幕，影星周璇·王丹鳳二小姐給獎。不售門票，憑贈券入塲。</p>
<p>中北籃球隊健將李賽中君，近暦華影公司招考小生，實中初試竟獲第一。他日複賽決賽，常能一如風願。以喪中之多才多藝，更以目下影界鬧小生荒中，前途當極燦爛。預祝此驗壇名將，一躍而為影壇紅星。</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Control Organization</h3>
<p>The issue of adjusting the control organization has been widely publicized. Recently, it has been decided to: Revise the list of controlled commodities, limiting it to daily necessities for people's livelihood. Separately establish various control committees as implementing agencies. Use the National Commercial Control Association as a comprehensive supervisory, review, and liaison agency, no longer directly handling control work. On the 14th of this month, the government announced the reassignment of Mr. Wen Lanting as Chairman of the Commercial Control Association, and the transformation of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee into the Flour and Wheat Control Committee, marking the first step in implementing the adjustment. After this adjustment, the control organization will become more sound and comprehensive. We are truly happy for the future of control!</p>
<p>Control work is an innovation in our country. There are no established rules to follow, and it is not customary for the people. In the past year or so, the hardships and difficulties faced by the Commercial Control Association have been understood and sympathized with by those who are familiar with the Association's situation. Mr. Tang Shoumin shouldered heavy responsibilities for more than a year, strictly disciplined himself, and was courageous in taking responsibility, enabling the control work to take shape. His contribution is undeniable. What is regrettable is that the work of purchasing cotton cloth has not yet been completed, and the disposal methods for new products have not yet been stipulated, so that those who rely on allocation are eagerly waiting, and factory owners are idle, affecting economic circulation and reducing material production. This is one aspect. How to stipulate the reserved quantity has not been announced; the amount of the approved quantity also lacks an absolute standard. Even if there is no ulterior motive, the reason exists, and the unevenness inevitably leads to speculation. Regarding the employment of personnel, there may have been a failure to select the right people, and some may not have deeply understood the Association's service creed of "impartiality and integrity," thus inevitably giving society cause for criticism. This is the third aspect. What is most regrettable is that after the Association was established, due to the divergence of government orders and the lack of uniformity in affairs, most of the time had to be spent on political coordination work. Therefore, the failure of the control efficiency to fully achieve the expected goal was also half caused by the environment. Although the control organization will be adjusted in the future, if the government does not find ways to solve the actual difficulties, then how can the adjustment of the control organization alone be effective? Therefore, whether or not there are measures for future control still depends on whether the government's orders can be unified and whether the Allied authorities can provide further assistance. In addition, we have four hopes for the control authorities themselves:</p>
<p>The most serious problems at present are food panic in Shanghai and the panic over daily industrial goods in the interior, both of which are in imminent danger. Circulation adjustment can not only solve the suffering of people's livelihood but also promote financial circulation.</p>
<p>Purchasing and allocation ultimately rely on production. Without production, purchasing and allocation are empty words. Therefore, the most important task of the control agency is to cooperate closely with the economic and administrative agencies to solve the suffering of the industrial sector as much as possible in order to promote the increase of materials.</p>
<p>Personnel issues are the most important issues for any organization. The reason why various control agencies in the past could not avoid social criticism is that personnel issues accounted for the largest component. Therefore, various control agencies, in the future, regarding the employment of personnel, in addition to talent, should especially pay attention to integrity.</p>
<p>This adjustment further demonstrates that the government fully trusts the leaders of the Shanghai industrial and commercial circles and gives them autonomy. It is hoped that the industrial and commercial circles will recognize that the current situation is wartime and that we are facing a decisive stage, which is by no means comparable to peacetime. Those who have prioritized personal interests in the past should give them up immediately, and "selflessness and dedication to public service" should be the spirit jointly adopted by the authorities and various industries in the future.</p>
<p>The new Chairman, Mr. Wen Lanting, is a respected elder. Following Mr. Tang Shoumin, he has taken on heavy responsibilities. His spirit of being courageous in his duties is truly admirable. It is hoped that after taking office, he will adjust the internal structure, closely supervise his subordinates, so that the control work will become more perfect day by day, and the social and people's livelihood will become more stable day by day. This will not only make the control methods gradually gain the trust of society but also be a great blessing for people's livelihood!</p>

<h3>The Path Forward for Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>— Yu Song Yuanti</p>
<p>Lecture given at National Shanghai University on the 6th of this month</p>
<p>In the next ten years, Japan will likely control England and America and secure resources in the South. For those ten years and the fifty years thereafter, Japan will continue its economic war against England and America with its friendly nation, China. China will become a producer for its own needs and for the market of 500 million people in Asia. The gold of England and America must be completely extracted from "Greater East Asia." Therefore, Japan and China must cooperate in production. In terms of food, China and Manchuria, in particular, must drastically increase their efficiency. Processing industries and heavy industries must also be developed. Therefore, Chinese youth should learn science and technology from Japan in the future. I hope that you will work hard in physics, science, mathematics, and other natural sciences. Shanghai has a Japanese national natural science research institute, which you should utilize.</p>
<p>I have a friend who is related to the Shanghai Municipal Government who once told me this: "I used to collect butterflies, but because my Chinese friends kept sending them, I and the English collectors became like brothers." This saying applies to all academic research. There are no national borders or ethnicities in natural science. Two plus two equals four in any country. The chemical equation for the composition of water does not change in Japan or China. Chinese university students often experience unfortunate events because they are young and energetic and engage in political movements. Being incited by the verbal propaganda of a few politicians does not make one a university student. This is because of insufficient self-awareness and a lack of academic research. If Chinese and Japanese university students can cooperate in natural sciences and spiritual sciences, which have the most in common, it will surely improve the culture of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself, my area of specialization is Buddhist studies. In particular, I study the history of Buddhism, and I also research Buddhist economic thought. There are many temples near Shanghai, and the organization, economic system, and thought of those temples are very interesting. This is the same in China, Japan, and even its homeland, India. Therefore, I can have pleasant conversations with these Buddhist scholars and lay practitioners, and the conversations are very harmonious. As a result, in less than a week, we have become as close as brothers of ten years. Because Sun Yat-sen and the early Chinese politicians were all well-educated, they were able to promote cooperation between China and Japan even in politics. Why is it that Sun Yat-sen was able to achieve cooperation between China and Japan, but some of his disciples cannot? Who knows the reason? On this point, I think everyone should consider it carefully. I especially hope that Chinese youth will consider it deeply.</p>
<p>After enduring for ten years, Japan finally declared war on its old enemies, England and America, so the relationship between China and Japan has become even clearer. Originally, these two countries shared the same written language and the same racial destiny and should have been cooperating peacefully in all aspects long ago, but they were constantly provoked and alienated by England and America. However, because of this "Greater East Asia War Declaration," the common enemies of Greater East Asia are now clear, so the future of China and Japan is tied to this "Greater East Asia." Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the idea of ​​worshipping England and America, which is hidden in the heart of obstruction, can be eliminated. Naturally, among the youth in China, there are still those who are good at English, or like to eat Western food, or like to watch Western movies. They have not yet been able to get rid of their dependence on England and America. Such young people should be said to be going against the times.</p>
<p>Cooperate to Expel England and America</p>
<p>Among them, there may be more sophisticated and realistic young people who will say, "England and America are powerful countries, and they may come back to be the kings of Shanghai again, so we must not do anything rash." I want to say that such thinking is not unreasonable. But if we do not expel the powerful England and America this time, they will never be driven out. Therefore, if China and Japan miss this good opportunity to drive England and America out of Asia, I am afraid that there will never be another opportunity. In this great war, Chinese youth are also participating. But what form should they take to participate in the war? I think it is good to go to Japanese military factories to learn to work, or to engage in food production in Central China, or even to assist in the rural clearing work.</p>
<p>Today, Japan is fighting England and America for China's autonomy, and I hope that everyone can endure for ten years. I dare to assert that the spiritual strength of the British and American people cannot sustain a ten-year war.</p>
<p>Perhaps my statement gives an arbitrary impression because I am enthusiastic about the relationship between China and Japan. But I definitely do not want to express casual opinions based on a good relationship with Japan. I hope everyone will consider it carefully. Among the youth, there may be those who admire foreign countries and rely on England and America. Perhaps they overvalue Western thought because of the educational undertakings run by Christian churches in China. But being blinded by Western thought is China's misfortune and a cause of discord between China and Japan. You all know the name of Confucius, but you do not seem to cherish the "Analects" very much. But no matter what, you are Chinese, and no matter what, Chinese people cannot become Westerners. In the end, they are still the people of the "Analects." Now is the era of displaying this Eastern spirit. In the future, you must delve into scientific techniques, and at the same time, you must have a sense of self-respect for Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism—these Chinese cultures.</p>
<p>Today, I was at the cafeteria and shared a table with a young Chinese man, and I asked him: Suppose there are three kinds of people: "First, those with power; second, those with property; and third, those with high virtue." Which of these three do you think is great? What do you think he answered? If he said that one of the first two was great, then I would want to remain silent; but he pointed to the third. I was very happy and shouted, "The spirit of China has not perished!"</p>
<p>Although some people criticize Chinese youth for engaging in political movements and utilitarianism, that is only a part of the youth. The Chinese, who respect Confucius and admire the Analects, respect "virtue." This classical spirit of China is alive. Why is Sun Yat-sen respected by young people? Mr. Sun did not leave behind any property, nor did he ever become a dictator. Mr. Sun, who had none of those things, was respected by the Chinese youth because he was poor but did not lose his integrity. That is where Chinese thought lies.</p>
<p>Two or three days ago, I gave a lecture on "The Spirit of New China" at the Shanghai Radio Station. At that time, I advocated explaining the "Three Principles of the People" based on the concept of the kingly way of politics in China's five thousand years of classical spirit. Among the youth, there may be those who think that Western philosophy, politics, economics, and science are the best, and that China's past civilization has become an unusable antique today. And they regard the Three Principles of the People as economic thought. Since the Three Principles of the People are the way of the sages, there is no need to create new slogans outside of the Four Books and Five Classics. It is only if one is careless that the classics become conservative and formalized. That is just specially repainting the classical container with a new color. Only when the true spirit of China appears can the new China be born.</p>

<h3>Limiting National Banquets to be Implemented Next Month, Welfare Bureau Convenes a Discussion to Discuss Methods</h3>
<p>In order to meet the wartime system, encourage thrift, reserve materials, and enhance national power, the Ministry of Social Welfare specially formulated the Outline for Limiting Wartime National Banquets, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Supreme National Defense Conference for approval, and was promulgated and implemented by the National Government. Now, in Shanghai, national banquets are the most extravagant. The materials consumed and wasted by banquets every day are truly alarming. Therefore, it is particularly urgent to implement restrictions on national banquets in Shanghai. Yesterday (the 15th), the Shanghai Special Municipal Social Welfare Bureau specially invited representatives from relevant agencies, social organizations, newspapers, and restaurants in the city to hold a discussion in the conference room of the bureau at 3 pm to discuss implementation methods. Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun was also invited to participate in the training because of official business in Shanghai. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Discussion Meeting</p>
<p>In addition to Minister Ding Mocun and Director Chen Dongbai, the participants included Municipal Government representative Ku Jingzi, Director of the Social Welfare Bureau Sun Yishe, Chief Secretary Hu Shouqi, and the heads of various departments, representatives from the First District Office Wang Yiyi, representative from the Economic Bureau Wan Shuhuang, representative from the First Police Bureau Zou Qinming, representative from the Second Police Bureau Qian Xuan, and representatives from various social organizations, including Wu Jieyu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Ren Yunpeng from the Thrift Association, Liu Songtao and Zou Huaqing from the Restaurant Industry Association, and Yang Rongwu from the Western Restaurant Industry Association. First, Director Sun chaired the meeting, reported the significance of the convocation, and expressed his hope that everyone would express their opinions and earnestly promote it. Then, Minister Ding Mocun delivered a speech, followed by Ren Yunpeng, the representative of the Thrift Association, who expressed his opinion that the government's promotion of restrictions on wartime national banquets should be strictly followed from the perspective of the people. He hoped that the bureau would strictly enforce it in the future to rectify the extravagant atmosphere in Shanghai. Then, Liu Songtao, the representative of the Restaurant Industry Association, said that he was deeply moved by the government's hard work and would follow the order in the future. Later, it was decided that the restriction on national banquets would be implemented starting from July 1. Next, the price limit for frugal dishes will be reviewed and approved by the Social Welfare Bureau and the Economic Bureau in the future before being submitted to the Municipal Government for implementation.</p>
<p>Minister Ding's Speech</p>
<p>Main points of Minister Ding's speech: Thrift is to promote frugality and simplicity. Frugality is a virtue for individuals, the so-called "frugality to cultivate integrity." For a country, it can enrich national power. It is necessary in peacetime, and it is even more urgent in wartime to reserve materials and cultivate combat power. The opposite of thrift is extravagance and waste. There are many things that are extravagant and wasteful in society. The most obvious is banquets, the so-called "vermilion doors smell of wine and meat, and the road has frozen bones," "a rich family's banquet is half a year's food for the poor." The extravagance and waste of banquets has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more fierce today. Therefore, the Ministry of Social Welfare started from the most common and wasteful banquets in society to implement thrift, and formulated and promulgated the Outline for Limiting National Banquets. Because Shanghai has the most unnecessary banquets of this kind, it attaches great importance to the implementation of banquet restrictions in Shanghai. Seeing grand banquets, one table costs ten thousand gold, has become a common phenomenon in Shanghai. It is not only a waste of materials and a waste of natural resources, but it is also not necessarily beneficial to personal hygiene. Some people even think that social banquets are fearful. Then what is the meaning of banquets? The reason is actually a reflection of the hypocritical psychology of the host, thinking that insufficient delicacies cannot show respect, and insufficient grand banquets cannot be called extravagance. The so-called show is very big, and they imitate each other, competing for luxury, and becoming a custom. Therefore, to implement frugal banquets, we must first break this psychology, and regard abundant delicacies and grand banquets as shameful and despicable. Everyone should abide by it, and slowly it can be changed. In this wartime, all countries attach importance to thrift. In particular, the Japanese people, their serious life and spirit of self-discipline, are admirable. Compared with our country's people's frivolity and extravagance, it is truly shameful. Therefore, the National Government lists the implementation of thrift as one of the important wartime social policies. It is hoped that the whole country will cooperate and implement it, starting from limiting banquets, in order to achieve universal realization. It is fortunate.</p>
<p>Limitation Outline</p>
<p>The Outline for Limiting Wartime National Banquets, which was approved by the Supreme National Defense Conference and the Executive Yuan, now lists its main points: Banquets are not allowed for birthdays, moving, engagements, funerals, and birthdays under the age of sixty. Wartime national banquet dishes should be as simple as possible, and luxury and noble items such as shark fins, bird's nests, bear paws, and abalone should not be used. In wartime banquets, each table should have 10 people as a principle. Each table of dishes, including large and small cold and hot soups, sweet and salty flavors, should not exceed eight dishes. However, if there are more than 10 people, one dish can be added for each additional person. If there are not enough eight people, the entire table of dishes cannot be used. In addition to the prescribed dishes, one snack can be added if no rice is provided, and no snacks can be provided if rice is provided. If it is Western food, each person should not exceed four colors except for coffee and fruit. The price of each table for Chinese food and each person for Western food shall be decided by the local Restaurant Industry Association and submitted to the Economic Bureau and the Social Welfare Bureau in special cities, and submitted to the county and municipal governments for approval and publication in counties and cities. It is absolutely forbidden to prepare foreign wine for guests to drink. If it is a lunch, tea should be used instead of wine, and any wine vessels are prohibited from being used. If any restaurants in various places violate the provisions of this outline, they will be punished according to the following items: (First time) Warning, (Second time) A fine of 500 to 5,000 yuan, (Third time) Suspension of business for three to seven days. Those who violate more than three times will have their business license revoked.</p>
<h3>Applying for Rice Transportation Permits Exceeds Hundreds of Thousands of Stones, Shanghai's Future Food Supply is Gradually Booming</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of this city approved the free transportation of food rice from five dou to ten shi, rice merchants have been enthusiastically requesting the Rice and Grain Control Committee to issue temporary permits, as well as rice merchants applying for permits to purchase food rice from various places. The quantity has exceeded hundreds of thousands of shi. The various parties involved in vegetable transportation and purchasing have been given extremely convenient conditions, and the food rice has already been shipped and will arrive in Shanghai soon. In addition, in order to accurately calculate the quantity of food rice transported into Shanghai, in order to provide a basis for studying future countermeasures, the association sends staff to various import ports every day to conduct on-site surveys and statistics. The daily quantity is about ten thousand shi, so the source is still considered to be booming.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Professional Committee is Currently Being Closed</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan specially ordered Sun Zhongli to be the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Association, and Jing Shang Tai Zhong to be the deputy chairman. It is reported that the association is actively handling the closing of the previous affairs. The internal organization of the reorganized organization has been discussed and decided by the association, and it has also drafted a specific plan for the unified collection and distribution of flour and wheat this year, which is being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is heard that in order to continue to promote the collection and distribution of flour and wheat, the association is proceeding with the purchase work as usual during this reorganization. In addition to sending staff to various regions to urge wheat firms and entrusted merchants to purchase barley and yuan wheat, as for the upcoming new wheat purchase business, as soon as the implementation plan for unified collection and distribution is submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it will be implemented for purchase.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Vagrant Labor Camp</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government of the Ministry of Social Welfare, in view of the fact that there are vagrants and hooligans everywhere in the city, which seriously damage the city's appearance and disrupt public order, has specially organized the Shanghai Vagrant Labor Camp to accommodate vagrants, educate and reform them, and force them to work, so as to engage in production. Now that the funding for the organization is huge, the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce has been asked to write to the industry associations, banks, money houses, factories, companies, and firms to donate generously. The fundraising methods are recorded below: All industry associations, banks, money houses, factories, companies, and firms in the city that donate 2,000 yuan at a time are Grade A, 1,000 yuan are Grade B, 500 yuan are Grade C, and those with capital of more than 10 million yuan donate 10,000 yuan to more than 100,000 yuan at a time. The donated funds are collected by the industry associations, and the receipts are distributed by the preparatory office. After receiving the funds, they are transferred to the designated bank every two days, and the deposit slip is sent to the office and forwarded to various newspapers for disclosure. All donations must be paid in full by the end of June.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Reconnoiters Shanghai, Citizens Should Step Up Air Defense</h3>
<p>On the mornings of the 12th and 13th, enemy aircraft flew to the Nanjing and Shanghai areas for reconnaissance. However, the Japanese army was on strict alert, and the enemy aircraft did not move and fled. The Japanese defense authorities pointed out the following points yesterday in connection with this matter and urged the citizens to pay close attention.</p>
<p>The US Air Force in China has recently suffered a great blow from the Japanese Air Force, so it is currently trying its best to avoid a direct conflict with the Japanese army and is dedicated to conducting air guerrilla warfare behind the enemy. On the 12th and 13th, enemy aircraft sneaked into the surrounding areas of Shanghai, so an alarm was issued. At that time, the Shanghai citizens' air defense attitude was extremely calm and composed due to continuous training. This made the Chang Bureau feel at ease. At present, the enemy aircraft's activities are only reconnaissance flights, but in order to exert the effect of psychological warfare, the enemy aircraft may launch air guerrilla warfare in the future. Citizens must work harder on air defense, and should especially avoid being influenced by rumors and falling into the trap of enemy spies. Also, do not abandon the control of lights.</p>
<p>Short Commentary</p>
<h3>Coping with the Wartime Environment</h3>
<p>Today there are two pieces of news that should be paid attention to: Enemy aircraft are coming to Shanghai for reconnaissance, and citizens should pay more attention to air defense. It is strictly forbidden for hotels to play mahjong late at night.</p>
<p>Although these two pieces of news are two different things, we believe that they have a related meaning.</p>
<p>First, enemy aircraft are coming to Shanghai for reconnaissance, and the authorities have pointed out the points that citizens should pay attention to. In this decisive battle stage, enemy aircraft activity is originally an expected thing and there is nothing to be surprised about. Special attention should be paid to the control of lights. Citizens must understand that the purpose of light control is to maintain their own safety. Since it is for their own safety, they should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that it should have been thoroughly prohibited long ago to prohibit hotels from playing mahjong late at night. And its scope is not limited to hotels, it should also be extended to clubs and homes, etc. Mahjong is gambling, which wastes time and energy, wastes money and consumes electricity. From any point of view, whether it is light control, saving electricity, or practicing wartime life, it must be strictly prohibited. It is truly shameful to speak of wartime life if even this small matter cannot be thoroughly prohibited.</p>
<p>Shanghai is a wartime city and is currently facing a decisive battle stage. The Shanghai Municipal authorities and citizens should jointly cope with the wartime environment, pay attention to air defense, pay attention to light control, and the authorities should ban one by one all so-called "night entertainment" that violates the wartime environment and hinders air defense, and citizens should jointly restrain themselves.</p>
<h3>Lao Zha Sub-bureau Cracks Down on Small Gambling Den, All Offenders are Handed Over to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation</h3>
<p>In order to refresh the appearance of the Great Shanghai, the Municipal Bureau has the greatest determination to close the gambling dens in the South City on March 29. However, the general gamblers dared to sneak into the first district to secretly gamble and set up mobile gambling dens. The First Police Bureau had already paid attention and ordered the sub-bureaus to investigate. The Lao Zha sub-bureau received a report on the previous day (the 12th) that Zhang Weinan had set up a small gambling den in Lane 207 of Yunnan Road to gather people for gambling and draw profits. The sub-bureau chief He Dehui ordered Liu Junqing, the director of the judicial section, to send detectives to arrest them. The suspects were in the midst of calling out numbers, and the boss Zhang Weinan and gamblers Jia Fugen, Chen Xirong, Guo Guanliu, Zhong Qiurong, Su Fang, Lu Jueying, Liu Wenqing, Tan Xiao, Ju Deshou, Luo Lifen, Xu Jia, Luo Hua, Zhou Daqi, and Li Guohua and other fifteen people were arrested on the spot. After being brought to the bureau for interrogation, they all confessed to gathering for gambling. They were handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation and then transferred to the court for investigation in accordance with the law.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Hotels from Playing Mahjong Late at Night</p>
<p>In addition, in order to earnestly maintain public order, the sub-bureau strictly prohibits hotels and inns from playing mahjong and singing loudly late at night in order to maintain peace. It has formally notified all hotels that during this long period of light control, passengers are restricted from engaging in any behavior that disturbs the peace after midnight (such as playing bamboo mahjong and other gatherings that cause noise, loud singing that is sufficient to disturb the peace of others, etc.). If passengers refuse to listen, the person in charge of each hotel shall report to the bureau and be punished with five days of detention in accordance with Article 35 of the Distant Police Penalty Law as a warning. If the person in charge of the hotel does not report it and is found out, the person in charge of each hotel will also be severely responsible and punished according to the law.</p>
<h3>Unlawful Merchants Detained are Temporarily Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Economic Security Office of the First Police Bureau of this city, it has actively promoted economic security matters and has conducted strict investigations into the unlawful acts of merchants in various industries, such as hoarding and speculation, manipulating prices, and the unauthorized price increases and illegal profiteering of various stores. In recent days, it has detained more than 250 unlawful merchants of oil, fodder, rice, southern goods, northern goods, and various essential daily necessities. After investigation, it was found that some of the relationships were minor, and they were temporarily released on bail after finding a guarantor and issuing a guarantee. However, the office is still investigating the business behavior of each person. In addition, the office is continuing to conduct close investigations into whether there are any villains in various industries, and those who have them will be arrested and investigated in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Health Movement Conference Ends Successfully Yesterday, Director Yuan Expresses Thoughts</h3>
<p>The Health Movement Conference in this city was planned by the health authorities and started activities on the first day of this month. The various tasks have been promoted by the guidance of the service personnel and the citizens on schedule, and the results are very good. In terms of the exhibition, the experience meeting, the election race, the horse race, and the ball game have failed to allow the citizens to visit extensively. The bureau has approved the extension of the exhibition until the 15th of this month. The exhibition has been held for half a month, and it is estimated that more than 300,000 citizens have visited it, which has achieved great results. Director Yuan of the Health Bureau expressed his thoughts on this Health Movement Conference as follows:</p>
<p>The purpose of the Health Movement Conference is to arouse the general citizens' concept of cleanliness and attach importance to public health, which is a concrete manifestation of health education. The Health Movement Conference held in this city was originally scheduled to be held on May 15. Later, the bureau believed that the Health Movement Conference held in this city in the past was limited to the old urban area. Now that the concession has been recovered and the municipal administration has been unified, it should be unified. It was decided to hold it jointly with the first district. The Health Movement Conference had to be postponed, and the various activities of the Health Movement in this city were promoted simultaneously in the first district, which is an unprecedented initiative in history. Although the various activities are related to the weather, they are still satisfactory. In terms of the exhibition, during this extraordinary period, financial resources and materials are insufficient, and there are still models and specimens of various public health matters, some of which have been lost due to the war and have not been made in time, so it is inevitable that they are incomplete. As for the health facilities in each district of this area, they are only introduced to the citizens for understanding by taking this opportunity, and it is hoped that the citizens will cooperate. In the future, no matter what is related to epidemic prevention measures and item inspection, they can be handled according to the law without hesitation, in order to protect the health of the citizens. However, the health movement in this city has been held more than ten times, and the citizens' actions that hinder health are still common, which shows that the purpose of health education has not been achieved. Therefore, the director of this bureau will supervise the responsible departments to actively promote health education in the future. As for the Winter Health Movement Conference, it will be held on December 15 in accordance with the regulations of the Military Central Government. The exhibition and various activities will be prepared regularly in the future, so the next conference will be more substantial. This Health Movement Conference has been assisted by the heads of various agencies and all walks of life. The association expresses its deep gratitude, and hopes that all walks of life will cooperate at any time in the future to make the health of this city even better and the health of the citizens can be protected. This is what I sincerely hope for.</p>

<h3>Welfare Football Game - Account Statement Published</h3>
<p>The Social Welfare Department sponsors various welfare initiatives, which are subsidized by the department to maintain operations. Recently, due to rising prices, expenditures have increased sharply, making it more difficult to sustain these initiatives. Various welfare organizations have requested increased funding from the department. Therefore, Minister Ding of the department requested Shen Siliang, chairman of the Shanghai Football Association, and Pan Sanxing, vice-chairman, to take advantage of the Jin-Lian football team's visit to Shanghai to hold a welfare football game to raise funds for welfare. On June 3rd, the Football Association invited the Jin Lian team and the Donghua team to play at the racetrack. People from all walks of life in Shanghai enthusiastically supported the event. The number of spectators on that day was unprecedented. It was generally estimated that the number of 200-yuan seat ticket holders would be over 20,000, but the actual number of 200-yuan seat tickets sold was only 9,318, which was far from the actual number of people present. The reason for this was that the audience was overly enthusiastic that day, and there were too many people. Although the police cooperated, maintaining order was still difficult. Some people wanted to buy tickets but couldn't, and others seized the opportunity to enter without tickets, resulting in more than half of the audience being without tickets. The summary of income and expenditure for this welfare game is eight sheets, totaling 1,863,600 yuan. 203 1,000-yuan tickets were sold, totaling 203,000 yuan. 40 20,000-yuan honorary tickets were sold, totaling 800,000 yuan. In addition, 30,000 yuan was donated voluntarily, for a total of 2,896,600 yuan in ticket revenue and voluntary donations. However, 260,000 yuan of the honorary tickets have not yet been collected and are being urged. The names of those who donated voluntarily and purchased 20,000-yuan tickets will be disclosed in various newspapers in the coming days to express our gratitude. The allocation of funds will also be announced in the coming days after it has been decided. According to the person in charge of the Social Welfare Department, although the income of this welfare football game was greatly affected by the fact that more than half of the audience did not have tickets, the enthusiasm of the audience and the importance attached to sports, as well as the utmost efforts of the police to maintain order, and the wonderful skills of the Donghua team and the Jin Lian team, and the assistance of all the staff of the racetrack and the Football Association, are all deeply appreciated.</p>

<h3>Characteristics of the Air War in India and Burma</h3>
<p>One of the characteristics of the recent air war in India and Burma is that the enemy uses fighter planes as the main force of combat. The reason for the change in the elements of naval warfare can be considered that after entering today's era of aerial fortresses, although the enemy used the so-called most excellent bombers, unified Type B24 and Boeing 17B class, to carry out air raids, the bombing effect and the expected damage were minimal due to the strong Japanese air defense. If this is the case, then today's phenomenon can be regarded as a temporary phenomenon before their bombers have further progress than today.</p>
<p>Fear of Japanese Aircraft Power</p>
<p>Although it is not known what kind of attacks the enemy will try to make in the coming rainy season, their fighter era itself has important operational significance and value for them. This can be seen in their current and future aerial tactical thinking and operational. The B24, the main force of the air raids, with the air raid on Yangon on December 1 of last year as the last, had already completely withdrawn from the stage of daytime air raids, except for using night or cloudy days to attack. As for the reasons, they are as follows:</p>
<p>If the bombers currently used by the enemy have a cruising speed of less than 500 kilometers and a practical altitude limit of less than 12,000 meters, then no matter how thick their armor or how strong their armament, they are definitely not the match for Japanese fighter planes. This is the limit of their performance.</p>
<p>Even with fighter escorts, the power of the Japanese interceptor fighters is much greater, which will hinder the movement of the escort fighters and make them fear that they will all perish together.</p>
<p>Even at the cost of sacrifice, not much effect can be expected on heavily defended targets.</p>
<p>Due to the advent of radio wave detectors, surprise attacks are almost impossible. The above is the tactical limit. In short, even if P31 and P38 are used to cover B24, it is difficult to break through the dense air defense line of Yangon and other places.</p>
<p>Performance of American and British Fighters</p>
<p>In this way, the so-called fighter era has appeared. Especially since the beginning of March this year, it has been nothing short of an era of fighter supremacy. From the ideal of carrying a large number of bombs to attack distant places and destroy key locations in one fell swoop, fighters are inferior to bombers, but in today's world, where interceptor fighters are the main force and various air defense weapons are mobilized, if you want to break into the aerial fortress circle, you cannot expect too much from existing models other than fighters. Because fighters have relatively superior speed and maneuverability, it is possible to intercept or fight against enemy fighters; furthermore, they can split up and find scattered individual targets and break them one by one. Looking at the actual situation of recent enemy aircraft attacks, the total number of enemy aircraft attacking the entire combat zone of the Fogon area and the Arakan area is about one hundred and several dozens per day, of which 90% are fighter planes. These fighters, which replace bombers and become the main force of long-range hammer attacks, are mostly American Lockheed P38 and North American P51, followed by British Spitfires and Buffaloes.</p>
<p>These are all enemy fighters that are said to be excellent. The P38 has a total load of more than one ton, a maximum speed of five hundred kilometers per hour, a practical rate of climb of more than nine kilometers, and is equipped with four 12.7mm machine guns and one 37mm cannon. It has a range of 1,400 kilometers (up to 3,500 kilometers) and is equipped with two 1,150 horsepower engines. It is a twin-engine aircraft. The P51 has a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a practical rate of climb of 11,400 meters, a range of 1,400 kilometers, and is equipped with six 12.7mm machine guns and one Allison liquid-cooled 1,160 horsepower engine. The Spitfire IX fighter has a maximum speed of 600 kilometers per hour, a climbing altitude of 12,000 meters, a range of 800 kilometers, and weapons include four 7.7mm machine guns and two 20mm cannons. The engine is a Rolls-Royce liquid-cooled engine. It is a high-altitude fighter with 10,000 meters. (The performance of the above aircraft is based on enemy announcements.)</p>
<p>Change in Formation</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the speed and firepower of these fighters have increased, and their climbing and high-altitude performance are also excellent, but their range is extremely short, so they must use the front-line bases where bombers are not easy to stay. Chittagong, Sylhet, Imphal, and Tinsukia seem to be their most powerful bases for invading operations, and their targets are mainly Japanese air bases. Until around March and April, they usually attacked in batches with formations of about ten P38s or P51s. The P51 intruded in ultra-low altitude flight, spraying the ground with machine guns, like a sprinkler. The attack is usually once a day. However, since May, there seems to be some change in the battle clouds.</p>
<p>This is because the damage caused by Japanese interception is more than they expected, and due to the rapid strengthening of Japanese aircraft production and the smooth supply, the Japanese military strength is becoming more and more abundant, and the damage they inflict on the Japanese side is too light. When they noticed this result, they believed that if they wanted to reduce the Japanese air power, they had to make it their first priority to shoot down Japanese aircraft and launch an air battle. Therefore, in addition to the same formation of about ten fighters attacking the ground, they also adopted the tactic of forming mixed formations of several types of fighters, with the fighters in the upper layer specializing in air combat. The air raid on the Middle Burma area 00 area on May 11 was divided into three layers, consisting of dozens of P38 (low altitude), P51 (high altitude), and British Spitfire (medium altitude) fighters. And their attack must be done at once, and they often come to air raid again in a short time, using the so-called wave attack. Also, due to the popularity of radio wave weapons and the lightness of fighters, they seem to want to respond to the firepower and Japanese situation and implement ad hoc attacks. However, such attempts have become futile due to the Japanese military's ever-changing and wonderful tactics.</p>
<p>Japanese New Aircraft Active</p>
<p>The above is a summary of the enemy air force's counter-attack tactics after entering the so-called fighter era, but looking back at the operations of the Japanese air force in Burma, the bombers have not withdrawn from the attack force, and they are still fighting bravely, giving full play to the original face of the bombers. This is due to the Japanese air force's prudent and subtle operations, the Japanese aircraft's strong offensive spirit, and excellent combat skills. However, it must also be admitted that the Japanese bombers' attack is not as easy as it used to be, and it is also a fact that the tasks expected of fighter planes are greater than in the past. In the past operations in Mayu, as well as in the current Imphal operation and the operation against the airborne troops, the great activities of the Japanese new fighter squadron are something that we should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in today's world where the rear is constantly producing and replenishing, it is an absolute necessity for aerial annihilation warfare to make the aircraft and crew of the British and Americans perish together in aerial operations. In this sense, the significance of aerial annihilation warfare launched by attack and interception is obviously increasing. Recently, the war reports from various places in Burma that the air force's intercepting operations have protected and defeated many enemy aircraft are not inferior to the offensive and must be recognized.</p>
<p>Finally, in the current fierce aerial decisive battle, the importance of quantity is undoubtedly important, but what determines the final victory or defeat, no matter what, is always the quality of the crew and the performance of the aircraft. This must be kept in mind. (Tait special correspondent) Translated from the May 21st "Asahi Shimbun")</p>
<h3>Inspection Report of the English Channel</h3>
<p>The atmosphere in the English Channel has suddenly become tense due to the Anglo-American preparations for the invasion of Europe. The starting point for the Anglo-American invasion force is on the opposite shore, separated by a narrow strip of water. One type of high-speed torpedo boat plays an important role in this narrow sea area. It can be said to be a tank in the sea, fully armored and with sophisticated machinery. It has a speed of 00 knots, cuts through the waves like flying, and carries huge torpedoes on both sides. Even when approaching the enemy, it is not easy to be detected.</p>
<p>The English Channel is only 50 to 60 meters deep, and submarines cannot operate, so this type of high-speed torpedo boat has emerged. From July 1942 to the end of last year, in less than two years, 176 merchant ships (514,000 tons), 4 destroyers, 6 patrol boats, 1 floating dock, and 1 auxiliary ship have been sunk.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation of the offensive and defensive battles in the English Channel has been extremely tense amid the landing announcements of the Anglo-American forces. The most powerful enemy bases, such as Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, and London, have strictly defended coastlines. Every three days, a convoy of ships emerges from the Thames River, guarded by two to four destroyers and about ten gunboats. Five or six patrol boats and three or four minesweepers clear the way in front. Recently, in order to counter German high-speed torpedo boats, internal combustion engine gunboats and steam engine gunboats have been moored in the center of the channel to block their attack routes.</p>
<p>These internal combustion engine gunboats are 35 meters long and have a displacement of only 100 tons. They have a speed of 30 knots and are equipped with two 40mm cannons, one 20mm cannon, and two 1.5cm twin-mounted machine guns. The steam engine gunboats are about 50 meters long, have a displacement of 200 tons, and a speed of 39 knots. The main armament is two 8.8cm caliber guns. They are completely destroyer-style. These are the great enemies of the Japanese torpedo boats. Moreover, in actual warfare, their firepower and firepower are said to be superior.</p>
<p>Recently, five of these types of ships have been sunk by German torpedo boats, while German torpedo boats have only been damaged by bombing at their bases. This is enough to explain the superiority of the German navy's warriors' eyesight when attacking at night. In short, this is the result of a forward-thinking offensive spirit and a daring surprise attack.</p>
<p>The Impregnable Atlantic Fortress</p>
<p>The land-based intercepting posture that echoes the maritime offensive is now almost complete. The famous "Atlantic Wall" has countless fortresses that meander endlessly. In each fortress, the sound of intense training can be heard, and the protruding mouths of the giant cannons can be moved at any time. The machine gun positions and barracks centered on the fortress are all built underground, with green meadows and flowering gardens on top. In addition, there are layers of barbed wire and minefields, and giant cannons are installed on the rear and sides to prevent paratroopers from attacking the fortress.</p>
<p>The enemy fears this unshakable spirit and knows that the attack is ineffective, so even if enemy aircraft fly in the high sky, they will never dare to fight. Although the distance closest to the British mainland is only a dozen minutes by air, no aerial decisive battle has occurred at this protruding point of the Western European fortress. However, the enemy aircraft flying in the invisible high sky were shot down by German coastal anti-aircraft guns, and the rest were repelled.</p>
<p>The enemy saw this iron-clad German defense and felt a peaceful atmosphere that was not invaded and not threatened. The maritime warriors who stood guard judged from their two years of reconnaissance that they did not believe that the enemy had gathered hundreds of divisions, and that the maritime power had absolutely not gathered to the extent that they could land and fight a decisive battle.</p>
<p>Of course, it only takes five and a half hours to cross the strait, but the preparation before the operation takes four and a half hours. Germany is always preparing for this type of attack. The land is closely monitoring the enemy, covering the coast with a network of giant shells. No matter how secretly the enemy ships act on the other side of the strait, they cannot escape the eyes and ears of the electronic detectors. This new weapon is becoming more and more advanced today. The British navy cannot escape the perspective of this ultra-short wave even if it sticks cork pieces on the sides of ships or pours in artificial fog before landing.</p>
<p>The power of the parachutes also seems to be overestimated. At most, there are only four or five divisions. With this force, even if they can disrupt the rear, if they cannot establish contact with the sea, annihilation can be said to be a matter of time. In short, even if the enemy can invade France, the principle is to annihilate them within 24 hours. And in fact, it is absolutely impossible to carry out a surprise landing operation in the English Channel.</p>
<p>The strategy and propaganda planned by the British and Americans based on the quantity of their aircraft, weapons, and military power are not just fantasies, they are dangerous. Since the failure of the Dieppe landing operation, through the North African landing operation, the Italian operation, and other battles, the Anglo-American landing operation has accumulated a considerable number of years and paid a great sacrifice. They are eager to invade Europe to end the war, so they are actively preparing for the invasion. (Xiang: Translated from the May 28th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Increased Production Movement Implemented in Malaya</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Xiaoyang News Agency Telegram: The Japanese military government of Malaya met with a group of reporters here. On the issue of responding to the recent operations and strengthening military measures, they spoke as follows: Regarding the Malayan food problem, the goal for this year is to achieve complete self-sufficiency, and a comprehensive increase production movement will be launched, opening up wasteland and utilizing open spaces. The indigenous people can deeply understand the intentions of the authorities and enthusiastically cooperate. Regarding the import of rice, it has also been quite active recently, and the indigenous people have no sense of unease. At the current stage of rebuilding Malaya, the problem of insufficient labor has already become an extremely important issue. The lack of labor is one of the proofs that the overall construction cannot be progressed. On the other hand, the large-scale increase in volunteers is also one of the reasons for the lack of labor. Therefore, this year, it has been decided that in addition to transferring thousands of laborers from Java, it is necessary to promote a comprehensive labor mobilization plan. Regarding the fundamental policy towards the overseas Chinese, it has already been decided that they will first be actively supported and cooperated, because their economic strength has the potential to develop further. Assistance has now been provided for their free activities, so that they can move freely in the economic field, and the authorities will actively guide them in this regard. Regarding the price issue, it is planned to lend out hundreds of millions of yuan this year, but at present, in order to prevent inflation, various controls are being implemented in the financial field, stipulating the lending of funds and excessive purchasing methods. Also, recently, bank deposits and postal savings have increased sharply, which is a gratifying phenomenon, and can be said to be a major proof that the residents trust Japan.</p>

<p>Every day, there is always a flock of pigeons flying in the sky, flying. They appear from behind the opposite alleyway, pass over the narrow alleyway, sweep over the ridge of my house, make a circle on the nearby roof, and then appear again in the opposite alleyway. They circle around tirelessly all day long... Now, every time they sweep past my window, I see a few flexible black shadows, and my heart feels as heavy as if a lead weight has been added!</p>
<p>I remember that a month ago, the situation was completely different, and the pigeons gave me infinite joy. At that time, a friend of mine lived in the front building, and we both read and wrote silently all day long. What a monotonous life this was! Our spirits were so eager to be tempered by external things. But where could we find such things? There were no trees or flowers outside the window. It was impossible to find even a small grass. The patio was very small and piled high with stale and dilapidated sundries. There was not even room for one person to stroll. So we found the flock of pigeons, although their flight was silent and inconspicuous. Every day, there was always a time when the two of us sat side by side in front of the window, raised our heads, and watched the flock of pigeons soar back and forth. The fatigue of the day would be swept away from my body and mind, and there would be a kind of natural feeling.</p>
<p>One day, my friend suddenly jumped up. He said firmly:</p>
<p>"I can't be trapped in this cage-like place anymore, just watching them!"</p>
<p>A few days later, he left the front building with simple luggage, probably soaring freely. Only I was left behind, raising my head and staring foolishly at the flock of pigeons, sighing to myself!</p>
<p>"Oh! How much of a man's ambition have they awakened!"</p>
<p>But my ambition was never able to be aroused, and a sense of shame made me unwilling to see them again. I longed for them to disappear from in front of the window forever. But this made me recall the past again: just a few months ago, there were two children on the opposite side of the alleyway, holding slingshots made of rubber bands and shooting small pebbles at the flock of pigeons, startling them and causing them to fly around in chaos. For a long time, they did not dare to fly low, and even changed their flight paths. We were extremely angry at that time and, using the reason of a stone that accidentally fell in, started negotiations. Later, the flight of the pigeons returned to normal – flying low past the window. At this time, both of us felt a sense of satisfaction. Who knew that after a few months, I would not want to see them anymore.</p>
<p>Heaven seemed to be showing off its beauty, and for several days in a row, there was heavy rain, and they had to disappear from the sky. I should have been satisfied, but my heart began to feel empty. Not a single person was willing to talk to someone with such a strange temperament as me; although there were a few books on the shelf, looking at them on such a dark and gloomy day only made people feel bored. There were also pens and ink on the table, but as soon as I picked up the pen, I felt my brain become dull, and I put it down again after writing less than a line. So I stood up and paced back and forth. Life in Shanghai was complicated, but every two days were different scenes. The door to the front building was closed, and the sound of the heavy rain drowned out the sound of the back cards. The dripping sound of the rain had become so habitual to my ears that I was almost indifferent to it. My friend's bunk was still placed in the corner of the room, and I dared not look at it directly. I could only stare at the gray sky in a daze. I walked closer to the window. The narrow alleyway and the dilapidated houses were quietly in front of my eyes. The ugly and strange appearance of the past had disappeared in the vastness, and everything was as silent as death. This silence pierced my heart, and the emptiness in my chest gradually expanded, forming a bottomless and boundless abyss.</p>
<p>— I couldn't help but think of the flock of pigeons.</p>
<p>Finally, they reappeared in the sky, and I couldn't help but jump up from my chair, walk closer to the window, and silently pray for them:</p>
<p>May they always fly freely and incessantly. They are messengers of God; they give hope and comfort to the timid; at the same time, they also give ambition and courage to the strong. May they always soar in the free sky, and may their lively姿態 bestow wisdom and purity of the soul on people.</p>
<p>Until now, they are still the same, flying every day, day after day, along their usual route. And I, too, will never say that I don't want to see them anymore!</p>
<p>But now, my mood is finally different from before. Every day, when I sit in front of the window and watch them sweep past me – the black shadows flashing one after another – a bitter smile spreads across my face, and my heart feels as if a lead weight has been added, so heavy! -.</p>

<p>Swishing and swashing:</p>
<p>Are rushing forward mightily</p>
<p>Regardless of day and night,</p>

<p>We must make the vast future grand</p>
<p>And magnificent! Only by letting each of us become a sea wave of humanity!</p>
<h3>Father is Old</h3>
<p>— Yi Xuan</p>
<p>Is father old? I dare not believe it; if forty is said to be the beginning of a person's life's work, then fifty is like the sun at its zenith. I leaf through father's past photos and diaries, that handsome appearance, that striving life, all make me deny that father is old.</p>
<p>However, the facts tell me that whether it is his appearance, his thoughts, his will, everything is like the setting sun's fading glow.</p>
<p>Who caused him to be like this? Difficult years? No, the times can create heroes, and heroes can create the times, can't they? I think it is father's decadence that has aged himself.</p>
<p>When the first white hair appeared on his head, he sighed with sorrow, "I am old, I am useless!" So the second and third... quickly filled his temples; he sighed with even more sorrow, "I am old! I am useless! I have struggled all my life, it is time for me to put down the flag and silence the drums!"</p>
<p>It was an air-raid night, a red cloth with a black cloth lining was hung over the lamp, only the tabletop could receive the light, and father started playing the old tune again; I said:</p>
<p>"You are not old, if I reach father's age..." I stood up and pulled off the lamp cover: "Then, I will rely on my knowledge and experience, like this light illuminating the entire room."</p>
<p>He smiled and sighed weakly: "Ah, child's talk, if you were to reach my age, maybe you would be worse than me!"</p>
<p>"No, even if I live to be twice as old as father, I will never admit to being old, maybe my body will be hunched over, my head will be bald; but I will never let my spirit, my thoughts add ten years of age."</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen a body that does not age; youth that does not pass away? Father! You should perk up, you are still a champion of the three armies, now you are surrendering, not gloriously ceasing hostilities."</p>
<p>But my eloquent argument earned me the same answer: "I am old! I am useless!"</p>
<p>Who can tell me where the Queen Mother of the West's spiritual mountain is? Let me go and beg for a dose of immortality pills, and offer it to my father so he can have a youthful face and a youthful heart.</p>
<h3>Dusk</h3>
<p>— Fu Baosheng</p>
<p>A pile of yellow earth,</p>
<p>A bunch of fresh flowers,</p>
<p>Dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, recalling the mentor's demeanor, floating in the phantom, talking softly, reciting the past. If one contracted tuberculosis - my destruction is the remaining days of my life, the leaf inside exceeds the extreme amount - is the poison element, the suicide medium. Listen! Who is groaning in this dusk like a cuckoo crying, it is the mourner before the grave,</p>
<p>Reciting the past of the one destroyed by dusk.</p>
<p>A pile of yellow earth,</p>
<p>A bunch of fresh flowers,</p>
<p>Dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping over the outline of the tragedy!</p>
<p>Loss, raid, pacification, sorrow...</p>
<p>The elderly father suffered the raid, the bribes all became bubbles, thinking of years of cultivation, the one who repays! A pile of yellow earth, carrying the hopes of the second half of life, the one who obtains - a pile of yellow earth, the destroyer soon equally economically gives to the loving mother - is sick,</p>
<p>Sorrow - forging the weak younger sister.</p>
<p>A pile of yellow earth, a bunch of fresh flowers, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping over a certain dusk, he vanished completely with the setting sun, one day dawn reappears the setting sun in the east, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave. A pile of yellow earth, a bunch of fresh flowers, dusk reflects the mourner weeping before the grave, weeping as dusk passes by like flowing water,</p>
<p>He vanished in a certain dusk of the past,</p>
<p>Fading away in a certain dusk of the future. The dusk of the past, the dusk of the future,</p>
<p>The destroyer of the past and future is in the dusk.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>"Dream of the Red Chamber" from Novel to Film</h3>
<p>— Gu Xin</p>
<p>...“Dream of the Red Chamber” has finally come to the silver screen. It is said that “China Film” spent a lot of manpower and material resources to produce this film. They not only advertised it heavily beforehand, but also published many special issues after its public release.</p>
<p>...“Dream of the Red Chamber” is a lengthy novel with the theme of exposing the extravagance and licentiousness of feudal aristocratic families, ultimately leading to their decline. Although limited by the times, the writing style inevitably falls into clichés, its strengths are in its delicate and refined descriptions, and its vivid portrayal of characters. Various European and American countries often bring famous works to the stage or screen. From an artistic point of view, introducing this work to movie audiences is not a completely worthless endeavor.</p>
<p>...However, the adaptation work is not easy. It must not only avoid harming the original work, but also possess a proper and unique artistic skill. This time's "Dream of the Red Chamber" film, I dare not flatter, is a complete failure.</p>
<p>...The "Dream of the Red Chamber" film only adopted a long thread of triangular love between Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai from the original work, and crowned it with the slogan of "giving a head-on blow to the old marriage system," which is the first trick. But a loophole was forgotten: the original author's era did not have the so-called "old marriage" and "new marriage" at all; and even if Baoyu and Daiyu truly reunited, it would not necessarily represent a bright and beautiful union. The entire film's plot tries to incorporate lively and relatively well-known episodes, which is the second trick. However, the director's skills are indeed pitifully poor, and the joining of each section appears so stiff and unnatural. The abruptness of the camera shots, and the forced manner of the characters' entrances and exits, all make the audience feel that they cannot understand it without rereading the "Dream of the Red Chamber"! Most of the lines are based on the original work with slight "modernization," but when there is nothing to refer to in the original work, the poverty of ideas is revealed. The characters' personalities are all distorted, and there is no emotion to speak of.</p>
<p>...In fact, even if you put in a little more effort to make this novel into a film with some artistic value, you would not lose a few audience members.</p>

<h3>Sports Basketball Charity Tournament Final Match Central China Youth vs. Western China Youth Decisive Battle Tonight There Will Also Be a Performance by All-Shanghai Healthy and Beautiful Standard Men The Program Starts at 8 PM Followed by the Award Ceremony</h3>
<p>This newspaper's scholarship fund's basketball charity tournament will soon come to a successful conclusion after the final match begins tonight at 8 PM. This event was made possible by the Basketball Association, the Youth Association, and the cooperation of various teams, the generosity of General Manager Zhang Zixiang of China-United Pharmaceutical Factory in covering the expenses of the Central China Youth and Western China Youth teams, and the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life. The scholarship fund of this newspaper has benefited greatly, and the benefits to students in the future are also the blessings of people from all walks of life. Tonight's basketball final, along with the performance by healthy and beautiful men and the award ceremony, will undoubtedly be even more lively.</p>
<p>Central China and Western China Each Win Once Tonight's Final Decisive Battle</p>
<p>According to the rules of this basketball charity tournament, the Central China Youth and Western China Youth teams were invited to play a best-of-three series. The Central China team includes generals such as those from the China-United Pharmaceutical Team and He Jingui from South China. The Western China Youth team is a mixed team led by the giant Monroe, and both sides have strong players. In the first game (12th), the Central China Youth team fought alone with the China-United Pharmaceutical Team, and thanks to the efforts of the generals and the correct strategy, they achieved victory (23-18). In the second game (14th), the Central China Youth team was mainly composed of the Renyu team, supplemented by Zhang Jinzhen and He Jingui. Unfortunately, they were unlucky with the ball, and Lin Weiting also left the field due to a sprained ankle. In the end, Zhuo Guorong was fouled out four times, leading to a complete collapse and a crushing defeat (29-11). Now that each side has won once, tonight's battle is a matter of life and death, and both sides will certainly exert their full strength. It is heard that Zhang Zhixiang and Yu Junzi are studying the distribution of the lineup and the method of combat in order to achieve the effect of defeating the enemy, and the writer, being untalented, humbly offers his views.</p>
<p>Observing the Situation of the Foreign Generals My Views on Lineup Distribution</p>
<p>Observing the Western China Youth team's combat, their offensive method uses a V-shape. That is, after one person gets the ball, there are two people about five steps in front of him blocking the opponent's players, and these two people are also inevitably noticed by the opponent. The person with the ball then takes this opportunity to shoot from a distance, and uses the tall men Flunik and Yalong to follow up if the shot misses. Their defensive method adopts a strict man-to-man system. Relying on their sufficient strength and several years of experience, it is extremely effective. Understanding this, we should be able to know how to use our own strengths to attack the opponent's weaknesses. However, since the Central China Youth team has players from various teams, it is difficult to distribute the lineup. Moreover, basketball combat now tends to absolutely emphasize team cooperation, and it is impossible to dominate solely based on individual skills. The writer now believes that four generals from China-United should be used, supplemented by Ma Canxi or Yu Junzi from the Renyu team. If Ma Canxi is used, then Ma and Xi Lin should be guards, and Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xianlun, and Kong Guangyi should be forwards. The reason is that only one general in the five is a member of another team, which should not affect communication. However, some say that Ah Kong's position as a forward may not be satisfactory, and Mr. Zhang Zhixiang also has this view, which is reasonable. Ah Kong has been stationed in the backcourt for a long time, and if he is forced to serve as a forward, his position will inevitably be unfamiliar. However, I believe that Ah Kong can shoot, and is extremely steady, and since Canxi is quite capable of seizing opportunities to advance, then at that time Ah Kong can retreat as needed, so that there are no loopholes. If Ah Kong is really not accustomed to the front line, then Yu Junzi can serve as a forward, and Lao should be the guard, and Ah Kong and Xi Lin should team up. Yu Junzi can supply the ball on the front line, using his alertness to give Wu Chengzhang, Zhang Xian or Xi Lin the achievement of advancing. I wonder if Zhang and Yu also agree with my words? Therefore, some believe that the way for the Central China Youth team to defend should also be man-to-man, at least for a tactical system that raises the level of play. However, observing the strength of each individual and the very short practice time, I believe that in today's battle, they can only continue to use the more skilled (Zone). If they can stand in the correct position and pay attention to their V-shaped offensive tactics, and block their tall men from following up, I can guarantee that the foreign generals will lack development and have no recourse.</p>
<p>The Healthy and Beautiful Men's Performance is Worth Visiting</p>
<p>Tonight's basketball game is scheduled to start at 8 PM in the gymnasium of the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association, and in the middle there will be a human body performance by the winners of the Healthy and Beautiful Men's Competition organized by the Youth Association: Liu Ke, the first place winner, Huang Hui, the second place winner, and Mao Guanqing, the third place winner. In the past, there has never been such a competition in Shanghai, only the president and queen of flower countries and the school flowers of various schools. The focus is on eroticism, which is not enough to be a model. The one organized by the Youth Association this time is in line with science, combining the evaluations of medical scientists, the observations of artists, and the judgments of sports experts. According to Mr. Liang Zhaoan of the association: Overseas, this kind of performance is considered normal and is also very eye-catching, and the authorities give awards. And in fact, it is indeed very beneficial for arousing public interest, enhancing the national physique, and the nation. This is the first attempt in Shanghai, and the results are quite good. The selected winners certainly possess healthy beauty and a moral character with inner beauty. It allows people to know the standard of healthy beauty, and women can also understand how men can be called healthy and beautiful. Therefore, those who did not go to visit the previous competition should go to visit tonight. One trip can give you two kinds of artistic appreciation, which is a truly rare opportunity. It is predicted that tonight's grand occasion will undoubtedly surpass the previous two games. I hope people from all walks of life will go early so as not to regret missing it!</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Skill of the Tung Wah Football Team in the Scholarship Charity Football Match</h3>
<p>The Tung Wah vs. Overseas Chinese United football charity match for the scholarship fund was held last Friday (9th) at the racecourse football field. Because the audience admired the skills of the Tung Wah team, and the Overseas Chinese United team had four Tianjin generals to help, they rushed to the scene and the streets were deserted. The stands were packed, which was fortunate for the scholarship fund of this newspaper. In this game, Mr. Ru Lin Kanghou performed the opening ceremony, and Misses Li Xiangguan and Li Guihua presented the awards. Sincere gratitude is expressed to Tan Jing, Pan Sansheng, Shen Siliang, Zhou Wenrui, Zhou Jiaqi, Shen Jiongchun, all gentlemen, as well as the sports association, the football association, the police bureau, and other related people for their enthusiastic assistance.</p>
<p>Brief Account of the Battle</p>
<p>After the start of the match, the Overseas Chinese United team relied on the strength of their morale and attacked fiercely, constantly attacking the Tung Wah team. Fortunately, the rear defense of Zhuang and Li was tight, and they were spared from disaster. The Overseas Chinese United team only had attacks, but could not find their way in, and could only sigh in frustration. The Tung Wah generals, had a plan in mind, and remained quiet for a long time before acting. Han Chonghai went deep into the hinterland, and the opposing Luo Xulai tripped him and fouled, and a twelve-yard penalty kick was awarded, which was kicked in by Sun Jinshun. Less than two minutes later, the Tung Wah team, riding high on momentum, You Liang kicked a corner kick, which was headed by Zhang Lingen, and Li Kui headed it again, breaking the enemy's goal. One penalty and one header, double happiness came to the door. The Overseas Chinese United team, before the end of the first half, was awarded a twelve-yard penalty kick due to Zhang Banglun's foul, which was scored by Bao Jie. In the first half, the Tung Wah team won with a score of two to one. In the second half, the Overseas Chinese United team made a desperate gamble and launched a full-scale counterattack. In the end, they lacked shooting generals, and the number of offside balls was countless. Instead, Sun Jinshun of the Tung Wah team scored an empty goal. They overwhelmed the Overseas Chinese United team with generals with a score of three to one, maintaining the honorary title of this session, which was truly a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Commentary on Football Skills</p>
<p>The Tung Wah team was on the defensive for most of the match. Therefore, their defensive performance was measured and rhythmical. Their roundabout tactics were well-applied and had no gaps. Tan Fuji and Zhuang Youren were especially methodical. Only Zhang Lingen seemed to be out of sorts. Banglun's goalkeeping is gradually becoming miraculous, bold and meticulous, combining both. Little Zhang can humbly improve, and will definitely have achievements in the future. Some say that judging from his recent situation, he can surpass Liu Xianjue, which is no exaggeration. On this day, Tung Wah's attack was not seen as particularly brilliant. This is because Longhai ran too much, while Lao Sun was slightly lazy. For this reason, the front line failed to have the ideal connection. However, because they were aware of the agility of the opponent's goalkeeper, they never attacked the goal lightly. They used the best opportunity to break the enemy's goal lightly. The enemy's goalkeeper was left with no place to use his heroism, and regretted it endlessly. This was the success of wisdom and experience.</p>
<p>To discuss the Overseas Chinese United team's offensive strategy again, they only used the central breakthrough method, and did not know how to change. Especially since they lacked shooting generals. The reason why they could not get the ball is this. If they could make more use of the two wings and lengthen the front line, then the Tung Wah team's defense might not be able to last to the end and would have revealed fatigue early. Their willingness to run in their defensive tactics, and the briskness of their footwork, were admired by everyone. However, their position was rigid, and they only used positional play zone defense, which led to the hard work not being worth the effort. The Tung Wah team knew their weakness, and used the two wings to lure them, so that they had to show the shortcoming of losing sight of one thing while attending to another. The central defensive line could not give too much thought to the rear. This was truly undesirable.</p>
