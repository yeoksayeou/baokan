<h3 id="c1">「實業公司」時代 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>有一位中國人會說過：一九四二年既是中儲劵價值跌落年，那末一九四三年就是團積居奇年，一九四四年就是股票投機年。這句話，頗有細加玩味的價值。</p>
<p>所謂貨幣，是具有好多機能的，然而其中最重要者，或許就是物品交換媒介和價值保存兩個機能吧！貴金屬所以能當作貨幣使用者，就是由於交換方便，且不腐爛不減少，而易於保存價值。中儲券雖是物品交換的媒介物貨幣，然而從價值保存這一點上說，現在是非常不合適的。最近一百塊頭的儲鈔如擱置一個月不用，則起碼會丟失五分之一的價値。一個月前，一百元買兩担煤球，而今天或許一担也難責到手。CRB經不適於保存了。如擱置不用就會跌價的。這就是民眾痛苦的所在。所以，民眾就為使CRB不跌價，而拚命保存共價值，則購貿貨物。民眾就拚命追求物資，藉以代替具有價值保存機能的貨幣。然而民眾因為CRB的交換價值和實際價值問如此分離，則愈益不顧三七二十一地使CRB交換價值跌落，使自己的收入減少。例如民眾縱或知道這一點，而也不願看着自己所擁有的中儲劵價値，任其不翼而飛，所以就想把儲鈔價値鎖藏於囤積的　範裏。這正像用無底的桶汲水一樣。最盛行的囤積時代，由於強制收買棉紗棉布的發動，而暫吿一段落。然而最根本的物價騰貴趨勢，換言之，CRB價値跌落的起勢，當時雖稍是穩定，但仍然還是走上了舊道。於是，民眾對於自己手中所握有的CRB價値，就不能不早一時換取他一形態而保存。以前德國馬克跌落的時候，丈夫一領到薪水，而妻子早已在公司門外等候着，錢接到了手，立刻像長途賽跑似地，爭先恐後地去購買物品。現在的上海人，多少也有了這種類似的現象了。滿足民眾這種要求的，就是股票市塲。物品囤積時代之所以成為過去，這當然是統制的功勞，同時也是由於物價過高，而一般民衆早已無力接近物品市塲了。於是民眾就不得不向股票市場發展。股票市塲上的上市股票是有限的，如仍務這樣下去，是絕對不能適應這種廣大民眾要求的。於是雙眼獨具的聰明人們，便高高掛起「實業公司」，「营業公司」「企業公司」等美不勝收的金字扁額，而經營地產公司，其股票以最低廉的票面（普通十元），投於股票市塲。這便成為投面的絕好對象了。民衆並沒有充分時間去調查該地產公司是否眞有地產，只要看着價格要漲的股票就買（價格上漲的部份，乃是自己所持有的法幣價值跌落之部份）。此外，實業公司方面也大吹大擂地宜傳，捏造自己的　餘消息，以燭動民眾的投機狂。更在公司的　監事羣中，排列上上海著名實業家的大名，資本額用令人咋舌的巨款來眩耀世人。於是民眾認為如握有這樣公司的股票，就大可高枕無憂，縱使賣家財當衣服也想買進這類股票。給果，該實業公司的股票就驚人地飛漲起來。「實業公司」實際上就是等待這一機會的降臨。「實業公司」的「實業」，就從此而開始。</p>
<p>實業公司的發起人在成立最初，早就在手中握有全部股票的七成或八成，只把剩餘的二成或三成投於股票市塲。同時用盡所有宣傳方法，以煽動市塲人心。提供市塲的股票量少，自然多頭貿進者就多。因此該股票就扶搖直上，等待這一機會的實業公司，就把手中握有的股票，一下或遂漸空頭拋出，以謀巨利。市塲上股票的供給量又因此而增加，自然價格就會跌落，而營業公司便乘機再度買進，以求巨利。這種市塲上的吞吐不已，就是「營業公司」約眞正營業。這種吞吐過程的不斷重演，於是民眾的金錢，則像滔滔江河，源源流入營業公司的金庫。這决不是萬無一失的發財之道。民眾對於這種發財機構，無論知道與否，部因股粟市塲外別無適當投機對象，而又不願坐視自己握有的金錢價値逐漸消失，所以不得不買賣股票。於是結果，現本全上海的市民，甚要薪水階級，教員，店員，娘姨，工友，無不瘋狂於股票的多頭空頭中，每天報紙上刊佈的股要市價表，到處成為談話的資料。</p>
<p>我認識的一位教員，把自己的全部財產變賣成數萬元現鈔，而買進某種股票一千股，以買進賣出所賺的錢，彌補生活贊的不足。這位知識份子的他，很坦自地說：「我雖然知道貿賣股票，不久將成為破壞我生活的毒素，然而處於這樣高物價下，如不吃此毒素，則甚至目前暫時的生活也决難維持」。這就是普通小資產階級奔走於投機市楊的心理狀態。實業公司就是濫加利用這種可憐的民眾心理，而把民眾的血汙金錢，榨取而去。</p>
<p>現在大部分「實業公司」，其股票的市價與實際，都有極大的出入，且在本質上，都以投機操縱為唯一的營業。猶有甚者，即除此等實業公司以外，利用這個股票投機時代，營業公司以外的公司，各自利用自己的股票，經營買賣，在本質上，遂漸走向「實業公司」的道路。這種傾向在普遍化着，例如電影製片楊，地產公司，食品公司等，在積極於比製造影片，食品等更賺錢的增資，而發行股票，經營實賣；如熱中於這方面，中國的產業就會完全陷於停頓的吧！這種風氣逐漸一般化，誠是一件可怕的現象。</p>
<p>自然，早日抑正這種風氣，是南京國民政府刻不容緩的當前課題，政府當局業巳明瞭這種事態，所以最近才頒佈「實業公司」的禁令。這一點，希望政府澈底實行。</p>
<p>由於使法幣的價值日益跌落，使民眾愈益陷於經濟不安裏，假如公然准許利用這種不安，而為所欲為地掠奪民眾金錢，那末我們作最大的犧牲以反對美國金融資本的戰爭，就完全失掉意義。我們現在在亞洲，正用全力創造無自由主義掠奪的世界。為了達到這一目的，我們必須首先從上海剷除這種美國化的現象。然而一般人關於道個問題，在上海不斷地有許多傳說。例如在傳說着，新以兩萬萬元資本即將成立的某「實業公司」，擬用一萬元資本即將設立的某外國式賭博公司等，都與政府某某要人有密切關係之類。筆者相信，站在取締這種風氣立塲的政府要人，不應當有等於助長這種風氣的情形，如與分司發生關係。如不幸而言中，這比馬路上的巡捕勒索，是更大規模的，無廉恥的勒索了衆。我認為政府決不應當許可官吏有這樣的行動，這實在等　於國家的自殺行為。</p>
<p>有一位中國朋友對我說過以下的話。假如以最近三年的中國經濟動態比作　班，則一九四二年的法幣價格低落期為　　第一期，一九四三年的囤生凡期顯肺病第二期，而今年一九四四年的實業公司時代，則正如肺病第三期。假如這句話是對的話，今年則必須下決心治療，否則病家決不可救藥了。（魯譯）</p>

<p>東京五日中央社電敵美軍急欲展開正式之太平洋决戰，其反攻以去歲十一月中之吉爾貝特作戰為轉機，頓形熾烈，本年一月三十日敵復以基地航空部隊及以航空母艦戰艦為主幹之有力機動都隊，攻擊日內南洋馬紹爾羣島，對處奧特·庫埃茲林·渥寶·馬羅尼拉布·布拉溫等該羣島全域加以砲擊轟炸。　於二月一日在庫埃茲林及處奧特兩島登陸。按日內南洋海域包括馬紹爾羣馬卡羅林羣島及馬里亞那羣島以日本最廣大之基礎。海面敵美軍於現在之太平洋央戰中，無論採取任何之戰略，須以進攻日內南洋為正式之作戰。溯自參戰以來，美軍自所羅門羣島北上，突破連結於俾斯麥爾庫及新幾內亞之日戰略要綫，今正展開拉巴爾開戰史上空前未有之一大航空戰，連日因受日海軍機及陸海軍守備隊之邀擊，敵軍已蒙重創，價於一月內即損失飛機入百五十架，料今後敵之應大犧性常東形增加。敵美軍艦感「時間」有利日軍誠不能忽視以上之事實。敵以吉爾貝特羣島為中部太平洋上有力之作戰據點，屢次進攻日內南洋·為不使「時間」賦與日本以重大力量，乃急　展開此馬紹爾作戰，如此敵終進入西太平洋，日第一綫部隊會實行強力反繫，固不待言，而敵軍態接近日軍作戰要點地，犧牲愈形增大，此自過去數次之波根維爾島海面空戰觀之之攻擎，顯係已考盧及此等間題，故日內南洋之戰局，實具有從例不有之深刻性，現太平洋戰局正以異常之速　。向决戰途上一突進中。</p>

<p>東京五日中央社電眾院五日召開全體會議，通過「必勝决議案」時，東條首相會起立致詞，表明日政府完成戰爭之堅固信念，其大意謂：適纔全體會議一致通過必勝决議案，洵堪欣慰，今戰局日形熾烈，今日實决定皇國興廢與大東亞之盛襄之秋，故此際爭取勝利之途，惟有我一億國民確信正義戰爭必獲勝利，繼續集結總力，繼續奮鬥，以底於成。因此，政府决講求一種措置，將一億國民總力作最有效之集中，於增強戰力方面，余前次在本議場已言及，其宣行辦法自政府决不拘於過去所為，應採取者，决予採取，應改革者，决予改革，以期充分發揚戰時下國民之忠誠，此點尤願諸君作積極之協力。值此皇國危急之秋，諸君代表國民，而有此種熱烈决意之表現，政府實深感激，諸君勝科之關鍵，端在一億國民之團結，余深望我官民一致協力，集結總力，增強戰力，從速擊減英·美，以安聖慮。</p>

<p>南京五日中央社電日駐華派遣軍四日發表週間戰況如次：本週渝軍殆無戰意與行動，日軍除仍繼續展開各地肅淸討伐戰外，自全面視之，各戰綫均無可特記之戰事，此足證大陸方面之日軍戰略態勢，愈益充實。反之，更可證明渝方前於日軍之常德進攻作戰時，因蒙受潰減之損醫，及各戰域之全面敗戰，故其抗戰力於物心兩面，顯已蒙相當之打擊。又駐渝美空軍因遭日軍速績攻擊，損害甚大，故最近渝美空軍，積極實施空軍之整備與補充，今後其動向，與敵呼號之緬甸反攻，及對日本空襲等，均値注目云。</p>

<p>— 周佛海</p>
<p>大陸新報把往矣集譯成日文出版，耍我寫幾句話做序文，因此引起我不少的感想，特為拉雜寫出，聊常作日譯本的序。</p>
<p>往矣集的產生和銷行的迅速，都是出發意料之外的。朱樸之兄主辦古今半月刊，屢次催我作文，辭不得已寫成「苦學記」去應付。起初不過應付文價而已，决沒有把半生的經歷，完全追述出來的計衝和意思。嗣後仍經不起各友的催請，不期然而然的寫成了幾篇，然而仍舊沒有出單行本的意思。湊巧古今社要出叢書，樸之想把這幾篇文章，當做業書第一種，印行單行本。他把這個意思，來和我商量，我便無可無不可的表示沒有異議。「往矣集」這個名詞，也是他取的。這本小冊子，就這樣的產生了。</p>
<p>出版之後，在一年之內，竟出到第入版。這雖然此不上民國十七年我出版「三民主義之理論的體系」時的盛況，但是在近數年來的出版界中，也可以說是稀有的現象。價使國家統一，銷行的地區較廣的話，大概銷行的數目，比現在還要增加。這本小冊子，竟這樣受歡迎，也是出我意料之外的。</p>
<p>去年十一月在東京的時候，聽說我的朋友日本名記者吉岡六文氏，要把這本小冊子譯成日文，在東京日日新聞社出版。不知道究竟辦了沒有。本來古今半月刋每次發表我的文章時，上海大陸新報大概都譯成日文，遂日發表過了的。這次該報社把已經譯過的加以補充，出版單行本去應世。於是往矣集的日譯本也就此產生了。</p>
<p>往矣集的內容，不過就我個人半生的經歷，信手追述出來，附帶發一些感慨罷了。在我看起來，實在沒有甚慶意義，更談不到有甚麼價值，何以會為中外人士所愛讀，我自己實在不知道是甚麼原因</p>
<p>根據我親自的經騐，深信一件事茱的成功，固然要繫於時代，環境和機會等多方面的條件，但是人的努力，乃是各種條件中的基本條件。如果不知或者不去努力，就是處着好的時代，有着好的環境，遇着好的機會，也不知道因利乘便的央運用，白讓有順利的時機空空的過去。反過來說，如果知道而且肯去努力，不僅可以運用遭遇着的既存的順利時機，而且可以去創造，去轉變。所謂「英雄造時勢」，所謂「人定勝天」，就是這個道理。我的經歷中間，有三個過程，可以證明這個道理。</p>
<p>第一是共產黨的組織。共產黨的是非善惡，我們現在姑且不論。但是他已成為中國政治上，社會上的一種力量，却是不可抹煞的事實，當民國九年我和陳仲甫及吳庭茨基在上海討論發起組織共產黨的時候，全國參加的，不到三十個人，而且都是手無寸鐵的書生。當時都不過僅憑血氣之勇，盲目　幹。那褒知道不到五年，便成功了一個很大的力量，雖然因為以後的領導方針錯誤，在中國讓成了許多破壞的行動，但是誰也不能不承認他是一種力量，是中國今後極難解决的一個問題。而其起原，就是二十幾個醫生的蠻幹。</p>
<p>第二是北伐。民國十三四年的革命運動的內外環境，我在本冊內會經述過。當時革命基礎，風雨飄搖，能夠維持廣州做革命的根據地，已經是很不容易的問題。那裏還想到能夠北伐，那裏還想到能夠北伐成功。然而在第一二次東征和消減楊劉以後，居然北伐了。居然於北伐軍興以後，不到三年，中國全國，就統一於中國國民黨的勢力之下了。當時軍閥的勢力，數十倍於革命勢力，他們有着優良的軍事裝備，維厚的物質力量，和巨大的兵力。但是他們沒有苦　蠻幹的精神，所以雖然擁有這些雄厚的力量而不能運用。革命軍的物質的條件，雖然遠邏於軍閥，但是有着百折不撓，勇往直前的蠻幹精神。這種精神，可以補足物質的缺陷而有餘。所以能夠以寡克衆，以弱勝強。北伐完成之迅速，竟出當時預料之外</p>
<p>第三是和平遝動，慚愧得很，全面和平尚未完成，國家統一猶待努力，所以我們米能以為和平遝動，已達到最後的成功，但是部也不能說和平運動，絲毫沒有成就。我們要論和平運動有無成就，要先看看和平運動發生當時的中國內外的環境。和平運動，是發生於二十七年下半年的。當時廣州，武漢，相繼陷落，英美袖手旁觀，徒以道德的同情，精神的援助來慰務。全國總崩潰的形勢，迫於眉睫。在這種情形之下，朝野上下，都希望能夠恢復蘆溝構事變以前的狀況，但是朝野上下，又都覺得這種希望，决不能實現。在常時的情形之下，誰夢想得到國民政府能夠還都，靑天白日旗能夠再飄揚於紫金山下！誰夢想得到能夠取消治外法權，收回租界！誰夢想得到能夠辦到日本於和平成立，立即全部撤兵，甚至放棄辛丑條約所規定的華北駐兵權！在常時的情形之下，都認為决不能辦到的事，我們都辦到了！此恢復蘆溝橋事變前的狀況，還要進步了！假使我們退回到二十七年下半年常時和此後的地位，來觀察現在的情形，能夠說和平運動毫無成就嗎？至於後來國際形勢的變化，人不是神仙，誰能預料！所以說和平運動，未竟全功則可，說和平運動毫無成就，實在是抹煞華實的昧心之諭。但是能夠得到這一點點小成就的和平運動，在當時發動的時候，實在不滿十人。以毫無憑藉的不滿十人，竟能做到現在這個局面，也可見得事在人為了。</p>
<p>根據個人所經壓的上述三個階段，足見一件事業的成敗，雖然也繫於時勢的順逆，環境的善惡，但是人的努力，却是基本的因素。回顯過去，瞻念將來，今後的環境，恐怕要　益惡劣，愈益危險，但是我們只要抱着「紮硬寨。打死仗」的决心，同時出以因時制宜的運用，我相信是無堅不摧，無險不克的。</p>
<p>閑着無事，也常把自己所寫的經過，拿來閱讀。這個半生，雖然也經歷了不少的崎嶇險阻，遭遇了不少的驚濤駭浪，但是能夠得到現在這個成就，己經是躊路滿志了。我自己常常退回到窮苦　生的地位，思察現在我所處的境遇，在個人，竇己心滿意足。因為在過去幾次偉大的運動中，都能參加工作，在現在這樣危難的局面之下，又能為國家負一部分責任，决不是我始料所及的，就個人說，一直到現在止，既然可以說是有了相當的成就，所以今後不單是得失榮枯，在所不計，就是生死存亡，亦豈在意中！人生一世，草生一秋，自問對於此生，沒有甚麼辜負</p>
<p>不過人的意思，是隨着環境燮遷的。在甚麼地位，就自然而然的發生適應這個地位的責任觀念。不是我要寫好聽的官樣文章，來欺世騙俗，因為我現在已不是窮苦　生了。我現在是和平運動的一個主要幹部，是國家一部分任務的當局。所以我覺得對於國家，對於民族，甚至對於東亞，還有朱盡的資任，未了的事業。將來的環境，是不是容許我盡道個責任，了這個事業，以及我自己是不是有這樣的能力，那都是另外的問題；但是無論有怎樣大的掀天撼地的波浪，汹涌澎湃起來，不管成功也好，成仁也好，我央心以我渺小一身來當，決不作逃避責任的卑怯動。</p>
<p>友邦日本的讀者，讀國這小，冊子，對於我過去的苦學和奮鬥，當然可以得到相當的了解。但是我希望友邦讀者更要了解中國規在，和我常年一樣苦學奮鬥的資年，有成千成萬。這些靑年，將來都是中國的棟樑，東亞的柱石。我希望日本的靑年和中國的這些資年，互相了解，互相提機，眞正的新東亞，緩能建設起來。</p>
<p>最後，對於大陸新報翻譯並印行這本小冊子，表示謝意。（轉載古今半月刊第四十期）</p>

<p>— 岩田豐雄著洪　洪羊譯</p>
<p>四號學生（一）</p>
<p>天文館大街，在東京好比銀座。在大阪好比道頓堀。道兩旁都有街燈，有電影院。喫茶店。書舖等大商店。雖說是鹿兒島的學生，也不是木石做的，時常也要到這條街上來。</p>
<p>一到正午雖然還早一點兒，我們到山形屋去吃西餐吧？」隆夫這樣地勸着眞人</p>
<p>「我是什麼也不喜歡吃。」眞人毅然地拒絕了，山形屋百貨店的西餐室，七高的學生雖然時常出入，但是眞人部以為不是中學生可以去的地方。</p>
<p>「但是——我已經餓了。」</p>
<p>「那麼吃甚麽好？」</p>
<p>「我們買三勇士饅頭吧，」眞人提出了這樣的答案。那時候在街路旁邊有賣這種饅頭的小販。隆夫買滿了一大袋子來。「今天收音機好像停止了似的。」饅頭舖的老掌履也這樣的說着。</p>
<p>二人毫不介意地走向天保山的路上去了。因為在人面前不好意思吃東西，所以要到那最熱習的海岸上去。坐在松樹下的砂灘上，二人吃了滿腹的饅頭。這確是一個古怪的祝賀會。</p>
<p>「我看大隅山很淸楚——為我治療近視，竟　些遠景的曁圖呢。「降夫最得意圖畫，所以他家裹有油畫的器具。</p>
<p>直到傍晚，他們二人纔回家來。在眞人的家裹，母親同姊姊也談着，收音機壤了的話。那沉默的收音機，在夜裹八點多鐘，突然地說起話來了。「二月二十六日午後八時十五分陸軍省發表——本日午前五時許，一部靑年將校等……」</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>對這震動全國的大事件，眞人經到了思索那究竟是「爲什麽」的年齡了。但是無論怎樣思索，也不能十分明瞭。這也難怪他，連東京第一流的評論家，也有到最近好容易才明白了的，所以在南方僻地隆摩的中學生·是不會分了解的但是，細想起來，這爲甚麽近來是陸續不斷地發生着。在前月十六日日本退出了第二次倫敦會議，也是一個例證。這個「爲甚麼」好像是能明白一半似地，所以眞人愈加焦躁，同時這間題是與自己志願的海盜有關係，所以更放心不下</p>
<p>「先生，這和退出國際聯盟有關係麽？才」在星期日訪問緒方先生家時，這樣的問着。「嘿…………」不喜歡學生關心政治問題的緒方先生·現着難看的面孔。忽然想到眞人是海兵的合格者，心情又轉變了。「我也不很明白，事情確實是很重大的。三年前開過預備會議，山本五十六中將為全權代表主張過反對華盛頓條約的繼續，那正是退出國際聯盟的第二年，在那時已經暗雲瀰漫着……」</p>
<p>「唉。」山本五十六提督的名字，眞人這時第一次聽到。</p>
<p>「像這　事·我是外行·校長先生是歷史家·很注意的。一切都是從校長先生傳聞得來的……」</p>
<p>華盛頓條約的五·五·三·比率，就是這管結的淵源，為減輕這種痛苦而努力，便是第一偷敦會議的日本的熊度。補助艦對美七成以上，潛水艦保持自主的現存數量，大型巡洋艦對美六成以上！這便長日本的主張。可是終於以華盛頓條約為基本，附加着幾個無意義的條件，而成立了。第一這條約是暫時議定的，到今年（昭和十一年）就要滿期，所以日本也忍痛班贊成了·</p>
<p>然而期限一滿，間劉就嚴重了。所以英米打成一片來舉行這第二次倫敦會議。這時日本的態度，已經和從前不同了。淸算過去的軍縮會議，規定各國保有量的最大限度，確立各國不威脅不侵略的態勢——這種態度，已經不是追隨他人之後的。已經不是要求幾成的那棟卑賤的話了。這是積極的發言。在這兒有很大的轉變。</p>
<p>英美當然反對這主張，因此日本就毅然地退出了這會議。比方是一個人，若不是很有自信的時候，決不會採取這種態度的。</p>
<p>「所以今後是無條約時代——谷君，擬正是作了無條約時代的海軍軍人！</p>
<p>眞人對這個爲甚麽已經完全了解了。</p>

<h3 id="c46">保甲長也有苦衷 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 魯分</p>
<p>看了二月四日申報國民論搜，東來君所作之「整頓保甲曰警制」一文，我不得不說兩句話。我是盧家灣保甲區內的一個聯保辦事員，所以對於保甲的情形比較淸楚一點。</p>
<p>東來君文中首先指摘保甲長，狐假虎威，不遵照政府意指，量情即理，給予民衆對於値勤時間相當使利。但是，要知道聯保處在支派值勤時間時，並不知某人在某時間內有空，某人在某時間內有公務。更有在旅館或公寓服務者，分日夜班，在本星期內上午有空，下星期中下午有空，所以派崗時只能按照保甲戶的先後依次排進，難免不與居民的工作時間相衝突。如果，經居民聲明在先，無不遵照辦理。如果在接到通知單，而不立即聲明、延誤時日，以至不及更調他人服務，當然不予准許了·</p>
<p>例如，在本聯保內，值勤通知單總是預先十天左右發出，居民對值勤時間有何異議，在五天前提出，還來得及更調。不過，等到值崗前一天來要求更改時間，那就只好對不住，不能准許。</p>
<p>至於，東來君所說的不能相商，其目的在乘機敲詐，，迫其出錢倔人代崗，也非盡然，在盧家灣軍中，民警若僱人代崗，除罰金外，要要禁止自由四小時。查崗者除保甲長外，尙有警局巡邏隊，故查獲者日有數起；若保甲長逼居民出錢倔人代崗，一經查出，責任由何人來負？所以說，保田長不能通融更改值崗時間，實在有不得已的苦衷。</p>
<p>根據政府規定，公務員醫生敎員所生，可以免際自警團之服役，在聯保內，居民衆多，良莠不齊，未免無冒名假借，希圖逃避服役，在本聯保相鄰的一個聯保內，就有一個靠妻子做舞女生活的人，當他接到值動單時，就聲明是某學校內的敎員，經警司調查之下，方才查明是虛的，所以凡是有正式證明文件呈繳來的，總可准許，如是空口說白話，不能繳出證明書的就不得免役了。</p>
<p>老實說，在我這一聯保中，團員達二千五百人之多，警亭崗位只有三個，差不多要三個月方才輸到三小時的服役。而保長每九天要值日一次，甲長每十八天要值班一次，呌苦速天，都說情願不做保甲長，而做自警團，所以，我說最好大家開誠佈公，討論一下，對值崗時間之支配，取得合理解决，就不會你怨我恨了。</p>
<p>最後，得聲明腐化份子並不是沒有。對於腐化份子，藐視功令，是深望當局力以取締，對於一般的保甲長，不要一視同仁，如同寃家對頭才好。</p>

        <h1>1944.02.06</h1>
<h3 id="e1">The Era of "Industrial Companies" <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>A Chinese person once said: "1942 was the year the Central Reserve Bank notes (CRB) lost their value, 1943 was the year of hoarding and speculation, and 1944 will be the year of stock speculation." This statement is worthy of careful consideration.</p>
<p>Currency, so-called, has many functions, but perhaps the most important are its two functions as a medium of exchange and a store of value! Precious metals can be used as currency because they are easy to exchange, do not rot or diminish, and easily preserve value. Although Central Reserve Bank notes (CRB) are a medium of exchange, they are currently very unsuitable for preserving value. Recently, if one hundred dollar notes are left unused for a month, at least one-fifth of their value is lost. A month ago, one hundred dollars could buy two loads of coal, but today it may be difficult to buy even one. CRB is no longer suitable for preservation. If left unused, its value will decrease. This is the source of the people's suffering. Therefore, in order to prevent the value of CRB from decreasing, people desperately try to preserve its value by purchasing goods. People frantically pursue materials to replace currency, which serves as a store of value. However, because the exchange value of CRB is so divorced from its actual value, people recklessly disregard the consequences and cause the exchange value of CRB to plummet, reducing their own income. For example, even if people are aware of this, they are unwilling to watch the value of their Central Reserve Bank notes disappear into thin air, so they want to lock up the value of their savings in the realm of hoarding. This is like using a bottomless bucket to draw water. The most prevalent era of hoarding temporarily came to an end due to the forced purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. However, the fundamental trend of rising prices, or in other words, the momentum of the CRB value falling, although slightly stabilized at that time, still returned to the old path. As a result, people have to exchange the CRB value in their hands for another form as early as possible in order to preserve it. In the past, when the German Mark fell, as soon as the husband received his salary, the wife would already be waiting outside the company gate. Upon receiving the money, she would immediately rush to buy goods like a long-distance runner, competing to be the first. The people of Shanghai today also have somewhat similar phenomena. What satisfies the people's needs is the stock market. The era of hoarding goods has passed, which is of course due to the control, and also because prices are too high, and the general public has long been unable to approach the goods market. Therefore, the people have to turn to the stock market. The listed stocks on the stock market are limited. If things continue like this, it is absolutely impossible to meet the demands of such a large public. So, smart people with unique vision hung up "Industrial Company," "Business Company," "Enterprise Company," and other beautiful golden plaques, and operated real estate companies, with the lowest face value of their stocks (usually ten dollars), throwing them into the stock market. This became an excellent target for speculation. The public does not have enough time to investigate whether the real estate company actually owns real estate, as long as they see the price of the stock is going to rise, they buy it (the part of the price increase is the part of the value of their legal tender that has fallen). In addition, industrial companies also exaggerate and fabricate false news to stir up the public's speculative frenzy. Furthermore, they put the names of famous Shanghai industrialists in the company's board of directors, and flaunt the company's capital with staggering sums of money. As a result, the public believes that if they hold shares in such a company, they can rest easy, and they even sell their family property and pawn their clothes to buy such stocks. As a result, the stock of the industrial company soared astonishingly. The "industrial company" is actually waiting for this opportunity to come. The "industry" of the "industrial company" starts from here.</p>
<p>The initiators of the industrial company already hold 70% or 80% of all the shares in their hands when the company is first established, and only throw the remaining 20% or 30% into the stock market. At the same time, they use all possible publicity methods to stir up the market sentiment. The supply of stocks in the market is small, so naturally there are more bulls buying. Therefore, the stock soars. The industrial company, which has been waiting for this opportunity, sells the stocks it holds, either all at once or gradually, to seek huge profits. The supply of stocks on the market increases as a result, and the price naturally falls, so the business company takes the opportunity to buy them again to seek huge profits. This constant buying and selling in the market is the true business of the "business company". With the constant repetition of this buying and selling process, the public's money flows into the treasury of the business company like a torrential river. This is by no means a foolproof way to get rich. Whether the public knows about this wealth-generating mechanism or not, they have no other suitable investment targets outside the stock market, and they are unwilling to sit idly by and watch the value of their money gradually disappear, so they have to buy and sell stocks. As a result, virtually all Shanghai citizens, especially salaried workers, teachers, shop assistants, maids, and laborers, are crazy about the bullish and bearish trends in stocks. The stock market price list published in the newspaper every day has become a topic of conversation everywhere.</p>
<p>A teacher I know sold all his property for tens of thousands of dollars in cash and bought 1,000 shares of a certain stock to make up for the shortfall in his living expenses by buying and selling. This intellectual frankly said, "Although I know that trading stocks will soon become a poison that destroys my life, under such high prices, if I don't eat this poison, it will be difficult to maintain even my temporary life." This is the psychological state of the average petit bourgeoisie running around in the speculative market. The "industrial companies" are abusing this pitiful psychology of the people and squeezing out the people's blood-stained money.</p>
<p>At present, the market price of most "industrial companies" stocks is very different from their actual value, and in essence, they only engage in speculative manipulation as their sole business. What is even more serious is that, in addition to these industrial companies, other companies, taking advantage of this era of stock speculation, use their own stocks to engage in buying and selling, and gradually move towards the path of "industrial companies" in essence. This tendency is becoming widespread. For example, film production companies, real estate companies, food companies, etc., are actively issuing stocks and engaging in real selling in order to raise capital, which is more profitable than producing films, food, etc. If they are enthusiastic about this aspect, China's industry will be completely paralyzed! This trend gradually becoming generalized is a terrible phenomenon.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is an urgent task for the Nanjing National Government to curb this trend as soon as possible. The government authorities have already realized this situation, so they recently issued a ban on "industrial companies." This is something that the government should thoroughly implement.</p>
<p>By causing the value of legal tender to fall day by day, and making the people more and more trapped in economic insecurity, if we openly allow this insecurity to be used to plunder the people's money as one pleases, then the war in which we are making the greatest sacrifices to oppose American financial capital will completely lose its meaning. We are now in Asia, using all our strength to create a world free from liberal plunder. In order to achieve this goal, we must first eradicate this Americanized phenomenon from Shanghai. However, there are many rumors about this issue in Shanghai. For example, there are rumors that a certain "industrial company" that is about to be established with a new capital of 20 million yuan, and a certain foreign-style gambling company that is about to be established with a capital of 10,000 yuan, are closely related to certain important government officials. I believe that government officials who stand in a position to ban this trend should not have a situation that is equivalent to promoting this trend, such as being involved with these companies. If I am unfortunately right, this is a larger-scale and more shameless extortion of the public than a street patrolman's extortion. I believe that the government should never allow officials to take such actions, which is tantamount to national suicide.</p>
<p>A Chinese friend once said to me the following. If we compare the recent three years of China's economic dynamics to a class, then the period of falling legal tender prices in 1942 was the first period, the period of hoarding in 1943 was the second period, like a lung disease, and the era of industrial companies this year, 1944, is like the third stage of lung disease. If this statement is correct, then we must be determined to treat it this year, otherwise the patient will be incurable. (Translated by Lu)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Fierce Battle in the Marshall Islands, Japanese Army Launches All-Out Counterattack; Over 100 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in Raids on Rabaul <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11:00 AM on the 5th: 1. The war situation in the Marshall Islands area is as follows: A. Since January 30th, the enemy has used its base air force and a powerful mobile force with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force to continuously attack Kwajalein, Wotje, Maloelap, and other islands throughout the Marshall Islands, and landed on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands on February 1st. The Imperial Navy Air Force and the Army and Navy garrisons in the area launched an all-out counterattack against the enemy forces. As of February 1st, a total of 52 enemy aircraft were shot down, 24 were destroyed, 2 enemy destroyers were sunk, and 1 enemy cruiser and 1 enemy destroyer were damaged. Because the Army and Navy garrisons on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands fought bravely, they have repelled part of the landing enemy forces, and fierce fighting continues to secure the defended areas. B. In the Solomon Islands area, many enemy aircraft raided Rabaul yesterday. The Imperial Air Force and the Army and Navy garrisons in the area immediately launched a counterattack. On the morning of January 29th, 257 enemy aircraft raided twice, and 39 were shot down, including 17 unconfirmed. 5 of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 30th, approximately 290 enemy aircraft raided twice, and 73 were shot down, including 19 unconfirmed. 1 of our aircraft did not return. On the morning of January 31st, approximately 180 enemy aircraft raided, and 14 were shot down, including 4 unconfirmed. 2 of our aircraft did not return.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Pacific War Situation: Advancing Rapidly Towards a Decisive Battle; American Military Casualties Expected to Be Enormous <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – The enemy American forces are eager to launch a formal decisive battle in the Pacific. Their counter-offensive, which took a turn with the Gilbert Islands operation in mid-November of last year, has become fierce. On January 30th of this year, the enemy again used its base air force and a powerful mobile force with aircraft carriers and battleships as its main force to attack the Japanese-mandated South Seas Marshall Islands, bombarding Kwajalein, Wotje, Maloelap, and other islands throughout the archipelago. They landed on Kwajalein and Wotje Islands on February 1st. The Japanese-mandated South Seas sea area, including the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, and Mariana Islands, constitutes Japan's most extensive base. In the current Pacific War, no matter what strategy the enemy American forces adopt, attacking the Japanese-mandated South Seas is a formal operation. Since entering the war, the American forces have moved north from the Solomon Islands, breaking through the Japanese strategic line linking the Bismarck Archipelago and New Guinea. They are now launching an unprecedented large-scale air battle in the history of the Rabaul battle. Due to the counterattacks of Japanese naval aircraft and Army and Navy garrisons, the enemy has suffered heavy losses. It is estimated that they lost 150 aircraft in January alone, and it is expected that the enemy's great sacrifices will increase even more. The enemy American fleet feels that "time" favors the Japanese army and cannot ignore the above facts. The enemy took the Gilbert Islands as a powerful operational base in the central Pacific and repeatedly attacked the Japanese-mandated South Seas in order to prevent "time" from giving Japan significant strength, and is now rapidly launching this Marshall Islands operation. In this way, the enemy will eventually enter the West Pacific, and the Japanese frontline forces will implement a strong counter-offensive. It goes without saying that as the enemy approaches the Japanese operational points, the sacrifices will become greater. This can be seen from the sea and air battles off Bougainville Island several times in the past. It is clear that these issues have been considered. Therefore, the war situation in the Japanese-mandated South Seas is unprecedentedly profound. The current Pacific war situation is unusually fast. Advancing towards a decisive battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Chuten News Agency) – Since the beginning of this year, in one month, the total number of enemy aircraft that raided Rabaul reached 3,215. Japanese naval aircraft and ground garrison units shot down a total of 856 enemy aircraft, accounting for approximately 26% of the number of aircraft that raided. The battle results were remarkable. During the same period, the Japanese side also lost 64 aircraft.</p>

The sanitary facilities are extremely complete, such as hospitals, dental clinics, and infectious disease prevention injections, all of which are available. In addition, there are entertainment facilities and plenty of writing time. I inspected the camp in Korea, and the situation was as good as in Fengtian.</p>

The gist of his speech was: It is gratifying that the plenary session has just unanimously passed the Resolution for Certain Victory. Today's war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Today is the autumn to decide the rise and fall of the Empire and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the only way to strive for victory at this time is for our 100 million citizens to believe that the righteous war will surely be won, to continue to gather all our strength, and to continue to struggle to the end. Therefore, the government has decided to seek a measure to concentrate the total strength of the 100 million citizens most effectively. Regarding strengthening military power, I mentioned this in this chamber last time. The government will never be bound by what it has done in the past in its methods of declaration. It will resolutely adopt what should be adopted and resolutely reform what should be reformed in order to fully develop the loyalty of the people in wartime. In this regard, I especially hope that you will provide active cooperation. At this time of the Empire's crisis, your representatives of the people have shown such a fervent determination, and the government is deeply grateful. The key to your victory lies in the unity of the 100 million citizens. I deeply hope that our officials and people will work together to gather all our strength, strengthen our military power, and defeat Britain and the United States as soon as possible to reassure the Emperor.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese garrison in China announced the weekly war situation on the 4th as follows: This week, the Chongqing army has almost no intention to fight or take action. In addition to continuing to carry out cleansing and suppression battles in various places, the Japanese army has no particularly noteworthy battles on any front from a general perspective. This is sufficient to prove that the strategic posture of the Japanese army on the mainland is becoming more and more complete. On the contrary, it can further prove that the Chongqing side suffered heavy losses during the Japanese army's Changde offensive operation, and its resistance force has been significantly hit in terms of both material and spiritual aspects due to the overall defeat in various battle areas. In addition, the US air force stationed in Chongqing has suffered great damage due to the Japanese army's successive attacks. Therefore, recently, the Chongqing US air force has been actively implementing the maintenance and replenishment of the air force. In the future, its movements, as well as the enemy's so-called counter-offensive in Burma and air raids on Japan, will all be worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities in Changde announced on the 4th that the German army on the Eastern Front had achieved great results, the main points of which are as follows: The Soviet army on the Eastern Front continues to launch fierce attacks, relying on its large number of troops. The German army has launched an extremely fierce defensive battle in response. However, due to the sudden warming of the weather on the Eastern Front, most of the battlefields are muddy and mechanized troops are unable to operate, making combat extremely difficult. In important areas, the Soviet army is constantly deploying new troops to make efforts to attack, but attempts to break through the German lines or encircle and annihilate the German army have been unsuccessful. In areas where the Soviet pressure is strengthened, the German army retreats to new rear positions and launches fierce counterattacks to crush the Soviet army's attempts.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Preface to the Japanese Translation of "Wang Yi Ji" <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Fohai</p>
<p>The Continental News has translated "Wang Yi Ji" into Japanese and is publishing it. They asked me to write a few words as a preface, which has aroused many thoughts in me. Therefore, I am writing this miscellaneous piece as a preface to the Japanese translation.</p>
<p>The creation and rapid circulation of "Wang Yi Ji" were both unexpected. Brother Zhu Puzhi, who runs the "Gu Jin" bi-monthly magazine, repeatedly urged me to write articles, and I reluctantly wrote "Ku Xue Ji" (Record of Bitter Studies) to cope with it. At first, it was just to earn the writer's fee, and I had no intention of completely recounting my life's experiences. Later, I still couldn't resist the requests of my friends, and I wrote a few more articles, but I still had no intention of publishing a separate book. Coincidentally, Gu Jin Publishing House wanted to publish a series of books, and Puzhi wanted to use these articles as the first book in the series, publishing them as a separate book. He discussed this idea with me, and I expressed no objection. The title "Wang Yi Ji" was also his idea. This small book was thus created.</p>
<p>After its publication, it went through its sixth edition within a year. Although this cannot be compared to the success of "The Theoretical System of the Three Principles of the People" that I published in 1928, it can be said to be a rare phenomenon in the publishing industry in recent years. If the country were unified and the circulation area were wider, the number of copies sold would probably increase even more. The popularity of this small book was also unexpected.</p>
<p>Last November, when I was in Tokyo, I heard that my friend, the famous Japanese journalist Mr. Yoshioka Rokumon, was going to translate this small book into Japanese and publish it in the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun. I don't know if he ever did it. Originally, every time "Gu Jin" bi-monthly magazine published my articles, the Shanghai Continental News would translate them into Japanese and publish them daily. This time, the newspaper supplemented the already translated articles and published them as a separate book. Thus, the Japanese translation of "Wang Yi Ji" was produced.</p>
<p>The content of "Wang Yi Ji" is just a casual recounting of my personal experiences over the past half-century, with some accompanying feelings. In my opinion, it really has no great significance, let alone any value. I really don't know why it is so loved by people at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Based on my personal experience, I firmly believe that while success depends on various factors such as the times, environment, and opportunity, human effort is the basic condition among these. If one does not know or does not try to make an effort, even if one is in a good era, in a good environment, and encounters a good opportunity, one will not know how to take advantage of it and let the favorable opportunity pass by in vain. Conversely, if one knows and is willing to make an effort, one can not only make use of existing favorable opportunities, but also create and transform them. The so-called "heroes create the times" and "human determination can overcome nature" are based on this principle. In my experience, there are three processes that can prove this principle.</p>
<p>The first is the organization of the Communist Party. We will not discuss the rights and wrongs of the Communist Party now. However, it has become a force in Chinese politics and society, which cannot be ignored. When Chen Zhongfu, Wu Tingci, and I discussed launching the organization of the Communist Party in Shanghai in 1920, there were fewer than thirty participants nationwide, and they were all unarmed scholars. At that time, they were just relying on their youthful courage to act blindly. Who knew that in less than five years, they would succeed in creating a great force. Although, due to errors in the subsequent leadership policy, they caused many destructive actions in China, no one can deny that it is a force and a very difficult problem for China to solve in the future. And its origin was the reckless actions of twenty-odd doctors.</p>
<p>The second is the Northern Expedition. I have described the internal and external environment of the revolutionary movement in 1924 and 1925 in this book. At that time, the revolutionary foundation was precarious, and it was already very difficult to maintain Guangzhou as a revolutionary base. No one even thought about launching a Northern Expedition, let alone succeeding in it. However, after the first and second Eastern Expeditions and the elimination of Yang and Liu, the Northern Expedition was actually launched. In less than three years after the start of the Northern Expedition, the entire country was unified under the power of the Chinese Kuomintang. At that time, the strength of the warlords was dozens of times greater than that of the revolutionary forces. They had excellent military equipment, abundant material resources, and a large number of troops. But they did not have the spirit of hard work and recklessness, so they could not use these powerful forces even though they possessed them. Although the material conditions of the revolutionary army were far inferior to those of the warlords, they had a spirit of perseverance, courage, and recklessness. This spirit could more than make up for the lack of material resources. Therefore, they were able to defeat the many with the few and overcome the strong with the weak. The speed with which the Northern Expedition was completed exceeded expectations at that time.</p>
<p>The third is the peace movement. I am ashamed to say that comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved, and national unification still requires effort. Therefore, we cannot think that the peace movement has achieved final success, but neither can we say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all. To discuss whether the peace movement has achieved anything, we must first look at the internal and external environment of China at the time the peace movement occurred. The peace movement occurred in the second half of 1938. At that time, Guangzhou and Wuhan fell one after another, and Britain and the United States stood by and watched, only offering moral sympathy and spiritual assistance for comfort. The situation of a complete national collapse was imminent. Under such circumstances, both the government and the people hoped to restore the situation before the Lugouqiao Incident, but both the government and the people felt that this hope could not be realized. Under normal circumstances, who could have dreamed that the national government could return to the capital and the Blue Sky White Sun flag could fly again under Zijin Mountain! Who could have dreamed that extraterritoriality could be abolished and concessions could be recovered! Who could have dreamed that Japan could be brought to make peace, immediately withdraw all its troops, and even abandon the right to station troops in North China as stipulated in the Boxer Protocol! Under normal circumstances, we have done everything that was considered impossible! This is even more progress than restoring the situation before the Lugouqiao Incident! If we retreat to the position of 1938 and after, and observe the current situation, can we say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all? As for the subsequent changes in the international situation, no one is a god, who can predict them! Therefore, we can say that the peace movement has not achieved complete success, but to say that the peace movement has achieved nothing at all is a heartless remark that distorts the truth. But the peace movement, which was able to achieve this little bit of success, had fewer than ten people when it was launched. The fact that fewer than ten people, without any support, were able to achieve the current situation shows that things are done by people.</p>
<p>Based on the three stages of my personal experience mentioned above, it can be seen that although the success or failure of a cause also depends on the favorable or unfavorable times and the good or bad environment, human effort is the basic factor. Looking back on the past and looking forward to the future, the future environment may be even worse and more dangerous. But as long as we hold on to the determination to "build strong fortresses and fight to the death," and at the same time use measures that are appropriate to the times, I believe that we are invincible and that there is no danger that we cannot overcome.</p>
<p>When I am idle, I often read through my own experiences. Although this half-life has experienced many twists and turns and encountered many storms, I am already proud of what I have achieved. I often return to the position of a poor student and think about the circumstances in which I am now. Personally, I am content. Because I have been able to participate in the work of several great movements in the past, and I am now able to shoulder part of the responsibility for the country in such a difficult situation, this is definitely not what I expected at the beginning. As far as I am concerned, up to now, I can say that I have achieved considerable success. Therefore, in the future, I will not only disregard gains and losses, but also not care about life and death! Life is like grass, living for one autumn. I ask myself, I have not failed this life.</p>
<p>However, people's thoughts change with the environment. In any position, one naturally develops a sense of responsibility appropriate to that position. I am not writing nice-sounding official articles to deceive the world, because I am no longer a poor student. I am now a key member of the peace movement and a person in charge of part of the country's tasks. Therefore, I feel that I still have unfulfilled responsibilities and unfinished undertakings for the country, for the nation, and even for East Asia. Whether the future environment will allow me to fulfill this responsibility and complete this undertaking, and whether I myself have such ability, are all different questions. But no matter how big a wave of upheaval comes, whether it succeeds or fails, I will use my small body to bear it, and I will never take cowardly action to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>Readers in friendly Japan can certainly gain a considerable understanding of my past hard work and struggle by reading this small book. But I hope that readers in friendly Japan will also understand that there are tens of thousands of young people in China today who are working hard and struggling just like me. These young people will be the pillars of China and the cornerstones of East Asia in the future. I hope that the young people of Japan and these young people of China will understand each other, support each other, and truly build a new East Asia.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the Continental News for translating and publishing this small book. (Reprinted from Gu Jin Bi-Monthly, Issue 40)</p>

If the retail oil store does not sell edible oil in accordance with this notice, citizens should immediately report the facts to the nearest police branch or office No. 703 of this government for investigation. Citizens living in former District 8 and the western part of Shanghai, which have recently been incorporated into this district, can also purchase edible oil in accordance with the above allocation method.</p>
<p>Industrial Needs Must Be Verified</p>
<p>Regarding the oil needed for business purposes in various industries, in order to prevent the supply of rationed oil to the black market, the edible oil allocation office has adopted a form-based application and approval system. The industry associations will determine the consumption of edible oil required by each industry, and request the allocation office to allocate according to the applied quantity. If the allocation office believes that the reported quantity exceeds the normal demand, it will be reduced during the review. It is also learned that the recent allocation of oil by the edible oil allocation office is because 20,000 piculs of oil have been shipped from Dalian.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e42">The Question Lies in Whether It Is Thorough <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>All aspects of a controlled economy, such as increasing production, conserving consumption, implementing rationing, and managing finance, are essential elements in constructing a new wartime economic system. They are also what those responsible for implementing the controlled economy are willing to follow. The question lies in whether it is done thoroughly. If it is not done thoroughly, any aspect of the controlled economy is merely a gilded advertising signboard!</p>
<p>The operation of a controlled economy relies first on the cooperation of officials and the people in economic control. Secondly, it requires both parties to clearly recognize the true spirit of a controlled economy, which lies in: 1. Existing legal basis, 2. Public interest priority principle, 3. Production focus doctrine. Therefore, all behaviors that violate government laws, seek personal gain, and waste spiritual and material resources should not exist.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about the big picture or the distant future; let's just talk about the two or three things in front of us. Stock listings clearly require approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange Supervisory Committee according to law. Why are there stock listings without approval, leading to the stranding of twenty-seven new stocks? Smoking, gambling, and dancing are the greatest demons that waste spiritual and material resources. Why are the venues for smoking, gambling, and dancing still open all night, with more people than carp? Taking the banning of dance halls as an example, it needs to be divided into three stages. May I ask, can "shortening and reducing dance hall operating hours" (first stage) prevent it from affecting the lives of thousands of dancers? Can "merging dance halls" (second stage) reduce the interest in dancing? Does "completely prohibiting them at a suitable time" (third stage) finally have a time that is sufficient for people to consider suitable? All of these questions may not be too big, but they are precisely about being thorough versus not being thorough.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Temporary Measures for Unified Management of Oil and Grain Announced; Commerce and Trade Commission Instructs Oil Special Committee, etc., to Comply <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>

<p>North China Su-Huai Trade Association Handles Member Registration</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the smooth circulation of goods between Central and North China, the authorities concerned are taking further steps to promote the exchange of goods between the two regions. The authorities are now aware that there are very few organizations for import and export traders in North China. Not only is there a lack of contact between merchants, but it is also difficult for the authorities to manage them. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Economy has designated the organization of the North China Import and Export Trade Association. In addition, the importance of the Su-Huai region has increased since the National Government ordered its change to Huaihai Province. Therefore, another Su-Huai Import and Export Trade Association is organized. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>For the North China Import and Export Trade Association, the Bureau of Economy has designated Wang Duo, Zhao Xiaoxian, Jin Zhigong, Huang Hongxiang, Chen Bingfang, Yu Liangyi, Sun Kangrong and other seven people as organizers, with Wang Duo as the director of preparation. The preparatory meeting will be held at 42-44 Xinchang Road. All import and export traders in North China must come to the meeting before the 7th of this month to register.</p>
<p>For the Su-Huai Import and Export Trade Association, the Bureau of Economy has appointed Zhao Jixin, Chen Zhusheng, Jin Zhigong, Sun Degong, and Zhu Zhenchang as organizers, with Zhao Jixin as the director of preparation. The preparatory office is located at 42-44 Xinchang Road. All tradesmen should register with the association before the 7th of this month in order to convene an inaugural meeting as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Selling Pressure Subsided, Foundation Firm, Shanghai Stock Market Gradually Improves <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of the 28 new stocks that debuted after the Spring Festival holiday in the Shanghai stock market was temporarily suspended, so the old and new investment targets shifted back to the old stocks, and the gathering of strength increased. The selling pressure in the market subsided, and the prices of various stocks rose slowly. The surge was particularly strong at the moment of the noon closing. People's hearts in all parties were firm. The Wing On and Sincere department stores in the department store industry rose by more than ten points. The rise of national goods was slower. In the textile industry, Meyer Silk Factory jumped to 200 yuan, a huge increase of 14 yuan. Rong Feng, Ren Feng, Yuan Yuan, Silk Industry, and Wing On Textile Factory each rose by 7 or 8 yuan. Jiang Lun was the only one that remained flat. Zhongfang and Xinyi both made progress. The new pharmaceutical industry rose across the board. Zhongfa and Xinya saw a rapid increase at noon closing. In the cultural sector, Jinfeng Paper stood out, breaking through the 20 yuan mark, rising more than 4 yuan. A certain bank made an advance, and China Film and China Bookstore rose steadily. In the chemical sector, Great China Matches and other stocks were firm and steady. Real estate stocks also saw an upward trend, and Yongxing and Linhua continued to rise. Others, such as Kang Yuan Canned Food, also stood out from the buying wave and broke through the 100 yuan mark, rising 10 yuan. Jiu An, Xin Zhong and other industrial enterprises, and Xin Ya Construction, are all progressing upward. The closing prices at noon are listed below:</p>

<p>Summary of Business Conditions</p>
<p>Government Bonds Continue to Rise: Yesterday, the unified bond market continued to advance, and the sentiment seemed more excited. However, only Type C was uniquely superior, and the gains and losses of other types were very limited. Even the rise of Type C failed to break through the second level and third grade several times, which was a pity. Type C opened at 22.24, one grade higher than the previous day, and then hovered between 2 and 3 grades. It rose three times to the edge of the 3rd grade, but eventually fell back. The minimum was half of the 2nd grade, and the final price at noon was 22.24, one grade better than the previous day. Type A was 17.2, Type B was 16.5, Type D was 16.3, and Type E was 16.7, all showing a firm trend. The turnover was more than 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rates Remain Stable: Yesterday morning, the interbank lending rates of the Money Trade Association remained stable at two cents and did not change.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rise: Yesterday, the domestic rice market opened strong, and the market recovered. However, prices fell slightly after the high. Thin rice rose by three grades, and both northern japonica and foreign pointed rice were traded. It was found that more traders entered the market, and the market atmosphere was softer in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Wool Spring Goods are Popular: Spring thin goods such as serge have been in great demand recently. The prices of Japan-China factories have increased sharply by two or three cents, and production has been sharply reduced. Large and small firms in the industry lack goods in hand. High-quality fine wool goods are scarce and prices are rising in the market. Light-colored artificial cotton serge and wool Hailisi and Home fabrics, and other men's and women's spring overcoat materials are also in short supply and are tending to rise in price.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Hongyang</p>
<p>Student No. 4 (1)</p>
<p>Tianwenkan Street is like Ginza in Tokyo and Dotonbori in Osaka. There are streetlights and movie theaters on both sides of the street. Coffee shops. Large stores such as bookstores. Although they are students from Kagoshima, they are not made of wood or stone, and they often come to this street.</p>
<p>"Although it's a little early for noon, let's go to Yamagataya to eat Western food?" Longfu persuaded Zhenren in this way.</p>
<p>"I don't like to eat anything." Zhenren resolutely refused. Although students from the Seventh High School often go in and out of the Western restaurant in Yamagataya Department Store, Zhenren did not think it was a place for middle school students to go.</p>
<p>"But - I'm already hungry."</p>
<p>"Then what's good to eat?"</p>
<p>"Let's buy Three Heroes steamed buns," Zhenren suggested. At that time, there were vendors selling this kind of steamed buns on the side of the street. Longfu bought a big bag full. "It seems like the radio is stopped today," said the old shopkeeper of the steamed bun shop.</p>
<p>The two of them walked towards Tianbaoshan without any hesitation. Because they were embarrassed to eat in front of people, they wanted to go to the hottest beach. Sitting on the sand under the pine trees, the two ate a full belly of steamed buns. This was indeed a strange celebration.</p>
<p>"I can see Mt. Osumi very clearly - to treat my nearsightedness, I even got some distant views." Longfu's best drawing, so he had oil painting equipment at home.</p>
<p>The two of them didn't go home until evening. In Zhenren's home, his mother and sister were also talking about the radio being broken. The silent radio suddenly spoke at around 8 o'clock in the evening. "8:15 PM on February 26th, Ministry of the Army released - at around 5 AM today, some young officers..."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>For this shocking event that shocked the country, Zhenren had reached the age of thinking about "why". But no matter how hard he thought, he couldn't fully understand. This is no wonder, even the top critics in Tokyo have only recently understood it with great difficulty, so middle school students in the remote Southern Province of Longma would not understand it. But, thinking about it carefully, why has this been happening continuously recently. The fact that Japan withdrew from the Second London Conference on the 16th of last month is also an example. This "why" seems to be half understood, so Zhenren became more and more anxious, and at the same time, this question is related to his aspiration to become a naval officer, so he was even more worried.</p>
<p>"Teacher, is this related to withdrawing from the League of Nations?" He asked when visiting Mr. Ogata's house on Sunday. "Hey..." Mr. Ogata, who didn't like students to be concerned about political issues, showed an ugly face. Suddenly, he thought that Zhenren was a qualified naval officer, and his mood changed again. "I don't understand very well either, the matter is indeed very important. A preparatory meeting was held three years ago, and Lieutenant General Yamamoto Isoroku advocated against the continuation of the Washington Treaty as the plenipotentiary representative. That was the second year of withdrawing from the League of Nations, and dark clouds had already been looming at that time..."</p>
<p>"Oh." Zhenren heard the name of Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku for the first time at this time.</p>
<p>"Like this kind of thing, I'm a layman. The principal is a historian and pays close attention to it. Everything is learned from the principal's rumors..."</p>
<p>The 5:5:3 ratio of the Washington Treaty is the origin of this knot. The effort to alleviate this pain was Japan's attitude at the First London Conference. Auxiliary ships are more than 70% of the US, submarines maintain the existing number of autonomy, and large cruisers are more than 60% of the US! This is Japan's claim. But in the end, it was established with the Washington Treaty as the basis, with a few meaningless conditions attached. First, this treaty was temporarily agreed upon and will expire this year (Showa 11), so Japan also painfully agreed.</p>
<p>However, once the deadline is up, the problem becomes serious. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States came together to hold this Second London Conference. At this time, Japan's attitude was different from before. Liquidating the past disarmament conferences, stipulating the maximum amount of holdings for each country, and establishing a situation in which countries do not threaten or invade each other - this attitude is no longer following others. It is no longer the humble words of asking for a few percent. This is an active statement. There is a big change here.</p>
<p>Of course, the United Kingdom and the United States opposed this claim, so Japan resolutely withdrew from the conference. For example, if a person is not very confident, he will never take this attitude.</p>
<p>"So the future is the era of no treaties - Gu Jun, you are about to become a naval soldier in the era of no treaties!"</p>
<p>Zhenren completely understood this why.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Baojia Chiefs Also Have Their Own Hardships <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fen</p>
<p>After reading the article "Rectify Baojia and the Police System" by Mr. Donglai in the National Forum of Shen Bao on February 4th, I have to say a few words. I am a Lianbao clerk in the Lujiawan Baojia District, so I am more aware of the situation of the Baojia.</p>
<p>Mr. Donglai's article first criticizes the Baojia chiefs for bullying people and not following the government's intentions to handle matters according to the situation, giving the people considerable convenience in duty time. However, it is important to know that the Lianbao Office does not know when assigning duty time whether someone is free at a certain time or someone has official duties at a certain time. Moreover, those who serve in hotels or apartments are divided into day and night shifts, and are free in the morning in this week and in the afternoon in the next week, so when assigning posts, they can only be arranged in order according to the order of the Baojia households, and it is inevitable that they will conflict with the residents' working hours. If the residents declare it in advance, they will always comply. If they receive the notice and do not immediately declare it, delaying the time, so that they cannot transfer other people to serve, of course, they will not be allowed.</p>
<p>For example, in this Lianbao, duty notices are always issued about ten days in advance. If residents have any objections to the duty time, they can raise them five days in advance, and there is still time to transfer them. However, if you wait until the day before the duty to request a change of time, then I'm sorry, it cannot be allowed.</p>
<p>As for what Mr. Donglai said that they cannot negotiate, the purpose is to take the opportunity to blackmail and force them to pay for someone to take their place, which is not entirely true. In the Lujiawan military, if the police hire someone to take their place, in addition to a fine, they will be prohibited from freedom for four hours. In addition to the Baojia chiefs, there are also police patrol teams, so there are several cases found every day; if the Baojia chiefs force residents to pay for someone to take their place, who will be responsible once they are found out? Therefore, it is said that the Baojia chiefs cannot accommodate changes in duty time, and there are really unavoidable hardships.</p>
<p>According to government regulations, the offspring of civil servants, doctors, and teachers can be exempted from the service of the self-defense group. In the Lianbao, there are many residents, and there are both good and bad, so it is inevitable that there are those who impersonate and try to avoid service. In a Lianbao adjacent to this Lianbao, there is a person who relies on his wife to work as a dancer. When he received the duty notice, he claimed to be a teacher in a certain school. After investigation by the police chief, it was found that he was lying, so anyone who submits formal certification documents will always be allowed. If they just talk empty words and cannot submit a certificate, they will not be exempted from service.</p>
<p>To be honest, in my Lianbao, there are as many as 2,500 members, and there are only three police station posts, and it takes almost three months to take three hours of service. And the Bao chiefs have to be on duty once every nine days, and the Jia chiefs have to be on duty once every eighteen days. They are all miserable and say that they would rather not be Baojia chiefs but be self-defense group members. Therefore, I say that it is best for everyone to discuss openly and honestly and obtain a reasonable solution to the distribution of duty time, so that you will not resent me and I will not hate you.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be stated that there are corrupt elements. For corrupt elements who despise the law, it is deeply hoped that the authorities will force them to be banned. For the general Baojia chiefs, it is best not to treat them all the same, as if they were enemies.</p>
