<p>社評</p>
<h3>祈戰死</h3>
<p>戰鬥精聯是國家存在於現代世界的基礎，捨棄自己的性命，爲國家，爲民族，謀永久的生存，是最高尙的道德·這種精神在盟邦日本表現得最顯著，所謂武士道，所謂大和魂，就是戰鬥的觀念。</p>
<p>「祈戰死」三字，是一九〇四年日俄戰爭時日本應徵的兵士，開始出發前方，親友們歡送旗上的標語。這個標語鼓勵國民爲國犧牲的勇氣。個人有犧牲的勇氣，然後國家方才不致於犧牲，方才能够永久存在，同時國家能過永久存在，個人也方才能夠永久存在，國家和國民的關係是一而二，二而一。自私自利的國民決計造不出一個强盛的國家，沒有犧牲男氣的國民，只有促成國家的犧牲。等到國家已經犧牲，國民的一切也就完了。等到你再想翻身，可是時間已經是來不及了。祈戰死的精神表示日本國民全體都決意為國犧牲，這個決意，先食定精神上必勝的基礎，他的力量可以克服一切物質上的困難，可以發揮戰塲上以一當百效果。所以日俄戰爭中日本的勝利，不必等待日本兵士的到趙戰地，就在出發的時候，早已決定了的。</p>
<p>這次大東亞戰爭裏，最能够發揮戰鬥精神的，就是盟邦日本。去年山本元帥的殉國，和本年古賀元帥的盡忠，都表示日本將帥身先士卒，視死如歸的精神。艦隊總司令原可以不必身臨前敵，而日本的司令長官，依照東鄉元帥的傳統精神，始終站立船橋前綫而不願躱避於司令塔內。元帥是全艦隊的重心，元帥的勇氣如此，那末，全艦隊人士的勇氣百倍，更是不言而喻。所以當東鄕元帥發出「生死存亡，在此一戰」的口號時，全艦隊人士，氣吞山河，戰事騰利早已決定的了。</p>
<p>這種悲壯精神，也是我們中國往古以來昨最崇拜的。所謂「見危授命」，所謂「公爾王私，國爾忘家」，就是往古以來一般人所要鼓勵大家的。這種精神使中國維繁數千年到現在，是連粹的東方精神。可是從鴉片戰爭以後，國人受央美思想的毒害極深，利人的思想敵不過利己的思想，愛國的思想敵不過愛已的思想。自私自利的人一天天的增加，愛幫愛國的人一天天減少。國家的權益因此一天天的被人侵略，國家的地位一天天的降落·這次大東亞戰爭，是中國解放千載難得的好機會。我們應該以盟邦日本將士爲模範，每個人必須各自站在崗位上努力，發揮戰鬥精神‘尤其是在朝官吏，對於當前足以妨碍參戰的問題，有勇氣排除之，應與前綫將士伺樣發揮戰鬥精神。</p>
<h3>日印軍進攻下　印度國內情勢分析</h3>
<p>英國對印政策的根本理念是「分割統治」。這和英國對歐洲大陸之傳統的外交方針十均勢政策是一挨的。英權均勢政策的根本，是歐洲諸勢力的羣雄割據性，同樣，對印度的分割統治政策，也坊妙地利用印度臨內情勢的分裂性。甘地會慨　道：「印度國內印度人之自相對立，在完成印度人的印度上，是最大的障碍。」甘地歷來所從事的諸運動，大多數與其說是反英抗爭運動，倒不如說是各敎徒問的協調運動，印度敎民社會中不可接觸賤民階級之水平運動，成是打破他們中問階級的運動。</p>
<p>印度擁有面積十五萬五千平方英哩的盧大國土，人口四萬萬，言語二百種以上，社會上有各種宗敎的對立，複雜的階級制度，所以各種問題非常錯綜複雜，以至各方面產生分製狀態，蓋是豐所必然的。</p>
<p>政治團體對立</p>
<p>這種分裂和對立，其最顯著的是政治團體問的對立，及士侯國與英屬印度的關係。印度獨立的所以遲遲不進，如其說其責任在於印度人本身，那就因爲有這二個問題的緣故。茲試略述現在印度的三個有力政治團體，及其對印度獨立問題的主張。</p>
<p>印度國民會議派擁有黨員四百五十萬，是印度第一個政黨。該黨對獨立的運動標識是印度的十完全獨立。對此次大戰勃發時，總督所宣言的允錯戰後的自治領制之提案，明白表示反對。克立甫析的讓步案，亦表反對，而決議英國勢力應立即退出印度，並對總會表示强硬態度，苟在二星期內不獲答覆，立即開始大規模的不服從運動。</p>
<p>全印回敎徒聯盟黨員四十萬，以印度八千萬回敎徒爲其背景，該堂編領，在印度的獨立這點上，與會議派立在同一立塲，但會議派所主張少民族主義，以印度合體利益爲主旨，而該黨則主張種族主義，以擁護印度回敎徒的本身利益爲其最大目標。所以對印度的獨立問題，不贊成印度的單獨獨立，而主張印度敎徒與回敎徒的印度分割獨立論。此次大戰勃發時，回敎徒縱明白英國的政策，但也不從事反英運動，大體頗順從英國方面的希望。</p>
<p>興茲·馬哈隆巴黨回敎徒聯盟以擁熟回敎徒利益爲第一義，該黨則標榜擁襪印度敎徒的利益，採種族主義，在這一點上與國民會議派立塲不同，該黨目標在獲得印度敎徒所主持的印度完全獨立，其主張英國如速即承認印度國民政府的樹立，允許完全的自治，即吿滿足。對英妥協的色彩頗多。</p>
<p>這樣·在希望獨立的這一點上，雖有一致的目標，但在獨立性與自由性的程度上，並在其完威方法上，各黨派間意見不全一致，英國的的分割統治政策，巧妙地覷準了這點</p>
<p>英國的走狗——土候國</p>
<p>除這政治團體的對立之外，印度諸土侯國的能度，亦妨礙印度的獨立運動。土侯國要求英國承認其封建的君主制，並保證其成權與地位，而其代價則對英國效忠。他們完全做了英國的懷柔牽制政策之俘虜，今　醉心於封建的榮軍，繼續苛可斂求土民，而甘爲英國的忠僕。且對獨立運動，不管其內容如何，以其成脅自己的權勢與地位，始終反對，而願作英國的走狗。此次大戰勃發時，雖目覩世界情勢的大慶動。仍取漠不關心的態度·其故即在於此。這種土侯國大小共右六百餘，領域約占印度全面積的四成，人斗約爲三成，所以在印度獨立運動上，地位相當重要。</p>
<p>對印度的獨立，英國始終一貫的聲辯，祇要印度內政上的糾紛能够解決，就給與自治。不然，獨立之後反要造成內亂。英國知道士侯國的對英效忠不會變更，各政治團體的對立不會解消，一面在政策上並在背後煽動，加被其對立。</p>
<p>對立的消除</p>
<p>然而上述對立關係和不一致行動，以此次歐洲大戰與大東亞戰爭爲契機，而逐漸解消了。印度回敎徒對於英國對巴勒斯坦回敎徒及阿拉伯民族所採措置，頗表忿懣，一部份靑年回敎徒頗部　於聯盟首腦部的對英協調的態度，而表示反對。又最近在德國注視世界情勢之轉移的富舍大主敎，曾對印度回敎徒聲明：「協力日印軍，參加解放印度之戰。」故印度回敎徒聯盟今後的動向，將有劃時期的雙變。一面，以日印軍的進攻印度作戰爲契機，苦於土侯國緊榨下的人民，巳奮袂頗起了。光前在拉奇普泰那，加希米爾的襲擊警察事件，脫拉凡果爾，瑪伊案爾的軍需工廠，紡織工廠罷工事件，抵制英貨等拼英示威運動，已活潑能展開着。</p>
<p>這樣，正如對歐洲大陸的均勢政策之失效一樣，英國對印度的分割統治政策，今也岌岌可危了。（翔：譯自四月二十二日東京每日新聞）</p>
<h3>緬甸日空軍活躍　猛襲敵方連輸線　英第四軍被包圍處境危殆</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　印度某基地七日電：緬甸方面航空戰積扼展，開後，敵方空中國重隊即不斷作積極之運輸活動，駐渝美空軍除藉渝方空輸路獲取補給外，隣接飛行隊運輸機班等只與北部緬甸之敵空輸部隊同樣運日動員運輸機數十架，不斷從事運輸補組工作。因日軍辦伊姆法爾方面進攻態勢現已完成，故敵人即決心死守伊姆法爾，乃派遺運輸機陶格拉斯DC型機運輸戰時物資及人員等，以謀增强人員及各種補組，但經日軍邀舉後，當繫落繫毀其五十架，其中空軍人員之喪失更屬不少此實予空軍人員缺之之敵方以極大影響。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　緬甸基地七日電：緬甸方面日陸軍航空部隊精銳，曾於五日晨以戰鬥轟炸機連合大編隊，飛臨某地敵陣地上空，連續投彈，轟炸敵砲兵陣地加以重創，使敵砲陣完全沉默。日機繼連續襲擊迪馬布爾公路上疾走中之敵運貨卡車隊，俯衝炸中敵卡車二三十輛，獲得極大戰果。又日襪一隊猛襲敵機塲，瞬即擊毀陸上滑翔機四架，更超低空射擊機塲四周之敵陣地及多數兵員使大受損失，日機全部返防</p>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　伊姆法爾盆地南方英第四軍，因最後抵抗綫巴列爾及某地已處於危境，故派員至西闌請求救援，然英國因印度國內情勢紊亂，須出兵彈壓，且須顧及其他部隊之空輸應援工作，故雖已勉強允第四軍之要求，然彼等仍部無狼狽之感。因最近伊姆法爾盆地之印兵一方面受日軍包圍壓縮之影饗，一方面目睹印國民軍爲祖國獨立而獻身疆塲之熱情，故戰意殆已全部喪失，致參加印國民軍者日衆，因此使英第四軍之統帥部極感狼狽，故特將此等印兵以飛機輸至加爾各答方面，而將該處之非洲兵調遣至伊姆法爾盆地及哥希馬前綫。</p>

<h3>論申報社科學獎金治創立</h3>
<p>— 張詩洲</p>
<p>本月一日，申報宣佈創立科學獎金，並公佈科學獎金委員會之委員人選及組織章程，以獎勵國民對於自然科學的研究及發明爲其宗旨，是一個可喜也極可感動的消息。這無疑地是申報有史六十餘年以來偉大的創舉，聞風而響應的也立即有同業新聞報，以及社會名流多人。在此時此地，其意義之遠大，我想除了助學金以外沒有更可和牠匹敵了。</p>
<p>類同申報這種科學獎金的組織在瑞典有諾貝爾獎金委員會，在美國育洛克斐勒基金委員會，其他各先進國也大都設有類似的獎金，基金組織，均不外乎以獎勵有功文化的功臣，間接得以推進國民科學研究熟忱，爲工作目標。做申報這種舉措在中國大陸上或許還是創舉，其是否能收得推進科學的實效，還在我們知識階級的如何熱烈贊助，當然原動力是必要的。至於先決問題，當然是先從事雄厚基尚有些漢不動中，未加普遍注目，原因便是因為各行動可以獲得眞實的信賴，申報今日雖然保管的基金還不很多，各委員幹事也因各有職業自然不能專顧，但是僅可以先抽出一些功夫來，先做些成積給社會大眾看看。祗要獲得信賴，捐款自能源源而來，大事豈不立妥，科學獎金的辦理是需要積極的，如立刻抽出相當的資金先補助一部份清寒而研究科學確有偉大成就實據者，然後千萬捐款，怕不耍接踵而來，科學研究的風尙就可瀰漫全中國。其盛况和絡績收得的實效要比助學金，貸學金大上一千倍自在意料之中，是不生問題的。</p>
<p>中國多的無名科學家，祗因限於經濟，不能有所作為，像各地大，中學的敎授，敎員很多這種情形的，如此一來至少中國的科學人員略可的其所了，科學救國便可提代消極救國作為國策，國家幸甚，但望委員會諸公能採納　見，立刻實施，則遠大的計劃將來可以不負當年籌劃的一番苦心了。</p>

<h3>當局穩定商市　調查各業買賣　上周物價趨勢仍安靜</h3>
<p>太市物資統制機關，爲嚴禁各商店非法漲價起見，連日對於調查工作，進行殊不遺餘力。一般調查人員大都熟諳各業商情，故澈查進行，尙感方便。其調查對象，一爲調閱商店賬簿，查驗其進貨簿與銷貨簿等，藉明其售出貨物價格有否遞增，及不合法律上規定各點。二則調查商店有無囤積居奇不售情事，餘如銷貨是否出給發票，物品陳列是否標籤著明價格，亦均在調查之例。倘經發覺，有不合情事之一者，即按照現定辦法嚴厲懲處。</p>
<p>昨日各業方面探悉關於上周物價趨勢，仍安靜如恒，但各該囤戶函求將久囤貨物貶價出籠，卒因問津者乏人，以致各項交易殊甚淸閒，惟一般投機商人爲謀挽回頹勢，企圖組設「貿易公司」，美其名日「代客買賣」，實質係屬掮客性質，將某形加重買方成本，亦即做高市價。因此，關係當局對於此等類似買空賣空交易巳寄予密切注意，決將從嚴取締，以期長時間穩定物價。至於各種物品限價負責當局甫在調查其經售成本，果屬成本加重者。將設法酌量遞增，以維商艱云。</p>

<h3>Praying for Death in Battle</h3>
<p>The spirit of fighting and unity is the foundation for a nation's existence in the modern world. To give up one's life for the country and the nation, to seek lasting survival, is the highest morality. This spirit is most evident in our allied nation, Japan. So-called Bushido, so-called the Yamato spirit, are concepts of battle.</p>
<p>The three characters "Praying for Death in Battle" were a slogan on the flags of well-wishing relatives farewelling Japanese conscripted soldiers departing for the front line during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. This slogan encouraged the people's courage to sacrifice for their country. Only when individuals have the courage to sacrifice can the country avoid being sacrificed and exist perpetually. At the same time, only when the country can exist perpetually can individuals exist perpetually. The relationship between the country and the people is both one and two, and two and one. Selfish and self-serving people can never create a strong country. A nation without a spirit of sacrifice will only hasten its own demise. Once the country has been sacrificed, everything for the people is over. By the time you want to turn things around, it's too late. The spirit of praying for death in battle shows that the entire Japanese nation is determined to sacrifice for the country. This determination lays a foundation for spiritual victory, and its power can overcome all material difficulties, creating an effect of one against a hundred on the battlefield. Therefore, Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War was decided not when Japanese soldiers arrived on the battlefield, but at the moment they set off.</p>
<p>In this Greater East Asia War, it is our allied nation, Japan, that is best able to demonstrate the fighting spirit. Marshal Yamamoto's martyrdom last year and Marshal Koga's dedication to his country this year both demonstrate the spirit of Japanese generals leading by example and regarding death as homecoming. The fleet commander-in-chief does not necessarily have to be on the front line, but the Japanese commander, following the traditional spirit of Marshal Togo, always stood on the front line of the bridge rather than hiding in the command tower. The marshal is the center of gravity of the entire fleet, and if the marshal's courage is like this, then the courage of all personnel in the fleet is a hundredfold, which goes without saying. Therefore, when Marshal Togo issued the slogan "Our survival depends on this battle," all personnel in the fleet had a spirit that could swallow mountains and rivers, and victory in battle was already decided.</p>
<p>This kind of tragic spirit is also what we Chinese have admired since ancient times. The so-called "risking one's life in times of danger" and "being impartial in public affairs and selfless in private matters, forgetting one's family for the sake of the country" are what people have generally encouraged since ancient times. This spirit has enabled China to flourish for thousands of years until now, and it is the essence of the Eastern spirit. However, since the Opium War, the Chinese people have been deeply poisoned by Anglo-American thought. The idea of benefiting others cannot overcome the idea of benefiting oneself, and the idea of loving the country cannot overcome the idea of loving oneself. The number of selfish and self-serving people is increasing day by day, and the number of people who love their country is decreasing day by day. As a result, the country's rights and interests are being invaded day by day, and the country's status is declining day by day. This Greater East Asia War is a rare opportunity for China to liberate itself after a thousand years. We should take the Japanese soldiers of our allied nation as role models, and everyone must stand on their respective posts and work hard to demonstrate the fighting spirit. In particular, officials in the government should have the courage to eliminate problems that hinder participation in the war and demonstrate the same fighting spirit as the soldiers on the front line.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Domestic Situation in India Under the Japanese-Indian Army Offensive</h3>
<p>The fundamental concept of British policy towards India is "divide and rule." This is consistent with Britain's traditional diplomatic policy towards the European continent: the balance of power. The foundation of Britain's balance of power policy is the fragmented nature of European powers. Similarly, the divide-and-rule policy towards India subtly utilizes the divisive nature of the domestic situation in India. Gandhi once lamented: "The self-contradictory opposition of Indians within India is the biggest obstacle to the completion of India for Indians." Most of the movements that Gandhi has engaged in over the years are less anti-British resistance movements than coordination movements between religious adherents, horizontal movements of untouchable castes in Hindu society, or movements to break down the classes among them.</p>
<p>India has a vast territory of 1.55 million square miles, a population of 400 million, more than 200 languages, and various religious oppositions and complex class systems in society. Therefore, various problems are very complex, leading to a state of division in various aspects, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>Political Group Opposition</p>
<p>The most prominent of these divisions and oppositions are the opposition between political groups and the relationship between the princely states and British India. The reason why India's independence has been so delayed is due to these two problems, if the responsibility lies with the Indians themselves. Let us briefly describe the three powerful political groups in India today and their views on the issue of Indian independence.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress has 4.5 million members and is the first political party in India. The party's movement for independence is marked by India's complete independence. It clearly opposed the proposal for a dominion system after the war, which was declared by the Governor-General when the war broke out. It also opposed the Cripps Offer and resolved that British forces should immediately withdraw from India and expressed a tough attitude to the General Assembly, stating that if no reply was received within two weeks, it would immediately begin a large-scale disobedience movement.</p>
<p>The All-India Muslim League has 400,000 members and is backed by 80 million Muslims in India. The League's platform is on the same position as the Congress Party on the point of India's independence, but the Congress Party advocates a minority nationalism, taking the interests of the Indian union as its main objective, while the League advocates racialism, taking the protection of the interests of Indian Muslims as its primary goal. Therefore, on the issue of India's independence, it does not support India's independent independence, but advocates a separate independence theory for India's Hindus and Muslims. When the war broke out, the Muslims clearly understood British policy, but did not engage in anti-British movements and were generally quite compliant with British hopes.</p>
<p>The Hindu Mahasabha party is the first priority to support the interests of Muslims, while the party boasts of supporting the interests of Hindu Indians and adopts racialism. In this respect, it differs from the position of the National Congress. The party's goal is to obtain the complete independence of India under the auspices of Hindu Indians, and it is satisfied if Britain immediately recognizes the establishment of an Indian national government and allows complete autonomy. There is a lot of compromise with the British.</p>
<p>In this way, although there is a unified goal in hoping for independence, opinions are not entirely consistent among the various parties on the degree of independence and freedom and on its complete power method. The British policy of divide and rule cleverly aimed at this point.</p>
<p>British stooges - the princely states</p>
<p>In addition to the opposition of these political groups, the attitude of the Indian princely states also hinders India's independence movement. The princely states demand that Britain recognize their feudal monarchy and guarantee their established rights and status, in exchange for their loyalty to Britain. They are completely captured by Britain's policy of appeasement and containment, are now fascinated by feudal glory, continue to ruthlessly collect from the people, and are willing to be Britain's loyal servants. Moreover, regardless of the content of the independence movement, as it threatens their own power and status, they have always opposed it and are willing to be British stooges. When the war broke out, they still took an indifferent attitude despite witnessing the great changes in the world situation. The reason for this lies here. There are more than 600 of these large and small princely states, with an area accounting for about 40% of the total area of India and a population accounting for about 30%. Therefore, their position is quite important in the Indian independence movement.</p>
<p>On the issue of India's independence, Britain has always consistently argued that as long as the internal political disputes in India can be resolved, autonomy will be granted. Otherwise, independence will cause internal strife. Britain knows that the princely states' loyalty to Britain will not change, and the opposition between the various political groups will not be resolved. On the one hand, it incites and exacerbates their opposition in policy and behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Eliminating Opposition</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned opposition and inconsistent actions have gradually been resolved by the European War and the Greater East Asia War. Indian Muslims have expressed considerable resentment towards the measures taken by the United Kingdom against Palestinian Muslims and the Arab nation, and some young Muslims are quite dissatisfied with the pro-British coordination attitude of the League's leadership and have expressed their opposition. In addition, Bishop Foucher, who has recently been paying attention to the changes in the world situation in Germany, has declared to Indian Muslims: "Cooperate with the Japanese and Indian armies and participate in the war to liberate India." Therefore, the future direction of the Indian Muslim League will have a period-making double change. On the one hand, with the Japanese-Indian army's offensive operation into India as an opportunity, the people who have suffered under the tight squeeze of the princely states have already risen up. The police attack incidents in Rachiputana and Kashmir in the past, the strike incidents in the military supply factories and textile factories in Travancore and Mai An'er, and the anti-British demonstration movements such as boycotting British goods have been vigorously launched.</p>
<p>In this way, just as the balance of power policy towards the European continent has failed, Britain's divide-and-rule policy towards India is now in jeopardy. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on April 22)</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Active in Burma, Fiercely Attacking Enemy Transportation Lines, British Fourth Army Surrounded and in Perilous Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from an Indian base on the 7th: Since the escalation of the air war in Burma, enemy air transport corps have been continuously conducting active transport activities. In addition to obtaining supplies through the Chongqing air transport route, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing and adjacent flight teams use dozens of transport aircraft and other transport aircraft to continuously engage in transport and supply work, just like the enemy air transport units in northern Burma. Because the Japanese army's offensive posture in the Imphal area has now been completed, the enemy is determined to defend Imphal to the death, and dispatched Douglas DC transport aircraft to transport wartime materials and personnel to enhance personnel and various supplies, but after being intercepted by the Japanese army, 50 of them were shot down, and the loss of air force personnel was quite significant, which had a great impact on the enemy's lack of air force personnel.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from a Burmese base on the 7th: The elite Japanese army air force units in Burma flew over enemy positions in a combined large formation of fighter-bombers on the morning of the 5th, continuously dropping bombs and heavily bombarding enemy artillery positions, silencing the enemy artillery positions completely. The Japanese aircraft continued to attack enemy truck convoys speeding along the Dimapur highway, diving and bombing 20 to 30 enemy trucks, achieving great results. Another Japanese team fiercely attacked an enemy airfield, instantly destroying four land gliders, and even fired at enemy positions and a large number of soldiers around the airfield at ultra-low altitude, causing heavy losses. All Japanese aircraft returned to base.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) The British Fourth Army south of the Imphal basin is in a critical situation because the last line of resistance, Palel and somewhere else, is in danger, so it sent personnel to Ceylon to request assistance. However, because the domestic situation in India is chaotic, Britain must send troops to suppress it and must also take into account the air transport support work of other troops. Therefore, although it has reluctantly agreed to the Fourth Army's request, they still do not feel panicked. Recently, the Indian troops in the Imphal basin, on the one hand, are affected by the Japanese army's encirclement and compression, and on the other hand, they have witnessed the enthusiasm of the Indian National Army dedicating themselves to the country's independence, so their fighting spirit has almost completely disappeared, and the number of people joining the Indian National Army is increasing day by day. This has caused great embarrassment to the command of the British Fourth Army, so it has transported these Indian troops to the Calcutta area by plane and transferred African troops from that area to the Imphal basin and the Kohima front.</p>

<h3>Rumors Run Rampant in Turkish Capital</h3>
<p>Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) Reuter's reports: Rumors are running rampant in the Turkish capital, which is caused by Germany's failure to express its position on the suspension of the import of Turkish minerals. An air defense exercise was held in Istanbul the night before, making all parties feel more uneasy. In order to stabilize people's hearts, the semi-official agency "Ulus Newspaper" published an article officially denying rumors such as the bombing of Edirne and the discovery of a time bomb on the Taurus Express, and resolutely denied the saying that Germany issued an ultimatum. The newspaper also refuted the rumors that the Turkish government and the parliament disagree.

They will also mobilize submarines waiting in secret bases and small two-man submarines. Simultaneously, electrically-operated mortars deployed along the coast will be activated, firing from behind coastal cliffs. Furthermore, they will guard against Anglo-American paratrooper units in their rear. Therefore, the German defense forces are composed of mechanized elites.

<h3>35th Period of Cigarettes: Handling of Distribution</h3>
<p>The Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association recently issued a notice to all wholesale and retail merchants to handle the distribution of the 35th period of cigarettes, estimated at approximately 8,300 yuan for Grade D, with other grades increasing according to a 1-2-4-8 system. The distributed goods are entirely in accordance with the new price limit, granting the association a legal profit of 20 percent. The majority of the cigarettes distributed are from various Chinese tobacco factories and miscellaneous brands. Payments are due by a deadline, followed by a scheduled date for pickup. It is said that wholesale and retail merchants are dissatisfied with Huazhong's adjusted price limit, requesting improvements to maintain their business. Huazhong is currently considering this matter.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Brands of Cigarettes Will Also Have Fixed Prices</h3>
<p>Since the Huazhong Cigarette Allocation Association adjusted the prices of allocated cigarettes in the middle of last month, the black market for cigarettes has virtually disappeared, and it is no longer as difficult for citizens to purchase allocated cigarettes as it used to be. According to reliable information from the tobacco industry, the control of cigarettes will be further strengthened in the near future. It is planned to implement fixed prices for all miscellaneous brands of cigarettes produced by various cigarette manufacturers to prevent the illegal price increases of these brands, which would affect the sale of allocated cigarettes. It has also been noted that the variety of miscellaneous brands of cigarettes in the city has been increasing daily, with over thirty kinds currently selling well in the market.</p>
<h3>Spring Loan: Banking Syndicate Agrees to Lend 50 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to financial circles, after all the silk factories in Huazhong were returned by the Allied nations, the original owners have continued to operate them to seek future development. The spring cocoons will soon be available on the market, and it is said that the silk industry has approached banks to negotiate loans for purchasing spring cocoons. Banks have formed a syndicate to provide loans totaling 50 million yuan. The method will be through bill discounting, and the Silk Industry Association will need to provide certification. At the same time, the Central Reserve Bank has agreed to rediscount. This loan is expected to be established soon, and the silk factories have sent personnel to Wuxi, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places to arrange for the purchase of cocoons. It is expected that the cocoon harvest will begin in late this month. This year's spring silkworm breeding in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has been prosperous, and a bumper harvest is expected. The silk industry anticipates that the 50 million yuan loan may not be enough to purchase all the cocoons and is planning other methods to increase the amount of funds available for cocoon purchases.</p>

<p>National Forum</p>
<h3>On the Establishment of the Shen Bao Science Award Fund</h3>
<p>— Zhang Shizhou</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the Shen Bao announced the establishment of the Science Award Fund and made public the list of committee members and the organizational charter, with the aim of rewarding citizens for their research and inventions in natural sciences. This is joyful and deeply moving news. Undoubtedly, this is a great initiative in the Shen Bao's sixty-year history, and it has been immediately echoed by other newspapers and many social celebrities. In this time and place, the significance of this is profound. I think that besides student aid, nothing can compare with it.</p>
<p>Organizations similar to the Shen Bao's Science Award Fund include the Nobel Prize Committee in Sweden and the Rockefeller Foundation Committee in the United States. Most other developed countries also have similar award and foundation organizations, all of which aim to reward meritorious cultural figures and indirectly promote the enthusiasm of citizens for scientific research. The Shen Bao's actions may be a first on the Chinese mainland. Whether it can achieve the practical effect of promoting science depends on how enthusiastically our intellectual class supports it. Of course, the original driving force is necessary. As for the prerequisites, of course, it is first to engage in solid foundations. Because various actions can gain genuine trust, although the funds currently managed by the Shen Bao are not very large, and the committee members and staff cannot devote themselves fully due to their various occupations, they can first extract some time to do some work to show the public. As long as trust is gained, donations will naturally flow in, and great things will be readily accomplished. The management of science awards needs to be proactive, such as immediately extracting considerable funds to first subsidize some poor scholars who are engaged in scientific research and have real and great achievements. After that, I am afraid that millions of donations will follow one after another, and the fashion of scientific research can spread throughout China. The grand occasion and practical effects obtained will be a thousand times greater than student aid and loan funds. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>China has many unknown scientists who cannot achieve anything due to economic limitations. There are many such situations among professors and teachers in colleges and universities across the country. If this is the case, at least China's scientific personnel can get something they need. Science can be proposed to replace passive national salvation as a national policy. Fortunately, I hope that the members of the committee can adopt my suggestions and implement them immediately. Then the long-term plan can live up to the hard work of planning in those years.</p>

<h3>Authorities Stabilize the Market: Investigate Trading in Various Industries; Price Trends Last Week Remain Quiet</h3>
<p>The authorities in charge of controlling materials in Shanghai are sparing no effort in conducting daily investigations to strictly prohibit illegal price increases by various stores. The general investigators are familiar with the commercial situation of various industries, so the thorough investigation is more convenient. The objects of the investigation are: First, review the store's account books to verify the incoming and outgoing cargo books to determine whether the price of the sold goods has increased and the points that do not comply with legal regulations. The second is to investigate whether the store has hoarding and reluctant to sell. Others, such as whether the sales are given invoices, and whether the prices are clearly marked on the goods display labels, are also examples of the investigation. If any non-compliance is found, severe penalties will be imposed in accordance with current regulations.</p>
<p>According to information from various industries yesterday, the price trend last week remained as quiet as ever, but various hoarding households asked to reduce the price of long-hoarded goods, but because there were few people who inquired, various transactions were very idle. However, in order to recover the decline, general speculators attempted to set up a "trading company", beautifying its name as "buying and selling on behalf of customers", and its essence is that it is a broker nature, which will increase the cost of the buyer, that is, increase the market price. Therefore, the authorities concerned have paid close attention to these similar fictitious transactions and decided to strictly ban them in order to stabilize prices for a long time. As for the persons in charge of price limits for various items, they have just investigated their sales costs. If the cost is indeed increased, they will try to gradually increase them to maintain the difficulties of the merchants.</p>

<h3>Mayor's Cup Football Quarterfinals: Donghua Wins Over Yijing</h3>
<p>In the Mayor's Cup Football Quarterfinals, Donghua played against Yijing at 9:45 AM yesterday at the Shanghai Sports Association Stadium at Huangpi Road Racecourse. Donghua defeated Yijing by three to one and won the right to play in the final. At the beginning of the game, Donghua fought against the wind. Yijing kicked off in the middle line, and Yu Liming advanced on the side line. With one pass, Donghua Zhang Banglun caught a full embrace, and things passed. Yijing is still prosperous, and Mai Qidang did not hit the door with one shot each. Donghua committed an arbitrary ball twice, and Yijing failed to get what it wanted. In 20 minutes, Dai Linjing had a great scoring opportunity, but it was a little bit oblique. At 37 minutes, Jia Youliang intercepted a handball and passed it to Li Yao. Li had eyes on the top, approaching Yao Long, and Rossell was too late to stop it. Donghua led by 1 to 0 in the first half. In the sound of the second battle, both sides did not move. Zhang Lingen was anxious for a while and fouled by pushing people in the penalty area. He was sentenced to 12 yards, which was operated by Robert Stoff. Zhang Bang绾Fu Zhixinling turned the danger into safety. After a while, 戴经捲土重来, passing through Tie Funik, kicked the corner of the heavy pass, and Funik ignored the beginning and the end, and returned after hitting the mark. Soon, Sun Tieleg's second artillery-style attack hit the crossbar and escaped. In 23 minutes, Han Longhai crept into the hinterland and merged with Funik. Li Yao took the opportunity to shoot into the empty goal to make it 3-0. Yijing was unwilling to sting for a long time. Mai Qidang tried a small knife and recovered the lost ground. When Yijing desperately counterattacked, but the silver horn rang for a long time, the time ended, and Donghua finally defeated Yijing by 3 to 1. The military capacity of the two teams is recorded later:</p>
<p>Donghua: Zhang Banglun, Li Ning, Zhuang Youren, Liang Shutang, Tan Fuzhen, Zhang Lingen, Sun Jinshun, Zai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang.</p>
<p>Yijing: Funik, 維納, Rossell, Yu Lihua, Tie Funik, Mi Hailov, 洛夫, Mai Qidang, Robert Stoff, En Dibifu, Yu Liming.</p>
