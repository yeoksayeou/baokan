<p>社評</p>
<h3>大東亞戰爭的本質</h3>
<p>我們在準備迎接參戰一週年紀念之日，對於大東亞戰爭的木質，感覺有再加檢討的必要。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，實為亞洲十億被壓迫民族的解放戰。　昔印度，緬甸先為海盜英國所榨取，運用謀略，離間印度各州各階級各宗敎，使之同室操戈，度奴役生活，以致死於非命者年計數十萬人。繼之，英國荷蘭叉征服爪哇，蘇門答臘，婆羅洲等土著民族，取得世界最大資源，復以榨取得來的大量資源，侵略大東亞獨立國中國和日本。美國也以人道主義的假面具，而行帝國主義之實，橫斷太平洋，攫取菲律賓，使罪島固有的文化化為灰燼，更進而夥同英國在中國境內逞其野心。</p>
<p>在英美的侵略之下，我們受其荼毒，巳達百年之久，不獨四千年來東亞固有的文化岌岌可危，甚至大東亞各民族的生命也感威脅。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，就是大東亞民族襬脫英美的鐵蹄，求取生存的自衛之戰。我們不但耍將英美的勢力完全逐出東亞，並且根本打破人種不平等的英美殘餘思想。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，過去二年來，憑着日軍的奮勇作戰，業已奠定必勝態勢，並產生了新興的緬甸，菲律賓等獨立國。同時，由大東亞七國的代表議定大東亞建設五項綱領，即：　共存共榮；　獨立親和；　文化昂揚；　經濟繁榮；　貢獻世界進步等原則。以此五大綱領為建設大東亞的理想，並完遂大東亞戰爭的勝利，我們究應做些什麽呢？第一，加緊中日的提携，確立大東亞各國協力决戰的態勢。第二，總動員國家的各階層各部門，集中力量於增强生產，以期在長期戰中取得勝利。</p>
<p>總之，這次戰爭，是大東亞各民族各國家共同的戰爭。我們參戰已經一年了，可是，我們並未直接擔任前綫的任務，這在參加戰爭的義務，在共同建設大東亞的義務而言，我們絕對不能諉卸應有的任務。那末，前綫的作戰，旣經盟邦將士獨任艱鉅，而後方的給養，我們就義不容辭了。所以，如何完成後方兵站基地的工作，以源源不絕地供給前方將士，堅持長期作戰，這是我們全國上下所應共同努力的方向。簡單言之，政府從速完成戰時體制，實踐戰時經濟政策綱領，尤其是增加生產，安定物價。人民一方面依照政府指示竭力增加生產，一方而節約儲蓄，厚蓄財源。以為後方給養的準備。</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭，可說是亞洲民族自覺的戰爭，不過，就爭取必勝而言，有了自覺，依然不够，必須亞洲民族都有必勝的堅定信念；有了堅定信念，還是不够，必須要有實際行動，就是說實踐戰爭的一切任務。自覺產生信念，實踐配合信念，這個自覺才有光明的結果。</p>

<h3>印度塞克敎徒　反英大示威　雙方會發生激烈衝突</h3>
<p>仰光七日中央社電　印度屢次發生反英暴動，今已波及塞克敎徒，二日値塞克敎第十代敎主壽辰之時，其形勢已趨惡化。據悉：旁遮普省西北邊省及聯合各省之塞克人與英官憲之衝突事件，會數度發生，其中所謂塞克人鄕土之旁遮普省之各都市及鄉村之居民，曾因反抗德督府命令，以及塞克敎徒之反英示威運動，致使雙方發生激烈之衝突。同時英官憲曾對示威之羣衆開槍射擊，故羣衆喪亡頗多，其中以哈利布拉之塞克八與英官憲方而之衝突最為激烈，並有婦女參加。同時，塞克之愛國志士，曾大書反英標謂，並揮舉反英旗帳舉行示威遊行，因此英官憲即開槍攻擊，雙方激鬥達數小時之久，央方此種高壓手段，致使全塞克敎徒之反英情緒又為激烈，雙方之形勢亦益趨惡化。目下英官憲對各都市之動態極其注意，並實施警戒，茲悉，英印西北兩省省長鹽於目前哈利布拉情勢之嚴重，為調查實况起見，業抵該地視察。</p>
<h3>日安藤中將　晉陸軍大將　西原任機械本部部長</h3>
<p>東京七日中央社電　日陸軍省七日發表陸軍中將安藤利吉昇為陸軍大將，任命陸軍中將西原一策為陸軍機械本部部長，茲將安滕大將略歷誌次：安藤氏大正三年十一月畢業陸軍大學，大正八年一月奉派赴英硏究軍事，大正十二年四年任職於參謀本部，大正十四年八月為駐印度武官。昭和六年三月任陸軍省兵務課長，昭和七年五月任日駐英大使館武官，昭和十一年四月任駐滿部隊長，昭和十二年八　任敎育總監本部部長，昭和十三年五月任在華兵團長，同年任華南方面日軍最高指揮官，昭和十六年十一月任台軍司令官以迄現在。</p>
<h3>松島報道部長談　世界戰局展望　敵方反攻焦急異常</h3>
<p>中央社訊艦隊報道部松島部長，於昨（七）日在滬聯合報道常會席上，發表展近世界戰局展望。</p>
<p>敵方損失</p>
<p>據謂關於太平洋作戰情況，如所羅門·新幾內亞兩方面，有馬紹爾·波根維爾等四處，激戰頗烈，敵方損失慘重，計旗艦九艘，航空母艦二十四艘，巡洋艦二十二艘，巡洋艦驅逐艦十二艘，驅逐艦十艘，運輸艦十一艘，及其他小艦無數，敵方反攻焦急異常，我人可在莫斯科會談及德黑　會談洞悉無遺。</p>
<p>生產比較</p>
<p>繼就日美兩國生產力比較，如橡皮，·錫·鋁·鋼鐵·煤·石油等等，日木生產力已足與美國相等，日本自積極生產以來，至今已佔為世界第二。目前美國飛機，除本身亟切需要外，且洪給英國。蘇聯·重慶，如此龐大消耗，今後常為日本有利，乃將飛機損失比較，為美五與日一之比。値茲本年第二期增產作戰，故對一城一市之得失，無關大局，至要者乃國內盡量生產。此外敵方潛水艇在南洋與日木之間，雖頗活躍，而日本嚴密防範，宛如鐵璧，休想得逞。</p>
<p>虛張聲勢</p>
<p>次連大陸戰况，敵在華中·華南一帶破壞，及在長江流域與南方阻　交通、經日本在各處嚴密防術，損失頗小。他如緬甸情形，敵方反攻，經日軍攻擊後，使敵損失頗多。現時日本努力生產，突飛猛晋，今後在生產方面，當有驚人之進展。再如歐戰方而，義大　戰綫方面，目前似　　人停頓狀態，德蘇戰局暫無重火發展，反軸心方面，自德黑閘會議後，第二期戰况，在伊利比亞·巴爾幹半島戰略上，歐美方面頗為困難，僅盧張聲勢，如入螺旋狀態。最後盼望中國民衆，在此期間，以同生共死之精神，堅強信心，與日本協力，完遂最後勝利云云。</p>

<h3>全部地中海沿岸德防禦工事堅強　堪與「大西洋鋼壁」相媲美</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國新聞社由軍界方而獲悉地中海沿岸之防禦工事已加强，足以媲美北歐與西歐之大西洋鋼壁，德工兵一聯隊在地中海沿岸已埋下地雷十萬枚以上，各根據地之地雷陣地前後相啣接，因而足以抵禦敵之坦克軍與登陸部隊。同時地中海沿岸已築有各種障碍物與射火機，不但足以保護戰車之壕溝，而且亦足以保護防地之第一綫。英美侵犯軍在西歐與東南歐將遭遇極大之堡壘，全部前綫由挪威·經丹麥·沿北海岸·海峽沿岸·與大西洋沿岸而至西班牙，共長五千公里，全綫均有堡壘，障碍物與作戰陣地，並有各種口徑之大砲數千尊。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據悉：一種新型海岸砲正在此間試驗中。此砲用新型砲彈，不特可以射擊海中目的物，並可擊中遠距離高空飛行密集隊形之轟炸機，似此敵機將不敢再密集飛行，而於德戰鬥機迫近敵機時，得有進擊之機會。迄今戰鬥機及驅逐機均需進擊一整隊之敵機，用此新法可以對付單獨飛行之　炸機。</p>
<h3>羅美爾視察防務德軍正嚴陣以待</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　「德軍當局六日就羅美爾元帥視察大西洋方面防務事宣稱：羅美爾元帥前會偕幕僚視察荷蘭方面之德軍防備情况，對沿岸防備設施詳細視察終了後，更赴西歐佔領地帶視察，幷撿閱各機械化師團機械化擲彈兵師團及各種技術師團，確認合部隊均可發揮無遺憾之戰力。又德元首行營幷就德軍迎擊反軸心軍登陸作戰之準備宣稱，英美報紙頻宣傳反軸心軍之登陸作戰，幷對登陸地點加以種種臆測，然德軍已早作邀擊之準備，反軸心軍企圖登陸時，即知德軍防衛如何堅强矣。</p>
<h3>英美對西葡施壓力企圖開闢第二戰綫</h3>
<p>沮里克七日中央社電　同盟社特派員荷力宮奇訊：自德黑蘭會議以來，英美對西葡之壓力日益增加，故反軸心有實行在伊比利安半島侵入之可能，如此即可實踐開闢第二戰綫之諾言。在伊比利亞之登陸，可使英美免去正面攻擊英法海峽西面鋼壁之困難，因根據英軍事評論家赫德之意見，以為攻法海岸係不適宜之行動，因在决定性攻擊之前，必先破壞德軍防禦均勢，為更覺有效也。於控制西班牙北部航空根據地之後，則對里安灣及比斯開灣之行動必較便利，因陸上部隊易於建立廣大及安　之橋頭堡也。且伊比利亞之登陸倘吿大敗，此並不如海峽登陸失敗之足以直接影響英國。</p>
<h3>西班牙軍隊　對元首效忠</h3>
<p>里斯本六日中央社電　據馬德里電稱：西班牙陸長阿塞西厄最近曾向弗朗三元　表明全國軍隊忠誠擁護領袖之决意，弗朗哥乃特舉行演說，激勵國民精誠團結，擁護西班牙之自由獨立。大意謂，五年戰亂，民不聊生，各方面莫不痛惑西班牙陸軍擁有實力，可保全我國人之生存，可衛護我目由與獨立：我等當對西班牙之使命，寄予絕對之信賴而一致團結渡過戰亂。</p>
<p>瑞與京城七日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦息：蘇聯宣布西班牙　師團仍在東綫作戰之消息後，英官方通信社昨透露稱，英政府認西班牙監師團仍在東綫作戰為不滿意，已將此意知照西政府矣。</p>
<h3>土耳其內閣　舉行會議</h3>
<p>安加拉七日中央社電　據此間公佈：土耳其內閣昨舉行會議，由總理　隆拉卓格魯主席。</p>
<p>斯丹埠七日中央社電　土議員亞爾淸著文論稱：開羅會議已澄淸土國之局勢，雖英美方面供給軍火，土國兵力仍不能與有現代兵備之軍隊相抗衡云。</p>
<h3>反軸心侵歐軍　大本營設倫敦　樊克林任英防軍總司令</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據倫敦來訊，標準晚報載稱：艾森霍華將軍之所謂「侵歐大本營」將設在倫敦。</p>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據海通社訊，倫敦昨日發表官報稱：樊克林將軍現已被任為英國國防軍總司令。</p>
<h3>邱吉爾病　別有作用　衆信出於偽裝</h3>
<p>里斯本七日中央社電　據海通社訊：開羅觀祭家信英首相邱吉爾之病，係出於偽裝，其目的在拖延對斯達林諾言之實踐，甚至企圖取消之此項重要之諾言，是否與進攻歡洲有關，則並無所知，惟觀察家信必與進攻事有關。證之羅斯福關注邱吉爾之病狀而非斯達林，可以信矣。回憶十二月十四日英外相艾登稱邱氏略感疲勞，惟身體仍佳，但於四十八小時後副首相阿特里在下院宜稱，邱吉爾左肺發炎，須臥床數日，然僅於二日後邱氏肺部之發炎業已退去。</p>
<h3>德忍受空襲　民氣益奮發　誓與敵周旋於疆塲</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾在最近一期之「國家週刋」著文稱，受空襲之害最深之人民，對最後勝利之期望亦愈切，因人民深知旣損失之財產，惟有最後勝利後始可恢復。英美空襲之暴行不但見之於破壞之成績，抑且增强德國人民之意志，故總國民氣非但未被消沉，日益趨團結，此項發展實出敵方意料之外。他日德國對英國烏嶼發動報復措施時，德國全國人心將為之大快，决無同情心之可言。關於反軸心國進攻西歐問題，郭氏續稱，英美軍若發動此項戰爭時，將發現空襲對德國人民心理上之影響，來自被襲城市之德國兵士將與主動空襲之仇人周旋於戰塲之上矣。郭氏最後論及德國城市復與之計劃稱，建築最新式住宅之計劃現已在進行中</p>
<h3>英美機襲德　損失近百架</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德元首行　發表：　反軸心機隊近曾畫襲基爾港，及德本土西部與西部佔領地數處，茲判明德軍於空戰中，共擊落反軸心機八十一架，內有重轟炸機六十三架。　英空軍曾於五日夜空襲德本土北部斯德丁，施行恐怖轟炸，據臨時報吿，敵四發轟炸機十六架被擊落。反軸心空軍於過去二十四小時內，計喪失飛機九十七架，內有四發轟炸機七十九架，德軍僅損失戰鬥機廿架。</p>
<h3>羅馬已喪失　軍事價値　德軍作戰成功</h3>
<p>羅馬七日中央社電　英美軍自去秋九月以來，在東部地區僅推進距離羅馬一百二十公里之地點，在西部地區則推進一百四十公里之地點，且遭損害極大，其間德軍已加强北部及南部之前進基地。南部戰錢之中心目標固在於羅馬攻防綫，但羅馬攻防戰在敵方觀之，政治與心理之要素，較之軍事者為多也。羅馬現在由行政上觀之，已喪失首都意義，但對於義國民依然為絕大之精神中心。德軍維持南部戰綫之目的，在東制敵軍勢力於此點。使敵方今後之作戰發生困難，故德軍在義大利作戰實已獲得成功。但從另一方面而觀，戰爭全仗鐵與數量，反軸心軍以巨砲不斷轟擊，作驚人之濫費，其行動雖極遲緩，但究已向前推進。德軍視羅馬已無軍事價値，如屬可能時不妨撤退，衆認德軍將一到時機，立即發動攻勢。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據海通社訊：義西部前踐本月四日起美軍加緊進攻，但美第五軍尙未全部參戰，僅在米納結及卡西諾以北進攻德軍陣地而已。美軍攻勢之目標，殆已突人里利河流域，使德軍不能牽掣向里利河與迦里格里諾河合流處推進之美軍。至前晚為止，該區仍在激戰中。東面英軍被阻於福爾羅河兩岸，戰况已趨緩和，其原因或由於英第八軍司令之更迭，亦未可知，英軍將領不善應變。李希將軍或將繼續蒙高茂萊之戰略，而圖攻至貝斯卡拉。</p>
<h3>蘇軍不恤犧牲　展開新攻勢　貝迪契夫德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　據德軍當局宣稱：德軍巳自齊托米爾南方要衝貝迪契夫市（Berdichev）撤退。</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：蘇軍出動槍兵九師團，機械化兵若干隊，以及坦克車約二百五十輛，在轟伯河河套以及基洛伏格勒之東南與西北，實行大規模之進攻，强大之蘇坦克軍集團在車大急迫砲火之後，向若干據點之德軍戰綫同時發動襲擊，但德軍在各處均堅守其陣地，並阻止敵之突破，該區戰事現仍在進行中，查冬季大戰原來所在之基輔齊托米爾區，蘇軍在貝拉耶察爾柯夫附近，實行　次猛攻，此處德軍防綫已經縮短而增强，星期三“蘇軍主要之壓力，係針對貝迪契夫區以及齊托米爾之　與西南，蘇軍迭次企圖實入德軍陣地，　引　極東大之戰事，貝迪契夫東南與西南之德軍高頭陣地，竭力抵禦蘇軍大隊之進攻，因而使防守貝迪契夫西部之德軍得以逐步撤退至市鎭以西預先佈置完備之陣地，</p>
<p>蘇軍戰略</p>
<p>柏林七日中央社電　海通社訊：蘇軍冬季攻勢愈演愈烈，進攻重心在伐吐丁將軍指揮下之南路，但柯奈夫將軍之軍隊亦巳展開新攻勢．伐吐丁之右翼，現停滯在自奧里夫斯克至諾維格勒伏林斯克一綫之西面，其中路則欲衝過貝迪契夫加薩丁一綫，向布格河上游挺進，蘇軍先鋒部隊現正在該處與德軍激戰中。德軍採取彈性戰略，時予反攻，伐吐丁左翼現復向比拉耶察爾柯夫方面施以壓力，該處德軍原與烏克蘭普杜里挨邊區及大聶伯河灣之德軍呼應作戰，但現已受到兩方面之威脅。即　受西面伐吐了先鋒之威脅，　受東面蘇軍自契爾喀賽突進部隊之威脅，敵軍顯欲利用此一戰爭，以决定大轟伯河　方面之戰局。柯奈夫將軍所麗之進攻，即在牽制德軍在基洛伏格勒迤東及克里伏洛格迤北之德軍，傳伐吐了可推動其南翼部隊，威脅德軍之西翼甚至德軍之後方．東綫中路蘇軍曾自普洛伊斯克向莫奇列夫與克里希夫問之德軍聶伯河橋頭堡進攻，但並非大攻勢，維特勃斯克方面敵軍進犯該城西北德軍陣地，即予反攻擎退</p>

<h3>各交戰國的徵兵年齡</h3>
<p>英國</p>
<p>英國在第二次世界大戰勃發，張伯倫首相發表對德宣戰演說後，即於一九三九年九月三日全體一致通過「國民皆兵法」，即日公佈，對足十八至不足四十一歲者諜以徵兵的義務。各級年齡陸續實施徵兵。至翌年，動員數達四百五十五萬。但這不過是暫時的，至一九四一年一月二十五日，布吿對足十八歲六個月至四十歲各級年齡的徵兵令，更在同年十一月將義務兵役年齡擴充到足十八歲以上到五十一歲，本年一月，所有足四十六歲者業已登記完畢。</p>
<p>對學生最初其最低年齡為二十歲，以後逐漸降低為十九歲，十八歲半，至一九四一年底以後，達十八歲者亦立即得以徵集。但對理工科中生於一九二五年的學生，允其延長至　　完了。醫科及齒科學生免除兵役，不滿十九歲者不得派適於海外。本來英國戰時體制的大　，在第二次大戰風雲險惡的一九三九年八月二十四日，因「緊急國防法」而確立，但因强制徵兵及義務勞働的規定不合國情，至大戰勃發後的九月三日，倉惶地制定對足十八歲以上的男子强制微兵。但在苦於人的資源的英國，道徵兵年齡的減低，在生產力上有極大的影響，因而其苦悶愈趨深刻。至一九四○年；見到比利時，荷蘭，法國北部方面央軍的慘敗後，邱吉爾內閣制定前述的「擴充緊急國防法效力的法律」，決定「對全體國民得以其個人的勞力及財產供國家之用」，以徵用國民之權賦與政府。</p>
<p>因此，由於國民登記法（一九三九年九月五日）及產業登記令（一九四〇年八月七日），對滿二十一歲至六十五歲的熟練勞働者，課以登記的義務，繼於一九四一年十一月，把登記的範圍擴充到足十八歲到五十一歲的男子及足十八歲　四十歲的女子。並斷然强制徴用二十一歲到三十一歲的女子。之後，在一九四一年十男，將女子的登記適用年齡擴充到四十五歲，更於本年七月二十九日，艾登外相公吿將男女勞働力動員年齡男子減低至十八歲，女子提高至五十歲，由此可以證明英國在人的資源上是怎樣的困難。和日本綽有餘裕的情形比較起來，相形見絀。</p>
<p>蘇聯</p>
<p>據一九三九年九月一日公佈的兵役法，男子徵兵年齡，在微一月一日起至十二月三十一日止），足十九歲者，及中等學校卒業而足十八歲者，徵集為現役，兵役滿期為五十歲。此外，並規定醫師及有特殊技能的女子，登記於陸海軍而年齡得十九歲至五十歲者，編入第二預備役。之後，關於兵役法者就完全沒有公佈。據最近的情報，由於戰局激烈的要求，極端擴張服兵役的期限，足十七歲到五十五歲的男子，從事直接的戰爭事務。</p>
<p>據勞働法，徵用年齡限界男子從十六歲到五十九歲，女子從十六歲到五十四歲，為應付最近的食糧增產，農村勞働力方面從十四歲起就巳微用，在補助勞働方面，甚至於使用十二歲的少女少男。</p>
<p>德國</p>
<p>德國德國，據一九三五年三月十六日公佈的兵役法，得徵集從十八歲到四十五議的男子。之後，兵役法的修正就沒有發表，但實際上，大約自去年起，對足十七歲也已實施兵役訓練。又德國的勞働員關係法規之主要者如次：據一九三九年九月十五日的緊急勞務令第一次施行令，規定從十六歲以上到七十九歲者在徵用之例。又據同月二十二日的學生學從配置令，規定十六歲以上的男女學生在農忙期（五月至十男的期間）的動員措置。又自本年一月二十七日的戰時勞務申請令公佈以後，足十六歲到六十五歲的德國男子及足十七歲到四十五歲的德國女子，課以向所屬勞働局申請的義務。更據本年一月一十九日·三十日頒布，二月五日施行的命令，關閉戰時下國民生活上無絕對必要的商業全部娛樂塲·酒店·及其他奢侈品販賣等，及一部分家具·烟草及其他零售商店的一部）之經營。（翔：譯自十二月二十四日東京朝日新聞）（完）</p>

<h3>中國參戰一周年　廣田部長談話</h3>
<p>中央社訊日本大使館上海事務所廣田情報部長。於昨（七）日在陸海外聯合報道常會席上，就中國參戰一週年紀念發表談話，據調；本月九日為中國參戰一週年紀念日，日本在此一年來，盡量為中國協力，中國對英美宣戰此舉，貴為中國表示打擊英美侵略之决意，及奠定建設新中國之基礎。關於中國革命之目的，為確保自由獨立，以建設近代國家之新中國，為達到目的，必須排除英美勢力，是以中國對英美宣戰，即為達到革命之目的。在此意義下、中國對英美宣戰，表示對戰爭上特別努力，並確立中國戰時體制，為建設中國及完遂革命而努力。目前戰爭，不但中國之參戰，而為日本及大東亞各民族之戰爭，亦可言大東亞各民族之戰爭，如東亞各民族，日本·中國，爪哇·菲律賓·緬甸·泰國，越南。印度間，有任何一國遭受英美侵略時，東亞各國均將不能存在，當應羣起聯合打倒之。中國孫總理中山先生遺著大亞細亞主義中，亦曾提及。此外去年十二月六日大東亞共同宣，亦明白公佈，故中國前途與亞細亞各民族之命運，當應密切集合，是以中國對英美宣戰，亦可謂亞細亞各民族十億人民對英美之共同穴戰。自中國國民政府汪主席向中國民衆昭示與日本同甘共苦及同主共死，本人十二分之　敬。中國宣戰第一年中，由於準備上種種原因效果較小，在第二年來，本人頗希望中國在戰爭上之努力，更為深切。本人深信目前戰爭，為决定將來　世紀之世界形勢，戰後之世界與戰前之世界形勢，當為完全不同，故我人深切希望分擔新的世界之建沒者，在担任新世界建設之前，爭取此次戰爭之勝利。本年一九四四年為世界戰爭之决戰年，在軸心與反軸心，均已明自表明，在茲决戰年程上，値此中國參戰一週年紀念之期，本人不勝期待，本年戰局為育極大之展開。</p>

<p>短評</p>
<h3>明瞭行旅痛苦</h3>
<p>華中鐵道公司新任總裁鄭洪年氏，昨日招待各界，作到任後之寒暄。</p>
<p>近年交通問題，頗為與論所不滿，其原因自在管理不善，秩序紊亂，行旅痛苦視為畏途。華中鐵道公可雖圖迎合與情，力謀改善，可是，枝節補救，無裨整局，距離理想仍遠。最近改選　洪年氏擔任總裁，料想也是準備改善的一點。</p>
<p>鄭洪年氏，我們知共為交通界前輩，對於鐵道需要如何管理，相信必很明暸，可是，對於民間行旅的如何痛苦與不便，尤須澈底明瞭。因為改善目前的交通問題，僅憑些平時糧騐是不够的·而必須有切合現狀的適應方法，才可言改善。於此，我們提出下列三點，以期待　氏：</p>
<p>必須有事業心。以經營事業的恒心，謀鐵路管理之逐漸改善。</p>
<p>必須有英演的勇氣。如何改善管理方法，决定以後，務須以堅决的勇氣，持之以恒，才能勝任。</p>
<p>必須對症下藥。調查行旅感到痛苦的實况，探究原因，施以對策。閉門造車，枝節辦法，决無成效。</p>
<p>最後，我們知道二十六年以前京滬滬杭兩鐵路管理最佳，行旅最便，向為各路模範。常然，現在我們希望從速的見諸恢復。</p>

<p>經濟界　評言</p>
<h3>官民合作</h3>
<p>陳市長答復中央社記者叩詢市府對物價問題之措置，可謂聲色俱厲，而「戰時物價問題，當非簡單，欲謀澈底之抑平，自非官民合作實難為功」一語，尤覺語重心長，陳市長認為抬高物價，不僅刺激人心，影響社會，簡直是危害民生，擾亂社會秩序之行為，所以，此次市府已下最大决心，切實抑平本市物價，嗟吾小民，獲聆此訊，眞如大旱之望雲霓了！</p>
<p>可是，話要說回來了，管理社會的政治與法律條例，是一種無形的機器，所以我們稱行政組織為機關；機器的圓滑運用，固有賴於機器本身的健全，同時，也有賴於機器本身以外如機器油一額的東西來帮助它。假定市府與物資統制機關是抑平物價的一座機器，那末，人民的協助，便等於機器油一般，有之則圓轉自如，無之則滯礙難動。我們感覺抑平物價的機油，至少應有兩種：其一是商人的道德行為，其一是市民的節約行為，前者是要商人以社會公　福利為重，勿懷暴利思想，囤積主要商品，擅自抬高物價，後者是要巿民以節衣節食節用為重，勿抱浪費習慣，視通貨如泥沙，視廢物如敝展；必須耍有這樣一種雙重的合作，那末，物價與物資統制工作之進行，方才可以事半而功倍，所以言抑平物價，總要，官民合作。</p>
<h3>物資統審會　調查各廠生產　盡量供給各廠燃料</h3>
<p>邇來本市燃料問題，頗為各界關懷。各大小工廠亦大都因燃料問題，生產效率逐漸減低，對於工商實業界前途，殊有影響。物資統制審議會上海事務所有鑒及此，最近特派調查人員赴各重要廠家詳細調查，舉儿皂燭，火柴，及各關民生之工廠，均在調查之列，對於各廠之生產數量存底，及所需燃料，無不詳予調查。俟統計後，設法與有關方面商議。盡量援助供給，務各廠生產量不致受燃料響而減低。</p>

<h3>The Essence of the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>As we prepare to commemorate the first anniversary of our participation in the war, we feel it necessary to re-examine the essence of the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is, in reality, a war of liberation for the billion oppressed people of Asia. In the past, India and Burma were first exploited by the piratical British, who used strategies to alienate the various states, classes, and religions of India, causing them to fight among themselves and live as slaves, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people each year. Following this, the British and Dutch conquered indigenous peoples of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, etc., seizing the world's largest resources, and using these vast resources to invade the independent nations of China and Japan in Greater East Asia. The United States, under the guise of humanitarianism, practiced imperialism, traversed the Pacific Ocean, seized the Philippines, reduced the islands' inherent culture to ashes, and further colluded with Britain to indulge their ambitions within China.</p>
<p>Under the aggression of Britain and the United States, we have been poisoned for over a century. Not only is the inherent culture of East Asia, spanning four thousand years, in imminent danger, but even the lives of the peoples of Greater East Asia are threatened.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War is a war of self-defense for the peoples of Greater East Asia to break free from the iron heels of Britain and the United States and seek survival. We must not only completely expel the forces of Britain and the United States from East Asia, but also fundamentally shatter the residual Anglo-American ideologies of racial inequality.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, has already laid the foundation for a certain victory, and has given rise to newly independent nations such as Burma and the Philippines. At the same time, representatives from the seven nations of Greater East Asia have agreed on the five construction principles for Greater East Asia: Coexistence and co-prosperity; independence and amity; cultural flourishing; economic prosperity; and contributing to world progress. With these five principles as the ideal for building Greater East Asia and achieving victory in the Greater East Asia War, what should we do? First, intensify the collaboration between China and Japan to establish a posture of cooperative decisive battle among the nations of Greater East Asia. Second, fully mobilize all levels and sectors of the nation to concentrate efforts on increasing production in order to achieve victory in the long war.</p>
<p>In short, this war is a common war for all the nations and countries of Greater East Asia. It has been a year since we joined the war, but we have not directly undertaken frontline tasks. In terms of the obligation to participate in the war and the obligation to jointly build Greater East Asia, we absolutely cannot shirk our due responsibilities. If the frontline battles are solely shouldered by the brave soldiers of allied nations, then we have an unshirkable duty to provide supplies from the rear. Therefore, how to complete the work of the rear supply base, to continuously supply the frontline soldiers, and to persist in long-term warfare, is the direction that our entire nation, from top to bottom, should strive towards together. In simple terms, the government should promptly complete the wartime system and implement the outline of wartime economic policies, especially increasing production and stabilizing prices. The people, on the one hand, should do their best to increase production in accordance with government instructions, and on the other hand, save and accumulate wealth to prepare for rear supplies.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War can be said to be a war of awakening for the Asian peoples. However, in terms of striving for certain victory, awakening alone is not enough. The Asian peoples must have a firm belief in victory. Even with a firm belief, it is still not enough; there must be practical action, that is, the fulfillment of all the tasks of war. Awakening produces belief, and practice complements belief; only then will this awakening have bright results.</p>

<h3>Sikh Demonstrations in India Against the British, Fierce Clashes Occur</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) - Anti-British riots have repeatedly occurred in India, and they have now spread to the Sikhs. The situation has deteriorated on the 2nd, which was the birthday of the tenth Sikh Guru. It is learned that clashes between Sikhs and British officials have occurred several times in the Punjab, Northwest Frontier Province, and United Provinces. Among them, residents of cities and villages in the Punjab, the so-called homeland of the Sikhs, have resisted the orders of the Governor and staged anti-British demonstrations by Sikhs, resulting in fierce clashes between the two sides. At the same time, British officials opened fire on the demonstrating crowds, resulting in many casualties among the crowds. Among them, the clash between the Sikhs and British officials in Haripura was the most intense, with women participating. At the same time, Sikh patriotic figures wrote anti-British slogans in large characters and held demonstrations and parades with anti-British flags. Therefore, British officials immediately opened fire and attacked, and the two sides fought fiercely for several hours. This high-pressure tactic by the central government has further intensified the anti-British sentiment of all Sikhs, and the situation between the two sides has become increasingly worse. Currently, British officials are paying close attention to the movements in various cities and implementing security measures. It is learned that the governors of the British-Indian Northwest provinces, alarmed by the seriousness of the situation in Haripura, have arrived there to inspect the situation in order to investigate the facts.</p>

In August of Taisho 14 (1925), he was the military attaché to India. In March of Showa 6 (1931), he served as the Chief of the Military Affairs Section of the Ministry of the Army.

In November of Showa 16 (1941), he served as the commander of the Taiwan Army, and has remained in that position until now.</p>
<h3>Minister of Information Matsushima Discusses Outlook on World War Situation, Enemy's Counterattack Anxious Beyond Measure</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch - Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Information Department, at the Joint Press Conference in Shanghai yesterday (7th), gave his view on the future of the world war.</p>
<p>Enemy Losses</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of the Pacific War, such as the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, fierce battles are raging in four locations, including the Marshall Islands and Bougainville. The enemy's losses have been severe, with a total of nine flagships, twenty-four aircraft carriers, twenty-two cruisers, twelve cruiser destroyers, ten destroyers, eleven transport ships, and countless other small vessels. The enemy is extremely anxious to counterattack. We can see this clearly in the Moscow Conference and the Tehran Conference.</p>
<p>Production Comparison</p>
<p>Continuing to compare the production capacity of Japan and the United States, such as rubber, tin, aluminum, steel, coal, petroleum, etc., Japan's production capacity is already equal to that of the United States. Since Japan actively started production, it has now become the second largest in the world. Currently, the United States' aircraft, in addition to its own urgent needs, are also supplied to Britain, the Soviet Union, and Chongqing. With such enormous consumption, it will be advantageous for Japan in the future. When comparing aircraft losses, the ratio is five for the US to one for Japan. With the second phase of increased production operations in this year, the gains and losses of one city are not related to the overall situation. The most important thing is to maximize domestic production. In addition, although enemy submarines are quite active in the waters between the South Seas and Japan, Japan's strict defense is like an iron wall, and they cannot succeed.</p>
<p>Bluffing</p>
<p>Next, regarding the situation on the mainland, the enemy's destruction in central and southern China and the obstruction of traffic in the Yangtze River basin and the south, after Japan's strict defense techniques everywhere, the losses are quite small. As for the situation in Burma, the enemy's counterattack, after the Japanese army's attack, caused the enemy a great deal of losses. At present, Japan is working hard on production, and its rapid progress is promising. In the future, there will be amazing progress in production. Furthermore, regarding the European war, the Italian front seems to be at a standstill. There has been no major development in the German-Soviet war for the time being. On the anti-Axis side, since the Tehran Conference, the second phase of the war situation, in terms of the strategic situation in Libya and the Balkan Peninsula, is quite difficult for Europe and the United States. It is only a bluff, and it is entering a spiral state. Finally, I hope that the Chinese people, during this period, will have the spirit of living and dying together, have strong faith, cooperate with Japan, and complete the final victory.</p>

<h3>The German Defenses Along the Entire Mediterranean Coast are Strong, Comparable to the "Atlantic Wall"</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency learned from military sources that the defenses along the Mediterranean coast have been strengthened, making them comparable to the Atlantic Wall of Northern and Western Europe. A German engineering regiment has laid more than 100,000 mines along the Mediterranean coast. The minefields of each base are connected end-to-end, making them sufficient to resist enemy tank armies and landing forces. At the same time, various obstacles and fire-throwing devices have been built along the Mediterranean coast, which are not only sufficient to protect tank trenches, but also sufficient to protect the first line of defense. The Anglo-American invading forces will encounter extremely large fortresses in Western and Southeastern Europe. The entire front line stretches from Norway, through Denmark, along the North Sea coast, the English Channel coast, and the Atlantic coast to Spain, a total length of 5,000 kilometers. The entire line has fortresses, obstacles, and battle positions, and thousands of artillery pieces of various calibers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that a new type of coastal artillery is being tested here. This artillery uses a new type of shell that can not only strike targets in the sea, but also hit bombers in dense formations flying at high altitudes from a long distance. In this way, enemy planes will no longer dare to fly in dense formations, and German fighters will have the opportunity to attack when they approach enemy planes. Up to now, fighters and destroyers have had to attack an entire team of enemy planes. This new method can be used to deal with individually flying bombers.</p>
<h3>Rommel Inspects Defenses, German Army on High Alert</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - "German authorities announced on the 6th regarding Marshal Rommel's inspection of defenses on the Atlantic front: Marshal Rommel previously inspected the German army's defense situation in the Netherlands with his staff. After a detailed inspection of the coastal defense facilities, he went to inspect the occupied areas of Western Europe, and reviewed the various mechanized divisions, mechanized grenadier divisions, and various technical divisions, confirming that all units can exert their combat power without regret. Furthermore, the German leader's headquarters announced regarding the German army's preparations to counter the anti-Axis army's landing operation that Anglo-American newspapers frequently promoted the anti-Axis army's landing operation, and made various speculations about the landing location. However, the German army had already made preparations for an ambush. When the anti-Axis army attempts to land, they will know how strong the German defenses are.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Put Pressure on Spain and Portugal in an Attempt to Open a Second Front</h3>
<p>Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) - Domei News Agency correspondent Holly Gong Qi's dispatch: Since the Tehran Conference, the pressure of Britain and the United States on Spain and Portugal has been increasing day by day. Therefore, the anti-Axis has the possibility of invading the Iberian Peninsula. In this way, they can fulfill their promise to open a second front. Landing on the Iberian Peninsula can save Britain and the United States from the difficulty of directly attacking the steel wall west of the English Channel. According to the opinion of British military commentator Hurd, attacking the French coast is not a suitable action, because before a decisive attack, it is necessary to destroy the German army's defensive balance first, which is more effective. After controlling the northern Spanish air bases, operations in the Bay of Biscay will be more convenient, because land forces can easily establish a large and secure bridgehead. Moreover, if the Iberian landing is a major defeat, it will not directly affect Britain as much as a failed landing in the English Channel.</p>
<h3>Spanish Army Professes Loyalty to the Leader</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Madrid: Spanish Army Chief Acesio recently expressed to Generalissimo Franco the determination of the entire army to loyally support the leader. Franco then gave a speech to encourage national unity and to support Spain's freedom and independence. The gist of it was that five years of war have left the people impoverished. All parties are painfully aware that the Spanish army has the strength to protect the survival of our people and to defend our freedom and independence: we should have absolute trust in Spain's mission and unite to overcome the war.</p>
<p>Bern and Capital, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from London: After the Soviet Union announced that the Spanish division was still fighting on the Eastern Front, the British official news agency revealed yesterday that the British government was dissatisfied with the Spanish garrison division still fighting on the Eastern Front and had informed the Spanish government of this.</p>
<h3>Turkish Cabinet Holds Meeting</h3>
<p>Ankara, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a public announcement here: the Turkish cabinet held a meeting yesterday, presided over by Prime Minister Longla Zhuogelu.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 7th (Central News Agency) - Turkish parliamentarian Yarchi wrote an article stating that the Cairo Conference has clarified the situation in Turkey. Even if Britain and the United States supply military weapons, Turkey's military strength still cannot compete with an army with modern armaments.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Invasion of Europe Headquarters Established in London, Franklin Appointed Commander-in-Chief of British Defense Forces</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, the Standard Evening News reported that General Eisenhower's so-called "Invasion of Europe Headquarters" will be established in London.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch, London announced in the official gazette yesterday that General Franklin has now been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British National Defense Forces.</p>
<h3>Churchill's Illness Has Other Implications, Many Believe it is a Pretense</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: A Cairo observer believes that British Prime Minister Churchill's illness is a pretense, the purpose of which is to delay the implementation of promises made to Stalin, and even attempt to cancel them. It is unknown whether this important promise is related to the invasion of Europe, but the observer believes that it must be related to the invasion. This can be confirmed by the fact that Roosevelt is concerned about Churchill's illness rather than Stalin's. Recall that on December 14th, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that Churchill felt slightly tired, but his health was still good, but 48 hours later, Deputy Prime Minister Attlee announced in the House of Commons that Churchill had pneumonia in his left lung and had to stay in bed for several days, but only two days later, the inflammation in Churchill's lung had subsided.</p>
<h3>Germans Endure Air Raids, National Spirit Rises, Vowing to Fight the Enemy on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels wrote in the latest issue of "National Weekly" that the people who have suffered the most from air raids are also the most hopeful for final victory, because the people know that the property that has been lost can only be recovered after the final victory. The atrocities of the Anglo-American air raids not only manifested themselves in the results of the destruction, but also strengthened the will of the German people. Therefore, the overall national spirit has not only not been depressed, but is becoming more and more united. This development is beyond the enemy's expectations. When Germany launches retaliatory measures against British islands in the future, the hearts of the entire German people will be greatly rejoiced, and there will be no sympathy to speak of. Regarding the anti-Axis invasion of Western Europe, Goebbels continued that if the Anglo-American army launches this war, they will discover the psychological impact of the air raids on the German people. German soldiers from the raided cities will fight the enemies who actively launched the air raids on the battlefield. Goebbels finally commented on Germany's urban recovery plan, saying that plans for the construction of the newest style of housing are already underway.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Planes Attack Germany, Losing Nearly a Hundred</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - German Leader's Headquarters announced: Anti-Axis air squadrons recently attacked Kiel, and several locations in western Germany and the occupied territories in the west. It has now been determined that the German army shot down a total of 81 anti-Axis planes in air combat, including 63 heavy bombers. The British Air Force raided Stettin in northern Germany on the night of the 5th, carrying out terror bombings. According to temporary reports, 16 enemy four-engine bombers were shot down. The anti-Axis air force has lost a total of 97 planes in the past 24 hours, including 79 four-engine bombers. The German army only lost 20 fighters.</p>
<h3>Rome Has Lost Its Military Value; German Army's Successful Operations</h3>
<p>Rome, 7th (Central News Agency) – Since last autumn, September, the Anglo-American forces have only advanced 120 kilometers in the eastern sector and 140 kilometers in the western sector, suffering heavy damage. Meanwhile, the German army has strengthened its forward bases in the north and south. The central objective of the southern front is the defense line of Rome, but in the enemy's view, political and psychological elements are more important than military ones. From an administrative standpoint, Rome has now lost its significance as a capital, but it remains a great spiritual center for the Italian people. The German army maintains the southern front to contain the enemy's forces at this point, making future operations difficult for the enemy. Therefore, the German army has indeed achieved success in its operations in Italy. However, from another perspective, war relies entirely on iron and numbers. The Axis forces continuously bombard with heavy artillery, wasting resources alarmingly. Although their actions are extremely slow, they have ultimately advanced. The German army considers Rome to have no military value and may retreat if possible. It is generally believed that the German army will launch an offensive as soon as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency: The American forces have intensified their offensive on the western front of Italy since the 4th of this month, but the entire U.S. Fifth Army has not yet participated in the battle. They are only attacking German positions north of Mignano and Cassino. The objective of the American offensive is likely to break into the Liri River valley, preventing the German army from hindering the American forces advancing towards the confluence of the Liri and Garigliano Rivers. As of the night before last, fierce fighting was still ongoing in that area. On the eastern front, the British army is being held back on both sides of the Forlì River, and the situation has become less intense. The reason for this may be the change of command of the British Eighth Army, which is unknown. The British generals are not good at adapting to changes. General Leese may continue Montgomery's strategy and attempt to attack Pescara.</p>
<h3>Soviet Army Disregards Sacrifices, Launches New Offensive; German Army Retreats from Berdichev</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a statement from the German military authorities: The German army has withdrawn from the strategically important city of Berdichev, south of Zhytomyr.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: The Soviet army has deployed nine rifle divisions, several mechanized units, and approximately 250 tanks, launching a large-scale offensive in the bend of the Hnylyi Tikych River and southeast and northwest of Kirovohrad. After a powerful and urgent artillery barrage, large Soviet tank groups simultaneously attacked the German lines at several points, but the German army held its ground everywhere and prevented the enemy from breaking through. Fighting is currently ongoing in the area. In the Kiev-Zhytomyr area, the original site of the winter battles, the Soviet army launched another fierce offensive near Bila Tserkva. The German defense line here has been shortened and strengthened. On Wednesday, the Soviet army's main pressure was directed at the Berdichev area and the northwest and southwest of Zhytomyr. The Soviet army repeatedly attempted to break into the German positions, leading to extremely intense fighting. The German high-ground positions southeast and southwest of Berdichev vigorously resisted the Soviet army's large-scale offensive, enabling the German forces defending the western part of Berdichev to gradually retreat to pre-arranged positions west of the town.</p>
<p>Soviet Strategy</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Hai Tong News Agency reports: The Soviet winter offensive is intensifying, with the main offensive focus on the southern route under the command of General Vatutin, but General Konev's troops have also launched a new offensive. Vatutin's right flank is currently stalled west of the line from Olevsk to Novohrad-Volynskyi, while his central route is attempting to cross the Berdichev-Koziatyn line and advance towards the upper reaches of the Southern Buh River. The Soviet vanguard units are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army in that area. The German army is adopting a flexible strategy, launching counterattacks from time to time. Vatutin's left flank is now exerting pressure on the Bila Tserkva area, where the German army originally coordinated operations with the German forces in the Putilo-Aibedryanskyi District of Ukraine and the Great Dnieper Bend, but is now threatened from two sides: threatened by Vatutin's vanguard from the west and threatened by Soviet forces breaking through from Cherkasy from the east. The enemy is clearly trying to use this war to determine the situation in the region of the Great Hnylyi Tikych River. General Konev's offensive is intended to contain the German forces east of Kirovohrad and north of Kryvyi Rih, with rumors that Vatutin may push his southern flank units to threaten the western flank of the German army or even the rear. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army launched an offensive from Propoisk towards the German Dnieper bridgehead between Mogilev and Krychev, but it was not a major offensive. In the Vitebsk area, the enemy forces attacked the German positions northwest of the city, but were repelled by a counterattack.</p>
<h3>German Scouts Use Masks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a report from the Hai Tong News Agency: The German army is now using masks to adapt to the specific environment of certain war zones. These masks are exclusively used by reconnaissance units.</p>
<h3>New York Holds Large-Scale Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>Amsterdam, 7th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, New York: Last night, air raid sirens wailed in New York City, which was "about to be endangered," anti-aircraft guns fired, and bombs exploded. The city's entire air defense equipment and population were mobilized. The mayor and many citizens ascended skyscrapers to observe the city's first large-scale air defense drill.</p>
<h3>Conscription Ages of Various Warring Nations</h3>
<p>England</p>
<p>After the outbreak of World War II and Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration of war against Germany, the United Kingdom unanimously passed the "National Service Act" on September 3, 1939, which was promulgated on the same day, imposing conscription obligations on those aged 18 to under 41. Conscription was implemented gradually for each age group. By the following year, the number of mobilized personnel reached 4.55 million. However, this was only temporary. On January 25, 1941, a conscription order was issued for those aged 18 years and 6 months to 40 years, and in November of the same year, the compulsory military service age was extended to those aged 18 to 51. By January of this year, all those aged 46 had completed registration.</p>
<p>Initially, the minimum age for students was 20, but it was gradually lowered to 19 and then 18 and a half. After the end of 1941, those who reached 18 were immediately conscripted. However, students majoring in science and engineering who were born in 1925 were allowed to extend their studies until completion. Medical and dental students were exempted from military service, and those under 19 were not allowed to be assigned overseas. The wartime system of Great Britain was established on August 24, 1939, due to the "Emergency Defence Act," amidst the perilous atmosphere of World War II. However, due to the provisions for compulsory conscription and compulsory labor being unsuited to the national conditions, the UK hastily enacted compulsory conscription for men aged 18 and over on September 3, after the outbreak of the war. However, in the United Kingdom, which was suffering from a shortage of human resources, the reduction of the conscription age had a significant impact on productivity, leading to increasingly profound distress. In 1940, after witnessing the disastrous defeat of the Allied forces in Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern France, the Churchill Cabinet formulated the aforementioned "Law to Expand the Effectiveness of the Emergency Defence Act," deciding that "the labor and property of all citizens may be used for national purposes," granting the government the power to requisition citizens.</p>
<p>Therefore, due to the National Registration Act (September 5, 1939) and the Industry Registration Order (August 7, 1940), skilled workers aged 21 to 65 were obligated to register. Subsequently, in November 1941, the scope of registration was extended to men aged 18 to 51 and women aged 18 to 40. The government resolutely enforced compulsory conscription of women aged 21 to 31. Later, in October 1941, the registration age for women was extended to 45, and on July 29 of this year, Foreign Secretary Eden announced that the age for mobilizing male and female labor would be lowered to 18 for men and raised to 50 for women. This demonstrates the difficulty the United Kingdom faced in terms of human resources, which pales in comparison to Japan's ample resources.</p>
<p>Soviet Union</p>
<p>According to the Military Service Law promulgated on September 1, 1939, men of conscription age (from January 1 to December 31), those who reached 19 years of age, and those who graduated from secondary school and reached 18 years of age, were conscripted into active service, with the term of military service ending at the age of 50. In addition, it was stipulated that doctors and women with special skills, registered with the army and navy and aged 19 to 50, would be incorporated into the second reserve. Since then, no further information regarding the Military Service Law has been publicly announced. According to recent information, due to the intense demands of the war situation, the term of military service has been extremely expanded, with men aged 17 to 55 engaged in direct war affairs.</p>
<p>According to the Labor Law, the age limit for conscription of men is from 16 to 59 and for women from 16 to 54. In order to cope with the recent increase in food production, labor in rural areas has been conscripted from the age of 14, and even girls and boys as young as 12 are being used for auxiliary labor.</p>
<p>Germany</p>
<p>According to the Military Service Law promulgated on March 16, 1935, Germany could conscript men aged 18 to 45. Since then, no amendments to the Military Service Law have been published, but in practice, military training has been implemented for those aged 17 since about last year. The main regulations concerning German labor mobilization are as follows: According to the First Enforcement Order of the Emergency Labor Service Order of September 15, 1939, those aged 16 to 79 were subject to conscription. According to the Student Deployment Order of September 22 of the same month, male and female students aged 16 and over were subject to mobilization during the busy farming season (from May to October). Since the promulgation of the Wartime Labor Application Order of January 27 of this year, German men aged 16 to 65 and German women aged 17 to 45 have been obligated to apply to their respective labor bureaus. Furthermore, according to the order promulgated on January 19 and 30 and implemented on February 5 of this year, the operation of all commercial entertainment venues, hotels, and other luxury goods sales outlets (as well as a portion of furniture, tobacco, and other retail stores) that are not absolutely necessary for national life under wartime conditions has been closed.

<h3>First Air Defense Day Tomorrow; Implementation of Air Defense Measures; 2,000 Students to Sell Air Defense Badges</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) To promote public understanding of the meaning and importance of air defense and to recognize various air defense measures, the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Air Defense Headquarters has designated the 9th of each month as "Air Defense Day." Tomorrow (the 9th) will be the first Air Defense Day. Various programs, such as citywide air defense exhibitions and air defense exercises, have been prepared.

<h3>Various Organizations to Give Farewell to Minister Zhang Today</h3>

<h3>Minister Hirota Talks about the First Anniversary of China's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Mr. Hirota, Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, gave a speech at the joint press conference of the Army and Navy yesterday (the 7th) on the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. According to the report, the 9th of this month is the first anniversary of China's participation in the war. Japan has been fully cooperating with China during this year, and China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is a valuable expression of China's determination to strike at Anglo-American aggression and to lay the foundation for building a new China. The purpose of the Chinese Revolution is to ensure freedom and independence and to build a new China as a modern nation. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to eliminate Anglo-American forces. Therefore, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States is to achieve the purpose of the revolution. In this sense, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States represents a special effort in the war, establishes China's wartime system, and strives to build China and complete the revolution. The current war is not only China's participation but also a war for Japan and the various nations of Greater East Asia. It can also be said to be a war for the various nations of Greater East Asia. If any one of the nations of East Asia, such as Japan, China, Java, the Philippines, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, and India, is subjected to Anglo-American aggression, the countries of East Asia will not be able to exist and should rise up together to defeat them. This was also mentioned in the Great Asianism written by China's Premier Sun Yat-sen. In addition, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration of December 6 last year also clearly announced that the future of China and the destiny of the various nations of Asia should be closely linked. Therefore, China's declaration of war against Britain and the United States can also be said to be a joint war against Britain and the United States by ten billion people of various Asian nations. Since President Wang of the Chinese National Government showed the Chinese people that they would share weal and woe and live and die together with Japan, I have the utmost respect. In the first year of China's declaration of war, the effect was relatively small due to various reasons in preparation. In the second year, I hope that China's efforts in the war will be even more profound. I firmly believe that the current war will determine the world situation of the coming century. The world after the war will be completely different from the world before the war. Therefore, we deeply hope that those who share in the construction of the new world will strive for victory in this war before undertaking the construction of the new world. This year, 1944, is the decisive year for the world war, which has been clearly stated by both the Axis and Anti-Axis powers. On the occasion of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war, I cannot help but look forward to a great development of the war situation this year.</p>
<h3>New Federation to Hold Commemoration Speech Meeting Tonight; Minister of Justice Zhang to be the Speaker</h3>
<p>(Central News Agency) Since the Allied Japan launched a war to destroy Britain and the United States, the National Government also declared war on January 9 last year, cooperating with each other and fighting together. The power of the common enemies, Britain and the United States, in Asia has gradually diminished, and the liberation of the nations of Greater East Asia is at hand. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, both the government and the people are commemorating it. The Shanghai News Federation has specifically scheduled a "Commemoration and Film Convention Celebrating the First Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War" at the Majestic Theatre on Gordon Road at 7:30 PM today (the 8th). The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, will be invited to be the speaker. The presidium will consist of Yoichi Osako, Xu Liqun, Chen Binhe, Jin Weibai, Huang Jingqi, Yuan Shu, Kyo Moriyama, and Wu Yunzhai. The General Manager of the Convention is Ren Yunpeng. After the speech, the latest Japanese on-the-spot filming of the famous film "Navy" (Chinese name "Angry Seas and Thundering Mines") will be screened to add to the enjoyment.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Coal Dust Transported from North China</h3>
<p>In this city, the supply of coal briquettes has been affected in recent sentences. Due to the decrease in the source of coal dust, there is a shortage of fuel for people's livelihood, and panic is becoming increasingly serious. The black market prices in the city have soared, and unscrupulous merchants have hoarded goods, making the citizens even more anxious. In order to maintain the security of people's livelihood, the city is implementing coal saving measures, restricting electricity, and implementing coal briquette rationing, and is also making great efforts to dredge up sources with relevant parties. Regarding the coal briquette household rationing issue, it has been decided to ration 7 kilograms (14 city pounds) per person per month. The tenth phase of this month will begin on the 12th of this month, so the wood citizens' fuel can be temporarily remedied. It is reported that recently, relevant authorities have made great efforts to purchase coal from the production areas, and have already reached a certain number of achievements. In recent days, a large batch of coal layers have been transported from North China. The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will transport the coal dust and distribute it to 19 coal briquette factories in the city to manufacture coal briquettes.</p>

<p>Short comment</p>
<h3>Understanding the Pain of Travel</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Hongnian, the newly appointed President of China Central Railway Company, hosted various sectors yesterday for greetings after assuming office.</p>
<p>In recent years, transportation issues have been met with considerable dissatisfaction, stemming from poor management, disorder, and the viewing of travel as a painful ordeal. While the China Central Railway Company may strive to cater to public sentiment and seek improvement, these partial remedies offer no benefit to the overall situation and remain far from ideal. The recent re-election of Mr. Hongnian to the presidency is presumably a step towards improvement.</p>
<p>We recognize Mr. Zheng Hongnian as a veteran in the transportation sector, undoubtedly aware of how to manage railways effectively. However, it is crucial that he thoroughly understands the pain and inconvenience faced by ordinary travelers. Improving current transportation problems requires more than just accumulated experience; it demands adaptive methods that closely align with the present situation. To this end, we offer the following three points for Mr. Zheng Hongnian's consideration:</p>
<p>A business-oriented mindset is essential. One must approach railway management with the dedication of running a business to gradually achieve improvements.</p>
<p>You must have the courage of an English actor. After deciding how to improve management methods, you must be resolute and persevere with unwavering courage to succeed.</p>
<p>You must treat the symptoms accordingly. Investigate the actual pain points experienced by travelers, explore the reasons, and implement appropriate countermeasures. Building behind closed doors and partial solutions will never be effective.</p>
<p>Finally, we are aware that the management of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways was optimal and most convenient for travelers 26 years ago, serving as a model for other lines. Naturally, we now hope to see a swift restoration of those conditions.</p>

<h3>Last Night's West Youth Basketball: China United Defeats Allied Forces – Victory Decided in the Final Two Minutes</h3>
<p>West Youth Basketball held two more games last night, marking the first major event since the New Year. In the Group B matches, China Film overwhelmingly defeated Overseas Chinese with a score of 33-16, while Linglong beat Tiantian with a score of 28-15. In the Group A battle, the Amateur team announced a postponement due to incomplete personnel, and Giants and South China played a temporary friendly match. The main event saw China United facing Allied Forces. China United, led by Wu Chengzhang, opened the scoring with great momentum. In the first half, China United took the lead with a score of 11-6. In the second half, China United continued to perform strongly, increasing their score frequently. Unexpectedly, Allied Forces made several long shots and found success, quickly closing the gap to 22-23. At this moment, the atmosphere in the room became increasingly tense. Allied Forces then tied the score at 33 each. Fortunately, in the last two minutes, Qu Kong scored repeatedly, securing three goals, and China United finally won with a score of 36-33. Tonight's schedule is as follows: Zhenyuan vs. Qia Team (B1) at 3:00 PM sharp;   vs. West  (B2) at 4:00 PM sharp.</p>
<h3>Three-Province Track and Field Team Performs in Beijing</h3>
<p>The track and field team of the Three-Province Sports Association, in order to participate in the 5,000-meter cross-country race held in Beijing on the 9th, has organized an expedition team. They are scheduled to take the early train to Beijing this morning at 9:00 AM to attend the performance. They also plan to hold a public city ring run in the capital to promote the sport.</p>
<h3>Today's Group A Football: Overseas Chinese United vs. First Police</h3>
<p>In the football league, starting from 1:30 PM this afternoon, two matches will be held at Changping Road  Zhou Park. In Group B1, United will face the Russian Police, and in Group A, Overseas Chinese United will face the First Police, starting at 3:30 PM, with referee Zhang Le. The two teams are strong contenders from West Overseas Chinese Middle School, and a tense and exciting performance can be anticipated.</p>
<p>The news was dispatched yesterday at 7:20 PM.</p>
<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Official-Civilian Cooperation</h3>
<p>Mayor Chen's response to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiries regarding the city government's measures on the price issue can be described as stern and serious, and the phrase "The wartime price problem is not simple. If we want to thoroughly suppress it, it will be difficult to succeed without official-civilian cooperation" is particularly meaningful. Mayor Chen believes that raising prices not only agitates people's minds and affects society, but is simply an act that harms people's livelihoods and disrupts social order. Therefore, the city government has made its greatest determination to effectively suppress the city's prices this time. Alas, we common people, after hearing this news, it is as if we are longing for rain in a great drought!</p>
<p>However, to be fair, the political and legal regulations that govern society are a kind of invisible machine, so we call administrative organizations agencies; the smooth operation of a machine depends on the soundness of the machine itself, and also on something outside the machine itself, like machine oil, to help it. Assuming that the city government and the material control agency are a machine for suppressing prices, then the people's assistance is like machine oil, which makes it easy to turn, without which it is difficult to move. We feel that there should be at least two kinds of machine oil for suppressing prices: one is the moral behavior of merchants, and the other is the thrifty behavior of citizens. The former requires merchants to put the public interest and welfare of society first, not to have the idea of making huge profits, hoarding major commodities, and raising prices without authorization. The latter requires citizens to pay attention to thrift, not to have wasteful habits, and to regard currency as mud and sand, and waste as broken exhibits; it is necessary to have such a double cooperation, then, the price and material control work can be carried out with half the effort and twice the result, so when we talk about suppressing prices, we always need official-civilian cooperation.</p>
<h3>Materials Control Review Committee Investigates the Production of Various Factories and Supplies Fuel to Factories as Much as Possible</h3>
<p>Recently, the fuel problem in this city has been a concern to all sectors. Most large and small factories have also gradually reduced their production efficiency due to the fuel problem, which has a significant impact on the future of industry and commerce. The Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Review Committee, in view of this, has recently sent investigators to various important factories to conduct detailed investigations. All factories related to people's livelihoods, such as soap and candles, matches, are included in the investigation. The production quantity, inventory, and required fuel of each factory are all investigated in detail. After statistics are compiled, they will discuss with relevant parties and try their best to help supply them to ensure that the production volume of each factory is not reduced due to fuel shortages.</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Materials Control Review Committee held a cadre meeting at the Hamilton Building yesterday afternoon, and appropriate countermeasures were taken on the issues of cotton disposal and suppressing prices.

<p>The Lunar New Year is Approaching, and the Foundation of Chinese Stocks is Still Stable. A Small Number of Stocks Continue to Rise.</p>
<p>Yesterday, most stocks continued to fall, but the foundation stabilized in the afternoon. Due to the downward trend of the previous day, bargain hunters became active, and the rising trend of a small number of stocks did not wane, so the people's hearts changed from tired to stable. Da Zhonghua Matches is still a target for large investors, seeing a high price of 800 yuan, and then slightly falling back. Tonghui Machinery, which has only been on the market for three days, is favored by  users and has flown up to 12 yuan. The closing price was the highest price of the day; Wuhua Weaving in the textile industry rose by 8 yuan, while Wing On Yarn Factory and department stores fell. The decline in the new pharmaceutical industry and cultural stocks was still slight; although the real estate industry rebounded later, it was difficult to reverse the leading trend; Sanle Industrial was firm, and Jiu'an, etc., saw a small squeeze. Financial stocks were uniformly prosperous, with 17,000 yuan for the mainland, 3,000 yuan for Shanghai, 2,700 yuan for Zhejiang Xing, 1,650 yuan for Jin City, and 1,550 yuan for the salt industry, mostly buying prices. Today's closing table is recorded below.</p>
<p>Stock Name   Closing Price</p>
<p>Da Zhonghua Matches 760.00 Tonghui Machinery 54.00 Wuhe Weaving 81.00</p>
<h3>Soap, Candles, and Firewood Prices Soar, Authorities Re-register</h3>
<p>Since the New Year, the prices of various commodities in the city have soared again, especially daily necessities such as soap and matches. Due to the monopoly and hoarding of illegal merchants, the prices have risen sharply. The price of each box of soap, such as Gu Ben and Scissors, has exceeded the three major levels, and the retail price of each piece has reached more than 20 yuan. The rise in the price of matches is even more fierce. The prices of Phoenix and Beauty brands are approaching six levels, and the retail price of each small box is nearly 10 yuan. As for foreign candles, due to the depletion of inventory and the implementation of electricity saving in various places along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway, the prices have risen sharply. It is learned that the authorities in the city, in view of the huge harm to the country and society caused by the soaring prices of daily necessities for the common people, have issued a notice to all soap and candle match retailers and individuals that those who hold inventory should re-register with the competent authority. After this notice was issued, the minds of the general holders softened and they sought to sell. Therefore, yesterday's soap market price turned sharply lower, but the decline in the price of matches and foreign candles was slower.</p>

<h3>Scammed Buying a Woolen Sweater</h3>
<p>The other day, while passing through the intersection of the Great World and Stone Road, I walked in front of a certain store, and there was a person with dirty clothes, about thirty years old, who was holding a woolen sweater in his hand and calling out to buy it. Someone asked him if he could buy it for a certain price, and he said no. At that time, I was also next to him, not  , but he looked back at me, and this person asked me if I wanted to buy it. I did not answer, but after his bitter talk, I answered yes. At that time, I watched him wrap it in newspaper, and then said that the price could not be reduced. I said no, and after walking about two or three steps, he shouted loudly whether to buy this thing or not. At this time, I thought that the price that I had already returned could not be not bought, so I handed over the money. Unexpectedly, after a rickshaw puller told me, I pulled open the newspaper and found that it was a package of vegetables. I regretted it too much. The next day, I went to the place again and saw the person cheating others on the sidewalk again.</p>
