<h3 id="c1">應採取者決予採取應改革者決予改革 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>盟邦日本衆院會議提出必勝决議案，五日全體通過。隨後東條首相起立致詞：「今日實決定皇國興廢與大東亞盛衰之秋，對於增強戰力方面，其實行辦法，政府決不拘於過去所為，應採取者決予採取，應改革者決予改革，以期充分發揚戰時下國民之忠誠。」（二月六日本報）必勝決議案的通過，表示國民的決；東條首相的演詞，表示政府的計劃。國民有決心，政府有計劃，國民和政府是整個的，一億國民的力量是凝固的。把這個偉大的力量，進行大東亞的解放戰，盟邦日本的獲得最後的勝利，是亳無疑義的。</p>
<p>我們謮日本二千六百年來的歷史，如道日本的國民性，最明　的就是有決心，有毅力。從明治維新之后，更充分利用科學方法，積極提倡科學知識。科學精神的主要電，就在有精細的計劃，而從明治維新之後，日本的國民性裏就加上這一點。決心捕難，有精密計劃的決心方才是難能刻貴。有決心，有計劃，這是日本的國民淨勝，這是日本的建國因素。現代國家的與成立，不是一件偶然的事，現代國家的興盛，更不是一件僥倖的事。有這樣的日本國民，有這樣的日本國家。過去的日本和政府今日日木的國家。過去的日本國民和政府已經替日本奠定立國的基石，現在的日本國民和政府，更將用全副精力替未來的日本，未來的大東亞開闢一條康莊大道，</p>
<p>現代戰爭是全體性戰爭，大東亞戰爭更是國力的競賽。我們看到盟邦日本國民的決心，政府的努力，我們不禁替我們自己的中國說聲　愧。參戰已經一年多了，這一年來，我們做了些什麼？在戰時體制下，人民不能够不下決心，努力求戰爭的勝利，絕不容再「徘徊歧途」。可是政府呢？已經有了精密的計劃嗎？那幾件事是已經採取的？那發件事是己經改革的？我們談安定物價已經一年多了，安定物價的成績在那裏？我們談節約已經半年多了，節約的成績在那裹？統制收買棉紗棉布，可算一件大刀闊斧的改革行動，但是，統制收買以後應當怎樣？現在，國民生計史困苦了，社會秩序更不安了，這是個非常時期，我們希望政府要當機立斷，立即採取有效的措施。</p>
<p>戰時措施主要的目的，在求全國一致的團結。國民要決心擁護政府，政府耍立定計劃，謀國民的福利。國民決不能擁護一個無計劃不做事的政府，所以，政府愈拿出淨勝來替老百姓做事，老百姓亦愈拿出決心來擁護。國民與政府，互相表裹，合而為一。戰時措施不比平時，不容有考慮躊躇之餘地。今天應該做的，決不能等到明天。所以我們以為東條首相的演詞，不拘過土所為，應採取者決予採取，應改革者決予改革，實在是戰國政府施政的座右銘，值得大束亞圈裹的國家的注意。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電日大本營七日下午四時發表：一·帝國潛艇曾於二月三日晨在馬紹爾羣島漏賽島附近海面，擊沉敵大型巡洋艦一樓·二·帝國海軍航空部隊及陸海軍守備隊，自二月三日以來，連日邀擊來襲拉巴爾之敵機，　二月三日曾有敵機約二百二十架來襲，當學落其二十六架（內九架未證寶），我機未飛返者一架，　二月四日曾有敵機百四十三架來襲，擊落其十一架（內一架未體實）擊毀三架，我機未飛返者一架。　二月五日曾有敵機一百架來襲，擊落其五十五架（內十二架未證實），擊毀三架，我機未飛返者一架。</p>
<h3 id="c3">馬紹爾羣島作戰與日美戰局限階段　前田海軍中將發表談話 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>南京七日中央社社自敵軍在馬紹爾羣島登陸受挫後，大平洋方面之戰局，漸趨决戰之途，日前田稔海軍中將，曾談馬紹爾作戰與日美戰局之現階段，茲錄談話大意如下：美國自開戰以來，連戰皆北，大東亞要域，已悉為日軍所佔領，美國自昭和十七年下半年始樹立其體制，即於去年中作反攻之準備，首自所羅門羣島，瓜達卡納爾方而開始，其後更向吉爾貝特羣島攻擊，而敵軍反攻之企圖，則已於此次進攻馬紹爾作戰中顯現。羅斯福在木年一月致議會之咨文中，曾謂「本年寶為美國歷史上具有决定性之一年」。關於戰局方面，渠又曾稱：反軸心軍自一九四二年轉守為攻後，則整頓戰備，今可有以海陸空三眾予對方以决定的攻擊態勢，在一九四四年一月，吾人將得到在一戰爭最後階段作攻勞作戰之頭緒云云。又美海軍次官亦曾揚書直接攻擊日木，故可見美軍此次作戰目　，企岡佔領馬紹爾羣島，奪回菲律實，切斷日木本土與內南洋，　斷日對南方補紛及南方對日供給資源之路徑，再進而企岡在日本本土周圍獲得立足點，以實行最後之攻勢、關於馬紹爾島之戰略的重要性，固巳毋待贅言，觀大東亞戰爭之現階段，敵方所採取者，為麥克沃塞自南方進攻，蒙特巴頓自四南進攻，尼米資由中南太平洋方面進攻及自北方　攻等，作包函大東亞之態勢，企岡傾注全力，實行反攻，此以美軍之進攻馬紹爾，亦可認為乃全體反攻之一環，今後無論敵方自所有反攻路綫，同時攻擊東亞，抑作不斷之連續的反攻，總之，為期亦不在遠。目下戰爭狀態極為複雜，如某某方面完全為不統之島嶼，為保存此等島嶼，固應加以補給，倘補給斷絕，即等於該島業已失陷，故補給可謂目下戰爭里點所在，此與飛機之增產同為完送戰爭之要諦，敵方自利用澳洲，紐西蘭為基地，攻擊所羅門，吉爾貝特方面以來，敵之補給路綫，可謂極形不利，而美國物力根本之生產力，亦可謂已至頂點，至於人的問題，則更為美國最大之苦痛，關於資源，雖謂喪失東亞之資源地帶，尚可以科學力量予以補充，但人之量與質，實爲困難問題，美國之生產力確數倍於戰前，美國國民之戰意，將隨今一後反攻態勢之激烈而更趨緊張。實爲必然，但戰爭之優劣，尚須以其量與補給如何而决定。關於馬紹爾方面日方之防衛，已有萬全之準備，自戰略方面與人力方面而觀，東亞之體制安如磐石，美國之力不足，而東亞十億民衆團結一致，實為勝利之基礎。上述敵人之反攻，且將愈益執拗，同時敵方對中國大陸之企圖，亦决未育放過，但中國業已參戰，成為大東亞戰爭中重要之兵站基地、而着着完成其重大任務·旅華日僑亦應適應此戰局之需要，奮然而起，此即日旅華僑應愼重考慮國家目下之要求何在，應積極協力，使中國完全完成其對大東亞戰爭所具之任務，否則對日本戰力及最前綫之戰鬥，皆可謂有直接影饗，此應再加認識者。目下在馬紹爾方面，外珊瑚島上，日軍將土正與敵機敵艦砲擊相　門，吾人對此，誠不勝惑激，至前述之補給基礎，應由後方國民之努力，而實行先自己認識戰爭情努，並應努力使中立人民瞭解，故目下旅華日僑之實務，實極為重大。</p>

<p>東京七日中央社電據南太平洋某基地電，日海軍機隊會於四日轟炸波爾根灣方面敵運輸船團，炸毀共中型運輸船一艘。是日傍晚更強　　諾島敵軍機塲，排除敵戰們機羣之抵抗，大施轟炸，當有二處中彈起火後。又　波根維爾島特羅恭那角敵軍機塲，使其四處起火，繼於五日午夜迄六日拂曉問，再炸摩根島敵軍機塲，當有三處中彈起火，復於六日傍晚猛炸新不列顛島格羅斯　方面敵軍地上部隊及機塲，予以重創後，日機全部安返原防。</p>

<p>蘇黎世七日中央社，美空軍轟炸日本病院船布宜諾斯艾利斯號以來，日政府會屢次向英美抗議，但此種行為仍末停止，萬國紅十字會機關雜誌國際紅十字會評論，會於一蒙受英美軍之不法攻擊，前後達十一次。同時，並要求萬國紅十字會向英美提出嚴重抗議，故萬國紅十字會當將該抗議文通告英美兩國紅十字會，然英國紅十字會竟回答謂：「此等抗議須經利益代表國行之，毫未表示誠意，日紅十字會有鑒於此，乃再行提出強硬抗議，而向萬國紅十字會通告謂：日木政府雖經正當之利益代表國實行抗議，但美英兩軍仍未改悔，且續行不法攻擊，臼政府對此種遼反國際法，罔視人道之不法行為，實不能默視，因此乃行嚴重抗議，日紅十字會當局對此不得不懷最大之關心。再關於去歲十一月十七日美空軍擊沉布宜諾斯埃利斯號一事，日紅十字會對此重大事件，亦不一能不關心，故要請將如此不法轟炸之事實，不僅向一美國，且須通告世界各國紅十字會，萬國紅十字會當將此抗議傳達於美國紅十字會，但美英兩國紅十字會反稱：日軍炸沈病院船尖塔號，並提出抗議，對此日木紅十字會巳於十二月八日答覆，而判明該事實完全無稽。</p>

<p>歐洲戰局愈趨嚴重，柬部戰綫，德蘇兩軍浴血作第三次冬季戰的死鬥。英美單從納吐諾登陸，義大利戰綫愈見活躍，同時，英美更擬在北法或巴爾幹登陸後，在本年中對德决戰。至德國方面，德軍胸有成竹，據歐洲要塞之險，準備邀擊，並待機出擊，以期一舉而殲滅反軸心軍，確保勝利。歐洲戰局正在暴風雨的前夜。趁此緊促的時機，朝日新聞社向海外各地的特派員探詢世界各地動靜，用座談會的形式發表，俾讀者獲悉歐洲戰局的全貌。</p>
<p>敵方的政略戰略</p>
<p>朝日新聞社　歐洲戰局愈趨緊張的理由，當然，在反軸心方面，尤以英美，如其現在不能打倒日德，則日本的大東亞共榮圈，德國的歐洲新秩序，將建設完成，此後永久沒有擊破日德二國的機會。德國從東南漸受包圍的壓迫，在形勢上似漸襄弱，所以英美方面的戰略，擬乘此時收緊包團德國的鐵環，一舉而扣住德國的首部。然與此同時，英美內部的情形，亦波動頗烈。茲希望從布諾斯艾利斯。里斯本。柏林。莫斯科各地獲悉美。英。德。蘇的觀測。</p>
<p>今井特派員（布諾斯艾利斯）美國急於結東歐洲戰局者，有戰略上，政治上二個理由。戰略的理由，第一，如麥克沃塞，格魯等美國負責的指導者們，常對美國人民發出醫吿稱，在美國專顧歐洲的時候，日本開發南方占領地域的莫大資源，並獲得東亞諸民　的支持，而兪趨强大，奠定了不敗的地位。所以美軍的首腦者們都受國、民意識的影響，主張對日戰比對德戰更應注重，故放棄歐洲戰塲，欲以其全部資源傾注於對日戰。但在戰略上，不能如此。因爲他們還相信前次加　勃朗加會談的結論，打倒日本未必能　亡　國。第二個理由，　心歐洲職爭如長此繼續，將削弱英國的戰意、所以美國如領全力於對日戰，則必不能對英國有所帮助。</p>
<p>其次，政治的理由，乃蘇聯的像箭一般催促第二戰綫。　貝克會談後，蘇聯甚至於威　　，英美如不履行第二戰綫的諾言，蘇聯將取自由行動。第二，在本年秋的大選前，如無大的戰果，在羅斯福是非常不利的。那麼，在此前的長時間中，第二戰綫何以遲　未見開關呢？其原因之一，乃因在那維克及狄埃浦試行登陸而失敗的英國，不願再習更大的危險的緣故。</p>
<p>英國苦撑的限度</p>
<p>茂木特派員（里斯本）英國　然想早一點結束戰爭，理由很簡單。英國很知道，在這四年的戰爭中，國民已相富疲勞了。戰爭愈拖長，結果，不過有利於蘇聯與美國而已。國民的疲弊，由於酷烈的勞働員也可想像而知。此在去年達到頂點。從十四歲到六十四歲，所有可能勞働的男女合計二千二百七十萬，六十五歲者也有百萬人，都已經動員了。軍需生產方面，自一九四一年五月手企業準備以來，早已到了最高舉，英國國民的所請漸强，亦自有其限度。</p>
<p>烟中特派員（莫斯科）蘇聯以爲戰爭長期化是不利的。國內的理由，蘇聯在自已的領土內與德軍死鬥了三年，居民　　炭之苦，肥沃的耕地，化爲荒無人烟仍廢墟，工業都市亦已失其機能。這種職禍，在食糧及其他生活必需品方面，造成了國內生活的緊迫。加以德蘇兩軍的反覆演出陣地爭　　，居民的生命，財產每次受到非常的威齊，堅意料不到的困苦。但最重要問題是數百萬兵士在歷史上空前的二千哩之長的戰綫上之　戰。蘇聯的報掌公然强調說，戰爭如拖延一天，多幾千個犧牲者。</p>
<p>蘇聯布　戰爭在短期間結束的國際的理由之一，從　　關，莫斯科兩會談以前，蘇聯報要求英美西歐登陸作戰，提出短期間結束戰爭一事上也可以明瞭。但德黑闌會談後，蘇聯報紙已放棄這問題了。省似乎是因爲在德　　會談上，際於反軸心軍將來的作戰運　上并未達到何等訪解。</p>
<p>蘇聯報上强調說，戰爭的長期化，顯然强化軸心　在佔顀區域的支配，而使易於遂行其戰爭。在政治想想上意見不同，而事前協議戰後的處理問題之反軸心國方面，戰爭的長期化，愈造成英美蘇之間見解參商的時間與機會，所以蘇聯正在勞力勿爲這種機會所乘。</p>
<p>德國破圍出擊</p>
<p>守山特派員（柏林）我以爲戰局的緊張未必祗是反軸心軍方面的理由所致。在這種看法中，並不含有我們的希望的觀測，說敵國陣營步　不一致。英美恐懼蘇聯的得人心，或赤化歐洲，因這政治的理由，而被迫到不能不着手第二戰綫的立塲。這客觀的覜測也可以成立。但那不足以說明一切。英美或　不會因爲面子問題，或人心問題而甘願從事危險的第二戰綫，歐洲戰局的所以緊張，乃因爲兩方均衡的軍事力，現在德方頗見不利，反軸心方面如再加緊進攻，德國就要投降　。現在反德陣營方面所見的。是蘇聯軍在東部戰綫之驚異的進出，義大利的退出，及英美空軍之對德迎續轟炸。但另一方面，德國也有使戰局緊張的理由。在東方蘇聯軍用意料之外的力量來加以　迫。在西方，英美軍二百萬伺機在歐洲大陸登陸。更不能放心的是巴爾幹及挪威占領區，及同盟諸國不能任意指揮的　墜，所以德國的立塲頗爲困苦。不能集中大兵力在一個决戰塲所。</p>
<p>說到英美空軍之有組織的恐怖轟炸，德國空軍已徐徐抬起頭來了。假定今後一月間、同樣的恐怖轟炸仍繼續，則德國國　之源泉的各都市，將變成何種狀況呢？在這種情勢下，純取防禦戰，遷延　日等於坐以待死。防禦戰快到限界了。</p>
<p>希特勒亦常說到這事情。在新春的告國民書中說：「今年是　回攻　主　權之年。」從德國方面看來，不能不突破重圍出擊。這樣，戰局的　張，在兩方面均有其所以然，歐洲戰爭　踏入了制目相視的重大階段。</p>
<h3 id="c26">東部戰綫 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>朝日社决定戰局者是武力戰。從此點說米，現在戰鬥最激烈，並决定將來戰局之歸趨的東戰綫情形，並今後的動向如何？</p>
<p>烟中去年夏以來，東部戰綫不斷激戰。此期間戰鬥的特色是德軍取守勢。紅軍在三區城三分德單兵力，使取守勢，即企圖將德軍兵力三分於軍部戰綫，地中海戰緩，及大西洋岸的第二戰綫。紅軍蹈德軍之處，在南部地區前進頗多，在中央地區已達白俄，去夏以來呈膠着狀態的北部地區則傾其主力。</p>
<p>守山　東部戰綫的歸趨與巴陀里奧的投降，動搖了德國作戰計劃的根本。去夏以來的德軍，僅以必要兵力在某點上阻止蘇聯軍的攻擊，而以其新的精銳部隊及補充兵力的大軍配置於西方及南方戰綫。因而有去年從哈科夫到某　的四百公里大撤退。那麽，德軍之有計劃的撤退，到何處爲止呢？最後防綫在那裏呢？從特尼泊爾河彎曲部的孟許坦因軍之死守該綫，約可窺知。</p>
<p>於是蘇軍乃從十四日起突然移其攻擊的中心於北部的列　格勒及伊爾門湖附近。對於這蘇聯軍的戰術，德軍不能忽視。</p>
<p>渡邊特派員（瑞典京城）從中立國方面看，的冬季攻勢似達頂　。蘇聯能够使用於第一綫的兵力。已很有限，已動員了一九二七年出生的少年。德軍爲應付第二戰綫，在節約兵力的意義上繼續後退，於必要時，將後退至烏克闌戰綫的波格河，這在未到冬季之前已經决定了。</p>
<p>德軍在東部戰綫的防衛綫，並不像齋格菲或馬奇諾防綫一樣祗有一條，乃是有許多防衛綫而當於融通性的防衛綫，不易突破。</p>
<p>田口特派員（沮利希）東部戰綫的要點依然是南部戰錢。現在的主要戰鬥展開於布格河上流區域、此方面的戰門，在巴爾幹的軍事政治情勢上，有極大影響，最須注目。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞以　在現階段紅軍與其以高價對　　直接進攻，不如代以全面的攻擊。　　軍能否突破一九三九年的德蘇國境綫的問題，要在布　河上流的戰局發　後始能得到回答（翔：獨自二男一日西部戰日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="c49">關鍵在什麼地方？ <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>戰時的經濟復興，言今年的農工增產，其關鍵所在自通常的說法，無非是解決原料缺乏，動力限制，以及工人食糧問題種種。我們固也承認這些困難的解救，確為增加生產的先決條件，可是，還有兩個最先決條件。形成增產年中的主要關鍵，為我們所萬不能熱視無睹的，那就是：　協衝力的保持，　投機心理的肅淸。以醫理作比喻的話，勞慟力的保持，就等於以培補血液為增加體量的先決條件：投機心理的肅淸，就等於以去腐為生新的先決條件。</p>
<p>說到勞慟力的保持，我們極表同情於最近國府教育部所提倡的勞作，增產運動，使各地中小學利用學校塲園及附近隙地，聯合全校師生從事墾荒工作，此外，如促使「單帮客一之還鄉歸田，無業游民之參加工廠勞作，都是保持勞慟力的辦法。說到投機心理的肅淸，我們極表同情於吉田東祐先生前天本報星期評論中，和廣瀨庫太郎先生在昨天新申報星期論文中所說的話，他們兩位認定今日的中國經濟病態，完全在於投機行為的猖獗；一位比它作肺病，一位比它作癌，不下央心去治療。那是要不可救藥的。所以，投機心理的肅淸，實在又是關鍵中的關鍵所在。</p>

<p>— 岩田雄著洪羊譯</p>
<p>三月二十五日午前五時許，眞人穿着破舊的二中制服，抱着比到學校去時還大一點兒的包袱，進了西鹿兒島站三等候車室。哥哥四吉同太郞護着母親，坐在長橈上。四月一日就是江田島海軍兵學校人學的日子，在眞人的衣袋裏　着「豫定錄取學生到校須知」的小冊子。</p>
<p>「沒甚麼可說的，要保重身體，發憤用功。」母親在這種時候，不過同一般做母親的所要說的話以外，甚麼也沒談及。但是這幾句普通話，傎人却深深地感動了。</p>
<p>在這個時候，隆夫同他妹妹枝子也趕到了。</p>
<p>「這倒　為你了……不來也可以，昨天晚上巳經說過……」</p>
<p>眞人故意大擊地說着·前夜在隆夫家會為眞人開過送別會。氣人說的話也沒在意的細聽隆夫便說道：</p>
<p>「別忘了來信！」漾溢着友誼的聲音。</p>
<p>枝子不知道是甚麼緣故，却揚眉不　裝着沒事兒似地。</p>
<p>「呀！恭喜。　時候，大原先生同緒方先生帶着軍人班主要的學生們，到候事窒來了。校長先生以下各位先生，雖然前幾天都去辭過行，但是都親自到車站來送行，這實在是過意不去、先生和學友們都在說送　人在七時三十五分開車後，就回到學校，還可以趕得上開課的時間，於是眞人也放心了。</p>
<p>「實在太謝謝了。」母親·哥哥們都誠意地道謝。不久就到軋栗的時間了。無諭怎樣辭謝着，先生們一定要送上火車。</p>
<p>從鹿兒島老站出發的慢車、蜿蜓地進站來了。眞人向先生們鄭重地致過謝辭後，進了後尾的三等車中去了。因爲有五分鐘的停車時間，眞人從窗口探出身子，和朋友們談着·</p>
<p>「暑假不要忘了，一定要回來！」雖然不是軍人班的，也來送行的谷與平這樣的說着。</p>
<p>「哼……我們還在天保山海濱游水哩！」眞人嬉嬉地笑着。因爲這是一個榮譽的啓程，所以他的笑顏，也比平時更見得軒昂。</p>
<p>終於開車前的鈴聲嚮了。</p>
<p>隆夫好像不耐煩似地靠到窗邊兒上的時候，枝子跑到了面前張開了口，「自己一個人，人了海軍、眞得意啊！……」</p>
<p>好像閃電似的一語，同時開車的汽笛也響了</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>因爲在菊池少佐領率之下，會來過一次的道路，所以眞人可以不必要慌忙無措了。但是在下關等候換車時的無聊，他又不由地想起了枝了所說的話，和校子這女孩子的爲人。</p>
<p>（一個小姑娘，好大的膽量！那樣的女子，從來沒見過。好像深深地在憎惡着我似的：）眞人對那理由，總也猜不到，無論她爲共麼在恨着他。但他終不能對這起反悠。終於感到這眞是一個有趣的女子，不禁要笑出來……</p>
<p>車到了吳市·天還沒亮，買來飯盒子、在候車空吃了早飯後，循着迫　的道路，走到川原石碼頭。那時巳經將枝子的事情忘到腦梭去了。乘着第一趟的定期船，渡到了江田島。春天的瀨戶內海，和夏天不同，浮泛着美麗的色彩。突然注意的一看，在船裏有好像自己同志似的人們帶着大包袱和篷布皮包，凝視着军艦的形　。</p>
<p>到了小川，有公共汽車在等着。但是眞人却記得前年來的時候，是徒步走去的。道路也修理得很好。</p>
<p>好像高千穗山峰縮影的小山·在道路的右邊聳立着。那便是有名的古鷹山，眞人在前年來參觀的時候，已經知道了。晚開的椿樹花和桃花，到處都盛開必着。</p>
<p>（朝夕眺望着古鷹山，要有說不盡的美觀……）</p>
<p>他忽然慄然地感到了不安。因爲他還不是江田島村民所呼着的『學生君』。不過是一個預定錄取的學生。在入學以前，還要經過嚴密的體格檢查，並凡聽到在這回的體格檢查，最多的時候有入個人被取消了入學資格。</p>

<h3 id="c61">徵收戰時股票交易利得稅建言 <a href="#c61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— 倪孝同</p>
<p>一年來，滬地生產事業，殊爲蓬勃！言其表，可說在戰時，更是在總力决戰年之良好現象；益以經營者之不斷增資，更示生產事業之樂艱。由是，各種股票，充斥於市，當局爲防止非法投機者之作祟，會頒佈法令，審定得以自由賣買之股票若干種，以示限制，計固得焉。言其實，則目今股票市塲中，却產生下列之反常現象。</p>
<p>業經審定股票之流通額，反較先前未經審定時之全部股額，有增無滅。　每日成交之數額，倍於往昔。　從事於股票賣買者，業外人倍於業中人。　試觀各種生產事業·在經審定得以發行股票·以及增資後之生產現狀如何？敢曰多數一仍其舊；祇增佔其資產之値而已。因是·生產力與資財，未達合理之正比例。</p>
<p>有上述現象，其因何在？敢曰：　當局導游資人正途之力不足。　經營事業者爲迎合投資者之心理，不惜巧立動人聽聞之名目，發行股票，以待投資者之善沽。　投資者惑於牟利迅速，手續簡易，益存有「此時不發財，將待何時」之心理、故亦不惜傾全力一投機焉。　在上者對政令令而不多問；在下者對政令奉而不力行；爲民者旣乏愛國觀念、抑且誤解某種政令之推行，乃屬少數當專者之「生財之道一而已。故不惜利用種種手段，從事賄賂。以遂牟利願欲。有此因果，一個國家，更是在戰時，難求經濟政策之全面　滑推進。</p>
<p>按世界各國，在對外發生戰爭行爲時，多頒佈法律，徵收戰時利得稅。此誠爲限制非法暴利之良策。今吾國旣與盟邦共負創設大東亞新秩序之重任，則在後方之經濟建設，不容遲延。欲求經濟建設之完美期成，則徵稅當屬不可免之一途。今以個人之立塲，設想對股票之賣買，徵以利得稅後之效果爲何？</p>
<p>能使一切生產事業之虛實，得以測騐出之。</p>
<p>能便富有者認識對國家更是在戰時，有更多納稅之義務。　能使人民旣覺專事非法牟利之不當，則必從事節約，不隨意浪費。人人能抱定能省則省之宗旨，則囤積居奇者何由作崇？一切物價何來刺激而暴漲？且更以使上下人等認淸從事正當事業，旣能利己又可利人；間接間對國家之戰時經濟政策，且大有輔助焉。</p>
<p>於此，吾人敢曰，目今物價騰漲，生活非易，其因固屬多端。徹底斷言之，各色人等之「乘火打劫」，「非法牟利」之心理，實有以促成之。財之來也旣易且鉅，於是窮奢極侈；金盡矣，則必殫其心計，求獲倍利之道。求利厚，事簡，時速，唯出於目今大衆風尙所趨之股票　買之一途耳。旣獲利矣，則又復極盡奢樂之能事。如此往復循環，人人效尤；正當事業，乏人顧問、生產力遂日就衰落！然則物價安不受刺激而暴漲？發生何由安定？統制經濟政策，何從完成？</p>
<p>故吾人將大聲疾呼曰：爲求「增產」之能切實做到？爲求正當生產事業之能日益發展；為求有危人民生計之非法投機，使之銷聲斂跡；爲使人民了解戰時節約儲蓄之重耍，以渡未來更困重之難關；則當局對此大衆所趨之變相性之投機事業，股票賣買，應課以戰時利得重稅！（移酬助學）</p>

<h3 id="e1">To Take What Should Be Taken, To Reform What Should Be Reformed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Allied Nation Japan's House of Representatives presented a resolution for certain victory, which was unanimously passed on the 5th. Subsequently, Prime Minister Tojo stood up and delivered a speech: "Today is truly the autumn to determine the rise and fall of the Empire and the prosperity and decline of Greater East Asia. Regarding enhancing combat power, in its implementation, the government will not be bound by past practices, but will take what should be taken and reform what should be reformed, to fully promote the loyalty of the people in wartime." (February 6th, This Newspaper) The passage of the resolution for certain victory represents the determination of the people; Prime Minister Tojo's speech represents the government's plan. The people have determination, the government has a plan, the people and the government are a whole, and the power of 100 million people is solidified. Using this great power to carry out the liberation war of Greater East Asia, there is no doubt that the Allied Nation Japan will achieve final victory.</p>
<p>When we read Japan's 2,600-year history, and understand the Japanese national character, the most obvious thing is determination and perseverance. Since the Meiji Restoration, they have made full use of scientific methods and actively promoted scientific knowledge. The main point of the scientific spirit lies in having detailed plans, and this point was added to the Japanese national character after the Meiji Restoration. A determination to overcome difficulties, a determination with meticulous planning, is truly precious and admirable. Having determination and having plans, this is the Japanese national spirit, this is the building factor of Japan. The establishment of a modern country is not an accidental event, and the prosperity of a modern country is even less a matter of luck. There are such Japanese people, there is such a Japanese country. The past Japanese people and government have already laid the cornerstone for the establishment of Japan, and the current Japanese people and government will use all their energy to open up a broad road for the future of Japan and the future of Greater East Asia.</p>
<p>Modern warfare is total war, and the Greater East Asia War is even more a contest of national strength. Seeing the determination of the people of the Allied Nation Japan and the efforts of the government, we cannot help but feel ashamed for our own China. It has been more than a year since we joined the war. What have we done in this year? Under the wartime system, the people must be determined to strive for victory in the war, and must not "hesitate again on a diverging road." But what about the government? Does it already have detailed plans? What things have already been taken? What things have already been reformed? We have been talking about stabilizing prices for more than a year. Where is the success of stabilizing prices? We have been talking about thrift for more than half a year. Where is the success of thrift? The unified purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth can be considered a major and decisive reform action, but what should happen after the unified purchase? Now, the people's livelihood is extremely difficult, and social order is even more unstable. This is a very critical period, and we hope that the government will make decisive decisions and immediately take effective measures.</p>
<p>The main purpose of wartime measures is to seek national unity. The people must be determined to support the government, and the government must establish plans to seek the welfare of the people. The people can never support a government that has no plans and does nothing. Therefore, the more the government shows its ability to do things for the people, the more the people will show their determination to support it. The people and the government are mutually supportive and united as one. Wartime measures are different from peacetime and do not allow for consideration or hesitation. What should be done today must not be put off until tomorrow. Therefore, we believe that Prime Minister Tojo's speech, not being bound by past practices, taking what should be taken, and reforming what should be reformed, is truly the motto for the administration of a wartime government and deserves the attention of countries within the Greater East Asia sphere.</p>

<h3 id="e3">Marshall Islands Operations and the Current Phase of the Japan-U.S. War Situation; Vice Admiral Maeda Announces Statement <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) Since the enemy forces' landing attempt in the Marshall Islands was thwarted, the war situation in the Pacific has gradually moved towards a decisive battle. Vice Admiral Minoru Maeda recently discussed the current phase of the Marshall Islands operations and the Japan-U.S. war situation. The main points of the statement are recorded below: Since the beginning of the war, the United States has suffered successive defeats. The important areas of Greater East Asia have all been occupied by the Japanese army. The United States began to establish its system in the second half of Showa 17 (1942), and prepared for a counterattack in the middle of last year, starting from the Solomon Islands and Guadalcanal. Later, they attacked the Gilbert Islands, and the enemy's attempt to counterattack has been revealed in this attack on the Marshall Islands. In his address to Congress in January of this year, Roosevelt said that "this year will be a decisive year in American history." Regarding the war situation, he also stated: After the anti-Axis forces switched from defense to offense in 1942, they reorganized their war preparations and can now launch a decisive attack on the enemy with their naval, land, and air forces. In January 1944, we will have the first clues to conducting offensive operations in the final stage of the war. Furthermore, the Undersecretary of the U.S. Navy has also publicly stated that they will directly attack Japan. Therefore, it can be seen that the goal of the U.S. military in this operation is to occupy the Marshall Islands, recapture the Philippines, cut off the link between the Japanese mainland and the Inner South Seas, cut off the supply of materials from the South to Japan and the supply of resources from the South to Japan, and then attempt to gain a foothold around the Japanese mainland to carry out the final offensive. The strategic importance of the Marshall Islands is self-evident. Observing the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the enemy is adopting a strategy of MacArthur attacking from the South, Mountbatten attacking from Southeast Asia, Nimitz attacking from the Central and South Pacific, and attacking from the North, forming a posture of encircling Greater East Asia, attempting to pour all their strength into launching a counterattack. Therefore, the U.S. attack on the Marshall Islands can also be considered a part of the overall counterattack. In the future, whether the enemy launches simultaneous attacks on East Asia from all counterattack routes or conducts continuous counterattacks, the timing will not be far off. The current state of war is extremely complex. If certain areas are completely isolated islands, they should be supplied to preserve them. If the supply is cut off, it is equivalent to the island being lost. Therefore, supply can be said to be the key point in the current war. This, along with increasing the production of aircraft, is the key to completing the war. Since the enemy used Australia and New Zealand as bases to attack the Solomon Islands and Gilbert Islands, the enemy's supply lines can be said to be extremely unfavorable. And the fundamental productivity of the United States can be said to have reached its peak. As for the problem of people, it is the biggest pain for the United States. Regarding resources, although it is said that the loss of resource areas in East Asia can be supplemented by scientific power, the quantity and quality of people are indeed difficult problems. The productivity of the United States is indeed several times greater than before the war, and the American people's will to fight will inevitably become more tense with the intensification of the counteroffensive posture. However, the advantages and disadvantages of war still need to be determined by the amount and how the supplies are. Regarding the Japanese defense in the Marshall Islands, complete preparations have been made. From a strategic and manpower perspective, the system of East Asia is as solid as a rock, the strength of the United States is insufficient, and the unity of 1 billion people in East Asia is the foundation of victory. The aforementioned enemy counterattacks will become more and more stubborn, and at the same time, the enemy's attempts on the Chinese mainland will never be abandoned. However, China has already joined the war and become an important base for the Greater East Asia War, steadily completing its important tasks. Japanese expatriates in China should also adapt to the needs of this war situation and rise up vigorously. That is, Japanese expatriates in China should carefully consider what the country's current requirements are and actively cooperate to enable China to fully complete its tasks in the Greater East Asia War, otherwise it can be said to have a direct impact on Japan's combat power and the front-line battles, which should be further recognized. Currently, on the outer coral islands of the Marshall Islands, Japanese soldiers are fighting fiercely with enemy aircraft and ship shelling. We are sincerely inspired by this. As for the aforementioned supply base, it should be realized by the efforts of the people in the rear, and first recognize the war situation, and should also work hard to make neutral people understand. Therefore, the practical affairs of Japanese expatriates in China are extremely important.</p>

<p>Zurich, 7th (Central News Agency) Since the U.S. Air Force bombed the Japanese hospital ship Buenos Aires, the Japanese government has repeatedly protested to Britain and the United States, but this type of behavior has not stopped. The International Red Cross Review, a magazine of the International Red Cross organization, has suffered 11 illegal attacks by British and American forces. At the same time, it requested the International Red Cross to lodge a serious protest with Britain and the United States. Therefore, the International Red Cross notified the Red Cross Societies of Britain and the United States of the protest. However, the British Red Cross replied, "Such protests must be carried out through the protecting power," showing no sincerity. In view of this, the Japanese Red Cross Society lodged a strong protest again and notified the International Red Cross, saying: Although the Japanese government has protested through the proper protecting power, the U.S. and British forces have not repented and continue to carry out illegal attacks. The Japanese government cannot remain silent on this illegal behavior that violates international law and disregards humanity. Therefore, a serious protest is lodged, and the Japanese Red Cross authorities cannot but have the greatest concern about this. Regarding the sinking of the Buenos Aires by the U.S. Air Force on November 17th last year, the Japanese Red Cross Society cannot but be concerned about this major incident. Therefore, it requests that the facts of such illegal bombing be notified not only to the United States, but also to the Red Cross Societies of all countries in the world. The International Red Cross transmitted this protest to the American Red Cross Society, but the Red Cross Societies of Britain and the United States claimed that the Japanese army had sunk the hospital ship Sarpedon and lodged a protest. The Japanese Red Cross Society replied on December 8th, and determined that the facts were completely unfounded.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:20 PM on the 7th: In Burma, the Japanese army, having previously observed that the British and Indian armies were attempting to counterattack on the Buthidaung and Hin-Ke front, launched a daring offensive on February 4th from the Buthidaung front in a preemptive strike. The Indian National Army is also assisting various units of the Japanese army and is currently engaged in combat. The progress of the war is proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A Japanese forward base in Burma reports: After the Japanese army in Burma started attacking from the east bank of the Mayu River, it further expanded its gains east of the Mayu Mountains on the 4th. The enemy forces on the Buthidaung front began to waver after the Japanese army launched a general offensive, and appeared to be retreating. At the same time, Japanese aircraft, in support of the ground troops, also launched a large-scale attack on the afternoon of the 4th, fiercely bombing enemy positions in various places and heavily damaging enemy artillery and concentrated troops. In addition, they engaged eight enemy fighters that came to intercept them, shooting down three of them. On the 5th, they fiercely bombed the enemy army on the road west of Maungdaw, and the bombs hit enemy concentrations, and also assisted ground troops in disrupting the enemy's retreat route.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) According to a Japanese forward base in Burma, in the Hukawng Valley area on the Indo-Burmese border, the enemy had previously invaded a Japanese position northwest of Taipha Ga on the 29th of last month with a force of approximately 500 men. After the Japanese army intercepted them, they left six corpses and retreated in defeat. At the same time, the Japanese army received information that the enemy was advancing with mortar artillery at a location 23 miles northeast of Taipha Ga. They launched a preemptive strike, ambushing the enemy and repelling them, inflicting heavy damage. On the 2nd, approximately 120 enemy troops again attempted to attack Taipha Ga, and the Japanese army immediately intercepted them. The enemy could not withstand the attack and retreated in defeat, leaving nine corpses behind.</p>

They encountered 20 enemy jet aircraft. But without fighting, the enemy aircraft fled, so the Japanese aircraft immediately pursued and shot down one of them. Afterwards, one enemy plane that fled, because of flying too low, crashed into the trees and immediately caught fire and fell to the ground. Afterwards, a Japanese warship approached the enemy's first airspace, and although the ground enemy artillery fired fiercely, the Japanese aircraft bravely swooped down and violently attacked the enemy's anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine gun positions.

<h3 id="e12">Subhas Chandra Bose Issues Statement Pledging to Fulfill Oath to Liberate Homeland <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) A Japanese base in Burma reports that the Indian National Army is now closely cooperating with the Japanese army, and is active on the Arakan front to liberate their homeland. Subhas Chandra Bose, president of the Provisional Government of Free India, has issued a statement in the name of the Supreme Commander of the Indian National Army, saying in essence: The Indian National Army has been established for several months, during which time the enemy has tried its best to propagate to the Indian people, especially the British Indian army, that the Indian National Army has no real strength. But since the Indian Agency began broadcasting in December of last year, the enemy's propaganda has fallen into a state of anxiety and embarrassment. They have also adopted new propaganda tactics, previously spreading rumors to the world that I would publicly end the Indian National Army by the end of 1943 and arrive in Germany, and repeatedly fabricated claims that I failed to fulfill my promise to reach Germany in 1943. This new propaganda aimed at attacking me is intended to conceal the fact that Mountbatten failed to launch a counterattack in Burma as scheduled. In fact, I have never made any statement, but I will fulfill all promises that I have made to my compatriots. I have also replied to my compatriots that I will realize what I have said once the opportunity arrives. In the past, we started to act according to a predetermined plan, gradually moving towards the road to success. But the allocation of time was delayed. When the Provisional Government of Free India and the Supreme Command of the National Army moved from Shonan to Burma in early January, there was nervousness and panic in Delhi. The British Indian army immediately adopted new measures to cover up its failures. Although they try to conceal the existence of the Indian National Army, they slander me personally and the army I lead, and they claim that the Indian National Army will not be able to advance in the direction they indicated. It is difficult to explain the future activities of the National Army at this stage, but we will answer it with facts. I hereby solemnly declare that the time has come for us to act according to the established plan, and we will now fulfill our oath to liberate our homeland. With unwavering confidence, we are full of hope for final victory, and we are determined to overcome all difficulties and continue to advance until the Indian flag, which is now flying in Arakan, is firmly established on the roof of the British Governor-General's mansion in Delhi.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The newly appointed advisor to the National Government's National Economic Council, Dr. Nasu Hakaru, is a renowned expert in agricultural economics from Japan. He possesses a deep understanding of Chinese agriculture. Dr. Nasu previously served as a professor at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and as an honorary professor at Peking University Medical College in China for many years. His current appointment as an advisor to the National Government's National Economic Council, to assist the government's production increase efforts, comes at a time of the Greater East Asia decisive battle, and is met with the utmost expectation from all levels of our government and society. Mr. Nasu arrived in Shanghai on the 5th and came to Nanjing on the 6th. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit yesterday and was honored to hear his aspirations, which are summarized as follows: "Due to the war, China's overseas transportation is obstructed, and the source of supplies is lacking, leading to unprecedented inflation. Upon my arrival here, I have witnessed the difficult situation of the Chinese people's livelihood, which has deeply moved me. On New Year's Day this year, Chairman Wang announced the three major administrative policies for this year: 1. Increase production, 2. Rectify thought, and 3. Ensure public security. From this, we can see the National Government's determination to stabilize people's livelihood and cultivate combat power. I am honored to be appointed by your esteemed government, and in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, I will strive to increase production. Regarding the issue of agricultural technical talents, China currently seems to lack them. In the future, more agricultural vocational schools, demonstration farms, agricultural research institutes, and agricultural short-term training classes can be established. Furthermore, the farmers should be instilled with awareness of the current situation, so that they will voluntarily devote themselves to increasing production. In addition, strengthening agricultural administrative institutions is also very important," and so on.</p>

<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the German News Agency, German military authorities announced: "The enemy bridgehead in Nettuno, Italy, has been relatively quiet recently. German artillery bombarded enemy strongholds, with visible effect. The German air force attacked the enemy landing site in Anzio the night before last, severely damaging an enemy destroyer and two medium-sized transport ships."</p>
<p>British Forces Encircles and Annihilated in Aprilia Front</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Havas Agency: "A unit of British troops was encircled in Aprilia and completely eliminated within twenty-four hours. Prisoners of war are arriving in a steady stream, and by Saturday evening, 900 British prisoners of war had gathered at the assembly point, awaiting interrogation. The captured war trophies have not yet been counted and German troops are now busy collecting them. German armored grenadiers and paratroopers immediately occupied the newly recovered positions. The new eastern front is now located south of Aprilia. Although the scale of the Aprilia battle cannot be compared to the eastern front, the loss of a British battalion in the Nettuno landing operation is more severe than the annihilation of several Soviet divisions on the eastern front. In the Aprilia encirclement, in addition to the loss of a large number of prisoners of war, no less than 500 officers and soldiers were killed, which shows that advancing on Rome is no easy task."</p>

<p>Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to the Shanghai News Agency: "The current situation on the Eastern Front is most remarkable for its changing climate. According to reports from the battlefields near Kirovograd and Belaya Tserkov, the ground there is thawing and the 'spring muddy season' has begun, about six to eight weeks earlier than usual.

<p>Geneva, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Washington correspondent for The New York Times claims: "British and American policies will soon undergo changes, one being closer cooperation with the French Committee of National Liberation, the second a better understanding of the unpopularity of the Italian King and Prince, and the third being constant pressure on the Franco government."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch: "The US government is now preparing to develop West Asian oil fields. Interior Secretary and President of the Petroleum Reserves Corporation, Ickes, recently stated that the US government has signed an agreement with two oil companies established with American capital in Arabia to develop Arabian oil. The contents of the agreement are as follows: 1. Invest 130 million US dollars to lay a pipeline from the Arabian oilfield area to the Mediterranean coast. 2. Oil will be supplied to the US Army and Navy," etc. This agreement must be approved by the King of Saudi Arabia and the relevant authorities of other related countries before it can take effect. Britain believes that this move by the United States is clearly an attempt to dominate extensive oil rights in West Asia, and undoubtedly to expand its political influence, and therefore feels deeply uneasy.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - "The Voz" newspaper declared yesterday: "Of all the psychological warfare waged by the anti-Axis powers, none has been as intense and persistent as that waged against Spain. Under the leadership of General Franco, Spain has removed all the undesirable elements, and these elements are now seeking to retaliate against the new Spain. Proof of this attack is the anti-Spanish propaganda carried out by London radio, and the asylum granted to the former Communist government official, Silva, in North Africa, is also an anti-Spanish action. In view of these measures, the Spanish government's declaration of neutrality is extremely welcome. The Spanish government will resolutely resist any pressure from organizations of Spanish people or foreigners, or pressure to force Spain to abandon its neutrality, for the sake of neutrality."</p>
<p>Madrid, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Spanish government's mouthpiece, "Arriba" newspaper, published an article yesterday entitled "Spanish Neutrality and Communism," stating, "We will never allow communism to operate in Spain. The current existence of the Spanish government is the result of the people and their will. Spain regards itself as a protector of culture and religion, and therefore must hold a clear position against international communism. If the Soviet Union can implement the principles of communism within its own borders, but exports it to Catholic countries, it must be condemned."</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Defense of European Fortress - Roundtable Discussion by Asahi Shimbun Correspondents from Overseas <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The European war situation is becoming increasingly serious. On the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet armies are engaged in a bloody death struggle in the third winter war. The British and Americans landed at Nettuno, and the Italian front is becoming increasingly active. At the same time, the British and Americans are planning to land in northern France or the Balkans and then launch a decisive battle against Germany this year. On the German side, the German army is confident and, relying on the dangers of the European fortress, is preparing to intercept the enemy and wait for an opportunity to attack, in the hope of annihilating the anti-Axis forces in one fell swoop and securing victory. The European war situation is on the eve of a storm. Taking advantage of this urgent moment, the Asahi Shimbun asked its overseas correspondents about the movements around the world, and published them in the form of a roundtable discussion, so that readers can get a complete picture of the European war situation.</p>
<p>Enemy's Political and Military Strategy</p>
<p>Asahi Shimbun: The reason why the European war situation is becoming increasingly tense is, of course, that the anti-Axis powers, especially Britain and the United States, believe that if they cannot defeat Japan and Germany now, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere of Japan and the New European Order of Germany will be established, and there will be no opportunity to defeat Japan and Germany in the future. Germany is gradually being surrounded and suppressed from the southeast, and its situation seems to be gradually weakening, so the strategy of the British and American sides is to take this opportunity to tighten the iron ring surrounding Germany and seize the head of Germany in one fell swoop. However, at the same time, the situation within Britain and the United States is also fluctuating greatly. Now, we hope to learn about the observations of the US, Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union from Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Berlin, and Moscow.</p>
<p>Imai Correspondent (Buenos Aires): The United States is eager to end the European war for two reasons: strategic and political. The strategic reason is, first, that American leaders in charge, such as MacWorsey and Gru, often issue medical reports to the American people, saying that while the United States is focusing on Europe, Japan is developing the vast resources of the southern occupied territories and gaining the support of the East Asian people, and is becoming increasingly powerful, laying the foundation for an invincible position. Therefore, the heads of the American military are all influenced by national consciousness and advocate that the war against Japan should be given more attention than the war against Germany, so they want to abandon the European theater and devote all their resources to the war against Japan. But strategically, this cannot be done. Because they still believe in the conclusion of the previous Casablanca meeting, that defeating Japan may not be able to subjugate Germany. The second reason is that they fear that if the European war continues like this, it will weaken Britain's will to fight, so if the United States devotes all its strength to the war against Japan, it will not be able to help Britain.</p>
<p>Secondly, the political reason is that the Soviet Union is urging the opening of a second front like an arrow. After the Becker talks, the Soviet Union even threatened that if Britain and the United States did not fulfill their promise of a second front, the Soviet Union would take free action. Secondly, without a major victory before the election in the fall of this year, it will be very unfavorable to Roosevelt. So, why has the second front been delayed for so long before this? One of the reasons is that Britain, which failed in its attempts to land at Narvik and Dieppe, is unwilling to take on greater risks.</p>
<p>The Limit of British Endurance</p>
<p>Mogi Correspondent (Lisbon): Britain naturally wants to end the war as soon as possible, and the reason is very simple. Britain knows very well that the people have become quite tired in these four years of war. The longer the war drags on, the more it will only benefit the Soviet Union and the United States. The people's exhaustion, due to the harsh labor, can also be imagined. This reached its peak last year. From the age of fourteen to sixty-four, all possible working men and women totaled 22.7 million, and there were also a million people over the age of sixty-five, who have all been mobilized. In terms of munitions production, it has long reached its peak since the start of enterprise preparation in May 1941. The demands of the British people are gradually increasing, and there is a limit to their endurance.</p>
<p>Kemuri Correspondent (Moscow): The Soviet Union believes that the prolongation of the war is unfavorable. The domestic reason is that the Soviet Union has been fighting to the death with the German army in its own territory for three years, and the residents have suffered the hardship of burning charcoal. The fertile farmland has been turned into desolate and uninhabited ruins, and the industrial cities have also lost their function. This misfortune has created a domestic life crisis in terms of food and other necessities of life. In addition, the repeated performances of the German and Soviet armies in the battle for positions have caused the residents' lives and property to be subject to extraordinary pressure and unimaginable hardship. But the most important problem is the battle of millions of soldiers on the historically unprecedented 2,000-mile-long front. The Soviet newspapers openly emphasize that if the war is delayed for one day, there will be thousands more victims.</p>
<p>One of the international reasons why the Soviet Union wants the war to end in a short period of time is clear from the Moscow talks. Before the Moscow talks, the Soviet newspapers requested that Britain and the United States launch a landing operation in Western Europe, and proposed that the war be ended in a short period of time. But after the Tehran talks, the Soviet newspapers abandoned this issue. It seems that because no solution was reached on the future operational movements of the anti-Axis forces at the Tehran talks.</p>
<p>The Soviet newspapers emphasized that the prolongation of the war will obviously strengthen the control of the Axis powers in the occupied areas and make it easier to carry out their war. On the side of the anti-Axis powers, who have different opinions on political thoughts and are pre-negotiating the handling of post-war issues, the prolongation of the war will increasingly create time and opportunity for differences of opinion between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union is trying to prevent such opportunities from being taken advantage of.</p>
<p>Germany Breaks Out of the Encirclement</p>
<p>Moriyama Correspondent (Berlin): I believe that the tension in the war situation is not necessarily due to the reasons of the anti-Axis forces. In this view, there is no observation of our hopes that the enemy camp is not aligned. Britain and the United States fear that the Soviet Union will win people's hearts or communize Europe, and for this political reason, they are forced to embark on a second front. This objective assessment can also be established. But that is not enough to explain everything. Britain and the United States may not be willing to engage in a dangerous second front because of face problems or people's hearts. The reason why the European war situation is tense is because the military strength of both sides is balanced. Now, the German side is quite unfavorable. If the anti-Axis forces intensify their offensive, Germany will surrender. This is what the anti-German camp is seeing now. The Soviet army's surprising advances on the Eastern Front, Italy's withdrawal, and the British and American air forces' continuous bombing of Germany. But on the other hand, Germany also has reasons to make the war situation tense. In the east, the Soviet army is pressing with unexpected force. In the west, two million British and American troops are waiting for an opportunity to land in Europe. What is even more worrying is that the occupied areas of the Balkans and Norway, and the allied countries, cannot be arbitrarily commanded, so Germany's position is quite difficult. It cannot concentrate its forces on one decisive battlefield.</p>
<p>Speaking of the organized terror bombing of the British and American air forces, the German air force has slowly raised its head. Assuming that the same terror bombing continues for the next month, what will be the state of the cities that are the source of Germany's national strength? Under these circumstances, purely taking a defensive battle and delaying the days is tantamount to sitting and waiting for death. The defensive battle is approaching its limit.</p>
<p>Hitler also often talks about this. In his New Year's address to the people, he said: "This year is the year to regain sovereignty." From the German point of view, it cannot but break through the encirclement and attack. In this way, the tension in the war situation has its reasons on both sides, and the European war has stepped into a major stage of confrontation.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Eastern Front <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun believes that what determines the war situation is military strength. From this point of view, what is the situation on the Eastern Front, where the fighting is currently the most intense and which will determine the future course of the war, and what are its future trends?</p>
<p>Kemuri: Since last summer, the Eastern Front has been in constant fierce fighting. The characteristic of the fighting during this period is that the German army has been on the defensive. The Red Army divided the German army's forces into three areas, forcing it to take a defensive position, that is, attempting to divide the German army's forces into three parts: the military front, the Mediterranean War, and the second front on the Atlantic coast. The Red Army's advances into German territory have been relatively large in the southern region, while in the central region, it has reached Belarus, and the northern region, which has been in a stalemate since last summer, has concentrated its main force.</p>
<p>Moriyama: The course of the Eastern Front and Badoglio's surrender shook the foundation of the German war plan. Since last summer, the German army has only used the necessary forces to block the Soviet army's attack at certain points, and has deployed new elite troops and reinforcements to the western and southern fronts. Hence, there was the great retreat of 400 kilometers from Kharkov to a certain point last year. So, where will the German army's planned retreat end? Where is the final defense line? From the stubborn defense of the Munchstein army in the bend of the Dnieper River, we can get a glimpse.</p>
<p>Then, from the 14th, the Soviet army suddenly shifted its center of attack to the area near Leningrad and Lake Ilmen in the north. The German army cannot ignore this tactic of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Watanabe Correspondent (Stockholm): From the point of view of neutral countries, the winter offensive seems to have reached its peak. The number of troops that the Soviet Union can use on the front line is very limited, and teenagers born in 1927 have already been mobilized. In order to cope with the second front, the German army continues to retreat in order to save manpower, and when necessary, will retreat to the Pog River on the Ukrainian front. This had already been decided before the winter arrived.</p>
<p>The German army's defense line on the Eastern Front is not like the Siegfried or Maginot lines, which have only one line, but has many defense lines and is a flexible defense line that is not easy to break through.</p>
<p>Taguchi Correspondent (Zurich): The key point of the Eastern Front is still the southern front. The main battles are now unfolding in the upper reaches of the Bug River. This aspect of the battle has a great impact on the military and political situation in the Balkans and must be paid close attention to.</p>
<p>At this stage, it is better for Romania and others to launch a comprehensive attack rather than a direct attack at a high price. The question of whether the army can break through the 1939 German-Soviet border line can only be answered after the battle in the upper reaches of the Bug River has developed (Shō: Alone, Two Men, One Day, Western Battle, Sunday Newspaper)</p>

<h3 id="e28">City to Hold Second Air Defense Day Tomorrow, With Air Defense and Fire Prevention Drills and Blackout <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Tomorrow (9th) is the city's second Air Defense Day. A Central News Agency reporter made a special visit to the "Shanghai Special City Civil Air Defense Headquarters" yesterday to record the various programs for the day:</p>
<p>Implementation of General Public Drills</p>
<p>Various districts will hold air defense and fire prevention drills at any time tomorrow. However, during these drills, unlike in the past when only designated baojia personnel participated in the drills, passers-by who hear the alarm must also participate in the drills in order to become proficient and prepare for any possible air raids. Therefore, citizens who go out on this day should wear air defense clothing if they have it, otherwise, they should wear casual clothes so that they can participate temporarily.</p>
<p>Blackout to be Held Tomorrow</p>
<p>In addition, a blackout will be held from 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. tomorrow, but no alarm will be sounded beforehand. Citizens should automatically close and set up their doors and windows properly starting at 8:00 p.m., ensuring that no light leaks outdoors. Police and baojia personnel will go to the streets to inspect, and those who violate the regulations will be severely punished. Therefore, citizens must pay close attention.</p>
<p>Air Defense Exhibition Awards</p>
<p>In addition, during the air defense exhibition held by the headquarters at the Racecourse on the first Air Defense Day, there were air defense drawings by students from various schools, many of which were excellent and were classified as excellent and given awards and certificates to encourage them. It is also scheduled to hold an award ceremony at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow (9th) in the conference room of the First District Public Office.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Wholesalers Request to Participate in Temporary Cotton Cloth Rationing; Trade Control Committee Submits Request to the Executive Yuan for Approval <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth Trade Association has submitted a request to the Trade Control Committee, stating that the livelihoods of cotton cloth wholesalers are on the verge of extinction, and requesting maintenance. They also proposed that the temporary cotton cloth rationing in Shanghai be jointly operated by all wholesalers, who would join the rationing work to prolong their survival and comply with the system. The wording was sincere. According to a reporter's investigation, the Trade Control Committee, upon receiving the request, believed that, according to the regulations on centralized distribution of wagered cotton products, there were original provisions for selecting wholesalers to handle the distribution. However, the temporary rationing in Shanghai this time is slightly different from ordinary rationing. Now that the traders are willing to operate jointly as a whole, the principle is still feasible. However, the temporary rationing in the city is urgently needed to be implemented, and it is not convenient to delay it because of this. In order to expedite the matter, the committee has transferred the matter to the Executive Yuan for approval, and at the same time, it has instructed the Cotton Cloth Trade Association to instruct the wholesalers to immediately prepare and report on how to participate in the rationing plan, their rights and obligations, and how they should be distributed, and wait for the Executive Yuan's order to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Second Phase of Special Flour Rationing for Various Industries <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Flour and Bran Unified Distribution Office implemented the unified special rationing of bran and flour needed for the business of various industries, it has now prepared the second phase of special rationing for various industries in the four areas of Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong. It is calculated that the tea food industry, the shredded gluten industry, the cake and steamed bun oil-fried food industry, the noodle-making tea food industry, the congee industry, the vermicelli industry, the restaurant industry, and the tea food store industry, etc., are each allotted eight bags of flour per member (including four bags each of number one flour and number two flour). It has been transferred to the respective trade associations for distribution to each member yesterday, and funds have been prepared to collect the flour from the four designated distribution points. Each trade association and each member who collects the flour must guarantee that the flour collected will only be used to make food and will not be privately sold for profit. At the same time, in order to assess the flour collection and manufacturing of various industries, the unified distribution office has approved members of each trade association to dispatch personnel to inspect the equipment of each industry starting tomorrow, and the distribution will be stopped for those without manufacturing equipment. Regarding the special rationing for various industries in the first district, including the former eighth district, the unified distribution office has reached an agreement with the first district public office to transfer it to the unified distribution office for centralized handling. It is expected that the assessment and rationing can be carried out in March, but only for members of each trade association.</p>

In order to maintain confidentiality, each branch bureau has been ordered to prepare a plan for issuing permits. At the same time, it is hoped that citizens in the district will make full use of their old photos to avoid wasting materials due to the issuance of new permits. In addition, the date and method of obtaining permits will be notified in due course to ensure that citizens understand the details and do not make fruitless trips.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Pork Retailers Association - Please Set Price Limits Quickly <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Since the Spring Festival, prices of various commodities have soared, especially daily necessities such as fish and meat. The person in charge of the Pork Retailers Association said: The association had foreseen this and submitted proposals to the Grain Bureau and the Economic Affairs Department before the Spring Festival to quickly establish a reasonable price evaluation committee, which must restrict the price of fresh pork on the market so that the price of retail pork can be stabilized. Recently, the price of fresh pork on the market has soared to 80 yuan, breaking the previous record. Therefore, the retail price has also approached 70 yuan per catty. If the authorities do not strengthen the evaluation mechanism within days, the rampant increase in pork prices is feared to be unimaginable. According to the report, the prices of foodstuffs sold in the British market, except for vegetables which have only slightly increased due to favorable weather conditions, have all increased by 30% to 40%, such as beef, mutton, chicken, and duck. The collusion of intermediary merchants is the main reason. The authorities should severely monitor and manage the merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Boiled Water Shops Appeal - Relax Water Consumption <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Boiled Water Industry Association, regarding the fact that the French Concession Water Company limits water consumption to no more than 100 cubic feet per month for each household, has submitted requests to the Shanghai Special Municipal Grain Bureau, Social Welfare Bureau, Economic Affairs Department of the First District Public Office, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other powerful agencies, requesting them to inform the company to find ways to relax the monthly water consumption limit for boiled water shops. It is reported that the officials in charge of the various agencies are deeply concerned about the situation of the boiled water shops and have decided to find ways to provide relief. According to the persons in charge of the industry association, Ji Daming and Zhang Long, the average monthly water consumption of boiled water shops is about 300 cubic feet, and the company's limited quantity is only one-third. Therefore, in January, each boiled water shop was fined a large sum of money, ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Since boiled water shops are all small businesses, they cannot be sustained under this threat. Therefore, it is hoped that the competent authorities will quickly find ways to provide relief, and at the same time, they hope that people from all walks of life will extend their sympathy and assistance.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Power Company Sends Personnel to Re-examine Meters <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>

This is to prevent situations of deception by users and meter readers. However, it is reported that the work undertaken by these re-examination personnel is randomly selected on Sundays, and these people are all equipped with professional identification documents. Each user should ask to see them first when they encounter an inspection, so as to avoid criminals taking advantage of the opportunity.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Football League's schedule for this week was announced yesterday. The two giants of Chinese football will play in the second round of the group stage at Yiyuan this Sunday morning. There are a total of four matches on Saturday. In Group A, Qiaolian will face the Jews again. In the first round, the Jews defeated Qiaolian 3-1. This time, Qiaolian will have the full force of the Italian Navy to assist, and they will seek revenge. The match between Donghua and Huatong in Group B2 is also a highlight. At the end of the week, Lianyi will face Donghua in the second round of Group A. They met at Jiaozhou Park in the first round, and Donghua defeated Lianyi 1-0. This time, another battle is inevitable, and Yiguo is expected to be even more crowded than before. In another Group A match, Yijing will face Portuguese Merchants at Jiaozhou Park. In the first round, Portuguese Merchants unexpectedly defeated Yijing 5-3. This week's schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Notice</p>
<p>Explanation of the Regulations Restricting Members from Participating in Small Football Matches - Article 1 of the association's notice on January 17th: "Any player registered in the association's Group A and Group B leagues shall not participate in any other small football matches before the end of the season. It is hoped that everyone will abide by this to maintain the spirit of the club." The purpose of this is to cultivate rising talents and seek technical progress. The association has repeatedly discussed and decided to implement this regulation after consulting with the Small Football Federation. The attached rules of football rules state that "Small football matches may be adopted if players are not old enough or strong enough, or if the playing field is not large enough, as basic training for junior players or as a substitute for football games." Small football matches are originally an exercise for football training. Players registered in the association's Group A and Group B leagues are old enough and already have a foundation in football techniques, so there is no need to retreat and receive basic training. In addition, the purpose of holding small football matches is also to cultivate football talents. If people with deeper techniques are still allowed to join the matches, it would be tantamount to seizing the opportunity for rising talents to participate in the matches. Therefore, the measure to limit Group A and Group B players from participating in small football matches (limiting participation in matches, not limiting small football movement) is actually to promote the universality of football movement and is not intended to restrict sports items. Moreover, Group A and Group B players are still free to participate in small football matches after the end of the association's season. In the match between the Russians and Portuguese Merchants on January 26th, Portuguese Merchants did not appear, and the team was judged to have forfeited. The Engineering Team declared its withdrawal from the league, and all matches in the schedule are cancelled.</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e50">Where is the Key? <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The key to wartime economic recovery and this year's agricultural and industrial production increase, in the usual sense, is nothing more than solving the shortage of raw materials, power limitations, and the food problem of workers. We also acknowledge that solving these difficulties is indeed a prerequisite for increasing production, but there are two most prerequisites. Forming the main key in the year of increased production, is what we absolutely cannot ignore, that is: Maintaining labor power, Eliminating speculative psychology. To make an analogy to medical principles, maintaining labor power is equivalent to making nourishing blood a prerequisite for increasing body weight: Eliminating speculative psychology is equivalent to making decay removal a prerequisite for new life.</p>
<p>Speaking of maintaining labor power, we express our deep sympathy for the recent labor and production increase movement promoted by the Ministry of Education of the National Government, which enables primary and secondary schools in various places to use school grounds and nearby gaps to unite all teachers and students to engage in reclamation work. In addition, such as promoting the return of "Danbang customers" to their hometowns and the participation of unemployed vagrants in factory labor are all ways to maintain labor power. Speaking of eliminating speculative psychology, we express our deep sympathy for what Mr. Yoshida Tosuke said in this newspaper's weekly review the day before yesterday, and what Mr. Hirose Kurataro said in yesterday's Xin Shen Bao weekly paper. Both of them believe that today's Chinese economic morbidity lies entirely in the rampant speculative behavior; one compares it to lung disease, and the other compares it to cancer. If you don't treat it with all your heart, it will be incurable. Therefore, eliminating speculative psychology is indeed the key among the keys.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Japanese National Policy Companies in China - Implement Universal Adjustments - Silk and Salt Industries Have Already Been Adjusted <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly implement economic cooperation with our country, the Japanese government authorities will make appropriate adjustments to the national policy companies in China, namely the North China Development Company and the Central China Revitalization Company. The initial purpose of establishing national policy companies was to plan for the early restoration of various industries and public utilities in North and Central China that were destroyed or damaged by the war. Having been established for only five years, the results are amazing. Today, in order to strengthen the national government's economy, the various industries of the national policy companies will be transferred to the national government for handling. The initial facts of the adjustment have been seen in the Central China Silk and Central China Salt industries. The former is to be dissolved, and the latter is to transfer all shares of Guantian and the Japanese side to our country. The adjustment process of this company is progressing extremely smoothly, and other companies will continue to be adjusted.</p>

The reporter has investigated and recorded their names, capital (in thousands of units), and the percentage of Japanese investment as follows: Huazhong Electroplating 20,000 (23.5%), Huazhong Hydropower 43,000 (49.9%), Inland River Transportation 6,000 (45.0%), Electrical Communication 15,000 (40.0%), Huazhong Public Bus 3,000 (53.5), Huazhong Railway 64,000 (71.1), China Shipping 3,000 (19.3), Huazhong Transportation 8,000 (20.0), Huazhong Match 10,000 (40.0).</p>
<p>Gradual Advancement</p>
<p>It is also learned that the reorganization of various companies will be gradually advanced according to the following principles: those related to military operations will still adopt the same method as before; those related to the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood will be left to the Chinese to handle, and those whose efficiency can be expected to increase will be operated by the Chinese as much as possible; regarding other aspects, national capital will be introduced to strengthen them, and the cooperation of Chinese personnel will be sought to prevent economic regression and increase productivity. The specific methods of adjustment are roughly divided into five points: decentralization, transfer, capital correction, personnel structure correction, and correction of preferential treatment for reviewing policy companies.</p>

<p>Recently, merchants in various industries have had new attempts. Their business direction has gradually changed. Most have rented suitable houses and opened retail departments. Therefore, there has been a sudden increase in the establishment of new businesses recently. It is reported that these merchants once possessed a large amount of domestic goods. Now, because they are not easy to sell, they have set up their own retail departments to sell them in order to realize cash. But the profits they obtain are quite considerable.</p>

<p>In recent months, speculation in the stock market has become increasingly serious. According to official opinions, the proliferation of floating capital in various places and the flourishing of speculative businesses, as well as companies engaged in real estate transactions and investment enterprises, are mostly inclined to speculation. In order to prevent the spread of this situation, the Ministry of Industry originally decided to suspend the establishment of new companies across the board from the 22nd of last month. Now, in view of the fact that this crisis still exists, it has been decided to strictly enforce this measure, restricting the establishment of new companies on one hand and restricting the popular increase of company capital on the other. At the same time, the listed stocks will be strictly audited so that legitimate enterprises will not suffer adversely due to the rampant speculation.</p>

<p>The Pharmaceutical Association has recently rectified and revised the regulations regarding cargo packaging and warehouse rent in transactions among peers. The revised methods are as follows: For goods delivered within this city, whether in whole pieces or in small quantities, they must be inspected immediately after delivery, and no disputes will be allowed afterward. For losses or spoilage during transportation to other cities, the buyer shall bear the responsibility and it has nothing to do with the seller. The packaging, whether it be boxes, bags, baskets, or other containers, if it does not match the original weight, must be sent to the seller. The price of the burlap bags used for packing small quantities within this city should be added to the invoice. When the burlap bags are returned, the price paid for them will be refunded. For goods stored in the warehouse by the buyer, if they are not taken out immediately, the storage rent will be limited to one month. If they are not taken out after the deadline, the buyer shall pay twelve yuan per month for each item. If it is less than one month, it will be calculated as one month. In case of accidents, etc., the buyer shall be responsible.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks re-entered a volatile situation. Initially, they continued the upward trend from the end of last week, but were pushed down by those seeking to sell for cash. The range narrowed throughout the day, and most industry stocks ultimately rose. The sentiment on all sides was somewhat dazed. Because full-day trading had resumed, the volume of transactions was strong. In the department store sector, Wing On Company immediately fell back after reaching 240 yuan, ultimately closing lower along with Sincere Company and National Goods. Guanghua and New Sincere and other department stores rose instead, especially the latter, which rose by a large margin of seven yuan. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile Mill rose by two yuan, while Mei Asia fell slightly by one yuan. China Textile, National Trust, Board Rich, and Great China Weaving all saw gains. King Fu Shirt &amp; Hosiery rose by more than three yuan amid news of capital increases, breaking through the 40 yuan mark. In the new pharmaceutical sector, China-West touched the 100 yuan mark, while China Pharmaceuticals fell slightly. New Asia and others continued to rise. Chemical stocks remained firm. In the cultural sector, Jinfeng Paper saw high prices again. China Film and World Book Bureau saw no gains. Public utility stocks were the most stable. In the real estate sector, China Land was the only one to rise significantly, while Wing Hing and others had gains of about one yuan. Other industries such as Kang Yuan Confectionery saw active trading, and Jiu An and Xinghua and other industrial companies all saw gains. The closing table is recorded below.</p>
<p>Summary of Business Conditions: Public bonds traded in a mixed pattern yesterday, fluctuating in a narrow range. The environment should have been favorable, but the buying pressure was heavy, so it was not easy to rise. There were many floating buyers and floating sellers, and those who settled on the same day traded very actively. It was not easy to see sharp rises or falls, and it is feared that it will continue to fluctuate for a while. Class C bonds opened at 2nd level 3rd grade, seven grades better than last week, and then rose to 3rd level 2nd grade, but because there were more sellers, it fell back to 2nd level 6th grade, but soon rose to hard. The call loan interest rate remained stable. Yesterday morning, the call loan interest rate was still at 20%, unchanged. Yesterday, it was not easy to supply, resulting in a reduction in the source of goods. Cargo owners miscellaneous transactions were slow. Yesterday's miscellaneous goods were firm, but the volume of transactions was not strong. Taicang soybeans were 1,320, and Pinghu She beans were 1,550. Raw materials for construction were strong. The market was still in short supply. The selling price yesterday had reached 3rd level 5th grade, ordinary soil lime was 2nd level 4th grade, and small soda ash in barrels was strong at 1st level 2nd grade, and the packaging was slightly lower at 1st level. The price of artificial silk was flat. Yesterday, the market traded very little, and the price of 100-number Tianqiao was around 10 yuan.</p>

<p>— By Iwata Takeshi, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Around 5:00 AM on March 25th, Masato was wearing a worn-out Second Middle School uniform, carrying a package that was even bigger than when he went to school, and entered the third-class waiting room of Nishikagoshima Station. His older brother, Yoshibi, and Taro were protecting their mother, sitting on the long bench. April 1st was the day of enrollment at the Etajima Naval Academy. In Masato's pocket was a booklet of "Notice to Prospective Enrolled Students."</p>
<p>"There's not much to say, take care of your health and work hard." At such times, mothers don't say anything beyond what mothers usually say. But these ordinary words deeply moved Masato.</p>
<p>At this time, Ryuufu and his sister, Kiyoko, also arrived.</p>
<p>"It's a bother for you...you didn't have to come. We already said goodbye last night..."</p>
<p>Masato said deliberately in a loud voice. The night before, a farewell party had been held for Masato at Ryuufu's house. Without paying attention to Masato's words, Ryuufu said:</p>
<p>"Don't forget to write!" His voice was overflowing with friendship.</p>
<p>Kiyoko, for some reason, raised her eyebrows as if nothing was happening.</p>
<p>"Oh! Congratulations." At that time, Mr. Ohara and Mr. Ogata came to the waiting room with the main students of the military class. All the teachers, including the principal, had gone to say goodbye a few days ago, but they all came to the station to see him off. This was really too much. The teachers and classmates all said that after seeing Masato off on the 7:35 train, they could return to school and still be in time for the start of classes, so Masato was relieved.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much." His mother and brothers thanked them sincerely. Soon it was time to board the train. No matter how they declined, the teachers insisted on seeing him off on the train.</p>
<p>The slow train departing from the old Kagoshima Station pulled into the station meanderingly. Masato solemnly thanked the teachers and then entered the third-class carriage at the rear. Because there was a five-minute stop, Masato leaned out of the window and talked to his friends.</p>
<p>"Don't forget to come back during summer vacation!" Tani Yohei, who was not in the military class but had also come to see him off, said this.</p>
<p>"Hmph...we'll still be swimming at the Tenpozan beach!" Masato said with a smile. Because this was an honorable departure, his smile was more imposing than usual.</p>
<p>Finally, the bell rang before departure.</p>
<p>When Ryuufu leaned against the window impatiently, Kiyoko ran up to him and opened her mouth, "Going to the Navy all by yourself, you're so proud!..."</p>
<p>Like a flash of lightning, the words were spoken at the same time as the train's whistle sounded.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Because he had been on this road once before under the leadership of Major Kikuchi, Masato did not need to be flustered. But the boredom of waiting for the train change in Shimonoseki made him think of the words Kiyoko had said and the character of this girl.</p>
<p>(What a bold little girl! I've never seen a girl like that. It's like she hates me deeply:) Masato couldn't guess the reason at all, no matter why she hated him. But he couldn't help but feel that this was a really interesting girl and couldn't help but laugh...</p>
<p>When the train arrived in Kure City, it was still dark. After buying a lunch box and eating breakfast in the waiting room, he walked along the narrow road to Kawarayshi Pier. By then, he had already forgotten about Kiyoko. He took the first regular boat and crossed to Etajima. The Seto Inland Sea in spring is different from summer, floating with beautiful colors. Suddenly, he noticed that in the boat there were people who looked like his comrades carrying big packages and tarpaulin leather bags, gazing at the shape of the warships.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Ogawa, there was a bus waiting. But Masato remembered that when he came the year before last, he had walked on foot. The road was also well repaired.</p>
<p>A small mountain that looked like a miniature of Mount Takachiho stood on the right side of the road. That was the famous Mount Furue. Masato already knew this when he came to visit the year before last. Late-blooming camellias and peach blossoms were in full bloom everywhere.</p>
<p>(Looking at Mount Furue in the morning and evening, there must be indescribable beauty...)</p>
<p>He suddenly felt uneasy. Because he was not yet the "Student-kun" that the villagers of Etajima called him. He was just a prospective enrolled student. Before enrollment, he still had to undergo a strict physical examination, and he had heard that during this physical examination, as many as several people had their enrollment qualifications revoked.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Suggestions for Levying Wartime Stock Transaction Profit Tax <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— By Ni Xiaotong</p>
<p>In the past year, the production industry in Shanghai has been thriving! Superficially, this can be said to be a good phenomenon in wartime, and even more so in the year of total decisive battle; moreover, the continuous capital increase by operators further demonstrates the joy and hardship of the production industry. As a result, various stocks have flooded the market. In order to prevent the malfeasance of illegal speculators, the authorities have promulgated laws to approve a certain number of stocks that can be freely traded to show restrictions, which is indeed appropriate. In fact, however, the following abnormal phenomena have arisen in the current stock market.</p>
<p>The circulation of approved stocks is actually greater than the total amount of stocks before approval, with no decrease. The daily transaction volume is double what it used to be. The number of people engaged in stock trading is greater than the number of people in the industry. Try to observe the current production situation of various production industries after being approved to issue stocks and increase capital? I dare say that the majority remain the same as before; only the value of their assets has increased. As a result, there is no reasonable positive proportion between productivity and assets.</p>
<p>Given the above phenomena, what is the cause? I dare say: the authorities' efforts to guide floating capital into legitimate channels are insufficient. Operators, in order to cater to the psychology of investors, do not hesitate to cleverly create sensational names to issue stocks, waiting for investors to sell them well. Investors are confused by the rapid profits and simple procedures, and also have the mentality of "if I don't get rich now, when will I?" Therefore, they also do not hesitate to devote all their efforts to speculation. Those above issue orders but do not ask much; those below obey orders but do not carry them out forcefully; the people lack patriotic concepts and misunderstand the implementation of certain policies as a "way to make money" for a few special people. Therefore, they do not hesitate to use various means to engage in bribery in order to fulfill their desire for profit. With this cause and effect, it is difficult for a country, especially in wartime, to achieve comprehensive and smooth progress in economic policy.</p>
<p>According to various countries in the world, when engaging in acts of war against foreign countries, they mostly promulgate laws to levy wartime profit tax. This is indeed a good strategy to restrict illegal profiteering. Now that our country has jointly shouldered the important task of creating a new order in Greater East Asia with its allies, economic construction in the rear cannot be delayed. If we want to achieve perfect economic construction, taxation is unavoidable. Now, from a personal standpoint, what is the effect of levying a profit tax on stock trading?</p>
<p>It can make the reality of all production industries measurable. It can allow the rich to realize that they have a greater obligation to pay taxes to the country, especially in wartime. It can make people realize that it is inappropriate to engage in illegal profiteering, and they will inevitably engage in thrift and not waste it arbitrarily. If everyone can adhere to the principle of saving as much as possible, how can hoarders flourish? How can all prices be stimulated and soar? Moreover, it can enable people above and below to recognize that engaging in legitimate business can benefit both oneself and others; indirectly, it greatly assists the country's wartime economic policy.</p>
<p>Here, we dare say that the current rise in prices and the difficulty of living have many causes. To put it bluntly, the psychology of "taking advantage of the fire" and "illegal profiteering" of various people has contributed to it. The wealth comes easily and greatly, so they are extravagant; when the money is exhausted, they must exhaust their minds to seek ways to obtain multiple profits. The desire for high profits, simple matters, and rapid time can only come from stock trading, which is the current trend of the public. After obtaining profits, they will exhaust the energy of extravagance and pleasure. In this way, everyone follows suit; legitimate businesses lack consultants, and productivity declines day by day! Then how can prices not be stimulated and soar? How can stability occur? How can the controlled economy policy be completed?</p>
<p>Therefore, we will loudly appeal: In order to ensure that "increased production" can be effectively achieved? In order to ensure that legitimate production enterprises can develop day by day; in order to eliminate illegal speculation that endangers people's livelihoods; in order to make people understand the importance of wartime thrift and savings to overcome future difficulties; the authorities should levy a heavy wartime profit tax on this speculative business, stock trading, which is the trend of the public!
