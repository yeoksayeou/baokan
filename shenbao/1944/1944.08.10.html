<p>代論</p>
<h3>衡陽佔領以後</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>問：渝美軍隊竭盡全力死守衡陽，終於日前被甘軍佔領，對於今後大陸戰局有何影響？</p>
<p>答：衡陽在中國大陸的戰局中，爲決戰階段的戰略重心之一，渝美以把握衡陽，爲屏蔽西南控制東南的根據地，且爲對日空襲的大陸空軍基地網之中心點。今衡陽失守，則旣不能進而準備所謂大反攻，退又喪失其「抗戰」根據地的前衛陣地。對於渝美前途自有莫大影響。</p>
<p>問：日軍佔領衡陽後有何重大意義？</p>
<p>答：此次日木陸海空軍密切協同，推進湘贛粵邊區的大戰，終於佔領衡陽，已經完成初步戰略目標，實爲大陸決戰勝利的基石。從此　可以解除和平地域乃至日木空襲的最大威脅，　可以進而打通京漢粵漢兩路，促進大東亞大陸鐵道的全綫貫通，使大陸與南洋打成一片。</p>
<p>問：那麼這次佔領衡陽，政治上的意義也一定不小吧？</p>
<p>答：從此，桂黔川滇西南諸省，已經和粵漢路以東的東南半壁隔絕，抗戰地區更為之縮小，和平區勢力為之擴大，其結果可不言而喻。而且從此日軍爭得對渝軍政行動的主動權，對於重慶治下民心的影響當然也是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>間：在此渝美關係盡力調整之際，衡陽之失陷，對渝方外交有何影響？</p>
<p>答：第一，美方對於重慶的抗戰實力，不能不增加疑慮；第二，渝方上下對於美國援華的實力亦將失去信仰，因爲此次「保衛衡陽」己有美國陸空軍直接參加。第三，美國正在盡力調停渝共關係，經此軍事失敗，其前途演變也屬大可注目。</p>
<p>問：有人說衡陽之陷落，經濟上的意義高於一切，尊見以爲如何？</p>
<p>答：「湖廣熟，天下足」，這是說兩湖食糧生產對中原各省關係之重要，所以湖南爲古來兵家必爭之地，尤以衡陽爲粵漢湘桂兩大鐵路之交叉點，同時父爲湘贛公路及水運之樞紐，近年來爲西南東南諸省物資交流中心。得之者霸，失之則窘，理由很明顯。此外衡陽一帶軍需物資如鉻鎢等產量亦不少，在決戰階級「總力動員」中，尤爲重要。</p>
<p>問：今後中國大陸戰局前途如何？</p>
<p>答：此次衡陽之戰，不僅爲中國大陸戰塲一大戰役，而且對於東亞戰局，亦有重要意義。在此美軍妄圖以「越島戰略」向日本本土突進之時，主要還賴大陸空軍的協同動作及大陸軍事反攻之推進，以爲聲援，今則此種計劃已成泡影，自將使太平洋戰局爲之改觀。</p>
<p>日政府增强戰力　決動員科學技術　施行細則奏請後昨日公布</p>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日本政府爲期動員科學技術及人文自然科學效能起見，六月七日由國家總動員審議會依據勅令案要鋼，制定調查研究事業，本月四日已經閣議決定，經奏請後，定九日公布施行規則，並自即日起實施之。該勅令以統制調查研究事業爲目的，全文共分十七條，依照國家總動員法第五條，規定協力調查研究業務，根據該法第十三條第一項規定，調查研究事業之設施管理，根據該法第十六條規定，調查研究事業之開始讓渡廢止停止等，該調查硏究科學技術機關外，其關於一般調查硏究機關，均在內閣指導監督下，由調查研究動員本部適當其運營。其科學技術研究機關，由技術院担任運營之，此項法令規定後，日本戰力增强之根幹調查研究，將有劃期之躍進。</p>
<h3>强化女子動員</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日政府為應付決戰之現階段，曾一度强化軍動員及勞動員圈之男子，勞勵之供給漸感有不足，一方煤礦·造船·鐵鍋·國防建設等重要部門，亦漸有需要增加男子勞力之傾向，故日政府曾竭力計劃强化女子勤勞動員，圖確保男子之勞力。現該計劃業已草就，日閣議時由廣瀨厚相詳細說明關於男子職工配置規正事項後，已正式決定，該成案將澈底强化女子動員。同時並限制雇用男子職員，視時間以女子代替之，而將男子轉配其他重要部門，期以適應勤勞配置，而使男女勤勞總力，就於戰鬥配置之本格。</p>
<h3>日精銳部隊掃蕩　衡陽周圍渝殘軍　中國大陸敵美空軍完全失敗</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　渝美聯合軍盡力守衛要衝衡陽，卒於八日陷落。湖南方面日軍，自攻略長沙後，即沿粵漢綫急進南下，迫近衡陽外廓，六月二十六日佔領衡陽市街對岸之機塲，二十八日遂完成包圍衡陽之形勢。邇來四句間日軍以部一兵力包圍衡陽城，另以主力軍殲滅渝野戰軍於湘江東西地區，迎擊企岡解救衡陽之渝第九第六兩戰區軍，並繼續展開殲滅戰。敵美鑑於衡陽在軍事上之重要性，爲堅守該市計，特　勵渝軍作戰，同時蔣介石氏亦因衡陽若一旦失陷，將予重廳政權以致命打擊，故命令部下死守。爲死守該城計，特由敵美軍之作戰指導者指導防衛作戰，同時動員美空軍竭力掩護衡陽，故連日飛翔於戰塲上空之飛機，已達百餘架。民國三十一年一月，第二次長沙作戰之際，長沙防衛指導官第十軍軍長方先覺，曾以虛僞宣傳獲得抗戰英雄之尊稱，此次衡陽作戰，氏親率兵約四師團困守城中，賴空中補給外及外圍來援，頑强抵抗，日軍精銳在擊滅渝野戰軍後，閒始準備攻城，八月四日薄暮，在空軍部隊協力下，開始總攻，以三日有半之時，剿滅城內四師渝軍。八日上午八時八分，完全佔領術陽，此乃攻闡以來之第四十一日也。日軍視仍在掃蕩衡陽周團之渝野戰軍。</p>
<p>中央社訊　衡陽陷落後，中國方面官民認爲不僅在軍事上，即在經濟政治上，亦均有莫大好影響。日軍今後行動，雖不能預測，但過去數次湖南作戰，均爲輾轉作戰，亦可明瞭日軍控制衡陽長沙後，不但今後在粵漢湘桂綫之新軍事行動障碍排除，其經濟上向美國輸出之銻桐油等重要物資，均入日軍之手。日軍保持湖南省後，上海南京國府治下民衆生活，益將安定，今後上海財界，所蒙恩惠，頗堪期待。</p>
<p>敵美空軍遭受重創</p>
<p>中國前綫某基地九日中央社電　日機會與美空軍於衡陽戰區上空，展開而戰。自六月下旬，日軍佔領衡陽機塲後，據守衡陽之渝軍，即繼續抵抗，並奉命死守該市，此舉出於駐渝美空軍之要求。因日機若能良由飛翔於衡陽上空，則桂林即完全成爲前進基地，而遂川，建　，玉山等前進基地，亦完全孤立無援，故美空軍有此要求，同時以過去所朱有之努力，協力渝軍，並傾空軍全力反攻，故湖南戰綫一前之間，渝美作戰之飛機，已達二千架之多。彼等不分晝夜，屢次襲擊日軍後方補給綫，並盲炸渝美空軍六月來，歷時四句，相互為衡陽之攻防死戰。其中最激烈者，即雙方由空中對衡陽所展開之補給戰。又關於衡陽之陷落，可謂美空軍於日美空戰中已完全失敗。至此，中國大陸方面之空戰已步放劃期之階段，今後之空戰，乃係日空軍基地之推進，及新空戰之展開。</p>
<p>萍鄕醴陵擴大戰果</p>
<p>中國前綫某基地九日中央社電　萍鄉醴陵地區日軍，刻仍繼續作殲滅戰，正對附近之　敗渝軍作澈底之掃蕩。二日以來，於白竺（醴陵南方約四十公里）方面復對渝第七十二軍殘餘主力，續行壯烈之殲滅戰。該方面渝軍係第七十二軍三十四師，白竺附近一帶之山地峻險，密林縱續，故連續進攻之日軍極爲艱苦。刻日軍已漸形縮短包圍網，到處進攻渝軍陣地，而擴大戰果。</p>
<p>渝方軍隊戰意消沉</p>
<p>中央社訊　是近由重慶逃來此間之一學生。對重慶之民衆動態　稱，最近重慶之靑年學生，如有二人以上之集聚者，檢討此次戰敗之原因，無不激烈斥責重慶之頹廢。對每戰必敗之重慶軍之脆弱，與美軍之空口援助大施非難。其所指摘重慶敗戰之原因，大多有以下幾點：　前綫部隊長久駐屯於一地區，以致士氣低下。　駐屯部隊之隊長照例與現地　民互相結納，以肥私囊，因此士兵自然亦照例模倣，軍紀因而弛緩。　重慶軍武器藥彈之補給頗不圓滑，美國式訓練之成果，亦不若彼所宣傳之精良。士兵每月　一百八十元，無論任何生活，均難以維持。　由於軍隊對民衆之榨取，故軍民之間，隔膜甚深。對以上四點，重慶當局卸脫責任，謂　重慶之敗潰，緣於英美援助之不切。　駐渝美空軍之實力薄弱，難阻日軍之攻勞。　英美軍並顧問團，恬不知恥，曾謂長沙洛陽無死守必要。此次衡陽陷落，或亦將謂無法死守必耍，而猛力迥避敗戰之責任。　爲呆全民衆之生命財產，故而撤退。戰力，咸作諉卸責任之詞，刻已陷於靑年層攻擊與病篤之氛圍中云。</p>
<h3>雷州半島　日軍進攻</h3>
<p>中國戰綫某基地九日中央社電　雷州半島方面日軍，在陸軍相互協力下，述日進攻。日急降轟炸機隊，二日拂曉對遂溪北方十公里馬頭嶺渝軍正面陣地之堡壘羣，以及蝟集於該地東方十公里良洞墟附近之渝軍，猛加轟炸。五日再度空襲良洞墟西北八公里赤嶺附近之渝軍，四日拂曉爲呼應地上部隊之進攻廉江，復轟炸該地北方高地之渝軍陣地，日地上部隊沿小道進擊，予渝軍以重創，該地距渝美空軍機動基地丹竹甚近，不見敵踪跡，可知敵空軍力量已形弱化。</p>
<h3>實部派員北上　商物資交流　燃料問題可望解決</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　實業部爲物資供應充沛，南北物資交流圓滑，及疏通華中一帶煤斤來源，解決動力原料與燃料之困難諸問題，爰決定派該部商業司長陶國賢北上，與華北各有關方面會談對策。陶氏業於日前銜命北上，與各關係方面開始籌商，預卜經此項之連絡後，對於南北物資之交流，煤斤之來源等問題，必可迎刃而解。</p>
<h3>軍訊會議　昨開二次會</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　九日爲軍事委員會全國名級無綫電台軍訊會議第二日，是日上午九時，假國民大會堂二樓會議室，舉行第二次會議。出席全體會員，由首席參謀次長張恒主席，領導行禮如儀後，即由張總合長報吿出席列席人數及文件，曁會議第一日審查未通過之提案。旋即審議及決議各組番查完畢之提案，會議在十二時半始畢，又於同時午後三時，繼續召開討論曾，仍分組審查未決議之提案，各會員均提供意見甚多。</p>
<p>（又訊）十日爲會議第二日，該會定上午十一時舉行閉幕式，中午鮑總參謀長假中央飯店設宴招待全體會員。又晚七時，張總台長假南洋元綫電學校，宴請全體會員。</p>
<h3>中央黨部舉行　參戰紀念會</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電紀念會，戴副秘書長策領　中央然部今日舉行參戰導宣讀宣戰佈吿，並爲前綫將士爭取勝利致敬，爲傷病將士康復致祝，爲陣亡將士靜默致悼。</p>
<h3>治運一期工程　月中可望開工</h3>
<p>南京九日中央社電　治理運河工務局，於前次召商承包治運第一期工程，審標完竣後，決定中日商興南公司得標，茲悉該項工程合同，業已簽定，現公司常局已派員前往工地籌劃開工之一切進備事宜，約於本月十五日當可開工。</p>
<h3>炸黃河橋敵機　被擊落一架</h3>
<p>北京九日中央社電　駐渝美空軍P25型機二架，曾於三日總轟炸京漢綫黃河鐵橋附近，因遭日軍陸上部隊防空砲火阻　，僅盲目投彈後，即行遁去。內中一架因中彈於官子街（洛陽西南三十五公里）附近墮落，機體及駕駛員屍體，頃已被日軍夢備隊發現。</p>
<h3>日荒木大將講　近代戰本質</h3>
<p>東京九日中央社電　日本之東洋文化夏期大學，業自七日起循例於輕津澤開始，聽講生有日人，歐洲人，共榮圈各地人及印度人等，第一日（七日）講師男爵荒木貞夫大將，以戰爭之目的爲題，講述近代戰爭之本質。就中大將就「武」之意義，說明如次：在英美之戰法，頗饒興趣，「武」者，雖僅視之爲軍國主義，但今日一般所謂之「武」，已與軍國主義概念全然不同。日本人使用日本刀法，最能表現「武」之精神，日本軍人決不用日本刀作無辜之慘殺，或單就防備自己，作無益之流血。因之，始終為守義而動劍，亦即日本為求得世界和平，期全人類各得其所，而揮其正義之刀，故日太之戰爭目的，始終基於武土道之傳統精神。</p>
<p>出淵報道部長　談衡陽攻略戰　今後日軍佔極有利優勢</p>
<p>昨日日軍陸軍部出淵報道部長，在華懋飯店舉行記者例會中，對於此次衡陽之陷落，發表談話如次：部長首謂渝蔣所恃以爲銅牆鐵壁之衡陽，卒於昨日（八日）爲日軍所攻陷。衡陽之陷落，在駐渝美空軍及渝軍今後之戰略大勢上，已予以一澈底而重大之打擊。衡陽在湖南於政治經濟上，均爲重要之地位，日軍此次攻佔該地，在戰略上，今後在任何方面均佔進攻時極爲有利之優勢，故此次衡陽之陷落，在渝方精神物質雙方損失，均屬慘重巨大，尤以　渝美軍所受者，為重大而致命。</p>
<p>美軍計劃化為泡影</p>
<p>茲試分述如下：第一，利用渝方戰力與大陸基地之美軍，欲由大陸包圍日軍之鬼計，因此次衡陽之攻佔，已完全化爲泡影。第二，衡陽之陷落，實亦決定爲中國賓庫之湖南的全部命運，尤以美方一向在渝抓取湖南豐富之鑛產，已屬究全不可能。第三，衡陽飛機塲，今後成爲日空軍基地後，則華中華南之美空軍恃爲心臟之要地，即已失去，抑且利用中國大陸之美軍。至此已全部無可再　其　　，而陷於絕境。</p>
<p>附庸英美所得結果</p>
<p>部長又謂此次衡陽之攻略戰，日軍擊滅渝軍計四師，此皆附席英美空軍應得之結果。已往帝國政府，屢加聲明，凡拒絕與英美協力合作者，雖渝軍亦非日軍之敵，民衆更無論矣。衡陽及已往各地日軍之攻略，要皆基於此種精神而得圓滿完遂。在此次衡陽及其他虞塲，為日軍殲滅之渝軍，大性格上無一非眞正之渝，實皆可謂謂美軍之附庸軍而已。日軍攻戰衡陽，爲期一月餘，衡陽之敵，確已盡力敢能戰，旦與美軍之協力，亦可謂密切，惜此種努力，徒然助畏美英之侵略東亞犧牲中國之野心，對於東亞民族，實無絲毫貢獻，對於犧牲於衡陽戰塲中之多數　軍，其勇敢可佩，然其受愚而致誤國裏身，實屬可憫可嘆，覺有無限同情也。</p>

<h3>軍人叛國案主犯　八名昨執行絞刑　德官方公布法庭審訊經過</h3>
<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：柏林人民法庭對七月二十日政變之主犯八名判處死刑後，昨晚發表官方公報稱：「大德國人民法庭於七，八兩日審問參加七月二十日罪案之叛國犯八人，該犯等已被開除軍籍，計開：維資萊本·霍浦納·史蒂夫·哈斯·柏那狄斯·克勞辛·華坦堡·及哈根等八人，因叛國罪判處死刑，其財產充公，判決兩小時後，各被告執行絞決。</p>
<p>大審詳情　　柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：對謀刺德元首要犯八人之審問，在普魯士最高法院舉行之。外界對此次大審，於事前並無所知，故法院屋外並無羣衆，亦無但任警戒之警察，惟於法庭之入口，嚴密檢查旁聽證。法庭成長方形，佈置簡單，上設菲得烈大帝與德元首之半身像。牆上有五窗，因天氣炎熱大開不閉。</p>

<p>柏林九日中央社電　海通社訊：法西北部戰區之局勢仍無決定，反軸心軍企圖保持其主動權，儘可能擴大其佔領區，德軍方面則更能自由作戰，以實施其對策。德軍反攻之重心，不在布列塔尼，而在法國內地，因該區集中大量之後備軍，更有可測。因大軍移動至布列塔尼甚為困難，故德軍任令在該區國隊自行抵抗。長驅直入該半島之美軍坦克車隊，已被阻於聖馬羅·勃萊斯特·羅利翁·與聖那齊附近。在諾曼第與洛爾河下游，向東與東南推進之美第三軍，於略有所得後，其進展已見運緩，該軍之主力尙在邁揚納河沿岸，其前鋒則分爾路進攻薩特河。諾曼第之戰事仍屬激烈，塞龍河上游與西河間美第一軍之右翼遭遇德軍局部之反攻，敵軍雖有優勢空軍之掩護，但未能阻止德軍之反攻。德軍坦克車隊向西進展數公里，西河迤北在塞倫斯·聖波伊區東進之美軍繼越壓力，惟所得甚微。該軍他部自維爾城深入德軍陣地，現激戰正在進行中。英第二軍在維爾與吐萊哈考特間進攻德軍新陣綫，惟規模不大，吐萊哈考特與蒲萊間仍有大戰，英軍向東進攻於渡越奧納河後，佔領格里姆巴斯克城，德軍反攻初尙能將敵軍逐回奥納河岸，敵軍旋調到大量生力軍來援，再度進人格里姆巴斯克城，與其附近之森林，現該處尙有爭奪戰，加拿大軍正面進攻該綫未逞，星期一敵軍在該區與奥納及克恩，法萊斯公路間加緊壓力。</p>

<h3>大陸空戰情况　美駐渝空軍活動被阻</h3>
<p>七月十三日晨，轟炸駐渝美空軍前進根據地桂林的航空要塞，敵機起火幷擊毀者，合計達八十九架。建此殊動的日方轟炸機，乃費盡心血所時別製造的飛機，這上面的發動機，機翼，以至於每一支小釘，都溶和了戰時產業戰士之寶貴的心靈。思念及此，這些飛機實是極可尊愛的。下面是大陸戰綫上飛機怎樣活躍的報吿：</p>
<p>這些轟炸機連夜出動夜間轟炸駐渝美空軍基地，每次都獲得赫赫戰果。七月以來，三日在湖南省芷江擊毀十九架，七日在江西省贛州擊毀八架，九日在桂林擊毀二十八架，十二日再至芷江擊毀五十一架，十三日又在桂林一舉殲滅八十九架。綜合本年一月以來的綜合戰果，敵機起火被毀者達四百架以上。散佈於天陸的敵主要基地，沒有一處不受日本轟炸機的夜襲。</p>
<p>六月十六日美國B24型機空襲北九州後，追襲而立即加以炸毀復仇的，也是這種轟炸機。在夜間空製中，從未達路，在任何塲合，必能正確地到達目的地。正確地轟炸。在基地的敵機，都是覬覦日本本土而待機中的敵機。殲滅這些敵機，也就是阻止空襲本土。賴此轟炸機與戰鬥機同在大陸奮鬥，使敵人感到非常威脅，而日本本土亦賴此高枕無憂。常有以一機炸毀敵十數機者，故日本一機的存在，阻止敵十數的空製本土。在這意義上，全國的產業戰士諸君喲！請多造一機，多送一機赴前綫。大陸的空軍們，忘却自己的功績，祗有表示感謝的誠意，等待諸君製造更優秀的飛機·多送一機到前綫來。</p>
<p>某部隊長變</p>
<p>記者會與某部隊長對談，獲聞大陸空戰的情况，茲記之於下：</p>
<p>記者：目前實施中的我方作戰之意義如何？</p>
<p>部隊長：駐渝美空軍爲遂行其任務起見，在中國東軍部選定對日空襲的根據地，在桂林以東的龐大地區，建設無數的航空要塞羣，正在積極進行，我軍不待其完成，即先下手開始粉碎這企圖的作戰。狼狼的敵人，撤退東南正面，北方正面的基地軍，以主力圖於昆明·重慶之綫，而以有力的機動兵力散置於桂林，芷江·丹竹·柳州各基地，觀我第一綫的間隙，更迅速建造中央及西北基地，爲B29出發點，再度侵入北九州。上述敵人企圖，他們在中國大陸的戰略，乃恒久的波狀作戰，即恃其畫長期間作波浪形的起伏，而企圖使波浪愈湧愈高。我部隊用質與精神力對壓倒優勢的敵物量，在周密的企劃下，實施毫無間隙的作戰。</p>
<p>記者：雙方在中國的航空兵力如何？</p>
<p>部隊長：對於數量，一定限度的量是絕對必耍的。我們的量很少，但這已很够了。不過兵士們的希望，要求更多的飛機。今鑒於各方面的戰局，及後方的情狀，兵士們不再作此要求了，而寗願以其沸騰的鬥志與質的優秀來補其不足。</p>
<p>記者：以後的敵情呢？</p>
<p>部隊長：我方縱連續獲得大戰果，他們還是不可侮的。美機將往西北方面的基地執抝地前來進攻。（譯自七月十八日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>顧保甲處長　談保甲行政　全市保甲制度一元化</h3>
<p>自本市警政統一後，關於全市保甲制度，亦歸趨一元化，今後警保聯繫，益見新的形態之樹立，中央社記者爲求明瞭市區新併區域之警保情形，特於昨（九）日走訪市警察局保甲處，當承保甲處長願繼武延見，並發表談話如次：</p>
<p>顧氏談話略謂：過去南新併入市區之保甲制度，與今市警察局保甲處所推行制度，情形稍有不同，即有戶籍而言，前南市之戶口，除向警局申報外，且又須向坊公所申報，經此雙重關緊，徒使市民深受跋涉之苦，而在戶口之統計上，尤難會求理想的准確，再如物資配給證之撥付，往往引起市民之不明瞭，增加無謂之蔴煩，如今上述區域既已新併入市區，根據市警察局保甲制度之規例，各警察分局設立保甲股，對於移動申報等各項手續，統由各分局保甲股管理，故今後保甲在市政上之編制，當一實施新的制度，市民不但福利厞淺，而各行政機構之頒發命令，及推行政府綱令，在一元之系統下，利於施行，故以警局之辦理戶口，最符合標准之依據。</p>
<p>因此保甲區域之劃分，根據各該警察分局之範圍，即每一　分局之管鎋聯保，下設各聯各保甲各戶，是項統一之規定，新併市區各區，當同樣作新的劃分，以往之錯綜繁複情形，於今在一統的系統下，交圾明朗之期待，他如自醫團之辦法，亦根據所規定之自警團統一編制，辦法辦理，此點在新併區之警民，將來當同樣的密切配合，在即將成立之自營團團本部督導之下，發展自營本身之效能，此外對於統一收費等一切辦法，南市等新併各區亦統照辦理，總之，在此最新劃分之市區特別區，在保甲上一切辦法，莫不分別切實實施，最後顧處長對荒僻各區，當予以以費之充裕，並增加設備，及自警團員，故南市各新併區域，亦同樣加以各新併區域，變同樣加以充實辦理，期在現行體制下，務使警保得密切之配合。</p>
<h3>防空影片週　圓滿結束</h3>
<p>上海特別市市民防空本部，爲增強市民之防空意識起見，曾於本月四日起至九日止，舉行「防空影片週」，假座文化大戲院，放映各種防空教育影片，執行本市保甲人員，以及防空團團員，免費入內觀覽，茲悉連日前往參觀者，僮極踴躍，不受天時炎熱之影響，且觀覽影片以後，所得之印象其他佳，對於防空種種常識，增進不少，防空本部對此甚表欣慰，上項防空影片週，業於昨（九）日圓滿結束。</p>
<h3>全市戶口米　今日普遍發售　存米登記今日午前截止</h3>
<p>全市戶口米，定今日起一致普遍發售，物品配給處實施存米登記，定今日午前截止，全市民間存米數量，如有企圖規避，以多報少，或隱匿不報，一經查獲，將予沒收，盼市民爲自民利益計，切勿以身試法。</p>
<p>米糧統制委員會前會根據京滬兩市民食米臨時措置綱要，訂定米糧撥入滬市護照之申請，及頒發辦法，公佈施行，茲以新發行將登場，對於十石以上至三百七十五石（三百包）之正式護照，定於本月十五日停止申請及頒發，至十石以下之申請，仍　續辦理。</p>
<h3>短評　學費標准之商權</h3>
<p>本市教育局爲減輕學生家長負擔，同時顧及學校收支相抵起見，聞已訂定下學期公私立學校收費標准。按照目前一般私立學校決定之學費類，大多數超過標准，教育當局是否對超過標准之學校，嚴格糾正，姑置勿論，惟對超過標准徽收學費之學校當局，願進一言。</p>
<p>目前百物購貴，爲教職員之最低生活而提高學費，無可厚非，但以過去之事實而論，各校教職員生活之陷於無法維持者，其最大　結，乃在一部分學校校長，祇知獨善其身，而不知與教職員同甘共苦，盡管教職員之生活無法維持，而校長則可腰纏萬貫。以學費收入作股票交易者有之，以學費收入實行囤貨居奇者有之。因此，往往學費較高之學校，教職員待遇未必較學費較低者爲優，足見學費增加後，學校經濟之增益是一問題，而教職員的生活，是否亦將由是而獲得改善，又是另一問題。</p>
<p>教育是「良心事業」，我們希望一部分身爲校長者勿爲財迷而視教育爲一已賺錢之工具，對於學費之標准，事實上各校各有其不同之環境，或難定其一律之標准，但各校當局應能瞭解增加學生家長負擔即增加失學人數，增加國家民族前途之危機，各求良心之所安，而作最合理的規定。</p>
<h3>觀蔣兆和先生畫展後</h3>
<p>— 綠萍</p>
<p>申報館等爲助學金舉辦的蔣兆和先生畫展，在中國畫苑舉行，展覽日期至十日爲止，筆者冒著炎暑，以一觀爲快的步伐，踏上道西式其外，中式其內的大廈。一進三樓門，就是一幅露半身的人體畫直迫眼臉，他用粗潑的筆觸，爲一個強健的，而只是赤手空拳的年青人造像，那雄偉的姿態，流露著自強之神態，左邊角上題著：「將相本無種，男兒當自強」。那造像正兩眼炯炯地作向前瞭　之狀，給觀衆每一個印象，就是「嶄新的感覺」，要是他提著武器親以適當的淡淡的背景，不更好麽。</p>
<p>流民的大觀</p>
<p>流民　，佈在中間一間屋子裏，畫面的內容，有老小，死傷，仰臥，橫陳斜躺，哀愁悲怨，與驚怕失措，跛足斷手，彷徨饑餓的狀態所構成。流亡者們只是「聽天由命」的神情，大致羅集在那裏，全幅人物數十，積展　張，幾乎佔據全陳列室的全壁，真是洋洋大觀。他如題著：「田園　落千戈後，骨肉流離道路中」，的四個老小不同表情的一幅，以及寫河北省水災，居民出賣自己的兒子時，母親與孩子作悲憐生離情狀的，題著：「生汝如離鳳，年荒值幾錢，此行須尊重，不比阿母邊」等。都是非常撩人思索和推測的畫面。</p>
<p>全部作品，大約不到百幅，構作埋藏，大致都是在五六年以內，幾乎全是墨水淡彩所繪成，，但觀衆並不覺厚樸積素簡單，其中尤以拖著辮發，形態鄙塞畏縮的阿Q爲出色，雖然也是水墨淡彩所寫成，但阿Q的典型形態，似乎與魯迅先生在書本子裏塑的形象還配稱，這大概作者對於小說上的阿Q有相當認識和正確體會。</p>
<p>事實上，古老的中國，大多數人民，本來就在這樣簡陋的中世紀式的環境裏過活，更何況在這個年頭。所以作者並沒有迎合都市里一般勢利者眼光，在敷色與取材上，加以誇張，或抹殺，這就證明作者對於藝術的情感，眼一般自命爲大畫家的僅僅不純在狹隘的對象上的，不能相提並論，他是踏實於自己的週圍，因此他寫下的畫面，幾乎全部是中國北部，故都人民生活的現象。</p>
<p>無疑的艾先生的作品，在用筆用墨和部份題材的技巧上是大大的成功的，他那挺拔潑辣的筆觸，在寥寥幾筆裏面蘊藏著曾經精研細琢的成人，把人物的動態嗈惟妙惟肖的表現出來，沒有一筆多餘，也沒有一筆不夠，他告訴觀衆，他對於個另人物之觀察，既週詳而有心得，用色也恰到好處，這不是一蹴即就而是下過苦功的作者，在此時此地，可以說非常可貴。</p>
<p>中西精筆</p>
<p>蔣先生所構成的畫面，在用筆與敷色的方法上，是以中國畫史上遺傳下來的線條作骨幹，西洋畫的敷色與筆調來做肌肉，正是他在畫冊上的自序裏說挑選中西畫的精筆，混合活用，以構成他自己一派。這些歷史的精美的由祖先遺傳下來的的「國粹」之一的線條，終於被　蔣先生發現而運用至現代的自己的畫面上了，　種作風，在中國近時有徐悲鴻先生，在外國有蘇之「尼古拉.索　洛夫」，以及「庫克立尼克賽」等以及意之查幾亦有類似之筆觸，而畫面純以粗的筆觸，取材純以人物爲對象的，據筆者所知，至此時止似乎很少，這是美術界新　自己園地的一種輪廓之設計，值得時人欣慰，而欲以真正能夠代表中國文化之一的現代「國畫」之希望。</p>
<p>但是，筆者認爲所可異的是全部作品中，人物之神情動態，畫其哀愁，而並沒有激發感覺，在這些獨立的畫面上，又少見襯以有意義的背景，這樣，就只能引起部份的同情和高度的傷感，如果作者把中國人民大衆積極的一面，也表達在畫面上，那末，觀衆贈與的評價，自然會超越作者的想象之外，這是不容否認的。</p>
<p>要是這一點小小的意見，認爲不太不近情理的話，那末，希望在末來的日子裏，有其偉大的作品。這樣也就不僅與作者自序裏：「隨時代而變化」的一　相吻合，而且也就是的確代表時代的畫家了，倡筆者雖然這樣在盼望作者向這方面努力，也許作者早就有此抱負，而只是當此蒸人的炎暑吝嗇罷了。</p>
<p>作者的人生觀</p>
<p>一個作家，不論什麽作家，他有他自己的性格，作風，意識和環境，這蔣先生在他自序裏，也寫的很清楚，用不著筆者辭費。但是因爲繪畫與文字不同，繪畫的具像性比較容易瞭解。因此作品之是否優秀，完全以畫面的內容來給予評價。畫面的內容是作者心目中物象，濁物體的本身，所以好多論者，就拿某人的作品，去衡量某人當時之意識，似乎有充分的理由。大約一個作家之作品所以被　人們　愛，以其作品有著　闊廣大的人生觀，能夠起領導歷史行動的作用，或幫助失去歷史向前時展爲依歸。</p>
<p>在中國　的歷史上，有所謂畫中有詩，詩中有畫的美談，一直傳留到今天，有些畫，的確靠了題名以加強畫面不夠醒人的地方，有的以詩來觀托畫面，有的以畫去表達詩情，但畫表詩情難，詩達畫意易。因爲詩可以運用助詞，動詞，名詞以及衍間字筆以幫助完成懷古，而畫面要用這些就比較困難，有時竟致不可能，因此是要不加思攷，想去畫一幅表達某些人在某些情況或情景中活動的畫件，就更困難了，要是不用背景，那更談不上。蔣先生對於題詞也非當重視，往往用來增加嚴責內容更動人之處，但他作品裏頭有一幅三個苦孩子在一起走，面貌神態不十分像被　的苦兒，也沒有背景，作者就題以「說什麽寶貝心肝，苦兒不值錢」。要不是題這些字，人們也許以爲是舞台上搬下來的啊！然而，觀衆一致指出，作者晨自己的立志上，對於在這許多被生活鞭子所鞭策下的同胞，具著十二分同情的熱忱。</p>
<p>筆者並不認識蔣先生，但相信，而且深信作者一定把自己作畫的週圍更擴展開去，一定能夠替中國人民羣衆寫出不僅可泣而是可歌的畫面，一定爲中國人民呐喊他們都所感到沿未到來的呼聲與動態，而成爲中國偉大的名符其實的畫家。</p>

<h3>After the Fall of Hengyang</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>Question: The U.S.-Chongqing troops exhausted all their efforts to defend Hengyang, but it was finally captured by the Japanese army a few days ago. What impact will this have on the future war situation on the mainland?</p>
<p>Answer: In the war situation on the Chinese mainland, Hengyang is one of the strategic focal points in the decisive stage. The U.S.-Chongqing forces aimed to control Hengyang as a base to shield the southwest and control the southeast, and as the central point of the mainland air force base network for air raids against Japan. Now that Hengyang has fallen, they can neither advance to prepare for the so-called major counter-offensive, nor retreat without losing the vanguard position of their "resistance" base. This will have a significant impact on the future of the U.S.-Chongqing forces.</p>
<p>Question: What is the significance of the Japanese army's occupation of Hengyang?</p>
<p>Answer: This time, the Japanese army's army, navy, and air force closely coordinated to advance the major battle in the border area of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong, and finally occupied Hengyang, completing the initial strategic goal, which is the cornerstone of victory in the decisive battle on the mainland. From then on, the greatest threat to peaceful regions and even air raids on Japan can be lifted; it can advance to open up the Beijing-Hankou and Guangzhou-Hankou railways, promote the full connection of the East Asian mainland railway, and integrate the mainland with Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Question: Then the political significance of this occupation of Hengyang must also be significant, right?</p>
<p>Answer: From then on, the southwestern provinces of Guizhou, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Yunnan have been isolated from the southeastern half of the country east of the Guangzhou-Hankou Railway. The anti-Japanese war zone has been further reduced, and the power of the peaceful zone has been expanded. The result is self-evident. Moreover, from then on, the Japanese army gained the initiative in military and political actions against the Chongqing forces, and the impact on the morale of the people under Chongqing's rule is also not to be ignored.</p>
<p>Question: At a time when the relationship between the U.S. and Chongqing is being adjusted as much as possible, what impact will the fall of Hengyang have on Chongqing's diplomacy?</p>
<p>Answer: First, the United States cannot help but increase its doubts about Chongqing's anti-Japanese strength; second, the Chongqing government and people will also lose faith in the strength of U.S. aid to China, because the U.S. army and air force directly participated in the "defense of Hengyang" this time. Third, the United States is doing its best to mediate the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party. After this military defeat, the future evolution of the situation is also worth noting.</p>
<p>Question: Some people say that the economic significance of the fall of Hengyang is greater than everything else. What do you think?</p>
<p>Answer: "If Hubei and Hunan are productive, the country is well-fed." This refers to the importance of the food production in the two Hunan provinces to the central provinces. Therefore, Hunan has been a strategic location for military strategists since ancient times, especially Hengyang, which is the intersection of the two major railways of Guangzhou-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi. At the same time, it is also the hub of the Hunan-Jiangxi highway and water transportation. In recent years, it has been the material exchange center for the southwestern and southeastern provinces. Whoever obtains it dominates, and whoever loses it is in trouble. The reason is obvious. In addition, the output of military supplies such as chromium and tungsten in the Hengyang area is also considerable, which is especially important in the "total mobilization" during the decisive stage.</p>
<p>Question: What is the future of the war situation on the Chinese mainland?</p>
<p>Answer: This battle of Hengyang is not only a major battle on the Chinese mainland battlefield, but also has important significance for the East Asian war situation. At a time when the U.S. military vainly attempted to advance to the Japanese mainland with the "island-hopping strategy," it mainly relied on the coordinated actions of the mainland air force and the promotion of the mainland military counter-offensive for support. Now that this plan has become a bubble, it will naturally change the Pacific war situation.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government Strengthens Combat Power and Decides to Mobilize Science and Technology; Detailed Rules Announced Yesterday After Presentation</p>
<p>Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to mobilize the efficiency of science and technology and humanities and natural sciences, the Japanese government, on June 7th, formulated an investigation and research project based on the draft outline of the Imperial Order by the National General Mobilization Council. It was decided by the cabinet meeting on the 4th of this month and announced and implemented on the 9th after presentation. The purpose of this Imperial Order is to control investigation and research projects. The full text is divided into seventeen articles. According to Article 5 of the National General Mobilization Law, it stipulates cooperation in investigation and research business. According to Article 13, Paragraph 1 of the law, it stipulates the facility management of investigation and research projects. According to Article 16 of the law, it stipulates the commencement, transfer, abolition, and suspension of investigation and research projects. The general investigation and research institutions other than the scientific and technical institutions for investigation and research are under the guidance and supervision of the Cabinet, and the investigation and research mobilization headquarters appropriately operate them. The Technical Institute is responsible for the operation of scientific and technical research institutions. After the promulgation of this decree, investigation and research, which is the foundation for enhancing Japan's combat power, will have a groundbreaking leap forward.</p>
<h3>Strengthening Female Mobilization</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to cope with the current stage of the decisive battle, the Japanese government once strengthened the mobilization of men in the military and labor circles, and the supply of labor gradually became insufficient. On the one hand, important departments such as coal mines, shipbuilding, iron pots, and national defense construction also gradually need to increase male labor. Therefore, the Japanese government has tried its best to plan to strengthen the mobilization of female labor in order to ensure male labor. The plan has now been drafted. At the cabinet meeting, Minister Hirose Atsushi explained in detail the matters concerning the regulation of the allocation of male workers, and it has been officially decided. The proposal will thoroughly strengthen female mobilization. At the same time, it will also restrict the employment of male employees and replace them with female employees in due course, and transfer male employees to other important departments in order to adapt to the allocation of labor, and to put the total labor force of men and women into the full-scale combat configuration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Elite Troops Sweep Away Remnants of Chongqing Troops Around Hengyang; U.S. Air Force Completely Defeated in Chinese Mainland</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: The U.S.-Chongqing Allied Forces tried their best to defend the important town of Hengyang, but it finally fell on the 8th. The Japanese army in Hunan Province, after capturing Changsha, immediately advanced southward along the Guangzhou-Hankou Line, approaching the outer perimeter of Hengyang. On June 26th, it occupied the airfield on the opposite bank of Hengyang City, and on the 28th, it completed the encirclement of Hengyang. In the past four weeks, the Japanese army surrounded Hengyang City with a portion of its forces, and annihilated the Chongqing Field Army in the east and west areas of the Xiangjiang River with its main force,迎击企冈解救衡阳之渝第九第六两战区军，并继续展开歼灭战.敵美鑑於衡陽在軍事上之重要性，爲堅守該市計，特　勵渝軍作戰，同時蔣介石氏亦因衡陽若一旦失陷，將予重廳政權以致命打擊，故命令部下死守. In view of the military importance of Hengyang, the enemy U.S. forces encouraged the Chongqing troops to fight in order to defend the city. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek also ordered his subordinates to defend the city to the death, because if Hengyang were to fall, it would deal a fatal blow to the Chongqing regime. In order to defend the city, the operational instructors of the U.S. and enemy armies guided the defense operations, and at the same time mobilized the U.S. Air Force to do their best to cover Hengyang. Therefore, the number of planes flying over the battlefield every day has reached more than 100. During the second Changsha campaign in January of the 31st year of the Republic of China, Fang Xianjue, the commander of the 10th Army and the defense commander of Changsha, won the title of anti-Japanese hero with false propaganda. This time, in the Hengyang campaign, he personally led about four divisions to defend the city, relying on air supplies from outside and reinforcements from the periphery, resisting stubbornly. After the elite Japanese army annihilated the Chongqing Field Army, they began to prepare to attack the city. At dusk on August 4th, with the cooperation of the air force, they launched a general attack, and in three and a half days, they annihilated the four divisions of the Chongqing army in the city. At 8:08 a.m. on August 8th, they completely occupied Shuyang. This was the 41st day since the attack was launched. The Japanese army is still sweeping away the Chongqing Field Army around Hengyang.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: After the fall of Hengyang, Chinese officials and civilians believe that it will have a great impact not only militarily, but also economically and politically. Although the future actions of the Japanese army cannot be predicted, the past several Hunan campaigns have been a series of battles. It can also be understood that after the Japanese army controls Hengyang and Changsha, not only will the obstacles to new military operations on the Guangzhou-Hankou and Hunan-Guangxi lines be eliminated in the future, but also important materials such as antimony and tung oil exported to the United States economically will fall into the hands of the Japanese army. After the Japanese army maintains Hunan Province, the lives of the people under the rule of the National Government of Shanghai and Nanjing will become more stable, and the benefits that the Shanghai financial community will receive in the future are quite promising.</p>
<p>Enemy U.S. Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: Japanese aircraft fought with the U.S. Air Force over the Hengyang war zone. Since the Japanese army occupied the Hengyang airfield in late June, the Chongqing troops guarding Hengyang have continued to resist and have been ordered to defend the city to the death. This move was made at the request of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. Because if the Japanese aircraft can fly freely over Hengyang, Guilin will become a completely forward base, and the forward bases of Suichuan, Jianchang, and Yushan will also be completely isolated and helpless. Therefore, the U.S. Air Force made this request, and at the same time, with all the efforts it had made in the past, it cooperated with the Chongqing troops and poured all its air force to counterattack. Therefore, the number of U.S. and Chongqing aircraft operating on the Hunan front has reached more than 2,000. They repeatedly attacked the Japanese army's rear supply line day and night, and blindly bombed the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force for four weeks since June, fighting each other to the death for the defense of Hengyang. The most intense of these was the supply war launched by both sides in the air against Hengyang. As for the fall of Hengyang, it can be said that the U.S. Air Force has completely failed in the Japanese-U.S. air battle. At this point, the air war on the Chinese mainland has entered a landmark stage. The future air war is the advancement of the Japanese Air Force base and the launch of a new air war.</p>
<p>Pingxiang and Liling Expand the Results of the Battle</p>
<p>A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in the Pingxiang and Liling areas is still continuing to carry out annihilation battles, and is thoroughly sweeping away the defeated Chongqing army in the vicinity. Since the 2nd, in the Baizhu area (about 40 kilometers south of Liling), they have continued to carry out a heroic annihilation battle against the remaining main force of the 72nd Army of Chongqing. The Chongqing army in this area is the 34th Division of the 72nd Army. The mountains around Baizhu are steep and the dense forests continue, so the Japanese army attacking continuously is extremely difficult. At this moment, the Japanese army is gradually shortening the encirclement and attacking the Chongqing army's positions everywhere, expanding the results of the battle.</p>
<p>The Morale of the Chongqing Troops is Low</p>
<p>Central News Agency: A student who recently fled here from Chongqing stated regarding the dynamics of the people in Chongqing that recently, if two or more young students in Chongqing gather together to discuss the reasons for this defeat, they all vehemently denounce the decadence of Chongqing. They strongly criticize the weakness of the Chongqing army, which loses every battle, and the U.S. army's empty words of assistance. The reasons for Chongqing's defeat that they pointed out are mostly the following: The front-line troops have been stationed in one area for a long time, resulting in low morale. The commanders of the stationed troops routinely collude with the local people to enrich their own pockets, so the soldiers naturally imitate them, and military discipline is therefore relaxed. The supply of weapons and ammunition to the Chongqing army is not smooth, and the results of U.S.-style training are not as good as they are advertised. Soldiers receive 180 yuan per month, which is difficult to maintain any life. Due to the exploitation of the people by the army, the separation between the army and the people is very deep. Regarding the above four points, the Chongqing authorities shirk their responsibility, saying that the defeat of Chongqing is due to the inadequacy of British and American aid. The strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is weak, making it difficult to prevent the Japanese army from attacking. The British and American armies and advisory groups, shamelessly, said that there was no need to defend Changsha and Luoyang to the death. The fall of Hengyang this time may also say that there is no way to defend it to the death, and vigorously avoid the responsibility for the defeat. In order to protect the lives and property of all the people, they retreated. The combat power is all used to shirk responsibility, and they have fallen into an atmosphere of attack and critical illness among the youth.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks Leizhou Peninsula</h3>
<p>A certain base on the Chinese Front, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese army in the Leizhou Peninsula is advancing every day with the mutual cooperation of the army. The Japanese dive bomber team, at dawn on the 2nd, fiercely bombed the fortifications of the Chongqing army's frontal positions on the Matouling, 10 kilometers north of Suixi, as well as the Chongqing army gathered near Liangdongxu, 10 kilometers east of the area. On the 5th, they again bombed the Chongqing army near Chiling, 8 kilometers northwest of Liangdongxu. At dawn on the 4th, in response to the attack on Lianjiang by the ground troops, they bombed the Chongqing army's positions on the highlands north of the area. The Japanese ground troops attacked along the trails, inflicting heavy damage on the Chongqing army. The area is very close to Danzhu, the mobile base of the Chongqing-U.S. Air Force, but there is no trace of the enemy, indicating that the enemy's air force has been weakened.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel North to Discuss Material Exchange; Fuel Problem Expected to be Solved</h3>
<p>Nanjing, September 9th, Central News Agency: In order to ensure an abundant supply of materials, smooth material exchange between the north and the south, and to dredge the source of coal in central China to solve the difficulties of power raw materials and fuel, the Ministry of Industry decided to send Tao Guoxian, director of the Commercial Affairs Department of the ministry, to the north to discuss countermeasures with relevant parties in North China. Tao has already gone north on a mission a few days ago and has begun discussions with relevant parties. It is predicted that after this contact, problems such as the exchange of materials between the north and the south and the source of coal will be solved easily.</p>

<h3>First Phase of Governance and Transport Project Expected to Start Construction in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Nanjing, September 9th, Central News Agency: After the Governance and Transport Canal Engineering Bureau solicited bids for the first phase of the Governance and Transport project, it decided that the Sino-Japanese Xingnan Company won the bid. It is learned that the contract for the project has been signed. The company's regular bureau has sent personnel to the construction site to plan all the preparations for the start of construction, and it is expected to start construction on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombing Yellow River Bridge Shot Down</h3>
<p>Beijing, September 9th, Central News Agency: Two P25 aircraft of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the vicinity of the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Line on the 3rd. Due to the obstruction of anti-aircraft fire from the Japanese army's ground troops, they blindly dropped bombs and fled. One of them crashed near Guanzijie (35 kilometers southwest of Luoyang) due to being hit by bullets. The wreckage of the aircraft and the bodies of the pilots have been discovered by the Japanese army's guard team.</p>
<h3>Japanese General Araki Talks About the Essence of Modern Warfare</h3>
<p>Tokyo, September 9th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Toyo Culture Summer University has started as usual in Karuizawa since the 7th. There are Japanese, Europeans, people from various parts of the Co-prosperity Sphere, and Indians listening to the lectures. On the first day (7th), Baron Araki Sadao, a general, lectured on the essence of modern warfare with the theme of the purpose of war. In particular, the general explained the meaning of "Wu" as follows: In the British and American war methods, there is quite a bit of interest. "Wu," although only regarded as militarism, is now generally referred to as "Wu," which is completely different from the concept of militarism. Japanese people use the Japanese sword method to best express the spirit of "Wu." Japanese soldiers will never use the Japanese sword to commit innocent massacres, or simply defend themselves and cause useless bloodshed. Therefore, they always move their swords to uphold justice, that is, Japan is seeking world peace so that all mankind can obtain what they deserve, and wield its righteous sword. Therefore, the purpose of the Great East Asian War has always been based on the traditional spirit of Bushido.</p>
<p>Director of the Information Department Izubuchi Talks About the Hengyang Capture Battle; The Japanese Army Will Occupy an Extremely Favorable Advantage in the Future</p>
<p>Yesterday, Director of the Information Department Izubuchi of the Japanese Army Department held a regular press conference at the Cathay Hotel and made the following remarks regarding the fall of Hengyang: The director first said that Hengyang, which Chongqing and Chiang relied on as a copper wall, was finally captured by the Japanese army yesterday (8th). The fall of Hengyang has given a thorough and major blow to the strategic situation of the U.S. Air Force and the Chongqing army stationed in Chongqing in the future. Hengyang is an important place in Hunan in terms of politics and economy. The Japanese army's capture of the area this time occupies an extremely favorable advantage in any aspect of the attack in the future. Therefore, the fall of Hengyang this time has caused heavy and huge losses in both spirit and material to the Chongqing side, especially those suffered by the U.S.-Chongqing forces, which are major and fatal.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Plan Becomes a Bubble</p>
<p>The following is a detailed description: First, the U.S. military, which intends to use the Chongqing side's combat power and mainland bases to encircle the Japanese army from the mainland, has completely turned into a bubble due to the capture of Hengyang this time. Second, the fall of Hengyang also determines the entire fate of Hunan, the treasure house of China. In particular, it is completely impossible for the U.S. to grab Hunan's rich mineral resources in Chongqing. Third, after the Hengyang airfield becomes the Japanese Air Force base in the future, the important areas that the U.S. Air Force in Central and South China rely on as the heart will be lost, and the U.S. military that uses the Chinese mainland will be completely unable to restore its power and fall into a desperate situation.</p>
<p>The Result of Being an Appendage to Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The director also said that in the Hengyang capture battle, the Japanese army annihilated four divisions of the Chongqing army, which is the result that the British and American Air Force should have obtained. The Imperial Government has repeatedly stated that those who refuse to cooperate with Britain and the United States, even the Chongqing army, are not the enemy of the Japanese army, let alone the people. The Japanese army's capture of Hengyang and other places in the past was all based on this spirit and was successfully completed. In this Hengyang and other battlefield, the Chongqing army annihilated by the Japanese army is, in terms of the nature of the army, truly Chongqing, and can be said to be the appendage army of the U.S. military. The Japanese army attacked Hengyang for more than a month. The enemy in Hengyang has indeed tried its best to fight, and its cooperation with the U.S. military can also be said to be close. Unfortunately, this kind of effort only helps the ambition of the United States and Britain to invade East Asia and sacrifice China. It does not make any contribution to the East Asian nation. To the majority of the Chongqing army who sacrificed in the Hengyang battlefield, their bravery is admirable, but their foolishness and misjudgment of the country are regrettable and deplorable, and I feel infinite sympathy.</p>

<h3>Main Culprits in Military Treason Case; Eight Executed by Hanging Yesterday; German Official Announcement of Court Trial Process</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The Berlin People's Court sentenced eight main culprits in the July 20th coup to death. Last night, an official announcement was made stating: "The Great German People's Court interrogated eight traitors who participated in the July 20th crime on the 7th and 8th. The criminals have been expelled from the military, including: Wieselerben, Hopner, Steve Haas, Bernardis, Krausing, Wartenburg, and Hagen. They were sentenced to death for treason and their property was confiscated. Two hours after the verdict, the defendants were executed by hanging.</p>
<p>Details of the Trial Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The trial of the eight main culprits who assassinated the German leader was held in the Prussian Supreme Court. The outside world did not know about the trial beforehand, so there were no crowds outside the courthouse, nor were there any police officers on alert. However, at the entrance of the courtroom, the listening permits were strictly checked. The courtroom was rectangular in shape and simply furnished with busts of Frederick the Great and the German leader. There were five windows on the wall, which were wide open due to the hot weather.</p>
<p>Three banners with the "卍" symbol were hung in the center of the hall. The presiding judge of the People's Court, Franzlou, sat in the center. On either side of the long table were the infantry general Nagger and the court adviser Laimer, who were the jury members. Opposite the wall were two seats for the eight defendant lawyers, all wearing black uniforms. Behind them were two rows of benches for the defendants. A policeman sat between each defendant to separate them. The seats of the prosecutors were also on the opposite wall. The seats for newspaper reporters and stenographers were on the table in front of the defendants, followed by the seats for photographers. Approximately 200 people attended as listeners, including military and National Socialist Party officials and civilians. Because the evidence was conclusive, each defendant confessed to their crimes in the shortest time. Therefore, the trial proceeded extremely smoothly.</p>
<h3>General Offensive Begins in Normandy and Brittany; Germany Tries to Prevent Enemy from Advancing Inland</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News: The situation in the northwestern France war zone remains undecided. The anti-Axis forces are trying to maintain their initiative and expand their occupied areas as much as possible. The German army is able to operate more freely to implement its countermeasures. The focus of the German counter-offensive is not in Brittany, but in the interior of France, because there is a large concentration of reserve troops in the area, which is more predictable. Because it is very difficult for large armies to move to Brittany, the German army allows the national troops in the area to resist on their own. The U.S. armored columns that drove straight into the peninsula have been blocked near Saint-Malo, Brest, Lorient, and Saint-Nazaire. In Normandy and the lower Loire River, the U.S. Third Army, which advanced eastward and southeastward, has slowed down after making some progress. The main force of the army is still along the Mayenne River, and its vanguard is attacking the Sarthe River in Versailles. The fighting in Normandy is still fierce. The right wing of the U.S. First Army between the upper reaches of the Seiron River and the West River encountered a partial counter-offensive by the German army. Although the enemy army had the cover of a superior air force, it was unable to stop the German counter-offensive. The German armored columns advanced several kilometers westward. North of the West River, the U.S. military, which was advancing eastward in the Selins and Saint-Poix area, continued to exert pressure, but gained very little. Other units of the army penetrated deep into the German positions from Vire, and fierce fighting is currently underway. The British Second Army attacked the new German defense line between Vire and Tullehacourt, but the scale was not large. There is still a major battle between Tullehacourt and Poulet. The British army attacked eastward, occupied the city of Grimbasque after crossing the Aunay River. The initial German counter-attack was able to drive the enemy back to the banks of the Aunay River. The enemy then mobilized a large number of reinforcements and re-entered the city of Grimbasque and its surrounding forests. There is still a battle for control there. The Canadian army's frontal attack on the line failed. On Monday, the enemy intensified pressure on the area and between the Aunay and Caen-Falaise highways.</p>
<h3>Enemy Invades Montciel and Advances Toward Paris</h3>
<p>Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: German News: A German official war report stated that fierce fighting broke out in the Montciel area (LeMaus in the southeast of the Cotentin Peninsula), and the enemy has invaded the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 9th, Central News Agency: According to front-line reports, the U.S. military on the Normandy front is attacking towards Dinan from Avranches, and has reached Harlandson Hillmans, advancing towards Paris.</p>
<h3>Churchill Inspects Normandy Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, September 9th, Central News Agency: Haitong News, London News: After the anti-Axis forces began to attack the European continent, British Prime Minister Churchill inspected Normandy for the third time. The trip was very short. General Montgomery and General Bradley reported to Churchill on the latest war situation.</p>
<h3>Finnish Cabinet Reorganized - Hackzell Appointed Prime Minister</h3>

<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports that after the Anti-Axis forces attempted a small-scale sudden attack on the north bank of the Arno River at the end of the week, aiming to establish a bridgehead but failing, Monday's fighting was limited to artillery battles and reconnaissance activities.

<h3>Heavy Fighting on Two Focal Points of Eastern Front - Battle for Warsaw Begins in Suburbs</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency telegram) - Reuters reports that Soviet pressure remained on two focal points of the Eastern Front today. The Soviet army is using large forces in combat, and the German army's resistance continues to be strong, launching counterattacks from time to time. In the south, the Soviet army is concentrated in the Vistula River bend, and in the north, they are advancing towards the East Prussian border. The enemy is now sending large forces across the Vistula River in an attempt to capture Warsaw from the west bank of the river. In Baranow, ten divisions of infantry and four tank brigades penetrated the German lines for several hundred meters before being stopped. Five divisions of Soviet infantry launched an offensive south of Warsaw. Their numerical superiority initially achieved some gains, but after a German surprise attack on their right flank, they had to reduce their pressure. The focus of the Soviet offensive in East Prussia is northwest of Kaunas in Lithuania. In that area, the enemy deployed nine divisions of infantry and two tank brigades, penetrating the German lines. Hundreds of German aircraft assisted in the counterattack, completely filling the gap. The Soviet offensive towards Riga in the Bauska-Bauske region has been suppressed, and fighting is still ongoing in the areas penetrated by the Soviet army.</p>

In Warsaw, the German garrison in the city of Warsaw and Polish guerrillas engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs, with the German army achieving a complete victory. In East Prussia, German forces in Wirballen launched a fierce counterattack, sealing off the Soviet breakthrough and defeating a strong Soviet force in the north.</p>

<h3>Mainland Air War Situation - US Air Force Activity in Chongqing Obstructed</h3>
<p>On the morning of July 13th, the aviation fortress of Guilin, an advance base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, was bombed. A total of eighty-nine enemy aircraft caught fire and were destroyed. The Japanese bombers that achieved this remarkable feat were meticulously manufactured aircraft. The engines, wings, and even every small nail embodied the precious spirit of wartime industrial warriors. Thinking of this, these aircraft are truly worthy of respect. The following is a report on how these aircraft are active on the mainland front:</p>
<p>These bombers were dispatched at night to bomb the U.S. Air Force base stationed in Chongqing, achieving remarkable results each time. Since July, nineteen aircraft were destroyed in Zhijiang, Hunan Province on the 3rd, eight aircraft were destroyed in Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province on the 7th, twenty-eight aircraft were destroyed in Guilin on the 9th, fifty-one aircraft were destroyed in Zhijiang again on the 12th, and eighty-nine aircraft were destroyed in Guilin on the 13th. Summarizing the overall results since January of this year, more than 400 enemy aircraft have caught fire and been destroyed. None of the enemy's major bases scattered across the mainland have escaped the night raids of Japanese bombers.</p>
<p>These bombers were also used to pursue, immediately bomb, and retaliate against the American B24 aircraft that raided Kitakyushu on June 16th. In night air combat, they never get lost and can always reach their destination accurately to bomb it. The enemy aircraft at the base are enemy aircraft waiting to invade the Japanese mainland. Destroying these enemy aircraft means preventing air raids on the mainland. Thanks to the bombers and fighters fighting together on the mainland, the enemy feels very threatened, and the Japanese mainland can rest easy. Often, one aircraft destroys dozens of enemy aircraft, so the presence of one Japanese aircraft prevents dozens of enemy air raids on the mainland. In this sense, all industrial warriors across the country! Please build more aircraft and send them to the front. The air force on the mainland, forgetting their own achievements, only expresses its sincere gratitude and waits for you to manufacture more excellent aircraft and send more aircraft to the front.</p>
<p>A certain unit commander's change</p>
<p>I talked with a unit commander at a press conference and learned about the situation of the mainland air war. The following is a record of it:</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the significance of our current operations?</p>
<p>Unit Commander: In order to carry out its mission, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing selected a base for air raids on Japan in the eastern military region of China. In the vast area east of Guilin, countless air fortresses are being built. Our army, without waiting for its completion, preemptively began the operation to crush this attempt. The arrogant enemy is withdrawing its frontal armies from the southeast and northern fronts, focusing its main forces on the Kunming-Chongqing line, and scattering a strong mobile force in the bases of Guilin, Zhijiang, Danzhu, and Liuzhou, observing the gaps in our front line, and rapidly building central and northwestern bases as B29 launch points to once again invade Kitakyushu. The enemy's plan above, their strategy in mainland China, is a constant wave operation, that is, relying on a long period of wave-like fluctuations and attempting to make the waves rise higher and higher. Our unit uses quality and spiritual strength to confront the overwhelming material strength of the enemy, and under careful planning, carries out operations without interruption.</p>
<p>Reporter: How is the air power of both sides in China?</p>
<p>Unit Commander: For quantity, a certain limited amount is absolutely necessary. We have very little quantity, but that is enough. However, the soldiers' hope is to ask for more aircraft. Now, in view of the war situation in various aspects and the situation in the rear, the soldiers no longer make this request, but would rather use their boiling fighting spirit and qualitative excellence to make up for their shortcomings.</p>
<p>Reporter: What about the enemy situation in the future?</p>
<p>Unit Commander: Even if our side continues to achieve great victories, they are not to be despised. American aircraft will stubbornly advance to attack the bases in the northwest. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, July 18)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Welfare Recruiting Laborers</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan of the National Government ordered the Ministry of Social Welfare to actively recruit laborers. In addition to sending personnel to Shanghai to recruit, personnel have also been sent to the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas of Jiangbei. The recruited laborers are intended to be assigned to various mines and factories to work hard to increase production, especially coal miners, which are most needed. If coal production increases, Shanghai's electricity and tap water problems can be easily solved. The treatment for coal miners recruited this time is very generous. Those who bring their families to work together or join the group are very welcome. In addition, mine foremen who transport laborers are also very much needed, and their treatment is roughly the same as that of miners. Shanghai workers who are interested in the north or unemployed workers are requested to go to the following locations: No. 200 Yongkang Road (Remi Road), Shanghai Special City Vocational Guidance Center; Tianhouyu Bridge, Shanghai Special City Social Welfare Bureau; Social Insurance Bureau at the intersection of North Henan Road on Wujin Road (Target Road); No. 69 Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai Enthusiastically Donate Money</h3>

This shows the Chinese people's determination to carry out the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<h3>Director Gu of the Baojia Bureau Discusses Baojia Administration: Unifying the Baojia System Throughout the City</h3>
<p>Since the unification of municipal police administration in this city, the baojia system throughout the city has also been moving towards unification. In the future, the connection between police and baojia will increasingly demonstrate the establishment of a new form. A Central News Agency reporter, in order to understand the police and baojia situation in the newly merged areas of the city, visited the Baojia Bureau of the Municipal Police Department yesterday (the 9th). There, Director Gu Baojia, Yuan Jiwu, granted an interview and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>Director Gu stated in brief: In the past, the baojia system in the southern districts newly incorporated into the city differed slightly from the system promoted by the current Baojia Bureau of the Municipal Police Department. Specifically, in terms of household registration, the population in the former southern city was required to report not only to the police station but also to the neighborhood public office. This dual requirement caused citizens to suffer the hardship of making multiple trips, and made it difficult to achieve ideal accuracy in population statistics. Furthermore, the distribution of material rationing certificates often caused confusion among citizens and increased unnecessary troubles. Now that the aforementioned areas have been newly incorporated into the city, according to the regulations of the baojia system of the Municipal Police Department, each police precinct will establish a baojia section. All procedures, including mobile registration, will be managed by the baojia sections of each precinct. Therefore, the incorporation of baojia into the municipal administration will implement a new system. Citizens will not only enjoy superficial benefits, but the issuance of orders by various administrative agencies and the implementation of government guidelines will be facilitated under a unified system. Therefore, the police bureau's handling of household registration is the most standard basis.</p>
<p>Therefore, the division of baojia areas is based on the scope of each police precinct. Each precinct's jurisdiction includes a joint bao, which is further divided into various baos, jias, and households. This unified regulation will apply equally to the newly incorporated areas of the city, and a new division will be made. The complicated and complex situation of the past is now expected to be clarified under a unified system. Other matters, such as the self-defense corps, will also be handled according to the unified organization and methods of the self-defense corps as stipulated. The police and civilians in the newly incorporated areas will cooperate closely in the future. Under the guidance of the soon-to-be-established headquarters of the self-defense corps, the effectiveness of self-defense itself will be developed. In addition, all measures, such as unified fee collection, will be implemented in the newly incorporated areas such as the southern city. In short, in this newly divided special area of the city, all measures related to baojia will be implemented separately and effectively. Finally, Director Gu stated that he will provide sufficient funds to the remote areas and increase equipment and self-defense corps members. Therefore, the newly incorporated areas in the southern city will also be similarly strengthened and managed, in order to ensure close cooperation between the police and baojia under the current system.</p>
<h3>Air Defense Film Week Successfully Concluded</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Citizen Air Defense Headquarters, in order to enhance citizens' awareness of air defense, held an "Air Defense Film Week" from the 4th to the 9th of this month. Various air defense education films were screened at the Cultural Grand Theater, and baojia personnel and members of the air defense corps in this city were admitted free of charge. It is reported that a large number of people went to visit every day, unaffected by the hot weather. Moreover, the impressions gained after watching the films were very good, and they gained a lot of knowledge about various aspects of air defense. The Air Defense Headquarters expressed great satisfaction with this. The aforementioned Air Defense Film Week was successfully concluded yesterday (the 9th).</p>
<h3>Citywide Household Rice Universally Sold Today, Registration of Rice Stockpile Ends This Morning</h3>
<p>Citywide household rice will be universally sold starting today. The registration of rice stockpiles implemented by the Materials Allocation Office will end this morning. If the quantity of rice stored by the entire civilian population is intentionally evaded, underreported, or concealed, it will be confiscated upon discovery. It is hoped that citizens will not take the risk of breaking the law for the sake of their own interests.</p>
<p>The Rice Control Committee previously formulated and announced the application for and issuance of passports for rice entering Shanghai, based on the temporary measures for rice for civilian consumption in Beijing and Shanghai. Now that the new issuance is about to begin, the application for and issuance of formal passports for ten stones or more up to 375 stones (300 bags) will be suspended on the 15th of this month. Applications for ten stones or less will continue to be processed.</p>
<h3>Short Comment: The Business Right of Tuition Standards</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau, in order to reduce the burden on students' parents and at the same time take into account the balance of school income and expenses, has reportedly formulated tuition standards for public and private schools for the next semester. According to the tuition categories determined by most private schools at present, most of them exceed the standards. Whether the education authorities will strictly correct schools that exceed the standards is still up for debate, but I would like to say a word to the school authorities who charge tuition fees that exceed the standards.</p>
<p>At present, the price of everything is expensive, and it is understandable to increase tuition fees to ensure the minimum living standards of teachers and staff. However, based on past facts, the biggest reason why the lives of teachers and staff in various schools have become unsustainable is that some school principals only know how to take care of themselves and do not share the joys and sorrows with teachers and staff. Even though the lives of teachers and staff cannot be maintained, the principals can be very rich. Some use tuition income for stock trading, and some use tuition income to hoard goods for profit. Therefore, the treatment of teachers and staff in schools with higher tuition fees is not necessarily better than that in schools with lower tuition fees. This shows that increasing school fees is one matter, and whether the lives of teachers and staff will also be improved as a result is another matter.</p>
<p>Education is a "conscience undertaking." We hope that some principals will not be obsessed with money and regard education as a tool for making money for themselves. In fact, each school has its own different circumstances regarding tuition standards, and it may be difficult to set a uniform standard. However, the school authorities should understand that increasing the burden on students' parents means increasing the number of students who drop out of school, which increases the crisis of the future of the nation. They should seek peace of mind and make the most reasonable regulations.</p>

<p>— Green Duckweed</p>
<p>The Jiang Zhaohe Painting Exhibition, organized by Shenbao and others for scholarships, is being held at the Chinese Painting Academy. The exhibition will last until the 10th. The author braved the sweltering heat and stepped into the building, which is Western in its exterior but Chinese in its interior, with a quick glance. As soon as you enter the door on the third floor, you are confronted with a half-body portrait of a human figure. He uses rough brushstrokes to create a portrait of a strong young man who is only bare-handed. The majestic posture reveals a spirit of self-improvement. In the upper left corner, it is inscribed: "Generals and ministers are not born into it, men should be self-reliant." The portrait is staring forward with bright eyes, giving every viewer the impression of a "brand new feeling." Wouldn't it be better if he was holding a weapon with an appropriately light background?</p>
<p>A Grand View of Refugees</p>
<p>Refugees are displayed in the middle room. The content of the painting includes old and young, dead and wounded, lying supine, lying horizontally and diagonally, sorrow and resentment, and the state of being frightened and at a loss, limping and broken hands, wandering and hungry. The refugees only have an expression of "resigning themselves to fate." There are dozens of figures in the entire painting, filling the entire exhibition room, truly a grand spectacle. Other paintings include one depicting four old and young people with different expressions, titled: "After the war, the fields are desolate, and relatives are displaced on the road," as well as one depicting the flood in Hebei Province, when residents sold their sons, and the mother and child were in a state of sorrowful parting, titled: "Giving birth to you is like parting from a phoenix, how much is it worth in a year of famine? You must respect this journey, not like being by your mother's side," etc. All are very thought-provoking and speculative pictures.</p>
<p>The entire collection consists of less than a hundred works, mostly composed and buried within the past five or six years, almost all painted with ink and light colors. However, the audience does not feel that it is simple. Among them, A Q, who drags his pigtail and has a humble and timid appearance, is particularly outstanding. Although it is also written with ink and light colors, A Q's typical form seems to match the image shaped by Mr. Lu Xun in the book. This is probably because the author has a considerable understanding and correct understanding of A Q in the novel.</p>
<p>In fact, most of the people in ancient China originally lived in such a simple medieval environment, let alone in this year. Therefore, the author did not cater to the eyes of the general snobs in the city, and exaggerated or erased the colors and materials. This proves that the author's feelings for art are not only narrow on the objects that are self-proclaimed as great painters, and cannot be compared. He is down-to-earth in his surroundings, so the pictures he wrote are almost all the phenomena of life of the people in northern China, the ancient capital.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, Mr. Ai's works are greatly successful in the techniques of using pen and ink and some subjects. His upright and bold brushstrokes contain the adults who have carefully studied and refined them in a few strokes, and vividly express the dynamics of the characters. There is no stroke too much, and there is no stroke not enough. He tells the audience that his observation of individual characters is both detailed and insightful, and the color is also just right. This is not an author who has achieved success overnight, but has worked hard. At this time and place, it can be said to be very valuable.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Fine Pens</p>
<p>The pictures composed by Mr. Jiang are based on the lines inherited from Chinese painting history as the skeleton, and the colors and strokes of Western painting are used as the muscles. It is precisely what he said in his preface to the album that he selected the fine pens of Chinese and Western paintings, mixed them and used them flexibly to form his own school. These historical and exquisite lines inherited from the ancestors are one of the "national quintessence". Finally, Mr. Jiang discovered and applied them to his modern paintings. This style has Mr. Xu Beihong in modern China, and Su's "Nikolai Solokov" and "Kukryniksy" in foreign countries, as well as Zha Ji of Italy, also have similar strokes, and the pictures are purely rough strokes, and the subjects are purely characters. As far as the author knows, there seem to be very few so far. This is a kind of outline design for the new self-cultivation of the art world, which is worthy of the joy of the world, and wants to be a modern "national painting" that can truly represent Chinese culture.</p>
<p>However, what the author thinks is strange is that in all the works, the expressions and dynamics of the characters are painted with sorrow, but they do not arouse feelings. In these independent paintings, there are few meaningful backgrounds. In this way, it can only arouse some sympathy and a high degree of sadness. If the author also expresses the positive side of the Chinese people on the screen, then the evaluation given by the audience will naturally exceed the author's imagination, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>If this little opinion is considered not too unreasonable, then I hope that in the future, there will be great works. In this way, it will not only coincide with the one sentence in the author's preface: "Change with the times", but also be a painter who truly represents the times. Although the author is hoping that the author will work hard in this direction, perhaps the author has already had this ambition, but he is just stingy in this steaming heat.</p>
<p>The Author's Outlook on Life</p>
<p>A writer, no matter what kind of writer, has his own personality, style, consciousness and environment. Mr. Jiang also wrote this very clearly in his preface, and there is no need for the author to spend his words. But because painting is different from writing, the imageability of painting is easier to understand. Therefore, whether a work is excellent or not is entirely evaluated by the content of the painting. The content of the painting is the image of the object in the author's mind, the turbidity of the object itself, so many commentators use someone's work to measure someone's consciousness at that time, which seems to be fully justified. The reason why a writer's work is loved by people is that his work has a broad outlook on life, which can play a role in leading historical actions, or help to return to the historical forward development.</p>
<p>In the history of China, there is a beautiful story of poetry in painting and painting in poetry, which has been passed down to this day. Some paintings do rely on the title to strengthen the lack of eye-catching places in the painting, some use poetry to set off the painting, and some use painting to express poetic feelings, but it is difficult to paint to express poetic feelings, and it is easy to use poetry to express painting ideas. Because poetry can use auxiliary words, verbs, nouns, and derivative words to help complete the nostalgia, it is more difficult to use these in the picture, and sometimes it is even impossible. Therefore, it is even more difficult to want to draw a painting that expresses the activities of some people in some situations or scenes without thinking, and if you don't use the background, it is even more impossible. Mr. Jiang also attaches great importance to inscriptions, often using them to increase the touching places of strict content, but there is a picture of three suffering children walking together in his works, and the appearance and expression are not very like the suffering children who have been beaten, and there is no background. The author inscribed "What about treasures and hearts, suffering children are worthless." If it weren't for these words, people might think it was moved from the stage! However, the audience unanimously pointed out that the author's own ambition is to have a warm enthusiasm for the compatriots who are whipped by the whip of life.</p>
<p>The author does not know Mr. Jiang, but he believes and deeply believes that the author will definitely expand the surroundings of his painting, and will definitely write out not only moving but also singable pictures for the Chinese people, and will definitely shout out the calls and dynamics that all Chinese people feel have not yet arrived, and become a great and well-deserved painter in China.</p>
