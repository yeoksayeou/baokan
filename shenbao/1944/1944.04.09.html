<h3 id="c1">天下興亡匹夫有責　—敬吿我的中國好朋友— <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— 船津辰一郞</p>
<p>昨天申報社評，論「切莫偷懶」，期待政府多替國家做事，多替人民謀福利。勉勵人民貢獻一切力量，多替國家社會做事。誠然，國家是整個集團，人民是整個集團中的構成份子，要求整個集團發生力量，當然基於構成份子的各個努力。所以，一個國家的國民，希望國家有力量，希望國家復典强盛，就須首先認淸是每個國民自己的義務，同都不能放棄賣任。如果國民放棄了本位對國家的資任，那末，國家整個的力量就趨於脆弱，漸致衰亡，這個時候，國民的命運，當然陷於悲慘的境地。所謂「皮之不存，毛將焉附」，我想眞誠愛國的國民，一定會很淸楚認識這裏的關鍵。換句話說，如果一個國民，不能脚踏實地貢獻一切力量，克盡對國家的義務，担起對國家的責任，而自詡為愛國，期望國家復興强盛，那末，試問誰來担果，不但不是愛國，簡直足以誤國，中國歷下興亡，匹夫有資」，這兩句話，具體說明了每個國民都有對於國家的責任。顧炎武先生是中國國民所崇拜的，尤其是知識階級而自詡為愛國者，都知道這兩句話的精神，那末，就應該絕對的遵守這種指示。</p>
<p>我來中國已有五十六年，中國猶如我的第二故鄕，最愛中國。因此，我不是推譽日段，將日本國民和中國國民衡量一下，老實說，日本國民對於國家責任感，比較中國國民普遍而熱烈。當然，中國國民對於國家有高度的責任感者頗不乏人，可是心理上或許存着愛國之念，而事實上放棄責任，袖手旁觀者也大有人在。這是我居於日本人愛護中國的立塲，誠懇地直言指陳，希望這一般中國朋友澈底改變觀念，負起對國家的責任。負起復興中國的責任。</p>
<p>進一步說，當前是大東亞戰爭決勝的時代，日本和中國都是參戰的主要國家，對於爭取勝利，有共同的責任。在此危急存亡的生死關頭，絕不容許任何國民袖手旁觀而置身事外。我們在上海的人，尤須明瞭上海的地位，是戰爭後方的重要基地，上海人士的努力，對於大東亞戰爭勝利，具有很密切的關係。共次，縱不為大東亞勝利着想，僅就上海當地的幸福着想，則上海地方的一切責任，也應由居住上海的人們担當，也絕不容許任何上海人士袖手旁觀而置身事外，什麽是「明哲保身」，什麽是「潔身自好」，都是消極的逃避責任而已。</p>
<p>我謹以至誠吿訴我的中國好朋友，我們在上海居住的人，至少對於上海的一切應共同負起資任，過去，對於上海市政强化，上海市民福利，相信是居住上海的每一個市民所關心的。現在，上海市政當局已有決心强化市政，從最近的健全人事，取締賭博等揩施以觀，足以初步證明了。目前又成立市政路詢委員會，更是力爭上游的表示。我很希望我的中國朋友，尤其是有資望有器識得朋友，從消極觀念變成積極觀念，不存政治成見，不存黨派私見，以「我不入地獄誰人地獄」之精神，共同負起資任，為市民謀幸福。</p>
<p>天下興亡！匹夫有責！上海興亡！上海人有責！</p>
<h3 id="c2">日大本營昨宣布佔領要衝哥希馬　加拉頓區亦將展開殲滅戰 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大本營八日下午五時十分發表：　日新銳部隊與印國民軍，於六日晨佔領　姆法爾至達馬普爾公路要衝　希馬。術銳　對加薩一帶敵空軍挺身部隊之攻擊，正順利進展中。</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　緬印國境敵軍防衛印度之最大據點齊卡，　日軍猛攻已經潰減，日軍精銳各部隊於四日黎明由左方山腹湧至齊卡要塞，而將其完全佔領，刻繼續掃蕩殘敝，並自印度境內密林地帶進抵伊姆法爾平原。</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　日軍先鋒部隊與印度國民軍，同於八日拂曉機續猛攻敵各陳地，伊姆法爾之陷落，巳成時間問題·回顧日軍於三月八日在中部印緬邊境開始發動後，敵軍雖持以機機化部隊及空軍拚命反攻，而日軍仍能出奇以制勝，將伊姆法爾，烏克魯爾，達姆，　達密等地間之敵環狀道路遮斷，計時僅一月，即迫至伊姆法爾附近。又敵空革挺身隊，雖在北緬蠢動達兩月之久，企圖擾亂日後方陣地，但終陷於孤立而慘敗。</p>
<p>緬印加拉領前綫八日中央社電　被日軍包圍中之西非軍主力約四千之衆，圖茍喘其負隅抵抗工作，但目前又有一部印卡車向北遁走，殘餘之敵軍則已臨絕境，其崩潰當在旦夕。日軍於四日曾截擊於加買附近正行渡河之敵軍，獲得莫大戰果，現正續行掃蕩中，前日軍其他部隊則迂遇至北方，將敵軍很路切斷粉碎其職門力，故敵已完全被包圍，因此加拉頓谷地區將展開大殲滅戰。</p>
<h3 id="c3">印度洋風雲緊迫英艦隊實力薄弱　日軍事家表明四項見解 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日印軍之進攻印度作戰，進展極為順利，要衝伊姆法爾，已指日可下，刻正到處展開包圍戰，英印軍全被殲滅之危機，巳迫目前。然當此敵陸上作戰危險萬分之際，印度洋之英國艦隊，對此仍取漠視態度，甘願負「無聲艦隊」之醜名，此間軍事專家，頃曾就「印度洋反軸心艦隊何故緘守沉默」及「蠢動之期在何時」等二問題，發表見解如次：第一，迄現在止，印度投洋艦隊所以未曾活動者，乃因與日本艦隊決戰無勝利之自信故也。據去年末，德交易報之觀測，敵印度洋艦隊，僅擁有主力艦七至八艦，航空母艦五艘，重巡洋艦八艘，此外，則為少數驅逐艦，僅以此種程度之兵力，自無與强力之日本艦隊一決雌雄之勇氣，尤以英印度洋艦隊與於太平洋作戰之時海軍逈異，印度洋距英本國　當遙遠，其艦隊一旦遭受痛擊後，其補給與增援所需時日過長，一時絕難恢復，此或亦即為英國不敢作孤注一擲之印度洋海戰之最大原因。第二，為運轍船舶之不足，英國所保有之船舶，除本國所必需者外，所餘實屬無幾，美國縱有多少船舶供其使用，但因用於義大利作戰中，補給工作上，且當此豪語即將結成歐洲第二戰綫之際，亦必須於本國集結大量船舶，故絕難餘有大船舶羣航赴印度洋。第三，為於印度洋上作職航空兵力之不足，英國空軍最大任務，在於防衛木地，故長距離轟炸　之製造工業發達較遲，於近代海戰除需艦隊航空兵力外，且須有基地，航空隊之掩護，此對戰局之影響亦頗鉅，自不待言，然英長距離轟炸機之性能，於此種作戰時間為不利，勢必須受美國空軍之援助，但美空軍於目前欲集結有力之基地航空部隊，亦絕非輕而易舉之事。第四，為印度洋艦隊根據地尙未達成以遂行大規模作戰之地步，緣英國於該方面之軍港，除孟買外，自新加坡陷落後，即積極努力，使錫蘭島基地化，以為防衛印度之前進海上據點，故前此　積極整備該島之可倫坡及亨可馬　兩港，此巳為週知之事實，但若以此為印度洋艦隊根據地及展開大規模作戰之據點，仍極感困難。蓋若展開印度洋作戰時，受創之艦艇必須航往南非之德班或澳洲始能修理故也。然印度洋反軸心艦隊今後絕不能永遠保持其沉默狀態，緣此以英國海軍為主力之印度洋艦歐，除具作戰之目的外，尚負有抑壓印度國民反英運動，遂行政治目的之使命，想舉墨維爾所部之印度洋艦隊，為協力陸上作戰，博得對印度國民之威信，不久之將來，仍將冒一切惡劣條件，不顧任何犧牲，展開反攻，印度洋上之風雲，即行緊迫。</p>
<h3 id="c4">印東部存糧　運往西部 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>盤谷八日中央社電　確息稱：英當局深恐印度東部之喪失，巳開始將該方面所貯藏之糧食運往西部，東南亞反軸心司令部補給負資人歐慶萊，曾屢言反軸心軍將擊退日軍，然當前戰局之不利，實無掩飾，近乃下命將孟加拉及阿　密兩省所存之糧食運往西部之西北邊省，俾路支之達境地方，衆認此舉為英方實行焦土戰術之先鋒。</p>

<p>南京七日中央社電　滿洲國駐華呂大使，於七日下午三時，接見首都新聞記者團，聞述滿洲國之建設狀况，曁協力於大東亞戰爭之坩產槪况，至為詳盡。並答記者團問，歷時頗久。茲將呂大使談話，曁對記者團之答問錄後：本人於去歲返國，因離開祖國已久，對各種情况，均極關儀，故特赴各地參觀，目覩國內建設之進展，自為快慰。去年為滿洲國第二期建設之第二年，舉國朝野，均按照預定國策，為國家之發展前途努力。對礦產之開發，與工業之發展，農業之增產等等，均有卓越成效。尤其是農業盟收，高梁大豆及其他雜糧等，較前年增加生產甚多，因之國內經濟充裕，配給圓滑，人民生活安定，人人均發揮自己力量，以貢獻一切予國家。七年在友邦日本協助下，更將從事大規模的農業　產，勞働技術資源等各方而，日本均將予滿洲國以强力的協助。呂大使談畢，並繼績對記者團作如下之問答。</p>
<p>物資交流完成增產</p>
<p>（問）對於貴吾兩國物資之交流，並促成進步之圓滑，願聆大使高見。（答）關於兩國的物資父流，因華北接近滿洲國，故以該地為物資交流之樞紐。去年中國北方帶，因棉產量少，致運往滿洲國很少，滿洲國為增產關係，頗期中國北方的之增產工作。（問）貴國建國以來，禁絕雅片一端最著成效。請將禁烟辦法重點，及實施經過，略述大槪。（答）滿洲國之禁烟辦法，開始是施用十年計劃，乃首光嚴厲調查吸烟人數，然后發　售　，逐期減少烟量。同時設立醫院，强迫限期戒絕，並嚴禁無照私吸。同時禁止私遝私販，禁止新吸，因之十年后，乃能收到肅淸烟毒之圓滿成效。</p>
<p>靑年訓練成效顯著</p>
<p>（問）日　漁　條約簽訂後，對貴國影　　何？（答）日蘇漁　條約簽訂者，對於滿洲　無直接影響。不過日蘇外交如此圓滿，滿蘇未來的外交，也可以有圓滿之收穫，吾人非常贊同此和協定。（問）滿洲國的靑少年訓練槪况如何？（答）滿洲國之靑少年訓練，是實訓練於實施工作，其訓練即於實施工作中訓練之。訓練範圍非常普及，尤着重於鄕村的靑少年訓練，於國家的貢獻，也非常重大。例如新京與哈爾濱間之鐵道工程　　定於三個月期中完成，旋經縝密之硏討，乃決定利用靑少年負責斯項工程，即召集該地區之靑少年，積極開工，僅十九天全部工程竟吿完成。他如此類而得力於靑少年之協助者，實甚繁多。因滿洲國之靑少年訓練有實際工作，極易引起靑少年之興趣，因此乃有顯著成效。</p>
<p>東京七日中央社電　今年為大東亞戰爭決勝年，凡我東亞十億民族，無不買獻一切，以爭取大東亞戰爭之最後建設，友邦滿洲國尤傾舉總力，協力完遂戰爭。際此決戰之年，其今後施政重點，與如何協力大東亞戰爭，尤為我人所重視。記者於滿大使接見記者發表談話後，復趨訪我駐滿大使陳濟成氏。提出問題數點，當承陳大使一一詳答，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>施政重點增强戰力</p>
<p>（問）滿洲國目前政治之推進，其重點為何？（答）滿洲國目前全國上下，集中於增强戰力一點，而於增强戰力，尤於增產方面，最為主要。不但鑛工業有大量生產，而於農物亦年有增加。（問）滿洲國出版事業之狀况，請略述一二。（答）滿洲政府於國務院之下，設一弘報處，各都市分設弘報股，負指導監督，及推行全國各省市宣傳報道事宜。至於新聞事業，為全國一元化，設康德新聞社於新京，各省市均設有支社。出版物雖不多，而對文藝方面，有麒麟說文誌·興亞·新滿洲·等許多刋物發行，銷路亦廣。其他關於社會靑年方面者，有民生及靑年文化等各刋物。（問）滿洲國之配給制度，頗為完善，請略予介紹。（答）配給制度，確為現時代之重耍產物，惟欲辦理完善，却屬不易。滿洲國配給制度，巳行之有年，逐漸改進，人民生活因之得以安定。</p>
<p>兩國當局尙　努力</p>
<p>（問）對於中滿兩國物資交流問題，請率省發表高見。（答）中滿物資交流，為戰時體制下重大之問題。近年滿洲有食糧木材等運來，而我方亦之努力，以完成戰時重要之工作也。（問）滿洲國農產最豐，其推行方法之重點如何？（答）滿洲農業增產確有顯著之成續，其所以致此之道，由於農種之改良，與農地之擴充，而治安之確立，尤為重耍原因。其他人事方面有農村之建設，與農合作社之組織歷年培養之農業人材，不但有熟繚之技術，又有建國精神之訓練。而新設之興農金庫，使農業金融更趨於圓滑也。</p>

<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　德軍於喀爾巴仟山系至普魯特河流域全錢所進行之猛攻　趨激烈，蘇軍之進攻已全被遏阻。據前綫消息，蘇軍雖曾進至基希納夫北三十里十公里之奧爾蓋夫（Orgeiev）但因遭受德軍反擊，復陷入苦戰狀態。據莫斯科之情報，謂蘇軍日前曾包國泰諾波爾·波羅斯科洛夫中間斯卡拉特（Skalat）之德軍，然在實際上其包圍圈並未完成，且因德軍部隊自　諾波爾西南來攻，刻蘇軍正注力於防禦戰。奧迪薩之攻防戰，頗呈漸次激烈之兆，蘇軍欲將該港收入其包圍中，自諾伐奧迪薩西南卅公里之貝萊索夫加開向黑海沿岸，然其先鋒似被德軍擊潰。路透社莫斯科特派員會報稱，奧迪薩之攻防戰，或將化為長期之因難戰。</p>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明决與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完逐，乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘　東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦日喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且　視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，目嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方為根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘書平民。在渝方分子，甘受英美驅使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於柬亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府為此宣吿，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀熊，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敎及好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携。以期共同建設以道養為某礎之東亞新秩序，德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋。迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貫獸，凡我國民，常知此為會現　國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之護得，胥繫於此。其一德一心，戳力始終，以實徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3 id="c23">ABCD海岸綫　歐洲登陸戰的焦點 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>這幾天來，東錢南部地區，北起舊波蘭的古維埃爾，南迄布格河下游的尼古萊夫，德蘇兩軍展開大規模的攻防戰。柯奈夫所部蘇軍前哨部隊，聲勢尚未稍殺，於十八日鼓其餘勇，渡過聶斯特河，侵入羅馬尼亞的貝薩拉比亞省</p>
<p>加强白晝空襲</p>
<p>與蘇軍東部戰綫猛攻相呼應的，英美在西歐開闢第二戰錢的問題，又令人側目了。原來前次德黑蘭會議時，英美曾向蘇聯保證，在東錢戰局推移至最適當時機，即在西歐發動戰爭。最近英美企圖炸毀德國占領地及德國所屬工業地帶，及削減德國戰鬥機隊實力，而加强自晝空襲，實為登陸作戰的先聲。加之，南部義大利卡西諾戰綫的再度活躍，那波里港集中大軍，使德兵力向南部進行牽制作戰，頗堪注目。因此第二戰綫的開關，似有亟亟不可終日之勢。</p>
<p>英美若果在西歐進行登陸戰，將選擇何處地點，觀測不一。為掩護圭力戰或分散德國兵力起見，或將在義大利，巴爾幹，法國南部及北歐各地，展開新作戰，以便主力登陸。西歐的登陸地點，依然以法國北部海岸，傳說最盛。以此為登陸作戰基地，距英國本土最近，在船腹的利用上，以及空軍的援護上，最為有利。英軍方面，且含有對一九四〇年鄧寇克戰敗之役，實施報復之意。</p>
<p>假定英國選定該一地點，英美對此誇稱英國本土南部已集合飛機一萬聲，待機而動，約有七十個師團的英美聯軍，將跨越一衣帶水的杜佛海峽而至法國北部，決意進行大冒險作戰。</p>
<p>法國北部地勢</p>
<p>英美登陸想像地點的北法海岸地帶的地勢，是以加萊省的突出處格里奈角為頂點大體開放成直角，而構成的海岸錢。以格里奈角為中心，北起加萊港，南迄波洛臬，長約五十公里的海岸綫，經過有名的杜佛海峽洪濤幾萬年來的浸蝕，平均闊約二百　的斷崖地層。不過該方面的德國防禦陣地，異常堅固，加以地形有利，不帝銅牆鐵壁，英美上陸舟艇絕難接近。敵方如　免選擇格里奈角附近地點，而改趨其南波洛臬起，亞勃維爾白砂靑松接通的平坦海岸紅，或其北加萊港起，前年英軍自歐洲敗退的鄧寇克港所在的附近海岸錢。該地區，鐵路水運，有四通八達之使，為自古以來的戰塲。</p>
<p>亞勃雜爾的縮寫是A，波洛臬的縮寫是B，卡萊的縮寫是C，鄧寇克的縮寫是D，此一連結地點，謂之北法的ABCD海岸錢，最為英美所覬覦。目下陽春來臨，氣暖轉變、白日增長，對於登陸戰逐漸有利。敝力或將乘此天時地利之便，向北法海岸反攻，企圖開關第二戰綫。但天時與地利與其說在英美，毋寗說是在德國方面。</p>
<p>本年二月中旬，德軍對倫敦空　，獲有成果，過去一年間，德軍忍心捨棄東綫，蓄積兵力，並有重建空軍的雄圖，再加以新式的　彈砲出世，射擊飛機，準確無比；第二第三補充要塞錢的構築，西歐海岸，尤其是法國北部海岸一帶的要塞綫，已成鐵　之固。守護該要塞的德軍，正期待敵方由海上來襲，予以迎頭痛擊。行見杜佛海峽，將展開有史以來的大殲減戰，海峽的怒潮將被鮮血染成通紅。（譯自三月廿二日朝日新聞）</p>

<p>— 陳天卓</p>
<p>政府當局為求抑平物價創設物資調査會，成立迄今已兩年餘了，可是物似仍高漲不已。大家都以為物似高漲是由於通貨膨脹和戰時供不應求的原故。這固然是一部分理由，但是主要原因仍是靠當局的管理得法與否，印在日本就是一個很好的例子。自開戰以後物價平均不過漲兩倍左右而已，由此證明雖在通貨膨脹期內，抑平物價，並非根本沒有辦法，茲就管見所及錄下：</p>
<p>調查之不得法　每見調查員調查商店的貨價總是以其上月的發票為根據，拿着舊發票查對貨物的價格嗎，這是很不可靠的，我們要知道貨名，調查員　無從着手了。不但貨名可以改，甚至通廠家，批發號的名字商標隨時都可以變遷，今天興記，明天發記，今天馬牌，明天就可以變　牌了，這樣一來，就無從查起了。</p>
<p>配給品加價的影響　不喻戶口米，麵粉，糖油香烟陣　等，甚至公共事　的加價亦足影響其他貨品的　風，譬如戶口米的加價，但黑市的米價也跟着上漲了。（這是一向的事員），最近的啤酒加一價一倍，黑巿也漲一倍、這樣也就足以影響他物的漲價，譬如甲物和乙物是一與十之比，現在甲物漲了一倍，便二與十之比，乙物當然仍要保持十與一之比，也上漲了。甲影響乙，乙影響丙，丙再影響丁，一直影響下去，於是漲風羣起了。所以說很小的地方，往往影響是很大的，所以可能範圍，公共物品切切不能提高價格。</p>
<p>限價的提高　常常有很多物品的限價提高，這也足以影響他物的漲價，現在的黑巿價每每超過後，反使做黑市價的口實「限價巳到多少了」，黑市當然不約而同的也提高至相稱的水準，所以說據高限價，也就是提高黑巿價也同時違犯了第二條的弊病。</p>
<p>以上所說的希望當局加以改革，同時對於非法的囤積及黑市拾價的防止辦法，建議於下：</p>
<p>因為廠商批發號加價，零售店因為要營業（不見得關門停業）就不得不高價買進，也就不得不漲價出售，這樣的歸根結底的統制物價就非從廠商批發所，實施不可了。</p>
<p>工廠的出品，以其質為準，分甲乙丙丁等級，規定公平價格，不許製造五花八門的物品，使執行戰時生產劃一，同時到於調查也較便利。</p>
<p>除了生產劃一外，還要將其製造品的名稱，號碼訂價及樣品，交呈當局存記該準，方可發售。</p>
<p>凡工廠之出產品，必須製明出產日期，凡是這時期之出品一槪不許加價。</p>
<p>凡是零售店出售貨物，發票上一定要註明貨名廠號，貨號，價格字樣，少一不行，否則以黑巿買賣論。</p>
<p>配給品必須每日派員監督査察，是否有出售或減秤給少或黑巿出售等情。</p>
<p>一切存貨不論商店私人工廠等來一個總登記，由當局給一張登記證，書明貨名，貨主，數量，地點，將來出售亦須向常局登記過戶並書明價格，以防黑巿。</p>
<p>調査各倉棧商店及住宅之非法國積，加以管理，照限價出售。</p>
<p>派員調査一切專門投機買賣黑巿的字號，商行公司，以鐵面無私，逼令其停閉。以減少投機，黑巿操縱的淵藪。</p>
<p>對於娛樂塲所如：無廳、戲院，咖啡館，餐室，茶室或公園的門票等，一律以限制，不能自漲。雖我無關大局，但也能引起生活費指數的增高也就是影響他物的高漲</p>
<p>獎勵人民吿發非法之投機囤積，如係屬實則加以相當獎勵。</p>
<p>最後當局還須絕對注意調査員的行為特別派員監督　以防受賄作弊　至於調査員還需時時調換，各地移動，以減少情面，勢力，受賄等等許多弊漏。同時奸商們亦不勝應付這樣次次不同的來者了。</p>

<h3 id="c46">上海懷幼院一瞥 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>上海懷幼院本是個宗敎團體主辦的敎養機關，創立到現在巳經四年了，在這四年中間，他們曾更動了好些地方，由愚園路遷到淸心女中，又由女中遷到現在的——大佛廠淸心堂。</p>
<p>在四年中雖然居處不安，敎養的工作並不因此而停頓，目前所收養的兒童是二十人左右，因為地方狹窄，又是臨時性的，所以不預備擴充收養，兒童的年齡從六歲起到十六歲，男女兼收，這些兒童從家庭裏逃出來的佔多數，一部份是兒童保障科保送的。</p>
<p>據姆姆說：進院來的兒童，多數是有問題的孩子，因為家庭環境的不良，影響到他們的品格，着手的方法，仍以家庭的方式去改造他們。</p>
<p>他們的生活比較簡單，上干上課，分高級低級兩班，下午一時以後做手工，于工袛有縫級一種，縫的衣服是自己穿用的，對外並不承做，晚上八時有一個家庭集會，檢討他們的生活。</p>
<p>被感化的孩子</p>
<p>在這裏有一個時間住的最久的女孩子，到現在巳有三年了，在最初她因為受不住後母的虐待，憤而出走，到了院裏，過了些時，常和別的孩子吵鬧，又逃跑了，後來被兒童保障科收了去，姆姆去看她，她哭了，她懺悔當初的逃跑是不對的，她願意再回到院裏來，但院裏的規則凡是逃走的孩子，是不許再回去的，終於因為她的懇求，給了她回來的機會，以後她纔覺悟到逃走不是好的事情，行為也漸漸改好了，院方送她到工部局子弟學校讀書，二年中她都考得第一名，她現在所希望着得是在院裏學到一點本領，將來也　社會服務。</p>
<p>他們的房屋現在是向淸心堂借用的，地方旣狹窄，而且又不能長住以目前最感到迫切的便是屋的問題，姆姆對我說：，如果房屋能够大一點的話，他們還可以增加一點收養的人數，但目前的房屋又都要顧大德頂費，這是他們當然是辦不到的，他們希望社會上得熱心的個人或社團，能給他們解決一個屋得問題，那是他們所最祈求着的。</p>

<p>「一定會痛快淋漓地轟炸倫敦和巴黎的吧！」</p>

<p>他們的興味中心，除可以說吸引他們熱烈感情的，是英國海軍。</p>
<p>「然而，美國會起而參戰麽？」</p>
<p>「或許馬上參戰的。」</p>
<p>大家一致都認為這樣，於是就沉默了片刻，遵時中野小聲說：「我們不快一點參戰麽？」</p>
<p>這一句話正好像茶種東西觸動了大家的感情，而不期然而然地哄堂大笑。然而道個笑聲，立刻就消逝於無形。</p>
<p>「我們帝國究竟怎樣辦？」</p>
<p>岡山這樣說完，而引起大家的思索。現在他們業巳不是兵學校的學生時代了，而有資格談這類問題了。</p>
<p>「現在並不是談光怪陸離的時代了！」</p>
<p>「對於太平洋，一定會波及到的。」</p>
<p>「這就要準備的……」</p>
<p>「哼，準備早巳完成了。現在只是怎樣決定的問題。老谷，你說是不？」</p>
<p>中野這樣問了一句，眞人方開口。</p>

<p>所有候補生的心，都傾向於遠洋航海，然而對於佐世保軍港，也決不能說輕鬆地忽略過去。因為在他們的心中，有幾分之一的觀念，想在將來，以這個軍港為毋港。而且因為在他們的心板上，曾記憶着甲午中日戰役與日俄戰役時，這個軍港曾發揮過很大的作用。無論是辦天島的島影也好，榮町的繁華也好，全都深刻地映入他們的眼簾，以致永生不能忘記。</p>

<h3 id="e1">National Survival is Everyone's Responsibility — A Sincere Message to My Good Chinese Friends — <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>— Tatsujiro Funatsu</p>
<p>Yesterday, the *Shen Bao*'s editorial discussed "Do Not Be Lazy," expecting the government to do more for the country and seek more benefits for the people. It encouraged the people to contribute all their strength and do more for the country and society. Indeed, the nation is a whole group, and the people are the constituent elements of that whole group. To demand that the whole group exert its strength, it is of course based on the individual efforts of each constituent element. Therefore, a national of a country who hopes that the country is strong and that the country is restored to prosperity must first clearly recognize that it is the duty of each and every citizen, and that no one can abandon this responsibility. If the people abandon their responsibility to the country, then the entire strength of the country will tend to be weak and gradually decline. At this time, the fate of the people will naturally fall into a tragic situation. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, where will the hair attach itself?" I think truly patriotic citizens will certainly clearly understand the crux of this matter. In other words, if a citizen cannot contribute all his strength in a down-to-earth manner, fulfill his duty to the country, and shoulder his responsibility to the country, and yet boasts of being patriotic and hopes for the country's restoration and prosperity, then, I ask, who will bear the fruit? This is not only not patriotic, but simply enough to mislead the country. "The rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual." These two sentences concretely illustrate that every citizen has a responsibility to the country. Mr. Gu Yanwu is admired by the Chinese people, especially those in the knowledge class who boast of being patriots. They all know the spirit of these two sentences, so they should absolutely abide by this instruction.</p>
<p>I have been in China for fifty-six years, and China is like my second hometown. I love China the most. Therefore, I am not promoting Japan, but rather comparing the Japanese people and the Chinese people. To be honest, the Japanese people's sense of responsibility to the country is more universal and enthusiastic than that of the Chinese people. Of course, there are quite a few Chinese citizens who have a high sense of responsibility to the country, but perhaps in their minds they have the idea of patriotism, but in fact they abandon their responsibility and stand by with their hands in their sleeves. This is my sincere and frank statement from the standpoint of a Japanese person who loves China. I hope that these Chinese friends will thoroughly change their views and take on the responsibility to the country. Take on the responsibility of revitalizing China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the present is the decisive era of the Greater East Asia War. Japan and China are both major participating countries and have a common responsibility for striving for victory. At this critical juncture of survival, no citizen should be allowed to stand by with his hands in his sleeves and stay out of the matter. We people in Shanghai must especially understand Shanghai's position as an important base in the rear of the war. The efforts of the people of Shanghai are closely related to the victory of the Greater East Asia War. Second, even if we are not thinking about the victory of Greater East Asia, but only about the happiness of Shanghai, then all the responsibilities of Shanghai should also be borne by the people living in Shanghai, and no Shanghai resident should be allowed to stand by and stay out of the matter. What is "protecting oneself wisely"? What is "keeping oneself clean"? They are all passively evading responsibility.</p>
<p>I would like to sincerely tell my good Chinese friends that we people living in Shanghai should at least jointly bear the responsibility for everything in Shanghai. In the past, strengthening Shanghai's municipal administration and the welfare of Shanghai citizens were believed to be the concerns of every citizen living in Shanghai. Now, the Shanghai municipal authorities are determined to strengthen the municipal administration. Judging from the recent measures to improve personnel and eliminate gambling, this is sufficient to prove this initially. The establishment of the Municipal Administration Advisory Committee is an expression of striving for improvement. I very much hope that my Chinese friends, especially those with qualifications and knowledge, will change from a passive concept to an active concept, without political prejudices and without partisan prejudices, and with the spirit of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" jointly shoulder the responsibility and seek happiness for the citizens.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of the world! Every individual is responsible! The rise and fall of Shanghai! The people of Shanghai are responsible!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Imperial General Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Occupation of the Strategic Point of Kohima, and a Decisive Battle Will Also Be Launched in the Kaladan Area <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:10 PM on the 8th: Japanese elite troops and the Indian National Army occupied Kohima, a strategic point on the Imphal-Dimapur road, on the morning of the 6th. The attack by our troops on the enemy's airborne troops in the Gasa area is progressing smoothly.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – The largest stronghold of the enemy army on the Burma-India border defending India, Chika, has been severely weakened by the fierce attack of the Japanese army. On the dawn of the 4th, elite Japanese troops surged from the mountains on the left side to the Chika fortress and completely occupied it. The mopping up of the remnants continues, and they have advanced from the dense forest area within India to the Imphal Plain.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese vanguard and the Indian National Army continued to fiercely attack the enemy's positions at dawn on the 8th. The fall of Imphal is only a matter of time. Looking back, since the Japanese army launched an offensive on the central India-Burma border on March 8th, although the enemy army desperately counterattacked with mechanized units and air force, the Japanese army was still able to defeat them by surprise and cut off the enemy's ring road between Imphal, Ukhrul, Tamu, and Tiddim, in just one month, forcing them to approach Imphal. In addition, the enemy's airborne commando unit, although it was active in northern Burma for two months, attempting to disrupt the Japanese rear positions, eventually fell into isolation and was completely defeated.</p>
<p>Kaladan Valley Front Line, Burma-India, 8th (Central News Agency) – The main force of the West African army, about 4,000 strong, surrounded by the Japanese army, is trying to resist stubbornly. However, now a unit of Indian trucks is fleeing north, and the remaining enemy troops are facing a desperate situation, and their collapse is imminent. On the 4th, the Japanese army intercepted enemy troops who were crossing the river near Kalemyo, achieving great results, and are continuing to mop up. The day before yesterday, other Japanese troops detoured to the north and cut off the enemy's retreat route, shattering their organizational strength, so the enemy has been completely surrounded. Therefore, a major annihilation battle will be launched in the Kaladan Valley area.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Situation in the Indian Ocean is Tense, the Strength of the British Fleet is Weak - Japanese Military Experts Express Four Views <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese-Indian army's offensive operation into India is progressing extremely smoothly. The strategic point of Imphal is expected to be captured soon, and encirclement battles are being launched everywhere. The crisis of the complete annihilation of the British-Indian army is imminent. However, while the enemy's ground operations are extremely dangerous, the British fleet in the Indian Ocean is still taking a indifferent attitude, willing to bear the ugly name of the "silent fleet." Military experts here recently expressed their views on two questions: "Why is the anti-Axis fleet in the Indian Ocean keeping silent?" and "When will it move?" as follows: First, the reason why the Indian Ocean fleet has not been active so far is because it lacks the confidence to win a decisive battle with the Japanese fleet. According to observations in *De Transvaler* at the end of last year, the enemy's Indian Ocean fleet has only seven to eight battleships, five aircraft carriers, and eight heavy cruisers. In addition, there are a small number of destroyers. With this level of strength, it naturally does not have the courage to fight against the powerful Japanese fleet. In particular, the British Indian Ocean fleet is very different from the navy when it was operating in the Pacific. The Indian Ocean is very far from the British mainland. Once its fleet suffers a heavy blow, the time required for its replenishment and reinforcement is too long, and it is absolutely difficult to recover in a short period of time. This may also be the biggest reason why Britain does not dare to gamble on a sea battle in the Indian Ocean. Second, there is a lack of transport ships. The ships retained by the United Kingdom are very few, except for those necessary for the country. Even if the United States has many ships for its use, they are being used in the Italian campaign, and the supply work, and since the grand plan to form a second European front is about to be completed, it is also necessary to gather a large number of ships in the country, so it is absolutely difficult to have a large number of ships sailing to the Indian Ocean. Third, there is insufficient air power for operations in the Indian Ocean. The British Air Force's biggest mission is to defend its homeland, so the manufacturing industry of long-range bombers developed relatively late. In modern naval warfare, in addition to fleet air power, it is also necessary to have a base and the protection of the air force. This has a great impact on the situation of the war, which goes without saying. However, the performance of British long-range bombers is unfavorable in this type of operation, and it is bound to receive assistance from the US Air Force. However, it is by no means easy for the US Air Force to assemble a powerful base air unit at present. Fourth, the bases of the Indian Ocean Fleet have not yet reached the point where they can carry out large-scale operations. Because Britain's naval ports in that area, in addition to Bombay, have been actively working to make Ceylon Island a base since the fall of Singapore, as an advanced maritime base for defending India. Therefore, it has been actively preparing the two ports of Colombo and Trincomalee on the island. This is already a well-known fact, but it is still extremely difficult to use this as the base of the Indian Ocean Fleet and the base for carrying out large-scale operations. Because when launching operations in the Indian Ocean, damaged ships must sail to Durban in South Africa or Australia to be repaired. However, the anti-Axis fleet in the Indian Ocean cannot remain silent forever. The Indian Ocean fleet, which is mainly composed of the British Navy, in addition to the purpose of combat, also has the mission of suppressing the anti-British movement of Indian citizens and carrying out political goals. It is thought that the Indian Ocean Fleet under the command of Somerville will cooperate with ground operations to gain prestige among Indian citizens. In the near future, it will still launch a counterattack regardless of all adverse conditions and sacrifices. The situation in the Indian Ocean is about to become tense.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 8th (Central News Agency) – Reliable sources say: The British authorities, fearing the loss of eastern India, have begun to transport the food supplies stored in that area to the west. O'Kinchley, the person in charge of supplies for the Southeast Asia anti-Axis Command, has repeatedly stated that the anti-Axis forces will repel the Japanese army, but the current unfavorable war situation cannot be concealed. Recently, he ordered that the food supplies stored in the two provinces of Bengal and Assam be transported to the northwestern frontier provinces of the west, and to the areas of Baluchistan. It is generally believed that this move is the vanguard of the British implementing a scorched earth tactic.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Manchuria Increases Production and Construction Nationwide, Determined to Cooperate in Completing the War - Ambassadors Lu and Chen Give Speeches in Nanjing <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Manchurian Ambassador to China, Lu, met with the capital's press corps at 3:00 PM on the 7th and gave a very detailed account of Manchuria's construction situation and the overall situation of production in cooperation with the Greater East Asia War. He also answered questions from the press corps, which lasted for quite a long time. The following is a record of Ambassador Lu's speech and answers to the press corps: I returned to my country last year. Because I had been away from my motherland for a long time, I was extremely concerned about various situations, so I made a special trip to visit various places. Seeing the progress of domestic construction, I was very gratified. Last year was the second year of Manchuria's second phase of construction. The whole country, from top to bottom, was working hard for the country's development prospects in accordance with the predetermined national policies. Remarkable results have been achieved in the development of minerals, the development of industry, and the increase in agricultural production. In particular, the agricultural harvest of sorghum, soybeans, and other miscellaneous grains increased significantly compared to the previous year, so the domestic economy is abundant, the distribution is smooth, and the people's lives are stable. Everyone is exerting their own strength to contribute everything to the country. This year, with the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan, we will engage in large-scale agricultural production. Japan will provide strong assistance to Manchuria in all aspects of labor, technology, and resources. After Ambassador Lu finished speaking, he continued to answer the press corps' questions as follows.</p>
<p>Material Exchange Completes Increased Production</p>
<p>(Q) Regarding the exchange of materials between our two countries and the promotion of smooth progress, I would like to hear your Excellency's high opinion. (A) Regarding the flow of materials between the two countries, because North China is close to Manchuria, that area is the hub for material exchange. Last year, the northern belt of China had a small cotton yield, so very little was transported to Manchuria. Manchuria, in order to increase production, greatly expects the increase in production work in northern China. (Q) Since your country was founded, the prohibition of opium has been the most effective. Please briefly describe the key points of the anti-smoking measures and the implementation process. (A) Manchuria's anti-smoking measures initially implemented a ten-year plan, which first strictly investigated the number of smokers, and then issued licenses for sale, gradually reducing the amount of smoke. At the same time, hospitals were established to forcibly quit smoking within a limited time, and unauthorized private smoking was strictly prohibited. At the same time, private smuggling and sales were prohibited, and new smoking was prohibited. Therefore, after ten years, the satisfactory effect of eliminating the scourge of smoking was achieved.</p>
<p>Youth Training is Remarkably Effective</p>
<p>(Q) What is the impact on your country after the signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty? (A) The signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing treaty has no direct impact on Manchuria. However, with such a satisfactory diplomatic relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union, the future diplomacy between Manchuria and the Soviet Union can also have a satisfactory harvest. We greatly approve of this concord agreement. (Q) What is the general situation of youth training in Manchuria? (A) The youth training in Manchuria is practical training in practical work, and the training is training in practical work. The scope of training is very widespread, and it especially emphasizes the youth training in the countryside. The contribution to the country is also very significant. For example, the railway project between Changchun and Harbin was originally scheduled to be completed in three months. After careful research, it was decided to use young people to be responsible for this project. Young people in the area were mobilized to actively start work, and the entire project was completed in only nineteen days. There are many other similar cases where we benefited from the assistance of young people. Because youth training in Manchuria has practical work, it is very easy to arouse the interest of young people, so there are remarkable results.</p>
<p>The Authorities of Both Countries are Still Working Hard</p>
<p>(Q) Regarding the issue of material exchange between China and Manchuria, please express your high opinion. (A) Material exchange between China and Manchuria is a major issue under the wartime system. In recent years, Manchuria has transported food, timber, etc., and we are also working hard to complete important work during wartime. (Q) Manchuria has the most abundant agricultural production. What are the key points of its promotion methods? (A) Manchuria's agricultural production increase has indeed achieved remarkable results. The reason for this is due to the improvement of agricultural seeds and the expansion of agricultural land, and the establishment of security is also an important reason. Others include the construction of rural areas in terms of personnel, and the organization of agricultural cooperative societies. The agricultural talents cultivated over the years not only have proficient technology, but also have the training of the spirit of national construction. The newly established Agricultural Development Bank makes agricultural finance more smooth.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – This year is the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. All one billion people in East Asia are donating everything to strive for the final construction of the Greater East Asia War. The friendly nation of Manchuria is also exerting all its strength to cooperate in completing the war. At this time of decisive battle, the key points of its future administration and how to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War are especially valued by us. After Ambassador Lu met with reporters and gave a speech, the reporter also visited our ambassador to Manchuria, Chen Jicheng. He raised several questions, and Ambassador Chen answered each one in detail. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Key Points of Administration to Enhance Combat Power</p>
<p>(Q) What is the focus of the current political advancement in Manchuria? (A) Currently, the entire country of Manchuria is focused on enhancing combat power, and among the enhancement of combat power, increasing production is the most important. Not only is there a large production in the mining industry, but there is also an annual increase in agricultural products. (Q) Please briefly describe the situation of the publishing industry in Manchuria. (A) The Manchurian government has established a Hongbao Office under the State Council, and Hongbao branches are set up in various cities to guide, supervise, and promote propaganda and reporting in various provinces and cities across the country. As for the news industry, in order to unify the whole country, Kangde News Agency was established in Changchun, and branches were established in various provinces and cities. Although there are not many publications, there are many publications issued in the field of literature and art, such as *Kirin Shuowen Zhi*, *Xingya*, and *New Manchuria*, which are widely circulated. Other publications concerning society and youth include *Minsheng* and *Youth Culture*, etc. (Q) The rationing system in Manchuria is quite perfect. Please briefly introduce it. (A) The rationing system is indeed an important product of the present era, but it is not easy to manage it perfectly. The rationing system in Manchuria has been in place for many years and has been gradually improved, so that people's lives can be stabilized.</p>
<p>The Authorities of Both Countries Are Still Working Hard</p>
<p>(Q) Regarding the issue of material exchange between China and Manchuria, please express your high opinion briefly. (A) Material exchange between China and Manchuria is a major issue under the wartime system. In recent years, Manchuria has transported food, timber, etc., and we are also working hard to complete important work during wartime. (Q) Manchuria's agricultural production is the most abundant. What are the key points of its promotion methods? (A) Manchuria's agricultural production increase has indeed achieved remarkable results.

<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - The German army's fierce offensive across the front line from the Carpathian Mountains to the Prut River basin is intensifying, and the Soviet offensive has been completely contained. According to front-line news, although the Soviet army had advanced to Orgeiev, 30 kilometers north of Chisinau, it suffered a German counterattack and was again engaged in fierce fighting. According to information from Moscow, the Soviet army had previously encircled the German forces in Skalat, between Tarnopol and Proskurov, but in reality, the encirclement was not complete, and because German troops attacked from the southwest of Tarnopol, the Soviet army is now focusing on defensive battles. The battle for Odessa is showing signs of gradually intensifying. The Soviet army wants to incorporate the port into its encirclement, opening up from Berezovka, 30 kilometers southwest of Novaya Odessa, towards the Black Sea coast, but its vanguard seems to have been defeated by the German army. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow reports that the battle for Odessa may turn into a long and difficult war.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, British newspapers jokingly reported that U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius arrived in London yesterday, accompanied by Matthews, Assistant Secretary for European Affairs, Murray, Director of the Near East and Africa Division, and Dr. Bowman, President of Johns Hopkins University, a renowned geographer. When reporters asked Stettinius about the purpose of his trip, he declined to answer, saying only that he would stay in London for two weeks and meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden and other cabinet members. It is said that the issues he will discuss include Poland, the Atlantic Charter, Anglo-American recognition of the Badoglio government, and the status of the Greek and Southern European governments in exile. The participation of Dr. Bowman is considered to be of great significance, as it is believed that he and others will at least study post-war border issues. Bowman served as an advisor to President Wilson at the Versailles Conference and has since been a member of numerous international organizations.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, the London correspondent of the Swedish Dagens Nyheter reported that political circles in London consider U.S. Under Secretary of State Stettinius's trip to London to be the most important of the anti-Axis negotiations, but that the discussions will be only preparatory in nature. The decisions to be made are: 1. The policy to be adopted towards Portugal. 2. The gasoline issue. 3. Economic issues, including the tonnage of U.S. merchant ships and the cancellation of Lend-Lease aid. 4. The use of post-war Pacific and Axis bases. 5. The settlement of European Soviet land issues. It is likely that Soviet Ambassador Gusev will participate in these discussions. Regarding Pacific bases, it is likely that all anti-Axis countries will be allowed to use them, and the Australian and Dutch authorities share this view.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Declaration of War by the National Government <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor Japan. Since then, it has embarked on the New National Movement, committed to ensuring public security, improving the people's livelihood, and increasing national strength to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the United Kingdom and the United States continue to pursue their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and have intensified their efforts by enticing elements from Chongqing to join the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been successively defeated by the armed forces of our ally Japan, and their bases of aggression in East Asia are being lost day by day, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, disregarding the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, they have instigated elements from Chongqing to continuously harass us, hindering the progress of various constructions, and directly using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb our Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, massacring civilians. The elements in Chongqing, willingly driven by the United Kingdom and the United States, shamefully act as rebels of East Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States, harboring deep-seated intentions towards East Asia, exhaust their ability to sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate ambition of annexation, which is something that all East Asian nations should unite against. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States, and will devote all its strength to cooperate with its ally Japan, to sweep away the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The two countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same heart for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, we should further promote cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality and virtue. Our allied countries of Germany and Italy have been engaged in a struggle with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for several years, achieving glorious victories. Our country now joins the Greater East Asia War, and we should echo each other, in order to ensure the implementation of a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should always know that this is the only opportunity to realize the grand Pan-Asianism of the Founding Father of the Republic, the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the protection of the faith, justice and peace of the entire world. Let us be of one mind and one heart, and work hard from beginning to end, in order to thoroughly fulfill the great mission of this great era!</p>

<h3 id="e23">ABCD Coastline - The Focus of the European Landing Campaign <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, in the southern region of the Eastern Front, from Kuiavia in former Poland in the north to Nikolaev at the lower reaches of the Bug River in the south, the German and Soviet armies have launched large-scale offensive and defensive battles. The vanguard of Konev's Soviet forces, their momentum undiminished, crossed the Dniester River on the 18th, mustering their remaining courage, and invaded Bessarabia province of Romania.</p>
<p>Strengthening Daylight Air Raids</p>
<p>Echoing the fierce offensives of the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, the issue of the Anglo-American opening of a second front in Western Europe has once again attracted attention. Originally, at the Tehran Conference, the United Kingdom and the United States had assured the Soviet Union that they would launch a war in Western Europe when the situation on the Eastern Front reached its most opportune moment. Recently, the Anglo-American attempt to destroy German-occupied territories and German industrial areas, and to reduce the strength of the German fighter fleet, and strengthen daylight air raids, is actually the prelude to a landing operation. In addition, the re-activation of the Cassino front in southern Italy and the concentration of large forces in the port of Naples, to distract German forces and conduct a diversionary operation in the south, is noteworthy. Therefore, the opening of a second front seems to be an increasingly urgent matter.</p>
<p>If the United Kingdom and the United States were to conduct a landing operation in Western Europe, where would they choose the location? There are varying opinions. In order to cover up the main attack or to disperse German forces, new operations may be launched in Italy, the Balkans, southern France, and Northern Europe, in order to prepare for the main landing. The northern coast of France remains the most talked-about landing site in Western Europe. Using this as a base for landing operations, it is closest to the British mainland, and the use of ships and the support of the air force are most advantageous. On the British side, there is also the intention to retaliate for the defeat at Dunkirk in 1940.</p>
<p>Assuming that the United Kingdom chooses this location, the United Kingdom and the United States boast that 10,000 aircraft have been assembled in southern England, waiting for the opportunity to move. About seventy divisions of Anglo-American Allied forces will cross the English Channel and arrive in northern France, determined to carry out a major adventure.</p>
<p>Topography of Northern France</p>
<p>The topography of the northern French coastal area, the imagined landing site of the Anglo-Americans, is a coastline generally open at a right angle with Cape Gris-Nez in the Pas-de-Calais department as its vertex. Centered on Cape Gris-Nez, the coastline extends approximately 50 kilometers from the port of Calais in the north to Boulogne-sur-Mer in the south. The famous white cliffs of Dover have been eroded by the waves for thousands of years, forming an average width of about 200 meters of cliff formations. However, the German defensive positions in this area are extremely solid, and the terrain is favorable, forming an impregnable wall. It would be extremely difficult for Anglo-American landing craft to approach. The enemy may avoid choosing a location near Cape Gris-Nez, and instead turn to the flat coastline of white sand and green pines extending south from Boulogne-sur-Mer to Abbeville, or the coastline north from the port of Calais to the area near Dunkirk, where the British army retreated from Europe in the past. The railways and waterways in this area are well-developed in all directions, making it a battlefield since ancient times.</p>
<p>Abbeville is abbreviated as A, Boulogne-sur-Mer as B, Calais as C, and Dunkirk as D. This connected area is called the ABCD coastline of northern France, which is most coveted by the Anglo-Americans. At present, the warm spring has arrived, the weather is turning warmer, and the days are getting longer, which is gradually favorable for landing operations. The Allies may take advantage of this opportune time and favorable location to launch a counter-offensive on the northern French coast in an attempt to open a second front. But it is more appropriate to say that the opportune time and favorable location are on the German side, rather than on the Anglo-American side.</p>
<p>In mid-February of this year, the German army achieved results in the air raid on London. Over the past year, the German army has patiently abandoned the Eastern Front, accumulating forces, and has the ambition to rebuild the air force. In addition, the new type of bomb cannon has been developed, shooting down aircraft with unparalleled accuracy. The construction of the second and third supplementary fortress lines has made the fortress line on the Western European coast, especially the northern French coast, as solid as iron. The German troops guarding this fortress are waiting for the enemy to attack from the sea and give them a head-on blow. It is expected that the English Channel will witness the largest annihilation battle in history, and the raging tide of the Channel will be dyed red with blood.

<h3 id="e24">Today is the Fourth Air Defense Day - Rescue Training to be Held - Thousands of Members of the City's Defense Corps Mobilized <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Today (9th) is the fourth Air Defense Day. In order to strengthen the city's air defense, thousands of members of the city's defense corps will be mobilized to devote their full efforts to rescue training. The City Air Defense Headquarters will dispatch a large number of instructors to various locations to provide guidance. What the relevant authorities are most concerned about is the comprehensive training of Chinese and foreign citizens to be carried out in front of the Telegraph Bureau within the jurisdiction of the Hongkou Branch, or on Minhang Road, from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM this afternoon. In addition, China Film Company has specially dispatched photographers to various locations to capture materials suitable for the air defense headquarters' current plan to produce air defense films.</p>
<p>Air Defense Headquarters Distributed Air Defense First Aid Kits to Various Schools Yesterday</p>
<p>The City Air Defense Headquarters held a ceremony at 10:30 AM yesterday (8th) to donate air defense first aid kits to various schools. 430 air defense first aid kits were donated to 38 schools that participated in the air defense badge charity sale movement on the first Air Defense Day, January 9th of this year. At a time when various materials are scarce and it is difficult to purchase materials needed for first aid, fortunately, the citizens sympathize with and understand the schools' air defense, so the plan to prepare and distribute air defense first aid kits to various schools can be fulfilled as desired, making the fourth Air Defense Day even more meaningful, which is truly gratifying. The Air Defense authorities are now working hard to strengthen the air defense facilities of various schools and plan to hold another charity sale movement. We sincerely hope that citizens from all walks of life will cooperate. During the donation ceremony, the Air Defense Headquarters also awarded bonuses to the schools with the best results in the previous charity sale movement, such as Feihong Model Primary School, Chengyi Middle School, Zhabei Primary School, and Municipal Model Middle School, each receiving a bonus. Director Sun of the General Affairs Department spoke on behalf of Director Chen, saying: "I am Sun, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the City Air Defense Headquarters. I am honored to be able to take this opportunity to speak to you on behalf of Director Chen. January 9th of this year is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. In order to reveal the true meaning of participating in the war, and to devise countermeasures to cope with extraordinary times, the City Air Defense Headquarters designated this day as the first Air Defense Day, in order to awaken citizens' attention to air defense. At the same time, an air defense badge charity sale movement was held, inviting various schools in the city to participate to provide assistance. The total amount of money raised from the charity sale has been published in the newspapers on March 9th. Shanghai is not only the center of China, but also a major center of East Asia today. It is difficult to predict when the enemy planes will bomb us, but the Headquarters' responsibility lies in making efforts to properly prepare measures to ensure safety, which requires the spiritual and material preparations of the general public. Air defense in schools is also necessary. Today, first aid kits are distributed to various schools. In terms of both quality and quantity, these first aid kits are not perfect, but the intention of the Headquarters is to use this opportunity to enable each school to expand the expansion of first aid equipment within its possible range, and it is also necessary to expand fire prevention and evacuation facilities, so that air defense in schools can be further strengthened, so that Shanghai's air defense affairs can be perfected."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry instructed various economic bureaus: It is hereby noted that the first motion proposed at the provisional meeting of the Local Economic Policy Liaison Conference convened by this Ministry, proposed by the Shanghai Special Municipality Economic Bureau, stated that all industrial and commercial guilds should be unified under the management of the local economic bureau, to centralize authority. The resolution, except for the grain and banking guilds, was that all other industrial and commercial guilds should be unified under the management of the local economic bureau. The record of this matter has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and approved under Directive Zheng Zi No. 2647, stating: "Submitted for your information: The division of management authority over industrial and commercial guilds shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Amended Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Guilds. You must comply with this order." In addition to issuing separate orders, the relevant bureau is hereby ordered to comply with this order.</p>
<p>Stock Exchange: Transactions Exist Without a Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock exchange handled pre-Qingming Festival deliveries and closed the market. Brokers outside the exchange also did not open for business. Despite the upward trend in the past ten days, most of the four popular stocks lacked a market, even though bids were called. Only Mei Ya Silk Fabric at 167 yuan, Wing On Company at 182-183 yuan, China Film at 51 yuan and 51.5 yuan were bid. Wing On Cotton Mill traded at 174 yuan, and then had no buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Offering Some Opinions on Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianzhuo</p>
<p>The government authorities established the Materials Investigation Committee to suppress and stabilize prices. It has been more than two years since its establishment, but prices still continue to rise. Everyone believes that price increases are due to inflation and wartime supply shortages. This is certainly part of the reason, but the main reason is whether the authorities' management is effective. Japan is a good example. Since the start of the war, prices have only risen by an average of about two times. This proves that even during a period of inflation, suppressing and stabilizing prices is not fundamentally impossible. I will record my humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Ineffective Investigation: Investigators always base their investigation of shop prices on their invoices from the previous month. Is checking the prices of goods with old invoices reliable? It is very unreliable. We need to know the name of the goods, but the investigator has no way to start. Not only can the name of the goods be changed, but even the names and trademarks of the factory and wholesaler can be changed at any time. Today it is Xing Ji, tomorrow it can be Fa Ji; today it is Ma brand, tomorrow it can be N brand. In this way, there is no way to investigate.</p>
<p>The Impact of Price Increases on Rationed Goods: For example, household rice, flour, sugar, oil, cigarettes, etc., and even the price increases of public utilities can also affect the rising prices of other goods. For example, the price increase of household rice also caused the price of rice in the black market to rise. (This has always been the case). Recently, the price of beer doubled, and the black market also rose by one times. This is enough to affect the price increase of other goods. For example, if the ratio of item A to item B is 1 to 10, and now item A has risen by one times, it becomes 2 to 10, and item B must of course maintain a ratio of 10 to 1, and it also rises. A affects B, B affects C, C then affects D, and it continues to affect others, so the rising trend rises as a group. Therefore, very small things often have a big impact, so to the extent possible, the prices of public goods must not be raised.</p>
<p>Raising Price Limits: Raising the price limits of many goods often affects the price increase of other goods. Now, when the black market price often exceeds it, it is instead used as an excuse for black market prices "The price limit has reached so much." The black market naturally raises the price to a commensurate level. Therefore, setting a high price limit also violates the drawbacks of the second article, which is also raising the black market price.</p>
<p>I hope that the authorities will reform what is said above. At the same time, I suggest the following methods to prevent illegal hoarding and black market price gouging:</p>
<p>Because manufacturers and wholesalers raise prices, retail stores have to buy at high prices in order to operate (not necessarily close down). So they have no choice but to sell at higher prices. To control prices at the root, it must be implemented from manufacturers and wholesalers.</p>
<p>The products of factories should be graded A, B, C, and D according to their quality, and fair prices should be set. It is not allowed to manufacture a wide variety of goods, so as to standardize wartime production, and it will also be more convenient for investigation.</p>
<p>In addition to standardization of production, the name, number, price, and sample of the manufactured goods must be submitted to the authorities for recording before they can be sold.</p>
<p>All products of factories must indicate the date of production. Price increases are not allowed for all products of this period.</p>
<p>When retail stores sell goods, the invoice must indicate the name of the goods, factory number, item number, and price. If any of these is missing, it will be considered a black market transaction.</p>
<p>Personnel must be dispatched every day to supervise and inspect rationed goods to see if they are being sold off, short-weighted, or sold on the black market.</p>
<p>A general registration should be made for all inventory, regardless of stores, private individuals, factories, etc. The authorities should issue a registration certificate stating the name of the goods, owner, quantity, and location. In the future, sales must also be registered with the authorities for transfer of ownership, and the price must be stated to prevent black market transactions.</p>
<p>Investigate all warehouses, shops, and residences for illegal stockpiling, manage them, and sell them at the price limit.</p>
<p>Dispatch personnel to investigate all specialized speculation, black market businesses, commercial firms, and companies, and force them to close down with impartiality, to reduce the hotbeds of speculation and black market manipulation.</p>
<p>For entertainment venues such as dance halls, theaters, cafes, restaurants, tea rooms, or park tickets, etc., all should be limited and not allowed to raise prices freely. Although it is not important to the overall situation, it can also cause an increase in the cost of living index, which also affects the rise in prices of other goods.</p>
<p>Reward people for reporting illegal speculation and hoarding. If it is true, give appropriate rewards.</p>
<p>Finally, the authorities must pay absolute attention to the behavior of the investigators and send special personnel to supervise them to prevent bribery and fraud. As for the investigators, they also need to be transferred and moved to different places from time to time to reduce sentiment, power, bribery, and many other shortcomings. At the same time, the cunning merchants will not be able to cope with such different newcomers every time.</p>

<p>Children's Day Special - Part 5</p>
<h3 id="e46">A Glimpse of the Shanghai Huaiyou Orphanage <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Huaiyou Orphanage is a religious organization that hosts an educational institution. It has been established for four years. During these four years, they have moved several times, from Yuyuan Road to Qingxin Girls' High School, and then from the girls' high school to its current location - Qingxin Hall at the Dafochang.</p>
<p>Although the living quarters were unstable during the four years, the educational work did not stop. The current number of children in their care is about 20. Because the place is small and temporary, they are not prepared to expand the number of children in their care. The children are between the ages of six and sixteen, both boys and girls. Most of these children ran away from home, and some were sent by the Children's Welfare Section.</p>
<p>According to the nanny, most of the children who come to the orphanage are children with problems. Because of the poor family environment, their character is affected. The approach is still to transform them in a family-like manner.</p>
<p>Their lives are relatively simple. They go to class in the morning and are divided into senior and junior classes. After 1:00 PM in the afternoon, they do handicrafts. The only craft is sewing. The clothes they sew are for their own use and are not made for others. At 8:00 PM in the evening, there is a family gathering to review their lives.</p>
<p>Reformed Children</p>
<p>There is a girl who has lived here for the longest time, and has been here for three years. At first, because she could not stand the abuse of her stepmother, she ran away in anger. After arriving at the orphanage, she often quarreled with other children and ran away again. Later, she was taken in by the Children's Welfare Section. The nanny went to see her, and she cried. She confessed that running away at the beginning was wrong, and she was willing to return to the orphanage, but according to the rules of the orphanage, children who ran away were not allowed to return. Finally, because of her plea, she was given the opportunity to return. After that, she realized that running away was not a good thing, and her behavior gradually improved. The orphanage sent her to the Public Concession Children's School, and she has been ranked first in the past two years. What she hopes for now is to learn a skill at the orphanage, so that she can serve society in the future.</p>
<p>Their current house is borrowed from Qingxin Hall. The place is narrow and they cannot live there for a long time. The most urgent problem at the moment is the problem of the house. The nanny said to me: If the house can be a little bigger, they can increase the number of children they can take in, but the current house requires a large transfer fee, which they certainly cannot afford. They hope that enthusiastic individuals or organizations in society can help them solve the problem of the house, which is what they pray for most.</p>

<p>— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Sky and Sea Wide (6)</p>
<p>"Perhaps the second Japan-Netherlands naval battle has already taken place." Kato took a deep breath of smoke and said this. Shinzhen had not yet smoked, so he sat quietly, feeling the caress of the breeze.</p>
<p>"Perhaps in this war, Germany also needs battleships very much. The main thing is air combat and submarine warfare!"</p>
<p>"They will definitely bomb London and Paris thoroughly!"</p>
<p>"Is France's Maginot Line really solid?" What is more important than this is that we should know how powerful the HMS "George V" and HMS "Prince of Wales" are."</p>
<p>"I heard that the 40,000-ton "Lion" class battleship secretly started construction this year."</p>
<p>Their center of interest, or rather, what attracted their fervent emotion, was the British Navy.</p>
<p>"However, will the United States rise up and participate in the war?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps they will join the war soon."</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with this, so they were silent for a moment. Tsunashi Nakano said in a low voice: "Shouldn't we participate in the war a little sooner?"</p>
<p>These words seemed to have touched everyone's feelings like something, and they burst into laughter involuntarily. However, the laughter disappeared immediately.</p>
<p>"What exactly will our empire do?"</p>
<p>Okazaki said this, which caused everyone to think. Now they are no longer students at the naval academy, and they are qualified to talk about such issues.</p>
<p>"Now is not the time to talk about bizarre and absurd things!"</p>
<p>"The Pacific Ocean will definitely be affected."</p>
<p>"This requires preparation..."</p>
<p>"Hmph, preparations have long been completed. Now it's just a question of how to decide. Old Tani, what do you say?"</p>
<p>Nakano asked this, and Shinzhen finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"Everything is waiting for orders."</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>The voyage from Xiamen to Sasebo was the first long voyage they had ever experienced. Various training exercises were held along the way. Once, the main gun roared with a loud bang. There was also an incident in which the small team commanded by Shinzhen was the first to salvage a hypothetical drowning person - a soy sauce barrel - during a rescue operation.</p>
<p>All the cadets' hearts were inclined towards ocean navigation, but they could not afford to lightly ignore the Sasebo naval port. Because in their hearts, a fraction of them had the idea of making this naval port their home port in the future. Moreover, because on the boards of their minds, they remembered that this naval port had played a great role during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 and the Russo-Japanese War. Whether it was the island shadow of Bantentao or the prosperity of Sakaemachi, they were all deeply imprinted in their eyes, so much so that they could never forget them.</p>

<p>Mr. Pan Yangyao sent a letter yesterday, stating: "The Dahua Factory, which I co-founded with friends, has long been closed. I sympathize with the difficulty of maintaining charitable organizations in Shanghai. Relief is really necessary. Therefore, with the consent of my colleagues, I have specially withdrawn funds at the time of closing to be used for public welfare. I am hereby donating Central Reserve Certificates worth 10,000 yuan to your organization. I know that a cup of water cannot put out a cartload of fire, but it is my humble intention to hope that the industrial and commercial circles will share this sentiment and provide funds at any time to be used for charitable purposes. This can serve as a preliminary initiative, and perhaps a good atmosphere can be created. This is what my colleagues and I earnestly pray for. Sincerely, to the New General Charity Hall." (Note: The donation will be forwarded to the New General Charity Hall and thank you on their behalf.)</p>
