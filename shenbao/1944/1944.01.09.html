<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國參戰第二年</h3>
<p>中華民國參加大東亞戰爭，已經整整的一年了。過去一年，在大東亞，是繼續擊潰英美侵略勢力和大東亞新秩序建設的邁進時期，而在參戰中國，切實一點說，還只是參戰的訓練時期，我們對於大東亞戰爭的本質，以及中國參戰為求解放求生存的意義，咋天已加論列。現在中國參加大東亞戰爭，已經經過了一年來的訓練時期，從第二年開始，必須進入實踐時期，實踐的任務，可分如下三點：</p>
<p>第一，協同盟邦爭取勝利的任務。今後的問題，可說是如何協助盟邦日本及早擊滅英美完遂戰爭的問題；具體的說，就是如何使舉國同心，貢獻物力人力，協同盟邦作戰，期於早日達成戰爭目的的問題。</p>
<p>第二，實現大東亞宣言的任務。這也是大東亞各國當前共同的任務，中國經過一年來的參戰訓練，今後必須負起更多的責任。大東亞宣言的五大綱領，是東亞諸民族近數百年來所寤寐以求的希望，也正是大東亞戰爭目的之具體表現。不過，實踐太東亞宜言，先必肅淸英美殘餘勢力，因此，完遂大東亞戰爭之勝利，尤為各國共同的先决問題。</p>
<p>第三，建設統的新中國的任務。當此决戰局勢日趨嚴重之際，對於這一個任務，中國必須有單獨負擔起來的自覺與勇氣。重慶政權尤受英美利用，繼續拖戰，削弱中國國力，破壞統一建國。南京國民政府必須講求修明政治，改善民生之道，在和平區內以此為强化政治地位的基幹，俾使渝共統治下的人民心理，一致傾向，於是渝共徒有政權之名，而無民衆之實，雖欲拖戰，亦不可得，然後統一建國，水到渠成。</p>
<p>當前中國的任務，已如上述，欲完成這三大任務，最重要的前提，便在南京國民政府，必須做到是一個為人民所擁護的堅强有力的政府。否則，任務與實踐之間，始終會保持相當的距離，而且實踐的成效也不免令人疑慮的。</p>
<p>但是，事實上南京國民政府，担負着上述三大任務，尙未能充分表示其堅强有力，因為：第一，尙未完成戰時政治體制。關於這一點，國府在過去一年的努力是不容忽視的，可是，實質上的政治效能，尙未發揮，原因是在戰時民意機關迄未成立，因此，官民一致協力，未易溝通。第二，尙未完成戰時經濟體制。這一方面，在過去一年聞，巳有相當的機構宜吿成立，巳有戰時經濟政策綱領等公布，但是，實際成續，自未足以表示戰時經濟體制之健全，即如物價高漲，漫無止境，使人民生活，困難日甚的現象，巳見一斑。第三，尙未完成戰時文化與戰時敎育體制文化方面雖有戰時文化政策綱領之規定，但實際設施，距離遼遠，至於戰時敎育體制，更未有具體確立，遑論實施了。</p>
<p>參戰第二年又吿開始。今年中國的參戰，應該開始實踐的時期了。這一點，中國的與論界必須負起更大的責任，强調宣揚參戰除了實踐以外，將完全喪大其意義，督促政府與人民一致奮起，協同盟邦日本爭取戰爭勝利·最後，我們必須重複指出，我們對於大柬亞戰爭有了自覺，依然不够，必須堅定信念，有了信念，還是不够，必須有實際行動，實踐戰爭一切任務</p>
<h3>國府參戰一周年今舉行紀念儀式　汪主席闡明今年施策重點</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　國府今（九日）上午十時，在大禮堂舉行參戰週年紀念儀式。由國府委員兼外長褚民誼，主持一切。</p>
<p>南京八日中央社電　今九日國府參戰周年紀念日，中日滿三國為示共司紀念起見，定於令日晚十時至十一時，由我國汪院長，日本東條言相，滿洲國張國務總理，舉行交歡廣播。屆時由中央廣播電台轉播全國。</p>
<p>南京中央社八日電　九日為我國參戰一周年紀念，首都中外記者，特以左列各問題，恭叩主席，蒙一一答覆。茲撮要恭錄如次：—</p>
<p>問：參戰第二年施策，將以何者為重點？</p>
<p>答：余於元旦談話，經巳指出今年工作之重點，應一本歷來之方針·向肅正思想，保障治安，增加生產三方面，為更進一步之努力。此三方面工作，有其連帶之關係，不可偏廢。若就其輕重緩急之程序而言，則過去一年，對於前兩點所用之力，實際上比較對後一點所用之力為大·今年的一年，則增產運動當為重點中之重點。</p>
<p>問：政治力對地方之滲透，及增產之施策如何？</p>
<p>答：目前增產施策，以義戰養民為二大目標。養戰必須養民，養民即所以養戰。欲求養民養戰同時做到，則不惟當維持厚旺之生產力，以從事於生產，尤應發展所有之生產力，以從事於增產。語其急要：　為耕地之改良與開展。　為農業技術之改良，農業知識之普及。　為農村靑少年及中堅農民之組成與訓練。進而講求農村社會之改造。　為與衣食關係最切之輕工業，如紡織工業，麵粉工業等之復興。現正由主管部會，審議具體方案，即行付諸實施。至於政治力對地方之滲透，今年的一年，將隨塲產運動，及保陣治安，　正思想之工作，由都市而深入農村，固不待言。於此猶有應注重者兩事，其一為橫的方面，打破地域觀念之畸形變態。其二為縱的方面，消滅中間階層之種種隔閡，務期遵行國父完成地方自治之遺訓，以强化中央指導力為經，以充實民衆自治力為　，使政府之意旨，能一一普及於民衆，民意情亦能一一上達於政府。</p>
<p>問：國民黨强化與黨政關係如何？</p>
<p>答：强化國民黨之意義，在充實基礎，加强活動，使黨員深入民衆·奉行黨的主義，及國策，做推動的工作，及引導的工作，在民衆中充實黨的基礎。亦即充實政府的基礎，並力　事變前黨衙門化，及黨政對立的積弊，使黨務工作與政治工作，獲得一元化之推進。以黨的活動輔助政治之發展，使政府與民衆，打成一片，共同負起完遂戰爭，興華保亞之使命。</p>
<p>問：關於大東亞宣言之具體實踐，請示其要點。</p>
<p>答：大東亞宣言是大東亞戰爭在進展中所產生，東亞民族自存自衛相倚相扶之結晶品，是結集東亞民族，完遂戰爭之原動力，是建設大東亞共榮圈之指導方針。大東並戰爭之最後完遂，固有賴於大東亞宣言之實踐。而大東亞宣言呈之具實踐，又有待於大東亞戰爭之完遂。今日之事，以决戰勝利為第一目的，以精誠團結，為第一要義。故如何分工合作，增進總力，如何掃蕩叛逆，發固陣營，如何粉碎英美殘餘勢力之最後掙扎，實為大東亞宣簽字國應盡之義務，亦為東亞各國家民族，對自巳對東亞應有之權責。</p>
<p>谷大使特發表談話</p>
<p>南京八日中央社電　國府參戰週年紀念日，駐華谷大使發表談話如下：</p>
<p>中華民國國民政府，自對英美布吿宣戰，為完遂大東亞戰爭，發表與我國在軍事上，政治上，經濟上，完全協力之宣言以來，迄已一載。今日値此意義深長之一週年紀念日，回顧一年來大東亞之各種動向，再觀今日大東亞建設之成果，着着實現，實不禁感慨。溯國民政府於大東亞戰爭爆發後，即發表宣言，表明决意，謂國民政府為會現建設東亞新秩序之協同目的，決以同同甘共苦，確固不拔之精神，臨此難局。闡明中國在臨戰體制下，與日本同甘共苦，對日軍任有力之後方援助，另一方面並努力加強政治力，培義國力，以備他日與日本立於同一戰線，打倒英美</p>
<p>夫大東亞戰爭之目的，在由英美多年來之侵略支配中解放東亞，恢復東亞民族本來之地位，樹立平等互惠之國際關係。此次戰爭不僅限於日本，實為大東亞諸民族全體共同之戰爭。是故在可能範圍內，以實力保衛東亞，為東並民族之希望。在國民政府方面，因鑒於英美之不稍反省，猶再圖主配東亞。英美空軍亦在本國領域內出沒擾亂，自更須以實力協力完遂大東亞戰爭。故遂於去年一月九日，對英美宜戰。誠如參戰布吿中注主席閣下所宣示者，即中國當悉其全力，與友邦日本，協力一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放，而期共同建設，以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序。故中國之參戰，為中國國民之自覺，欲掃滅近百年來英美之侵略勢力，永遠脫離次殖民地之地位，決意與日本協力，完遂此大東亞解放戰，努力建設共榮圈之結果。相信由此實踐孫總理之遺志，大東亞戰爭在諸戰之中，即將英美之勢力逐出東亞，大東亞之建設，正逐漸實現。</p>
<p>目前中日兩國，因同盟條約之締結，已基於平等互惠之原則，樹立永久親善協力關係。另一方面，並有大東亞共同宣言之發表，成為大東亞諸民族之共同理想。亞洲更生之黎明已屆，誠深堪同慶。然而英美猶以維持現狀為觀念，以再支配東亞為戰爭目的，對於東亞民族之自覺與團結，欲於萌芽之中，加以芟除，故於焦慮之下，極力反攻，戰局仍極形激烈，今已至决定東亞民族永久運命之决戰階段，吾人為擊潰敵方獨善之優越感，使彼等認識，「世界非英美之世界」，故應知當盡全力摧擊敵方之野心。並望中國方面，於此時把握此種情勢，以必勝之信念，努力完遂聖戰。</p>
<p>華北協力完遂戰爭</p>
<p>北平八日中央社電　華北政會委委員長王克敏氏，以九日為我國參戰周年紀日，特發表談話。大意謂自我參戰以來，即根據同生共死之精神，結集全國之總力，與盟邦日本並肩作戰，以期獲得最後之勝利。華北政委會於此更盡最大之努力，以改革政治機構，加強決戰體制，強化剿共工作，確保治安。同時更擴大生產基地，力謀物資之增收，強力開發資源等，皆已獲得顯著之成果。又會推進關於增強戰力之一切工作，如肅正思想，昂揚必勝信念，激發決戰意識，促進新建設工作之實施，均為要著。華北於參戰一年來，已作有效之努力，以協力盟邦日本完遂戰爭。今日之大東亞戰爭，已進入決戰階段，中國民衆深信唯有完成大東亞戰爭，始能完成中國之獨立白主。余衷心切望我國民衆，繼續努力，厲行新國民運動，刷新生活以增產剿共為目標，一致協力完成我國應負之任務焉。</p>
<h3>久保田抵京</h3>

<h3>印臨時政府遷緬鮑斯特發表聲明　促印人奮起爭取祖國獨立</h3>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　自由印度臨時政府，已於七日由昭南遷至緬甸，印主席鮑斯是日下午假此間廣播霄台，向其祖國同胞廣播，說明臨時政府已遷至緬甸，喚醒印人從速奮起共同奮鬥，爭取祖國之獨立。</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　鮑斯七日上午偕婦人部長拉克西米，秘書薩哈伊等要員，乘飛機抵此間，到塲歡迎者，有緬甸巳莫國家代表，日駐緬澤田大使，印僑代表，印駐緬國民軍將士等多人。飽斯與各歡迎人員寒喧畢，即檢閱國民軍，後乘車赴緬甸國家代表官邸，拜會巴漠氏，又訪日陸軍最高指揮官分別致謝，後赴臨時辦公處，發表聲明，宣布印度臨時政府巳遷至緬甸，印度獨立運動已進入最後之實踐階段，繼假此間廣播電台向印度民衆廣播，吿以臨時政府已遷至緬甸，後接見記者團，發表談話，闡明其决意，謂决擊滅英·美勢力而後已。</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　江特鮑斯以印度獨立運動今已完成最後準備，七日下午會見日緬記者團，發表談話，大意謂：臨時政府遷緬後，余自不待言，與吾同前進之印度人，亦自信開始進攻德里已有把握。印度國內之運動，英目的均在求祖國之獨立，關於其方法，最近尤以一般靑年，悉認非執武器奮鬥不能獲得獨立，國內無武器之鬥爭同志，現正呼應國外執武器活動之同志共同奮鬥。據余所得確息，印度國內之印度軍，擬一俟我軍開始行動，即行呼應余所率之國民軍。今後吾等應採之鬥爭方法，厥為武力抗爭，吾今自信異常堅固，蓋因吾人具有實力，印度國內民衆及英印軍中之印度兵，已越吾等之公同行動，且我等需要外援時，尙有日本及盟邦諸國之援助。</p>
<p>視察安達曼島</p>
<p>安達曼八日中央社電　鮑斯上月二十九日曾赴安達曼羣島視察，並向該島之一萬八千印人致訓，喚起印度民衆一致奮起，為印度獨立而擊滅英美，飽斯氏一行旋往布雷爾訪晤日軍最高指揮官，繼赴民政部詢問島內情形，並接見當地要人，又赴羅斯島，是晚即下榻於該島前最高長官邸。次日十一時往布列阿緻兵　參加安達曼空前熟烈之民衆大會，鮑斯於羣衆合唱印度國歌中，親手携國旗並即席舉行演說，大旨受英國壓制之安連曼居民，現巳由日本代為解放，且行將併入印度自身之國土，印人現僅有二途可循，一為流血攻進德里，另一為途中戰死而已。民衆聞聆莫不惑奮，均高呼飽斯主席萬歲，印度獨立萬歲，大會即於此熱烈情緒中散會。鮑斯氏一行復又視察島內各項設備，目覩昔日英國幽閉印度獨立志士之巨大監獄，感慨不巳，是夜在羅斯鳥宿留一脊三十一日晨離安達曼島而去。</p>
<p>日軍當局談話</p>
<p>仰光八日中央社電　緬甸方面日陸軍最高指揮官，頃就自由印度臨時政府遷至緬甸事談稱：今自由印度臨時政府與印度國民軍同時進至緬甸，吾人不勝歡迎之至。鮑斯主席於去歲十月二十一日在昭南聲明樹立臨時政府時，大東亞各地印僑無不翕然投其麾下，該政府之機構乃日趨完備，印度國民軍之威武精神，亦頓顯振作，進擊印度英軍之態勢，巳逐步推進，印度獨立運動，至此乃行步入實踐階段。其所予美英之極大行動，茲已勿庸贅言，印度民衆之歡欣，實出想像之外，夏國志士咸必倔起與其相呼應，共建自由獨立新國家。緬甸巴莫國家代表　於大東亞會議時已表明援助印度之决意，今歡迎該政府遷緬甸，實充分顯示緬甸政府與民衆全力援助印度臨時政府之决心，自由印度臨時政府之目的，乃在使三百年來呻吟於英國壓迫下之祖國獲得解放，倘印度不獲解放，則緬甸之獨立亦難臻於完璧。今後緬甸方面日軍除澈底擊潰頑敵之反攻外，更願進一步協力印度國民軍對英之進擊，而期印度獨立早日實現。</p>
<h3>日陸空軍舉行　近代分列式　大元帥陛下親臨檢閱</h3>

<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明决與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保璋洽安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之完遂，乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，且變本加屬，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其曇力已次第為友邦日本陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平民。在渝方分子，甘受英美為使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後併吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府為此宜告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘曇，以謀中國之復興、東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦友好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提　，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序，德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋。迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有所貢獻，凡我國民，當只此為實現　國父亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之獲得，　擊於此。其一德一心，　力始終，以貫徹此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>我參戰周年紀念　蔡大使發表感言　團結截止英美侵略野心</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　我國駐日大使蔡培，以九日為我國參戰一周年紀念日，特於八日發表感言，茲誌其原文如次：去年今日，我國民政府對英·美毅然宣戰，同時友邦日本與我國簽訂交還專管租界並協助我國收回各國在華租界及撤廢治外法權之協定，此一紀念日，實為中國歷史上得到解放，而進於獨立自主最光樂之一具。回顧一年以來，友邦日本一本道義精神履行諾言，極力協助我國自强，並將中·日基本條約改訂為中·日同盟條約，以平等互惠為原則，益可證明日本對我之誠意，凡我國人當有同感。猶憶去年今日國府宣戰之後，立即從事於戰時體制之確立，組織最高國防委員會，集中權力以為措施，尤置其施政重點於訓練民衆，保障治安，增强生產，安定民生，凡此數者均於戰爭勝利相關至鉅，盡欲圖大東亞戰爭之完遂與共榮圈建設之完成，必須全東亞各國家，各民族舉其所存總力貢獻於戰爭。如今日友邦日本之所為，無論人力，物力凡為戰爭所需者，罔不爭先恐後，盡量貢獻，犧牲小我，而謀大我，此種精神，舉國一致，吾人日覩之情，惟有希望國人一致嚇起，由共甘苦進而與之同生死，協力戰爭，以達到最後之勝利，中國如能保障自由獨立，有待於大東亞戰爭之勝利，無論何人不能否認，値此中國參戰第二年開始之日，所願特加强調者，厥惟戰爭意識充奮之一點，吾人稍一回顧歷史，細心研究事實，便知中國淪於次殖民地，使中國命運悲慘無似者非日本，而為英·美。戰爭史上可恥之鴉片戰爭戎首為誰，國人豈巳忘之，美國遠渡重洋，乘美西戰勝之機，併吞與美國國防無關之菲島，其意非欲以之為根據侵略東亞而何。英·美侵略東亞，事實俱在，故盟邦日本一對英。美宣戰，東亞十億人民無不同仇敵愾，</p>
<h3>新不列顛島　美軍陷苦境　日軍正予以猛烈邀擊</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電　美軍於新不列顚島格羅斯特登陸後，刻正擬進犯波爾根　之日軍陣地，但遭日軍猛烈之邀擊，已陷於苦境。據新幾內亞反軸心軍司令部合衆社特派員之報道，美軍巳與日軍展開極熾烈戰　，傳美海軍正向前綫增派砲兵及坦克車部隊。又麥克沃塞司令部發言人亦曾宣稱：美軍之陸上進攻作戰極為還緩，日軍之抵抗甚烈一致奮起，不惜犧牲一切，今日國內或尙有未能現解之人，一方面以為英·美物資豐富，足以戰勝一切國家，一方面以為英·美將來待我必厚，為自身計，惟祈其必勝，倘然有此觀念，更屬錯誤·英·美物力固不弱，但全東亞資源更無窮，尤為英·美致命之處者，為其人力有限，且戰爭目的不明，人民自無鬥志，更非如東亞各民族一致為興替存亡而戳力效命，故大東亞戰爭二年來之經過，足使吾人勝利之信念愈堅，要而言之，英·美帝國主義不打倒，東亞無獨立，今當我圖參戰周年之日，凡我國人，務宜一致團結，舉其總力與盟邦日本協力打倒英。美帝國主義，戢止其政治侵略東亞野心之死灰復燃也。</p>
<h3>德軍發言人　談西歐防禦</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊；德軍發言人昨首次述及西歐沿海德國所建防禦工程之實力曰，倘英。美進攻歐陸，其軍隊必這屠殺，蓋德國在歐陸大西洋沿海海峽及北海沿岸，巳建就數千歲固定之防禦據點，配有八公分半之大砲及長射程重砲六千餘門之多。可以洞穿鐵甲之大砲三千餘門，沿海區域所埋之水雷則有數百萬枚之多，以上沿海防綫總長二千一百公里，挪威沿海防綫則長二千五百餘公里，該處所置大炮約有一千七百餘尊，自比里尼斯至那維克之歐洲防禦鋼壁，今已建築就緒，其後復有深長之防禦建築，德國機械化部隊可開至各地作戰之計劃亦吿完成。反軸心機時至該處偵察，或已窺知德軍之防禦實力。故其進攻迄今仍遲遲未發。</p>
<h3>國際紅會呼籲　優待戰俘　要求交戰國遵守條約</h3>
<p>日內瓦八日中央社電　國際紅十字會委負會，致文各交戰國，呼籟善待戰虜，內稱：近曾要求交戰國，遵守各項條約及特別宣吿，對戰虜及幽禁之平民，其法律地位不予變史。按照日內瓦公約第二條，對戰虜待遇之規定，不得對戰虜採報復手段，該委員會茲復迫切　求各交戰國或關禁者，不得採用任何報復行為，彼等或已投降，或從不參加作戰，概作無助之囚應予善待。該委員會進而力言，戰爭工具日加兇暴，使大衆平民及非軍事財物，甚而不可復得具有文化價値之物，同受池魚之殃，使該委員會日益焦灼。按國際公法之規定，對非戰鬥人員及財物之威脅損害，應予避免，今茲戰火遍地，巳被置而不顧，該委員會職責所在義不容辭，茍認為必要，必起而干預，現在戰爭使一切有價事物，尤其道義行為，均有盪然無餘之慮，此項呼籲深感切要。</p>
<h3>美造船職工　罷工潮嚴重</h3>
<p>阿根廷京城八日中央社電　據華盛頓電稱：美國勞工界之不安仍極深刻，工潮頻起，大有一波未平一波又起之勢，六日菲列得爾非亞地方古拉姆造船廠，有美國職員會議系海員及船工公所所屬船工八千五百人發生罷工情形，相當嚴重，一時恐難解决。</p>
<h3>維特勃思克區　惡戰進行中</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社軍事通訊員塞托留斯上尉報吿稱：維特勃斯克之第二期戰事，已釀成一場惡戰，星期四敵軍向維特勃斯克，波洛斯克鐵道猛攻，其目的在越過鐵道向西南推進，以攻維特勃斯克防軍之背，此項企圖已被德防軍所阻。東綫南路之德軍，自普里貝特起至薩普魯柴一帶，正猛烈抵抗蘇軍之攻擊，整個局勢，約略如下：數日前，敵軍先鋒已抵達前此之蘇波邊界，但伐吐丁將軍之右翼已稍緩進，該方面之敵軍壓力亦非如何猛烈。伐吐丁將軍之中錢，由貝迪契夫，加薩丁向布格河上游之攻擊目的，在進取敏尼薩數量優越之敵軍略有進展，德後備軍巳能阻止敵軍之突破·伐吐丁將軍之南震，巳在貝拉耶塞爾科夫東南與柯內夫將軍之部隊接觸，因此基洛伏格勒一帶之德軍背後巳受威脅，在基洛伏格勒以北，德軍以坦克車反攻後，局勢已稍好轉，但聶伯河大灣之惡戰則有增無已。此後敵軍在東南前綫作戰之目的，當為句圍尙在聶伯河套作戰之德軍，或迫其向布格河之下游撤退，目下蘇軍當局似尙有能力補充其受創部隊，故冬季攻勢尙未達其頂點，至於此項高峯何時可達到，則尙未可逆睹。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：敵軍在溫和之氣候下繼續進攻，自尼柯波爾至維特勃斯克之德軍防綫，當一九四一年至一九四二年之冬季戰事時，溫度常在四十至五十度以下，東綫之氣候為百年來未有之酷寒，以至影響作戰。今年眞正之蘇聯冬季尙未來臨，實屬反常之現象，據星期五前錢消息，過去二十四小時內，敵軍最重之壓力，施之於貝迪契夫以南與貝拉耶塞爾科夫西南之區域，蘇軍在該兩點調到生力軍參戰，其目的在求繼續向南進展·同時敵軍又側面進攻塞爾加西區與基洛伏格勒附近，該城迤東現有劇戰，德方宣稱：進攻基洛伏格勒之蘇軍大部被阻，在激戰中，敵方損失坦克軍四十一輛，若干區域之戰事仍在進行中，德軍坦克車隊在該城以北發動反攻，將蘇軍擊退·齊托米爾區亦有大戰，敵軍在普洛伊斯克以西之攻勢，已不若數日前之激烈，故該區局勢無重要之改變，蘇軍在維特勃斯克進攻之目標，在牽掣德軍，該城四圍現有猛烈之戰事。據德方息，蘇軍之活動，集中於該城西北之德軍陣地，以岡使該城陷於孤立，德軍在該區擊壞敵軍坦克車四十九輛，據蘇軍俘虜稱：蘇軍步兵兩師一團與裝甲車隊一團，在維特勃斯克東南之戰事中被殲。</p>
<h3>蘇波問題　土深表關懷</h3>
<p>斯丹埠八日中央社電　德國新聞社引土耳其政界消息稱，土耳其間接對於蘇波問題之現階段，頗為關懷，因該事件可為反軸心團政治關係之試騐，又可為保持小國權益及大西洋憲章效力之試金石。對眞理報最近反對威爾基之意見，土耳其極感興趣。有關當局對於表面其態度之言論，仍極議愼，但均具有以為英國將如有對南王彼得二世及蒂托游擊政府之事件之同樣手段，以犧牲共同交戰國之政治利益，而對蘇聯讓步。</p>
<h3>圣維多利　德美軍巷戰</h3>
<p>里期本八日中央社電　南義戰綫西部戰區德軍，自五日以來即於卡西諾南方六英里聖維多列地方與進攻之美第五軍展開熾烈巷戰，美軍由東北及西南兩方進攻該市，德軍現正猛烈抵抗。</p>
<h3>郭培爾演說</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：德宣傳部長郭培爾，星期五對自東錢回來及駐於柏林區之高級將領發表演說，解釋戰爭中之軍事及政治行動之關係，謂政治上之手法及軍事上工具相併合，則可產生無躬之精力，遂可　致最後勝利。</p>
<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>論墨子—獻給張一鵬先生—</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>中國的封建家族主義，並非現在才有。墨　在「尙賢」文中，曾批評當時的政治說：「親戚則使之，無故富貴，面目姣好則使之，……是故不能治百人者，使處乎千人之官，不能治千人者，使處乎萬人之官」。這樣結果，政治就會陷於「飢而不得食，寒而不得衣，勞而不得息，亂而不得治」的狀態　。</p>
<p>墨子是生於周敬王時代的人，就是西曆紀元前五百年的人物，但他的話，却好像針對着一九四四年的中國政治所發的　刺話。現在試觀「航而不得食，寒而不得衣」的人，在上海一隅究竟有多少呢？前年普摺山莊所收埋的屍體，總共為三萬一千七十具。其中，兒童屍體為一萬八千八百零五具，大人屍體為一萬二千二百六十五具。這就是說，每月平均為二千五百八十九具强，每日平均為八十五具强·去年十一月十九日，上海突然被寒波所襲，溫度　減，即在這一天，普善山莊所收集的屍體，單第一區一處，竟有七十六具之多·去年聖誕節前後，曾非常的寒冷，所以在這樣的一個慶祝日，上帝喚去的人數，眞够可觀了。安徒生著的有名童話「售賣火柴的女郞」，一面聽着聖覽節的鐘聲，一面因寒風刺骨，就想把兜售的貨物——火柴，刮火取暖，然而在不知不覺中，竟凍斃於十字街頭。在上海這類「售賣火柴的女郞」，眞是不勝枚舉，然而對於上海人已經見空司愼，所以王海人决不像安徒生一樣，少見多怪，還取來作童話的資料，當然對於上海人，則更不够聳人聽聞和驚心動魄的悲劇素材了。一般人，雖然對於凍死者和餓死者（此二者不能嚴格地區別出來，因為凍死者同時多半也是餓死者）表示同情，然而談到「怎樣處理這個問題」，却是個少數人無能為力的。雖然有句普通話：「有飯大家吃」，然而此處所說的「大家」，幾乎全是赤條條的棵體而凍斃者，所以如按照「有飯大家吃」的話來實行，則上海人今年就不得不單單穿着一件襯衫，牙根撕抖地過此嚴冬了。何况，在這樣的一個社會裏，如打算澈底　踐對人類的同情心，則本人頗有捷足先登，作普善山莊顧客的可能性。所以現在有很多人，雖然在道傍看見一批即將凍斃和餓死的人，也只好心中說幾遍「沒有法子」，斜視而過。</p>
<p>再來看一下，這個社會中「勞而不得息，亂而不得治」的人、是如何的汗牛充棟。</p>
<p>去年底，張一鵬先生曾對我說過：「最近上海的戶口米，每人不過一升，然而一人一升，無論如何是不能够維持生活的，所以在百無辦法之餘，只好求助於「黑市」米。假如上海沒有「黑市」米，則上海的俄殍將會達到驚人的數字吧！」這一番話，的確有三思的價値。眞的，假如上海「戶口米」外的米源斷絕，恐怕上海老早就發生「食米恐慌」了。想到這一點，我們就對於披星戴月，像拖曳着「瓦爾加」(Vloga）河船般的細長行列。背着米，蹣跚地踏進上海來的人們，就不能不多少加以穩遇了。他們甚至不能坐電軍（坐車就需要付售票員以票價以外的特別通融費），他們有時被警察毆打，或被趕得屁滾尿流，棄米而逃，這算可以够得上「勞而不得息」的人們了。然而就法律觀點言，他們是統制經濟的破壞者，當然必須加以取締。如不取締他們，則各地白米收買工作，就會大受影響。話又說回來，上海食米的配給情形，常此以往，如不改善，反而嚴禁私米輸入，則上海必然立刻爆發「食米恐慌」。所以，他」們才是眞正「亂而不得治」的人。</p>
<p>說起來，最近的上海，「亂而不得治」的現象，幾乎普遍皆是。姑且翻閱一下，我手邊的一九四二年版「上海日本商工會議所年報」，所登載的上海華人薪水階級生活費之指數，一九三六年平均法幣一元購買力、暫定為一○○，則一九四二年十一月的購買力，成為五·四一；換言之，一九三六年月薪一百元的人們，假定在這個期間從未增新，那末一九四二年十一月的薪水，只等於五元四角錢了·一九四二年十一月以後，因官方禁止發表這類指數，所以現在究竟降落到何種程度，實在不敢妄加猜測。總而言之，按我們自己生活的實際體騐，可以說，現在的一百元，合不上往者的一元錢。假定這個體騐是正確的，那末國民政府部長級的正規收入，縱令加算上各種津貼黑馬費等，也不會到五千元，所以按收入這一點來設，尙不及往昔五十元的薪俸者。等而下之，至於中下級公務員的收入，儘管不足維持生活，但仍然活在人間，這豈不是一件今古奇聞麽？例如，在米一石非二千五百元不可的時代，月俸只一千元，那末究竟怎樣能活下去呢？這無須費詞，誰都可以知這是不够的。這一不足部份，則不能不由某種不規矩的方法來塡補的。這一「某種方法」，就大成了問題。我認為這就是社會萬惡的源泉。例如，本來學生可以安分守己，用不者越俎代庖，示威搗亂，政府只要用一紙命令、賭窟和鴉片館就可以關門大吉，然而這些消金窟　管是社會嗚　而攻的衆矢之的，可是仍舊屹然存在，歸根結底，個中原因，就不能不求之於「某種方法」了。街頭上的巡捕向烟紙店要保護費，其原因畢竟在於「某種方法」、軍管理電話公司的下級職員，假「軍」的護符，以求　端取消電話，勒索鉅款，其原因也畢竟在於這個「某種方法」上。最近特別常常聽到維持「法律尊嚴」的法官，知法犯法，醜態百出，遺也許是因為目前法官的月俸，不得不由「某種方法」塡補的部份過大所致。老實說，只有這個「某種方法」才是「亂而不得治」現象的經濟基礎。爲了根本剷除這樣的社會萬惡現象，則必須首先摧毀其經濟原因，例如抑止貨幣價値的不斷迅速跌落，是當前迫不容緩的工作。</p>
<p>刺激這種社會萬惡的經濟原因，愈益發揮其凶燄者，就是現代政洽的缺陷。消滅這種原因，為安定經濟的最好辦法，這一點差不多早已成為一種常鐵了。現代政治的最大缺陷，就是墨子所說的「　戚則使之，無故富貴，面目姣好則使之」的封建家族主義，與「不能治百人者，使處乎千人之官，不能治千人者，使處乎百人之官」的徇情政治，這一點，在今天簡直可以說是公開的秘密。對症下藥的辦法，就像墨子老早設過的「古者聖王，……不黨父兄，不偏貴富，不變顏色，賢者，舉而上之，富而貴之，以為官長」。現在，幸而南京政府舉出一位賢者，而任司法行政部長，這就是張一鵬先生。年近七十，一向身穿　素棉袍，非徒步即乘三等電車的司法行政部長，可以說是南京政府的一個希奇現象。我相信勤儉自持的司法部長之存在本身，是現政治的一個最好鼓舞。他正如墨子所說：「堂高三尺，士階三等，茅茨不翦，采橡不刮，食土　，豎土刑，糲梁之食，　　之羹，夏日葛衣，冬日鹿裘（太史公自序）」一探，是愛好簡單的自然生活。墨子正因為他有這樣生活態度，所以他在盡中，字裏行間，充溢着對老百姓的無限同情。墨子說過：「民有三患，飢而不得食，寒而不得衣，勞而不得息」，張先生由於自身的生活，一定也很明白，現在上海市民正苦惱於這三患中的吧！職是之故，全體上海市民對於張先生此次任司法部長。都抱有絕大的期待。這是因馬政府，第一次「以尙賢使能為政也」；同時，這是因為上海市民，都在迫切地期待着，藉張先生的努力，「飢而不得食，寒而不得衣，勞而不得息，亂而不得治」的現象，消形滅跡於人間。</p>
<p>敢請先生，以事實表現，回答上海人這種期待。（大魯譯）</p>

<p>我做了二十三年的老百姓，忽然搖身一變，要做官吏了，老百姓總是說眞話的，官吏未必一定說眞話，好在現在尙未就職，還是一個老百姓，可以與諸位說眞話。我先講允許做官的原因，有三點：第一，感情作用，我與汪主席雖屬同學，民國元年之後，從未見過一面，就是還部以來，我亦不應往見，因為我年紀已老，　官已久，何必去擾他的「　肝之勞」呢。去年汪主席到滬，兩次約談，又經過周財政部長，陳市長，及其他在京朋友約勤馬，如果學「段十木踰垣而避」，未免太覺不近人情了·第二，視察性質，我在上海所聽到的，對於南京政府的施政，不滿意的居多，民生困苦，我亦是受害中的一人，但是為什麽造成這種現象，政府當局，是否可做而不做，或者已做而不可能，我很想比較得到一點眞相，亦同時使老百姓明暸一些實際。人家說，要深入民問，我以為已深入民間，就不妨深入政間。第三，思想問題，全面和平，已成大東亞今日最急切之事，而全面和平的種種方策，無諭是友邦所主張的，南京政府所主張的，我總覺得隔靴搔擾。我以為戰爭，外交，宣傳，都是治標之策，要根本上做起，應該是要比賽民德，民德上了軌道，不必求全面和平，自然「水到渠成」·古人說得好，「衣食足而後知廉恥」，這是政治上積極的力量，而能催促民德上軌道，就是司法上消極的力量。從這三點出發，司法行政部施政方針，我雖然尚未就職，不能具體說明，但是用人取廉潔，經費求充足，各級法院檢察署辦案，不論刑事民事，要迅速公正，這是我素來的宗旨。好在前任男部長，對於這三事，已經大有基礎，只要加些推進功央，或者可以達到目的，所怕的年紀太老，精神不彀，那是事實上的障礙，無可如何的。今天與在座各位談話，實在愉快感激之至。</p>

<p>本屆助金不敷甚鉅　有待各界繼續輸將</p>
<p>本報主辦大東亞戰爭國民常　　覽會第一日，同時發給第六屆助學金申請書，前來參觀展覽會，並素取之學生，至為衆多，全日共計發出新舊生甲請書九千餘份，其中尤以新生佔大多數，自上午九時起申請學生，即格繹不絕，道至午後，人數驟場，勢如潮湧，自華　　店大門口列隊起，迤　向南京路外　折至仁記路。迄五時為止，計發出新生六千餘份，　生三千餘份，共計九千餘份。凡此現象，足微生活嚴重，影響十弟失學，至為普遍。</p>
<p>請各界繼續輸將</p>
<p>以昨日申請學生之衆，與後來絡經不絕，則本報現有金額，相差何啻數倍。目覩諸生不辭遠道而來，且於寒風凜冽中，鵠候達數小時之久，其懷繼續求學之熱望，與夫待助之親切，自子待言。然以助金之不數分配，常使同人等惶惶不安，深信各界人士，必具同感，希望云以往精神，作育英才，慷慨捐　，俾濟寒學子，不致中途輟學，本報助學工作，得以順利推進，胥有賴於熟心人士有力之援助。</p>

<h3>新聯會昨晚舉行　參戰演講大會　由張司法行政部長主講</h3>
<p>中央社訊　自盟邦日本展開擊滅英美戰爭之後，去年一月九日國府亦相　宣吿參戰，大東亞之黎明，已在目前，值此國府參戰一週年紀念，上海新聞聯合昨（八日）晚七時半，假戈登路美琪大戲院，主辦「慶祝國府參戰一周紀念演講大會，」恭請新任司法行政部長張一鵬先生主講，計到有主席團大陸新報尾板與市（任　鵬代），中華日報許力求（將　章代，）平報金雄白，新中國報袁殊（魯風代），新申報森山喬（日高清摸磋代），新聞報吳　　（曹仲之代），及新聞聯合會總幹事任　鵬等，總衆數達二千餘人，盛况空前，首由主席　雄白致辭，略謂：在國府參戰一周年前夕，新聞聯合會同人以萬分熱烈情緒，舉行此參戰演講大會，目前大東亞戰爭已屆決戰階段，中國即已參戰，政府人民應如何協力，完逐大東亞戰爭，今晚特請新任司法行政部長演講，對我們定有極多指示云云。</p>
<p>張氏演講</p>
<p>繼請張司法行政部長演講，略微：今日國府參戰剛一年，我們在此一年中，可謂時間太短，也可謂時間太長，蓋已過三百六十日之久，而人民無日不在吃苦中，我們若怕吃苦而希望參戰時間短，但此為我們戰志之喪失，因此我們應不怕吃古，而不怕參戰時間延長，現在戰爭前後方，應為一致，如後方亭樂，則前方戰事決不會成功，我們雖無一兵一族赴前方，惟在後方當以物賽供給參戰，這一年來我们供给參戰，已不在少數，不過人民以節省剩下之物資，必日益減少，故須在供給物資外，後方尙須生產，如此才能源源不絕，以物資供給參戰，本人尙希望政府供給人民種種生產工具，於是政府人民一致總動員，協力參戰，才能完遂大東亞戰爭。演講完畢，即放映鉅片「怒海雷動，」迄十一時始畢。</p>
<p>代評</p>
<h3>贈張一鵬先生　五團聯合歡送會席上致詞</h3>
<p>— 陳彬</p>
<p>我個人的感想，這次張氏出任司法行政部長有三種意義：</p>
<p>第一，張氏與汪主席是老同學，「同窗學友」，同學是最親　的朋友。一個國家領袖，平時深居簡出，所以最需要經由，可以無話不談，無言不盡，尤其是民間疾苦情形，同時，來自民間的靜友，更為適當。</p>
<p>第二，我們向來主張好人政府，廉潔政治，所以國府起用張氏，認為是非常顯明的舉措。就是說起用張氏，等於練就一師兵隊，業不為過。現在行政院共有是一個一部」，至少應有一半的部，起用民間人才，不一定陷於上海或江蘇，只需有聲望有才具，各地都可無色。當然，我們不是說現任的部長不能勝任。可是，希望政治更趨進步，自然也不是幾個長官輪流調換所可收效的。所以，僅僅起用張氏一人，還覺不夠。</p>
<p>第三，政府能夠起用張氏，是說明了政府從民間甄報人才，當然是極好現象，可是，從與民接近一點以　，政府還只做到一部份。我們認為進一步的從遠見立民意機關，真正　通人民意見，才能完成理想的民主政治。</p>
<p>此外，我們對於張氏的期待，自然也特別的熱烈與廣大，這裡先提出兩點：</p>
<p>第一，近來張氏所發表的談話，僅以司法行政為範圍，這在張氏個人，或許是在本位上說話，可是，我們民間立場，認為不夠，民間的期待，也決定不止此。我們認為張氏職掌司法，司法固然要緊，然而整個政治尤其要緊，所以必須參加整個政治。老實說，整個政治無辦法，司法本身也決無辦法的。</p>
<p>第二，張氏此次受命，其奮勇精神值得佩服。希望只想前進，不思後退，恩澤被民，名垂永久，則張氏成功，亦即國民政府成功，人民自亦樂為後盾。</p>

<p>經濟界　譯評</p>
<h3>注視物價問題</h3>
<p>最近生活日用品價格的上漲，實可寒心，但當局對此袖手旁觀，殊不可解。這種物價的急漲，在民生問題上有重大的影響，並使中國的民間資本再從事商品囤積，工業生產更　停滯。高物價如何防害戰時經濟的建設設，如何阻害戰力的增强，母待贅述，是以此種情形，絕對不能長此放任。</p>
<p>物價漲的原因，一般地說來，有通貨方面的原因，以及物資流通不暢，囤積行為等；要解除這些原因，在現在的政洽經濟的條件下，固甚困難，但不是不可能的，何况當同祗要一舉手之勞，毅然抑制物價，就可以解消這原因的一半，遺須視當局的决心如何。</p>
<p>囤積和暴利行為的取締，亦為有效的物價對策，最近的囤積和暴利行為，正由一般所謂統制機構下的公司商號在那兒與風作浪，而監督機關亦復不以為怪。我們渴望統制機構本身自動的發揮其監督機能。</p>
<p>收買棉紗布而發動的政府　力，會使民間資本家一度畏服、但現在故能復萌，仍做其追求利潤的好夢。這些傾向，都和中國戰時經濟的建設相仿。中國戰時經濟建設的目標，乃在生產的振興與民生的安定。然而生產也好，民生也好，不解决目前的物價問題，不能獲致任何發展。物價問題的解决，是戰時經濟的最大要求，除此以外，就沒有戰時經濟的建設。我們希望國府當局重下决心，以解决物價間題。（翼：節譯大陸新報）</p>

<h3>特稿　美國增產困難</h3>
<p>英美正在拼命增產飛機。所以其所需原料的輕金屬部門的增產，顯然也在計劃之中。而號構反軸心國兵器廠的美國的生產力，更値得注目。大東亞戰爭勃發以來，正確的數字，當然極守秘密，據在關係方面所得話情報研究起來，其大概情形，可推定如次：</p>
<p>鋁工業　先從結論來說，鋁年產稱有百萬公噸，鎂計劃年產三十二萬公噸。美國的輕金屬生產，在行政指導方面，企業整備及按術硏究等，已粗具規模，但在以下諸點，因受很大的限制，不能大量增產。</p>
<p>（甲）輕金局生產，需要極大的電力，例如每年要生產鋁一萬公噸，必須有三萬至三萬五千的發電所，無論美國的電力，物資如何鹽富，發電所的問題不是節單地可以解决的。（乙）美國從南美的圭亞那輸入精鋁，而受德國潛艦的威脅。（丙）勞力的不足，（丁）企業家唯利是圖，與政府戰時企業計劃相距太遠。（戊）以鋼為中心的各種建設資材之不足，（己）鐵道運輸力的不够。</p>
<p>先就鋁看，自從中國事變以來，美國料到日美戰的不可避免，故努力擴充生產。其生產世在一九三九年為一四八·三六七公噸，一九四〇年激增至一八七·一三六公噸，次於德國的二四八·〇〇〇公噸而為第二位，佔全世界生產額的百分之二十餘。</p>
<p>這企業是由投資額約十億兀的美國鋁業公司獨占經營，太平洋風雲吿急，不能不實施劃時期的增產時，美國政府　到這獨占經營形態的不安，於一九四一年同時將飛機，鎂，鋁决　為國有民營主義。除鋁本身的擴充計劃之外，他如增設蘭諾土金屬公司，及其他數項擴充計劃，亦均在實施中。受政府資金的工廠稱有四十餘家。</p>
<p>現在正傾全力以完成年產能力六十萬至七十萬公噸的目標。加上和美國成為一體的加拿大正在向年產二十五萬噸的目標擴充中，兩者合計起來，可以有年產百萬噸之說。</p>
<p>鎂工業　鎂工業規模甚小，需要亦少，由道烏公司獨占的供給製造。一九三九年為四。八〇〇公噸，十五年漸增至五·八〇〇公噸，大東亞戰爭勃發，更刺激大量增產，一九四一年六月，建立了把道烏公司一家的生產力從三·〇〇〇公噸增加到一八〇·〇〇〇公噸為目標的第一次計劃，和鋁一樣取國有民營主義，排除道烏公司的獨占。</p>
<p>第一次計劃（甲）亨利，凱柴的多特加利福尼亞造船所（年產能力一〇·九〇〇公噸），（乙）由道馬公司的本身及政府資金擴充，這巳到了相當程度（能力五七·一〇〇公噸）（丙）倍雪克鎂公司這預料極有希望（能力五〇·八〇〇公噸）（丁）其他如達亞蒙·阿爾卡利公司（能力一六·〇○○公噸）瑪希遜，阿爾卡利公司（能力一六·〇〇〇噸），際　業公司（能力一一·〇〇〇公噸）等，這幾家從生產費之點看來是沒有希望的。</p>
<p>根據上面擴充計劃，去年度的生產能大傳說為四萬公噸，在同年六月，其確實能力大約爲二四·〇〇〇公噸。</p>
<p>第二計劃　去年六月美國政府定下了到本年末年產能力達三二三·七〇〇公噸的目標，而開始空中摟閣的建設，本年度的實際生產量據估計七萬公噸，大約是近於正確的數目。（翔：譯自十二月二十五日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<h3>幾樣不用糖和油的小菜</h3>
<p>— 程起鵬</p>
<p>糖和油乃是燒菜的必需品·可是糖的配給是不够消費，油，那更不必說起了。不用糖和油的小菜很多，下面略舉幾樣以供參考。</p>
<p>菠菜湯　這是人人所知曉的「紅嘴綠鸚鵡」燒湯；等到鍋中水已沸的時候，即將菠菜放下，約模三四分鐘後。即可取食（最好時間不要燒得過長），非但味美麵口，而且顏色更鮮艷悅目。若要考究一些的話，不妨加一些開陽和豬油，那是更鮮美順口了。</p>
<p>蒸蛋　幾元錢買一隻蛋，放少許冷水，在燒飯的時候蒸在上面，飯燒好，蛋也熟了。一碗蛋可吃一頓飯；可稱一聲「經這　」尤其是小孩子，沒有一個不喜歡食的。</p>
<p>雪菜發芽豆　買半元錢雪菜（俗名雪里紅），三元錢發芽豆，在飯後用微火煨，漲開後，足有一大碗，晚上是最好的和粥菜。</p>
<p>抄山薯　將山薯（即馬鈴署）切成小塊；放極少許水，等到穌的當兒，就加一些鹽和醬油。這樣，旣可當點心，又能作小菜，眞是二棲的物品。</p>
<p>醬蘿　　把蘿蔔切成一寸見方，二分厚，用豆板醬和甜密醬拌和，大約經過十小時後就可以吃，非常簡單便利。在冬天多吃些生蘿蔔，保證你在明年春天不會生任何種喉嚨病。</p>
<p>蒸黃魚　六七元錢買一條黃魚，放在隔水蒸，將熟時放一些糟，或者沾醋吃。讀者，你可知道是怎樣的味兒？啊！價和「蟹肉」無異。</p>

<h3>寫在棉布發售之前</h3>
<p>— 仁虎</p>
<p>衣貧住行，人生四要，而衣尤推棉布爲首。除了極少數的特殊人物外，無疑的，是每一個市民生活的必需品。尤其在這個隆冬的季節裏，新的舊舊的破被的巳至不能再補的今天，市民所寄望於棉布配給制度的實施，是何等的迫切與期待着！</p>
<p>讀商統會第二十一號通吿，自本年一月一日起將各紗布零售商號准予保留平均一個月之零售數量，發售其半。發售時每一市民限購棉布一丈五尺，並由各商號將市民證號次，姓名記入帳冊，以示限制。渴望已久的棉布配給問題，似乎得到了一個臨時的補救辦法。但不知道這次發售的數量，是否足敷全市每一個具有市民證資格的市民的分配；不然的話，則以往軋米，軋油，軋煤球……等等可怕的景象，恐將重現於棉布店之前，以致老弱，婦孺和為了生活而終日奔渡，日不暇給的薪水者。終於得不到一尺一寸。</p>
<p>其次我們對於無市民證的七歲以卜的兒童，得不到棉布的購買資格，而覺得未妥。兒童是國民的一份子、也就是國家未來的主人翁，正需要收們去培植。　育，為國家保養新的原力。他們也同樣地有着生的權利，法的保障，棉布的　買當然也不能例外，他們與成人也同樣地需要生的條件——衣。所不同的，祇是最的多小而已。</p>
<p>筆者對於此次發售辦法，就管見听又，略述於後，以供有關當局的參考</p>
<p>棉布，也當以計口爲原則，如米·麵粉·油·糖·肥皂·火柴之類然，倘因手續上未及齊務，則不妨借用第五十中期買米證作爲棉布的購買證，憑票發售，其發售的辦法，約可分為下列三級：</p>
<p>（甲）十六歲以上的成年人</p>
<p>成年人的消費量，姑就假定為每人限購一丈五尺，憑票及與本人相符之市民證發售。</p>
<p>（乙）七歲至十六歲的兒意</p>
<p>十六歲以下有市民證的兒童，姑就假定每人限購一丈二尺，憑票及與木人相符之市民證發售。</p>
<p>（丙）七歲以下的幼童</p>
<p>七歲之下以至甚在襁褓中的幼童，得憑票發售，其購買量不妨假定為每人八尺。</p>
<p>由於發售之貨均係各商號保留零售者，四散各處，數量不一，劃分為難，較之其他物品派給者稍有不同，故</p>
<p>1成立公賣處　當局得指定若干較大的棉布商號作為公賣處，將小商店的貨物，歸併於此，核其數量，按日發賣。</p>

<h3>上海特別市市　民防空本部　陳兼部長宣言</h3>
<p>自大東並戰爭勃發以來，兩載於茲矣。主力交綏，現猶賡續未已，戰况益顯其慘澹劇烈之　。際斯時局嚴重之時，盟邦日本後方之一萬萬國民，無一不團結一致，以滿腔之信念與赤誠，向前邁進，力圖奠定，加强其决戰之攻勢，而培養充實其作戰之力量。其在前綫方面，北自朔風凜冽之阿留申羣島北境，南至點熱如焚之西南太平洋海域如所羅門羣島吉爾貝特羣島以及緬甸與南洋一帶，忠勇之盟軍戰士，均能發揚威武，以戰無一不勝攻無不克之經略，確保其愈戰態强之攻勢，與敵周旋。敵人雖一再大舉反攻，而歷次在布根維爾羣島，吉爾具特軍島各役之海上主力戰，吾盟邦不特粉碎敵人之企圖，反予敵艦隊以重創，此種戰果，吾人誠不勝其欽佩者。</p>
<p>此次大戰新東東亞各民旅之永遠解放爲目標，亦即為謀大東亞共榮圈內各民族之獨立自存而戰，故集東亞十萬萬民族之力量以戰。中國自去年一月九日與英美兩國宣戰後，在此戰爭中已負起其重大之使命。凡吾國民，不論其為官史或人民，不論其為商學界與經濟界，或－般民衆，均應一致奮起，共同前進。</p>
<p>敵國英美，以今年為總反攻年，徒恃其豐實生產力，於西南太平洋一帶，疊次反攻，但不特於事無濟，反受莫大之損失。美國擬以其駐華空軍空襲長江一帶各重要都市，並　　　重要軍事基地，擾亂和平地區，對於此種困獸猶鬬之企圖，吾人亟應早事準備，以備萬一。至有謂敵人之空製上海，恐不能成為事實，縱即來襲，亦不過以一部份地域爲限。此種樂觀之推測，適足　入敵人自引爲得意之宣傳策略，一旦有事，必致舉止失措，受害無窮。吾人須知英美以總反攻效力低微，對於我經濟中心之上海，作盲目之擾亂，亦爲意中之事。屆時無論是否為軍事設施，或均受其波及，無論是否為無辜民衆，或均將受其犧牲，語曰：「安不忘危」。又曰：「有備無患」。故吾人應急奮起，以策萬全。</p>
<p>於此種情形，可知成立一完全市民防空準備，實為目前上海市民所急需。木部長對於確立民衆防空體制，亦認為事屬必要，早絰籌慮及之。爰於第一區公署內設立上海特別市市民防空本部，俾研究萬一發生空　時，如何計劃萬全途徑。當危險臨頭之際，如何準備毫無遣漏之措施。然若非上海全體市民與市民防空本部密切連絡，積極合作，則不能期望其能構成一完全之防空壁壘，以保衛上海。</p>
<p>一旦上海遭受敵人之空襲轟炸，本部為使本市市民之生命財產所受之損害減至最低限度起見，當能給民衆以適當之指示，故切望全體市民，能深體此旨，切實遵守當局所指示而行動，俾各人之生命財產，均有相當之保障，而本市治安亦可　固，本部長有厚　焉。</p>

        <h1>1944.01.09</h1>
<h3>The Second Year of China's Participation in the War</h3>
<p>The Republic of China has participated in the Greater East Asia War for a full year. In the past year, the Greater East Asia region has continued to defeat the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States, and it has been a period of advancement in the construction of a new Greater East Asia order. As for China's participation in the war, to be frank, it has only been a period of training for participation. We have already discussed the nature of the Greater East Asia War and the significance of China's participation in the war for liberation and survival yesterday. Now that China has gone through a year of training for participation in the Greater East Asia War, it must enter a period of practice from the second year onwards. The tasks of practice can be divided into the following three points:</p>
<p>First, the task of working with allied nations to strive for victory. The question now is how to assist our ally Japan in quickly defeating Britain and the United States and completing the war. Specifically, it is how to unite the whole country, contribute material and human resources, and work with allied nations to achieve the war's objectives as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Second, the task of realizing the Greater East Asia Declaration. This is also a common task for all countries in Greater East Asia. After a year of participation training, China must now take on more responsibility. The five major principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration are the hope that the nations of East Asia have been seeking for centuries, and they are also the concrete expression of the objectives of the Greater East Asia War. However, to put the Greater East Asia Declaration into practice, it is first necessary to eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States. Therefore, completing the victory of the Greater East Asia War is a prerequisite for all countries.</p>
<p>Third, the task of building a unified new China. At a time when the decisive battle situation is becoming increasingly serious, China must have the awareness and courage to take on this task alone. The Chongqing regime is being used by Britain and the United States to continue to drag out the war, weaken China's national strength, and undermine national unity and construction. The Nanjing National Government must strive to improve politics and improve the people's livelihood. In the peaceful areas, this should be the foundation for strengthening its political position, so that the people under the rule of the Chongqing Communists will unanimously lean towards it. Then the Chongqing Communists will have the name of political power but not the reality of popular support. Even if they want to drag out the war, they will not be able to, and then the unification and construction of the country will be achieved naturally.</p>
<p>The current tasks of China are as described above. To accomplish these three major tasks, the most important prerequisite is that the Nanjing National Government must be a strong and effective government supported by the people. Otherwise, there will always be a considerable distance between tasks and practice, and the effectiveness of the practice will inevitably be questionable.</p>
<p>However, in fact, the Nanjing National Government, which is shouldering the above three major tasks, has not yet fully demonstrated its strength, because: First, it has not yet completed the wartime political system. On this point, the efforts of the National Government in the past year cannot be ignored, but the actual political effectiveness has not yet been brought into play. The reason is that the wartime popular opinion organs have not yet been established, so it is not easy to communicate the cooperation between officials and the people. Second, it has not yet completed the wartime economic system. In this respect, in the past year, considerable institutions have been announced to be established, and wartime economic policy outlines have been announced, but the actual results have not yet been sufficient to show the soundness of the wartime economic system. For example, the endless rise in prices, which makes people's lives increasingly difficult, can already be seen. Third, it has not yet completed the wartime cultural and wartime education systems. Although there are wartime cultural policy outlines in the cultural field, the actual facilities are far away. As for the wartime education system, there has not yet been a concrete establishment, let alone implementation.</p>
<p>The second year of participation in the war has begun again. This year, China's participation in the war should begin a period of practice. On this point, China's journalistic circles must take on greater responsibility, emphasizing and promoting that participation in the war will completely lose its meaning unless it is put into practice, urging the government and the people to rise up together and cooperate with our ally Japan to strive for victory in the war. Finally, we must repeatedly point out that it is not enough to have awareness of the Greater East Asia War, we must have firm belief. It is not enough to have belief, we must have practical action and practice all the tasks of the war.</p>
<h3>The National Government will hold a memorial ceremony today for the first anniversary of its participation in the war. Chairman Wang elucidates the key points of this year's policy implementation.</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The National Government will hold a memorial ceremony for the first anniversary of its participation in the war in the auditorium at 10:00 a.m. today (the 9th). It will be presided over by Chu Minyi, a member of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Today, the 9th, is the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. In order to show their joint commemoration, China, Japan, and Manchukuo have decided to hold a joint broadcast from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. tonight, with the participation of our Chinese President Wang, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, and Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang. At that time, it will be broadcast nationwide by the Central Broadcasting Station.</p>
<p>Nanjing Central News Agency, 8th The 9th is the first anniversary of our country's participation in the war. Special correspondents from domestic and foreign reporters respectfully asked the Chairman the following questions, and he answered them one by one. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Question: What will be the key points of policy implementation in the second year of the war?</p>
<p>Answer: In my New Year's Day speech, I have already pointed out that the focus of this year's work should be to make further efforts in the three aspects of rectifying thought, ensuring security, and increasing production, based on the consistent policy. These three aspects of work are interrelated and cannot be neglected. If we look at the order of importance and urgency, then in the past year, the effort spent on the first two points was actually greater than the effort spent on the latter point. This year, the production increase movement should be the most important point.</p>
<p>Question: How about the penetration of political power into the local areas and the policy implementation of increasing production?</p>
<p>Answer: The current policy implementation of increasing production takes the maintenance of the righteous war and the support of the people as the two major goals. Supporting the war must support the people, and supporting the people is supporting the war. If we want to achieve both supporting the people and supporting the war at the same time, then we must not only maintain a strong productive capacity to engage in production, but also develop all productive forces to engage in increasing production. To put it briefly: The first is the improvement and expansion of arable land. The second is the improvement of agricultural technology and the popularization of agricultural knowledge. The third is the organization and training of rural youth and the backbone farmers. Furthermore, we should study the transformation of rural society. The fourth is the revival of light industries that are most closely related to food and clothing, such as the textile industry and the flour industry. The competent departments are currently reviewing specific plans, which will be implemented immediately. As for the penetration of political power into the local areas, this year, the movement to increase production and maintain security will penetrate from the cities to the rural areas, which goes without saying. There are two things that should be emphasized here: one is in the horizontal aspect, to break the deformed changes in regional concepts. The other is in the vertical aspect, to eliminate the various barriers in the middle class, and to strive to follow the last instructions of the National Father to complete local autonomy, with strengthening the central guiding force as the warp and enriching the people's autonomy as the weft, so that the government's intentions can be popularized to the people one by one, and the people's opinions can also be conveyed to the government one by one.</p>
<p>Question: How will the Kuomintang strengthen its relationship with the party and the government?</p>
<p>Answer: The significance of strengthening the Kuomintang lies in enriching the foundation, strengthening activities, and enabling party members to penetrate into the masses, adhere to the party's doctrine and national policies, and do the work of promoting and guiding, and enrich the party's foundation among the masses. That is, to enrich the foundation of the government, and to correct the malpractices of the party turning into a yamen and the opposition between the party and the government before the incident, so that the work of the party affairs and political work can be promoted in a unified manner. The party's activities should assist the development of politics, so that the government and the masses can become one and jointly shoulder the mission of completing the war, reviving China, and protecting Asia.</p>
<p>Question: Regarding the concrete practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration, please indicate the key points.</p>
<p>Answer: The Greater East Asia Declaration is a crystallization of the self-preservation, self-defense, mutual reliance, and mutual support of the East Asian nations produced in the progress of the Greater East Asia War. It is the driving force for gathering the East Asian nations and completing the war, and it is the guiding principle for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The final completion of the Greater East Asia War depends on the practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration. The concrete practice of the Greater East Asia Declaration depends on the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The most important purpose of today's affairs is to win the decisive battle, and the most important thing is sincere unity. Therefore, how to divide labor and cooperate, increase the overall strength, how to eliminate traitors and consolidate the camp, and how to crush the last struggle of the remaining forces of Britain and the United States are the obligations that the signatory countries of the Greater East Asia Declaration should fulfill, and they are also the rights and responsibilities that the countries and nations of East Asia should have for themselves and for East Asia.</p>
<p>Ambassador Tani gives a special speech</p>
<p>Nanjing Central News Agency, 8th On the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, Ambassador Tani to China issued the following statement:</p>
<p>Since the National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States and issued a declaration to fully cooperate with our country in military, political, and economic affairs in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, a year has passed. Today, on this profoundly meaningful anniversary, looking back on the various trends in Greater East Asia over the past year and observing the achievements of Greater East Asia construction today, which are being realized step by step, I cannot help but feel emotional. Recalling that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government issued a declaration, expressing its determination to say that the National Government would take the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, being firm and unyielding, to face this difficult situation in order to realize the common goal of building a new order in East Asia. It clarified that China would share joys and sorrows with Japan in a wartime system, providing strong rear support for the Japanese army. On the other hand, it would also strive to strengthen political power, cultivate national strength, and prepare to stand on the same front with Japan one day to defeat Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to liberate East Asia from the many years of aggression and domination by Britain and the United States, restore the original status of the East Asian nations, and establish equal and mutually beneficial international relations. This war is not limited to Japan, but is a common war for all the nations of Greater East Asia. Therefore, it is the hope of the East Asian nations to protect East Asia with strength within the possible scope. On the side of the National Government, in view of the fact that Britain and the United States have not reflected at all and are still trying to dominate East Asia, and the British and American air forces are also appearing and disturbing in our country's territory, we must cooperate with strength to complete the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, on January 9th last year, we declared war on Britain and the United States. As Chairman Wang proclaimed in the declaration of participation in the war, China should do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the remnants of British and American tyranny, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia, and to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. Therefore, China's participation in the war is the result of the awakening of the Chinese people, who want to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in the past century, forever get rid of the status of a semi-colony, and are determined to cooperate with Japan to complete this Greater East Asia liberation war and strive to build a co-prosperity sphere. I believe that by practicing Sun Yat-sen's will, the Greater East Asia War will drive the forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia among all wars, and the construction of Greater East Asia is gradually being realized.</p>
<p>At present, China and Japan have established permanent friendly and cooperative relations based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit due to the conclusion of the alliance treaty. On the other hand, the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has been issued, becoming the common ideal of the nations of Greater East Asia. The dawn of the regeneration of Asia has arrived, which is truly worth celebrating together. However, Britain and the United States still maintain the concept of maintaining the status quo and aim to re-dominate East Asia. They want to eradicate the self-awareness and unity of the East Asian nations in the bud. Therefore, under anxiety, they are trying their best to counterattack. The war situation is still extremely fierce, and it has reached a decisive stage to determine the permanent destiny of the East Asian nations. In order to defeat the enemy's self-righteous sense of superiority and make them realize that "the world is not the world of Britain and the United States," we should know that we should do our best to destroy the enemy's ambitions. We also hope that China will grasp this situation at this time, and strive to complete the holy war with the belief of victory.</p>
<p>North China will cooperate to complete the war.</p>
<p>Beiping, 8th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, issued a statement on the 9th, the anniversary of our country's participation in the war. The general idea is that since our participation in the war, we have gathered the overall strength of the country based on the spirit of sharing life and death, and fought side by side with our ally Japan in order to achieve the final victory. The North China Political Affairs Commission will make its greatest efforts to reform political institutions, strengthen the decisive battle system, and strengthen the work of suppressing the Communists to ensure security. At the same time, it has expanded the production base, strived to increase the collection of materials, and vigorously developed resources, all of which have achieved remarkable results. It will also promote all work related to enhancing combat power, such as rectifying thought, enhancing the belief of victory, stimulating the consciousness of the decisive battle, and promoting the implementation of new construction work, all of which are important. North China has made effective efforts in the year since its participation in the war to cooperate with our ally Japan to complete the war. The Greater East Asia War today has entered a decisive stage, and the Chinese people deeply believe that only by completing the Greater East Asia War can we complete China's independence. I sincerely hope that our people will continue to work hard, vigorously implement the New National Movement, and renew their lives with the goal of increasing production and suppressing the Communists, and work together to complete the tasks that our country should shoulder.</p>

<h3>Provisional Government of India Moves to Burma, Bose Issues Statement Urging Indians to Rise Up and Strive for the Independence of Their Motherland</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) The Provisional Government of Free India moved from Shonan to Burma on the 7th. Indian Chairman Bose broadcast to his compatriots in his homeland from the broadcasting station here in the afternoon, explaining that the Provisional Government had moved to Burma, awakening the Indians to quickly rise up and fight together to strive for the independence of their motherland.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) Bose arrived here by plane on the morning of the 7th with Madame Minister Lakshmi, Secretary Sahai, and other important officials. Those who welcomed him included representatives of the Burmese National Government, Japanese Ambassador to Burma Sawada, representatives of Indian overseas Chinese, and officers and soldiers of the Indian National Army stationed in Burma. After Bose exchanged greetings with the welcoming staff, he inspected the National Army and then took a car to the official residence of the Burmese National Government Representative to pay a visit to Mr. Ba Mo. He also visited the highest commander of the Japanese Army to express his gratitude separately. Later, he went to the Provisional Office, issued a statement announcing that the Indian Provisional Government had moved to Burma, and the Indian independence movement had entered the final stage of practice. Then, he broadcast to the Indian people from the radio station here, informing them that the Provisional Government had moved to Burma. Later, he met with a group of reporters, issued a statement explaining his determination, saying that he was determined to destroy the forces of Britain and the United States before stopping.</p>
<p>Rangoon Central News Agency, 8th Jiangte Bose said that the Indian independence movement has now completed its final preparations. He met with Japanese and Burmese reporters in the afternoon of the 7th and issued a statement. The general idea is: After the Provisional Government moves to Burma, needless to say, I, along with the Indians who are advancing with me, am confident that we are ready to start attacking Delhi. The purpose of the movements in India is to seek the independence of the motherland. Regarding the methods, recently, especially young people, have all recognized that independence cannot be obtained without fighting with weapons. Comrades who struggle without weapons in the country are now responding to comrades who engage in armed activities abroad to fight together. According to reliable information I have obtained, the Indian army in India intends to respond to the National Army led by me as soon as our army begins to act. The method of struggle that we should adopt in the future is armed resistance. I am now unusually confident, because we have strength. The people in India and the Indian soldiers in the British Indian Army have gone beyond our common action, and when we need foreign aid, we still have the assistance of Japan and other allied nations.</p>
<p>Inspecting the Andaman Islands</p>
<p>Andaman, 8th (Central News Agency) Bose went to the Andaman Islands on the 29th of last month to inspect and give instructions to the 18,000 Indians on the island, awakening the Indian people to rise up together and destroy Britain and the United States for the independence of India. Mr. Bose and his entourage then visited the highest commander of the Japanese army in Blair, and then went to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to inquire about the situation on the island, and met with local dignitaries. He also went to Ross Island, and spent the night at the former chief official residence on the island. The next day at 11:00, he went to Blair to participate in an unprecedentedly enthusiastic mass meeting in Andaman. Bose personally carried the national flag while the crowd sang the Indian national anthem, and immediately gave a speech on the spot, the general idea being that the residents of Andaman, who were suppressed by Britain, have now been liberated by Japan, and will be incorporated into the country of India itself. There are now only two paths for Indians to follow: one is to bleed and attack Delhi, and the other is to die in battle on the way. When the people heard this, they were all excited and shouted long live Chairman Bose, long live Indian independence. The meeting adjourned in this enthusiastic atmosphere. Mr. Bose and his entourage inspected various facilities on the island and witnessed the huge prison where the British used to imprison Indian independence fighters, and were filled with emotion. He stayed in Ross Island that night and left Andaman Island on the morning of the 31st.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Japanese military authorities</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Central News Agency) The highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma recently stated regarding the Provisional Government of Free India's move to Burma: We are extremely welcome that the Provisional Government of Free India and the Indian National Army have arrived in Burma at the same time. When Chairman Bose declared the establishment of the Provisional Government in Shonan on October 21st of last year, Indian overseas Chinese in Greater East Asia all responded to his command. The organization of the government became increasingly complete, and the mighty spirit of the Indian National Army was immediately rejuvenated. The posture of attacking the British Indian Army in India has been gradually promoted, and the Indian independence movement has now entered the stage of practice. The great action it has given to the United States and Britain is now unnecessary to repeat. The joy of the Indian people is beyond imagination. Summer and Autumn Zhis are sure to rise up and respond to it, and jointly build a free and independent new country. The Burmese National Representative Pa Mo has already expressed his determination to help India at the Greater East Asia Conference. Today, we welcome the government's move to Burma, which fully demonstrates the determination of the Burmese government and people to fully support the Indian Provisional Government. The purpose of the Provisional Government of Free India is to liberate the motherland, which has been groaning under British oppression for three hundred years. If India is not liberated, then the independence of Burma will be difficult to achieve perfectly. In the future, in addition to thoroughly defeating the enemy's stubborn counterattack, the Japanese army in Burma is also willing to further cooperate with the Indian National Army in its attack on Britain, and to look forward to the early realization of Indian independence.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Air Force Hold Modern Parade His Majesty the Emperor Personally Reviews</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Army parade was held at the Yoyogi Training Ground here on the 8th, with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan present. On this day, all the Japanese troops in Tokyo gathered one after another. The inspection ground was solemn and dignified, and the rows were neat. Chinese military attaché to Japan Lieutenant General Wang Weifan and military attachés from various Axis countries also attended the ceremony. In addition, there were tens of thousands of people standing around to watch. At 1:22 p.m., His Majesty the Emperor of Japan wore a military uniform and wore the Grand Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Gold Kite Medal First Class. Accompanied by the adjutant officers, he arrived at the arena on horseback, and the parade immediately began. First, the infantry units and tank units of the Second and Third Divisions of the Eastern Army were reviewed. Then, the Sixth Division of the Eastern Army, which has student soldiers, the artillery units, the vehicle units, and the mechanized units were reviewed. Finally, the cavalry units and the elite of the Army were reviewed. At 1:40, amid the loud military music, the grand parade began. At this time, corresponding to the parade on the ground, the sky above the ceremony arena was also covered by a large formation of 750 aircraft led by Lieutenant General Matsuoka Katsuzo, including the new medium bomber "Tonryu", the new fighter "Hayate" and "Shoki", and the new reconnaissance aircraft "Ki-46", forming a modern parade in which heaven and earth were integrated. The air defense team marched after the mechanized artillery. After the guard cavalry passed, hundreds of tanks followed, successively speeding by. The grand military parade that shook Greater East Asia came to an end. His Majesty the Emperor of Japan returned to the Imperial Palace at 2:50 p.m.</p>
<h3>The National Government's Declaration of War</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, based on the spirit of the China-Japan Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share the joys and sorrows with our friendly nation Japan. Since then, we have started the New National Movement, engaged in ensuring peace and improving the people's livelihood, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States still continue to use their policy of dividing East Asia for a century, and have become even more intensified, even colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called British and American front, and sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, because their dark power has been gradually defeated by the armies, navies, and air forces of our friendly nation Japan, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. Moreover, they are jealous of the National Government's rule of the territory and have repeatedly bombed Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. It is shameful for the Chongqing elements to willingly serve as envoys of Britain and the United States and become traitors to East Asia. The British and Americans, with their long-standing intentions for East Asia, have done everything possible to sow discord in order to achieve their final desire for annexation, which is especially something that the nations of East Asia should all hate together. The National Government hereby announces that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States, and will do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the remnants of British and American darkness, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always been friendly and have the same mind for the co-prosperity of East Asia. In the future, we should promote it even more in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly countries of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for many years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should respond to each other in order to make a contribution to the just new order of the world as a whole. All of our people should only take this as the only opportunity to realize the National Father's Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of faith, righteousness, peace for the world as a whole are all at stake. With one heart and one mind, exerting strength from beginning to end, to carry out this great mission of this great era!</p>
<p>January 9th, 32nd year of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>First Anniversary of My Participation in the War: Ambassador Cai Delivers Remarks, Uniting to Cut Off the Imperialist Ambitions of Britain and America</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - Ambassador Cai Pei, stationed in Japan, in commemoration of the first anniversary of China's participation in the war on the 9th, delivered remarks on the 8th, the original text of which is recorded as follows: "On this day last year, the National Government of our country resolutely declared war on Britain and America. At the same time, the friendly nation of Japan signed an agreement with our country to return the concession territories under special administration and assist our country in recovering the concessions of various countries in China and abolishing extraterritorial rights. This anniversary is truly the most glorious milestone in Chinese history towards liberation and independence. Looking back over the past year, the friendly nation of Japan has upheld the spirit of righteousness in fulfilling its promises, vigorously assisted our country in self-strengthening, and revised the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty into the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit. This further proves Japan's sincerity towards us, a sentiment shared by all Chinese. It is still remembered that after the National Government declared war last year, it immediately devoted itself to establishing a wartime system, organizing the Supreme National Defense Council to concentrate power for implementation. Special emphasis was placed on training the people, ensuring public security, enhancing production, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. All of these are of paramount importance to the victory of the war. To achieve the complete fulfillment of the Greater East Asia War and the completion of the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, all countries and peoples of East Asia must contribute their total strength to the war. As the friendly nation of Japan is doing today, whether it is manpower or material resources, whatever is needed for the war, they are striving to be the first and contributing as much as possible, sacrificing the individual for the greater good. This spirit is unanimous throughout the country, and what we see daily only strengthens our hope that the people of our country will rise up together, share both joys and sorrows, and work together in the war to achieve final victory. China's ability to guarantee freedom and independence depends on the victory of the Greater East Asia War, which no one can deny. On this, the beginning of the second year of China's participation in the war, what I particularly want to emphasize is the importance of a strong war consciousness. If we take a brief look back at history and carefully study the facts, we will know that it was not Japan that reduced China to a semi-colonial state and made China's fate so tragic, but Britain and America. Who was the initiator of the shameful Opium War in war history? Have the people of our country already forgotten? The United States crossed the ocean and, taking advantage of its victory in the Spanish-American War, annexed the Philippine Islands, which had nothing to do with American national defense. Isn't its intention to use this as a base to invade East Asia? The facts of British and American aggression in East Asia are all there. Therefore, when the allied nation of Japan declared war on Britain and America, one billion people in East Asia were united in hatred against a common enemy.</p>
<h3>New Britain Island: American Troops in Dire Straits, Japanese Forces Engaging in Fierce Interception</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 8th (Central News Agency) - After landing in Gloucester on New Britain Island, American troops are currently attempting to advance on the Japanese positions in Bolgan, but are facing fierce interception from Japanese forces and are in dire straits. According to a report from a special correspondent of the Allied Forces Headquarters in New Guinea, American troops have engaged in extremely fierce battles with Japanese forces. It is reported that the American Navy is sending artillery and tank units to the front lines to reinforce. A spokesman for General MacArthur's headquarters also stated that the American ground offensive operations are extremely slow. The Japanese resistance is fierce and unanimous, not hesitating to sacrifice everything. Today, there may still be people in the country who fail to understand that, on the one hand, they believe that Britain and America have abundant resources and are sufficient to defeat all countries, and on the other hand, they believe that Britain and America will treat us kindly in the future, and for their own sake, they only pray for their victory. If there is such a view, it is even more wrong. The material strength of Britain and America is indeed not weak, but the resources of the entire East Asia are even more boundless, and what is even more fatal to Britain and America is that their manpower is limited, and their war aims are unclear, so the people have no fighting spirit, and they are not like the peoples of East Asia, who are united in their efforts to risk their lives for the sake of survival. Therefore, the course of the Greater East Asia War over the past two years is enough to strengthen our belief in victory. In short, if British and American imperialism is not overthrown, East Asia will have no independence. Today, on the anniversary of our country's participation in the war, all our countrymen must unite as one, devote their total strength to working with the allied nation of Japan to overthrow British and American imperialism, and stifle the resurgence of their political ambitions to invade East Asia.</p>
<h3>German Spokesperson Discusses Western European Defense</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency: A German military spokesperson yesterday described for the first time the strength of the defensive works built by Germany along the coast of Western Europe, saying that if Britain and America invade the European continent, their troops will be slaughtered. Germany has built thousands of fixed defensive positions along the Atlantic coast, the English Channel, and the North Sea coast of Europe, equipped with more than 6,000 artillery pieces of 8.8 cm caliber and long-range heavy artillery. There are more than 3,000 artillery pieces that can penetrate iron armor, and millions of naval mines have been laid in the coastal areas. The total length of the coastal defense line is 2,100 kilometers, and the Norwegian coastal defense line is more than 2,500 kilometers long, where about 1,700 artillery pieces are placed. The European defense steel wall from the Pyrenees to Narvik is now ready, and behind it are deep defensive structures. The plan for German mechanized units to be deployed to various places for combat has also been completed. Allied reconnaissance aircraft may have already spied on the defensive strength of the German army, so their offensive has been delayed until now.</p>
<h3>International Red Cross Appeals for Humane Treatment of Prisoners of War, Demands that Belligerents Abide by Treaties</h3>
<p>Geneva, 8th (Central News Agency) - The International Committee of the Red Cross has sent messages to all belligerent countries, appealing for the humane treatment of prisoners of war, stating: "We have recently requested belligerent countries to abide by various treaties and special declarations, and not to change the legal status of prisoners of war and interned civilians. According to Article 2 of the Geneva Convention, which stipulates the treatment of prisoners of war, no retaliatory measures may be taken against prisoners of war. The Committee now urgently requests all belligerent countries or those who detain prisoners not to adopt any retaliatory behavior. They have either surrendered or never participated in combat, and all should be treated as helpless prisoners. The Committee further stated vigorously that the increasingly brutal tools of war are causing widespread civilians and non-military property, and even irreplaceable objects of cultural value, to suffer collateral damage, which is causing increasing anxiety to the Committee. According to the provisions of international law, threats and damages to non-combatants and property should be avoided. Now that the flames of war are spreading everywhere, this has been disregarded. The Committee's duty lies in this, and it will not shirk its responsibility to intervene when it deems necessary. The current war is causing all valuable things, especially moral behavior, to be in danger of being completely destroyed. This appeal is deeply felt to be essential."</p>
<h3>Severe Strike Wave Among US Shipbuilding Workers</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Washington dispatch, unrest in the American labor community remains extremely deep. Labor strikes are frequent, and one wave has barely subsided before another rises again. On the 6th, a strike broke out at the Cramp Shipbuilding Company in Philadelphia, involving 8,500 shipbuilders belonging to the Maritime and Shipbuilding Workers Union of the American Federation of Industrial Organizations. The situation is quite serious and may be difficult to resolve in the short term.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Underway in the Vitebsk Region</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency military correspondent Captain Sertorius reports that the second phase of the battle for Vitebsk has developed into a fierce battle. On Thursday, enemy forces launched a fierce attack on the Vitebsk-Polotsk railway, aiming to cross the railway and advance southwest to attack the rear of the Vitebsk defenders. This attempt has been thwarted by the German defenders. German forces on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, from Pripyat to Zaporozhye, are fiercely resisting Soviet attacks. The overall situation is roughly as follows: Several days ago, enemy vanguards reached the former Soviet-Polish border, but General Vatutin's right flank has slowed its advance slightly, and the enemy pressure in that area is not particularly intense. The objective of General Vatutin's central army, attacking from Berdichev and Kazatin towards the upper reaches of the Bug River, is to capture Minitsa. Enemy forces with numerical superiority have made some progress, but German reserve forces have been able to stop the enemy's breakthrough. General Vatutin's southern shock force has made contact with General Konev's troops southeast of Belaya Tserkov, so the rear of the German forces in the Kirovograd area is now under threat. North of Kirovograd, the situation has improved slightly after a German counterattack with tanks, but the fierce fighting in the great bend of the Dnieper River has only intensified. The enemy's objective in fighting on the southeastern front will be to encircle the German forces still fighting in the Dnieper pocket, or to force them to withdraw to the lower reaches of the Bug River. At present, the Soviet authorities still seem to have the ability to replenish their battered troops, so the winter offensive has not yet reached its peak. As for when this peak can be reached, it is still impossible to foresee.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - Havas News Agency: Enemy forces continue to attack in mild weather. During the winter battles of 1941-1942, temperatures on the German defense line from Nikopol to Vitebsk often dropped below forty to fifty degrees. The climate on the Eastern Front was the most severe in a century, affecting operations. This year, the real Soviet winter has not yet arrived, which is an abnormal phenomenon. According to frontline news on Friday, in the past twenty-four hours, the heaviest enemy pressure was applied in the area south of Berdichev and southwest of Belaya Tserkov. Soviet forces transferred reinforcements to these two points to continue their advance to the south. At the same time, enemy forces also launched flank attacks near Sergachi and Kirovograd. Fierce fighting is currently underway east of that city. The German side claims that most of the Soviet forces attacking Kirovograd have been stopped. In the fierce fighting, the enemy lost 41 tanks. Fighting is still underway in some areas. German tank units launched a counterattack north of the city and drove back the Soviet forces. There is also a major battle in the Zhitomir region. The enemy's offensive west of Proskurov is not as intense as it was a few days ago, so the situation in that area has not changed significantly. The objective of the Soviet offensive at Vitebsk is to tie down German forces. Fierce fighting is currently underway around the city. According to German news, Soviet activities are concentrated on the German positions northwest of the city, in an attempt to isolate the city. German forces destroyed 49 enemy tanks in that area. According to Soviet prisoners of war, two Soviet infantry divisions, one regiment, and one armored unit were annihilated in the fighting southeast of Vitebsk.</p>
<h3>Turkey Expresses Deep Concern Over Soviet-Polish Issue</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Central News Agency) - Quoting Turkish political sources, the German News Agency claims that Turkey is indirectly quite concerned about the current stage of the Soviet-Polish issue, as this incident can serve as a test of the political relations of the Allied powers, as well as a touchstone for maintaining the rights and interests of small countries and the effectiveness of the Atlantic Charter. Turkey is extremely interested in the recent opinions expressed by Pravda against Willkie. Relevant authorities remain extremely cautious in their remarks regarding their stance, but they all believe that Britain will use the same means as in the case of King Peter II and Tito's partisan government to sacrifice the political interests of a common belligerent and concede to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>Street Battles Between German and American Forces in San Vittore</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - Since the 5th, German forces in the western sector of the southern Italian front have engaged in fierce street battles with the advancing American Fifth Army in San Vittore, six miles south of Cassino. American troops are attacking the city from the northeast and southwest, and German forces are currently resisting fiercely.</p>
<h3>Goebbels' Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech on Friday to senior generals returning from the Eastern Front and stationed in the Berlin area, explaining the relationship between military and political actions in the war, saying that the combination of political methods and military tools can produce boundless energy and lead to final victory.</p>
<p>Weekly Commentary</p>
<h3>On Mozi – Dedicated to Mr. Zhang Yipeng –</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyu</p>
<p>China's feudal familism is not a recent phenomenon. In his essay "Promoting the Worthy," Mozi criticized the politics of the time, saying: "Relatives are appointed, without cause they are made rich and noble, and those with pleasing faces are appointed... Therefore, those who cannot govern a hundred people are placed in positions governing a thousand, and those who cannot govern a thousand are placed in positions governing ten thousand." As a result, politics falls into a state of "hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, and disorder without governance."</p>
<p>Mozi lived in the era of King Jing of Zhou, around 500 BC, but his words seem to be aimed at the Chinese politics of 1944. Now, how many people in a corner of Shanghai are "hungry without food and cold without clothing"? The Pushan Villa collected and buried a total of 31,070 corpses last year. Among them, 18,805 were children's corpses and 12,265 were adults' corpses. That is to say, the monthly average is over 2,589, and the daily average is over 85. On November 19th of last year, Shanghai was suddenly hit by a cold wave, and the temperature dropped sharply. On that day alone, the Pushan Villa collected 76 corpses in the first district. Around Christmas last year, it was extremely cold, so the number of people summoned by God on such a festive day was truly considerable. In Hans Christian Andersen's famous fairy tale "The Little Match Girl," while listening to the Christmas bells, she wanted to strike a match to warm herself because of the biting cold, but unconsciously froze to death on a street corner. In Shanghai, there are countless such "Little Match Girls," but the people of Shanghai are already accustomed to it, so Wang Hairen will not be as surprised as Andersen, and use it as material for a fairy tale. Of course, for the people of Shanghai, it is even less of a sensational and shocking tragic material. Although the general public expresses sympathy for those who freeze to death and starve to death (the two cannot be strictly distinguished, because those who freeze to death are mostly also starving), when it comes to "how to deal with this problem," it is something that a few people are powerless to do. Although there is a common saying, "Everyone eats together," almost all of the "everyone" here are naked and freezing to death, so if "everyone eats together" is implemented, the people of Shanghai will have to spend this harsh winter wearing only a shirt and shivering. Moreover, in such a society, if you plan to thoroughly practice compassion for humanity, you may well be the first to become a customer of Pushan Villa. Therefore, now, even if many people see a group of people about to freeze to death and starve to death on the roadside, they can only say "There's nothing I can do" in their hearts and look away.</p>
<p>Let's take another look at how many people in this society are "toiling without rest and in disorder without governance."</p>
<p>At the end of last year, Mr. Zhang Yipeng told me: "Recently, the household rice ration in Shanghai is only one liter per person, but one liter per person is by no means enough to maintain life, so in desperation, people have to resort to 'black market' rice. If there were no 'black market' rice in Shanghai, the number of starving people in Shanghai would reach an alarming figure!" This statement is indeed worth considering. Indeed, if the source of rice outside of Shanghai's "household rice" were cut off, I am afraid that Shanghai would have experienced a "rice panic" long ago. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel sympathy for those who toil under the stars and moon, like a long line dragging a Volga riverboat. Carrying rice, they stagger into Shanghai. They cannot even take the tram (taking the tram requires paying the ticket seller a special facilitation fee in addition to the fare). They are sometimes beaten by the police, or chased away in a panic, abandoning their rice and fleeing. These can be considered people who "toil without rest." However, from a legal point of view, they are disruptors of the controlled economy, and of course they must be suppressed. If they are not suppressed, the rice purchasing work in various places will be greatly affected. Then again, if the rice ration situation in Shanghai continues as it is, if it is not improved, but private rice imports are strictly prohibited, then Shanghai will inevitably experience a "rice panic" immediately. Therefore, they are truly people who are "in disorder without governance."</p>
<p>Speaking of which, recently in Shanghai, the phenomenon of "disorder without governance" is almost universal. Let's take a look at the "Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Yearbook" in my hand, published in 1942. The index of living expenses for salaried workers in Shanghai, with the average purchasing power of one yuan in 1936 tentatively set at 100, then the purchasing power in November 1942 became 5.41; in other words, people who had a monthly salary of 100 yuan in 1936, assuming that they have never had a raise during this period, then their salary in November 1942 is only equal to 5 yuan and 40 cents. After November 1942, because the government prohibited the publication of such indexes, I really dare not guess how far it has fallen now. In short, according to our own practical experience of life, we can say that 100 yuan now does not equal one yuan in the past. Assuming that this experience is correct, then the regular income of a minister-level official in the National Government, even adding various allowances and "black horse fees," will not reach 5,000 yuan, so in terms of income alone, it is not even as good as a salary of 50 yuan in the past. And so on, as for the income of middle and lower-level civil servants, although it is not enough to maintain life, they are still alive in the world. Isn't this a strange story of ancient and modern times? For example, in an era when one stone of rice costs 2,500 yuan, and the monthly salary is only 1,000 yuan, then how can one live? There is no need to elaborate, everyone knows that this is not enough. This insufficient part must be filled by some irregular method. This "some method" has become a big problem. I think this is the source of all social evils. For example, originally students could be content with their own duties and not overstep their authority to demonstrate and cause trouble. The government only needs to issue an order, and gambling dens and opium dens can be closed down. However, these places that consume money, even though they are the target of public criticism, still exist. In the final analysis, the reason cannot but be sought in "some method." The patrolmen on the street demand protection money from cigarette shops, the reason ultimately lies in "some method." The lower-level staff of the military-managed telephone company, using the "military" talisman to seek to cancel telephones and extort huge sums of money, the reason also ultimately lies in this "some method." Recently, I have especially often heard of judges who uphold the "dignity of the law" violating the law and making a fool of themselves. Perhaps it is because the part of the judges' monthly salary that has to be filled by "some method" is too large. Honestly speaking, only this "some method" is the economic foundation of the phenomenon of "disorder without governance." In order to fundamentally eradicate such social evils, it is necessary to first destroy their economic causes. For example, suppressing the continuous and rapid decline in the value of money is an urgent task at hand.</p>
<p>What stimulates the economic causes of these social evils and increasingly exploits their ferocity is the shortcomings of modern politics. Eliminating these causes is the best way to stabilize the economy. This point has almost become a commonplace. The biggest defect of modern politics is the feudal familism of "appointing relatives, making the undeserving rich and noble, and appointing those with pleasing faces," as Mozi said, and the politics of favoritism of "placing those who cannot govern a hundred people in positions governing a thousand, and placing those who cannot govern a thousand in positions governing a hundred." This point can simply be said to be an open secret today. The way to treat the symptoms is like what Mozi had long ago proposed: "In ancient times, the sage kings... did not favor fathers and brothers, did not favor the rich and noble, did not change their colors. The worthy were promoted and elevated, made rich and noble, and appointed as officials." Now, fortunately, the Nanjing government has appointed a worthy person as the Minister of Judicial Administration, and this is Mr. Zhang Yipeng. The Minister of Judicial Administration, who is nearly seventy years old and always wears plain cotton robes, walking or taking a third-class tram, can be said to be a rare phenomenon in the Nanjing government. I believe that the existence of a thrifty and self-disciplined Minister of Justice is in itself the best encouragement for current politics. He is just like what Mozi said: "The hall is three feet high, the stairs have three steps, the thatch is not cut, the beams are not scraped, eating earthen pots, using earthen utensils, eating coarse grains, drinking thin soup, wearing hemp clothes in summer, and wearing deer fur in winter (Tai Shi Gong's Preface)." He loves a simple and natural life. It is precisely because Mozi had such a lifestyle that his words, line by line, were filled with infinite sympathy for the common people. Mozi said: "The people have three worries: hunger without food, cold without clothing, and toil without rest." Mr. Zhang must also understand, because of his own life, that the citizens of Shanghai are now suffering from these three worries! For this reason, all the citizens of Shanghai have great expectations for Mr. Zhang's appointment as Minister of Justice. This is because the government has, for the first time, "used the worthy and the capable in governing." At the same time, this is because the citizens of Shanghai are eagerly awaiting that, through Mr. Zhang's efforts, the phenomena of "hunger without food, cold without clothing, toil without rest, and disorder without governance" will disappear from the world.</p>
<p>May I ask you, sir, to answer the expectations of the people of Shanghai with facts. (Translated by Dalu)</p>

<h3>Anniversary of Participation in the War, People's Representative Assembly to be Held at the Grand Theater This Morning</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that in order to celebrate the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war and to arouse the consciousness of the decisive battle, the Shanghai people have jointly organized a Shanghai Special City People's Representative Assembly on the anniversary of the first year of participation in the war at the Grand Theater at ten o'clock today. In order to thoroughly clarify the meaning of participation in the war to all the citizens of the city, the Municipal Propaganda Department, together with the Municipal Headquarters of the Youth League, the Fourth Brigade of the Model Youth League, and the Municipal Party Department, have jointly organized six propaganda teams, which began to carry out propaganda work in all the main streets and entertainment venues at eight o'clock this morning. In order to universally post a large number of slogans, so that all the citizens of the city will know what to strive for, 50 youths have been mobilized to form groups and distribute them to shops for posting, and personnel will be dispatched at any time for inspection.</p>
<h3>Household Rice for the Lunar New Year: Considering an Additional Increase; Rice Control Committee Discusses Material Exchange</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: The Rice Grain Control Committee convened its third plenary Sino-Japanese Committee meeting at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 7th) in the meeting room on the third floor of the committee. Attendees included Chairman Yuan Lvdeng, Vice Chairmen Hiroya Junichi and Chen Guoquan, and Committee members Lin Kanghou, Luo Nezhai, Jiang Kesheng, Wu Huanru, Yan Jiyun, Ji Hua, Dai Ai, and Chen Ziyi (represented by Gu Jiren). Japanese Committee members present were Umezawa Manjiro and Ueda Kenjiro, with advisors Kaiguchi Mamoru, Mikichi Mori, and Yoshikawa Mori also in attendance. Secretary-General Zhou Chunyu and Deputy Secretary-General Yang Shouzhang were also present. Chairman Yuan Lvdeng first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the main topic for discussion was the exchange of goods. Regarding the allocation of rice to impoverished residents in Shanghai, it had been increased to two sheng per person per period starting from the 11th of this month. Towards the end of the lunar year, an additional increase would be considered if possible, so that the allocation of rice for civilian consumption could gradually return to a normal state. Subsequently, the heads of various departments reported on the progress of their work and current status. Finally, several important issues were resolved, such as the exchange of goods and restrictions on the free transport of rice flour products (like New Year cakes). The meeting concluded at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Electricity Supply Increase Decided For Factories Related to People's Livelihood</h3>
<p>Due to the recent coal shortage and in order to conserve resources, the authorities began reducing electricity supply last month. This has led to the suspension of production in some factories in the city, significantly affecting the lives of ordinary people. Consequently, several manufacturers have repeatedly appealed to the authorities, requesting a revision of the electricity conservation standards. It has now been learned that the municipal government considers it necessary to re-evaluate these requests, especially for factories related to people's livelihood. Reducing electricity to these factories would be detrimental to both the nation and society. Therefore, the government has repeatedly contacted the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company to discuss reasonable ways to revise the electricity reduction measures. Currently, the municipal government and the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company have decided to increase the electricity allocation to factories related to people's livelihood. Detailed measures are expected to be finalized and announced in mid-month.</p>
<h3>Reservation of Cotton Cloth Changed, Sales Method; National Commercial Control Association</h3>
<p>The National Commercial Control Association previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which was approved, to allow cotton cloth retailers in the city to sell half of their reserved cotton cloth in the market to meet the public's needs for cloth during the winter season. The Commercial Control Association had already made a public announcement regarding this matter. Now, the association has reported, based on reports from the industry association, that half of the reserved amount is insufficient to meet the purchasing needs of the public. As such, the association has specifically submitted a changed plan to the Executive Yuan, proposing to allocate cotton cloth in advance based on the city's total population, calculating at a rate of 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) per person, and distributing it to retailers for sale. Once approved by the Executive Yuan, the sales date and method will be announced.</p>

<h3>Five Organizations Host Farewell for Mr. Zhang Yipeng's New Appointment, Distinguished Guests Gather, A Moment of Great Splendor</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Mr. Zhang Yipeng, a respected senior figure in China's judicial circles, has been appointed Minister of Judicial Administration and will soon assume office in Nanjing. Five non-governmental organizations in the city, including the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, the Press Association, the Civic Welfare Association, the Thrift Association, and the Chinese National Diplomatic Promotion Association, believe that Mr. Zhang's appointment to the Ministry of Justice is a stroke of luck for China's judicial future. They jointly held a grand tea party at 4:30 PM yesterday (the 8th) at the meeting hall of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association to express their best wishes. Officials from various Sino-Japanese institutions in the city and prominent figures from all walks of life attended enthusiastically, creating a moment of great splendor with a gathering of distinguished guests. Chinese and Japanese officials and prominent figures present included: Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Ding Fubao, Lin Kanghou, Yi Yunqing, Yuan Lvdeng, Tang Shoumin, Zhao Jinzhen, Wang Boyuan, Jin Xiongbai, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Su Sen, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Zibai, Gu Nanxun, Shen Siliang, Lu Feng, Weng Yongqing, Zheng Hongyan, Zheng Xianzhi, Zhou Mengbai, Ren Zhenpeng, etc. From the Japanese side, there were Funatsu Tatsuo, Kajiki Setsu, Hata Akira, Kurimoto Inaji, Yoshida Toyu, Tsutsumi Takashi, and Hidaka Kiyoshi, totaling over 140 people. Chairman Wen Lanting delivered a speech, expressing admiration for Mr. Zhang's appointment to the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Zhang then delivered a reply (see below), followed by speeches from the newly appointed Chairman of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Funatsu Tatsuo, Lin Kanghou, Kurimoto Inaji, Su Sen, and Chen Binhe. After two hours, the tea party concluded.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Response</p>
<p>I have been an ordinary citizen for 23 years, and suddenly, I am transformed into an official. Ordinary citizens always tell the truth, but officials may not always tell the truth. Fortunately, I have not yet taken office and am still an ordinary citizen, so I can speak truthfully with everyone. First, I will explain the reasons for accepting the official position, which are threefold: First, emotional reasons. Although Chairman Wang and I were classmates, we have not seen each other since 1912. Even after returning to Nanjing, I should not visit him, because I am old and have been away from officialdom for a long time. Why bother him with my presence? Last year, Chairman Wang came to Shanghai and invited me for discussions twice, and then Finance Minister Zhou, Mayor Chen, and other friends in Nanjing urged me to accept. If I were to act like "Duan Shimu climbing over the wall to avoid," it would be too unkind. Second, investigative in nature. From what I have heard in Shanghai, there is much dissatisfaction with the Nanjing government's policies. The people are suffering, and I am one of those suffering. But why has this situation arisen? Are the government authorities capable of acting but not acting, or have they already acted but it is impossible to succeed? I want to get a better understanding of the truth and also help the people understand some of the realities. People say, "Go deep into the people," but I believe that if I have already gone deep into the people, I might as well go deep into the government. Third, ideological issues. Comprehensive peace has become the most urgent matter for Greater East Asia today, and for the various strategies for comprehensive peace, whether advocated by our allies or by the Nanjing government, I always feel that they are just scratching the surface. I believe that war, diplomacy, and propaganda are all temporary measures. To start from the root, we should compete in civic virtue. When civic virtue is on the right track, there is no need to seek comprehensive peace; it will naturally "fall into place." As the ancients said, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people will know honor and shame." This is a positive force in politics, and the force that can urge civic virtue onto the right track is the negative force of justice. Based on these three points, although I have not yet taken office and cannot specifically explain the policy guidelines of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, my consistent principle is to select honest and upright personnel, seek sufficient funding, and ensure that all levels of courts and procuratorates handle cases, whether criminal or civil, quickly and justly. Fortunately, the previous minister has already laid a good foundation for these three matters. As long as I add some effort to promote them, I may be able to achieve the goals. My only fear is that I am too old and my spirit is insufficient, which is a practical obstacle that I cannot overcome. Today's conversation with everyone present has been truly pleasant and deeply appreciated.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao's Sixth Scholarship Fund Application Situation Unprecedented</h3>
<p>This Year's Scholarship Fund Is Severely Insufficient, Awaiting Continued Contributions from All Sectors</p>
<p>On the first day of the Greater East Asia War National Common Sense Exhibition organized by this newspaper, application forms for the sixth scholarship fund were distributed. A large number of students came to visit the exhibition and collect the forms. A total of over 9,000 new and returning student application forms were distributed throughout the day, with new student applications accounting for the majority. From 9:00 AM, students applying for the forms arrived in an endless stream. By afternoon, the number of people increased sharply, like a tide, forming a line from the entrance of the Wah Mei Hotel, stretching along Nanjing Road and turning onto Renji Road. By 5:00 PM, over 6,000 new student forms and over 3,000 returning student forms, totaling over 9,000 forms, had been distributed. This phenomenon reflects the widespread impact of the serious state of living, causing numerous students to be at risk of dropping out of school.</p>
<p>Please Continue to Contribute from All Sectors</p>
<p>The large number of students applying yesterday, and the endless stream that followed, indicates that the current amount of our newspaper's funds is insufficient by several times. Seeing the students coming from afar, waiting in the bitter cold for several hours, their fervent hope for continued education and their need for assistance are self-evident. However, the insufficient distribution of scholarships often makes our colleagues uneasy. We believe that people from all walks of life share this sentiment. We hope that people will continue to demonstrate the same spirit as in the past, nurturing talent and generously donating funds to help underprivileged students so that they do not have to drop out of school halfway. The smooth progress of our newspaper's scholarship work depends on the strong support of concerned individuals.</p>
<p>Three Points of Attention for Applying Students</p>
<p>The large number of students applying this time is beyond our expectations. However, there may inevitably be some unnecessary applications. To benefit truly excellent and outstanding students, we specifically state the application requirements below, hoping that applying students will pay attention to them: Applicants' families must be genuinely impoverished. The overall average of academic performance must be above 80 points. Conduct must be rated as "A". We hope that students applying for assistance will first consider whether they meet the above requirements. Otherwise, please do not apply, to avoid wasting your time. Also, students below the fifth grade are generally not eligible to apply. Students in the industrial and commercial groups can inquire about application times.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Gifts to Supplement Scholarships</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Maiyan Zhai sent four types of gifts, requesting that they be sold for charity to benefit scholarships. His letter stated: "I have received four types of gifts from a friend, and I feel uneasy about accepting them. I respectfully send them to your newspaper for a charity sale, and all proceeds, regardless of the amount, will be donated to the scholarship fund to repay my friend's kindness and provide a little warmth for underprivileged students." Furthermore, Xin Ya Pharmacy has responded to the scholarship efforts and has generously donated 10,000 yuan to benefit the underprivileged, which is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: Xin Ya Pharmacy donated 10,000 yuan, Mr. Yixin, Xu Zhongyong, and Mr. Han each donated 500 yuan, Class B of Junior 3 of Guangxia Middle School donated 225 yuan, Mingji donated 200 yuan, Nan Tianfang donated 100 yuan, Pan Wenzuo and Wenzao donated a total of 100 yuan, and Mr. Huang donated 20 yuan. The total amount received in Central Reserve Bank Notes was 12,145 yuan, leaving a balance of 1,553,451 yuan.</p>
<h3>New Press Association Held War Participation Speech Last Night, Minister Zhang of Judicial Administration was the Speaker</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Since the allied nation Japan launched the war to defeat Britain and the United States, the National Government also declared war on January 9 of last year. The dawn of Greater East Asia is now in sight. On the occasion of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, the Shanghai Press Association hosted a "Celebration of the First Anniversary of the National Government's Participation in the War Speech Meeting" at the Majestic Theater on Gordon Road at 7:30 PM last night (the 8th). The newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, was invited to be the main speaker. Members of the presidium included representatives from the Continental New Daily (with Ren Zhenpeng representing Oita), the Chinese Daily (with Jiang Jingzhang representing Xu Liqiu), the Ping Bao (Jin Xiongbai), the New China Daily (with Lu Feng representing Yuan Shu), the New Shen Bao (with Hidaka Kiyoshi representing Moriyama Takashi), the News Daily (with Cao Zhongzhi representing Wu Ziliang), and the General Secretary of the Press Association, Ren Zhenpeng, etc., with a total audience of over 2,000 people, creating an unprecedentedly grand scene. Chairman Jin Xiongbai delivered a speech, stating that on the eve of the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, the members of the Press Association, with great enthusiasm, were holding this war participation speech meeting. The Greater East Asia War has now reached a decisive stage. Since China has already participated in the war, the government and the people should cooperate on how to complete the Greater East Asia War. Tonight, they had specially invited the newly appointed Minister of Judicial Administration to deliver a speech, which would surely provide them with many insights.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang's Speech</p>
<p>Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang was then invited to deliver a speech, briefly stating: Today marks just one year since the National Government's participation in the war. In this one year, we can say that the time has been too short, but also that the time has been too long. After all, it has been over 360 days, and the people have been suffering every day. If we are afraid of suffering and hope that the time of participation in the war will be short, then this will be a loss of our will to fight. Therefore, we should not be afraid of suffering, and we should not be afraid of prolonging the time of participation in the war. Now, the war's front and rear should be unified. If the rear is enjoying itself, then the front's battles will definitely not succeed. Although we do not have a single soldier or clan going to the front, we should supply the war effort with materials from the rear. In this year, we have supplied the war effort with no small amount. However, the materials saved by the people will inevitably decrease day by day. Therefore, in addition to supplying materials, the rear must also produce. Only in this way can we have an inexhaustible source to supply the war effort. I also hope that the government will provide the people with various means of production, so that the government and the people can be mobilized in unison to cooperate in the war and complete the Greater East Asia War. After the speech, the blockbuster film "Raging Seas and Moving Thunder" was screened, ending at 11:00 PM.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>A Speech Presented to Mr. Zhang Yipeng at the Farewell Tea Party Hosted Jointly by Five Organizations</h3>
<p>-- Chen Binhe</p>
<p>My personal feelings are that Mr. Zhang's appointment as Minister of Judicial Administration has three meanings:</p>
<p>First, Mr. Zhang and Chairman Wang are old classmates, "schoolmates and friends." Classmates are the closest friends. A national leader usually lives a secluded life, so he most needs a close friend through whom he can speak frankly and honestly, especially about the sufferings of the people. At the same time, a friend from the people is even more appropriate.</p>
<p>Second, we have always advocated a government of good people and clean politics. Therefore, the National Government's appointment of Mr. Zhang is considered a very clear move. In other words, appointing Mr. Zhang is equivalent to training a division of soldiers, which is no exaggeration. Currently, there are "18 ministries" in the Executive Yuan, and at least half of the ministries should appoint talent from the people. It does not necessarily have to be limited to Shanghai or Jiangsu; as long as they have reputation and talent, people from all regions can be considered without prejudice. Of course, we are not saying that the current ministers are incompetent. However, the hope that politics will become more progressive cannot be achieved by simply rotating a few officials. Therefore, appointing only Mr. Zhang is not enough.</p>
<p>Third, the government's ability to appoint Mr. Zhang shows that the government is selecting talent from the people, which is certainly a very good phenomenon. However, from the perspective of getting closer to the people, the government has only done part of the job. We believe that, to take it a step further, it needs to establish a civil opinion organization with a long-term vision that truly conveys the people's opinions, in order to complete the ideal of democratic politics.</p>
<p>In addition, our expectations for Mr. Zhang are naturally particularly fervent and broad. Here, I would like to put forward two points first:</p>
<p>First, Mr. Zhang's recent remarks have only been limited to the scope of judicial administration. For Mr. Zhang personally, perhaps he is speaking from his own position, but from our perspective as the people, it is not enough. The people's expectations are definitely not limited to this. We believe that Mr. Zhang is in charge of the judiciary, and while the judiciary is certainly important, the entire political situation is especially important. Therefore, he must participate in the entire political situation. To be honest, if the entire political situation cannot be resolved, the judiciary itself will definitely not be resolved either.</p>
<p>Second, Mr. Zhang's spirit of courage in accepting this appointment is admirable. We hope that he will only think about moving forward and not about retreating, and that his benevolence will extend to the people and his name will be forever remembered. Then Mr. Zhang's success will also be the success of the National Government, and the people will naturally be happy to be his backing.</p>

<h3>First Division Soccer League: Friendship Game Between Lianyi and Portuguese Merchants at Yiyuan Today at 10:30 AM</h3>
<p>In the First Division Soccer League, Lianyi will face off against Portuguese Merchants in a friendly match at Yiyuan today at 10:30 AM. The referee is He Chunhui. Lianyi's lineup is new. Forward Li Yichen will still be in the center, commanding the line, with Xu Wenkui on the left wing. It is expected that their strength will be greatly enhanced. The Portuguese Merchants have a tendency towards hemiplegia. Although the right wing is weaker than the left wing, Mashan'er has many tricks. Lianyi will use a rough-and-tumble style to control the enemy to the death. Lianyi's hope of winning is naturally higher. Today's schedule is as follows:</p>

<h3>The Righteous General is Helpless: Police One Defeats Overseas Chinese League</h3>
<p>Yesterday's First Division soccer match was between Police One and the Overseas Chinese League. The game was played at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The Overseas Chinese League had difficulty coordinating, missing many good opportunities. Police One always took the initiative. Labor Stovka was as valiant as ever, overcoming the Overseas Chinese League by five to one. Even the League's generals had no solutions, causing a big surprise. In another match, the Second Division team of Qunren continued their consistent style, losing to Chengyi by six to three. At the beginning of the First Division match, Overseas Chinese League's Kalolier District made a central breakthrough, but Tiffony resolutely stopped him. Police One advanced as a whole. Little Huangmao desperately darted in, and Anpulikauff delivered a head-on blow, which McNitty could not save in time. Before long, Police One's Mai Qidang secretly crossed Chencang again, scoring another goal, making it 2-0. The Overseas Chinese League was discouraged. Police One's Anfali Kofu scored another goal in the chaos. At this time, McNitty was seriously injured and left the field, replaced by Rodi. In the morning, he competed against Police One, scoring three goals. After changing sides, the Overseas Chinese League was even more unable to withstand the attack. Labor Stovka easily scored another goal, and then Roselle touched the ball with his hand, committing a penalty. Salati kicked it in, finally breaking the duck egg, making it 4-1. As a final flourish, Little Huangmao scored again, making the final score 5-1.</p>

<p>In the Morning Friends Cup basketball tournament, Hualian will play against the Shantou team today. Hualian is ambitious and has great aspirations for the championship. The Shantou team has a reputation as the "Central Youth Team." The two sides are evenly matched, and a fierce battle is inevitable. Today's schedule is as follows: Mao Yun - Chenguang (Second Division Friends) 2:00 PM, Tongyi - Nanyang (Second Division Morning) 2:45 PM, Zhongbei - Chenxian (Second Division Morning) 3:30 PM, Qingyan - Shangtong (Second Division Friends) 4:15 PM, Hualian Huang vs. Shantou Team (First Division) 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Economic World Translation and Commentary</p>
<h3>Paying Attention to the Price Problem</h3>
<p>The recent rise in the prices of daily necessities is truly alarming. However, it is incomprehensible that the authorities are standing by idly. This rapid increase in prices has a significant impact on the people's livelihood and causes Chinese private capital to engage in commodity hoarding again, further stagnating industrial production. How high prices hinder the construction of the wartime economy and how they impede the enhancement of combat power need not be repeated. Therefore, this situation absolutely cannot be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the reasons for the price increase include factors related to currency, as well as poor circulation of goods and hoarding activities. It is certainly very difficult to eliminate these reasons under the current political and economic conditions, but it is not impossible. Moreover, the authorities only need to take simple measures and resolutely suppress prices to resolve half of these reasons, depending on the authorities' determination.</p>
<p>The crackdown on hoarding and profiteering activities is also an effective price control measure. Recently, the hoarding and profiteering activities are being carried out by companies and businesses under the so-called control mechanism, and the supervisory agencies are not surprised by it. We hope that the control mechanism itself will automatically exert its supervisory function.</p>
<p>The government's efforts to purchase cotton yarn and cloth once made private capitalists fearful, but now they are reviving and still dreaming of pursuing profits. These tendencies are all incompatible with the construction of China's wartime economy. The goal of China's wartime economic construction is to revitalize production and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, neither production nor people's livelihood can achieve any development without solving the current price problem. Solving the price problem is the biggest requirement of the wartime economy. There is no construction of the wartime economy without it. We hope that the National Government authorities will redouble their determination to solve the price problem. (Yi: Abridged translation of the Continental New Daily)</p>
<h3>Cotton Mill Association Investigates Members' Raw Material Needs, Distributing Forms for Detailed Reporting</h3>
<p>Since the government implemented the yarn and cloth policy, cotton mill operators in the city have been forced to suspend operations due to raw material shortages, threatening the livelihoods of workers. The Cotton Mill Industry Association has repeatedly received calls for help from its members, urging the authorities to allocate raw materials as soon as possible to provide relief. In addition to applying to the relevant authorities on one hand, the association has also distributed two types of forms, the "Current Situation Survey Form" and the "Weaving Group Survey Form," to its members to accurately determine the amount of raw materials needed each month. The association will use these reports as a reference to plan a production allocation plan.</p>
<h3>Widespread Decline in Chinese Stocks; Stocks with Strong Gains Also Decline Rapidly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks universally weakened, mainly due to continued pressure from tight monetary conditions. Only near noon did some bargain hunters begin to become active, but because the prior declines had been significant, the various stocks generally closed down considerably. Only Sanle Industries rose over one yuan, while Jiu'an broke through 40 yuan before quickly retreating. Real estate stocks were among the weakest, with Xinyi returning to 31.75 yuan. Among department store stocks, Yong'an broke the 200 yuan mark, with transactions at 200.50 yuan in the afternoon. Xin Xin and Guohuo each fell about 4 yuan. Textile stocks were the most sluggish, while Xin Yuye and chemical stocks also generally showed weakness. Among cultural stocks, Commerce Press reached a new high, while China Film rebounded quite sharply. Kang Yuan Confectionery fell to the 100 yuan level. Financial stocks saw little selling.

<h3>Special Article: Difficulties in U.S. Production Increase</h3>
<p>Britain and the United States are desperately increasing aircraft production. Therefore, the increased production of light metal sectors for needed raw materials is obviously also in the planning stages. The productive power of the United States, which claims to be a factory for weapons against the Axis powers, is even more noteworthy. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, accurate figures have naturally been kept highly secret. Based on information obtained from relevant sources, the general situation can be estimated as follows:</p>
<p>Aluminum Industry: To begin with the conclusion, the annual production of aluminum is said to be one million metric tons, and the planned annual production of magnesium is 320,000 metric tons. In terms of administrative guidance, enterprise preparation, and technical research, the production of light metals in the United States has taken preliminary shape. However, due to significant limitations in the following aspects, massive production increases are not possible:</p>
<p>(A) Light metal production requires enormous amounts of electricity. For example, to produce 10,000 metric tons of aluminum annually, a power plant with a capacity of 30,000 to 35,000 kilowatts is required. Regardless of the wealth of electricity and resources in the United States, the power plant issue cannot be easily resolved. (B) The United States imports refined aluminum from Guyana in South America, which is threatened by German submarines. (C) Labor shortage. (D) Entrepreneurs are solely focused on profit, which is too far removed from the government's wartime enterprise plan. (E) Shortage of various construction materials centered on steel. (F) Insufficient railway transportation capacity.</p>
<p>First, looking at aluminum, since the China Incident, the United States anticipated the inevitability of a U.S.-Japan war and therefore worked hard to expand production. Its production in 1939 was 148,367 metric tons. In 1940, it surged to 187,136 metric tons, second only to Germany's 248,000 metric tons, accounting for more than 20% of the world's production.</p>
<p>This enterprise is exclusively operated by the Aluminum Company of America, with an investment of approximately one billion yuan. As the situation in the Pacific became critical, and it was necessary to implement a period of production increase, the United States government felt uneasy about this monopolistic operation and simultaneously decided in 1941 to nationalize aircraft, magnesium, and aluminum, allowing private operation. In addition to the expansion plan for aluminum itself, the establishment of Reynolds Metals Company and other expansion plans are also underway. It is said that there are more than 40 factories receiving government funding.</p>
<p>Now, every effort is being made to achieve the goal of completing an annual production capacity of 600,000 to 700,000 metric tons. In addition, Canada, which is integrated with the United States, is expanding towards an annual production target of 250,000 metric tons. Combined, it can be said that the annual production is one million tons.</p>
<p>Magnesium Industry: The magnesium industry is small in scale and requires less. It is supplied and manufactured exclusively by Dow Chemical Company. In 1939, it was 4,800 metric tons. It gradually increased to 5,800 metric tons in 1940. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War further stimulated massive production increases. In June 1941, the first plan was established to increase the production capacity of Dow Chemical Company alone from 3,000 metric tons to 180,000 metric tons. Like aluminum, it adopted a nationalized but privately operated approach to eliminate Dow Chemical Company's monopoly.</p>
<p>First Plan: (A) Henry J. Kaiser's Todd California Shipbuilding Corporation (annual production capacity of 10,900 metric tons). (B) Expanded by Dow Chemical Company itself and government funds, which has reached a considerable level (capacity of 57,100 metric tons). (C) Basic Magnesium Inc., which is expected to be very promising (capacity of 50,800 metric tons). (D) Others such as Diamond Alkali Company (capacity of 16,000 metric tons), Mathieson Alkali Works (capacity of 16,000 metric tons), and Permanente Metals Corporation (capacity of 11,000 metric tons). These companies are not promising in terms of production costs.</p>
<p>According to the above expansion plan, the production capacity of the last year was rumored to be 40,000 metric tons, and the actual capacity in June of the same year was approximately 24,000 metric tons.</p>
<p>Second Plan: In June of last year, the U.S. government set a target of reaching an annual production capacity of 323,700 metric tons by the end of this year and began constructing castles in the air. The actual production volume for this year is estimated to be 70,000 metric tons, which is approximately the correct number.

<h3>Several Dishes Without Sugar and Oil</h3>
<p>— Cheng Qipeng</p>
<p>Sugar and oil are necessities for cooking. However, the sugar ration is not enough for consumption, and oil, needless to say, is even more scarce. There are many dishes that do not require sugar and oil. Here are a few examples for reference.</p>
<p>Spinach Soup: This is the well-known "red-billed green parrot" soup. When the water in the pot has boiled, immediately add the spinach and cook for about three to four minutes. It can then be eaten (it is best not to cook it for too long). It is not only delicious, but the color is also brighter and more pleasing to the eye. If you want to be more particular, you can add some dried shrimp and lard, which will make it even more delicious and smooth.</p>
<p>Steamed Egg: Buy an egg for a few yuan, add a little cold water, and steam it on top of the rice while cooking. When the rice is cooked, the egg is also cooked. One bowl of egg can be eaten for one meal. It can be called "economical," especially for children, none of whom dislike eating it.</p>
<p>Pickled Mustard Sprouts with Sprouted Beans: Buy half a yuan of pickled mustard greens (commonly known as "snow vegetables") and three yuan of sprouted beans, and simmer them over low heat after a meal. After they swell, there will be a large bowl, which is the best vegetable to eat with congee at night.</p>
<p>Stir-fried Sweet Potatoes: Cut the sweet potatoes (i.e., potatoes) into small pieces. Add a very small amount of water, and when they are tender, add some salt and soy sauce. In this way, they can be used as snacks and side dishes. They are truly amphibious items.</p>
<p>Soybean Paste Radish: Cut the radish into one-inch squares, two-tenths of an inch thick, mix with broad bean paste and sweet dense sauce, and it can be eaten after about ten hours. It is very simple and convenient. Eating more raw radishes in winter will guarantee that you will not get any throat diseases next spring.</p>
<p>Steamed Yellow Croaker: Buy a yellow croaker for six or seven yuan, and steam it over water. When it is almost cooked, add some lees or dip it in vinegar. Readers, do you know what it tastes like? Ah! It is no different in value from "crab meat."</p>
<h3>One Li for Education</h3>
<p>— (Wang Baishi)</p>
<p>Silver and cash: The government deducts income tax on deposits, which is as high as 5%. The government pays 4%, and 1% is paid for their labor. In the past, the silver and cash industry should have considered the interests of its customers and preferred to forgo this 1% to benefit customers, which shows their spirit of service and is commendable. Only recently have they accepted this remuneration, which is truly humble and commendable. The silver and cash industry has these two virtues. They probably consider the income from this 1% to be no better than their willingness to serve. Therefore, I propose a "one li for education" initiative to present to the Shanghai financial community, which does not shirk responsibility and bravely does what is right.</p>
<p>Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Painting to Aid Education</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Gongye's calligraphy, painting, seal script, and ink bamboo donations will go towards educational funding. From January 10th to February 9th, prices will not be discounted before the ink dries, as usual, and the ink fee will be waived. Please send pieces to Mr. Ling Ziping at the business department of Shen Hao Guan.</p>
<p>Cantonese Woman Seeking Sewing Work: A Cantonese refugee with excellent sewing skills wants to earn a living by doing sewing for others at a reasonable price, thereby supporting herself through her own efforts. Contact Ms. Zeng at No. 26, Zhenxingfang, Gan Shidong Road, Leimi Road.</p>
<p>Appealing on Behalf of the Family of a Deceased Poor Teacher: My friend, Mr. Xiang Dichu, was a teacher at the former Minzhi and current Runde School. His family is impoverished after his death, with an elderly father above and a widow and orphans below. They have nothing for burial or livelihood, which is very pitiful. I think there is no shortage of benevolent people in society who can sympathize with them. I am making a plea on their behalf. If you would like to provide assistance, please send it to Miss Wang Jingyi, c/o Hengda Clothing Store, East Gate, Jiashan, to be forwarded to Mrs. Xiang Dishi. (Cai Shenfu)</p>

<h3>Written Before the Sale of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>— Renhu</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four necessities of life, and clothing, especially cotton cloth, is paramount. With the exception of a very few special people, it is undoubtedly a necessity of life for every citizen. Especially in this severe winter season, when new clothes are scarce, old clothes are worn out, and patched clothes are beyond repair, citizens are urgently anticipating and expecting the implementation of the cotton cloth rationing system!</p>
<p>Reading Notice No. 21 of the Business and Trade Control Committee, from January 1st of this year, each yarn and cloth retailer is allowed to retain an average monthly retail quantity, and sell half of it. When selling, each citizen is limited to purchasing 1.5 zhang (approximately 5 meters) of cotton cloth, and each business must record the citizen certificate number and name in the account book to indicate the restriction. The long-awaited cotton cloth rationing problem seems to have found a temporary solution. However, I wonder if the quantity sold this time is sufficient to distribute to every citizen qualified with a citizen certificate in the city; otherwise, the terrible scenes of milling rice, pressing oil, and pressing coal balls in the past may reappear in front of the cotton cloth shops, so that the old, weak, women, and children, and those who work tirelessly for a living all day long, will not be able to get even a chi or cun (small units of measurement).</p>
<p>Secondly, we feel that it is inappropriate that children under the age of seven without a citizen certificate do not have the qualifications to purchase cotton cloth. Children are part of the nation, and are the future masters of the country, and we need to cultivate and educate them to preserve new original forces for the country. They also have the same rights to life and legal protection, and the purchase of cotton cloth should of course be no exception. They, like adults, also need the conditions for survival - clothing. The only difference is the amount.</p>
<p>Regarding this sales method, I would like to briefly describe my humble opinions below for the reference of the relevant authorities.</p>
<p>Cotton cloth should also be based on the principle of per capita, such as rice, flour, oil, sugar, soap, matches, and the like. If the procedures are not yet complete, it is possible to use the Phase 50 rice purchase certificate as a cotton cloth purchase certificate and sell it based on the certificate. The sales method can be divided into the following three levels:</p>
<p>(A) Adults over the age of sixteen</p>
<p>The consumption of adults is temporarily assumed to be limited to 1.5 zhang per person, and it is sold based on the certificate and the citizen certificate that matches the person.</p>
<p>(B) Children aged seven to sixteen</p>
<p>For children under the age of sixteen with citizen certificates, it is temporarily assumed that they are limited to 1.2 zhang per person, and it is sold based on the certificate and the citizen certificate that matches the person.</p>
<p>(C) Infants under the age of seven</p>
<p>Infants under the age of seven, even those in swaddling clothes, can be sold based on the certificate, and the purchase amount may be assumed to be 8 chi per person.</p>
<p>Because the goods sold are all retained by each business, scattered in various places, and the quantity is different, it is difficult to divide them, which is slightly different from the distribution of other items. Therefore,</p>
<p>1 Establish Public Sales Offices: The authorities can designate several larger cotton cloth shops as public sales offices, combine the goods from smaller shops, verify the quantity, and sell them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>2 Announce the locations and dates of the Public Sales Offices: Disclose in the newspapers the designated purchasing dates for the designated purchase certificate numbers and the designated public sales offices, just like other rationing methods, so that citizens know and avoid crowding.</p>
<p>In addition, the liaison with the Baojia authorities should be used to count the population of the aforementioned three age groups and the amount of rice certificates issued as preparation for the number of cotton cloths to be sold. Since the sale of cotton cloth has been suspended for a long time, the demand from citizens is extremely urgent, and the sales date cannot be delayed. If time does not permit the above procedures, it is possible to adopt a dual approach, taking care of both aspects at the same time. Start selling on one hand and begin statistics on the other. In short, if there is a shortfall, please ask the authorities to replenish it so that every citizen can get this minimum purchase amount.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters, Declaration by Minister Chen (concurrently holding the position)</h3>
<p>Two years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asian War. The main forces continue to clash, and the war situation becomes increasingly tragic and intense. At this time of critical circumstances, the one hundred million citizens of our ally, Japan, are united, advancing with conviction and sincerity, striving to lay the foundation and strengthen the offensive of the decisive battle, and cultivate and enrich their combat power. On the front lines, from the frigid Aleutian Islands in the north to the scorching southwestern Pacific Ocean, including the Solomon Islands, Gilbert Islands, Burma, and Southeast Asia, our loyal and brave allied warriors are demonstrating their might, ensuring an ever-strengthening offensive with strategies that win every battle and overcome every obstacle, engaging with the enemy. Although the enemy has launched repeated large-scale counterattacks, our allies have not only shattered the enemy's intentions in the naval battles of Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands but also inflicted heavy damage on the enemy's fleet. We are truly filled with admiration for such victories.</p>
<p>This great war aims at the permanent liberation of all the peoples of East Asia, that is, to fight for the independence and self-existence of all nations within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, we are fighting with the strength of the one billion people of East Asia. Since China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of last year, it has shouldered a significant mission in this war. All our citizens, whether officials or common people, whether from the business, academic, or economic sectors, or the general public, should rise up and advance together.</p>
<p>The enemy countries, Britain and the United States, regard this year as the year of total counter-offensive, relying solely on their abundant productive power, and have launched repeated counter-offensives in the southwestern Pacific region, but not only are they ineffective, but they have suffered enormous losses. The United States intends to use its air force stationed in China to bomb major cities along the Yangtze River and important military bases, disrupting peaceful areas. We must prepare early for this kind of desperate attempt by a trapped beast, in case of emergency. There are those who say that the enemy's air control over Shanghai may not become a reality, and even if they attack, it will only be limited to a part of the region. This kind of optimistic speculation is enough to fall into the enemy's self-proclaimed propaganda strategy. Once something happens, it will inevitably lead to panic and immeasurable harm. We must know that Britain and the United States, with their low effectiveness in the total counter-offensive, will blindly disrupt Shanghai, our economic center, which is also expected. At that time, whether it is military facilities or not, they will be affected, and whether it is innocent people or not, they will be sacrificed. As the saying goes, "Do not forget danger in times of peace." It also says, "Preparedness averts peril." Therefore, we should rise up urgently to ensure complete safety.</p>
<p>From this situation, we can see that the establishment of complete civil air defense preparation is urgently needed by the citizens of Shanghai. This minister also believes that it is necessary to establish a public air defense system and has considered it early. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipality Civil Defense Headquarters was established in the First District Public Office to study how to plan a complete path in case of an air raid and how to prepare measures without any omissions when danger is imminent. However, unless all the citizens of Shanghai closely contact and actively cooperate with the Civil Defense Headquarters, it cannot be expected to form a complete air defense barrier to protect Shanghai.</p>
<p>Once Shanghai is subjected to enemy air raids and bombings, the headquarters will give the public appropriate instructions in order to minimize the damage to the lives and property of the citizens of this city. Therefore, we sincerely hope that all citizens can deeply understand this purpose and strictly abide by the instructions of the authorities, so that the lives and property of each person can be adequately protected, and the security of this city can be strengthened. This minister has high hopes for this.</p>
