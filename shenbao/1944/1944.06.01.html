<h3 id="c1">整頓學校 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>吾人始終認敎育問題爲各項重要問題之一，故迭次有所檢討論列，以期引起各方面尤其主管敎育當局之注意，而加以改革與推進。</p>
<p>四月二十八日東京朝日新聞揭載日本文部小最近整頓學校之要綱，本報已於五月二十日披露其譯文。扼其值得重視之要點有四：　日本以整頓學校列爲戰時非常措置之一，可見戰時非常措置應包括敎育，而敎育亦應有戰時之非常措置。日本爲此次戰事之中心，其應付各方面軍事之緊張與錯綜，不難想像，不但不因此而使敎育偏廢，反以最大之努力而從事整頓。　文部省爲補償因此次之非常措置致私立學校之經營負擔激增起見，以助成理工科設備爲中心，決定於十八年度支出二百五十萬圓，十九年度七百五十萬圓，合計一千萬圓。至於理工科設備上亟需者，今後得請求由預備金支出。可見敎育爲國家之事業，政府對於私立學校不特應加統制，且於必要時應加以資助。　調整校內各科目之學生人數，使文理原有之比例七·五對二·五，轉變爲理想之比例三對七。同時新設立之工業專門學校竟達十七所之多，其中包括航空工業滑空工業電波工業石油工業以及其他各項工業等。可見敎育事業須有重心，而不能任其自生自滅，蓋目前及最近將來所急需之技術人材，若不及早培養，必致影響國家生存之命脈。　合併性質相似而非急需之學校，以期節省經費而限制人數。可見學校之目的不在養成高等遊民，學校之性質與多寡宜按需要而規定，粗制濫造之結果，不僅毀滅靑年，抑且危害國家。</p>
<p>現在正當舊學年結束之際，距新學年之開始尙有四月，爰將他人整頓學校之情緒，提供敎育界之參考。主管當局若能認識其所主管敎育事業之責任，亟宜著手計劃節節推進，則下學年尙可付實施，早一日上軌道，便早一日收效果，而少斵喪一分元氣。有志者事竟成，任何困難均不足爲廢馳敎育之口實。惟其有種種困難，更須加倍努力，以熱情與勇氣爲武器，以求戰勝一切，直接奠定敎育之新基礎，間接創造國家之新生命。</p>
<p>我國自創設近代式學校以來，始終未能負起其應有之使命，而敎育界之腐敗與銷沈，確乎於今最烈。欲詳論其興革之道，絕非此短篇所能盡。茲姑卑母高論，捉供兩點以資研討：　如何使敎者確能盡其敎之責任？　如何使學者確能感到學之興趣？願各有關方面先就此求得答案，作爲整頓學校之初步方案，下學期開始實行。然後一方面騐其效果，一方面再求進一步之整頓，從速完成適合中國國情之整個敎育事業，則敎育界前途幸甚！中國前途幸甚！</p>
<h3 id="c2">必阿克島敵登陸　日軍晝夜邀擊中　美巡艦運輸船沉毀十餘艘 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日大本營五月三十一日下午三時半發表：五月二十七日晨，敵有力部隊曾於新幾內亞西北方必阿克島上陸，駐守該島之日軍守備隊及該方面之空軍部隊，當對之邀擊，刻仍激戰中。至現在已判明之日空軍戰果如下：擊沉敵巡洋艦一艘，炸沉輸送艦一艘，小型運輸艦及其他六艘至七艘，炸燬艦船三艘（大型一艘），小型運輸船二艘。</p>
<p>東京三十一日中央社電　美軍有力機動部隊，二十七日黎明來襲新幾內亞對馬頭半島東方百二十公里之必阿克島，首作猛烈之大砲射擊，七時頃開始登陸，該處日軍部隊當即　擊之，日軍除於白心晝攻擊外，更繼之以夜襲，且於晝間敵軍登陸後，肉搏戰即未曾間斷，故予敵以重創。尤其二十八日，敵曾以水陸兩用坦克車爲先導前進，日軍戰車部隊對此即作果敢之集團突擊，殆將敵軍全員追落海內。日軍之勇敢精神，即敵方亦承認之，如其戰報中所云，必阿克島之日軍，對南太平洋戰域美軍之沿島進攻作戰，其抵抗之烈，乃前所未有者。又該方面日軍航空部隊，亦協力陸地部隊奮戰，連日對該島海面之敵機動部隊並對攻擊橋頭堡之敵軍予以重創，至今日止，僅確實之戰果，計炸沉敵巡洋艦一艘，運輸船一艘，駁船及其他六艘乃至七艘，火毀艦船三艘（內一艘爲大型者），駁船三艘，以上各艦船並均起火。按敵軍曾於四月二十二日在新幾內亞島之阿伊塔白，荷蘭地區登陸，各地及威瓦克，馬當地區之日軍，即於其登陸地點附近作楔形陣地，陰敵向內地進犯。自四月下旬起，至五月上旬，於阿伊塔伯東五十公里之島勞附近擊潰敵軍一聯隊，於敵攻路之側背形成嚴然之威力圈，因之敵又制壓西部新幾內亞，爲圖鞏固其自身之地位，乃出此於必阿克島登陸之舉，至目前在必阿克島登陸之敵軍，約有一師之衆，相信該島日軍與新幾內之日軍，其邀擊戰果，今後必能與日俱增也。</p>
<h3 id="c3">豫省日軍進展神速　復興建設猛晉　日陸軍報道部發言人談 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>盟邦上海陸軍報道部，昨（卅一日）下午三時循例假南京路外灘華　飯店八樓，舉行報道常會，陸軍部報道部發言人就河南作戰日軍之神速成功，及復興建設狀況，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>日軍實力估計錯誤</p>
<p>首稱此次河南作戰，日軍獲得偉大的成功，渝方驚惶失措，英美亦狼狽異常，敵方對此次日軍之神速成功驚奇不止，殘餘渝軍已陷於無法收拾之境。再日軍於渝軍驚魂未定時，又從洞庭湖兩側向渝之第六第九戰區開始進攻，日軍之神速行動，使渝軍無從測斷，更爲惶恐萬分。當初渝軍對日軍之實力估計錯誤，如今雖已明瞭日軍之實力充沛龐大，但猶未能詳悉日軍之實力程度，及今後之動向，渝方在軍事上已深覺無從判斷。目前渝軍在大敗之後，翼圖設法挽回，對今後之防禦戰略，當予充分準備，但對日軍之反攻，則深感意外。</p>
<p>日軍攻豫首先安民</p>
<p>旋發言人就此次日軍佔領河南陜西兩省間之盧氏爲例，謂日軍佔領盧氏後，在軍事上之目的已達，即在二十日作完成任務之撤退，立刻恢復原來狀態，並將經過情形，於二十八日予以發表，詎料渝軍事發言人，竟加掩飾，佯稱盧氏已於二十八日克復，孰知日軍離盧氏之日，渝軍猶未得悉，在八日後經日軍發表後，方始發覺，渝軍對日軍之進退，無從判斷，顯已呈現混亂狀態。又謂當河南作戰開始時，日軍即發貼安民布吿，其內容：　豁見人民納稅，　通貨繼續施用，　如日軍向人民購物時，一律繳付代價，　不論軍政中日人民，凡有不法行爲，概予嚴辦不貸，　有通敵行爲者，一律按照軍法重辦。觀於上述內容，即可知對善良人民，決無危害且加以保障。</p>
<p>河南建設突飛猛晋</p>
<p>並謂茲布吿之內容，充分表明日軍之態度公平，凡有不法行爲者，不問中日人民同等待遇，以是一般人民，無不歡迎，非常愉快。戰後之河南建設復興，突飛猛晋，即以鄭州而言，在開戰之第八日，即成立治安維持會縣商會，並設立各區公署，至目前爲止，一般人民大半歸還，不但治安恢復行政組織健全，而在人民娛樂身心上，特建搭臨時茅屋頗多，雖設備簡陋，每日滿座，深令人驚奇不止，此外當地居民自動武裝，協助日軍，在湯恩伯軍潰退時，深慮湯軍之擄掠，以保衛本身財產，當湯部駐紥時，對一般人民苛徵　歛，引起反感，充分暴露人民之厭惡。</p>
<p>人民厭惡渝軍暴虐</p>
<p>人民不滿渝方之原因，絕非一日所致，實因歷年積怨，如數年前渝軍在中牟縣已將黃河決口，使河南洪水爲災，頓成澤國，人民犧牲者無數，對此暴虐政策，致怨恨加深，是時日軍對治水工作，頗爲重視，人民在受惠之下，感謝日軍，故當日軍抵達時，即大事歡迎，並翩然來歸，尤以在中牟附近開始作戰時，治安良好非常，而日軍對人民之熱忱力，亦出於意料，他如建設鐵道及一切復興建設工作，莫不自動協力，進行非常順利。再如日軍進攻洛陽之初，盡力避免該地絲毫損失，洛陽在歷史上之遣跡頗多，日軍極力愛護，雖在作戰方面感有困難，絕不因進攻之速度而加以摧毀，而渝湯恩伯軍則不然，毫無顧慮，祗知擄掠放火，頑強抵抗，致城內頗有相當損害，日軍對此，殊深遺憾。</p>
<p>日軍精神勇毅果敢</p>
<p>關於此次日軍作戰之成功，渝方亦極力宣傳，謂日軍制勝原因，乃擁有大量機械化部隊，日軍對此未予反駁，然具有大量機械化部隊時，並須有果敢勇毅精神，在開戰時中歷四十日，日軍步行千五百里，平均每日三十七里，勇敢神速精神，即日軍之機動力量，乃日軍勝利之極大原因。故此次日軍之成功，已成爲鐵一般事實，而渝方故作宣傳，不足重視，蓋日軍自進軍以來，地區遼闊，必須佔領點作爲據點，佔領根據地後，在綫的方面，難免有渝方之小規模游擊，彼輩欲盤據，絕難久長，一旦日軍發覺，即加以追擊，予以消滅。又日軍此次佔領盧氏完畢任務後之撤退，在軍事上之目的，乃將蔣鼎文在洛陽之部隊予以包圍，並切斷隴海路盧氏兩處蔣之退路，當日軍從隴海路包抄時，一方佔領盧氏洛陽，使蔣軍成爲變中之　，故洛陽佔領後，盧氏已無軍事上價值，及加以放棄，此即爲包圍牽制之戰略云云。</p>

<p>北平三十一日中央社電　駐渝美空軍屢作遊擊性之蠢動，邇來竟波及北京地區，三十日上午有北美P51型戰鬥機二架來襲，經日方猛攻，捕獲其一架，另一架亦被擊退，是役日方毫無損失。日華北派遣軍當局三十日夜，發表如次：三十日十一時半，有敵方P51型戰鬥機二架，來襲北京西北地區，其中一架於山西省河津附近失事，陸着被日軍捕獲。</p>

<p>東京三十一日中央社電　日大東亞省三十一日發表，頃任命大東亞書記官華山親義，爲駐中華民國大使館參事官兼任北平總領事。</p>
<h3 id="c7">義駐華大使　將來華履新 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>南京三十一日中央社電　義大利國政府擬任命蘇比尼爲駐華代理大使，業經盟邦日本代向我國民政府徵得同意，幷悉蘇大使不日即將來華履新。按中義邦交過去夙極敦睦，迨義國發生政變後，因種種關係，其駐華大使館曾停止活動。茲者義統帥墨索里尼領導下之政權業經樹立，故特決定遣使駐華，今後中義邦交，必將因新大使蒞任而愈臻親睦。我舉國朝野對此咸寄於莫大期待，與熱烈之歡迎。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日駐義大使　崛切氏談話 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>滿洲里三十一日中央社電　日前駐義大使堀切善兵衛氏，經蘇聯歸國，三十日抵滿洲里，發表談話如次：餘自歐洲完成任務返亞洲，實覺感概無量。義大利之失敗原因，實不外因國民中有抱厭戰之敗戰主義思想者所致，使巴特里奧之背叛得吿成功。他方亦囚法西斯蒂幹部中，有如齊亞諾輩之思想不健全份子存在，此爲崩潰之一原因。更因西西里島之敗戰，與美軍之奇襲轟炸，使墨索裡尼統帥之國民組織漸弱，而遂致崩潰。是以墨索裡尼統帥現爲恢復當年之義大利，爲再行改編其軍隊，刻正集中精力，極力奔走，而昔厭戰之流，皆已屈服於美·英之前，此即義大利敗戰之第一原因。余當歸國敬信賴之祖國日本全國民者，即無論發生如何事態，亦勿作敗戰主義者。美·英刻雖呼號結成第二戰綫，然以德國爲中心之軸心各國，爲對抗敵方第二戰綫，特置重點於歐洲要塞之防衛，英·美倘於歐洲登陸時，則必立將其擊滅，此已有萬全準備。</p>

<p>北平卅一日中央社電　本年度華北小麥收穫狀況，呈近年稀有之豐收現象。據最近各方呈報，華北合作事業總會之第二次收穫報吿稱，此次收獲較本年二月之第一次收獲，竟獲得豫想外之良好成績，總收獲量爲百四十八萬噸，幾一躍增收第一次之二倍。其他各省增收之成績亦頗佳，此乃係第二次耕種期間之降雨量，較第一次豐收之結果如是。河南省北部之蟲害，及山東省一部旱災，亦可不致成何問題，此次增收總額，最少亦較去年突破百萬噸之巨云。</p>

<p>仰光三十一日中央社電　敵軍自派遣空軍部隊降落緬甸北部後，而謠傳謂彼等已奪回緬甸北部，其後經日軍各精銳部隊猛攻其側背，北緬又突降豪雨，故該處之敵即　於極度徬徨之苦境。日軍各部隊爲此，特於二十三日傍晚開始行動，以期撤底掃蕩該處敵軍，上下經判明之戰果，計敵遺屍經確認者二百具以上，鹵獲運輸機五架（內有一架尙未經破壞），基他軍需品甚夥。</p>

<p>友松圓締</p>

<p>此次是鄙人第三次訪問上海，自念甚為榮幸，滬戰以後，上海雖然曾經犧牲不少貴重的生命與財產，但市街之中心區域，於二十年前並無甚變化，行路之人，仍然熙熙攘攘，隨處表現充分的樂觀與希望，而鄙人此次從中國及日本朋友之間，獲得種種理解與協助，均為前兩度所未有，尤覺</p>
<p>欣然無比</p>
<p>此次蒙新聞報·申報兩社招聘，擔任「戰時學術講座」的　師，在文化上得有效力的機會，實覺非常光榮。鄙人對，即為大東亞戰爭之思想的意義。自從去年一月九日以來，諸君已為吾。儕之戰友，而從事處理中國革命之結論、中國不嘗受這種苦難，不能完成其獨立與自主，中國之青年不能希望輕而易舉的走近路，在進行中的大東亞戰爭，便是以血的代價，實現我民主義中民族主義為目的而發生的戰爭，中國有五千年之文化有過很大的貢獻，此種高度的中國文化自體為何，殊應加以反省，決不是形式上複歸於古典的意味，必須要恢復中國。</p>
<p>孔孟老莊</p>
<p>所領導的偉大的精神，七十五年前日本完成明治維新，是為日本古典精神之反省，中國現已與「大東亞諸民族」親善合作，其目的即為恢復中國本來古典，精神於民族意識中國在過去所展開的建設，並不是「中國的中國」實在是「大東亞的中國」或是「中國的大東亞」，九時一點而言，鄙學者，思想家，尤其是與佛敎有關係的僧尼居士等，互相切　，同時更願與耶穌教各有關係者，從宗敎的立塲，為關於此項問題的討論，俾對於「知日」「知華」運動，能有壤亞思想共榮圈文化新秩序等，為具體的硏究，以上不過略述所懷，請求諸君指教。</p>

<p>然因演習項目，漸見高度，故缺陷亦隨之增加，由此次之訓練成果而觀，可知上海市之防空距離完善之境尚遠，尤其民間各指導機關及從事訓練者，雖相當努力，然仍有多數人士，以觀劇能度傍觀閒眺，實為憾事。在燈火管制方面絞之過去數次訓練，成請最為不良，尤其對於燈火管制不良之房屋，今後決予以澈底強化，查上次曾將一部份通常管制規程加以改正，致一般人士威因此誤會燈火管制巳見緩和，其實上次改正者，乃通常管制，此外警戒管制及空襲管制，仍嚴密如昔，絕不緩和，希望市民切勿誤會。</p>
<p>演習項目</p>
<p>茲將各演習項目分述於次：　避難訓練：（甲）空襲警報發出後，避難避難動作，大　良好，此後尚有稍加迅速之必要。（丙）有多數市民，仍漫然安坐於電車，汽車，三下車避難於適當場所。　各種燈火管制法之徹底，此項較以往訓練，最為不良，尤其天窗等處，仍多漏光，又主要公司事務等，因值班員之懈怠頗有漏光，以後對於此項不良房屋，決加以嚴厲處罰，同時並有澈底強化其指導之</p>
<p>（甲）通常管制警戒管制，空襲管制之區別，並各管制之轉移。尚未見十分徹底，希望市民各位對於此三種管制之種別，特予充分研究，加以明確認識，尤其當二十九日晨，實施警戒管制及三十日夜空襲警報解除後，至訓練終了止之警戒管制，最為不良。通常管制，僅須以挪幕隱蔽而空襲管制及警戒管制，則不可如此簡單，對於此點區別，應茅充分認識。</p>
<p>（乙）警戒管制及空襲管制時，黑幕之間隙，頗為漏光，以後對於黑幕邊緣，應遮蔽嚴密。</p>
<p>（丙）高層建築物之橫側背面，並一般房屋之天窗管制，仍屬不良，應須施以充分遮光設備。</p>
<p>（丁）有一部份人士並不採取紐光辦法，僅將電燈熄滅，以冀一時敷析，故各防護團應徹底之取締。</p>
<p>（戊）電筒亦應適當減光。</p>
<p>（己）最近汽車之前照燈管制頗為不良，如遮光油漆，已有剝落，應重加塗漆，今後並須隨時檢查，凡管制不良者，應予徹底取締。　影響交通管制，概屬良好。然左列各點應予注意：</p>
<p>（甲）空襲警報發生後，凡無緊要念務者，應勿外出，然實際上們多浸步行走者，以後各人應固守自己職域待　應愛。</p>
<p>（乙）警戒管制，空襲管制下，不守交通規則，未經許可之各汽車，在空製警報期間內，任意行駛。查空襲警報期間內，除「軍公用」及持有「非常用」車輛特別通行許可證之汽車外，一律不許行駛，今後凡再有此種情事者，決吊銷其駛車證。　工作並救護訓練，概場良好，然左列各點，有加以考慮必要，（甲）工作訓練以迅速發見筱害處所為第一，故工作班與陰部之連絡，應須充分，（乙）關於救護訓練，全部市民對於應念止血法，應有熟知之必要，蓋在未經送空醫院之前，能否適常止血，對於負傷者生命，至有莫大之關係也。　各種應急通信聯絡並警報傳達怯，大致良好，能達到預期目的，然在大建築物內對於被書媒所及通知狀況之聯絡方法，尚未適當，各負責人實有從速研究採取「鳴笛」信號、及「手勢」信號等聯絡方法之必耍。又民間各指導機闢，亦有從速整理此項通信歸絡資材之必耍，綜上所述，可知防空方面尚多娩要研究改善之處，至各地區再須訓練事項，已分別通知其研究，以確立中外一體之民問防空能勢。又對於此次訓練中因事故負傷者，殊表歉意，尚望一般市民對於事故之防止，今後益加注意，最後對始終在惡條件下積極努力之各指導機關，並從事訓練者表示謝意。</p>

<p>— 顏福慶</p>
<p>每屆夏令，時疫流行，尤以霍亂陽熱病痢疾腹瀉等為最。且氣候炎然，利於昆蟲之活動，蚊蠅蚤蝨大肆猖獗，於是由此等昆蟲播傳之疾病亦　形增加，如瘧病斑疹傷寒等皆是。處此非常時期，舉凡生活所需各項俱感困難，一屋之內居住多人，地位狹仄，空氣汚　，飲食即因陋就簡，營養不足，影響吾人之抵抗力至鉅。是以今夏時症之流行實屬意中之事。本市衛生當局有鑒於此，爰有夏令衛生運動之發起，自六月一日起至七日止，舉行一週。籍以喚起市民對於夏令衛生之注意，此次衛生運動，除舉辦衛生展　外，並有播音演講，灌輪民衆衛生常識，而為實施衛生方針起見，復有淸潔運動與撲滅蚊蠅運動之舉行。</p>
<p>社會一般人士大都以為醫師之任務在於治病，吾人患病以後始就醫求治，此外無所求於醫者。此種觀念實屬錯誤，須知整個之醫事事業包三大部份即治療，預防，與保健是也。而預防保健實較治療為尤要，蓋患病以後始行京醫，往往耗費鉅金，而未必有良好之效果，若能於平日聘請醫師爲顧問，指導吾人預防保健之方法，則所費少而獲益多。據某著名醫學家之估計，以一元錢用於治療方面，所得效果僅值二角，用於預防方面，所獲利益計值三角，而用保健方面，則至少可得五角之利益。蓋就現代醫學進步之程度而言，疾病之能診斷確定及有特效機治者實屬少數，然多數可加預防。茲特舉傷寒肺癆及白喉三症分述如下：</p>
<p>傷寒　傷寒一症初無特效療法，患者每多不治，即幸得告痊，亦已臥床累月，延醫服藥，所費不貨，惟如於平日受預防注射，則可保證兩年以內不染此症。</p>
<p>肺癆　肺癆傳染最廣，根據最近之統計，全球人民百分之九〇均受肺癆之感染，十五歲以下之兒童感染此症者，亦達百分之二七。三〇，但在抵抗力强者，病菌潛伏不致發作，一旦體力衰弱，抵抗能力减退，於是　能　露。是故受肺癆之感染者，必須注重衛生從事休養，多吸新鮮空氣，多進富於滋養料之飲食，藉以增加抵抗疾病之能力，使疾病不致發作。如肺癆巳成，則亦惟有休息靜養，注意營養，其他種種方法僅具補助之功，且必須於早期行之，始有治愈之望。若病巳入晚期，則雖耗費鉅金，　石亂投，亦屬無效。</p>
<p>白喉　白喉一症，在血淸療法發明以前，患者大都不治，且病屬急性，來勢凶猛，往往罹疾後數小時或一二日內，即行身亡。今則不惟有特效之療法，且能加以預防，此外更能診斷各人對於白喉有無抵抗之能力，如察見某人無抵抗此症之能力，可設法增加其抵抗力，而使其免於傳染。若不幸而染疾則施以血濟療法，即可告痊，然治療過遲，亦往往不能見效，即令治愈而毒入腦髓，致成瘓癱，故即如白喉療法堪稱最具把握者，猶須及早施治，方能湊效，且亦以預防爲上策也。</p>
<p>此次衛生運動中有淸潔運動一項，爰就淸潔之耍點加以討論，美國衛生學家洛斯那氏（Rosenau）曾謂如人人能注意淸潔，則人類之疾病可減去一半，所謂淸潔包括個人淸潔衣服淸潔飲食淸潔公共塲所淸潔等，尤以家庭淸潔最為重要，以其對於吾人之健康最有影響，如人人能於進餐前洗手，即可減少許多疾病之傳染。</p>
<p>淸潔可分為有形與無形二種，里弄之中，垃圾堆積，汚物狼藉，人人得以見之，人人知其不潔，此有形之不潔也。然有肉眼所不能見之不潔，形似淸潔，實則對於人體之健康最有危害，以其不為人所覺察，而殺人於不知不覺之中也。就衛生之觀點而言，淸潔可分為二類，即表面的淸潔與實際的淸潔是也。換言之，淸潔之標準在於有無病菌存在，而不在於外表如何，表面之淸潔與否，可以肉眼難之，而實際之淸潔與否，則非於顯微鏡下觀察之不可。</p>
<p>夏令疾病種類繁多，而以霍亂痢疾傷寒為主，此等疾病大都由飲食不潔所致，就衛生之立塲而誓，此等疾病實為百病中之最汚穢者。蓋其病菌含於病人之糞便中，蒼蠅叮過後，其爪上帶有糞便。共後飛至食物或食具停着。而將養便遺留其上，吾人食此項食物，或以此項食具盛物，即有染疾之危害。雖然此種傳染方法，猶爲吾人所能見到想到，故可加以預防，惟有無形之傳染方法，則爲吾人所不加注意，疏於防範，故其為書最烈。如　井於菜園或毛則之旁，天雨以後，　水流入井中，而因其曾在泥土上滬過，狀頗澄淸，實則其中含有無數細菌，吾人飲用此項井水，或以之洗滌器具，即有　疾之虞。惟若將其沸煮或消毒，即可安心飲用。消毒方法頗多，其最簡易而有效有，厥惟以一份漂白粉投一百萬份之水中。即能消毒滅菌。</p>
<p>欲預防夏令疾病之傳染流行，必須注重淸潔。已如上述，此外預防注射尤屬重要。每見有人以不耐反應之痛古，而不願受注射，但如一念及染疾以後呻吟病極之苦，或甚至有性命之憂，則區區反應，誠不足介意矣。</p>
<h3 id="c39">爲夏令衛生運動大會吿市民書 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>各位同胞！今天是衛損失多少呢？</p>
<p>生運動大會開幕的一天，提起了「衛生」二字，凡是受過敎育的人，大槪都能瞭解，而且大家都知道是得重要的；然而吾們中國目前的衛生狀况如何呢？人民的健康程度又如何呢？據專家的估計吾國的死亡率，約有千分之三十，比歐美各國多至一倍，每年死亡數約達一千二百萬人，其中最少有一半，因不知「衛生」而死於非命，試問國家和私人雙方</p>
<p>有人以爲這「衛生」是奢侈的行為，祗好讓有錢的人去享受，在這食不飽，衣不　的年頭，窮人那裏做得到，其實窮人因爲受了經濟的限制，常常遭遇着不衛生的生活，到要此有產的人更要　究衛生，况且有許多衛生，不一定要錢，譬如一切飲食起居有一定的規律，實行一切衛生習慣，把生活規律化等，都是不用化錢而容易做到的事情。</p>
<p>各位同胞！上面所說的把生活夫律化等，還不過是個人衛生，進一步應該推及到公共衛生，提倡公共衛生，要從衛生道德做出發點，提倡公共衛生雖然是以個人衛生做基礎，然市民之中還有許多祇顧自己，而不顧公德的份子，自己身上謂究衛生，而家庭中可以不管，或家庭講究淸潔，而公共環境衛生就不顧，把自己家裏的垃圾，糞便，汚水任意倒在為路上，而妨碍公共衛生，這種舉動，實在太幼稚了，結果不但妨碍別人，而且危害了自己，因為傳染病的發生，都是由許多汚物垃圾裏發生出來的，尤其在夏天，這許多垃圾裏包含的無數細菌，經過太陽的蒸發，繁殖力很快，再經過蚊蠅的媒介，傳染病自然容易發生，例如霍亂病一經發生，裏延起來很快，一個人生了病，立刻就能傳染到鄰舍衆人，甚至一鄕，一縣，一團都有傳染到的可能性。</p>
<p>衛生運動的目的，是促進市民注意公共衛生，藉以減少疾病，使國民個個都有健全的體魄，增長壽命，去做富國強民偉大事業。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Streamlining Schools <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>We have consistently considered the issue of education to be among the most important, and have therefore repeatedly discussed and analyzed it, hoping to attract attention from all sectors, especially the relevant educational authorities, so that reform and advancement can be implemented.</p>
<p>On April 28th, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an outline of the recent streamlining of schools by the Japanese Ministry of Education. Our newspaper published a translation of it on May 20th. Four key points are worth emphasizing: Japan has designated the streamlining of schools as one of the wartime emergency measures, demonstrating that wartime emergency measures should include education, and that education should also have its own wartime emergency measures. As the center of this war, Japan's handling of the tension and complexity of various military fronts is unimaginable. Not only does it not neglect education because of this, but it also strives to streamline it with the greatest effort. The Ministry of Education, in order to compensate for the drastic increase in the operating burden of private schools due to this emergency measure, has decided to spend 2.5 million yen in the 18th fiscal year and 7.5 million yen in the 19th fiscal year, totaling 10 million yen, focusing on assisting the equipment of science and engineering departments. As for the urgent needs in science and engineering equipment, requests can be made for disbursement from the reserve fund in the future. This shows that education is a national undertaking, and the government should not only regulate private schools but also provide assistance when necessary. The adjustment of the number of students in each subject within the school should shift the original ratio of arts and sciences from 7.5 to 2.5 to an ideal ratio of 3 to 7. At the same time, as many as 17 new industrial vocational schools have been established, including aviation industry, gliding industry, radio wave industry, petroleum industry, and other industrial sectors. This shows that education must have a focus and cannot be left to fend for itself. If the technical talents urgently needed now and in the near future are not cultivated early, it will inevitably affect the lifeblood of the country. Schools with similar characteristics that are not urgently needed should be merged in order to save costs and limit the number of people. This shows that the purpose of schools is not to train high-level idlers, and the nature and number of schools should be determined according to needs. The result of shoddy work and mass production will not only destroy youth but also endanger the country.</p>
<p>Now, as the old school year comes to an end, with four months remaining before the start of the new school year, we provide the sentiments of others in streamlining schools for the reference of the education community. If the responsible authorities can recognize their responsibility for the educational undertaking they manage, they should immediately start planning and promoting it step by step, so that it can be implemented in the next school year. The sooner it gets on track, the sooner it will be effective and the less vitality will be lost. Those with aspirations will succeed. No difficulties are sufficient excuse for abandoning education. Precisely because there are various difficulties, greater efforts must be made, using passion and courage as weapons, in order to overcome everything, directly laying a new foundation for education and indirectly creating a new life for the nation.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of modern schools in our country, they have consistently failed to fulfill their due mission, and the corruption and decline of the education community are indeed most severe today. To discuss the ways of reform in detail is beyond the scope of this short article. Now, we humbly offer two points for discussion: How to ensure that teachers can truly fulfill their teaching responsibilities? How to ensure that students can truly feel the interest of learning? We hope that all relevant parties will first find answers to these questions and use them as a preliminary plan for streamlining schools, to be implemented at the beginning of the next semester. Then, on the one hand, verify its effectiveness, and on the other hand, seek further streamlining as soon as possible to complete the entire education undertaking that is suitable for China's national conditions. Then the future of the education community will be fortunate! The future of China will be fortunate!</p>
<h3 id="e2">Enemy Landing on Biak Island - Japanese Army Engaged in Day and Night Combat - More Than Ten American Cruisers and Transport Ships Sunk and Destroyed <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on May 31st: On the morning of May 27th, a powerful enemy force landed on Biak Island, northwest of New Guinea. The Japanese garrison stationed on the island and the air force units in the area immediately engaged them in combat. Fierce fighting is still underway. The results of the Japanese air force's battle, as confirmed so far, are as follows: one enemy cruiser sunk, one transport ship sunk, six to seven small transport ships and others sunk, and three ships destroyed by bombing (one large), and two small transport ships.</p>
<p>Tokyo, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: A powerful American mobile force attacked Biak Island, 120 kilometers east of the Doberai Peninsula in New Guinea, at dawn on the 27th. They first carried out intense artillery fire and began landing at around 7:00 AM. The Japanese forces there immediately engaged them. In addition to daytime attacks, the Japanese army continued with night raids. After the enemy landed during the day, hand-to-hand combat never ceased, causing heavy casualties to the enemy. Especially on the 28th, the enemy advanced with amphibious tanks as the vanguard, and the Japanese tank units made a bold group assault, almost chasing all the enemy troops into the sea. The courageous spirit of the Japanese army is also recognized by the enemy, as stated in their war report: the resistance of the Japanese army on Biak Island against the island-hopping campaign of the American forces in the South Pacific theater is unprecedented. In addition, the Japanese air force in the area also cooperated with the ground forces in fierce fighting. They have been heavily damaging the enemy mobile force on the sea surface near the island and the enemy forces attacking the beachhead for days. To date, the confirmed battle results alone include one enemy cruiser sunk, one transport ship sunk, six or seven barges and others sunk, and three ships set on fire (one of which is large), and three barges. According to reports, the enemy landed on Aitafe and Dutch regions of New Guinea Island on April 22nd. The Japanese army in various places such as Wewak and Madang formed wedge-shaped positions near their landing sites to prevent the enemy from invading inland. From late April to early May, they defeated an enemy regiment near Islao, 50 kilometers east of Aitafe, forming a powerful circle on the side and rear of the enemy's attack route. As a result, the enemy suppressed western New Guinea. In order to consolidate its own position, they took this action to land on Biak Island. At present, the enemy forces that have landed on Biak Island number about one division. It is believed that the Japanese army on the island and the Japanese army in New Guinea will see their results in repelling the enemy increase day by day in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rapid Progress of Japanese Army in Henan Province - Vigorous Advancement of Reconstruction - Spokesman of the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army Press Department of the Allied Powers held its regular press conference yesterday (the 31st) at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. The spokesman of the Army Press Department spoke about the rapid success of the Japanese army in the Henan operation and the situation of reconstruction, as follows:</p>
<p>Miscalculation of Japanese Army Strength</p>
<p>First, he said that the Japanese army had achieved great success in the Henan operation, causing panic among the Chongqing government, and extreme embarrassment for Britain and the United States. The enemy was surprised by the rapid success of the Japanese army, and the remaining Chongqing army was in an unmanageable situation. Furthermore, while the Chongqing army was still in shock, the Japanese army began attacking the sixth and ninth war zones of Chongqing from both sides of Dongting Lake. The rapid action of the Japanese army made it impossible for the Chongqing army to predict, and they were even more panic-stricken. Initially, the Chongqing army miscalculated the strength of the Japanese army. Although they now understand that the Japanese army is strong and powerful, they still do not know the extent of the Japanese army's strength and its future movements. The Chongqing government feels that it is impossible to judge militarily. At present, after the great defeat, the Chongqing army is trying to find ways to recover and will make full preparations for future defensive strategies, but they feel deeply surprised by the Japanese army's counterattack.</p>
<p>Japanese Army First Pacifies the People When Attacking Henan</p>
<p>Then, the spokesman took the Japanese army's occupation of Lushi, located between Henan and Shaanxi provinces, as an example, saying that after the Japanese army occupied Lushi, the military objective had been achieved, and they completed the task and withdrew on the 20th, immediately restoring the original state. The situation was announced on the 28th. Unexpectedly, the Chongqing military spokesman concealed the facts, falsely claiming that Lushi had been recovered on the 28th. In fact, the Chongqing army did not know about the Japanese army's withdrawal until it was announced by the Japanese army eight days later. The Chongqing army was unable to judge the Japanese army's advance and retreat, which clearly showed a state of confusion. He also said that when the Henan operation began, the Japanese army immediately issued an announcement to pacify the people, the contents of which were: Exemption from people's taxes, Continued use of currency, When the Japanese army buys goods from the people, they will pay the price, Anyone, whether in the military or government, Chinese or Japanese, who commits illegal acts will be severely punished without exception, Those who engage in acts of collusion with the enemy will be severely punished according to military law. From the above content, it can be seen that there will be no harm to the good people and they will be protected.</p>
<p>Rapid Advancement of Henan Construction</p>
<p>He also said that the content of this announcement fully demonstrated the fair attitude of the Japanese army. All illegal acts are treated equally, regardless of whether they are committed by Chinese or Japanese people. Therefore, the general public welcomes and is very happy. The construction and reconstruction of Henan after the war has advanced rapidly. Taking Zhengzhou as an example, on the eighth day of the war, the Public Security Maintenance Association County Chamber of Commerce was established, and district offices were also established. So far, most of the general public have returned. Not only has public security been restored and administrative organizations are sound, but also in terms of people's entertainment and physical and mental well-being, many temporary huts have been built. Although the equipment is simple, they are full every day, which is surprising. In addition, local residents voluntarily arm themselves to assist the Japanese army. When Tang Enbo's army retreated, they were deeply concerned about the looting by Tang's army in order to protect their own property. When Tang's troops were stationed, they imposed harsh taxes on the general public, arousing resentment, fully exposing the people's disgust.</p>
<p>The People Dislike the Brutality of the Chongqing Army</p>
<p>The reason why the people are dissatisfied with the Chongqing government is not a result of one day, but a result of years of accumulated grievances. For example, a few years ago, the Chongqing army breached the Yellow River in Zhongmu County, causing the Henan floods to become a disaster, resulting in countless sacrifices. This brutal policy caused deeper resentment. At that time, the Japanese army attached great importance to water management work. The people were grateful to the Japanese army for benefiting from it. Therefore, when the Japanese army arrived, they were greatly welcomed and readily returned. Especially when the fighting started near Zhongmu, the public security was very good, and the enthusiasm of the Japanese army towards the people was also unexpected. In addition, the construction of railways and all reconstruction work were automatically cooperated and progressed very smoothly. Furthermore, when the Japanese army attacked Luoyang, they tried their best to avoid any loss to the area. There are many historical relics in Luoyang, and the Japanese army tried their best to protect them. Although there were difficulties in the combat aspects, they would never destroy them in order to speed up the attack. However, the Chongqing Tang Enbo army was different. They had no regard for anything, only knowing how to loot and set fires, stubbornly resisting, causing considerable damage to the city. The Japanese army deeply regrets this.</p>
<p>The Japanese Army's Spirit is Brave, Resolute, and Decisive</p>
<p>Regarding the success of the Japanese army's operation, the Chongqing government is also vigorously promoting that the reason for the Japanese army's victory is that it possesses a large number of mechanized units. The Japanese army did not refute this, but when possessing a large number of mechanized units, it must also have a resolute and courageous spirit. At the beginning of the war, it took 40 days, and the Japanese army walked 1,500 li, an average of 37 li per day. This brave and rapid spirit, that is, the mobility of the Japanese army, is the greatest reason for the Japanese army's victory. Therefore, the success of the Japanese army has become an ironclad fact, and the Chongqing government's propaganda is not worthy of attention. Since the Japanese army has advanced, the area is vast, and it must occupy points as strongholds. After occupying the base, it is inevitable that the Chongqing government will have small-scale guerrillas on the line. It is extremely difficult for them to occupy the area for a long time. Once the Japanese army discovers it, it will pursue and annihilate them. Furthermore, the Japanese army's withdrawal after completing the task of occupying Lushi was for the military purpose of encircling Jiang Dingwen's troops in Luoyang and cutting off Jiang's retreat routes in Lushi on the Longhai Road. When the Japanese army outflanked from Longhai Road, on the one hand, they occupied Lushi and Luoyang, making Jiang's army in a state of flux. Therefore, after Luoyang was occupied, Lushi had no military value and was abandoned. This is the strategy of encirclement and containment.</p>

<p>Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Italian government intends to appoint Subini as the acting ambassador to China. The Allied Power Japan has obtained the consent of our National Government on its behalf, and it is understood that Ambassador Su will soon come to China to take office. In the past, the diplomatic relations between China and Italy were extremely cordial. After the coup in Italy, due to various reasons, its embassy in China had ceased its activities. Now that the regime under the leadership of Italian Marshal Mussolini has been established, it has decided to send an ambassador to China. In the future, the diplomatic relations between China and Italy will inevitably become more cordial due to the arrival of the new ambassador. The entire nation, both government and people, place great expectations on this and extend a warm welcome.</p>

<p>Manchuria, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Mr. Zenbei Horikiri, the former Japanese Ambassador to Italy, returned home via the Soviet Union and arrived in Manchuria on the 30th. He made the following remarks: I feel very emotional to have returned to Asia from Europe after completing my mission. The reason for Italy's failure is none other than the fact that there were people among the citizens who harbored war-weariness and defeatism, which allowed Badoglio's betrayal to succeed. On the other hand, there were also unsound elements among the Fascist cadres, such as Ciano, which was one of the reasons for the collapse. Furthermore, the defeat in Sicily and the surprise bombing by the American army gradually weakened the national organization under the leadership of Mussolini, leading to its collapse. Therefore, Marshal Mussolini is now concentrating his efforts and making every effort to reorganize his army in order to restore Italy to its former state. The streams of war-weariness have all succumbed before the Americans and the British. This is the primary reason for Italy's defeat. When I return to my country, I will trust that all the citizens of Japan, regardless of what happens, will not become defeatists. Although the Americans and the British are now calling for the formation of a second front, the Axis powers, centered on Germany, are focusing on the defense of the European fortress in order to counter the enemy's second front. If the British and the Americans land in Europe, they will surely be annihilated. They are fully prepared for this.</p>

The total harvest volume is 1.48 million tons, almost doubling the first harvest. The results of increased harvest in other provinces are also quite good. This is due to the rainfall during the second planting period, which is the result of a richer first harvest. The insect pests in the northern part of Henan Province and the drought in a part of Shandong Province will also not cause any problems. The total increase in the harvest this time will break through the huge cloud of 1 million tons more than last year at the very least.</p>

<p>Rangoon, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: After the enemy army dispatched air force units to land in northern Burma and rumored that they had recaptured northern Burma, the various elite units of the Japanese army fiercely attacked their flanks, and northern Burma suddenly had heavy rain. Therefore, the enemy there is mired in extreme distress. For this reason, the various units of the Japanese army began to act on the evening of the 23rd in order to completely mop up the enemy army there. According to the confirmed battle results, more than 200 enemy corpses have been confirmed, and five transport aircraft have been captured (one of which has not been destroyed), as well as a large number of other military supplies.</p>

<p>Rangoon, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Chongqing Yunnan Expeditionary Force under Wei Lihuang attempted to cross the Nujiang River and invade northern Burma, but the various elite units of the Japanese army counterattacked on the spot, so the Chongqing army's attempt has been thwarted. For example, a powerful unit of the Japanese army ambushed 350 Chongqing troops carrying mortars near Hongmu Tree on the 24th at close range and inflicted a fierce attack. As a result, the Chongqing army abandoned 53 corpses, and the Japanese army also seized a large number of ammunition.

<h3 id="e13">Ministry of Finance Decides to Strictly Crack Down on Illegal Financial Institutions - No New Banks or Exchanges Have Been Established in Shanghai Recently <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, May 32nd, Central News Agency Dispatch: It was previously reported that the Ministry of Finance had already cut off registration for financial institutions in Shanghai, but recently Shanghai newspapers often carried announcements of the founding meetings of certain banks or exchanges, or the formal opening date, and the establishment of branch offices. This reporter specifically inquired with the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Finance, who kindly informed me of the handling situation in the past, as follows.</p>
<p>It has been verified that the Ministry has already issued a statement on December 18th of the 31st year regarding financial institutions in Shanghai, cutting off registration. If it is a money exchange organized as a partnership, it has also been explicitly stipulated that it must be converted into a limited liability company before August 20th of the 32nd year, and because the names of financial institutions vary, the Ministry has also stipulated that they must no longer be named "Silver Company" or "Silver Bank," and that "Silver Company" and "Silver Bank" should be uniformly corrected. However, there are occasionally a few banks and money exchanges that have been formally opened recently or have established limited liability companies due to review and preparation matters, or that the date of their basic application was none other than before the cutoff date. The files are available and can all be reviewed. In addition, trust companies that also operate banking businesses have occasionally requested the Ministry to approve changing their name to "Bank" due to business reasons. There are no other newly established financial institutions. As for the applications from banks in various places to establish branches or offices in Shanghai, and the applications from head offices in Shanghai to establish branches or offices in this port, they have been rejected by the Ministry unless there are special circumstances. Recently, a Liangye Bank Co., Ltd., which established its head office in Changzhou, published an announcement in the Zhonghua Daily to convene a temporary shareholders meeting, stating that the bank was scheduled to convene a temporary general meeting of shareholders at 2:00 PM on May 18th at the bank's premises, located on Heng Street, Changzhou County, and that the Shanghai office was located at No. 33 Sichuan Road. As the bank's Shanghai office had not been submitted to the Ministry for approval and was established without authorization, it was a violation of the regulations. The Ministry has ordered the bank to cancel the Shanghai office immediately. If there are any similar situations in the future, they should be strictly cracked down on to uphold the law. Furthermore, the Shanghai Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise Bank and the Dazhai Money Exchange were previously revoked licenses by the Ministry due to mismanagement. The banks and exchanges have successively applied for reinstatement, but have not been approved. The Ministry is always paying attention to the operating status of financial institutions in various places. If there are any improprieties, they will be cracked down on from the rock bottom.</p>

<p>Nanjing, May 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The China Broadcasting Association, which integrates the management of the national broadcasting industry, has been established for three years in an instant. The term of office of the first board of directors was originally scheduled to expire at the end of February, but because important association affairs needed to be sorted out by the old people, the Propaganda Department was asked to extend the term of office of the old board of directors. It is now learned that the association affairs have been sorted out, and recently, in accordance with the regulations, Lin Baisheng, Kiyoshi Uchiyama, Nai Lun Yuan, Kazuo Asano, Yin Kang Wang, Takeji Sasaki, and Renshou Zhong were elected as the second board of directors, and were submitted to the Propaganda Department for approval. Then, in the first board of directors meeting, Lin Baisheng was elected as the chairman. Kiyoshi Uchiyama, Nai Lun Wei, Kazuo Asano, and Yin Kang Wang are managing directors. Mr. Lin has been promoted to chairman since the establishment of the Broadcasting Association. For three years, he has led the association's business with exceptional enthusiasm, and has been re-elected each time, which is gratifying to all parties. Managing Directors Nai Lun Wei and Kazuo Asano were also re-elected from the old team. Yin Kang Wang was originally an ordinary director and director of the Central Broadcasting Station. This time, he was promoted to managing director and continues to serve as director of the station. Kiyoshi Uchiyama is a Japanese diplomatic expert who recently came to China from Thailand. On May 31st, he resigned from his diplomatic post to serve as the managing director of the association. It is expected that the list of directors for this session of the association will be even more well-organized, and will make greater contributions to the development of the broadcasting industry in the future. All parties have expressed intense expectations.</p>

<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced that the focal point of the Allied forces' attacks on the Italian front on the 29th was the area from the Tyrrhenian coast to the Alban Hills. The Allied forces used large groups of tanks and infantry in their assault. Although they temporarily created localized breakthroughs in several places, the German army launched counterattacks to either contain or crush these breakthroughs. Allied forces attacked German positions on both sides of Ceccano with superior forces. After a valiant defense by German rear-guard units, the Allied forces succeeded in breaking into Ceccano.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, the British and American offensive forces on the Italian front have shifted to the western flank. British and American aircraft squadrons relentlessly attacked this flank throughout Monday. The British 2nd Infantry Division, which had not been active previously, also launched an offensive against German positions in the far west under the support of an American tank division. After intense fighting, they managed to penetrate the foremost German defense line. The enemy's offensive in this area was anticipated, so the German High Command had already withdrawn the majority of its forces to pre-prepared positions. The German rearguard units also retreated to these defense lines. Allied attempts to break through the German line northwest of Apulia were thwarted by fierce German resistance. The advance southwest of Villamonte has regained previously held positions, thus averting all crises arising from sudden enemy advances towards Villamonte and Valletri. Allied forces, under the cover of strong tank units, invaded the town of Ceccano. In order to avoid a pointless and costly street battle, the German army withdrew from the town earlier, as the area is suitable for tank operations. The enemy is expected to continue its offensive.</p>

<p>Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - Talk of a European landing operation has become increasingly prevalent recently. During a recent tour of France and the Iberian Peninsula, the reporter's conclusion is that, even if a landing operation occurs, it will not be as imminent as generally imagined. Currently, the topic of conversation everywhere is centered on a European landing operation. If the Allied forces were to land in France, Spain would not be unaffected. There is a sense of anxiety about the possibility of war. In France, the French people directly see the German's active preparations, so most feel that a landing operation will occur within a few days. The German army is constructing fortified gun emplacements along the banks of the Seine, and even the rear base of Paris is fully armed, so the tension among the citizens is not without reason. The transportation lines near Paris are extremely difficult to navigate. Resource conservation is currently being practiced in the area, but a large number of sleepers are piled up on both sides of the railways, so even if the railways are bombed, they can be repaired within a few hours.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Japan and China Should Work Closely Together to Improve Agricultural Production - Professor Sasaki Gives Speech in Nanjing <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency) - Professor Sasaki Kiyozuna, professor at Tokyo Imperial University in Japan and Doctor of Agriculture from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, was invited by the Shanghai Shen Bao and Xin Wen Bao to give wartime academic lectures. He arrived in China by plane on the 18th to serve as a wartime economics lecturer. On the 28th, he was dispatched to Nanjing, where he gave academic lectures at National Central University. His answers to questions raised by reporters are as follows: (Question) What is the current state of agricultural production increase in Japan? (Answer) The general situation is very good. Taking rice cultivation as an example, its output compared to China's output is about 100 to 65. This ratio is obtained by calculating the output before the war and the recent output. The reason why Japan's output is higher than China's is that Japanese farmland fertilization is better than China's, and at the same time, attention is paid to the improvement of varieties and the replacement of improved varieties to increase yields. Secondly, the farmers' organizations in rural Japan are well-organized, and they can cooperate and divide labor to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The production of other miscellaneous grains is also very good. The most important thing is the planting of wheat, followed by the planting of sweet potatoes, because this crop can grow even on barren land, and its vines can be used as feed for livestock, maximizing benefits. (Question) What new discoveries have been made in agricultural production technology by the Japanese agricultural research community recently? (Answer) There are no significant advances in agricultural production technology at present, but there are many in theoretical aspects. (Question) How is food distribution handled during the current Greater East Asia War? (Answer) The national food distribution is progressing very smoothly. Everyone can obtain the necessary food because Japan's social organization is sound, and the neighborhood associations are equivalent to China's Baojia system. From a personal standpoint, Dr. Please give your opinion on the current agricultural production increase work in our country. But in the future, China's agricultural production increase should pay attention to both quality and quantity. When I visited the Shanghai Morning Market in Shanghai, its farming methods were very similar to those in Japan. At that time, I almost suspected that I was in the Kyushu countryside in my own country. Therefore, the improvement of agricultural technology and the selection of excellent varieties in China are no less than in Japan. Finally, he solemnly told the reporter that China has a vast territory and species, and its area is very large, occupying an important position not only in East Asia but also in the world. In the future, we should seek the improvement of crops, and the agricultural technology talents of China and Japan should work closely together to increase agricultural production in order to jointly build the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. In Japan and this time when I came to your country, I lectured in various schools, and I always declared this idea to all students, so as to move forward together and complete the Greater East Asia War.</p>

Then Sasaki explained the central issue of the symposium, the improvement of livestock in our country, and separately explained the breeding of cattle, chickens, etc., exchanged opinions with each other, and the discussion was lively, and the meeting did not end until about three o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Second Invitation to Mr. Tomomatsu to Lecture <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The "Wartime Academic Lecture" jointly organized by Xinwen Bao and this newspaper hired scholars and experts as lecturers. The first invitation was to Japanese agricultural expert Dr. Sasaki, who came to Shanghai and then to Nanjing in mid-May to lecture. The second invitation was to Japanese economics expert Mr. Tomomatsu Entai as a lecturer, who arrived in Shanghai on May 29th and is currently scheduling his lectures. The following is a brief biography and conversation of Mr. Tomomatsu:</p>
<p>Tomomatsu Entai</p>
<p>Professor, born on April 1, Meiji 28 (1895) at 2-2 Miyoshi-cho, Fukagawa-ku, Tokyo, currently 50 years old. Graduated from the Religious University (now Taisho University) in Taisho 8 (1919), and graduated from the Faculty of Literature of Keio Gijuku University in Taisho 13 (1924).

<h3 id="e26">Conversation <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>This is the third time I have visited Shanghai, and I am very honored. Since the Shanghai War, although Shanghai has sacrificed many precious lives and properties, the central area of the city has not changed much from 20 years ago. The people on the road are still bustling, showing plenty of optimism and hope everywhere. This time I have gained all kinds of understanding and assistance from Chinese and Japanese friends, which I did not have in the previous two times, and I feel particularly happy.</p>
<p>This time, I am honored to be invited by Xinwen Bao and Shen Bao to serve as a lecturer for the "Wartime Academic Lecture" and have the opportunity to be effective in culture. What I want to talk about is the ideological significance of the Greater East Asia War. Since January 9 last year, you have been our comrades in arms, and engaged in dealing with the conclusions of the Chinese Revolution. China cannot complete its independence and autonomy without experiencing this kind of suffering. Chinese youth cannot hope to take shortcuts easily. The Greater East Asia War in progress is a war that takes blood as the price and realizes nationalism in our democracy. China has made great contributions with its 5,000 years of culture. What is this high Chinese culture itself? We should reflect on it. It is definitely not a formal return to the classics. We must restore China.</p>
<p>Confucius, Mencius, Lao Tzu, and Zhuangzi</p>
<p>The great spirit led by them. Seventy-five years ago, Japan completed the Meiji Restoration, which was a reflection of the classical spirit of Japan. China is now cooperating with "the peoples of Greater East Asia" in a friendly manner, and its purpose is to restore China's original classical spirit to national consciousness. The construction carried out by China in the past was not "Chinese China", but "Greater East Asian China" or "Chinese Greater East Asia". At nine o'clock, scholars, thinkers, especially monks and laymen who are related to Buddhism, should discuss with each other, and at the same time, we are willing to have those who are related to Christianity discuss this issue from a religious standpoint, so that they can conduct concrete research on the "knowing Japan" and "knowing China" movements, the Pan-Asian thought, and the new cultural order of the Co-prosperity Sphere. The above is just a brief description of my thoughts. I would like to ask you for your advice.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Shanghai Civil Air Defense Further Established; Japanese Air Defense Command Announces Results <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The city's air defense training ended on the 29th and 30th. Regarding the results of this training, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command announced the following on the 31st: This civil air defense training was conducted continuously on the 29th and 30th. Although the citizens were in bad weather, they worked hard and enthusiastically throughout the training, making Shanghai civil air defense more established. It is a great pleasure.</p>
<p>However, as the training items gradually became more advanced, the defects also increased accordingly. Judging from the training results this time, it can be seen that Shanghai's air defense is still far from perfect. In particular, although the various civil guidance agencies and those engaged in training have worked hard, there are still many people who watch and look around as if they were watching a play, which is regrettable. In terms of light control, the results are the worst compared to the previous training sessions. In the future, houses with poor light control will be thoroughly strengthened. It was found that some of the usual control regulations were revised last time, causing the general public to mistakenly believe that light control has been eased. In fact, the last revision was for usual control. In addition, warning control and air raid control are still as strict as before and will never be eased. I hope citizens will not misunderstand.</p>
<p>Training Items</p>
<p>The various training items are described as follows: Evacuation training: (A) After the air raid alarm is issued, the evacuation actions are generally good. However, there is still a need to speed up slightly. (C) Many citizens still sit leisurely in trams and cars without getting off and evacuating to appropriate places. Thorough implementation of various light control methods. This item is the worst compared to previous training sessions. In particular, there are still many light leaks in skylights and other places. In addition, major company offices and other places have light leaks due to the negligence of duty officers. In the future, these poorly controlled houses will be severely punished, and their guidance will be thoroughly strengthened.</p>
<p>(A) The distinction between usual control, warning control, and air raid control, and the transfer of each control, has not been fully implemented. It is hoped that citizens will fully study the types of these three controls and clearly recognize them. In particular, on the morning of the 29th, the warning control was implemented, and after the air raid alarm was lifted on the night of the 30th, the warning control until the end of the training was the worst. Usual control only requires obscuring with curtains, while air raid control and warning control cannot be so simple. The distinction between these points should be fully recognized.</p>
<p>(B) During warning control and air raid control, the gaps in the black curtains leaked light. In the future, the edges of the black curtains should be tightly covered.</p>
<p>(C) The control of the sides and backs of high-rise buildings and the skylights of general houses is still poor and should be provided with sufficient shading equipment.</p>
<p>(D) Some people do not take light reduction measures, but only turn off the lights, hoping to get by for a while. Therefore, each defense group should thoroughly crack down on this.</p>
<p>(E) Flashlights should also be properly dimmed.</p>
<p>(F) Recently, the control of the headlights of cars has been very poor. For example, the shading paint has peeled off and should be repainted. In the future, inspections should be carried out at any time, and those with poor control should be thoroughly cracked down on. Traffic control is generally good. However, the following points should be noted:</p>
<p>(A) After an air raid alarm is issued, those who have no urgent business should not go out. However, there are actually many people walking around. In the future, everyone should stay in their own area and wait for orders.</p>
<p>(B) Under warning control and air raid control, cars that do not comply with traffic rules and have not been authorized drive arbitrarily during the air raid alarm period. During the air raid alarm period, all cars are not allowed to drive, except for "military and public use" and those holding a "non-emergency" vehicle special pass. In the future, if this happens again, the driver's license will be revoked. Work and rescue training are generally good. However, the following points need to be considered: (A) The first priority of work training is to quickly discover the damaged places, so the communication between the work team and the Yinbu should be sufficient. (B) Regarding rescue training, all citizens should be familiar with the necessary hemostasis methods, because whether proper hemostasis can be performed before being sent to the hospital is of great importance to the life of the injured. Various emergency communication links and alarm transmission methods are generally good and can achieve the expected purpose. However, the communication methods for notifying the situation of being bombed in large buildings are not yet appropriate. The person in charge must quickly study and adopt communication methods such as "whistle" signals and "hand" signals. In addition, the civil guidance agencies must quickly sort out the communication materials. To sum up, it can be seen that there are still many aspects of air defense that need to be studied and improved. The training matters that need to be carried out in each area have been notified separately for research, so as to establish a civil air defense capability that is integrated between China and foreign countries. In addition, I would like to express my regret for those who were injured in accidents during this training, and I hope that the general public will pay more attention to preventing accidents in the future. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the various guidance agencies and those who are engaged in training for their active efforts under bad conditions.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Provisional Measures for Food Rice Management in Shanghai Municipality Promulgated; Other Detailed Rules Still Under Discussion <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," which has been deemed essential, was officially promulgated by the Executive Yuan on the 24th of this month. The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, after consultation with the Rice and Grain Control Committee, drafted the "Provisional Measures for Food Rice Management in Shanghai Municipality," consisting of fourteen articles, and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The original text is now published as follows:</p>
<p>These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 4 of the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai."</p>
<p>For the purpose of implementing these measures, the Municipal Government shall order the registered rice shops to establish procurement groups in each administrative district, with one group leader per group, to be designated by the rice rationing agency.</p>
<p>According to the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai," all rice merchants procuring rice through the Rice Control Committee, rice shops registered with the Municipal Government, and nearby farmers who intend to transport their harvested rice into the urban area for sale must apply for a rice transportation passport. (Applicants who have signed contracts should attach a copy of the contract for review.)</p>
<p>The Rice Control Committee shall, on the day of issuing the passport, record a copy of the date, location, and quantity stated on the passport and submit it to the Municipal Government for verification.</p>
<p>Rice storage warehouses shall be designated by the Municipal Government. In principle, all rice transported into the urban area by procurement merchants shall be stored in warehouses designated by the Municipal Government. After the government purchase, it shall be sold to registered rice shops. Nearby farmers shall sell the rice they transport in to rice shops registered with the Municipal Government.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee shall send personnel to be stationed in the designated warehouses to jointly handle the weighing and quality inspection of rice when it is moved from the transport boats into the warehouses.</p>
<p>The rice purchased by registered rice shops must be sold according to the rationing standards, and the procedures shall continue to be handled in accordance with the record-keeping method.</p>
<p>If the quantity of rice purchased by each rice shop is insufficient to meet the needs of its designated rationing area, the shops shall communicate with each other under the supervision of the Municipal Government to ensure that the rationing process is not affected.</p>
<p>The purchase price shall be paid according to the market price, except for rice purchased by the Rice Control Committee, which shall be calculated separately. (The market price shall be determined and announced jointly by the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee on a daily basis.)</p>
<p>The rationing price shall be appropriately lower than the purchase price in the preceding article and shall be stipulated separately. The losses shall be adjusted by the Rice Control Committee.</p>
<p>All rice transported into the city must be transported through the designated entry points for the purpose of statistics and distribution. (The management measures for the entry points will be formulated separately.) Rice transported in through non-designated entry points shall be treated as privately owned rice and shall be subject to punishment.</p>
<p>If any rice shop or procurement merchant engages in hoarding or smuggling, they shall be punished in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations upon discovery.</p>
<p>In principle, the funds required for purchasing rice shall be prepared by the procurement merchants and rice shops themselves.</p>
<p>These measures shall be reviewed by the Rice Control Committee and the Municipal Government and then approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation. According to the aforementioned provisional measures, they are based on Article 4 of the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai." As for the detailed rules, they are being discussed and drafted by the responsible parties of the Municipal Government's Rice Control Committee in consultation with other relevant parties. These rules will include specific regulations on rice types, entry points for transportation, locations for issuing passports, purchase prices, purchase prices in various regions, dates for issuing rationing permits, and future rationing policies. They are expected to be finalized and implemented soon. It is hoped that rice merchants will fully understand the authorities' measures and cooperate with the government as much as possible to improve the rice procurement and transportation methods and ensure an adequate supply of food rice. This is a matter of vital importance to the entire livelihood of the city, and all parties should work together to assist in this endeavor. The authorities will strictly punish, in accordance with the central government's laws and regulations, any unscrupulous elements among the rice merchants who engage in hoarding or transporting private rice for exorbitant profits, and will not be lenient.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Five Organizations Including the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Recommend Improving Grain Administration and Wire a Report to Deputy Director Zhou of the Executive Yuan <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Citizens' Welfare Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, the Money Dealers' Association, and the News Association, in view of the serious poverty situation in this city's rice and grain problem, jointly wired a report to Deputy Director Zhou of the Executive Yuan on May 18, presenting several points of difficulty for grain administration reform. The Living Necessities Subcommittee of the Municipal Political Consultation Committee also made a similar suggestion to the mayor. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan promulgated the "Outline of Temporary Measures for Food Rice for the Citizens of Beijing and Shanghai" on May 24. The wire sent by the Citizens' Welfare Association and other five organizations to the Executive Yuan is copied below:</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Respectfully reported, currently when farmers are planting and preparing stable crops, rice prices in various places continue to rise sharply, and the future of people's food is extremely serious. The association and others all believe that it is appropriate to discuss both temporary and long-term measures. It is necessary to immediately improve the rice and grain control measures. I respectfully suggest the following based on limited views: To take into account farmers' costs and facilitate procurement work, it is necessary to reasonably increase the price of rice and grain purchased. The internal members and staff of the Rice Control Committee should be adjusted to appoint suitable talent to ensure a holistic view. The authority to purchase rice and grain should in principle be unified. The Rice Control Committee's offices in various places should be abolished as appropriate, and the responsibility for procurement work should be assigned to the local county governments to assist in the process. Procurement merchants in various places who are unable to fulfill their duties should have their contracts terminated promptly. Contact transportation agencies with vigor to assist in the Rice Control Committee's efforts to clear rice and grain. Issue a general order to all relevant agencies to strictly prohibit extortion and obstruction of incoming grain. Secondly, in recent weeks, rice prices in Shanghai have risen dramatically, more severely than in other cities and inland areas. If there are no emergency measures, prices will continue to rise, causing public panic and further hardship for the people. As a temporary expedient, without hindering the Rice Control Committee's original plan to purchase grain, obtain the cooperation of the Rice Control Committee and secretly request special permission to establish a Shanghai Rice Bureau to manage rice and grain for the purpose of rationing to households. On the one hand, it is proposed to promptly promulgate measures to reward increased rice and grain production and to protect farmers' costs and profits in order to reassure farmers and achieve practical results in increasing production in timely and concentrated ways. I respectfully request your review and implementation. I am eagerly awaiting your instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth Begins Sale Today; Purchase Certificates Distributed to Households in Each District <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the temporary rationing of cotton cloth in this city, the Chamber of Commerce has submitted a plan to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. All implementation measures have been carefully considered by the Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Government. The silk merchants have decided that all processing procedures have been prepared, and sales will begin on June 1st and end on November 30th of this year. Purchases can be made at any time during this valid period, as there is sufficient stock, so there is no need to rush or compete. At the same time, in order to make the purchase procedures clear to the public, the "Measures for Cloth Merchants Undertaking Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth," "Municipal Silk Merchants' Address Numbers," and "Retail Prices for Temporary Rationing of Cotton Cloth" have been temporarily published separately and distributed with the China Daily on June 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e34">First District Rationing Certificates Can Be Picked Up Starting Today <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The cotton cloth rationing certificates that the citizens of the first district of this city have been eagerly awaiting are now scheduled to be issued starting today by the offices for rationing certificates in each district of the first district public office. All Chinese citizens and Indian nationals in the district can have their household head or their representative, according to the date indicated on the back of the spring housing tax ticket for this year, bring the tax ticket to the certificate office in their jurisdiction to collect the certificate. The validity period of the rationing certificate will be announced separately by the office. If the housing tax ticket is lost, it should be reported immediately to the rationing certificate office in its jurisdiction for verification. However, lost rationing certificates will not be reissued. Taxpaying residents who cannot present a spring housing tax ticket or have doubts about the certificate collection date can visit the rationing certificate office in their jurisdiction in person from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day.

<h3 id="e36">Hoping School Colleagues Cooperate in Requesting Donations from Readers <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The application procedures for the seventh session of the reader scholarship of this newspaper start today. In order to improve service efficiency, this newspaper has specially set up a reader scholarship office to be responsible for handling the scholarship. The application and selection methods are detailed in the reader scholarship news column of this newspaper on May 30th. The application and selection methods for this session have been slightly changed from previous sessions. The main change is that in previous sessions, the newspaper directly handled the application and selection, but in this session, the schools where the students are studying will be responsible for registration and preliminary review. Therefore, the principals and teachers of the schools where the applying students are studying will have more work to do and will spend more time and energy. Standing from the position of supporting the poor and cultivating talents, we believe that all school colleagues will be able to fulfill their responsibility to care for the excellent and poor students of their schools and fully cooperate with the reader scholarship office of this newspaper. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all school colleagues in advance.</p>
<p>Secondly, the current sharp rise in prices is an undeniable fact. The amount of scholarship funds used in this session will be even greater than in the previous session, and we are even more willing to expand the scope of students receiving assistance. Therefore, the ideal is to raise 10 million yuan, but the current accumulated amount is less than a quarter of that. I would like to appeal to all those who have given in the past to continue to do their best to donate, so that those who seek to earn a living can continue to receive assistance, and new students can be promoted to higher education. Small efforts add up, and a small number of large sums are all welcome. May all readers contribute to its success.</p>

The audience reached an unprecedented record of over 30,000 people. Dr. Yan Huiqing performed the kickoff ceremony. The result ended in a 1-1 draw. After taking photos, the match began. Tianjin kicked off. Tianjin United's goalkeeper's ball blocking skills were excellent. Both sides engaged in a tug-of-war. Twenty-five minutes into the game, Shanghai United was too careless and was counterattacked by Tianjin United, who scored a goal. In the second half, Shanghai United replaced Bao Jie with Han Longhai and moved Zhang Lin to defense. Portuguese player Oliveira replaced Zhang. After this adjustment, Shanghai United launched a major offensive, and Li Yao and Huang Mao cooperated to score a goal, resulting in a draw. Although Shanghai United's offensive was strong, Tianjin United relied on its goalkeeper's amazing artistry to turn danger into safety. Sun Jin was penalized twice with a penalty kick, but both were saved.</p>
<p>Yesterday's broadcast time was 6:40 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Value of Disease Prevention and Treatment <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yen Fu-ch'ing</p>
<p>Every summer, epidemics are prevalent, especially cholera, sunstroke, dysentery, diarrhea, and so on. Moreover, the climate is hot and favorable to the activity of insects, and mosquitoes, flies, fleas, and lice are rampant, so the diseases transmitted by these insects also increase, such as malaria, typhus, and so on. At this extraordinary time, all kinds of living needs are difficult to meet, many people live in one house, the location is narrow, the air is polluted, and the diet is simple and insufficient in nutrition, which greatly affects our resistance. Therefore, the prevalence of summer diseases this summer is to be expected. In view of this, the health authorities of this city launched a summer health campaign, which will be held for a week from June 1st to 7th. The purpose is to arouse the public's attention to summer health. In addition to holding a health exhibition, this health campaign also includes broadcasting lectures to instill public health knowledge, and in order to implement health policies, there are also cleanliness campaigns and mosquito and fly eradication campaigns.</p>
<p>The general public mostly believes that the task of doctors is to treat diseases. We only seek medical treatment after we get sick, and we have no other requirements for doctors. This view is wrong. It must be known that the entire medical cause includes three major parts: treatment, prevention, and health care. Prevention and health care are even more important than treatment, because going to a doctor after getting sick often costs a lot of money and may not have good results. If you can hire a doctor as a consultant on weekdays to guide you on how to prevent and maintain your health, then you will spend less and benefit more. According to an estimate by a famous medical scientist, if one yuan is used for treatment, the effect is only worth two corners, if it is used for prevention, the benefit is worth three corners, and if it is used for health care, the benefit is at least five corners. In terms of the degree of progress in modern medicine, there are few diseases that can be diagnosed accurately and have effective treatments, but most can be prevented. Here, I will give three examples of typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, and diphtheria as follows:</p>
<p>Typhoid fever There is no effective treatment for typhoid fever in the beginning. Many patients often die, and even if they are lucky enough to recover, they have been bedridden for months, and the cost of seeing a doctor and taking medicine is not cheap. However, if you get vaccinated on weekdays, you can guarantee that you will not be infected with this disease within two years.</p>
<p>Pulmonary tuberculosis Pulmonary tuberculosis is the most widely transmitted disease. According to recent statistics, 90% of the world's people are infected with pulmonary tuberculosis, and 27-30% of children under the age of 15 are infected with this disease, but in those with strong resistance, the bacteria are latent and will not break out. Once the physical strength is weak and the resistance is reduced, they can be revealed. Therefore, those infected with pulmonary tuberculosis must pay attention to hygiene, rest, breathe fresh air, and eat nutritious food to increase their ability to resist disease and prevent the disease from breaking out. If pulmonary tuberculosis has developed, then there is only rest, recuperation, and attention to nutrition. Other methods only have an auxiliary effect, and they must be carried out in the early stage to have the hope of recovery. If the disease has entered the late stage, then even if a lot of money is spent, it will be ineffective.</p>
<p>Diphtheria Before the invention of serum therapy for diphtheria, most patients did not survive, and the disease was acute and fierce. They often died within a few hours or a day or two after contracting the disease. Now, not only is there an effective treatment, but it can also be prevented. In addition, it can also diagnose whether individuals have the ability to resist diphtheria. If it is found that someone does not have the ability to resist this disease, methods can be taken to increase their resistance and prevent them from being infected. If unfortunately infected, blood therapy can be used to heal it, but treatment that is too late is often ineffective, and even if it is cured and the poison enters the brain, it can cause paralysis. Therefore, even diphtheria therapy, which can be said to be the most reliable, must be treated as early as possible to be effective, and prevention is the best policy.</p>
<p>There is a cleanliness campaign in this health campaign, so I will discuss the main points of cleanliness. American hygienist Rosenau once said that if everyone can pay attention to cleanliness, human diseases can be reduced by half. Cleanliness includes personal cleanliness, clothing cleanliness, food cleanliness, public places cleanliness, etc., especially family cleanliness is the most important, because it has the greatest impact on our health. If everyone can wash their hands before meals, they can reduce the transmission of many diseases.</p>
<p>Cleanliness can be divided into two types: tangible and intangible. In the alley, garbage is piled up, and filth is everywhere. Everyone can see it, and everyone knows that it is unclean. This is tangible uncleanliness. However, there is also uncleanliness that cannot be seen with the naked eye. It looks clean, but in fact it is most harmful to human health because it is not noticed and kills people without them knowing it. From a health point of view, cleanliness can be divided into two categories: surface cleanliness and actual cleanliness. In other words, the standard of cleanliness lies in the presence or absence of germs, not in the appearance. Whether the surface is clean or not can be seen with the naked eye, but whether the actual cleanliness is or not can only be observed under a microscope.</p>
<p>There are many types of summer diseases, mainly cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever. These diseases are mostly caused by unclean food and drink. From a health point of view, these diseases are the most filthy of all diseases. Because the germs are contained in the patient's feces, and after flies bite, their claws carry feces. Then they fly to food or tableware and land on it, leaving the excrement on it. If we eat this food or use this tableware to hold things, we will be in danger of contracting the disease. Although this method of transmission can still be seen and thought of by us, so it can be prevented, but the invisible method of transmission is not paid attention to and is not prevented, so it is the most severe. For example, if a well is located next to a vegetable garden or a toilet, after rain, the water flows into the well, and because it has been filtered through the soil, it looks quite clear, but in fact it contains countless bacteria. If we drink this well water or use it to wash utensils, we will be in danger of contracting the disease. However, if it is boiled or disinfected, it can be drunk with peace of mind. There are many disinfection methods, and the simplest and most effective one is to add one part of bleaching powder to one million parts of water to disinfect and kill bacteria.</p>
<p>To prevent the transmission and prevalence of summer diseases, we must pay attention to cleanliness, as mentioned above. In addition, vaccination is also important. I often see people who are unwilling to get vaccinated because they cannot bear the pain of the reaction, but if they think of the pain of moaning in bed after getting sick, or even the risk of death, then the mere reaction is not worth mentioning.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Message to the Citizens for the Summer Health Campaign <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Fellow citizens! Today is the opening day of the Health Movement Conference. When the word "health" is mentioned, everyone who has been educated can probably understand it, and everyone knows that it is important; however, what is the current state of health in our country? What is the health level of the people? According to experts' estimates, the mortality rate in our country is about 30 per thousand, which is twice as high as in European and American countries. The annual number of deaths is about 12 million, of which at least half die prematurely because they do not know "health." May I ask, how much does the country and individuals lose?</p>
<p>Some people think that "health" is a luxury and should only be enjoyed by the rich. In this year of not having enough to eat or wear, how can the poor do it? In fact, the poor are often faced with unsanitary living conditions due to economic constraints. Therefore, those who have property should pay even more attention to health. Moreover, there are many health practices that do not necessarily require money, such as having a certain regularity in all aspects of eating, drinking, and living, practicing all sanitary habits, and regularizing life, all of which are easy to do without spending money.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens! The above-mentioned regularization of life is only personal hygiene. Further, it should be extended to public hygiene. Promoting public hygiene should start from hygiene morality. Although promoting public hygiene is based on personal hygiene, there are still many citizens who only care about themselves and do not care about public morality. They pay attention to hygiene on their own bodies, but they can ignore it in their families, or they pay attention to cleanliness in their families, but they do not care about public environmental hygiene. They arbitrarily pour garbage, feces, and sewage in their homes on the roads, which hinders public hygiene. This kind of behavior is too childish. As a result, it not only hinders others, but also harms themselves, because the occurrence of infectious diseases is caused by many filth and garbage. Especially in summer, the countless bacteria contained in these garbage multiply quickly after the sun evaporates them. After being transmitted by mosquitoes and flies, infectious diseases are naturally easy to occur. For example, once cholera occurs, it spreads very quickly. Once one person gets sick, it can immediately spread to neighbors and even a village, a county, or a group.</p>
<p>The purpose of the health movement is to promote citizens' attention to public health, thereby reducing diseases, so that every citizen has a healthy body, increases their lifespan, and goes on to do great things for a prosperous country and a strong people.</p>
