<p>代論</p>
<h3>我的重慶政權觀（中）</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>問：你的想法不有點太理想麼？你的本意是想站在客觀立塲上觀察中國問題，但無意中又加上了希望的成份，是吧？</p>
<p>答：決不，我作這樣觀察的論據，並不限於此。而國粹派認爲歐洲問題解決後，蘇聯必定在亞洲追求政治上的發言權，同時將來蘇聯的壓力，向亞洲逐漸增强。甚至現在，他們老早就深深感覺到延安政權的軍事和政治之兩種壓力，那末他們便不得不更加憂慮，假如蘇聯擺脫德國的壓迫後，而對中國問題特別感覺興味，則結果將如何？他們淸晰地知道，爲預防那樣結果，單純重慶是無能爲力的。但他們也知道，美國在中國北部，並沒有與蘇聯競爭的意圖。聯想到這一點時，重慶豈不是愈益不得不與面前擁有武力的日本進行妥協麼？重慶並非自始至終就排斥日本武力本身的，而只是排斥日本武力向中國伸張這一點。</p>
<p>問：然而重慶不是在要求日本即時撤兵麽答自然，中國的民族主義正當洶湧澎湃的今天，重慶政權豐能在原則上允許外國，即時由中國所有角落撤退，則補塡該處所發生的政治和軍事眞空者，是重慶政權？抑是延安政權？按現狀來說，上海當然不必說，就是中國北部也恐怕都將由延安政權來接替。重慶政權洞若觀火地知道，對於中國人施行政治，則延安政權遠勝日本萬倍，且中國共產黨全是出類拔萃的卓越政治家，所以中國北部一經中國共產黨統治後，則決不會再歸重慶所有了。職是之故，日本縱然撤兵，重慶也希望日本先與重慶「商量」好再施行。在這一點上，重慶自然有充分理由願意與日本妥協。</p>
<p>問：你談重慶國粹派的對日政策時，不知不覺便說成重慶政權的對日政繁了。國粹派旣然這樣熱烈希望對日妥協，那末爲什麼一直到今天尚不與日本談判和平呢？</p>
<p>答；國粹派並不像延安政權所宜傳，是想和日本無條件妥協的。最低限度，是在等待蔣介石在「中國之命運」一書中所主張的中華民族之生命綫能有保障的時機。這種國粹派的意向，是有理由同時當作蔣介石意向的。所以我講國粹派的對日政策時，不知不覺便講作重慶政權的對日政策。（此處所說的國粹派，主要是指延安所稱之「反共三位一體」而言，即何應欽的黃浦系，張羣的政學系，陳立夫的CC團。）</p>
<p>問:假如蔣介石現在壽終正寢，你以爲他的繼承人是誰？是由親英美派的人出任？抑還是由國粹派的人出任？</p>
<p>答：按現在的形勢來判斷，我認爲蔣介石的繼承人一定是由國粹派中人來担任。或許就是何應欽。我認爲有三個理由是他：　目前仍然在繼統抗戰，自然重慶的領袖，則以軍人爲最適當。軍人中資格最老者。爲馮玉祥，何應欽，白崇禧，李宗仁，至於陳誠，胡宗南，張發奎等，是比前者低一級的。按軍人的能力說，其名次就是白崇禧，馮玉祥，何應欽，李宗仁。然而白崇禧馮玉祥李宗仁輩，全非蔣介石的嫡系，且他們都會反蔣過一兩次。與此相反，何應欽却是蔣介石嫡系軍人中的頭號元老，且會始終一貫地協助過蔣介石。固然，何應欽在戰略戰術上遠不及白崇禧，在籠絡軍心上決非馮玉祥之敵，然而在人緣方面，却具有不使人討厭的美德。陳誠和胡宗南輩雖無資望，但充蔣介石的繼承人却是最恰當的。　假如何應欽搖身一變而成爲蔣介石的繼承人，則政學系和CC團全都不會丟失前此各自的地盤的，旣然與蔣介石時代同樣能維持住自己的勢力，所以政黨兩方全都擁護他的。　何應欽成爲蔣介石的繼承人後，中央與地方間的關係，也不至於惡化。因爲何應欽與主要省份的實力派全有密切關係。例如四川省的張羣，在思想傾向上是二而一的，是知日派的同志。貴州省的吳　昌，是何的親戚。雲南省的龍雲，是說一不二的至友，當蔣與龍間不能協調時，居間調停者，就是何應欽。此外陝西省的熊斌，福建省的劉建緒，甘肅省的谷正倫，浙江省的黃紹茲，湖南省的薜岳等，全與何保持着良好的關係。</p>
<p>問：現在孔祥熙與「反共三位一體」有什麽關係？</p>
<p>答：孔祥熙可以算在親英美派裹，但這只是按宋家的關係上如此說而已。在思想上却是與蔣介石一樣，與其穩作親英美派，倒勿寗稱他是國粹派。近來的行動尤共如此。他和宋子文往往因財政部長的位置，而鬧得面紅耳赤。重慶政權中有當財政部長資格者，非孔即宋。所以孔得意的時候，即宋失意的時候，宋得意的時候，即孔失意的時侯。現在孔任財政部長外，尚兼行政院副院長。站在孔的立塲上，當然就要防備宋搶他的位置。孔還有一個敵人，即中國共產黨。中國共產黨常痛快淋漓地抨擊孔祥熙爲貪官污吏·孔爲排擠官敵的宋子文，爲反對政敵的中國共產黨，則必然拼命尋求有勢力的後台。於是，孔便與「反共三位一體」相結合了。因爲「反共三位一體」也與親英美派相競爭，也與中國共產黨相衡突。由於這種關係，孔祥熙最近竟脫離親英美派，而與國粹派相接近了。</p>
<p>更正：昨日代論末第九行括弧中「加上侵略主義的日本」，「加上」係「沒有」之誤，特此更正。</p>
<h3>借款强化中儲券　對日圓比率不變　周代院長返國後發表</h3>
<p>中央社訊　國民政府行政院代院長兼財政部長周佛海氏，自八月二十二日赴日勾留遠一旬之久，其間除完成四億元之大借款外，並會親省主席病狀，及與盟邦朝野交換意見頗多。周氏茲已公畢，於日前乘機離日返國抵滬，中央社記者，以局氏此行任務重大，特於日昨往訪周氏於官邸，即詢訪日經過，與主席病况，並及關於最近上海方面所傳中儲券對日圓之比率問題，承周氏就記者所問各點，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>余此次訪日爲非公式的，亦無特殊任務，其目的僅在問候主席病狀，及個人檢查病後身體，稍事休養。主席病狀已日有起色，天凉後恢復或更速也。此次赴日，正值日新閣成立之後，故乘機分別訪問新舊負責當局，及其他朝野要人交換意見。各要人多係舊識，故均能相互暢所欲言，大抵均確實表示中日關係，決不致因新閣成立而有所變更，旣定政策今後當切實加以執行。至決戰熊勢下，日本官民之刻苦努力，實可令人敬服也。關於中儲券對日圓之比率，上海謠傳將有變更者，余負責聲明決無此事，堅持旣定比率，爲國民政府之政策，亦爲日本政府之政策。此次晤小磯首相，及石渡重光兩大臣，便中談及此事，亦均表示日政府對旣定比率，亦主堅持不變。此次日銀對中儲之四億日圓借款，即爲强化中儲券，並堅定其對日圓比率之一證也云云。又悉周氏以滬上要公待理，尚須稍事勾留，再行返京云。</p>

<h3>德派大批預備兵　防禦巴爾幹內綫　保境德駐軍已開始撤退</h3>
<p>瑞典京城三十一旦中央社電由於蘇聯對巴爾幹攻勢之急趨進展，蘇聯與英。美問之關係，亦愈趨微妙。據安加拉消息，關於反軸心國處理保加利亞問題，彼此間麼擦，尤爲尖銳化，保加利亞在蘇聯之支持與諒解下，力圖避免自國化爲戰塲，然英·美則恐　蘇聯要求於希臘登陸成功時，得通過保加利亞領土。另一方面，英·美亦憂慮斯拉夫同盟伸張至東地中海，更畏懼德國，保加利亞，羅馬尼亞國境問題爲蘇聯意圖所左右。德國對於反軸心方面此種妙微之對立關係，乃積極强化洪牙利，斯洛伐古防務，形成巴爾幹內錢防禦綫，現德軍親衛隊精銳，業已通過奧地利，陸續開抵斯洛伐克，對於洪牙利亦由奧地利方面增派大批預備兵。季台爾將軍幷派遣若干師團擔任防衛巴爾幹之重大任務，傳德外長里賓特羅甫及洛　慈中將等要人已抵達布達佩斯，與洪牙利政府舉行協議，聞季台爾將軍最近亦決定訪問布達佩斯，故今後巴爾幹戰局，以保衡斯洛伐克，洪牙利爲中心之動向，愈漸濃厚。</p>
<p>沮利希三十一日中央社電據索菲亞電，駐屯保加利亞之德軍，已開始撤退，數日間即將竣事</p>
<p>里斯本三十一日中央社電據索菲亞消息，駐希職與捷克之保加利亞軍，已奉本國訓令，自佔領地向本國撤退。</p>
<h3>法北德軍　探彈性戰術</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電海通社訊，反軸心軍企圖包抄法國西北部之德軍，德軍採取彈性與流動之戰術，且以坦克車隊在斯特傑爾附近製擊敵軍，美國第二軍右翼頗感威脅，美軍第一軍自巴黎向奧爾克推進，到達馬納河與陶斯納河之間。巴頓將軍之部隊，自南面壓迫馬納河中部，頗爲得手，德軍依照彈性防禦之原則，殊無固守馬納河中部之必要，美軍先鋒已抵索伊遜東北之達姆斯，其左翼頗感威脅，因西面之反軸心軍頗爲落後也。奧斯河與海峽沿岸之間，戰况益趨激烈，塞納河北岸，反軸心軍橋頭堡均已增援，並已取得聯絡，且向北面進展，德軍北退數公里，扼守新陣地，盧昂亦已放棄矣，英加軍在西南增加壓力，顯欲牽掣德軍，藉以呼應美軍之包抄活動。</p>
<h3>孫軍戰備　大規模攻勢</h3>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電　東歐戰綫除羅馬尼亞及洪牙利國境戰綫外，均呈安定狀態，然此非蘇軍進攻力量不足之謂，德軍當局亦知，蘇軍刻正利用目下之安定，從事努力於兵力之改編與基地之整備，故不久全綫之大規模總攻勢必將開始。</p>
<p>柏林三十一日中央社電德國社訊：蘇軍昨企圖由華沙之東北發動突破攻勢，以期達到佔領之目的，但未獲逞，且損失坦克車二十四輛。</p>

<p>蕪湖原為產米及小麥區，米價難現在已大漲特漲，一號機米三千三四百元，二號米三千一二百元，毛熟米三千元，仍不及滬地之半。綠牌麵粉每包一千二百五十元，紅牌一千二百元。但”常生活，反較上海爲高。因比年以來，利用江南北物資不正常流通關係，一般長袖善舞以致暴發者頗不乏人。而一般外來之生活必須品，則價格狂漲，蓋運　稍有阻滯，不法商人即乘機囤楨暴利所得，盡情享樂，因此旅館菜館構成畸形繁榮。</p>
<p>正值割稻之季，記者迭次與農民懇談，得悉該兩地本年收成大多良好，復聞附近米穀各來源地，本年產量預計亦可較往年增加，則該區收購米糧工作，應可順利進行，但事實前途未敢樂觀，廠結所在不外以下數端：</p>
<h3>運輪欠暢</h3>
<p>蕪湖運米來滬，唯一途徑全持由京無綫轉京滬機最近一再減少車輛，運輸難免益增困難，年前蕪地商會會長李慧龍君（採辦商之一）曾用帆船裝運千餘包來滬，但以沿途困難諸多，兼以船隻異常缺乏，難再續辦。如期該區米糧能不絕運滬，必須運輸上有一根本解決，如要求華鐵儘量撥車或竟大量利用水運，如何蒐集船隻，由海軍保護，未始非補救之這。</p>
<h3>人事問題</h3>
<p>米糧統制機講，以前工作多欠國滑，無可諱言，現己改組，應有刷新的更張。該會當局似應隨時予以注意。如蕪湖區米糧統制會辦事處成立以來，共放出貸款六萬二千八百七十三萬三千八百七十五元五角，乃驗收米數，迄今僅四十一萬四千餘石，「當時收購價係由每石數百元，陸續提高至現在每石三千七百五十元，不能以目前市價爲比例」。此種情形或難免有人互相利用，另作他圖，害公肥己，此後運用貸款及驗收期限，均需嚴格規定，不稍通融。該會上下尤應有正人先正巳之決心，人謀不臧，固應補救，而故使之不臧，則不可恕矣。</p>
<h3>縣長政績</h3>
<p>蕪湖絲長自蔡羹舜接任以來，第一步即用一種化零爲整之方法，向民間征收「行政輔助費」，提高一般公務員待遇，嚴禁所屬向人民無故勒索，故人民多藥稱之。其他地方建設亦多籌劃，果能取之於民，而用之於民，則未可厚非也。</p>
<h3>農村一斑</h3>
<p>田寗人皖，沿綫遠眺，逼地金色，一望無際，正值秋收之時。沿途待割之稻，迎風搖曳，比年以來，皖省收獲均佳，故農民一般生活大都優裕，芷忙着收割打稻之務。當經過汪家村時，乘間與當地農民談及地主佃　之利益分配，據云「收穫實數向按四六分配，「地主四成，佃戶得六成」，而田賦則由地主負擔。鄉間仍有少數散匪流痞，農民爲安全計，有自動組織紅槍會大刀會之舉，聞當局有因勢利導，加以訓練，增强其自衛能力，以補救正規團隊之不足」云云。</p>
<p>蕪湖無論市鎭鄉村，處處顯露股實，手工業亦相當發達，機柕之聲，隨處可聞。當地公益善舉，如養老院，孤兒院，及平民織布廠等，稍有興辦，惜乎教育方面，太覺落後，平民子弟學校，義務學校，殆不多見，偶行街間，令人驚奇者因見有美人閒步街上，態度優閒，會談之下，始悉此君乃蕪湖萃文學校校長華爾登，事變以來，即　邦及我富局優待，生活安適。本地習俗，家有喜事，必休業數日，大事舖張，荒時廢日，莫此爲甚，記者等所住之旅館，相隔二日，價目突加白分之五十，詢之則謂「生活又高了」。快車漲價，划處皆然也</p>

<h3>物品配給處停止登記</h3>
<p>本市物品配給處自九月一日起，停止食米登記，中央社記者昨特訪該處處長馮攸，承發表談話如下：「本處前為明瞭本市存米敷量起見，於八月四日配總字第二號佈吿，規定食米登記辦法，又於八月十七日配總字第十三號佈吿，規定八月五日後購入食米之登記辦法，實施以來，市民依法登記者，殊屬踴躍，截至八月十日止，在本處登記數量，共計為八萬九千四百四十八石，八月十日以後，此項登記及取締事宜，已移轉經濟保安處辦理，其數量及取締情形，當由該處正式發表，查上項食米登記原為臨時措置辦法，茲因辦理理巳有相當日期，現決定於九月一日起停止食米登記，所有八月四日及八月十七日兩佈吿各規定概予廢止。」</p>

<h3>旅館延席捐　稅收增多</h3>
<p>自本市特稅舞弊案為與論揭發，招致各方重視以來，市財政當局亟謀悉力整頓肅淸貨污，增加稅收。最近據記者向有關方面調查，單就旅館筵席捐一項，經旬日之努力，統計較七月實收稅額，約增六百萬元以上。按此項稅收之激增，實可證明過去無弊以致稅收减少之一般。深盼財政當局，能更進一步，鋼除舞弊職屬，更裕稅收。</p>
<h3>華中增產本部　定今日成立</h3>

<h3>諮詢委員會　今七次大會</h3>
<p>上海特別市政府諮詢委員會，頃為商討會務，特定於今（一）日下午舉行第七次大會，屆時陳市長將躬親蒞會主持。共八十九人庭論交保</p>
<h3>大批難糧投機商被捕昨開番公八十九人廷論交保</h3>
<p>本市經濟保安處，於上月間得悉有陸壽良徐育初及干春霖等，俱為中國買易公司職員，自去年十一月間因雜糧公會解散後，陸等遂利用時機，在圓明圓路一六九號協進大樓四百〇三號至四百〇六號該公司房間，以上海調劑民食米麥雜糧商合作營業處名義，徵求會員，收取會費，設立市塲，買賣雜糧，陸壽良負責在外徵集會員，徐育初十春霖負責主持內部，加入會員每月納會費五百元，一千元，二千元不等，由陸出給收據，作為入塲證，五月間以塲地狹小，遷至重慶路三〇號公平本樓作市塲。經濟保安處獲報後，即前往破獲，陸壽良徐育初干春霖聞風在逃，當塲拘獲汪春紡等八十九人，彼等俱營雜糧業，或爲　主，或為跑街，或為獲客，作類似交易所之買賣，經連同證件由經濟保安處移送本市地檢署，經檢察官迭次偵查，對此八十九人依照戰時刑事特別法第十七條，提起公訴，昨晨在地院第一庭由推事沈季寬對該案正式開審，庭上對各被吿詢問籍貫年齡後，即開始審問，各被吿所供幾全相同，略稱因目下並無其他市塲，故而加入該市場作現貨賣買，因被吿人數衆多，故傳詢至一時許，即由庭諭改期再訊，各被吿交舖保或五萬元現金保云。（按戰時刑事特別法第十七條得處死刑無期徒刑併科十萬元以下之罰金。）</p>
<h3>評短　但貴改過</h3>
<p>經濟保安處長五島氏，昨天爲食米登記事發表談話，對於食米登記之成績不佳，尤其智識階級違反者居多，表示遺憾。</p>
<p>對於食米登記一事，自從八月四日市物品配給處佈告以後，我們即於八月八日社評，以「存米登記毋存觀望」為題，詮釋當局舉辦存米登記之目的，絕無强制收買之意，盼望市民遵期登記，以免違反受罰。可是，我們同樣遺憾的一部分市民對於法令意義未盡明瞭。今當局旣能斟酌情形，在可能範圍內，本寬大方針處理。這是値得贊成的。</p>
<p>然而，今後市良應嚴切注意，對於戰時經濟法令，必須信賴常局遵從辦理，切勿以漠不相關的態度對於法令熟視無睹，致千法紀並受處罰。同時，希望當局也以誠信為市民着想，第一，經濟統制的法令條文不能太複雜，致先後不一致而令人無所適從。第二，法令條文之發表，僅賴報紙作公吿傳播，還嫌不够，因有許多市民不閱報紙的。似可通過保田機構傳知各戶，並用無綫電廣播，解釋愈淸楚愈好。而佈吿內容有時間限制者，尤應有適當寬長，俾使市民能充分準備。</p>
<p>最後，希望保安處職員出勤查案，首須對市民應保持和氣態度，並在指定任務以外，不必乘便牽涉，臂如奉命查米，就不必查問別種物品，致使市民發生誤會。</p>

<h3>My View on the Chongqing Regime (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Toyosuke</p>
<p>Q: Aren't your ideas a bit too idealistic? Your intention is to observe the China problem from an objective standpoint, but you've unintentionally added an element of hope, haven't you?</p>
<p>A: Absolutely not. The basis for my observation is not limited to that. The National Essence faction believes that after the European problem is resolved, the Soviet Union will inevitably seek a political voice in Asia, and the pressure from the Soviet Union will gradually increase in Asia. Even now, they deeply feel the dual pressures of the Yan'an regime, both military and political. Therefore, they have to worry even more: if the Soviet Union gets rid of the oppression of Germany and becomes particularly interested in the China problem, what will be the result? They clearly know that Chongqing alone is powerless to prevent such a result. But they also know that the United States has no intention of competing with the Soviet Union in northern China. Considering this, isn't Chongqing increasingly forced to compromise with Japan, which possesses military force right in front of it? Chongqing does not reject Japanese military force itself from beginning to end, but only rejects the expansion of Japanese military force into China.</p>
<p>Q: But isn't Chongqing demanding Japan's immediate withdrawal of troops? Of course, with Chinese nationalism surging today, the Chongqing regime cannot, in principle, allow foreign countries to immediately withdraw from all corners of China. So, who will fill the political and military vacuum that arises there? Is it the Chongqing regime or the Yan'an regime? As it stands, not to mention Shanghai, even northern China will probably be taken over by the Yan'an regime. The Chongqing regime knows perfectly well that the Yan'an regime is ten thousand times better than Japan at governing the Chinese people, and the Chinese Communist Party is full of outstanding and exceptional politicians. Therefore, once northern China is ruled by the Chinese Communist Party, it will never belong to Chongqing again. For this reason, even if Japan withdraws its troops, Chongqing hopes that Japan will "discuss" it with Chongqing first before implementing it. On this point, Chongqing naturally has sufficient reason to be willing to compromise with Japan.</p>
<p>Q: When you talk about the Chongqing National Essence faction's policy towards Japan, you unconsciously refer to it as the Chongqing regime's policy towards Japan. If the National Essence faction so eagerly hopes for a compromise with Japan, then why hasn't it negotiated peace with Japan to this day?</p>
<p>A: The National Essence faction does not want to unconditionally compromise with Japan, as the Yan'an regime propagates. At the very least, they are waiting for the opportunity to guarantee the lifeline of the Chinese nation, as advocated by Chiang Kai-shek in his book "China's Destiny." This intention of the National Essence faction can reasonably be regarded as Chiang Kai-shek's intention at the same time. That's why when I talk about the National Essence faction's policy towards Japan, I unconsciously refer to it as the Chongqing regime's policy towards Japan. (The National Essence faction mentioned here mainly refers to the "anti-communist trinity" referred to by Yan'an, namely He Yingqin's Whampoa Clique, Zhang Qun's Political Science Clique, and Chen Lifu's CC Clique.)</p>
<p>Q: If Chiang Kai-shek were to pass away now, who do you think his successor would be? Would it be someone from the pro-British and American faction, or someone from the National Essence faction?</p>
<p>A: Judging from the current situation, I believe that Chiang Kai-shek's successor will definitely be someone from the National Essence faction. Perhaps it will be He Yingqin. I think there are three reasons for this: Currently, the war of resistance is still being continued. Naturally, the leader of Chongqing should be a military man. Among the military men, the most senior are Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and Li Zongren. As for Chen Cheng, Hu Zongnan, Zhang Fakui, etc., they are one level lower than the former. Judging by the abilities of the military men, their ranking is Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, He Yingqin, and Li Zongren. However, Bai Chongxi, Feng Yuxiang, and Li Zongren are not Chiang Kai-shek's direct subordinates, and they have all rebelled against Chiang once or twice. In contrast, He Yingqin is the most senior veteran among Chiang Kai-shek's direct military subordinates, and he has consistently assisted Chiang Kai-shek. Of course, He Yingqin is far inferior to Bai Chongxi in strategy and tactics, and he is definitely not Feng Yuxiang's match in winning over the military's hearts. However, in terms of interpersonal relationships, he possesses the virtue of not making people dislike him. Although Chen Cheng and Hu Zongnan lack seniority, they are the most suitable successors to Chiang Kai-shek. If He Yingqin suddenly becomes Chiang Kai-shek's successor, the Political Science Clique and the CC Clique will not lose their respective territories. Since they can maintain their own power in the same way as in Chiang Kai-shek's era, both political parties will support him. After He Yingqin becomes Chiang Kai-shek's successor, the relationship between the central government and the local governments will not deteriorate. This is because He Yingqin has close relationships with the powerful figures in major provinces. For example, Zhang Qun of Sichuan Province is two-in-one in terms of ideological inclination and is a comrade of the pro-Japanese faction. Wu Dingchang of Guizhou Province is He's relative. Long Yun of Yunnan Province is an unquestionable close friend. When Chiang and Long could not coordinate, the mediator was He Yingqin. In addition, Xiong Bin of Shaanxi Province, Liu Jianxu of Fujian Province, Gu Zhenglun of Gansu Province, Huang Shaohong of Zhejiang Province, Xue Yue of Hunan Province, etc., all maintain good relations with He.</p>
<p>Q: What is Kong Xiangxi's relationship with the "anti-communist trinity" now?</p>
<p>A: Kong Xiangxi can be counted as part of the pro-British and American faction, but this is only based on the relationship with the Song family. In terms of ideology, he is the same as Chiang Kai-shek. Rather than firmly being a pro-British and American faction member, it is better to say that he is a member of the National Essence faction. His recent actions are especially so. He and Song Ziwen often argue fiercely over the position of Minister of Finance. Among the Chongqing regime, those qualified to be Minister of Finance are either Kong or Song. Therefore, when Kong is successful, Song is frustrated, and when Song is successful, Kong is frustrated. Now, in addition to being Minister of Finance, Kong also serves as Vice President of the Executive Yuan. Standing in Kong's position, he must naturally guard against Song from seizing his position. Kong also has another enemy, namely the Chinese Communist Party. The Chinese Communist Party often vehemently criticizes Kong Xiangxi as a corrupt official. In order to exclude the official enemy Song Ziwen, and to oppose the political enemy the Chinese Communist Party, Kong will inevitably desperately seek a powerful backer. As a result, Kong combined with the "anti-communist trinity." Because the "anti-communist trinity" also competes with the pro-British and American faction and clashes with the Chinese Communist Party. Due to this relationship, Kong Xiangxi has recently broken away from the pro-British and American faction and become closer to the National Essence faction.</p>
<p>Correction: In yesterday's substitute theory, in the ninth line of the parentheses, "plus the aggressive Japan," "plus" is a mistake for "without." This is specially corrected.</p>
<h3>Loan Strengthens Central Reserve Certificates; Exchange Rate with Japanese Yen Remains Unchanged; President Zhou Returns Home and Makes Announcement</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Dispatch: Zhou Fohai, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, has returned to the country and arrived in Shanghai by plane after a long stay in Japan since August 22, lasting more than ten days. During this period, in addition to completing a large loan of 400 million yuan, he also met with the chairman of the province to discuss the condition of his illness, and exchanged opinions with many in the allied nations, both government and public. The Central News Agency reporter, considering the importance of Mr. Zhou's trip, paid a visit to Mr. Zhou at his official residence yesterday to inquire about his visit to Japan, the condition of the chairman's illness, and the recent rumors in Shanghai regarding the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Certificates and the Japanese yen. Mr. Zhou, in response to the reporter's questions, made the following statement:</p>
<p>My visit to Japan this time was unofficial and without any special mission. The purpose was only to inquire about the chairman's illness and to have a personal checkup and rest after my own illness. The chairman's condition has been improving daily, and his recovery may be even faster after the weather cools down. This trip to Japan coincided with the establishment of the new Nikkei cabinet, so I took the opportunity to visit the new and old responsible authorities and other important figures in the government and public to exchange opinions. Most of the important figures were old acquaintances, so we were all able to speak our minds freely. They generally expressed that Sino-Japanese relations would not change due to the establishment of the new cabinet, and the established policies will be earnestly implemented in the future. Under the resolute war situation, the hard work of the Japanese officials and people is truly admirable. Regarding the exchange rate between the Central Reserve Certificates and the Japanese yen, regarding the rumors in Shanghai that there will be changes, I am responsible for declaring that there is no such thing. Adhering to the established exchange rate is the policy of the National Government and the policy of the Japanese government. When I met with Prime Minister Koiso and Ministers Ishiwatari Shigamitsu, we talked about this matter, and they all expressed that the Japanese government also insists on maintaining the unchanged established exchange rate. The loan of 400 million Japanese yen from the Bank of Japan to the Central Reserve Certificates this time is evidence of strengthening the Central Reserve Certificates and confirming its exchange rate with the Japanese yen. It is also said that Mr. Zhou must deal with important public affairs in Shanghai and needs to stay for a while before returning to Nanjing.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Break Out in Hunan and Northern Burma; American Aircraft in the Pacific Attack Truk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The anti-Axis counteroffensive against Japan is intensifying, and at the same time, enemy air force air raids on Japanese Pacific bases are also becoming more frequent. On the Chinese front, the American army in Chongqing is attempting to recapture Weiyang and has launched fierce battles to seize food supplies. In the Nujiang area of northern Burma, battles have also broken out in the past ten days. In Hunan, the Japanese army is securing key points on one hand and continuing to implement planned operations on the other. Around Hengyang, there are about ten divisions of the Chongqing army, claiming to be in fortifications, attempting to recapture Hengyang. The Japanese army is currently actively carrying out a campaign to eliminate these threats. The Japanese air force, in coordination with the ground forces, has carried out nighttime air raids on Guilin and other American air bases in Chongqing, centered on Hengyang. Currently, the Japanese army's campaign to destroy the Chongqing army's bases is gradually intensifying. In Burma, in order to open up the Ledo Road, the Chongqing army has launched fierce air raids on the Nujiang front in northern Burma. The Japanese garrison is responding at any time to counter the attacks and secure key points. The Chongqing army has launched a general counteroffensive on the three fronts of La Meng, Sheng Yue, and Longling. The battle is very fierce. The Japanese army is fiercely resisting the Chongqing army's counteroffensive with a small number of troops and has blunted the enemy's offensive. In the Central Pacific, the fierce battles on the islands of Dieniane and Omiya have lasted for three decades. Currently, the Japanese soldiers are still continuing their fierce battles with isolated forces, defending their strongholds to the death. Enemy air raids on other islands have also gradually intensified in recent days. The Japanese garrison is taking the opportunity to inflict heavy damage on the enemy forces. On the islands of New Guinea and other islands in the South Pacific, enemy aircraft have also been attacking. The enemy aircraft's air raid on Morga Island is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: In the Central Pacific base report, twenty American four-engine aircraft attacked Truk Island on the morning of the 29th. After the Japanese army countered, they were heavily damaged and repelled.</p>
<p>Loamou, 30th, Central News Agency Dispatch: At one o'clock in the morning on the 29th, an enemy large aircraft invaded the airspace over Loamou and blindly bombed near the base. After dropping several bombs, it quickly fled. The port facilities did not suffer any damage. One bomb hit a nearby Filipino's house, killing seven Filipinos and injuring three.</p>
<h3>Central Government Commemorates the Martyrs of Peace and National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The first day of the month is the memorial day for the martyrs of peace, anti-communism, and national reconstruction. The central government will hold a grand memorial service and ceremony for the martyrs of peace and anti-communism at 9:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium. All officials of the central government's various ministries and departments will attend the ceremony at that time. Civil officials will wear national礼服 or blue robes and black jackets and wear勲章. Military officers will wear 重常服 and wear勲章.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Governor-General De Cou Visits Ambassador Arakawa</h3>
<p>Saigon, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Governor-General De Cou visited Ambassador Arakawa at the Japanese Embassy's official residence on the 29th for various talks. This was the first meeting since Governor-General De Cou took full control of Annam. On the evening of the 30th, Ambassador Arakawa held a banquet at the Saigon office of the embassy, ​​inviting important figures from the French side. Ambassador Arakawa and the four consuls-general were present and engaged in various talks.</p>
<h3>Japanese Wing Political Council Holds Intelligence Department Meeting</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Wing Political Council held an intelligence department meeting at its headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 30th. President Kobayashi, Intelligence Minister Kawashima, and others attended the meeting and carefully discussed the countermeasures for the comments and reports of the 85th special meeting. As a result, they prepared four agreed-upon items and hoped that the relevant authorities, such as the Information Bureau, would implement them step by step. At the same time, they requested the cooperation of the news media. The agreed items are as follows: The comments of the members of the parliament represent public opinion and should be fully informed to the people to the extent possible. Regarding the news coverage of parliamentary comments, the authorities' review should make the people understand its true center, in order to uplift the people's original intentions. The content of secret meetings often contains unnecessary information, and from now on, secret meetings should have real meaning.</p>
<h3>Taiwan Implements Military Service System Starting Today</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Taiwan will implement the military service system starting September 1 of this year. Taiwan is the central base for the construction of Greater East Asia, gathering patriotic enthusiasm and using all physical and mental strengths to complete the war.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Surprise Attack on Guilin; Displaying Ingenious Tactics; Also Bombed Liangshan Airfield</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Frontline Base, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese Air Force suddenly attacked Guilin on the night of the 29th, making skillful use of the moment when the American planes in Chongqing landed, destroying 15 of their large and small planes. The situation of the first "Chief Sergeant Yoda Plane" of the Japanese planes fighting fiercely over Guilin is recorded as follows: The chief sergeant was the vanguard of the attack that day, and he eagerly advanced towards his destination, overcoming the adverse weather and arriving over Guilin at the scheduled time. In the midst of the Chongqing planes returning, the sound of Chief Sergeant Yoda's plane mixed with the Chongqing and American planes, causing them to mistake it for a friendly plane landing. Chief Sergeant Yoda immediately dropped a giant bomb on the black spot in the west. When he turned around, the runway was already ablaze with flames. At that time, two large Chongqing and American planes and large planes had already been burned. Next to it were three larger planes and four smaller planes, confirmed to have been destroyed and burned. Therefore, the total result of this battle was 15 planes. The plane returned on its way back that day.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Military Frontline Base, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese bomber fleet blindly bombed the Guilin airfield on the night of the 29th in bad weather. In addition to destroying 21 Chongqing planes at the airfield, it also caused one of its facilities to be hit and exploded.

Previously, in May of this year, the Japanese South China Army returned 375 pieces of enemy property. Together with this return, there are a total of 1,961 pieces.</p>
<h3>Germany Sends Large Batch of Reserve Troops; Defending the Balkan Inner Line; German Troops Stationed in Bulgaria Have Begun to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Due to the rapid progress of the Soviet offensive in the Balkans, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly delicate. According to Angara news, the friction between them regarding the handling of the Bulgarian issue by the anti-Axis countries is particularly acute. Bulgaria, with the support and understanding of the Soviet Union, is trying to avoid turning its country into a battlefield. However, Britain and the United States fear that the Soviet Union will demand passage through Bulgarian territory when it succeeds in landing in Greece. On the other hand, Britain and the United States are also concerned about the expansion of the Slavic alliance to the eastern Mediterranean and are even more afraid that the German, Bulgarian, and Romanian border issues will be swayed by the Soviet Union's intentions. Germany is actively strengthening the defenses of Hungary and Slovakia in response to this subtle opposition on the anti-Axis side, forming an inner line of defense in the Balkans. The elite German SS troops have already passed through Austria and are successively arriving in Slovakia. A large batch of reserve troops is also being sent to Hungary from Austria. General季台尔 has also dispatched several divisions to take on the important task of defending the Balkans. It is reported that German Foreign Minister里宾特罗甫 and Lieutenant General 洛慈 and other important figures have arrived in Budapest to hold talks with the Hungarian government. It is heard that General季台尔 has also recently decided to visit Budapest, so the future of the Balkan war, centered on Slovakia and Hungary, is becoming increasingly intense.</p>
<p>沮利希, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to the Sofia report, the German troops stationed in Bulgaria have begun to withdraw and will be completed within a few days.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: According to Sofia news, the Bulgarian troops stationed in Greece and the Czech Republic have received instructions from their country to withdraw from the occupied territories to their country.</p>
<h3>German Troops in Northern France Explore Elastic Tactics</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: Haitong News Agency reports that the anti-Axis forces are attempting to encircle the German troops in northwestern France. The German troops are adopting elastic and mobile tactics and are using tank teams to attack enemy troops near斯特杰尔. The right wing of the American Second Army feels threatened. The American First Army is advancing from Paris towards奧爾克 and has reached between the馬納河 and the陶斯納河. General 巴顿's troops are pressing the middle of the馬納河 from the south and are quite successful. According to the principle of elastic defense, the German troops have no need to hold the middle of the馬納河 firmly. The American vanguard has reached達姆斯, northeast of索伊遜, and its left wing feels threatened because the anti-Axis forces in the west are quite far behind. The battle between the奧斯河 and the coast is becoming increasingly fierce. On the north bank of the塞納河, the anti-Axis forces' bridgeheads have all been reinforced and have established contact and are advancing northward. The German troops have retreated several kilometers to defend new positions.卢昂 has also been abandoned. The British and Canadian forces are increasing pressure in the southwest, apparently wanting to restrain the German troops in order to respond to the American army's encirclement activities.</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Preparations; Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Eastern European front, with the exception of the battle lines on the borders of Romania and Hungary, is in a stable state. However, this does not mean that the Soviet army's offensive power is insufficient. The German military authorities also know that the Soviet army is currently using the current stability to work hard on the reorganization of its forces and the consolidation of its bases, so a large-scale general offensive on the entire line will inevitably begin soon.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st, Central News Agency Dispatch: German News Agency reports: The Soviet army attempted to launch a breakthrough offensive from the northeast of Warsaw yesterday in order to achieve its goal of occupation, but it did not succeed and lost 24 tanks.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Short Notes; Current Situation in Wuhu</h3>
<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>Wuhu borders the Yangtze River and is also connected by the Beijing-Wuhu and Huainan lines (the Huainan line has been temporarily suspended for half a month), making land and water transportation very convenient and commerce prosperous. According to statistics from August, the population of the urban area has reached 124,422. The reporter stayed here for two days and recorded the following observations:</p>
<h3>Distorted Prosperity</h3>
<p>Wuhu was originally a rice and wheat producing area, and rice prices have now risen sharply. No. 1機米 costs 3,300-3,400 yuan, No. 2 rice costs 3,100-3,200 yuan, and毛熟 rice costs 3,000 yuan, which is still less than half of Shanghai's price. Green brand flour costs 1,250 yuan per bag, and red brand flour costs 1,200 yuan. However, the cost of living is actually higher than in Shanghai. Because in recent years, due to the abnormal flow of materials in Jiangnan, there are quite a few people who are good at manipulating things and have become rich overnight. The prices of essential foreign goods have skyrocketed. If transportation is slightly hindered, unscrupulous merchants will take the opportunity to hoard goods and make exorbitant profits, indulging in pleasure. Therefore, hotels and restaurants have created a distorted prosperity.</p>
<p>It is the season for harvesting rice. The reporter had several in-depth conversations with farmers and learned that the harvest this year is mostly good in both places. It is also heard that the estimated yield of rice from various sources in the vicinity this year may also increase compared to previous years. Therefore, the work of purchasing rice in this area should be able to proceed smoothly, but the future reality is not optimistic. The core problem lies in the following points:</p>
<h3>Transportation Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The only way to transport rice from Wuhu to Shanghai is to transfer it from the Beijing-Wuhu line to the Beijing-Shanghai machine. The number of vehicles on the Beijing-Shanghai machine has recently been repeatedly reduced, which inevitably increases the difficulty of transportation. Before the year, Mr. Li Huilong, the president of the Wuhu Chamber of Commerce (one of the purchasing merchants), once transported more than 1,000 bags to Shanghai by sailing boat, but due to the many difficulties along the way and the extreme shortage of boats, it is difficult to continue. If the supply of rice in the area can continue uninterrupted to Shanghai, there must be a fundamental solution to the transportation problem, such as requiring China Railways to allocate as many cars as possible or even making extensive use of water transportation. How to collect ships and have them protected by the navy may not be a solution to remedy this.</p>
<h3>Personnel Issues</h3>
<p>It is undeniable that the work of the rice control organization has often been lacking in efficiency in the past. Now it has been reorganized and should have a refreshing change. The authorities of the association should pay attention to it at any time. Since the establishment of the Wuhu District Rice Control Association Office, it has issued loans totaling 62,873,387.55 yuan, but the number of rice inspected to date is only more than 414,000 石. "The purchase price at the time was gradually increased from several hundred yuan per 石 to the current 3,750 yuan per 石, and cannot be proportional to the current market price." In such a situation, it is difficult to avoid people taking advantage of each other for other purposes, harming the public and benefiting themselves. In the future, the use of loans and the deadline for inspection must be strictly regulated without any flexibility. The association should also have the determination to be upright people before straightening out others. If the personnel plan is not good, it should be remedied, but it is unforgivable to deliberately make it not good.</p>
<h3>County Chief's Achievements</h3>
<p>Since Cai Gengshun took over as the magistrate of Wuhu, the first step he took was to use a method of turning pieces into wholes to collect "administrative assistance fees" from the people to improve the treatment of general civil servants and strictly prohibit his subordinates from extorting the people without cause, so the people mostly praised him. Many other local construction projects are also being planned. If it can be taken from the people and used for the people, then it cannot be criticized too much.</p>
<h3>A GlimPSE OF THE COUNTRYSIDE</h3>
<p>Fields of grain in Anhui Province spread out along the railway lines as far as the eye could see, a golden expanse, marking the season of autumn harvest.  Uncut rice swayed in the wind along the way.  The harvests in Anhui have been good in recent years, so farmers generally enjoy a relatively comfortable life, busily engaged in reaping and threshing.  While passing through Wangjia Village, I took the opportunity to talk with local farmers about the distribution of profits between landlords and tenants.  They said, "The actual harvest is divided according to a 40/60 split, with the landlord getting 40% and the tenant 60%," and the land tax is borne by the landlord.  There are still a few scattered bandits and vagrants in the countryside. For safety, farmers have spontaneously organized Red Spear Societies and Broadsword Societies.  It is said that the authorities are guiding them according to circumstances, providing training to enhance their self-defense capabilities, supplementing the inadequacies of the regular forces.</p>
<p>Whether in the city of Wuhu, the towns, or the villages, prosperity is evident everywhere. Handicraft industries are also quite developed, and the sound of machinery can be heard everywhere.  Local public welfare undertakings, such as nursing homes, orphanages, and public weaving factories, have been established to some extent.  It is regrettable that education is quite backward.  Schools for ordinary people's children and compulsory schools are rarely seen.  While walking on the street, I was surprised to see a beautiful woman strolling leisurely. After speaking to her, I learned that she was Miss Walden, the principal of the Cuiwen School in Wuhu. Since the incident, she has been well-treated by both the Japanese and our local authorities, and lives comfortably.  Local custom dictates that when there is a happy event in a family, businesses must close for several days, with lavish spending and much time wasted. Nothing is worse than this. The price of the hotel where the reporters were staying suddenly increased by 50% in two days. When asked, they said, "The cost of living has gone up again." The increase in express train fares is also the same everywhere.</p>

<h3>Violation of Rice Registration Will Be Severely Punished: Interview with Mr. Goshima, Director of the Economic Security Office</h3>
<p>The Director of the Economic Security Office, Mr. Goshima, recently issued the following statement: "According to the rice registration implemented by the Goods Distribution Office's proclamation, as of August 31st, the number of registered cases was 695, totaling 93,163.25 *shi* (with 69 cases of incorrect registration, totaling 1,853 *shi*), and the number of unregistered cases was 162, totaling 8,315.54 *shi*. The results are quite unsatisfactory.  It is particularly regrettable that the majority of violations are committed by the intellectual class and related companies and stores.  The purpose of rice registration is to clarify the existing quantity for the implementation of rice countermeasures. It is not for compulsory purchase or confiscation. The authorities have repeatedly clarified and announced this point. Not only do people knowingly violate the regulations, but the number of violations shows a disregard for the authorities' proclamations.  In order to maintain the dignity of the proclamation, this office has decided to punish violators according to regulations.  Rice under seal will be confiscated, except for cases where the amount is open to discussion. Of course, rice is of great importance to stabilizing the livelihood of the people.  We will carefully consider the situation and handle it with a lenient approach as far as possible.  We hope that the general public will understand this.  Furthermore, this office handles cases very impartially. If anyone knows an outside person or a police officer and attempts to use them to lobby for illegal profits, or if anyone involved in a case tries to bribe an official of this office to request a reduced penalty, thereby damaging the reputation of this office, the donor and recipient will be severely punished without leniency. In addition to confiscating the rice, all other cases will be handled in the same way. We hope that the general public will understand the intentions of this office and cooperate.  It should be clear that there was no compulsory purchase or confiscation of daily necessities registration (soap, fireworks, candles) or this rice registration. Only incorrect and unregistered cases will be punished.  We hope that citizens will cooperate with the authorities' policies and not act in opposition. We further hope that the general public will pay attention to the proclamations and control regulations issued by the authorities and not disobey their orders."</p>
<h3>Goods Distribution Office Stops Registration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Goods Distribution Office stopped rice registration on September 1st.  Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Mr. Feng You, the director of the office, who stated the following: "Previously, in order to understand the amount of rice stored in the city, this office issued Proclamation No. 2 of the *Pei Zong* (Distribution General) series on August 4th, stipulating the method for rice registration.  Then, on August 17th, we issued Proclamation No. 13 of the *Pei Zong* series, stipulating the method for registering rice purchased after August 5th. Since its implementation, citizens have enthusiastically registered in accordance with the law.  As of August 10th, the quantity registered with this office totaled 89,448 *shi*.  After August 10th, the registration and investigation of these matters was transferred to the Economic Security Office.  The quantity and investigation situation will be officially announced by that office.  The above rice registration was originally a temporary measure. Now that it has been handled for a considerable period of time, it has been decided to stop rice registration from September 1st. All regulations in the two proclamations of August 4th and August 17th are hereby abolished."</p>
<h3>Oil and Grain Association Takes Over Mobile Application Permits - Apply to the Association Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Business Control Association, after its reorganization and establishment, is implementing the control and management of oil and grain affairs in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. In addition to formulating a comprehensive plan, which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, it is now working to manage edible oil in the Shanghai area and cracking down on hoarding and profiteering in order to stabilize market prices. It has already formulated the Shanghai Area Edible Oil Management Measures and the Shanghai Area Edible Oil Inventory Temporary Registration Rules, which have been announced and implemented. At the same time, in order to unify the management system, it has negotiated with the Business Control Association on all matters related to oil and grain mobile application permits. It has been decided that starting today (the 1st), the Oil and Grain Control Committee will take over. From now on, all members of both the miscellaneous grain industry and the edible oil industry who are engaged in miscellaneous grain and edible oil, moving in and out of these goods, can apply to the Association for a permit.</p>
<h3>Application and Procedure for Moving Soap, Candle, and Match Material Permits</h3>
<p>The Daily Necessities Control Committee will begin processing applications for the movement of soap, candle, and match materials from today (September 1st). The procedures for handling all materials movement permits have already been predetermined and announced for implementation. In order to facilitate applications, the main points are excerpted below: To apply to move daily necessities materials, apply to the receiving and dispatching section of the review department of the association. If the procedures are complete and the documents are in order, a receipt will be issued. After review, the visa procedures will be processed. All "approved," "disapproved," and "rejected" cases will be announced daily by the association according to the receipt number. Applicants should pay attention to the receipt number. If the approval has been announced, the permit can be collected. When collecting, a service fee equal to one percent of the approved amount must be paid (this service fee will not be refunded whether the permit or approval letter issued has been used or not). The association will issue a receipt. The applicant should affix the original application seal in the registration book before exchanging the receipt for the permit. After the permit and approval letter have been used up or the deadline has expired, the applicant should immediately return them to the association for cancellation. If the applicant fails to return the permit or approval letter after being notified by letter, the association may subsequently stop accepting all applications from that household. If the applicant obtains a permit or approval letter and the transportation authority is unable to ship it within the scheduled time and has conclusive proof, a new application form can be filled out and the "Application for Change of Permit Items" can be attached along with the expired permit for re-application. All procedures and procedures are the same as for the initial application, except for the service fee. If the extension is approved after review, the association will add the blue "Approved Extension" endorsement to the original permit. If it still cannot be shipped within the scheduled time after the extension, the applicant can fill out a re-application certificate and apply again for free. No further applications will be accepted after this deadline for any reason. All of the above application forms are printed by the association and sold at printing cost.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Sales Begin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Sales of household rice for mid-August ended yesterday. Sales of household rice for late August will begin tomorrow (the 2nd), with two *sheng* per person, selling for 70 yuan. A-type special distribution rice will also be sold at the same time, with each certificate entitled to purchase four and a half *sheng* of rice at a price of 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Increased Tax Revenue From Hotel and Banquet Tax</h3>
<p>Since the special tax fraud case in this city was exposed by public opinion, drawing attention from all sides, the municipal finance authorities are urgently seeking to rectify and eliminate corruption and increase tax revenue. According to recent investigations by reporters from relevant parties, the hotel and banquet tax alone has, through several days of effort, increased by more than six million yuan compared to the actual tax revenue in July. The sharp increase in this tax revenue proves that the past reduction in tax revenue was due to corruption. It is deeply hoped that the financial authorities can take further steps to eliminate corruption among their staff and further increase tax revenue.</p>
<h3>Central China Increased Production Headquarters to be Established Today</h3>
<p>In order to gather the total industrial strength of Central China and implement emergency production increases, the Japanese Embassy authorities consulted with private specialists and established the Central China Increased Production Headquarters, which is scheduled to hold an establishment ceremony at the Exchange Building on September 1st. The headquarters will be headed concurrently by Minister Usami, with Counselor Okazaki of the Embassy and Vice President Kasa of the Central China Development Company as deputy heads. A secretariat will also be established by private experts to actively promote the Central China industrial war production increase plan.</p>
<h3>Advisory Committee to Hold Seventh General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government Advisory Committee will hold its seventh general meeting this afternoon (the 1st) to discuss committee affairs. Mayor Chen will personally attend and preside over the meeting. A total of eighty-nine people discussed the bond.</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Grain Speculators Arrested, Eighty-Nine People Appeared in Court Yesterday and Were Released on Bail</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office of this city learned last month that Lu Shouliang, Xu Yuchu, Gan Chunlin, and others were all employees of the China Buy and Sell Company. Since the dissolution of the Miscellaneous Grain Association in November of last year, Lu and others took advantage of the opportunity to seek members, collect membership fees, and establish a market to buy and sell miscellaneous grains in rooms 403 to 406 of the Xie Jin Building at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, under the name of the Shanghai Regulation of People's Food Rice, Wheat, and Miscellaneous Grain Business Cooperative. Lu Shouliang was responsible for recruiting members outside, and Xu Yuchu and Shi Chunlin were responsible for managing the internal affairs. Members paid monthly membership fees of 500 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 2,000 yuan, etc., and Lu issued receipts as admission tickets. In May, the market was moved to the Gongping Building at 30 Chongqing Road due to the small space. After receiving the report, the Economic Security Office went to break it up. Lu Shouliang, Xu Yuchu, and Gan Chunlin fled upon hearing the news, and 89 people including Wang Chunfang were arrested on the spot. They were all engaged in the miscellaneous grain industry, some as bosses, some as runners, or as customers, engaging in buying and selling similar to an exchange. They were transferred to the Municipal District Prosecutor's Office by the Economic Security Office along with the evidence. After repeated investigations by the prosecutor, the 89 people were prosecuted in accordance with Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law. Yesterday morning, the case was formally opened for trial in the First Court of the District Court by Judge Shen Jikuan. After questioning each defendant about their place of origin and age, the trial began. The confessions of each defendant were almost identical, stating that they joined the market to buy and sell spot goods because there were no other markets at present. Because the number of defendants was large, the hearing was postponed to a later date after questioning until about one o'clock. Each defendant was released on bail or a cash bail of 50,000 yuan. (Note: Article 17 of the Wartime Criminal Special Law is punishable by death, life imprisonment, and a fine of no more than 100,000 yuan.)</p>
<h3>Short Commentary: It Is Valuable to Correct Mistakes</h3>
<p>Mr. Goshima, Director of the Economic Security Office, made a statement yesterday regarding the rice registration, expressing regret that the results of the rice registration were not good, especially since many violators were from the intellectual class.</p>
<p>Regarding the rice registration, since the Municipal Goods Distribution Office issued a notice on August 4th, we published an editorial on August 8th entitled "Rice Registration: No More Waiting and Seeing", explaining that the authorities' purpose in carrying out rice registration was by no means to forcibly buy it, and hoping that citizens would register on time to avoid violating the regulations and being punished. However, we also regret that some citizens did not fully understand the meaning of the law. It is commendable that the authorities can now consider the situation and handle it with a lenient approach as far as possible.</p>
<p>However, in the future, citizens should pay close attention to the wartime economic laws and regulations, and must trust the authorities and comply with the regulations. Do not adopt an indifferent attitude towards the laws and turn a blind eye, lest you violate the law and be punished. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities will also consider the citizens with sincerity. First, the legal provisions of economic control should not be too complicated, resulting in inconsistencies and making it impossible for people to know what to do. Second, it is not enough to rely solely on newspapers to announce the legal provisions, because many citizens do not read newspapers. It seems that the *Baojia* system can be used to inform each household, and wireless broadcasts can be used to explain as clearly as possible. In particular, for proclamations with time limits, there should be an appropriate extension to allow citizens to prepare fully.</p>
<p>Finally, it is hoped that when Security Office personnel go out to investigate cases, they must maintain a friendly attitude towards citizens. Outside of the assigned task, do not take the opportunity to get involved in other matters. For example, if they are ordered to check rice, they do not need to inquire about other items, so as not to cause misunderstandings among citizens.</p>
<h3>Readers' Scholarship News: Approved Scholarships to Be Claimed Quickly</h3>
<p>The approved list of the 7th Reader Scholarship Fund for major, secondary and primary schools has been fully published (see August 10th, 19th, 26th, 31st, of this newspaper).  Apart from the university and specialized college scholarships which are scheduled to be awarded on September 6th, the remainder of the secondary and primary school scholarships have been claimed on time by eight or nine out of ten students.  The remaining few students are all limited to claiming their money at the office before September 3rd, so that the accounts can be settled early.  As for transferred students, you must quickly send a letter explaining the reasons, otherwise it will be inconvenient to make changes.  Those who have already applied for a scholarship elsewhere should immediately apply for cancellation or return the check to complete the procedure.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhu Huiliang Generously Donates a Large Sum</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Huiliang of Wanli Factory generously donated 50,000 yuan for scholarships. Nian Shanren donated 20,000 yuan. Both gentlemen were moved by one thought of kindness and inspired benevolence to benefit out-of-school youth. Their merits are immeasurable.</p>
