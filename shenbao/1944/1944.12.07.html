<p>菲律賓日軍某基地六日中央社電　日航空部隊，運日在卡麥泰斯海方面續行搜擊敵魚雷艇，卒於五日拂曉在波羅島附近發見敵魚雷艇約十艘，加以猛攻後，即使其二艘受重創。又悉，日航空部隊四日晨亦曾在卡麥泰斯海南方之波賀爾島附近發見敵舟艇數艘，以機槍掃射後，即將其擊毀。</p>
<p>菲律賓五日中央社電　日空軍五日下午在菲律賓民答那峨島東方海面發現敵大遝輸船團，常對之加以攻擊，轟沉其大型運輸船一艘，炸沉中型運輸船一艘後，仍繼續反覆猛炸，預料戰果仍可陸續擴大。</p>
<h3 id="c2">雷伊泰仍豪雨　敵補給困難 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>菲島基地六日中央社電　雷伊泰島美軍，現正以全力從事補給，以大批運輸船駛入雷伊泰灣，因該地仍然連日豪雨，故陸地補給極爲困難，美軍唯有賴魚雷艇及其他大型舟艇努力運轍。雷伊泰北部之克拉香馬那庫斯那斯方面，敵軍陸地補給路仍然受日軍壓制，唯有仰賴空中補給。於卡里加拉西方孤立之美軍第二十四，第三十二兩師，爲打開活路，現正企岡自日軍間隙處潛入卡保康及里蒙之北方，但每决悉被擎退，日軍堅固之包圍網，並無少許動搖。於南部答姆拉安卡里達特南方各處，被日軍痛擊之美軍，現正極力增進據點。二日夜於巴帕似有大運輸船數艘運輸隊及武器等人港，於中部塔加米西方之美軍，時以小部隊出擊，已悉遭日軍擊潰。美軍於布羅音建築之機塲，因受日軍薰空挺隊之突襲，幾乎已失其效用，現僅能作小型機之用。</p>

<p>東京六日中央社電　於每决B29型之敵機空襲日本土時，日軍防衛勇士，莫不即將敵機擊落，建立大功，同時亦有尊貴之犧牲，如於五日之大本營發表中，曾表明於保護本土之制空陣中特別攻擊隊之誓死向敵機拼撞情形，即於十一月二十四日於東京附近向B29型拼撞而戰亡之見田義雄伍長，本月三日向敵機拼撞後，仍能駕駛半翼愛機生還之四之宮澈中尉，向敵機拼撞後持落下傘生還之板垣政雄伍長，因拼撞而壯烈戰死之澤本政美軍曹。該四勇士皆爲特別攻擊隊震天制空隊員，按該特別攻擊隊震天制空隊，與菲律賓方面決戰中編成之特別攻擊隊，係同一敢死性質者，以擊落誇恃高速及高度之B29型爲其任務。又震天制空隊之隊名，係防衛總司令官析之邇大將宮殿下所命名，期以該隊爲中心，對擾亂本土而來襲之B29型機，予以完全擊碎</p>

<p>南方前綫基地六日中央社電　日航空部隊十一月一日至二十九日止，日夜連襲摩羅泰機塲，擊毀敵機百十四架，燒却百二十架，他方由於陸軍突擊隊之活躍，敵方受損甚重。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地六日中央社電　摩羅泰敵機塲屢遭日機突擊隊之襲擊，已瀕於潰滅狀態，日夜以來，空襲哈爾馬黑拉島之敵機，減少甚多，二日僅有數架來襲，托別爾及西捷附近，敵中繼基地顯著之弱化，菲律賓方面空軍補給之困難，於此可見。</p>
<p>南方前綫基地六日中央社電　日航空部隊呼應雷伊泰日地上部隊之挺軍衝鋒戰，連績猛炸敵基地摩羅泰島機塲，使其漸次喪失機能，敵方刻正盡力增强航空兵力，企圖挽回頹勢，將新幾內亞方面之補給陸續集中於摩羅泰島，以謀送往菲律賓前綫，日航空部隊計算敵機聚集相當數量後，常即予以重大打擊。二十二日以來，連續猛烈轟炸，使敵軍幾無喘息之暇，據參加轟炸糜羅泰諸勇士形容敵基地混亂狀態謂，日機飛進　羅泰機塲時，敵軍正明張電燈，光亮如畫，澈夜忙於整備機身，我方趁此良機，照準目標。投下炸彈，當第一彈落下時，敵軍一齊滅燈，但命中彈已爆炸起火，無濟於事，第一機投彈後，少頃塲內復又點起燈火，</p>

<h3 id="c5">值得培植的清寒學子 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>本報爲便利各界關心人士直接查考讀者諸君把血汗來培植的許多學生的學業起見，特於本月一日起假靑年會舉行本報讀者助學金受助學生成績展覽會。在這展覽會中，諸君可以各用自已的眼光觀察那些成績，自已下一個判斷：究竟這些學生是不是值得培植？</p>
<p>參觀者所能注意的成績大概只是全部展覽成績的一小部份，全部展覽成績也不過是受助學生各種工作的幾個片面階段，而學生時期的學業成績更不過是終身事業的初步表現。我們希望－我們相信，幾年之後，這四千多情寒優秀的靑年，能够對於國家社會有種種偉大貢獻。那些貢爲獻，比了學生時代的成績，必然更值得我們稱許，再值得我們欽佩！</p>
<p>大多數參觀者恐怕因爲限於時間只能注意於書畫手工岡表標本一類佔着顯著地位的陳列品，來不及評閱論文特寫筆記報吿一類的長篇文字。我們尤其恐怕只有一小部份參觀者曾經翻閱過幾篇受助學生的「自述」，但每篇自述裏都充滿着有志靑年的刻苦奮鬥精神。從這種精神的表現，我們更可以相信這些學生－如果他們的學業不至中輟－將來對於國家社會的貢獻是不可限量的！</p>
<p>讀者諸君應當知道：諸君把血汗來培植的這四千多學生，他們的學業遠在普通一般學生之上。成績展覽會中有一張受助學生在校成績的統計圖表，很明白的證明這話。現在將該項統計摘錄於下：</p>
<p>成績等級一般學生的受助學生的</p>
<p>大槪百分比實得百分比</p>
<p>甲等　五·〇　一六·一</p>
<p>乙等　二〇·〇　五〇·四</p>
<p>丙等　五〇·〇　三〇·一</p>
<p>丁等　二〇·〇　三·四</p>
<p>戊等　五·〇　〇·〇</p>
<p>甲乙等的學生，即其分數在八十以上的，在普遍一般學生中的佔四分之一，而在讀者諸君所培植的學生中佔到三分之二。不及八十分，或丙等以下的，在普通一般學生中的佔四分之三，而在受助學生中僅佔三分之一。</p>
<p>因爲各校敎師的批分標準寬嚴不一，成績的等級不如名次更加不容假借，所以我們又採用成績的百分位置，統計結果如下：</p>
<p>成績百分位置一般學生的受助學生的</p>
<p>百分比　百分比</p>
<p>前列十分之一　一〇　四五</p>
<p>前列十分之二　二〇　七二</p>
<p>前列十分之三　三〇　八九</p>
<p>前列十分之四　四〇　九五</p>
<p>前列十分之五　五〇　九八</p>
<p>前列十分之六　六〇　九九</p>
<p>前列十分之七　七〇　一〇〇</p>
<p>這張統計表更加可以證明讀者諸君把血汗來培植的學生確乎遠在普通一般學生以上，確乎是優秀的，確乎是值得培植的！</p>
<p>現在一學期又將終了，各校下學期的學費勢必大增，這四千多值得培植的學生是否可以有繼續求學的機會，一定是各界人士所一致關心的。本報鑒於時間之急迫，與需款之浩大，於本月一日發表特別勸募隊辦法，希望讀者諸君本四年以來熱心助學的一貫精神，繼續各盡一分力量，使這四千多值得培植的學生不至中途輟學！</p>
<h3 id="c6">大東亞戰爭　三年來狀況 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>南京六日中央社電值茲大東亞戰爭三周年紀念來臨前夕，駐華日本大使館情報部長岸偉一氏，特於六日晚七時半，假中央廣播電合，以「際茲大東亞戰爭三周年」爲題，對在華日本居留民舉行廣播，就大東亞戰爭三年來之東亞狀况，詳加闡述，，歷時十五分鐘始畢，全文如下：</p>
<p>自大東亞戰爭爆發到現在，已屆三周年，我們所遭遇的戰局，已入重大階段，尤其在菲島方面，以雷伊泰島爲中心展開之戰局，不僅可決定大東亞戰爭之歸趨，幷可決定大東亞民族將來的命運。</p>
<p>過去一年間的戰局，在表面上看，以爲敵方勢力如何强大，日本的國防幾似乎逐漸後退。但我們不可忘記了自大東亞戰爭以來，日軍佔據土地雖是如何廣泛，目前僅在此一萬數千公里的戰綫中，其奪回一部份而已。可知日方作防衛陣，依然堅如鐵壁，毫不動搖。尤其在中　戰綫上的日軍，最近收獲赫赫戰果，駐渝美空軍基地，已經喪失大半，淪方內部亦漸有動搖的預兆。現在咸因斯蒂威爾將軍的罷免，渝美間的爭執漸形表面化。尤其渝方內部最近的人事異動，亦難吾認其爲日軍作戰的餘波。</p>
<p>回溯三年前的今日，即大東亞戰爭以前的大東亞，當時是何種狀態。當時在緬甸方面，英國利用緬甸在中國與東印度之間的位置，爲了援助渝蔣，不顧緬人的反對，開關所謂緬甸公路，並以重慶新加坡仰光形成戰略之三角形陣踐，威脅越南及泰國，堅固對甘的包圍陣。泰國方面由英使克羅斯比操縱政治，由英籍財政部顧問撑握財政全權，使泰國無異於英之屬國。其次，英國侵略東亞的根基地，以新嘉坡爲中心的馬來方面，央國又完全漠視當地的馬來亞，以之爲英國殖民地。三年前的九月，賀巴姆總司令官還以新嘉坡斷不陷落的豪語，誇張該方面的戰備完整，以威嚇日本。荷印方面因荷蘭久已採取文盲政策，所以只度尼西安民族很少能受到高等敎育，其豐富的天然資源，僅造成荷蘭本國的富有。自荷蘭政府逃亡倫敦以後，即降爲英美的傀儡，在所謂荷印交涉，敢對日本一再出以非禮熊度，在大東亞戰爭爆發時，竟漠視日本對於荷印的和平意圖，依仗英美的武力，對日宣戰。至菲律賓方面，美國予以許可獨立的空頭支票，愚弄菲島，爲對日包圍陣的一員，極力整備該島的防備。</p>
<p>然而在三年後的今日，大東亞的狀况又如何先就中國而言，所有租界已全部交還，不必再爲治外法權所拘束。去年一月，國府毅然參戰，同時緬甸菲島亦同時宣言獨立而參戰，泰國亦已與日本訂立同盟，爲解放大東亞而共同對英美作戰，並東印度亦的定獨立。馬來的原住民皆可參與政治，印度亦在鮑斯主席領導下組成國民軍，爲祖國獨立而奮鬥。我們對此大東亞努力奮鬥，實令人讚賞，大東亞劃期的大業，已漸漸向於實現之途。（待續）</p>
<h3 id="c7">日機再襲遂川機塲 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>中國前綫基地六日中央社電　日軍機隊對遂贛地區殘存之渝美空軍基地攻擊日趨激烈，故時對渝美軍痛擊。四日夜，日機再襲遂州機塲，使之四處起火，受莫大損失。又該基地防空火器極度微弱，殆無應戰力量。日機得數次反復攻撃後，全機安返。該方面之渝軍反攻亦因日軍之壓迫，漸吿停頓。</p>
<h3 id="c8">日政府增加滿鐵資金 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日政府頃鑒於滿鐵於決戰下負有重大任務，爲期其今後作盡量發展，特增加資金十億元，加算原有資本十四億，共計二十四億元，同時並提高公司債券發行限度，已於五日之閣議決定在案。按此次增資已爲第四次，意在增强決戰下之大陸運輸及撫順炭礦等各緊急重要資源之事業資金。</p>
<h3 id="c9">興亞協議會　在東京揭幕 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　興亞運動協義委員會，六·七兩日在東京舉行第一次定期會議，六日爲預備會，七日舉行正式會議，由事務局及各團體報告概况，其次並協議下列各事項：（一）以大東亞共同宣言爲基礎，關於興亞運動實踐綱要事項。（二）以興亞運動實點到綱要爲基礎，關於具體運動方策事項。（三）關於大東亞各國各地域確立興亞體制事項。（四）關於推進大東亞共榮圈內青少年運動事項。（五）關於第三次中日滿興亞團體協議關係事項。出席者中國方面代表爲東亞聯盟中國總會副秘書長周學昌，新民會喻熈傑副會長，日本方而爲興亞總本部高木本部長，森總務局長，朝比奈大日本靑少年團副團長，滿洲方面爲協和會坂田修一，又中央本部總務部長何春魁，文化部長諸氏。</p>
<h3 id="c10">以新兵器進攻謀戰爭勝利　八木總裁之語 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>東京六日中央社電　日技術院總裁更迭後，業由東京工業大學校長工學博士八木秀决氏繼任。八木新總裁乃電波兵器權威，本年五十七歲，明治末年關於電波之研究，係長波萬能時代，但氏則從事短波研究，獲相當成績，去秋日本設置研究動員會犧後，即埋頭研究製造新兵器，不久即將短波之實用價值周布於世。當茲科學技術決戰之階段，以電波兵器之權威者八木氏充日本技術界之中心，其意義實深。五日八木新總裁曾以新兵器之進攻爲題，預言爲謀戰爭之勝利，必須集結科學技術，爭取偉大之成果，欲完成之新科學技術，當於決戰下負最大之任務。</p>

<p>— 吉田工不祐</p>
<p>答：美國認爲只要何應欽和孔祥熈在重慶政權內部有勢力，則國共間的眞誠合作，始終是不可能的。比美國還要前進一步，中共認爲只要蔣介石在重慶，則國共合作是不可能的。這兩種對於國共合作的估計，都很正確。只是美國比較稍微不理解何應欽和孔祥熙的本體而已。何應欽和孔祥熈，實際上是蔣介石的化身。他們受非難和抨擊的理由，實際上就是他們過於忠實於蔣介石的意圖所致。何應欽和孔祥熙如完全消逝於政治舞台，蔣介石也就隨而消逝。中共唯其很淸楚這一點，所以拚命攻擊他們兩個人。美國唯其不淸楚這一點，所以拚命攻擊他們兩個人。這正等於說鶴頸過長，有人主張截去一段，而鶴則瘋狂地反對「多此一舉」。斯蒂威爾可是不瞭解這一理由的。他只知道何應欽和孔祥熈對國共合作有害，而就想把他們從重慶政權上截去。這樣自然就會被鶴反啄一口。今後美國如還不能理解這個理由，一定還會被啄兩口或三口。</p>
<p>問：美國旣是一個資本主義國家，究竟爲什麽這樣熱狂於國共合作呢、蘇聯對　這個問題，幾乎完全緘口不言，二者相較，眞是一件有趣的事。</p>
<p>答；美國是一個戰爭現實主義的國家，爲擊敗日本，而拚命利用所有的方法。目前主要想利用者，就是中共統治區。由於日本湖南作戰的及廣西作戰的成功，重慶統治區的美國空軍基地，幾乎毀滅無餘。將來美國在華的主要空軍基地，恐怕就是成都一處了吧！但成都經常遭受日本空軍的長程轟炸，也決不是安全地帶。因此，美國就積極於在安全地帶建造新的基地。美國就在這種企岡上注意到了中共統治區。但如不理重慶，則向中共統治區輸送空軍基地建築材料，是困難的。所以對於這一工作，首先就需要國共合作。道就是美國熱烈要求國共合作的現實主義理由。</p>
<p>還有一個重要理由，可以在美國對日本實力的重新估價中看得到。美國在太平洋上和日本軍血戰三年的結果，曉得了在同樣條件下和日本眾除戰鬥是不可能的。同樣武裝和同樣兵力，是不能正面作戰，。旣如此，只有用優世界和平即旋踵而至的美國人心理，所以很想早日結束對日戰爭。然而他認爲亞洲現狀如不起其他變化，則此次戰爭究竟將繼續多少年，是不得而知的。重慶軍隊與其說關心如何防範日本軍隊，毋寧說更加關心將來如何消滅中國共產黨軍隊。而中共軍隊固然關心如何擾亂日本軍隊，但更加關心在日本路成功，日本就可高枕無憂。於是不勝煩惱的羅斯福，就想到拖蘇聯下水。他爲早日結束大東亞戰爭計，無論如何都想使蘇聯參戰，因爲對日作戰如不在優勢條件下，則勝利是無望的。假如史太林答應參加大東亞戰爭，那末必須什麼條件呢？第一可以推想得到的，就是國共合作。蔣介石政權的獨裁專，我先把結論講出來吧！我認爲史太林在目前沒有參加反日戰爭的意圖，同時蘇聯人民也沒有這種意圖。蘇聯今日所最希望者，就是休養生息。在對德戰爭上，蘇聯的國力曾有極大損失。人民認爲歐洲問題結束後，應當首先恢復國家的元氣。史太林並不想驅使這些人民再捲入戰爭漩渦。</p>
<p>勢的兵力和武裝，來壓迫日本。美國使用這種方法，在太平洋的兩三個島嶼上，業已取得成功。在太平洋的慕爾小島上，固然使用優勢兵力和武力作戰是可能的，但在亞洲大陸上却不能一帆風順，隨心如意。這就是羅斯福的煩惱處。羅斯福因爲很知道美國人的心理，尤其是很知道認爲歐洲問題解決後軍隊佔領的區域內部盡量擴充勢力範圍。因此，爲早日結束戰爭，則非美國兩三百萬大軍登陸不爲功。這種冒險，究竟是否可能呢？如果看一看雷伊泰灣美軍登陸曾失掉多少船隻，就可找出一個答案來。如像目前這樣放棄大陸而不管，則日本很可能從新嘉坡至上海舖上一條縱貫南北的大鐵路。這條鐵制傾向如常此不改，抗戰中國的一再敗北現狀如不能打破，則史太林是不會參加反日戰爭的，同時蔣介石也不贊成他參戰。因此，這就是美國迫切希望國共合作的道理，所以美國一再派遣維爾遜特使經過莫斯科到重慶去。</p>
<p>問：但史太林會眞帮助美國完成這一野心麼？</p>
<p>答：爲了不使你性念</p>
<p>問：那末史太林在最近的演說裏，爲什麼稱日本爲侵略國呢？刺激日本，挑撥戰爭的這樣行爲，還算是規避戰爭麽？</p>
<p>答：我再向你重覆一句。蘇聯最希望的是休養生息。同時要美還需國盡可能大量轍入物資。爲取得美國的好意，而在口頭上攻擊一下日本，這豈非是一本萬利的代價麽？因此日本就乘機而向　聯開火，這種蠢事史太林是知道不會有的。自然，史太林很希望中國的國共兩黨合作。但他也知道按目前情形，國共合作是不可能的。同時，史太林也知道目前中國的抗戰主和，不是延安而是重慶。因此，史太林並不像美國那樣，急切地關心國共兩黨合作的早日實現。然而美國在一本正經地在撮合中國國共兩黨，自然史太林裝　作傻，佯作不知是辦不到的，所以只好潑口罵日本，敷衍敷衍美國。日本如連這樣小事都要記在心裏，那方是表示阿Q精神呢！</p>
<p>問：我最後要問你一句，假定你方才說的都對，那末在這樣局面上，全面和平是否可能呢？</p>
<p>答：你仔細想一想看！現在日本在東亞，是四而楚歌的情形。英·美·重慶·延安·甚至蘇聯，沒有一個國家是日本的友邦。然而重慶也同樣於陷四面楚歌表。重慶政權現在受到日本的當頭痛擊，受到美國和延安的冷嘲熱罵，蘇聯雖然對於重慶守口如瓶，保持沉默，但也決不能說是重慶的伙伴。在這樣壓迫之下，該產生何種情緒呢？</p>
<p>問：那末重慶爲什麼還不投到日本懷抱裏來呢？日本不是聲明過尊重中國的獨立目主和領土完整麼？不是按照這種平等精神在實行麼？美國恰和我們日本相反，無論怎樣在用花言巧語，保證重　的獨立自主，但現在不是干涉重慶的內政，而要求重慶政權改組麼？重慶的中國人，難道不知道美國人這種掛羊頭賣狗肉的欺騙政策麽？我認爲世界上就沒有一個國家趕得上重慶這樣蠢笨的。英美如果戰敗，當然重慶也將挫敗　但英美縱能徼倖取得勝利，而重慶仍不免失敗。</p>
<p>答：你說英美失敗也是重慶的失敗主，英美勝利也是重慶的失敗。自然，今日覺悟到這一點的中國人，在抗戰區內也決非少數，但這類中國人，對於和平區也具有這種疑問。就是說，他們認爲日本失敗則和平中國失敗，日本勝利則和平中國亦將失敗。因此他們不積極投到日本方面來。這類中國人總在心眼裏打算盤，究竟抗戰區的中國人獨立自主的生活多呢？抑是和平區的中國人獨立自主的生活多？和平區內的中國人，完全看日本人的眼色過活，在這種情形之下，日本是決不能使迫切要求獨立自主的中國人，心悅誠服的。中國人決非單純滿足於「溫情主義」和「親善主義」的。而中國人是希望與日本人並駕齊驅，，爲世界頭等國人民的。試憶我們日本明治維新時的靑年，對於民旅自尊心是有如何的敏感，知道這一點，就應當尊重中國人的民族自尊心。假如每個日本人都有這種覺悟，無論是重慶，也無論是延安，都會歡天喜地與日本握手的。我前天從漢口歸來，在漢口曾看見一件令人髮指的事。漢口的日本人（恐怕上海的日本人也不例外），雖然任何中國飯店都可以出入，但無論那一家日本「宿屋」（即旅館），却中國人不准入內。假如日本人在日本本國，被中國旅館趕出來不准入內，該有何種心境呵？如果那樣，我就會成爲一個天字第一號的「抗華論者」。</p>
<p>目前我們日本人，在中國不使單純用物質武器與英美作着殊死戰，而且在給與中國獨立自主的大競賽上，要用誠意的精神武器來與英美作殊死戰。假如我們日本，能在誠心誠意與中國以獨立自主的大競賽上，超過英美，則我相信，無論重慶和延安，都會　食　漿以迎皇軍。請夜蘭人靜，捫心自問，在中國「誠心誠意的精神鬥爭」上，是否可操左券？在這一塲而上日本在華一百萬僑民的「總力決戰體制」，是否業已達到滿意的階段？（完）魯譯</p>

<p>實地收買時，記者團曾向農民詢問意見，據常熟第一區農民稱，常熟豐收區，每畝產米有多至一石半，收買量爲四斗半，可是第一區方面，產量銳減，收買量三斗半，似乎不平均，因爲本人（農民）家有妻，子，所剩米糧，又以一斗替田主交付田賦，以致家無存米，生活困難，同時有一部分保甲長本身及彼親戚，因分配權由彼等決定，定已收買量低減，甚至並不列入收買之列，這一點，似乎不公平。</p>
<p>這次收買價格：據米統會權田副主委謂：「採取以不變苫變的有伸縮性的價格政策，不若去年全國一律，以致作繭自縛。」</p>
<p>收買價格當依照農民成本訂算，方可使農民不致吃虧，所謂成本，除勞動，原料，設備，賦稅，地租，成本之外，量重要一點，提出貢獻於收買當局，就是目前農間的苛雜稅則高於一切，例如常熟梅李一區而言，農民每月繳出每畝地方維持費六十元，此一點，希望當局也核算在成本之內（此點，在農民生活章，將詳細說明）</p>
<p>農民依照保甲長所通知收買量，將米由鄉長陪至收買處，本年食米檢收，頭等米，二等米，三等米，四等米，都有樣品，（去年甲長有將頭等米作二等米價交付農民）米經過檢收後，農民獲得現欵（去年農民有米交出，二十天後始獲現款）和收據，這種種是改善的地方。</p>
<p>在常熟梅李鎮，凡是農民有交米，有收據者到商店購貨有九折優待，這良好辦法，其他地區可以做法的。</p>
<p>（至於收買時期，糧食移動有限制，於城市及非產米區鄉間，先應確立配給制度，這一點，在配給章內詳述）</p>
<p>（四）收買食米與宣傳</p>
<p>在收買食米工作時期，同時城市鄉下，都進行着宣傳工作，這帶有政治教育性宣傳問題，是值得贊同的。</p>
<p>像常熟梅李鎮，採辦商共十人，其中有二人是協助收米，其中八人，是在各鄉村間，召集保甲長告訴這次收買食米的意義。</p>
<p>不過，記者團提出後面兩點意見。</p>
<p>第一點：常熟分辦處，所發出「爲採購米糧告民衆書」以文言文及廣泛理論及抽象內容，去告農民，在文盲向多的農村間，是要不得的，同時模棱二可的句子少用，例如常熟街上貼的標語有：「反對妨礙收買食米工作者是我們的敵人」（名中無標點），倘以標點加在第二字上，則其意義與真意完全相反，這許多是應注意的。</p>
<p>第二點，記者團所接觸官吏之中，即以高級人員而論，亦有論，亦有不少人，誤用此次收買米糧，爲收買軍米，實際上，這次「收買食米」是包括軍需和民需兩方面，在常州熟，某一宣傳班下鄉謂「上海市民沒有米吃苦痛得很。」於是農民都說：「旣然這樣，我願意把家裏的米拿出來。」結果成績異常的好，這才是宣傳成功的地方。</p>
<p>（五）對收買當局的期待</p>
<p>記都團視察收買米糧機構後，有一點，不厭反複的貢獻給收買價格問題，上海市民所關心的，是「今天主價怎樣」？在鄉下，農民所切身有關的：「就是本年收買價格怎樣？」一怕太高，一怕太低。</p>
<p>去年米統會公佈價格，是七百二十元爲收買價廿元，本年黑市價達亘古未有的高價。固然，收買價，不應當依照黑市價，但是距離太遠，與農民生活，實有重大影響，因農民以公定價買出食米，而日用品仰給於黑市，其中吃虧極大，同時與農民生計有關。</p>
<p>記者團於輪船中，邀一農民對談：彼謂：「我等希望配給物資」因彼所居鄉村，無肥皂乃以稻灰洗衣，一年無一匙糧進嘴應重視二點，一·顧及農民實際成本！二·以物資（公定價）交換米糧。</p>

<p>孔子曰：「不義而富且貴，於我如浮雲。」聖人說這兩句話，何等透澈而深刻，現在的人，很少能理解聖人超然的人生觀；否則不義而富且貴的人何以獨多？旣富且貴，還是　勿穿，拼命向富貴兩方面鑽進牛角尖，至死而不悟！大凡錢財愈多，罪孽愈深，而子孫的不肖也愈甚；結果後嗣總是爲非做歹，以至不得善終；把祖宗的孽財，化光完結，道種事例，過去如此，於今尤烈，以目前的上海而言，利用戰時做非法買賣，而發國難財的人，不知多少；利用權勢，混水撈魚，而富且貴的人，也不知多少；然而有幾人能把握正確而肖醒的人生觀呢？我敢正告富有的人們！現代的人，尤其想做將來新中國的人，「道義第一」，「仁厚第一」；聖賢遺訓，是萬古不滅的至理。如能瞭解這一點，還不如趁早做些　舉，輸財尙善，爲子孫積德，像本報爲助學金而發動「特別勸募，」真是積極而治本的義舉，請多多贊助慷慨解囊於人，於己，於國，於民，面面俱到，功德無量！</p>

<p>本市民間領袖</p>
<p>披瀝實踐戰爭决意</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭三週年紀念之日，本市各界民衆，益深同仇敵愾之心，期以總力完遂戰爭，而民間領袖，於日昨中央社記者往訪時，亦分別表示實踐戰爭之決意。茲誌其話如下：</p>
<p>李思浩</p>
<p>「大東亞戰爭爆發以后，已屆三載，吾人回憶戰爭之初，友邦日本陸海一體，一舉將英美勢力驅逐出海，使數十年來受英美壓迫之民族，得以重獲自由，努力更生。當茲決戰至最后階段，又值此聖戰之周年紀念之日，吾人應供獻一切力量，竭誠協力戰爭，備使英美殘餘勢力，澈底消滅，東亞民族，重建光明前途」。</p>
<p>聞蘭亭</p>
<p>「今日爲發動大東亞戰爭三周年紀念日，迴溯此三年中，我國與盟邦日本秉同甘共苦之精神，朝野上下一致努力，實堪欣幸，現在戰事已近決戰階段，爲復興東亞計，自應益加淬勵，以期達到最後勝利之目的。本人謬膺商業統制重任，爲戰時經濟施策之一種，實行以來，得賴各方指導，與盟邦之協力，得以粗具規模，惟因種種關係，尙未能如所期望，深盼吾工商界，益加努力，一面增加生產，一面奉行統政，以盡後方人民之職責，庶不負我政府參加戰爭之至意」。</p>
<p>袁履登</p>
<p>「大工亞戰爭發生，於茲三載，其間友邦對大東亞戰爭之供獻中，中國朝野均深明瞭，全東亞民族自由根基，從此更形鞏固，本市工商各界，早抱同一決心，故本人希望，無論前方後方，應一致盡最大力量，刻苦耐勞，供獻一切於戰爭，全東亞民族，應抱大無畏精神，務期獲得勝利而後已」。</p>

<h3 id="c34">刻不容緩的　食鹽問題 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 宋元</p>
<p>目前本市物價之高漲已灰飛煙滅一般市民最嚴重的問題，特別是日常所必需的食料，其價格之高漲更較其他一切物品威脅我們的生活。食糧，菜蔬以及和食料有相連關係之燃料，經市民之呼　及當局之注意已經謀得解決之道，惟有食鹽價格飛漲各方面似乎尙未予以重視。食鹽爲我人一日不可惑缺的　　榮養素和菜蔬調味品，其重要性實不下於食糧，並且食鹽是沒有適當代用品的，依最近食鹽上漲程度而言，實已凌駕其他一切生活必需品之上；在中秋節前後，市區內黑市鹽價約爲每斤二十元內，可是最近數日恐非百元左右不能購得，在此不滿二月間，其上漲竟遠五倍，亦不可不謂驚人。</p>
<p>我國對於食鹽向採統產統銷之國家專賣制度，所以是我國最早具有統制經濟意味之商品，以常理推之，在目今實行食鹽之統制及配給當較其他一切商品爲容易，可是事實告訴我們：在上海雖然各種市民必需的重要物品都已實行按口配給的制度，但食鹽却祇有配給證，而從未見有一次正式的配給，這真使人百思而不解其原因。本市地處濱海，附近各處如松江，淮南及兩浙均爲我國著名之產鹽區域，且製鹽原料取的於海，或晒於陽光或用沿海所產之蘆柴煎乾，決不若其他商品之生產在戰時要受到原料動力等限制而減少其產量。或云交通運輸困難食鹽來源不暢，但自市區至各鹽場距離不遠，除有鐵道，輪船，公路可通外，尙可利用民船搬運，其問題亦不至於成爲怎樣地嚴重。</p>
<p>食鹽非特爲我人日常必需之食料和調味品，且爲一重要之工業原料，其價格高漲影響所及，實不容我人忽視，況多數平民之佐餐品如　菜，乳腐及醬菜的價格，亦無不以鹽價爲轉移。故在此鹽價節節上升中，當局應謀何以抑平其價格，除由負責製銷食鹽當局解決食鹽產運上之困難外，尙望能以大量食鹽撥交物品配給處使及早實行最公平之按口配給制度，市民之食鹽問題才能得到合理之解決。尙有一點值得我們注意的就是黑市鹽的來源，雖未曾加以深究，但其中多數屬未納稅的走私鹽，當爲事實，在此戰爭決勝階段，政府經費需要孔股，稅增稅已成爲當前之急務，而此重要稅源竟有如此巨大漏　，亦應設法予以杜絕才是。</p>
<h3 id="c35">慈幼協會募款　仍盼各界盡力捐輸 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Japanese Air Attacks on Enemy Convoys in the Waters East of Mindanao; Many Transport Ships and Torpedo Boats Sunk <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Military Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese air force units, continuing their search and attack on enemy torpedo boats in the Camotes Sea area, finally discovered approximately ten enemy torpedo boats near Poro Island on the 5th at dawn. After a fierce attack, they severely damaged two of them. It is also learned that on the morning of the 4th, Japanese air force units also discovered several enemy boats near Paoay Island, south of the Camotes Sea, and destroyed them with machine gun fire.</p>
<p>Philippine, 5th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japanese air force discovered a large convoy of enemy transport ships in the waters east of Mindanao Island in the Philippines on the afternoon of the 5th and attacked them continuously. They bombed and sank one large transport ship and one medium-sized transport ship, and continued to bomb them repeatedly. It is expected that the results of the battle will continue to expand.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Continuing Heavy Rain in Leyte; Enemy Supply Difficulties <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Island Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The U.S. forces on Leyte Island are currently making every effort to resupply, with large numbers of transport ships sailing into Leyte Gulf. However, due to the continuing heavy rain in the area, land-based resupply is extremely difficult. The U.S. forces can only rely on torpedo boats and other large vessels to transport supplies. In the area of Carigara-Kananga-Ormoc in northern Leyte, the enemy's land-based supply routes are still being suppressed by Japanese forces, and they can only rely on aerial resupply. The U.S. 24th and 32nd Divisions, isolated west of Carigara, are attempting to break through the gaps in the Japanese lines and infiltrate north towards Capoocan and Limon to find a way out, but every attempt has been repelled. The Japanese forces' solid encirclement remains unshaken. In the southern areas of Damulaan-Caridad, the U.S. forces, having been severely attacked by Japanese forces, are now making great efforts to strengthen their strongholds. On the night of the 2nd, several large transport ships reportedly arrived at Palo, transporting teams and weapons. The U.S. forces west of Tagame have launched attacks with small units, but have been routed by Japanese forces. The airfield built by the U.S. forces in Burauen has been rendered almost useless due to a surprise attack by Japanese airborne troops and can now only be used by small aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Shinten Unit Strikes Enemy Aircraft <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Whenever enemy B-29 aircraft bomb Japan, Japanese defense warriors do their best to shoot down enemy planes, achieving great feats. At the same time, there are also noble sacrifices. As announced by Imperial Headquarters on the 5th, in the air defense of the homeland, special attack units are making death-defying ramming attacks on enemy aircraft. For example, Sergeant Yoshio Mita, who died on November 24 near Tokyo after ramming a B-29 aircraft, Lieutenant Toru Shinomiya, who managed to fly back with his damaged aircraft after ramming an enemy aircraft on the 3rd of this month, Sergeant Masao Itagaki, who survived after parachuting from his aircraft after ramming an enemy aircraft, and Sergeant Masami Sawamoto, who died a heroic death in a ramming attack. All four brave warriors were members of the Shinten air defense special attack unit. This special attack unit is of the same suicide nature as the special attack units formed during the decisive battle in the Philippines. Its mission is to shoot down B-29 aircraft, which boast high speed and altitude. The name "Shinten Air Defense Unit" was given by Commander-in-Chief Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, hoping that the unit would be the core force in completely destroying the B-29 aircraft that harass the homeland.</p>

<p>Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - From November 1st to 29th, the Japanese air force attacked the Morotai airfield day and night, destroying 114 enemy aircraft and burning 120. In addition, due to the activities of army commando units, the enemy suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Morotai enemy airfield has been repeatedly attacked by Japanese air commando units and is on the verge of collapse. The number of enemy aircraft attacking Halmahera Island day and night has been greatly reduced. Only a few aircraft attacked on the 2nd. The enemy's relay bases near Tobelo and Sidang are significantly weakened, demonstrating the difficulty of air force resupply on the Philippine front.</p>
<p>Southern Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - In response to the fierce attacks by Japanese ground forces on Leyte, the Japanese air force has continuously bombed the enemy base Morotai Island airfield, gradually depriving it of its functionality. The enemy is currently making every effort to increase its air power in an attempt to reverse the declining situation, continuously concentrating supplies from the New Guinea area on Morotai Island in order to send them to the Philippine front. The Japanese air force calculates the appropriate number of enemy aircraft gathered, and then inflicts heavy blows. Since the 22nd, continuous and fierce bombing has left the enemy with almost no time to breathe. According to the warriors who participated in the bombing of Morotai, describing the chaotic state of the enemy base, when Japanese aircraft flew into the Morotai airfield, the enemy was brightly lit with lights, working busily on aircraft maintenance throughout the night. Our side took advantage of this opportunity to aim at the targets and drop bombs. When the first bomb fell, the enemy extinguished all the lights, but the hits had already exploded and caught fire, to no avail. Shortly after the first aircraft dropped its bombs, the lights were turned back on inside the airfield.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Worthy and Needy Students Deserving Cultivation <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>In order to facilitate people from all walks of life who care to directly examine the academic performance of the many students cultivated by readers with their blood and sweat, this newspaper has held an exhibition of the academic achievements of students receiving aid from the newspaper's reader scholarship fund at the Youth Association starting from the first of this month. At this exhibition, everyone can use their own eyes to observe those achievements and make their own judgment: Are these students truly worthy of cultivation?</p>
<p>The achievements that visitors can pay attention to are probably only a small part of the entire exhibition. The entire exhibition is only a partial stage of the various works of the assisted students, and the academic achievements during the student period are only a preliminary expression of a lifelong career. We hope - we believe - that in a few years, these more than four thousand outstanding young people will be able to make all kinds of great contributions to the country and society. Those contributions will certainly be more worthy of our praise and more worthy of our admiration than the achievements of the student era!</p>
<p>Most visitors may only be able to pay attention to displays such as calligraphy, painting, handicrafts, and specimen tables that occupy a prominent position due to time constraints, and do not have time to review long texts such as essays, feature stories, notes, and reports. We are especially afraid that only a small number of visitors have read a few of the "self-narratives" of the aided students, but each self-narrative is filled with the hard work and struggle of aspiring young people. From this expression of spirit, we can further believe that the contributions of these students - if their studies do not stop halfway - to the country and society in the future are immeasurable!</p>
<p>Readers should know that these more than four thousand students whom you are cultivating with your blood and sweat are far above the average student in their academic performance. A statistical chart of the aided students' academic performance in the school exhibition clearly proves this. The statistics are now excerpted below:</p>
<p>Grade Level	General Students'	Aided Students'</p>
<p>Approximate Percentage	Actual Percentage</p>
<p>A	5.0	16.1</p>
<p>B	20.0	50.4</p>
<p>C	50.0	30.1</p>
<p>D	20.0	3.4</p>
<p>E	5.0	0.0</p>
<p>Students with grades of A and B, that is, their scores are above 80, account for one-fourth of ordinary students, but account for two-thirds of the students cultivated by the readers. Those with scores below 80, or grades of C or below, account for three-quarters of ordinary students, but only one-third of aided students.</p>
<p>Because the grading standards of teachers in each school vary, the level of academic performance is not as accurate as the ranking, so we also use the percentile position of academic performance. The statistical results are as follows:</p>
<p>Academic Performance Percentile	General Students'	Aided Students'</p>
<p>Percentage	Percentage</p>
<p>Top 10%	10	45</p>
<p>Top 20%	20	72</p>
<p>Top 30%	30	89</p>
<p>Top 40%	40	95</p>
<p>Top 50%	50	98</p>
<p>Top 60%	60	99</p>
<p>Top 70%	70	100</p>
<p>This statistical chart can further prove that the students cultivated by the readers with their blood and sweat are indeed far above ordinary students, are indeed excellent, and are indeed worthy of cultivation!</p>
<p>Now that another semester is coming to an end, tuition fees in various schools will inevitably increase greatly in the next semester. Whether these more than four thousand students who are worthy of cultivation can have the opportunity to continue their studies is certainly a matter of common concern to people from all walks of life. In view of the urgency of time and the enormity of the funds needed, this newspaper published a special fundraising team method on the first of this month, hoping that readers will continue to do their best with the consistent spirit of enthusiastic assistance to students over the past four years, so that these more than four thousand students who are worthy of cultivation will not drop out of school halfway!</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Situation of the Greater East Asia War Over the Past Three Years <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) On the eve of the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Mr. Kiichi Kishi, Information Director of the Japanese Embassy in China, gave a radio broadcast to Japanese residents in China at 7:30 p.m. on the 6th from the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "On the Occasion of the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War," in which he detailed the situation in East Asia over the past three years. The broadcast lasted fifteen minutes and the full text is as follows:</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the war situation we have encountered has entered a critical stage. Especially in the Philippines, the battle centered on Leyte Island will not only determine the future of the Greater East Asia War, but also the future destiny of the Greater East Asian nations.</p>
<p>On the surface, the war situation in the past year may give the impression that the enemy's strength is growing and Japan's national defense seems to be gradually retreating. However, we must not forget that since the Greater East Asia War, even though the Japanese army has occupied a vast amount of territory, at present, it has only regained a portion of this 10,000-odd kilometer battle line. This shows that the Japanese side's defensive position is still as solid as a wall and remains unshaken. Especially the Japanese army on the China front has recently achieved remarkable results. Most of the U.S. air force bases in Chongqing have been lost, and there are also signs of internal turmoil in the opposing camp. The dismissal of General Stilwell has now brought the conflict between Chongqing and the U.S. to the surface. In particular, the recent personnel changes within Chongqing are undoubtedly a ripple effect of the Japanese military operations.</p>
<p>Looking back to this day three years ago, that is, the state of Greater East Asia before the Greater East Asia War, what was the situation? At that time, in Burma, Britain used Burma's location between China and East India to assist Jiang Jieshi, regardless of the opposition of the Burmese people, and opened the so-called Burma Road, forming a strategic triangular formation with Chongqing, Singapore, and Rangoon, threatening Vietnam and Thailand, and firmly encircling the opposing party. In Thailand, British Minister Crosby manipulated politics, and the British financial advisor held full financial power, making Thailand virtually a British dependency. Secondly, Britain's base for invading East Asia, the Malay Peninsula centered on Singapore, Britain completely ignored the local Malayans and treated it as a British colony. In September three years ago, Commander-in-Chief Hoobaugh even exaggerated the completeness of the war preparations in the region with the bold statement that Singapore would never fall, in order to intimidate Japan. In the Dutch East Indies, because the Netherlands had long adopted a policy of illiteracy, few Indonesians were able to receive higher education, and its abundant natural resources only enriched the Netherlands itself. After the Dutch government fled to London, it was reduced to a puppet of Britain and the United States. In the so-called Dutch-Indies negotiations, it dared to repeatedly treat Japan with disrespect. At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it ignored Japan's peaceful intentions toward the Dutch East Indies, relied on the military force of Britain and the United States, and declared war on Japan. As for the Philippines, the United States used a empty check of promising independence to fool the Philippine Islands. It became a member of the anti-Japanese encirclement and made every effort to prepare for the defense of the island.</p>
<p>However, after three years, what is the situation in Greater East Asia? First, with regard to China, all concessions have been completely returned, and there is no longer any need to be restricted by extraterritoriality. Last January, the National Government resolutely joined the war. At the same time, Burma and the Philippine Islands also declared independence and joined the war. Thailand has also concluded an alliance with Japan and is jointly fighting against Britain and the United States for the liberation of Greater East Asia, and East India is also determining independence. The natives of Malaya can all participate in politics, and India has also formed a National Army under the leadership of Chairman Bose to fight for the independence of their motherland. We admire this Greater East Asian effort and struggle, and the epoch-making cause of Greater East Asia is gradually moving towards realization. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Chinese Front Base, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Japanese aircraft attacks on the remaining Chongqing-U.S. air force bases in the Suichuan-Ganzhou area have become increasingly fierce, causing heavy blows to the Chongqing-U.S. forces. On the night of the 4th, Japanese aircraft attacked the Suichuan airfield again, setting it ablaze and causing tremendous damage. In addition, the anti-aircraft firepower of the base is extremely weak, with almost no ability to fight back. After repeated attacks by Japanese aircraft, all aircraft returned safely. The counter-offensive of the Chongqing army in the area has gradually come to a halt due to the pressure of the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the change of president of the Japanese Technical Institute, it has now been succeeded by Dr. Hideji Yagi, President of Tokyo Institute of Technology. The new president, Yagi, is an authority on radio wave weapons, 57 years old this year. At the end of the Meiji era, his research on radio waves was in the era of long waves, but he engaged in short wave research and achieved considerable results. After Japan established the Research Mobilization Committee last autumn, he devoted himself to researching and manufacturing new weapons, and soon the practical value of short waves will be widely known to the world. At the stage of scientific and technological decisive battles, the appointment of Mr. Yagi, an authority on radio wave weapons, as the center of the Japanese technical world, has profound significance. On the 5th, the new president Yagi gave a speech entitled "Offensive with New Weapons," predicting that in order to win the war, science and technology must be concentrated to strive for great achievements, and the new science and technology to be completed must assume the greatest task under the decisive battle.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Fierce Battle for Saarlautern Reaches Climax <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas News Agency: The Battle of Saarlautern reached a new climax yesterday. U.S. forces occupied the ancient castle on the 3rd, but were driven out by German forces the next day. After a fierce battle yesterday, the two sides each occupied half of the castle, and are now engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The two sides have 600 soldiers. The castle has been reduced to ashes. Yesterday, U.S. forces crossed the river on the north and south sides of the city, but the bridgeheads they established are now being heavily shelled by German artillery. In the past five days, the U.S. has lost more than 100 tanks.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - (1) On the Western Front, from the Roer River to 35 kilometers north of Cologne, the anti-Axis forces are attempting to attack with a large amount of materiel, but have been blocked by German resistance. According to front-line news from the anti-Axis side, the city of Saarlautern has been occupied. The anti-Axis forces launched an offensive at dawn on the 4th, and the infantry of the U.S. Third Army's Second Division and the First Armored Division have reached a point 10 kilometers from Saarbrücken.</p>

<p>Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Havas News Agency: Soviet forces in Hungary have established a bridgehead near Dalj, south of the mouth of the Trava River in the Danube River bend, and are preparing to cross the river in force. Because the German defenses in the Zigetvar-Gaboš area on the north bank are solid, the Soviet forces are attempting to advance towards Croatia from here. Fierce fighting is now taking place on both sides of the road connecting Zigetvar and Gaboš. The Soviet forces intend to advance towards Lake Balaton. At the same time, the advance of the Soviet right wing on the west bank of the Danube towards Dunaföldvár has been blocked between Lake Balaton and the Danube. The enemy has also launched a fierce attack in northeast Hungary, attempting to break through the German lines in a small area.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Grewe Resigns as U.S. Under Secretary of State <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Lisbon, 6th - A Huitong Agency dispatch relays U.S. news: American diplomatic circles greatly value Grewe's appointment as Under Secretary of State, as he represents a proponent of a conciliatory policy towards Japan, which is strongly opposed by American military personnel. Grewe previously served as Under Secretary of State during the Coolidge presidency from 1924-1927. A Republican, he served as the Ambassador to Japan from 1932 until the Pearl Harbor attack. Grewe's appointment as Under Secretary of State at this stage of the Greater East Asia War is indeed noteworthy. As early as January 27, 1941, Grewe issued a warning that war was almost unavoidable if President Roosevelt did not change his policy towards Japan. On November 26th and 28th, shortly before the Pearl Harbor attack, Grewe repeatedly warned the U.S. government, but the U.S. Army Department ignored him. Grewe's two books point out the developed and robust strength of Japanese industry, cautioning Americans against underestimating it. Within the U.S. State Department, Grewe is undoubtedly a veteran statesman, whose experience far surpasses that of Secretary of State Stettinius. Therefore, diplomatic circles believe that Stettinius's role is merely to serve as a liaison for Roosevelt.</p>

<p>Central News Agency, Swedish Capital, 6th - A Huitong Agency dispatch relays that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced: The Soviet government has appointed Litvinov as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Australia. The previous envoy has been recalled and assigned to other duties. Litvinov was born in 1904. From 1931 to 1934, he served as the Soviet Trade Representative to China, and in 1936, he became the Director of the Far Eastern Department of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Reorganization of the Kuomintang and Cooperation Between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party (II) <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Yoshida Kunisuke</p>
<p>Answer: The United States believes that as long as He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi hold power within the Chongqing regime, genuine cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party will remain impossible. Taking it a step further than the United States, the Chinese Communist Party believes that as long as Chiang Kai-shek is in Chongqing, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is impossible. Both of these assessments of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are correct. However, the United States is slightly less understanding of the true nature of He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi. In reality, He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi are the embodiment of Chiang Kai-shek. The reason they are criticized and attacked is precisely because they are too loyal to Chiang Kai-shek's intentions. If He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were to completely disappear from the political stage, Chiang Kai-shek would also disappear along with them. The Chinese Communist Party is very clear about this, which is why they are attacking the two of them so desperately. The United States is attacking the two of them so desperately because they are not clear about this. This is like saying that a crane's neck is too long, and someone suggests cutting off a section, while the crane frantically opposes this "unnecessary action." Stilwell did not understand this reason. He only knew that He Yingqin and Kong Xiangxi were harmful to cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and so he wanted to cut them off from the Chongqing regime. Naturally, he would be pecked by the crane in response. If the United States still cannot understand this reason in the future, they will definitely be pecked two or three more times.</p>
<p>Question: Since the United States is a capitalist country, why is it so enthusiastically promoting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party? The Soviet Union is almost completely silent on this issue. The contrast between the two is truly interesting.</p>
<p>Answer: The United States is a nation of wartime realism, desperately using all methods to defeat Japan. Currently, the primary thing they want to utilize is the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas. Due to the success of Japan's Hunan and Guangxi operations, the American airbases in the Chongqing-controlled area have been almost completely destroyed. In the future, the primary American airbase in China will likely be Chengdu! However, Chengdu is frequently subjected to long-range bombing by the Japanese air force and is by no means a safe zone. Therefore, the United States is actively building new bases in safe areas. The United States has noticed the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas with this goal in mind. However, if Chongqing is ignored, it will be difficult to transport construction materials for the airbases to the Chinese Communist Party's controlled areas. Therefore, cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is necessary for this task. That is the realistic reason why the United States is so eagerly requesting cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.</p>
<p>There is also an important reason that can be seen in the United States' reassessment of Japan's strength. After three years of bloody fighting with the Japanese military in the Pacific, the United States has realized that fighting the Japanese on equal terms is impossible. It is impossible to fight head-on with the same weapons and the same number of troops. Given this, the only option is to use a military advantage. The American psyche is such that they yearn for world peace to arrive quickly, so they are eager to end the war against Japan as soon as possible. However, they believe that if the current situation in Asia does not undergo other changes, it is impossible to know how many more years this war will continue. The Chongqing army is more concerned with how to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party army in the future than with how to defend against the Japanese army. While the Chinese Communist Party army is concerned with how to harass the Japanese army, they are even more concerned that a Japanese victory would allow Japan to rest easy. Beset by troubles, Roosevelt considered pulling the Soviet Union into the conflict. In order to end the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible, he wanted the Soviet Union to join the war, because victory was impossible without a position of advantage in the war against Japan. If Stalin agreed to participate in the Greater East Asia War, what conditions would be necessary? The first, and most easily anticipated, is cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Chiang Kai-shek's regime is autocratic and despotic. Let me start with the conclusion: I don't think Stalin has any intention of joining the anti-Japanese war at the moment, and the Soviet people have no such intention either. What the Soviet Union wants most today is to recuperate and rebuild. In the war against Germany, the Soviet Union's national power suffered great losses. The people believe that once the European problem is resolved, the country's strength should be restored first. Stalin does not want to drive these people into the vortex of war again.</p>
<p>force and weaponry to suppress Japan. The United States has already achieved success using this method on two or three islands in the Pacific. While it is possible to use superior force and weaponry to fight on the small island of Muer in the Pacific, it is not possible to have everything go smoothly on the Asian continent. This is Roosevelt's problem. Roosevelt knows the American psyche very well, especially the fact that the American people, once the European problem is resolved, want to bring the troops home as soon as possible. So, in order to end the war as soon as possible, it would take an invasion of two or three million American troops. Is this kind of venture possible? If one looks at how many ships the American landing at Leyte Gulf lost, one can find an answer. If the continent is abandoned as it is now, Japan may be able to lay a north-south railway from Singapore to Shanghai. If this policy is not changed, and if the repeated defeats of China in the War of Resistance cannot be broken, then Stalin will not participate in the anti-Japanese war, and Chiang Kai-shek will not agree to his participation either. Therefore, this is why the United States is so eager for cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. This is why the United States has repeatedly sent special envoy Willkie to Chongqing via Moscow.</p>
<p>Question: But would Stalin really help the United States fulfill this ambition?</p>
<p>Answer: In order to prevent you from mistakenly thinking,</p>
<p>Question: Then why did Stalin call Japan an aggressor in his recent speech? Is this kind of behavior of stimulating Japan and provoking war considered avoiding war?</p>
<p>Answer: Let me repeat one sentence to you. What the Soviet Union wants most is to recuperate and rebuild. At the same time, the Soviet Union also needs the United States to ship as many supplies as possible. To gain favor with the United States, and to verbally attack Japan, isn't this a cost-effective exchange? Therefore, Stalin knows that Japan would not be so foolish as to take this opportunity to open fire on the Soviet Union. Of course, Stalin very much hopes that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China will cooperate. But he also knows that cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is impossible under the current circumstances. At the same time, Stalin also knows that the main proponent of peace with Japan in China is not Yan'an but Chongqing. Therefore, Stalin is not as eager as the United States for the early realization of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. However, since the United States is earnestly trying to bring the Kuomintang and the Communist Party together, Stalin cannot pretend to be foolish and act as if he doesn't know. So, he has no choice but to scold Japan and appease the United States. If Japan takes even such a small thing to heart, then that is a sign of the spirit of Ah Q!</p>
<p>Question: I have one last question for you. Assuming that everything you said is correct, then in such a situation, is comprehensive peace possible?</p>
<p>Answer: Think carefully! Japan is currently in a situation of facing enemies on all sides in East Asia. Not a single country—Britain, the United States, Chongqing, Yan'an, or even the Soviet Union—is an ally of Japan. However, Chongqing is also in a similar situation, surrounded by enemies on all sides. The Chongqing regime is now being directly attacked by Japan, and being coldly ridiculed by the United States and Yan'an. Although the Soviet Union is keeping its mouth shut about Chongqing and remaining silent, it cannot be said to be a partner of Chongqing. What kind of emotions will be generated under such oppression?</p>
<p>Question: Then why doesn't Chongqing come into the embrace of Japan? Hasn't Japan declared that it respects China's independence, autonomy, and territorial integrity? Isn't it acting in accordance with this spirit of equality? The United States, on the other hand, is doing the opposite of us Japanese. No matter how much it uses flowery words to guarantee Chongqing's independence and autonomy, isn't it now interfering in Chongqing's internal affairs and demanding the reorganization of the Chongqing regime? Don't the Chinese people in Chongqing know about the United States' deceitful policy of selling dog meat under the pretense of selling mutton? I believe that there is no country in the world that is as stupid as Chongqing. If Britain and the United States are defeated, then Chongqing will of course also be defeated. But even if Britain and the United States are lucky enough to win, Chongqing will still be defeated.</p>
<p>Answer: You say that Chongqing's failure is the result of both the failure of Britain and the United States, and the victory of Britain and the United States. Naturally, there are a considerable number of Chinese people in the War of Resistance areas who are aware of this today, but these Chinese people also have this question about the peace areas. That is to say, they believe that if Japan fails, then peaceful China fails, and if Japan wins, then peaceful China will also fail. Therefore, they are not actively coming over to the Japanese side. These Chinese people are always calculating in their minds, is there more independent and autonomous living for the Chinese in the War of Resistance areas, or is there more independent and autonomous living for the Chinese in the peace areas? The Chinese people in the peace areas are completely living under the watchful eyes of the Japanese. Under these circumstances, Japan can never sincerely convince the Chinese people who are eager for independence and autonomy. The Chinese people are by no means merely satisfied with "sentimentalism" and "friendshipism." Rather, the Chinese people hope to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Japanese and become a first-class people in the world. Think back to the youth of our Japanese Meiji Restoration, how sensitive they were to national self-esteem. Knowing this, we should respect the national self-esteem of the Chinese people. If every Japanese person had this awareness, then whether it is Chongqing or Yan'an, they would all be delighted to shake hands with Japan. The day before yesterday, I returned from Hankou, where I saw a shocking thing. Although the Japanese people in Hankou (and probably the Japanese people in Shanghai as well) can enter any Chinese restaurant, Chinese people are not allowed to enter any Japanese "inn" (i.e., hotel). If the Japanese people were driven out of Chinese hotels in Japan and not allowed to enter, what kind of feeling would they have? If that were the case, I would become the number one "anti-China advocate."</p>
<p>At present, we Japanese are not only using material weapons to fight to the death with Britain and the United States in China, but also using the spiritual weapon of sincerity to compete with Britain and the United States in granting China independence and autonomy. If we Japanese can surpass Britain and the United States in the competition of sincerely granting China independence and autonomy, then I believe that both Chongqing and Yan'an will bring food and drink to welcome the Imperial Army. Please, in the quiet of the night, ask yourselves, can we be confident in the "sincere spiritual struggle" in China? Has the "total war system" of the one million Japanese expatriates in China reached a satisfactory stage in this regard? (End) Translated by Lu</p>

<h3 id="e23">Various Organizations to Hold Grand Celebration Tomorrow, Celebrating the Third Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>To celebrate the third anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai News Federation has specifically joined forces with five organizations, including the China Film Company, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, the Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Industry and Commerce Friendship Association, to hold a grand celebration. With the support of the Japanese Army and Navy Press Departments, the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and the Municipal Propaganda Office, the celebration will be held on the 8th of this month. There are three events: (1) At 2:00 PM, the play "Turning Back is the Shore" will be performed at the Lyceum Theatre, with dozens of famous film stars participating in an all-star cast. The performance aims to raise funds for the Greater East Asia Essay Competition, with ticket prices slightly charged at three levels: 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, and 300 yuan. These tickets have already gone on sale at the Lyceum Theatre box office starting at 10:00 AM today (7th). The organizing authorities, due to the high price of up to 10,000 yuan for the previous performance of this play at the Lyceum Theatre and the extremely crowded audience, and the lower ticket prices for this performance, in order to prevent profiteers from buying and selling on the black market, specially dispatched personnel to closely monitor the area around the theater. (2) At 5:00 PM, a "Citizens' Celebration Meeting" will be held at the Grand Cathay Theatre, with speeches by prominent Chinese and Japanese figures and the screening of the latest blockbuster film "Spring River Regret." (3) At 3:00 PM, a soccer game will be held at the Yiyuan Garden, featuring a match between the local famous teams of the Three Provinces and Jilin. The strength of both sides is evenly matched, and there will certainly be many thrilling performances. It is also reported that the "Greater East Asia War Third Anniversary Commemorative War Trophy and Photography Exhibition," jointly organized by the Shanghai News Federation and the East Asia Transportation Corporation, has been open to the public at the Army Dormitory on Jing'an Temple Road (next to the International Hotel) for several days, with more than 10,000 visitors daily, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere.</p>
<p>Youth Grand Parade Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Headquarters of the China Youth League and the Fourth Regiment of the China Youth Model Corps, in order to promote the resolutions of the Second Greater East Asia Youth Guidance Conference and implement the Rising Up with Asia movement, have specifically invited representatives from relevant agencies to organize the Shanghai Special City Implementation Committee for the China Youth Implementation and Rising Up with Asia Movement. It is reported that the committee is scheduled to hold a dawn mobilization at 7:00 AM on the 8th of this month, dividing the entire city of Shanghai into six districts: (1) South Shanghai District, (2) East Shanghai District, (3) North Shanghai District, (4) West Shanghai District, (5) Central Shanghai District A, and (6) Central Shanghai District B. On that day, members of the youth league in each district will gather on time at their respective designated locations to participate, with as many as sixty schools participating. After gathering at the designated locations, they will depart towards the racecourse. Subsequently, a grand meeting for implementation and rising up with Asia will be held at the Grand Cathay Theatre. After the meeting, all members of the youth league will participate in a grand parade, departing from the Grand Cathay Theatre, passing through Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, Henan Road, Great Shanghai Road, and Xizang Road, and disbanding in front of the New World.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Air Raid Relief Designated Hospitals Responsible Divided into Fifteen Districts According to Baojia System <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Civil Air Defense Headquarters Relief Department held a meeting of directors of public and private hospitals with operating rooms at the Municipal Government Conference Room at 3:00 PM on the 5th to discuss air raid relief issues. After discussion, it was decided to divide all hospitals in the city into fifteen districts according to the Baojia system. The First Changning District will be covered by the Obstetrics Hospital, the Second Huashan District by the Shanghai Local Hospital, the Third Changshu District by the Chinese Red Cross First Hospital, the Fourth Jiangning District by the Chinese Red Cross Third Hospital, the Fifth Putuo District by the Municipal Special District Hospital, the Sixth Jing'an Xincheng District by the Hong'en Hospital, the Seventh Lujiawan District by the Nanyang Hospital, the Eighth Laozha Huangpu District by the Tongren First Hospital, the Ninth Taishan District by the Siming Hospital, the Tenth Zhabei District by the Jimin Hospital, the Eleventh Yimiao District by the Nanshi Relief Hospital, the Twelfth Penglai District by the Chu Seng Hospital, the Thirteenth Xixieqiao District by the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, the Fourteenth Xujiahui District by the Sanitary Experiment District, and the Fifteenth Pudong District by the Municipal Pudong Hospital. These hospitals will be responsible for the hospitals within their respective districts, and all surgeons in the district's hospitals will be organized and directed by the designated hospital to prepare for treatment work in the event of an air raid. In addition, the thirteen health centers under the jurisdiction of the Health Bureau and the Nanshi Health Office were designated as relief stations. The Health Bureau will also begin to organize relief and reception centers. Afterwards, civilians injured in bombings will first receive hemostasis and bandaging at the relief stations, and those with serious injuries requiring surgery will be sent to nearby hospitals for surgery to reduce the mortality rate of the injured. Finally, it was decided to hold a second meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th of this month in the Health Bureau's 207 Library. Directors of the designated hospitals in each district are requested to report the detailed organization of relief in their respective districts to the Relief Department at that time in order to issue appointment letters and jointly plan the progress.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Security Command Captures Two Pirates <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Security Command of this city recently received a secret report that the pirate leader Lu Xianglin (also known as A Lin), who was entrenched in the Xiaochuansha Xuejing Tangkou Sea area of Baoshan County, was leading his gang to commit armed robberies on passing merchant ships at sea. Two pig boats were robbed of eighty-two pigs, netting more than 800,000 yuan. Grain ships and cotton ships were also robbed, netting tens of thousands of yuan, which was divided up for use. After the robberies, sailors and merchants were often thrown into the sea to drown. The department dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and arrested the pirate leader Lu Xianglin on the 17th of last month, bringing him back for questioning. After confirming that the crime was true, he was immediately handed over to the department's military law office for trial. In addition, Wei Xiangfa and Wang Tianrong, subordinates of Chen Guosheng, a roaming bandit in Pudong, recently sent threatening letters to Zhang Xuchu, the town head of Xiangtangqiao Town in Pudong, and Zhu Hongdao, the owner of a milk shed in Sanguantang, and other wealthy merchants to extort money, acting lawlessly. In November, they assassinated Sun De, the former platoon leader of the Independent Brigade of the Fourth Security Regiment. The Security Command dispatched personnel to sneak into the rural areas and managed to capture Wei Xiangfa and Wang Tianrong. After bringing them back for questioning, they confessed without hesitation. The suspects have also been handed over to the military law office for interrogation.</p>

<p>The City Goods Supply Office has adjusted the distribution time for rationed rice at the Jiangsu Road, Changning Road, Guilin Road, Xuhua Fang and other eight "public" sales outlets under its jurisdiction. The daily distribution time will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and from 12:30 PM to 5:30 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e29">A Record of Su Kunyu's Inspection of Rice-Producing Areas (Part Two) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>During the actual purchasing process, the reporter group inquired about the opinions of farmers. According to farmers from Changshu's first district, in the abundant harvest areas of Changshu, the yield per mu (Chinese acre) was as high as one and a half shi (a unit of dry measure), with a purchase volume of four and a half dou (another unit of dry measure). However, in the first district, the yield decreased sharply, with a purchase volume of three and a half dou, which seemed uneven. This was because the farmer had a wife and children, and after the remaining grain was used to pay the landlord's land tax at a rate of one dou, there was no rice left at home, making life difficult. At the same time, some Baojia (local administrative units) chiefs and their relatives, because the right of allocation was determined by them, set the purchase volume low, or even did not include some farmers in the purchase list, which seemed unfair.</p>
<p>Regarding this purchase price, Deputy Director Quan Tian of the Rice Control Association stated: "We are adopting a flexible price policy that changes with the situation, unlike last year's nationwide uniform price, which led to self-inflicted problems."</p>
<p>The purchase price should be calculated based on the farmers' costs to avoid losses for them. The so-called costs, in addition to labor, raw materials, equipment, taxes, and land rent, also include a very important point that should be brought to the attention of the purchasing authorities, namely, that the current exorbitant miscellaneous taxes in rural areas are higher than everything else. For example, in the Meili area of Changshu, farmers pay 60 yuan per mu per month for local maintenance fees. It is hoped that the authorities will also factor this into the cost (this point will be explained in detail in the chapter on farmers' lives).</p>
<p>Farmers, according to the purchase volume notified by the Baojia chiefs, accompany the township head to the purchasing point with their rice. This year, there are samples for the inspection of first-class rice, second-class rice, third-class rice, and fourth-class rice (last year, some Jia chiefs delivered first-class rice at the price of second-class rice to the farmers). After the rice is inspected, farmers receive cash (last year, some farmers received cash only 20 days after delivering the rice) and receipts. These are all improvements.</p>
<p>In Meili Town, Changshu, all farmers who have delivered rice and have receipts receive a 10% discount when purchasing goods in stores. This is a good method that can be adopted in other areas.</p>
<p>(As for the purchase period, there are restrictions on the movement of grain. A rationing system should be established first in cities and rural areas outside of rice-producing areas. This point will be detailed in the rationing chapter.)</p>
<p>(IV) Purchasing Rice and Propaganda</p>
<p>During the period of purchasing rice, propaganda work is being carried out in both cities and rural areas. This propaganda, which has a political and educational nature, is worthy of approval.</p>
<p>In Meili Town, Changshu, for example, there are a total of ten purchasing merchants, two of whom assist in purchasing rice, while the other eight gather Baojia chiefs in various villages to explain the significance of this rice purchase.</p>
<p>However, the reporter group raises the following two points.</p>
<p>First, the "Notice to the Public Regarding the Purchase of Grain" issued by the Changshu branch office, using classical Chinese, broad theories, and abstract content to inform farmers, is undesirable in rural areas where illiteracy is prevalent. At the same time, ambiguous sentences should be used less. For example, a slogan posted on the streets of Changshu reads: "Those who oppose hindering the work of purchasing rice are our enemies" (without punctuation in the original). If punctuation is added after the second word, its meaning is completely opposite to the true intention. These are many things that should be paid attention to.</p>
<p>Second, among the officials the reporter group encountered, even senior personnel, there are quite a few who mistakenly use this rice purchase as a purchase of military rice. In fact, this "rice purchase" includes both military and civilian needs. In Changzhou, a propaganda team went to the countryside and said, "The citizens of Shanghai are suffering greatly from a lack of rice." As a result, the farmers all said, "Since that's the case, I'm willing to take out the rice from my home." The results were exceptionally good, and this is where the propaganda succeeded.</p>
<p>(V) Expectations for the Purchasing Authorities</p>
<p>After inspecting the rice purchasing organization, the reporter group repeatedly contributes one point to the issue of purchasing prices. What the citizens of Shanghai are concerned about is "What is the main price today?" In the countryside, what is directly related to the farmers is: "What is this year's purchasing price?" One is afraid of it being too high, and the other is afraid of it being too low.</p>
<p>Last year, the Rice Control Association announced a price of 720 yuan per shi, with a purchase price of 20 yuan. This year, the black market price has reached an unprecedented high. Of course, the purchase price should not be based on the black market price, but the distance is too far, which has a significant impact on farmers' lives, because farmers sell their rice at the official price, while daily necessities rely on the black market, resulting in great losses. At the same time, it is related to the farmers' livelihood.</p>
<p>The reporter group invited a farmer for a conversation on the ship. He said: "We hope for rationed goods." Because his village has no soap, they wash clothes with rice ash, and they haven't had a spoonful of grain in their mouths for a year. Two points should be emphasized: 1. Take into account the actual costs of farmers! 2. Exchange rice for goods (at official prices).</p>

<h3 id="e30">Reader's Education Aid News: Urging Wealthy People in Shanghai to Generously Donate Money to Support Education <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Confucius said: "Wealth and rank attained through unrighteousness are to me as drifting clouds." How profound and insightful are these words of the sage. Few people today can understand the sage's transcendent view of life; otherwise, why are there so many people who are wealthy and ranked through unrighteousness? Having become rich and noble, they still do not know contentment and desperately try to drill into the horns of wealth and nobility, not awakening until death! In general, the more money one has, the deeper the sins, and the more unfilial the descendants. As a result, the descendants always engage in wrongdoing and do not have a good end, squandering the ancestral ill-gotten wealth. Such examples have been seen in the past and are even more prevalent today. Taking present-day Shanghai as an example, who knows how many people are making illegal transactions during wartime and profiting from the national crisis? Who knows how many people are taking advantage of their power and authority to fish in troubled waters and become rich and noble? However, how many people can grasp a correct and enlightened view of life? I dare to tell the wealthy people! People of modern times, especially those who want to be people of the new China in the future, should put "righteousness first" and "benevolence first." The teachings of the sages are eternal truths. If you can understand this point, it is better to do some good deeds as soon as possible, donate money for good causes, and accumulate virtue for your descendants. Like this newspaper's "special fundraising" for education aid, it is truly an active and fundamental righteous act. Please support it generously, benefiting others, oneself, the country, and the people, achieving boundless merit in every aspect!</p>
<p>Shen Zhuxi's Wedding Anniversary Education Aid</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Shen Tinghai and Ms. Zhu Wanfen, in commemoration of their tenth wedding anniversary, formed a "Tin Wedding Team" and generously donated 20,000 yuan, demonstrating the deep affection of the couple and achieving a double benefit. It is hoped that happy couples in Shanghai, whether "golden wedding," "silver wedding," "engagement," or "new wedding," can all recognize team donation fund-raising to support education, in order to establish a new model of family.</p>
<p>Shao Huaichu's Sincere and Benevolent Intentions</p>
<p>Mr. Shao Huaichu expressed deep sympathy for the "special fundraising" organized by this newspaper and specially donated to one team, saying that this money was a new unexpected income and he dared not selfishly enjoy it, but donated it for education aid. His intentions are sincere and benevolent. In the Shanghai business community, accidental income, often hundreds of millions, is often received with a wave of the hand, extravagant personal enjoyment, and senseless consumption. It is hoped that they can also generously donate to meaningful good deeds.</p>
<p>Yu Fa Company Sells Candy to Support Education</p>
<p>Yu Fa Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory wrote: "Our factory, in view of the fact that most of the pure chemical drugs used in our country are imported, has only researched and created anhydrous glucose and calcium gluconate and other pure chemical drugs, which have always been valued by the pharmaceutical industry. Now, in order to provide universal flower care and serve the society, we have specially processed and formulated the above-mentioned anhydrous glucose and calcium gluconate to make "Yu Fa Glucose" and "Yu Fa Calcium" tablets. Its characteristic is that it can be directly absorbed by cells without digestion, which helps to promote development, increase appetite, and relieve fatigue. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, puppet shows will be held at the Lanxin Theater at 3 pm and 5 pm every afternoon, inviting the Shanghai Puppet Troupe to perform famous children's plays "Flame Mountain," "Swan," "Hall of Longevity," and "Primeval World." Those who purchase Yu Fa Calcium and Yu Fa Glucose from major pharmacies will receive free tickets. At the same time, tickets will be sold at the Lanxin Theater, divided into 100 yuan, 200 yuan, and 300 yuan three kinds, each ticket attached with "Yu Fa Calcium" one pack, two-day ticket income, commission donation to your newspaper's education aid fund, a small expression of gratitude, hoping for your support."</p>
<p>Yesterday's Education Aid Received: Su Baogen 1,800 yuan, Mr. He 1,000 yuan, Qian Ji (in memory of the first birthday) 500 yuan, Mr. Huang 350 yuan, Pu Qiting (in memory of Cai Wengpo) 100 yuan, totaling 3,750 yuan, balance 6,784,871 yuan.</p>

<p>— Le Tian</p>
<p>The Fellow Artists' Art Exhibition, hosted by Shanghai Industry and Xinghua, was held this week at the China Painting Gallery. The writer visited on the opening day and saw a total of 350 pieces of calligraphy, painting, and photography, arranged in a winding and interesting way. It is said that this art exhibition has two noteworthy points: the organizers Chen Zhitang, Chuan Longcai, Che Bingke, and Wu Daoping encouraged colleagues to pursue spare-time studies and promote literature and art, and specially initiated the art exhibition to achieve the effect of voice and response. Secondly, in response to this newspaper's education aid fund "special fundraising," with the friendship of music and goodness, sales proceeds were donated to education, and the ten artists who participated in the production all gladly agreed and looked forward to its success. This kind of education aid is truly commendable.</p>
<p>In general, the works of the art exhibition have their own merits. Cai Tianshou's photography is clear, beautiful, outstanding, and extraordinary. Such as "Inspiration Flashing Apart," the sky clouds, layer by layer into the camera, the color is beautiful. "Clouds Light Wind Light" depicts the tranquility of nature. "Clouds Scattered Lonely Standard See" shows the depth of all things in autumn, and the tower on the wind and clouds, people think back. "Lonely Berth Frame" takes the color, all to the top. Each is titled by Xu Shuchen, which is especially characteristic. Wang Xiaolou made "Creek Mountain Cane," an old man walking alone in Creek Mountain, so that people raised the mind of fluttering away, the painting landscape, magnificent, never had.</p>
<p>Local Civil Leaders of this City</p>
<p>Express Resolve to Implement War</p>
<p>On the third anniversary of the Great East Asia War, the people of all walks of life in this city deepened their determination to fight against the enemy and vowed to complete the war with all their strength. When reporters from the Central News Agency visited the civil leaders yesterday, they also expressed their determination to implement the war. The following is a record of their words:</p>
<p>Li Sihao</p>
<p>"It has been three years since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War. We recall that at the beginning of the war, our friendly country, Japan, united its army and navy, and drove the British and American forces out of the sea in one fell swoop, allowing the nations that had been oppressed by Britain and America for decades to regain their freedom and strive for regeneration. At this critical stage of the final battle, and on the anniversary of this holy war, we should offer all our strength, sincerely cooperate with the war, and prepare to completely eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and America, so that the nations of East Asia can rebuild a bright future."</p>
<p>Wen Lanting</p>
<p>"Today is the third anniversary of the launch of the Great East Asia War. Looking back over these three years, our country and our ally, Japan, have shared the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and have made concerted efforts from top to bottom, which is truly gratifying. Now that the war is approaching the decisive stage, in order to revitalize East Asia, we should be even more diligent in order to achieve the ultimate goal of victory. I have been entrusted with the important task of commercial control, which is one of the wartime economic measures. Since its implementation, it has been able to take shape with the guidance of all parties and the cooperation of our allies. However, due to various reasons, it has not yet met expectations. I sincerely hope that our industrial and commercial circles will work harder to increase production on the one hand and implement the unified government on the other, so as to fulfill the responsibilities of the people in the rear and not live up to the sincere intentions of our government to participate in the war."</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng</p>
<p>"The Great East Asia War has been going on for three years now. During that time, the Chinese government and people have been fully aware of the contributions of our allies to the Great East Asia War. The foundation of freedom for all East Asian nations has been further consolidated. The industrial and commercial circles of this city have long held the same determination. Therefore, I hope that whether in the front or the rear, we should all exert our greatest efforts, endure hardships and toil, and contribute everything to the war. All East Asian nations should embrace the spirit of fearlessness and strive to achieve victory."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory, compiled and printed by this newspaper, was originally scheduled to be published at the end of October. However, due to the large content and the time required for printing, the printing house responsible for printing has been repeatedly subjected to power restrictions, making it impossible to complete the printing as scheduled, thus postponing the publication. Unexpectedly, the power was suddenly reduced in late last month, and power was cut off again last week, causing the work to come to a standstill. The publication of this book has been postponed again. We are now trying to remedy the situation. We sincerely apologize and hope that those who have made reservations will forgive us.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Urgent Salt Problem <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Song Yuan</p>
<p>The high prices in the current city are the most serious problem for ordinary citizens, especially the daily necessities of food, the high prices of which are more threatening to our lives than all other goods. Food, vegetables, and fuel related to food have been solved by the public's attention and the authorities' attention, but the soaring price of salt seems to have not been paid attention to by all parties. Salt is an indispensable nutrient and vegetable seasoning for us every day. Its importance is no less than food, and salt has no suitable substitutes. According to the recent increase in salt prices, it has actually surpassed all other necessities of life; Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the black market price of salt in the city was about 20 yuan per catty, but in the past few days, it may not be possible to buy it for about 100 yuan. In this less than two months, the increase has been five times, which is also amazing.</p>
<p>My country has always adopted a state monopoly system of unified production and marketing of salt, so it is the earliest commodity with a controlled economic meaning in my country. In general, it is easier to implement the control and rationing of salt than all other commodities, but the facts tell us that although various important necessities of the city have been implemented by rationing according to the number of people, salt only has a ration card, but has never seen a formal rationing, which really makes people puzzled. This city is located on the coast, and the surrounding areas such as Songjiang, Huainan and Zhejiang are famous salt-producing areas in my country, and the raw materials for salt production are taken from the sea, or dried in the sun, or dried with reeds produced along the coast. The restriction reduces its output. Or it is said that the transportation is difficult and the source of salt is not smooth, but the distance from the city to the salt fields is not far, in addition to railways, ships, and highways, it can also be transported by private ships, and the problem is not so serious.</p>
<p>Salt is not only a daily necessity and seasoning for us, but also an important industrial raw material. The impact of its high price cannot be ignored. The prices of side dishes such as pickles, curd milk and pickles are also based on the price of salt. Therefore, in this rising salt price, the authorities should seek ways to suppress its price. In addition to the difficulties in the production and transportation of salt by the authorities responsible for the production and marketing of salt, it is also hoped that a large amount of salt can be allocated to the distribution office for goods to implement the fairest per capita distribution system as soon as possible, so that the salt problem of citizens can be rationally resolved. One more thing that deserves our attention is the source of black market salt. Although it has not been thoroughly investigated, the fact that most of them are smuggled salt that has not been taxed should be a fact. At this stage of the decisive victory in the war, the government's funding needs are very high, and tax increase has become an urgent task at present, and the government's funding needs are very high. It is also necessary to find ways to prevent such a huge tax source from leaking.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Children's Association Fundraising: Still Hoping for Donations from All Walks of Life <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The China Children's Relief Association is calling for donations from the society due to feeding difficulties. In recent days, people from all walks of life have been setting a century-old plan for the society, generously donating money, and enthusiastically donating money. Now a total of donations have been received, exceeding 400,000 yuan donated by leader Luo Hongyi, in response. It is true that "compassion is in the heart and love is in the arms." However, the association is aware that current prices are soaring, and 5 million yuan is not enough to maintain the education and living expenses of more than 300 refugee children for half a year. It is still hoped that warm-hearted gentlemen and ladies of the society will generously give Renjiang and do their best to lose, so that the funds of the association will be available and the work will not be interrupted. Then hundreds of orphans will be grateful to the sea.</p>
<p>If you would like to donate, in addition to the association's direct collection, the social service department of this newspaper can also collect it on its behalf. If you would like to donate by phone, you are especially welcome. Please call 82273, and the association will send someone to collect the donation with a receipt.</p>

<p>Mr. Chen Junxin wrote: "To whom it may concern, your newspaper has been running various charitable activities with excellent results, which is very admirable. When I enter the Yiren workshop, I have excess energy and detailed work. At the age of forty, it is a cheap day. I am very grateful to my relatives and friends. I was given a piece of Li and Yanghang's Yihua brand colored son's dress fabric, which has been sewn properly (length 1 foot 9 inches, waist 8 inches, sleeve length 2 feet 5 inches, cuff 6 inches). I originally planned to make it for myself, but then I realized that in these difficult times, there are countless people who are suffering from hunger and cold. What am I, who can wear this dress? Therefore, I plan to sell this fabric and set a price of 100,000 yuan. All the proceeds will be used for various good deeds in your newspaper. If some of it can be allocated to the Red Swastika Society for winter relief, it would be even better, because I am also a disciple of the society, otherwise, you can do whatever you want. The price of this fabric seems high, but according to the recent market conditions, I am afraid that it is not easy to buy it for this price. Now I am sending it with the letter. I hope you will accept it and publish the original letter, so that all the great philanthropists can help and support each other to do good deeds together." Mr. Chen's enthusiasm for charity is very admirable. In addition to displaying the gown fabric, we hope that enthusiastic people will actively bid for it and do more good deeds to maximize the effect of relief.</p>
