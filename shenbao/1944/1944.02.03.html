<p>社評</p>
<h3>縮小省區</h3>
<p>蘇淮特區已於一月十五日改為淮海省，特區行政公署亦於二月一日改為省政府。這是國府還都以後，實施縮小省區的第一聲。</p>
<p>縮小省區的主張。由來巳久，最重要的原因，約有三點：</p>
<p>行政上幅員過於遼闊，以致管理上不免有鞭長莫及之處。中國的省份，以新疆為最大，有五百餘萬方里，浙江為最小，有二十九餘萬方里。（民國二十五年申報年鑑據地質調查所調查）四川有一市一百四十八縣，一個設治局，河北有一百三十縣。就以江蘇而論，亦有三十二萬餘方里，管轄六十一縣，統治於一個省長之下。無論省長怎樣精明幹練，他的時間與精力無法貫注及於全省。猶如一個優良的教師，不能教導過多的學生一樣。教師教導學生，使個個成續良好，學生數量就不能不適當減少，傳學生與教師接觸的機會增多。同樣的，省長指揮和訓導縣長，都能稱職，也就不能不減少他所管理的縣長。</p>
<p>政治上區域過大，以致演成地方割據，道是封建思想的遺毒。大凡地方廣大，財賦兵馬之權，集於長官一人，每易啟發野心家的割據，造成尾大不掉之局，使中央無力控制。民國十六年以前的省長，督軍，巡閱使，民國十六年以後的省主席，綏靖主任，很多形成割據之局，踞地稱雄，抗不受命，國民受害不淺。</p>
<p>地理上達反天然疆界，不合國民風俗人情。現一中國的省區，大都承明淸的舊制，明叉承元代的藝制，目的沒有計及國民的經濟與文化。譬如河南河北之間，四川貴洲之間，省與省的疆界，很多不合天然，如犬牙之相錯。最明顯的就是江蘇，江南汪北人民風尚習俗，生活情況，經濟建設，逈不相同。人民的負担，當然不能一律，政府的協助更應分別輕重，庶幾各縣政治都能平均發展。</p>
<p>給小省區，無論對中央對地方對人民都有相當便利，所以從民國初年以來，政府方面，人民方面提出種種主張，但未見諸實行。現在淮海省的建立，可以說是還都後縮小省區的創始。</p>
<p>最後，我們認為縮小省區，增加新省，目的在便於施政，有利民生。絕非多添幾個省長，多添幾個省政府，而加重人民負担。有利民生的省政府，不必一定有　大的組織。省區縮小之後，省政府的組織與行政應當簡素化，省政府的行政經費亦不應增加。省政府與縣政府之間的聯絡吏趨緊密化。切實做到施政簡捷，有利民生的目的！</p>
<h3>日基於正義精神　期實現國際和平　首外相在貴院答議員質問</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電日貴院二日下午舉行預算總會時，議員建部逐吉會質問常局，對於大東亞戰爭之本義輿外交戰有何抱負？束條首相對此答稱：大東亞戰爭之不義，在維繫天地之公道。日本一億國民刻抱必勝之決心，縱遭遇如何困難，仍能為實現正義而繼續奮鬥，此為日本國民古來之傳統精神，日本國民於此種傳統下，抱勝利之決心，推進戰時之強力政策。然此項政策之推行，需要日本人之自肅，即國家與國家問之相交，亦須抱問樣之精神，藉期外交及其他諸施策益趨公明正大也。繼由重光外相起立答辭稱：日本所縱事之戰爭，係正義與不正養之戰爭，藉期徹底普及日本　國之理想，使無遺憾，不依據公道，顯渝國際芷義，固無待言；大東亞宣言，與敵英。美非理非道之戰爭目的，判若天　，日本基於正義精神，期實現國際之和平，並與志同遭合之盟邦及中立國親密，而共同邁進也。</p>
<h3>盡力協助中國　振興輕工業　靑木大臣答坂谷質問</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日靑木大東亞相，二日下午於貴院預算總會席上，答覆議員坂谷希子爵質問，關於華北食糧問題及如何振典輕工業之問題？謂此二者實具有同樣之性格，驚現在中國最感迫切者，乃物價及治安問題，此二者對獲得資源方面，實有重大影響，又根本問題在於增產，欲行增產，須首先予以拔術上之協力。目前華北甘薯增產力最大，現巳派專家赴該處從事指導工作。至於其他農作物之指導人員，亦由日本選派，又振典輕工業，亦為當前急務，蓋欲安定民生，除食糧以外，尚須確保生活必需品，對此日本方面亦決盡最大之努力，協助中國振興輕工業。</p>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日貫衆兩院對各　案之審議，其速度之快，寶超預想以上。如按此情勢推進，則衆議院之一切議案，於五日即可議畢。同時貴院亦與此相呼應，而順利進行。故此次議會預料至遲於七日左右。待貴衆兩院所有議案討論完畢後，即行閉會。又貴院今日未舉行全體會議，僅於上午十特召開預算總會，決算各分科會，赤字增稅各委員會。下午一時半召開育英委員會，同時衆議院亦未舉行全體會議，僅召　決算建議戰時保額等各委員會。十三時召開鐵道敷設法委員會。十四　召開海軍刑法委員會。</p>
<h3>日鋼鐵生產　獲良好成績</h3>
<p>東京二日中央社電　日鋼生產狀況，自去夏改為原料由國內自給以來，其成續頗為良好·即以昭和十八年度下半年度上半期之生產狀況觀之，雖於冬爭亦能遴劃期之增產給錄。同時下半年度下半期即本年一月之生產狀況，亦有優秀成績，由此故益信十九年度之生產情祝，定可飛躍進展，考其原因，乃由於去年六月以來能克服船舶之困難及由國內獲得自給之原料。鋼鐵統制會在下半年度上半期實施「冬季增產週」，打破往年冬季之減產現　，並工作人員之奮進，另一方面則由於軍需省及鋼鐵統制會等實施，　增加工作人員，　　鑛爐及冶鋼技術上之改進，　確保資材之來源等結果，故十八年度下半年度下半期能步人增產正軌。故吾人確信如依照十九年度鋼鐵增產計劃進行，定能獲得良好增產効果。</p>
<h3>張一鵬視察　首都兩法院</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　司法行政部長張一鵬氏，於昨二日下午二時，偕同刑務署長陳恩普等，蒞首都高地兩法院，暨高地兩檢察署視察。經喬院長錢檢察長，率領全體職員歡迎。張部長對於首都兩院，暨兩檢署情形，垂詢頗詳。並向全體職員訓話，語多勗勉。張氏視察各院署辦公室，暨看守所一週後返部。</p>
<h3>日文學使者　小林氏抵京</h3>
<p>南京二中央社電　日本評論家小林秀雄氏，護奉文學報　會命，來華專任日本文學報國會中國駐在員·上月　滬後，於三十日下午由滬來京，日來與各方聯絡，訓　甚為忙碌。記者以小林氏負有日本文化使者使侖，特趨前往訪，承發抒意見謂：余獲悉中國甚詳，及至即將召開第三次大東亞文學者大會之今日·余對盟邦中國之認識，更非書本中之理想所可比據。現奉命專任文學報國會之駐在員，因尚無具體頂定工作計劃，職務亦閒，今後將努力學習中國語，能閱讀中國書籍，亦為一大快事。雖然預定以六個月為限，以上海南京作駐在中心，但若可能，頗思遍走各地。聞小林氏將於今日（三日）粱夜車返滬。</p>
<h3>華北召開　宣傳會議</h3>
<p>北平二日中央社電　國府華北政務委員會，以現值大東亞戰爭勝利年，宣傳工作實有再加強化之必要。於二月四日五日兩日，在平召開三十三年度華北春季宜傳會議·該會已訓令華北各省市政府，及第一直轄行政區公署，屆時派各宣傳處長。及席行政區宜傳室主任，來平出。</p>

<h3>寒假學生生活營　舉行結營儀式　亁運實踐會正式成立</h3>
<p>南京二日中央社電　幹字運動寒假學生生活營，自成立以來，頗獲卓著成績。最近又協同首都消　總會寒假工作班，從事於京師吸毒售毒之探查。在豐富路及石相園破獲毒品批發處二所，查得大量白面及雅片，其於消毒總奮起運動，實有莫大貢獻。為鑒於離營後，繼續推動廣泛的靑年奮起遝動起見，該營已決組織幹字運動實踐會。二月一日下午三時，幹字運動實踐會，在石鼓路模範女中正式成立。蒞會者除該實踐會正會長林柏生氏，副會長許錫慶氏鐘任　氏，總幹事吳瑞氏外，並有京市大中各校校長，及代表龍沐動等多人，　談亁字實踐會今後實施之具體方針。商談約三小時之久，結果極為圓澆·是日晚，該營又舉行盛大之同樂實，以示惜別·陳中委襲君，及林夫人徐女土，均　雨蒞臨，陳中委為慰勞該營營員不懈之辛勞，以及其在社會各方面表現己卓著之成績，特賜八千元，以示嘉獎。林夫人亦講水果帶營　勞。當晚並有宜傳部派員放射時事電影，聯歡盛況，至為熱烈。二月二日十時，該營鄭重舉行結營議式。營長林柏生氏，副營長許錫優氏，模範女子中學校長　孟婉女士等皆出席。林營長於惜別依依中，勉勵該營員，勿以此為生活營之終結，而當視此為　開亁字運動更偉大工　之開始，故每一營員今後皆須發揚營中之優秀精神，在組織及思想方面，力求全體主義化。許副營長亦誠以幹與知不可分。最後全體高唱營歌，儀式終結·午間諸長官留營，與諸營員聚餐後，由林營長順次舉行握別式·全體營員於熱烈狂呼中·目送營長登車而去·</p>

<h3>蘇聯十六共和國參與國防外交案業　經蘇維埃最高會議通過</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　據莫斯科電：蘇聯外交人民委員莫洛托夫，於第十四屆蘇聯最高會議中提出各共和國之參與國防與外交權一案，經該會議亘四小時討論結果，將該案通過。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　第十次蘇聯最高會誰席上，曾提出使各共和國創設國防外務兩人民委員部，且賦與國防與外交權限之法案，該法案實為斯丹林根木修正憲法之表現，故各方對之均甚注目，美英兩國因與之有直接利害關係，故極惑不安。據莫斯科來電稱，莫洛托夫外務人民委員一日下午在最高會議席上，曾耍求通過以上法案，并稱，過去關於國防外務一切事項之掌管，均一任聯非人民委員部，今後於各共和國內均創設國防外務兩委員部，則今後十六共和國各有其獨立之軍隊，同時并可與諸外國自由樹立之外交關係，亦有自由締結條約之權限。</p>
<h3>波羅的國境爲中心蘇軍向三方面進展</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社鴛　德軍當局一日設明東錢戰況如次：北部戰綫蘇軍之攻勢，正向三方面進展，一為對愛沙尼亞國境東方之肯基基普，一為自北向盧加市南方，一為向諾伏格勒西方·刻蘇軍正於該三方面不分畫夜向西進學德軍陣地，現仍繼續激戰中。中部戰綫尼維爾區。維特勃斯克。勒契亞各地區之戰鬥規模漸已縮少，尤於普貝特河南方德軍曾排除蘇軍之頑強抵抗，繼續進攻，獲極大戰果。南部戰綫在舊波蘭國境之薩爾尼地區，蘇軍因德軍猛烈抵抗，巳放棄西進企國，銳鋒展開對羅威諾Rovno市之新攻勢。</p>
<p>瑞典京城二日中央社電　德軍現沿魯加河（南北貫流於愛沙尼亞國境附近）構築陣地，於摩納斯染伊爾捷及肯基塞普兩據點阻止蘇軍前進，到處展開壯烈之坦克車衝鋒戰，至一日情勢愈形緊迫，不得已而容許蘇軍進至該河西岸，德軍當局亦率直承認事態之重大，與蘇軍之優勢。蘇聯情報局一日發表公　稱：己佔領肯基塞普，即將向愛沙尼亞國境西方之那瓦開始攻勢。同時列寗格勒戰棧軍中央部隊與伏爾柯夫戰綫軍相呼應，漸次壓縮自　加北力四十公里之地芬斯卡亞，徑伏爾柯夫河西方卅公里之柳　，連結諾伏格勒西方六十公里巴迭卡亞之罵蹄型包圍陣·企圖於盧加對鎖　包　圈，德軍反攻極　熾烈，刻正展開空前之價耗戰。又自諾伏索科爾尼基西進之彼勃夫將軍所部第二波羅的戰綫軍，亦向拉脫維亞猛遊中，今戰局以彼羅的國境為中心，愈形緊迫云。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫晤寇爾長談</h3>
<p>安加拉二日中央社電　據海通社訊，莫斯科消息：蘇聯外交人民委員長莫洛托夫，昨日接見英駐蘇大使寇爾爵土，作長時問之會談。按寇爾提早消假，於星期日自倫敦返莫斯科任所。</p>
<h3>西班牙訓練海軍人材</h3>
<p>瑪德里二日中央社電　此問海軍學校昨日開始一新訓練課程，參加者有海陸空軍之部長及總參該部高級官員數人。典禮開始時，海長莫尼奧上將闡述該校造就海軍人材之重要任務。</p>
<h3>德對西班牙具絕大信心　必能維護國家尊嚴</h3>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　英美兩國官傳機關刻頻頻散佈西班牙與軸心絕交之謠言，但德外交富局一日正午發表稱：英美兩國宣傳機關早已散布該執流言，但西班牙政府始終堅持中立，決不能謂弗郎哥元首拋棄此種原則，故企圖或　西班牙政策者終歸失敗。</p>
<p>柏林二日中央社電　柏林政界評論西班牙對反軸心國家漸增加之政治壓力之基木態度稱，在西班牙歷史上，對於國家之光榮及尊嚴獨立之意願三者，乃發揮極重要之影響此弗郎哥將軍之西班牙時代此種原則亦復有效。故柏林方面相信凡一切破壞西班牙內政機構之企圖或威脅，終將歸於失敗。數世紀以來，國家之光榮及尊嚴已成西國之根基，此弗朗哥將軍自當採取同一之態度，且彼會領導西國於革命中回復至建設之境地，德方以為反軸心所傳西班牙將與軸心斷絕外交關係，實極荒謬之說法。自葡萄牙成為英美煽動之目標以來，柏林政界均抱薩拉柴總理必將以葡國之利益為重之信念·雖葡萄牙終於對英美作阿索爾羣島事件之讓步，但仍不影饗此種概括之推斷：柏林政界對反軸心致力於強迫中立國史改其熊度之事實，對瑞典之其種企圖亦屬於此類，均可以「擴展戰爭之範圍」之行動目的也。</p>
<h3>艾登宣言臨時作罷</h3>
<p>倫二日中央社電　德國新聞社訊，據交換電訊報外交訪員宜稱：英外相文登似將不發表各方期待早日得悉之有關英西關係之宣言，據稱，渠已獲得暗示，艾登閱讀英駐西大使霍爾之報吿後，即表示英政府倘於此時發表強硬之宣言，殊不合時宜</p>
<p>里斯本二日中央社美政府自禁止石汕輸入西班牙，業已蹬明英美兩國對西之外交壓迫及經濟壓迫更形激烈。查其用意，不外使西班牙參加反軸心陣營。然據英國某有力人士之觀測，認為西班牙之放棄中立並非易事。茲據倫敦之美聯社訊：</p>
<h3>西國限制汽油消費</h3>

<h3>阿京中立國評論家座談會</h3>
<p>古田特派員</p>
<p>羅斯福於十二月二十五日，曾無棧電廣播，公開聲稱「盡可能提前結束太平洋戰爭」。日木東條　相，比羅斯福還在以前，就指出，一九四四年為最後央　負的一年。從各方面的實際悄況看來，太平洋大戰的確將在今年內，得到一個明確的答案，這一點是全世界一致公認的事。就在這樣吃緊年的頭一天·請諸位不要拘泥於任何立塲·絕對開誡佈公地發表高見！</p>
<p>「有限戰爭」與「無限戰爭」</p>
<p>A氏　關於太平洋戰爭的時間性格，我想用馬寒和克勞責烏茲。教密尼等所說的「Limited　War（有限戰爭）」與「UnlimitedWar（無限戰爭）」之字限。日本一開始戰爭，就在西部太平洋和遠東沿海附近，迅速擴大了佔領區。然而日木在東部太平洋上，既沒有可守的屬地，所以就沒有必要再去佔領他人的土地。只是把既得的佔領區，需要建立起來铜墻　壓般的戰略姿態，也就是說首先爭取到所調內錢作戰的有利姿態，然後對於來攻的敵人，予以打擊，即所謂「出血作戰」就可以了。這一性格，是極其有限的。然而美國這樣作就不行。美國既然在西部太平洋上擁有屬地，而希冀在遠東一帶有大的發展，同時美國，既然恐懼日木的大東亞戰鑒姿態愈益強大，當然就要遙遠地從萬里地方派兵前來，不顧一切地向日木的防禦地帶一再進攻·換實之，美國不得不對日軍的「有限」進行「無限戰爭」，就是這個　理，同時，如不以人力物力的巨大消耗，不停地前進，則對美國是不行的。然而美國在表面上發揮着無限的戰力，逐漸衝入日本的防守地帶，達到高度咸脅日本的戰略姿熊時，則日本就必須放棄有限的性格，而再捲土重來，發動全面進攻。我所說的這種形態，芷反映着太平洋戰爭的經過，上述最後的决戰階段，即將在今年出現。我認為「一九四四年為太平洋的決戰年」，就是這個意思。</p>
<p>美國夢想中的進攻計</p>
<p>B：美國的對日攻勢，今年的確將達到最高峯。從發　勞面概略地來說，華軍的戰略，的確想控制日本本土，而收復菲律實。那末究竟怎樣進行呢？我認為美國的目標，在於控制和取得包括馬紹爾羣島（Mashall　lslands）及加羅林羣島（Caroline　lslands）的密克羅尼西亞羣島（Micronesina　Islands），以及其西北的馬利亞那羣島（Miriana　Islands）·密克羅尼西亞羣島中最令人注意者，是戞路特島（Jaluit　Island，坡納皮島（Ponape　Island）和特路克島（Truk　Island），然而特路克島只距離拉巴爾一千五百公里左右，假如美國攻下新小列顛島時，則特路克島即將投入美　飛機轟炸圈內，而成為赫爾采將軍攻勢的目標。另外，該羣島中的戞路特島，距敵中途島（Mid-wayIsland）的美國海軍根據地一千八百海里，而是在近代艦隊作戰的活動牛徑二千海里以內，且處於吉爾員特羣島美國航空根據地的轟炸圈內一千三百公里上，赫爾采將軍向時路克島開始大攻勢的時候，尼米茲將軍很有可能發動配合作戰，向戞路特進攻。再進一步，美國第二個目標，就會向馬利亞納羣島挺進。關島（Guam　Island）距離戛路特為一千二百海里，以關島為中心，至日本本土的橫濱為一千五百六十海里，至馬尼刺為一千七百三十海里。關島，就是鮑德溫所說的直搗日本本土和收復菲律賓，同時並進的主要根據地。自然，日木對抗這種偉大場面的進攻，就不能不展開空前驚人的不斷巨戰。這一驚心動魄的最後決戰，如日本萬一失敗，則上述美國的戰略，就立刻實現。</p>
<p>由蛙式跳島戰術轉變爲大擊動戰</p>
<p>C氏：美國假如收復關島，則將對日本本土實行最大的恐怖空襲，定會由關島直接進行，同時也將壓迫菲律濱，橫越中國南海，與巾國取得連絡；這種情形下的日木，不僅與南方圈的連絡將被切斷，同時絕對保險的東印度，也將有脫敵日本的危險。美國進行這種戰略的時候，不可疏忽者有下列兩點：</p>
<p>第一，當美國向兩洋進行突破作戰時，則會改變前此所採用的由所羅門島北上之蛙式跳島戰術，因為航空基地的距離關係，則不能充分發揮飛機的威力，所以進攻作戰的性格，就不能不加以改變，就是說，非專門依賴航空母艦中心主義的大機動部隊不可。當這種浩浩蕩蕩的大遠征時，無論從夏威夷也好，從　摩亞羣島（Samoa　Islands）也好，從中途島也好，甚至從新不列顛島（假定為美所佔領）也好，距離全都是數千海里的。這樣大的機動部隊，是否能從美國源源不斷地，且從四面八方地補充得來，誠為一大疑問。</p>
<p>美國自從眞珠瀐受到絕大損失以來，連續派出比較大規模的機動部隊這種事情，太平洋大戰二年期間，共總不過兩次。就是說，從一九四二年八月的首次所羅門海戰至十月二十六日的南太平洋海戰期間，為第一次；第二次就是一年後的一九四三年十一月·波根維爾，吉爾貝特等近海的海戰空戰時代。從另一方面來解釋，就是說，為了恢復眞珠灣的損失和創痕，曾需要八個月，恢復所羅門海戰的創痕，曾費去一年，一直到十一月，在彼根維爾和吉爾貝特才出現了偉大機動部隊。</p>
<p>第二應當注意的一點，就是這種大機動部隊出現的時候，可能受到的損失，將遠超過所羅門羣島與吉爾貝特羣島大戰的比例。因為日木補充路綫的縮短，美國補充路錢的延長，所以美國的損失，一定會逐漸擴大。</p>
<p>美國生產力「限界」的周期性</p>
<p>D氏：歸根結底，問題是央定於美國的生產力。換言之，美國生產力今年業已達到登峰造極的最高點，是否客觀條件永久允許這樣順利地下去，實在都是問題。一般人常喜歡說的美國生產力的「限界」，實際情形究竟怎樣呢？</p>
<p>一九四三年度的預定生產額為七百五十萬萬金元，結果降為六百五十萬萬金元，終是普通人都在暄嚷，這就是「限界」，然而不要忘記的是這一「限界」，决不是固定不變的。必須注意到，一個限界住往產生另一類限界的發展。在這一意義上及檢討一下過去的二年歷史就可以知道。太平洋戰爭爆發後，一直至一九四二年八月，以突飛猛進的姿態，生產曾直綫地上騰着。如以一九四〇年下半期的生產量為一百，則八月竟達到三百六十一的比例。於是人力物力方面，竟達到最高的限界。後來至十二月，這個八月的三百六十一的數字，並未發生變化，且在這個期問專心為了突破這一限界，曾煞費苦心地調整人力物力資源。這一點曾見之於一九四二年十一月，十二月軍需資材比例制的變更，勞動力分配的修改等。這樣一來，第一次的「限界」竟被突破，只耍看一下飛機生產量也就可以知道，正月為五千架，四月爲六千架五月竟達七千二百架。接着又來了一種「限界」。例如六月為七千架，七月為七千三百七十三架，八月為七千六百十二架，九月為七千五百九十八架，反而稍微倒退了。當時又曾絞腦榨汁地實行過調整國內戰綫。於是這一努力，又突破了第二個「限界」。十月的飛機生產量，竟開八千三百六十二架的新紀錄，十一月又造成八千七百八十九架的飛躍發展，比較九月，竟增加了一千一百八十一架。這樣看來，九月和十月所寶現的「限界」，再繼續不久，一定還會重要再突破這一新的「限界」，然而這一限界的突破，將逐漸碰到許多困難和艱苦·總之，生產力限界雖是循環的局期性，然而逐漸造成的錯綜複雜「限界」，美國是否還能突破，今後將成一大問題。</p>
<p>B氏　方才的話中最感興味者，就是生產力的頂點與美國攻勢的關聯性。一九四一年八月，生產力達到最初的「高潮」時，便促成美國於瓜達卡那爾島登陸，而寶行所羅鬥羣島的反攻·一九四三年六月的生產力「頂點」，便促成美國於新佐治亞，新幾內亞，倫特巴等島，進行總反攻。同年十月和十一月的第三次頂點，便促成美國於渡根維爾，吉爾貝特，繼而新不列顛，開始反攻。羅斯福的作戰方法，起碼想在今年决一勝負，所以為了克服今年度的「限界」，想最高度地擴充所有原料和勞力的羅斯福，於十二月二十五日，曾說過用「破釜沉舟」的辦法來擊潰日本，這句話是值得認眞討論一下的。</p>
<p>美國四面八方的神出鬼沒戰術　古田特派員</p>
<p>據說，羅斯福「將從太平洋的東西南北，四面八方開始發動攻勢。</p>
<p>E氏　這是指從阿留申向千島登陸，從中國大陸發動綿豆數千里的大攻勢，蓋特巴頓在印度洋向緬甸的攻勢，從美國木土而向日本本土的飛機轟炸等。</p>
<p>諾伐利斯君（阿根廷著名海軍評諭家）曾說過，最近福電契爾中將伴隨北太平洋一帶的海軍司令，很明確地最加公路，而積極集中大批特殊部隊，艦艇，以及軍需品等。</p>
<p>美國陸軍航空部隊的著名智勇雙全的戰略家，仲松（Jonson），業已就任阿拉斯加航空隊司令，這一點是大可實視的。塞維爾斯基等所高唱入雲的由美國木土空襲日本，這也決不是虛張聲勢的空頭支票，的確有認眞加以討諭的價值，同時決不要忽視成層圈飛行的戰爭出現，而更不能不戒備美國B29型等超長題離轟炸機的試驗成功。總而言之，特別不能不注意者，就是美國的戰路，決非千篇一律，墨守成規的。</p>
<p>C氏　還有在錫蘭島虎視眈眈，躍躍欲戰的蒙特巴頓。</p>
<p>南洋圈直接攻擊的可能性</p>
<p>A氏　雖然如此，但美國的戰鬥力也有其木身的限度，同時也有其「重心」。攻擎重心究竟將在什麼地方呢？我個人認為將是南方圈。就是方才所說的，與其以大量時間和犧牲來採取中部的進攻策略，藉以收復非律演，切斷日木與南方圈的交通統，倒莫如直接佔領南方圈本身，因爲在消耗方面不僅大可以減少，同時在時間方面，也可以縮短。那末進攻南方圈，究竟將採取那一條路綫呢？我認為一定是澳洲北部和新幾內亞西部中間的亞拉佛拉海（Arafura　Sea）和帝摩爾海（Timor　Sea）·美國在這一海面上，可以最大限度地利用新幾內亞的摩勒斯巴港（Port　Meresby）梅勞開，以及最近和悉微尼（Sydney）舖設上鐵路交通的達爾文港（Daiwin）一帶基地，恰如在所羅門羣島所採用的蛙式跳島戰法，而向北推進，由密卡利（Myeale）而阿盧（Aru　Eslands）而法義（Kel　Islands）·而蒂尼索爾·而塔寗巴爾，而知茂拉聿羣島（Timor　Laut　Island）。優點就是能够兼用航空根據地的飛機威力與機動部隊，且比較其他進攻路纔，可以免去補充綫的拖長毛病。這一條進攻路綫，既有這樣大的長處，是值得特別加以注意的。</p>
<p>同時，我們還可以絕對想像得到，蒙特巴頓會配合這一作戰的，他既有現在的雄厚勢力，而再得到船隻的大量增援，然後就由尼古巴群島（Nicator　Islands）和安達曼群島（Auda　Man　Islands），向蘇門答臘（Sumatra）和馬來亞進攻。</p>
<p>C氏：　問題仍然還是在於日本的生產，是否能夠經常按着一定的對比，迫隨得上突飛猛進的美國生產力的發展。能夠追得上美國的生產力，則有不敗的希望，否則，就不堪設想了。現在一般人都在談質與量的問題，然而只有質，或只有量，這是不能致勝的，非二者兼備不可。按以前的例來說，日本海的東鄕艦隊比較波羅的海的俄國艦隊，在質上說，是遠勝一籌的，而在量上說，是分不出上下來的，所以日本獲勝。一九四〇年德國在西歐的閃電作戰，在質的方面曾極度優秀，而在量的方面，也曾佔絕對的優勢，這就是德國迅速致勝的原因。日本欲想以一九四四年爲「勝利年」，不外拼命提高國內的生產力，保持住日本軍的强悍性，對於孤注一擲來攻的美軍，加以當頭痛擊如是方可。（大　　一月七日讀書報知）</p>

<h3>上海染織布廠當前之危機</h3>
<p>— 暁</p>
<p>我國工業素稱落後，晚近十數年來，經朝野人士之努力擘劃經營，然亦僅輕工業略具雛形，中以染織布廠業進展尤速。八一三時，因廠址大半地處滬西閘北，深受打擊，戰事西移，各廠賈其餘勇，重整旗鼓，當時國積之風未熾，有資者樂於投資，實業金融界亦刀加維護，舊存者固無處夭折，新興者如雨後春筍。蓋以年來舶來品漸形絕跡，國產棉布更獲暢銷，染織布廠深得發展機會。截至去年爲止，上海一地之染織布廠，已有一千三百餘家，生產數量日有增加，使用職工亦在十萬人以上，設產銷能圓滑配合，其有利於戰事經濟，實非淺尠。去年八月收買紗布法令頒佈後，此一千三百餘家之染織布廠，同為懲治國　而遭池魚之厄，當時各廠除暫行停工外，將所存原紗及成品悉數依限向商統會申請出賣，此種捐棄自私犧牲小我之精神，足顯大。</p>
<p>染織布廠之紗布，既已申請出賣，應得價款一時又未獲具領，因是資金運用失調，生產全部停頓，職工生活無法維特。其時中儲銀行曾一度允予貸款教濟，卒因種種關係，此項貸款仍成泡影。數月以來，坐守機器，空興仰屋，宣吿閉歇者日有所聞，少數資力較厚者，尚勉强維持，匯冀原料配給早日實現·下擬籌劃復工，以維職工生計之際，突受電力限制，不靑雪上添霖，復蘇之望又成夢幻，倘再無適當救濟辦法，則整個染織布廠業之前途，誠不堪設想矣！</p>
<p>政府在戰時統制人民物資·東西各國莫不皆然，但統制含強制性，治標而不能洽木，必須輔以增加生產。故汪主席對全國經濟委員會第三次會議席上訓辭中，於增產問題言之綦詳。夫增產實爲當務之急，不獨染織布廠為然，特染織布廠之崩潰迫於眉睫，不僅十萬職工將失依恃，即國家經濟基礎，恐亦爲之動搖。亟望今後收買紗布之給價辦法，能加調整，原料配給　速實現，工廠電力寬放限制·即從保護生產與培養生產上做起，以達到增加生產目的，庶不負汪主席昭示今年之謂增產年焉。</p>
<h3>鄕長不法勒捐</h3>
<p>— 鐘承沐</p>
<p>讀本壇二十二日浮收田賦一文，念及吾邑亦有同樣情事，且較洋涇區更為黑暗。誅常州各鄉區鄉長，假借名義，每畝勒派軍稻捐一百元至四百元。（有處則為稻四十斤至八十斤）全縣田額以二百萬畝計，扯計在四萬萬元以上，尚有其他經臨月捐不在其內。農產收入不數所出，鄉民有如倒懸，查盟邦棌辦軍稻，向來給價。今在軍稻之外，另立軍稻捐名義，挨戶勒派，而不價值。（有處帶同武奘警察挨戶強收）農民迫於浮威，雖怨擊載道，然敢怒而不敢言也。長此強暴榨取，年甚一年，農村崩潰，國木動搖，莫此為甚。務請政府當局及盟邦機關，對於此事稍加注意，嚴懲貧污，以解民困。一方則有賴吾邑同胞與政府合作，將各區鄉長之劣行證據，彙契吿潑，庶幾一般犯贓公務員，不難肅淸，團農民幸甚！國家幸甚！</p>

<h3>因金交復業之謠</h3>
<p>因金交復業之謠，過去兩天中的上海金融市塲，又呈山雨欲來之勢，而其影響所及，則得於兩種情熊中窺見一斑，其一為烚赤售價之一度狂漲，其一為股票市塲之忽趨下游；按能平昔的市場動態，烚赤售價一漲，百物隨以上漲，股價亦不能例外；今次烚赤售價之漲，則在百物價格狂漲之餘，而且並不能刺激股票價格上漲；反之，在烚赤漲價聲中，新上市的二十五種股票，竟有幾種一無成交者，此種情形，　為前此所未有，而其理由則在於以黃金為囤積投機之對象者，又至靜極思動之時期，循至造成人人爭先恐後，競購黃金之形態，其影響所及，固不僅股票市塲而已。</p>
<p>財政當局既經正式表示金交復業絕無其事，日並無此項考慮，則金交復業謠言所造成之市場動態，自可逐步消散了；可是，目前競購黃金之風，殊屬一種錯誤的觀念，因為我國貨幣早已與黃金脫離關係，即戰後之大東亞金融圈裏面，亦沒有恢復金木位之可能；大家為着解決游資之歸宿，與其囤積這樣一種『饑不可食，寒不可衣」的廢物，何如投資於各種生產事業，籍以繁榮增產時代的大衆生活狀態，豈不是於己於人，交相有利嗎？</p>
<h3>銀錢業實行緊縮貸放款　銀聯會審愼同業拆借</h3>
<p>銀錢兩業各行莊，為協助各業增進生產起見，恢復貸款後，悉依前頒放款新辦法及財部限制放款辦法辦理，聞對於承偕人不論抵押與信用，均一致特別審慎，所以各匯劃錢莊上市後，對往來透支摺子，暫以老戶信用素者者為限，各新戶欲請求貸款，頗非易事，同時銀行聯合準備會及錢業準備庫對會員行莊之提供低保品拆借，亦一　緊縮，並須說明正當用途，再予酌量核借，因此整個銀根在緊縮放款聲中趨緊，例如錢業市場拆息，以往每屆上市之初，恒為白借，最高亦不過數分，今年上市第一日為一角二分，繼即升至一角五分至二角，足證行莊同業間互拆銀根很緊，至於各行莊貸放款利息，仍在月息三分以上，此種情形，寶為杜絕投機囤積預防物價暴漲之好現象。</p>
<h3>跌難漲不易華股暫如盤境新上市各股交易俱盛</h3>
<p>昨華股轉入盤境，先種後回，午刻復轉堅定，下午場外價更挺，終各業股漲多跌少；各方人心雖於前日已止疫轉堅，然大多仍限於銀根，未能任意活動。百貨業永安公司本見盤平，下午升至二百二十四五元，國貨升十一元，下午則回小至一百五十七元；紡織股永安紗廠下午升至二百十一二元，統益再升十二元牛，美亞·內衣等堅定，絲業已見回下，景福衫襪下午升至三十八元，反跌為漲；新藥業呆平少變化；化工股，鈣奶生與中國奶粉步升，文化股中華不動，世界書局一哄升十元，下午再升至一百四十四元；公用股最為平定；地產業泰山升一元二角半，下午升至十五元，成交暢旺；實業股僅利亞·大中華實業微挺，久安等均見回下；標準珠粉升半元。今誌午刻收盤價於後。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田贊雄著　洪羊譯</p>
<p>軍人班（九）</p>
<p>秋也深了，同時軍人班的發舊用功，也加速度地進展着。但是，從十一月八日以後的數天中間，在他們的精神上，受了很大的衡動，時常要離開他們的書桌的。</p>
<p>八日的正午，桅檣上高懸着天黃旗的比額軍艦，在櫻島南水道，出現了他的雄姿。街路兩旁·自大臣·知事以下·奉迎的軍隊，鄕軍，各學校的學生等擁擠着。二中的學生，是在石燈籠大街附近，奉迎聖駕。</p>
<p>大元帥陛下，親臨統率自十一月九日起四日間，在　崎縣的山賽舉行的路軍特別大演習。大演贊後，行　宮崎縣內各處、十五日行幸鹿兒　縣內各處後，還關於行宮的第一高等女學校。</p>
<p>鹿見島市內，因拜迎聖駕，確是難得遇着的光榮事情，所以地方人民的欣喜雀躍的情感，好像沸協烈火似的奔騰着。在那天晚上，舉行了市內各學校男生一萬二千餘名的提燈遊行。偵人同隆天·也參加在大島先生指揮下的隊中。</p>
<p>並且在十七日·本縣以外五個縣的代表學生，同在鄉軍人，消防班等，在伊敷綀兵塲，飲賜閱兵。二中的上級學生，也一問沐受了這光榮。</p>
<p>前天下起的雨也晴了。是秋高氣爽的天空。市外北方的伊數村，在農戶人家，有紅的柿子樹，黃的菊花，門口都褂府赤心白地的日羣旗。這們美號日子的印象，筆者現介紹偵人自己來發表　。在二中校友會雜誌的行幸紀念號中，有他的一篇作文。</p>
<p>拜受御親閲　四年級　谷眞人</p>
<p>「立正！」的喇叭高聲地饗着，數萬的赤子，胸中充溢着赤誠，端正姿勢，正視着王座後方的國旗，被過午的日光映照　着，徐徐地昇起來了。（中略）不久贊輿即在國歌吹奏裏。好像滑走一般地到達了會塲（中略）瞻仰天額於咫尺的眼前，誠敬誠恐地行了最敬禮·不久·軍衆隊吹奏着進行曲，就開始了分列行進式，我們靑年的意氣，得義現於御前的時刻到了。我們像要踏破大地似的往前行進着。到御前的時候，下了一注目一的號令。得瞻仰天顏於咫尺之間的光榮，並且還賜答禮。此種光榮·不禁感激得淚珠都要落下來。</p>
<p>在心中堅誓着「將來定作陛下忠良的軍人！」而通過了玉座之前。如是分列行進終了，回到元來的位置。而且……（後略）</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>偵人們一面回憶那天的光榮，一面又開始他們軍人班的猛用功的時候，學校裏發生了一個新的事件。</p>
<p>「據說河田校長要轉任到一中去……」這們風聞，像野火一般傅逼了全學校·一·二年級生，並沒感到有甚麼影響，但是在三四年級生，以爲這是學校中的一件大事，都感到一種異常的衝勸和激憤。</p>
<p>「先生·這話是偵的麼？」</p>
<p>偵人這樣的向緒方先生詢間着。先中却現着一副尷尬的而孔，只沉默地將頭點了一下。</p>
<p>質人從　天以後，巳經失去了他那可愛的笑顏。事件的偵相，是一中的校長轉任他校，所以他的後任依序以二中校長來補充，這是極合乎常識的，縣署常局的人事更動。可是偵人是不懂那道理。並且自己心中唯一對象的「母校」，更深切地在他目前出現了。</p>
<p>「我絕對不贊成道種事情！」</p>
<p>一向是很溫和的價人，突然發出這種粗暴的言論，學友們都爲他吃驚了。然而，吃驚的學友們，和所有的學生同窗的學生，父兄會，甚至於敎師們，俱都捲人了悲憤慷慨的漩渦中去了。</p>
<p>從來鹿兒島，是對於感謝師恩特別篤厚的地方，私立學校和西鄉舉兵的關係，便是最大的例證，此次雖然沒有那樣的大壘動，但是情感的熱烈，彷彿是依然沒有變更。在敎師和麼生之中，已經有宜言退學的。事實上從河田校長到任以來，校風同學績，都大爲發揚，這是十目所視，十手所指的。</p>

        <h1>1944.02.03</h1>
<h3>Reducing Provincial Areas</h3>
<p>The Su-Huai Special District was changed to Huaihai Province on January 15th, and the administrative office of the special district was also changed to the provincial government on February 1st. This is the first step in implementing the reduction of provincial areas since the National Government returned to the capital.</p>
<p>The idea of reducing provincial areas has been around for a long time. The most important reasons are roughly threefold:</p>
<p>Administratively, the territory is too vast, inevitably leading to management shortcomings. Among Chinese provinces, Xinjiang is the largest, with over five million square li, while Zhejiang is the smallest, with over twenty-nine thousand square li. (According to the Geological Survey in the 1936 Shenbao Yearbook). Sichuan has one city, one hundred and forty-eight counties, and one administrative bureau; Hebei has one hundred and thirty counties. Even Jiangsu has over three hundred and twenty thousand square li, governing sixty-one counties, all under one governor. No matter how capable a governor is, their time and energy cannot be fully devoted to the entire province. It's like an excellent teacher who cannot teach too many students. To ensure good results for each student, the number of students must be appropriately reduced, increasing contact between students and teachers. Similarly, for a governor to effectively direct and instruct county magistrates, the number of magistrates they manage must be reduced.</p>
<p>Politically, overly large regions can lead to local separatism, a remnant of feudal ideology. Generally, when a region is vast, the power over finances and military affairs is concentrated in one official, which easily sparks the ambition of separatists, creating a situation where the tail wags the dog, making it difficult for the central government to control. Before 1927, provincial governors, military governors, and inspection commissioners, and after 1927, provincial chairmen and pacification commissioners, often formed separatist regimes, dominating their territories, defying orders, and causing great harm to the people.</p>
<p>Geographically, the boundaries contradict natural boundaries and are incompatible with national customs and sentiments. Most of China's current provincial areas follow the old systems of the Ming and Qing dynasties, which in turn inherited the institutions of the Yuan dynasty, without considering the people's economy and culture. For example, between Henan and Hebei, and between Sichuan and Guizhou, the boundaries between provinces often do not align with natural features, like interlocking teeth. The most obvious example is Jiangsu, where the customs, lifestyles, and economic development of the people in Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) are completely different. The people's burdens should not be uniform, and the government's assistance should be differentiated according to needs, so that the politics of each county can develop evenly.</p>
<p>Smaller provincial areas are considerably convenient for the central government, local areas, and the people. Therefore, since the early years of the Republic, various proposals have been put forward by both the government and the people, but they have not been implemented. The establishment of Huaihai Province can be said to be the beginning of reducing provincial areas after the return to the capital.</p>
<p>Finally, we believe that the purpose of reducing provincial areas and increasing new provinces is to facilitate administration and benefit the people's livelihood. It should not simply add more governors and more provincial governments, thereby increasing the burden on the people. A provincial government that benefits the people's livelihood does not necessarily need to have a large organization. After the reduction of provincial areas, the organization and administration of the provincial government should be simplified, and the administrative expenses of the provincial government should not be increased. The connection between the provincial government and the county governments should be strengthened. It is essential to achieve the goals of simple administration and benefiting the people's livelihood!</p>
<h3>Based on the Spirit of Justice, Japan Aims to Achieve International Peace: Foreign Minister Answers Questions from Assembly Members in the House</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – During the general budget meeting held in the Japanese House of Peers on the afternoon of the 2nd, Assembly Member Tatebe Tsukuyoshi asked the current administration about its ambitions for the fundamental meaning of the Greater East Asia War and diplomatic warfare. Prime Minister Tojo Hideki replied that the justice of the Greater East Asia War lies in maintaining the universal principles of heaven and earth. The 100 million people of Japan are determined to win and will continue to strive to realize justice, no matter the difficulties encountered. This is the traditional spirit of the Japanese people from ancient times, and under this tradition, the Japanese people are determined to win and advance the powerful wartime policies. However, the implementation of these policies requires the self-restraint of the Japanese people. The interaction between nations must also embrace the same spirit, in order to make diplomacy and other policies more fair and just. Subsequently, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru rose to answer, stating that the war that Japan is engaged in is a war between justice and injustice, aimed at thoroughly spreading the ideals of the Japanese Empire without regret. It goes without saying that Japan does not base its actions on injustice or deviate from international integrity. The Greater East Asia Declaration is as different as heaven and earth from the irrational and unrighteous war aims of the enemy, Britain and America. Based on the spirit of justice, Japan aims to achieve international peace, and will work closely with allied nations and neutral countries that share the same aspirations to move forward together.</p>
<h3>Making Every Effort to Assist China in Revitalizing Light Industry: Minister Aoki Answers Questions from Viscount Sakatani</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, in response to questions from Viscount Sakatani Hiroshi regarding the food situation in North China and how to revitalize light industry, stated at the budget committee of the House of Peers on the afternoon of the 2nd that these two issues are essentially of the same nature. The most pressing issues facing China now are commodity prices and public order, both of which have a significant impact on securing resources. The fundamental problem lies in increasing production, and to increase production, it is necessary to provide technical assistance first. Currently, North China has the greatest potential for increasing sweet potato production, and experts have already been dispatched there to provide guidance. Technical personnel for other agricultural crops will also be selected and sent by Japan. Furthermore, revitalizing light industry is also an urgent task, as it is necessary to ensure the supply of daily necessities in addition to food in order to stabilize people's livelihoods. Japan is determined to make the greatest effort to assist China in revitalizing light industry.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The speed at which both houses of the Japanese Diet are deliberating on various bills is exceeding expectations. If the current momentum continues, all bills in the House of Representatives are expected to be deliberated on by the 5th. The House of Peers is also proceeding smoothly in coordination with this. Therefore, it is expected that the Diet will adjourn no later than around the 7th, after all bills in both houses have been discussed. The House of Peers did not hold a plenary session today, but only convened budget and settlement subcommittees, and deficit and tax increase committees in the morning. The Education Committee was convened at 1:30 PM. The House of Representatives also did not hold a plenary session, but only convened committees on settlement recommendations and wartime insurance amounts. The Railway Construction Law Committee was convened at 1:00 PM, and the Naval Criminal Law Committee at 2:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Japan Achieves Good Results in Steel Production</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since Japan switched to relying on domestic sources for raw materials for steel production last summer, its performance has been quite good. Looking at the production situation in the second half of Showa 18 (October 1943-March 1944) and the first half of Showa 19 (April-September 1944), even during the winter, it was able to achieve the planned increase in production. Furthermore, the production situation in the second half of the second half (January 1945) also shows excellent results. This further strengthens the belief that steel production in Showa 19 (1944-1945) will make rapid progress. The reason for this is that it has been able to overcome shipping difficulties and obtain raw materials from domestic sources since June of last year. The Steel Control Association implemented a "Winter Increase Production Week" in the first half of the second half, breaking the trend of reduced production in winter in previous years. With the hard work of the staff, on the other hand, due to the implementation by the Ministry of Military Affairs and the Steel Control Association, increasing staff, improving furnace and steelmaking technology, and ensuring the source of materials, the second half of the second half of Showa 18 was able to step onto the right track of increased production. Therefore, we are confident that if we proceed according to the Showa 19 steel production increase plan, we will definitely achieve good production increase results.</p>
<h3>Zhang Yipeng Inspects the Two Capital Courts</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Minister of Judicial Administration Zhang Yipeng, accompanied by Warden Chen Enpu and others, visited the two capital high and local courts and the two high and local prosecutor's offices in the capital at 2 PM yesterday afternoon. President Qiao and Chief Prosecutor Qian led all the staff to welcome them. Minister Zhang inquired in detail about the situation of the two courts and the two prosecutor's offices. He also gave a speech to all the staff, offering much encouragement. After inspecting the offices of each court and prosecutor's office, as well as the detention center, Zhang returned to his ministry.</p>
<h3>Japanese Literary Envoy, Mr. Kobayashi, Arrives in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Japanese critic Hideo Kobayashi, entrusted with a mission by the Literary Patriotic Association, has come to China to serve as the resident representative of the Japanese Literary Patriotic Association in China. After arriving in Shanghai last month, he came to Nanjing from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 30th. He has been very busy contacting various parties these days. As Kobayashi carries the mission of a Japanese cultural envoy, the reporter made a special trip to visit him. He expressed his views, saying: "I have learned a great deal about China, and as we approach the Third Greater East Asia Writers' Conference, my understanding of our allied nation of China is not comparable to the ideals found in books. Now that I am entrusted with the mission of the resident representative of the Literary Patriotic Association, I have no concrete work plan and my duties are rather free. I will strive to learn Chinese in the future, and it would be a great pleasure to be able to read Chinese books. Although the assignment is expected to be limited to six months, with Shanghai and Nanjing as the center of my stay, I would very much like to travel around if possible." It is heard that Kobayashi will return to Shanghai by overnight train today (the 3rd).</p>
<h3>North China Convenes Propaganda Conference</h3>
<p>Beiping, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The North China Political Affairs Committee of the National Government believes that as we are now in the year of victory in the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to further strengthen propaganda work. It will convene the North China Spring Propaganda Conference for the 33rd year of the Republic (1944) on February 4th and 5th in Beiping. The committee has instructed the provincial and municipal governments of North China, as well as the first directly administered administrative region, to send their propaganda section chiefs and administrative region propaganda office directors to Beiping to attend.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Construction Drafts Production Increase Plan</h3>
<p>Hangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – As the Agricultural Production Increase Conference to be held in Nanjing on February 9th is approaching, the Zhejiang Department of Construction has specially drafted a plan to increase agricultural production in Zhejiang Province for discussion at the conference. Director Feng and section chiefs will go to Nanjing to attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Meeting</h3>
<p>Guangzhou, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Guangdong Provincial Government held its 47th provincial administration meeting yesterday, discussing important cases, excerpts of which are as follows: (1) Approved changing the pig and cattle slaughter tax rate in various counties and cities to three per cent of the value. (2) Approved the Provisional Measures for the Work Performance Evaluation of Labor Recruitment in Guangdong Province. (3) Approved the Provisional Rules for Earth Products Business and the Measures for Restriction of Import and Export.</p>
<h3>Winter Vacation Student Life Camp Holds Closing Ceremony: Practical Action Society Officially Established</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The Gan Zi Movement Winter Vacation Student Life Camp has achieved remarkable results since its establishment. Recently, it has also cooperated with the capital's Anti-Opium Association Winter Vacation Work Team to investigate drug use and trafficking in Nanjing. It has uncovered two wholesale locations for drugs on Fengfu Road and Shixiangyuan, seizing large quantities of heroin and opium, making a significant contribution to the general anti-opium movement. In view of the need to continue to promote a broad-based youth movement after the camp concludes, the camp has decided to organize a Gan Zi Movement Practical Action Society. On February 1st at 3 PM, the Gan Zi Movement Practical Action Society was officially established at the Model Women's Middle School on Shigu Road. In addition to the president of the Practical Action Society, Mr. Lin Baisheng, vice presidents Mr. Xu Xiqing and Mr. Zhong Renqiu, and executive director Mr. Wu Rui, many principals and representatives of universities and middle schools in Nanjing, such as Long Mumu, attended the meeting to discuss the specific policy for the Gan Zi Practical Action Society’s future implementation. The discussions lasted for about three hours and were very satisfactory. On the evening of the same day, the camp held a grand farewell party to express their parting sentiments. Central Committee Member Chen Xijun and Madam Xu, wife of Lin, attended. Central Committee Member Chen awarded 8,000 yuan to reward the camp members for their tireless efforts and remarkable achievements in various aspects of society. Madam Lin also brought fruit to express her appreciation for the camp members' hard work. In the evening, the Propaganda Department sent personnel to show current affairs films, and the festive atmosphere was very lively. At 10 AM on February 2nd, the camp solemnly held a closing ceremony. Camp Director Lin Baisheng, Deputy Camp Director Xu Xiyou, and Model Women's Middle School Principal Meng Wan attended. In his farewell speech, Camp Director Lin encouraged the camp members not to regard this as the end of the life camp, but to see it as the beginning of a greater effort to launch the Gan Zi Movement. Therefore, each camp member must carry forward the camp's excellent spirit and strive for collectivism in organization and thought. Deputy Camp Director Xu also sincerely stated that Gan and Zhi (knowledge and action) are inseparable. Finally, the entire group sang the camp song, and the ceremony concluded. At noon, the leaders stayed at the camp and had lunch with the camp members. Camp Director Lin then held a farewell handshake ceremony. All the camp members watched the camp director board the car and leave amidst enthusiastic cheers.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union's Sixteen Republics Participate in National Defense and Diplomacy; Proposal Passed by the Supreme Soviet</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Moscow dispatch: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov proposed at the 14th session of the Supreme Soviet a proposal for the participation of the republics in national defense and diplomacy rights. After four hours of discussion, the meeting passed the proposal.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – At the 10th session of the Supreme Soviet, a bill was proposed to enable each republic to establish People's Commissariats for National Defense and Foreign Affairs, and to grant national defense and diplomatic powers. This bill is an expression of Stalin's fundamental revision of the Constitution, so all parties are paying close attention to it. The United States and Britain are particularly disturbed because they have a direct interest in it. According to dispatches from Moscow, Foreign Commissar Molotov asked at the Supreme Soviet session on the afternoon of the 1st to pass the above bill, and stated that in the past, all matters related to national defense and foreign affairs were managed by the Federal People's Commissariat. In the future, National Defense and Foreign Affairs Commissariats will be established in each republic. In the future, each of the sixteen republics will have its own independent army, and at the same time, it will be able to freely establish diplomatic relations with foreign countries and have the right to freely conclude treaties.</p>
<h3>Centered on the Baltic Border, Soviet Forces Advance in Three Directions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German military authorities announced the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 1st as follows: The Soviet offensive on the northern front is advancing in three directions: one towards Kengisepp, east of the Estonian border, one southward from the north towards the city of Luga, and one westward towards Novgorod. Soviet forces are advancing westward day and night on these three fronts against the German positions, and fierce fighting continues. On the central front, the scale of battles in the areas of Nevel, Vitebsk, and Loknya has gradually decreased. In particular, south of the Pubeit River, German forces have overcome stubborn Soviet resistance and continued to attack, achieving great results. On the southern front, in the Sarny region on the old Polish border, Soviet forces have abandoned their attempt to advance westward due to fierce German resistance and launched a new offensive against the city of Rovno.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German forces are now constructing positions along the Luga River (which runs north-south near the Estonian border) and are blocking the Soviet advance at the strongholds of Muna, Narva-Ilgüz and Kengisepp. Fierce tank battles are taking place everywhere. The situation became increasingly urgent on the 1st, and it was unavoidable to allow Soviet forces to advance to the west bank of the river. The German authorities frankly admitted the seriousness of the situation and the Soviet advantage. The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 1st that it had occupied Kengisepp and was about to launch an offensive towards Narva, west of the Estonian border. At the same time, the central units of the Leningrad front army and the Volkhov front army are gradually compressing the area 40 kilometers north of Luga, Finskaya, and 30 kilometers west of the Volkhov River, Lyuban, linking the horseshoe-shaped encirclement of Padeka, 60 kilometers west of Novgorod, in an attempt to encircle and annihilate the German forces at Luga. The German counterattacks are extremely fierce, and an unprecedented war of attrition is underway. Furthermore, the 2nd Baltic Front Army under General Popov, advancing westward from Novosokolniki, is also fiercely attacking Latvia.

<h3>Molotov Meets with Kerr for a Long Talk</h3>
<p>Ankara, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuter dispatch from Moscow: Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Archibald Clark Kerr yesterday for a long conversation. Kerr returned to his post in Moscow from London on Sunday, after ending his leave earlier than expected.</p>
<h3>Spain Trains Naval Personnel</h3>
<p>Madrid, 2nd (Central News Agency) – This naval school began a new training course yesterday, with several ministers from the army, navy, and air force, and senior officials from the general staff participating. At the beginning of the ceremony, Naval Chief Admiral Moreno explained the school's important mission of training naval personnel.</p>
<h3>Germany Has Great Confidence in Spain, Which Will Certainly Maintain National Dignity</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – British and American official propaganda agencies are frequently spreading rumors that Spain has severed relations with the Axis powers. However, the German Foreign Ministry announced at noon on the 1st that British and American propaganda agencies have been spreading such rumors for a long time, but the Spanish government has always insisted on neutrality. It cannot be said that Head of State Franco has abandoned this principle, so attempts to influence or threaten Spanish policy will ultimately fail.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Political circles in Berlin commented on the basic attitude of Spain towards the increasing political pressure from anti-Axis countries, saying that in Spanish history, the honor and dignity of the nation, and the desire for independence, have played an extremely important role. This principle is also effective in the Spain of General Franco's time. Therefore, Berlin believes that all attempts or threats to undermine Spain's internal affairs will ultimately fail. For centuries, national honor and dignity have been the foundation of Spain, and General Franco will naturally adopt the same attitude. Furthermore, he will lead Spain from revolution to reconstruction. The German side believes that the rumors spread by the anti-Axis powers that Spain will sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers are extremely absurd. Since Portugal became a target of British and American instigation, Berlin political circles have believed that Prime Minister Salazar would prioritize Portugal's interests. Although Portugal finally made concessions to Britain and America regarding the Azores Islands incident, it did not affect this general deduction. Political circles in Berlin believe that the anti-Axis powers' efforts to force neutral countries to change their attitude, similar attempts on Sweden, can be seen as an action with the aim of "expanding the scope of the war."</p>
<h3>Eden Declaration Temporarily Called Off</h3>
<p>London, 2nd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports, according to diplomatic correspondents: British Foreign Secretary Eden will apparently not issue a declaration on British-Spanish relations, which everyone has been eagerly awaiting. It is said that he has received hints that Eden, after reading the report from the British Ambassador to Spain Sir Samuel Hoare, indicated that it would be inappropriate for the British government to issue a strong declaration at this time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Since the American government banned the import of petroleum into Spain, it has become clear that the diplomatic and economic pressure exerted by Britain and the United States on Spain is intensifying. The intention is nothing more than to force Spain to join the anti-Axis camp. However, according to observations by a powerful British figure, it is not easy for Spain to abandon its neutrality. According to the Associated Press in London:</p>
<h3>Spain Restricts Gasoline Consumption</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – After the U.S. State Department and the British government both decided to ban the export of kerosene to Spain from February, the Spanish government issued a notice on the 1st, requiring citizens to conserve kerosene use. At the same time, the chairman of the Fuel Committee also announced that the authorities are saving domestic kerosene consumption, not only limiting the use of automobiles, but also restricting public transportation within the realm of possibility. Gasoline for official vehicles will also be strictly limited in the future, but it will not affect the transportation of production goods.</p>
<h3>When Will the War End? Churchill Refuses to Express His Opinion</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to information received here: British Prime Minister Churchill attended a meeting of the House of Commons today. When asked when he thought the war would end, he refused to express his opinion. It is said that Labour Member of Parliament Maxton asked him to make a prediction. He replied that [missing text] on the mainland and in the East would be completed [missing text].</p>
<h3>1944 Soviet Budget (Continued)</h3>
<p>The 1943 military budget was tentatively set at 12.7 billion [currency], healthcare expenditures at 1.4 billion, tentatively 8.4 billion in 1943; welfare facilities expenditures at 1.54 billion, tentatively 1.24 billion in 1943; social insurance expenditures at 370 million, tentatively 300 million in 1943; state subsidies for mothers with many children at 80 million, tentatively 70 million in 1943. Furthermore, the total expenditure for state administrative organs in 1944 was 6.7 billion rubles, of which 2.3 billion was for the federal budget and 4.4 billion for the republic budget. The planned revenue from transaction taxes in the 1944 budget was 8.2 billion rubles, an increase of 9.1 billion over 1943. Income tax revenue was set at 23.1 billion, an increase of 3.1 billion rubles compared to 1943. The revenue tax from state-owned enterprises was 27.3 billion, an increase of 17% compared to the 21.7 billion in 1943. National tax revenue was 34.3 billion, and state revenue was planned at 30.3 billion rubles. The total local budget of the republics for 1944 was 36 billion rubles, an increase of 1.6 billion compared to 1943. Due to the severe economic damage suffered by the Ukrainian Republic, its revenue accounted for only 14.4% of its total expenditures, while the Russian Republic's revenue accounted for only 63%. Therefore, the Federal government decided to subsidize the Ukrainian Republic with 1.019 billion rubles and the Belarusian Republic with 25 million rubles.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle for Rome Railway Line Lasts Two Days and Nights; German Forces Still Hold Their Ground</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: Fierce battles continued on Tuesday along the coast of Pontine and on the southern Italian front. The Anglo-American forces have numerical superiority and are using all available resources to fight, indicating that they are willing to pay any price to achieve a victory. The enemy is fighting desperately in the landing zone and on the Garigliano River and Mount Pigna to break through, but all attempts are blocked by the unshakeable German defenses. On Tuesday, Anglo-American forces launched several fierce attacks in the northwest direction, but were all repelled. After reorganizing their main forces, the enemy attacked east of Apulia and southwest of Cisterna. Every inch of ground is contested with fierce fighting. The British forces in Apulia launched four attacks, all of which were crushed in front of the German lines. Heavy fighting continues uninterrupted north of Cassino and near Sant'Elia. One enemy position on the upper reaches of the Rapido River was captured by German forces. Meanwhile, in the Castelnuovo area, a group of German forces penetrated the enemy lines and inflicted substantial damage. Lieutenant General Leese's British Eighth Army attempted to break through the German forward positions along the coast of Atria. The enemy forces were supported by powerful artillery and tanks, but were repelled in fierce hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The situation on the Italian front is becoming increasingly tense. The anti-Axis forces that landed in Anzio are engaged in fierce battles to advance towards Rome. According to a Reuters correspondent, the most brutal fighting since the landing has continued for two days and nights, and the intensity of the fighting can be imagined. Currently, on the anti-Axis side, American forces on the right wing are pushing directly towards Cisterna on the Apulia-to-Rome railway line. British forces are advancing towards Campoleone, located twelve miles northwest of Cisterna, at the intersection of the Albano highway and railway. German forces have built strong positions along the railway line between the two locations. It is expected that this frontal battle will intensify. Reports indicate that American forces have advanced to within half a mile of Cisterna, where German forces are reportedly firmly defending their positions, according to the Associated Press and Reuters. The American Fifth Army on the Cassino front is determined to capture this front at any cost. According to the Associated Press, American forces that crossed the Rapido River are gradually attacking numerous German positions on the hills surrounding Cassino and have occupied two hills. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting near the village of Cairo, three miles north of Cassino. The situation on the eastern Adriatic coast is also becoming more active, with Canadian forces of the British Eighth Army attempting to attack Pescara. Reports indicate that German forces are also putting up fierce resistance in that area.</p>
<h3>Air Raid Damages Ancient City in Northern Italy</h3>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: A broadcast here today stated that during a recent anti-Axis bombing raid on the city of Bologna in northern Italy, residential areas suffered damage and there were casualties among the civilian population. Many historically famous buildings were also destroyed. The Basilica of San Domenico and the Basilica of San Giacomo Maggiore suffered significant damage. The Basilica of San Petronio and the historically renowned University of Bologna also sustained severe damage.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Insists on Maintaining the Curzon Line; Polish-Soviet Disputes Not Easily Resolved</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The knot in the relationship between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union has not been resolved since the disputes arose last March. The Soviet-Polish border issue has become apparent and has become a significant issue within the anti-Axis camp. The Soviet Union's insistence on the "Curzon Line" is a key aspect to watch. The "Curzon Line" refers to the proposal made by British Foreign Secretary Curzon during the Allied Supreme Council of the four powers (Britain, the United States, France, and Italy) at the end of World War I in 1919 regarding the Soviet-Polish border. In 1919, Poland acted as a vanguard against communism and received support from the Allied nations, enjoying considerable activity. However, the United States did not want Poland to become too powerful and proposed the Curzon Line as the most appropriate natural border between the two nations to encourage a Soviet-Polish truce. In 1920, Polish troops invaded Soviet territory on a large scale and occupied Kiev. At that time, the Soviet Union launched a counteroffensive to protect its territory, and General Tukhachevsky's Cossack cavalry broke through the Curzon Line in one fell swoop and advanced to the outskirts of Warsaw, the Polish capital. However, the Polish army defended fiercely and received French aid, forcing the Soviet army to retreat to its own country. In 1921, a peace conference was held in Riga, and a peace treaty was signed, drawing the Soviet-Polish border far to the east of the Curzon Line. This is the original Soviet-Polish border line before the current meeting.</p>

<h3>The New Outline of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Two years have passed since the Greater East Asia War, and four years have passed since the European War. Amidst unprecedentedly brutal struggles, we welcome a new spring, and the final decisive stage of the world war is rapidly brewing here. The Allied powers, Britain and the United States, have built a strong position in a corner of our outer Pacific ring in the east and are engaged in bloody combat with Germany near the so-called iron wall of Europe in the west. Roosevelt intends to use the largest possible force to burn his boats and take a desperate gamble to achieve a final victory in 1944. In this way, it is of course conceivable how intense and cruel the Allied offensive against the Axis powers will be this year! This is also the reason why the people of the Axis countries must fight desperately for "survival" and "victory." In this historically significant year, what kind of strategy and posture will the Allied powers adopt as they straddle the two major decisive battlefields of Europe and Asia to launch a challenge? Our company (Yomiuri-Hochi Shimbun) instructed its special correspondent in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mr. Furuta, and its special correspondent in Stockholm, Sweden, Mr. Kitamura, to convene commentators and journalists from both neutral countries to hold a symposium on the decisive outlines of the Greater East Asia War and the European War. Both battlefields urgently demand the greatest sacrifice from the people and fully demonstrate the unprecedented difficult situation of the Axis countries. For the time being, we will first report on the situation of the symposium on the "Outline of the Decisive Battle in the Pacific" convened in Buenos Aires, so that the one hundred million fighting Japanese people can cope with this "year of decisive battle." —Sent by Special Correspondent Furuta on January 1st—</p>

<h3>A Roundtable Discussion with Neutral Country Commentators on the Sino-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent, Gutian</p>
<p>On December 25th, Roosevelt publicly declared via radio broadcast that he would "end the Pacific War as early as possible." Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō Hideki had pointed out even earlier than Roosevelt that 1944 would be the final and decisive year. Judging from the actual circumstances on all sides, the Pacific War will indeed reach a clear resolution this year, a point universally acknowledged worldwide. On this first day of such a crucial year, please, without adhering to any particular stance, offer your candid and open views!</p>
<p>"Limited War" vs. "Unlimited War"</p>
<p>Mr. A: Regarding the temporal character of the Pacific War, I would like to use the terms "Limited War" and "Unlimited War" as described by Mahan, Clausewitz, and Jomini, among others. At the outset of the war, Japan rapidly expanded its occupied territories in the western Pacific and along the coast of the Far East. However, Japan has no defensible territories in the eastern Pacific, so there is no need to occupy other people's land. It only needs to establish a strategic posture like an impregnable copper wall around its acquired occupied territories. In other words, first strive for a favorable posture for so-called interior lines operations, and then strike attacking enemies, which can be called "bleeding operations." This character is extremely limited. However, the United States cannot do this. Since the United States owns territories in the western Pacific and hopes to develop significantly in the Far East, and since the United States fears the increasingly powerful Greater East Asia War posture of Japan, it must dispatch troops from afar, regardless of everything, and repeatedly attack Japan's defensive zone. In other words, the United States has no choice but to conduct an "unlimited war" against Japan's "limited" one. This is the rationale. At the same time, if it does not advance continuously with a huge expenditure of manpower and material resources, it will not work for the United States. However, when the United States superficially displays unlimited combat power, gradually pushes into Japan's defensive zone, and reaches a strategic posture that highly threatens Japan, then Japan must abandon its limited character and launch a full-scale offensive again. The form I am describing reflects the progress of the Pacific War, and the final decisive stage mentioned above will appear this year. I believe that "1944 is the decisive year for the Pacific" means just that.</p>
<p>The American Dream of an Offensive Plan</p>
<p>Mr. B: The American offensive against Japan will indeed reach its peak this year. From an overall strategic perspective, the U.S. military strategy does want to control the Japanese mainland and recover the Philippines. So how exactly will they proceed? I believe that the United States aims to control and acquire Micronesia Islands, including the Marshall Islands and the Caroline Islands, and the Mariana Islands to their northwest. Among the Micronesia Islands, the most noteworthy are Jaluit Island, Ponape Island, and Truk Island. However, Truk Island is only about 1,500 kilometers from Rabaul. If the United States captures New Britain Island, then Truk Island will fall within the bombing range of American aircraft and become a target of General Halsey's offensive. In addition, Jaluit Island in the group is 1,800 nautical miles from the U.S. naval base on Midway Island, which is within the 2,000-nautical-mile operational radius of modern fleets, and within the 1,300-kilometer bombing range of the U.S. airbase on the Gilbert Islands. When General Halsey launches a major offensive toward Truk Island, Admiral Nimitz is very likely to launch a coordinated operation to attack Jaluit. Furthermore, the second goal of the United States will be to advance toward the Mariana Islands. Guam Island is 1,200 nautical miles from Jaluit, and from Guam as the center, it is 1,560 nautical miles to Yokohama on the Japanese mainland and 1,730 nautical miles to Manila. Guam is the main base for simultaneously striking the Japanese mainland directly and recovering the Philippines, as Baldwin said. Naturally, Japan must launch unprecedented and astonishing continuous battles to counter this grand-scale offensive. If Japan fails in this thrilling final decisive battle, then the aforementioned American strategy will be immediately realized.</p>
<p>From Leapfrogging Island-Hopping Tactics to Large Mobile Warfare</p>
<p>Mr. C: If the United States recovers Guam, it will carry out the largest-scale terror air raids on the Japanese mainland, which will definitely be conducted directly from Guam. At the same time, it will also put pressure on the Philippines, cross the South China Sea, and make contact with China. In this situation, not only will Japan's connection with the Southern Resource Area be severed, but also the absolutely secure East Indies will be in danger of breaking away from Japan. When the United States carries out this strategy, two points cannot be neglected:</p>
<p>First, when the United States conducts breakthrough operations in both oceans, it will change the previous leapfrogging island-hopping tactics from the Solomon Islands northward. Because of the distance of the air bases, the power of the aircraft cannot be fully utilized, so the nature of the offensive operations must be changed. That is to say, it must rely exclusively on large mobile forces centered on aircraft carriers. During such a vast and expansive expedition, whether from Hawaii, Samoa Islands, Midway Island, or even from New Britain Island (assuming it is occupied by the United States), the distances are all thousands of nautical miles. Whether such a large mobile force can be continuously replenished from the United States and from all directions is a major question.</p>
<p>Since suffering a huge loss at Pearl Harbor, the United States has continuously dispatched relatively large-scale mobile forces only twice during the two years of the Pacific War. That is to say, the first time was from the first Battle of the Solomon Sea in August 1942 to the Battle of the South Pacific on October 26. The second time was a year later, in November 1943, during the era of naval and air battles near Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. In other words, it took eight months to recover from the losses and wounds of Pearl Harbor, and it took a year to recover from the wounds of the Battle of the Solomon Sea, until great mobile forces appeared in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands in November.</p>
<p>The second point that should be noted is that the losses that such a large mobile force may suffer will far exceed the ratio of the great battles of the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands. Because Japan's supply lines are shortened and the U.S. supply lines are lengthened, U.S. losses will definitely gradually increase.</p>
<p>The Periodicity of the "Limits" of American Productivity</p>
<p>Mr. D: Ultimately, the problem lies in the productive capacity of the United States. In other words, the question is whether American productivity has already reached its peak this year, and whether objective conditions will permanently allow it to continue so smoothly. What exactly is the actual situation of the "limits" of American productivity that people often like to talk about?</p>
<p>The planned production amount for the 1943 fiscal year was 75 billion dollars, but it was reduced to 65 billion dollars. Finally, ordinary people were clamoring that this was the "limit." However, it should not be forgotten that this "limit" is by no means fixed. It must be noted that one limit often produces the development of another type of limit. In this sense, reviewing the past two years of history can reveal this. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, production soared in a rapid and vigorous manner until August 1942. If the production volume in the second half of 1940 is taken as 100, then August reached a ratio of 361. As a result, manpower and material resources reached their highest limits. Later, until December, the number of 361 in August did not change, and during this period, they devoted themselves to breaking through this limit, painstakingly adjusting manpower and material resources. This can be seen in the changes to the military supply ratio system in November and December 1942 and the modification of labor force allocation. As a result, the first "limit" was broken through. Just looking at the production volume of aircraft can reveal this: 5,000 aircraft in January, 6,000 in April, and as many as 7,200 in May. Then another "limit" came. For example, 7,000 in June, 7,373 in July, 7,612 in August, and 7,598 in September, actually regressing slightly. At that time, they once again wracked their brains to implement adjustments to the domestic war front. As a result, this effort broke through the second "limit." The aircraft production volume in October set a new record of 8,362 aircraft, and November saw another leap forward development of 8,789 aircraft, an increase of 1,181 aircraft compared to September. Looking at it this way, the "limit" that appeared in September and October will definitely be broken through again soon, but breaking through this new "limit" will gradually encounter many difficulties and hardships. In short, although the limit of productivity is cyclical, the question of whether the United States can still break through the increasingly complex "limits" will be a major problem in the future.</p>
<p>Mr. B: What I find most interesting in what you just said is the correlation between the peak of productivity and the American offensive. When productivity reached its initial "high tide" in August 1941, it prompted the United States to land on Guadalcanal Island and launch a counteroffensive in the Solomon Islands. The productivity "peak" in June 1943 prompted the United States to launch a general counteroffensive on New Georgia, New Guinea, and Rentba Island. The third peak in October and November of the same year prompted the United States to launch a counteroffensive in Bougainville, the Gilbert Islands, and then New Britain. Roosevelt's method of operation is to try to determine the outcome this year at the very least. Therefore, in order to overcome the "limits" of this year, Roosevelt, who wants to expand all raw materials and labor to the highest degree, said on December 25 that he would use the "burn-the-boats" method to defeat Japan. This statement is worth discussing seriously.</p>
<p>American's Omnidirectional and Unpredictable Tactics -- Special Correspondent, Gutian</p>
<p>It is said that Roosevelt "will launch an offensive from the east, west, north, and south of the Pacific."</p>
<p>Mr. E: This refers to landing on the Kuril Islands from the Aleutians, launching a large-scale offensive of thousands of miles from the Chinese mainland, Mountbatten's offensive towards Burma in the Indian Ocean, and aircraft bombing of the Japanese mainland from the American homeland.</p>
<p>Mr. Novalis (a famous Argentine naval critic) said that recently, Vice Admiral Fletcher accompanied the naval commander of the North Pacific region, which clearly added roads and actively concentrated large numbers of special units, warships, and military supplies.</p>
<p>The famous and resourceful strategist of the U.S. Army Air Forces, Jonson, has already taken office as the commander of the Alaska Air Force, which is something to take seriously. Seversky's loud clamoring for air raids on Japan from the American homeland is by no means an empty promise of a blank check, and it is indeed worth seriously discussing. At the same time, we must never ignore the emergence of stratospheric flight warfare, and we must be prepared for the successful testing of American B-29 type super long-range bombers. In short, what must be paid special attention to is that the American strategy is by no means uniform or conventional.</p>
<p>Mr. C: There is also Mountbatten, who is watching intently and eager to fight on Ceylon Island.</p>
<p>Possibility of Direct Attack on the Southern Resource Area</p>
<p>Mr. A: Even so, American combat power also has its own limits and its "center of gravity." Where exactly will the center of gravity of the offensive be? Personally, I believe it will be in the Southern Resource Area. That is what I said earlier, instead of taking a central offensive strategy with a lot of time and sacrifice to recover the Philippines and cut off Japan's transportation lines with the Southern Resource Area, it would be better to directly occupy the Southern Resource Area itself, because it can not only greatly reduce consumption, but also shorten the time. So which route will be taken to attack the Southern Resource Area? I think it must be the Arafura Sea and the Timor Sea between northern Australia and western New Guinea. In this sea area, the United States can maximize the use of the ports of Port Moresby and Merauke in New Guinea, as well as the Darwin Port, which recently laid railway transportation with Sydney, as bases. Just like the leapfrogging island-hopping tactics used in the Solomon Islands, they will advance northward, from Mycale to Aru Islands to Kel Islands, to Tanimbar, and to Timor Laut Island. The advantage is that it can combine the power of aircraft from air bases with mobile forces, and it can avoid the problem of prolonging the supply lines compared to other offensive routes. This offensive route has such great advantages and is worth special attention.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can absolutely imagine that Mountbatten will cooperate with this operation. He already has a strong force and will receive a large increase in ships, and then attack Sumatra and Malaya from the Nicobar Islands and the Andaman Islands.</p>
<p>Mr. C: The problem still lies in whether Japan's production can constantly keep up with the rapid development of American productivity at a certain ratio. If it can keep up with American productivity, then there is hope of not being defeated. Otherwise, it is unthinkable. People are generally talking about the issue of quality and quantity, but only quality or only quantity cannot win. Both are necessary. According to previous examples, the Tōgō fleet of the Japanese Sea was far superior to the Russian fleet of the Baltic Sea in terms of quality, but there was no distinction in terms of quantity, so Japan won. In 1940, Germany's blitzkrieg in Western Europe was extremely excellent in terms of quality, and it also had an absolute advantage in terms of quantity, which is why Germany won quickly. If Japan wants to make 1944 a "year of victory," it must desperately increase domestic productivity, maintain the strength of the Japanese military, and inflict a head-on blow to the American army that is attacking in a do-or-die manner.

<h3>The Trolley Fares of the First District Will Implement New Prices Starting on the 15th: First Class Fixed at One Yuan, Third Class at Five Jiao</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: Mr. Yamaguchi, the manager of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, told a reporter from the Times yesterday that the trolley fares in the First District of this city will implement new measures starting on the 15th of this month. The new measures divide the district into four sections. Within each section, regardless of the distance, the fare will be one yuan per ride. However, the monthly pass prices before March will not be changed. At that time, the first-class monthly pass will be increased from 90 yuan to 160 yuan, and other monthly passes will also be increased proportionally. It is also learned that the French Tramway Company will also slightly increase its minimum fares starting on the 1st. The minimum fare for first-class cars has been increased from 8 jiao to 1 yuan, and the minimum fare for third-class cars has been increased by 2 jiao to 7 jiao. According to the person in charge of the company, the price increase is for the benefit of the public and is an experimental measure. The company hopes to reduce short-distance passengers and avoid excessive congestion during peak hours. In addition, the French Tramway Company has no other plans to increase prices.</p>
<p>Dividing into Four Sections</p>
<p>As for the new fare increase of the Shanghai Electric Tramway Company, according to Mr. Yamaguchi, the first class fare is fixed at one yuan and the third class fare is fixed at five jiao. The four newly divided sections are: From Jing'an Temple to the Bund. From the Bund to Hongkou Park. From the Bund to Tilanqiao. From Tilanqiao to Yangshupu.

<h3>The Shanghai Telephone Company Hosts the Press Community, Hoping to Minimize Use and Ease Difficulties</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Telephone Company, in view of the recent busy telephone traffic, published advertisements in newspapers, hoping that users would voluntarily limit their use of telephones when not necessary. In order to seek opinions from all parties, a grand banquet was held at the Golden Gate Hotel on the ninth floor yesterday at 5:00 PM to host the local press community.</p>
<p>Those attending included Mr. Hidaka Kiyomasa, Editor-in-Chief of the Continental News Editorial Bureau, Xu Liqu, Acting President of the China Daily, Yang Huilang, Acting Director of the Shanghai Branch of the Central News Agency, Chen Binhe (represented by Liu Hanru), President of the Shen Bao, Lu Guangjie, Editor-in-Chief of the Ping Bao, Lu Feng, Chief Writer of the New China News, Wang Ping, Editor-in-Chief, Cheng Zhongquan, Manager of the News Journal, and Ren Yunpeng, Secretary-General of the News Federation, etc. On the company side, those attending included Manager Shinohara Kiyotada, Secretary-General Sato Yoshiro, Business Section Chief Kikui Tomiji, Engineering Section Chief Kojima Isamu, Communication Technology Section Chief Takagi Koshiro, and Nonaka Ichiro, etc., totaling over twenty people.</p>
<p>Manager's Speech</p>
<p>The event began with a speech by Manager Shinohara Kiyotada of the company, who said: "I am very honored that everyone was able to take time out of their busy schedules to attend. Recently, the company has made its best efforts to solve the difficulty that users have in making telephone calls and getting through. However, although the telephone is one of the means of transportation, it cannot refuse passengers when it is crowded like a trolley. Furthermore, the operators and switchboards of the telephone company cannot judge whether the content of the users' telephone calls is important or not, and then decide the priority of connecting the lines. Therefore, the company can only hope that all five million citizens of Shanghai can cooperate with the company to practice thrift. When it is not necessary, do not use the telephone casually. Even when it is necessary to make a telephone call, please shorten the telephone time so that other users can use it. Recently, there are about one million telephone calls made in the city every day. The company feels very sorry that many users cannot get through on the phone. I hope that the press community will express their opinions and give guidance tonight," he said. Immediately afterwards, a grand banquet was held. During the banquet, toasts were exchanged, and the press community successively expressed their opinions. The company side answered them satisfactorily one by one. The party ended in a happy atmosphere at 8:30 PM.</p>

<p>Scholarship Funds Received Yesterday</p>
<p>The scholarship funds received yesterday are listed below: World Red Swastika Society's Xiu Ming Elementary School 10,000 yuan, Yi You De Hao 10,000 yuan, Pan Jiyan 10,000 yuan, He Zhuoxian 10,000 yuan, Yi Ji (raised by Mr. Hong Pengnian) 10,000 yuan, Yan Dexiu, Yu Ji (raised by Mr. Hong Pengnian) 5,000 yuan each, elementary school students Zhu Chenglie, Chengyong, Yaliang, Jin Su, (lucky money) 5,000 yuan in total, Li Shenghong, Sun Runsheng 2,000 yuan each, Qi Deji 1,400 yuan, Cui Pingxi, Chuan Bingzhang, Chou Ji 1,000 yuan each, Li Jianming, Liu Zhaotang, Zhou X, Dou Junpei, Wen Ji, Ming Ji 500 yuan each, Nan Tianfang, Jin Gu Gong Ji 400 yuan each, De Ji 360 yuan, Shi Jun 300 yuan, Qi Dehou, Qi Zongjun, Qi Xiuying, Luo Zhaojian, Wu Deyang, Dai Cunzhong, Cui Yanming, Zhang Wenbo, Lin Wang Shanqing, Lin Cai Xian, Lin Zhaolin, Lin Xianglin, Lin Xuezhen 200 yuan each, Chen Guozhong 150 yuan, Zhou Yuebin 100 yuan.

The previous balance was 1,071,242 yuan, and the current balance is 2,400,3509 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changes in the Selling Price of Goods Must Be Reported for Approval</h3>
<p>In order to curb the rising prices, the competent authorities have previously issued orders stipulating that if any business intends to change the selling price of any item due to cost factors, the business must jointly report to the industry association and state the reasons and business conditions. After the industry association has reviewed the matter, it shall be submitted to the competent authorities for approval. After approval, the industry association shall print the price list of the goods and distribute it to all member businesses for compliance. It has recently been learned that companies and businesses in various industries have not followed the above procedures for the selling prices of goods, and have illegally raised prices, causing the prices of various goods to continue to rise to new peaks. The selling prices of the same type of goods also vary greatly. It is reported that major businesses are refusing to sell large quantities of goods in stock, resulting in a situation where some major goods are available on the market but not in stock. Among them, silk fabrics (men's) are the most serious, followed by western medicines, hardware parts, and paper. Silk and satin stores only display a small number of women's clothing materials, and they are only open in the morning and close in the afternoon. Some even post a red strip of paper on the door with the words "Internal reorganization, temporary closure." If these businesses continue to delay in a semi-operational state, it is not without violating the authorities' goal of reviving Shanghai's industry and commerce and the suspicion of refusing to sell materials. It is not only related to social livelihood but also stimulates people's hearts. It is hoped that the authorities will instruct the industry associations to inform their member businesses to resume normal operations immediately and to fully allocate the goods sold by these companies and businesses on a regular basis. Otherwise, the future of industry and commerce is a cause for concern.</p>

<h3>The Current Crisis of Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Factories</h3>
<p>— Xiao</p>
<p>Our country's industry has always been backward. In recent decades, through the efforts of people from all walks of life to plan and manage, only light industry has taken a rudimentary shape. Among them, the dyeing and weaving factory industry has progressed particularly rapidly. During the August 13th Incident, most of the factory sites were located in Zhabei in western Shanghai, which was deeply affected. As the war moved west, the factories spared no effort to reorganize. At that time, the national sentiment was not strong, and those with capital were happy to invest. The industrial and financial circles also added maintenance. The old ones had nowhere to die, and the emerging ones sprung up like mushrooms after the rain. This is because imported goods have gradually disappeared in recent years, and domestic cotton cloth has become more popular, giving dyeing and weaving factories a great opportunity for development. As of last year, there were more than 1,300 dyeing and weaving factories in Shanghai alone. The production volume increased day by day, and the number of employees was more than 100,000. If production and sales can be smoothly coordinated, it will be beneficial to the war economy. After the promulgation of the Yarn and Cloth Acquisition Decree last August, these more than 1,300 dyeing and weaving factories were all affected by the punishment of Guo Kou Yu Er (caught in the crossfire) . At that time, in addition to temporarily stopping work, all the raw yarn and finished products in stock were applied to the Shang Tong Hui (Chamber of Commerce) for sale within the time limit. This spirit of abandoning selfishness and sacrificing the small self is truly great.</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth of the dyeing and weaving factory have already been applied for sale, and the proceeds have not been received for a while. As a result, the use of funds has been disrupted, and production has been completely stopped. The livelihood of employees cannot be maintained. At that time, the Central Reserve Bank once agreed to provide loans to teach and help, but due to various reasons, this loan became a pipe dream. For several months, they have been guarding the machines, raising their heads to look at the roof in vain. The announcement of closure is heard every day. A small number of those with relatively strong capital are still struggling to maintain themselves. The hope is that the allocation of raw materials will be realized as soon as possible. When planning to resume work to maintain the livelihood of employees, they are suddenly restricted by electricity. This is like adding frost to snow. The hope of recovery has become a dream again. If there is no appropriate relief measure, the future of the entire dyeing and weaving factory industry is really unimaginable!</p>
<p>The government controls the people's materials during the war. All countries in the East and West are the same, but control contains compulsion. Treating the symptoms but not curing the root cause must be supplemented by increasing production. Therefore, Chairman Wang's instruction at the third meeting of the National Economic Commission spoke in detail on the issue of increasing production. Increasing production is indeed an urgent task, not only for dyeing and weaving factories. However, the collapse of dyeing and weaving factories is imminent. Not only will 100,000 employees lose their support, but the national economic foundation may also be shaken. It is hoped that the price-giving method for purchasing yarn and cloth can be adjusted in the future. The allocation of raw materials will be realized quickly, and the restriction on factory electricity will be relaxed. That is, start from protecting production and cultivating production to achieve the goal of increasing production, so as not to live up to Chairman Wang's announcement of this year as the year of increasing production.</p>
<h3>Illegal Levies by Township Chiefs</h3>
<p>— Zhong Chengmu</p>
<p>Reading the article "Over-Collection of Field Tax" in this forum on the 22nd, I am reminded that my hometown also has the same situation, and it is even darker than the Yangjing area. The village chiefs of Changzhou's various villages and districts levy military rice donations of 100 yuan to 400 yuan per mu in the name of. (In some places, it is 40 to 80 kilograms of rice) The total amount of land in the county is calculated at 2 million mu, totaling more than 400 million yuan, and there are other temporary monthly donations not included. The income from agricultural production does not count what is spent, and the villagers are like hanging upside down. It has always been the practice of the allied countries to pay for military rice. Now, in addition to military rice, another military rice donation is established, and it is levied on a household-by-household basis, but it is not worth the money. (In some places, armed police are brought along to collect it forcibly from house to house) Farmers are forced by Fu Wei, although complaints are heard everywhere, they dare to be angry but dare not speak. Such violent extortion will get worse year by year. The collapse of rural areas and the shaking of national wood are the worst. Please government authorities and allied agencies pay attention to this matter, severely punish the poor, and solve the people's difficulties. On the one hand, our fellow villagers in our hometown cooperate with the government to gather the evidence of the bad deeds of the village chiefs in each district and report them. Perhaps it will not be difficult to clean up the general criminal officials, and the farmers will be very fortunate! The country is very fortunate!</p>

<p>Economic Commentary</p>
<h3>Because of Rumors of the Reopening of Gold Exchange</h3>
<p>Because of the rumors of the reopening of the Gold Exchange, the Shanghai financial market in the past two days has once again shown a sign of storms, and its impact can be seen in two types of Xiong Mao (panda?). One is the once skyrocketing price of boiled red, and the other is the sudden downward trend in the stock market; according to the usual market dynamics, the price of boiled red rises, and everything rises with it, and stock prices are no exception; this time the price of boiled red rises , In addition to the skyrocketing prices of everything, it did not stimulate stock prices to rise; on the contrary, in the rise of boiled red prices, some of the 25 newly listed stocks had no transactions at all. This situation is unprecedented, and The reason is that those who take gold as the object of hoarding speculation have reached a period of stagnation and thinking about moving. The market has formed a pattern of everyone scrambling to buy gold. Its impact is not limited to the stock market alone.</p>
<p>Since the financial authorities have formally stated that there is absolutely no such thing as reopening the Gold Exchange, and there is no such consideration, the market dynamics caused by the rumors of the reopening of the Gold Exchange can be gradually dissipated; however, the current trend of rushing to buy gold is a mistake. Because my country's currency has long been divorced from gold, there is no possibility of restoring gold and wood in the Greater East Asia financial circle after the war; in order to solve the destination of idle funds, it is better to hoard such a "hunger can not be eaten, cold can not be clothed" As for waste, why not invest in various production undertakings to prosper the mass life in the era of increased production? Isn't it mutually beneficial to both yourself and others?</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Implements Tight Credit, Silver Union Carefully Interbank Lending</h3>
<p>In order to help various industries increase production, after restoring loans, all banks and villages in the silver and money industries follow the newly promulgated loan methods and the financial department's loan restriction methods. It is heard that they are particularly cautious about guarantors, regardless of mortgage or credit, so after each remittance money village goes public, the overdraft accounts are temporarily limited to old customers with good credit. It is not easy for new customers to request loans. At the same time, the Bank Union Reserve and the Money Industry Reserve tighten the provision of low-interest collateral for interbank lending to member banks and villages. They also need to explain the proper use before giving consideration to the loan. Therefore, the entire money market tends to tighten in the midst of tightening credit. For example, the interbank interest rate in the money industry market has always been white lending at the beginning of each listing. The highest is no more than a few points. The first day of listing this year was 12 cents, and then it rose to 15 cents to 20 cents, which proves that the interbank lending between banks and villages is very tight. As for the loan interest rates of various banks and villages, they are still above 3 cents per month. This situation is a good phenomenon to prevent speculation, hoarding, and prevent price increases.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Fall, Easy to Rise: Chinese Stocks Temporarily in Sideways Trading, Newly Listed Stocks Actively Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks entered a sideways trading pattern, initially declining before recovering. By noon, they had regained strength, and in the afternoon, off-exchange prices rose further. Ultimately, stocks in various sectors mostly saw gains with fewer declines. Although confidence had returned since the halt of the epidemic on the previous day, most investors were still constrained by tight credit and unable to act freely. Wing On Company in the department store sector initially saw flat trading but rose to $224.5 in the afternoon. National Products rose $11, but then retreated slightly to $157 in the afternoon. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile Mill rose to $211-212 in the afternoon, while Tung Yih rose another $12. U.S.-Asia Underwear, etc., remained strong. Silk stocks saw declines. King Fook Shirts &amp; Socks rose to $38 in the afternoon, reversing its earlier decline. The new pharmaceutical sector remained stagnant with little change. In the chemical sector, Calcium Milk Life and China Milk Powder both rose. In the cultural sector, China Books remained unchanged, while World Book Company surged by $10, rising further to $144 in the afternoon. Public utilities stocks were the most stable. In real estate, Taishan rose by $1.25, reaching $15 in the afternoon with active trading. In the industrial sector, only Li Ya Great China Industries saw a slight increase, while Jiu An and others saw declines. Standard Pearl Powder rose by half a dollar.

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— By Iwata Sanwo, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>Military Class (9)</p>
<p>Autumn has deepened, and the old efforts of the military class are progressing at an accelerated pace. However, in the days after November 8, their spirits were greatly agitated, and they often had to leave their desks.</p>
<p>At noon on the 8th, the armored warship with the Tenno's flag hoisted high on its mast appeared in the southern waterway of Sakurajima in its majestic form. On both sides of the street, from ministers and governors down, welcoming troops, local militias, students from various schools, and others crowded together. The students of the Second Middle School were near Stone Lantern Street, welcoming the emperor.</p>
<p>His Majesty the Emperor personally led the special large-scale road army exercises held in Miyazaki Prefecture for four days starting November 9. After the exercises, he toured various places in Miyazaki Prefecture, and on the 15th, he visited various places in Kagoshima Prefecture, returning to the First Girls' High School, which served as the imperial residence.</p>
<p>In Kagoshima City, welcoming the emperor was a rare and glorious event, so the emotions of the local people were bubbling like boiling fire. That night, a lantern parade of more than 12,000 male students from various schools in the city was held. Zhenren and Longtian also participated in the team under the command of Mr. Oshima.</p>
<p>Moreover, on the 17th, representative students from five prefectures outside the prefecture, along with local soldiers and firefighters, were granted a review at the Ishiki training ground. The senior students of the Second Middle School also had the honor of receiving this honor.</p>
<p>The rain that started the day before yesterday had cleared. It was a clear autumn sky. In Isu Village, north of the city, in farmhouses, there were red persimmon trees, yellow chrysanthemums, and the flags of the Japanese Imperial Army with a red heart on a white background were hanging at the entrances. The author now introduces Zhenren himself to express the impression of this beautiful day. In the commemorative issue of the Second Middle School Alumni Association magazine, there is an essay by him.</p>
<p>Receiving an Imperial Review Fourth Grade Taniguchi Zhenren</p>
<p>"Attention!" the trumpet sounded loudly, and tens of thousands of subjects, their hearts filled with sincerity, straightened their postures and looked directly at the national flag behind the throne, which was illuminated by the afternoon sunlight and slowly rising. (Omission) Soon, the chariot arrived at the meeting place to the tune of the national anthem, as if gliding. (Omission) Looking up at the emperor from within a short distance, I respectfully and fearfully performed the most respectful salute. Soon, the military band played a march, and the march-past began. The time had come for our youth's spirit to be displayed before the emperor. We marched forward as if we were about to crush the earth. When we reached the emperor, a command was given to lower our eyes. We had the honor of looking up at the emperor's face from a short distance and receiving a return salute. This honor made me so grateful that tears almost fell.</p>
<p>I firmly vowed in my heart, "In the future, I will definitely become a loyal soldier of His Majesty!" and passed before the throne. After the march-past ended, we returned to our original positions. And... (Omission)</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>When Zhenren and his friends were recalling the glory of that day while continuing their military class efforts, a new incident occurred at the school.</p>
<p>"It is said that Principal Kawada will be transferred to the First Middle School..." This rumor spread like wildfire throughout the school. The first and second graders did not feel much of an impact, but the third and fourth graders felt that this was a major event in the school and felt an unusual shock and indignation.</p>
<p>"Teacher, is this true?"</p>
<p>Zhenren asked Mr. Ogata this. The teacher had an embarrassed expression and only nodded silently.</p>
<p>From that day on, Zhenren lost his lovely smile. The truth of the incident was that the principal of the First Middle School was being transferred to another school, so his successor was to be filled by the principal of the Second Middle School, which was perfectly logical and a routine personnel change by the prefectural government. However, Zhenren did not understand that logic. Moreover, the "alma mater" that was the sole object in his heart appeared even more deeply before him.</p>
<p>"I absolutely do not agree with this kind of thing!"</p>
<p>Zhenren, who had always been very gentle, suddenly made such a rude statement, which surprised his classmates. However, the surprised classmates, along with all the students, alumni, parent-teacher association, and even the teachers, were all caught up in a whirlwind of grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Kagoshima has always been a place that is particularly grateful for teachers' kindness. The relationship between private schools and Saigo's uprising is the biggest example. Although there was no such large-scale movement this time, the passion of the emotions seemed to remain unchanged. Among the teachers and students, there were already those who declared that they would withdraw from the school. In fact, since Principal Kawada took office, the school's style and academic performance have been greatly enhanced, which is recognized by all.</p>

<h3>Lost Residence Permit Found in Outdoor Mailbox - How Can It Be Returned to the Owner?</h3>
<p>I work at the post office, responsible for opening roadside outdoor mailboxes. Each time when collecting letters, I inevitably find several citizen certificates, residence permits, or passes (probably thrown in by careless people). After opening them, I and my colleagues report them to our supervisors, who then try to notify those whose documents were stolen or lost to come to the post office to pick them up. This applies to certificates with local addresses. However, for documents without local addresses, it is impossible to notify the owner. Such documents that cannot be returned are very important. The owners of such documents are usually businessmen, travelers, or those seeking employment in Shanghai from other places. They are not familiar with anything in Shanghai, and their dialects are different. If they encounter inspection, they are likely to be suspected of something, which is very painful. I hope that people of insight in the community can think of a proper solution (preferably eliminating careless people, and secondly, finding a way to notify the losers where the documents are recovered) to alleviate the suffering of those who lost their documents.

<h3>Closing Date for Ciyou Association Winter Clothing Distribution Approaching</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ciyou Association will close the distribution of winter clothing for poor children on the 15th of this month. Anyone in need of winter clothing should apply to the association (Room 208, China Building, Great Shanghai Road) as soon as possible to avoid missing out. The association also has two orphanages and refugee shelters, housing more than 400 orphans and children. Based on current prices, monthly expenses are at least $160,000. The association's funds are very tight, and as of the end of last December, it had an overdraft of more than $60,000. This year's expenses are estimated to be $2 million, which has yet to be secured. The association is actively preparing to solicit donations from all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>News from Free Schools</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Pharmaceutical College Evening School, founded by Mr. Zhi Xueshi and Mr. Chi Zifu, two leading figures in the pharmaceutical industry, has been operating for four years. It does not charge tuition fees. Most of the teachers and students are employed in the pharmaceutical industry, making use of their spare time to enable students to "work and study" simultaneously. The main subjects are chemistry and pharmacy. The course lasts for three years, and classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Young people working in the pharmaceutical industry who aspire to further their studies can register at the fourth floor of the Siming Building on Nanjing Road with an introduction from their employer.
