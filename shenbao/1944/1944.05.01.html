<p>社評</p>
<h3>本報設立科學獎金</h3>
<p>本報為推進科學研究，獎勵科學人才起見，設置科學獎金，此事籌思已久，惟科學為專門學問，獎勵科學之事應由專家主持，　與中國科學社上海社友會商洽，　尤贊助，推定委員，組織委員會，主持其事。中國科學社為中國推進科學最早而又歷史最長之學術團體，上海社友會更為上海科學家之最大集團，木報得此助力，毅然成立，除首先捐助獎金十萬元以示提倡外，更願担任一切事務費用，惟盼各界人士，自由賜予捐助，則未來成效，必非淺鮮。委員會組織及獎金辦法，均在今日本報發表（見第二版），此後更擬陸續舉辦各種通俗或專門科學演講，畢行公開科學實騐，發行科學刊物，尤盼科學先進隨時惠予指導，共策進行。茲當成立之日，謹舉二義，以吿國人，一曰科學建設，二曰科學精神。</p>
<p>中國為世界上歷史最久之國家，而近百年來，國家之地位幾淪為半殖民地。中國又為世界上土地最廣之國家，而近百年來，中國國民之衣食，竟至不能自足自給。推原其）故，無非物質建設，在在不能及人。科學為一切物質建設之原動力，無科學，則物質亦無由建設，故我國近百年來物質建設之不能及人，其癥結所在，無科學基礎故耳。我國過去，未嘗不言科學建設，顧以認識不足，求效太切，每至畫虎不成，徒勞無功，譏者有謂，國家百廢俱舉，一事無成，其故無他，不從根本科學建設基礎着想而已，本報今茲獎勵科學，願竭棉薄，喚起國人，根本的從科學建設入手，不求速效，不圖近功，腳踏實地，瀾求上進，須知現代國家之建立，必需堅苦努力，非取巧苟且所能成功。此其</p>
<p>近世自然科學之成功，為世界史上唯一的劃時代之進步，隨科學之成功而來者，為世界人士思想之科學化，處事之能應用科學方法，所謂科學精神者是也。科學精神之特點有二：一曰求眞確，二曰有秩序。此在曾受科學訓練者觀之，原極尋常，顧在一般普通人士中求之，則有科學頭腦者，為數尚屬不多。我國今日，國論紛紜，國事龐雜，惟若依科學方法以分析而解剖之，則規定步驟，眞實做去，建國大道，即在目前。我人今日最要之工作，莫若啟迪國民科學之思想，必須從一般日常生活起始，普遍提倡科學，鍛煉科學頭腦。設使全國同胞，俱能受科學之訓練，立身行事，俱能以科學精神，則以四萬五千萬科學頭腦之力量，建立現代化之中華民國，實非難事。此其二。</p>
<p>科學之重要如此，科學研究之推進，自屬急不暇待，以本報之力薄，不敢以言提倡，所望各界人士，多賜贊助，使全國國民，重視科學，信仰科學，此則本報同人願竭愚誠，謹敢奉佈於全國國民者也。</p>
<h3>內憂外患夾攻中　英國不安的深刻化</h3>
<p>英國齣國內問題，因政府施策的不能盡如人意，而發生了許多難題，故前次邱吉爾的廣播中，其大部分普及國內問題。近來英國報章雜誌的論調。除了對政府的對蘇對美興棋不定齣外交政策表示不滿外，更加上了困難的國內問題。倫敦許多報寧都率社地載稱：「英國國內不無因戰爭而疲勞的繳兆」，尤以勞働階級中所可見的徽兆為最顯，例如最近時常發生的煤　罷工。英國勞動界均以為現政府終究不能滿足他們社會的要求。煤　夫的罷工，政府雖想盡種種對策，不終能使之停止。約克夏的九萬五千煤　夫，於四日實行罷工，罷工的主要原因，據倫敦來的消息，乃是因為食糧配給的不充分而飢餓。英國的實球週刊敘述英國人士目前的情緒說：</p>
<p>「現戰爭之一切悲慘相，已現於各人的臉上，道機的標準劇烈地動搖了，秩序，風紀隨燬了。許多事例都表示喪失了眞正的勇氣，厭戰的傾向，正在漸漸地增大起來。本年內如不能戰勝，英國人民雖將繼續戰爭，但殘　下來的文化，已不是偉大的文化了。縱使謗利，那也是無情的勝利。」</p>
<p>美國的非難</p>
<p>可見英國人民已喪失了對戰局動向的關心。加以美國的帝國主義政策，更給與刺激，英國人民對英國未來的不安，日見增加。駐美的英國記者們，時常非難美國的外交政策，這美國的外交政策，據英國人看來，美國大資本家的帝國主養色彩，正在逐漸濃厚起來，英國的一般民衆，均為之搖頭太息。英國的戰爭目的，究竟是為了什麼呢？而且美國對加拿大和澳洲的巨大影饗力，亦正在一天天增大。所以英國人民不等，美海軍艦船局長科克萊思的聲明：「美國在戰後有史上空前的大海軍，以此保護世界的和平」，就早巳注視着美國軍艦不斷增加的數字，而擔心英國的海洋支配或許永遠喪失。美國的壓迫英國，恃武器租借法為護符，此為英國政府感覺頭痛的原因之一。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰時為海軍次長的羅斯福，深知英國的手段，今為大總統，更不會有無代　租借武務的意思。據　此次美　國務卿史蒂丁尼　斯訪英的目的，即為討論因武器租接法而供給物資的淸算問題。且以海空單基地　渡獎國的問題，亦恐遭遇僵局。</p>
<p>且美方對於　特巴頓作戰齣非難，英國亦視為有傷其自尊心。駐美的芙國記者們頗怒美國何以亳無一言涉及參加太平洋反攻作戰的英海軍。邱吉爾曾再三訪問美國，巡歷全世界，反之，羅斯福何以一次也不訪問英國。況且羅斯福到處擴充美國勢力，而不商之於邱吉爾。英國在歐洲的地位，對蘇聯的地位如何？英政府的政策，是否眞正代表英國在歐洲的利書，不無疑問。英國人民認為蘇聯對英國態度的不遜、乃英國在歐洲的大危機。於是艾登外相的辭職說，　傳全歐，而揣測皮佛勃洛克為其後任。最近蘇聯消息報論難義大利政局的動　，乃英美與蘇聯政策的不同。因此，英國人民對本國未來的不安與動搖，一天天增大起來。（翔：譯自四磊入日西部朝日新聞）</p>
<h3>淮省聯銀與儲券　全面交換期延展　限本年五月及九月底為止</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電淮海省境內通貨，於上年十二月一日起，開始以中央儲備銀行券與原有之中國聯合準備銀行券，一併使用以來，迄已五月，成續異當良好。不獨該省內之金融賴以穩定，物便得以平衡，即入民使用，亦莫不稱便。財政常局為謀進一步完成該省境內之幣制統一工作起見，乃先於本年三月一日起。停止聯銀券在該省內之新發行，更規定自四月十日至四月三十日止，該省內為中儲券與聯銀勞之全面交換期，開始實施全面交換，其交換比率，仍堅持以中儲券百元對聯銀券十八元之基準，實施全面交換以來情形頗為良好，截止昨三十日止，已告交換期滿。原定期滿之後，聯銀券應禁止使用，惟以該省　　境遼闊，輻員廣大，僻隅之區，人民恐尚狃於積習，不能如期實行交換。茲者財政當避，為顧全人民利益計，乃將上項全面交換限期，酌予延展，規定　在該省內主要城市，如徐州市·海州·宿縣·連雲港·等四處，延展至本年五月三十一日止。自六月月一日起，所有中國聯合準備銀行券，則一律禁止再在該市縣內使用。　其他淮海省內各地區，則延展至本年九月卅日止，自十月一日起，中國聯合準備銀行券亦禁止使用。且更規定於五月一日起，所有該省內中央及地方各機關，曁國營事業之收支，一律以中儲券為單位，不得再使用聯銀券。至其他金融機關之存　券，若逾期仍不遵照改正者，則此後一概作為改正論。財政當局此次毅然將該省區內中儲券與聯銀券之全面交換期，酌予延展，此舉純為　全人民之利益，蓋偏遠各地之人民，在事實上等有不能如期依限換竣之苦衷，若不予以通融，則於人民利益之損失影響殊大。乃本安定民生之夙旨，不計主管當局行政上之麻煩，斷然酌予延展，此實為政府當局體恤民艱，關心民瘓之明證也。故凡該省人民均應仰體政府當局之　心，其有尚未實施交換者，應從速導照辦理，勿再稍事猶豫觀望，以期不至期血可及早完成，如此則庶可免人民之利益損失，更可不負政府當局關懷氏生之熱誠，而統一幣制，安定金融之國策，亦可賴以完成。周財長為此特發表聲明如次：</p>
<p>周財長聲明</p>
<p>查淮海省內中央儲備銀行券與中國聯合準備銀行券，全面交換限期截至本年四月三十日止，業已屆滿。上項交換事宜，本部迭據報稱，過去成績尚屬覺良，惟因該省轄境遼國，偏遠各地人民，狃於竣，茲篇顧全該省人民利益起見，特將上項全面交換限期。依照下列辦法酌予延展：　在淮海省主要各城市如徐州·海州·宿縣·連雲港·等四處，延展至本年五月三十一日止，並自六月一日起，實行禁止中國聯合準備銀行券之使用　其他淮海省內各地區，延展至本年九月三十日止。並　十月一日起，實行禁止中國聯合準備銀行券之使用。以上辦法為關於進海省內聯銀券之最後措置，務　切實　行，於交換期內，連將所有聯銀券悉數交換，勿再觀望自誤，是所至要。至此次交換期問，雖經延長，但自五月一日起，所有淮海省內中央地方各機關，及國營事業之收支，一　以中儲券為單位，不再便用聯銀券。其他淮海省內金融機關，原係用聯銀券之存款借款，應一律按照十八元對一百元之此率，改訂為中儲券，又以聯銀券立約這一般　權債務，亦應依上項比率，改訂為中儲券，若未邀照改訂者，此後一概作為改正論。除呈報及分行外，特此鄭重聲明。</p>
<p>日使館聲明</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　國府財政當局以淮海省中儲券與聯銀券之全面交換期間，至西月底已吿屆滿，為體恤商民起見，特決定延長其交換期問。日方對我政府此舉，莫不一致加以協助，茲日駐華大使館關於此事，特於三十日發表談話，表示協助之意，其大意如次：「淮海省中儲券與聯銀券之全面交換期問，於四月三十日屆滿，茲國民政府為體恤商民計，決定在主要都市，如徐州·海州·連雲·及宿縣等，將全面交換期間延長一月，其他各地域，則延長五月。期滿後上開各主要都市，於六月一日起，其他各地則於十月一日起，禁止使用聯銀券。國民政府日前曾發表，堅持中儲券對聯銀券百元折合十入元之比率，並取消南北匯款之限制，今又採取此種措置，足證國府通貨政策發展之健全，殊堪　習，而日方目將盡量予以協力。</p>
<p>取消匯兌限制促進物資交流</p>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　關於促進南北問物資交流之圓滑問題，固有待於增加生產，暢通運輸等等根本問題之速決，而後始克收取划期效果。惟以往兩地間金融不能得有適當而合理之調節，亦為妨碍物資暢流之一大原因。蓋金融調節欠暢，一切政治經濟均因之而形成聯　，不期因而構成地城觀念。國府財政當局有鑒於此，乃對南北間之金融調節工作，力求合理之融通，將兩地間之匯款限額逐漸提高至五千元，幷在滬指定若干銀行，專理中儲券與聯銀券兌換事宜，實施以來，於調節金融上收效殊宏。茲為財政當局完成預定目標，促進其更進一步之圓滑起見，斷然將南北間匯兌限制予以取消，今後不論多少一任自由通匯，消息傳出，兩地商民無不異常振奮。蓋此舉實行後，可促進物資交流之更趨圓滑，兩地經濟關係之日臻密切，而商民經濟活動亦將愈益活潑矣。</p>
<h3>德國慶紀念　汪主席電賀</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　五月一日為德國國慶紀念日，汪主席特電賀希特勒元首，茲誌原電如次：德國元首希特勒閣下，欣逢貴國國慶紀念，本人茲向閣下敬伸　摯賀忱，並祝政躬康泰，責國國運昌隆，中華民國國民政府主席汪兆銘。</p>
<h3>日軍對伊姆法爾　縮小包圍圈　敵大軍已成袋中之鼠</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　據印度前線三十日電，由於巴列爾之垂危，伊姆法爾南方各防禦據點，刻已莫不皆感危急。現於伊姆法爾之敵第四軍聽於大會戰之日迫　，刻正急於周圍修築陣地中，更由於日印盟軍自南方不斷之進攻，敵已驚慌失色，蓋敵數萬大軍因日軍包圍嚴密，退路全失，已成袋中之鼠，其軍士氣早已不振。更因日軍縮小包圍　形勢之危急，已刻不容緩，現正強制印度兵及運用大量戰車砲火，集中伊姆法爾北方陣，擬由哥希馬·伊姆法爾間公路之山谷地帶突出重圍，但於數次猛列攻擊之結果，終因日軍到處截　，徒受重大犧牲而已。</p>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　印度前線電：巴列爾前方陣地抵抗中之敵軍，已於廿六日開始退却，伊姆法爾防衛陣地，已呈先自南方崩潰之勢。日軍精銳部隊現正於庫奴達（巴列爾北方七公里）卡庫萊（巴列爾西北七公里）地方出沒中，又出現於巴列爾，伊姆法爾間公路之敵軍，現正使有力部隊待機於巴列爾北方十五公里之林　，並於羅庫達克湖南端之伊昂，集結　有重砲山砲之有力部队，以期防止日军追擊。又伊姆法爾北方山岳地帶，兩軍仍　續作戰中，伊姆法爾陷落之最後一戰，現在　全戰　漸次展開中。</p>
<h3>美機襲九江　被擊落七架</h3>
<p>漢口三十日中央社電　港美空軍機（P40）弄機六架，（P51）型一架，（P38）型機九架之　隊，於二十九日下午零時襲九江地區，是時日戰門機隊，遂于二套口（九江西南六公里）上空邀擊之，經猛烈空戰後，擊落其（P38）型機二架，（內不確者一架）繫毀（P38）型機三架，及（P40）型機二架，共計七架。而　得莫大戰果，嗣後日機全部安返基地。</p>
<p>日機襲玉山</p>
<p>漢口三十日中央社電　日轟炸機編隊，曾于二十九日上午，空襲江西省玉山機塲，全彈命中　理渭走路，此日渝軍對空砲火極猛烈，日機事畢，全部返防。</p>
<h3>糧食部　今併歸實部　蘇省拘捕投機米商</h3>
<p>南京三十日中央社電　糧食部自經國府明令撤消後，運日該部正趕　結束事宜，茲悉於五月一日正式併歸於實業部。所有前糧食部職員，　量安　於實業部內工作，聞　逾額而被裁職之職員，當局將酌予遣散費，詳細辦法現正　密擬其，將於日內公佈。</p>
<p>蘇州三十日中央社電　蘇省陳省長前為安定民生，抑平米價起見，特將操縱米市之米商盤據所在之萬昌茶室封閉。嗣經該茶室一再呈請啓封，姑予復業，並規定米商不得再行抬高米價，豈料連日各該米商竟故態復萌，們盤據該茶室，專事操縱米市。事被省警局查悉，乃誣倪局長於今晨九時半，派徐科長親牽長　，赴該處調查，果見米商蝟集如雲，公然交易。乃將全部米商一百廿八入，一俳拘局審問。經訊後，除一部份米商情節似較輕微者，姑予交保釋放外，其餘尚在縝密訊問中。</p>
<h3>日滿實行　撤廢關稅</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日滿兩國政府為促進兩國間物資交流之圓滑，　協　後，對撤廢兩國間關稅問題，彼此意見已一致，兩國政府並於二十九日正式發表。據此問經濟界人士對此　話稱，此次日滿兩國互相免除生　員關稅，並簡化貨客運輸資金等手續，此實係增加運輸交易速率，增強戰力之最有效措置。滿洲建國十二年來，早己成為大東亞中有力之食糧興重工業基地，尤其於日滿間運輸日繁。增產物炎。增強戰力之今日於經濟界尤，尤其於交通界視為最大阻碍之關稅問題，實早已有撤廢之必要。於此戰局日益苛烈中，己益使吾人痛感時間之重要性，敵人亦正盛唱不假時間予吾人之設，按於此所謂之時間，除係指時間之延長外，時問效率之增大亦有其特殊重要性。如常謂之時間緊迫，控制時間等即此也。日滿兩國當局此次措置，其　目的即在　使時間不為時間所限，吾人對比增強　力之新施策，實不勝贊同</p>
<h3>越督宣布　實行統制帆船</h3>
<p>西貢卅日中央社電美駐渝空軍為阻碍越南南北交通，於木年初即曾迭次轟炸縱貫越南之鐵路。越南當局為謀交通運輸之強化與安全，最近特以總督令宣布實行統制帆船，以謀加強沿岸航路，並次定由中越合辦新設帆船運輸公司，開設越南南北沿岸航路。</p>

<h3>米棉粉麥三委會　調整收買價格　以適合農民生活為標準</h3>
<p>自政府當局實施戰時經濟政策後，即由在滬金融工商各界　負聲望人士，組設全國商業統制總會，實施自治統制主要商品物資，公定價格，統一收配，如米·麥·油·糖·棉花等各種物資，均已分為業別，組成統制機構，專　辦理收買配給任務。經過一年來，統制成績雖　週密，然因環境之變化，收買配給價格，迭有影響，推進之工作，反覺陰滯生產之發展。故有關各當局有鑒於此，為推進收買物資，充實平衡之供配，除採取以物資交換制度強化收買工作外，並擬鼓勵農民增加生產，對於收買價格，決以適合農民生活程度調整之。據中央社記者分向各統制機關　悉，商統會以下之米糧統制委員會，棉花統制委員會，粉麥專業委員會，已分別以民生必需品之棉布·肥皂·洋燭·毛巾·火柴·糖·　·香烟等物品，向農民交換，收購米麥棉等三項民食民衣主要物資，實施以來，收買成績較前吏為良好。此外，為增加生產，順利推進收買物資，對於米麥棉三項物資收買價格，正在積極研究調整，以適合農民生活為標準，以鼓勵農民努力增加生產，而便推進收買工作。聞此次調整收買價格，決定本年新貨上市時實行云。</p>

<h3>This Newspaper Establishes a Science Prize</h3>
<p>This newspaper, for the purpose of promoting scientific research and rewarding scientific talent, has established a science prize. This matter has been considered for a long time, but since science is a specialized field of knowledge, the rewarding of science should be managed by experts. We consulted with the Shanghai branch of the Science Society of China, who especially supported it, and nominated committee members to organize a committee to manage the matter. The Science Society of China is the earliest and most established academic organization in China for promoting science, and the Shanghai branch is the largest group of scientists in Shanghai. With this assistance, this newspaper is determined to establish the prize. In addition to first donating 100,000 yuan as an initial encouragement, we are willing to bear all administrative expenses. We only hope that people from all walks of life will freely grant donations, so that the future results will certainly be significant. The organization of the committee and the prize regulations will be published in today's newspaper (see page 2). In the future, we also plan to successively hold various popular or specialized science lectures, conduct public science experiments, and publish science journals. We especially hope that scientific experts will provide guidance at any time to jointly promote progress. On the occasion of its establishment, we would like to present two principles to the people of the country: one is scientific construction, and the other is scientific spirit.</p>
<p>China is the country with the longest history in the world, but in the past hundred years, the country's status has almost fallen to that of a semi-colony. China is also the country with the largest land area in the world, but in the past hundred years, the clothing and food of the Chinese people have not been self-sufficient. Tracing the root cause, it is none other than the fact that material construction has not been able to keep up with others in every respect. Science is the driving force behind all material construction. Without science, material construction cannot be achieved. Therefore, the reason why our country's material construction has not been able to keep up with others in the past hundred years is that it lacks a scientific foundation. In the past, our country has not failed to mention scientific construction, but due to insufficient understanding and an excessive desire for quick results, it often ended up being a futile effort. Critics have said that the country is trying to revive everything, but nothing has been achieved. The reason is none other than the fact that it has not started with the fundamental scientific construction foundation. This newspaper is now rewarding science, willing to contribute its meager efforts to awaken the people of the country to start fundamentally with scientific construction, not seeking quick results or short-term gains, but taking a down-to-earth approach and striving for progress. It must be understood that the establishment of a modern country requires hard work and cannot be achieved through shortcuts and expediency. This is the first principle.</p>
<p>The success of modern natural science is a unique and epoch-making advancement in world history. Following the success of science comes the scientificization of the thinking of people around the world and the ability to apply scientific methods to handle affairs. This is what is called the scientific spirit. The scientific spirit has two characteristics: one is to seek truth and accuracy, and the other is to be orderly. This is very common in the eyes of those who have received scientific training, but among the general public, the number of people with a scientific mindset is still not large. Today, in our country, national opinions are divided, and national affairs are complex. However, if we analyze and dissect them according to scientific methods, then by stipulating steps and doing things realistically, the path to national construction is right in front of us. The most important task for us today is to enlighten the people's scientific thinking. We must start with everyday life and universally promote science to cultivate a scientific mindset. If all the compatriots in the country can receive scientific training and conduct themselves with a scientific spirit, then with the power of 450 million scientific minds, establishing a modernized Republic of China is not difficult. This is the second principle.</p>
<p>The importance of science is so great, and the promotion of scientific research is naturally urgent. With the limited strength of this newspaper, we dare not speak of promotion, but we hope that people from all walks of life will give more support so that the people of the whole country will value science and believe in science. This is what the colleagues of this newspaper are willing to devote their foolish sincerity to and dare to announce to the people of the whole country.</p>
<h3>Besieged by Internal and External Troubles, Britain's Anxiety Deepens</h3>
<p>Due to the government's unsatisfactory policies, many problems have arisen in Britain's domestic affairs. Therefore, in Churchill's previous broadcast, most of it covered domestic issues. Recent opinions in British newspapers and magazines, in addition to expressing dissatisfaction with the government's indecisive foreign policy towards the Soviet Union and the United States, have added difficult domestic issues. Many newspapers in London are frankly stating: "There are signs of war fatigue in Britain," especially the signs that can be seen in the working class are the most obvious, such as the recent frequent coal strikes. The British labor community believes that the current government will not be able to meet their social demands after all. The government has tried all kinds of countermeasures to stop the coal miners' strike, but it has not been able to do so. The 95,000 coal miners in Yorkshire went on strike on the 4th. According to news from London, the main reason for the strike was hunger due to insufficient food rations. The British magazine "The Sphere" describes the current mood of the British people:</p>
<p>"All the tragic aspects of the current war have appeared on everyone's face. The standard of morality has been severely shaken, and order and discipline have been destroyed. Many examples show a loss of true courage, and the tendency to be tired of war is gradually increasing. If we cannot win this year, the British people will continue the war, but the culture that remains will not be a great culture. Even if there is a victory, it will be a ruthless victory."</p>
<p>Criticism from the United States</p>
<p>It can be seen that the British people have lost concern for the direction of the war. In addition, the imperialist policies of the United States have given further stimulus, and the British people's anxiety about the future of Britain is increasing day by day. British journalists stationed in the United States often criticize the foreign policy of the United States. According to the British, the imperialist colors of the American capitalists are gradually becoming stronger, and the general public in Britain are shaking their heads and sighing. What exactly is Britain's war goal for? Moreover, the huge influence of the United States on Canada and Australia is also increasing day by day. Therefore, before the statement of the Director of the US Naval Ship Bureau, Cockrell: "The United States will have the largest navy in history after the war to protect world peace", the British people had already been paying attention to the constantly increasing numbers of American warships and worrying that Britain's marine dominance might be lost forever. The United States' oppression of Britain, relying on the Lend-Lease Act as a shield, is one of the reasons why the British government feels a headache.</p>
<p>Roosevelt, who was the Undersecretary of the Navy during World War I, knew the means of Britain. Now that he is the President, he will certainly not have the intention of Lend-Lease for free. According to reports, the purpose of US Secretary of State Stettinius's visit to Britain this time is to discuss the settlement of supplies provided under the Lend-Lease Act. Moreover, the issue of granting bases to the United States for naval and air forces is also feared to encounter a stalemate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the American side's criticism of the Dieppe Raid is also regarded by Britain as hurting its self-esteem. British journalists stationed in the United States are quite angry that the United States has not said a word about the British Navy's participation in the Pacific counter-offensive operations. Churchill has visited the United States repeatedly and toured the world, but why has Roosevelt never visited Britain once? Moreover, Roosevelt is expanding American power everywhere without consulting Churchill. What is Britain's position in Europe and its position towards the Soviet Union? There is no doubt that the British government's policies truly represent Britain's interests in Europe. The British people believe that the Soviet Union's impolite attitude towards Britain is a major crisis in Europe. Therefore, the rumor of Foreign Secretary Eden's resignation spread throughout Europe, and it was speculated that Beaverbrook would be his successor. Recently, the Soviet "Izvestia" criticized the changes in the Italian political situation, which are due to the different policies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, the British people's anxiety and wavering about the future of their country is increasing day by day. (Xiang: Translated from the 4th Day Western Asahi Shimbun)</p>
<h3>Huaiprovince Joint Bank and Reserve Notes: Full Exchange Period Extended until the end of May and September of this year</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): Since December 1st of last year, the currency within the Huaiprovince area has been used together with the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the original Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes, and it has been five months. The results are exceptionally good. Not only has the financial stability within the province been relied upon, and the convenience of materials has been balanced, but also the people's use has been convenient. In order to further complete the currency system unification work within the province, the Department of Finance and Chang began to stop the new issuance of Joint Reserve Bank Notes within the province on March 1st of this year. It was further stipulated that from April 10th to April 30th, the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank labor within the province would be fully implemented. The exchange ratio still insisted on the benchmark of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes for 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Since the full exchange was implemented, the situation has been quite good. As of the 30th yesterday, the exchange period has expired. After the original expiration date, the use of Joint Reserve Bank Notes should be prohibited, but because the province is vast and populous, and people in remote areas may still be accustomed to old habits and cannot implement the exchange as scheduled, the financial authorities have decided to extend the above-mentioned full exchange deadline in order to take care of the people's interests. It is stipulated that the main cities in the province, such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang, will be extended to May 31st of this year. From June 1st, all Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited from being used in the city and county. In other areas of Huaiprovince, the extension will be until September 30th of this year. From October 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will also be prohibited. Furthermore, it is stipulated that from May 1st, all income and expenditure of central and local government agencies and state-owned enterprises within the province shall be in Central Reserve Bank Notes, and no Joint Reserve Bank Notes shall be used. As for the deposits of other financial institutions, if they are not corrected after the deadline, they will all be treated as corrections. The financial authorities have resolutely extended the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes within the province. This measure is purely for the benefit of the people. In fact, the people in remote areas have the difficulty of not being able to complete the exchange on time. If they are not given accommodation, the loss and impact on the people's interests will be significant. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the authorities have resolutely extended the deadline, regardless of the administrative troubles of the主管 authorities. This is a clear proof of the government authorities' care for the people's hardships and concerns about the people's sufferings. Therefore, all the people in the province should admire the government authorities' intentions, and those who have not yet implemented the exchange should speed up the process and not hesitate to wait and see, so as not to cause the loss of the people's interests and to live up to the government authorities' enthusiasm for caring for the people's livelihood. The national policy of unifying the currency system and stabilizing finance can also be relied upon to be completed. Finance Minister Zhou specially issued a statement as follows:</p>
<p>Statement by Finance Minister Zhou</p>
<p>It has been found that the full exchange deadline for the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes in Huaiprovince has expired on April 30th of this year. The Ministry has repeatedly reported that the past performance of the above-mentioned exchange matters has been satisfactory. However, because the province is vast and the people in remote areas are accustomed to the old ways, in order to take care of the interests of the people in the province, the above-mentioned full exchange deadline is specially extended according to the following methods: In the main cities of Huaiprovince, such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Suxian, and Lianyungang, the extension is until May 31st of this year, and from June 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited. In other areas of Huaiprovince, the extension is until September 30th of this year. From October 1st, the use of Joint Reserve Bank of China Notes will be prohibited. The above methods are the final measures regarding Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince. It is necessary to implement them earnestly and exchange all Joint Reserve Bank Notes during the exchange period. Do not wait and see and delay yourself. This is very important. Although the exchange period has been extended this time, from May 1st, all income and expenditure of central and local government agencies and state-owned enterprises in Huaiprovince shall be in Central Reserve Bank Notes and no longer use Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Other financial institutions in Huaiprovince, whose deposits and loans were originally in Joint Reserve Bank Notes, should all be revised to Central Reserve Bank Notes according to the ratio of 18 yuan to 100 yuan. General claims and debts established in Joint Reserve Bank Notes should also be revised to Central Reserve Bank Notes according to the above ratio. If they are not revised according to the requirements, they will all be treated as corrections in the future. In addition to reporting and distributing, this is a solemn statement.</p>
<p>Statement by the Japanese Embassy</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): The National Government's financial authorities decided to extend the exchange period in order to take care of the merchants and people, as the full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince has expired at the end of this month. The Japanese side unanimously assisted the Chinese government in this regard. The Japanese Embassy in China specially issued a statement on the 30th to express its intention to assist. The general idea is as follows: "The full exchange period of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes in Huaiprovince expired on April 30th. Now, the National Government has decided to extend the full exchange period for one month in major cities such as Xuzhou, Haizhou, Lianyungang, and Suxian, and for five months in other areas in order to take care of the merchants and people. After the expiration, the use of Joint Reserve Bank Notes will be prohibited in the above-mentioned major cities from June 1st, and in other areas from October 1st. The National Government has previously announced that it will adhere to the ratio of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank Notes to 18 yuan of Joint Reserve Bank Notes and abolish the restrictions on remittances between the north and the south. Now, it has taken this kind of measure, which is sufficient to prove the sound development of the National Government's currency policy, which is worthy of learning, and the Japanese side will give as much cooperation as possible."</p>
<p>Abolish Exchange Restrictions to Promote Material Exchange</p>
<p>Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency): The smooth resolution of the issue of promoting the exchange of materials between the north and the south depends on the speedy resolution of fundamental issues such as increasing production and unimpeded transportation before a landmark effect can be achieved. However, the lack of appropriate and reasonable regulation of finance between the two places in the past is also a major reason for hindering the smooth flow of materials. Because the financial regulation is not smooth, all politics and economy are formed by this, and the concept of regionalism is formed. The National Government's financial authorities, in view of this, have strived for reasonable financing in the work of financial regulation between the north and the south, gradually increasing the limit on remittances between the two places to 5,000 yuan, and designating several banks in Shanghai to specialize in the exchange of Central Reserve Bank Notes and Joint Reserve Bank Notes. Since its implementation, it has had a significant effect on regulating finance. Now, in order to complete the planned goals and promote further smoothness, the financial authorities have resolutely abolished the restrictions on exchange between the north and the south. In the future, no matter how much, they will be allowed to freely exchange. When the news came out, the merchants and people of the two places were very excited. After the implementation of this measure, it can promote the exchange of materials to become smoother, the economic relations between the two places will become closer, and the economic activities of merchants and people will become more vigorous.</p>
