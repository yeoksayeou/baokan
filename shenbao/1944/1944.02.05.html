<p>社評</p>
<h3>多設醫工農專科學院</h3>
<p>盟邦日本衆院决算委員會於一月三十一汨開會時，討論學校的勸向問題。主要點有三：　增招醫科學生。　地方商業學校大部改爲工業學校，其他各校改爲農業舉校或女子商業學校，全國商業學校共計四百五十校，今預定改其中二百七十校爲工業學校。　工粱學校的設施努力活用旣有的設備，或利用其附近工業舉校所有的設備。（見二月二日本報）·這是戰時體制下的敎育改造，値得我們效法。</p>
<p>國家在戰爭時期，任何事業都只有一個簡明的目標，就是怎樣謀取戰爭的勝利。敎育事業的目的在培植人才，在戰時就要培植戰時所需要的人才。據盟邦日本所討論的主點，可以知道盟邦今後所最要造就的只是醫科工科農科三種專門人才。至於商業人才則女子的體力已足勝任，根本不必需要男子。重要的學科决定了，男女分科的區別亦决定了，此後依照這個計劃推行，個個學校都能造就所需要的人才，斗國家不致浪費金錢，國民不致浪費精力。</p>
<p>我們在「論人才的增產」一文裏（一月二十九日）會經說過：「培養新入才最重要的方法是有計劃的訓綀」，盟邦現在所討論的主點就是有計劃的訓練的原則。我們又會在同一文裹提出「在業訓綊」的方法，盟邦利用附近工業學校所有的設備，利用工，塲供給的設施，就是在業訓練的方法。我們所說的竟與盟邦所討論的不約，而同，我們更知道盟邦巳經依照了這個計劃實行，因此我們覺得我們政府當局更應該迫切地决定幷推行戰時體制下的敎育方針。</p>
<p>這個方針現在不必我們再來討論了。在大東亞一體之下，大東軍範園內任何一個國家所需要的人才，也就是我們中國所需要的人才。盟邦在醫工農三科方面，過去已是人才濟濟，現在還要竭力增進，那末，素來缺少醫工農專門人才的中國，亳無疑義地，更應當特別的注意。所以醫工農三科敎育的促進，是盟邦的敎育方針，也就是我們今後的敎育方針。</p>
<p>要實行實行個方針，最簡單的便是多設立醫工農專科獨立戰院。年來敎育部對於大學的重建，極爲努力，如中央大學，上海大學，浙江大學和最近即將恢復的武漢大學等等。可是大學分科多，經費鉅，籌備難。獨立學院就比較容易建立。附近盤院的地方，就可設立醫學院；附近工廠的地方，就可設立工學院；附近農塲的地方，就可設立農學院。關於醫工方面，敵性的聲院和工廠很多已經交給我們政府管理，我們應常立即利用。關於農科方面，現在經過多年戰亂之後，荒地的利用，比較容易，新農塲的設立，亦較方便；此外，敵性的農產出品塲所有交給政府管理的，自然都可利用。獨立學院的行政要簡單化，獨立學院祇需要專門人才，不必有龐大的組織。獨立學院是敎育塲所，也是實習塲所，獨立學院要把社會和敎育打成一片，所以獨立學院的畢業生，立即成爲社會上有用的人才。</p>
<h3>日大本營昨發表　陸軍航空隊戰果　一月來墜毀敵機三百餘架</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日大本營四日下午三時三十分發表：日陸軍部隊於一月內邀擊或進攻敵航空部　所獲各戰果（包括已發表者）如次：　中國方面擎落十四架（內八架未證實），擊毀十架，我機自炸三架。　緬甸方面擊落二十九架（內十五架不證實），擊毀五架，日極自炸及未飛還者六架。　班達海方面舉落七架（內一架朱證實），擊毀兩架。　新幾內亞方面擊落百六十二架（內四十五架未瞪實），擊毀起火者四十二架，日機自炸及未飛還者十一架，並重傷起火者二十架。　波根維爾　及　斯麥群島擊落七十三架（內十一架未證實），擊毀十九架，共計擊落擊毀三百七十三架（內七十八架未蹬實），日機損書四十架。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電　日陸軍機　及防空部隊，運日來於北千島架。南太平洋及印緬邊境至中國大陸間，迎擊來襲之敵機，日夜　戰，總計於一月中，共攀落敵機二百九十五架，並擊毀其七十八架，而獲得莫大戰果，蘇將各綫戰况如次：　日本土北方敵棧時冒惡劣氣候，從事偵察工作，　作小規模另散之空襲。　中國方面，重慶空軍於捷諾特之作戰指揮下，對日軍佔領地區，作遊擊式之空襲，己漸成過去，一月中來襲之渝機，峻十二月時已減少甚多，僅有一百六十架，此或係受惡劣氣候之影饗，致使彼等難以任意蠢動，其間被日軍擊落十四架，擊毀十架。　緬甸方面，敵機之活動情形，與去年十二月時相同，時對日軍第一綫及後方兵站綫作發作　之轟炸，尤以日溪方面之活動日益激烈，總計於一月中共被日方擊落三十九架，被擎毀五架。　新幾內亞方面敵軍，企圖奪還馬當之戰意益趨積極，敵以地上部隊，東方自宮比角，南方自拉姆阿河谷進攻馬當，目前在激戰中。同時，敵空軍之空襲亦益形激烈，一月中來襲之敵議數目爲三千二函架，較十二月已增至二倍强，日軍共擊落其百六十二架，擊毀其四十二架。　波鳥方面，一月中來襲之敵機雖較十二月減少，然尙有五千架之多。　俾斯麥羣烏馬加斯角及克羅斯角方面敵陸空軍之進襲仍極熾烈，十二月及一月共有敵機二千七百架來犯。又波島及傳斯麥島之戰區方面，共被日方擊落共七十一二架，擊毀其十九架。</p>
<h3>大東亞縱貫鐵路各種施策進行中　山本次官發表建設計劃</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電日鑒員田中伊三次氏，二日會於衆院預算委員會東京·昭南之大東亞縱貫席間發表，希望建設連擊鐵路。當由山本大東亞省次官答稱：現日政府正與關係各國緊密運絡，爲達成該目的，正進行各種施策，且已有相常進展。茲誌該鐵路建設計劃槪要如次：「該鐵路路錢係以東京爲起點，經下關·釜山·奉天·天津·南京·上海·街陽·廣州·南寗·鎭南關。河內。西實·（或河內·普那塔·察肯·　谷）至昭南止之路綫，其中未設者。係自農東起至南寗。鎭南關間及西貢至百因奔問（或普那塔至空育問）其中之距　爲六百四十公里）二七○五公里，此綫如能完成，則自東京經西貢至昭南島之路程，共需九日十一小時零三十分，如經空肯則共需八日三小時○四十分。至於其間之資材及勞力，則應由有關各國共同協力，傳以輪助，又全綫費用之預算約七入十憶元，完成期間需五六年，此在建設大東亞及完成大東亞建設上，實屬絕對必要者，而且對有關各國生產時之開發，交通機關之整頓，及安定民生等。均有莫大之影響。又四日眾院决算委員會席上，三浦鐵這總局施設局長特就議員田中伊三氏對關釜海底　道所提之質問，答復如次：關於關鍵海底隧道之問題，目前正在調查中，關於地　及圖面調查自大東亞戰爭爆發以來，因種種原因，致使調查工作難以　利進行，然至昭和十九年度則有相當數目之預算，以供調查工作之用，遂又由地質開掘縱坑橫坑而進行調查事宜，預定於最短期間內調查完畢，迄現在止，如就調查之結渠言之，在技術上已無困難之成分存在矣。</p>
<h3>日貴族院昨開全體會通過各項要案</h3>
<p>東京四日中央社電日貴族院四日上午十時召開全體會議，審議衆院送來之預備金支出案及其他六件、由政府說明理由後、交赤字委員　　查？嗣鐵道數設戰時特例等兩法案，昭和十九年度發行充當一般會計歲出之公債案，及其十一案件議案等，均予通過。上午十時預算第一二三四五各分科會及增稅赤字之各委員會舉行會議。又衆議院四日並未召開全體會議，僅於上午十時召開决算建　戰時保險及關於農林中央金庫等各委員會。</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電日衆議院三日之决算委員會席上，　員金光　三會謂：「爲實行大東亞共同宣言，爲使共榮圈各國之國民運勸擊密連舉，當局之意見如何」？對該質間，由山木大東亞省次宮說明如次：大東亞共同宜言，並非僅爲宜言，最切要者在於實行，但寶行亦非僅在各政府間之有連繫，必須使各國民撤底理解此宜言之趣旨，使各國國民運動保持聯繫。故今後大東亞諸國之國民運動，必須以之爲實現大東亞共同宣言之運動，又於思想方面及實際運動之形式上，應集中於統一方式下，此並不僅於一國實行，各國鈞應以此情神官施國民運動·並須使此遝動問之提攜與政府間之提攜同樣緊密，且須以堅固之運動進行。宣言發表以後，日本寶行一切寶踐大東亞室言之施策，並對各國時當進行連絡。</p>

<h3>雲南前綫近況談</h3>
<p>西望印展，北　重廢，　罩細甸的戰雲，新春以來，日趨　張。記者訪間在高黎黃山脈或怒江最前綫的將士，舉行座談會，而得以傾聰了扼守雲南前綫的將士之决意。</p>
<p>勝利的關鍵</p>
<p>○○部隊長：這雲南的新戰塲是擊減重慶的關鍵，也是戰勝次東亞戰爭的國鍵。　雲南也可以說是從中國事變到大東亞戰爭之飛躍的戰爭性質之縮圖。一年餘來繼續作不能實現的美夢之陳　，被我去秋的雲南作戰驚醒了，而不能不出於辭職的一。以練誠篇遠征軍總司令，一年餘來希望重開緬甸路重　方面，經此打聲、受到極大的影　。據從第一綫後退而從本再建的敵三十四年師長向市慶軍事當局的留告，　南戰役中所受的損失，兵員損耗稱有七千五百名。這對於一師抵有八千至一萬的渝軍，　然是職滅的打擊。代陳誠的衞立煌、無論在其戰爭經騐上，作戰策略，均非陳鐵之比，　也可見渝軍方面的蜀中無大將，　化作先鋒了，</p>
<p>○○大尉：敵軍的態勢，與其說要進攻細甸，不如說汲汲於防衛我進攻內地。而最感練手的是軍器的不足與新兵的募　。在這境况下，電慶遠征軍竟還要擴　　愈南方面，因而其防衛動力愈感因分散而削弱。在華中方面，第六戰區潰不成軍，而反攻細甸之夢，亦似身邊火燒一樣狼狽·然堪注目者，是最近流傳的美國式裝備之問題，與美國式訓練之澈底化間期。最近新設美國式幹部訓練圑，以蔣介石爲圑長，迅速訓練三個師的兵員，投靠於美國·對於這一支軍隊，倒須相當注意·</p>
<p>○○中對：研究歸順逃亡將士的原因，就可以知道敵軍將士不平不減的麼　空氣。　如有智識的兵土們都異口同聲的說不明戰爭目的。最近的中日新關係，在重慶方面不很明白知這，所以他們聰到這　情事。試說：」我們已經厭倦戰爭了。給養的惡劣不必說　日木軍是所向無敵、在滔錢則之前、無論怎樣戰。結果終是失敗。」</p>
<p>○○中尉：據當地所得情報、沈康，大理，昆明等地的物價，昂騰至怒江作騐前去年十月的二倍，中國裝一套從三千元到四千元，火柴一食二十元，　鞋一聲八十元。昆明的近况，　　　一樣荒凉，物俱急　到戰前的七十倍至百二十情。靈南的前綫基地保山，完全變成　軍的　　之地，　行，掠奪時有所聞、最近又惴揣於「日軍進攻」而感到不安，發生動搖·</p>
<p>○○中尉：怒江渡河則在目前。酒滔而流的怒江奔流，汹湧奔喘的怒江激流，怒江者，實即發怒驚的一條大河·在這大河邊的一切渡河點，均巳在我掌中，進攻昆明的準備，業已究成，花在充滿着自偣待機中。</p>
<p>○○部隊長：雲南的世界是空輿山，恰似大海中袛有空與潮一樣·昔日的援蔣緬甸路，坦蕩直向昆明。以前的重慶運輪路·現在變成　　慶死命的日軍進攻路·前綫將士們都抱着「不勝不歸的决心」。到雲南來的將士們，從雲南燃起了激烈的鬥，要解决中國事變。（翔，譯自一男二十五日西部朝日新開）</p>

<h3>西班牙閣議決定仍保持絕對中立　武力為後盾維護國家尊嚴</h3>
<p>德里四日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：弗朗哥元首於昨午後召集閣議，討論國際局勢，當即議决維持絕對之中立，並不惜於必要時以武力維護之·關於此事，頃由西副教育部長發表文告如下：「本政府曾召集會議，討論外長所發表有關本國之目下國際局勢，西國决仍如前維持絕對之中立，此為本政府巳證實者。本政府巳準備以鄭重之態度，要求全國人民暨外僑完成中立之義務。同時並已準備於任何壓力之下，拒絕放棄中立之脅迫。西班牙之中立乃其絕對之主權，勢必為各國所尊重者，本政府並已檢查一切必要之防禦措置，以便保護中立之尊巖。西國一向同情過阻戰爭之擴大，此為西國將以極冷靜之熊度及愛國心應付一切困難之保證。本政府享受絕對之信任，蓋以尊重獨立而言，官民已打成一片也。</p>
<p>西國下月舉行總選確立應付現局對策</p>
<p>沮里克四日中央社電現英美兩國對西班牙加重壓迫，瑞士電報通訊社於二日指摘蘇聯亦與英美携手強壓西國，謂蘇聯各報現以西政府及羅馬教廷之軸心色彩甚濃為理由，頻行攻擊西國，蘇聯漫畫家亦痛烈非難西班牙之中立。又據瑞士報之消息稱，西駐英大使阿爾巴公爵巳於一日返抵瑪德里，即將英美政府之要求，手交外長　爾得那。傷西政府須於數日中答覆該要求。巴斯拉新聞報倫敦特派員亦謂，英外相艾登近與阿爾巴會見時，會以極明確之言辭，西國接受英方之要求，然英國似因恐出以強硬態度而使西國態度硬化。據英國電訊交換社通信記者消息：英外相艾登以英駐西大使霍爾與弗朗哥會談結果類小　滿，發表會談經過徒刺激英西間之感情，故已央定中上下院報告西班牙問題。傳西政府預定於三月一日舉行總選舉，屆時當可確立西班牙應付戰爭現階段中之國策。</p>
<h3>日政府加強學生軍事教育　文部省發表要綱</h3>
<p>東京四日中央電社日政府於去年十月舉行閣犧時，會决定關於教育之戰時非常措置方策。日文部省茲為適應學生出征徽兵年齡之減縮等當前實情，以謀整備加強軍事教育起見，於去年底以來，即與陸海兩軍當局緊密連絡之下加以研究，茲以商得成案，於四日舉行之閣議時，由岡部文相加以說明後即行决定，並於下午三時由文部省發表加強「學生軍事教育要綱。一茲誌其要點如次：一加強學生軍事教育要綱」之意義，在刷新並準備過去學校所實施之軍事教育內容，而謀澈底完成基礎訓練。對大學高等專門學校等，謀提高其必要之指揮能力，而養成初級士官，對特定之一部學生，強化航空訓練，機械訓練等特別訓練，積極訓練决戰下之學生，以期增強戰力並决定添軍事教官時問，授以兵器學及軍陣醫學等。兵器學包括戰術戰史等軍事學。槍砲彈藥化學·兵器·汽車·戰車。軍用運信器·飛行機。電波兵器之搆造·機件修理及調整等。軍陣醫學係為醫科系之學生而設，包括衛生勤務。防空救護·健兵對策。航空醫學等。因此教練時間，理工科系學校增加五成以上，法文科系則增加十成以上。</p>
<p>兵務局長發表談話</p>
<p>東京四日中央社電日文部省長於當前時局决定強化學生軍事教育，軍事當局對此，亦抱有莫大期待。陸軍省那須兵務局長頃特發表談話謂。。處此決戰情勢下。學校教所育負使命極為重大，學校應於國家之要請，時局之需要，秉作為國軍預備學校之觀念，貫徹軍事教育。此次發表之強化軍事教育措置中，最值注意者即軍事教育非僅強化軍事訓練，實須奉戴賜於軍人之勅諭，自精神教育以至一般學科，均大量採取積極之軍事教材，與軍訓相輔而行，以增強學生之戰力，實施文武如一之教育，至於使此次措置迅速收獲劃期成果，職司教育之人員實負有一部責任，學校當局固當深刻省悟學生軍事教育，然學校教育中現戰局下特別重要之部長，即負責監督指導之各位，亦當明於大勢，率先領導督勵學生，以期完成决戰。</p>

<h3>東綫蘇軍展開全面攻勢　羅威諾德軍撤退</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電德元首行營三日發表：蘇軍於普貝特沼澤地帶反覆攻擊，德軍於該地西北方展開熾烈之防禦戰後，已自羅威諾及盧特克撤退</p>
<p>柏林四日中央社電據海通社訊：東棧蘇軍全綫進攻，德軍防禦頗感困難，因冬季氣候溫和，前綫泥濘，摩托化部隊不能活動也。穌軍繼續增援，但遭德軍痛擊，迄未獲逞，因德軍於蘇軍壓力增加時，移至後方新陣地，然後反攻擊退蘇軍，旦奪回失地。例如東縷北部，蘇軍在諾伏哥洛特以西衛入德軍陣地，巳被繫退。東綫北部戰況最劇烈，蘇軍在伊爾門湖與芬蘭　間增派生力軍助戰，蘇軍在那伐以東進攻多次，均被　退。諾伏哥洛特以西之蘇軍已無進展，蘇軍迫近愛沙擬亞邊境，愛沙尼亞己下令總動員，德軍防禦區域，將　愛軍之協助蘇軍在東綫中部增援進該攻，普貝特與貝萊西那問諾及魯特克後，已轉移新陳地。蘇軍在契爾喀賽以南，企圖突破德軍陣地，德軍坦克車部隊通緝蘇軍，發生據戰，涅波羅貝特羅夫斯克以南之蘇軍，企圖擴展缺口，但被穗軍機械化部隊擊退德軍在尼克珀爾橋頭堡南部反攻，填平缺口，蘇軍兵額雖眾，仍被德軍擊退。</p>
<h3>羅馬從受炮洗禮敎廷仍留梵蒂岡　敎皇離宮再度再炸</h3>

<h3>納吐諾戰況熾烈宛如人間地獄　炮聲震撼山</h3>
<p>柏林四日中央社電據海通社訊，德戰地訪員賈斯柏稱：納吐諾海灘戰爭激烈，不啻已成一火山，夜問天空紅似赤血，反軸心軍登陸之地，濃烟上冒，火勢甚熾，自納吐諾至羅馬之公路，則日夜受反軸心軍砲火之轟擊，其海軍砲火，亦助登陸部隊作戰。</p>
<p>羅馬四日中央社電海通社駐義戰地特派員魏勃宣稱：納吐諾方面激戰，現在齊斯迭那西南進行中。最近三日美軍雖一再猛攻該處德軍陣地，但迄未能進抵維亞阿比亞（Via、Appia）。美軍頭欲以任何代價，打通此一建於二千二百五十年前之著名公路，但至今維亞阿比亞仍在德軍手中。美軍先　隊惠衝抵該公路附近，當已發現德軍防務之強，而必覺極難獲得進展。</p>

<p>英美軍準備新登陸行動</p>

<h3>德蘇戰線最近形勢</h3>
<p>突破德軍的列寗格勒包國陣，於一月二十四日收復該城南方三十公里普許金的紅軍，向西南進繫，迫近通愛沙尼亞，立陶宛的鐵道要衝克拉斯諾格維爾捷斯克及拉脫維亞國境，向普斯可夫推進。在伊爾門湖方面梅萊契可夫將軍麾下的紅軍，與科威洛斯將軍　下列寗格勒方面紅軍的攻勢相呼應，亦開始攻勢。因此，穗軍乃撤退諾伏格洛特。這樣，紅軍對林台曼，屈塞勒兩將軍麾下德軍的反攻，獲得第一步的戰果。此後的戰略日標，似在於里加。</p>
<p>南綫暫呈膠著</p>
<p>據中立國方面的觀測，紅軍現在在北部戰區的攻勢企圖，第一，在解列甯格勒之圍；第二，欲轉變德軍的目光使向北方。最近北部戰局活潑化的結果，東部戰錢的中心，從南部戰區移到北部，在南部戰區，因孟許坦因元帥的反攻，暫呈膠着狀態。</p>
<p>但專門家的觀測，東部戰綫的主要舞台，依然在南部戰綫，决不陷於膠着狀態。該方面紅軍的攻勢因為被阻，乃不得不在維尼茲區域取守勢。紅軍的企圖，欲在此方面截斷德軍在烏克蘭與波蘭的聯絡。</p>
<p>據交換通信莫斯科電：孟許坦因軍在維尼茲區以戰車，步兵四師團對伐茲金左翼開始大攻勢，伐茲金軍以砲兵數師團應付德軍攻擊。目前正在激戰中。</p>
<p>這樣。孟許坦因軍在此地又再現了先前在頓河河套所顯示的奇蹟，從最前錢的尼可波里橋頭堡起，經克里伏伊洛格，特尼泊爾的河套，至普利匹契沼澤的南部前綫，確保了德軍防衛綫，但許孟坦因軍的任務，毋寗說尚在方興未艾，蓋孟許坦因軍的牴抗一告終，伐茲金軍的攻擊預料即將開始，要使德軍處於守勢，必須不斷的努力，所以現在紅軍試對西方的普里匹契沼澤地帶進攻。德軍正在據有力陣地阻止其進攻。故南部戰區的德軍前綫，孟許坦因軍在目前確保中的要衝維尼茲地方，很可以抵抗一陣。</p>
<p>德軍抵抗增大</p>
<p>中立國各報稱：「東部戰錢全綫的膠着狀態，益形顯著，德軍的抵抗在增大中」。但「現在的膠着狀態，究竟是否係紅軍冬季攻勢的結果所造成的最後階段呢？還是對孟許坦因軍與波蘭開始攻擊前的暫休狀態？」這一點成為問題。</p>
<p>最近德軍事消息靈通方面所表示下面的見解，頗堪注目：</p>
<p>「紅軍更將繼續攻擎，德軍的撤退亦在預料中。但紅軍對德軍的內縷防衛開始决定的進攻時，决不能說就是德軍全部戰綫的崩潰。」（翔：譯自一月二十入日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>海軍  岩田豐雄著　洪羊譯　　昭和十一年的新年來了，質人巳經十八歲了。　　年底的學科考試，好像吃了太多的黏樣似的，還殘留在肚襄，但是他抱着大西鄉主義，靜待天命。雖然是這麼說，但是這種妄念，總也驅除不了，因為雖然四天的考試都安然過去，仍然不免要被淘汰，這種前例也很多。　　正月二日，他訪問隆夫的家庭，看到隆夫的態度，意外地倒很安靜。　　「我已經看眼科醫生了……」議夫沈靜地說着，據說他所以到眼科醫生那襄去看的動機，是發見了雖然視力不好，也可以作海軍軍官的方法。眼科醫師，果然診斷說他是近視和輕度的亂視。但是在聽夫這是意料中的事情，所以並不驚異的。「沒有帶眼鏡就不能作海買軍官的道理……。我已經　念了兵科，想着入經環學校。眞人，——我無論如何，是一定要坐軍　的！」　　他的臉充滿了激情在戰勸着。　夫是這樣地愛海——海軍，道是傎人所沒意想到的。他反倒對自己感到鯈愧。　　不久，正月已過去，又到紀元節了。傎人在學校的儀式究畢後，回到家中，為想到隆夫的家襄去，正出門口的時候，送常綴的信差來了。　　「谷　人先生，電報！」　　接到給自己的業綴，這是有生以來的第一次，他戰戰競競地打開電報紙一看：　　——海兵合格－委員長　　是從海軍省教育局來的電報。剎那閱眞人的腦海褒感到無限的空虛，眼睛甚麼也看不見了。　　「媽媽……」他好容易地將這個電　給他母親看了。　　「四吉兄回來的時候，請吿訴他吧」！說着傎人就跑到外邊去了。忽然想到給已經落第了的隆夫看，這太不好意思了。倒不如向在紀元節的祝賀會，還剩襄學校的諸位先生，傳達這個吉報　　在教員室裏，前而擺着赤飯的包兒一排着地坐在那裏。　　眞人第一先將電報交給了校長先生。生這個時候，得到同樣電報的熊澤，也跑到了。緒方先生站起來擁抱着他們兩個人。　　軍人班的四年生，出了兩名海兵，一名陸兵的入學者。那勇敢的小森，就是屬於後者的。並且和第二年的人數總合起來，陸軍二十一，海軍入，一共二十九名的入學者。這確是輝耀全國的好成續。河田校長，諸方先生的鼻子好像父長出兩三寸似的。　　四號學生（一）　　「開一個入　祝賀會，你對怎樣？」隆天在上午十點鐘前後，討來打夥傎人。因為自己已經變更志願入經理學校，所以他的煩惱也解除了，對好友的獲得榮躍，誠意地想為他致賀。　　「不用，那種舉勸，用不着！」　人一邊笑着搖着手。　　總而言之，我們天文館大衛去看！」隆夫無論如何也要呌傎人到外邊去。　　二人走到在二月來的已經完全帶有春的消息的街頭上來了。梅花都全開了，隔牆看到的櫻花花蕾也待要開的樣。　　「我家的收晉機，早起就聽不見，早操也沒有做。」　　「大概機械有病了吧。」對隆夫的訊問，眞人這樣地回答着。　　　李阿毛　衛生信箱　　投函詢問病症寄白克路二五〇號　　（求救者問）略（答）　服九福大補素片　能復原　半年　亦能補助。　　（王自美問）略（答）　注射人工合成男性荷爾萌　二十針左右。　　（葉鐵生問）略（答）　注利　富人工血淸　請醫檢騐小便內究有何物　　（程志俊問）略（答）　有影響　服藥無效，宜割　盤　運動　不能　　（施益銘問）心劇跳，呼吸有阻碍，跳過後，胸部微痛，何病？（答）或係心與肺有不正常關係，速有X光檢驗，騐後再行施治。　　（龍平問）　常年易患傷風，醫治無號　效何故　疥瘡用何藥（答）　鈣太少也，注射克癆鈣有確效　用　金生氏欶　擦之　　（一個讀者問）　體胖，注射甲狀腺製劑，確有效否　注射幾針？注射何處？有危險否　價約若干　請介紹一醫師　注射後永不發胖否（答）　有　須經醫師禮體格而決定，肌肉，無危險　時價不同，約二一十元　同孚路二一八號傳中明　能國民論壇南通土紗槪况  汪仲威　　我續過朱楊兩君在太欄發表關於土紗問題的信，鄙人業此，已有一年，茲願將江北首縣的南通土紗業概況，一呈述於有心人士之前。　　南通整個市塲，素以花紗布為主要，尤以土布（關面布，大布，小布）關名全國。背大布經張賽先生之提倡，曾銷於東三省及關東各地，每年營業顯甚鉅。九一八後中止，後又經改良出品闊面布，花色不遜廠家出品，然均為鄉人手織，是以棉紗銷路甚大。往年有大生一廠二廠三廠及上海各廠供應，無慮缺乏，而構花出產豐富，色質俱佳。近年以來，吾國經濟統制，運輸阻滯，故客紗之供求不等，價昂而貨稀，是以土紗」乃新興事業之一，中下之家，老婦幼童，均以紡紗為不兄稀奇之事，經土紗業者之提倡，出品日佳，最好者與廿支十六支比美，實有過之。價格每市斤約八十至九十元，未及客紗之半，（二十支雙馬二千四百元，每小包九斤半，合每市斤二百五十餘元。）而好棉花之價只卅四五元，（棉統會定價約二十三元）紡成紗後，尚有倍餘之息，是以紡者日眾，出品日隆。南通全市每日產銷約在五千至一萬斤之間，買賣時間淸晨及午鄉人以之織布，遲銷於蘇北及淮海省間，營業不亞於當年關東貿易。　　江南土紗出品數景與品質諒均不及江北，但能研究改良，必不難並駕齊驅。而我國產棉區之能自紡自染自織者甚稀，倘荷有心人士提倡指導，非但對於農村經濟有所裨益，抑日解決當今衣布的問題，間接消滅今日紗布之恐慌，在此增產聲中，實有所希冀焉！願有力有心人十，急起圖之！社會服務愼防騙子上門　　上月廿二日有一年約卅左右，穿西裝革履之人，自稱孫姓名伯年，來敝處找鄙人云：係近由漢口來申，在漢陽縣立醫院做醫師，與小女同事，歷述小女此次長江路程中受炸及獲救生還回院情事，甚為符合。并云：此次來申是運X光機回漢及辦一切醫藥品，不日漢口有款數萬元來申，擬匯交鄙人收轉。鄙念既與小女同事，故竭力招待，渠又云省行李數件，在運輸公司，欲往提取之後，亦擬存敝處。淮現在缺少錢用，欲借用數千元，鄙人情面甚重，不疑共他，適上日薪水領到，即付渠收上千元，日恭敬送出門口，顧臨行時似覺慌張，令人生疑或是驅子。就即往追，巳不見矣，現時已多日，消息毫無，此乃騙子無疑。幷據友云現市上發現是種騙子甚多，受害者亦不少。希各界注意。再者該騙子消息不卜從何處而來，是否偷拆郵信而知，實一疑問耳。（徐光麟）保權工藝公司優待學生　　威海衛路五八七號保權工藝公司統辦中西文具學校用品·茲為響應本報助學金義舉並為減輕淸寒子弟家長之負擔起見，特贈本處優待卡三百張，轉送各助學金學生，凡持該項優待卡往公司購買任何學業用品，均得享受九折優待。（按該卡擬分送大學組獲助學生）　　徵工役　徵用工役一人，以自備脚踏車具有可靠保人者為合格，待遇一千四百元，供宿不供膳。願就者可至愛多亞路一六〇號上海新聞聯合會與狄君洽。冬賑捐款徵信錄　第十七號　　同潤錢莊代收錢莊業公會代募金大金源承餘承泰承豐怡大其昌其康宏發宏源辛大均泰安泰成豐年　存德存調均昌安裕安康至大光大企華企新同盛同發同潤同誠同與同　同康同春同成同大同一可大永益永盛敦裕順康順昌泰與通裕通沅盈豐盛大華昌寨琳泰來恒豐恒沅恆泰振豐祥康益中洪大振昶振泰振沅致祥信華裕信孚信和信成阜昌昇康茂豐春源信大信中長德長泰長春建昌怡和錦成興業興和衡豐衡通衡昶榮業嘉昶慶大慶成慶通衡孚聚豐聚德聚源聚甡聚康徵祥滋豐以上九十五戶各捐一千六百元共計十五萬二千元　　福源錢莊代收錢莊業公　代募　大廣瑞　業　興潤源匯大滋康愼餘愼德德豐康德德孚義昌義隆義豐德大德和德成義大源泰新康萬昌瑞裕瑞祥福來福源福順森泰開泰鉅大福華福康福利衆信道康萃康裕豐裕源惠昌永隆永餘永嘉永慶永祥永生永大元立成正豐裕正大元賚仁昶五豐五源正華正寗元盛元　元祥元昌元享元成天一天成天和天來中和壬康太昌大達大豐大成大和大茂大有大安久豐九福三泰一大寶豐寶泰寶甡寶通寶裕寶源寶與寶昌寶生豐裕鼎豐鼎康期昌　裕鴻安鴻裕濟源　祥以上九十七戶各捐一千六百元共計十五萬五千二百元以上總共計三十萬零七千二百元正通前總結存三百九十八萬二千零五十五元正</p>

<h3>Increase the Number of Medical, Engineering, and Agricultural Specialized Colleges</h3>
<p>When the Allied Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee convened on January 31st, it discussed the direction of schools. There were three main points: 1. Increase enrollment of medical students. 2. Most local commercial schools will be converted into industrial schools, and other schools will be converted into agricultural schools or women's commercial schools. Of the 450 commercial schools nationwide, it is now planned to convert 270 of them into industrial schools. 3. Make efforts to utilize existing facilities for industrial schools, or utilize the equipment of nearby industrial schools. (See this newspaper, February 2nd). This is an educational reform under the wartime system, worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>During wartime, any undertaking of a nation has only one clear goal: how to achieve victory in the war. The purpose of education is to cultivate talent; in wartime, it is to cultivate the talent needed for wartime. According to the main points discussed by Allied Japan, it can be seen that the only specialized talents Allied Japan most wants to cultivate in the future are in medicine, engineering, and agriculture. As for commercial talent, women's physical strength is sufficient to handle it, and men are fundamentally not needed. With the important disciplines decided and the distinctions between men's and women's disciplines also decided, if this plan is implemented thereafter, every school can cultivate the talents needed, so the nation will not waste money, and the people will not waste energy.</p>
<p>In the article "On the Increased Production of Talent" (January 29th), we said: "The most important method for cultivating new talent is planned training." The main points now being discussed by the Allies are the principles of planned training. We also proposed the method of "on-the-job training" in the same article. The Allies' use of equipment from nearby industrial schools and facilities provided by factories is a method of on-the-job training. What we said coincides with what the Allies are discussing. Furthermore, we know that the Allies have already implemented this plan. Therefore, we feel that our government authorities should more urgently decide and implement educational policies under the wartime system.</p>
<p>We don't need to discuss this policy again now. Under the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the talent needed by any country within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is also the talent needed by China. The Allies already have a wealth of talent in medicine, engineering, and agriculture, and they are now striving to increase it. Therefore, there is no doubt that China, which has always lacked specialized talent in medicine, engineering, and agriculture, should pay special attention. Therefore, the promotion of education in medicine, engineering, and agriculture is the educational policy of the Allies, and it is also our educational policy for the future.</p>
<p>The simplest way to implement this policy is to establish more independent specialized colleges in medicine, engineering, and agriculture. In recent years, the Ministry of Education has made great efforts in the reconstruction of universities, such as National Central University, Shanghai University, Zhejiang University, and the Wuhan University, which will soon be restored. However, universities have many departments, require huge funding, and are difficult to prepare for. Independent colleges are relatively easier to establish. Medical colleges can be established near medical facilities; engineering colleges can be established near factories; and agricultural colleges can be established near farms. Regarding medicine and engineering, many enemy-owned hospitals and factories have already been handed over to our government for management, and we should use them immediately. Regarding agriculture, after years of war, it is relatively easy to utilize wasteland, and it is also more convenient to establish new farms. In addition, enemy-owned agricultural product fields that have been handed over to the government can naturally be used. The administration of independent colleges should be simplified. Independent colleges only need specialized talent and do not need a large organization. Independent colleges are educational venues and also practical training venues. Independent colleges should integrate society and education, so that graduates of independent colleges immediately become useful talent in society.</p>
<h3>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announced Yesterday: War Results of the Army Air Corps: Over 300 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down in January</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 4th: The war results obtained by the Japanese Army units in intercepting or attacking enemy air units during January (including those already announced) are as follows: China front: 14 shot down (8 unconfirmed), 10 destroyed, 3 of our aircraft self-destroyed. Burma front: 29 shot down (15 unconfirmed), 5 destroyed, 6 Japanese aircraft self-destroyed or not returned. Banda Sea front: 7 shot down (1 unconfirmed), 2 destroyed. New Guinea front: 162 shot down (45 unconfirmed), 42 destroyed and on fire, 11 Japanese aircraft self-destroyed or not returned, and 20 heavily damaged and on fire. Bougainville and the Bismarck Islands: 73 shot down (11 unconfirmed), 19 destroyed. A total of 373 aircraft shot down or destroyed (78 unconfirmed), and 40 Japanese aircraft damaged.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese army aircraft and air defense units have been engaging enemy aircraft day and night from the Kuril Islands to the north, the South Pacific, and the Indo-Burma border to mainland China. In January, a total of 295 enemy aircraft were shot down and 78 destroyed, achieving great results. The battle situation on each front is as follows: In northern Japan, enemy aircraft braved adverse weather conditions to carry out reconnaissance work and small-scale scattered air raids. In China, the Chongqing Air Force, under the command of Chennault, has gradually moved away from guerrilla-style air raids on Japanese-occupied areas. The number of Chongqing aircraft attacking in January was much less than in December, only 160 aircraft. This may be due to the impact of adverse weather conditions, making it difficult for them to move arbitrarily. Among them, 14 were shot down and 10 were destroyed by the Japanese army. On the Burma front, the activities of enemy aircraft were the same as in December last year, launching bombings against the Japanese front line and rear supply lines. In particular, activities in the Nisshi area have become increasingly intense. In January, a total of 39 were shot down and 5 were destroyed by the Japanese side. In New Guinea, the enemy's intention to recapture Madang has become more active. The enemy is attacking Madang with ground troops, from Gombie Point in the east and the Ramu River Valley in the south. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting. At the same time, enemy air raids have become more intense. In January, the number of enemy aircraft attacking was 3,200, more than twice as many as in December. The Japanese army shot down 162 and destroyed 42. On the Bitoria front, although the number of enemy aircraft attacking in January decreased compared to December, there were still as many as 5,000. In the Bismarck Islands, the enemy's attacks on Cape Magas and Cape Cross by land and air forces were still very fierce. In December and January, a total of 2,700 enemy aircraft attacked. In the war zones of Bird Island and Transmail Island, a total of 712 were shot down and 19 were destroyed by the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Various Measures for the Trans-East Asia Trunk Railway are Underway: Vice Minister Yamamoto Announces Construction Plan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At a meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 2nd, Japanese Diet member Taniguchi Izo expressed his hope to build a railway connecting Tokyo and Shonan, the Trans-East Asia Trunk Railway. In response, Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Ministry of Greater East Asia replied: The current Japanese government is closely coordinating with related countries. In order to achieve this goal, various measures are being carried out and considerable progress has already been made. A summary of the railway construction plan is as follows: "The railway line starts from Tokyo, passes through Shimonoseki, Busan, Fengtian, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Jieyang, Guangzhou, Nanning, Zhennanguan, Hanoi, Xishi (or Hanoi, Phunat, Chakeng, Bangkok) to Shonan. The sections that are not yet built are from Nongdong to Nanning, Zhennanguan, and from Saigon to Baiinpen (or from Phunat to Kongyut), with a distance of 640 kilometers and 2,705 kilometers. If this line can be completed, the journey from Tokyo to Shonan Island via Saigon will take 9 days, 11 hours, and 3 minutes, and the journey via Kongken will take 8 days, 3 hours, and 4 minutes. As for the materials and labor required, they should be provided jointly by the countries concerned to assist each other. The estimated cost of the entire line is approximately 7 billion and 700 million yen, and the completion period will be 5 to 6 years. This is absolutely necessary for the construction of Greater East Asia and the completion of Greater East Asia construction, and it will have a significant impact on the development of production in related countries, the reorganization of transportation agencies, and the stabilization of people's livelihoods. Furthermore, at the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting on the 4th, Miura, Director of the Facilities Bureau of the Railway Bureau, replied to Representative Tanaka Iso's questions regarding the Kan-Fu undersea tunnel as follows: Regarding the Kan-Fu undersea tunnel, investigations are currently underway. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the investigation of the ground and the drafting of maps has been difficult to carry out smoothly due to various reasons. However, in fiscal year 19 of Showa, a considerable budget was allocated for investigation work, so the investigation was carried out by geological excavation of vertical and horizontal pits. It is planned to complete the investigation in the shortest possible time. As of now, according to the results of the investigation, there are no technical difficulties.</p>
<h3>The Japanese House of Peers Passed Various Important Bills at Yesterday's Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese House of Peers convened a plenary session at 10:00 AM on the 4th to deliberate on the reserve fund expenditure bill and six other bills sent by the House of Representatives. After the government explained the reasons, they were handed over to the Red Character Committee for investigation. Subsequently, two bills including the Railway Installation Wartime Special Exceptions Act, the bill for issuing public bonds to cover general account expenditures in fiscal year 19 of Showa, and eleven other bills were passed. The budget subcommittees 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the committees on increased taxes and deficits held meetings at 10:00 AM. Furthermore, the House of Representatives did not convene a plenary session on the 4th, but only convened the Budget, Construction, Wartime Insurance, and Agricultural and Forestry Central Bank committees at 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At the House of Representatives Budget Committee meeting on the 3rd, member Kanemitsu Sanmi said: "In order to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, what are the authorities' opinions on making the people's movements in the Co-Prosperity Sphere countries more closely linked?" In response to this question, Vice Minister Yamaki of the Ministry of Greater East Asia explained as follows: The Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is not just a declaration. The most important thing is to implement it. However, implementation is not only a matter of connection between governments. It is necessary to have the people of each country thoroughly understand the purpose of this declaration and to maintain contact between the people's movements of each country. Therefore, the people's movements in the countries of Greater East Asia must be movements to realize the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Furthermore, in terms of ideology and the form of practical movements, they should be concentrated under a unified method. This should not only be implemented in one country. Each country should promote national movements with this spirit, and the cooperation between these movements must be as close as the cooperation between governments, and must be carried out with a solid movement. Since the declaration was issued, Japan has been implementing all policies to practice the Greater East Asia Declaration and is conducting contact with each country when appropriate.</p>

<h3>Current Situation on the Yunnan Front</h3>
<p>Looking west towards India, north towards Chongqing, the war clouds covering Burma have been trending towards tension since the new year. Our reporter visited the soldiers at the front lines of the Gaoligong Mountains or Nujiang River, held a forum, and was able to hear the determination of the soldiers guarding the Yunnan front.</p>
<p>The Key to Victory</p>
<p>Unit Commander XX: The new Yunnan battlefield is the key to defeating Chongqing and also the key to winning the Greater East Asia War. Yunnan can also be said to be a microcosm of the leap in the nature of the war from the China Incident to the Greater East Asia War. Chen Cheng, who had been continuing to pursue unrealizable dreams for more than a year, was awakened by our Yunnan operation last autumn and had no choice but to resign. Lian Cheng became the commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force. Over the past year, his hope of reopening the Burma Road has been greatly affected by this battle. According to the retreat report to the military authorities by Xiang Shiqing, the commander of the 34th Division of the enemy, who retreated from the front line and rebuilt his strength, the losses suffered in the Yunnan campaign amounted to 7,500 men. This is a devastating blow to the Chongqing army, which has 8,000 to 10,000 men per division. Wei Lihuang, who replaced Chen Cheng, is not comparable to Chen Cheng in terms of war experience or combat strategy. This also shows that the Chongqing army has no great generals in Sichuan, and the military's vanguard has been transformed.</p>
<p>Captain XX: The enemy's situation is that they are more eager to defend against our attack on the interior than to attack Burma. The most difficult things are the lack of military equipment and the recruitment of new soldiers. Under these circumstances, the Chongqing expeditionary force is still expanding towards Vietnam, so its defense power feels more and more weakened due to dispersion. In Central China, the 6th War Zone was defeated and the dream of counterattacking Burma seemed as chaotic as a fire burning nearby. However, what is noteworthy is the issue of American-style equipment, which has recently been circulating, and the period of thorough American-style training. Recently, a new American-style cadre training regiment was established, with Chiang Kai-shek as the head, to quickly train three divisions of soldiers and rely on the United States. This army deserves considerable attention.</p>
<p>Middle Captain XX: By studying the reasons why surrendered and escaped soldiers returned, we can understand the uneasy atmosphere among the enemy's soldiers. The educated soldiers all said in unison that they did not understand the purpose of the war. Chongqing does not know much about the recent new relationship between China and Japan, so they heard about this situation. They tried to say: "We are tired of war. The poor supply goes without saying. The Japanese army is invincible. No matter how hard we fight before the power of money, the result is always failure."</p>
<p>Lieutenant XX: According to local intelligence, the prices of goods in Shenkang, Dali, Kunming, and other places are twice as high as last October before the Nujiang operation. A set of Chinese clothing costs from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, matches cost 20 yuan a box, and shoes cost 80 yuan a pair. The current situation in Kunming is as desolate as the war zone. The price of goods is seventy to one hundred and twenty times higher than before the war. Baoshan, the front-line base in southern Yunnan, has completely become a place for the Chongqing army's debauchery. Looting is often heard, and recently there has been anxiety about "the Japanese army attacking," causing turmoil.</p>
<p>Lieutenant XX: Crossing the Nujiang River is imminent. The Nujiang River flows with wine and tears, and the turbulent Nujiang River rages. The Nujiang River is truly a great river that roars and terrifies. All the river crossings on this great river are already in our hands. Preparations for the attack on Kunming have been completed. We are waiting in readiness, full of confidence.</p>
<p>Unit Commander XX: The world in Yunnan is only mountains and sky, just like the sea where there is only sky and tide. The former Burma Road that supported Chiang Kai-shek led straight to Kunming. The former Chongqing transportation route has now become the route for the Japanese army to attack Chongqing at the cost of their lives. The soldiers on the front line are holding the "determination not to return without victory." The soldiers who came to Yunnan ignited a fierce battle in Yunnan to resolve the China Incident.

<h3>Spanish Cabinet Decides to Maintain Absolute Neutrality While Using Force as a Backing to Uphold National Dignity</h3>
<p>Delhi, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Head of State Franco convened a cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the international situation. The meeting immediately decided to maintain absolute neutrality and will not hesitate to use force when necessary to maintain it. Regarding this matter, the Spanish Deputy Minister of Education issued a statement as follows: "The government convened a meeting to discuss the Foreign Minister's statement regarding the current international situation of the country. Spain has decided to maintain absolute neutrality as before, which has been confirmed by the government. The government is prepared to solemnly demand that the entire nation and foreigners fulfill the obligations of neutrality. At the same time, it is prepared to refuse to abandon neutrality under any pressure. Spain's neutrality is its absolute sovereignty, which must be respected by all countries. The government has also checked all necessary defense measures to protect the dignity of neutrality. Spain has always sympathized with preventing the expansion of the war. This is the guarantee that Spain will deal with all difficulties with extreme calmness and patriotism. The government enjoys absolute trust, and the government and people have come together to respect independence."</p>
<p>Spain to Hold General Election Next Month to Establish Countermeasures for the Current Situation</p>
<p>Zurich, 4th (Central News Agency) - As the United Kingdom and the United States are increasing pressure on Spain, the Swiss Telegraphic Agency pointed out on the 2nd that the Soviet Union is also joining hands with the United Kingdom and the United States to put strong pressure on Spain. It said that Soviet newspapers are now frequently attacking Spain, citing the Spanish government and the Roman Catholic Church's strong Axis colors as reasons. Soviet cartoonists are also severely criticizing Spain's neutrality. According to Swiss newspaper reports, the Spanish Ambassador to the United Kingdom, the Duke of Alba, returned to Madrid on the 1st and handed over the demands of the British and American governments to Foreign Minister Jordana. The Spanish government must respond to the demands in a few days. The London correspondent of the Basra News also said that British Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with Alba and made it clear that Spain should accept the British demands. However, Britain seems to be afraid that a tough attitude will harden Spain's attitude. According to a British telegraph exchange correspondent, British Foreign Secretary Eden was not satisfied with the results of the meeting between British Ambassador to Spain Hall and Franco. He said that the meeting only stimulated the feelings between Britain and Spain, so he had asked for a report on the Spanish issue to be submitted to the upper and lower houses. It is rumored that the Spanish government plans to hold a general election on March 1st, at which time the national policy for Spain to deal with the current stage of the war will be established.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Strengthens Military Education for Students: Ministry of Education Announces Outline</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - At a cabinet meeting held in October last year, the Japanese government decided on emergency wartime measures regarding education. In order to adapt to the current situation such as the reduction of the conscription age for students and to prepare and strengthen military education, the Ministry of Education has been conducting research in close contact with the army and navy authorities since the end of last year. The agreed-upon plan was decided after being explained by Minister of Education Okabe at a cabinet meeting held on the 4th. The Ministry of Education announced the "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students" at 3:00 PM. The main points are as follows: The significance of "Outline for Strengthening Military Education for Students" lies in refreshing and preparing the content of military education implemented in the past in schools and striving to thoroughly complete basic training. For universities and higher specialized schools, the aim is to improve the necessary command capabilities and train junior officers. For a specific group of students, special training such as aviation training and mechanical training is strengthened to actively train students under decisive battles in order to increase combat power. It was also decided to add military instructor time and teach armaments science and military field medicine. Armaments science includes military science such as tactics and war history. The construction, parts repair, and adjustment of guns, artillery, ammunition, chemicals, weapons, automobiles, tanks, military communication equipment, airplanes, and radio weapons. Military field medicine is designed for medical students and includes sanitation services, air defense rescue, health soldier countermeasures, and aviation medicine. Therefore, the training time will be increased by more than 50% for science and engineering schools and more than 100% for law and liberal arts schools.</p>
<p>Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Issues Statement</p>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Minister of Education decided to strengthen military education for students in the current situation, and the military authorities also have great expectations for this. Director Nasu of the Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau recently issued a statement saying: "In this decisive situation, the mission of school education is extremely important. Schools should, at the request of the nation and the needs of the times, adhere to the concept of serving as a preparatory school for the national army and implement military education. The most noteworthy thing in the measures to strengthen military education announced this time is that military education not only strengthens military training, but must also uphold the imperial rescript given to soldiers, and adopt a large amount of active military teaching materials in both spiritual education and general subjects to complement military training in order to increase the combat power of students and implement education that combines both literary and military aspects. As for the rapid achievement of epoch-making results in this measure, the personnel in charge of education are truly responsible. The school authorities must deeply realize that military education for students, but the directors, who are in charge of supervising and guiding the specially important ministers in school education under the current war situation, must also be aware of the overall situation and take the lead in supervising and encouraging students in order to complete the decisive battle.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Japanese Army's Suppression of Communists in Shijiazhuang</h3>
<p>Shijiazhuang, 4th (Central News Agency) - A certain unit of the Japanese army braved the severe cold and launched a campaign to sweep away the communist bandits in Hebei Province. The Ono unit launched a sudden attack on the southern 15-kilometer area of Weixian County on January 17th and consolidated the communist bandits of the Fourth Sub-district of Southern Hebei, with the following results: The Japanese army recovered 4 enemy captives and seized 15 rifles, 55 rounds of ammunition, 5 pistols, and 29 hand grenades.

<h3>Strict Review by Physicians: Director Lu of the Department of Health Speaks</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Physician Law designated by the Department of Health was officially promulgated and implemented by the National Government on February 1st. This reporter believes that obtaining physician qualifications and whether they are qualified are of utmost importance to the nation's life and health. It is also extremely important whether foreign physicians residing in China enjoy the same treatment as domestic physicians. Therefore, in order to understand this situation, I specifically interviewed Lu Runzhi, Director of the Department. He informed me in detail that the Department of Health formulated the Physician Law as a standard for reviewing the qualifications of physicians, referring to the previous Provisional Regulations for Physicians and the Regulations for Western Medicine, as well as the international situation, and drafted the Physician Law. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan this year and sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval, and then submitted to the National Government, which officially promulgated and implemented it in February. From now on, anyone applying for a physician's certificate can be reviewed for qualification according to the law, and certificates will be issued regularly as a basis for practicing medicine. The Department has already prepared many copies of this certificate, waiting for the Physician Law to be announced and implemented before issuing them. The Physician Law set this time not only provides a basis for domestic physicians, but also allows physicians from countries that have medical reciprocity agreements with our country to receive the same treatment as domestic physicians. However, the responsibilities they bear are extremely important, as stated in Article 11: "Physicians may use medicines and perform surgery to prevent or treat diseases and injuries, or, when necessary, delineate areas and restrict the freedom of others to reside and enter." Article 15: "Physicians have the obligation to accept the entrustment of competent authorities to assist in handling public health, rescue, and health insurance and other undertakings." These responsibilities are of utmost importance, so the qualification of physicians must be reviewed very carefully. Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years, who use opium or drugs, who have been declared incompetent, or who are mentally incapacitated with definite evidence, who have physical disabilities that prevent them from practicing medicine, or who have been declared bankrupt and have not yet been reinstated, cannot serve as physicians. From now on, the review of physicians will be based on the Physician Law and strictly enforced to achieve the goal of protecting the people's health.</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Launches Full-Scale Offensive on Eastern Front, German Troops Retreat from Roweno and Nord</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The German Head of State's Headquarters announced on the 3rd: The Soviet army repeatedly attacked in the Pobeite swamp area. After the German army launched a fierce defensive battle northwest of the area, it retreated from Roweno and Loutke.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet army is launching a full-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, and the German army is finding it difficult to defend. Due to the mild winter climate, the front line is muddy and the motorized units cannot move. The Soviet army continues to reinforce, but it has been severely attacked by the German army and has not succeeded. As the Soviet army's pressure increases, the German army moves to new positions in the rear, and then counterattacks to repel the Soviet army and regain lost territory. For example, in the northern part of the Eastern Front, the Soviet army west of Novgorod entered the German army's position and has been repelled. The situation is most intense in the northern part of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army has sent reinforcements to fight between Lake Ilmen and Finland. The Soviet army has launched many attacks east of Narva, but has been repelled. The Soviet army west of Novgorod has made no progress. The Soviet army is approaching the Estonian border, and Estonia has ordered a general mobilization. The German army's defensive area will be assisted by the Estonian army. The Soviet army has reinforced its offensive in the central part of the Eastern Front. After Pobeite and Berezina asked Nord and Loutke, it has moved to a new position. South of Cherkasy, the Soviet army attempted to break through the German army's position. The German tank unit sought to arrest the Soviet army and a fierce battle occurred. The Soviet army south of Dnepropetrovsk attempted to expand the gap, but was repelled by the German motorized unit. The German army counterattacked south of the Nikopol bridgehead and filled the gap. Although the Soviet army has a large number of troops, it was still repelled by the German army.</p>
<h3>Rome Suffers Bombardment, Vatican Still Remains, Pope's Summer Residence Bombed Again</h3>

<p>Rome, 4th (German News Agency) - Pope Pius XII's Castel Gandolfo summer palace was bombed again by enemy aircraft on the 2nd. Enemy aircraft dropped a total of twelve bombs on the palace. One person was killed in the Pope's villa, and two guards and two children were injured.</p>
<h3>Intense Fighting at Anzio Resembles Hell on Earth, Cannon Fire Shakes Mountains</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency, German war correspondent Jasper said: The war on Anzio beach is fierce, like a volcano. At night, the sky is as red as blood, and the landing site of the anti-Axis forces is filled with thick smoke and intense fire. The highway from Anzio to Rome is bombarded by anti-Axis artillery fire day and night, and its naval artillery fire also assists the landing troops in combat.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - Hai Tong News Agency's special correspondent on the Italian front, Wei Buxuan, declared: Fierce fighting on the Anzio front is now taking place southwest of Cisterna. In the past three days, although the U.S. military has repeatedly attacked the German positions there, it has not been able to reach Via Appia. The U.S. military wants to open up this famous highway, built 2,250 years ago, at any cost, but Via Appia is still in the hands of the German army. The U.S. vanguard rushed near the highway and discovered the strength of the German defenses, and must feel that it is extremely difficult to make progress.</p>
<p>German Paratroopers Are Especially Brave and Good at Fighting</p>
<p>German Army Infantry Paratrooper Captain Young said, "When the U.S. military advanced towards our position, waiting for them to gather only ten meters away, I ordered a counterattack. This battle almost completely wiped out the invading enemy." The battles on the Cisterna front are currently jointly responsible by German Colonels Schilz and Hanmann, both of whom are brave and good at fighting and have received the Knight's Iron Cross. The U.S. military's offensive on the 4th was repeatedly wounded, and had to reorganize and replenish its troops within a few hours. It is believed that the U.S. military will launch another offensive in a few days, because the U.S. military is eager to seize Via Appia.</p>
<p>British and American Forces Prepare for New Landing Operations</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (German News Agency) - U.S. forces on the Italian front on Wednesday concentrated most of their efforts on resisting the German counteroffensive west of Cisterna, while also increasing their attempts to break through at Cassino, somewhere north of the mouth of the Tiber River, or in the Civitavecchia area.</p>
<p>Street Fighting Occurs in Cassino</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to telegrams from Rome, the new battlefield of Anzio is about 30 kilometers from Rome, and the sound of cannon fire can now be heard in Rome. The focus of the battle is still at Cisterna on the Appian Way.

It is rumored that the U.S. Fifth Army in the Cassino war zone has broken through the Cassino front, which is several kilometers long, and then attempted to encircle the city of Cassino from the north. On the 2nd, it had approached the outskirts of the city to a point 500 meters away. The German army is still fighting stubbornly in the city of Cassino.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to news obtained here, the German army in Italy is stubbornly defending Cassino and engaged the anti-Axis forces that had entered the city on the 4th, and a fierce street battle is now underway.</p>
<h3>Montgomery Predicts End of European War This Year</h3>

This war has been going on for quite a long time, and I am gradually becoming impatient and think it should end soon.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Debate War Situation</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to news from London: British Foreign Secretary Eden announced in the House of Commons yesterday: The long-awaited war situation debate will be proposed as soon as Prime Minister Churchill considers the time is right from an international perspective.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - News from London: King George VI of England received General Ramsay, the new Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, at Buckingham Palace.</p>
<h3>Turkish President's Tour</h3>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Hai Tong News Agency: Turkish President Ismet left the Turkish capital to tour the provinces and will first go to Kutahya. The time of his return has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation on the German-Soviet Front</h3>
<p>The Red Army, which broke through the German encirclement of Leningrad and recovered Puxkin, 30 kilometers south of the city, on January 24, advanced southwest, approaching Krasnogvardeisk, a key railway hub connecting Estonia and Lithuania, and the Latvian border, and advancing towards Pskov. On the Lake Ilmen front, the Red Army under General Meleichkov, echoing the offensive of the Red Army under General Kovelos in the Leningrad area, also began an offensive. Therefore, the Swedish army withdrew from Novgorod. In this way, the Swedish army achieved the first step of its battle against the counterattack by the German army under Generals Lintaieman and Quiserler. The subsequent strategic goal seems to be Riga.</p>
<p>Southern Front Temporarily Deadlocked</p>
<p>According to observations from neutral countries, the Red Army's offensive intentions in the northern theater are: First, to lift the siege of Leningrad; second, to shift the gaze of the German army to the north. As a result of the recent revitalization of the northern war, the center of the eastern war has shifted from the southern theater to the north. In the southern theater, due to Marshal Meng Schtan's counterattack, it is temporarily deadlocked.</p>
<p>However, expert observation indicates that the main stage of the Eastern Front is still the Southern Front and will never be deadlocked. Because the Red Army's offensive in this area was blocked, it had no choice but to take a defensive position in the Vinnytsia area. The Red Army's intention was to cut off the German army's connection in Ukraine and Poland in this area.</p>
<p>According to a Moscow telegram exchanged through communications: Meng Schtan's army launched a major offensive against the left wing of the Vazhkin army in the Vinnytsia area with tank and infantry divisions. The Vazhkin army responded to the German army's attack with several artillery divisions. Fierce fighting is currently underway.</p>
<p>In this way, Meng Schtan's army once again showed the miracle it had previously displayed in the Don River bend, securing the German defense line from the foremost Nikopol bridgehead, through Kryvyi Rih, the Dnepr River bend, to the southern front of the Pripet Marshes. However, Meng Schtan's army's task is far from over, because the moment Meng Schtan's army's resistance ends, the Vazhkin army's attack is expected to begin. To keep the German army on the defensive, constant effort must be made, so now the Red Army is trying to attack the Pripet Marshes to the west. The German army is blocking its attack from strong positions. Therefore, Meng Schtan's army can resist for a while in the Vinnytsia area, which is an important point currently secured by the German army on the southern front.</p>
<p>German Resistance Increases</p>
<p>Neutral newspapers say, "The stalemate on the entire Eastern Front is becoming more and more obvious, and German resistance is increasing." But "Is the current stalemate the final stage caused by the Red Army's winter offensive? Or is it a temporary rest period before attacking Meng Schtan's army and Poland?" This point has become a problem.</p>
<p>The following opinions expressed recently by well-informed German military sources are noteworthy:</p>
<p>"The Red Army will continue to attack, and the retreat of the German army is expected. But when the Red Army begins a decisive offensive against the German army's inner defense line, it cannot be said that the collapse of the entire German front." (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun in western Japan on January 20).</p>

<h3>Coal Balls, Firewood, and Soap Rationing Begins in Nanshi, Purchase Certificates to be Widely Distributed Starting on the 7th</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The supply of fire, glory, and soap coal balls has lost its balance. Rationing has been carried out in the two districts for some time, but it has not yet been implemented in the entire Nanshi district, causing the residents of the district to rely on the black market, which only increases the burden on the lives of the residents. The city baojia committee members have been in contact with the city's economic sector and other relevant parties to suppress the black market and reduce the burden on the lives of the residents. It has also been decided to implement a rationing system. All purchase certificates will be widely distributed starting on the 7th.</p>
<p>City Baojia Association Announces Rationing</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of rationing matches, soap, and coal balls in the entire Nanshi district, the City Baojia Committee has negotiated with the City Economic Bureau and relevant parties and decided to adopt a rationing system. The association yesterday formally issued a public notice to inform the public, which stated: "It has been found that the rationing of matches, soap, and coal balls to the households in the seventh district of this city has been completed by the association's personnel together with the relevant agencies. It is now scheduled to distribute the first batch of match, soap, and coal ball purchase certificates and the second batch of match and soap purchase certificates at the Lianbao offices in the seventh district of the city from the 7th to the 10th of this month. All household heads are requested to bring their house number and the receipts for the Baojia expenses for January and February of this year, as well as the household head's name stamp, to the Lianbao office to which they belong to receive them every day from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm. Purchase from the merchants indicated on the purchase certificate from now on. In addition to separate orders, this notice is hereby issued to inform the public, and is signed by Chairman Lu Ying.</p>
<p>Soap by Household, Firewood and Coal by Person</p>
<p>The rationing of daily necessities in Nanshi Province is based on a rationing system. Due to the limited quantity of soap, the City Economic Bureau has not been able to ration it by person. It is temporarily set to give each household three bars of soap. Other matches and coal balls are given by person. The selling price is based on the limited price. The price of each Mingxing soap is ten yuan and five jiao, the price of each Central soap is nineteen yuan, the price of each Yuhua soap is ten yuan, the price of each Yuanyuan soap is sixteen yuan, and the price of each Taishan and Guanghua soap is thirteen yuan and five jiao. The above selling prices must be added with donation fees. The price of matches, regardless of the brand, is one yuan per small box. Coal balls are seven jin per person, and five jiao and six fen per jin, and no additional donation fees will be deducted.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Unified Allocation of Coal Jin and Establishing New Control Organization, Restructuring of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company</h3>
<p>The Fu Bureau has been discussing concrete methods for the supply of heat fuel in this city, and so far, the bulk of coal jin has been dredged. In the past month, the arrival of white coal jin has increased significantly. In order to strengthen the unified allocation of coal jin, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, which specializes in the allocation of Chinese coal jin, will be reorganized and a new coal jin control organization will be established. The full name is "Da Zhong Lian Coal Control Association." The Da Zhong Lian Coal Company was established in February of last year and has been around for a year. The allocation organization is organized by sixteen Chinese coal jin vendors. Now, in order to strengthen the unified control and allocation of coal jin, the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company will be reorganized. It has been decided to dissolve it at the general meeting on the 2nd, and it will be submitted to the board of directors of the Coal Federation for approval on the 3rd. Therefore, it has been decided to organize a new control organization in the near future. As for the newly established control organization, it is designated as the "Da Zhong Lian Coal Control Association." In addition to the sixteen sellers of the Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, eleven new members will be added. Once this organization is established, there will be a more satisfactory development in the allocation of coal jin.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit the Resale of Allocated Coal Jin</p>
<p>It was learned yesterday that all coal jin transported to Shanghai by the authorities must not be transported to other ports for high-priced medical treatment. All residents or merchants who know of such circumstances should immediately submit a letter to the competent department of the First District Office to report them. It should be earnestly dealt with according to the law. As for the coal balls allocated by person, the second phase has already arrived, and the results are still good. However, it is hoped that the distributors will be prevented from stealing and reducing the quantity to protect the rights and interests of the citizens. The mechanically-made coal ball factories that are responsible for manufacturing household coal balls are fully allocated the raw materials (coal seams) required for each period by the competent authorities. All household coal balls required for the next period are generally manufactured in advance. It was learned yesterday that the authorities strictly prohibit the sale of coal balls made by the manufacturers.</p>
<h3>Police Officers Stationed at Major Theaters</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The First District Police Bureau of this city has stepped up its police defense work in order to effectively maintain local peace and order. In order to maintain order and prevent accidents, it has been stipulated that special investigators will be stationed in major theaters starting this month, two in each theater, stationed inside and outside. These special police officers wear armbands with self-bottomed red characters and are responsible for paying attention to suspicious spies and villains. They also have the power to search the audience when necessary, and female investigators may be dispatched to search female customers in the future. Special police officers must submit work reports every month for assessment.</p>
<h3>Japan and Army Overseas Reporting Conference Jointly Held Yesterday, Lieutenant Sakamoto Talks About Reporting Mission</h3>
<p>China Lost Society News - The Japan-Army Overseas Three Authorities-sponsored Army Overseas Joint Meeting was held at the Huisun Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road, yesterday (4th) at 3 pm, as usual. Those present included Lieutenant Sakamoto from the Army Reporting Department, Special Assistant Akaboshi, Captain Kanda from the Fleet Reporting Department, Special Assistant Wang Bingnan, Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, Vice Consul Fukumon, etc., as well as no less than dozens of reporters from various Chinese newspapers in this city. Director Hirota of the Information Department recently transferred to a new position, but he was still happy to participate in the meeting yesterday before returning to his country to take up his new position, which was especially rare. Lieutenant Sakamoto attended on behalf of Reporting Minister Izubuchi, so the mood of yesterday's meeting was unusually enthusiastic. At the meeting, Lieutenant Sakamoto first explained his mission, saying that he was very happy to meet everyone for the first time after being introduced by Mr. Akaboshi. It is very important in publicity and reporting during the current fierce battle period of the Greater East Asia War. My mission in charge of this reporting work is even more difficult. Fortunately, the headquarters has repeatedly received special cooperation from the press, and the assistance of the Fleet Reporting Department, the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and especially Mr. Akaboshi of the headquarters has contributed the most. I am happy to fulfill my mission and hope that everyone will cooperate and help even more in the future. Captain Hoda of the Fleet Reporting Department then spoke, and Director Hirota of the Embassy answered the questions raised by the reporter group in detail, which lasted for two hours before ending.</p>
<h3>Price of 10th Period Household Sugar to be Adjusted, Allotment and Sale to be Announced and Distributed Upon Approval</h3>
<p>After the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office was approved by the authorities to implement the apportionment of sugar by population, as well as special allocations to various industries, all sectors hoped that the 10th period of household sugar would be apportioned as soon as possible in order to maintain the people's food supply. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency recently learned from relevant sources that the household sugar for this period has been prepared, but the price and quantity are being reviewed by the relevant authorities. It is determined that the price will be adjusted, and the quantity will be 1.4 to 1.6 taels per person. As soon as the authorities approve it, a notice will be issued for distribution and designated South Goods stores will be issued purchase stamps. As for the special allocation price for various industries, which was originally 14 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen, it has now been decided to increase it as well. It will be issued according to the original amount.</p>
<h3>Ancient Porcelain Exhibition Opens Today</h3>
<p>Among Chinese porcelain, the oldest recorded is the green porcelain of Ou and Yue in the Jin Dynasty, which is the source of the secret color porcelain of the Qian family in the Five Dynasties. The electrical appliances of the Tang Dynasty (in the fourth year of Wude, Jiangxi Xinping Huo Zhongchu, etc. were ordered to make appliances for the emperor, which were called Huo appliances at the time) were white in color and thin in texture, and their glaze was as clear as jade. Later, the famous Jingdezhen porcelain originated from this. Since Zhu, the manufacture of appliances has been comprehensive. During the Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong reigns of the Qing Dynasty, the material resources were abundant, and the products were especially outstanding. Porcelain has reached its culmination at this point. However, as time goes by and dynasties change, losses and disturbances occur frequently. Many of the productions of past dynasties have been lost. Those that have survived the tribulations are rare and precious. The great collectors of porcelain in Shanghai, feeling this, took the spirit of public art and generously displayed their collections, gathering together ancient porcelain from the Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, to provide us with research and appreciation, which is truly a grand event in the art world. Antiquarians, please do not miss it. (The exhibition will be held from the 5th to the 12th at the China Salt Garden, Meiqi Building, No. 996 Jing'an Temple Road).</p>
<h3>Notice Regarding Collection of Subsidies</h3>
<p>Old students of senior primary school can collect approved subsidy checks starting from the 7th of this month, while new students of senior primary school can collect them starting from the 8th. All those whose approval has been announced in this newspaper should come to the office promptly from that date, accompanied by themselves or their parents, bringing their personal seals (i.e., the original seal used on the application form) to collect the checks. All students whose names have been published by this office and who need to transfer schools should immediately send a letter to the scholarship office of this office, stating the reasons for the transfer and requesting a change. Otherwise, once the check has been issued, no further changes will be allowed. After receiving the check, the school should be responsible for collecting the money from the bank within two weeks; otherwise, it will be void. Applicants who are unable to attend school due to other reasons should promptly return the check they have received.</p>
<p>Economic Discourse</p>
<p>Commentary on Genuine Stock Prices</p>
<p>Using "Genuine Stock Prices" as the topic implies that there must be a kind of "false stock price." Since the Lunar New Year, the Chinese stock market has often been in a state of stagnation. How to evolve the stagnant state of the stock market and make it always prosperous essentially relies on the intrinsic value of the stocks themselves. Things like tight or loose monetary policy, favorable or unfavorable rumors, although sufficient to influence the market price of stocks, are all temporary and superficial.</p>
<p>What is the pseudo-value of a stock? Before giving the answer, we must first talk about the standards that most people generally consider to be the value of a stock. The standards they recognize are:</p>
<p>Stock liquidity,</p>
<p>Company capital increase,</p>
<p>Estimated appreciation of assets.</p>
<p>Because of this,</p>
<p>Large denominations are transformed into small denominations,</p>
<p>You come to increase capital, and I also come to increase capital,</p>
<p>Everyone estimates the value of assets, and they cannot help but exaggerate.</p>
<p>Indeed, the expansion of stock liquidity is sufficient to resemble a bank absorbing more deposits, the company's capital increase is sufficient to increase the number of shares, and even the shareholder's dividend income and the estimated value of assets are sufficient to be sensational. However, has the actual value of the stock increased as a result? That is probably questionable. Otherwise, why would the market price of a company's stock with no business plan or performance exceed the face value by several times?</p>
<p>Genuine stock prices cannot arise from "luck" or "hype;" they can only arise from normal profits in operations, that is, profits obtained from business organization, manufacturing technology, and production performance. Stock prices generated from this are real and permanent.</p>
<p>Various Associations Please Strictly Prohibit</p>
<p>Non-Industry People from Hoarding Goods</p>
<p>If Discovered, Please Notify the Association</p>
<p>Commodity prices have continued to rise since the Spring Festival. According to reporters' inquiries with various industry associations, there are approximately two main reasons for the upward trend: one is that people in the industry do not follow the regulations for buying and selling, and residents are deeply afraid that commodity prices will rise sharply again, so those with money compete to purchase, and general stores take advantage of the shortage of goods to raise the prices of their inventories; the other is the illegal hoarding by people outside the industry, so that legitimate merchants are unable to purchase large quantities of goods for retail sales, people are uneasy, and the market price also presents a situation of sudden rise and fall. It is now known that various trade associations, in view of the fact that people outside the industry use their generous funds in an attempt to hoard goods, which is not in line with the purpose of suppressing and stabilizing commodity prices, mostly rely on brokers in the industry. Massively absorbing goods in this way is of great importance to the stability of the commercial market. If it is not suppressed as soon as possible, how can the entire industry and commerce remain stable for a long time? After separate meetings, several rounds of discussions on good strategies have been held, and it has now been decided that, in addition to authorizing the various price evaluation committees to be responsible for supervising member stores to strictly implement the regulations, the associations will also formally appeal to the competent authorities to use political power to prohibit non-legitimate merchants and people outside the industry from purchasing and hoarding any goods. If hoarding is discovered, the industry association should be notified first to prove whether the person is a member or non-member. In any case, regardless of what kind of goods are being operated and what the nature of the business is, they must join the relevant industry association in accordance with the regulations, pay membership fees, and enjoy all rights to allocated materials. If disputes arise between members due to transactions, all companies and businesses can apply to the industry association for mediation.</p>
<p>Non-Association Members Are Not Allowed to Engage in the Egg Business</p>
<p>Authorities Plan to Strengthen Control Mechanisms</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the black market for eggs in this city has continued to rise. It is heard that in order to effectively stabilize prices, the authorities will thoroughly strengthen the egg allocation mechanism. At the same time, they are also seeking to unblock the source. It seems that the crux of the current problem lies in the fact that some of the eggs transported to Shanghai are being manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, resulting in an imbalance in market supply and demand, and prices are easily rising. This is due to the fact that the allocation mechanism is not strict enough. Therefore, the authorities may establish a new control and allocation mechanism when necessary.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Industry Association, in order to prevent non-association members from hoarding eggs, has specifically stipulated that non-association members are absolutely not allowed to engage in the egg business. There are also strict restrictions on the qualifications of members. Newly established egg businesses must have a shop owner or manager who has been engaged in the egg business for more than five years, have store equipment, directly employ more than five people, have been approved by the Municipal Food and Poverty Relief Bureau and obtained a certificate, and must be introduced by two members before they can join the association. Non-members who privately operate businesses will be punished once discovered.</p>
<p>The egg industry in this city has achieved close cooperation with Japan. On the Japanese side, there is also an organization called the Egg Industry Cooperative Federation. Its members include units such as Yangtze Egg Industry, Cold Storage Co., Ltd., China-Japan Egg Industry Co., Ltd., and Limited Company Internal and External Egg Company. Eggs transported to Shanghai from various ports are reasonably distributed in both directions. Approximately 60% of chicken eggs are allocated to the Japanese side, and 40% to the Chinese side. The allocation ratio of duck eggs is similar.</p>

<p>Major Buyers Reluctant, Retail Investors Eager to Sell: Chinese Stocks Decline Further</p>
<p>Transactions Still Concentrated in a Few New Listings</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chinese stocks once again reported a decline. The activity of buyers who short sell was even weaker. Conversely, there was a strong eagerness to realize profits and sell. In sparse trading volume, most industry stocks saw small losses. However, there were also some that were backed by behind-the-scenes support and rose against the trend. Among the chemical industry stocks, the new stock *鷥* was firm. Calcium Milk Life, China Timber, and China Milk Powder all saw gains. Greater China Match was flat and weak. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-Western was firm, while the rest were weak. In the department store industry, National Goods and Xinhua each rose by one yuan, while Wing On and others were weak. In the textile industry, Round and Round rose by one and a half yuan, which was the largest increase. China Textile, Sino-Foreign, and Wing On and other yarn factories all saw declines. Utility stocks were flat with sparse trading. In the cultural sector, Jinjian was the only firm stock, once reaching the 20 yuan mark. China Film and Bookstore stocks were weak. In the real estate sector, Lianhua was the only one with small losses. Taishan had the most active trading. Guohua rose by 1.75 yuan, which was the largest increase. Ren Tianfeng also made progress. Yongxing and others were flat. Other stocks such as Chengda and Global Enterprise, Tianxiang Industrial, and Datong Business were all firm. Liali Jiu'an and other property stocks mostly saw small losses. The closing prices at noon today are listed below.</p>

<p>Navy by Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>The New Year of Showa 11 (1936) has arrived, and Zhenren is already eighteen years old.</p>
<p>The end-of-year academic exams, like eating too much glutinous rice cake, still lingered in his stomach, but he embraced the doctrine of the Great Saigo and awaited fate. Although that was what he said, such delusions could never be dispelled, because although the four days of exams had passed safely, elimination was still inevitable, and there were many such precedents.</p>
<p>On the second day of the New Year, he visited Ryuofu's home and was surprised to see Ryuofu's attitude, which was unexpectedly very quiet.</p>
<p>"I've already seen an ophthalmologist..." Ryuofu said calmly. It is said that his motivation for going to the ophthalmologist was to discover a way to become a naval officer even with poor eyesight. The ophthalmologist indeed diagnosed him with nearsightedness and mild astigmatism. But Ryuofu had expected this, so he wasn't surprised. "There's no reason why you can't be a naval officer with glasses... I've already decided to study military science and think about entering the Business School. Zhenren--no matter what, I'm determined to be a military man!"</p>
<p>His face was filled with passion and pleading.</p>
<p>Ryuofu loved the sea--the navy--so much that Zhenren hadn't imagined. He was ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>Soon, the New Year had passed, and it was National Foundation Day again. After Zhenren completed the school ceremony, he returned home. As he was thinking of going to Ryuofu's house and stepping out the door, a postman came with a telegram.</p>
<p>"Mr. Tani Zhenren, a telegram!"</p>
<p>Receiving a telegram addressed to himself was a first in his life. He tremblingly opened the telegram paper and saw:</p>
<p>--Accepted into the Naval Academy - Chairman</p>
<p>It was a telegram from the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy. In an instant, Zhenren's mind felt infinitely empty, and his eyes couldn't see anything.</p>
<p>"Mother..." He managed to show the telegram to his mother.</p>
<p>"Please tell Four-Kichi when he comes back!" Saying this, Zhenren ran outside. He suddenly thought that it would be too embarrassing to show it to Ryuofu, who had already failed the exam. It would be better to convey the good news to the teachers at the school who were still at the National Foundation Day celebration.</p>
<p>In the teachers' room, packages of red bean rice were lined up in front of them as they sat.</p>
<p>Zhenren first handed the telegram to the headmaster. At this time, Kumazawa, who had received the same telegram, also ran over. Mr. Ogata stood up and embraced both of them.</p>
<p>From the military class's fourth-year students, two naval academy entrants and one army entrant had emerged. The brave Komori belonged to the latter. Furthermore, combined with the number of people in the second year, there were 21 army entrants and 8 naval entrants, a total of 29 entrants. This was truly a shining national achievement. Headmaster Kawata and Mr. Ogata's noses seemed to have grown two or three inches longer.</p>
<p>Fourth Student (1)</p>
<p>"Let's hold a celebratory party for your acceptance, how about it?" Around ten o'clock in the morning, Ryuofu came to find Zhenren. Because he had already changed his mind and wanted to enter business school, his worries had been relieved, and he sincerely wanted to congratulate his good friend on his honor.</p>
<p>"No need, there's no need for that kind of thing!" Zhenren said, shaking his head with a smile.</p>
<p>"In any case, let's go see the Daiei Planetarium!" Ryuofu insisted on taking Zhenren outside.</p>
<p>The two walked onto the streets, which in February already had the scent of spring. The plum blossoms were all in full bloom, and the cherry blossoms seen over the walls also seemed ready to open.</p>
<p>"My home's receiving machine couldn't be heard early in the morning, and I didn't do morning exercises."</p>
<p>"Maybe the machine is broken." Zhenren replied to Ryuofu's question.</p>

<p>Nantong Homespun Yarn Overview in the National Forum Wang Zhongwei</p>
<p>I continued to read Mr. Zhu and Mr. Yang's letters published in Tai Lan regarding the problem of local yarn. I have been in this industry for a year, and I would like to present an overview of the local yarn industry in Nantong, the leading county in northern Jiangsu, to those who are interested.</p>
<p>The entire Nantong market has always been dominated by cotton yarn and cloth, especially local cloth (wide cloth, big cloth, small cloth), which is famous throughout the country. Big cloth, advocated by Mr. Zhang Jian, was once sold to the three northeastern provinces and the Kanto region, and the annual turnover was very large. It was suspended after the September 18th Incident. Later, a wide cloth with improved products was produced, and the colors and patterns were not inferior to those produced by factories. However, they were all hand-woven by villagers, so the sales of cotton yarn were very large. In the past, the No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 factories of Dasheng and various factories in Shanghai supplied the yarn, so there was no need to worry about shortages, and the cotton produced was abundant, with excellent color and quality. In recent years, due to our country's economic controls and transportation obstacles, the supply and demand of guest yarn have been unequal, and prices are high and goods are scarce. Therefore, "local yarn" has become one of the emerging industries. Middle and lower-class families, old women, and children all spin yarn as a common thing. With the promotion of local yarn operators, the products have become better and better. The best ones can be compared to 20s and 16s yarns, and they are actually better. The price is about 80 to 90 yuan per Shanghai catty, which is less than half of that of guest yarn (20s Double Horse is 2,400 yuan, each small package is 9.5 catties, which is equivalent to more than 250 yuan per Shanghai catty). The price of good cotton is only 345 yuan (the Cotton Control Association's set price is about 23 yuan). After spinning it into yarn, there is still more than double the profit. Therefore, there are more and more spinners, and the output is increasing day by day. The daily production and sales in the entire Nantong city are between 5,000 and 10,000 catties. The buying and selling time is in the early morning and at noon. Villagers use it to weave cloth, which is sold to northern Jiangsu and the Huaihai provinces. The business is no less than the Kanto trade of that year.</p>
<p>It is understood that the number and quality of local yarn products in Jiangnan are not as good as those in Jiangbei, but if they can be researched and improved, it will not be difficult to be on par. It is rare for cotton-producing areas in our country to be able to spin, dye, and weave on their own. If people with good intentions promote and guide this, it will not only benefit the rural economy, but also solve the problem of clothing and cloth today and indirectly eliminate the panic of yarn and cloth today. In this context of increasing production, there is indeed hope! May those who have the power and intention take action quickly!</p>
<p>Community Service Beware of Swindlers at the Door</p>
<p>On the 22nd of last month, a man around 30 years old, wearing a suit and leather shoes, calling himself Sun, with the name Bonian, came to our office to find me, saying that he had recently come to Shanghai from Hankou and worked as a doctor at the Hanyang County Hospital, and was a colleague of my daughter. He recounted the bombing and rescue of my daughter on the Yangtze River journey and her return to the hospital in detail, which was very consistent. He also said that his trip to Shanghai was to transport an X-ray machine back to Hankou and to purchase all kinds of medicines, and that a sum of tens of thousands of yuan would be sent to Shanghai from Hankou in a few days, and he planned to remit it to me for transfer. Since I thought he was a colleague of my daughter, I did my best to entertain him. He also said that several pieces of luggage were at the transportation company, and after picking them up, he also intended to store them at our place. He said he was short of money and wanted to borrow thousands of yuan. I valued our friendship very much and did not suspect him. It happened that I had received my salary the previous day, so I paid him one thousand yuan and respectfully sent him out the door. But as he was leaving, he seemed flustered, which made me suspect that he was a swindler. I immediately went after him, but he was gone. It has been many days now, and there is no news at all. This is undoubtedly a swindler. Furthermore, according to a friend, many such swindlers have been discovered in the city, and there are many victims. I hope everyone will pay attention. Furthermore, it is a question where the swindler got the information. Did he steal and open letters, which is a real question. (Xu Guanglin)</p>
