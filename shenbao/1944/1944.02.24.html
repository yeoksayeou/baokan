<h3>社評　太平洋戰局之檢討</h3>
<p>問：近來太平洋戰局，日趨嚴重，敵人之作戰動機如何？</p>
<p>答：戰略是與政略不能分割的。從目前　個國際局勢觀察，歐洲戰事，業已逼臨決戰階段，英美所謂進攻歐陸開闢　第二戰綫應該是用事實來表現的時候了。但是實際上蘇聯的動機攻勢已　結束，而美此蘇之間的衝突對立亦開始新的發展，因此英美所謂進攻歐陸的第二戰綫暫時又擱置一邊，改取政治攻勢，一方面拉攏中立國家以　獨立德國，另方面按兵不動，不爲蘇聯從火爭票。敵人英美對歐洲的方針有了這樣的變動之後，就轉而對太平洋方面妄圖一逞，展開所謂「巾央突破」攻勢。發展問：太平洋攻勢　圖與戰局發展前途如何？</p>
<p>答：敵人對太平洋攻勢的野心，當然不自今日始。經過一年以上敗退時期的生產補充之後，早自去年開始作所謂反攻的企圖，並且在阿圖島，在所羅門羣島，都的鬥志所擊敗了。特別是玻根維爾島海空會偷偷地　試過，可是完全被日軍的應用激戰，使敵人受珍珠港以來最慘重的打擊。然而敵人的野心未　，惱羞成怒，利用歐洲的局勢，開始這次新的攻勢。目前戰爭正在進行中，全面的批判尙非共時，但觀其一攻馬紹爾羣島，再擊加羅林羣島中之特魯克島，至少可以窺見敵人抱有較大的戰略野心，其前途發展，對於東亞大局關係非常大？的眞相，有可得而言者否？</p>
<p>答：敵人此次功勢，非同去年之」跳島作戰」，而有其較大規模的準備。在戰略要求上，大概企圖誘惑日本海軍主力出而膺戰，在實行中，一面仍舊進行海空游擊戰以圖破壞海上運輸交通綫。更可注意的是駐渝印空軍的利用和對緬甸方而的反攻行動。同時其主攻戰力則漸向馬紹爾羣島乃至加羅琳羣島妄圖「中央突破」。幸　日本當局對詞早有　見，所以首有「先發制敵」的緬印作戰，堅持亞洲大陸方面的主動優勢，然後全力應付太平洋方面的頑敵。最主要的戰績，是日前拉巴爾及馬紹爾海空戰及特魯克方面的海戰，給偷襲之敵以嚴重的打擊，始終保持日軍在大東亞的主動優勢。</p>
<p>問：那麼，東亞大局可以說是金湯　固了，不過如何進一步勝利完遂大東亞戰爭呢答？柬亞的戰局，雖然仍由日軍確保優勝，但為迅速爭取最後勝利，日本當局已經採取非常决策，就是日前日本內閣的調整强化。這次日不內閣調整，最主要的目標，在於「政戰兩略一致」，上下一心，以「積極果敢」之精神，應付戰局，確保勝利然則，我們是參戰國家，對此決戰時局，將怎樣應付呢？</p>
<p>答：我們也必須進一步的實踐參戰義務。第一，堅定必勝信念，不為流言所動。第二，以爭取戰爭勝利為大前提，盡可能貢獻一切人力物力。第三，我們旣無軍隊參加前綫作戰，在後方尤應悉力負起參戰義務。</p>

<h3>「海戰特質　及必勝信念」日高橋大將發表演說</h3>
<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據小倉電話，日高橋三吉軍大將，二十三日假此間日本鐵鑛業公司九井工塲發表演說，說明海戰之特質及必勝之信念，大意謂：我國民中有認為南方戰局情勢與現德·蘇戰綫戰局情勢相同者，此實為不明暸海戰與陸上作戰不同之點，且以海戰與陸戰在性質上逈乎不同，蓋攷日·俄戰爭，當時兩方在狹窄之朝鮮海峽淮行，僅經二日間之海戰，其結果當為國民所共知者。蓋此次海戰，並非在爭奪此狹窄之海峽，而係在奪取制海權，海上作戰之根本特質，即在於此。今南方地域，島嶼棋布，與此狹窄海峽，其地形尤異，此有其利，亦有其弊，其利點在於此等島嶼可作航空基地，其幣點在於缺乏機動性，故於此等地域中作戰，多利用航空母艦，但航空母艦亦有其長處與短處，其長處在具有機動性，其短處在有被擊沉之虞，是故對此一者應當力謀善為活用，始克有濟。日·美兩方則正積極活用此二者以爭短長，因有一部島嶼巳為敵人奪去，而感悲觀者，實由於以視察德·蘇戰之眼光而視察海上作戰所致，但吾人尤應認清者，敵人每奪取每一島嶼，必付相當之代價，敵人或於奪取島嶼後，建立基地，但日海軍戰力並未為敵所滅，則爲國人所當認淸者。最後爭勝制海權者即為勝利者，是故吾人唯有擊退敵人海上勢力，始為攫取制海權之手段，亦即制勝之關鍵，敵若迫近我本土，而其所受損害愈大，實力喪失之甚，此即促成吾人勝利之徵兆。及至敵海上勢力完全消滅後，吾人始可將敵人擊潰，海上戰門，實具有此種重大之特質，敵人刻正焦急萬狀，不得不乘機早日推進戰爭，但此實爲吾人所望者，余之意見對戰局前途殊感樂觀也。</p>

<h3>英相邱吉爾　在下院演說</h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日中央社電　據倫數消息，邱吉爾首相星期二日在下院發表稱：目前英·美對德之空襲，應認為反軸心之主要攻勢，而於今年春季及夏季，此種轟炸將即加緊進行，反軸心之進攻計劃，亦以空襲為基本原則，而謂英·美之重要工具之飛機之活動，應受限制之思想·反軸心國决不容受。論及義大利戰况，其本態所以有令人失望之發慶者，乃因義境之不良氣候所致，故義境之作戰，將極艱苦，因義境之東·西兩岸，均不能實行大規模之兩樓戰事。論及德黑蘭·開羅及莫斯科之會議稱：倘三國之代表能每月會議一次，則三國間將無異見，個信眞理報或其他報章所載之論文，即以為英·美·蘇之關係已　冷淡者，顯係謬見。英首相又對下院保證謂，在德黑蘭及莫斯科之會議中，並無讓步，且彼本人曾與斯達林委員長討論波蘭之將來，而斯達林係决意建立强大完整及獨立之波蘭，邱吉爾對此極感滿意，而　蘇聯為免除其西　將來受到西方之攻擊之要求之觀點，亦予以完全諒解。英人不獨將與蘇於軍事上合作，以求蘇聯安全之實現，且此亦獲得美國之同意，而邱吉爾及斯達林均同意於西而及北面以德國之犧牲下，以為波蘭之補償之必要，而認大西洋黨章將不適用於德國。</p>

<h3>亞洲大陸戰場的重要性</h3>
<p>— 江南隱士</p>
<p>去年春起，美國以上院議員阿爾巴特·江特拉氏為中心的所謂孤立派一派，及軍事評論家漢遜·鮑爾溫等，轉變歐洲第一主義的作戰方針，主張應傾注全力於太平洋反攻作戰。這提案使美國政府有動於中，不顧英國的不快意，而竟提出了。</p>
<p>鮑爾溫等的論據說：</p>
<p>如以充分的時間讓日本保持並利用南方佔領地區的豐富資源，日本將强化到不能打倒的地位。</p>
<p>如不速以實質的援助給與重慶政權，重慶將有脫離反軸心共同戰錢之可能。</p>
<p>歐洲戰爭如果吿終，英蘇兩國可以停止戰爭了，然而美國則不能不繼續單獨與日本戰爭。</p>
<p>又鮑爾溫在紐約泰晤士報上發表「太平洋戰略」一文中，誇示美國最近在太平洋上的空軍，船舶及登陸作戰部隊的優勢，並稱：「歐洲的戰爭是陸上與空中的戰爭，所以不待歐洲戰爭吿終，美國海軍也能以其大部分用之於太平洋作戰。因此，對日本的大規模戰事，將在歐洲戰爭吿終前開始」。</p>
<p>美國恐　「時間」</p>
<p>美國所最恐懼的，是以「時間」紿興日本，使增强其戰力至不能打倒的地位·因此，總想多少獲得一點總反攻的效果，於是就接一運二的大舉前來。但即美國本身也疑惑究竟有無把握、尤以其同夥英國，對此舉的能否成功，抱極大的疑問，而加以反對。最近在美國的馬紹爾作戰後，英國的日本通戰略家格萊夫·軋希耶中佐的評論，及星期日出版的觀察報上所載其他評論的論文，都指摘美國此次反攻作戰的無理，而斷定「日本軍的作戰，在其防備地帶的外圍綫，將續作消耗戰，此種戰鬬，在歐洲第二戰綫中需要極大資材的今日，對於協約軍完全是不可能的。」</p>
<p>美國急於太平洋總反攻的另一個原因，是在歐洲方面的英美對硃聯之政治的對立。而在其政略戰上，幾完全被蘇聯方面取得其主動性，英美則追隨其役。在巴爾幹對策上，在對中歐，中東諸國的對策上，具體的例證，不遑枚舉。美國為謀「失之東隅，收之桑榆」之計，在歐洲所失落，欲在太平洋取得補償。美國副國務卿威爾斯在最近出版的「觀察畫報」雜誌上，論美蘇關係，中間有一段說：一歐洲因他的（蘇聯的）「優越者心理」而陷於混亂；對於亞洲，非使他們（蘇聯）有能够信賴我們的理由不可。」德之，歐洲方面英美對蘇聯對立的結果，使美國欲在太平洋上占得優勢，乃有此次的反攻。</p>
<p>英國戰略家格萊夫，軋希耶中校在前述的許論中，指摘美軍太平洋反攻作戰的失策，並從海上反攻的無效果，而結論說：「要擊敗日本，協約軍不能不在亞洲大陸接近日本的地城，保持廣大的作戰基地。一他斷然聲稱應以中國大陸為其某地。與該中佐的評論如出一轍者，乃最近美國太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米資的解明，及西南太平洋反軸心軍司令官麥克沃塞的談話。尼米資說：「太平洋方面最近美海軍攻勢的主要目標，是强化中國美空軍的基地，使成為對日最後攻勢的基地。又說：「要大規模轟炸日本，祗有便用中國大陸的基地。」特其海空軍的優勢，竟然實行太平洋突破作戰，欲一舉而直衝中國大陸。麥克沃窺說：「占領散在太平洋中日屬外圍綫諸島嶼，不能視為决定的戰果，「並强調大陸戰綫的重要性說：「協約軍要獲得勝利，非打敗日本陸軍不可。」中印緬方面美軍陸上部隊司令官史蒂威爾亦响應二氏的聲明，表下面的談話：「大陸戰綫的協約軍，將派遣地上軍及空軍赴中國大陸，從空陸開始眞正的大攻勢，以呼應尼米資提督摧毀太平洋上日軍封鎖的作戰」，並宣傳加強對重　捕重要物資。</p>
<p>最後的戰場是大陸</p>
<p>以上的聲明。都一致說對日决戰的最後戰塲是大陸，這裏有三點値得注意；</p>
<p>英國戰略家軋希耶中指校摘美國太平洋反攻作戰的失策、結論中提出大陸戰塲的重要性。美國三指揮官的聲明，步其後跟，自認太平洋反攻的徒然。</p>
<p>發出上述聲明的三指揮官本身及美國和重慶的宣傳，亦均自認美國開闢大陸戰綫的困難。那　是說：美軍要在大陸登陸，以制壓瑪利阿那羣島，關島，台灣，海南島；進　新幾尼亞，菲烏，馬來，緬甸為前提，這是很困難的。事實正是如此。可是我們說起來，不是「困難」，竟是「不可能」。美國開始太平洋反攻以來，已經十個月，然而所獲得的效果，實微不足道。美國近來曾宣傳進　馬紹爾，吉爾伯特諸羣島，或許更洋洋自得誇稱此次的進迫拉巴爾，攻擊特魯克島，但在日本深謀遠慮的戰略及必勝的自信之前，毫不感到痛　，且距他們的目的點尙甚遼遠。何况日本的戰力正在日潮强盛的今日，敵方的反攻，眞有日暮途窮之感。他們本身旣已知道其困難，也就是失掉了自信。</p>
<p>在三人的言論中，可見英美狡猾的慣技，即以別國及別國人民的犧牲來完遂戰爭的企圖。尼米資聲明中，明白地說：「中國有龐大的人的資源，要征服日本，必須動員這龐大的人的資源。」他們企圖煽動重慶政權，供給武器，驅使重　治下的中國同胞當日軍進攻的炮灰，並以中國的土地化為戰場，以中國的犧牲來完成戰爭，當然，我們不會容認敵人的這企圖，可是敵人將拼命推行這計劃，强化對置慶的物資援助，擴充駐渝空軍，此種情形，决不能輕易看過。我們又遇到了對大陸戰塲應以深切注視的時期。</p>

<h3>鄭重推蔫「機器人」　苦幹最新貢獻</h3>
<p>「機聽人」！「機器人」！聶傳了半年的劇壇鉅著，終於和觀衆相見了！</p>
<p>這是苦幹劇團新的貢獻，是全滬話劇觀衆久已矚目的作品。</p>
<p>「機器人」是一部理想劇，是全滬話劇　年後新世界的情形，作者以詩人的熱情，聖哲的悲天　人的懷抱，加上預言家的明　的智慧，直出人類思想與情感的　向，它排斥自私，排斥殘忍，而指出千古不變的一條眞理，使人類永生的是愛。</p>
<p>「機器人」的劇情是浪漫而　屬的，卻有一個嚴肅而震撼人心的主題。</p>
<p>背境是在星球上，一家機器人的製造工廠　，—那時候科學的進步，即使萬物　的人類，也可以用化學方程式配合製造起來，這工廠就是奪門製造機器人，用以代替人類作工的，他們一樣的會做工，效力好，而無須工資和吃飯。這工　　有的只是機械的生活，缺少的是人間的溫情。有一天，地球上一位小姐因為火箭失事，偶然墮落到星球中來，遂使這星球裏的空氣大大地震　起來，一方面是感情的海中發現了新大陸，一方面是因為機器人製造的逐漸進步，終於做到了有血有肉，並且有思想，有感情的，能哭能笑的地步。可是悲劇接着來了，機器人聯合起來，終於毀滅了全世界眞正的人類，祇剩着一個工程師，更大的悲劇是：機器人有一定期限耍壞，宇宙間漸漸連機器人都要滅絕，幸而最後的一對機器人，不但知這反抗，還懂得了互助，情得了愛，證明人間到底還有希望，還有春陽一樣的光明和溫暖。</p>

<p>昨日發報時間七點</p>
<p>五里霧中</p>
<p>商統會為棉業管理處聶處長辭職事之復函中，有「使人如墜五里霧中』一語，我們感覺這一句話，　可為整個的經濟上海寫照；眞的，在上海進一個經濟　裏面，那一件事不是使人如隊五里霧中？溯自實施統制經濟以來，生活必需品之物資統制，旣有種種的統制與配給機構，高縣着金碧輝煌的招牌，在那兒辦理統制與配給工作，何以黑市的猖獗，物資的匱乏，終於日甚一日？又如華商股票交易，明明是有其牽菜細則，對於投機份子是可以制裁的，何以自有華商蹬券管理機構以來，股票投機之風，非但未會絲毫泯滅，抑且變本加厲，甚至助長股票投機技術上的進步？凡此種種，那一件不是使人如　五里霧中？</p>
<p>再回到這一句話的本題上面，人民渴望棉紗實施配給，不自今日始了；最近則有滬西五十餘家布廠請求商統會配給棉紗，以資維持各廠而延職工生命；同時，又有上海特別市布號業同業向零售商會員收取運動費之傳說，正由商統會令飭尅日詳具澈查辦法；同時，又有商統會棉業管理處聶處長突然辭職之事。這幾段消息，放在一起，又那一件不是使人如墜五里霧中？總之，以棉紗而論，在「收買結束工作緊張，配給問題又屬千頭萬緒」之時，誠不宜於中途再開一次倒車，坐令千百萬人所引領以待的，終於磋跎復暛跎，這是我們惟一的願望。</p>

<p>華北交易統制總會本月初旬在外灘興亞大樓一百號成立上海辦事處，開辦以來，對於調整供給斟酌，盈虛策動不遺餘力。昨據副處長徐漢文氏談稱：該處因開辦之初百端待理，除與上海有關機關多方聯絡，以期收通力合作之功效外，對於商人方面（日華商人）儘量力求便利，尤以最近通吿舉凡由北京天津靑島濟南芝不河南各地所產疏菜菓　乾果等類之運人華中者，先向上海特別市中央市塲領取搬入證書，但為整個配給平均起見，對於法定手續及數量方面，須經該處核准，方可生效云云。</p>
<h3>英美對日作戰　意見絕不一致　日陸軍報道部發言人談</h3>
<p>中央社訊日在滬陸軍部報道部所主持之定例報道常會，于昨日下午三時，循例假南京路外灘軍懋飯店八樓舉行。陸軍部報道部方面，計到坂本中尉，赤星囑托等氏，及本市中國各報社記者，即席由該部發言人，就反軸心對日總反攻之意見紛歧，發表談話如下：</p>
<p>英美主張分歧</p>
<p>日發言人首指出美太平洋艦隊司令長官尼米茲，于二月九日所發表之談話內容，據米謂：欲擊破日作戰根據地，除在渝方大陸之外，毫無其他區域，故渠準備將陸軍航空部隊開調渝方云云。繼指述美在西南太平洋司令麥克沃塞，于二月十六日所發表之談話，據麥言：欲佔領分散在太平洋之日本所屬島嶼、根本難以决定戰果，麥並謂現在之日本，非為海洋帝國，而為毫無疑義的大睦强國，故欲擊破日本大陸强國，須擊破日本陸軍不可云云。旋指述英軍事戰術家茄霞中校，在美攻擊馬紹爾時所發表之意見，查茄霞中校向熟諳日本情形，彼謂：日軍在防綫之外作戰，現正繼續進行消耗戰，目前在歐洲第二戰綫正需大量資材，惟今在協約軍立塲之作戰，則萬不可能，而茄霞中校更說明欲擊破日本，協約軍方面，更需確保在亞洲接近日本之廣大作戰根據地，易言之事根據地，始可擊破日本云云。日發言人又言，關於以上所述，與美總統羅斯福之跳島作戰主張相異，而麥克沃塞之主張，則非跳島作戰，如不重要之島嶼盡可放棄，于次足見美國意見，顯不一致。然觀美尼米茲之主張，似以突破太平洋中央作戰，擬一舉在中國方面獲取對日作戰之根據地，雖尼與麥兩人之主張相同，而以中國大陸為作戰根據地，試問有何方法，可以擊破日本？日英國之日本通茄　中校之主張，從緬甸方面獲取大降根據地，但美國方面、則以太平洋方面為出發點，是以美英雙方之意見，彼此毫不一致。</p>
<p>報章評論紛紜</p>
<p>旋日人又指出二月十九日之華盛頓郵評論、言尼米茲上將所主張之擊敗日軍，以打破日本陸軍為前題，但欲擊破日陸軍，此點頗為渺茫，即使成為事實、渝方必趨孤立，蓋因渝方物咨缺乏，亟需援助，此外如渝印航空輸送最、雖有增加，但一旦實施作戰計劃，則將來更需大量增援。參照以上所述，目前援助物資，並不豐富，今後增加物資，更形困難，其他在緬甸欲發動大規模作戰，亦恐難實現，該報特加以抨擊，指出太平洋作戰不一致之故。據華盛頓郵報載，在東南太平洋方面，由蒙特巴頓任聯合司令官，為援助渝方，欲在緬甸發動活潑作戰，但至今事實如何、而所言與現　之究竟，　為一大疑問。日發十言人並指出十一日之渝掃蕩　所刋評論，謂蒙特巴頓部卜之英印軍，為謀奪回緬甸，採取積極攻勢，而　際則相反，蓋首先採取積　攻勢者，非蒙特巴頓之部下，乃為日本軍隊，在不久將來，雨季蒞臨，日軍更可從容應戰。而同日渝大公報所言，在印英軍，不適於戰鬥，並謂美渝軍分別在太平洋與大陸與日作戰，而英國軍隊，行動如何，該報特指出英按兵不動，自蒙特巴頓任事以來，為時頗久，其工作如何，又為一大疑問。</p>
<p>充溢不滿論調</p>
<p>日發言人嗣又舉出可靠情報傳稱，謂英國主張破壞緬甸產業，隨時聶炸，此外增加印度至渝之空中運輸，似為主耍目標，對於反攻之舉，非為當前之亟，而渝蔣亦曾表示意見，深慮日本準備打通粵漢綫，為阻碍日本打通粵漠綫之計劃，從速反攻緬甸，故綜合各方論調，足證英美與渝方，意見不能一致。日渝方更對英美充溢不滿論調，我人當淸哳觀測，無論英美從太平洋出發，或緬甸出發、以及另一方面對日發動反攻，而彼輩計劃决不一致。綜觀英美所為者，極盡誇大官傳之能事，事實上毫無進展，已可證叫英美必歸失敗，一無利益。要知日本發動作戰行動，將更使彼失敗無疑、故在緬甸之第二次戰綫上，敵軍在阿拉坎取戰，再度實現在我人眼簾。末言在緬甸作戰上。自由印度國民軍參加作戰後，所受影響非淺，英·印軍已動搖非常，至今降歸者已達千名以上，故印國民軍參戰頗為順利，在一面前進，一面歸家情緒下，意氣高昂，頗為得手，故在協力作戰下，當可顯著進步云云。</p>
<p>史蒂威爾遇險</p>
<p>日在滬陸軍部報指都發言人，為昨日報道當會席上，發表美合衆社從軍記者所記載之美駐淪十四航空部隊司令長官史蒂威爾，在視察緬甸前綫時，險遭不測，摘記當時史之醜態畢露，殊屬可笑。發言人首言該合衆社美籍記者此次與史蒂威爾上將及史之參謀視察緬甸前綫時，在印緬國境夫公溪谷之地，為日軍以七五米緾榴彈砲射擊，險吿命中，得免於難，旋畏經業林羊腸小道泥濘地帶，又為日軍射發砲彈，當在潮濕地帶爆發時，有一人因受震頗重，當塲昏暈，但至第二砲彈經史身旁擦過時，史大驚撲地高呼，山頂崩倒，其時情形之狼狽，不堪霄狀。我人旣可綜觀上述日軍之順利進展態度，更從容異常反觀反軸心之妄大宣傳，及狼狽失利之情形，已不言可喻。</p>
<h3>囤積居奇　盼市民檢舉</h3>
<p>邇來物價高漲影響民生非淺，其原因初非為實需供求關係或成本高漲之必然趨勢，而多數屬於操　囤積。茲悉當局為抑平物價計，除治本方面如增加生產疏通來源，洽標方面切實厲行國府頒佈之　時物價管理暫行條例及其實施辦法外，並積極厲行各種適當處置，深盼市民時加檢舉，分別　引囤積治罪條例及戰時特別刑法予以嚴懲云。</p>

<h3>國民論壇　現階段的四大民生問題</h3>
<p>— 陳仁濕</p>
<p>衣的問題</p>
<p>衣以蔽體，亦以禦寒。年來因戰事的關係，影響所及，致原棉的生產量減少，現有棉布的配給從速實施，僅可維持目前一時，若不努力從增加產量人手，還是沒用的，因為製成的總有用完的一天：所以除了實施配給外尙須：</p>
<p>甲：獎勵植棉：　政府應當以優良的種籽，　最低廉之價格，售給與農民，並指　其合於學化的種植法和妨害法　政府收買原棉時，應當　及農民的本身利益和其合法利　及成本而酌定一公尤之收買價格，以避免農民視—植棉為畏途—而改種其他作物的弊害。</p>
<p>乙：原棉配給：　規定原棉僅可由政府收買，以免被各廠商自由收買及紡織以後而私賣於黑市。　政府於收買原棉後應公　分配給各紡織廠，使各廠仍得正常地開工出品，以維持其從業員的生活，並增加棉布的生產量以　市民的需要。</p>
<p>食的問題</p>
<p>滬市食米自經採取統制配給制後，其機構雖已數易，然而結果：黑市還是黑市，而目有漲無已，市民口米的配給量則愈配愈少，竟至毫無成效可見。所以吾們咸希望政府能够辦到下述的數點：　賦給糧統會以採購，運輸，和配給的權力與責任，使能　用自如。　出監察院中　選一位「　重法治，不顧情面，勇於負責，廉潔自愛，」的監委來聯合各界民衆團體所派代表共同組織一個超然的—監察委員會—，負責監察　統會的一切進行事宜和利弊</p>
<p>住的問題</p>
<p>長安居，大不易。據說在一八兩區的住房一宅的出頂費，竟有高達十餘萬元的巨數，市房尙不止此數。關於此點，果望政府有更完密的戰時租賃法以保護大多數市民的法益並望當局：</p>
<p>獎勵建築—市政富局應豁免申請興蒙的一切捐地或空地上籌建平屋，　給平民住居。　改良交通—南北　市區的交通設施，應迅加改良和鋪設，俾　一般市民因交通便利而樂於遷居。</p>
<p>行的問題</p>
<p>甲：關於內河的交通：　務使管理船舶的各項規章，嚴格執行，違反者取消其航行權。　為確保旅衆之安全，其船票應按　有艙位出售，於到達次一碼頭時，非有艙位出　，不得再行兜攬乘客。</p>
<p>乙：關於鐵道的交通</p>
<p>丙：關於市內的交通：　啣接全市區各種公共車輛，打成一片，以便利以維持全市交通、如因為節省電力而減少車輛的行駛，則不如從娛樂場所節省　改良售票的手續，變車上購票而為站上購票，</p>
<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田雙維著　洪羊釋</p>
<p>眞人到了暑期課程的時候，每天　餓的不得了。</p>
<p>因為生在南國生的人，對暑氣是不介意的，食慾倒反有增加的傾向。時常要發生餓的，猶其是從早晨到晌午的中間，總是等不及的。因為早晨只吃些麵包罷了。</p>
<p>在早餐前，有游泳訓練，是已經惑到相當的餓困，住食堂跑的脚步也相當的快。到食堂前的時候，必須要慢走的。巳竟聞到芳香的醬湯的氣味，所以緊急待着進到食堂裏去。穿着白色作業服的學生們，在廣大的人口像緩流似地流進去。</p>
<p>不久就要到一線望不到邊際宏大的　堂　去，白色服裝的人充滿着的時候，「開始！」的命令，下來了。</p>
<p>學生們都一齊地就座，並不能即時舉　。必須要靜心，正容，奉誦賜與軍人的五條的勅諭：</p>
<p>軍人宜以盡忠節為本分。　軍人宜正禮儀·　軍人宜尙武勇。　軍人宜重信義。　軍人宜以質　為旨。</p>
<p>一日之中沒有比這再靜肅的瞬間了。决非夜間「五省」時所可比擬的。淸朝的光錢，使作業服的白色，越發　得淸淨無比。奉誦完畢的時候，好像水一般地沉默之中，「開始！」的號令大聲地　者。</p>
<p>在這時候，學生們　靜肅的開始早晨。係餓鬼似地吃法，或者忙忙叨叨的吃法，都是被禁止的。以日本海軍軍人的身分，不致貽笑他人的食儀，是在這食堂裏養成的。從前吃飯的時候，是不許談話的，現在只是不大聲喧嘩就可以了。</p>
<p>眞人將半斤的麵包扯成粉碎的，蘸着糖吃者·那種形狀，和平日是不同的。</p>
<p>一你看你那種嬉皮笑臉的樣子，大概是配者了麵包皮了吧？」在隣席的學生，　着眞人的麵包，倒　者眼鏡這樣的說著。</p>
<p>誰都是一樣半斤的麵包。要陪著麵包皮的時候，容積和重量，都要多些的。學生們呼着遭個呌一帶皮的」——</p>
<p>那樣對食物的渴望，也不過是在四號生時代罷了。到了一號的時候，吃了這一次麵包，便要吃飽了的，絕對不會發生貪婪的顏色。</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>……夏天快來了，八十八夜……正像那歌曲的輕快的節奏，學生們盼著暑假的到來，很快活地唱着這們歌曲，而暑似的日期也天天地接近了，剛到十八歲的　人，是怎樣的盼望着放暑假和歸故鄕，是可想而知的。</p>
<p>在放假的前一天，從宮島來的商人，在養貝館開始販買着土產物。眞人為母親買些杓子和具　做的器具，為陸夫買了嚴島的畫片。</p>
<p>以後他同態澤二人，到分隊監事的　少佐官舍去辦別了。</p>
<p>「從明天起就要放假，回到故鄉去，那麼再見吧一。</p>
<p>向著送出到門口的敎官太太，二人鄭重地行禮吿辭。在四們月的汀田島生活，不知不覺地，二人已經得到了這樣的教養。</p>
<p>但是星期日教官官舍的訪問，是忘却不了的回憶。在敎官的家裏吃飯比到俱樂部去，更要感到一種好像回到自己的家庭似的情緒。敎官同太太，都是這樣厚待學生的。這不但　少佐家是如此，敎官官舍都是如此的。這是傳統的風氣甚至於將來入港時艦長同十官，或士官同兵士的家庭的團聚，也是要如此的。</p>
<h3>社會服務　教師隱貪醫藥助金　本處分送各醫院</h3>

        <h1>1944.02.24</h1>
<h3>Editorial: A Review of the Pacific War Situation</h3>
<p>Question: The Pacific war situation has become increasingly serious recently. What is the enemy's operational motive?</p>
<p>Answer: Strategy cannot be separated from political strategy. Observing the current international situation, the European war has already approached the decisive battle stage. The so-called Anglo-American offensive to open a second front in Europe should be demonstrated with facts. However, in reality, the Soviet Union's offensive has ended, and the conflict and opposition between the United States and the Soviet Union have also begun to develop anew. Therefore, the so-called Anglo-American offensive on the European continent as a second front has been temporarily put aside again, and a political offensive has been adopted. On the one hand, it is attempting to win over neutral countries to isolate Germany. On the other hand, it is holding back and not helping the Soviet Union out of the fire. After the enemy, the Anglo-Americans, made such changes to their European policy, they turned to the Pacific and attempted to realize their ambition, launching the so-called "central breakthrough" offensive. Question: How will the development of the Pacific offensive plan and the future of the war situation develop?</p>
<p>Answer: The enemy's ambitions for a Pacific offensive certainly did not start today. After more than a year of retreat, production, and replenishment, they began attempting a so-called counter-offensive as early as last year, and were defeated by the fighting spirit in Attu Island and the Solomon Islands. In particular, the sea and air battle of Bougainville Island was secretly attempted, but it was completely countered by the Japanese army's application of fierce battles, causing the enemy to suffer the most severe blow since Pearl Harbor. However, the enemy's ambitions have not diminished, and in anger, they are using the situation in Europe to start this new offensive. The war is currently underway, and a comprehensive critique is not yet possible, but observing their attack on the Marshall Islands and then on Truk Island in the Caroline Islands, at least we can get a glimpse of the enemy's greater strategic ambitions. Its future development has a very large relationship to the overall situation in East Asia. Is there any truth to be said?</p>
<p>Answer: This time, the enemy's offensive is different from last year's "island hopping" operation, and has a larger-scale preparation. In terms of strategic requirements, it is probably attempting to lure the main force of the Japanese navy to come out and fight. In practice, it is still conducting sea and air guerrilla warfare in an attempt to destroy maritime transportation lines. Even more noteworthy is the use of the air force stationed in Chongqing-India and the counter-offensive actions on the Burma front. At the same time, its main offensive force is gradually heading towards the Marshall Islands and even the Caroline Islands, attempting a "central breakthrough." Fortunately, the Japanese authorities have long had foresight on this, so they first had the Burma-India operations to "preempt the enemy" and insisted on the active advantage on the Asian continent, and then fully dealt with the stubborn enemies in the Pacific. The most important achievements were the recent sea and air battles of Rabaul and the Marshall Islands, and the naval battle in the Truk area, which gave the sneaky enemy a severe blow, and always maintained the Japanese army's active advantage in East Asia.</p>
<p>Question: Then, can it be said that the overall situation in East Asia is as solid as a fortress? But how can we further victoriously complete the Greater East Asia War? Answer: Although the war situation in Cambodia is still ensured by the Japanese army to be superior, in order to quickly win the final victory, the Japanese authorities have already taken extraordinary decisions, which is the recent adjustment and strengthening of the Japanese cabinet. The main goal of this Japanese cabinet adjustment is to achieve "unity of political and war strategies," with everyone working together to respond to the war situation with a spirit of "active and resolute" to ensure victory. So, we are a participating country, how will we respond to this decisive battle situation?</p>
<p>Answer: We must also further practice our obligation to participate in the war. First, firmly believe in the conviction of victory and do not be moved by rumors. Second, take winning the war as the biggest prerequisite and contribute all possible manpower and material resources. Third, since we do not have troops participating in frontline operations, we should especially do our best to take on the obligation to participate in the war in the rear.</p>

In Borneo, I visited a Japanese language school for Indian Nacis. Most of the young men and women of the local indigenous people have been able to speak fluent Japanese, and all the indigenous people in various places wholeheartedly cooperated with the Japanese military and political authorities in construction, which shows that they already have a sense of the Greater East Asia nation. I inspected a German elementary school in Salachin. These elementary school students also speak Japanese and can sing Japanese songs. I always feel the beauty of Japanese-German friendship and the solidarity of the Axis countries. The abundance of resources in the south is self-evident. Industries such as shipbuilding and industries in Malaysia are all making encouraging progress, and their future is really worth looking forward to.</p>

<h3>"Special Qualities of Naval Warfare and the Belief in Certain Victory" General Takahashi of Japan Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to a telephone call from Kokura, General Takahashi Sankichi of Japan gave a speech at the Kujo Factory of the Japan Iron Mining Company here on the 23rd, explaining the special qualities of naval warfare and the belief in certain victory. The general idea is as follows: Some people in our country believe that the situation in the southern war zone is the same as the situation on the current German-Soviet front. This is actually not understanding the difference between naval warfare and land warfare. The nature of naval warfare and land warfare is very different. Taking the Russo-Japanese War as an example, at that time, the two sides were fighting in the narrow Korean Strait. After only two days of naval battle, the result was known to the people. This naval battle was not about fighting for this narrow strait, but about seizing control of the sea. This is the fundamental quality of naval operations. Today, the southern region is dotted with islands. This is very different from the narrow strait. This has its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is that these islands can be used as air bases, and the disadvantage is that they lack mobility. Therefore, in warfare in these regions, aircraft carriers are often used, but aircraft carriers also have their strengths and weaknesses. The strength is that they have mobility, and the weakness is that they are in danger of being sunk. Therefore, we should strive to make good use of this one to achieve success. Japan and the United States are actively using these two to compete with each other. Some islands have been taken by the enemy, and some people are pessimistic because they are using the perspective of observing the German-Soviet war to observe naval operations. But what we should especially recognize is that every time the enemy takes an island, they must pay a considerable price. The enemy may establish a base after taking the island, but the Japanese naval force has not been destroyed by the enemy, which is what the people should recognize. The final victor who wins control of the sea is the victor. Therefore, we can only repel the enemy's naval power to seize control of the sea, which is also the key to victory. If the enemy approaches our homeland, and the damage they suffer is greater and the loss of strength is greater, this is a sign that we will win. When the enemy's naval power is completely eliminated, we can defeat the enemy. Naval battles have this important characteristic. The enemy is currently extremely anxious and has to take the opportunity to advance the war as soon as possible, but this is actually what we want. I feel very optimistic about the future of the war situation.</p>

<h3>Philippine President Formally Announces State of Emergency; Ready to Adapt to Decisive Battle Posture</h3>
<p>Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) Philippine President Laurel formally signed the Emergency Declaration Act on the 22nd, and the Philippine government immediately announced that the Philippines has entered a state of emergency. In addition, after declaring a state of emergency, in order to adapt to the national emergency, the Philippine government decided to authorize the president in accordance with Article III, Section 13 of the Constitution, so that during the period before the next regular Congress convenes, it can implement various policies to solve the various problems currently faced by the Philippines. Therefore, President Laurel has, in accordance with the law, obtained the power to issue 50 million Philippine pesos of short-term public bonds. In order to accomplish this goal, the president decided to make it a unified effort, and any officials who dare to violate it will be severely punished. In order to establish the permanent foundation of the Philippine Republic according to this new law, the Philippine government has quickly started to implement appropriate policies.</p>
<p>Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) Philippine President Laurel issued a statement saying that the Philippines is now in a state of emergency. President Laurel's announcement this time was made in accordance with the resolution of the First Philippine National Assembly on February 2 this year, that the president has the prerogative to issue an emergency declaration. After President Laurel took this measure, the Philippine Republic is now in a strong decisive battle system, and it has been decided to quickly take appropriate solutions for stabilizing the national life of the Philippines. President Laurel's declaration this time was also issued in accordance with this legislative purpose, in order to implement sensitive and decisive policies at any time in order to adapt to the domestic and foreign situation. It can be seen from this that President Laurel is determined. The specific measures will be to increase the production of miscellaneous grains, implement price controls, and evacuate the population under the personal command of the president. After this, the problem of adapting the Philippines to the decisive battle posture can be quickly resolved, and preparations have now been completed.</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Unfolds Near Nagaedku; Japanese Planes Bomb Enemy Positions in Maungdaw</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base in Burma, a Japanese bombing squadron attacked a certain place on the Maungdaw-Ponnaung-Chaung road on the 22nd, and carried out a brave dive bombing of the enemy's artillery positions, continuously dropping sure-hit giant bombs, causing the enemy's positions to collapse.

<p>The Indian People Are Excited</p>
<p>Burma, 23rd (Central News Agency) After the Indian people learned the news that the Indian National Army was attacking Arakan in pursuit of Indian independence, they were excited. The number of Indian soldiers surrendering to the Japanese army is also increasing day by day, and the future of the Indian independence struggle is full of light. A certain Indian Air Force lieutenant, who surrendered while fighting in the Arakan region, was captured by the Japanese army, and witnessed the fierce fighting of the Indian National Army, expressed his enthusiastic emotions and said: I didn't know about the success of the Indian National Army before, and I didn't even know about the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government. I had heard rumors about the Indian independence movement in Malaya and Burma before, but we always doubted its own strength. This is because each message about the Indian people's struggle, when it is transmitted to India, must be censored and concealed by the British side, and the Indian people are appeased with deception and fraud. I had not heard that the Japanese army had transferred the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to India. This time, I personally witnessed my compatriots fighting for the independence of their motherland and demonstrating their power on the Indian-Burmese border. I began to realize my obligations to the motherland and discovered the light of the future. The British are now mocking the people of India on one side and have lost their trust and loyalty to Britain. I am determined to meet General Bose and do my best for the Provisional Government. We, who are engaged in the divine task of liberating the motherland, must of course sacrifice ourselves. I believe that the Indian people will not lose their enthusiasm for the struggle for freedom. The Indian people, after hearing the news of the National Army's offensive, have recognized the current truth about India, and have once again launched a strong anti-British movement. I vow to make a resolution to participate in the struggle to liberate the motherland.</p>

<h3>Japan's Central and Local Governments United, Agreement Council System Achieves Unexpected Results</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Local Administration Agreement Council, after eight months of experimentation, is gradually getting on track. The achievements of the agreement council system have yielded unexpected results: the strengthening of controlled economy, the unified tendency of totalitarian centralism, and the implementation of local administrative realities are completely integrated. At the same time, because the agreement council should maximize its function in enhancing military production, the close cooperation between the military supply supervision department and the agreement council is becoming increasingly important. At the Local Administration Agreement Council meeting on the 21st, this situation was reviewed in detail, and it was unanimously agreed that the agreement council should establish a system for liaison and investigation with the military supply supervision department, focusing on increasing production in the Kyushu region. The work of using coal has been decided that the head of the Kyushu Local Administration Agreement Council, Governor of Fukuoka Prefecture Yoshida Shigeru, will concurrently serve as the director of the Fukuoka Mining Supervision Bureau. The Minister of Munitions Ministry's military supply supervisor was officially appointed on the 23rd.

Taking this measure as a motivation, the strengthened function of the administrative agreement council will also clearly indicate the government's administrative direction, with the meaning of gradually advancing from the qualitative aspect to the entire region.</p>

<h3>Large German Forces Moving North to Defend the Borders of the Baltic States, German Forces Withdraw from Two Cities in Southern Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the latest reports from Stockholm on the 22nd, German forces have recently moved a large force to the northern front to fully strengthen the defense of the borders of the three Baltic states.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas Agency reports: News of the German withdrawal from Krivoy Rog was mentioned by communications sources last night. German forces covering the withdrawal resisted particularly strong Soviet tank units and infantry all day on Sunday. Two days before, German forces had used engineering units to effectively destroy military or combat-related important facilities in the city's industrial area.

In other news, Marshal Stalin ordered the Soviet forces of the Third Ukrainian Front to immediately occupy Krivoy Rog and the iron ore area on the eve of the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army (23rd).</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Churchill Speaks in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Prime Minister Churchill stated in the House of Commons on Tuesday: The current British and American air raids on Germany should be regarded as the main offensive against the Axis powers, and this bombing will be intensified this spring and summer. The offensive plan against the Axis powers is also based on air raids, and the idea that the activities of aircraft, the important tool of Britain and the United States, should be restricted is unacceptable to the Axis powers. Speaking of the Italian situation, the reason for the disappointing developments is due to the unfavorable climate in Italy. Therefore, the war in Italy will be extremely difficult, because large-scale amphibious operations cannot be carried out on either the eastern or western coasts of Italy. Speaking of the Tehran, Cairo, and Moscow conferences, he said: If the representatives of the three countries could meet once a month, there would be no differences between the three countries. The articles published in Pravda or other newspapers that believe that the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union has cooled down are obviously mistaken. The British Prime Minister also assured the House of Commons that there were no concessions made in the Tehran and Moscow conferences, and that he personally discussed the future of Poland with Chairman Stalin. Stalin is determined to establish a strong, complete, and independent Poland, which Churchill is very pleased with, and he also fully understands the Soviet Union's demand to avoid future attacks from the West. The British will not only cooperate with the Soviet Union militarily to achieve the Soviet Union's security, but this has also been agreed to by the United States. Churchill and Stalin both agreed on the need for Poland's compensation in the west and north at the expense of Germany, and recognized that the Atlantic Charter will not apply to Germany.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States to Use Equal Forces in the Invasion of Western Europe</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Havas Agency quotes London: Prime Minister Churchill told the House of Commons yesterday that the military forces participating in the British and American invasion of Western Europe will be roughly equal. A US senator recently requested that the ratio of invading troops be 77% American and 23% British. Churchill took the opportunity to report on the overall war situation in the House of Commons for several months and replied: The ratio of British and American troops operating in Europe will depend on the duration of the war. If the war lasts for a long time, the number of American troops will increase at any time, because the United States has more reserve military strength than Britain.</p>
<h3>Large German Air Force Unit Crosses the Channel at Night, British Isles Suffer the Biggest Air Raid</h3>

The bomb fragments found in the attacked areas show that the bombs were dropped by Soviet aircraft. Two soldiers were injured in a barracks in the town of Strongler, and several bombs fell in the south of this city, injuring two people and destroying or damaging countless doors and windows.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Helsinki, the Finnish military authorities announced on the 22nd that a Soviet bomber squadron bombed the city of Oulu on the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia in northwestern Finland on the night of the 21st.</p>
<h3>The Importance of the Asian Mainland Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Recluse of Jiangnan</p>
<p>Since the spring of last year, the so-called isolationist faction, centered on US Senator Albert Chandler, and military commentators such as Hanson Baldwin, have shifted the European-first strategy and advocated focusing all efforts on the Pacific counter-offensive. This proposal moved the US government, disregarding Britain's displeasure, and was eventually put forward.</p>
<p>Baldwin's arguments are:</p>
<p>If Japan is allowed sufficient time to maintain and utilize the rich resources of the southern occupied areas, Japan will be strengthened to an invincible position.</p>
<p>If substantial assistance is not provided to the Chongqing government quickly, Chongqing may break away from the anti-Axis common front.</p>
<p>If the European war ends, Britain and the Soviet Union can stop the war, but the United States will have to continue to fight Japan alone.</p>
<p>In an article titled "Pacific Strategy" published in the New York Times, Baldwin boasted about the recent superiority of the United States in the Pacific in terms of air force, ships, and landing operations units, and said: "The war in Europe is a war on land and in the air, so even before the European war ends, the US Navy can use most of it for operations in the Pacific. Therefore, large-scale battles against Japan will begin before the European war ends."</p>
<p>The United States Fears "Time"</p>
<p>What the United States fears most is that "time" will give Japan the opportunity to increase its combat power to an invincible position. Therefore, it always wants to achieve some degree of overall counter-offensive effect, so it comes with a one-transport-two-action large-scale advance. But even the United States itself doubts whether it has the certainty of success, especially its partner Britain, which has great doubts about the success of this move and opposes it. Recently, after the US operation in the Marshall Islands, the comments of British Japan expert and strategist Lieutenant Colonel Clive Grashier and other articles published in the Sunday Observer criticized the unreasonableness of this US counter-offensive and concluded that "the Japanese army's operations will continue to wage a war of attrition on the outer line of its defensive zone. This kind of battle is completely impossible for the Allied forces today, when the European Second Front requires extremely large amounts of materials."</p>
<p>Another reason why the United States is eager for a total counter-offensive in the Pacific is the political opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe. In its strategic war, the Soviet Union has almost completely gained the initiative, while Britain and the United States follow suit. There are countless concrete examples in the Balkan strategy and in the strategies for Central Europe and the Middle East. In order to seek "compensation in the east for what is lost in the west," the United States wants to make up for what it has lost in Europe by gaining in the Pacific. In a recent article in "Look" magazine on US-Soviet relations, US Undersecretary of State Welles said: "Europe is in chaos because of its (Soviet Union's) 'superior mentality'; for Asia, we must give them (the Soviet Union) reasons to trust us." In other words, the result of the opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe is that the United States wants to gain an advantage in the Pacific, which is why it has launched this counter-offensive.</p>
<p>British strategist Lieutenant Colonel Clive Grashier criticized the missteps of the US military's Pacific counter-offensive in the aforementioned discussion, and concluded from the ineffectiveness of the counter-offensive from the sea that "to defeat Japan, the Allied forces must maintain a large operational base in an area of the Asian continent close to Japan." He decisively stated that the Chinese mainland should be that place. The comments of Commander-in-Chief of the US Pacific Fleet Nimitz and Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces MacArthur recently echoed the Lieutenant Colonel's comments. Nimitz said: "The main goal of the recent US Navy offensive in the Pacific is to strengthen the US Air Force's base in China and make it a base for the final offensive against Japan." He also said: "To bomb Japan on a large scale, we can only use bases on the Chinese mainland." Despite its superiority in the navy and air force, it actually carried out a Pacific breakthrough operation, wanting to directly attack the Chinese mainland in one fell swoop. MacArthur said: "Occupying the islands scattered in the Japanese-controlled outer line in the Pacific cannot be regarded as a decisive victory," and emphasized the importance of the mainland front, saying: "To achieve victory, the Allied forces must defeat the Japanese army." Commander Stilwell of the US Army forces in the China-India-Burma area also responded to the statements of the two men, expressing the following remarks: "The Allied forces on the mainland front will send ground and air forces to the Chinese mainland, and launch a real large-scale offensive from the air and land to respond to Admiral Nimitz's operation to destroy the Japanese blockade in the Pacific," and also promoted strengthening the capture of important materials for the heavy.</p>
<p>The Final Battlefield is the Mainland</p>
<p>The above statements all unanimously say that the final battlefield for the decisive battle against Japan is the mainland. There are three points worth noting here:</p>
<p>British strategist Lieutenant Colonel Grashier pointed out the missteps of the US Pacific counter-offensive, and concluded by proposing the importance of the mainland battlefield. The statements of the three US commanders followed suit, admitting the futility of the Pacific counter-offensive.</p>
<p>The three commanders who issued the above statements, as well as the propaganda from the United States and Chongqing, all admitted the difficulties of the United States in opening up the mainland front. That is to say: it is very difficult for the US military to land on the mainland to control the Mariana Islands, Guam, Taiwan, and Hainan Island; and then advance into New Guinea, Fiji, Malaya, and Burma. In fact, this is the case. But when we say it, it is not "difficult," it is "impossible." It has been ten months since the United States began its Pacific counter-offensive, but the results obtained are very insignificant. The United States has recently publicized its advance into the Marshall Islands and Gilbert Islands, and may even proudly boast of its approach to Rabaul and the attack on Truk Island, but Japan, with its well-thought-out strategy and confidence in victory, does not feel any pain, and is still far from its goal. Moreover, Japan's combat power is at its peak today, and the enemy's counter-offensive has a feeling of being at the end of its rope. They themselves already know the difficulty, which means they have lost confidence.</p>
<p>In the remarks of the three men, we can see the cunning habit of Britain and the United States, which is to complete the war at the expense of other countries and other people. Nimitz's statement clearly states: "China has vast human resources, and to conquer Japan, we must mobilize these vast human resources." They are trying to incite the Chongqing government, provide weapons, and drive the Chinese compatriots under the rule of the heavy as cannon fodder for the Japanese attack, and turn Chinese land into a battlefield, and use Chinese sacrifices to complete the war. Of course, we will not allow the enemy's plan, but the enemy will desperately push this plan, strengthening material assistance to the Chongqing government and expanding the air force stationed in Chongqing. We must not take this situation lightly. We have once again encountered a period when we should pay close attention to the mainland battlefield.</p>

This work will be continued by the Industrial Survey Office of the First District Office.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Journalists' Get-Together to Be Held This Saturday</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - The Shanghai Japanese Journalists' Club and the Shanghai Press Federation are the most authoritative institutions in the city's journalistic circles. In the past, the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese journalists has contributed greatly to the country and society. However, due to the busy work of both parties, there have been few opportunities for collective meetings. In order to strengthen cooperation between the two groups, three get-togethers have been held in the past to exchange opinions and strengthen the fourth front.

<h3>Cotton Cloth Rationing Is in Preparation</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the cotton cloth control, the general public has no cotton cloth to buy. Therefore, all parties are eager for the authorities to implement the distribution of cotton cloth based on the number of people in the household. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the relevant parties are currently preparing to handle the distribution, and it is heard that at that time, the 54th-period rice purchase certificate that has been issued but has not been used so far will be used to purchase the cotton cloth. Therefore, it is hoped that the citizens can take good care of the certificate.</p>

<h3>Highly Recommend "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" A New Contribution by Kuganjutuan Troupe</h3>
<p>"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)"! "Robots"! The theatrical masterpiece that has been rumored for half a year has finally met the audience!</p>
<p>This is a new contribution from Kuganjutuan Troupe, a work that Shanghai's theater audience has long been watching.</p>
<p>"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is an ideal play, it is the story of the new world in Shanghai's theater 500 years later. The author, with the passion of a poet, the compassion of a sage, and the wisdom of a prophet, points out the direction of human thought and emotion. It rejects selfishness, rejects cruelty, and points out the eternal truth that what makes humanity immortal is love.</p>
<p>The plot of "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is romantic and strange, but it has a serious and soul-stirring theme.</p>
<p>The background is on a planet, in a factory that manufactures robots. At that time, the progress of science was such that even humans, the creators of all things, could be manufactured using chemical equations. This factory is dedicated to manufacturing robots to replace humans in work. They can do the same work, are more efficient, and do not need wages or food. What is present in this factory is merely mechanical life, with a lack of human warmth. One day, a lady from Earth accidentally fell into the planet due to a rocket accident, which greatly shocked the air in this planet. On the one hand, a new continent was discovered in the sea of emotions, and on the other hand, because the manufacturing of robots gradually progressed, they finally reached the point of having flesh and blood, and also having thoughts and feelings, able to cry and laugh. But tragedy followed. The robots united and finally destroyed all the real humans in the world, leaving only one engineer. The greater tragedy is that the robots have a certain lifespan and will break down, and gradually even the robots in the universe will be extinct. Fortunately, the last pair of robots not only knew how to resist, but also understood mutual help, and developed love, proving that there is still hope in the world, and there is still the light and warmth of the spring sun.</p>
<p>Kuganjutuan Troupe spent a great deal of time, manpower, and resources preparing for "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)", whether it was the equipment, costumes, props, lighting, effects, or music, they were all painstakingly made and completed with great effort - because they are all from 500 years later. The performance of "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is undoubtedly an unprecedented event in the Chinese theater world, enough to give the Shanghai people a fresh look.</p>
<p>"R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)" is originally written by Karel Čapek, adapted by Shi Zhizhao, Zhou Qingkeng, and Situ Yansheng, directed by Shi Hui, and is scheduled to be grandly presented at the Paris Grand Theater starting on the evening of the 25th.</p>

<p>Accumulated Virtue Small Ball: Wenyin Defeats Anhua</p>
<p>The South China Wins Recovery Cup Small Ball League continued yesterday, with seven matches in total. In the A group match between South China and Recovery, the game was extremely exciting. Commentators believed South China would win 2-1. The match between Wenyin and Anhua was thrilling and tense, but due to eagerness to win, the players' behavior was somewhat rough, which was regrettable. In the end, Wenyin narrowly won 2-1. To rectify sportsmanship, the organizers will punish illegal players. The results of the seven matches are listed below:</p>
<p>Southern Alliance defeats Minzhi (B2) 2-0, Xinghua defeats Yilian (B2) 2-0, Qian Club B defeats Agricultural Workers (B1) 3-0, Longjie defeats First High School Electric (B1) 4-0, Central Land B defeats National Friends (B1) 2-0, South China defeats Recovery (A group) 2-.</p>

<p>Time of Newspaper Publication Yesterday: 7 o'clock</p>
<p>In a Dense Fog</p>
<p>In its reply regarding the resignation of Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission, the phrase "leaving people as if lost in a dense fog" was used. We feel that this phrase perfectly captures the economic situation in Shanghai. Indeed, in Shanghai, which economic matter does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog? Since the implementation of the controlled economy, the essential goods for daily life have been subject to control. Various control and allocation agencies have been established, displaying glittering signboards, managing the control and allocation work. Why then is the black market rampant, and the scarcity of goods becoming increasingly severe day by day? Furthermore, concerning the trading of Chinese stocks, there are clearly detailed rules and regulations in place to punish speculators. Why is it that since the establishment of the Chinese Stock Management Agency, the speculation in stocks has not only not diminished but has intensified, even fueling the advancement of stock speculation techniques? All of this, which matter does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog?</p>
<p>Returning to the main topic of this phrase, the people's desire for the allocation of cotton yarn did not begin today. Recently, over fifty cloth factories in western Shanghai requested the Commercial Control Commission to allocate cotton yarn to maintain their operations and the livelihoods of their workers. At the same time, there are rumors that the Shanghai Special Municipality Cloth Guild is collecting campaign fees from retail merchant members, which the Commercial Control Commission has ordered to be thoroughly investigated immediately. Simultaneously, Director Nie of the Cotton Industry Management Office of the Commercial Control Commission suddenly resigned. When these pieces of news are put together, which one does not leave people feeling as if lost in a dense fog? In short, regarding cotton yarn, at a time when "the work of ending purchases is intense, and the issue of allocation is complex," it is truly inappropriate to reverse course midway, causing the hopes of millions of people to be delayed again and again. This is our only wish.</p>
<h3>North China Trade Control Association: Adjusting the Supply of Materials, Striving to Facilitate Merchants</h3>
<p>The North China Trade Control Association established its Shanghai office earlier this month at No. 100 Bund, Xingya Building. Since its opening, it has spared no effort in adjusting the supply of materials and carefully planning for surpluses and deficits. According to Deputy Director Xu Hanwen yesterday, since the office was in the early stages of establishment, many matters required attention. In addition to contacting relevant agencies in Shanghai to achieve effective cooperation, it has strived to facilitate merchants (Japanese merchants). In particular, it recently announced that all vegetables, fruits, dried fruits, and other goods produced in Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Henan, and other places must first obtain a transportation permit from the Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market before being brought into Central China. However, for the sake of overall distribution and fairness, the statutory procedures and quantities must be approved by the office before they can take effect.</p>
<h3>British and American Opinions on the War Against Japan are Completely Inconsistent: Spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department Speaks</h3>
<p>According to a Central News Agency report, the regular press conference hosted by the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM on the eighth floor of the Junmao Hotel on Nanjing Road. Representatives from the Army Press Department included Lieutenant Sakamoto and Trustee Akahoshi, along with reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city. At the conference, the spokesperson for the department delivered a speech on the divergent opinions regarding the anti-Axis general counteroffensive against Japan, as follows:</p>
<p>Divergence of Opinions Between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesperson first pointed out the content of the speech given by Admiral Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, on February 9. According to Nimitz, there is no other area besides the mainland of Chongqing to destroy Japan's operational base. Therefore, he plans to transfer the Army Air Force to Chongqing. He then mentioned the speech given by General MacArthur, Commander of the U.S. Southwest Pacific, on February 16. According to MacArthur, it is fundamentally difficult to determine the outcome of the war by occupying the Japanese-held islands scattered throughout the Pacific. MacArthur also stated that present-day Japan is not a maritime empire but rather an undoubtedly strong continental power. Therefore, to defeat Japan's continental power, it is necessary to defeat the Japanese army. He then cited the opinion of British military strategist Lieutenant Colonel Gashia, expressed during the American attack on the Marshall Islands. Lieutenant Colonel Gashia is familiar with the situation in Japan. He stated that the Japanese army is fighting outside its defense line and is continuing to wage a war of attrition. Currently, the Second European Front requires a large amount of resources. However, from the perspective of the Allied forces, such an operation is impossible. Lieutenant Colonel Gashia further explained that to defeat Japan, the Allied forces need to secure a vast operational base in Asia close to Japan. In other words, only with such a base can Japan be defeated. The Japanese spokesperson also said that the above statements differ from U.S. President Roosevelt's island-hopping strategy. MacArthur's strategy is not island-hopping; unimportant islands can be abandoned. This clearly shows the inconsistency of American opinions. However, judging from Nimitz's proposal, it seems that he intends to break through the central Pacific and acquire an operational base in China to attack Japan in one fell swoop. Although Nimitz and MacArthur hold the same view, using the Chinese mainland as an operational base, one must ask what method can be used to defeat Japan? The opinion of the British Japan expert Lieutenant Colonel Gashia is to acquire a large base in Burma. However, the United States regards the Pacific as the starting point. Therefore, the opinions of the United States and Britain are completely inconsistent.</p>
<p>Conflicting Newspaper Commentary</p>
<p>The Japanese representative then pointed out that the Washington Post commentary on February 19 stated that Admiral Nimitz's proposal to defeat the Japanese army is based on the premise of breaking the Japanese army. However, to defeat the Japanese army, this point is quite vague. Even if it becomes a reality, Chongqing will inevitably become isolated, because Chongqing lacks supplies and urgently needs assistance. In addition, although the Chongqing-India air transport is increasing, once the operation plan is implemented, even more massive reinforcements will be needed in the future. Referring to the above, the current aid supplies are not abundant, and it will be even more difficult to increase supplies in the future. It is also feared that it will be difficult to launch a large-scale operation in Burma. The newspaper criticized this, pointing out the inconsistency of the Pacific operation. According to the Washington Post, in the Southeast Pacific, Lord Mountbatten, as the Allied Commander, wants to launch a vigorous operation in Burma to aid Chongqing. But what is the reality today? And what is the difference between what is said and what is actually happening? This is a big question. The Japanese spokesperson also pointed out that the Chongqing Saodang News, published on the 11th, stated in its commentary that the British Indian army under Mountbatten is taking active offensive measures to regain Burma. But the actual situation is the opposite. The first to take active offensive measures is not Mountbatten's troops, but the Japanese army. In the near future, when the rainy season arrives, the Japanese army can calmly prepare to fight. The Chongqing Dagong Bao said on the same day that the British army in India is not suitable for combat and that the American and Chongqing armies are fighting Japan separately in the Pacific and on the mainland. But what is the British army doing? The newspaper specifically pointed out that Britain is holding back its troops. It has been quite a long time since Mountbatten took office. What has he accomplished? This is also a big question.</p>
<p>Filled With Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>The Japanese spokesperson then cited reliable information that the British advocate destroying Burmese industry, bombing it at any time. In addition, increasing air transport from India to Chongqing seems to be the main objective. A counteroffensive is not their current priority. Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing has also expressed his opinion, deeply concerned that Japan is preparing to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. To hinder Japan's plan to open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, he urged a swift counteroffensive in Burma. Therefore, summing up the views of all parties, it is evident that Britain, the United States, and Chongqing cannot agree. Chongqing is filled with dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. We must clearly observe that whether Britain and the United States launch a counteroffensive against Japan from the Pacific or Burma, their plans are completely inconsistent. In summary, what Britain and the United States are doing is exaggerating their official propaganda to the extreme. In reality, there is no progress. This proves that Britain and the United States are bound to fail and gain nothing. It should be known that Japan's actions will undoubtedly lead to their failure. Therefore, on the Second Front in Burma, the enemy is again taking battle in Arakan, appearing again before our eyes. Finally, he said that after the Free India National Army joined the war in Burma, the impact has been significant. The morale of the British and Indian armies has been greatly shaken. To date, more than a thousand have surrendered. Therefore, the Indian National Army's participation in the war has been quite successful. With a spirit of advancing on one hand and returning home on the other, their morale is high and they are quite effective. Therefore, with collaborative operations, significant progress can be expected.</p>
<p>Stillwell's Close Call</p>
<p>The spokesperson for the Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai disclosed at yesterday's press conference that a correspondent from the American Associated Press had recorded an incident in which General Stilwell, commander of the US Fourteenth Air Force stationed in Yunnan, narrowly escaped death while inspecting the front lines in Burma. He ridiculed Stilwell's ugly behavior at the time. The spokesperson first said that the American reporter from the Associated Press accompanied General Stilwell and his staff on an inspection of the front lines in Burma. In the Fugong Creek Valley on the India-Burma border, they were attacked by Japanese troops with 75mm howitzer shells, narrowly escaping a direct hit. They then feared crossing a muddy area with a narrow, winding path, and were again fired upon by Japanese troops. When one shell exploded in the wet area, one person was severely shaken and fainted on the spot. When the second shell passed close by Stilwell, Stilwell was terrified and fell to the ground, shouting that the hilltop was collapsing. The scene of his disarray was unbearable. We can see from the above the smooth progress of the Japanese army and their calm attitude. Conversely, the exaggerated propaganda and embarrassing failures of the anti-Axis forces are self-evident.</p>
<h3>Hoarding and Profiteering: Hoping Citizens Will Report</h3>
<p>Recently, rising prices have significantly impacted people's livelihoods. The reason for this is not the inevitable trend of real supply and demand or rising costs but is mostly due to manipulation and hoarding. It is understood that to suppress prices, the authorities, in addition to fundamental measures such as increasing production and unblocking sources, and strict implementation of the "Temporary Regulations on Wartime Price Management" and its implementation measures promulgated by the National Government in order to address the superficial aspects, are also actively implementing various appropriate measures. It is hoped that citizens will report any instances of hoarding, and they will be severely punished in accordance with the "Regulations on Punishing Hoarding" and the "Special Criminal Law During Wartime."</p>
<h3>Soap, Candles, and Matches Rise in Price Repeatedly: Authorities Consider Purchasing</h3>
<p>In the past week, the prices of soap, candles, and matches have soared repeatedly. Concerned authorities, given that these daily necessities have become targets of hoarding by unscrupulous merchants in Chongqing, severely impacting citizens' lives, the city authorities have decided to impose severe punishment and are considering concrete plans for compulsory purchase.</p>

<h3>National Forum - The Four Major Livelihood Issues at the Present Stage</h3>
<p>— Chen Ren Shi</p>
<p>The Issue of Clothing</p>
<p>Clothing is to cover the body and protect against the cold. In recent years, due to the impact of the war, the production of raw cotton has decreased. The current allocation of cotton cloth is being implemented promptly, but it can only maintain the present for a short time. If we do not strive to increase production, it will be useless, because the manufactured products will eventually be used up. Therefore, in addition to implementing allocation, we must also:</p>
<p>A: Encourage Cotton Planting: The government should sell high-quality seeds to farmers at the lowest possible price, and guide them in scientific planting methods and prevention methods. When the government buys raw cotton, it should consider the interests of the farmers themselves and their legitimate profits and costs to determine a purchase price per kilogram, so as to avoid the harm of farmers viewing cotton planting as a daunting task and switching to growing other crops.</p>
<p>B: Raw Cotton Allocation: It should be stipulated that raw cotton can only be purchased by the government, so as to prevent it from being freely purchased by various manufacturers and then secretly sold on the black market after being spun and woven. After the government purchases raw cotton, it should publicly and fairly allocate it to various textile factories, so that the factories can still operate normally and maintain the livelihoods of their employees, and increase the production of cotton cloth to meet the needs of the citizens.</p>
<p>The Issue of Food</p>
<p>Since Shanghai adopted the system of controlled food allocation, its organization has changed several times, but the result is still: the black market is still the black market, and prices have only risen, never fallen. The amount of rice allocated to the citizens has become less and less, to the point where no effective results can be seen. Therefore, we all hope that the government can achieve the following points: Give the Grain Control Commission the power and responsibility to purchase, transport, and allocate, so that it can use it freely. Elect a member of the Control Yuan who "emphasizes the rule of law, disregards personal relationships, dares to take responsibility, and is honest and self-disciplined" to jointly organize a detached Supervisory Committee with representatives from various community groups to be responsible for supervising all the actions and interests of the Grain Control Commission.</p>
<p>The Issue of Housing</p>
<p>It is not easy to live in Chang'an. It is said that the transfer fee for a house in the first and second districts is as high as hundreds of thousands of yuan. The cost of the city's housing is even higher than this number. Regarding this point, it is hoped that the government has more complete wartime rental laws to protect the legal interests of the majority of citizens and that the authorities:</p>
<p>Encourage Construction: The Municipal Government should exempt all donations for the construction of simple houses on leased land or vacant land to provide housing for ordinary people. Improve Transportation: The transportation facilities in the north-south urban areas should be quickly improved and laid out so that the general public is happy to move due to convenient transportation.</p>
<p>The Issue of Transportation</p>
<p>A: Regarding Inland River Transportation: The various regulations for managing ships must be strictly enforced, and those who violate them will have their navigation rights revoked. To ensure the safety of passengers, tickets should be sold according to the number of available berths. When arriving at the next pier, passengers should not be solicited again unless there are berths available.</p>
<p>B: Regarding Railway Transportation</p>
<p>C: Regarding Urban Transportation: Connect all types of public vehicles in the city into one unit to facilitate and maintain urban transportation. If reducing the number of vehicles to save electricity, it is better to save on entertainment venues. Improve the ticket purchase procedure, changing from purchasing tickets on the bus to purchasing tickets at the station.</p>
<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Iwata Soji, Translated by Hong Yang</p>
<p>When the real man arrived at the summer courses, he was always extremely hungry every day.</p>
<p>Because he was born in the south, he didn't mind the summer heat, and his appetite tended to increase instead. He often felt hungry, especially between morning and noon, and he could never wait. This was because he only ate some bread for breakfast.</p>
<p>Before breakfast, there was swimming training, which made him feel quite hungry and tired, and he ran to the dining hall quite quickly. Before arriving at the dining hall, he had to walk slowly. After all, he could smell the fragrant miso soup, so he waited impatiently to enter the dining hall. Students wearing white work clothes flowed into the vast dining hall like a slow stream.</p>
<p>Soon, they would go to the huge hall where the edge could not be seen, and when it was filled with people in white clothes, the command "Start!" would be given.</p>
<p>The students all sat down together and could not immediately raise their chopsticks. They had to calm their minds, compose themselves, and recite the five articles of the Imperial Rescript given to soldiers:</p>
<p>Soldiers should make loyalty their primary duty. Soldiers should uphold etiquette. Soldiers should value martial courage. Soldiers should emphasize integrity. Soldiers should be simple and unadorned in their conduct.</p>
<p>There was no moment more solemn than this in the entire day. It was by no means comparable to the "Five Reflections" at night. The clear sunlight made the white of the work clothes appear even more pure and spotless. When the recitation was finished, in the silence like water, the command "Start!" was shouted loudly.</p>
<p>At this time, the students began their morning quietly. Eating like hungry ghosts or eating in a hurried manner was forbidden. Cultivating dining etiquette that would not be laughed at by others as a Japanese naval soldier was nurtured in this dining hall. In the past, talking was not allowed during meals, but now it was only required not to be loud.</p>
<p>The real man tore half a catty of bread into pieces and ate it dipped in sugar. That appearance was different from usual.</p>
<p>"Hey, look at you grinning like that, you probably got the bread crust, right?" The student next to him, looking at the real man's bread, said while adjusting his glasses.</p>
<p>Everyone had the same half catty of bread. When getting the bread crust, the volume and weight would be more. The students called it "with skin."</p>
<p>That kind of craving for food only happened during their fourth year. By the time they were in their first year, they would be full after eating this one serving of bread and would never show any signs of greed.</p>
<p>(Eight)</p>
<p>…Summer is coming soon, the eighty-eighth night… Just like the light rhythm of that song, the students were looking forward to the arrival of summer vacation, singing this song happily, and the date of summer vacation was approaching day by day. It is conceivable how much the eighteen-year-old real man was looking forward to summer vacation and returning to his hometown.</p>
<p>The day before the vacation, merchants from Miyajima began selling local products at the shell-raising hall. The real man bought some ladles and clam-made utensils for his mother and picture postcards of Itsukushima for Rikuo.</p>
<p>Afterward, he and Tazawa went to the official residence of Lieutenant Commander Kata, the division supervisor, to say goodbye.</p>
<p>"From tomorrow, we will be on vacation and returning to our hometowns, so goodbye."</p>
<p>The two bowed solemnly to the instructor's wife, who saw them off at the door. In the four months of life on Etajima Island, the two had unknowingly gained such education.</p>
<p>However, Sunday visits to the instructors' official residences were unforgettable memories. Eating at the instructor's home felt more like returning to one's own family than going to the club. Both the instructor and his wife treated the students so kindly. This was not only the case at Lieutenant Commander Kata's home, but at all the instructors' official residences. This was a traditional atmosphere, and even in the future, when entering port, gatherings of ship captains and officers, or officers and soldiers' families, should be like this.</p>
