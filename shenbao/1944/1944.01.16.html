<h3 id="c1">星期評論　類無敎有　吉田東祐 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>兩星期前，我在本報上發表過「論戀愛」一篇文章。在該文裹，我雖然會聲明過，日本是「以平等待」中國的，但中國的知識份子，却仍然不相信日本人會眞正以平等待中國的。這就是中日問題的重要焦點。我會說，假如日本能解除這一中國人的疑慮，而在實際生活當中，能眞正表示出以平等的精神對待中國，則中國人無論什麽時候，都會衰心協助日本的。我還曾以這種關係　喻作男女的戀愛，就是男人如想獲得女性的心，則不要單純講甜言畫語的話，而更重要者，必須在實際生活的鎖碎小事中，流露出眞情實意來。不料這樣一篇文章，竟惹起一位讀者寄來一封淋漓盡致的指責信。原信如下：</p>
<p>「吉田東祐先生：你的論文眞感動我了。你眞是一個同情中國的日本人，每次報紙送到，我只要發覺有你的文章，必須靜心下氣的讀下去。最近讀到你的「談戀愛」的中節，使我痛哭而流淚。但是讀到末節，我竟然大駡你了。你究竟還不是中國通，因為中國一向重男輕女，而你竟拿我們堂堂的中國比仿作一個女人，這種對我們的侮辱，我是永久不會忘却的。你讀過我們的「三國演義」嗎？孔明以婦人衣冠送給司馬懿，而你今日却以女人名義送給中國人，竟然有異曲同工之妙。今後發表文章，應再三注意，否則我要駡你了。</p>
<p>「以前我以為申報上發表你的文章，是從日文報紙雜誌譯來的，現在明白了你的文章，不能在日文報紙雜誌賣錢，而只在中報上發表。這明明是以迎合中國人的脾胃，造成投機的文學家，這可恥孰甚！今後希望你將文章，先在日文報紙雜誌上發表。我有幾個問題，是你寫文章的好材料。請你研究一下。……」（這位讀者在信中所提出的許多問題，全是此處不可能發表的文字，所以只好删去）。</p>
<p>這位讀者對於我的文章如此特別關心，這一點是値得我感謝的。至於對我的非難和指責，並不是沒有什麽話可回敬的。第一，這位讀者雖然自稱是中國人，但對中國的社會現狀，却似乎觀察不足。因在中國的知識份子當中，男女平等，早巳不成為間題了。目前新的人物間，並不認為中國婦女的社會地位，是比男人低的。舉一個極端的例來看，試觀重慶的宋美齡，那一個男入不在她的面前低頭認輸呢？白居易不是說過麽？「姊妹兄弟皆列土，可憐光彩生鬥戶，遂令天下父母心，不重生男重生女」。請看，宋美齡是具有這樣大的勢力。在和平區內，也並不是絕對找不出這樣類似的現象。總而言之，像該讀者那樣的女性觀，在今日的中國進步份子當中，是絕無僅有的。何况我是主張中日關係，必須像平等的男女間之正當戀愛一樣呢？所以這位讀者對我的非難，完全是無的放矢。</p>
<p>第二，我不用日文發表，而專在中報上寫迎合中國人脾胃的文章，於是就被這位讀者認集是投機文學家，只在這一點上，該讀者算說對了。我以中文發表文章，當然就不能不迎合中國人的脾胃。如果成篇累牘地為一些中國人毫不感興味，且根本不能接受的宣傳文字之類，那未我就認為是浪費紙張。正常高唱「節約論調」的今天，這種宣傳文字「論調」，我認為是應當先加以「節約」的。然而可借得很，目前上海大部份的刊物裏，却汗牛充棟地充斥着這類一邱之貉的文章。假如認為我「投」這樣的「機」，而寫多少迎合中國人脾胃的文章，是所謂「投機文學家」，那末就請原諒我，不客氣地拜領這個「稱讀之辭」了。再者，假如說我的文章是花言巧語，欺騙中國人的宜傳，那末讀者就該指摘出來，我文章的那一點，是具有欺騙性的？我一向都歡迎別人對我的指摘。對中國人寫中國人高興的文章，即爲可恥的投機文學家，這一點似乎不大合邏輯。何况我又决不是專門寫迎合中國人脾胃的文章的呢？其實，倒勿寗說，我寫駡人的話，或許更多些。此外關於不用日文發表的理由，業已在別處講過，恕不另贅。（請參閱去年十二月二十八日本報第四版吉田東祐「答復一讀者」－編者註）</p>
<p>這位讀者的頭腦，對於這樣簡單的理論，都分不出靑紅皂白來，或許會有人以為這個讀者的頭腦不靈，而有先天不足的缺陷。那末筆者對於這樣幼稚的讀者，竟諄諄回答不倦，也許會受到對牛彈零之　吧！然而筆者認為，在這對信中所表現的一個讀者的幼稚及其謬誤中，却含有重大的意義。這就是該讀者的心情，正如明治維新時代，日本志士所具有的心情一樣，充滿着民族自尊心。如一碰到似乎傷及這種民族自尊心的人時，就立刻氣衛斗牛，憤慨萬分，而就無法再用冷靜頭腦來控制自己。所以這位讀者一看到我把中國　作婦女，便不管文章的主旨何在，立刻大發雷霆。至於這位讀者對我的其他誤解，全是由於這種民族自尊心所致。然而這種思想，在目前中國靑少年當中，可以說是一種普遍的傾向。暫且回想一下，明治維新時代的我們日本靑年，也曾對於認為威脅日本自由獨立的所謂「洋夷」，抱着無限的民族同仇敵懷心理。當時日本靑年間，最負衆望的學者詩人，即是常陽（常陸）的藤田東湖。他所寫的漢詩，是維新時代的靑年層最喜歡歌吟的，其中有一首詩，如下：（以下轉入第四版）。</p>

<p>阿根廷京城十五日中央社電　太平洋新不列顚島阿羅挨地區戰况，最近益趨激烈。傳該方面美軍所死守之阿羅埃半島，因日軍不停之進攻，巳瀕於危境。據十四日西南太平洋某基地美聯社電稱：傳本週由阿羅埃半島前綫司令部歸還之西南太平洋反軸心軍司令部之發言人，謂日軍曾數度攻擊阿羅埃半島及美軍占領之陣地，該方面美軍第陸軍部隊現仍死守該半島附近島嶼及內陸地區之狹小地域，而日軍與美軍刻距百哩之間對峙中。</p>
<p>東京十五日中央社電　中太平洋日軍某基地訊：日海軍機對吉爾貝特羣島之攻擊，最近漸趨　熾烈，同時敵機亦不時對馬紹爾羣島施以小規模之反　襲擊，致該方面之日美空軍决戰日趨活潑化，日海軍機隊十二日晨曾連續兩次聶炸吉爾貝特羣島之達拉瓦島，猛炸敵機塲及軍事設施使其一處中彈兩處起火，日機全部返防，敵於同日下午亦會以E24型機九架，來襲馬紹爾羣島馬累拉浦礁島之塔羅娃，日海軍戰鬥機隊當即邀擊。擊毀其一架。又敵艦土聶炸機三十架及P34型機十架共四十架，繼於十三日上午來擊馬紹爾羣島之米勒島，被日軍守備隊高射砲火擊落一架。</p>

<p>中央社滬訊財政部稅務署，奉令舉辦戰時消費特稅，巳指定蘇浙皖三省京滬兩特別市重要市縣十五處，定於今（十六）日起，先行開征第一項物品零售，及第二項筵席旅館兩種消費特稅。上海特別市一八兩區內，應征特稅，由市政府一八兩區公署財務處代征外，其他各區市縣，則由稅務署所屬各稅務分局辦理。其開征消費特稅區域，自實施日期起，所有各地方原有征收之物品零售捐，及筵席捐旅館捐一律停止·同港財政部周部長，稅務署邵男長，對於開征消費特稅事，特分別發表談話，茲將各情分誌如下：</p>
<p>消費特稅品目</p>
<p>該署開征消費特稅，共分物品零售筵席旅館娛樂三項。第一項物品零售特稅，其所規定；　金銀珠寶鑽石象牙等，及其製成品類．　骨董古玩類｀　繡花　　地毯·　貴重皮貨，（紫貂海虎玄狐等類）及其製成品。　樂器，唱機唱片攝影機影片，及其附屬之用品零件。　骨牌，麻雀牌，撲克牌，花紙牌，骰子等，為奢侈品外，其他均為普通物品。第二項，筵席旅館特稅，凡在國內開設旅館，公寓，茶室，咖啡室，酒菜館以及其他類似塲所供人食宿者，代征特稅。所收每次賬款內得除去。　洗衣費。　服務賞金。　　電費。　其他代支費用等各項費用後，再計算稅款。第三項娛樂特稅，分為（甲）電影賽馬，音樂，跑冰，游泳等。（乙）戲劇，歌唱，說書，演後等。（丙）其他跳舞等奢侈娛樂。</p>
<p>召徵消費特稅</p>
<p>其各種物品應免徵零售消費特稅者，計有；　已經完納筵席旅館消費特稅者。　新聞紙類。　學校用之敎科書。　米麥雜糧及其磨粉，乾燥麵，生麵，大餅，油條，麵包饅頭，食糖，食豐，醬油，醬醋，食用油采蔬。　煤，煤球，木炭，木柴，及各種柴草，煤氣，電氣，水熱，水冰。　凡僅收工賣，不以物品買賣為營業者。　其他由政府命令指定免徵之物品。</p>
<p>周部長談話</p>
<p>財政部周部長佛海，發表談話云：「國家的預算，原來是量出為入的，况在戰爭時期，各國都無不大量加稅，以穩定財政基礎。我國自參戰以後，一切支出浩繁，支出旣大，勢不能不增加收入，以期收支的平衡，這是當然的事情，因此不能不加稅。但是加稅就要增加人民的負担，國家財政因難，當然需要人民來協助，但同時人民的經濟能力，亦不能不顧着，要怎樣才能使人民比較的容易負担，因此中央經過再三的考慮，始决定舉辦消費特稅，交由本部稅務署主管辦理。所以舉辦這幾項消費特稅，有下列幾點理由：　這幾種捐稅，各地方多巳舉辦，人民納稅已有相當的習慣。　直接取之消費者，並非取之營業商人，使營業商人不能藉此加稅，來提高物價。　消費力量大的人，則稅部妨多納點。消費力量小的人，稅就可以少納負担是很公允的。　非常時期，事事應該節約，不必要的消費可省就省。這幾種消費特稅，含有限制消費，厲行節約的作用。在裏面有此種種理由，所以我覺得辦理這幾種消費特稅，還算比較最妥當的。至於各稅稅率的規定，亦曾多方考慮。第一就是要顧着一般人民的經濟能力，第二要帶有促進節約的效用，間接使人民經濟不致浪費。本此兩大原則來規定各稅的稅率，所以就中以娛樂消費特稅稅率為最高，娛樂稅之中，尤以奢侈性的娛樂稅率為更高。而以普通物品零售稅稅率為最低。普通品之中，如米，麥，雜糧，煤球，柴炭等等，而且統統免稅。政府像這樣愼重辦理，我很希望人民方面能一體諒解與政府協力合作。我尤希望各種營業商人，應以國家稅收為重，勿食一己的私利，假借高抬物價，如有發現，政府自當嚴懲，應遵照各種章則，竭誠辦理，務使消費者拿出一分稅款，國庫即多一分收入，這是我所最希望的」云云·</p>
<p>署長談話</p>
<p>財政部稅務署邵署長，為征收消費特稅事，發表談話如下：查我國稅法，向皆取之於商，轉嫁人民之一種間接稅制。稅收旣難普及，辦法亦見協部。根據過去情況，問接稅破易刺激物價直上漲，因貨利貸，難期平衡。此次本署奉令開徵物品·零售·筵席。旅館。及娛樂等三種消費特稅，即係直接取諸消費者之直接稅，並不增重商民負担，且與商業絕無關係，按此辦法，在今世歐亞交戰多國，因戰事之需要，莫不節約物資，採取直接稅法，使人人有納稅義務，共負國事之艱鉅。中央有鑒及此，毅然創行，先就各大都市，由本署督飭所屬，定期向人民直接徵取，漸及其他各地，毋再由商轉嫁人民。蓋一則當禁於徽，可以節約物資；一則減低消費力量，可以助長生產，且可避免刺激物價上漲之流弊。此則對於國運之昌隆，關係至鉅，希望人民應了解間接稅與直接稅之性質，共匡時艱。又不能高抬物價，影響民生。蓋政府對此次徵收消費特稅，為顧念人民負擔，已經長時期之研討。如日用必需品物，因有　人民生計，必須免徵稅收，與奢侈物品之無　民生，必須從重徵收等等，均會斟酌盡響，始決定施行。茲將消費特稅稅率，約略分述如後：</p>
<p>免稅類　日用必需物品，如米麥雜糧煤炭木柴，各種柴草，煤氣需氣水熱水冰，以及新聞紙類，學校等均與民生有密切關係者，槪予免徵消費特稅。</p>
<p>各種普通物品之規定稅率，為從價百分之四，其屬金銀珠寶鑽石象牙等製品，骨董古玩繡花帘幔地毯紫貂玄狐等貴重皮貨，樂器唱機片攝影機片及其附島零件，暨骨牌等，奢侈物品，均與民生無關，一律從價征收百分之</p>
<p>筵席旅館近乎奢靡消費，是以暫定從價征收百分之十五。至於娛樂消費稅率，亦經分別輕重，規定為百分之十至百分之四十。俟確定開征日期，再行公佈。以上各點，均係犖犖大者，希望各地商店，及直接消費民衆，共體時艱，撙節物資，努力生產，踴躍輸將，是所厚望也。</p>

<p>本日全國經濟委員會開會，鄙人適因感冒發熱，特托周副委員長代為主席，謮致簡短之辭如后：今年經濟建設，置重點於增產，前日通過上半年度槪算，亦置重點於此。所謂增產，以糧食增產棉花增產二者為先，且農業之外尤須注意於輕工業，如紗布麵粉諸工業皆是。深望諸位先生共心協力，完成此舉。尤有言者，肅正思想，保障治安，增加生產，三者互相關聯。政府方面應注全力於生產者之保護。務使生產者能享受生產所得，外來滋擾，如匪共之刦奪，中間剝削，如不肖官吏之中飽，不良軍隊之敲　，務必禁絕。社會方面則應澈底明瞭增產之意義，所謂增產，一方面增强吾人之生產力，一方面即使吾人更有力量，以貢獻於大東亞戰爭，兩奢幷進，興華保並，有賴於此，願與諸位先生共勉之。一月十五日，注兆銘。</p>
<p>國府經濟施策確立推進方針</p>
<p>南京十五日中央社電全國經濟委員會第三次全體委員會議，業於十五日在京圓滿舉行，由於全體出席委員之誠擊熱烈，融洽協議，所有關於增產等全部耍議案十四件，均經逐一聞密審議，順利通過。故本屆會議之收獲，實較歷屆會議之收獲更為偉大。蓋第一二兩屆會議，僅係確立國府戰時經濟政策，及厘訂具體之經濟建設計劃。現第三次會議，其客觀環境巳與前兩屆會議時迥然不同，今年為大東亞戰爭决勝年，為獲得最後决戰之勝利，巳不斷動員一切人力物力，故本屆會議所負之重要使命，即為提示解决此項重要課題，增產之具體實施方案，經此次會議結果，對該項重要課題，已有各項具體方案之議决。綜觀此次全部議决案中，內如調節農村金融計劃等，及復興工業計劃等，有　設國營農廠，設置產業振興總會，救濟燃料恐慌辦法，恢復各廠商需要電力，推進淮南一帶鹽墾工作等案，均為目前推進增產工作之重要問題。他如關於整理幣制者，則有早日宣佈戰後整理幣制方針，以安定人心之决議，關於增裕國家稅收，及吸收游資等者，則有增收不動產稅，及由官方監督辦理地產公司之經營等致議決。關於調飭民食節約消費者，則有食糧征收及分配辦理實施綱要，及節約運動等要案之决議。此外更有調整財務行政組繳機構之决議，以適應戰時體制之需要。總之此次會議之結果，對於今後國府經濟施策之推行方針，已有具深信今後有關各部門曁全國上下，協力逼進，則國府之經濟建設大野，必可指日完成，而大東亞戰爭之勝利，亦决操左券。更可進而分祖大東亞共榮圈建設，及貢獻於世界繁榮。</p>

<p>本市中國經濟硏究會於去年冬間曾從事江浙兩省之農產物生產狀况調查，並已將其調查結果刊於該會最近出版之「中國經濟』第一卷第一期內。此次該會調查範圍曾擴及江浙兩省之沿太湖區·江南區·三角區。浙東區·蕭紹區。寧鎭區·江北區·蘇北區等地，所得材料頗為豐富，洵為關心農情者之極可貴文獻。茲將其所載各地農產狀况擇要刋登於下：</p>
<p>棉花下種以後，各地初期經過咸稱良好，惟長江以南各地，雨量過甚，雜草叢生，妨礙棉棵生長，情形稍差，八月上旬暴風突起時，適値棉花落花期間，花鈴吹落者甚夥，損失頗巨，尤以浙東區及三角區等重要棉產，損失最重。江北一帶及蘇北各地情形較佳，係因上述二地，風勢較弱，花期亦較他地為晚，此外，去年各地氣溫皆低，益以秋後雨量過甚，棉花收成遂受影響，兼以重要棉區（如餘姚，南匯等）因食糧缺乏，棉田有己改種食用作物省，浦東紹興等地尙有水災，棉田有被淹沒者，故估計去年棉產量比之前年將減少百分之二十五。</p>
<p>水稻初期經過亦屬滿意。江南一帶雖雨量梢多，然不足為害。但入夏以後，雨量則感不足，兼以大署時缺少大熱氣候與施肥不足，稻棵未能充分發育·秋後復以天氣陰凉，雨量缺乏，稻穗多莠而不實害虫乘機發生。例如長江以南各地皆有虫害報吿，江北一帶亦然，惟為况不如江南之甚·八月暴風，對於水稻之害，不若棉花之甚，其損害情形，因各地揚時花期不同，亦不一律。一般言之，除沿太湖區外，早稻收成較佳，晚稻則因揚花時適遭風災，損失較重。照以上情形估計，去年水稻產量比前年約減少百分之二。</p>
<p>甘薯等物，去年甘薯種植面積大增加，且雨量充足，生長經過良好，收穫甚為豐富。際此水稻歉收，食糧缺乏時，亦一好消息。前年黃豆收成甚好，去年則較差，幸成色尙較好。蘇北一帶雜糧收成皆稱良好，惟落花生因種植面積已不及往昔之多，收穫數量可與前年相等，祇惜成色不及前年耳</p>
<p>至於早經收割之各糧冬季作物，目前各地大致已出售完畢，其大槪情形如下：</p>
<p>小麥收獲量雖比前年增加，然上市數量則反不及之。其原因：　因食米缺乏兼價昂，如浙東蕭紹等缺米地區，大都以小麥代米·　江蘇南部各地，因麥價上漲不及其他各物，農戶不願低價出售　地方消費量增加，例如太湖區農民除將小麥用以代米及製醬外，有用於飼禽者。此係江南情形，至於蘇北小麥產區內，因　統制嚴密，　農需要現款迫切，　地方不靖，農戶不能存而不售等，出售數量則見增加。去年小麥登塲之初，農民多抱觀望態度，因之上市比往昔稍遲。小麥成色各地不同，江蘇南部因收割時多雨，成色較差，蘇北則否·</p>
<p>蠶豆去年蠶豆收成不及預想之佳，且因收割時下雨，成色非常惡劣。各地所產皆有虫蛀。據報吿，太湖一帶虫蛀者幾達百分之四十之多。蠶豆出售數量比前年減少，上市遲早各地不一。</p>
<p>菜籽收成不良，產地消費數量增加，上市數量不盟。自煤油來源吿斷之後，菜籽油除供食用之外，在鄕村尙作燈油之用，因之消費量大增。至於成色，因多雨故，殊為不佳。</p>

<p>白髪顏萬死餘　平生豪氣未全除</p>
<p>寶刀難染洋夷血却憶常陽舊草廬</p>
<p>這首詩讓中國人讀起來，是否有詩的意境，我雖然不敢妄加論斷，然而用日文讀起來，却是極富抑揚頓挫的名詩。詩的意思就是說：「現在自己業已白髮蒼顏了，以前曾常常出人於生死之間，平生的英雄氣慨，尙未完全消逝，而最足遺恨終身者，即自己所佩的寶刀，在未沾染洋夷血的時候，却想回到故鄕常陸的舊茅蘆去（與諸葛孔明正相反），作隱週生活了」。日本明治維新前的情緒，是這樣充滿着反對異族的「抗戰意織」。明治維新的革命指導者，利用這種「抗戰意織」，而先統一國內，統一剛剛完成，立刻就揚棄（Anfheben）了這種「抗戰意識」，而與外國締結正常邦交的條約。凡是看過明治維新史的人，都不能不欽佩和驚訝當時明洽維新指導者的作法。例如，像美國著名記者斯諾（EdgarSnow）這類人物，甚至談到明治維新這一經過時，也不能不油然而生出一種五體投地的敬服心理。他說：</p>
<p>「愈益認識這一期間明治大帝的當前困難，同時，愈益想到如此順利地打破數百年所形成的武士階級特權與勢力之政治革命及社會革命，則才越發相信，這一維新革命，只有由於異常出類拔萃的指導力，始能實現。歷史家異口同聲地承認，明治大帝在位的那一個世紀，恐怕大帝在許多點上，都是最偉大的人物。」（「遠東戰綫FarEasternFront」三十八頁）</p>
<p>現代中國的靑年，像寫信指問我的這位讀者一樣，對於國家民族的自由獨立，具有敏銳感覺，正如明洽維新時代的日本靑年一樣。假如凡辱及中國獨立的「洋夷」，必須加以痛快淋漓的打擊，正如明治維新時代的日本愛國志士一樣，那末日本現在的指導者，在中日問題上，則不能不再求深入地學習一下，巳往明治大帝的事蹟·假如日本尊重中國人的獨立自山情緒，而盡量援助中國，早日促其實現名實相符的眞正獨立自由狀態，那末中國的愛國靑年一定心悅誠服，願與日本駢　作戰，參加亞洲的解放鬥爭，這是我敢斷言的。反之，假如日本不尊重中國的民族自尊心，而想使中國的靑年，放棄盲目的民族敵愾心，簡直等於緣木求魚。於是就會使中日兩國的命還，走向乖戾蹉跎的道路。且中日兩國人民，由盲目的民族敵愾心，而釀成相互對立的時候，則「亞洲的命運」門戶，就不會開向光明。</p>
<p>孔子說過，「類無敎有」。按辜鴻銘的解釋，這就是說：「眞正有教育的人士間，是沒有人種商的差別的」。今日中日兩國最重要者，是中日雙方「眞正有敎育的人士」，結合起來而構成一種指導力量，　除民衆的民族敵愾心，使他們的誤解一一冰釋，　以動員民族解放的力量，而參加眞正的亞洲解放聖戰。伐柯如何匪斧不克娶妻如何匪媒不得（詩經）</p>

<p>在那個期商，眞人每逢星期的日子，常到圖書館去，閱讀鄕土的文獻。這明是受了河田校長的影響。校長，不但是愛讀歷史史的書籍，同時也是一個專鬥家，當時正在埋頭硏究鄕土著名。其對四　洲和薩英戰爭的　，是很著名的。</p>
<p>一諸君，必須要知道自己出身故鄉的歷史……」這是校長的口頭禪·時常對學生講述的。並且在校規裏面，也有這樣的一條。</p>
<p>眞人對於音樂，是門外漢，同時對文藝，也不感覺甚麼興趣，所以到圖書館去，也沒有借閱小說等的必要。小說的借閱者雖然根多，但是鄕土資料一類的東西，是隨時都可以借得到的。</p>
<p>這大他借來的書，是「薩英戰爭餘語」的明治時代出版的古本。發行所是鹿兒盜，者的氏名，也好像是鄕土出身者。用平明的文語　的，與其說　論，倒不如說是一部見聞錄。</p>
<p>——就是在成為引起戰爭原因的生麥事件時，日本方面也决沒有不法的舉動。奈良原喜左衛門斬决非禮的英人時，也只有李洽遜外兩名的男子，對於婦人都已放回。再英國方面提出所謂藩主久光公，曾由轎中嗾使兇犯的抗議等，這完全都是捏造的謊言，本來藩主聽到這事件的顧末時，只說了一句「是麼」？便輕輕地將放在身邊的東西移到左邊去。旣而聽到事件已結束之後，沉默的將　腰間的東西·移到右邊去了。</p>
<p>這一事件，倒激起了國內的大動搖，英國將中國艦隊，，派往橫濱，向幕府開始談判，要求在英國將校的面前，斬决犯人的首級，賠償一萬五千鎊的暗款·幕府當局頓呈恐慌之色，賠償損失金十萬鎊，以取媚於英人，但在薩摩方面，倒無所聞問，决不向幕府獻送犯人和償款，以發揚國家的威信。於是，英人惱恨薩摩的心理，因此越發地激昂起來了，文久三年六月二十二日，英國旗艦「猶利亞斯」號以下巨艦六艘，由橫濱出發，航行鹿兒島，企圖於威嚇之下，使薩麼藩屆伏。</p>
<p>但這威嚇行動，毫未奏效。祗因當時薩摩人士，對英人缺乏認識的緣故。當時盛傳英國鬼子沒有後踵，用棍棒一推便倒，自然一般人對英人，都要存一種輕侮之念的。有一個藩吏，曾於在到英國兵艦上的時候，看見一個英國軍官，留着長　，當上前一把抓住「可惡的長鬍子「拉着便走，使他進退不得。</p>
<p>再是像藩主久光公的身份，見到旗艦「猶利亞斯」的偉容，曾下毋須砲擊那白色軍艦的命令　不問他理由如何·在久光公的意思，好像是想鹵獲那隻白軍艦·俾作將來到江戶述職時使用似的。這彷彿就是在開戰以前，精神上已經戰勝敵人了。（二）（十）（六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Weekly Commentary: Teaching Without Teaching – Yoshida Tosuke <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, I published an article titled "On Love" in this newspaper. Although I stated in that article that Japan "treats" China "as equals," Chinese intellectuals still do not believe that Japanese truly treat China as equals. This is the key focus of the Sino-Japanese problem. I have said that if Japan can dispel this doubt among the Chinese and truly demonstrate an equal spirit towards China in practical life, then the Chinese will wholeheartedly assist Japan at any time. I even used the relationship as a metaphor for love between a man and a woman: if a man wants to win a woman's heart, he should not just speak sweet words, but more importantly, he must reveal genuine feelings in the trivial matters of daily life. Unexpectedly, such an article provoked a reader to send a letter filled with thorough accusations. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>"Mr. Yoshida Tosuke: Your essay truly moved me. You are truly a Japanese who sympathizes with China. Every time the newspaper arrives, as long as I discover an article by you, I must calmly and patiently read it. Recently, reading the section on "Talking About Love" made me weep and shed tears. However, upon reading the last section, I actually cursed you. You are ultimately not a China expert, because China has always valued men over women, and you actually compare our dignified China to a woman. I will never forget this insult to us. Have you read our "Romance of the Three Kingdoms"? Kongming sent women's clothing to Sima Yi, and today you are sending women's names to the Chinese, which is surprisingly similar. In the future, when publishing articles, you should pay attention again and again, otherwise I will curse you.</p>
<p>"I used to think that your articles published in the *Shen Bao* were translated from Japanese newspapers and magazines. Now I understand that your articles cannot make money in Japanese newspapers and magazines and are only published in the Chinese newspaper. This is clearly catering to the tastes of the Chinese people, creating an opportunistic writer. How shameful! In the future, I hope you will publish your articles in Japanese newspapers and magazines first. I have several questions that are good material for you to write about. Please study them..." (Many questions raised by this reader in the letter were all text that could not be published here, so they had to be deleted).</p>
<p>This reader's special concern for my article is something I am grateful for. As for the criticism and accusations against me, it is not as if there is nothing to respond to. First, although this reader claims to be Chinese, her observation of the current social situation in China seems insufficient. Because among Chinese intellectuals, gender equality is no longer an issue. New figures today do not believe that the social status of Chinese women is lower than that of men. To take an extreme example, look at Soong Mei-ling in Chongqing. Which man does not bow his head and admit defeat in front of her? Didn't Bai Juyi say? "Sisters and brothers are all enfeoffed with land, pity that glory arises from humble households, thus causing all parents in the world to not value the birth of sons but value the birth of daughters." Look, Soong Mei-ling has such great power. Within the Peace District, it is not absolutely impossible to find similar phenomena. In short, a female view like that of the reader is extremely rare among progressive Chinese people today. Moreover, I advocate that Sino-Japanese relations must be like a proper love affair between equal men and women. Therefore, this reader's criticism of me is completely off the mark.</p>
<p>Second, I do not publish in Japanese but specialize in writing articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese in the Chinese newspaper, so this reader recognizes me as an opportunistic writer. Only on this point has the reader spoken correctly. Of course, if I publish articles in Chinese, I cannot help but cater to the tastes of the Chinese. If I write pages and pages of propaganda that the Chinese are not interested in at all and simply cannot accept, then I would consider it a waste of paper. Today, when we are constantly advocating "the principle of thrift," I believe that such propaganda "principles" should be "thrifty" first. However, it is a pity that most of the publications in Shanghai today are filled with these kinds of similar articles. If it is believed that I "seize" such an "opportunity" and write articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese, and that this is a so-called "opportunistic writer," then please forgive me for impolitely accepting this "complimentary term." Furthermore, if it is said that my articles are flowery words that deceive the Chinese, then the reader should point out which part of my article is deceptive. I have always welcomed others to point out my faults. Writing articles that Chinese people like to read is considered a shameful opportunistic writer, which does not seem very logical. Moreover, I am definitely not someone who specializes in writing articles that cater to the tastes of the Chinese. In fact, it might be more accurate to say that I write more words of scolding. In addition, the reason for not publishing in Japanese has already been discussed elsewhere, so I will not repeat it. (Please refer to Yoshida Tosuke's "Reply to a Reader" on page four of this newspaper on December 28 of last year - Editor's Note)</p>
<p>This reader's mind cannot distinguish between right and wrong even for such a simple theory, so some people may think that this reader's mind is not sharp and has innate defects. Then, perhaps the author's tireless response to such a naive reader may be seen as casting pearls before swine! However, the author believes that there is a significant meaning in the naivety and fallacies of a reader expressed in this letter. This is the reader's state of mind, just like the state of mind that Japanese patriots had during the Meiji Restoration, filled with national self-esteem. When encountering someone who seems to harm this national self-esteem, they immediately become angry and indignant, and they can no longer control themselves with a calm mind. Therefore, when this reader saw me compare China to a woman, she immediately became furious regardless of the main purpose of the article. As for this reader's other misunderstandings of me, they are all due to this national self-esteem. However, this kind of thinking can be said to be a common tendency among young Chinese people today. Let's think back for a moment. During the Meiji Restoration era, we Japanese youths also held unlimited national animosity towards the so-called "Western barbarians" who were thought to threaten Japan's freedom and independence. At that time, the most respected scholar and poet among Japanese youth was Fujita Toko of Changyo (Hitachi). The Chinese poems he wrote were the most popular songs among the youth of the Restoration era. One of these poems is as follows: (The following turns to page four).</p>

<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today: On the morning of the 14th, the Japanese naval air force intercepted approximately 160 enemy planes attacking Rabaul and shot down 65 of them (including 18 unconfirmed). The Japanese side lost 3 planes. On the night of January 13th until the morning of the 14th, the Japanese naval air force attacked enemy airfields and military supply warehouses in Toro and Munda of Kieta, causing major fires in three locations in Toro and ten locations in Munda. No Japanese planes returned from this operation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): A certain Japanese military base in the Southwest Pacific reported on the 15th: After 80 enemy planes attacked Rabaul on the 12th, another combined force of 100 fighter-bombers, including Vought F4U Corsairs, Grumman F6F Hellcats, Bell P-39 Airacobras, and 12 Douglas B-26 Marauder bombers, totaling 162 planes, launched a major attack on Rabaul on the morning of the 14th. At that time, the Japanese naval fighters immediately engaged in fierce aerial combat with the enemy planes. According to the results announced by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 15th, 65 of them were shot down (including 18 unconfirmed), including 36 Vought F4U Corsairs (including 11 unconfirmed), 11 Grumman F6F Hellcats (including 2 unconfirmed), 17 Grumman fighters (including 5 unconfirmed), and 1 Douglas B-26 Marauder, with a downing ratio of over 40%. Since the beginning of this year, a total of 828 enemy planes have attacked Rabaul, and the Japanese naval air force has shot down a quarter of them, totaling 211 planes. In this operation, 3 Japanese planes did not return. According to statistics, the total number of Japanese planes that self-detonated and did not return since the beginning of this year is 18, compared to the enemy's loss of 211 planes, the loss ratio is 8.5%, which is enough to show the invincible spirit of the Japanese naval air force.</p>
<p>US Troops on the Aroae Peninsula are in Imminent Danger</p>
<p>Argentina, Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): The situation in the Aroae area of ​​New Britain Island in the Pacific has recently become more intense. It is reported that the Aroae Peninsula, which is firmly defended by the US troops in that area, is in imminent danger due to the continuous attacks by the Japanese army. According to a report by the Associated Press from a certain US base in the Southwest Pacific on the 14th: It is reported that a spokesman for the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Command, who returned from the front line command of the Aroae Peninsula this week, said that the Japanese army had attacked the Aroae Peninsula and the positions occupied by the US troops several times. The US 6th Army troops in that area are still firmly defending the small area near the peninsula's islands and inland areas, and the Japanese and US troops are currently facing each other about 100 miles apart.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency): A certain Japanese base in the Central Pacific reported: The Japanese naval air force's attacks on the Gilbert Islands have recently become increasingly fierce. At the same time, enemy planes also occasionally launched small-scale counterattacks on the Marshall Islands, resulting in an increasingly active decisive battle between the Japanese and US air forces in that area. The Japanese naval air force twice bombed Tarawa Island in the Gilbert Islands on the morning of the 12th, fiercely bombing the enemy airfield and military facilities, causing one hit and two fires. All Japanese planes returned to base. On the same afternoon, the enemy also attacked Tarowa on Maloelap Atoll in the Marshall Islands with nine E24 aircraft. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, destroying one. In addition, 40 enemy planes, including 30 dive bombers and 10 P-34 aircraft, continued to attack Miller Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 13th, and one was shot down by the Japanese garrison's anti-aircraft fire.</p>
<h3 id="e3">National Ordnance Conference Successfully Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency): Yesterday, the 15th, was the third day of the first National Ordnance Conference. At 9:00 AM, Army Minister Ye Peng gave a lecture on "Ordnance Talks," elaborating in detail on the evolution of primitive weapons to the rapid development of modern weapons, which lasted for more than an hour. At 1:40 PM, the third meeting was held to review the proposals that had been reviewed by the various groups. Starting at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Gao Sen gave a lecture.

<h3 id="e7">Consumption Special Tax to be Levied Today – Minister Zhou Releases Statement – Original Retail Donations and Other Items All Stopped <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency, Central News Agency: The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, under orders to implement the wartime consumption special tax, has designated fifteen important cities and counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, to first levy the first item of retail goods, and the second item of banquets and hotels, two types of consumption special taxes, starting from today (the 16th). Within Shanghai Special Municipality's Districts 1 and 8, the special tax to be levied will be collected on behalf of the municipal government's Finance Departments of Districts 1 and 8. In other districts, cities, and counties, it will be handled by the various taxation sub-bureaus under the Taxation Department. From the date of implementation, all original local retail goods donations, banquet donations, and hotel donations collected in the areas where the consumption special tax is levied will be stopped. Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance and Shao, the head of the Taxation Department, especially released statements regarding the consumption special tax. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Consumption Special Tax Items</p>
<p>The department's consumption special tax is divided into three items: retail goods, banquets and hotels, and entertainment. The first item, the retail special tax on goods, is specified as follows: Gold, silver, jewelry, diamonds, ivory, etc., and their finished products. Antiques and curios. Embroidery, carpets. Valuable furs (such as sable, sea otter, lynx, etc.) and their finished products. Musical instruments, record players, records, cameras, films, and their accessories and parts. Dominoes, mahjong tiles, playing cards, flower cards, dice, etc. Other than luxury goods, the rest are ordinary goods. The second item, the special tax on banquets and hotels, is levied on behalf of those who open hotels, apartments, tea rooms, cafes, restaurants, and other similar places for people to eat and stay. The following items may be removed from each bill collected: Laundry fees. Service gratuities. Electricity bills. Other expenses paid on behalf of others, and then the tax is calculated. The third item, the entertainment special tax, is divided into (A) movies, horse racing, music, ice skating, swimming, etc. (B) dramas, singing, storytelling, performances, etc. (C) other luxury entertainment such as dancing.</p>
<p>Levying Consumption Special Tax</p>
<p>The various goods that should be exempted from the retail consumption special tax include: Those that have already paid the special consumption tax on banquets and hotels. Newspapers. Textbooks used in schools. Rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains and their ground flour, dried noodles, raw noodles, pancakes, fried dough sticks, bread, steamed buns, edible sugar, edible salt, soy sauce, vinegar, edible oil, vegetables. Coal, coal balls, charcoal, firewood, and various firewood grasses, gas, electricity, heat, water ice. Those who only collect labor fees and do not engage in the sale of goods for profit. Other goods designated by government order to be exempted.</p>
<p>Minister Zhou's Statement</p>
<p>Minister Zhou Fohai of the Ministry of Finance released a statement saying: "The national budget was originally based on measuring expenditure to determine income. Moreover, during wartime, all countries are heavily increasing taxes to stabilize the financial foundation. Since our country's participation in the war, all expenditures have been enormous. Since expenditures are large, it is inevitable to increase income in order to balance revenue and expenditure. This is a matter of course, so taxes must be increased. However, increasing taxes will increase the burden on the people. National finances are in difficulty, and of course the people need to assist, but at the same time, the people's economic capacity must also be taken into account. How can we make it easier for the people to bear the burden? Therefore, the central government, after repeated consideration, decided to implement a special consumption tax and entrusted it to the Taxation Department of this Ministry to manage. Therefore, there are several reasons for implementing these special consumption taxes: Most places have already implemented these types of donations and taxes, and the people are already accustomed to paying taxes. It is directly taken from consumers, not from business merchants, so that business merchants cannot take this opportunity to increase taxes and raise prices. People with greater consumption power will pay more taxes. People with less consumption power will pay less taxes, and the burden is very fair. In very special times, everything should be frugal, and unnecessary consumption should be saved. These special consumption taxes have the effect of limiting consumption and promoting frugality. There are these various reasons inside, so I think that handling these special consumption taxes is still considered the most appropriate. As for the regulations on the tax rates of each tax, various considerations have also been made. First, we must take into account the economic capacity of the general public, and second, we must have the effect of promoting frugality, indirectly preventing the people's economy from being wasteful. Based on these two major principles, the tax rates for each tax were determined. Therefore, the entertainment consumption special tax rate is the highest, and among the entertainment taxes, the tax rate for luxury entertainment is even higher. And the tax rate for retail tax on ordinary goods is the lowest. Among ordinary goods, such as rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, coal balls, firewood, etc., are all tax-exempt. The government handles things so carefully, and I very much hope that the people can all understand and cooperate with the government. I especially hope that various business merchants will prioritize national tax revenue and not eat one's own private interests by falsely raising prices. If found, the government will severely punish them. They should abide by the various regulations and sincerely handle the matter so that for every penny of tax paid by consumers, the national treasury will receive one more income. This is what I most hope for," and so on.</p>
<p>Director's Statement</p>
<p>Shao, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, released the following statement regarding the collection of the consumption special tax: "Our country's tax law has always been a kind of indirect tax system that is taken from businesses and passed on to the people. It is difficult to popularize tax collection, and the methods are also incomplete. Based on past situations, indirect taxes easily stimulate prices to rise, and it is difficult to balance commodity profits and loan interest. This time, our department was ordered to levy three types of consumption special taxes: retail goods, banquets, hotels, and entertainment. This is a direct tax directly levied on consumers, which does not increase the burden on merchants and has absolutely no relationship with commerce. According to this method, in many European and Asian countries at war today, due to the needs of the war, materials are conserved, and direct tax methods are adopted to make everyone have a tax obligation and share the difficulties of national affairs. The central government, in view of this, resolutely created it and first directly collected it from the people in major cities by our department's supervision and ordered subordinates, gradually reaching other places, without being transferred from businesses to the people again. One is to ban the consumption of goods, which can conserve materials; the other is to reduce consumption power, which can help increase production, and can avoid the malady of stimulating price increases. This is of great importance to the prosperity of the national fortune, and I hope that the people will understand the nature of indirect and direct taxes and work together to overcome the difficulties of the times. Also, do not raise prices and affect people's livelihoods. Because the government has been discussing the collection of this consumption special tax for a long time, taking into account the burden on the people. For example, daily necessities must be exempt from tax collection because they are related to the people's livelihood, and luxury goods that have nothing to do with the people's livelihood must be heavily taxed, etc. All considerations will be made before implementation. The consumption special tax rates are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Tax-Exempt Categories: Daily necessities, such as rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, coal, firewood, various firewood grasses, gas, electricity, heat, water ice, as well as newspapers, schools, etc., which are closely related to people's livelihoods, are all exempt from the consumption special tax.</p>
<p>The prescribed tax rate for various ordinary goods is 4% ad valorem. Luxury goods such as gold, silver, jewelry, diamonds, ivory, etc., finished products, antiques, curios, embroidered curtains, carpets, valuable furs such as sable and lynx, musical instruments, record players, films, cameras, and their attached island parts, as well as dominoes, etc., are all unrelated to people's livelihoods and are subject to a uniform tax of % ad valorem.</p>
<p>Banquets and hotels are close to extravagant consumption, so the tax rate is tentatively set at 15% ad valorem. As for the entertainment consumption tax rate, it has also been divided into light and heavy, and it has been prescribed to be from 10% to 40%. The specific date of collection will be announced later. The above points are all the major ones, and I hope that shops and direct consumers in various places will share the difficulties of the times, conserve materials, work hard to produce, and actively transport and contribute, which is what I deeply hope for."</p>

<p>Chairman's Personal Address Read by Vice Chairman Zhou</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - At the third plenary session of the National Economic Council on the 15th, the Chairman, suffering from a cold and fever, was represented by Vice Chairman Zhou, who also read a brief address personally written by the Chairman. The full text of the address is respectfully recorded below:</p>
<p>Today, at the meeting of the National Economic Council, I am unfortunately suffering from a cold and fever. Therefore, I have entrusted Vice Chairman Zhou to preside on my behalf and deliver a brief address as follows: This year's economic construction places emphasis on increasing production. The budget for the first half of the year, which was passed the other day, also places emphasis on this. The so-called increase in production prioritizes increasing grain production and increasing cotton production. In addition to agriculture, we must also pay attention to light industry, such as the yarn, cloth, and flour industries. I deeply hope that all of you will work together to accomplish this task. Furthermore, it should be said that rectifying thought, ensuring public security, and increasing production are all interconnected. The government should focus its efforts on protecting producers, ensuring that producers can enjoy the fruits of their production. External disturbances, such as the Communist bandits' looting, and internal exploitation, such as the embezzlement of unscrupulous officials and the extortion of rogue soldiers, must be strictly prohibited. In society, the meaning of increasing production should be thoroughly understood. The so-called increase in production, on the one hand, strengthens our productivity, and on the other hand, makes us even more powerful to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Both are advancing simultaneously. The prosperity of China and the preservation of Asia depend on this. I am willing to encourage each other with all of you. January 15th, Wang Zhaoming.</p>
<p>The National Government Establishes and Promotes Economic Policies</p>
<p>Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) - The third plenary session of the National Economic Council concluded successfully in Nanjing on the 15th. Thanks to the sincere enthusiasm and harmonious agreement of all the attending members, all fourteen important proposals concerning increasing production were reviewed carefully and passed smoothly. Therefore, the achievements of this session are indeed greater than those of previous sessions. The first and second sessions only established the National Government's wartime economic policies and formulated concrete economic construction plans. Now, the objective environment of the third session is completely different from that of the previous two sessions. This year is the decisive year for the Greater East Asia War. In order to achieve the final victory, all manpower and material resources have been continuously mobilized. Therefore, the important mission of this session is to provide solutions to this important issue and to present a concrete implementation plan for increasing production. As a result of this meeting, various concrete plans have been decided upon for this important issue. Looking at all the resolutions passed this time, there are measures such as the plan to regulate rural finance, the plan to revitalize industry, the establishment of state-owned farms, the establishment of a general association for industrial revitalization, measures to alleviate the fuel crisis, the restoration of electricity needed by various manufacturers, and the promotion of salt and agricultural work in the Huainan area, all of which are important issues for promoting production increase work at present. As for those concerning the reform of the currency system, there is a resolution to announce the post-war currency system reform policy as soon as possible to stabilize public sentiment. As for those concerning increasing national tax revenue and absorbing idle funds, there are resolutions to increase the real estate tax and to have the operation of real estate companies supervised by the government. As for regulating the people's diet and saving consumers, there are resolutions on the outline of measures for the collection and distribution of food and on the thrift campaign. In addition, there is also a resolution to adjust the organizational structure of financial administration to adapt to the needs of the wartime system. In short, as a result of this meeting, a concrete direction for the promotion of the National Government's economic policies in the future has been established. It is deeply believed that if the relevant departments and the entire nation work together to advance, the National Government's grand blueprint for economic construction will surely be completed in the near future, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War will definitely be in our hands. Furthermore, we can proceed to contribute to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and to the prosperity of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Soviet Offensive Stalled Near Sarny <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitong News Agency, the German military situation department stated: In the past twenty-four hours, there has been little change in the situation on the Eastern Front. The intensity of the fighting on the entire front has decreased slightly. Although the Soviet army has continued to attack, it is not as strong as it was a week ago. West of Zhytomyr, the Soviet advance was weakened before reaching the German defense line. West of Sarny, the Soviet army continued to advance westward, but the situation is not too difficult because there are not many Soviet troops there. Once they encounter a large German force, they will inevitably retreat quickly. On Thursday, the Soviet army in the Nikopol area expanded its territory, but its attack on German strongholds did not achieve the desired success. West of Kirovograd, the Soviet army attacked several times. After a counterattack, the German army filled in one gap. German positions southwest of Cherkasy were breached in several places. The German army slightly retreated near Rechitsa. The situation near Vitebsk has not changed. Northwest of Nevel, after the Soviet attack, the positions remained unchanged. In the past two days, the Soviet army lost 335 tanks.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a London report, the European Advisory Commission, which was decided to be established at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, held its first formal meeting yesterday, with U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom Winant serving as chairman. The task of the commission is to study various issues arising from the war situation and to submit recommendations to the governments of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Survey Report on the Agricultural Situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces by the China Economic Research Association <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The China Economic Research Association in this city conducted a survey of the agricultural production situation in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last winter and has published the results in the first issue of the first volume of "China Economics," which was recently published by the association. This time, the association's survey covered the Taihu Lake region, the Jiangnan region, the Delta region, the Zhejiang East region, the Xiao-Shao region, the Ningzhen region, the Jiangbei region, the Subei region, and other places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The materials obtained were quite rich and are truly a valuable document for those who care about agriculture. The following is a selection of the agricultural conditions in various places as recorded:</p>
<p>After the cotton was sown, the initial progress in various places was said to be good. However, in the areas south of the Yangtze River, excessive rainfall and the growth of weeds hindered the growth of cotton plants, and the situation was slightly worse. When a storm suddenly occurred in early August, it coincided with the cotton flower shedding period, and many of the flowers and bolls were blown off, resulting in significant losses, especially in the important cotton-producing areas such as the Zhejiang East region and the Delta region. The situation in Jiangbei and Subei was better because the wind was weaker in these two places and the flowering period was later than in other places. In addition, the temperatures in various places were low last year, and the excessive rainfall after autumn affected the cotton harvest. Moreover, in important cotton-producing areas (such as Yuyao and Nanhui), cotton fields were converted to growing edible crops due to food shortages. There were also floods in Pudong, Shaoxing, and other places, and some cotton fields were flooded. Therefore, it is estimated that last year's cotton production will decrease by 25% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The initial progress of rice was also satisfactory. Although there was slightly more rainfall in the Jiangnan area, it was not harmful. However, after entering summer, the rainfall was insufficient, and the lack of hot weather during the hottest period and insufficient fertilization prevented the rice plants from developing fully. After autumn, the weather was cool and rainy, and the rice ears were mostly barren and unproductive. Pests took the opportunity to occur. For example, pest reports were received from all areas south of the Yangtze River, as well as from Jiangbei, but the situation was not as severe as in Jiangnan. The storm in August was not as harmful to rice as it was to cotton. The extent of the damage varied depending on the different flowering periods in various places. Generally speaking, except for the Taihu Lake area, the early rice harvest was better, while the late rice suffered greater losses due to the wind disaster during the flowering period. Based on the above situation, it is estimated that last year's rice production decreased by about 2% compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>As for sweet potatoes and other crops, the planting area of sweet potatoes increased greatly last year, and the rainfall was sufficient, the growth was good, and the harvest was very abundant. This is also good news at a time when rice harvests are poor and food is scarce. The soybean harvest was very good the year before, but it was worse last year. Fortunately, the quality was still better. The harvests of miscellaneous grains in the Subei area were all said to be good, but the planting area of peanuts was not as large as in the past, and the quantity harvested was comparable to the previous year, but the quality was not as good as the previous year.</p>
<p>As for the various winter crops that have been harvested early, they have generally been sold out in various places, and the general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Although the wheat harvest was higher than the previous year, the quantity on the market was lower. The reasons: Because of the lack of rice and high prices, wheat was mostly used to replace rice in rice-deficient areas such as Xiao-Shao in Zhejiang East. In various parts of southern Jiangsu, wheat prices did not rise as much as other commodities, and farmers were unwilling to sell at low prices. Local consumption increased. For example, farmers in the Taihu Lake area used wheat to replace rice and make soy sauce, and some even used it to feed poultry. This is the situation in Jiangnan. As for the wheat-producing areas in Subei, the quantity sold increased because the control was strict, the farmers urgently needed cash, and the local area was unstable, so the farmers could not store the wheat and sell it later. At the beginning of the wheat harvest last year, farmers mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so the market was slightly later than in the past. The quality of wheat varies from place to place. In southern Jiangsu, the quality was poor due to the rain during harvest, while in Subei it was not.</p>
<p>Last year's broad bean harvest was not as good as expected, and the quality was very poor due to the rain during harvest. There were insects in the produce in various places. According to reports, nearly 40% of the broad beans in the Taihu Lake area were infested with insects. The quantity of broad beans sold was lower than the previous year, and the timing of the market varied from place to place.</p>
<p>The rapeseed harvest was poor, local consumption increased, and the quantity on the market was not allied. Since the source of kerosene has been cut off, rapeseed oil is used as lamp oil in the countryside in addition to being used for food, so consumption has increased greatly. As for the quality, it was very poor due to the rain.</p>

Even during normal operating hours, Route 1 and Route 2 trams can turn around and return at this terminus without having to continue to the terminus at the eastern end of the Bund in Hongkou.</p>

<p>First District Municipal Elementary and Middle School Joint Graduation Ceremony - This Newspaper Awarded Silver Cup for Scholarship</p>
<p>The municipal elementary and middle schools of the First District held a joint graduation ceremony at the Grand Theatre yesterday (15th) at 10:00 AM. Mayor Chen attended in person to give instructions, and the event was unprecedentedly grand. Deputy Director Su Chengde of the First Police Bureau, Director Lin Jiong'an of the First District Education Office, Deputy Director Tan Tiankai, Ueno Taichu, and principals and parents of the elementary and middle schools, totaling over 1,000 people, attended. After the meeting began and formalities were observed, Chairman Lin delivered the opening remarks.</p>
<p>Mayor Chen's Speech - Mayor Chen's instructions stated: The level of education in our country is lower than that of some advanced countries, so elementary school graduates are already rare in Chinese society, and middle school graduates are even rarer. Therefore, I hope that all of you will work harder in the future, whether you continue your studies or seek employment, to live up to the expectations of the country and society. Mayor Chen also pointed out that "knowledge," "thought," and "action" are the greatest principles for young people to strive for, which is the same as the unity of knowledge and action advocated by the sage Wang Yangming. He hopes that young people will firmly grasp these three words and strive forward. Following this, student representatives delivered farewell speeches, and the graduates delivered reply speeches. Mayor Chen presented graduation certificates, and Deputy Director Ueno Taichu presented awards. This newspaper was awarded.</p>
<p>This newspaper and the News Daily have consistently managed scholarships well, and the First District Government, led by Director Chen concurrently, each presented a commemorative silver cup, engraved with "Benefiting Students," which was awarded at yesterday's graduation ceremony. Finally, Deputy Director Tan Tiankai delivered the closing remarks, and the ceremony concluded with music.</p>
<p>Won't Be Interrupted Even During Lockdown</p>
<p>Furthermore, even if the barricades at the Nanjing Road intersection are closed, trams operating in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou Creek will not be interrupted. For example, route 12 can go directly to the southeastern end of the Bund and then turn back to Hongkou and Yangshupu. Reporters often mention that if route 1 and 2 cars turn around at the new terminus, the number of cars heading to Hongkou and the southeastern end of the Bund may be reduced. Officials in charge said that other routes, such as route 8, 10, 11, and 12, can increase the number of cars to offset this inconvenience. Also, if traffic on the Suzhou Creek is interrupted because there is no extra space in front of the Waibaidu Bridge and Broadway Mansions to set up a new terminus, cars running in that area can turn around on the original track. At the same time, Huazhong Urban Bus Company has merged with Shanghai Tram Company, and recently the Bureau has allocated a large quantity of heavy-duty diesel to operate its internal combustion buses. Currently, ten vehicles use this diesel, and seventeen are reserved for emergencies.</p>

<p>An official in charge of the Rice Rationing Committee told reporters yesterday that, as a result of overall planning, the committee has shipped more than 300,000 shi of white rice to Shanghai for the supply of household rice in the city. All of the rice has been allocated to the Shanghai Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee for uniform rationing beginning on the 12th of this month. However, according to the committee's advisor Yoshikawa and Deputy Secretary-General Yang Shouzhang, who attended the meeting of the Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee yesterday, they learned that because the Grain Adjustment and Rationing Committee had previously stored brown rice, the brown rice would be distributed first in the current period (the second period, which began on the 12th of this month). For the next period (the third period), the committee will distribute the Rice Rationing Committee's white rice. At that time, if citizens find that the household rice is mixed with red brown rice or gravel, they are encouraged to report it to the Rice Rationing Committee.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of food rationing, it has not been possible to purchase brown sugar.

It is now learned that the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Office, to care for mothers-to-be, will sell an appropriate amount of brown sugar to those who are indeed more than nine months pregnant and have a certificate from the Baojia chief. However, because the stock of brown sugar is not abundant, the office will decide whether to approve the application and the amount to be sold.</p>

According to the office, workers who behave properly will be protected in their jobs, and those who are found to be disruptive will be reported to the police authorities for punishment. The "Shanghai Special City Management Travel Agency Registration Method" has been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau for travel agency registration, so that the sale of black market ship tickets will be strictly prohibited in the future.</p>

<p>White hair, face ten thousand deaths remaining,</p>
<p>My whole life's heroism is not yet completely gone.</p>
<p>It is difficult for a treasured sword to be stained with foreign barbarians' blood,</p>
<p>But I recall my old thatched cottage in Hitachi Province.</p>
<p>Does this poem evoke poetic imagery for Chinese readers? I dare not presume to judge. However, when read in Japanese, it is an extremely rhythmic and moving poem. The poem means: "Now I am already old with white hair. In the past, I often walked between life and death. The heroic spirit of my life has not completely disappeared. But what I regret most in my life is that my treasured sword has not been stained with the blood of foreign barbarians, and I want to return to my old thatched cottage in Hitachi Province (the opposite of Zhuge Kongming), and live a life of seclusion." The emotions before the Meiji Restoration in Japan were filled with this kind of "anti-war consciousness" against foreigners. The revolutionary leaders of the Meiji Restoration used this "anti-war consciousness" to first unify the country. As soon as the unification was completed, they immediately abandoned (Aufheben) this "anti-war consciousness" and concluded treaties of normal diplomatic relations with foreign countries. Anyone who has read the history of the Meiji Restoration cannot but admire and be amazed by the actions of the Meiji Restoration leaders at that time. For example, even figures like the famous American journalist Edgar Snow could not help but feel a sense of utter admiration when talking about the Meiji Restoration. He said:</p>
<p>"The more I recognize the current difficulties of Emperor Meiji during this period, and the more I think about the political and social revolutions that so smoothly broke the privileges and power of the samurai class formed over hundreds of years, the more I believe that this restoration revolution could only be achieved with extraordinary and outstanding leadership. Historians unanimously acknowledge that Emperor Meiji was probably the greatest figure in many respects in the century in which he reigned." ("Far Eastern Front," page 38)</p>
<p>Modern Chinese youth, like the reader who wrote to me, have a keen sense of national independence, just like the Japanese youth in the Meiji Restoration era. If any "foreign barbarians" who insult China's independence must be dealt with thoroughly, just like the Japanese patriotic patriots of the Meiji Restoration era, then Japan's current leaders must study the deeds of Emperor Meiji in the past in more depth on the issue of China. If Japan respects the Chinese people's desire for independence and freedom, and does its best to help China achieve a truly independent and free state that matches its name and reality as soon as possible, then the patriotic youth of China will certainly be convinced and willingly fight alongside Japan to participate in the liberation struggle of Asia. This is what I dare to assert. On the other hand, if Japan does not respect the national self-esteem of the Chinese people, and wants to make the Chinese youth abandon their blind national animosity, it is simply like climbing a tree to catch a fish. This will lead the destiny of China and Japan down a wrong and tortuous path. When the people of China and Japan are brought into mutual opposition by blind national animosity, the gateway to the "destiny of Asia" will not open to the light.</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Teach without discrimination." According to Gu Hongming's interpretation, this means: "There is no difference in race among truly educated people." The most important thing for China and Japan today is for the "truly educated people" of both China and Japan to unite and form a guiding force, to eliminate the national animosity of the masses, to dispel their misunderstandings one by one, and to mobilize the power of national liberation to participate in the true holy war for the liberation of Asia.

<p>During that period of commerce, Masato always went to the library on Sundays to read local literature. This was clearly influenced by Principal Kawada. The principal not only loved reading historical books but was also a dedicated researcher, currently immersed in studying local celebrities. His views on the Four Continents and the Satsuma-British War were quite famous.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, you must know the history of your hometown…" This was the principal's mantra, frequently told to students. Moreover, this was also a part of the school rules.</p>
<p>Masato was a layman when it came to music, and he didn't feel much interest in literature either, so there was no need for him to borrow novels or the like from the library. Although there were many borrowers of novels, local materials could always be borrowed.</p>
<p>The book he borrowed was an old edition of "Aftermath of the Satsuma-British War" published during the Meiji era. The publisher was Kagoshima, and the author's name seemed to be from the local area as well. Written in plain vernacular, it was more of a record of observations than a treatise.</p>
<p>——That is, during the Namamugi Incident, which became the cause of the war, the Japanese side did not take any illegal actions. When Narahara Kizaemon beheaded the impolite Englishman, there were only two other men besides Richardson; the women had already been released. Furthermore, the British side's protest that the so-called Lord Hisamitsu had instigated the crime from his palanquin was a complete fabrication and lie. Originally, when the lord heard about the incident, he only said "Is that so?" and casually moved the object beside him to the left. After hearing that the incident was over, he silently moved the object from his waist to the right.</p>
<p>This incident stirred up great turmoil within the country. The British sent their Chinese fleet to Yokohama and began negotiations with the shogunate, demanding that the criminals' heads be cut off in front of British officers and demanding compensation of 150,000 pounds. The shogunate authorities panicked and paid 100,000 pounds in compensation to appease the British. However, Satsuma made no inquiries and refused to send the criminals or compensation to the shogunate, in order to promote the country's prestige. Therefore, the British's resentment towards Satsuma intensified. On June 22nd of the third year of Bunkyu (1863), six British warships, led by the flagship "Euryalus," departed from Yokohama and sailed to Kagoshima, attempting to subdue the Satsuma domain under threat.</p>
<p>However, this intimidation tactic was completely ineffective. This was only because the people of Satsuma at the time lacked knowledge of the British. At the time, it was widely rumored that British devils had no heels and would fall over if pushed with a stick. Naturally, the general public held the British in contempt. A domain official, upon seeing a British military officer with a long beard while on board a British warship, went forward and grabbed the "despicable long beard," pulling him along, rendering him unable to move.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as for the position of Lord Hisamitsu, upon seeing the grandeur of the flagship "Euryalus," he issued an order not to fire on the white warship. Regardless of his reasons, it seemed that Hisamitsu wanted to seize that white warship for use when reporting for duty in Edo in the future. It was as if they had already mentally defeated the enemy before the start of the war. (2)(10)(6)</p>
<h3 id="e35">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>I was deeply moved by the article "Promoting the Use of Local Yarn" by Mr. Zhu Shuxun in the National Forum on the 11th. I work in a dyeing and weaving factory and am currently facing a shortage of raw materials, feeling as if there is nothing I can do. The author's suggestion is like a beacon in the night. However, I wonder about the quality of this local yarn? If new types of local yarn can be improved (each person manages 60 spindles and produces 7 pounds of yarn per day), it would be very suitable for weaving fabrics similar to 16-pound cloth locally. I hope you can provide more details, and if possible, conduct an on-site investigation.</p>
