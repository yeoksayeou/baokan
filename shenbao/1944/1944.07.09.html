<p>星期評論</p>
<h3>「小題大作」</h3>
<p>— 吉田東祐</p>
<p>我不久前曾碰到過這樣一件事情。我住的公寓，是日本某大國策公司管理着的，最近因節省電力，而大加縮短電梯的使用時間·因此，俞此僱用着的三位電梯司機，就辭退了兩位。但服務三年以上的司機遣散費，僅僅爲一月薪俸的三分之二。按前例，這一公寓的遣散費，會定爲兩個月薪修，然新管理者國策公司，竟不顧慣例，而付解僱者以三分之一的一月薪俸，常司機與之交涉，則主管人盤色俱厲，斥言「滾蛋，」尤有甚者，該公司特派的日本監督，竟兩度賞以老拳，此種無法無天的現象，眞可以說無以復如。敢請這位日本人，夜深人靜，捫心自問，日本人對終日木人是否能有這類野變行動？日本人對於中國人竟有這樣凶惡態度，共原因不外是由於日本人存有一種錯誤觀念，認爲對方既是中國人，就可以任意加以無埋。西太后會慨嘆過：「他們（歐美人）只因認爲我們只是中國人，而就看不起我們。」（德襲著「禁城裏的兩年」）。歸根結底說，這位日本人實在和那批不承認中國人是人的歐美人一樣。日本人問只要存在着這種謬誤思想和荒唐行勸，則無論日本政府怎樣天花亂隊和堂哉皇哉的聲明，中國人是不會眞心誠意接受的。</p>
<p>大家都知道，目前支配中國的精神，是繼承辛亥革命的一貫優良傳統，辛亥革命，固然在表面上是「反對滿淸的民族革命」，但所謂「滿族」也者，老早以前就被漢族同化了，同時也可以說，滿族對漢族的統治關係，早已消形匿跡。所以辛亥革命的發動，決非漢族對滿族具有不共戴天的仇恨所致。然則辛亥革命的眞正動機爲何？實則因當時的國際環境，只要認爲是中國人，就要受外國人的看不起，辛亥革命就是反對這一點而爆發的。中國人奮然蹶起，想奠定中國的强勝基礎，而擺晚這種受辱的環境。但中國人都注意到，滿淸政府，並沒有日本政府指導日本那樣具有世界頭等國家的指導力，於是爲了首先剷除過程上的障碍物滿淸政府，便發動辛亥革命。所以正像辜鴻銘所說，辛亥革命是「反對忍受外國人侮辱中國人的政府而起的人民革命」，更正確一點說，「並非反對腐敗政府而起的革命，而是反對政府的軟弱無能或是反對懦弱政府而起的革命」。目前的巾國，這種國民革命的根本傳統精神，仍然在發揮光大着。中華民國肇始以來。幾經努力奮鬥，企圖跳出因是中國人而就受到世界人士侮辱的這種惡劣環境，而想創造因是巾國人而就受到世界人士尊敬的優良環境。凡阻撓中國人道一要求者，中國人就目爲巾華民族的惡敵，凡贊助這一要求者，就視爲中華民族的戰友。因此，上述日本某大國策公司對於巾國用人的侮辱熊度，事情雖小，但與巾國人的根本信念却大相抵屬。所以，日木政府無論怎樣聲嘶力竭地吶喊新政策，日本人也無論怎樣在報章雜誌上發表動聽的妙論，而中國人只要在日常生活中發現日本人對中國人的錯誤觀念不改，換言之，只要因是中國人而就受到日本人民打罵和侮辱，則日本人休想中國人承認日本爲中國的友邦。</p>
<p>聽說最近重慶有一個故事。即：美國飛機駕駛員會酩酊大醉，嘴　香烟，而在馬路右邊蹌踉而行。在馬路上吸香烟和靠右邊走，是新生活運動所不容許的，但警察因爲對方是美國人，而不敢加以阻攔，此時恰巧一位靑年軍官路過該地，於是嚴加指責這位美國人，說：「此處是巾國領土，所以你們必須遵守中國法律」。就是這樣，中國人固然對於他國毫無特別擺架子的野心，但對於僑居中國的外國人，也決不容許其看不起中國人。目前中國雖有和平區與抗戰區之分，但全部中國入的這種要求，知是只有一個。所以必須知道，日本某大國策公司對於中國人的侮辱，不僅會給和平區的中國人以惡劣影饗，而且會給抗戰區的中國人以惡劣影饗。（魯譯）</p>
<h3>中太平洋敵艦船　沉毀達五十餘艘　塞班島日軍繼續展開奮戰</h3>
<p>中部太平洋日軍某基地入日巾央社電自六月十一日敵出現馬里亞納海城以來，日陸海空軍各部隊果敢善戰，截至二十日擊毀其航空母艦·戰艦及共他艦船等達四十入艘以上，於敵以莫大打擊，嗣經判明，六月十八·十九兩日夜，於塞班島附近海面，擊沉敵航空母艦各一艘，計共二艘，確認業已擊沉，故馬里亞納海域及小笠原方而，自六月至三十日被擊沉與破壞之敵艦船等，實數已達五十艘以上。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電中部太平洋日軍某基地電，塞珊鳥日軍，猶在敵海陸空二方面之攻擊下繼續奪戰，五日更曾由該島北端特羅角南迄約六公里之地帶展開激戰後，日軍更向北方縮短整理戰綫，刻仍緩續激戰中。一方日軍有力挺進部隊復滑入塔保喬山附近敵陣，實行奇襲，敵軍陷於混亂。日空軍亦呼應陸上部隊之奮戰，於六日夜轟炸該烏敵軍，更於七日夜冒敵防空砲火，轟炸阿斯利特機塲一帶，是役日機轟炸歸來，已判明該島北端特羅角地區之戰鬥甚爲熾烈，於塔保喬山山麓附近，敵軍不斷放射照明彈，刻正與日挺進部隊展開激戰中。</p>
<h3>敵機再襲九洲　又被從容擊退　日本土防務鞏如鐵壁</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日大木營七月八日上午六時發表：八日上午二時許，有敵機十餘架，由大陸基地潛入九州西部及北部地區，日軍制空部隊當予邀擊，將之擊退，日方毫無損害。</p>
<p>東京八日中央社電　敵軍會於八日拂曉再作第二次空襲北九州，但遭日軍痛擊，復歸失敗，是役敵軍先以數架分成三編隊，一由西方海面侵入長崎·佐世保地區，遁往北方玄海灘方面，共他兩隊與上次取同路，由北方侵入北九州工業地帶後，一向東轉，自山口縣上空北上　逃，一向西迴避，逃於玄海灘，日方於敵機出現約一小時前，即已完全整妥邀擊態勢，尤其因第二次關係，諸般準備極其迅速。此次敵機空襲之企圖，似以轟炸北九州工業地帶與大村佐世保之海軍地區爲目標，共攻擊之際，力避使用炸彈，而以燒夷彈爲主。尤堪注月者，截至上午八時爲止，據同盟社北九州分局傳達於本社之報告，業已證賓擊落敵機三架，今次敵軍所使用之燒夷彈，未爆發者居多，已燃燒者亦多由於消防隊之出動，以及鄰組防火班之挺身撐救，完全熄減，至現在所判明者，只有果光市，戶畑市等二三處民房被毀，而并未有死傷，此實爲民間防空已奏成功之一大鐵證，又據長崎·佐世保·大村各分局報告稱，來襲該地方之敵機，雖爲五架至七架所編成之一隊，然各地并未落有一枚敵彈，僅於長崎市西南方海上投下炸彈，於日軍制空部隊追擊時，將B25型機一架擊落於長崎縣志佐町海岸，共對該方之空襲，亦悉歸失敗。</p>
<p>松島部長發表談話</p>
<p>日本駐華艦隊報道部松島部長，昨發表談話稱：據大木營發表，敵美駐渝空軍謀以B29轟炸機再度來襲我本土北九州及西九州，然我方制空部隊先行探悉敵機行動，當即起而攔截，擊退僅恃物量之敵空襲部隊，而我方損害則微乎其微，幾不足言。</p>
<p>敵美最近於太平洋作戰中蒙受意外之重大損失，即於小笠原羣島方面，如四日所發表，來襲敵機被擊隊七十四架以上，殘餘者倉皇遁走。又於塞班島方面，迄六月三十日止，敵方艦船之被擊沉擊毀老，共計四十八艘以上，被擊墜之敵機，亦達六百六十六架以上。</p>
<p>對此正感焦躁之敵，艦於最近渝軍在日軍大陸作戰中遭受重大打擊，以致華萊士之空頭支票亦難爲力，於是乃試圖空襲日木本土，以求一逞。</p>
<p>敵機此次雖已敗遁，然思及今日華中方面敵機之行動與空襲日木本土有關，則我人尚須嚴事戒備</p>
<p>綜觀美國量近不惜犧牲，而逐漸陷入灼熱柑　中之戰况，即可判明。例如美國軍令部次長曾說過「此戰將延至一九四九年」」一語因而被目爲無能者，且有「免職」之說，即此一例，可見一斑。即敵美將再增進其質量，反覆空襲，我人亦不介意，彼如來犯，決隨時隨地予以擊滅。彼等一日不喪失戰意戰力，我人亦一日不停止邀擊。</p>
<h3>淸遠附近　日軍增援進攻　日機猛炸衡陽渝軍</h3>
<p>日軍某基地八日中央社電　衡陽城內之渝預備軍第十師，及暫編第五十四師，雖已成爲袋中之鼠，然仍頑强抵抗，日軍轟炸機隊爲將之完全殲減，六日晚對之大行轟炸。是夜天氣淸朗，皓月當空，殺至衡陽上空之日機部隊，照準城內北端之敵軍司令部等，集結殘敵之屋舍與城壁，投中巨彈，因此衡陽市內一帶驟然火焰沖天，黑烟瀰漫，宛如地獄，日機全隊安狀飛返。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據重慶電，渝軍當局衡陽四週刻仍繼續激戰中，日軍於五日以飛機補給大量武器彈藥，猛烈轟擊渝軍各陣地，晶步兵即在此掩護下實行強襲，於六日夜仍繼續攻擊，渝軍亦努力防戰。　廣東戰綫，淸遠附近日軍，獲得各方增援，即再行攻擊渝軍各陣地。</p>
<p>英報評論中國戰事</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據倫敦電稱，觀察報外交特派員，五日特就日本於中國作戰選述如次：日軍於佔領長沙後，並通過衡陽，刻正向南方進擊中，渝方因日軍之進攻，而喪失重要交通綫及糧倉，此於軍事經濟上，實有莫大影響，尤以軍事方面，對於飽經戰爭之渝方民衆，將更加深其痛苦之程度。又渝方之益趨孤立，致使民衆參戰之氣氛亦隨之加深。由於渝方損失豐饒地區之結果，故重慶地區已陷於飢饑狀態中，而其經濟及財政之地位，亦隨之脆弱異常云云·又曼徹斯時導報，對於救援之困難事，亦曾加以指摘，謂重慶現在適值最苛烈之磨練期間，茲因反軸心各國不能以大量物資援渝，故長期間感受經濟壓迫之重慶，於未及一迵間，即將喪失中國東南部之豐富產米地區。</p>
<h3>羅斯福談　中國戰局</h3>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　華盛頓來電，美總統羅斯福七日會見新聞記者團，發表談話謂：最近中國戰綫之戰局，其動　查堪憂慮，重慶軍不能怚止日軍之進擊，一般美國國民不明中國實地情况之嚴重，若重慶完全敗北，則日美戰爭東趨長期化。</p>
<h3>緬甸富貢前綫　正展開激戰　日軍精銳摧毀敵企圖</h3>
<p>北細日軍前綫八日中央社電　渝英美聯軍，現於富貢前綫向加曼英附近侵入，彼等依人力與物量，曾企圖於佔領密芝那及慕加溫後，謀與由怒江渡河之雲南遠征軍取得連繫，而反復攻擊，日軍爲摧毀敵此種企圖，已以精銳部隊與之展開激戰，現敵軍兵力已逐漸轉弱，敵兵力之損傷，自去年十一月至本年六月入個月問，死傷者，投降與逃亡者及俘處者，共計己達三萬六千餘人，即以駐印渝軍某師言之，於六月前之損害，已達千入百八十六人，內中陣亡者佔百分之三十，長官陣亡者約達半數，故指揮官已感覺不足，又因渝英美合作關係，指揮系統已陷混亂，故對作戰影響頗大。</p>
<h3>東京等都市　決疏散學童</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電最近東京及日本其他各重要都市，均正加强防衛，前此日政府爲保護學童起見，曾考慮疏散方策，茲已決定根木方針，最近即將實施。日悄報局八日特就此事發表如次：政府關於疏散東京及其他各重要都市學童事，已決定根木方針，現正銳意檢討具體方策，最近即可賓施。疏散學童決避免强制實行，以勸獎爲原則，並積極獎勵向近親住宅實行疏散，至無適當親友者，則在政府管理下，按計劃實施集團疏散。應使作集團疏散之學童，規定爲國民學校初等科二年級以上至六年級之學生。疏散地點儘量選擇與家庭交通速絡便利之地點，於疏散完畢後，現在之教職員，自須前往繼續執教，更須照科飲食，籌儲食糧及共他必需品等，至其細目，最近即可發表。</p>
<h3>日佛敎會舉行大東亞孟蘭會</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社常日木佛教讚仰會，爲安慰共榮圈內各國戰歿者之靈，特於八日下午一時，假此間久段軍人會館舉行「大東亞孟關會」，由木　管門導師主持，各國學生及代表多出席，盛况空前。屆時日大東亞大臣。厚生大臣，松村東京都次長，相繼出席演說，又葵巾華民國大使，王滿洲國大使，烏基特泰國大使警，亦均以各國言語誦經，最後并有日木女學生，中華國民學校學生合唱，鋼琴獨奏等遊　節目，五時後始散會。</p>
<h3>日政府實施改革　決戰時地方行政　—防空本部設置專任次長—</h3>
<p>東京八日中央社電　日木政府爲刷新決戰時之地方行政，尤其對產業經濟行政以期增加生產起見，前曾對此加以慎重檢討，已於四日閣議中決定具體方案，八日官報將之發表，並決定自即日起實施，茲誌所發表之主要者如次：　於防空總本部設置專仟次長，　整備强化地方行政機構，　廳府後縣之經濟部，實施二部制，　整備地方努力行政機構。按以往防空總本部次長一職，乃係大臣，專心致力於任，今次已改專任，以輔佐內務大臣，專心致力於防空對策。關於強化地方行政機構，首於大坂·福岡·愛知三大重要府縣設置此長，以輔佐府縣長官，對地方行政負綜合運營之責。所謂經濟之事部制，第一部係食糧，行政食糧以外之一般產業經濟行政及土木關係事項，皆由第二部掌管，並爲軍需增產之對外運絡之中區，以求經濟行政之圓滑。又因鑒於勤勞行政於現時局下之重大性所加強厚生省勞動之組織機構，警視廳及警察局變各設置勞動部，專門管理勞動行政，以期使國民勞動及勤勞配備之更趨圓滑化。關終地方行政之刷新，自去年七月設置行政協議會以來，成績已逐漸進展，經此次從新改革後，定可獲得預期之成果。</p>
<h3>鮑斯向甘地　披瀝眞情</h3>
<p>仰光八日巾央社電　鮑斯六日假廣播電台向甘地翁披瀝眞情，大意如次：甘地翁閣下，印度之黎明愈益接近，因之本人最近之兩大確信益見强問，即一天賦祖國解放之申機已見到來，决非難成功之事，其二欲驅逐英國不得不藉外力，閣下亦深知對付老獪之英國政府，絕非單憑道義與不流而丰段所能獲得成果者。現在英國政府之意圖，在榨取吾等之骨而，故吾等自下應努力從事者，印度國培熾烈之反英闢爭及援助印度之奮關兩事。大東亞戰爭勃發，可謂爲印度團結及獲得軸心軍援助之良好機會，木人曾充分考席第三國之援助，實與英國所宣傳者相反，吾相信比種援助，對印度絕對有利。</p>
<h3>日水野總理　電賀鮑斯</h3>
<p>東京八日中央於電　日本大政　贊會興亞　本部水野總理，際茲即實獨立聯盟主辦之「　　　袖週」期問內，特向　　主席發出祝電，祝自由　度即日完成獨立。</p>

<h3>林宣長對渝廣播「爭取主動的出路」（續）</h3>
<p>第二個問題，「歐陸戰局所將引起政治態勢可能的轉變，應該怎機處理，這個問題提出以後，重慶方面好像已在着手處理，所以有重慶與莫斯科間的往還，有華萊士的來訪。其實這樣的處理，還是被動的多，主動的少。我們要請重慶方面加以注意，別再上人家的當，白白將自己的祖國，被人家出費了。</p>
<p>第三個問題，當時所要問的，「我們應該怎樣配合在大東亞戰爭，與歐陸戰爭的階段上，把握着緩急先後，千鈞一髮的時機，爭取唯一可能，而有利解決。是否不了了之，要在既不是戰，又不是和的窘狀底下，白白任人宰制」。這個問題，自然會有種種不同的看法，有些人以為橫豎打了六七年，何妨再拖一拖，等等看。有此人以為勝敗之數，尚未可知。就算英美敗，也決不至於英亡美滅，跟英美在一起，總中比較合算的。這間直是生為英美奴隸的劣根性，真可說是「是非不明，利害不辨」。姑勿論英美敗，就算英美勝，根據三二百年來英美宰割世界的往事，那時候中國還不成了組上之肉嗎？此中利害，顯而易見。若就是非來說，盟邦日本所屢次聲明大東亞戰爭的意義，願與中國為友，不以中國為敵，為什為敵呢？</p>
<p>第四個問題，當時所要問的，「共產黨已成燎原之勢，是否任其坐觀中國不亡於戰之慘敗，不亡於和之未成，而亡於共產黨之趁火打刦」。對於這個間題，重慶方面國民黨同志，以及其他人士所知道的，必然比我們更為灤切，更為焦急，撇開對像邦交，以及共產黨理論，及其政治主張不談，祇就現實問題來說，武力反抗蔣介石，共產黨的策略，決議在外戰未結東以前，發動內戰，共產黨的杭戰方略，用燾政民主還動牽制蔣氏，進而限制蔣氏的權力，再進而獲取雄厚的國際力，引起反蔣運動的爆發，是共產黨的宣傳綱要，這一切重慶的特工，應該對蔣先生有很詳細的報告。（未完待續）</p>
<h3>敎部闡釋　徵收學費要點</h3>
<p>南京八日中央社電　中央教育當局規定自下學年起，各地為提高教職員待遇，除師範學校外，各級學校均須繳收學費。茲教育部就徵收學費事項，闡釋要點如次：　教育為國家事業，原應力求减低國民受教育之費用，惟目前一般傃給不能隨物價並增，教師待遇更較菲薄，確有籍學費挹注，暫謀安定教師生活之必要。　近年物價變動匪可朦測，甲地與乙地生活發用，每相縣殊，學盡數目自不宜統一限制，由各省市酌斟實際情形及學校需要，擬訂標準，經核定後，　施徵收。　微收學費後，各校仍須酌設免費學額，以容納淸塞學生。及服務教育文華界人員，與低級公務員之子弟，俾不致因無力納費而失學。</p>

<p>柏林八日中央社電　據德軍前綫消息：克恩地區僅十二公里連續之弧形戰綫上，兩軍兵力共十萬，戰車二千輛，目前進入塵前之混戰狀態。</p>
<p>里斯本八日中央社電　據路透社戰地特派員報稱，德軍六日傍晚自東南方續向克恩區增强大軍</p>
<p>瑞典京城八日中央社電　海通社訊，英方消息：英軍於今晨四時三十分向克恩西南發動進攻，並傳卡倫坦。拉海前綫之美軍，已進抵距離聖琴達伊以北一哩之處，美軍在維爾之橋頭堡，亦謂已將深度擴大為一哩闊二哩半。另悉，拉海杜布伊戰事今已演變為砲戰，德軍居於有利地位，美軍在極南端憶進抵拉海西南二　之莫貝克。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　海通社訊：柯坦汀半島之美軍，昨日下十尚桑洛方面發動大規模之進攻。</p>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期四日英美于軍雖以優勞部隊作戰，但到處均未能穿入德軍之陳綫，亦無陣地上之進展，足作大攻勢之預步。德軍在若千地方不得不放棄陣地而向北撤退，但各部隊間並未失去聯絡，仍能控制各處局勢。反軸心軍已在阿萊查之南開始新展開行動，預料該地區內將續有大規模進攻，英軍與波蘭軍重在亞特里亞地區發動强大攻勢，奧西諾與斐拉特拉奈附近，激戰數小時後，敵以重大代價突破缺口數處，各缺口戰事至星期五上午仍在進行中。</p>
<h3>國府宣戰佈告</h3>
<p>前年十二月八日大東亞戰爭發動之始，國民政府根據中日基本關係條約之精神，聲明决與友邦日本同甘共苦。自是以來，着手新國民運動，從事保障治安，改善民生，期於增進國力，協助大東亞戰爭之兀遂、乃英美等國仍沿用其百年以來分裂東亞之政策，目變本加厲，竟勾引渝方分子，參加所謂英美戰綫，出兵緬印，以東亞人殘殺東亞人，最近因其暴力已次第為友邦日陸海空軍所擊破，侵略東亞之根據地亦已喪失，乃益逞狡謀。且嫉視國民政府統治區域之和平發展，且嗾使渝方分子不斷侵擾，以阻撓各種建設之進行，並逕以自國飛機，藉渝方為根據，向我武漢廣州等處屢施轟炸，殘害平民，在渝方分子，甘受英沒驅使，躬為東亞叛逆，固屬可恥：而英美對於東亞處心積慮，盡其挑撥離間之能事，以圖遂其最後倂吞之欲，尤為東亞民族所當同仇敵愾，國民政府為此宣告，自今日起，對英美處於戰爭狀態，當悉其全力，與友邦日本協力，一掃英美之殘暴，以謀中國之復興，東亞之解放。滿泰兩國，夙敦及好，對於東亞共榮，尤具同心，今後當益謀提携，以期共同建設以道義為基礎之東亞新秩序，德義諸友邦，數年以來，在西方與英美勢力周旋。迭獲勝利之光榮，我國今茲參加大東亞戰爭，當相與呼應，以期對於世界全體之公正的新秩序有昕貢獻，凡我國民，當知此為實現國父大亞洲主義之唯一時會，中華民國之復興，大東亞共榮建設之實現，世界全體信義和平之獲得，　　於此。其一德一心，戮力始終，以貫徽此偉大時代之偉大使命！</p>

<h3>東綫夏季攻勢　重心南移　中路北翼惡戰未已</h3>
<p>柏林八日中央社電　德國新聞社訊：星期四日東綫戰事特點，為防禦戰之向南蔓延，蘇軍在柯維爾，魯資克與泰諾波爾各地開始行動，其範圍已超出平常在斥侯性之零碎攻勢之性質。其在柯維爾與魯資克迤西之作戰，以坦克軍一旅為掩護前進，在魯資克西面突破之缺口一處·經德軍反攻即被堵合，蘇軍司令部顯然欲擴大其攻勢至南路前綫各區，柯維爾附近魯資古與泰諾波爾等處所發生之戰事，大概即為此項趨勢之第一步。中路之防禦戰仍集中於各舊焦點，維爾諾東南與奈羅茲湖西北之巴倫諾維契地峽之爭奪戰尤為劇烈。德守軍集中於市鎮之東部邊界，蘇軍以優屢次企圖發動側面包圍之戰略，均被德軍所阻。學洛特契　迤南之戰事尤為劇烈，德軍陣綫後撤至咸煦尼附近林森林區，斯摩蓋尼斯附近星期四亦竟日惡戰，蘇軍在摩托化部隊編隊掩護下企圖突破，但被擊退，杜埃那河南岸德軍橋頭堡二處予以放棄，蘇軍以集中之步槍兵與坦克軍編隊，屢次企圖擊潰普洛資竟迤北與西北之德軍陣地，結果均在德軍防禦砲火下崩潰。</p>

<h3>關於陳友仁先生的一個報吿</h3>
<p>— 李微塵</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>陳先生旣歿，即時須處理的便是殯殮和安葬兩事，因為這兩事的處理都和陳先生的意旨和遺　有關，我亦該將經過略為報告，並將他的遺屬發表。</p>
<p>在陳先生歿後的半小時，在他的書房裹我們討論他的後事，當時曾有這探一個主張。將陳先生的遺該暫時寄厝在上海·俟戰後再移葬武漢，那個永久象徵着他的關爭，功勛，和中國革命的活潑而富有劍造力時代的武漢。但陳夫人不贊同。她鎮定着向我們說：「我丈夫平時告訴我，如果他光我而死，我該將他的遺體火化，不莽地，不樹碑，遺灰散諸大洋，這諸太虛」效並且告訴我們：喪儀應以不道背她丈夫生平簡機的習慣為主，殮服當用他平素所穿着的，各朋友所習見的一製藏靑色的長袍，遺容絕不脩飾，火葬應儘速舉行，一切不從俗禮，花圈挽聯一切應辭謝，陳夫人這意見，我們只好照辦，依照這意旨，各人商議至四時許才散去，只有張芸英女史留着陪伴陳夫人。我則沉默着獨坐在書房中。</p>
<p>到五時十分左右，一位平時和陳先生不常會面而每過患難必出現的朋友陳孚木先生趕到來了，他對遺容徘徊瞻仰了許久，搖着頭，說不出什麼話，只表示　　助一切，並將汽車供喪事的使用，在交通工具缺乏的今日，這是難得的。</p>
<p>本來約好六時左右將遺體送到殯儀館，但陳夫人令再延遲些時，便在涕淚中，站在榻前，為她丈夫畫一幅最後的速寫。那時的情景和她的心境，用文字來描寫是不夠的，恕我繪寫不出來了。</p>
<p>約過十餘分鏡，速寫畫完了，我才同陳手木先生兩人乘着馬車在晨光曦微風蕭蕭雨織織中伴送陳先生的遺體到萬國殯儀館去。</p>
<p>九時左右，顏駿人和責漢樑先生都到殯儀館來，對於一切，多所指導。就在當時才決定二十二日下午三時先在靜安寺　團禮堂舉行最簡樸儀式，隨即舉行火化。</p>
<p>約十時一刻，陳夫人來了。許多朋友亦來了，都很誠摯的表示願盡奔走帮忙。因為舉行火葬例須先由法院檢騐遺體，而當日是星期六，法院下午例不辦公，幸得陳彬龢先生熱心奔走，懇請法院立即派員檢視，不然恐怕二十二日火葬是來不及的。關於二十二日舉行的儀式，各報俱有紀載，無須我再詳細報告。我只好說這次儀式是再簡單沒有，僅由黃漢樣博士宣佈儀式的開始，由顏駿人博士略致悼詞。顏先生的言詞是動人的，自不必說，他從三十三年交誼的體會中，很虛懷的，公平的，恰當的說出陳先生的學問，抱負，而尤强調他的愛護國家的精神。如果嚴格細按顏先生的全篇悼詞，我能提出異議的，只有一句話。這點，且保留在下面解說陳先生的言行思想時再說。</p>
<p>此外，當日來致弔者除陳先生的一些朋友外各階層的中外人士都有。日本上海陸軍部長官川本將軍亦親來致弔，並且這人致意陳失人，如有疑難，願艦可能，予以方便。這人類真摯的同情，倒是不可　的道義。以外，一位從前曾在蔣介石將軍底下喧赫一時的德國顧問和幾位蘇聯及法國的作家亦親來致最後的敬禮。</p>
<p>但最動人的却是一位鄉下老太婆。她在儀式舉行前便蹣跚而來，向靈柩合十鞠躬後又悄然而去。另一位是從前當過小兵的，在某種塲合上是曾見過陳先生的。他那天居然從蘇州跑來，要我派他「差事」。後來我給他飯錢，他堅決的拒絕，對我說：「小兄弟恭敬陳部長，如果要飯錢，便不是恭敬」。陳先生歿後，我沒有眼淚，但這位從前當小兵的懇切真摯和動人的態度却使我忍耐不住，却使我的眼淚奮眶而出。</p>
<p>還有一位日本小兵。池在儀式舉行時居然流起淚來，哭不可仰。如果那天曾麥樂，流淚並不稀奇，但那天却沒有。他和陳先生並無一面之雅，當然說不上關係。他大概是一位日本的靑年智識份子吧。他那超越國界，超越硝烟氣氛的眼淚多麼動人的心絃！</p>
<p>最後，那些靑年們在瞻仰遺容流露着的沉痛，是情感的和理智的沉痛。他們是代表着中國的靑年層。我要對他們說：陳先生向來是期待着你們的，他還在期待着你們，中國的靑年！</p>
<p>有許多朋友們因為陳先生向來是廉介自持的，便關懷到道次的喪費。我得在此聲明，這次因為殯儀館當事人對陳先生人格的景仰，特別客氣，殯殮火化和一切的費用，僅收二萬五千兀，因此，全部喪費不出三萬元的數目。我並得聲明，這次朋友們致送的厚膊，雖意良可感，輙多奉璧。這是我對陳先生的瞭解上不得不如此辦的。如果因此便開罪了，是我對不起各位。</p>
<p>喪事的報告，到此便告一段落。</p>
<p>如今我該報告陳先生的遺囑了。上面說過，陳先生的遺旨是將「遺灰散諸大洋，還諸太處」，但遺囑發見後，才知道陳先生對這點已有所修正，他主張將遺灰「散諸中國的大江或沿海」，他是永久在留戀着祖國的！永遠要保衛中國的江海的。</p>
<p>下面是遺囑的譯文：</p>
<p>「此為余最後之遺囑。余名陳友仁，又各Eugene　Chen；余妻名陳荔英或陳張荔英又名Geprgetle　Chen凡余現時所有或將來所有，或死時所有之一切，無論屬任何種類性質之產業或偶人所有物，余將全部授予，遺贈及遺給余妻。</p>
<p>「余聲明如後：只有余妻得代表余之名養用余名義及代余發言；凡屬於或關於全之一切及有關於余之名譽與名聲者，只有余妻得發表聲明，或加以否認及批駁；凡關於余造體之處置，無論用任何方式與方法，如余妻認為適宜者，余妻得全權處置之，此並包括將余遺體火化及將遺灰散諸中國之大江或沿海。</p>
<p>「余並聲明：余是純粹中國人，余父與母俱藉隸廣東：余並欲使眾周知，凡非純粹中國血統之人，無論男女，余俱屏絕及不承認彼等與余有任何視屬及威屬關係。如遇有敢提出異議者，余茲付託余妻必須維持余之原意。如余妻為此採取任何行動或訴訟，余切求余所有友人無論是中國人或其他黃種國人，對余妻予以援助，並予支持。公歷一九四二年十一月二十六日立於上海　陳友仁（Eugene　Chen）」</p>
<p>這是陳先生的遺囑，和上面所說他在香港大酒店裹對我口述的遺囑當然是性質完全不同。那個這遺囑現在是沒有發表的必要，只好牢鎖在我心中的深處，供我欣賞，和供我碰到危難關頭時作一面明澈的借鏡。</p>
<p>關於上面發表的遺囑，我亦應有所說明。</p>
<p>一：遺囑原文是英文的。英文法律文件是不獻求詳的，務求明確的。所以便用着許多意思彷彿是重複而却有些微差異的詞句。我繙譯時，只好依照原文的體裁，希冀保全原來的面目，但原文用詞的簡鍊，和文句的美，這是我搬譯不過來的。</p>
<p>二：陳先生在遺囑中很明確的聲明，得代表他的，得用他的名義的和得代他發言的，只有他的夫人。這點我却要請那些現在假托着陳先生的名義在活動，說是要實行所謂「收拾時局的治國平天下」妙策的人們注意。</p>
<p>三：陳先生在遺囑中鄭重聲明他是純粹中國人，這是有原因的。為因陳先生感到他的國語不足以傳達複雜的思想，他便當用英語。這不容諱言的是他生平的最大弱點。因為有空弱點，反對他的人們便誣衊他，說他是混血的一而不是純粹的中國人。當他轟轟烈烈代表著中國民族主義發言的武漢時代，這種誣衊便最盛行，常常見諸英國的雜誌和書報。就是前幾年在約翰根室的「亞洲內幕」裹，亦繼續着這種惡意的而却亳無意義的誕嶼。根室或許是無他，大概是受了端納的愚弄。「一狗吠，百狗隨吠」，人性和理智還沒有超越這階段，這未免是可惜。陳先生藉　廣東順德。他的太夫人義隸廣東番禺，八歲時因太平天團失敗，便隨父母逃亡海外，現年九十餘，寰宇烽煙，音畫斷絕，今想仍健在也。陳先生的父親亦是因為太平天國的崩潰而亡命海外的。所以在血統上，陳先生的血管裹循環流着的不獨是純粹中國人的血，並且是中國民族主義者和革命者的熱血、他的革命的性格，革命的熱情，可以說是「與血俱來」的而決不是偶然的。</p>
<p>四：陳先生在遺囑最末後一段，對於非純粹中國血統的人與他的親屬和戚屬關係，聲明屏絕及不承認。這個決意是陳光生的友好所周知的，在答復朋友的畫札中，他曾屢次很明確的聲明過。六年前，因為一位道類的親馬假托他的名義作政治活動，他亦曾兩告有關的軍政當局，作鄭重聲明。五年前，他為這事並且在香港英文南華早報亦曾公開發表過類此的聲明，陳先生對人對事的態度是不含糊的，這是一個例。（未完待續）</p>

<h3>市民遊園演講會　昨晚熱烈舉行中央海校姜校長主講</h3>
<p>上海新聞聯合會為使全市民眾深切瞭解太洋目前戰局，並加强必勝信念起見，關於昨（八）日下午七時假靜安寺路哈同花聞舉行市民遊團演講會，專請中央海軍學校校長姜西圓中將難演，全市各界民眾馮勢前往醫詳者，頗為按獨，並有影星歌唱名曲，及放映電影，以佐餘與·情况塞前熱烈，茲分誌詳情如次：</p>
<p>大會盛況</p>
<p>市民遊園演講大會會場，設哈同花園中央廣場內，第一警察局樂隊特立塲雙樂，中華電影公司亦派員拍攝大會新聞片，夢校長准時偕同僚屬蒞會外，並到盟邦麗嚴報道部平田大尉，林囑託，暨工商各界名流，船津辰一郎，陳紹娣暨該會各報常務理事許力求，陳彬龢，陸光杰，翁永淸，魯風，朱永康，程仲權，及總幹專任雲鵬等，本市民衆聽講者不下數千餘人，情緒至為熱烈。萬由該會值月主席理事許力求致開會辭，路謂：值茲大東亞戰爭決勝利段之期，前方消息已進戰各報，我人為鑒定必勝信念，特於今日舉行園遊演講會，請養校長蒞會演講。　校長歷年致力　就中國海軍人才，故今日諸君誌畢美氏演講後，對現戰局之信念，深信益為堅强，大東亞戰爭最後勝利，即將蒞臨。最後對軍　當局之協助會塲治安。來寶各署參加，表示無限謝意。旋請養校長演講，首對太平洋目前戰局作詳切分析，及深盼中國民眾加强信念協力完成大東亞戰爭云云。綱舉行歌唱餘興，放映華影巨片鳳鳳和鳴電影，至　晚十時半始盡歡散會。</p>
<p>姜氏演講</p>
<p>中央進軍學校校長姜西國氏演講，略講：今日承新聞聯合會之相邊，在此向諸君說明日前太平洋戰局之情勢，兄弟對此一國，實為義不客辭。值茲太平洋決戰期間，我人應有如何之決心。自六月十一日以來，在寂寞）時後的太平洋，敞人竟乘機開始攻擊。查敵英自跳島作戰失敗後，寫進而作中央突擊戰，滿以在太平洋上，可對盟邦本土加以威靑，或挾取南洋，但在南洋亳無進展，竟施其使倆，向馬利亞納羣島，小笠原靈島，採取中央突破。此等　門農斧，實不足為　邦神勇將士稱寄，敵美該項戰術，當必無法表現。故我人對戰局之判斷，應從全應着想，不可從小處加以臆測。查敵庚之僥倖夢想，必連火敗無疑，一無收獲可取，如今我人對今後戰局之觀測，在目前本於作戰期內，無分勝負，一旦正規戰之開始，殘敵必大敗亂竄。其次，敵利用機小鳥之一隅，向日本土威脅，在事實上又絕不可能。且彼向日內線後犯，而在補給綫上又感覺邊遠之困難，敵美之前途，當盆為黑暗。查敵方在太平洋上，前所採取之跳島作戰結果，巳折腿斷臂，身受重創。今又在塞班島喪失戰設計進四十餘變外，飛機已達六七百架之多，則今後再經盟邦將士神勇之猛擊，當可全部崩潰。敵方之自不最力，以一小島之利用，耗盡大量武器，實為智者所不取，關於敵方此次之企圖，不出於緩和國內之興論，以挽同民心，好在盟邦日本之戰鬥，向遵照東鄉元帥之不朽精神發揮，以逸待勞，總在不久的正規戰上，充分表現。明敵猶不自知錯誤，但其土氣俎喪，同時敵美內心之炊急原因，蓋自七八月後之太平洋氣候，即將劇變，那時颶風勃發，可憐教養的敵羹海軍，斷難忍受顛沛之苦。獨盟邦將士訓練有素，應付經裕，因此在地理上，又為敵力失敗之一例。故吾人值茲目前劇戰階段時期，萬不可以隔岸觀火，作袖手旁觀之舉，斯在參戰過程中是要不得的。當上次世界大戰結東，為什變我國雖告勝利，而不能爭取利益，所以我人在今次定須加倍努力，幷反省過去錯誤，深署設軍應深切瞭解，大東亞戰爭乃東亞民菸相共患難，決不能推諉。故國府之參戰，意味　遠。查過去中日間之料紛，慘遇外人之離間，待自展開大東亞戰爭後，在一個民族的決心下，相共禦侮，故我人應刻苦耐勞，為中日兩國之前途，相互協力，驅逐歐美侵略勢力。</p>
<h3>搬米五斗一律實施徽講發照所奉命昨起開始</h3>
<p>米糧統制委員會各臨時發照所，於日昨奉該會視察室三十三年七月六日函開，「案奉秘書長諭，各發照所以後臨時證明單之申請五斗者，亦一律徵購等因奉此，特此通告」各臨時發照所奉命後，除佈告週知外，已於七月七日起實施一律徵購。</p>
<p>短評</p>
<h3>難道再可漠視不顧嗎</h3>
<p>米統會自·七月一日起實施徵購五斗以上人口米糧，又自七日起即五斗者亦一律徵講。我們對於徵購辦法的失富，已在七日社評中根據統計概切言之。而太市各報與論對於米糧問題更一致獻議，可是言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，米統會當局未能稍加注意民情及輿論所趨，一意孤行，使民食問題日趨嚴重，不能不架引為憾。</p>
<p>徵瞞之事，觀於成績之惡劣，可知弊實楚生，事實上形格勢禁，而必欲堅持成見，置民生於不頭，試問何以自解。　我們認為糧價的激漲，重苦民生，米統會應負絕對責任。而商統會既已調整為米統會之監督指導機關，對於米統會不合理措施，商統會自有料正責任，而不容推托。上海市政府當局是全市民的父母之官，對於米糧因不合理措施而民生遭遇嚴重痛苦，巾府也有糾正責任，而不容任令孤斷獨行。同時，盟邦當局案來關心中國民生問題，目前上海民食問題已至生死嚴重問題，料相盟邦雷局也不致坐視。</p>
<p>最後，我們要問，米統會究竟隸屬於那一個機關的？上級機關是否應該行使着督料正的職權？現在無論任何個人，任何家庭，任何公私機關團體，誰不為了食米問題而焦燥不安。米統會既然可以堅持成見，不福民生，漢視民情。可是，民食的嚴甫，已到如此地步，難道商統會與市府區局也可以漢視，不題民生之日益痛苦的嗎？</p>
<h3>印反英照片展覽　今日揭幕</h3>

<h3>防空心得</h3>
<p>— 藤山愛一郎</p>
<p>歐洲登陸侵攻戰，終於展開。盟邦德國非常歡迎英美的上陸作戰，全國厲矣秣馬，進入了決戰階段。我們亦正期待美國的太平洋侵攻作戰，希望能有機會予以迎頭痛擊。去年以來，全國所要求飛機和艦船的增加，就是我個的準備。現在全國上下，不問老幼男女，應該在各人責任範圍以內，傾全力於增產運動，這就是我們對付物費豐富美國的唯一致勝要素。決戰的階段一天接近一天，敵機的來襲亦必實現，我們應該有充分的準備，以期萬全。去冬以來，漢堡以及柏林的大空襲，給予我們非常良好的教訓。</p>
<p>航空作戰的目的，乃在利用都市的空襲，攪亂人心，同時對於各種生產設施的空襲，使生產力破壞，藉以减低敵方的交戰力。</p>
<p>假如港灣設施及橋樑等遭受破壞，運輸力勢必减低，生產上勢必受影響，同時工塔遭破現，勢必直接影響於全國的生育力，敵人所希望的，亦即亦此。</p>
<p>國民過去，人民沉　應戰，已克服種種困難了，在五百架，一千架的敵機集團抄炸之下，德國人民能盡責的保衛國土，防止生產力的低溶。不但僅僅防止生產力的低落，並且在猛烈的空製之下，更總續努力於增進生產。因此，德國尙有餘裕，與英美的上陸軍隊一決雌雄</p>
<p>在日本，也預期空襲的來臨，所以或致力於疏嚴工作，或致力於防空訓練，不論敵機何日來臨，我們時時刻刻在準備着。政府方面熱心的指導，以及國員自身的緊張觀念，使每一個國民都痛切的感覺到防空的重要，所以疏散工作的進行非常順利，訓練也亳不間斷，保衛團土的工作，一天一天的堅强起來，開之不勝欣快。</p>
<p>但是，這决不能使我們十分滿足，現在的防空體制，還不能使我們絕對安心。</p>
<p>過去我國的防空對策；重心在於燈火管制或其他偽裝，盡量遭免敵機的轟炸，使人命的犧牲減少至最小限度，同時利用消防的訓練，防止受損　圍的擴大。過去國民的訓練，對於以上各點，已有相當的成績。</p>
<p>但是，這種防空對策，是否根本忽視防空中最重要的工作？</p>
<p>從今日戰爭的情形看來。最重要的工作，乃是如何迅速恢復被破壞的生產力，使生產力不因空襲而致低落；同時，如何恢復被破壞的運輸力，使其能在瞬刻之間，仍能輸送生產物資和維持人民生活的食糧。至於通訊設備方而，亦須即刻復舊，不使生產工作受到絲亳影響。</p>
<p>在德國，空襲之後不出數日，國民的生產活動已完全恢復，可是德國的生產界，雖然受到如此火規模的空襲，但仍有迅速恢復的準備，防止生產力的低落到最低限度。</p>
<p>今日的情勢之下，官民應同心嚴力，鄭重研究對於被破壞的地方應如何復舊，應如何予以迅速重建等方策，使一切準備都能趨於萬全。所以，訓練和演習是十分必要的。</p>
<p>欲重建被破壞的工塲，將如何動員必耍的勞動者，如何集中大批的資材？同時若移被破壞的工塲於他地，將有如何處置去實行，以增加生產力？這許多問題，現在若沒有充分的準備，將來必致臨陣恐慌，手足無措的。</p>
<p>為要迅速恢復受損的工塲，現在各個毘鄰相接的生產公司的壁垣，恐有撤除一部份的必要，因此，各種法令亦須有適當的準備。至於勞動者的移動或集中，假如依舊根據舊有的觀念，决不能得到良好的效果。</p>
<p>生產問題所關聯的節關極為廣泛，不僅是資材與勞務問題而巳，甚至運輸，食糧，金融方面，亦須互相呼應，樹立周密的計劃不可。假如空襲下的交通和通信的聯絡，若失去本能時，各檢處置施策的傳逆，不能圓滑進行，徒然招引混亂的狀態。同時更將影響到整個經濟界的不安和動搖，如是人心不定，產榮能率的低落，將不警可喻。</p>
<p>計劃的樹立確是難事，但是，愈是困難，愈是應有堅忍的勇氣去處置一切。在增加飛機，增加船舶的呼聲中，此種對策尤須　備充足。政府在賽查各項重大問題時，必須從現在開始充分的準備；同時在民間方面，亦須以統制會寫中心，就各種問題應充分對發過當的處理方策。尤其是生產問題，若是離開現實，各種法令命令祇是空文而已。</p>
<p>另一方面，民間的產業界，亦須同時考慮到處置的方策，各同業的意見着不一掃已往各自成見，則重新生產的重大責任，將無從推行。</p>
<p>這就是最重要的防空對策，最重要的勵行戰爭的空襲對策。</p>
<p>防空的二大要素即：使損害維持至最低限度，有各種準備使受損工塲得以迅速恢復，假如進二點都能完備，則防空對策的目的，可說已經達到。（纔：譯自六月十一日擅賣報知）</p>

<h3>誤國者爲誰　上海日大使館情報部長</h3>
<p>— 鬆平忠久</p>
<p>中日事變發生以　，迄今已屆七週年，自大東亞戰爭爆發後，亦已曆時二年有半，目今大東亞各民族，正逢到決定其命運之階段。</p>
<p>餘並無意思詮議此次戰爭之責任者爲誰，但冷靜觀察最近十餘年來中日兩國之關係，使中日兩國之命運，導於不幸，確有原因在焉。且可逆科今後世界戰爭之一部分——日英戰爭日美戰爭——將在中國領土上更　　烈，同時中華民國之命運，益加困難，於此亦有其原因。今就此點　諸過去公正的歷史，（一部分爲尚未公開之事實）略述管見。</p>
<p>何人使英美加入東亞方面之糾紛</p>
<p>東亞在歷史上的轉捩，因事變而始，但日本主張㈠不擴大主義㈡直接交涉。當時中國國民政府初對日本此項主張表示贊意。　光公使開始與宋子文折衝，惟至第三日宋子文忽然變卦通告日本謂中國以滿洲事變訴諸國際聯盟。是年春汪精衛，孫科，古應芬，唐紹　，陳友仁，李宗仁，白崇禧，陳濟棠，唐生智等會集於廣州，召集非常會議，建立反蔣的國民政府，廣東國民政府之主張爲直接交涉，　陳友仁與孫科提案準備向日本正式直接交涉之各種基礎條件時，餘在席上，對於孫科之表情如何，又陳友仁之臉色如何，均有清楚的感覺。然日本以承認南京國民政府，尚未承認廣東之政府，故仍依照宋子文等之意見進行，黃色人種的中日雙方代表，在國際聯盟站於白色人之面前受　問　言，而英美干涉東亞問題益告得寸進尺。</p>

<p>在西安事變未發生之前，湖北省主席楊永泰突遭暗殺，時餘適服務於漢口，曾於此政學系大前輩臨終時尚會最後之一面。當楊氏被擡往同仁病院，餘立即前往慰問，時何成　已先在，對痛苦失聲之楊夫人殷殷勸慰，楊永泰在出席美國總領事午餐後返家途中，被人民戰線派狂擊，此事件發生前，中日間不祥事件層出不窮，例如成都事件，居住於北海之日僑中野氏被害事件，漢口吉　巡查之暗殺事件等，爲同樣性質，至後來始　發覺。嗣暗殺楊永泰之凶手即被逮捕，經繼續檢舉黨　結果，始悉對日本人所　不祥事件，無一不爲以人民戰線派爲標榜之共産黨的勾當。彼等陰謀企圖，惹起中日間糾紛，暗殺反共派份子，甚至蔣介石亦爲他們目標之一。據闖何成溶談，共産黨會有計劃，派特殊工作人員混入蔣登　山時所用之轎夫中，企圖在蔣介石登廬山時，即在山谷間下毒手，並悉張學良與上海七君子互通聲氣，彼之部下極多赤化份子，當蔣介石於洛陽度過五十歲誕辰後，意欲巡　張學良之剿共部隊，但陳誠事先赴洛陽逐一報告共産黨之陰謀，竭力陰蔣前往西安，然蔣毫不介意，遂被扣留於西安，此使中國之歷史作一百八十度之轉變。</p>
<p>西安事變結束之謎</p>
<p>西安事變發生後，南京方面何應欽等主張討伐張學良楊虎城，即使因討伐而累及蔣介石生命，亦所不計，大部人士認爲蔣介石平安返南京，似極少希望，然是時餘間接自共産黨員得到令人驚異的情報，謂蔣介石於二星期內可返抵南京，或謂國共可妥協，國民政府政策將有大大轉變等等，餘當時以爲　有此種事實，僅付　一笑而已，然未幾宋美　宋子文乘機赴西安，何應欽等主戰論無形消散，蔣介石亦得生還，而張學良等即跟蹤而來，反受　　。此種事實可謂滑稽之至。蔣及宋所著“西安半月記”對於共産黨折衝，無一言提及，究竟　如何一句話，而得使蔣介石生還，尚屬一個謎。惟以後的事態變化，與以前共産黨員所說者，大致無甚相差。</p>
<p>關於中日恢複和平</p>
<p>蔣爲何受他國意見之左右：事變發生後，德國曾作居間展開中日間和平交涉，事在民國廿七年至廿八年初，此爲週知之事實。當時蔣介石之態度，其中關於對和平條件之意見，在汪主席“舉一個例”的論文中，詳細記述，又在場之白崇禧徐永昌唐生智等又作如何意見，於此論文中，亦加詳述。</p>
<p>蔣介石稱：“如無此一條，則此條件亦非亡國條件，故即使談和平亦不妨”。白徐唐等亦均表贊成，然蔣於日後以和平條件告以某國，蔣即聽從某國意見，而採取行動。</p>
<p>蔣介石爲何如此，是否受宋子文宋美齡慫恿，亦不得而知。但總之這與在滿洲事變中，引入國際聯盟的方法，如出一轍，徒然增大外國在東亞的發言權，此決非標榜獨立自主的政府所應採取之態度。又　他國干涉外交，始終處於隸屬的地位，他國之一顰一笑，不得不依，本國政策被他國所左右，雖然彼等口稱希望國民奮起，然結果　使論於殖民地人民的不幸境地。</p>
<p>重慶爲何對日宣戰</p>
<p>中國事變亦可稱爲大東亞戰爭的內亂，並不如對英美之戰爭。日本未曾對重慶宣戰，直至日本對英美宣戰時，依然未對重慶宣戰，蓋中日兩國並非如他人之夥伴間之吵架，實爲兄弟圍牆之爭。</p>
<p>但重慶於大東亞戰爭爆發後，立即對日宣戰，過去四年以上未曾宣戰，而經過四年半後，再行宣戰，果何言也，餘以爲不出受英美之壓力而已。</p>
<p>重慶對日宣戰，則將如何？此即說世界戰爭可在中國大陸上進行，易言之，英美不必向重慶招呼而可自由使用重慶領土爲作戰基地，重慶不可拒絕重慶之領土，成爲日本對英美作戰的戰場，結果中國民衆受慘重損害。現在進行中之大陸作戰，自日本言，爲自衛上之不得已之措置，而於中國民衆，誠爲遺憾。此種結果，不得不歸咎於重慶方面外交政策之失策，大部分責任應由彼等負擔。</p>
<p>結論　不保持東亞人面目者爲誰？去年有人來自重慶，餘曾詢問曰：“當君獲悉日本軍在珍珠　擊滅美海軍，在馬來海而擊沈英國戰船二艘，曾作如何感想耶？”彼即答曰：“重慶大部分人感到愉快，認爲英美與吾人間不是沒有極大差別的。”吾人亦抱有好似重慶方面人士同樣之感情，　以爲畢竟“血比水濃厚”。觀乎最近狀況重慶受英美壓迫而改變其政策之事　，不一而足。茲舉一列以言之，英美　說“中國之命運”一書，內容是全體主義的，且排外主義的，故須加以修正，或曰五五憲法草案，不合於英美之民主主義，須加修改，且早日予以實施，甚至稱重慶若能聽任共産黨主張，表示讓步。而宋子文以次所謂“媚美派”之輩，寧願犧牲國民而附從英美，誠不知其存心何在也。吾人再觀開羅會議的結果，英美連朝鮮與台灣之問題，亦曾被提出，當時曾談上協議，如不解決此問題，戰事將永遠繼續進行，此實爲使阻撓中日和平之進行，使中日永遠成仇敵之惡毒陰謀。然重慶對此會談結果，極表興奮，　不知已受英美利用，此輩實已喪失東亞之本來面目，　　本性亦成爲英美奴隸。誤國者爲誰，自有後世中華民族加以裁判，歷史當可證明之。</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 岩田豐雄著　洋譯</p>
<p>櫻與錨（五）</p>
<p>（這一定是先生作出來的事。）</p>
<p>隆夫突然想到這裏，而覺感非常慚愧，於是便想立刻跑到市來　家去道歉。</p>
<p>他迅速穿好衣服，就到洗足去了。事實，果如他所推測。</p>
<p>“不，我最初就想把那張畫送到文展去的。但仔細一想，軍艦畫對於文展是稍微不合适的，又加上我是審查員，所以按事實就對你不利了。”</p>
<p>市來畫家對於隆夫那種把畫置之理，而對於長輩無理的情形，似乎毫不注意的樣子，同時對於自己特意命令　童隆夫的畫送去展覽，也不表示誇功。</p>
<p>“因爲近來你不來，所以並未徴求你的同意，就交給展覽會了。固然還算不上著名的展覽會，但有海軍大臣的賞賜，總算略堪告慰。有了金星賞，就好了。”</p>
<p>隆夫聽到這樣輕描淡寫的話，反而覺著非常　羞。於是深深地體味到老師的恩德了。</p>
<p>“你乘此機會，回一次老家怎樣呢？可以說衣錦歸鄉了。或許在麓兒島縣，得到海軍大臣賞的文展特選，就是你一個人。這樣就可以讓你父親不再擔心你了。”</p>
<p>“是。”</p>
<p>隆夫很高興就接受了這個勸告。</p>
<p>當天在畫家家裏吃晚飯後，興高采烈地回高圓寺去了。</p>
<p>第二天早晨一看報紙，在社會欄的一角上刊登著他海國展覽會得獎的名字。縱令許多讀者會馬虎過去這個消息，但在隆夫的眼裏，卻像紀念塔般地映現出來了。</p>
<p>（平生第一次被世人知道了。）</p>
<p>熱淚從眼框裏迸流出來，而用指甲揩去。</p>
<p>他甚至早飯也不吃，就跑到日本橋百貨商店的會塲去了。　衆尚不到兩三個人。他跑到自己的畫旁邊，像石像般地在畫前邊佇立著。面孔有點發紅，腳部在跳躍，而並覺不出是在看畫。過了片刻，精神一鎮靜，而大臣賞這樣字條，就映入眼簾了。自己看出來有很多缺點，本應當還畫得好一些。他並不知道這是證明，是比半年前畫畫時進步了。</p>
<p>（如果是現在，我　不這樣畫。）</p>
<p>他表示著失　的嘆息，但當發現畫框是市來畫家的愛用品時，就不禁滿腔充滿了感謝的成份。（一一四）</p>

<h3>"Making a Mountain Out of a Molehill"</h3>
<p>— Yoshida Tosuke</p>
<p>I recently encountered such a thing. The apartment I live in is managed by a large Japanese national policy company. Recently, in order to save electricity, it greatly shortened the use time of the elevators. As a result, two of the three elevator operators hired were dismissed. However, the severance pay for drivers with more than three years of service was only two-thirds of one month's salary. According to previous practice, the severance pay for this apartment would be set at two months' salary. However, the new manager, the national policy company, disregarded the usual practice and paid the dismissed employees one-third of one month's salary. When the drivers negotiated with them, the person in charge looked stern and scolded, "Get out!" What's more, the Japanese supervisor specially dispatched by the company even punched the old man twice. This kind of lawless phenomenon can really be said to be unheard of. I dare to ask this Japanese, late at night, to ask himself, would the Japanese have such a wild act towards the wood-like people all day long? The reason why Japanese people have such a fierce attitude towards Chinese people is nothing more than that Japanese people have a wrong view that since the other party is Chinese, they can be buried at will. Empress Dowager Cixi sighed: "They (Westerners) look down on us only because they think we are just Chinese." (From "Two Years in the Forbidden City" by [unclear]). In the final analysis, this Japanese is really the same as those Westerners who do not recognize Chinese people as human beings. As long as the Japanese have such erroneous thoughts and absurd behaviors, no matter how flowery and grand the Japanese government's declarations are, the Chinese people will not sincerely accept them.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the spirit that currently dominates China is to inherit the consistent fine traditions of the Xinhai Revolution. The Xinhai Revolution, of course, was superficially a "national revolution against the Manchu Qing," but the so-called "Manchu" had long been assimilated by the Han Chinese, and it can also be said that the Manchu's ruling relationship with the Han Chinese had long disappeared. Therefore, the launch of the Xinhai Revolution was by no means caused by the irreconcilable hatred of the Han people towards the Manchus. So what was the real motivation for the Xinhai Revolution? In fact, due to the international environment at that time, as long as one was considered Chinese, one would be looked down upon by foreigners. The Xinhai Revolution broke out against this point. The Chinese people rose up in anger, wanting to lay a strong foundation for China and get rid of this humiliating environment. But the Chinese people all noticed that the Manchu Qing government did not have the guiding force of a world-class country like the Japanese government guiding Japan. Therefore, in order to first remove the obstacle in the process, the Manchu Qing government, they launched the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, as Gu Hongming said, the Xinhai Revolution was a "people's revolution against the government that tolerated foreigners' insults to the Chinese people." To be more precise, it was "not a revolution against a corrupt government, but a revolution against a weak or cowardly government." At present, the fundamental traditional spirit of this national revolution is still being carried forward in China. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, after several efforts and struggles, it has tried to jump out of the bad environment where it is insulted by people all over the world just because it is Chinese, and wants to create a good environment where it is respected by people all over the world just because it is Chinese. Anyone who hinders the Chinese people's demand for Taoism is regarded by the Chinese people as the evil enemy of the Chinese nation, and anyone who supports this demand is regarded as the comrade-in-arms of the Chinese nation. Therefore, the above-mentioned insulting attitude of a large Japanese national policy company towards the employment of Chinese people, although the matter is small, is greatly contrary to the fundamental beliefs of the Chinese people. Therefore, no matter how loudly the Japanese government shouts out new policies, and no matter how many beautiful theories the Japanese publish in newspapers and magazines, as long as the Chinese people find that the Japanese people's wrong views on the Chinese people have not changed in their daily lives, in other words, as long as they are beaten, scolded, and insulted by the Japanese people just because they are Chinese, then the Japanese should not expect the Chinese people to recognize Japan as a friendly country of China.</p>
<p>I heard that there is a story in Chongqing recently. Namely: An American airplane pilot was drunk, with a cigarette in his mouth, and staggered on the right side of the road. Smoking cigarettes on the road and walking on the right side are not allowed by the New Life Movement, but the police did not dare to stop him because the other party was American. At this time, a young military officer happened to pass by the place, so he severely criticized the American, saying: "This is Chinese territory, so you must abide by Chinese laws." In this way, the Chinese people certainly have no special ambition to put on airs towards other countries, but they will never allow foreigners living in China to look down on the Chinese people. Although China is currently divided into peaceful areas and resistance areas, the requirements of all Chinese people are only one. Therefore, it must be known that the insult of a large Japanese national policy company to the Chinese people will not only have a bad impact on the Chinese people in the peaceful areas, but also have a bad impact on the Chinese people in the resistance areas.

<h3>Enemy Ships in the Central Pacific Sunk and Destroyed Exceed Fifty; Japanese Troops on Saipan Continue to Fight Fiercely</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific, Central News Agency dispatch dated the 11th of June: Since the enemy appeared in the Mariana Sea area on June 11th, the Japanese army, navy, and air force have fought bravely and well. As of the 20th, they have shot down or destroyed more than 40 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, and other ships, inflicting great damage on the enemy. It has been clarified that on the nights of June 18th and 19th, two enemy aircraft carriers were sunk near Saipan, for a total of two ships. It has been confirmed that they have been sunk. Therefore, the actual number of enemy ships sunk or damaged in the Mariana Sea area and the Ogasawara area from June 1st to 30th has reached more than 50.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: A dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the Central Pacific states that the Japanese troops on Saipan are still fighting fiercely under the two-pronged attack of the enemy's sea, land, and air forces. On the 5th, they launched a fierce battle in the area extending approximately six kilometers south from Tero Cape, the northern end of the island. Afterwards, the Japanese army shortened and reorganized the front line to the north, and are currently continuing to fight fiercely. On the other hand, a strong Japanese army assault force slipped into the enemy's position near Mount Tapochau and carried out a surprise attack, throwing the enemy into confusion. The Japanese Air Force also echoed the brave fighting of the ground forces, bombing the enemy troops on the island on the night of the 6th. On the night of the 7th, they braved enemy anti-aircraft fire to bomb the area around Aslito airfield. In this battle, the Japanese aircraft returned after bombing. It has been determined that the battle in the Tero Cape area at the northern end of the island is very fierce. Near the foot of Mount Tapochau, the enemy army is constantly firing flares and is currently engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese assault force.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Re-attack Kyushu; Repelled Again with Ease; Japan's Homeland Defense as Solid as an Iron Wall</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 AM on July 8th: At around 2:00 AM on the 8th, more than ten enemy aircraft infiltrated the western and northern areas of Kyushu from a mainland base. The Japanese air defense forces immediately intercepted them and repelled them. The Japanese side suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The enemy army attempted a second air raid on Northern Kyushu at dawn on the 8th, but was defeated again by the Japanese army. In this battle, the enemy army first divided into three squadrons of several aircraft each. One squadron invaded the Nagasaki and Sasebo areas from the western sea and fled towards the Genkai Sea in the north. The other two squadrons took the same route as last time, invading the Northern Kyushu industrial zone from the north. One squadron turned east and fled north over Yamaguchi Prefecture, while the other squadron retreated west and fled to the Genkai Sea. The Japanese side had completely prepared for the interception about an hour before the enemy aircraft appeared, especially because of the second attack, the preparations were extremely rapid. The enemy aircraft's aim in this air raid seemed to be to bomb the Northern Kyushu industrial zone and the naval areas of Omura and Sasebo. During their attacks, they tried to avoid using bombs and mainly used incendiary bombs. What is particularly noteworthy is that, as of 8:00 AM, according to the report transmitted to this agency by the North Kyushu branch of the Domei News Agency, it has been confirmed that three enemy aircraft were shot down. Most of the incendiary bombs used by the enemy army this time did not explode. Those that did burn were completely extinguished due to the dispatch of fire brigades and the courageous rescue efforts of neighborhood fire prevention teams. As far as is known now, only two or three private houses in cities such as Kokura City and Tobata City were destroyed, and there were no casualties. This is truly a great ironclad proof that civilian air defense has been successful. Furthermore, according to reports from the Nagasaki, Sasebo, and Omura branches, the enemy aircraft that attacked these areas were one squadron composed of five to seven aircraft. However, no enemy bombs fell in any of the areas. Bombs were only dropped in the sea southwest of Nagasaki City. When the Japanese air defense forces pursued them, one B25 aircraft was shot down off the coast of Shisa Town, Nagasaki Prefecture. The enemy's air raid on that area also ended in failure.</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima Issues Statement</p>
<p>Minister Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Press Department in China issued a statement yesterday, saying: According to the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters, the enemy American air force stationed in Chongqing attempted to attack our homeland Northern Kyushu and Western Kyushu again with B29 bombers. However, our air defense forces detected the enemy aircraft's movements in advance and immediately rose up to intercept them, repelling the enemy's air raid force, which relied solely on material quantity, while our side's damage was negligible.</p>
<p>The enemy Americans have recently suffered unexpected and heavy losses in their operations in the Pacific. For example, in the Ogasawara Islands area, as announced on the 4th, over seventy-four attacking enemy aircraft were shot down, and the remnants fled in a panic. Also, in the Saipan area, as of June 30th, the total number of enemy ships sunk or destroyed was over forty-eight, and the number of enemy aircraft shot down reached over six hundred and sixty-six.</p>
<p>The enemy, feeling impatient about this, seeing that the Chongqing army has suffered major blows in the Japanese army's mainland operations, to the extent that Wallace's blank check is also difficult to use, is now trying to air raid the Japanese homeland in order to achieve their goal.</p>
<p>Although the enemy aircraft have already been defeated and fled, considering that today's enemy aircraft's actions in the Central China area are related to the air raids on the Japanese homeland, we must still be strictly vigilant.</p>
<p>Looking at the recent situation in which the United States, regardless of sacrifice, is gradually falling into a hot spot, it can be judged. For example, the American Undersecretary of the Navy once said, "This war will last until 1949," and was therefore regarded as incompetent, and there was talk of "dismissal," which is just one example. Even if the enemy Americans increase their quality and quantity and repeatedly air raid, we will not care. If they come to invade, we will definitely destroy them anytime, anywhere. We will not stop intercepting them for a day until they lose their will to fight and their combat power.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Reinforce and Attack Near Qingyuan; Japanese Aircraft Vigorously Bomb Hengyang Chongqing Troops</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing Reserve 10th Division and the Provisional 54th Division in Hengyang City, although they have become rats in a bag, are still stubbornly resisting. In order to completely annihilate them, the Japanese bomber squadrons carried out a major bombing on them on the evening of the 6th. That night, the weather was clear and the moon was bright. The Japanese aircraft squadrons that killed to the skies over Hengyang aimed at the enemy army headquarters in the northern end of the city, and the houses and city walls where the remnants of the enemy were gathered, and dropped huge bombs. As a result, flames suddenly soared into the sky and black smoke filled the area in Hengyang City, as if it were hell. The entire Japanese aircraft squadron flew back safely.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a Chongqing dispatch, the Chongqing military authorities are still continuing to fight fiercely around Hengyang. On the 5th, the Japanese army supplied a large amount of weapons and ammunition by airplane and fiercely bombed the Chongqing army's positions. The infantry then carried out a strong assault under this cover. The attack continued on the night of the 6th, and the Chongqing army also worked hard to defend. On the Guangdong front, the Japanese army near Qingyuan, having obtained reinforcements from all sides, is attacking the Chongqing army's positions again.</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on the Chinese War</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to a London dispatch, the diplomatic correspondent of the Observer, on the 5th, specially selected the following events of the Japanese operation in China: After occupying Changsha and passing through Hengyang, the Japanese army is currently advancing south. The Chongqing side has lost important transportation lines and granaries due to the Japanese army's advance. This has a great impact on military affairs and the economy. Especially in military affairs, it will deepen the suffering of the Chongqing people who have been through wars. Furthermore, the increasingly isolated Chongqing side will deepen the atmosphere of the people's participation in the war. Due to the Chongqing side's loss of fertile areas, the Chongqing area has fallen into a state of famine, and its economic and financial position has become exceptionally weak, etc. Furthermore, the Manchester Guardian also criticized the difficulty of rescue, saying that Chongqing is now in the most severe period of testing. Because the anti-axis countries cannot provide a large amount of materials to aid Chongqing, Chongqing, which has been feeling economic pressure for a long time, will soon lose the rich rice-producing areas of southeastern China.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Discusses the Chinese War Situation</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Washington dispatch, US President Roosevelt met with a group of newspaper reporters on the 7th and issued a statement saying: The recent war situation on the Chinese front is worrying. The Chongqing army cannot stop the Japanese army's advance. The general American people do not understand the seriousness of the actual situation in China. If Chongqing is completely defeated, then the Japanese-American war will tend to be prolonged.</p>
<h3>The Battle on the Myitkyina Front in Burma is Currently Unfolding Fiercely; Japanese Elite Troops Destroy Enemy's Attempt</h3>
<p>Japanese frontline in North Burma, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Chongqing-British-American Allied Forces are currently invading near Kamaning on the Myitkyina front. Relying on manpower and material quantity, they have attempted to link up with the Yunnan Expeditionary Force that crossed the Salween River after occupying Myitkyina and Mogaung, and have repeatedly attacked. In order to destroy the enemy's intention, the Japanese army has launched a fierce battle with them with elite troops. The enemy's military strength is gradually weakening. From November last year to June this year, the number of enemy soldiers killed or wounded, surrendered and fled, and captured totaled more than 36,000. Taking a certain division of the Chongqing army stationed in India as an example, the damage before June has reached 1,786 people, of which 30% were killed in battle, and about half of the officers were killed. Therefore, the commanders feel that they are insufficient, and because of the Chongqing-British-American cooperative relationship, the command system has fallen into confusion, so it has a great impact on the operation.</p>
<h3>Tokyo and Other Cities Decide to Evacuate School Children</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Recently, Tokyo and other important cities in Japan have been strengthening defenses. Previously, the Japanese government had considered evacuation plans for the protection of schoolchildren. It has now decided on a guiding policy and will implement it soon. The Japanese Information Bureau issued the following statement on the 8th regarding this matter: The government has decided on a guiding policy regarding the evacuation of schoolchildren from Tokyo and other important cities. It is now actively considering specific plans and will implement them soon. The evacuation of schoolchildren will avoid compulsory implementation and will be based on encouragement as a principle. It will actively encourage evacuation to the residences of close relatives. For those who do not have suitable relatives or friends, a group evacuation will be implemented according to plan under the management of the government. The students who should be evacuated as a group are stipulated to be students from the second grade and above to the sixth grade of elementary school in national schools. The evacuation locations should be selected as much as possible in locations with convenient transportation to and from their families. After the evacuation is completed, the current teachers will have to go to continue teaching, and food and other necessities must be prepared and stored. The details will be announced soon.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Implements Reform: Decisive Battle Local Administration; Setting Up Full-Time Vice-Minister of Air Defense Headquarters</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to revitalize the local administration during the decisive battle, and especially in order to increase production in industrial and economic administration, the Japanese government had previously carefully examined this matter and decided on a concrete plan at a cabinet meeting on the 4th. The official gazette was published on the 8th and it was decided that it would be implemented from today. The main points of the publication are as follows: Set up a full-time vice-minister at the Air Defense General Headquarters; Consolidate and strengthen the local administrative structure; The economic departments of the prefectural governments and counties will implement a two-department system; Consolidate the local labor administration structure. In the past, the position of vice-minister of the Air Defense General Headquarters was held by the minister, who devoted himself to the post. This time, it has been changed to a full-time position to assist the Minister of Home Affairs and devote himself to air defense countermeasures. Regarding the strengthening of local administrative structures, vice-ministers will first be set up in the three major important prefectures and counties of Osaka, Fukuoka, and Aichi to assist the prefectural governors and county chiefs and be responsible for the comprehensive operation of local administration. The so-called two-department system of economic affairs: the first department is in charge of food. General industrial economic administration and civil engineering related matters other than administrative food are under the control of the second department, and it is the central district for external liaison for military demand and production increase in order to smooth economic administration. Furthermore, in view of the importance of labor administration in the current situation, the organizational structure of the Ministry of Health and Welfare's labor department is strengthened. Labor departments are set up in the Metropolitan Police Department and the Police Bureau to specialize in the management of labor administration in order to make the national labor and labor allocation more streamlined. Regarding the revitalization of local administration, since the establishment of the Administrative Council in July last year, the results have gradually progressed. After this new reform, it will definitely achieve the expected results.</p>
<h3>Bose Unveils True Feelings to Gandhi</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: On the 6th, Bose unveiled his true feelings to Gandhi on the radio, saying in essence: Gandhi, India's dawn is getting closer and closer, so my two major convictions recently are getting stronger and stronger, that is, the opportunity to liberate the divinely endowed motherland has come, and it is definitely not a difficult thing to succeed. Secondly, in order to expel the British, one must borrow external forces. Your Excellency also knows very well that it is impossible to achieve results against the cunning British government by relying solely on morality and non-violence. Now the intention of the British government is to extract our bones. Therefore, what we should strive to do is to cultivate the Indian people's fierce anti-British strife and assistance from the struggle for India. The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a good opportunity for India to unite and obtain assistance from the Axis powers. The Japanese have fully considered that the assistance of third countries is contrary to what the British have publicized. I believe that this kind of assistance is absolutely beneficial to India.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Mizuno Cables Congratulations to Bose</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Central News Agency dispatch: Japanese Taisei Yokusankai Kōa Honbu Prime Minister Mizuno, on the occasion of the "Independence League Week" sponsored by the Immediate Independence League, specially sent a congratulatory telegram to Chairman [Bose] to wish free India to achieve independence immediately.</p>

Subsequently, the head of the Ba Han delegation delivered a reply, stating that they had visited Japan and Manchukuo and were deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of the governments and people of each country. It is an honor to receive the warm hospitality of all circles in your country.

Our Chairman sent a telegram to Governor Ba Maw, expressing a warm welcome to the delegation and wishing to provide them with the greatest convenience. The original telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Governor Ba Maw, National Representative of Myanmar, Dr. Ba Han, Head of the Special Investigation Group, and all members have arrived in our capital on the 6th.

I respectfully reiterate my respect to Your Excellency, the National Representative. Wang Zhaoming, Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Director Lin's Broadcast to Chongqing: "Striving for a Proactive Way Out" (Continued)</h3>
<p>The second question, "How should we handle the possible changes in the political situation caused by the European war situation?" After this question was raised, it seems that Chongqing has already started to deal with it, so there are exchanges between Chongqing and Moscow, and Wallace's visit. In fact, this kind of handling is more passive than active. We want to ask Chongqing to pay attention and not be fooled again, and have their own country exploited by others for nothing.</p>
<p>The third question that was asked at that time was, "How should we cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and the European War stages, seize the critical moment, and strive for the only possible and favorable solution? Is it going to end up unresolved, and be controlled by others in a state of neither war nor peace?" There will naturally be different views on this issue. Some people think that since we have been fighting for six or seven years anyway, why not drag it on a little longer and wait and see. Some people think that the outcome of the victory or defeat is still unknown. Even if the United Kingdom and the United States lose, they will never be destroyed. It is more cost-effective to be with the United Kingdom and the United States. This is simply the inferiority of being a slave to the United Kingdom and the United States. It can be said that "right and wrong are unclear, and interests are indistinguishable." Leaving aside the fact that the United Kingdom and the United States will lose, even if the United Kingdom and the United States win, based on the past events of the United Kingdom and the United States dominating the world for three or four hundred years, wouldn't China become meat on the chopping block at that time? The interests here are obvious. As for right and wrong, the allied nation of Japan has repeatedly stated the significance of the Greater East Asia War and is willing to be friends with China and not enemies. Why be enemies?</p>
<p>The fourth question that was asked at that time was, "The Communist Party has become a prairie fire. Should we allow it to sit idly by and watch China not perish from the disastrous defeat of the war, not perish from the failure of peace, but perish from the Communist Party taking advantage of the fire?" Regarding this issue, the Kuomintang comrades in Chongqing and other people must know it more deeply and anxiously than we do. Putting aside the friendship with other countries, as well as the Communist Party's theory and political propositions, just in terms of the practical issues, the Communist Party's strategy of resisting Chiang Kai-shek by force and the Communist Party's plan to launch a civil war before the end of the war abroad, the Communist Party's anti-Japanese strategy of restraining Chiang Kai-shek with democratic movements, and then limiting Chiang Kai-shek's power, and then obtaining strong international power and triggering the outbreak of the anti-Chiang movement, are all the Communist Party's propaganda outlines. The secret agents in Chongqing should have very detailed reports to Mr. Chiang. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Clarifies Key Points for Collecting Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The central education authorities stipulate that from the next academic year, in order to improve the salaries of teachers and staff, all schools at all levels, except for normal schools, must collect tuition fees. The Ministry of Education has clarified the key points for collecting tuition fees as follows: Education is a national undertaking, and efforts should be made to reduce the cost of education for the people. However, at present, the general salaries cannot be increased along with prices, and the salaries of teachers are even more meager. It is indeed necessary to use tuition fees to provide temporary stability to the lives of teachers. In recent years, price changes have been unpredictable. The cost of living in Area A and Area B are vastly different. The amount of tuition fees should not be uniformly restricted. Each province and city should consider the actual situation and the needs of the schools, formulate standards, and implement the collection after approval. After collecting tuition fees, each school must still set up free places to accommodate poor students, children of education and cultural workers, and children of low-level civil servants, so as not to be deprived of education due to inability to pay fees.</p>
<h3>German Army Actively Reinforces: Caen Area Falls into Melee; US Army Launches Large-Scale Offensive on Sanlo</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to German front-line news: In the twelve-kilometer continuous arc-shaped battle line in the Caen area, the two armies have a total of 100,000 troops and 2,000 tanks, and are currently entering a close-quarters melee.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters field correspondent, the German army continued to reinforce its troops to the Caen area from the southeast on the evening of the 6th.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Haitong News Agency report, British sources said that the British army launched an offensive southwest of Caen at 4:30 AM this morning, and it is reported that the US army on the Carentan-La Haye front has advanced to one mile north of Saint-Jean-de-Daye. It is also said that the US army's bridgehead in Villers has expanded to one mile wide and two and a half miles long. It is also learned that the battle of La Haye-du-Puits has now evolved into an artillery battle, with the German army in an advantageous position. At the extreme southern end, the US army has advanced to Mobeck, two miles southwest of La Haye.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: The US army on the Cotentin Peninsula launched a large-scale offensive in the direction of Sanlo yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: Although the British and American armies fought with superior troops on Thursday, they failed to penetrate the German line everywhere, and there was no progress on the positions, which could be used as a prelude to a major offensive. The German army had to abandon its positions and retreat north in some places, but the units did not lose contact with each other and were still able to control the situation everywhere. The anti-axis forces have begun new operations south of Arezzo, and it is expected that large-scale offensives will continue in the area. The British and Polish forces launched a strong offensive in the Adriatic region. After several hours of fierce fighting near Osimo and Filottrano, the enemy broke through several gaps at a heavy price. The fighting in each gap was still ongoing on Friday morning.</p>
<h3>Declaration of War by the National Government</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the year before last, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Basic Treaty between China and Japan, declared its determination to share weal and woe with the friendly nation of Japan. Since then, it has launched a new national movement, engaged in safeguarding security and improving people's livelihood, with the aim of enhancing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States still use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia and have become even more aggressive. They have even colluded with elements in Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Myanmar and India to make East Asians kill each other. Recently, because their forces have been successively defeated by the friendly Japanese army, navy, and air force, and the bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become more cunning. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the areas under the rule of the National Government, and they have incited elements in Chongqing to constantly harass us in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and they have even used their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing, who are willing to be driven by the United Kingdom and the United States and become traitors to East Asia, are indeed shameful. However, the United Kingdom and the United States have been scheming against East Asia for a long time, doing their best to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation. This is something that the East Asian nations should hate together. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with the United Kingdom and the United States. It will do its best to cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to eliminate the brutality of the United Kingdom and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The countries of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained good relations and have the same heart for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the future, we will work together to build a new East Asian order based on morality. The allied nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States in the West for many years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to make a contribution to the just new order of the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Greater Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of faith, peace in the entire world, depend on this. Let us work together with one heart and one mind to carry out the great mission of this great era!</p>
<p>January 9, 1942, Chairman, Wang Zhaoming</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Summer Offensive: Focus Shifts South; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Northern Wing of the Central Route</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: The characteristic of the Eastern Front battles on Thursday was the southward spread of defensive battles. The Soviet army began operations in Kovel, Lutsk, and Ternopol, and its scope has exceeded the nature of the usual scout-type fragmented offensives. The operations west of Kovel and Lutsk advanced under the cover of a tank army brigade. A gap was broken through west of Lutsk, but was closed by a German counterattack. The Soviet command apparently wanted to expand its offensive to various areas of the southern front. The battles that occurred near Kovel, Lutsk, and Ternopol are probably the first step in this trend. The defensive battles in the central route are still concentrated in the old focal points, and the battle for the Baranavichy isthmus southeast of Vilnius and northwest of Lake Neroch is particularly fierce. The German defenders are concentrated on the eastern border of the city, and the Soviet army has repeatedly attempted to launch a flanking encirclement strategy, but was blocked by the German army. The battle south of Slutsk is particularly fierce, and the German line retreated to the forest area near Khotsyn. Fierce fighting also took place near Smolyany on Thursday. The Soviet army attempted to break through under the cover of motorized formations, but was repulsed. Two German bridgeheads on the south bank of the Dvina River were abandoned. The Soviet army repeatedly attempted to defeat the German positions north and northwest of Polotsk with concentrated riflemen and tank army formations, but the results collapsed under the German defensive artillery fire.</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Launch Large-Scale Attack on Germany, 77 Shot Down</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced that US heavy bombers, escorted by a strong fighter fleet, attacked central and southeastern Germany on the morning of the 7th. As a result of the air battle, 77 US aircraft were shot down.</p>
<h3>17,000 Killed in French Air Raids Last Month</h3>
<p>Paris, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: A total of 17,233 people in France were killed in air raids last month.</p>
<h3>Two More German Generals Sacrifice for Their Country</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency) - According to a Haitong News Agency report: On June 23, the day General Dietl died in a plane crash in Finland, two other German generals also passed away on the same day. German newspapers announced last night that German Infantry General Wigot and Mountain Infantry General Egerqi died in an accident. General Wigot was famous for the Battle of the Dyansk Fortress, and General Egerqi was credited with fighting in the Caucasus Mountains. The details of the deaths of the two men are unknown.</p>
<h3>A Report on Mr. Chen Youren</h3>
<p>— Li Weichen</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Now that Mr. Chen has passed away, the immediate matters to be dealt with are the funeral arrangements and burial. Because the handling of these two matters is related to Mr. Chen's wishes and will, I should also briefly report on the process and disclose his will.</p>
<p>Half an hour after Mr. Chen's death, we discussed his funeral arrangements in his study. At that time, there was a proposal to temporarily place Mr. Chen's remains in Shanghai, and after the war, move them to Wuhan, which would permanently symbolize his involvement in the war, his meritorious service, and the lively and creative era of the Chinese revolution. But Madam Chen did not agree. She calmly said to us: "My husband often told me that if he died, I should cremate his body, without extravagance, without erecting a monument, and scatter his ashes in the ocean, into the vast emptiness." She also told us: The funeral should be based on her husband's simple and unadorned habits during his lifetime, and the burial clothes should be the same blue robe that he usually wore and that his friends were familiar with. The appearance of the deceased should not be altered, the cremation should be held as soon as possible, and all customary rituals should be avoided. All flower wreaths and elegiac couplets should be declined. We had to follow Madam Chen's opinion. According to this will, everyone discussed until about four o'clock before dispersing, with only Ms. Zhang Yunying staying to accompany Madam Chen. I silently sat alone in the study.</p>
<p>Around five ten, Mr. Chen Fumu, a friend who did not often meet Mr. Chen but always appeared in times of trouble, rushed over. He lingered and looked at the deceased's face for a long time, shaking his head, unable to say anything, only expressing his willingness to help with everything and provide his car for funeral use. In today's lack of transportation, this is rare.</p>
<p>Originally, it was agreed to send the body to the funeral home around six o'clock, but Madam Chen ordered to delay it a little longer, and then, in tears, stood in front of the couch and drew a final sketch of her husband. The scene at that time and her state of mind cannot be described with words. Please forgive me for not being able to depict it.</p>
<p>About ten minutes later, Mr. Chen Fumu and I took a carriage in the faint morning light, with the wind whistling and the rain drizzling, and accompanied Mr. Chen's body to the International Funeral Home.</p>
<p>Around nine o'clock, Mr. Yan Junren and Mr. Ze Hanliang both came to the funeral home and gave a lot of guidance on everything. It was at that time that it was decided to hold the simplest ceremony at the Jing'an Temple Auditorium at three o'clock on the afternoon of the 22nd, followed by cremation.</p>
<p>Around ten fifteen, Madam Chen arrived. Many friends also came and sincerely expressed their willingness to help. Because the cremation procedure requires the court to examine the body first, and that day was Saturday, and the court did not usually work in the afternoon. Fortunately, Mr. Chen Binhe enthusiastically ran around and pleaded with the court to send someone to inspect it immediately, otherwise, I am afraid that the cremation on the 22nd would not be in time. The ceremony held on the 22nd has been recorded in various newspapers, so I don't need to report it in detail. I can only say that this ceremony was extremely simple. Dr. Huang Hanxiang announced the start of the ceremony, and Dr. Yan Junren gave a brief eulogy. It goes without saying that Mr. Yan's words were moving. From his experience of 33 years of friendship, he very humbly, fairly, and appropriately spoke about Mr. Chen's knowledge, ambition, and especially emphasized his spirit of loving the country. If I were to strictly analyze Mr. Yan's entire eulogy in detail, the only thing I could disagree with is one sentence. This point will be reserved for later when explaining Mr. Chen's words, actions, and thoughts.</p>
<p>In addition, those who came to pay their respects on that day included not only Mr. Chen's friends but also people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign. General Kawamoto, the Japanese Shanghai Army Commander, also came in person to pay his respects and expressed his condolences to Madam Chen, saying that if there were any difficulties, he would provide convenience as much as possible. This kind of sincere sympathy is a moral principle that cannot be ignored. In addition, a German consultant who was once prominent under General Chiang Kai-shek and several Soviet and French writers also came to pay their last respects.</p>
<p>But the most moving thing was an old woman from the countryside. She came staggering before the ceremony, bowed her hands together to the coffin, and then quietly left. Another was a former soldier who had seen Mr. Chen in some occasions. He actually ran from Suzhou that day and asked me to give him "errands." Later, I gave him money for food, but he firmly refused and said to me: "Little brother, I respect Minister Chen. If I take money for food, it is not respect." After Mr. Chen passed away, I had no tears, but the earnestness and moving attitude of this former soldier made me unable to restrain myself, and my tears welled up in my eyes.</p>
<p>There was also a Japanese soldier. During the ceremony, he actually started to cry and sobbed uncontrollably. If there had been music that day, it would not have been surprising to see tears, but there was none that day. He had no acquaintance with Mr. Chen, so of course there was no relationship to speak of. He was probably a young Japanese intellectual. How touching were his tears that transcended national borders and the atmosphere of war!</p>
<p>Finally, the grief revealed by the young people when they paid their respects to the deceased was an emotional and rational grief. They represent the young generation of China. I want to say to them: Mr. Chen has always been looking forward to you, and he is still looking forward to you, the young people of China!</p>
<p>Many friends were concerned about the funeral expenses because Mr. Chen had always been honest and self-disciplined. I must state here that this time, because the person in charge of the funeral home admired Mr. Chen's personality, they were particularly polite. The cremation and all expenses only cost 25,000 yuan. Therefore, the total funeral expenses did not exceed 30,000 yuan. I must also state that although the generous gifts sent by friends were well-intentioned, most of them were returned. This is how I had to handle it based on my understanding of Mr. Chen. If this offends anyone, I am sorry.</p>
<p>The report on the funeral is now at an end.</p>
<p>Now I should report on Mr. Chen's will. As mentioned above, Mr. Chen's will was to "scatter his ashes in the ocean, returning them to the vast emptiness," but after the will was found, it was learned that Mr. Chen had made some revisions to this point. He advocated that his ashes be "scattered in China's great rivers or along the coast," he was forever nostalgic for his motherland! He will always protect China's rivers and seas.</p>
<p>The following is a translation of the will:</p>
<p>"This is my last will and testament. My name is Chen Youren, also known as Eugene Chen; my wife's name is Chen Liying or Chen Zhang Liying, also known as Georgette Chen. All that I currently own or will own in the future, or own at the time of my death, regardless of the type or nature of the property or personal belongings, I hereby grant, bequeath, and devise entirely to my wife.</p>
<p>"I declare as follows: Only my wife may represent me in using my name and speaking on my behalf; only my wife may make statements, deny, or refute anything that belongs to or concerns me, and that pertains to my reputation and name; my wife has full power to dispose of my body in any manner and method she deems appropriate, including cremating my body and scattering my ashes in China's great rivers or along the coast.</p>
<p>"I also declare: I am purely Chinese. Both my father and mother were registered in Guangdong. I also want everyone to know that I reject and do not recognize any kinship or family relationship with anyone, male or female, who is not of pure Chinese blood. If anyone dares to object, I hereby entrust my wife to uphold my original intention. If my wife takes any action or lawsuit for this purpose, I earnestly request all my friends, whether Chinese or other people of yellow race, to assist and support my wife. Established in Shanghai on November 26, 1942, Chen Youren (Eugene Chen)."</p>
<p>This is Mr. Chen's will, and it is of course completely different in nature from the will he dictated to me at the Hong Kong Hotel as mentioned above. That will does not need to be disclosed now and can only be locked deep in my heart for my appreciation and as a clear mirror for me to refer to when I encounter difficulties.</p>
<p>Regarding the will published above, I should also make some clarifications.</p>
<p>One: The original will is in English. English legal documents do not seek to be detailed but to be clear. Therefore, many words and phrases with seemingly repetitive meanings but with slight differences are used. When I translated it, I had to follow the style of the original text, hoping to preserve the original appearance, but the conciseness of the original wording and the beauty of the sentences are beyond my translation.</p>
<p>Two: Mr. Chen clearly stated in his will that only his wife can represent him, use his name, and speak on his behalf. I would like to draw the attention of those who are now falsely using Mr. Chen's name to engage in activities, claiming to implement the so-called "brilliant strategies to manage the current situation and govern the country."</p>
<p>Three: Mr. Chen solemnly declared in his will that he is purely Chinese, and there is a reason for this. Because Mr. Chen felt that his Mandarin was not sufficient to convey complex thoughts, he often used English. This is undeniably the greatest weakness of his life. Because of this weakness, his opponents slandered him, saying that he was of mixed blood and not purely Chinese. During the Wuhan era when he vehemently spoke on behalf of Chinese nationalism, this slander was most prevalent and often appeared in British magazines and newspapers. Even in John Gunther's "Inside Asia" a few years ago, this malicious but meaningless slander continued. Gunther may have had no other intention but was probably fooled by [William Henry] Donald. "One dog barks, and a hundred dogs follow," and human nature and reason have not yet transcended this stage, which is a pity. Mr. Chen's ancestral home is Shunde, Guangdong. His mother was registered in Panyu, Guangdong. At the age of eight, she fled overseas with her parents due to the failure of the Taiping Rebellion. She is now over ninety years old, and communication has been cut off due to the war. I hope she is still alive. Mr. Chen's father also fled overseas due to the collapse of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Therefore, in terms of bloodline, what flows in Mr. Chen's veins is not only the blood of a purely Chinese person but also the hot blood of a Chinese nationalist and revolutionary. His revolutionary character and revolutionary passion can be said to be "in his blood" and are by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Four: In the last paragraph of his will, Mr. Chen declared that he would reject and not recognize any kinship or family relationship with people of non-purely Chinese blood. This decision was well known to Mr. Chen's friends. In his replies to friends' letters, he had repeatedly stated this very clearly. Six years ago, because a related relative falsely used his name for political activities, he also reported this to the relevant military and political authorities twice, making solemn declarations. Five years ago, he also publicly published a similar statement in the Hong Kong English-language South China Morning Post for this matter. Mr. Chen's attitude towards people and things is unambiguous, and this is one example. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Today's Air Defense Day Training: Traffic and Sound Control; Strict Nighttime Light Control</h3>
<p>Today (the 9th) is the seventh Air Defense Day. The Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters has stipulated that various air defense drills will be held, and citizens must follow the regulations of the air defense authorities and implement them effectively.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Traffic and Sound Control</p>
<p>Special attention should be paid to traffic and sound control. After the first and second alerts are issued, all vehicles must park in places that do not obstruct traffic, and pedestrians should immediately wait quietly on both sides of the street in an orderly manner. Traffic can only begin five minutes after the vehicles and pedestrians are arranged. Except in unavoidable circumstances, cars and other vehicles must absolutely not honk their horns arbitrarily. At the same time, with the assistance of the military and police, the department will dispatch special enforcement teams to check the sound devices and light covers of various motor vehicles. If there are any imperfections, they will be rectified. After the third alarm is issued, in addition to implementing the same training as in the first and second alerts, light control must be strictly implemented. Citizens must absolutely pay attention to avoiding light leakage. Even when using flashlights, they must cover them with blackout cloth or paper, to thoroughly implement various traffic and light controls.</p>
<p>Each District Holds Separate Drills</p>
<p>In addition, various air defense drills will be held in various districts of the city today. The special defense groups of factories and large businesses will also separately carry out rescue, firefighting, and extinguishing exercises. In order to make all city defense personnel proficient in various city defense measures and prevent the occurrence of any emergencies. The first district's Baojia self-defense force and the general headquarters, in cooperation to complete the air defense wall of Greater Shanghai, will conduct traffic and sound control training from 10:00 AM to 10:30 AM and from 3:00 PM to 3:30 PM today. Light control will be implemented from 9:00 PM to 10:30 PM. The air defense headquarters of the First Police Bureau has ordered the self-defense forces of Nanshi and the Baojia personnel in the entire district to strictly comply with all points indicated by the Army and Navy Defense Headquarters, in order to improve the air defense measures in the district. At the same time, strict enforcement will be carried out for nighttime vehicle light control.</p>
<p>Air Defense Songs Recorded into Records</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Citizens' Air Defense Headquarters previously offered a reward in this newspaper to solicit lyrics for citizen-composed city defense songs, in order to promote the air defense will of the five million citizens of Shanghai and strengthen Shanghai's determination to defend itself. The lyrics written by Jin Yugu, the first-class winner, have been commissioned by the composer Shen Le Yin to set to music. The Asian Record Manufacturing Factory has produced a record called the Greater Shanghai Air Defense Song, with the issue number 1009, which is scheduled to be released within days. The melody reveals the heroic spirit of the German nation, which inspires people to rise up. In order to help popularize the air defense song, the China Music Industry Co., Ltd. has also commissioned its composition department to set the lyrics to a popular song and invited Ms. Li Xianglan to record it. The test record has been completed and is scheduled to be produced and sold at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The air defense song will be broadcast on the radio starting from the morning of the 9th of this month to entertain the citizens. In addition, the first episode of the air defense film being produced by the China Film Culture Production Factory will be completed in mid-month. At that time, a simultaneous screening and singing conference of the air defense film and the air defense song will be held. The Air Defense Headquarters will do its utmost to make the air defense song penetrate the people, so that the air defense will can be naturally promoted and achieve great results. It is hoped that all sectors will do their best to assist in achieving this.</p>

<h3>The Second Police Bureau Captures a Major Bandit</h3>
<p>Recently, the guerrilla bandit teams in the suburbs of the city, under the instigation of Chongqing, have been constantly stirring up trouble and plotting wrongdoing. The Director of the Second Medical Inspection Bureau of the city is paying close attention to this and has instructed Gao Zu and others stationed in the suburban areas of the city to maintain close contact and intensify prevention and control measures. On the 30th of last month, Chai Enyuan, the captain of the third brigade of the police corps stationed in Beixinjing by the bureau, received a confidential report that two companies of bandits were discovered near Yufubridge on the Lianshi Highway. He bypassed the Chengjiaqiao Seventh Bridge from the Liushi Highway to surround and search. At the Sixth Bridge, he divided into two routes to surround Yufubridge, immediately sealed off the area for inspection, and arrested Gu Runzhi, the action team leader of the Chongqing-based Zhejiang-Suzhou Provincial Third Administrative Inspector's Office Anti-Weapons Brigade, and Lieutenant Adjutant Wang Duanlin. Two Mauser pistols were found on the suspects. After the team sent them to the Second Police Bureau, the bureau chief immediately ordered the Special High Section of the bureau to conduct a thorough interrogation and try to capture the remaining members of the gang. On the 6th of this month, Yao Guomei, also known as Wang Shuying, the cousin of the suspect Gu, went to the bureau's detention center to visit him. The detention center reported this to the Special High Section, which temporarily detained her for questioning. According to Yao Guomei's confession, the murder of Supervisor Cha Zizhou of the Fourth District Office on Hongqiao Road on May 1st of this year was entirely planned by Gu Runzhi, who instigated his gang to attack A Zheng (that is, A Zheng), and committed crimes such as kidnapping and extortion. After the bureau interrogated the suspect Gu, he confessed to everything. It was also revealed that on June 15th, bandits robbed Zhou Wang's 32,520 yuan of goods and three bicycles belonging to French soldiers in Caohejing, and kidnapped Chu Gentao, a velvet merchant from Tushan, extorting 200,000 yuan. It is reported that Director Lu is currently unaware of the whereabouts of the fugitive assailant, A Zheng, and has instructed his subordinates to cooperate in the search and to continue to strengthen investigations and collect clues, so that all the fugitive bandits can be caught.</p>
<h3>Various Schools Prepare to Organize Group Rice Purchases</h3>
<p>Due to the recent surge in rice prices, especially for the general education community, which has always lived a very difficult life, it is even more difficult to support themselves under the current situation. The Municipal Education Association initiated a method for member schools to purchase rice collectively and established regulations. A meeting of affiliated schools at all levels was convened at the association's headquarters at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss specific implementation methods. More than 30 principals from schools such as Zhengfeng Middle School attended the meeting, chaired by Zhou Huarin, a standing director, who reported on the motives for the initiation. The collective rice purchase regulations were then passed on the spot as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Due to the recent surge in rice prices, the lives of teachers and staff are becoming increasingly difficult. If there are no emergency relief measures, it will inevitably interrupt the singing and have a profound impact on national education. Therefore, the Shanghai Special City Education Association Member School Collective Rice Purchase Committee is specially organized.</p>
<p>One: The committee will have 31 members, elected by the meetings of participating schools.</p>
<p>One: Committee members will be unpaid, and they will be elected every six months, with the possibility of re-election.</p>
<p>One: The committee will have a general affairs group, a purchasing group, a transportation group, a distribution group, an accounting group, and a public relations group. The staff of each group will be appointed by the members.</p>
<p>One: The rice purchased by the committee will be distributed to the schools in the nature of consumer cooperation.</p>
<p>One: For the convenience of transportation statistics, the committee will handle it in batches.</p>
<p>One: The committee will join the Education Association Welfare Section to apply to the Municipal Government and the Rice Control Committee for special purchase certificates and official transportation passports. (According to official passport regulations, the specified number is between 10 shi and 375 shi, that is, 300 bags).</p>
<p>One: The committee plans to designate Wuxi, Suzhou, Taicang, Qingpu, Wanshan, and other producing areas as the purchasing scope.</p>
<p>One: The regulations for applying to participate in the collective rice purchase are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Applications for participation are limited to teachers and staff, and the number of people is divided into four categories: A (30 or more people), B (20 to 30 people), C (10 to 20 people), and D (5 to 10 people). (B) The amount of rice to be applied for by teachers and staff is limited to 1.5 shi per person per semester. If the amount is insufficient, the distribution may be reduced. (C) The amount of rice to be purchased by the applicant schools must first pay 60% of the approximate price of the rice. (D) The insufficient amount will be borrowed from the bank by the committee, and the interest and difficult printing costs will be shared by the applicant schools. (E) The applicant schools must provide their own rice sacks, which will be returned when the rice is issued. (F) After receiving the notice of rice issuance from the committee, the applicant schools must go to the designated location to collect the rice on time. (G) If the market price fluctuates, and if the rice is not collected after the notice is given, the committee has the right to reallocate it to other schools, and any losses incurred as a result shall be borne by the original applicant school.</p>
<p>One: The committee's address is specially set at 5 Dihua Road.</p>
<p>One: The committee's regulations will be implemented after being approved by the committee meeting.</p>
<p>One: If there are any imperfections in these regulations, they must be amended with the approval of more than half of the committee members.</p>

At a time when summer health and the promotion of savings are being emphasized, it is hoped that all sectors will listen to Shanghai Xiyou at 7:45 PM tonight.</p>
<h3>City Residents' Park Lecture Meeting Held Enthusiastically Last Night; President Jiang of the Central Naval Academy Gave the Main Speech</h3>
<p>The Shanghai News Association, in order to deepen the understanding of the current war situation in the Pacific among all citizens and strengthen their belief in victory, held a city residents' park lecture meeting yesterday (August 8th) at 7:00 PM at the Harding Garden on Jing'an Temple Road. They specially invited Lieutenant General Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy, to give a difficult speech. Citizens from all walks of life in the city rushed to the medical details in large numbers, which was quite unique. There were also movie stars singing famous songs and screening movies to add to the entertainment. The situation was very enthusiastic before the start. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Occasion of the Meeting</p>
<p>The venue for the City Residents' Park Lecture Meeting was set up in the central square of Harding Garden. The First Police Bureau's band specially played music on the spot. China Film Company also sent personnel to shoot newsreels of the meeting. President Meng, along with his colleagues, arrived at the meeting on time. Also present were Captain Hirata of the Allied Forces Press Reporting Department, Trustee Lin, and prominent figures from industry and commerce, Chen Juntatsushiro, Chen Shaodi, as well as the association's executive directors Xu Liqiu, Chen Binhe, Lu Guangjie, Weng Yongqing, Lu Feng, Zhu Yongkang, Cheng Zhongquan, and Executive Secretary Ren Yunpeng, among others. No less than several thousand citizens listened to the lecture, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The meeting was opened by Xu Liqiu, the chairman of the board of directors for the month, who said: "At this crucial stage of the Greater East Asia War, the news from the front lines has been reported in various newspapers. In order to strengthen our belief in victory, we are holding this park lecture meeting today and have invited President Meng to give a speech. The President has devoted himself to cultivating Chinese naval talents over the years. Therefore, after listening to President Meng's speech today, I believe everyone's belief in the current war situation will be further strengthened, and the final victory of the Greater East Asia War is imminent." Finally, he expressed his infinite gratitude to the military authorities for assisting in maintaining order at the meeting and to the various departments that participated. Then, President Meng was invited to give a speech, first providing a detailed analysis of the current war situation in the Pacific and expressing his deep hope that the Chinese people would strengthen their belief and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, and so on. Afterwards, there were singing performances and the screening of the China Film Company's epic film "Phoenixes Singing in Harmony." The gathering ended joyfully at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Jiang's Speech</p>
<p>Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Military Academy, spoke, saying briefly: "Today, I am grateful for the invitation from the News Association to explain the current situation of the Pacific war to everyone. I cannot refuse this brotherly duty. At this critical period of the Pacific decisive battle, what kind of determination should we have? Since June 11th, in the (lonely) Pacific, we have taken the opportunity to launch an attack. After the enemy's island-hopping strategy failed, they advanced to a central assault, hoping to threaten the Allied mainland in the Pacific or seize Southeast Asia. However, with no progress in Southeast Asia, they resorted to their tricks, adopting a central breakthrough towards the Mariana Islands and the Ogasawara Islands. These methods are not worthy of being called by the brave Allied soldiers. The enemy's American tactics will definitely fail to manifest. Therefore, our judgment of the war situation should be based on the overall situation and not on small-scale speculation. The enemy's lucky dreams will inevitably lead to failure and nothing to gain. Now, our observation of the future war situation is that, during the current operational phase, there is no clear victory or defeat. Once the regular war begins, the remnants of the enemy will be defeated and scattered in chaos. Secondly, the enemy's use of a small corner to threaten Japan is practically impossible. Moreover, they are attacking Japan's inner defense line, and they feel the difficulty of a distant supply line. The future of the American enemy will be even darker. The enemy's previous island-hopping strategy in the Pacific has resulted in broken legs and arms, suffering serious injuries. Now, they have lost more than forty changes in their battle plan for Saipan Island, and their aircraft have reached six or seven hundred. Therefore, after further fierce attacks by the brave Allied soldiers, they should be completely collapsed. The enemy's own efforts are not the best. Using a small island and exhausting a large number of weapons is not something a wise person would do. The enemy's attempt this time is nothing more than to ease domestic public opinion and save people's hearts. The fighting in the Allied Japan has always followed the immortal spirit of Marshal Togo, waiting for work in leisure, and will be fully demonstrated in the upcoming regular war. It is clear that the enemy still does not realize its mistake, but its morale is declining. At the same time, the enemy's American's inner anxiety is due to the fact that the climate in the Pacific after July and August will change drastically. At that time, hurricanes will erupt, and the pitifully educated enemy's navy will hardly be able to endure the hardships of the wind and waves. Only the Allied soldiers are well-trained and able to cope with the financial situation. Therefore, geographically, it is another example of the enemy's failure. Therefore, we must not stand by and watch during the current stage of fierce fighting. It is unacceptable to stand idly by during the process of participation in the war. When the last World War ended, why did our country not gain benefits despite declaring victory? Therefore, we must make redoubled efforts this time and reflect on past mistakes. The military should deeply understand that the Greater East Asia War is a shared hardship for the people of East Asia and cannot be shirked. Therefore, the government's participation in the war has far-reaching implications. In the past, there were disputes between China and Japan, which were tragically separated by foreigners. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, under the determination of one nation, we have jointly resisted foreign aggression. Therefore, we should endure hardship and work hard, cooperate with each other for the future of China and Japan, and drive out the aggressive forces of Europe and the United States."</p>
<h3>Uniform Implementation of Buying Rice for Five Dou; The Emblem Lecture Issuance Office Received Orders to Start Yesterday</h3>
<p>The temporary permit issuing offices of the Rice and Grain Control Committee received a letter from the Inspection Office of the committee on July 6th, 33rd year of the Republic stating, "According to the Secretary-General's instructions, all temporary permit issuing offices must also requisition those applying for temporary certificates for five dou or more, and so on. Therefore, this is hereby notified." After receiving the order, the temporary permit issuing offices, in addition to posting notices for public knowledge, began to implement the uniform requisitioning starting on July 7th.</p>
<p>Brief Commentary</p>
<h3>Can We Still Ignore and Disregard It?</h3>
<p>The Rice Control Committee has been implementing the requisitioning of rice and grain for households with five dou or more since July 1st, and since the 7th, those with five dou have also been uniformly requisitioned. We have already spoken about the shortcomings of the requisitioning method in the editorial of the 7th based on statistics. The public opinion of various newspapers in Tai City has also unanimously suggested solutions to the rice and grain problem, but the speakers are earnest, and the listeners are indifferent. The Rice Control Committee authorities have failed to pay attention to public sentiment and public opinion, insisting on their own way, making the food problem increasingly serious, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>The matter of concealment can be seen from the poor results, and it is clear that problems are arising. In fact, the situation is restrictive, but they insist on adhering to their own views, putting people's livelihood at risk. How can they explain themselves? We believe that the soaring price of grain and the heavy suffering of the people's livelihood are the absolute responsibility of the Rice Control Committee. Since the Commercial Control Committee has been adjusted to be the supervisory and guiding organ of the Rice Control Committee, the Commercial Control Committee has the responsibility to correct the unreasonable measures of the Rice Control Committee and cannot shirk its responsibility. The Shanghai Municipal Government authorities are the parents of all the citizens, and the municipal government also has the responsibility to correct the serious suffering of the people's livelihood due to unreasonable rice and grain measures and should not allow them to act arbitrarily. At the same time, the Allied authorities have been concerned about the people's livelihood in China, and the current food problem in Shanghai has reached a serious life-and-death issue. It is expected that the Allied authorities will not sit idly by.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to ask, to which organization does the Rice Control Committee belong? Should the superior organization exercise its supervisory and corrective functions? Now, whether it is any individual, any family, any public or private institution or organization, who is not anxious and uneasy about the issue of rice? Since the Rice Control Committee can insist on its own views, disregard the people's livelihood, and disregard public sentiment. However, the severity of the people's food has reached such a point, can the Commercial Control Committee and the Municipal Government district bureaus also disregard and not address the increasing suffering of the people's livelihood?</p>
<h3>Anti-British Photo Exhibition in India Opens Today</h3>
<p>The "Anti-British Resistance History Photo Exhibition in India," jointly organized by the Shanghai Propaganda Office and the East Asia League Shanghai Branch, will open to the public today (the 9th) at the China Real Estate Garden at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road.

<h3>Insights on Air Defense</h3>
<p>— Aichiro Fujiyama</p>
<p>The European landing invasion war has finally begun. The Allied German forces are very welcoming of the Anglo-American landing operation, and the whole country is sharpening its swords and entering the decisive battle stage. We are also looking forward to the American Pacific invasion operation, hoping to have the opportunity to give them a head-on blow. Since last year, the increase in aircraft and ships required by the whole country has been my personal preparation. Now, all levels of society, regardless of old or young, male or female, should devote all their efforts to the production increase movement within their respective areas of responsibility. This is the only element of victory for us in dealing with the materially abundant United States. The decisive battle stage is approaching day by day, and enemy aircraft raids will surely materialize. We should be fully prepared for the sake of perfection. The large-scale air raids on Hamburg and Berlin since last winter have given us very good lessons.</p>
<p>The purpose of air warfare is to disrupt people's minds by using urban air raids, and at the same time, to destroy production facilities, thereby reducing the enemy's combat power.</p>
<p>If port facilities and bridges are destroyed, transportation capacity will inevitably be reduced, which will inevitably affect production. At the same time, if factory towers are destroyed, it will directly affect the country's fertility. This is what the enemy hopes for.</p>
<p>In the past, the people responded calmly and overcame various difficulties. Under the bombing of groups of five hundred or one thousand enemy aircraft, the German people were able to responsibly defend their country and prevent the erosion of productive forces. Not only did they prevent the decline of productive forces, but they also continued to work hard to increase production under fierce air strikes. Therefore, Germany still has the surplus to fight against the Anglo-American landing forces.</p>
<p>In Japan, we also anticipate the arrival of air raids, so we are either working on evacuation or air defense training. No matter when the enemy aircraft come, we are preparing at all times. The government's enthusiastic guidance and the tense awareness of the nationals themselves have made every national deeply feel the importance of air defense. Therefore, the evacuation work is progressing very smoothly, and training is uninterrupted. The work of defending the soil is becoming stronger day by day, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>However, this cannot make us fully satisfied. The current air defense system cannot make us absolutely at ease.</p>
<p>In the past, our country's air defense strategy focused on controlling lights or other disguises to avoid enemy aircraft bombing as much as possible, minimizing casualties, and at the same time, using fire training to prevent the expansion of the damaged area. In the past, the training of the people has achieved considerable results in the above points.</p>
<p>However, does this kind of air defense strategy fundamentally ignore the most important work in air defense?</p>
<p>Judging from the current war situation, the most important work is how to quickly restore the destroyed productive forces so that productive forces do not decline due to air raids; at the same time, how to restore the destroyed transportation capacity so that it can still transport production materials and maintain the people's food supply in an instant. As for communication equipment, it must also be restored immediately so that production work is not affected in the slightest.</p>
<p>In Germany, the people's production activities were completely restored within a few days after the air raid. However, although the German production sector has been subjected to such large-scale air raids, it is still prepared to recover quickly, preventing the decline of productive forces to a minimum.</p>
<p>Under today's circumstances, officials and civilians should work together to seriously study how to restore and quickly rebuild the damaged areas, so that all preparations can be perfect. Therefore, training and exercises are very necessary.</p>
<p>To rebuild a destroyed factory, how to mobilize the necessary workers, how to concentrate a large number of materials? At the same time, if the damaged factory is moved to another location, how should it be handled to increase productivity? If these many questions are not fully prepared now, it will inevitably lead to panic and helplessness in the future.</p>
<p>In order to quickly restore damaged factories, it may be necessary to remove part of the walls of neighboring production companies. Therefore, various laws and regulations must also be appropriately prepared. As for the movement or concentration of workers, if it is still based on the old concepts, good results cannot be obtained.</p>
<p>The sections related to production problems are extremely broad, not just material and labor issues, but even transportation, food, and finance must echo each other and establish a detailed plan. If the communication and communication links under the air raid lose their function, the transmission of various management policies cannot proceed smoothly, and it will only lead to a state of confusion. At the same time, it will affect the unrest and shaking of the entire economic world. If people's hearts are unstable, the decline in production efficiency will be unspeakable.</p>
<p>The establishment of a plan is indeed difficult, but the more difficult it is, the more we should have the courage to deal with everything. In the call to increase aircraft and ships, this kind of countermeasure must be fully prepared. When the government is examining major issues, it must start from now to make full preparations; at the same time, in the private sector, the Tongzhi Council should be used as the center to fully develop appropriate solutions to various problems. Especially for production problems, if they are divorced from reality, various laws and orders are just empty words.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the private sector must also consider countermeasures at the same time. If the opinions of various industries do not sweep away past prejudices, the important responsibility of restarting production will not be able to be promoted.</p>
<p>This is the most important air defense countermeasure, the most important countermeasure against air raids to carry out the war.</p>
<p>The two major elements of air defense are: maintaining the damage to a minimum, and having various preparations so that damaged factories can be quickly restored. If these two points can be completed, the purpose of air defense countermeasures can be said to have been achieved. (Translated from the June 11th Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun)</p>

<h3>Who is Misleading the Nation? - Information Department Chief of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Tadahisa Matsudaira</p>
<p>Seven years have passed since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and two and a half years have passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Now, the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia are facing a stage that will determine their destiny.</p>
<p>I have no intention of arguing about who is responsible for this war, but calmly observing the relationship between China and Japan over the past ten years or so, which has led the destinies of the two countries to misfortune, there are indeed reasons for this. Moreover, it is possible to reverse the fact that a portion of future world wars – the Anglo-Japanese War and the Japanese-American War – will rage even more fiercely on Chinese territory, and there are also reasons for the increasing difficulties of the Republic of China. Now, I will elaborate on my humble opinion based on past fair history (part of which is not yet public).</p>
<p>Who made Britain and the United States join the disputes in East Asia?</p>
<p>The historical turning point in East Asia began with the Incident, but Japan advocated: 1) a policy of non-expansion; 2) direct negotiations. At that time, the Chinese National Government initially expressed agreement with Japan's proposal. Ambassador Ariyoshi began consultations with T.V. Soong, but on the third day, T.V. Soong suddenly changed his mind and informed Japan that China would bring the Manchurian Incident to the League of Nations. In the spring of that year, Wang Jingwei, Sun Fo, Gu Yingfen, Tang Shaoyi, Chen Youren, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Chen Jitang, Tang Shengzhi, and others gathered in Guangzhou to convene an extraordinary meeting and establish a National Government opposed to Chiang Kai-shek. The Guangzhou National Government advocated direct negotiations. When Chen Youren and Sun Fo proposed preparing various basic conditions for formal direct negotiations with Japan, I was present and clearly felt the expressions of Sun Fo and the complexion of Chen Youren. However, Japan had recognized the Nanjing National Government but not the Guangzhou government, so it proceeded according to the opinions of T.V. Soong and others. Representatives of the Chinese and Japanese, yellow races, stood before the white races in the League of Nations and were questioned. The intervention of Britain and the United States in East Asian affairs became more and more assertive.</p>
<p>Exposing the Conspiracy of the People's Front Faction</p>
<p>Before the Xi'an Incident occurred, Yang Yongtai, Chairman of Hubei Province, was suddenly assassinated. At that time, I was working in Hankou and had the last meeting with this senior member of the Political Science faction before his death. When Mr. Yang was carried to Tongren Hospital, I immediately went to comfort him. At that time, He Chengjun was already there, earnestly comforting Mrs. Yang, who was crying in pain. Yang Yongtai was attacked by the People's Front faction on his way home after attending a luncheon with the American Consul General. Before this incident, many ominous events occurred between China and Japan, such as the Chengdu Incident, the murder of Mr. Nakano, a Japanese resident in Beihai, and the assassination of patrolman Kichi in Hankou, all of the same nature, which were only discovered later. Subsequently, the murderer who assassinated Yang Yongtai was arrested. After further investigation of the party, it was learned that all the ominous events directed at the Japanese were the work of the Communist Party, which claimed to be the People's Front faction. Their conspiracy attempted to provoke disputes between China and Japan, assassinate anti-communist elements, and even target Chiang Kai-shek himself. According to He Chengjun, the Communist Party had a plan to send special personnel to infiltrate the sedan bearers used when Chiang climbed Lushan, attempting to poison him in the valley while Chiang Kai-shek was climbing Lushan. It was also learned that Zhang Xueliang and the Seven Gentlemen of Shanghai were in contact with each other, and many of his subordinates were communist elements. After Chiang Kai-shek spent his fiftieth birthday in Luoyang, he intended to inspect Zhang Xueliang's communist suppression troops, but Chen Cheng went to Luoyang in advance to report the Communist Party's conspiracy and tried his best to lure Chiang to Xi'an. However, Chiang did not care and was detained in Xi'an, which made a 180-degree turn in Chinese history.</p>
<p>The Mystery of the End of the Xi'an Incident</p>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident occurred, He Yingqin and others in Nanjing advocated attacking Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng, even if the attack would endanger Chiang Kai-shek's life. Most people thought that there was little hope that Chiang Kai-shek would return to Nanjing safely. However, at that time, I indirectly received surprising information from a Communist Party member, saying that Chiang Kai-shek could return to Nanjing within two weeks, or that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could reach a compromise and that the policies of the National Government would undergo major changes. At that time, I thought that there was such a fact, and only laughed it off. However, not long after, Soong Mei-ling and T.V. Soong took the opportunity to go to Xi'an, and the war faction led by He Yingqin and others disappeared invisibly. Chiang Kai-shek also survived, and Zhang Xueliang and others followed and were instead placed under arrest. This kind of fact can be said to be extremely ridiculous. Chiang and Soong's "Xi'an Diary" does not mention a single word about the Communist Party's negotiations. How exactly did they get Chiang Kai-shek to survive with just one sentence is still a mystery. However, the subsequent changes in the situation were roughly the same as what the Communist Party member had said before.</p>
<p>Regarding the Restoration of Peace between China and Japan</p>
<p>Why was Chiang swayed by the opinions of other countries? After the Incident, Germany acted as an intermediary to start peace negotiations between China and Japan, which took place from the 27th to the beginning of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1938-1939). This is a well-known fact. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's attitude, including his opinions on the peace conditions, was described in detail in Chairman Wang's "Give an Example" paper. The opinions of Bai Chongxi, Xu Yongchang, Tang Shengzhi, and others present were also described in detail in this paper.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek said: "If there is no such clause, then this condition is not a condition for national subjugation, so even if we talk about peace, it doesn't matter." Bai, Xu, Tang, and others also expressed their agreement. However, Chiang later informed a certain country of the peace conditions, and Chiang listened to the opinions of that country and took action.</p>
<p>Why Chiang Kai-shek did this, whether he was encouraged by T.V. Soong and Soong Mei-ling, is also unknown. But in short, this is the same as the method of introducing the League of Nations in the Manchurian Incident, which only increases the voice of foreign countries in East Asia. This is definitely not an attitude that a government that flaunts independence and autonomy should take. Moreover, by allowing other countries to interfere in diplomacy, they are always in a subordinate position, and they have to follow the whims of other countries. Their national policies are swayed by other countries. Although they verbally claim to hope that the people will rise up, the result is to put them in the unfortunate situation of colonial people.</p>
<p>Why did Chongqing Declare War on Japan?</p>
<p>The China Incident can also be called a civil strife in the Greater East Asia War, and it is not the same as the war against Britain and the United States. Japan had not declared war on Chongqing, and even when Japan declared war on Britain and the United States, it still had not declared war on Chongqing, because the relationship between China and Japan was not like a quarrel between partners, but a dispute between brothers within the walls.</p>
<p>However, Chongqing immediately declared war on Japan after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. It had not declared war for more than four years in the past, and after four and a half years, it declared war again. What is the reason for this? I think it is only due to the pressure from Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>What will happen if Chongqing declares war on Japan? This means that a world war can be conducted on the Chinese mainland. In other words, Britain and the United States do not have to notify Chongqing and can freely use Chongqing's territory as a base of operations. Chongqing cannot refuse Chongqing's territory to become a battlefield for Japan's war against Britain and the United States. As a result, the Chinese people will suffer heavy losses. The mainland operations currently underway are, from Japan's perspective, unavoidable measures for self-defense, but for the Chinese people, it is truly regrettable. This kind of result has to be attributed to the Chongqing side's diplomatic policy mistakes, and most of the responsibility should be borne by them.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Who does not maintain the face of East Asians? Last year, someone came from Chongqing, and I asked him: "When you learned that the Japanese army destroyed the American navy in Pearl Harbor and sank two British warships in the Malay Sea, what were your feelings?" He replied: "Most people in Chongqing felt happy, thinking that there was not a great difference between Britain and the United States and us." We also have the same feelings as the people in Chongqing, thinking that "blood is thicker than water" after all. Looking at the recent situation, there are many things that Chongqing has changed its policies under the pressure of Britain and the United States. To give one example, Britain and the United States said that the book "The Destiny of China" has totalitarian and xenophobic content, so it must be revised, or that the draft of the May Fifth Constitution does not conform to British and American democracy and must be revised and implemented as soon as possible, and even that Chongqing should listen to the claims of the Communist Party and show concessions. And the so-called "pro-American faction" such as T.V. Soong would rather sacrifice the people and follow Britain and the United States. I really don't know what their intentions are. When we look at the results of the Cairo Conference, Britain and the United States even raised the issue of Korea and Taiwan. At that time, an agreement was discussed that if this issue was not resolved, the war would continue forever. This was a malicious conspiracy to obstruct the progress of peace between China and Japan and to make China and Japan eternal enemies. However, Chongqing was extremely excited about the results of this meeting, unaware that they had been used by Britain and the United States. These people have lost their original East Asian face, and their nature has become slaves to Britain and the United States. Who is misleading the nation? Future generations of the Chinese nation will judge this, and history will prove it.</p>

<h3>Blue Swastika Society Establishes a Plague Hospital in Tushanwan</h3>
<p>The residents in the Xujiahui area of ​​western Shanghai mostly make a living by peddling, and they have never paid attention to hygiene. Therefore, every summer, plagues are prevalent, far more so than in other places. In the past, local gentry managed Chinese medicine clinics to provide diagnosis and medicine, which was convenient for the poor and sick. However, when encountering acute illnesses such as infectious diseases, they had to be sent to other places for treatment, which was quite difficult. Now, the Blue Swastika Society has agreed to establish a plague hospital, borrowing Chen's residence in Tushanwan Huinan Elementary School as a temporary hospital site, and appointing Dr. Zhang Xuecheng, the director of Xuhui Hospital, to preside over the hospital affairs. It will start accepting patients from today. The hospital will temporarily set up 40 beds, specializing in the treatment of cholera, vomiting, diarrhea, acute gastroenteritis, dysentery, etc., and also treating ordinary internal and surgical diseases. Whether it is outpatient or inpatient, it is completely free, and emergency treatment is available all night. However, due to the huge expenses and the urgent need for medical supplies, we urgently hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate, so that not only the remote residents of Xuhui will benefit greatly, but also the farmers in the nearby suburbs will receive endless benefits. If you would like to donate medicines (cash donations are declined), please call 75465 at Xuhui Hospital for contact, or send them directly to Huinan Elementary School, Chen's Residence.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Written by Toyoo Iwata, Translated into Western Language</p>
<p>Cherry Blossoms and Anchors (5)</p>
<p>(This must be what the teacher made it.)</p>
<p>Longfu suddenly thought of this, and felt very ashamed, so he wanted to immediately run to Mr. Ichiki's house to apologize.</p>
<p>He quickly put on his clothes and went to wash his feet. In fact, it was as he had speculated.</p>
<p>"No, I originally wanted to send that painting to the Art Exhibition. But after careful consideration, a warship painting is slightly unsuitable for the Art Exhibition, and I am an examiner, so it is actually unfavorable to you."</p>
<p>The painter Ichiki seemed not to notice Longfu's indifference to the painting and his rudeness to his elders, and he did not boast about his deliberate order to 童隆夫 to send the painting for exhibition.</p>
<p>"Because you haven't come lately, I gave it to the exhibition without seeking your consent. Although it is not a famous exhibition, it is somewhat gratifying to have the award from the Minister of the Navy. It would be better to have a gold star award."</p>
<p>Longfu felt very 羞 when he heard such understated words. So he deeply appreciated the teacher's kindness.</p>
<p>"Why don't you take this opportunity to go back to your hometown? You can say that you are returning home in glory. Perhaps in Kagoshima Prefecture, you are the only one who has received a special selection from the Art Exhibition with the award from the Minister of the Navy. This will allow your father to no longer worry about you."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Longfu was very happy and accepted the advice.</p>
<p>After eating dinner at the painter's house that day, he happily returned to Koenji.</p>
<p>When he looked at the newspaper the next morning, his name was published in the corner of the social column as the winner of the Sea Country Exhibition. Even if many readers would gloss over this news, it appeared in Longfu's eyes like a monument.</p>
<p>(For the first time in my life, the world knows about me.)</p>
<p>Hot tears streamed from his eyes, and he wiped them away with his fingernails.</p>
<p>He didn't even eat breakfast and ran to the hall of the Nihonbashi Department Store. There were only two or three people. He ran to his painting and stood in front of it like a statue. His face was a little red, his feet were jumping, and he didn't feel like he was looking at the painting. After a while, he calmed down and the words "Minister's Award" came into view. He saw many shortcomings himself, and he should have painted it better. He didn't know that this was proof, that he had improved since he painted it half a year ago.</p>
<p>(If it were now, I wouldn't paint it like this.)</p>
<p>He expressed a sigh of loss, but when he discovered that the frame was the painter Ichiki's favorite, his heart was filled with gratitude. (114)</p>
