<h3 id="c1">向社會富有人士進一言 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>昨論「贊助警察消費合作社」，列舉警察擔負的責任，非常重大，而目前所受的待遇，却非當菲薄，兩相比衡，極不相稱，極不合理。所以，一方面要求警察盡其責任，另一方面必須顧到調整警察待遇，改善警察生活。惟有生活得到最低限度的安定以後，才能課以應盡的重責，這在實際上理論上都應顧道的事。老實說，如果只談責任問題，而不顧到實際生活，結果警察的責任未必能盡，而警察對於本身的生活，却也未必能束手待斃。在這種情况之下，警察莫不以解決本身生活間題為第一，為首要；而以盡共責任問題為第二，為次要。我們如果平心靜氣地默察現狀，很可能演變到此種地步，這是全市民衆，尤其是社會各界領袖應該共同認</p>
<p>在此大東亞戰爭決戰階段，本市居於後方重要基地的地位，發揮一切力量，貢獻於戰爭，巳為無可諉卸的責任。然而發揮一切力量，並不是簡單的事，必須有計劃，有組織，有步驟，上下一致，相互配合，循序以進。而最主要的先決條件，一切內在的努力，必須得到外圍的保障，那末，這種努力，才不致落空，才能得到應有的成效。所謂「外圍的保障」，就是確保治安，維護治安。所以，維護洽安，是確保一切參戰力量的先決條件。這是尤應共同認淸的一點。</p>
<p>况且，前方愈是接近決戰的嚴重階段，後方愈會發現敵人的蓄意破壞。因此，維護治安，保衛地方，警奸察宄，確保戰力，更見重要。這究是誰的責任呢？當然，地方警察的責任最為艱鉅。我們可以說，維護治安，是地方警察的責任，而改善警察生活，使能安文心服務則是政府當局與全市人民共同的責任。</p>
<p>現在第一警察局陳兼局長暨渡蘇兩副局長已經發起組織警察消費合作社，以期逐漸改善警察生活。合作社正在積極籌備，先向各界有力人士請求墊借資金四千萬元，辦法已見昨日各報。我們願以至誠謹向本市工商界領袖，富有資力人士進言，盼望重視警察責任與改善生活的重要性，以及維護治安與上海安詣的關聯性，公共協助警察消費合作社，慷慨墊惜資金，俾及早成立。况且，合作社雖非商業營利，而常有存貨，即爲資金借款的擔保，更規定利息，分期拔還，決非捐款可比。該社限期本月底集資足額，更盼</p>
<p>最後，値得提出的，聞本市銀錢業公會方面，葉扶宵，林康侯諸先生，市商會袁履登諸先生，市民福利協會聞蘭亭趙晋鄉諸先生，對於該社組織，熱烈襄贊。尤可欽佩者，如中儲行當局墊借二百萬元，中亞銀行盛幼會董事長墊借一百萬元，率先倡導，他如烟葉，新藥，火柴及化學工業原料等同業公會亦尤墊借巨款。新聞報及本報亦各墊十萬元，以示響應。諒社會各界領袖，平昔對於公益，熱心不遺餘力，定必聞風繼起，羣力促成，則不但警察生活之幸，抑亦上海治安前途之幸。</p>

<p>布達佩期二十三日中央社電據洪牙利通信社昨午後發表政府公報稱：根據德·洪兩國相互了解，德軍業已開抵洪牙利境。此項措施，基於三國公約國家聯合作戰，以助該國抵抗共同之敵人，尤為動員所有兵力，以增强自衛，而對抗布爾雪維克主義。兩同盟國政府决定繼續兩國間友誼，與共同作戰之精神，為德，洪兩國人民爭取最後之勝利。至於洪牙利內閣辭職後，攝政霍爾第海軍上將，已令前駐德大使史托傑（Doeme　Szeojay）組織新閣，其名單如次：</p>

<p>柏林二十三日中央社電新任洪牙利首揆兼外長史托傑元帥，一八八〇年一月五日生於布達佩斯，在第一次大戰中，曾任事於參謀總部，一九三二年被任駐柏林軍事參贊，一九三五年十二月被任洪牙利駐德大使，致力於德·洪兩國間之友誼。史托傑元帥係洪國軍人之代表·證明係與德軍於世界大戰之戰場巾繼續合力作戰者。</p>
<p>柏林三日中央社電昨日公吿，德元首經外部長里賓特洛甫之推薦，任命佛森曼卜博士為德駐匈牙利大使並全權代表，原任駐法大使亞哥已調回外部供職。</p>
<h3 id="c4">洪下令解散社會民主黨 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>布達佩斯二十三日中央社電　德軍根據德·洪間之協議，十九日拂曉由西方及南方開入洪牙利領土後，順利配備於鐵路沿綫及洪京附近地區基地，與洪國警察協力警備，洪政府已卞令解散社會民主黨，左翼納普薩瓦報亦奉命停刋，國內秩序頗為整然。人心亦極平靜。開入洪京之德軍為數頗少，市內狀况殆無變化，但禁止集會，向來洪國國內之戰時體制，較保·羅兩國略欠緊張，然在德軍開人之日起，廣播電台即停止廣播，顯示更始一新之意氣。洪新內閣今後將竭力强化與軸心之合作·並整備戰時體制，推就德軍而言，勒姆堡·奧迪臨鐵路縱彼切斷，但實有以布達佩斯（洪京）·布加勒斯特（羅京）鐵幹綫阻止蘇軍進攻之必要，在政治上强化洪國國內防備，鞏固洪·羅兩國背後防備，進而使各盟國戰爭均强化起見，德國乃與洪政府協議後，採取此次保證安全之方策。</p>
<p>柏林二十三日中央社電　海通社訊：此間政界方面對洪牙利新政府之成立與德·洪聯合防務協定，表示熟烈之歡迎，政界觀察者評論布達佩斯昨晚之官方公報稱：洪牙利現巳明白該國對歐洲之義務與責任。措施以抗共產主義，並將實施步驟，以除國內之敗戰份子，因洪牙利軍隊之實力不足以單獨防守邊界，故德軍抵達洪牙利以助洪軍。</p>
<h3 id="c5">第二戰綫開闢前　歐洲空戰的激化 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>在展開第二戰綫之前，英美及德國果然開姑了前哨戰，互相轟炸。兩方面的戰爭勢力，現正集中於轟炸對方的都市·在目前戰局中，轟炸都市的意義，在這裘帶着極重要的性質。茲試以里斯本所能獲得的材料為基礎，報吿英美對德國轟炸戰之情形及其不同之點：</p>
<p>英</p>
<p>英國對德國轟炸都市的不入　，早已有人加以非難。蒲斯氏在上院稱之爲盲目轟炸而反對，但政府則淡然答謂此係有計劃的行動。英國以此都市轟炸的本質稱之為戰略轟炸，而其他轟炸稱之為地域的轟炸，將整個都市破壞燒燬盡凈。</p>
<p>一九四一年德國的轟炸倫敦及其他各地，不以其戰鬥機使用於別處，而祇破壞英國的軍事及生產設施，美國的轟炸亦同樣以軍事轟炸為目的而設計者，但英國則以都市轟炸為目的而製造轟炸機，都市的轟炸成為轟炸的主要目的。此在去年起見之事實。在此以前，英國的轟炸機隊，百分之七十為航續力及炸彈搭截量不大的雙引擎中型聶炸機，規在大部份爲四引擊的大型機，如蘭開斯脫，哈里法克斯，希林格斯等。所以轟炸方法亦與德國及美國不同，另有特色。</p>
<p>英國入型轟炸機的設計，寗可犧牲裝甲及戰鬥力而盡量多載炸彈及燒夷彈，以混擲炸彈及燒夷彈為原則。炸彈爲大型，平均美機裝載三噸半，所以有一千架飛機聶炸的時候，達三千五百噸。都巿轟炸以毀滅整個都市為目的，成其重心在於燒夷彈，炸彈則使用於破壞交通，水道及其他消防設備，高射砲及其他地上肪空設備，引起人工的風以擴大火災。所以燒夷彈尃落於引起火災的　方，其成績不表現在破壞特定的目標，而祇要在一定的面積，一定的時間內擲落若干噸炸彈，燒夷彈就算了。</p>
<p>一月十四日的轟炸布倫斯維克中，一分鐘內落下了九十噸炸彈。燒荑彈。最高的記錄也有一分鐘內達一百五千噸者。不間是學校也好，醫院也好·凡在一定地域內的東西，完全毀滅。這方法亦稱絨毬轟炸。因此不能不使用大量的轟炸機。其準備亦需要悠久的時日與大量的物資。都市轟炸的技術，英國進步最速。</p>
<p>先說目的地的選定，由情報局及其他機關愼重决定，「美方亦參加意見」。以政治及軍需生產的中心地爲第一目標，關於後者，以前最注意潛水艦製造工廠所在地，現在為飛機工廠。攻擊法係用重轟炸機編成大隊，最近則附以長距離轟炸機。時期在晚間，以前袛限于能辨明目標的月夜，近則專擇靈厚的黑夜，以避犧牲。此由於航空法之拔術的進步而始可能。第一·先須氣象學進步，藉震層掩蔽而聶炸，目能够决定歸還基地的時期，不致受突然變劣的天氣的妨礙。從英國突襲柏林及其他地方。須費相當時白，故預知氣象是非常必要的。</p>
<p>其次，用電波採知器以探知方面，亦頗發達，而黑夜飛行不以為苦。第三是嚮導機的進步，這是用特別奘　的蚊子機，蘭開斯脫，哈里法克斯，由特別訓練的人員　坐，在本隊前面出發，用特別的照準裝置，探尋目標，計劃在何時轟炸何處，投下種種顏色的照明彈。木隊看見這照明彈，即使在黑夜，也能在一定時間，一定塲所，集中轟炸。漢堡·柏林的轟炸，就是用這方法。</p>
<p>這種攻擊法使德國的防禦方法亦為之變更。用高射砲及探　燈從地上防禦，在這集中轟炸中元全無用，乃變為用大而有力的夜問戰鬥機射落轟炸機的方法。因此，戰鬥力弱的英國重轟炸隊之損失遂增加起來，敵人選擇雲層的黑夜，九爲了要妨害夜問戰鬥機的活動。（未完）（翔譯自三月四日西部每日新聞）</p>

<p>東京二十三日中央社電　據缅甸日軍某基地二十三日電，江特拉鮑斯統帥，曾於二十一日下午發表印度國民軍突破國境之聲明，　會見日緬記者團，答記者之質問，茲錄該問答如次：</p>
<p>問，國民車突破國境後閣下有何感想？</p>
<p>答，我國民軍踏入祖國國土，吾人自相當滿足，同時愈感擊減英·美責任之重大·此次奪回之地域雖小，然自一八五七年以來，能以本國軍隊聯逐敵軍尙爲創舉，實令人感慨無量。</p>
<p>間·國民軍突破國地之意義義爲何</p>
<p>答，英國於世界各戰綫連戰連敗，而於印度國內猶自負絕對不敗，今則已為吾人擊潰，此足表示英國漸已喪失防衛印度之力量。</p>
<p>問，此次國民軍突破國境，對英印軍中之印度兵及印民衆之影響如何？</p>
<p>答，此次突破國境之影響，當於數日後即可判明，過去印人未能認識吾人之行動，因此次國民軍突破國境，決可促彼等醒悟·又印度兵亦將隨時日之淮展，前來參加我陣營，更可使印人自信，以印　自身之力量，決可擊潰英國，而確認英國必至敗退。本人决不作誇大宣傳，僅願以將來逐次實現之事實，粉碎英國之企圖。</p>
<p>問，國民軍突破國境後，獨立運動之推進方式爲何？</p>
<p>答，今後吾人有兩大義務，一為使作戰有利展開，一為復興被解放之印一度地械，由臨時政府推幷理想之行政，此對尙未解放之其他地域影響甚大。</p>
<p>問，今後英國之對印態度如何？</p>
<p>答，英國對吾等已等還之地域，必將增强兵力，企圖奪回，對日本則加强惡宣傳，更對印人加以强壓</p>
<p>問·對重慶政權之影響如何？</p>
<p>答，本人前出席大東亞會議及吾於中國對重慶廣播時，曾對渝方呼答籲，祈其　認淸現實　與日本合作，切勿再作同一人種間之戰爭，當時適値渝方參加開羅會談，英·美極力諂媚渝方，故淪方對余之忠吿或置若罔聞，然英·美不僅不能援渝，且已陷於必須放棄反攻細甸野心之窘境，故渝方受受影畫甚大。此次作戰若再繼續進展，則渝方陣營內之反軸心要人亦必逐漸反省。</p>

<p>聯結新愛爾蘭，新不列顚·新幾尼亞的逼一條綫，在日本是防衛本土的外圍綫，是南太平洋作戰的重要基綫。因此，敵恃其物與還的衆多，欲突破此綫，而前來作消耗戰。在補給綫延長的困難的島嶼作戰中，以敵人與自然為對手而死戰的將士，困苦萬狀。陸軍部隊的準藥，糧秣，因島嶼，塲所的關係，不能不靠海軍部隊的協力輸送。又在敵人的制空圈內，團轟炸的危險，煞費苦心到達目的地的運輸船，其卸載工作如略遲一刻，就受到空襲而沈於海底，此種例十也很多。這是在最前綫死戰的將士們所不知道的，然而拼死的卸　工作，正是在此種悄形下進行的。</p>
<h3 id="c39">協力登陸工作 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>在波根維爾島，陸海軍早巳協刀從事登陸工作，實表示了可貴的同心協力。先前在新佐治亞島，海軍的前任將校担任陸海軍的指揮，迨陸軍的部隊長到任後，就代前任將校担任陸海軍的指揮。這種例子不僅在新佐治亞，即在新幾尼亞亦可見。相互間的關係，與其說是一密切」，不如說自始就成為一個部隊更為適當。去年〇月〇日，擊潰登陸倫特巴島敵人的精銳陸軍機，踴躍出擊〇〇基地。不期生還的陸軍機把針路指向倫特巴島·正在波根維爾島上空巡弋時，突然發見數十架戰鬥機。初猶以為是敵機，仔緬看時，那正是海軍機·協力前來參加攻擊倫特巴島。陸軍機猶如得到了百萬援兵，勇氣百借，冒着熾烈的防空砲火，向敵方軍事設備轟炸。迨確認獲得了戰果而就歸途時，敵的的空砲火，極為熾烈，大部份友機的被彈。如安田中尉的乘機，終究不能到達基地，而被迫準備自炸，或隨時降洛。而機上的射手，雖被敵彈洞穿大腿部，仍若無其事，口中啣養酸素管，繼續射擊終於浴血而倒。</p>
<p>安田中尉仍繼續操縱受傷的乘械，設法返歸友軍基地。再有二十分鐘可以返歸波根維爾島，高度幸而保持着〇〇米，然而車輸已經被彈破壞，平安登陸是絕望的了。這時不客有片刻的　躍，中尉雖知靈液根灘爾島巳在目前，但决意在眼下孤島的大沙灘上降陸。一　問，機身向左旋回，突向堤岸此時早已開了天蓋飛出·幸而飛機沒有着火。有輛汽車如疾風般駛近前來·是海軍警備隊員。雙備隊員日到平安牛還，喜極洗淚，立即將安田中尉及別的乘員乘汽車駛抵營幕，療治創傷並出酒勸飲，即使自己同隊中的人，也沒有這樣親切。大家不知通用什麽言語來表示感謝，這是右摩軍曹回想當時情形而向記者說的話：</p>
<h3 id="c40">建設的協力 <a href="#c40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>前綫陸海軍的密切協力，不僅在作戰行動上，即在建設方衛亦隨地可見。遍地瘴癘的南太平洋孤島，一切東西當然都不能就地置辦。自營幕以至於道路，都由兵十們自己製造。且戰事如愈激烈，運輸應愈困難，為準備萬以起見，不能不硏究食糧當地自給的方法，故其勞苦小是言語所能形容的。且陸軍部隊與海軍不同，沒有活動的廚房，如其占食了原居民的收獲物，原居民就要陷於飢餓，所以兵士們在激戰的空閑時間，還要據錫耕種，作為作戰任務之一。現在已經耕成了各極作物圍地很多，完成了在最小限度上就地自給的態勢，這是今後作戰上最有力的一點。且海軍方面也有着很多的農地，打開就地輸給的道路，陸海軍在作戰上，建設上，燃手向擊減美英邁進，日夜奮戰。敵人無論怎樣反攻，大問安如製石。是以雖在後方，在此轄國家典廢的一戰中，亦不能不層然厥起，前綫後方打成一片，擊滅敵人·最後，我們不厭煩瑣的再說，在前綫者，旣非陸軍。亦非海軍，所有者袛是眞正打成片的嚴肅的日軍將士之羅姿。（翊：譯自二月十二日西部朝日新聞）</p>

<p>於二月二十三日，繼着特魯吉諸島之後，向馬利亞納羣島開始全面的攻擊，敵軍戰意，極其激烈，但日海軍飛機之必勝意氣，更見濃厚，於二十二日傍晚，接着發見敵機動部隊之報吿，即以實擊機厥實行夜間的强製，將敵航空母艦一般：大型軍艦三艘加以擊沈之外，擊毀航空母艦一艘，獲得偉大的勝利。</p>
<h3 id="c42">攻擊隊踴躍啓程 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>二十二日晨，日某航空基地，充滿着擊滅敵軍的情緒，自未明找索敵飛機，在某曹長指揮之下，向着遙遠的海上飛行，迂回了索敵預定綫，不久在下面的密雷裏，發見着敵機動部隊航駛後的波跡。某某島東方四百七十哩地點，敵兵力最少有航空母艦〇艘以上，配上戰艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦的機動部隊一軍。接着索敵機這樣報吿的基地，驟然緊張。出發的準備旣然完妥，第一次攻擊隊便奉命起飛了。將挫折敵軍侵犯日南洋領土之企圖與否。繫在此行·這時基地的上空為密電籠罩·夜的黑帷將要包住大地了。第一陣起飛之後，於深夜裘接着某上校指揮的第二陣出發，黎明時又有某中尉指揮的第三陣攻擊隊踴躍上了征途。</p>
<h3 id="c43">魚雷命中敵艦 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>第一次攻擊隊，受　觸接　的引導，直向戰塲，將近天明的天上，也沒有月痕掛着，洋上是濃墨一般的黑暗。第〇隊〇〇機頗續在暗中索找敵軍凡若干十分，突然由側面遭受敵航空母艦起飛的夜間戰鬥機的攻擊，色彩　樣的曳光彈，發響飛過，這舞間前而看到航空母艦的影隊，擴着被猛烈的防空砲火園住了。進向着舷　，打出魚雷，一方面擊退敵戰鬥機，而趕速地避退·回額一看敵航空母艦的尾巴處冲上　白的波浪，接着能熊的火焰把全艦團團抱住，眞是無我的　間呀，攻擊的任務完畢後，即單架飛返原防去。某曹長看見黑增的海上遙遠那邊兩處着火焚燒，不一會大型的敵艦沉沒海中，明確地看見擊沉敵艦，飛機員不禁呌快起見，在這激烈的防　砲火與夜間戰鬥機的桃戰下，而且於不易識別東西的　夜裏，能夠獲得這些戰果，可說是天佑吧。</p>
<h3 id="c44">接連擴大戰果 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>某大尉指揮的第二次攻擊隊，一到戰塲，敵夜間戰鬥戰一齊襲擊而來，日機各架，排除敵戰鬥機的猛烈妨礙，直向敵艦撲上去，使眼目眩或的敵軍防本砲火及在暗夜上空飛併的曳光彈，令人覺得懷愴之整。遠遠的海上，中了日機的魚當的　艦，發火焚燒，輝照整夜裏的天空。將近黎明的時候，某大尉指揮的當擊機第三次攻擊隊，到了戰塲，便對敵軍加以最後的攻擊，擊沉大型敵軍艦十艘，攻擊完　後，老練的某大尉搭乘之眞察機，淸楚了地價察决戰塲附近的海上。已經不看見敵艦的形骸，海面一帶浮現着重油等，確認了攻擊敵的戰果。（弘譯自三月五日讀賣報知）</p>

<p>國對英美的　復轟炸，最近愈趨激烈化。本月入日英美空軍轟炸柏林，參加的飛機，聞達二千架。據外電所傳，英美飛機的機員爲一萬二千，參　出　的司令部員並地上勤務員，推算起來，不下五萬人。對此迎擊的德　飛機約一千架，地上砲火隊約五十萬人，因是參加此次空戰的雙方兵員，約達六十萬名。</p>
<p>英美空軍的陣容由重轟炸機，輕轟炸機和重戰鬥獲組成，其比奉爲三·三·一，偵察機隊先從基地向目標的都市，探測氣候，拍電報回去報吿。</p>
<p>接到電報後，散怖英國南部的各基地，選擇炸彈和機樓，開始出動。普通每一基地，散佈飛機約十二三架左右，欲集合飛機百架，就須從七八處基地，飛往特定　點編隊。戰鬥機都隊當先，次為重轟炸幾，其上空左右，由戰鬥機護衛。重轟炸機的四角，更有「空中要塞」的巨機，不載炸彈，內裝機關砲機關槍十四門，担任空中巡邏任務、</p>

<p>— 沙壤</p>
<p>夜問，淅瀝淅瀝整整下了一夜雨。早晨，天還是陰沉沉的，西北風刮得刺人骨頭。</p>
<p>美琳睜着大眼睛失眠了一夜，天亮的時才朦朧睡去，然而不多一會却又驚醒過來，看一看手上戴的那支「亞米茄」牌情巧玲瓏的手錶，正是九點半鐘。</p>
<p>她忙亂着穿着衣服，小手指尖覺得有些冰冷冷的，這纔發覺到屋子裏的火爐老早熄掉了隨即高聲低喊地咀駡着。</p>
<p>「張媽，張媽：」</p>
<p>房門慢慢的推開了，張媽幽靈似的悄悄的溜了進來，滿臉帶着笑容：「小姐，辰光還早，你不多睡一會兒？」</p>
<p>「不耍費話，你這老不死的，這兩天年販把你給漲呆了，你看爐子老平熄掉，把我都要凍僵了！」</p>
<p>「是，是，讓我就燒起來。」張媽謙卑的答應着，動手來弄火爐。</p>
<p>美玲跳下了床走到梳裝臺的大鏡子前，把頭頻下最後的紐扣扣好。迥轉」了一個身前後照了一照，那金黃色的織錦緞閃爍的發養光，纏繞着一個田條丰瀾的身軀。連續幾天緊張的生活却讓她那嬌嫩的臉頰上增添了幾分憔悴，顯出焦黃的顏色。她覺得心煩意亂，滿懷亂嘈嘈的感覺、不耐煩的嚷道：</p>
<p>「噲，噲，你先去給我打一盆洗臉水來，噢，再給我弄些點心，快，快我就要出去。」</p>
<p>「是，不過……」</p>
<p>「什麽？少費話，快夫！」</p>
<p>「不過昨天晚上老爺吿訴我說請你上午在家裏不要出走，那位趙少爺今天來……」</p>
<p>一够了，够了，我眞不要聽這種費話，老爺看得中的人都是那種死板板文縐縐的書呆子，你還記得嗎，年除夕來吃年飯那個姓戚的小子，當我給他斟酒的時，慌得連酒杯都碰到地上去。哼，我眞看不起遠般沒有用的東西！」</p>
<p>鏡子裏的美琳小嘴一撇，做出一種不屑的神氣。隨着抬起右手來很熟習的做了一個美妙動人姿豐</p>
<p>在她那件高貴灰背大衣上，又套上了一件USA，最新出品的透明雨衣，外面的小雨又開始飛落了。</p>
<p>張媽從外面探頭進來說，「小姐，三輪車已經在門口等候直啦。」</p>
<p>美琳在鏡子襄做了最後一瞥，拿了那支獎得膨漲非凡的手提包，走下扶梯然後對張媽說「不要等我吃飯！」隨即鑽進了車棚。</p>
<p>這是年夜五的早晨。街頭上冷淸淸的，北風從她的旗袍下侵襲她的全身，禁不住打了兩個寒　。</p>
<p>「小姐到什麽地方一！車夫出了弄堂以後這樣的問。</p>
<p>「老北門，台子上！美琳的嗓音有些發顫，半因為是冷，一半是興奮。他不自禁的用手去摸那皮包襄的鈔票。同時，她也不禁想起了她那美麗。精緻的存摺。</p>
<p>她對她那銀行存摺上的數字有着很深刻的印象。——去年，她廿歲的元旦，那數目字整整是一萬元，那些錢是從她彌月就開是積蓄的。她當然對於一過年有着特別好感，每個新年，總可以加上一二個整整。一百，二百，千，二千，……</p>
<p>去年元旦，爸爸親手一把那大紅的存摺親手交給她說：一琳，按照法律上說，廿歲該成年人了，這筆錢應該歸你自已保管，不過，希望你能好好保存它，利用它！」</p>
<p>同學小瑛的父親是個營業公司的老間，美琳間接的托她做做股票，在大年在的前些日子，股業出淸了，銀行在摺上的錢數是六萬七千元。當然應談請請客，D．D．S．的一頓夜飯用去四千，不禁石些心痛。那天酒喝得有些醉薰無。同小瑛跳了幾個快步「華爾滋」。簡直有些天旋地轉了，客人中，有人提議到「台十上」去「白相一·第一個贊成的是小瑛的父親，他是一個老手了。隨着一唱百合，大隊人馬浩浩蕩蕩出鐵門向南而去。這在美琳却是有生第一次，特別覺得新鮮有趣。她居然飽戰而歸，補價了她請客的損失而有餘。好一個生財有導的勾當</p>
<p>學校放了假；閒，悶：於是她又想起那個令人刺激興奮的地方。她想：瞧吧，這會比做股票要快捷得多，我會自己積存起一個很大的數目而不必破費任何的酬謝請客的費用。我要置到像小瑛騎的一槍牌」的脚踏車、買架新的增你智「留聲機·還要一支比小李手上更大鑽戒！</p>
<p>於是她每天瞞住她爸爸，媽媽，向那個地方跑</p>
<p>美夢漸漸的破碎了，存摺上的數目字一天天很快的減少下去。五萬，四萬，三萬……在大年夜那天下午她趕到銀行門口，司務已經門在拉鐵門了她已經不在做那美麗的黃金夢。却祇暗暗的祝禱：「上帝呀！恢復我原來的狀况吧！一然而上帝的却不降臨在那個地方！</p>
<p>元且，初二·初三初四，她成天的留速在那裏。初四的夜半、她頹喪的回到家中，機出了最後的八疊鈔票，塡眾進皮句裏·同時她把皮包裏那支存褶找着惋惜的放到抽層襄去。今天該是最後的希一望了，天哪！保佑我吧！</p>
<p>車停住在「紅寶」的門口，　熟習的向小朗擺一擺手就鐵　那門口的帘幕。</p>
<p>一陣悶熱而令人　　的空氣撲到她冰冷的臉上、像一陣火，很快的灼熱了她的兩頰。霎時間灼熱了她的全身，灼熱她的胸藏　地看到台十上高聳着的一堆一堆府拾即是的鈔票，她那希望的火焰又像噴泉樣的飛騰求來。這時·她好像是個勇敢的鬬十、手提包裏是她的戰器，她准備開始向敵人拼命了</p>
<p>一開啦！「三通寶女作手尖銳的呌聲·</p>
<p>她走到那挪擠的台子前，一個穿着單衣服的敗下陣來，她立刻塡補他那個空隙。</p>
<p>語個台子上的一三通棄，已是連開九記「大。數碼記錄簿上是整整的兩列「紅」字。腦子襄陡的又飛出來那個胖子傳先生所灌輸的哲學理論名詞；辯證法的「質與量的互變律」！</p>
<p>「大」的量該積增的够了吧！她心襄盤算着：</p>
<p>——那麽，應當變一質一了！「小」！</p>
<p>她打開皮包，喳！一疊鈔票擲到「小」上。心襄充滿了自信。</p>
<p>「好：開一記小啦，大小姐，帮帮儂的忙，開出小米，多吃一大烟」！</p>
<p>那位妖嬈的般花眉飛色舞的同她搭訕着，隨着送過來一碟又乾又小的橘子。</p>
<p>「開來：開　！開！三五六，十四點大！」那滿臉脂粉的　東女孩子熟練把寶缸開開來，跟着，很逼眞的作了一個惋惜的嘆息：</p>
<p>「哎，這嚴子太不帮忙！」</p>
<p>不過倒還鎮静。還是那樣盤選着：</p>
<p>——「大」的量又增加了；一質」變的可能也更增加了，「小」——</p>
<p>於是兩疊鈔票，喳！那麽東女孩子又生硬的打着上海白：</p>
<p>「好：再拉」一記，這次一定開小！」</p>
<p>「開啦，開！雙五一隻二，十二點大！連路啦！——廣樂女孩子同美琳做了一個鬼臉。美琳勉强的做着不經意的笑·從皮包表抽出一支香烟，好像很悠閒似的吸着。前額開始滲冒着汗珠，手指頭冰冷，臉頰鮮糽滾燙。</p>
<p>——十一記「大」！鬼東西！非打小不可！鬼</p>
<p>四疊鈔票，喳，喳，喳，一喳開！羅，雙四，一支三，十一點眼眼大！」</p>
<p>——十一點！鬼，「量」這麽多！「質」變怎麽……鬼……糟……六萬七……可惜……怎慶辦！」</p>
<p>美琳眼前有些金屋在飛舞，耳朶裏亂嘈嘈的美聲，咀駡聲。嘩呌聲。她呆呆的望着缸裏的三粒嚴子，那設子好像擴大起來，成了三棵枯髏。</p>
<p>她下意識的把那最後一疊鈔票丟在「小」上，她低下了頭，再沒有勇氣看那缸子，祗是低聲嘰咕着：</p>
<p>「變「質」……變……「小」「質與量的互變律」！……」然而那廣東女孩子的勝音，似一股强烈的電洗：</p>
<p>「三支六啊！」夹着這一羣人的嘩呌，好像雷樣的吼聲，從她耳邊喊起，她像要往後倒下去了，幸而後而有人堆擠住她給她撑住身軀。</p>
<p>——完了，完了！</p>
<p>一霎時，成了一個戰敗的傷兵，她已沒有半點力氣。她下意的，掙扎着擠出人羣，她無目的地在盡是人，她盲目的走東　西，擠來擠去。她祇有單純的一個念頭，怎麽辦！怎麽辦！怎麽辦！</p>
<p>她伸手到皮包裏去，再也找不出一張票子來了，也許手指太不中用了吧，她想把腦袋伸進去找找看。她走到那　　亮的汽燈下面，又很仔細搜查一遍，她完全絕望了。沒有一此　助，沒有一個人同情，心現破碎了，肉體分解了！怎麽辦！怎麽辦！回去吧，不行，六萬七，爸爸媽媽怎麼能。她好像要癱軟在地上混身沈頭，得支持不住了。</p>
<p>在那樓梯口旁，慘綠色的霓紅燈在發着光，紳經陸然一震：押，當，押？當？當？她想到姑母送她廿歲正壽的禮物：錶！</p>
<p>拉開左手的衣袖·那支金黃色，洗綫型的「亞米茄」在閃爍的發着光。那是她最心愛的東西啊？當它嗎？</p>
<p>——不行！可是，六萬七千的數目字，在她眼前跳躍着，她不甘心，她還想做最後的掙扎。——祗有一綫的希望了！她在那押當門口徘徊着，她的脚步勝躇不前，她從來沒有做過這種事情。——羞恥啊！下流啊！然而希望同欲念的火焰不斷的跳邊着，咀嚼她的心，她咬着</p>
<p>那精緻的手錶脫離了她的手腕，她迷惘的拿着兩疊紙幣，像個夜遊人似的又走向那擁擠的人嚴</p>
<p>祗一陣風這個泡沫就粉碎了，在那配攘的人海裏，這泡沬並沒有激起似毫的漪瀾，雖然這泡沫是無可挽救的毀滅了！</p>
<p>然後又是那單純的念頭：怎麽辦！怎麽辦！</p>
<p>她腦袋裘空洞洞的，像泡沫一樣的空洞。她袛有把希望渲染在空洞的泡沫上！她還想再激起一個新的泡沬來維持她的希望了！</p>
<p>她再迷惘的走進了押當。</p>
<p>迷惘的又出來。她當了她的雨衣同皮外套！</p>
<p>身上露出那棟金色耀眼的織錦緞旗袍。</p>
<p>坐在三輪佈喪。她混身打着抖，北風殘酷的浸蝕着她的身體。</p>
<p>張媽開了大門用　奇的眼光打量着她。她垂着頭走上了樓梯，　開自己的房門。房十裏里漆漆的，火爐在屋角的黑暗裏，跳躍着暗紅的火焰。眼眶下充滿了淚水，那火焰幻成了無數的紅蛇。蜓延着·跳躍着。她並不去捻亮房裏的燈，他祇是在無目的撲索着，她的手觸着那支站櫃，下意　的拉開抽屜，摸出那支存擱，她很熟悉那精巧長方形輸緋。灶胡亂的嗣勸着它，在優弱的火光裏，她還能依稀的辦認出那寸大的　記——付訖！</p>

<h3 id="c47">足聯賽最精彩之一幕　車華僑聯大戰前瞻　深望東研究戰術强敵 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>本星期日上午十時半·在逸園有足球聯賽一塲，允為聯賽中最精彩之一幕。對壘者，係常勝軍東華隊過義將變相之僑聯隊。按目下形勢表而觀　自聯誼隊突吿退出聯賽以後，因無變動，東華仍以不敗戰績，榮居首席，所餘二戰，一即為僑聯，另一塲為一警隊。兩戰中祇須保持一次和局，對錦標即毫無問題，故此點已不値得重視，所重者，能否保持常勝軍榮銜耳。觀僑聯前週以五對三壓倒聯誼之雄姿，確巳恢復當年或展，東華過之，未必十分樂觀，據筆者加以分析及貢獻東華戰策，上為智者千慮必有一失之助。</p>
<h3 id="c48">先就聲勢心理而言 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>依東華之聲勢，所向披糜，為保持其不敗戰績，自當發揮其力量，如此心理方面，有非勝不可之雄心，當能同心協力，克底於成，致僑聯隊在聯賽中固已毫無希望：僅爲名次之爭。與聯誼一役，振奮以赴，可見其聲勢方面，亦並不弱於東華隊也。更乏，其心理方面，頗具壓倒常勝軍之野心，蓋義將自隸三省體育會後，生活安定則食君之祿，忠君之事，此舉之得失，報效於主人者綦大。故在義將之心理上，亦有非，勝不可之勢，由此而論，聲勢心理，幾無分軒輊，</p>
<h3 id="c49">再論兩隊攻守實力 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>東華隊攻勝於守，前鋒五將俱在顚峯狀態中，兩翼之佳，實勝於他隊，唯後防似稍見戰弱。尤以門將張邦綸不能臨大敵而鎮靜，為量大之缺憾。僑聯義將，前鋒無東華之銳利。但全隊極見平均，無特殊之優點，亦少顯著之缺點。全隊能攻能守，個個嬌健。最可貴者，為門將麥尼蒂有一夫當關萬人莫敵之概，其球到人到之作風，在滬上尙前無古人。故總論之，東華攻實較僑聯為勝，守則似無僑聯之穩，守門相差甚大。欲預測勝負，各有成份，難加斷言，而一塲血戰·必為球迷所矚目。萬人空巷，則可斷言。我人除欣賞球藝之外，更寄重於我東華者必殷，筆者對東華略貢蕘之獻。</p>
<h3 id="c50">東華進攻應取竄勢防守切忌衝得太前 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>僑聯綠麥尼蒂之門，想用强硬脚頭打破殊難，必須用速度竄進至近門處，輕撥進門，最易得手，亦為麥尼蒂最怕之一着。好在東華有韓龍海賈幼良李垚頗能辦到，希望　麟經孫錦順多作供給三將竄進之機會，則麥門將無以發其狠勁也。更　譚福楨近中錢相近得球，可從速挑向右路賈幼良韓龍海之間是時以龍海之速度，可竄進擋住某後衛，由幼良從容撥球，此爲最可應用之容術。況譚善此一記，拂球（近見少用）何樂而不爲耶？至東華之守術，遮住二十碼近門區城之射門，絕少漏洞。唯僑聯之飽傑及卡伯維均善在二十碼以外放冷箭，準確峻急異常，此點似非李莊所能顧及，則極顧邦綸極力注意外，尙希梁樹棠用其全力以纏住或試與張林根對調位置。蓋張身胚較大，長力較足，如是當能阻對方之遠射也。總之，東華之守衛，切忌衝得太前，前衛應注意對方內鋒，後衛注力於兩翼，勇中取智，則無有不成之理。</p>

<p>嘉興體育塲因籌募建築費·特邀本市華影籃球隊赴禾作表演賽。該隊精神極佳，在西靑聯賽中頗得觀衆好評。就球藝言·原有可觀，加以影星當號召力，禾地人士，罕睹廬山眞面。一日蒞臨，哄動自在意中。該地之遠道來聘，良非無因，華影隊亦以義不容辭，整軍出發，於月前搭早車赴禾。除隊員外，同行者有顧問白川及領隊李大深，交際你欣夫史久磐，另有襲秋霞張帆陳娟奶楊柳張敏珠吳增英及滑稽明星關宏達等之啦啦隊，惟四姊妹中之二姊陳琦未能偕行為遣感耳。記者亦承邀往，隨軍出發，乃作隨軍記不負此行。</p>
<p>車於上午十時開行，抵禾十二時十分，當地歡迎者即導至大中國飯店進午餐。本定當日下午即有籃球比賽，唯以對抗隊伍亦自蘇州邀請，突以火車謏時，須下午六時後能到，故勢不能舉行。乃臨時邀請女星客串歌舞，亦所以厚收入也。消息甫經傳出，頃刻問售票至五百張以外，女星以鑒於影迷之愛戴，欣然久之，在中華大戲院影戲完塲之後，大展歌喉。楊柳「交換」，陳娟娟「戒烟歌」，張帆「賣糖歌」，製秋霞一審薇處處開」「莫忘今宵」受盡影迷之歡迎，尤以襲秋霞之一曲，幾風靡一時，誠名不虛傳。</p>
<p>全體均借宿於烟雨　，樓居南湖中央四面皆水，居淸凈無比，臥楊用器，均饒有日本化。久居都市，偶一蒞此，頓覺心曠神怡，煩惱全消，憑欄俯視，波平如鏡，舉首仰望，月淡星稀，而水色濛瀧，雲影隱釣，則又別具風致，令人呌絕，俄而歌聲發於水上，婉轉悲切。夜深聞之，倍感凄凉。蘇十瞻所謂「如泣如訴，如怨，如慕，舞幽壑之潛蛟，泣孤舟之嫠婦」。此情此景·彷彿似之，猶憶記者新婚，曾到此度蜜月，今舊地重臨，往事歷歷，而伊人已成黃土屍骨，不禁悲從中來，慘然欲淚，噫！吁！早知有是回憶，眞悔多此一行矣。</p>
<p>球賽於次日上午十一時在嘉興中學舉行，華影對平光（蘇省立二中之校隊）由該塲長蒲憶萍梅熹（脚傷不能作戰）為裁判員，開始後華影以藝勝一籌，節節佔先。上半時以十二對七，終結果二十對十，華影凱旋。觀華影此次戰術用五人防法，守時地位之佳，無以復加，對方實難覓隙而入，禾地人士、嘆為觀止。對方靑年學子，長力較勝，故全賽奮勇到底，能比數之不十分直上，即以此因，華影全隊用命，均有功積，而平光隊略以經騐較差，球路缺乏，內地有此戰積，良非易事。</p>
<p>賽畢，略事休息。仍返大中國飯店午膳，總幹事吳文超以出征事均告完畢，得勝而回，乃勸痛飲數杯，記者深嗜杯中物，不覺與同鄉陶繼鱉君大杯暢飲，漸入醉鄉，以後行止，不復記憶。唯在車聲轆轆中，似漸淸醒，及扳抵滬站，已晚間九時餘，乃雇車返寓，隋軍記，即此結束。</p>

<h3 id="e1">A Word to the Wealthy in Society <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discussion on "Supporting the Police Consumer Cooperative" listed the weighty responsibilities borne by the police. However, the current treatment they receive is undeniably meager, making the comparison between the two extremely disproportionate and unreasonable. Therefore, while demanding that the police fulfill their duties, we must also consider adjusting their treatment and improving their living conditions. Only when their lives are secured to a minimum extent can we impose upon them the heavy responsibilities they should bear. This is a matter that should be considered in both theory and practice. Frankly speaking, if we only talk about responsibilities without considering actual living conditions, the police may not be able to fulfill their duties, and they may not be able to do anything about their own lives. Under such circumstances, the police will inevitably prioritize solving their own living problems as the first and foremost task, and regard fulfilling their responsibilities as secondary. If we calmly observe the current situation, it is very likely to evolve to this point. This is something that all citizens, especially leaders from all sectors of society, should jointly recognize.</p>
<p>During this decisive phase of the Greater East Asia War, this city occupies an important base at the rear, and contributing all its strength to the war effort is an irrefutable responsibility. However, exerting all our strength is not a simple matter. It requires planning, organization, steps, unity from top to bottom, mutual cooperation, and gradual progress. And the most important prerequisite is that all internal efforts must be supported by external safeguards. Only then will such efforts not be in vain and will achieve the desired results. The so-called "external safeguards" are to ensure and maintain public order. Therefore, maintaining public order is a prerequisite for ensuring all forces participating in the war. This is a point that should be recognized by all.</p>
<p>Moreover, the closer the front lines are to the crucial decisive phase, the more deliberate sabotage by the enemy will be discovered in the rear. Therefore, maintaining public order, defending the territory, policing against traitors, and ensuring combat power are even more important. Whose responsibility is this after all? Of course, the local police bear the most arduous responsibility. We can say that maintaining public order is the responsibility of the local police, while improving the lives of the police so that they can serve with peace of mind is the joint responsibility of the government authorities and all the people of the city.</p>
<p>Now, Chen, the concurrent director of the First Police Bureau, and Deputy Directors Du and Su have initiated the organization of a police consumer cooperative to gradually improve the lives of the police. The cooperative is actively preparing and is first requesting a loan of 40 million yuan from influential figures from all walks of life. The details have been published in yesterday's newspapers. We would like to sincerely appeal to leaders in the city's industrial and commercial sectors and those with wealth to pay attention to the importance of police responsibilities and improving living conditions, as well as the relationship between maintaining public order and Shanghai's security. Please assist the police consumer cooperative and generously lend funds so that it can be established as soon as possible. Moreover, although the cooperative is not a commercial profit-making entity, it often has inventory, which serves as collateral for the loan. Interest is also stipulated and repaid in installments, which is definitely not comparable to donations. The cooperative has set a deadline for raising the full amount of funds by the end of this month. We hope that...</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that Mr. Ye Fuxiao and Mr. Lin Kanghou from the city's banking industry association, Mr. Yuan Ludeng from the city's chamber of commerce, and Mr. Wen Lanting and Mr. Zhao Jinxiang from the Citizens' Welfare Association have enthusiastically supported the organization of the cooperative. Particularly admirable is the fact that the Central Reserve Bank authorities have lent 2 million yuan and Mr. Sheng Youhui, chairman of the Central Asia Bank, has lent 1 million yuan, taking the lead in advocating. Other trade associations such as those in tobacco leaves, new medicines, matches, and chemical industrial raw materials have also lent huge sums. Xinwen Bao and this newspaper have also each lent 100,000 yuan to show their support. It is expected that leaders from all sectors of society, who have always been enthusiastic about public welfare and spare no effort, will surely follow suit, unite their efforts, and promote its success. This will not only be a blessing for the lives of the police but also for the future of Shanghai's public order.</p>

<h3 id="e3">German Troops Enter Hungary; Stojay Forms a Cabinet; Assists Germany in the War Based on Mutual Understanding <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a government bulletin released by the Hungarian News Agency yesterday afternoon: Based on mutual understanding between Germany and Hungary, German troops have already entered Hungarian territory. This measure is based on the joint operations of the Tripartite Pact countries to assist the country in resisting the common enemy, and especially to mobilize all forces to strengthen self-defense and counter Bolshevism. The governments of the two allied countries have decided to continue the spirit of friendship and joint operations between the two countries and strive for the final victory for the German and Hungarian people. As for the resignation of the Hungarian cabinet, Regent Horthy Admiral has ordered former ambassador to Germany, Stojay (Doeme Szeojay), to form a new cabinet, the list of which is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister and Foreign Minister: Stojay</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without Portfolio: Layci</p>
<p>Minister of the Interior: Yolosh</p>
<p>Minister of Finance: Snayoy</p>
<p>Minister of Industry: Yaos</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Transportation: Cond</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture and Supply: Jujeck</p>
<p>Minister of Justice: Temporarily taking charge of Church Affairs and Education: Chatay</p>
<p>Minister of Defense: Satui</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Hungarian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojay was born in Budapest on January 5, 1880. During the First World War, he served in the General Staff. In 1932, he was appointed military attache in Berlin, and in December 1935, he was appointed Hungarian ambassador to Germany, dedicated to the friendship between Germany and Hungary. Marshal Stojay is a representative of the Hungarian military, proving to be a continuation of the joint operations with the German army on the battlefield of the World War.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday's announcement stated that the German leader, upon the recommendation of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, appointed Dr. Fossenmanb as the German ambassador and plenipotentiary to Hungary. The former ambassador to France, Yago, has been recalled to the Foreign Ministry.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Hungary Orders Dissolution of Social Democratic Party <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Budapest, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After German troops, according to the agreement between Germany and Hungary, entered Hungarian territory from the west and south at dawn on the 19th, they were smoothly deployed along the railway lines and base areas near Hungary's capital, cooperating with the Hungarian police in security. The Hungarian government has ordered the dissolution of the Social Democratic Party, and the left-wing Napsava newspaper has also been ordered to cease publication. The domestic order is quite orderly, and the public is very calm. The number of German troops entering Hungary's capital is quite small, and the situation in the city has hardly changed. However, gatherings are prohibited. The wartime system in Hungary has always been slightly less tense than in Poland and Romania. However, from the day the German troops entered, the radio station stopped broadcasting, showing a renewed spirit. The new Hungarian cabinet will strive to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers and improve the wartime system. As far as the German army is concerned, although the Lviv-Odessa railway has been cut off, it is necessary to use the Budapest (Hungary)-Bucharest (Romania) railway trunk line to prevent the Soviet army from advancing. Politically strengthening Hungary's domestic defense, consolidating the rear defense of Hungary and Romania, and further strengthening the war of all allied countries, Germany, after consultation with the Hungarian government, adopted this security guarantee policy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Huitong News Agency: Political circles here have expressed their enthusiastic welcome to the establishment of the new Hungarian government and the German-Hungarian joint defense agreement. Political observers commented on the official bulletin of Budapest last night, stating that Hungary now understands its obligations and responsibilities to Europe. Measures will be taken to resist communism, and steps will be implemented to eliminate defeatist elements in the country. Because the strength of the Hungarian army is insufficient to defend the border alone, German troops arrived in Hungary to assist the Hungarian army.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Intensification of the European Air War Before the Opening of the Second Front <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Before the unfolding of the Second Front, England, America, and Germany indeed initiated a preliminary battle, bombing each other. The war forces on both sides are now concentrated on bombing each other's cities. In the current war situation, the significance of bombing cities carries extremely important characteristics. Based on the materials that Lisbon was able to obtain, I will report on the situation of the Anglo-American bombing war against Germany and its differences:</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>There have long been criticisms of England's indiscriminate bombing of German cities. Mr. Biff opposed it in the Upper House, calling it blind bombing, but the government answered indifferently that this was a planned action. England calls the essence of this urban bombing strategic bombing, while other bombing is called regional bombing, destroying and burning the entire city.</p>
<p>In 1941, Germany's bombing of London and other places did not use its fighters elsewhere, but only damaged Britain's military and production facilities. The US bombing was also designed for the purpose of military bombing, but Britain manufactured bombers for the purpose of urban bombing, and urban bombing became the main purpose of bombing. This is a fact seen since last year. Before this, 70% of the British bomber fleet were twin-engine medium-sized bombers with limited range and bomb load. Now, most of them are large four-engine aircraft, such as Lancaster, Halifax, and Shillings. Therefore, the bombing method is also different from Germany and the United States and has its own characteristics.</p>
<p>The design of British large bombers can sacrifice armor and combat power to carry as many bombs and incendiary bombs as possible, with the principle of mixed throwing of bombs and incendiary bombs. The bombs are large, averaging 3.5 tons loaded by American aircraft. Therefore, when a thousand aircraft bomb, it reaches 3,500 tons. Urban bombing aims to destroy the entire city, and its focus is on incendiary bombs. Bombs are used to destroy transportation, waterways, and other fire-fighting equipment, anti-aircraft guns, and other ground air defense equipment, causing artificial winds to expand the fire. Therefore, incendiary bombs are specially dropped in places that cause fires. The result is not expressed in destroying specific targets, but only in dropping a certain number of tons of bombs and incendiary bombs in a certain area within a certain time.</p>
<p>During the bombing of Brunswick on January 14, 90 tons of bombs were dropped in one minute. Incendiary bombs. The highest record is 150,000 tons in one minute. Whether it is a school or a hospital, everything within a certain area is completely destroyed. This method is also called carpet bombing. Therefore, a large number of bombers have to be used. Its preparation also requires a long time and a large amount of materials. The technology of urban bombing is progressing fastest in England.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the selection of the destination, which is carefully decided by the Intelligence Bureau and other agencies, and "the US also participates in opinions." The political and military production centers are the primary targets. Regarding the latter, the most attention was paid to the location of submarine manufacturing factories, and now it is aircraft factories. The attack method is to use heavy bombers to form a large team, and recently it has been attached with long-range bombers. The time is in the evening. Previously, it was only limited to moonlit nights that could identify targets, but recently, special thick dark nights are chosen to avoid sacrifices. This is possible due to the technological advancement of aviation law. First, meteorology must be advanced. Bombing is carried out by masking the shock layer, and the time to return to the base can be determined so that it will not be hindered by sudden and deteriorating weather. A surprise attack from England to Berlin and other places requires a considerable amount of whiteness, so it is very necessary to predict the weather.</p>
<p>Secondly, the use of radio wave detectors to detect the direction is also quite developed, and night flight is not considered a hardship. The third is the progress of the guide plane. This is a Mosquito, Lancaster, and Halifax with special equipment, and specially trained personnel sit in it and depart in front of the team. They use special sighting devices to find the target and plan when to bomb where, dropping various colors of flares. The main team sees these flares and can concentrate bombing in a certain time and place, even in the dark. The bombing of Hamburg and Berlin used this method.</p>
<p>This attack method has also changed Germany's defense methods. Using anti-aircraft guns and searchlights to defend from the ground is completely useless in this concentrated bombing, so it has become a method of using large and powerful night fighters to shoot down bombers. Therefore, the losses of the British heavy bombing teams with weak combat power have increased. The enemy chooses cloudy dark nights in order to hinder the activities of night fighters.

<h3 id="e6">Actively Strengthen Combat Power, Implement Victory: Summary of Speech by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo spoke at the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the 22nd, and the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>I would like to take this opportunity to say a few words about the government's determination to deal with the current major war situation. In order to adapt to the development of the war situation, the government decided on the outline of the current national administration at the end of September last year, and immediately took emergency measures. Recently, officials and civilians have worked together and made extraordinary efforts. In terms of combat power, especially the air force's combat power has been increasing day by day. This matter does not need to be repeated. The war situation is now increasingly tense, and the situation does not allow for a moment's hesitation. Therefore, new measures have been taken to closely integrate the command and state affairs. At the same time, the government, with emergency and extraordinary measures, decided on the "Outline of Extraordinary Measures for a Decisive Battle", and adopted a clearer policy for domestic administration. This extraordinary measure has completely gathered all the strength of the people to strengthen combat power, so as to complete the system of certain victory. In order to achieve a complete victory, the government will continue to study the best policies and adopt all necessary means. It has also launched a strong national general mobilization movement to boost combat power, increase production, ensure food supply, and defend the territory. At present, the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia have unanimously and closely cooperated to overcome various difficulties, and aim to destroy the Central Powers. The United States is again determined to construct a new order in Greater East Asia, and is working hand in hand to move forward. The spirit of struggle and the sincerity of cooperation with Japan of the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia are truly admirable. At this time, the Indian National Army led by Jiang Tela Bous has closely cooperated with the Japanese army and is advancing towards India. What Japan expects from India is to return India to the Indians. Therefore, the land of the motherland India obtained by the National Army will all enter the administration of the Provisional Government of Free India. It is indeed a necessary reason. Today, it is fortunate to see India achieve independence and take a big step forward. It can be imagined. Looking at the European allies again, Germany has overcome various difficulties and has now restored its strong resilience. Its morale is even more boosted, and it is taking an offensive against England and the United States, which is extremely exciting for us for a long time, and we wish it more courageous fighting and strive to accomplish its great cause in the future. The war situation is now extremely serious, and the enemy is increasingly eager to force us, which is giving us the opportunity to annihilate the enemy and obtain an excellent opportunity to open up a path to certain victory. I firmly believe that the 100 million people will do their best to eliminate any suffering they encounter, actively and enthusiastically strengthen their combat power, so as to achieve the final victory.</p>

There was only local warfare on the Narva River front on the northern route.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to frontline reports, the main force of the Soviet army under General Konev, which crossed the Nistru River in the Yangbo area, attempted to cross the northern Bessarabian plain and advance to the Yasi area, the western strategic point on the Inut River. The main force of the German army has now gathered in front of Barchi, enhancing the counterattack along the Chernokichi-Barchi railway line. At present, fierce battles are successively being fought between the two sides in the area 22 miles southwest of Droryichi Ayambori. Another part of the Konev army, from Solokaki South, directed the attack on the railway from Odessa to Yasi. The German army is currently conducting an ambush battle east of a point 20 miles north of the railway.</p>

<h3 id="e15">Making the Recovery of Liberated Areas Favorable for the Expansion of Operations: Bose Clarifies Two Major Obligations for the Future <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from a certain Japanese army base in Burma on the 23rd, Commander Subhas Chandra Bose issued a statement on the 21st in the afternoon regarding the Indian National Army's breakthrough of the border. He met with a group of Japanese and Burmese reporters and answered their questions. The Q&amp;A is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Question: What are your thoughts after the National Army broke through the border?</p>
<p>Answer: We are very satisfied that our National Army has stepped onto the soil of our motherland. At the same time, we feel even more keenly the great responsibility of defeating the British and Americans. Although the territory regained this time is small, it is still a pioneering achievement to be able to expel enemy troops with our own national army since 1857, which is truly deeply moving.</p>
<p>Question: What is the significance of the National Army's breakthrough of the border?</p>
<p>Answer: Britain has suffered successive defeats on various battlefronts around the world, and still naively believes it is absolutely undefeated in India. Now, it has been defeated by us. This is enough to show that Britain is gradually losing its power to defend India.</p>
<p>Question: What impact will this breakthrough of the border by the National Army have on the Indian soldiers in the British-Indian army and the Indian masses?</p>
<p>Answer: The impact of this breakthrough will become clear in a few days. In the past, the Indian people failed to understand our actions. This breakthrough of the border by the National Army will surely prompt them to awaken. Indian soldiers will also come to join our ranks as time goes on, and it will further make the Indian people confident that they can defeat Britain with their own strength and confirm that Britain is bound to be defeated. I will never engage in exaggerated propaganda, but only hope to crush Britain's attempts with the facts that will gradually be realized in the future.</p>
<p>Question: After the National Army's breakthrough of the border, how will the independence movement be advanced?</p>
<p>Answer: We now have two major obligations: one is to make the expansion of operations favorable, and the other is to restore the liberated Indian territories. The provisional government will promote ideal administration, which will have a great impact on other territories that have not yet been liberated.</p>
<p>Question: What will Britain's attitude towards India be in the future?</p>
<p>Answer: Britain will definitely increase its military strength to attempt to retake the territories that we have recovered, intensify its negative propaganda against Japan, and further suppress the Indian people.</p>
<p>Question: What impact will this have on the Chongqing regime?</p>
<p>Answer: When I attended the Greater East Asia Conference and broadcast to Chongqing from China, I appealed to the Chongqing side, hoping that they would recognize reality and cooperate with Japan, and not engage in wars between people of the same race again. At that time, it coincided with the Chongqing side's participation in the Cairo Conference, and Britain and the United States tried their best to flatter the Chongqing side, so the Chongqing side turned a deaf ear to my loyal advice. However, not only are Britain and the United States unable to help Chongqing, but they are already in a difficult situation where they must abandon their ambition to counterattack Burma. Therefore, the Chongqing side has been greatly affected. If this operation continues to progress further, the anti-Axis leaders within the Chongqing camp will also gradually reflect.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Air Defense Headquarters Decides to Improve Air Defense Streetlights: Streetlights Throughout the City Will Be Restored with Reduced Light <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Since the permanent blackout went into effect in this city on the 3rd of this month, the results have been good. However, some criminals have taken the opportunity to become active, and robbery cases have occurred repeatedly, which has greatly affected public order. Therefore, the police authorities are implementing special security measures. The Civil Air Defense Headquarters of the city, regarding the issue of improving streetlights, also convened a meeting of standing directors to discuss the matter, and a decision has been made to improve them. Streetlights throughout the city will be restored, but the light will be reduced. Except for the 60-candlepower lights at major traffic intersections, all other ordinary streetlights will be reduced to 15-candlepower, and black cloth will be added to the sides to make the light shine downwards. At the same time, red and green traffic lights will also be opened as usual to maintain traffic safety. This improvement plan has been agreed upon by the headquarters and various lighting companies, and the replacement is underway, which is expected to be completed and lit up within a few days.</p>

<p>The First Police Bureau of this city, in order to prevent criminals from committing crimes under the blackout, issued a statement the day before yesterday, saying: "Recently, public order in Shanghai has deteriorated, which is regrettable. The authorities deeply feel that the responsibility is heavy, and in the future, they will cooperate with the military authorities and devote all their efforts to maintaining public order in the city. For unscrupulous elements who take advantage of the blackout to commit crimes, we are determined to punish them severely. We hope that the general public, on the one hand, will pay attention to locking their doors, and on the other hand, will go out as little as possible at night, especially women. We hope that they will actively cooperate with the bureau in this measure."</p>

<p>Mr. Mitsuo Miyazaki, president of the Allied Japan Yomiuri Shimbun and president of the Burma Shimbun, departed from Japan to take up his new post in Burma. He passed through this city en route. He was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai by plane the day before yesterday, but the flight was delayed and changed to yesterday. The Shanghai Press Association had already prepared to welcome him the day before yesterday, but also changed the reception to noon yesterday and hosted a banquet at the International Hotel. President Miyazaki also hosted a return banquet for the press of this city. Due to time constraints, it was held immediately during the seating, and everyone shared the meal.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Attendees <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Miyazaki, accompanied by Mr. Yoshikazu Koyama, Shanghai branch manager of Yomiuri Shimbun, Mr. Shotaro Miyake, deputy manager, and Mr. Yoshikatsu Nakagawa, Hankou branch manager of the same company, arrived on time. Also present were Major Izubuchi, head of the Army Press Department, Colonel Matsushima, head of the Fleet Press Department, Mr. Matsudaira, head of the Information Department of the Embassy Office, Mr. Murakami of Mainichi Shimbun, Mr. Nomura, director of Asahi Shimbun, Mr. Kawasaki of Domei News Agency, Mr. Bisaka and Mr. Akamatsu of Tairiku Shimpo, Mr. To Kabo of Chunghua News, Mr. Chen Bin Su of Shen Bao, Mr. Jin Xiong Bai and Mr. Lu Guangjie of Ping Bao, Mr. Jiang Xiaoguang and Mr. Zong Jingze of Kokumin Shimbun, Mr. Lu Feng and Mr. Wang Ping of Shin Chuka Shimpo, Mr. Hidaka of Shin Shen Bao, and Mr. Cheng Zhongquan and Mr. Zheng Hongyan of Sin Wan Pao, totaling more than fifty people.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Remarks During the Meal <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lu Feng, chairman of the board of directors of the Press Association for the month and representing Shin Chuka Shimpo, delivered a welcoming speech, stating: "Burma is on the front line of the Greater East Asia War. The Indian National Army is assisting in the war and has charged into the country. Its position is extremely important. Now that Mr. Miyazaki is going to that place to engage in news reporting, we are greatly impressed. He will surely be able to exert the power of his position and be beneficial to winning the Greater East Asia War." Then, Mr. Koyama, Shanghai branch manager of Yomiuri Shimbun, delivered a speech, stating: "Yomiuri Shimbun has its current status and success due to Mr. Miyazaki's greatest efforts. Mr. Miyazaki is over fifty years old, but he does not complain about hardship and serves in Burma on the front lines. He truly has the spirit of youth and is worthy of emulation." Subsequently, Mr. Miyazaki delivered a reply speech, stating: "The Greater East Asia War has now reached the decisive stage. The Indian National Army has penetrated into its motherland, which is a bright guarantee for the future of the Greater East Asia War. Wherever our Japanese Imperial Army defeats the enemy, our press workers should also arrive at the same time. This is the mission of wartime journalists. I am going to Burma this time and plan to stay for a year and a half to engage in work. I hope to receive your guidance in the future." During the meal, Mr. Matsushima, director of the Fleet Press Department, delivered a speech, explaining the certain victory of the Greater East Asia War, especially in the Burma-India area, that is, the victory of the war has been determined since the National Army entered its motherland. He also expressed his respect for Mr. Miyazaki's past contributions and recent efforts to the press. At the end of the banquet, Mr. Chen of this newspaper delivered a speech, stating: "Today's banquet, without distinction between guests and hosts, is like a family gathering, which can symbolize the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and there is no distinction between guests and hosts. Especially China and Japan are brotherly countries, with the same script and culture, and the relationship is even closer. I just heard Mr. Koyama say that Mr. Miyazaki is over fifty years old and does not complain about hardship to work on the front lines, which is certainly commendable. However, recently, Mr. Tokutomi, a veteran of the Japanese press, published an essay entitled 'Idle Talk on the Current Situation,' proposing 'Serving the Country with Age,' encouraging the people to shorten their age by ten years and serve the country, that is, a sixty-year-old person does the work of a fifty-year-old, and an eighty-year-old does the work of a seventy-year-old. Then Mr. Miyazaki is just a strong man in his fifties, who is at the normal age to work for the country. Mr. Miyazaki said that he plans to go to Burma for a year and a half. We would very much like to hold a grand welcome party when Mr. Miyazaki returns to Shanghai at the end of next year. However, perhaps by next year, Mr. Tokutomi will propose shortening the age by twenty years to serve the country, then Mr. Miyazaki will be a young man of thirty, who especially needs to work hard. We sincerely wish Mr. Miyazaki's spirit will get better year by year, and his career will flourish year by year." Finally, Mr. Bisaka, head of Tairiku Shimpo, delivered a speech, stating: "I have worked with Mr. Miyazaki in Tokyo for many years. He is a veteran of the press, serving for more than thirty years. The close cooperation between China and Japan should start from the press. The relationship between the Chinese and Japanese press in Shanghai is very close now. Not long ago, we entertained Mr. Takaishi, president of Mainichi Shimbun, and today we are entertaining Mr. Miyazaki, which is a concrete manifestation of the close relationship between the press."</p>

<p>The First District Office announced: From March 25th to April 2nd, the 66th issue of rationed rice and flour will be sold by various retail rice stores in this district and by the rice warehouses of this office. During the above-mentioned period, citizens may purchase two sheng of white rice with the 66th rice purchase coupon bearing the registered number noted on the coupon, for a price of 23 yuan in national currency, and purchase one jin of Number Two flour with the 66th flour purchase coupon at the same rice store, for a price of 10 yuan in national currency.

<h3 id="e24">First District Office Improves Rationing Methods: Comprehensive Ration Card to Be Issued Starting in May <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Since the merger of the First, Eighth, and West Shanghai districts, the Economic Department of the First District Office has been striving to improve rationing matters and methods, striving for simplicity to ensure people's livelihood. Yesterday, Mr. Wang Mai, chief of the General Affairs Section of the department, explained in detail the following points of improvement to the reporter:</p>
<h3 id="e25">Numbers Printed on Each Coupon <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The department currently handles the rationing of seven items: rice, flour, oil, sugar, coal briquettes, matches, and soap. In the past, separate ration coupons were issued for each item, and the purchasing procedures were frequent, which was quite troublesome for citizens to obtain the coupons. In order to simplify the process, the department decided to issue a comprehensive ration card starting in May. Each person will receive one card, and thirty numbers, numbered 1 to 30, will be printed in separate boxes on the card, with the registered number of the retailer noted. However, which item can be purchased with which number will be announced by the authorities at any time. Residents can tear off the number printed on the card and purchase from the designated retailer. At the same time, the registered numbers of retailers for various items will also be adjusted starting in May. Regardless of the store where the item is purchased, each card will be assigned a single number, and the store number will be based on the rationing merchant closest to the resident's home, so as to facilitate residents' purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e26">West Shanghai Eighth District Under Unified Management <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>All rationing matters in the former West Shanghai Eighth District will continue to be handled by the department starting in the next issue. No. 57 Changan Road has been designated as the issuing office and is currently under renovation. Before the renovation is completed, it will be temporarily handled at No. 234 Huangpo Road (formerly Route Paul Henry). Furthermore, the rationing matters in the former Eighth District will also be under the unified management of the district, and the designated issuing locations are: No. 2 Nanhai Road (formerly Rue Fuli Li) for Taishan and Lujiawan districts; No. 485 Guilin Road for Luoyang and Petain districts; and No. 234 Huangpo Road (formerly Route Paul Henry) for Huangpu and Xiaodongmen districts. As for the coupon obtaining and rationing matters, they are exactly the same as in the First District.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Household Increases and Decreases to Be Reported at Any Time <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the former Eighth District and West Shanghai District did not accommodate the increase or decrease in household registration or the reissue or return of purchase coupons. After the department took over, it was decided to follow the old First District method for the above-mentioned situations. After obtaining a certificate from the neighborhood chief, the household registration tax receipt should be attached at any time, and the application for adding or returning the coupon should be reported to the designated coupon issuing office. Finally, it was mentioned that the addresses and registered numbers of the retailers of various items in the department will be adjusted uniformly starting in May to meet the needs of citizens and facilitate them.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Special Consumption Tax in Various Districts Must Be Reported and Paid by the End of the Month <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance was ordered to handle the special wartime consumption tax. It has been levied since January 16th of this year in 15 key city and county areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, first levying the special consumption tax on retail items and banquets and hotels. It has been two months since then. In addition to the Shanghai urban area, other districts are newly established, and merchants and the public may inevitably be unclear about certain aspects. Although tax revenues in several districts are considered good, there are still some merchants and the public who procrastinate and fail to pay, and there are quite a few who attempt to evade taxes. In order to adjust tax policies and increase treasury revenue, the department has specifically ordered merchants and the public in various places to report and pay all taxes payable from now until recently in accordance with the law. Otherwise, those who fail to report and pay after the deadline will be severely punished in accordance with the law.</p>

The day after tomorrow (Sunday) at 10:30 AM, the甲組(First Division) team Donghua will meet the Overseas Chinese team again. The football association authorities, in view of the inevitable crowding of fans, have decided to increase ticket prices starting tomorrow. Yesterday, the association issued a notice stating: "In view of the limited number of seats in the stands of the stadiums, and the fact that the number of spectators at each event exceeds the limit, resulting in disorder and difficulty in maintaining order, the stadium owners and the police authorities are quite dissatisfied. Therefore, it has been decided that starting this weekend, the price of tickets for matches at both the逸園(Yiyuan) and Jiaozhou Parks will be increased uniformly, to 40 yuan per ticket for ordinary seats and 80 yuan per ticket for special seats, in the hope of limiting the number of people and maintaining order in the stadium."</p>

<p>Following the establishment of a 100 million yuan loan for wheat purchase with the Chinese and Japanese banking groups, the Flour Professional Committee has also jointly borrowed 50 million yuan from the two banking groups for flour purchase funds. The loan method is an overdraft of collateralized nature, using the warehouse flour certificates as collateral, with a term of six months and an interest rate of 8% per annum. The function of this fund is to purchase flour from various factories for unified distribution, but at the same time, it has a side effect on flour mills, that is, it can enable various factories to have funds to reissue acceptance bills and continue to purchase wheat. When buying flour from various factories, the committee will pay 20% of the purchase price in cash, and the remaining 80% will be used by the committee to repay the acceptance bills opened by the factory to the bank for purchasing wheat. In the future, if the factory needs to purchase wheat, it can continue to apply for acceptance bills. Regarding the flour mills under the control of the committee, there are 43 factories in the three provinces and two cities, including 12 in Shanghai, 4 in Suzhou, 11 in Wuxi, 8 in Changzhou, 1 in Zhenjiang, 1 in Yangzhou, 2 in Nanjing, 1 in Wuhu, 2 in Bengbu, and 1 in Taizhou.

<h3 id="e38">South Pacific Frontline: Army and Navy Cooperatively Build the Battlefield <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Thousands of miles from the motherland, the decisive battleground in the South Pacific, centered on New Britain Island, is continuing day and night in a bloody and tireless death struggle. Everything in that decisive battleground cannot be procured locally, so in addition to fierce fighting, the soldiers must also engage in construction warfare, and their labor is probably indescribable. In particular, the naval units escort transport ships fully loaded with troops, crossing the ocean under the enemy's aerial bombs and the enemy's潜水体(submarine force) activities, their labor is no less than that of the army units. This kind of collaborative army-navy desperate landing warfare, tireless to the death, with torches blazing and a well-practiced fighting spirit, is the true face of the frontline soldiers.</p>
<p>Linking New Ireland, New Britain, and New Guinea is a line that, for Japan, is the outer perimeter line of defense of the homeland and an important base line for operations in the South Pacific. Therefore, the enemy relies on its vast resources and numbers and wants to break through this line and come to wage a war of attrition. In island warfare with extended supply lines, the soldiers are fighting to the death against the enemy and nature, and they are suffering in every way. The army units' ammunition and rations must rely on the cooperative transport of the naval units due to the islands and terrain. Moreover, in the enemy's air superiority zone, there is the danger of group bombing, and the transport ships that painstakingly reach their destination will sink to the bottom of the sea if the unloading work is slightly delayed. There are many such examples. This is unknown to the soldiers fighting to the death on the front lines, but the desperate unloading work is being carried out under these circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Cooperative Landing Operations <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>On Bougainville Island, the army and navy had long been cooperatively engaged in landing operations, truly demonstrating a valuable spirit of unity. Previously, on New Georgia Island, a naval officer served as commander of both the army and navy. When the army commander arrived, he replaced the naval officer as commander of both forces. This was not unique to New Georgia, but also occurred in New Guinea. The relationship between them was not merely "close," but from the beginning, they functioned as a single unit. Last year, on [date redacted], elite army aircraft, having decimated the enemy on Lontuba Island, eagerly departed from the [location redacted] base. One surviving aircraft, directing its course toward Lontuba Island, while patrolling the skies over Bougainville Island, suddenly spotted dozens of fighter planes. Initially mistaking them for enemy aircraft, upon closer inspection, they were indeed naval planes, coming to join the attack on Lontuba Island. The army aircraft, as if receiving a million reinforcements, their courage redoubled, braved intense anti-aircraft fire, and bombed enemy military installations. Upon confirming their successful strikes and beginning their return, the enemy's anti-aircraft fire was extremely intense, and a large number of friendly aircraft were hit. Lieutenant Ando's aircraft, in particular, could not reach base, and he was forced to prepare for self-destruction or parachute at any moment. Though the aircraft's gunner had his thigh pierced by enemy fire, he acted as if nothing had happened, continuing to fire while sucking on an oxygen tube, until he collapsed in a pool of blood.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Ando continued to operate his damaged aircraft, attempting to return to friendly forces. With only twenty more minutes until they could return to Bougainville Island, the altitude was fortunately maintained at [number redacted] meters, but the landing gear had been destroyed, and a safe landing was impossible. Without a moment's hesitation, Lieutenant Ando, though knowing Lingering Root Beach [literal translation] Island was now within sight, resolved to land on the large sandy beach of the nearby isolated island. At once, the aircraft body swung to the left, abruptly facing the bank, and at this moment, the canopy had already flown off. Fortunately, the aircraft did not catch fire. A vehicle sped towards them like the wind, carrying naval garrison members. The garrison members, overjoyed at their safe return, were moved to tears and immediately transported Lieutenant Ando and the other crew members to the camp in the vehicle, treated their wounds, and offered them wine, showing a level of kindness not even extended to members of their own unit. Everyone was at a loss for words to express their gratitude, said Sergeant Rightmilling [literal translation] to the reporter when recalling the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Constructive Cooperation <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The close cooperation between frontline army and navy forces is evident not only in combat operations but also in construction efforts. In the disease-ridden isolated islands of the South Pacific, nothing can be procured locally. From camps to roads, everything is made by the soldiers themselves. As the fighting becomes more intense, transportation becomes more difficult. To prepare for any eventuality, they must research methods for local food self-sufficiency, making their labors beyond description. Unlike the navy, the army units do not have mobile kitchens. If they consumed the crops of the indigenous people, the locals would starve, so in their spare time between intense battles, the soldiers cultivate the land as part of their combat duties. They have already cultivated many fields of various crops, achieving a state of self-sufficiency at the minimum level, which is a powerful asset for future operations. The navy also has many farmlands, opening up paths for local supply. The army and navy, hand in hand, march forward, striving to defeat the Americans and British, fighting day and night. No matter how the enemy counterattacks, they remain as unshakable as stone. Therefore, even those in the rear, in this unprecedented national war, must rise up and unite the front lines and the rear to destroy the enemy. Finally, we reiterate without reluctance that those on the front lines are neither army nor navy. All that exists is the solid visage of truly united, solemn Japanese soldiers. (Wing: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, February 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Mariana Sea Night Attack Record of Lightning Strike Aircraft <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>On February 23rd, following the Truk Islands, a comprehensive attack was launched on the Mariana Islands. The enemy's will to fight was extremely fierce, but the Japanese Navy's determination to win was even stronger. On the evening of the 22nd, following a report of the discovery of an enemy mobile task force, a lightning strike was decisively carried out at night, sinking three enemy aircraft carrier-type large warships, and destroying one aircraft carrier, achieving a great victory.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Eager Departure of Attack Squadrons <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd, a certain Japanese airbase was filled with a determination to annihilate the enemy. Early in the morning, search aircraft, under the command of Sergeant Major [Name redacted], flew towards the distant sea, circling along the planned search line. Soon, they discovered the wake of an enemy mobile task force sailing below. At a location 470 miles east of [island name redacted], the enemy force consisted of at least [number redacted] aircraft carriers, along with battleships, cruisers, and destroyers forming a mobile task force. As soon as the base received this report from the search aircraft, it was thrown into a flurry of activity. With preparations complete, the first attack squadron was ordered to take off. Whether or not the enemy's attempt to invade Japan's South Seas territories would be thwarted depended on this mission. The skies above the base were now shrouded in secrecy, and the black curtain of night was about to envelop the earth. After the first wave took off, a second wave, commanded by Colonel [Name redacted], departed late at night. At dawn, a third attack squadron, commanded by Lieutenant [Name redacted], eagerly embarked on their expedition.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Torpedoes Hit Enemy Ships <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The first attack squadron, guided by [unclear reference], headed straight for the battlefield. In the pre-dawn sky, no moon hung, and the ocean was as dark as ink. The [number redacted] aircraft in the [number redacted] squad, after searching for the enemy in the darkness for many tens of minutes, suddenly came under attack from enemy night fighters taking off from an aircraft carrier on the flank. Tracers of various colors flashed past. Moments before this, the shadows of the aircraft carriers were visible, surrounded by fierce anti-aircraft fire. Advancing towards the side, they launched torpedoes, repelled enemy fighters, and quickly retreated. Looking back, they saw white waves erupting from the stern of the enemy aircraft carrier, followed by raging flames engulfing the entire ship. It was a truly selfless moment. After completing the attack, they flew back to their original defense sector individually. Sergeant Major [Name redacted] saw two fires burning far away on the dark sea. Before long, a large enemy ship sank into the sea. Having clearly witnessed the sinking of the enemy ship, the airmen could not help but exclaim with joy. It can be said that it was divine providence that they were able to achieve these results under such intense anti-aircraft fire and the challenges posed by night fighters, and in the obscurity of the night where it was difficult to distinguish directions.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Continuous Expansion of Battle Results <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The second attack squadron, commanded by Captain [Name redacted], was immediately attacked by enemy night fighters upon arriving at the battlefield. Each Japanese aircraft, overcoming the fierce interference of the enemy fighters, plunged straight towards the enemy ships. The blinding enemy anti-aircraft fire and the tracer rounds flying in the dark night sky created a scene of solemnity. Far away on the sea, an enemy ship struck by a Japanese torpedo burst into flames, illuminating the entire night sky. Near dawn, the third attack squadron, commanded by Captain [Name redacted], arrived at the battlefield and launched a final attack on the enemy forces, sinking ten large enemy warships. After completing the attack, the experienced Captain [Name redacted], aboard his reconnaissance aircraft, clearly surveyed the sea near the battlefield. The shapes of enemy ships were no longer visible, and heavy oil and other debris floated on the surface, confirming the results of the attack on the enemy.

<h3 id="e45">New Tactics of the German Air Force <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The country's retaliatory bombing against Britain and the United States has become increasingly intense recently. This month, British and American air forces bombed Berlin, with reports that as many as two thousand aircraft participated. According to foreign news reports, the aircrews of the British and American aircraft numbered twelve thousand. Including the headquarters staff and ground crew involved, it is estimated that no fewer than fifty thousand people were involved. Against this, the German aircraft numbered approximately one thousand, and the ground artillery units numbered approximately five hundred thousand. Therefore, the total number of personnel on both sides participating in this air battle reached approximately six hundred thousand.</p>
<p>The British and American air force formation consists of heavy bombers, light bombers, and heavy fighters, with a ratio of 3:3:1. Reconnaissance aircraft first probe the weather from the base to the target city and report back via telegram.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the telegram, the various bases scattered throughout southern England choose bombs and aircraft, and commence departure. Ordinarily, each base has about twelve to thirteen aircraft. To assemble one hundred aircraft, it is necessary to fly to a specific point from seven to eight bases to form a squadron. Fighter units lead the way, followed by heavy bombers, with fighters escorting them from above and to the sides. At the four corners of the heavy bombers are giant "flying fortress" aircraft that do not carry bombs but are equipped with fourteen machine guns and machine cannons, tasked with aerial patrol.</p>
<p>At the same time, the optical unit uses large numbers of short strips of paper and mica sheets covered in aluminum foil. When over enemy territory, the paper strips can disrupt the radar targeting systems, preventing them from accurately tracking, while the mica sheets reflect sunlight during the day and searchlight beams at night. Only shimmering light is visible in the air, making measurement with optical instruments extremely difficult.</p>
<p>German fighter units first engage the enemy fighter units, then attack their heavy bomber units. Recently, to cause the entire enemy squadron to collapse, they have been using fragmentation shells, which explode in the center of the enemy squadron, with considerable effect. These shells, even if they do not hit enemy aircraft, detonate within the enemy formation. (Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, March 11th) -</p>

<h3 id="e46">Bankbook <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Sandy Plain</p>
<p>Last night, it drizzled and drizzled, raining all night long. In the morning, the sky was still gloomy, and the northwest wind was piercingly cold.</p>
<p>Meiling had been wide awake with insomnia all night, only falling into a hazy sleep as dawn broke. However, she awoke with a start a short time later, looking at the delicate "Omega" watch on her wrist, it was already half past nine.</p>
<p>She hurriedly got dressed, her fingertips feeling a little icy. Only then did she realize that the stove in the room had gone out long ago, and she loudly and quietly cursed.</p>
<p>"Zhang Ma, Zhang Ma!"</p>
<p>The door slowly pushed open, and Zhang Ma quietly slipped in like a ghost, her face full of smiles: "Miss, it's still early, why don't you sleep a little longer?"</p>
<p>"Stop talking nonsense, you old hag, you've been numbed by the New Year's bonuses these past two days. Look, the stove has gone out, and I'm freezing!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I'll light it right away." Zhang Ma humbly replied, starting to work on the stove.</p>
<p>Meiling jumped out of bed and walked to the large mirror on the dressing table, fastening the last button on her collar. She spun around once, looking at herself in the mirror. The golden brocade glittered, enveloping her voluptuous figure. The stressful life of the past few days had added a touch of weariness to her delicate cheeks, giving them a sallow color. She felt agitated, filled with a chaotic feeling. She impatiently exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, go and get me a basin of water to wash my face, oh, and get me some snacks, quick, quick, I'm going out."</p>
<p>"Yes, but..."</p>
<p>"What? Stop talking nonsense, hurry!"</p>
<p>"But last night the master told me to tell you to stay home this morning, that young master Zhao is coming today..."</p>
<p>"Enough, enough, I really don't want to hear this nonsense. The people the master approves of are all those dull, bookish pedants. Do you remember that young man surnamed Qi who came to eat New Year's dinner on New Year's Eve? When I poured him wine, he was so flustered that he even knocked the wine glass to the ground. Humph, I really look down on such useless things!"</p>
<p>Meiling pursed her little mouth in the mirror, making a disdainful expression. Then she raised her right hand and struck a beautiful and charming pose very expertly.</p>
<p>Over her expensive gray wool coat, she put on a transparent raincoat, a new product from the USA. The light rain outside had started to fall again.</p>
<p>Zhang Ma poked her head in from outside and said, "Miss, the rickshaw is already waiting at the door."</p>
<p>Meiling took one last glance in the mirror, picked up her unusually bulging handbag, walked down the stairs, and then said to Zhang Ma, "Don't wait for me to eat!" She then climbed into the rickshaw's hood.</p>
<p>It was the morning of the fifth day of the New Year. The streets were deserted and cold, and the north wind invaded her entire body from under her cheongsam, making her shiver twice.</p>
<p>"Where to, miss?" the rickshaw driver asked after leaving the alley.</p>
<p>"Old North Gate, the platform!" Meiling's voice trembled slightly, partly because of the cold, partly because of excitement. She couldn't help but touch the banknotes in her handbag. At the same time, she couldn't help but think of her beautiful, exquisite bankbook.</p>
<p>She had a very deep impression of the numbers on her bankbook. - Last year, on her twentieth birthday, the number was exactly ten thousand yuan. That money had been accumulated since she was a month old. Of course, she had a particularly good feeling about New Year's. Every New Year, she could add one or two whole numbers. One hundred, two hundred, one thousand, two thousand...</p>
<p>Last New Year's Day, her father personally handed her the big red bankbook and said, "Ling, according to the law, twenty years old is adulthood. This money should be kept by you, but I hope you can take good care of it and use it well!"</p>
<p>Her classmate Xiao Ying's father was a senior manager at a business company. Meiling indirectly asked her to play the stock market. In the days before the New Year, the stocks were cleared out, and the amount of money in the bankbook was 67,000 yuan. Of course, it was proper to treat everyone, and a dinner at D.D.S. cost 4,000 yuan, which was a little painful. That day, she drank some wine and got a little tipsy. She danced a few fast waltzes with Xiao Ying. She felt a bit dizzy. Someone in the group suggested going to "The Platform" to "play." Xiao Ying's father was the first to agree, as he was an old hand. With one voice supporting the idea, a large group of people marched out of the iron gate and headed south. This was Meiling's first time, and she found it particularly new and interesting. She actually returned with a full victory, more than making up for the loss of her treat. What a way to make money!</p>
<p>School was on vacation; she was idle and bored. So she thought of that exciting and stimulating place again. She thought: Look, this is much faster than playing stocks. I can accumulate a very large number myself without having to spend any reward or treat fees. I want to get a "Spear" brand bicycle like Xiao Ying rides, buy a new [brand name redacted] "gramophone," and a diamond ring even bigger than the one on Xiao Li's hand!</p>
<p>So she hid it from her father and mother every day and ran to that place.</p>
<p>Her dreams gradually shattered, and the numbers on the bankbook decreased rapidly day by day. Fifty thousand, forty thousand, thirty thousand... On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, she rushed to the bank gate, but the doorman was already pulling the iron gate. She was no longer dreaming that beautiful golden dream, but secretly prayed: "God! Restore me to my original state!" But God's blessing did not descend on that place!</p>
<p>The first, second, third, and fourth days of the New Year, she lingered there all day long. On the evening of the fourth day, she returned home dejectedly, rummaged out the last eight stacks of banknotes, and stuffed them into her handbag. At the same time, she found that bankbook in her handbag and regretfully put it in the drawer. Today should be her last hope, oh God! Protect me!</p>
<p>The rickshaw stopped in front of "Ruby's" door. She waved familiarly to the young man and went through the doorway curtain.</p>
<p>A wave of sultry and unpleasant air rushed to her cold face, like a flame, quickly scorching her cheeks. In an instant, it scorched her whole body, scorching her chest. Seeing piles and piles of easily available banknotes piled high on the platform, the flame of her hope soared up again like a fountain. At this time, she was like a brave fighter, with her handbag as her weapon, preparing to fight the enemy desperately.</p>
<p>"Open it!" the sharp cry of the "Three Dice Treasure" girl sounded.</p>
<p>She walked to the crowded platform. Someone wearing a single layer of clothing had been defeated and had withdrawn. She immediately filled that gap.</p>
<p>The One Three Dice game on this platform had already opened nine consecutive "Big" rolls. The numbers recorded in the record book were two full columns of "red" characters. The philosophical theory that fat Mr. Chuan had instilled in her suddenly flew back into her mind: the dialectical "law of the interconversion of quality and quantity"!</p>
<p>"Big"'s quantity should have accumulated enough, right! She thought to herself:</p>
<p>--Then, it should change to "quality" -- "Small"!</p>
<p>She opened her handbag, wham! A stack of banknotes was thrown onto "Small." Her heart was full of confidence.</p>
<p>"Good: Opened 'Small,' miss, help me out, open a small roll so I can get my fix!"</p>
<p>That enchanting Guangdong girl flirtatiously struck up a conversation with her, then handed over a plate of dry, small oranges.</p>
<p>"Open it! Open it! Open! Three, five, six, fourteen points, big!" The girl with her face covered in powder skillfully opened the treasure bowl, and then put on a very realistic sigh of regret:</p>
<p>"Hey, these dice are not helping!"</p>
<p>However, she remained calm. She was still planning:</p>
<p>-- "Big"'s quantity has increased again; the possibility of a "quality" change has also increased, "Small"--</p>
<p>So two stacks of banknotes, wham! That Guangdong girl spoke Shanghai dialect again in a businesslike tone:</p>
<p>"Okay: bet again, this time it must open small!"</p>
<p>"Opened it, opened it! Double five, one two, twelve points, big! Straight run! -- The Guangdong girl made a face at Meiling. Meiling forced a casual smile. She pulled a cigarette out of her handbag, appearing very leisurely as she smoked. Her forehead began to perspire, her fingers were ice-cold, and her cheeks were flushed.</p>
<p>--Eleven consecutive "Big"! Damn it! It has to be "Small"! Damn --</p>
<p>Four stacks of banknotes, wham, wham, wham, with one wham open! Double four, one three, eleven points, big! --</p>
<p>--Eleven points! Damn, so much "quantity"! How can the "quality" change... Damn... Sixty-seven thousand... What a pity... What to do!"</p>
<p>Meiling's eyes were seeing gold stars, and her ears were filled with the noisy voices, curses, and cheers. She stared blankly at the three dice in the bowl. The dice seemed to enlarge and turn into three skulls.</p>
<p>She unconsciously threw the last stack of banknotes on "Small." She lowered her head, no longer having the courage to look at the bowl, only muttering in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Change 'quality'..." Change... "Law of the interconversion of quality and quantity"!..." However, the sharp sound of the Guangdong girl seemed like a strong electric shock:</p>
<p>"Three sixes ah!" Accompanied by the shouts of the crowd, like thunder, resounding in her ears, she seemed about to fall backward. Fortunately, someone behind her was pushing against her, supporting her body.</p>
<p>--It's over, it's over!</p>
<p>In an instant, she became a defeated soldier, no longer having any strength. She unconsciously, struggling, squeezed out of the crowd. She was aimlessly among the people, blindly walking east and west, bumping into everything. She only had one simple thought, what to do! What to do! What to do!</p>
<p>She reached into her handbag, no longer able to find a single bill. Maybe her fingers were too useless. She thought about sticking her head inside to look. She walked under the bright gas lamp and carefully searched again, but she was completely desperate. There was no help, no one sympathized, her heart was broken, her body was collapsing! What to do! What to do! Go back, no, sixty-seven thousand, what would her father and mother say. She seemed about to collapse on the ground, her whole body sinking, unable to support itself.</p>
<p>Beside the stairs, the ghastly green neon light was shining, and her nerves suddenly jolted: pawn, pawn, pawn? She thought of the gift her aunt had given her for her twentieth birthday: the watch!</p>
<p>Pulling back her left sleeve, the golden, streamlined "Omega" shone. It was her most beloved thing! Pawn it?</p>
<p>--No! But the number sixty-seven thousand was jumping before her eyes. She was unwilling, she wanted to make one last struggle -- there was only a glimmer of hope left! She lingered in front of the pawnshop entrance, her footsteps hesitant. She had never done such a thing before -- Shame! Immoral! However, the flames of hope and desire continued to dance, gnawing at her heart. She bit her lip.</p>
<p>The delicate watch left her wrist. She took the two stacks of banknotes in a daze, like a sleepwalker, and walked back into the crowded crowd.</p>
<p>But this foam shattered in one gust of wind. In the bustling sea of people, this foam did not stir up the slightest ripple, although this foam was irreparably destroyed!</p>
<p>Then it was that simple thought again: what to do! What to do!</p>
<p>Her mind was empty, as empty as foam. She only had to paint her hope on the empty foam! She wanted to create a new foam to maintain her hope!</p>
<p>She walked into the pawnshop in a daze again.</p>
<p>She came out in a daze again. She pawned her raincoat and coat!</p>
<p>Revealing the dazzling golden brocade cheongsam on her body.</p>
<p>Sitting in the rickshaw, her whole body was shaking, the north wind ruthlessly eroding her body.</p>
<p>Zhang Ma opened the door and looked at her with strange eyes. She lowered her head and walked up the stairs, opening the door to her room. The room was dark, and the fire in the stove in the corner was leaping with a dark red flame. Her eyes were full of tears, and the flames turned into countless red snakes, creeping and leaping. She didn't bother to turn on the lights in the room. She was only groping aimlessly. Her hand touched the nightstand. Subconsciously, she opened the drawer and took out the bankbook. She was very familiar with the delicate, rectangular, scarlet treasure. She aimlessly caressed it. In the dim light, she could still faintly recognize the inch-large inscription -- Paid!</p>

<h3 id="e47">One of the Most Exciting Scenes in the Football League: A Preview of the Tung Wah vs. Overseas Chinese Athletic Association Match, Deeply Hope that Tung Wah Studies Tactics to Overcome Strong Opponent <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM this Sunday morning, a football league match will be held at the Recreation Ground, promising to be one of the most exciting scenes in the league. The contestants are the ever-victorious Tung Wah team and the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association team, which has transformed with foreign players. According to the current standings, since the Cosmopolitan team suddenly announced its withdrawal from the league, there have been no changes. Tung Wah still holds the top spot with an undefeated record. The remaining two matches are one against the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association and the other against the Police Force. As long as they maintain one draw in these two matches, there will be no problem for the championship. Therefore, this point is no longer worth emphasizing. What is important is whether they can maintain the title of the ever-victorious team. Considering the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's impressive performance of defeating the Cosmopolitan team 5-3 last week, they have indeed regained their former glory. Tung Wah's victory is not entirely optimistic. According to the author's analysis and contribution to Tung Wah's tactics, it will help wise men avoid oversights.</p>
<h3 id="e48">First, Let's Talk About Momentum and Psychology <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Based on Tung Wah's momentum, they are invincible. In order to maintain their undefeated record, they will naturally exert their strength. In this psychological aspect, they have the ambition to win at all costs. They should be able to work together and achieve success. The Overseas Chinese Athletic Association team has no hope in the league, only competing for rankings. The match against the Cosmopolitan team was exhilarating, showing that their momentum is not weaker than Tung Wah's. Furthermore, in terms of psychology, they have the ambition to overwhelm the ever-victorious team. Since the foreign players joined the Three Provinces Athletic Association, their lives have become stable, and they are loyal to their masters. The success or failure of this move greatly repays their owner. Therefore, in the foreign players' psychology, there is also a situation where they must win. From this perspective, momentum and psychology are almost equally important.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Let's Discuss the Offensive and Defensive Strengths of Both Teams <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Tung Wah's offense is better than its defense. All five forwards are at their peak. The excellence of the two wings is indeed better than other teams, but the defense seems to be slightly weaker. In particular, goalkeeper Zhang Banglun's inability to remain calm in the face of formidable opponents is a major shortcoming. The Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's foreign players do not have Tung Wah's sharp forwards. However, the whole team is very balanced, without special advantages or significant disadvantages. The whole team can attack and defend, and everyone is strong and healthy. The most valuable thing is that goalkeeper McNulty has the spirit of one man guarding the gate, invincible to ten thousand. His style of getting the ball to the person is unprecedented in Shanghai. Therefore, in general, Tung Wah's offense is better than the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's, but the defense does not seem as stable as the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's, and the difference between the goalkeepers is very large. It is difficult to predict the outcome, as each has its own strengths. However, a bloody battle will surely attract the attention of fans. It can be said that everyone will be out on the streets. In addition to appreciating the skill, we also place great expectations on our Tung Wah team. The author offers some humble suggestions to Tung Wah.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Tung Wah's Offense Should Adopt a Dashing Strategy, and the Defense Should Avoid Rushing Too Far Forward <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to break through the gate guarded by the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association's McNulty with brute force. It is necessary to use speed to dash into the near post and gently flick the ball into the goal, which is the easiest way to score and is also what McNulty fears the most. Fortunately, Tung Wah has Han Longhai, Jia Youliang, and Li Yao, who are quite capable of doing this. It is hoped that Lin Jing and Sun Jinshun will provide more opportunities for the three to dash in, so that goalkeeper McNulty will have no way to exert his ferocity. Furthermore, when Tan Fuzhen and Qian Xiangjin get the ball in the center, they can quickly pass it to the right wing between Jia Youliang and Han Longhai. At this time, with Longhai's speed, he can dash in to block a defender, allowing Youliang to calmly flick the ball. This is the most applicable tactic. Moreover, Tan is good at this flicking the ball (rarely seen recently), why not do it? As for Tung Wah's defense, they should cover the shooting area within 20 yards of the near post, leaving as few loopholes as possible. However, Bao Jie and Kabrow of the Overseas Chinese Athletic Association are good at taking cold shots from outside 20 yards, with exceptional accuracy and urgency. This point seems to be beyond Li Zhuang's ability to handle. In addition to Ji Gubanglun paying close attention, it is also hoped that Liang Shutang will use his full strength to entangle them or try to switch positions with Zhang Lingen. Because Zhang is taller and stronger, he should be able to block the opponent's long shots. In short, Tung Wah's defense should avoid rushing too far forward, the forwards should pay attention to the opponent's inside forwards, and the defenders should focus on the two wings. By being brave and intelligent, there is no reason why they should not succeed.</p>
<p>Latest news, the foreign players this time have also gained three new reinforcements, one center forward, one left wing, and one center back, preparing to make a desperate gamble, vowing not to be reconciled if they don't win against Tung Wah. If that's the case, then since the enemy team is pouring out all its strength, it is the time for our Tung Wah to show its might and skill. May our athletes not have any discouraged feelings and overcome the enemy. Is it only the author's hope? Encourage! Encourage!</p>

<h3 id="e51">Hua Ying Basketball Team's Expedition to Jiaxing: A Camp Follower's Account by Mei Bixian <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Jiaxing Sports Ground specially invited the Shanghai Hua Ying Basketball Team to Jiaxing to perform exhibition matches in order to raise construction funds. The team's spirit is excellent, and it has received good reviews from the audience in the West Qing League. In terms of basketball skills, it was originally worth seeing, and the star power added to the appeal. People in Jiaxing rarely see the true face of Mount Lu. Their arrival one day was bound to cause a sensation. The invitation from afar was certainly not without reason. The Hua Ying team also felt obliged to organize and depart, taking an early train to Jiaxing a month ago. In addition to the team members, the accompanying members included consultant Bai Chuan and team leader Li Dashen, communication personnel Ni Xinfu and Shi Jiupan, as well as cheerleaders such as Xi Qiu Xia, Zhang Fan, Chen Juanjuan, Nai Yangliu, Zhang Minzhu, Wu Zengying, and comedic star Guan Hongda. However, the second sister of the four sisters, Chen Qi, was unable to accompany them, which was regrettable. The reporter was also invited to join the expedition and write a camp follower's account to do justice to this trip.</p>
<p>The train departed at 10:00 AM and arrived in Jiaxing at 12:10 PM. The local welcomers led them to the Grand China Hotel for lunch. A basketball game was originally scheduled for that afternoon, but the opposing team was also invited from Suzhou, and the train was delayed, so they could not arrive until after 6:00 PM. Therefore, it was impossible to hold the game. So, they temporarily invited female stars to perform songs and dances, which was also to increase revenue. As soon as the news spread, over 500 tickets were sold instantly. The female stars, in view of the love of the fans, gladly agreed and showed off their singing voices after the movie ended at the China Grand Theater. Yangliu sang "Exchange," Chen Juanjuan sang "Quit Smoking Song," Zhang Fan sang "Selling Candy Song," and Zhu Qiuxia sang "A Smile is Worth a Thousand Gold" and "Don't Forget Tonight," which were well received by the fans. Especially Zhu Qiuxia's song almost swept the crowd, and her reputation was truly well-deserved.</p>
<p>The entire group stayed at the Misty Rain Building, located in the center of South Lake, surrounded by water on all sides. The environment was extremely quiet. The bedding and utensils were all Japanese-style. Having lived in the city for a long time, one suddenly felt relaxed and refreshed, and all worries disappeared. Leaning on the railing and looking down, the waves were as smooth as a mirror. Looking up, the moon was faint and the stars were sparse, and the water was hazy and the clouds were casting shadows, which was another unique charm, making people exclaim in admiration. Suddenly, a song came from the water, gentle and sad. Hearing it late at night, it felt even more desolate. Su Shi described it as "like weeping, like complaining, like longing, like admiring, the hidden dragon dancing in the secluded valley, the lonely woman weeping in the lonely boat." This situation and scene were similar. The reporter recalled that he had come here on his honeymoon when he was newly married. Now, returning to the old place, the past events were vivid, but his wife had become a corpse in the yellow earth. He could not help but feel sad from the bottom of his heart and wanted to cry. Alas! Alas! If he had known that he would have these memories, he would have regretted taking this trip.</p>
<p>The game was held at Jiaxing Middle School at 11:00 AM the next morning. Hua Ying played against Ping Guang (the school team of Jiangsu Provincial Second Middle School). The field director Pu Yiping and Mei Xi (who could not play due to a foot injury) served as referees. After the start, Hua Ying won by skill and took the lead step by step. In the first half, they won 12-7, and the final result was 20-10, with Hua Ying triumphant. Hua Ying used a five-man defense tactic this time. The positioning was excellent, and it was impossible to improve it. The opponent found it difficult to find a gap to enter. The people of Jiaxing marveled at it. The opposing young students were better in endurance, so they fought bravely to the end, which is why the score did not go up very sharply. The entire Hua Ying team worked hard and made contributions, while the Ping Guang team was slightly less experienced and lacked basketball tactics. It was not easy to achieve this result in the mainland.</p>
<p>After the game, they rested briefly and returned to the Grand China Hotel for lunch. General Manager Wu Wenchao said that the expedition had been completed and they had returned victorious, so he urged them to drink a few cups. The reporter, who loved to drink, couldn't help but drink heavily with fellow townsman Tao Ji Bie Jun, gradually entering a drunken state. After that, he did not remember his actions. However, he seemed to gradually wake up in the rattling of the train. When he arrived at the Shanghai station, it was already after 9:00 PM. So he hired a car to return to his residence. The camp follower's account ended here.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Sports Trivia <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Slim Reporter</p>
<p>Hua Ying Basketball Team captain Shu Shi flew to Beiping on the 21st for business. The team's instructor Qian Xucang accompanied him. It is heard that Shu, in addition to his business trip, is also picking up his wife, Murong Wan'er, to return to Shanghai. Qian Jun is purely taking a plane ride and sightseeing in northern China. The expected return date to Shanghai should be at the end of this month.</p>
<p>The Three Provinces Women's Basketball Team will be visiting Wuxi this month.</p>
<p>There are many new referees in the China Youth Basketball League. For example, Jin Botao's execution is no weaker than that of ordinary veteran referees. The metabolism of the new replaces the old, is it also the case in the refereeing world? In the end, it is also a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>Qiu likes to watch Jiabei performances, because the Northern School of basketball has a different style of viewing the ball. The Tongren basketball team is also extremely loved by general fans, because the coordination is wonderful, which seems to be incomparable to other teams.</p>
<p>The China United Basketball Team has won two championships in the West Qing and Chengyou Cups this year, and its reputation is at its peak. Unfortunately, they suffered a crushing defeat to the Tung Wah team in the China Youth League last week. It is said that China United was initially slightly contemptuous of the enemy, and later its endurance was not as good as that of ordinary football players. Indeed, however, the reporter deeply feels that in addition to these two reasons, the referee's abnormality is not unrelated.</p>
<p>The city's basketball league is well-promoted, but there are few promoters for school basketball. Recently, Mr. Zhang Juefei held a college basketball game, which should be the precursor to recent school basketball. Recalling the past Jiangnan Eight University Basketball Championships from the Zhizhi Five Tigers to the momentum of Jinan, it is still vivid in my mind. This time there will surely be another grand occasion.</p>
<p>The Green Team Women's Basketball Team, with a gathering of veteran players and the guidance of Qian Xucang, is naturally a good combination of beautiful flowers and green leaves. No wonder they were able to easily defeat the Three Provinces team in their first battle. Their use of the cross-shaped when trying to throw is even more worthy of promotion. It is also the result of Qian Jun's efforts. The so-called cross-shaped throwing is when the defender stands at the bottom of the basket to intercept the ball and pass it to the two forwards, while the two forwards shuttle back and forth on the left and right. This kind of throwing is not only for the sake of pleasing the eye, but also fits the actual situation. Because the defender in women's basketball never has the opportunity to throw the basket, even the right to free throw is exercised by the forward. Then the skill of shooting is indeed not necessary to practice, just like an old student singing, why bother practicing Qingyi? The principle is like this. May all teams follow suit, which is enough to improve the defender's interception and the forward's basket-running skills. Kang Ai Women's Basketball Team (photographed by Kang Zuchun)</p>
