<h3>慈善團體的整理與合併</h3>
<p>慈劇善事業在上海，具有相當悠久的應史，具有相當廣大的規模。老幼殘濺，錄寡孤獨之得以延續生命者不知凡幾。而社會秩序之得以安奪，人類表現博愛互助之精神，尤在慈善寥業之盛奎與善中可以規知。</p>
<p>近年以來，因各地受戰亂之餘，益以物價高漲，一般生活艱難，雞民雞童之數量激增。換客之，訛是需嬰慈善事業之服務範圍，更爲廣泛。所以，上海的慈善事業爲敵應巨前環境，應有適當的革新，以期應付當煎的需要，充分發揮慈警的服務效能。</p>
<p>我們檢討耳前上海的慈善事業，唯一的缺點，就是不能統一。於是發生散淺，無組織，無計劃，各自爲政等等現象。同樣性質的慈美裹業，機構不一，設施各異。而慈善團體爲少數人把持，藉爲利藪者更爲腐敗。因爲機講分立，事業費用的支化不免浪費，進就是號少服務效能，就鉻增加捐款人負担。譬如雇啞學校，機定全市有十個，教藝學生一千名，均爲獨立擭構，教養設施各異，放續遂教不同，且徠校夠有獨立開支。如莖合併覺一二校，或合併警理酌設分校，則教養設施上旣可一致，用人可以減少，開支自亦節省，價節省的經費，叩可充實事業的基礎，據去服游的效能。介立時教養學生一千名，合併時可既致費一千名呱上，是極可能的事。</p>
<p>所以，我們主張上海的慈警奎，應從整理與合拼兩大原則入手，作一次瀲崁的革新。藝理的目的，是增加收入，多辦事業犢合併的口的，是化零節為整，增厚力量。而整理興合併同一的目的，就是航一推進慈善事業，提高飛務效率。</p>
<p>根擄王而的原則，我們希望本市社會福利局麓啦擭呃園，負起統一推進的責任，也就是計劍實施整觀與合併。同時，我們更希望社會上有嬰望有地位的慈苦家，素具駕義熱忱的琺耑眾，共間協力促成其事。各慈善團體，尤應臉解整理與合併的目的，無非更加發揮慈善的效能，更進完成慈養的目的，正與慈善團體本身目的相同，應即接受整理與合併。</p>
<p>其次，整理與合併，除組織與設施之外，最主要的是經費問題。本巿數百慈善團體未能充令達成目的，經費不足是共同的原因。所以，如何集中營募經費？如何較之各別　募更爲有效？均爲整理與合併以後的重要課題。第一，必須有計劉有組織的，實行總動員式的勤　。第二，除了消極性的救濟以外，更注意積極性的救濟，與政府關係方面及金融界企業界合作，舉辦工藝習勦等矩期訓練，對於雖待救濟而可以生產者使之從事和產工作。</p>
<p>慈善事業之統一推進，是改造社會基礎事業，躉助成社會安定的覺決條件，而慈善團體的整理與合併，尤為慈善事業統一推進的必要步聚。願關係部門從速計議及之。</p>
<h3>日首相朂勵國民　為爭取勝利舊鬬　田中武雄任內閣書記長官</h3>
<p>東京二十日中央社電　據京都電話稱：日小磯首相爲參拜伊勢神宮，特至京都，三十日晨接見龍者團，因就本大和一致精神哭破國難事，發表談話如次：余顧與國民諸君共圖至靈，完成大東亞戰擊，以安聖慮，此次參露皇太神宮鱸及皇陵神社，報吿拜受大命，祈禱必勝途徑，得觀園民諸君忠誠爲國之盜態，不勝惑激。余如聞國民話君於耳畔大聲急呼曰，余等切寶仰賴各位大人先生，茍不盡刀，共如寮國之前淦何，我日本今日遭敵之反攻，敵軍正迫臨門龍，但余相信吾等士氣愈益昻舊，億兆一心，大和一致，各盡其職，為求勝科作最大努力，以突彼韉關，相信如此始能獲得天佑神助。</p>

<h3>協力大東亞戰爭　緬甸堪為模為模範　明日適屆獨立一週年紀念</h3>
<p>東京三江十日中夾社電　仰光每日新聞三十日事電：八月一日為為緬甸國獨立一週年記念日，値此軍大時期，太平洋及歐洲大陸，正演最激烈之決戰，而緬匐方面伊姆法爾及階段。緬甸國民不僅協力在緬日軍，且担任解放印度，使革慶孤立化之量大任務。緬甸國獨立之時日甚短，政府尙未普及至各地，因戰焜延續，生活必需品缺乏，因之社會秩序遭遇惡劣影響，惟希求以全力產成獨立，維持治安，裨益於國民。刻下在緬日軍與民衆間之協力，成續至為可觀，因之日軍無後顧之憂，可舉全力對付敵軍。即就數萬人力及大量禾稻牛馬羊等物力之補給言之，對舊戰於印度之日軍，其貫獻可謂極大。回視窮困於伊姆法爾之英印軍曾談稱，於二十四小時內將阿拉坎山脈方面之第五師，全部由空路輸送爭伊姆法爾，而緬甸國民之對日協力，亦可與英印軍空中之輸送力相抗衡，且對英印軍空挺部隊陸落擾亂後方等事，梅甸國民及民衆則協助日軍使彼等久困鈴密林內，無法施展其破壞金圖。獨立僅及一年之飯甸園，在東亞簾國中乃爲作戰股猛烈之地，其國民誠意已超過其他諸國，此可維持緬甸獨立之表現，唯有此種力量，始能克服任何匯難。緬旬國家代表巴莫，曾對肥老謂，戰爭並不究全有碍於建設，在事實上，緬楓團民協方戰學寡建設，以血汗築成之道路，完成日軍之重要基地，間時造成紬甸交通經濟之大動脈，貢獻國家經濟文化，利益類偉，鋼甸國對接爭之協力，乃東亞民話協力之模範。</p>
<h3>日大本營發表　空軍重要戰果　襲枊州芷江桂林各地</h3>
<p>東京三十日中央社電　日大本營二十日下午甘時二十分戰表，中國方面日軍航空都隊，於二十七日夜對廣西省之柳州，及瀾南省之芷江，二十八日發對桂林各地，分別强襲，對集結於各飛倦堪之有力美空軍加以潰減之攻繫，日軍全臉安然返防，計該兩日之聯合戰果如次：　燬敵機大型機四十八架，小瀏機三十五架，機類不明者一架，擊燬大型機十五架，小型織二十架，合計百十九架。　飛機塲設施被炸毀起火者計十九處。</p>
<p>毁渝機四百八十架</p>
<p>日軍基地三十日中央社電日空軍協力　漢沿綫陸上作戰，進攻優點渝美空軍，更爲掌握戰域上空制空權，連日繼續奮戰。時則乘機奇襲進攻渝軍菰進基地，刻已收獲光輝戰果。二十七日夜，强襲廣西省柳州，及湖南省止江。二十八日夜强襲桂林各機塲，轟炸在此等前進基地集中之渝軍有力機羣，使蒙受潰減打擊，一舉炸毀渝機百十九架。七月一日以後，合計此次戰果，計繫毀渝機達四百八十架之多，因日軍技術純熟，戰略巧妙，乃得補償兵員數量上之劣勢，更能收獲如此偉大戰果。如二十七日，二十八日，兩夜之歡擊戰，日擭一架平均擊落渝機三架，乃至四架。二十七日夜臼機炸發之柳州濺塲，從來爲補訪桂林機場之接動場，由於最近日軍之進攻，逐次電縮渝軍前進基地，渝軍只得擴充强化該機場興挂林，芷江，同作航空作戰之鼎形基地。此次日軍先發制人，即使該機協饑於沒減，今西南大陸之渝軍慕地果，悉被日空軍予以粉碎。</p>
<p>日機進攻機塲情形</p>
<p>中綫日軍某基地三十日中央社電　日空靈精鏡，二十八日晚間大規進攻桂林，獷將其西南方機場停放之飛機全部炸與，使駐渝美空軍前盡基地臨於潰減。是役日　銳轟炸機隊突冒渝軍高射砲火，反僅俯衡轟炸，由低空作準確之投彈，渝軍以聯空　縱橫探照，日機　妙穿行，從容轟炸，一舉炸毀　機大小約五十架，更使渝機塲　處起火。其中一處為烯料庫，起火不久，作大爆炸，大光冲天。同時另一隊日機攻擊桂林南方機塲，炸毀渝陸上機十架。此外更有一隊日機進攻丹竹機塲，收獲莫大戰果，三隊均安返基地云</p>
<h3>茶陵南方　渝軍被圍</h3>
<p>湖南前緩基地三十白中央社電渝第四十四家第二十軍，及敗發部隊約十萬，為救援衡陽城內渝軍，會企國切斷臼軍水站綫，然放茶陵·安仁·醴陵。附近，爲日軍繫潰。自本月二十日以來，乃集結於茶陵附近，再作進擊衡陽之態勢，日軍則出以先發制人之攻擊，鈴茶陵南方，包園渝軍。二十四日晨，至二十七日止，歷四日間之戮鬥，予渝軍以潰減打擊，渝軍遁向萬洋山山系方面云。</p>
<h3>印度解放的黎明　上原虎重　崩潰中的英國統治</h3>
<p>印度將不為殖民地</p>
<p>即度解教問題，由擠火東觀獷爭，即由於日本帝關的援助印度，而已經成爲現實問題了，這一點是無客　言的，然而處在這一重大時期，鮑斯以最高負責者的資格，而担起解放祖國的重任，　實在也是得天之助。國權運動的主體，大家都知道，是國民會讀過，而國民會詻海的指道階麗，童於大前年一綱打盡，於是園織運動成爲家龍無首的現象。然而只有鮑斯號個人，事加噸流浪鈴撫洲，所以便成爲唯一的漏網之魚。因而大東號戰爭　發，他即由歡瀾飛赴東京，再出現於昭南島，而方能組織自自印度政府，以及指導解放和國的神聖事業。不僅如此，這位鮑斯，在人才經濟的印度指導層當中，是出類拔萃的優秀人物，而對於英國人蔞說，實在是一個最大的對頭。換言之，他深信解放祖國，必須藉助武力，自由獨立必須由刀劍來爭取。然而談到其他指導者，鵠在麩主張不一的。原因有兩孤，一捆她吠然的主張不一致，另一個是英翻人加油加醋而使之不一致。縱然都在高呼恢復主機，然而意見則有必須澈底取得完全的獨立，以及在英業國內單純取得加拿大和漢洲那樣究全自治國的地位就心滿意足，間時在二者中問，仍有許多意見。此外對於達到目的的手段，往往也因人而異。甘地之不抵抗主義，和尼赫魯之社會主義等，就是鱟顯著的例份。對給這一點，英國政府臉例拿來一紙空頭支票，經過劉價還價的繙果，最機也不過把英鬨劉印度的統治方式，改為自治形式。</p>
<p>但從印度人方面來說，有的認為當局者迷，傍攔老淸，有的豁爲避重就輕，是人之常情，都道樣彼英磯的花言巧語所迷惑，所以國權派的步調始終不能一政。</p>
<p>然而鮑斯計破英覬人的陰謀，而痳爲即度的獨立只有用戰爭來飛得。從英國當局方面夾說，鮑斯她決不能放任的一個死對頭。他本身也很淸楚，機會未到時，在印度內是任何事情也不能作的，於是化裝乞丐，瞞過英人的耳目，越過印度西北境介巴爾，而逃亡至歐洲。總之，鮑斯之逃脫，即英國政府的大失敗，對於印度來說，正當全國的指導階級完全喪失時，最有力而最適當的指導者，突然由國外　來，實等於大早之望雲雲。</p>
<p>現在鮑斯所指揮的獨立戰爭，向印度國境內推進了。罵尼布爾侯園即將被獨立軍所收復了。道豈不是勁天地活鬼神的大事麽？麻尼布爾如　於獨立軍手中，則實具有重大意義。即英劉人對印度的之西年統治，已需入總崩潰的第一步，同時印度亦將與重慶英美斷絕一切關係。這兩個事實在世界史上對，乎戮大事件，但從現在戰爭的觀點上看，是有不可潔貴的有形無形之影饗的。（完）（季譯目四月二十三日提刋每日）</p>
<h3>滿洲國境內　防空陣鞏固　必能澈底擊滅敵企圖</h3>
<p>新京二一十日中央社電　滿洲國政府當局關於此次敵機空襲鞍山大連事，於二十九日午後七時半特發表談話，以鼓勵國民增强防空陣營，以期發揮擊滅敵機之能力。其談話要旨如次：敵機終於來襲我國本土，但據軍方發轟，我損害極爲輕　，此皆由於我防空　璧之堅固，致使敵企劂通受挫折。敵今後勢將再度來襲，於斯望全體國民使防衛陣營更須加强，同時更常克守所職發揮總力，以期澈底擊滅敵機，實不勝期待。</p>
<p>新京三十日中央社電　敵機曾捷二十九日正午，以數架分隊侵入大連鞍山，其中餞入較山之敵機六架，曾轟炸該地附近，但該地被害極輕微，且該地民心並未因敵饑來襲而動搖。又來襲大連附近之敵機，亦曾投下炸彈若干枚，但補害啡當輕微。敵機於轟炸後，即向中國方衡逸去，當敵機來襲時，日防空戰鬥隊及制空隊即予以攻擊，在鞍山附近擊落其一架。</p>

<h3>周化人氏昨招待　文化敎育界　日內將往周浦就新職</h3>
<p>本市市敎育會常務理事周化人氏，最近榮膺上海特別市第一區行政督察專員，周氏特於昨日午後三時假華懋飯店八樓舉行茶會，招待本市文化界暨私立中小學校長，計到敎育會常務理事劉仰山，胡教復及文化界代表顏加保，周越然，柳雨生，關露，魯風，潘予且，陶尢德，丘石木，暨崇實中小學等校長共四百餘人</p>

<p>胡敦復詞</p>
<p>次由該會常務理事胡敦復致詞云：「周先生在敎育界極力爲同人謀福利，兄弟在敎育會實掛名而已，目前上海敎育界令人相當滿意，諸同人均在極困難之局面下，勉力維持，尙望諸先生本以往精神苦幹下去，將工作更加推進。」</p>
<p>周越然詞</p>

<h3>論國定敎科書漲價問題</h3>
<p>— 施醉</p>
<p>國定中小學敎科書，係歸中國聯合出版公司印行，其原料報紙，由低價配給，故定價尙廉，本學期大約因配給價提高，及印刷製釘費驟增，該公司遂墨敎育部，要求調整定價，近傳敎部已允照原價再加二倍發售，而聞聯合公司方面，尙嫌所加太少，致目下售價尙未決定，且已停止發貨云。</p>
<p>查敎科畫漲價，應饗所及雖關係重大，然因成本加重要求調整，似亦未可厚非，但這裏所要討論者，為該公司在上學期配給得來之低價報紙，豈已完全印製敎科書？而敎科書又是否在上學期全部售完？抑有存紙及敎科書而不呈報敎部稽核？待其價目調整，所存之書，一律可照新價發售，瞬間即凈賺二倍，此種方法殊不正當，况還以二倍嫌少乎。竊思該公司為各大書局組織而成，故凡屬書業多係該公司股東，向其批售書營業，實不應借配給而從中取利，因此筆者認為該公司於本期起，理應在學期以前，將上期剩餘之存紙，及書本，與本期配給之報紙數量，製造成本，及開支利潤等：然後一定合理價格，公諸報端，以釋羣疑，惟其如此，才是賢明措置。</p>
<p>總之，敎科書有關一國文化，非普通商品可比，所定售價，務要做到　來廉賣，責來貴賣，倘以廉來貴　，尤非配給之本意，否則，直接調查學校學生人數，採用配給制度，亦非難事，又為防止如上學期因備貨欠勻致引起黑巿不良現象，本期須請公司當局早作準備，免得再蹈覆轍，轉瞬學期即屆特陳如上，願中國聯合出版公司諸公垂鑒焉。（移酬助學）</p>

<h3>Organization and Merger of Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>Charitable endeavors in Shanghai have a long and substantial history, with a considerably broad scale. Countless elderly, young, disabled, widowed, orphaned, and lonely individuals have had their lives extended thanks to these efforts. Moreover, the maintenance of social order and the manifestation of humanity's spirit of universal love and mutual aid can particularly be observed in the flourishing and virtuous nature of charitable enterprises.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the aftermath of war in various regions, coupled with rising prices and general hardship, the number of impoverished citizens and children has surged. In other words, the service scope of charitable endeavors needs to be even more extensive. Therefore, Shanghai's charitable organizations should adapt to the current environment with appropriate reforms to meet the needs of the present day and fully realize the effectiveness of charitable services.</p>
<p>When we examine the current state of charitable endeavors in Shanghai, the only flaw is the lack of unification. This leads to phenomena such as dispersion, lack of organization, lack of planning, and each entity acting independently. Charitable activities of a similar nature are conducted by different organizations with varying facilities. Furthermore, charitable groups are often controlled by a few individuals who exploit them for personal gain, leading to corruption. Due to the separation of institutions, the expenses for these enterprises are inevitably wasted, which reduces service efficiency and increases the burden on donors. For example, if there are ten schools for the deaf and mute in the city, teaching a thousand students, all independently managed with different educational facilities and varying teaching methods, each school would have its own independent expenditures. If these were merged into one or two schools, or managed jointly with branch campuses, the educational facilities could be standardized, manpower could be reduced, and expenses would be saved. The saved funds could then be used to strengthen the foundation of the enterprise and enhance service efficiency. It is entirely possible that teaching and caring for a thousand students could cost less after a merger, perhaps even accommodating more than a thousand.</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that Shanghai's charitable undertakings should be reformed comprehensively, starting with the two major principles of organization and merger. The purpose of organization is to increase income and establish more enterprises, while the purpose of merger is to consolidate fragmented efforts to increase strength. The common goal of both organization and merger is to uniformly promote charitable endeavors and improve service efficiency.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, we hope that the city's Bureau of Social Welfare will take on the responsibility of unified promotion, that is, planning and implementing organization and merger. At the same time, we further hope that charitable individuals with prestige and status in society, and philanthropists with a long-standing dedication to righteous causes, will work together to make this happen. All charitable organizations, in particular, should understand that the purpose of organization and merger is nothing more than to further enhance the effectiveness of charity and better fulfill the purpose of charitable care, which is in line with the organizations' own goals, and should therefore accept organization and merger.</p>
<p>Secondly, in addition to organization and facilities, the most important issue in organization and merger is funding. The inability of hundreds of charitable organizations in the city to fully achieve their goals is due to a common reason: insufficient funding. Therefore, how to concentrate fundraising efforts? How to make fundraising more effective than individual efforts? These are important issues to be addressed after organization and merger. First, there must be planned and organized, all-out fundraising campaigns. Second, in addition to passive relief efforts, more attention should be paid to active relief efforts, cooperating with the government and the financial and business sectors to organize industrial arts training and other short-term training programs, enabling those who are in need of relief but can still be productive to engage in productive work.</p>
<p>The unified promotion of charitable endeavors is a foundational task for transforming society and a crucial prerequisite for achieving social stability. The organization and merger of charitable organizations is a necessary step for the unified promotion of charitable endeavors. We hope that the relevant departments will promptly discuss and plan for this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Urges Nationals to Fight for Victory. Takeo Tanaka Appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a telephone call from Kyoto, Prime Minister Koiso visited Kyoto to pay respects at the Ise Grand Shrine. He met with the delegation of the Dragon Society on the 30th, and spoke about overcoming national difficulties with the spirit of Great Harmony, as follows: I am committed to working with all of you to achieve the Great East Asian War, to ease the Emperor's concerns. This time, I visited the Ise Grand Shrine and the Imperial Mausoleum Shrine to report on receiving the mandate and to pray for a path to victory. I am deeply moved by seeing the loyalty of the people to the country. I seem to hear the people shouting in my ear, "We rely on you, esteemed gentlemen. If we do not do our best, what will become of our country? Japan is now facing counterattacks from the enemy, and enemy troops are approaching. But I believe that our morale is growing, and that hundreds of millions of people, united in great harmony, will each do their duty, making every effort to achieve victory, to break through the enemy's encirclement. I believe that only in this way can we receive divine favor and heavenly assistance."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - It has been decided that Takeo Tanaka, the Political Superintendent of the Government-General of Korea, will be appointed as the Chief Cabinet Secretary. Before Mr. Tanaka takes office, the Foreign Affairs duties will be temporarily handled by the Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, Miura, who arrived in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 29th. At the same time, the Japanese government issued the following imperial decree: Takeo Tanaka is appointed as Chief Cabinet Secretary, and Kazuo Miura, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, is relieved of his concurrent position as Chief Cabinet Secretary. Takeo Tanaka is from Mie Prefecture, 54 years old, graduated from Meiji University with a degree in law in the 45th year of Meiji (1912). He served as the Deputy Director of the Supervisory Department of the North China New People's Society, and was appointed as the Vice Minister of Colonial Affairs in April of the 14th year of Showa (1939). Later, he served as the Political Superintendent of the Government-General of Korea until now.</p>
<h3>Burma Can Serve as a Model for Cooperation in the Great East Asia War; Tomorrow Marks the First Anniversary of Independence</h3>
<p>Tokyo, March 30 (Central News Agency) - The Yangon Daily News reports on the 30th: August 1st marks the first anniversary of Burma's independence. At this time of great war, when the Pacific and the European continent are witnessing the most intense battles, the Burmese are actively participating in the Imphal and Kai stages. The Burmese people are not only cooperating with the Japanese army in Burma, but also undertaking the major task of liberating India and isolating the British and Indian forces. Burma's independence is short-lived, and the government has not yet been extended to all parts of the country. Due to the continuation of the war, there is a shortage of daily necessities, which has adversely affected social order. However, there is a desire to fully produce for independence, maintain public order, and benefit the people. The cooperation between the Japanese army and the people in Burma is remarkable, so the Japanese army has no worries about the rear and can devote all its efforts to deal with the enemy. In terms of the supply of tens of thousands of people, a large amount of rice, cattle, horses, sheep, and other materials, its contribution to the Japanese army fighting in India can be said to be extremely great. Looking back at the British and Indian troops trapped in Imphal, it has been said that the entire Fifth Division from the Arakan Mountains was transported by air to Imphal within 24 hours. The Burmese people's cooperation with Japan is comparable to the British and Indian air transport capacity, and the Burmese people and civilians are assisting the Japanese army in preventing British and Indian airborne troops from landing and disrupting the rear. The Burmese people and civilians are assisting the Japanese army, keeping them trapped in the dense forests and unable to carry out their sabotage plans. Burma, which has only been independent for a year, is the most fiercely contested country in East Asia, and its people's sincerity has exceeded that of other countries. This is the expression of maintaining Burma's independence, and only this kind of strength can overcome any difficulties. Burma's representative, Ba Maw, once said to Fei Lao that war does not completely hinder construction. In fact, the Burmese people are cooperating in the war and engaging in construction, building roads with blood and sweat, completing important bases for the Japanese army, creating a major artery for Burma's transportation and economy, and contributing to the country's economic and cultural interests. Burma's cooperation in the war is a model for East Asian peoples' cooperation.</p>
<h3>Imperial Headquarters Announces Significant Air Force Achievements; Attacks on Liuzhou, Zhijiang, Guilin, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters of Japan announced at 5:20 PM on the 20th that the Japanese Army Air Force in China carried out strong attacks on Liuzhou in Guangxi Province and Zhijiang in Hunan Province on the night of the 27th, and on Guilin on the 28th, inflicting devastating damage on the powerful US Air Force concentrated at various airfields. All Japanese aircraft returned safely. The combined results of the two days of combat are as follows: Destroyed 48 large enemy aircraft, 35 small aircraft, and 1 aircraft of unknown type; shot down 15 large aircraft and 20 small aircraft, totaling 119 aircraft. Nineteen airfield facilities were bombed, destroyed, and set on fire.</p>
<p>480 Aircraft Destroyed</p>
<p>Japanese Base, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force is cooperating in land operations along the Hankou railway line, attacking superior U.S. and Chinese Air Forces in order to seize control of the airspace over the battle zone, and continuing to fight bravely every day. Taking advantage of opportunities to launch surprise attacks on U.S. and Chinese advanced bases, they have already achieved brilliant results. On the night of the 27th, they launched a strong attack on Liuzhou in Guangxi Province and Zhijiang in Hunan Province. On the night of the 28th, they launched a strong attack on various airfields in Guilin, bombing and devastating the powerful formations of Chinese aircraft concentrated at these advanced bases, destroying 119 aircraft in one fell swoop. Since July 1st, the total number of Chinese aircraft destroyed as a result of this campaign amounts to as many as 480. Because the Japanese army is skilled and uses clever tactics, they are able to compensate for their numerical inferiority and achieve such great results. For example, in the night battles on the 27th and 28th, Japanese aircraft shot down an average of three to four Chinese aircraft per sortie. The Liuzhou airfield, which was bombed on the night of the 27th, has always been a connecting field for the Guilin airfield. Due to the recent Japanese attacks, the advanced bases of the Chinese army have been gradually reduced, and the Chinese army has had to expand and strengthen the airport with Guilin and Zhijiang, jointly making up a three-legged base for air operations. This Japanese pre-emptive strike has caused the airfield to be devastated, and the Chinese military's rear base on the southwest continent has been shattered by the Japanese Air Force.</p>
<p>Situation of Japanese Aircraft Attacking Airfields</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base on the Central Front, 30th (Central News Agency) - Japanese pilots and airmen, on the evening of the 28th, launched a large-scale attack on Guilin, bombing and destroying all the aircraft parked in the southwestern airfield, causing the advanced base of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing to be devastated. In this campaign, the sharp Japanese bomber squadron braved heavy Chinese anti-aircraft fire, conducting diving bombing runs and accurately dropping bombs from low altitude. The Chinese army used searchlights to explore the sky, but the Japanese aircraft deftly maneuvered and bombed at ease, destroying about 50 aircraft of all sizes in one fell swoop, and setting several places on fire at the Chinese airfield. One of them was a fuel depot, which caught fire and exploded shortly after, with a great light reaching the sky. At the same time, another squadron of Japanese aircraft attacked the southern airfield of Guilin, destroying ten Chinese land-based aircraft. In addition, another squadron of Japanese aircraft attacked the Danzhu airfield, achieving great results. All three squadrons returned safely to base, it is said.</p>
<h3>South of Chaling; Chinese Forces Besieged</h3>
<p>Forward Base in Hunan, 30th (Central News Agency) - The Chinese 44th Division, 20th Corps, and defeated troops, numbering about 100,000, in an attempt to rescue the Chinese forces inside Hengyang, attempted to cut off the Japanese army's water transport line, but were defeated by the Japanese army near Chaling, Anren, and Liling. Since the 20th of this month, they have gathered near Chaling again, preparing to attack Hengyang again. The Japanese army launched a pre-emptive attack, encircling the Chinese forces south of Chaling. From the morning of the 24th to the 27th, over the course of four days, a fierce battle ensued, inflicting devastating damage on the Chinese forces, who retreated toward the Wanyang Mountain range, it is said.</p>
<h3>Dawn of India's Liberation, Tiger-Chong Uehara; The Collapsing British Rule</h3>
<p>India Shall No Longer Be a Colony</p>
<p>The Indian issue has become a realistic problem due to the outbreak of the Great East Asian War and the assistance of Imperial Japan; there is no denying this. However, at this important time, Bose, as the highest responsible person, has taken on the heavy responsibility of liberating his motherland, which is indeed a heaven-sent opportunity. Everyone knows that the main body of the national rights movement is the National Congress Party, and the guiding class of the National Congress Party was wiped out two years ago, so the organized movement became a phenomenon of leaderlessness. However, only Bose survived, having wandered to Europe, so he became the only one to slip through the net. Therefore, after the outbreak of the Great East Asian War, he flew from Europe to Tokyo, then reappeared in Syonan-to (Singapore), and was able to organize the Free India Government and guide the sacred cause of liberating the country. Moreover, this Bose is an outstanding figure in India's leadership among talents and economy, and for the British, he is indeed their greatest opponent. In other words, he firmly believes that the liberation of his motherland must be achieved by force, and freedom and independence must be won by the sword. However, when it comes to other leaders, their opinions vary. There are two reasons for this: one is that their inherent views are inconsistent, and the other is that the British add fuel to the fire to make them inconsistent. Even though they are all calling for the restoration of sovereignty, their opinions differ: some must obtain complete independence, while others would be satisfied with simply obtaining the status of a completely autonomous country like Canada and Australia within the British Empire. In addition, there are still many opinions between the two. Furthermore, the means to achieve the goal often differ from person to person. Gandhi's non-resistance and Nehru's socialism are prominent examples. In response to this, the British government always comes up with a blank check, and after bargaining, the most they can do is change the British rule in India into a form of autonomy.</p>
<p>However, from the Indian perspective, some believe that those in authority are confused and stubborn, while others think that avoiding the important and dwelling on the trivial is human nature, and they are all deceived by the British's sweet talk, so the pace of the national rights faction has never been consistent.</p>
<p>However, Bose saw through the conspiracy of the British and believed that India's independence could only be achieved through war. From the British side, Bose is a deadly opponent that they must not let go of. He himself was very clear that nothing could be done inside India until the opportunity arrived, so he disguised himself as a beggar, deceived the British, crossed the Indian Northwest border, and escaped to Europe. In short, Bose's escape was a great failure for the British government. For India, when the entire national leadership class was completely lost, the most powerful and appropriate leader suddenly returned from abroad, which was equivalent to seeing clouds in a great drought.</p>
<p>Now the war of independence commanded by Bose has advanced into Indian territory. Manipur State is about to be recovered by the independence army. Isn't this a matter that moves heaven and earth and stirs ghosts and gods? If Manipur falls into the hands of the independence army, it will have great significance. That is, the British's two-hundred-year rule of India has entered the first step of total collapse, and at the same time, India will sever all ties with Chongqing, Britain, and the United States. These two facts are great events in world history and have immeasurable tangible and intangible influences from the current war's point of view.

<h3>Air Defense Array Consolidated Within Manchukuo; Certain to Completely Destroy Enemy Attempts</h3>
<p>Xinjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the enemy's air raid on Anshan and Dalian, the government of Manchukuo issued a statement at 7:30 PM on the 29th to encourage the people to strengthen the air defense array in order to exert the ability to destroy enemy aircraft. The main points of the statement are as follows: Enemy aircraft have finally attacked our country's mainland, but according to the military's announcement, our damage is extremely minor. This is all due to the solidity of our air defense, which has frustrated the enemy's attempts. The enemy will likely attack again in the future, so we hope that all people will further strengthen the defense array, and at the same time, always adhere to their duties and exert their full strength in order to completely destroy enemy aircraft. We sincerely expect this.</p>
<p>Xinjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - Enemy aircraft infiltrated Dalian and Anshan at noon on the 29th in several detachments. Six of the enemy aircraft infiltrated Anshan and bombed the vicinity, but the damage to the area was very minor, and the morale of the people in the area was not shaken by the enemy's attack. The enemy aircraft that attacked the vicinity of Dalian also dropped several bombs, but the damage was relatively minor. After the bombing, the enemy aircraft fled in the direction of China. When the enemy aircraft attacked, the Japanese air defense combat team and air control team attacked them, shooting down one near Anshan.</p>

<h3>Fluid Battle Unfolds in the Vistula River Basin; Main Force of German Army Retreats Towards Warsaw</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Domei News Agency: After the German army retreated from Galicia and the Soviet army broke through several outposts, the fluid battle in the area east of the Vistula River to the Bug River is extremely fierce, and the battle has obviously reached its climax. The Soviet army is advancing towards Warsaw, Deblin, and Jaroslaw, Przemysl on a broad front, and at the same time, is attacking southwest with a large force, the western part of Galicia and the Carpathian Mountain outposts. This form of offensive gives the German army an opportunity to counterattack. The German troops surrounded in the Harison area in the upper reaches of the Goster River have broken through to the west and arrived at Kalusz. A German tank force launched a counterattack from Przemysl to the upper reaches of the Dniester, occupying Sambor City, and at the same time, the threat to the garrison of Przemysl City was lifted. Part of the Soviet army in the lower reaches of the San River has crossed the river, but the German army is resisting strongly on the west bank. The German army, retreating from Boblingen, fought fiercely with the Soviet army in Shander, and the Soviet army only made a partial breakthrough at one point, hindering the German army's movements. The German army, retreating from Brest-Litovsk, fought a major battle with three Soviet divisions west of the city. The German army charged through the Soviet positions at the fastest speed, joining forces with the main German force, and then retreated towards Warsaw. In the central section of the Eastern Front, between Prebet and Tvena, the Soviet army is fiercely attacking the German army's shortened defense line. The battle in the Brest-Litovsk area is particularly fierce, but the German positions have not been broken. The Soviet armored forces in the Kaunas area concentrated in the Xirilai area, and attacked Kaunas and Neman from two directions.</p>
<h3>Turkish Ships Ordered to Cease Sailing in the Aegean Sea</h3>

<h3>German Troops in Southern Cotentin Adopt Evading Tactics</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) - Anatolian News Agency reports: A major defensive battle is taking place in the southern Cotentin Peninsula. The US troops, who penetrated west of Vire, continue to attack fiercely, making considerable progress with their strong forces. However, this progress is not enough to affect the overall situation of the Normandy campaign. The German commander transferred the main German force between Wednesday evening and Brière to escape the danger of being surrounded. The German army has set up a defense line in the area of Rocques, Surice, and Cirice with a small force, holding off the enemy's attack for more than 24 hours. After completing the mission, the German army also retreated to the south.</p>
<h3>Anti-Axis Headquarters Relocated to Italy</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Algiers: The Anti-Axis forces have relocated their Mediterranean Command from Algiers to Italy. It is rumored that the new headquarters will be located in Naples.</p>
<h3>German Head of State Congratulates Mussolini on his Birthday</h3>

<h3>Meteor Bomb Raids in Clusters on England, Rendering British Defenses Ineffective</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Stockholm, 30th. It appears that the German army has begun "mass attacks" of meteor bombs since the night of the 28th. According to a London dispatch, three tons of meteor bombs are formed into a group, flying in succession with a short distance between them. Due to last night's attack, the damage and casualties are even more significant. With the use of cluster tactics, the bombing of meteor bombs will inevitably become more intense in the future. A certain influential newspaper here commented on this matter, stating that the Germans seem to have further improved the launching device of the meteor bombs, launching fourteen or even ten meteor bombs at once. This new German tactic has completely invalidated the British army's concentrated defense tactics.</p>
<h3>Germany Promulgates Wartime General Mobilization Regulations; Rectifying Discipline is of Utmost Importance</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th. Since the Minister of Propaganda took office as the General Supervisor of Mobilization, his actions have been closely watched not only by the German people but also by the countries opposing the Axis powers. On the 28th, the first implementation regulations for the General Mobilization Act were announced, strictly prohibiting "holding positions without performing duties." Germany, as a country that strengthens the power of the party, often sees unscrupulous individuals using personal connections. Giving Goebbels full authority to cut through the chaos with decisive measures represents a final general mobilization. This measure is extremely thorough, estimated to conscript at least 500,000 personnel. The regulations stipulate a grace period from the date of promulgation until August 15th, during which all idle personnel must voluntarily report to the labor affairs office for registration. After August 15th, strict inspections will be conducted to eliminate those in various agencies and organizations who occupy a position without contributing anything of practical value and who hinder affairs. At this time when the entire nation is making every effort for the war, it is indeed urgent to seek rectification. However, eliminating deeply rooted problems in one day is not easy. It is necessary to have a capable person take charge in person to rectify discipline. Hitler, in view of the July 20th incident and the tense situation on the Eastern Front, decided that those who "hold positions without performing duties" will be subjected to the same severe punishment as the employer and the offender. Doctors who sign false medical certificates to evade labor service will also be severely punished. To widely seek the cooperation of the people, Goebbels has ordered that all letters and other correspondence related to wartime general mobilization be treated as a type of military mail, without postage, to fully complete the final general mobilization plan. The results are worth anticipating.</p>

<h3>Air Raid Sound Control; New Rules Established; Statements Released by Japanese Army and Navy Authorities</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities have already revised the Shanghai Municipal Air Raid Sound and Traffic Control Regulations twice to strengthen sound and traffic control on the land side. This time, considering that there is also a need to strengthen control over water traffic and other aspects of the Huangpu River, it was decided to make the same revisions. However, since the current Sound and Traffic Control Regulations were promulgated in November of the year before last, they have been revised several times, and the articles have already become somewhat cumbersome. Therefore, taking advantage of this revision of water traffic control, it was decided to reorganize all the articles and formulate new Air Raid Sound Control Regulations, which were announced and implemented on July 31st by the Army and Navy Air Defense Command Special Order No. 4. At the same time, the Army and Navy Air Defense Authorities released statements explaining the purpose of the new rules and expressing hope for the cooperation of the citizens. The content of the statements is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Air Raid Sound and Traffic Control Regulations have been revised several times since they were promulgated on November 15, 1931 [Gregorian Calendar equivalent of 1942]. The articles have already become somewhat cumbersome. Therefore, after careful consideration, new rules have been re-promulgated this time. The purpose of air raid sound and traffic control is to prevent the occurrence of noise, so as not to hinder the hearing of aircraft sounds. The following are the main points of the new items in this regulation:</p>
<p>New Rules Main Points</p>
<p>1.  Limit the speed of ships after a warning alarm is issued and prohibit the use of small miscellaneous ship engines in specific sections of the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>2.  Military, public, and specially permitted civilian vehicles and ships should display the prescribed signs separately. In addition, other civilian transportation tools, those who hold special passes, except in special circumstances, may also pass through during general air raid alarms, but should understand the importance of air defense and must not arbitrarily abuse them.</p>
<p>3.  After the alarm is issued, even military, public, and specially permitted civilian vehicles and ships are prohibited from passing through specific areas near military air defense positions (with signs hanging around them). However, if there is no other way to pass, they may be allowed to pass slowly.</p>
<p>4.  It is stipulated that during air raid alarms, the guiding agencies should do their best to prevent the occurrence of noise. All police, self-defense groups, and baojia [local administrative units] and other guiding agencies should be aware of the gravity of the current situation, cooperate with each other to promote the popularization and thorough implementation of these regulations. The general public should also quickly understand the purpose of these regulations, in order to achieve great results. This is what is hoped for.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhou Huarin Hosted a Reception Yesterday for the Cultural and Education Circles; Will Go to Zhoupu to Take on New Position Within Days</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Huarin, the Managing Director of the Municipal Education Association of this city, has recently been appointed as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District of Shanghai Special City. Mr. Zhou held a tea party at the Cathay Hotel on the 8th floor at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, hosting cultural circles and principals of private primary and secondary schools in this city.

<p>Mr. Zhou's Speech</p>
<p>First, Zhou Huarin gave a speech, stating, "During my service at the Education Association, I am truly grateful for the guidance given by the gentlemen in the cultural circles. Recently, I was appointed as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District and will soon go to Zhoupu to take office. However, Zhoupu and Shanghai are only five miles apart in terms of distance. In terms of transportation, it takes less than an hour by train. Moreover, Zhou Town is actually a part of Shanghai's suburbs. Therefore, after taking office, I will establish a branch of the Education Association in Zhoupu, and will continue to promote Shanghai's education work with the same spirit as before. The scope of work has been extended to the suburbs of Shanghai. I believe that the gentlemen in the education and cultural circles will surely continue to give me various kinds of guidance. Today, I would like to take this tea party as an opportunity to express my utmost gratitude to everyone."</p>
<p>Liu Yangshan's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Liu Yangshan, the Managing Director of the Association, gave a speech, stating, "I am very happy to participate in Mr. Zhou's invitation meeting today. Although Mr. Zhou will be transferred to Zhoupu to take on a new position, he is actually still working in Shanghai, which makes me even happier. Mr. Zhou has worked extremely hard in the cultural and education circles in the past. This time, he must use political power to effectively help the promotion of cultural and educational work in the areas under his control. Mr. Zhou has repeatedly expressed the hope that I will take on more of the Education Association's work after he leaves Shanghai. However, I am not very familiar with the situation of the Education Association. Gentlemen, if you have any special opinions, you can discuss them with me at any time."</p>
<p>Hu Dunfu's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Hu Dunfu, the Managing Director of the Association, said, "Mr. Zhou has been working hard to seek welfare for his colleagues in the education circle. I am merely a nominal member of the Education Association. The education circle in Shanghai is quite satisfactory at present. All colleagues are trying their best to maintain it under extremely difficult circumstances. I hope that all gentlemen will continue to work hard with the spirit of the past and further promote the work."</p>
<p>Zhou Yueran's Speech</p>
<p>Then, Zhou Yueran, a representative of the cultural circles, gave a speech, stating, "Mr. Zhou has achieved very good results in the cultural and education circles in the past. Now that he has been appointed as the Administrative Inspector Commissioner of the First District, he will surely be able to give full play to his talents and achieve even better results." Finally, Guan Lu, a representative of the cultural circles, and Lian Jianzhong, the principal of Hongdao Middle School, Fa Fuling, the principal of Ren Zhi Primary School, Shen Xinfu, the principal of Hunan Primary School, Tang Fangbo of Mingzhi Primary School, and Zhang Jingwen of Jingwen Primary School also gave speeches.

Tickets are uniformly 130 yuan. The Tiyu team has been dominant in the two battles in Shanghai, and their superb performance has given the people of Shanghai a superior evaluation. The team's tacit cooperation is especially commendable. Chang Ying, Guo Yongen, and Guo Yaosong are the three tiger generals who have won the most praise. Others such as Cui Wenzhong and Zhao Shoucheng are also considered agile. As for the giants of the Monaco allied forces, their strength is not trivial. Kaijie Milov, Funik, Saskin, and Botuo are all veterans of long-term battles. The team's use of tactics and the coordination are all superior. Each team's ball skills has its own merits. When they meet, it is impossible to predict who will win.</p>

<h3>On the Problem of the Price Increase of National Standard Textbooks</h3>
<p>— Shi Zui</p>
<p>National standard textbooks for primary and secondary schools are printed by the China United Publishing Company. The raw material, newspapers, are allocated at a low price, so the price is relatively low. This semester, due to the increase in the allocation price and the sharp increase in printing and binding costs, the company requested the Ministry of Education to adjust the price. Recently, it has been rumored that the Ministry of Education has agreed to sell them at twice the original price. However, the United Company still believes that the increase is too small, so the current selling price has not yet been determined, and the delivery of goods has been stopped.</p>
<p>Although the price increase of textbooks has a significant impact, it seems that it is not entirely unreasonable to request an adjustment due to the increase in costs. However, what needs to be discussed here is whether the low-priced newspapers allocated to the company last semester have been completely used to print textbooks? And whether the textbooks were all sold out last semester? Or are there papers and textbooks in stock that have not been reported to the Ministry of Education for verification? Waiting for the price to be adjusted, all the books in stock can be sold at the new price, instantly earning twice as much. This method is very improper, and yet they still think that twice is too little. I think that the company is organized by major bookstores, so most of the bookstores are shareholders of the company. It is not appropriate to profit from the allocation when wholesale books are sold to them. Therefore, I believe that the company should, starting from this period, before the semester, provide the remaining stock of paper and books from the previous semester, and the quantity of newspapers allocated this semester, the manufacturing costs, and the expenses and profits, etc.: Then determine a reasonable price and publish it in the newspapers to dispel public doubts. Only in this way can it be considered a wise measure.</p>
<p>In short, textbooks are related to a country's culture and cannot be compared to ordinary commodities. The set selling price must be such that they are cheap when they are bought cheaply and expensive when they are bought expensively. If they are sold expensively after being bought cheaply, it is not the original intention of the allocation. Otherwise, it is not difficult to directly investigate the number of students in the school and adopt an allocation system. Also, in order to prevent the black market and other bad phenomena caused by uneven stocking last semester, the company authorities must make preparations early this period to avoid repeating the same mistakes. The semester is approaching soon, so I submit the above for the consideration of the gentlemen of the China United Publishing Company. (Moved to help students)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special City First District Office Proclamation No. 330</h3>
<p>(Regarding the scheduled issuance of the 31st to 60th series of Comprehensive Goods Rationing Coupons)</p>
<p>Proclamation: It is hereby decided that from Wednesday, August 2nd, the Certificate Issuing Offices of this Office will issue the 31st to 60th series of Comprehensive Goods Rationing Coupons to the domestic residents and Indian expatriates within this District.

Rationing certificates will not be reissued if lost. Taxpayers who are unable to present the spring property tax receipts or have any doubts about the certificate issuance date may personally inquire at the Certificate Issuing Office in their respective district from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day. The office hours of the Certificate Issuing Offices in each district are from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. and from 1:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. every day. Closed on Saturdays, Sundays, and public holidays.
