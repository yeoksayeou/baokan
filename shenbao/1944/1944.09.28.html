<h3 id="c1">紀念孔誕 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>今天是孔子誕辰，全國各地對於這位先師，都有熱烈的紀念。紀念孔子誕辰，當然是表示尊敬先師，不過，僅僅表示尊敬先師而紀念，似乎不夠積極意義。在尊敬之外，更需要研究孔子的人格與學說，所以爲後世尊敬的地方，然後盡我們的智能去學習模倣，使孔子的人格與學說普遍深入人心，發生影響作用。這樣的紀念，才有價值。　　關於孔子學說的中心，數千年來，歷代有儒家聚訟解釋，但各有不同，始終未有共同的結論。不過孔子的學說，并不是沒有中心。依我們看來，孔子學說的中心，側重於[恕]字，恕字施之於政事，則日絜矩。如[所惡於上，毌以使下：所惡於下，毌以事上。][民之所好好之，民之所惡惡之。]恕字施之於待人接物，則曰[不忮不求]。恕字施之於財富分配，則曰[不患寡而患不均]。　　孔子是一個大政治家，他的政治哲學，是在[得民心]。他認爲欲求社會的安定，齊民的翕服，必須就[不患寡而患不均，不患貧而患不安]的兩點着手，而謀社會的[均]與[安]。孔子當時的社會，是[天下無道]，[邪說暴行有作]的社會，他非但不出世消極，且時常流露其激世奮鬥的志氣，如[葉公問孔子於子路，子路不對，子曰：女奚不曰：其爲人也，發憤忘食樂以忘憂，不知老之將至云爾！]這種奮鬥積極的精神，更值得起敬。而尤爲目前社會一般消極的等待主義者的當頭棒喝。　　孔子相魯七日而誅少正卯，三月而魯大治。這是證明政治上必須賞罰嚴明，才能使政治上軌道。至於孔子在齊魯谷夾之會，不爲武力所屈，以正義折衝於撙俎之間，卒使齊國返還魯國的失地，這是證明外交上不屈不撓，堅持正義，卒能獲得勝利。　　我們現在的政治與社會情形，正與孔子當時相似，所以，我們對於孔子政治哲學，更感需要研究取法。我們目前政治上的問題，主要的是民生安定與治安確立，所以，[不患寡而患不均，不患貧而患不安]這兩句話，正好針對目前的現狀，必先從[均]與[安]兩事入手，以謀民生改善與治安確立。　　孔子在政治上所昭示我們的規範，不勝枚舉，只要我們把握幾處要點，切切實實做去，已能獲得成效。所以，今天紀念孔子誕辰，特別要重視孔子學說中對於政治推進的法則。如果我們紀念孔子誕辰，徒在儀式上的點綴，而不研究與倣行孔子的人格與學說，那末，紀念是多餘的。總之，我們認爲現在的尊孔，是研究的尊孔，是科學的尊孔。而非偶象的尊孔，宗教的尊孔。尊其所當尊，尊其所應尊。</p>

<p>中央社訊　日本駐華海軍部隊，刻正呼應陸軍之攻略戰，於浙江省南部要沖溫州，啓開甌江之水路，完成該江河口至溫州一段作業。關於此點，日駐華派遣軍艦隊報道部，二十六日發表如下：駐華海軍部隊，九月上旬與陸軍部隊緊密協力進攻溫州方面，九月二十日完成啓開至溫州之甌江水路，並與當地陸軍獲得連絡。　　中央社訊　協助陸軍部隊溫州攻略作戰之日海軍部隊，於九月九日突然在甌江附近開始行動，至二十日完成甌江河口，以迄溫州間約二十五海里之清掃海面工作。按甌江水道口有溫州島（一名靈崑島），以分甌江爲南北兩水道，水路極形複雜，潮流殊激。日軍艦船逆流而上，遭逢非常困難。且溫洲爲淅省南部臨東海之要衝，故九月十日，正在甌江河口沙頭水道進行清除工作中之日方艦船，受B25型一架及P51型四架敵機編隊來襲。當時日海軍部隊奮起應戰，即予擊退，是以日海軍部隊非但實施水上工作，並須戒備敵第三戰區。十八日會發見敵殘部雲集於南岐山方面，亦立加擊潰。日軍對海陸空三方面對付敵人，始得成功開始甌江水道</p>

<p>中央社訊　據東海ＸＸ日艦三谷海軍報道班員，十九日發出電報，原文如下：溫州爲東海著名要衝，過去繼續其抗戰迷夢，但經日軍攻陷，現已潕見甦生，民衆樂於協力，戰後建設，進展甚速。該地區附近農民，以往在抗戰之名目下，其生活情況如何，言來實令人悲慘，蓋無日不在死亡綫上掙扎也。記者當ＸＸ艦靠港時，獲得敵方之農村調查資料，並從附近農民言語中，獲悉農村情況。茲將永嘉縣（舊名溫州）農村實情，作一詳細報告。</p>
<h3 id="c24">生產一斑 <a href="#c24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>永嘉縣縣政府設在溫州，該縣東南角，面臨東海，夾於大甌江中。其縣境四週爲瑞安·青田·縉雲·仙居·黃　·樂清·等六縣。一八七六年以芝衆條約，即於翌年開港，該縣農產物主要者爲米麥等，豆類產量亦豐，平均年產米一百八十萬擔，產麥二十萬擔，他如棉花橘子等亦有出產，於重要農產物中，亦占一席地位。記者所得調查資料，爲永嘉縣中之甌江下海南部地帶之沙村，溫州市南郊之葡萄棚，甌江流域之朱塗，以及霞碧，徐家灣，飛田，等六村之農村調查統計表。於此統計表中，可以窺見抗戰地區農民，瀕於死亡的苦悶神情</p>
<h3 id="c25">村戶調查 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>永嘉縣占來盛行地主制度，據上述六村的村戶分類，表示貧農及雇農計二百二十三戶，占總戶數百分之七十七弱，類似中農戶數計十八戶，僅占全數百分之六強。此外被視爲富農者三戶而已，占總戶數百分之一·四。地主四戶，佔百分之一·三八。全縣面積約一萬二千方里，山岳地帶占其泰半，利用耕地面積八十二萬三千畝，而全縣戶口計十五萬戶，六十七萬人，農民約佔百分之七十八。如平均分配之，每一農民可得耕地二畝，又上述六村戶數，計二九二戶，農民計一三一一人，如每一階層平均分配，其所有耕地，則地主階級所有出地二六一畝，每戶平均六十五畝強，每人五·五五畝。富晨階級所有田地一六○畝，平均每戶三十三·五三畝，每人五·二九畝。中農田地一五九畝半，平均每戶八·八六畝，每人一·三七畝。貧農及雇農有田地三九六畝二五，平均每戶一·七七畝，每人○·四一畝。但最近一二年情勢大變，由於軍閥及一部份指導階層，藉抗戰救國之美名，剝削搜括，農民愈窮，生活慘極，瀕於死亡。</p>
<h3 id="c26">農民歸來 <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>據農民談，過去兩度日軍進擊，該地中農以下貧農雇農，因無力避難，竟有以僅有之田地，以最賤價格出售者。又軍閥奸商多方榨取，致農民汗血所易之農產物，殆全部爲他人所搜取。農民不堪其擾，相率移居，或全家往附近小邑，沿途求乞或移居沿岸，賴漁業生活，亦有人緣林爲土匪者。此於數年前調查六村田地增減變遷表中，亦可明瞭，觀乎中農以下之窘狀，亦有慘不忍覩者。在如此慘況中過活之該區一帶農民，自日軍進駐，發出佈告後，悉眉殆展，避難農民陸續歸來，安居樂業，努力新建設工作。</p>

<h3 id="c31">美國國內的危機 <a href="#c31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>日美開戰，歷時已達二年有半，倚仗龐大物量的敵美國，戰爭的重壓，正在日漸加重中。尤其從本年初以來，敵方聲稱已進入對軸心國展開眞正的攻勢作戰期，在歐亞兩戰綫開始攻勢，數年來所蓄積的戰力，用於一旦，戰局在表面上似略見對敵方有利地展開着。可是另一方面，美國的國內戰綫，經數年來無理的壓下爲美國雜誌中所載的美國內戰綫的明暗面，從這裹也可見到，戰爭的旋風，已吹到美國國內，國民忍受一切痛苦，爲要在這狂瀾怒濤中生存而拚命掙扎着。　　美國在太平洋岸，往北到南，今已變成一大兵器廠。北爲沙特爾的波音飛機公司，南爲聖第果的康素立台德，萊恩兩飛機公司，這中間的飛機製造業者，如星棋羅佈般，不可勝計。但這些飛機公司現在也因人的資源不足而深感苦悶。大規模工廠中，勞動者不知不覺地漸趨減少了。　　美軍首腦部對此亦深感頭痛，召集各飛機公司的首腦赴華盛頓，討論增產並阻止工員的減少。去年上半期的六個月間，西海岸的飛機公司停工或解僱的新工人達十五萬四百三十五名。同期末，純增加人員約爲二萬人。去年九月，爲應軍部的要求，除原有飛機關係工員三十萬人外，另須堅急增加一萬三千七百名，至同年十一月，更須追加一萬三千八百十八名。</p>
<h3 id="c32">脆弱的女性 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>據八大飛機工廠的報告，新僱的數千工員中，八%在十五天內停工了，三分之一以上未繼續二個月，在三個月內脫離者約達半數一至一年後，一百個新雇工人中，僅剩十五人了。由此可見人的進出是怎樣的頻繁。因此，各公司用盡一切手段，設法防止工員的引退。　　於是廠方定下種種方法，如緩和勞動時間，支付高工資，使勞働者愉快地工作。自女熔接工的從褥以至喪事，由公司一手擔任的費用有八十八種之多，然而仍無補於人手的減少。　　尤以女子的出入爲更甚，這是因爲大多數女人因愛國心而去工作，但或許工作太重，於是想到家庭和結婚等事情了。當然，以上不過是一面，任何工廠中，　風沐雨站在本位工作的堅實的勞働者，不下幾千萬。他們認識他們的工作對國家是怎樣的重要，但以自己的快樂爲第一，比國家更爲重要者，這種人在美國也何止數萬人。</p>
<h3 id="c33">工人的要挾 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>各飛機公司給與工人們的服役，千差萬別，如洛桑塞爾的阿維農飛機公司，爲工作購買肉類蔬菜等，聖第果的萊恩飛機公司，除一切給與之外，甚至爲工人辦理銀行存款等瑣屑事。工廠內免費開映電影供工人及其家族娛樂。　　康素立台德，凡爾第及其他航空公司，爲工人與當局交涉關於違反交通事件，爲工人預約汽車，購戲院的對號劵，對工人廣播，免所得稅，爲工人領汽車並開車照會，使工人不必與官僚接觸，並不必大動筆墨。　　洛克希特及別的公司，備有許多乘汽車該問工人家庭的看護婦。缺席三天的工人必有人來家庭訪問，送香烟，糖菓，雜誌等，[請回到生產戰綫來罷！]對工員免息借款少廿五至百廿元。但就使這樣工人也不會滿足的，某工人等最近申請無償借款一萬元以購買戰時債劵。如不應即停工。北羅波公司連日在三個舞台演劇，洛克希特公司組織交響樂團，樂隊，跳舞會，合唱隊等，工廠甚至爲工人修理掛錶，掛鐘，無綫電，靴鞋，並替他們洗灌。　　許多工廠的簡店中，出賣可司匹靈，衣着，傢具，寶石，禮品，土產，以至於汽車另件。且比市價便宜一成。至於繳納水，電，瓦斯費，選舉的註冊等，誰也不必操心，都由公司代勞。　　更奇者，許多工人退出航空公司後，並不向軍需產業方面求職。這有一個根本的理由。政府雖然大事宣傳[悠久而困難的戰爭]，但許多勞働都以爲戰爭將近告終。他們視爲在戰爭結束的一瞬間，飛機和船舶關係的工廠，均將縮小，數萬人將因此失業。於是他們想脫離軍需工廠而在生存競爭中掙扎。這將來的生活問題，支配着一般民衆的頭腦，政府一切愛國的鼓舞，不被重視。（翔譯自九月二日每日新聞）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Commemorating Confucius's Birthday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today is Confucius's birthday, and throughout the country, there are enthusiastic commemorations for this great teacher. Commemorating Confucius's birthday is, of course, an expression of respect for the revered teacher. However, merely expressing respect through commemoration seems insufficient in its active significance. Beyond respect, it is even more necessary to study Confucius's personality and doctrines, understanding the reasons why he is revered by later generations. Then, we should use our intelligence to learn and emulate, so that Confucius's personality and doctrines can become deeply rooted in people's hearts and exert an influential effect. Only such commemoration has value. As for the core of Confucius's teachings, for thousands of years, successive generations of Confucians have debated and interpreted them, but each has differed, and a common conclusion has never been reached. However, Confucius's teachings are not without a center. In our view, the center of Confucius's teachings emphasizes the word "[forgiveness]". Applying forgiveness to government affairs is called "measuring with a carpenter's square." For example, "[What you dislike in your superiors, do not inflict on your subordinates; what you dislike in your subordinates, do not do to your superiors. ]" "[What the people like, like; what the people dislike, dislike. ]" Applying forgiveness to interpersonal relations is called "not being jealous or demanding." Applying forgiveness to wealth distribution is called "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality." Confucius was a great statesman, and his political philosophy was in "winning the people's hearts." He believed that if one wanted social stability and the willing submission of the people, one must start with the two points of "[not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about insecurity]" and seek social "[equality]" and "[security]". Confucius's society at the time was one where "[the world lacked principle]" and "[heterodox doctrines and tyrannical actions arose]". He not only did not withdraw from the world passively but also frequently revealed his ambition to arouse the world and struggle, such as "[When Ye Gong asked Zilu about Confucius, Zilu did not answer. Confucius said: Why didn't you say: 'He is a man who forgets to eat when he is angry, forgets his worries when he is happy, and does not realize that old age is coming!'"] This spirit of striving actively is even more worthy of respect and serves as a head-on blow to the general passive wait-and-see attitude of today's society. Confucius executed Shao Zhengmao after serving as prime minister in Lu for seven days, and Lu was greatly governed in three months. This proves that in politics, rewards and punishments must be clear and strict in order for politics to get on the right track. As for Confucius, at the meeting of Qi and Lu in Gu Jia, he was not intimidated by force, using justice to mediate between the goblets and platters, and ultimately caused the State of Qi to return the lost territory to the State of Lu. This proves that in diplomacy, perseverance and adherence to justice can ultimately lead to victory. Our current political and social situation is similar to that of Confucius's time, so we feel an even greater need to study and learn from Confucius's political philosophy. Our current political problems are mainly the stability of people's livelihoods and the establishment of public order. Therefore, the two sentences "[not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality, not worrying about poverty but worrying about insecurity]" are perfectly targeted at the current situation. We must first start with "[equality]" and "[security]" to seek improvement in people's livelihoods and the establishment of public order. The norms that Confucius revealed to us in politics are countless. As long as we grasp a few key points and do them diligently, we can achieve results. Therefore, today, in commemorating Confucius's birthday, we must especially value the principles in Confucius's teachings for advancing politics. If we commemorate Confucius's birthday merely as a formality and do not study and emulate Confucius's personality and doctrines, then commemoration is superfluous. In short, we believe that the current respect for Confucius is a respect for study, a scientific respect for Confucius, rather than an idol worship or a religious respect for Confucius. We respect what should be respected, and we respect what should be respected.</p>

Japanese attendees included Prime Minister Koiso; Army Minister Sugiyama; Chief of the General Staff Umezu; President of the Privy Council Suzuki; former Ambassador to the United States Kurusu; and many representatives of allied nations. During the luncheon, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu first elaborated on the close unity of the three countries and their march towards final victory. Then, Ambassador Stahmer and the Italian Ambassador Bringi Pigni affirmed their determination to jointly advance the war. The luncheon ended at 1:30 PM. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech are as follows: England and the United States, eager to end the war, are resisting stubbornly on the East Asian front with all their strength. They believe that they cannot achieve victory by military force alone, so they are employing great strategies. Recently, one or two small countries in Europe have become their sacrifices, which is regrettable. It is particularly noteworthy that as the decisive stage approaches, the enemy's ambition to dominate the world becomes increasingly apparent. Conquered countries will likely lose their national status. Their war aims are open conquest, open domination, and open exercise of police power. Judging from recent circumstances, the tragic situation of losing ideals and surrendering to the enemy can be clearly understood. We are engaged in a do-or-die war to realize the noble ideals of the alliance treaty, with the aim of realizing the liberation of Asia, protecting East Asia, and building a world of peace and human happiness. The significance of the Philippines' resolute participation in the war due to foreign invasion is even clearer. Our purpose is to enable each nation and each country to obtain what it deserves, realize international justice, and not exclude anyone. Furthermore, we will cooperate and fraternize to establish world peace. The war situation has entered a decisive phase, and the allied countries are facing a major test. We are gratified that our camp is becoming stronger. We especially admire the fighting spirit of the German, Italian, and allied nations. The Philippines' decisive declaration of war has added fresh strength to our camp. Our unwavering belief is that the just war will surely be victorious. On this anniversary, our mutual unity is even stronger. It is extremely meaningful to reiterate our determination to overcome any difficulties. Furthermore, at 3:20 PM, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu exchanged broadcasts with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Mussolini.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Laurel's Broadcast Inspires the Filipino People: Nationalistic Enthusiasm Boils Over <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Manila, 27th (Central News Agency) – Philippine President Laurel broadcast to the entire nation at 8:00 AM on the 26th, inspiring public morale. The main points are as follows: Our country declared war on the United States and Britain on the 23rd, but this was not initiated by us. We did not want war. During the establishment of the Philippine Republic last year, I would have declared a policy of good neighborliness, coexistence, and co-prosperity to the world. I have considerable experience of the tragic situation of war, so I sincerely hope for peace, so that my country can achieve its development goals in peace and friendship. However, the United States ignored this purpose and bombed Philippine territory, killing and injuring Philippine people and destroying their homes, completely shattering our hope for peace. Now that things have reached this point, I am determined to declare war on the United States and Britain for the sake of defending the freedom of the Philippine Islands and for self-defense. I hope that the citizens will recognize this situation with a calm mind, so as to preserve the glorious history of our nation. Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Hata and Shin, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese army and navy in the Philippines, who returned to Fukuoka from Manila, discussed the recent situation in the Philippines on the 26th as follows: The Philippine intellectuals I have contacted said that today's situation was expected, so there is no anxiety or wavering, and the public is very calm. They are determined to share the fate of Japan and defeat the British and Americans. At the same time, under the indiscriminate bombing of enemy planes, the indignation of the Philippine people has reached its peak, and the nationalistic enthusiasm of 18 million people has boiled over.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese air force in China has continuously bombed various U.S. air force bases in Chongqing from September 11th to 20th. During these ten days, it bombed Chenzhou four times, Xi'an three times, Ganzhou twice, and Guilin, Danzhu, and Ankang twice each. The results of each bombing totaled 16 U.S. planes shot down and 20 destroyed or burned, for a total of 37 planes. Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters report from Chongqing, the Chongqing military headquarters announced on the night of the 16th that the Japanese army had advanced about 21 kilometers south from Guanyang and is currently 80 kilometers east of Guilin. Another unit of the Japanese army's left wing is advancing southwest from Yongcheng, 120 kilometers northeast of Guilin. In addition, another unit of the Japanese army advancing from Guangdong to Guangxi has reached the north of Luoding County, near the provincial border, 150 kilometers southwest of Guangzhou. According to a United Press report, the Japanese army is advancing southwest from Yongming in an attempt to cut off the Hunan-Guangxi Railway south of Guilin. The Chongqing military authorities admitted that the Japanese army advanced 45 kilometers, and the Japanese army advancing west from the south of the West River in Guangdong Province advanced 48 kilometers and occupied Luoding County. The crisis in Guilin is becoming increasingly imminent. The Chongqing army in Hunan Province is currently doing its best to prevent the three-pronged attack of the Japanese army. The future changes are worthy of attention.</p>

<p>Front Line in Mainland China, 27th (Central News Agency) – A Japanese air force unit attacked the Liangshan airfield on the evening of the 25th, boldly bombing it after eliminating the interception of the Chongqing fighters, and all planes returned safely. The battle results are as follows: One medium-sized plane and one small-sized plane were burned, and three medium-sized planes were destroyed. In addition, the runway and seven ground facilities were destroyed. Beijing, 27th (Central News Agency) – On the 26th, the Japanese Air Force intercepted U.S. Air Force planes raiding Manchuria over North China, shooting down or destroying thirteen of them. Subsequent investigations revealed that during the aerial battle over Zhangde, a Japanese plane boldly rammed a U.S. plane. As a result, three planes were shot down and eight were defeated over Zhangde, for a total of fourteen planes in all locations. Furthermore, the ramming Japanese plane only suffered minor damage to its fuselage and was otherwise unharmed.</p>

<p>Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – When Japanese planes bombed Liuzhou, the U.S. Air Force counterattack base in Chongqing, in addition to dropping large bombs, they also dropped leaflets from the supreme commander of the Japanese army in South China, explaining the Great East Asian War aims of the Japanese army, stating: The Japanese army is now fiercely attacking Liuzhou, the U.S. Air Force base. If the U.S. Air Force retreats to the interior and continues to stir up trouble, the Japanese army will pursue them until they are destroyed. The Chongqing army that does not cooperate with the U.S. army will also not be regarded as an enemy.</p>

<p>Xinjing, 26th (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the Anshan area with seventy planes at 1:30 PM on the 26th for an hour and bombed the Dalian and Benxihu areas with more than ten planes. However, because the Japanese army's defenses were extremely strong, the enemy planes failed to achieve their ambition and fled after indiscriminate bombing nearby, so the various facilities in the Anshan area suffered almost no losses, while the port facilities in the Dalian area suffered slight losses. Later, at 4:00 PM, it was determined that two enemy planes were shot down and four were destroyed.</p>

<p>— Min Xian</p>
<p>This reporter's trip from Shanghai was originally limited to the area east of the Zhenjiang Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. However, when visiting a village in Gaozi Town, which belongs to Zhenjiang, it was already dusk, and there were no hotels in the town to stay in. Fortunately, a slow train from Shanghai to Nanjing passed by, so this reporter took it to Nanjing. After staying in Nanjing for two days, I have picked up a few small incidents to share with our readers.</p>
<h3 id="e13">No Professors in the University <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>This reporter went to Zhongda University to meet a medical student friend, who claimed that the department could not find professors, and the lectures were repeatedly postponed, or even hopeless, because most people with medical knowledge have already opened their own clinics. Who would be willing to become a poor professor with a maximum monthly salary of less than 10,000 yuan? The situation is different for the humanities departments, where most professors are also officials. However, most of them come for the extra salary. The situation in the highest institution is like this, which is truly regrettable. I wonder if the education authorities have any countermeasures?</p>
<h3 id="e14">Hope It Doesn't Turn Out Like This <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the authorities have emphasized the two major political tasks of agricultural production increase and rural construction. As a result, while this reporter was in Nanjing, agricultural production increase meetings and rural construction experimental zone and county government meetings from various provinces and cities were held in Nanjing. Restaurants and hotels added customers, and newspapers had many grand statements and great arguments, which was very promising and worthy of expectation. This reporter wanted to meet with friends, but they were either attending meetings or going to banquets or tea parties, so we always missed each other. It wasn't until the evening that I met a certain gentleman, who was a participant in the production increase meeting. I asked him about the meeting, and he said bluntly: "It's still the same old routine. I'm afraid the increase in production in the future will not even cover the cost of the meeting!" This may be an excessive remark made by someone after drinking, but considering the results of past meetings, hearing this cannot help but evoke endless emotions!</p>
<h3 id="e15">Strange News from the Civil Service Exam <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>There were more than fifty successful candidates in this year's temporary higher civil service examination, including three women, all of whom were university graduates and scored above average in the examination. Many male candidates were not as good. It is said that Jiang Kanghu, President of the Examination Yuan, considered it gratifying and repeatedly mentioned it in his instructional speech at the award ceremony a few days ago. It seems that President Jiang has always advocated women's rights, which is often praised by the people of Nanjing. After graduating from the ordinary administrative personnel training institute, these three female officials, who have come from the orthodox path, will first be employed by the Examination Yuan to promote this cause.</p>
<h3 id="e16">Rice Prices and Commodity Prices <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Recently, new rice has entered the market in Nanjing. Not only has the price of rice not fallen, but it has instead risen, which is caused by the traditional "[human scheme to make it bad]". Now that the authorities are paying close attention, the Nanjing office of the Rice Control Association is planning countermeasures to correct this. Although commodity prices in Nanjing are constantly rising, they are sometimes still reasonable. For example, the commodity prices for the second half of September assessed by the Nanjing Municipal Commodity Price Review Committee were set at 120 yuan per catty for cooking oil, 220 yuan per catty for cotton, and 65 yuan for a small box of Tiger Balm. It is still possible to buy goods at the limited price. However, table salt has not been distributed in Nanjing for five months, and the black market price has risen to 80 yuan per catty. Civil servants' rice rations have not yet been issued, and most are crying bitterly. In addition, disabled people cared for by the Nanjing Nursing Home are parading and petitioning due to lack of food, but the new-style singing restaurants in Confucius Temple are still full of people. Each has its own world, but the guests are either wealthy merchants or civil servants of a special nature.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Japanese Air Force Bravely Fights and Achieves Great Success on the Eastern Sea of the Philippines, Destroying Enemy Large Aircraft Carrier and Three Cruisers <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Philippine Base, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Philippine capital was bombed by enemy planes on the 21st and 22nd. The enemy used a large mobile fleet mainly composed of multiple aircraft carriers, equipped with battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, to approach the eastern sea of the Philippines, and carried out wave-like air raids with approximately 700 carrier-based aircraft (fighters, bombers, etc.). The Japanese Manila Air Defense Fighter Team broke into the enemy formation with a small number of aircraft on the 21st, shooting down more than 30 enemy aircraft. On the morning of the 22nd, the Japanese army challenged the enemy aircraft again and surrounded and attacked them, establishing an unprecedented achievement in the history of warfare. This reporter was at the base command post and was amazed and grateful upon hearing the commander's simple announcement of the battle results. It was unexpected that the Japanese army could achieve such remarkable results with only 15 fighter planes. Two large aircraft carriers (Washington-class, 44,000 tons) and one Class A cruiser were destroyed, and the aircraft carriers on two medium-sized aircraft carriers (25,000 tons) caught fire due to being hit by bullets. Only five Japanese planes did not return. A team leader angrily explained the situation of the fierce battle: "On the 21st, we successfully completed our mission in the battle with the enemy, shooting down 18 enemy carrier-based fighter-bombers. The mission of the Japanese army on the 23rd was to attack the intruding enemy mobile fleet. The only way to destroy the enemy mobile fleet is to secure air supremacy. In order to achieve this goal, we had to directly attack the enemy mother ships. The dive-bombing tactic is especially a means to destroy the enemy mobile fleet. Choosing excellent fighters, carrying bombs that must hit, we departed from the base at dawn and discovered the enemy mobile fleet in the dense clouds. About 7 or 8 to 12 or 13 destroyers and cruisers were clustered together, and all the battleships were also discovered, including the formal large aircraft carriers of the Iowa, Washington, and Saratoga classes. Therefore, the full picture of the enemy mobile fleet is now completely clear. We first targeted the large aircraft carrier in the center of the circular formation, bombarded the flight deck, and then turned the aircraft around to prepare for the second attack. This time, we flew near the mast of the battleship. At that time, three large cannons came into view, but this was not our target, because our target was the aircraft carrier. Suddenly, we saw a fire blazing on the deck, because the enemy ship's deck had been attacked by our artillery fire. At this time, the enemy fighter group was patrolling in the sky. Before long, the circular formation of the enemy mobile fleet was broken up by us. After completing our mission, our planes returned to the base. After dusk, friendly planes began to return one after another, chatting casually about their triumphant battle results. Some had attacked the enemy mobile fleet repeatedly seven or eight times before finally achieving their purpose. Others bravely fought in the sky over the enemy fleet for forty minutes and clearly understood the enemy's situation. Another young comrade said, 'I will strafe the enemy destroyers lined up and strafe them at low altitude one by one. At the same time, I will also strafe the fighter planes that are about to take off on the flight deck of the enemy's medium-sized aircraft carrier. I have also personally witnessed the embarrassing situation of the enemy navy.'"</p>

<p>Contact Established with Local Army</p>
<p>Central News Agency - The Japanese naval forces stationed in China are currently responding to the army's offensive operations in Wenzhou, a strategic point in southern Zhejiang Province, by opening up the Ou River waterway, completing the operation from the river mouth to Wenzhou. Regarding this, the Press Department of the Japanese Expeditionary Fleet in China issued the following statement on the 26th: The naval forces stationed in China, in close cooperation with the army, launched an attack on the Wenzhou area in early September, completing the opening of the Ou River waterway to Wenzhou on September 20th, and establishing contact with the local army. Central News Agency - The Japanese naval forces, assisting the army's Wenzhou offensive operation, suddenly began operations near the Ou River on September 9th, and completed the clearing of approximately 25 nautical miles of sea surface from the Ou River estuary to Wenzhou by the 20th. It is reported that the mouth of the Ou River waterway has Wenzhou Island (also known as Lingkun Island), which divides the Ou River into north and south waterways, making the waterway extremely complex and the currents very strong. Japanese warships encountered great difficulties sailing against the current. Furthermore, Wenzhou is a strategic point in southern Zhejiang Province facing the East China Sea. Therefore, on September 10th, Japanese ships conducting clearing operations in the Shatou waterway at the mouth of the Ou River were attacked by a squadron of one B25 and four P51 enemy aircraft. At that time, the Japanese naval forces fought back bravely and repelled them. Therefore, the Japanese naval forces not only had to carry out maritime operations but also had to be prepared for the enemy's Third War Zone. On the 18th, enemy remnants were discovered gathering in the Nanqi Mountain area, and they were immediately defeated. The Japanese army had to deal with the enemy on the sea, land, and air before successfully starting the Ou River waterway.</p>

<p>Central News Agency - According to a telegram sent on the 19th by a naval reporter named Mitani from the East China Sea XX Day Ship: Wenzhou is a famous strategic point in the East China Sea, which continued its anti-Japanese war dreams in the past, but after the Japanese army captured it, it has now been reborn. The people are happy to cooperate, and post-war construction is progressing rapidly. The living conditions of farmers in the surrounding area under the name of resistance against Japan were truly tragic, as they struggled on the brink of death every day. When the reporter's XX ship docked, he obtained enemy rural survey data and learned about the rural situation from the words of nearby farmers. Now, a detailed report on the actual situation of Yongjia County (formerly Wenzhou) rural areas will be given.</p>

<p>The Yongjia County government is located in Wenzhou. The southeast corner of the county faces the East China Sea and is sandwiched in the middle of the Daou River. The county is surrounded by six counties: Ruian, Qingtian, Jinyun, Xianju, Huang, Yueqing, and others. The county opened as a port in 1877, based on the Zhizhi Convention of 1876. The main agricultural products of the county are rice and wheat, with abundant soybean production. The average annual rice production is 1.8 million dan, and wheat production is 200,000 dan. Other products such as cotton and oranges also have production and occupy a place in important agricultural products. The survey data obtained by the reporter are rural survey statistics for six villages in Yongjia County: Shacun in the southern coastal area of the Ou River estuary, Putaopeng in the southern suburbs of Wenzhou City, Zhutu in the Ou River basin, and Xiatian, Xujiawan, and Feitian. From this statistical table, we can see the farmers in the war-torn areas, who are on the brink of death, with their distressed expressions.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Village Household Survey <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The landlord system has been prevalent in Yongjia County for a long time. According to the household classification of the above six villages, there are 223 poor and tenant farmer households, accounting for nearly 77% of the total number of households. There are 18 households similar to middle farmers, accounting for only 6% of the total. In addition, there are only three households considered to be rich farmers, accounting for 1.4% of the total number of households. There are four landlord households, accounting for 1.38%. The total area of the county is approximately 12,000 square miles, with mountains accounting for the majority. The cultivated area is 823,000 mu, and the total population of the county is 150,000 households and 670,000 people, with farmers accounting for approximately 78%. If evenly distributed, each farmer can obtain 2 mu of cultivated land. In addition, the above six villages have a total of 292 households and 1,311 farmers. If evenly distributed among each class, the land owned by the landlord class is 261 mu, with an average of 65 mu per household and 5.55 mu per person. The land owned by the rich peasant class is 160 mu, with an average of 33.53 mu per household and 5.29 mu per person. The middle farmers have 159.5 mu of land, with an average of 8.86 mu per household and 1.37 mu per person. The poor and tenant farmers have 396.25 mu of land, with an average of 1.77 mu per household and 0.41 mu per person. However, the situation has changed drastically in the last year or two. Due to the exploitation and plundering by warlords and some leading classes under the guise of resistance against Japan and saving the country, the farmers have become poorer, their lives are extremely miserable, and they are on the verge of death.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Farmers Return <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>According to farmers, during the two previous Japanese military attacks, poor farmers and tenant farmers below the middle class in the area had no means to escape and sold their only land at the lowest prices. In addition, warlords and unscrupulous merchants extracted in various ways, causing the agricultural products exchanged by the farmers' sweat and blood to be taken away by others. The farmers could not bear the harassment and moved away one after another, either with their families to nearby small towns, begging along the way, or moving to the coast, relying on fishing for a living, or some even became bandits in the forests. This can also be clearly seen in the table of changes in land area in the six villages surveyed a few years ago. The plight of those below the middle class is too terrible to witness. The farmers in the area who lived in such a miserable situation have been smiling since the Japanese army entered the area and issued announcements. The farmers who had fled have returned one after another, living and working in peace and striving for new construction work.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Crisis in the United States <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Two and a half years have passed since the start of the war between Japan and the United States. Relying on its massive material resources, the enemy United States is feeling the increasing weight of the war. Especially since the beginning of this year, the enemy has claimed to have entered a period of genuine offensive operations against the Axis powers, launching offensives on both the European and Asian fronts. The combat power accumulated over the years has been used all at once, and the war situation on the surface seems to be developing slightly favorably for the enemy. However, on the other hand, the domestic front in the United States has been unreasonably suppressed for several years, as seen in the bright and dark sides of the American domestic war front reported in American magazines. From this, it can also be seen that the whirlwind of war has blown into the United States, and the people are enduring all kinds of hardships, desperately struggling to survive in this raging storm. The Pacific coast of the United States, from north to south, has now become a large weapons factory. In the north is the Boeing Aircraft Company in Seattle, and in the south are the Consolidated and Ryan aircraft companies in San Diego. The aircraft manufacturers in between are as numerous as stars in the sky. However, these aircraft companies are now deeply troubled by the lack of human resources. In large-scale factories, the number of workers is unconsciously decreasing. The US military headquarters is also deeply troubled by this and has summoned the heads of various aircraft companies to Washington to discuss increasing production and preventing the decrease in workers. In the first six months of last year, 150,435 new workers were laid off or dismissed from aircraft companies on the West Coast. At the end of the same period, the net increase in personnel was approximately 20,000. In September of last year, in response to the military's request, in addition to the existing 300,000 aircraft-related workers, an additional 13,700 urgently needed to be added. By November of the same year, an additional 13,818 were needed.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Fragile Women <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>According to the reports of eight major aircraft factories, 8% of the newly hired thousands of workers quit within 15 days, more than one-third did not continue for two months, and about half left within three months. After one to one year, only 15 out of 100 newly hired workers remained. From this, it can be seen how frequent the turnover of personnel is. Therefore, various companies are doing everything possible to prevent the withdrawal of workers. Therefore, the factories have set various methods, such as easing working hours, paying high wages, and making the workers work happily. From the mattresses of female welders to funerals, the company bears 88 kinds of expenses. However, it still does not make up for the reduction in manpower. In particular, the turnover of women is even more severe. This is because most women go to work out of patriotism, but perhaps the work is too heavy, and they think about family and marriage. Of course, the above is just one side. In any factory, there are no less than tens of millions of solid workers who stand in their positions through wind and rain. They recognize how important their work is to the country, but there are also tens of thousands of people in the United States who put their own happiness first, more important than the country.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Workers' Extortion <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The benefits given to workers by various aircraft companies vary greatly. For example, the Avignon Aircraft Company in Los Angeles purchases meat and vegetables for work. The Ryan Aircraft Company in San Diego, in addition to all the benefits, even handles trivial matters such as bank deposits for workers. Free movies are shown in the factory for the entertainment of workers and their families. Consolidated, Vultee, and other airlines handle violations of traffic incidents for workers in negotiations with the authorities, make reservations for cars for workers, purchase theater tickets, broadcast to workers, exempt income tax, and obtain car licenses and driving permits for workers, so that workers do not have to deal with bureaucrats and do not have to write much. Lockheed and other companies have many nurses who visit workers' families by car. Workers who are absent for three days will have someone visit their homes, sending cigarettes, candy, magazines, etc., [Please return to the production front!] Workers are given interest-free loans of 25 to 120 yuan. But even so, the workers are not satisfied. Some workers recently applied for an unconditional loan of 10,000 yuan to purchase wartime bonds. If they do not comply, they will stop working. The Northrup Company presents dramas on three stages every day. Lockheed Company organizes symphony orchestras, bands, dance parties, choirs, etc. The factory even repairs workers' watches, clocks, radios, and shoes, and washes and irrigates them. In the convenience stores of many factories, they sell aspirin, clothing, furniture, jewelry, gifts, local products, and even auto parts. And it is 10% cheaper than the market price. As for paying water, electricity, and gas bills, and registering for elections, no one needs to worry about it, and the company takes care of it all. Even more strangely, many workers do not seek employment in the military industry after leaving the airline companies. There is a fundamental reason for this. Although the government has greatly publicized [a long and difficult war], many workers believe that the war is coming to an end. They believe that at the moment the war ends, the factories related to airplanes and ships will be reduced in size, and tens of thousands of people will lose their jobs as a result. So they want to leave the munitions factories and struggle in the competition for survival. This problem of future life dominates the minds of the general public, and all the government's patriotic encouragement is not valued.

<h3 id="e48">Strict Inspection of Banks and Money Houses that Extensively Provide Loans <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Recently, due to the settlement of accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival, the city's credit market has become quite tight. The Central Reserve Bank, in order to stabilize the financial situation, has provided funds and is doing its best to handle interbank lending. Therefore, financial institutions during the Mid-Autumn Festival should be able to safely weather the period. It is understood that the recent trend of tightening credit in the city has no relationship with the overall financial stability. Banks and money houses with the longest history and most established track records have extremely abundant funds and are not subjected to pressure due to the festive period. However, general emerging banks and money houses, due to their weak capital amounts and deposit businesses, find it difficult to cope with the urgent need for funds at this time. Moreover, some financial institutions excessively extend loans, and the loans issued are not easily recovered at any time, so they have no choice but to turn to interbank borrowing. Those that can borrow and circulate funds can maintain payments, while those that cannot easily borrow become stranded. Such banks and money houses have mismanaged their own business operations. It is reported that the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is paying close attention to such banks and money houses and has decided to send personnel to strictly inspect and correct them at any time.</p>

There are several points to be explained regarding the numbers in each table: ○ The number of registered people does not include students who applied to the school but were not recommended by the school, or who were recommended by the school but were not given an application form by the office due to the excessive number of people, or who filled out an application form but were not registered by the office because the office considered them to be unqualified. If these several restrictions were not added, the number of applicants would probably be more than twice the number of registered people. ○ The approved list was published in five installments. The number of people here has already removed the number of cancellations announced on August 26 and September 9. ○ The approval criteria are broader for elementary school students and stricter for middle school students and above. However, within the same level of school, the criteria are stricter for first-year students and broader for upper-grade students. The difference in percentages is due to this. ○ The approved amount, except for special scholarships and awards listed separately, is a maximum of 2,000 yuan per elementary school student, a maximum of 3,000 yuan for junior high school, a maximum of 4,000 yuan for senior high school, and a maximum of 6,000 yuan for university students, averaging about 70% of the tuition fees of each school. For those with lower tuition fees, the scholarship is limited to the full amount of tuition fees. For those whose tuition fees exceed the scholarship limit, the excess amount needs to be covered by the student's parents or by applying to the school for reduction or exemption. There is only one person who declared that they would give up the scholarship because the remaining amount could not be arranged. In addition, there are very few approved students who have not yet received the scholarship. It remains to be investigated whether they have dropped out of school because the remaining amount could not be raised. ○ The number of students under the special scholarship item is not included in the ordinary scholarship table, but the three types of awards are added to the ordinary scholarship, and the students have already received the ordinary scholarship, so they are listed in both places at the same time. ○ The committee of the Yuanju Pavilion Scholarship decided that the principal will not be touched in the future, and only the interest will be used, so all one million yuan and zero will be allocated to the scholarship committee for safekeeping and use. However, all procedures such as the distribution of awards will still be entrusted to this newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Thunderstorm (7) <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The daytime surprise attack picture was painted for five hours. The moonlit night surprise attack picture was painted for six hours. Like in a dream, Longfu finished the two pictures. It was completed earlier than scheduled. The first picture shows the tracks of the torpedoes and the enemy ship at the moment of explosion. The special submarine itself is not depicted. The second picture shows the special submarine approaching the shortest distance in a semi-submerged state. An officer boldly sticks half of his body out and uses binoculars to watch the torpedoes he launched, hitting the rear half of the Allison type ship, and causing a high column of water to erupt. The meaning of Longfu's painting this picture is that this young officer, that is, the Japanese submarine that has endured for forty years, has obtained the initial result of the torpedo hitting the enemy ship. Although the mission is reportage painting, the content is historical painting. However, the material itself is very dissatisfied due to time constraints and the constraints of black and white photographic versions, so he made an internal decision to plan a large-scale oil painting. He handed over the two pictures to the photography class of the Black Tide Society at 3:05 PM on March 6th. From 3:00 PM, Section Chief H always seemed to have a surprising announcement, and announced the manuscript at the press conference. Longfu avoided the crowd and stood in the corridor. At 2:00 PM, the great achievements of the Special Attack Force had been announced by the Headquarters, and after 3:00 PM, it was announced by the Ministry of the Navy. When the hour hand pointed to the number three, Colonel Nichi's fat body appeared in the press room, like a machine, together with Lieutenant Colonel Hidetada who was wearing a staff badge. Like leaves swaying in the wind, he was swinging back and forth. [March 6, 1942, 3:00 PM, Ministry of the Navy announced...] Colonel H's heavy and sharp voice spread beyond the corridor. He read aloud the entire letter of appreciation given to the Special Attack Force by the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. (It is truly worthy of appreciation! Such a magnificent and unparalleled martial movement...) Longfu affirmed this in his heart. Before long, Colonel H changed his tone again and read the following article: [...For those who died in battle among the members of the Special Attack Force, they will be specially promoted by two ranks on December 8, 1941.] (Ah, promoted by two ranks?) Along with Longfu's surprise, the sighs of the reporters also quietly came over. This was the first time that two ranks had been skipped since the promotion system was revised. Longfu was very happy and agreed with this. [Yuasa Hisashi appointed Naval Lieutenant Colonel... Tani Makoto appointed Naval Major...] This was really a bolt from the blue. Longfu was dumbfounded and didn't know what to say. He doubted that his ears had misheard. (145)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Overview of the First Anniversary of the Shandong Compatriot Association <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Brief History and Architecture Shanghai is a hub of international commerce and industry. There are many people from Shandong Province who come here to do business. In order to seek the welfare of fellow villagers and connect with hometown friendship, there was a proposal to establish a Shandong Guild Hall. At that time, Lu Gonghai, a former wise man from Shandong Province, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Commercial Treaties, happened to be waiting for instructions in Shanghai due to his mission to Germany. He and Wang Gong Yaoting, the magistrate of Shanghai County, did their best to preside over the matter, convened Shandong merchants and gentry in Shanghai, raised funds to purchase land, and hired workers to build the hall. The Shandong Guild Hall on Ximen Road in this city was completed in the thirty-second year of Guangxu. After entering the main gate of the hall, the Zhuangpu (estate) is secluded and tranquil, with winding railings and stone lions facing each other, creating a solemn atmosphere. The subsequent buildings are divided into three sections. The front is the Martial Saint Hall, the back is the Tianhou (Heavenly Empress) Palace, and the middle is the Zhidao (Supreme Way) Hall, which is the main hall of the association, divided into five rooms. Above it is the Dacheng (Great Achievement) Pavilion, which is dozens of feet high, where Confucius and the spiritual positions of the Four Associates and other sages are enshrined.</p>
<p>Organization and Members The association has been established for more than forty years since its founding. Thanks to the efforts of successive directors and members, the association's affairs have gradually developed. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Jinlu Primary and Secondary School was established, and the Qilu Villas were built, and the organization became more sound. Last spring, the former president resigned due to illness. Cui Jingzhi and Wu Jun were publicly elected by fellow villagers as the president and vice president, respectively, and the association's affairs became increasingly prosperous. Fellow villagers felt that the name of the guild hall was out of date, so last autumn, it was publicly decided to rename the original organization as the [Shandong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association]. New regulations were drafted, Cui Jingsan was publicly elected as the chairman, Wu Zuojun and Zi Yuting were elected as the vice chairmen, Wang Zifeng was elected as the chairman of the supervisory board, and Xu Dongyin Bingnan was elected as the vice chairman of the supervisory board. Su Chengde, Zhang Jinhu, Tan Tiankai, and Wang Xingqi were invited to be honorary chairmen of the board of directors. The entire supervisory board consists of 78 people including Liu Shaokui and Yin Leren. In order to achieve division of labor and cooperation, the association has established five committees under the board of directors: [Welfare], [Education], [Economy], [Membership], and [Entertainment], and two committees under the supervisory board: [Discipline] and [Mediation], responsible for promoting the association's affairs. The first batch of individual members has reached as many as 5,000 people, and the solicitation of the second batch of supplementary members and group members is about to begin, and even more people will join enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Honoring the Saints and Service Since its establishment, the association has taken the promotion of culture and the dissemination of Confucianism as its highest goal. Under the advocacy of honorary chairmen Su and Tan, Peking Opera charity performances and football charity matches were held, and the proceeds were used to promote Confucianism and repair the Dacheng Pavilion. The Dacheng Pavilion project has now been partially completed, and fundraising for the front and rear repair projects is still in progress. It is now planned to move the Martial Saint Hall and the Tianhou Palace to Qilu Villa, while the guild hall on Ximen Road will be dedicated to handling association affairs and promoting Confucianism. It is also planned to formulate regulations to allow fellow villagers from Shandong Province and people from all walks of life to borrow the auditorium and assembly hall. In order to promote culture and disseminate Confucianism, the association, in addition to using Qilu Primary and Secondary School as a foundation to provide scholarships and relief to out-of-school children, also holds ancient and modern cultural relics charity exhibitions and Confucian lectures. Each week, celebrities from all walks of life are invited to give public lectures, presided over by honorary chairman Tan. It is now in its eighth session, and there are many listeners. For the welfare of fellow villagers, the association is implementing services such as sending coffins, providing charitable land, repatriation, relief, death benefits, and employment assistance. It is also planned to establish hospitals, orphanages, and vocational schools, but this is a major undertaking, and it is hoped that enthusiastic gentlemen will work together to make it a success.</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of the association's establishment, and it also coincides with the birthday of Confucius. It has been ordered to hold a Confucian sacrificial ceremony at 2 PM in the Zhidao Hall of the association. At that time, Cui Jingsan, Tan Tiankai and others will preside over the ceremony. All members and teachers and students of Qilu Middle School will also participate as one. The ceremony will adopt classical elements and will be very grand. After the Confucian sacrifice, a first anniversary commemoration meeting will be held to report on the progress of the association's affairs in the past year, and there will be Peking Opera rehearsals and other entertainment from the entertainment group.</p>
