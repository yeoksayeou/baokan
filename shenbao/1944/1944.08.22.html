<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本最高戰爭指導會議</h3>
<p>問：小磯內閣成立以來，積極強化決戰</p>
<p>勝利態勢，近復設置最高戰爭指導會議，請</p>
<p>問其意義何在？</p>
<p>答：關於日本最近設置「最高戰爭指導</p>
<p>會議」的內容，就已公布的消息觀察，無疑</p>
<p>是決戰新階段的重耍舉措，對於今後國運及</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭有極大關係。小磯首相在親任式</p>
<p>吿終後第一次發表的談話中，就已提到日木</p>
<p>現正處於激烈的戰鬥中，國務與統帥之間，</p>
<p>必須指更加密切連繫為一體。現在最高戰爭</p>
<p>指導會議設立目的，最主要的就是使政戰兩</p>
<p>略調整而策定指導戰爭的最高方針。</p>
<p>問：日本作戰已有七年之久，過去早有</p>
<p>策定戰略的最高統帥機關。為什麽又有此新</p>
<p>組織的必要？</p>
<p>答：過去日本決定戰略與統帥的最高機</p>
<p>關是大本營。說到日本的大本營，已有極悠</p>
<p>久的歷史。早在日淸，日俄二役中，即為戰</p>
<p>爭中統帥全局的最高機關，而內閣總理大臣</p>
<p>及樞密院議長則列席大本營會議，實現國務</p>
<p>與統帥一元化的調整。中日事變以來，於民</p>
<p>國二十六年十二月設立的大本營，則在性質</p>
<p>上與日淸日俄二役時之大本營不同，由參謀</p>
<p>總長（現為梅津大將）與軍令部總長（現為</p>
<p>及川大將）為共慕僚長，參贊統帥機密，與</p>
<p>日淸日俄二役時由首相及樞密院議長列席大</p>
<p>本營會議者截然不同，為純粹的最高統帥機</p>
<p>關。在此日趨激烈的戰局之下，統帥不能不</p>
<p>同時具有總理國務之構以應付時局，因此乃</p>
<p>有最高戰爭指導會議之設立。</p>
<p>問：然則最高戰爭指導會議之設，是否</p>
<p>影響到原有統帥與國務兩部份的責任與機能</p>
<p>？</p>
<p>答：這是不會的，原有最高統帥機關是</p>
<p>大本營，最高關務機關是內閣，兩者之間，</p>
<p>本有連絡會議之設。自民國二十六年十一月</p>
<p>以來，始廢止連絡會議，另由大本營與政府</p>
<p>間每週舉行定例會議一次，以交換情報。在</p>
<p>此決戰新階段，為了適應時局的要求，始經</p>
<p>勅裁決定設立最高戰爭指導會議，以期策定</p>
<p>戰爭指導之根本方針，並求政戰兩略之　合</p>
<p>調整，所以，實際上還是大本營與政府間，</p>
<p>原有連絡會議的機能，使之更進一步的加强</p>
<p>與推進，同時，使大本營與政府的責任更加</p>
<p>明確，及其機能更作有效的發揮。</p>
<p>問：然則，這次的最高戰爭指導會議與</p>
<p>大本營政府間的連絡會議，在本質上有何不</p>
<p>同？對今後戰局有何重大意義？</p>
<p>答：以前日本大本營與政府間的連絡會</p>
<p>議，要在交換情報及連絡，現在最高戰爭指</p>
<p>導會議則除此之外，本質上又是一個最高議</p>
<p>決機關，該會議的議決案，一經御裁可，即</p>
<p>可絕對的付諸實施。特別是適應決戰現階段</p>
<p>的內外情勢，對於決戰生產方面的資材，勞</p>
<p>務及生產之分配，對於國內決戰勝利態勢之</p>
<p>澈底完成及國民決戰生活之整備等等，有了</p>
<p>這種統帥　政府一體化的最高指導機關與最</p>
<p>高決議機關，則更可强力有效地實現。所以</p>
<p>我們相信，今後日本的戰爭指導力集中强化</p>
<p>於最高戰爭指導會議，實現政戰兩略一體化</p>
<p>的強力指導，以一億國民一致滅敵的團結力</p>
<p>，必能早日擊潰敵人而獲得勝利。</p>
<h3>遂行大東亞政策貢獻於世界和平　日重光外相昨晚廣播演說</h3>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　日外相兼大東亞相重光葵氏</p>
<p>，二十一日下午七時，在東京中央廣播電臺，對大東亞地域</p>
<p>各國發表廣播演說，題為「關於日本之大東亞政策」，原文</p>
<p>如次：</p>
<p>解放民族束縛恢復自主獨立</p>
<p>日本帝國對立大東亞</p>
<p>地域之政策，已因日本對</p>
<p>華新政策之推進，而得以</p>
<p>明確實現，故對華新政策</p>
<p>實可謂為東亞政策之根基</p>
<p>蓋對華新政策自去年一</p>
<p>月以來，即開始强力推進</p>
<p>，時至今日，殆已完全見</p>
<p>諸實行，不平等條約，亦</p>
<p>因簽訂平等互惠之中·日</p>
<p>同盟條約而得取消。該條</p>
<p>約幷規定，中國實現和平</p>
<p>之時，日本軍隊立時撤兵</p>
<p>，故日本在中國之作戰目</p>
<p>的，不在對付渝方，而為</p>
<p>排除英美之侵略勢力。理</p>
<p>至明顯。同時，東亞政策</p>
<p>亦因對軍新政策之實施，</p>
<p>而得以着着推進，然則東</p>
<p>亞政策其基本意義果何在</p>
<p>乎，此不外在使各民族得</p>
<p>以脫離英美之束縛，解放</p>
<p>出來，從而使構成東亞之</p>
<p>各個份子，得以恢復其眞</p>
<p>實之自主獨立，大東亞政</p>
<p>策之所以為使東亞民族徹</p>
<p>底實現本然姿態之一種政</p>
<p>策，即在於此。時至今日</p>
<p>，東亞之天地，已脫離英</p>
<p>美之束縛，而得到解放，</p>
<p>進而着着實現其傳統之精</p>
<p>神，故大東亞戰爭在大東</p>
<p>亞實為自覺之戰爭，今大</p>
<p>柬亞各國家，各民族已獲</p>
<p>得此自覺，中國亦由此而</p>
<p>得以解放，進而完成其歷</p>
<p>史攸外之完善國家。泰國</p>
<p>亦然，得以完成其獨立願</p>
<p>望，以及緬甸及菲律賓亦</p>
<p>已達成其獨立，但吾人今</p>
<p>日仍有待於各國志士之奮</p>
<p>起，此亦為日本帝國之所</p>
<p>要求者，東亞政策，亦於</p>
<p>此得以奠定其基礎。昭和</p>
<p>十八年（民國三十二年）</p>
<p>十一月，大東亞會議舉行</p>
<p>於東京，其時參加國家除</p>
<p>日本外，有中·滿·泰·</p>
<p>緬·菲律賓等國，此外印</p>
<p>度亦曾參與該會議，在此</p>
<p>次會議中，曾由各國政府</p>
<p>主席宣布實施大東亞宣言</p>
<p>。</p>
<p>促進協力親善開拓共榮天地</p>
<p>大東亞宣言所具之</p>
<p>五項原則，其要旨係在尊</p>
<p>重大東亞各國家·各民族</p>
<p>之自主獨立及促進此等民</p>
<p>族國家之協力親美，並在</p>
<p>使已經解放之亞洲恢復其</p>
<p>傳統創造性，進而本自主</p>
<p>獨立之立場，形成復興東</p>
<p>亞之基礎，則在期此等各</p>
<p>民族，各國家互助協力，</p>
<p>確保東亞之安定，開拓共</p>
<p>榮共存之天地。</p>
<p>大東亞宣言為和平建設憲章</p>
<p>於此次大東亞戰爭</p>
<p>所予東亞人之重大敎訓，</p>
<p>厥有二點，其一，為對自</p>
<p>己力量之信賴，英美　以</p>
<p>條約或甘言欺弄其他民族</p>
<p>，為時已久·蹂躪其他民</p>
<p>族之獨立精神，以物質文</p>
<p>明為武器，使其精神·文</p>
<p>化，備受麻　，然而今日</p>
<p>已經覺悟，對於他人之任</p>
<p>何甘言與諾言，已不足加</p>
<p>以信賴。同時並覺悟，自</p>
<p>身之要求惟有以自身之力</p>
<p>量才能使之實現，除天命</p>
<p>自助而外，實無良圖，故</p>
<p>東亞亦應籍東亞人之力，</p>
<p>才能臻於復興。第二個教</p>
<p>訓為大和精神之發揮，大</p>
<p>和精神不僅存在於大東亞</p>
<p>地域，日擴及於整個世界</p>
<p>，而成為國際關係之基調</p>
<p>，但世界各民族·各國家</p>
<p>，均在平等互惠之原則下</p>
<p>，開發資源，溝通文化，</p>
<p>進而貢獻於世界之進展，</p>
<p>世界和平之基礎，於此方</p>
<p>能完成。關於此點，大東</p>
<p>亞宣言中，亦已有明確之</p>
<p>指示，故大東亞宣言確為</p>
<p>世界和平建設之憲章。</p>
<p>敵人獨佔配企圖昭然若揭</p>
<p>敵人之目的，在水</p>
<p>久東縛　亞洲，無限榨取</p>
<p>東亞，並謀消減亞洲之先</p>
<p>知先覺　日本，以實現彼</p>
<p>等昔日之手段，係謀不戰</p>
<p>而消滅日本。反之，現在</p>
<p>之手段，則謀以武力破壞</p>
<p>日本，乃至整個東亞，於</p>
<p>是日本乃為自身及東亞之</p>
<p>自存自衛，奮然而起。從</p>
<p>而此次戰爭，在東亞實為</p>
<p>迫不得已而發動之戰爭，</p>
<p>最近，英美兩國有識人士</p>
<p>，對於此點亦不得不加以</p>
<p>承認，且已成為世界之問</p>
<p>題，此為衆所週知之事實</p>
<p>，然而彼等為支配世界，</p>
<p>倚仗墨力，以逞其野心，</p>
<p>企圖以開羅會談之决議以</p>
<p>代替大東亞宣言，重謀恣</p>
<p>意處理將來之世界，而加</p>
<p>以獨佔支配，其支配世界</p>
<p>之企圖，已昭然若揭，其</p>
<p>最令人置疑者，即彼等今</p>
<p>一日旣一面逐行世界大戰，</p>
<p>而另一面又積極準備將來</p>
<p>之世界戰爭。</p>
<p>日以舉國強力勇敢貫澈戰爭</p>
<p>此一大戰爭，實為</p>
<p>决定正邪之戰爭，其間自</p>
<p>不免有一進一退之過程，</p>
<p>惟敵人愈向前進，愈加速</p>
<p>陷入危境，而予吾人以可</p>
<p>乘之機會，蓋正義之戰，</p>
<p>必獲最後勝利，此實為古</p>
<p>今之鐵則。此次日內閣更</p>
<p>迭後，日本仍决意維持從</p>
<p>來之外交政策，與盟邦緊</p>
<p>密協力，以舉國一致之强</p>
<p>力熊勢，勇敢貫澈此正義</p>
<p>戰爭，竭力遂行堪稱正義</p>
<p>政策之大東亞政策，同時</p>
<p>更根據大和精神，以大和</p>
<p>精神推進善鄰政策，以永</p>
<p>久確保東亞之安定，進而</p>
<p>貢獻於世界和平，此為吾</p>
<p>人之神聖目的。</p>
<p>關東戰力資源生產成績良好</p>
<p>大連二十一日中央</p>
<p>社電　關東州廳經濟部長</p>
<p>森岡氏，頃就關東州戰力</p>
<p>資源之鹽　生產狀况及食</p>
<p>糧狀况，發表談話如次：</p>
<p>鹽產狀况因氣候適順，成</p>
<p>績極為良好，料想決能突</p>
<p>破本年度之目標。又飛機</p>
<p>必需品　之原料鹽　生產</p>
<p>成績亦相當良好，故明年</p>
<p>之飛機增產頗堪期待，農</p>
<p>作物於播種時，雖未降雨</p>
<p>，但最近已逐漸好轉，因</p>
<p>之當能確保本年度之收成</p>
<p>。關於棉布等生活物資少</p>
<p>特配，與滿洲國同時並行</p>
<p>，現新築三十間農業倉庫</p>
<p>，本年秋季即可完成。</p>
<h3>敵機再襲九州　仍未能收效</h3>

<p>日黃昏敵機空襲九州及中</p>

<p>機損失三架。　衝攻敵機</p>
<p>壯烈陣亡者如次：陸軍習</p>
<p>長山田守，軍曹野邊重夫</p>
<p>，兵長高木傳藏。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央</p>
<p>社電　美空軍於二十日薄</p>
<p>暮來襲日本北九州，至是</p>
<p>日深夜，復再度來襲，其</p>
<p>一部並侵入中國地方北部</p>
<p>，以遭日軍防空部隊之邀</p>
<p>擊，殆未能得逞，遂即遁</p>
<p>去。敵機係採用分散空襲</p>
<p>法，以一架一架分別侵入</p>
<p>，以在黑夜不能發見目標</p>
<p>，不能侵入重耍地域，僅</p>
<p>於郊外山野中投下炸彈，</p>
<p>燒夷彈，照明彈等，地上</p>
<p>雖有若干處起火，但立即</p>
<p>被消滅，故損失甚少。敵</p>
<p>機之來製，仍利用晝間轟</p>
<p>炸所發生之火災，圖於夜</p>
<p>襲中擴大戰果，但首次之</p>
<p>薄暮空製所發生之之火災，</p>
<p>亦悉於二次空襲前撲滅，</p>
<p>故敵軍之攻擊未能收得若</p>
<p>襲之美機共約八十架，內</p>
<p>中約損失三成，且未獲絲</p>
<p>毫之成果，其所企圖悉歸</p>
<p>失敗。又敵繼除損失二十</p>
<p>三架外，其未能歸還基地</p>
<p>者料亦為數不少，反之，</p>
<p>日方除提失三架外，亦有</p>
<p>若干機身中彈者。美陸軍</p>
<p>部本欲以此次之轟炸為正</p>
<p>規空襲日本之出發點，故</p>
<p>對之期望甚股，然由於日</p>

<p>社電　日本農商省為擴充</p>
<p>麥類之種植面積，去年曾</p>
<p>提倡改良農地，結果本年</p>
<p>之播種面積已增至百八十</p>
<p>七萬公頃，來年麥類之播</p>
<p>種面積，將更擴大，由於</p>
<p>各種硏究之結果，利用荒</p>
<p>蕪閑地及改良旣有農地，</p>
<p>其面積又新增加十萬公頃</p>
<p>，總計二百十萬公頃，距</p>

<h3>渝共前途暗礁重重</h3>
<p>中央社訊　關於渝</p>
<p>共糾紛，最近渝方雖表示</p>
<p>有改善合作之希望，而共</p>
<p>黨方面對渝方之聲明又加</p>
<p>以不滿，其前途暗礁重重</p>
<p>，殊難合作。頃據可靠方</p>
<p>面消息，關於最近之渝共</p>
<p>內容頗詳，茲分誌如次：</p>
<p>上次西安會談之結果，中</p>
<p>共代表林祖涵之訪渝，雙</p>
<p>方會談後之始未，迄今猶</p>
<p>無明期之表現。惟據七月</p>
<p>二十六日渝方宣傳部畏梁</p>
<p>塞操，在定例會見外籍記</p>
<p>者時，對於渝共調整之經</p>
<p>過，發表談話。據梁所述</p>
<p>，渝共雙方之關係調整</p>
<p>困難太多</p>
<p>解決障</p>
<p>碍之</p>
<p>結，雖共黨在表面上與國</p>
<p>民黨之合作，在事實上共</p>
<p>黨所定之信念，及所述之</p>
<p>言論絕對相反。而渝蔣為</p>
<p>求解決雙方之縣案，乃提</p>
<p>出提來如下：　渝方承認</p>
<p>共黨為合法地位。　將十</p>
<p>八集團軍改編為四軍十二</p>
<p>師，此項軍隊之改編，由</p>
<p>渝方所統屬。　渝方承認</p>
<p>邊區政府繼續存在，向歸</p>
<p>省政府所管轄之區亦由渝</p>
<p>方直接統制。　將來舉行</p>
<p>國民會議時，渝方承認各</p>
<p>黨各派亨受平等地位。關</p>
<p>於此項國民黨之提案，延</p>
<p>安方面尚未提出正式答覆</p>
<p>，惟只提出十七個要求條</p>
<p>件，會於三個月前經渝共</p>
<p>代表交涉商榷，但在原則</p>
<p>上則</p>
<p>根本不同</p>
<p>而渝方</p>
<p>為調整</p>
<p>雙方關係，儘量繼續努力</p>
<p>，妥謀改善方法，然處境</p>
<p>相當困難。本來渝方之觀</p>
<p>點，及延安政權之觀點上</p>
<p>，而梁竟謂在車實上無多</p>
<p>大紛歧，且謂已局部解決</p>
<p>，成立諒解云云。自梁發</p>
<p>表上述談話後，共黨方面</p>
<p>周恩來於八月十二日，在</p>
<p>延安向新華日報記者發表</p>
<p>談話，辯駁梁之談話。周</p>
<p>謂渝共關係之改善調整，</p>
<p>素可負責鞏明，渝方無論</p>
<p>在具體上及微小問題，對</p>
<p>共黨毫無解決、對於　共</p>
<p>觀點之紛歧，及根本解決</p>
<p>之因難，則為一般對國內</p>
<p>外關心兩黨關係之人士，</p>
<p>一種</p>
<p>錯誤見解</p>
<p>故在雙</p>
<p>方解決</p>
<p>問題之原則上，有頗大注</p>
<p>視。此外對於陣碍之不得</p>
<p>解決，責任非在共黨，實</p>
<p>由於渝國民黨之獨裁所致</p>
<p>。是以梁之談話，不偏於</p>
<p>事實，蓋共黨之提案在前</p>
<p>，而渝方之要求於後，惟</p>
<p>共黨為委屈求全計，對於</p>
<p>提案改為書面十一件、口</p>
<p>頭上為八件，於六月五日</p>
<p>交與渝代表張治中、工</p>
<p>杰兩人。但渝方之提案，</p>
<p>與共黨意見相　過遠，而</p>
<p>周氏之鄭市聲明，謂共</p>
<p>所提倏件　二十條並非十</p>
<p>二條。關於共黨條件之軍</p>
<p>要性，　實行民主政治，</p>
<p>保障人民　論，及出版集</p>

<p>承認中共與各黨各派為合</p>

<p>渝方</p>
<p>應編制</p>
<p>共軍五軍十六師，且助以</p>

<p>承認綏甘寗邊區，及華</p>
<p>北華中華南各根據地之民</p>
<p>選政府，為合法之地方自</p>
<p>治政府。　渝方撤消各邊</p>
<p>區之軍事經濟封鎖。　停</p>
<p>止對共軍軍事進攻。　要</p>
<p>求渝方將英美之援助中國</p>
<p>物資，彈械藥品金錢。應</p>
<p>按照正　比例，分配十八</p>
<p>集團　及新四軍。　要求</p>
<p>方　　合撤消蔑視中共，</p>
<p>與進攻十八集團軍新四軍</p>
<p>之奸黨、　軍　區之稱呼</p>
<p>。　停止恃務工作人員對</p>
<p>中其十八　　軍新四軍之</p>
<p>破壞工作。　　禁止在報</p>
<p>上披露對中共之造謠。</p>
<p>釋放各地被捕人員。</p>

<p>往返自由</p>
<p>並得在</p>
<p>該地居</p>
<p>住，及購買生活必需品之</p>
<p>自由。周恩來曾謂共黨所</p>
<p>提條件，頃仍進行談判，</p>
<p>並無終止，其內藏危機猶</p>
<p>未過去。惟自周發表談話</p>
<p>後，渝方頗為不滿，在入</p>
<p>月十六日，　寒操接見外</p>
<p>記者時，又提出該點稱</p>
<p>中共情形，據渝方情報與</p>
<p>周之發表聲明，不同點頗</p>
<p>多，在渝方所獲之事實相</p>
<p>反，故指周應負担相當責</p>
<p>任。故渝共之關係及今後</p>
<p>之合作，在共黨之立場以</p>
<p>觀，事實上難以合作云。</p>

<h3>法政府訓令德古　授管理越南全權　越定明日召開最高評議會</h3>
<p>西貢二十一日中央社電　越南政廳頃發表，法政府令將管理越南全權授與德古總督，命令大意謂：查越南總督之一切法定權，向取得本國政府之承認，茲本國政府鑒於目前情勢嚴重，深恐日後越南方面與本國政府間有斷絕運絡之處，特將今後決定權限授與德古總督。按此種措置，早在一般預料中，試就一九四三年二月十八日所公布之法律觀之，該法案第九十號條謂，若一旦與本國斷絕電信聯絡時，即授與特別權，該法律乃依據憲法第十二條及同條附則，經閣議之承認而規定者，原文如次：（第一條）當法本國與印度支那間斷絕運絡時期，依據現存法律，凡必須經本國政府承認及決定實施之權限，均臨時授與總督。（下略）該項全權之授與，即法政府對德古總督之訓電，縱非完全斷絕時，憂同樣生效。德古總督在越南戰時措置之實施上，實已獲得與前首相同等之地位，由日本方面觀之，越南今後於履行防衛協定及與日本維持盟約國間之友好關係上，定能一秉初衷，日加增進。</p>
<p>東京二十一日中央社電　越南政府二十日下午八時廣播發表：政府將一切權限授與德古總督，使獲得戰時措置之獨裁地位，同時并發表關於該事件之聲明，從此越南之戰時體制將益見強化，在德古總督之領導下，當以大東亞之一環向前邁進。德古總督爲此，於日前邀請最高評議會議員及各州理事長官舉行懇談，聞二十三日起將正式召開最高評議會議及理事長官會議，該會議長德古總督將正式表明全權委任事實，要求與以支援，同時并就推進今後協力日本政策及越南之重要問題，有所協議。</p>

<p>騰越等地日軍戰況</p>
<p>滇頃前綫二十一日中央社電　騰越正面渝軍，十五日黎明在有力之砲火掩護下，進攻日軍陣地正面，日軍當即邀戰，激戰多時，除騰越南門附近之一部外，全綫渝軍概被擊退。十四日至十六日三日間，渝軍棄屍達四百四十餘具，日軍陣亡四十八名。拉孟渝軍，自十四日以來，亦迭次來攻，皆被擊退，十四，十五兩日，渝軍棄屍八十五具，重機槍，迫擊砲各一門，日軍犧牲三名。龍陵方面，日軍邀擊來襲東側陣地之渝軍，將之擊退，該市北方之渝軍陣地，砲火逐次增列，是日，渝軍約六百由國昌街來襲，日軍與之激戰後，將之擊退。十五，十六兩日，該地渝軍棄屍六百九十具，日軍陣亡十三名。芒市周邊之渝軍，十六日以來，漸次活動，是日，渝軍約五百，來襲北部陣地，日軍當即反擊，此役渝軍棄屍二十具而去，日軍僅陣亡六名。</p>

<h3>勝利的要素（一）</h3>
<p>— 白鳥敏夫</p>
<p>——擊滅敵美的野心——</p>
<p>白鳥敏夫氏現年五十八歲，大正三年，畢業於東大，入外務省服務，昭和四年任情報部第二課長，五年任情報部長，日本退出國際聯盟時，以發言人資格，盡其重大任務。昭和八年，以特命全權公使，駐　瑞典，兼駐挪威丹麥。昭和十三年九月，任駐義大利大使，對於日德義防共軸心之締結，厥功甚偉。昭和十五年退官，第二次近衛內閣時，任外交顧問。現任衆議員議員，盟邦同志會長。</p>
<p>日本有三個敵人——英·美·重慶。這裏祇想考察怎樣打倒美國，對重慶姑作別論。美國物量的豐富，今日認也知道的。這毋甯說過於強調了一點。然則美國祇是物量的車家，精神上毫不是取的嗎？那又未必盡然。美國本來是各種人種所組成，縣建國歷史又短，所以尚不能說是完全的國家。一有戰爭發生，便蘊蓄著種種弱點。但至少其國民的六七成出自歐洲民族中比較優秀的民族，可是作爲個別的人看來，確有著不能看得太高的人們。</p>
<p>美國人民戰意的根源</p>
<p>戰爭開始後，已經三年了。美國的國內態勢迄今尚未發生重大的破綻。戰爭的犧牲雖大，但一般民衆的戰意卻極旺盛，這與我們戰前所想的略有不同，而似出乎意外。</p>
<p>他們戰意旺盛的原因何在呢？第一，美國人民是窩　的，　一，二年的戰局他們認爲有利地展開　。第二，軍需生產今日達最高峯。這與我國比較起來，大不相同。所以對物量的優越，他們抱著自信。第三，根據英美優越感而　視有的人種。他們開口自由，閉口平等，其實是人種偏見非常強的國民。這是美國國內對黑人優越感的由來。這優越感擴而充之，對所有變色民族，他們有非常的優越感，縱對我國，在諸戰期中　受重大打擊，優越感一時漸見減退，但後來跟著戰局的變化，又故　復　了。</p>
<p>戰事初期中大吃敗仗。最後都有了誓報珍珠灣之仇的心緒。政府亦寫了「記住珍珠灣」的標語，努力宣傳。這對單純的美國人民，發生了意外的影響，對日本的敵愾心非常堅強。要之，他們的戰意，是對日本敵愾心的激烈，對物量的妄信，他們自負最後勝利殆已確定，這是來自民族的優越感等要素，他們的戰意，拿來分析起來看，就像上面所說毫無根據，一吹即散的。所以祇要戰塲的情勢一度逆轉，立即感到幻滅的悲哀。我以爲美國人民縱能忍受任何困難，縱變成長期戰，無論如何不會有堅持至最後熱忱與決心。</p>
<p>羅斯福之所以希望短期戰者，實欲在物量已達頂點，國民的戰意最昂揚的今日，一舉而致勝。否則民心必趨弛緩，厭戰氣氛橫流，且三年來整頓戰時態勢之結果所　感之各種國內態勢，必將產生破綻。在反動期未來之前，不結束戰爭，則不可收　。這是羅斯福急求短期決戰的理由。後方的民心如不動搖，縱變成長期戰，美國國必不致動搖。羅斯福所苦者，對於國民的士氣，國民的戰意沒有自信。</p>
<p>從這種戰時美國之精神的要素看來，可見其基礎頗爲薄弱。不像德國和日本般，清楚地自覺戰爭的目的，有不顧任何犧牲，戰至最後的堅固基礎。</p>
<p>猶太人的野心</p>
<p>但這裏我們須得深思者，羅斯福以次的美國指導者們的戰意，頗爲鞏固而旺盛。說到美國的指導者，大家都知道是金權財閥，即猶太人及互助團的同黨。大　在一般美國民衆看來，縱使此次戰爭中他們失敗，日本和　國都不會奪取美國。祇要約定不干涉亞洲及歐洲就可以結束。但縱其指導者即猶太人看來，這戰爭是幾　紀來一舉而欲完成制新世界之野心。這戰爭　失敗，不僅他們制　世界的幻夢一舉幻滅，並將引起全世界的大規模排猶，而導致民族於滅亡。所以從他們看來，是無論如何不能敗北的戰爭。普通總說英美國民沒有戰爭的目的。一般國民或許如此，但他們的指導者，抱著制　世界的野心。英美及戰收前的法國，完全爲了這關係而互相攜手。猶太世界是怎樣的世界呢，大體就今日爲止他們的行動看來，可清楚地看出其輪廓。不過以前是資本主義，共產主義二種勢力所推進的世界。這不如說是過渡的方策，最後的目的我以爲是世界共產化。他們並想將英車和美國亦依此而行。他們打算用猶太的權力來掌握這些國家的政府，直接支配世界。用全力與操縱輿論的間接方法不僅手段　和，而在這戰爭的慘禍之後，假令他們勝利亦有追究戰爭責任之懼，所以無論如何不能不用獨裁　制壓之。在美國，羅斯福甚至欲連任兩屆總統，計劃爲獨裁者，一面施行新分配制度，把握勞　階段，於是獨裁的基礎已告穩固。他們以爲美國之傾於共產，已指日可待了。</p>
<p>猶太人的理想世界，是用這種種有獨裁權的力　，壓制非猶太民族，一面他們並用抽　積儲起來的二百數十億金元，發行猶太貨幣，在政治，經濟上壓制世界，於是至最後階段，以愛華伯神祭奉爲宇宙絕對之神，令全人類拜倒此神下面，使猶太的希望所抱的宿願。如此看來，猶太人的非望，怎樣違反日本國體的本義，即八　一宇的宏謨，一望可知了。</p>
<p>有人不是說，在新幾尼亞，在馬紹爾，或在馬利亞納，不惜浩大犧牲而來犯的敵兵的戰意，不是極熾列而不容輕視的嗎？但這是他們指導者們的國內宣傳策略，如上所述，不僅美國人，是人類共有的鬥爭性，是他們戰意的由來，大概任何民族，一至戰塲，戰鬥起來都相當勇敢。他們自以爲將近勝利，因而有某種程度的勇敢，並不是不可思議的。（　譯自七月十二日每日新聞）</p>

<h3>油糧統制會辦理　食油存貨登記　防止囤積操縱抑平巿價</h3>
<p>商統會油糧統制委員會自改組成立後，對於油糧統一管理辦法，刻</p>
<p>正在積極研究具體方案實施中。惟鑒於近日食用油價，漲勢甚厲，雖因</p>
<p>消費量增多，但其中一般投機商操縱居奇，　抬售價，亦為最大　結。</p>
<p>茲為明瞭上海地區食油存銷狀况，防止囤積居奇，以期抑平市價起見，</p>
<p>特制定上海地區食用油存貨買賣臨時登記規則，業與有關各當局商得同</p>
<p>意，凡製造商販賣商及零售商，應於本月廿六日以前，將所有存貨向大</p>
<p>上海路（即舊愛多亞路十五號）上海區食用油業同業公會登記。茲將該</p>
<p>項登記規則誌下：</p>
<p>登記規則</p>
<p>上海地區食用油存貨買賣臨時登記規則：第一</p>
<p>條，為明瞭上海地區食用油存銷狀况起見，依</p>
<p>照油糧統一管理暫行辦法第五六兩條之規定，</p>
<p>制定本規則，前項上海地區係指統制綫以內者。第二條，製造商販賣商</p>
<p>及零售商，應於八月廿六日以前，將所有存貨向上海區食用油業同業公</p>
<p>會（組合）（以下簡稱公會）登記之。但存貨未滿五祖者，得免予登記</p>
<p>。第三條，自八月廿六日起，製造商應每日將製品及買賣數量，販賣商</p>
<p>應侮日將買賣數量，零售商應侮半月將買賣數量，分別向公會登記之。</p>
<p>第四條，前兩條之登記用紙，由公曾照另定式樣印發之。第五條，公會</p>
<p>應將第二三兩條規定之登記情形，轉報聯合會，彙呈全國商業統制總會</p>
<p>油糧統制委員會。第六條，公會對已遵照辦理第二三兩條規定登記之會</p>
<p>員，給予另定式探之證明書。第七條，會員有違反本規則規定者，或有</p>
<p>隱匿虛報情事者，依照囤積主要商品治罪條例，呈請主管當局依法處罰</p>
<p>之。第八條，本規則呈請全國商業統制總會備案。</p>
<p>決不收買</p>
<p>據油糧統制委員會負責人稱：本規則之實施，</p>
<p>其目的並不在收買存貨，或對買賣加以任何限</p>
<p>制，僅擬將流通過程趨於明瞭，以商人自治之</p>
<p>精神，防止業外人暨不肖同業之投機操縱而已。</p>
<h3>特稅處舞弊案　續有三名被扣　帮辦科長及兩主任</h3>
<p>本市財政當局為處理特稅科舞弊一案，業</p>
<p>將該科科長鄒紹基，幫辦科長徐晟貴，主任吳</p>
<p>松齡，朱俊卿等四人，予以扣押，聽候偵訊，</p>
<p>所有特稅科科長一職，由局派第三科科長史華</p>
<p>，暫行兼代。查史氏自一九三二年始即於前工</p>
<p>部局任財務處律師，於財局接管一區財務處後</p>
<p>，始任地捐科長，今後諒能克已奉公。</p>
<h3>食米登記要點　條文更正</h3>
<p>經濟保安處前發表「</p>
<p>食米登記手續要領中」，</p>
<p>其中一三兩條更正如下：</p>
<p>經濟保安處手續之要領：</p>
<p>已登記完畢之食</p>
<p>米，雖登記規定量以內」</p>
<p>，係「雖登記規定量以上</p>
<p>」之誤。</p>
<p>「向本處物品配給</p>
<p>處登記之後，如購新米之</p>
<p>時，而登記完畢之餘米，</p>
<p>如若超過規定量，限三日</p>
<p>丙用書面報告，向本處提</p>
<p>出」，應改為「向本處及</p>
<p>市政府物品配給處登記完</p>
<p>畢後之剩米，與購買新米</p>
<p>之合併數量，若超過前登</p>
<p>記之數量時，限三日內用</p>
<p>書面報告向本處提出」。</p>

<p>止。</p>

<p>於管理本市各廣告商辦法</p>
<p>，亦經修訂，並呈准市府</p>
<p>公佈施行，凡本市經營廣</p>
<p>告業務者，除領有經濟局</p>
<p>商業執照外，均應向該局</p>
<p>申誠登記，領取廣告商執</p>
<p>業證明書，方可營業。</p>

<h3>法商慈善獎券　巿府令禁發行　從未呈請我國政府核准</h3>
<p>「法商慈善獎券」發</p>
<p>行以來，從未呈請我國政</p>

<p>且發行獎券，絕非普通商</p>
<p>業，不僅外人不得在我國</p>
<p>境內發行，即本國人民，</p>
<p>非經主管官署特准，亦不</p>
<p>得貿然發行。復查該法商</p>
<p>獎券，購券者純為我國民</p>
<p>衆，而受惠者並非我國同</p>
<p>胞，尤背法理人情。社會</p>
<p>福利部據各界控吿後，經</p>
<p>派人調查屬實，除通知外</p>
<p>交部財政部查照外，並咨</p>
<p>請上海特別市政府勒令該</p>
<p>公司於八月底停止發行，</p>
<p>辦理結束，並令將過去帳</p>
<p>目公開宣佈。本市市政府</p>
<p>復經轉飭社會福利局及警</p>
<p>察局，派員前往執行，社</p>

<h3>海軍</h3>
<p>— 石田豐堆著　洋譯</p>
<p>一早就到了吳鎭，隆夫認為這最合適。</p>
<p>因為他能在　人上班前見面，可以商量逗遛</p>
<p>於吳鎭的事。至於談妹妹婚姻大事的任務，</p>
<p>當然在心中念念不忘，這是用不着筆者多費</p>
<p>筆墨的，此外在心坎上還留着眞人前此所允</p>
<p>諾的參觀軍港事。隆夫盡量不想打攪眞人的</p>
<p>軍務，結果如願以償。</p>
<p>（擾醒眞人的睡限，或許他會原諒的吧</p>
<p>！）</p>
<p>隆夫坐上心中記住的公共汽車。初夏天</p>
<p>亮早的太陽，還未露出頭來。吳鎭上最出名</p>
<p>的職工拖着走的木屐聲音，尚未在馬路上作響。</p>
<p>隆夫在山平地誠的一個汽車站上下來，順着</p>
<p>有晨霧的河流，向前走。他的心在志忑地跳動着</p>
<p>。這是將君到眞人的高興，也是害羞。</p>
<p>（別的話都好說，只有婚姻這件事不好說出</p>
<p>口。如說，要我妹妹吧，眞人聽了一定會臉紅的</p>
<p>。若是我，就這樣。妹妹喜歡你，這話眞無法說</p>
<p>出口。）</p>
<p>隆夫對於這樣自抱奮勇，輕易答應下來的事</p>
<p>情，現在發見執行之難了。這樣話從母親來的信</p>
<p>中也曾提到過，於是他搔頭糜耳地感覺到難了。</p>
<p>不多時問，走到了眞人宿舍的門前、二樓置</p>
<p>人的書房，還關着窗戶。</p>
<p>（好像還在睡覺。呌醒，眞有點對不起。）</p>
<p>但眞人又不是還需要到周圍轉一圈的客氣朋</p>
<p>友。</p>
<p>他用手轉前門的把手，但裏面上着鎖未能推</p>
<p>開、轉到後門去看看廚房，而剛剛起來的老板娘</p>
<p>，表示着很吃驚的神色，凝視着隆夫。</p>
<p>「谷君還未起來麼？」</p>
<p>「呵，客人來得這樣早……」</p>
<p>老板娘急忙整理着亂髮和衣服，客客氣氣地</p>
<p>問禮。</p>
<p>「回東京路過此地，又來添麻煩了。因火車</p>
<p>關係來得太早了。」</p>
<p>隆夫想從廚房上樓，而就跑進屋子裏了。</p>
<p>「但，眞對不起，谷先生己經不在此地了…</p>
<p>…」</p>
<p>老板娘覺着惋惜地這樣說了。</p>
<p>「呵？」</p>
<p>「因任務關係，突然前天退租了，—」</p>
<p>「那末是出港了麼？」</p>
<p>「但什麽也沒有說。不僅谷先生，就是海軍</p>
<p>軍人全體都是守口如瓶的，—」</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>吳鎭對於預防間諜的思想眞普遍，老板娘的</p>
<p>話或許故意造做，然而眞人不在宿舍，這却是事</p>
<p>實。</p>
<p>隆夫在一星期前碰見眞人的時候，曾留下了</p>
<p>一個很忙的印像，所以此次未得見面，也並不奇</p>
<p>怪，但只有未得談妹妹的婚事，却覺着無限的悵</p>
<p>惘。</p>
<p>然而婚事的任務，他認為可以用別種方法解</p>
<p>決的。</p>
<p>（這沒有關係，寫信也可以，再來也可以。</p>
<p>像吳鎭這樣距離的地方，來多少趟也沒有關係，</p>
<p>—）</p>
<p>他又返回到車站，吃完早飯，就坐尾之道行</p>
<p>的火車走了。在瀨戶內的古港上散步，並且遠望</p>
<p>着成為平靜海洋畫材料的風景，等到兩點半到東</p>
<p>京去的快車走時，才不看風景了。</p>
<p>這趟火車也同樣很擁擠，一直到了神戶才有</p>
<p>座位坐。因為昨夜坐車過於疲倦了，所以立刻進</p>
<p>入睡鄕。</p>
<p>到東京車站，業已將近早晨七點鐘。公寓生</p>
<p>活是不舒服的，就是回去也沒有人給預備飯，所</p>
<p>以就在東京車站的食堂裹吃了一些早點。</p>
<p>吃着飯，他突然想到，須把父親給市來畫家</p>
<p>的禮物送去。因為是薩摩窰出的花瓶，所以很怕</p>
<p>打破，就只把這一件東西放到手提箱裹了。</p>
<p>他又回到站台，坐山之手車了。然後從五反</p>
<p>田鐸換池上電車。</p>
<p>到洗足畫家的家，雖然尚是早晨，但因為是</p>
<p>初夏，也熱得滿頭大汗了。這時候正是畫家剛剛</p>
<p>起來洗臉的辰光。</p>
<p>「家嚴命我特別向您致意問候。家嚴本想給</p>
<p>先生敬贈一份克爾干式點心，曾向各處探聽，但</p>
<p>近來因材料缺乏，鹿兒島已經不能作了。」</p>
<p>這樣說着，隆夫就把花瓶箱遲過去了。</p>
<p>「我並不喜歡那種點心呵！可是鹿兒島怎樣</p>
<p>了？還一仍故舊麼？士族還是仗勢凌人麼？」</p>
<p>「但那也不至於。」</p>
<p>隆夫這樣回答着，但聽到巿來畫家照例這樣</p>
<p>腔調時，而才感覺到是回到東京了。</p>
<p>後來就談到畫的間題上，一直到十點多鐘，</p>
<p>他才興辭而退。太疲倦了，所以想睡一午覺，於</p>
<p>是一直就回大沼公寓去了。</p>
<p>「噢，你回來了？眞快呀！你不在家的期間</p>
<p>，有信來了。」</p>
<p>老板娘遞過四五封信來，其中有一封是眞人</p>
<p>的筆跡，而是很厚的信封。（一三四）</p>

<h3>早日頒發紗布價金</h3>
<p>— 李懋庸</p>
<p>自去年八月政府明令收買棉紗布以來，迄</p>
<p>今已時逾一年，在此遙長之一年之中，商統總</p>
<p>會之上海之收買檢收工作，時作時輟，迄尚未</p>
<p>全部完成。恪遵政府命令之良善商民，將所有</p>
<p>紗布存量呈報當局，妥善保存，無日不望商統</p>
<p>總會前來檢收，早日頒發定期存單，以便完成</p>
<p>政府功令。其中已蒙檢收者固有，迄未檢收者</p>
<p>亦復不少。至於價金未曾檢收者未能領到在商</p>
<p>統會正屬名正言順，（何日能蒙檢收是另外的</p>
<p>事）。已檢收者則時逾二，三月尚未領到價金</p>
<p>同業之中有於五，六</p>
<p>月份即蒙檢收者，日逐差</p>
<p>員候於商統會之門，六十</p>
<p>餘日至今尚未核算完畢。</p>
<p>本月以來，計算完成者更</p>
<p>絕無僅有，揭示板上每日</p>
<p>空白，或有詢之者，亦无</p>
<p>切實之答覆。</p>
<p>鑒於以上之事實，我</p>
<p>們希望：</p>
<p>商統會應規定在紗</p>
<p>布檢收後之一定時日以內</p>
<p>，將價格核算完畢，頒發</p>
<p>定期存單。</p>
<p>商統會在若千時旦</p>
<p>以內，必將未曾檢收之紗</p>
<p>布，檢收完畢。</p>
<p>頒發價金之次序，</p>
<p>以檢收時之時日為先後，</p>
<p>不得越序提先。</p>
<p>商統會為商人集合之</p>
<p>機構，而會訓又為「公正</p>
<p>廉明」。想必能接受以上</p>
<p>的提議，消除商人不應受</p>
<p>的疾苦的。</p>
<h3>義務感化戒煙　第三批戒畢</h3>
<p>本處特約南通路中教</p>
<p>道義會，附設道義感化臨</p>
<p>時義務戒烟所，第三次集</p>
<p>團戒烟，共有十人，均係</p>
<p>女性，業已完畢。於昨日</p>
<p>上午，在該會大禮堂，舉</p>
<p>行送別禮，到各界來賓百</p>
<p>餘人，由李慧法先生主席</p>
<p>，致開會詞，對於雅片流</p>
<p>毒，抉發無遺，並力勸出</p>
<p>所之後，萬弗重蹈覆轍，</p>
<p>自絕於人，情詞懇擊，溢</p>
<p>於言表。次由該所主任醫</p>
<p>師楊郁生，孫為瑞，華生</p>
<p>藥物研究所代表孫善君醫</p>
<p>師，及來賓等致詞，語多</p>
<p>勗勉，聞者動容。末由受</p>
<p>戒人代表致謝詞，報告戒</p>
<p>烟經過，並言中一婦人，</p>
<p>每日須打嗎咖針二百餘枚</p>
<p>，又有一婦，日吸白粉八</p>
<p>百餘元，皆藉「聖康毒平</p>
<p>」針劑，安然戒除，大凡</p>
<p>嗜毒之人，往往存一畏懼</p>
<p>心理，以為戒烟痛苦，如</p>
<p>何如何，但證明經過情形</p>
<p>，是不盡然，只要有決心</p>
<p>，決無不能戒除之理。吾</p>
<p>輩既蒙中教道義會超拔苦</p>
<p>海，自是感激不盡，並應</p>
<p>力為宣揚，俾同病者，亦</p>
<p>可得濟迷川，渡登彼岸，</p>

<h3>Japan's Supreme War Guidance Council</h3>
<p>Q: Since the establishment of the Koiso Cabinet, it has been actively strengthening the decisive battle posture. Recently, the Supreme War Guidance Council has been set up. What is the significance of this?</p>
<p>A: Regarding the recent establishment of the "Supreme War Guidance Council" in Japan, judging from the announced information, it is undoubtedly an important measure in the new stage of the decisive battle, and it has a great relationship to the future of the country and the Greater East Asia War. In his first speech after the inauguration ceremony, Prime Minister Koiso mentioned that Japan is currently in a fierce battle, and that there must be a closer connection between state affairs and command. The main purpose of establishing the Supreme War Guidance Council now is to adjust the political and military strategies and formulate the supreme policy for guiding the war.</p>
<p>Q: Japan has been fighting for seven years, and there has long been a supreme command organ for formulating strategies. Why is this new organization necessary?</p>
<p>A: In the past, the highest body in Japan for deciding strategy and command was the Imperial General Headquarters. Speaking of Japan's Imperial General Headquarters, it has a very long history. As early as the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, it was the highest organ for commanding the overall situation in the war, and the Prime Minister of the Cabinet and the President of the Privy Council attended the Imperial General Headquarters meeting to realize the integration of state affairs and command. Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Imperial General Headquarters established in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China is different in nature from the Imperial General Headquarters during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. The Chief of the General Staff (currently General Umezu) and the Chief of the Naval General Staff (currently General Oikawa) are co-chiefs of staff, participating in confidential military affairs, which is completely different from the Prime Minister and the President of the Privy Council attending the Imperial General Headquarters meetings during the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars. It is a purely supreme command organ. Under this increasingly fierce war situation, the commander-in-chief must also have the structure of governing state affairs in order to cope with the situation. Therefore, the Supreme War Guidance Council was established.</p>
<p>Q: Then, will the establishment of the Supreme War Guidance Council affect the responsibilities and functions of the original command and state affairs departments?</p>
<p>A: This will not happen. The original supreme command organ is the Imperial General Headquarters, and the supreme state affairs organ is the Cabinet. There was originally a liaison conference between the two. Since November of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the liaison conference was abolished, and a regular meeting was held between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government once a week to exchange information. In this new stage of the decisive battle, in order to adapt to the requirements of the times, the Supreme War Guidance Council was established after imperial sanction, in order to formulate the fundamental policy of war guidance and seek the integration and adjustment of political and military strategies. Therefore, in reality, it is still the function of the original liaison conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government, making it further strengthened and promoted. At the same time, it makes the responsibilities of the Imperial General Headquarters and the government more clear, and their functions more effectively utilized.</p>
<p>Q: Then, what is the essential difference between this Supreme War Guidance Council and the liaison conference between the Imperial General Headquarters and the government? What is the significance for the future war situation?</p>
<p>A: The previous liaison conference between the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters and the government was for exchanging information and liaison. Now, in addition to this, the Supreme War Guidance Council is essentially a supreme decision-making body. Once the resolutions of the conference are approved by imperial sanction, they can be absolutely implemented. In particular, in order to adapt to the current internal and external situation of the decisive battle, for the materials, labor, and production distribution in the production aspect of the decisive battle, for the thorough completion of the victory posture of the decisive battle in the country, and for the preparation of the national decisive battle life, etc., with this supreme guidance organ and supreme decision-making organ that integrates the command and the government, it can be more powerfully and effectively realized. Therefore, we believe that Japan's war guidance power will be concentrated and strengthened in the Supreme War Guidance Council in the future, realizing the strong guidance of the integration of political and military strategies, and with the unity of 100 million people to destroy the enemy, we will surely defeat the enemy and achieve victory as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Contributing to World Peace by Implementing the Greater East Asia Policy: Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's Broadcast Speech Last Night</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister and Minister of Greater East Asia, Shigemitsu Kui, gave a broadcast speech to various countries in the Greater East Asia region at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station at 7:00 p.m. on the 21st, entitled "On Japan's Greater East Asia Policy." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Liberating National Shackles and Restoring Autonomous Independence</p>
<p>The policy of the Empire of Japan toward the Greater East Asia region has been clearly realized due to the promotion of Japan's new policy toward China. Therefore, the new policy toward China can be said to be the foundation of East Asia policy. Since January of last year, the new policy toward China has been vigorously promoted, and today, it has almost been fully implemented. Unequal treaties have also been abolished due to the signing of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty of Equality and Mutual Benefit. The treaty also stipulates that when China achieves peace, Japanese troops will immediately withdraw. Therefore, Japan's war aims in China are not to deal with the Chongqing side, but to eliminate the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. The principle is very clear. At the same time, the East Asia policy has been steadily promoted due to the implementation of the new military policy. So, what is the basic significance of the East Asia policy? This is nothing more than enabling all nations to break away from the shackles of Britain and the United States, liberate themselves, and thus enable each component of East Asia to restore its true autonomy and independence. The reason why the Greater East Asia policy is a policy to thoroughly realize the original posture of the East Asian nations lies in this. Today, the world of East Asia has broken away from the shackles of Britain and the United States and has been liberated, and is further steadily realizing its traditional spirit. Therefore, the Greater East Asia War is actually a war of consciousness in Greater East Asia. Today, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have gained this consciousness, and China has also been liberated as a result, and has further completed its perfect nation in history. Thailand is also able to fulfill its desire for independence, and Myanmar and the Philippines have also achieved their independence. However, we still look forward to the rise of patriots from all countries today, which is also what the Empire of Japan requires. The East Asia policy is also able to lay its foundation here. In November of the 18th year of Showa (32nd year of the Republic of China), the Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo. At that time, the participating countries, in addition to Japan, included China, Manchukuo, Thailand, Myanmar, and the Philippines. In addition, India also participated in the conference. At this conference, the heads of government of each country announced the implementation of the Greater East Asia Declaration.</p>
<p>Promoting Cooperation and Friendship and Opening up a Sphere of Co-Prosperity</p>
<p>The gist of the five principles of the Greater East Asia Declaration lies in respecting the autonomy and independence of the countries and nations of Greater East Asia, promoting the cooperation and friendship of these ethnic nations, and in restoring the traditional creativity of Asia, which has been liberated, and further forming the foundation for the revitalization of East Asia on the basis of autonomy and independence. This is to expect these nations and countries to help each other, ensure the stability of East Asia, and open up a sphere of co-prosperity and co-existence.</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia Declaration is a Charter for Peace Construction</p>
<p>The major lessons that this Greater East Asia War has given to the people of East Asia are two. One is the trust in one's own strength. Britain and the United States have long deceived other nations with treaties or sweet words, trampled on the independent spirit of other nations, and used material civilization as a weapon to make their spirit and culture numb. However, today they have become aware that any sweet words and promises from others are not enough to be trusted. At the same time, they are also aware that their own demands can only be realized by their own strength. There is no good plan other than divine providence and self-help. Therefore, East Asia should also rely on the strength of the people of East Asia to achieve revitalization. The second lesson is the development of the Yamato spirit. The Yamato spirit not only exists in the Greater East Asia region, but also extends to the entire world and becomes the keynote of international relations. However, all nations and countries in the world develop resources, communicate culture, and further contribute to the progress of the world under the principles of equality and mutual benefit. The foundation of world peace can be completed here. Regarding this point, there are also clear instructions in the Greater East Asia Declaration. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Declaration is indeed a charter for world peace construction.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Attempt to Monopolize Distribution is Obvious</p>
<p>The enemy's purpose is to permanently bind Asia, infinitely exploit East Asia, and attempt to eliminate the enlightened Japan in Asia in order to realize their past means, which is to destroy Japan without war. Conversely, the current means is to destroy Japan, and even the entire East Asia, by force. Therefore, Japan rose up resolutely for its own and East Asia's self-preservation and self-defense. Therefore, this war is actually a war launched out of necessity in East Asia. Recently, knowledgeable people in Britain and the United States have had to admit this, and it has become a world problem. This is a well-known fact. However, in order to dominate the world, they rely on force and use the Cairo Conference resolution to replace the Greater East Asia Declaration, and remobilize to arbitrarily handle the future world and monopolize and dominate it. Their attempt to dominate the world has become obvious. What is most questionable is that they are now waging a world war on the one hand, and actively preparing for the future world war on the other.</p>
<p>Japan Will Persistently Carry Out the War with the Power and Courage of the Whole Country</p>
<p>This great war is a war to determine right and wrong. There will inevitably be a process of advance and retreat. However, the more the enemy advances, the more quickly they fall into danger, and the more opportunities they give us. Because the war of justice will surely win the final victory. This is the iron rule of ancient and modern times. After this cabinet change, Japan is still determined to maintain its foreign policy, closely cooperate with its allies, and bravely carry out this just war with the powerful momentum of the entire country. It will strive to implement the Greater East Asia Policy, which can be called a just policy. At the same time, it will further promote the good-neighborliness policy with the Yamato spirit, so as to permanently ensure the stability of East Asia and contribute to world peace. This is our sacred purpose.</p>
<p>Kwantung's Military Strength, Resource Production Achievements are Excellent</p>
<p>Dalian, 21st (Central News Agency) - Mr. Morioka, the Economic Minister of the Kwantung Leased Territory, recently made a statement on the salt production situation and food situation of Kwantung's military resources, as follows:</p>
<p>The salt production situation is very good due to the suitable climate, and it is expected that it will definitely break through this year's goal. In addition, the production of raw salt, which is essential for aircraft, is also quite good, so a significant increase in aircraft production next year is highly anticipated. Although there was no rainfall during the planting of agricultural crops, it has gradually improved recently, so it will be possible to ensure this year's harvest. The distribution of daily necessities such as cotton cloth is carried out simultaneously with Manchukuo. Thirty new agricultural warehouses are being built and will be completed this autumn.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Re-attack Kyushu, Still Failed to Achieve Results</h3>
<p>Twenty-three planes attacked the previous day; Sergeant Yamada and two others died heroically.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 6:00 a.m. on the 21st: About 20 U.S. Air Force planes stationed in Chongqing re-attacked northern Kyushu and western China around 0:00 a.m. on the 21st for about an hour. Japanese losses were minor.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 p.m. on the 21st: Regarding the enemy plane air raid on Kyushu and western China on the evening of the 20th, the main situation has become clear afterwards, as follows: The attacking enemy planes totaled about 80. Twenty-three enemy planes were shot down. Three of our intercepting planes were lost. Those who heroically died while attacking enemy planes are as follows: Army Trainee Chief Yamada Mamoru, Sergeant Nobe Shigeo, and Private First Class Takagi Denzo.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Air Force attacked northern Kyushu, Japan, at dusk on the 20th. They re-attacked late at night on the same day. A portion of them also invaded the northern part of China. Because they were intercepted by the Japanese army's air defense forces, they were unable to succeed and immediately fled. The enemy planes adopted a method of dispersed air raids, infiltrating one by one. Because it was impossible to find the target in the dark, they could not invade important areas. They only dropped bombs, incendiary bombs, and flares in the suburban mountains and fields. Although there were some fires on the ground, they were immediately extinguished, so the losses were very small. The enemy planes still used the fires caused by the daytime bombings, trying to expand the results of the night raids. However, the fires caused by the initial dusk air raid were also extinguished before the second air raid, so the enemy's attack failed to achieve any results. A total of about 80 American planes raided, of which about 30% were lost, and they did not achieve any results. All of their attempts failed. In addition to the enemy's loss of 23 planes, it is expected that there are also a considerable number that have not returned to base. On the contrary, in addition to the Japanese side's loss of three planes, some planes were also hit by bullets. The U.S. Army Department originally intended to use this bombing as the starting point for a regular air raid on Japan, so they had high expectations for it. However, because the Japanese plane's defenses were strict, the enemy air force's ambition was completely in vain.</p>
<h3>Central Memorial Week</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Central Department of the Chinese Kuomintang held the 215th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Party Department's auditorium at 10:00 a.m. on the 21st. More than 600 people attended, including central supervisory committee members and staff from various departments and committees, government agencies, and Kuomintang members. Minister of Discipline Wu Lanyi chaired the meeting. After performing the ceremony, Committee Member Guo Xiufeng reported on "The News and Communications Industry." The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - The National Government held a weekly meeting in the auditorium at 9:00 a.m. on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Japan Promotes Agricultural Land</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - In order to expand the planting area of ​​wheat, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce promoted the improvement of farmland last year. As a result, the planting area this year has increased to 1.87 million hectares. The planting area of ​​wheat next year will be further expanded. As a result of various studies, the area of ​​barren wasteland and the improvement of existing farmland has newly increased by 100,000 hectares, totaling 2.1 million hectares. With more than 40 days before the autumn planting season, farmers are working enthusiastically. Due to the lack of snow last winter and poor weather during the growing season, there was much pessimism in early spring regarding this year's wheat production. However, since mid-spring, the weather has improved, resulting in good results. The actual yield this spring is estimated to be 27 million shih or 26 million shih. According to a survey by the Japanese commercial authorities, the area of ​​barren land and newly developed forests utilized this year has reached more than 100,000 hectares. By thoroughly utilizing the waterless highlands of rivers, another 30,000 hectares of new farmland can be obtained, expanding the 2 million 800,000 hectares planned last year by 100,000 hectares. With such vast farmland, it is not difficult to obtain a wheat yield of 10 million shih.</p>
<h3>The Future of Chongqing-Communist Cooperation is Full of Hidden Reefs</h3>
<p>Central News Agency - Regarding the Chongqing-Communist disputes, although the Chongqing side has recently expressed hope for improved cooperation, the Communist Party is dissatisfied with the Chongqing side's statement, and its future is full of hidden reefs, making cooperation difficult. Recently, according to reliable sources, the recent Chongqing-Communist content is quite detailed, and is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The result of the previous Xi'an talks, the visit of the Chinese Communist Party representative Lin Zuhan to Chongqing, the beginning and end of the talks between the two sides, have yet to be clearly expressed. However, according to Liang Saicao, the propaganda minister of the Chongqing side, in a regular meeting with foreign reporters on July 26, he made a statement on the adjustment of Chongqing-Communist cooperation. According to Liang, there are too many difficulties in adjusting the relationship between the Chongqing and Communist parties.</p>
<p>Obstacles to resolution are: although the Communist Party is cooperating with the Kuomintang on the surface, the beliefs and statements of the Communist Party are absolutely opposite in fact. In order to resolve the county case between the Chongqing and Jiang parties, the following proposals were put forward: The Chongqing side recognizes the Communist Party as a legal entity. The 18th Group Army will be reorganized into four armies and twelve divisions. The reorganization of this army will be under the jurisdiction of the Chongqing side. The Chongqing side recognizes the continued existence of the border area government, and the areas under the jurisdiction of the provincial government will also be directly controlled by the Chongqing side. When the National Assembly is held in the future, the Chongqing side will recognize that all parties and factions enjoy equal status. Yan'an has not yet formally responded to this proposal of the Kuomintang, but has only put forward seventeen requests and conditions, which were negotiated by the Chongqing-Communist representatives three months ago, but in principle:</p>
<p>There are fundamental differences, and the Chongqing side is continuing its efforts to adjust the relationship between the two sides, and is trying to find ways to improve the situation, but the situation is quite difficult. Originally, from the viewpoint of the Chongqing side and the viewpoint of the Yan'an regime, Liang actually said that there was not much disagreement in fact, and that it had been partially resolved and a mutual understanding had been reached. After Liang made the above statement, Zhou Enlai of the Communist Party made a statement to the Xinhua Daily reporter in Yan'an on August 12, refuting Liang's statement. Zhou said that the improvement and adjustment of the Chongqing-Communist relationship can be responsible and clear, and the Chongqing side has not solved any of the Communist Party's problems in terms of specifics or small issues. As for the disagreement in the Communist Party's viewpoint and the difficulty in fundamental resolution, it is a kind of:</p>
<p>Erroneous view of those at home and abroad who are concerned about the relationship between the two parties, so there is considerable attention to the principles on which the two sides resolve the problem. In addition, the responsibility for the obstacles to resolution does not lie with the Communist Party, but with the dictatorship of the Kuomintang in Chongqing. Therefore, Liang's statement is not in line with the facts, because the Communist Party's proposal came first, and the Chongqing side's request came later. However, for the sake of compromise, the Communist Party changed the proposal to eleven written items and eight oral items, which were handed over to Chongqing representatives Zhang Zhizhong and Gong Jie on June 5. However, the Chongqing side's proposal is too far from the Communist Party's opinion, and Zhou's Zhengshi statement said that the 20 conditions proposed by the Communist Party are not twelve. Regarding the military importance of the Communist Party's conditions, implement democratic politics, guarantee the people's freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and suggestion.</p>
<p>Recognize the Communist Party and all parties and factions as legal entities, and release national political prisoners. Implement a truly democratic local public security.</p>
<p>The Chongqing side should organize five armies and sixteen divisions of the Communist army, and provide assistance in the form of supplies, ammunition, medicines, and various aid. Recognize the elected governments of the Sui, Gan, and Ning border regions and the base areas in North China, Central China, and South China as legal local autonomous governments. The Chongqing side should lift the military and economic blockade of each border area. Stop the military offensive against the Communist army. Request the Chongqing side to distribute the materials, weapons, ammunition, money, and aid provided by Britain and the United States to China in a fair proportion to the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Request that the Chongqing side jointly revoke the contempt for the Chinese Communist Party and the names of the traitors and military districts who attacked the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Stop the sabotage work of the security personnel against the 18th Group Army and the New Fourth Army. Prohibit the disclosure of rumors against the Chinese Communist Party in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Release the arrested personnel in various places. Stop the unreasonable inspection of the Xinhua Daily. Restore the CCP offices in Chongqing and Xi'an. Permit the staff of the two offices to:</p>
<p>Freedom of movement between Chongqing, Xi'an, and Yan'an, and be able to:</p>
<p>Reside in the area and be free to purchase daily necessities. Zhou Enlai once said that the conditions proposed by the Communist Party are still under negotiation and have not ended, and the hidden crisis has not passed. However, since Zhou made the statement, the Chongqing side has been quite dissatisfied. On the 16th of the month, Qian Cao met with foreign reporters and again raised this point, saying that the CCP situation is based on Chongqing's intelligence and Zhou's published statement, and there are many differences, and the facts obtained by the Chongqing side are contradictory, so it is pointed out that Zhou should bear considerable responsibility. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and the Communist Party and future cooperation are difficult to cooperate with in fact from the Communist Party's point of view.</p>

<h3>French Government Instructs Decoux to Be Granted Full Authority to Manage Vietnam: Vietnam to Convene Supreme Council Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Saigon, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese government recently announced that the French government has instructed Governor-General Decoux to be granted full authority to manage Vietnam. The general idea of the order is: The legal authority of the Governor-General of Vietnam has always been recognized by the domestic government. The government is deeply concerned about the current severe situation and is deeply concerned that there may be a break in the connection between the Vietnamese side and the domestic government in the future. It is specially granted to Governor-General Decoux the authority to make decisions in the future. This kind of measure has long been generally expected. From the perspective of the law promulgated on February 18, 1943, Article 90 of the bill states that if the telecommunications between Vietnam and the country are cut off, special powers will be granted. The law is stipulated based on Article 12 of the Constitution and the addendum to the same article, and is approved by the Cabinet Council. The original text is as follows: (Article 1) During the period when telecommunications between France and Indochina are cut off, according to existing laws, all powers that must be approved and decided by the domestic government are temporarily granted to the Governor-General. (Omitted below) The granting of this full power, that is, the French government's telegram to Governor Decoux, will have the same effect even if it is not completely cut off. Governor Decoux has actually obtained the same status as the previous heads in the implementation of wartime measures in Vietnam. From the Japanese perspective, Vietnam will be able to adhere to its original intention and increase its friendship in the future in fulfilling the defense agreement and maintaining friendly relations between the allied countries and Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Vietnamese government broadcast at 8:00 p.m. on the 20th that the government will grant all powers to Governor Decoux, so that he can obtain the dictatorial status of wartime measures. At the same time, it also issued a statement on the incident. From then on, Vietnam's wartime system will be strengthened. Under the leadership of Governor Decoux, it will move forward as part of Greater East Asia. To this end, Governor Decoux recently invited members of the Supreme Council and the heads of various states to hold talks. It is heard that the Supreme Council and the heads of state meetings will be officially convened starting on the 23rd. The chairman of the meeting, Governor Decoux, will formally express the fact that full power has been entrusted, and will ask for support. At the same time, agreements will be reached on promoting future cooperation with Japanese policies and important issues in Vietnam.</p>
<h3>American Reporter Praises Japan's Courageous Spirit, Admits US Operations Will Become More Difficult</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – Associated Press military reporters Johnsen and John Lantan, recently returned from the Mariana Islands front, spoke on the 19th at the Royal Madrid US Garage about the fighting spirit of Japanese soldiers as follows: "On the Saipan, Guam, and Tinian battle lines, we witnessed the courageous spirit of the Japanese army. They are not only unafraid of death, but each of their faces is filled with an expression of willing sacrifice. For example, when the American army attacked mountainous areas in Saipan, the Japanese soldiers shouted 'Banzai' and charged forward. The Japanese troops in Tinian and Guam also dared to launch courageous offensives. The Japanese army forgets everything during combat, so future Pacific battles will become increasingly difficult, and the US military will have to accept significant sacrifices."</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Formation Attacks Rabaul</p>
<p>Rabaul, 21st (Central News Agency) – Yesterday, a large formation of enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul on New Britain Island. After a resolute anti-aircraft defense by the Japanese army, the enemy suffered considerable losses and was forced to flee. One aircraft was shot down by intense Japanese fire into the sea east of Rabaul. Several American soldiers on board struggled for their lives in the water, in a very sorry state. Suddenly, an aircraft appeared at low altitude, and they thought they would be saved, so they raised their hands and shouted. Their joy and gratitude were imaginable. Unexpectedly, after circling two or three times, the American aircraft suddenly unleashed intense gunfire from its machine guns, strafing the comrades floating on the sea. Thus, the stranded men could not escape death in the end. They were unwilling to die with the aircraft, which is an inherent national characteristic of the American people, but how should such an act of shooting survivors after a battle be explained?</p>

Fierce fighting raged all day in the Trun area and further south, with extremely heavy losses on both sides. As a result, the enemy's fierce attacks were all blocked in the Torunai area. American tank and mechanized detachments advanced westward towards Argentan from the southwest, but made little progress. West of Caen, Canadian troops continued to attempt to make progress eastward and southeastward along the Dives River estuary.

<h3>German Ships in Gulf of Riga Bombard Soviet Positions, Soviet Advance in South Fails</h3>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Coastal News Agency reports: The German Navy, including several cruisers, entered the Gulf of Riga yesterday morning and bombarded Soviet positions and rear areas. The German army, navy, and air force are now all participating in the Eastern Front battles.

The Baltic Sea area is characterized by mobile warfare.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports that the Soviet army increased the number of new forces to the Iasi front on Friday and completed preparations for the offensive in this area. Then, on Saturday, they launched a large-scale offensive to the south with fierce artillery cover as a prelude. The first Soviet offensive, mainly infantry, created a gap of about two kilometers deep, but collapsed under the concentrated defensive fire of the German artillery and machine guns. The Red Army offensive between the Siret and Vistula rivers failed. In the bridgehead downstream of the Vistula River, a major battle unfolded as the Soviet army attempted to expand its gap to the northwest. A group of German combat units, temporarily cut off from communication in the area, regained contact with the main German forces in the area after a powerful counterattack. In the Omatton area, the Soviet army launched no less than fourteen linked-arm offensives throughout the day, covered by powerful artillery and tanks, but were all frustrated. The mid-section of the Eastern Front saw a major battle begin northeast of Warsaw, where the summer weather was oppressive, with temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius on the Celsius scale. After more than an hour of covering artillery fire, the Soviet army began an offensive along a broad front. In the fierce fighting between the two sides, casualties were very heavy. In southern Lithuania, the German army straightened its lines in the area. On the Latvian front, the Soviet army continued to attempt to break through west of Madona on the fourth day, but only broke through one gap, causing the German army to slightly withdraw its lines. West of Pskov, at the southeastern end of the Estonian front, the Soviet army continued to launch large-scale offensives to the west and north. The German forces operating in the area have been rescued by powerful main force squadrons in recent days, defeating the Soviet vanguard.</p>

Between Consfan Chai and Mondolfo, the enemy's vanguard penetrated the German line. Nineteen enemy tanks were destroyed in this battle. As the British army joined the battle with strong reinforcements, the German army had to withdraw its lines from the strongholds. East of Monteveglio, the enemy's offensive was repelled by a powerful German counterattack. The battle in the area continued throughout the night, and the situation was tense again this morning. British positions near Florence were heavily bombarded by German artillery. On the Ligurian coast, as American forces bombarded German positions, German forces retaliated with heavy artillery fire in the Tetera and Pisa areas.</p>

<h3>Elements of Victory (I)</h3>
<p>— Toshio Shiratori</p>
<p>——Annihilating the Ambition of the Enemy America——</p>
<p>Mr. Toshio Shiratori is currently 58 years old. He graduated from Tokyo University in the third year of the Taisho era and entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the fourth year of the Showa era, he served as the head of the Second Intelligence Division, and in the fifth year, he served as the head of the Intelligence Department. When Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, he fulfilled his major mission as a spokesperson. In the eighth year of the Showa era, he was stationed in Sweden as Minister Plenipotentiary, concurrently stationed in Norway and Denmark. In September of the thirteenth year of Showa, he was appointed as Ambassador to Italy, where he made great contributions to the conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy. He retired in the fifteenth year of Showa and served as a diplomatic advisor during the second Konoe cabinet. He is currently a member of the House of Representatives and the President of the Allied Comrades Association.</p>
<p>Japan has three enemies—England, America, and Chongqing. Here, I only want to examine how to defeat America, and I will discuss Chongqing separately for the time being. The abundance of American material resources is known to everyone today. It might even be said that it is overemphasized a bit. But is America merely a vehicle of material resources, and does it not possess anything in the spiritual sense? That is not necessarily the case. America is originally composed of various races, and its history of founding a country is short, so it cannot yet be said to be a complete nation. Once a war occurs, it harbors various weaknesses. But at least 60 to 70 percent of its citizens come from relatively excellent ethnic groups in Europe. However, when viewed as individuals, there are indeed people who cannot be viewed too highly.</p>
<p>The Source of the American People's Will to Fight</p>
<p>Three years have passed since the start of the war. The domestic situation in the United States has not yet developed any major flaws. Although the sacrifices of the war are great, the general public's will to fight is very strong, which is slightly different from what we thought before the war, and seems unexpected.</p>
<p>What is the reason for their strong will to fight? First, the American people are comfortable, and they believe that the war situation in the first year or two unfolded favorably. Second, military production has reached its peak today. This is very different compared to our country. Therefore, they are confident in their superiority in material resources. Third, they look down on certain races based on their sense of Anglo-American superiority. They speak freely and close their mouths with equality, but in reality, they are a people with very strong racial prejudice. This is the origin of the American domestic sense of superiority over blacks. This sense of superiority extends and expands to all colored races. They have an extraordinary sense of superiority, and even towards our country, which suffered a major blow in various battles, the sense of superiority temporarily gradually diminished, but later, with the changes in the war situation, it was revived again.</p>
<p>In the early stages of the war, they suffered a major defeat. In the end, they all had the determination to avenge Pearl Harbor. The government also wrote the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor" and worked hard to promote it. This had an unexpected impact on the simple American people, and their hostility towards Japan became very strong. In short, their will to fight is the intensity of their hostility toward Japan and the delusion of material resources. They are confident that final victory is almost certain, which comes from elements such as a sense of national superiority. When their will to fight is analyzed, it is like the above-mentioned, groundless and easily dispersed. Therefore, as long as the situation on the battlefield is reversed once, they immediately feel the sadness of disillusionment. I believe that even if the American people can endure any difficulties, even if the war becomes a long-term war, they will never have the enthusiasm and determination to persevere to the end.</p>
<p>The reason why Roosevelt hopes for a short-term war is that he actually wants to win in one fell swoop today when material resources have reached their peak and the national will to fight is at its highest. Otherwise, the morale of the people will inevitably slacken, and the atmosphere of war-weariness will spread. Moreover, the various domestic situations felt as a result of rectifying the wartime situation over the past three years will inevitably produce flaws. Before the reactionary period comes, failure to end the war will be unproductive. This is the reason why Roosevelt is eager to seek a short-term decisive battle. If the morale of the people in the rear does not waver, even if the war becomes a long-term war, the United States will not necessarily waver. What Roosevelt suffers from is that he has no confidence in the morale of the people and the national will to fight.</p>
<p>From this perspective of the spiritual elements of wartime America, it can be seen that its foundation is quite weak. Unlike Germany and Japan, they clearly recognize the purpose of the war and have a solid foundation to fight to the end regardless of any sacrifice.</p>
<p>The Ambition of the Jews</p>
<p>But here we must deeply consider that the will to fight of the American leaders after Roosevelt is quite solid and vigorous. Speaking of the American leaders, everyone knows that they are the financial cliques of money power, that is, the Jews and the accomplices of the mutual aid group. For the most part, from the perspective of the general American public, even if they fail in this war, neither Japan nor the country will seize America. It can be ended as long as it is agreed not to interfere in Asia and Europe. But even from the perspective of its leaders, that is, the Jews, this war is an attempt to complete the ambition of establishing a new world in one fell swoop after several centuries. If this war fails, not only will their dream of controlling the world be shattered in one fell swoop, but it will also cause large-scale anti-Semitism all over the world, leading the nation to destruction. Therefore, from their point of view, it is a war that they cannot lose no matter what. It is generally said that the British and American people have no purpose in war. The general public may be like this, but their leaders harbor the ambition to control the world. England, America, and pre-war France completely joined hands for this relationship. What is the Jewish world like? Generally, judging from their actions to date, its outline can be clearly seen. However, in the past, it was a world promoted by the two forces of capitalism and communism. This is better said to be a transitional strategy. I believe the ultimate goal is world communization. They also want to do this to England and America. They plan to use Jewish power to grasp the governments of these countries and directly control the world. Using all their strength and indirect methods of manipulating public opinion is not only a mild means, but also after the tragedy of this war, assuming they win, there is fear of pursuing responsibility for the war. Therefore, they cannot but use autocratic suppression no matter what. In the United States, Roosevelt even wanted to be re-elected for two terms as president, planning to become a dictator. On the one hand, he implemented a new distribution system, grasping the labor stage, and thus the foundation of dictatorship was already solid. They believed that America's leaning towards communism was imminent.</p>
<p>The ideal world of the Jews is to use this kind of power with dictatorial power to suppress non-Jewish nations. On the one hand, they use the hundreds of billions of gold yuan they have accumulated to issue Jewish currency, suppressing the world politically and economically. Thus, in the final stage, they worship the God of Iwahber as the absolute God of the universe, causing all mankind to bow down to this God, making the long-cherished wish of Jewish hope. From this perspective, it is easy to see how the Jewish non-hope violates the original meaning of the Japanese national polity, that is, the grand plan of the Eight-Cord Universe.</p>
<p>Don't some people say that in New Guinea, in the Marshall Islands, or in the Mariana Islands, the wariness of the enemy soldiers who come to invade at the cost of vast sacrifices is not extremely hot and cannot be underestimated? But this is their leaders' domestic propaganda strategy. As mentioned above, not only Americans, but the struggle of mankind is a common struggle, and it is the origin of their will to fight. Probably any nation, once on the battlefield, fights quite bravely. They believe that victory is near, so a certain degree of bravery is not incomprehensible.

<h3>Oil and Grain Control Committee Handles Registration of Cooking Oil Inventory to Prevent Hoarding and Manipulation, Suppress Market Prices</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization, the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the Commerce Control Association is actively studying concrete plans for the implementation of unified management of oil and grains. However, in view of the recent sharp rise in edible oil prices, although due to the increase in consumption, speculation by general speculators and high prices are also the biggest problem.</p>
<p>In order to understand the status of edible oil storage and sales in the Shanghai area, prevent hoarding and speculation, and suppress market prices, the Temporary Registration Rules for Cooking Oil Inventory Sales in the Shanghai Area have been formulated and agreed upon with the relevant authorities. All manufacturers, vendors, and retailers must register all inventory with the Shanghai District Cooking Oil Industry Association (i.e., the old Edward Road, No. 15), before the 26th of this month. The registration rules are noted as follows:</p>
<p>Registration Rules</p>
<p>Temporary Registration Rules for Cooking Oil Inventory Sales in the Shanghai Area: Article 1: These rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Articles 5 and 6 of the Provisional Measures for Unified Management of Oil and Grains in order to clarify the status of edible oil storage and sales in the Shanghai area. The aforementioned Shanghai area refers to the area within the control line. Article 2: Manufacturers, vendors, and retailers shall register all inventory with the Shanghai District Cooking Oil Industry Association (Union) (hereinafter referred to as the Association) before August 26. However, those with inventory of less than five units may be exempted from registration. Article 3: From August 26, manufacturers shall register the quantity of products and sales daily, vendors shall register the quantity of sales daily, and retailers shall register the quantity of sales every half month with the Association. Article 4: The registration forms for the previous two articles shall be printed and distributed by the Association according to a separately determined style. Article 5: The Association shall forward the registration information stipulated in the second and third articles to the Federation and submit it to the Oil and Grain Control Committee of the National Commercial Control Association. Article 6: The Association shall issue a certificate of compliance with the registration requirements of the second and third articles to members who have complied with the registration requirements. Article 7: Members who violate the provisions of these rules, or who conceal or falsely report information, shall be reported to the competent authorities in accordance with the Regulations on Punishing Hoarding of Major Commodities for punishment in accordance with the law. Article 8: These rules shall be submitted to the National Commercial Control Association for record.</p>
<p>Definitely Not Buying</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Oil and Grain Control Committee, the purpose of the implementation of these rules is not to buy up inventory or to impose any restrictions on sales. It is only intended to clarify the circulation process, prevent speculation by non-industry personnel and unscrupulous colleagues in the spirit of merchant self-governance.</p>
<h3>Special Tax Office Corruption Case, Three More Detained, Assistant Section Chief and Two Directors</h3>
<p>The municipal financial authorities, in order to deal with the corruption case in the Special Tax Section, have detained four people: the head of the section, Zou Shaoji, the assistant head of the section, Xu Shengui, and the directors Wu Songling and Zhu Junqing, pending interrogation. The position of head of the Special Tax Section is temporarily held concurrently by Shi Hua, the head of the Third Section, dispatched by the Bureau. It is found that Mr. Shi has served as a lawyer in the Finance Office of the former Public Works Bureau since 1932. After the Financial Bureau took over the Finance Office of the district, he served as the head of the Land Tax Section. It is expected that he will be able to be conscientious in the future.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Registration Points, Clause Corrections</h3>
<p>The Economic Security Office previously published the "Key Points of Food Rice Registration Procedures". The first and third clauses are corrected as follows:</p>
<p>Key Points of Economic Security Office Procedures:</p>
<p>"Food rice that has been registered, even if it is within the registered amount," is a mistake for "even if it is above the registered amount."</p>
<p>"After registering with the Goods Distribution Office of this Office, if new rice is purchased, and the remaining registered rice exceeds the specified amount, it must be submitted to this Office in writing within three days," should be changed to "After registering the remaining rice after registering with this Office and the Municipal Goods Distribution Office, and the combined amount of purchasing new rice, if it exceeds the previously registered amount, it must be submitted to this Office in writing within three days."</p>
<h3>Information Department of the Japanese Embassy: Yesterday's Press Conference</h3>

<p>held a standing committee meeting the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The standing committee members, chief secretaries, and deputy chief secretaries attended.</p>
<p>Minister of Social Welfare, Mr. Ding Mocun, was respectfully invited to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<p>Many important matters were discussed, and it was decided to strictly implement the "National Banquet Restriction Measures."</p>

<p>It was also decided to jointly convene a meeting within the week with the Social Welfare Bureau</p>
<p>to talk with responsible persons from various restaurants and hotels. Furthermore, the association, in view of the annual</p>
<p>autumn occurrence of so-called Taiping Gongjiao or Yulan Shenghui events, deemed such</p>
<p>unnecessary activities inappropriate during this critical period of decisive battle. Therefore, it was decided to strictly</p>
<p>prohibit them. It is heard that a meeting will be convened with representatives from the baojia system soon to discuss</p>
<p>how to cooperate and implement this measure, and at the same time, a request will be submitted to the governing authority to issue an order of prohibition.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Unifies Management of Advertising Business</h3>
<p>Since the advertising business in this city</p>
<p>was transferred to the unified management of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau in February of this year,</p>
<p>the bureau, based on practical needs, first focused on the eight districts</p>
<p>and began implementing the regulations based on the city's Advertising Management Rules.</p>
<p>This has now come to a conclusion. On the first of this month, the First District</p>
<p>Office was ordered to be abolished. From now on, municipal administration</p>
<p>will be unified, and advertising matters within the district will be handled directly by the bureau.</p>
<p>Any advertisements that obstruct the city's appearance or violate regulations</p>
<p>will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>In the future, if merchants need to erect any advertisements,</p>
<p>they can directly apply to the advertising section of the bureau's Second Division in accordance with regulations. All</p>
<p>advertisements that have already been erected within the former First District</p>
<p>must be re-applied for replacement from this bureau</p>
<p>to avoid being penalized. It is also heard that the bureau has revised</p>
<p>the measures for managing advertising companies in this city</p>
<p>and submitted them to the municipal government for approval and implementation. All businesses engaged in advertising</p>
<p>in this city, in addition to holding a business license from the Economic Bureau, must</p>
<p>also register with the bureau and obtain a business certificate for advertising companies</p>
<p>before they can operate.</p>

<p>$300 will receive an honorary ticket.</p>
<p>These three types of tickets, as well as the special honorary tickets, will continue to be given out at the Guanxin Theater tomorrow until they are all distributed.</p>

<p>Chinese and Western Music Charity Performance to Support Scholarships</p>
<p>Lianhua</p>
<p>Bank</p>
<p>in this city,</p>
<p>in order to</p>
<p>help impoverished students and support scholarships,</p>
<p>is collaborating with this newspaper and the Xinwen Bao to host</p>
<p>a large-scale music concert, inviting</p>
<p>renowned musicians from Shanghai to gather and perform.</p>
<p>All ticket revenue will be donated to scholarships.</p>
<p>The music community is very supportive of this and is enthusiastically participating.</p>
<p>This will be the largest music concert in the city in recent years.</p>
<p>The concert will be divided into two sections: Chinese and Western.</p>
<p>Chinese Music</p>
<p>The Chinese Music</p>
<p>section will be led by the Chinese Music Research Association,</p>
<p>with Mr. Sun Yude and Mr. Han Zhenhan in charge,</p>
<p>and Mrs. Tang Shixuan as an advisor.</p>
<p>Zhang Ziqian, Ye Dami, Zhu Wenyi, Chen Zhanggeng, Sun Zhidao,</p>
<p>Shen Rixin, Cao Xuzhen, Han Zhenjia,</p>
<p>Sun Zhixin, Zhou Hui, and Misses Shen Shuwu and</p>
<p>Pu Yu will perform. Classical musical pieces</p>
<p>such as "Van Palace," "High Mountains and Flowing Water," "Xunyang Nocturne,"</p>
<p>"Huaiyin Pingchu," and "Falling Geese on the Sandbank"</p>
<p>will all be performed. In addition, there will be guqin and sword dance</p>
<p>performances, creating a serene and elegant atmosphere, unprecedented. The president of the Chinese Music Research Association, Sun Yude,</p>
<p>is one of the few experts in dongxiao and pipa in the country. He previously traveled</p>
<p>to Europe and America and gave public performances.</p>
<p>He was very popular in the United States, and his box office success</p>
<p>broke all previous records. After returning to China, Mr. Sun</p>
<p>gathered his colleagues and continued his research.</p>
<p>He has performed in this city several times and received great praise.</p>
<p>In the latter half of June of this year, he gave his sixth performance</p>
<p>at the New Heart Grand Theater, which was highly praised by both Chinese and foreign audiences.</p>
<p>Western Music</p>
<p>The Western Music</p>
<p>section will be led by the National Conservatory of Music,</p>
<p>with Mr. Liang Yueyin and Mr. Huang Yuanyin in charge,</p>

<p>piano solo, Ji Hanwen's cello solo, Wang Wenyu's and Huang Daoyin's vocal solos,</p>
<p>a three-part female chorus conducted by Huang Yongxi,</p>
<p>and a large chorus of hundreds of people, making it a magnificent and unprecedented event.</p>
<p>The musicians participating in the performance</p>
<p>are renowned in Shanghai and also have a place</p>
<p>in the national music scene. For example, Mr. Ma Sihong</p>
<p>is Mr. Ma Sitong's younger brother. The Ma family</p>
<p>is famous in the music world, and both brothers</p>
<p>are known for their violin skills. Miss Pan Meibo</p>
<p>is one of the leading pianists in the country, and she has great insights</p>
<p>into the works of Chopin and Liszt. Miss Wang Wenyu was invited by Madam Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling,</p>
<p>to sing solo in Hong Kong, and her name carries great weight. Huang Yongxi</p>
<p>is proficient in various instruments and is skilled in composing,</p>
<p>earning him the title of "the Schubert of China."</p>
<p>In addition, Ji Hanwen's cello and Gong Yuanyin's tenor,</p>

<h3>The City Government Forbids the Issuance of French Charity Lottery Tickets; They Have Never Applied to Our Government for Approval</h3>
<p>Since the issuance of the "French Charity Lottery,"</p>
<p>they have never applied to our government for approval,</p>
<p>which is not in compliance with the law.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the issuance of lottery tickets is by no means ordinary commerce.</p>
<p>Not only are foreigners not allowed to issue them within our country,</p>
<p>but even our own people,</p>
<p>unless specially approved by the governing authority,</p>
<p>may not rashly issue them. Furthermore, it has been found that the purchasers</p>
<p>of the French lottery tickets are purely our people,</p>
<p>while the beneficiaries are not our compatriots,</p>
<p>which is especially contrary to legal principles and human sentiments.</p>
<p>After receiving accusations from all sectors, the Ministry of Social Welfare</p>
<p>sent people to investigate and confirmed the facts. In addition to notifying the</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance for their attention,</p>
<p>it also requested the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to order the</p>
<p>company to stop issuing the lottery tickets by the end of August,</p>
<p>handle the closure, and order the public announcement of the past accounts.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government of this city</p>
<p>forwarded the order to the Social Welfare Bureau and the Police Bureau,</p>
<p>dispatching personnel to carry it out. The Social Welfare Bureau further notified all shops to</p>
<p>prohibit the sale of French charity lottery tickets.</p>
<p>At the same time, the French Consul in Shanghai</p>
<p>also forwarded an order to the company to stop issuing the lottery tickets and</p>
<p>close as scheduled.</p>
<p>Report from the Ministry of Social Welfare</p>
<p>The report from the Ministry of Social Welfare regarding</p>
<p>the investigation into the inside story of the lottery tickets is extracted as follows: The reason for the establishment:</p>
<p>During the Shanghai Incident in 1932, refugees from the suburbs</p>
<p>poured into the city. Those who survived the war and were suffering from hunger and cold were pitiful. The French</p>
<p>Father Jacquinot, witnessing this situation, appealed to all parties</p>
<p>to demarcate refugee areas in Nanshi,</p>
<p>and millions of refugees were spared from freezing and starvation.</p>
<p>However, the expenses were enormous, and all the funds at that time</p>
<p>were obtained through donations, which were far from sufficient.</p>
<p>The following autumn, the French Jesuits and others</p>
<p>initiated the charity lottery, with the surplus after prizes and expenses</p>
<p>being used to maintain the refugee area. This was the reason for the establishment of the French Lottery. General organization: The operating structure</p>
<p>of the French Charity Lottery</p>
<p>is a company.</p>
<p>When it was established, it was registered with the French Consulate General</p>
<p>in accordance with French law, with no</p>
<p>official dividends, and all authority was controlled by the board of directors. The board has one chairman</p>
<p>and five directors. In addition to one each from Norway and Switzerland, the rest are all French.</p>
<p>Below the board of directors is a committee for distributing charity funds, with eight members.</p>
<p>One each from Norway, Switzerland, and China,</p>
<p>and the remaining five seats are all French. The lottery drawing committee has four people,</p>
<p>one from France and three from China, but</p>
<p>the Chinese are only in name and have never actually</p>
<p>participated. The auditors are also two French. Distribution standards: The distribution</p>
<p>of the income from this lottery is as follows:</p>
<p>Prizes account for 50%, and expenses</p>
<p>and charitable donations each account for</p>
<p>25%. Recent developments: After the National</p>
<p>Government returned to the capital, the villages gradually became peaceful,</p>
<p>and the refugees continued to return. The relief work in the Nanshi</p>
<p>refugee area came to an end.</p>
<p>However, the charity lottery continued</p>
<p>to be issued without interruption. The proceeds</p>
<p>were mostly donated to foreign chambers of commerce,</p>
<p>while the benefits to our Chinese people were few,</p>
<p>which is far from the original purpose of the establishment. Note:</p>
<p>The issuance of lottery tickets should normally be approved by the</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance. In the case of charity lottery tickets,</p>
<p>the permission of the Ministry of Social Welfare should also be obtained.</p>
<p>When the Shanghai French Charity Lottery was first issued,</p>
<p>it coincided with the westward relocation of the former government,</p>
<p>and it was not filed with our National Government for approval in accordance with the law, which was forgivable. However,</p>
<p>from 1940, when the National Government returned to the capital, until</p>
<p>last year, when the concessions were returned, it was not</p>
<p>submitted to our competent authorities for approval, which is improper.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this type of public undertaking</p>
<p>is by no means ordinary commerce, and no one</p>
<p>can operate it. Even if they are Chinese, they</p>
<p>must be specially approved before they can organize it.</p>
<p>It is against international practice for foreign businesses to issue lottery tickets</p>
<p>within our country. Moreover, since the lottery began,</p>
<p>its income and expenditure situation</p>
<p>and distribution standards have never been publicly announced,</p>
<p>and its responsible persons are all French, who monopolize and control it,</p>
<p>which is unavoidable. Therefore, there are many suspicions and criticisms from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Most Primary and Secondary Schools in This City are Setting Up Free Enrollment Quotas</h3>
<p>The examination for the scholarship fund for impoverished</p>
<p>students organized by the Municipal Education Association has been</p>
<p>completed, but the number of students admitted is limited</p>
<p>due to funding constraints. Therefore,</p>
<p>there are countless impoverished students in this city who are unable to attend school. Therefore,</p>
<p>the education associations in the central districts of the city previously requested</p>
<p>all schools to increase the number of free enrollment quotas in order to remedy the situation. It is now learned</p>
<p>that all member schools of the current Municipal Education Association</p>
<p>have responded one after another, and within the possible range</p>
<p>of the financial situation of each school,</p>
<p>they will add a number of free enrollment quotas so that</p>
<p>a portion of impoverished students can continue their studies.</p>

<p>must be fully mobilized to assist the police in directing traffic, maintaining order,</p>
<p>and taking various emergency measures. Citizens must also, upon hearing the alarm,</p>
<p>take necessary preparations with swift action. At the same time, attention should be paid to noise prevention</p>
<p>to cope with the occurrence of emergencies. Police and baojia citizens must cooperate closely to safeguard the safety of Great Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Navy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ishida Yutaka</p>
<p>Long before anyone else was up, Takao had arrived in Kure, thinking it the most appropriate time.</p>
<p>Because he could meet Shinji before his work started, he could discuss lingering in Kure. As for the task of discussing his younger sister's marriage, of course, it was always on his mind. There was no need for the author to elaborate on that. In addition, he still held dear the promise Shinji had made earlier to visit the naval port. Takao tried his best not to disturb Shinji's military duties, and his efforts were rewarded.</p>
<p>(Disturbing Shinji's sleep, perhaps he'll forgive me!)</p>
<p>Takao boarded the bus he remembered. The early summer sun, rising earlier now, had not yet peeked over the horizon. The sound of the wooden clogs dragged along by Kure's most famous workers had not yet echoed on the roads.</p>
<p>Takao got off at a bus stop at Yama Hirachi-sei, and walked forward along the misty river. His heart was pounding anxiously. This was the joy of bringing a gift to Shinji, but also shyness.</p>
<p>(Everything else is easy to say, only the marriage thing is hard to bring up. If I say, "Please take my sister," Shinji will definitely blush. If it were me, I would. It's just impossible to say "My sister likes you.")</p>
<p>Takao now found it difficult to execute the task he had so readily volunteered for. A letter from his mother had also mentioned this difficulty, and he scratched his head and ears, feeling the challenge.</p>
<p>Before long, he arrived at the front of Shinji's dormitory. The windows of Shinji's second-floor study were still closed.</p>
<p>(It seems he's still sleeping. It's a bit rude to wake him.)</p>
<p>But Shinji wasn't the kind of polite friend who needed to be circled around first.</p>
<p>He turned the handle of the front door, but it was locked from the inside and wouldn't open. He went around to the back door to check the kitchen, where the landlady, who had just gotten up, stared at Takao with a surprised expression.</p>
<p>"Has Tani-kun not gotten up yet?"</p>
<p>"Oh, the guest has arrived so early..."</p>
<p>The landlady hastily tidied her messy hair and clothes, and asked politely.</p>
<p>"I'm passing through here on the way back to Tokyo, and I'm here to trouble you again. Due to the train schedule, I arrived too early."</p>
<p>Takao wanted to go upstairs from the kitchen, and ran into the house.</p>
<p>"But, I'm really sorry, Mr. Tani is no longer here..."</p>
<p>The landlady said with regret.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"Due to his duties, he suddenly moved out two days ago, —"</p>
<p>"Then he's sailed out?"</p>
<p>"But he didn't say anything. Not only Mr. Tani, but all naval personnel keep their mouths shut, —"</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>The idea of preventing spies is truly widespread in Kure. The landlady's words might be intentionally fabricated, but the fact that Shinji was not in the dormitory was indeed true.</p>
<p>When Takao met Shinji a week ago, he had left with the impression that he was very busy, so it wasn't strange that he couldn't meet this time. But he felt an endless sense of loss that he hadn't been able to discuss his sister's marriage.</p>
<p>However, he thought that the marriage task could be solved in another way.</p>
<p>(It doesn't matter, I can write a letter, or come again. A place like Kure isn't too far to visit as many times as necessary, —)</p>
<p>He returned to the station again, ate breakfast, and took the train to Onomichi. He strolled through the ancient port in the Seto Inland Sea, gazing at the scenery that became material for paintings of a calm sea, until it was time for the express train to Tokyo at 2:30, when he stopped looking at the scenery.</p>
<p>This train was also very crowded, and he didn't get a seat until Kobe. Because he was too tired from the train ride last night, he immediately fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was almost seven in the morning when he arrived at Tokyo Station. Apartment living was uncomfortable, and even if he went back, no one would prepare a meal for him, so he ate some breakfast at the Tokyo Station cafeteria.</p>
<p>While eating, he suddenly remembered that he had to deliver the gift from his father to the painter Ichiki. Because it was a Satsuma ware vase, he was very afraid of breaking it, so he only put this one item in his suitcase.</p>
<p>He returned to the platform and took the Yamanote Line. Then he changed to the Ikegami Line at Gotanda.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the painter's house in Senzoku, it was still early morning, but because it was early summer, he was sweating profusely. It was just the time when the painter had just gotten up and was washing his face.</p>
<p>"My father instructed me to extend his special greetings to you. My father wanted to give you a Kirukan-style confectionery, and inquired everywhere, but lately, due to a shortage of ingredients, Kagoshima has not been able to make it."</p>
<p>Saying this, Takao handed over the vase box.</p>
<p>"I don't like that kind of confectionery! But how is Kagoshima? Is it still the same as before? Are the samurai still overbearing?"</p>
<p>"But it's not that bad."</p>
<p>Takao replied, but when he heard the painter Ichiki's usual tone, he felt like he had returned to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Later, they talked about painting until after ten o'clock, when he took his leave. He was too tired, so he wanted to take a nap, and went straight back to the Onuma Apartments.</p>
<p>"Oh, you're back? That was fast! Letters came while you were away."</p>
<p>The landlady handed over four or five letters, one of which was in Shinji's handwriting and in a very thick envelope. (134)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen Distributes Corn Flour—Registered Charities Should Claim Their Allotment Quickly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen, due to the sharp rise in rice prices in the city,</p>
<p>and the resulting impact on the poor, has been gradually purchasing</p>
<p>corn flour, totaling 114 dan and 85 jin, to be distributed to the poor during the winter.</p>
<p>Following a resolution by the standing directors' meeting, it was decided to distribute it early, and the full amount was allocated to various charitable organizations in the city. After this</p>
<p>news was announced, more than ten charities</p>
<p>registered with the kitchen. On the 20th, the board of directors resolved to distribute the flour as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Old People's Home, Shanghai South Congee Kitchen, 25 dan each. Xin Puyu Hall, 11 dan. Cilianhui Relief Home, Xujiahui Infant Asylum, 10 dan each. Tushanwan Orphanage, 7 dan.</p>
<p>China Education Morality Society, 5 dan. Christian Orphanage, Andang Hospital, 4 dan each. Fuyu Workers' Orphanage,</p>
<p>China Leprosy Relief Association, Pingjiang Children's Home, Baoan Old People's Home, 3 dan each. Ailaoju, 1 dan and 85 jin.</p>
<p>The above institutions are requested to</p>
<p>prepare an official letter within three</p>
<p>days and claim their allotment from the Shanghai Buddhist Congee Kitchen at the Ximen Guandi Temple,</p>
<p>so that the distribution can be completed as soon as possible. This is earnestly hoped.</p>

<h3>Issue Payment for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Soon</h3>
<p>— Li Maoyong</p>
<p>Since the government issued a clear order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth last August,</p>
<p>it has been over a year now. During this long year, the Shanghai office of the General Chamber of Commerce's purchasing and inspection work</p>
<p>has been intermittent and has not yet been fully completed. Good merchants who have followed the government's orders, reporting all their yarn and cloth stock to the authorities and carefully preserving it, hope daily that the General Chamber of Commerce will come to inspect it and issue term deposit slips as soon as possible, so that they can fulfill the government's mandate. Some have already been inspected, but many have not yet been inspected. As for the payment, those who have not been inspected have not been able to receive it, which is perfectly reasonable from the perspective of the General Chamber of Commerce (when they will be inspected is another matter). Those who have been inspected have not received payment for two or three months.</p>
<p>Among the merchants, some who were inspected in May or June have been</p>
<p>waiting at the door of the General Chamber of Commerce every day, and more than 60</p>
<p>days have passed without the accounting being completed.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this month, there have been virtually</p>
<p>no cases of completed calculations. The announcement board is blank every day, and if someone asks, there is</p>
<p>no concrete answer.</p>
<p>In view of the above facts, we</p>
<p>hope that:</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce should stipulate a specific time limit after the yarn</p>
<p>and cloth inspection is completed, within which</p>
<p>the price will be calculated and term deposit slips issued.</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce must complete the inspection of all uninspected yarn</p>
<p>and cloth within a certain number of days.</p>
<p>The order of issuing payment</p>
<p>should be based on the date of inspection,</p>
<p>and should not be advanced out of order.</p>
<p>The General Chamber of Commerce is an</p>
<p>organization of merchants, and its motto is "Fairness</p>
<p>and Integrity." We believe that it will accept the above</p>
<p>suggestions and alleviate the undue suffering of merchants.</p>
<h3>Obligatory Drug Addiction Rehabilitation—Third Batch Completes Treatment</h3>
<p>This office has contracted with the Nantu Road branch of the China Educational</p>
<p>Moral Society to establish a temporary, free, drug addiction rehabilitation center,</p>
<p>where the third group of ten addicts, all</p>
<p>women, has completed treatment. Yesterday</p>
<p>morning, a farewell ceremony was held in the society's auditorium,</p>
<p>attended by more than a hundred guests from all walks of life. Mr. Li Huifa presided</p>
<p>over the ceremony, delivering an opening address, exposing the scourge</p>
<p>of opium without reservation, and strongly urging those who had completed treatment</p>
<p>not to repeat their mistakes, and isolate themselves from the public. His words were sincere and moving. Next, the chief physician of the center, Yang Yusheng, Sun Weirui, the representative of the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Dr. Sun Shanjun,</p>
<p>and guests delivered speeches, filled with</p>
<p>encouragement, moving those who heard them. Finally, a representative of the addicts delivered a thank-you speech, reporting on the drug addiction rehabilitation process, and one woman said that</p>
<p>she had to inject over two hundred moka needles every day, and another woman said she was smoking over eight hundred yuan of heroin a day, all of them were safely removed by the "St. Kang Doping"</p>
<p>injection. Most addicts often have a fear</p>
<p>that drug addiction rehabilitation is painful,</p>
<p>but the proven circumstances show</p>
<p>that it is not always the case. As long as there is determination,</p>
<p>there is no reason why it cannot be removed. We</p>
<p>have been lifted out of the sea of suffering by the China Educational Moral Society,</p>
<p>and we are grateful beyond measure, and we should</p>
<p>vigorously promote it, so that fellow sufferers can also</p>
<p>be rescued from the maze and reach the other shore.</p>
<p>After the speech, they took a photo and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Maternity Hospital Attached to Health Demonstration Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Demonstration Zone,</p>
<p>sponsored by the Chinese Health Association, is equipped with four departments:</p>
<p>Health Care, Prevention, Medical Treatment, and Training.</p>
<p>Within the Health Care Department, there are three sections: Women's and Infant Health, School Health, and</p>
<p>Factory Health. Recently, a</p>
<p>maternity hospital has been attached, which is divided into inpatient and outpatient</p>
<p>delivery services. In the past two months,</p>
<p>more than ten women have safely left the hospital.</p>
<p>The fees are especially low, and if the family is indeed</p>
<p>poor, they can apply for preferential treatment.</p>
<p>Anyone who has any</p>
<p>questions about prenatal and postnatal women's and infant health, and health care matters,</p>
<p>can go directly to the area for examination,</p>
<p>or notify them by letter or telephone, and a public health nurse will be sent</p>
<p>to visit the family, free of charge.</p>
<p>Residents living in the Hongqiao, Fahua Town, and</p>
<p>Xujiahui areas of West Shanghai should pay attention. The</p>
<p>area's address is 349 Hongqiao Road,</p>
<p>(behind the former Jiaotong University, near</p>
<p>Fan Yu Road) telephone number is 70045. (Su)</p>
<p>The late famous doctor Chen Xiaobao of Sanpailou in the Nanshi area</p>
<p>was a specialist in gynecology,</p>
<p>and was renowned in the medical field. His sons, Pan Gen and Danian, inherited their father's skills and practiced medicine,</p>
<p>and also gained great reputation. Furthermore, they are kind-hearted</p>
<p>and considerate to patients, treating the poor without hesitation.</p>
<p>They now have a clinic on Julaida Road,</p>
<p>west of Albert Road. Outpatient services are available until 4:00 PM.</p>
